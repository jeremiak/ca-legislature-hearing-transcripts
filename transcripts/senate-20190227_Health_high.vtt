00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:12.412
GOOD AFTERNOON AND THE CALL THE

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:13.913
ORDERS THIS INFORMATIONAL

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:14.581
HEARING OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE

00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:16.015
ON HEALTH ON IMPROVING

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:17.183
PERFORMANCE IN ALIGNING

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.219
INCENTIVES IN COMMERCIAL HEALTH

00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:20.653
INSURANCE AND MEDICAL.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.655
AND I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE

00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:24.357
THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING --

00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:26.092
CERTAINLY THERE'S A LOT OF

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:28.194
INTERESTS IN HEALTH CARE --

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:31.564
EXPANDING ACCESS TO MORE PEOPLE

00:00:31.631 --> 00:00:33.400
WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:34.734
DESPITE THE GAINS WE THREE MADE

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:36.403
WITH THE ACA WE STILL HAVE A BY

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:38.338
THINK ABOUT 7% --

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:39.706
70% PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL

00:00:39.773 --> 00:00:40.540
UNINSURED --

00:00:40.607 --> 00:00:42.342
CERTAINLY COST TO SOMETHING THAT

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:45.145
IS OF GREAT CONCERN AS A AS NOT

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:45.578
ONLY --

00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:47.180
GOVERNMENT BUT ALSO --

00:00:47.247 --> 00:00:50.617
INDIVIDUALS AND EMPLOYERS --

00:00:50.683 --> 00:00:55.622
AND AND UNIONS WHO --

00:00:55.688 --> 00:00:58.591
US BUT ALSO WE THINK ABOUT --

00:00:58.658 --> 00:00:59.726
THOSE COSTS WE WANT TO THINK

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:01.194
ABOUT HOW WE DELIVERING CARE BE

00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:02.829
SURE THAT PEOPLE NOT ONLY HAVE

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:03.997
COVERAGE BUT THEY ACTUALLY TRULY

00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:05.432
OF ACCESS AND ACCESS TO QUALITY

00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:06.132
CARE.

00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:07.834
AND THAT ACTUALLY WE INVEST AND

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:10.703
CREATE INCENTIVES FOR PEOPLE --

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:11.838
TO TO PROVIDE QUALITY CARE THAT

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:13.973
CAN BE MORE COST EFFECTIVE AND

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.642
HELP LOWER THE LONG TERM COST

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:16.776
CURVE.

00:01:16.843 --> 00:01:17.610
I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT --

00:01:17.677 --> 00:01:18.845
CITIES HAVE SHOWN APPROXIMATELY

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:21.214
40% OF ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE AT

00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:23.483
LEAST ONE CHRONIC CONDITION --

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:24.384
SO LOOK --

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:25.251
AND THAT --

00:01:25.318 --> 00:01:26.986
THAT REPRESENTS PRACTICALLY

00:01:27.053 --> 00:01:28.388
7280% OF OUR HEALTH CARE

00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:29.456
SPENDING.

00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:31.157
SO WE REALLY WANT TO THINK ABOUT

00:01:31.224 --> 00:01:32.392
HOW WE'RE GOING TO NOT ONLY BEEN

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:34.294
THE COST CURVE BUT ALSO IMPROVE

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.428
OUR QUALITY --

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:37.263
IT IS LOOKING AT CHRONIC DISEASE

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.065
MANAGEMENT AND HOW DO WE HOW DO

00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:40.400
WE CREATE THE KIND OF STRUCTURES

00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:43.002
INCENTIVES THAT ENCOURAGE PEOPLE --

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:46.873
TO INVEST IN CHRONIC DISEASE I

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:47.440
THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT

00:01:47.507 --> 00:01:47.841
CERTAINLY.

00:01:47.907 --> 00:01:50.743
WE OFTEN HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.012
THIS -- WE

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:55.515
THAT -- WITH

00:01:55.582 --> 00:01:56.883
CHRONIC CONDITIONS SUCH AS

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.385
DIABETES OR ASTHMA OR OTHER

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:02.088
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES --

00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:03.823
OFTEN THERE THE EXPENSES OF

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.425
THEIR THAT CARE MAY ACTUALLY BE

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:07.227
GREATER THAN THE PREMIUMS THEY

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:09.329
PAY AND SO --

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:10.096
RISK BRING ALWAYS ASIA HEALTH

00:02:10.163 --> 00:02:11.698
PLANS OFTEN HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

00:02:11.764 --> 00:02:13.600
LIKE HOW DOOR TO FINANCE THEM

00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:15.168
THEY HAVE TO HAVE FOR THE CALL

00:02:15.235 --> 00:02:16.369
PROPER CASE MIX RIGHT.

00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:17.136
SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE ENOUGH

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:18.638
HEALTHY PEOPLE TO PAY FOR THE

00:02:18.705 --> 00:02:20.707
PEOPLE WHO ARE WHO HAVE THESE.

00:02:20.773 --> 00:02:22.809
CONDITIONS AND UNFORTUNATELY

00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:23.943
THOUGH THAT ALSO BECOMES A

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.713
DISINCENTIVE --

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:29.349
PERHAPS. TWO PEOPLE ACTUALLY

00:02:29.415 --> 00:02:30.517
WANTING.

00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:31.150
TO ATTRACT MORE PEOPLE CHRONIC

00:02:31.217 --> 00:02:34.420
CONDITIONS AND ALSO IN PROVIDING

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:35.722
DEVELOPING --

00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:37.056
BETTER SYSTEMS CARE NOTHING IF

00:02:37.123 --> 00:02:38.725
PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO DO IT BUT

00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:40.593
WE DON'T HAVE THAT FINANCIAL

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.228
INCENTIVE.

00:02:42.295 --> 00:02:43.162
EDITION.

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:44.397
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE THE PLAN

00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:46.232
THAT'S BEST KNOWN AS TAKING CARE

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:46.733
OF A PARTICULAR CHRONIC

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:47.967
CONDITION ARE MENTAL HEALTH

00:02:48.034 --> 00:02:49.569
BECAUSE IF YOU TRACK MORE OF

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:51.070
THOSE PATIENTS THAT.

00:02:51.137 --> 00:02:53.106
AGAIN MIXES UP YOUR CASE MIX --

00:02:53.172 --> 00:02:54.407
SO THOSE ARE CERTAINLY SOME

00:02:54.474 --> 00:02:56.609
DISINCENTIVES THAT ARE POSSIBLY

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:58.177
THERE BUT THERE ARE DIFFERENT

00:02:58.244 --> 00:02:59.646
WAYS WE COULD TRY TO FIGURE OUT

00:02:59.712 --> 00:03:01.714
HOW WE CAN STRUCTURE THINGS.

00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:03.049
AND WE ALSO HAVE MODELS OUT

00:03:03.116 --> 00:03:04.551
THERE TO TAKE MORE COST

00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:09.022
EFFECIVE CARE SO I HOPE TODAY --

00:03:09.088 --> 00:03:09.556
WE HAVE AGREED TO SAID THE

00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:12.058
SPEAKERS WERE GOING LOOKING AT

00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:13.293
THE DATA --

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:14.227
AND THEY KNOW WE HAVE DOCTOR

00:03:14.294 --> 00:03:15.361
RIGHT OUT WHO'S GOING TO BE

00:03:15.428 --> 00:03:16.930
STARTING US OFF WITH THE THE

00:03:16.996 --> 00:03:17.697
CAN'T.

00:03:17.764 --> 00:03:19.365
HEALTHCARE QUALITY COST IT BUT

00:03:19.432 --> 00:03:20.767
WE'RE ALSO GOING TO HAVE --

00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:22.302
STRATEGIES A THAT'S GOING

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:24.070
PRESENTED BY COVERED CALIFORNIA

00:03:24.137 --> 00:03:26.039
CALPERS PACIFIC BUSINESS GROUP

00:03:26.105 --> 00:03:27.574
ON HEALTH REALLY LOOK AT MEDI

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.042
CAL BECAUSE MEDI CAL AND COVERS.

00:03:29.108 --> 00:03:30.810
A THIRD OF ALL CALIFORNIANS

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:31.511
ACTUALLY FOR ME IS A FEATURE

00:03:31.578 --> 00:03:33.313
SHOULD HALF OF ALL CHILDREN HAVE

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:36.115
ALL THE LIVERIS IS A CERTAINLY A

00:03:36.182 --> 00:03:36.449
LARGE PLAYER.

00:03:36.516 --> 00:03:37.584
IN.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.452
IN IN THIS SPACE AND THINKING

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:40.453
ABOUT HOW CAN WE BEND THE CURVE

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.821
AND BEND THE NEEDLE --

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:43.489
BECAUSE THAT ALSO SAY THAT IS A

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:45.091
POSITION MYSELF --

00:03:45.158 --> 00:03:46.759
THAT ON THE FRONT LINES IN THE

00:03:46.826 --> 00:03:48.795
FRONT LINES OF CARE OFTEN WHAT

00:03:48.861 --> 00:03:49.996
HAPPENS IS THAT --

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:51.764
NOW WE DO HAVE DIFFERENT PLANS

00:03:51.831 --> 00:03:54.601
AND ORGANIZATIONS TRYING TO

00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:57.170
PROVIDE DOWN THE INCENTIVES ARE

00:03:57.236 --> 00:03:58.938
THINGS TO YOUR P. FOR PETER THE

00:03:59.005 --> 00:04:01.774
TYPES OF THINGS --

00:04:01.841 --> 00:04:05.178
TERMINOLOGY AND ACRONYMS OF PAY

00:04:05.244 --> 00:04:07.080
FOR PERFORMANCE.

00:04:07.146 --> 00:04:09.415
TO THIRTY IS A CITY IN THE

00:04:09.482 --> 00:04:10.550
ACCIDENTS HERE BUT PAY FOR

00:04:10.617 --> 00:04:11.618
PERFORMANCE OTHER TYPES OF

00:04:11.684 --> 00:04:12.919
THINGS TO TRY TO GET YOU KNOW ME

00:04:12.986 --> 00:04:13.920
IN MY OFFICE TO DO THINGS BUT

YET.

00:04:14.387 --> 00:04:16.022
OFTEN THEY'RE NOT AT SCALE RIGHT

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:16.923
AND SO AM I GONNA CHANGE THE

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:20.526
WHOLE WAY MY OFFICE DOES

00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:22.996
SOMETHING BECAUSE A PLAN THAT

00:04:23.062 --> 00:04:26.132
PROVIDES CARE 220% MY PATIENTS.

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:26.933
AND THAT INCENTIVE ISN'T REALLY

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.568
GOING TO BE ENOUGH TO COVER THE

00:04:28.635 --> 00:04:29.702
COST OF THAT TRANSFORMATION

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:31.437
OFFICE TRANSFORMATIONS HOW DO WE

00:04:31.504 --> 00:04:33.539
GET THAT KIND OF TIPPING POINT

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:35.008
TO ISSUES THAT WE WANT TO LOOK

00:04:35.074 --> 00:04:37.276
AT AND THINK ABOUT AS WE MOVE

00:04:37.343 --> 00:04:38.611
FORWARD BUT CERTAINLY TODAY.

00:04:38.678 --> 00:04:39.545

00:06:14.006 --> 00:06:15.475
AND WE HAVE A COLLECTION OF VERY

00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:17.443
STRANGE BEDFELLOWS HEALTH PLANS

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.879
A PROVIDER GROUPS HEALTH SYSTEMS --

00:06:19.946 --> 00:06:20.513
WE HAVE --

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.248
CONSUMER GROUPS WE HAVE

00:06:22.315 --> 00:06:23.716
PURCHASERS ALL AT THE TABLE I

00:06:23.783 --> 00:06:25.384
WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

00:06:25.451 --> 00:06:26.786
TO THE THREE PANELISTS IT WILL

00:06:26.853 --> 00:06:28.254
FOLLOW ME OUR MEMBERS BY JAY IS

00:06:28.321 --> 00:06:29.021
WHERE MEMBERS.

00:06:29.088 --> 00:06:31.357
WE DON'T ACCEPT IT ASSOCIATIONS --

00:06:31.424 --> 00:06:33.059
BY OUR BYLAWS SO --

00:06:33.126 --> 00:06:34.260
BUT WE DO DO A LOT OF WORK WITH

00:06:34.327 --> 00:06:36.195
PPG AGE AND WE DO GET A LOT OF

00:06:36.262 --> 00:06:38.264
SUPPORT FROM THE CALIFORNIA

00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:40.733
HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.501
THERE ARE TWO PROGRAMS AT A LIKE

00:06:41.567 --> 00:06:42.268
TO HIGHLIGHT COUNTLESS IS ONE OF

00:06:42.335 --> 00:06:43.703
THEM BUT THIS IS THE NEXT STEP

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.905
AFTER A LONG STANDING PROGRAM

00:06:45.972 --> 00:06:47.140
CALLED CAMP --

00:06:47.206 --> 00:06:49.442
DETAILS HERE THAT ARE IMPORTANT

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:50.877
AMP ACTUALLY IS A P. FOR P.

00:06:50.943 --> 00:06:52.211
PROGRAM IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR

00:06:52.278 --> 00:06:54.046
OVER TWENTY YEARS IT'S THE

00:06:54.113 --> 00:06:55.348
LARGEST ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT

00:06:55.414 --> 00:06:56.449
MODEL N THE COUNTRY AND

00:06:56.516 --> 00:06:58.618
SUPPORTS ABOUT NINE MILLION

00:06:58.684 --> 00:06:59.585
COMMERCIAL HMO MEMBERS.

00:06:59.652 --> 00:07:01.454
IT'S UNIT OF MEASUREMENT IS THE

00:07:01.521 --> 00:07:03.089
PROVIDER GROUP SOON IPA OR

00:07:03.156 --> 00:07:04.056
MEDICAL GROUP IS THE PRIMARY

00:07:04.123 --> 00:07:05.591
UNIT OF ANALYSIS.

00:07:05.658 --> 00:07:07.794
INFORMATION FROM CAMP HAS BEEN

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.028
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE THROUGH THE

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:11.097
PA FOR MULTIPLE YEARS AND IT

00:07:11.164 --> 00:07:12.532
MEASURES QUALITY PATIENT

00:07:12.598 --> 00:07:13.432
EXPERIENCE WHICH I KNOW IS

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:14.534
IMPORTANT THIS COMMITTEE --

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.235
AND ALSO TOTAL COST OF CARE AND

00:07:16.302 --> 00:07:17.537
THAT'S GOING TO BE A THEME

00:07:17.603 --> 00:07:18.671
THROUGHOUT THIS TOTAL COST OF

00:07:18.738 --> 00:07:20.640
CARE INCLUDING PATIENT COST

00:07:20.706 --> 00:07:21.541
SHARING IS A BIG PART OF THE

00:07:21.607 --> 00:07:23.176
MEASUREMENT WE'VE BEEN DOING FOR

00:07:23.242 --> 00:07:24.143
ABOUT EIGHT YEARS.

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.113
THE ATLAS PROGRAM IS NEWER WERE

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:30.516
IN OUR COUPLE OF WEEKS THIS

00:07:30.583 --> 00:07:31.450
STARTED --

00:07:31.517 --> 00:07:33.419
ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO FUNDING FOR

00:07:33.486 --> 00:07:34.620
THIS CAME FROM THE CALIFORNIA

00:07:34.687 --> 00:07:36.022
HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION FUNDING

00:07:36.088 --> 00:07:37.790
FOR THE AMP PROGRAM IS LARGELY

00:07:37.857 --> 00:07:38.858
THROUGH THE PLAN PARTICIPANTS.

00:07:38.925 --> 00:07:41.627
WHO SUBMIT DATA?

00:07:41.694 --> 00:07:42.295
POURTANT TO NOTE THAT THE

00:07:42.361 --> 00:07:44.197
HAPLESS PROGRAM INCLUDES OVER

00:07:44.263 --> 00:07:45.398
TWENTY NINE MILLION.

00:07:45.464 --> 00:07:46.666
INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA SO

00:07:46.732 --> 00:07:48.234
IT'S BY FAR ONE THE LARGEST SUCH

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:50.002
PROGRAMS IN THE COUNTRY IT ALSO

00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:51.537
INCLUDES MEDICARE DATA.

00:07:51.604 --> 00:07:53.606
ON COMMERCIAL HMO DATA AND HAS

00:07:53.673 --> 00:07:54.874
INFORMATION AVAILABLE BY

00:07:54.941 --> 00:07:57.343
DIFFERENT PRODUCT LINES LIKE A A

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:58.778
SO OR SELF FUNDED PROGRAMS.

00:07:58.845 --> 00:07:59.579
THE REALLY IMPORTANT THING FROM

00:07:59.645 --> 00:08:00.913
A TECHNICAL POINT OF VIEW IS

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:02.782
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WE

00:08:02.849 --> 00:08:04.350
PUT THIS ON A SINGLE PLATFORM.

00:08:04.417 --> 00:08:06.285
SO THESE ARE SEPARATE PROGRAMS

00:08:06.352 --> 00:08:08.087
AT ALL DROP FROM THE SAME DATA

00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:09.455
THE SAME FOR MATCH THE SAME

00:08:09.522 --> 00:08:10.923
MEASURES SO EVERYTHING IS

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:11.791
STANDARDIZED AND THAT'S BEEN A

00:08:11.858 --> 00:08:13.593
HUGE LIFT IT'S KIND OF A BEHIND

00:08:13.659 --> 00:08:14.327
THE SCENES LEFT.

00:08:14.393 --> 00:08:15.661
BUT IT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU NEED

00:08:15.728 --> 00:08:17.063
IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO ANY SORT

00:08:17.129 --> 00:08:18.531
OF COMPARISONS THAT HAVE MEANING

00:08:18.598 --> 00:08:21.234
ACROSS PLANS AND PROVIDERS AND

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:22.635
PROVIDER --

00:08:22.702 --> 00:08:24.103
PROVIDER SYSTEMS.

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.972
KEY TAKE AWAYS SO THIS IS --

00:08:26.038 --> 00:08:27.006
REALLY.

00:08:27.073 --> 00:08:28.074
KIND OF THE THE PUNCHLINE I'LL

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:29.108
GIVE YOU SOME ANALYSIS IF YOU'D

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:30.109
LIKE AFTER THIS --

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:31.377
THERE'S WIDE VARIATION IN

00:08:31.444 --> 00:08:32.478
QUALITY AND COST THROUGHOUT

00:08:32.545 --> 00:08:33.913
CALIFORNIA IT'S PERSISTENT

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:35.848
OVERTIME IT'S PERSISTENT OVER

00:08:35.915 --> 00:08:37.283
PRODUCT LINES --

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:38.484
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND URBAN

00:08:38.551 --> 00:08:39.819
AREAS TEND TO BE HIGHER ON

00:08:39.886 --> 00:08:41.254
QUALITY BUT THE CABBIE OUT THERE

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.154
IS.

00:08:42.221 --> 00:08:43.890
NOT ALWAYS AND THERE'S A WIDE

00:08:43.956 --> 00:08:44.891
VARIATION NO MATTER WHAT YOU

00:08:44.957 --> 00:08:46.259
MEASURE NO MATTER WHERE YOU

00:08:46.325 --> 00:08:47.126
MEASURE QUALITY.

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:48.628
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY

00:08:48.694 --> 00:08:50.229
DOES BETTER ON TOTAL COST OF

00:08:50.296 --> 00:08:52.531
CARE IN GENERAL I THINK WE

00:08:52.598 --> 00:08:53.966
UNDERSTAND SOME OF THOSE TRENDS --

00:08:54.033 --> 00:08:55.568
THE DATA IN THE ATLAS ACTUALLY

00:08:55.635 --> 00:08:58.604
SUPPORTS PRECISE ANALYSIS

00:08:58.671 --> 00:08:59.972
SOMEWHAT THAT MEANS.

00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:01.274
THERE'S LESS VARIATION IN MEDIC

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:02.541
COW BUT ONE OF OUR CHALLENGES

00:09:02.608 --> 00:09:03.476
THAT I'D LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH

00:09:03.542 --> 00:09:04.944
HERE TODAY IS THE DATA THAT WE

00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:06.479
HAVE FOR MEDI CAL IS MORE

00:09:06.545 --> 00:09:06.979
LIMITED.

00:09:07.046 --> 00:09:08.814
AND SO WE CAN DO SOME ANALYSIS

00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:10.449
BUT IT IS NOT AS ROBUST OR AS

00:09:10.516 --> 00:09:11.550
COMPLETE AS IT IS ON THE

00:09:11.617 --> 00:09:13.085
COMMERCIAL MEDICARE SIDE SO SOME

00:09:13.152 --> 00:09:14.553
OF WHAT WE CAN DO.

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:15.321
ON THE COMMERCIAL AND MEDICARE

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:18.157
SIDE WE CAN'T AT THIS POINT DO

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:19.492
ON THE MEDICAL SIDE.

00:09:19.558 --> 00:09:20.793
HEALTH PLAN PRODUCTS THAT USE

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.728
INTEGRATED NETWORKS --

00:09:22.795 --> 00:09:24.463
THOSE ARE MEDICAL GROUPS AND I.

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:25.698
P. A.'S ATTENDED AND TAKE

00:09:25.765 --> 00:09:26.766
FINANCIAL RISK ACTUALLY SO

00:09:26.832 --> 00:09:28.301
SUPERIOR COST AND QUALITY

00:09:28.367 --> 00:09:29.402
PROFILES.

00:09:29.468 --> 00:09:30.870
RELATIVE TO NON INTEGRATED

00:09:30.937 --> 00:09:32.738
NETWORKS AND THAT INCLUDES AGAIN

00:09:32.805 --> 00:09:34.273
THE PATIENT CARSHARING COMPONENT

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:35.741
OF THAT --

00:09:35.808 --> 00:09:37.476
AND FINANCIAL REASSURING IN THE

00:09:37.543 --> 00:09:38.377
FORM OF CAPITATION GIN TRYING

00:09:38.444 --> 00:09:40.179
NOT TO GET TOO TECHNICAL ABOUT

00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:41.614
THIS BUT THAT SEEMS TO HAVE A

00:09:41.681 --> 00:09:43.549
DIRECT CORRELATION. TO OVERALL

00:09:43.616 --> 00:09:45.318
QUALITY AND TOTAL COST OF CARE

00:09:45.384 --> 00:09:47.620
PERFORMANCE SO IN SIMPLE TERMS

00:09:47.687 --> 00:09:50.323
THE MORE RISK AN ORGANIZATION

00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:52.358
TAKES.

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:54.026
EE AND AND COMFORTABLY THE

00:09:54.093 --> 00:09:54.660
BETTER THEY SEEM TO DO ON BOTH

00:09:54.727 --> 00:09:57.096
QUALITY AND COST.

00:09:57.163 --> 00:09:58.097
OF NOTE ACCOUNTABLE CARE

00:09:58.164 --> 00:09:59.999
ORGANIZATIONS WHICH YOU I'M SURE

00:10:00.066 --> 00:10:01.767
OF HEARD OF IN OUR ANALYSIS THEY

00:10:01.834 --> 00:10:03.536
PERFORM BETTER TAN NETWORKS

00:10:03.602 --> 00:10:04.570
THAT ARE NOT INTEGRATED BUT THEY

00:10:04.637 --> 00:10:06.272
DON'T PERFORM BETTER THAN THE

00:10:06.339 --> 00:10:07.340
INTEGRATED NETWORKS THAT HAVE

00:10:07.406 --> 00:10:09.575
EXISTED FOR FIFTEEN OR TWENTY

00:10:09.642 --> 00:10:11.344
YEARS SO THERE'S VARIATION --

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:12.611
AND AGAIN THE LACK OF MEDICAL

00:10:12.678 --> 00:10:13.512
DATA T THIS POINT IN ARE

00:10:13.579 --> 00:10:15.247
PROCESS SEEMS TO LIMIT SOME OF

00:10:15.314 --> 00:10:16.482
THE THINGS THAT MIGHT BE MOST

00:10:16.549 --> 00:10:17.616
INTERESTING GIVEN THE GROWTH IN

00:10:17.683 --> 00:10:18.884
MEDICARE MEMBERSHIP [inaudible]

00:10:18.951 --> 00:10:22.888
YEAH.

00:10:22.955 --> 00:10:27.927
THERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:10:27.994 --> 00:10:30.763
CALIFORNIA'S ROLLED IN THE

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:31.731
MEDICAL PROGRAMS LIKE FOR

00:10:31.797 --> 00:10:33.366
MISSING A VERY IMPORTANT

00:10:33.432 --> 00:10:36.969
COMPONENT TO IT TO DATA FOR US

00:10:37.036 --> 00:10:39.005
YES START ARE UP TO YOU --

00:10:39.071 --> 00:10:40.639
I THINK THE THE BEST ANSWER IS

00:10:40.706 --> 00:10:42.008
THIS WHOLE PROGRAM IS VOLUNTARY

00:10:42.074 --> 00:10:43.142
IT'S WHAT'S CALLED A VOLUNTARY

00:10:43.209 --> 00:10:44.543
MULTI PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE.

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:45.745
SO WE GET THIS INFORMATION FROM

00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:46.946
THE HEALTH PLANS BASED ON THEIR

00:10:47.013 --> 00:10:47.613
WILLINGNESS TO GIVE IT TO US --

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.615
AT THIS POINT MEDI CAL HAS BEEN --

00:10:49.682 --> 00:10:51.350
NOT AS WILLING ORGANIZATIONALLY

00:10:51.417 --> 00:10:52.118
AND I I WOULD SAY A COUPLE

00:10:52.184 --> 00:10:52.852
CABBIE ODDS WE DO GET MEDI CAL

00:10:52.918 --> 00:10:54.420
DATA FROM ONE HEALTH PLAN

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:58.424
PROMISE HEALTH PLAN --

00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:01.627
WE HAVE AS MANY OTHER GENERALLY

00:11:01.694 --> 00:11:03.029
THEY BE WILLING TO DO THAT THE

00:11:03.095 --> 00:11:04.530
CHALLENGES BECAUSE OF THE CAR

00:11:04.597 --> 00:11:05.331
ABOUT NATURE OF MANY OF THE

00:11:05.398 --> 00:11:07.266
PLANS THAT DATA FROM THE SOURCE

00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:08.601
IS NOT IS COMPARABLE SO IT'S

00:11:08.667 --> 00:11:09.668
ACTUALLY EASIER TO GET IT

00:11:09.735 --> 00:11:10.503
DIRECTLY.

00:11:10.569 --> 00:11:12.438
FROM DH CS SO UP TO THIS POINT

00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:14.306
WE'VE GOTTEN INFORMATION AND

00:11:14.373 --> 00:11:16.175
PERFORMANCE FROM DH CS WE

00:11:16.242 --> 00:11:17.710
HAVEN'T GONE THE DATE ITSELF.

00:11:17.777 --> 00:11:18.277
AND THAT'S BEEN A FRIENDLY

00:11:18.344 --> 00:11:19.845
DIALOGUE BUT IT'S JUST IT'S A

00:11:19.912 --> 00:11:21.514
PROCESS AND I WOULD JUST POINT

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:22.581
OUT THOUGH WE WILL BE HEARING

00:11:22.648 --> 00:11:26.786
FROM DHS TOWARD THE END OF MY

00:11:26.852 --> 00:11:29.989
ALASKAN THAT --

00:11:30.056 --> 00:11:31.957
TO I WENT OVER ONE YOU WITH THE

00:11:32.024 --> 00:11:32.591
ANALYSIS I GUESS WHAT I WOULD.

00:11:32.658 --> 00:11:34.126
LEAVE YOU WITH IS THAT WHATEVER

00:11:34.193 --> 00:11:35.561
I SHOW YOU IS A FORM OF A USE

00:11:35.628 --> 00:11:36.695
CASE OF WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH

00:11:36.762 --> 00:11:38.364
THIS INFRASTRUCTURE THERE ONLY.

00:11:38.431 --> 00:11:39.265
LIMITED TO THE TOPIC THAT WE'RE

00:11:39.331 --> 00:11:40.266
TALKING ABOUT.

00:11:40.332 --> 00:11:41.834
THIS IS MEASURING CHRONIC CARE

00:11:41.901 --> 00:11:43.269
PERFORMANCE AND THE TAKE AWAYS

00:11:43.335 --> 00:11:45.504
HERE RATES ARE GENERALLY LOWER

00:11:45.571 --> 00:11:47.239
THAN YOU'D WANT IN THE VARIATION

00:11:47.306 --> 00:11:48.774
IS QUITE HIGH SO --

00:11:48.841 --> 00:11:50.776
AVERAGES HIDE A LOT OF TRUTH

00:11:50.843 --> 00:11:51.377
THAT EVERYBODY NEEDS TO

00:11:51.444 --> 00:11:53.045
UNDERSTAND SO IF YOU LOOK AT

00:11:53.112 --> 00:11:54.814
THESE RATES ARE YOU CAN SEE THAT

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.015
SOME OF THE DIABETES MEASURES

00:11:56.082 --> 00:11:58.284
ARE ACTUALLY IN THE 50% RANGE ON

00:11:58.350 --> 00:11:58.851
AVERAGE.

00:11:58.918 --> 00:12:00.719
OR IF YOU LOOK AT THE VARIATION --

00:12:00.786 --> 00:12:02.221
PRETTY WIDE VARIATION AND THIS

00:12:02.288 --> 00:12:03.923
EXISTS WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:12:03.989 --> 00:12:06.358
GEOGRAPHIES OR DIFFERENT HMO PPO

00:12:06.425 --> 00:12:08.260
OR RISK SHARING ARRANGEMENTS --

00:12:08.327 --> 00:12:09.862
I PUT A FEW THE COUNTIES THAT

00:12:09.929 --> 00:12:11.464
PERFORM WELL ON THAT JUST TO

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:12.865
SHOW YOU THAT THERE IS A TREND

00:12:12.932 --> 00:12:14.100
TOWARD NORTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT

00:12:14.166 --> 00:12:16.202
NOT ALWAYS AND AGAIN WITHIN ANY

00:12:16.268 --> 00:12:19.905
COUNTY THERE ARE HIGH PERFORMERS

00:12:19.972 --> 00:12:21.740
AND LOW PERFORMERS --

00:12:21.807 --> 00:12:22.975
COST THIS IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT

00:12:23.042 --> 00:12:24.743
ANALYSIS TO SHARE TOTAL COSTS TO

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:26.178
CARE AGAIN INCLUDES --

00:12:26.245 --> 00:12:27.746
CLINICAL RISK ADJUSTMENT SO NOT

00:12:27.813 --> 00:12:28.380
TO GET TOO WALKING ABOUT IT BUT

00:12:28.447 --> 00:12:29.715
THIS ACCOUNT FOR DIFFERENCES IN

00:12:29.782 --> 00:12:30.683
PATIENT POPULATIONS AND DISEASE

00:12:30.749 --> 00:12:31.684
SEVERITY.

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:32.885
IT ALSO INCLUDES WAGE

00:12:32.952 --> 00:12:34.320
ADJUSTMENTS SO WE ARE JUST SEEN

00:12:34.386 --> 00:12:36.055
AS BEST WE CAN FOR WHICH THE

00:12:36.122 --> 00:12:37.189
DIFFERENTIALS IN NORTHERN AND

00:12:37.256 --> 00:12:39.492
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA --

00:12:39.558 --> 00:12:42.228
PRETTY OBVIOUS TREND IN NORTHERN

00:12:42.294 --> 00:12:43.729
ON A COMPARATIVE BASIS --

00:12:43.796 --> 00:12:45.564
ALSO MUCH MORE VARIATION IN

00:12:45.631 --> 00:12:46.465
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THEN IN

00:12:46.532 --> 00:12:48.501
SOUTHERN AND THERE'S LOTS OF

00:12:48.567 --> 00:12:49.902
CONJECTURE ABOUT THIS.

00:12:49.969 --> 00:12:51.904
US IN THE CALIFORNIA TENDS TO BE

00:12:51.971 --> 00:12:53.706
BY MOST METRICS MORE COMPETITIVE

00:12:53.772 --> 00:12:55.741
MARKET --

00:12:55.808 --> 00:12:56.375
THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IN SOME

00:12:56.442 --> 00:12:59.011
WAYS -- THE

00:12:59.078 --> 00:13:00.746
DELIVERY MODEL MATTERS HERE I'M

00:13:00.813 --> 00:13:01.614
GONNA SHOW YOU HOW INTEGRATED

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.716
CARE PERFORMS RELATIVE TO NON

00:13:03.782 --> 00:13:05.317
INTEGRATED CARE --

00:13:05.384 --> 00:13:07.086
THIS GIVES YOU A SENSE OF THE

00:13:07.153 --> 00:13:08.454
POWER OF THE COMBINED DATABASE

00:13:08.521 --> 00:13:09.889
EACH OF THOSE DOT IS A DIFFERENT

00:13:09.955 --> 00:13:11.257
HEIGHT PA MEDICAL GROUP IN THE

00:13:11.323 --> 00:13:12.992
STATE THERE ALMOST TWO HUNDRED

00:13:13.058 --> 00:13:14.026
REPRESENTED.

00:13:14.093 --> 00:13:14.994
AND THE AVERAGE FOR INTEGRATED

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:16.762
CARE ON A DIABETES COMPOSITE IS

00:13:16.829 --> 00:13:19.131
ABOUT 55% THAT'S FIVE TO SIX

00:13:19.198 --> 00:13:20.199
MEASURES WHERE YOU HAVE TO BE

00:13:20.266 --> 00:13:21.333
GOOD ON ALL OF THEM TO GET

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.535
CREDIT SO.

00:13:22.601 --> 00:13:23.736
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY BAD IT'S

00:13:23.802 --> 00:13:25.604
NOT NECESSARILY GOOD WHEN YOU

00:13:25.671 --> 00:13:27.273
LOOK AT THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE

00:13:27.339 --> 00:13:29.041
HOWEVER TAXES LOWER SO WHAT WE

00:13:29.108 --> 00:13:30.376
SEE IS WHEN YOU START TO COMBINE

00:13:30.442 --> 00:13:32.178
INTEGRATED AND NON INTEGRATED

00:13:32.244 --> 00:13:33.679
DELIVERY SYSTEMS THINGS GET.

00:13:33.746 --> 00:13:35.748
WORSE THIS INCLUDES THE

00:13:35.814 --> 00:13:37.583
INTEGRATED SYSTEMS --

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:38.617
THE HIGHEST REGIONAL AVERAGE IS

00:13:38.684 --> 00:13:40.586
ABOUT THE SAME AS THE INTEGRATED

00:13:40.653 --> 00:13:41.220
AVERAGE AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE

00:13:41.287 --> 00:13:41.887
TOP.

00:13:41.954 --> 00:13:43.689
QUARTILE OF THE INTEGRATED

00:13:43.756 --> 00:13:44.957
GROUPS IT'S MUCH HIGHER WITH

00:13:45.024 --> 00:13:46.759
THIS TRANSLATES TO IN TERMS OF

00:13:46.825 --> 00:13:49.495
ACTUALLY PATIENT CARE IS ABOUT

00:13:49.562 --> 00:13:50.229
EIGHTY THOUSAND MORE DIABETICS

00:13:50.296 --> 00:13:51.730
GETTING BETTER AND MORE

00:13:51.797 --> 00:13:52.932
APPROPRIATE SCREENING.

00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:55.234
THEN IN INTEGRATED CARE THEN AND

00:13:55.301 --> 00:13:58.037
NON INTEGRATED CARE AND TIME

00:13:58.103 --> 00:14:00.105
SECRETARY WHO STILL OKAY.

00:14:00.172 --> 00:14:00.806
OKAY -- A

00:14:00.873 --> 00:14:01.807
FEW THINGS TO SAY WHEN WE

00:14:01.874 --> 00:14:03.342
STANDARDIZE ALL THE MEASURES AND

00:14:03.409 --> 00:14:05.544
COMPARE HMO PPO.

00:14:05.611 --> 00:14:07.012
HMO IS ACTUALLY CHEAPER IN TOTAL

00:14:07.079 --> 00:14:09.448
COST OF CARE A LESS EXPENSIVE

00:14:09.515 --> 00:14:10.349
SHOULDN'T USE WERE CHEAPER.

00:14:10.416 --> 00:14:12.284
OF MOST OF THAT IS DUE TO THE

00:14:12.351 --> 00:14:15.187
MEMBER COST SHARING AND IN OUR

00:14:15.254 --> 00:14:16.655
IN OUR MINDS THIS IS THE ACTUAL

00:14:16.722 --> 00:14:18.023
NUMBERS TO GO WITH IT.

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:19.225
IF YOU LOOK AT THOSE NUMBERS FOR

00:14:19.291 --> 00:14:20.960
PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS

00:14:21.026 --> 00:14:23.262
IT'S TWO TO THREE TIMES HIGHER.

00:14:23.329 --> 00:14:24.230
A TWO THREE HIGHER TIMES HIGHER

00:14:24.296 --> 00:14:25.798
THAN THE ACTUAL NUMBER SO WE'RE

00:14:25.864 --> 00:14:27.066
TALKING ABOUT NOW THOUSANDS OF

00:14:27.132 --> 00:14:28.367
DOLLARS FOR PATIENTS WITH

00:14:28.434 --> 00:14:29.835
CHRONIC DISEASE IN TERMS OF COST

00:14:29.902 --> 00:14:31.136
SHARING SO MOST OF THE A

00:14:31.203 --> 00:14:35.841
PRESUMED ADVANTAGE OF SHARON

00:14:35.908 --> 00:14:38.310
SEEMS TO SHIFT TO THE PATIENTS.

00:14:38.377 --> 00:14:39.612
LAST THING I'M GOING TO SHARE IN

00:14:39.678 --> 00:14:40.446
THE NONSTOP --

00:14:40.512 --> 00:14:41.447
WE TOOK ANOTHER LOOK AT THIS

00:14:41.513 --> 00:14:42.448
AGAIN THE PLANS ARE REALLY

00:14:42.514 --> 00:14:43.949
REALLY SUPPORTIVE OF PROVIDING

00:14:44.016 --> 00:14:45.684
THE DATA AND ACTUALLY PAYING FOR

00:14:45.751 --> 00:14:46.885
A LOT OF THIS INFRASTRUCTURE WE

00:14:46.952 --> 00:14:48.487
ARE VERY APPRECIATIVE.

00:14:48.554 --> 00:14:50.022
SO IT'S NOT SO MUCH ABOUT THE

00:14:50.089 --> 00:14:51.690
PRODUCT LABEL HMO PPO TRULY

00:14:51.757 --> 00:14:53.359
WHAT'S UNDERNEATH THE CHASSIS.

00:14:53.425 --> 00:14:54.994
SO WE LOOKED AT ACTUALLY --

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:56.428
WHAT TYPES OF NETWORKS ARE

00:14:56.495 --> 00:14:58.464
PROVIDING UNDER THESE PRODUCT --

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:02.534
PLANS SO WE WERE ABLE TO LOOK AT

00:15:02.601 --> 00:15:03.936
WHETHER --

00:15:04.003 --> 00:15:04.570
THE ENROLLEES ARE ACTUALLY IN

00:15:04.637 --> 00:15:05.638
RISK SITUATIONS CAPITATED

00:15:05.704 --> 00:15:06.639
SITUATIONS OR NOT.

00:15:06.705 --> 00:15:08.274
SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT ACTUALLY NO

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:09.942
RISK WHICH TEND TO BE MORE PPO

00:15:10.009 --> 00:15:10.776
BUT NOT ALWAYS.

00:15:10.843 --> 00:15:13.012
THAT'S A COMPOSITE OF THEIR

00:15:13.078 --> 00:15:14.780
QUALITY GOING.

00:15:14.847 --> 00:15:16.382
FROM BOTTOM TO TOP GETS HIGHER

00:15:16.448 --> 00:15:17.583
WHEN YOU TAKE ON MORE RISK AND

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:18.784
GETS EVEN A LITTLE HIGHER WHEN

00:15:18.851 --> 00:15:20.286
YOU TAKE ON COMPLETE RISKS OF

00:15:20.352 --> 00:15:22.421
THE FULL BUDGET. FOR OUTPATIENT

00:15:22.488 --> 00:15:24.256
AND INPATIENT CARE COST GO THE

00:15:24.323 --> 00:15:26.191
OPPOSITE DIRECTION --

00:15:26.258 --> 00:15:27.660
SO -- WHAT

00:15:27.726 --> 00:15:30.262
WE HOPE WITH THIS ANALYSIS WE

00:15:30.329 --> 00:15:32.064
CAN SPLIT A BY PRODUCT LINE IS

00:15:32.131 --> 00:15:33.499
LET'S LOOK AT SORT OF THAT THE

00:15:33.565 --> 00:15:34.533
CHARACTERISTICS?

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.702
OF A OF A PRODUCT THAT PEOPLE

00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:37.636
ARE BEING ASKED TO PURCHASER

00:15:37.703 --> 00:15:39.305
BEING OFFERED --

00:15:39.371 --> 00:15:40.906
AND WHAT DRIVES --

00:15:40.973 --> 00:15:41.974
HIGHER VALUE CARE.

00:15:42.041 --> 00:15:42.908
TIE WILL STOP THERE THE LAST

00:15:42.975 --> 00:15:45.010
THING.

00:15:45.077 --> 00:15:46.412
POR STOP THIS ACTUALLY LOOKS AT

00:15:46.478 --> 00:15:48.013
THE NUMBER OF MEASURES.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.616
THAT WE NOW CAN CALCULATE THESE

00:15:50.683 --> 00:15:52.017
OF THE MEDI CAL VERSUS

00:15:52.084 --> 00:15:53.819
COMMERCIAL VERSUS MEDICARE AS

00:15:53.886 --> 00:15:55.287
YOU CAN SEE THERE'S BEEN A REAL.

00:15:55.354 --> 00:15:57.222
NICE TRAINED UP FOR BOTH

00:15:57.289 --> 00:15:59.124
MEDICARE AND COMMERCIAL DATA WE

00:15:59.191 --> 00:16:01.126
HAVE NOT SEEN THAT SAME GROWTH

00:16:01.193 --> 00:16:02.127
IN THE MEDI CAL.

00:16:02.194 --> 00:16:04.330
INFORMATION PARTLY BECAUSE WE'RE

00:16:04.396 --> 00:16:07.132
NOT CALCULATING THOSE RATES WE A

00:16:07.199 --> 00:16:08.901
SUBJECT TO WHAT THE H. YES WOULD

00:16:08.967 --> 00:16:10.569
LIKE TO DO WITH US.

00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:12.738
SO I WILL.

00:16:12.805 --> 00:16:14.707
STOP THEIR FEW THINGS FOR

00:16:14.773 --> 00:16:15.407
ACTIONS WHICH COME OUT OF OUR

00:16:15.474 --> 00:16:18.477
WORK [inaudible] TO THANK YOU

00:16:18.544 --> 00:16:20.846
VERY MUCH ALRIGHT QUESTIONS

00:16:20.913 --> 00:16:23.148
REMEMBERS YES CENTER LEYVA.

00:16:23.215 --> 00:16:24.483
THINK MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU THE

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:25.451

INFORMATIVE --

00:16:26.618 --> 00:16:28.687
PRESENTATION HAVE TWO QUESTIONS.

00:16:28.754 --> 00:16:30.522
HMO AND PPO COSTS AND THE PPO

00:16:30.589 --> 00:16:33.359
COSTS ARE HIGHER TO THE THE

00:16:33.425 --> 00:16:34.960
MEMBER THE THE PERSON WHO'S

00:16:35.027 --> 00:16:35.928
PAYING THAT.

00:16:35.994 --> 00:16:38.197
DO YOU THINK THAT IS BECAUSE I

00:16:38.263 --> 00:16:39.932
AM SOMEONE WHO'S HAD AN HMO AND

00:16:39.998 --> 00:16:41.400
AND HAVE HAD A PPO FOR A LONG

00:16:41.467 --> 00:16:42.368
TIME.

00:16:42.434 --> 00:16:44.536
DO YOU THINK THAT IS BECAUSE THE

00:16:44.603 --> 00:16:47.172
HMO THOSE KIND OF CONTROL.

00:16:47.239 --> 00:16:49.274
WHERE YOU CAN GO WHEN YOU CAN GO

00:16:49.341 --> 00:16:53.645
TO THE DOG WITH THE PPO I CAN I

00:16:53.712 --> 00:16:55.514

I WANT AND ITS EASE EGGS CALL

00:16:57.015 --> 00:16:58.283
MAKE THE APPOINTMENT VERSUS

00:16:58.350 --> 00:16:59.284
HAVING TO HAVE A REFERRAL DO

00:16:59.351 --> 00:17:00.519
THINK THAT HAS ANYTHING TO DO

00:17:00.586 --> 00:17:01.887
WITH THE COSTS --

00:17:01.954 --> 00:17:03.489
THAT NO DOUBT OCCURS I WILL --

00:17:03.555 --> 00:17:04.656
CAUTION EVERYBODY ON THE

00:17:04.723 --> 00:17:05.824
COMMITTEE THIS IS OBSERVATIONAL

00:17:05.891 --> 00:17:07.126
DATA AND THIS IS WHAT WE SEE

00:17:07.192 --> 00:17:08.660
WHAT IS DRIVING THOSE

00:17:08.727 --> 00:17:10.596
DIFFERENCES IS REALLY FOR

00:17:10.662 --> 00:17:12.264
POLICYMAKERS AND OTHERS --

00:17:12.331 --> 00:17:14.166
TO TO ASK AND ANSWER I THINK

00:17:14.233 --> 00:17:16.435
FROM WHAT WE SEE IN THE DATA.

00:17:16.502 --> 00:17:19.171
IS LARGELY BASED ON THE COST OF

00:17:19.238 --> 00:17:20.606
DELIVERING THE CARE FOR ANY

00:17:20.672 --> 00:17:22.741
MATCH POPULATION AND WHO'S

00:17:22.808 --> 00:17:24.576
PAYING PART OF THAT SO.

00:17:24.643 --> 00:17:25.944
IN AN HMO THE CAUTION IS MUCH

00:17:26.011 --> 00:17:27.946
LOWER THE COPAYS AND DEDUCTIBLES

00:17:28.013 --> 00:17:29.415
BY DESIGN MEDI CAL THEIR THEIR

00:17:29.481 --> 00:17:31.116
NEXT TO NOTHING SO IF YOU USE

00:17:31.183 --> 00:17:33.285
THE ACTUARIAL TERM THE ACTUARIAL

00:17:33.352 --> 00:17:36.155
VALUE IS HIGHER IN AN HMO --

00:17:36.221 --> 00:17:37.523
WHERE IS IN A PPO MORE THAT IS

00:17:37.589 --> 00:17:40.492
SHIFTED AND THE PEOPLE THAT THEN

00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:42.628
IN KERR THOSE COSTS FOR THE ONES

00:17:42.694 --> 00:17:43.896
THAT YOU SERVICES?

00:17:43.962 --> 00:17:44.329
GOT IT.

00:17:44.396 --> 00:17:44.963
THANK YOU.

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:45.831
CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHEN YOU SAID

00:17:45.898 --> 00:17:50.102
FINANCIAL RISK SHARING WHAT IS

00:17:50.169 --> 00:17:53.405
THAT -- IN

00:17:53.472 --> 00:17:54.506
COMMON TERMS IT'S CAPITATION

00:17:54.573 --> 00:17:57.543
OKAY -- OR

00:17:57.609 --> 00:17:59.044
BUDGETED SO BASICALLY PEOPLE

00:17:59.111 --> 00:18:00.112
TAKING A SET AMOUNT OF MONEY TO

00:18:00.179 --> 00:18:00.579
TAKE CARE OF AN ENTIRE

00:18:00.646 --> 00:18:02.014
POPULATION REGARDLESS OF WHETHER

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:04.216
THAT POPULATION IS.

CHANGES ACROSS MULTIPLE CHRONIC

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:56.962
DISEASES A LOT OF TIMES YOU'RE

00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:58.797
DOING YOUR YOU'RE CREATING

00:19:58.864 --> 00:19:59.398
PROCESS IS THAT THEY ACTUALLY

AT LET AND ALSO THE EXISTING

00:20:07.239 --> 00:20:10.742
MODELS THAT WOULD INDICATE WHICH

00:20:10.809 --> 00:20:14.313
WAY IS THE BETTER WAY TO GO.

00:20:14.379 --> 00:20:15.414
SOMETHING CO A SORRY ACCOUNTABLE

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.683
CARE ORGANIZATION SO THAT YEAH

IT IS AS SAYING THAT THE

00:20:19.318 --> 00:20:21.019
COUNTABLE CARE ORGANIZATION DIED

00:20:21.086 --> 00:20:22.588
CONCEPT IS IS THAT'S A SURE SO

00:20:22.654 --> 00:20:23.188
WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT YOU WOULD

00:20:23.255 --> 00:20:25.457
GIVE A FIX THE ACE SOMEWHAT

00:20:25.524 --> 00:20:27.392
FIXED AMOUNT FOR CARING FOR

00:20:27.459 --> 00:20:27.926
PATIENTS AS A PARTICULAR

00:20:27.993 --> 00:20:28.961
CONDITION.

00:20:29.027 --> 00:20:30.696
RIGHT AND THEY'RE FOR DIRTY SO

00:20:30.762 --> 00:20:32.631
CALLED SHARED SAVINGS OF YOU

00:20:32.698 --> 00:20:34.299
ACTUALLY SO THAT THE DOCTOR IN

00:20:34.366 --> 00:20:36.501
THE HOSPITAL THE PHARMACEUTICALS

00:20:36.568 --> 00:20:37.603
AND ALL THAT DEPENDING WHAT'S

00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:39.571
ALL LUMPED UNDER THE AC ON BELLA.

00:20:39.638 --> 00:20:41.273
YEAH BASICALLY YOU MANAGE THEM

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:41.873
OUT MONEY WE ACTUALLY END UP

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:43.575
SPENDING MORE YOU LOSE MONEY IF

00:20:43.642 --> 00:20:44.209
USE.

00:20:44.276 --> 00:20:45.577
DO IT FOR LESS YOU ACTUALLY GET

00:20:45.644 --> 00:20:47.346
TO KEEP THE SAVINGS ARE SOME

00:20:47.412 --> 00:20:48.413
SORT OF SAVINGS ARRANGEMENTS

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.015
THOSE CALL OFTENTIMES IT'S

00:20:50.082 --> 00:20:50.616
CULTURED STATING SO GIVES AN

00:20:50.682 --> 00:20:52.117
INCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE. TO IF YOU

00:20:52.184 --> 00:20:53.251
ACTUALLY LOWER THE COST OF CARE

00:20:53.318 --> 00:20:54.353
BY APPROVING IT OUT THAT THE

00:20:54.419 --> 00:20:55.587
COST EFFICIENCY YOU ACTUALLY GET

00:20:55.654 --> 00:21:01.193
TO KEEP SOME OF THAT MONEY SO

00:21:01.259 --> 00:21:01.827
YEAH THAT'S THE INCENTIVE TO TO

00:21:01.893 --> 00:21:04.963
TRIP IT'S NOT OVER SIMPLIFYING

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:06.164
THINGS -- A

00:21:06.231 --> 00:21:07.366
SEALS ARE LARGELY A MARKETING

00:21:07.432 --> 00:21:08.767
TERM IN A BRAND AND A BRANDING

00:21:08.834 --> 00:21:10.202
TERM -- WHAT

00:21:10.268 --> 00:21:12.337
IT WHAT IN A CO IS EVEN IN THIS

00:21:12.404 --> 00:21:13.739
DISCUSSION IT'S IT'S OBVIOUSLY?

00:21:13.805 --> 00:21:15.173
COMPLICATED AND OUR WORK

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.309
ACTUALLY SHOWS THERE ARE NINE

00:21:17.376 --> 00:21:18.477
DIFFERENT WAYS THAT PEOPLE GET

00:21:18.543 --> 00:21:19.645
PAID UNDER A CEOS ARE EIGHT

00:21:19.711 --> 00:21:20.846
DIFFERENT WAYS TO ATTRIBUTE

00:21:20.912 --> 00:21:22.047
PATIENTS TO IN A CO IN

00:21:22.114 --> 00:21:22.981
CALIFORNIA.

00:21:23.048 --> 00:21:25.917
SO I I THINK I WOULD SAY WHAT IS

00:21:25.984 --> 00:21:27.619
MORE IMPORTANT IS THE LOCUS OF

00:21:27.686 --> 00:21:29.354
CARE DELIVERY AND WHETHER THAT

00:21:29.421 --> 00:21:31.423
CARE DELIVERY SITE IS INTEGRATED

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:32.858
OR NOT SO --

00:21:32.924 --> 00:21:34.660
INTEGRATED CARE TENDS TO PRODUCE

00:21:34.726 --> 00:21:36.328
THE KIND OF RESULTS THAT PEOPLE

00:21:36.395 --> 00:21:37.763
ARE LOOKING FOR SPECIAL FOR

00:21:37.829 --> 00:21:39.164
CHRONIC CARE WHATEVER GETS

00:21:39.231 --> 00:21:41.299
LABELED IS ALMOST SECONDARY AND

00:21:41.366 --> 00:21:43.635
IF YOU CAN TOLERATE ONE MORE

00:21:43.702 --> 00:21:45.637
SLIDE WE DID.

00:21:45.704 --> 00:21:46.171
I JUST WANT TO SHOW YOU

00:21:46.238 --> 00:21:49.708
SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE THANK YOU

00:21:49.775 --> 00:21:51.343
USE USE THE USE OF YOUR SLIDE --

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:52.010
YEAH I MEAN THERE'S LOTS OF GOOD

00:21:52.077 --> 00:21:52.744
ONES WE YOU KNOW WE CAN SPEND

00:21:52.811 --> 00:21:54.579
ALL DAY SO THIS IS THE THE CURVE

00:21:54.646 --> 00:21:56.314
A SHOWED YOU ABOUT THE LEVEL OF

00:21:56.381 --> 00:21:58.183
RISK AND AGAIN.

00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:00.118
ALL ON ATTRIBUTE TO DELORES ON

00:22:00.185 --> 00:22:02.220
THIS WE ASK FOR ANY CO FLAG SO

00:22:02.287 --> 00:22:03.789
WE ACTUALLY IN OUR DATABASE CAN

00:22:03.855 --> 00:22:06.224
KNOW WHO'S IN ANY CO HAS A

00:22:06.291 --> 00:22:07.793
HEALTH PLAN WOODS WOULD WOULD

00:22:07.859 --> 00:22:10.228
SELF REPORT.

00:22:10.295 --> 00:22:10.829
THIS IS WHERE THEY LAND RIGHT

00:22:10.896 --> 00:22:11.563
NOW.

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:13.799
SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN

00:22:13.865 --> 00:22:15.300
AND NOTHING ON A IT'S NOT AS

00:22:15.367 --> 00:22:17.002
GOOD AS MAYBE THE HIGHEST END OF

00:22:17.069 --> 00:22:18.170
THE INTEGRATED GROUPS AND WE'RE

00:22:18.236 --> 00:22:20.639
UPDATING THAT INFORMATION NOW --

00:22:20.706 --> 00:22:22.340
SO WE'LL HAVE MORE UPDATES BUT I

00:22:22.407 --> 00:22:23.942
GUESS THE MAIN POINT IS WE HAVE

00:22:24.009 --> 00:22:24.743
THE CAPABILITY TO DO THIS AND

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:27.579
WE'RE NOW ASKING THOSE HARDERQUESTIONS ABOUT.

00:22:27.646 --> 00:22:32.250
WHAT'S UNDER THE HOOD.

00:22:32.317 --> 00:22:34.586
THANK YOU THAT SAID IT'S VERY

00:22:34.653 --> 00:22:39.157
INTERESTING I THINK IT WILL --

00:22:39.224 --> 00:22:40.192
I GUESS THE OTHER.

00:22:40.258 --> 00:22:43.862
QUESTION I WAS HAVING IS IS THAT --

00:22:43.929 --> 00:22:46.164
THAT IS SO I AND I GUESS UNDER

00:22:46.231 --> 00:22:47.766
MEDICARE CARED VANTAGE --

00:22:47.833 --> 00:22:48.500
THERE --

00:22:48.567 --> 00:22:49.901
DOING SOME PAYMENT MODELS AND

00:22:49.968 --> 00:22:50.936
AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

00:22:51.002 --> 00:22:52.604
CAPITATION RATE SO OFTEN WHAT

00:22:52.671 --> 00:22:53.572
HAPPENS IS THAT IT SHOULD AT

00:22:53.638 --> 00:22:54.506
LEAST AT THE HEALTH PLAN LEVEL

00:22:54.573 --> 00:22:54.940
WHERE YOU HAVE --

00:22:55.006 --> 00:22:56.475
PEOPLE PAYING PREMIUMS INTO

00:22:56.541 --> 00:23:00.645
THOSE WE WE DON'T WANT CHARTER

00:23:00.712 --> 00:23:01.580
BASICALLY WE'VE ACTUALLY MADE

00:23:01.646 --> 00:23:02.414
ILLEGAL FOR YOU TO CHARGE

00:23:02.481 --> 00:23:03.448
DIFFERENT PREMIUMS TO PEOPLE

00:23:03.515 --> 00:23:04.783
BASED ON THE CONDITION THAT WE

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:05.617
SHOULD HAVE THAT KIND OF

00:23:05.684 --> 00:23:06.985
DISCRIMINATION BUT CLEARLY.

00:23:07.052 --> 00:23:09.087
PEOPLE DEPENDING ON WHAT THE

00:23:09.154 --> 00:23:09.688
CONDITIONS THEY HAVE WILL COST

00:23:09.755 --> 00:23:11.523
DIFFERENTLY --

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:13.525
SO IN TERMS.

00:23:13.592 --> 00:23:14.960
SAYS SOMEONE THINGS WE WANT TO

00:23:15.026 --> 00:23:15.761
TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE

00:23:15.827 --> 00:23:16.962
AVOID THIS.

00:23:17.028 --> 00:23:19.097
ADVERSE SELECTION PROBLEM RIGHT

00:23:19.164 --> 00:23:21.333
AND AND FOR EXAMPLE IN THE

00:23:21.399 --> 00:23:24.236
MEDICARE ADVANTAGE A CEOS --

00:23:24.302 --> 00:23:25.470
THEY'VE ACTUALLY YOU KNOW GIVE

00:23:25.537 --> 00:23:26.905
PAYMENT BASED ON AT LEAST SOME

00:23:26.972 --> 00:23:28.240
ESTIMATION WHAT THE COST WOULD

00:23:28.306 --> 00:23:30.976
BE TO GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY

00:23:31.042 --> 00:23:32.511
CREATORS COST SAVINGS THROUGH.

00:23:32.577 --> 00:23:34.646
WITH IT AND CARE INNOVATION AND

00:23:34.713 --> 00:23:35.947
SO FORTH.

00:23:36.014 --> 00:23:40.218
WE DID YOUR THOUGHTS ON ON HOW

00:23:40.285 --> 00:23:41.987
WE MIGHT TRY IT IT'S FROM

00:23:42.053 --> 00:23:42.954
LOOKING AT THIS DATA.

00:23:43.021 --> 00:23:44.389
WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT

00:23:44.456 --> 00:23:45.557
INTEGRATED MODELS IS THERE?

00:23:45.624 --> 00:23:47.492
IN TERMS OF THEIR PAYMENT

00:23:47.559 --> 00:23:49.561
MECHANISMS --

00:23:49.628 --> 00:23:51.530
MATTER DDC PARTICULAR MODELS

00:23:51.596 --> 00:23:57.002
THAT THAT SEEM TO SHOW THE MORE

00:23:57.068 --> 00:23:58.403
PROMISE IN THAT REGARD.

00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:59.271
YES -- WE

00:23:59.337 --> 00:24:00.305
DIDN'T HAVE TIME BUT THE THE

00:24:00.372 --> 00:24:01.606
TREND INFORMATION ON COMMERCIAL

00:24:01.673 --> 00:24:03.308
IS PERFECTLY NEARED IN MEDICARE --

00:24:03.375 --> 00:24:03.842
MEDICARE VERSUS MEDICARE

00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:04.442
ADVANTAGE --

00:24:04.509 --> 00:24:05.177
SO AND I THINK THE IMPORTANT

00:24:05.243 --> 00:24:06.545
PART IS ON THE CLINICAL MEASURES

00:24:06.611 --> 00:24:07.045
FOR MEDICARE ADVANTAGE.

00:24:07.112 --> 00:24:10.949
GROUP VANTAGE POPULATION SO --

00:24:11.016 --> 00:24:12.717
AND I THE INCENTIVES YOU'RE

00:24:12.784 --> 00:24:13.985
TALKING ABOUT I THINK --

00:24:14.052 --> 00:24:15.921
OR THE STAR SYSTEM SO BASICALLY

00:24:15.987 --> 00:24:17.022
IF YOU LOOK AT THE STARS SYSTEM

00:24:17.088 --> 00:24:18.757
AS A PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT

00:24:18.824 --> 00:24:19.558
THAT HAS.

00:24:19.624 --> 00:24:20.725
BOTH --

00:24:20.792 --> 00:24:22.828
INCENTIVE DOLLARS TO IT AND

00:24:22.894 --> 00:24:24.563
PENALTIES FOR UNDER PERFORMANCE

00:24:24.629 --> 00:24:26.464
THAT'S ESSENTIALLY BUILT ON THIS

00:24:26.531 --> 00:24:28.266
KIND OF DATA --

00:24:28.333 --> 00:24:32.404
THAT CMS AND GENERATE.

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:36.141
ENOUGH FINALLY EXIT --

00:24:36.208 --> 00:24:37.742
AND I LOOKING FOR EXPLORING SOME

00:24:37.809 --> 00:24:38.810
OF THESE THINGS ALSO THEIR

00:24:38.877 --> 00:24:40.212
FUTURE BUT THEIR NECKS PANELS TO

00:24:40.278 --> 00:24:42.380
BUT THE OTHER THING ACTUALLY I

00:24:42.447 --> 00:24:44.282
JUST -- MAKENOTE BECAUSE YOU MENTIONED ABOUT

00:24:44.349 --> 00:24:44.850
THE DIFFERENCE WE NORTHERN

00:24:44.916 --> 00:24:46.618
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA NOW --

00:24:46.685 --> 00:24:48.386
THE DARTMOUTH ATLAS FOLKS HAD

00:24:48.453 --> 00:24:49.487
ACTUALLY DID A STUDY MAYBE ABOUT

00:24:49.554 --> 00:24:50.388
TEN THINKS ABOUT TEN OR FIFTEEN

00:24:50.455 --> 00:24:51.089
YEARS AGO.

00:24:51.156 --> 00:24:53.325
AND THEY ACTUALLY LOOKED AT END

00:24:53.391 --> 00:24:55.260
OF LIFE CARE AND THEY DID JUST

00:24:55.327 --> 00:24:56.161
LOOK AT MEDICARE DATA BECAUSE

00:24:56.228 --> 00:24:57.128
THAT'S WHAT THEY HAD WORKING

00:24:57.195 --> 00:24:57.696
WITH THEM.

00:24:57.762 --> 00:25:01.633
AND ACTUALLY MADE NOTE THAT --

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:06.338
UTILIZATION FOR END OF LIFE CARE --

00:25:06.404 --> 00:25:07.105
SO -- I

00:25:07.172 --> 00:25:08.373
DON'T KNOW IF THINGS HAVE

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:11.142
CHANGED OVER TIME OR IS IT JUST

00:25:11.209 --> 00:25:12.143
THAT AND THAT THEY ALSO NOTED

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:12.944
THAT.

00:25:13.011 --> 00:25:14.412
SORT OF PRICE PER UNIT WAS

00:25:14.479 --> 00:25:15.881
HIGHER NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SO

00:25:15.947 --> 00:25:17.649
PRICE PER UNIT SERVICE.

00:25:17.716 --> 00:25:19.384
BUT THAT BUT THE ACTUAL BUT THE

00:25:19.451 --> 00:25:21.086
UTILIZATION ACTUALLY WAS HIGHER

00:25:21.152 --> 00:25:21.620
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THEY

00:25:21.686 --> 00:25:23.154
ACTUALLY TREATED POTENTIALLY

00:25:23.221 --> 00:25:24.256
TOWARD ACTUALLY.

00:25:24.322 --> 00:25:25.156
YOU SAID MORE YELTSIN'S MORE

00:25:25.223 --> 00:25:27.058
COMPETITION BUT THE ACTUALLY THE

00:25:27.125 --> 00:25:28.760
HAVING MORE SPECIALISTS AND

00:25:28.827 --> 00:25:29.694
HAVING MORE ICE YOU BEDS

00:25:29.761 --> 00:25:30.962
AVAILABLE MEANT THAT PEOPLE ARE

00:25:31.029 --> 00:25:32.030
MORE LIKELY TO END UP IN ONE

00:25:32.097 --> 00:25:34.199
WHICH WAS MORE INTENSIVE.

00:25:34.266 --> 00:25:35.133
SO I KNOW WHETHER YOU --

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:38.737
YOU HAD A CHANCE TO EXPLORE --

00:25:38.803 --> 00:25:39.738
THAT WHETHER THERE'S A BEEN A

00:25:39.804 --> 00:25:40.805
SECULAR TREND SINCE THAT STUDY

00:25:40.872 --> 00:25:41.840
WAS DONE BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO BE

00:25:41.907 --> 00:25:45.543
LITTLE COUNTER TO WHAT YOU'RE

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:46.177
SEEING NOW WITH THE DAY THAT YOU

00:25:46.244 --> 00:25:47.846
HAVE -- I'D

00:25:47.913 --> 00:25:49.814
SAY I AM FAMILIAR WITH THE DATA

00:25:49.881 --> 00:25:50.382
I THINK THAT IS A DIFFERENT

00:25:50.448 --> 00:25:51.283
PHENOMENON.

00:25:51.349 --> 00:25:52.517
ARE COMPARISONS ARE LARGELY

00:25:52.584 --> 00:25:53.985
COMMERCIAL POPULATION SO THAT WE

00:25:54.052 --> 00:25:55.120
CAN DO MEDICARE.

00:25:55.186 --> 00:25:55.820
AND AND THEY ARE CLINICALLY RISK

00:25:55.887 --> 00:25:57.422
ADJUSTED SO PRESUMABLY UP TO THE

00:25:57.489 --> 00:25:59.457
POINT WHERE YOU CAN DO THIS THE

00:25:59.524 --> 00:26:00.859
POPULATIONS ARE MATCHED --

00:26:00.926 --> 00:26:02.394
THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN NORTH

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:04.396
AND SOUTH SEEM TO BE --

00:26:04.462 --> 00:26:05.797
RELATED --

00:26:05.864 --> 00:26:07.098
TO UNIT PRICING --

00:26:07.165 --> 00:26:11.736
AND THAT SAID IN DETAIL BY

00:26:11.803 --> 00:26:14.306
DOCTOR SHUFFLER ANOTHER SAID AT

00:26:14.372 --> 00:26:15.840
BERKELEY --

00:26:15.907 --> 00:26:18.476
NOT UTILIZATION DIFFERENT.

00:26:18.543 --> 00:26:20.078
AND THE BIGGEST ONE LAST SUMMER

00:26:20.145 --> 00:26:23.515
TECHNICAL QUESTION BUT GIVES

00:26:23.581 --> 00:26:24.716
YOUR TO DATE A GUY YOU'RE DOING

00:26:24.783 --> 00:26:27.619
THE AND ATLAS --

00:26:27.686 --> 00:26:28.620
WHAT DO YOU THINK I MEAN SOME

00:26:28.687 --> 00:26:29.955
PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT ONE THE HOLY

00:26:30.021 --> 00:26:31.289
GRAIL SAYS RISK BASE PREMIUM

00:26:31.356 --> 00:26:32.090
PAYMENT RIGHT WHETHER IT'S

00:26:32.157 --> 00:26:33.091
PREMIUMS ARE POOL AND

00:26:33.158 --> 00:26:35.427
REDISTRIBUTION OR SOME KIND OF --

00:26:35.493 --> 00:26:37.662
HIGH RISK POOL OR SOMETHING.

00:26:37.729 --> 00:26:39.798
D. AS IS THE DATA TECHNOLOGY

00:26:39.864 --> 00:26:41.032
THERE YET IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY

00:26:41.099 --> 00:26:42.534
DOING RISK BASED PAYMENTS OF

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:45.937
BASICALLY ADJUSTING THE PAYMENT.

00:26:46.004 --> 00:26:46.538
TO BUT IS HEALTH PLANS OTHER

00:26:46.604 --> 00:26:47.305
RISK BEARING ORGANIZATIONS BASED

00:26:47.372 --> 00:26:49.207
ON THE RISK OF THE POPULATION

00:26:49.274 --> 00:26:51.443
CAN WE DO THAT ACTUALLY ENOUGH

00:26:51.509 --> 00:26:53.411
SO THAT PEOPLE CAN'T OVERLY GAME

00:26:53.478 --> 00:26:54.212
THE SYSTEM.

00:26:54.279 --> 00:26:55.714
AND THEN PROVIDE THIS KIND OF

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:57.082
SENTENCE TO TAKE ON MORE PEOPLE

00:26:57.148 --> 00:26:58.316
CHRONIC CONDITIONS --

00:26:58.383 --> 00:27:00.385
IS IS THE TECHNOLOGY THAT REALLY

00:27:00.452 --> 00:27:01.920
QUITE GOOD ENOUGH TO DO THAT.

00:27:01.987 --> 00:27:03.288
SO THE THE WAY AN ANSWER I DON'T

00:27:03.355 --> 00:27:05.890
THINK THIS IS A TECHNOLOGY FIX I

00:27:05.957 --> 00:27:07.258
I THINK THE THE PROBLEMS ARE

00:27:07.325 --> 00:27:09.527
VERY VERY CLEAR AND TAKE A

00:27:09.594 --> 00:27:11.429
FAIRLY SIMPLE STEPS TOWARD

00:27:11.496 --> 00:27:13.064
GETTING PEOPLE INTO INTEGRATED

00:27:13.131 --> 00:27:14.499
SYSTEMS -- I

00:27:14.566 --> 00:27:17.736
REMEMBER THE DAYS WHEN THERE IS

00:27:17.802 --> 00:27:19.137
RISK ADJUSTED CAPITATION.

00:27:19.204 --> 00:27:19.904
REALLY COMPLICATED REALLY HARD

00:27:19.971 --> 00:27:21.439
TO EXPLAIN I THINK BASICALLY

00:27:21.506 --> 00:27:23.875
THERE'S A LOT WE CAN DO SHORT OF

00:27:23.942 --> 00:27:25.910
THAT KIND OF R. A. I. R. MACHINE

00:27:25.977 --> 00:27:27.178
LEARNING KIND OF ENVIRONMENT --

00:27:27.245 --> 00:27:29.447
AND MOST OF IT IS AVAILABLE THE

00:27:29.514 --> 00:27:32.117
DATA THAT WE WE LOOK AT NOW.

00:27:32.183 --> 00:27:32.884
RIGHT THANK YOU ANY OTHER

00:27:32.951 --> 00:27:34.786

STRATEGIES IMPROVE CHRONIC

00:27:54.973 --> 00:27:57.242
DISEASE CARE AND AND REALLY

CONTEXT ON COVER CALIFORNIA.

00:28:45.156 --> 00:28:46.458
THERE ARE SEVERAL MAIN AREAS WE

00:28:46.524 --> 00:28:49.160
FOCUS ON CLEARLY AFFORDABILITY

00:28:49.227 --> 00:28:50.161
IS.

00:28:50.228 --> 00:28:51.830
ONE ACCESS QUALITY AND THE

00:28:51.896 --> 00:28:53.765
OVERALL DELIVERY SYSTEM.

ENROLLMENT.

00:29:04.442 --> 00:29:05.577
AND ONE OF THE HEALTHIEST

00:29:05.643 --> 00:29:06.444
ENROLLMENT POPULATIONS IN THE

00:29:06.511 --> 00:29:08.046
COUNTRY.

00:29:08.113 --> 00:29:10.448
ON AVERAGE ARE CONSUMERS ARE 20%

00:29:10.515 --> 00:29:12.150
HEALTHIER THAN THOSE ENROLLED IN

00:29:12.217 --> 00:29:13.651
THE FEDERALLY FACILITATED

00:29:13.718 --> 00:29:14.385
MARKETPLACE IS.

00:29:14.452 --> 00:29:16.688
IN OTHER STATES.

00:29:16.754 --> 00:29:18.156
UNDERLYING ALL THIS IS HOW MANY

00:29:18.223 --> 00:29:19.757
STABLE AND EFFICIENT DELIVERY

00:29:19.824 --> 00:29:22.760
SYSTEM. ONE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR

00:29:22.827 --> 00:29:24.062
THE PROVISION OF EFFECTIVE AND

00:29:24.129 --> 00:29:25.897
EFFICIENT CARE.

AND THAT'S FROM THE SPEND MOST

00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:33.104
OF MY TIME THIS AFTERNOON.

00:29:33.171 --> 00:29:34.572
AS MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW WE HAVE

00:29:34.639 --> 00:29:36.841
WHAT IS CALLED ATTACHMENT.

00:29:36.908 --> 00:29:38.610
SEVEN WHICH PLACES CONTRACTUAL

00:29:38.676 --> 00:29:40.211
REQUIREMENTS ON ARE QUALIFIED

00:29:40.278 --> 00:29:41.179
HEALTH PLANS.

00:29:41.246 --> 00:29:43.481
AND THEIR PROVIDERS.

00:29:43.548 --> 00:29:44.949
THERE ARE NINE MEAN ARTICLES

00:29:45.016 --> 00:29:46.618
WITH A HOST OF SUB ARTICLES

00:29:46.684 --> 00:29:48.286
WITHIN EACH ONE OF THOSE.

00:29:48.353 --> 00:29:50.388
RANGING FROM IMPROVING CARE.

00:29:50.455 --> 00:29:51.656

PROMOTE HIGHER VALUE CARE.

00:30:06.371 --> 00:30:07.939
SOME OF THE RESULTS WE ARE SEEN

00:30:08.006 --> 00:30:09.741
MOSTLY FROM THE TO THESE TWO

00:30:09.807 --> 00:30:10.475
THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN PLAN YEAR

00:30:10.542 --> 00:30:12.243
ARE.

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:13.578
VETERAN NATIONAL ANALYSIS SHOW

00:30:13.645 --> 00:30:15.146
THAT HEALTH PLANS WORKING WITH

00:30:15.213 --> 00:30:16.814
THEIR NETWORK PROVIDERS HAVE

00:30:16.881 --> 00:30:18.116
MADE STEADY IMPROVEMENT IN

00:30:18.183 --> 00:30:19.751
QUALITY.

00:30:19.817 --> 00:30:21.252
CONSUMERS ARE GETTING THAT

00:30:21.319 --> 00:30:23.922
QUALITY CARE AT THE RIGHT TIME.

00:30:23.988 --> 00:30:24.989
AND WE ARE WORKING TOWARD

00:30:25.056 --> 00:30:27.926
REDUCING HEALTH DISPARITIES.

00:30:27.992 --> 00:30:29.661
AN EXAMPLE OF THIS ARE THE

00:30:29.727 --> 00:30:31.262
GLOBAL QUALITY RATINGS ON THE

00:30:31.329 --> 00:30:32.964
STAR RATING SYSTEMS A DOCTOR

00:30:33.031 --> 00:30:34.098
RIGHT OUT POINTED OUT.

00:30:34.165 --> 00:30:35.633
WHERE ALL OF OUR HEALTH PLANS

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:37.869

PURCHASERS IN PAIRS IS REALLY

00:47:09.126 --> 00:47:10.627

00:47:37.487 --> 00:47:38.655
WE BELIEVE THAT --

00:47:38.722 --> 00:47:39.823
THE USE OF MEANINGFUL MEASURES

00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:40.624
IS REALLY IMPORTANT WE NEED TO

00:47:40.691 --> 00:47:42.526
MOVE BEYOND TRADITIONAL.

00:47:42.593 --> 00:47:44.928
CHECK THE BOX KIND OF MEASURES

PATIENT REPORTED OUTCOMES --

00:47:50.467 --> 00:47:51.969
WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO --

00:47:52.035 --> 00:47:53.303
BUT WE I THINK THAT --

00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:56.640
THEY'RE GOING AND NATIONALLY BUT

00:47:56.707 --> 00:47:57.975

TOGETHER.

00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:01.378
WE NEED TO PURSUE ADVANCE

00:48:01.445 --> 00:48:02.579
PAYMENT MODELS --

00:48:02.646 --> 00:48:03.914
DOUG AND I WERE TALKING EARLIER

00:48:03.981 --> 00:48:04.881
THAT THERE.

00:48:04.948 --> 00:48:08.051
SEEMS TO BE UP THE DOLLARS MUCH

00:48:08.118 --> 00:48:09.653
PROGRESS IN MOVING TOWARD AWAY

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:10.687
FOR MOVING AWAY FROM FEE FOR

00:48:10.754 --> 00:48:11.355

00:48:11.421 --> 00:48:12.956
TOWARD TOWARD VALUE BASED

00:48:13.023 --> 00:48:14.124
PAYMENT MODELS IN WHICH

00:48:14.191 --> 00:48:15.492
PROVIDERS REWARDED FOR

00:48:15.559 --> 00:48:18.061
DELIVERING GOOD QUALITY THAT'S

00:48:18.128 --> 00:48:21.198
WHAT WE WANT --

00:48:21.265 --> 00:48:25.369
SO THAT'S THAT'S A LAMP ISSUES --

00:48:25.435 --> 00:48:27.404
SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS FOR

00:48:27.471 --> 00:48:28.438
PURCHASERS STUFF WE'VE BEEN

THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

00:48:40.684 --> 00:48:42.653
OTHER STATES HAVE ACTUALLY SET

00:48:42.719 --> 00:48:46.056
TARGETS FOR INCREASED INVESTMENT

00:48:46.123 --> 00:48:49.059

A PROVIDER'S BUT IT'S IMPORTANT

00:49:23.293 --> 00:49:23.794
TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION --

00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:27.164
BECAUSE DELIVERY MALLS ADVANCED

00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:28.598

00:51:05.262 --> 00:51:06.730
INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL.

00:51:06.797 --> 00:51:08.165

00:51:08.231 --> 00:51:10.167
ABOUT THE ACA AND FOR SOMEONE

00:51:10.233 --> 00:51:11.968

THESE REMOTE REGIONS WE THINK

00:54:48.985 --> 00:54:50.820
THERE IS SOME PROMISE ESPECIALLY

00:54:50.887 --> 00:54:52.255
FOR SOMETHING LIKE DEPRESSION

OUR P. P. R. P. PO'S MEMBERS WHO

00:55:15.545 --> 00:55:17.981

AND HOW FAR WE HAVE TO GO TO

00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:48.798
BRING THAT THE FULL SCALE LIKE

00:57:48.865 --> 00:57:50.600

WITH IT THAT OFTEN TIMES.

00:58:26.903 --> 00:58:28.705
IS THE CORE OF WHERE TO SAVINGS

00:58:28.771 --> 00:58:29.906
EVENTUALLY COMES FROM RIGHT AND

00:58:29.973 --> 00:58:31.407
AND THE KNOWLEDGE THE POSITION

00:58:31.474 --> 00:58:33.910

00:58:33.977 --> 00:58:35.445
WITH THE PATIENT.

SITES SO I KNOW EACH OF YOU

00:58:37.313 --> 00:58:37.580
MENTIONED --

00:58:37.647 --> 00:58:39.382
THIS I GUESS I'M JUST TRYING TO

00:58:39.449 --> 00:58:41.184
GET A SENSE OF OKAY WELL --

00:58:41.251 --> 00:58:42.752
ARE WE ARE WE ARE READY THERE WE

00:58:42.819 --> 00:58:45.054
HAVE PEOPLE THERE HOW FAR ALONG

00:58:45.121 --> 00:58:46.689
ARE WE AND IF --

00:58:46.756 --> 00:58:48.424
AND FOR THE WAYS AGO WE GET

00:58:48.491 --> 00:58:50.159
THERE HOW MUCH HOW FAR CAN WE

00:58:50.226 --> 00:58:51.794
BEND THE COST CURVE BY DOING

00:58:51.861 --> 00:58:52.528
THAT.

00:58:52.595 --> 00:58:54.163
SO I DON'T NOBODY'S DISCO MARCH

00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:55.665

00:58:55.732 --> 00:58:56.532
REFERENCE SENSE OF YOUR

00:58:56.599 --> 00:58:57.800
TESTIMONY READY BUT I GUESS THAT

00:58:57.867 --> 00:58:58.968
THAT'S A QUESTION LIKE.

00:58:59.035 --> 00:59:00.503
HOW MUCH MORE CAN WE DO THERE

00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:03.973
AND -- AND

00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:07.143
AND WHAT WOULD RESULT FROM THAT --

00:59:07.210 --> 00:59:09.312
DOCTORS PAN AND MEMBERS IT LET

00:59:09.379 --> 00:59:10.346
ME TART BY SAYING WORK WE'RE

00:59:10.413 --> 00:59:12.115
NOT THERE YET OKAY I THINK WE

00:59:12.181 --> 00:59:13.516
HAVE A WAYS TO GO.

00:59:13.583 --> 00:59:15.084
BY YOU'VE HEARD THE TERM

00:59:15.151 --> 00:59:16.886
ALIGNMENT USED OFTEN THIS

00:59:16.953 --> 00:59:18.054
AFTERNOON.

00:59:18.121 --> 00:59:19.355
AND I THINK THE THE MORE WE CAN

00:59:19.422 --> 00:59:21.491
ALIGN WITH WHAT OTHERS ARE DOING.

00:59:21.557 --> 00:59:23.259
TO A COMMON DEFINITION.

00:59:23.326 --> 00:59:24.594
RELATIVE TO THE VARIOUS THINGS

00:59:24.661 --> 00:59:27.130
THAT WE TALKED ABOUT THE FOR

00:59:27.196 --> 00:59:27.730
PATIENTS CENTER MEDICAL HOME

00:59:27.797 --> 00:59:28.064
YOU'VE HEARD.

00:59:28.131 --> 00:59:29.866
ACCOUNTABLE CARE ORGANIZATIONS

00:59:29.933 --> 00:59:30.667
YOU'VE HEARD INTEGRATED HEALTH

00:59:30.733 --> 00:59:33.469
CARE ALL MEANS DIFFERENT THINGS

00:59:33.536 --> 00:59:34.771
TO DIFFERENT FOLKS AND SO

00:59:34.837 --> 00:59:37.573
ALIGNMENT AROUND THE DEFINITIONS.

00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:39.175
OF WHAT THOSE ARE I THINK WILL

00:59:39.242 --> 00:59:40.443
BE IMPORTANT.

00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:41.911
AND THEN THE THIRD THING IS THE

00:59:41.978 --> 00:59:45.148
ALIGNMENT AROUND THAT AS DR

00:59:45.214 --> 00:59:46.649
JONASSON MENTIONED EARLIER.

00:59:46.716 --> 00:59:47.817
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE A

00:59:47.884 --> 00:59:49.585
CALPERS NUMBER.

00:59:49.652 --> 00:59:50.520
A MEDI CAL MEMBER A COVER

00:59:50.586 --> 00:59:52.288
CALIFORNIA NUMBER WHEN YOU GO IN

00:59:52.355 --> 00:59:53.756
TO SEE YOUR PHYSICIAN.

00:59:53.823 --> 00:59:54.557
ARE YOU GOING TO A HOSPITAL

00:59:54.624 --> 00:59:56.559
SETTING.

00:59:56.626 --> 00:59:57.927
YOU'RE A PATIENT.

00:59:57.994 --> 00:59:59.195
AND YOU'RE NOT VIEWED

00:59:59.262 --> 01:00:00.797
DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE OF THE FACT

01:00:00.863 --> 01:00:02.432
THAT YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT LABEL

01:00:02.498 --> 01:00:03.700
SO TO SPEAK.

01:00:03.766 --> 01:00:05.501
ASSOCIATED WITH YOU SO WE'D

01:00:05.568 --> 01:00:06.035
THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM FOR

01:00:06.102 --> 01:00:07.503
IMPROVEMENT --

01:00:07.570 --> 01:00:09.339
I WOULD LIKE TO CALL OUT.

01:00:09.405 --> 01:00:10.940
WHAT I. HA IS DOING IN THIS

01:00:11.007 --> 01:00:11.941
REGARD -- IS

01:00:12.008 --> 01:00:14.410
REALLY SETTING THE STANDARD.

01:00:14.477 --> 01:00:17.013
FOR DEVELOPING THOSE STANDARDS --

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:18.514
I DON'T THINK JEFF SPOKE TO THE

01:00:18.581 --> 01:00:20.149
ACCOUNTABLE CARE ORGANIZATION

01:00:20.216 --> 01:00:21.317
STANDARD DATA SET THAT THEY'VE

01:00:21.384 --> 01:00:22.151
DONE.

01:00:22.218 --> 01:00:23.987
WHERE WE'VE COLLECTIVELY AGREED

01:00:24.053 --> 01:00:25.755
TO WHAT THOSE DATA SETS ARE FOR

01:00:25.822 --> 01:00:27.423
ACCOUNTABLE CARE ORGANIZATIONS --

01:00:27.490 --> 01:00:29.592
BUT THE MORE WE WORK WITH GROUPS

01:00:29.659 --> 01:00:32.829
LIKE I HA I THINK THE QUICKER WE

01:00:32.895 --> 01:00:33.463
WILL GET TO WHERE WE WOULD LIKE

01:00:33.529 --> 01:00:36.632
TO GO.

01:00:36.699 --> 01:00:38.735
ACTUALLY JUST CENTER FOR ED SO

01:00:38.801 --> 01:00:40.136
HOW FAR ALONG I MEAN A TO BE

01:00:40.203 --> 01:00:41.871
LICENSE A LITTLE BIT AFTER

01:00:41.938 --> 01:00:43.339
QUESTION BUT HOW I MEAN --

01:00:43.406 --> 01:00:45.975
WE LIKE HALFWAY THERE COR THE

01:00:46.042 --> 01:00:49.379
WAY THEY'RE TEN FOR SALE RELIEF

01:00:49.445 --> 01:00:52.115
DOWN THE BOTTOM 10% OF THE WAY

01:00:52.181 --> 01:00:53.082
THERE -- I

01:00:53.149 --> 01:00:54.050
WOULD HATE TO PUT A PERCENTAGE

01:00:54.117 --> 01:00:55.251
ON IT -- I

01:00:55.318 --> 01:00:56.352
WOULD SAY WERE FURTHER ALONG

01:00:56.419 --> 01:00:57.153
THEM WE HAVE BEEN --

01:00:57.220 --> 01:00:58.121
AS I MENTIONED IN MY EARLIER

01:00:58.187 --> 01:00:59.022
COMMENTS WE ARE SEEN A MOVEMENT

01:00:59.088 --> 01:01:00.556
UP [inaudible]

01:01:00.623 --> 01:01:01.991
IN --

01:01:02.058 --> 01:01:03.526
PROVIDERS PARTICIPATING IN

01:01:03.593 --> 01:01:05.128
INTEGRATED SYSTEMS --

01:01:05.194 --> 01:01:06.662
BUT THERE AREN'T ENOUGH OF THEM

01:01:06.729 --> 01:01:09.232
AND IN AGAIN ALSO NOTE DR

01:01:09.298 --> 01:01:10.466
JONASSON MENTIONED.

01:01:10.533 --> 01:01:12.268
RURAL AREAS INTEGRATED HEALTH

01:01:12.335 --> 01:01:14.237
CARE IN RURAL AREAS IS REALLY

01:01:14.303 --> 01:01:14.937
REALLY HARD.

01:01:15.004 --> 01:01:16.606
YEAH AND SO WHAT YOU PUT IN

01:01:16.672 --> 01:01:18.875
PLACE IN A URBAN AREA MAY NOT

01:01:18.941 --> 01:01:20.610
NECESSARILY WORK IN A RURAL

01:01:20.676 --> 01:01:22.378
SETTING AND SO WE'VE GOT TO

01:01:22.445 --> 01:01:24.080
BRIDGE THAT GAP AS WELL.

01:01:24.147 --> 01:01:25.481
SO -- WERE

01:01:25.548 --> 01:01:26.349
WAYS AWAY.

01:01:26.416 --> 01:01:28.618
I THINK WE UNDERSTAND WHAT WE

01:01:28.684 --> 01:01:30.153
NEED TO DO TO GET THERE.

01:01:30.219 --> 01:01:31.254
WE JUST NEED TO GET KICKED IN

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:32.055
THE REAR END A LITTLE BIT HARDER

01:01:32.121 --> 01:01:33.823
TO GET US THERE FASTER THAN WE'D

01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:36.092
LIKE OKAY AND MAYBE JUST ONE

01:01:36.159 --> 01:01:37.160
OTHER AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED IS.

01:01:37.226 --> 01:01:38.428
ASK YOU THE SAME QUESTIONS YOU

01:01:38.494 --> 01:01:39.128
CAN GIVE THAT MIND SO IF WE WERE

01:01:39.195 --> 01:01:43.099
ACTUALLY QUOTE ALL THE WAY THERE --

01:01:43.166 --> 01:01:44.801
BECAUSE IT WAS WORRIED ABOUT

01:01:44.867 --> 01:01:47.303
HEALTHCARE COSTS WERE ACT GOING

01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:49.205
IF WE WERE QUOTE ALL THE WAY

01:01:49.272 --> 01:01:49.772
THERE ARE ALMOST ALL THE WAY

01:01:49.839 --> 01:01:51.074
THERE.

01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:51.841
IS THAT GOING TO MAKE A

01:01:51.908 --> 01:01:53.676
SUBSTANTIAL BEND IN THE COST

01:01:53.743 --> 01:01:55.111
CURVE ARE WE GOING TO BE ABLE TO

01:01:55.178 --> 01:01:56.012
THEN SAY YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE

01:01:56.079 --> 01:01:56.879
GOING TO I MEAN REALIZE IF

01:01:56.946 --> 01:01:58.481
DEMOGRAPHICS WE HAVE TECHNOLOGY

01:01:58.548 --> 01:02:03.186
CHANGE BUT IN TERMS OF THE THE

01:02:03.252 --> 01:02:04.253
IT IS THEIR SAVINGS THAT YOU'RE

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:04.620
SAYING AS FAR.

01:02:04.687 --> 01:02:05.955
AS WHERE WE HOW FAR WE'VE GONE

01:02:06.022 --> 01:02:07.256
SO FAR IF WE ACTUALLY TOOK IT TO

01:02:07.323 --> 01:02:08.991
THAT KIND OF SCALE WE COULD GET

01:02:09.058 --> 01:02:10.226
IT ALL THE WAY THERE WE GOT AND

01:02:10.293 --> 01:02:11.327
WE A LOT OF PROBLEMS TO GET

01:02:11.394 --> 01:02:12.228
THEIR NUMBERS TO GO OVERCOME.

01:02:12.295 --> 01:02:13.729
WHAT IT IS THAT GOING TO RESULT

01:02:13.796 --> 01:02:16.766
IN A IT IN A PLACE WHERE YOU

01:02:16.833 --> 01:02:20.303
KNOW KOSTER GNOCCHI AGAIN AND?

01:02:20.369 --> 01:02:22.472
WILL HOPEFULLY SOME SAVINGS BUT

01:02:37.153 --> 01:02:38.988
BETWEEN AN INTEGRATED MODEL AND

01:02:39.055 --> 01:02:40.790

WE MOVE INTO THAT INTEGRATED

01:02:44.127 --> 01:02:45.094
APPROACH YOU'RE GOING TO SEE

01:02:45.161 --> 01:02:45.895
AFFORDABILITY --

01:02:45.962 --> 01:02:46.529
BECOME MORE PREVALENT THAN IT IS

THE OTHER THING IS WE DID SPEND

01:04:06.342 --> 01:04:07.343
TWO YEARS DEVELOPING OUR

01:04:27.930 --> 01:04:29.765
WE NEED TO GET THE VALUE WE NEED

01:04:29.832 --> 01:04:31.934
TO REACH WE NEED TO AND WE NEED

01:04:32.001 --> 01:04:33.669
TO PAY FOR HIGH VALUE CARE AND

01:04:33.736 --> 01:04:35.304
REDUCE LOW VALUE CARE.

01:04:35.371 --> 01:04:37.873
AND THAT IS THE WORK WERE

01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:43.045
CONTINUE TO USE IT I I AGAIN I

01:04:43.112 --> 01:04:44.647
KNOW IT'S SOMEWHAT ANSWER.

01:04:44.714 --> 01:04:46.015
AT THE BEGINNING ARE YOU HALFWAY

01:04:49.885 --> 01:04:50.987
LONELY THERE.

01:04:51.053 --> 01:04:53.322
I WOULD SAY WE'RE OVER WE'RE

01:04:53.389 --> 01:04:56.225
WE'RE OVER HALF OKAY A LOT TO DO

01:04:56.292 --> 01:04:57.893
BUT WE AYE IF YOU I CAME HERE IN

01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:58.594
TWO THOUSAND AND TWO WHEN WE

01:04:58.661 --> 01:05:00.096
WERE NEGOTIATING RIGHTS FROM

01:05:00.162 --> 01:05:01.130
SPREAD.

01:05:01.197 --> 01:05:02.465
AND WE DIDN'T HAVE A WAY TO

01:05:02.531 --> 01:05:04.100
MEASURE DISEASE MANAGEMENT SO

01:05:04.166 --> 01:05:06.702
EXCEPT FOR WHAT WE GOT ANNUALLY

01:05:06.769 --> 01:05:07.670
FROM HE DOES SO.

01:05:07.737 --> 01:05:09.605

THERE'S THE CONNECTION THEIR

01:05:18.614 --> 01:05:19.215
SIDE DIE DO I KNOWLEDGE THAT

OUR FOLKS ARE MARKED ACCOUNT

01:05:26.555 --> 01:05:27.790
PRIMARY KERR --

01:05:27.857 --> 01:05:28.691
I THINK IF YOU SIMPLY LOOK AT

01:05:28.758 --> 01:05:29.358
THE AMOUNT IS BEING SPENT

01:05:29.425 --> 01:05:31.260
PRIMARY CARE IN CALIFORNIA

01:05:31.327 --> 01:05:33.029
VERSUS SOME OF THE OTHER STATES --

01:05:33.095 --> 01:05:35.197
OREGON RHODE ISLAND SOME OTHERS

01:05:35.264 --> 01:05:39.502
WE SPEND LESS BOND AND I A

01:05:39.568 --> 01:05:40.836
THAT'S A CRUDE MEASURE OBVIOUSLY

01:05:40.903 --> 01:05:42.071
BUT BY THAT MEASURE WERE

01:05:42.138 --> 01:05:43.739
PROBABLY HALF TO TWO THIRDS OF

01:05:43.806 --> 01:05:44.607
THE WAY PART WHERE WE SHOULD BE

01:05:44.674 --> 01:05:45.274
IN TERMS OF THE RIGHT BALANCE OF

01:05:45.341 --> 01:05:47.743
SPENDING ON PRIMARY CARE VERSUS --

01:05:47.810 --> 01:05:52.248
STRICTLY CARE HOSPITAL CARE AND

SO ON IT'S NOT JUST THAT'S AND

01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:59.121
HARD TO PUT A NUMBER ON THAT BUT

01:05:59.188 --> 01:06:00.656
I THINK WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS

01:06:00.723 --> 01:06:02.224
SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN RECENT

01:06:02.291 --> 01:06:03.125
YEARS.

01:06:03.192 --> 01:06:04.527
PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE

QUALITY MEASURE FOR ADVERSE DRUG

01:08:18.594 --> 01:08:20.429
EVENTS HAS BEEN ENDORSED BY

01:08:20.496 --> 01:08:22.231
NATIONAL QUALITY FORUM.

01:08:22.298 --> 01:08:24.400

THE MOVEMENT TOWARD VALUE BASED

01:08:27.303 --> 01:08:28.404
PAYMENT HAS REALLY STALLED OVER

01:08:28.471 --> 01:08:30.339
THE LAST TEN YEARS --

01:08:30.406 --> 01:08:31.106
THERE'S A LOT OF EXCITEMENT

01:08:31.173 --> 01:08:31.740
ABOUT MOVING TO ADAPT BUT IT

01:08:31.807 --> 01:08:33.309
REALLY HASN'T MADE A LOT OF

01:08:33.375 --> 01:08:34.009
PROGRESS SO.

01:08:34.076 --> 01:08:40.883

I WAKE UP AT LEE WITH THE CUP IS

01:09:00.135 --> 01:09:01.270
HALF FULL OTHER DAYS I THINK

01:09:01.337 --> 01:09:02.238
IT'S HALF EMPTY --

01:09:02.304 --> 01:09:05.074
THERE'S A LOT TO BE PROUD OF IT

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:08.377
BUT A LOT STILL TO DO

01:09:08.444 --> 01:09:08.677
[inaudible]

01:09:08.744 --> 01:09:15.150
RIGHT [inaudible] THIRTY TWO NO

01:09:15.217 --> 01:09:16.185
THANK YOU --

01:09:16.252 --> 01:09:18.554
I I ACTUALLY I AND ACTUALLY

01:09:18.621 --> 01:09:19.889
BECAUSE EQUITY TO LOSE IN THE

01:09:19.955 --> 01:09:21.757
AUDIENCE I I HAVE TO ALSO

01:09:21.824 --> 01:09:22.958
ACKNOWLEDGE HER NUYS SAY THAT

WE'VE HAD SOME CONVERSATIONS AND

01:09:24.126 --> 01:09:25.060
WE FEEL HEARD THE NUMBER ABOUT

01:09:25.127 --> 01:09:26.128
THE 30%.

01:09:26.195 --> 01:09:28.097
I THINK THE CHALLENGES IS --

01:09:28.163 --> 01:09:32.334
SHOE TOLD ME I IS OKAY FOR ME TO

01:09:32.401 --> 01:09:36.472
SAY THIS.

01:09:36.539 --> 01:09:41.710
BUT I WILL SAY IS IS THAT.

01:09:41.777 --> 01:09:43.913
SO NOW IT'S ABOUT THAT WHAT YOU

01:09:43.979 --> 01:09:45.581
SAID WAS THAT AND NOW YOU AGREED

01:09:45.648 --> 01:09:46.682
WITH YOU IS IS THAT I OFTENTIMES

01:09:46.749 --> 01:09:47.449
YOU'LL KNOW 30% OR SOME

01:09:47.516 --> 01:09:49.218
PERCENTAGE SIZEABLE PERCENTAGE

01:09:49.285 --> 01:09:51.153
IS QUOTE WASTE BUT IT'S HARD TO

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:53.122
IDENTIFY WHAT IT IS.

01:09:53.188 --> 01:09:55.424
I MEAN V. CONCERT GLOBALLY SAY

01:09:55.491 --> 01:09:56.225
BUT YOU START SAYING EACH

01:09:56.292 --> 01:09:57.893
INDIVIDUAL DECISION WAS THIS THE

01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:59.061
RIGHT ONE IT'S CENTER I MEAN

01:09:59.128 --> 01:10:00.329
SOME PREY EASIER THAN OTHERS BUT

01:10:00.396 --> 01:10:01.697
IT'S NOT ALWAYS.

01:10:01.764 --> 01:10:02.631
THAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE

01:10:02.698 --> 01:10:04.266
CHALLENGES LIKE SO --

01:10:04.333 --> 01:10:04.900
AND I'VE SEEN DIFFERENT STUDIES

01:10:04.967 --> 01:10:05.501
PEOPLE TRIED TO PICK OUT WHICH

01:10:05.568 --> 01:10:08.938
ONES AND SO FORTH BUT PERHAPS --

01:10:09.004 --> 01:10:13.609
I THINK OF THE LOOKS LIKE YOU

01:10:13.676 --> 01:10:16.045
GOT SOME HANDS.

01:10:16.111 --> 01:10:16.979
ANSWER THAT I THINK IT'S

01:10:17.046 --> 01:10:17.947
IMPOSSIBLE TO DO BUT I THINK

01:10:18.013 --> 01:10:18.914
SOMETIMES IT CAN BE A LITTLE

01:10:18.981 --> 01:10:22.618
CHALLENGING AND PERHAPS CHRONIC

01:10:22.685 --> 01:10:23.986
CONDITIONS THAT SOCIAL

01:10:24.053 --> 01:10:25.654
DETERMINANTS YES AND HEALTH

01:10:25.721 --> 01:10:26.589
EQUITY --

01:10:26.655 --> 01:10:28.424
IT'S IT'S A IT'S A COMPONENT

01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:29.959
THAT WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE

BUT IT'S ALL PART OF A SCENE

01:12:06.555 --> 01:12:07.589
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM --

WILL ADDRESS SIR TO QUESTIONS

01:12:49.364 --> 01:12:49.631
TODAY -- THE

01:12:49.698 --> 01:12:51.900
FIRST IS WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE

01:12:51.967 --> 01:12:53.502
QUALITY OF CARE --

01:12:53.569 --> 01:12:57.172
IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM --

01:12:57.239 --> 01:12:59.375
MANAGED CARE WERE 90% OF FULL

01:12:59.441 --> 01:13:00.676
SCOPE MEDI CAL AND RELEASE GET

01:13:00.743 --> 01:13:02.845
THEIR COVERAGE AND WHAT MIGHT

01:13:02.911 --> 01:13:04.513
CALIFORNIA DO DIFFERENTLY. TO

01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:05.814
ACCELERATE IMPROVEMENTS AND

01:13:05.881 --> 01:13:07.983
ACCESS TO CARE AND QUALITY FOR

01:13:08.050 --> 01:13:10.219
MEDI CAL AND WILLYS.

01:13:10.285 --> 01:13:11.653
THE FIRST WE KNOW THE QUALITY OF

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:12.287
CARE -- IT

01:13:12.354 --> 01:13:14.690
IS HIGHLY VARIABLE DEPENDING ON

01:13:14.757 --> 01:13:16.191
WHERE YOU LIVE WHAT PLAN YOU'RE

01:13:16.258 --> 01:13:17.326
ENROLLED IN IN YOUR RACE AND

01:13:17.392 --> 01:13:18.627
ETHNICITY.

01:13:18.694 --> 01:13:20.095
ACCORDING TO THE MEDI CAL

01:13:20.162 --> 01:13:21.797
MANAGED CARE DASHBOARD THAT'S

01:13:21.864 --> 01:13:23.699
PRODUCED QUARTERLY BY THE

01:13:23.766 --> 01:13:24.900
DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES.

01:13:24.967 --> 01:13:27.035
AGGREGATED SCORES OF QUALITY

01:13:27.102 --> 01:13:28.137
FREE TO THE HEALTH PLANS VARIES

01:13:28.203 --> 01:13:31.306
BY A FACTOR OF TWO AND A HALF.

01:13:31.373 --> 01:13:33.375
THESE AGGREGATE SCORES ROLL OUT

01:13:33.442 --> 01:13:35.310
SEVERAL QUALITY MEASURES. TO

01:13:35.377 --> 01:13:36.912
PROVIDE A SINGLE SNAPSHOT OF

01:13:36.979 --> 01:13:38.781
OVERALL QUALITY FOR EACH PLAN

01:13:38.847 --> 01:13:40.115
BUT MASK IMPORTANT.

01:13:40.182 --> 01:13:42.818
CLINICAL INSIGNIFICANT EXCUSE ME

01:13:42.885 --> 01:13:45.053
IMPORTANT DOT CLINICAL AND HUMAN

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:46.355
TOLL OF THE VARIATION. FOR

01:13:46.421 --> 01:13:48.957
EXAMPLE 74% OF WOMEN AND ROLLED

01:13:49.024 --> 01:13:50.325
IN SAN FRANCISCO HEALTH PLAN

01:13:50.392 --> 01:13:52.094
RECEIVED THEIR RECOMMENDED

01:13:52.161 --> 01:13:53.962
CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING.

01:13:54.029 --> 01:13:54.897
AMONG WOMEN ENROLLED IN HEALTH

01:13:54.963 --> 01:13:58.834
NET IN SAN DIEGO ONLY 41% DID.

01:13:58.901 --> 01:13:59.835
AMONG MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES

01:13:59.902 --> 01:14:01.436
WITH HYPERTENSION RESIDING IN

01:14:01.503 --> 01:14:03.939
THE INLAND EMPIRE 69% OF THOSE

01:14:04.006 --> 01:14:05.607
ENROLLED INLAND EMPIRE HEALTH

01:14:05.674 --> 01:14:07.142
PLAN HOW THEIR BLOOD PRESSURE

01:14:07.209 --> 01:14:08.377
ADDED WE CONTROLLED.

01:14:08.443 --> 01:14:10.746
WHEREAS LESS THAN 40% OF THOSE

01:14:10.813 --> 01:14:12.080
ENROLLED IN MOLINA HEALTH CARE

01:14:12.147 --> 01:14:13.615
DEAD SO THEY'RE NOT JUST YOU

01:14:13.682 --> 01:14:16.018
RAPID DISPARITIES EVEN WITHIN

01:14:16.084 --> 01:14:16.485
COUNTY FIND SOMEBODY'S

01:14:16.552 --> 01:14:18.353
DISPARITIES.

01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:19.421
THE DEPARTMENT ALSO FOUND

01:14:19.488 --> 01:14:20.122
DISPARITIES BY RACE AND

01:14:20.189 --> 01:14:21.757
ETHNICITY WITH BLACK IN NATIVE

01:14:21.824 --> 01:14:22.558
AMERICANS FREQUENTLY FARING

01:14:22.624 --> 01:14:23.759
WORSE THAN OTHER MEDI CAL

01:14:23.826 --> 01:14:25.527
BENEFICIARIES.

01:14:25.594 --> 01:14:27.663
SECOND WE ARE ALSO LEARNING THAT

01:14:27.729 --> 01:14:29.298
OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS QUALITY

01:14:29.364 --> 01:14:31.700
OF CARE HAS NOT IMPROVED PROGRAM

01:14:31.767 --> 01:14:34.269
LIED ON MOST QUALITY MEASURES.

01:14:34.336 --> 01:14:36.238
A STUDY BY UCSF RESEARCHERS THAT

01:14:36.305 --> 01:14:37.472
IS SOON TO BE PUBLISHED FINDS

01:14:37.539 --> 01:14:39.041
OUT OF FORTY ONE QUALITY

01:14:39.107 --> 01:14:40.542
MEASURES QUALITY AND PATIENT

01:14:40.609 --> 01:14:42.544
EXPERIENCE MEASURES COLLECTED

01:14:42.611 --> 01:14:43.478
AND REPORTED BY DIETZ YES.

01:14:43.545 --> 01:14:45.314
THERE'S BEEN SIGNIFICANT

01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:47.382
IMPROVEMENTS ON ONLY SIXTY

01:14:47.449 --> 01:14:48.917
ACROSS ALL MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE

01:14:48.984 --> 01:14:50.452
PLANS FOR TWENTY THERE'S BEEN

01:14:50.519 --> 01:14:52.621
LITTLE CHANGE AND FOR FIVE THESE

01:14:52.688 --> 01:14:53.622
MEASURES HAS ACTUALLY BEEN

01:14:53.689 --> 01:14:56.124
DECLINING QUALITY.

01:14:56.191 --> 01:14:57.759
SO HOW COULD THIS BE THERE ARE

01:14:57.826 --> 01:14:58.760
MANY POSSIBILITIES BUT I WOULD

01:14:58.827 --> 01:15:00.028
LIKE TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO

01:15:00.095 --> 01:15:02.064
TWO IN PARTICULAR.

01:15:02.130 --> 01:15:03.432
FIRST WEN A MEDI CAL AND

01:15:03.498 --> 01:15:04.633
MANAGED CARE PLAN MAKES

01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:06.702
INVESTMENTS TO IMPROVE THE

01:15:06.768 --> 01:15:09.304
QUALITY OF CARE FOR ITS MEMBERS.

01:15:09.371 --> 01:15:10.739
AND THESE INVESTMENTS ALSO LEAD

01:15:10.806 --> 01:15:12.674
TO MORE EFFICIENT AND LOWER COST

01:15:12.741 --> 01:15:14.943
CARE D. H. U. S. REDUCES WHAT IT

01:15:15.010 --> 01:15:16.478
PLAYS THE PLAN.

01:15:16.545 --> 01:15:18.247
IN THE NEXT RATE SETTING CYCLE.

01:15:18.313 --> 01:15:19.815
THIS PHENOMENON CALLEDPREMIUM

01:15:19.882 --> 01:15:21.316
SLIDE DISCOURAGES MANAGED CARE

01:15:21.383 --> 01:15:22.885
PLANS FOR MAKING LARGE

01:15:22.951 --> 01:15:24.286
INVESTMENTS AND SERVICES TO

01:15:24.353 --> 01:15:25.821
TOUCH SOCIAL DETERMINANTS LIKE

01:15:25.888 --> 01:15:26.755
HOUSING SUPPORT ARE MEDICALLY

01:15:26.822 --> 01:15:27.923
TAILORED MEALS.

01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:29.358
OR INVESTING TO EXPAND AND

01:15:29.424 --> 01:15:31.894
IMPROVE THE PROVIDER NETWORK.

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:32.661
AND FOR THOSE THAT DO YOU

01:15:32.728 --> 01:15:34.129
PREMIUMS SLIDE MAKES IT MORE

01:15:34.196 --> 01:15:37.065
DIFFICULT TO CAN YOU MAKING

01:15:37.132 --> 01:15:38.367
THESE INVESTMENTS OVER TIME.

01:15:38.433 --> 01:15:40.168
SECOND UNLIKE MOST OTHER METHODS

01:15:40.235 --> 01:15:41.069
GIVE ME UNLIKE MANY OTHER

01:15:41.136 --> 01:15:42.304
MANAGED CARE PROGRAMS.

01:15:42.371 --> 01:15:43.639
CALIFORNIA DOES NOT HAVE A

01:15:43.705 --> 01:15:45.474
FINANCIAL INCENTIVE PROGRAM FOR

01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:46.842
IT'S HEALTH PLAN THAT REWARDS

01:15:46.909 --> 01:15:48.243
PLANS WHEN THEY PROVIDE

01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:49.411
EXCELLENT QUALITY CARE OR

01:15:49.478 --> 01:15:51.113
IMPROVE.

01:15:51.179 --> 01:15:53.081
A QUALITY OVER TIME.

01:15:53.148 --> 01:15:54.516
SO WHAT MY CALIFORNIA DO

01:15:54.583 --> 01:15:55.517
DIFFERENTLY TO CATALYZE

01:15:55.584 --> 01:15:57.252
SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN

01:15:57.319 --> 01:15:58.520
ACCESS AND QUALITY FOR MEDI CAL

01:15:58.587 --> 01:16:00.555
ENROLLEES.

01:16:00.622 --> 01:16:01.423
TAKING THESE FACTORS INTO

01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:02.758
ACCOUNT AND HAFTER HEARING FROM

01:16:02.824 --> 01:16:04.426
A DIVERSE CROSS SECTION OF MEDI

01:16:04.493 --> 01:16:05.560
CAL STAKEHOLDERS THAT THEY

01:16:05.627 --> 01:16:06.895
SUPPORT A VISION OF SHARED

01:16:06.962 --> 01:16:09.097
ACCOUNTABILITY. TO PROVIDE HIGH

01:16:09.164 --> 01:16:10.165
QUALITY HIGH VALUE HOLE PERSON

01:16:10.232 --> 01:16:11.333
CARE.

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:12.367
THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE

01:16:12.434 --> 01:16:13.568
FOUNDATION LAUNCHED A PROJECT TO

01:16:13.635 --> 01:16:15.103
DESIGN A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE

01:16:15.170 --> 01:16:16.805
PROGRAM THAT WOULD ADDRESS THE

01:16:16.872 --> 01:16:18.040
PREMIUM SLIDE.

01:16:18.106 --> 01:16:19.574
ISSUE AND PROMOTE MORE RAPID

01:16:19.641 --> 01:16:21.276
QUALITY IMPROVEMENT.

01:16:21.343 --> 01:16:22.744
WE HIRED CITY MAN FORMER

01:16:22.811 --> 01:16:23.979
DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR

01:16:24.046 --> 01:16:25.580
MEDICAID AND CHIP SERVICES IN

01:16:25.647 --> 01:16:27.282
YOUR BOMB ADMINISTRATION AND

01:16:27.349 --> 01:16:29.451
ENGAGE IN ADVISORY GROUP THAT

HEALTH PLAN CEOS AND CFO'S.

01:16:32.354 --> 01:16:34.489
THERE EVER PRODUCED

01:16:34.556 --> 01:16:38.894
RECOMMENDATIONS FOREIGN PLAN

01:16:38.961 --> 01:16:41.229
IF IT MEETS THREE CRITERIA.

01:16:41.296 --> 01:16:42.931
FIRST A GENEROUS COST SAVINGS

01:16:42.998 --> 01:16:44.800
GREATER THAN A THRESHOLD

01:16:44.866 --> 01:16:46.401
ESTABLISHED BY THE DEPARTMENT

01:16:46.468 --> 01:16:47.936
AND ITS ACTUARIES.

01:16:48.003 --> 01:16:49.504
SECOND NEEDS QUALITY TARGETS

01:16:49.571 --> 01:16:50.906
BASED ON PROVIDING EXCELLENT

01:16:50.973 --> 01:16:52.407
QUALITY OF CARE OR DEMONSTRATING

01:16:52.474 --> 01:16:54.009
SIGNIFICANT QUALITY IMPROVEMENT.

01:16:54.076 --> 01:16:55.110
AND THREE IT DEMONSTRATES THAT

01:16:55.177 --> 01:16:56.211
IS INVESTING AT LEAST A

01:16:56.278 --> 01:16:58.046
SPECIFIED AMOUNT INTO HEALTH

01:16:58.113 --> 01:17:00.549
RELATED INVESTMENTS AS DEFINED

01:17:00.615 --> 01:17:01.817
BY THE STATE. ONE OF THE MAIN

01:17:01.883 --> 01:17:03.151
BENEFIT OF THIS APPROACH IS

01:17:03.218 --> 01:17:04.186
THAT IT WOULD NOT REQUIRE

01:17:04.252 --> 01:17:06.688
ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING.

01:17:06.755 --> 01:17:08.657
THIS APPROACH HOWEVER IS JUST

01:17:08.724 --> 01:17:09.958
ONE OF SEVERAL APPROACHES

01:17:10.025 --> 01:17:11.326
CALIFORNIA COULD TAKE IN TODAY

01:17:11.393 --> 01:17:12.627
THE FOUNDATION PUBLISHED A NEW

01:17:12.694 --> 01:17:14.363
REPORT DESCRIBES FIVE DIFFERENT

01:17:14.429 --> 01:17:15.530
TYPES OF FINANCIAL INCENTIVE

01:17:15.597 --> 01:17:16.732
PROGRAMS.

01:17:16.798 --> 01:17:18.233
I THINK YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU.

01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:19.901
THIS REPORT MAKING QUALITY

01:17:19.968 --> 01:17:21.169
MATTER MEDI CAL MANAGES CARE

01:17:21.236 --> 01:17:22.604
DESCRIBES EACH OF THESE FIVE

01:17:22.671 --> 01:17:25.140
APPROACHES AND FOR EACH PROVIDES

01:17:25.207 --> 01:17:26.508
AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THE STATE IS

01:17:26.575 --> 01:17:28.043
PUTTING.

01:17:28.110 --> 01:17:29.945
THIS APPROACH IN THE PRACTICE.

01:17:30.012 --> 01:17:31.113
SOME ARE SIMPLER TO ADMINISTER

01:17:31.179 --> 01:17:32.147
THAN OTHERS SOME WOULD REQUIRE

01:17:32.214 --> 01:17:33.315
ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING OR

01:17:33.382 --> 01:17:35.684
REALLOCATION OF EXISTING MEDICAL

01:17:35.751 --> 01:17:37.119
FUNDS.

01:17:37.185 --> 01:17:39.054
OF COURSE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES

01:17:39.121 --> 01:17:40.956
IN VALUE BASE PAY ARE NOT A

01:17:41.023 --> 01:17:44.059
PANACEA AND DH YES HAS AND USES

01:17:44.126 --> 01:17:45.761
MANY TOOLS IN ITS TOOL CHEST. TO

01:17:45.827 --> 01:17:48.663
MANAGE THE MANAGE CARE PROGRAM.

01:17:48.730 --> 01:17:49.831
PROCUREMENT CONTRACT MANAGEMENT

01:17:49.898 --> 01:17:51.066
AND OVERSIGHT PUBLIC PURPORTING

01:17:51.133 --> 01:17:52.667
TO NAME A FEW.

01:17:52.734 --> 01:17:53.869
LATER THIS SPRING WE WILL

01:17:53.935 --> 01:17:55.437
PUBLISH A REPORT THE PROVIDES

01:17:55.504 --> 01:17:56.571
RECOMMENDATIONS IN EACH OF THESE

01:17:56.638 --> 01:17:58.106
AREAS BASED ON A REVIEW OF

01:17:58.173 --> 01:17:59.808
PRACTICES BY DH CS COVER

01:17:59.875 --> 01:18:01.043
CALIFORNIA CALPERS.

01:18:01.109 --> 01:18:02.778
AND FIVE OTHER STATE MEDICAID

01:18:02.844 --> 01:18:03.912
PROGRAMS.

01:18:03.979 --> 01:18:05.847
LASTLY I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE

01:18:05.914 --> 01:18:08.617
H. YES AND IT'S PLAN PARTNERS.

FOR WORKING HARD TO IMPROVE

01:18:09.751 --> 01:18:11.887
QUALITY CARE FOR THEIR MEMBERS.

01:18:11.953 --> 01:18:13.855
AND THE SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS OF

01:18:13.922 --> 01:18:15.090
PLANTS ARE REFLECTED IN

01:18:15.157 --> 01:18:16.925
IMPROVEMENTS IN THEIR QUALITY

01:18:16.992 --> 01:18:18.593
SCORES OVER TIME.

01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:19.661
MOREOVER WHAT DH YES AND IT'S

01:18:19.728 --> 01:18:21.096
HEALTH PLANS HAVE ACCOMPLISHED

01:18:21.163 --> 01:18:22.898
IN JUST THE LAST SEVEN YEARS IS

01:18:22.964 --> 01:18:24.766
TRULY IMPRESSIVE AS A PROGRAM

01:18:24.833 --> 01:18:26.034
WAS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE MILLIONS

01:18:26.101 --> 01:18:27.035
OF NEW ENROLLEES.

01:18:27.102 --> 01:18:28.370
MANY WITH COMPLEX CHRONIC

01:18:28.437 --> 01:18:29.838
CONDITIONS OR TACKLING KEY

01:18:29.905 --> 01:18:31.573
PRIORITIES SUCH AS ADDING A NEW

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:33.708
MAP MILD TO MODERATE MENTAL

01:18:33.775 --> 01:18:35.710
HEALTH CONDITIONS.

01:18:35.777 --> 01:18:36.244
WITH STRONGER INCENTIVES

01:18:36.311 --> 01:18:37.612
INAPPROPRIATE FLEXIBILITY

01:18:37.679 --> 01:18:39.281
HOWEVER WE CAN AND SHOULD EXPECT

01:18:39.347 --> 01:18:40.615
BETTER OUTCOMES FROM A MEDICAID

01:18:40.682 --> 01:18:42.217
MANAGED CARE PROGRAM AS MANY

01:18:42.284 --> 01:18:44.352
STATES ALREADY DO.

I'LL BE HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR

ENTIRE PRETENCES SO THE BLOOD

BACK AND WHAT CAN WE DO. TO TO

01:19:35.737 --> 01:19:37.005
MAKE.

01:19:37.072 --> 01:19:37.939
GET RID OF THIS --

01:19:38.006 --> 01:19:39.908
TERRIBLE POLICY --

THAT.

01:19:42.410 --> 01:19:44.579
PROVIDES EIGHTY ANTI INCENTIVE

01:19:44.646 --> 01:19:47.449
FOR PREVENTIVE CARE --

OFFERS A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT

01:19:50.118 --> 01:19:51.019
OPTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO

01:19:51.086 --> 01:19:52.387
THE STATE AND HAS --

01:19:52.454 --> 01:19:53.889
THE REPORT INDICATES OTHER

01:19:53.955 --> 01:19:57.459
STATES TEXAS FLORIDA NEW YORK --

01:19:57.526 --> 01:19:58.727
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA ARE

01:19:58.793 --> 01:20:00.128
EMPLOYING THESE TYPES OF

01:20:00.195 --> 01:20:01.630
FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR HEALTH

01:20:01.696 --> 01:20:02.531
PLANS.

01:20:02.597 --> 01:20:03.965
MANY OF THESE MODELS WOULD

01:20:04.032 --> 01:20:05.700
ADDRESS THE PREMIUMS LIKE NOT

01:20:05.767 --> 01:20:06.601
ALL OF THEM.

01:20:06.668 --> 01:20:08.470
AS A SAID SOME WOULD COST THE

01:20:08.537 --> 01:20:10.605
STATE SOME MORE MONEY BUT THERE

01:20:10.672 --> 01:20:11.740
ARE TRADE OFFS TEAM MADE IN

01:20:11.806 --> 01:20:14.376
TERMS OF COMPLEXITY VERSUS COST --

01:20:14.442 --> 01:20:15.210
BUT THERE ARE THERE ARE

01:20:15.277 --> 01:20:16.811
APPROACHES THAT ARE BEING USED

01:20:16.878 --> 01:20:19.447
IN THE FIELD AND AND THE REPORTS

01:20:19.514 --> 01:20:21.116
TO BE PRODUCED OFFER SOME SOME

01:20:21.183 --> 01:20:22.083
OPTIONS THERE I'M SURE THOSE

01:20:22.150 --> 01:20:23.919
HIGHER COSTS OR NOT GOING TO BE

01:20:23.985 --> 01:20:25.487
IN COMPARISON TO THE INVESTMENT

01:20:25.554 --> 01:20:26.388
IS MADE IN THE FRONT AND A WHAT

01:20:26.454 --> 01:20:27.489
THE PLANS ARE.

01:20:27.556 --> 01:20:28.690
GONNA HAVE TO PAY AND THE AND

01:20:28.757 --> 01:20:30.292
THE BACK AND WHEN SOMEBODY HAS

01:20:30.358 --> 01:20:31.793
AN CONTROLLED --

01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:33.261
BLOOD PRESSURE ENDS UP IN A

01:20:33.328 --> 01:20:34.829
HOSPITAL WITH A STROKER OF A

01:20:34.896 --> 01:20:35.931
HEART ATTACK THE COULD HAVE BEEN

01:20:35.997 --> 01:20:37.432
PREVENTED THROUGH REGULAR

01:20:37.499 --> 01:20:38.967
MONITORING AND A LITTLE BIT OF

01:20:39.034 --> 01:20:40.435
AN INVESTMENT.

01:20:40.502 --> 01:20:41.403
SO -- YOU

01:20:41.469 --> 01:20:42.470
KNOW I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING

01:20:42.537 --> 01:20:43.872
WITH THE CHAIR AND FINDING OUT

01:20:43.939 --> 01:20:46.241
WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN --

01:20:46.308 --> 01:20:48.543
ELIMINATE THIS TERRIBLE POLICY

01:20:48.610 --> 01:20:50.245
AND EMBRACE MAYBE SOME OF THE

01:20:50.312 --> 01:20:53.982
SUCCESSES AND OTHER STATES OF

01:20:54.049 --> 01:20:57.385
HAND.

01:20:57.452 --> 01:20:59.087
AND I JUST WANNA FOLLOW UP ON

01:20:59.154 --> 01:21:00.422
WHAT CENTER STONES AND I'VE MET

01:21:00.488 --> 01:21:01.022
THAT I ACTUALLY --

01:21:01.089 --> 01:21:01.923
FORTUNATELY WAS AWARE OF THE

01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:03.358
PREMIUM SLIDE I'VE HAD

01:21:03.425 --> 01:21:05.293
CONVERSATIONS WITH DIRECTOR TENT

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:08.964
AND A DRUG CAN'T WELL --

01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:09.431
ABOUT --

01:21:09.497 --> 01:21:10.198
THIS -- I

01:21:10.265 --> 01:21:11.366
WAS TOLD THAT SOME OF THIS HAS

01:21:11.433 --> 01:21:14.603
TO DO IS SEE CURIOUS AS TO HOW

01:21:14.669 --> 01:21:17.138
THE OTHER STATES DO IT IF CMS IS

01:21:17.205 --> 01:21:18.740
THE REASON WE CAN'T.

01:21:18.807 --> 01:21:19.841
KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE THOSE

01:21:19.908 --> 01:21:21.409
ADJUSTMENTS.

01:21:21.476 --> 01:21:22.844
BECAUSE IT'S YOU KNOW THERE'S A

01:21:22.911 --> 01:21:23.678
FEDERAL MATCH INVOLVED FOR MEDI

01:21:23.745 --> 01:21:25.513
CAL. FOR MEDICAID --

01:21:25.580 --> 01:21:28.116
HOW HOW THIS TAXES OR THE OTHER

01:21:28.183 --> 01:21:29.384
STATES HAVE FORTUNATE CHANCE TO

01:21:29.451 --> 01:21:30.652
REACH YOUR FULL REPORT BUT?

01:21:30.719 --> 01:21:31.920
I MEAN IS IS THERE A FEDERAL

01:21:31.987 --> 01:21:34.456
BARRIER TO BE ABLE TO SAY WELL

01:21:34.522 --> 01:21:35.924
YOU KNOW OKAY SO WHIMS WE MADE

01:21:35.991 --> 01:21:37.025
INVESTMENT WE IMPROVE OUR

01:21:37.092 --> 01:21:38.526
DIABETES CARE NOW THAT THE

01:21:38.593 --> 01:21:40.662
SPENDING DROPPED IS THE FED'S GO

01:21:40.729 --> 01:21:42.130
BACK AND SAY WELL BECAUSE WE PAY

01:21:42.197 --> 01:21:42.897
HALF OF THAT.

01:21:42.964 --> 01:21:45.400
WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET YOU YOU

01:21:45.467 --> 01:21:47.535
KNOW WE WERE GOING TO PAY LESS I

01:21:47.602 --> 01:21:49.137
MEAN THE TWENTY OUT OF CAN YOU

01:21:49.204 --> 01:21:50.805
PERHAPS SHED SOME LIGHT ON THE

01:21:50.872 --> 01:21:52.073
ROLE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:21:52.140 --> 01:21:53.541
PLAYS AND CMS PLAYS GIVEN THE

01:21:53.608 --> 01:21:55.944
FACT THAT MEDICAID IS A FIFTY

01:21:56.011 --> 01:21:56.778
FIFTY WITH --

01:21:56.845 --> 01:21:58.013
LEASE FOR US FIFTY FIFTY

01:21:58.079 --> 01:21:58.747
SUPPOSED STATE TO GET BETTER

01:21:58.813 --> 01:22:01.116
FEDERAL MATCH FOR US IN TERMS OF

01:22:01.182 --> 01:22:03.585
MUST BE ABLE.

01:22:03.652 --> 01:22:04.653
TO ADDRESS THE PREMIUM SLIDING

01:22:04.719 --> 01:22:06.554
PROVIDE POSITIVE SENATOR PEOPLE

01:22:06.621 --> 01:22:08.556
FOR PLANS AND OTHERS WHO ARE

01:22:08.623 --> 01:22:10.025
INNOVATING WHO.

01:22:10.091 --> 01:22:11.026
WELL IT --

01:22:11.092 --> 01:22:12.994
THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS AND

01:22:13.061 --> 01:22:18.667
CAN FEDERAL POLICY IS --

01:22:18.733 --> 01:22:22.237
EVOLVING FORGE THAT ARE GIVING

01:22:22.304 --> 01:22:23.772
STATES FLEXIBILITY --

01:22:23.838 --> 01:22:26.308
TO TACKLE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF

01:22:26.374 --> 01:22:27.309
HEALTH --

01:22:27.375 --> 01:22:29.411
HIGH SO IT REALLY DEPENDS ON HOW

01:22:29.477 --> 01:22:30.679
YOU APPROACH TO MODEL --

01:22:30.745 --> 01:22:32.347
THERE ARE SOME --

01:22:32.414 --> 01:22:33.648
APPROACHES THAT --

01:22:33.715 --> 01:22:35.317
DIRECTLY TACKLE --

01:22:35.383 --> 01:22:36.384
THINGS LIKE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS

01:22:36.451 --> 01:22:39.654
THAT DO REQUIRE FEDERAL WAIVERS --

01:22:39.721 --> 01:22:41.189
THIS IS A HARD TIME TO BE

01:22:41.256 --> 01:22:42.757
REQUESTING FEDERAL WAIVERS THERE

01:22:42.824 --> 01:22:43.625
ARE OTHER PROCEDURES THAT ARE

01:22:43.692 --> 01:22:45.193
WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF WHAT STATE

ABOUT THE PORTS OF ALIGNMENT AND

01:23:12.287 --> 01:23:13.221
SO.

01:23:13.288 --> 01:23:14.456
WE DON'T THINK ABOUT MEDI CAL

01:23:14.522 --> 01:23:15.990
THE SYSTEM OVER HERE AND

01:23:16.057 --> 01:23:17.492

YOU'VE OKAY GOOD --

01:23:23.365 --> 01:23:24.299
SO AND I KNOW THE CALIFORNIA

01:23:24.366 --> 01:23:26.000
HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION DOES A LOT

01:23:26.067 --> 01:23:27.502
OF WORK NOT ONLY WITH MEDI CAL

01:23:27.569 --> 01:23:29.337
BUT ALSO PRIVATE.

01:23:29.404 --> 01:23:30.238
I MEAN WHO WHO IS YOUR

01:23:30.305 --> 01:23:32.006
PERSPECTIVE FORTY OPPORTUNITIES

01:23:32.073 --> 01:23:34.743
AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS IT FOR

01:23:34.809 --> 01:23:35.276
MEDI CAL.

01:23:35.343 --> 01:23:36.444
IS A PAIR THAT COVERS A THIRD OF

01:23:36.511 --> 01:23:39.013
ALL CALIFORNIANS TO ALSO BE IN

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:41.049
THE SAME ALIGNMENT AS OUR

01:23:41.116 --> 01:23:42.717
PRIVATE SECTOR PARTNERS ARE A

01:23:42.784 --> 01:23:43.785
PART OF HERS AND ARMS COVERED

01:23:43.852 --> 01:23:45.920
CALIFORNIA AND AND AND AND OTHER

01:23:45.987 --> 01:23:47.288
PRIVATE PURCHASING GROUPS.

01:23:47.355 --> 01:23:52.927

01:23:52.994 --> 01:23:54.396
TO TO ACTUALLY YOUNG FRATELLI

01:23:54.462 --> 01:23:55.163
BASED PAYMENT AND BEND THE COST

01:23:55.230 --> 01:23:58.400
CURVE OVERALL FOR THE STATE'S.

01:23:58.466 --> 01:24:01.603
MAIL PIZZA DOES TO WHAT DEGREE

01:24:01.669 --> 01:24:04.072
SHOULD THE M. AND WE NEED THIS

01:24:04.139 --> 01:24:05.473
MEDI CAL NEED TO BE LINED UP

01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:08.710
WITH EVERYONE ELSE SO THAT

01:24:08.777 --> 01:24:10.278
INSTEAD OF BEING A PROGRAM APART.

01:24:10.345 --> 01:24:11.613
WELL IT IS --

01:24:11.679 --> 01:24:12.881
I THINK IT'S ALIGNMENT --

01:24:12.947 --> 01:24:14.482
GREATER LINE IT IS CRITICALLY

01:24:14.549 --> 01:24:15.417
IMPORTANT IT'S REALLY ESSENTIAL

01:24:15.483 --> 01:24:16.551
FOR GONNA MOVE --

01:24:16.618 --> 01:24:20.088
THAT DELIVERY SYSTEM FORWARD --

01:24:20.155 --> 01:24:24.058
TO REALLY ALL CALIFORNIANS --

01:24:24.125 --> 01:24:26.027
ME NO MEDI CAL IS A UNIQUE

01:24:26.094 --> 01:24:27.228
PROGRAM IS A UNIQUE COVERAGE

01:24:27.295 --> 01:24:28.430
PROGRAM THAT COVERS MANY

01:24:28.496 --> 01:24:30.832
POPULATIONS THAT OTHER SOURCES

01:24:30.899 --> 01:24:31.900
OF COVERAGE AND DO NOT --

01:24:31.966 --> 01:24:33.535
SO I THINK WE HAVE TO BE MINDFUL

01:24:33.601 --> 01:24:34.702
OF SOME OF THE UNIQUE ATTRIBUTES

01:24:34.769 --> 01:24:36.037
OF SOME OF THE MEDI CAL AND

01:24:36.104 --> 01:24:38.039
MEDICAID IN GENERAL AND YET

01:24:38.106 --> 01:24:39.474
THERE ARE IN ORDER FOR NORMA'S

01:24:39.541 --> 01:24:40.141
OPPORTUNITIES FOR GREATER

01:24:40.208 --> 01:24:41.676
ALIGNMENT --

01:24:41.743 --> 01:24:42.577
ONE OF THE EFFORTS THAT WE'RE

01:24:42.644 --> 01:24:44.913
INVOLVED IN IS EXPANDING ACCESS

01:24:44.979 --> 01:24:46.514
TO TELL HEALTH PARTICULARLY IN

01:24:46.581 --> 01:24:48.850
RURAL AREAS OF THE STATE TO TRY

01:24:48.917 --> 01:24:50.151
TO ADDRESS SOME OF THAT --

01:24:50.218 --> 01:24:51.619
MILLION DOLLARS NETWORK ISSUES

01:24:51.686 --> 01:24:53.488
SURE SHORTAGES OF PHYSICIANS

01:24:53.555 --> 01:24:54.022
PARTICIPATING IN MEDICARE

01:24:54.088 --> 01:24:54.589
PROGRAM --

01:24:54.656 --> 01:24:56.024
AND WHAT WE FIND IS EVEN WHEN

01:24:56.090 --> 01:24:57.659
THERE IS A PLAN THAT IS VERY

01:24:57.725 --> 01:24:58.993
COMMITTED --

01:24:59.060 --> 01:25:00.628
INCLUDING SOME PLANS THAT ARE

01:25:00.695 --> 01:25:02.997
HERE TODAY TO EXPANDING ACCESS

01:25:03.064 --> 01:25:04.966
TO TELL HEALTH IT TAKES MORE

01:25:05.033 --> 01:25:06.835
THAN ONE PLAN THAT'S COMMITTED --

01:25:06.901 --> 01:25:08.136
THAT PROVIDERS THAT THEY'RE

01:25:08.203 --> 01:25:09.170
WORKING WITH --

01:25:09.237 --> 01:25:10.972
AS YOU'VE HEARD --

01:25:11.039 --> 01:25:12.674
AND HAS BEEN YOUR EXPERIENCE.

01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:14.209
REALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:25:14.275 --> 01:25:15.477
ALL OF THE PLANS THAT THEY'RE

01:25:15.543 --> 01:25:17.178
WORKING WITH OUR SORT OF ROWING

01:25:17.245 --> 01:25:18.379
IN SYNC SO THE NOT GETTING

01:25:18.446 --> 01:25:20.482
DIFFERENT CENTERS OR SOME PLANS

01:25:20.548 --> 01:25:21.816
ARE PLAYING FOR THINGS AND SOME

01:25:21.883 --> 01:25:23.384
PLANS AREN'T SO.

01:25:23.451 --> 01:25:24.352
GREATER IN LYMAN WHETHER IT'S IN

01:25:24.419 --> 01:25:25.854
PAYMENT OR WHETHER IT'S IN --

01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:27.021
INCENTIVE PROGRAMS IN VALUE

01:25:27.088 --> 01:25:31.459
BASED PAYMENT IS --

01:25:31.526 --> 01:25:33.194
IS CRITICAL.

01:25:33.261 --> 01:25:38.266
THANK YOU AND A SO AS TO THEM --

01:25:38.333 --> 01:25:40.468
TOOK QUITE CONCERNED ABOUT DOES

01:25:40.535 --> 01:25:42.136
YOUR FINDING THAT THERE'S LACK

01:25:42.203 --> 01:25:43.872
OF IMPROVEMENT AND THE

01:25:43.938 --> 01:25:45.640
PERFORMANCE I MEAN QUALITY

01:25:45.707 --> 01:25:47.008
PERFORMANCES BEEN.

01:25:47.075 --> 01:25:49.210
DONE.

01:25:49.277 --> 01:25:50.612
THE SUM UP SOME DOWN BUT

01:25:50.678 --> 01:25:51.746
GENERALLY THERE HASN'T.

01:25:51.813 --> 01:25:53.181
BEEN A PROVEN OVER TIME SO I

01:25:53.248 --> 01:25:54.215
THINK TO ME THAT'S PRETTY

01:25:54.282 --> 01:25:55.717
CONCERNING --

01:25:55.783 --> 01:25:56.251
WHEN I WAS JEERED SOMEBODY

01:25:56.317 --> 01:25:57.385
HEALTH COMMITTEE?

01:25:57.452 --> 01:25:59.120
WE MADE THAT THAT MEDI CAL PLANS

01:25:59.187 --> 01:26:00.722
ON THE CAPS SURVEY GENTLY

01:26:00.788 --> 01:26:04.025
PERFORM THOSE COMMERCIAL PLANS

01:26:04.092 --> 01:26:05.260
ARE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THREE AND

01:26:05.326 --> 01:26:06.828
FIVE BUT THE MOST THE MEDICAL

01:26:06.895 --> 01:26:07.896
PLANS WERE WANTS.

01:26:07.962 --> 01:26:09.664
TO AND THAT WAS VERY CONCERNING

01:26:09.731 --> 01:26:11.366
AS WELL AND SO --

01:26:11.432 --> 01:26:13.735
I THINK SOME OF THE THINGS THAT --

01:26:13.801 --> 01:26:14.903
NOW IF YOU HAVE SOME THOUGHTS AT

01:26:14.969 --> 01:26:15.770
IN TERMS OF AND I KNOW WE'RE

01:26:15.837 --> 01:26:16.538
GOING TO HAVE SOME --

01:26:16.604 --> 01:26:17.972
SOME OUTSTANDING PLANTS

01:26:18.039 --> 01:26:20.141
PRESENTING BUT THE YOU KNOW IT'S

01:26:20.208 --> 01:26:22.210
GREAT TO TALK ABOUT THE BEST BUT

01:26:22.277 --> 01:26:23.144
WE'D FATHER BUT FROM EQUITY

01:26:23.211 --> 01:26:24.445
STANDPOINT EVERYONE SHOULD BE AT

01:26:24.512 --> 01:26:25.213
THAT LEVEL.

01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:26.781
SO WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS

01:26:26.848 --> 01:26:28.316
PERHAPS THAT YOUR THOUGHTS THAT

01:26:28.383 --> 01:26:30.051
MEDI CAL SHOULD BE DOING TO MOVE

01:26:30.118 --> 01:26:32.754
THE PLANS THAT MIGHT BE IN THE

01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:34.022
MIDDLE OR BOTTOM.

01:26:34.088 --> 01:26:35.657
UP TO A HIGHER STANDARD.

01:26:35.723 --> 01:26:36.591
WELL I THINK --

01:26:36.658 --> 01:26:37.859
I THINK YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT --

01:26:37.926 --> 01:26:39.527
AS WE LOOK AT THE QUALITY AND

01:26:39.594 --> 01:26:40.728
PATIENT EXPERIENCE SCORES THERE

01:26:40.795 --> 01:26:42.096
ARE PLANS THAT ARE DOING A

01:26:42.163 --> 01:26:44.766
TREMENDOUS JOB AND HAVE IMPROVED --

01:26:44.832 --> 01:26:46.834
EITHER SCORES FOR INDIVIDUAL

01:26:46.901 --> 01:26:49.637
QUALITY MEASURES OR IN AGGREGATE

01:26:49.704 --> 01:26:51.339
THEY'VE MOVE THOSE FORWARD --

01:26:51.406 --> 01:26:52.707
AND YET --

01:26:52.774 --> 01:26:54.442
DAY ARE PERHAPS MORE THE

01:26:54.509 --> 01:26:56.844
EXCEPTION THAN THE RULE --

01:26:56.911 --> 01:27:00.315
AND IN THE APPROACH THAT WE CAME

01:27:00.381 --> 01:27:01.316
TO AGAIN LOOKING AROUND OTHER

01:27:01.382 --> 01:27:06.220
STATES IS THE NOTION OF WE NEED.

01:27:06.287 --> 01:27:08.022
TO AS WE SEE MANY PLANS.

01:27:08.089 --> 01:27:09.023
OPERATING PAY FOR PERFORMANCE

01:27:09.090 --> 01:27:10.258
AND OTHER VALUE BASED PROGRAMS

01:27:10.325 --> 01:27:11.593
WITH THEIR PROVIDERS --

01:27:11.659 --> 01:27:13.695
IT'S PERHAPS TIME TO THE STATE

01:27:13.761 --> 01:27:15.196
TO DO THE SAME --

01:27:15.263 --> 01:27:16.598
REALLY WANTS TO SEE BIGGER

01:27:16.664 --> 01:27:18.700
IMPROVEMENTS IN QUALITY AND AND

01:27:18.766 --> 01:27:19.834
PATIENT ACCESS.

01:27:19.901 --> 01:27:21.002
NEEDS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

01:27:21.069 --> 01:27:22.537
INCENTIVES ARE LINED WITH THOSE

01:27:22.604 --> 01:27:25.673
WITH THOSE CALLS.

01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:28.843
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS HERE.

01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:31.980
ADDITION CENTERS THEM.

01:27:32.046 --> 01:27:33.314
THE JUDGES TO FOLLOW UP ON ON

01:27:33.381 --> 01:27:35.149
SENATOR HANDS --

01:27:35.216 --> 01:27:37.418
A COMMENTS ABOUT THE IMPROVING

01:27:37.485 --> 01:27:40.555
KAREN AND MEDI CAL SHE IN RURAL

01:27:40.622 --> 01:27:42.423
AREAS IS CHALLENGING.

01:27:42.490 --> 01:27:43.925
AND IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S A

01:27:43.992 --> 01:27:44.726
CHALLENGE BECAUSE A LOT OF

01:27:44.792 --> 01:27:46.127
PROVIDERS JUST WON'T TAKE MEDI

01:27:46.194 --> 01:27:48.296
CAL BECAUSE THE FEES ARE JUST

01:27:48.363 --> 01:27:50.064
RIDICULOUSLY LOW.

01:27:50.131 --> 01:27:51.833
SO WOULD YOU SEE AN ACCESS TO

01:27:51.899 --> 01:27:54.035
THE THE FEES THAT ARE PAID AND

01:27:54.102 --> 01:27:55.703
MEDIC HOW WORK WERE FOR MORE

01:27:55.770 --> 01:27:56.738
PROBABLY TO FEE FOR SERVICE NOW

01:27:56.804 --> 01:27:57.772
ALTHOUGH I'M SURE THE MANAGED

01:27:57.839 --> 01:27:58.573
CARE.

01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:00.141
ALEXI A LARGER CAPITATED A

01:28:00.208 --> 01:28:01.376
BUDGET AS WELL.

01:28:01.442 --> 01:28:03.745
BUT DO YOU SEE AN ACCESS TO THE

01:28:03.811 --> 01:28:06.047
THE FEE AND THEY QUALITY OF CARE

01:28:06.114 --> 01:28:07.448
THIS DELIVERED I'M SORRY DO I

01:28:07.515 --> 01:28:08.983
SEE A WHITE TO THE NEXUS BETWEEN

01:28:09.050 --> 01:28:11.119
THE MEDI CAL FEE PAID FOR FEE

01:28:11.185 --> 01:28:13.054
FOR SERVICE AND THE AND THE AND

01:28:13.121 --> 01:28:17.525
THE LOWER RATINGS IF YOU WILL OF

01:28:17.592 --> 01:28:17.925
SERVICE OF PEOPLE.

WELL --

01:28:20.695 --> 01:28:22.497
THAT'S A THAT'S EIGHT IT'S A

01:28:22.563 --> 01:28:23.264
DIFFICULT QUESTION TO ANSWER I

01:28:23.331 --> 01:28:24.298
THINK WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS IN

01:28:24.365 --> 01:28:24.866
THE PAST WHEN MEDI CAL WAS

01:28:24.932 --> 01:28:27.802
MOSTLY A FEE FOR SERVICE PROGRAM --

01:28:27.869 --> 01:28:29.504
AND WE LOOKED AT NATIONALLY AT

01:28:29.570 --> 01:28:30.838
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

01:28:30.905 --> 01:28:33.174
MEDICAID FEE FOR SERVICE RATES

01:28:33.241 --> 01:28:35.009
AND MEASURES OF ACCESS --

01:28:35.076 --> 01:28:35.810
THERE IS DEFINITELY A

01:28:35.877 --> 01:28:37.545
RELATIONSHIP THERE INSTANCE

01:28:37.612 --> 01:28:39.213
STATED GENERALLY TO PAY LOWER

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:41.149
AXIS IS POOR AND STATES THAT PAY

01:28:41.215 --> 01:28:44.252
BETTER ACCESS IS THAT TENDS TO

01:28:44.318 --> 01:28:45.319
BE BETTER --

01:28:45.386 --> 01:28:46.254
YOU KNOW THE CHALLENGES IT MEDI

01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:48.456
CAL IS PREDOMINATELY A MANAGED

01:28:48.523 --> 01:28:52.326
CARE PROGRAM AND PAYMENTS TO

01:28:57.231 --> 01:28:58.700
IS IS ABSURD BEHIND A FIREWALL

01:28:58.766 --> 01:29:00.201
RIGHT IS WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE

01:29:00.268 --> 01:29:01.235
PUBLIC INFORMATION WHAT THE

01:29:01.302 --> 01:29:03.404

MEDI CAL FEE FOR SERVICE RATES

01:29:08.943 --> 01:29:10.511
OFTEN IN EXCESS OF WHAT MEDICARE

01:29:10.578 --> 01:29:12.346

01:29:12.413 --> 01:29:13.681
ENSURE THAT THEIR NET THEIR

01:29:13.748 --> 01:29:15.717
MEMBERS HAVE APPROPRIATE ACCESS

01:29:15.783 --> 01:29:17.652
TO CARE ON SOMETIMES THEY WILL

01:29:17.719 --> 01:29:19.020
SAY EVEN THAT'S NOT ENOUGH TIME

01:29:19.087 --> 01:29:19.654
TO GET --

01:29:19.721 --> 01:29:21.355
THE PHYSICIANS TO PARTICIPATE IN

GOOD DATA NOW TODAY IN THE IN

01:29:28.196 --> 01:29:30.264
THE IN THE WAY THE PROGRAM WORKS --

01:29:30.331 --> 01:29:31.566
IT'S NOT ONLY THAT IS NOT

01:29:31.632 --> 01:29:33.534
TRANSPARENCY THAT MANY POSITION

01:29:33.601 --> 01:29:34.469
GROUPS ARE CAPITATED SO THERE

01:29:34.535 --> 01:29:35.570
ISN'T A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP

01:29:35.636 --> 01:29:37.505
BETWEEN A SERVICE AND A PAYMENT

01:29:37.572 --> 01:29:38.673

WHEN I WAKE UP EACH MORNING TO

THINKING ABOUT IS HOW TO IMPROVE

01:34:00.801 --> 01:34:03.237
WHAT ARE THE MECHANISMS THAT THE

01:34:03.304 --> 01:34:04.271
AYE AYE IS A?

01:34:04.338 --> 01:34:06.173
AS A HEALTH PLAN A FAMILY

01:34:12.646 --> 01:34:13.647
NETWORK.

01:34:13.714 --> 01:34:15.883
AND AND SO I'VE IN MY WRITTEN

01:34:15.950 --> 01:34:17.518
TESTIMONY OF SUMMARIZE SOME OF

01:34:17.585 --> 01:34:19.453
THE MAJOR POINTS OF OF THAT I'VE

01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:20.955
LEARNED OVER THE YEARS BUT THEY

01:34:21.022 --> 01:34:22.456
THEY'RE IN FOUR CATEGORIES ON

01:34:22.523 --> 01:34:23.858
THE FIRST IS --

01:34:23.924 --> 01:34:25.192
THE LEVELS AT WHICH THE

01:34:25.259 --> 01:34:26.761
DIFFERENT A DIFFERENT LEVELS IN

01:34:26.827 --> 01:34:27.395
WHICH THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY

01:34:27.461 --> 01:34:28.863
SYSTEM CAN IMPACT CHRONIC

01:34:28.929 --> 01:34:30.297
DISEASE CARE --

01:34:30.364 --> 01:34:32.033
THE SECOND IS --

01:34:32.099 --> 01:34:34.602
LOOKING AT THE DOMAINS OF

01:34:34.668 --> 01:34:36.604
QUALITY THAT THAT CAN BE

01:34:36.670 --> 01:34:37.805
AFFECTED AND REALLY A LOT OF OUR

01:34:37.872 --> 01:34:39.673
CONVERSATIONS IS FOCUSING ON

01:34:39.740 --> 01:34:40.574
JUST A SUBGROUP OF THOSE TO

01:34:40.641 --> 01:34:41.909
MAYES WE'VE KIND OF TOUCH

01:34:41.976 --> 01:34:43.544
BRIEFLY ON THINGS LIKE CAPS AND

01:34:43.611 --> 01:34:44.678
AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS BUT

01:34:44.745 --> 01:34:46.380
THERE ARE THERE EVEN MORE THAN

01:34:46.447 --> 01:34:47.748
WHAT WE PRODUCT --

01:34:47.815 --> 01:34:49.950
THERE'S ALSO THE LEVERS ON FOR

01:34:50.017 --> 01:34:51.519
ACTUALLY CHANGING BEHAVIOR TO

IMPROVE QUALITY AND I WILL JUST --

01:34:53.854 --> 01:34:54.655
AND I'LL --

01:34:54.722 --> 01:34:56.690
I'LL JUST SAY THAT OF THE THE

01:34:56.757 --> 01:34:58.125
SEVEN MAJOR LEVERS FIRM FOR

01:34:58.192 --> 01:34:59.460
CHANGING BEHAVIOR --

01:34:59.527 --> 01:35:00.628
PAY FOR PERFORMANCE IS PROBABLY

01:35:00.694 --> 01:35:02.363
THE THIRD WORST IT'S NOT THE NOT

01:35:02.430 --> 01:35:07.134
NOT THE BEST ONE ITS INTEREST

01:35:07.201 --> 01:35:09.170
THERE OTHER STRONGER ONES.

01:35:09.236 --> 01:35:10.171
AND THEN LASTLY JUST A FEW

01:35:10.237 --> 01:35:11.372
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES FOR THE

01:35:11.439 --> 01:35:12.740

IN IMPROVEMENT.

01:36:10.598 --> 01:36:12.032
THERE OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT WE

DO WITH FOR INSTANCE I'M I'M

01:36:37.391 --> 01:36:38.259
FIVE DRAWING UPON --

01:36:38.325 --> 01:36:39.660
VACCINES AS AN EXAMPLE --

01:36:39.727 --> 01:36:41.295
TRAININGS ON WHAT WE LEARNED FOR

01:36:41.362 --> 01:36:43.230
BEST PRACTICES THAT PRACTICES

01:36:43.297 --> 01:36:44.798
MIGHT DO TO CHANGE THE THE

01:36:44.865 --> 01:36:46.700
LANGUAGE AROUND VACCINATION FOR

01:36:46.767 --> 01:36:47.902
EXAMPLE --

01:36:47.968 --> 01:36:49.136
PROVIDING COMPARATIVE DATE IS A

01:36:49.203 --> 01:36:50.804
POWERFUL A TOOL WHERE YOU

01:36:50.871 --> 01:36:51.839
ACTUALLY --

01:36:51.906 --> 01:36:53.374
LET ALL A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT

01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:54.742
PROVIDERS SEE HOW THEY COMPARE

01:36:54.808 --> 01:36:56.110
WITH EACH OTHER THE LOWER

01:36:56.177 --> 01:36:57.811
PROVIDERS CAN ASK THE HIGHER

01:36:57.878 --> 01:36:58.445
PROVIDERS WHERE THEY DO

01:36:58.512 --> 01:36:59.880
DIFFERENTLY MAYBE FEEL A LITTLE

01:36:59.947 --> 01:37:01.282
EMBARRASSED BIKE AT THAT SOCIAL

01:37:01.348 --> 01:37:02.716
PRESSURE WHICH IS THE TOP METHOD

01:37:02.783 --> 01:37:04.952
OF CHANGING BEHAVIOR --

01:37:05.019 --> 01:37:06.787
AND TO BRING THAT TO BEAR AND

01:37:06.854 --> 01:37:07.988
THEN THERE ARE SOME DIRECT TO

01:37:08.055 --> 01:37:09.456
MEMBER ACTIVITIES THAT HEALTH

01:37:09.523 --> 01:37:11.091
PLANS MADE DUE TO TO INFLUENCE

01:37:11.158 --> 01:37:12.059
AT SOME OF THE ONES WE'VE DONE

01:37:12.126 --> 01:37:12.760
AROUND --

01:37:12.826 --> 01:37:14.094
VACCINATIONS AS AN EXAMPLE

01:37:14.161 --> 01:37:16.730
INCLUDE MEMBER INCENTIVES FOR

01:37:16.797 --> 01:37:17.731
FOR COMPLETING VACCINATIONS ARE

01:37:17.798 --> 01:37:22.369
WELL CHILD VISITS --

01:37:22.436 --> 01:37:23.003
A MARKETING CAMPAIGN WERE RE --

01:37:23.070 --> 01:37:26.106
TALK --

01:37:26.173 --> 01:37:28.108
BROADER MEDIA CAMPAIGN TO KIND

01:37:28.175 --> 01:37:30.010
OF CREATE A MESSAGE THAT DOESN'T

01:37:30.077 --> 01:37:31.478
TURN OFF --

01:37:31.545 --> 01:37:32.846
A PARENTS WHO WERE CONSIDERING

01:37:32.913 --> 01:37:33.847
NOT VACCINATE THEIR CHILDREN BUT

01:37:33.914 --> 01:37:34.615
TO GIVE THEM --

01:37:34.682 --> 01:37:35.883
THE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

01:37:35.950 --> 01:37:37.418
TO MAYBE TO MAYBE START TO

01:37:37.484 --> 01:37:38.919
CHANGE OUR MINDS.

01:37:38.986 --> 01:37:40.821
AND EVEN HOLDING VACCINE EVENTS

01:37:40.888 --> 01:37:42.590
WITH WITH PUBLIC HEALTH RECURSOS

01:37:42.656 --> 01:37:43.257
WHAT KIND OF ACTIVITIES ARE THEY

01:37:43.324 --> 01:37:44.191
MAY BE SEPARATE FROM THE

01:37:44.258 --> 01:37:45.459
DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT WE CAN

01:37:45.526 --> 01:37:46.961
INTERVENE SUGGEST THAT CONCEPT

01:37:47.027 --> 01:37:48.295
OF THE MONEY DOESN'T ALL SLOW

01:37:48.362 --> 01:37:49.597
DOWN SECOND POINT.

01:37:49.663 --> 01:37:51.699
ON THIRD POINT IS THAT IT'S VERY

01:37:51.765 --> 01:37:53.234
IMPORTANT IN OUR EXPERIENCE WITH

01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:54.535
WORKING AND PAY FOR PERFORMANCE

01:37:54.602 --> 01:37:55.536
PROGRAMS.

01:37:55.603 --> 01:37:57.171
THAT IT IT TO CREATE BE VERY

01:37:57.238 --> 01:37:58.772
CAREFUL IN OUR DESIGN --

01:37:58.839 --> 01:38:00.441
IF THE IF IT'S NOT DESIGN WELL

01:38:00.507 --> 01:38:02.977
YOU CAN HAVE SOME MAJOR NEGATIVE

01:38:03.043 --> 01:38:04.278
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES ULCER

01:38:04.345 --> 01:38:05.512
ONE THAT WE'VE NOTICED IN OUR

01:38:05.579 --> 01:38:06.747
DELIVERY SYSTEM AGAIN HAVING TO

01:38:06.814 --> 01:38:08.282
DO WITH VACCINATION SINCE I KNOW

01:38:08.349 --> 01:38:11.018
THAT'S NEAR AND DEAR --

01:38:11.085 --> 01:38:12.753
TO CENTER PANTS HEART IS THAT --

01:38:12.820 --> 01:38:15.289
IF WE SET THE BAR REALLY HIGH

01:38:15.356 --> 01:38:16.790
FOR FOR A PEDIATRIC VACCINATIONS

01:38:16.857 --> 01:38:18.225
FOR INSTANCE TRYING TO ACHIEVE

01:38:18.292 --> 01:38:19.360
THE NINETIETH PERCENTILE IN

01:38:19.426 --> 01:38:19.660
SCITUATE --

01:38:19.727 --> 01:38:21.528
NATIONALLY SOME PRACTICES WILL

01:38:21.595 --> 01:38:22.997
SAY YOU KNOW I'VE GOT THESE

01:38:23.063 --> 01:38:24.698
PARENTS TO REFUSING VACCINATION

01:38:24.765 --> 01:38:25.799
I'M JUST GONNA GET A MODERATE

01:38:25.866 --> 01:38:26.900
PRACTICE AND THEN WHAT WE HAVE

01:38:26.967 --> 01:38:30.337
WHAT WE CALL --

01:38:30.404 --> 01:38:32.806
SORT OF THEIR VACCINE REFUGEE

01:38:32.873 --> 01:38:34.508
PAY FOR PERFORMANCE PROGRAM THIS

01:38:34.575 --> 01:38:35.409
IS GOING TO SUFFER IF THEY GET

01:38:35.476 --> 01:38:37.411
THEM IN THERE SUCH AN EXAMPLE

01:38:37.478 --> 01:38:38.312
THE NAY OF CONSEQUENCE FOR WE'VE

01:38:38.379 --> 01:38:39.213
DONE IT PARTNERSHIP AS WE

01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:40.514
LOWERED THE THRESHOLD LITTLE BIT

01:38:40.581 --> 01:38:42.049
JUST BECAUSE IT'S NOT THAT WE'RE

01:38:42.116 --> 01:38:43.851
NOT WE DON'T WANT TO TO HIT. 90%

01:38:43.917 --> 01:38:44.718
TELL BUT WE DON'T WANT THAT

01:38:44.785 --> 01:38:46.754
RIGHT THAT THAT THAT SORT OF THE

01:38:46.820 --> 01:38:48.355
THE KIDS WITHOUT PRIMARY CARE

01:38:48.422 --> 01:38:49.123
HOMES.

01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:50.557
AND THEN ON THE LAST THE LAST

01:38:50.624 --> 01:38:51.959
POINT IS I KNOW THAT --

01:38:52.026 --> 01:38:55.162
CHRIS KIND OF TALKED A BIT ABOUT.

01:38:55.229 --> 01:38:56.897
THE THE CHANGES WITH MEDICAL

01:38:56.964 --> 01:38:58.032
MANAGE COLONEL JUST FROM MY

01:38:58.098 --> 01:38:59.300
PERSPECTIVE AS SOMEONE WHO'S THE

01:38:59.366 --> 01:39:01.669
RECIPIENT OF THE DH CS IS --

01:39:01.735 --> 01:39:03.470
ACTIVITIES ONE THING I'VE

01:39:03.537 --> 01:39:04.972
NOTICED ABOUT --

01:39:05.039 --> 01:39:06.407
ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO THEY THEY

01:39:06.473 --> 01:39:08.475
DEFINITELY RAMPED UP DCS RAMPED

01:39:08.542 --> 01:39:10.044
UP ITS ITS ATTENTION TO THE

01:39:10.110 --> 01:39:11.345
QUALITY OUTCOMES.

01:39:11.412 --> 01:39:12.446
AND IT TAKES A LITTLE WHILE TO

01:39:12.513 --> 01:39:13.981
SEE THAT AFFECT BUT WE DID SEE

01:39:14.048 --> 01:39:16.283
THAT IF YOU COMPARE

01:39:16.350 --> 01:39:17.184
200-016-22000 SEVENTEEN HE JUST

01:39:17.251 --> 01:39:18.552
DATA THAT'S WHEN THE ACTUAL

01:39:18.619 --> 01:39:20.220
ACTIVITY HAPPEN TWO THOUSAND

01:39:20.287 --> 01:39:21.221
EIGHTY IS BEING COLLECTED NOW

01:39:21.288 --> 01:39:21.689
SHE WON'T HAVE THAT.

01:39:21.755 --> 01:39:23.023
TILL THIS SUMMER ON THERE IS

01:39:23.090 --> 01:39:24.925
ABOUT A 425% IMPROVEMENT

01:39:24.992 --> 01:39:26.160
GLOBALLY IF YOU JUST LOOKED AT

01:39:26.226 --> 01:39:27.828
ALL THE PLANTS GLOBALLY ACROSS

01:39:27.895 --> 01:39:29.596
THAT I KNOW THAT BECAUSE WE HAD

01:39:29.663 --> 01:39:31.231
A RAW DATA AND LEAD IMPROVE BY

01:39:31.298 --> 01:39:32.966
ABOUT 45% WE WERE VERY EXCITED

01:39:33.033 --> 01:39:33.967
ABOUT THAT.

01:39:34.034 --> 01:39:37.438
BUT BUT A RELATIVE RANKING SEE

01:39:37.504 --> 01:39:38.072
OTHER HEALTH PLANS WAS ABOUT THE

01:39:38.138 --> 01:39:41.008
SAME BECAUSE SO I THINK THAT.

01:39:41.075 --> 01:39:42.209
THAT IT EXTRA ATTENTION

01:39:42.276 --> 01:39:43.310
INCLUDING THREATS OF OF

01:39:43.377 --> 01:39:44.878
FINANCIAL SANCTIONS CORRECTIVE

01:39:44.945 --> 01:39:46.714
ACTION PLANS GOING INTO TO SEE

01:39:46.780 --> 01:39:48.415
THAT GOING TO THE DEPARTMENT

01:39:48.482 --> 01:39:49.416

YOU'RE DOING ARE HAVING AN

01:39:50.884 --> 01:39:52.286
IMPACT IN THE BIG QUESTION IS.

01:39:52.353 --> 01:39:53.987
WHEN YOU PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION

01:39:54.054 --> 01:39:55.622
TO SOMETHING DO YOU HOW MUCH

01:39:55.689 --> 01:39:56.990
ADDITIONAL BENEFITS YOU GET A

01:39:57.057 --> 01:39:58.359

01:40:50.911 --> 01:40:52.279
LIKE BOB SAID I MELISSA MARSHALL

01:40:52.346 --> 01:40:52.913
AND A FAMILY DOCTOR IN THE CO

01:40:52.980 --> 01:40:54.481
COMMUNICATOR JUST ACROSS THE

01:40:54.548 --> 01:40:55.349
RIVER.

01:40:55.416 --> 01:40:56.550
WE TAKE CARE OF ONE EIGHT YOU'LL

01:40:56.617 --> 01:40:59.086
COUNTY RESIDENTS ABOUT A HUNDRED

01:40:59.153 --> 01:40:59.686
THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND VISITS A

01:40:59.753 --> 01:41:00.020
YEAR.

01:41:00.087 --> 01:41:01.822
SO PRETTY SIGNIFICANT IN TERMS

01:41:01.889 --> 01:41:03.323
OF THE POPULATION WERE SERVING.

01:41:03.390 --> 01:41:04.625
A BEFORE I START I ACTUALLY

01:41:04.691 --> 01:41:06.260
WANTED TO TALK ABOUT YOUR

01:41:06.326 --> 01:41:07.461
ALIGNMENT QUESTION.

01:41:07.528 --> 01:41:09.363
AND IT MADE ME THINK ABOUT

01:41:09.430 --> 01:41:11.064
PRIMARY CARE SPEND.

01:41:11.131 --> 01:41:13.167
SO NATIONALLY WE KNOW THAT

01:41:13.233 --> 01:41:16.270
PRIMARY CARE SPEND IS ABOUT 527%

01:41:16.336 --> 01:41:17.438
OF THE TOTAL SPEND.

01:41:17.504 --> 01:41:19.139
AND PARTNERSHIP ACTUALLY INVEST

01:41:19.206 --> 01:41:21.041
QUITE A BIT MORE IN THEIR Q. I.

01:41:21.108 --> 01:41:22.876
P. THAT ACTUALLY ATTRIBUTES FOR

01:41:22.943 --> 01:41:24.445
A HIGHER LEVEL OF SPEND.

01:41:24.511 --> 01:41:26.713
WE ALSO SEE THAT IN PRIVATE

01:41:26.780 --> 01:41:28.215
INTEGRATED HEALTH SYSTEMS.

01:41:28.282 --> 01:41:30.684
SO PLACES LIKE HIGHS ARE ALSO IN

01:41:30.751 --> 01:41:32.719
CARE.

01:41:32.786 --> 01:41:33.754
AND WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:41:33.821 --> 01:41:35.522
THE SLIDE IN TERMS OF PAYMENTS

01:41:35.589 --> 01:41:37.324
FOR HEALTH PLANS YOU'RE ACTUALLY

01:41:37.391 --> 01:41:39.259
TALKING ABOUT EVERYBODY GETTING

01:41:39.326 --> 01:41:40.861
SQUEEZED IN TERMS OF THE PRIMARY

01:41:40.928 --> 01:41:42.196
CARE SPEND.

01:41:42.262 --> 01:41:43.197
AND SO I THINK IN TERMS OF

01:41:43.263 --> 01:41:45.466
LEGISLATION OR THINGS YOU CAN DO.

01:41:45.532 --> 01:41:47.868
ALIGNING INVESTMENT IN PRIMARY

01:41:47.935 --> 01:41:50.771
CARE IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE

01:41:50.838 --> 01:41:51.405
BIGGEST BANKS ARE GOING TO HAVE

01:41:51.472 --> 01:41:52.973
FOR THE BUCK --

01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:54.007
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT Q. I. P.

01:41:54.074 --> 01:41:55.342
BECAUSE IT'S HAD A SIGNIFICANT

01:41:55.409 --> 01:41:56.877
ROLE FOR COMMUNICATOR --

01:41:56.944 --> 01:41:59.213
IT ALLOWS US TO INVEST IN BOTH

01:41:59.279 --> 01:42:01.515
ROLES AN INFRASTRUCTURE --

01:42:01.582 --> 01:42:03.183
THE ROLES ARE PRETTY VARIED SO

01:42:03.250 --> 01:42:04.885
WE A COMMUNICATOR WE HAVE A

01:42:04.952 --> 01:42:06.587
CHIEF QUALITY OFFICER I I WAS

01:42:06.653 --> 01:42:07.354
PRETTY EXCITED TO JOIN

01:42:07.421 --> 01:42:09.223
COMMUNICATOR THE FACT THAT WE

01:42:09.289 --> 01:42:09.756
WOULD HAVE A CHIEF QUALITY

01:42:09.823 --> 01:42:10.958
OFFICER --

01:42:11.024 --> 01:42:12.059
IT SHOWED THAT THERE WAS A

01:42:12.125 --> 01:42:14.294
LEADERSHIP INVESTMENT IN QUALITY

01:42:14.361 --> 01:42:15.562
AND INFRASTRUCTURE --

01:42:15.629 --> 01:42:16.897
WE ALSO HAVE PREVENTIVE CARE

01:42:16.964 --> 01:42:18.365
COORDINATORS IN EACH OF OUR

01:42:18.432 --> 01:42:21.702
SITES AND THOSE FOLKS BASICALLY.

01:42:21.768 --> 01:42:22.769
THEY SERVE AS KIND O THE RING

01:42:22.836 --> 01:42:24.238
MASTER FOR ALL OF THE QUALITY

01:42:24.304 --> 01:42:26.273
IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS.

01:42:26.340 --> 01:42:28.308
WE ALSO HAVE A CASE MANAGER THE

01:42:28.375 --> 01:42:30.177
DOES CARE TRANSITIONS SO ANYTIME

01:42:30.244 --> 01:42:31.612
SOMEONE'S IN THE HOSPITAL OR IN

01:42:31.678 --> 01:42:32.946
IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM WE HAVE

01:42:33.013 --> 01:42:34.882
SOMEONE HELPING TO BRIDGE THAT

01:42:34.948 --> 01:42:36.283
PERSON BACK TO THE HEALTH CENTER.

01:42:36.350 --> 01:42:38.652
WE BELIEVE THAT REDUCES COSTS.

01:42:38.719 --> 01:42:40.721
I'M WITH OUR REGIONAL CONSORTIA

01:42:40.787 --> 01:42:41.889
REDWOOD COMMUNITY HEALTH

01:42:41.955 --> 01:42:43.390
COALITION WE'VE INVESTED IN A

01:42:43.457 --> 01:42:44.992
DATA ANALYTICS PLATFORM CALLED

01:42:45.058 --> 01:42:46.293
RELEVANT.

01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:47.461
AND THIS MAY NOT SOUND VERY

01:42:47.528 --> 01:42:48.829
EXCITING UNLESS YOUR DATA GEEK

01:42:48.896 --> 01:42:50.097
LIKE MYSELF --

01:42:50.163 --> 01:42:51.698
BUT RELEVANT ACTUALLY ALLOWS US

01:42:51.765 --> 01:42:53.000
TO SEE THE DATA.

01:42:53.066 --> 01:42:54.301
I KNOW WHEN I FIRST STARTED IT

01:42:54.368 --> 01:42:55.702
COMMUNICATOR IT WAS HARD WE

01:42:55.769 --> 01:42:57.070
WOULD GET MAYBE THIRTY

01:42:57.137 --> 01:42:58.038
SPREADSHEETS A MONTH FROM

01:42:58.105 --> 01:42:59.339
PARTNERSHIP AND WE WERE TRYING

01:42:59.406 --> 01:43:00.674
TO MATCH THE SPREADSHEETS ABOUT

01:43:00.741 --> 01:43:02.075
WHO THE MEMBERS WERE.

01:43:02.142 --> 01:43:03.410
WHO NEEDED THE IMMUNIZATIONS WHO

01:43:03.477 --> 01:43:05.846
NEEDED THEIR CALL IT'S REALLY

01:43:05.913 --> 01:43:08.448
HARD TO DRILL DOWN TO THAT DATA?

01:43:08.515 --> 01:43:10.017
AND NOW WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT

01:43:10.083 --> 01:43:11.718
HAS ACTIONABLE.

01:43:11.785 --> 01:43:13.654
LIVE DATA THERE'S A DOWNLOAD

01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:15.155
EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND WERE

01:43:15.222 --> 01:43:16.823
ABLE TO DRILL DOWN TO THE

01:43:16.890 --> 01:43:18.926
PATIENT AND PROVIDER LEVEL --

01:43:18.992 --> 01:43:20.861
WE WORKING CARE TEAM SO ACTUALLY

01:43:20.928 --> 01:43:22.396
THAT DATA IS --

01:43:22.462 --> 01:43:24.331
WHAT I CALL DEMOCRATIZED MEANING

01:43:24.398 --> 01:43:25.799
THAT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO IT

01:43:25.866 --> 01:43:27.234
AND IT'S TRANSPARENT?

01:43:27.301 --> 01:43:28.602
AND I THINK THIS IS A CULTURE

01:43:28.669 --> 01:43:30.337
SHIFT FOR US --

01:43:30.404 --> 01:43:31.939
WELL WE APPRECIATE --

01:43:32.005 --> 01:43:33.774
PARTNERSHIPS EFFORT TO DO A LOT

01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:35.108
OF TRAINING I THINK THAT'S

01:43:35.175 --> 01:43:36.843
PROBABLY FOUNDATIONAL IN TERMS

01:43:36.910 --> 01:43:38.178
OF US DEVELOPING.

01:43:38.245 --> 01:43:40.581
A CULTURE OF QUALITY WE'VE NOW

01:43:40.647 --> 01:43:41.415
SORT OF TAKEN IT TO THE NEXT

01:43:41.481 --> 01:43:42.149
LEVEL.

01:43:42.215 --> 01:43:43.584
AND ULTIMATELY IT HAS TO DO WITH

01:43:43.650 --> 01:43:45.285
EVERYONE ON THE CARE TEAM REALLY

01:43:45.352 --> 01:43:47.154
FEELING INVESTED IN IN THIS

01:43:47.220 --> 01:43:48.956
CULTURAL QUALITY --

01:43:49.022 --> 01:43:50.657
ARE CARE TEAMS WORK ON STANDING

01:43:50.724 --> 01:43:52.893
ORDERS THEY ACTUALLY CAN LOOK AT

01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:54.528
THAT OUR SYSTEM AND THEY CAN SAY

01:43:54.595 --> 01:43:55.696
WHO ARE THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE

01:43:55.762 --> 01:43:57.397
DUE FOR VACCINATIONS AND THEY'RE

01:43:57.464 --> 01:43:57.931
GOING.

01:43:57.998 --> 01:43:59.333
TO YOU KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE

01:43:59.399 --> 01:44:00.867
TWO NEXT MONTH SO WE BETTER GET

01:44:00.934 --> 01:44:02.302
A MAN NEXT WEEK --

01:44:02.369 --> 01:44:03.937
AND THIS IS NOT THE POSITION AT

01:44:04.004 --> 01:44:05.906
THE TIME OF THE VISIT THIS IS

01:44:05.973 --> 01:44:07.274
NOT ME DOCTOR MARSHALL SEEING A

01:44:07.341 --> 01:44:09.109
PATIENT AND TRYING TO DECIDE

01:44:09.176 --> 01:44:10.477
EVERYTHING THAT MY PATIENT NEEDS

01:44:10.544 --> 01:44:11.945
ALTHOUGH WE DO THAT.

01:44:12.012 --> 01:44:14.014
TOO THIS IS ALSO OUT REACH THIS

01:44:14.081 --> 01:44:17.084
IS TRUE POP IT'S INTERESTING I

01:44:17.150 --> 01:44:18.452
JUST WANNA TELL A QUICK STORY

01:44:18.518 --> 01:44:20.153
ABOUT THAT SO --

01:44:20.220 --> 01:44:22.356
COMMUNICATOR AND I'VE TOLD THIS

01:44:22.422 --> 01:44:22.990
TO BOB ALREADY I'M PRETTY PROUD

01:44:23.056 --> 01:44:23.924
OF THIS --

01:44:23.991 --> 01:44:26.426
COMMUNICATOR ACTUALLY MET ALL OF

01:44:26.493 --> 01:44:28.228
OUR CLINICAL QUALITY MEASURES --

01:44:28.295 --> 01:44:29.830
AND MOST OF THOSE ARE AT THE

01:44:29.896 --> 01:44:32.199
NINETIETH PERCENTILE FOR HE DOES --

01:44:32.265 --> 01:44:33.133
SO YOU THINK ABOUT OUR

01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:34.267
POPULATION WE DON'T TURN ANYONE

01:44:34.334 --> 01:44:36.470
AWAY -- YOU

01:44:36.536 --> 01:44:37.537
KNOW WE'RE IN COMMUNITIES LIKE

01:44:37.604 --> 01:44:38.839
WEST SACRAMENTO JUST ACROSS THE

01:44:38.905 --> 01:44:40.607
RIVER WHERE WE HAVE VERY COMPLEX

01:44:40.674 --> 01:44:41.541
PATIENTS.

01:44:41.608 --> 01:44:43.310
AND WE MET ALL OF OUR CLINICAL

01:44:43.377 --> 01:44:45.846
QUALITY MEASURES WE WERE LACKING

01:44:45.912 --> 01:44:46.947
ONE ONE PATIENT ONE MEASURE ONE

01:44:47.014 --> 01:44:48.548
CLINIC.

01:44:48.615 --> 01:44:51.318
AND OUR CLINIC MANAGER BIANCA.

01:44:51.385 --> 01:44:53.020
WAS AT HOME TAKING CARE FOR SICK

01:44:53.086 --> 01:44:55.288
CHILD READ AMMONIA.

01:44:55.355 --> 01:44:56.823
AND DECIDED THAT WHILE HER CHILD

01:44:56.890 --> 01:44:58.091
WAS NAPPING SHE WAS GOING TO

01:44:58.158 --> 01:44:59.626
ACTUALLY GO ON TO RELEVANT AND

01:44:59.693 --> 01:45:00.794
LOOK THROUGH THE LIST ONE MORE

01:45:00.861 --> 01:45:02.696
TIME JUST TO SEE.

01:45:02.763 --> 01:45:04.197
AND SHE FOUND A PATIENT THAT SHE

01:45:04.264 --> 01:45:05.232
HAD TAKEN CARE OF WHEN SHE WAS

01:45:05.298 --> 01:45:06.767
SERVING AS A MEDICAL ASSISTANT

01:45:06.833 --> 01:45:08.201
AT COMMUNICATOR.

01:45:08.268 --> 01:45:09.336
WHO OFTEN WENT BY HER MAIDEN

01:45:09.403 --> 01:45:10.704
NAME?

01:45:10.771 --> 01:45:11.605
AND HAD JUST BEEN IN THE

01:45:11.672 --> 01:45:12.839
HOSPITAL BECAUSE SHE HAD TAKEN

01:45:12.906 --> 01:45:14.641
CARE FOR AND SO SHE WENT INTO

01:45:14.708 --> 01:45:16.877
THE HOSPITAL MEDICAL RECORD AND

01:45:16.943 --> 01:45:17.477
SHE FOUND THAT LAST LOSS COULD

01:45:17.544 --> 01:45:18.912
BE.

01:45:18.979 --> 01:45:20.681
ALLOWING US TO ACHIEVE THAT LAST

01:45:20.747 --> 01:45:21.481
MEASURE.

01:45:21.548 --> 01:45:23.316
AND REALLY I MEAN I WAS SO

01:45:23.383 --> 01:45:24.251
EXCITED ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I

01:45:24.317 --> 01:45:26.386
THOUGHT THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE

01:45:26.453 --> 01:45:27.821
THE WORKING FOR IS THAT EVERYONE

01:45:27.888 --> 01:45:29.589
REALLY CARES ABOUT THE QUALITY

01:45:29.656 --> 01:45:31.591
OF CARE THAT WE WE DELIVER

01:45:31.658 --> 01:45:31.858
PATIENCE.

01:45:31.925 --> 01:45:33.293
I'M.

01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:34.995
JUST TO JUST TO WRAP THINGS UP I

01:45:35.062 --> 01:45:36.630
DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT HEALTHCARE

01:45:36.697 --> 01:45:37.531
DISPARITIES.

01:45:37.597 --> 01:45:38.832
BECAUSE A COMMUNICATOR EVEN

01:45:38.899 --> 01:45:40.500
THOUGH WE ARE A TOP PERFORMER

01:45:40.567 --> 01:45:42.869
QUALITY OR NOT A TOP PERFORMER

01:45:42.936 --> 01:45:43.870
ACROSS THE BOARD.

01:45:43.937 --> 01:45:45.172
WERE TOP PERFORMER IN

01:45:45.238 --> 01:45:46.773
PARTNERSHIPS --

01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:48.542
QUALITY INCENTIVE PROGRAM BUT

01:45:48.608 --> 01:45:49.743
WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOME OF OUR

01:45:49.810 --> 01:45:50.944
OTHER PATIENTS THEY'RE NOT

01:45:51.011 --> 01:45:52.245
MEETING THE SAME MEASURES

01:45:52.312 --> 01:45:53.513
THEY'RE NOT HAVING THE SAME

01:45:53.580 --> 01:45:54.681
QUALITY OF CARE.

01:45:54.748 --> 01:45:56.016
AND SOME OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH

01:45:56.083 --> 01:45:59.186
WE DON'T HAVE FOR TO DELIVER.

01:45:59.252 --> 01:46:00.320
OR JUST STARTING NOW THAT WE

01:46:00.387 --> 01:46:02.022
HAVE THE DATA NOW THAT WE HAVE

01:46:02.089 --> 01:46:03.590
THE STATE ANALYTICS PLATFORM TO

01:46:03.657 --> 01:46:05.525
REALLY EXPLORE HOW WE CAN BETTER

01:46:05.592 --> 01:46:06.660
MEET THE CLINICAL QUALITY FOR

01:46:06.727 --> 01:46:07.961
ALL OF OUR PATIENTS ACROSS THE

01:46:08.028 --> 01:46:08.628
BOARD.

01:46:08.695 --> 01:46:09.896
WHETHER THEY HAVE MEDI CAL

01:46:09.963 --> 01:46:11.331
MANAGED CARE WHETHER THEIR

01:46:11.398 --> 01:46:12.799
MEDICARE WHETHER THEY'RE

01:46:12.866 --> 01:46:14.367
UNINSURED --

01:46:14.434 --> 01:46:15.235
AND WE'RE REALLY WORKING HARD ON

01:46:15.302 --> 01:46:17.237
THAT BUT I DO THINK IT IS AN

01:46:17.304 --> 01:46:19.106
INVESTMENT IN PRIMARY CARE

01:46:19.172 --> 01:46:19.606
THAT'S GOING TO MAKE THE

01:46:19.673 --> 01:46:20.073
DIFFERENCE [inaudible]

01:46:20.140 --> 01:46:25.846
THANK YOU [inaudible]

01:46:25.912 --> 01:46:42.028
AFTER A

01:46:45.398 --> 01:46:47.934
GOOD AFTERNOON.

01:46:48.001 --> 01:46:49.836
THE CAN AND COMMITTEE --

01:46:49.903 --> 01:46:50.670
MY NAME IS THERESA CHAU I'M THE

01:46:50.737 --> 01:46:52.672
MEDICAL DIRECTOR OF QUALITY OF

01:46:52.739 --> 01:46:54.407

WE CAN SAVE THEM FOR HIM --

01:47:12.259 --> 01:47:14.127
I A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MYSELF I AM

01:47:14.194 --> 01:47:15.095
FAMILY MEDICINE TRAINED --

01:47:15.162 --> 01:47:16.396
AT THE VENTURE PROGRAM I A TEN

YEARS AGO DEVELOPED AN INTEREST

01:47:17.964 --> 01:47:18.799
IN DIABETES --

01:47:18.865 --> 01:47:20.834
INTERESTINGLY IN PART BECAUSE

01:47:20.901 --> 01:47:22.702
OUR SPECIALISTS WERE NOT.

01:47:22.769 --> 01:47:25.005
INTERESTED IN DEVELOP TO IN

01:47:38.285 --> 01:47:40.887
IT SEEM LIKE RELEASED DEVELOPING

01:47:40.954 --> 01:47:44.758
THAT EXPERTISE MANAGEMENT WAS

01:47:44.825 --> 01:47:45.292

CLINIC THAT ARE MOSTLY COLOCATED

01:48:08.081 --> 01:48:09.583
WITH THOSE PRIMARY CARE.

01:48:09.649 --> 01:48:10.550
CLINICS --

OUR CLINICS OF OVER --

01:48:22.495 --> 01:48:23.563
EIGHTY THOUSAND MANAGEMENT CAL

OF PATIENTS IN THE GOLD COAST

HEALTH PLAN AND OF THE PRIMARY

01:48:25.498 --> 01:48:26.733
CARE OUTPATIENT VISITS TO OUR

01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:29.236
HEALTH SYSTEM 87% OF THEM ARE

ENROLLED IN THAT MANAGEMENT

01:48:29.870 --> 01:48:33.607
HEALTH PLAN.

01:48:33.673 --> 01:48:35.242
BECAUSE COUNTY OR TO PLAN OF

01:48:35.308 --> 01:48:36.776
KNOW WE'RE NOT AT THE MOMENT

01:48:36.843 --> 01:48:39.446
WE'RE NOT NOW YOU'RE A FOR IS A

01:48:39.512 --> 01:48:40.780
COUNTY ACCOUNT ORDER.

01:48:40.847 --> 01:48:42.549
YEAH BECAUSE YEAH BUT WE'RE NOT

01:48:42.616 --> 01:48:47.687
A TO PLAN MODEL OKAY.

01:48:47.754 --> 01:48:48.288
YEAH YEAH OKAY THAT'S WHAT THE

01:48:48.355 --> 01:48:51.758
YES AND NO --

01:48:51.825 --> 01:48:53.159
BUT THE PRIME PROGRAM A AND THE

01:48:53.226 --> 01:48:54.127
INVENTOR IS ONE OF THAT TWENTY

01:48:54.194 --> 01:48:54.928
ONE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEMS THAT

01:48:54.995 --> 01:48:56.463
PARTICIPATE IN PRIME WHICH IS

01:48:56.529 --> 01:48:57.264
PART OF ELEVEN FIFTEEN MEDICAL

01:48:57.330 --> 01:48:57.964
WAIVER --

01:48:58.031 --> 01:48:59.165
PRIME IS A PAY FOR PERFORMANCE --

01:48:59.232 --> 01:49:00.200
PROGRAM WHICH IN WHICH EACH OF

01:49:00.267 --> 01:49:01.601
THE SYSTEMS TAKES ON FIFTY TO

01:49:01.668 --> 01:49:02.702
SEVENTY PERFORMANCE METRICS OVER

01:49:02.769 --> 01:49:04.070
NINE PROJECTS WHEN I BECAME THE

01:49:04.137 --> 01:49:05.171
QUALITY MEDICAL DIRECTOR IT WAS

01:49:05.238 --> 01:49:05.739
KIND OF ON THE TAIL END OF

01:49:05.805 --> 01:49:06.806
DISTRICT --

01:49:06.873 --> 01:49:07.674
DISTRICT WAS --

01:49:07.741 --> 01:49:08.775
IF THEY DID HAVE A QUALITY

01:49:08.842 --> 01:49:10.610
COMPONENT TO IT BUT THE AGENCIES

01:49:10.677 --> 01:49:12.178
WERE ALLOWED TO PICK THEIR OWN

01:49:12.245 --> 01:49:12.979
MEASURES IN THEIR OWN BENCHMARKS.

01:49:13.046 --> 01:49:14.714
TIME IS VERY DIFFERENT IN THE

01:49:14.781 --> 01:49:18.018
SENSE THAT WE ALL OF SAME HIGH

01:49:18.084 --> 01:49:19.786
LEVEL BENCHMARKS.

01:49:19.853 --> 01:49:21.221
ON THE INCLUDE PRIMARY SPECIALTY

01:49:21.288 --> 01:49:23.356
CARE CARE TRANSITIONS AND

01:49:23.423 --> 01:49:24.791
THERE'S A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON

01:49:24.858 --> 01:49:26.192
HIGH RISK POPULATION SUCH AS THE

01:49:26.259 --> 01:49:28.628
ONES THAT WE SERVE.

01:49:28.695 --> 01:49:31.498
IT OFFERS FROM MY CLINIC.

01:49:31.564 --> 01:49:32.632
SO THE FUNDING MECHANISM FOR

01:49:32.699 --> 01:49:33.900
PRIME IS SUCH THAT YOU YOU

01:49:33.967 --> 01:49:35.268
REALLY HAVE TO MEET THE METRIC

01:49:35.335 --> 01:49:36.569
TO GET THE MONEY --

01:49:36.636 --> 01:49:38.438
AND SO WHAT'S DIFFICULT ABOUT IT

01:49:38.505 --> 01:49:39.839
ALTHOUGH IT ALIGNS VERY CLOSELY

01:49:39.906 --> 01:49:40.674
WITH WHAT WE'RE CLINICALLY

01:49:40.740 --> 01:49:42.742
INTERESTED IN DOING IN OUR

01:49:42.809 --> 01:49:43.810
SYSTEM -- IT

01:49:43.877 --> 01:49:45.312
REALLY REQUIRES YEAR OVER YEAR

01:49:45.378 --> 01:49:46.746
PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT IN OTHER

01:49:46.813 --> 01:49:48.481
WORDS YOU CAN GET YOUR YOU CAN

01:49:48.548 --> 01:49:50.183
GET YOUR TO YOUR BENCHMARK FOR

01:49:50.250 --> 01:49:50.850
ONE YEAR BUT THEN THAT BENCHMARK

01:49:50.917 --> 01:49:52.686
DOES NOT STAY STAGNANT YOU HAVE

01:49:52.752 --> 01:49:53.787
TO GO ANOTHER 10% TOWARDS THE

01:49:53.853 --> 01:49:55.322
NINETIETH PERCENTILE. TO GET

01:49:55.388 --> 01:49:56.856
YOUR MONEY FOR THE FOLLOWING

01:49:56.923 --> 01:49:58.358
YEAR SO.

01:49:58.425 --> 01:50:00.293
THE MET THE BENCHMARKS OUT RISE

01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:01.661
OVER TIME AND THE FUNDING I SHE

01:50:01.728 --> 01:50:05.332
DOES DECREASE OVER THE THE A A

01:50:05.398 --> 01:50:07.534
LIFETIME OF THE PROGRAM --

01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:08.335
SO THAT'S THE THE GAP CLOSURE

01:50:08.401 --> 01:50:09.569
MECHANISM THAT REALLY JUST

01:50:09.636 --> 01:50:11.972
ALLOWS US NOT TO I JUST REST ON

01:50:12.038 --> 01:50:13.673
OUR LAURELS BUT REALLY KIND OF

01:50:13.740 --> 01:50:15.442
CONTINUE THAT PERFORMANCE --

01:50:15.508 --> 01:50:16.843
FOR THAT WORK HERE EVERY YEAR --

01:50:16.910 --> 01:50:19.045
NOTABLY THE ALL OF THE AGENCIES

01:50:19.112 --> 01:50:20.547
THAT PARTICIPATE HAVE TO PROVIDE

01:50:20.613 --> 01:50:21.881
THE NON FEDERAL SHARE UP FRONT

01:50:21.948 --> 01:50:22.649
TO LEVERAGE THE FEDERAL FUNDING

01:50:22.716 --> 01:50:24.884
AND THIS HAS NO IMPACT ON THE

01:50:24.951 --> 01:50:28.388
STATE GENERAL FUND.

01:50:28.455 --> 01:50:29.422
SO FOR VENTURE IN PARTICULAR

01:50:29.489 --> 01:50:30.457
PRIME FUNDING IS ESSENTIAL PART

01:50:30.523 --> 01:50:31.124
OF OUR VISIT IT'S A IT'S A LARGE

01:50:31.191 --> 01:50:32.425
AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR US AND IT IS

01:50:32.492 --> 01:50:33.593
REALLY HELPFUL --

01:50:33.660 --> 01:50:34.394
IN TERMS OF GETTING

01:50:34.461 --> 01:50:37.630
ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT FOR THE

01:50:37.697 --> 01:50:39.099
NEED FOR PRIVATE FOR REAL --

01:50:39.165 --> 01:50:40.934
CLICK A QUALITY IMPROVEMENT --

01:50:41.001 --> 01:50:44.504
WE TRY TO BE AS THAT OTHERS HAVE

01:50:44.571 --> 01:50:45.071
FOR THAN IT OF MORE THINGS

01:50:45.138 --> 01:50:45.972
MENTIONED THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF

01:50:46.039 --> 01:50:46.606
DATA SHARING ON THAT'S BEEN ONE

01:50:46.673 --> 01:50:47.407
OF THE BIGGEST IMPROVE

01:50:47.474 --> 01:50:48.641
IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR COUNTY.

01:50:48.708 --> 01:50:50.043
ON GETTING THAT DATA TO THE

01:50:50.110 --> 01:50:52.512
CLINICS TO AND SO THAT EACH

01:50:52.579 --> 01:50:53.346
INDIVIDUAL CUT CAN UNDERSTAND

01:50:53.413 --> 01:50:54.147
WHERE THEY'RE SHAUN CAREY GAPS

01:50:54.214 --> 01:50:55.248
ARE -- AND

01:50:55.315 --> 01:50:56.750
THEN TIE TRYING TO TAKE THAT TO

01:50:56.816 --> 01:50:58.151
SORT OF MORE OF AN INCENTIVE

01:50:58.218 --> 01:51:01.388
TYPE OF A ROLE THAT THE

01:51:01.454 --> 01:51:04.824
CONNECTION PLAY TO GET THERE.

01:51:04.891 --> 01:51:06.559
MEASURES IMPROVED.

01:51:06.626 --> 01:51:07.794
OF WE A NO HAVE DESIGNED A LOT

01:51:07.861 --> 01:51:09.095
OF WAYS TO HELP WITH CHRONIC

01:51:09.162 --> 01:51:09.896
DISEASE MANAGEMENT IN THE COUNTY

01:51:09.963 --> 01:51:11.331
WE HAVE A HIGH PREVALENCE OF

01:51:11.398 --> 01:51:13.666
DIABETES AND IN MY DIMAS CLINIC

01:51:13.733 --> 01:51:14.901
I THINK EACH OF US AS CONDITIONS

01:51:14.968 --> 01:51:15.535
THINGS WE DO IS A VERY GOOD JOB

01:51:15.602 --> 01:51:15.769
RIGHT.

01:51:15.835 --> 01:51:16.936
AND I DON'T THINK THAT BEFORE

01:51:17.003 --> 01:51:18.972
PRIME WE HAD TRULY AN IDEA OF

01:51:19.039 --> 01:51:20.407
HOW WE WERE DOING THE NOT ONLY

01:51:20.473 --> 01:51:22.242
FOR OURSELVES BUT IN COMPARISON

01:51:22.308 --> 01:51:23.143
TO OTHERS.

01:51:23.209 --> 01:51:23.843
ONSO WE HAD GROUP MEDICAL

01:51:23.910 --> 01:51:25.945
VISITS VIçT EDUCATION SESSIONS

01:51:26.012 --> 01:51:27.714
A MULTI DISCIPLINARY CARE WITH A

01:51:27.781 --> 01:51:29.549
PSYCHOLOGIST A NUTRITIONIST ALL

01:51:29.616 --> 01:51:30.316
OF THE THINGS THAT.

01:51:30.383 --> 01:51:31.718
ONCE WE WERE ABLE TO REALLY

01:51:31.785 --> 01:51:36.256
LEVERAGE THAT DATA OUT OF THE HR.

01:51:36.322 --> 01:51:37.323
WE DID FIND THAT WOULD DO QUITE

01:51:37.390 --> 01:51:38.224
WELL IT'S IDEAS MANAGEMENT SO

01:51:38.291 --> 01:51:38.825
FOR THE PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS

01:51:38.892 --> 01:51:41.161
WHO HAVE POOR CONTROL OR HE WILL

01:51:41.227 --> 01:51:42.295
BE WITH THE OVER 9% WE HAVE

01:51:42.362 --> 01:51:44.831
ALWAYS BEEN UNDER THE BAR.

01:51:44.898 --> 01:51:45.465
SO THIS IS ON THIS PERFORMANCE

01:51:45.532 --> 01:51:46.800
MEASURES METRIC FOR LOWER IS

01:51:46.866 --> 01:51:48.334
BETTER SO YEAR OVER YEAR WE'VE

01:51:48.401 --> 01:51:49.335
BEEN ABLE TO MAINTAIN THAT HOT

01:51:49.402 --> 01:51:50.203
THAT THAT HIGH LEVEL OF

01:51:50.270 --> 01:51:50.937
PERFORMANCE --

01:51:51.004 --> 01:51:52.205
SO IT SEEMS LIKE SOME OF THE

01:51:52.272 --> 01:51:53.273
THINGS THAT WE WERE DOING WHICH

01:51:53.339 --> 01:51:54.474
ARE THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX A

01:51:54.541 --> 01:51:55.408
LITTLE BIT BY A DOG PROVIDING

01:51:55.475 --> 01:51:56.876
MULTI DISCIPLINARY CARE AND

01:51:56.943 --> 01:51:58.178
GROUP VISITS AND THESE OTHER

01:51:58.244 --> 01:51:59.579
MODALITIES REALLY DID HELP US.

01:51:59.646 --> 01:52:01.047
IT ALSO DOESN'T HELP US LOOK AT

01:52:01.114 --> 01:52:02.482
SOMETHING SOMETHING THAT MIGHT

01:52:02.549 --> 01:52:03.750
BE TRENDS WE'RE NOT SURE --

01:52:03.817 --> 01:52:06.352
WHY THERE IS THAT SLIGHT UPTICK

01:52:06.419 --> 01:52:09.355
IN THE PERSON AGAIN I YOU KNOW

01:52:09.422 --> 01:52:11.024
WHEN WE WERE DATA FOR THIS IS

01:52:11.091 --> 01:52:11.658
THE TYPE INFORMATION WE WOULD

01:52:11.724 --> 01:52:13.059
NOT HAVE EVEN SEEN TO BE ABLE TO

01:52:13.126 --> 01:52:14.160
PREEMPTIVELY?

01:52:14.227 --> 01:52:17.197
FIGURE OUT WHAT THE BARRIERS ARE.

01:52:17.263 --> 01:52:18.865
SO IF I WERE TO REALLY SPEAK TO

01:52:18.932 --> 01:52:21.000
THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT WE HAVE

01:52:21.067 --> 01:52:22.635
SEEN OF A TRAP DAIS ON PRIME I

01:52:22.702 --> 01:52:23.470
WAS THE THE FIRST THING IS THE

01:52:23.536 --> 01:52:25.371
DATA YOU KNOW WE ARE VERY AGAIN

01:52:25.438 --> 01:52:27.273
AS I MENTIONED DATA POR PART.

01:52:27.340 --> 01:52:28.007
TIME -- MOST

01:52:28.074 --> 01:52:29.542
OF OUR DATA WAS COLLECTED

01:52:29.609 --> 01:52:31.177
THROUGHOUT MANUAL CHART AUDITS --

01:52:31.244 --> 01:52:32.512
AND SO WHEN WE FIRST IMPLEMENTED

01:52:32.579 --> 01:52:34.848
THE HR I NAIVELY THOUGHT THAT

01:52:34.914 --> 01:52:36.082
THIS WOULD BE JUST A PUSH OF A

01:52:36.149 --> 01:52:36.816
BUTTON AND YOU WOULD KNOW

01:52:36.883 --> 01:52:37.717
EXACTLY HOW MANY DIABETIC

FOCUSED ON THOSE PATIENTS OF

01:53:46.586 --> 01:53:47.687
RATHER THAN HAVING A HEALTH FOR

A PATIENT QUIT SMOKING AND THAT

01:54:21.154 --> 01:54:21.754
RIGHT THAT AND THE NARRATIVE AND

01:54:21.821 --> 01:54:23.223
THEY WOULD ASK ME WHY I COULDN'T

01:54:23.289 --> 01:54:24.290
CAPTURE THAT DATA.

01:54:24.357 --> 01:54:25.825
AND I WILL TRY TO EXPLAIN THAT

01:54:25.892 --> 01:54:27.760
THE DATA A DOCUMENTATIONS A VERY

01:54:27.827 --> 01:54:28.394
IMPORTANT PIECE OF COLLECTING

01:54:28.461 --> 01:54:30.296
DATA -- AND

01:54:30.363 --> 01:54:31.731
WHAT WE DO NOW IS WE TRAIN OUR

01:54:31.798 --> 01:54:32.966

01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:35.468
AUTOMATIC REFERRAL BUTTON IN.

01:54:35.535 --> 01:54:36.803
THE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD

01:54:36.869 --> 01:54:38.338
THAT GOES STRAIGHT --

01:54:38.404 --> 01:54:39.806

01:54:41.975 --> 01:54:44.043
TOBACCO CESSATION CLASS. FOR

01:54:44.110 --> 01:54:44.644
THAT TYPE OF AUTOMOTIVE CITY

01:54:44.711 --> 01:54:46.012
MAKES IT MUCH EASIER TO PARTNER

01:54:46.079 --> 01:54:47.347
WITH OUR WITH OTHER ON TO THE

01:54:47.413 --> 01:54:50.917
AGENCIES --

01:54:50.984 --> 01:54:51.517
TO HELP THE PATIENT WITH THOSE

01:54:51.584 --> 01:54:51.884
TYPES OF THINGS.

01:54:51.951 --> 01:54:55.054
SENDING ADOLESCENTS ADULTS FOR A

01:54:55.121 --> 01:54:56.456
ALCOHOL AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE ON

THAT AGAIN WAS NOT DONE ON A

01:54:57.957 --> 01:54:59.158
SYSTEMATIC.

01:54:59.225 --> 01:55:01.961
AGENCY WIDE LEVEL --

01:55:02.028 --> 01:55:02.996
AND SO THAT IS --

01:55:03.062 --> 01:55:04.697
IF A PATIENT DOES NEED SOME

01:55:04.764 --> 01:55:06.332
EXTRA HELP WE PARTNER WITH

01:55:06.399 --> 01:55:06.866
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FOR THAT

01:55:06.933 --> 01:55:08.368
REFERRAL.

01:55:08.434 --> 01:55:09.369
SO COLORFUL CANCER SCREENING --

01:55:09.435 --> 01:55:11.404
IS AN AREA WHERE WE REALLY WERE

01:55:11.471 --> 01:55:12.338
PERFORMING QUITE POORLY NEEDED --

01:55:12.405 --> 01:55:14.073
TO IT TO DO MANY THINGS TO TRY

01:55:14.140 --> 01:55:15.608
TO GET THAT IMPROVED I I

01:55:15.675 --> 01:55:16.509
MENTIONED AGAIN --

01:55:16.576 --> 01:55:17.610
OUTRAGE I THINK THAT'S A BIG

01:55:17.677 --> 01:55:19.312
PIECE OF IT HAVING THE DATA TO

01:55:19.379 --> 01:55:20.480
BE ABLE TO DO THAT WORK THIS

01:55:20.546 --> 01:55:22.682
DATA SHOWS YOU THAT WE'RE NOW UP

01:55:22.749 --> 01:55:24.384
258% FROM A FROM A FAIRLY LOW

01:55:24.450 --> 01:55:25.718
INITIAL PERFORMANCE AND REALLY

01:55:25.785 --> 01:55:27.420
IT REFLECTS DOING OVER FOUR

01:55:27.487 --> 01:55:29.622
THOUSAND MORE FIT TESTS PER YEAR.

01:55:29.689 --> 01:55:31.524

01:55:39.198 --> 01:55:40.033
TRUTHFULLY WHEN THIS STARTED I

01:55:40.099 --> 01:55:40.833
THINK WE'VE REALLY CAUGHT UP.

01:55:40.900 --> 01:55:42.035
BUT THAT WAS --

01:55:42.101 --> 01:55:45.138

DIFFERENT AND A LITTLE BIT

01:56:50.036 --> 01:56:51.070
UNIQUE --

01:56:51.137 --> 01:56:52.505
COMPARED TO OTHER COMPOUND

MAKING BIG IMPROVEMENTS IN THEIR

02:00:00.059 --> 02:00:01.294
LIVES -- WE

02:00:01.360 --> 02:00:02.395
DO STE ANTICIPATE THAT IN THE

02:00:02.461 --> 02:00:04.063
LONG TERM WE ARE GOING TO START

02:00:04.130 --> 02:00:06.666
SEEING MORE MORE COST SAVINGS

02:00:06.732 --> 02:00:07.733
AND REDUCTIONS IN THE NEW YEAR

02:00:07.800 --> 02:00:09.101
NECESSARY UTILIZATION IS IS

02:00:09.168 --> 02:00:09.869
WE'RE GETTING THESE MEMBERS

02:00:09.936 --> 02:00:11.337
RECONNECTED TO THEIR HEALTHCARE

02:00:11.404 --> 02:00:12.438
SYSTEM --

02:00:12.505 --> 02:00:16.842
BUT IN THE SHORT TERM THERE ARE

02:00:16.909 --> 02:00:18.878
THAT WE HAVE TO OVERCOME --

02:00:18.945 --> 02:00:20.479
THE THE PROGRAM.

02:00:20.546 --> 02:00:22.114
DOES REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT

02:00:22.181 --> 02:00:23.583
AMOUNT OF START UP EFFORT NOT

02:00:23.649 --> 02:00:24.917
JUST FROM THE HEALTH PLAN LEVEL

02:00:24.984 --> 02:00:26.385
I MEAN IT'S IT'S BEEN A LOT OF

02:00:26.452 --> 02:00:28.020
WORK FOR US AT THE HEALTH PLAN.

02:00:28.087 --> 02:00:29.755
BUT I THINK IT'S EVEN A BIGGER

02:00:29.822 --> 02:00:31.691
BURDEN ON THE LOCAL CLINICS --%

02:00:31.757 --> 02:00:32.925
YOU KNOW SOME OF THE CLINICS

02:00:32.992 --> 02:00:34.727

YOU KNOW THESE SACRAMENTO FOR

02:00:36.395 --> 02:00:37.763

02:00:37.830 --> 02:00:38.898
YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE'S A

02:00:38.965 --> 02:00:40.700
VARIETY OF WORKING WITH CLINICS

02:00:40.766 --> 02:00:41.701
LIKE THE WELL SPACE CLINICS WHO

02:00:41.767 --> 02:00:43.169
HAVE PROGRAMS IN STRONG

02:00:43.235 --> 02:00:44.537
INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEY'RE GONNA

02:00:44.604 --> 02:00:46.038
BE ABLE TO COME ON BOARD QUICKLY

02:00:46.105 --> 02:00:48.374
WE HAVE OTHER CLINICS WHICH YOU

02:00:48.441 --> 02:00:49.175
KNOW THEY'RE ALL ON BOARD THEY

02:00:49.241 --> 02:00:50.876
SEE A LOT OF VALUE IN THIS THEY

02:00:50.943 --> 02:00:52.678
WANT. TO CHANGE THEIR SYSTEM TO

02:00:52.745 --> 02:00:54.213
TO SERVE THIS PROGRAM BUT IT'S

02:00:54.280 --> 02:00:55.748
AN EXTREMELY HEAVY LEFT.

02:00:55.815 --> 02:00:57.750
AND SO IT IT IT DOES BECOME A

02:00:57.817 --> 02:00:59.919
BURDEN TO START UP THE PROGRAM --

02:00:59.986 --> 02:01:02.054
ALSO IT'S A VERY SLOW STARTING

02:01:02.121 --> 02:01:04.290
PROGRAM IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT ONE

02:01:04.357 --> 02:01:06.959

02:01:13.232 --> 02:01:15.334

YOU MAXED OUT --

02:02:33.279 --> 02:02:35.514

WERE SWEET WE DID DOING

02:02:45.224 --> 02:02:46.025
EVERYTHING SO WELL WE DID WE

02:02:46.092 --> 02:02:46.692
JUST KEEP DOING WHAT WE'RE DOING

02:02:46.759 --> 02:02:48.060
OR WAS THERE ACTUALLY WELL WE

02:02:48.127 --> 02:02:49.361
TRY TO DO SOME STUFF IT'LL BUT

02:02:49.428 --> 02:02:50.596
ACTUALLY WE DIDN'T SEE A BEND IN

02:02:50.663 --> 02:02:51.597
THE CAR AND AND AND THEIR

02:02:51.664 --> 02:02:52.998
PERFORMANCE CURVE.

02:02:53.065 --> 02:02:53.766
I I THINK A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH

02:02:53.833 --> 02:02:55.768
TUNA AND I THINK THAT --

02:02:55.835 --> 02:02:58.370
YOU KNOW WE A LOT RIGHT AROUND

02:02:58.437 --> 02:02:59.672
WHEN DAD ARE NO NUMBER SIR TO GO

02:02:59.739 --> 02:03:01.440
UP ON THE DIABETES IS WHEN WE

02:03:01.507 --> 02:03:02.942
HAD AND IT ANOTHER PROGRAM WHICH

02:03:03.008 --> 02:03:04.176
I I DIDN'T SPEAK ABOUT WHICH IS

02:03:04.243 --> 02:03:05.411
Q.I. P. --

02:03:05.478 --> 02:03:07.313
AND THAT ADDED ANOTHER TWENTY

02:03:07.379 --> 02:03:09.048
SIX QUALITY MEASURES TO THE ONES

02:03:09.115 --> 02:03:09.648
WE WERE ALREADY LOOKING AT I

02:03:09.715 --> 02:03:12.752
THINK THAT IT SORT OF SPEAKS --

02:03:12.818 --> 02:03:13.853
TO IT THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH YOU

02:03:13.919 --> 02:03:15.321
CAN LEVERAGE AT THE CLINIC LEVEL

02:03:15.387 --> 02:03:16.489
YOU KNOW THEY'RE ALL VERY YOU

02:03:16.555 --> 02:03:17.389
KNOW THEY HAVE THEIR OWN ISSUES

02:03:17.456 --> 02:03:19.125
AND SO TO GO AND TO TRY TO

02:03:19.191 --> 02:03:20.659
ALWAYS HAVE YOUR EYE ON EVERY

02:03:20.726 --> 02:03:21.260
SINGLE BALL.

02:03:21.327 --> 02:03:23.529
AT ONE TIME IS VERY DIFFICULT SO

02:03:23.596 --> 02:03:25.364
I DO AGREE THAT TO SOME EXTENT

02:03:25.431 --> 02:03:27.066
WE HAD BIGGER FISH TO FRY SO THE

02:03:27.133 --> 02:03:28.033
DIABETES THING BECAME SENATE

02:03:28.100 --> 02:03:29.201
SOMEONE THE BACKGROUND BECAUSE

02:03:29.268 --> 02:03:30.569
WE WERE IS DOING WELL ON IT.

02:03:30.636 --> 02:03:31.403
BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S OBVIOUSLY

02:03:31.470 --> 02:03:32.705
COST FOR CONCERN BECAUSE THERE'S

02:03:32.772 --> 02:03:33.606
A LITTLE BIT OF AN UP TICK THERE

02:03:33.672 --> 02:03:36.242
IN THE PERCENT THAT ARE OVER 9%.

02:03:36.308 --> 02:03:37.042
I DO ALSO THINK THAT WE YOU KNOW

02:03:37.109 --> 02:03:38.744
WITH THE DATA HAS ALLOWED US TO

02:03:38.811 --> 02:03:40.546
LOOK AT AT TRI CRITICALLY TO

02:03:40.613 --> 02:03:41.747
FIGURE OUT WHY THERE IS THAT

02:03:41.814 --> 02:03:43.282
I'VE TAKEN WE DO FIND THAT.

02:03:43.349 --> 02:03:44.617
INNER LATINO PATIENTS THEY ARE

02:03:44.683 --> 02:03:47.653
ABOUT 5% HIGHER IN TERMS OF THAT

02:03:47.720 --> 02:03:49.522
UNCONTROLLED DIABETES RATE AND

02:03:49.588 --> 02:03:51.490
SO WE TRY TO ADDRESS THAT BUT

02:03:51.557 --> 02:03:52.558
AGAIN BY CARE COORDINATION BUT

02:03:52.625 --> 02:03:53.893
ALSO.

02:03:53.959 --> 02:03:55.594
OUR GROUP MEDICAL VISITS ARE

02:03:55.661 --> 02:03:56.362
HEAVILY.

02:03:56.428 --> 02:03:57.129
WEIGHTED FOR THE LATINO

02:03:57.196 --> 02:03:58.831
POPULATION WE HAVE A 75% OF THEM

02:03:58.898 --> 02:04:01.667
ARE IN SPANISH SO WE DID TRY. TO

02:04:01.734 --> 02:04:03.102
FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON AND

02:04:03.169 --> 02:04:04.503
ADDRESS THAT MAYBE THAT WASN'T

02:04:04.570 --> 02:04:05.337
ENOUGH IT'S A HARD AND EARLY TO

02:04:05.404 --> 02:04:05.938
TELL.

02:04:06.005 --> 02:04:11.010
BUT I THINK THERE'S A LITTLE BIT

02:04:11.076 --> 02:04:11.577
OF BOTH WHAT YOU'RE TALKING

02:04:11.644 --> 02:04:14.046
ABOUT -- FOR

02:04:14.113 --> 02:04:16.148
PARTNERSHIP HEALTH PLAN A CHIEF

02:04:16.215 --> 02:04:17.716
MEDICAL OFFICER SO WE NEED MAYOR

02:04:17.783 --> 02:04:18.717
OF YOUR MAYBE OUT ON SO MUCH OF

02:04:18.784 --> 02:04:20.386
THE FINANCIAL SIDE WE HEARD

02:04:20.452 --> 02:04:21.587
PREVIOUSLY FROM CALIFORNIA A

02:04:21.654 --> 02:04:23.289
STRIPPER OWN ABOUT THE PREMIUM

02:04:23.355 --> 02:04:24.523
SLIGHT ISSUE.

02:04:24.590 --> 02:04:26.458
THIS FOR THIS WAY I KNOW THAT

02:04:26.525 --> 02:04:27.526
THE HEALTH PLAN IS ALWAYS AND

02:04:27.593 --> 02:04:28.994
THEN PART OF IT'S IN MY DISTRICT

02:04:29.061 --> 02:04:30.396
IS ALWAYS WORKING TO TRY YEAH

02:04:30.462 --> 02:04:31.597
WHATEVER --

02:04:31.664 --> 02:04:33.132
BUT SAME TIME THAT DOES CREATE A

02:04:33.199 --> 02:04:35.434
FINANCIAL DISINCENTIVE IS.

02:04:35.501 --> 02:04:37.670
IS DO YOU FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE

02:04:37.736 --> 02:04:40.639
AND IS IF WE COULD ELIMINATE THE

02:04:40.706 --> 02:04:42.208
PREMIUMS SLIDE WITH THAT HELP

02:04:42.274 --> 02:04:44.176
PROVIDE MORE RESOURCES FOR THE

02:04:44.243 --> 02:04:46.011
HEALTH PLAN TO BE ABLE TO DO

02:04:46.078 --> 02:04:47.112
MORE.

02:04:47.179 --> 02:04:49.281
INNOVATION.

02:04:49.348 --> 02:04:50.082
AND ANY SORT FOCUS MY REMARKS ON

02:04:50.149 --> 02:04:51.550
P. FOR P. I THINK WE WERE TRYING

02:04:51.617 --> 02:04:53.319
TO THINK ABOUT MORE INTEGRATION

02:04:53.385 --> 02:04:55.154
ACO TYPE STUFF.

02:04:55.221 --> 02:04:56.722
IT SOME OF IT MAY BE P. FOR P.

02:04:56.789 --> 02:04:59.258
BUT I MEAN BEYOND THAT BUT I

02:04:59.325 --> 02:05:02.928
MEAN DO YOU DO THAT FINANCIALLY

02:05:02.995 --> 02:05:04.530
I MEAN TO DO ARE THERE SOME OF I

02:05:04.597 --> 02:05:05.831
MEAN ARE YOU DO YOU FEEL LIKE.

02:05:05.898 --> 02:05:07.733
YOU OF LIFE SAFETY OF ALL THE

02:05:07.800 --> 02:05:08.667
MONEY YOU NEED BUT BASICALLY IF

02:05:08.734 --> 02:05:09.768
YOU HAD MORE FINANCIAL RESOURCE

02:05:09.835 --> 02:05:11.070
ARE A BASICALLY YOU HAD A BETTER

02:05:11.136 --> 02:05:11.804
FINANCIAL INCENTIVE WOULD THAT

02:05:11.871 --> 02:05:13.706
CREATE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR

02:05:13.772 --> 02:05:14.640
YOUR HEALTH PLAN OR YOU CAN LIKE

02:05:14.707 --> 02:05:15.541
NO WE RE DID WE'RE DOING

02:05:15.608 --> 02:05:22.047
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO READY.

02:05:22.114 --> 02:05:24.216
AND THAT'S NOT NECESSARY --

02:05:24.283 --> 02:05:25.384
YOU KNOW THE PREVIOUS LIGHT IS

02:05:25.451 --> 02:05:26.285
IS A REAL ISSUE THERE IS ONE

02:05:26.352 --> 02:05:27.253
SLIGHT BUFFER ON THAT WHICH IS

02:05:27.319 --> 02:05:28.320
THAT IF YOU SAVE MONEY IN ONE

02:05:28.387 --> 02:05:29.355
YEAR IT TAKES A COUPLE YEARS

02:05:29.421 --> 02:05:30.522
BEFORE YOU LOSE IT SO YOU GET A

02:05:30.589 --> 02:05:31.490
TRANSIENT BENEFITS IS NOT A LONG

02:05:31.557 --> 02:05:33.092
TERM BUT THAT TRANSIT BENEFIT.

02:05:33.158 --> 02:05:33.993
TO STILL SOME SOME FINANCIAL

02:05:34.059 --> 02:05:34.727
BENEFIT -- A

02:05:34.793 --> 02:05:35.995
GOOD EXAMPLE OF OUR CONCERN

02:05:36.061 --> 02:05:37.429
ABOUT PREVIOUS LIGHT IS THAT THE

02:05:37.496 --> 02:05:40.065
PILOT PROGRAM THE ASIAN CARE

02:05:40.132 --> 02:05:41.433
MANAGEMENT PROGRAM WHICH IS A

02:05:41.500 --> 02:05:42.902
SORT OF A HEALTH HOMES LIKE

02:05:42.968 --> 02:05:44.236
PROGRAM --

02:05:44.303 --> 02:05:46.338
WE WE ARE FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

02:05:46.405 --> 02:05:47.706
SHOWS A FOR EVERY DOLLAR WE

02:05:47.773 --> 02:05:49.408
SPEND WE SAVED ABOUT --

02:05:49.475 --> 02:05:50.843
TWO DOLLARS AND FORTY CENTS ON

02:05:50.910 --> 02:05:52.578
AVERAGE ACROSS THAT PERIOD BUT

02:05:52.645 --> 02:05:53.646
IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR SEVERAL

02:05:53.712 --> 02:05:54.680
YEARS THAT'S ALREADY BUILT BUILT

02:05:54.747 --> 02:05:56.482
INTO OUR RATES WHICH OF YOU KNOW

02:05:56.548 --> 02:05:58.150
GOING DOWN AS RESULT OF THAT SO.

02:05:58.217 --> 02:05:59.218
SO IF WE STOPPED IT THINGS WOULD

02:05:59.285 --> 02:06:00.819
NOW WE LOSE MONEY YOU KNOW SO

02:06:00.886 --> 02:06:02.154
THAT WOULD BE A BAD THING SO

02:06:02.221 --> 02:06:03.789
THAT THAT WOULDN'T BE A GOOD

02:06:03.856 --> 02:06:05.057
BECAUSE IT REDUCES

02:06:05.124 --> 02:06:08.394
HOSPITALIZATION AND SO ON SO --

02:06:08.460 --> 02:06:09.929
SO WE ARE NUMBER PROGRAMS ARE --

02:06:09.995 --> 02:06:10.863
THAT ARE THAT ARE LIKE THAT AND

02:06:10.930 --> 02:06:11.764
THE PALETTE OF KERR PROGRAMS

02:06:11.830 --> 02:06:14.633
ANTHER EXAMPLE THAT --

02:06:14.700 --> 02:06:16.535
PALETTE OF KERR WAS IMPLEMENTED.

02:06:16.602 --> 02:06:17.503
WITH NO ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM

02:06:17.569 --> 02:06:18.837
DHS BECAUSE OF THE WEB PARTLY

02:06:18.904 --> 02:06:19.838
BECAUSE OF THE RESEARCH THAT WE

02:06:19.905 --> 02:06:21.106
DID A PARTNERSHIP SHOWING THAT

02:06:21.173 --> 02:06:23.208
ABOUT A THREE TO ONE OF SAY IS

02:06:23.275 --> 02:06:24.209
THREE DOLLARS SAY FOR EVERY ONE

02:06:24.276 --> 02:06:25.210
DOLLAR SPENT ON PALLIATIVE CARE

02:06:25.277 --> 02:06:26.812
SO THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO

02:06:26.879 --> 02:06:28.080
PROVIDE EXTRA MONEY.

02:06:28.147 --> 02:06:29.581
AGAIN THAT THAT GETS THAT THE

02:06:29.648 --> 02:06:31.917
MONEY THAT SAVE FROM INCREASING

02:06:31.984 --> 02:06:32.685
PALETTE OF KERR IS THERE FOR

02:06:32.751 --> 02:06:33.852
SHORTER TIME THEN IT GOES AWAY

02:06:33.919 --> 02:06:34.520
SO.

02:06:34.586 --> 02:06:35.854
SO IT'S IT'S IT'S AN IMPORTANT

02:06:35.921 --> 02:06:37.923
FACTOR AND DOWN TO THE EXTENT

02:06:37.990 --> 02:06:39.525
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT FOR PROFIT ANY

02:06:39.591 --> 02:06:41.026
MONEY THAT'S LEFT THAT WE HAVE

02:06:41.093 --> 02:06:42.361
IS IS REINVESTED RECENTLY

02:06:42.428 --> 02:06:43.595
INVESTED TWENTY FIVE MILLION

02:06:43.662 --> 02:06:46.799
DOLLARS IN VARIOUS --

02:06:46.865 --> 02:06:50.869
SYNERGISTIC LIVES WE RESET WE

02:06:50.936 --> 02:06:51.971
SUPPORTED --

02:06:52.037 --> 02:06:52.972
WE ACTUALLY ARE SUPPORTING THREE

02:06:53.038 --> 02:06:53.839
DIFFERENT --

02:06:53.906 --> 02:06:55.607
TRANSITIONS PROGRAMS FROM FROM A

02:06:55.674 --> 02:06:57.242
CAR BEING INCARCERATED TO BEING

02:06:57.309 --> 02:06:58.043
BACK OUT IN THE COMMUNITY IN

02:06:58.110 --> 02:06:59.845
TRYING TO TO DECREASE HOSPITAL

02:06:59.912 --> 02:07:01.347
EXPENSES THERE --

02:07:01.413 --> 02:07:02.948
THAT WE WE HAVE A UP FOR A

02:07:03.015 --> 02:07:04.116
COUPLE OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE

02:07:04.183 --> 02:07:05.250
WORKING ON A SOBRE US WITH THE

02:07:05.317 --> 02:07:08.020
CALL SOBRE CENTERS RETARDED --

02:07:08.087 --> 02:07:09.588
SOBER SOBER LIVING SO THEIR

02:07:09.655 --> 02:07:11.390
INNOVATIVE WAYS THAT THAT MONEY

02:07:11.457 --> 02:07:13.192
HAD TO COME FROM THE THE MONEY

02:07:13.258 --> 02:07:14.493
WE SAVE FROM SOMEWHERE THAT THE

02:07:14.560 --> 02:07:15.627
READ THAT THAT THAT WASN'T

02:07:15.694 --> 02:07:16.495
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GONNA GET

02:07:16.562 --> 02:07:17.663
REIMBURSED FOR THOSE PROGRAMS

02:07:17.730 --> 02:07:19.164
FROM THE STATE SO BUT THEN.

02:07:19.231 --> 02:07:20.399
THE QUESTION IS IT WHEN THAT

02:07:20.466 --> 02:07:22.501
EXTRA MONEY GOES AWAY WOULD DO

02:07:22.568 --> 02:07:23.635
TO YOU KNOW DO WE CONTINUE TO

02:07:23.702 --> 02:07:24.803
PROVIDE THAT ARE OR HOW MUCH CAN

02:07:24.870 --> 02:07:26.705
WE DO THAT AND IT EVENTUALLY

02:07:26.772 --> 02:07:27.306
REACH A LIMIT TO HOW MUCH YOU

02:07:27.373 --> 02:07:28.207
CAN DO SO.

02:07:28.273 --> 02:07:31.243
AND THEN ON THE HEALTH HOMES --

02:07:31.310 --> 02:07:33.045
REPRESENT RECORD SO ONE TWO

02:07:33.112 --> 02:07:36.015
WEEKS SO EASE THAT ARE DO YOU

02:07:36.081 --> 02:07:37.816
HAVE DATA YET WHEN YOU EXPECTING

02:07:37.883 --> 02:07:39.218
MY HAVE SOME DATA ABOUT THE

02:07:39.284 --> 02:07:40.986
ABOUT.

02:07:41.053 --> 02:07:44.923
HOW MUCH IMPROVEMENT YOU BAIL

02:07:44.990 --> 02:07:46.825
MADE WITH THIS PROGRAM?

02:07:46.892 --> 02:07:48.527
YEAH I I I THINK YOU KNOW

02:07:48.594 --> 02:07:50.129
LOOKING AT UTILIZATION DATA.

02:07:50.195 --> 02:07:50.929
YOU KNOW THERE'S MORE WE'RE

02:07:50.996 --> 02:07:51.597
STARTING TOGETHER THAT NOW AND I

02:07:51.663 --> 02:07:52.297
WOULD SAY YOU KNOW BY THE END OF

02:07:52.364 --> 02:07:52.965
THE FIRST TWENTY FOUR MONTHS WE

02:07:53.032 --> 02:07:54.400
WE SHOULD HAVE A GOOD IDEA BUT I

02:07:54.466 --> 02:07:57.069
I THINK YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE'S

02:07:57.136 --> 02:07:58.737
THE WAY THE PROGRAM IS

02:07:58.804 --> 02:07:59.605
STRUCTURED NOW.

02:07:59.671 --> 02:08:01.073
YOU KNOW A I THINK THERE WERE

02:08:01.140 --> 02:08:02.708
WERE SOME ASSUMPTIONS MADE THAT

02:08:02.775 --> 02:08:03.675
THAT THE ENROLLMENT NUMBERS

02:08:03.742 --> 02:08:04.777
WOULD COME IN REALLY REALLY

02:08:04.843 --> 02:08:06.378
QUICK SO WE'LL HAVE SOME

02:08:06.445 --> 02:08:08.147
EVALUATION DATA THAT SAYS ON A

02:08:08.213 --> 02:08:09.081
PER MEMBER BASE IS A SERVICE

02:08:09.148 --> 02:08:10.149
FAVES THIS BUT IT'S IT'S NOT

02:08:10.215 --> 02:08:11.417
GOING TO BE LIKE PROGRAM WHY

02:08:11.483 --> 02:08:12.484
WHAT'S.

02:08:12.551 --> 02:08:13.819
THE BIG IMPACT THIS IS HAVING

02:08:13.886 --> 02:08:15.387
AND I THINK EVEN EVEN THE WAY

02:08:15.454 --> 02:08:17.356
THE THE RATES ARE STRUCTURED NOW

02:08:17.423 --> 02:08:18.657
THERE WERE SOME ASSUMPTIONS MADE

02:08:18.724 --> 02:08:18.957
THAT.

02:08:19.024 --> 02:08:19.992
YOU KNOW ALL THE ENROLLMENT

02:08:20.059 --> 02:08:21.660
WOULD OCCUR WITHIN THE FIRST

02:08:21.727 --> 02:08:22.661
TWELVE MONTHS AND THEN HEALTH

02:08:22.728 --> 02:08:24.296
WOOD DRASTICALLY IMPROVED BY THE

02:08:24.363 --> 02:08:25.497
SECOND TWELVE MONTHS AND SO

02:08:25.564 --> 02:08:26.965
THEIR SHIPS AND RATES IN THE

02:08:27.032 --> 02:08:27.699
SECOND YEAR.

02:08:27.766 --> 02:08:29.668
AND WE'RE FINDING THAT THAT'S

02:08:29.735 --> 02:08:32.171
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY GET PEOPLE

02:08:32.237 --> 02:08:34.139
INTO THE PROGRAM --

02:08:34.206 --> 02:08:35.674
ACTUALLY TAKES OVER A REALLY

02:08:35.741 --> 02:08:37.309
LONG TIME AND AND I THINK THAT

02:08:37.376 --> 02:08:38.744
THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE NOT

02:08:38.811 --> 02:08:40.145
JUST FOR TWENTY FOUR MONTHS BUT

02:08:40.212 --> 02:08:41.680
EVEN BEYOND THAT IS WE HAVE

02:08:41.747 --> 02:08:43.082
OTHER YOU KNOW NEW MEMBERS WHO

02:08:43.148 --> 02:08:43.882
WERE GOING TO FALL INTO THE

02:08:43.949 --> 02:08:46.085
ELIGIBILITY PUCK.

02:08:46.151 --> 02:08:47.052
YEAH I MEAN I THINK PEOPLE SIZE

02:08:47.119 --> 02:08:48.520
UNDERESTIMATE.

02:08:48.587 --> 02:08:50.122
HOW MUCH EFFORT TAKES TO MAKE

02:08:50.189 --> 02:08:51.690
CHANGE AND --

02:08:51.757 --> 02:08:53.092
PEOPLE HAVE TO HAVE CONFIDENCE

02:08:53.158 --> 02:08:56.028
IN AND KNOW SOME OF YOU HERE

02:08:56.095 --> 02:08:58.063
RANK CLASS HE SORT.

02:08:58.130 --> 02:08:59.231
OF SO INCOMES THESE AS WE WANT

02:08:59.298 --> 02:09:00.432
TO CHANGE THE WAY YOU DO THINGS

02:09:00.499 --> 02:09:01.567
RIGHT WHETHER IT'S OF THE MAIN

02:09:01.633 --> 02:09:03.102
H. R. L. CHANGING QUALITY AND

02:09:03.168 --> 02:09:03.936
AND THAT THAT TAKES A LOT OF

02:09:04.002 --> 02:09:05.838
WORK TO MAKE THAT TRANSITION.

02:09:05.904 --> 02:09:07.139
I MEAN THAT THERE'S A LOT OF

02:09:07.206 --> 02:09:07.906
THINGS DIFFERENT PEOPLE ARE

02:09:07.973 --> 02:09:09.007
DOING AND THE TEAM WE TALK ABOUT

02:09:09.074 --> 02:09:10.442
TEAM BASED CARE EVERYONE HAS A

02:09:10.509 --> 02:09:11.643
ROLE OF READY IT'S NOT LIKE THEY

02:09:11.710 --> 02:09:12.878
HAVE NOTHING TO DO.

02:09:12.945 --> 02:09:13.812
AND NOW YOU'RE ASKING THINGS TO

02:09:13.879 --> 02:09:15.314
DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY AND HOW DO

02:09:15.380 --> 02:09:16.682

02:09:16.748 --> 02:09:18.117
THE TRAINING AND BE SURE THAT

02:09:18.183 --> 02:09:19.718

THINK WE NEED TO WHEN WE LOOK AT

02:09:30.295 --> 02:09:32.498
THESE THINGS WE ALSO NEED.

02:09:32.564 --> 02:09:33.665
TO FIGURED OUT OUT TO AN AND

02:09:33.732 --> 02:09:34.766
HAVE REASONABLE EXPECTATIONS.

COST AND QUALITY AND I THINK

02:12:31.977 --> 02:12:32.811
WE'VE.

02:12:32.878 --> 02:12:33.812

A LOT OF IT ALREADY IN TERMS OF

02:12:39.584 --> 02:12:40.385
WHAT.

02:12:40.452 --> 02:12:41.586
THE FOUNDATION TALKED ABOUT IN

02:12:41.653 --> 02:12:44.222
SOME OF OUR PLANS BUT WE DO HAVE

02:12:44.289 --> 02:12:46.058
A SET OF THE X. THE THE A. S.

02:12:46.124 --> 02:12:47.526
EXTERNAL ACCOUNTABILITY SET THAT

02:12:47.592 --> 02:12:49.695
WE MEASURE THAT DOES CHANGE

02:12:49.761 --> 02:12:51.129
EVERY YEAR OF WHICH YOU KNOW WE

02:12:51.196 --> 02:12:51.897
DO.

02:12:51.963 --> 02:12:53.332
WORK WITH OUR MANAGER CALL THE

02:12:53.398 --> 02:12:55.133
ADVISORY GROUP TO DETERMINE

02:12:55.200 --> 02:12:56.301
WHICH MEASURES MAKE THE MOST

02:12:56.368 --> 02:12:58.770
SENSE TRY TO HAVE STABILITY BUT

02:12:58.837 --> 02:12:59.538
ALSO MAKE SURE IF THERE'S

02:12:59.604 --> 02:12:59.971
SOMETHING.

02:13:00.038 --> 02:13:02.407
SORT OF IMPORTANT THAT WE'VE

02:13:02.474 --> 02:13:03.041
BEEN MISSING OR SOMETHING WE'RE

02:13:03.108 --> 02:13:03.709
NOT DOING.

02:13:03.775 --> 02:13:05.544
REALLY WELL AND THAT WE FOCUS ON

02:13:05.610 --> 02:13:07.279
THAT WE DO HAVE FOR THE

02:13:07.346 --> 02:13:08.413
REPORTING YOUR TWENTY NINETEEN I

02:13:08.480 --> 02:13:10.315
BELIEVE THERE SEVENTEEN MEASURES

02:13:10.382 --> 02:13:10.982
WITH.

02:13:11.049 --> 02:13:13.418
I THINK TWENTY EIGHT DIFFERENT

02:13:13.485 --> 02:13:15.587
ELEMENTS TOTAL SOMETHING LIKE

02:13:15.654 --> 02:13:18.123
THAT -- YOU

02:13:18.190 --> 02:13:21.360
KNOW SORT OF SPANNING SOME OF

02:13:21.426 --> 02:13:24.196
THE DIABETES STUFF THEY SOME OF

02:13:24.262 --> 02:13:25.764
THE OTHER FOLKS TALK ABOUT.

02:13:25.831 --> 02:13:27.666
SO WE DO HAVE THAT THAT WE HOLD

02:13:27.733 --> 02:13:30.068
PLANS ACCOUNTABLE --

02:13:30.135 --> 02:13:32.471
TO YOU HEARD A CHRIS TALK ABOUT

02:13:32.537 --> 02:13:34.439
THE PERFORMANCE DASHBOARDS THAT

02:13:34.506 --> 02:13:35.340
WE PUT OUT THAT I KNOW WE'VE

02:13:35.407 --> 02:13:36.808
SHARED AND TALK ABOUT WITH YOU

02:13:36.875 --> 02:13:38.443
BEFORE -- I

02:13:38.510 --> 02:13:39.845
THINK AS MANY FOLKS OF MENTION

02:13:39.911 --> 02:13:42.280
WE SIR WE HAVE CERTAINLY RAMPED

02:13:42.347 --> 02:13:44.149
UP OUR EFFORTS IN THIS AREA --

02:13:44.216 --> 02:13:45.317
IN WAYS THAT I'M PARTICULARLY

02:13:45.384 --> 02:13:46.718
PROUD OF AND I THINK THAT'S

02:13:46.785 --> 02:13:48.453
DEFINITELY BEEN TRUE OVER THAT.

02:13:48.520 --> 02:13:49.454
THE TIME SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE

02:13:49.521 --> 02:13:51.256
REALLY SEEING A SHIFT IN

02:13:51.323 --> 02:13:53.392
FOCUSING ON NOT ONLY MONITORING

02:13:53.458 --> 02:13:54.126
AND TRACKING THE QUALITY BUT

02:13:54.192 --> 02:13:55.660
REALLY BEING ABLE TO SHARE THAT

02:13:55.727 --> 02:13:56.962
OUT SO THAT WE CAN.

02:13:57.028 --> 02:13:58.263
HAVE TRANSPARENCY ABOUT THAT AND

02:13:58.330 --> 02:14:00.031
HAVE FOLKS UNDERSTAND WHERE

02:14:00.098 --> 02:14:01.133
WE'RE DOING WELL AND WHERE WE

02:14:01.199 --> 02:14:03.602
MAY BE STRUGGLING AND HOW DO WE

02:14:03.668 --> 02:14:05.437
HOW DO WE CORRECT THAT AND SO.

02:14:05.504 --> 02:14:06.438
USING THAT THOSE DATA WE DO WORK

02:14:06.505 --> 02:14:07.339
WITH OUR PLANS AND AGAIN YOU

02:14:07.406 --> 02:14:08.440
HEARD FOLKS TALK ABOUT THEIR

02:14:08.507 --> 02:14:10.108
QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS AT

02:14:10.175 --> 02:14:11.710
THE REQUIRED TO DO --

02:14:11.777 --> 02:14:12.778
AND AND MAKING SURE THAT THEIR

02:14:12.844 --> 02:14:14.479
MEETING THOSE THOSE METRICS

02:14:14.546 --> 02:14:17.215
OBVIOUSLY WHEN PLANS ARE NOT.

02:14:17.282 --> 02:14:18.650
BUT PERFORMING TO THE THE

02:14:18.717 --> 02:14:20.185
STANDARD THAT WE SET WE DO WE

02:14:20.252 --> 02:14:21.686
HAVE BEGUN ISSUING SANCTIONS I

02:14:21.753 --> 02:14:22.354
THINK.

02:14:22.421 --> 02:14:23.722
YOU WILL CONTINUE TO SEE US USE

02:14:23.789 --> 02:14:26.191
THAT AS A TOOL WE HAVE SEEN I

02:14:26.258 --> 02:14:27.025
THINK --

02:14:27.092 --> 02:14:28.593
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IT BE VERY

02:14:28.660 --> 02:14:29.561
USEFUL.

02:14:29.628 --> 02:14:31.997
IN CORRECTING ISSUES --

02:14:32.063 --> 02:14:34.332
SO NOT THAT WE LIKE TO PENALIZE.

02:14:34.399 --> 02:14:35.400
PLEASE PEOPLE BUT IN TERMS OF IT

02:14:35.467 --> 02:14:38.537
REALLY BECAUSE START GETTING

02:14:38.603 --> 02:14:40.172
ATTENTION OF OF LEADERSHIP IN

02:14:40.238 --> 02:14:42.174
THOSE VARIOUS AREAS TEND TO MAKE

02:14:42.240 --> 02:14:44.776
SURE THAT WE'RE ADDRESSING THOSE --

02:14:44.843 --> 02:14:45.644
IT SO IF YOU KNOW FROM A COST

02:14:45.710 --> 02:14:47.412
PERSPECTIVE WE DID AS YOU

02:14:47.479 --> 02:14:50.248
MENTIONED YOU HAD THE COSTA.

02:14:50.315 --> 02:14:51.283
BECOMES RATE SETTING --

02:14:51.349 --> 02:14:56.988
A HEARING LAST YEAR I THINK I

02:14:57.055 --> 02:14:58.890
FEELS LIKE EVERY YEAR WHO WHO

02:14:58.957 --> 02:15:00.892
NOT SOMETIME --

02:15:00.959 --> 02:15:02.761
AND SO WE DO OBVIOUSLY IT

02:15:02.828 --> 02:15:03.962
CAPTURE THE COST INFORMATION I

02:15:04.029 --> 02:15:04.963
THINK AS AS AS FOLKS TALKED

02:15:05.030 --> 02:15:05.864
ABOUT IT'S ALWAYS A CHALLENGE

02:15:05.931 --> 02:15:07.132
AND I THINK YOU KNOW AS AS YOU

02:15:07.199 --> 02:15:07.699
MENTIONED AND OTHERS HAVE

02:15:07.766 --> 02:15:07.999
MENTIONED.

02:15:08.066 --> 02:15:08.733
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:15:08.800 --> 02:15:10.268
MANAGED CARE AND --

02:15:10.335 --> 02:15:11.403
REALLY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE

02:15:11.470 --> 02:15:13.104
HEAVILY CAPITATED NATURE EVEN

02:15:13.171 --> 02:15:14.406
NOT JUST US TO THE PLANS BUT AS

02:15:14.473 --> 02:15:16.174
YOU KNOW PLANS TO PROVIDER

02:15:16.241 --> 02:15:17.275
GROUPS AND AND OTHER.

02:15:17.342 --> 02:15:19.110
DELEGATED ENTITIES AND SO REALLY

02:15:19.177 --> 02:15:20.745
IT'S A VERY HEAVILY DELEGATED A

02:15:20.812 --> 02:15:22.647
CAPITATED SYSTEM AND NOT A FEE

02:15:22.714 --> 02:15:24.182
FOR SERVICE SYSTEM --

02:15:24.249 --> 02:15:25.784
AND SO IT SO THAT'S WHY THAT

02:15:25.851 --> 02:15:26.918
INFORMATION ON TO ABOUT PER

02:15:26.985 --> 02:15:28.820
SERVICE COST ISN'T AVAILABLE

02:15:28.887 --> 02:15:30.155
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT HOW ANYONE'S

02:15:30.222 --> 02:15:32.724
PAID BUT SERVE OVERALL OBVIOUSLY

02:15:32.791 --> 02:15:34.326
WE TRACK COST AND WE DO DO A FEW

02:15:34.392 --> 02:15:35.694
THINGS IN THE RIGHT SETTING THAT

02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:37.062
THAT WE SHARED FOR IN TERMS OF

02:15:37.128 --> 02:15:38.230
SOME OFFICIALS THE ADJUSTMENTS.

02:15:38.296 --> 02:15:39.731
RELATED TO PHARMACY AND

02:15:39.798 --> 02:15:40.232
POTENTIALLY PREVENTABLE

02:15:40.298 --> 02:15:43.201
ADMISSIONS --

02:15:43.268 --> 02:15:43.768
TO TRY TO DRIVE SOME OF THAT

02:15:43.835 --> 02:15:47.672
THAT BUT CERTAIN BENCHMARKS OF

02:15:47.739 --> 02:15:48.440
OF MAKING SURE THEY'RE BEING

02:15:48.507 --> 02:15:50.075
ANSWERED MOST EFFICIENT IN IN

02:15:50.141 --> 02:15:51.743
THOSE AREAS AND WE CONTINUE TO

02:15:51.810 --> 02:15:53.845
LOOK AT WAYS --

02:15:53.912 --> 02:15:55.580
TO FURTHER THAT AND FIGURE OUT

02:15:55.647 --> 02:15:57.215
HOW DO WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO

02:15:57.282 --> 02:15:59.050
DRIVE MORE VALUE.

02:15:59.117 --> 02:16:00.018
AND I THINK --

02:16:00.085 --> 02:16:01.286
BLESSING I'D SAY BEFORE TURNING

02:16:01.353 --> 02:16:02.220
OVER CITY SEE BECAUSE SHE'S

02:16:02.287 --> 02:16:04.022
GOING TO TALK A LOT ABOUT SOME

02:16:04.089 --> 02:16:04.689
OF THE STUFF THAT WE'RE THINKING

02:16:04.756 --> 02:16:05.657
ABOUT DOING --

02:16:05.724 --> 02:16:07.058
BUT I WOULD SAY THAT WE REALLY

02:16:07.125 --> 02:16:10.095
ARE LOOKING AT THE END OF THIS

02:16:10.161 --> 02:16:12.764
WAIVER AND SORT OF THE START OF

02:16:12.831 --> 02:16:13.331
TWENTY TWENTY ONE BEING AN

02:16:13.398 --> 02:16:14.666
OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY HAVE A

02:16:14.733 --> 02:16:16.067
CONVERSATION ABOUT.

02:16:16.134 --> 02:16:18.470
HOW MUCH HOW CAN HOW CAN WE PUSH

02:16:18.537 --> 02:16:20.005
MORE CHANGE IN HOW WE CAN WE

02:16:20.071 --> 02:16:21.673
FOCUS MORE ON VALUE IN QUALITY?

02:16:21.740 --> 02:16:22.741
AND SO THAT'S WHAT YOU SEE WILL

02:16:22.807 --> 02:16:24.042
TALK ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE AREAS

02:16:24.109 --> 02:16:24.976
WERE THINKING ABOUT AND

02:16:25.043 --> 02:16:27.178
CERTAINLY WORKING WITH FOLKS ON

02:16:27.245 --> 02:16:28.346
ON THOSE IDEAS AS WE GO THROUGH

02:16:28.413 --> 02:16:30.982
SORT OF THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS.

02:16:31.049 --> 02:16:31.583
TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS NOT THAT

02:16:31.650 --> 02:16:35.720
FAR AWAY.

02:16:35.787 --> 02:16:37.455
THANK YOU WILLOW GOOD AFTERNOON --

02:16:37.522 --> 02:16:39.357
SO I THINK YOU KNOW THERE WERE --

02:16:39.424 --> 02:16:40.225
WE'RE CONVERSATIONS EARLIER

02:16:40.292 --> 02:16:41.393
AROUND STRATEGIES AND THINGS WE

02:16:41.459 --> 02:16:42.661
CAN IMPLEMENT TO IMPROVE CARE

02:16:42.727 --> 02:16:43.962
COORDINATION AND CHRONIC DISEASE

02:16:44.029 --> 02:16:45.931
MANAGEMENT I THINK ONE OF OUR

02:16:45.997 --> 02:16:47.632
GOALS OUR MAIN GOALS IS TO AS

02:16:47.699 --> 02:16:49.067
MENTIONED BEFORE ENSURE THAT ANY

02:16:49.134 --> 02:16:50.468
BENEFICIARY REGARDLESS OF WHERE

02:16:50.535 --> 02:16:51.870
THE RECEIVING CARE IN THE STATE

02:16:51.937 --> 02:16:53.572
IS GETTING CONSISTENT CARE --

02:16:53.638 --> 02:16:55.140
AND THAT IS PREDICTABLE --

02:16:55.206 --> 02:16:56.441
AND THAT THAT CARE DOESN'T

02:16:56.508 --> 02:16:57.409
CHANGE THAT THEIR HEALTH OUTCOME

02:16:57.475 --> 02:16:59.844
JUST BY BASED ON WHERE THEY LIVE --

02:16:59.911 --> 02:17:01.680
AND SO THE DEPARTMENT IS LOOKING

02:17:01.746 --> 02:17:05.417
AT A NUMBER OF OPPORTUNITIES. TO

02:17:05.483 --> 02:17:08.420
EXPLORE FOR FUTURE CHANGES IN

02:17:08.486 --> 02:17:09.354
WHICH MEANT AMEND TODAY ALL WALK

02:17:09.421 --> 02:17:12.257
THROUGH THREE STRATEGIES THAT WE

02:17:12.324 --> 02:17:13.558
CAN LOOK INTO --

02:17:13.625 --> 02:17:14.893
SO THE FIRST ONE WOULD BE

02:17:14.960 --> 02:17:16.394
LOOKING INTO IDENTIFYING MEMBER

02:17:16.461 --> 02:17:17.996
RISK IN NEED THROUGH MORE

02:17:18.063 --> 02:17:19.030
POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT

02:17:19.097 --> 02:17:20.265
STRATEGIES AND TARGETED

02:17:20.332 --> 02:17:21.499
INTERVENTIONS.

02:17:21.566 --> 02:17:22.801
ON THE SECOND ONE IS REDUCING

02:17:22.867 --> 02:17:24.603
VARIATION AND COMPLEXITY ACROSS

02:17:24.669 --> 02:17:26.571
THE SYSTEM AND THE LAST ONE IS

02:17:26.638 --> 02:17:27.639
LOOKING AT IMPLEMENTING

02:17:27.706 --> 02:17:29.007
INCENTIVES --

02:17:29.074 --> 02:17:30.308
THAT WOULD IMPROVE HEALTH

02:17:30.375 --> 02:17:31.810
OUTCOMES IN SUPPORT VALUE BASED

02:17:31.876 --> 02:17:32.744
PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS ARE SHARED

02:17:32.811 --> 02:17:34.746
SAVINGS MODELS SO GO INTO EACH

02:17:34.813 --> 02:17:37.983
OF THOSE THREE ITEMS A QUICKLY --

02:17:38.049 --> 02:17:39.184
SO AS THE DEPARTMENT LOOKED AT

02:17:39.250 --> 02:17:40.452
THOSE OPPORTUNITIES THE FIRST

02:17:40.518 --> 02:17:41.620
ONE REALLY BEING AT HOW DO WE

02:17:41.686 --> 02:17:43.722
BETTER IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS THAT

02:17:43.788 --> 02:17:45.357
NEED THE SERVICES.

02:17:45.423 --> 02:17:46.424
I THINK WE WANT TO LOOK AT OUR

02:17:46.491 --> 02:17:47.892
CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS IN

02:17:47.959 --> 02:17:49.828
LANGUAGE TO SEE HOW CAN WE

02:17:49.894 --> 02:17:50.729
TIGHTEN UP --

02:17:50.795 --> 02:17:51.963
LANGUAGE AROUND CARE

02:17:52.030 --> 02:17:53.665
COORDINATION DISEASE ON CHRONIC

02:17:53.732 --> 02:17:55.400
DISEASE MANAGEMENT TO ENSURE IT

02:17:55.467 --> 02:17:56.868
IS APPROPRIATE MAKE SHIRTS

02:17:56.935 --> 02:17:57.802
MEASURABLE --

02:17:57.869 --> 02:17:59.104
AND TO ENSURE THAT DATA

02:17:59.170 --> 02:18:00.705
ANALYTICS ARE BEING USED TO

02:18:00.772 --> 02:18:03.041
DRIVE CLINICAL DCISION MAKING --

02:18:03.108 --> 02:18:04.376
SPECIFICALLY AROUND HOW WE

02:18:04.442 --> 02:18:06.211
IDENTIFY TARGET POPULATIONS

02:18:06.277 --> 02:18:07.078
WITHIN --

02:18:07.145 --> 02:18:08.113
THE PLANS AND THEN HOW

02:18:08.179 --> 02:18:09.814
INTERVENTIONS ARE BEING TIED TO

02:18:09.881 --> 02:18:11.416
THOSE POPULATIONS AND HEALTH

02:18:11.483 --> 02:18:12.951
PLANS ARE INCENTIVIZING NOW ON

02:18:13.018 --> 02:18:14.152
THE DOWNSTREAM TO THINK THERE'S

02:18:14.219 --> 02:18:15.887
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO LOOK AT

02:18:15.954 --> 02:18:16.788
THE CONTRACT.

02:18:16.855 --> 02:18:18.523
WHERE YOU DO SEE A DOCTOR MORE

02:18:18.590 --> 02:18:20.125
TODAY GIVE SOME GREAT EXAMPLES

02:18:20.191 --> 02:18:23.862
OF PLANS DOING THAT --

02:18:23.928 --> 02:18:24.462
THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR TO

02:18:24.529 --> 02:18:27.065
LOOK AT THE CAR CROSS THE STATE

02:18:27.132 --> 02:18:30.268
FOR SOME PLANS ARE THAT AND SOME

02:18:30.335 --> 02:18:31.269
ARE NOT --

02:18:31.336 --> 02:18:32.871
AND SO THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY

02:18:32.937 --> 02:18:34.105
TO LOOK AT THAT INFORMATION AND

02:18:34.172 --> 02:18:35.774
TO PROVIDE.

02:18:35.840 --> 02:18:37.642
RECOMMENDATIONS IN THAT AREA --

02:18:37.709 --> 02:18:39.244
THE OTHER THING IS WE WOULD LIKE

02:18:39.310 --> 02:18:40.745
TO LOOK AT OUR PROCESSES FOR HOW

02:18:40.812 --> 02:18:42.047
WE CURRENTLY SCREEN AND ASSESS

02:18:42.113 --> 02:18:43.682
SCHOOL RISKY NEED AS WELL AS

02:18:43.748 --> 02:18:44.983
LOOKING AT SOCIAL DETERMINANTS

02:18:45.050 --> 02:18:46.351
OF HEALTH --

02:18:46.418 --> 02:18:48.053
TO BETTER TARGET APPROPRIATE

02:18:48.119 --> 02:18:49.788
INTERVENTIONS --

02:18:49.854 --> 02:18:51.322
FOR OUR MEDICARE POPULATION I

02:18:51.389 --> 02:18:52.724
THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY OUR

02:18:52.791 --> 02:18:55.160
POPULATION IS MAYBE DIFFERENT --

02:18:55.226 --> 02:18:57.028
THEN ALL OF THE OTHER AREAS

02:18:57.095 --> 02:18:57.929
TODAY -- AND

02:18:57.996 --> 02:18:59.030
THERE ARE UNIQUE INTERVENTIONS

02:18:59.097 --> 02:19:00.165
THAT NEED TO BE PUT IN PLACE TO

02:19:00.231 --> 02:19:01.466
ENSURE THAT THEY'RE GETTING THE

02:19:01.533 --> 02:19:03.868
SERVICES THAT THEY NEED --

02:19:03.935 --> 02:19:04.536
AND THAT GETS TO THE THE LARGER

02:19:04.602 --> 02:19:06.404
THOUGH THE LAST PART OF THIS

02:19:06.471 --> 02:19:08.306
PARTICULAR ONE IDENTIFYING USING

02:19:08.373 --> 02:19:09.841
DATA ANALYSTS TO DRIVE WHO ARE

02:19:09.908 --> 02:19:11.509
THE TARGET POPULATIONS THAT ARE

02:19:11.576 --> 02:19:13.011
NEEDED FOR THIS CARE WHO ARE

02:19:13.078 --> 02:19:14.412
HIGH RISK --

02:19:14.479 --> 02:19:16.147
ARE THE HIGH NEED POPULATIONS --

02:19:16.214 --> 02:19:16.715
BUT THEN THERE'S THE

02:19:16.781 --> 02:19:18.183
INTERVENTION PARDON TO THE

02:19:18.249 --> 02:19:19.851
DEPARTMENT DOES KNOW THAT WE MAY

02:19:19.918 --> 02:19:21.152
NEED TO LOOK AT OPPORTUNITIES.

02:19:21.219 --> 02:19:23.588
UP HERE --

02:19:23.655 --> 02:19:24.189
YOU HEARD SOME AMAZING THINGS

02:19:24.255 --> 02:19:26.958
ARE CARE COORDINATION HANSEN

02:19:27.025 --> 02:19:31.162
SAID FOR US TO LOOK AT OTHER

02:19:31.229 --> 02:19:32.330
OPPORTUNITIES AROUND EVEN

02:19:32.397 --> 02:19:34.065
SOLUTIONS OUTSIDE OF THE FOUR

02:19:34.132 --> 02:19:35.300
WALLS OF A CLINIC --

02:19:35.366 --> 02:19:36.868
WE HAVE SEEN GREAT --

02:19:36.935 --> 02:19:39.170
INNOVATIONS IN WHOLE PERSON CARE --

02:19:39.237 --> 02:19:40.772
SOME VERY GREAT THINGS IN A

02:19:40.839 --> 02:19:42.006
PRIMARY CARE CLINICS WHICH IS

02:19:42.073 --> 02:19:43.575
VERY IMPORTANT BUT ALSO REACHING

02:19:43.641 --> 02:19:44.943
OUT TO INDIVIDUALS OUTSIDE OF

02:19:45.009 --> 02:19:46.578
THE FOUR WALLS OF THE CLINIC.

02:19:46.644 --> 02:19:47.812
INTO THE COMMUNITY --

02:19:47.879 --> 02:19:49.647
WE'VE SEEN VERY EFFECTIVE USE OF

02:19:49.714 --> 02:19:51.516
THAT THROUGH WHOLE PERSON CARE

02:19:51.583 --> 02:19:52.617
I'M AND HOW DO WE SKILLED THAT

02:19:52.684 --> 02:19:55.386
UP NOT JUST TO HOLD PERSON CARE --

02:19:55.453 --> 02:19:56.154
LEAD ENTITIES --

02:19:56.221 --> 02:19:57.689
BUT ACROSS ACROSS OUR MEDI CAL

02:19:57.756 --> 02:19:58.957
POPULATION --

02:19:59.023 --> 02:20:00.158
IS SOMETHING THAT THE DEPARTMENT

02:20:00.225 --> 02:20:02.260
IS VERY INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT

02:20:02.327 --> 02:20:03.661
AND THAT INCLUDES THINGS LIKE

02:20:03.728 --> 02:20:03.895
LEE --

02:20:03.962 --> 02:20:05.897
HOUSING LIAISON SERVICES POST

02:20:05.964 --> 02:20:07.766
INCARCERATION PEER SUPPORT A

02:20:07.832 --> 02:20:10.068
VARIETY OF INTERVENTIONS THAT

02:20:10.135 --> 02:20:11.536
HAVE BEEN TESTED --

02:20:11.603 --> 02:20:13.104
HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE THINK ARE

02:20:13.171 --> 02:20:14.906
VERY PROMISING TO LOOK AT FOR

02:20:14.973 --> 02:20:16.741
FUTURE.

02:20:16.808 --> 02:20:17.675
OPPORTUNITIES --

02:20:17.742 --> 02:20:19.544
AS OF RIGHT NOW THOSE ARE ONLY

02:20:19.611 --> 02:20:21.246
AVAILABLE IN CERTAIN COUNTIES --

02:20:21.312 --> 02:20:24.149
AND SO THE IDEA WAS BE HOW WOULD

02:20:24.215 --> 02:20:26.584
WE BE ABLE TO HIGHER STATE FOR

02:20:26.651 --> 02:20:30.088
HE'S AROUND IN LIEU OF SERVICES

02:20:30.155 --> 02:20:32.056
SO THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO

02:20:32.123 --> 02:20:33.892
LOOK AT IN LIEU OF SERVICES --

02:20:33.958 --> 02:20:35.260
TO IDENTIFIED MEDICALLY

02:20:35.326 --> 02:20:37.462
APPROPRIATE AND COST EFFECTIVE --

02:20:37.529 --> 02:20:39.531
SOLUTIONS THAT WOULD ESSENTIALLY

02:20:39.597 --> 02:20:40.732
BE ABLE TO SUBSTITUTE EXISTING

02:20:40.799 --> 02:20:42.967
STATE PLAN BENEFITS --

02:20:43.034 --> 02:20:44.269
ONE VERY GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS IS

02:20:44.335 --> 02:20:46.237
RECRUITED OF CARE SO --

02:20:46.304 --> 02:20:47.772
A LARGE NUMBER OF OUR WHOLE

02:20:47.839 --> 02:20:49.607
PERSON CARE PILOTS HAVE

02:20:49.674 --> 02:20:51.342
IMPLEMENTED RECUPERATIVE CARE.

02:20:51.409 --> 02:20:53.645
IN IT IS A VERY EFFECTIVE IN

02:20:53.711 --> 02:20:55.013
ORDER TO GET SOMEONE WHO MAY BE

02:20:55.079 --> 02:20:56.614
HOMELESS WHO'S IN AN EMERGENCY

02:20:56.681 --> 02:20:58.383
ROOM AN INPATIENT SETTING.

02:20:58.449 --> 02:21:00.084
OUT OF THAT HOSPITAL ENVIRONMENT

02:21:00.151 --> 02:21:01.686
IN INTO A LOWER LEVEL BUT NOT

02:21:01.753 --> 02:21:02.954
GOING TO THE STREETS THAT THEY

02:21:03.021 --> 02:21:04.255
DON'T HAVE STABLE HOUSING

02:21:04.322 --> 02:21:05.390
LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO

02:21:05.456 --> 02:21:08.560
FIND THEM SOMEWHERE TO GO SAFELY --

02:21:08.626 --> 02:21:09.794
FOR WHATEVER PERIOD OF TIME IS

02:21:09.861 --> 02:21:12.163
NECESSARY --

02:21:12.230 --> 02:21:12.730
TO TO LOOK AT OPPORTUNITIES

02:21:12.797 --> 02:21:14.165
THERE SO THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS

02:21:14.232 --> 02:21:15.567
LOOKING AT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES

02:21:15.633 --> 02:21:17.602
AS WE LOOK AT THE WAIVER RENEWAL

02:21:17.669 --> 02:21:18.503
AND WE LEARN FROM THESE WHOLE

02:21:18.570 --> 02:21:19.637
PERSON CARE PILOTS ABOUT WHAT

02:21:19.704 --> 02:21:21.706
CAN BE SCALED UP IN WHAT WE CAN

02:21:21.773 --> 02:21:24.309
BUILD WITHIN THE THE CONFINES OF

02:21:24.375 --> 02:21:25.610
FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS.

02:21:25.677 --> 02:21:26.544
THE NEXT ONE IS LOOKING AT

02:21:26.611 --> 02:21:28.913
REDUCING VARIATION IN COMPLEX A

02:21:28.980 --> 02:21:30.782
COMPLEXITY ACROSS THE SYSTEM --

02:21:30.849 --> 02:21:32.283
SO AS YOU WOULD IMAGINE CARE

02:21:32.350 --> 02:21:33.384
COORDINATION CAN BE VERY

02:21:33.451 --> 02:21:35.386
UNPREDICTABLE IF THE SYSTEM IS

02:21:35.453 --> 02:21:36.821
VERY COMPLICATED --

02:21:36.888 --> 02:21:38.890
AND SO IT IS WHY ONE OF THE

02:21:38.957 --> 02:21:43.094
REASONS HAITIAN ACROSS CAL --

02:21:43.161 --> 02:21:44.963
AS WAS MENTIONED IN A VARIETY OF

02:21:45.029 --> 02:21:46.164
WAYS TODAY --

02:21:46.231 --> 02:21:47.332
IF YOU'RE IN ONE COUNTY IT CAN

02:21:47.398 --> 02:21:48.099
BE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE

02:21:48.166 --> 02:21:49.767
COUNTY NEXT YOU AND SOMETIMES

02:21:49.834 --> 02:21:50.902
EVEN FROM ONE PLAN TO THE OTHER

02:21:50.969 --> 02:21:52.470
EVEN SAW THAT WITH SOME OF THE

02:21:52.537 --> 02:21:54.439
REMARKS CHRIS MADE TODAY --

02:21:54.505 --> 02:21:55.707
SO WE ARE LOOKING AT WAYS TO

02:21:55.773 --> 02:21:56.708
LOOK AT THAT THERE'S THREE MAIN

02:21:56.774 --> 02:21:58.176
AREAS WHERE WE THINK WE COULD

02:21:58.243 --> 02:21:59.711
FOCUS ON THAT VARIATION.

02:21:59.777 --> 02:22:00.645
ON THE FIRST ONE IS WHERE

02:22:00.712 --> 02:22:02.447
BENEFITS ARE ADMINISTERED IN THE

02:22:02.513 --> 02:22:03.615
DELIVERY SYSTEM --

02:22:03.681 --> 02:22:05.250
SO IT'S OBVIOUSLY A LARGER LOOK

02:22:05.316 --> 02:22:06.584
BUT REVIEWING WHAT IS CARVED IN

02:22:06.651 --> 02:22:07.719
AND OUT OF MANAGED CARE

02:22:07.785 --> 02:22:08.853
SOMETHING THE DEPARTMENT IS

02:22:08.920 --> 02:22:10.221
INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT FOR

02:22:10.288 --> 02:22:11.489
EXAMPLE LONG TERM CARE

02:22:11.556 --> 02:22:13.024
TRANSPLANT OR OTHER LARGER

02:22:13.091 --> 02:22:14.058
THINGS LIKE MENTAL HEALTH AND

02:22:14.125 --> 02:22:15.026
SHE DE OF COURSE.

02:22:15.093 --> 02:22:17.595
BUT LOOKING ACROSS THE SYSTEM.

02:22:17.662 --> 02:22:19.163
THE OTHERS IS FUNDING SILOS THAT

02:22:19.230 --> 02:22:21.366
HAVE CREATED SYSTEM DELIVERY

02:22:21.432 --> 02:22:22.700
SYSTEM IN EQUITIES --

02:22:22.767 --> 02:22:23.635
IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE

02:22:23.701 --> 02:22:25.503
COULD REALLY LOOK INTO TO FIGURE

02:22:25.570 --> 02:22:27.505
OUT HOW TO TO DRIVE SOME

02:22:27.572 --> 02:22:28.907
POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES.

02:22:28.973 --> 02:22:30.742
ON THE OTHER IS ENROLLMENT IN

02:22:30.808 --> 02:22:32.744
MANAGED CARE SO --

02:22:32.810 --> 02:22:34.012
REVIEWING EIGHT CODES

02:22:34.078 --> 02:22:35.480
POPULATIONS ZIP CODES WE STILL

02:22:35.546 --> 02:22:38.349
HAVE PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE --

02:22:38.416 --> 02:22:39.884
MANAGED CARE IS NOT THE MAIN

02:22:39.951 --> 02:22:42.020
DELIVERY SYSTEM OR THE REQUIRED

02:22:42.086 --> 02:22:43.121
DELIVERY SYSTEM --

02:22:43.187 --> 02:22:44.722
AND LASTLY IN REGARDS TO

02:22:44.789 --> 02:22:46.557
VARIATION IS INCREASING PARITY

02:22:46.624 --> 02:22:47.926
IN THE OVERSIGHT AND MONITORING

02:22:47.992 --> 02:22:49.727
ACROSS OUR DELIVERY SYSTEM SO

02:22:49.794 --> 02:22:50.762
NOT JUST ON THE MANAGED CARE

02:22:50.828 --> 02:22:51.062
PLAN.

02:22:51.129 --> 02:22:54.499
PLAN SIDE BUT ON THE MENTAL

02:22:54.565 --> 02:22:56.034
HEALTH AS SHE DE INTO TO ENSURE

02:22:56.100 --> 02:22:59.737
WE HAVE THE SAME MONITORING THEN

02:22:59.804 --> 02:23:01.072
THE LAST IS LOOKING AT

02:23:01.139 --> 02:23:02.774
OPPORTUNITIES AROUND --

02:23:02.840 --> 02:23:04.375
IMPLEMENTING INCENTIVES --

02:23:04.442 --> 02:23:05.476
THAT IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES IN

02:23:05.543 --> 02:23:06.878
SUPPORT VALUE BASED PAYMENT

02:23:06.945 --> 02:23:07.879
ARRANGEMENTS AND SHARED SAVINGS

02:23:07.946 --> 02:23:09.213
MODELS OF THE DEPARTMENT IS VERY

02:23:09.280 --> 02:23:11.416
OPEN. TO HAVING CONVERSATIONS

02:23:11.482 --> 02:23:12.784
AROUND OPPORTUNITIES IN THE

02:23:12.850 --> 02:23:13.818
SPACE --

02:23:13.885 --> 02:23:15.386
SPECIFICALLY AROUND THINGS LIKE

02:23:15.453 --> 02:23:16.754
PRIME YOU HEARD I TALKED ABOUT

02:23:16.821 --> 02:23:18.790
TODAY HOW DO WE TAKE PRIME WHICH

02:23:18.856 --> 02:23:20.792
HAS BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE IN OUR

02:23:20.858 --> 02:23:22.527
PUBLIC AND DISTRICT HOSPITALS TO

02:23:22.593 --> 02:23:24.195
SCALE UP ACROSS THE STATE --

02:23:24.262 --> 02:23:25.797
AS WELL AS LOOK AT MORE RISK

02:23:25.863 --> 02:23:27.598
BASED ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MODELS --

02:23:27.665 --> 02:23:29.033
SURE SAVINGS MODELS IN OTHER

02:23:29.100 --> 02:23:30.368
RATE CHANGES SO I THINK THE

02:23:30.435 --> 02:23:31.669
DEPARTMENT IS VERY OPEN TO THOSE

02:23:31.736 --> 02:23:33.004
OPPORTUNITIES --

02:23:33.071 --> 02:23:34.238
AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND LOOK AT

02:23:34.305 --> 02:23:35.373
THINGS LIKE PROP FIFTY SIX AS

02:23:35.440 --> 02:23:36.708
MERRY MENTIONED OTHER DIRECTED

02:23:36.774 --> 02:23:39.377
PAYMENTS OR OTHER OPPORTUNITIES.

02:23:39.444 --> 02:23:40.678
FOR CREATIVE FINANCING TO DRIVE

02:23:40.745 --> 02:23:43.381
THE INTENDED OUTCOMES AND CLOSE

02:23:43.448 --> 02:23:45.917
THOSE GAPS SO.

02:23:45.984 --> 02:23:46.851
SO JUST TO BUILD ON TO THAT TO

02:23:46.918 --> 02:23:47.518
ADDRESS A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT

02:23:47.585 --> 02:23:49.020
WERE MENTIONED OBVIOUSLY --

02:23:49.087 --> 02:23:51.255
THE FOUNDATIONS REPORT IN TERMS

02:23:51.322 --> 02:23:53.925
OF THE SHARED SAVINGS MODEL --

02:23:53.992 --> 02:23:54.993
AS I CAN'T MEMBER CHRISTMAS AND

02:23:55.059 --> 02:23:56.761
MENTIONED I WAS AN ADVISER ON

02:23:56.828 --> 02:23:57.862
THAT GROUP OBVIOUSLY NOT A

02:23:57.929 --> 02:24:00.598
MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE AND NOT.

02:24:00.665 --> 02:24:02.233
PART OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS BUT

02:24:02.300 --> 02:24:03.935
I THINK WHAT YOU WHAT YOU HEARD

02:24:04.002 --> 02:24:04.936
HIM DESCRIBE AND WHAT YOU'VE

02:24:05.003 --> 02:24:06.404
HEARD JC TALK ABOUT IS REALLY

02:24:06.471 --> 02:24:07.572
THE DIRECTION WE'RE WANTING TO

02:24:07.638 --> 02:24:09.974
GO WE UNDERSTAND THE LIMITED.

02:24:10.041 --> 02:24:11.943
INCENTIVE AND AS YOU HEARD I

02:24:12.010 --> 02:24:13.111
THINK OUR PARTNERSHIP --

02:24:13.177 --> 02:24:14.312
PLANNED DISCUSS IT'S NOT THAT

02:24:14.379 --> 02:24:15.947
THERE IS NO INCENTIVE BECAUSE

02:24:16.014 --> 02:24:16.814
THERE'S A TIME LIMITED CHAIN YOU

02:24:16.881 --> 02:24:18.116
KNOW PERIOD.

02:24:18.182 --> 02:24:20.685
BUT HOW DO WE BETTER INCENTIVIZE

02:24:20.752 --> 02:24:22.220
AND WITHOUT AND I THINK AND I

02:24:22.286 --> 02:24:23.354
APPRECIATED THE FOUNDATION OF

02:24:23.421 --> 02:24:25.456
THE WORKGROUPS WORK IN

02:24:25.523 --> 02:24:27.392
RECOGNIZING THAT THE FIRST STEP.

02:24:27.458 --> 02:24:28.626
CAN'T NECESSARILY ALWAYS BE JUST

02:24:28.693 --> 02:24:29.827
PUT MORE MONEY IN THERE AND SO I

02:24:29.894 --> 02:24:31.562
YOU KNOW I THINK THAT WE'RE

02:24:31.629 --> 02:24:32.463
REALLY TRYING TO LOOK AT WHAT

02:24:32.530 --> 02:24:34.032
ARE THE WHAT ARE THE WAYS TO DO

02:24:34.098 --> 02:24:36.000
THIS IN A COST NEUTRAL OR COST

02:24:36.067 --> 02:24:37.035
NEUTRAL OVER YOU KNOW.

02:24:37.101 --> 02:24:38.803
A FAIRLY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME SO

02:24:38.870 --> 02:24:39.837
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT INCREASING

02:24:39.904 --> 02:24:41.139
STATE EXPENDITURES ARE

02:24:41.205 --> 02:24:42.807
NECESSARILY BUT WE WANT TO MAKE

02:24:42.874 --> 02:24:43.374
SURE WE'RE DRIVING THE RIGHT

02:24:43.441 --> 02:24:45.977
INCENTIVES AND SO LOOKING AT AS

02:24:46.044 --> 02:24:46.611
THREE D. C. SAID LOOKING AT HOW

02:24:46.677 --> 02:24:49.147
DO WE SCALE --

02:24:49.213 --> 02:24:50.181
EIGHT AS A PART OF OUR MANAGED

02:24:50.248 --> 02:24:51.682
CARE PLANS BECAUSE AGAIN IF THAT

02:24:51.749 --> 02:24:52.650
IS ARE AT THAT HAS BEEN OUR

02:24:52.717 --> 02:24:53.951
PRIMARY DELIVERY SYSTEM SO HOW

02:24:54.018 --> 02:24:56.054
DO WE RELY ON THEM. TO TO DO

02:24:56.120 --> 02:24:57.488
SOME OF THIS AND HAVE IT BE MORE

02:24:57.555 --> 02:24:58.756
CONSISTENT ACROSS THE STATE.

02:24:58.823 --> 02:25:00.291
ALSO AS YOU SEE MENTION A LOT OF

02:25:00.358 --> 02:25:01.726
THE WHOLE PERSON CARE STAFF WERE

02:25:01.793 --> 02:25:03.027
VERY EXCITED ABOUT.

02:25:03.094 --> 02:25:04.328
OBVIOUSLY WITH THE EXPIRATION OF

02:25:04.395 --> 02:25:05.329
THE WAIVER THAT PARTICULAR

02:25:05.396 --> 02:25:06.731
PROGRAM WILL BE GOING AWAY BUT

02:25:06.798 --> 02:25:08.433
WE ARE REALLY LOOKING AT THE

02:25:08.499 --> 02:25:09.867
SUCCESSES THERE AND HOW DO WE

02:25:09.934 --> 02:25:11.169
BUILD ON THAT INFRASTRUCTURE

02:25:11.235 --> 02:25:12.703
THAT'S ALREADY EXISTS.

02:25:12.770 --> 02:25:14.005
IN OUR COUNTIES AND WITH OUR

02:25:14.072 --> 02:25:15.706
PLANS AS THEIR PARTNERS --

02:25:15.773 --> 02:25:16.607
TODAY AND HAVE THAT BE

02:25:16.674 --> 02:25:18.176
ADMINISTERED THROUGH THE PLAN SO

02:25:18.242 --> 02:25:19.410
THAT WE CAN PROVIDE SOME OF THE

02:25:19.477 --> 02:25:20.812
SERVICES.

02:25:20.878 --> 02:25:22.313
THAT TRADITIONALLY HAVE NOT BEEN

02:25:22.380 --> 02:25:24.582
PAID FOR AND ACCOUNTED FOR AND

02:25:24.649 --> 02:25:26.084
MAKING SURE THAT THEN WE ARE

02:25:26.150 --> 02:25:28.219
SORT OF USING THE FORTIES WE CAN

02:25:28.286 --> 02:25:29.620
TO GET THE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR

02:25:29.687 --> 02:25:31.055
THAT I THINK THAT YOU HAVE THAT

02:25:31.122 --> 02:25:33.124
QUESTION EARLIER OF YOU KNOW.

02:25:33.191 --> 02:25:34.592
WE WE ARE SOMETIMES LIMITED IN

02:25:34.659 --> 02:25:35.660
WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO

02:25:35.726 --> 02:25:37.028
ACCOMPLISH BECAUSE OF FEDERAL

02:25:37.095 --> 02:25:38.362
REQUIREMENTS AROUND HOW WOULD

02:25:38.429 --> 02:25:39.931
YOU RATE SETTING AND AND ALL OF

02:25:39.997 --> 02:25:40.998
THOSE THINGS I THINK WE'RE

02:25:41.065 --> 02:25:43.568
TRYING TO TAKE A BROADER LOOK AT

02:25:43.634 --> 02:25:45.703
AT WHAT ARE THE STORIES THAT ARE

02:25:45.770 --> 02:25:47.004
POSSIBLE AND I THINK.

02:25:47.071 --> 02:25:48.706
AGAIN DEPENDING ON OUR

02:25:48.773 --> 02:25:51.609
FEDERALIST FIFTEEN WEBER I THINK

02:25:51.676 --> 02:25:54.145
IT'S GOING TO HELP US. TO NOT

02:25:54.212 --> 02:25:55.646
HAVE SOME OF THOSE COST --

02:25:55.713 --> 02:25:57.415
COST DRIVEN AT THINGS THAT WE

02:25:57.482 --> 02:25:59.083
HAVE TO DO TODAY --

02:25:59.150 --> 02:26:00.184
AND REALLY LOOKING AT THE

02:26:00.251 --> 02:26:02.186
CONCEPT OF ALLOWING PLANS IN

02:26:02.253 --> 02:26:03.788
REQUIRING PLANS TO PROVIDE THESE

02:26:03.855 --> 02:26:06.724
SORT OF LESS COSTLY SERVICES AND

02:26:06.791 --> 02:26:08.359
THOSE BE RECOGNIZED AS A PART OF

02:26:08.426 --> 02:26:09.727
THEIR RATE DEVELOPMENT AND NOT

02:26:09.794 --> 02:26:10.995
HAVE THIS ISSUE THAT PEOPLE ARE

02:26:11.062 --> 02:26:12.063
SAYING THAT THEY'RE INVESTING

02:26:12.130 --> 02:26:12.997
AND THEN --

02:26:13.064 --> 02:26:14.632
THEIR COSTS GO DOWN AND THAT'S

02:26:14.699 --> 02:26:15.933
NOT REFLECTED IN THEIR IN THEIR

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:17.068
RATES SO THAT CERTAINLY IS

02:26:17.135 --> 02:26:18.369
SOMETHING I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT

02:26:18.436 --> 02:26:21.639
I THINK IT IS I WOULD CAUTION.

02:26:21.706 --> 02:26:22.707
AS I ALWAYS DO WITH CAL STUFF

02:26:22.773 --> 02:26:23.207
IT'S ALWAYS MUCH MORE

02:26:23.274 --> 02:26:25.176
COMPLICATED RATE THAN ANY OF US

02:26:25.243 --> 02:26:27.044
WANT IT TO BE --

02:26:27.111 --> 02:26:28.779
YOU KNOW JC IS LEADING OUR WORK

02:26:28.846 --> 02:26:30.681
IN THIS AREA AND REALLY HAVING A

02:26:30.748 --> 02:26:32.617
TIME FRAME IN A TIME LINE. FOR

02:26:32.683 --> 02:26:33.918
THESE TYPES OF CHANGES THAT WE

02:26:33.985 --> 02:26:35.286
WANT TO MAKE AN MEDI CAL --

02:26:35.353 --> 02:26:36.888
AS SHE KNOWS AND EVERYONE WHO'S

02:26:36.954 --> 02:26:37.722
HEARD ME TALK ABOUT THIS AND

02:26:37.788 --> 02:26:39.490
OTHER PLACES NO YOU KNOW I TALK

02:26:39.557 --> 02:26:41.492
ABOUT IT AS LIKE A FIVE TEN AND

02:26:41.559 --> 02:26:43.427
FIFTEEN YEAR. FOR HER RISE IN IN

02:26:43.494 --> 02:26:45.163
TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO DO YOU

02:26:45.229 --> 02:26:47.765
KNOW TURN A BIG SHIP PEOPLE

02:26:47.832 --> 02:26:49.033
DON'T LIKE WHEN I CALL THE

02:26:49.100 --> 02:26:51.135
TITANIC BECAUSE THERE AND LIKE

02:26:51.202 --> 02:26:52.303
WE'RE NOT THINKING.

02:26:52.370 --> 02:26:53.037
OF YOU KNOW IT JUST IT'S IN MY

02:26:53.104 --> 02:26:54.238
EXPERIENCE HAVING BEEN HERE

02:26:54.305 --> 02:26:55.206
EIGHT YEARSWE KNOW WE'VE SEEN A

02:26:55.273 --> 02:26:56.707
LOT OF POSITIVE CHANGE.

02:26:56.774 --> 02:26:58.442
BUT IT IT IS HARD AND ONE OF THE

02:26:58.509 --> 02:27:00.077
REASONS THAT WE'VE STRUGGLED TO

02:27:00.144 --> 02:27:01.312
DO SOME OF THESE THINGS IS THE

02:27:01.379 --> 02:27:04.048
LACK OF STANDARDIZATION AND THE

02:27:04.115 --> 02:27:08.152
I'D SAY HI COMPLEXITY OF THE

02:27:08.219 --> 02:27:11.022
FUNDING SIDE THINGS OPERATE IN

02:27:11.088 --> 02:27:13.057
CERTAIN WAYS AND SO --

02:27:13.124 --> 02:27:13.958
YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE REALLY

02:27:14.025 --> 02:27:15.459
INTERESTED IN TRYING TO THINK

02:27:15.526 --> 02:27:17.628
ABOUT IF WE WERE.

02:27:17.695 --> 02:27:18.429
NAY IN A SORT OF HOW I FRAMED IT

02:27:18.496 --> 02:27:19.730
TO OUR STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY IF

02:27:19.797 --> 02:27:21.966
WE WERE ALL DECIDING TO CREATE

02:27:22.033 --> 02:27:23.768
THE MEDICAL PROGRAM NEW TODAY.

02:27:23.834 --> 02:27:25.636
WE KNOW IT WOULD LOOK LIKE HOW

02:27:25.703 --> 02:27:27.205
IT LOOKS TODAY RIGHT I MEAN.

02:27:27.271 --> 02:27:28.906
NO ONE WOULD HAVE LIKE SAID THIS

02:27:28.973 --> 02:27:30.274
IS THE MOST RATIONAL WAY.

02:27:30.341 --> 02:27:31.676
TO STRUCTURE THE DELIVERY OF

02:27:31.742 --> 02:27:32.410
THIS CARE --

02:27:32.476 --> 02:27:34.245
SO HOW SHOULD HOW WOULD WE WANT

02:27:34.312 --> 02:27:35.613
TO LOOK AND IS IT POSSIBLE TO

02:27:35.680 --> 02:27:36.847
GET THERE OR WHAT CHANGES WOULD

02:27:36.914 --> 02:27:38.449
WE HAVE TOMAKE TO GET THERE AND

02:27:38.516 --> 02:27:39.750
THAT'S REALLY WHERE I TALK ABOUT

02:27:39.817 --> 02:27:41.485
SORT OF THE FIVE TEN AND FIFTEEN

02:27:41.552 --> 02:27:42.486
YEARS BECAUSE I THINK THAT. FOR

02:27:42.553 --> 02:27:44.388
FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE AND HOW DO WE

02:27:44.455 --> 02:27:46.224
LOOK AT THE ISSUES OF AGAIN

02:27:46.290 --> 02:27:47.425
WHAT'S CARVED INTO MANAGED CARE

02:27:47.491 --> 02:27:48.759
WHO'S OPERATING THE DELIVERY

02:27:48.826 --> 02:27:49.894
SYSTEM.

02:27:49.961 --> 02:27:51.395
THE FUNDING IS OBVIOUSLY ALWAYS

02:27:51.462 --> 02:27:52.897
A CHALLENGE NOT JUST THE FEDERAL

02:27:52.964 --> 02:27:54.265
FUNDING PEACE BUT OBVIOUSLY THE

02:27:54.332 --> 02:27:56.234
STATE FUNDING AS YOU WELL KNOW

02:27:56.300 --> 02:27:57.268
FROM BEING YOU KNOW THE BUDGET

02:27:57.335 --> 02:27:59.136
SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIR WE HAVE A LOT

02:27:59.203 --> 02:28:01.105
OF NON STATE GENERAL FUND FUNDED

02:28:01.172 --> 02:28:04.008
PIECES OF OUR NON FEDERAL SHARE

02:28:04.075 --> 02:28:05.376
WHETHER IT'S YOU FROM OUR COUNTY.

02:28:05.443 --> 02:28:06.777
PARTNERS OR TAXIS ARE ALL THESE

02:28:06.844 --> 02:28:08.813
DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ALL HAVE

02:28:08.879 --> 02:28:10.815
HAD COME WITH VERY SPECIFIC WAYS

02:28:10.881 --> 02:28:11.882
OF THE MONEY BEING SPENT.

02:28:11.949 --> 02:28:13.884
SO IT REALLY DOES TAKE A SORT OF

02:28:13.951 --> 02:28:17.622
ALL HOW IT HOW COULD THIS LOOK

02:28:17.688 --> 02:28:18.322
AND CAN WE GET THERE WITH WHAT

02:28:18.389 --> 02:28:19.557
WE HAVE SO.

02:28:19.624 --> 02:28:21.125
THAT REALLY IS OUR FOCUS OVER

02:28:21.192 --> 02:28:22.660
THE NEXT FEW YEARS IS TO REALLY

02:28:22.727 --> 02:28:25.296
TRY TO GET TO A PLACE WERE IN

02:28:25.363 --> 02:28:25.896
TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE'RE HAVING

02:28:25.963 --> 02:28:27.832
SOME FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT.

02:28:27.898 --> 02:28:29.400
CHANGE IN BOTH THE WAIT WHAT THE

02:28:29.467 --> 02:28:30.935
SERVICES ARE BEING PROVIDED AND

02:28:31.002 --> 02:28:32.803
HOW WE'RE PAYING FOR THEM --

02:28:32.870 --> 02:28:35.573
THAT I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT IT

02:28:35.640 --> 02:28:36.340
DOES IT IS A LITTLE SCARY I

02:28:36.407 --> 02:28:37.408
THINK.

02:28:37.475 --> 02:28:38.476
YOU SEE GET SCARED OUR TEAM GET

02:28:38.542 --> 02:28:40.144
SCARED THAT TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS

02:28:40.211 --> 02:28:41.646
ACTUALLY VERY CLOSE --

02:28:41.712 --> 02:28:44.081
MA BUT I I THINK.

02:28:44.148 --> 02:28:45.616
THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT WE

02:28:45.683 --> 02:28:47.385
HAVE TO DO TO EVEN BE ABLE TO

02:28:47.451 --> 02:28:48.919
HAVE FURTHER CONVERSATION OF

02:28:48.986 --> 02:28:50.221
BETTER INTEGRATION FROM ACROSS

02:28:50.288 --> 02:28:52.023
THE DELIVERY SYSTEMS.

02:28:52.089 --> 02:28:52.823
AND THAT FIRST STEP IS REALLY

02:28:52.890 --> 02:28:53.858
THAT SIMPLIFICATION AND

02:28:53.924 --> 02:28:55.960
STANDARDIZATION SO THAT'S SO

02:28:56.027 --> 02:28:57.094
THAT'S ONE PIECE AND THEN JUST

02:28:57.161 --> 02:28:58.496
IN TERMS OF THE ALIGNMENT WITH

02:28:58.562 --> 02:28:59.964
THE OTHER --

02:29:00.031 --> 02:29:01.999
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM CERTAINLY YOU

02:29:02.066 --> 02:29:02.800
KNOW.

02:29:02.867 --> 02:29:04.235
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THINGS

02:29:04.302 --> 02:29:06.137
MAKE RATIONAL SENSE AND AGAIN I

02:29:06.203 --> 02:29:07.571
THINK FOR YOU AS A PROVIDER

02:29:07.638 --> 02:29:08.973
STRUGGLE TO RATE IF YOU'RE

02:29:09.040 --> 02:29:09.573
DIFFERENT RULES ARE DIFFERENT

02:29:09.640 --> 02:29:10.908
THINGS LIKE THAT ARE DIFFERENT

02:29:10.975 --> 02:29:12.443
QUALITY METRICS --

02:29:12.510 --> 02:29:13.711
SO WE WANT WE WANT TO TRY TO

02:29:13.778 --> 02:29:15.346
HAVE A LIGHT MEANT THERE I THINK.

02:29:15.413 --> 02:29:17.315
THE WE DO HAVE CHALLENGES AS AS

02:29:17.381 --> 02:29:18.549
CHRIS MENTIONED AND OTHERS IN

02:29:18.616 --> 02:29:19.717
TERMS OF BOTH THE UNIQUENESS OF

02:29:19.784 --> 02:29:21.018
MEDI CAL IN TERMS OF THE

02:29:21.085 --> 02:29:22.820
POPULATION WE SERVE SO OBVIOUSLY

02:29:22.887 --> 02:29:24.488
OUR POPULATION IS.

02:29:24.555 --> 02:29:25.289
FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT RATE

02:29:25.356 --> 02:29:26.991
THAN THE I WOULD SAY THE CALPERS

02:29:27.058 --> 02:29:28.526
POPULATION --

02:29:28.592 --> 02:29:31.629
OTHERS I MEAN IT'S IT IS SICKER

02:29:31.696 --> 02:29:33.431
POOR POPULATION THAN THAN MOST

02:29:33.497 --> 02:29:34.865
WE ALSO HAVE THE MEDICAID

02:29:34.932 --> 02:29:35.966
REQUIREMENTS.

02:29:36.033 --> 02:29:37.368
THAT -- THAT

02:29:37.435 --> 02:29:40.071
DO COME WITH STRINGS AND THINGS

02:29:40.137 --> 02:29:40.738
THAT WE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO

02:29:40.805 --> 02:29:41.205
YOU.

02:29:41.272 --> 02:29:43.507
AREA AND SO I THINK WHAT WHAT WE

02:29:43.574 --> 02:29:44.308
ALWAYS.

02:29:44.375 --> 02:29:45.609
WHAT WE WANT TO DO AS PART OF

02:29:45.676 --> 02:29:46.811
THE ALIGNMENT CONVERSATION IS I

02:29:46.877 --> 02:29:48.412
THINK IT'S CHALLENGING FOR US

02:29:48.479 --> 02:29:52.516
AND WHEN IT'S PRESENTED AS MEDI-CAL SHOULD ALLY AND THAT'S NOT

02:29:52.583 --> 02:29:53.884
HOW YOU PRESENT IT BUT IS?

02:29:53.951 --> 02:29:54.652
HOW IT MEDI CAL SHOULD ALIGN

02:29:54.719 --> 02:29:56.387
WITH OTHERS INSTEAD OF HOW DO WE

02:29:56.454 --> 02:29:57.822
ALL A LINE TOGETHER?

02:29:57.888 --> 02:29:59.924
AND SEE NO NOT HAVING ONE PART

02:29:59.990 --> 02:30:00.991
OF THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY

02:30:01.058 --> 02:30:02.259
SYSTEM SORT OF SET HOW THINGS

02:30:02.326 --> 02:30:03.361
SHOULD LOOK AND THEN THE REST OF

02:30:03.427 --> 02:30:04.662
US FOLLOW --

02:30:04.729 --> 02:30:05.529
PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU'RE TALKING

02:30:05.596 --> 02:30:06.697
ABOUT THE MEDICAL DELIVERY

02:30:06.764 --> 02:30:07.732
SYSTEM WHICH IS SUCH A LARGE

02:30:07.798 --> 02:30:09.633
PIECE WE CERTAINLY THINK IT

02:30:09.700 --> 02:30:10.434
WOULD BE.

02:30:10.501 --> 02:30:11.902
IMPORTANT TO HAVE US BE A PART

02:30:11.969 --> 02:30:13.537
OF THE CONVERSATION OF WHAT

02:30:13.604 --> 02:30:14.739
SHOULD THINGS LOOK LIKE AND HOW

02:30:14.805 --> 02:30:16.540
SHOULD WE MEASURE THEM AND SO --

02:30:16.607 --> 02:30:17.708
WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE THAT

02:30:17.775 --> 02:30:19.477
CONVERSATION WE DO WORK WITH ALL

02:30:19.543 --> 02:30:21.178
THE FOLKS THAT YOU HAD UP HERE

02:30:21.245 --> 02:30:21.645
WE HAVE CERTAINLY HAD

02:30:21.712 --> 02:30:22.880
CONVERSATIONS.

02:30:22.947 --> 02:30:24.014
AND WORKED WITH THEM ON IN

02:30:24.081 --> 02:30:25.683
VARIOUS CAPACITIES I THINK IT'S

02:30:25.750 --> 02:30:27.551
JUST YOU KNOW ONE OF THOSE --

02:30:27.618 --> 02:30:28.919
THINGS THAT CAN BE CHALLENGING

02:30:28.986 --> 02:30:30.454
BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE OUR OWN

02:30:30.521 --> 02:30:31.655
THINGS WERE TRYING.

02:30:31.722 --> 02:30:33.324
TO SORT OF RESPONSE TO AND SO

02:30:33.391 --> 02:30:34.725
THEN WE END UP HAVING IN SOME

02:30:34.792 --> 02:30:36.127
CASES SOME DESPERATE THINGS AND

02:30:36.193 --> 02:30:40.131
FOR SOME REASON. FOR SOME

02:30:40.197 --> 02:30:40.731
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE AND I

02:30:40.798 --> 02:30:43.501
AND FOR SOME BECAUSE WE THANKS

02:30:43.567 --> 02:30:43.834
VERY MUCH --

02:30:43.901 --> 02:30:46.137
SO I GUESS MY FIRST QUESTION IS

02:30:46.203 --> 02:30:48.239
ACTUALLY ABOUT DISSIPATION IN

02:30:48.305 --> 02:30:53.177
THE AND CALLING COSTED AUS WIE

02:30:53.244 --> 02:30:54.412
SNOW WAS ASKED BEFORE --

02:30:54.478 --> 02:30:56.614
THERE'S AND I A CERTAINLY HEAR

02:30:56.680 --> 02:30:58.315
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT TWELVE

02:30:58.382 --> 02:30:59.817
YOU KNOW MEDI CAL IS THAT THIS

02:30:59.884 --> 02:31:01.185
IS A BIT DIFFERENT ACTUALLY

02:31:01.252 --> 02:31:02.453
INTERESTING ENOUGH AS YOU POINT

02:31:02.520 --> 02:31:06.323
OUT YES SICKER AND POOR YET WE

02:31:06.390 --> 02:31:06.957
SHOULD BE PAID MORE THAN XIN WE

02:31:07.024 --> 02:31:07.625
FOR THAT.

02:31:07.691 --> 02:31:10.361
I MEAN REALLY.

02:31:10.428 --> 02:31:11.429
IT'S A BEING THE LOWEST FARES

02:31:11.495 --> 02:31:12.530
ACTUALLY THE HIGHEST PAIR

02:31:12.596 --> 02:31:13.564
BECAUSE AFTER ALL THE SECOND

02:31:13.631 --> 02:31:15.499
FLOOR RIGHT SO WE DID TAKES MORE

02:31:15.566 --> 02:31:17.234
RESOURCES RIGHT.

02:31:17.301 --> 02:31:19.003
SIDES POINT THAT OUT.

02:31:19.069 --> 02:31:20.070
SO -- AND I

02:31:20.137 --> 02:31:21.105
KNOW IT'S NOT YOU KNOW THAT

02:31:21.172 --> 02:31:21.806
THAT'S A DECISION BY THE WAY

02:31:21.872 --> 02:31:24.442
MADE COLLECTIVELY INCLUDING

02:31:24.508 --> 02:31:27.344
MYSELF ON THE LEGISLATURE.

02:31:27.411 --> 02:31:27.611
SO -- IT'S

02:31:27.678 --> 02:31:30.981
NOT IT'S NOT A STEP FIGURE OUT

02:31:31.048 --> 02:31:32.850
YOU IT'S FOR ME IN MANY WAYS

02:31:32.917 --> 02:31:33.451
ONLY I HAD THE POWER TO DECIDE

02:31:33.517 --> 02:31:33.951
EVERYTHING.

02:31:34.018 --> 02:31:35.453
BUT HOWEVER I DO THINK IN TERMS

02:31:35.519 --> 02:31:37.021
OF AND AND AND SURE --

02:31:37.087 --> 02:31:38.589
I MEAN THAT THAT --

02:31:38.656 --> 02:31:41.258
PERHAPS THE ON THE AND

02:31:41.325 --> 02:31:43.027
SOMETHING'S DIFFERENT THAT SAME

02:31:43.093 --> 02:31:43.894
TIME --

02:31:43.961 --> 02:31:45.596
HEAVY BE ABLE TO THEN DRAW

02:31:45.663 --> 02:31:47.398
COMPARISONS RIGHT --

02:31:47.465 --> 02:31:49.200
TO CERTAIN DEGREE AND ALSO WAS A

02:31:49.266 --> 02:31:50.634
SAID DEBORAH CAL PATIENTS ARE

02:31:50.701 --> 02:31:52.369
STILL YOU KNOW THEY'RE STILL

02:31:52.436 --> 02:31:54.271
PEOPLE IN HUMAN BEINGS RIGHT

02:31:54.338 --> 02:31:56.073
THEY HAVE SEEN SOMEONE ELSE SO

02:31:56.140 --> 02:31:58.275
THE STRUGGLE MORE WITH SOME OF

02:31:58.342 --> 02:31:59.977
THE WITH WITH HE INCOMES OF THE

02:32:00.044 --> 02:32:00.144
SO.

02:32:00.211 --> 02:32:00.911
DO YOU SEE --

02:32:00.978 --> 02:32:01.812
ACTUALLY --

02:32:01.879 --> 02:32:02.780
HOW WE CAN HAVE --

02:32:02.847 --> 02:32:03.714
THE MEDIC OUR MEDICAL PLANS

02:32:03.781 --> 02:32:06.016
PARTICIPATE IN THE QUALITY INN

02:32:06.083 --> 02:32:07.084
COSTED OUT LIST SERVE THEIR

02:32:07.151 --> 02:32:09.253
THINGS WE CAN TRYTO DO. TO TO

02:32:09.320 --> 02:32:11.088
GET THAT INTO THEIR STORE AND I%

02:32:11.155 --> 02:32:16.227
I I THINK --

02:32:16.293 --> 02:32:19.063
AS AS DR RIGHT WOULD MENTION AMY

02:32:19.129 --> 02:32:19.930
THINK THERE'S NOTHING THAT

02:32:19.997 --> 02:32:20.464
PROHIBITS OUR PLANS FROM

02:32:20.531 --> 02:32:21.732
PARTICIPATING I THINK THE

02:32:21.799 --> 02:32:22.333
CHALLENGE THEY'RE BEING THAT

02:32:22.399 --> 02:32:23.000
OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE NOT THE ENTIRE

02:32:23.067 --> 02:32:24.535
DELIVERY SYSTEM --

02:32:24.602 --> 02:32:26.170
AND SO THERE'S MISSING PIECES I

02:32:26.237 --> 02:32:27.238
THINK FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE

02:32:27.304 --> 02:32:29.740
OBVIOUSLY THE CHALLENGE ALWAYS

02:32:29.807 --> 02:32:31.375
WITH US.

02:32:31.442 --> 02:32:33.444
PROVIDING DATA TO OTHER ENTITIES

02:32:33.511 --> 02:32:34.111
ONE IS OBVIOUSLY WE'RE VERY

02:32:34.178 --> 02:32:36.080
FOCUSED ON USING IT TO DO OUR

02:32:36.146 --> 02:32:38.249
OWN MONITORING AND TRANSPARENCY

02:32:38.315 --> 02:32:39.550
AND ALL THE RESOURCES THAT IT

02:32:39.617 --> 02:32:41.018
TAKES TO DO THAT.

02:32:41.085 --> 02:32:42.987
AND I THINK WHAT WE'RE WE'VE HAD

02:32:43.053 --> 02:32:43.754
CHALLENGES AND I THINK THIS IS

02:32:43.821 --> 02:32:45.489
WHERE WE HOW WE LANDED WHERE WE

02:32:45.556 --> 02:32:46.891
DID WITH PROVIDING SUMMARY

02:32:46.957 --> 02:32:48.659
INFORMATION INSTEAD OF SORT OF

02:32:48.726 --> 02:32:50.394
ACTUAL PATIENT LEVEL DATA.

02:32:50.461 --> 02:32:53.063
IS JUST DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF

02:32:53.130 --> 02:32:54.565
THE WAY THAT OUR STRUCTURE WORKS

02:32:54.632 --> 02:32:56.600
IT ACTUALLY REQUIRES IT'S NOT AS

02:32:56.667 --> 02:32:58.402
IT'S NOT APPLES TO APPLES WITH

02:32:58.469 --> 02:32:59.303
DATA THAT FROM A COMMERCIAL

02:32:59.370 --> 02:33:00.538
HEALTH PLAN RIGHT IT'S NOT.

02:33:00.604 --> 02:33:03.107
THE WAY THAT PAYMENTS ARE MADE-THE WAY THAT BENEFITS ARE

02:33:03.173 --> 02:33:04.508
CONSTRUCTED WHAT BENEFITS ARE

02:33:04.575 --> 02:33:05.376
COVERED.

02:33:05.442 --> 02:33:06.510
AND SO WHEN WE HAVE ALL THESE

02:33:06.577 --> 02:33:09.013
ISSUES OF SOME --

02:33:09.079 --> 02:33:10.180
THAT YOU'RE WELL HERE HOWEVER WE

02:33:10.247 --> 02:33:11.382
HAVE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF THAT

02:33:11.448 --> 02:33:12.750
AND HOW DO YOU.

02:33:12.816 --> 02:33:13.884
HOW DO YOU COUNTER NOT COUNT

02:33:13.951 --> 02:33:16.020
THOSE THINGS IN CERTAIN MEASURES

02:33:16.086 --> 02:33:17.488
LIKE TOTAL COST OF CARE?

02:33:17.555 --> 02:33:19.423
BECOME SUPER COMPLEX AND SO I

02:33:19.490 --> 02:33:21.191
THINK WE STRUGGLE WITH HOW DO WE

02:33:21.258 --> 02:33:23.394
HOW DO WE HOW DO WE JUST HAVE

02:33:23.460 --> 02:33:24.995
DATA IN THERE WHEN IT'S NOT AN

02:33:25.062 --> 02:33:26.630
APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISON AND

02:33:26.697 --> 02:33:27.698
SO WE'VE TRIED TO SORT OF WORK

02:33:27.765 --> 02:33:28.399
AROUND.

02:33:28.465 --> 02:33:30.568
THIS WAY OF PROVIDING BUT MORE

02:33:30.634 --> 02:33:32.202
SUMMARY INFORMATION.

02:33:32.269 --> 02:33:34.371
AND ALSO SHARE OUT ALL THE ALL

02:33:34.438 --> 02:33:35.372
THE REPORTING AND DATA THAT WE

02:33:35.439 --> 02:33:36.273
ARE NOT THE ONLY PLACE THAT

02:33:36.340 --> 02:33:39.276
PROVIDES REPORTING OF QUALITY IN

02:33:39.343 --> 02:33:40.377
CONTRACTOR BY MADE IT I THINK I

02:33:40.444 --> 02:33:42.012
THINK THERE'S ACTUALLY TO LEAD.

02:33:42.079 --> 02:33:43.347
TO I REALIZE MAY NOT BE OBSOLETE

02:33:43.414 --> 02:33:45.549
APPLES APPLES BUT I THINK THAT

02:33:45.616 --> 02:33:47.551
THERE IS AND SO SOMETHING IS A

02:33:47.618 --> 02:33:49.253
MOBILE ASTERIX AND PLACES BUT I

02:33:49.320 --> 02:33:51.288
THINK THAT --

02:33:51.355 --> 02:33:51.722
Và.

02:33:51.789 --> 02:33:53.357
WE HEARD A LOT IN THIS HEARING

02:33:53.424 --> 02:33:56.160
ABOUT NOW ONLY ALIGNMENT BUT IT

02:33:56.226 --> 02:33:57.995
NAY ON TERMS OF BUT ALSO IN

02:33:58.062 --> 02:33:58.996
TERMS OF YOU KNOW TRYING TO

02:33:59.063 --> 02:34:00.998
CREATE --

02:34:01.065 --> 02:34:03.968
BECAUSE IT IS A SITE YOU YOU

02:34:04.034 --> 02:34:05.336
WANT TO I MEAN THERE IS A

02:34:05.402 --> 02:34:07.037
CERTAIN DEGREE ONE CAN ARGUE

02:34:07.104 --> 02:34:09.039
THERE ARE SOME DEAL MEDI CAL

02:34:09.106 --> 02:34:10.774
PROVIDERS ONLY SEE MEDI CAL AND

02:34:10.841 --> 02:34:12.776
SO FORTH AND BUT I THINK AS WE

02:34:12.843 --> 02:34:13.243
THINK ABOUT --

02:34:13.310 --> 02:34:17.114
AND STARS HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN

02:34:17.181 --> 02:34:20.818
OUR STATE ALSO AND AND AND AND

02:34:20.884 --> 02:34:21.485
SOME OF THE OTHER PLANS.

02:34:21.552 --> 02:34:22.987
YET BE ABLE TO HAVE A COMMON

02:34:23.053 --> 02:34:24.088
DATA.

02:34:24.154 --> 02:34:26.023
SOURCE OUT NOT EVERYTHING MAY BE

02:34:26.090 --> 02:34:28.325
EXACTLY THE SAME BUT I THINK

02:34:28.392 --> 02:34:30.094
FIRST OF ALL HELPS US BENCHMARK

02:34:30.160 --> 02:34:32.363
HOW WELL OUR MEDICARE PROGRAMS

02:34:32.429 --> 02:34:33.364
DOING HAVE THIS BENCHMARK OUR

02:34:33.430 --> 02:34:34.632
COMMERCIAL PLANS ARE DOING YOU

02:34:34.698 --> 02:34:35.332
KNOW AND THAT IT WAS A

02:34:35.399 --> 02:34:36.333
COMMERCIAL AND WE'RE TALKING

02:34:36.400 --> 02:34:36.767
ABOUT STATE.

02:34:36.834 --> 02:34:38.535
FINANCED PAID FOR HEALTH CARE

02:34:38.602 --> 02:34:41.071
RIGHT CALPERS COVERED CALIFORNIA

02:34:41.138 --> 02:34:42.172
IT'S ADDRESS SO --

02:34:42.239 --> 02:34:43.874
SO I THINK TRYING TO WORK TOWARD

02:34:43.941 --> 02:34:45.476
BEING ABLE TO HAVE.

02:34:45.542 --> 02:34:47.678
THIS I THINK IT'S GONNA BE VERY

02:34:47.745 --> 02:34:49.446
IMPORTANT AND HELPFUL AS I JUST

02:34:49.513 --> 02:34:50.714
FOR CURIOSITY'S SAKE I MEAN WE

02:34:50.781 --> 02:34:51.615
TALK ABOUT VALUE BASED

02:34:51.682 --> 02:34:53.117
PURCHASING SO IF YOU'RE GOING

02:34:53.183 --> 02:34:55.152
OUT DOING VALUE BASED PURCHASING

02:34:55.219 --> 02:34:56.086
ONE IS YOU CAN LEVERAGE OFF AT

02:34:56.153 --> 02:34:57.554
OTHER MODELS ALSO YOU HAVE A

02:34:57.621 --> 02:34:59.056
SENSE OF WHERE YOU STAND.

02:34:59.123 --> 02:35:01.025
COMPARED TO WEAR AS A PURCHASER

02:35:01.091 --> 02:35:03.227
AS TO WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE

02:35:03.293 --> 02:35:04.862
STANDING OKAY WAIT A MINUTE

02:35:04.928 --> 02:35:06.664
OUTCOME I'M PAYING ABOUT MUCH

02:35:06.730 --> 02:35:09.199
MORE ARE OUT OF MY SYSTEMS WERE

02:35:09.266 --> 02:35:10.434
A YEAH THERE'S THAT WHILE WE'RE

02:35:10.501 --> 02:35:11.602
DOING BETTER THAN THEY ARE THAT

02:35:11.669 --> 02:35:12.970
SO I THINK THERE'S THAT THAT

02:35:13.037 --> 02:35:13.637
IT'S HELPFUL FOR EVERYONE. TO BE

02:35:13.704 --> 02:35:14.238
ABLE TO DO THAT SO WE SHOULD

02:35:14.304 --> 02:35:16.006
HOPEFULLY LOOK AT HOW WE CAN TRY

02:35:16.073 --> 02:35:18.008
TO GET MORE IN THAT DIRECTION IN

02:35:18.075 --> 02:35:18.876
MY MIND.

02:35:18.942 --> 02:35:21.545
AND IT BECAUSE IN THE END IT IS

02:35:21.612 --> 02:35:21.912
GOING TO BE --

02:35:21.979 --> 02:35:24.081
YOU HAVE A PROVIDER LIKE MYSELF

02:35:24.148 --> 02:35:25.649
AND ALL HAVE FAILED WELL

02:35:25.716 --> 02:35:28.118
ACTUALLY LOT OF MEDICAID --

02:35:28.185 --> 02:35:34.358
SOME COMMERCIAL AND OF AYE EVANS

02:35:34.425 --> 02:35:36.493
IS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET YES

02:35:36.560 --> 02:35:37.828
EXACTLY THE SAME BUT ANY AND

02:35:37.895 --> 02:35:43.367
THAT WELL YOUR MEDICATION A DO

02:35:43.434 --> 02:35:44.935
DO THAT RIGHT AS SO.

02:35:45.002 --> 02:35:46.537
AND ACTUALLY MAY IT MAY WAS

02:35:46.603 --> 02:35:48.005
ACTUALLY LOOKING MEDI CAL --

02:35:48.072 --> 02:35:49.940
ACTUALLY WE HAD A PRESENTATION

02:35:50.007 --> 02:35:52.076
ABOUT GMC IN SACRAMENTO AND THAT

02:35:52.142 --> 02:35:52.876
IS WITH INTERESTING THE ALWAYS

02:35:52.943 --> 02:35:53.911
IT EXCEPT FOR KAISER BECAUSE

02:35:53.977 --> 02:35:55.746
KAISER BASICALLY TREATS ALL THE

02:35:55.813 --> 02:35:56.513
PATIENTS THE SAME TO WRITE AND

02:35:56.580 --> 02:35:57.047
SELL.

02:35:57.114 --> 02:35:58.248
THEIR DELIVERY MODELS OF WHETHER

02:35:58.315 --> 02:36:00.284
YOU'RE MEDI CAL ARE YOU BUYING

02:36:00.350 --> 02:36:00.784
FIRST.

02:36:00.851 --> 02:36:01.852
AND THAT'S KIND OF WHAT WE WANNA

02:36:01.919 --> 02:36:02.686
SEE ACROSS THE SYSTEM RIGHT SO

02:36:02.753 --> 02:36:04.088
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHICH

02:36:04.154 --> 02:36:05.789
INSURANCE CARD YOU SHOW UP WITH.

02:36:05.856 --> 02:36:07.624
AND SO HOW CAN WE MOVE CLOSER IN

02:36:07.691 --> 02:36:09.226
THAT DIRECTION --

02:36:09.293 --> 02:36:10.627
THAT -- AND

02:36:10.694 --> 02:36:11.895
AND AND AND AND TRY TO GET TO

02:36:11.962 --> 02:36:13.397
THAT DIRECTION SO I I CERTAINLY

02:36:13.464 --> 02:36:15.466
WOULD URGE AND HOPE THAT --

02:36:15.532 --> 02:36:17.468
AND WITH AND NOW PLANNED ASK HOW

02:36:17.534 --> 02:36:21.138
WE MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION --

02:36:21.205 --> 02:36:23.006
IT THINK THE IN AND ALSO I THINK

02:36:23.073 --> 02:36:24.174
ESPECIALLY WE'RE DOING VALLEY'S

02:36:24.241 --> 02:36:25.709
IS PURCHASING THE PROPERTY SIX

02:36:25.776 --> 02:36:26.744
AT CETERA I THINK BEING ABLE TO

02:36:26.810 --> 02:36:31.548
PARTICIPATE IN THIS LARGER DATA

02:36:31.615 --> 02:36:34.251
THING IS GOING TO HELP.

02:36:34.318 --> 02:36:36.353
DIED AT AT LEAST IN MY MIND --

02:36:36.420 --> 02:36:37.721
DTS TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE AT

02:36:37.788 --> 02:36:38.622
DOING VALUE BASED PURCHASING

02:36:38.689 --> 02:36:40.023
TYPE ARRANGEMENTS AND ESPECIALLY

02:36:40.090 --> 02:36:41.625
TO LEVERAGE OFF OTHER PEOPLE'S

02:36:41.692 --> 02:36:42.025
TO WRITE.

02:36:42.092 --> 02:36:42.659
IS NOT JUST LIKE ALL OF YOUR

02:36:42.726 --> 02:36:43.794
MEDICARE WILL DO THIS BUT LIKE

02:36:43.861 --> 02:36:45.562
MEDI CAL AND AND THIS ALSO

02:36:45.629 --> 02:36:47.498
INCOMING GALLOPING ALL SAID DO

02:36:47.564 --> 02:36:48.665
THIS I MEAN I THINK.

02:36:48.732 --> 02:36:50.501
EVEN THE GOVERNOR IS SAYING LIKE

02:36:50.567 --> 02:36:52.336

02:36:52.402 --> 02:36:54.638
YOU KNOW PHARMACY FIRSTLY WE

02:36:54.705 --> 02:36:57.574
WILL GET INTO ALL THAT BUT BUT

02:36:57.641 --> 02:37:01.512
YEAH THAT THE MAXIMALLY LEVERAGE

02:37:01.578 --> 02:37:03.080
EVEN EVEN FROM THE STATE'S

02:37:03.147 --> 02:37:04.681
PERSPECTIVE AS A PURCHASER IS A

02:37:04.748 --> 02:37:05.282
PAIR.

02:37:05.349 --> 02:37:06.984
ACROSS EVERYTHING INSTEAD OF

02:37:07.050 --> 02:37:10.888
HAVING EVERYTHING AND SILAS SO --

02:37:10.954 --> 02:37:11.855
SO BIG WE CAN WE CAN DO THAT I

02:37:11.922 --> 02:37:15.526
THINK THE OTHER ISSUE YOU KNOW --

02:37:15.592 --> 02:37:16.894
CALIFORNIA'S GOV INITIATION

02:37:16.960 --> 02:37:18.529
MENTIONED DEL D. A LACK OF

02:37:18.595 --> 02:37:21.365
IMPROVEMENT OVER TIME AND I MEAN

02:37:21.431 --> 02:37:22.099
THERE'S PRESSURE SOME MEASURES

02:37:22.166 --> 02:37:23.600
WENT UP AND DOWN --

02:37:23.667 --> 02:37:24.568

02:37:28.238 --> 02:37:29.873
NOW IF WE HAD A SYSTEM WHERE HE

02:37:29.940 --> 02:37:31.208
SAID WE'RE GOING TO EXPECT

02:37:31.275 --> 02:37:32.276
IMPROVING TRADE AND HAVE PAYMENT

02:37:32.342 --> 02:37:33.377
EVERY YEAR WE'RE NOT HITTING

THAT SO.

02:37:34.411 --> 02:37:35.679
I I HOPE THAT --

02:37:35.746 --> 02:37:36.914

02:38:09.446 --> 02:38:11.181
BETTER THAN IT WOULD AND IT'S

02:38:11.248 --> 02:38:11.682
TEN YES.

02:38:11.748 --> 02:38:13.083
OKAY AND THEN I THINK THE

ROLE WAS WITH THIS WAR BUT WE WE

02:38:19.990 --> 02:38:21.525
REALLY DO NEED TO LOOK AT THAT

02:38:21.592 --> 02:38:23.327
AND AND I'M WAITING KNOWLEDGE.

02:38:23.393 --> 02:38:24.761
YEAH HAVE A KNOWLEDGE THAT --

02:38:24.828 --> 02:38:25.395
YOU KNOW THAT YES THERE'S A BIT

02:38:25.462 --> 02:38:26.597
OF A LAG BETWEEN WE TALKED ABOUT

02:38:26.663 --> 02:38:27.865
IT -- AND

02:38:27.931 --> 02:38:28.799
AND BUT THAT LAG ISN'T VERY LONG

02:38:28.866 --> 02:38:29.967
AND SO IT REALLY ISN'T A

02:38:30.033 --> 02:38:32.803
POSITIVE SENATE FOR PEOPLE WHO

02:38:32.870 --> 02:38:36.506
HAVE TO DO ANYTHING.

02:38:36.573 --> 02:38:37.307
YOU KNOW THEY HAD A BETTER RATE

02:38:37.374 --> 02:38:38.508
SO THAT THAT JUST DOESN'T SOUND

02:38:38.575 --> 02:38:39.643
RIGHT MESSAGE SO.

02:38:39.710 --> 02:38:40.944
AND I REALIZE THERE'S A CMS

02:38:41.011 --> 02:38:42.646
COMPONENT BUT WE'VE GOT TO

02:38:42.713 --> 02:38:44.548

02:38:45.682 --> 02:38:46.850
THAT MAYBE WILL BE LOOKING TO BE

02:38:46.917 --> 02:38:50.120
A DIFFERENT MINISTRATIONS

02:38:50.187 --> 02:38:52.055
ATTITUDE BY THE END.

02:38:52.122 --> 02:38:52.990
I JUST PUT IT THAT WAY --

02:38:53.056 --> 02:38:54.658
SO -- SO I

02:38:54.725 --> 02:38:55.492
APPRECIATE THE THE WORK THE DO I

02:38:55.559 --> 02:38:56.560
AM LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING

02:38:56.627 --> 02:38:57.828
ABOUT IT BOTH IN --

02:38:57.895 --> 02:38:59.196
THE HEALTH COMMITTEE BUT ALSO IN

02:38:59.263 --> 02:39:01.865
THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE AS WELL --

02:39:01.932 --> 02:39:02.900
I THINK WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT

02:39:02.966 --> 02:39:04.234
AFTER SOME RESOURCES WE MIGHT

02:39:04.301 --> 02:39:06.103
NEED TO PUT AND TO MOVE THINGS

02:39:06.169 --> 02:39:07.638
ALONG BUT IT'S AT THE A IT IS

02:39:07.704 --> 02:39:09.206
REALLY ABOUT.

02:39:09.273 --> 02:39:11.208
CULTURE CHANGE SYSTEM CHANGE AND

02:39:11.275 --> 02:39:11.475
THEN -- I

02:39:11.541 --> 02:39:13.010
MEAN IF IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT

02:39:13.076 --> 02:39:14.344
WE THINK ABOUT METRICS AS WELL

02:39:14.411 --> 02:39:16.513
SO THAT'S I MEAN THAT'S THE ONLY

02:39:16.580 --> 02:39:17.247
THING ALIGNMENT OF MODELS

02:39:17.314 --> 02:39:19.216
ALIGNMENT METRICS BECAUSE THAT

02:39:19.283 --> 02:39:22.286
WAY WE CAN COMPARE THINGS RIGHT --

02:39:22.352 --> 02:39:23.754
SO I THINK THE I THINK THAT

02:39:23.820 --> 02:39:24.888
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

02:39:24.955 --> 02:39:26.857
I MEAN AGAIN I I THINK WERE VERY

02:39:26.924 --> 02:39:28.158
MUCH ON THE SAME PAGE WITH SORT

02:39:28.225 --> 02:39:29.893
OF THE DIRECTION THAT YOU'RE

02:39:29.960 --> 02:39:30.794
TALKING ABOUT AND AGAIN I THINK

02:39:30.861 --> 02:39:32.062
THAT WE HEARD OUR PARTNERS TALK

02:39:32.129 --> 02:39:33.864
ABOUT THAT REALLY IS.

02:39:33.931 --> 02:39:36.333
WHERE WE WANT TO GO I YOU KNOW I

02:39:36.400 --> 02:39:41.204
THINK IT'S TIME FRAME --

02:39:41.271 --> 02:39:41.838
AND IT'S NEVER GONNA BE AS FAST

02:39:41.905 --> 02:39:43.807
AS THE ALL WHAT.

02:39:43.874 --> 02:39:45.008
I I'VE BEEN LATELY POINT THIS

02:39:45.075 --> 02:39:47.511
OUT THOUGH I MEAN I THINK THAT --

02:39:47.577 --> 02:39:48.679
AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT MEDI CAL

02:39:48.745 --> 02:39:50.447
AND WITH THIS HEARING WAS ABOUT

02:39:50.514 --> 02:39:52.549
NEXT AMERICA ALONE.

02:39:52.616 --> 02:39:55.552
IS THE THERE'S A REASON HEALTH

02:39:55.619 --> 02:39:56.687
CARE WAS REALLY THE TOP OF THE

02:39:56.753 --> 02:39:58.255
AGENDA IN THIS LAST ELECTION AND

02:39:58.322 --> 02:39:58.989
WHEN --

02:39:59.056 --> 02:39:59.556
AFTER EVEN AFTER GOVERNOR

02:39:59.623 --> 02:40:01.658
NEWSOME WAS ELECTED --

02:40:01.725 --> 02:40:03.260
WHEN THE TV I SEE DID A POLL OF

02:40:03.327 --> 02:40:05.729
ALL THE PROMISES HE MADE?

02:40:05.796 --> 02:40:08.131
THE TOP ON THE PUBLIC SAID THEY

02:40:08.198 --> 02:40:09.166
WANT TO DEAL WITH HEALTHCARE

02:40:09.232 --> 02:40:11.501
RATE -- WE

02:40:11.568 --> 02:40:12.602

WELCOME I A GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR

02:46:57.540 --> 02:46:57.807
PAN -- SHOCK

02:46:57.874 --> 02:46:58.641
OF IT I WITH THE SERVICE

02:46:58.708 --> 02:46:59.943
EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION

02:47:00.009 --> 02:47:02.846
AND THE CERTAINLY IS A VERY --

02:47:02.912 --> 02:47:04.214
ROBUST TOPIC --

02:47:04.280 --> 02:47:05.715
I WOULD JUST SAY THAT --

02:47:05.782 --> 02:47:07.250
WE BELIEVE THAT ANY CONVERSATION

02:47:07.317 --> 02:47:10.587
ON CAL SHOULD BE CENTERED AROUND

02:47:10.653 --> 02:47:12.288
THE MEDI CAL POPULATION BECAUSE

02:47:12.355 --> 02:47:14.858
OF THE DEMOGRAPHIC DIFFERENCES.

02:47:14.924 --> 02:47:16.993
AND I THINK HAVING A SORT OF A

02:47:17.060 --> 02:47:18.361
MORE STATEWIDE --

02:47:18.428 --> 02:47:20.230
QUALITY PLAN AND FOCUS THAT

02:47:20.296 --> 02:47:22.432
LOOKS AT A COMMUNITIES OF COLOR

02:47:22.499 --> 02:47:25.034
IN PARTICULAR IS IT IS IMPORTANT

02:47:25.101 --> 02:47:27.170
AND WE NEED TO MOVE DH CS AT

02:47:27.237 --> 02:47:29.239
MORE IN THAT DIRECTION --

02:47:29.305 --> 02:47:31.074
BUT EVEN STILL IT'S BECAUSE THE

02:47:31.141 --> 02:47:32.542
PROGRAM IS SICKER POORER AND

02:47:32.609 --> 02:47:33.476
BROWN -- SO

02:47:33.543 --> 02:47:34.878
EVEN STILL --

02:47:34.944 --> 02:47:35.745
THERE ARE GOING TO BE

02:47:35.812 --> 02:47:38.815
DIFFERENCES AMONG REGIONS AND SO

02:47:38.882 --> 02:47:39.482
FOR EXAMPLE I KNOW YOU'RE

02:47:39.549 --> 02:47:40.717
INTERESTED IN THE OPIOID

02:47:40.784 --> 02:47:42.886
EPIDEMIC CERTAINLY IN NORTHERN

02:47:42.952 --> 02:47:44.254
CALIFORNIA IN OUR MEDICAID

02:47:44.320 --> 02:47:45.455
POPULATION THAT'S GOING TO BE A

02:47:45.522 --> 02:47:46.456
HUGE DEAL.

02:47:46.523 --> 02:47:48.191
BUT IN OTHER REGIONS WE'RE GONNA

02:47:48.258 --> 02:47:50.794
NEED TO FOCUS MORE ON ISSUES

02:47:50.860 --> 02:47:51.995
LIKE ASTHMA OR DIABETES OR

02:47:52.061 --> 02:47:54.197
HYPERTENSION AND SO JUST REALLY

02:47:54.264 --> 02:47:55.999
REFINING THE MEDIC HOW QUALITY

02:47:56.065 --> 02:47:57.634
STRATEGY TO BE ABOUT THE MEDI

02:47:57.700 --> 02:47:59.235
CAL POPULATIONS NEEDS.

02:47:59.302 --> 02:48:00.703
AND GETTING PROVIDERS TO THAT

02:48:00.770 --> 02:48:02.038
PLACE WOULD BE A GREAT STARTING

02:48:02.105 --> 02:48:04.040
POINT AND THEN YOU CAN EXPAND

02:48:04.107 --> 02:48:05.575
OUT FROM THERE THINK ON THE

02:48:05.642 --> 02:48:06.509
COMMERCIAL SIDE THERE WAS SOME

02:48:06.576 --> 02:48:07.844
STUFF TALKED ABOUT EARLIER IN

02:48:07.911 --> 02:48:09.779
TERMS OF THE YOU KNOW VALUE OF

02:48:09.846 --> 02:48:11.181
INTEGRATED MODELS THOSE SORTS OF

02:48:11.247 --> 02:48:12.215
THINGS AND I WOULD JUST NOTE.

02:48:12.282 --> 02:48:13.049

NUMBERS OR WHATEVER AND SO I

02:48:23.793 --> 02:48:25.161
THINK IT'S JUST IMPORTANT TO

02:48:25.228 --> 02:48:26.596
KEEP IN MIND THAT WE NEED

02:48:26.663 --> 02:48:27.931
EFFORTS THAT.

02:48:27.997 --> 02:48:29.933
ALSO PASS SOME OF THOSE SAVINGS

02:48:29.999 --> 02:48:32.235
AND SOME OF THAT VALUE ALONG TO

02:48:32.302 --> 02:48:33.536
THE WORKERS WERE PAYING FOR

02:48:33.603 --> 02:48:35.638
PREMIUMS AND CO PAYS AND DON'T

02:48:35.705 --> 02:48:37.006
