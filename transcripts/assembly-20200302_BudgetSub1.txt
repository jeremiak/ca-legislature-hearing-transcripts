GET EVERYONE'S SINCE WE IMPORT THIS NEW. FOR OUR SOMEONE MAYBE TODAY WE ARE STARTING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND I'D LIKE TO WELCOME THEIR NEW DIRECTOR DOCTOR ON HEALTH. OKAY GOOD AFTERNOON IS THE CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M DOCTOR SONYA ANGEL I'M DIRECTOR AND STATE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE TODAY TO PRESENT ON THE STATE OF THE SOUTH IN CALIFORNIA AND- AN UPDATE ON NOVEL CORONAVIRUS. CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH MISSION. WE AT THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE PEOPLE AND COMMUNITES AND WHEN WE SPEAK ABOUT HEALTH IS NOT JUST THE ABSENCE OF DISEASE OR INJURY AS A WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION DEFINES IT HEALTH IS ALSO AN OVERALL STATE OF PHYSICAL. MAY AND SOCIAL WELL BEING. AS SUCH DETAINMENT POPULATIONS OPTIMAL HEALTH IS AN ACHIEVEMENT THAT ESTABLISHES A SOCIETY'S CAPACITY FOR X. EXCESS. INDEED GOOD HEALTH IS THE PRODUCT OF MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITIES AND HEALTH ITSELF CREATES OPPORTUNITIES HEALTH IS A CORNERSTONE FOR SUCCESS AT SCHOOL WORK HOME AND FOR LIFE IN GENERAL. BUT BEFORE I LAUNCH INTO THE OVERALL HEALTH OF OUR STATE LET ME FIRST ADDRESS THE ISSUE THAT I KNOW HAS BEEN IN THE FRONT FOREFRONT OF MANY OF OUR MINDS OF LATE AND AT THE FOREFRONT OF OUR ACTIVITIES HERE AT THE STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT. NOVEL CORONAVIRUS ALSO CALLED CODE NINETEEN. TO START SOME BACKGROUND IN NUMBERS. IN CALIFORNIA TODAY THERE HAVE BEEN A TOTAL OF FORTY THREE CONFIRMED POSITIVE CASES. TWENTY FOUR WERE FIRM REPATRIATION FLIGHTS. THESE WERE FLIGHTS IN OPERATIONS ORGANIZED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BRINGING HOME FELLOW AMERICANS FROM CHINA WHERE THE OUTBREAK FIRST DEVELOPED AND TOOK AN EARLY STRONGHOLD. THE OTHER NINETEEN CONFIRMED CASES IN NON REPATRIATED PEOPLE INCLUDE TEN THAT ARE TRAVEL RELATED AND FOUR CASES OF COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION IN INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD NO KNOWN SOURCE OF EXPOSURE. FIVE CASES WERE FROM PERSON TO PERSON SPREAD FOR HIM THE SOURCES OF EXPOSURE OR NOW. WE'RE TAKING ACTION TOGETHER WITH LOCAL OFFICIALS THERE BEEN TEAMS IN THE FIELD DOING CONTACT TRACING WE'RE IDENTIFYING PEOPLE WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPOSED IN THESE POSITIVE TO THESE POSITIVE CASES ISOLATING THOSE WHO HAVE HIGHER RISK FOR DEVELOPING DISEASE AND TESTING THOSE WITH SYMPTOMS. CALIFORNIA STATE AND LOCAL HEALTH OFFICIALS ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN ENSURING OUR RESIDENTS ACROSS THE STATE REMAIN SAFE AND PROTECTED. WE WERE PREPARED FOR THESE CASES AND WHILE THEY WERE CERTAINLY NOT WELCOMED THEY WERE NOT UNEXPECTED. AND WE'VE BEEN PLANNING FOR THE POTENTIAL FOR GLOBAL SPREAD OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE FOR OVER A DECADE OUR EMERGENCY PLANS HAVE BEEN CONTINUOUSLY UPDATED AND REFINED BASES UPON BASED UPON LESSONS LEARNED EXAMPLE FOR H. ONE AND ONE IN A BOWL OF VIRUS. IN THIS OUTBREAK WERE CONTINUOUSLY UPDATING OUR APPROACH AS WE LEARN MORE ABOUT THE VIRUS AND TRACK IT SPREAD. WE'RE EXPANDING OUR TESTING ACTIVITIES INCREASING OUR STATE'S LABORATORY CAPACITY PLANNING FOR INCREASED DEMANDS ON OUR MEDICAL SYSTEM AND USING THE LATEST HEALTH TO MODEL AND FORECAST THE NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITY. WELL WE'RE REASSESSING THE SITUATION DALY I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE RISK TO THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIA'S GENERAL POPULATION FOR KOBE NINETEEN REMAINS LOW. IF OUR RISK ASSESSMENT CHANGES WILL MAKE YOU AWARE IMMEDIATELY. IT'S NATURAL TO BE CONCERNED AT A TIME LIKE THIS THIS IS A NEW VIRUS BUT WE'RE LEARNING MORE EVERYDAY AND USING THAT EVIDENCE TO INFORM ACTION. THERE'S LOTS OF GOOD INFORMATION OUT THERE BUT THERE'S ALSO SOME INFORMATION THAT ISN'T QUITE RIGHT AND BACK TO FEAR AND STIGMA. I KNOW THAT ALL OF YOU IN POSITIONS AS LEGISLATORS A TRUSTED MEMBER IN YOUR COMMUNITY ARE RECEIVING QUESTIONS. TO SUPPORT YOUR NEEDS FOR RAPID INFORMATION WE'VE BEEN PLEASED TO HOST. REGULAR CALLS FOR YOU AND YOUR STAFF. SEES ME AND WE ARE FREQUENTLY UPDATING OUR WEBSITE AT C. P. H. DOT CA DOT GOV OUR WEBSITE AS WELL AS YOUR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND THE CDC'S ARE EXCELLENT RESOURCES TO HELP DISPEL MISINFORMATION THAT MAY BE CIRCULATING AND TO HELP KEEP YOU UP TO DATE ON THE LATEST INFORMATION. HOW HOW CHEN THANK YOU. EVERY SAID SURE. THANK YOU. OKAY SO WHILE INFECTIOUS DISEASE IS IN THE FOREFRONT OF OUR MINDS. HISTORY SHOWS THAT AS US- THAN IN OUR STATE AND AROUND THE WORLD SOME OF THEM THE OUR GREATEST PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRESS HAS ACTUALLY BEEN MADE IN THIS ARENA IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY FOUR THE LEGENDARY JOHN SNOW TRACE THE DEADLY KURALT. A CHOLERA OUTBREAK PUMP IN LONDON AND SHUTTING IT OFF STOP THE OUTBREAK IN ITS TRACKS. CONSIDER THE FOUNDER OF MODERN DAY EPIDEMIOLOGY HIS UPSTREAM APPROACH TO PROTECTING COMMUNITIES GUIDED BY AN UNDERSTANDING OF PRESENCE OF A DISEASE OR HEALTH IN A POPULATION IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR MODERN DAY PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH. INTERSTATE ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO COMMUNICABLE DISEASES WERE A LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH. OVER THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS SCIENCE AND PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION IS CONTRIBUTED TO PRODUCING BUT OVER HALF THE OVERALL RATE OF DEATHS FOR ALL GROUP. LIFE EXPECTANCY IN IS BUT IT'S A HIGH PULL IT'S EVER BEEN SEVEN NINE POINT FIVE BERMAN AND EIGHTY FOUR POINT FOUR FOR WOMEN. INFECTIOUS DISEASES NO LONGER TAKE THE MOST LIVES CHRONIC CONDITIONS INSTEAD DO RESPONSIBLE FOR NINE OF TEN DEATHS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. STILL THERE HAVE BEEN MAJOR ADVANCES IN ADDRESSING THE LEADING CAUSES OF EARLY DEATH BOTH RATES OF ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE AND LUNG CANCER HAVE DECREASED STEADILY AND SUBSTANTIALLY OVER RECENT YEARS. ADDRESSING HEALTH AND THESE IS NOT ONLY CENTRAL TO APPROVING POPULATION HEALTH IT'S ESSENTIAL. GOOD HEALTH IS NOT EXPERIENCE EVENLY ACROSS OUR STATE SOME POPULATIONS CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGH RATES OF EARLY DEATH DUE TO PREVENTABLE CONDITIONS. ANY DISPARITIES OR DIFFERENCES IN. OUTCOMES EXIST BETWEEN POPULATION GROUPS IN CALIFORNIA AND WHEN THOSE DIFFERENCES ARE DUE TO STRUCTURAL OR SYSTEMIC DIFFERENCE THAT. DIFFERENCES THAT UNJUSTLY AFFECT SELECT POPULATIONS THERE CALLED HEALTH INEQUITIES. RACE ETHNICITY COUNTRY OF ORIGIN SEX GENDER SEXUAL ORIENTATION AGE GEOGRAPHY ARE ALL EXAMPLES OF CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH INEQUITIES. FOR EXAMPLE MANY HEALTH CONDITIONS A CURRENT HIGHER FRQUENCY AND EARLIER AND WITH GREATER SEVERITY AMONG POPULATIONS OF COLOR AND THOSE EXPERIENCING DOES YOUR ECONOMICS. LOWER SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS. AND THE CONDITIONS THAT PRODUCE THESE CONDITIONS DIFFERENCES ARE STE SOCIAL STRUCTURED THEY'RE CALLED SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. PRETTY AND RACISM ARE TWO OF THOSE CONDITIONS. ONE STRIKING EXAMPLE IS WHEN COMPARING THE HEALTH OUTCOMES AMONG BLACK AND WHITE POPULATIONS IN CALIFORNIA. THE AGE ADJUSTED ALL CAUSE DEATH RATIO IS 30% HIGHER FOR BLACKS THAN WHITES THESE DIFFERENCES. BECOME EVEN PRINT IN U. STAGES. DE. RATES FOR TWO AGES FIVE TO FOR ARE TIME HIRAM BLACK THAN WHITES AND FOR CHILDREN A ZERO TO FOUR THERE TO POINTS TO TIMES HOW. THE GOOD NEWS THAT FROM OF THE LEADING CAUSE OF IN THIS. WE KNOW WHAT TO DO. WE KNOW WE CAN PREVENT MOST LONG CANCERS BY STOPPING SMOKING WE KNOW WE CAN PREVENT EARLY HEART ATTACKS AND STROKES BY CONTROLLING BLOOD PRESSURE AND LOWERING CHOLESTEROL. AND WE KNOW WHAT THE INTERVENTIONS ARE NEEDED TO DO THAT. AND IF WE DO THIS WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO HEALTH INEQUITIES WE CAN CLOSE THOSE GAPS AND OUTCOMES. WHILE MOST OF OUR REPORTED DATA CONSIDERS HEALTH BY EXAMINING ILLNESS IN A POPULATION OUR COMMUNITIES ALSO HAVE GREAT ASSETS AND STRENGTH AND RESILIENCE ALL OF THESE CAN BE INVESTED IN. SUPPORTED AND BUILD UP. THE COMMUNITIES CAN LEAD CREATING HEALTH THROUGH SOLUTIONS THEY KNOW. WILL HELP THE PART SINCE OUR FOR. INACTION ONE OF PUBLIC HEALTH MOST UNIQUE IN THE SENSE ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS IS POPULATION SURVEILLANCE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH USES OUR TECHNICAL EXPERTISE AND DATA ANALYSIS LABORATORY TESTING AND SCIENTIFIC PRACTICE TO IDENTIFY THE MONITOR HEALTH ISSUES THAT OF THE ISSUES THAT AFFECT HEALTH PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTITIONER EXPERTS AT IDENTIFYING BUT AN UNDERSTANDING ROUTE BECAUSE THE AND UNDERSTANDING SECTIONS ACROSS ILLNESS ISSUES. PUBLIC HELP ALSO CONDUCTS COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF COMMUNITY AND POLICY LANDSCAPE TO LOOK AHEAD TO THE NEEDS OF POPULATIONS IN AN INTENSELY CHANGING ENVIRONMENT WE IDENTIFY POTENTIAL UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES USING A HEALTH EQUITY LINE WORRY OUR FOREIGN DATA COMMUNITY EVENTS EVALUATION. THE PUBLIC HEALTH DIDN'T DEVELOP AND PURSUE PREVENTION STRATEGIES AND TO WORK WITH OUR MANY PARTNERS TO PROTECT AND IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF ALL PEOPLE. HEALTH IS THE PRODUCT OF ONE'S CUMULATIVE EXPERIENCE ACROSS THE LIFESPAN ONE IMPORTANT INTERSECTION IS PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH. IN THE END IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT LIVING LONGER BUT LIVING WELL. HEALTH AND WELL BEING ARE. SHAPE BY COMMUNITY. PLACE MATTERS I OFTEN HEAR PEOPLE TALK ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO MAKE HEALTHY CHOICES. BUT YOU CAN'T EAT HEALTHY CHOICES IF YOU DON'T HAVE HEALTHY CHOICES. AS A PHYSICIAN I KNOW THAT WHILE I CAN TELL MY PATIENTS TO EAT MORE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IN MANY NEIGHBORHOODS. NOT BE GROCERY STORES BY. VEGETABLE ARE EXPENSE. FOR THOSE ON A LIMITED BUDGET THE CHOICE OF EATING MORE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES MIGHT MEAN NOT AND MEDICATIONS. SO WHICH IS THE HEALTHIEST CHOICE. BY SIMPLY MAPPING WE KNOW THE SOCIO ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AND COMMUNITY ASSETS BOTH INFLUENCE HEALTH CHOICE. HEALTH OUTCOMES. AND THE VERY BY GEOGRAPHY AND INTERACT IN COMPLICATED WAYS. TEAMING UP PUBLIC HEALTH AND MEDICAL SYSTEM RESOURCES CAN BE SYNERGISTIC WAYS TO MAKE OUR ASSETS GO FURTHER MANY KEY IMPROVEMENTS IN POPULATION HEALTH OF BEEN ACHIEVED THIS WAY DECREASES IN HEART DISEASE AND LUNG CANCER AS WELL AS OTHER NOT WORTH THE REDUCTIONS IN. ANY CONDITION CONTACT STRUCK THE PUBLIC DISEASE HEPATITIS C. HEPATITIS B. AND H. I. V. HAVE ALL THE FLUID BY PUBLIC HEALTH AND CLINICAL ITEMS WORKING TOGETHER. UNLESS PROCESS I'VE SPENT A- DE IN YOUNGER PEOPLE ARE. BY HIGHLY. INJURY RELATED CONDITIONS INCLUDING DRUG ASSOCIATES TO DEATH ROAD INJURIES SUICIDE AND HOMICIDE. YES IN THE AGING POPULATION ARE DOMINATED BY CHRONIC DISEASES INCLUDING CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND CANCER. THERE IS MUCH WE CAN DO TO SUPPORT HEALTHY AGING NOW AND EVERYONE BUT OUR BEST OPPORTUNITY TO ASSURE HEALTHY AGING IS START WHEN PEOPLE ARE YOUNG. THE IMPACT OF CHILDHOOD AND UNITY ADVERSITY TOXIC STRESSING CUMULATIVE TRAUMA IS A ROOT CAUSE OF SOME OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT HEALTH CHALLENGES FACING CALIFORNIA. ADVERSE CHILDHOOD THE GOOD EXPERIENCES ACES CAN HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON PEOPLE'S LIVES THROUGH THE THROUGHOUT ADULTHOOD AND LEAVE PEOPLE MORE VULNERABLE TO ENVIRONMENTS AND BEHAVIORS THAT CAN LOOT LATER FOR HEALTH. IN CAL FOR SIX THREE. PERCENT OF. ADULT ZING ONE. IN CALIFORNIA WE WILL CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN CORE PUBLIC HEALTH CAPACITY THIS INCLUDES CONTINUE TO WORK TO ADDRESS LEADING RISK FACTORS ANIBAL DEATHS LIKE TOBACCO AND HYPERTENSION STOPPING VAPING IN HOUSTON RE IN TEXAS DISEASE CONTROL THROUGH VACCINATION EDUCATION OUTREACH WILL BE ESSENTIAL WE WILL USE OUR WITH THE BALL WE WILL ALSO MAINTAIN EDEMA IMMOBILIZING. WOULD HELP IS USED CORRUPTS TO Y. FIRST LOOK SEVERAL DO CHALLENGING CAL WERE HEALTH STAND ASIDE BECAUSE WE HAVE USE BY SO TO LOSE DOING. CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT I LOOK FORWARD TO JOIN YOU IN THE FUTURE TO DISCUSS THE DETAILS OF THESE DEVELOPING PLANS. FOR ALL THESE AREAS AND MORE WILL BE EXPLORING WAYS TO STRENGTHEN OUR SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS TO ENSURE THEY ARE NOT LEAVING ANYONE BEHIND BECAUSE WHILE WE MEASURE WHAT MATTERS WHAT WE DON'T MEASURE ALSO MATTERS THERE ARE KEY POPULATIONS WHICH OUR CURRENT STANDARD POPULOUS. IS DO NOT CAPTION I'LL- AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE ARE NOW KEEP. SOME BECAUSE THE SURVEYS THEMSELVES AREN'T DESIGNED IN A WAY THAT WOULD ENGAGE IN FULLY THE UNDOCUMENTED RURAL COMMUNITIES LGBT Q. PERSONS JUSTICE INVOLVED POPULATIONS AND PEOPLE EXT. HOMELESSNESS JUST A FEW OF THE EXAMPLE. WELL WE'RE TAKING STEPS TO ADDRESS THOSE GAPS IMPROVING OUR DATASETS SYSTEMS WILL REFLECT ALL POPULATIONS TO REFLECT ALL POPULATIONS IS A PRIORITY WITHOUT THAT UNDERSTANDING THE DESIGN AND REFINEMENT OF OUR INTERVENTIONS TO SEMIS. THE FULLY REAR. TODAY THROUGH MY FIRST. HELP AT LARGE I PROVIDED A BROAD OVERVIEW OF WHAT OUR DATA IS TELLING US WE'RE LIVING LONGER AND MAKING GREAT PROGRESS STILL UNACCEPTABLE AND I'M JUST INEQUITIES EXIST PROMISING IS THAT FROM WEST OF THE CAR POOR HEALTH EARLY DEATH WE KNOW WHAT TO. SOLUTION EXIST OUR BUSINESS AND ONCE. BILLET TO IDENTIFY PROBLEMS UNDERSTAND WHICH POPULATIONS ARE MORE DEFECTIONS AFFECTED AND MEASURE PROGRESS IN IMPLEMENTATION. I LOOK FORWARD TO DISCUSSING SPECIFIC PROGRAMS IN THE FUTURE AND- THE REST THIS HEARING WILL BE FOCUSED ON FUNDING SOME OF THOSE INTERVENTIONS WHICH CAN SHE TRAJECTORY OF THE STATE'S HEALTH. CLOSE BEG KNOWLEDGE WHILE WEEK. THE STAND AND DESCRIBED AS YOU CAN HELP IN AGGREGATE EVERY DATAPOINT REPS THAT REPRESENTS THE PERSON A MOTHER A FATHER A CHILD A PARENT A NEIGHBOR MAYBE EVEN WHAT HAVE YOU.

SEE IF THE SUBCOMMITTEE HAS ANY QUESTIONS- SOME WELL THEN WE WILL START WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS. WE'LL JUST GO DOWN THE LIST. IT'S AN DOCTOR ANGEL CRACK. THAT'S PERFECT FOR THE POSITION SO MOST OF THESE- DEALING WITH THE CORONA VIRUS AND WHAT'S GOING ON- DO WE HAVE. CURRENT NUMBERS ON ABOUT WHAT IS BEING SPENT BY YOUR DEPARTMENT- AND PET PREPARATIONS FOR A PANDEMIC. THOSE ARE NUMBERS THAT WE CAN GET AND PROVIDE FOR YOU I DON'T HAVE THE WE ARE TRACKING THAT YUCCA- QUESTION TO- GOVERNOR'S. OR SNICKERS ADMINISTRATION AND SPENT MONEY ON PREPARATIONS FOR ADDRESSING- POTENTIAL EPIDEMICS STOCKPILING- MASS PROTECTIVE GEAR MEDICINES EXCEPT RUSSIA. ARE WE TRACKING THAT- ALONG WITH THE TO FIELD HOSPITALS THAT THEY PUT IN PLACE AND IS THERE BORN NEEDED. SO I CAN TELL YOU WHAT WE'RE TRACKING OKAY WE AGAIN IT'S BEEN SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN WHEN WE PURCHASED MANY OF THOSE AND I WAS ACTUALLY PART OF THE PURCHASE. MOST OF THE THINGS BACK AND I'M- DEPUTY OF OUR POLICY AND PROGRAMS. I'M WE DO HAVE A NUMBER OF EXPIRED MASKS LIKE TWENTY MILLION. I WE DID GET PERMISSION FROM BOTH- CDC AND I ALSO TO USE THOSE MASKS THEY'VE BEEN STORED UNDER TEMPERATURE CONTROLLED WE'RE GETTING GUIDING WE JUST GOT THAT GUIDANCE FROM CDC. WE ARE OF DURING GUIDANCE- HERE TOMORROW FROM WITH ALONG WITH CAL OSHA SO THAT WE CAN THOSE IN. THIS OP. THE MOBILE ABOUT. HOUSE REALLY AND I AM SUB. SOME NOW SERVICE. I AN- LARGELY SHOW PROPER AS WE YOU UNDER FIVE FIRES BUT WE DON'T HAVE BEEN. SO AND A- I ALONG WITH THE- ON SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN PUT OUT INTO THE FIELDS OF MUTUAL AID REGIONS. AND THERE IS ONE THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE THAT. FIRES NOT CARD UP SO HOW FUNDS HELLO IT HAS SOME OF THE MATERIALS. WE ARE LOOKING YOU HAVE A- AND PUT SOME OF VENTILATOR. JUST OUT. HOSPITAL BUT THEY ARE WROTE BEING THEM IN USING THEM AND THAT. QUICK AND FORTY. BUYER AT. BUT INSURANCE POLICY BOUGHT IT FOR A BI FLU PLANNING TEN FIFTEEN YEARS A AND NOW WE ARE SORT OF LOOKING OUT RIGHT NOW WE MIGHT NEED IN THE FUTURE OF THE US. AND WERE COMPILING THAT LIST AND WORKING WITH TGS CARE WE HAVE ALSO FROM PUT IN AN ORDER FOR THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND NEW AND NINETY FIVE RESPIRATORS BUT GIVEN THE GLOBAL MARKET SHORTAGE WE DON'T EXPECT TO CAP UNTIL APRIL OR MAY. OKAY QUESTION THREE HAS SPENDING FOR LARGE SCALE PANDEMIC RESPONSES BEEN CUT UNDER PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS. I'M THE ONE PIECE THAT DID GET CAUGHT PRETTY QUICKLY AFTER WAS PUT IN PLACE AS WE HAD SIXTEEN MILLION FOR LOCAL PANDEMIC PLANNING NOT HUSBAND IT WAS CAUGHT THE VERY NEXT YEAR I CAN'T REMEMBER IF IT WAS TWO THOUSAND SIX OR TWO THOUSAND SEVEN IT WAS PUT IN PLACE IT'S NOW DOWN TO FOUR NINE NINE. ON THE- OKAY. QUESTION FOUR. WHAT IS THE CURRENT CONDITION YOUR ANSWER THIS OF THE TO FIELD HOSPITALS- SO THAT ONCE COVERED. IN ITS CURRENT CONFIGURATION ARE THE MOBILE UNITS SET UP IN A WAY THAT WOULD BE EFFECTIVE IN ADDRESSING THE SITUATION SEE SAID WE'RE BACK PILED AND GET IN THEIR WATERS AND MORE OF RIGHT NOW SET UP TO BE USED AS SHELTERS ON THEY ARE AS HOSPITALS WE ARE EXPLORING AS ADMINISTRATION OTHER THINGS WE COULD UE IF WE NEED TO EXPAND HEALTH CARE. KING I HOPE THAT. RECENTLY CLOSE TO OR- IN BANKRUPTCY OR YOU KNOW THE OTHER ONE THAT MIGHT BE AVAILABLE VERY QUICKLY AND BE READY FOR THAT USE. NOW IS THERE A THE AND TO SEE IT I'M YOU SAID A LOT OF THE MEDICAL SUPPLIES- WERE OUT OF STOCK. DO WE HAVE ANY ANSWERS ON WHEN THOSE THINGS ARE BEING RE STOCK OR ONE WILL HAVE THOSE RESOURCES THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH CDC TO PRIORITIZE THE HOSPITALS HAVE PAID IS OR WHO HAVE SUSPECT. OR CONFIRM CASES. AIRPORT TIES IN GETTING THEM THOSE SUPPLIES AND EQUIPMENT THERE'S ALSO OF AS YOU KNOW A FEDERAL STOCK STOCKPILE THAT COULD BE INVOKED IF WE NEED TO. ON THEIR NOT YET BREAKING INTO THE THINKING IT. GOT WORSE. ACTING NOW SUB BUT WE ARE WORKING. IT IS TO BE A TEMPORARY SHE FOR. LIKE MOSCOW GLOVE AND AYE PROTECTIVE GEAR BUT WE ARE WATCHING THAT WERE IN MENTORING OUR NEEDS WE ARE IN MENTORING THE HOSPITAL'S ON AND OUR LOCAL PARK. SEE WHAT I HAVE ON HAND. TIMELINE OR ANYTHING. THEY DON'T HAVE A TIME LINE. PUSHING IT PART AS WE CAN WE ARE- WORKING AT CDC AND HHS BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD REPATRIATION WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS BROUGHT INTO OUR- SO THEY DO SO. SAYS I ALREADY IN TERMS OF GOT IT. NEXT QUESTION. WE NEED. A LARGE SCALE MOBILE QWERTY FACILITIES. I'M MORE ARE WE THERE YET- WE GET THERE IS THAT SOMETHING SO AS YOU KNOW QUARANTINE AND I'M IN THE WORLD OF PUBLIC HEALTH QUARANTINE HAPPENS BEFORE YOU HAVE COMMITTEE EACH MISSION SO WHAT YOU HAVE ME TRANSIT AND WE MOVED TO MEDICATION AND THEN OUR GOAL BECOMES. GOING THE SPREAD AND SO CORPS ISN'T NECESSARILY THE NEXT STOP HOWEVER I AM I THINK WE ARE STILL LOOKING AT THE NEED FOR QUARANTINE AS WE TRY TO SLOW THE SPREAD. OF THIS DISEASE AND SO IF WE- VOTERS COMING AND THAT WE KNOW HOW TO EXPOSURE WE STILL WANT TO QUARANTINE THEM. BUT THIS DOES NOT- GET BAKER. YOU KNOW WE HAVE TURNED OUT- AND ARE MORE PEOPLE. THAT HAVE ALREADY RETURNED DIVERT TRAVELERS WHO ARE SELF DURING THE- SENATE BOMB HOT. PUSHERS AND ARE STILL BE TRAIN. VERY BASIS FOR THEIR FOR DAY. PERIOD I'M CAN DOWN THE DAYS TO COME NOT ONCE THEY BECOME POSITIVE OR THEY WILL NOT ALLOW THEM A THE BASE OF THAT'S WHY WE WOULD NEED A QUARANTINE FOR. CARE WOULD YOU RECOMMEND THE- OF ANY NEW MORE FOR BONDS INFRASTRUCTURE TO HELP BETTER PREPARE THIS. I'M IN THE I THINKI'M THE BEST ONE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. OKAY. NOW THEY REFUSE TO RESPOND IN WRITING AND SO THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING- LET'S SEE HERE. I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF OPTIONS AND IN SOME WAYS HARDEN BUILDINGS IF WE DIDN'T YOU KNOW OUR EASIER AND WE NEED TO HAVE SORT OF EVALUATE THAT AND ACROSS THE CONTINUUM OF CARE AND WHAT WE NEED. NOW AS FAR AS SMALLER SCALE PREPARATION ASSISTING LOCAL PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE SUCH AS SCHOOL DISTRICTS COUNTIES BLICK AXIS STILL USE WHICH PERSON PURCHASING NOT. THE BASICALLY CANCER EXEDRA FOR PROPER CLEANING AND SANITATION EQUIPMENT WHAT ARE WE DOING IN THAT FIELD SCHOOLS SCHOOLS AND OTHER STUFF- WE ARE NOT INVOLVED WITH THAT WE ARE GIVING GUIDANCE WELL YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING ALONG WITH STEVIE BUT I THINK THAT'S YEAH I'M THE OF EDUCATION AND. DO YOU FEEL IN GENERAL THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS PROPERLY YEAR RESOURCE TO HANDLE THIS SITUATION BOTH CURRENTLY IN LOOKING. FORWARD IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. I THINK WE'RE WORKING ON THAT RIGHT NOW AND THAT RIGHT NOW WE ARE NOT SPARING IT WE ARE REDIRECTING AS MANY PEOPLE AS WE NEED WE HAVE GOTTEN PERMISSION FROM CDC TO USE ANY BUT HEALTH SERVICE OFF THEY FIND. AND WE ARE ALSO ENDS ARE. HIRED THAN OTHERS HELP WITH. AND SO. AS WE NEEDS WE WILL RAISE THEM UP- WE'VE BEEN TOLD TO DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO- AND SO I DON'T THINK RESOURCES AND WILL WILL KEEP YOUR HAIR IF WE NEED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS IT'S NICE THAT YOU CAME PREPARED AND HAD SEVERAL QUESTIONS TO BE ABLE TO ASK- I DO WANT TO FOCUS. A LITTLE BIT ON IF I. GUARDING RESOURCES AND- WE TALKED ABOUT.

WHEN WE BEGAN IMPLEMENTATION ARE PROJECT CONTRACTOR HAD A GOAL OF ABOUT SOME OF THE AFTERWARD ABOUT 74% SO WE'RE REALLY EXCITED THAT FAMILIES ARE USING THAT. WE BY THE POINT FIVE MILLION. EIGHT SO WE'VE HAD REALLY A HANDFUL OF CALLS ABOUT ISSUES WITH THE CARD AND CONSIDERING TWO POINT FIVE MILLION TRANSACTION WE'RE REALLY REALLY PLEASED WITH HOW WELL THINGS ARE GOING. FAMILIES HAVE AN INCREDIBLY LEE POSITIVE ABOUT THE ROLLOUT ABOUT USING THE NEW CARD AND THE WAY OUT THEY'VE BEEN REALLY PATIENT IN THE LOCAL AGENCIES AS THOSE LOCAL AGENCY STAFF GETTING YOU TO THE NEW SYSTEM. STAY OF ROLE. FAIRFIELD THAT ONE OF THE SITES. AND OF PURCHASE OFFENSE AT ME THAT I WANT TO GET HER QUOTE RIGHT BECAUSE IT WAS IT WAS RIDLEY REALLY NICE. OF SURE. FLEXIBILITY AND SHOPPING WITH THAT MADE POSSIBLE WITH THE WHAT CARD WAS LIBERATING. AND THE ABILITY TO SCAN FOODS YOU OPT TO VERIFY THEIR AUTHORIZED IN HER FOOD BOUNCE FORCED WENT TO THE REGISTER. SHE SAID WAS EMPOWERING. OF THE LOCAL AGENCIES AND STORES TO BE SUCCESSFUL DURING THE ROLL OUT HAS BEEN A KEY PRIORITY FOR US WE HAVE NUMEROUS CALLS WITH LOCAL AGENCIES BEFORE THEY GET READY TO GO ROLL OUT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE READY. FELT MANY CALLS FOR LOW. TO YOU THERE'S WITH THEIR FAMILIES WE SEND STAFF OUT TO EVERY SINGLE SITE FOR EVERY SINGLE WAVE AND FIRST FEW LAPS DAYS OF GOAL WIFE SO WE'VE BEEN CRAP. THE WHAT. SAN TV. NEEDLE BISHOP AND EVERYWHERE IN BETWEEN OUR STAFF VISIT GROCERY STORES IN THE WEEKS PRIOR TO GO LIVE TO MAKE SURE THE STORES ARE READY TO GO OFTENTIMES THE STORE WILL REPORT THEY ARE. TO GO OUT AND TEST NOT IS READY MAY THE THOUGHT. TO WORK THEM AND MAKES THAT THEY ARE BE ABLE ABLE TO SUPPORT FAMILIES ON THOSE GO LIFE DAYS. THE EVA PROJECT REALLY IT'S BEEN A HUGE UNDERTAKING AND OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH PUBLIC HEALTH IT OFFICE. AS WELL AS HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES OFFICE OF SYSTEMS INTEGRATION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AS LONG AS WELL AS PROJECT CONTRACTORS AND OF COURSE LOCAL AGENCIES AND GROCERY STORE. HAS MADE THIS PROJECT HUGE BASS. AND LASTLY OF AN UPDATE ABOUT DECLINING PARTICIPATION IN OUR RESPONSE TO THAT. A WE'VE BEEN REPORTING THAT THE PASION THE WHAT PROGRAM HAS BEEN DECLINING CALIFORNIAN NATIONALLY SINCE ABOUT TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THE LAST LATEST DATA CAME FROM USDA REPORTS THAT CALIFORNIA'S COVERAGE RATE IS 61% WHILE THE NOW AVERAGES 50% SO WE'RE STILL. FOR TO SEE. AND BALTIMORE QUESTION PRESS BUT WE'RE DOING WE'RE DOING BETTER THAN MOST STATES BUT WE CAN ALWAYS IMPROVE. ENERGY FOCUSED THREE AREAS UNDERSTANDING REACHING AND SURVEYING SO A COUPLE EXAMPLES ABOUT WORK THAT WE'RE DOING UNDERSTAND THE DATA A FOR WE HAVE A DATA MATCH WITH MATT. PROGRAM DONE THAT SHOT MATCH TWICE ONCE LOOKING AT THE MARCH TWENTY EIGHTEEN DATA AND SECOND TIME LOOKING AT THE MARCH TWENTY NINETEEN DATA. AND THE RESULTS ABOUT INFO OLDER BOTH PROGRAM. AS WELL PROGRAM THE OTHER WE DON'T LOOK PREGNANT WOMEN. NO ONE ONE AS PREGNANT SO WHERE. JUST IN SOME CHILDREN IN THE STATE MATCH. THE MARCH TWENTY EIGHTEEN RESULTS SHOWED FIVE HUNDRED AND TWELVE THOUSAND INFANTS AND CHILDREN AND MEDI CAL THAT WE'RE NOT IN WORK AND THE INITIAL REACTION. GO OUT AND TRY TO REACH RECRUIT THE- BUT WE KNOW THOUGH THE WEIGHT COVERAGE RATES FOR INFANTS IS VERY HIGH. LOOK FURTHER INTO THE RESULTS AND WE MANY OF THESE CHILDREN HAD BEEN IN WORK IN THE PAST SO IT'S NOT TO SIMPLY READ THE CHILDREN TO TELL THEM ABOUT WHERE. WE THEY ARE PARTY NOW ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO UNDER. THEY LEFT THOSE IMPROVEMENTS PROGRAM. AND FOURTEEN THOUSAND INFANTS AND CHILDREN THAT WERE MEDI CAL AND WORKED. IT LOOKS LIKE THE SAME NUMBER BUT NOW THAT WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT YEARS WERE ABLE TO SEE THE CHANGE. SO WE HAD PRO FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN A ONE PROGRAM AND- IN BOTH THEY'RE BOTH PROGRAMS AND- THE OTHER SO WE'RE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND A LOT MORE. AND WHY. FAMILY IS TO. ONE PROGRAM THE OTHER. WE'VE ALSO REACHED CONDUCTED A STATEWIDE SURVEY IN COLLABORATION WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S NUTRITION POLICY INSTITUTE AND PUBLIC HEALTH FOUNDATION ENTERPRISES WHICH IS OUR LARGEST LARGEST WITH LOCAL AGENCY IT WAS STATE WIDE SERVE. ENGLISH MANAGED. INTO THE- WEEK FAMILIES THAT HAD A CHILD AGE ONE TO FOUR. MISS A MAJOR FINDINGS IN THAT RESULTS OF SURVEYS SHOW THAT FOOD AND EDUCATION WERE EQUALLY MOST IMPORTANT BENEFIT TO WORK SO WE'RE REALLY EXCITED TO SEE THAT THE EDUCATIONAL IS IMPORTANT. AS WELL. PRUDENT WILL KEY REASON IN THE FOOD Y. FAMILY STAYING AWAKE BUT THE BENEFIT THAT THEY RECEIVE HER FOOD SOME VEGETABLES IS NOT ENOUGH. ALSO ONE ON ONE IS THE MOST COMMON THE PER FOR PREFERRED METHOD OF NUTRITION EDUCATION WE HAD ASSUMED THAT. IT WOULD BE- MAYBE NOT THE FIRST BUT SOMETHING MORE ONLINE OR VIDEO WOULD BE THE TOP CHOICE BUT ON ONE ON ONE WAS THE TOP CHOICE. AND WE'RE REALLY EXCITED TO SEE THAT- ONE OF THE QUESTIONS ADDRESS- HAD THE FAMILY CHANGE THE FEEDING PRACTICE BECAUSE OF SOMETHING THEY LEARNED AT WORK IN A NATIONAL SURVEY SHOWED 60% CALIFORNIA EIGHTY FIVE SO WE'RE BY THAT WERE ABLE TO MAKE. UNDER A REACH CATEGORY A COUPLE THINGS THAT WERE WORKING ON WE'RE WORKING WITH KAISER PERMANENTE'S FOOD FOR LIFE INITIATIVE TO DEVELOP A BROAD SCALE TEXT MESSAGING CAMPAIGN TO CONNECT THEIR FAMILIES TO WORK. AND WE'RE ALSO DO OPENING IMPROVE TEXT MESSAGING LANGUAGE TO HELP IMPROVE INCREASE WITH APPOINTMENT ATTENDANCE FOR ALL PARTICIPANTS PARTICULAR. THING ON AFRICAN AMERICAN MOTHERS. I SERVE UP.

THE CARD OBVIOUSLY IS GOING TO BE- BUT WHAT WHAT OTHER IMPEDIMENTS ARE THERE OR WHAT WHAT'S MISSING YOUR PERSPECTIVE. SO THERE HAVE BEEN. HE'S ME THERE'VE BEEN A NUMBER OF- RESEARCH STUDIES NATIONALLY PARTICULARLY LOOKING AT WHY DO PEOPLE LEAVE PROGRAM THERE'S QUESTIONS ABOUT WHY DO PEOPLE DISCONTENT.

STILL THERE ARE ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS TO ME THE WAY. PERHAPS IN HOW FRAZIER SNAP. THERE MIGHT BE- IF THERE IS MORE TIME THAT YOU HAVE TO COME INTO THE OFFICE IT YOU HAVE TO CHECK IN WITH WHAT YOU'RE DOING NOT. THE CAN'T BUY ANYTHING THAT YOU WANT WITH THE BENEFITS AND SO WE DO SEE THAT SOME OF THOSE BARRIERS ABOUT SHOPPING ARE COMING IN IF I GET JENNIFER APPOINTMENTS.

AGAIN RICHARD MYSELF I'M CA MITCHELL DEBBIE TO CENTER FOR FAMILY HEALTH IN WITH THE INSTRUCTOR ALL THE FROM ONE OF OUR DIVISION GENET DISEASE SCREENING BROKE. PROGRAM GOOD AFTERNOON I'M RICHARD ONLY A THE VISION FOR TONIGHT'S THE SCREENING PROGRAM ALSO KNOW AS TO THE- SO I'M JUST GONNA PRESS S. FOR YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND ESTIMATE AND GOVERNOR'S BY SHOWS TOTALING. OF A HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION WHICH AS YOU KNOW ARE FOR SUPPORTED THROUGH THE CHEN DISEASE TEST FUN. THIS TOTAL IS VIRTUALLY ON. FROM THE NAY TO BUDGET ACT. OF OUR TOTAL X. APPROX 80% ARE FOR US. OUR LOCAL SYSTEMS FONG SUPPORT. FOR THE NEWBORN SCREENING PROGRAM IN THE PRENATAL SCREENING PROGRAM AND FOR OPERATIONAL SUPPORT. FOR THE UPCOMING BUT YOU'RE THE OUR ESTIMATE SHOWS AN OVERALL SLIGHT DECREASE AND LOCAL ASSISTANCE WITH A VERY SMALL CHANGE IN PRENATAL SCREENING EXPENDITURES TUTOR CASELOAD ADJUSTMENTS. DECREASE SPENDING FOR OPERATIONAL SUPPORT DUE TO A DROP OFF IN ONE TIME FUNDING FOR NEW INSTRUMENTS AND DATABASE UPGRADES. IN AN INCREASE IN NEWBORN SCREENING EXPENDITURES. SO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT WERE WE'LL BE ADDING A NEW CONDITIONS SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY OR SMA. TO THE CALIFORNIA NEWBORN SCREENING PANEL BY JULY TWENTY TWENTY. AND THAT'S REQUIRED BY THE CURRENT CALIFORNIA'S STATUTORY PROVISIONS FOR EXPANDING SCREENING BECAUSE SMA WAS ADDED TO THE FEDERAL RECOMMENDED UNIFORM SCREENING PANEL IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AS WHEN WE ADDED TO OTHER NEW DISORDERS TO THE CALIFORNIA PANEL IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE'RE PROJECTING INCREASED EXPENDITURES AND THE ARE COMING FISCAL YEAR FOR NEWBORN SCREENING. NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE COST OF SCREENING ITSELF BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF COSTS THAT WE COVER FOR FOLLOW UP A CASE MANAGEMENT AND COORDINATION- FOLLOW UP CENTERS DIAGNOSTIC TESTING FOR SCREEN POSITIVE INFANTS. AND SYSTEM UPGRADES. THE TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET ACTS INCLUDED ADDITIONAL EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY TO SUPPORT IMPLEMENTATION AND ONGOING COSTS FOR SMA SCREENING. BUT THERE HAS BEEN NO FEE INCREASE TO COVER INCREASED EXPENDITURES SINCE TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHICH WAS THE LAST TIME DISORDERS ARE ADDED TO OUR PANEL. SO WE ARE NOW PROJECTING A NEED FOR A NEWBORN SCREENING FEE INCREASE TO SUPPORT. ONGOING SMA SCREEN CAUSES WAS OFFSETTING INCREASE FOLLOW ACROSS FOR NEW DISORDERS IDENTIFIED THROUGH EXPANDED NEWMAN SCREENING. IT'LL BE A SCREENING ONLY- WHICH WILL BE NEEDED BEGINNING IN JULY TWENTY TWENTY. AND THIS WOULDBE APPROVED THROUGH THE USUAL RULE MAKING PROCESS. I WITH US INCREASE OUR TOTAL REVENUES WITH THAT INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 12% AND THE UPCOMING BUDGET YEAR. AND THAT WILL MORE CLOSELY ALIGN OUR REVENUES WHETHER EXPENDITURES. AND THE AMOUNT OF THIS PROPOSED FEE INCREASE WILL ALSO IMPROVE THE GSP FUND CONDITION AND BALANCE NEED REVENUES FROM THE PRENATAL AND NEWBORN SCREENING SIDES OF GDS P. THE REVENUE CALCULATIONS ARE BASED ON OUR CASE FOR PROJECTIONS FOR THE UPCOMING BUDGET YEAR WHICH IS FOR APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND BIRTHS STATEWIDE AND THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND PARTICIPANTS IN THE PRENATAL SCREENING PROGRAM.

WITH ALLOCATION OF THESE FUNDS LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICE SUCH AS ROUTINE CONTACT AND FOLLOW UP WITH CLIENTS. REFERRALS AND CONNECTIONS TO PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS AND HEALTH AND SOCIAL NEEDS ASSESSMENTS. WITH ME TO TODAY TO TESTIFY IS TRULY TRULY RAYMONDO DIRECTOR OF THE SUMMER DO NOT COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN NUMBERS MY NAME IS DETERMINED OF THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC HEALTH FOR SALMON TINO COUNTY. AND I AM HERE TODAY FORMALLY TO URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THE TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND ALLOCATION COMING FROM THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION. OF CALIFORNIA- AND THISFUNDING WILL ALLOW LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS A TO PROVIDE NAVIGATION COORDINATION SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING AYE THE REINFECTION OR WHAT WE CALL COMPLEX CASES OF STDS. I'M TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF PERSPECTIVE IN A MEDINA COUNTY IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN A LOT. WE HAVE A TWELVE HUNDRED CASE CEPHALUS. OF THOSE THIRTY THREE WERE ACTUALLY RE INFECTIONS AND THOUGH THAT MAY SEEM LIKE A SMALL NUMBER SIXTEEN OF THOSE THIRTY THREE ACTUALLY CONTRACTED SYPHILIS MORE THAN WALKS. ON IN THAT TIME FOR IT. FREE GOOGLE LIST A GONE FROM A OF CASES IN TWO IF YOU. A WHAT WE- ARE WHICH IS A CAR HI. SIX SIX PROBLEM CASES. INTO NINETEEN BETWEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN WE ACTUALLY DOUBLED OUR NUMBER OF CONGENITAL SYPHILIS CASES FROM. THIRTY THREE TO SIXTY SIX. IN A LOT OF THESE- CONGENITAL SYPHILIS CASES IN A LOT OF THESE REINFECTION CASES- WHAT WE ARE STRUGGLING WITH IS ULTIMATELY THIS COMPLEX WEB OF SOCIAL ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES- THAT ARE UNDERLYING A LOT OF THE REASON AND A LOT OF THE INCREASES- WE ARE EXPERIENCING CLIENTS THAT ARE DEALING WITH POVERTY- DEALING WITH HOMELESSNESS. PRIOR INCARCERATION SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISPARITIES IN ACCESS TO CARE AND OFTENTIMES WE ARE SEEING SEEING SITUATIONS WHERE CLIENTS ARE EXCHANGING SEX FOR MONEY HOUSING AND OTHER RESOURCES. AND SO ULTIMATELY LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE NOT ONLY BEING DEL BEING ASKED TO DEAL WITH THE TREATMENT ASPECT- BUT THERE ARE UNDERLYING ISSUE THAT I THINK WE ALL NEED TO ADDRESS IN ORDER TO DO OUR JOB PROPERLY THE WHOLE TOMORROW. BILLY ARE. WELL BE ABLE TO DELIVER THESE. AS WE HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE BEING ABLE TO DEAL WITH THE FLOOR VULNERABLE AND VERY DIFFICULT TO REACH POPULATIONS. ULTIMATELY THERE IS NO SPECIFIC FUNDING THAT ALLOWS US. TO DO THIS KIND OF WORK AND LIKE THAT I'D LIKE TO END OFF WITH THE PARTICULAR CASE THAT WE HAVE EXPERIENCED RECENTLY AND SALMON DINO- TO BE ABLE TO PUT KIND OF A FACE TO THE ISSUE. A WE HAD A THIRTY FOUR YEAR OLD FEMALE ON THAT THANK THANKFULLY DID REPORT TO HER OB GIN- WHEN SHE WAS FOUR MONTHS PREGNANT- SHE WAS TESTED AND TYPICALLY CAME UP POSITIVE FOR SYPHILIS. OF THE WRITER DID CONTACT THE PUBLIC DEPARTMENT. AND WE'LL- THE WRITER THE THIS PARTICULAR PATIENT HER TREATMENT WOULD BE ONE INJECTION OF PENICILLIN THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN EVERY SEVEN DAYS FOR THREE WEEKS. LEAVE THE PROVIDER STAFF CONTACT US A FEW WEEKS LATER BECAUSE THEY WERE UNABLE TO CONNECT WITH THE PATIENT. OF THE PROVIDER OUR OWN STAFF OR COMMUTER WILL DISEASE INVESTIGATORS THEN WENT ABOUT THEIR JOB- THEY MADE MULTIPLE PHONE CALLS THEY SENT LETTERS TO MULTIPLE ADDRESSES. AND ACTUALLY WENT OUT INTO THE FIELD TWICE- IN ORDER TO FIND THIS PARTICULAR PATIENT- THEIR PERSISTENCE FINALLY PAID OFF. A THEY WERE FINALLY ABLE TO CONNECT WITH THE PATIENT AND THAT'S WHEN THEY DISCOVERED THAT THE REAL REASON BEHIND HER NON COMPLIANCE. WAS TRANSPORTATION. AS WELL AS HOMELESSNESS- THROUGH THEIR EDUCATION THOUGH THEY WERE ABLE TO EDUCATE THE CLIENT ABOUT THE POSSIBLE TRANSMISSIBILITY OF THE DISEASE. FROM THE MOTHER TO THE FEEDER. WELL SO THE- CONSEQUENCES THE- THANKS FOR ALL WE FEEL TO MY- SHE- TO TREATMENT- THEY WORKED WITH HER IN ORDER TO MAKE APPOINTMENTS AND SHE EVEN AGREE TO TAKE THE BUS- TO HER PARTICULAR APPOINTMENT. ULTIMATELY THE PATIENT WENT TO THE APPOINTMENT AND WHAT WE DISCOVERED LATER WAS THAT SHE WAS INFORMED DURING THE APPOINTMENT THAT THE MEDICATION SHE NEEDED WAS NOT AVAILABLE. WITH THE PROVIDER AND THAT HER EMERGENCY MEDICAL WAS NOT GOING TO COVER THE TREATMENT WHEN THE PATIENT WAS RESCHEDULED NOT SURPRISINGLY SHE DID NOT COMPLY AND SHE DID NOT WHAT. AGAIN AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS OUR COMMUNITY WILL DISEASE INVESTIGATORS WERE BACK OUT IN THE FIELD- EVENTUALLY FOUND HER AGAIN AGAIN SHE AGREED TO TREATMENTS- SHE DID GO TO TREATMENT SHE DID RECEIVE THE TREATMENT HOWEVER AFTER THE TREATMENT OUR PROVIDER CONTACTED US AGAIN. YES SHE RECEIVED A TO THE THREE TREATMENTS BUT HER SECOND DOSE OF WAS THE INCORRECT AMOUNT. AND SO WHAT WE WERE LEFT WITH WAS THAT. OUR COMMUNICABLE DISEASE INVESTIGATOR THAN HAVE TO NOTIFY THE PROVIDER BUT THIS POOR PATIENT HAD TO RETART THE ENTIRE TREATMENT- AND THAT ULTIMATELY THE BABY WAS NOW GOING TO NEED SOME KIND GENTLE TREATMENT AND FOLLOW UP- BECAUSE ALL OF THAT NEED TO BE DONE WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OF DELIVERY. WHAT THIS FOR THIS MOTHER IS THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO LEAVE THE HOSPITAL WITHIN FORTY EIGHT HOURS BUT HER BABY HAD TO STAY HOSPITALIZED FOR TEN DAYS IN ORDER TO RECEIVE IV TREATMENT AN IV THERAPY. THIS RESULTED IN A LOT BONDING BETWEEN THE MOTHER AND THE CHILD. AND FRANKLY IN CARD EXTRA THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM FOR WHAT IS A COMPLETELY PREVENTABLE DISEASE- THIS PARTICULAR CASE. LASTED FIVE MONTHS- WHEN PRESENTED TO OUR BE GENTLE THE BIRTH OF A BABY THE INVESTIGATION INVOLVED NUMEROUS PHONE CALLS- TO A MULTITUDE OF OUR CONTACTS SEVERAL LETTERS. MY STAFF WERE OUT IN THE FIELD TRYING TO TRACK HER DOWN ON- AND ULTIMATELY IT'S JUST A LOT OF MEDICAL COVERAGE. IN A PER. OR NAY EDUCATION AT THE PROVIDER LEVEL THERE'S TRANSPORTATION ISSUES THERE WAS HOMELESSNESS ISSUES ALL OF THESE RESULTING IN BARRIERS THAT RESULTED IN A CONGENITAL SYPHILIS CASE THAT WAS PREVENTABLE ON SO MANY LEVELS DESPITE THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT DESPITE ALL THE WORK OF MY STAFF DID DO WAS WERE THE THINGS THAT THEY COULD NOT DO BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF FUNDING THEY WERE NOT A RESULT HER LISTENING SURE SHE AND THE BABY COULD RETURN TO A STABLE ENVIRONMENT- WE'RE NOT. ABLE TO SOLVE. BEHAVE BUT SHE MAY HAVE A- IN ORDER TO PUT HER IN THAT POSITION OR ANY OTHER SOCIAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES THAT SHE MAY HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH AND SO ULTIMATELY SHE MAY END UP BACK- WITH PUBLIC HEALTH UNDER INVESTIGATION. AND SO AGAIN GIVEN THE UNPRECEDENTED A RISE IN STDS THAT WE ARE SEEING THROUGHOUT THE STATE- I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT- THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION. TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET ASK- IN ORDER TO RESOLVE THIS PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE AND THIS GAP THANK YOU THANK YOU MA'AM WE WILL NOW TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE SEVENTEEN. MICHELLE GIVEN THE CHECK AT AS THE CASE ILLUSTRATED THERE IS A NEED FOR SOME FUNDING DEDICATED TO THESE THESE CASES WHERE IT'S HIGH TOUCH HER HIGH NEED. A WE RECOGNIZE AND HAVING DISCUSSIONS ABOUT OUR MEMBERSHIPS THAT RE AND THERE WERE A NUMBER OF JURISDICTION SEEING INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING INFECTIONS AND THEN THERE ARE ALSO A NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS IT'S ALL INDIVIDUALS WITH COMPLEX CASES SO INDIVIDUALS WITH. A ONE EXAMPLE IS THIRTEEN STDS AT ONE TIME THERE'S OTHER COMPLEX CASES WHERE THERE I ALSO THIS. APARTMENT WOMEN WITH SYPHILIS WHO REQUIRES A HIGHER TOUCH- WE RECOGNIZE AND YOU'LL HEAR MANY. PROPOSALS AFTER US AROUND STDS EACH TV IN HIV WERE SUPPORTIVE OF THE BALL WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR TESTING SCREENING A PREVENTION BUT THERE'S ALSO A NEED FOR. AT FUNDING DEDICATED SO THAT WE CAN FOLLOW UP IN CIRCUMVENT SOME OF THESE- GREATER SOCIAL ISSUES ISSUES THAT ARE HAPPENING SUCH AS HOMELESSNESS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WHERE ART WE'RE SEEING OUR CLIENTS MULTIPLE TIMES AND IT COULD BE AT.

WE DON'T TALK ABOUT LEGISLATION BUT I MIGHT BE A CO AUTHOR ON A MASTER PLAN BUILDING THE SIMILAR AREA AND SO- I DID WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE FORTY SEVEN SECOND PARAGRAPH THERE'S A SENTENCE THAT SAYS UNFORTUNATELY HIV HABSI AND S. T. EYES HAVE NOT BEEN ADEQUATELY PRIORITIZED AND CAL AIM TO ENSURE MEDI CAL AND ROLLED EASE OUR PROP AT SCREENED CAN YOU EXTRAPOLATE ON THAT LITTLE BIT AND HELP TO EXPLAIN WE HAVE NOT HAD HEARINGS REGARDING CAL AIM AT. WELL AS THE LA CAME OUT WITH- REPORT ON CALLIN TODAY BUT JUST YEAH I WANTED YOU TO ADD A LITTLE MORE TO THAT IF YOU COULD YEP YES SO I'M CERTAINLY NOT THE EXPERT ON CALLAHAM SO SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE VARIOUS WORK GROUPS THAT BEEN WORKING ON CAL AIM. I THINK THE POINT OF THAT COMMENT IS JUST RECOGNIZING THAT IF THE DAY AS A STRIP CHECK LIVE TO RUSTY DEMI THERE WOULD BE ST INITIATIVE WILL WITH CAL AIM MISSING OUT CONTROL THE FOLKS HAVE ACCESS TO TESTING AND TREATMENT. I AN EXIT POLL. IN A ANSWER I TALKS ABOUT VALUE BASED IN SHOULD'VE SO AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE DO NOT IN THE KERN CALENDAR. IN TERMS OF. PROVIDING VALUE BASED PAYMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS ARE BARELY SUPPRESSED FOR MAKING SURE THAT FOLKS- RECEIVE TESTING AND SO. I THINK THE IDEA IS THAT IF THE STATE HAD ROLLED FORWARD. AS YOU KNOW HAD MORE STRATEGIC FOCUS ON THESE INITIATIVES THAT CAL AIM- WOULD HAVE MORE OF A FOCUS ON MAKING SURE THAT FOLKS HAVE. ACCESS TO THE SERVICES THEY NEED- I MASS THAT WE- BRING THAT UP WHEN WE HAVE THE HEARING TO SEE- AND JUST TO. BE CLEAR FOR THOSE WHO ARE WATCHING COLIN IS ALSO KNOWN AS MEDICAL HEALTHIER CALIFORNIA FOR ALL- IT IS. ACRONYM IS SUPPOSED TO STAND FOR ADVANCING IN INNOVATING WITHIN MEDI CAL. AND THE GOAL IN MANY PARTS IS TO. LEAVE DECREASE THE NUMBER OF SILENCE WE HAVE BEEN HELD.

THE H. EPIDEMIC I'M- RAN. IN A- CHEN IN CALIFORNIA DOES AGAIN SHOW THAT ASSESSMENT WORKS. ARE BIG. SEE THAT THE NEW ATV I'M- THE CALL THANK. I'M BUT THAT HEALTH INEQUITIES ARE CONTINUING TO INCREASE OF BETWEEN. EIGHTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NUMBER. CASE TO CREATE. DECREASED I'M AT SPEND THE PERCENT AMONG- WHITE POPULATION. AND ONLY FOR ANIMAL NOW AND- PRIEST TO PRESS AMONG POP. I'M THE IT USING A RISK ARE THERE NEED TO AND EXPAND EACH PER POT F. FOR THIS POPULAR WE DO REALLY IT THE EFFORT OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE DOLLARS THAT WE GOT STE YEAR WERE. APPARENTLY AND THEY- AGAIN WAS MENTIONED EARLIER RECEIVED SIXTY OVER SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS AND REQUEST- FOR FUNDING FOR OVER AND I THINK THEY ARE ONLY ALLOCATING ABOUT FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION SO THE NEED IS THERE- THEY'RE DOING A GOOD JOB WITH THE DOLLARS THEY GET AND MAKING SURE THAT IT GOES THE POPULAR AND COMMUNITIES ARE AT ME NEED BUT WE MORE DOLLARS ESSENTIALLY- SO GRANTS TO LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF EVIDENCE BASED AND STRENGTH A STRATEGIES THAT INCLUDE BIOMEDICAL AND STRUCTURAL INTERVENTIONS.

SO AGAIN THE AND THAT BUT I MIX COALITION WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST THE BUDGET AUTHORITY TO INCREASE THE IT IS STRUCK ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. IMPROPER OUT ELIGIBILITY PROGRAM FROM LEVEL SIX HUNDRED AT THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL IN ORDER TO BETTER ALIGN WITH THE NEW STATES CITIES VIRGIL'S A INCOME ALL FOR THE- AND THE- AS YOU HEARD MENTOR. THAT ADAM STATE EIGHT APP RE RE. WHERE AND WE BELIEVE THAT THOSE REBATES CAN BE USED TO PAY FOR THIS INCREASE- SO IT CALIFORNIA'S EIGHT OUT PROGRAM AND PROP UP ARE THE BACKBONE OF OUR EFFORTS TO AN H. A. B. ADEPT AT AMICK- EIGHT OUT PROVIDES FINANCIAL. MEDICATIONS HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND MEDICAL OUT OF POCKET COSTS FOR LOW INCOME RESIDENTS LIVING WITH. HIV AND COVERS THIRTY ONE OR PROVIDES. A SERVICE THIRTY ONE THOUSAND CALIFORNIA EACH YEAR. AND THEN PROP UP WHICH IS A NEWER PROGRAM. THEY EAT BALL AT AM AT AND ISSUED AS WELL YEARS AGO. COVERS PROP AND PEPPER LATE AND MEDICAL EXPENSES AND MEDICATION COSTS FOR LOW INCOME RESIDENTS WHO ARE AT RISK OF ACQUIRING H. A. B. AND SINCE IT LAUNCHED INTO TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE PROGRAM IS ALREADY HELPED OVER THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS ACCESS PREP AND PAP. ATV PREVENTION IT UP AS A THREE FORTY B. ENTITY AND AS SUCH COLLECTS A MANDATORY REBATE- FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE MEDICATIONS ARE PRESCRIPTIONS COVERED- IT ALSO RECEIVES VOLUNTARY SUPPLEMENTAL REBATES- ABOVE AND BEYOND THREE FORTY P. AND THOSE ARE NEGOTIATED A FEDERAL AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WITH THE OTHER EIGHT OUT PROGRAMS THROUGH THAT I'M EIGHT OUT CRISIS TASK FORCE ON THESE REBATES ARE REALLY DRIVING- THE PROGRAM RIGHT NOW SO THESE REBATES COUNT FOR ROUGHLY THREE QUARTERS OF THE OF THE PROGRAM'S BUDGET. I'M TWENTY FIFTEEN M. WE WERE SUCCESSFUL ARE YOU ARE- KIND ENOUGH TO INCREASE ELIGIBILITY LEVEL TO FIVE HUNDRED PERCENT. FROM A FLAT FIFTY THOUSAND AND THAT WAS AGAIN REFLECTING THE NEED IN THE COMMUNITY AND THE INCREASING COST OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA- AND WE'RE BACK BECAUSE THOSE COSTS CONTINUE TO INCREASE. I AM VERY SUPPORT FEATHER THE INCREASE. THE LEVELS FOR COVER CALIFORNIA AND WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE SAME HAPPEN IN THIS PROGRAM. WE ESTIMATE THAT THAT CHANGE WITH A VERY SMALL IMPACT- ON THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL SERVERS SO IT'S NOT A HUGE COST BUT FOR THE FOLKS THAT WOULD NOW BE ELIGIBLE IT'S I'M HUGELY IMPACTFUL- AND WOULD REALLY- MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE SO. WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS PROPOSAL- YEAH THANK YOU THANK YOU MA'AM WILL NOW TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT FOR ISSUE FIFTEEN. PROPOSED FOR MADE KELLY HELP AND SUPPORT SIR. JERRY AT NINE THIS LOZENGES LGBT CENTER IN SUPPORT YOU. WHAT'S THE SEVERAL GLIDE IN SUPPORT. JENNA HE WOULD AT THE NATIONAL HARM REDUCTION COALITION IN SUPPORT. ROB HAVE BACK IN SUPPORT YOU.

KELLY BROOKS ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. MICHELLE GIVEN TO THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. THANK YOU MA'AM SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON BRING IT UP TO THE SUB COMMITTEE- YOU SAID THERE WERE NEGLIGIBLE COST I WAS HOPING YOU COULD EXTRAPOLATE A LITTLE BIT- SINCE. THEY ARE COVERED BY A REBATES- IS IT WHAT WOULD THE COST BE TO THE STATE IF ANYTHING HOWEVER IT AT SUBMITTED A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE REQUEST TO GET THE COSTS BUT WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED- AN ANSWER YET SO I CAN GET BACK. YOU WHEN WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION. SENSUALLY REBATE FUNDS CAN BE USED TO COVER THAT- INCREASE CLIENT LOAD SO. IT SHOULDN'T NEED ADDITIONAL GENERAL FUND TO COVER THIS INCREASE. FROM THE BUDGET NEUTRAL THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT FOR THE COMMITTEE AS- BUT WE DID MAKE SIGNIFICANT STRIDES LAST YEAR TO WORK ON AFFORDABILITY WITH SUBSIDIES UP CONSISTENT WITH. KURT I WOULD JUST WANT TO. INSURE AND WOULD APPRECIATE THAT FEEDBACK WHEN YOU GET IT. I'M WITH THAT WILL HOLD ISSUE FIFTEEN OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE SIXTEEN. HI I'M ENTIRELY ON THE DIRECTOR OF STATE HEALTH CARE POLICY THE SAN FRANCISCO AIDS FOUNDATION. AND I'D LIKE TO FIRST THOUGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN ECHO THE THANKS FOR THE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ALLOCATED LAST YEAR FOR H. CV OR HEPATITIS C. PREVENTION FUNDS. ON WE'D ALSO LIKE TO URGE YOU TO CONSIDER CONVERTING THOSE FUNDS TO ONGOING FUNDS ON THIS YEAR. YOUR TO ASPER FIFTY IN DOLLARS FOR HEPATITIS C. PREVENTION SERVICES INCLUDING HEALTH NAVIGATION LINK LINKAGE SERVICES WITH A FOCUS ON PEOPLE WHO USE DRUGS. CALIFORNIA'S SERIOUSLY DURING UNDER INVESTED IN- HEPATITIS C. PREVENTION RIGHT NOW EVEN WITH THE ALLOCATION OF THE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FROM LST YEAR WE HAD JUST BARELY OVER FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. TO SUPPORT ALL OF THESE PREVENTION SERVICES THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE WITH CULTURALLY COMPETENT. AND QUALITY CARE HEALTH CARE. I'M CURRENTLY A WE HAVE AN ESTIMATED FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS LIVING WITH HEPATITIS C. OVER HALF OF THEM DON'T EVEN KNOW THEIR STATUS RIGHT NOW THE RATE OF HCV INFECTION AMONG YOUTH PARTICULARLY THOSE UNDER THIRTY IS GROWING AT AN ALARMING RATE IT'S DRIVEN BY THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC ALSO INJECTIONS. OF HEROIN AND OTHER DRUG USE BETWEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TWENTY SIXTEEN A TOTAL OF. WERE REPORTED AMONG PEOPLE AGED FIFTY TWENTY NOT 50% INCREASE. UNINTENTIONALLY WE HAD CASES OF HEPATITIS C. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA RANKED. FIRST IN STATES THAT REPORTED THEIR HEPATITIS C. SURVEILLANCE THAT YEAR. SO JUST TODAY THE U. S. PREVENTIVE SERVICES TASK FORCE ISSUED ITS FINAL RECOMMENDATION OF A GRADE B. FOR UNIVERSAL HCV TESTING FOR ALL ADULTS AGED EIGHTEEN THROUGH SEVENTY NINE. AND THEY BASE OF THEIR EVIDENCE IN PART THAT HCV IS ASSOCIATED WITH MORE DEATH FROM THE TOP THE OTHER TOP SIXTY REPORTABLE INFECTIOUS DISEASES. AND ALSO THAT UNIVERSAL SCREENING COULD HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL NET BENEFIT IN TERMS OF IMPROVED HEALTH OUTCOMES AND AVERTED HEALTHCARE COSTS. THE TASK FORCE ALSO CITED RESEARCH SUGGESTING THAT HEALTH CARE SETTING SERVING PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE PEOPLE THOSE FOR LOW INCOME UNINSURED OR UNDERSERVED. HAD VERY LOW RATES OF HCV SCREENING UNDER THE PREVIOUS RECOMMENDATIONS AND STATED THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF A SUCCESSFUL SCREENING MAY REQUIRE ADDRESSING. VARIOUS BARRIERS TO SCREENING AND TREATMENT AND DISEASE AND DIVERSE POPULATIONS. SO THE INVESTMENT THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR TODAY WOULD BEGIN TO AN ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE BARRIERS PARTICULARLY FOR FOLKS WHO ARE USING DRUGS. OUT REGION PREVENTION SERVICES ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE USING DRUGS WHO ARE OFTEN DISENFRANCHISED FROM TRADITIONAL RESOURCES AND HEALTH CARE NETWORKS AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY STIGMA. A RECENT REPORT BY THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCE ENGINEERING MEDICINE FOUND THE KEY BARRIER TO CARE FOR THOSE USING DRUGS WAS STIGMA AND THAT IT PREVENTED PEOPLE FROM SEEKING IN ACCESSING CARE AND ALSO AFFECTED EFFECTIVE PROVIDER PATIENT RELATIONSHIPS. RESEARCH FROM THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE STEP STUDY OF LIVER DISEASES FOUND THAT ADDRESSING GAPS IN PREVENTION CARE AMONG YOUTH IS ESSENTIAL TO ADDRESSING THE HCV EPIDEMIC. SO ARE PROPOSED INVESTMENT WOULD ALLOW US TO BILL AND SUCCESSFUL DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS WERE FUNDED HERE IN CALIFORNIA IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN AND WE ESTIMATE THAT 95% OF THOSE WHO ARE LINKED TO IN RETAINING CARE THROUGH THE PROJECTS WERE ACTUALLY CURED. SO ON THIS INVESTMENT COULD SUPPORT BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE AND THIRTY PROGRAMS NEW PROGRAMS. AS WELL AS FUND- AS WELL AS PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED FUNDED FOR FUNDING FOR THE OFFICE OF VIRAL HEPATITIS PREVENTION AT CITY PH. ON SO THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE OVERSIGHT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND- AFFECTED MONITORING OF HIV IN CALIFORNIA. THEY ALSO JUST WANTED TO COMMENT ON THE FACT THAT WITH THE FIVE MILLION DOLLAR- ALLOCATION LAST YEAR WE DID WANT TO COMMEND. THE CITY PH IN THE WAY THAT THEY ALLOCATED THOSE FUNDS WAS VERY THOUGHTFUL AND HAD A LOT OF COMMUNITY. INPUT EVEN. THOUGH THE FABRIC LIMITED AND NOT NEARLY BUT WE NEED SO WE HAVE AS YOU KNOW AND THEN PRESS THE PRESIDENT A CHANCE RIGHT NOW TO ACTUALLY AND H. CD IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE. SIMPLE AND RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE EIGHT TO TWELVE WEEKS TREATMENT PROTOCOLS. THAT PROVIDE CURE RATES OF 95% ON. TREATING PEOPLE FOR H. CV CAN IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES ARE DRAMATICALLY INCREASES HEALTH LIFE EXPECTANCY AND IT DEFINITELY REDUCES OVERALL HEALTH CARE EXPENDITURES. BUT IN ORDER TO REACH THOSE OUTCOMES WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO HAVE THE- ESPECIALLY FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS WE HAVE TO HAVE THE PREVENTIVE SERVICES THAT MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO ACCESS. THAT THAT QUALITY CARE AND TREATMENT. THANK YOU MA'AM WELL NOW TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE SIXTEEN. YEAH WOULD BE GOT THREE MENDOCINO COUNTY AIDS VIRAL HEPATITIS NETWORK AND WHAT'S FUNNY ABOUT THAT IS THAT WE HAVE NO DEDICATED- HCV FUNDING AND ALL THE FUNDING THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS HAS COME FROM FOUNDATIONS AND CHICAGO AND NEW YORK IN A VARIETY OF OTHER PLACES BUT THERE IS NO INVESTMENT IN OUR OWN COUNTY WERE THE ONLY PROVIDER OF- PREVENT IN EDUCATION OF OUTREACH SERVICES. CONNECT PEOPLE TO. AND WE DON'T RECEIVE A DOLLAR FOR ANY OF THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU MA'AM. IN STRONG SUPPORT. WESLEY SAID WITH BLOOD IN STRONG SUPPORT JUST A COMMENT EACH MONTH ARE HARM REDUCTION MOBILE OUTREACH TEAM% IN SAN FRANCISCO- ADMINISTERS MORE THAN THIRTY SIX HUNDRED H. I.

TREATMENT THANK YOU. KIMBERLY ROBINSON WITH BLACK WOMEN FOR WELLNESS AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. MICHELLE GIVEN TO THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THANK YOU. KELLY BROOKS ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HERE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON BRING IT UP TO THE SUB COMMITTEE- AND AT THIS TIME WE WILL HOLD ISSUE SIXTEEN OPEN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION HOUSEKEEPING WE'VE ALREADY TAKEN CARE OF ISSUE SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN SO WE ARE NOW ON TO ISSUE IN NINETEEN. AND AS WE HAVE HEATHER MYERS MAKE HER WAY UP TO THE FRONT I ALSO WANTED TO TAKE A MOMENT TO EXPLAIN. WHY THIS IS ONE OF THE PROPOSALS IN WHICH I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS YEAR IN TWO THOUSAND THREE WE AS A LEGISLATURE HAD PASSED A LAW THAT IF YOU ARE GOING TO TEACH SEX EDUCATION. YOU ALSO HAD A TEACHER B. T. Q. OR YOU COULDN'T TEACH SEX EDUCATION AT ALL. I WAS FROM ONE OF THE COUNTIES THAT DECIDED TO STOP TEACHING SEX EDUCATION IN TWO THOUSAND THREE. IT WASN'T UNTIL TWENTY FIFTEEN WHEN WE AS A LEGISLATURE PASSED THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH THE YOUTH ACT A STORK ACHIEVEMENT FOR CALIFORNIA. THAT ENSURED THAT WE WOULD. HAVING A COMPREHENSIVE MEDICALLY ACCURATE AND AGE APPROPRIATE AS WELL AS INCLUSIVE EDUCATIONAL POLICY. SINCE THEN WE HAVE HAD INCONSISTENT- IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS TO CREATE EDUCATIONAL DISPARITIES AMONG CALIFORNIA'S YOU RIGHT NOW. WHILE THIS HAS BEEN GOING FAIRLY WELL THERE ARE STILL AREAS IN THE STATE THAT STILL STRUGGLE WITH THIS INCLUDING MY DISTRICT AND STATEWIDE WE'VE SEEN THE RATES OF STD CONTINUE TO INCREASE OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS. NEARLY ONE THIRD OF COUNTIES LAST YEAR ALONE HAD A 10% INCREASE AND GONORRHEA. AND WHILE WE NOTICED THAT CD PH THE DISPARITIES THAT WERE MOST AWARE OF ARE THE FACT THAT IT'S OUR YOUNGER POPULATION IT'S THOSE BETWEEN THE AGES OF FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR. FOLLOWING THE RECESSION THAT WE HAD IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TO TWELVE THERE WAS A 72% DECREASE IN THE TOTAL SPENDING ON PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT THE DELIVERY OF IN CLASSROOM AND COMMUNITY SEX EDUCATION. BETTER KNOWN AS TEEN PREGNANCY PREVENTION PROGRAMS THESE SIGNIFICANT CUTS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO A NINE FOR TWENTY NINE PART SPENCE WHO HAVE BEEN SERVED. OF THE TWO OF RAM. THE INFORMATION IN IT CATION GRANT IS THE- GRANT NOT TO RELY ON FEDERAL FUNDING AND IS THEREFORE NOT RESTRICTED BY THE HOSTILE POLICY VIEW. OF THE CURRENT FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION ALTHOUGH THE PROGRAM WAS INITIALLY DESIGNED TO FOCUS ON PREGNANCY PREVENTION IT IS INVOLVED TO ADDRESS BOTH S. T. EYES AND HIV PREVENTION AS WELL. I ALONG WITH THE CALIFORNIA SEXUAL HEALTH EDUCATION ROUNDTABLE. POSE AN ALLOCATION OF THIRTY THREE AND A HALF MILLION AND STATE GENERAL FUNDS FOR THE INFORMATION AND EDUCATION PROGRAM GRANTS OPERATED BY THE MATERNAL CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH DIVISION OF THE SEAT. THIS WOULD BE A ONE TIME APPROPRIATION BUT WITH THE INTENTION OF THESE FUNDS TO BE DRAWN DOWN TO FUND TO GRANT CYCLES AT A MINIMUM INVESTING IN EDUCATION AT LEAST TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. GIVEN THAT SEXUAL HEALTH EDUCATION IS AN INVESTMENT IN EQUIPPING CALIFORNIA'S YOUTH WITH THE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS NEED TO MAKE HEALTHY DECISIONS ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIPS THEIR HEALTH AND THEIR FUTURE AND TO HELP PREVENT COSTLY PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM. SO DOES TI SEE IN A- WELL INTIMATE PART VIOLENCE ARGUE THAT A SYSTEM INCREASE AN STI IS AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE POTENTIAL COST SAVINGS WITHIN HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. TO FURTHER DISCUSS THIS THE IMPORTANCE OF RESTORING THIS FUNDING I'M HAPPY TO HAVE WITH ME HEATHER MYERS REGIONAL REGIONAL PROGRAM MANAGER FOR MARMONT T. PLANNED PARENTHOOD. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. I AND REGIONAL RENDON ESSENTIAL VALLEY- FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD WANTED THE LARGEST PLANNED PARENTHOOD IN THE COUNTRY IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN PP MA'AM REACHED EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS THROUGH EDUCATION INCLUDING. A STUDENTS RECEIVING AGE APPROPRIATE SEXUAL HAD HEALTH EDUCATION. WERE MANTE IS CURRENTLY PARTICIPATE IN AYE ANY PROGRAM WHICH ASSIST IN OUR EFFORTS TO SERVE YOUTH IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. MY PROVIDING THEM WITH THE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS NECESSARY TO MAKE HEALTHY DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR BODIES AND RELATIONSHIPS. I'M HERE TO SHARE SUCCESS STORY IN WHICH TO THE I. ANY PROGRAM WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HELP ADDRESS THE AND NEEDS OF UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY. AND COUNTY WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY GAPS EDUCATION PROVIDED TO STUDENTS ENROLLED IN SPECIAL EDUCATION CONSULT WITH THE FRESNO COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT SCHOOLS ADAPT EVIDENCEBASED INFORM CURRICULA TO FIT THE POPULATION EDUCATIONAL NEEDS. AND BE AWARDED ONE OF ONLY NINE I NEED GRANTS IN THE STATE TO IMPLEMENT THIS FILM. TO PUT MY COMMENTS IN PERSPECTIVE I'D LIKE TO SHARE A STORY WITH YOU. SEVERAL MONTHS AFTER OUR INSTRUCTION CONCLUDED AT ONE OF OUR SITES OUR TEAM IS IN FOR THAT ONE OF OUR STUDENTS. WHO IS TOUCHING PROBABLY BY APPEAR APPEAR THE DID NOT RECEIVE INSTRUCTION. HE JUST REPORTED THAT OUR STUDENT CLEARLY DEFINED THEIR BOUNDARIES. SOUGHT HELP USING STEPS WE TAUGHT DURING A CLASS ON CONSENT. THIS RESULTED IN REFERRAL FOR BOTH STUDENTS TO SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST FOR FURTHER SUPPORT. IT ALSO HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR ALL USED TO HAVE ACCESS TO SEXUAL HEALTH EDUCATION. AS YOU CAN SEE THE I. ANY GRANT IS A USEFUL TOOL FOR EDUCATION PROVIDER SUPPLEMENTING A NOTABLE AMOUNT OF EDUCATION WORK ITSELF BY COVERING A PORTION STAFF COSTS. PROVIDING EDUCATION IS MISSION DRIVEN WORK THEIR REQUIRES QUITE A BIT OF TRAINING HIRING TRAP AND OTHER HEAD. AND IS CRITICAL TO INVEST IN NINETY PROGRAM SO CAN SUPPLEMENT THE COST OF PROVIDING MORE EDUCATION PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WITH INCREMENTAL CREATE THIS TO THE GRANT AMOUNT IN MAKING GRANTS AVAILABLE THE I ANY PROGRAM. COULD SERVE A BROADER YOUTH WAS CURRENTLY BEING SIR. CREASE ENGAGEMENT BY HOLDING ADDITIONAL CURE HIM REUNITES AND PARENTS SUPPORT ACTIVITIES. INCREASE EFFICIENCY BY SENDING MORE EDUCATORS TO RURAL AREAS. SUPPORT PROVIDERS AND HIRING AN ADDITIONAL EDUCATOR WHO COULD RICHARD REDUCE THE GROUP SIZE ACCOMMODATE MULTIPLE MODES OF LEARNING AND PROVIDE MORE. INDIVIDUALIZED INSTRUCTION TO MEET SPECIFIC INDIVIDUAL PHYSICAL NEEDS. AS A LEADER IN HEALTH EDUCATION AND A PAST AND PRESENT BY ANY PARTICIPANT WE WOULD LIKE TO HELP ENSURE THAT EVEN MORE EDUCATION PROVIDERS ARE ABLE TO APPLY FOR THIS FUNDING OPPORTUNITY SO THAT I ANY FUNDED EDUCATION CAN BE MORE WIDELY AVAILABLE AND MORE PARTS OF THE STATE. ALL HERE TODAY TO THAT'S HOW THE STATE BUDGET CAN BEST SUPPORT PUBLIC HEALTH IN CALIFORNIA. IF THE STATE BUDGET IS A REFLECTION OF OUR VALUES AND IF WE TRULY VALUE THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF CALIFORNIA'S YOUTH WE WILL BEGIN RESTORING FUNDING TO THIS CRUCIAL PROGRAM. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU MA'AM. WHAT WE WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE NINETEEN.
