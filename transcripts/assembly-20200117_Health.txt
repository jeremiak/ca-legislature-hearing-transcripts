COMMITTEE HEARING THIS MORNING- WE HAVE ONE BILL BEFORE US WE WILL HAVE TIME LIMITS WHAT YOU'RE WITNESSES- AS THREE MINUTES PER SIDE EACH ADDITIONAL WITNESSES BE ASKED TO STATE THEIR NAME IN THE POSITION ON THE BILL ONLY THE THERE ARE BECAUSE IT IS ONLY ONE BILL- SO THERE ARE NO PROPOSED CONSENT BILLS- THE BILL IS AB FOUR NINETY FIVE- I'M GONNA SPEND SECRETARY TO TAKE THE ROLE STATUS QUIRK. WHAT HERE MAYES. AGUIAR-CURRY. BIGELOW RIGHT BONTA BURKE. RIO FLORA LOW MOAN. MCCARTY. NAZARIAN PRESIDENT RAMOS RODRIGUEZ SANTIAGO WALDRON. WE HAVE A QUORUM- LAST MISTER MURATSUCHI TO PRESENT HIS BILL. THEY ARE NOT THERE. NUMBER I AM HERE 2% EIGHTY FOUR NINETY FIVE THE TOXIC FREE COSMETICS ACT- I WANT TO THANK OF THE CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'VE HAD NUMEROUS CONVERSATIONS ON THIS BILL- OVER THE LAST A YEAR AND A HALF THIS IS A TWO YEAR BILL AND WE FIRST PRESENTED IT AS A INFORMATIONAL HEARING- IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY AND TOXIC MATERIALS COMMITTEE. WE HEARD THE- OPPONENTS ARGUMENTS AND WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE MATT. IN ALL CONCERNS THAT THEY HAVE REYES WITH US. THIS BILL WILL BAN COSMETICS IN CALIFORNIA THAT CONTAIN. ORIGINALLY TWENTY. AMENDED TO THIRTEEN AND WITH OUR AMENDMENTS- THAT WE ARE PROPOSING TO BE TAKEN IN THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE BUT ARE NOW AND FRIENDS AND THAT I HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS WE ARE DOWN TO ELEVEN. TOXIC CHEMICALS WELL KNOWN WELL ESTABLISHED BY THE SCIENCE TO CAUSE CANCER REPRODUCTIVE HARM. OR HORMONAL DESTRUCTION. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TOXIC CHEMICALS THAT ARE WELL KNOWN TO BE HARMFUL. ORIGINALLY WE HAD LEAD MERCURY ASBESTOS FORMALDEHYDE. BUT IN ORDER TO RAISE THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION. WE ARE PROPOSING. AND TO HAVE A LANGUAGE TO THE EFFECT OF TAKING OUT. AS BEST THIS AND LEAD IN ORDER TO MEET MY COMMITMENTS MADE OUR COMMITMENT TO MIRROR. THE EUROPEAN STANDARDS. SO ANY CONCERNS ABOUT ANY TRACE AMOUNTS THOSE ONLY APPLIED TO THE LEAD AND ASBESTOS. AND SO THAT IS NO LONGER AN ISSUE. THESE TOXIC CHEMICALS ARE SO WELL KNOWN THAT MOST PEOPLE'S REACTION TO THIS BILL IS WELL AREN'T THESE CHEMICALS ARE READY BAND. UNFORTUNATELY RECENT DISCOVERIES OF COSMETIC PRODUCTS ON STORE SHELVES IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. HIGHLIGHT THE FAILURE OF EXISTING CURRENT LAWS AND PROTECTING CONSUMERS. AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN THERE WAS A SPECIAL IS FOUND IN CHILDREN'S COSMETICS PRODUCTS BEING SOLD BY POPULAR RETAIL CHAINS LIKE CLAIRE IS AND JUSTICE. TO RETAIL POPULAR RETAIL CHAINS THAT TARGET GIRLS TEENS AND TWEENS. I KNOW ABOUT JUSTICE BECAUSE MY TEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER LOVES THAT STORE AND THAT WAS. YOU KNOW ONE OF MY- ORIGINAL MOTIVATIONS IN RECOGNIZING YOU KNOW WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE NEED TO PASS THIS BILL. IN ADDITION WE HAVE HAD NUMEROUS INCIDENTS. WELL DOCUMENTED OF BABY POWDER- CONTAINING ASBESTOS FACIAL CREAMS CONTAINING MERCURY. HAIR STRAIGHTENERS CONTAINING FORMALDEHYDE A RECENT STUDY BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH INDICATING THAT.HAIR STRAIGHTENERS AND FORMALDEHYDE HAS A STRONG- DRAMATICALLY INCREASES THE RISK OF BREAST CANCER ESPECIALLY AMONG AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN. SO THE SCIENCE IS CLEAR ON THE HARMFUL NATURE OF THESE CHEMICALS AND WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING IS TO ALIGN THE SCIENCE WITH THE EXTENSIVE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND STANDARDS THAT ARE READY EXIST AND THE EUROPEAN UNION. SO THAT CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS HAVE THE SAME RIGHT TO THE SAME PROTECTIONS THE SAME TOXIC FREE CUT COSMETICS AS THOSE ALREADY SOLD IN EUROPE. IF THEY COULD BE SOLD IN EUROPE. THEY CAN BE SOLD HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I'D LIKE TO TURN. THE PRESENTATION OF THIS BILL TO I HAVE TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. DR TONYA TAIWO. AN EPIDEMIOLOGIST FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS. FOLLOWED BY POLY MARSHALL A BREAST CANCER SURVIVOR. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN WOULD AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY ON BEHALF OF EIGHTY FOUR NINETY FIVE. AS USED AS THE RESIDENTS SAID MY NAME IS DOCTOR T&lt;c.cyan&gt; WILL I'M AN&lt;/c&gt; EPIDEMIOLOGIST ND CO DIRECTOR OF THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT COURT THE UC DAVIS ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER. I'M ALSO A MIDWIFE AT COMMUNICATOR HEALTH SET HEALTH CENTERS IN YOLO COUNTY MY RESEARCH FOCUSES ON THE EFFECT OF PRENATAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES ON CHILD DEVELOPMENT. AB FOR NINETY FIVE IS A COMMON SENSE BILL. THAT WOULD BAN ELEVEN OF THE MOST TOXIC CHEMICALS FROM COSMETIC PRODUCTS IN CALIFORNIA THESE ARE CHEMICALS WHERE THE SCIENCE IS UNDISPUTED AS TO THE HARM THAT CAUSED INCLUDING CANCER BIRTH DEFECTS. DAMAGE TO THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM AND HARM TO THE DEVELOPING BRAIN IN YOUNG CHILDREN IF I CAN JUST SPEAK TO A COUPLE OF THOSE CHEMICALS. MERCURY IS TOXIC TO THE DEVELOPING BRAIN AND KIDNEYS. PHTHALATES AND PARABENS ARE TWO CLASSES OF HORMONE DISRUPTING INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS UBIQUITOUS AND BEAUTY PRODUCTS VIRTUALLY ALL AMERICANS HAVE VALLEY'S AND PARABEN BUT HAVE LIGHTS AND THEIR BODIES. WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE AS THEY ARE THE PRIMARY CONSUMERS OF PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS WOMEN OF COLOR HAVE HIGHER LEVELS OF PRODUCT RELATED CHEMICALS IN THEIR BODIES BECAUSE THEY USE MORE TYPES OF PRODUCTS AND THE ONES MARKETED TO THEM. ARE OFTEN OFTEN CONTAIN MORE TOXIC CHEMICALS. BLACK WOMEN IN PARTICULAR SPEND MORE THAN FIVE BILLION DOLLARS ON BEAUTY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TWICE AS MUCH AS ANY OTHER AND THROUGH. WORK IS IN THE BEAUTY INDUSTRY ARE OFTEN REPRODUCTIVE AGE WOMEN FROM UNDER REPRESENTATIVE GROUPS AND THEY MAY BE MORE VULNERABLE TO THE ADVERSE HEALTH EFECTS BECAUSE THEY HANDLE THESE CHEMICALS ALL DAY LONG. THEY ALSO MAYBE FACING HIGHER CUMULATIVE EXPOSURES FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES IN THE HOME NEIGHBORHOOD AND WORKPLACE. THE COSMETIC INDUSTRY ARGUES THAT A LITTLE BIT OF A CARCINOGENIC CHEMICAL IN A CONSUMER PRODUCT ISN'T A COURT CAUSE FOR CONCERN BUT THIS IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE. SCIENCE TELLS US THAT FOR HORMONALLY. ACTIVE CHEMICALS EVEN SMALL EXPOSURES CAN CAUSE HARM FOR DEVELOPING FETUSES EXPOSURE TO EVEN SMALL AMOUNTS OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES DURING IMPORTANT TIMES OF DEVELOPMENT CAN HAVE IRREVERSIBLE IMPACT. AND PLACE THE CHILD ON THE PATH FOR LATER LIKE DISEASE AND THESE PROBLEMS CAN PERSIST ACROSS GENERATIONS. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BREAST CANCER. BLACK WOMEN WHO AND IT RECENT AND I. H. STUDY SHOWED THAT BLACK WOMEN WHO FREQUENTLY DYE THEIR HAIR FACE A 60% INCREASE RISK OF BREAST CANCER WHICH IS A SPECIALLY APPALLING BECAUSE BLACK WOMEN ALREADY FACE THE HIGHEST MORTALITY RATE. FROM BREAST CANCER OF ANY U. S. RACIAL GROUP. THE N. I. H. STUDY ALSO IMPLICATED HAIR STRAIGHTENERS AS A SCIENTIST. A MOTHER AND A BLACK WOMAN FACING THE STATISTICAL PROBABILITY. THAT MY RISK OF BREAST CANCER AND MY DAUGHTERS WOULD BE INCREASED SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE BEAUTY AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS THAT WE BUY. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT'S NOT OKAY. PLEASE VOTE YES ON EIGHTY FOUR NINETY FIVE. HI MY NAME IS PAULA MARSHALL AND I'M A BREAST CANCER SURVIVOR. AFTER MY DIAGNOSIS AT AGE FIFTY TWO I HAD THREE SURGERIES THREE MONTHS OF CHEMOTHERAPY AND FIVE WEEKS OF DAILY RADIATION TREATMENTS. I'M HERE TODAY TO TELL YOU WHY AB FOR NINETY FIVE IS SO IMPORTANT TO ME AND BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. ONE OUT OF EVERY EIGHT WOMEN IN THE U. S. IS DIET WILL BE DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER IN HER LIFETIME. AND FIFTY THOUSAND WOMEN WILL DIE FROM THE DISEASE EVERY YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES ALONE. TEN OUT OF THAT NOW ELEVEN CHEMICALS THAT WOULD BE BANNED BY A. B. FOR NINETY FIVE FROM BEAUTY AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS SOLD IN CALIFORNIA. ARE DIRECTLY LINKED TO BREAST CANCER TEN OUT OF THE ELEVEN. THIS IS NOT SORRY PASSING A BEFORE NINETY FIVE WILL REMOVE ONE MAJOR SOURCE OF WOMEN'S ONGOING EXPOSURE TO SOME OF THE MOST TOXIC SUBSTANCES ON EARTH. THIS IS NOT A HYPOTHETICAL ISSUE WOMEN LIKE ME LIVING WITH BREAST CANCER. LIVE IN DAILY FEAR OF REOCCURRENCE OF THIS DEVASTATING DISEASE AND WE FEAR FOR OUR CHILDREN WHO ARE CONSIDERED AT HIGH RISK OF BREAST CANCER SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY ARE OUR CHILDREN. COMPANIES SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE TO USE CHEMICALS WITH KNOWN LINKS TO BREAST CANCER IN BEAUTY AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS SOLD IN CALIFORNIA WHEN THEY'RE USING THE WHEN THEY ARE SELLING THE EXACT SAME PRODUCTS IN THE E. U. WITHOUT THESE CANCER CAUSING CHEMICALS. AB FOR NINETY FIVE WOULD PUT AN END TO THIS DOUBLE STANDARD. PLEASE PROTECT ME AND OTHER BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. PLEASE PROTECT OUR CHILDREN. PLEASE VOTE YES TO PASS THIS IMPORTANT BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN A WE ARE ALSO JOINED BY- THE JOINT AUTHOR OF A BEFORE NINETY FIVE SOMETHING OR WICKS. CHECK.

IS THERE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION IMMEDIATELY ON BEHALF OF THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS COUNCIL THAT THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY JOB- TESTIFYING N OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL I WANNA START OFF BY- GOING THROUGH THE REASONS THAT WE DO OPPOSE A BILL AND WHY WE DON'T OPPOSE A BILL I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO LEVEL SET- WE DO NOT OPPOSE THIS BILL BECAUSE ANY OF OUR MEMBER COMPANIES INTENTIONALLY ADD. ANY OF THESE ELEVEN THIRTEEN I'M SORRY INGREDIENTS INTO OUR PRODUCTS WE OPPOSE FUNDAMENTALLY BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE DICTATING CHEMICAL POLICY WHEN WE ALREADY HAVE GREEN CHEMISTRY IN PLACE WHICH IS A PROGRAM THAT COMPREHENSIVELY AND SCIENTIFICALLY LOOKS AT CHEMICALS AND CHEMICAL BANDS AND THEY LOOK AT ALTERNATIVES- IS A BETTER PROCESS IN FACT THERE WAS A BILL SPONSORED BY. SENATOR ALLEN THAT WOULD HAVE EXPEDITED THAT PROGRAM WE WENT NEUTRAL WE ARE FULLY BEHIND MAKING A PROGRAM THAT WORKS THE LEADING TO IDENTIFYING CHEMICALS OF CONCERN IN IDENTIFYING ALTERNATIVES TO THEM WORK BETTER AND I WANT TO SAY THAT FOR THE RECORD- WE TESTIFIED IN THE PREVIOUS POLICY COMMITTEE AND E. S. T. M. AND STATED OUR REASONS FOR OPPOSING A BEFORE NINETY FIVE LARGELY STEM FROM. THE LACK OF ALIGNMENT THAT THIS BILL HAS WITH THE E. U. COSMETIC REGULATIONS- YOU'LL JUST RECEIVE THESE AMENDMENTS THAT WE JUST RECEIVED ABOUT AN HOUR AGO FROM THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND- I HAVE TO SAY THAT I'M QUITE DISAPPOINTED IN THE PROCESS THAT IS TAKING PLACE OVER THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS NAMELY THAT. WE WALKED OUT OF THE STM COMMITTEE THREE DAYS AGO FEELING VERY GOOD ABOUT THE COMMITMENTS THAT WERE MADE AND JUST LESS THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS AGO WE HEARD FROM SEVERAL SOURCES NOT JUST ONE SEVERAL SOURCES THAT THEY DID NOT INTEND. ON COMMITTING FULLY TO THE AGREEMENT THAT WAS MADE IN THE STM COMMITTEE. AND AS YOU CAN IMAGINE. AS PART OF THE INTEGRITY OF THE LEGISLATIVE NEGOTIATION PROCESS- WE WERE VERY DISAPPOINTED IT. IN LEARNING THAT AND. AND STARTED TALKING TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS ABOUT LAYING OFF THE BILL AS A RESULT OF THAT BREACH OF THAT THAT AGREEMENT. WE RECEIVE THESE AMENDMENTS ABOUT AN HOUR AGO AND WE ARE FEVERISHLY HAVING OUR COMPANIES AND OUR LEGAL TEAMS LOOK AT THEM AND I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT THIS IS PROGRESS ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT THE AUTHOR AGREE TO ANY SEM COMMITTEE HOWEVER. THERE IS ONE SECTION THAT WE ARE STILL NOT SURE GETS IS TOO FULL ALIGNMENT WITH THE E. U. FULL ALIGNMENT WITH THE E. U. AS WHAT WE WERE PROMISED. ANY ANYTHING THAT CAN BE SOLD IN THE TWENTY EIGHT STATES IN THE E. U. THE AUTHOR AND THE CHAIR OF THE SEM COMMITTEE PROMISED US COULD BE SOLD IN CALIFORNIA AND WE NEED TO BE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN. IN PRINT IN BLACK AND WHITE. THAT THIS BILL GETS US FULLY ALIGNED WITH THE E. U. WE ARE NOT CERTAIN THAT SUBDIVISION BEAT DOES THAT. IN PART BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT WE CALL THE TRACE EXCEPTIONS. WHERE CONTAMINANTS I HAVE TIME. ALL A WRAP UP RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT SURE THAT SUBDIVISION BE GETS US THERE- WE CONTINUE TO COMMIT OURSELVES TO ALIGN OURSELVES FULLY WITH THE E. YOU SHOULD THE AUTHOR INTRODUCE A NEW BILL AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE OUT OF WRIGLEY ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE'RE OPPOSED TO THE BILL AS IN- IN PRINT WE HAVEN'T REALLY HAD TIME TO REVIEW THE LANGUAGE RECEIVED AN HOUR AGO REGARDING THE INTENT LANGUAGE WE HAVE HEARD FROM THE AUTHOR YOU'RE COMMITTED TO ALIGN ITH THE E. U. WE OBVIOUSLY SUPPORT- THAT COMMITMENT AND WILL LOOK FOR TO. CONTINUE ENGAGEMENT THANKS. THE COOKING YOURS ON BEHALF OF THE FRAGRANCE CREATORS ASSOCIATION- ECHO THE COMMENTS BEFORE ON JUST OUT APPRECIATE THE PROGRESS SO FAR BUT YES WE DO STILL NEED TO REVIEW. THANK YOU. CHAIRMAN PERCENT JUST LIKE WITH AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL- ALIGN MYSELF A COMMA SO THE CHAMBER AND NOT MISS CAN KNOWN AS- APPRECIATE THE WORK SO FAR THE AUTHOR IN THE AND SPONSORS. THANK YOU. Q. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS DON CAP KHIMIK YOU CAP CAN ASSOCIATES ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION. I SEEM TO DOES APPRECIATE THE GREAT PROGRESS THAT'S BEEN MADE A WE TOO. ARE WORKING WITH OUR MEMBER COMPANIES TO REVIEW OTHER PROPOSED AMENDMENTS WE RECEIVED I JUST THIS MORNING- ABBOTT DO BELIEVE IT TIED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND HOPE TO BE. ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR INFORMATION VERY QUICKLY THANK YOU. YOU ANYONE ELSE. NOT WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THIS CARILLO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION ON COMMITMENTS THAT YOU MADE IN THE PREVIOUS COMMITTEE AND HOW THOSE COMMITMENTS ARE NOW IMPLEMENTED IN YOUR NEW AMENDMENTS YES THANK YOU MISS CARILLO. YOU KNOW. I COMMITTED IN THE ENVIRONMENT SAFETY COMMITTEE THAT. WE WOULD WORK TO ALIGN. THE STANDARDS IN THIS BILL TO THE STANDARDS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION. I BELIEVE. WE HAVE- THE BILL AND THAT MIRRORS THE STANDARDS OF THE ENVIRONMENT OF A EUROPEAN UNION AT THIS POINT. AND IN FACT I WAS LOOKING FOR. THE REPRESENTED FROM THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS COUNCIL. TO IDENTIFY ANY SPECIFIC PROVISION THAT DOES NOT MAYOR THE- EUROPEAN UNION STANDARDS NOW FAIR ENOUGH- THESE AMENDMENTS WE SCRAMBLED TO GET THEM OUT. LATE YESTERDAY AFTERNOON. AND. INTO LAST NIGHT BECAUSE OF MY CONVERSATIONS WITH SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LATE YESTERDAY AFTERNOON INDICATING TO ME THAT THEY DID NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE AND VOTING ON A BILL WITHOUT THIS SPECIFIC LANGUAGE THEY WANTED KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE GONNA BE VOTING ON. FAIR ENOUGH WE SCRAMBLED IN AND GOT THAT LANGUAGE SO. YOU KNOW I FEEL. IN ALL MY HEART THAT I HAVE MET MY COMMITMENTS AND I TAKE ANY CHALLENGES TO MY INTEGRITY SERIOUSLY I BELIEVE IN ALL MY HEART THAT THIS. IS SOMETHING THAT IS ENTIRELY CONSISTENT WITH MY COMMITMENT TO PRESENT A BILL THAT MIRRORS THE STANDARDS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND IF THERE ARE ANY SPECIFIC PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL THAT DOES NOT. NEAR THE STANDARDS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION I ASK RIGHT NOW. YOU KNOW WHERE TO IDENTIFY THOSE MS. KIM. THE ANSWER. MS LEE IDENTIFIED SUBDIVISION BE. OF THE DRAFT LANGUAGE THAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU. AND THIS LANGUAGE IS IT ENTIRELY IN WELL IT BUT LET ME NOW TURN IT OFF IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR TO THIS IS A LITTLE WITH ENVIRONMENT WORKING GROUP WHO. WORKED ON THIS LANGUAGE. THANK YOU I WOULD JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THE LAND AND LANGUAGE IDENTIFIED IN SUBDIVISION AND- THEN- SUBDIVISION BE BE THERE IS ACTUALLY LANGUAGE THAT WAS DRAFTED BY THE STM COMMITTEES STAFF AND WAS PROPOSED IN THE STM COMMITTEE. ANALYSIS AND THAT IS WHAT'S ADOPTED THE CHANGES THERE ARE TWO TO CONFORM WITH THE AMENDMENTS EVERY MOVING- PARAGRAPHS ONE AND TWO WHICH INCLUDE AS BEST US AND LEAD FROM THE BILL. THOSE ARE THE ONLY CHANGES WE HAVE MADE TO THAT LANGUAGE THAT THE COMMITTEE DRAFTED. AND SO WE DO BELIEVE AND WE HAVE CONTINUED TO MAINTAIN THAT THESE AMENDMENTS CONFORM- WITH THE E. U. STANDARD WE STRIPPED EVERYTHING OUT OF THE BILL. THAT COULD- BE PERCEIVED AS NOT CONFORMING WITH THAT STANDARD. AT THIS TIME AND WE- AGAIN TO REITERATE THE AUTHORS STATEMENTS WE ARE COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT THAT IS WHAT WE PERCEIVE WE CONFORM WITH MOVING FORWARD. THROUGH THE THROUGH THIS PROCESS THANK YOU. AND IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR AND FURTHER ANSWERING A MYSTERY AS QUESTION. YOU KNOW. IT GIVES US NO PLEASURE TO TAKE OUT THE PROTECTIONS FOR. COSMETICS THAT- CONTAIN LEAD AND ASBESTOS YOU KNOW THOSE. ACCORDING TO MISTER MCCARTY AND SOME OTHERS THAT I SPOKE WITH IN- ON THE COMMITTEE ARE ARGUABLY THE BIGGEST CONCERNS IN TERMS OF PUBLIC HEALTH. BUT WE MADE THE HARD DECISION TO TAKE OUT PERHAPS THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT CHEMICALS IN ORDER TO DEMONSTRATE OUR GOOD FAITH TO COMPLY WITH THE COMMITMENT THAT WE MADE TO MIRROR THE E. U.'S STANDARDS. THERE IS AMBIGUITY AS TO THE E. U. STANDARDS AS IT RELATES TO ASBESTOS AND LEAD FOR EXAMPLE A SPOUSE'S- THERE ARE DIFFERENT STANDARDS THEY'RE DIFFERENT FORSMAN STANDARDS DEPENDING ON THE MEMBER COUNTRIES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION. AND WE COULD NOT COME UP WITH THE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE TO MEET- YOU NOTED THAT DEFINE ONE STANDARD FOR AS BASSES AND SAID THAT IS THE REASON WHY WE TOOK IT OUT. THAT BUT I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THAT IS. YOU KNOW FURTHER EMONSTRATION THAT'S ABOUT AS GOOD AS DEMONSTRATION AS AS I CAN GIVE OF OUR GOOD FAITH COMMITMENT TO. MEET THE STANDARDS OUTLINED THIS BILL WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION BY TAKING OUT TO A PERHAPS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHEMICALS THAT WE ARE SEAT ORIGINALLY SEEKING TO ADDRESS. OTHER OTHER QUESTIONS COMES. MISTER RODRIGUEZ. YEAH I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THIS AS WELL BECAUSE OVERSEE THAT THE LANGUAGE IS FAIRLY NEW WE HAVEN'T EVEN AT TWENTY FOUR HOURS TO REALLY GO IN AND LOOK AND DETAIL BUT THE COMMITTEE PRIOR WAS A TUESDAY OR WEDNESDAY TUESDAY TO THURSDAY SO I THINK WHAT WAS CAUSING ALL THE PROBLEMS IS BECAUSE EVERYTHING WAS LIKE YOU SAID SCRAMBLED LATE LAST NIGHT TO MAKE SOME CHANGES BECAUSE THERE WERE SOME ISSUES WITH THE BILL- I THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE SOONER I THINK. THAT WE WOULD HAVE AT LEAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS TO REALLY FULLY THAT THE LANGUAGE IN. THE TENT I WAS ROOTING FOR SO I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM AS WELL. I KIND OF FEEL THAT IF YOU'RE SHOULD HAVE. BEEN REALLY COMMITTED AFTER THAT COMMITTEE HEARING TO. START RODERICK GREEN THAT LANGUAGE THAT WE WOULD HAVE A DAY OR TWO RIGHT. NOW WE'RE LIKE UP AGAINST THE WALL. SO I'M STILL TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AS WELL SOME. AYE PREACHER YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IT AND I KNOW YOU'VE- DONE A LOT OF SIGNIFICANT CHANGES I THINK. BECAUSE IT'S SO NEW WE ONLY HAVE OURS BASICALLY TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING- THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING ON THIS BILL. AND YOU KNOW I AGREE WITH THE GOAL OF THE BILL. AND I. AGREE THAT WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO CHEMICALS OR PRODUCTS THE LOWER SAFETY STANDARDS- THAN THOSE OF THE E. U. I'M FRUSTRATED FOR YOU BECAUSE I WISH THIS WOULD HAVE COME QUICKER AND WE'RE SCRAMBLING AS YOU CAN SEE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE LANGUAGE MEANS AND TRYING TO TALK TO EVERYONE UP HERE ON THE COUNT. ON THE DíAS. BUT YOU IN YOUR SPONSORS OF EXPRESS THAT IT'S DIFFICULT TO WRITE PARITY LANGUAGE ON THIS ONE- I'LL BE THE FIRST TO HELP YOU. LATER ON NO ONE I THINK WE SHOULD WE LOOK THIS- AND AT THIS POINT I'M GOING TO STAFF THE BILL TODAY IF IT COMES BACK TO THE FLOOR PASSES COMMITTEE. I'M HOPEFULLY THE CHANGES THAT WE CAN REALLY SPEND SOME TIME ON IT BUT THIS IS COME SO QUICKLY- AND YOU DID A GREAT JOB YOU GOT THIS TO ME THIS MORNING I ASKED YOU. NO LATER THAN THIS MORNING- BUT I'M FINDING THAT THERE'S- SOME DISCREPANCIES AND SOME OTHER ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THAT. I NEED TO DATE WITH MY STAFF AS WELL SO WITHOUT APPEALING OFFICE TODAY. ACTUALLY IT WAS THE MAN FOR SOME SORRY MY BAD. THANK YOU- AND I ACTUALLY WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I KNOW THAT LAST YEAR THERE WERE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS AND AT THE TIME THE COMMITTEE DIDN'T YOU KNOW OR COMMITTEE MEMBERS ALSO DIDN'T FEEL PREPARED- AND TO VOTE ON A AND THE BILL HAS CHANGED TO SOME EXTENT. I THINK YOU KNOW FOR ME IT'S IMPORTANT THAT CONSUMERS HAVE TRUST IN ALL PRODUCTS I DID I KNOW AND YOU KNOW I DID SOME WORK RELATED TO LEAD- PREVENTION- AND PRIOR TO GETTING TO THE ASSEMBLY AND IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THERE WERE A NUMBER OF LEADS- FOCUS BILLS. THAT THE LEGISLATURE MOVE FORWARD IN IN TERMS OF HEALTH AND SAFETY SO ALL TO SAY THAT THE PRODUCTS THAT ARE OUT THERE WHETHER IT'S IN PAINTING IN MAKE UP IN A HOME ANYTHING THEY THEY HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE ON THE HEALTH OF A HUMAN- AND I THINK THAT. IT'S SO IT'S GREAT TO HEAR THAT TH PRODUCTS ARE ARE NOT USING THAT THAT THE THAN THOSE MANUFACTURING PRODUCTS ARE COMMITTED TO NOT HAVING THOSE PRODUCTS. ON IN. DOES ELEMENT IN THE PRODUCTS- AND I THINK THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT IT SOUNDS NOW THAT THIS IS- A MATTER OF PROCESS IT'S A MATTER. OF WHAT WE CAN YOU KNOW DO TO CLARIFY. THIS PARTICULAR LANGUAGE THAT'S BEING I THINK THAT MEMBERS HAVE TALKED ABOUT. BUT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS- AND I'LL BE SUPPORTING IT BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE IT'S AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION AND I THINK THAT THIS IS SOMETHING- IT'S IN THE EARLY. SPACES THERE IS STILL MULTIPLE COMMITTEES THAT THIS THE BILL HAS TO GO TO SO I THINK THAT WHAT'S BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A PROBLEM. HAS A PATHWAY FOR A SOLUTION- AND I THINK THAT IN THE END- I WANT THE- CONSUMER TO FEEL THAT THEY CAN TRUST. THE PRODUCTS THAT THEY USE- AND THAT'S IN MAKE UP AND ANYTHING ELSE AND SO- I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT. I KNOW THAT TO AND THERE'S YOU KNOW LOTS OF DISCUSSION ABOUT. THE PROCESS ITSELF BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT IF. AS THIS MOVES FORWARD- THAT THERE COULD ALSO BE A WAY TO ADD. A LINE- SOME OF THE CONCERNS I IT IN A WAY THAT'S- POSITIVE TOWARDS THE BILL SO THANK YOU. THE CHRISTMAS BURKE. I'LL BE QUICK I WANNA LINE MY COMMENTS WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC I KNOW IT IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT I KNOW IT'S VERY VERY COMPLEX RIGHT FOR ME I ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THE ISSUE AS- HOWEVER IT HOWEVER YOU DO THAT AND CLARIFYING SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN LEFT. UNCLEAR HOWEVER I HAVE NOT HAD THE TIME AND NIGHT WE HAVE BEEN RUNNING IN AND OUT TRYING TO MAKE SURE WE CAN UNDERSTAND WITH COMMITTEE STAFF AND OUR OWN STAFF BUT I DON'T THINK I HAVE MY- ARMS WRAPPED AROUND THIS WELL ENOUGH YET SO FOR ME I'M GONNA LAY OFF RIGHT NOW BUT IF IT. COMES DOWN TO THE FLOOR I LOOK FOR TO HOPEFULLY IT BEING CLEANED UP TO A PLACE WHERE WE CAN ALL SPORTING. MR MCCARTY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I WANT TO TALK A BIT ABOUT THE- THE POLICY BUT ALSO THE PROCESS SO YOU KNOW I WASN'T ON ESPN COMEDIAN MEASURE ANYBODY ELSE HE WAS BUT MY UNDERSTANDING AND I FEEL LIKE WALKING INTO THIS MOVIE WHEN IT'S HALFWAY. IS THAT THERE WAS A COMMITMENT TO HAVE YOU WORK ON- SENSE ENERGY WITH THE LANGUAGE FOR THE E. U. AND YOU'RE GONNA DO THAT THROUGH THE APPROPRIATIONS. PROCESS DOWN THE ROAD NOT NECESSARILY BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. AND SO THE REASON THAT YOU RUSHED TO DO THESE NAMES TODAY IS BECAUSE THERE WAS. BASICALLY NOT COVER THAT IT WAS. THAT WE HAVE BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE BUT WHAT WHAT I'M I'M CONFUSED WHAT DID YOU ACTUALLY COMMIT TO DOING AND WHAT WAS THE TIME PERIOD WAS IT YOU'RE GONNA TRY TO. APPS LANGUAGE ON THIS PIECE BEFORE TODAY'S HEARING. YES SO THANK YOU MISTER MCCARTY SO- IN THE ENVIRONMENT SAFETY COMMITTEE ON TUESDAY. I WAS ABLE TO GET COURTESY VOTES FROM MY COLLEAGUES TO MOVE THE BILL FORD FOR THE SAKE OF- HAVING CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION ON THIS IMPORTANT CONSUMER PROTECTION ON THE COMMITMENT THAT WE A LINE- THE STANDARDS IN THIS BILL WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION. WE WERE ORIGINALLY HOPING TO. BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE CONTINUE THE WORK WITH THE S. HIM STAFF- AS WELL AS THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE STAFF TO COME UP WITH LANGUAGE- IT TOO BUT. SPECIFICALLY DEFINE THE EUROPEAN THE APPLICA EUROPEAN STANDARDS IN ORDER TO MEET OUR COMMITMENT TO ALIGN OURSELVES WITH THE EUROPEAN- THE STANDARDS. HOWEVER WHEN I STARTED HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS SAYING THAT WHAT WE DON'T WANT YOU KNOW JUST A COMMITMENT WE WANT TO SPECIFIC LANGUAGE THAT- PROMPTED US- AND RECORD AS TO. TO HAVE TO SCRAMBLE TO MAKE SOME HARD DECISIONS AND- SO WHAT WE DID WHAT WE DID DECIDE AND WHAT IS BEFORE YOU RIGHT NOW. IS YOU KNOW THE OF THE REMAINING CHEMICALS THOSE CHEMICALS- ARE. BANNED IN THE U. E. U. AND OUR BILL IS ENTIRELY ALIGNED WITH THE E. U. BUT BECAUSE THERE ARE COMPLEXITIES WITH THE E. U. STANDARDS AS AS TO LEAD IN THIS BEST THIS. IN ORDER TO MEET OUR COMMITMENT THAT'S WHY WE ENTIRELY TOOK THOSE TWO CHEMICALS OUT OF THE BILL. SO THAT- IT DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IN TERMS OF THE YEAH I THINK IT IT IT PUTS YOU IN A VERY DIFFICULT POSITION BECAUSE THERE'S JUST THREE DAYS AGO. AND YOU YOU DIDN'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE CAME TO DO IT BEFORE TODAY BUT WORKING WITH THE PARTIES BEFORE AS WE MOVE ALONG OTHERS SAY THAT YOU WANTED TO GET THE BOOKS TODAY SO YOU TRY TO. RUSH IN THERE AND THAT'S WHY IT SEEMS THAT THERE'S NOT TIME. TO LOOK AT THAT SO I HAVE ANOTHER OPINION ON THAT BUT THAT'S OKAY AS FAR AS THE MERITS OF THIS- YOU KNOW OVERALL WHEN YOU INTEREST AS A YEAR AGO I THOUGHT OF THAT RISK% REWARD IS THERE MORE REWARD TO. CONSUMERS AND ESPECIALLY YOUNG PEOPLE WHICH I'LL TALK ABOUT A SECOND. OR MORE RESTED THIS INDUSTRY THAT I WOULD CRATER AND- YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA HAS STEPPED UP ABOVE. THE FDA AND OTHER ISSUES AND SO I THINK THIS IS ONE WHERE CALIFORNIA HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD AND IT WAS ESPECIALLY. DISTURBING LIKE YOU MENTIONED TO SEEING THE IMPACT OF SOME OF THESE PRODUCTS. ON KIDS I HAVE TWEENS JUST LIKE YOU. AND THEY'RE YOU KNOW DYING TO GO THE NEXT STEP BEYOND SPEAKING. LIP GLOSS HERE AND THERE. AND THE THAT THAT'S THE BEST DOSE AND LET IN THOSE PRODUCTS IS VERY DISTURBING. AND I DON'T KNOW HOW WE CAN SAY THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO STEP UP THIS CALIFORNIA TO FURTHER- PROTECT OUR CONSUMERS AND OUR KIDS IN. AN INDUSTRY THAT YOU KNOW I THINK HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO GO ABOVE AND BEYOND JUST TRYING NOT TO INCLUDE THESE DANGERS ELEMENTS. IN COSMETIC PRODUCTS. AND THE THING THAT WE HEARD ABOUT FROM THAT ARE THE TWO ELEMENTS THAT YOU TOOK OUT RIGHT. BEST US AND LET. SO HOW. AND IT MAY NAY BE STRONG ENOUGH IN THE FIRST PLACE TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES SO. HOW WOULD HOW WOULD YOU. AGAIN SELL US THAT. YOU'RE BEING- RESPONSIVE TO. ADMIT THAT TO AT HEARING TO THE EASE STANDARDS WITH THOSE TWO PIECES. THE STATUS OF THAT. AND THAT- THE OVERALL. IT TO INCREASE THE SPEED OF YOUR TRYING TO ACHIEVE GOING FOR. SO AGAIN WE TOOK OUT. THE SPACES AND LEAD BECAUSE THOSE WITH IT THE TWO AND THE ONLY TWO CHEMICALS THAT WE HEARD- FROM IS LEE THAT WERE. RAISING CONCERNS WITH FEAR OPPOSITION IN TERMS OF- DEFINING AND ALIGNING WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION STANDARDS. BUT BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITIES IN DEFINING THE EUROPEAN STANDARDS- ASKED TO ONLY THOSE TWO CHEMICALS. YOU KNOW RATHER THAN. TRYING TO- TO COME UP OF LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ADDRESS THE COMPLEX COMPLICATED EUROPEAN UNION STANDARDS- WE AT MEAN IN ORDER TO. ATTEMPT TO MOVE THE BILL OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE WE DECIDED TO DROP THOSE THOSE TWO CHEMICALS ENTIRELY AS TO THE REMAINING ELEVEN CHEMICALS WE HAVE NOT HEARD ANY CONCERNS. UP UNTIL NOW- AS TO THOSE ELEVEN CHEMICALS I BELIEVE THAT THOSE ELEVEN CHEMICALS ARE ENTIRELY ALIGNED WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION STANDARDS MS LEE INDICATED AND MY MEETING WITH HER THAT THAT- THEY ARE LOOKING FOR A GLOBAL STANDARD. SO THAT WHAT IS SOLD IN EUROPE CAN BE SOLD IN CALIFORNIA SO THAT YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS CAN ENJOY THE SAME- MY PERSPECTIVES LIKE A CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS CAN ENJOY THE SAME PER. CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AS THOSE A READY BEING ENJOYED IN THE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION. SO EVEN AS YOUR AIM LAW HOW WOULD YOU PROTECT CONSUMERS AGAINST. EXPOSURE AND PRODUCTS FROM LEAD IN THIS BEST. SO THERE ARE CURRENT LAWS FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS THAT- THAT TO- YOU KNOW ATTEMPT TO REGULATE TOXIC CHEMICALS AND COSMETICS BUT YOU KNOW AS WE'VE SEEN AS A FROM THE RECENT EXAMPLES OF PRODUCTS BEING SOLD TO CALIFORNIA ANOTHER CONSUMERS IN THE COUNTRY THOSE LAWS YOU KNOW OUR- ARE ARE ARE BEING INADEQUATELY ENFORCED. FUNDAMENTALLY WHERE WHERE WE'RE DEALING WITH THE SITUATION WHERE THE FTA AND- THE DEPARTMENT THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH LACKS GROSSLY LACKS THE NECESSARY RESOURCES TO- ADEQUATELY PROTECT CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS- MISLEAD. ARE MENTIONED THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM THE CHAIR OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY COMMITTEE AND ONE OF HIS MORE MEMORABLE LINES- STATED THAT- IN IN TERMS OF THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM. THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL IS IN HIS WORDS CONSTIPATED. YOU KNOW THEY THEY THEY THEY THEY HAVE ONLY SUCCEEDED AND- REGULATING- CHEMICALS THREE CHEMICAL COMBINATIONS AND THEIR ELEVEN YEARS OF EXISTENCE IN THE MEANTIME WE ARE SEEING A SPAZ TO THIS- MERCURY AND FACIAL CREAMS FORMALDEHYDE AND HAIR STRAIGHTENERS ME CLEARLY THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS NOT WORKING SO IT IN ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION IN MISTER MCCARTY WE DO HAVE LAWS- THAT THAT ATTEMPT TO. TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS BUT AS WE'VE SEEN- WITH THE DISCOVERY OF TOXIC CHEMICALS- BEING SOLD TO CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS CURRENT LAWS ARE INADEQUATE AND THAT'S WHY EIGHTY FOUR NINETY FIVE. IS NECESSARY. THANK YOU MISTER FOR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- SO RUN JUST CURIOUS SO CLEARLY THERE'S AN APPETITE TO VOTE ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS I CLEARLY INDUSTRY IS READY AND WILLING TO NEGOTIATE ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES SO WHY THE RUSH BY WIRE WE RUN THIS THROUGH AT AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR CLEARLY THERE IS A PATH WHEN THERE'S TIME SO I'M JUST CURIOUS WHY THE RUSH. OKAY WELL. I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION- I MISSED FLORA YOU KNOW FIRST OF ALL THIS AND I WANT TO REMIND EVERYONE THIS IS A TO YOUR BILL- AND SO WE HAVE BEEN HAVING GO- CONVERSATIONS- ON THIS FOR THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF. BUT AS AS WE ALL KNOW WE WEAR FOR A FACING THE- HOUSE OF ORIGIN DEADLINE FOR TO YOUR BILLS- AND SO THAT IS OUR OUR CURRENT SITUATION- YOU KNOW WE ARE HOPING. THAT IS OFTEN DONE WITH BILLS- IN IN OUR- HOUSE THAT- THAT WITH THE DEMONSTRATION OF GOOD FAITH AND MEETING THE COMMITMENTS THAT WE CAN. MOVE THE BILL FORWARD- THAT IS FOR UP TO THIS COMMITTEE SO I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S AWESOME. I WAS CURIOUS WHY IN A YEAR AND A HALF WE HAVE HAD THESE AMENDMENTS. IF THIS IS THE VOTE OF THE MEMBERS THAT WE NEEDED TO GET THE VOTES OUT OF COMMITTEE THEN WHY ARE WE THERE AND I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR THE OPPOSITION. I'M KIND OF THEIR PERSPECTIVE ON WHY WHY WOULD YOU I'M IN THIS THING THROUGH WHAT'S WHAT'S GOINGON OUT THERE THAT WE'RE NOT SEEING. THAT THIS IN A YEAR AND A HALF AGO SHE HAITIANS WERE DOWN TO THIS FINAL COMMITTEE HEARING. TO MOVE THIS PARTICULAR BILL. WELL I. PERHAPS I CAN TURN OVER TO MISLEAD. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SOME WOMEN FLORA- WE HAD OUR FIRST CONVERSATION WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL IN DECEMBER AND RECEIVED- AN INITIAL LIST OF THE THIRTEEN CHEMICALS THAT YOU SEE HERE ON FOUR EIGHTY FIVE AND FRANKLY WE TOOK BACK BACK TO OUR MEMBER COMPANIES AND THEY SAID- THAT. THAT'S A MAJOR IMPROVEMENT OVER THE ORIGINAL BILL AND PRINT. AND THEN WE ASK FOR THE REST OF THE BILL AND SIX DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS WE WERE GIVEN THE REST OF THE BILL WHICH BEFORE IT YES TM COMMITTEE HAD HUGE BACK DOORS FOR DPH TO ADD ADDITIONAL CHEMICALS THAT WILL. WITH NO SCIENTIFIC REVIEW NO RISK ASSESSMENTS AND OBVIOUSLY THAT WAS A HUGE BECAUSE OF CONCERNS. AND SO WE MADE THE APPEAL ANY SEM COMMITTEE TO FULLY ALIGNED THIS WITH. YOU AND- WE THOUGHT THAT WE HAD THAT AGREEMENT UNTIL. TWENTY FOUR HOURS AGO AND I'M NOT. PLACING THIS ON THE AUTHOR SO- I HOPE THIS IMAGE EACH YEAR NOT. I'M NOT QUESTIONING YOUR INTEGRITY AT ALL- BUT- FOLKS THAT ARE WORKING ON YOUR BILL. ALLUDED TO THE FACT THAT THEY CAN NOT. MADE IN THE S. HIM TO FULLY ALIGNED THIS WITH THE E. U. WHICH OBVIOUSLY AT THIS POLICY JUNCTURE. CAUSES A SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THIS AND I WOULD JUST WHAT EVERY STATE MY COMMITMENT AND THE COMMITMENT OF MY ENTIRE COALITION. WE ARE COMMITTED TO THE SPIRIT OF THIS BILL WE'RE COMMITTED TO FULLY ALIGNING WITH THE E. U. AND WE COMMIT. IF WHATEVER THE COMMITTEE DECIDES TO DO TODAY WE COMMIT TO GOING BACK TO THE TABLE TO FULLY ALIGN THIS WITH THE E. U. AS RESEARCH I MEAN AS A FATHER OF TWO LITTLE GIRLS I ACTUALLY WANT TO VOTE ON A BILL LIKE THIS. IDEA I MEAN THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION HOUSE I APPRECIATE YOU BRING ABOARD I AM I JUST BE LAYING OFF OF THIS TODAY. AND LOOK FORWARD TO DOING SOMETHING AND FUTURE. THANK YOU. WALDRON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I UNDERSTAND THAT- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION YOU KNOW UPON THIS BILL FROM BOTH SIDES TRYING TO GET TO PROGRESS TOWARDS THE SOLUTION THAT CAN BE AGREED UPON I APPLAUD BOTH SIDES FOR WORKING TOGETHER ON THIS- YOU KNOW. AS SOMEONE WHO- IS A HUGE SUPPORTER OF NATURAL PRODUCTS AND YOU KNOW NOBODY WANTS TO SEE THE CHEMICALS ESPECIALLY THE CHEMICALS ON THE LIST IN THESE PRODUCTS THAT WE'RE PUTTING ON OUR SKIN INTERFACE- SO. EVEN ONE OF THE OTHER ISSUES THAT I ALWAYS THINK ABOUT IS THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW I LOOK AT THINGS LIKE THE FORMALDEHYDE AND HAIR STRAIGHTENERS AND- A FEW YEARS AGO I HAD LOOKED INTO THAT AND THERE IS A FROM ALL THE HYPE FREE OPTION BUT IT COSTS OVER A HUNDRED DOLLARS MORE THAN THE ONE THAT HAS THE FORMALDEHYDE IN IT. SO YOU LOOK AT MAKE UP ON THE COUNTER AND THE LOWER COSTS MAKE UPS TEND TO HAVE MORE THAN ARGUABLY THERE SOME SUBSTITUTES BUT THE TEN HAVE MORE OF THE CHEMICALS IN THEM THAN THE ONES YOU COULD PAY MORE FOR A GOLDEN NORDSTROM AND GET THE HIGH END PRODUCTS THAT MAYBE DON'T HAVE SOME OF THOSE OR YOU CAN PICK AND CHOOSE THEM- YOU KNOW BUT IT'S REALLY A SOCIO ECONOMIC THING TOO WE LOOKING AT DISADVANTAGED WOMEN AND YOU KNOW COMMUNITIES THAT. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN HAVE SAFE PRODUCTS FOR EVERYBODY ACROSS THE SOCIO ECONOMIC- FRAMEWORK SO. IT'S AN ISSUE THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT I THINKWE ALL AGREE THAT IT IS IMPORTANT. SO THE AMENDMENTS THE AUTHOR PLANS TO TAKE AN APPROACH. TO ADDRESS MANY OF THE REMAINING CONCERNS THERE'S OTHER ISSUES THAT WE'RE HEARING FROM THE OPPOSITION. BUT YOU KNOW ONCE AGAIN BECAUSE OF THESE DEADLINES IT'S KIND OF BEING PUSHED- SO I'M GOING TO LAY OFF THE BILL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THESE AMENDMENTS ACTUALLY IMPRINT. AND HAVE SUFFICIENT TIME TO ANALYZE SOME. THERE'S ALSO TIME TO HAVE A NEW BILL THAT CAN COME OUT AND CONTINUE ON AND I THINK THAT MIGHT BE THE CLEANEST WAY TO DO IT IN THIS YOU KNOW BECAUSE I THINK IT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE DO NEED TO ADDRESS AND CONTINUE TO WORK FOR SO- I HOPE TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT A BILL WHEN IT COMES YOU KNOW TO US EITHER ON THE FLOOR MAYBE BACK AS A NEW BILL- THAT IS CLEANER AND IN A LINE WITH THE E. U. AND- THAT DEALS WITH SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND CAN HELP DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AS WELL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MISTER IS AREA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IS THERE A MOTION TO MOVE THE. GOD LIKE TO MAKE THE MOTION FIRST. SECOND OF ALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SECOND OF ALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR WORK. ASSEMBLY MEMBER- I'VE WORKED ON NUMEROUS TO YOUR BILLS- I'VE WORKED ON. NUMEROUS MULTI YOUR BILLS- AND IT'S INTERESTING HOW SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS COME BACK. AND PROCESS BECOMES THE ENEMY OF SOMETHING GOODTHAT'S BEING ATTEMPTED TO MOVE FORWARD- MISLI I DO APPRECIATE YOU TAKING BACK SOME OF YOUR COMMENTS FROM THE- FROM THE ASSEMBLY AUTHOR. HE DIDN'T APPRECIATE THE INITIAL OPENING STATEMENTS BECAUSE FOR AS- MANY YEARS AS I'VE WORKED WITH THE AUTHOR SINCE I'VE BEEN FIRST ELECTED- HE'S SHOWN NOTHING BUT GREAT INTEGRITY. AND I DON'T APPRECIATE ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES. BEING SPOKEN OF IN A WAY WHERE- I KNEW HIS TRUE INTENTION AND I KNOW WHY HE'S TRYING TO DO THIS- I CAME HERE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY. SO I PLAN ON VOTING FOR IT. DISAPPOINTED WITH WHERE THE CONVERSATION HAS BEEN GOING. KIND OF REMINDS ME OF THE CIGARETTE BILLS THE HOST OF CIGARETTE TOBACCO BILLS THAT WE WERE WORKING ON SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND- THEY WERE ALL HELD SO WE NEEDED A SPECIAL SESSION TO ACTUALLY MOVING FORWARD. AND WE GOT IT DONE THAT WAY. I HAVE EVERY FAITH IN THE AUTHOR'S WORDS WHEN HE SAYS THAT HE'S GOING TO BE WORKING ON THIS BILL. AND THREE DAYS IS JUST NOT ENOUGH TIME TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES IN. THE. PRECISION THAT NEEDS TO GO NGUYEN TO SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BECOME LAW. SO FOR THE BENEFIT OF- THE TRUST I HAVE IN WHAT HE'S SAYING AS WELL AS MY COLLEAGUES- IN WANTING TO SEE SOMETHING. UP MOVE FORWARD THAT'S GOING TO BE A BENEFIT FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA AND PROBABLY LEAD THE WAY IN THE NATION. I ACTUALLY WANT TO SEE THIS BILL MOVE FORWARD AND WE HAVE AND THEN GIVE THE TIME NEEDS NECESSARY. TO WORK ON THE BILL. AND IF IT DOESN'T MEET THE COMMITMENT STANDARDS THAT THE AUTHOR HAD. MADE. THEN WE HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO NOT VOTE FOR IT ON THE FLOOR. BUT THIS IS I DON'T LIKE SEEING THE PROCESS BE USED TO SLOW DOWN. SOMETHING THAT'S VERY MEANINGFUL SO. I WILL BE VOTING ON THIS BILL I DO HOPE IT COMES UP FOR A VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE SEE OTHER COMMENTS THE SCRIPT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR ADDRESSING A LOT OF THE CONCERNS- THAT THE MEMBERS HAVE AD. WITH THE PROCESS I THINK IN INSIDE CONVERSATIONS. ANNOUNCER HARD AND TAKE TIME. THIS IS A VERY COMPLICATED BILL WE'RE TRYING TO GET ONE STATE OUR STATE TO LEAD THE WAY ACROSS THE NATION WHEN IT COMES TO CHEMICALS AND COSMETICS. THAT LEAD TO A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT HEALTH ISSUES. I AM VERY HAPPY AND PLEASED TO HEAR THAT THE OPPOSITION IS IN AGREEMENT AND WANTS TO GET TO A BETTER PLACE WHEN IT COMES TO CAUSE MEDICS. I THINK THE FRUSTRATION IS THAT. THIS IS A HUGELY IMPORTANT BILL AND THERE HASN'T BEEN A LOT OF TIME TO REVIEW AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE WORKING VERY HARD AND EVEN IN THE THREE DAYS SINCE THE PREVIOUS COMMITTEE. TO GET TO THE AMENDMENTS AND TO GET TO THE LANGUAGE THAT WE WANTED TO SEE IS COMMENDABLE ON YOUR END- I SIT ON APPROPRIATIONS SO I WILL HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THIS BILL- I THINK THAT WE WANT TO GET TO A PLACE IN WHICH POLICY DECISIONS AND LANGUAGE ARE MADE AND POLICY COMMITTEES AND NOT ENOUGH FISCAL COMMITTEE. AND I THINK THAT'S I THINK WHAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM A LOT OF OUR COLLEAGUES- I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL IN GOOD FAITH. WITH YOU. BUT I REALLY DO HOPE THAT YOU GET TO A PLACE WITH THE OPPOSITION- INTO ACTUALLY GETTING CALIFORNIA AND TO EAT YOU STANDARDS IF THAT IS THE INTENT- BUT I THINK MOVING FORWARD. THIS IS A REAL GOOD OPPORTUNITY I THINK FOR ALL OF US TO THINK ABOUT PROCESS DEADLINES. I ALSO HAVE TO YOUR BILLS THAT I HAVE DECIDED TO HOLD OFF AND ACTUALLY RE INTRODUCE. BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO. I WANT TO GET MY COLLEAGUES THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW. AND TO ACTUALLY HAVE A THOUGHTFUL CONVERSATION. THINGS THAT ARE% INCREDIBLY HEAVY TO LEFT- AND THINGS THAT WE WANT TO MOVE FORWARD AS A STATUS AND IF CALIFORNIA IS TO LEAD THE WAY AND THEN WE NEED ALL OF US ON BOARD- AND SO. AGAIN I'LL BE SUPPORTING IN GOOD FAITH AND LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING SOME OF THE ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS AND CONCLUSIONS BE DONE AND APPROPRIATIONS. BUT I WOULD ALSO HOPE. THAT THIS DOES NOT COME TO A FLOOR FIGHT. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WANT TO DO- WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AS WELL. SO I HOPE THAT WERE ABLE TO ACTUALLY COME TO A RESOLUTION AS TO WHERE YOU NEED TO BE. AND WHERE ARE THE OPPOSITION ALSO NEEDS TO BE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE. FIRST OF THANK YOU MISTER SU CHI AND SPONSORS FOR BRING THE BILL FORWARD- THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL IS PROBABLY PROTECTION ESPECIALLY FOR MILLIONS OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN WHO USE COSMETICS IS AND STATE AND BEAUTY PRODUCTS ON A DAILY BASIS. AND ALTHOUGH YOU'RE REMOVING THE PROVISIONS BANNING LEAD IN THIS BEST US AND DESIRED BILL TO GET TO THE VOTE I PERSONALLY WOULD SUPPORT NOT DOING THAT BECAUSE I THINK AS MR MCCARTY MENTION THOSE ARE THE THOSE ARE TO BE CLIENTS AND- THE RISKS ARE VERY VERY% HIGH BUT I UNDERSTAND AND SUPPORT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO- IN THE SAKE OF TRYING TO MAKE PROGRESS ON ON ON A DIFFICULT ISSUE. LAST YEAR A JURY IN NEW YORK AWARDED ONE PLAINTIFF THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS- AGAINST JOHNSON JOHNSON ON A CLAIM THAT IT'S BABY POWDER BECAUSE- MESOTHELIOMA NOW THE JURY IN SAINT LOUIS AWARDED TWENTY TWO WENT WHEN I WOMEN AND THEIR FAMILIES FOUR POINT SIX NINE BILLION DOLLARS PROCLAIMS OF THIS BESTEST IN JOHNSON JOHNSON'S TAPPED OUT PRODUCTS BECAUSE A VERY AND CANCER- CURRENTLY THERE OVER. SIXTEEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED HEALTH RELATED. LAWSUITS PENDING. THESE LAWSUITS PROOF WE CANNOT IGNORE- THE PUBLIC KARMA SO SEE WITH. SOME CHEMICALS- DEPOSITION CLAIMS THE BEAUTY INDUSTRY GENERATES BILLIONS IN OUR ECONOMY AND THAT IS CORRECT I HAVE NO REASON TO DOUBT THAT- IN FACT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE UNITED STATES WAS CONSIDERED THE MOST PROFITABLE. A BEAUTY INDUSTRY MARKET- GENERATING EIGHTY NINE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE- BECAUSE YOU'RE MAKING BILLION SOME PROFIT. THEY SHOULD BEAR THE BURDEN IN MY OPINION OF PRODUCING COSMETICS OR SAFE FOR CONSUMERS. THE BILL IS NOT ASKING MANUFACTURERS TO CHANGE THEIR MANUFACTURING PROCESS BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN DOING THIS IN EUROPE. FOR YEARS- IN MY MIND WHEN THEY MANUFACTURE AND SELL IN EUROPE THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO MANUFACTURE AND SELL THE SAME PRODUCTS IN OUR COUNTRY- I WILL BE VOTING YES- WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE BILL'S WITH FOURTH. ROW ALSO SAY THIS YOU KNOW I'M WORKING ON A TO YOUR BILL IT'S DIFFICULT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT SINCE THE FALL- AND THERE WILL BE CHANGES THAT HAPPEN- VERY YOU KNOW AT THE VERY END BECAUSE THESE SOMETIMES CONTENTIOUS BILLS TAKE TIME. TO REALLY WORK OUT- AND- I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT. I THINK WE'VE SEEN THAT- I THINK OF I THINK BACK TO CAP AND TRADE NEGOTIATIONS AND THINGS THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW. REALLY WHERE WE WERE GOING TO BE ON THAT WE KIND OF HAD AN IDEA- AND WE HAD WE TOOK SOME DIFFICULT VOTES WE PUT OUR FAITH. IN THE AUTHORS WE PUT OUR FAITH IN THE PROCESS I'M BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY AT AT THESE BILLS SO- I'M GONNA SUPPORT THIS TODAY. IT THE BILL- GOES TO THIS IF THE BILL MAKES IT TO THE SENATE AND COMES BACK HERE- IT TO THE FLOOR PROCESS WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY IF THE BILL HAS CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY TO A POINT WHERE WE'RE NOT THRILLED THAT WE CAN PULL IT BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE- AFTER IT LEAVES THE SENATE- BUT YOU HAVE A LONG. OBVIOUSLY HAVE A LONG WAYS TO GO. SO I SAY SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY- MISTER MURATSUCHI WHICH WHAT CLOTHES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE TO ALL OF THE COMMENTS- GOD MADE TODAY AND- YOU KNOW JUST AS I HOPE THAT I HAVE. DEMONSTRATED MY GOOD FAITH TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO COME UP WITH THE BILL. TO GET BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL- I HOPE THAT I CAN COUNT ON YOUR GOOD FAITH TO- SEE THIS IMPORTANT- CONSUMER PROTECTION- BEING ENACT ENACTED HOPEFULLY. YOU KNOW SOONER. RATHER THAN LATER AND WITH THAT I ASKED FOR.
