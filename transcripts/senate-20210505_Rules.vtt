PREVIOUS. CHP FACILITY- WHICH

STATE HAS A SLOW DOWN A BIT-

00:44:48.786 --> 00:44:50.421
MAYBE WITH ADDITIONAL RESOURCES

00:44:50.487 --> 00:44:52.423

ABLE TO ASSIST IN THAT REGARD

00:44:54.224 --> 00:44:56.360
JUST MY OWN THOUGHT- I KNOW

00:44:56.427 --> 00:44:59.329
THAT MOST OF THE RESOURCES TO

OKAY I ONLY HAD ONE LAST

00:48:07.951 --> 00:48:08.552
QUESTION BIG MIKE. ASKED ALL OF

00:48:08.619 --> 00:48:10.387

00:48:12.656 --> 00:48:15.726
OF- HOUSING IN PAST DISCUSSIONS

00:48:15.792 --> 00:48:16.960
WITH CHP WE LEARNED THAT

THE DEPARTMENT EVER CONSIDERED

00:48:28.538 --> 00:48:30.140
EXPANDED THE OPTION TO WORK FOR

HAVE A REAL COMMITMENT TO FIND

01:18:15.023 --> 01:18:16.691
A BALANCE THERE. AND THAT'S

01:18:16.758 --> 01:18:19.061
BASICALLY WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT

01:18:19.127 --> 01:18:21.930

HEALTH CARE. COST TARGETS OF

01:18:26.902 --> 01:18:28.170
CERTAINLY WE'VE LEARNED THAT

01:18:28.236 --> 01:18:30.572
YOU CAN'T COOKIE CUTTER. OF THE

01:18:30.639 --> 01:18:32.741

STATE WE'VE SEEN GREAT OF.

01:18:36.778 --> 01:18:38.280
DIVERGENCE IN COSTS FOR

01:18:38.346 --> 01:18:39.748
DIFFERENT PROCEDURES ESPECIALLY

01:18:39.815 --> 01:18:41.249
I THINK IN THE ORTHOPEDIC WORLD

01:18:41.316 --> 01:18:43.251
WHERE. THE REPLACEMENTS AND

01:18:43.318 --> 01:18:45.220
SOME PARTICULAR HOSPITAL. OUR

01:18:45.287 --> 01:18:47.589
SYSTEMS ARE AT ONE COSTS AND

01:18:47.656 --> 01:18:48.657
OTHER THOUGH THERE ARE

01:18:48.723 --> 01:18:50.192
DIFFERENT COST SO HOW HOW WILL

YOU APPROACH. OF THAT WHOLE

01:18:53.061 --> 01:18:56.698
DISCUSSION OF. TARGET AND- AS

01:18:56.765 --> 01:18:58.867
IMPORTANTLY IF THE TARGETS

01:18:58.934 --> 01:19:00.001
AREN'T BEING MET ONCE THEY'RE

01:19:00.068 --> 01:19:01.903
SET. OUT WHAT APPEARED TO BE

01:19:01.970 --> 01:19:07.642
RATHER SEVERE PENALTIES. THAT

01:19:07.709 --> 01:19:08.243
ARE AT LEAST BEING DISCUSSED.

01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:09.111
THANK YOU CENTER FOR SO YOU

01:19:09.177 --> 01:19:10.445
WORK. TO THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED

01:19:10.512 --> 01:19:12.681
OFF OF HEALTH FOR. IT WOULD BE

01:19:12.747 --> 01:19:14.616
PLACED WITHIN OUR HEAD- WE

01:19:14.683 --> 01:19:15.951
WOULD FOLLOW ON THE HEELS OF

01:19:16.017 --> 01:19:17.152
SEVERAL OTHER STATES THAT HAVE

01:19:17.219 --> 01:19:18.587
HAD GREAT SUCCESS IN TRYING TO

01:19:18.653 --> 01:19:20.689
SET COST TARGETS- BUT OF COURSE

01:19:20.755 --> 01:19:22.757
S ALWAYS VOID. BUT OUR OUR

01:19:22.824 --> 01:19:25.427
CALIFORNIANS FIN ON IT SO-

01:19:25.494 --> 01:19:27.229
FIRST AND FOREMOST WE'VE HEARD

01:19:27.295 --> 01:19:29.498
FROM STAKEHOLDERS THE NEEDS- TO

01:19:29.564 --> 01:19:31.533
WAIT IN TERMS OF WHEN THE THAT

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.435
COST TARGETS WOULD START AND SO

01:19:33.502 --> 01:19:34.870
WE WOULD CERTAINLY NOT USED

01:19:34.936 --> 01:19:36.371
CURRENT PANDEMIC DATA AS A

01:19:36.438 --> 01:19:38.240
BASELINE DATA. WERE LOOKING TO

01:19:38.306 --> 01:19:39.541
HAVE THE FIRST YEAR OF COST

01:19:39.608 --> 01:19:41.843
TARGET STARTED TWENTY TWENTY

01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:42.911
FOUR I KNOW ENFORCEABLE TARGETS

01:19:42.978 --> 01:19:44.913
UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. BUT

01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:46.414
IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA IN

01:19:46.481 --> 01:19:48.483
TERMS OF HOW MUCH BUT HEALTH

01:19:48.550 --> 01:19:50.218
CARE COSTS ARE INCREASING AS

01:19:50.285 --> 01:19:51.153
COMPARED TO THE RATE OF

01:19:51.219 --> 01:19:53.655
INFLATION- ITS FIVE TIMES

01:19:53.722 --> 01:19:54.723
WEEKLY HAD A WEAPON ARE THIS

01:19:54.789 --> 01:19:56.024
WITH THIS- OVER THE LUNCH

01:19:56.091 --> 01:19:57.492
PERIOD TODAY AND LOOK AT SOME

01:19:57.559 --> 01:19:59.861
REALLY STARTLING STATISTICS- SO

01:19:59.928 --> 01:20:04.032
WE KNOW THAT FAMILIES. ARE

01:20:04.099 --> 01:20:04.900
REALLY SUFFERING UNDER THE-

01:20:04.966 --> 01:20:06.101
ANOTHER'S HI HOW CARE COSTS. AS

01:20:06.168 --> 01:20:07.636
OUR- AND US IS THE STATE IS A

01:20:07.702 --> 01:20:10.272
LARGE. OF HEALTH COVERAGE SO-

01:20:10.338 --> 01:20:12.774
IT IS OUR VIEW THAT THE- COSTS

01:20:12.841 --> 01:20:14.376
ARE INCREASING AT A RATE THAT'S

01:20:14.442 --> 01:20:17.045
UNSUSTAINABLE- IN TERMS OF

01:20:17.112 --> 01:20:20.081
SETTING COST TARGETS. WE HAVE

01:20:20.148 --> 01:20:22.884
APPROACH OF HAVING- I ADVISORY

01:20:22.951 --> 01:20:23.952
BOARD THAT WOULD SET THE COST

01:20:24.019 --> 01:20:26.188
TARGETS THAT WOULD BE REVIEWED-

01:20:26.254 --> 01:20:28.957
BY IT BY MY THE- IBM OR THE

01:20:29.024 --> 01:20:31.526
DIRECTOR IN MY ROLE. AND IN

01:20:31.593 --> 01:20:33.628
TERMS OF ENFORCEMENT WE WOULD

01:20:33.695 --> 01:20:35.530
VERY MUCH LOOK TO A PROGRESSIVE

01:20:35.597 --> 01:20:37.766
APPROACH SO THAT THE FIRST THAT

01:20:37.832 --> 01:20:39.935
PEACE WOULD BE TO DO OUTREACH-

01:20:40.001 --> 01:20:40.902
TO THE PARTY THAT MAY NOT HAVE

01:20:40.969 --> 01:20:42.671
MET THE COST TARGETS UNDERSTAND

01:20:42.737 --> 01:20:44.105
LOOK AT THE DATA. MORE

01:20:44.172 --> 01:20:45.707
CAREFULLY WITH THEM THERE WOULD

01:20:45.774 --> 01:20:47.876
BE AN APPEALS PROCESS. AS WELL

01:20:47.943 --> 01:20:49.077
AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:20:49.144 --> 01:20:50.612
CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS BEFORE

01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:52.681
WE GOT ANYWHERE NEAR FINE SO WE

01:20:52.747 --> 01:20:54.482
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. TO BE

01:20:54.549 --> 01:20:59.187
SERIOUS ABOUT ENFORCING BUT. IS

01:20:59.254 --> 01:20:59.921
A PROGRESSIVE FORCES APPROACH.

01:20:59.988 --> 01:21:01.022
I APPRECIATE THAT- I THINK

01:21:01.089 --> 01:21:02.624
WHAT'S IMPORTANT FOR US AYE IN

01:21:02.691 --> 01:21:03.658
THE LEGISLATURE THOUGH THE

01:21:03.725 --> 01:21:05.227
LAWMAKERS AS YOU GO FORWARD

01:21:05.293 --> 01:21:06.828
WITH WITH THE PLAN.

01:21:06.895 --> 01:21:08.396
UNDERSTANDING WHAT ARE THE COST

01:21:08.463 --> 01:21:09.798
DRIVERS AND HAVING A PRETTY

01:21:09.864 --> 01:21:12.567
COMPLETE PRESENTATION. AND SOME

01:21:12.634 --> 01:21:14.936
VALIDATION ON COMPARATIVE DATA

01:21:15.003 --> 01:21:17.072
ON ON WHAT ARE THE COST DRIVERS

01:21:17.138 --> 01:21:19.274
BECAUSE MANY TIMES IT IS ADDING

01:21:19.341 --> 01:21:20.976
MORE SERVICES THAT ARE REQUIRED

01:21:21.042 --> 01:21:22.110
TO BE COVERED BY OUR HEALTH

01:21:22.177 --> 01:21:23.745
PLANS. AND I THINK OF HAT IS

01:21:23.812 --> 01:21:25.146
BEEN ONE OF THE THINGS ARE

01:21:25.213 --> 01:21:26.648
HAVING ONCE UPON A TIME SERVED

01:21:26.715 --> 01:21:28.250
ON THAT BOARD WAS BEFORE H. M.

01:21:28.316 --> 01:21:30.185
O.'S CAME INTO BEING. ONCE THEY

01:21:30.252 --> 01:21:32.187
DID THE CAPITATION ISSUES ARE

01:21:32.254 --> 01:21:34.055
BECAME SIGNIFICANT IN TERMS OF.

01:21:34.122 --> 01:21:36.024
WHAT IT WAS COSTING FOR- YOU

01:21:36.091 --> 01:21:37.525
KNOW COVERAGE SO THOSE ARE

01:21:37.592 --> 01:21:39.995
THINGS THAT I WOULD LOOK FOR ON

01:21:40.061 --> 01:21:41.396
IN TERMS OF. PROPOSED

01:21:41.463 --> 01:21:42.897
LEGISLATION THAT WOULD

01:21:42.964 --> 01:21:45.133
BASICALLY ARE IMPLEMENTED BOB

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:46.801
COSTARRED GOOD FAN PUNISHMENT

01:21:46.868 --> 01:21:49.137
FROM AND ALL OF THAT. LAST

01:21:49.204 --> 01:21:51.339
QUESTION I HAVE IS- REGARDING

01:21:51.406 --> 01:21:54.576
OUR HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE. AND I

01:21:54.643 --> 01:21:55.210
THINK WE'RE ALL CONCERNED

01:21:55.277 --> 01:21:56.778
BECAUSE CERTAINLY IF WE WANT TO

01:21:56.845 --> 01:21:58.280
TALK ABOUT ACCESS WE CERTAINLY

01:21:58.346 --> 01:21:59.314
HAVE TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:21:59.381 --> 01:22:00.248
GOING TO PROVIDE US THE

01:22:00.315 --> 01:22:02.984
SERVICE. SO WHAT DO YOU SEE ARE

01:22:03.051 --> 01:22:04.219
THE MOST PRESSING HEALTH CARE

01:22:04.286 --> 01:22:06.321
WORKFORCE ISSUES. FACING THE

01:22:06.388 --> 01:22:11.559

DELVED INTO THOSE- THAT IF BUT

01:22:21.136 --> 01:22:22.871
IF NOTED THAT THE LACK OF

01:22:22.937 --> 01:22:24.372

WHEN I GOT TO ASK THE LESS THAN

01:22:30.879 --> 01:22:31.780
FIVE MONTHS AGO I WAS CHARGED

01:22:31.846 --> 01:22:33.648
RIGHT AWAY WITH. TRYING TO LOOK

BE A POSSIBILITY THAT IT'S

01:29:37.705 --> 01:29:40.708

HOSPITAL COSTS ARE COMPLICATED.

01:29:47.448 --> 01:29:48.583

01:29:51.519 --> 01:29:53.621
LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE TO LOOK

01:29:53.688 --> 01:29:55.123
AT ALL OF THOSE PIECES SO WOULD

01:29:55.189 --> 01:29:56.624
HAVE TO HAVE TO LOOK AT HOW

01:29:56.691 --> 01:29:58.292
MUCH ARE LABOR. WAGES

01:29:58.359 --> 01:29:59.527
INCREASING BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW

01:29:59.594 --> 01:30:02.330
THAT IS A PRIMARY COST OF EVERY

01:30:02.396 --> 01:30:03.798
HOSPITAL IF THERE WERE A NEW

01:30:03.865 --> 01:30:05.566

WOULD HAVE TO BE A

01:30:06.334 --> 01:30:08.870
CONSIDERATION AS WELL SO. THAT

01:30:08.936 --> 01:30:11.205
THE CONCEPT IS TO SET ONE AN

ECONOMIC INDICATOR- AND- AS THE

01:30:14.842 --> 01:30:17.145
AS THE COST TARGET SO THAT THAT

01:30:17.211 --> 01:30:19.380
WOULD BE TIED TO. INFLATION TO

01:30:19.447 --> 01:30:20.414
ECONOMIC CHANGES BUT WE

01:30:20.481 --> 01:30:22.016

01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:34.295
PROVIDE MORE TRANSPARENCY. IN

01:30:34.362 --> 01:30:36.197
THE PRICE. AND QUALITY OF

01:30:36.264 --> 01:30:37.565
HEALTHCARE NUMBER TO DEVELOP

01:30:37.632 --> 01:30:38.633
COST STARGATES IN DIFFERENT

01:30:38.699 --> 01:30:40.401
AREAS OF HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY.

01:30:40.468 --> 01:30:41.335
NUMBER THREE DEVELOP

01:30:41.402 --> 01:30:42.804
ACCOUNTABILITY FRAMEWORK

01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:45.239
INCLUDING FINANCIAL PENALTIES.

01:30:45.306 --> 01:30:46.340
FOR HEALTH CARE ENTITIES THAT

01:30:46.407 --> 01:30:49.877
DON'T MEET THESE COST TARGETS-

01:30:49.944 --> 01:30:51.779
WHEN THESE COST TARGETS ARE SET

01:30:51.846 --> 01:30:53.581
AND THERE'S JUST NOT A REAL WAY

01:30:53.648 --> 01:30:55.049
ON THE GROUND TO BE ABLE TO

01:30:55.116 --> 01:30:56.784
MEET THESE TARGETS BASED ON.

01:30:56.851 --> 01:30:58.085
THE OBLIGATIONS THAT HOSPITALS

01:30:58.152 --> 01:31:00.354
HAVE ALREADY HAVE IN AND YOU

01:31:00.421 --> 01:31:01.322
KNOW THAT HOSPITALS ALREADY

01:31:01.389 --> 01:31:05.860
HAVING. TO MAINTAIN OUR HEALTH

01:31:05.927 --> 01:31:06.561
PLANS ARE HAVING TO PAY FOR-

01:31:06.627 --> 01:31:07.295
THIS PARTICULAR QUESTION IS

01:31:07.361 --> 01:31:10.164
HEALTH. SO IF HEALTH PLANS CAN.

01:31:10.231 --> 01:31:12.366
REDUCE THE COST TO MEET THOSE

01:31:12.433 --> 01:31:13.868
REQUIREMENTS AND THERE ARE

01:31:13.935 --> 01:31:16.070
TARGETS FIT IN PLACE. AND I

01:31:16.137 --> 01:31:17.572
GUESS I'M JUST GOING TO ASK YOU

01:31:17.638 --> 01:31:20.107
POINT BLANK IS THIS A PLANNER

01:31:20.174 --> 01:31:22.977
POLICY THAT IS MOVING US TO A

01:31:23.044 --> 01:31:25.012
SINGLE PAYER HEALTHCARE SYSTEM.

01:31:25.079 --> 01:31:26.380
NO THIS IS NOT MOVED TO A

01:31:26.447 --> 01:31:27.982
SINGLE PAYER HEALTHCARE SYSTEM

01:31:28.049 --> 01:31:29.817
THIS TRULY IS ABOUT-

01:31:29.884 --> 01:31:31.586
TRANSPARENCY UNDERSTANDING THE

01:31:31.652 --> 01:31:33.654
COST DRIVERS AND SETTING COST

01:31:33.721 --> 01:31:37.358
TARGET SO- EVERY PART OF THE

01:31:37.425 --> 01:31:39.026
PROCESS WOULD START WITH TRYING

01:31:39.093 --> 01:31:41.095
TO WITH CAPTURING DATA ON THE

01:31:41.162 --> 01:31:42.463
TOTAL COST OF CARE LOOKING AT

01:31:42.530 --> 01:31:43.598
PREMIUMS LOOKING AT WHAT

01:31:43.664 --> 01:31:45.132
INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS ARE PAYING

01:31:45.199 --> 01:31:48.369
AND DEDUCTIBLES- IN COPAYS.

01:31:48.436 --> 01:31:50.304
LOOKING INTO MINISTRY BECAUSE

01:31:50.371 --> 01:31:51.606
TAKING THAT TOTAL COST OF CARE

01:31:51.672 --> 01:31:53.007
AND SETTING A COSTS ARE GOING

01:31:53.074 --> 01:31:53.975
TO GET IT COULD BE AT THE RATE

01:31:54.041 --> 01:31:55.910
OF INFLATION IT COULD BE TO THE

01:31:55.977 --> 01:31:59.513
GDP- AND THEN HAVING THAT APPLY

01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:01.549
TO- MOST MEMBERS. OF THE

01:32:01.616 --> 01:32:03.784
HEALTHCARE MARKET BUT THERE'S

01:32:03.851 --> 01:32:07.822
NOTHING DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE

01:32:07.889 --> 01:32:08.756
SINGLE PAYER NOW MA'AM. IS

01:32:08.823 --> 01:32:11.525
THERE A PLAN TO- STREAMLINE THE

01:32:11.592 --> 01:32:12.994
PROCESS FOR PERMITTING FOR

01:32:13.060 --> 01:32:15.129
CHANGES OR- BUILDING GOING BACK

01:32:15.196 --> 01:32:16.364
TO THE BUILDINGS OF HOSPITALS

01:32:16.430 --> 01:32:18.466
AND- RETROFITTING AND YOU KNOW

01:32:18.532 --> 01:32:20.534
WINGS BEING ADDED. BECAUSE YOU

01:32:20.601 --> 01:32:22.436
KNOW THERE'S- EVERY OTHER STATE

01:32:22.503 --> 01:32:23.671
HAS SOME TYPE OF CONCEPTUAL

01:32:23.738 --> 01:32:26.407
PROCESS FROM BEGINNING TO END.

01:32:26.474 --> 01:32:29.977
BUT CALIFORNIA DOESN'T AND-

01:32:30.044 --> 01:32:31.312
THEY DON'T WE DON'T EVEN START

01:32:31.379 --> 01:32:33.414
WITH A COMPLETE PROCESS BEFORE

01:32:33.481 --> 01:32:35.816
CONSTRUCTION ON THE PROJECT

01:32:35.883 --> 01:32:38.886
EVEN GET STARTED AND THEM. IT'S

01:32:38.953 --> 01:32:40.321
VERY FRUSTRATING FOR A LOT OF

01:32:40.388 --> 01:32:42.023
THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE TRYING

01:32:42.089 --> 01:32:43.524
TO MEET THESE NEEDS THE

01:32:43.591 --> 01:32:44.959
STANDARDS THAT ARE SET OUT OF

01:32:45.026 --> 01:32:46.861
THIS BUILDING AND ALSO- AND

01:32:46.928 --> 01:32:47.395
DEAL WITH THE RETROFITTING

01:32:47.461 --> 01:32:50.164
ISSUE. IT'S GENERALLY SPEAKING

01:32:50.231 --> 01:32:52.366
IT'S ABOUT TWO MILLION DOLLARS

01:32:52.433 --> 01:32:54.468
A BAD FOR CONSTRUCTION. IN

01:32:54.535 --> 01:32:56.837
CALIFORNIA VERSES ABOUT EIGHT

01:32:56.904 --> 01:32:57.505
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN

01:32:57.571 --> 01:33:00.007
MOST MOST OTHER STATES. IN THE

01:33:00.074 --> 01:33:02.176
HOSPITAL- THE PEOPLE THAT THE

01:33:02.243 --> 01:33:03.711
HOSPITAL WORK WITH ENGINEERS

01:33:03.778 --> 01:33:04.679
THOSE KINDS INDIVIDUALS THAT

01:33:04.745 --> 01:33:06.147
BUILD THESE MEGA SHIPS

01:33:06.213 --> 01:33:09.250
MAGNIFICENT DISABILITIES- IT'S

01:33:09.317 --> 01:33:10.418
BECAUSE OF THE DELAY IN THE

01:33:10.484 --> 01:33:11.953
APPROVAL PROCESS AND THE

01:33:12.019 --> 01:33:14.121
PROCESS ITSELF IS THERE A- IS

01:33:14.188 --> 01:33:14.922
THERE A WAY THAT YOU COULD

01:33:14.989 --> 01:33:16.557
POSSIBLY HAVE YOUR TEAM LOOK AT

01:33:16.624 --> 01:33:17.858
THE PROCESS AND HOW IT'S

01:33:17.925 --> 01:33:20.194
CONTINUALLY DELAYED AND- MAINLY

01:33:20.261 --> 01:33:21.329
HAVE A- A CONCEPT FROM

01:33:21.395 --> 01:33:22.363
BEGINNING TO END FOR

01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:24.532
CONSTRUCTION AND NOT JUST KEEP

01:33:24.598 --> 01:33:25.866
MOVING IT IF THAT MAKES SENSE.

01:33:25.933 --> 01:33:27.368
THANK YOU SENATOR GROW SO IT'S

01:33:27.435 --> 01:33:29.036
TRUE THAT AUSTIN DOES THAT THE

01:33:29.103 --> 01:33:31.038
BUILDING STANDARDS- AND THOSE

01:33:31.105 --> 01:33:33.474
ARE SET IN CODE. AND WE HAVE A

01:33:33.541 --> 01:33:35.142
HOSPITAL BUILDING SAFETY BOARD

01:33:35.209 --> 01:33:36.277
WITH MANY MEMBERS OF THE

01:33:36.344 --> 01:33:37.611
HOSPITAL INDUSTRY AS WELL AS

01:33:37.678 --> 01:33:39.680
OTHERS THAT PARTICIPATE IN THAT

01:33:39.747 --> 01:33:41.849
SO THERE ARE STANDARDS. THAT WE

01:33:41.916 --> 01:33:44.518
HAVE TO MAKE SURE ARE HERE TOO

01:33:44.585 --> 01:33:45.686
BUT IN THE CONTEXT OF THAT

01:33:45.753 --> 01:33:47.121
THERE'S A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH

01:33:47.188 --> 01:33:48.723
BETWEEN OPTION HAD STRUCTURAL

01:33:48.789 --> 01:33:50.224
ENGINEERS AND ARCHITECTS IN

01:33:50.291 --> 01:33:52.526
LIFE AND SAFETY FOLKS A LOT OF

01:33:52.593 --> 01:33:54.562
BACK AND FORTH TO UNDERSTAND

01:33:54.628 --> 01:33:56.564
WHAT THE NEEDS OF THE HOSPITAL

01:33:56.630 --> 01:33:59.266
ALL. DO A LOT. HAVING AND

01:33:59.333 --> 01:34:01.102
APPROACHES OF HOW THEY MAY BE

01:34:01.168 --> 01:34:02.236
ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THEIR

01:34:02.303 --> 01:34:03.337
BUILDINGS ALL WITHIN THE

01:34:03.404 --> 01:34:05.706
CONFINES OF BUILDING STANDARDS

01:34:05.773 --> 01:34:08.376
CERTAINLY HAPPY TO LOOK AT- AT

01:34:08.442 --> 01:34:10.745
SPECIFIC APPROACHES BUT- AGAIN

01:34:10.811 --> 01:34:12.380
MY TEAM HAS MADE A LOT OF

01:34:12.446 --> 01:34:14.281
STRIDES IN THE LAST DECADE TO

01:34:14.348 --> 01:34:16.083
INNOVATE TO TRY TO HAVE A

01:34:16.150 --> 01:34:17.018
COLLABORATIVE APPROACH WITH

01:34:17.084 --> 01:34:18.886
HOSPITALS TO MEET THE SHARED

01:34:18.953 --> 01:34:20.955
GOAL OF SENATE HAVING THIS

01:34:21.022 --> 01:34:22.323
HOSPITALS MEET STANDARDS AND

01:34:22.390 --> 01:34:24.258
MAINTAIN PATIENT SAFETY WHILE

01:34:24.325 --> 01:34:26.727
ALSO HAVING IN. A PROCESS THAT

01:34:26.794 --> 01:34:29.196
WORKS FOR ALL PARTIES AND THANK

01:34:29.263 --> 01:34:30.664
YOU FOR THAT I THINK WE ARE THE

01:34:30.731 --> 01:34:32.099
ISSUES I THINK WE JUST HAVE A

01:34:32.166 --> 01:34:34.635
DIFFERENCE OF OPINION ON AND A

01:34:34.702 --> 01:34:36.504
TIMELY PROCESS I MEAN IT TOOK

01:34:36.570 --> 01:34:37.872
ALMOST THIRTY YEARS TO BUILD A

01:34:37.938 --> 01:34:39.306
HOUSE BUT WHEN I HAVE TO HAVE

01:34:39.373 --> 01:34:42.710
TO BE AREA- AND- IT WAS THE ARE

01:34:42.777 --> 01:34:44.712
SPREAD PROCESS THAT STOP TO

01:34:44.779 --> 01:34:46.414
THAT HOSPITAL FROM MOVING

01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:48.916
FORWARD AFTER TO BONDS AND- IT

01:34:48.983 --> 01:34:50.885
WAS A VERY DIFFICULT AND THAT'S

01:34:50.951 --> 01:34:55.256
A REAL COMMUNITY IT. HAD- JEFF

01:34:55.322 --> 01:34:55.990
UNTIL LAST YEAR THE YEAR JUST

01:34:56.057 --> 01:34:57.591
TWO YEARS AGO TWO THOUSAND

01:34:57.658 --> 01:34:58.659
NINETEEN CODE KIND OF THROWS ME

01:34:58.726 --> 01:35:00.795
OFF SO I APOLOGIZE BUT- JUST

01:35:00.861 --> 01:35:02.563
RECENTLY THE DAY HAD MOVED FROM

01:35:02.630 --> 01:35:03.664
A HOSPITAL THAT WERE THEY WERE

01:35:03.731 --> 01:35:05.199
STILL WILLING OXYGEN BOTTLES

01:35:05.266 --> 01:35:06.834
DOWN THE HALLWAY AND THEY HAD

01:35:06.901 --> 01:35:08.769
CONCRETE. AND CINDER BLOCKS

01:35:08.836 --> 01:35:10.671
WHERE THE NURSES STATION WAS.

01:35:10.738 --> 01:35:12.873
AND IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO GET

01:35:12.940 --> 01:35:13.774
INTO A STATE OF THE ART

01:35:13.841 --> 01:35:15.776
FACILITY AND BECAUSE OF THE

01:35:15.843 --> 01:35:16.744
PROCESS THAT THEY HAVE TO GO

01:35:16.811 --> 01:35:19.914
THROUGH. WITH US BED SO- WE'RE

01:35:19.980 --> 01:35:21.382
GOOD WE'VE BUILT OUR HOSPITAL

01:35:21.449 --> 01:35:23.250
BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER-

01:35:23.317 --> 01:35:24.585
COMMUNITIES THAT I HEAR FROM

01:35:24.652 --> 01:35:25.686
THAT ARE GOING THROUGH THE SAME

01:35:25.753 --> 01:35:27.188
PROCESS. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

01:35:27.254 --> 01:35:29.356
HOW WE GOT IT DONE IN YOU KNOW

01:35:29.423 --> 01:35:31.292
LESS THAN FORTY YEARS IT'S I

01:35:31.358 --> 01:35:33.527
JUST THINK THAT TIME FRAME. IS

01:35:33.594 --> 01:35:34.829
SIGNIFICANT I THINK WE CAN

01:35:34.895 --> 01:35:36.097
BUILD A STATE OF THE ART

01:35:36.163 --> 01:35:38.866
HOSPITAL. IN A IN A SOONER TIME

01:35:38.933 --> 01:35:42.937
FRAME THAN THAT SO IF YOU WOULD

01:35:43.003 --> 01:35:43.504
LOOK AT THAT I WOULD REALLY

01:35:43.571 --> 01:35:44.738

THAT CALIFORNIA TENDS TO PRIDE

01:36:22.076 --> 01:36:25.246
ITSELF ON AND SO- WE I THINK

01:36:25.312 --> 01:36:26.747

DEPARTMENT WE TALKED ABOUT A

01:36:29.450 --> 01:36:31.118
FEW THINGS THAT I WANT TO

PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICING- AND

01:36:40.361 --> 01:36:42.663
WE KNOW THAT- WITH OSCAR PET

01:36:42.730 --> 01:36:44.465
DRUG MANUFACTURERS ARE REQUIRED

01:36:44.532 --> 01:36:46.767
TO NOTIFY YOU ALL- I GUESS WHEN

01:36:46.834 --> 01:36:47.935
THEY'RE INTRODUCING A NEW DRUG

01:36:48.002 --> 01:36:49.703
INTO THE MARKET PLACE OR WHEN

01:36:49.770 --> 01:36:52.573
THERE'S AN INCREASE IN PRICING-

01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:55.142

COLLECTIONS- ARE SO LOW

01:37:13.928 --> 01:37:15.095
ESPECIALLY SINCE WE TALKED

01:37:15.162 --> 01:37:16.297
ABOUT ENFORCEMENT I WAS LOOKING

01:37:16.363 --> 01:37:17.965

THE REQUIREMENTS BUT IT'S BEEN

01:37:57.404 --> 01:37:58.939
LONG ENOUGH AND IT'S TIME FOR

01:37:59.006 --> 01:38:00.341
MANUFACTURERS TO UNDERSTAND

01:38:00.407 --> 01:38:01.875

01:38:43.984 --> 01:38:45.386
HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION REALLY

01:38:45.452 --> 01:38:47.254
ASKING FOR SOME FLEXIBILITY

01:38:47.321 --> 01:38:51.358
WITH REGARDS TO- THE COMPLIANCE

01:38:51.425 --> 01:38:53.127
ISSUES BECAUSE OF CODED AND THE

01:38:53.193 --> 01:38:56.297
COSTS. THAT THEY'VE HAD T- FOR

01:38:56.363 --> 01:38:59.133
ABSORB- AND SO JUST WANTED TO

01:38:59.199 --> 01:39:00.501
KNOW IF YOU COULD. TALK A

01:39:00.567 --> 01:39:01.568
LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW TO THREAD

01:39:01.635 --> 01:39:03.337
THAT NEEDLE NEON THE

01:39:03.404 --> 01:39:04.305
FLEXIBILITY ISSUE WITH

COMPLIANCE. AND ALSO WITH

01:39:06.206 --> 01:39:08.409
REALITY BECAUSE THE REALITY IS

01:39:08.475 --> 01:39:09.510
THAT THERE ARE QUITE A FEW

01:39:09.576 --> 01:39:12.279
HOSPITALS WHO HAVE- RAKED IN A

01:39:12.346 --> 01:39:13.814
NUMBER OF PROFITS HAVE HAD A

AN UNUSUAL STRAIN ON HOSPITALS-

01:40:03.630 --> 01:40:04.431
BUT THE WORK DOES NEED TO
