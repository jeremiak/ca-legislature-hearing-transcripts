ONE WERE SHE NOTES UNDER TABLE

00:47:14.131 --> 00:47:18.435
THE AYLER B. AND THERE U. S. W.

00:47:18.502 --> 00:47:20.204
SEVEN I COULD AND I. DON'T CAN-

00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:22.806
DON'T HAVE NO NO WAY TO PROVE

00:47:22.873 --> 00:47:26.510
THAT I STARTED MY EYES- BUT THE

00:47:26.577 --> 00:47:28.745
L. A. B. IS JUST TO HELP THE U.

00:47:28.812 --> 00:47:30.781
S. W. AND NOT THE WORKERS. AND

00:47:30.847 --> 00:47:32.816
MY OWN EXPERIENCE AND I WERE

00:47:32.883 --> 00:47:34.218
MICHAEL WORKERS ALL THE FROM

00:47:34.284 --> 00:47:36.053
WHICH THAT I KNOW MORTGAGE

00:47:36.119 --> 00:47:38.989
THOUSAND FARMWORKERS. I BELIEVE

00:47:39.056 --> 00:47:40.924
I KNOW MORE FARMWORKERS THEN THE

00:47:40.991 --> 00:47:45.229
A LARGE B- AND- A LONG TIME AGO

00:47:45.295 --> 00:47:47.030
WE WERE PLANNING AND WE WERE

00:47:47.097 --> 00:47:48.999
TALKING ABOUT THIS WITH MY

00:47:49.066 --> 00:47:51.435
COWORKERS AND GRANDMA FARMI TO

00:47:51.501 --> 00:47:55.872
SHUT DOWN THE L. R. P. I THINK.

00:47:55.939 --> 00:47:58.141
I THINK THAT THAT'S OF MY- MAYBE

00:47:58.208 --> 00:48:02.312
CAN SO AT MAY. THAT MONEY THEY-

00:48:02.379 --> 00:48:03.814
USE IT GOOD HOW US IN THE NEXT

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:06.216
WAY. BUT NOT NOT LEAVING ALL

00:48:06.283 --> 00:48:11.722
THAT MY WITH A ALIVE. AND ALSO.

00:48:11.788 --> 00:48:17.227
THE U. S. W. AND THE L. R. V.

00:48:17.294 --> 00:48:18.762
WHEN WE WENT THROUGH THIS BAD

00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:22.633
EXPERIENCE WITH THEM. THEY WERE

00:48:22.699 --> 00:48:24.668
ENOUGH TO SEND US BACK TO

00:48:24.735 --> 00:48:27.170
MEXICO. SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN

00:48:27.237 --> 00:48:29.806
THAT MEANS THAT THEY DON'T CARE

00:48:29.873 --> 00:48:32.509
ABOUT THE FARMWORKERS. AND THIS

00:48:32.576 --> 00:48:35.345
IS SOMETHING THAT WE WORLD WAR

00:48:35.412 --> 00:48:37.281
ONE AND LIKE MANY YEARS AGO TO

00:48:37.347 --> 00:48:40.317
SHUT DOWN THE L. A. B. AND

00:48:40.384 --> 00:48:44.121
HOPEFULLY- THAT WOULD HAPPEN.

00:48:44.187 --> 00:48:46.623
AND THAT'S MY EXPERIENCE THAT I

00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:49.192
SHARE WITH YOU GUYS- I'M TALKING

00:48:49.259 --> 00:48:50.394

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:52.863
LEFT IT WITH WITH WITH MY

00:48:52.929 --> 00:48:56.700

CHOICE AND I'M JUST GOING ON

00:49:02.839 --> 00:49:04.074
HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND I THINK

00:49:04.141 --> 00:49:07.944
THIS NEEDS TO STOP. FIFTY TWO

00:49:08.011 --> 00:49:11.081

THERE'S NO POINT TO HAVE THE

00:49:25.228 --> 00:49:27.097
OFFICE OF THE ELLERBEE WENT

THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD I DON'T

01:10:00.696 --> 01:10:02.765

YOU ENDED UP A WE DID- SYNDROME

01:10:33.762 --> 01:10:35.331
BECAUSE THIS. THE IS THE

01:10:35.397 --> 01:10:37.199
BIGGEST. AND THEY A LOT OF

01:10:37.266 --> 01:10:37.967
REASONS. IT JUST. SIXTEEN SORT

01:10:38.033 --> 01:10:39.635
OF EXPLODED THE WAY THAT IT DID

01:10:39.702 --> 01:10:41.670
DURING PANDEMIC OR HEART OF

01:10:41.737 --> 01:10:44.173
THIS WAS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A

01:10:44.239 --> 01:10:45.841
MASSIVE. OF ABUSE OF THE

01:10:45.908 --> 01:10:48.577
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR STATUS.

01:10:48.644 --> 01:10:52.047
AND SO. MANY I DON'T KNOW THE

01:10:52.114 --> 01:10:56.251
EXACT NUMBER BUT- MANY. OF WHO

01:10:56.318 --> 01:10:59.421
SHOULD BE EMPLOYEES IT WOULD BE

01:10:59.488 --> 01:11:03.525
COVERED WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM-

01:11:03.592 --> 01:11:05.461
WERE EITHER REQUIRED TO TAKE

01:11:05.527 --> 01:11:07.563
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR STATUS OR

01:11:07.630 --> 01:11:09.031
THEY WANTED TO TAKE INDEPENDENT

01:11:09.098 --> 01:11:10.966
CONTRACTOR STATUS AND THAT OF

01:11:11.033 --> 01:11:14.069
COURSE. LEFT THEM OUT OF THE

01:11:14.136 --> 01:11:16.472
EMPLOYMENT BECAUSE NOBODY WAS

01:11:16.538 --> 01:11:18.607
PUTTING IN THERE I CAN YOU PICK

01:11:18.674 --> 01:11:21.243
OUT. EVEN NOT PUTTING IN AND IF

01:11:21.310 --> 01:11:22.778
YOU FOLLOW THE INDEPENDENT

01:11:22.845 --> 01:11:24.580
CONTRACTOR STATUS THERE WOULD

01:11:24.647 --> 01:11:26.415
NOT HAVE BEEN AS MANY PEOPLE

01:11:26.482 --> 01:11:29.184
IMPACTED OVER UP BY THAT SO I

01:11:29.251 --> 01:11:31.086
THINK THERE'S A NUMBER OF

01:11:31.153 --> 01:11:34.256
CONNECTED ISSUES. OF THAT I HOPE

01:11:34.323 --> 01:11:37.960
ARE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY- WOULD

01:11:38.027 --> 01:11:39.962
BE NICE TO SORT OF GET DIFFERENT

01:11:40.029 --> 01:11:42.631
PEOPLE'S UP BEFORE YOU DO THAT

01:11:42.698 --> 01:11:45.534
BEFORE THEY DO THE STUDY IS WHAT

01:11:45.601 --> 01:11:46.869
THEY THINK SHOULD BE INCLUDED.

01:11:46.935 --> 01:11:51.273
YOU KNOW IN THAT. OF BUT I KNOW

01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:53.042
BEING SELF EMPLOYED IS REALLY

01:11:53.108 --> 01:11:54.109
DIFFERENT FROM BEING AN

01:11:54.176 --> 01:11:56.378
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR WHERE IS

01:11:56.445 --> 01:11:58.747
THE MONEY GOING TO COME FROM WE

JUST HAD- THE NUMBER PROPOSALS

01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:05.354
ON HOW WE HELP BUSINESSES. ON

01:12:05.421 --> 01:12:08.390
THE COST OF EDT BECAUSE OF THE

01:12:08.457 --> 01:12:11.593
PANDEMIC AND SO THAT'S A LOT

01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:14.296
THAT'S A LOT TO. PUT INTO IT MHM

01:12:14.363 --> 01:12:14.797
THE BOTTOM LINE IS I'M

01:12:14.863 --> 01:12:16.331
SUPPORTING BECAUSE I APPRECIATE

01:12:16.398 --> 01:12:18.734

01:12:21.437 --> 01:12:22.771
YOU KNOW WHETHER TO SUPPORT OR

01:12:22.838 --> 01:12:25.007
NOT SUPPORT OF AN ACTUAL PROGRAM

01:12:25.074 --> 01:12:27.009

01:12:27.076 --> 01:12:29.344
IT WOULD BE AN ELECTIVE COVERAGE

01:12:29.411 --> 01:12:32.381
FOR. SO THAT'S AT LEAST A

01:12:32.448 --> 01:12:33.449
CONCERT. WITH DRESSIER I MEAN

01:12:33.515 --> 01:12:34.283

WHAT WAS REASONABLY EXPECTED.

01:25:49.477 --> 01:25:50.712
SUCH OF THE COMPOSITION WOULD

01:25:50.778 --> 01:25:52.113
TRIGGER THE EMPLOYER TO HAVE

01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:53.648

RESPONDING TO YOUR DISTRICT AND

01:26:23.244 --> 01:26:25.046
IT'S CLEAR THAT THERE ARE- OUR

01:26:25.113 --> 01:26:28.349
ISSUES MERMAID ONE OF THE MAIN

01:26:28.416 --> 01:26:30.285
PRACTICAL POINTS I WAS GOING TO

01:26:34.222 --> 01:26:36.057
UP PROVIDING AN EMPLOYEE AN

01:26:36.124 --> 01:26:38.526
INCREASE AS THE ANALYSIS SAYS-

01:26:38.593 --> 01:26:41.362
THAT- WHEN THE LATER EMPLOYEE

01:26:41.429 --> 01:26:42.597
PROVIDES THE EMPLOYED INCREASE

01:26:42.664 --> 01:26:44.766
IN COMPENSATION BEYOND WHAT

01:26:44.832 --> 01:26:46.601
WOULD HAVE BEEN REASONABLY

01:26:46.668 --> 01:26:47.735
EXPECTED AND AS I WALKED IN THE

01:26:47.802 --> 01:26:49.504
BILL ANALYSIS I NEVER SAW A

01:26:49.571 --> 01:26:51.940

01:26:52.006 --> 01:26:55.543
EXPECTED AND I'M SURE. I AM THAT

01:26:55.610 --> 01:26:58.346
WALK DEFINITION. AS SOMEBODY IN

01:26:58.413 --> 01:26:59.480
THE MID NINETEEN SEVENTIES WHOSE

01:26:59.547 --> 01:27:01.950

EIGHT YEARS AS A CABINET

SECRETARY AND- A AND I'M SURE

01:27:09.624 --> 01:27:11.459
SANTA CRUZ COUNTY WAS VERY

01:27:11.526 --> 01:27:13.561
BEGRUDGING ABOUT. HAVING TO HAVE

01:27:13.628 --> 01:27:16.497
ACTUARIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR

01:27:16.564 --> 01:27:17.832
WHAT MY CABINET SECRETARY.

01:27:17.899 --> 01:27:21.736
SALARY WISE NEVER THE LAST IT'S

01:27:21.803 --> 01:27:23.771
HE HE I THINK THE INTERESTING

01:27:23.838 --> 01:27:26.407
THING TO ME WOULD BE. IS ON THE

01:27:26.474 --> 01:27:28.476
WHOLE ISSUE OF RECIPROCITY. HAS

01:27:28.543 --> 01:27:32.547
IT ONLY GONE ONE WAY. AS IT ONLY

01:27:32.614 --> 01:27:34.749
GONE FROM OF THE FIRE DISTRICT

01:27:34.816 --> 01:27:36.985
LOSING PEOPLE THAT GO TO HIGHER

01:27:37.051 --> 01:27:39.754
PAID ONES AND THEN. THE EXACT

01:27:39.821 --> 01:27:43.224
QUOTE WAS WHAT WAS ANECDOTAL

01:27:43.291 --> 01:27:45.193
WASN'T DEMONSTRATED TO ME FACT

01:27:45.259 --> 01:27:47.028
RULING BECAUSE IF IT TURNS OUT

01:27:47.095 --> 01:27:48.997
THAT THAT FACT IS AN ISSUE

01:27:49.063 --> 01:27:51.332
EVERYWHERE IN THE STATE CLEARLY

01:27:51.399 --> 01:27:54.235
DEMONSTRABLE BY THEIR FAX. MAYBE

01:27:54.302 --> 01:27:55.870
AT SOME POINT WE SHOULD TALK

01:27:55.937 --> 01:27:58.339
ABOUT IT BUT IT'S IT I FIND IT

01:27:58.406 --> 01:28:01.109
GOES BACK AND FORTH AND WE HAD

01:28:01.175 --> 01:28:02.710
TROUBLE WHEN I WAS MAYOR. OVER

01:28:02.777 --> 01:28:04.879
THE FACT THAT WE WERE A LITTLE

01:28:04.946 --> 01:28:07.248
COASTAL CITY. AND OVER THE HILL

01:28:07.315 --> 01:28:08.716
WAS SENATOR CORTESE'S

01:28:08.783 --> 01:28:11.085
JURISDICTION THAT WOULD HIRE

01:28:11.152 --> 01:28:13.354
AWAY ARE TRAINED POLICE OFFICERS

01:28:13.421 --> 01:28:14.222
FOR THIRTY OR FORTY THOUSAND

01:28:14.288 --> 01:28:15.890
DOLLARS MORE A YEAR AFTER WE

01:28:15.957 --> 01:28:17.625
STRUGGLED WITH THEM TO GET

01:28:17.692 --> 01:28:18.993
THROUGH THE POST ACADEMY SO I

01:28:19.060 --> 01:28:22.330
UNDERSTAND THAT. FORTUNATELY A

01:28:22.397 --> 01:28:23.931
LOT OF THEM WANTED TO LIVE BY

01:28:23.998 --> 01:28:25.233
THE COAST AND THAT MIGHT

01:28:25.299 --> 01:28:26.567
COUNTERBALANCE THE ECONOMIC

01:28:26.634 --> 01:28:29.270
DISADVANTAGE BUT THAT WAS A

01:28:29.337 --> 01:28:31.906
DISADVANTAGE AND IT WAS ALSO

01:28:31.973 --> 01:28:33.241
TRUE WITH OUR SHERIFF'S

01:28:33.307 --> 01:28:34.575
DEPARTMENT IN THE SANTA CLARA

01:28:34.642 --> 01:28:36.377
SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. AND OTHER

01:28:36.444 --> 01:28:39.881
THINGS SO ARM I RECOGNIZE THAT

01:28:39.947 --> 01:28:41.783
THIS MAY WELL BE AN ISSUE I JUST

01:28:41.849 --> 01:28:43.518
DON'T THINK THIS BILL IS FULLY

01:28:43.584 --> 01:28:44.719
BAKED AND I THINK SOME OF THE

01:28:44.786 --> 01:28:46.721
FACTS ARE NOT FULLY IN EVIDENCE

01:28:46.788 --> 01:28:49.057
YET AND- I WOULD BE WILLING OVER

01:28:49.123 --> 01:28:50.491
THE COURSE OF TIME TO CONTINUE A

01:28:50.558 --> 01:28:53.494
CONVERSATION BUT- I'M- GOING TO

01:28:53.561 --> 01:28:57.265
VOTE NO ON THE BILL. TODAY I

01:28:57.331 --> 01:28:59.167
THINK SOONER LEARN COULD JUST. A

01:28:59.233 --> 01:29:02.070
QUICK- I REALLY AM SYMPATHETIC

01:29:02.136 --> 01:29:03.871
TO. THE CASE THAT YOU'VE MADE

01:29:03.938 --> 01:29:05.573
TODAY IN THE WITNESSES HAVE HAVE

01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:08.109
MADE TODAY. I THINK THE HARD

01:29:08.176 --> 01:29:09.610
PART FOR ME SOMEONE HAS BEEN

01:29:09.677 --> 01:29:11.679
ALLUDED TO HERE. IS THAT THERE'S

01:29:11.746 --> 01:29:13.314
A STATEWIDE SYSTEM COVERS

01:29:13.381 --> 01:29:16.718
MILLIONS OF WORKERS IN ALL KINDS

01:29:16.784 --> 01:29:20.388
OF CLASSIFICATIONS AND JOBS- AND

01:29:20.455 --> 01:29:23.124
CITIES AND COUNTIES AND

01:29:23.191 --> 01:29:25.293
DISTRICTS. AND IT'S HARD TO MAKE

01:29:25.359 --> 01:29:27.395
A DECISION THAT WILL IMPACT

01:29:27.462 --> 01:29:28.796
POTENTIALLY IMPACT THE WHOLE

01:29:28.863 --> 01:29:33.367
STATE. FOR WHAT APPEARED TO BE

01:29:33.434 --> 01:29:36.204
SOME YOU KNOW OF SITUATIONS OF

01:29:36.270 --> 01:29:38.873
UNFAIRNESS OR GREATER HARDSHIP

01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:41.042
SO I THINK THAT'S THE PROBLEM

01:29:41.109 --> 01:29:44.312
TODAY AND I THINK. THIS SHOULD

01:29:44.378 --> 01:29:46.180
BE A WAY OF ADDRESSING THE

01:29:46.247 --> 01:29:47.915
ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP

01:29:47.982 --> 01:29:50.551
THIS TODAY DOESN'T SEEM TO BE

01:29:50.618 --> 01:29:52.453
THE RIGHT WAY TO DO THAT WHEN

01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:53.921
THERE'S ISSUE SEEMS LOPSIDED TO

01:29:53.988 --> 01:29:56.524
FIX IT IN THE WAY THAT WE'RE

01:29:56.591 --> 01:30:01.028
PROPOSING SO. OKAY SEE NO OTHER-

01:30:01.095 --> 01:30:04.398

NEEDS IS A LOT. MORE

01:30:12.874 --> 01:30:15.309

01:38:39.046 --> 01:38:41.148
BUSINESS. AND THEY THEY DON'T

01:38:41.215 --> 01:38:42.883
HAVE THE MEANS TO CREATE A PURSE

01:38:42.950 --> 01:38:44.518
AND IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED. IN THE

01:38:44.585 --> 01:38:45.152
LITTLE TOWN OF LOYALTON FOR THE

01:38:45.219 --> 01:38:46.654
FIRST TIME. IN HISTORY OUR STATE

01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:48.422
WE HAD THIS HAPPEN WHERE THE

01:38:48.489 --> 01:38:50.157
CITY WENT BANKRUPT. AND THE LADY

01:38:50.224 --> 01:38:52.693
THAT WAS AT WORK FOR THE CITY

01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:54.228
FOR FOREVER AND PAID INTO PERSON

01:38:54.295 --> 01:38:55.796

01:39:00.534 --> 01:39:01.935
IT TURNS INTO THEIR THEIR THE

01:39:02.002 --> 01:39:02.770
DEFINED BENEFIT WENT AWAY. AND

01:39:02.836 --> 01:39:04.605
SO. THAT COULD HAPPEN IN THE END

01:39:04.672 --> 01:39:05.906
IT COULD HAPPEN REALLY FAST WHEN

01:39:05.973 --> 01:39:07.975
THE WHEN THE MARKET CHANGES IN

01:39:08.042 --> 01:39:09.176
THESE. LOCAL AGENCIES ARE

01:39:09.243 --> 01:39:10.778
REQUIRED TO PUT THE MONEY AND

01:39:10.844 --> 01:39:12.713
THERE'S NO MONEY THERE. SO LOOK

01:39:12.780 --> 01:39:13.814

THEY BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION AND

01:39:27.861 --> 01:39:29.029
BUT MOST AGENCIES ARE THINK THAT

01:39:29.096 --> 01:39:30.597
SOMEBODY ELSE IS GONNA TAKE CARE

01:39:30.664 --> 01:39:32.633

01:59:30.563 --> 01:59:32.598
DO A LOT THAT DOESN'T EXACTLY

01:59:32.665 --> 01:59:34.634
MORE DIRECTLY SPECIFICALLY

01:59:34.700 --> 01:59:38.504
ADDRESS A GENDER- PAY INEQUITIES

01:59:38.571 --> 01:59:40.940
BUT IT'S AN EXAMPLE OF I THINK

01:59:41.007 --> 01:59:42.875
WHAT WORLD TRYING TO DO TOGETHER

01:59:42.942 --> 01:59:46.979

FOR WOMEN. AND- I'M TRYING TO

THINK OF ALL THE- THE REASONS OF

01:59:58.124 --> 02:00:01.127
WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT TO

02:00:01.193 --> 02:00:05.298
WOMEN- WE KEEP GETTING. YOU KNOW

02:00:05.364 --> 02:00:07.733
THE SHORT END WHEN IT COMES TO

02:00:07.800 --> 02:00:10.136
RETIREMENT SICK YOU YOU NAME IT

02:00:10.202 --> 02:00:12.071

WHICH WOMEN ARE NOT- GET THE

02:00:14.941 --> 02:00:17.276

ORDER FOR THANK YOU- IT'S EASY

02:00:30.656 --> 02:00:32.291
TO ALIGN MYSELF WITH THE

02:00:32.358 --> 02:00:33.292
COMMENTS OF THE OF THE TWO

02:00:33.359 --> 02:00:35.328
PREVIOUS NUMBERS BECAUSE I THINK

02:00:35.394 --> 02:00:40.566
IN PARTICULAR THE GOAL HERE IS-

02:00:40.633 --> 02:00:42.501
ONE THAT WE STRONGLY AGREE ON

02:00:42.568 --> 02:00:44.370
IT'S QUESTION OF THE BILL

02:00:44.437 --> 02:00:46.939
ALIGNING WITH THE GOAL. AND I

02:00:47.006 --> 02:00:48.874
THINK THAT'S WHAT A CENTER

02:00:48.941 --> 02:00:50.476
CORTESE WAS ADDRESSING AND

02:00:50.543 --> 02:00:52.645
GIVING YOU THE CHANCE TO DO THAT

02:00:52.712 --> 02:00:54.847
TO HAVE THE CONTENTS OF THE BILL

02:00:54.914 --> 02:00:57.249
ON AND- USE THAT THROUGH ME.

02:00:57.316 --> 02:00:58.851
YESTERDAY ANOTHER COMMITTEE I

02:00:58.918 --> 02:01:01.187
THINK TWICE ASKING PEOPLE WHEN

02:01:01.253 --> 02:01:03.122
IT WAS SAID THAT IT WAS A WORK

02:01:03.189 --> 02:01:04.790
IN PROGRESS WHAT THEIR PLAN WAS

02:01:04.857 --> 02:01:07.126
THE TWO ND BEING A WORK IN

02:01:07.193 --> 02:01:08.961
PROGRESS I THOUGHT MAYBE. I

02:01:09.028 --> 02:01:10.863
WOULD ASK IT HOW DO YOU SEE

02:01:10.930 --> 02:01:13.532
GOING FROM HERE TO WORK SOME OF

02:01:13.599 --> 02:01:14.900
THESE THINGS OUR DAY IN THE

02:01:14.967 --> 02:01:16.936
HOPES THAT THAT YOU CAN ADDRESS

02:01:17.003 --> 02:01:18.871
THE ISSUE. WELL IT A THINK WE'LL

02:01:18.938 --> 02:01:21.040
CONTINUE THAT TO KIND OF LOOK

02:01:21.107 --> 02:01:22.308
WORK ONE WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE

02:01:22.375 --> 02:01:23.876
YOU KNOW HEAR FROM THE

02:01:23.943 --> 02:01:24.844
OPPOSITION BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO

02:01:24.910 --> 02:01:26.145
IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE IF

02:01:26.212 --> 02:01:27.847
THERE'S NOT A BILL THERE'S NOT A

02:01:27.913 --> 02:01:28.981
CONVERSATION AND SO FOR DECADES

02:01:29.048 --> 02:01:31.250
AS HAS BEEN STATED WE KNOW AND

02:01:31.317 --> 02:01:31.851
RECOGNIZE THAT WHETHER IT'S

02:01:31.917 --> 02:01:33.552
BENEFITS WHETHER IT'S RETIREMENT

02:01:33.619 --> 02:01:34.487
WHETHER IT'S SALARIES. THERE'S A

02:01:34.553 --> 02:01:35.888
DISCREPANCY AND I THINK THERE'S

02:01:35.955 --> 02:01:38.357
REALLY ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE

02:01:38.424 --> 02:01:40.059
THAT HAPPENED YOU KNOW IT TO BE

02:01:40.126 --> 02:01:42.061
WOMEN IN THE LEGISLATURE SCARING

02:01:42.128 --> 02:01:44.563
THESE BILLS- TO TRY TO FIGURE

02:01:44.630 --> 02:01:47.333
OUT IF THERE'S A SYSTEMIC WAY TO

02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:47.967
CHANGE IT SO TRUTHFULLY I THINK

02:01:48.034 --> 02:01:50.069
IT'S GOING TO BE ONE COMMITTEE

02:01:50.136 --> 02:01:51.737
ONE STEP AT A TIME AND WORKING

02:01:51.804 --> 02:01:52.638
CLOSELY WITH OUR THOUGHT LEADERS

02:01:52.705 --> 02:01:54.440
ARE CHAIRS ARE COMMITTEES. AT TO

02:01:54.507 --> 02:01:56.876
FIGURE OUT A PATH- WHETHER THIS

02:01:56.942 --> 02:01:58.944
BILL MOVES FORWARD TODAY-

02:01:59.011 --> 02:02:00.346
WHETHER IT MOVES FORWARD YOU

02:02:00.413 --> 02:02:01.747
KNOW BY THE END OF AUGUST THIRTY

02:02:01.814 --> 02:02:03.616
FIRST I THINK IT'S STILL NEEDS

02:02:03.683 --> 02:02:04.917
TO BE A CONVERSATION AND WITHOUT

02:02:04.984 --> 02:02:05.584
LEGISLATIVE ANALYSIS OR INPUT I

02:02:05.651 --> 02:02:07.953
AM GETTING GET NO WORK SO MY

02:02:08.020 --> 02:02:09.121
PATHWAY IS TO START HERE. AND

02:02:09.188 --> 02:02:11.824
SEE HOW FAR I CAN GET A AND I

02:02:11.891 --> 02:02:13.793
THINK THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE

02:02:13.859 --> 02:02:14.927
SOMETHING THAT WHETHER IT MAKES

02:02:14.994 --> 02:02:17.296
IT OUT THIS YEAR OR YOU KNOW IN

02:02:17.363 --> 02:02:19.632
FUTURE YEARS WE WILL HAVE. A

02:02:19.699 --> 02:02:21.934

THE DISCREPANCY AND THE GAPS

02:02:28.174 --> 02:02:29.942
AREN'T GOING AWAY AND I THINK

02:02:30.009 --> 02:02:31.777
THE OTHER PIECE THAT'S REALLY

02:02:31.844 --> 02:02:32.878
IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE IS THAT

02:02:32.945 --> 02:02:34.680
WHILE WE TRY TO ADVANCE SOME OF

02:02:34.747 --> 02:02:36.315

FIFTY FOR THE RECORD. UNDER THIS

02:04:17.583 --> 02:04:19.518
SPELL. TWO SIMILARLY INJURED

02:04:19.585 --> 02:04:21.287
WORKERS COULD RECEIVE DIFFERENT

02:04:21.353 --> 02:04:23.789
TREATMENT UNDER THE LAW SIMPLY

02:04:23.856 --> 02:04:27.426
BECAUSE OF THEIR GENDER. TO BASE

02:04:27.493 --> 02:04:28.694
AN INJURED WORKER'S DISABILITY

02:04:28.761 --> 02:04:31.463
PAYMENT IN HIS OR HER GENDER IS

02:04:31.530 --> 02:04:35.267
UNFAIR AND DISCRIMINATORY. IT

02:04:35.334 --> 02:04:36.802
ALSO VIOLATES THE EQUAL

02:04:36.869 --> 02:04:39.205
PROTECTION CLAUSE OF THE US

02:04:39.271 --> 02:04:42.608
CONSTITUTION. I WOULD LIKE TO

ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUES TO

02:04:43.943 --> 02:04:45.177
CONSIDER THE WORK OF THE LATE

02:04:45.244 --> 02:04:47.213
JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG MOST

02:04:47.279 --> 02:04:48.981

CARING FOR HIS ELDERLY MOTHER

02:04:53.118 --> 02:04:55.487
THAT HAD BEEN DENIED CARE GIVING

02:04:55.554 --> 02:04:58.090
TAX DEDUCTION BECAUSE HE WAS AN

02:04:58.157 --> 02:05:01.460
UNMARRIED MAN. JUSTICE GINSBURG

02:05:01.527 --> 02:05:02.761
UNDERSTOOD THAT DISCRIMINATION

02:05:02.828 --> 02:05:05.130
ON THE BASIS OF SEX REGARDLESS

02:05:05.197 --> 02:05:08.667
ABOUT SEX HARMS EVERYONE. THREE

02:05:08.734 --> 02:05:10.903
QUALITY WILL NOT BE BORN OUT OF

02:05:10.970 --> 02:05:13.405
FURTHER INEQUALITY AND FOR THESE

02:05:13.472 --> 02:05:15.207
REASONS I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING

02:05:15.274 --> 02:05:17.776
THE BILL- AT THIS TIME AND I DO

02:05:17.843 --> 02:05:20.279
URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO RECONSIDER

02:05:20.346 --> 02:05:22.948

AS IT INVOLVED IN IS YOU WORK

02:05:27.119 --> 02:05:29.521
FOR BECAUSE I DO YOU KNOW. THAT

02:05:29.588 --> 02:05:30.956
YOUR INTENT IS ALWAYS ABOUT

02:05:31.023 --> 02:05:33.158
HAVING CONVERSATIONS AND MOVING

02:05:33.225 --> 02:05:35.327
THE NEEDLE FORWARD SO ON THAT

02:05:35.394 --> 02:05:37.062
PRINCIPLE I DO LOOK FORWARD TO

02:05:37.129 --> 02:05:39.064
SEE HOW THIS BILL INVOLVES AND

02:05:39.131 --> 02:05:42.167
WHAT YOU'RE ABLE TO DO ON THIS

02:05:42.234 --> 02:05:44.803
FRONT SO- THANK YOU. THANK YOU

02:05:44.870 --> 02:05:46.572
AND I APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS

02:05:46.639 --> 02:05:48.140
AND NO OFFENSE TAKEN AND IT'S

02:05:48.207 --> 02:05:50.042
ACTUALLY THAT EXACT SAME VALUE

02:05:50.109 --> 02:05:52.011
OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN

02:05:52.077 --> 02:05:53.579
THAT IS NOT PROTECTED WHERE WE

02:05:53.646 --> 02:05:55.581
START WITH WAGES SO THE GOOD

02:05:55.648 --> 02:05:57.583
NEWS IS I HAVE A WAGE BILL AS

02:05:57.650 --> 02:05:58.651
WELL. THAT ADDRESSES THIS

02:05:58.717 --> 02:06:01.153
DISCRIMINATION OF PEACE AND SO

02:06:01.220 --> 02:06:03.622
IT IS A PROBLEM WHEN WOMEN SO

02:06:03.689 --> 02:06:05.324
THIS IS ABOUT WORKERS COMP AND

02:06:05.391 --> 02:06:09.128
HISTORY. RATE OF WOMEN NOT.

02:06:09.194 --> 02:06:10.796
BEING PAID WHAT THEY SHOULD BE

02:06:10.863 --> 02:06:12.431
PAID THEIR FOR THEIR WORKERS

02:06:12.498 --> 02:06:16.068
COMP IS ALSO INSUFFICIENT WELL

02:06:16.135 --> 02:06:17.703
THERE IS A BILL AT TO GET MORE

02:06:17.770 --> 02:06:19.738
INFORMATION AND DATA IN TERMS OF

02:06:19.805 --> 02:06:21.640
WHAT THAT PAGE GET. THAT WAGE

02:06:21.707 --> 02:06:24.276
GAP IS IN TERMS OF SALARY AND SO

02:06:24.343 --> 02:06:26.512
THIS IS A RIPPLE EFFECT ON AND

02:06:26.578 --> 02:06:27.947
CERTAINLY TRYING TO APPROACH IT

02:06:28.013 --> 02:06:29.281
WITH A DIFFERENT LENS IS VERY

02:06:29.348 --> 02:06:31.250
DIFFICULT BUT IT REALLY IS BASED

02:06:31.317 --> 02:06:32.284
ON THAT SAME PRINCIPLE THAT IT

02:06:32.351 --> 02:06:34.553
IS ILLEGAL. TO PAY WOMEN PEOPLE

02:06:34.620 --> 02:06:37.156
OF COLOR. A DIFFERENT AMOUNT

02:06:37.222 --> 02:06:39.325
BASED ON RACE AND GENDER AND

02:06:39.391 --> 02:06:41.060
THAT IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

02:06:41.126 --> 02:06:43.095
SOLVE STILL DESPITE WHATEVER IN

02:06:43.162 --> 02:06:45.097
PERFECT BILL IS IN FRONT OF YOU.

02:06:45.164 --> 02:06:47.866
IT IS ABSOLUTELY ABOUT TRYING TO

02:06:47.933 --> 02:06:50.102
IDENTIFY HOW WE GET TO THE CORE

02:06:50.169 --> 02:06:53.305
PROBLEM THAT IN THIS STATE IN

02:06:53.372 --> 02:06:55.307
THIS COUNTRY THERE ARE STILL

02:06:55.374 --> 02:06:57.609
WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR WHO

02:06:57.676 --> 02:07:00.112
ARE BEING PAID. LESSER BECAUSE

02:07:00.179 --> 02:07:02.014
OF THEIR RACE AND GENDER AND

02:07:02.081 --> 02:07:05.617
DATA. HISTORICAL DATA SHOWING.

02:07:05.684 --> 02:07:07.653
AND WE ARE TRYING TO FIND OF
