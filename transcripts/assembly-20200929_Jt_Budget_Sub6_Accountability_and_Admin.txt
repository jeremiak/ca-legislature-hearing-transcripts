GIVE A FEW BRIEF OPENING REMARKS AND TURN OVER TO MAD MADAM CHAIR AS WELL AS WE KNOW THAT. ECONOMIC D. D. KANEMI THAT WE X. ON THE LAST IT NINE YEAR. WITH A HUGE UPTICK IN THE ECONOMY HAS SLOWLY COME TO AN END- WITH GOING INTO A COMPLETE NINETEEN APPEARS THAT WE ARE SLOWLY MOVING INTO A RECESSION. GIVEN THAT THE FISCAL SITUATION THE STATE WILL BE CHANGING SIGNIFICANTLY- THIS LAST YEAR WAS THE FIRST DEFICIT YEAR THAT WE'VE HAD IN QUITE A NUMBER OF YEARS SINCE THE- GREAT RECESSION. AND WHILE WE WERE MAKING VERY VERY DIFFICULT BUDGET DECISIONS A DEAD BIG THE QUESTION AS TO WHERE THE STATE DOES SPEND ITS MONEY. SO WE WANT TO TAKE THIS TIME DURING RECESS AS WE GET READY FOR NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET. TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHERE THE STATE EXPENDITURES ARE GOING. WELL WHAT INVESTMENTS WE HAVE MADE THE WHITE HOUSE- WHAT HAS LAGGED IN WHAT HAS GROWN AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE FOR PROVIDING THIS VERY. VERY VERY HELPFUL AND EXTRAORDINARILY USEFUL A HANDOUT. AND AGAIN IT'S JUST VERY CRITICAL FOR US TO UNDERSTAND. THE FLEXIBILITY WE DO HAVE IN THE GENERAL FUND AND WHAT AREAS WE DON'T HAVE FLEXIBILITY. TO REALLY DO APPRECIATE. MY FELLOW TEACHER TODAY MISTER NORTH WHO TO THE- OF MINISTRY REVIEW CA WHO WAS REALLY THE ONE WANTED TO HAVE THE- I JUST WANT TO THANK HER FOR. HER WILLINGNESS TO DO INTO THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC AND I THINK FOR OUR FOR US TO HAVE OF. MEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I AS KNOW CAL. IS CAN FOR A MOMENT OF INCOME TO. A DEVASTATING PANDEMIC. A PANDEMIC INDUSTRY. AS THE ECONOMIC CRISIS THAT WE HAVE FACED SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION IN A MOMENT LIKE THIS- THE SIMPLE TRUTH IS THAT THERE ARE NO EASY ANSWERS- EQUALLY THERE CAN BE NO SACRED COWS- SO I THINK THIS HEARING. IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO TAKE A REALLY HARD LOOK AT SPENDING ACROSS OUR STATE'S DEPARTMENTS AGENCIES AND PROGRAMS AND AT THE GOAL IS TO IDENTIFY. OPPORTUNITIES FOR SAVINGS OPPORTUNITIES FOR EFFICIENCIES AND I THINK FOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE TRADE OFFS SO THAT WE ARE ABLE TO MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS FOR CALIFORNIA AND- THE BEST DECISIONS FOR THE CALIFORNIANS WHO. HAVE ENTRUSTED US TO HELP NAVIGATE THROUGH THIS TIME OF CRISIS TWO THANK YOU TO ALL OF OUR PANELISTS FOR JOINING US TODAY AND- AFTER ALL OF THAT THE WORK THAT SAID THAT YOU DID IN PREPARATION FOR THIS HEARING. AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR A FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER WITH US GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR. HOSTING US AS WELL ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE MEMBERSHIP.

THANK YOU CHAIR MADAM AND IN HOLLINGS WITH ALLEGED AND OFFICE I'M I'M TO BE SPEAKING TO YOU TODAY FROM A HANDOUT THAT HOPEFULLY YOU ALREADY HAVE- IN FRONT OF YOU AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE FOLLOWING ALONG AT HOME- THAT YOU CAN FIND A HAND OUT AT DILIO DOT CA DOT GOV ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE WEBSITE. SO MY PRESENTATION TODAY IS GOING TO HAVE. FOUR DIFFERENT PARTS AND BEFORE I GET INTO THE MEAT OF THE PRESENTATION I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU A BIT OF AN OVERVIEW. ON THE VARIOUS TOPICS THAT ARE GOING TO BE COVERING BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO COVER QUITE A LOT OF GROUND. SO THE FIRST- IN THOSE FOUR AREAS THE FIRST ONE IS GOING TO BE ABOUT TRENDS IN THE STATE BUDGET AND IN PARTICULAR LOOKING AT. HOW STATE SPENDING HAS CHANGED OVER TIME OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF DECADES AND I'M KIND OF FOCUSING IN. ON THE LAST DECADE IN PARTICULAR. THE SECOND TOPIC AREA IS GOING TO BE ABOUT HOW STATE EXPENDITURES ARE ORGANIZED SO. WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT FUNDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE STATE BUDGET ONE OF THE FUNCTIONS OF THOSE FUNDS- AND HOW CAN WE THINK OF OUR CATEGORIES OF STATE SPENDING. THE FOURTH AREA WILL BE ABOUT STATE OPERATIONS IN PARTICULAR AND THIS IS THE COSTS THAT ARE INCURRED BY THE STATE. IN ORDER TO RUN SERVICES TO RICHER PROVIDE SERVICES OR TO RUN PROGRAMS. LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT VERY BRIEFLY. AND THEN THE FOURTH AREA WILL BE ABOUT ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IN PARTICULAR. AND IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE AREA I'LL TALK ABOUT HEAD QUARTER COSTS AND STATEWIDE GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND FEES ARE. A VERY SMALL SUBSET OF WHAT WE THINK OF AS STATE. OPERATIONS COSTS. SO STARTING WITH THE FOR PAGE. THIS IS SHOWING ESSENTIALLY. THE STATE BUDGET HAS COMPAREDTO THE STATE ECONOMY. OVER TIME SINCE THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE CHART AND ESSENTIALLY T'S IT AS A SHARE SO- IT FOR IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES THE STATE OF. THE STATE BUDGET WAS ABOUT 4% OF THE OVERALL STATE ECONOMY AND I'M NOT ROSE OVER THE NEXT FEW DECADES UNTIL THE LATE NINETEEN SEVENTIES. TO BE ABOUT EIGHT PERCENT. BUT SINCE THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES TE STATE BUDGET AS A SHARE OF THE ECONOMY HAS REALLY REMAINED FLAT IT'S OCELLATED. ABOUT BETWEEN 7% AND EIGHT PERCENT. IT TENDS TO RISE IN TIMES OF ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THEN FALL A BIT IN TIMES OF RECESSION- BUT REALLY WHAT YOU CAN TAKE FROM THIS GRAPHIC IS THAT THE STATE ECONOMY. AND THE STATE BUDGET HAVE GROWN BASICALLY AT THE SAME PACE ARE VERY CLOSE TO THE SAME PACE ON AVERAGE. OVER THE LAST DECADE IN PARTICULAR ANY BEEN OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES. I'M NOT RATE OVER THE LAST DECADE HAS BEEN ABOUT FIVE AND A HALF PERCENT. SO TURNING THE NEXT. THAT FIVE IN HALF PERCENT IS AN AVERAGEACROSS ALL OF STATE PROGRAMS. BUT THE POINT OF THIS GRAPHIC IS TO SHOW HOW ABOUT FIVE AND A HALF PERCENT HAS REALLY VARIED BY PROGRAM BECAUSE THERE IS QUITE A LOT OF VARIATION. SO THE COMPLICATED GRAPHIC ON A WALK THROUGH IT SOMEWHAT SLOWLY. EACH OF THE BUBBLES IN THIS GRAPHIC ARE SHOWING YOU A DIFFERENT PROGRAM. THE LARGEST ONE IS FOR K. TWELVE EDUCATION. THE NEXT ONE IS FOR MEDIC CAL THE STATE'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM FOR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. AND THEIR ORGANS FROM TO. THOSE BY. BROUGHT AND- PER. ON AND NATURI. AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS. CRIMINAL JUSTICE ETCETERA. FROM RIGHT TO LEFT THE GRAPHIC IS SHOWING YOU HOW QUICKLY OR HOW SLOWLY. THAT PROGRAM HAS GROWN OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS FROM TWENTY ELEVEN TWELVE. TO TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. ALL NOTED SINCE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE WAS SORT OF AN UNUSUAL BUDGET YEAR THAT THOSE NUMBERS WOULD LOOK A BIT DIFFERENT IF YOU TEXT SAVE. NINETEEN TWENTY OR IF YOU PICKED A DIFFERENT ENDPOINTS. AND SIMILARLY THEY WOULD LOOK DIFFERENT IF YOU PENSION EARLIER YEAR- SINCE TWENTY ELEVEN TWELVE A SORT OF AT THE END OF. THE LAST YOU KNOW AS THE STATE WAS SORT OF PULLING OUT OF THE GREAT RECESSION AND THE BUDGET WAS CHANGING AT THAT TIME. BUT HONESTLY WITH ONE OF THESE GRAPHICS THE- NO MATTER WHAT SELECTION YOU MAKE IN TERMS OF WHERE YOU. YOU KNOW KIND OF START AND END IS GONNA AFFECT. WHERE THE BUBBLES ARE BUT THE GENERAL TRENDS WILL ALWAYS YOU KNOW WHERE IT WILL. GENERALLY BE ABOUT STUDY. SO AS YOU CAN SEE. I DO. RELATED HAVE GROWN. MORE ALLOW ON OUR- WITH THE REST OF THE PROGRAM'S. AND IN PARTICULAR K. TWELVE EDUCATION COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE A BIT BELOW OR RIGHT AROUND THE FIVE AND A HALF PERCENT. WHEREAS CHILD CARE AND PRESCHOOL AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. A GROWING A BIT FASTER THAN AVERAGE. JUSTICE PROGRAMS CONVERSELY ON AVERAGE HAVE GROWN LESS THAN. THAT AVERAGE FIVE AND A HALF PERCENT CLOSER TO THREE TO FOUR PERCENT. AND THEN HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS HAVE TENDED TO GROW FASTER THAN AVERAGE FASTER THAN FIVE AND A HALF PERCENT IN PARTICULAR IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES WHICH HAVE BROWN. ACTUALLY QUITE QUICKLY COMPARED TO OTHER STATE PROGRAMS. TURNING TO THE NEXT PAGE I'M GONNA START TALKING INTO THE SECOND SECTION OF THE PRESENTATION WHICH IS ABOUT HOW STATE EXPENDITURES ARE ORGANIZED. AND I'M GONNA BEGIN WITH AS A JUST AN OVERVIEW OF HOW FUNDS ARE ORGANIZED IN THE STATE BUDGET. SO THERE ARE THREE TYPES. OF FUNDS IN THE STATE BUDGET THE FIRST IS THE GENERAL FUND. SECOND OR SPECIAL FUNDS OF WHICH THERE ARE HUNDREDS AND THEN THIRD IS FEDERAL FUNDS. THE GENERAL FUND IS THE STATE'S MAIN OPERATING ACCOUNT IT IS THE FUNDED THAT RECEIVES GENERAL PURPOSE REVENUES LIKE PERSONAL INCOME TAX SALES AND USE TAX REVENUES. AND THE LEGISLAURE CAN ALLOCATE FUNDS IN THE GENERAL FUND FOR ANY PUBLIC PURPOSE. SPECIAL FUNDS CONVERSELY ARE THOSE FUNDS THAT ARE CREATED FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES- AND THEY RECEIVE DEDICATED REVENUE SOURCES. THEN THE LEGISLATURE HAS MUCH LESS FLEXIBILITY IN ALLOCATING SPECIAL FUNDS LEGISLATURE CAN REALLY ONLY ALLOCATE SPECIAL FUND REVENUES CHIU PURPOSES FOR WHICH THAT FUND WAS CREATED. AN EXAMPLE. HERE WOULD BE THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT. SO THIS IS A FUNDED RECEIVES REVENUES FROM VEHICLE REGISTRATION FEES LICENSE OUR DRIVER'S LICENSE FEES AND THEN THE FUND CAN ONLY BE SPENT ON TRANSPORTATION RELATED- PROGRAMS. AND THEN FINALLY THERE FEDERAL FUNDS FEDERAL FUNDS ARE USUALLY DEDICATED TO SPECIFIC PROGRAMS ARE PURPOSES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL PROVIDE THE STATE WITH FUNDING TO RUN A CERTAIN PROGRAMMER AS A MATCH ON TOP OF STATE FUNDING FOR A PROGRAM AND OFTEN THIS COMES WITH STRINGS ATTACHED SUCH THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SAYS. THIS IS HOW STATE HAS TO A THE PRO THIS HOW THE STATE- IS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM. THE NEXT PAGE IS JUST A VISUAL DESCRIPTION OF THE GENERAL FUND. AND THE MANY MANY STILL HOT THOUGH HUNDREDS OF OUR SPECIAL FUNDS THAT THE STATE HAS. SO AS YOU CAN SEE THE LARGE PIE CHART IN THE MIDDLE THAT'S THE GENERAL FUND AND THEN EACH OF THE SMALL CIRCLES AROUND THE SIDE ABOUT HARD CHART ARE EACH OF THE INDIVIDUAL SPECIAL FUNDS. THAT THE STATE HAS ALTHOUGH ACTUALLY SOME OF THE VERY SMALL SPECIAL FUNDS OR EVEN EXCLUDED FROM THIS CHART. THE GENERAL FUND AS YOU YOU KNOW AS YOU CAN SEE IN THIS IS THIS CHART IS. BY FAR THE LARGEST IT'S A HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY. AND EACH OF THE SPECIAL FUNDS COLLECTIVELY. ARE ABOUT SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS BUT INDIVIDUALLY OR- SPECIAL FUNDS TEND TO YOU KNOW EVEN AT THEIR LARGEST BE ONLY A COUPLE BILLION OR A FEW BILLION DOLLARS. US SOME PROGRAMS ARE. ESSENTIALLY ENTIRELY GENERAL FUND FUNDED THAT'S MOSTLY EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOR EXAMPLE. AND SOME PROGRAMS LIKE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS ARE ALMOST ENTIRELY SPECIAL FUND FUNDED WHEN IT COMES TO US STATE FUNDS. AND THEN SOME PROGRAMS ARE A MIX OF THE TWO SO HEALTH PROGRAMS N PARTICULAR TEND TO BE A MIX OF GENERAL FUND FUNDED AND SPECIAL FUNDS FUNDED. TURNING TO THE NEXT PAGE. ON PAGE FIVE SO NOW I'M GONNA TALK A BIT ABOUT HOW STATE EXPENDITURES ARE ORGANIZED AND THIS IS YOU KNOW THE CATEGORIES BY WHICH THE STATE SPENDS MONEY SO THERE ARE THREE CATEGORIES HERE STATE OPERATIONS LOCAL ASSISTANCE IN CAPITAL OUTLAY OF THE THREE STATE OPERATIONS AND LOCAL ASSISTANCE ARE BY FAR THE LARGEST IN THE ONES THAT WILL FOCUS THE MOST ATTENTION ON IN THIS PRESENTATION. STATE OPERATIONS COSTS ARE THOSE COSTS THAT ARE INCURRED DIRECTLY BY THE STATE GOVERNMENT. TO RUN A PROGRAM OR DELIVER A SERVICE SO AN EXAMPLE HERE WOULD BE CORRECTIONS. THE STATE'S PRISONS ARE OWNED AND OPERATED BY THE STATE MOST OF THE EMPLOYEES I PRESENTS OUR STATE EMPLOYEES. AND SO THE VAST MAJORITY OF COSTS FOR CORRECTIONS ARE CONSIDERED STATE OPERATIONS COST. LOCAL ASSISTANCE CONVERSELY ARE AMOUNTS THAT ARE PROVIDED BY THE STATE GOVERNMENT TO OTHER ENTITIES FOR THOSE ENTITIES TO. DELIVER SERVICES ARE RUN PROGRAMS THOSE OTHER ENTITIES ARE ARE MANY BUT THEY CAN BE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR EXAMPLE OR OUT OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE HEALTH PLANS SO HE EXAMPLE HERE WOULD BE K. TWELVE EDUCATION THE VAST MAJORITY OF K. TWELVE EDUCATION SPENDING IS LOCAL ASSISTANCE. BECAUSE THE STATE PROVIDES MONEY TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT FOR THOSE ENTITIES TO DELIVER EDUCATIONAL SERVICES TO STUDENTS THEY'RE CAPITAL OUTLAY FINALLY IS THE PURCHASE OF LAND OR- BUILDING OF BUILDINGS THAT ARE ON STATE LAND- FOR THE PURPOSES OF PROVIDING SERVICES AND IT'S A MUCH SMALLER AMOUNT AS YOU'LL SEE IN THE NEXT. PAGE SO THE NEXT PAGE PAGE SIX. PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF OUR STATE COSTS FOR THESE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES SO. AND THE LITTLE INSERT AT THE TOP OF THE GRAPHIC IS GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW MUCH STATEMONEY FOR SPECIAL FOUNDRESSES GENERAL FUND IS SPENT ON LOCAL ASSISTANCE STATE OPERATIONS AND CAPITAL OUTLAY. AS YOU CAN SEE BOTH FOR THIS BUT BOTH FOR THE SPECIAL FUNDS AND FOR THE FOR LOCAL ASSISTANCE ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF GENERAL FUND IS LOCAL ASSISTANCE AND OVER HALF OF SPECIAL FINE MONEY IS FOR LOCAL ASSISTANCE. AND THEN THE REST OF THE GRAPHIC SHOWS YOU WHY BY PROGRAM AREA SO AS YOU CAN SEE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND EDUCATION K. TWELVE EDUCATION ARE OVERWHELMINGLY- LOCAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS THESE ARE PROGRAMS THAT THE STATE GIVES MONEY TO OTHER ENTITIES TO RUN THE PROGRAM. CONVERSELY I ALREADY TALKED ABOUT CORRECTIONS CORRECTIONS IS MORE OF  STATE OPERATIONS PROGRAM BECAUSE PRISONS ARE RUN BY THE STATE HIGHER EDUCATION IS A MIX OF THE TWO THE REASON FOR THIS IS A LITTLE BIT FUNNY BUT ESSENTIALLY UNIVERSITIES CSU AND UC ARE CONSIDERED STATE AGENCIES. AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS ARE CONSIDERED LOCAL ENTITIES AND SO IT'S ABOUT HALF AND HALF OR ROUGHLY THERE. AND TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS. ARE MOSTLY STATE OPERATIONS. BECAUSE STATE APARTMENTS THAT APART OF MOTOR. AND CALIFORNIA OF TRANSPORTATION AGAIN. OUR DEPARTMENTS THAT EMPLOYEE STATE EMPLOYEES AND THEN THEY TO THOSE EMPLOYEES DELIVER SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE THROUGH THE DMV FIELD OFFICES. TURNING TO THE NEXT PAGE THIS IS SHOWING- ESSENTIALLY THE MIX OF FINES AND FUNCTIONS BY DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND BY DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS. SO STARTING FROM THE BOTTOM TO THE TOP THIS IS ORGANIZED BY TYPE OF AGENCY SO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES FIRST AND THEN EDUCATION TRANSPORTATION ETCETERA. ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE GRAPHIC WE'RE SHOWING YOU THE SIZE OF THE PROGRAM BY TOTAL FUNDS INCLUDING FEDERAL FUNDS. AS YOU CAN SEE THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY IS THE LARGEST WHEN YOU INCLUDE FEDERAL FUNDS WITH A LITTLE BIT OVER HALF OF TOTAL FUNDS BEING FEDERAL FUNDS. IN ABOUT A THIRD BEING GENERAL FUND AND THEN THE REST A SPECIAL FUNDS. SIMILARLY EDUCATION WHICH IS SLIGHTLY SMALLER IS NEARLY ALL GENERAL FUND FUNDED WITH SOME FEDERAL FUNDS AND TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS ARE NEARLY ALL SPECIAL FUNDS FUNDED WITH SOME. GENERAL FUND I'M SORRY WITH SOME FEDERAL FUNDS BUT THE LEFT SIDE OF THE GRAPHIC SHOWS YOU BY DEPARTMENT HOW MUCH IS THAT DEPARTMENT STATE OPERATIONS VERSUS LOCAL ASSISTANCE. THE SIZE OF THE BARS ARE NOT TO DO NOT CORRESPOND TO THE SIZE OF THE DEPARTMENT SO FOR EXAMPLE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IS MUCH LARGER. THAN THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS BUT- THE BARS ARE JUST SCALE TWO HUNDRED SO THAT YOU CAN SEE THE PROPORTION NH VERY EASILY. AND AS YOU CAN SEE FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES WHICH RUNS THE STATE'S MEDICAL PROGRAM THIS IS OVERWHELMINGLY LOCAL ASSISTANCE BECAUSE THIS IS MONEY THAT DH CS GIVES TO. HEALTH PLANS ARE DIRECTLY TO HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS CHIU CITIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- IN ORDER TO. PAY FOR HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS OR TO PAY DIRECTLY FOR HEALTH CARE SERVICES. CONVERSELY THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS IS OVERWHELMINGLY STATE OPERATIONS AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE STATE'S FIVE STATE HOSPITALS ARE OPERATED BY THE STATE MOST OF THE EMPLOYEES WHO ARE EMPLOYED THERE ARE STATE EMPLOYEES- AND THEY ARE AT THE STATE IS ESSENTIALLY PROVIDING THAT SERVICE DIRECTLY TO INDIVIDUALS. OKAY SO TURNING TO THE NEXT PAGE I'M GONNA TALK JUST BRIEFLY ABOUT STATE OPERATIONS THIS IS THE THIRD SECTION OF THE PRESENTATION. AND I WANTED TO FIRST ASSOCIATE OPERATIONS AS I'VE ALREADY MENTIONED. ARE THE AMOUNTS THAT THE STATE PAYS JUST TO DELIVER SERVICES DIRECTLY- THEY'RE NOT ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS TO GET TO ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IN THE NEXT SECTION- AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE TOPOGRAPHIC STATE OPERATIONS COSTS ARE FUNDED ABOUT TWO THIRDS BY GENERAL FUND AND ONE THIRD BY SPECIAL FUNDS. AND THOSE COSTS ARE DISTRIBUTED AROUND A VARIETY OF DEPARTMENTS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION ALREADY UNIVERSITIES WHICH ARE ALL CONSIDERED STATE OPERATIONS COSTS- DEBT SERVICES ALL STATE OPERATIONS COSTS ON THE SPECIAL FUNDS LIGHTED TENDS TO BE FOR TRANSPORTATION AGING. AND THEN FOR SOME ENVIRONMENTAL AND NATURAL RESOURCE PROGRAMS. THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE SHOWS. HOW STATE OPERATION COSTS ARE SPENT AS YOU CAN SEE THE MAJORITY OF STATE OPERATION COSTS ARE SPENT ON STATE EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION- SALARIES AND THEN ALSO BENEFITS. SO THE LARGE POT YOU KNOW PIE SLICE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE GRAPHIC. IS STATE EMPLOYEE SALARIES AND BENEFITS INCLUDING PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS THAT THE STATE MAKES. THE NEXT SLICES HEALTH. OUR HEALTH BENEFITS FOR STATE EMPLOYEES THAN OTHER POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS WHICH IS RETIREE HEALTH MOSTLY. AND TEACHERS PENSION BENEFITS OF THIS IS THE AMOUNT THAT THE STATE PAYS. FOR TEACHERS PENSIONS BUT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ALSO PAY. AND THEN THE REST OF SLICES. IN NOT STATE OPERATE ARE FOR OTHER COSTA COSTS FOR UNIVERSE. WHICH ARE MAKE OF SALA AND ALL CROSS AND THEN DEBT SIR. AND OTHER AND OTHER IS GOING TO BE A LOT OF LEASE COSTS A QUICK MEANT IT'S OUR. SO TURNING TO THE NEXT PAGE ON PAGE NINE. TRANSITIONING TO THEFOURTH SECTION OF THIS PRESENTATION WE'RE TALK A BIT ABOUT OVERHEAD COSTS OR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS YOU CAN THINK OF IT AS A SMALL SUBSET ESSENTIALLY OF STATE OPERATIONS COSTS. THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS THAT ARE RELEVANT HERE THE FIRST IS FOR HEADQUARTERS OR PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION- AND THIS IS GOING TO BE THE COST OF PROVIDING CENTRALIZED SERVICES USUALLY AT A HEADQUARTERS IN SACRAMENTO OR ELSEWHERE IN THE STATE. WHICH DOES ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROGRAM POLICY OVERSIGHT THEY DEVELOP THE BUDGET FOR THE PROGRAM SUBMIT THAT BUDGET TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE LEGISLATURE- AND DO PROGRAM EVALUATION TO ASK QUESTIONS LIKE HOW WELL IS THIS PROGRAM WORKING AND HOW CAN IT WORK BETTER. THERE'S ALSO A NUMBER OF COSTS THAT TEND TO BE EMBEDDED IN A DEPARTMENTS- HEAD QUARTER LINE THAT CAN BE SORT OF. THAT OUR CENTRALIZED HOSPET TEND TO HAVE DISTRIBUTED BENEFITS SO FOR EXAMPLE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROJECTS. CAN BE PUT IN THIS CATEGORY BUT THEY MIGHT BE STILL RELATED TO DIRECT SERVICE PROVISION FOR PEOPLE SO THEY MIGHT STILL. HAVE SOME KIND OF PUBLIC INTERFACE- IT JUST REALLY DEPENDS ON HOW THE COSTS ARE CATEGORIZED. THE SECOND CATEGORY ACROSS WHICH IS MUCH SMALLER ARE STATEWIDE GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. AND THESE ARE COSTS THAT ARE PROVIDED BY CENTRALIZED STATE AGENCIES LIKE THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE OR THE STATE TREASURER. ESSENTIALLY LET'S TAKE THE EXAMPLE OF THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE THIS IS- AMOUNTS THAT ARE OR I'M SORRY ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN CENTRALIZED IN A SINGLE ENTITY THAT ARE PROVIDED ON BEHALF OF ALL DEPARTMENTS. FROM THE EXAMPLE OF THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE THEY RUN PAYROLL FOR ALL STATE DEPARTMENTS THEY ISSUE THE PAYCHECKS FOR ALL STATE DEPARTMENTS AND THEN STATE DEPARTMENTS WILL PAY FOR THAT SERVICE THROUGH THEIR BUDGET- AS YOU KNOW I TO SHARE DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH OF THAT SERVICE THEY'RE USING- THESE COSTS TEND TO BE QUITE LOW LESS THAN ONE PERCENT. OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT'S BUDGET. SO TRYING TO THE NAY PAGE. WE'RE JUST HERE PROVIDING SOMETHING'S. OF PLACES WHERE HEAD QUARTER COSTS IN PARTICULAR. HAD INCREASED FOR STATE DEPARTMENTS- OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND WE PICKED THE DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE SHOWN HERE BECAUSE THEY- HAD INCREASES THAT WERE LARGER IN DOLLAR TERMS. AS YOU CAN SEE ON THE CHART WE'VE GOT WE'RE COMPARING TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN- TOTAL ADMINISTRATIVE HEADQUARTERED MINISTRY OF COSTS TO TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. FOR EACH OF THESE FOUR DEPARTMENTS THE TWO ON THE LEFT ARSED PRIMARILY SPECIAL FUND FUNDED APARTMENTS IN THE TWO ON THE RIGHT. ARE PRIMARILY GENERAL FUND FUNDED DEPARTMENTS. AND. AND THEN THE TOP OF THE GRAPHIC SHOWS THE SHARE OF THAT DEPARTMENT'S HEADQUARTERS ACROSS AS A TOTAL OF THEIR PROGRAM COSTS AND THESE NUMBERS AREN'T NECESSARILY DIRECTLY- COMPARABLE TO ONE ANOTHER YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE DMB IS 10% VERSUS DDS AS 1% AND THAT'S BECAUSE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS HAVE DIFFERENT PRACTICES WITH REGARD TO WHAT THEY CATEGORIZE AS HEAD QUARTER RELATED COSTS. BUT AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE TOP OF THE- THE GRAPHIC GENERALLY HIGH COURT ACROSS TEND TO BE A SMALL SHARE OF THE PROGRAM'S OVERALL COSTS. SO THE FINAL PAGE OF THE HANDOUT- PROVIDE JUST WALKS THROUGH SOME REASONS WHY THESE COSTS HAVE INCREASED AMONG THESE DEPARTMENTS IN RECENT YEARS I'M ALL. YOU KNOW KIND OF GO OVER ALL THESE POINTS- ONE BY ONE SINCE THERE ARE A LOT IN THERE ALREADY IN YOUR HAND UP IT JUST WANTED TO TOUCH ON A COUPLE OF THEMES THAT ARE. TRUE ACROSS THESE DEPARTMENTS AND SOME OTHERS IN THE STATE. SO ONE OF THEM IS I. T. PROJECTS I. T. PROJECTS- CAN BE. THE COST OF WHICH CAN BE BOOKED AT YOU KNOW THE HEAD QUARTER LEVEL EVEN IF THAT I. T. PROJECT IS. IS REALLY ABOUT SERVICE DELIVERY SO ONE EXAMPLE IS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS THEY'RE UNDERGOING AN I. T. PROJECTS TO IMPROVE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD SYSTEM. AND THAT WILL OBVIOUSLY IMPROVE. YOU KNOW COULD COULD HELP TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE BUT IT'S BOOKED AS I HEADQUARTERED CROSSED. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS FOR THE DMV- THEY'RE UNDERGOING SOME EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THEIR WEBSITE. AND IMPROVE CHATBOT IMPLEMENTATION FOR THE PUBLIC TO BE ABLE TO- COMMUNICATE WITH DMV EMPLOYEES. AND THOSE ARE ALSO CONSIDERED HEADQUARTERS COSTS OF THOSE ARE ALL CONTRIBUTING TO THOSE INCREASES IN COSTS. THE SECOND GAME IS ABOUT HEADQUARTER RELOCATION. A FEW OF THESE APARTMENTS ARE RELOCATING THEIR HEADQUARTERS FOR- RELATED REASONS MOST OF THEM ARE BECAUSE THE BUILDINGS THAT THE HEADQUARTERS ARE CURRENTLY HOUSED AND HAVE. HAD SOME STRUCTURAL ISSUES OR SOME OTHER KINDS OF HABITABILITY ISSUES FOR EXAMPLE LEAKING PIPES LEAKING WINDOWS- LEAKING BALCONIES INTO- OFFICES BELOW. AND THOSE PROBLEMS. I HAVE- AS A RESULT- LED THE STATE TO RELOCATE THERE AND PULL THOSE EMPLOYEES TO OTHER LOCATIONS IN SACRAMENTO- THOSE EFFORTS ARE GENERALLY UNDER WAY AND SO. AND IN SOME CASES ARE ALMOST FINISHED OUT SO WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE AN QUESTIONS OR TURN IT OVER TO. THANK YOU WE DON'T AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY FROM OHIO. GOT A FINANCE ANY FEEDBACK OR COMMENT. I KNOW THANK YOU TO THE L. A. O. FOR SUCH A NICE DOCUMENTS- NO WE ARE JUST HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU RESEARCH. BY THE- I'VE- FIVE. THANK YOU I GONNA TURN OVER TO OUR OF MY SOLDIER DO YOU ANY QUESTIONS. YES THANK YOU. I'M OKAY SO GOING TO. THE YOUR FIRST AID OR TALK ABOUT THAT THE TREND IN THE STATE BUDGET. THIS THAT THEY AND STATE SPENDING BOTH IT FOR POINT FIVE PER A YEAR THE LAST DECADE. SUIT SO ARE STATE SPENDING HAS AND BY 55% IN THE LAST DECADE IS THAT. ACCURATE NO JUST FIVE AND A HALF ANNUAL AVERAGE GROWTH. SO FIVE FIVE POINT FIVE PERCENT. I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD DO THAT ARE YOU ASKING FOR THE COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH. YEAH I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN GET I'M SORRY I CAN'T DO THAT. MATH IN MY HEAD. WITH. ONE YEAH SO IT'S AROUND SO IT'S AROUND A FIFTY IT'S AROUND A 50% GROWTH IN SPENDING. I'M AND I GUESS WHAT I'M WHAT I'M TRYING TO WRAP MY HEAD AROUND IS. TIED INTO IF ALL THINGS WITH ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL SO AND OBVIOUSLY SOME OF THAT SPENDING HAS BEEN DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN SERVICES BUT- IF ALL THINGS WERE EQUAL HOW MUCH WOULD WE HAVE EXPECTED. ARE SPENDING TO HAVE GROWN OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST TEN YEARS. LIKE IF WE LOOK AT THE POPULATION GROWTH AND AT THE RATE OF INFLATION. YEAH ACTUALLY I. EXPECTED IT TO BE. SURE IT'S NOT HERE- BUT ACTUALLY IF YOU DO THIS GRAPH JUST RELATIVE TO THE STATE'S POPULATION AND INFLATION USING THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX THEN YOU GOT A PRETTY SIMILAR RESULT THAT- IN REAL TERMS THE STATE SPENDING HAS BEEN ESSENTIALLY FLAT OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES. I'M OKAY. GIVE ME DOUBLE CHECK THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE AVERAGE SO I AM PRETTY SURE THE AVERAGE INFLATION RATE OVER THE COURSE OF. THE LAST DECADE IS LIKE ONE POINT 77% AND OUR POPULATION GROWTH HAS BEEN SOMETHING LIKE. JOINT 7% SO I THINK THAT. IF SERVICES WERE WERE HELD EQUAL I AM PRETTY SURE THAT OUR STATE SPENDING PER YEAR WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE LIKE TWO POINT 4% GROWTH AS OPPOSED TO FIVE POINT 5% GROWTH. I DON'T HAVE SOMEBODY LOOK AT THE U. S. CAN LIKE FACT CHECK THOSE NUMBERS ARE ARE DO THAT DO THAT QUICKLY I JUST THINK WOULD BE USEFUL TO UNDERSTAND KIND OF THE BASELINE BECAUSE CLEARLY IF OUR STATE SPENDING IS GROWING AT A RATE THAT IS MUCH HIGHER THAN. POPULATION AND INFLATION. WE SHOULD BE SEEN IN A PRE. AND REALLY MEANINGFUL INCREASE IN SERVICES FOR. THAT ADDITIONAL SPENDING AND MAYBE WE ARE BUT I THINK IT JUST WOULD BE USEFUL FOR ALL OF US HAVE A BASS LINE ON WHAT WOULD EVEN HAVE BEEN IN IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW TWENTY TWENTY COMPARED TO TWENTY TO. SURE YEAH I'M HAPPY TO- CHECK ON THE NUMBERS FOR YOU I THINK IT IT PARTLY DEPENDS ON WHEN INFLATION INDEX YOU USE SO. THEIR INFLATION INDEX THE INDICES FOR EXAMPLE THERE CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC VERSUS NATIONAL THE NATIONAL ONES TEND TO BE LOWER THAN THE CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC. AND SO YEAH. OKAY GET THAT WOULD JUST BE GREAT FOR ME JUST KIND OF GROUND. LIKE WHAT I'M COMPARING SUBJECTS I THINK. IN SOME CASES IT IT DOES MAKE SENSE TO COMPARE. SPENDING GROWTH. TO AT THE GROWTH OF OUR- BUT IN IN MANY CASES THAT ACTUALLY MAKES MORE SENSE LOOK AT LIKE PUTS THE GROWTH THE POPULATION- THAT THE GROWTH THE SERVICES SO THAT WE CAN REALLY WRAP OUR ARMS AROUND. WHERE ARE WE GETTING VALUE FOR MONEY RIGHT. I'M I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS BUT IF PEOPLE OTHER PEOPLE OF JAPAN OKAY AND THEN LET ME SEE ON AS- IT'S ARE YOU MAY HAVE HAVE SPOKEN TO THIS WHEN YOU'RE GOING THROUGH YOUR PRESENTATION WHICH BY THE WAY I THINK THIS IS. I JUST I THINK THAT THE WAY THAT YOU'VE PRESENTED THIS IS AWESOME LIKE APPS WE LOVE THIS PRESENTATION ON THE CHARTS I'M SICK THANK YOU FOR THAT. I ON PEACH FOR WHAT IS WHAT IS BUSINESS AND LABOR. SHE TO THAT TRANSPORTATION AND BUSINESS AND LABOR. YES THIS IS A LOT OF OUR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND I'M PROGRAMS. ARE USUALLY FUNDED THROUGH PAYROLL FOR EXAMPLE OR- CHARGES ON EMPLOYERS AND THEN- THE SENATE AND FEDERAL FUNDS AS WELL. OKAY THANKS AND. I WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE IF NOT RIGHT NOW AT SOME POINT AS FOLLOW UP ON PAGE EIGHT. I'M YOU'VE GOT CONSENT INSISTED OPERATIONS BY AGENCY AND THE OTHER IS A PRETTY BIG CHUNK OF THAT. YES POSSIBLE FOR US TO GET A BREAK DOWN OF THAT IT TO GET A LITTLE MORE GRANULARITY BEHIND NOT ONE. YES ABSOLUTELY I DO WE DIDN'T DO IT IN THIS GRAPHIC BECAUSE THE SLICES WOULD JUST GET SO SMALL. BUT I ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO DO THAT. I'M AND THEN. AT THE AS THE OTHER GRAPH COMPONENTS OF STATE OPERATIONS COSTS WHAT IS IN THE OTHER POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS CHALK. THIS IS IT NEARLY ALL OUR RETIREE HEALTH BENEFITS FOR RETIRED STUDENT HE'S. BUT THAT'S OKAY AND THAT'S DIFFERENT. THEN. TO PLACE ALIRIZA BENEFITS. YES AT EMPLOYEE SALARIES AND BENEFITS MOSTLY IT'S JUST SALARY COSTS AND PENSION RELATED COSTS AND THEN OPEB IS FOR- HEALTH- RELATED COSTS FOR RETIREES OKAY AND THEN REMIND ME WHAT IS WHAT WAS THAT NUMBER FOR TWENTY I WHICH THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET AS ENACTED. FOR A PAD YEAH IT'S ROUGHLY TWO POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS I BELIEVE BUT I MIGHT BE REMEMBER NOT WRONG SO- LET ME GET BACK TO YOU ON IT. OKAY THOSE ARE MY QUESTIONS IN TERMS OF THIS DOCUMENT. BUT FULLER QUESTIONS. THE DOCTOR DOCTOR REBEL. SURE FIRST OF ARE WITH YOU AND I JUST APPRECIATE THE L. A. O. BEING COMMON OBJECTIVE NOW FOR US TO BE TO HAVE THE AND SO REALLY WANT TO DO YOU A FEW OF THE GRASS OF LIKE I'M GONNA START ON PAGE TO SO YOU'RE FOLLOWING ALONG AS WELL. AND I'VE WANT TO LOOK THE EXTREMES OF BOTH SIDES IF I CAN SO FIRST I WOULD HIGHLIGHT THAT THE STATE HAS BEEN SPENDING MORE MONEY ON CALIFORNIA OR THAN ANY OTHER PROGRAM IN THE LAST DECADE AND HAS OUR STATE IS ON FIRE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO RECOGNIZE THE INVESTMENTS WE'VE MADE ADDRESSED THIS HEAD ON. INTO AREAS LIKE THAT BUT I WOULD ALSO LOOK TOWARDS THE LEFT SIDE OF THAT GRAPH WHERE WE NOTICED BOTH SS I SS P. AS WELL AS CAL RECYCLED BEING AREAS WE HAVE NOT FUNDED WELL AND AS WE LOOK TOWARDS OUR SOCIAL SAFETY NET TENTH THOSE WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE IT IS THOSE WHO ARE ON A FIXED INCOMES WILL NEED OUR SUPPORT NOW AND I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THEIR PLIGHT DURING THIS RECESSION. BUT WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT CAL RECYCLE HUNT THE RESPONSIBILITIES WERE ALSO LOOKING FOR THEM TO TAKE ON AND SO WOULD JUST REMEMBER THAT OVER THE LAST DECADE AGAIN THEY HAVE NOT BEEN AS WELL FUNDED AS MANY OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS IN OUR STATE I NOW WOULD LIKE TO IF I CAN SPEND THE BULK OF MY TIME WITH YOU ON PAGE SEVEN JUST SO YOU'RE FOLLOWING ALONG AGAIN. AND REALLY TALK ABOUT THE PHONE MIX AND FUNCTION BY AGENCY AND DEPARTMENT AND I'M GOING TO TALK TO ABOUT THREE. THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THE JUDICIAL BRANCH AND THEN. RESOURCES AND RECYCLING. SO FIRST OF WE CAN TALK ABOUT DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WE SEE THAT THERE ARE ROUGHLY EQUALLY SPLIT ON FUNDING BETWEEN LOCAL AND- STATE OPERATIONS. AND I'M WONDERING IF YOU COULD HELP TO ELABORATE WHAT THE RESPONSIBILITIES ARE. HOW DO YOU DETERMINE WHICH ARE FUNDED BY LOCAL ASSISTANCE IN WHICH OUR STATE OPERATIONS AND- HAS THAT CHANGED OVER THE LAST DECADE. THANK YOU I'M GONNA TURN THIS OVER ACTUALLY TO MY COLLEAGUE CAROLINE CHU WHO- PROBABLY CAN PROVIDE YOU A BIT MORE DETAIL THAN I CAN. GOOD AFTERNOON CAROLINE SHE WITH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I CAN PRIVATE A BIT MORE INSIGHT ON THE MY CALLING WAS A COLLEAGUE MISS HOLLINGSHEAD THOUGH WE ALSO CAN FOLLOW UP WITH YOU DOCTOR ARAMBULA. I'M AS YOU KNOW THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAS GRANTS. OR IS LARGELY GRANTS- FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR SPECIAL FUNDS FOR SPECIFIC PROGRAMS IN SPECIFIC TYPES OF FOR HELP PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS- LIKE FOR TOBACCO USE AND NOT SORT OF THING AND THEN IT ALSO HAS GRANTS THAT IT. PASSES DOWN TO THE LOCAL LEVEL. I WE COULD OF COURSE- PROVIDE YOU FURTHER BREAK OUT BETWEEN THOSE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES AND WHAT SPECIFICALLY EACH OF THOSE CATEGORIES IS ADDRESSING. AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE OVER THE LAST DECADE IN TERMS OF THE RELATIVE NEXT WE HAVE TO LOOK BACK AT SOME HISTORICAL OUT BUDGET DOCUMENTS. ABOUT THAT AND BUT THE PERHAPS A DIFFERENT FINANCE HAS A LITTLE BIT OF- OR MIGHT BE ABLE. TO OFFER A LITTLE MORE DETAIL AT THIS TIME. FINANCES UNABLE TO RUN HARDLY THREE FIFTY FOR THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE I'M GONNA TURN THIS OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE AND JACKS. OF ALL. THAT'S ALL PART OF FINANCE- IN TERMS OF. THE SPLIT BETWEEN THE LOCAL SYSTEMS AND- STATE OPERATIONS FUNDING EVERITT IS LARGELY DRIVEN BY THE- REQUIREMENTS OF FEDERAL GRANTS. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROVIDES A LOT OF TV JUST FUNDING NOT FUNDING IS A SPLIT BETWEEN LOCAL ASSISTANCE WHICH IS YOU KNOW FUNDING THAT GOES OUT TO EITHER THE HEALTH RESTRICTIONS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS OR OTHER- DRUG PROVIDERS IN COMMUNITIES. AND THEN THERE'S A PORTION FOR THE STATE TO EITHER ASSIST OR OR DO A STATEWIDE PROGRAM IT'S REALLY A CASE BY CASE BASIS BY BY GRANT. IN ON THE SPECIAL SIDE. THE KNOW THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT RANGE OF USES I THINK THE PH STANDS OUT OF ABOUT SIXTY SPECIAL FUNDS RANGING FROM TOBACCO DEPARTMENT HEALTH TO AIDS DRUG ASSISTANCE SO IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE PROGRAM IT'S THAT IT'S A VERY BROAD AND DIVERSE POOL FUNDS AND- ISSUES THAT THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH MINISTERS. SELL OUT SOME MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK OUT WITH THAT PROJECT WITH EUROSTAT PROBE OR WHOMEVER. TO GET TO THAT TO TELL YOU SEE. I'M SURE MYSELF WOULD LOVE TO FOLLOW UP IF I CAN TAKE IT A STEP FURTHER AND TELL YOU SOME OF THE DETAIL THAT I'M LOOKING FOR THOUGH- I'LL HIGHLIGHT PROP FIFTY SIX AS AN EXAMPLE- CURRENTLY THAT. FUND IS- ABLE TO BE ALLOCATED FOR OUR LOCALS TO BE ABLE TO SPEND. I BELIEVE THERE NEEDS TO BE BETTER ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT OVER HOW THOSE FUNDS ARE BEING SPENT- AT THE MOMENT SOME OF THOSE FUNDS CAN GO TOWARDS ACTIVITIES THAT OUR SHERIFFS ARE. PERFORMING AND BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THOSE FUNDS ARE DEDICATED TOWARDS THOSE INTENDED PURPOSES LIKE SMOKING CESSATION. OUR GOAL HERE IS ACTUALLY TO GET SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS AND- MORE PEOPLE OUT HELPING TO EDUCATE OUR TEENS. AND JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING AND HAVING THE APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT OVER THESE PROGRAMS. SO WOULD LOVE TO FOLLOW UP IF I CAN ON PUBLIC HEALTH SPECIFICALLY LOOKING AT MANY OF THE DEDICATED FUNDS. TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE GOING TOWARDS THEIR INTENDED PURPOSES. BUT ALONG THOSE LINES I DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT CRIMINAL JUSTICE IS I BELIEVE A- LARGE PART OF OUR COMMUNITY HAS REALLY WANTED TO STAND UP AND SPEAK ABOUT THIS ISSUE SO WOULD LIKE TO TAK ABOUT THE JUDICIAL BRANCH OF. I CAN WHICH WAS. JOINT ABOUT HALF WAY DOWN THAT GRAPH. AND IF I'M READING THIS CORRECTLY IT APPEARS THAT THE JUDICIAL BRANCH IS PREDOMINANTLY FUNDED BY LOCAL ASSISTANCE. IN THE FORM READING THE RIGHT PARAGRAPH OF TWENTY ONE BILLION. IT SEEMS THAT THREE QUARTERS OF THAT TWENTY ONE BILLION LOOKS TOWARDS. GOING TOWARDS LOCAL ASSISTANCE I WOULD READ THAT AS SAYING SIXTEEN BILLIONGIVE OR TAKE. IS WHAT WE ARE SENDING DOWN TO OUR LOCALS AND SO I'D LIKE TO ASK THAT FIRST QUESTION IF I COULD TOWARDS THE L. A. O. WHAT ARE THE LOCAL RESPONSIBILITIES THAT WE ARE PASSING DOWN TO. OUR JUDICIAL BRANCH. WHAT IS IT THAT WE'RE FUNDING WITH THOSE FUNDS. AND START WITH THAT. YEAH THANK YOU DOCTOR REGULAR WILL HAVE TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU FOR MORE DETAIL ON THIS PROGRAM BECAUSE- WE HAVE ONLY A FEW NUMBER OF STAFF HERE TODAY AND NONE OF US KNOW THE JUDICIAL BRANCH IN DETAIL- BUT I WILL SAY THAT THE LOCAL ASSISTANCE FUNDS ARE THOSE FUNDS THAT ARE- FOR. COURT SYSTEMS THAT ARE LOCALLY ADMINISTERED AND- I DO APPRECIATE AND I'M HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP I WOULD. HIGHLIGHT IF I COULD- THE NATIONAL I'VE BEEN PORING OVER A DOCUMENT THE L. A. O. GAVE TO US THAT EVALUATED THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FUNDING OF OUR PUBLIC DEFENDERS AND OUR DISTRICT ATTORNEYS I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF A CONVERSATION WE WILL NEED TO HAVE NEXT YEAR. ABOUT HOW WE ENSURE THAT THE SCALES OF JUSTICE ARE BALANCED IN OUR EQUAL AND SO AS WE'RE HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT IS BEING FUNDED BY THE LOCALS AND PAID FOR BY THE STATE. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO WORK TOWARDS WHAT SHOULD BE JUSTICE AND THE SCALES OF JUSTICE I'M NO LAWYER BUT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE EQUAL AND% THAT SHOULD MEAN YOU'RE HAVING EQUAL RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR THAT. SO WHAT I APPRECIATE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT THAT REPORT FINALLY IF I CANNOT JUST OPINE IF LIKE CAN SAY THAT MUCH OF A HAS BEEN MADE ABOUT OUR NEED AS THE STATE'S TO FOCUS ON RECYCLING. BUT I SEE A PREDOMINANCE OF THE RESOURCE RECYCLING AND RECOVERY TO BE PUMPED TO BE FUNDED BY OUR LOCALS AND WAS HOPING YOU COULD SPEAK AGAIN ABOUT THE RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE LOCALS AND WHERE THE- FUNDING IS- AND- HOW THEY HELP TO- US TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM AS A STATE YES. THANK YOU DOCTOR EMILY JUST ONE CLEAR. THE LOCAL ASSISTANCE HERE IS ACTUALLY MONEY THAT THE STATE IS GIVING TO LOCAL ENTITIES TO RUN THE PROGRAM NOT MONEY THAT THE STATE IS RECEIVING FROM LOCALS- WE DON'T HAVE. LOCAL GOVERNMENT FUNDING ON THIS CHART BUT IF IT WOULD BE HELPFUL HAPPY TO TRY TO- GET THOSE NUMBERS AS WELL. I DO APPRECIATE IN AGAIN JUST LIKE I STARTED HAVE ALWAYS. FELT THAT THE ALEJO'S DONE A GREAT JOB FOR THOSE OF US WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE- I WILL LEND MY COMMENTS TODAY I SAW THE CSU ON THERE AND I SEE OUR CHAIR OF HIGHER EDUCATION IS- A SUB TWO IS HERE AS WELL- THERE WAS A RECENT HIGHER THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MADE AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO APPRECIATE AND ACKNOWLEDGE WE HAVE THE FIRST NATIVE CALIFORNIAN. AND MEXICAN AMERICAN CHANCELLOR OF RCS USE THE. LARGEST PUBLIC UNIVERSITY AND OUR NATION AND I'M QUITE PROUD THAT CASH IS NOW THAT CHANCELLOR AND WHAT ONE WITH KNOWLEDGE ALL OF THOSE WHO ARE ON THE BOARD AS WELL AS- THE ADMINISTRATION FOR MAKING THAT HIGHER IT'S A BIG STEP FORWARD FOR OUR STATE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. YEAH LET ME JUST REITERATE I THINK WHAT YOU JUST SAID THAT DR GRANT I THINK DR. CASTRO WAS AMAZING ARE I THINK HE'S THE RIGHT PERSON AT THE RIGHT TIME AND I THINK YOUR FOR. YOUR LOSS IS THE STATE'S GAME AND- I UNDERSTAND NO FRESNO STATE TO START TO SEE HIM GO BUT- THE SYSTEM IS GONNA BE BETTER FOR AND HE'S A- HE'S BEEN AMAZING ADMINISTRATOR- AND- HE'S GONNA DO A PHENOMENAL JOB SO JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT. MR FONG. WITH I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I WANT SOME OF MY QUESTIONS IN TERMS OF- I GUESS THE BUDGET A RELATIONSHIP WITH THEECONOMY- CERTAINLY OUR OUR BUDGET HEALTH IS TIED TO OUR ECONOMIC HEALTH SO ARE THERE ANY PROJECTIONS OR INITIAL PROJECTIONS RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF WHAT OUR GENERAL FUND WILL LOOK LIKE- NEXT YEAR- CERTAINLY WE ARE IN A IN IN A AND NO THROWS A VERY DEEP RECESSION. AND LOOKING INTO THE NEXT TAX YEAR WITH MANY CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVEN'T WORKED FOR NINE MONTHS AND BUSINESSES WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO REOPEN- WHAT DOES KIND OF OUR GENERAL FUND OUTLOOK LOOK LIKE. YEAH AND SO OUR OFFICE IS ACTUALLY CURRENTLY JUST STARTING OUR NOVEMBER FISCAL OUTLOOK PROCESS WHICH- IS THE ANNUAL REPORT THAT WE PROVIDE TO THE LEGISLATURE IN NOVEMBER OF EACH YAR- GIVING AN OVERVIEW FOR THE BUDGETS CONDITION OUR OUR VIEW OF THE BUDGETS CONDITION FOR THE UPCOMING YEAR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO- AND THEN THE MULTI YEAR. SO I DON'T HAVE ANY- RESULTS FROM THAT REPORT YET TO SHARE WITH YOU ALTHOUGH OF COURSE AND WE WILL SHARE THOSE RESULTS WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN WITH YOU- THAT WHEN THAT REPORT IS RELEASED BUT I CAN ALSO SAY THAT. YOU KNOW JUST LOOKING AT THE TAX REVENUE COLLECTIONS TO DATE FOR THE CURRENT YEAR. OUR REVENUE COLLECTIONS THROUGH THE END OF MARCH OR AHEAD OF PROJECTIONS IN THE BUDGET AX BY ABOUT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN SEPTEMBER WELL WE ONLY HAVE PRELIMINARY DATA SO FAR- IT IS LOOKING ALSO LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE SIMILARLY STRONG AND AHEAD OF PROJECTIONS WITHHOLDING FOR EXAMPLE HAS REMAINED PRETTY STRONG IN TWENTY TWENTY SURPRISINGLY PERHAPS- COMPARED TO TWENTY NINETEEN. AND SO WHILE CERTAINLY THE STATE COULD FACE ANOTHER BUDGET PROBLEM IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THE STATE EITHER WON'T HAVE ANYWHERE NEAR AS LARGE OF A BUDGET PROBLEM AT TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO THAT IT HAD IN THIS YEAR. OR THAT IT MIGHT EVEN NOT HAVE A BUDGET PROBLEM IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO SO THAT'LL BE AN IMPORTANT- QUESTION AN ASSESSMENT THAT WE WILL BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION ON ONCE WE FINISH THAT NOVEMBER OUTLOOK. I WOULD I GUESS I APPRECIATE YOUR OPTIMISM BUT D. I DON'T DO YOU HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT WE WILL BUDGET SITUATION NEXT YEAR. NO NOT AT ALL- WE VERY WELL COULD SEE A BUDGET PROBLEM NEXT YEAR IT WAS JUST IT MEANT MERELY I WAS TRYING TO SAY THAT IT'S NOT A CERTAINTY THAT WE WILL SEE A BUDGET PROBLEM NEXT YEAR OR THAT IF WE DO SEE ABOUT YOUR PROBLEM. THERE IS IT YOU KNOW OKAY OKAY SHE GOT VERY GOOD CHANCE THAT IT WON'T BE AS BAD AS THE IS THIS HUGE FIFTY FOUR HISTORICAL BIT FIFTY FOUR BILLION HISTORIC BUDGET PROBLEM THAT WE HAD IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. SURE IT'S ARE AT ALL RELATIVE I MEAN HOPEFULLY IT'S- NOT AS BAD AS FIFTY FOUR BILLION BUT- IF IT'S- THIRTY EIGHT BILLION THAT'S STILL PRETTY. A DIFFICULT- BUT- IN TERMS OF- BUT YOU DO ACKNOWLEDGE THE FACT THAT. THERE IS A NEED I GUESS TO FOCUS ON. GROWING THE ECONOMY. AND TO ADDRESS. A LOT OF OUR BUDGET BUDGETARY CONCERNS. THAT'S TRUE YEAH I THINK WHAT OUR OFFICE WOULD SAY IN TERMS OF THE ROLE OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT IS THAT THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY FOR THE STATE GOVERNMENT TO IMPROVE THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK FOR THE STATE IS REALLY IN- CONTROLLING THE VIRUS AND ALLOWING THE STATE ECONOMY TO RE OPEN IN THAT AVENUE BECAUSE THE STATE CONSTITUTION PREVENTS THE STATE FROM DEFICIT SPENDING SIMILAR TO HOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN DO SO IT'S PRETTY DIFFICULT FOR THE STATE TO DO WHAT YOU THINK OF THIS CLASSIC STIMULUS SPENDING. BUT RATHER THAT THE STATE'S STRENGTHS ARE REALLY AND YOU KNOW IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEMAND BUT THEN ALSO IN MITIGATING VIA FAX THE ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC IN THE ENSUING RECESSION FOR SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS FOR BUSINESSES IN A TARGETED WAY. THE L. A. O. HAVE ANY. PERSPECTIVE IN TERMS OF HOW THE STATE. COULD PROVIDE MORE CERTAINTY I GUESS TO BUSINESSES I MEAN CERTAINLY. WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT WE NEED TO GET. WE HAVE A PUBLIC HEALTH CHALLENGE AND WE NEED TO GET CODED UNDER CONTROL BUT- HOW DO YOU. I HAVE MY I GUESS MY QUESTION IS WE HAVE TO DO BOTH AT THE SAME TIME KOBE DOES EXIST IN OUR SOCIETY. AND AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE TRYING TO BALANCE PUBLIC HEALTH WITH. THE REALITY OF JUST THE REAL WORLD. SELL EACH IS A DO YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS IN TERMS OF HOW DO YOU PROVIDE CERTAINTY FOR BUSINESSES AND INDUSTRIES TRYING TO RE OPEN. YEAH I MEAN I AGAIN I THINK OUR PERSPECTIVE IS THAT THE STATE CAN PROVIDE TARGETED ASSISTANCE OR PLACES WHERE THE STATE CAN COMPLEMENT EFFORTS THAT ARE ONGOING BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN THESE AREAS SO FOR EXAMPLE IN THE MOST RECENT BUDGET THERE WAS THE HIRING TAX CREDIT THE PROVIDED A THOUSAND DOLLARS PER INDIVIDUAL HIRED- YEAH- AT IN A CERTAIN TIME FRAME THERE'S ALSO SMALL BUSINESS LOANS THAT WERE AUTHORIZED BY THE GOVERNOR. THAT WERE INTENDED TO TARGET BUSINESSES THAT WERE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM THE FEDERAL PROGRAM- AND THESE KINDS OF EFFORTS ARE EXAMPLES OF PLACES WHERE THE STATE CAN PERHAPS COMPLEMENT THE FEDERAL EFFORT BUT CERTAINLY CAN. UNDERTAKE THE SAME KIND OF FINANCIAL PRESENCE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN. OKAY IN IN TERMS OF- IN TERMS OF YOUR CHARTS AND- AND THE SPENDING EXPENDITURES THAT YOU HIGHLIGHTED. ARE THERE ANY TRENDS THAT CONCERNED THE L. A. L. OR THEIR TRENDS THAT WE SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON. ARE THERE TARGETED REDUCTIONS THAT YOU WOULD SUGGEST OR THEIR EXPENDITURES THAT. THAT WE AS A STATE SHOULD NOT BE MAKING OR TO RE EVALUATE. YOU KNOW. OBVIOUSLY THAT'S A VERY SWEEPING QUESTIONING CAN REALLY DEPEND ON THE INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM I AM. I THINK THAT IT'S REALLY IT'S A CASE BY CASE BASIS AND OUR OFFICE IS ALWAYS HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND HOW KIND OF HELP THINK ABOUT WHAT IS THE MISSION OF EACH DEPARTMENT IS THAT DEPARTMENT MISSION REALLY WHAT THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO GET OUT OF IT- IS THE PROGRAM FUNDING LEVEL FOR THAT MISSION APPROPRIATE. AND YOU KNOW THOSE ARE CERTAINLY QUESTIONS THAT WE ASK EVERY YEAR AS PART OF OUR ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS AND WILL CONTINUE TO ASK- I DON'T HAVE ANY YOU KNOW SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD BUT ALSO HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU IF. YOU'RE LOOKING FOR MORE INFORMATION ON SPECIFIC PROGRAM I MEAN I'LL UNDERSTATEMENT ME AYE AYE THERE'S NO SECRET THAT I HAVE BY MY ISSUES WITH THAT HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM AND THE L. A. O. AS PREVIOUSLY NOTED. THAT THE STATE SHOULD PROBABLY NOT MOVE FORWARD OR OR IF THE STATE DOES MOVE FORWARD WITH ENTERING INTO LIKE A THIRTY YEAR MAINTENANCE CONTRACT. THAT THAT LOCKS IN- AS HE NEVER MET SPENDING MOVING FORWARD. SO I MEAN SOMETHING LIKE THAT I GUESS WOULD BE HOW WAS THAT REFLECTED IN YOUR CHARTS. YEAH SO HIGH SPEED RAIL IS A COMBINATION FUNDED. IS COMBINATION FUNDED WITH FEDERAL FUNDS AND THEN MAINLY GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND- CERTAINLY THEIR ISSUES YOU KNOW WITHIN THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND YOU CAN ALLOCATE THOSE FINDINGS TO DIFFERENT AMOUNTS HIGH SPEED RAIL IS ONE OF THEM. I'M SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THE STATE THOUGH PULLED BACK MONEY FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL ASSOCIATED WITH GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND THAT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY ADDRESS THE BUDGET PROBLEM WHICH IS A GENERAL FUND PROBLEM- ALSO. YOU KNOW SORT OF A NOTE OF CAUTION ON THAT IS THAT THE- FEDERAL FUNDING PROVIDED TO DATE IS ABOUT THREE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. AND IF THE STATE YOU KNOW- TOOK SPECIFIC ACTIONS AROUND HIGH SPEED RAIL THAT JEOPARDIZE. THAT FUTURE THAT FEDERAL FUNDING BECAUSE OF CHANGES TO THE AGREEMENT THAT THE STATE HAS MADE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THERE'S CHANCES THAT THAT MONEY WOULD NEED TO BE REPAIRED SO OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A VERY DELICATE ISSUE AND IT'S NOT MY- A PARTICULAR PROGRAM AREA WE'VE NOW EXHAUSTED MY KNOWLEDGE OF HIGH SPEED RAIL- BUT- YOU KNOW WHAT. FOR FURTHER QUESTIONS HAPPY TO REFER YOU TO THE STAFF WITHIN OUR OFFICE AND I MEAN TO PUT YOU ON THE SPOT I JUST IT'S ONE OF TOSE. THOSE GUYS. AGREE JUST EXAMPLES OF STATE EXPENDITURES THAT I THINK AND WE THE LEGISLATURE. ARE GRAPPLING WITH. I DO LOVE I DO APPRECIATE. YOUR THE INFORMATION YOU PROVIDED. CERTAINLY MY PERSONAL VIEW IS THAT. YOU KNOW. WE IN A WORLD OF OBVIOUSLY GIVEN A KIND OF A FALSE CHOICE THAT WE GOING TO DO THIS OR THAT WE GOTTA DO YOU. PUBLIC HEALTH ARE WE GOING TO PROTECT THE ECONOMY BY I THINK WE ARE CHALLENGED TO HAVE TO DO BOTH. AND SO. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AS WE'RE DEALING WITH THE WITH THE BUDGET AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IMPORTANT INVESTMENTS. I THINK WE DO HAVE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO- SAFELY- REOPEN THE ECONOMY WILL CONTROLLING COVE IT AND THAT MEANS THAT WE GOT TO GIVE BUSINESSES CERTAINTY. I DO BELIEVE THAT WE PROBABLY NEED TO FREEZE TAXES AND FEES WHERE THEY ARE AND GIVE SMALL BUSINESSES THE CHANCE- TO RECOVER. AND I THINK MOVING FORWARD I DO BELIEVE THAT OUR BUDGET. WILL DECISIONS ARE GOING TO BE VERY DIRE. AND DIFFICULT NEXT YEAR AND SO WE NEED TO BEGIN HAVE TOUGH. THANK PROCESS WITHOUT A- THE CHAIR FOR PUTTING THE COMMITTEE HEARING TO. BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF A VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISPERTON I THANK YOU JUST WHAT FIRST OF ALL THIS IS VERY HELPFUL FOR THE OVERALL BUDGET DISCUSSION BECAUSE WHETHER IT'S OUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY LAWMAKERS AND EIGHTY IN THE ASSEMBLY OUR CONSTITUENTS YOU KNOW THEY'RE ALWAYS ASKING WHY CAN'T WE CUT TAXES OR PUT MORE MONEY TO OUR SCHOOLS OUR MONEY FROM HIGH SPEED RAIL TO USE YOU SEE AND SO I THINK THIS IS A REALITY AS FAR AS WHERE THE MONEY GOES AND- WHERE IT'S WORKED WITH THE TRENDS ARE AND WHAT THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE SO- IT. I JUST HAVE A COUPLE MAYBE. NEW WANTS QUESTIONS IN AB ONE BIG BIG PICTURE. SO ONE THING IS I KNOW THAT MR ARAMBULA MENTIONED HIGHER EDUCATION WE DO LOVE OUR NEW. A CSU LEADER I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM THE UC BECAUSE ON THIS CHART IT SAYS THAT THE LAST DECADE. THE CSU. GROWTH HAS BEEN ABOUT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE ABOUT 8% AND THEN CSU. IS ABOUT FIVE AND WE USUALLY RY TO KEEP THEM. ROUGHLY EQUAL YOU KNOW IT'S KIND OF LIKE TWO SIBLINGS FIGHTING FOR GIFTS AT THE HOLIDAYS AND WANTS WANT PARITY. SO WHAT CAN YOU. EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE HERE WHAT CAN YOU DO TO EXPLAIN THIS. YEAH THERE WERE THERE WERE A FEW YEARS WHERE- BUDGET AUGMENTATIONS FOR UC AND CSU WERE PROVIDED. AT THE SAME DOLLAR LEVEL BUT THAT ACTUALLY REPRESENTED DIFFERENT PERCENTAGE LEVELS OF EACH OF THE EACH OF THEIR BUDGET SO NOW YOU SEE IN CSU'S TOTAL BUDGETS ARE ACTUALLY ROUGHLY THE SAME THEY'RE VERY CLOSE TO ONE ANOTHER BUT- A FEW YEARS AGO THAT WAS NOT THE CASE AND SO THE DOLLAR TERMS ESSENTIALLY HAD CSU CATCH UP TO YOU SEE. IN TERMS OF THEIR TOTAL BUDGET BUT IN PERCENTAGE TERMS IT WAS FASTER FOR CSU AND UC. OKAY AND THEN IF YOU LOOK AT THAT WHERE WE SPEND THE MAJORITY OF GENERAL FUND MONEY. IT'S CERTAINLY EDUCATION SO- PRODUCT SO THE PROP AND HATE SCHOOL EXPENDITURES UC AND CSU AND HEALTH CARE. SO IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE THAT THE ANNUAL GROWTH THE ON THE KAHNEMAN PAGE TO OF COURSE. SO THE OUTLINED AS FAR AS HEAVY SPENDING THE LAST DECADE. THIRD THERE NOT A LOT OF. ONE BIG DOLLAR AMOUNT BUDGET AREAS THANK THE HIGHER AT THE K. TWELVE IS. IT LOOKS LIKE. AND IT LOOKS LIKE ABOUT MEDIKAL. IS THAT THIS IS THAT THE TOTAL. OR JUST THE STATE PORTION. THIS IS JUST STATE MONEY SO GENERAL FUND AND SPECIAL ONES RIGHT IF YOU INCLUDED FEDERAL FUNDS MEDICAL WOULD BE GROWING MUCH FASTER SO FOR MEDICARE HOW THAT'S REALLY NOT THAT. A YOU KNOW A POLICY CHOICE THAT'S THAT'S CASELOAD RIGHT THAT'S RESPONDING TO WHAT'S HAPPENING IN FOR HELP NEEDS ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND- HILL. THE RURAL IRVINE CENTRAL VALLEY THE BAY AREA LA ALL OVER CALIFORNIA. THAT AS WELL AS JUST POPULATION GROWTH RIGHT. YEAH THE MAJOR DRIVERS OF- MEDICAL SPENDING R. ONE CHANGES IN POLICY SO OF COURSE WITH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND THEN THAT. OPTIONAL EXPANSION THAT WAS REALLY A BIG DRIVER OF TO MEDIKAL GENERAL FUND GROWTH OVER TIME FOR AS THE STATE MATCH FOR TOTAL FUNDING WENT DOWN IN THE PARKS RIGHT THIS SHOULD STATE MATCH WENT UP AND FEDERAL FUNDING ATCH WENT DOWN FOR THE OPTIONAL EXPANSION POPULATION- AND THEN THE SECOND BIG CATEGORIES OF COST AS YOU POINT OUT OUR CASELOAD UTILIZATION AND PRICES AND IN PARTICULAR PRICES CAN BE- A PRETTY DRIVING. COST FACTOR AS FOR EXAMPLE PHARMACEUTICAL COSTS HAVE GONE UP. YEAH AND THEN- WHEN YOU LOOK AT. THE OPPORTUNITIES POTENTIALLY TO MAKE OTHER EXPENDITURES IF WE HADN'T DIFFERENCE IF YOU LOOK AT. BUCKETS AND POTS OF RESOURCES WHERE WOULD YOU GO FIND. THOSE AND AGAIN I MEAN I KNOW THE ANSWER BUT HE COULD JUST REMIND US IS LIKE IF YOU WANTED TO. YOU KNOW IT CUT TAXES OR YOU KNOW FOCUS ON RESPONDING TO TWO COVETED FOR RENT RELIEF FOR PROGRAMS FOR WHAT PARTS OF THE BUDGET WOULD YOU TAKE FROM TO DO THAT. OKAY SO I THINK WHAT YOU'RE ASKING IS WHERE DOES THE LEGISLATURE HAVE FLEXIBILITY TO MAKE REDUCTIONS BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE ALWAYS HAS TO PASS A BALANCED BUDGET SO ANY TIME YOU KNOW ONE SPENDING INCREASE SPENDING IS INCREASED OR REVENUES ARE REDUCED- THAT IS SORT OF BY DEFINITION GOING TO HAVE TO MEAN THAT THE BUDGET HAS TO MAKE REDUCTIONS IN ANOTHER PLACE EITHER REVENUE INCREASE IN ANOTHER PLACE OR EXPENDITURE REDUCTION AND OTHER PLACES- THE LEGISLATURE IS QUITE CNSTRAINED IN MAKING REDUCTIONS IN CERTAIN AREAS OF THE BUDGET FOR EXAMPLE AROUND THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT. I REQUIREMENTS WHICH ARE CONSTITUTIONAL THE LEGISLATURE CAN ONLY SUSPEND THOSE WITH A TWO THIRDS VOTE AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS TO THERE'S NOT A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY BECAUSE A LOT OF THOSE PROGRAMS TEND TO BE FEDERAL AND STATE JOINT. FUNDED PROGRAMS IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REALLY HAS A LOTOF REQUIREMENTS AROUND THE STATE FOR- HOW IT CAN MAKE REDUCTIONS SO THE PLACES WHERE THE STATE TENDS TO HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY ARE IN THE UNIVERSITIES EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AND FOR THE COURT SYSTEM. YEAH AND THE REALLY THE ONLY TWO POTS WHERE THERE'S- A LOT OF MONEY OR THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM WITH GENERAL FUND. THANK I'M AN EMPLOYEE. WITH THE YOU KNOW STATES DOLLARS YES AND THOSE ARE NEGOTIATED CONTRACTS WE HAVE TO FUND RIGHT. THAT'S CORRECT. AT I DO WANT TO ASK ABOUT THE- THE DEBTS DEBT SERVICE IT IT SEEMS THAT. IT'S LIKE WHAT 3% OF THE GENERAL FUND. ANNUAL DEBT SERVICE- WHAT IS IT IT'S 3% GROWTH OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS I'M NOT SURE WHAT WHAT IS IT OF THE GENERAL FUND ABOUT IT I'M SORRY I DON'T KNOW THAT OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD CHRISTIAN IS IT LIKE. FIVE THE DEBT SERVICE IT WE ALWAYS SAY WE WANT TO KEEP IT AT A CERTAIN LEVEL WHEN WE THINK ABOUT PUTTING MORE BONDS ON THE BALLOT LIKE THE STENCIL BONNER THE EDUCATION BOND. SO I GUESS THE QUESTION IS THAT THERE'S BEEN. IDEAS ABOUT HOW WE COULD HAVE IT INFRASTRUCTURE BOND TO. FURTHER STIMULATE THE STATE ECONOMY TO LOOK AT. YOU KNOW- INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS ORDERS OR WORK FORCE- WHERE ARE WE AT AS FAR AS THE OVERALL. PORTION OF OUR STATE BUDGET THAT GOES TO DEBT SERVICE FOR. GEO BONDING AND WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL WHETHER THAT WERE AT- A LOAN OUT RIGHT NOW SO CONSIDER IT. OTHER BOND MEASURES IN THE FUTURE ANOTHER IS AT LEAST ONE OF THE BALLOT RIGHT NOW AND I THINK. ANOTHER IDEA TO PUT AN AD BOND BACK ON THE BALLOT. AFTER IT FAILED IN THE PRIMARY. YEAH I'M SORRY I DON'T I WISH I HAD THOSE NUMBERS OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD OR IN FRONT OF ME I DON'T BUT- I MIGHT ASK IF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE KNOWS. OKAY AND THEN LASTLY AS FAR AS THE- YEAH. IS THE US HAVE A HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT. HE LEADS THE RESIDENTS GET A DEPARTMENT FINANCE I ALSO DO NOT HAVE THAT INFORMATION WITH ME. I KNOW IT'S SOMETHING WE TALK ON A REGULAR BASIS I'M SURE. SOME OF THE POP UP IN A FEW SECONDS BUT LET ME JUST FLIP TO IT TO ANOTHER AS FAR AS THAT THE HEALTH BENEFITS FOR RETIREES THAT'S ALWAYS BROUGHT UP A LOT AS FAR AS- STATE OBLIGATIONS AND- YOU KNOW- LIABILITIES FOUR. FOUR HEAT. ESPECIALLY LOCAL GOVERNMENT BUT ALSO FOR STATE TO EVERYBODY IN THE FUTURE- DO WE ANTICIPATE THAT TO REMAIN. RELATIVELY STEADY OR IS THAT. GOING O BE INCREASED OVER THE IN THE OUT YEARS. I MULTI YEAR PROJECTIONS HAVE SHOWN RETIREE HEALTH BENEFITS CONTINUING TO GROWING COST WITH- JUST GENERAL RISES IN HEALTH CARE COSTS AND SINCE YOU KNOW HEALTHCARE COSTS ARE RISING- ARE COSTS TO PROVIDE BENEFITS FOR HOW RETIREE HEALTH IS ALSO RISING ANOTHER THING TO NOTE ABOUT RETIREE HEALTH IS THAT THE STATE- BEGAN I'VE FOUGHT BEGAN A PLAN TO PRE FUND RETIREE HEALTH BENEFITS IN THE TWENTY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN BUDGET. THROUGH THE BARGAINING- PROCESS OUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND SO STATE COSTS- FOR PRE FUNDING OF RETIREE HEALTH HAVE ALSO INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS ALTHOUGH I THINK YOU KNOW THE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THAT MIGHT BE THAT THE STATE IS SETTING ASIDE MORE MONEY TODAY- IN ORDER TO PAY FOR THOSE COSTS IN THE FUTURE AND IDEALLY. TO PAY MUCH LESS IN THE FUTURE THAN IT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE HAD IT NOT SET ASIDE THAT MONEY TODAY SURE SO SPEAKING OF RETIREE HEALTH THAT THERE THERE THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS WE WANT TO DO IN THE STATE BUDGET. DR RAMBLE AS SUBCOMMITTEE IN MIND THERE'S LESS THERE ARE LINES FOR HOURS AND WE COULD SPEND OUR BUDGETS TWO TIMES OVER ON OUR WISH LIST AND WE JUST DON'T DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES AND SO YOU KNOW WHAT DO YOU DO YOU YOU YOU CUT SPENDING OR YOU INCREASED TAX REVENUE OR YOU HOPE THE ECONOMY GROWS AND MAYBE A COMBINATION. ONE THING THAT THAT POPS UP EVERY NOW AND THEN IS THIS ISSUE WITH- EMPLOYEE EMPLOYEE HEALTHCARE RETIREES. AND THERE IS THERE PROPOSALS THAT I'VE HEARD OF BUT WHEN I WAS A LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO AS FAR AS OUR AREN'T STATE EMPLOYEES ARE GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY SWITCHING TO MEDICARE- WHEN THEY'RE- WHEN THEY ARE DONE AGE ELIGIBLE WHEN CORRECT. THE TWO LOOK AT I CAN. SIX SIXTY. AND SO I HAVE THOUGHT A THAT A FAR AS TEAM THAT WE COULD DO IN STATE LAW TO BASICALLY- YOU KNOW HAVE MORE OF OUR HAVE OUR IN OUR INDIVIDUALS GO TO MEDICARE WE ARE WE LEAVING MONEY ON THE TABLE AND PAYING FOR HEALTH CARE WITH STATE DOLLARS WHICH WE COULD BE DRAWING DOWN FEDERAL DOLLARS AND HAVING THOSE INDIVIDUALS GOING ON MEDICARE EVEN IF WE HAVE TO BUY YOU KNOW LIKE THAT. COULD LEAD TO THAT ADVANTAGE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE THE PLAN B. TO WHATEVER TO GET THEM TO THE SAME LEVEL WERE THAT. AND THEN WE COULD USE THOSE FOR OTHER PRIORITIES IN THE STATE BUDGET. YEAH LET ME TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE CAROLINE CHU WHO CAN TALK ABOUT THIS A LITTLE BIT MORE. GEN CAROLINE. OKAY YES SO- YOU ARE YOU ARE CORRECT THAT WHEN- RETIRED. US STATE RETIREES I TURN SIXTY FIVE THAT THERE ARE. OVERHEAD BENEFIT CONVERTS ESSENTIALLY TO BE A WRAPAROUND BENEFIT FOR MEDICARE. SO THERE THE- MONEY THAT THE CITY WOULD OTHERWISE BE USING TO PAY FOR THEIR HEALTH CARE PREMIUMS- THROUGH LIKE A KAISER OR OTHER TYPE OF. HEALTH INSURERS- GOES TOWARDS. FOR THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF MEDICARE COVERAGE FOR THEIR PART A PART B. PART. C. AND D. IT'S OTHER UP. YEAH SO IS THERE AFTER EVERY BEEN A REAL PROPOSAL AS FAR AS SHIFTING ANYTHING TO. HAVING MORE INDIVIDUALS. GO TO MEDICARE AND NOT HAVING THAT STATE BENEFIT. THEY THEY DO HAVE TO SHIFT TO MEDICARE COVERAGE YES THEY HAVE TO SHIFT TO MEDICARE COVERAGE OF SIXTY FIVE WHAT THE STATE CONTINUES TO PAY FOR OUR THEIR MEDICARE PREMIUMS- THE STATE AS FAR AS MY KNOWLEDGE GOES HAS NOT HAD DELIBERATIONS ON WHETHER OR NOT TO- SHIFT SHE WHERE- RETIREES PAY FOR THOSE PREMIUMS OUT OF POCKET. AND THE BENEFIT IS THAT CURRENTLY EXIST IS WHERE THE STATE RETIREE HEALTH BENEFIT HE IS FOR THOSE PREMIUMS SO THE BULK OF THE- SO THE BULK OF THE MONEY. THAT WE WOULD PAY FOR INDIVIDUALS AND JUST OTHER PREMIUM FOR MEDICARE IS IF THE RETIRED SO I'M I'M LOOKING HERE AT MY- COLLEAGUE MY STATE WORKER FORMER STATE WORKER MR LACKEY WAS A FORMER CHP OFFICERS AT THE CHP OFFICER RETIRES AT. FIFTY OR FIFTY FIVE. BETWEEN GETS THOSE YEARS BETWEEN THAT CAN SIXTY FIVE. THAT WE'RE PAYING FOR AND THEN WHEN THEY TURN SIXTY FIVE IS THE PREMIUM. FOR MEDICARE. THAT WE PAY FOR EVERYBODY. AND THAT'S A THAT'S A BARGAIN IT'S A NEGOTIATED BENEFIT THAT'S THAT'S THAN THEIR- IN THE CONTRACT FOR WHAT'S- ELIGIBLE FOR EMPLOYEES. THAT IS THE THAT IS THE BENEFIT THAT THEY ARE IT IS NOT BARGAINS NECESSARILY THOUGH IT CAN BE BUT IT IS THE BENEFIT THAT THEY ARE RECEIVE WHEN THEY START EMPLOYMENT WITH THE STATE YES SO FOR ALL RETIREES TECH WORKERS AT SIXTY FIVE WE PAY THE- MEDICARE PREMIUM FOR THEM. IF THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE THEY THE STATE PAYS THE PREMIUMS. OKAY QUESTION YES OKAY THANK YOU FOR THAT SO I MAY I MAY HAVE SOME FOLLOW UP OFFLINE ABOUT THAT BECAUSE WE STILL CONTINUE TO GET ALL OF US UP HERE ENQUIRIES ABOUT THERE IS THE SOLUTION WE COULD DO X. Y. Z. THAT WE'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT WHEN IT COMES TO RETIREE HEALTH AND MEDICARE SO THANK YOU HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU YOU. MISTER MCCARTY- CHRISTIAN GRIFFITH WITH ASSEMBLY BUDGET THE- TED SERVICES ABOUT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND IT'S OF ROUGHLY FIVE POINT 8% OF STATE GENERAL FUND REVENUE YEAH IT IS THAT A TRADITIONAL- AMOUNT- IS THAT RELATIVELY HIGH. OR LOW. SO IT IS- IT HAS BEEN GOING DOWN IT WENT UP THIS LAST YEAR BECAUSE THE ACTUAL REVENUE NUMBER WENT DOWN SO THE NUMBER OF IT'S STILL EIGHT BILLION BY THE END OF. THE NOMINATOR WENT DOWN BECAUSE YOU HAVE LESS REVENUE BECAUSE OF THE RECESSION BUT YOU. SENSUALLY IT IS BEEN SLOWLY GOING DOWN AS WE'VE- CEASED ISSUING. BONDS AND SO THE CONTROLLER HAS AYE THE TREASURER HAS A REPORT ON DEBT AFFORDABILITY THAT THE TRICK PHOTOGRAPHER YOU'RE THE SORT OF. DENOTES THIS IN BETWEEN THERE ARE IMPROVE CREDIT RATING AND FILL THE CESSATION OF ART BOND ISSUANCES WERE SPENDING LESS THAN WE DID BEFORE. YEAH OKAY. THANK YOU ARE. QUESTIONS FOR THE MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE. THE NUMBERS ARE NOT THE- HI GUESTS PLEASE YEAH VENTURE I'M ACTUALLY PICKING UP ON MR FONG AS INCREASE REGARDING OUR OUTLOOK IT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DO YOU HAVE AN UPDATED OUTLOOK. BASED ON WHAT WE'VE SEEN COMING IN AND ACTUALS OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS. DEPARTMENT HUNTLEY'S RESENTED THEIR PART OF FINANCE SO WE AT THE L. A. UNNOTICED HAVEN'T SEEN AN INCREASE IN THE CASH RECEIPTS- YOUR TODAY. HOWEVER IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE CASH RECEIPTS DON'T ALWAYS EQUATE TO INCREASED REVENUES WHEN WE BUILD THE STATE BUDGET- ADDITIONALLY- ALSO AT THE L. AND THEN CHEN. YOU KNOW TO BALANCE THIS BUDGET WE HAD TO DO FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS AND SOLUTIONS SO TO THE EXTENT THERE IS A- UPTICK IN REVENUE IT MIGHT. JUST REDUCE SOME OF THOSE SOLUTIONS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN- TAKEN- SO WE DO NOT HAVE AN UPDATED BUT WE DO THOSE AT TWO DIFFERENT POINTS IN TIME THE NEXT ONE IS COMING UP IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- AND JANUARY TENTH SO WE'RE CURRENTLY WORKING ON ALL THOSE DETAILS CASH- DETAILS REVENUES. AND INCREASED EXPENDITURES AS A RESULT OF COVERT NINETEEN AND ALSO THE STATE FIRE SO I'M JAN TEN WE WILL BE PRODUCING A STRUCTURALLY. BALANCED STATE BUDGET. OKAY AND AS YOU AS YOU MENTIONED TO SOLVE OUR FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET PROBLEM THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS THAT. THAT WE HAD DEPLOYED. AND SAID NEARLY A FIFTH OF. THE OVERALL BUDGET SOLUTIONS. CAME FROM CAN BE CHANGES HOWEVER BASELINE ASSUMPTIONS AND SUCH AS CAL WORKS CASELOAD REDUCTIONS- AB ONE REMEMBER BEING THE SUBJECT OF A LOT A LOT OF CONVERSATION- ARE WE SEEN THOSE ACTUALS TRACK. IN LINE WITH OUR ASSUMPTIONS ARE ARE WE REALIZING THOSE GAINS. I DO NOT HAVE THAT INFORMATION AND I DON'T KNOW THAT I ANYONE. WITH ME RIGHT NOW THAT CAN GIVE THAT'S WE CAN CERTAINLY. HI CAROLYN CHU FROM LEDGE AND ALL OFFICE AND- OFFER SOME INSIGHT INTO THIS THUS FAR- THE CASELOADS IN BOTH CAL WORKS AND MEDICAL HAVE TRACKED. HELLO BUDGET ACT ESTIMATES- NOW THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT WE WON'T SEE FUTURE INCREASES IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS- AS BOTH OUR OFFICE AND I THINK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- WE WERE WITHOUT PRECEDENT IN TRYING TO ESTIMATE WHEN WE MIGHT SEE INCREASES IN CASELOAD FROM THE SIGNIFICANT LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT THAT WE- US SOCCER IN THE SPRING. OKAY GREAT THANK YOU. AND THEN JUST ONE LAST QUESTION A PICKING UP AND IT MIGHT BE THAT WE NEED TO SAY THIS FOR FOLLOW UP AS WELL BUT I'M PICKING UP ON AT THAT THE QUESTIONS AROUND HIGH SPEED RAIL- SO HOW HOW MUCH ARE WE GOING TO BE SPENDING ON HIGH HIGH SPEED RAIL THIS BUDGET YEAR. I'M SORRY I DON'T I DON'T KNOW THAT OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD. OKAY MAYBE MAYBE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HOUSES. I DO NOT HAVE THAT INFORMATION AS WELL. ONE MOMENT I DO THINK WE HAVE SOMEONE WHO CAN HELP YOU A COLLEAGUE OF MINE. ONE OF OUR FINANCE- WE ARE. ALL THE FUNDS ARE BEING SPENT TO HIGH SPEED RAIL PEOPLE HAVE BEEN- APPROPRIATED IN PAST YEARS- SO- IN TERMS OF THE INDIVIDUAL EXPENDITURES THIS YEAR ARE WE CAN GET BACK TO YOU WITH THAT- BUT- YEAH THERE'S NOTHING BEEN NO NO A LARGE CORPORATIONS FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL THE CURRENT BUDGET. KAY ALL RIGHT YEAH IT WOULD BE GREAT IF YOU COULD PUT THAT ON A FOLLOW UP LIST I WOULD BE INTERESTED TO SEE THAT. JUST TO CLARIFY I THINK. THIS YEAR IN PARTICULAR THERE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS SPENDING FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL BECAUSE IT'S A- IT'S A- CONTINUED APPROPRIATION OUT OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND AND OBVIOUSLY THIS YEAR'S GREENHOUSE DR GRANT GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FROM WAS BECAUSE MUCH LOWER THAN PAST YEARS. SO THIS YEAR WE ANTICIPATED SIX SIGNIFICANTLY LESS- FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL IN OTHER YEARS. I'M DISCONNECTED% PUBLIC FINANCE CAN YOU CAN YOU GIVE ME THE ROUGH. CUMULATIVE NUMBER OF DODD REVENUES ARE ABOVE PROJECTIONS SINCE JULY ONE. TO DATE SHE RICHEST ROUGHLY HOW WE ARE WE TALKING LIKE A FEW MILLION DOLLARS WE'RE TALKING I BILLION DOLLARS WHAT WE TALK ABOUT. AND SO ROUGHLY ON CASH RECEIPTS- THE TODAY I HAVE THAT WAS RELEASED ON UR FINANCE NOW MY BELIEVE IS FOUR POINT EIGHT. BILLION DOLLARS ABOVE WHERE WE HAD PROJECTED FOR THE- FIRST TWO MONTHS. THANK YOU AND IT'S GOING BACK TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT CHART ON PAGE TWO FOR ALL THE MEMBERS I WOULD ENCOURAGE THEM TO LOOK AT ON THE INTERNET JUST BECAUSE IT'S SO MUCH BETTER IN COLOR IT'S EASIER TO READ- AND ESPECIALLY SINCE IT'S GETTING HARDER FOR ME TO READ THINGS IT'S THIS IS GREAT. BUT BUT JUST LOOKING AT THE CHART IT SEEMS MANY OF THESE ITEMS. ARE ITEMS THAT WE CAN IN SOME WAYS DON'T HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL OVER OBVIOUSLY MET MEDICARE WAS A VERY BIG. BUBBLE AND HEALTH CARE COSTS- WHILE WE'RE TRYING TO MANAGE THEM. ARE ALSO WHAT HEALTHCARE COSTS ARE HIGH- DDS AND I HSS ARE REFLECTION OF THE GROWING. POPULATIONS THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THOSE IN THOSE SOME COMMUTING SAYS THAT IT'S NOT IT'S A FAIR ACCURATE STATEMENT REGARDING THOSE THREE HOURS. SCUMBAG TO MISS HOLLINGSHEAD YEAH- SO YES FOR IHS US AND DDS WE'VE SEEN INCREASES PRIMARILY DRIVEN THROUGH CASELOAD FOR EXAMPLE FOR DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES THIS IS BECAUSE THERE BEEN INCREASES AND THEIR RATES OF INDIVIDUALS DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM I AM ALSO DDS COSTS HAVE INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS BECAUSE OF A SHIFT AWAY FROM INSTITUTIONALIZATION AND THROUGH AND TO INDIVIDUAL IT- TAILOR TREATMENT- AND CARE AND SO- THAT'S A BIG REASON FOR D. S. AND THEN I JUST US AGAIN. ARE GROWING SENIOR POPULATION SO CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE STATE. DR RIBBONS AS WELL BECAUSE HE HEARS IT EVERY WEEK BUT- YOU KNOW WE COULD WE COULD CUT HI HSS- BUT THEN THAT POPULATION WE HAVE TO GO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SERVE THE POPULATION EITHER IN NURSING HOMES OR OTHER CHRONIC CARE FACILITIES THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EXPENSIVE THAN IN HOME. SUPPORT SERVICES. THAT ACTOR YEAH BUT I ALSO ADD THE BECAUSE I JUST IS A JOINT FEDERAL STATE PROGRAM THE STATE ACTUALLY HAS QUITE A LOT OF- LIMITATIONS ON HOW THEY CAN CUT IHS US IN VARIOUS WAYS. THANK YOU. AND THEN- THE CALTRANS NUMBER. LOOKS ON- LARGER. BUT A BIZARRE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE REVENUE FROM THE GAS TAX AND IT'S THE INCREASING CAPITAL COSTS WERE FINALLY FIXING ROADS THAT WE HAVE A FIX FOR DECADES. THAT'S RIGHT IF YOU LOOK AT THE GRAPH ON PAGE. SO FOR ME TO GET IT THE ONE WITH OUR LOCAL. PAGE THANK YOU SEVEN SEVEN SIX YEAH THE ONE THAT SAYS MOST A CASA FOR LOCAL ASSISTANCE AND YOU SEE TRANSPORTATION AT THE BOTTOM THERE THOSE THAT INCREASE AND IN CAPITAL OUTLAY THAT YOU SEE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS WHICH IS DRIVING THE INCREASE IN THE ANNUAL AVERAGE GROWTH FOR OUR TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS. IS ON SB ONE REVENUES THAT ARE BEING USED FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS BRIAN ALSO MONEY FOR LOCALS WHICH ALSO GOES TO CAPITOL. RIGHT OF COURSE THAT THE BLUE RIDGE TO K. TO IT JUST IT JUST A LEVEL. INTENDED LOOKING AT I DON'T KNOW DOCTOR AND THE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER CARACAL FIRE RIGHT OBVIOUSLY TO NUMB THAT IS. ON TO CEMEX OUT OF OUR CONTROL TO THAT'S EXPENDITURES AS BEING DRIVEN FROM ALL THE WILDFIRES THAT'S GOING ON. YEAH AND THEN THERE'S ALSO- OTHER AB. YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE FIRE RECENTLY. OR IS UNDERGOING AN INITIATIVE TO REPLACE ITS HELICOPTER FLEET SO THERE'S I'M ALSO COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH. SO I GUESS IN THE AREAS WHERE WE COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND HAVE SOME LEVEL OF SIGNIFICANCE I GUESS WE COULD DECIDE TO- CUT CSU OR TO SPEND LESS ON CSU AS WELL AS- A CHILD CARE AND PRESCHOOL THAT THAT'S WHERE IT SEEMS LIKE WE HAVE. SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DISCRETION THAT AREN'T JUST SHE- FEDERAL PROGRAMS OR SORT OF ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS. YEAH PROGRAMS ARE THE LEGISLATURE HAS MORE FLEXIBILITY TO MAKE REDUCTIONS ARE UNIVERSITIES AS YOU NOTED CSU UC- EMPLOYEE% COMPENSATION WHICH IS REALLY ARE YOU KNOW IN IN. QUITE ALL OF THESE- CIRCLES BUT YOU KNOW SIR DISTRIBUTED ACROSS THE BUDGET AND THEN IN THE COURT SYSTEM. KIND IN IN THAT OBVIOUSLY LOT LONG TERM I KNOW THAT OUR OUR COMMITTEE HAS BEEN LOOKING AT I'M TRYING TO FIND LONG TERM SAVINGS WITHIN CDC ARE OBVIOUSLY THEY'VE BEEN GROWING AT A LOWER RATE THAN AVERAGE BUT IT'S STILL A FAIRLY LARGE BUBBLE AND WE HOPE WITH THE GOVERNOR'S ANNOUNCEMENT TO CLOSE ONE PERSON THAT THAT SENSE- CRITICS AWAY SURE WHERE WE'RE GOING TO START TO REALIZE SOME SOME COST SAVINGS FROM. THAT PRISON AS WELL AS THE PRISON FROM NEXT YEAR HI IF ANYTHING ELSE THAT WERE IN TERMS OF AREAS WHERE WE HAVE. SOME LEVEL OF FLEXIBLE DELIVERY. WELL YOU KNOW I MEAN I DON'T DON'T WANT TO OVERSTATE THE LEVEL OF INFLEXIBILITY THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS CERTAINLY THERE ARE OPTIONS- FOR EXAMPLE IN THE PROP NINETY EIGHT AREA WHICH IS THE LARGEST SINGLE GENERAL FUND FUNDED PROGRAM- BUT THE LEGISLATURE CANNOT CHANGE THE ALLOCATION TO SCHOOLSAND COMMUNITY COLLEGES- WITH A TWO THIRDS VOTE SO THE FORMULA IS CONSTITUTIONALLY DRIVING BUT THE LEGISLATURE CAN SHE CAN CHANGE THE ALLOCATION OF TE TWO THIRDS VOTE SO. I DON'T I DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS ITS HANDS TIED IN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE AREAS EXCEPT FOR THOSE FEW HANDFUL BUT OFTEN OBVIOUSLY THOSE ARE GOING TO INVOLVED ACCUSED NUMBER OF TRADE OFFS AND ALSO- IN SOME CASES LIKE WITH PROP NINETY EIGHT WOULD INVOLVE MORE THAN A MAJORITY VOTE. THANK YOU NOT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT- CLARIFICATION BY THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FLAT HEAD PUSHING YOU SETTING THE- SINCE THE SAYS SAYS SAYS ADDING THE WAY THE FIELD WOULD LOOK IN ORDER TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES SO. AGREED COOL GREAT AGAIN THANK. YEAH I'LL BEGIN JUST THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE YOU KNOW YOUR YOUR GREAT WORK THIS IS YOU KNOW ONE OF THEM- BEST PRESENTATIONS I'VE SEEN ON THE STATE BUDGET I THINK THE BUDGET I OFTENTIMES IS. MYSTIFYING NOT ONLY LEGISLATORS BUT ALSO OUR BECAUSE I THINK THIS HELPS CREATE A NICE GRAPH THAT'S EASILY UNDERSTANDABLE- EASILY DIGESTIBLE BUT ALSO AS POLICY MAKE POLICY MAKERS HELP US FOCUS ON ON CERTAIN ITEMS BECAUSE I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU KNOW WE OBVIOUSLY FOCUS ON THE RIGHT TYPES OF ITEMS ARE AFTER DOING THE BUDGET BECAUSE- ON SOME OF THESE TRADE OFFS ARE FAIRLY SMALL. THIS WEEK WE FOCUSING ON ITEMS THAT ARE ARE SMALL AND REALLY WOULDN'T. MAKE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO BALANCE BUDGET AT THE SAME TIME I HAVE A LARGE LOT NUMBER OF LARGER ITEMS WHICH WE I THINK IN OUR MINDS KNOW EXISTS BUT IT'S ACTUALLY VERY HELPFUL TO HAVE A FRAME THIS WAY- SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS- DISCRETE PRESENTATION. OF MR FONG. I JUST JUST ENSURE THAT THE THAT THE CHAIR HAS SAID AND FOR SAID TO. THE LEGISLATIVE LEDGES AS APPROPRIATED FIVE POINT FIVE BILLION.

HELLO SEQUELS PARDON THE FINANCE- YOU KNOW BIG THE SP ONE INCLUDED THE MECHANISM BY ADDING A- A ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE FEE OF IT GOES INTO EFFECT THIS YEAR AND- WELL THAT CURRENTLY AFFECTS A SMALL NUMBER OF CARS- THE THOUGHT PROCESS ON THAT IS TO HAVE A MECHANISM AND AS THE FLEET- OVERTIME IS REPLACED- INEVITABLY WITH ELECTRIC CARS. THAT THAT- THAT FEE WILL THEN START TO A REPLACE- THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE THAT WE USE FOR GASOLINE AND CERTAINLY AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND AS THE TRENDS- START TO PUT SORT OF PLAY OUT WE'RE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS AND LOOKING TO SEE YOU KNOW- WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN THE FUTURE AS MOVE FORWARD THAT.
