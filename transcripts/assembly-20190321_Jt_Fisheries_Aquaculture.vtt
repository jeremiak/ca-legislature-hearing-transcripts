WERE CONTENDING WITH --

00:12:09.895 --> 00:12:10.863
ONE OF WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:12.098
CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:12:12.164 --> 00:12:13.532
I AM AS I UNDERSTAND IT CLIMATE

00:12:13.599 --> 00:12:14.967
CHANGE IS HAVING A MAJOR IMPACT

00:12:15.034 --> 00:12:16.702
ON THE OCEANS --

00:12:16.769 --> 00:12:17.303
WHICH IS HAVING IMPACT ON THE

00:12:17.369 --> 00:12:21.340
FISHERIES IN ACIDIFICATION.

00:12:21.407 --> 00:12:23.342
IS WREAKING HAVOC HI IF YOU'RE

00:12:23.409 --> 00:12:26.212
SHELLFISH FARMER IT MEANS IT

00:12:26.278 --> 00:12:27.980
IMPACTS ON YOUR YIELDS --

00:12:28.047 --> 00:12:30.216
IF YOUR CRAB FISHERMEN IT MEANS

00:12:30.282 --> 00:12:32.485
YOU'RE SEES AND MAY HAVE BEEN

00:12:32.551 --> 00:12:34.153
CLOSED -- BY

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:35.888
IT WAS CLOSED A COUPLE YEARS AGO

00:12:35.955 --> 00:12:38.557
AS A RESULT OF DEMONIC ACID

00:12:38.624 --> 00:12:39.492
WHICH HAS A CONNECTION.

00:12:39.558 --> 00:12:41.260
TO OUR CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:12:41.327 --> 00:12:42.962
HI AND THEN IMPACTING MIGRATION

00:12:43.028 --> 00:12:47.032
PATTERNS OF MARINE MAMMALS I AND

00:12:47.099 --> 00:12:48.501
CHALLENGING THAT KIND OF THE

00:12:48.567 --> 00:12:49.668
USUAL --

00:12:49.735 --> 00:12:51.337
HARVEST OF OF CRAP ANOTHER

00:12:51.403 --> 00:12:52.404
FISHERIES.

00:12:52.471 --> 00:12:54.039
BUT THEN TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER --

00:12:54.106 --> 00:12:55.341
DOLLIES POINT --

00:12:55.407 --> 00:12:56.876
LET'S NOT ONLY FORGET OUR LET'S

00:12:56.942 --> 00:12:58.010
NOT FORGET I SHOULD SAY THAT

00:12:58.077 --> 00:12:58.811
WE'RE WE'RE NOT ONLY TALKING

00:12:58.878 --> 00:12:59.879
ABOUT THE OCEANS BUT WE'RE

00:12:59.945 --> 00:13:02.281
TALKING ABOUT OUR WATERWAYS AND

00:13:02.348 --> 00:13:03.282
OUR HEADWATERS.

00:13:03.349 --> 00:13:04.683
AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT --

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:06.752
FISHERIES IN THE FUTURE I WANT

00:13:06.819 --> 00:13:08.454
TO INTEGRATE THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:13:08.521 --> 00:13:10.055
WATER RESOURCES --

00:13:10.122 --> 00:13:11.323
THE STATE WATER RESOURCES

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:12.525
CONTROL BOARD.

00:13:12.591 --> 00:13:13.225
CAL FIRE WHICH YOU WOULDN'T

00:13:13.292 --> 00:13:16.195
NORMALLY N. C. IMPACTING

00:13:16.262 --> 00:13:18.030
FISHERIES BUT YOU CAN BAT --

00:13:18.097 --> 00:13:19.798
THAT OUR FORESTS ARE IN CRISIS

00:13:19.865 --> 00:13:21.367
AND THEY HAVE A REAL IMPACT ON

00:13:21.433 --> 00:13:22.902
OUR WATERSHEDS NOT ONLY THE

00:13:22.968 --> 00:13:25.070
SUPPLY OF WATER TO COMMUNITIES.

00:13:25.137 --> 00:13:27.473
BUT NOT THE SUPPLY WATER THAT

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.542
PROVIDES CRITICAL HABITAT FOR

00:13:29.608 --> 00:13:30.643
THE FISHERIES.

00:13:30.709 --> 00:13:32.745
SO I'M REALLY X. EXCITED AND

00:13:32.811 --> 00:13:33.979

00:13:35.548 --> 00:13:37.016
OUR RESOURCE MANAGEMENT.

00:13:37.082 --> 00:13:38.417
AND WE DON'T TREAT OCEANS AND

00:13:38.484 --> 00:13:39.785
FRESH WATER AND FORESTS

00:13:39.852 --> 00:13:41.520
SEPARATELY IN SEPARATE SILOS BUT

00:13:41.587 --> 00:13:42.855
WE INTEGRATE --

00:13:42.922 --> 00:13:45.524
AND IT'S IT'S COMPLICATED BUT

00:13:45.591 --> 00:13:46.592
IT'S ESSENTIAL --

00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:47.927
MOVING FORWARD.

00:13:47.993 --> 00:13:49.895

00:18:03.048 --> 00:18:04.349
FROM PAPER [inaudible]

00:18:04.416 --> 00:18:06.151
THE DIGITAL.

00:18:06.218 --> 00:18:07.519
BECAUSE WE WERE ABLE TO TAKE NEW

00:18:07.586 --> 00:18:08.787
CAPACITY INPUTTED TO FISHER'S

00:18:08.854 --> 00:18:10.355
WORK.

00:18:10.422 --> 00:18:12.825
WE HIRED TWO NEW POSITIONS FOR

00:18:12.891 --> 00:18:14.059
SUSTAINABLE AND INNOVATIVE

00:18:14.126 --> 00:18:16.695
FISHERY MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.

00:18:16.762 --> 00:18:18.197
ONE OF WHICH IS FOCUSED ENTIRELY

00:18:18.263 --> 00:18:20.299
ON THINKING THROUGH THE CLIMATE

00:18:20.365 --> 00:18:22.000
CHANGE IMPACTS THE FISHERIES.

00:18:22.067 --> 00:18:23.435
AND DEALING WITH EXPERIMENTAL

00:18:23.502 --> 00:18:25.070
PILOT PROJECTS --

00:18:25.137 --> 00:18:26.805
OF THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON OUT

00:18:26.872 --> 00:18:28.807
IN OUR OCEANS.

00:18:28.874 --> 00:18:30.742
WE TOOK TO THOSE POSITIONS AND

00:18:30.809 --> 00:18:33.612
WE HARD NEWS STAFF DEDICATED TO

00:18:33.679 --> 00:18:35.180
WHALE SAVE FISHERIES.

00:18:35.247 --> 00:18:36.482
THEN USING THAT STAFF IN NEW

00:18:36.548 --> 00:18:38.283
CAPACITY WE'VE IMPLEMENTED NEW

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:39.718
REGULATIONS TO RESTRICT THE

00:18:39.785 --> 00:18:41.587
AMOUNT OF SURFACE GEAR WHICH CAN

00:18:41.653 --> 00:18:44.223
BE USED IN DUNGEONS CRAB TRAPS.

00:18:44.289 --> 00:18:46.291
WE'VE DEVELOPED OUR ABANDONED

00:18:46.358 --> 00:18:48.894
AND LOST COMMERCIAL CROWD CHAT

00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:49.528
PROGRAM WHICH I'LL TALK ABOUT IN

00:18:49.595 --> 00:18:50.229
A MINUTE.

00:18:50.295 --> 00:18:51.997
AND WE'VE KIND OF UNDER WRITTEN

00:18:52.064 --> 00:18:54.600
THE CONVENING OF THE DODGES CRAB.

00:18:54.666 --> 00:18:56.335
GEAR WORKING GROUP AND THE TASK

00:18:56.401 --> 00:18:58.570

ALERT MMHM MMHM MMHM.

00:18:59.938 --> 00:19:03.175
I WAS TALKING WITH THE OCEAN AND

00:19:03.242 --> 00:19:04.610
OUR DEPARTMENT STAFF WE'RE GONNA

00:19:04.676 --> 00:19:06.345
BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NO

00:19:06.411 --> 00:19:08.347
SO THERE'S NO BREAK.

00:19:08.413 --> 00:19:10.015
THERE'S A SEAMLESS --

00:19:10.082 --> 00:19:11.650
PROGRESSION OF THE MEETING OF

00:19:11.717 --> 00:19:13.318

CARE OF THE FUNDING TO MAKE SURE

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:15.954
THAT HAPPENS.

00:19:16.021 --> 00:19:17.689
SO AS WE COME OUT OF SUSTAINABLE

00:19:17.756 --> 00:19:19.191
FUNDING YOU MAY REMEMBER WE WERE

00:19:19.258 --> 00:19:21.260

USING AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE

00:20:34.266 --> 00:20:36.702
SYSTEM -- I

00:20:36.768 --> 00:20:38.270
HAVE MENTIONED A MOMENT AGO OUR

00:20:38.337 --> 00:20:39.304

00:20:44.543 --> 00:20:48.113
NEWS.

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:50.115
GROUNDFISH STOCKS IN CALIFORNIA

00:20:50.182 --> 00:20:51.717
ARE REBUILDING.

00:20:51.783 --> 00:20:53.552
AND WE ONLY HAVE TWO GROUNDFISH

00:20:53.619 --> 00:20:54.553
STOCKS.

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:57.022
OFF OF OUR COAST REMAINING THAT

00:20:57.089 --> 00:20:59.124
ARE CONSIDERED OVERFISHED.

00:20:59.191 --> 00:21:00.892
THIS IS TRANSLATING INTO MORE

00:21:00.959 --> 00:21:01.960
OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMMERCIAL AND

00:21:02.027 --> 00:21:03.195
RECREATIONAL ANGLERS AND IT'S A

00:21:03.261 --> 00:21:04.863
BIG DEAL.

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:06.431
IF YOU GO BACK FIVE TEN YEARS

00:21:06.498 --> 00:21:08.166
MOST OF THESE STOCKS WERE DEEMED

00:21:08.233 --> 00:21:09.501
OVERFISHED.

00:21:09.568 --> 00:21:11.336
AND WE'VE REBUILT ALL OF THEM

00:21:11.403 --> 00:21:12.571
EXCEPT.

00:21:12.638 --> 00:21:13.672
FOR TWO THAT MEANS THE FOLKS

00:21:13.739 --> 00:21:15.407
BEHIND ME IN THIS ROOM HAVE MORE

00:21:15.474 --> 00:21:16.675
RECREATIONAL AND COMMERCIAL

00:21:16.742 --> 00:21:18.043
FISHING OPPORTUNITY.

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:20.712
LET'S TURN TO THE KLAMATH.

00:21:20.779 --> 00:21:21.613
I THINK THIS IS GOOD NEWS AS

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.348
WELL.

00:21:23.415 --> 00:21:24.449
MOST RECENTLY WE HAD A

00:21:24.516 --> 00:21:26.284
DISRUPTION IN THE FORCE AROUND

00:21:26.351 --> 00:21:27.919
THE PROSPECT OF LISTING A

00:21:27.986 --> 00:21:30.422
CERTAIN RUN OF SALMON THAT EXIST

00:21:30.489 --> 00:21:31.690
IN THE KLAMATH RIVER.

00:21:31.757 --> 00:21:33.025
UNDER THE CALIFORNIA ENDANGERED

00:21:33.091 --> 00:21:34.426
SPECIES ACT.

00:21:34.493 --> 00:21:35.627
OUR FISH AND GAME COMMISSION

00:21:35.694 --> 00:21:37.029
TOOK THIS UP AT HIS LAST PUBLIC

00:21:37.095 --> 00:21:38.330
MEETING.

00:21:38.397 --> 00:21:41.099
AND I OFFERED TO THE COMMISSION

00:21:41.166 --> 00:21:42.701
AND THE STAKE HOLDERS INVOLVED.

00:21:42.768 --> 00:21:44.603
TO FOCUS THE CONVERSATION AROUND

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:46.338
WHETHER THERE WAS A WAY TO HAVE

00:21:46.405 --> 00:21:51.476
THE LISTING PROCESS CONTINUE.-AT THE SAME TIME WE PROVIDE SOME

00:21:51.543 --> 00:21:53.545
FISHING OPPORTUNITY.

00:21:53.612 --> 00:21:55.047
THIS IS ALLOWABLE UNDER LAW

00:21:55.113 --> 00:21:57.549
WE'VE LOOKED INTO IT WE'VE HELD

00:21:57.616 --> 00:21:58.183
THREE MEETINGS WITH NORTH COAST

00:21:58.250 --> 00:21:59.518
COUNTY.

00:21:59.584 --> 00:22:01.420
IN NORTH COAST FISHING INTERESTS

00:22:01.486 --> 00:22:03.388
TO CONSIDER OPTIONS FOR RE

00:22:03.455 --> 00:22:05.123
OPENING A FISHERY FOR THE SPRING

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:06.391
CHINOOK SALMON ON THE KLAMATH

00:22:06.458 --> 00:22:08.560
RIVER WHILE WE'RE CONTINUING OUR

00:22:08.627 --> 00:22:10.028
STATUS REVIEW.

00:22:10.095 --> 00:22:13.498
SUBJECT TO THE THE ESA PETITION --

00:22:13.565 --> 00:22:14.900
LISTING PROCESS.

00:22:14.966 --> 00:22:16.034
SO WE'VE ALREADY HAD MEETINGS IN

00:22:16.101 --> 00:22:18.403
CRESCENT CITY.

00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:19.504
AND I BELIEVE THERE'S A MEETING

00:22:19.571 --> 00:22:20.772
IN READING SCHEDULE FOR NEXT

00:22:20.839 --> 00:22:23.308
WEEK ON THAT TOPIC.

00:22:23.375 --> 00:22:25.243
AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THE OCEAN

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:26.344
SALMON FISHING SEASON

00:22:26.411 --> 00:22:28.046
ALTERNATIVES WERE DEVELOPED

00:22:28.113 --> 00:22:30.082
ALREADY IN RECOGNITION OF THE

00:22:30.148 --> 00:22:31.850
NEED TO MINIMIZE THE RISK.

00:22:31.917 --> 00:22:33.118
OF SPRING RUN IN THE KLAMATH

00:22:33.185 --> 00:22:34.519
BECAUSE THEY MAY EVENTUALLY BE

00:22:34.586 --> 00:22:36.254
LISTED.

00:22:36.321 --> 00:22:37.522
AND UNDER LAW IN THE STATE SIDE

00:22:37.589 --> 00:22:39.257
WHILE WE'RE CONSIDERING LISTING

00:22:39.324 --> 00:22:41.126
FOR THE YEAR PERIOD.

00:22:41.193 --> 00:22:42.794
THEY GET LEGAL PROTECTION SO

00:22:42.861 --> 00:22:43.895
WE'VE ALREADY GONE OVER TO THE

00:22:43.962 --> 00:22:45.697
FEDERAL FRONT AND TALKED ABOUT

00:22:45.764 --> 00:22:47.265
THE DIFFERENT FEDERAL.

00:22:47.332 --> 00:22:48.967
OPTIONS IN THE OCEAN BEING

00:22:49.034 --> 00:22:51.203
SUFFICIENTLY PROTECTIVE OF THE

00:22:51.269 --> 00:22:52.804
SPRING RUN AS THEY'RE OUT IN THE

00:22:52.871 --> 00:22:54.272
OCEAN.

00:22:54.339 --> 00:22:56.007
IF YOU TAKE A BROADER LOOK AT

00:22:56.074 --> 00:22:58.076
THE OCEAN OVERALL I ALSO THINK

00:22:58.143 --> 00:22:59.878
THIS IS GOOD NEWS.

00:22:59.945 --> 00:23:01.246
THE SPORT AND COMMERCIAL OCEAN

00:23:01.313 --> 00:23:03.215
SALMON FISHERIES ARE ANTICIPATED

00:23:03.281 --> 00:23:06.351
TO BE BETTER THAN THEY WERE IN.

00:23:06.418 --> 00:23:06.985
TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND THAT'S

00:23:07.052 --> 00:23:08.286
MOSTLY DO A SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT

00:23:08.353 --> 00:23:09.888
IN THE OCEAN ABUNDANCE

00:23:09.955 --> 00:23:11.690
CONDITIONS AND FORECAST.

00:23:11.757 --> 00:23:13.492
SO THOSE SEASON DATES WILL BE

00:23:13.558 --> 00:23:15.127
FINALIZED UNTIL APRIL.

00:23:15.193 --> 00:23:16.294
BUT IF I LOOK AT ALL THE

00:23:16.361 --> 00:23:17.562
ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE OUT FOR

00:23:17.629 --> 00:23:18.897
PUBLIC REVIEW AT THE FEDERAL

00:23:18.964 --> 00:23:20.866
COUNCIL LEVEL ALL OF THOSE

00:23:20.932 --> 00:23:22.234
ALTERNATIVES.

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:23.869
ALLOW FOR SIGNIFICANT FISHING

00:23:23.935 --> 00:23:25.537
TIME IN THE OCEAN OFF THE

00:23:25.604 --> 00:23:28.006
CALIFORNIA COAST WHICH IS GOOD

00:23:28.073 --> 00:23:29.241
NEWS COMPARED TO WHERE WE'VE

00:23:29.307 --> 00:23:29.441
BEEN.

00:23:29.508 --> 00:23:30.776
YEARS BEFORE.

00:23:30.842 --> 00:23:32.711
IF YOU TURN AND LOOK FRESH WATER

00:23:32.778 --> 00:23:34.546
INLAND I THINK THAT'S MORE GOOD

00:23:34.613 --> 00:23:35.847
NEWS AS WELL.

00:23:35.914 --> 00:23:37.816
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE RECREATIONAL

00:23:37.883 --> 00:23:40.152
FISHING ON FALL RUN CHINOOK

00:23:40.218 --> 00:23:42.087
SALMON IS ALSO POSITIVE. FOR

00:23:42.154 --> 00:23:43.655
BOTH THE KLAMATH TRIGGER TRINITY

00:23:43.722 --> 00:23:45.957
RIVERS AND THE SACRAMENTO RIVER

00:23:46.024 --> 00:23:48.260
WE ANTICIPATE A GOOD SEASON --

00:23:48.326 --> 00:23:50.595
WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE A REDUCE

00:23:50.662 --> 00:23:52.597
SEASON THE SACRAMENTO AS WAS THE

00:23:52.664 --> 00:23:54.966
CASE LAST YEAR --

00:23:55.033 --> 00:23:56.768
AND THE COMMISSION --

00:23:56.835 --> 00:23:58.303
IS ALSO GOING TO BE CONSIDERING

00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:00.071
EXTENDING SEASONS IN BOTH THE

00:24:00.138 --> 00:24:01.106
FEATHER AND THEM CALLING ME

00:24:01.173 --> 00:24:02.674
RIVERS.

00:24:02.741 --> 00:24:04.509
SO IF YOU LOOK TO THE OCEAN AND

00:24:04.576 --> 00:24:06.378
YOU LOOK IN RIVER WE'RE SEEING

00:24:06.444 --> 00:24:08.880
GOOD NEWS COMPARED TO LAST YEAR

00:24:08.947 --> 00:24:10.882
AND A COUPLE YEARS BEFORE THAT.

00:24:10.949 --> 00:24:13.251
LET ME TURN TO DENTURES GRAB.

00:24:13.318 --> 00:24:15.020
SO WE'RE STILL COLLECTING ALL

00:24:15.086 --> 00:24:16.755
THE LANDING INFORMATION.

00:24:16.822 --> 00:24:18.023
BUT BASED ON THE PRELIMINARY

00:24:18.089 --> 00:24:20.058
LANDINGS AND THE OBSERVATIONS

00:24:20.125 --> 00:24:22.460
WE'RE AWARE OF THE TWO THOUSAND

00:24:22.527 --> 00:24:23.595
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SEASON.

00:24:23.662 --> 00:24:25.530
IS ANTICIPATED TO YIELD LESS

00:24:25.597 --> 00:24:27.165
THAN WAS LANDED DURING THE

00:24:27.232 --> 00:24:28.733
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN SEASON.

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.368
SO JUST FOR REFERENCE POINT THE

00:24:30.435 --> 00:24:33.371
TOTAL SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN REVENUE

00:24:33.438 --> 00:24:35.373
WAS ABOUT SIXTY NINE IT'S NOT

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.943
ABOUT IT WAS PRECISELY. SIXTY

00:24:38.009 --> 00:24:39.211
NINE POINT SEVEN MILLION AND I

00:24:39.277 --> 00:24:40.712
THINK IT'LL BE A LITTLE OFF OF

00:24:40.779 --> 00:24:42.614
THAT ONCE WE'VE GONE THROUGH ALL

00:24:42.681 --> 00:24:46.418
OF THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SEASON --

00:24:46.484 --> 00:24:48.587
INFORMATION [inaudible]

00:24:48.653 --> 00:24:49.988
DEMO CASSIDY.

00:24:50.055 --> 00:24:52.257
IS A BAD NEWS STORY BUT IN SOME

00:24:52.324 --> 00:24:54.359
SENSE THIS YEAR IT WAS GOOD NEWS

00:24:54.426 --> 00:24:55.861
COMPARED TO WHERE WE'VE BEEN

00:24:55.927 --> 00:24:57.062
MOST RECENTLY.

00:24:57.128 --> 00:24:59.231
IT DID CONTINUE TO CAUSE FISHERY

00:24:59.297 --> 00:25:00.198
DELAYS IN SOME PARTS OF THE

00:25:00.265 --> 00:25:02.300
STATE BUT IT JUST WAS NOT AS

00:25:02.367 --> 00:25:05.437
NEARLY SEVERE OR AS WIDESPREAD

00:25:05.503 --> 00:25:06.905
AS PRIOR SEASONS.

00:25:06.972 --> 00:25:08.607
SOME OF OUR NORTHERN AREAS WERE

00:25:08.673 --> 00:25:10.008
DELAYED UP TO THREE WEEKS WHILE

00:25:10.075 --> 00:25:11.776
OTHER AREAS EXPERIENCED NO

00:25:11.843 --> 00:25:12.944
DELAYS AT ALL.

00:25:13.011 --> 00:25:14.346
AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE FOUND

00:25:14.412 --> 00:25:15.881
IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS IS A

00:25:15.947 --> 00:25:18.450
LITTLE IMPROVED ABILITY TO FINE

00:25:18.516 --> 00:25:19.684
TUNE.

00:25:19.751 --> 00:25:21.186
HOW WE'RE THINKING ABOUT WHICH

00:25:21.253 --> 00:25:23.054
PARTS OF THE STATE MAY BE

00:25:23.121 --> 00:25:25.056
SUBJECT TO A CLOSURE WITH AN

00:25:25.123 --> 00:25:26.658
EMPHASIS ON TRYING TO KEEP?

00:25:26.725 --> 00:25:29.961
OTHER PARTS OPEN RATHER THAN.

00:25:30.028 --> 00:25:31.429
A BROADER CLOSURE APPROACH

00:25:31.496 --> 00:25:32.964
LOOKING AT IT MORE SURGICALLY

00:25:33.031 --> 00:25:34.566
BASED ON OUR DIALOGUE WITH THE

00:25:34.633 --> 00:25:36.167
PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES.

00:25:36.234 --> 00:25:37.535
AND THE OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL

00:25:37.602 --> 00:25:38.904
HEALTH HAZARD ASSESSMENT.

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:42.007
DISASTER FUNDING.

00:25:42.073 --> 00:25:44.743
WE ARE WAITING FOR THE CRAB

00:25:44.809 --> 00:25:46.211
DISASTER FUNDING.

00:25:46.278 --> 00:25:48.680
AND I MADE A PROMISE TO NO ONE

00:25:48.747 --> 00:25:50.515
OPPENHEIM YESTERDAY THAT I WOULD

00:25:50.582 --> 00:25:52.317
GO CHECK INTO THIS.

00:25:52.384 --> 00:25:55.453
AND WE CAN REPORT.

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:57.188
THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED SOME VERY

00:25:57.255 --> 00:25:58.924
RECENT LAST MAYBE TWO DAYS

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:00.492
QUESTIONS FROM THE OFFICE OF

00:26:00.558 --> 00:26:01.626

AND BE ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL WE

00:26:03.395 --> 00:26:04.829
THINK THEIR FINAL CLARIFYING

00:26:04.896 --> 00:26:05.997
QUESTIONS.

00:26:06.064 --> 00:26:07.532
WE SPOKE WITH OUR COUNTERPARTS

00:26:07.599 --> 00:26:09.968
IN THE FEDERAL SYSTEM AND WE

00:26:10.035 --> 00:26:11.336
THINK WE CAN.

00:26:11.403 --> 00:26:12.737
SEE THESE FUNDS COMING TO US BY

00:26:12.804 --> 00:26:14.839
MAY.

00:26:14.906 --> 00:26:15.440
ONE BUT I THINK THEY SHOULD BE

HERE TOMORROW.

00:26:16.641 --> 00:26:18.944
SO I WILL MAKE MY COMMITMENT IS

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:19.778
DIRECTOR AND I THINK THE

00:26:19.844 --> 00:26:21.646
SECRETARY WILL CONCUR WILL DO

00:26:21.713 --> 00:26:23.782

00:26:33.692 --> 00:26:36.361
STUFFED UP.

00:26:36.428 --> 00:26:36.928
WE ARE CURRENTLY IN FEDERAL

00:26:36.995 --> 00:26:38.763
COURT --

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:41.333
AROUND LITIGATION OVER THE

00:26:41.399 --> 00:26:43.034
INTERPLAY BETWEEN OUR DUNGENESS

00:26:43.101 --> 00:26:44.970

00:26:45.036 --> 00:26:47.005
AND ENTANGLEMENTS OF THESE

00:26:47.072 --> 00:26:49.407
MAJESTIC MARINE MAMMALS.

00:26:49.474 --> 00:26:51.409
WHAT I WILL SAY ON THAT FRONT IS

00:26:51.476 --> 00:26:53.411
IT'S A COMPLICATED --

00:26:53.478 --> 00:26:55.013

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.881

INTERESTS OF THE PLAINTIFF THE

00:27:01.319 --> 00:27:02.988

00:27:11.896 --> 00:27:13.164
UNDERSTAND WHAT AN AGREEMENT IN

PRINCIPLE MIGHT LOOK LIKE.

00:27:15.166 --> 00:27:16.468

00:28:30.275 --> 00:28:31.476
HERE'S WHERE I THINK WE'RE GOING

00:28:31.543 --> 00:28:33.011
TO END UP.

00:28:33.078 --> 00:28:34.179

00:28:36.114 --> 00:28:39.050
A RESOLUTION TO THIS ISSUE OF

00:28:39.117 --> 00:28:40.485
THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN WELLS IN

00:28:40.552 --> 00:28:41.553

WE'RE SAVING WHALES.

00:28:47.559 --> 00:28:49.761

IN CALIFORNIA.

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:57.135
I THINK WE'RE ON THE VERGE OF A

00:28:57.202 --> 00:28:58.937

00:28:59.003 --> 00:29:01.139

AND KNOWING WE'RE SAVING WELLS

00:29:06.244 --> 00:29:08.546
AT THE SAME TIME I THINK WITH

00:30:46.811 --> 00:30:49.047
FORM TO MAKE SURE WE WHATEVER

00:30:49.113 --> 00:30:50.915
INFORMATION THAT YOU HAVE WE CAN.

00:30:50.982 --> 00:30:52.650
I UNDERSTAND AND THEN AND THEN

00:30:52.717 --> 00:30:54.252
GET BACK OUT YES.

00:30:54.319 --> 00:30:56.521
AT THE MOMENT I BELIEVE IT IS

00:30:56.588 --> 00:30:58.122
APPROPRIATE TO TALK ABOUT IT IN

00:30:58.189 --> 00:30:59.591
PUBLIC I WOULD WELCOME THE

00:30:59.657 --> 00:31:01.492
CHANCE TO COMMON.

00:31:01.559 --> 00:31:02.860
A SPEAK WITH YOUR OFFICES AND I

00:31:02.927 --> 00:31:04.829
THINK ALSO DO THIS IN A PUBLIC

00:31:04.896 --> 00:31:10.235
FORUM I THINK THERE'S A CREDIBLE

00:31:10.301 --> 00:31:11.402
ENDEAVOR.

00:31:11.469 --> 00:31:13.338
BY ALL THE PARTIES INVOLVED TO

00:31:13.404 --> 00:31:16.107
COME UP WITH A CREATIVE SOLUTION.

00:31:16.174 --> 00:31:18.543
THAT'S THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR.

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:21.145
AND THEN THE THE EXPERIMENTATION

00:31:21.212 --> 00:31:22.614
PERMIT THE EXPERIMENT PER THE

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:24.682
THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT THAT THAT

00:31:24.749 --> 00:31:25.250
IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE

00:31:25.316 --> 00:31:26.584
NEED.

00:31:26.651 --> 00:31:29.087
TO FIGURE PATHWAYS FOR A LITTLE

00:31:29.153 --> 00:31:31.823
BIT MORE BROADLY AS THE AS WE

00:31:31.889 --> 00:31:34.459
TRY AND EXPERIMENT WITH GEAR.

00:31:34.525 --> 00:31:36.461
WORKING WITH THE INDUSTRY

00:31:36.527 --> 00:31:36.995
WORKING WITH THE FLEET AND

00:31:37.061 --> 00:31:38.229
MOVING FORWARD.

00:31:38.296 --> 00:31:40.365
FINDING WAYS TO BE ABLE TO DO

00:31:40.431 --> 00:31:43.001
EXPERIMENTAL WORK AND RESEARCH

00:31:43.067 --> 00:31:43.968
WORK.

00:31:44.035 --> 00:31:45.603
IN CALIFORNIA MAKING SURE THAT

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:46.938
IT'S IN OUR WATERS INSTEAD OF

00:31:47.005 --> 00:31:48.506
HAVING TO GO MORE BROADLY IS

00:31:48.573 --> 00:31:49.674
SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS.

00:31:49.741 --> 00:31:51.042
IS AN ENDEAVOR THAT WE NEED TO

00:31:51.109 --> 00:31:52.610
WORK WITH YOUR AGENCY A KIND OF

00:31:52.677 --> 00:31:54.078
ACROSS AGENCIES.

00:31:54.145 --> 00:31:56.014
SECRETARY ON IT IN UNDERSTAND

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:57.448
HOW WE CAN BETTER.

00:31:57.515 --> 00:31:58.950
IMPLEMENT THOSE PERMITS SO THAT

00:31:59.017 --> 00:32:03.488
WE GET AND BE ABLE TO DO THAT.

00:32:03.554 --> 00:32:05.056
THIS QUICKLY AS WE CAN SO THAT'S

00:32:05.123 --> 00:32:06.524
JUST A SUBJECT THAT I THINK I'M

00:32:06.591 --> 00:32:07.925
HOPING THAT THIS COMMITTEE.

00:32:07.992 --> 00:32:09.460
WE'LL KEEP ON OUR RADAR SAID

00:32:09.527 --> 00:32:11.262
THAT WE WORK THROUGH IT IN THAT

00:32:11.329 --> 00:32:12.764
THAT WE COULD BE TALKING ABOUT

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:14.332
AS WE NEED TO WORK WITH

00:32:14.399 --> 00:32:15.566
DIFFERENT AGENCIES.

00:32:15.633 --> 00:32:17.268
ON BUT I THINK THAT'S THAT'S

00:32:17.335 --> 00:32:18.136
SOMETHING I'M VERY INTERESTED AT

00:32:18.202 --> 00:32:19.003
THIS POINT.

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:19.904
SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT

00:32:19.971 --> 00:32:22.407
UP YOU BET AND WE WERE ACTUALLY

00:32:22.473 --> 00:32:24.542
PRETTY RECENTLY ABLE TO DO ONE

00:32:24.609 --> 00:32:26.144
OF OUR FIRST AND ONLY

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:28.079
EXPERIMENTAL GEAR PERMITS FOR A

00:32:28.146 --> 00:32:29.981
BOX CRAB FISHERY --

00:32:30.048 --> 00:32:31.482
IT TOOK ABOUT TWO LEGISLATIVE

00:32:31.549 --> 00:32:33.518
SESSIONS TO WORK OUT A BILL AND

00:32:33.584 --> 00:32:34.752
TO BE HONEST OUR DEPARTMENT

00:32:34.819 --> 00:32:37.155
HELLO HISTORICAL RESISTANCE.

00:32:37.221 --> 00:32:38.289
INTERNALLY TO THE IDEA OF

00:32:38.356 --> 00:32:40.024
EXPERIMENTING.

00:32:40.091 --> 00:32:41.025
AND I ACTUALLY THINK NOW THAT WE

00:32:41.092 --> 00:32:42.226
HAVE THIS LEGISLATIVE STRUCTURE

00:32:42.293 --> 00:32:43.828
IN PLACE YOU'LL SEE A RULE

00:32:43.895 --> 00:32:45.296
MAKING FROM US.

00:32:45.363 --> 00:32:46.597
WE'VE BEEN COLLABORATING ON WITH

00:32:46.664 --> 00:32:47.665
THE NATURE CONSERVANCY THAT A

00:32:47.732 --> 00:32:50.101
LAY OUT THE EXPEDITED PATHWAY.

00:32:50.168 --> 00:32:51.836
FOR DOING MORE EXPERIMENTAL

00:32:51.903 --> 00:32:53.271
PURPOSES OFFSHORE.

00:32:53.338 --> 00:32:55.106
GOOD BECAUSE AS WE SORT THROUGH

00:32:55.173 --> 00:32:56.908
SOME OF THESE ISSUES WE NEED TO

00:32:56.974 --> 00:32:58.509
BE DOING THESE THINGS HERE.

00:32:58.576 --> 00:32:59.944
IN WAYS THAT THAT WE FIND

00:33:00.011 --> 00:33:01.446
ACCEPTABLE WITH REALLY ALL THE

00:33:01.512 --> 00:33:03.981
STAKEHOLDERS AND SO I I

00:33:04.048 --> 00:33:04.816
DEFINITELY APPRECIATE THAT

00:33:04.882 --> 00:33:05.883
THANKS.

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:07.585
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE

00:33:07.652 --> 00:33:07.852
PRESSURE.

00:33:07.919 --> 00:33:08.653
SYSTEM [inaudible]

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:10.988
RIGHT.

00:33:11.055 --> 00:33:13.624
DOESN'T COME INTO QUESTIONS ON A

00:33:13.691 --> 00:33:15.493
FEW ITEMS AND IS GOING TO DO A

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:16.361
LITTLE BIT OF SHOCK ON APPROACH

00:33:16.427 --> 00:33:20.164
WORKS WE ALL ON THIS --

00:33:20.231 --> 00:33:20.765
TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE TOP

00:33:20.832 --> 00:33:21.733
ISSUE SAID.

00:33:21.799 --> 00:33:23.668
THE EJECTOR TOUCHED ON AS WELL

00:33:23.735 --> 00:33:27.105
AS ITEMS FOR THE YEAR AHEAD.

00:33:27.171 --> 00:33:28.706
LEANING FEES --

00:33:28.773 --> 00:33:29.607
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WANTS TO

00:33:29.674 --> 00:33:31.542
REPEAT BUT WE HAD A TWENTY FOUR

00:33:31.609 --> 00:33:32.777
MONTHS AGO PLAYING THE FEES.

00:33:32.844 --> 00:33:34.712
NO CERTAINLY NOT HAVE THAT

00:33:34.779 --> 00:33:37.749
FISHERMEN DON'T AND I ALSO KNOW --

00:33:37.815 --> 00:33:38.249
THE DIRECTOR DOESN'T --

00:33:38.316 --> 00:33:40.985
AS HE CONTINUES SO --

00:33:41.052 --> 00:33:44.322
LONG STORY SHORT --

00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:45.623
WE WANT TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:48.059
WE GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE CAN

00:33:48.126 --> 00:33:49.260
INCREMENTALLY.

00:33:49.327 --> 00:33:52.330
LOOK AT AN ANNUAL INCREASE.

00:33:52.397 --> 00:33:53.831
I EVERY OTHER YEAR INCREASE

00:33:53.898 --> 00:33:55.333
THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT THE

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:56.667
COMMITTEES CAN BE FOCUSING ON

00:33:56.734 --> 00:33:58.970
THIS YEAR BECAUSE IF WE JUST

00:33:59.036 --> 00:34:01.139
LOOK AT FREEZE WE'RE GONNA END

00:34:01.205 --> 00:34:02.740
UP IN THE SAME PLACE.

00:34:02.807 --> 00:34:03.307
AND JUST --

00:34:03.374 --> 00:34:07.445
YOUR EARLY THOUGHT ON THAT.

00:34:07.512 --> 00:34:09.914
AS A MEMBER OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE

00:34:09.981 --> 00:34:11.349
TO YOU LIVE THROUGH THE FEE

00:34:11.416 --> 00:34:13.985
INCREASE EXPERIENCE LIKE I DID.

00:34:14.051 --> 00:34:15.453
DON'T WANT TO DO THAT AGAIN YEAH

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:17.288
I'M AWARE OF LEGISLATION THAT

00:34:17.355 --> 00:34:18.456
SUGGESTS THERE'S A WAY TO

00:34:18.523 --> 00:34:20.725
INCREMENTALLY INCREASE FROM THE

00:34:20.792 --> 00:34:21.959
BASELINE OF TODAY.

00:34:22.026 --> 00:34:24.095
HERE TO SOME INDEX IT EXACTLY --

00:34:24.162 --> 00:34:25.430
I THINK THAT'S WORTH CONSIDERING

00:34:25.496 --> 00:34:26.564
AND OF COURSE WITHIN THE

00:34:26.631 --> 00:34:28.065
ADMINISTRATION WE HAVE A SYSTEM

00:34:28.132 --> 00:34:29.767
TO THINK THROUGH ALL PROPOSED

00:34:29.834 --> 00:34:30.902
LEGISLATION.

00:34:30.968 --> 00:34:32.570
YEAH I. N. M. LOOK NOT TRYING TO

00:34:32.637 --> 00:34:35.173
ADVOCATE FOR AT THE MOMENT I

00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:36.641
JUST THINK THAT --

00:34:36.707 --> 00:34:37.942
THE PASS IS ALWAYS A PRETTY GOOD

00:34:38.009 --> 00:34:39.610
PREDICTOR OF WHAT THE FUTURE IS

00:34:39.677 --> 00:34:41.012
GONNA LOOK LIKE AND THIS LEARN

00:34:41.078 --> 00:34:42.447
FROM THOSE LESSONS SO THAT WE

00:34:42.513 --> 00:34:43.781
DON'T END UP --

00:34:43.848 --> 00:34:45.149
IN THAT SAME SEAT AGREE AND ONE

00:34:45.216 --> 00:34:47.919
OF THE COMPOUNDING FACTORS LAST

00:34:47.985 --> 00:34:49.821
DISCUSSION AROUND WAS IT HAD

00:34:49.887 --> 00:34:52.056
BEEN SO LONG SINCE EXACTLY AND I

00:34:52.123 --> 00:34:54.225
THINK THE IDEA IS RESPONSIVE TO

00:34:54.292 --> 00:34:56.594
THAT.

00:34:56.661 --> 00:34:57.361
DR.

00:34:57.428 --> 00:34:59.464
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:00.565
I'M LIKE YOU DO A LITTLE BIT OF

00:35:00.631 --> 00:35:01.666
A DEEPER DIVE IN THE SERVICE

00:35:01.732 --> 00:35:02.767
BASED BUDGETING WHAT THAT'S

00:35:02.834 --> 00:35:04.168
GOING TO MEAN A FISHERY BY

00:35:04.235 --> 00:35:05.703
FISHERY.

00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:06.871
I SO IF YOU CAN JUST --

00:35:06.938 --> 00:35:08.406
TALK TO THE COMMITTEE TODAY WHAT

00:35:08.473 --> 00:35:10.975
I AM ABOUT THE FISHERY BY

00:35:11.042 --> 00:35:12.343
FISHERY --

00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:15.313
BUDGET MANAGEMENT THAT YOU'RE

00:35:15.379 --> 00:35:15.947
NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO DO I THINK

00:35:16.013 --> 00:35:16.781
THAT. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES TO

00:35:16.848 --> 00:35:17.949
THAT WE HAD A LONG DISCUSSION

00:35:18.015 --> 00:35:21.819
OVER DURING MEANING FEES THE

00:35:21.886 --> 00:35:23.688
DISCUSSION CERTAINLY ANY FEES IS.

00:35:23.754 --> 00:35:25.022
EACH FISHERIES KIND OF LUMPED

00:35:25.089 --> 00:35:28.593
INTO ONE POT I'M BEING UP.

00:35:28.659 --> 00:35:30.261
WAIT GENERAL THE MOMENT.

00:35:30.328 --> 00:35:31.729
THIS SERVICE FACE BHAJAN IS

00:35:31.796 --> 00:35:33.297
GOING TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW THE

00:35:33.364 --> 00:35:34.465
DEPARTMENT TO FOCUSON

00:35:34.532 --> 00:35:36.934
INDIVIDUAL FISHERIES I BELIEVE

00:35:37.001 --> 00:35:37.535
IF YOU CAN JUST TOUCH BASE ON

00:35:37.602 --> 00:35:38.469
THAT.

00:35:38.536 --> 00:35:41.405
SO IT'S A IT'S A MOUTHFUL TO SAY

00:35:41.472 --> 00:35:43.207
SERVICE BASED BUDGETING AND WHEN

00:35:43.274 --> 00:35:44.675
I SAY IT MOST PEOPLE'S EYES

00:35:44.742 --> 00:35:46.310
GLOSS OVER.

00:35:46.377 --> 00:35:48.012
BUT IT TURNS OUT IT'S AN ACTUAL

00:35:48.079 --> 00:35:49.380
BUSINESS DISCIPLINE.

00:35:49.447 --> 00:35:50.548
THE LLOYD IS PROBABLY THE

00:35:50.615 --> 00:35:52.850
PRIMERA DITTY THAT'S DOING IT IN

00:35:52.917 --> 00:35:54.519
THE GOVERNMENT SECTOR.

00:35:54.585 --> 00:35:56.287
THE BUDGET ACT INSTRUCTS ME TO

00:35:56.354 --> 00:35:58.022
HER HIRE A CONSULTANT WE'VE

00:35:58.089 --> 00:35:59.490
HEARD THEM.

00:35:59.557 --> 00:36:01.926
AND AS I SEE THE PRODUCT.

00:36:01.993 --> 00:36:05.096
THE OUTCOME IS AN EXHAUSTIVE

00:36:05.162 --> 00:36:06.831
LIST OF TASKS.

00:36:06.898 --> 00:36:08.799
THAT OCCUR WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT.

00:36:08.866 --> 00:36:11.102
CONNECTED TO PROGRAM AND PURPOSE

00:36:11.168 --> 00:36:13.671
WHICH IN MY MIND IN THIS CASE.

00:36:13.738 --> 00:36:15.306
WILL ALLOW US TO SEE THE FISHERY

00:36:15.373 --> 00:36:18.175
SPECIFIC YOU KNOW ORGANIZATION.

00:36:18.242 --> 00:36:20.177
AND THEN YOU COMPARE THOSE TWO

00:36:20.244 --> 00:36:22.547
LEVELS OF INFORMATION TO WHAT

00:36:22.613 --> 00:36:25.249
YOUR CURRENT LEVEL OF SERVICE.

00:36:25.316 --> 00:36:26.984
AND WHAT'S KIND OF YOUR OPTIMAL

00:36:27.051 --> 00:36:28.953
LEVEL OF SERVICE.

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:30.021
AND LOOKING AT THE PARKS

00:36:30.087 --> 00:36:31.689
DEPARTMENT WHICH USE SOMETHING

00:36:31.756 --> 00:36:33.791
SIMILAR YOU GET A PUBLIC FACING

00:36:33.858 --> 00:36:35.393
DASHBOARD.

00:36:35.459 --> 00:36:37.094
THAT ALLOWS YOU TO UNDERSTAND

00:36:37.161 --> 00:36:38.429
AND EXPLORE THAT INFORMATION

00:36:38.496 --> 00:36:40.197
REAL TIME.

00:36:40.264 --> 00:36:41.766
AND SEE HOW THE DEPARTMENT IS

00:36:41.832 --> 00:36:44.268
ANALYZING TASKS REVENUE.

00:36:44.335 --> 00:36:45.903
FISHERIES SECTOR IF YOU WILL

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:46.837
YEAH.

00:36:46.904 --> 00:36:48.806
CURRENT AN OPTIMAL.

00:36:48.873 --> 00:36:52.310
AND THAT'S WHERE WE'RE HEADED --

00:36:52.376 --> 00:36:53.978
WE HAVE A FAIR AMOUNT OF WORK

00:36:54.045 --> 00:36:55.379
LEFT IS A LONG WAY TO GO LET'S

00:36:55.446 --> 00:36:57.048
BE HONEST TO ME JUST SO I CAN IN

00:36:57.114 --> 00:36:57.615
THE IN.

00:36:57.682 --> 00:36:59.584
THE EARLY DAYS OF THIS RIGHT BUT

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:01.285
I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE

00:37:01.352 --> 00:37:02.853
TO GO AND IT PROVIDES.

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:04.488
LOOK BOTTOM LINE IT HELPS THE

00:37:04.555 --> 00:37:06.057
DEPARTMENT ON WHERE THEY'RE

00:37:06.123 --> 00:37:07.391
SPENDING THE TIME.

00:37:07.458 --> 00:37:09.827
AND WHAT WE ALL NOW IS TIME IS

00:37:09.894 --> 00:37:11.095
MONEY -- AND

00:37:11.162 --> 00:37:13.431
IT ALSO PROVIDES THE PUBLIC AND

00:37:13.497 --> 00:37:14.432
THE FISHING COMMUNITY

00:37:14.498 --> 00:37:16.100
TRANSPARENCY YESTERDAY TO GET A

00:37:16.167 --> 00:37:17.401
BETTER UNDERSTANDING ON WHAT

00:37:17.468 --> 00:37:18.636
TIME YOU SPEND A NIGHT ON

00:37:18.703 --> 00:37:20.304
ANCHOVIES VERSUS CRAP FOR

00:37:20.371 --> 00:37:22.640
EXAMPLE MMHM AND THIS IS RISKY

00:37:22.707 --> 00:37:24.075
THINK ABOUT IT FROM OUR SIDE.

00:37:24.141 --> 00:37:25.943
I HAVE FOUND --

00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:27.511
COMING FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR

00:37:27.578 --> 00:37:28.946
TO THIS PUBLIC SECTOR POSITION

00:37:29.013 --> 00:37:30.414
THAT.

00:37:30.481 --> 00:37:32.216
YOU KNOW IT THERE'S A A LEVEL OF

00:37:32.283 --> 00:37:33.851
NERVOUSNESS WHEN YOU'RE LAYING

00:37:33.918 --> 00:37:36.253
OUT ALL YOUR EXPENDITURES RIGHT

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:36.988
SURE.

00:37:37.054 --> 00:37:38.723
AND I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY

00:37:38.789 --> 00:37:40.257
SOMETHING TO BE EMBRACED AND

00:37:40.324 --> 00:37:42.126
THIS PROCESS WILL ALLOW US TO DO

00:37:42.193 --> 00:37:43.561
THAT AFFIRMATIVELY.

00:37:43.628 --> 00:37:45.296
IN A SMART MANNER THAT'S

00:37:45.363 --> 00:37:46.864
UNDERSTANDABLE WE HAVE A

00:37:46.931 --> 00:37:48.432
CONFUSING BUDGET.

00:37:48.499 --> 00:37:51.502
AND WE HAVE ALREADY PUT A LOT OF

00:37:51.569 --> 00:37:53.037
THE INFORMATION WE GENERATED ON

00:37:53.104 --> 00:37:55.473
A PUBLICFACING WEBPAGE WILDLIFE

00:37:55.539 --> 00:37:56.807
DOT CA DOT GOV.

00:37:56.874 --> 00:37:58.542
BACKSLASH BUDGET BACKSLASH

00:37:58.609 --> 00:38:00.344
SERVICE BASED BUDGETING.

00:38:00.411 --> 00:38:01.345
AND WE'RE WELCOMING THE INPUT

00:38:01.412 --> 00:38:05.850
AND THAT WEB LINK.

00:38:05.916 --> 00:38:06.684
AS I MENTIONED WE'VE GOT A

00:38:06.751 --> 00:38:08.252
SERIES OF PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT

00:38:08.319 --> 00:38:09.720
SCHEDULED I LOVE A CHANCE TO

00:38:09.787 --> 00:38:11.188
TALK AND SUB TO INSULT THREE

00:38:11.255 --> 00:38:12.223
ABOUT IT.

00:38:12.289 --> 00:38:14.592
I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF REALLY

00:38:14.659 --> 00:38:15.593
IMPORTANT ENGAGEMENT STILL TO BE

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:16.961
HAD.

00:38:17.028 --> 00:38:18.029
THREE THANK YOU.

00:38:18.095 --> 00:38:19.764
THAT COULD BE TO SWITCH GEARS

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:23.434
HERE TO CRAB INTO TESTING.

00:38:23.501 --> 00:38:24.735
REALLY HAVE A TWO STEP PROCESS

00:38:24.802 --> 00:38:26.971
WHERE BY YOUR DEPARTMENT MISTER

00:38:27.038 --> 00:38:29.206
DIRECTORS OUT THERE --

00:38:29.273 --> 00:38:30.675
WORKING WITH FISHERMEN WHO

00:38:30.741 --> 00:38:33.177
GENEROUSLY GIVE THEIR TIME TO BE

00:38:33.244 --> 00:38:34.745
ABLE TO GO CATCH THE SPECIMEN.

00:38:34.812 --> 00:38:36.847
WORKING WITH YOUR DEPARTMENT AND

00:38:36.914 --> 00:38:37.481
ULTIMATELY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC

00:38:37.548 --> 00:38:38.616
HEALTH --

00:38:38.683 --> 00:38:39.583
OVERSEEN THE TESTING.

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:43.554
ON I THINK THAT THERE'S STILL

00:38:43.621 --> 00:38:46.724
SOME GAP OF WHERE PUBLIC HEALTH

00:38:46.791 --> 00:38:48.492
NEEDS.

00:38:48.559 --> 00:38:49.293
TO BE IN REGARDS TO THEIR

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:52.396
FINDING UNDERSTAND THE DFW WAS --

00:38:52.463 --> 00:38:54.331
PROVIDED TO ENHANCE FUNNY BUT I

00:38:54.398 --> 00:38:55.332
THINK.

00:38:55.399 --> 00:38:57.368
AGAIN NO THIS IS SEPARATE FROM

00:38:57.435 --> 00:38:59.203
YOU BUT ALSO YOU'RE ATTACHED TO

00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:00.538
HIP WITH THE PH I THINK THAT'S

00:39:00.604 --> 00:39:01.939
THE ONE AREA THAT WE STILL NEED

00:39:02.006 --> 00:39:03.240
TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT IS.

00:39:03.307 --> 00:39:04.675
HOW TO BE A GIVE THEM ADEQUATE%

00:39:04.742 --> 00:39:05.710
RESOURCES BID TO COMPLETE THE

00:39:05.776 --> 00:39:07.445
TESTING ESPECIALLY IN A TIMELY

00:39:07.511 --> 00:39:08.713
MANNER -- IN

00:39:08.779 --> 00:39:10.514
AS WITH THE SECTORS TALK ABOUT

00:39:10.581 --> 00:39:11.682
DEMO CASTED.

00:39:11.749 --> 00:39:13.584
MY OPINION I THINK THAT WE WILL

00:39:13.651 --> 00:39:15.519
ALSO HEAR FROM.

00:39:15.586 --> 00:39:16.287
I'M -- THE

00:39:16.353 --> 00:39:19.457
CRABBERS IS THAT SOME CHALLENGES

00:39:19.523 --> 00:39:20.958
THERE IN REGARDS THE TIME MIGHT.

00:39:21.025 --> 00:39:23.427
ANY COMMENTS ON THAT YES THERE

00:39:23.494 --> 00:39:25.129
ARE STILL CHALLENGES THERE.

00:39:25.196 --> 00:39:27.765
YES THE OUTCOME DEPENDS ON

00:39:27.832 --> 00:39:28.733
GETTING INFORMATION AND

00:39:28.799 --> 00:39:30.868
PROCESSING IT QUICKLY.

00:39:30.935 --> 00:39:32.703
AND OFTEN THAT'S A FUNCTION OF

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:34.705
PEOPLE AVAILABLE IN LABS.

00:39:34.772 --> 00:39:36.574
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT TO SAY IT'S

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:38.242
A CONTINUING AREA OF CONCERN I'D

00:39:38.309 --> 00:39:39.510
LOVE A CHANCE TO GO OFF LINE

00:39:39.577 --> 00:39:40.945
TALK TO THE SECRETARY AND OUR

00:39:41.011 --> 00:39:42.546
COLLEAGUES ELSEWHERE PERFECT.

00:39:42.613 --> 00:39:44.048
AND KEEP WORKING ON THE TOPIC

00:39:44.115 --> 00:39:45.416
IT'S GREAT I'M GONNA I'M JUST A

00:39:45.483 --> 00:39:47.718
LITTLE BIT OF A PARKING LOT JUST

00:39:47.785 --> 00:39:48.352
SO WE CAN FOLLOW UP ON IT THANK

00:39:48.419 --> 00:39:51.055
YOU [inaudible]

00:39:51.122 --> 00:39:52.423
WHEN ENERGY?

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:53.424
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GONNA HAVE

00:39:53.491 --> 00:39:56.227
ANYONE ON THIS COMMITTEE --

00:39:56.293 --> 00:39:57.294
FOR MANY IN THE LEGISLATURE TO

00:39:57.361 --> 00:39:58.763
SAY THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO

00:39:58.829 --> 00:40:01.565
FOCUS ON RENEWAL AFFORDABLE

00:40:01.632 --> 00:40:03.467
RENEWABLE --

00:40:03.534 --> 00:40:05.703
SOURCES OF ENERGY FOR

00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:08.105
CALIFORNIANS.

00:40:08.172 --> 00:40:08.739
IN WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

00:40:08.806 --> 00:40:10.307
DO IT RIGHT --

00:40:10.374 --> 00:40:13.477
MAKING NEW SURE THAT WHEN WE ARE

00:40:13.544 --> 00:40:15.379
LOOKING AT THOSE TURBINES --

00:40:15.446 --> 00:40:17.548
INSENSITIVE OCEAN AREAS

00:40:17.615 --> 00:40:18.249
OBVIOUSLY THAT'S GONNA BE GOOD

00:40:18.315 --> 00:40:19.250
FOR THE GREATER.

00:40:19.316 --> 00:40:20.951
GOOD FOR A G. SHE IMPACT WE NEED

00:40:21.018 --> 00:40:22.686
TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S ALSO

00:40:22.753 --> 00:40:24.088
WORKING FOR VERY SENSITIVE

00:40:24.155 --> 00:40:26.490
HABITATS OFF OF OUR COAST IN HIS

00:40:26.557 --> 00:40:29.460
SON IMPACTING COMMERCIAL FISHING

00:40:29.527 --> 00:40:30.528
GROUNDS -- I

00:40:30.594 --> 00:40:31.162
DON'T KNOW IF YOU EITHER OF YOU

00:40:31.228 --> 00:40:32.930
HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THIS AND WE

00:40:32.997 --> 00:40:33.998
WILL BE HAVING THAT HEARING

00:40:34.064 --> 00:40:35.166
COMING UP ON THE THIRD UP IN

00:40:35.232 --> 00:40:36.400
EUREKA --

00:40:36.467 --> 00:40:37.568
BUT I JUST LIKE TO BE TO SEE IF

00:40:37.635 --> 00:40:39.103
YOU HAVE ANY EITHER ONE OF YOU

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:41.172
HAVE ANY THOUGHTS.

00:40:41.238 --> 00:40:42.306
I'VE BEEN ABLE TO BOUNCE RIGHT

00:40:42.373 --> 00:40:44.008
AT A BROAD LEVEL I THINK THE

00:40:44.074 --> 00:40:46.811
DIRECTOR INDICATED A PRIORITY IN

00:40:46.877 --> 00:40:48.379
HIS DEPARTMENT.

00:40:48.445 --> 00:40:49.914
FOR BEING CENTRELINK GAUGE IN

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:51.649
THIS MARINE SPATIAL PLANNING.

00:40:51.715 --> 00:40:53.150
ANDWE HAVE.

00:40:53.217 --> 00:40:54.285
TO THE OTHER DEPARTMENT OR

00:40:54.351 --> 00:40:55.519
ENTITY WITHIN THE RESOURCE

00:40:55.586 --> 00:40:57.054
AGENCY OF THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY

00:40:57.121 --> 00:40:57.788
COMMISSION.

00:40:57.855 --> 00:40:59.056
AND THEY'VE BEEN VERY THOUGHTFUL

00:40:59.123 --> 00:41:00.090
ABOUT THEIR APPROACH TO THIS

00:41:00.157 --> 00:41:01.692
THEY'VE DONE SOME LARGE SCALE

00:41:01.759 --> 00:41:03.961
ENERGY PLANNING ON LAND.

00:41:04.028 --> 00:41:05.329
AND THEY'RE FOCUSED IN

00:41:05.396 --> 00:41:08.232
PARTNERING WATER.

00:41:08.299 --> 00:41:09.533
IS OBVIOUSLY A FEDERAL DIMENSION

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:10.701
ON THIS AS WELL --

00:41:10.768 --> 00:41:12.102
SO I WELCOME YOUR LEGISLATIVE

00:41:12.169 --> 00:41:14.171
OVERSIGHT OF THIS AND JUST KNOW

00:41:14.238 --> 00:41:15.706
THAT THIS IS A PRIORITY WITHIN

00:41:15.773 --> 00:41:17.208
OUR AGENCY.

00:41:17.274 --> 00:41:19.577
THE ONLY ADDITIONAL THING I'D

00:41:19.643 --> 00:41:21.946
SAY IS FROM EXPERIENCE.

00:41:22.012 --> 00:41:23.347
HAVING LIVE THROUGH.

00:41:23.414 --> 00:41:25.349
MOST OF THE EFFORT TO PERMIT THE

00:41:25.416 --> 00:41:27.117
LARGE SCALE SOLAR ON THE LAND

00:41:27.184 --> 00:41:28.886
SIDE YEAH.

00:41:28.953 --> 00:41:30.354
WITH THE RIGHT MAPPING IN

00:41:30.421 --> 00:41:31.655
PLANNING AND THE RIGHT

00:41:31.722 --> 00:41:33.157
LEADERSHIP TO ENSURE WE'RE

00:41:33.224 --> 00:41:36.994
TALKING ACROSS OUR OUR BAND WITH.

00:41:37.061 --> 00:41:38.395
I FOUND THE SINGLE MOST

00:41:38.462 --> 00:41:40.264
IMPORTANT KIND DISCUSSION IS IS

00:41:40.331 --> 00:41:41.699
THE FOOTPRINT QUESTION WHERE DO

00:41:41.765 --> 00:41:43.033
YOU WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO PUT

00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:44.935
THE ASSET.

00:41:45.002 --> 00:41:46.036
AND IF YOU CAN ENSURE YOU'RE

00:41:46.103 --> 00:41:47.037
REALLY TALKING ABOUT THAT

00:41:47.104 --> 00:41:48.906
THOUGHTFULLY.

00:41:48.973 --> 00:41:50.841
YOU ALMOST ALWAYS CAN ACHIEVE

00:41:50.908 --> 00:41:52.676
BOTH OBJECTIVES.

00:41:52.743 --> 00:41:54.511
SENSITIVITY TO SPECIES AND

00:41:54.578 --> 00:41:57.681
HABITAT AND GREENING OUR GRID.

00:41:57.748 --> 00:41:59.750
AND A LOT OF THAT RESTS ON THE

00:41:59.817 --> 00:42:02.987
QUESTION AROUND CITING INFOPRINT.

00:42:03.053 --> 00:42:04.488
ABSOLUTELY AND I WOULD ONLY

00:42:04.555 --> 00:42:05.756
MENTION ONE OTHER IMPORTANT

00:42:05.823 --> 00:42:06.257
STAKEHOLDERS THE FEDERAL

00:42:06.323 --> 00:42:07.658
MILITARY.

00:42:07.725 --> 00:42:08.158
AND WE'LL CLOSE WORKING

00:42:08.225 --> 00:42:09.493
RELATIONSHIP WITH SEVERAL

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:10.961
FEDERAL MILITARY INSTALLATIONS

00:42:11.028 --> 00:42:12.062
THAT ARE DOING TESTING IN

00:42:12.129 --> 00:42:12.663
TRAINING.

00:42:12.730 --> 00:42:15.799
I AND WIND ENERGY.

00:42:15.866 --> 00:42:17.668
ARE PLACED IN THE WRONG --

00:42:17.735 --> 00:42:19.103
LOCATION CAN BE REALLY

00:42:19.169 --> 00:42:19.970
PROBLEMATIC --

00:42:20.037 --> 00:42:21.772
TO FLYING THE MILITARY PLANE SO

00:42:21.839 --> 00:42:23.574
WE'RE SENSITIVE TO THAT AND

00:42:23.641 --> 00:42:24.174
WE'RE ENGAGING THOSE FOLKS AS

00:42:24.241 --> 00:42:25.509
WELL.

00:42:25.576 --> 00:42:26.410
GREAT FOR I THINK THAT ONE OF

00:42:26.477 --> 00:42:27.077
THE AREAS THAT.

00:42:27.144 --> 00:42:28.312
WERE ALSO CAN WE FOCUS ON ARE

00:42:28.379 --> 00:42:31.115
THOSE LINES THAT NEED TO BE

00:42:31.181 --> 00:42:32.316
BUILT OUT SO FOR LOOKING AT THE

00:42:32.383 --> 00:42:33.417
NORTH COAST FOR EXAMPLE YOU'RE

00:42:33.484 --> 00:42:35.019
GOING THROUGH SOME OF THE MOST.

00:42:35.085 --> 00:42:36.921
SENSITIVE ECOSYSTEMS ON EARTH --

00:42:36.987 --> 00:42:38.622
AND WHAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE THERE

00:42:38.689 --> 00:42:39.857
TO BE ABLE TO GET WHATEVER

00:42:39.924 --> 00:42:41.158
ENERGY IS GOING TO BE.

00:42:41.225 --> 00:42:42.860
DEVELOPED OFF SHORE --

00:42:42.927 --> 00:42:45.129
INPUT INTO THE GENERAL GRADE

00:42:45.195 --> 00:42:46.163
IT'S GOING TO BE INCREDIBLY

00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:48.599
COSTLY BY THE WAY RIGHT AND

00:42:48.666 --> 00:42:49.533
WE'RE GONNA BE BUILDING THESE

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:51.368
TRANSMISSION LINES THROUGH SOME

00:42:51.435 --> 00:42:52.870
OF THE MOST SENSITIVE WATERSHEDS --

00:42:52.937 --> 00:42:57.241
WHICH ARE --

00:42:57.308 --> 00:42:58.208
SALMON BEARING HABITAT.

00:42:58.275 --> 00:43:00.110
AND SOME OF THE MOST SENSITIVE --

00:43:00.177 --> 00:43:01.712
FORCEFULLY AND WITH ENDANGERED

00:43:01.779 --> 00:43:03.247
SPECIES I THINK THAT'S THE OTHER

00:43:03.314 --> 00:43:04.648
AREA THAT WE WE NEED TO BE A

00:43:04.715 --> 00:43:06.583
FOCUS THAT WILL BE TOUCHING THE

00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:08.052
FOOTPRINT OF THE DIRECTOR'S.

00:43:08.118 --> 00:43:09.653
OFFICE AS WELL [inaudible]

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:12.189
I'M.

00:43:12.256 --> 00:43:14.525
SETTLEMENT KNOW THAT I YOU HAVE

00:43:14.591 --> 00:43:16.593
BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY --

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:19.496
ON THE SETTLEMENT.

00:43:19.563 --> 00:43:21.298
HAVE SOME CONCERNS ON WHAT THIS

00:43:21.365 --> 00:43:22.633
WILL LOOK LIKE --

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:25.235
AND I'M GRATEFUL THAT YOU HAVE

00:43:25.302 --> 00:43:27.571
BEEN A GREAT COMMUNICATOR WHEN

00:43:27.638 --> 00:43:29.340
YOU CAN BE ON AND WHEN IT'S

00:43:29.406 --> 00:43:30.574
APPROPRIATE.

00:43:30.641 --> 00:43:31.675
AND IN ONE OF THE ITEMS THAT WE

00:43:31.742 --> 00:43:34.578
LIKE TO BE ABLE TO HOST IS I CAN

00:43:34.645 --> 00:43:36.981
MEAN AND MEDIAN WITH --

00:43:37.047 --> 00:43:40.784
WITH THE DEPARTMENT ALONG --

00:43:40.851 --> 00:43:42.219
WORKING WITH MR OPPENHEIM HE

00:43:42.286 --> 00:43:43.721
BETTER COME IN AND SEE WHAT THIS

00:43:43.787 --> 00:43:46.223
LOOKS LIKE  AS WE MOVE FORWARD

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:46.790
I THINK.

00:43:46.857 --> 00:43:48.459
THAT MAY MEAN SOME ADDITIONAL

00:43:48.525 --> 00:43:50.561
RESOURCES IF WE'RE GOING TO ADD

00:43:50.627 --> 00:43:51.595
IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE

00:43:51.662 --> 00:43:53.464
SEASON WHAT THAT'S GOING TO MEAN

00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:54.231
TO BE ABLE TO GET FOLKS OUT IN

00:43:54.298 --> 00:43:55.099
THE WATER.

00:43:55.165 --> 00:43:58.235
AND WHAT WE CAN DO IF --

00:43:58.302 --> 00:43:59.536
THAT SEASON IS INTERRUPTED

00:43:59.603 --> 00:44:00.904
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THERE'S A

00:44:00.971 --> 00:44:02.406
LITTLE BIT MORE RUNWAY IF WE

00:44:02.473 --> 00:44:03.941
LOOK AT A DIFFERENT ARE SHORTER

00:44:04.008 --> 00:44:05.809
SEASON FOR EXAMPLE WHO KNOWS

00:44:05.876 --> 00:44:06.410
WHAT IS GOING TO BE.

00:44:06.477 --> 00:44:09.046
BUT THERE IS SOME GREAT CONCERN.

00:44:09.113 --> 00:44:10.447
FOR THE LIVELIHOOD IT'S OUR TOP

00:44:10.514 --> 00:44:13.650
TIER FISHERY WE HAVE AND THERE'S

00:44:13.717 --> 00:44:14.818
A LOT OF ANXIETY OUT THERE AS

00:44:14.885 --> 00:44:16.320
YOU ALL KNOW AND WANT TO MAKE

00:44:16.387 --> 00:44:17.388

OBVIOUSLY WITH A DEPARTMENT AND

00:44:20.758 --> 00:44:22.126
THOSE WHO WOULD BE IMPACTED BY

00:44:22.192 --> 00:44:23.927
THE SHORTENED SEASON AND OFF.

NOT WANTING TO BE A TO GET INTO

00:44:31.502 --> 00:44:32.903

THERE'S A VERY LEGITIMATE.

00:44:55.726 --> 00:44:57.861

LITIGATION POTENTIALLY IS AN

00:45:06.837 --> 00:45:08.705
EVEN GREATER RISKS TO CERTAIN

00:45:08.772 --> 00:45:10.841

THE PHASE ONE PROCESS WAS A

00:55:32.662 --> 00:55:33.730
NIGHTMARE.

00:55:33.797 --> 00:55:35.498
IT'S BEEN POLITICALLY COMPROMISE

00:55:35.565 --> 00:55:37.033
AND YET DESPITE THAT FACT THE

00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:38.768
WATER BOARD.

00:55:38.835 --> 00:55:41.771
CAME OUT WITH THE FIRST STRONG --

00:55:41.838 --> 00:55:43.707
PROTECTIVE.

00:55:43.773 --> 00:55:44.541
WATER QUALITY CONTROL PLAN FOR

00:55:44.607 --> 00:55:46.443
THE DELTA.

00:55:46.509 --> 00:55:48.211
IN THIRTY YEARS PERHAPS EVER

00:55:48.278 --> 00:55:49.145
SOME OF SAID THIS IS THE BEST

00:55:49.212 --> 00:55:50.113
THING THE WATER BOARD EVER DONE

00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:51.481
IN ITS HISTORY.

00:55:51.548 --> 00:55:53.349
AND NOW THAT'S COMROMISED --

00:55:53.416 --> 00:55:55.151
AND WE'RE STARTING TO SEE SIGNS

00:55:55.218 --> 00:55:57.754
THAT IF IF IF IF THINGS PROCEED

00:55:57.821 --> 00:55:59.189
AS THEY'RE GOING AND WE WILL

00:55:59.255 --> 00:56:00.790
LOSE TRANSPARENCY WILL LOSE THE

00:56:00.857 --> 00:56:02.025
PUBLIC NATURE OF THIS PROCESS.

00:56:02.092 --> 00:56:03.927
VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS

00:56:03.993 --> 00:56:04.594
CAN WORK.

00:56:04.661 --> 00:56:07.063
IF THEIR PUBLIC.

00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:08.865
AND IF THEY ARE.

00:56:08.932 --> 00:56:10.567
IF THEY VERIFIABLY IT HERE TO

00:56:10.633 --> 00:56:12.535
APPROPRIATE.

00:56:12.602 --> 00:56:13.870
MINIMUM FLOW STANDARDS.

00:56:13.937 --> 00:56:15.705
SO WE CAN GET THERE --

00:56:15.772 --> 00:56:16.539
BUT IT'S A IT'S A CRITICAL

00:56:16.606 --> 00:56:18.208
MOMENT THERE IN THE FISH NEED

00:56:18.274 --> 00:56:19.976
THIS WATER WE GRILL WATERS ON

00:56:20.043 --> 00:56:21.244
THE TABLE.

00:56:21.311 --> 00:56:22.145
IT'S TIME TO KEEP IT THERE

TO ECHO A LITTLE BIT ON SOME OF

00:57:11.928 --> 00:57:13.029
THE THEMES THAT --

00:57:13.096 --> 00:57:14.798
NO IT JUST SPOKE ABOUT ALTHOUGH

00:57:14.864 --> 00:57:16.065
WE'RE OUT OF THE WOODS FOR THE

00:57:16.132 --> 00:57:17.600
MOMENT WITH GOOD WATER YEARS --

00:57:17.667 --> 00:57:18.601
WE WERE.

00:57:18.668 --> 00:57:20.303
BADLY SCARRED DURING THE LAST

00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:21.704
DROUGHT AND WE WANT TO TAKE

00:57:21.771 --> 00:57:23.173
STEPS NOW TO AVOID THAT IN THE

00:57:23.239 --> 00:57:24.440
FUTURE --

00:57:24.507 --> 00:57:25.742
SACRAMENTO BEE HEADLINE FROM

BUNCH OF HEADACHES DESPITE.

00:57:29.946 --> 00:57:31.514
LAST MINUTE WATER DEALS BY BROWN

00:57:31.581 --> 00:57:34.484
SOME HAVE SAID BECAUSE OF LAST

00:57:34.551 --> 00:57:36.586
MINUTE WATER DEALS BY BROWN --

00:57:36.653 --> 00:57:38.254
TOPIC OF DEBATE THIS GOES TO THE

00:57:38.321 --> 00:57:39.489
BSA IS THAT WHERE YOU WANT TO

00:57:39.556 --> 00:57:40.990
TALK ABOUT.

00:57:41.057 --> 00:57:41.858
THE GOLDEN GATE SALMON

00:57:41.925 --> 00:57:43.827
ASSOCIATION AND ALLIES PREPARED

00:57:43.893 --> 00:57:46.196
AN ANALYSIS OF THE V. ESSAYS

00:57:46.262 --> 00:57:46.830
WHICH WERE HAPPY TO SHARE WITH

00:57:46.896 --> 00:57:47.630
ALL OF YOU.

00:57:47.697 --> 00:57:49.199
AND BASICALLY WHAT WE FOUND IS

00:57:49.265 --> 00:57:50.733
THAT THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY MAKE

00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:52.368
CONDITIONS WORSE FOR THE BAY

00:57:52.435 --> 00:57:57.207
DELTA RIVERS SALMON AND WILDLIFE --

00:57:57.273 --> 00:57:59.742
WE WEREN'T THE ONLY ONES THERE

00:57:59.809 --> 00:58:00.076
WERE OTHER --

00:58:00.143 --> 00:58:01.578
CONSERVATION GROUPS.

00:58:01.644 --> 00:58:03.346
CLOSURE AGREEMENTS THAT HAVE

00:58:03.413 --> 00:58:04.080
BEEN PART OF THE VOLUNTARY

00:58:04.147 --> 00:58:05.682
SETTLEMENT PROCESS FOR THE LAST

00:58:05.748 --> 00:58:07.517
COUPLE YEARS INCLUDING TROUT

00:58:07.584 --> 00:58:09.118
UNLIMITED THE NATURE CONSERVANCY

00:58:09.185 --> 00:58:10.587
THE BAY INSTITUTE.

ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE DEFENDERS

00:58:12.655 --> 00:58:14.224
OF WILDLIFE IN AMERICAN RIVERS

00:58:14.290 --> 00:58:15.558
THEY BASICALLY FOUND SIMILAR

00:58:15.625 --> 00:58:17.660
THINGS TO WHAT WE DID THE TOP

00:58:17.727 --> 00:58:19.062
FINDINGS OR THE AMOUNT OF WATER.

00:58:19.128 --> 00:58:20.430
ALLEGED TO BE SHIFTED TO THE

00:58:20.496 --> 00:58:23.132
ENVIRONMENT IN THESE NEW

00:58:23.199 --> 00:58:24.267
VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS.

00:58:24.334 --> 00:58:25.335
SHE DOESN'T MEET THE LEGAL AND

00:58:25.401 --> 00:58:26.703
SCIENTIFIC REQUIREMENTS OF THE

00:58:26.769 --> 00:58:28.137
STATE BOARD IT DOESN'T MEAN

00:58:28.204 --> 00:58:28.738
THESE --

00:58:28.805 --> 00:58:30.106
VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS

00:58:30.173 --> 00:58:31.574
CAN'T YET BE NEGOTIATED AND

00:58:31.641 --> 00:58:33.776
MODIFIED HOPEFULLY THEY WILL BE

00:58:33.843 --> 00:58:34.911
BUT AS THEY STAND TODAY THEY'RE

00:58:34.978 --> 00:58:35.979
NOT THERE YET.

00:58:36.045 --> 00:58:37.247
THERE IS DISAGREEMENT OVER WHAT

00:58:37.313 --> 00:58:39.749
CONSTITUTES BASELINE CONDITIONS

00:58:39.816 --> 00:58:40.850
THAT'S IMPORTANT.

00:58:40.917 --> 00:58:42.585
IN THE PROPOSALS ARE UNCLEAR ON

00:58:42.652 --> 00:58:44.354
HOW TO PROTECT ANY ADDITIONAL

00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:45.755
WATER FROM BEING DIVERTED IN THE

00:58:45.822 --> 00:58:47.457
DELTA SO ONE OF THE VOLUNTARY

00:58:47.523 --> 00:58:48.458
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS WE COULD

00:58:48.524 --> 00:58:50.026
SEE SOME ADDITIONAL WATER PUT

00:58:50.093 --> 00:58:52.028
INTO THE CENTRAL VALLEY ONLY

00:58:52.095 --> 00:58:55.265
LOOK TO LOSE IT IN THE DAY --

00:58:55.331 --> 00:58:57.667
RESTRICTIONS ON EXPORTS DOWN

00:58:57.734 --> 00:58:58.801
THERE MEANWHILE THE TRUMP

00:58:58.868 --> 00:59:00.203
ADMINISTRATION IS MOVING TO

00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:01.971
INCREASE DELTA PUMPING RIGHT NOW

00:59:02.038 --> 00:59:03.673
AS WE SPEAK.

00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:04.741
MODELING BY THE U. S. BUREAU OF

00:59:04.807 --> 00:59:06.709
RECLAMATION SHOWS THAT THE

00:59:06.776 --> 00:59:08.077
VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT FLOWS.

00:59:08.144 --> 00:59:09.412
COMBINED WITH WITH THE TRUMP

00:59:09.479 --> 00:59:11.381
ADMINISTRATION IS NOW PROPOSING

00:59:11.447 --> 00:59:12.615
WOULD REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF WATER

00:59:12.682 --> 00:59:14.484
FLOWING THROUGH THE DELTA WE MAY

00:59:14.550 --> 00:59:15.752
GET MORE OF THESE BLUE GREEN

00:59:15.818 --> 00:59:17.520
ALGAE OUTBREAKS WHICH IS WHAT

00:59:17.587 --> 00:59:18.655
YOU'RE SEEING IN THIS PICTURE

00:59:18.721 --> 00:59:19.088
HERE.

00:59:19.155 --> 00:59:20.390
THAT'S SHUT UP --

00:59:20.456 --> 00:59:21.891
NEAR OAKLEY IN THE DELTA BLUE

00:59:21.958 --> 00:59:23.259
GREEN ALGAE --

00:59:23.326 --> 00:59:24.994
FOR LACK OF FRESH WATER LACK OF

00:59:25.061 --> 00:59:26.829
FLUSHING FLOWS THAT WAS DURING

00:59:26.896 --> 00:59:29.299
THE DROUGHT WE COULD BE BACK IN

00:59:29.365 --> 00:59:30.566
THERE VERY SOON.

00:59:30.633 --> 00:59:31.601
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

00:59:31.668 --> 00:59:33.169
PROPOSALS ARE ALL REALLY JUST SO

00:59:33.236 --> 00:59:34.470
THEY CAN SEND MORE WATER SOUTH

00:59:34.537 --> 00:59:37.073
TO THE VERY ARID WESTERN SAN

00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:37.307
JOAQUIN.

00:59:37.373 --> 00:59:40.143
VALLEY.

00:59:40.209 --> 00:59:40.710
I'M NOT GONNA GET INTO THE

00:59:40.777 --> 00:59:42.445
NUMBERS I JUST WANT TO HAVE YOU

00:59:42.512 --> 00:59:43.680
LOOK AT THE RED.

00:59:43.746 --> 00:59:44.814
THIS IS FROM THE BUREAU OF

00:59:44.881 --> 00:59:46.182
RECLAMATION THIS IS THEIR

00:59:46.249 --> 00:59:48.017
ESTIMATE OF HOW MUCH LESS WATER

00:59:48.084 --> 00:59:48.985
WOULD SEE.

00:59:49.052 --> 00:59:51.154
IN THE DELTA UNDER PROPOSALS

00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:53.189
CURRENTLY UNDER THE TABLE OR ON

00:59:53.256 --> 00:59:54.490
THE TABLES WHEN I MEANT TO SAY.

00:59:54.557 --> 00:59:56.092
YEAH THAT'S QUITE A BIT OF WATER

00:59:56.159 --> 00:59:58.194
THAT WE COULD STAND TO LOSE WITH

00:59:58.261 --> 01:00:00.263
WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW.

01:00:00.330 --> 01:00:01.998
SO ONE SOLUTION --

01:00:02.065 --> 01:00:03.766
THE WE'D LIKE TO HELP YOUR ADS

01:00:03.833 --> 01:00:05.568

AND CONSUMERS FROM THE HARMFUL

01:00:13.443 --> 01:00:15.044
CONSEQUENCES OF RECKLESS

01:00:15.111 --> 01:00:16.112
DEREGULATION AT THE FEDERAL

01:00:16.179 --> 01:00:17.647
LEVEL THIS BILL IS FRONT OF THE

01:00:17.714 --> 01:00:19.082
LEGISLATURE RIGHT NOW IT WOULD

01:00:19.148 --> 01:00:22.652
GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS HELPING US.

01:00:22.719 --> 01:00:23.720
I WOULD TURN MY ATTENTION TO

01:00:23.786 --> 01:00:25.421
WELL THE SITE'S RESERVOIR

01:00:25.488 --> 01:00:27.657
PROPOSAL JUST FOR A QUICK SECOND --

01:00:27.724 --> 01:00:28.925
AND JUST POINT OUT WITHOUT

01:00:28.992 --> 01:00:30.360
GETTING INTO DETAIL THAT --

01:00:30.426 --> 01:00:31.661
YOU'LL HEAR A LOT OF ROSIE

01:00:31.728 --> 01:00:33.262
THINGS ABOUT SITES OF THE

01:00:33.329 --> 01:00:34.897
LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE AWARE OF

01:00:34.964 --> 01:00:35.898
THIS LETTER SENT BY THE

01:00:35.965 --> 01:00:37.133
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.067

01:00:38.134 --> 01:00:41.371
BACK IN JANUARY OF TWENTY

01:00:41.437 --> 01:00:42.638
EIGHTEEN KLAY SAID --

01:00:42.705 --> 01:00:44.140
HIGHER BYPASS FLOWS WOULD BE

01:00:44.207 --> 01:00:47.276
NEEDED BEFORE SITES COULD DIVERT --

01:00:47.343 --> 01:00:49.012
WHAT CDF W. IS CALLING ON IS

01:00:49.078 --> 01:00:51.581
ABOUT TWICE THE BY PASS FLOWS

01:00:51.647 --> 01:00:53.616
ENVISIONED BY THE?

01:00:53.683 --> 01:00:54.917

01:00:54.984 --> 01:00:56.285
A AND DOES SO FOR THE SITE'S

01:00:56.352 --> 01:00:57.954
FOLKS HAVE NOT TAKEN THESE

01:00:58.021 --> 01:01:00.123
PROPOSALS AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO

01:01:00.189 --> 01:01:01.791
HEART AND THEY NEED TO GOING

01:01:01.858 --> 01:01:03.292
FORWARD --

01:01:03.359 --> 01:01:05.061
FINALLY I JUST WANT TO TOUCH ON

01:01:05.128 --> 01:01:06.562
ONE OF OUR FAVORIT TOPICS THAT

01:01:06.629 --> 01:01:07.630
YOU'VE HEARD ME ADDRESS EVERY

01:01:07.697 --> 01:01:08.931
TIME I'VE BEEN HERE.

01:01:08.998 --> 01:01:09.999
AND THAT IS --

01:01:10.066 --> 01:01:11.100
THE FEATHER RIVER BELOW THE

01:01:11.167 --> 01:01:13.169
ORVILLE DAM AND THE HOT WATER

01:01:13.236 --> 01:01:14.604
THAT'S POURING INTO THE RIVER

01:01:14.670 --> 01:01:17.407
OUT OF THE THERMAL LIDO AFTER

01:01:17.473 --> 01:01:18.708
BAY -- RIGHT

01:01:18.775 --> 01:01:20.243
NOW -- ALL

01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:22.045
PARTIES HAVE AGREED TO FIX THIS

THE OTHER THING THAT I'VE BEEN A

01:02:26.642 --> 01:02:27.510
PART OF HIS THE CAL BARGING

01:02:27.577 --> 01:02:30.046
PROGRAM AND I WAS REALLY HAPPY

01:02:30.113 --> 01:02:31.047
TO BE A PART OF THAT.

01:02:31.114 --> 01:02:32.415
THE MOST INTERESTING THING THAT

01:02:32.482 --> 01:02:33.883
EVERY YEAR THAT WE DID BARGING

01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:35.318
DOWN RIVER WE WERE ABLE TO LEARN

01:02:35.384 --> 01:02:36.486
A WHOLE LOT ABOUT WHAT WE COULD

01:02:36.552 --> 01:02:37.920
DO IN THE SYSTEM HOW TO TAKE

01:02:37.987 --> 01:02:39.455
CARE OF THE FISH OUT A RELEASE

01:02:39.522 --> 01:02:41.624
THE FISH WERE RELEASED EFFICIENT --

01:02:41.691 --> 01:02:43.359
LEARNING WHAT TIME IS TIDES OR

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:45.094
WHATEVER WOULD BE THE BEST FOR

01:02:45.161 --> 01:02:46.095
THE FASHION.

01:02:46.162 --> 01:02:47.964
BY DOING THAT EVERY YEAR WE ARE

01:02:48.030 --> 01:02:49.265
ABLE TO LIVE THAT.

01:02:49.332 --> 01:02:50.533
I'VE HEARD THAT --

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:50.766
THURS --

01:02:50.833 --> 01:02:52.869
SOME OF THE LOCAL PEOPLE ARE

01:02:52.935 --> 01:02:54.604
HERE TO TRY TO INFLUENCE WHERE

01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:56.706
WE DO RELEASE FISH OUT OF THE

01:02:56.772 --> 01:03:00.409
TRUCKS THIS YEAR IN CASE ---WE'RE DUMPING DRUNK FISH INTO A

01:03:00.476 --> 01:03:01.711
BAD SPOT.

01:03:01.777 --> 01:03:02.278
PLACE WHERE THERE'S A WHOLE

01:03:02.345 --> 01:03:03.880
BUNCH OF STRIPERS BE NICE TO

01:03:03.946 --> 01:03:04.847
FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE TO DUMP THE

01:03:04.914 --> 01:03:05.615
FISH.

01:03:05.681 --> 01:03:07.383
RATHER THAN RIGHT IN THIS SPOT.

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:09.051
IF WE DUMP A TRUCKLOAD OF FISH

01:03:09.118 --> 01:03:11.120
RIGHT ON TOP OF THE STRIKERS WE

01:03:11.187 --> 01:03:13.256
TALKED ABOUT THIS LAST SUMMER --

01:03:13.322 --> 01:03:14.323
YOU KNOW.

01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:15.791
WE AS FISHERMEN DON'T CARE OF

01:03:15.858 --> 01:03:17.260
THE BIRDS CRAWFISH STRIPERS

01:03:17.326 --> 01:03:19.395
SEALS ARE WHALES EAT THE BABY

01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:21.197
FISH WE DON'T CARE OF THE SEA

01:03:21.264 --> 01:03:22.398
LIONS ARE THE KILLER WHALE THE

01:03:22.465 --> 01:03:23.533
THE BIG FISH COMING BACK IN THE

01:03:23.599 --> 01:03:25.168
RIVER ALL WE REALLY WANTED TO BE

01:03:25.234 --> 01:03:26.068
ABLE TO PUT N A FISH IN THE

01:03:26.135 --> 01:03:26.602
RIVER.

01:03:26.669 --> 01:03:27.170
SO -- FISH

01:03:27.236 --> 01:03:28.938
IN THE OCEAN SO THAT WE HAVE A

01:03:29.005 --> 01:03:30.806
RETURNING FISH IN THE RIVER WE

01:03:30.873 --> 01:03:32.575
HAVE A GOOD OCEAN FISHERIES FOR

01:03:32.642 --> 01:03:33.910
BOTH SPORT AND COMMERCIAL.

01:03:33.976 --> 01:03:34.710
SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

01:03:34.777 --> 01:03:37.413
DO IN.

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:38.047
TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE SEASON

01:03:38.114 --> 01:03:38.981
STRUCTURES THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:03:39.048 --> 01:03:40.650
THIS YEAR THE OCEAN ABUNDANCE

01:03:40.716 --> 01:03:42.218
THAT WE'RE HAVING THIS YEAR --

01:03:42.285 --> 01:03:47.223
THE OCEAN ABUNDANCES ISN'T A

01:03:47.290 --> 01:03:48.391
HUNDRED AND IF WE CONTINUE TO

01:03:48.457 --> 01:03:49.959
WORK ON SOME OF THE PROJECTS

01:03:50.026 --> 01:03:50.526
THAT WE'VE DONE THROUGH THE

01:03:50.593 --> 01:03:51.627
DROUGHT --

01:03:51.694 --> 01:03:52.995
WE HOPE TO GET TO THOSE KIND OF

01:03:53.062 --> 01:03:55.198
NUMBERS RATHER THAN WHERE WE ARE

01:03:55.264 --> 01:03:57.533
TODAY --

01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:59.101
THIS YEAR WITH THE AMOUNT OF

01:03:59.168 --> 01:04:00.636
SNOW IN THE MOUNT A RAIN WE'RE

01:04:00.703 --> 01:04:02.305
HOPING FOR GOOD THINGS FOR FOR

01:04:02.371 --> 01:04:03.873
THE YEARS TO COME.

01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:04.407
BUT WE STILL LOOK AT THE

01:04:04.473 --> 01:04:07.176
FISHERIES IS BACK N NINETEEN

01:04:07.243 --> 01:04:09.145
SEVENTY EIGHT WE HAD FOUR

01:04:09.212 --> 01:04:09.745
THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED NINETEEN

01:04:09.812 --> 01:04:10.313
VOTES FIVE HUNDRED AND TWO

01:04:10.379 --> 01:04:13.416
VESSELS CAUGHT 50% OF THE FISH

01:04:13.482 --> 01:04:14.250
TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY FOUR

01:04:14.317 --> 01:04:16.786
VESSELS CUT 90% OF THE FISH.

01:04:16.852 --> 01:04:19.121
IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THERE'S FOUR

01:04:19.188 --> 01:04:20.189
HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX VESSELS

01:04:20.256 --> 01:04:22.725
THAT LANDED A FISH THERE'S FIFTY

01:04:22.792 --> 01:04:24.093
SIX BEZEL THAT LANDED 50%.

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:25.394
THERE'S TWO HUNDRED NINETEEN

01:04:25.461 --> 01:04:26.862
VESSELS THAT LANDED 90% OF THE

01:04:26.929 --> 01:04:27.496
FISH.

01:04:27.563 --> 01:04:30.499
THAT'S A 90% REDUCTION IN THE

01:04:30.566 --> 01:04:32.001
FISHERIES SINCE THEN --

01:04:32.068 --> 01:04:33.836
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH

01:04:33.903 --> 01:04:35.571
SALMON STAMP IS PUT FISH IN THE

01:04:35.638 --> 01:04:36.672
OCEAN SO THAT WE'RE GOING TO

01:04:36.739 --> 01:04:38.441
HAVE AN OCEAN FISHERIES AND AND

01:04:38.507 --> 01:04:39.609
TRY TO DO THAT?

01:04:39.675 --> 01:04:41.544
THIS 90% REDUCTION THE REAL

01:04:41.611 --> 01:04:42.745
PROBLEM THAT WE'RE HAVING WITH

01:04:42.812 --> 01:04:44.513
THAT IS IT'S NOT ONLY THE 90%

01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:46.182
REDUCTION IN THE FISHERIES.

01:04:46.249 --> 01:04:47.950
BUT IT'S A 90% REDUCTION ON THE

01:04:48.017 --> 01:04:51.320
INFRASTRUCTURE ICE MACHINES FEEL

01:04:51.387 --> 01:04:53.222
MECHANICS HERE STORES HOLLOW

01:04:53.289 --> 01:04:55.458
FACILITIES ALL THOSE INDUSTRIES

01:04:55.524 --> 01:04:56.859
HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THE

01:04:56.926 --> 01:04:58.694
REDUCTION IN THE OCEAN FISHERIES.

01:04:58.761 --> 01:05:00.496
AND SO THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED

01:05:00.563 --> 01:05:02.531
REAL PROBLEM WITH US --

01:05:02.598 --> 01:05:03.799
LAST THING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO

01:05:03.866 --> 01:05:04.934
SAY IS IS.

01:05:05.001 --> 01:05:07.169
WE SEE THAT THE REMOVAL OF THE

01:05:07.236 --> 01:05:08.871
DANCE IN TWENTY TWENTY IS COMMON.

01:05:08.938 --> 01:05:10.139
SO WHAT WE'D LIKE TO DO WITH

01:05:10.206 --> 01:05:11.674
SALMON STAMP AT LEAST BE AT THE

01:05:11.741 --> 01:05:13.342
TABLE TO BE ABLE TO TALK WE'D

01:05:13.409 --> 01:05:14.310
LIKE TO SEE SOME OF THE

01:05:14.377 --> 01:05:15.845
SCENARIOS THAT THEY'RE LOOKING

01:05:15.911 --> 01:05:16.746
OUT TO SEA.

01:05:16.812 --> 01:05:19.181
OUR WHAT THE RATINGS OR SNOW

01:05:19.248 --> 01:05:20.983
RATES AND THE FLOW RATES WOULD

01:05:21.050 --> 01:05:22.251
BE AND WHAT KIND OF SEDIMENT

01:05:22.318 --> 01:05:23.486
DEPOSIT THOSE KIND OF THINGS

01:05:23.552 --> 01:05:26.355
WOULD HAPPEN DURING THE SYSTEM --

01:05:26.422 --> 01:05:28.758
WITH THE DM REMOVALS --

01:05:28.824 --> 01:05:32.461
WE WE TO TRY TO HELP MOVE FISHER

01:05:32.528 --> 01:05:34.530
DO SOMETHING IN THE HATCHERIES

01:05:34.597 --> 01:05:35.965
OR WHATEVER --

01:05:36.032 --> 01:05:37.733
TO TO HAVE AN OCEAN FISHERIES

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:40.169
WALL THAT PROJECT IS GOING ON WE

01:05:40.236 --> 01:05:42.038
DON'T WANT TO SEE REMOVAL OF THE

01:05:42.104 --> 01:05:44.240
DAMS AND AND LOSE A COUPLE YEARS

01:05:44.307 --> 01:05:46.542
OF OF STOCKS OUT OF CLAMS SYSTEM

01:05:46.609 --> 01:05:48.077
AND HAVE NO OCEAN FISHERIES SO

01:05:48.144 --> 01:05:48.978
WE WANT TO BE.

INVOLVED IN THAT NOW SO WE CAN

01:05:51.781 --> 01:05:53.816
HAVE SOME KIND OF SCENARIOS AND

01:05:53.883 --> 01:05:54.417
UNDERSTANDINGS OF WHERE THAT

01:05:54.483 --> 01:05:55.318
FISHERIES --

01:05:55.384 --> 01:05:59.755
MIGHT END UP WITH THE REMOVAL OF

01:05:59.822 --> 01:06:00.856
OF THAT.

THEY COULD WEAR TAGS AND

01:07:19.735 --> 01:07:21.237
PROBABLY PRODUCE.

01:07:21.303 --> 01:07:23.873
BETTER RESULTS WITH THE FISH

01:07:23.939 --> 01:07:25.408

THAT PRESENTS THE HEALTH

01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:43.005

01:10:51.113 --> 01:10:52.681
NEED.

SOLUTIONS MAY BECOME.

01:11:06.161 --> 01:11:07.062
OKAY THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE WE'VE

01:11:07.129 --> 01:11:08.464

I KNOW --

01:11:18.874 --> 01:11:21.010
LABELING IS A CONTROVERSIAL

01:11:21.076 --> 01:11:24.780
SUBJECT BUT WHAT'S AT STAKE IS.

WE GET BETTER SEASONS THAN THAN

01:17:41.089 --> 01:17:42.391
WE CAN DEVELOP OTHER THINGS BUT

01:17:42.457 --> 01:17:43.592
THESE ARE THE PROGRAMS THAT

01:17:43.658 --> 01:17:44.359
WE'VE BEEN WORKING THROUGH THE

01:17:44.426 --> 01:17:45.227
DROP IN THERE SHOWING GOOD

01:17:45.293 --> 01:17:47.362
RESULTS AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED

01:17:47.429 --> 01:17:48.497
TO GET BACK TO OUR FOUR MILLION

01:17:48.563 --> 01:17:49.731
ENHANCEMENT FISH SO WE COULD.

01:17:49.798 --> 01:17:51.700
PUT HIM SOMEWHERE WHERE WE THINK

01:17:51.767 --> 01:17:55.837

FOLLOW UP CALL I BASICALLY

01:17:58.507 --> 01:17:59.474
STAYED THE QUESTION BECAUSE THIS

01:17:59.541 --> 01:18:01.043
IS THIS FOR A DIFFICULT POSITION

01:18:01.109 --> 01:18:03.245
AS A AS A LEGISLATOR WHO CARES

01:18:03.311 --> 01:18:04.579
ABOUT ALL THOSE ISSUES.

01:18:04.646 --> 01:18:06.415
AND I I KNOW I WANNA HEALTHY.

01:18:06.481 --> 01:18:08.550
FISHERY AND I ALSO WANT FARMERS

01:18:08.617 --> 01:18:09.184
TO BE ABLE TO PRODUCE FOOD THAT

01:18:09.251 --> 01:18:10.585
I CAN EAT.

01:18:10.652 --> 01:18:12.120
AND I HAVE TO WEIGH THAT BALANCE

01:18:12.187 --> 01:18:13.889
OUT AS A LEGISLATOR IN THOSE ARE

01:18:13.955 --> 01:18:15.257

TO PRODUCE FOOD I CAN EAT AND SO

01:18:25.233 --> 01:18:26.768
THERE'S A THERE'S A BALANCE TRY

01:18:26.835 --> 01:18:27.969
TO STRIKE AND THAT'S WHY THE

01:18:28.036 --> 01:18:28.403
FORCE THAT.

01:18:28.470 --> 01:18:29.571

FIRE SUPPRESSION FOR A HUNDRED

01:18:37.312 --> 01:18:38.013
YEARS.

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:39.514
IT'S NOT RIGHT WASN'T THE

01:18:39.581 --> 01:18:40.982
LIGHTNING WOULD STRIKE IN OUR

01:18:41.049 --> 01:18:42.517
FORCE WOULD BURN.

01:18:42.584 --> 01:18:44.052
EVERY TWELVE YEARS HISTORY WILL

01:18:44.119 --> 01:18:44.953
SHOW US.

01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:47.122

AND NOW WE NEED TO GET BACK IN

01:18:48.156 --> 01:18:49.357

01:20:15.610 --> 01:20:16.845
PLEASE MISS ROBIN.

01:20:16.912 --> 01:20:18.213
ALTON DO YOU BRIEF THIS IS AN

01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:21.082
EXTRAORDINARILY COMPLEX ISSUE

01:20:21.149 --> 01:20:22.517
BUT THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION

01:20:22.584 --> 01:20:23.018
AND THANK YOU FOR BRING

01:20:23.084 --> 01:20:26.087
ATTENTION TO THE TO THIS --

01:20:26.154 --> 01:20:27.489
EMERGING CONCEPT OF OF ONE

01:20:27.556 --> 01:20:29.224
TUNNEL.

01:20:29.291 --> 01:20:30.825
WITH WITHOUT QUESTION AND

01:20:30.892 --> 01:20:32.527
WITHOUT HESITATION.

01:20:32.594 --> 01:20:34.396
IT'S MY BELIEF THAT CARVING UP

01:20:34.462 --> 01:20:35.931
THE DELTA THE THE CONSTRUCTION

01:20:35.997 --> 01:20:37.766
ALONE COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT

01:20:37.832 --> 01:20:40.835
IMPACTS TO THIS CRITICAL AREA

01:20:40.902 --> 01:20:42.804
FOR FOR JUVENILE SALMON --

01:20:42.871 --> 01:20:46.041
IN ADDITION THE LOCATION OF THE

01:20:46.107 --> 01:20:48.243
INTAKES THERE'S A PROBLEM IF

01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:50.312
WE'RE FOR DESIGNING.

01:20:50.378 --> 01:20:52.581
WATER MANAGEMENT SOLUTION. TO BE

01:20:52.647 --> 01:20:54.683
RESILIENT TO SEA LEVEL RISE THE

01:20:54.749 --> 01:20:56.017
CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUES OR SWORD

01:20:56.084 --> 01:20:58.720
IS SEISMICALLY --

01:20:58.787 --> 01:21:00.188
RIZ ROBUST.

01:21:00.255 --> 01:21:02.123
WE DON'T HAVE THAT.

01:21:02.190 --> 01:21:03.491
PROJECT AS IT'S CURRENTLY

01:21:03.558 --> 01:21:05.193
OUTLINED WITH THE W. R. --

01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:06.361
THE INTAKES MAYBE TOO FAR

01:21:06.428 --> 01:21:08.196
DOWNSTREAM TO WITHSTAND LONG

01:21:08.263 --> 01:21:09.898
TERM SEA LEVEL RISE --

01:21:09.965 --> 01:21:11.967
THE SEISMIC QUESTIONS OF THE OF

01:21:12.033 --> 01:21:13.768
THE ENGINEERING CONCEPT ARE ARE

01:21:13.835 --> 01:21:14.803
ARE.

01:21:14.869 --> 01:21:18.406
NOT ANSWERED WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT

01:21:18.473 --> 01:21:21.109
THE THE VOLUME OF WATER.

01:21:21.176 --> 01:21:22.444
THAT MAY BE TRANSMITTED BY THIS

01:21:22.510 --> 01:21:25.247
MONTH THESE TUNNELS WOULD BE --

01:21:25.313 --> 01:21:27.716
AND CERTAINLY IT FROM MY

01:21:27.782 --> 01:21:29.184
PERSPECTIVE --

01:21:29.251 --> 01:21:31.386
THOSE THOSE DESIGN CHALLENGES

01:21:31.453 --> 01:21:34.289
NEED TO TAKE FIRST AND FOREMOST.

01:21:34.356 --> 01:21:37.359
THE OTHER WATER ISSUES THAT

01:21:37.425 --> 01:21:38.460
WE'RE DEALING WITH --

01:21:38.526 --> 01:21:42.030
LIKE PROVIDING MORE NOTCHING AT

01:21:42.097 --> 01:21:43.498
THE A BY PASS --

01:21:43.565 --> 01:21:45.267
MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE

01:21:45.333 --> 01:21:47.102
TO HAVE AS MUCH VOLUME AND THAT

01:21:47.168 --> 01:21:49.237
THE DELTA THE THE WEST COAST'S

01:21:49.304 --> 01:21:50.572
MOST IMPORTANT AND LARGEST

01:21:50.639 --> 01:21:51.773
ESTUARY --

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:53.008
MAXIMIZED SO --

01:21:53.074 --> 01:21:54.576
A LOT OF WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE I

01:21:54.643 --> 01:21:56.911
BELIEVE THAT --

01:21:56.978 --> 01:21:59.848
THE WE NEED TO GO BACK THAT THE

01:21:59.914 --> 01:22:01.283
PROCEEDINGS AT THE WATER BOARD

01:22:01.349 --> 01:22:03.485
NEED TO BE REVAMPED --

01:22:03.551 --> 01:22:05.987
START FROM SCRATCH BECAUSE RIGHT

01:22:06.054 --> 01:22:06.988
NOW.

01:22:07.055 --> 01:22:08.657
NONE OF THE ALTERNATIVES IN ON

01:22:08.723 --> 01:22:10.158
THE PERMITTING --

01:22:10.225 --> 01:22:12.193
DUMPING THE LEGAL SIDE FOR ME

01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:12.861
FOR A SECOND --

01:22:12.927 --> 01:22:16.698
IN MY OPINION ARE ANSWERED SO --

01:22:16.765 --> 01:22:20.268
A LOT MORE WORK. TO BE DONE.

01:22:20.335 --> 01:22:20.835
BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T DISTRICT

01:22:20.902 --> 01:22:21.936
MENACE.

01:22:22.003 --> 01:22:23.305
I CHUCKLE BECAUSE WE HAVE

01:22:23.371 --> 01:22:24.539
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT VIEWS ON THIS

01:22:24.606 --> 01:22:27.876
AND IT'S RARE --

01:22:27.942 --> 01:22:30.245
G. GSA'S OFFICIAL VIEW IS THAT

01:22:30.312 --> 01:22:31.112
THE STATE WATER RESOURCES

01:22:31.179 --> 01:22:33.081
CONTROL BOARD NEEDS TO COMPLETE

01:22:33.148 --> 01:22:36.051
ITS PHASE TWO OF THE DELTA WATER

01:22:36.117 --> 01:22:38.053
QUALITY UPDATE PLAN FIRST THAT

01:22:38.119 --> 01:22:39.754
WILL TELL US HOW MUCH WATER.

01:22:39.821 --> 01:22:40.922
IS POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE FOR

01:22:40.989 --> 01:22:42.824
EXPORT THROUGH THE DELTA AND IT

01:22:42.891 --> 01:22:44.826
SEEMS THAT IS NOT RESPONSIBLE TO

01:22:44.893 --> 01:22:46.361
DESIGN A PROJECT TO WE KNOW HOW

01:22:46.428 --> 01:22:47.662
MUCH WATER WE ACTUALLY REALLY

01:22:47.729 --> 01:22:48.797
HAVE TO WORK WITH.

01:22:48.863 --> 01:22:50.832
THAT'S NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO TO

01:22:50.899 --> 01:22:52.267
QUOTE STAFFORD LAYER OF THE

01:22:52.334 --> 01:22:53.768
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH

01:22:53.835 --> 01:22:54.936
AND WILDLIFE --

01:22:55.003 --> 01:22:56.204
THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME WATER

01:22:56.271 --> 01:22:58.573
MOVED FROM NORTHERN ALIFORNIA

01:22:58.640 --> 01:22:59.974
TO THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY INTO

01:23:00.041 --> 01:23:01.543
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE ACCEPT

01:23:01.609 --> 01:23:03.678
THAT AS AN ARTICLE OF FAITH.

01:23:03.745 --> 01:23:05.547
THE EXISTING SYSTEM.

01:23:05.613 --> 01:23:06.381
THAT.

01:23:06.448 --> 01:23:08.049
MOVES THIS WATER AROUND THE

01:23:08.116 --> 01:23:09.651
DELTA KILL SALMON RIGHT NOW.

01:23:09.718 --> 01:23:11.619
IT KILLS SALMON COULD WE DEVELOP

01:23:11.686 --> 01:23:13.021
A BETTER SYSTEM THAT COULD STILL

01:23:13.088 --> 01:23:15.190
MOVE SOME WATER AND BE BORE MORE

01:23:15.256 --> 01:23:16.424
BENIGN TO THE WILDLIFE.

01:23:16.491 --> 01:23:18.259
THEORETICALLY WE COULD --

01:23:18.326 --> 01:23:20.195
HAVE WE SEEN IT YET NOT AS FAR

01:23:20.261 --> 01:23:21.529
AS WE KNOW AND THIS GOES TO

01:23:21.596 --> 01:23:22.630
NOTICE POINT ABOUT.

01:23:22.697 --> 01:23:24.132
A NEAT NEED TO TAKE A WHOLE NEW

01:23:24.199 --> 01:23:26.368
LOOK AT IT I WOULD ALSO COMMENT.

01:23:26.434 --> 01:23:27.869
ON THE LAST GO AROUND WITH THE

01:23:27.936 --> 01:23:29.070
TWIN TUNNELS.

01:23:29.137 --> 01:23:30.739
I THINK IT WAS G. C. ID WHO

01:23:30.805 --> 01:23:32.207
RESPONDED TO THE DRAFT

01:23:32.273 --> 01:23:33.842
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT AND

01:23:33.908 --> 01:23:35.009
THEY HAD SOME REALLY GOOD

01:23:35.076 --> 01:23:36.111
COMMENTS ABOUT --

01:23:36.177 --> 01:23:38.213
THE INTAKE SCREENS NEAR FREEPORT

01:23:38.279 --> 01:23:39.981
IN SACRAMENTO HERE AND THEY

01:23:40.048 --> 01:23:41.783
POINTED OUT THE BASICALLY IF

01:23:41.850 --> 01:23:43.284
YOU'RE GOING TO PUT IN TAKES IN

01:23:43.351 --> 01:23:45.186
A RIVER YOU NEED TO PUT IT IN A

01:23:45.253 --> 01:23:47.255
CURVE IN THE BAND BECAUSE IT

01:23:47.322 --> 01:23:48.690
FORCES THE WATER SPEED UP.

01:23:48.757 --> 01:23:50.925
AND SKEW YOUR BABY SALMON PAST

01:23:50.992 --> 01:23:54.295
THE END YOU PUT THE INTAKES IN A

01:23:54.362 --> 01:23:55.897
STRAIGHT AWAY YOU'RE GONNA KILL

01:23:55.964 --> 01:23:57.766
MORE SALMON RIGHT NOW THEY'RE IN

01:23:57.832 --> 01:23:58.800
STRAIGHT AWAY.

01:23:58.867 --> 01:23:59.934
SO THERE'S ALL KINDS OF

01:24:00.001 --> 01:24:01.302
CONSIDERATIONS BUT FIRST AND

01:24:01.369 --> 01:24:02.937
FOREMOST THE STATE WATER BOARD

01:24:03.004 --> 01:24:04.672
NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO COMPLETE.

01:24:04.739 --> 01:24:06.574
ITS PROJECT.

01:24:06.641 --> 01:24:08.877
TO REBALANCE WATER ALLOCATION SO

01:24:08.943 --> 01:24:10.512
THE DELTA IS NOT DYING.

01:24:10.578 --> 01:24:11.780
HE WAS RE MENACE RICKETS MISTER

01:24:11.846 --> 01:24:13.715
ANDERSON.

01:24:13.782 --> 01:24:17.051
IN THE END WE WE I WAS GONNA BE

01:24:17.118 --> 01:24:18.753
A MINUTE AT THE FLOWS.

01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:20.054
MANAGEMENT OF THE PHONE MORE

01:24:20.121 --> 01:24:20.655
THAN.

01:24:20.722 --> 01:24:23.425
OUR WEATHER'S ONE OR TWO BECAUSE

01:24:23.491 --> 01:24:26.194
ONE CAN BE JUST AS BAD AS TO BUT

01:24:26.261 --> 01:24:27.662
I THINK THERE'S A THERE'S A

01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:28.963
BALANCE THERE THAT WE CAN ALL

01:24:29.030 --> 01:24:30.865
WORK WITH.

01:24:30.932 --> 01:24:32.133
BUT LIKE HE SAYS WHERE'S

01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:35.069
POSITIONS HOW IT IS AND IT'S

01:24:35.136 --> 01:24:36.371
JUST LIKE THE PUMPS AREN'T BAD.

01:24:36.438 --> 01:24:37.305
EXCEPT WHEN THEY WERE PUMPING

01:24:37.372 --> 01:24:39.507
MORE BABY FIRST ROOM THEN THERE

01:24:39.574 --> 01:24:40.875
WAS WATER PRACTICALLY YOU KOW.

01:24:40.942 --> 01:24:42.677
THERE'S THE MANAGEMENT OF IT IS

01:24:42.744 --> 01:24:44.946
IF WE CAN HAVE OVERSIGHT OVER

01:24:45.013 --> 01:24:46.281
THERE IS OVERSIGHT.

01:24:46.347 --> 01:24:48.249
THAT CAN IN THE CONSTRUCTION AND

01:24:48.316 --> 01:24:50.752
THE DESIGN.

01:24:50.819 --> 01:24:52.253
THAT WOULD KEEP THE FISH FROM

01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:53.822
THE IT WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH A

01:24:53.888 --> 01:24:54.989
DIVERSION LIKE THAT.

01:24:55.056 --> 01:24:56.991
WILL CHANGE THE WHOLE MIGRATORY

01:24:57.058 --> 01:24:59.060
FLOWS. FOR THE SYSTEM BE

01:24:59.127 --> 01:25:00.628
DIVERTED SOMEPLACE [inaudible]

01:25:00.695 --> 01:25:02.964
WERE RESTRICTED.

01:25:03.031 --> 01:25:04.899
WITH THE HATCHERY FISH ON ON

01:25:04.966 --> 01:25:06.901
STRAYING IN WITH SOMETHING LIKE

01:25:06.968 --> 01:25:08.970
THIS BECAUSE MAJOR STRAYING

01:25:09.037 --> 01:25:11.906
INDUSTRY AND THE FIRST RETURNING.

01:25:11.973 --> 01:25:14.976
TO THEIR STREAMS THESE ARE

01:25:15.043 --> 01:25:15.577
THINGS THAT YOU KNOW IT'S NOT

01:25:15.643 --> 01:25:16.311
LIKE.

01:25:16.377 --> 01:25:17.545
WE DON'T WANT TO SHARE THE WATER

01:25:17.612 --> 01:25:19.047
IS THIS HOPEFULLY THAT WE CAN

01:25:19.113 --> 01:25:21.783
ALL WORK WITH IT.

01:25:21.850 --> 01:25:22.283
NOTHING SUBMISSIONS FOR

01:25:22.350 --> 01:25:23.318
CONSTRUCTION.

01:25:23.384 --> 01:25:24.986
I'M WORKING WITH A GROUP OF

01:25:25.053 --> 01:25:26.187
PEOPLE THAT.

01:25:26.254 --> 01:25:28.923
BELIEVE THAT OUR GOAL IS.

01:25:28.990 --> 01:25:29.457
TO PETITIONER'S SHOULDN'T

01:25:29.524 --> 01:25:32.727
RESTORE THE FISHERY FISHERIES

AND STAY OUT OF THE WATER WARS.

01:25:36.731 --> 01:25:38.500
AND SO WE TRY TO WORK ON WHAT WE

01:25:38.566 --> 01:25:40.902
COULD DO TO INFLUENCE THAT AND

01:25:40.969 --> 01:25:42.237
LIKE I SAY ARE.

01:25:42.303 --> 01:25:43.872
MOST COMMON GOAL NOW IS TO GET

01:25:43.938 --> 01:25:44.772
BACK TO THE FOUR MILLION

01:25:44.839 --> 01:25:46.040
ENHANCEMENT FISH SO WE CAN PUT

01:25:46.107 --> 01:25:47.242
HIM IN THE OCEAN [inaudible]

01:25:47.308 --> 01:25:48.943
IT CONCERNS.

FABRICATED CRISIS.

01:28:59.834 --> 01:29:01.102
IT'S VERY EASY TO MAKE

01:29:09.977 --> 01:29:12.814
TRULY TRULY DISGUSTED COMMERCIAL

01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:14.315
FISHERMEN ARE BEING ASKED TO CUT

01:29:14.382 --> 01:29:15.817
OFF EITHER THEIR RIGHT HAND OR

01:29:15.883 --> 01:29:17.585
THE LEFT HAND AND THAT IS NOT

01:29:17.652 --> 01:29:19.821
ACCEPTABLE IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR

01:29:19.887 --> 01:29:22.790
FORM [inaudible]

01:29:22.857 --> 01:29:23.991
CLOSURES.

01:29:24.058 --> 01:29:25.793
WILL BANKRUPT SOME OF OUR

01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:27.829
YOUNGER FISHERMEN WHO HAVE NO

01:29:27.895 --> 01:29:28.629
WHETHER FISHERIES TO BACK THEM

01:29:28.696 --> 01:29:29.330
UP.

01:29:29.397 --> 01:29:31.299
LOSING PARTS OF OUR SEASON WILL

01:29:31.365 --> 01:29:33.234
HURT NEEDLESSLY AND CONSIDERING

01:29:33.301 --> 01:29:34.469
THE FACT THAT FISHERMEN HAVE

01:29:34.535 --> 01:29:36.003
BENT OVER.

01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:36.804
BACKWARDS FOR THE LAST FOUR

01:29:36.871 --> 01:29:39.841
YEARS DID YOU EVER AVOID WHALEN

01:29:39.907 --> 01:29:41.008
TANGLING.

01:29:41.075 --> 01:29:43.945
THIS AGAIN IS JUST ON ACCEPTABLE.

01:29:44.011 --> 01:29:46.881
WE'VE DONE IT TIME AND TIME

01:29:46.948 --> 01:29:48.549
AGAIN GOOD FAITH.

01:29:48.616 --> 01:29:51.652
THE FACT IS THAT IN TWO THOUSAND

01:29:51.719 --> 01:29:52.520
NINETEEN THERE HAVE BEEN NO

01:29:52.587 --> 01:29:56.491
ENTANGLEMENTS IN THREE STATES.

01:29:56.557 --> 01:29:58.426
ZERO THE FACT IS SHIP STRIKES DO

01:29:58.493 --> 01:30:02.096
MORE DAMAGE. TO THE WELL

01:30:02.163 --> 01:30:04.098
POPULATIONS NO ONE SEEMS TO CARE

01:30:04.165 --> 01:30:05.566
ABOUT THAT WHY SHOULD THEY WIN

01:30:05.633 --> 01:30:06.968
THE FISHMAN CAN BE MADE OUT TO

01:30:07.034 --> 01:30:08.336
BE THE BAD GUYS LET'S JUST

01:30:08.402 --> 01:30:09.203
REMOVE THE FISHERMEN

01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:09.504
[inaudible]

01:30:09.570 --> 01:30:12.740
QUESTION. FOR EVERYBODY IS WHY

01:30:12.807 --> 01:30:14.408
IS THE COMMERCIAL FLEET TAKING

01:30:14.475 --> 01:30:15.743
THE BRUNT OF THIS.

01:30:15.810 --> 01:30:17.545
PROPOSED CLOSURE WHILE

01:30:17.612 --> 01:30:19.347
RECREATIONAL FISHERMEN ARE

01:30:19.413 --> 01:30:20.948
ALLOWED TO CONTINUE FISHING DO

01:30:21.015 --> 01:30:22.316
WELLS KNOW THE DIFFERENCE

01:30:22.383 --> 01:30:24.018
BETWEEN A WRECK LINE AND A

01:30:24.085 --> 01:30:25.520
COMMERCIAL LINE.

01:30:25.586 --> 01:30:30.158
FACT THE WELL POPULATION IS-GROWING BY 8% A YEAR.

01:30:30.224 --> 01:30:31.726
I ASKED YOU WHAT IS WRONG WITH

01:30:31.793 --> 01:30:33.995
THIS PICTURE.

01:30:34.061 --> 01:30:35.296
ANOTHER FACT.

01:30:35.363 --> 01:30:37.431
THE CRAB FISHERY USED.

01:30:37.498 --> 01:30:38.299
IN THIS STATE IS ONE OF THE

01:30:38.366 --> 01:30:39.734
STATE'S OLDEST COMMERCIAL

01:30:39.801 --> 01:30:41.803
FISHERIES IT'S BEEN HELD TO HIGH

01:30:41.869 --> 01:30:43.204
STANDARDS AND REMAINED STRONG.

01:30:43.271 --> 01:30:45.873
DUE TO MANY INDUSTRY INNOVATIONS

01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:46.941
OVER THE YEARS SUCH AS X. SCAPE

01:30:47.008 --> 01:30:49.210
RINGS AND COTTONS WE PUT THESE

01:30:49.277 --> 01:30:51.078
DAYS THESE THINGS IN NOT THE

01:30:51.145 --> 01:30:53.948
STATE WE DID IT FOR OURSELVES TO

01:30:54.015 --> 01:30:54.515
KEEP OUR FISHERY [inaudible]

01:30:54.582 --> 01:30:56.551
SOLID.

01:30:56.617 --> 01:30:57.985
THIS CONTINUES TODAY WITH THE

01:30:58.052 --> 01:30:59.587
INNOVATIONS THAT FISHMAN SUCH AS

01:30:59.654 --> 01:31:00.855
DECALOGUE HAVE WORKED TIRELESSLY

01:31:00.922 --> 01:31:03.558
ON FACT.

01:31:03.624 --> 01:31:05.293
WE NEED THE CROSS TO OTHER CRAP

01:31:05.359 --> 01:31:07.895
TASK FORCE RE UPPED NOW NOT IN

01:31:07.962 --> 01:31:11.098
THE FALL.

01:31:11.165 --> 01:31:12.800
WE COULD SEE ADDED PRESSURE ON

01:31:12.867 --> 01:31:15.303
THE SALMON SEASON OVER THE YEARS

01:31:15.369 --> 01:31:16.571
THE MANAGEMENT STYLE.

01:31:16.637 --> 01:31:18.406
HAS GOING TO CLOSING FISHERIES

01:31:18.472 --> 01:31:20.274
RIGHT LEFT AND FORCING IS INTO

01:31:20.341 --> 01:31:21.976
THE SAME POT ALL.

01:31:22.043 --> 01:31:23.945
GUNS ANY LATERAL FISHING THAT'S

01:31:24.011 --> 01:31:25.479
NOT MANAGEMENT.

01:31:25.546 --> 01:31:26.781
BEING FORCED TO BRING YOUR CRAB

01:31:26.848 --> 01:31:29.684

01:31:31.352 --> 01:31:32.520
BRING IT IN.

01:31:32.587 --> 01:31:34.288
WILL ADD AN EXTRA DANGER THIS

01:31:34.355 --> 01:31:35.323
YEAR --

01:31:35.389 --> 01:31:36.891

BOATS [inaudible]

01:31:57.311 --> 01:32:01.716
AND IF ONE OF THEM DIES IT IS ON

01:32:01.782 --> 01:32:04.285
THE STATE'S HEAD.

01:32:04.352 --> 01:32:05.419

THAT THE GEAR INNOVATORS HAVE

01:33:18.859 --> 01:33:20.861
TURNED OF MEN TO ITEMS THAT

01:33:20.928 --> 01:33:22.430
DON'T NECESSARILY IMPEDE OUR

01:33:22.496 --> 01:33:27.001
ABILITY. TO TO FISH AND REDUCE

01:33:27.068 --> 01:33:28.069
THE IMPACT IT.

01:33:28.135 --> 01:33:29.737
THEY'RE THEY'RE REDUCING THE

01:33:29.804 --> 01:33:32.440
IMPACT ON THE ENTANGLED ANIMALS.

01:33:32.506 --> 01:33:35.009
SO THE IDEA IS TO REMOVE THE

01:33:35.076 --> 01:33:35.977
WEIGHT OF THE CRAB TRAP.

01:33:36.043 --> 01:33:38.245
QUICKLY.

01:33:38.312 --> 01:33:40.081
AND KEEP THE LINES FROM HITCHING

01:33:40.147 --> 01:33:44.352
ON THE THE THE ANIMAL ITSELF.

01:33:44.418 --> 01:33:46.320
THE DEVICE IS A SEPARATE THE

01:33:46.387 --> 01:33:48.422
LINES IN THERE BASICALLY COLD

01:33:48.489 --> 01:33:50.658
LINE CODERS --

01:33:50.725 --> 01:33:52.860
THIS PARTICULAR PRODUCT CAN BE

01:33:52.927 --> 01:33:55.930
OF SET OF RETENTION DEPP'S

01:33:55.997 --> 01:33:59.000
SPEEDS AND A TIME TIME

01:33:59.066 --> 01:34:01.302
SPECIFICALLY IS REALLY IMPORTANT

01:34:01.369 --> 01:34:02.103
THE LONGER.

01:34:02.169 --> 01:34:04.972
NEAR ME IF IT TAKES JUST A FEW

01:34:05.039 --> 01:34:06.273
SECONDS TO BRING UP THE GEAR.

01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:08.142
IF THE PART IS PULLED FOR A LONG

01:34:08.209 --> 01:34:09.610
DRUG FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME

01:34:09.677 --> 01:34:12.046
LINE COULD POTENTIALLY CUT THE

01:34:12.113 --> 01:34:13.247
CUT THE ROPE.

01:34:13.314 --> 01:34:14.715
AND ALLOW THE POT TO FALL OFF

01:34:14.782 --> 01:34:17.118
AND MINIMIZE THE THE IMPACT TO

01:34:17.184 --> 01:34:18.452
THE ANIMAL.

01:34:18.519 --> 01:34:21.288
MY HOPE IS THAT WE CAN PUT THIS --

01:34:21.355 --> 01:34:23.491
TRY THESE LINE CODERS IN THE

01:34:23.557 --> 01:34:26.027
FIRST TEN FATHOMS OF THE OF THE

01:34:26.093 --> 01:34:28.262
GEARED TO BE ABLE TO GROUP

01:34:28.329 --> 01:34:29.897
THAT'S LEFT.

01:34:29.964 --> 01:34:32.533
AND POSSIBLY ALLOW THE ANIMAL TO

01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:35.536
FREE FREE ITSELF AND POTENTIALLY.

01:34:35.603 --> 01:34:37.038
YOU KNOW INCREASE THE

01:34:37.104 --> 01:34:38.439
OPPORTUNITY.

01:34:38.506 --> 01:34:40.808
FOR US TO BE ABLE TO DISENTANGLE

01:34:40.875 --> 01:34:42.209
THE ANIMAL QUICKER.

01:34:42.276 --> 01:34:44.178
OR EASIER EASIER THE OTHER THING

01:34:44.245 --> 01:34:47.148
WE'RE WORKING ON IS --

01:34:47.214 --> 01:34:49.216
GPS BOOTIES --

01:34:49.283 --> 01:34:52.486
AND WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO BE

01:34:52.553 --> 01:34:53.888
TESTING THOSE AGAIN HERE VERY

01:34:53.954 --> 01:34:57.024
SHORTLY -- I

01:34:57.091 --> 01:34:58.526
REALLY TRULY BELIEVE THAT THIS

01:34:58.592 --> 01:35:00.261
WILL REDUCE THE NUMBER OF LOST

01:35:00.327 --> 01:35:01.328
POTS AND HELP US TRACK THE

01:35:01.395 --> 01:35:04.498
ANIMALS IF THEY DO GET ENTANGLED

01:35:04.565 --> 01:35:04.799
[inaudible]

01:35:04.865 --> 01:35:08.502
YOU'RE GONNA.

01:35:08.569 --> 01:35:09.136
BUT THE LINE CUTTER CENTIMETER

01:35:09.203 --> 01:35:10.438
UP THIS WILL TAKE YOUR TIME SO

01:35:10.504 --> 01:35:13.607
JUST EXPLAIN HOW THE BECAUSE

01:35:13.674 --> 01:35:14.141
YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO BE --

01:35:14.208 --> 01:35:14.775
TO SEE.

01:35:14.842 --> 01:35:16.377
THE WAILING TANGLES EXACTLY AS I

01:35:16.444 --> 01:35:17.545
JUST WALK US THROUGH THAT REAL

01:35:17.611 --> 01:35:18.712
QUICK OKAY --

01:35:18.779 --> 01:35:20.648
YOU KNOW MY MY MY THOUGHT WAS

01:35:20.714 --> 01:35:22.116
THAT YOU KNOW I MEAN WE CAN'T

01:35:22.183 --> 01:35:24.018
REALLY LOSE THE GEAR WE DON'T

01:35:24.085 --> 01:35:25.119
WANT TO BE YOU KNOW HAVING THE

01:35:25.186 --> 01:35:26.454
LINE CUT.

AND POTENTIALLY DIRECTLY BEHIND

01:35:33.961 --> 01:35:36.397

LONG YOU KNOW GIVE GIVE IT TIME.

01:35:38.299 --> 01:35:39.700
TO PULL ON THE LINE AND

01:35:39.767 --> 01:35:41.735
POTENTIALLY COATED IN RELEASE

01:35:41.802 --> 01:35:43.704
YOU KNOW A OB CHIC.

01:35:43.771 --> 01:35:48.142
ON LAND SO WE KNOW KIND OF WHAT.

THE ANIMAL QUICKLY OR GET THE

01:36:04.425 --> 01:36:06.393
WEIGHT OFF THOUGH AND THE LINE

01:36:06.460 --> 01:36:08.162
QUICKLY.

01:36:08.229 --> 01:36:10.131
THAT THE DAMAGE IS LESS NO I I I

01:36:10.197 --> 01:36:12.700
REALLY HOPE THAT THAT'S STILL

01:36:12.766 --> 01:36:13.234
THE WAY IT'S GOING TO WORK

SENSORS ON THE LINE SO THAT WE

01:36:23.344 --> 01:36:25.479
CAN KND OF GET AN IDEA.

01:36:25.546 --> 01:36:26.547
HOW THESE LINES?

01:36:26.614 --> 01:36:27.581
LATE IN THE WATER UNDER

01:36:27.648 --> 01:36:28.649

TYPICALLY THAT ENDS UP BEING A

01:36:33.053 --> 01:36:35.089
TWO DIMENSIONAL.

01:36:35.156 --> 01:36:37.925
OF GRAFT YOU CAN SEE OPEN DOWN

01:36:37.992 --> 01:36:38.626
BUT YOU CAN'T SEE FORWARD AND

01:36:38.692 --> 01:36:40.794
BACKWARDS AND YOU ALSO CAN'T SEE

01:36:40.861 --> 01:36:42.129
IF IT MAKES A LOOP.

FISHERMEN ARE IN SPACE AND TIME

01:49:29.062 --> 01:49:30.563
IS SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T HAVE

01:49:30.630 --> 01:49:31.665
READILY AVAILABLE AND

01:49:31.731 --> 01:49:32.198
QUANTITATIVELY GIVE SOME

01:49:32.265 --> 01:49:34.901

SEEN IN DISCOVERED OUT IN THE

01:49:38.772 --> 01:49:42.108
WATER SO AN EXAMPLE THAT COMES

01:49:42.175 --> 01:49:44.811
UP IS WHEN AND THIS WAS LAST

01:49:44.878 --> 01:49:45.512
DECEMBER SO.

01:49:45.578 --> 01:49:48.481
DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND AND

01:49:48.548 --> 01:49:49.983
SEVENTEEN THERE WAS OUT REPORTS

01:49:50.050 --> 01:49:50.951
THAT WERE COMING IN FROM

01:49:51.017 --> 01:49:52.519
FISHERMEN THAT WERE TALKING

01:49:52.585 --> 01:49:56.156
ABOUT CLEAR WATERS NO WHEELS

01:49:56.222 --> 01:49:57.457
WHAT'S A GOOD FISHING.

01:49:57.524 --> 01:49:58.892
A BIT YOU'RE CERTAINLY THE START

OF THE SEASON LOTS OF LOTS OF

01:50:00.627 --> 01:50:01.995
GEAR OUT AND WE WERE GETTING

01:50:02.062 --> 01:50:04.164
INPUT IN FROM WHALE WATCHING

01:50:04.230 --> 01:50:05.332
OPERATIONS.

01:50:05.398 --> 01:50:06.533
THAT THERE WERE HUGE

01:50:06.599 --> 01:50:07.968
CONCENTRATIONS OF WALES.

01:50:08.034 --> 01:50:09.069
AND WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE A

01:50:09.135 --> 01:50:10.804
DIRECT LINE OF COMMUNICATION

01:50:10.870 --> 01:50:12.105
WITH THE FISHERMEN TO ASK WHAT

01:50:12.172 --> 01:50:13.473
THEY WERE SEEING AND THERE WAS A

01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:15.241
DISCONNECT AS TO WHAT WAS BEING

01:50:15.308 --> 01:50:16.309
OBSERVED ON THE WATER.

01:50:16.376 --> 01:50:18.345
THAT THEN LED TO THE ABILITY TO

01:50:18.411 --> 01:50:19.779
DO AN AERIAL SURVEY WHICH IS

01:50:19.846 --> 01:50:21.414
WEATHER DEPENDENT SO NOT ALWAYS

01:50:21.481 --> 01:50:23.316
RELIABLE BUT RELIABLE TOOL THAT

01:50:23.383 --> 01:50:24.250
WAS AVAILABLE.

01:50:24.317 --> 01:50:25.719
AND THE AERIAL SURVEY WAS ABLE

01:50:25.785 --> 01:50:27.287
TO SHOW THAT THERE WERE A GREAT

01:50:27.354 --> 01:50:29.723
NUMBER OF WHALES AND THERE WAS A

01:50:29.789 --> 01:50:30.824
HUGE AMOUNT OF FISHING HAPPENING

01:50:30.890 --> 01:50:31.925
BECAUSE IT WAS DECEMBER.

01:50:31.992 --> 01:50:34.027
BUT THERE WASN'T VERY LITTLE

01:50:34.094 --> 01:50:35.762
OVERLAP BETWEEN THE TWO AND IT

01:50:35.829 --> 01:50:37.464
WAS BEING ABLE TO HAVE THAT

01:50:37.530 --> 01:50:38.264
DIRECT LINE OF CONVERSATION WITH

01:50:38.331 --> 01:50:39.599
THE FISHERMEN TO LET US KNOW

01:50:39.666 --> 01:50:41.401
THAT IF WE HAD JUST RECEIVED THE

01:50:41.468 --> 01:50:42.502
INFORMATION FROM THE WHALE

01:50:42.569 --> 01:50:44.037
OPERATORS WHICH AGAIN WERE

01:50:44.104 --> 01:50:44.938

OBSERVING ON THE WATER.

01:50:46.373 --> 01:50:48.274
THAT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN MORE OF

01:50:48.341 --> 01:50:49.809
I NEED TO HAVE TO ACT IN TERMS

01:50:49.876 --> 01:50:52.012
OF MANAGEMENT MEASURES QUICKER --

01:50:52.078 --> 01:50:53.313
THIS ALLOWED THERE TO BE MORE OF

01:50:53.380 --> 01:50:54.814
A BALANCED CONVERSATION AROUND

01:50:54.881 --> 01:50:55.915
IT AND THEN THE AERIAL SURVEY

01:50:55.982 --> 01:50:57.384
BEING THE OBJECTIVE DATA TO HELP

01:50:57.450 --> 01:50:58.551

02:05:32.691 --> 02:05:33.859
SO THAT WE WILL USE IT WE WON'T

02:05:33.926 --> 02:05:35.327
HAVE TO FIGHT YOU WON'T HAVE TO

02:05:35.394 --> 02:05:36.629
BEG.

02:05:36.695 --> 02:05:38.063
FOR INVESTMENT IN THOSE KINDS OF

02:05:38.130 --> 02:05:39.398
RELEASES THAT'S GOING TO PUT

02:05:39.465 --> 02:05:40.766
FISH ON THE BACK DECK --

02:05:40.833 --> 02:05:42.268
IT'S GONNA BRING MORE FISH BACK

02:05:42.334 --> 02:05:45.037
TO THE RIVER WE'RE GOING TO BE

02:05:45.104 --> 02:05:46.872
WORKING ON SOME KEY WATER

02:05:46.939 --> 02:05:48.173
QUALITY PROVISIONS THAT HAS TO

02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:49.575
DO WITH TIMBER HARVEST --

02:05:49.642 --> 02:05:51.010
AS YOUR COLLEAGUE MISTER DALI

02:05:51.076 --> 02:05:52.845
ALREADY SPOKE --

02:05:52.912 --> 02:05:54.346
TO THE CAL FIRE.

02:05:54.413 --> 02:05:56.982
IS IT REALLY IMPORTANT AGENCY

FOR THE PURPOSES OF MANAGING OUR

02:05:58.751 --> 02:05:59.585
WATERWAYS.

02:05:59.652 --> 02:06:02.187
AND THEY HAVE ONE MAJOR -

02:06:02.254 --> 02:06:04.456
THE RESPONSIBILITY WHICH IS TO

02:06:04.523 --> 02:06:07.326
TRANSMIT TIMBER HARVEST PLANS TO

02:06:07.393 --> 02:06:08.427
REGIONAL WATER QUALITY CONTROL

02:06:08.494 --> 02:06:10.562
PLAN BOARDS FOR REVIEW BUT THOSE

02:06:10.629 --> 02:06:11.830
REGIONAL BOARDS ARE ARE DEEPLY

02:06:11.897 --> 02:06:13.399
UNDERSTAFFED AS YOU KNOW --

02:06:13.465 --> 02:06:15.034
AND OFTEN THOSE REVIEWS DON'T

02:06:15.100 --> 02:06:15.868
OCCUR.

02:06:15.935 --> 02:06:17.636

WITH RESPECT TO SENATE POLLUTION

02:06:21.273 --> 02:06:24.009
CAN MAKE IT THROUGH --

02:06:24.076 --> 02:06:26.979
THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THAT

02:06:27.046 --> 02:06:27.980
REVIEW TO OCCUR AND IT WOULD

02:06:28.047 --> 02:06:30.115
REQUIRE REGION BOARD TO

02:06:30.182 --> 02:06:32.084
RECOMMEND HOW A TIMBER HARVEST

02:06:32.151 --> 02:06:33.085
PLAN THAT WOULD.

02:06:33.152 --> 02:06:34.753
BE OUT OF COMPLIANCE CAN GET

02:06:34.820 --> 02:06:36.155
BACK INTO COMPLIANCE SO THAT WE

TIMBER HARVEST --

02:06:38.757 --> 02:06:41.193

THEY PROCESS.

02:08:02.474 --> 02:08:04.243
ROUND FISH INTO PRODUCT FORMS

02:08:04.309 --> 02:08:06.945
THAT ARE LITTLE MORE ADAPTABLE

WHAT IS AWFUL CULTURE WHAT IS

02:08:37.076 --> 02:08:39.344
AQUAPONICS WHAT IS AQUA FINA

02:08:39.411 --> 02:08:40.079
WHAT IS?

02:08:40.145 --> 02:08:42.614
IT THE FISH FARMERS THEY FARM

02:08:42.681 --> 02:08:44.116
FISH.

02:08:44.183 --> 02:08:45.784
THEY FARMED OYSTERS ONE DAY WE

MAY FARM --

02:08:47.753 --> 02:08:48.253
OCEAN --

02:08:48.320 --> 02:08:53.792
FINFISH --

02:08:53.859 --> 02:08:55.561
CALIFORNIA FISH FARMERS DO SOME

02:08:55.627 --> 02:08:57.162
OTHER THINGS SO THEY STOCK A

02:08:57.229 --> 02:08:58.697
100% F THE WARM WATER FISH.

02:08:58.764 --> 02:08:59.665
STOCKS IN THE STATE OF

02:08:59.731 --> 02:09:02.301
CALIFORNIA BASS BLUEGILL CATFISH

02:09:02.367 --> 02:09:03.335
AND ABOUT HALF OF ALL THE TROUT

02:09:03.402 --> 02:09:04.403
THAT STOCK.

02:09:04.470 --> 02:09:06.071
THAT LEADS TO LICENSE SALES AT

02:09:06.138 --> 02:09:07.739
LEAST A FUN FOR FAMILIES AND

02:09:12.010 --> 02:09:13.946
RESTRICTIONS AND IT'S A LOT OF

02:09:14.012 --> 02:09:14.713
FUN.

02:09:14.780 --> 02:09:17.049
THEY ALSO PRODUCE A VARIETY OF

02:09:17.116 --> 02:09:18.884
FISH AND SHELLFISH INCLUDING

02:09:18.951 --> 02:09:20.285
ALGAE AN ABALONE.

02:09:20.352 --> 02:09:22.955
BASS BLUEGILL CARP CATFISH

02:09:23.021 --> 02:09:25.257
CAVIAR MUSSELS OYSTERS

02:09:25.324 --> 02:09:25.557
[inaudible]

02:09:25.624 --> 02:09:27.059
PERCH.

02:09:27.126 --> 02:09:29.661
SEE WE'D STURGEON TILAPIA TROUT

02:09:29.728 --> 02:09:31.830
AND MORE --

02:09:31.897 --> 02:09:34.433
THEY ARE ACTIVE AQUACULTURE FISH

02:09:34.500 --> 02:09:36.235
FARMING IS ACTIVE IN EVERY

02:09:36.301 --> 02:09:38.937
COUNTY IN THE STATE --

02:09:39.004 --> 02:09:40.572
IT'S GOING TO BE PART OF THE

02:09:40.639 --> 02:09:42.407
SOLUTION FOR FUTURE SEAFOOD

02:09:42.474 --> 02:09:43.408
DEMAND.

02:09:43.475 --> 02:09:44.810
I THINK OUR FISHERIES AND IN

02:09:44.877 --> 02:09:47.246
MANY CASES.

02:09:47.312 --> 02:09:48.814
OUR FULLY --

02:09:48.881 --> 02:09:50.582
DEVELOPED.

02:09:50.649 --> 02:09:52.818
WE KNOW WE HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO

02:09:52.885 --> 02:09:55.053
INCREASE OUR TAKE A FISH HERE IN

02:09:55.120 --> 02:09:56.855
CALIFORNIA DUE TO OUR EXPERT.

02:09:56.922 --> 02:09:59.525
AND IN OUTSTANDING FISHERY

02:09:59.591 --> 02:10:00.926
MANAGEMENT --

02:10:00.993 --> 02:10:03.128
BUT OVERALL ON OUR PLANET WE

02:10:03.195 --> 02:10:05.430
NEED TO PRODUCE MORE PROTEIN

02:10:05.497 --> 02:10:07.166
IT'S GONNA COME FROM AQUACULTURE.

02:10:07.232 --> 02:10:11.837
THE OTHER COUPLE OF FACTOIDS.

02:10:11.904 --> 02:10:14.039
IT HAS A LOW CONVERSION.

02:10:14.106 --> 02:10:15.874
RATE FOR RACING PROTEIN.

02:10:15.941 --> 02:10:17.910
AS OPPOSED TO OTHER PROTEINS

02:10:17.976 --> 02:10:19.478
THAT WE CAN RAISE LARGELY DUE TO

02:10:19.545 --> 02:10:20.913
THE FACT THEY'RE IN WATER AND

02:10:20.979 --> 02:10:22.080
THERE'S NO GRAVITY.

02:10:22.147 --> 02:10:23.182
THE CONVERSION RATES ARE

02:10:23.248 --> 02:10:24.816
OUTSTANDING.

02:10:24.883 --> 02:10:27.286
IN ITS NON CONSUMPTIVE --

02:10:27.352 --> 02:10:29.288
IT AS FAR AS FRESH WATER THAT IS

02:10:29.354 --> 02:10:32.124
THE WATER THAT LEAVES FISH FARMS

02:10:32.191 --> 02:10:33.926
IS OF THE SAME OR HIGHER QUALITY

02:10:33.992 --> 02:10:35.894
THAN WATER ENTERING THE FISH

02:10:35.961 --> 02:10:36.995
FARMS.

02:10:37.062 --> 02:10:39.064
ESPECIALLY WITH AGRICULTURAL

02:10:39.131 --> 02:10:41.533
NEIGHBORS ENJOYING THE WASTE

02:10:41.600 --> 02:10:43.435
WATER THAT WE SHARE WITH THEM.

02:10:43.502 --> 02:10:45.137
AND OF COURSE WHEN YOU FARM

02:10:45.204 --> 02:10:47.072
MARINE SPECIES THERE'S NO NEED

02:10:47.139 --> 02:10:48.640
FOR FRESH WATER. TO PRODUCE THE

02:10:48.707 --> 02:10:50.075
FOOD.

02:10:50.142 --> 02:10:52.244
AND THEN LASTLY.

02:10:52.311 --> 02:10:53.679
CALIFORNIA OCEANS RESOURCE

02:10:53.745 --> 02:10:55.914
ENHANCEMENT HATCHERY PROGRAM.

IT'S SOUTH OF POINT CONCEPTION.

02:11:00.819 --> 02:11:02.487
IT INCLUDES ONLY THE DEDICATED

02:11:18.136 --> 02:11:18.704
SOME TWO MILLION FISH HAVE BEEN

02:11:18.770 --> 02:11:20.339
PRODUCED. TO AUGMENT THE TAKE OF

SHARING WITH YOU HOW WORK THAT

02:39:53.016 --> 02:39:53.884
WAS LAUNCHED DURING THAT TIME

02:39:53.951 --> 02:39:55.919
PERIOD HAS HAD SUBSEQUENT IMPACT

02:39:55.986 --> 02:39:57.321
AND HOW WE CONTINUE TO MAKE

02:39:57.387 --> 02:39:58.622
PROGRESS.

02:39:58.689 --> 02:40:00.457
THE FIRST IS THAT A BIG SORT OF

02:40:00.524 --> 02:40:02.125
HIGH LEVEL GENERAL --

02:40:02.192 --> 02:40:04.161
LAST YEAR WOKING WITH THE

02:40:04.227 --> 02:40:05.629
EXPERT PANEL FROM THIS OPEN

02:40:05.696 --> 02:40:06.930
OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL SCIENCE

02:40:06.997 --> 02:40:09.333
ADVISORY TEAM WE PRODUCED THE

02:40:09.399 --> 02:40:11.068
FIRST EVER COAST IN OCEAN

02:40:11.134 --> 02:40:12.502
SYNTHESIS --

02:40:12.569 --> 02:40:14.871
AS PART OF CALIFORNIA'S FOURTH

02:40:14.938 --> 02:40:16.540
CLIMATE ASSESSMENT.

02:40:16.606 --> 02:40:19.142
THIS REPORT REPRESENTS A SHIFT

02:40:19.209 --> 02:40:20.877
FROM.

02:40:20.944 --> 02:40:22.913
I WOULD SAY MERELY BUT IT IT --

02:40:22.980 --> 02:40:24.114
COMMENCE --

02:40:24.181 --> 02:40:26.883
PROJECTING CHANGE AND IMPACTS TO

02:40:26.950 --> 02:40:28.685
ALSO BEGINNING THAT DIALOGUE ON

02:40:28.752 --> 02:40:32.723
SOLUTIONS AND ADAPTATION OPTIONS.

02:40:32.789 --> 02:40:35.125
SO AS A SCIENCE ADVISORY TEAM WE

02:40:35.192 --> 02:40:37.928
CAN NOW LOOK TO FIND WAYS TO

02:40:37.995 --> 02:40:39.863
LIFT AND LEVERAGE AND ENGAGE

02:40:39.930 --> 02:40:42.566

02:40:48.872 --> 02:40:50.841
LIKE WHAT ROLE DOES ON NETWORK

02:40:50.907 --> 02:40:52.342
OF MARINE PROTECTED AREAS PLAY

02:40:52.409 --> 02:40:54.177
HOW DO WE YOU SEE CROSSES AND

02:40:54.244 --> 02:40:55.579
HELP FORESTS.

02:40:55.645 --> 02:40:56.780
HOW DO WE STRENGTHEN THE

02:40:56.847 --> 02:40:59.983
OBSERVATION OF THE STATE AND THE

02:41:00.050 --> 02:41:01.651
WEALTH OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE

02:41:01.718 --> 02:41:02.886
THAT IS HOUSE NOT JUST IN

02:41:02.953 --> 02:41:05.355
ACADEMIA BUT ALSO IN IN FISHING

02:41:05.422 --> 02:41:07.891
AND FRONT LINE COMMUNITIES?

02:41:07.958 --> 02:41:09.026
THE DRILLING DOWN THAN THE

02:41:09.092 --> 02:41:10.127
SECOND PROJECT THAT I JUST

02:41:10.193 --> 02:41:12.596
QUICKLY WANTED TO TO HIGHLIGHTS.

02:41:12.662 --> 02:41:14.831
IS M. REFERENCED WITHIN THAT

02:41:14.898 --> 02:41:17.134
BROAD SYNTHESIS BUT IS LOOKING A

02:41:17.200 --> 02:41:18.935
LITTLE BIT MORE AT ADAPTING TO

02:41:19.002 --> 02:41:20.337
CLIMATE CHANGE IN CALIFORNIA'S

02:41:20.404 --> 02:41:21.738
FISHERIES AND FISHING

02:41:21.805 --> 02:41:23.006
COMMUNITIES.

02:41:23.073 --> 02:41:24.875
THIS WORK WAS LAUNCHED IN TWO

02:41:24.941 --> 02:41:26.309
THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN AGAIN WITH

02:41:26.376 --> 02:41:28.378
AN EXPERT PANEL FROM THE SCIENCE

02:41:28.445 --> 02:41:29.880
ADVISORY TEAM.

02:41:29.946 --> 02:41:32.215
WHO DISTILLED WHAT YOU WHAT YOU

02:41:32.282 --> 02:41:34.184
ALL KNOW IS JUST AN AMAZING

02:41:34.251 --> 02:41:36.953
COMPLEXITY OF SCIENTIFIC?

02:41:37.020 --> 02:41:39.122
RESEARCH AND DATA INTO FOR

02:41:39.189 --> 02:41:42.125
POTENTIAL FUTURE SCENARIOS --

02:41:42.192 --> 02:41:43.293
FOR CALIFORNIA'S OCEAN

02:41:43.360 --> 02:41:45.295
ENVIRONMENT AND USE THAT AS A

02:41:45.362 --> 02:41:47.397
WAY TO LAUNCH A CONVERSATION

02:41:47.464 --> 02:41:49.699
ABOUT SEX OF PRAGMATIC

02:41:49.766 --> 02:41:52.335
MANAGEMENT OPTIONS AND CHANGES

02:41:52.402 --> 02:41:53.804
THAT COULD SUPPORT.

02:41:53.870 --> 02:41:56.573
ADAPTING FISHERIES IN FISHING

02:41:56.640 --> 02:41:57.974
COMMUNITIES TO CLIMATE CHANGE.

02:41:58.041 --> 02:41:59.276
TODAY BUILDING ON THAT

02:41:59.342 --> 02:42:00.977
FOUNDATIONAL WORK AND WITH

02:42:01.044 --> 02:42:03.246
ADDITIONAL PHILANTHROPIC SUPPORT.

02:42:03.313 --> 02:42:06.416
WE'RE ABLE TO CONVENE A A BROAD

02:42:06.483 --> 02:42:09.319
ARRAY OF STAKEHOLDERS MANAGES --

02:42:09.386 --> 02:42:12.122
COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO EXPLORE

02:42:12.189 --> 02:42:14.224
WHAT THE SPECIFIC TOOLS THE

02:42:14.291 --> 02:42:16.093
LEAVE AS THE MANAGEMENT LEAVE US

02:42:16.159 --> 02:42:17.394
AN OPTIONS ARE.

02:42:17.461 --> 02:42:20.764
THEY CAN HELP --

02:42:20.831 --> 02:42:23.266
TO SORT OF BUFFET BUILDERS THIS

02:42:23.333 --> 02:42:25.102
GAIL AND HOW THOSE MIGHT LOOK

02:42:25.168 --> 02:42:27.270
MEANT AND TWEAK AND MODIFIED THE

02:42:27.337 --> 02:42:28.939
THE BROADER FISHERY MANAGEMENT

02:42:29.005 --> 02:42:30.607
STRUCTURE THAT EXISTS THAT A

02:42:30.674 --> 02:42:34.177
STATE WIDE SCALE.

02:42:34.244 --> 02:42:35.712
AND SO BECAUSE I'M LOST I'M

02:42:35.779 --> 02:42:38.515
GONNA MAKE THIS VERY BRIEF --

02:42:38.582 --> 02:42:40.917
TURNING THEN --

02:42:40.984 --> 02:42:42.319
TO OUR OCEAN SCIENCE TRYST --

02:42:42.385 --> 02:42:44.121
STRATEGIC VISION RECENTLY

02:42:44.187 --> 02:42:45.055
UPDATED --

02:42:45.122 --> 02:42:47.858
WITHOUT BOARD OF TRUSTEES THEM

02:42:47.924 --> 02:42:49.359
AND SUPPORT FROM UP HOTNESS.

02:42:49.426 --> 02:42:51.027
I WANTED TO JUST EXPRESS TO YOU

02:42:51.094 --> 02:42:52.195
THAT -- WE

02:42:52.262 --> 02:42:53.830
TAKE PRIDE IN AS A NON PROFIT

02:42:53.897 --> 02:42:56.166
ORGANIZATION NIMBLE RESPONSE TO

02:42:56.233 --> 02:42:57.701
OPPORTUNITIES FOR SCIENCE TO

02:42:57.767 --> 02:43:00.504
HAVE A MEANINGFUL IMPACT ON

02:43:00.570 --> 02:43:01.738
POLICY.

02:43:01.805 --> 02:43:03.874
OUR UPDATED STRATEGIC VISION IS

02:43:03.940 --> 02:43:05.408
ORIENTED TO THE TWENTY YEAR

02:43:05.475 --> 02:43:06.877
ANNIVERSARY OF OUR FOUNDING

02:43:06.943 --> 02:43:08.478
LEGISLATION --

02:43:08.545 --> 02:43:10.780

I'M NEW TO THIS ROLE I HAVE BEEN

02:43:17.721 --> 02:43:19.322
WITH THE ORGANIZATION FOR TEN

02:43:19.389 --> 02:43:20.924
YEARS -- AND

02:43:20.991 --> 02:43:22.993
I FEEL VERY PRIVILEGED TO HAVE

02:43:23.059 --> 02:43:24.928
THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THROUGH

CRITICAL PERIOD OF THE YEAR IS

02:44:53.883 --> 02:44:56.052

COLD WEATHER PATTERNS THE

02:45:00.890 --> 02:45:02.993
RAINFALL THAT WE'RE HAVING --

02:45:03.059 --> 02:45:04.761

TOP OF IT WERE NOT SEEN IT IS

02:45:37.027 --> 02:45:37.927
BEEN A SLOW MOVING TRAIN.

02:45:37.994 --> 02:45:40.063
BE ABLE TO SEE THAT THE DISASTER

02:45:40.130 --> 02:45:40.630
RELIEF COMING IN.

YOU HEARING FROM THOSE WHO

02:45:49.172 --> 02:45:50.874
YOU'RE WORKING WITH.

02:45:50.940 --> 02:45:51.608
I THE TASK FORCE IS MAINLY

02:45:51.675 --> 02:45:53.143
CONCERNED WITH MAKING SURE THAT

02:45:53.209 --> 02:45:55.812
THE FISHERY OPERATES IN A

02:45:55.879 --> 02:45:57.047
FASHION THAT EVERYBODY SEEMS

02:45:57.113 --> 02:45:58.048
REALLY AND SO.

02:45:58.114 --> 02:45:58.715
I THINK THE TASK FORCE WAS

02:45:58.782 --> 02:45:59.849
ESTABLISHED I MEAN WHEN IT WAS

02:45:59.916 --> 02:46:02.185
ESTABLISHED BACK IN TWO THOUSAND

02:46:02.252 --> 02:46:03.353
NINE WE DON'T HAVE TO MOW GAS

02:46:03.420 --> 02:46:03.920
THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE WAYLAND

02:46:03.987 --> 02:46:04.621
TANGLE MINUTES.

02:46:04.688 --> 02:46:07.324
SO THESE ISSUES ARE VERY NEW TO

02:46:07.390 --> 02:46:11.428
THE A LOT OF ENERGY FOR THEM TO

02:46:11.494 --> 02:46:12.862
DISCUSS THEY ARE DISCUSSING IN

02:46:12.929 --> 02:46:13.963
THE SERRATION ORDERS AND THINGS

02:46:14.030 --> 02:46:14.230
LIKE THAT.

02:46:14.297 --> 02:46:17.000
AND YEAH I THINK THEY'RE THE

02:46:17.067 --> 02:46:18.568
TASK FORCE'S MAIN GOAL IS JUST

02:46:18.635 --> 02:46:20.136
TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE A

02:46:20.203 --> 02:46:21.738
SUSTAINABLE INDUSTRY.

02:46:21.805 --> 02:46:23.039
AND SOME OF THAT IS LOOKING AT

02:46:23.106 --> 02:46:24.307
THESE BIG ISSUES AND ALSO

02:46:24.374 --> 02:46:25.875
LOOKING AT THE EXISTING

02:46:25.942 --> 02:46:27.844
REGULATIONS AND MAKING SURE THAT.

02:46:27.911 --> 02:46:31.381
THAT DOES WORK FOR THE INDUSTRY.

02:46:31.448 --> 02:46:32.015
ONE OF THE ITEMS THAT WE REMAIN

02:46:32.082 --> 02:46:34.651
CONCERNED ABOUT AND WHAT WE WERE

02:46:34.718 --> 02:46:35.518
ASKING --

02:46:35.585 --> 02:46:36.920
STRICTER BOTTOM LINE IS  LACK

02:46:36.986 --> 02:46:38.254
OF RESOURCES THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:46:38.321 --> 02:46:40.223
PUBLIC HEALTH SIDE ON THE

02:46:40.290 --> 02:46:41.291
TESTING SITE --

02:46:41.358 --> 02:46:42.959
IN IN OUR ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO

02:46:43.026 --> 02:46:45.095
PICK IT QUICKLY I HAD TO BE ABLE

02:46:45.161 --> 02:46:46.463
TO ASSIST.

02:46:46.529 --> 02:46:47.831
ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT.

02:46:47.897 --> 02:46:48.665
IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE TASK

02:46:48.732 --> 02:46:49.599
FORCE IS ABSOLUTELY BROUGHT UP

02:46:49.666 --> 02:46:50.967
THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE FASTER

02:46:51.034 --> 02:46:53.103
PROCESSING OF THE SAMPLES FROM

02:46:53.169 --> 02:46:55.338
DENMARK ACID AND HAD.

02:46:55.405 --> 02:46:57.741
MADE REQUESTS TO THAT EFFECT IS

02:46:57.807 --> 02:46:59.476
IT BEN WITH THAT THE LABS OR IS

02:46:59.542 --> 02:47:01.878
IT NOT ENOUGH RESOURCES WHAT'S

02:47:01.945 --> 02:47:04.481
YOUR BUT I COULDN'T.

02:47:04.547 --> 02:47:05.482
I COULDN'T.

02:47:05.548 --> 02:47:06.649
IT'S NOT MY PLACE I DON'T WORK

02:47:06.716 --> 02:47:07.717
FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC

02:47:07.784 --> 02:47:09.386
HEALTH WE JUST KNOW WHAT THEY'VE

02:47:09.452 --> 02:47:10.553
TOLD US THAT.

02:47:10.620 --> 02:47:12.522
IT'S THERE'S A LOT OF SAMPLES

02:47:12.589 --> 02:47:13.656
COMING IN THIS THE STATE OF

02:47:13.723 --> 02:47:15.592
CALIFORNIA IS MUCH BIGGER THAN

02:47:15.658 --> 02:47:17.160
OREGON AND WASHINGTON SO WE HAVE.

02:47:17.227 --> 02:47:18.962
MUCH HIGHER VOLUME OF SAMPLES

02:47:19.028 --> 02:47:20.463
COMING INTO THEIR SO.

02:47:20.530 --> 02:47:22.999
I IMAGINE IT IS A COMBINATION OF

02:47:23.066 --> 02:47:24.834
FACTORS THERE CAUSING A DELAY.

02:47:24.901 --> 02:47:25.835
IN AN ITEM THAT SAKE WAS TALKING

02:47:25.902 --> 02:47:26.770
ABOUT WHICH WERE VERY GRATEFUL

IBM TO GET EVERYONE ON THE SAME

02:47:30.507 --> 02:47:33.476
PAGE ON THE WEST COAST HOW DO

02:47:33.543 --> 02:47:34.110
YOU THINK THAT'S CAN IMPACT THE

02:47:34.177 --> 02:47:34.477
FISHERY.

02:47:34.544 --> 02:47:35.211
I THINK THAT WILL BE OF A

02:47:35.278 --> 02:47:37.614
POSITIVE THERE'S A LOT OF TALK

02:47:37.680 --> 02:47:40.183
TALK AND IT DOESN'T JUST STOP AT

02:47:40.250 --> 02:47:42.252
THE STATE LINE SO HAVING THAT

02:47:42.318 --> 02:47:43.420
THAT TRI STATE DISCUSSION I

02:47:43.486 --> 02:47:45.221
THINK IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF

02:47:45.288 --> 02:47:46.189
THE ENTIRE FLEET.

IN THE COMING YEARS TO COME --

02:48:10.313 --> 02:48:13.450
OCEAN ACIDIFICATION SIR THEM IT.

02:48:13.516 --> 02:48:15.285
IN CRUDE TERMS THE REDUCING PH

02:48:15.351 --> 02:48:16.853
OF OCEAN WATERS BUT THEY

02:48:16.920 --> 02:48:18.188
ACTUALLY ISSUES A FORMAL

02:48:18.254 --> 02:48:20.557
COMPLICATED THOUGHTS AND REALLY --

02:48:20.623 --> 02:48:22.358
INTERTWINED WITH THEM BROUGHT TO

02:48:22.425 --> 02:48:25.495
CHANGES IN OCEAN CHEMISTRY AND

02:48:25.562 --> 02:48:26.763
OCEAN TEMPERATURE --

02:48:26.830 --> 02:48:29.332
I THINK WE ARE --

02:48:29.399 --> 02:48:31.734
WE ARE POISED TO BE SORT OF HAVE

02:48:31.801 --> 02:48:33.570
FRONT LINE IMPACTS ON THE WEST

02:48:33.636 --> 02:48:35.605
COAST AS A RESULT OF THE

02:48:35.672 --> 02:48:37.040
PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT OF THE UP

02:48:37.106 --> 02:48:38.808
WELLING OF COLD NUTRIENT RICH

02:48:38.875 --> 02:48:39.876
WATERS.

02:48:39.943 --> 02:48:42.412
AND IT WAS IN RECOGNITION OF

02:48:42.479 --> 02:48:43.246

I THE STATE I THINK IS ON THE

02:48:45.281 --> 02:48:47.951
FRONT LINE OF ACTION TO ADDRESS --

02:48:48.017 --> 02:48:49.419
OCEAN ACIDIFICATION.

02:48:49.486 --> 02:48:50.787
IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE OCEAN

02:48:50.854 --> 02:48:52.388
PROTECTION COUNCIL WE CONVENED A

02:48:52.455 --> 02:48:53.957
SCIENCE PANEL THAT LOOKED AT THE

02:48:54.023 --> 02:48:54.924
ISSUE.

02:48:54.991 --> 02:48:57.727
AND PROVIDED A SATYR OF

02:48:57.794 --> 02:48:59.896

MANAGEMENT OPTIONS FOR THE STATE

02:49:01.998 --> 02:49:04.133
TO ADDRESS THIS IS ACTUALLY BEEN.

02:49:04.200 --> 02:49:08.004
SUBSEQUENT TO ADAM TO THAT AS

02:49:08.071 --> 02:49:09.806
SUCH THE LET THE DEVELOPMENTS --

IN COLLABORATION WITH US AND

02:49:11.474 --> 02:49:12.842
MANY OTHERS OF AN OCEAN

02:49:12.909 --> 02:49:15.078
ACIDIFICATION ACTION PLAN THAT

02:49:15.144 --> 02:49:16.779
REALLY LAYS OUT A ROAD MAP OF

02:49:16.846 --> 02:49:19.449
ACTIONS ALONG THE WEST COAST AND

02:49:19.516 --> 02:49:21.484
AND FOCUSED ON CALIFORNIA. TO

02:49:21.551 --> 02:49:23.052
DEEPEN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THIS

02:49:23.119 --> 02:49:25.154
ISSUE IT IS AN ISSUE OF RAPIDLY

02:49:25.221 --> 02:49:26.489
EVOLVING ANTI PAINTING

02:49:26.556 --> 02:49:28.658
SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING BUT

02:49:28.725 --> 02:49:30.860
ALSO BEGINNING TO PRO ACTIVELY

02:49:30.927 --> 02:49:32.228
ACT -- AND

02:49:32.295 --> 02:49:34.931
PILOTS NEW APPROACHES THAT LOOK

02:49:34.998 --> 02:49:38.101
AT THINGS LIKE SEA GRASSES --

02:49:38.167 --> 02:49:39.269
AS M..

02:49:39.335 --> 02:49:40.570
AREAS WHERE YOU MIGHT FIND LOCAL

02:49:40.637 --> 02:49:43.439
AMELIORATION POTENTIAL --

02:49:43.506 --> 02:49:45.174
AND PILOTS AND KNEW IT NEW

02:49:45.241 --> 02:49:46.709
PARTNERSHIPS NEW COLLABORATIONS

02:49:46.776 --> 02:49:48.311
WITH FISHING COMMUNITIES TO

02:49:48.378 --> 02:49:49.679
BEGIN.

02:49:49.746 --> 02:49:51.848
TO LOOK AT HOW WE MIGHT SUPPORT

02:49:51.915 --> 02:49:54.617
ADAPTATION STEPS INTO THE FUTURE

02:49:54.684 --> 02:49:55.785
THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM THAT IS

02:49:55.852 --> 02:49:57.620
GOING TO WE'RE GOING TO MANAGE

02:49:57.687 --> 02:49:59.188
OUR WAY AFTER THE VISIT IS A

02:49:59.255 --> 02:50:00.890
GLOBAL PROBLEM --

02:50:00.957 --> 02:50:02.559
SO I THINK FINDING THOSE WAYS

02:50:02.625 --> 02:50:07.497
THAT WE CAN --

02:50:07.564 --> 02:50:08.731
SO TO MITIGATE IMPACTS --

02:50:08.798 --> 02:50:10.066
IT IS IS GOING TO BE VERY

02:50:10.133 --> 02:50:11.367
IMPORTANT IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

02:50:11.434 --> 02:50:14.037
CANDIDLY HOW FAR BEHIND.

02:50:14.103 --> 02:50:15.071
THE EIGHT BALL DO YOU BELIEVE

02:50:15.138 --> 02:50:17.574
CALIFORNIA IS AT THIS POINT.

02:50:17.640 --> 02:50:19.842
OF BEING ABLE TO REACT TO WHAT

02:50:19.909 --> 02:50:22.879
THAT NEW REALITY IS.

02:50:22.946 --> 02:50:24.414
I CANDIDLY --

02:50:24.480 --> 02:50:26.816
I'VE I FEEL VERY PLEASED TO BE

02:50:26.883 --> 02:50:28.318
IN CALIFORNIA --

02:50:28.384 --> 02:50:30.720
WORKING ON THIS ISSUE ISSUE WE

02:50:30.787 --> 02:50:32.855
ARE ONE OF THE FIRST STATES TO

02:50:32.922 --> 02:50:34.991
PRODUCE AN ACTION PLAN AND TO

02:50:35.058 --> 02:50:37.660
HAVE PRIORITY TO INVEST IN THAT

02:50:37.727 --> 02:50:39.329
ACTION PLAN --

02:50:39.395 --> 02:50:41.130
SO I THINK WE ARE POISED TO

02:50:41.197 --> 02:50:42.632
TACKLE IT IN THE BEST WAY THAT

02:50:42.699 --> 02:50:44.033
WE CAN.

02:50:44.100 --> 02:50:45.435
IN DO YOU BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD

02:50:45.501 --> 02:50:47.670
BE TAKING --

02:50:47.737 --> 02:50:48.838
HERE IN CALIFORNIA OR WORKING

02:50:48.905 --> 02:50:50.373
WITH HER PEERS --

02:50:50.440 --> 02:50:51.808
THROUGHOUT THE WEST COAST WHAT'S

02:50:51.874 --> 02:50:53.710
YOUR TAKE ON IT --

02:50:53.776 --> 02:50:55.078
PEERS THROUGHOUT THE WEST COAST

02:50:55.144 --> 02:50:56.713
AND ALSO INTERNATIONALLY I MEAN

02:50:56.779 --> 02:50:58.581
FUNDAMENTALLY THIS IS A GLOBAL

02:50:58.648 --> 02:51:00.416
COP AN ISSUE AS WELL --

02:51:00.483 --> 02:51:02.085
AND  THINK IT CARS BOTH THE

02:51:02.151 --> 02:51:04.420
LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL DIALOG

02:51:04.487 --> 02:51:06.990
EXTRA THANK YOU SO MUCH.

02:51:07.056 --> 02:51:09.525
THIS RESTAURANT.

02:51:09.592 --> 02:51:10.860
I GUESS JUST A FEW COMMENTS AND

02:51:10.927 --> 02:51:11.561
IF WE START.

02:51:11.628 --> 02:51:14.530
BROADLY AS TALKING TO SCIENTISTS

02:51:14.597 --> 02:51:16.933
ABOUT THE NORTH EASTERN PACIFIC

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:19.068
OCEAN THE THING I THINK WE HAVE

02:51:19.135 --> 02:51:20.837
TO KEEP IN MIND.

02:51:20.903 --> 02:51:22.238
THEY TALK ABOUT THAT ESPECIALLY

02:51:22.305 --> 02:51:22.739
ONES THAT ARE.

02:51:22.805 --> 02:51:25.041
TRACKING RIGHT ORGANISMS.

02:51:25.108 --> 02:51:26.676
LARGE SCALE.

02:51:26.743 --> 02:51:28.211
PROJECT READ ORGANISMS THERE'S

02:51:28.277 --> 02:51:32.982
MORE AS MUCH OR MORE VARIETY AND

02:51:33.049 --> 02:51:34.317
AND CAPACITY IS THEY TALK ABOUT

02:51:34.384 --> 02:51:35.918
IS THEIR DADDY WE WE THINK WE

02:51:35.985 --> 02:51:37.920
HAVE IMAGES OF THE SERENGETI

02:51:37.987 --> 02:51:38.655
DESERT AND THAT.

02:51:38.721 --> 02:51:39.856
THE NUMBER OF ORGANISMS AND HOW

02:51:39.922 --> 02:51:41.524
EXCITING THAT IS WE HAVE THAT

02:51:41.591 --> 02:51:43.159
OFF OF OUR SHORES.

02:51:43.226 --> 02:51:44.961
AND WE SEE A LITTLE BIT OF THAT

02:51:45.028 --> 02:51:45.561
AND WE'RE TALKING A LOT ABOUT

02:51:45.628 --> 02:51:46.729
THIS.

02:51:46.796 --> 02:51:48.131
IN OUR INSHORE WATERS WE TALK

02:51:48.197 --> 02:51:49.332
ABOUT THE FISHERY FISHING

02:51:49.399 --> 02:51:51.234
INDUSTRY BUT THIS IS WHAT'S WITH

02:51:51.300 --> 02:51:52.669
ULTIMATELY AT STAKE.

02:51:52.735 --> 02:51:55.438
AND WITH THE OCEAN BEING THE THE

02:51:55.505 --> 02:51:57.106
BUFFER FOR A LOT OF THE CHANGES

02:51:57.173 --> 02:51:58.608
THAT WE'RE SEEING IN CLIMATE THE

02:51:58.675 --> 02:52:00.143
MORE WE KNOW IN THE MORE WE WORK

02:52:00.209 --> 02:52:01.778
WITH OUR INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS

02:52:01.844 --> 02:52:03.179
AND ESPECIALLY UP AND DOWN.

02:52:03.246 --> 02:52:05.948
THE EASTERN PACIFIC OCEAN NORTH

02:52:06.015 --> 02:52:07.750
EASTERN PACIFIC OCEAN THAT THE

02:52:07.817 --> 02:52:09.152
MORE INROADS I THINK WE CAN MAKE

02:52:09.218 --> 02:52:10.753
BUT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE PROTECTING

02:52:10.820 --> 02:52:11.721
AND THAT'S WHAT'S WORTH LOOKING

02:52:11.788 --> 02:52:14.691
AT KEEPING THAT VIBRANT.

02:52:14.757 --> 02:52:16.125
OCEAN ENVIRONMENTS AND THE

02:52:16.192 --> 02:52:17.260
FISHERIES INVOLVED IN IT WITH

02:52:17.326 --> 02:52:19.095
ALL OF ITS ECONOMIC POTENTIAL

02:52:19.162 --> 02:52:21.264
AND AND ALL OF ITS HUMAN

02:52:21.330 --> 02:52:23.032
POTENTIAL THAT THAT REPRESENTS.

02:52:23.099 --> 02:52:24.734
AND I THINK CALIFORNIA IS.

02:52:24.801 --> 02:52:26.235
ALWAYS PRETTY WELL BECAUSE OF

02:52:26.302 --> 02:52:27.470
WHAT WILL BE DONE AND WHAT.

02:52:27.537 --> 02:52:29.172
THE OCEANSIDE STRESS DOES THAN

02:52:29.238 --> 02:52:31.374
WHAT THE THE OCEAN PROTECTION

02:52:31.441 --> 02:52:32.241
COUNCIL IS.

02:52:32.308 --> 02:52:34.010
BRINGING REAL SCIENCE INTO THE

02:52:34.077 --> 02:52:36.612
CONVERSATION AND I HAVE TO ADMIT

02:52:36.679 --> 02:52:39.515
THAT LISTENING TO THE FISHERMEN

02:52:39.582 --> 02:52:41.250
TALK HERE AND THIS CONVERSATION

02:52:41.317 --> 02:52:43.052
THE CONNECTION BETWEEN WHAT'S

02:52:43.119 --> 02:52:44.721
HAPPENING ON SHORE WOULD WE'VE

02:52:44.787 --> 02:52:46.522
BEEN TALKING ABOUT WILDFIRES

02:52:46.589 --> 02:52:46.723
HERE.

02:52:46.789 --> 02:52:48.257
IN THE FISHERIES COUNCIL.

02:52:48.324 --> 02:52:49.792
AND WHAT HAPPENS N SHORE WITH

02:52:49.859 --> 02:52:51.227
WHAT HAPPENS OFF SHORE SOMETHING

02:52:51.294 --> 02:52:52.895
THAT IS JUST IN THE EIGHT TO THE

02:52:52.962 --> 02:52:55.098
FLEET AND TO THOSE INTERACTIONS.

02:52:55.164 --> 02:52:56.599
BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT HOW

02:52:56.666 --> 02:52:58.835
CALIFORNIA'S BEEN STRUCTURED.

02:52:58.901 --> 02:53:00.837
AGENCY BY AGENCY OR DIFFERENT

02:53:00.903 --> 02:53:03.473
GROUPS THEY TEND TO BE FRESH

02:53:03.539 --> 02:53:05.475
WATER FOCUSED OR SO.

02:53:05.541 --> 02:53:07.510
AND THIS IS THE A VERY

02:53:07.577 --> 02:53:08.678
INTERESTING PLACE WHERE THAT ALL

02:53:08.745 --> 02:53:10.546
COMES TOGETHER.

02:53:10.613 --> 02:53:11.581
BECAUSE IT COMES TOGETHER

02:53:11.647 --> 02:53:13.249
NATURALLY HERE FISHERMEN

02:53:13.316 --> 02:53:14.617
UNDERSTAND THAT PLEASE.

02:53:14.684 --> 02:53:16.519
SO WAS AS WE RAZORS YOU RAISE

02:53:16.586 --> 02:53:17.920
THE ISSUE OF TESTING AND THE

02:53:17.987 --> 02:53:19.922
FUNDS THAT ARE NECESSARY I ALSO

02:53:19.989 --> 02:53:20.857
KNOW THAT.

02:53:20.923 --> 02:53:22.191
THAT WITH THE WAY WE'VE DONE

02:53:22.258 --> 02:53:24.894
FISH COUNTING WONDERING OTHER

02:53:24.961 --> 02:53:26.529
MONITORING THEIR FEDERAL FUNDED

02:53:26.596 --> 02:53:28.264
STATE FUNDS THAT ARE NOT

02:53:28.331 --> 02:53:30.032
NECESSARILY WE'RE REALLY AT RISK

02:53:30.099 --> 02:53:32.835
OF LOSING THIS LONG TERM.

02:53:32.902 --> 02:53:35.037
SCIENTIFIC BASIS IF WE STOP OR

02:53:35.104 --> 02:53:37.273
IF WE ALLOW TO STOP THE KINDS OF

02:53:37.340 --> 02:53:39.408
MONITORING THAT HAS HAPPENED.

02:53:39.475 --> 02:53:40.843
AND WATER QUALITY MONITORING

02:53:40.910 --> 02:53:44.147
WHETHER IT'S ON OR OFFSHORE.

02:53:44.213 --> 02:53:46.349
THAT OCEAN CONDITIONS THAT

02:53:46.415 --> 02:53:48.584
CHEMISTRY THE OCEAN WE HAVE TO

02:53:48.651 --> 02:53:49.819
MAKE SURE WE ARE COLLECTING IN

02:53:49.886 --> 02:53:51.220
INVESTING IN.

02:53:51.287 --> 02:53:53.222
THAT BROADER SCIENTIFIC DATA SO

02:53:53.289 --> 02:53:54.524
THAT WE CAN BRING THEM TO THESE

02:53:54.590 --> 02:53:56.192
KINDS OF FOR AND SOCIAL

02:53:56.259 --> 02:53:56.826
PROTECTION COUNCIL AT OCEANSIDE

02:53:56.893 --> 02:53:58.861
STRESSED.

02:53:58.928 --> 02:53:59.729
AND MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE.

02:53:59.796 --> 02:54:00.863
THE DATA TO START TO KNOW WHAT

02:54:00.930 --> 02:54:02.231
TO DO BECAUSE ULTIMATELY WITH

02:54:02.298 --> 02:54:03.666
THE CHANGING CHEMISTRY AND THE

02:54:03.733 --> 02:54:05.535
IMPACT THAT THAT'S GOING TO HAVE

02:54:05.601 --> 02:54:07.270
THESE ARE VERY LARGE INTRACTABLE

02:54:07.336 --> 02:54:08.237
PROBLEMS.

02:54:08.304 --> 02:54:09.405
AND WE'RE SEEING A WEATHER WITH

02:54:09.472 --> 02:54:10.640
TIMO CASTED CHANGING

02:54:10.706 --> 02:54:11.874
TEMPERATURES THAT ARE DRIVING

02:54:11.941 --> 02:54:12.975
SPECIES CHANGES THAT WE'RE

02:54:13.042 --> 02:54:14.343
STARTING TO SEE ON A REAL TIME

02:54:14.410 --> 02:54:15.411
BASIS.

02:54:15.478 --> 02:54:16.879
AND HOW WE MANAGE THIS BIG

02:54:16.946 --> 02:54:19.048
QUESTION BECOMES.

02:54:19.115 --> 02:54:20.616
VERY DIFFICULT THREE TWO BUT WE

02:54:20.683 --> 02:54:22.151
ARE STARTING WITH THOSE THE

02:54:22.218 --> 02:54:24.187
PIECES TOGETHER AND THROUGH THIS

02:54:24.253 --> 02:54:26.289
COMMITTEE.

02:54:26.355 --> 02:54:27.824
AND THROUGH OTHERS.

02:54:27.890 --> 02:54:28.491
MAKING SURE WE'RE BRINGING THAT

02:54:28.558 --> 02:54:29.725
THE SCIENCE IN THE LEGISLATIVE

02:54:29.792 --> 02:54:31.460
CONTACTS SO THAT WE KNOW WHAT TO

02:54:31.527 --> 02:54:32.662
DO AND WORKING MORE CLOSELY WITH

02:54:32.728 --> 02:54:33.863
THE ADMINISTRATION.

02:54:33.930 --> 02:54:36.165
IS IS A KEY FOR US COLLECTIVELY

02:54:36.232 --> 02:54:38.568
TO FIND OUR WAY THROUGH THIS AND

02:54:38.634 --> 02:54:40.303
I THINK WE'RE SEEING THAT

02:54:40.369 --> 02:54:42.305
AWARENESS AND THAT'S WHY.

02:54:42.371 --> 02:54:44.073
I HAD LUNCH IN THE SUMMERTIME.

02:54:44.140 --> 02:54:44.640
TO THIS COMMITTEE THIS JOINT

02:54:44.707 --> 02:54:45.508
COMMITTEE.

02:54:45.575 --> 02:54:47.109
MISTER CHAIR WITH UNDER YOUR

02:54:47.176 --> 02:54:48.077
LEADERSHIP THE FACT THAT WE ARE

02:54:48.144 --> 02:54:49.846
HAVING MORE HEARINGS THAT ARE

02:54:49.912 --> 02:54:51.647
HEARING OUR IN DEPTH THAT WE'RE

02:54:51.714 --> 02:54:53.049
NOT STARTING.

02:54:53.115 --> 02:54:54.617
WE'RE NOT JUST HEARING THIS AND

02:54:54.684 --> 02:54:56.185
WORKING WITH THE FISHERMEN ON AN

02:54:56.252 --> 02:54:58.287
ANNUAL BASIS YES THE FOOD LAST

02:54:58.354 --> 02:55:00.590
NIGHT WAS LOVELY AND WE DO THAT

02:55:00.656 --> 02:55:02.525
BUT THE ONGOING CONVERSATION AND

02:55:02.592 --> 02:55:03.893
BRING SCIENCE INTO.

02:55:03.960 --> 02:55:05.461
THE CONVERSATION ON A REGULAR

02:55:05.528 --> 02:55:08.364
BASIS IS IS REALLY WHAT WE NEED

02:55:08.431 --> 02:55:08.831
TO BE DOING.

02:55:08.898 --> 02:55:10.733
AND THAT'S WHY I AGREE WITH

02:55:10.800 --> 02:55:12.168
DOCTOR WHITE AND THAT I AM VERY

02:55:12.235 --> 02:55:13.502
HAPPY TO BE CALIFORNIA NOW AND

02:55:13.569 --> 02:55:15.404
VERY HOPEFUL THAT EVEN AS WE

02:55:15.471 --> 02:55:16.772
TACKLE DIFFICULT QUESTIONS.

02:55:16.839 --> 02:55:19.308
AND HAVE HAD LONG STANDING

02:55:19.375 --> 02:55:21.611
DEBATES IN CONVERSATIONS AMONG

02:55:21.677 --> 02:55:22.245
THE DIFFERENT SECTORS INVOLVED

02:55:22.311 --> 02:55:25.081
HERE.

02:55:25.147 --> 02:55:25.648
THAT WE ARE STARTING TO MAKE

02:55:25.715 --> 02:55:26.015
PROGRESS.

02:55:26.082 --> 02:55:27.516
ON INDIVIDUAL LEVELS BUT ALSO

02:55:27.583 --> 02:55:28.851
LOOKING AT THE BIGGER PICTURE

02:55:28.918 --> 02:55:31.053
WHICH IS ULTIMATELY SO IMPORTANT

02:55:31.120 --> 02:55:33.456
BECAUSE WE SIT ON THE SHORES OF

02:55:33.522 --> 02:55:35.725
ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT.

02:55:35.791 --> 02:55:36.792
PIECES OF WILDLIFE AND

02:55:36.859 --> 02:55:39.095
BIODIVERSITY IN THE WORLD AND

02:55:39.161 --> 02:55:40.997
AND THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO

02:55:41.063 --> 02:55:44.133
MAINTAIN AND TO TO HELP US

02:55:44.200 --> 02:55:46.736
MANAGE THIS WILL REALLY DOING

02:55:46.802 --> 02:55:48.070
HOPING WE IN THE LEGISLATURE

02:55:48.137 --> 02:55:49.005
NEEDS AS WE GO THROUGH THE

02:55:49.071 --> 02:55:50.106
BUDGET PROCESS.

02:55:50.172 --> 02:55:51.207
NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE

02:55:51.274 --> 02:55:52.909
SHORTFALLS IN TESTING.

02:55:52.975 --> 02:55:54.210
AND PROVIDE SOME OF THAT

02:55:54.277 --> 02:55:56.779
CONTINUITY AND BRING IN.

02:55:56.846 --> 02:55:59.482
THAT DOES NUTS AND BOLTS PIECES

02:55:59.548 --> 02:56:01.017
UPDATED THEY WORK SO THAT WE

02:56:01.083 --> 02:56:03.019
DON'T LOSE THE TRAJECTORY OF THE

02:56:03.085 --> 02:56:04.353
SCIENTIFIC DATA THAT THAT WE

02:56:04.420 --> 02:56:05.488
HAVE COLLECTED.

02:56:05.554 --> 02:56:06.889
SO THIS IS THE BUDGET

02:56:06.956 --> 02:56:08.557
SUBCOMMITTEES.

02:56:08.624 --> 02:56:09.959
AND THROUGH THAT PROCESS WE NEED

02:56:10.026 --> 02:56:11.661
TO BE LOOKING AT THAT AND AND

02:56:11.727 --> 02:56:12.762
LOOKING AT WHERE WE HAVE RELIED

02:56:12.828 --> 02:56:14.363
ON FEDERAL FUNDING AND WE MAY

02:56:14.430 --> 02:56:15.631
NOT BE ABLE TO RELY ON THAT

02:56:15.698 --> 02:56:17.767
ANYMORE OR WHERE THE STATE HAS

02:56:17.833 --> 02:56:19.235
BEEN FUN THE DIFFERENT PROJECTS

02:56:19.302 --> 02:56:19.769
PICTURE WE'RE TYING THOSE

02:56:19.835 --> 02:56:20.703
TOGETHER.

02:56:20.770 --> 02:56:22.471
AND FINDING THOSE IN A IN A

02:56:22.538 --> 02:56:24.407
SIGNIFICANT MANNER BECAUSE THE

02:56:24.473 --> 02:56:25.741
SCIENTISTS IN THE FASHION THAT

02:56:25.808 --> 02:56:26.609

CONSISTENT FUNDING FOR IS THE

02:58:24.827 --> 02:58:25.461
PLANNING.

02:58:25.528 --> 02:58:26.095
THE UP FRONT STRATEGIC PLANNING

02:58:26.162 --> 02:58:28.164
AND AND BUILDING IN THE SCIENCE

02:58:28.230 --> 02:58:29.932
INTO OUR RESTORATION AND THEN

WE NEED THAT SCIENTIFIC

02:58:33.302 --> 02:58:34.870
STRUCTURE AND THE DATA TO ENSURE

02:58:34.937 --> 02:58:36.572
THAT THE MONEY THAT WE SPEND.

02:58:36.639 --> 02:58:37.873
ITS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR

02:58:37.940 --> 02:58:39.942
NOW ARE BEING EFFECTIVE WE

02:58:40.009 --> 02:58:41.410
REALLY NEED THAT THAT SCIENTIFIC

02:58:41.477 --> 02:58:42.478
STRUCTURE IN IT AND IT DOESN'T

02:58:42.545 --> 02:58:43.879
COME FROM THE GRANT PROGRAMS

02:58:43.946 --> 02:58:44.680

02:58:44.747 --> 02:58:45.614
FUNDS.

02:58:45.681 --> 02:58:46.982
WE NEED A CONSISTENT SOURCE OF

02:58:47.049 --> 02:58:48.517
FUNDING TO DO THOSE THINGS.

02:58:48.584 --> 02:58:51.287
IT WAS JUST TALKING WITH THE

02:58:51.353 --> 02:58:52.888
SECRETARIES OF ABOUT THIS AS WE

02:58:52.955 --> 02:58:54.690

02:58:54.757 --> 02:58:55.724
OTHERS.

02:58:55.791 --> 02:58:58.060
BECAUSE WE WE FIND SOME OF THE

02:58:58.127 --> 02:58:59.095
SEXY STUFF SO INTERESTING OFF

02:58:59.161 --> 02:59:00.863

THE LOCAL AGENCIES ARE FINDING

02:59:03.899 --> 02:59:05.401
IT INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO

02:59:05.468 --> 02:59:07.536
EVEN APPLY FOR SOME OF THE FUNDS

02:59:07.603 --> 02:59:08.904
THAT ARE OUT THERE.

02:59:08.971 --> 02:59:10.339
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE

02:59:10.406 --> 02:59:13.409
RESOURCES TO TO BE ABLE TO APPLY

02:59:13.476 --> 02:59:14.710
TO DO THE PLANNING.

02:59:14.777 --> 02:59:17.413

02:59:17.480 --> 02:59:18.514
SURE THAT THINGS ARE SHOVEL

02:59:18.581 --> 02:59:19.148
READY BECAUSE THAT SUFFICIENT

02:59:19.215 --> 02:59:22.084
THAT'S EFFECTIVE BUT HOW DO WE

02:59:22.151 --> 02:59:22.718

02:59:22.785 --> 02:59:22.952
READY.

02:59:23.018 --> 02:59:24.086
WITHOUT THE PLANNING.

02:59:24.153 --> 02:59:25.688

02:59:25.754 --> 02:59:26.922
WHERE WE'RE GOING TO BE IF WE

02:59:26.989 --> 02:59:27.823

ENSURE THAT WE HAVE PUT THE

02:59:31.594 --> 02:59:33.329
RIGHT PROGRAMS IN PLACE WITHOUT

02:59:33.395 --> 02:59:35.164
THAT PLANNING AND THEN YOU'RE

02:59:35.231 --> 02:59:35.731
RIGHT WITHOUT THE MONITORING

02:59:35.798 --> 02:59:37.299

THE WITHOUT THE MONITORING AND

02:59:47.042 --> 02:59:48.210
WAR WITH THE NEXT PROJECT SHOULD

02:59:48.277 --> 02:59:49.778

I'M JUST FOCUSING TODAY A LITTLE

03:13:03.305 --> 03:13:03.872
BIT ON SOMETHING I THINK CENTER

03:13:03.939 --> 03:13:05.540
KIND OF LOW HANGING FRUIT THAT

03:13:05.607 --> 03:13:07.742
MIGHT HELP ON THE DEMO GAS IT

03:13:07.809 --> 03:13:08.843
SITUATION.

03:13:08.910 --> 03:13:11.212
I'VE SEEN LITTLE BABY SEA LIONS

03:13:11.279 --> 03:13:13.114

03:13:13.181 --> 03:13:14.416
YOU CAN'T UNSEE.

03:13:14.482 --> 03:13:16.618
AND I KNOW IT IF THE LG IS

03:13:16.685 --> 03:13:18.787
AFFECTING THE CRABS AND SO I

03:13:18.853 --> 03:13:20.255
THOUGHT THE LOW HANGING FRUIT MY

03:13:20.322 --> 03:13:23.692
FEET THAT WE FIGURE OUT WHAT TO

03:13:23.758 --> 03:13:25.994
DO ABOUT SOMEONE [inaudible]

03:13:26.061 --> 03:13:30.665
THE PHOSPHORUS AMMONIA AS AND

03:13:30.732 --> 03:13:34.369
THE WHAT'S THE OTHER.

03:13:34.436 --> 03:13:35.470
ONE US HERE IS --

03:13:35.537 --> 03:13:38.239
MANANA AND NITROGEN --

03:13:38.306 --> 03:13:40.175
AND THAT IS JUST FLOWING DOWN

03:13:40.241 --> 03:13:41.943
OUR CREEKS INTO RIVERS AND IT'S

03:13:42.010 --> 03:13:43.812
GOING IN THE OCEAN AND THAT

03:13:43.878 --> 03:13:44.879
CREATES ALGAE BLOOMS IS

03:13:44.946 --> 03:13:46.014
SOMETHING.

03:13:46.081 --> 03:13:47.315
WE CAN CONTROL WE CAN THIS

03:13:47.382 --> 03:13:48.483
REALLY CONTROL CLIMATE CHANGE

03:13:48.550 --> 03:13:50.151
TOMORROW BUT WE CAN CONTROL WHAT

03:13:50.218 --> 03:13:51.586
GOES INTO OUR STREAMS.

03:13:51.653 --> 03:13:54.189
WHICH IS HARMING OUR FISHERIES.

03:13:54.255 --> 03:13:56.291
AND OF COURSE IT'S CREATING YOU

03:13:56.358 --> 03:13:58.893
KNOW HYPOXIC AREAS THAT CREATE

03:13:58.960 --> 03:14:01.262
WHICH THE OXYGEN OUT OF THE

03:14:01.329 --> 03:14:05.333
WATER AND THEN YOU HAVE --

03:14:05.400 --> 03:14:07.102
HE FISH GOING FURTHER OUT TO SEA

03:14:07.168 --> 03:14:09.404
TO GET OXYGEN AND FOOD AND THAT

03:14:09.471 --> 03:14:10.672
RESULTS IN SOME BABY SEA LIONS

03:14:10.739 --> 03:14:11.339
STARVING.

03:14:11.406 --> 03:14:12.774
SO IT'S ALL CONNECTED SO I MY

03:14:12.841 --> 03:14:14.743
SOLUTION WOULD BE YOU KNOW

03:14:14.809 --> 03:14:16.177
ENCOURAGE REGIONAL BOARDS AND

03:14:16.244 --> 03:14:17.345
FISH AND WILDLIFE.

03:14:17.412 --> 03:14:20.048
FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN STOP SOME

03:14:20.115 --> 03:14:21.950
OF THE SEDIMENTATION --

03:14:22.017 --> 03:14:23.818
THAT SEEMS TO BE A IS SOMETHING

03:14:23.885 --> 03:14:24.919
THAT THIS IS OUR DUTY AND

03:14:24.986 --> 03:14:27.022
RESPONSIBILITY ALREADY SO IT'S

03:14:27.088 --> 03:14:27.822
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY.

03:14:27.889 --> 03:14:29.524
THE I. CLIMATE CHANGE AND WE

03:14:29.591 --> 03:14:32.527
NEED TO DO BETTER ON OUR RUN OFF

03:14:32.594 --> 03:14:34.929
ISSUES -- I

03:14:34.996 --> 03:14:36.631
THINK THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE

03:14:36.698 --> 03:14:39.100
CALIFORNIA WE HAVE HIGH QUALITY --

03:14:39.167 --> 03:14:40.502
INDUSTRIES AND FISH AND W

03:14:40.568 --> 03:14:42.170
SHOULD MARKET IT AT A HIGHER

03:14:42.237 --> 03:14:44.005
PRICE WE WOULD HAVE TO HARVEST

03:14:44.072 --> 03:14:44.839
AS MUCH.

03:14:44.906 --> 03:14:46.107
FISHERMEN COULD MAKE A LIVING

03:14:46.174 --> 03:14:47.776
AND WE COULD LEAVE MORE FISH IN

03:14:47.842 --> 03:14:49.310
THE OCEAN I THINK THAT'S IT AND

03:14:49.377 --> 03:14:52.113
THE SUPERBOWL GOAL IS TO SAY WE

03:14:52.180 --> 03:14:55.650
HAVE THE BEST FISH AND THAT WAY.

03:14:55.717 --> 03:14:59.387
EVERYBODY CAN SURVIVE AND MIGHT

03:14:59.454 --> 03:15:00.989
BE AN INTERESTING MARKETING

03:15:01.056 --> 03:15:03.858
APPROACH --

03:15:03.925 --> 03:15:05.894
I DON'T REALLY I'M NOT TOO

03:15:05.960 --> 03:15:07.262
EXCITED ABOUT HEARING THAT WE'RE

03:15:07.328 --> 03:15:08.830
GOING FOR INSULATED INCIDENTAL

03:15:08.897 --> 03:15:11.499
TAKE PERMIT. TO TAKE WHALES

03:15:11.566 --> 03:15:13.735
BECAUSE OF ENTANGLEMENTS --

03:15:13.802 --> 03:15:15.770
INCIDENTAL TAKE PERMIT MEANS

03:15:15.837 --> 03:15:17.472
IT'S OKAY TAKE.

03:15:17.539 --> 03:15:19.441
SPECIES AND I WOULD NOT

03:15:19.507 --> 03:15:20.975
