THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND GOOD AFTERNOON SENATORS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT SENATE BILL. TWO FORTY NINE. THE INTELLECTUAL DIVERSITY ACT WHICH SEEKS TO ADDRESS DISCRIMINATION BASED UPON POLITICAL AFFILIATION AT OUR SCHOOLS. WRITER STUDENTS WITH EXPOSURE TO ALL IDEAS AND PERSPECTIVES IT'S A CENTURY THAT SHOULD BE CELEBRATED AND ENCOURAGED INSTEAD WE ARE SEEING PROFESSORS AND TEACHERS DO THE OPPOSITE. JUST THE OTHER DAY IT WAS REPORTED TO SAN DIEGO TEACHER WAS HEARD A RESUME THE RATING IS STUDENTS PARENTS OVER THEIR DISPLEASURE OF HYBRID LEARNING IN FAVOR OF FULL IN PERSON LEARNING THE PARENT WHO EXPOSE THIS TEACHER WAS QUOTED AS SAYING. BY HELD ON TO THAT VIDEO FOR THREE MONTHS AND HARDLY TOLD A SOUL FEARING RETALIATION. CALIFORNIA'S EDUCATION CODE PROTECTS VARIOUS CHARACTERISTICS FROM BULLYING SUCH AS RELIGION AND ETHNICITY BUT DOES NOT INCLUDE ONE POLITICAL VIEW POINTS OR AFFILIATIONS. IF WE ARE GOING TO ALLOW SIXTEEN YEAR OLDS TO PRE REGISTER TO VOTE WHILE IN HIGH SCHOOL THEY SHOULD BE FREE OF BULLYING FROM THEIR TEACHERS AND FELLOW STUDENTS REGARDING THEIR POLITICAL VIEWPOINTS. THIS INFLUENCE THE NEGATIVITY IS MORE VISIBLE ON OUR COLLEGE CAMPUSES IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN HARVARD STUDENTS TRIED TO PREVENT ANY TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS FROM APPEARING AS SPEAKERS ON CAMPUS EVEN AS SEVEN UNITED STATES PRESIDENTS HAVE CALLED HER PERVERTED SILVA MATER INCLUDING PRESIDENTS OBAMA. GEORGE W. BUSH AND JOHN F. KENNEDY THE TWENTY TWENTY YET ANOTHER PETITION BY HARVARD STUDENTS ATTEMPTED TO HAVE THE EDUCATIONAL DEGREES OF TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS REVOKED. THE CAN THESE PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS DO THESE SORTS OF THINGS YES THEY CAN BUT SHOULD WE BE ENCOURAGING IT FOR TURNING A BLIND EYE TO IT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. NO WE SHOULD NOT. ANOTHER EXAM THE MISSION STATEMENT FROM UCLA INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING. TO FULFILL THIS MISSION UCLA'S COMMITTED TO ACADEMIC FREEDOM AND ITS FULLEST TERMS WE VALUE OPEN ACCESS TO FREEDOM FREE AND LIVELY DEBATE CONDUCTED WITH MUTUAL RESPECT FOR INDIVIDUALS AND FREEDOM FROM INTOLERANCE IN ALL OUR PURSUITS WE STRIVE AT ONCE FOR EXCELLENCE IN DIVERSITY RECOGNIZING THAT OPENNESS AND INCLUSION PRODUCE TRUE EQUALITY. CALIFORNIA IS NOT THE ONLY STATE TO CONFRONT THIS GROWING PROBLEM ON FRIDAY GET MONTANA GOVERNOR GREG GIANFORTE'S SIGNED TWO BILLS THAT AIM TO PROTECT FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND ASSOCIATION ON PUBLIC UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES IN THE STATE. IT PROHIBITS UNIVERSITIES FROM DENYING RESOURCES TO RELIGIOUS POLITICAL OR IDEOLOGICAL STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS EVEN IF THEY HOLD VIEWS THAT OTHER STUDENTS MAY FIND OFFENSIVE. NORTH TO COUNT TO KOTA HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES PASSED A BILL PROHIBITING ACTIVITY CENTER MELINDA'S YES I WOULDN'T ORDINARILY DO THIS BUT BECAUSE WE HAVE FOLKS LINED UP ON THE PHONE ON YOUR BILL- I BELIEVE SB TWO THIRTY EIGHT IS THE FIRST BILL I'M SORRY STARTED WITH MY SECOND ONE IT PEOPLE ARE LINED UP TO TESTIFY. SO JUST SO WE- BASICALLY DON'T GET FOLKS. CONFUSE MY POLICY IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND GOING BACK TO S. B. TWO THIRTY EIGHT SURE OKAY MY APOLOGIES I THOUGHT WE ARE STARTING TO FORTY NINE IRATE. OKAY S. B. TWO THIRTY EIGHT. MISTER CHAIRMAN SENATORS I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT SENATE BILL TWO THIRTY EIGHT THE DIVERSITY OF THOUGHT ACT WHICH SEEKS TO REMEDY THE GROWING TREND OF CANCEL CULTURE IN OUR SOCIETY SOCIETY TODAY. THE FOUNDERS OF OUR CONSTITUTION ENSURING THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION TO ROOT OUT AND PREVENT TYRANNY THEY DID THIS TO ENSURE A POWERFUL MONARCH COULD NOT STIFLE THEIR BORDERS THEIR VOICES OR INSTRUCTOR LEGISLATURE TO DO SO FOR THEM. WHEN WE SAW THE ATTACKS AGAINST ONE SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR GENDER IDENTITY AS CALIFORNIANS WE ADDED THEM TO THE ANTI DISCRIMINATION LAWS WHEN WE SAW ATTACKS AGAINST ONE'S ETHNICITY ONE TO MARITAL STATUS OR RELIGION WE ADDED THEM TO CALIFORNIA'S ANTI DISCRIMINATION LAWS. NOW IT'S OUR THOUGHTS IN BELIEF SYSTEMS THAT ARE FACING CENSORSHIP CANCELLATION AND ATTACKED AND IT IS TIME TO PROTECT THEM. IN TODAY'S SOCIETY WE HAVE LOST OUR ABILITY TO AGREE TO DISAGREE. WE HAVE LOST OUR ABILITY TO LISTEN TO THE VIEWPOINTS OF OTHERS TO BE CIVIL AND UNDERSTANDING IN THAT AGREEMENT. WE'VE TURNED TO TRIBALISM AND MOB ADVOCACY INSTEAD SHAMING PEOPLE INTO JOINING ONE VIEWPOINT SACRIFICING THEIR OWN JUST TO AVOID SCRUTINY OR BACKLASH. TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE RECENT FIRING AT GINA CARANO FROM DISNEY'S THE MANDALORIAN WHO WAS FIRED FOR EXPRESSING HER OPINIONS ON SOCIAL MEDIA HER OPINIONS APPARENTLY DID NOT ALIGN WITH DISNEY'S. BECAUSE POLITICALLY CHARGED POSTED BY HER CO STAR IN OTHER DISNEY ACTORS AND ACTRESSES WERE NOT MET WITH THE SAME REACTION OR RESULT. THE EXAMPLES OF THIS TYPE OF DOUBLE STANDARD IN POLITICAL CORRECTNESS DISCRIMINATION HAVE BEEN LAID BARE FOR US FOR US ALL TO SEE. ENTIRE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OFFLINE BY AMAZON WEB SERVICES ALL STAR GAMES HAVE BEEN MOVED AND SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS FROM A DECADE AGO CAN COME BACK. AND RUIN A PERSON'S CAREER. AS LEGISLATORS WE ARE CHARGED TO REPRESENT ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS NOT JUST THE ONES WITH WHOM WE AGREE. SB TWO THIRTY EIGHT MAKES IT CLEAR THAT WE AS AN ELECTED BODY IN THE STATE. TELL YOU THE OPINIONS OF OTHERS EVEN THOUGH WE MAY NOT AGREE WITH THEM AND ENSURES THAT POLITICAL AFFILIATION IS NOT USED AS A DISQUALIFIER FOR JOB. WHETHER THAT JOBS AT A STARBUCKS FOR CRITICAL IT OR DISNEYLAND. IT ALSO ENSURES THAT EMPLOYEES WITH NOTORIETY LIKE AMANDA I AM SEEING WHO LOST HER JOB WITH THE MAKE UP COMPANY SEPHORA PROPOSED IN SOCIAL MEDIA. AND THE AVERAGE CALIFORNIAN CAN HAVE THEIR PERSONAL VOICE WITHOUT BEING SHAMED OR WITHOUT FEAR OF RETALIATION BECAUSE IT MAY DIFFER FROM THEIR EMPLOYER. THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS TO PROTECT THE PERSONAL IDEAS AND BELIEFS WE EACH HAVE FROM BEING USED AS A LITMUS TEST BEFORE RECEIVING A JOB OFFER. IN A COUNTRY THAT PRIDES ITSELF ON THE FREE EXCHANGE OF IDEAS AND EXPRESSION. IT IS CONCERNING THAT POLITICAL LEADERS CORPORATIONS AND SOCIAL MEDIA GIANTS WOULD SEEK TO SILENCE THAT OPPRESSION. SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY DON'T AGREE WITH IT OR THEY DON'T LIKE IT. THE FIRST AMENDMENT GRANTS THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY COUNTRY IN AN A LEVEL RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH AND ASSOCIATION. THIS RATE WILL BE RAISED IF WE ALLOW THE CURRENT PRACTICE OF DISCRIMINATION ON POLITICAL BELIEFS TO CONTINUE. SEVEN SB TWO THIRTY EIGHT WILL ACCOMPLISH THREE THINGS FIRST IT WILL ADD POLITICAL AFFILIATION TO THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT. TO PREVENT EMPLOYERS AND LANDLORDS FROM DISCRIMINATING AGAINST JOB CANDIDATES AND THOSE SEEKING HOUSING BECAUSE OF THEIR POLITICAL AFFILIATION. SECOND IT ADDS POLITICAL AFFILIATION OR POLITICAL BELIEVED TO THE UNRUH CIVIL RIGHTS ACT. AND LASTLY THAT'S POLITICAL AFFILIATION TO SECTIONAL REVENUE TO THE CALIFORNIA LABOR CODE THE PROTECTION PLOY PERMANENTLY ANY ADVERSE ACTION TAKEN AGAINST EMPLOYEE FOR POLITICAL ACTIVITIES. MANY OF YOU MAY NOT AGREE OR BELIEVE THE CANCEL CULTURE OR DISCRIMINATION BASED UPON POLITICAL BELIEFS EXIST OR THAT IT IS A PROBLEM BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT IT DOES EXIST AND IT IS A VERY REAL PROBLEM FOR MY CONSTITUENTS IN FOR MANY OF YOURS. TODAY I HAVE MISTER STEVE COMBOS WHO'S A TEACHER FROM RIVERSIDE COUNTY A CONSTITUENT OF MINE MY DISTRICT WHO WILL BE TESTIFYING VIA TELECONFERENCE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU SIR MELINDA'S MISTER COMPOST ARE YOU AVAILABLE. SO WHILE WE'RE LOOKING FOR MISTER KOPPEL'S JUST FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE WAITING ON THE PHONE LINES- THIS IS S. B. TWO THIRTY EIGHT MELENDEZ NEXT BILL SB TWO FORTY NINE WILL BE PRESENTED AFTER THIS BILL. OF THEN SENATOR NEWMAN WILL BE- PRESENTING ON S. B. SIX SIXTY. ALL RIGHT A MISTER MODERATOR MARYLAND THAT DO WE HAVE MISTER KUMBLE'S. YES MISTER COMPOSTABLE HEAD. MANY MISTY COMPASS AND I'VE BEEN TEACHING FOR TWENTY THREE YEARS. THE PROBLEM EDUCATION THESE DAYS IS THAT FOR MANY EDUCATED AND IS THAT MANY EDUCATORS ARE WORKING IN A HOSTILE WORKPLACE ENVIRONMENT. AN EXAMPLE OUR SCHOOL BOARD HAS DETERMINED THAT BLM IS NOT A POLITICAL ORGANIZATION. THAT MEANS WEARING TO BLM SURE HAVING A D. L. BLM AS YOUR VIRTUAL BACKGROUND IS OKAY IT IS ALWAYS A BLUE LINE FLAG WILL SUPPORT OF LONG COURSE AND SOMEHOW. THEY ARE RACIST. I HAVE BEEN HARASSED DISCRIMINATED AGAINST AT THE SITE IN ADMINISTRATIVE LEVEL AT LEAST THREE TIMES. WHAT IF YOU COLLEAGUES AND I HAD DISCOVERED THAT THERE WERE SOME INSIGHT INTO MINISTRY TO ACCOUNTABILITY ISSUES ALONG WITH THE MISAPPROPRIATION OF FUNDS. WE TRIED TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT HOLDING PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE COMES AT THE PRICE TO PAY. YOU TRY TO RESOLVE ACCOUNTABILITY ISSUES VIA THE COMMUNICATION PROCESS THINGS RARELY CHANGER GET DONE. WHERE DO THEY TAKE YOUR ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS. AN ISSUE SERIOUSLY. THIS WILL LEAD YOU TO FILE GRIEVANCES INFORMAL COMPLAINTS CONCERNS AND LEADERSHIP POSITIONS WHEN YOU DO THIS WE FOUND OUT THE HARD WAY. THEY NEVER FORGET AND DO NOT APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT NOW THE SITUATION IS ALREADY. AFTER FOUND A SUBSTANTIATED COMPLAINT. LABELED AS BEING A TROUBLEMAKER EVEN THOUGH YOU WERE JUST MAKING SURE THAT IT COVERS BOTH POLITICS AND THAT YOUR SITE WILL BEING CMPLIANT WITH SPECIAL ALLOCATION OF FUNDS. BECAUSE THEY FOUND THE FORMAL COMPLAINT WHENEVER I TRY TO TRANSFER OUT OF THE OUT OF THE SITE WHERE I WAS BEING HARASSED THESE DIFFICULT FOR ANOTHER SITE. WITHIN THE DISTRICT WHERE THEY WOULD HIRE ME I INTERVIEWED FOR SEVERAL OPPORTUNITIES THAT WERE AVAILABLE AND DID NOT GET THE POSITIONS. OF MY OTHER COLLEAGUES WOULD INTERVIEW FOR POSITIONS IN WHICH THEY HAD PROPER CREDENTIALS OR EXPERIENCE MET ALL THE JOB REQUIREMENTS AND YET THEY WERE NEVER HIRED. THEY ALSO DID NOT HAVE ANY COMPLAINTS IN THEIR PROFESSIONAL PILOTS. WE HAVE SEEN PEOPLE WITH NO EXPERIENCE PLUS EXPERIENCE UNTIL WE DO NOT EVEN HAVE THE APPROPRIATE CREDENTIALS NECESSARY FOR THE. JOB GET HIRED. OVER THEM. YOU REPRESENTATIVES ALSO. ISSUES TIMES. BECAUSE THAT CAN ALSO YOU TO BE. UNFAIRLY GENERAL WE ARE SO TO BE IT. MORE WITHIN THE LEFT WING INTO TO OF PUBLIC AT. SOMETIMES WE'RE BEING. UNFAIRLY BECAUSE OF OUR POLITICAL AFFILIATION. ARE CONSERVATIVE VOICES NOT ONLY BEING SILENCED WE ARE DELIGHTED SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS FOR HAVING A DIFFERENT OPINION. OR DIVERSITY OF SPOT. THAT DOES NOT ALIGN WITH THE PROGRESSIVE POLITICAL AGENDA THAT HAS INFILTRATED PUBLIC EDUCATION. COMMISSION BECAUSE IT WILL CANCEL ABOUT COMPUTER THE DEPLETION POSITIONS. AND OPPORTUNITIES JUST BECAUSE WE THINK THAT EDUCATION SHOULD BE ABOUT EDUCATIONAL ISSUES. LIKE LOW MATH AND LITERACY SCORES. INSTEAD OF THE POLITICALLY CHARGED JUST THE GENDER. WITHIN THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM. I TESTIFYING TODAY AT THIS HEARING CAN PUT ME AT RISK OF DOORS BEING CLOSED TO FUTURE LEADERSHIP POSITIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES. WITHIN THE INSTITUTION OF PUBLIC EDUCATION. BUT I THINK IT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAT I SHARE MY EXPERIENCE BECAUSE OF. THE EXPERIENCE OF THOUSANDS OF EDUCATORS. MANY EDUCATORS ARE SILENCE AND FEAR VERBALLY SHARING THEIR THOUGHTS. ON PUBLIC EDUCATION BECAUSE OF THEIR POLITICAL. AFFILIATION INCLUDING URGING TO SUPPORT SENATE BILL TWO THIRTY EIGHT. THANKS AGAIN FOR ALLOWING ME TO SHARE MY EXPERIENCE TODAY AND TAKING THE TIME TO HEAR MY STORY. AND CONSIDER MUCH PART POSITION.

ALL RIGHT OTHER CALLERS MISTER MODERATOR. WE HAVE NO OTHER THANK YOU AT THIS TIME ALL RIGHT SO WE'RE GONNA BRING IT BACK TO THE CHAMBER NOW- I SEE CENTER BOARDS HAS MICROPHONE UP CENTER BORDERS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I WANT TO COMMEND THE- THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH I THINK. THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT PROVISIONS WITHIN OUR- STATUTORY AUTHORITY. I REALLY APPRECIATE TAKING A GANDER. THAT THE ALLEGED COUNSEL'S OPINION ON THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT. SOMETHING THAT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION. WAS THE CONCLUSION SAID IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR IF I COULD READ FROM THE REPORT ONE SENTENCE SURE GO AHEAD. IT IS OUR OPINION THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF A LEGITIMATE BUSINESS INTEREST JUSTIFYING A DISTINCTION. ON THE BASIS OF POLITICAL BELIEF OR AFFILIATION THE OWNER CIVIL RIGHTS ACT PROHIBITS DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF POLITICAL BELIEFS OR AFFILIATIONS. SO I HAVE A KIND OF ZONE IN ON THE ABSENCE OF A LEGITIMATE BUSINESS INTEREST. SO I DO BELIEVE THAT. THERE HAVE BEEN FOLKS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM THAT HAVE BEEN DISCRIMINATED AGAINST- I DON'T NECESSARILY FIND AT THAT ONE PARTY HAS A SUPERIOR POSITION OVER THE OTHER WHETHER BEYOND THE LEFT CENTER OR THE RIGHT. I JUST KNOW THAT. IT DEFIES LOGIC IT DEFIES WHAT WE DEEM TO BE OUR FIRST AMENDMENT. CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS OF ASSOCIATING OF BEING PART OF AN ASSEMBLY AND EXPRESSING THOSE SO LONG AS IT'S NOT. HI INTERFERING WITH THE WORK PLACE- BEEN IT SHOULD HAVE NO BEARING ON AN INDIVIDUAL'S CAPACITY TO BE EMPLOYED OR TO BE HOUSED- IT CETERA. BUT THAT CONCLUSION IF I MAY. OFFER A REQUEST TO THE AUTHOR THROUGH THE CHAIR. IS THAT A LEGITIMATE BUSINESS INTERESTS JUSTIFYING A DISTINCTION IS AN INTERESTING CHOICE OF WORDS THAT LEDGE COUNCIL IS OFFERING. SO THE QUESTION IS. IT DISNEY FOR AMAZON OR ANY OTHER MAJOR- EMPLOYER FORTY INDUSTRY- ENTITY. CALCULATES OUT THAT IT WOULD HURT THEIR BUSINESS INTEREST BY ALLOWING EMPLOYEES WHO MAY BE AFFILIATED WITH ONE POLITICAL FACTION OR PARTY. IS IT YOUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT GIVES RISE TO AN ALLOWANCE. M. NO IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU STILL HAVE YOUR SOUL OF AFFORDED THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES AS YOU WOULD ANY OTHER TIME WITH RESPECT TO HIRING AN EMPLOYEE THIS IS. IT IT'S DECLARATIVE OF THE UNRUH CIVIL RIGHTS ACT AGE AS YOU SO APTLY POINTED OUT. BUT IT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY THE ABILITY FOR EMPLOYER TO METE OUT WHO MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS AND WHO- WOULD YOU KNOW BE BEST SERVED IN THAT POSITION I WILL- TO DIVE A LITTLE DEEPER INTO THE LEGAL DETAILS- MORGAN BRANCH. IS HERE IF YOU WANTED TO ADD TO THAT- HE'S HERE FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANT ASSISTANCE MORGAN IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD TO THAT. IT IT'S NOT NECESSARY WAS AN INTELLECTUAL CURIOSITY OKAY I THINK BECAUSE WE'VE HEARD THESE THAT WE'VE HEARD THESE DISCUSSIONS ARE POSITIONS. MADE BY. MAJOR INDUSTRIES YOU KNOW COCA COLA OR WHATEVER THAT. THERE WERE EIGHT DEARER THEY COULD BE ARGUING THAT THEY DO NOT WANT TO EMPLOY INDIVIDUALS THAT MAY BE AFFILIATED WITH THE POLITICAL INTEREST GROUP OR POLITICAL PARTY BECAUSE IT MAY HURT THEIR BOTTOM LINE FINANCIALLY IT IS THAT JUSTIFICATION. THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE LEGAL OPINION I SEE WELL YOU KNOW AGAIN IT'S LIKE ANY OTHER EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY IF I MEAN YOU COULD- IT WOULD BE A ONE POLITICAL AFFILIATION AND SHE USED TO WORK FOR A COMPANY THAT HAS AN OPPOSING VIEWPOINT AS LONG AS YOU'RE ABLE TO DO THAT JOB AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY WISH. YOU TO DO THAT JOB AND DON'T LET YOUR OWN POLITICAL YOU KNOW IDEOLOGY GET IN THE WAY THEN THERE'S NO REASON FOR THEM TO DENY YOU THE OPPORTUNITY FOR WORKING TO WHEN IT STARTS TO BECOME A FUNCTION OF YOUR- IS WHERE THE- IS EXACTLY AND I WANT TO GET I WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR THAT EVEN THOUGH I THINK. THERE ARE. ENOUGH PROTECTIONS FOR THIS TYPE PULL BELIEF OR AFFILIATION BILL. IT'S HELPFUL WHEN WE OPENLY DECLARE THROUGH LEGISLATION THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE INTEND TO DO. IS TO DISALLOW DISCRIMINATION BASED ON AFFILIATION. BECAUSE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. MIGHT HAVE PROCLIVITIES GOING ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. AND THAT'S JUST NOT WHAT AMERICA IS ABOUT. FREE MARKET PLACE OF I. IS WHAT WE ARE ABOUT AS LONG AS IT DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH THE WORK PLACE. DIRECTLY THEN I THINK THOSE INDIVIDUAL SHOULD HAVE THAT FREEDOM. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. THANK YOU CENTER BOARD JUST- CENTER GONZALEZ IS YOUR MICROPHONE UP. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- SO JUST HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS- I ACTUALLY LOOKING TO THE ANALYSIS AS WELL AND I DO AGREE WITH- THE CHIEF CONSULTANT AS SHE HAD MENTIONED IN HERE THAT WOULD BE FORCING BUSINESSES AND EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE WORKPLACE IS TO TOLERATE STRONG OPPOSING VIEWS AND POTENTIALLY HATE SPEECH I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THAT FIRST AND FOREMOST IF I CAN POSE THAT QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR. AND THEN THE SECOND IS. I HAVEN'T SEEN IN HERE AND PERHAPS I'VE MISSED IT WHAT IS POLITICAL AFFILIATION. WHAT IS DETERMINED BY THAT IS THAT A POLITICAL AFFILIATION WITH THE SPECIFIC. POLITICAL LIKE DEMOCRAT REPUBLICAN INDEPENDENT OR IS IT JUST ANYONE BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME GROUPS THAT AFFILIATE POLITICALLY BUT THEY'RE NOT. ASSOCIATED WITH ANY PARTICULAR. GROUP IN THAT IN THAT SENSE. MISTER CHAIR FOR ME SURE SUDDENLINK YOU SO MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CENTER GONZALEZ- SO WITH RESPECT TO- PROVIDING A DEFINITION OF POLITICAL BELIEF OR POLITICAL AFFILIATION- IT YOU NOW WE MY STAFF HAS OFFERED TO WORK WITH THE- COMMITTEE TO BETTER DEFINE THESE TERMS SEVERAL TIMES ACTUALLY AND THAT REQUEST WAS DENIED TO ITS OWN IS THAT WE DIDN'T TRY. TO DO THAT BUT THERE WAS NO INTEREST- IN WORKING TO FURTHER DEFINE THAT- I WILL SAY THOUGH THAT THE ABSENCE OF A DEFINITION I DON'T THINK- IS FATAL FOR THIS BILL BECAUSE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF TERMS JUST WITHIN THE UIVERSE OF A RIGHTS ACT BETTER UNDEFINED- WHICH INCLUDE RACE COLOR ANCESTRY. MARITAL STATUS CITIZENSHIP PRIMARY LANGUAGE IMMIGRATION STATUS NATIONAL ORIGIN ACCOMMODATIONS I MEAN THERE'S A WHOLE HOST OF TERMS THAT ARE UNDEFINED AND YET WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO APPLY THE LAW EQUALLY WITHOUT YOU KNOW IT I AM VERY SPECIFIC DEFINITION WITH WHICH TO DO SO- SO I JUST WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT I KNOW THAT THE ANALYSIS DID. SPEAK TO YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT IS. THIS- BUT AGAIN. THERE'S A NUMBER OF CALIFORNIA CODES THAT YOU KNOW LACK- AND DEFINITION AND YET WE'RE STILL ABLE TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS. THANK YOU- SENATE WHITE HOUSE GIVE A QUESTION BUT% YES THIRDS I DID READ THE REPORT- BUT LET'S CANCEL AND- CONCLUDING THAT IT IT APPEARS AS THOUGH. THE POLITICAL BELIEFS WOULD BE PROTECTED THE- IT BROUGHT TWO KEYS. THE ANALYSIS BEFORE AS PART. REESE'S MANY CONCERNS ABOUT FROM A POLICY- THE POINT BEGINNING ON PAGE EIGHT OF WHETHER YOU KNOW WORKED IT IS INVOLVED PARTISAN- PERFECT. BUT POLITICAL PARTISAN WORK WHETHER- THE EMPLOYER WOULD HAVE TO DISCRETION TO- CHIU SOMEBODY THAT THEY THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE WOULD BE ON THEIR TEAM IF THEY FOR THEY THEY FIT INTO THEIR THEIR WORK OR IS IT IS IT ACTUALLY NECESSARY TO GO THROUGH A VARIETY OF. SCENARIOS WERE. THE MOTHERS AGAINST SOMEBODY COMES IN WITH TEACHERS WITH MOTHERS AGAINST DRUNK DRIVING AND GO VEGAN AND THEY'RE PLAYING FOR A BARBECUE WHISKEY BAR- OPPORTUNITY- EMPLOYMENT YOU'VE GOT- PEOPLE WORRIED ABOUT OR THIS IDEA THAT WE'RE TURNING THE WORKPLACE. INTO THE TOWN SQUARE WHERE PEOPLE CAN COME IN AND HAVE TO DISCUSSIONS TO TALK ABOUT SANDY HOOK IN A GUN SHOP THAT WOULD BE DISRUPTIVE TO THE BUSINESS- TO. THROUGH THOSE POINTS THAT WERE RAISED IN THE ANALYSIS WORK WITH THE AUTHOR'S RESPONSE BILL GIVEN THAT IT APPEARS THAT THE TERRORISTS TESTS ALREADY PROTECTS A TRULY AGREE EACH PERSON. FOR THEIR HOLDING THEIR POLITICAL BELIEFS. VEGAS ANYWAY KASKY CYLINDERS OKAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN SENATOR WHITE HOUSE GATE. ARE THERE IS A LOT TO UNPACK. SO WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO START WITH BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS EACH OF YOUR CONCERNS. OF THE WORK THE- FIFTY. EMPLOYERS SONORA CASKEY- IN YOUR MIND. THIS IS START WITH THE WITH THE WORK SITE THE EMPLOYER HAVING TO ACCOMMODATE DISCUSSIONS OTHER PEOPLE IN THERE AND THEN GO TO HIRING THOSE PEOPLE- THAT MIGHT NOT FIT IN OR MIGHT BE DESTRUCTIVE TO THE WORK ENVIRONMENT. OKAY SO YOUR FORGIVE ME BUT YOUR SPECIFIC CONCERN ABOUT DISCUSSIONS IN THE WORK PLACE CENTERS AROUND. WHAT I JUST I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CONCERN IS THAT ARE YOU CONCERNED THAT- I EMPLOYER COULDN'T. HAVE ANY CONTROL OVER CONVERSATIONS AT WORK. I MEAN MISTER CHAIR BUT IT'S A WHITE CAL THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THAT YOU COULDN'T DISCRIMINATE AGAINST SOMEBODY'S POLITICAL PULL- OUR POLITICAL BELIEFS AND HIRING THEM YOU WOULD HE WOULD BE FORCED TO HIRE SOMEBODY THAT LET'S SEE IS A VEGAN AND IS A MOTHER AGAINST DRUNK DRIVING AND SHE SHE'S COMING INTO YOUR BARBECUE WHISKEY SHIP WHICH AND SHE'S CONFRONTATIONAL SAYING I NEED THIS JOB YOU CANNOT. USE MY POLITICAL BELIEFS TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST ME TO GIVE ME THIS JOB SURE IN IN A SITUATION LIKE THAT IF SOMEONE WERE TO COME IN AND SAY I WANT THIS JOB AND I NEED THIS JOB AND IF YOU DON'T GIVE IT TO ME IT'S GOING TO BE BECAUSE OF MY POLITICAL AFFILIATIONS- I WOULD IMAGINE THAT AT PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYER WOULD FIND A WHOLE HOST OF REASONS NOT TO HIRE THAT PERSON BASED ON. THE PERSONALITY WITH WHICH THEY HOPPED INTO THE INTERVIEW WITH THE MEAN AN INTERVIEW IT'S NOT JUST BASED ON THE THINGS ON YOUR RESUME NOT JUST ON YOUR SPECIFIC SKILL SET A QUALIFICATION IT'S BASED ON A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE HOW YOU KNOW YOUR YOUR DEMEANOR WITHIN THE INTERVIEW HOW AN EMPLOYER MIGHT THINK YOU WOULD INTERACT WITH THE REST OF THE EMPLOYEES I MEAN THERE'S A WHOLE HOST OF THINGS IT'S NOT JUST BASED ON THE FACT THAT SOMEBODY. HAS A T. SHIRT ON THAT SAYS THERE BEGIN AND BY THE WAY BEING A VEGAN OR ANYTHING ELSE IS NOT A POLITICAL AFFILIATION SO. I DON'T THINK THAT THAT COMES INTO THE CONVERSATION. THANK YOU SO. SKI BUT I THINK MAYBE TO PUT A FINER POINT ON YOUR QUESTION SO I CAN ASK IF I COULD POSE A QUESTION SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU ARE IN LEADERSHIP OF A PRO LIFE ORGANIZATION SOMEONE COMES IN THE INTERVIEW THEY HAVE ALL THE QUALIFICATIONS YOU EXTEND AN OFFER. AND THEN THEY SAY I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ACCEPT THIS OFFER BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW ON IBM VICE PRESIDENT OF NAY ROUTE. WITH THAT AT THAT POINT IN TIME. IS IT YOUR VIEW THAT THAT IF THAT PERSON SHOULD BE HIRED BY THE PRO LIFE ORGANIZATION WOULD THEY HAVE A CAUSE OF ACTION UNDER THIS BILL. MORGAN YOU WANT TO TAKE THAT ONE. OKAY YES- THIS IS JUST A RUSE NO WAY NINE STRUCTURE THIS B. I DON'T THINK YOUR MICROPHONES ON MORE THAN ONE SECOND SO IT PUTS. TEN DAYS AGO. JUST TO REFRESH YOUR QUESTION MISTER CHAIR WOULD. THE MEMBER OF NARAL HAVE A CAUSE OF ACTION ARISES AFTER THEY'VE ACCEPTED AN OFFER OF EMPLOYMENT IS THAT YOUR QUESTION RIGHT AND THAT OFFER THEN IS RESCINDED BASED ON THE FACT THAT THERE. ACTIVITIES ARE ANTITHETICAL TO THE ORGANIZATION'S PURPOSE. AN AFFILIATION. OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD IT SEEMS UNCLEAR BUT IF THERE WAS KNOWN PROSPECTIVELY YOU KNOW FOR THE EMPLOYER THAT THIS PERSON HAD THESE BELIEFS THAT YOU KNOW THE PRO LIFE ORGANIZATION. WHO'S INTERVIEWING SOMEONE WHO PASSIONATELY BELIEVE IN THE RIGHT TO AN ABORTION. I WOULD READ THE LAW TO SAY THAT THE FOR THE EMPLOYER COULD RATIONALLY CONCLUDE THAT THAT WOULD NOT BE A GOOD CANDIDATE FOR THAT JOB JUST BASED ON. HOW DEDICATED THEY WOULD BE TO THEIR WORK SO IF. YOU KNOW THE MISSION OF THE ORGANIZATION IS TO PROMOTE ONE BECAUSE BUT- YOU WERE INTERVIEWING A CANDIDATE WHO BELIEVES IN THE OPPOSITE OF THAT BECAUSE AN EMPLOYER COULD RATIONALLY CONCLUDE THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO WORK VERY HARD FOR ME OR THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO WORK WELL WITH. MEMBERS OF THE TEAM SO I THINK IN THAT SITUATION. THAT WOULD BE A PERMISSIBLE. IT WOULD BE PERMISSIBLE FOR AN EMPLOYER TO. NOT HIRE THAT PERSON IT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE ON. A POLITICAL AFFILIATION GROUNDS BUT JUST ON THE RATIONAL BELIEF. TAKING POLITICAL AFFILIATION INTO CONSIDERATION BUT ON A RATIONAL BELIEF THAT. THEY'RE JUST SIMPLY NOT A SUITABLE EMPLOYEE FOR THAT POSITION. SORRY THANK YOU AT THAT THE EXCEPTION MAY SWALLOW UP THE RULE BUT MANY EVENTS CENTER WIENER. THANK YOU. I IS A QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR. SEVEN SO THIS IS AN EXAMPLE THAT WAS BROUGHT UP IN THE ANALYSIS ONE THAT I USE WAS IN FRONT OF. ME BEFORE I READ THE ANALYSIS SO SOMEONE. UNDER THIS IS A SORT OF BECOME LAW- AND SOME WOULD APPLY FOR A JOB IN THE COURSE OF THE INTERVIEW SAID EITHER THEY MENTIONS OR IT WAS JUST A TERM FROM THE SOCIAL MEDIA- THAT THERE ARE- A MEMBER OF THE ABOUT THEIR OTHERWISE OTHER THERE IN TERMS OF THEIR SKILLS FOR THE JOB. THAT THERE THERE'S QUALIFICATIONS FOR THE JOB AND THERE'S NO INDICATION THAT THEY WOULD LIKE. TRY TO DO THINGS THAT WORK BUT THEY ARE A MEMBER OF THE **** MOVEMENT AND THEY CELEBRATED ALSO ALERTS THAT ARE SENT TO SOME TAKING A- INTO AN EXTREME EXAMPLE THAT UNFORTUNATE DOES EXIST- WHAT GOT EM. SAWYER- BE ABLE TO RE ON. THE PERSON A MEMBER THE NOT MOVEMENT TO GET TO. AND ALL TIME IN THE IN THE SECOND PART OF IT HAVING SOMEONE WHO IS- SIMPLY. AND THEN THEY FIND OUT THAT THEY'RE THAT THEY'RE THEY WERE PARTICIPATING IN A **** MARCHERS IN VIOLENCE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. BUT THERE HAS BEEN A FULL **** MARCH WITH SWASTIKAS CETERA WOULD IT BE ABLE TO TERMINATE THAT PERSONS OF THE SORT OF SIMILAR QUESTIONS. OKAY I WILL AND- ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS AND THEN I AM GONNA ASK MORGAN TO JUST ADD ON TO THAT FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE- BUT AGAIN THIS GOES BACK. TO- IT'S AN EXTREME EXAMPLE THAT WAS GIVEN IN THE ANALYSIS BUT NONETHELESS THAT'S YOU KNOW. THE ONE WE WILL- ADDRESS A- IT IS. UNLIKELY THAT SOMEONE WHO IS A MEMBER OF THE WORK FOR A NERD OR ON ORGANIZATION THAT- YOU KNOW HAS THE EXACT OPPOSITE VIEWS BUT FOR THE PURPOSES OF ARGUMENT- I'M EMPLOYER STILL HAS THE RIGHT TO VIEW YOU KNOW YOU AS A CANDIDATE FOR EMPLOYMENT. IN YOUR ENTIRETY NOT JUST WHAT'S ON THE PAPER BUT HOW YOU COME ACROSS IN THE INTERVIEW WHAT YOUR INTERESTS ARE HOW WILL YOU INTERACT WITH THE REST OF THE EMPLOYEES HOW YOU FIT IN. TO THAT PLACE OF BUSINESS WILL IT BE A GOOD FIT FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED IT'S NOT. THE IT'S IN THE SO IT'S NOT BASED JUST ON THE FACT THAT YOU'RE PART OF SOME- MOVEMENT AND IT'S ALSO NOT BASED ON JUST THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE THE CERTAIN EDUCATIONAL DEGREE THAT IS REQUIRED OF THE JOB THERE ARE A WHOLE HOST OF THINGS. THAT ARE CONSIDERED- MORGAN DO YOU WANT TO TAP IN ON THE LEGAL. AGAIN SENATOR GOING FORWARD I THINK PART OF MY ANSWER WOULD DRAW FROM WHAT I PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED TO THE CHAIRS THAT. IN PERSPECTIVE WE HIRING SOMEONE NORTH- AN EMPLOYER COULD. PROBABLY RATIONALLY CONCLUDE BASED NON NOT ON DISCRIMINATORY REASONS THAT HIRING THIS PERSON WITH THESE EXTREME IDEOLOGICAL BELIEFS AND NATIONAL SOCIALISM WOULD SIMPLY BE A BAD CANDIDATE FOR EMPLOYMENT AT YOUR OFFICE BECAUSE OF. HOW IT WOULD AFFECT ALL OF THE OTHER EMPLOYEES BUT AS TO THE QUESTION ABOUT. COULD AN EMPLOYER TAKING ANY ADVERSE ACTION AGAINST THE EMPLOYEE FOR THEIR OFF. FURTHER THEY'RE ACTIVE IN THE POLITICAL ACTIVITIES WERE. BELIEVES OUTSIDE OF WORK. BASED ON WHAT I READ IN THE LABOR CODE SECTIONS ELEVEN OH ONE ELEVEN OH TWO AND SOME OF THE CASE LAWS THAT DISCUSSES IT THAT WOULD BE PROHIBITED AND THAT'S ALREADY CURRENT LAW THERE'S ALREADY BROUGHT BROUGHT PROVISIONS. IN CURRENT LAW THAT ENJOYING. LAWYERS FROM. PENALIZING THEIR EMPLOYEES FOR. THEIR THEIR PERSONAL POLITICAL ACTIVITIES ABSENT ANY OTHER EVIDENCE THAT IT IMPEDES THE WORKPLACE. AND IF I COULD FOLLOW UP SO APART FROM. DISSIPATION OF FORMAL ACTIVITY LIKE SAY I'M A MEMBER OF THIS PARTY WHAT ABOUT THEIR AGAIN OFFICE OFFICE HOURS ARE JUST POSTING THINGS ON SOCIAL MEDIA- POSTING YOU KNOW. POSTING FOR EXAMPLE IT'LL TELLER WAS YOU KNOW THE GREATEST LEADER EVER OR- OR YOU KNOW THE- YOU KNOW DAD. YOU KNOW JEWS AND LGBTQ PEOPLE SHOULD BE ROUNDED UP AND PUTTING CANCER WHATEVER VIEWS SOMEONE MIGHT. HAVE OFF HOURS ON THEIR PERSONAL SOCIAL MEDIA- THAT'S EXPRESSING. POLITICAL OPINION WHAT EMPLOYER BE ABLE TO SAY YOU KNOW WHY YOU CAN'T WORK HERE ANYMORE- BECAUSE THAT IS SO ANTITHETICAL. TO ONE YOU KNOW THE VALUES OF INCLUDE OF EXCLUSIVITY OF OUR OF THE GROCERY STORE THAT. I'VE YOUR CASHIER- ABSE ANY DIRECT EVIDENCE THAT IT IS CAUSING PROBLEMS REAL PROBLEMS IN THE WORKPLACE- JUST BASED ON. WHAT I'VE SEEN WITH THE LABOR CODE I DON'T BELIEVE THEY COULD NOW I'M- RIGHT AND THAT'S SAYING RETURNING ABOUT CURRENT LAW NOT MUCH WHAT THIS BILL DOES. SO ALTHOUGH I DON'T KNOW IF THE MARKET. DISPUTE ABOUT THAT BUT I PROJECT A VERY FRANK OKAY I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE RECORD THIS BILL DOESN'T ADDRESS YOU KNOW OUR CHANGE WHAT THE QUESTION THAT YOU'RE ASKING EXISTING LAW ALREADY ADDRESSES AT AND I WOULD ALSO JUST CHIME IN AND AGAIN I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY BUT- IF. WHEN YOU'RE TALKING NINE STATEMENTS MADE ABOUT IN ANTI SEMITIC STATEMENTS AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE THAT. I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT FALLS INTO THE REALM OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGY AS MUCH AS IT DOES- YOU KNOW FROM AN- HM YEAH I MEAN THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES- AND I DIDN'T UNFORTUNATELY ANTI SEMITISM KNOWS NOT ONLY ONE POLITICAL PARTY SOUND. ALREADY THANK YOU A SINGLE FOR THE MICROPHONE CENTREBOARD DISPOSABLE RAZOR MICROPHONE UP SIR BORDERS. YES I WAS GONNA AND ON THE MOVE THE BILL RIGHT SURFBOARDS SUPPOSED TO BILL- ON SATURDAY FOR THE DISCUSS SEVERAL INTO. CHEMICALS AM I DO CHAIR THING YOU- I WANNA THINK YOU FOR THE DISH OF DEBATE WANT TO THANK YOU WHO IN AND SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL- I. IF I REALLY TRULY BELIEVE THAT WE GO THE CIVIL THE- EXCUSE ME THE UNRUH- CIVIL RIGHTS ACT. YOU KNOW ALREADY STATED THIS IS PROTECTED I DO FEEL WE DO MAKE NEED TO MAKE THIS DECLARATION WITHIN OUR CODE- TODAY'S VOTE. IF THE BAIL IF THE BILL FAILS HI YOU KNOW MY FEAR IS IT'S GOING TO GIVE A GREEN LIGHT TO FROM. CENSORSHIP THEINTENT OF THIS BILL IS TO ALLOW THE FREE EXCHANGE EXCHANGE OF IDEAS AMONGST A POPULATION FULL OF DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES AND OUR COUNTRY IS FOUNDED ON THESE PRINCIPLES THAT'S WHY WE THE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE CONSIDER OURSELVES A DELIBERATIVE BODY. I AM AN ORGANIZATION A MEMBERS FREELY CAPABLE AND WILLING TO DEBATE IDEAS AND THIS IS MOST CERTAINLY AN IDEA WORKS PRESERVING. WE SHOULD NOT DIMINISH YOUR SUPPORT ACTIVE SILENCING AND CENSORSHIP SO SENATORS- I WILL LEAVE YOU WITH THIS THOUGHT. AS WE ALL KNOW SOCIAL MEDIA SO THE FACEBOOKS INSTAGRAMS TWITTERS OF THE WORLD THEY ARE COMMON COMMUNICATION MEDIUMS NOT ONLY FOR US FOR CHILDREN. AND IMAGINE IT TEN YEARS FROM NOW. TWELVE YEARS FIFTEEN YEARS YOU KNOW WHEN THOSE CHILDREN. BECOME ADULTS CENTER PLAYING FOR THEIR DREAM JOB IN A TWEET IS DISCOVERED SEEING HOW THEY SUPPORTED YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OR USE SENATOR WHITE HOUSE SKI- OR YOU CENTER BORJAS. AND THEY WERE DENIED THAT JOB BECAUSE OF THEIR DECLARATION OF THAT SUPPORT. AND THEN IMAGINE HOW YOU WOULD FEEL IF YOU KNEW TEN YEARS AGO THAT YOU HAD THE POWER TO ENSURE SOMETHING LIKE THAT WOULD NOT HAPPEN TO THEM- TODAY'S TARGETS ARE ONE PARTICULAR GROUP. TOMORROW'S TARGETS COULD BE AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT GROUP AND I DO THINK IT IS TIME THAT WE SET THE POLITICAL. DIFFERENCES ASIDE AND RECOGNIZE THIS FOR THE PROBLEM THAT IT IS BECOMING AN ADDRESS IT NOW AND ADDRESS IT SWIFTLY AND WITH THAT I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU SIR MELINDA'S- CHIEF COUNSEL ESTRADA WE CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. IS THAT SPEED TO THIRTY EIGHT BY SENATOR MELENDEZ- MOTION SENATOR BOARD YES THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE RE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS- BURKE ALL. AMBERG NO PORGES.

CASKEY NO WIENER NO WIENER NO SO FAR YOU HAVE ONE TO FIVE WE'LL WE'LL PUT THAT BILL ON CALL ON THE NEXT RETURNED TO SENDER MELINDA'S BILL SB TWO FORTY NINE. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE ON THE PHONE- WISHING TO TESTIFY ON S. B. TWO FORTY NINE WE HAVE SOME CHALLENGES OF THE PREVIOUS BILL. SO WE WILL TAKE. TESTIMONY PROP FROM THOSE WHO ARE THE PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT TWO MINUTES EACH AND THEN. OPPOSITION AND THEN FOR THOSE ON THE PHONE IF YOU WILL DIAL IN- AND FOLLOW THE PROMPTS. PROVIDE US YOUR NAME YOUR AFFILIATION IN YOUR POSITION SO- SEN LINDA'S SB TWO FORTY NINE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND BEFORE I BEGIN WITH THIS BILL I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I REQUESTED RECONSIDERATION OF A BILL TO SAYS B. TWO THIRTY EIGHT- IS THERE IS THERE A MOTION. IN CENTER BOARD JUST MOVES RECONSIDERATION WITHOUT OBJECTION ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU SO MUCH- I SAID THIS IS GOING TO SOUND A LITTLE FAMILIAR SINCE I'VE ALREADY GONE THROUGH HALF OF THIS ONCE ALREADY SO BEAR WITH ME. BY MISTER CHAIRMAN SENATORS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT SENATE BILL TWO FORTY NINE THE INTELLECTUAL DIVERSITY ACT WHICH SEEKS TO ADDRESS DISCRIMINATION BASED UPON POLITICAL AFFILIATION AND OUR SCHOOLS. ARE SCHOOLS AND CLASSROOMS ARE OFTEN THE BIRTHPLACE OF IDEAS IN POLITICAL FIGHTS THE PROVIDER STUDENTS WITH EXPOSURE TO ALL IDEAS AND PERSPECTIVES A CENTURY THAT SHOULD BE CELEBRATED AND ENCOURAGED. HOWEVER TODAY E ARE SEEING FOR TOO MANY PROFESSORS AND TEACHERS DO THE OPPOSITE. THE I JUST THE OTHER DAY IT WAS REPORTED AS SEEN DIEGO TEACHER WAS OVERHEARD ON ZOOM BE READING A STUDENTS PARENTS. BECAUSE THEY WERE EXPRESSING THEIR- DISPLEASURE WITH THE HYBRID LEARNING AND WANTED FULL IN PERSON LEARNING. THE PARENT WHO EXPOSES T. WAS QUOTED AS SAYING I HELD ON TO THE VIDEO FOR THREE MONTHS AND HARDLY TOLD A SOUL. RETALIATION CALIFORNIA'S EDUCATION CODE PROTECTS VARIOUS CHARACTERISTICS FROM BOWLING SUCH AS RELIGION AND ETHNICITY. BUT IT DOES NOT INCLUDE ONE POLITICAL VIEWPOINT OR AFFILIATIONS. IF WE ARE GOING TO ALLOW SIXTEEN YEAR OLDS TO PRE REGISTER TO VOTE WHILE IN HIGH SCHOOL. THEY SHOULD BE FREE OF BOWLING FROM TEACHERS AND FELLOW STUDENTS REGARDING THEIR POLITICAL AFFILIATIONS. THIS IMPLEMENTS AND NEGATIVITY IS MORE VISIBLE. ON OUR COLLEGE CAMPUSES. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN HARVARD STUDENTS TRYING TO PREVENT. RAMPANT MINISTRATION OFFICIALS FROM APPEARING AS-SPEAKERS ON THEIR CAMPUS EVEN THEIR SEVEN U. S. PRESIDENTS HAVE CALLED HER IT'S ALMA MATER INCLUDING. PRESIDENTS OBAMA GEORGE W. BUSH AND JOHN F. KENNEDY. IN TWENTY TWENTY ANOTHER PETITION BY HARVARD STUDENTS ATTEMPTED TO HAVE. THE EDUCATIONAL DEGREES OF TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS REVOKED. NOW AS I SAID EARLIER THIS IS A PRIVATE INSTITUTION CAN THEY DO THIS YES OF COURSE THEY CAN'T SHOULD THEY BE DOING THIS NOW SHE WE BE. ENCOURAGING AND TRYING TO MOTIVATE THEM TO NOT ENGAGE IN THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR IN CALIFORNIA ABSOLUTELY JUST LIKE WE DO WITH A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER ISSUES. THE MISSION STATEMENT FOR UCLA INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING. IT SAYS TO FULFILL THIS MISSION UCLA'S COMMITTED TO ACADEMIC FREEDOM IN ITS FULLEST TERMS WE VALUE OPEN ACCESS TO INFORMATION FREE AND LIVELY DEBATE CONDUCTED WITH MUTUAL RESPECT FOR INDIVIDUALS AND FREEDOM FROM INTOLERANCE AND ALL OUR PURSUITS WE STRIVE AT ONCE FOR EXCELLENCE AND DIVERSITY RECOGNIZING THAT OPENNESS AND INCLUSION PRODUCE TRUE QUALITY QUALITY. CALIFORNIA IS NOT THE ONLY STATE TO CONFRONT THIS GROWING PROBLEM IN MONTANA THERE GOVERNOR SIGNED TWO BILLS THAT AIM TO PROTECT FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND ASSOCIATION ON PUBLIC UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES IN THE STATE. IT FOR UNIVERSITY FROM DENYING RETIREES. TO RELIGIOUS POLITICAL OR IDEOLOGICAL STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS EVEN IF THEY HOLD VIEWS THE OTHER STUDENTS MAY FIND OFFENSIVE. THE NORTH DAKOTA HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES PASSED A BILL PROHIBITING ACTIVITY FEE FUNDING DISCRIMINATION BASED ON. A STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS VIEWPOINT. COOLEY HAD TO SETTLE A LAWSUIT FOR CHANGE FOR CHARGING A SECURITY FEE. FOR BEN SHAPIRO THAT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE FEE THAT THEY CHARGE FOR SUPREME COURT JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR. OUR THOUGHTS IN BELIEF SYSTEMS ARE FACING CENSORSHIP CANCELLATION AND ATTACKS AND IT IS TIME TO PROTECT THEM HOW CAN WE EXPECT OUR STUDENTS TO LEAVE OUR SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES. ACKNOWLEDGING THAT OTHER PERSPECTIVES AND THOUGHTS EXIST IF WE ALLOW THIS SELF SILENCING OR BULLYING TO CONTINUE. SB TWO FORTY NINE MAKES IT CLEAR THAT WE VALUE THE EDUCATION OF OUR STUDENTS AND THEIR EXPOSURE TO OPINIONS OF OTHERS. EVEN IF WE DON'T AGREE WITH THAT. IT ALSO ENSURES THAT EDUCATORS CAN NOT RETALIATING IN STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS ON CAMPUS BASED UPON THEIR POLITICAL AFFILIATION OR BELIEFS. TODAY'S HYPERPARTISAN AND POLARIZED WORLD IS ONLY EXASPERATING THE TRANS OF ONE SIDED DIALOGUES THAT IF LEFT UNCHECKED. IT'S I MEAN WE'RE IN COURSE TO DESTROY THE VERY FABRIC OF OUR COUNTRY AND THE THINGS THAT WE BELIEVE IN. HERE TO TESTIFY VIA TELECONFERENCE IS CHRIS ACOSTA STUDENT WHO INJECTS PRINCE'S FIRST HAND MR WILL WAIT FROM PRAGER UNIVERSITY- HE WAS WITNESSES. HAND HIMSELF THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- AND I BELIEVE MY WITNESSES ARE READY TO TESTIFY. THANK YOU CENTER MELINDA'S- MISTER.

PAPERWORK WITH THE SCHOOL I RECEIVED NOTHING FROM SCHOOL AND WITH THE DEADLINE TO MIGRATE MACHINE LEARNING I CONTACTED. SENATOR WHO BOUGHT TO HELP ME GET BACK IN THE CLASS. ONE EXPERIENCE I HAD WITH THIS PROFESSOR IN THE CLEAR VIOLATION OF FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS IT WAS A PAINFUL REMINDER THAT IN TODAY'S HYPER POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT IT'S REPUBLICANS COULD FACE AN UPHILL BATTLE.

CENSORED AND BEING TREATED UNFAIRLY ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES IT'S ACTUALLY A RAMPANT PROBLEM THAT I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO KNOWLEDGE BUT SHE'S ACTUALLY INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT JUST LAST WEEK AT MY ATTENTION- BLACK LIVES MATTER PROTESTERS CAME DESTROYED THE EVENT AND THEN THEY ENDED UP KICKING ME OFF OF CAMPUS. BECAUSE I WAS MAKING PEOPLE ON SAFE AND THE ADMINISTRATION WORKED WITH BLACK LIVES MATTER WE HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF VERY SCARED YOU KNOW WHO GOT BAD GRADES BECAUSE A PROFESSOR TOLD US THAT THE CONSTITUTION WAS IN A GOOD SOURCE OF INFORMATION WOULD YOU TRY TO USE IN A PUBLIC SPEAKING CLASS WITH RYAN PALMER SUSPENDED FROM HIS HIGH SCHOOL FOR A WEEK. FOR DEFENDING HIS CONSERVATIVE BELIEFS THAT THE SCHOOL LABELED AS HATE SPEECH COOLEY JAMISON HARASSED BY STUDENTS FOR HER CONSERVATIVE POLICE AND ALL THE SITUATIONS I WOULD JUST LIKE TO REMIND YOU ALL THAT THE PROFESSORS AND THE ADMINISTRATION SAID NOTHING SO YOU KNOW SOMETIMES OF COURSE CHILDREN FIGHT IN THEIR DIFFERENCES IN POLITICAL OPINIONS THAT'S ALL WELL AND GOOD. BUT WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO THE PROFESSORS AREN'T SUPPORTING STUDENTS BEING ABLE TO HAVE A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION THAT'S WHERE YOU HAVE A REAL PROBLEM WE HAVE DANIEL SUBPOENA CAL STATE MONTEREY BAY WAS FORCED TO QUIT A WATER POLO TEAM BECAUSE YOUR COACH AND ALL THE OTHER STUDENTS. ON THE TEAM WERE ALL ON THE FAR LEFT. INBECAUSE SHE WAS A CONSERVE. SHE BALK THERE AND YOU. FRENCH IS A STATE- I PROFESSOR MARKETS RELIGIONS AND CONSERVATIVE VIEWPOINTS DURING CLASS. AND IS IT OKAY STILL SILENCERS IN CLASS BY PROFESSORS FOR BEING CONSERVATIVE. AT CSUF. THIS HAPPENS ALL OVER ALL THE TIME WHERE CONSERVATIVES BEING CENSORED FREE SPEECH AND EXPRESSION. SHOULD BE AT THE FOREFRONT OF AMERICANS EDUCATION THE SADLY THAT'S- DEFINITELY NOT THE CASE HERE IN AMERICA AND WHAT THE STUDENTS ARE HAILED AS BRAVE AND STRONG.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I JUST WANTED TO- RECOGNIZE THE AUTHOR ON THIS BILL THIS IS THIS IS IN THE SPEAKER THAT CALLED IN MISTER WITT THIS IS A- YEAH I THINK A VERY IMPORTANT BILL- I'M REMEMBERING BACK- WHEN I WAS A SINGLE STATE. I WAS A SENIOR STATE NINETEEN NINETY NINETEEN NINETY ONE WHEN PETE WILSON WAS GOVERNOR. AND THEY WERE REBUILDING THE BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION BUILDING- THAT YEAR SO THERE IS A BIG WOODEN WALL AROUND THE CONSTRUCTION SITE OF THE BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION BUILDING WHICH I WAS THAT'S WHAT I WAS MAJORING IN SO. I WAS THERE QUITE A BIT AND THE STUDENTS HAD TAKEN. IT UPON THEMSELVES TO MAKE IT AT A WALL A FIRST AMENDMENT EXPRESSION WALL I DON'T KNOW IF THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE COLLEGE EVER THOUGHT THE TEST WAS GOING TO HAPPEN OR NOT. BUT BUT THOSE OF YOU MAY REMEMBER PETE WILSON WASN'T SO POPULAR WITH COLLEGE STUDENTS BACK THEN I WASN'T POLITICALLY ACTIVE- WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE- NOR MOTIVATED BUT I DID APPRECIATE THE- THE DIALOGUE OR THE DEBATE OR CONTROVERSY OR- YOU KNOW JUST WATCHING THE DIFFERENT SIDES OF THE ISSUE AND THE ISSUE BACK THEN WAS A PRETTY SIMPLE ONE- P. WILSON- AND THE LEGISLATURE WAS RAISING FEES AT THE ON THE CSU SYSTEM- FAIRLY DRAMATICALLY. AND ALLOW THE STUDENTS DID APPRECIATE THAT I THINK EVEN ONE DAY- AND I DON'T THINK I WOULD AGREE WITH THIS BUT IT I BELIEVE IT'S PROTECTED BY THE FIRST MINUTE THEY THEY BURNT AN EFFIGY OF. PETE WILSON I THOUGHT THAT WAS- UNFORTUNATE. BUT- THE DIALOGUE WAS IMPORTANT AND THE DEBATE WAS IMPORTANT AND I THINK THAT IT ADDED CERTAINLY TO MY EXPERIENCE AS A COLLEGE STUDENT- AS AN AS AN ENGAGED COLLEGE STUDENT EITHER SIDE OF THE ISSUE- BUT FOR THE FOLKS THAT WERE ENGAGED ON THE EITHER SIDE OF THE SHOULD CERTAINLY WAS IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THEIR VOICES HEARD. MY OLDEST SON AND MY DAUGHTER BOTH OF GRADUATE FROM ST YOU STATE NOW MY OLDEST SON WHEN HE GOT TO SENIOR STATE ABOUT. EIGHT YEARS AGO I HIS FIRST. SEMESTER THERE WAS A RELIGIOUS DEBATE GOING ON A PRO LIFE- PRO ABORTION DEBATE GOING ON. ON CAMPUS AND- HE ENGAGED IN THAT CONVERSATION. AND REALLY- AND THAT THAT GOT TO BE A VERY SERIOUS CONVERSATION BUT AGAIN. IT WAS HEALTHY- IT WAS IT'S PROTECTED UNDER FIRST AMENDMENT. AND IS ADDS TO. THE DOOR OF WHAT MAKES AMERICA GREAT IS THIS ABILITY FOR. OPPOSING VIEWS. TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE SOMETIMES A VERY PASSIONATE- BUT PEACEFUL MANNER. AND SO I I'M I'M GONNA BE SUPPORTING THE BILL I'LL MAKE THE MOTION FOR APPROVAL WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE MISTER CHAIR AND- JUST WANTED TO I THANK THE AUTHOR FOR. WORKING SO DILIGENTLY ON THESE FREE SPEECH ISSUES THANK YOU RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER JOHNSON OR JOHNS CENTER BORDERS. MISTER CHAIRMAN. OR MAKE CERTAIN THAT WE- TAKE A STEP BACK THE- S. B. TWO THREE EIGHT THEY'RE TOTALLY DIFFERENT PIECES OF LEGISLATION. WITH- I THINK. DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT- CIRCUMSTANCES I KNOW IN THE LAST BILL THERE WAS- SOME WORST CASE SCENARIOS THAT WERE BROUGHT FORWARD I THINK IT MEANS LESS SOME FOLKS A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE- I WILL I PARTICULARLY WASN'T BUT I THINK SOME FOLKS MAY HAVE BEEN. BUT TWO FOUR NINE IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT. AND I'VE MENTIONED THIS ON THE FOR MANY TIMES- I TAUGHT FOR OVER TEN YEARS AND I GOTTA TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT. THE MARKET PLACE OF IDEAS IN SCHOOLS. SEEMS TO BE DEGRADED AT LEAST TO ME. NOW I HAPPEN TO GO TO VERY LIBERAL ARTS SCHOOLS WHEN I WAS GOING THROUGH MY COLLEGE GRAD AND POST GRAD EXPERIENCE. BUT ESPECIALLY LAW SCHOOL PROFESSORS WANT. YOU TO ENGAGE ON ON ISSUES CAN TAKE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES EVEN IF YOU DISAGREED WITH THEM THEY WOULD ASK YOU TO TAKE THE OPPOSITE PERSPECTIVE. AND FASHION AN ARGUMENT EVEN THOUGH YOU PERSONALLY DISAGREED WITH THAT. I THOUGHT THAT WAS FANTASTIC TRAINING AND I THINK WHAT THIS DOES IS IT HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR US TO FOSTER IN OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM. THAT SENSE THAT WE NEED TO EXPLORE AND BE EXPOSED TO THESE DIFFERENT IDEAS. ARM AND NOT ALLOW FOR THERE TO BE A PREVAILING WISDOM CULTURE AND I THINK THAT IT HAS CERTAINLY TAKEN ITS COURSE. WHERE YOU MAY OF PHILLY- IN ONE DIRECTION ON THE SPECTRUM OR WHATEVER- WHATEVER PART OF THE COUNTRY YOU MAY LIVE IN I THINK THAT IS DANGEROUS AND WE SHOULD FIGHT THAT AT EVERY TURN. BECAUSE I WANT WHEN MY BOYS GO TO SCHOOL. I WANT THEM TO BE CHALLENGED. BECAUSE IF THEY ARE PART OF THE PREVAILING WISDOM. PROCESS WITHIN THEIR NOT GOING TO BE CHALLENGED APPROPRIATELY INTELLECTUALLY. AND I WANT THAT TO HAPPEN. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT EVERY SCHOOL IS FOSTERING THAT APPROACH AND I THINK WHAT THIS DOES IS IT REINFORCES THAT THAT THIS THAT SCHOOLS ARE PETRI DISHES THEIR EXPERIMENTS OF THOUGHT. THAT IS THE BEAUTY OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE EXPERIENCE WHICH MAKES IT THE GOLD STANDARD AROUND THE GLOBE. AND I THINK THAT OVER GENERATIONS THAT HAS SUBSIDED SOMEWHAT AND I DON'T LIKE IT. SO I THINK WHAT THIS DOES IT REALLY REAFFIRMS THAT IF YOU HAVE AN AFFILIATION FOR A MIND SET. ON THAT YOU WERE GIVEN. A DEGREE OF EQUAL PROTECTION IN THE EDUCATIONAL INTELLECTUAL PROCESS AND I THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT BUT FOR THOSE OF OU WHO MIGHT STILL BE IN THE MINDSET OF THE LAST BILL. WE WERE DEALING WITH. THIS IS DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT ONCE AGAIN. IT FURTHER SPECIFIES TWO FOUR NINE DOES FURTHER SPECIFIES THAT NO PERSON SHALL BE SUBJECTED TO DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF THEIR POLITICAL IF IT FILIATION ANY PROGRAM OR ACTIVITY CONDUCTED BY AN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION. HATE SPEECH AND HATE ORGANIZATIONS. ARE NOT ALLOWED. IN IN- IN IN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES YOU MAY HAVE INDIVIDUALS AT A SPELLS THOSE THINGS BUT ORGANIZATIONALLY- THEY'RE NOT TO BE PERMITTED TO THIS IS DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT I THINK THE CONCERNS THAT WE HEARD BEFORE SHOULD BE RELATIVELY ASSUAGED BY THIS AND IF WE ARE FUNDING STATE PROGRAMS I WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT WE HAVE CRITICAL THINKERS AND WE CAN'T DO THAT. IF WE ALLOW INTELLECTUAL INERTIA TO BE THE DOMINANT CULTURE OF COLLEGE. THANK YOU SIR BORDERS ASSEMBLY CASKEY. MISTER CAREY. I APPRECIATE THE INTELLECTUALS A CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO- AS- WITH DESIRE AND I DO TOO HAVE A QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR I'M ON PAGE EIGHT OF THE STAFF REPORT. TALKING RAISING THE QUESTION OF WHETHER WE'RE GING TO BE MANDATING. NEW TRIP- POLITICAL NEUTRALITY- AND IF THAT WAS IS THE AUTHOR'S INTENT. AND IS IT TOO I GUESS CN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS BE SUED- UNDER THE BILL F THE PROGRAMS AND- ACTIVITIES ARE NOT POLITICALLY NEUTRAL MEDICAL WITHIN ABOUT. SEVEN FORCE TALKS ABOUT IF YOU. HAVE ONE PAGE OF KARL MARX SHIFT HAVE. ONE PAGE OF ADAM SMITH AND IF IT'S NOT. FIFTY FIFTY THAT YOU- OF CAUSE OF ACTION MAY ARISE SO I'D BE INTERESTED IN IT. AUTHORS OPINION. MR YES CENTER MELINDA'S THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU CENTER ACCOUNTS YOU FOR THE QUESTION- IS SO NO THE BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE POLITICAL NEUTRALITY ANYMORE DAN SCHOOLS ARE REQUIRED TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THE YOU KNOW A CERTAIN NUMBER OF REPUBLICANS IN IN TEACHING THE CLASSES A CERTAIN NUMBER OF DEMOCRATS A CERTAIN NUMBER OF LIBERTARIANS WE DON'T REQUIRE THAT THIS IS NOT REQUIRING POLITICAL NEUTRALITY THIS IS REQUIRING- FAIRNESS AND HOUSE ALL STUDENTS ARE TREATED IRRESPECTIVE OF THEIR- POLITICAL IDEOLOGY OR BELIEFS I WANT TO- COMMENT THOUGH ON BECAUSE A LOT OF DISCUSSION HAS BEEN TAKING PLACE ABOUT THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS- AND I YOU KNOW I WILL TELL YOU. ARE I WAS A BIT TAKEN ABACK AT THE EXTREME EXAMPLES THAT WERE GIVEN IN THE ANALYSIS AND IT. YOU KNOW THIS IS A THIS IS A TOPIC WORTHY OF DISCUSSION AYE. AYE I JUST WAS CURIOUS AS TO WHY SUCH EXTREME EXAMPLES WERE USED- TO DEBATE THIS VERY REAL ISSUE AND- I. YOU KNOW I WILL JUST TELL YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- ON A PERSONAL LEVEL I FOUND I THINK WE CAN DO COMMITTEE ANALYSES WITHOUT- OUR SUCH VULGARITIES EXPRESSED I DON'T THINK THAT WAS NECESSARY I THINK THAT WAS OVER THE TOP AS A WOMAN I WAS OFFENDED I WAS INSULTED I'M SURE THE FEMALE MEMBERS OF MY STAFF. DIDN'T APPRECIATE SOME OF THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS USED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS I GET THAT HE WAS TRYING TO MAKE THAT POINT. BE THAT AS IT MAY I THOUGHT I WOULD GO ON THE RECORD AND SAY THAT BUT MR RIGHT COMES KEY TO YOUR POINT IT DOES NOT REQUIRE POLITICAL NEUTRALITY AB GRADE IF EVERYBODY WAS YOU KNOW A LITTLE MORE OPEN MINDED IN NATURE BUT THAT'S JUST NT REALITY. WE CAN LEGISLATE THAT EVEN IF WE TRIED. ALL RIGHT I SEE NO THEIR MICROPHONES UP YOUR COMMON DESERT CENTER MELINDA'S- CENTER JONES HAS MOVED THE BILL- SETTLED MELENDEZ BEFORE YOU CLOSE AND I HATE TO. CREATE ANY CONFUSION HERE BUT GOING BACK TO THE PREVIOUS BILL THE OTHER WAS MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION. THAT MOTION IS NOT PROPER UNTIL THERE'S BEEN AN ACTUAL DETERMINATION OF THE FATE OF THE BILL AND SO AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME I ASSUME THAT MOTION WILL BE RENEWED- BUT LET'S NOW TURN TO. S. B. TWO FORTY NINE FOR YOUR CLOTHES IF YOU SHOULD SO CHOOSE WONDERFUL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- I WILL TRY TO BE BRIEF IN MY COMMENTS I KNOW YOU HAVE MANY MORE BILLS TO GO THROUGH SO I WANT TO THANK YOU- FOR THE VERY BRIEF DEBATE THAT WE HAD ON THIS PARTICULAR BILL. AND WE'VE SPENT A LARGE PART OF THIS AFTERNOON SO FOR DISCUSSING WHAT I VIEW TO BE A VERY CHALLENGING ISSUE TO TACKLE WHICH IS YOU KNOW WHAT IS SPEECH IN WHAT SHOULD OR SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED IN OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR COLLEGE CAMPUSES. IF STUDENTS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO EXPLORE VALUE AND BELIEF SYSTEMS THAT ARE NOT THEIR OWN IT'S GOING TO LIMIT THEIR EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE. AND THAT'S NOT- GOING TO HELP THEM CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO HELP THOSE. WHO THEY MAY EVENTUALLY WORK FOR. THAT NOBODY IS ASKING FOR A QUOTA SYSTEM OR A TALLY. OF RENO REPUBLICANS VERSUS DEMOCRATS VERSUS LIBERTARIANS IS FOR ITS SPEAKERS ARE INFLUENCERS ARE TEACHERS. NO ONE IS CALLING FOR EQUITABLE RATIOS- OF PROFESSORS TO BE HIRED ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES EITHER WHAT I WE ARE CALLING FOR IN THIS BILL. IS TONING DOWN THE RHETORIC ON OUR CLASSROOMS AT SEEK TO CHALLENGER SILENCE VIEWS THAT HAPPEN TO BE DIFFERENT. WE EXCUSE ME PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA. SAID AT A TOWN HALL IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THESE ARE HIS WORDS. I DON'T AGREE THAT YOU WHEN YOU BECOME STUDENTS AT COLLEGES. HAVE TO BE CODDLED AND PROTECTED FROM DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW. HE WAS DISCUSSING HOW COLLEGES ARE NOT JUST SPACES FOR LEARNING SKILLS. BUT ABOUT BROADENING IN KNOWLEDGE BASE WHEN HE SAID FURTHER THAT THE WAY TO DO THAT IS TO CREATE A SPACE. FOR A LOT OF IDEAS ARE PRESENTED AND THEY COLLIDED PEOPLE ARE HAVING ARGUMENTS IN PEOPLE ARE TESTING EACH OTHER'S THEORIES IN OVERTIME. LEARN FROM ONE ANOTHER. THIS IS WHAT WE WANT OUT OF OUR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND IN OUR CLASSROOMS- I WILL CLOSE WITH THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN AND JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I.

SB SIX SIXTY JUST- FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES. THOSE OF YOU THAT CONCERNED ABOUT TIME WE ARE ON TRACK TO FINISH BEFORE THE FIRST COMMITTEES MEET TOMORROW MORNING AT NINE AM JUST SO YOU KNOW. SO ALL RIGHT. SEVEN NEWMAN SB. SIX SIXTY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS- I'M HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY TO ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF SB SIX SIX ZERO AS THE CHAIR HAS ALREADY NOTED I HAD ANOTHER BILL SB SIX SIX THREE WHICH I HAVE WITHDRAWN. THEIR VERY DIFFERENT BILLS AND SO SB SIX X. THREE IS NOW TO YOUR BILL- UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF S. B. SINCE. SB SIX SIX THREE IS A TO YOUR BILL CORRECT THAT IS CORRECT SIR I JUST TOOK SB SIX SIX ZERO IS TODAY'S BILL. IT'S A TODAY BILL. UNDER ITS PROVISIONS SB SIX SIX ZERO. WILL ELIMINATE COMMON PRACTICE IN THE GATHERING OF SIGNATURES. FOR BALLOT MEASURES WHICH INCENTIVIZE THE WILLFUL DECEPTION OF VOTERS. SB SIX SIXTY WILL TAKE NECESSARY IMPORTANT STEPS TOWARDS SAFEGUARDING THE INTEGRITY OF CALIFORNIA'S INITIATIVE. REFERENDUM AND RECALL PROCESS WHICH- CALIFORNIA'S ONE OF A NUMBER OF STATES WHOSE CONSTITUTIONS EXPRESS REVISED ITS CITIZENS WITH TOOLS TO DIRECTLY ADDRESS ABUSES OF GOVERNMENT OR MALFEASANCE. BY PUBLIC OFFICIALS IN THE FORM OF THE INITIATIVE THE REFERENDUM AND THE RECALL EFFORT SOME HISTORICAL BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT. AS YOU MAY BE AWARE THESE ADMIRABLE AND USEFUL CONSTITUTIONAL DIRECT DEMOCRACY PROVISIONS DATE BACK MORE THAN A CENTURY. WHAT ARE THE RESULTS OF THE EFFORTS OF A GROUP OF PROGRESSIVE REFORMERS LED BY THEN GOVERNOR HIRAM JOHNSON. WHO THEN WENT ON TO BECOME CALIFORNIA'S LONGEST SERVING REPRESENTED THE UNITED STATES SENATE. UNTIL HIS TWENTY EIGHT YEARS IN OFFICE WAS RECENTLY ECLIPSED BY OUR OWN CENTER DIANNE FEINSTEIN. AS A RESULT OF THE HEROIC EFFORTS OF GOVERNOR JOHNSON AND HIS SUPPORTERS. CALIFORNIA'S CONSTITUTION THROUGH THE INITIATIVE REFERENDUM AND RECALL MAKES EXPLICIT PROVISIONS THAT ALLOW FOR THE CITIZEN READ TO TAKE ACTIONS OUTSIDE OF THE NORMAL LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. IN ORDER TO ENACT OR REPEAL LEGISLATION OR TO REMOVE A CORRUPT OR MALFEASANCE ELECTED OFFICIAL FROM OFFICE. TO THE ORIGINAL FRAMERS WAY OF THINKING THE INITIATIVE REFERENDUM AND RECALL REPRESENTED A MEANS FOR THE LITTLE GUY. TO ACHIEVE DIRECT CURATIVE AND REFORMIST ACTIONS THAT ELECTED INVESTED INTEREST MIGHT OTHERWISE SPORT. BECAUSE THE FRAMERS OF THE INITIATIVE REFERENDUM AND RECALL REGARD THESE PROCESSES AS POPULIST ACTIONS OF LAST RESORT. THE DELIVERY PROVIDED THAT IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR THE BALLOT PROPONENTS OF ANY OF THESE DIRECT TO THE VOTERS PLEASE BESIDES. WOULD FIRST BE REQUIRED TO GATHER A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF VOTER SIGNATURES TO VALIDATE THE LEGITIMACY AND POPULAR SUPPORT FOR SUCH AN ACTION. OVER THE YEARS ESPECIALLY IN RECENT DECADES HOWEVER SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE FRAMERS INTENDED HAS TRANSPIRED THESE TOOLS ARE DIRECTOR MARCUS C. HAVE BEEN AFFECTED. BY THE VERY. MONEY INTEREST THEY WERE ORIGINALLY CREATED TO OFF SET. AS THESE FUNDED GROUP WITH X. INCREASINGLY EXPLICIT SELF INTERESTED MOTIVATIONS HAVE BECOME EVER MORE ADEPT AT USING. THE INITIATIVE REFERENDUM AND RECALL PROCESS IS TO THEIR BENEFIT. SOMETHING OF AN ARMS RACE AROUND THESE PROCESSES HAS ENSUED ESPECIALLY AS IT PERTAINS TO SIGNATURE GATHERING. AT THE CENTER OF THESE EFFORTS A SMALL NUMBER OF SPECIALIZED FIRMS WITH EXPERTISE INSECURE GATHERING HAVE RISEN TO THE FORE. AND OFFER THEIR SERVICES TO REPORT TO PROPONENTS SEEKING TO PLACE A MEASURE ON THE BALLOT. ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL TACTICS USED BY THE SPECIALIZED ENGINEERING FIRMS IS THE DEPLOYMENT OF WELL TRAINED PROFESSIONAL SIGNATURE GATHERERS. TYPICALLY THE SIGNATURE GATHERS ARE PAID ON A PER SIGNATURE OR COMMISSION BASIS ALSO KNOWN AS A BOUNTY. AT A RATE DETERMINED BY THE MARKET AS IT IS ASSESSED AT THAT TIME. DEPENDING ON THE NATURE THE INITIATIVE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DISTRICT THAT TIME OF YEAR FOR COMPETITION WITH OTHER EMISSIONS AT ANY GIVEN TIME THE COST PER SIGNATURE CAN VARY WIDELY FROM AS LOW AS TWO DOLLARS PER SIGNATURE GATHERED. TO AS HIGH AS TWENTY DOLLARS. BECAUSE BOUNTY PAID SIGNATURE GATHERS ARE INCENTIVIZED TO OPTIMIZE THEIR YIELD BASED ON HOW RAPIDLY THEY CAN SECURE SIGNATURES FROM VOTERS. THEY FREQUENTLY TRAFFIC MISDIRECTION MISLEADING INFORMATION AND OUTRIGHT FALSEHOODS IN ORDER TO INDUCE AS MANY VOTERS AS POSSIBLE TO SIGN IN THE MINIMUM. AMOUNT OF TIME. AGAINST THIS BACKDROP THE DETERMINING FACTOR GETTING MEASURE ON THE BALLOT TOO OFTEN HAS LESS TO DO WITH ITS POLICY MERITS. IN THE DEPTH OF ITS PROPONENTS POCKETS OF COURSE THIS ISN'T EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT THE FRAMERS ORIGINALLY HAD IN MIND. AS THE DIRECT RESULT OF THESE PERVERSE INCENTIVES THE PAPER SIGNATURE SYSTEM HAS SUBVERTED THE ORIGINAL IDEALISTIC INTENT. OF CALIFORNIA'S FOUNDERS WHO ENVISIONED A PEOPLE POWERED SYSTEM OF REFERENDA IN PROPOSITIONS VALIDATED BY DEMONSTRATED PUBLIC SUPPORT. AND WHICH WOULD SUCCEED OR FAIL ON THEIR MERITS NOT ON HOW WELL THE SYSTEM CAN BE GAMED. INITIAL REFERENDUM AND RECALL PROCESSES CAN AND SHOULD PLAY AN IMPORTANT AND VALUED ROLE IN CALIFORNIA POLITICS AND ITS GOVERNANCE. IT HAS BECOME CLEAR HOWEVER. THAT UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM DRIVEN BY FOR SIGNATURE ABOUT. THERE ARE SCANT. FOR DETERRING ACTORS WHO WILLFULLY MISLEAD VOTERS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE INTEGRITY OF THE ELECTORAL PROCESS. SB SIX SIXTY ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE BY PROHIBITING THE PRACTICE OF PAYING SIGNATURE GATHERERS ON A PER SIGNATURE BASIS WHEN COLLECTING SIGNATURES. TO PLACE A STATE OR LOCAL INITIATIVE REFERENDUM A RECALL ON THE BALLOT. TO BE CLEAR THIS MEASURE WOULD NOT PROHIBIT PAYMENT FOR SIGNATURE GATHERING THAT IS NOT BASED ON THE NUMBER OF SIGNATURES OBTAINED SIGNATURE GATHERS COULD STILL BE PAID. AN HOURLY WAGE OR SALARY AT THE DISCRETION OF THE PROPONENT. THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE ASSURANCE AND TRANSPARENCY TO THE VOTERS AND ITS ENFORCEMENT PROVISION WILL PRINT PERMIT BOTH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. AND ANY PERSON TO BRING A CIVIL CLAIM UNDER THE SECTION FOR PERSECUTION PAYMENT PRACTICES. EMPLOYERS WHO VIOLATE THE PROVISIONS OF SB SIX SIXTY WOULD BE SUBJECT TO A FINE OF TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. OR FIFTY DOLLARS PER SIGNATURE FRAUDULENT GATHERED WHICHEVER AMOUNT IS GREATER. THIS GOOD GOVERNMENT MEASURE WILL SERVE TO STRENGTHEN OUR RECALL REFERENDUM AND INITIAL PROCESS BY ENSURING THAT VOTERS ARE AWARE OF EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE SIGNING. AND NOT BEING DECEIVED. ULTIMATELY SB SIX SIXTY WILL HELP TO RESTORE INTEGRITY AND PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN CALIFORNIA'S PROVISIONS FOR DIRECT DEMOCRACY. OTHER STATES SUCH AS COLORADO MONTANA AND OREGON HAVE ALREADY EXAMINED THE ISSUE SURROUNDING PAID SIGNATURE GATHERS AND ADOPTED LEGISLATION PROHIBITING PERSON SHOULD DOWNEY PAYMENTS. REQUIRING INSTEAD THAT PAYMENT FOR SIGNATURE GATHERING MAY ONLY BE MADE ON AN HOURLY OR SALARIED BASIS. IT'S TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO DO THE SAME. OUR DEMOCRACY AND OUR GOVERNMENTS WILL BE THE BETTER FOR IT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THIS AFTERNOON. THANK YOU CENTER NEWMAN- STAND THERE ARE NO PRIMER WITNESSES THAT IS ADDRESS IT.

ALL RIGHT I SEE LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE FLOOR I SEE SIR WHAT COUNTS HIS MICROPHONE IS OFFICER ONE CASKEY MESSAGER HAVE TWO QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR ONE NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT I HAVE VOTED FOR THESE BILLS- IN THE PAST. AS A LEGISLATOR GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER GOVERNOR BROWN AND GOVERNOR FEET- NEWMAN OUR NEW SOME HAVE SUB PRESCIENT GO AHEAD OF. YOU HAVE A- DETAILED MEASURES PREVIOUSLY PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND SHOWING THEIR RELUCTANCE TO. ERECT BARRIERS TO CITIZENS PARTICIPATION I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE AUTHORS- RESPONSE TO HIS SIDE. THE EXERCISE IN FACT NOT SATISFYING THE GOVERNOR. BUT IT'S A NEWMAN AND THANK YOU MR SENT AWAY BECAUSE HE- AS YOU NOTED SIMILAR BILLS HAVE BEEN FEATURED IN THE PAST THE VETO MESSAGES TYPICALLY- HAVE- SURE FOCUSED ON ON ONE OF TWO POINT. ONE WAS GONNA AND YOU'VE HEARD I FOR THIS ANY OPPOSITION TO ALL THAT THERE IS INSUFFICIENT DOCUMENTATION OF FRAUD WITHIN THE- THE IN A PAPER SIGNATURE- BUT PROCESS- WHICH- UNFORTUNATELY IS THE CASE- BUT ONLY INSOFAR AS IT'S VERY HARD UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM. TO INSTIGATE PROSECUTION OR ANY OTHER ACTION AGAINST A FRAUDULENT SIGNATURE GATHERING PRODUCT OF PRACTICES THAT THE SECOND. AND PROBABLY MORE COMMONLY REFERENCED ARGUMENT IS THAT IT WOULD RAISE THE COSTS. OF DIRECT DMOCRACY BY LIMITING THIS PARTICULAR PRODUCT PROCESS WHICH IS REGARDED AS MORE EFFICIENT AND THEREFORE MORE COST EFFECTIVE THAN OTHERS. AND I WOULD POINT OUT A COUPLE THINGS ONE IS. THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE FRAMERS ACTUALLY DID NOT CONSIDER COST. AS A AS A METRIC OR BASIS FOR VALIDATING AND AFTER IT WAS WITH THE YOU KNOW THEY ESTABLISHED. UNDER THE PROVISIONS FOR THE RECALL INITIATIVE THE REFERENDUM EIGHT TO LIVE REALLY RIGOROUS THRESHOLD OF SIGNATURES OR SHARE OF THE BRITISH FOR ELECTRIC THE PRIOR ELECTION. AND IF YOU COULD SECURE THOSE. IF OU COULD MEET THAT THRESHOLD IT WAS VIEWED AS VALIDATION OF THE JSON LEGITIMACY AND VALUE OF AN EFFORT. AT NO TIME IN NINETEEN TWELVE TODAY ANTICIPATE THE CHANGES WHICH WERE TO COME UP AND IN PARTICULAR THE ABILITY TO RAISE MONEY TO DO SO DIGITALLY- AND THEN TO HIRE SPECIALIZED FIRMS THAT. HAD EXPERTISE. AND HIGHLY TRAINED PERSONNEL IN THE CONDUCT OF THESE EFFORTS. AND SO. THE INCENTIVES THAT THE SYSTEM CREATES FAR CLEARLY DISTORT IF I THINK ANYBODY WHO HAS ENCOUNTERED A SIGNATURE GATHER IN FRONT OF YOUR LOCAL GROCERY STORE AS HAD SOME EXPERIENCE OF KIND OF THAT THE THREE CARD MONTE- OF HAVING PETITIONS PRESENTED TO YOU EXPLAINED IN A VERY QUICK WAY PLEASE SIMPLY SON. AND THE REASON IT'S DONE THAT WAY IS BECAUSE THE- PRACTITIONERS GET PAID PER SIGNATURE. AND THE BEST MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO OPTIMIZE THEIR YIELD. IS TO TALK QUICKLY INTO SAY WHATEVER IT TAKES FOR YOU AS- A CITIZEN CROSSING THEIR PATHS TO SIGN. AND SUBMIT THE YOU KNOW THAT THIS ARGUMENT THAT YOU KNOW IT'S SOMEHOW THAT THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND THEREFORE THE FAIREST WAY TO DO THIS. I WOULD ARGUE IS FLAWED AND I THINK IT'S PROOF OF THAT- I WILL CITE. A PARTICULAR EFFORTS OF THE- EFFORT THAT ACTUALLY SUCCEEDED IN GETTING PROP TWENTY FOUR. ON THE LAST BALLOT I THINK IT'S VERY TELLING THEM INSTANTLY A GENTLEMAN NAMED ALASTAIR MACTAGGART. WHO'S A REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER BASED IN SAN FRANCISCO. FILED A BALLOT INITIATIVE THAT HE CONTRIBUTE FREE MILLION DOLLARS WHICH SPENT A TOTAL OF ONE POINT SIX THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO COLLECT SIGNATURES THAT THEY CAME DOWN TO FOUR DOLLARS AND FORTY SIX. CENTS PER REQUIRED SIGNATURE AND IN SO DOING HE WAS ABLE TO LEVERAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO NEGOTIATE WITH HIM DIRECTLY- AND TO PUT THE PROPOSITION ON THE BALLOT. AND IT IS EXPECTED THE CHANGE CALIFORNIA PRIVACY LAWS UNDER THREAT OF THE USE OF MONEY. TO EXPLOIT THESE CONSTITUTION REVISIONS WHICH IN NO TIME ANTICIPATED ANY OF THIS. THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION YOU KNOW WHY HAVE PREVIOUS GOVERNOR'S. VETO THE BILL- I DON'T KNOW THE DATE FULLY CONSIDERED. THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS PRACTICE. AND I THINK OVER TIME YOU KNOW DATING BACK TO SENDER LANDAU UP THROUGH THE MOST RECENT EFFORTS I THINK THE NET IMPACT OF THIS PRACTICE HAS BECOME CLEAR OVER TIME. AS WE BECOME MORE AWARE OF THE ABUSES THAT THIS PRACTICE TENDS TO ELICIT. THE SECOND QUESTION IS CHAIR ALL RIGHT BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A CLUSTER OF PEOPLE THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THIS HIGH PAYING FOR VALUE BUT- YOU KNOW THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS IS SUPPOSED TO THE BILL BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE EVEN AT THE LOWER LEVEL. IT WILL HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT ON DIRECT DEMOCRACY AND IF THE AUTHOR COULD. COMMENT ON THAT I MEAN THEY THEY INDICATED THEY DON'T HAVE ANY. DIRECT EVIDENCE OF SEVERE FRAUD OR HOWEVER THEY FREE THE FREE STEP BUT BUT ON THE JUST THE- GARDEN VARIETY SORT OF RECALL INITIATIVE ON A LOCAL LEVEL DATE. OR NOT THEY'RE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE CHILLING EFFECT VERSUS THE HIGH PAID YOU KNOW STATEWIDE ISSUES H. I. I. I'M SORRY BUT I'M NOT SURE WHAT WHAT YOU'RE. DESCRIBING WHEN YOU WHEN YOU FOR THE CHILLING EFFECT. WELL THE LEAD BELIEVES THAT IMPEDING COMPENSATION FOR SIGNATURE GATHERERS FOR A REFERENDUM A RECALL OR INITIATIVE. COULD INTERFERE WITH AND HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT ON THE CITIZENS RIGHTS OF DIRECT LEGISLATION THROUGH THE INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM PROCESS AGAIN AND I DO APPRECIATE THAT SO. THAT TO BE CLEAR THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME MISREPRESENTATION RECENTLY AS TO THE- MECHANICS OF THIS BILL. THIS BILL WOULD NOT PROHIBIT THE PAYMENT OF SIX AGO. IT THAT FIGURES TO BE PAID ON AN HOURLY OR SOME OTHER BASIS YOU KNOW NON COMMISSIONER NON INCENTIVIZE BASIS. TO WHATEVER EXTENT THE PROPONENTS FEELS USEFUL AND EFFECTIVE IN ACHIEVING THEIR GOALS. WHAT IT ENDEAVORS TO DO IS TO REMOVE THOSE. THOSE PERVERSE INCENTIVES THAT I REFERRED TO EARLIER. AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT OBSERVE IN RESPONSE TO THE LEAGUE'S COMPANIONSHIP COMPLAINT- THE OPPOSITE MIGHT BE TRUE. THAT THE VALIDATION OF AN EFFORT TO PUT SOMETHING ON THE BALLOT AT WHATEVER LEVEL. IS MOST CREDIBLE BUT WHEN THE PEOPLE INVOLVED ARE DOING IT FOR THE RIGHT REASONS IN THE RIGHT WAY. AND SO YOU KNOW I I'M AGAIN. THAT THERE WAS A CALLER WHO WHO. DESCRIBED THIS IS ANTI CAPITALIST IT'S NO SUCH THING. AGAIN THAT PROPONENTS COULD PACING SHE GOES ANYWAY WHAT WE WANNA DO IS ENSURE GOOD ACTORS. AND TRANSPARENCY AND INTEGRITY IN THAT REALLY. TRUE TO OF COURSE THE SECTIONS IN A. THANK YOU. BEING ANYONE ELSE I SEE NO OTHER MICRO THREE IS THERE MOTION SIR WHAT MOVES BILL SIR NEWMAN CLOSE AGAIN IN A THANK YOU MISTER SHE SO AS OF MAY- OTHER STATES HAVE SIMILAR EXAMINE THE IS YOU'RE PAGE FIGURE.

YOU'D BE HEARING ON A- ON A COMMITTEE DAY. BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALL THE WORK THAT'S GONE INTO THIS ON AGAIN EXCEPT THE AMENDMENTS. AND I'M HERE TODAY PRESENT SB THREE EIGHTY A BILL THAT WILL MAKE SOME REVISIONS. TO THE END OF LIFE OPTION ACT THAT WAS AUTHORED. IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN I WENT INTO THE- INTO EFFECT IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. SINCE INITIAL PASSAGE OF THIS BILL AS AS I COMMITTED I'VE HAD. AT LEAST TWO OVERSIGHT HEARINGS AND HEARD FROM. THE INPUT FROM. DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THAT PROVIDERS HOSPITALS PATIENTS FAMILIES AND MORE. AND THROUGHOUT THOSE HEARINGS WE DID FIND SOME THINGS THAT NEEDED TO BE UPDATED AND ADJUSTED. AND SO AFTER FIVE YEARS OF IMPLEMENTATION THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE TODAY TO DO- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS BET WAS CONSISTENTLY IN IN COMING UP WAS THE ISSUE OF SOMETIMES THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TIME BETWEEN THAT INITIAL ASK. AND WHEN THE PATIENTS ACTUALLY ABLE TO. UTILIZE AT THE ACT- STAY FROM KAISER PERMANENTE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SHOWS THAT ABOUT APPROXIMATELY ONE THIRD OF TERMINALLY ILL PATIENTS TO REQUEST THE AID IN DYING. BEFORE IT DIES BEFORE COMPLETING THE TIME CONSUMING PROCESS WHICH INCLUDES A FIFTEEN DAY PERIOD- IN TWENTY NINETEEN. OREGON THE STATE OF OREGON WHICH HAS OVER TWENTY YEARS OF HAVING THIS IN EFFECT. AUTHORIZED A WAIVER OF THE FIFTEEN DAY WAITING PERIOD BETWEEN ORAL REQUEST TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE- AND IN NEW MEXICO ALSO JUST REDUCE THEIR WAITING PERIOD TO TWENTY EIGHT TO ADD FORTY EIGHT HOURS. AND THIS IS OFTENTIMES A REAL. MAKE THE ASK TO THEIR INITIAL PHYSICIAN THE INITIAL ATTENDING PHYSICIAN THINKING THAT PERSON IS GOING TO. PARTICIPATE THAT PERSON AND SAYS NO THEY DON'T HAVE TO TRY TO FIND SOMEBODYELSE TO DO THAT INITIAL ACT OF. THAT SOMETIMES TAKES A WHILE AND THEN TO WAIT AN ADDITIONAL FIFTEEN DAYS BEFORE THE FIND SOMEBODY ELSE. TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH. AND DURING THAT TIME BECAUSE THIS THIS BILL BACK TO REQUIRES THE PERSON SELF ADMINISTER. SOMETIMES THAT TIME THEY HAVE LOST THEIR BILLY TO SWALLOW. TO THEIR HAND TO MOUTHS. WERE VARIETY OTHER THING I CAN PER. THEM FROM BEING ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THE LAW. AS AS IT IS WRITTEN- SO WE BELIEVE THAT FIFTEEN DAY WAITING PERIOD IF CAN CAN BE WAIVED. AND THAT IS WE'RE SUGGESTING TO MOVE THAT TO FORTY EIGHT HOURS INSTEAD- THERE'S NO NEED FOR PEOPLE TO SUFFER- NEED LISTING DURING THAT TIME- ED. CURRENTLY ANOTHER ISSUE AT THE END OF LIFE OPTION ACT IS THE PHYSICIAN NEEDS TO REMIND THEM THE PERSON THAT THEY MAY NOT TAKE IT AT A PUBLIC SETTING SOMETIMES THIS PREVENTS CONFUSION FOR HOSPITALS OR OTHER HEALTH PROVIDER FOR BUSINESS BECAUSE NOT IT SHOULDN'T JUST BE OUTSIDE- BUT CERTAINLY HEALTH CARE STANDARDS SETTING IS ALL RIGHT IF THAT HEALTHCARE SETTING PARTICIPATES IN THE MEDICAL AID IN DYING NOTHING IN THIS CHANGE- SAYS THAT THE OF A HEALTH CARE FACILITY MUST PARTICIPATE BUT REDUCING THAT THE WITH THE PHYSICIAN DOESN'T NEED TO CONTINUE TO SAY THAT- AS- THIS BILL WILL ALSO REQUIRE THAT THE DATE OF ALL ORAL AND WRITTEN REQUEST MUST BE DOCUMENTED. ENSURING THAT TIME WE ASK ACCESS SO THE PERSON PASSED OFTENTIMES MISADVENTURE THAT'S NOT DOCUMENTED SO THEN THERE BECOMES A QUESTION WHEN DID THAT FIFTEEN DAYS ACTUALLY START SO THIS SAYS A POSITION MUST DOCUMENT AT THAT TIME IF THEY ARE NOT GOING TO PARTICIPATE- THEN THEY DOCUMENT THAT AND THEN TRANSFER THE PATIENT'S RECORDS IMMEDIATELY UPON REQUEST AND FINALLY THIS BILL WILL ALSO REPEAL THE SUNSET DATE AGAIN THIS HAS BEEN IN- IN EXISTENCE NOW IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OVER FIVE YEARS WITH- ABOUT TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE UTILIZED IT SO AS WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE IT'S A VERY SMALL IT IS VERY- TARGETED- BUT WE ALSO KNOW. THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO GET THE PRESCRIPTION NEVER EVEN GO THROUGH AND TAKE IT AT THE END OF HAVING THAT PRESCRIPTION THERE THAT PROVIDES THEM THE PEACE OF MIND. THAT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO DIE PEACEFULLY AGAIN NOT EVERYBODY IS GOING TO UTILIZE THIS BUT FOR PEOPLE WHO DO. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS AND THAT THE BARRIERS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. HAVE BEEN REMOVED. THANK YOU SAID I CAN ESTIMATE DR CHANDANA- BOB BANERJEE AND JULIUS TRIAL.

DOCTORS TOLD US THAT HIS COURSE UNDER. BUT THAT HE MIGHT EXPERIENCE EXCRUCIATING HEADACHES SEIZURES PARALYSIS LOSING THE ABILITY TO SPEAK OR SWALLOW AND MOST IMPORTANT TO MY DAD LOSING THE ABILITY TO THINK. MY FATHER SAID THAT HE HAD NO INTEREST IN THE LONGEVITY OF HIS LIFE INDEPENDENT OF THE QUALITY OF THAT LIFE SO AS SOON AS HE ENTERED OFFICE HE PURSUED THE OPTION OF MEDICAL AID IN DYING. THE FIFTEEN DAY WAITING PERIOD CREATED NEEDLESS SUFFERING FOR MY DAD AT AN ALREADY IMPOSSIBLE TIME IN HIS LIFE. GOOD CONDITION WAS RAPIDLY DETERIORATING AND HE WORRIED EVERY SINGLE DAY ALL DAY ABOUT WHETHER HE WOULD LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO GET THE MEDICATION OR IF HE WOULD STILL BE CAPABLE OF TAKING IT ONCE IT ARRIVED. WHEN THE MEDICATION FINALLY ARRIVED IT BROUGHT TREMENDOUS RELIEF TO MY FATHER IT EMPOWERED HIM TO REFLECT ON AND EXPRESS HIS WHICH IS ABOUT HIS DEATH. LUCKILY HE DID NOT EXPERIENCE THE PAIN NAUSEA OR SEIZURES OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH BRAIN CANCER. AND ULTIMATELY HE DID NOT INGEST THE AID IN DYING MEDICATION HE DIED PEACEFULLY THE WAY HE WANTED SURROUNDED BY FAMILY. EVEN THOUGH HE DIDN'T TAKE THE MEDICATION THE PRESIDENT OF THE MEDICATION AND THE OPTION TO TAKE IT WITH HIM PIECE OF MIND IT ALLEVIATED HIS FEAR AND ANXIETY ABOUT THE PAIN AND SUFFERING IF YOU WOULD BE FORCED TO INTO WORK WITHOUT IT.

ALL RIGHTY- LET'S NOT TURNED OPPOSITION I UNDERSTAND THAT- MISS MARYLAND GOLD FROM THE DISABILITY RIGHTS EDUCATION DEFENSE ONE IS ONLINE OPPOSITION. YES I'M HERE. THANK YOU MISS COLD CLIMATE. YEAH THANK YOU. WELL IT'S PAST SUPPORTERS POINTED TO THESE PROVISIONS AS A CENTRAL PARTS TO ENSURE THAT PATIENTS ARE PROTECTED WHY ARE THESE SO CALLED SAFEGUARDS NOW EXPANDABLE WHERE THEY ACTUALLY PERHAPS NOT THE CENTRAL LET'S START WITH THE REMOVAL OF THE SUNSET PROVISION THE BILL'S AUTHORS HAD INCLUDED IT SHOWS THAT THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE COULD HAVE ALL SIDES CLOSELY EXAMINED THE DATA REPORTED BY THE STATE. NOW FIVE YEARS PREMATURE THIS BILL SEEKS TO ELIMINATE THAT PROVISION. AND THAT REVIEW. LET US CONSIDER THE SHOT STATE CALIFORNIANS GATHERING AND REPORTING. THERE'S NO INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT PATIENTS BONUSES EVEN MORE UNLIKE IN OTHER STATES WHERE THIS IS LEGAL. THERE ARE NO STATISTICS ABOUT REFERRALS FROM FOUGHT FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATIONS UNLIKE IN OTHER SEARCH STAGE THERE ARE NO REASONS FOR PATIENTS GAS REQUEST UNLIKE. SIMILAR STATES ELSEWHERE. THERE IS NO DATA ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AFTER INGESTION SUCH AS HOW WANTED TO CHECK FOR THE LETHAL DOSE THE CARBON CONSCIOUSNESS AND DEATH. AND THE PATIENT EXPERIENCE ANY COMPLICATIONS SUCH AS REGURGITATION OR HUGE SERVICE FOR WAKING UP INSTEAD OF DYING ALL OF WHICH HAVE COME TO LIGHT IN OTHER STATES. NOW IT IS NOT WE THESE THINGS DIDN'T HAPPEN. IT'S THAT EITHER WE HAVE NOT ASKED IF THEY HAPPEN. DO WE NOT CARE IF THEY HAPPEN MY ORGANIZATION CARES FOR WE DID ASK WITH THE ANSWERS AREN'T MADE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE. SURE THERE NO ONE IS REQUIRED TO BE PRESENT AT THE TIME OF INGESTION NOT THE PRESCRIBING DOCTOR NOR ANY OBJECTIVE WITNESS WHO COULD REPORT BACK TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. SO THERE'S NO WAY TO KNOW WHAT OCCURRED. MOST EGREGIOUS CALIFORNIA HAS ADMITTED TO ARBITRARY DESTRUCTION OF THE UNDERLYING DATA EVERY THREE YEARS. BUT THE ONE INFORMATIONAL HEARING IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH REVEALED THAT THE DATA COLLECTION THE STATE DOES TWO SHOWS A LACK OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW. BUT THAT THE STATE HAS NO ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. HOW CAN CALIFORNIA REMOVES THE SUNSET CLAUSE WHILE NORRINGTON SHOWN MUCH CRUCIAL DATA. WHICH IRRESPONSIBLE OF THE LEGISLATURE TO REMOVE THE SUNSET PROVISION WITH NO REAL INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS. ALSO LOOK TO THE FIFTEEN DAY COOLING OFF PERIOD THAT IS BEING REMOVED I'M A MEDICAL STUDY IN THE LANCET JOURNAL FOUND THAT PATIENTS WILL TO LIVE AND FLUCTUATE 30% IN A TWELVE HOUR PERIOD. MANY PEOPLE REQUESTING ASSISTED SUICIDE IN FACT CHANGE THEIR MINDS SHANDONG LIVING DECADES BEYOND THEIR PROGNOSIS. A BAD DAY SHOULD NOT MEAN A DEATH SENTENCE A FEW HOURS LATER. AND ONE MORE TIME. THE KEY ISSUE OF SYSTEMIC INEQUITY IMPASSIONED CHOICES- SO MANY PROPONENTS OF THIS KIND OF BILL ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND IT WAS JUST TESTIFIED OR GIVING THEIR MEET YOU ALSO HAS BEEN CALLING ON CALIFORNIA LAWMAKERS TO PERMANENTLY RE AUTHORIZ THE LAW CHANGES TO REMOVE SO CALLED BARRIERS ESPECIALLY FOR QUOTES UNDERSERVED ETHNIC RACIALLY DIVERSE AND RURAL COMMUNITIES. SHOULD WE BE MORE WORRIED THAT THESE COMMUNITIES LAUGHTER EVEN BASIC PRIMARY CARE NOT TO MENTION SPECIALIZED CARE SUCH AS CANCER CARE PALLIATIVE CARE AND HOSPICE CARE RATHER THAN SHORT CUTTING PRIORITY ACCESS TO LEGAL DRUGS- I THANK YOU- AND I MARILYN GOLDEN WITH THE DISABILITY RGHTS EDUCATION AND DEFENSE FUND.

I'M GONNA BE GIVEN OF A SIGNAL TO WAIT YEP. WHAT. OKAY- ALL RIGHT- I UNDERSTAND CENTER COME ARE YOU GONNA LEAVE FOR A MOMENT OF WILL WILL WAIT JUST A MINUTE OKAY. ALL RIGHT HERE WE GO. SENATE KAMLAGER WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THE FLOOR'S YOURS. PERFECT WELL. GOOD AFTERNOON AND- MUCH APPRECIATED FOR THAT ACCOMMODATION MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I AM. HERE TO ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB. SIX FOUR TWO THE PATIENTS OVER PROFITS ACT. SB SIX FOUR TWO WILL PROTECT PATIENTS MEDICAL DECISIONS BY PREVENTING PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS HEALTHCARE FACILITIES. OR ANY OTHER ENTITY THAT IS NOT LICENSED TO PRACTICE MEDICINE FROM INTERFERING CONTROLLING. OR OTHERWISE LIMITING A PATIENT'S MEDICAL CARE FOR NON MEDICAL REASONS. THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM HAS SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED IN THE PAST FEW DECADES ONE TREND THAT HAS IMPACTED PATIENT CARE. IS THE RAPID PACE OF MERGERS AFFILIATIONS IN ACQUISITIONS. THESE TRANSACTIONS GIVE COMPANIES TREMENDOUS POWER TO DICTATE PATIENT CARE. EVEN IF THEIR MOTIVES ARE PROFIT DRIVEN AND DISCRIMINATORY. FOR EXAMPLE CEOS CAN IMPOSE POLICIES THAT PROHIBIT PHYSICIANS FROM DELIVERING EVIDENCE BASED CARE TO PATIENTS EVEN WHEN THEIR HEALTHCARE FACILITIES ARE EQUIPPED AND STAFFED TO DELIVER THESE SERVICES. THIS IS ESPECIALLY DANGEROUS IN URGENT AND EMERGENCY SITUATIONS BECAUSE FOR SO MANY PATIENTS LIVING IN RURAL AREAS THERE ARE SIMPLY NO OTHER OPTIONS FOR RECEIVING CARE. DESPITE THIS FACT AN INCREASING NUMBER OF HEALTH CARE FACILITIES ARE RESTRICTING THE TYPES OF CARE AVAILABLE ON THEIR PREMISES. RESTRICTIONS ARE NOT EVIDENCE BASED MORE GROUNDED IN MEDICAL SCIENCE. PUT PATIENTS LIVES AT RISK AND SHOULD HAVE NO PLACE IN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. TO MAXIMIZE PROFITS COMPANIES OFTEN CUT UNPROFITABLE MEDICAL PROCEDURES THAT BILLING QUOTAS REQUIRE INTERNAL REFERRALSFOR MEDICAL SERVICES AND PRESSURE PROVIDERS TO PERFORM UNNECESSARY BUT LUCRATIVE PROCEDURES. AT TWENTY EIGHTEEN STUDY OF TWO MILLION CARDIAC PATIENTS FOUND THAT THOSE TREATED IN CONSOLIDATED HOSPITALS WERE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE HEART ATTACKS VISIT THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. BE READMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL OR DIE. THROUGH THESE STRATEGIES MERGERS HAVE INCREASED THE PRICE OF HOSPITAL SERVICES BY UP 218% IN RECENT YEARS. KEEPING MEDICAL CARE OUT OF REACH FOR SO MANY PATIENTS AND STRAINING OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS. CALIFORNIA BANNED THE CORPORATE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE FOR THIS PURPOSE. TO ENSURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE UNTRAINED IN MEDICINE DO NOT INTERFERE WITH THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE THE PHYSICIAN PATIENT RELATIONSHIP. NOR PREVENT ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CARE. A PATIENT'S DECISION TO RECEIVE MEDICAL CARE FALLS WITHIN THE GAMUT OF THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE AND IS ACCORDINGLY GIVEN ALL THE RESPECT PRIVILEGES AND PROTECTIONS OF THE PROFESSION STEMMING FROM THE PHYSICIAN'S HIPPOCRATIC OATH. CALIFORNIA LAW ALSO EXTENDS TO THAT DECISION A HOST OF LEGAL PROTECTIONS. DESIGNED TO PREVENT UNDUE INTERFERENCE IN THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. DUE TO IMPROPER MOTIVES INCLUDING DISCRIMINATION AND PROFITEERING. AND HOSPITALS CALIFORNIA ALSO REQUIRES AND POLICIES AFFECTING PATIENT CARE INVOLVED THE HOSPITAL'S MEDICAL STAFF WHICH LEGALLY MUST BE SELF GOVERNING. THIS BILL WILL STRENGTHEN THESE PROTECTIONS TO ENSURE THAT ALL PATIENTS. REGARDLESS OF IDENTITY OR FINANCIAL STATUS CAN ACCESS AFFORDABLE COMPREHENSIVE AND INCLUSIVE MEDICAL CARE BASED ON MEDICAL CRITERIA ALONE. I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF SB SIX FOUR TWO TODAY AND HERE WITH ME TO TESTIFY IS DAVID CARILLO WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION CENTER AND FRANCISO SILVA WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION MISTER CHAIR I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU CENTER CONLOGUE OR MISTER CARILLO ON IF YOU'RE ON THE LINE PLEASE PROCEED. FINALLY HEARING. YES WE CAN. GREAT THANK YOU AB CREO CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION CENTER IN SUPPORT TO THE HONORABLE COMMITTEE. UNDER CURRENT LAW CALIFORNIA AND FEDERAL COURTS WILL APPLY TO DISTINCT ANALYSES TO SB SIX POINT TWO TO DETERMINE WHETHER EXCESSIVELY RESTRICTS RELIGIOUS LIBERTY UNDER CALIFORNIA AND FEDERAL CONSTITUTION. OF COURSE THAT'S WHAT THE LAW IS A PATIENT NEUTRAL PLEASE CONTACT THE PROPER STUDENTS. SUBJECT STAVING. IF IT IS WITHIN THE LOGS ON THE- BY A RASH PURPOSE EVEN IF IT INTERNET BIRDS LIBERTY TO SOME DEGREE. SB SIX FORTY TWO INSPIRATION NEUTRAL IT DOES NOT TARGET FOR DISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT. INSTEAD IT ADDRESSES THE MATTER THE STATE IS FREE TO REGULATE MEDICAL SERVICES TO THE PUBLIC AND IT SERVES A RATIONAL STATE INTEREST BARRING CORPORATE. INTERFERENCE IN MEDICAL DECISIONS. WHAT INTENTIONALLY BECAUSE THE REST OF THE BALANCE. THE REGULATE NON. MEDICAL SERVICES AND IT APPLIES NEUTRALLY GENERALLY COME MEDICAL. OR OF THE PHILLY. OR ABSENCE. AT MOST OF MIGHT CONFLICT WITH RELIGIOUS BELIEFS ONLY INCIDENTALLY. ALSO NINETY NOT DIRECTLY PROVIDING THE SERVICE ISSUE A DOCTOR IS. AND THE PATIENT IS THE ULTIMATE BENEFICIARY. IF THE COURT FINDS SB SIX FORTY IS NOT OFFICIALLY. OR THAT IT UNDER BURKE RELIGIOUS LIBERTY COURT WILL STRICT. EVEN SO THIS LAW SHOULD PASS MUSTER. NEARLY TABLE TO CHEAT A COMPELLING STATE INTEREST THE CIVIC. ENDING ACCESS TO CARE DISCRIMINATION FOR PATIENTS AND PROTECTED CLASS. WASHINGTON STRICT SCRUTINY AND WHICH FOR ME OF ITS IT GOT AND- THE CALIFORNIA COURT HELD ENDING THE- BASED ON GENDER OR OTHER PROTECTED CLASSIFICATIONS IS A COMPELLING STATE INTEREST. LIKE OTHER OSWALD EIGHTEEN TO ENDING SUCH DISCRIMINATION DISPATCHING TROOPS PASS TRICKS REMARKS. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THE TO THE NEUTRAL MALL GENERAL APPLICATION INTENDED TO COMBAT THE NILE MEDICAL MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE FOR NON MEDICAL REASONS SPECIFICALLY PROFIT AND DISCRIMINATION. AND THAT OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT REGULATION EVEN IF SOME INTERNAL BURDEN ON WHICH RESULT. THANK YOU AND I HAVE FURTHER. THANK YOU. MR SILVA HERE OF. THE FLOOR IS YOURS. SO YES THANK YOU CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN. THANK YOU ARE AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS GOING TO SCHOOL SO A LOT OF THE CURRENT ACCOUNTS OF THE CALIFORNIA MORE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION WHICH STRONGLY SUPPORTS SENATE BILL SIX FORTY TWO. WHAT POSITIONS HAVE SEEN IS THE INCREASING CORPORATIZATION OF HEALTHCARE. WHICH HAS RESULTED IN THE GROWTH. OF CORPORATE POLICIES. IN THE YOU'LL YOU'LL ADAM TREGIAN OF NON CLINICAL CRITERION PATIENT CARE AT THAT LIMITED ALL THE OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR PATIENTS. SB SIX FORTY TWO C. SIX TO KEEP THE- TIP THE BALANCE IN FAVOR PATIENTS TO ENSURE. PATIENTS ARE CONSIDERABLE HEALTHCARE DECISIONS AND MEDICAL DECISIONS ARE MADE. WITHOUT THE INTERFERENCE OF MOTIVES THAT HAVE NOTHING. TO DO WITH THE QUALITY OF PATIENT CARE. CALIFORNIA LAW HAS LONG TO CARDIGAN WHICH WILL NOW CLINICAL. EDUCATION CARE HOWEVER WITH THE GROWTH OF CARE MARKET CONSOLIDATION THERE HAS BEEN A GROWING EFFORT BY COMPANIES THE TOP POLICIES THAT INTERFERE WITH. THE STATE AND RESTRICT THE PATIENT'S MEDICAL CARE. SB SIX FORTY TWO CORRECT SUCH PRACTICES BY PROHIBITING. HEALTHCARE FACILITIES FROM UNILATERALLY ADOPTING POLICIES THAT IGNORE THE MEDICAL STAFF'S PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY. ON ISSUES OF PATIENT CARE. THIS APPROACH CORRECTIVE THE IMPORTANCE OF SHARED GOVERNMENT'S AMONG THE HOSPITAL'S GOVERNING BOARD AND ITS INDEPENDENT MEDICAL STAFF ENSURES THAT MEDICAL CLINICAL DECISIONSARE NOT UNDULY INFLUENCED OR CONTROLLED BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE MOTIVES OR INTEREST IN THE HOSPITAL. THE COMMISSION FOR HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF SHOULD BE EMPOWERED TO PROVIDE CARE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PATIENT NOT BE PRESSURED TO PROVIDE. UNNECESSARY MEDICAL SERVICES THAT MAKE THE HOSPITAL MONEY ADDITIONALLY SB SIX FORTY TWO ADDRESSES BUSINESS PRACTICES BY PRIVATE. EQUITY INVESTMENT FIRMS THAT SEEK TO CIRCUMVENT CALIFORNIANS BANNING CORPORATE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. GRADUALLY PURSUE A RETURN ON THEIR INVESTMENT BY REDUCING CONTROLLING OR LIMITING MEDICAL DECISIONS TOO OFTEN.

HOSPITAL'S GOVERNING BODY HAS LEGAL OBLIGATIONS RESPONSIBILITIES AND THE RIGHT TO GOVERN FUNDAMENTAL ASPECTS OF THE OPERATION OF THE HOSPITAL IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTY ACCREDITATION REQUIREMENTS AND LONGSTANDING STATE AND FEDERAL LAW. THEREFORE THE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION MEXICO'S SB SIX FOUR TWO. THREE THREE FOUR TWO SIX ONE POWER INDIVIDUAL POSITIONS TO DICTATE TO A HOSPITAL WHAT TREATMENTS AND SERVICES AT THE HOSPITAL WILL OFFER. IT SEEKS TO GET EACH INDIVIDUAL POSITIONS OF POWER DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE PHYSICIANS OF NO FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY EXPOSURE FOR THE. CONSEQUENCES OF THESE DECISIONS. NOR OBLIGATION TO MANAGE THAT STUFF OR READ THAT MAY BE RE. TO EMPLOY THE VISION NO OBLIGATION CAN. OR BALANCE THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS CHOICE AGAINST THE NEEDS OF OTHER PATIENTS OR THE HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE. FOR CALIFORNIA LAW RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF THE ORGANIZED MEDICAL STAFF IN ENSURING THE ADEQUACY AND QUALITY OF THE CARE RENDERED TO PATIENTS. THE MEDICAL FACULTY CORRECTLY MADE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE GOVERNING BODY FOR THE ADEQUACY AND QUALITY OF THE CARE RENDERED TO PATIENTS. ALL THE GOVERNING BODY IS REQUIRED TO HAVE OVERALL ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY THE MEDICAL STOP WORKS OF THE GOVERNING BODY CLINICAL GUIDELINES AND THERE ARE ESTABLISHED METHODS TO RESOLVE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE TWO. SB SIX FOUR TWO COMPLEXITY FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES OF HOSPITAL GOVERNANCE. FIND ALTERNATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR HOSPITAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AS WELL AS OVERALL ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY TO THE GOVERNING BODY. MEMBERS HAVE A FIDUCIARY DUTY TO ACT IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE ORGANIZATION AND POTENTIAL PERSONAL LIABLE LIABILITY IF THEY FAIL TO DO SO. INSTEAD SB SIX FOUR TWO WOULD GRANT THE ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY TO INDIVIDUAL POSITION AND THE MEDICAL STAFF COULD NOT BEAR THE LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS OF THE HOSPITAL.

ALREADY THANK YOU THIS MODERATE ANYBODY ELSE ON THE PHONE LINE. NOTHING MORE THE POINT OF THIS TIME. ALL RIGHT LET'S TURN NOW THE CHAMBER I SEE NO MICROPHONES REYES- I'M SORRY MAJORITY LEADER HERTZBERG. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN I JUST WANTED TO. AND OBSERVATION AYE WE JUST GOT THIS BILL OF COURSE BECAUSE IT WAS GOTTEN AMENDED BECAUSE OF OUR NEW SENATOR HERE HE HAS TWO BILLS ONE THAT. I GAVE HER IN THIS NEW ONE IS GREAT AND SHE'S A FANTASTIC AUTHOR AN ECSTATIC TO HAVE HER HERE I JUST WANTED TO. HELLO JUST PUT A COUPLE OF THOUGHTS ON THE RECORD BECAUSE IT'S SO NEW. AND WHEN I WENT TO THE ANALYSIS. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE MEANING OF THIS BILL WHAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO DO. ARM DIGGING DEEP BECAUSE THE FIRST OF ALL YOU KNOW I'D WORKED ON THIS ISSUE OF CHOICE IN THE ISSUE OF HOSPITALS AND THEIR THEIR RELIGIOUS VIEWS. MANY MANY YEARS AGO AND CREATING THE CONTRACEPTIVE EQUITY ACT WHICH TOOK ME FIVE TIMES TO GET IT PASSED AND FORM THE FOUNDATION WHICH ULTIMATELY BECAME THE HOBBY LOBBY CASE. ENDS AT THE SAME TIME HAVE SEEN OVER THE MANY DECADES. THE EXTRAORDINARY. DISCUSSION AND ACTIONS BY THIS. LEGISLATIVE BODY IN THE GOVERNOR WHO REALLY TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE HOSPITAL AND A DOCTOR. AND BASICALLY WHEN YOU READ THE ANALYSIS WHICH ACCURATELY REFLECTS WHAT THE CONDITION OF THE LAW IS. IT BASICALLY SAYS DOCTORS CAN'T BE MESSED WITH THEY HAVE THEIR PROFESSIONAL OPINION. AND YOU CAN'T MAKE DECISIONS ON PROFITABILITY'S OF HOSPITALS AND THAT. BODY OF LAW IS PRETTY SIGNIFICANT. NOW WE HAVE A SERIES RECENTLY OF A BUNCH OF MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS AS WE SEEN ALL ACROSS. MANY SPECTRUMS AND WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THOSE MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS ARE. SO WHEN I READ THIS I READ THE NARAL CONSTRUCT AS IT RELATES TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE. BUT I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THE LARGER ISSUE IN TERMS OF ITS IMPACT. AND HOW YOU REALLY AS WE DEAL WITH THIS LARGER DYNAMIC AND WE DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF. WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO FOR HEALTH CARE FOR ALL OF THE LIKE HOW DO WE INTEGRATE ALL THIS AND I HAVE SOME UNDERSTANDING SO I'M GONNA VOTE FOR THIS BECAUSE- YOU KNOW. COME TO THE CONGRESS A GREAT LEGISLATOR I THINK THE WORK OF THE FOR AND SHE BY I HAD A CHACE TO TALK TO HER ABOUT IT. BUT I JUST I JUST HAVE QUESTIONS THAT WE GET A CHANCE TO TALK TO HER ABOUT IT TO TRY TO GET A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING. YOU I'M JUST CONCERNED THAT WE CONTINUALLY PUT BILLS AND BILLS AND STUFF ESPECIALLY SOMETHING AS COMPLEX AS HEALTH CARE. AND IT WORRIES ME A LITTLE BIT SO I JUST PUT THAT OUT THERE I'M GONNA VOTE FOR IT BECAUSE IT YOU KNOW I WANT TO GET A CHANCE TO WORK WITH THEIR IT'S JUST TO ME SAID GUT AND AMEND FOR. VERY LEGITIMATE REASONS AND WANTED TO ARTICULATE I THINK THE FRAMEWORK WITH WHICH WE SHOULD BE APPROACHING BY THIS MEASURE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SHERMAN FOR INDULGING ME WITH SO MUCH TIME. THANK YOU. SIR HERTZBERG A CENTER LAYER- THANK YOU MISTER. AN ACTUAL. THE SENATOR- HUH NO WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO SAY NAMES ON A GET IT THE GUY FROM NORTH HOLLYWOOD OR WORD REACH FROM- HE ACTUALLY WAS VERY PERSUASIVE BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO ASK A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR. BECAUSE THERE'S ONE PARTICULAR PROVISION THAT SEEMS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WAS TRYING TO DO LAST YEAR ABOUT APPROVING THE- THE TRANSFERABILITY OF HOUSES THAT ARE HOSPITALS AND PUTTING. THE UNREST CIVIL RIGHTS ACT IN THE MIDDLE OF IT AS A BASIS FOR- FOR CONSIDERATION OF THOSE TRANSFERS OF HOSPITALS THAT SEEMS VERY SIGNIFICANT TO ME AND SOMETHING I WOULD LIKE. A TO TALK ABOUT AND AT THE SAME TIME ON THE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION SIDE THEY'RE FEELING LIGHT THEY'RE BEING REQUIRED. TO DO SERVICES DICTATE DON'T CURRENT DO BECAUSE OF HOW THIS BILL WAS STRUCTURED AND I SORT OF. WAS PREPARED TO ENGAGE IN QUESTIONS BACK AND FORTH BUT I THINK AFTER SENATOR HERTZBERG'S COMMENTS. BOB IT'S PERSUASIVE IN THE SENSE THAT. THIS IS NEW I'VE GOTTEN AMANDA I'M PART. A FUNCTION OF THE CHANGE OF HOUSES AND I WOULD JUST SITE THOSE THINGS AS THINGS I WOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT AND WANT TO SEE MORE WE HAVE CONVERSATIONS AND FEEL LIKE I THINK THERE'S A BUNCH OF WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE ON THIS. END AND FIVE AND WOULD VOTE TO MOVE ALONG BUT WOULD CALL OUT THOSE ISSUES AS THINGS THAT I THINK ARE WORTHY OF CONVERSATIONS AND SEEING HOW THEY'RE GOING. TO BE RESOLVED AS THE BILL MOVES FOR. THANK YOU SENATOR SENT WHITE HOUSE KEEPS ME SECURE I KNOW THAT WE HAVE A- TO. ON THE LIABILITY I'D LIKE TO FOCUSING ON HE LIABILITY THE BIGGER QUESTION WILL BE. I'LL HAVE TO GO DEAL WITH THAT. THE DOCKS ARE FOR DOCTORS. IF THE LIABILITY PIECE FOR THE HOSPITALS IS. REMAINS THERE BUT THEY DON'T GET TO. MAKE DECISIONS ON WHAT PROCEDURES ARE BEING DONE. HOW WITH THE C. AUTHOR HOW IS THAT FAIR I GUESS. QUESTION A AUTHOR M. SEMICON LONGER IF YOU CARE TO ADDRESS IT NOW OUR NEW ONES. WHATEVER YOU CHOOSE. I WILL SAY VAX- THE LANGUAGE DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING ABOUT THE LIABILITY OF HOSPITALS OR MEDICAL STAFF- THE MEDICAL STAFF STILL MUST INVESTIGATE EVERY REPORT OF PHYSICIAN MISCONDUCT AND IF THEY DON'T THEN THE HOSPITAL GOVERNING BOARD MUST ACT OF COURSE IF THEY DON'T THEN THEY ARE LIABLE- AND SO THEY'RE STILL CHECKS AND BALANCES THAT REMAIN THIS BILL DOESN'T- DO ANYTHING- THAT WOULD COUNTER THAT HAVING SAID THAT WE ARE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS JUST TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE LANGUAGE IS ADEQUATELY CLARIFIED BECAUSE IT IS NOT THE INTENT- FOR THIS BILL TO HAVE ANY IMPACT ON- LIABILITY. THANK YOU BOB SAYING NO FURTHER QUESTIONS- CENTER CAMARADERIE ON. I KNOW YOU WORKED HARD ON THIS ISSUE THAN THIS IS A DIFFICULT AND DELICATE ISSUE TRYING TO BALANCE. THE HEALTHCARE INTERESTS OF PATIENTS DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS. DOCTORS OF COURSE ARE DUTY BOUND TO THINK IN TERMS THE BEST INTERESTS OF THEIR PATIENTS AND HOSPITALS. NEED TAKE A BROADER VIEW FOR ALL THEIR PATIENTS. YOU'VE HEARD. THE COMMENTS BY SEN HERTZBERG AND SENATOR LAYERED- AND I. HOPE AND TRUST THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS SO THAT- WE CAN REACH A PLACE OF GREATER EQUANIMITY I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL- BUT I DO ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH CENTER LAYERED CENTER HERTZBERG'S COMMENTS. SO IS THERE A MOTION. SIR HERTZBERG MOVES A BILL. RIGHT MEDICI COUNCIL PLEASE CALL THE ROLL THIS IS SB SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO BY SENATOR COM LOCKER WITH A MOTION BY SENATOR HERTZBERG THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON RULES- BURKE HI I'M BURKE AYE PORGES. ABIERTO. DID ASAL THE REST SO I GONZALEZ. GONZALEZ I HERTZBERG. BURGER AYE JONES LAYERED HI HILLIARD I A STERN STRIKE STERN I WAKE CAL SKI. WIECKOWSKI AYE WIENER WIENER I. THAT'S EIGHT ZERO SO FAR ALL RIGHTY WILL PUT THE BILL IN CALL. THEY SAY WELL I SEE SEVEN ACQUIRE WHO IS NEXT IN FILE ITEM. ONE ONE SECOND EVERYONE. I APOLOGIZE TO THE CALLER WOULD YOU WE TOOK THE VOTE BEFORE YOU CLOSED THE CARE TO TALK US OUT OF IT. NO I DON'T WANT ANY OF THAT BUT WHAT I WANTED TO SAY WAS I- FOR THOSE OF YOU IN THE CHAMBER AND ON THIS COMMITTEE I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I AM AN HONEST BROKER. AND I AM HAPPY TO TALK WITH EVERYONE TO ANSWER ALL QUESTIONS BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY YOU GET REAL GOOD MEANINGFUL BILLS PASSED IS BY BUILDING COALITIONS AND LISTENING TO EVERYONE TO MAKE SURE THAT SSUES ARE ADDRESSED. I WANTED TO SAY THAT OUR BILL DOES NOT FORCE THE HAND OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IT SAYS THAT THE AG SHALL CONSIDER- BUT IT DOES IT DOESN'T SAY WHAT THEY NEED TO DO WITH THE INFORMATION AND IN FACT THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING WITH THE INFORMATION IT'S STILL RECOGNIZES THAT THERE'S MEDICAL STAFF IN THE GOVERNING BODY OF HOSPITALS AND SO THERE S A SEPARATION OF DUTIES. IT DOESN'T KNOWLEDGE THAT ULTIMATELY HOSPITALS. YOU KNOW OUR RESPONSIBLE. BUT THERE ARE CLEAR DELINEATIONS ABOUT PATIENT CARE AND THE RESPONSIBILITIES FOR MEDICAL STAFF TO MAKE SURE THAT PATIENT CARE IS PROVIDED TO EVERYONE. I'M IN THE BILL IS FACIALLY NEUTRAL IN A WAY THAT IS APPLICABLE TO EVERYONE NONPROFIT FACILITIES FOR PROFIT FACILITIES EXCEPT AROUND. BUT I WANT YOU ALL TO KNOW AND I DIDN'T WANNA BE DISRESPECTFUL. THAT I'VE HEARD THE CONCERNS AND I DID TAKENOTES AND WILL BE MAKING APPOINTMENTS WITH YOUR OFFICES AND THAT THIS WILL ALSO BE BEFORE THE HEALTH COMMITTEE IN SO THERE WILL BE TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE ISSUES ARE ADDRESSED. AND ARE APPROPRIATELY ADDRESSED BEFORE OR DURING THAT COMMITTEE SO THANK YOU AND I HOPE IT'S STILL EIGHT ZERO. THANK YOU SO TO. FIND THE NEXT SENATE MCGUIRE. SENATE MCGUIRE WELCOME SB FIVE FIVE FIVE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SECURE GOOD AFTERNOON AT FIRST AND FOREMOST RESEARCHER I WANNA TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU AND YOU'RE VERY CAPABLE STAFF FOR ALL THE WORK ON THIS BILL. A GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MEMBERS LOOK FIVE FIVE FIVE IS GOING TO CREATE A NEW AND INNOVATIVE SYSTEM FOR COLLECTING AND DISPENSING REVENUE FROM TRAINS IN OCCUPANCY TAXES STATE TAXES ALSO KNOWN AS T. O. T. FOR SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS ACROSS THE GOLDEN STATE TO LOOK IN CALIFORNIA EVERY CITY EVERY COUNTY LEVY T. O. T. I. AND THAT REVENUE IS. COLLECTED TYPICALLY DO USE FOR GENERAL FUND PURPOSES IT SUPPORT FIRE AND POLICE AND PUBLIC HEALTH GOOD ROADS CITY STREETS BUT UNLIKE HOTELS AND MOTELS LOCAL JURISDICTIONS OFTEN HAVE A CHALLENGING TIME COLLECTING THAT TAX FOR SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS BECAUSE NUMBER ONE HOST THE HOMEOWNERS ARE NOT ALWAYS AWARE OF THE REQUIREMENT TO BE TO COLLECT AND REMIT THOSE TAXES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. CANDIDLY DON'T ALWAYS KNOW WHAT PROPERTIES ARE BEING USED FOR SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS THEREFORE WE BELIEVE LIKELY TENS OF MILLIONS OF NOT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN DEBT TAX REVENUE GOES UNCOLLECTED EVERY YEAR SO HERE'S WHAT THE BILL WILL DO IT'S GOING TO HELP CITIES AND COUNTIES COLLECT THIS REVENUE WHICH IS LEGALLY OWED TO THEM BY CREATING A STATEWIDE DEAD TAX COLLECTION PROGRAM THAT WOULD BE ADMINISTERED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION. FOR THOSE JURISDICTIONS WHO CHOOSE TO PARTICIPATE THIS IS VOLUNTARY IT'S AN OPT IT'S MODELED AFTER THE MARKET PLACE DISORDER ACT THAT- WE WORKED WITH THIS IN THE WOMAN BURKE ON LAST YEAR WHICH NOW COLLECTS SALES TAXES FROM. ONLINE PLATFORMS LIKE AMAZON AND WAYFAIR THIS PROGRAM FOR VACATION RENTAL PLATFORMS WOULD REQUIRE THESE PLATFORMS SUCH AS AIRBNB IN VR BO TO COLLECT THE APPROPRIATE BED TAX FROM CUSTOMERS WHEN SHORT TERM RENTALS BOOKED THROUGH THE PLATFORM THE PLATFORM WOULD THEN RE MET THE FUNDS COLLECTED BY THE CALIFORNIA. DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION. TO AT THE CITY COUNTY IT'S SIMPLE. THE PROGRAM WILL BE BALLING FOR LOCAL AGENCIES AND LOCAL AGENCIES WOULD BE REQUIRED TO ENACT AN ORDINANCE TO PARTICIPATE. THIS BILL MEMBERS THIS BILL DOES NOT PROHIBIT CITIES AND COUNTIES WHO WANT TO CONTINUE WITH THEIR OWN VOLUNTARY COLLECTION AGREEMENTS. WITH PLATFORM SO THERE ARE SEVERAL CITIES AND COUNTIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS WITH FOR EXAMPLE AIRBNB IT DOESN'T DISRUPT THOSE AGREEMENTS. THIS JUST GIVES JURISDICTIONS WHO DON'T HAVE THE VOLUNTARY COLLECTION COLLECTION AGREEMENTS WITH THE HOSTING PLATFORMS WHICH BY THE WAY IS MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA CITIES AND COUNTIES. WHO DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO CREATE THE AGREEMENTS OR HAVE EVER STRUCK ONE WITH AN ONLINE PLATFORM. SO TODAY LAYS IN GERMAN WE ARE GRATEFUL TO BE ABLE TO HAVE JEAN HURST WITH THIS. SHE'S REPRESENTING THE RULE COUNTY REPRESENTS A CALIFORNIA AND WE ALSO HAVE- THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA HISPANIC CHAMBER OF COMMERCE.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND- FIRST LET ME SAY IN PRESENTING S. B. FOUR FOUR SEVEN THAT I WOULD ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS A PLACE OF FOUR YEAR SUNSET INTO THE BILL. ARE ALSO LIKE TO THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON THE BILL LANGUAGE. CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF ONLY FIVE STATES IN THE ENTIRE NATION THAT REWARDS DEFENDANTS FOR PROLONGING COURT DOES PROCEDURES. LEAVING VICTIMS UNABLE TO OBTAIN JUSTICE SB FOUR FOUR SEVEN EXTENDS OF VICTIMS RIGHTS AND THE RIGHT OF THEIR LOVED ONES TO PURSUE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR HUMAN SUFFERING EVEN IF. THEY DIED PRIOR TO THE CASE RESOLUTION. ALL TOO OFTEN DEFENDANTS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF EXISTING LAW PROLONGING COURT PROCEEDINGS IN HOPE THOSE DELAYS WILL OUTWEIGH OF THE VICTIMS OF THEIR OWN NEGLIGENCE. COVERED NINETEEN IS HIGHLIGHTED THIS INJUSTICE IS INDIVIDUALS AND THOSE WHO WERE GRANTED A TRIAL PREFERENCE ARE UNABLE TO GET THEIR CASE IS HEARD AND RESOLVED AND MAY DIE WITHOUT EVER SEEING JUSTICE. S. B. FOUR FOUR SEVEN REFLECTS THE FACT THAT THE VICTIM SHOULD NOT SUFFER DUE TO DEFENDANTS GAMING THE SYSTEM. WHAT COVERED NINETEEN RELATED COURT PROCEDURE CLOSURES HAVE GREATLY EXACERBATED THE ISSUE THIS PROBLEM IS NOT NEW AND DEFENDANTS MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. FOR THE OPPOSITION IS ARGUING THAT WE SHOULD LIMIT THE BILL TO COVERT NINETEEN IMPACTED CASES ONLY. BY THIS PROBLEM EXISTED FOR DECADES PRIOR TO COVERT NINETEEN AND WHILE COVERED NINETEEN RELATED COURT CLOSURES HAVE GREATLY EXACERBATED THE ISSUE IT HAS LONG BEEN A TACTIC TO DELAY IT DRAG OUT CASES UNTIL VICTIMS DIE. BECAUSE THE WINDFALL THAT REDUCES ACCOUNTABILITY. THE OPPOSITION IS ALSO STATED THAT CURRENT LAW IS SUFFICIENT AND DOES NOT MERIT A CHANGE HOWEVER WE ALL AGREED THAT OUR NATION AND STATE TO THE VAULT OVER THE PAST SIXTY YEARS WHEN THIS WAS FIRST ENACTED IN THIS WAY. THE BILL CONTAINS A SUNSET- WITH THE COMMITTEE I'M AMENDMENTS THAT WILL ALLOW AMPLE TIME TO ACCEPT IT IT ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THIS CHANGE. VICTIMS AND THEIR LOVED ONES DESERVE JUSTICE TO BE SERVED WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT TODAY IS LARA HOW BENEATH AND CRISTINA SWIPE CARD- THANKS TO. THE COMMITTEE AND MEMBERS AND I RESPECTFULLY REP REQUESTED I VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER LAYERED- IF MISS ALBANY IS ON THE LINE. THE FRAZIER THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU MISTER SHARON MEMBERS MY NAME IS LAUREL ALBANY I'M A BOARD MEMBER OF THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA COSPONSORED THE BILL ALONG WITH THE CONSUMER FEDERATION CALIFORNIA. I'M HERE TODAY TO ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TO PRESERVE DAMAGES FOR HUMAN SUFFERING AND ASK YOU TO ELIMINATE THE DEATH DISCOUNT. THEY'RE REAL EXAMPLES OF HUMAN SUFFERING FROM CASES WE HAVE SEEN DURING MONTHS OF AGONIZING PAIN FROM THIRD DEGREE BURNS IN THE HOSPITAL. LOSING THE USE OF THEIR LEGS. THE DEVELOPING AN INSPECTOR'S RELATED CANCER THAT SUFFOCATE YOU WITH YOUR OWN CHEST ISSUE. KILIK MOST STATES CALIFORNIA ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THESE DAMAGES ARE REAL. AND THAT SOMEONE WHO NEGLIGENTLY CAUSES THOSE DAMAGES SHOULD COMPENSATE THE VICTIM. BUT WE ARE ONE OF A HANDFUL OF STATES THAT WIPES OUT THOSE DAMAGES WHEN THE VICTIM DIES GIVING THE PERSON WHO HARD THE DEATH DISCOUNT. THERE'S NO POLICY REASON FOR THIS ROLE THAT EXISTS BECAUSE DECADES AGO THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY LOBBIED FOR IT. THE HARDEST ON ELDERS AND CHILDREN ON STATE HOME PARENTS AND THOSE WITH DISABILITIES BECAUSE WITHOUT LOSS INCOME MOST OF THEIR DAMAGES ARE HUMAN SUFFERING DAMAGES. AND THIS CREATES A SECOND INJUSTICE WITH LAWYERS FOR NEGLIGENT DEFENDANTS HAVE AN INCENTIVE TO DELAY THESE CASES UNTIL THE VICTIM DIED. WIPING OUT HUMAN SUFFERING DAMAGES AND BENEFITING THEIR NEGLIGENT CLIENTS WITH A DENTIST CAL. THESE MONEY DRIVEN DELAYED NOT ALL HARM BUT THEY ADD TO THE ALREADY HEAVY BURDEN ON OUR COURTS AND WHILE THIS PROBLEM EXISTED BEFORE COVE IT. IT'S IMPACT IS THAT GREATLY MAGNIFIED THAT THE CODE RELATED COURT SHUT DOWN. I AM ASKING FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TO SUPPORT SENATE BILL FOUR FOUR SEVEN TO ELIMINATE THE DEATH DISCOUNT THANK YOU.

CIVIL CASES- WE HAVE GREAT SPONSORS WERE NOT ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE BILL WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC HOPEFULLY A ONCE IN A CENTURY EVENT WE'RE NOT INSENSITIVE TO THE INABILITY OF PLAINTIFFS TO GET TO TRIAL WE'RE WORKING WITH THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS TO TRY TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. BUT THIS BILL WILL CHANGE LITERALLY A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE YEARS OF CALIFORNIA LAW. WHICH WILL DRAMATICALLY EXPAND DAMAGES AVAILABLE FOR VIRTUALLY EVERY TYPE OF SUPPORT CASE IN CALIFORNIA EVEN WHERE THE PLAINTIFFS DIES- AND THE DEATH HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE UNDERLYING TORT SO IT'LL APPLY TO PERSONAL INJURY EMPLOYMENT. MALPRACTICE RITUALLY TOWARD CASE CALIFORNIA LAW OVER. THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF THE STATE HAS CAREFULLY CONSTRUCTED A TORT SYSTEM SO THAT DAMAGES ARE AVAILABLE TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO SUFFER THEM. AND WE ALLOW IN SURVIVAL ACTIONS PUNITIVE DAMAGES AS A DETERRENT WE DON'T SEE THIS AS A WINDFALL WE SEE IT AS PART OF A CAREFULLY CONSTRUCTED TOWARDS SYSTEM. NOW IT MAY BE TRUE THAT FORTY FIVE STATES ALLOW PAIN AND SUFFERING PASS YEAH. BUT WE BELIEVE FAR FEWER. STATES ALLOW PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN SURVIVAL ACTIONS WITHOUT LIMITS WE GRANT PREFERENCE DESIGNATIONS IN CERTAIN CASES TO GET PEOPLE TO TRIAL- QUICKER. WE LIMIT DEPOSITIONS TO TRY TO GET PEOPLE TO TRIAL- QUICKER AND WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE TOTALITY OF THE TORT SYSTEM- SB FOUR FOUR SEVEN WILL INCREASE DAMAGES FOR VIRTUALLY EVERY COURT CLAIM WHERE THE PLAINTIFF DIES PRIOR TO JUDGMENT. AND THAT'S TRUE OF PRIVATE AND PUBLIC DEFENDER. THIS WILL APPLY TO ACTIONS AGAINST SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CITY AND COUNTY. AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO WE'RE VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS DRAMATIC CHANGE IN THE LAW WE APPRECIATE ATTEMPTS TO NARROW THE BILL WE DON'T THINK THE FOUR YEARS SINCE THAT GETS US THERE. THE WORDING THAT WE HAVE SEEN WHAT APPLY THE SUNSET TO ALL CASES WHICH APPROVED PRIOR TO ONE ONE TWENTY SIX SO THAT EVERY EXISTING TORT CASES NOW. LET'S EVENTS THAT ARISE DURING THE FOUR YEAR PERIOD BELOW THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S OF LIMITATION. THANK YOU FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSE HI THANK YOU SIR. BOB MISS OFF. THANK YOU SO MUCH COULD MR NUMBER. MY NAME IS JAMIE AND I'M WITH WILL JOHNSON ADVOCATE HEALTH. NINETY TWO IN ORDER O ABOUT BEFORE FOR SEVEN TWO WELL WE DO HAVE GREAT RESPECT TO THE OFFER AND HIS STAFF AND APPRECIATE HIS WILLINGNESS TO AMEND THE BILL TO PLANT THAT. WE REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE COMMENDED BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THE REVISED VERSION STILL HAVE NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR CIVIL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND ULTIMATELY HURT CONSUMERS AND TAXPAYERS. CALIFORNIA HAS SOME OF THE MOST IF NOT THE MOST. CONSUMER FROM THE CIVIL COURT IN THE NATION. WE OFFER PREFERRED FILING SYSTEM FOR ELDERLY OR THOSE WITH HEALTH ISSUES TO CUT THE LINE FOR EXPEDITED TRIAL WE HAVE SHOWN. THAT DISTRICTS DEPOSITION TIME FOR ME. TO DIE ASSEMBLY DOESN'T DRAG ON WE ALLOW YOU TO DAMAGES AND SURVIVAL ACTIONS ON TOP OF% COMPENSATORY DAMAGES. AND MOST SURVIVAL ACTIONS ARE JOIN WITH THE SURVIVORS OWN LONG TOLD US ACTION WHERE SHE OR HE CAN RECOVER AND THEIR FAMILIES. THANK YOUNG AGAIN. SUPPORT AL WIRE FROM OTHER STATES IT'S BECAUSE ALL THE WAYS WE PROTECT POINT IT SHOULD BE ALREADY ALLOW FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGE RECOVERY IN SURVIVAL ACTION WE BELIEVE ADDING ANOTHER FORM OF PROJECTED DAMAGES IS EXPECTED. TO MEET EXCEPT A COUPLE OF COMMITTEE BORNE BY CONSUMERS SHOULD STILL HAVE HUGE IMPLICATIONS ACROSS ALL SECTORS OF OUR ECONOMY WILL INCREASE COSTS FOR BOTH STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHO ARE FREQUENTLY EXPOSED. INTEREST THERE. WILL BE A CRITICALLY IN AN APPALLING FOR YOUR SONS THAT YOUR MAN IS AWARDED TO APPLY DECATUR ACCRUED IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS WHICH MEANS THE BILL PLAY A KEY. STEP WILL NOT EVEN HAVE BEEN FILED BY TWENTY TWENTY SIX MAKING THE RECOVERY APPLICABLE WELL BEYOND THE SENSE THAT. OUR COALITION HAS AFTER THE BILL BE APPLIED ONLY TO THE TEACHER COULD PERSONALLY IMPACTED BY THE RECENT COURT BACKLOG WE STILL BELIEVE THAT THE BEST APPROACH ALL DONE NOT BY SAYING THAT. WE BELIEVE WELL REASONED AND LONGSTANDING PUBLIC POLICY SHOULD BE CHANGED ON A TEMPORARY AND HOPEFULLY A ONCE IN A LIFETIME SITUATION WE BELIEVE THE RIGHT PRO A RIGHT APPROACH ON THAT WOULD BE TO LIMIT THE BILL TO FOCUS ON. PERSONAL INJURY CASE- THE LADY. ASIAN TO SB FOUR FOUR SEVEN COULD QUEUE UP. AS MODERATOR WE HAVE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION TO THE SP FOUR FOUR SEVEN. YES WE HAVE FOUR IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME RT. I AM GOOD LINE FIVE SEVENTY NINE PLEASE GO AHEAD.

WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME. ALL RIGHT QUESTIONS FROM COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS I SEE NO MICROPHONES REYES- IS THERE A MOTION. SO I. CAL SCHIMEL I'M SORRY CENTER WIENER JIM QUESTION. I HAVE A STATEMENT. MEANT YEAH OKAY GOOD CENTER WE AYE I MOVE THE BILL- THE BILL- IF MY CONCERN OR BECAUSE HE IS NOT NO I SO- I COME TO THIS AS SOMEONE WHO SPENT FIFTEEN YEARS AS A DEFENSE ATTORNEY- AND I SUPPORT THIS BILL. AND I UNDERSTAND- CIVIL DEFENSE ATTORNEY- AND SO ON A ON SAW NOT JUST IN MY OWN CASES THAT I HANDLED AS DEPUTY CITY ATTORNEY DEFENDING THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO GROUNDS FOR LAWSUITS- BUT ALSO IN OBSERVING OTHER LAWSUITS FRANKLY ARBITRARY NATURE OF THIS CUT OFF. AND THE FACT THAT YOU WOULD HAVE A SITUATION WHERE SOMEONE HAPPEN TO PASS AWAY IT WOULD DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE MONETARY VALUE OF DAMAGES- ON OF THAT- OF THAT CASE AND THAT WHICH IS IN FACT EVERYTHING IN TERMS OF THE NEGOTIATIONS. AND SO I THINK- IT IS ARBITRARY AND NUTS WILL HAVE A FEW STATES HAVE THIS RULE- AND I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO KEEP. IN MIND. THAT THE SUFFERED THE NONAKA DAMAGE RUN THROUGH THE DAY OF THE- AND ARE CUT OFF. SO IT'S STILL THE CASE THAT IF SOMEONE LET'S SAY HAS A HORRIBLE- INJURY AND AS A- QUADRIPLEGIC OR A SERIOUS BRAIN INJURY AND IS TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OLD AND IS ANTICIPATED TO LIVE FOR ANOTHER. FORTY OR FIFTY YEARS THAT PERSON IS GONNA GET DRAMATICALLY MORE IN TERMS OF PAIN AND SUFFERING NON ECONOMIC DAMAGES THAN SOMEONE WHO IS INJURED. AND DIES ONE YEAR LATER FROM THOSE INJURIES SO THIS IS NOT THE CASE OVER TO US THIS OPENING UP THE DOORS AND YOU CAN AWARD WHATEVER YOU WANTS. ON IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF SUBJECTIVITY IN TERMS OF WHAT THE JURY AWARDS- BY IN MY EXPERIENCE JURIES ARE. I AM AS A TRIAL ATTORNEY TRIED A NUMBER OF CASES AND ON SEVERAL CONTACTS OR CASES. JURIES WERE PRETTY- LISTEN TO THE EVIDENCE CLOSELY AND I THINK GENERALLY DID A REALLY GOOD JOB AND ASSESS DAMAGE AS WELL SO THIS IS A LONG OVERDUE- CHANGE SOME OF MY FORMER COLLEAGUES ARE PROBABLY GONE- I'M TRYING TO GET SOME PHONE CALLS ABOUT THIS ABOUT YOU KNOW AS A AS- A AS A FORMER. DEFENSE ATTORNEY BUT I GOT TO SEE I THINK ALL SIDES OF THIS AND THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CHANGE AND I SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU SIR WIENER- IT'S BEEN MOVED BY CENTER WIENER ANY OTHER COMMENTS NO NO OTHER COMMENTS ALL RIGHT. EARLIER THE CUTICLES I THINK THAT THE BOTH THE MISSUS WHITE CARD AND SENATOR WIENER DID A GREAT JOB OF. OF MAKING MY CLOTHES AND I JUST APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY AND ALL SIDES. I THINK THIS IS IT IS POWERFUL AND I THINK THE ONE THING THAT THE COMMITTEE DID IS WHILE I DO NOT THINK THE OPPOSITION ARE. ARGUMENTS HAVE. AS MUCH MERIT AS THOSE THAT SENATOR WINNER JUST SAID. THIS IT GIVES US FOR YEARS AS WE ARE LOWER. THE COVERT BACKLOG TO GROW ON TRUTH EXACTLY. A THOSE CAN. AND I THEY BE VIEW. TO BE WITHOUT MERIT BUT THAT. THAT A SUNSET GIVES A SET OPPORTUNITY- I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN IPHONE. THANK YOU BRING USER LAYERED.

THREE THREE FOUR BY SENATOR ALSO THEN S. B. SEVENTY. TWO BY CENTER HERTZBERG THAN S. B. TWO FOUR ONE BY YOURS TRULY ALL RIGHT. THE COVER GIRL THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT S. B. THREE TWO THREE WHICH WOULD CREATE AB ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAY STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR CLAIMS AGAINST WATER AND SEWER AGENCY RATE SETTINGS WATER AND SEWER UTILITY BUDGETS ARE FUNDED BY REVENUE COLLECTED THROUGH SERVICE RATES THESE RATES PROVIDE THE FUNDING NECESSARY TO SUPPLY SAFE DRINKING WATER UPGRADE AND IMPROVE AGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND TO OPERATE EFFECTIVELY. EXISTING LAW ALLOWS LAWSUITS THAT SEEK REFUNDS OR SEEK TO INVALIDATE EXISTING RATE STRUCTURES YEARS AFTER RATES HAVE BEEN ADOPTED AND COLLECTED DELAYED LAWSUITS CAN THREATEN AND AGENCIES ABILITY TO REPAY DEBT GUARANTEED BY REVENUE FROM RATES DERAIL ONGOING INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AND GENERALLY UNDERMINE IN AGENCIES ABILITY TO MAINTAIN STABLE BUDGETS NECESSARY TO OPERATE EFFECTIVELY. THERE'S BEEN AN INCREASING NUMBER OF LEGAL CHALLENGES FILED AGAINST WATER AND SEWER AGENCIES RATE STRUCTURES OUT FOR INSTANCE IN FEBRUARY A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT WAS FILED AGAINST EIGHTY ONE WATER SUPPLIERS IN CALIFORNIA CHEN CHALLENGING THEIR ABILITY TO CHARGE RATEPAYERS FOR THE COST OF PROVIDING CRITICAL LIFESAVING WATER SUPPLIERS SUPPLIES FOR FIRE HYDRANTS. FOR SOME OF THE AGENCY SUED THE CHALLENGE RATES WERE ADOPTED FIVE YEARS PRIOR TO THE LAWSUIT AND NOW WITH THE ADDITIONAL STRAIN OF THE EXACT GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER PROHIBITING WATER SHUT OFFS REGARDLESS OF A CUSTOMER'S ABILITY TO PAY WATER AND SEWER AGENCIES ARE UNDER CONSTANT FINANCIAL STRAIN. AND CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS ARE AT RISK. SB THREE TWENTY THREE AT CONSISTENCY EXISTING LAW BY AUTHORIZING A LOCAL AGENCY OR INTERESTED PERSON TO BRING A VALIDATION ACTION IN SUPERIOR COURT. TO DETERMINE THE VALIDITY OF A FEE OR CHARGE FOR WATER AND SEWER SERVICE. IF A VALIDATION ACTION IS NOT BROUGHT WITHIN A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS PARTIES WOULD BE BARRED FROM CHALLENGING THE VALIDITY OF THE FEET OR THE CHARGE UNTIL THE NEXT TIME THAT IT'S RAISED. THIS BILL IS ADDITIONALLY IN LINE WITH EXISTING PRECEDENT MODELED AFTER THE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TO TWENTY DAY STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ENACTED IN TWO THOUSAND FOR MUNICIPAL ELECTRIC RATES FOR CHARGES. BY ALLOWING CUSTOMERS TO BRING CHALLENGES WITHIN A REASONABLE BUT LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BALANCE THE INTERESTS OF THE REPAIRS WITH THOSE OF THE PUBLIC WATER AND SEWER AGENCY AND THE CURRENT PRIVATE. PRACTICE THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS CHRIS ANDERSON OF AQUA THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES. AND PAUL COOK GENERAL MANAGER OF IRVINE RANCH WATER DISTRICT. ALL RIGHTY IS CHRISSIE ANDERSON AVAILABLE TESTIFIED. YES MISTER CHAIR OUR STANDARDS IN CLOSURES OKAY. GREAT WELL GOOD EVENING MISS RETURN NUMBERS AGAIN CHRIS ANDERSON ON BEHALF MISTER STATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES FOR THEPROUD SPONSOR OF SB THREE TWO THREE. JUST WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE I THINK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE ANALYSIS AND SENATOR CABALLERO FOR EFFORTS ON THE STILL. SB THREE TWO THREE IS NOT A NEW OR REVOLUTIONARY IDEA AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED THIS BILL ALIGNS WITH LONGSTANDING PRECEDENT IN EXISTING LAW THE HUNDRED TWENTY DAY FACTUAL-LIMITATIONS RT IT'S PROVIDED FOR MUNICIPAL ELECTRIC RATES. CAN ACTUALLY BE TO PASS A DRUG TEST BY WATER AND SEWER AGENCIES AND OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENT FEES AND CHARGES. THE LEGISLATURE CREATED THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS BECAUSE IT RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO MINIMIZE FISCAL UNCERTAINTY FOR PUBLIC AGENCIES THAT PROVIDE ESSENTIAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES. IN SB THREE TWO THREE IF HE CAN TO PROVIDE SIMILAR PROTECTIONS FOR WATER AND SEWER SERVICE. PUBLIC WATER AND SEWER AGENCIES ARE LARGELY FUNDED BY RATE REVENUE WITH THESE RATES BY THAT. GROUP EIGHTEEN INFRASTRUCTURE BUILD DELIVERY SYSTEM MAINTAIN RELIABLE OPERATIONS AND MORE. LEGAL CHALLENGES TO RAGE STRUCTURES CAN HAVE A FINANCIALLY STABLE ENOUGH FOR PUBLICATION SEAT. AT THE COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES POINTS OUT TO EIGHTEEN IT'S BEEN FERTILE GROUND FOR A MEDICATION AND- THE RECENT CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST EIGHTY ON WATER SUPPLIERS IN CALIFORNIA STIMULATING GRANDMA. DOWN TO PROP TO EIGHTEEN ARE BEING TESTED. IN THAT CASE YOU NEED TO DEFEND AND AGENCIES I DON'T MENTION THE TOP THEIR- THAT DOCTOR THEIR RATE YEARS BEFORE THE LAWSUIT WAS FILED. SB THREE TWO THREE ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE BY ALLOWING REPAIRS TO BRING LAWSUITS WITHIN A REASONABLE BUT- TIME. BY DOING SO THE BILL STRIKES A BALANCE BETWEEN PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF RATE PAYERS AND NINE REPUBLIC WATER AND SEWER AGENCIES LOCAL EIGHT I NECESSARY FINANCIAL UNCERTAINTY. FOR THESE REASONS WE QUESTOR AIBO AND HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER HARRISON MISTER COOK. ARE YOU ON THE LINE GOO EVENING. THANK YOU EVENING HERE BERGEN THINK YOU FOR THE ON.

OUR PUBLIC PROCESS. MICHAEL WATER AND- OUR AGENCIES ARE TO BE BEGIN RIGHT SO PRESS WHAT THEY CALL OF SIR STUDY THIS DETAILED STUDY EXPLAINS METHODOLOGY FOR HOW RATES ARE SET AND HOW COSTS ARE ALLOCATED AMONG CUSTOMERS. OTHER PARTS TO RETAIN STE BECAUSE OF SERVICE. RIGHT SAID IS TIED DIRECTLY TO ANY. BUDGET AND THAT IS WHERE WE PUT THAT WILL BE PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR THE PROPOSED RATES. ARE WDAS RATE POLICY DECISIONS EXPENSES PROPOSED RATE IMPACTS AT MULTIPLE PUBLIC MEETINGS AT LEAST NINE FOR OUR CURRENT RATE SETTING PROCESS. PRIOR TO THE RATES BEING CONSIDERED FOR PROPERTY OWNER IN CUSTOMER. THEY PROP TO EIGHTEEN NOTICE AT LEAST FORTY FIVE DAYS PRIOR. TO A PUBLIC HEARING ON THE PROPOSED RATES.

THAT ARE TO BE THE REVERSE PER. TO EACH OF THE PROTEST LETTERS OR COMMENTS THAT WE RECEIVED. ONLY A TO THIS VERY PUBLIC AN EXTENSIVE PROCESS OUR RATES CONSIDERED FOR ADOPTION BY REPORT. BECAUSE THIS IS A VERY TRANSPARENT PROCESS WE BELIEVE THAT A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS JUDGE LIMITATIONS NEARLY ONE THIRD OF A YEAR. STRIKES THE APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN. REQUIRING PROMPT RATE CHALLENGES AND STILL ALLOWING A SUFFICIENT TIME FOR RATEPAYERS CHALLENGER RAGE INCLUDING ELECTED THANKS CENTER TO COVER YOUR AUTHORING.

ALREADY WILL TAKE YOU AS PRIMARY OPPOSITION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR IN THE BILL'S SPONSORS FOR ACCEPTING ONE OF OUR AMENDMENTS BUT OTHER CONCERNS REMAIN. THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT IN THE CITY OF ONTARIO BE SUPERIOR COURT SAID THAT SOME APPLICATION TO THE VALIDATION STATUTE WERE OF DOUBTFUL CONSTITUTIONALITY BECAUSE- AN AGENCY MAY INDIRECTLY BUT EFFECTIVELY VALIDATE IT ACTION BY DOING NOTHING TO VALIDATE IT. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE CASES OF DOUBTFUL CONSTITUTIONALITY. THE VALIDATION OF THAT YOU INTENDED TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC WHEN THE GOVERNMENT IS THE DEBTORS SUCH AS WHEN THE GOVERNMENT BORROWS MONEY OR AGREED TO PAY FOR GOODS OR SERVICES. SB THREE TWO THREE- ONCE THE VALIDATION STATUE TO PROTECT THE GOVERNMENT WHEN THE PUBLIC IS THE DATA BETTER. SB THREE TWO THREE TRYING TO VALIDATION THAT YOU'RE GONNA TED. BECAUSE WATER AND SANITATION VITAL TO HEALTH AND THEREFORE SHOULD BE ON OF SHOULD BE SHOULD NOT BE ON AFFORDABLE BECAUSE WATER AND SEWER FEES CAN BE LEANED AND THREATEN HOMEOWNERSHIP. THE RULES FOR VALID WATER AND SEWER CHARGES ARE PART OF THE STATE CONSTITUTION. THE VALIDATION STUDY WAS NEVER MEANT FOR CLOSE CONSTITUTIONAL CASES FROM COURT. TO PREVENT UNFAIRNESS IN AGENCIES AT LEAST BE REQUIRED TO BRING ITS OWN VALIDATION ACTION WITH ON WHICH WITHIN A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS. TO OBTAIN THE PROTECTION OF THE STATUTE THE AGENCIES WILL TELL YOU THIS IS COST PROHIBITIVE BUT IT'S FAR MORE COST PROHIBITIVE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYER TO BRING SUCH AN ACTION AND EVEN MORE SO FOR RATE PAYERS TO PAY A POTENTIALLY ILLEGAL FEE INSULATED FROM CHALLENGED. DESPITE THE ABSENCE OF NOTICE TO THE PUBLIC REVIEW BY A COURT ENTRY OF JUDGMENT OR OTHER DUE PROCESS. FINALLY THE KASUR CASE AGAINST ANYONE WATER DISTRICT IS BEING USED TO JUSTIFY THIS BILL DOES NOT JUSTIFY.

WE HAVE SOME OF THE CONSOLIDATES AMERICAN SALAS. SB THREE THREE EIGHT. THE COURTESY. SHARES I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS MENTION ON PAGE ELEVEN OF THE ANALYSIS- BUT I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT SB THREE THREE EIGHT AND I THINK THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH US AS WELL IT'S AN IMPORTANT MEASURE TO PROTECT THE CENTRAL FRONT LINE TRUCK DRIVERS THAT ARE CALIFORNIA PORTS WERE STILL WORKING HARD EACH DAY DURING THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC IN BEYOND THESE TRUCK DRIVERS HAVE BEEN A TORY ASLI EXPLOITED BY BAD ACTORS IN THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY WHO ROUTINELY CLASS OF MISCLASSIFIED THEM TO CUT COSTS WRONGFULLY EXCLUDE WORKERS FOR MINIMUM WAGE. WORKERS COMPENSATION AND THE RIGHT TO JOIN A UNION DURING THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC MISCLASSIFIED WORKERS HAVE ALSO BEEN EXCLUDED FROM UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SICK DAYS AND BASIC HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTECT PROTECTIONS LIKE PP EVEN THOUGH MISS CLASSIFICATION IS ILLEGAL IT'S OFTEN CHEAPER FOR TRUCKER CME TRUCKING COMPANIES TO SETTLE WAGE CLAIMS FOR PENNIES ON THE DOLLAR THEN TO PROVIDE THEIR WORKERS WITH THE PROTECTIONS AND PAY THEY DESERVE. SB THREE THREE EIGHT ADDRESSES THE ONGOING PROBLEM BY BUILDING OFF THE EXISTING LAW FORTINO TWO TO BE EXACT WHERE AND TRUCKING COMPANIES THAT WALK AWAY FROM UNPAID WAGE CLAIMS GET ADDED TO A JOINT LIABILITY BAD ACTOR LIST SB THREE THREE EIGHT ADS COMPANIES TO THIS BAD ACTOR LISTED THE OF UNABATED SERIOUS CAL OSHA VIOLATIONS THE BILL ALSO SPECIFICALLY TARGETS PRIOR OFFENDERS HAVE MISCLASSIFIED THEIR WORKERS. FINALLY SB THREE THREE EIGHT REQUIRES COMPANIES TO CONDUCT AN AUDIT TO SHOW THAT THEY A FIX THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM IN ORDER TO GET OFF OF THIS BAD ACTOR LIST I WORK CLOSELY WITH THE CALIFORNIA TRUCKING ASSOCIATION TO MAKE THE BILL STRONGER AND WITH THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS TODAY WE WILL STRENGTHEN THE FOCUS OF THE BILL TO TARGET ONLY THE WORST OF THE WORST BAD ACTORS THOSE WHO ROUTINELY DENY THEIR WORKERS OR HAVE UNABATED SERIOUS CAL OSHA VIOLATIONS WEAK WHICH CAN CAUSE SERIOUS HARM OR DEATH. WE CERTAINLY KNOW THAT OUR TRUCK DRIVERS AT OUR PORTS ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS WERE CRITICAL TO MAINTAINING THE SUPPLY CHAIN TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT TODAY HAVE SHANE GUSMAN FROM THE CALIFORNIA TEAMSTERS PUBLIC AFFAIRS COUNCIL AND CAITLIN V. GO. FROM THE IN. BROTHERHOOD OF. PORT DIVISION I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE MR CHART THE PROBATE USER GONZALEZ. SERVICEMEN ARE YOU AVAILABLE. YES THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SHANE GUSMAN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS PUBLIC AFFAIRS COUNCIL IN SUPPORT AND PROUD TO CO SPONSOR THIS BILL. FOR US THE POINT OF THIS BILL IS TO ADDRESS THE LONG HISTORY OF DRIVER MISS CLASSIFICATION. THAT HAS OCCURRED IN THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY EVER SINCE IT WAS DE REGULATED FOR DECADES AGO. NO WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE OF THIS PROBLEM GREATER THAN OUR IN OUR LARGEST PORTS. THEIR EXPLOITATION IS THE DOMINANT ECONOMIC MODEL. TRUCKING COMPANIES HIRE WORK FORCE OF MOSTLY IMMIGRANT DRIVERS WHO ARE FORCED TO ACT AS IF THEY ARE IN BUSINESS FOR THEMSELVES RESPONSIBLE FOR PURCHASING OR LEASING THEIR OWN TRUCKS. PAYING FOR ALL OF THE FUEL AND MAINTENANCE. ALL RIGHT EXCEPT IN AN EXTREMELY LOW NON NEGOTIABLE RATE. IT'S NOT UNCOMMON TO HAVE MONTHS WHERE THE COST OF MAINTAINING THE TRUCK IS ACTUALLY MORE THAN THE DRIVER MAKES. ON TOP OF THIS THESE DRIVERS GET NO HEALTH CARE NO MINIMUM WAGE NO OVERTIME NO WORKERS COMP NO PAID SICK SICK DAYS. AND ABSOLUTELY NO PROTECTIONS DURING THE PANDEMIC. THESE ARE THE FACTS ON THE GROUND. HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS. LABOR COMMISSIONER INVESTIGATIONS AND LAWSUITS HAVE UNIVERSALLY CONCLUDED WITH FINDINGS THAT THE PORT DRAYAGE DRIVERS ARE IN FACT MISCLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES. COUNTLESS NEWS ARTICLES HAVE CHRONICLED THIS PROBLEM FOR MANY YEARS NONETHELESS THE PROBLEM PERSISTS. THE TEAMSTERS COMMUNITY GROUPS AND OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO HELP THESE DRIVERS. FOUR YEARS UNFORTUNATELY THE WAY THEY ARE MISCLASSIFIED AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS HAS MADE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO ACT COLLECTIVELY. FOUR YEARS AGO WE REALIZE THAT THE REAL WAY TO TACKLE THIS PROBLEM IS TO GET AT THE ROOT OF IT. THE GIANT COMPANIES THAT BENEFIT FROM THE SYSTEM NEED TO TAKE SOME RESPONSIBILITY WE SPONSORED SB FORTINO TO LARA. WHICH PROVIDE. FOR JOINT LIABILITY OF THE COMPANY HIRED ONE OF THESE BAD ACTOR TRUCKING FIRMS TO SHIP GOODS. HOWEVER TOO MANY LOOPHOLES HAVE LEFT THE HALL THE BILL INEFFECTIVE. IN ACHIEVING SYSTEM THAT SYSTEMIC CHANGE. WE NEED TO SB THREE THREE EIGHT TO FILL THESE LOOPHOLES AND MAKE SURE THE EXPLICATION ENDS ONCE AND FOR ALL THANK YOU THANK YOU. LAS VEGAS.

OF PRESIDING OVER JUTISH TODAY ALL RIGHT CENTER NUMBER DO YOU ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS AS PROPOSED IN THE ANALYSIS ON PAGES ELEVEN THROUGH TWELVE COMMON NUMBER FOUR. I DO ACCEPT THE MOMENTS ALL RIGHT WITH THAT- WOULD YOU LIKE TO PLEASE PRESENT. ON YOUR BILL TODAY THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIR AND SPECIAL THANK YOU TO COMMITTEE STAFF IN PARTICULAR ROLES MEREDITH FOR THEIR HARD WORK IN HER HARD WORK ON THIS BILL WE'VE ACCEPTED SOME AMENDMENTS. TO RESPOND TO CONCERNS ABOUT THE ACCURACY OF THE RECORD- SO WHAT WE'RE DOING IS THAT WHEN A WITNESS TESTIFIES REMOTELY IF COUNCIL OR THE JUDGE. THEY BELIEVE THAT IF THEY BELIEVE THAT THE RECORD IS NOT GOING TO BE KEPT ACTOR LEAVE THEY BELIEVE THERE'S SOME SORT OF TECHNICAL GLITCH THEY CAN STOP. THE REMOTE PRESENTATION THE REMOTE TESTIMONY AND REQUIRE THE WITNESS TO APPEAR LIVE- THERE ARE TWO ASPECTS OF THIS BILL BUT BOTH DEAL WITH CORE DEFICIENCIES WE HAVE A GREAT DEAL CHALLENGE. CHALLENGE WITH RESPECT TO ACCESS TO JUSTICE IT'S BECOMING MORE AND MORE EXPENSIVE FOR ALL PARTICIPANTS. TO SEEK JUSTICE IN CALIFORNIA THIRTY TWO PORTIONS OF THE BILL. THE FIRST PERSON THE BILL. DEALS WITH OF THE ISSUE CONCERNING COURT REPORTING IN OUT OF STATE COURT REPORTING WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT THE BILL DESIGNATES. IN RESPONSE TO CONCERNS BY COURT REPORTERS DESIGNATES. A COURT REPORTER BASICALLY WHO HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT AT THE STATE COURT REPORTING AND COURT REPORTER SO IT DESIGNATES A- PERSON OR AN ENTITY TO BE A COURT REPORTER- THAT IS RESPONSIBLE. FOR THE OUT OF STATE ACTIVITIES. IT ALSO ALLOWS FOR REMOTE TESTIMONY THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN LIGHT OF THE COVERT CRISIS THERE ARE WITNESSES WHO TESTIFIED. FOR EXAMPLE A CUSTODIAN OF RECORDS IS SIMPLY COMES IN TO TESTIFY AS TO THE AUTHENTICITY OF RECORDS OR HOW THE RECORDS ARE KEPT. THERE'S REALLY NO REASON WHY THAT WITNESS NEED TO TESTIFY IN PERSON AND THUS THE WITNESS IF TWO PARTIES STIPULATE CONTEST BY REMOTELY AND IF ONE PARTY WON'T STIPULATE BUT THERE'S A MOTION THE JUDGE BELIEVES IT'S APPROPRIATE. THEY CAN'T COME IN TO TESTIFY AGAIN IF THEIR TESTIMONY IS INTERFERED WITH EITHER BY BECAUSE BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGY OR SOME OTHER REASON THEY CAN BE REQUIRED TO COME. AND TESTIFY IN PERSON IN LIFE I HAVE- WITH ME ON THE PHONE LINE THE TWO WITNESSES MISTER GREG RESEAL AND ALSO- THE VINO HURT- CHAIR OF THE- FIRM REGISTRATION SUBCOMMITTEE THE COURT REPORTERS BOARD OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU- AS WAS STATED WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO INDIVIDUALS WISHING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT AND WE HAVE A DIVISION OR HEARD FROM COURT REPORTERS BOARD OF CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS A GROUP GREGORY ZERO FROM CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA. MODERATOR CAN YOU CONFIRM THAT- THESE INDIVIDUALS THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE ON. AND THAT THEY WILL HAVE TWO MINUTES EACH. GOOD EVENING THANK. GOOD EVENING SB HURT YOU KNOW EXCELLENT STREAMING MY NAME GIVING HER TIME THE PUBLIC MEMBER OF THE COURT REPORTERS BOARD THANK YOU CHAIR- BURKE AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU ON THE IMPORTANCE OF SB TWO FOR ONE FOR THE CONSUMER AND NOTABLY THE FIRM REGISTRATION PORTION. LEGISLATURE AS CAREFULLY SET OUT PROCEDURES GOVERNING PREPARATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT NOT JUST ONE AREA OF THE CODE BUT NUMEROUS PLACES AND ALONG- BEFORE YOU THE BOY TO BUILD TO SIR. AND PROTECT CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS HAVE BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY GROWING DISREGARD FOR THE EXISTING LAWS BY NONWHITE BE OWNED FIRMS. AND THE BOARD EMPHASIZES CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS BECAUSE MANY OF THESE FIRMS WILL NO PROBLEM SUBMITTING TO FIRM REGISTRATION AND FILING LOW LONG. AND THEIR OWN HOME STATE. AS WELL AS OTHER STATES IN WHICH THEY DO BUSINESS TEXAS GEORGIA ARIZONA AND NEVADA. CRB IS PROPERLY POISED TO HOLD NON LICENSEE OWNED FIRMS ACCOUNTABLE TO REFUSE TO FOLLOW SIMILAR LAWS IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE SUPPORT SB TWO FOUR ONE. THE TYPE OF COMPLAINTS RECEIVED BY THE BOARD INCLUDE BILLING IRREGULARITIES AND TRANSCRIPT MISCONDUCT ALLOWING ONE SIDE YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THE TRANSCRIPTS BEFORE THE OTHER THERE BY GIVING THEM AN ADVANTAGE. IN PREPARING FOR LITIGATION. DEPOSITION ALSO MUST BE IN AND EACH PARTY MUST BE TO EQUALLY AND- THE BOARD OF WORK WELL WITH ATTORNEY OFFICE THE ACTUAL ENFORCEMENT ARM OF THE BOARD FOR THE SIMPLE SOLUTION TO HOLD ALL PROVIDERS OF COURT REPORTING SERVICES. TO THE STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY THE PLUCKY NO WHERE THEY ARE STATED LOCATE. OR WHO OWNS THE BUSINESS. SINCE THE EIGHTIES THE MORNING WELCOME TO BUSINESS MY BECAUSE CARPET AND FREE. IS GOOD FOR THE CONSUMER IT'S BIRTH HEALTHY REYES THE QUALITY OF. LOWERS PRICE AN EXTRA OUR TO GOODS AND SERVICES. WHAT IS GOOD FOR THE CONSUMER IT'S THE BALL ON A TO STAY IN AND THE LAWS AROUND OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT THAT WERE GIVEN. TO IT BY THE LEGISLATURE. WE THANK PREDATOR AMBER AFTER THE DEDICATION SIX PER. AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF SB TWO FOUR ONE FOR EQUAL PROTECTION OF ALL CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS THANK YOU THANK YOU MISS HURT AND NOW WE'LL MOVE ON TO MISTER GREGG REZERO- WITH THE- ADDED- COMMENT THAT IF WE COULD PLEASE KEEP IT UNDER TWO MINUTES THAT BE WONDERFUL. I WILL DO MY BEST GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS GREGORY G. ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA TESTIFYING AS A CO SPONSOR OF SB TWO FORTY ONE. PM SPEAKING ON THE REMOTE LIVE WITH THIS PORTION OF THE BILL. SB TWO FORTY ONE HAS SUPPORT BY BOTH DEFENSE AND PLAINTIFF COUNSEL AS IT HELPS CREATE BOTH SAFETY AND EFFICIENCY IN THE COURTS. LIKE MANY OTHER PROFESSIONS THIS PANDEMIC IS CREATED SERIOUS ISSUES FOR THE COURTS AS WE NOW FACE A YEAR'S WORTH OF BACKLOGGED CASES DUE TO THE CLOSURES. NOW THE TIME TO FOCUS ON MAKING THE COURTS MORE EFFICIENT HELP MAKE UP FOR THOSE BACKLOGS. WHILE ATTORNEYS MANY TIMES HAVE TO CALL NON CRITICAL WITNESSES TO PROVIDE BASIC FOUNDATIONAL EVIDENCE AS AN EXAMPLE WHEN TRYING AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT CASE. WHERE MY CLIENT OBTAIN EMERGENCY MEDICAL TREATMENT. I MIGHT HAVE TO CALL A HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATOR TO PROVIDE ABOUT THREE TO FIVE MINUTES WITH THE TESTIMONY. TO SIMPLY SAY THAT THE BILL IN FRONT OF THE JURY IS BOTH ACCURATE AND REAL. FORTUNATELY FOR THAT ADMINISTRATORS STAFF TO TAKE THE DAY OFF FROM WORK MANY TIMES ON PAGE. DRIVE MANY MILES WHATEVER COURTHOUSE EDUCATION BEING TRIED AND- FINING PAPER PARKING BEFORE SITTING IN A COURT HALLWAY. WAITING UP TO THREE TO FOUR. TWO TO THREE HOURS TO PROVIDE THAT SAME THREE TO FIVE MINUTES WITH THE TESTIMONY. THIS IS ONE EXAMPLE OF MANY OF NON CRITICAL WITNESSES THAT DO NOT NEED TO COME TO COURT. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THERE'S BEEN SOME CONCERN THAT WITNESSES MIGHT NOT BE HEARD MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO PRESERVE THE COURT RECORD FOR APPEAL. TO TRIAL LAWYER FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS I DO NOT SHARE THIS CONCERN ALL TRIAL LAWYERS KNOW THAT WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO PROTECT OUR CLIENTS ABOUT RIGHT. JUDGES ALSO HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO PROTECT THE SAME. RIGHT ADDITIONALLY ATTORNEYS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY MAKING CORPS TO KEEP PARENTS IS BY PHONE IN DEPARTMENTS FOR OVER FIFTEEN YEARS. WHEN THE JUDGES NOT HERE'S HERE'S THE HE OR SHE- SIMPLY SAYS PLEASE SAY IT AGAIN.

SHE COULD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS LED THE SANTOS ON BEHALF OF THE SEIU CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING OFFICIAL COURT REPORTERS WORKING IN COURT. THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND REGRETFUL OPPOSITION TO ATHLETES CHIU FORTY ONE. CONTRARY TO WHAT PROPONENTS HAVE ARTICULATED THERE IS NO LIMITATION IN THIS MATTER THAT IS APPLIED ONLY TEN NONESSENTIAL WITNESSES MEANING IT APPLIES TO EVERY SINGLE TYPE OF WITNESSES INCLUDING AN EVIDENTIARY. TESTIMONIAL PROCEEDINGS. I DAY I HEARD FROM A CORE REPORT ABOUT THEY'VE HAD BEING ABLE TO PRODUCE THE OFFICIAL VERBATIM RECORD DURING THE PANDEMIC HE'S PROBLEMS HAVE RANGED FROM DROPPED LINE FOR BOULDER COUNTY AUDIO PEOPLE TALKING OVER ONE ANOTHER MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO DISCERN WHO THE SPEAKER IS. OVER DOLLARS FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS USES OF NEW PATENTS OPPOSING NON ENGLISH SPEAKING PARTIES BEING ON ONE LINE WITH ONE TRANSLATOR WITH THE COURT REPORTER UNABLE TO HEAR ANY PART OF IT. UNLIKE THE REST OF US FOR WHOM THESE TECHNOLOGICAL DIFFICULTIES ARE MERE INCONVENIENCE IN THIS LITTLE. IS OFFICIAL COURT REPORTERS ARE TASKED WITH PRODUCING THE OFFICIAL VERBATIM RECORDS THERE IS NO EXEMPTION UNDER EXISTING LAW PERMITTING THEM TO REPLACE TESTIMONY WITH NOTATIONS OF AN ARTICLE OR UNINTELLIGIBLE WHEN THEY CAN'T HEAR YOUR LICENSES ARE ON THE LINE FOR GUARD BUT- AND THIS IS. SOME HYPOTHETICAL SCENARIO THERE ARE CURRENTLY MULTIPLE FINALLY BEFORE THE C. R. BOARD ALLEGING FACT SECTION THE TESTIMONY WERE NOT ACCURATELY TRANSCRIBE DURING REMOTE PROCEEDINGS ARE APPEARANCES IT MIGHT BE ESTARá CAN'T HEAR WHAT IS BEING SAID OR BY WHOM THEY CAN'T TRANSCRIBE. THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR THEM AND THEIR ABILITY TO DO THEIR JOB AND MAINTAIN THEIR LICENSES IT'S A PROBLEM FOR EVERY PARTY NEEDS TO RELY ON THE OFFICIAL VERBATIM RECORD FOR PURPOSES OF PURSUING THE RIGHT TO APPEAL. THIS IS PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC GIVEN THE NATURE OF HEALTH PARTIES AND COURTS WOULD DECIDE UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL WHETHER A WITNESS MAY IF YOU'RE REMOTELY THERE'S NO OBLIGATION IN THE BILL REQUIRING THAT A PARTY MAY BE FULLY MUST BE FULLY INFORMED ABOUT THE RIGHT HERE SHE MAY POTENTIALLY BE WAITING. BY AGREEING TO A SCENARIO WHICH COULD PROVE TO SELL FAULTY IS A RIGHT THE PONTIFF HE'LL BECOME A CENTERS. IF YOU COULD PLEASE WRAP FINALLY. I JUST WANT TO MAKE FINAL THAT. THAT AMEND THAT WORKS TO. REQUIRED RECORDING OR ARE NOT GOING DO ANY BECAUSE FOR CORPS STILL TO BE PLAN AND IF WE HEAR WITH THE RECORD RECORDING. IT'S MAKE THE TRIP.

THREE POINT OUT. ONE OTHER THING ABOUT THE BILL THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT THE PANDEMIC OF THE CONTRAST THE PROBLEMS DURING THE PANDEMIC THIS BILL IS REALLY IN AT. JUNE STATUTES THAT WILL APPLY TO BE UTILIZED BECAUSE PANDEMIC WE ARE QUITE. DISAPPOINTS THAT THIS BILL IS MOVING TOWARD WITH VERY LITTLE INPUT FROM STAKEHOLDERS SUCH AS THE COURT REPORTERS SO THAT WE CAN SHARE ALL OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE SEE ON A DAILY BASIS. AND WE BELIEVE IT IS MORE BENEFICIAL TO GET A WORKING GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS TO DISCUSS REMOTE APPEARANCES- AND HOW IT'S WORKING HOW IT'S NOT WORKING DURING THE PANDEMIC AND THEY COME UP WITH A GAME PLAN OF WHAT TO DO. POSTGANGLIONIC WE ALL KNOW MORTGAGE ZERO THREE IS IN EFFECT RIGHT NOW AND WILL REMAIN IN THE FACT FOR UP TO NINETY DAYS PAST- THE LIFTING OF THE CAP OF THE PUBLIC OUT OF ORDER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO THERE IS NO RUSH. TO PASS THE STATE ALSO BE ASKING WE CONSIDER THAT ON THE POINT REGARDING. OUT OF STATE. FORMER DISTRESS. PETER AND HIS PUSH FOR SOMETHING SIMILAR FOR MANY YEARS WITH A LOT OF. OPPOSITION FROM OF MR.

TODAY THANK YOU SIR DRAWS ON ANY OTHER. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WISHING TO SPEAK I SEE NO MIKE'S UP. ALL RIGHT DOESN'T REMEMBER IT WAS LIKE TO CLOSE- THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR BUT LET ME FIRST COMMENT ALL WITH RESPECT TO COURT REPORTERS- AS A PRACTICING LAWYER. WHO'S BEEN IN PRACTICE FOR SOME TIME. COURT REPORTERS ARE INCREDIBLY DILIGENT AND THEY ARE INCREDIBLY PROTECTIVE OF THEIR RECORD AND THEY DO AN EXCELLENT JOB I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES A COURT REPORTER HAS TOLD ME THAT. EITHER THE ANSWER WAS MUFFLED- MY QUESTION WAS MUFFLED OR SOME SUCH THING AND DONE AN ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING JOB MAKING SURE THERE'S AN ACCURATE RECORD AND THEY HAVE AN INTEREST IN ACCURATE RECORD. WHAT THE LAWYERS HAVE BEEN OF A GREATER INTEREST IN THE JUDGE HAS AN INTEREST IN THE RECORD IN OUR SYSTEM IS SUCH THAT WE'VE GOT. TO COUNCIL AT LEAST PLUS THE JUDGE WHO'S ALSO INTERESTED IN MAKING SURE THAT THE RECORD IS ACCURATE SO WITH RESPECT TO REMOTE TESTIMONY WE'VE TAKEN THE AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS. I THINK THERE'LL ALWAYS BE A PLACE FOR COURT REPORTER IN THE COURTROOM TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE TESTIMONY. IS ACCURATELY PRESERVE OUR IN TERMS OF WITNESSES THE BILL DOES NOT. RE CLUE TWO PARTIES FROM STIPULATING TO WITNESS IT DOES REQUIRE BOTH PARTIES TO STIPULATE SO BOTH PARTIES ON EACH SIDE STIPULATE TO A WITNESS TESTIFYING REMOTELY THEN THEY THOSE LAWYERS ARE RESPONSIBLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS. A FAIR HEARING IN A FAIR OPPORTUNITY FOR THE TRIER OF FACT TO VIEW THEIR CREDIBILITY. IF ONE PARTY DOES NOT CONSENT THEN THERE'S A MOTION BROUGHT TO THE JUDGE AND THE JUDGE CAN MAKE THAT DECISION BASED ON SEVERAL CRITERIA- SO HAVING SAID ALL THAT I. APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM THE VARIOUS CHORAL AND EDITORS AND I VOTE ALL RIGHT THANK YOU CENTER TO HAVE A MOTION ON SPEECH. FOUR ONE. WELL THAT'S SIX. THAT'S RIGHT HALF AN HOUR AGO SO JOE DID.
