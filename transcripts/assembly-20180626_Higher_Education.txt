WILL CALL THE COMMITTEE TO OF HIGHER ED. TO ORDER AND WITHOUT A PRESENT -- QUORUM PRESIDENT WE WILL BEGIN. AS A SUBCOMMITTEE. AND WE WILL BEGIN WITH ITEM NUMBER ONE SENATOR LEYVA THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU MEMBER. GOOD AFTERNOON I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS IMPORTANT BILL MUCH APPRECIATED. S. B. THREE TWENTY WOULD REQUIRE ALL ON CAMPUS STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS THAT PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES TO PROVIDE MEDICATION FOR EARLY PREGNANCY TERMINATION FOR THEIR STUDENTS BY JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY TWO ACCORDING TO THE GUTTMACHER INSTITUTE SINCE TWO THOUSAND OVER ONE POINT FIVE MILLION WOMEN IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE TERMINATED EARLY PREGNANCIES. THROUGH THE USE OF MEDICATION ABORTION. IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WOMEN AGE TWENTY TO TWENTY FOUR ACCOUNTED 434% OF ABORTIONS THE LARGEST FOR ANY AGE GROUP. STEP PROCESS WHERE PATIENT TAKES TWO SETS OF PILLS OVER THE COURSE OF TWO DAYS DURING THE FIRST TEN WEEKS OF PREGNANCY. ACCORDING TO UC SAN FRANCISCO STUDY ABORTION MEDICATION HAS SERIOUS ADVERSE AFFECTS ONLY AND POINT. ZERO ZERO POINT 5% OF CASES WHICH IS LESS THAN TYLENOL AND*. THAT SAME STUDY ALSO FOUND THAT EVERY MONTH OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE STUDENTS AT THE THIRTY FOUR UC AND CSU CAMPUSES SEEK MEDICATION ABORTIONS AT OFF SITE HEALTHCARE FACILITIES. MANY CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES ALREADY OFFER REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES SUCH AS PREGNANCY OPTIONS. COUNSELING AND CONTRACEPTIVES AND ALL CONSIDER THESE SERVICES TO BE A COMPONENT A BASIC HEALTHCARE SERVICES. MEDICATION ABORTION IS A SAFE PROCEDURE AND IS CLINICALLY SIMPLER THAN MUCH OF THE ALREADY OFFERED CARE ACT COLLEGE STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS SUCH AS DIABETES MANAGEMENT. MENTAL HEALTH CARE AND DIAGNOSED ME DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES CURRENTLY 51% OF STUDENTS ACROSS THE U. CNC ISSUE SYSTEMS ARE LOW INCOME AND TWO THIRDS OF YOU SEE STUDENTS AND ONE THIRD. OF CSU STUDENTS DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION. IF A STUDENT HOUSE TO GO TO AN OFF CAMPUS PROVIDER THAT DOES NOT ACCEPT THERE'S THEIR STUDENT OR OTHER PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE. PAYING FOR MEDICATION ABORTION MAY BE A SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL BURDEN. IN TOTAL TWENTY TWO UC AND CSU CAMPUSES ARE MORE THAN THIRTY MINUTES AWAY FROM THE CLOSEST ABORTIONPROVIDER. VIA PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION THESE BARRIERS ARE WORSENED SINCE ONLY ABORTION PROVIDERS ARE OPEN ON WEEKENDS MEAN THAT STUDENTS HAVE TO ALTER OR MISS CLASSES EXAMS OR WORK. TO ACCESS THIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT BEING ABLE TO ACCESS MEDICATION ABORTION ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES. CRITICAL SINCE WOMEN MUST RECEIVE THIS CARE WITHIN THE FIRST TEN WEEKS OF PREGNANCY. AT MOST WOMEN DON'T EVEN FIND OUT THEY'RE PREGNANT UNTIL THE FIVE TO SIX WEEKS ALONG. DENYING COMPREHENSIVE AND ACCESSIBLE REPRODUCTIVE CARE ON CAMPUS INTERFERES WITH THE WELL BEING AND ACADEMIC SUCCESS UP WOMEN AND DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS STUDENTS OF COLOR AND LOW INCOME STUDENTS. WITH ME TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT IS ALICE CARTWRIGHT A PROJECT DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF OBGYN A REAP REPRODUCTIVE SCIENCES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO. AND JESSICA A STUDENT AT UC RIVERSIDE. SENATOR LEYVA BEFORE THEY PROCEED YEAH I'VE -- OMITTED JUST READ IN A STATEMENT DATA. THERE ARE GUIDELINES FOR THIS COMMITTEE -- FOR BILLS TO BE HEARD THAT IS ALWAYS TESTIMONY FROM TWO WITNESSES FOR SUPPORT. AND TWO WITNESSES FOR OPPOSITION TWO MINUTES EACH. THANK YOU SIR. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK BEFORE THE COMMITTEE TODAY. MY NAME IS ALICE CARD RIGHT AND I'M A PROJECT DIRECTOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO WHERE PART OF A RESEARCH PROGRAM CALLED ADVANCING NEW STANDARDS IN PRODUCT OF HEALTH OR ANSWER. AT UCSF WE RECENTLY CONDUCTED TO RESEARCH STUDIES RELATED TO CAMPUS ACCESS TO MEDICATION ABORTION CALIFORNIA WHICH ARE BOTH RECENTLY BEEN PUBLISHED IN PEER REVIEW JOURNALS. THE FIRST STUDY BUT BY MY COLLEAGUE DR DANIEL GROSSMAN COLLECTED INFORMATION FROM ALL OF THE UC AND CSU STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS TO UNDERSTAND IF THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO PROVIDE MEDICATION ABORTION ON CAMPUS. YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN A COPY OF THE REPORT SO YOU KNOW THE CONCLUSION FROM THIS RESEARCH THAT IT WOULD BE VERY FEASIBLE TO OFFER MEDICATION ABORTION AT THE UC AND CSU STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS. THE METHOD MAY BE SAFELY PROVIDED BY OBGYN ENDS FAMILY MEDICINE OR INTERNAL MEDICINE PHYSICIANS ADVANCED PRACTICE CLINICIANS SUCH AS NURSE PRACTITIONERS CERTIFIED NURSE MIDWIVES OR PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS. OR ANY PHYSICIAN A CLINICIAN WHO'S BEEN TRAINED TO PROVIDE IT. THE NATIONAL ACADEMIES OF SCIENCE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE ISSUED A REPORT EARLIER THIS YEAR ON THE SAFETY OF ABORTION GENERALLY AND MEDICATION ABORTION IN PARTICULAR. THE REPORT ALSO HIGHLIGHTED THAT ADVANCED PRACTICE CLINICIANS MAY PROVIDE THE SERVICE AND IT CAN BE PROVIDED IN A VARIETY OF HEALTH CARE SETTINGS. FOR THE SECOND STUDY WHICH IS CONDUCTED BY OUR TEAM AT UCSF LED BY DR I SMOKE POT THE AYE. WE SOUGHT TO UNDERSTAND THE DEMAND FOR MEDICATION ABORTION FROM AMONG STUDENTS THAT YOU SEE IS AND CS USE AND THE CURRENT BARRIERS THEY FACE ACCESSING CARE. WE IS A MULTI STEP METHODOLOGY TO GENERATOR FINDINGS AND I'M HAPPY JUST TO DISCUSS THAT METHODOLOGY IN MORE DETAIL IF THERE'S ANY QUESTION. IN THIS STUDY WE FOUND BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO AND FIVE HUNDRED IN NINETEEN UC AND CSU STUDENTS SEEK MEDICAION ABORTION OFF CAMPUS EACH MONTH. THIS AMOUNTS 220-092-30030 SEVEN CSU STUDENTS AND A HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO YOU SEE STUDENTS PER MONTH. THE MEDIAN TIME AT STUDENTS HAVE TO TRAVEL TO THE NEAREST HEALTH FACILITY THAT PROVIDES ABORTION BY PUBLIC TRANSIT WAS THIRTY FOUR MINUTES EACH WAY. AND TWENTY TWO CAMPUSES FOR MORE THAN THIRTY MINUTES AWAY FROM THE NEAREST PROVIDER BY PUBLIC TRANSIT. GIVEN THE TWO VISITS ARE GENERALLY RECOMMENDED FOR MEDICATION ABORTION CARE MANY STUDENTS WHO HAVE TO TRAVEL OVER TWO HOURS. WE ALSO FOUND THAT THE AVERAGE WAIT TIME UNTIL THE FIRST AVAILABLE APPOINTMENT THE FACILITIES CLOSE TO CAMPUS WAS SEVEN DAYS. MANY UC AND CSU STUDENTS HAVE LIMITED FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO SUPPORT GOING OFF CAMPUS FOR CARE. OVER HALF FOR LOW INCOME 42% OF YOU SEE STUDENTS AND 21% OF CSU STUDENTS EXPERIENCED FOOD INSECURITY AND ABOUT 10% OF CSU SUCH STUDENTS SUFFER HOUSING IN SECURITY INCLUDING HOMELESSNESS. IN ADDITION MANY STUDENTS TWO THIRDS OF YOU SEE STUDENTS AND ONE THIRD OF CSU STUDENTS DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO A CAR. THE TIME COMMITMENTS REQUIRED FOR TRAVEL TO AN EXTERNAL FACILITY ARE COMPOUNDED BY THE APPOINTMENT AVAILABILITY AN INHERENT DELAYS IN SCHEDULING AN APPOINTMENT OFF CAMPUS. SINCE ONLY 15% OF THE CLOSEST FACILITIES ARE OPEN ON WEEKENDS STUDENTS MAY BE FORCED TO MISS CLASSES WORK OR OTHER SCHOOL COMMITMENTS DURING THE WEEK WHICH MAY DETRIMENTALLY IMPACT THEIR SCHOOL SUCCESS. ON TOP OF THE FINANCIAL AND TIME COSTS STUDENTS HAVE TO NAVIGATE AN EXTERNAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM SEPARATE FROM THE STUDENT HEALTH CENTER THEIR HEALTH CARE HOME. WHERE THEY WOULD LIKELY SEEK OTHER PRIMARY HEALTH CARE? AND AS WAS MENTIONED DELAYS IN OBTAINING CARE COULD PUSH STUDENTS PAST TEN WEEKS OF PREGNANCY THE CURRENT LIMIT FOR MEDICATION ABORTION. ACCESS TO ABORTION CARE FOR THOSE WHO WANT IT CAN BE IMPORTANT FOR COLLEGE PARTICIPATION AND SUCCESS AND UNIVERSITIES CAN FULFILL THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO STUDENTS BY PROVIDING DESIRED HEALTH CARE AND SUPPORT FOR THE REPRODUCTIVE LIFE DECISIONS. STUDENTS SEEKING ABORTION NEED CONVENIENT ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. SERVICES THAT DO NOT INVOLVE UNNECESSARY INTERRUPTION AND SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO THEIR COMPLEX LIVES. THE NECESSITY OF LEAVING CAMPUS FOR THE SERVICE WHEN OTHER HEALTH CARE SERVICES CAN BE OBTAINED ON CAMPUS. UNNECESSARILY BURDENS THOSE STUDENTS WHO NEED AN ABORTION THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE OF MY NAME IS JUST ZERO SALAS AND I AM A RECENT GRADUATE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE.% ASIDE FROM BEING A STUDENT I WAS ALSO UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEES AND THE PRESIDENT OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD GENERATION ACTION FOR TWO YEARS. TODAY I CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE FOR REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE AND THIS IS MY ABORTION STORY. I WAS JUST BEGINNING MY THIRD YEAR AT UC RIVERSIDE WHEN I HAD MY ABORTION. IS AROUND OCTOBER WHEN I STARTED TO FEEL SICK SO I DECIDED TO GO TO THE STUDENT HEALTH CENTER. I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST THE STOMACH FLU BUT THE DOCTOR TOLD ME THAT I WAS PREGNANT. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. BUT I DID KNOW THAT I STILL HAD TWO YEARS LEFT OF SCHOOL AND I WAS NOT FINANCIALLY STABLE. I NEEDED AN ABORTION. THE DOCTOR THEN SET UP AN APPOINTMENT WITH A DIFFERENT DOCTOR FROM YOU SEE OUR AND THEN FROM THERE THEY REFERRED ME TO THREE DIFFERENT FACILITIES THE FIRST FACILITY. DID NOT EVEN OFFER ABORTIONS THE SECOND FACILITY WAS ABLE TO SCHEDULE ME AN APPOINTMENT BUT NOT UNTIL MID NOVEMBER. IF THAT WEREN'T ENOUGH TWO WEEKS BEFORE MY APPOINTMENT THE SECOND FACILITY DENIED MY INSURANCE CLAIMING THAT I DID NOT HAVE THE UC STUDENT HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN. I FELT EXTREMELY DISCOURAGED THIS ENTIRE ORDEAL SENT ME ON A DOWNWARD SPIRAL. THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I WAS TAKING MY UPPER DIVISION COURSES. BUT I STOPPED CARRYING. MY GRAY SLIP DRAMATICALLY AND I WAS PLACED ON ACADEMIC PROBATION. I WAS A FIRST GENERATION STUDENT. AND I THOUGHT I HAD RUINED EVERY OPPORTUNITY THAT I EVER HAD. NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO. A COLLEGE STUDENT HEALTH CENTER AGAIN. I'M ASKED ABOUT MY OTHER OPTIONS. IT WAS THEN THAT THEY CLARIFIED THAT IT WAS NOT LIMITED TO THE REFERENCES THAT I WAS GIVEN. SO FINALLY I SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT WITH PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND GOT MY PROCEDURE DONE IN DECEMBER. MY STORY IS NOT UNIQUE. THANK YOU. IN MY SITUATION COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED AT THE STUDENT HEALTH CENTER HAD PROVIDED MEDICATION ABORTION FOR THE STUDENTS ON CAMPUS. S. B. THREE TWENTY WOULD ENSURE THAT PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF.

AFTER SUPPORT TO WITNESSES AND OPPOSITION. TWO MINUTES EACH. MY NAME IS MARY LEE SHRIDER I'M EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF RIGHT TO LIFE OF KERN COUNTY AND WE APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF S. B. THREE TWENTY THOSE WHO PROMOTE THE BILL SAY IT'S ALL ABOUT ACCESS THAT HOURS OF TRAVEL TO THE NEAREST ABORTION CLINIC THE COST OF ABORTION PILLS AND OTHER IMPEDIMENTS. TO OFTEN STAND IN THE WAY OF OUR DAUGHTERS EDUCATIONS THE TRUTH HOWEVER IS THAT THERE IS NO DEMONSTRABLE LACK OF ACCESS ESPECIALLY IN CALIFORNIA. WERE ACCORDING TO THE LATEST NUMBERS FROM THE GUTTMACHER INSTITUTE THERE ARE FIVE HUNDRED AND TWELVE ABORTION PROVIDING FACILITIES AND NONE OF THE ABORTION STRICT RESTRICTIONS THAT ARE OFTEN FOUND IN OTHER STATES. CITED IN THIS MEASURE IS THE DRIVING ME BEHIND IT IS THAT IN ORDER TO REACH ABORTION CLINICS STUDENT SPACE PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE TRAVEL TO CLINICS. THAT MAYBE HOURS FROM THEIR CAMPUS CITY COUNTY OR EVEN GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS THIS IS A GREAT EXAGGERATION IS GEOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS SHOWS. THAT ALL UC AND CSU CAMPUSES ARE LOCATED AN AVERAGE OF ONLY SIX MILES FROM THE NEAREST ABORTION PILL PROVIDER. AS TO THE COST OF THE ABORTION PILLS YES THEY ARE EXPENSIVE BUT THEY'RE ALSO COVERED. STUDENTS WHO DON'T HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE ARE UNEMPLOYED OR SIMPLY DON'T WANT THE ABORTION TO SHOW UP ON THEIR PARENTS INSURANCE. CAN QUICKLY QUALIFY FOR MEDI CAL PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY A STATE PROGRAM THAT ENSURES THE STUDENT BEARS LITTLE TO NO COST FOR HER ABORTION. IT'S BEEN SAID THAT ARE YOU FORTY SIX IS SAFER THAN TYLENOL AND BY AGRA THOUGH NEITHER OF THESE HAS BEEN KNOWN TO PRODUCE HEAVY BLEEDING NAUSEA AND STRONG THE DOMINO PAIN. IN WOMEN AS THEY EXPELLED THEIR PRE BORN BABIES. SINCE APPROVING THE ABORTION DRUG MIFEPRISTONE IN TWO THOUSAND THE U. S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION AND A TWENTY SEVENTEEN SUMMARY REPORTED FOUR THOUSAND CASES OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF THE DRUG. INCLUDING ONE THOUSAND WOMEN WHO REQUIRED HOSPITALIZATIONS FOR SEVERE BLOOD LOSS INFECTIONS AND TWENTY TWO WOMEN WHO DIED AFTER TAKING THE DRUG. ALSO A CONCERN IS THE FACT THAT THE BILL CONTAINS NO CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTOR EXEMPTION FOR EMPLOYEES WHO ARE MORALLY OPPOSED DISTRIBUTING ABORTION PILLS. AT THE JUNE TWELFTH ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE HEARING ON THE BILL WHEN SENATOR LABOR WAS ASKED ABOUT THE LACK OF SUCH AN EXEMPTION SHE DISMISSED THE CONCERN WITH. AND I QUOTE FOLKS DON'T HAVE TO WORK THERE IF THEY DON'T WANT TO AS IF OUR UNIVERSITIES WERE PRIVATELY OWNED BUSINESSES AND NOT PUBLIC STATE ENTITIES THEY'RE OBLIGED TO AT LEAST CONSIDER. THE RIGHTS OF ALL OF OUR CITIZENS. CLEARLY THERE IS NO COMPELLING REASON TO DUPLICATE READILY AVAILABLE MEDICAL SERVICES AND BRING ABORTIONS ONTO OUR COLLEGE CAMPUSES WE URGE YOU TO PLEASE VOTE NO ON THIS EGREGIOUS AND UNNECESSARY BILL [inaudible] THANK YOU. AFTERNOON MY NAME IS KAMALA RODRIGUEZ AND I WORK WITH STUDENTS FOR LIFE OF AMERICA I'M HERE TODAY REPRESENTING NINETY SEVEN GROUP STUDENT GROUPS FROM ACROSS CALIFORNIA ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. SINCE JANUARY FOUR THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE PETITION SIGNATURES HAVE BEEN COLLECTED THROUGH THE STUDENTS ON THEIR CAMPUS. I AND THEY'VE BEEN AND IN THE COMMUNITY -- WHILE ON CAMPUS AND IN THE COMMUNITY WE FOUND THAT DESPITE PERSONAL IDEOLOGIES AND STUDENTS AND ADMINISTRATORS ALIKE THE THE VERY LARGE ISSUES THAT WOULD ARISE AT THE PASSING OF S. B.. THREE TWENTY STUDENTS FROM FRESNO STATE CSU LONG BEACH AND CSU FULLERTON SAT DOWN WITH THEIR CORRESPONDING PRESIDENT TO DISCUSS CONCERNS ON THE BILL. AND WHILE EACH MEETING WITH DIFFERENT FORM EVERY. FOR LEGISLATION THEY HAVE EXTREME CONCERNS WITH THE AND THAT NOT ONE PRESIDENT FROM THE CSU SYSTEM ACTUALLY WANT THIS BILL TO PASS. WHEN ASKED WHY THE PRESIDENT'S WEREN'T SPEAKING UP IF THEY WERE SO OPPOSED TO THE BILL ONE PRESIDENT RESPONDED SAYING THE ULTIMATELY HAD NO SAY IN THE MATTER? THIS GOES FAR BEYOND THE MISSION OF HEALTH CENTERS AND THE LIABILITY SHALL BE PLACED UPON THE CAMPUS HEALTH CENTERS IS MONUMENTAL. THE PRESCRIBER AGREEMENT FORM OF MYTH NEVER PRACTICE DATES THAT THE PURPOSE SCRIBE THE PROVIDER MUST MEET CERTAIN QUALIFICATIONS INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE SURGICAL INTERVENTION IN CASES OF INCOMPLETE ABORTION. AND THAT THE FDA REPORTED THAT INTERVENTION -- OVER FIVE HUNDRED WOMEN SEEKING THIS A MONTH WAS MENTIONED AND THAT'S FIFTEEN STUDENTS A MONTH WILL NEED EMERGENCY CARE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY STUDENTS PER YEAR. WHEN ASKED IF ITS POSITION ON THE BILL THE LEAD PHYSICIAN AT CAL POLY POMONA STATED WE WOULD BE INITIATING A TREATMENT THAT WE IN ALL LIKELIHOOD WILL NOT BE ABLE TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH? STUDENTS WOULD NOT HAVE TO GO TO THE STUDENTS WOULD HAVE TO GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND MIGHT NOT GET THE CARE THEY WANT IN THE EMERGENCY AND IT MIGHT COST THEM TEN TIMES MORE THAN WHAT THEY HAVE PLANS TO BEGIN WITH. CAMPUS IS DO NOT HAVE THE EMERGENCY FACILITIES AVAILABLE IF A STUDENT HAS AN ADVERSE REACTION TO TAKING THE SUPPRESSED ALL IN A TWENTY FOUR HOUR HOTLINE IS NOT GOING TO ALLEVIATE THAT. MY COLLEAGUE REPORTED IT V. -- SIDE EFFECTS OF THIS BILL ONE THAT STUDENT HOLLY PERSON BECAUSE OF THE HOT AND REPORTING THESE SYMPTOMS AND SHE WAS TOLD THEY WERE NORMAL AND TO SEEK EMERGENCY CARE IF THEY GOT WORSE. SHE DIED IN A HOSPITAL SHORTLY AFTER. IT'S YOUR JOB TO PROTECT THE STUDENTS. COST TO IMPLEMENT AND SUSTAIN THIS BILL ARE ASTRONOMICAL AND WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS TO CREATE A PRIVATE FIND IT IS UNCLEAR WHERE THE FUNDING WILL COME FROM AFTER THE INITIAL FUNDS ARE USED. SO HOW ARE UNIVERSITY IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THESE FACILITIES AND THE TRAINING FOR THE PROVIDER IS IN FIVE TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO PROHIBITION OF STUDENT FEES ARE TAX DOLLARS. BLUE USE ONCE THE INITIAL FINEST BANKS AND IT STUDENTS HAVE EXPRESSED THAT THE HIT TUITION COSTS ARE HIGH ENOUGH SO FILM.

WE HEAR THE ANSWER. MEDINA PRESENT BAKER. ARAMBULA BLOOM CHáVEZ IRWIN [inaudible] KILEY LEVINE [inaudible] LOW [inaudible] PATTERSON [inaudible] QUIRK SILVA [inaudible] SANTIAGO WEBER. QUORUM IS PRESENT. HE'D LIKE TO RESTORE YEAH I THINK IT IT'S TIME AND I APPRECIATE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. FOR THIS TYPE OF LEGISLATION TO THAT YOU'RE HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AYE I WAS THEM. UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT VAGUE BUT I THINK WE COULD BENEFIT FROM SPECIFIC SPECIFICALLY WHAT ARE THE FISCAL IT FINANCIAL ISSUES ARE CHALLENGES THAT YOU SEE. AND AS MUCH DETAIL AS YOU CAN PROVIDE ON THE IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES TO WE HAVE OUR EYES WIDE OPEN ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE POTENTIALLY DEALING WITH. SO FROM THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA PERSPECTIVE ALL OF OUR CENTERS ARE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT WE ARE -- THAT ALL OF THE YOU SEE HEALTH CENTERS ARE -- PRIMARY CARE HOMES FOR FOR STUDENTS -- THE BILL CURRENTLY PROVIDES FOR TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PER CENTER AND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND TO THE SYSTEM WE DON'T THINK THAT'S ADEQUATE GIVEN. OF THE KIND OF BAD CHANGES WE MIGHT MAKE NEED TO MAKE IN TERMS OF SECURITY AND SOME OTHER. THING SUB SO AND THE STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS ARE FUNDED THROUGH GENERAL FUND. THROUGH PHILANTHROPY AND THROUGH STUDENT FEES AND SO I'M ANYTHING THAT'S NOT COVERED -- BY -- GRANT DOLLARS WOULD BE A GENERAL FUND OR STUDENT FEE COST -- AND THE BILL IS -- PROVIDES AFTER -- TWENTY TWENTY TWO IT'S IT'S SILENT WHICH MEANS THOSE ONGOING COSTS WOULD BE UNIVERSITY AS STUDENT FEE COST AND STUDENT AND OR GENERAL FUND COST AND OUR STUDENT BODY IS VERY SENSITIVE TO INCREASING IN FEES. AND THIS BODY IS VERY SENSITIVE TO HAVING ANY GENERAL FUND BECAUSE ADDED TO OUR BASE -- BUDGET. SO -- AYE I THINK I'M A TOP OF THE LINE THAT'S PROBABLY -- ARE CONCERNED THE BILL HAS GONE THROUGH SEVERAL ITERATIONS SO DEPENDING UPON ITERATION OUR CONCERNS HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT IF THIS HAS BEEN THE MOST RECENT -- THAT VERSION OF THE BILL IN THESE ARE. AYE CONCERNS NOW AS ITS FIRST IMPLEMENTATION WE'VE HEARD IT. ARE REPORTED THAT -- ABORTION -- BY MEDICATION SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE THIRTY MINUTES AWAY THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY TRUE FOR ALL THE UC'S IT MAY BE TRUE AGGREGATE IF YOU LOOK AT EVERY SYSTEM IN. DIVIDED BY SOME NUMBER BUT WE HAVE SOME ABORTION SERVICES WITHIN EVEN WALKING DISTANCE WAS SOME CAMPUSES SOME CAMPUSES IT IS THAT I'M TEN TO FIFTEEN MINUTES. HIGH RIGHTS SOME IT MAY EVEN BE A FIFTEEN MINUTE DRIVE SO IT'S IT'S NOT THAT -- I'M WE DO THINK THAT THAT THAT THE COMMUNITY ACCESS IS THERE THERE ARE SOME THINGS I THINK WE COULD PROBABLY DO TO IMPROVE ON THAT -- AND SO -- I THINK -- IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTATION WE JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE -- FIRST THAT THE COSTS ARE ARE ARE. PROBABLY ARE ARE ARE TOPPLING CONCERNED ALONG [inaudible] PURITY AND I MEAN I I DO THINK THAT IT'S GOING TO BE -- SUPPORTING THE PROGRAM ONGOING THE FUNDING -- TO SORT OUT THE PROGRAM WAS GOING TO BE GREAT TO BUY EQUIPMENT INTO THE TRAINING THAT WE APPRECIATE OF ABOUT. I WOULD I IMAGINE THAT OVER TIME THAT STAFF WILL LEAVE -- AND GO TO OTHER OPPORTUNITIES. BECAUSE FRANKLY WILD CAESAR'S GREAT PLACE TO WORK THERE PROBABLY ARE BUT OPTIONS FOR EMPLOYEES FORCING PEOPLE OF MEDICAL DEGREES. TO GO ELSEWHERE AND RETAINING AND RECRUITING STAFF -- IN RETRAINING THE STAFF WILL BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF ONGOING COST AND THEN THE LIABILITY THAT KEEPS ITS MAY BE INCURRING IT YOU KNOW THE BREAST ARE MINIMAL SO I DON'T WANT TO OVERSTATE IT BUT BUT THERE IS GOING TO BE A RISK AND IT'S GOING TO BE A LIABILITY RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. AND THE WAY WE A COST WORKS ON LIABILITY AT CSU AS A CAPSULE PAY A CERTAIN AMOUNT OUT OF THEIR POCKET FIFTY TWO FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS EXPENSIVE CAMPUS IN THEIR THEIR INSURANCE PACKAGE THEY HAVE. BEEN THE CSU PAUL SOUP CHICKEN AFTERWARDS. PICKING UP THE NEXT FIVE MILLIONS LAST THE SYSTEM WIDE POLICY WHICH COULD CONNECTS BY MILLION DOLLARS AFTER THAT'LL GO TO THE SYSTEM WIDE INSURANCE WILL THEN TAP AND SO -- AGAIN LOW RISK WE DON'T KNOW WE HAVE NO EXPERIENCE WITH THIS BUT ABORTION BUT COULDN'T TELL YOU THAT TO BE. ONE ZERO I I REALLY CAN TELL YOU BUT THAT THAT IS A CONCERN AYE PIPER. WATER THAT HIGHLIGHT DRESSED. AND MAY I RESPOND AS WELL WERE OF SURE I AYE I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE MAY I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR OUR GOOD AUTHOR BUT YEAH YOU DON'T MIND WHILE WERE ON THIS. TO THE AREA THINK ACT MISTER CHAIR. LINK SERDES GO AHEAD CENTER SO THAT THIS IS WONDERFUL TO HEAR FROM YOU SEE IS THAT THAT THE COST IS A PROBLEM WE HAVE NOT HEARD THAT BEFORE SO WE WOULD LOVE TO KNOW WHAT THE NUMBER IS. WE HAVE WORKED WITH OUR FUNDERS TO MAKE SURE ALL COSTS WERE COVERED SO IF YOU CAN GIVE US THE NUMBER THAT YOU THINK YOU NEED WE WOULD MUCH APPRECIATE THAT. A NUMBER TO THE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND WILL GO TOWARD SET UP COSTS. WOULD TAKE THREE YEARS THEY WILL HAVE THREE YEARS TO IMPLEMENT THE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND EACH INSTITUTION YOU HEARD FOLKS TALK ABOUT THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR HOTLINE THAT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS COULD GO. TO A TO TRAIN PEOPLE TO ANSWER THE PHONES BUT AS FAR AS ON GOING AFTER THREE YEARS STATE LAW PROTECTS INDIVIDUAL EXCUSE ME PRIVATE INSURANCE INCLUDING HEALTH INSURANCE AND MEDICARE ALL. ALREADY REIMBURSED FOR ABORTION BERKELEY SHIP REIMBURSES A 100% WITH NO QUE CO PAY OR DEDUCTIBLE MEDI CAL HAS AN EASY ONLINE APPLICATION PROCESS THAT COVERS THE MEDICATION AT SIXTY SEVEN DOLLARS. AND THE PROCEDURE FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SO THAT SO I'M JUST TRYING TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THE COSTS WILL BE COVERED HALF OF C. ISSUE CLINICS ALREADY ARE MEDI CAL PROVIDERS. THANK YOU CENTER A THINK YOU AND AND JUST IN FOLLOWING UP. THE I THINK US US ARMS IF YOU NOT IN THE HEAD BACK AND FORTH LIKE THERE WAS MAYBE SOMETHING I'D LIKE TO KNOW WAS WAS. THAT INFORMATION NOT THE CASE ABOUT MEDI CAL COVERAGE OR WHEN WE ARE SAYING MEDICAL COVERAGE TALK ABOUT FAMILY PACKED HOWEVER CABS ARE FAMILY PACK. PROVIDERS -- WHICH IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THAN MEDI CAL -- SO THAT THAT THAT WAS THE QUICKEST NOTHING. OKAY THANK YOU AND FOR IF THERE IS FOLLOW UP NOW UNDER EXISTING SERVICES FOR A STUDENT WHO GOES. TO A FACILITY IN TEN FIFTEEN MINUTES AWAY -- IT WOULD SAY THERE IS A FOLLOW UP NEEDS SOMETHING DOESN'T GO RIGHT. DO THEY GO CAMPAIGN AND DO THEY GO NOW GENERALLY TO THE HEALTH CENTER OR DO THEY GO BACK. TO SAY IT'S A PLANNED PARENTHOOD WHERE THEY GO TO SO IS THAT AN ADDITIONAL AYE I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STUDENT GETS CARE. WHERE DOES THAT HAPPEN NOW AND HOW WITH THE BILL AND YOU UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE YOUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THAT CONDITION WILL CURRENTLY THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA DOES HAVE A TWENTY FOUR HOUR HOTLINE ADVICE HOTLINE FOR ANY STUDENT EXPERIENCING EMERGENCY? IF A STUDENT HAS I RECEIVED DAM IT IF THIS MEDICATION OR ANY OTHER MEDICATION AND HAVE THE SIDE EFFECT THEY WOULD MOST MATCH WE CALL THE PROVIDER THAT PROVE THAT GAVE THE MEDICATION. I'M ON WITH WITH THIS MEDICATION MANY TIMES THE ARE CRITICAL GYNECOLOGIST THAT GAVE THE MEDICATION DOES HAVE TWENTY FOUR HOURS EVER SO THEY WOULD KNOW. THAT PATIENTS PARTICULAR CASE BUT BUT GENERALLY IF THAT WERE NOT AND IF THAT IF THAT WERE NOT AVAILABLE THE EMERGENCY. AND THROUGH JUST DO REGULAR -- LOCAL EMERGENCY ROOM WOULD BE -- THE RECOURSE THAT THE STUDENT CENTER WOULD NOT BE -- THE RECOURSE -- HAVE FOR THAT I I ALSO JUST WANTED JUST -- TO MENTION THAT IN TERMS OF OF BILLING THE UNIVERSITY IS NOT SET UP THE STUDENT NOW SENDS DO NOT BILL. AND THEY DO NOT BILL -- CURRENTLY AND RUPTURES -- WOULD ADD COST ON GOING. THANK YOU IF I'M MAY I I I HAVE A QUESTION JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT WHITE Y. Y. WITH THIS -- TAIL BILLY. WELL IF AFTER TWENTY TWENTY TWO THAT JUST ASSUMING WE WORK OUT ALL THE PRE AMOUNTS OF MONEY THAT NEEDED -- LET'S JUST SAY THAT THAT HAPPENS AT TWENTY TWENTY TWO IT IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STUDENT HEALTH CENTER TO PAY FOR THIS ON GOING I BELIEVE IT'S THE AUTHORS POSITION THAT THE STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS CAN BILL. TO COVER THOSE COSTS WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS WE DO NOT GO -- BECAUSE IT ADDS AYE IT ADDS TO ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OVER ALL FORMER STUDENT HOW THINGS IN SO AND WE'RE NOT -- AT AT AT THIS POINT OURS ARE STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS ARE NOT FAMILY PACK PROVIDERS ARE MEDI CAL PROVIDERS IN AND DON'T BILL ANY. FORM OF INSURANCE AT ALL. THANK YOU IF CAN I CONTINUE YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU AND TO OUR ARE SENATOR THANK YOU -- FOR CHIMING A BIT EARLIER AYE AYE [inaudible] UNITS IT. I'D OF THE IS A STRAIGHTFORWARD DEL I I M.. I'D YOU HAVE A PROVISION THAT. PROVIDES THAT AFTER TWENTY THAT UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY TWO THERE'S NO. NOTHING IS CHAPTER LAOS AYE REQUIRES THE PUBLIC UNIVERSITY TO UTILIZE GENERAL FUND MONIES ARE STUDENT FEES FOR PATIENT PORSCHE. BEFORE JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO WHY THE PROVISION BEFORE JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY TWO BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE PRIVATELY FUNDED. BUT WHAT HAPPENS AFTER TWENTY TWENTY TWO I'VE LAID OUT THE WAYS OF THE UNIVERSITIES CAN CHARGE OR BILL FOR THIS. ARE WE HAVE BEEN OPENED TO HELPING THEM SET UP BILLING TO MAKE SURE THAT STUDENT FEES WILL HAVE TO BE USED FOR THIS -- MAYBE DIFFERENT OPINION ON THEIR PART ON HOW WE CAN DO IT BUT IT'S IT'S REALLY -- YOU CAN BECOME A MEDIC HELP PROVIDE WE'VE WE'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION IN SENATE EDUCATION ABOUT THE LACK OF UC'S NC ISSUES ACCEPTING ANY KIND. OF HEALTH CARE COVERAGE WHEN FOR WHATEVER -- ILLNESS OR WHATNOT SO THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT MEDICAID ABORTION OKAY THANK YOU AND I JUST WHEN YOU SAY YOU'VE LAID OUT WHAT% HAPPENS AFTER [inaudible] TWENTY TWENTY TO WHAT I WAS ITS REFERRING TO THEY LAID OUT EARLIER WHEN I WAS ANSWERING WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT NINE THE BILL IT IS NOT IN THE BILL IT'S RIGHT HERE IN FRONT OF ME IS THERE IS SO. IS YOUR IN ANTICIPATION THAT. GENERAL FUND MONIES ARE STUDENT FEES AFTER TWENTY TWENTY TWO YOU YOU HAVE THAT PROVISION SO THAT THEY COULD POSSIBLY BE USED NOTED. THAT BAD THAT HAS NEVER BEEN THE INTENTION OF THE BILL THAT SHOULD BE OPEN TO AND I YOU KNOW I DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THIS BEFORE SITE NOT TRYING TO SPRING THIS IS THE HIDDEN SPRING ON THE AUTHOR THING BUT I'M NOT SURE WHY THEIR NEEDS TO BE ANY MENTION. OF BEFORE JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO IN THE BELL IF THE INTENT IS TO ENSURE THAT. GOING FORWARD IN PERPETUITY NO GENERAL FUND MONIES ARE STUDENT FEES WOULD BE USED FOR THE S. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR A YEAR AND A HALF AND WE ARE ALWAYS OPEN FOR THE DISCUSSIONS -- I APPRECIATE THAT AND AND I AM AND THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE VERY BENEFICIAL BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE A STATUS QUO IN TERMS OF POLICY ABOUT WHAT MONIES AND FEES COULD. COULD GO -- TO THIS SERVICE. ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE COST CONCERNS THAT YOU SEE -- AND CSU HAVE HAVE BOTH RAISED TO S. AND IMPLEMENTATION. AND AGAIN -- TAKE A STEP BACK TO THE THE NEED FOR THE BILL WE JUST HEARD TESTIMONY AT LEAST FROM YOU SEE THAT -- IN A AND I THINK FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT WITHIN. MOST OF THIS CSU AND UC CAMPUSES ARE. IN AREAS THAT HAVE SOME POPULATION AND THAT THERE MAY BE A TENER FIFTEEN MINUTE BUS RIDE. TO A FACILITY THAT COULD PROVIDE THIS. AND GIVEN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES WHY NOT LEAVE THIS UP TO YOU SEE IN CS YOU TO LOOK AT THEIR OWN CAMPUS NEEDS. WHAT THEY DO HAVE THEIR OWN COMMUNITY IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A LOCAL CONTROL ARGUMENT -- WE'D TELL YOU SEE AND WE TRY TO TELL YOU SEE AND SEE IF YOU ALL THE TIME TO DO BUT WE ALSO SHOULD PRACTICE SOME RESTRAINT IN THAT WHY NOT LET AN INDIVIDUAL CAMPUS. OR WOULD THE REGENTS OR THE TRUSTEES FOR CS YOU MAKE THAT DECISION -- AS I LOOK AT THIS I WOULD SAY A COUPLE OF THINGS ONE I WOULD SAY RECENTLY THE A LEGISLATOR JUST LEGISLATURE JUST VOTED ON A BILL MANDATING THAT SEE ISSUES AND UC'S. HOW PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH SO WE DO MANDATE ALL THE TIME IT'S KIND OF WHAT WE DO IS A BODY BUT NUMBER TWO I WOULD SAY MY WITNESS WHO TESTIFIED -- FROM YOU SEE OUR AND TALKED ABOUT THE DIFFICULTY SHE HAD GIVING TO AN OFF CAMPUS PROVIDER. WHEN YOU ARE ON CAMPUS AND I DID NOT DO COLLEGE THAT WAY I WAS MARRIED AND WORKING FULL TIME SO I DID NOT LIVE ON CAMPUS? BUT EVEN THAT EVEN THAT MY OWN EXPERIENCE YOU BECOME VERY COMPARABLE WITH YOUR COLLEGE CAMPUS YOU BECOME COMFORTABLE BEING ABLE TO GO SOMEPLACE AND ASK THEM FOR ADVICE. HAVING MEDICAID ABORTION A PROVIDED ON CAMPUS AT THE HEALTH CENTERS GIVES THE STUDENT THE ACCESS THAT THEY NEED. YOU CAN ONLY HAVE A MEDICAID ABORTION UP TO TEN WEEKS MOST WOMEN DON'T EVEN FIND OUT THEY'RE PREGNANT INTO THE FIVE OR SIX WEEKS ALONG. SO TIMELINESS AS OF THE ISSUE AND YOURE ALREADY IN A STRESSFUL SITUATION AND HAVING TO THINK ABOUT WHERE DO I GO WHAT DO I DO TO I HAVE A CARD WHY NOT HAVE A CAR. EVEN IT'S ONLY FIVE OR TEN MILES AWAY. IT'S STILL LOGISTICALLY DIFFICULT WHEN YOU ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING WITH WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO TO BE ABLE TO WALK ACROSS CAMPUS. AND GET SOME ANSWERS IS IT'S ABOUT ACCESS IT'S A CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED RIGHT BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED RIGHT. IS IT REALLY RIGHT. CAN I AM THE RIGHT NOW CAN A STUDENT GO TO A HEALTH CENTER AND ASK ALL THOSE QUESTIONS IT'S JUST THE MEDICATION THAT THEY CAN OBTAIN THAT IS CORRECT OKAY I I WOULD. REALLY BE VERY GRATEFUL AND HOPE THAT THE PROVISION ABOUT JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO COULD BE REMOVED -- AND THAT WE LOOK AT THESE COST ISSUES WE'VE BEEN QUITE THE WATCHDOG HAVE PARTICULAR YOU SEE BUT ALSO CSU. FOR ON THE ENTIRE TIME I'VE BEEN HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE AND EVERY SINGLE TIME WE IMPOSE UPON THEM. AND AND WITHOUT MUCH FLEXIBILITY WHAT THEY NEED TO DO AND WE DON'T BACK IT UP WITH ALL THE RESOURCES THEY NEED OR THOUGHT SAM LOCAL FLEXIBILITY I THINK WE'RE KIND OF TAKING SOME STEPS BACKWARDS. AND THIS IS COMING FROM MEMBER WHO IS PRO CHOICE. SO I IT IS TRYING TO DETERMINE WHAT WE MIGHT BEST BE ABLE TO DO THEIR THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS. YOU'RE VERY WELCOME [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] MR BABSON. I WANT DOT EXPLORE -- THE RISK THE NEED AND THE CSU LIABILITY AND I WANT TO FIRST OF ALL. THIS IS ABOUT ME -- MEDICATED ABORTION THIS IS ABOUT ARGUE. FORTY SIX ARE YOU OR ARE YOU NOT. CONCERNED ABOUT THE RISK OF CS USE OR THE UC'S THE HAVING THE POTENTIAL FOR LIABILITY AND RISK WITH RESPECT TO THE SIDE EFFECTS OF A MEDICAID ABORTION. AND THAT THAT IS YES YOU'RE CONCERNED HEARD. WIENER BUSINESS SEEMS TO BE CONFUSING I THINK. SIGNIFICANT SO I WOULD ASK. ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT THE HEMORRHAGING AND THE POTENTIAL FOR PROBLEMS WITH THE USE OF A MEDICATED ABORTION. THE I THINK FOR THE C. ISSUES PERSPECTIVE. IF THE HEALTH CENTERS. ARE PROVIDING A SERVICE TO STUDENTS TOM. IN THERE THE INTENT IS THAT THERE IT'S FROM MONDAY TO FRIDAY. NINE TO FIVE AND FIVE OR EIGHTY FIVE ABOUT BALLOTS -- CRITTERS SURE THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE BEING TREATED SUCCESSFULLY AND WHEN I WHEN WE DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY. TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF THE STUDENT -- WE IDENTIFY PRETTY QUICKLY WE MAKE SURE THAT THEY GO TO THE RIGHT PLACE. THERE THERE IS A CONCERN THERE IS A RISK IT IS MINIMAL THAT YES THERE IS COMPETITORS A RISK AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT STUDENTS. ARE ADDRESSED AND APPROPRIATELY DIRECTED TO WHERE THEY CAN BE TO THE PARTICULAR OF APPROPRIATELY. YOUR YOUR ASSESSMENT OF A MINIMAL RISK -- IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. PARTICULARLY MEDICAID ABORTION AND ARGUE FOR EIGHTY SIX DOES HAVE -- ELEVATED RISK WITH RESPECT TO A A COMPARATIVE [inaudible] METHODOLOGY OF GETTING AN ABORTION OUT WHAT CAUSES YOU TO DETERMINE THE RISK. IS A MINIMAL. A FREQUENT WAS GOING UP THE RESEARCH THAT WAS PROVIDED TO US BY THE UCS HALF -- AND DR GROSSMAN DID COME TO THE HEALTH CENTER DIRECTORS AND DID PRESENT THAT AS WELL -- SO AYE I'M NOT I'M NOT BY ANY MEANS AN EXPERT ARE YOU FOUR EIGHTY SIX THE RISK ASSOCIATED ARE I'M RELYING ON THE DAY OF THAT TALK REST BRIGHTEST GOING ANSWER THAT AS WELL OF COURSE. YEAH JUST AYE AGAIN AS AS DR GROSSMAN PROVIDED TESTIMONY IN THE PREVIOUS ON COMMITTEE HEARING -- ONLY ABOUT 3% OF PEOPLE GET MEDICATION ABORTION WILL NEED ADDITIONAL TREATMENT AND LESS THAN HALF OF 1% WOULD NEED. SIT TREATMENT AT AT IT MAYBE AT A HOSPITAL SO IT'S IT'S QUITE A SMALL PERCENTAGE. LIKE TO ADDRESS OR HAVE THE CSU IS TALK TO TO ME ABOUT THE NEED AND THAT AGAIN I KNOW WHAT KIND OF PUT YOU ON THE SPOT WHERE WITH RESPECT TO THIS BUT A I YOU KNOW THIS IS A THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT MATTER HERE WHO WITH AGAIN AT THAT CAN YOU ASSESS THE NEED FOR THIS IT I MEAN. IF THE INFORMATION WE HAVE ABOUT ABORTION TO CHEMICAL ABORTION PROVIDERS ARE WITHIN FIVE MILES OR SO -- THAT. SOMETHING SOMETHING LIKE THAT THE SHORTEST DISTANCE IS OF A MILE AND A HALF THERE ARE SOME. CAMPUSES THAT HAVE AT SOME AVAILABILITY MAYBE TEN MILES. I'M AWAY WHAT IS THE OVER RIDING COMPELLING NEED. TO PUT THIS -- PRESCRIPTION AND MEDICAID ABORTION ON THE CAMPUS ITSELF. IF THERE IS CLOSE PROXIMITY FOR SIMILAR SERVICE. I DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE. THE BILL WOULD ANSWER IT -- I REALLY LEARNED THAT THE AUTHOR TO MISTER CHAIRMAN I LEAVE -- THE BERKELEY STUDENTS THAT ARE PART OF THE CENTERS ON A CLUB ON THE THE CAMPUS A PARTICULAR PETITION WENT TO UC BERKELEY LEADERSHIP AND ASKED TO HAVE THE SERVICE PROVIDED ON THEIR CAMPUS. AND THEY WERE DENIED THAT SO THEY CAME TO ME AND ASKED IF WE COULD DO SOMETHING TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY STUDENT. HAS ACCESS TO MEDICATED I THINK YOU SAID CHEMICAL THAT WE'RE NOT WE DON'T KNOW OF OF OF WHAT A CHEMICAL ABORTIONISTS BUT MEDICATED ABORTION SO THAT'S WHERE THE NEED FOR THIS CAME FROM IT CAME RIGHT FROM THE STUDENTS. I AM I THINK YOU PROBABLY -- ADDRESSED BE -- THE LIABILITY ISSUE BUT YOU. IF YOU DO UNDERSTAND THAT DISPENSING A PARDON MEDICAL ABORTION WITH THE POTENTIAL EVEN WITH A HEMORRHAGE IN A CIRCUMSTANCE IN WHICH BY YOUR OWN TESTIMONY THE DUBBED REMEDY FOR THIS IS -- THE EMERGENCY ROOM -- ARE YOU [inaudible] HOW? COULD YOU SCOPE. YOUR LIABILITY CONCERNS ON A SCALE. A LOT OF LIABILITY MODELA LIABILITY -- I MEAN IT'S GOING TO KEEP YOU AWAKE AT NIGHT WILL THERE BE CONCERNS WITH RESPECT TO THAT ACTIVITY OR NOT. SO I THINK THAT THE THE CHALLENGE THERE THAT TWO THINGS A LIABILITY CERTAINLY THERE'S HOPE THERE'S A RISK AND I THINK THAT -- FOR US THE RISK WOULD MEAN THAT THOSE STUDENTS WOULD NEED TO BE SEEN IN AN EMERGENCY ROOM -- IT'SNOT THE HEALTH CENTERS ARE NOT EQUIPPED -- TO BUT MOST OF OUR HEALTH CENTERS WE WORKED DIRECTLY WITH PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND THAT'S FRANKLY WHERE -- OUR RELATIONSHIPS ARE TO FOR THE SERVICE SO -- WE'VE NOT HAD TO DEAL WITH IT -- THE CONCERN OF COURSE IS IS WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH RISK THERE WILL BE. I'M IN TERMS OF MEETING DEMAND THEY WERE NOT SURE THERE'S AN UNMET NEED -- ON MOST OF OUR CAMPUSES WE'VE CERTAINLY TRAPPED ON THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT COME INTO OUR HEALTH CENTER. AND THE ONES THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY -- REFERRED TO PLANNED PARENTHOOD FOR THIS FOR THE SERVICE AND WE WE DON'T SEE THAT THERE'S A HUGE NEED FOR THE S. -- ALTHOUGH WERE SUPPORTIVE OF THE SERVICE BECAUSE WE SO A TAPE THE SERVICE WITH OUR COMMUNITY PROVIDERS. MISTER CHAIR MASK A QUESTION YET DO ANY OF YOUR STERN'S COURT CURRENTLY HAVE TO SEEK OF TREATMENT FROM A EMERGENCY ROOM NOW [inaudible] OF COURSE. SO THIS WOULD BE NOT ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FROM A STUDENT WHO HAS TO GO TO AN EMERGENCY ROOM WHO MAYBE WENT TO THE HEALTH CARE CENTER. FOR SOMETHING ELSE. I I THINK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE FOR STUDENT FOR EXAMPLE BROKE AWAY COR THERE'S SOMETHING THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH THERE THERE THERE'S ALWAYS SOME. LEVEL OF OF I THINK POTENTIAL USE FOR EMERGENCY ROOM FOR EVEN SOME OF THIS THAT THE SLIGHTEST OR UNEXPECTED KINDS OF INCIDENCES. I DO THINK ON THE ISSUE OF LIABILITY OUR OUR OUR OFFICE -- HAVE NOT SCALED -- THAT THE RISK I I LOOK AT LIABILITY -- FROM MORE OF A PERSPECTIVE. WHAT HAPPENS -- LEGALLY IF ONE OF THESE CASES ONE OF THE ONE IN A MILLION GO WRONG BUT WITH THE UNIVERSITY'S LIABILITY EXPOSURE BE AND AND I DON'T KNOW. I HAVEN'T HEARD OF A ARE WE HAVEN'T SCALE THAT BUT IT'S NOT ZERO IT'S NOT NOTHING BUT IT IT'S IT'S SOMETHING THAT -- WE HAVEN'T SH OUR SELF INSURED SO IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG ON ANY OF THE PROCEDURES PROVIDED AT THE STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS WE WOULD HAVE SOME RISK. THERE IF THE PROCEDURE IS PROVIDED SOMEWHERE ELSE IT'S LESS RISK FOR A FEW MINUTES. BUT I DON'T KNOW. THAT THAT NUMBER I APPRECIATE THAT -- BUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLORE THIS AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY I REPRESENT -- FRESNO STATE UNIVERSITY -- HAVE VERY GOOD AND VERY CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE EXECUTIVES THERE AND WITH THE STUDENTS INCLUDING -- PRESIDENTS OF THE STUDENT BODY OTHERS I'M IN A LOT OF FRESNO STATE. AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT THAT FRESNO STATE A HAS SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS. AND THEY ARE IN ONLINE WITH THE RISK THEY NEED AND THE LIABILITY AND FRANKLY I THINK OUR OUR OWN UNIVERSITY WOULD RATHER THIS NOT BE PUT IN FRONT OF THEM PRESENTLY -- AND YET THE I UNDERSTAND WHY THEY AND YOU ARE. A LITTLE RELUCTANT AND DIRECT TESTIMONY BUT I DO THINK THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND LIABILITY AND I DON'T THINK THAT THE NEED HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED THANK YOU. ANY OTHER EQUIPMENT QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE SCENE -- NINE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE SENATOR LATER I WOULD THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THIS UP ROBUST DISCUSSION I APPRECIATE BOTH SIDES OF THE EQUATION WEIGHING IN ON WHAT THEY THINK. I AM I DO KNOW THAT THE OPPOSITION SAID THAT NOT ONE PRESIDENT WANTS THIS ON THEIR CAMPUS -- I HAVE NOT HAD -- AN OPPORTUNITY AS SHE APPARENTLY HAD TO SPEAK WITH EVERY PRESIDENT I HAVE TALKED TO A NUMBER OF PRESIDENTS AS I'VE TALKED TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UC AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE C. ISSUE. NEITHER HAD NEITHER OF THEM OR OTHERS THAT I'VE TALKED TO HAVE EXPRESSED THAT THEY DO NOT WANT THIS ON THEIR CAMPUS. THOSE ARE ONLY THE ONES THAT I'VE TALKED TO I'M NOT SURE WHO THE OPPOSITION HAD TALKED. TO THIS IS REALLY IS ABOUT ACCESS SURE THAT A WOMAN CAN CHOOSE WHEN SHE DECIDES TO INCORPORATE A FAMILY INTO HER LIFE. AND UNTIL WOMEN HAVE THAT RIGHT TO HAVE ACCESS TO THIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT AND CHOOSE WHEN THEY INCORPORATE A FAMILY WOMAN WILL ALWAYS BE PUSHED DOWN WE WILL NOT BE EQUAL MEMBERS OF SOCIETY. SO THIS IS A BILL ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT ALL WOMEN HAVE THE RIGHT TO MOVE FORWARD IN THEIR LIFE WHEN THEY SO CHOOSE TO AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY BOAT. THANK YOU SENATOR -- I WANT TO THANK ALL THE WITNESSES. ALL THE I STUDENTS WHO HAVE COME. AND AND GIVEN THEIR TESTIMONY -- I REPRESENT RIVERSIDE WHERE THE CAMPUS OF UC RIVERSIDE IS. I RECOGNIZE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THIS BILL. AND I LIKE MISTER PATTERSON REACHED OUT. TO MY CAMPUS AND SPOKE DIRECTLY WITH THE PHYSICIAN IN CHARGE OF OUR CLINIC. AND I KNOW THAT THERE IS STILL WORK TO BE DONE. ON THIS BILL -- AND KNOW THAT THERE WILL CONTINUE AND ASK THE AUTHOR TO CONTINUE TO BE IN CONVERSATION. WITH BOTH CSU AND YOU SEE. AND I'VE BEEN TRYING I'VE THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD -- I WILL SUPPORT IT. AND I WILL LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONTINUING DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE AUTHOR AND UC AND CSU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR [inaudible] SO -- NO. THINK THERE'S BEEN MOVED SAKE I MISTER LEVINE AND SECOND BY MISTER LOW. AND MADAM SECRETARY IF YOU WOULD CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE MEDINA AYE. MEDINA AYE BAKER [inaudible] ARAMBULA [inaudible] BLOOM [inaudible] CHAVEZ. CHAVEZ NO IRWIN. KILEY LEVINE. LEVINE AYE LOW. LOW AYE PATTERSON. PATTERSON NO QUIRK SILVA SANTIAGO WEBER. THREE TO THAT BILL IS ON CALL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU MEMBERS. MOVING NOW TO ITEM NUMBER. FIVE MISTER HILL [inaudible] YOU CAN. WELCOME SENATOR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS S. B. FOURTEEN ZERO SIX GIVES THE FIFTEEN EXISTING COMMUNITY COLLEGES WITHIN PILOT PROGRAMS. TWO ADDITIONAL YEARS TO ENROLL NEW STUDENTS AND ENSURE THAT THE LA O. WILL HAVE A MORE ROBUST POOL. OF PARTICIPANTS FROM WHICH TO EVALUATE THE PROGRAM'S EFFECTIVENESS AND DEVELOPER. AND WHETHER AND HOW THE PROGRAM SHOULD BE EXTENDED OR EXPANDED. IF WE DON'T PASS THIS BILL THE PILOT PROGRAM SCHOOLS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ENROLL STUDENTS AFTER THIS YEAR. TWENTY TWO OTHER STATES ALREADY ALLOW COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO OFFER BACCALAUREATE DEGREE PROGRAMS THIS BILL IS ABOUT THE FUTURE WORKFORCE IN OUR STATE I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE MEMBERS THE BILL. WITNESSES -- AND SUPPORT TWO MINUTES TO TWO WITNESSES. YES SOME I'M CONSTANCE CAROL CHANCELLOR OF THE SAN DIEGO COMMUNITY COLLEGE. DISTRICT THEM THANK YOU FOR LETTING US COME I BROUGHT WITH ME -- A HANDOUT WHICH IS FOR EACH OF YOU ON THE COMMITTEE SO THAT YOU CAN. A REVIEW THE INFORMATION I'M PRESENTING. THE BILL SENATE BILL FOURTEEN NO SIX IS SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE BY THE LEAGUE THE COMMUNICATION LEAGUE FOR CALIFORNIA. AND THERE ARE SIX QUICK POINTS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE. THE THE FIRST IS THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE BACCALAUREATE PROGRAM -- IS APPROPRIATE TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE MISSION. AND YOU'LL SEE IN MY PAPER THAT A GROWING NUMBER OF WORK FORCE FIELDS NOW REQUIRE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE BACCALAUREATE. OR A BACCALAUREATE DEGREE INSTEAD OF THE ASSOCIATE DEGREE. MISS SECOND POINT IS THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE QUALIFIED TO OFFER THESE TO GREASE IN MANY CASES. OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ALREADY OFFER THESE PROGRAMS AT THE ASSOCIATE. DEGREE LEVEL THE FACULTY THE EQUIPMENT FACILITIES ARE ALREADY IN PLACE AND THE THE QUALITY IS EXCELLENT. THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE BACCALAUREATE PROGRAMS MISSES IMPORTANT DO NOT DUPLICATE. ANY PROGRAMS OFFERED BY OR PLAN TO BUY ANY OF THE PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES IN CALIFORNIA. CDVA CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM AND THE UC SYSTEM DO NOT OFFER OF THESE TYPES OF DEGREES IN DENTAL HYGIENE RESPIRATORY CARE AND THE LIKE. THE FOURTH POINT IS THAT THESE COMMUNITY COLLEGE BACCALAUREATE PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO SERVE. COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. NOT OTHER TYPES OF STUDENTS BUT COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO ARE EITHER ALREADY ENROLLED IN ASSOCIATE DEGREE PROGRAMS AT THEIR COMMUNITY COLLEGES OR HAVE COME TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN ORDER TO PURSUE A FIELD. THAT THAT IS NOT OF AVAILABLE A A TO THEM OTHERWISE. THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE BACCALAUREATE PROGRAMS MY FIFTH POINT OUR COST EFFECTIVE THE ENTIRE FOUR YEARS ONLY CAUSED HIM THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY DOLLARS. WHICH IS A VERY IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION -- TO OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES WHO ARE NOT WEALTHY. AND SIX AND LAST THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. ARE NOW GRADUATING STUDENTS FROM THEIR PROGRAMS WHEN THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S REPORT CAME OUT. OF IT CAME OUT BEFORE THE FIRST GROUP OF GRADUATES AND IF YOU WILL TURN. TO OF THE LAST PAGE OF MY HAND YOU WILL SEE THAT NINE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. HAVE ALREADY HAD THEIR FIRST GRADUATES -- THIS SO THIS SUMMER IN MAY AND JUNE. OF THE STUDENTS WILL NUMBER A TOTAL OF A HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE BECAUSE THESE ARE SMALL VOCATIONAL FOCUS PROGRAMS. ARE EMPLOYED IN JOBS. A IN THE FIELDS FOR WHICH THEY THEY TRAINED. JEFF INTO IF YOU COULD WRAP UP PLEASE AYE WELL OUT THERE ARE SIX COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT ARE ARE STILL HAVE FULL IN ROMANS BUT HAVE NOT GRADUATED STUDENTS YET. ANTELOPE VALLEY MAYOR COSTA MODESTO SANTA ANA RIA WE'LL HANDLE AND SOLANO TO THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS OF THIS BILL WILL WILL PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE BACCALAUREATE PROGRAM WHILE SERVING. A LOCAL NEED FOR STUDENTS TO TO OBTAIN JOBS [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] SUCH CHAIR MEDINA MEMBERS THANK YOU LARRY BELIEVES HIM THE PRESIDENT OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT ALL SEVENTY TWO DISTRICTS. SO FIRST BOTH THE C. E. O. BOARD AND THE TRUSTEE BOARD VOTED UNANIMOUSLY IN SUPPORT OF OF THIS BILL. HOT SO ONE ONE KEY POINT THE BILL REALLY ENHANCES AND IMPROVES THE DATA SET FOR ANALYSIS FOR ALL OF YOU AS LAWMAKERS -- TO LOOK AT THE PILOT'S EFFICACY. I WILL PROVIDE MORE STUDENTS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DATA SET BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF GRADUATES AND YOU COULD SEE WHERE WHAT HAPPENS TO THE GRADUATES. ARE EXTENDING THE SUNSET ALSO REMOVES WHAT WHAT IS REALLY A CONTAMINATING VARIABLE A OF OF THAT RESEARCH AND STUDY IT'S HARD TO MEASURE STUDENT DEMAND WHEN YOU HAVE SUCH A CONSTRAINED TIME PERIOD IN WHICH STUDENTS CAN ENROLL SO IT LAW IT WILL REALLY HELP US POLICYMAKERS TO A PROPER ANALYSIS -- AS AS CHANCELLOR CAROL SAID THE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE GRADUATES FROM YOU KNOW BAKER BAKERSFIELD TO THE SOUTH TO SHASTA TO THE NORTH -- DEMONSTRATE THE CAPACITY OF THE COLLEGES TO OFFER THESE TYPES OF DEGREES. THIS IS REALLY AN IMPORTANT POINT -- IT FILLS THE GAP THAT EXISTS FOR QUALITY PUBLIC OPTIONS. FOR PLAYSPAN LOW INCOME STUDENTS ESPECIALLY AND IT REALLY RIP WILL REDUCE THE THE POSSIBILITY THAT WILL HAVE. MORE CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE VICTIMS TO THE CORINTHIANS AND THE I. T. T. TAX THAT ALL OF YOU DEALT WITH AND AND KNOW THAT THAT'S SUCH A BIG PROBLEM -- ALSO THIS IS AN EQUITY ISSUE UNDERSERVED STUDENTS. OUR ARE OFTEN THOSE WHO WERE UNABLE TO RELOCATE TO PURSUE A BACCALAUREATE DEGREE. DOES PLACE POUND STUDENTS COULD BE SERVED BY THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHICH AS YOU KNOW OUR THROUGHOUT THE STATE I WANT TO END ON A TALE OF TWO STUDENTS ALICIA STEVENS WITH ALMOST SIXTY YEARS OLD WHEN SHE DECIDED TO RETURN TO SCHOOL. SHE'D BEEN WORKING SINCE HE WAS SIXTEEN YEARS OLD. A FRIEND OF HERS HAD BEEN AT A CORINTHIAN COLLEGE SHE ENROLLED. SHE COMPLETED HER PROGRAM IN ACCOUNTING SHE AMASSED TWENTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS IN DEBT. SHE WENT FOR A JOB INTERVIEW THEY TOLD HER THAT DEGREE IS FROM AN UNACCREDITED INSTITUTION IT IS WORTHLESS I'M SORRY IN CONTRAST. OR HAN BOK SHOCK WHO'S AN IMMIGRANT FROM TURKEY CAME HERE WHEN HE WAS TEN YEARS OLD. IS FAMILY STARTED A SMALL BUSINESS HE WORKED PART TIME AT THE BUSINESS FROM ELEVEN YEARS OLD. HE ATTENDED A FOR PROFIT INSTITUTE FOR TWO SEMESTERS AMASSED TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN STUDENT THAT. DIDN'T LIKE THE PROGRAM. HE GOT MARRIED AND HE WHAT HE TOLD ME THIS MORNING WAS HIS MY WIFE TOLD ME TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL. SO HE EARNED AN ASSOCIATE'S DEGREE IN GRAPHIC DESIGN AT SANTA MONICA COLLEGE AND THEN THANKS TO ALL OF YOU IN THE PILOT PROGRAM [inaudible] KEY. I ENTERED THE INTERACTION DESIGN BACCALAUREATE DEGREE PROGRAM GRADUATED THIS SPRING AND ALREADY WITH TWO OF HIS FELLOW GRADUATES. THEY HAVE STARTED A SMALL TECH STARTUP CALLED PLAYGROUND VISION THEY HAVE ENOUGH CLIENTS ALREADY HELPING HELPING THESE CLIENTS THAT THEY'VE REACHED INTO THE SECOND COHORT AT SANTA MONICA TO GET SOME OF THOSE STUDENTS TO HELP THEM OUT WITH THEIR CLIENTS.

LAST DECEMBER THE ILIO ISSUED AN INTERIM EVALUATION OF THE PROGRAM AND WHILE IT NOTED THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE MADE RAPID PROGRESS IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTATION. THERE IS LIMITED REVIEW OR CONSULTATION WITH THE CITY OF A CEO AND IN FACT SOME DEGREE PROGRAMS OR APPROVED OVER THE SEA ISSUES OBJECTIONS. CONTRADICTING BOTH THE LETTER AND SPIRIT OF THE INITIAL IMPLEMENTING LEGISLATION. I THE LA ALSO FOUND THAT A MAJORITY OF THE FIELD SELECTED FOR THE PILOT PROGRAM DID NOT REQUIRE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE FOR LICENSURE OR CERTIFICATION. WE HAVE STRONG CONCERNS THAT -- LIMITED STATE RESOURCE USED AND IN THAT MANNER. OF FINALLY WE UNDERSTAND THAT -- IT THERE'S LITTLE STUDENT OUTCOME DATA. THAT WOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE BY THE FINAL EVALUATION DATE TO HELP DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAM. AND AS THE LA O. REPORT ALSO NOTES EXTENDING THE SUNSET DATE WOULD WORK TO FURTHERING GREEN THE PROGRAM AND THE STATUS QUO POTENTIALLY TERM MAKING TERMINATING THE PILOT PROGRAM MORE DIFFICULT EVEN IF THE OUTCOME DATA SHOWS THAT THE PILOT WAS INEFFECTIVE FOR THESE REASONS WE ASK. FOR YOUR NO VOTE ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MICHAEL YOUNG WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WERE ALSO A REGRETFULLY OPPOSED THIS MEASURE I WANNA SEE MY COMMENTS OF THOSE OF THE CFC -- AND ALSO ADD THAT -- THE SCOPE OF THIS BILL SEEMS TO BE WHERE IT SHIFTS THE CORE MISSION OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES -- WE BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE A ROLE IN A VERY SIGNIFICANT ROLE TO PLAY IN TERMS OF CATERS WILL. FOR HIGHER EDUCATION -- HOWEVER WE DON'T WANT TO SEE EARTHY CONTINUE SHIFT OF RESOURCES GOING TOWARDS BACCALAUREATE PROP -- DEGREES AND IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM WHEN WE FOR THOSE RESOURCES WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATELY USED -- AT OUR UNIVERSITY SYSTEM SO FOR THOSE REASONS REPOSE. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. PUEDA COME FORWARD TO THE MY YOUR NAME. GROUP YOU'RE WITH. GOOD AFTERNOON STEPHANIE DOWDELL WITH THE FACULTY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES WOULD LIKE TO LINE OUR COMMENTS OF THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION. WE UNDERSTAND THE ARGUMENTS IN SUPPORT AND I'M GONNA STOP YOU JUST YOUR OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY ANY CLEANERS.

I REALLY WANT THANK YOU CENTER HOPE FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND FOR YOUR YOUR PASSION ON THIS I SHARE IT. HOW IMMENSELY -- CHEN AND I WERE A GREAT THAT RECIPIENTS OF UP FRESNO CITY COLLEGE. AND WHEN WE WERE VERY VERY YOUNG AND VERY NEWLY WED IT WAS A WONDERFUL WE APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH. OUR KIDS -- HAVE EXPERIENCED IT AS WELL WITHOUT CLASSES THAT THEY NEEDED UP WITH. CREDITS OF A GOOD REASON EASILY QUICKLY -- TRANSFER. OUR AYE OF GET TO REPRESENT THEIR WONDERFUL PLACES LIKE REALLY COMMITTEE COLLEGE IN CLOVIS CA A COLLEGE IN FRESNO CITY CUTS THANK YOU FOR THIS. THESE BACCALAUREUS ARE GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANT. IN HELPING STUDENTS WITH A CHOICE. TO DECIDE HOW THEY WANT TO GET THEIR EDUCATION AND SPECIFIC FIELDS THAT THEY LOVE. AND WHEN THEY GET A A BACCALAUREATE. THEIR EMPLOYABILITY GOES UP. AND THEIR PAYCHECKS. I THINK WE ALL WANT THAT AND I'M DELIGHTED TO BE ABLE TO VOTE YES JEFF JARVIS -- BAGS LOT OF YOU KNOW WHERE THIS BILL THIS PROCESS WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW STARTED WITH. S. B. EIGHT FIFTY WHICH WAS -- MARTY BLOCKS BILL I WAS A CO AUTHOR ON IT [inaudible] IN. RIGHT TECHNOLOGY YEAR AGO WE HAD AN UPDATE IN THE SUB. TO COMMITTEE WERE LOOKING AT ON RETURN ON INVESTMENT THERE'S A CONCERNS ABOUT HOW MANY. A PROGRAMS ACTUALLY ESTABLISHING PEOPLE GRADUATE IN THE COST FOR THEM. AND I APPRECIATE THAT WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE GRADUATE SCHOOL WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TOTAL POPULATION OF OUR COMMUNICABLE JISR SEE ISSUES. AS PRETTY SMALL. IN AMMAN OF STUDENTS TO COMPLETE THIS. I'M GONNA BE SUPPORTED A THREE YEARS GOING FORWARD -- BECAUSE ITHINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA I THINK IT MEETS A NEED -- AND I UNDERSTAND THAT -- JUST LIKE A LOT OF THINGS WE DO IN EDUCATION WE DID LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING. OUR GOING TO DASH BOARD TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE EDUCATION RELEVANT. I CASE DO TWELVE AND TIENEN TECHIE MANY COLLEGES -- YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S THIS WAS A BIG SEA CHANGE THAT TAKES AN EFFORT. I THINK THREE YEARS A TROLLEY PROBABLY GO. FOR I WILL BE HERE AROUND HERE THREE YEARS IN THIS IS DONE BUT I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THAT. YOU YOU TAKE US FORWARD CAUTIOUSLY TRIED TO IMPROVE THOSE NUMBERS SIGNIFICANTLY. IS I AM FEARFUL THAT -- AS THEY DON'T. THEN THERE'S GOING TO BE -- PROBABLY HEARING THREE YEARS FROM NOW THAT WILL NOT ALLOW US TO GO FORWARD. AND THAT WOULD BE A DISSERVICE TO OUR RESIDENTS IN NOW AND I THINK IT'S IN A THERE'S GREAT POTENTIAL HERE BUT RIGHT NOW I DON'T THINK WE'VE REACHED IT. SO I JUST. I'LL SUPPORTED BY JUST WANNA GIVE YOU COSTS. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE -- SENATOR HILL IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN AND I APPRECIATE THE CONCERN AND IN SOME OF THAT THE REASONS IF I MAY RESPOND TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER TRAVIS THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON FOR THE FOR THE COMMENTS AND I TO HAVE BEEN. THE BENEFICIARY OF A GREAT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE EDUCATION -- THE CHALLENGES OF THE CURRENT BILL AND WHY YOU PROBABLY OF WEIRD NOTICING LOWER NUMBERS IS BECAUSE OF THE SUNSET. THE SUNSET HAS PRE IT CREATED SOME OBSTACLES IN TERMS OF ONE PARTNERING WITH INSTITUTIONS AND BUSINESSES WHO FELT. WHY WOULD WE INVEST IN THIS PROGRAM IF IT'S AREA A OCCUPATIONAL TYPE OF A BACHELOR'S DEGREE AND THEN HAVE IT TERMINATE AND NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES AS WELL AS STUDENTS WHO DIDN'T WANT? TO BEGIN THE PROGRAM AND THEN HAVE AND BEFORE THEY COULD FINISH THE PROGRAM SO THIS GIVES AN OPPORTUNITY AND I THINK WE'LL HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR. FOR HIS HELP IN THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE INFORMATION NECESSARY AT THE END OF THE DAY TO MAKE A GOOD EVALUATION OF THE PROGRAM AND SEE WHETHER AT THAT POINT IN TIME. IS WELL WORTH GOING FORWARD OR NOT SO THANK YOU I'M AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS FRIDAY GOING TO THE MEETINGS OF THE FOOTHILL COLLEGE GRADUATES AT THAT THEIR FESTIVITIES SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE MEMBERS THANK YOU BUT AGAIN THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THE BILL. FOR OUR COMMITTEE SUPPORTED -- LAST YEAR S. B.. SEVEN SIXTY NINE WHICH AND THIS LEGISLATION TAKES AN EVEN MORE RESTRAINED APPROACH. SO I BELIEVE THAT THE ADDITIONAL DATA THAT WILL BE COLLECTED -- EXTENDING THE SUNSET WILL HELP US GET TO A MORE COMPLETE PICTURE. AND TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAM SO. IF ENTERTAIN A MOTION. BUT AT A MOTION BY MISTER LOW HIS ACTION BY [inaudible] MISTER CHAVEZ. MADAM SECRETARY THE WE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. MEDINA AYE AYE MEDINA AYE BAKER ARAMBULA. ARAMBULA I BLOOM CHAVEZ CHAVEZ I IRWIN KILEY LEVINE. LEVINE AYE LOW LOW AYE PATTERSON. PATTERSON AYE QUIRK SILVA SANTIAGO WEBER [inaudible] WEBER I SEVEN ZERO YOUR BILL IS OUT WILL LEAVE IT OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS A COMMITTEE CHAIR THANK YOU CALLING THANK YOU. AND NEXT SIZE SENATOR GLAZER. IF YOU'D LIKE -- TO BEGIN WITH ITEM TO CENTER% WHICH AT WHICH BILL IS THAT WOULD IS S. B. THREE FOUR SIX THREE FOUR SIX GOT IT. IT'S THAT WHEN YOU ARE. READY WHEN YOU ARE ALRIGHT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT THIS BILL THAT CREATES INCENTIVES TO ENCOURAGE PARTICIPATION IN THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE PROGRAM. AS YOU MAY KNOW THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE PROGRAM WHICH WE ESTABLISHED LAST YEAR GET STUDENTS WHO WANT TO GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS. THE TOOLS TO DO SO SO FAR NEARLY EIGHT THOUSAND STUDENTS ARE PARTICIPATING. BUT THE FACT IS THE PROGRAM WON'T BE A TRUE SUCCESS UNLESS WE HAVE EVEN BROADER PARTICIPATION. SO THE BILL IN FRONT OF YOU OFFERS INCENTIVES TO ATTRACT MORE STUDENTS TO THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE. AND ULTIMATELY WILL INCREASE THE FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE. THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. DESERVEDLY THIS BILL WOULD DO THE FOLLOWING THINGS FIRST IT WOULD IT ESTABLISHED THE STUDENT SUCCESS IN ON TIME COMPLETION FUND. I IN THE STATE BUDGET. TWO WOULD ALLOW MONEY TO BE APPROPRIATED TO THIS FUND BY THE LEGISLATURE. TO BE USED FOR SUMMER GRANT. S. YOU'D BE SUMMER TERM GRANTS FOR THAT SUMMER SCHOOL CLASS THAT MAYBE YOU CAN'T AFFORD. THAT CAN KEEP YOU ON TRACK. I TO IT WOULD ALLOW FOR ON TRACK PROGRESS GRANTS CASH AWARDS TO STUDENTS WHO ARE IN NEED. OR THREE A TUITION FREEZE TO QUALIFYING CALIFORNIA PROMISE STUDENTS AT SPECIFIED IN THE BILL. I'M STARTING ON JULY FIRST OF A TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AT THIS BUT THIS PROPOSAL WILL PROVIDE BACK IN TUITION WAIVERS FOR ALL REMAINING CLASSES. THAT IS STUDENT NEEDS TO GRADUATE WHEN THE CAMPUS IS UNABLE TO PROVIDE THAT PATHWAY. TO GRADUATING FOR TWO YEARS. I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND AND YOUR STAFF FOR WORKING WITH ME ON AMENDMENTS TO STRENGTHEN THE BILL. IN PARTICULAR THIS BILL LIMITS THE INCENTIVES TO STUDENTS ARE IN NEED AND THEREFORE CATEGORIES FOR THOSE THAT ARE APPLIED TO THAT DEFINITION -- LOW INCOME UNDERREPRESENTED FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS I OR TRANSFER STUDENTS. I IMPORTANTLY INCENTIVES CREATED BY THIS BILL REQUIRE A BUDGET APPROPRIATION BY THE LEGISLATURE. UNIVERSITY CHOOSE WHICH INCENTIVES TO BE USED THAT INDIVIDUAL CAMPUS PROGRAMS. TO REITERATE THIS BILL SPECIFIES THAT MONEY IN THIS NEW FIND MAY BE USED BY THIS TRUSTEES'. TO CREATE INCENTIVES NOTHING REQUIRES THEM TO DO THIS. I AND THAT THE AUTHORITY WILL CONTINUE TO REST WITH THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES. I'M NOT PLEASED TODAY TO BE JOINED BY MARY DOLAN WHO REPRESENTS THE CALIFORNIA STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION. AND THE FOR HER TESTIMONY TODAY. GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE CHAIR MEDINA AND MEMBERS I AM AS MARY DOLAN I'M THE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS ASSOCIATE FOR THE CALCIUM STUDENT ASSOCIATION. WHICH REPRESENTS THE NEARLY HALF A MILLION CSU STUDENTS. WE ARE THANKFUL TO SENATOR GLAZER FOR THE WORK THAT HE'S DONE ON US BEEF THREE FOR SEX THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE PROGRAM. THREE YEARS AGO WHEN SENATOR GLAZER BROUGHT THE CALIFORNIA PROMISED BUILT OUR PORTS YES IS A OPPOSE THE BILL. AT THE TIME WE FELT LIKE THE TUITION FREEZE INCLUDED AS WELL AS THE IDEA THAT ONLY PRIVILEGED STUDENTS COULD ACCESS THE PROGRAM DID NOT HAVE CERTAIN EQUITY AT THE HEART OF THE PROGRAM. MAKING OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE TO ONLY THOSE STUDENTS WITH THE FINANCIAL ABILITY TO TAKE THEM IS NOT AN EQUITABLE SOLUTION TO US. MANY STUDENTS HAVE TO WORK MULTIPLE JOBS TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES AND MANY TIMES THEIR FAMILIES. FOR THEM THE IDEA OF TAKING FIFTEEN UNITS IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF WELL AND LAZINESS AS THE STUDENTS ARE TYPICALLY WORKING HARDER THAN ANYONE COULD EVEN IMAGINE. AND AS AN ORGANIZATION THAT REPRESENTS YES YOU STUDENTS WITH SUCH A HIGH LEVEL OF POWER RECIPIENTS FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS AND UNDERREPRESENTED POPULATIONS. EQUITY IS AN ABSOLUTE PRIORITY FOR US. IT'S AN ARE VERY MISSION AS AN ORGANIZATION. THAT IS WHY WE ARE SO APPRECIATIVE OF THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE ON S. B. THREE FORTY SIX BY SENATOR GLAZER AND THE STAFF. TO COME UP WITH INCENTIVES TO ENABLE ALL STUDENTS A GOOD FAITH OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE PROGRAMS. WITH THE ADDED INCENTIVES SUMMER TERM GRANTS ON TRACK PROGRESS GRANTS DOT THAT NOT TUITION COSTS AND NO TUITION CHARGE FOR STUDENTS WHO TAKE LONGER THAN FOUR YEARS. YOUR INSTITUTIONAL FAULT THE BILL NOW ADDRESSES MANY OF OUR CONCERNS REGARDING EQUITY. GOING TO COLLEGE HAS A NUMBER OF BENEFITS FOR OUR STUDENTS PARTICULARLY IN THE CAL STATE SYSTEM THESE OPPORTUNITIES FOR UPWARD MUCH SOCIAL MOBILITY IS CHIEF AMONG THEM. THIS PERSPECTIVE IS SUPPORTED BY RESEARCH THAT ARE SHOWN MEDI CAL STATE CAMPUSES ARE THE NATIONAL LEADERS ON ENABLING UPWARD SOCIAL MOBILITY. BUT THIS BENEFIT IS NEVER REALIZED AND STUDENTS ARE ACTUALLY WORSE OFF IF THEY CANNOT GRADUATE. AT THE STATE CREATES PROGRAMS THAT HELP STUDENTS GRADUATE QUICKER EVEN SMALLER SUBSETS OF STUDENTS THAT HAS AN IMPACT ON ALL STUDENTS. SIMPLY PUT. GRADUATING SINCE QUICKER OPENS UP COURSE BASED ACROSS THE BOARD AS WELL AS ENROLLMENT SPOTS. S. B. THREE FOUR SIX SEEKS TO DO JUST THIS NOW WITH THE INCENTIVES INCLUDED NOT ONLY WILL THE BENEFITS OF THE PROGRAM BE SEEN BY ALL STUDENTS IN THE SYSTEM. BUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO PERSONALLY PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM IS OPEN TO ALL STUDENTS. WE THANK THE SENATOR FOR THIS WORK AND HEARD YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION SECOND [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] WE'LL COME. PLEASE COME FORWARD. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OBVIOUSLY SHAUN BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION AYE CFA HAS CONCERNS ABOUT THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT COULD DISPROPORTIONATELY. AND DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS ALREADY CLOSE TO GRADUATING IN FOUR YEARS AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHER STUDENTS AND THEIR NEEDS. WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE GOALS TO IMPROVE DEGREE COMPLETION TIME WE REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT DIVERTING FISCAL RESOURCES FROM THE CSU SYSTEM TO A SUBSET OF THE STUDENT BODY. WHILE WE CONTINUE TO WRESTLE WITH SIGNIFICANT FUNDING SHORTFALLS. SO FOR THESE REASONS WE ASK FOR A NO VOTE THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] ANY TWEENER. ANY QUESTIONS SIR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] SEEING NONE -- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE AT HER LEG AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR YOUR GOOD WORK ON THIS. OUR MANY CONVERSATIONS I WOULD NOTE THAT STUDENTS ARE CLOSE TO GRADUATING AUTOMATICALLY GET THE HIGHEST PRIORITY ON EVERY CAMPUS ITS BASED ON UNITS THAT THEY'VE ACCUMULATED SO. I DON'T SEE ANYBODY REALLY GETTING A DISADVANTAGE OUT OF THIS. I I THINK THAT OUR HOPE WOULD BE AND I KNOW THAT. CHAIRMAN YOU WORK SO HARD ON THIS THIS YEAR TOGETHER -- TO TO RAISE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE'RE GIVING TO OUR SYSTEMS WITH A FOCUS ON STUDENT SUCCESS IT MEANS THAT THESE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS GET FUNDED MAYBE NEXT YEAR. EVEN MORE THAN THEY ARE THIS YEAR AND WE CAN CONTINUE TO HELP KIDS GET THROUGH FASTER. A TO EVERYONE'S BENEFITS WITH THAT THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION APPRECIATE DRIVE OUT. THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER -- THANK YOU AGAIN FOR WORKING WITH MYSELF IN THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU TO THE STUDENT REPRESENTATIVE TO I THINK MAKING THIS A BETTER BILL -- AND AND I COMMEND YOU FOR YOUR PERSISTENCE -- AND AND THANK YOU FOR THE WORK. THAT AYE I WILL POINT OUT THAT THAT ON PAGES SEVEN EIGHT OF THE ANALYSIS THERE ARE STILL SOME ADDITIONAL. COMMENTS THAT I HOPE YOU WILL CONTINUE TO ADDRESS -- BUT IT THIS IS NOW A BILL THAT I CAN SUPPORT. AND WILL BE SUBORDINATE HERE THIS. AFTERNOON WE HAVE A MOTION BY.

ACCORDING TO THE TWO SYSTEMS AND YOU'LL HEAR FROM THEM -- THEY HAVE A COMBINED CAPITAL NEEDS OF SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS. THIRTEEN BILLION FOR SHORT TERM LONG TERM PROJECTS THOSE LIBRARIES.

DOCTOR RUMBLE OF I HAD THE PLEASURE OF TOURING FRESNO STATE WITH OUR PRESIDENT THE EIGHTH PRESIDENT WE'VE HAD PRESIDENT JOE CASTRO. AND WAS AMAZED AT THE LACK OF INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE STATE OF FACILITIES AT ONE OF OUR PREMIER COLLEGES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE MORE MONEY NEEDS TO BE SPENT -- FRESNO STATE ITSELF WAS SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS BEHIND IN NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS TO ITS CENTRAL PLANTAIN COOLING FACILITIES AND BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL IS AN APPROPRIATE VEHICLE AND MEASURE. AND I'M QUITE HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT IN IF THERE'S EVER AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADD A CO AUTHOR I'D LOVE TO BE PART OF THIS IS WHAT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. WEB DOT WEB YES I APPRECIATE THIS AND AND CLEARLY THERE'S A TREMENDOUS NEED YOU YOU SAVE US ABOUT WHAT FIFTEEN MILLION BILLION AND UNMET NEED OR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IS THAT WHAT IT WOULDN'T. DISASTROUS ACCIDENT SHE THE ONE OF YOU ONE OF YOU SAID ALL YES THAT'S CORRECT -- FOR THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA IT'S A FIVE YEAR OVER FIVE REPEAT TIME THAT'S OUR OUR EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR FIGURE. YEAH AND YOUR NAME IS THE SAME THE SAME RIGHT OKAY SO WHAT IS FOR BILLION GOING. TO OF ANTI ISSUE. I MEAN HAVE YOU FIGURED OUT. WHAT FOUR BILLION WOULD WOULD MEAN I MEAN WELL IN TERMS OF? OF IF IF WE'RE LOOKING AT A SIXTY HOLE YEAH AND YOU WANT FOUR SETS 25%. SO SPEAKING FOR THIS CSU WE HAVE A FIVE YEAR CAPITAL OUT OUT LEE PLAN WHERE WE PRIORITIZE DIFFERENT FACILITIES AND PROJECT NEEDS. SO WHAT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WITH WITH THE MONEY IS. THE PROJECTS WILL COME UP BEFORE OUR OUR BOARD -- AND THEN IT WOULD COME UP BEFORE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO. WE WE WE DO HAVE A FIVE YEAR PLAN THAT. TO DEAL WITH FOR FOOD DEAL WITH TWO BILLION DOLLAR RIGHT RIGHTS WE WILL TAKE THAT MONEY ACCORDING TO THE URGENCY OF THE NEED. UNIVERSITY WOULD CALIFORNIA DO SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR AGAIN THE URGENCY OF NEED WOULD BE FACTORED INTO THE PRIORITIZATION THAT THE UNIVERSITY GAVE IT BUT WE HAVE PROJECTS ITERATED CHO AND WHILE WE HAVE -- PROJECTS TO OUTSTRIP THIS FUNDING THIS IS CERTAINLY A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IT'S BEEN AGAIN SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIX THAT WE'VE HAD. A GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND TO WORK WITH. NOW THERE'S ANOTHER BOND -- WITH EGGMAN AND HOWEVER THOSE TWO A LINE THAT I YOU KNOW I I SOMETIMES I BECOME. CONCERNED IF WE GO TO THE PUBLIC TOO OFTEN THAT WE WILL GET WHAT WE REALLY WANT INSIDE NOT SURE WHETHER THERE'S BEEN AN EFFORT. HAVEN'T TALKED RELATED TO COORDINATE BETWEEN THE TWO BECAUSE BOTH OF YOU ASKING FOR SIGNIFICANT DOLLARS HAS I THINK MUCH MORE BUT NONE THE LESS IS THERE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO BONDS OR ARE AS A BEEN CONVERSATION ABOUT.

MY AND THE HORSE YOU THAT THAT WE HAVE A NUMBER THAT THE GOVERNOR'S COMFORTABLE LIFE ADVANCING AND SO. WITH THE PILOT FOR DISCUSSIONS WITH HER AND ALSO WITH THAT WITH THE GOVERNOR DOES HE WHAT HE BECOMES. OUR NEEDS ARE TREMENDOUS AND YOU MAY REMEMBER BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN AROUND AWHILE. THAT I USED TO BE THAT HIGHER EDUCATION FACILITIES REFUNDED FROM THE COFFEE FUND ABOUT THAT YEAH OFFSHORE OIL YEAH RECEIPTS THAT CERTAINLY HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE AYE ANYMORE AND THE GENERAL FUND MONEY -- HAS NOT BEEN THERE EITHER SO AND I KNOW THIS TREMENDOUS NEED ON OUR CAMPUSES. FOR OF JUST GENERAL MAINTENANCE NOT NOT EVEN TALK ABOUT NEW FACILITIES WHICH IS GENERAL MAINTENANCE OF THE FACILITIES THAT WE HAVE -- WHICH ARE ENORMOUS AND REQUIRED SO I I'M SUPPORTIVE I JUST WANT ALWAYS BECOME CONCERNED WE DON'T ASK FOR ENOUGH -- AND PEOPLE GIVE US SOME AND THEN WE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ENOUGH AND THEY PROBABLY WOULD HAVE GIVEN US WHAT WE ASK FOR WE'D ASK FOR IT YOU KNOW IT'S ON THOSE KIND OF THINGS. AND I THINK I HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE IN PUBLIC IN SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT WOULD WIND UP FOR BOND AND AND WE GOT IT BUT WE WASN'T ENOUGH SO WE HAD TO GO BACK INTO ANOTHER ONE IN THIS TIME WE WOULD GET A BIG ONE AND PEOPLE VOTED FOR IT.
