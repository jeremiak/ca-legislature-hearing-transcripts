FRAWLEY WILL BE MORE CLARITY ON.

00:28:13.458 --> 00:28:17.162 region:rollup2
THE USAGE OF BALLOT IMAGES AS

00:28:15.827 --> 00:28:18.330 region:rollup2
WELL AS THE TIMING ISSUE THOSE

00:28:17.162 --> 00:28:19.865 region:rollup2
HARD TO ME TO THE TWO LARGER

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:20.866 region:rollup2

SO WELL ON THIS BILL AND.

00:28:34.913 --> 00:28:38.116 region:rollup2
I CONSIDER THIS BILL A WORK IN

00:28:36.048 --> 00:28:41.086 region:rollup2
PROGRESS.

00:28:38.116 --> 00:28:42.688 region:rollup2
WE VERY MUCH ARTS OF. IN SUPPORT

00:28:41.086 --> 00:28:45.657 region:rollup2
OF A RISK LIMITING AUDIT OF

00:28:42.688 --> 00:28:47.659 region:rollup2
ELECTIONS WE THINK IT'S VERY.

00:28:45.657 --> 00:28:48.727 region:rollup2
VERY MUCH NEEDED.

00:28:47.659 --> 00:28:50.796 region:rollup2
BUT THIS BILL NEEDS A LOT OF

00:28:48.727 --> 00:28:52.331 region:rollup2
WORK YET A I AM ESPECIALLY

00:28:50.796 --> 00:28:54.533 region:rollup2
CONCERNED ABOUT.

00:28:52.331 --> 00:28:56.134 region:rollup2
THE TOTALS THAT ARE USED TO AND

00:28:54.533 --> 00:28:57.302 region:rollup2
THE TIMING OF WHEN A RISK

00:28:56.134 --> 00:28:58.704 region:rollup2
LIMITING ORDER ORDER CAN START

00:28:57.302 --> 00:28:59.671 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

00:28:58.704 --> 00:29:01.139 region:rollup2
A ACCORDING TO TALK TO PHILIP

00:28:59.671 --> 00:29:01.907 region:rollup2
STARK.

00:29:01.139 --> 00:29:03.642 region:rollup2
ALL THE BALLOTS NEED TO BE

00:29:01.907 --> 00:29:05.110 region:rollup2
COUNTED.

00:29:03.642 --> 00:29:06.378 region:rollup2
BUT IN THE REAL WORLD OF THE

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:08.080 region:rollup2
VERY LARGE COUNTIES THEY ARE

00:29:06.378 --> 00:29:09.715 region:rollup2
COUNTING TO THE VERY LAST DAY OF

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:12.084 region:rollup2
THE CAMPUS PERIOD.

00:29:09.715 --> 00:29:13.619 region:rollup2
SO I THINK WE NEED TO COMPROMISE

00:29:12.084 --> 00:29:15.120 region:rollup2
SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN WHERE

00:29:13.619 --> 00:29:16.955 region:rollup2
PRACTICALLY ALL THE BALLOTS ARE

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:19.625 region:rollup2
COUNTED. AND THE ONES THAT ARE

00:29:16.955 --> 00:29:21.793 region:rollup2
NOT YET RESOLVED AND COUNTED.

00:29:19.625 --> 00:29:25.097 region:rollup2
YEAH I CAN BE COUNTED.

00:29:21.793 --> 00:29:25.664 region:rollup2
FOR THE LOSER COUNTED MOST

00:29:25.097 --> 00:29:26.431 region:rollup2
CONSERVATIVELY TO NARROW THE

00:29:25.664 --> 00:29:28.500 region:rollup2
MARGIN.

00:29:26.431 --> 00:29:31.470 region:rollup2
SO THAT.

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:32.771 region:rollup2
OF BUTTON BUT WE CAN'T.

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:34.106 region:rollup2
SAY THAT WE'RE GONNA USE THE

00:29:32.771 --> 00:29:35.641 region:rollup2
TOTALS ON ELECTION NIGHT BECAUSE

00:29:34.106 --> 00:29:36.808 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:29:35.641 --> 00:29:38.777 region:rollup2
EXCLUDES A THIRD OF ALL THE

00:29:36.808 --> 00:29:40.112 region:rollup2
BALLOTS THAT.

00:29:38.777 --> 00:29:42.314 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW AND SERVE THAT WON'T TO

00:29:40.112 --> 00:29:43.815 region:rollup2
SO WE ARE VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT

00:29:42.314 --> 00:29:45.217 region:rollup2
OF RISK LIMITING AUDITS.

00:29:43.815 --> 00:29:46.818 region:rollup2
THIS BILL WE CONSIDER A WORK IN

00:29:45.217 --> 00:29:48.253 region:rollup2
PROGRESS.

00:29:46.818 --> 00:29:49.755 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT SURE WE CAN SUPPORT IT

00:29:48.253 --> 00:29:51.657 region:rollup2
THE WAY IT IS RIGHT NOW WE WOULD

00:29:49.755 --> 00:29:52.958 region:rollup2
RATHER NOT HAVE TO.

00:29:51.657 --> 00:29:54.359 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE WE THINK

00:29:52.958 --> 00:29:55.827 region:rollup2
IT'S MUCH TOO WEAK TO WAITERS

00:29:54.359 --> 00:29:56.995 region:rollup2
THERE IN NEEDS.

00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:08.700 region:rollup2
WOULD MEAN AUDIT IS TO GO BEYOND

00:31:07.132 --> 00:31:11.470 region:rollup2
