01:45:50.043 --> 01:45:51.311

PEOPLE'S WEAPON OF CHOICE IN

01:46:07.194 --> 01:46:08.328
THESE CASES.

01:46:08.395 --> 01:46:09.463
NOW THERE'S A LOT ABOUT FOR

01:46:09.529 --> 01:46:11.665
JUDGES IF IT'S A CAR THAT HAS TO

01:46:11.732 --> 01:46:12.999
BE USED FOR SOMEBODY TO GET TO

01:46:13.066 --> 01:46:14.935
WORK OR IF THE CARS BEING DRIVEN

01:46:15.001 --> 01:46:16.303

01:46:16.369 --> 01:46:17.537

01:46:17.604 --> 01:46:19.272
IT'S A HARDNESS ON THE FAMILY.

01:46:19.339 --> 01:46:20.140
BUT WHEN WHAT I THOUGHT WHEN I

01:46:20.207 --> 01:46:21.108
TALK TO LAW ENFORCEMENT OF MY

01:46:21.174 --> 01:46:22.843

01:46:22.909 --> 01:46:23.977

01:46:26.046 --> 01:46:26.480

01:46:26.546 --> 01:46:28.582

FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME.

01:46:30.183 --> 01:46:31.485
SO I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS AN

01:46:31.551 --> 01:46:32.619
APPROACH THAT WILL WORK.

01:46:32.686 --> 01:46:34.121
AND IT'S ONE THAT'S NEEDED JUST

01:46:34.187 --> 01:46:35.422

DRIVING IS A PRIVILEGE NOT A

01:46:44.698 --> 01:46:45.499
RIGHT.

01:46:45.565 --> 01:46:46.299

01:49:23.924 --> 01:49:26.459
IN FACT HE HAD TESTED POSITIVE

01:49:26.526 --> 01:49:28.862
FOR SIX DIFFERENT CHEMICALS

01:49:28.929 --> 01:49:29.462
FOUND IN THESE WROTE DOWN THE

01:49:29.529 --> 01:49:30.130
SIDES.

01:49:30.196 --> 01:49:31.398
P. FORTY SEVEN HOWEVER IT WAS

01:49:31.464 --> 01:49:33.433
ONE OF ONLY FIFTEEN MOUNTAIN

01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:35.068
LIONS THAT CALL THE SANTA MONICA

01:49:35.135 --> 01:49:36.569
MOUNTAINS HOME.

01:49:36.636 --> 01:49:38.271
BUT WAS OF THOSE FIFTEEN THE

01:49:38.338 --> 01:49:40.173
FOURTH ONE ABOUT SENSITIVE

01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:42.008
POPULATION IT HAS DIED DIRECTLY

01:49:42.075 --> 01:49:43.510
AS A RESULT.

01:49:43.576 --> 01:49:45.211
OF RODENTICIDE POISONING.

01:49:45.278 --> 01:49:46.613
IN FACT TESTING IS SHOWN THAT

01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:48.915
NEARLY EVERY MOUNTAIN LION HAS

01:49:48.982 --> 01:49:51.851
RAT POISON IN THEIR SYSTEM.

01:49:51.918 --> 01:49:52.919
THERE ARE MANY OTHER TOP LEVEL

01:49:52.986 --> 01:49:54.587
PREDATORS AND WILDLIFE THAT HAVE

01:49:54.654 --> 01:49:55.989
BEEN POISONED AND KILLED.

01:49:56.056 --> 01:49:58.191
AND ACROSS THE STATE MANY CASES

01:49:58.258 --> 01:49:59.492
WHERE PETS OF BEEN POISONED

01:49:59.559 --> 01:50:02.162
AFTER INGESTING THESE CHEMICALS.

01:50:02.228 --> 01:50:04.597
ANTICOAGULANT RODENTICIDE THIS

01:50:04.664 --> 01:50:06.399
BECAUSE ANIMALS TO BLEED OUT

01:50:06.466 --> 01:50:08.568
INTERNALLY AND THIS ALSO

01:50:08.635 --> 01:50:10.036
DISRUPTS THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEMS

01:50:10.103 --> 01:50:11.604
NATURAL ABILITY TO FIGHT OFF

01:50:11.671 --> 01:50:14.207
INFECTIONS AND AFFLICTIONS SUCH

01:50:14.274 --> 01:50:16.343
AS MANGE WHICH ULTIMATELY IS THE

01:50:16.409 --> 01:50:18.812
DISEASE THAT TAKES MANY OF THESE

01:50:18.878 --> 01:50:19.546
ANIMALS.

01:50:19.612 --> 01:50:20.580
IN THE THREE MAJOR MOUNTAIN LINE

01:50:20.647 --> 01:50:21.848
STUDIES CURRENTLY BEING

01:50:21.915 --> 01:50:23.516
CONDUCTED IN CALIFORNIA

01:50:23.583 --> 01:50:25.352
RODENTICIDE HAVE APPEARED IN

01:50:25.418 --> 01:50:27.554
EVERY TISSUE SAMPLE TAKEN FROM

01:50:27.620 --> 01:50:30.290
WILD ADULT LIONS AT LEVELS HIGH

01:50:30.357 --> 01:50:31.624
ENOUGH TO BE OF SERIOUS CONCERN.

01:50:31.691 --> 01:50:34.027
ANOTHER STUDY REGARDING THE

01:50:34.094 --> 01:50:35.562
ENDANGERED PACIFIC FISHER HAS

01:50:35.628 --> 01:50:37.364
SHOWN THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS AND

01:50:37.430 --> 01:50:38.865
THREATS THAT RODENTICIDE POSE

01:50:38.932 --> 01:50:40.433
AND IT'S CAN CONTRIBUTION TO

01:50:40.500 --> 01:50:43.136
THAT SPECIES NEAR EXTINCTION.

01:50:43.203 --> 01:50:44.037
THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND

01:50:44.104 --> 01:50:45.638
WILDLIFE HAS BEEN WARNING ABOUT

01:50:45.705 --> 01:50:47.974
THE IMPACTS THAT ROSANNA SITES

01:50:48.041 --> 01:50:49.709
ARE HAVING ON ALL WILDLIFE IN

01:50:49.776 --> 01:50:51.077
THE STATE AND AS A RESULT OF

01:50:51.144 --> 01:50:52.579
THESE WARNINGS.

01:50:52.645 --> 01:50:53.947

NON TARGETED DEATHS BUT THESE

01:51:07.427 --> 01:51:09.195

DAVIS BLOOM DOCTOR QUIRK.

01:51:53.173 --> 01:51:56.242
YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

01:51:56.309 --> 01:51:58.278
THANK YOU SPEAKER IN MEMBERS I

01:51:58.344 --> 01:51:59.846
DON'T OFTEN GET UP ON THE FLOOR

01:51:59.913 --> 01:52:02.482
TO SUPPORT OTHER PEOPLE'S BILLS --

01:52:02.549 --> 01:52:04.717
BUT I'M MAKING AN EXCEPTION HERE

01:52:04.784 --> 01:52:06.419
I MAKE AN EXCEPTION BECAUSE I

01:52:06.486 --> 01:52:07.220
CARE.

01:52:07.287 --> 01:52:09.489
ABOUT OUR ENVIRONMENT THE CARE

01:52:09.556 --> 01:52:11.658
ABOUT THE RAPTORS THE MOUNTAIN

01:52:11.724 --> 01:52:14.861
LIONS THE COYOTES.

01:52:14.928 --> 01:52:16.529
WE HAVE AN ORGANIZATION CALLED

01:52:16.596 --> 01:52:19.866
RAPTORS ARE THE SOLUTION RATS.

01:52:19.933 --> 01:52:21.901
WHICH POINTS OUT THAT BY KILLING

01:52:21.968 --> 01:52:24.370
THE MOUNTAIN LIONS WITH THESE

01:52:24.437 --> 01:52:25.905
RODENTICIDE BY KILLING.

01:52:25.972 --> 01:52:28.508
THE RAPTOR WE ARE LIMITING THE

01:52:28.575 --> 01:52:30.243
WAYS WE CONTROL THE ROADS IN THE

01:52:30.310 --> 01:52:32.312
WILD.

01:52:32.378 --> 01:52:34.147
THIS IS TRULY SOMETHING THAT

01:52:34.214 --> 01:52:35.949
OUGHT TO HIT THE HEART SPRINGS

01:52:36.015 --> 01:52:38.384
HEART STRINGS OF EVERYONE HERE.

01:52:38.451 --> 01:52:39.886
AND I'M HOPING IT DOES BECAUSE

01:52:39.953 --> 01:52:42.489
WE HAVE GOOD SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE

01:52:42.555 --> 01:52:43.890
STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT

01:52:43.957 --> 01:52:45.825
EVIDENCE THAT THIS IS HARMING

01:52:45.892 --> 01:52:47.393
OUR WILDLIFE.

01:52:47.460 --> 01:52:51.998
AND IT HAS TO STOP NOW THANK YOU.

01:52:52.065 --> 01:52:54.701
THANK YOU THAT QUIRK.

01:52:54.767 --> 01:52:55.301
THIS FRIEDMAN YOUR RECOGNIZED

01:52:55.368 --> 01:52:55.935
THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE

01:52:56.002 --> 01:52:58.838
TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB.

01:52:58.905 --> 01:52:59.706
SEVENTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT JUST

01:52:59.772 --> 01:53:02.342
YESTERDAY THE U. N. REPORTED

01:53:02.408 --> 01:53:03.009
THAT.

01:53:03.076 --> 01:53:05.512
APPROXIMATELY A MILLION SPECIES

01:53:05.578 --> 01:53:07.380
ON THE EARTH ARE ON THE VERGE OF

01:53:07.447 --> 01:53:08.515
EXTINCTION DUE TO YOU.

01:53:08.581 --> 01:53:10.717
THE ACTIVITY OF HUMAN BEINGS.

01:53:10.783 --> 01:53:13.653
I LIVE IN THE HILLS IN GLENDALE.

01:53:13.720 --> 01:53:15.955
AND WHEN I SEE COYOTES IN MY

01:53:16.022 --> 01:53:17.724
NEIGHBORHOOD IT'S VERY VERY

01:53:17.790 --> 01:53:18.858
COMMON.

01:53:18.925 --> 01:53:21.528
THAT THEY ARE CLEARLY SUFFERING

01:53:21.594 --> 01:53:23.730
FROM THE EFFECTS OF ANTI

01:53:23.796 --> 01:53:25.265
COAGULANT RODENTICIDE.

01:53:25.331 --> 01:53:27.400
ANIMALS SPOTTED AROUND THE AREA

01:53:27.467 --> 01:53:29.102
WITH MANGE.

01:53:29.169 --> 01:53:31.304
THIN.

01:53:31.371 --> 01:53:32.872
SUFFERING WEEK.

01:53:32.939 --> 01:53:35.608
WE SEE DEAD HAWKS AND OWLS IN

01:53:35.675 --> 01:53:37.443
THE COMMUNITY.

01:53:37.510 --> 01:53:39.946
I REPRESENT GRIFFITH PARK.

01:53:40.013 --> 01:53:42.649
MOUNTAIN LIONS DYING.

01:53:42.715 --> 01:53:44.584
BECAUSE OF RODENTICIDE HAS

01:53:44.651 --> 01:53:48.154
BECOME A HUGE AREA OF CONCERN.

01:53:48.221 --> 01:53:49.856
FROM THE PUBLIC THE PUBLIC WHO

01:53:49.923 --> 01:53:52.058
DOESN'T WANT TO SEE OUR WILDLIFE

01:53:52.125 --> 01:53:54.594
BEING POP POISON NEEDLESSLY.

01:53:54.661 --> 01:53:55.328
I HEARD A VERY INTERESTING

01:53:55.395 --> 01:53:57.096
REPORT FROM I BELIEVE IT WAS

01:53:57.163 --> 01:53:59.232
FROM THE CITY OF OXNARD OR

01:53:59.299 --> 01:54:00.233
SOMEWHERE IN VENTURA WHERE THEY

01:54:00.300 --> 01:54:01.901
HAD DONE A STUDY.

01:54:01.968 --> 01:54:03.069
WHERE THEY TOOK AN AREA THAT WAS

01:54:03.136 --> 01:54:05.405
A SENSITIVE AREA BECAUSE OF RATS

01:54:05.471 --> 01:54:07.106
AND THEY TOOK TO PARTS AND THEY

01:54:07.173 --> 01:54:07.740
WERE VERY CAREFUL TO MAKE SURE

01:54:07.807 --> 01:54:08.942
THAT THEY WERE YOU KNOW

01:54:09.008 --> 01:54:10.610
BASICALLY IDENTICAL AREAS?

01:54:10.677 --> 01:54:11.844
AND ONE AREA THEY USE THE

01:54:11.911 --> 01:54:14.781
RODENTICIDE AND ANOTHER AREA

01:54:14.847 --> 01:54:17.317
THEY USED RAPTORS JUST BY

01:54:17.383 --> 01:54:18.618
PUTTING A RAPTURE HOUSE UP IN A

01:54:18.685 --> 01:54:19.619
RAFTER MOVED IN.

01:54:19.686 --> 01:54:21.588
AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS AND THEY

01:54:21.654 --> 01:54:23.223
WERE DONE ASIDE AREA.

01:54:23.289 --> 01:54:25.525
THE RATS ACTUALLY THE POPULATION

01:54:25.592 --> 01:54:27.160
OF RIGHTS ACTUALLY INCREASED

01:54:27.227 --> 01:54:30.096
BECAUSE WHEN THE RATS DID EAT

01:54:30.163 --> 01:54:31.431
THE ROAD UNDECIDED POISON THE

01:54:31.497 --> 01:54:33.900
RAPTORS AND THE RAPTORS DIED.

01:54:33.967 --> 01:54:35.268
THE AREA THAT DIDN'T HAVE THE

01:54:35.335 --> 01:54:36.903
CHEMICALS THAT WAS USING ONLY

01:54:36.970 --> 01:54:38.805
THE RAPTORS SAW A DRAMATIC

01:54:38.871 --> 01:54:41.674
DECREASE IN THE RAP POPULATION.

01:54:41.741 --> 01:54:43.443
SO NOT ONLY IS THIS CHEMICAL

01:54:43.509 --> 01:54:45.945
CRUEL AND CAUSING HAVOC AMONGST

01:54:46.012 --> 01:54:47.480
THE WILDLIFE THAT WE WANT TO

01:54:47.547 --> 01:54:49.382
PRESERVE.

01:54:49.449 --> 01:54:51.884
BUT IT'S COUNTERPRODUCTIVE NO I

01:54:51.951 --> 01:54:53.586
HAVE SEEN THE BILL THE BILL HAS.

01:54:53.653 --> 01:54:55.655
SPECIFIC EXEMPTIONS FOR MEDICAL

01:54:55.722 --> 01:54:57.790
EMERGING -- FOR FOR EMERGENCIES

01:54:57.857 --> 01:54:59.492
ABOUT COMMUNICABLE DISEASES AND

01:54:59.559 --> 01:55:01.494
IN CERTAIN PLACES IT'S A VERY

01:55:01.561 --> 01:55:03.396
BALANCED APPROACH.

01:55:03.463 --> 01:55:04.831
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW IMPORTANT

01:55:04.897 --> 01:55:07.233
THIS IS FOR MY COMMUNITY.

01:55:07.300 --> 01:55:09.302
I HAVE GOTTEN A LOT OF EMAILS OF

01:55:09.369 --> 01:55:11.204
SUPPORT FROM CONSTITUENTS I HOPE

01:55:11.271 --> 01:55:11.838
THAT YOU HAVE AS WELL IN YOUR

01:55:11.904 --> 01:55:12.905
COMMUNITIES.

01:55:12.972 --> 01:55:14.540
AND I HOPE THAT ALL OF YOU WILL

01:55:14.607 --> 01:55:16.576
JOIN ME AND DOCTOR QUIRK OF

01:55:16.643 --> 01:55:18.011
COURSE WERE MISSED -- THE MEMBER

01:55:18.077 --> 01:55:19.612
FROM SANTA MONICA IN VOTING FOR

01:55:19.679 --> 01:55:20.680
THIS MEASURE AND I REALLY

01:55:20.747 --> 01:55:23.750
APPRECIATE HIS LONG TIME WORK ON

01:55:23.816 --> 01:55:26.886
THIS ISSUE THANK YOU MEMBERS.

01:55:26.953 --> 01:55:27.787
THERE WAS FRIEDMAN MISTER

01:55:27.854 --> 01:55:29.389
GALLAGHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

01:55:29.455 --> 01:55:30.423
THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS

01:55:30.490 --> 01:55:31.824
THAT WE HAD THIS BILL AND THE

01:55:31.891 --> 01:55:32.825
WATER PARKS AND WILDLIFE

01:55:32.892 --> 01:55:34.394
COMMITTEE AND I THINK THE BOTTOM

01:55:34.460 --> 01:55:35.762
LINE IS ALTHOUGH I THINK THE

01:55:35.828 --> 01:55:37.563
INTENT BEHIND THIS BILL IS A

01:55:37.630 --> 01:55:39.866
GOOD -- ONE AND I AND I

01:55:39.932 --> 01:55:43.303
UNDERSTAND THE GENTLEMAN FROM --

01:55:43.369 --> 01:55:43.936
WEST HOLLYWOOD WHAT HE'S TRYING

01:55:44.003 --> 01:55:45.772
TO DO -- BUT IT IS TOO OVER

01:55:45.838 --> 01:55:48.308
BROAD AND AS WE HEARD FROM MANY

01:55:48.374 --> 01:55:50.943
PEOPLE IN THIS FIELD -- IF IF

01:55:51.010 --> 01:55:53.079
YOU TOTALLY BAN THIS PRODUCT.

01:55:53.146 --> 01:55:54.514
WE ARE GOING TO LOSE A VERY

01:55:54.580 --> 01:55:55.882
VITAL TOOL IN GETTING THAT

01:55:55.948 --> 01:55:57.550
RODENTS WHICH DO YOU KERRY

01:55:57.617 --> 01:55:59.319
COMMUNICABLE DISEASES.

01:55:59.385 --> 01:56:01.120
WHICH WILL HAVE IMPACTS IN OUR

01:56:01.187 --> 01:56:04.624
IN OUR URBAN AND OUR RURAL AREAS --

01:56:04.691 --> 01:56:06.926
RAPTORS ARE GREAT BUT THEY CAN'T

AMAZING EXPERIENCE WITH A

THAT A TEACHER CAN MAKE.

02:32:07.184 --> 02:32:08.786

MUCH TO OUR WORK.

02:32:16.126 --> 02:32:18.863
BUT YET IN THE CURRENT CONTEXT I

02:32:18.929 --> 02:32:20.264
THINK WE NEED TO DO MORE.

02:32:20.331 --> 02:32:21.999
SO THIS RECOGNITION SERVES AS

02:32:22.066 --> 02:32:23.100
THE START.

02:32:23.167 --> 02:32:24.768

02:32:35.579 --> 02:32:36.981
HOWEVER THE CURRENT CONTEXT FOR

02:32:37.047 --> 02:32:39.383
TEACHERS REMAINS A CHALLENGING.

02:32:39.450 --> 02:32:41.785
