AS WE ALL KNOW THE REVISED BUDGET THAT WE WILL BE REVIEWING OVER THE NEXT VERY FEW WEEKS IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN THE BUDGET THAT THE GOVERNOR PRESENTED TO US IN JANUARY. DUE TO THE GLOBAL RECESSION THAT IS A DIRECT RESULT. OF THE CALL THE NINETEEN PUBLIC HEALTH PANDEMICS. WE FIND OURSELVES FACING A SIGNIFICANT BUDGET SHORTFALL AT THE TIME THAT THERE IS AN INCREASED NEED TO DEPLOY RESOURCES AND TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. AS SUCH. WE WILL USE THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE LAST RECESSION AND AVOID MAKING BUDGET DECISIONS THAT EXACERBATE THE PROBLEMS THAT WE ARE ALL FACING. BOB IT'S HELPFUL THAT THE THAT TAKES THE BALANCED APPROACH IN A MANNER THAT FOCUSES ON PROTECTING OUR CURRENT LEVEL OF PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. AARON DO ACTIONS THAT WE ALL HAVE TAKEN OVER THE LAST DECADE WE ARE IN A MUCH BETTER POSITION THAT WE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST. A BUDGET SHORTFALL SUCH AS THIS. HOWEVER IN ORDER TO STAY ON THE FISCAL IMPACT OF THE GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH PANDEMICS. WE MUST HAVE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR BOTH OUR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AS WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE PUSH FOR ADDITIONAL FEDERAL SUPPORT IN THE COMING WEEKS WE WILL BE WORKING UNDER A CONDENSED TIMELINE. BEGINNING WEDNESDAY AND THROUGH THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND. EACH BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE WILL HOLD ONE HEARING TO REVIEW THE MAJOR PROPOSALS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE AREA. SUBCOMMITTEE FIVE WILL MEET ON WEDNESDAY SUBCOMMITTEE FOUR WILL MEET ON THURSDAY SUBCOMMITTEE THREE WILL MEET ON SATURDAY SUBCOMMITTEE TO WILL MEET SUNDAY AND SOMEONE WILL MEET ON MONDAY.

AND THE LA- AND ARE SENATE BUDGET TEAM IN ALL THE WORK THEY WILL DO TO GET US DOCUMENTS WE NEED TO MAKE THE BEST DECISION ON BEHALF. OF CALIFORNIA.

MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WE APPRECIATE THE CHANCE TO BE HERE. I'LL KEEP MY OPENING COMMENTS THREE TO RESERVE THE BALANCE OF THE TIMES FOR A MEMBER QUESTIONS. THE NAY REVISION THAT THE GOVERNOR RELEASED A LAST THURSDAY MAY FOURTEENTH IT'S A BALANCED BUDGET INCLUDES ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN. BILLION DOLLARS. EXPERTS IN THAT. THE JUDICIAL USE RESERVE. AND IT INCLUDES ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS EXPENDITURES. WE KNOW THAT THIS IS A DIFFICULT SITUATION AS DISCUSSED IN THE WEEK BEFORE THE REASON A REVISION. THE STATE'S CASE IS A FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET PROBLEM WHEN YOU INCLUDE THE CURRENT YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY THAT WERE IN USE AND THE BUDGET YEAR TWENTY TWENTY DASH TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WHEN WE LOOK AT A REVENUES ALONE ALL THREE MAJOR SOURCE OF REVENUE FOR THE GENERAL FUND PERSONAL INCOME TAX SALES AND USE TAX AND CORPORATE TAX ARE DOWN MORE THAN 20% TO WHERE WE PROJECTED THAT THEY WOULD BE IN JANUARY FOR THE COMING YEAR. OUR CASE LOAD EXPENSES I'M SORRY YOUR CASE LEADING ROLE MAKING MEDI CAL WORKS ARE PROJECTED TO BE OUT. ON AND THEN WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE ARE DIRECTLY. ASKING MONEY TO. THE NINETEEN AND YOUR- YOUR- ATTACK PUBLIC TELLS SO WHEN COMES TO SOLVE THIS SIXTY FOUR GOING DOLLARS BECAUSE WE ARE TO CON PROPOSED A BALANCED. THE GOVERNOR'S NAY REVISION INDEXES. FIRST AMONG THESE IS GOING BACK TO THE EXTENSIONS THAT WERE COMPOSED IN THE JANUARY BUDGET AND THE GOVERNOR AND THE ADMINISTRATION I HAD WORKED WITH MANY OF YOU ON THESE PROGRAMS YOU KNOW INCREASES FOR YOU SEE AND HEAR YOU THANKS CAL. AROUND ONE ACTS. OTHERS THAT WERE EXCITED ABOUT TO CITED. GIVEN BUDGET THESE ALSO IN A SHIFT. FUNDS FOR CAN WERE. FOR SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS HEY CALPERS OBLIGATE OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS. THE SECOND CATEGORY OF SOLUTIONS RELATES TO THE USE OF RESEARCH THE ADMINISTRATION ARE WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND HIGHER ADMINISTRATION AND LEGISLATURE'S HAVE WORKS GENERALLY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS TO BUILD A- IT WAS A SIX HOUR NOTICE RAINY DAY FUNDS. AND WITH LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP. AND SO THAT WE COME INTO THIS YEAR WITH SIXTEEN GOING TWO BILLION IN A RAINY DAY FUND ANOTHER NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE STATE. RESTORE OUSTED YOUR MENTIONED WE ARE A TRAINED THIS RECESSION IN A MATTER FISCAL POSITION WE GET A LAST. SO BUDGET REFLECTS THE JUDICIOUS USE OF. ARE BOTH IN THE COMING YEAR BUT ALSO IN THE YEARS AFTER THAT BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S HIGHLY LIKELY THAT RECOVERY. THE WE WILL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO HOW TO BEGIN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WILL LIKELY STRETCH ON BEYOND YEAR. ANOTHER CATEGORY OUTCOMES WITH FARMING FROM SPECIAL FINDS MY CHANGES RELATED TO TRANSFER AND DEFERRALS OF SOME SPENDING. BROWN'S BUDGET IN THE COMING YEAR. WE ALSO INCLUDING TEMPORARY INCREASING REVENUES AWAITS THE USE THAT OPERATING LOSSES CREDITS ON AS WELL AS BUSINESS. OF CREDITS AND PUTTING A CAP ON THOSE. TWENTY TWENTY THREE HELP THE STATE. NEXT SPRING YOURS. I THINK HERE MENTIONED FEDERAL FUNDING IS CRITICAL BOTH IN TERMS OF BALANCING THIS BUDGET. AS WELL AS A LONGER TERM FISCAL POSITION OF THE STATE SO BUDGET INCLUDES ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR IT ASKED NOT INCREASE FROM CONGRESS. AS WELL AS AUSTIN'S PROVIDED THROUGH THE CORONA VIRUS RELEASED TIMES ON THIS IS THE FIFTEEN POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS. BUT STATE LOCAL. WHICH ABOUT NINE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS TO THE STATE. AND WE PROPOSE AN ALLOCATION FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION IN THE. NAME OF MISSION. FINAL AND GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE BUDGET PROBLEM WE FACE THIS DOES INCLUDE A SIGNATURE NUMBER BASED. THESE ARE CUT TO BE. WHAT WAS IN THE BUDGET. LAST YEAR AND THIS INCLUDES IGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN SPENDING ON. K. TWELVE EDUCATION HIGHER EDUCATION HEALTH HUMAN SERVICES PORTS. IF YOU AREAS OKAY NOT RECEIVE SOME TYPE OF REDUCTION IN THE NEIGHBORING NATION. BUILDING THESE FUNDS WITH THE TRIGGER SO THAT IF THE CONGRESS COMES THROUGH AND THE PRESIDENT SIGNS ADDITIONAL RELEASED FOR THE STATE OF THE LEAST FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS APPROXIMATELY. THOSE CUTS WILL TRIGGER AUSTIN THEY WILL BE RESTORED TO THEIR PRIOR LEVEL MORE THAN MY TWO YEAR AND I'M HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT CONTROL SECTION LANGUAGE THAT WE ARE CLOSED ON OR ANY OTHER CONSIDERATIONS I STEP AWAY. THIS IT'S ALL BEING SAID WE PROPOSED TO FOR THE YEAR ACCORDING TO A MULTI YEAR FOR WHICH LOOKS THREE YEARS AFTER THAT WE ARE STRUCTURAL RIGHT NOW IN THOSE YEARS GROW OVER TIME SO WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE% CONTINUED BUDGET ISSUES TO ADDRESS AND WE ARE HOPING THAT THE ADDITIONAL USE OUR CORRELATES PROVIDED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S NOT ONLY HELPED TRIGGER ALL KINDS BUT ALSO HELD THE ADMINISTRATION AND LEGISLATURE NAVIGATE THROUGH THESE NEXT COUPLE YEARS HE CALMLY. I WILL MENTION MONEY KNOW THAT CALM SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR PROBLEMS. THERE IS ON WHAT WE CAN REDUCE OR WHAT WE CAN TRANSFER OR WHAT WE CAN BORROW AS THE CASE MAY BE. BUT I DO ALSO WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT OKAY SOMEWHAT THIS. PRIORITIZE AND IN PARTICULAR I WANT TO FOCUS ON THE ELEMENTS PUBLIC CHANNELS AND SAFETY WHEN IT COMES NOT ONLY TO. THE RESPONSE TO COME IN NINETEEN THE- EMERGENCY THAT IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF US IN TERMS OF. CONTAINING THIS KIND AN X. BUT ALSO FUNDING. FOR OTHER EMERGENCY CAPABILITIES INCLUDING INCREASED RESOURCES CAL FIRE YES. EVEN AS WE CAN CHANGE THIS KIND AN ACHE WE KNOW THAT WILL BE ENTERING ANOTHER WILDFIRE SEASON. THERE ARE OTHER NATIONAL OR OTHER DISASTERS ACTION IS LIKE THE STATE AND SO THIS IS A CORE RESPONSIBILITY STATE GOVERNMENT. AND WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS. THAT WE MAKING THOSE. CAN FINALLY WENT TO WHAT WE CRIER. MENTION THE IMPORTANCE DURING OUR ASSIST TO MAKE SURE THAT THE OF THAT IS NOT DISPROPORTIONATELY ON THE MOST INCOME POPULATIONS STATE WHICH- HEALTH IS ALREADY GEARING AND ONE MAY. REASON WHY IN THIS CASE ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED NOT MAKING ANY CHANGES TO MEDICARE ELIGIBILITY KEEPING CAL WORKS CRANKS AFTER CURRENT LEVELS AND MAINTAINING THE CURRENT- COMBINED GRANT LEVELS FOR SSI. WE HOPE THAT MAINTAINING THESE INVESTMENTS INCLUDING AS WELL MAINTAINING THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT FOR THE STATE THAT THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR'S MORE THAN DOUBLED LAST YEAR WILL HELP PEOPLE. GET THROUGH THIS TRYING TIME. WHEN THE BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES SEVERAL MEASURES WHEN IT RELATES TO ECONOMIC RECOVERY INCLUDING ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE FOR SMALL BUSINESS WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR. HAS SET UP A TASK FORCE THAT SOMEONE JUST WAITERS ARE ON AS WELL AS PEOPLE IN STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS SECTORS OF THE STATE AND WE HOPE THAT THE TASK FORCE THE ADMINISTRATION WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU ACTUALLY. I NEED NOT. WELL PUBLIC HEALTH. WE KNOW THAT THIS IS A BIG WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO WORK WITH THE LIKES. NOW TO GET YOU WHERE YOU WERE AND WE APPRECIATE THE CHANCE TO PARTICIPATE I'VE GOT SEVERAL OF MY COLLEAGUES ON THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND ON THE SO WE WERE BY REMOTE YEAH AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SERVICE WHEN OFTEN WILL MOVE COLLEAGUES TO HEAR THE PRESENTATION FROM THE LA- UPON COMPLETION OF HIS PRESENTATION. ALL OF IT UP FOR QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. MR PANIC. GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON- MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU FOR INVITING NEED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE HEARING TODAY AND THANK YOU TO. THE VICE CHAIR AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND LOOK FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSION AND- I HAVE A HAND OUT HERE THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO WALK THROUGH. AND WHO WE ARE AND YOU HAVE A COPY AND HOPEFULLY YOU CAN VIEW IT. SO LET ME BEGIN WITH. READ RECAPS RESTATING SOMEWHAT THE- OVERVIEWS AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PROVIDED I THINK IN MANY WAYS WE HAVE- SOME SIMILARITIES WITH HOW WE USE THE PROPOSAL AND- YEAH WE CATEGORIZE SOME THINGSA LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY AND ALSO WE THINK THERE'S AN IMPORTANT CHOICES FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE IN THE COMING WEEKS SO WE JUST GO BACK TO- JANUARY BRIEFLY IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHERE WE WERE AT THAT TIME THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED BUDGET WITH A- PROJECTED SURPLUS OF ALMOST SIX BILLION DOLLARS. AND THE OUTLOOK WAS MUCH BRIGHTER AT THAT POINT. BUT THEN AS WE KNOW WE WERE STRUCK BY THIS- GLOBAL PANDEMIC THAT THROUGH THE STATE AND THE NATION AND THE GLOBE REALLY INTO A SEVERE. ECONOMIC RECESSION THAT THAT NOT ONLY WAS SEVERE BUT TOOK TOOK EFFECT ON VERY QUICKLY. AND AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THAT- THIS STATE REVENUES. THE OUTLOOK FOR STATE REVENUES DETERIORATED SUBSTANTIALLY. AND RT AS AS- AS WAS ALREADY MENTIONED THE REVENUE PROJECTIONS FOR THE CURRENT YEAR IN THE BUDGET YEAR WERE REDUCED BY FORTY ONE BILLION COMPARED TO THE JANUARY ESTIMATE AND AT THE SAME TIME THERE IS A CORD EXPENSE PRESSURE ON EXPENDITURES. UPWARD EXPENDITURE CRUSHER WAS IN TWO MAIN AREAS BOTH ON THE DIRECT COULD BE RELATED RESPONSE ACTIVITIES BUT THEN ALSO AS A RESULT OF THE DECLINING ECONOMIC SITUATION. IN THE NEED FOR MORE PEOPLE TO. ENROLL IN OUR SAFETY NET PROGRAMS THERE IS A HIGHER COST THE CASELOADS IN OUR IN OUR SAFETY NET PROGRAMS INADEQUATE. UPWARD PRESSURE ON ACROSS ALL OF THIS- IN TAKEN TOGETHER- RESULTED AND DIG THE GOVERNOR'S ESTIMATE OF A FIFTY FOUR POINT THREE BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET PROBLEM FOR THE FOR THE CURRENT AND NEXT YEAR. AND WHAT I HAVE ON THE SLIDE BEFORE YOU ON THE FIRST LINE IS IN A SUMMARY OF THE MAIN REVISION GENERAL FUND XIN ANIME REVISION. WHAT YOU SEE THERE IS AS WAS STATED HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN POINT FOUR BILLION IN REVENUES AND TRANSFERS IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT IT WAS IN JANUARY WAS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE POINTS. SO THAT'S A NINE POINT 4% DECLINE AND THIS FIGURE INCLUDES. SIGNIFICANT TRANSFERS IN AND SOME REVENUE AUGMENTATION. THE EXTENDED. I AM HERE SHOWS A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE POINT NINE BILLION AND IN JANUARY THAT WAS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE POINT WHAT SO THAT IS THE THAT IS A pCHOICES THAT DOES THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES TO MAKE IN THIS YOUR VISION. IN ADDITION IF YOU THAT BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT BALANCE IT GOES FROM SIXTEEN POINT TWO BILLION DOWN EIGHT POINT FOUR BILLION. YEAH AND YOU KNOW THEN IT THIS IS A ANOTHER BIG CHANGE BECAUSE IN JANUARY WAS PROJECTED THAT THE STATE WOULD END TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE WITH AN EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT BALANCE. SIMILARLY THE SAFETY NET RESERVE. GOES FROM NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOWN TO FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION. SO THAT IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE AFTER THE GOVERNOR AND DEVELOPED HIS PROPOSED WAYS TO CLOSE TO FIFTY FOUR POINT THREE BILLION DOLLAR ARE PROJECTED BUDGET PROBLEM. MOVING TO THE NEXT SLIDE. I WOULD LIKE ON THIS SLIDE TO WORK KIND OF FROM LEFT TO RIGHT IF YOU LOOK ON THE LEFT SIDE THERE THE RED BAR WELL YOU SEE REALLY IS THE BUDGET PROBLEM THE FIFTY FOUR POINT THREE BILLION. AND THE WORK RIGHT THESE ORANGE SMALLER BARS ARE THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM EACH OF THESE PROPOSED AREAS OF THAT WILL REDUCE THE BUDGET PROBLEM. SO SOME OF THESE ARE IN SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT CATEGORIES IN OUR OFFICES VIEW ALL. YOU HAVE. DESCRIBED IT SO MANY JUST BRIEFLY TELL YOU HOW WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THIS. ON THE FIRST ONE THE BASELINE ADJUSTMENTS YES. OF COURSE TEN OF THE TOTAL COULD YOU SOLUTIONS I DIDN'T. THINGS LIKE THE INCREASED MATCH FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR THE STATE'S MEDI CAL PROGRAM BUT IN IN HOME SUPPORT SERVICES AND- DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICE AREA. IT ALSO REFLECTS AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE BASELINE BY TAKING OUT WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAD PROPOSED IN IN JANUARY AND- WHEN YOU REMOVE THOSE THAT'S WHAT MAKES AT THESE BASELINE ADJUSTMENTS. IN ADDITION WE HAVE AS WAS MENTIONED TO. THE USE OF BUDGET RESERVES IN THIS CASE THEY REPRESENT ABOUT 15% OF THE TOTAL SOLUTION PACKAGE AND SEVEN POINT EIGHT BILLION ABOUT IS FROM THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT AND THE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION FROM THE STATE YOU KNOW RESEARCH. AND ENSURE THAT THERE IS SOME NEW AUGMENTATION AND THAT ACCOUNTS FOR AROUND 8% OF THE SOLUTION AND IT IS NOT SO MUCH A BROAD BASED TAX PRIEST BUT- FOR US EXPLORATIONS REVENUES THAT WOULD COME IN PARTICULARLY IN THE CORPORATION. SO MEETING AT SIX OUR EXEMPTION BUT SOME BUSINESSES FOR AND THAT WOULD RAISE ABOUTFOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL THEN I THE NEXT ITEM IS THE LARGEST REDUCTION SHOWN ON THIS WHICH IS ADJUSTING THE K. FOURTEEN PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING LEVEL DOWN TO THE MINIMUM GUARANTEED ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT. OF THE TOP BUDGET LUCIEN'S ALTHOUGH IT IS OFFSET TO SOME DEGREE BY SOME OTHER A JOB INSTEAD A MENTION IN A MOMENT. ARE WE HAVE BEEN REDUCTIONS THAT ACCOUNT 41819% OF THE SOLUTIONS. AND THESE ARE. IN IN KIND OF TWO BROAD CATEGORIES SOME ARE SOMEWHAT FLATTERS FLORIDA CROSS THE BORDER NATURE SIR. FOR EXAMPLE 10% REDUCTIONS TO THE HIGHER EDUCATION- UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS THE JUDICIAL BRANCH AND- EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION BUT THEN. AGAIN PERSON MORE TARGETED REDUCTIONS ALSO. THANK THINGS LIKE. YEAH AND SHE'LL INFRASTRUCTURE GRANTS FOR EXAMPLE AND THESE THESE SOLUTIONS IN TOTAL. PRESENTED ABOUT 18% OF. ALL THE SOLUTIONS. THEN IN THE NEXT CATEGORY WE HAVE WHAT ARE CALLED A CONSCIOUS AND THESE ARE. BUDGET OF FISCAL TOOLS THE LEGISLATURE HAS AT ITS DISPOSAL ON THESE INCLUDE THINGS LIKE- SPECIAL FUND LOANS TO THE GENERAL FUND SO YOU'RE REALLY SHIFTING SOME COSTS TO OTHER FUNDS OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT BASED ON A TEMPORARY BASIS. BUT THEY ALSO INVOLVES. OUR STUDENTS TIME SO. THAT WOULD BE THE EXAMPLE MENTIONED ABOUT THE CHANGING THEIR PLANS FOR THE NEXT FOR SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT. RATHER THAN MAKING A SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT WITH PAY DOWN THE LONG TERM LIABILITY IT WOULD ACCELERATE- TAKE TAKE THAT THE SAME FINDS AND PUT IT TOWARD THE CURRENT AND NEXT YEAR. CONTRIBUTION GO THE LONG TERM BENEFITS OF MAKING THOSE SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PAYMENTS TO THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY. AND THEN IN THE LAST CATEGORY OF OUR FEDERAL FUNDS BOAST AN APOLOGIZE THE CAUTIOUS OR ABOUT THE CATEGORY ARE FEDERAL FUNDS WHICH MAKE UP ABOUT 7% OF THE- SOLUTION. THE INCLUDED. YOU KNOW THINGS THE- AT THE FEDERAL CARES ACT FUNDING WHICH INCLUDED THE- OPEN RELIEF FUND GAINED ABOUT THAT THAT THE STATE WILL RECEIVE ABOUT NINE POINT FIVE BILLION OF THAT YEAH AND ALLOCATED TO. PROGRAMS LIKE HELL WORKS AND HOMELESSNESS AND PUBLIC SAFETY AND PUBLIC HEALTH AND THOSE ARE WILL TOTAL ABOUT THREE POINT EIGHT BILLION FROM IN THOSE AREAS. AND THIS. IS SORT OF A- THE SAME INFORMATION. PRESENTED AND SOMEWHAT A TABLE FORMAT WITH MORE DETAILS ON WILL PASS OVER THAT ONE. AND ON THE SCHOOL REDUCTIONS I MENTIONED THAT THIS REPRESENTED THE LARGEST ITEM ON OUR BORDER CHURCH BUT THERE'S SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT IS NOT IS ALTHOUGH WE ARE REDUCE ENGINE AT. OPPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING LEVEL TO THE MINIMUM CARE AND SHE- WE ARE OFFSETTING THAT AT LEAST IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND THE- BUDGET YEAR BY PROVIDING THE SCHOOLS WITH. US FIVE POINT EIGHT BILLION OF FEDERAL FUNDS THESE FUNDS ARE WOOD IN THE MAJORITY OF THESE FUNDS WOULD GO TO- MITIGATE AGAINST OUR LEARNING LAS THAT HAS LIKE WE ARE HERDERS OCCURRING BECAUSE OF. THE YOU KNOW SITUATION OUR STUDENTS ARE IN THE CLASSROOM. AND THEN ANOTHER FIVE POINT THREE BILLION OF DEFERRALS SO THESE TWO ITEMS TOGETHER HELP. BRING BACK THE SUBSTANTIAL IF NOT ALL OF THIS FUNDING TO THE SCHOOLS IN THESE TWO YEARS. IN ADDITION THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES SETTING UP A NEW LONG TERM OBLIGATION FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO THEIR SCHOOL RULES. THAT WOULD. THE MINIMUM GUARANTEED FUNDING LEVEL ON A SOMEWHAT HOT AT A SOMEWHAT HIGHER PLATEAU GOING FORWARD ESSENTIALLY RAISING IT FROM ABOUT 38% 240% OF GENERAL FUND REVENUES. AND AT THE AT THE MINIMUM. AND SO. THAT WOULD DRIVE BEGIN TO BE PAID TO THE SCHOOLS AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. NEXT I WOULD LIKE TO JUST TOUCH ON THE CODED RELATED FINDING. HERE THE MAIN MESSAGE THAT I WOULD HAVE- FOR THE LEGISLATURE IN THIS AREA IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE THIS POINT IS NOT HAVE A VERY DETAILED WERE CLEAR PICTURE OF WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN IS. AT THIS POINT THERE ARE STILL SOME MECHANISMS IN PLACE THAT WOULD. PROVIDE FOR FUNDING- DISCRETION OVER HOW TO SPEND FUNDING TO THE ADMINISTRATION AND WE THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT SOME OF THESE IDEAS BECAUSE- SOME OF THE SOME OF THE PROCESSES THAT WERE PUT IN PLACE SUCH AS THE SECTION THIRTY SIX- CONTROL SECTION THIRTY SIX PROCESS WERE PUT IN PLACE JUST PRIOR TO BUT WHEN I JUST LAY YOU'RE GOING ON TO ONE SOCIAL DISTANCE. REQUIRE BUT NOW THAT IT'S NOT. QUITE THE SAME WAY WE THINK THAT MAYBE IT'S TIME TO REVISIT SOME OF THOSE. AND WE HAVE SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER ON THE SPOT. NOW HOW DO WE LOOK AT THE PROPOSAL OVERALL. WELL IN GENERAL WE THINK THAT THE MIX OF SOLUTIONS IS GENERALLY WELL BALANCED- IN THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE RECOMMENDED IN OUR SPRING OUTLOOK FROM JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE THINK IS A VERY IMPORTANT AND IN THE BEST OF THE WEB DEVELOPMENT FOR THE LEGISLATURE. SIR IN ORDER IS BOTH ON THE FISCAL SIDE AND THE PUBLIC DECIDE AND SO ON ALTHOUGH THE GENERAL MIX OF SOLUTION SEEMS REASONABLE THE LARGEST DIFFERENT PREFERENCES FOR. HOW THEY ARE WAITED RULE THIS IS SIMPLE. COMPONENTS OF THE PROPOSED SOLUTIONS ARE. SECONDLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE PROPOSED REVENUE SOLUTIONS. WE THINK THAT THE IDEA OR- SO SPENDING THAT OPERATION NOT OPERATING LOSSES AND LIMITING TAX CREDITS FOR THE CORPORATION TAX OR A REASONABLE REASONABLE PLACE TO START AND THEY ARE LESS BURDENSOME THAN A BROAD BASED TAX RATE INCREASE. LET'S KEEP IN MIND THE DIRECT WITH THEIR PRIMARILY REPRESENT REVENUE ACCELERATION YOU'RE NOT AN ONGOING SOURCE OF READING. THEY'RE ALSO VERY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT BECAUSE OF CORPORATION TAXES JUST THE TORIES FOR BEING DIFFICULT TO PREDICT FIRST CALLS. AND WE THINK OF IT THERE'S SOME RISK TO RELYING ON THIS- AZAR'S SO COMPONENT TO THE SOLUTIONS AND WE SEE THAT THERE IS POSSIBLY. AN ARGUMENT THAT SOME OF THE ESTIMATES IN THE NAY REVISION ARE SOMEWHAT HIGH THEY SAID THOSE ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT FOUR POINT FOR DOING THIS SINCE. IN THE LAST I HAD ONE WOULD SOMETHING NINE WAS IS THAT. OF THE- SPENDING REGARD SO OF THEM ARE. BUT OTHERS ARE A LITTLE BIT ONE JUROR IN THERE STRUCTURE AND SO WE THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER IN SOME CASES MAKING HORSE- STRICT. SURGICAL TYPES OF REDUCTIONS. IN IN SOME AREAS. LOOKING AHEAD TO THE MULTI YEAR BUDGET CONDITION. THE GOVERNOR DOES MAKE PROGRESS IN ADDRESSING- THE YOUNG GOING DEFICIT BUT AS I'M AS WAS MENTIONED THAT. THE MULTI YEARS STILL SHOWS IN YOUR BUDGET PROBLEM FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST RISING WHICH GOES YOUR TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. IT CREATES THIS NEW SIGNIFICANT ONGOING OBLIGATION FOR THE SCHOOLS. AND ONE THING ABOUT THAT IS THAT IN GENERAL OVER TIME THE ENROLLMENTS ARE DECLINING STATEWIDE. AND EVEN BEFORE ADDING THIS NEW OBLIGATION TO THE SCHOOLS WHICH WOULD TOTAL ABOUT THIRTEEN BILLION ONCE IT'S FULLY IMPLEMENTED. THE SCHOOL FUNDING WAS GOING TO INCREASE UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION'S REVENUE FORECAST SUCH THEN EACH YEAR OUR PEOPLE FUNDING WOULD INCREASE BY ABOUT 5% WE JUST THINK THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT THIS BECAUSE- AT A TIME WHEN OTHER PARTS OF THE BUDGET WILL BE NECESSARILY SQUEEZED IN ORDER TO. BRING THE STATE'S FINANCES BACK INTO ALIGNMENT IT WOULD YOU KNOW BE SOMETHING THAT- YOU'D WANT TO BE QUITE CONSCIOUS ABOUT MAKING THIS CHOICE. WE ALSO TAKE WE ALSO HAVE SOME QUESTION WITH REGARD TO THE PENSION PROPOSALS. WOULD SHIFT COSTS TO THE FUTURE YEARS AS I SAID THERE'S ALSO A PROPOSAL TO SPEND THE- ZERO POINT 5% AND STATUTORY FORMULA TO INCREASE TO THE CAL STIRS. FUNDING CONTRIBUTION FROM THE STATE TO THE- ALISTAIR SYSTEM AND WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THAT SAID SOMEONE OF A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT. AND WELL WE THINK THAT IT DOES MAKE SENSE AND IS WARRANTED TO CONTINUE TO SEEK FEDERAL ASSISTANCE. AS THE CHAIR MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SESSION. WE WERE JUST POINT OUT THAT AID IF IT DID COME THROUGH TWO WERE SIMILAR TO THE- FEDERAL ASSISTANCE THE CAME WITH THE AMERICAN REINVESTMENT IN RECOVERY ACT IN TWO THOUSAND NINE. THAT AGES GENERALLY ALMOST CERTAINLY GOING TO BE VERY LIMITED SO IT WOULD BE IN PLACE FOR ONE OR TWO YEARS PROBABLY. AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE SOLUTIONS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PUTTING FORWARD THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE TRIGGERS THERE ALMOST ALL ONGOING PROGRAMS AND SO. ESSENTIALLY WE WOULD GET THIS TEMPORARY FUNDING AND THE ONGOING FINDING WOULD BE TRIGGERED BACK ON. AND THEN YOU THE LEGISLATURE WOULD BE FACED WITH A STRUCTURAL BUDGET ISSUE IN THE SUBSEQUENT YEARS WHEN THE FEDERAL AID WE'RE TO PHASE OUT SOONER JUST ONE OTHER CONSIDERATION. LAST MEAL JUST BY SAYING. THE GOVERNOR MAINTAINS IN HIS NAY REVISION AND SOME PROPOSALS THERE'RE ALL TOGETHER NEW OR REORGANIZATIONS OF CERTAIN DEPARTMENTS LIKE THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT OR THE DEPARTMENT OF BETTER JOBS HIGHER WAGES AND WE THINK IF YOU TO CONSIDER THAT THE RECENT PAST THERE ARE TWO MONTHS OR SO WHERE THE LEGISLATURE REALLY HASN'T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE FULL INSURANCE IN THE WAY THAT IT WITH TRADITIONAL. YOU HAVE CENTER THESE FOR CONCERT. WE THINK YOU MAY WANT TO CAN JUST. SOME OF THESE. ISSUES TO LATER AT POLICY PROCESS OR PERHAPS EVEN THE NEXT BUDGET CYCLE AND THEN FINALLY IN SOME OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS FOR NEW SPENDING ON OPENING WAITED ACTIVITIES. HE IS PROPOSING THAT WE- IN THE COUNTRY CAPTION PROCESS THEN IN THERE- SUFFERS FROM SOME SHORTCOMINGS IN OUR VIEW IN PARTICULAR THAT THE LEGISLATURE DOESN'T HAVE AN ESPECIALLY LONG TIME TO REVIEW. THESE THESE PROPOSED SPENDING ACTIVITIES AND ALSO YEAH IN SOME CASES IT GIVES THE ADMINISTRATION ARE FAIRLY BROAD LATITUDE TO MAKE CHANGES IN HOW THE FUNDS ARE SPENT WE REALLY THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE SURE TO LOOK OUT FOR ITS OWN- THE STORY AND YEAH IT'S PRODIGIES IN THIS. SO WITH HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS AS WELL- WHEN THE TIME IS APPROPRIATE. MR PECK THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUT COLLEAGUES- WE'RE NOW GOING TO TRANSITION TO MEMBER QUESTIONS AND I'M GOING TO JUMP START AS- WELL BUT I AM LOOKING FOR HANDS TO BE RAISED- I SO FAR HAVE SENATORS ROCK AND KNEELS. HAN MINING WHY CAL SKI DURACELL WITH THE- UHHUH. HAVE A YEAR THANK YOU. THE AND SENATOR MORLOCK. THE. SENATOR STERN I SAW YOUR REYES TAN AND SENT TO SKINNER I HAVE YOU AS WELL SO THAT WHEN WE GET STARTED COLLEAGUES- I APPRECIATE BOTH OF YOU. MISTER THIS WILL NOT THAN IN THE PADDOCK- RAISING THE ISSUE OF THE CONTROL SECTION- YOU ALL ARE WELL AWARE THAT- THE LEGISLATURE TOOK ACTION ON THE DAY WE RECESS IN THE FORM OF SB EIGHTY NINE. THAT EXTENDED BOB BROUGHT A STORY TO THE ADMINISTRATION TO SPEND A BILLION DOLLARS. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT WHILE WE WERE RECESSES MY UNDERSTANDING THAT. HUNDRED NINETY FIVE MILLION OF THE ONE BILLION REMAINS AVAILABLE FOR URGENT SPENDING ME. BUT THE REAL QUESTION FOR ME- COMES. IT IS ON YOUR ONGOING REQUEST FOR THE IMPROPER THIRTY FOUR IN ADDITIONAL TWO POINT EIGHT BILLION. AND IT'S GOT TO. WHY IS IT MINISTRATION BELIEVE THEY NEED TO HAVE THE THIRTY TO. THIS SHOULD WITHOUT VISION OF LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL PARTICULARLY SINCE WE ARE NOW BACK IN SESSION. THE SERVICE WHEN OFTEN. YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I THINK WHEN IT COMES SAID TODAY TWO POINT NINE BILLION CONTINGENCY RESERVE I KNOW YOU MENTIONED THE FIRST POINT I WANT TO MAKE A SOUND YOU KNOW WE NOTICES ARMING WRIST WAS ALL. WOULD YOU WANT WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF IN TERMS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS THE APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE AND WE HAD IN OUR CORPORATE GOAL ALL. NOT EVER SINCE THAT WE ARE. WE DO THINK THAT IT IS IN IN CASE PLEASE WHETHER IT'S AN ABSURD. IN NINETEEN AGAIN OR I NEED TO STAY UP COSTS CAPACITY CAPACITY THERE IS A SECOND OR SOME OTHER TYPE OF RELATED EMERGENCY RELATED TO THE NEXT WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE THAT THERE IS. NO QUICKLY AS NOBODY REALLY. THIS A ONE IN A SENSE. MARGINS AND NOBODY REALLY KNOWS HOW IT'S GOING TO HOURS ON EACH OF THE OVERALL ESTIMATE IS TO POINT NINE GOING. BUT WE ESTIMATING CONSISTENT WITH OUR OTHER. BECAUSE IN NINETEEN APPROPRIATE I APPROPRIATE EIGHT. THAT WE HAVE OUTSIDE OF THIS THE MAJORITY OF BATTLE BE REIMBURSE. SO TO SUM IT UP THE REASON HAVE IT IN IS. WE SHOULD CHANGED BUT WE DO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF CONSUL COLLABORATE. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORK WITH YOU TO GET INTO. APRIL THAT LET ME JUST US ALL THE IF THAT WE AGREE TO END THE UP AND SECTION THIRTY SIX WAS A REQUEST TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE WHAT THEY SEVENTY TWO HOURS AROUND. VERSES THE TYPICAL SECTION TWENTY EIGHT CONTROL SECTION THAT ALLOWS FOR THIRTY DAY TURN AROUND AND SELL IT FROM YOUR YOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION FEELS. THAT EVEN WITH THE LEGISLATURE BACK IN SESSION BUT YOU STILL NEED BROADER AUTHORITY WITH SEVENTY TWO HOUR NOTICE IN TERMS OF. YOUR ABILITY TO STAND ALL THREE TIMES NOW DO WE- APPROVED MARCH SIXTEENTH. WOULD YOU WANT TO RESERVE THAT HAS A CONTAINS- JUST BECAUSE WE DON'T NOW HOW THE EMERGENCY IS GOING TO GO AND WE DO WANT TO BE COMPARED YES. HERE IS HOW THE ADMINISTRATION DETERMINED THAT SHE WOULD NEED AN ADDITIONAL TWO POINT NINE BILLION. YES SO ON THIS- I HAVE Y COLLEAGUE TO RESET CALVERT ON THE WIND SO I'LL JUST SAY THAT WE HAVE BEEN CONSISTENTLY REVISING OUR EXPENDITURES WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE PROVIDED ACTS YOU AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. A COUPLE WEEKS AGO AND INITIAL ASSN SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS AND THAT WAS THE GROWTH. IN THE NAY REVISION WE ARE PUTTING OT AND NOW AND NOW ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS ON THE DAY WE ALSO IN ADDITION TO THE ESTIMATES THAT WE HAVE AT THIS POINT IN TIME ONE BUILDING INCIDENTS IN CASE CONDITIONS CHANGE. OVERALL ACCENT FURNITURE TERESA CALVERT PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL. I IN AND JUST TO PROVIDE A BIT MORE FOR ME ON THE TYPE OF ACTIVE THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THAT ESTIMATE SOMEWHERE TO HAVE LAID OUT AB AGENTS IN OUR SUMMARY PAGES IT A PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. CRITICAL MEDIC. DIGITAL HOSPITAL SEARCH FOR AND THERE'S ALSO THE FOR HOW WORKERS SPORTS ACTIVE ON FOR THERE'S THE STATE MORAL AS WELL AS STATE RESPONSE OPERATIONS AND OTHER SUPPORT SERVICES. OR IS THAT WE'RE LOOKING. BUT AGAIN MUCH IS TO BE DETERMINED AND- OR STILL WORKING DIRECTLY ONES. I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO KNOW THAT IT'S THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT THAT WE APPROVED IN MARCH- AND YOU'RE NOT SPENT AT THIS POINT THE FULL BILLION ANOTHER QUESTION WITH REGARD TO THE CONTROL SECTIONS- YOU ALSO INCLUDE TO CONTROL SECTION ELEVEN POINT NINE ELEVEN POINT NINE FIVE. RELATED TO FEDERAL AID THAT WE RECEIVE INTO COMBAT- CALLED NINETEEN HOW THE USE OF THE FUNDS PURSUANT TO THESE CONTROL SECTIONS BE DETERMINED AND FROM YOUR FIRST WHAT WILL THE LEGISLATURE PLAYING IN MAKING THAT DETERMINATION. YES WHEN IT COMES TO THE EAST CONTROL SECTIONS THESE RELATE TO THAT FEDERAL AID AS YOU MENTIONED. INCLUDING SOME OF THE ALLEGATIONS THAT AND THE STATE- UNDER THE MAYOR NATION IT'S IT IS AN ACTIVE THAT IF THESE PROVISIONS ARE NOT. LEGISLATURE WOULD NEED TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AS WELL. THE PROVISIONS OF THE CORONA REQUIRES SOMEBODY FIND ARE RELATIVELY STRICT. STRICTER THAN MANY. OF US LOOK LIKE AND- BOLD AND CONGRESS MIGHT MAKE SOME CHANGES THERE. BUT THE OVER FLAW HERE IS THAT WE TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY SENDING WHETHER IT HAPPENS AT THE STATE LEVEL OR AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. IS ALIGNED WITH THE GUIDANCE. OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO THAT THEY ARE NOT PULLING BACK THE MONEY AFTER THIS ACT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS EMERGENCY ANY PARTICULAR. I TO PROVISIONS ARE NUMBER ONE- ON THE MONEY TO BE USED FOR SPECIFIED PURPOSES AND NOT NECESSARILY SALES BUDGET CAPS ON AND THEN. NUMBER TWO. IN MY CASE. NUMBER THE END OF THE COUCH YEAR RATHER THAN JUST YEAR WE ALL OF US ABOUT THIS AND LOCAL LEVELS ARE YOU TO. I'M SO THAT'S THE OVERALL GONNA TRY OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE. OKAY WE ARE THINKING ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE ACTUALLY WORK THROUGH THE COMING MONTHS IT AGAIN I THINK FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IS NOT MERELY COMMUNICATION IT'S FULL ENGAGEMENT AND PARTICIPATION YES WELL HERE FROM YOUR STAFF MEMBER. SINCE OFTEN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND AS MY COLLEAGUE POINTED OUT AND THERE HAS BEEN TREMENDOUS AMOUNT. OF UNCERTAINTY AND- FLEXIBILITY THAT HAS REALLY BEEN NEEDED AS WE TRACK AND MANAGE THE FEDERAL FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE. AND WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT THE STATE FULLY SPENDS BE FEDERAL RESOURCES CONSISTENT WITH THE FLEXIBILITY PROVIDED. TWO KILLER EARLY AS WE THINK ABOUT THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY AREA. BUT WE WANT TO REMAIN NIMBLE AS GUIDANCE HAS EVOLVED OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS AND WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO MOVE ALL OVER THE COMING WEEKS AND MONTHS. I BELIEVE THAT WE FULLY APPRECIATE THE NEED FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO BE NIMBLE AND BE A POWER TO RESPOND IN A TIMELY MANNER FOR THE CRISIS WHICH IS WHY THE LEGISLATURE PASSED. I'LL GIVE YOU THAT BROAD AUTHORITY MARCH SIXTEENTH BUT I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT. THE ADMINISTRATION FIND A WAY TO BALANCE YOUR ABILITY TO RESPOND TIMELY WITH A GOOD KNOWLEDGE IN THE ROLE OF THE LEGISLATURE MUST PLAY TO PARTNER WITH YOU. TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT ARE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF ALL CALIFORNIANS I HOPE WE CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AND COME UP WITH. SOMETHING THAT MEETS THENEEDS. OF BOTH. BOB VERY QUICKLY JUST LAST TWO QUESTIONS FOR ME AND THEN I WILL PART TO SENATOR ROBB. IT'S BEEN DONE IN THE PAST TO HELP MITIGATE BUDGET SHORTFALL DOES NOT KNOW YOUR MAY REVISE INCLUDES NUMEROUS SPECIAL LOAN SPECIAL FUND LOANS WILL ANY OF THESE LONG IMPACT THE ABILITY OF THE SPECIAL FUNDS TO SUPPORT THEIR CORE MISSION. MR THIS WILL HAPPEN YES. YES SO. THE ANSWER TO THAT IS THAT THE WAY WITHOUT RESTRUCTURED- IN ONE THREE WE MADE SURE THAT WE TOOK INTO CONSIDERATION BEFORE. TAKING ANY SPECIAL FUN RUN ON THE PROGRAM THAT SIGNED IN MIND ESSENTIAL FARMS ON THE NEED FOR CASH. IN MAKING SURE THAT ANYONE CAN DO NAY WITHOUT CAUSING HARM TO THOSE PROGRAMS HEY CERTAINLY THE PLAN A COMING INTO THIS FOR STASHING HOLD SPECIAL FUNDS LOANS FROM HIGHER RECESSIONS IN YOUR MENTIONED I'M SURE THAT. THIS TACTIC HAS BEEN USED BEFORE WHAT THE PLAN IS CERTAINLY TO PAY THOSE LOANS BACK. WAYNE HI THERE THE PROGRAM NEEDS TO MONEY BACK OR WAY AND THE GENERAL SIGNS NO LONGER MEET SOMEONE IN THIS COURSE AND THESE MONIES TO BELONG TO THE SPECIAL FUNDS FOR THEIR PROGRAMS SO WE DEFINITELY. HAD IN MIND IN TERMS OF DECIDING WHAT LEVEL OF LOANS. INTERNAL BORROWING REVIEWS AND ALTERNATE OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE GREG FOR US THAT WAS ON THE PHONE. WHO MIGHT BE ABLE. TO PROVIDE AND SOME ADDITIONAL. I NEED. YEAH THIS IS GREG BREASTS WITH TO OF FINANCE THE FOLLOWING THE FOR ALL OF VALUE WAITED A AND ONLY- AMOUNT THAT WERE IN EXCESS OF WHAT THE DEPARTMENT NEEDED- FOR THE SHORT TERM OR BORROWED FROM AND SO THERE'S THERE WILL NOT BE ANY HARM TO THE PROGRAM'S WINDOWS TO NEED MONEY BACK AT THE POINT WILL BE RETURNED TO THEM. AND THAT'S NO DIFFERENT THAN- THE- RE PAYMENT IF YOU WILL PROCESS THAT WE'VE USED OUT IN PAST YEARS WHEN WE BOUGHT OUR BROKEN SPECIAL LOANS. SAME CROSS THAT SAME TIME FRAME. CORRECT IT'LL LOGIN TO PASS THE EITHER WOULD HAVE A SPECIFIC REPAYMENT DATE OR THEY'RE A LITTLE MORE FLEXIBLE OR THEY JUST SAID WHERE THE COMMENDED APARTMENT NEED THE AT THE PINE SO PENDING HOW THE CERTAIN LOANS WERE WERE PHRASE I'M CERTAINLY WE DO NOT ONE OF OUR MANY TO PROGRAM YOUR PREVENT- THEM FOR LATER MISSION SO. PEOPLE CAN THAT TAB ON A THAT ARE. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PLAN YOU'RE A GOOD SHE- THANK YOU MISTER THIS ONE OFF WITH REGARD TO THE TRIGGER CUTS THAT YOU'VE- IN THE BUDGET AGAIN IF NO ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS- WOULD BE WITH. THEIR MADE AVAILABLE- IN YOUR MAY REVISE YOU'VE MADE THEM EFFECTIVE JULY ONE WHY WAS THE DECISION MADE TO START REDUCTIONS ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE NEW FISCAL YEAR AND- WHY COULD WE INCLUDE A LATER TRIGGER DATE TO ALLOW MORE TIME. FOR FEDERAL ACTION. YES WHEN IT COMES TO ATTACK QUESTION AND SO ARE THINKING ABOUT THIS WAS THAT- THE BUDGET THAT WE ARE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW WITH THE NEIGHBOR VISION AND DENTAL LEGISLATURE'S EVALUATING NOW HOUSE. DOES NEED TO BE BALANCED AND SO. WHILE WE ARE COPING AND CROSSING. FOR ADDITIONAL FEDERAL ACTION. WE WILL MAKE SURE. TO PROPOSE A CONSOLATION LEGISLATION THE ADMINISTRATION WILL NOT A BALANCED BUDGET IS NOW IN INDIA BANKS THAT FEDERAL ACTION DOES NOT TAKE PLACE BEFORE JULY FIRST SO YOU ARE CORRECT THAT THOSE CUTS WOULD BE IN THE PROJECT AT THAT TIME. HOWEVER IT IS THE CASE ON AND MY COLLEAGUE KRISTIN HOW NAY WHY BREAK IT'S ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS. IF AT ANY TIME DURING. THE YEAR. UP NEXT YEAR TWENTY FOUR ONE. I DON'T KNOW. HAS STATED TO ACT. AND THERE IS A FOURTEEN DOLLAR. PLEASE IN ADDITIONAL FEDERAL. TO US COMES THE STATE. UNDER THE CONTROL SECTION THAT WE HAVE FOR CAR. THAT WOULD BE RESTORE OR THOSE TALKS YOUR CORRECT THE COST GOING TO AFFECT UNTIL I. IT'S TIME AFTER FOR THE FEDERAL. YOU GET A ACT TOGETHER AND THEN THE PROGRAM THAT ARE. THAT ON WILL BE. TO THEIR. BUT CHALLENGE WITH THAT IS BECAUSE HAD FOR IN THE LAST KNOW THE ADDITIONAL RE. THAT OVER TO STARTED THAT WE ENDED IS YOU KNOW TOP AN. AND CRAZY MAKING TO PUT IT MILDLY SO AGAIN WHY NOT SIMPLY DELAY A MONTH TO MONTH THREE MONTHS BEYOND JULY ONE JUST TO GET THAT EXTRA TIME WE KNOW THAT. THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TOOK ACTION ON SATURDAY THAT WOULD BENEFIT CALIFORNIA WE NEED TO WAIT FOR THE SENATE. AND SO AGAINST JULY ONE VERSUS. ABSA SIXTY OR NINETY DAY DELAY. YES WE UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS POSSIBLE AND THEY'LL TAKE FURTHER ACTION IN THE SUMMER AND WE'RE CERTAINLY HOPEFUL ABOUT MAX ON BUT WE DO THINK YOU KNOW THE FIRST SEVERAL FACES ARE CORONAVIRUS RELEASED THE PASSED OVER AT THE RESORT. AND MARCH. ALSO ON AND AT THIS POINT IT'S REALLY HARD TO EVALUATE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT AND WHILE WE CERTAINLY HOPE. IT'S ALWAYS LOS THAT IT IS A OF WORKERS. WE DO AND SURE TO EXPECTATIONS IN THIS PROJECT IN PARTICULAR. AS I ALSO MENTIONED WE ARE FACING A STRUCTURAL ONGOING BUDGET PROBLEMS SO EVEN IF. THESE CUTS ARE RESTORED AND WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO DO SOME WORK TO DO IN THE YEARS TO COME. THAT WE ARE. FOR A BALANCED BUDGET WITHOUT THAT HEALTH BUT WE WILL TAKE YOUR FEEDBACK BACK TO MY COLLEAGUES IN THE ADMINISTRATION. AND THE GOVERNOR. SHE KATE AND AS YOU DO THAT WITH I CALL ON SO ROBB I WOULD JUST GO BACK TO THE SECTION AND HOPE THAT YOU WOULD TAKE UP MY COMMENTS- BACK AS WELL WE ARE BACK IN SESSION WE- FULLY INTEND TO FOLLOW THE STATE CONSTITUTION TO HAVE A BALANCED BUDGET VOTED ON AND IN ROUTE TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK BY JUNE FIFTEENTH THAT'S LESS THAN THIRTY DAYS OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE THIS PROCESS IN THAT THIRTY DAY PERIOD CERTAINLY WILL BACK TO OUR BUILDING TO RESPOND. QUICKLY YOU NEED A PARTNER. IN A- FULL AGAIN PLEASE NOTE OUR- CONCERN AROUND EXPANDING. YOUR SKULL WITH ADDITIONAL CONTROL LANGUAGE PARTICULARLY WHEN WE'RE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BUDGET SEASON AND CYCLE. AND SO WITH THAT- WILL BEGIN WITH SENATOR ROBB YOUR QUESTION SIR. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I DO HAVE TWO OR THREE QUESTIONS I WILL RESTRICT THEM TO. THE SUBJECT OF- EDUCATION I WILL TRY TO KEEP THEM AT A HIGH LEVEL AND SAVE THE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS FOR. THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING THAT WE WILL HAVE A WEEK FROM TODAY. SO WITH RESPECT TO MY FIRST QUESTION ONE OF THE MAY REVISION OBVIOUSLY PROVIDES A SUBSTANTIAL DECREASE. IN PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING FOR K. THROUGH FOURTEEN THE REVISION ITSELF ALSO. CONTAINS A VARIETY OF PROPOSALS TO INCREASE NON PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDS. IN THE CURRENT BUDGET YEAR AND IN THE OUT YEARS- FINANCE WITH THESE ADDITIONAL FUNDS OVERALL HOW TO RESOURCES ALLOCATED. TO THE K. THROUGH FOURTEEN EDUCATION SYSTEM COMPARE WITH THE LEVEL THAT WAS PROVIDED FOR IN JANUARY. YES THANK YOU SENATOR ROSS ON THE QUESTION OF K. TWELVE EDUCATION AND PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT RESOURCES. THE FIRST IS THAT- WHEN WE WERE LOOKING AT THE BUDGET GAP WE WERE LOOKING AT THEIR LEVEL OF RESOURCES UNDER PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT COMPARED TO WHAT WE ESTIMATED IN JANUARY OF THIS. OF COURSE IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR WE SEEM TO BE AT A HIGH WATER MARK YOU KNOW WHEN YOU RECESSES ALWAYS YOUNG RISING BUT IT WAS AN- INSIDE TRACK TIMES. FOR THE COMING YEAR WE WERE PROJECTING FOR BILLION DOLLARS- AND THEN IN HERE THAT WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW WE ARE PROJECTING. OVER EIGHTY ONE. IT'S A BECAUSE NINETY EIGHT REVENUES FOR. BY REVENUES. JUST ESTIMATORS ON THE PROMISES NINETY LEVEL ACTS DROPS BACK IN THE CURRENT YEAR I'M IN ADDITION TO THE- I BELIEVE IN THE- HOUSE CHECK MY- YES IS NOT SEVEN SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IT'S NOT WHAT WE ARE EX. YOUR DESTINATION RIGHT NOW AND THEN AS YU NOTED SENATOR ROTH THE BUDGET YEAR TO NINETY EIGHT LEVEL DROPS TO ABOUT SEVENTY DOLLARS SO MASSIVE PROXIMATE. SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR GAPS. AS YOU NOTED A RESTORED THE UP COMING YEAR ON THERE ARE A COUPLE OF STEPS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS TAKING TO FILL THAT OUT AND BUY EXTRA RESOURCE. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT AND FROM OF SIZE IS ADDITIONAL FEDERAL. SO ON THE NIGHT POINTS BILLION. THAT WAS OUR- FOR SOMEONE FLEXIBLE SAY UNDER THE CROWN OR RIDER CORONAVIRUS SO WE SIGNED. UP THAT NINE POINT FIVE FOR BILLION DOLLARS SIXTEEN OUR QUICK ALLOCATED TO SCHOOLS I TO ADDRESS MORNING WE'LL AND EQUITY ISSUES LAST FOUR BILLION DOLLARS RIGHT THERE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THAT WORK FLEXIBLE CORONA VIRUS RELEASED. OX CONGRESS ALSO PROVIDED AN ADDITIONAL APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO SCHOOLS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THEN ONE OTHER CHOICE THAT WE KNOW IS THAT YOU MAY REMEMBER FROM THE BUDGET ACT LAST YEAR. THE STATE HAD PUT IN AN. ADDITIONAL DOLLARS ON THE SCHOOL THIS FOR A CALPERS AND SHALL SERVE. PENSION CONTRIBUTION TO BUY THAT RATE OVER THE TERM. THE GIVEN THE CRISIS THAT WE ARE ALL IN RIGHT NOW AND THE SCHOOL CRISIS AT SCHOOLS IN PARTICULAR FACING WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA USE THAT TWO POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS TO PROVIDE FURTHER IMMEDIATE RELEASE. OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS SO THAT'S A LITTLE OVER A BILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET YEAR. AS WELL AS THE YEAR AFTER THAT. ALL THAT THERE. CASE YOU PRETTY. BACK TO THE REVISED PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT LEVEL. FOR THE CURRENT YEAR NOW ON THIS THIS IS NOT. A SPACE AFTER LEVEL EIGHTY ONE BILLION OR EIGHTY FOUR BILLION WE WERE HOPING FOR THE COMING YEAR- COURSE WE KNOW THAT. YOU KNOW EVERY PART OF THE BUDGET IS TAKING A COT AND SCHOOLS. WE DO HOPE TAX THE SITUATIONAL RESOURCES WILL HELP SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND SCHOOLS MAKE IT FOR NEXT YEAR. AND WE ALSO OVER THE LONG. I. FUND REVENUES A SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT. THAT'S CORRECT GETTING IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET YEAR. YES THIS IS NOT WILL NOT SUPPLEMENTARY PAYMENT WILL BEGIN IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO YEAR RIGHT. SO WITH THE ADDITION OF THAT SUB MODEL- PAYMENT WHAT'S YOUR PROJECTION IN TERMS OF THE OVERALL FUNDING FOR K. THROUGH FOURTEEN. YEAH SO WHEN IT COMES TO THE OVERALL FUNDING IS THAT ONE ONE HALF PERCENT WILL BE IN THE BUDGET YEAR SORT OF ALL INCLUDE THOSE OTHER COMPONENTS THAT WE WERE DISCUSSING. BUT NOT NOT THAT ONE POINT 5% THAT THE WAY THAT THE NAY REVISION INVASION THAT TIME SO IT'LL HE'S ONE POINT FIVE PER. A YEAR THE YEAR ANY ON AND WE'RE- ESTIMATING RIGHT NOW THAT OVER THE- YEAR. WHICH IS THREE YEAR. AFTER THE BUDGET YEAR THIS WILL RESULT IN AND- TEN GOING DOLLARS IN FUNDING FOR. OVER TIME AND I CAN OTHER. CLOSING ACT TO INCREASE THEIR INTENTION OPPOSITION EIGHT ONE GENERAL FROM CURRENT OR 30% TO FORTY PER AND YOU KNOW WE UNDERSTAND THAT NO WAY OUT HAS SOME CONCERNS THAT DEFINITELY WANT TO WORK WITH AND THE CLASS YOU THAT CAN WORK WITH ALL OF YOU I'M WE DO BELIEVE GIVEN PRESSURES SCHOOLS UNDER IN PARTICULAR. THAT IS SOMETHING I STASHED AND THE CROP IS NINETY BASS IMPORTANT PRIORITIES. NOW WITH THE TO THIS WOMAN PAYMENT SINCE IT IS A AGAINST THE CHEN FUND. IF THIS SECOND RECOVERY THAT HOPE WE HAVE. IS SLOW OR SLOW DO YOU ENTER ANY DIFFICULTY WITH THE STATE BEING TO SET IT IT'S A- UNDER THE SMALL YEAR PAYMENT OF A TO PAY TO. YEAH WELL I'LL SAY FOR THAT IS AND YOU KNOW ITS HARD TO SECOND SHOULD REVENUE PER PROJECTIONS J. SPECIFICALLY IF THEY WERE YOU DECLINE DAY WE HAVE TO WHAT THE WHOLE BUNCH SO EVERYTHING WOULD BE IN THE COUNTRY OF LIFE. NOT BEING SAID YOU KNOW THIS IS IN OBLIGATION THAT THAT ON THE STATE IS WORKING TO AFTER THEY WERE AND AMAZING HOW. AND THEIR IS KIND OF NOT REALLY SHALL IN THAT REVENUE. WHICH SHOULD OFFSET SOMEWHAT THE PRESSURE ON THE REST OF THE GENERAL. OKAY ONE FINAL QUESTION. WE HAVE SEEN DEFERRALS TO EDUCATION IN THE PAST AND- OTHER DEFERRALS AS I UNDERSTAND IT. I THOUGHT IT WAS FIVE POINT NINE BILLION I THOUGHT I HEARD JUST A LITTLE BIT AGO IT'S FIVE POINT THREE BILLION WHATEVER IT IS IT'S OVER FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. FOR K. THROUGH FOURTEEN EDUCATION HAS THERE BEEN ANY ANALYSIS OR REVIEW TO DETERMINE HOW ARE LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE THIS LEVEL. OF DEFERRAL. ROSS THE STATE. YES ON THIS QUESTION I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE ACCESS TO HOMES I THINK DEPENDING ON THE DISTRICT OF THE OR THE LA X. IT'LL DEPEND ON HOW IT COULD BE A NAY- EITHER CASH THEY HAVE ON HAND OR VERY SHORT TERM BORROWING A LITTLE OVER TO JUST. TO DISCUSS. HI THIS IS JESSICA HOLMES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. SO TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION SIMPLY MISTER ROTH YES WE DID WE HAVE BEEN- SPEAKING-WITH STAKEHOLDERS- AS WELL AS OUR COLLEAGUES OVER AT- PICK MATT. A FISCAL CRISIS MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE TEAM- AND WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT- RESERVE LEVELS. AND WE BELIEVE IT AS AS- I MENTIONED- YOU KNOW IT IT IT'S GONNA LOOK A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS COMES DISTRICTS AND BUILT UP SIGNIFICANT RESERVES- OVER THE LAST TEN OR SO YEARS. SOME AS LARGE BUT OVERALL AS A STATE RUN A FAIRLY STRONG POSITION. A RESERVE WISE- IN TERMS OF ED FOLKS ABILITY TO ABSORB THESE IF FOR THE TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE SOME DISTRICTS ARE CHARTER SCHOOLS. HAVE TROUBLE ABSORBING ON THE DEFERRALS AS WE HAVE- A PROPOSED TO THEN. WE DO INCLUDE LANGUAGE THAT ALLOWS DISTRICTS FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE COUNTY OFFICES THAT- TO DEMONSTRATE THE SCHOOL HARDSHIP TO BE EXACT FROM THE DEFERRALS IN THIS IS A SIMILAR. MECHANISM THAT WE USED IN THE LAST RECESSION TO ENSURE THAT THE DEFERRALS ARE CAUSING ANYONE TO- ALL INTO YOU KNOW FISCAL DISTRESS. OKAY WELL FOR YOU I HAVE SOME VERY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ON SPECIFIC ISSUES AND AGAIN I'LL I WILL DO FOR THOSE- TO THE BUDGET. SUBCOMMITTEE ONE HEARING WHICH WILL BE A WEEK FROM TODAY INCLUDING SOME VERY VERY SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE- CONCENTRATION. GRANT BASED ALLOCATION FORMULA FOR THE FEDERAL RELIEF FUNDS AS OUTLINED IN THE MAY REVISION BUT WITH THAT MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH. A TWO THIRDS REGINALD. MADAM PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE SENATE AND INDIVIDUALS AT FINANCE THAT ALEJO. THIS IS ANOTHER HUGE CHALLENGE FOR US AND AS I NOTED BEFORE WE'VE BEEN DOWN THIS TRAIL BEFORE. BUT THE QUESTION IS HAVE WE LEARNED. BY OF GREAT CONCERN TO ME IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR'S PROJECTED DEFICIT AND- THE LA ALL. THERE'S A SUBSTANTIAL GAP. AND THE QUESTION THAT I'D LIKE TO POSE TO FINANCE. MR VISION NOT AND DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE. AN ABILITY. TO RECONCILE THOSE TWO KEY FIGURES THIS IS WHERE THE BUDGET STARCH WHAT RESOURCES WHAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO US IS THAT POSSIBLE I GOT ABOUT THREE MORE QUESTIONS AFTER THAT BUT THIS IS RELATED TO THAT DISCREPANCY BETWEEN FINANCE AND THE LA PROJECTIONS. YES I'LL SPEAK AT VERY BRIEFLY YOU KNOW WE CERTAINLY DO YOU- YOU KNOW OUR BEST IN TERMS OF ESTIMATES AND WE ARE IN CONTACT WITH THE LA HOW AND IN TERMS OF STICKING WITH THE REVENUES LOOK LIKE CLOSE THIS YEAR. AND YEARS TO COME AND WE RECOGNIZE ALREADY THAT THERE IS A STRUCTURAL BUDGET DEFICIT. NEED TO EXPRESS OUR BUT WE ARE IN TEXAS NOW. LOOKING TO. OUR ESTIMATES. BUT I THANK YOU IT'S A TOUGH ONE BUT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT. THE ACT ALSO. PICK UP ON A DEEPLY HELD CONCERN OF MINE THAT GOES WAY BACK THROUGH MANY GOVERNORSHIPS. NOT JUST THIS PARTICULAR ONE BUT OUR CHAIRPERSON. WAS REFERRING TO THE DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY FOR DECISION MAKING TO THE ADMINISTRATOR FOR THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT BY THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH. AND MOST RECENTLY AND SB EIGHTY NINE A LOT MORE OF THAT OCCURRED. SOME OF IT HAS BECOME NOW JUST FACT OF LIFE. DO YOU SEE OR IS IT THE MINISTRATION POSITION THAT THIS DELEGATION WILL NOW BE TURNER OR WILL BE TERMINATED AT SOME POINT HERE IN THE FUTURE AS THIS PARTICULAR. EMERGENCY EXHAUST NOT THE ONE FROM THE FIRES BUT THIS PARTICULAR ONE IS IT ANTICIPATED THAT THIS ADDITIONAL BROAD AUTHORITY TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH THAT WILL BE THEN CURTAILED. YES SENATOR NIELSEN AYE WHEN IT COMES SPECIFICALLY Q. AND A TWO POINT NINE BILLION DOLLAR CONTINGENCY SIGNED. NAFTA CHAIR MENTIONED. THAT CONVENIENCE USES SPECIFICALLY FOR KOBE NINETEEN RESPONSE AND WE KNOW THAT COULD BE NINETEEN IS A MINUTE AWAY ABROAD CATEGORY TOUCHING ON PUBLIC HEALTH ON A RELATED SAFETY MEASURES AND HOW THEY RELATE TO OTHERS. AS YOURS. CERTAINLY RELATED DIRECTLY TO THE STAND SO WE DON'T KNOW WHEN IT WILL BE AN AXIOM WILL CALM MIND MY ACTUAL SATELLITE RETURNS AT SOME SENSE OF NORMAL OR IN YOUR NORMAL. BUT ONCE THAT HAPPENS TO. BE SUNDAY MARKETS ARE SPECIFICALLY FOR COMING NINETEEN WILL NOT BE NEEDED ANYMORE. YOU GOT THEIR SEPARATION AFTER MERGING SEE THAT ABLES THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH DRAW ON LEGALLY AVAILABLE SIGNS FOR EMERGENCY EXPENDITURES WILL BE CONTINUED OUT ONCE. HE IS NO LONGER CRISIS SO WHILE WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE TEMPORARY MEANS THE CRISIS IS SUCH AN UNUSUAL SITUATION. CERTAINLY ALL THE GOVERNOR'S AFGHANS AND THE EXTRAORDINARY THE SIDE THAT HE'S. BEEN USING THAT WE- TO. NEWS OF NORM ONCE SIX YEARS OVER. WELL I THEN SEE A TO WORK WITH THE AND TELL A AND CALL TO AND- LEGAL LANGUAGE. IN THIS BUDGET TO COME. THAT SOUL A SEARCH THAT AT CERTAIN TRIGGER POINTS THAN THAT LORI WILL REVERT TO THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH AT THAT SUPPORT RECONCILED. SENATOR NIELSEN BOOK ONE TWO NINE TONIGHT MISTER HIS HAND RAY PREDATORS OF LITTLE RISK TO THAT. YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU SENATOR NIELSEN FOR THE QUESTIONS. I THOUGHT I COULD ADDRESS BOTH IN THE THAT YOU'VE HAD SO FAR I WANTED TO JUST BEGIN WITH THE DIFFERENCE IN OUR LIVES IN OUR ESTIMATED BUDGET PROBLEMS OUR DEFICITS BECAUSE YOU RAISE THAT AND I DO THINK I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT QUESTION WE- MADE IT. THAT THE STATE COULD BE FACING A BUDGET PROBLEM OF EIGHTEEN BILLION TO THIRTY TO THIRTY ONE BILLION. WE CONSIDERED THAT EIGHTEEN BILLION TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH A SOMEWHAT MORE OPTIMISTIC ECONOMIC SCENARIO. AND THE THIRTY ONE BILLION TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH A SOMEWHAT MORE STICKS AN AREA. THE IMPORTANT THING IS I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE UNDERNEATH THE THOSE SURFACE LEVEL NUMBERS ARE REVENUE ESTIMATES ARE FUNDAMENTALLY REFLECTING A SIMILAR VIEW OF THE WORLD. IN THE IT'LL SHAKE SCENARIO OR THE PESSIMISTIC SCENARIO WE SEE A THIRTY NINE BILLION DOLLAR REVENUE DECLINE COMPARED WITH% JANUARY AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS A FORTY ONE BILLION DOLLAR DECLINE. SO THAT PART OF THE EQUATION IS FAIRLY SIMILAR I THINK WHERE WE DIFFER IS IN OUR METHODOLOGY FOR MEASURING THE BASELINE OF EXPENDITURES. THE GOVERNOR WHEN THE GOVERNOR'S NAME A NUMBER ASSOCIATED WITH THE NEIGHBOR VISION CAME OUT THANK WHAT IT DOES IS INCLUDES THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE JANUARY PROPOSALS. AND IT ALSO TREATS THINGS LIKE- INCREASED FEDERAL MATCHING FUNDS IN A DIFFERENT WAY WHERE AS WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE LA- WE RECOGNIZED THE INFLUX OF SEVERAL MATCHING SIGNS AS HELPING CHIU. THE DEFICIT OR THE BUDGET PROBLEM THE GOVERNOR DOES YOU BUT RATHER WORK INCLUDES TEN ON THE SOLUTION SIDES OF THEIR INCREASED FEDERAL DOLLARS WOULD HELP US SOLVE THE BUDGET PROBLEM. WHERE IS SORT OF USE THAN NOT FRENCH ISSUE THE BUDGET- SO SOME OF IT IS REALLY A MATTER OF. DOES SHE IN THE PARKING. BUT WE ARE HAVE DE CASE LOTUS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER CAL WORKS CASELOAD ESTIMATES THAN WE DO. AND THEY ALSO HAVE WELL THEY HAVE SIMILAR MEDI CAL CASELOAD ESTIMATES THEY HAVE A HIGHER PER CASE LOAD IN HOSPITAL FOR HER AT CASE- ACOSTA THEN WE'D USE UP. THE KEY DIFFERENCES IN CASE LAW. ARE OUT ON CAL WORKS SIDE JUST A HIGHER NUMBER ON THE MEDICAL SIDE HIGHER COSTS FOR CASE. WOULD IS TO. THE FUNDING FOR THE FOR COVERT RESPONSE. THINK THAT THE CHAIR AND USE SENATOR NIELSEN OR RAISING A VERY IMPORTANT POINT WE THINK THAT THERE IS ROOM FOR SOME DISCUSSION HERE AND WITH REGARD TO THE TWO POINT NINE BILLION PROPOSED CONTENT- COATED NINETEEN CONTINGENCY FUND. THAT IS BEING PROPOSED UNDER THE CONTROL SECTION THIRTY SIX PROCESS AND YOU KNOW WAIT IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO THE- BILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS APPROVED PREVIOUSLY. BUT YOU KNOW EVEN WITH THAT WE THINK THAT YOU COULD CONSIDER MAKING SOME AMENDMENTS YOU COULD REQUIRE THAT THE- NOTIFICATION ALSO INVOLVED LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL NOT JUST. A SIMPLE REPLICATION. COULD INCLUDE A REQUIREMENT THAT IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIC IN WHAT TYPES OF CONSERVE ELIGIBLE TO BE SPENT NOT JUST A BROAD CATCH ALL OF IT. EVERYTHING RELATED TO COPE. I'M YOU COULD ALSO REQUIRE AN INCREASED LEVEL AND MORE SPECIFIC OR DETAILED INFORMATION DISCLOSURE. THERE IN SOME CASES SO FAR WE HAVEN'T HAD AS MUCH OF THAT IS WE THINK WOULD BE. AND SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE ITEMS THAT WE THINK YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER AND WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU AND I THINK YOU KNOW THROUGH THIS. SORT OF THOSE. THIS IS. IT SECOND RESPECT WELL THAT IS IMPORTANT AND IT'S- BEEN GOING ON A VERY LONG TIME. AND PART OF THIS IS GOING TO BE VIEWED BY THIS NEXT QUESTION HELLO FROM A FRIEND THAT TO YOU THEN AT THIS POINT. YOUR PROJECT IN IS IF WE PROCEED WITH THIS BUDGET OUTLINED. WITH BEFORE US HERE. IF WE EXTEND UP TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE I BELIEVE IT IS WE WOULD END UP STILL WITH SOME SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN THE RED. IT AND THAT WOULD ARGUE TO THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT THAT WE BUILT IN OVER DECADES. IS THAT STILL HOW YOU SEE IT. ON THAT FOR ME STATE INTERNAL CENTERED ALIKE BUT I'M SORRY. I WASN'T SPEAKING INTO THE MIKE. THE YOU PROJECT NOW IN YOUR DEPARTMENT A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE OF ABOUT SIXTEEN BILLION IF JUST THIS OUTLINE IS WHAT WE USE TO GOVERNOR'S AS- WHAT IN THE BUDGET. THAT WOULD SEEM TO ME IT ARGUES TO THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT THAT WE WILL HAVE NOT CORRECTED EITHER IN OUR PAST TROUBLES OR IN THE CURRENT ONE. SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT IN THIS BUDGET THAT STRUCTURAL PROBLEM GET A SIXTEEN BILLION IN THE RED. A JUST A FEW YEARS OUT THERE TWENTY TWENTY THREE. RIGHT I THINK- YES WE AGREE THAT THERE IS. THERE'S STILL A STRUCTURAL PROBLEM UNDER THE NAY REVISION IN THE MULTI YEAR- FISCAL OUTLOOK AND CIRCLE WITHIN A REVISION. AND IT DOES- CULMINATE IN ABOUT A SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLAR PROBLEM AT THE END OF TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AND- YOU KNOW SO I DO THINK THAT THIS THIS BUDGET IS- RESPONDING IN SOME WAYS TO THE URGENCY OF THE CRISIS THAT HAS FALLEN THE STATE. AND IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE THAT NOT ALL OF THEM THE PROBLEM IS SOLVED- IMMEDIATE WE- BUT THAT IS WHY WE RAISE THE POINT THAT PRETTY MUCH ALL OF THE ONGOING SOLUTIONS IN THE PROPOSAL. OUR FIND THE- EXPENDITURE SIDE AND THEY'RE ALL PRETTY MUCH ALL ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRIGGERS SO THEY WOULD BE REMOVED YOU KNOW THAT I'M- TIONS THAT WE'RE IN THE BUDGET WILL BE. TRIGGERED OFF IF WE CAN INCREASE FEDERAL AID BUT OF COURSE IF WE DID GET THE FEDERAL AID IT WOULD ONLY LIKELY BE A TEMPORARY SOLUTION AND SO YOU WOULD HAVE THAT PHASING. OUT BUT ALL HAVE SOME OF THE YOU KNOW THE ADDITIONAL. UNDER THAT NOLES SUSPENSION AND THE LIMITS ON THE TAX CREDIT PROPOSALS. IN THOSE WOULD PHASE OUT AT THE END OF TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AND SO WHEN YOU HAVE SEVERAL OF THESE VARIABLES COMING TOGETHER AT THE SAME TIME. I THINK YOU KNOW IT CONTRIBUTES TO THAT SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR SO THAT THAT IS GOING TO STILL BE. AN ISSUE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONTEND. THAT IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS PROBABLY. THANK YOU IF I MAY THEM BACK TO MR. MISSION NOT PLEASE. CUT DIRECTOR OF FINANCE. THIS IS KIND OF AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THESE LONG TERM PLANS CAN GO AWRY. I'M CONCERNED ALWAYS ABOUT THE PLIGHT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE IN SERIOUS TROUBLE AND ONE OF THE PROPOSALS HERE IS TO. GIVE THE REST OF THE JUVENILE AUTHORITY AND HOUSING AND REHABILITATIVE EFFORTS OVER TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT. WHICH IS FOR TO SAVE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND- FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS I GUESS. BUT LET WITH THE STATE IS GONNA RECOMPENSE THOSE COUNTIES BY ONLY NINE POINT SIX NOW OUR LAST REALIGNMENT DID DOUBLE LOT OF RESPONSIBILITIES ON OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TYPICALLY OUR LOCAL JAILS. HOW CAN WE KEEP GOING DOWN THIS PATH OF SHIFTING MORE AND MORE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS. AND THEN JUST SAYING TO THEM WILL FIGURE IT OUT. THAT'S QUITE A DISCREPANCY FROM TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TO NINE POINT SIX DID I READ THOSE WRONG. SO I WILL MAKE ONE GENERAL POINT AND THEN I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE HERE AN ADWORDS SUCH A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHEN IT COMES TO THAT SPECIFIC PRO PROPOSAL NUMBERS ASSOCIATED WITH SEX THE OVERALL IS THAT WE- DEFINITELY ACKNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTAND RECOGNIZED AT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE UNDER THE SAME TAXES PRESSURES AT THE STATE. BUDGET CASES EVEN MORE AND IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS I AM WHEN IT CAME TO THE CRIME HIGHER SO WE FIND THAT NINE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS THEY CAME TO THE STATE- WE DECIDED THAT EVEN THOUGH THE STATE HAD FLEXIBILITY TO USE THAT FOR A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT STATE PURPOSES. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IN OUR PROPOSAL IN PATIENTS THAT MEANINGFUL PART OF THAT WHEN TO LOCAL. INCLUDED ABOUT ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS. A COUNTIES AND ENERGY MONEY FOR HOMELESS AND PUBLIC SAFETY FUNDING. THROUGH THAT PART OF SIMPLY COULD YOU. AND THE PROPOSAL ON OUR THOUGHT IS THAT THE ASSEMBLY SAVINGS GENERATED CAN HELP OFFSET SOME OF THE COSTA LET ME TURN IT OVER TO ERIN EDWARDS ELABORATE. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON THAT. FINANCE SO THE FIRST THING I WOULD I WOULD NOTE- RELATED YOUR QUESTION CENTER NIELSEN IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IN THE BUDGET YOU'RE IN TERMS OF OUR FUNDING IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF OUR TRANSITION OUR PLAN A TRANSITION DJJ LOCALS- THE PLAN IS TO DO THIS THROUGH ATTRITION AND SO IT'S NOT AN IMMEDIATE CHEFS- RESPONSIBILITY OR IN THE ARE CURRENTLY HAVE UNLIMITED WEALTH SO IT IS. WILL TAKE PLACE OVER. YOURS SO AT THE FUNDING IN THE FIRST YEAR IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF THIS TRANSITION I DOES NOT REFLECT THE FULL AMOUNT OF FUNDING- THE FULL NOT A FUNNY WILL GROW OVER TIME AND THAT WILL DEPEND ON THE NUMBER OF. YOU SHOULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN SOUNDS TO OUR STATE FACILITIES ARE WE ARE PROPOSING THE FINAL WAS AT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. PER YEAR. HI AND WE THINK THAT'S A FAIR RATE- BASED ON ON THE SERVICES THAT WILL THERE BE RISKS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING TO THIS YEAR'S- AND- THAT'S WHY DO YOU SEE THE NUMBER IN THE FIRST YEAR. QUITE MATCHING TO WHAT WE'RE SPENDING ON- OUR ON OUR DO NOT SO. THANK YOU AND LASTLY KIND OF AN OBSERVATION MADAM CHAIR. REGARDLESS OF WHAT WE DO IN OUR BUDGET IF THE ECONOMY DOESN'T REVIVE. SOME OF OUR COMMUNITIES AT LEAST ONE I KNOW OF WHAT EXISTS AND IS EXISTENCE. FEDEX VERY TINY PLACE. BUT WILL GO OUT OF EXISTENCE WITHOUT THE ECONOMIC RESURGENCE THAT WE ARE ALL HOPING FOR. AND I ENCOURAGE JUST AS WE PROCEED TO BE CONSIDERING. THAT VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR. YOUR BUSINESS IS CLOSING MANY OF NOT COMING BACK. AND THEN LASTLY DEPENDING ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT I THINK IS NOT THE BEST A VETS IN THE DAYS THESE TIME SEX JR THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR SENATOR PAN OF HISTORY MADAM CHAIR AND- IN APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION SIDE I THINK CERTAINLY I. FOR ONLY A SUPPORTIVE WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THE CONTROL ISSUES WHEN THINGS I WANT TO TOUCH ON IS THE ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH CO BID BUT ALSO HOW DON'T SEGREGATE I THINK THE FUNDING WHETHER SEVERAL OTHER THINGS TO DEAL WITH EMERGENCY. FROM THANKS LEAD THE OTHER ACTIVITIES IN THE BUDGET WHICH ACTUALLY. UNDERLIE OUR RESPONSE TO CODES I DO HAVE THREE QUESTIONS RELATION TO THAT- SO FIRST OF ALL I'M A START OFF. WE KNOW THAT BEAU'S FORMAL POPULATIONS ARE SENIORS- WE UNDERSTAND THAT. IS IT IS LIKE NURSING HOMES ARE PARTICULARLY. ACCOUNTABLE TO COVET DEBTS THAT PARTICULAR FOCUS WE SHOULD HAVE AS WELL IN TERMS OF TESTING AND PREVENTION. AS WELL BUT YET SAME TIME AS I LOOK AT THIS BUDGET YOU KNOW WE'RE MAKING CUTS TO SENIORS SWITCH INCLUDE ACTUALLY ELIMINATION OF PROGRAM LIKE. MS YOU KNOW THE MULTI PURPOSE SENIOR SERVICES PROGRAM AND SEE BASS WHICH ACTUALLY HELPS KEEP PEOPLE FROM COMING INTO NURSING HOMES SO I THOUGHT WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP PEOPLE OUT. OF IT ALSO HAS A COST BY THE WAY THEY END UP IN A NURSING HOME- WE'VE ALSO. INTERESTING ENOUGH WE'VE CONCERNED ABOUT FOOD FOR SENIORS AND YET WE'RE CUTTING NUTRITION. PROGRAMS FOR SENIORS AS WELL. THE SEEM TO BE SOMEWHAT COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. TO WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE- WHAT'S THE SOME OF THE EFFORTS THAT WE'RE DOING TO. TRY TO PROTECT SENIORS AND ALSO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THEM- YOU KNOW WE'RE ELIMINATING THE SENIOR COUNTY. WELL ACTUALLY RESTORING SENIOR PENALTY FOR MEDI CAL. TO WHICH WE DID LAST YEAR- OF COURSE SAID THIS WAS A NEW PROPOSALS EXPANSION MEDI CAL UNDOCUMENTED SENIORS ALSO. THOUGH RIGHT SO I GUESS MY FIRST QUESTION IS THAT GIVEN THE FACT THAT WHAT WE DO KNOW ABOUT ARE COVERED RESPONSES THAT WE NEED TO PROVIDE MORE ACCESS AND SUPPORT FOR SENIORS ALSO. TRY TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR- SENIORS OR INSTITUTIONS AND PREVENT MORE FROM GOING INTO THESE INSTITUTIONS HOW DOES HOW THESE PROPOSALS THIRD OF JIVE WITH THOSE GOALS THAT WE SEE AND PRESENT I HAVE TO DO SEE ENTRY FUNDING FOR NOW MAYBE IT'S GONNA COME ON THE MERCHANT'S DECIDE ON THE FEDERAL SIDE BUT YET I ISN'T IT IN PART A BUCKET. V. E. R. COVE A- POLLS BROWN'S SINGERS. YES SENATOR PAN A YES SENATOR AND- I THINK- YOU RIGHT THAT THERE IS A CONNECTION WITH WHILE WE'RE FOCUS WITH THE IMMEDIATE ON THE MEDIA OKAY NINETEEN RESPONSE ALSO CONNECTED THE BROADER WE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS. FOR CORPORATE. USUALLY AN ALTERNATE OVER TO MY CALL RIDING A IN OUR HHS UNIX IS THAT. YOU ARE THAT SEEM TO BE PROGRAM ARE YOU TAKE SOME COTS IN THE NAY REVISION. THERE DEFINITELY CANCELLED AND FOR THE MOST PART I THINK MOST OF. THE PROGRAM NATION ARE FEDERAL TRUCKERS SO I DON'T THINK YOU NEED TO SPEAK WITH A SECRET YOU MEMBERS OF CONGRESS FOR THEIR ACTION. THIS COURSE YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH ALL THE BUDGET PRESSURES AND HOW WE CAN BALANCE THE BUDGET. THE GOVERNOR'S FOCUS LIES ON MAKING SURE THAT. CORD TENNIS FOR SENIORS IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT WE MAINTAIN THE CURRENT ELIGIBILITY LEVELS FOR MEDICARE HOUSE MAKING SURE THAT THOSE WERE RECEIVING SSI STATE. PROGRAM CAME AND CONTINUE TO GET THOSE AT THE LEVELS AFTER GETTING RIGHT NOW ON. THOSE ALSO DISCUSSES. MAKING SOME REDUCTIONS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE PROJECT. REMEMBER TO RUN OVER TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DETAILS. I PAN RUNNING. SO IF YOU'LL ALLOW I. CURRENT CAN YOU HEAR ME OK IS I'M I'M ME TO SORRY THAT RYAN MILLER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SO I HAVE A FEW COMMENTS TO OFFER IN RESPONSE TO YOUR QUESTIONS BUT THEN I'D LIKE TO ALSO TURNED OVER TO MIKE TIGER WOODS WHO WILL BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE SERVICES ARE. I'M YOU KNOW CONCERN. THE SITUATION WITH NORTH HOME AND THEIR IMPORT ROLE RESPONSE TO THE KOBE SEARCH. I WOULD POINT OUT THAT WE ARE CONTINUING TO PROPOSE- REFORMS IN THE WAY THAT WE FINANCE NURSING HOMES THAT WILL INCREASE FUNDING TO THAT- BUT ALSO TRY TO. WE ALSO HAVE- JUST JUST ACTUALLY RECENTLY WERE APPROVED FROM CMS TO- BE ABLE TO HAVE A RATE ADDED ON FOR NURSING HOMES IN IN FOR ALSO- I SEE AFTER I'D INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITIES FOR THE DISABLED AND SOME OTHER FACILITIES. PERCENT IRATE ADD ON. WILL BE IN PLACE FOR FOUR MONTHS DURING THE MAY REVISION- FOR. HOSTAGE SEVENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND ABOUT FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET YEAR. ARE GUARDING THE- AGE OF ALL DISABLED ENSURING. OUR THAT WAS A PART OF LAST YEAR'S BUDGET- AS I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE THERE WERE. DELAYS IN IMPLEMENTING THAT GO. BUT YOU KNOW WHEN WE WERE LOOKING AT THE STRUCTURE FOR THE MAYOR VISION. ONE RILEY LOOKED AT AS AS MISTER MISS ONE OFTEN POINTED OUT WAS- TRYING TO MAINTAIN ELIGIBILITY FOR EVERYBODY WHO WAS ALREADY ENROLLED IN MEDICARE NOW WITH THE TIME OF THE MAYOR VISION WE HAVE NOT AND PROPOSAL SO WE ARE PROPOSING TO ACT- ONE OTHER AREA BEFORE AGAIN. THE MR TIRE. THE P. E. N. N. YOU KNOW TRACING IN OTHER GOOD RESPONSE EFFORTS- WHILE WE DO NOT HAVE THAT BUILT INTO THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC BUDGET THIS TIME- WE ANTICIPATE BE A PART OF THE PROPOSED CONTROL SECTION- ONE THING YOU KNOW ONE PERSPECTIVE I THINK TO OFFER ON THAT- WE'RE JUST NOW LEARNING FOR EXAMPLE ABOUT. IT WAS INCLUDE IN THE- THREE ONE FIVE READ FEDERAL AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS COMMUNICATED APPLICATION. THING THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE THROUGH THAT- DOES THAT INFORMATION WAS NOT AVAILABLE AS WE'RE PLAYING TOGETHER THE MAYOR VISION AND SO YEAH THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF. HOW IT IS CHALLENGING IN SOME WAYS TO BE ABLE TO THE BUDGET PROVIDED THE DEPARTMENTAL LEVEL- BUT WITHOUT TURNING TO THE ISLAND YOU CAN SEE THE OTHER. PROPOSAL SENIORS FOLLOW UP. STE AFTERNOON BRENT HOW'S YOUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE ONLY THING I WOULD ADD RELATED TO THE IT'S RELATED TO THE NUTRITION PROGRAM THAT THE CARES ACTED OFFER ADDITIONAL. AND THAT BUILT ON A FIVE MILLION THAT WAS ALLOCATED FROM THE FAMILIES FIRST ACTS SO- WELL THAT TWENTY FIVE MILLION HAS BEEN DISTRIBUTED TO THE TRIPLE. OF AGING. GEN SEES FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS SHOULD BE OUR OUR RELATIVELY QUICKLY. THAT'S ALL AT ONCE. YOU WELL I GUESS WHAT I WOULD JUST SAY IS THAT- I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE A- MY- GOD YEAH I AT THAT COULD TAKE A- SERVE MORE HOLISTIC VIEW OUR INTEGRATED VIEW OF THE BUDGET SO IT'S NOT LIKE OKAY HAVE STUFF OVER HERE BUT WHEN I GOT TALK ABOUT IT SO WE- CAN SEE THEIR TOTAL. A RECENT ACT IT'S OUR HE'S VERY SERIOUS BECAUSE- YEAH DOES IT SAID SOME OF IT DIDN'T SOUND VERY CONSISTENT- THE OTHER EXAMPLE MEDI CAL WE'RE EXPECTING AN EXPANSION A KEEPSAKE BOTH I THINK IT WAS WHAT TWO MILLION THANK. REMEMBER CORRECT. IN THE- SO I THINK TIME WERE ACT HE THERE'S A PROGRAM TO ACTUALLY GET MORE- HEALTH PROFESSIONALS PHYSICIANS DENTISTS OTHERS TO TAKE MEDI CAL PATIENTS YEAH SEEM TO EAT FIVE AND WROTE IT INTO GENERAL MEDI CAL YET WE'RE GONNA EXPAND CASELOAD MANY MORE DOC IS A NURSE AND DENTS AND OTHER TYPES OF FOLKS AND- AND THEN AS WE ARE GOING INTO A FIFTY SIX. WE ARE IT'S- IT ALSO MEANS THAT THAT'S FOR EXAMPLE FUND FOR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES AND SOME OTHER TYPES OF THINGS ESSENTIALLY BECOME ELIMINATED. AND THAT SO AGAIN CAN YOU SPEAK TO. THE FACT THAT WE ON ONE HAND WE'RE EXPECTING A CASE INCREASE AND MEDI CAL AND GET IT. WAS AROUND TEN YEARS AGO THE CUT BUDGET SO WE HAVE TO MAKE CUTS. SAME TIME THIS LOOKS ME LIKE WE'RE DOING IS OUR DESTRUCTIVELY ROLLING IN MONEY THAT THEN TAKES SENT ELIMINATE THE WHOLE HEAD OF PROGRAMS. CAPTAIN IT WOULD ABOUT WOMEN TIONAL BENEFITS AS WELL SO CAN YOU SPEAK. MAYBE THE STRUCTURAL PIECE OF IT WILL DIVE INTO THE SPECIFICS AND BY. BUT THE STRONG. AND THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY. PAY FOR THINGS LIKE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH PROGRAMS FUNDING TO BRING IN MORE THAT HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WILL TAKE CARE TO MEDI CAL PATIENTS WE'RE GOING TO. EXPECT THIS SIGNIFICANT INCREASE TO. SPEAK TO THAT AND WE'LL DIVE INTO DOLLARS SPECIFIC DOLLARS LATER IN SUBCOMMITTEE. YES ALL TURNED BACK OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE RIGHT NOW OR TO SPEAK ABOUT THIS. YEAH. YEAH HI AND THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS SENATOR AND- YOU KNOW WE ARE VERY AWARE OF THOSE CHALLENGES AND YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK THAT- YOU KNOW CLEARLY FOR EXAMPLE LAST YEAR WAS A PRIORITY IN THE GOVERNOR IN THIS ADMINISTRATION TO SURE THAT ALL FIFTY STATES RATHER NEWS WILL GOING PROVIDER PAYMENTS AND- IT. WILL GENTLY BUT- SYSTEM. I THINK THAT I WOULD JUST GO BACK TO YOU KNOW I'M MISTER. WHEN OPTIONS. ABOUT THE I GUESS THE KIND OF FRAMEWORK A STRATEGY THAT WE WERE TRYING TO APPROACH THE REVISION LEFT. ON IN A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION WITH A LARGE BUDGET DEFICIT THAT WE'RE FACING- AND IN A- PANIC- TRYING TO MAINTAIN ELIGIBILITY FOR. THEY HAD A AS A- POLICE YOUR VISION. AND SO WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR SECOND LARGEST GENERAL FUND PROGRAM. MATT CAL. AND YOUR CALLING FOR A BUDGET DEFICIT THEY TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN OUR COMMITMENTS AND THE RATES AND BENEFITS AREA- WOULD MEAN. HARDER CUTS IN IN EDUCATION AND OTHER PARTS OF THE BUDGET NAY REALLY PRACTICALLY IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SOLVE THE BUDGET DEFICIT EXACT SIZE WITHOUT HAVING TO MAKE SOME CUTS IN THE HEALTHCARE AREA YEAH IN A BUT ALL THAT. YOU KNOW AGAIN WOULD WOULD WOULD- YOU KNOW LOOK FORWARD TO DISCUSSING MUSICIANSHIP FURTHERANCE OF ME TO SAY BECAUSE- YEAH THAT'S IT YEAH I CAN RECOGNIZE THAT THOSE ARE GONNA BE JACKETS THE CARD SO I GUESS I JUST SAY IS THAT. WE GET THE DEFICIT WE GET THE AMOUNTS BUT EVEN WITHIN A CERTAIN AMOUNT EVEN IF YOU'RE MAKING A SIGNIFICANT. HOW YOU STRUCTURE TO SPEND ALSO MATTER SO WHAT HAPPENS IS A DID YOU MAKE THE CUT GOT THAT SO PAINS WAY WE STRUCTURED THE WAY THE MONEY FOR IT AND I THINK THAT THE PRINT THAT'S ALSO CONVERSATION AS WELL SO. I GOT THE I THAT WE DEFICIT CUT IN. SOME OF YOU AS- TALK ABOUT DISTRICT THE MINUTE WE SPEND THE MONEY WITHIN THOSE PARAMETERS OKAY SO WE HAVE THEM THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE THE ADDRESS THE DEFICIT THAT THE JUST ONE FINAL PIECE AGAIN- ANSWER SIMILARLY WERE EXPECTING A LARGE EXPANSION IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WILL ENTER THÅU WORK. WITH GETTING. SOMETHING I DON'T HAVE A COME. WHAT'S IMPLEMENTS IN CHILD CARE RESPECTFULLY TO GO UP- BUT YET AGAIN SIMILARLY. BASICALLY WE'RE MAKING REDUCTIONS THERE AT THAT SEEMS TO BE COUNTER PRODUCTIVE ACTUALLY IT PROBABLY JUST FOR A SECOND TIME WON'T ASK YOU TO RESPOND TO THIS TODAY HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE BUT LOOK FOR TO TALKING TO YOU. AND BUT SUBCOMMITTEE ABOUT IT IT JUST DOESN'T AGAIN SEEMS TO BE INCONSISTENT WITH A CASELOAD GOING YET WE'RE I GOT THE FACT THE DEATH BUT YOU KNOW WOULD HAVE STOOD IT. I THINK WE NEED TO BE. MORE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THE WAY WE'RE DOING THE CUTS IN A WAY THAT REFLECT WHAT THE GOALS THAT WE SEE IT HAPPENING BECAUSE OF ENDEMIC AND RESPONDING APPROPRIATELY TO THAT. AND LOOK AT THE TOP OF MY RESOURCE THAT'S GOING TO GO INTO THAT SO FOR EXAMPLE MAYBE JUST MAYBE SOME FEDERAL FUNDING. SHOW UP. BUT WE ALSO TO RECOGNIZE WHAT THE KEY IS LOADING CREATE. IT IT'S CHALLENGING TO SIMPLY SAY WE'RE GOING TO CUT THIS PROGRAM WILL GET THAT OUT WE'RE SPENDING TASTE. THE MANAGER THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'D LIKE TO PAN SIMMER MONEY. Q. CHAIR AND I WANT THANK. THE STAFF OF BOTH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SOME. IN THE LA- FOR. THEIR WORK ANNA. IN THEIR ENGAGEMENT WITH US TODAY. THERE'S BEEN REFERENCE TO. OUR LAST GREAT RECESSION ELEVEN. I CAME INTO THE ASSEMBLY THAT TIME IN ONE OF THE BIG DIFFERENCES WE RAN INTO A FORTY TWO BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT. BUT WE COULD TRACE THE CAUSES OF THAT TOO MALFEASANCE IN THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY MALFEASANCE THAT LED TO MANY PEOPLE LOSING THEIR HOMES LOSING JOBS THROUGH UNEMPLOYMENT BECAUSE BY THAT CASCADING. GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS THIS CRISIS IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT. IT'S A PANDEMIC AND WHILE WE DON'T KNOW THE COURSE THAT THE PANDEMIC WILL TAKE. WE DO HAVE THE CONFIDENCE OF KNOWING. WE WERE IN A STRONG ECONOMIC POSITION AT THE TIME OF THE PANDEMIC IN THAT WERE ABLE TO USE SOME OF THAT STRENGTH AS WE NOW TRY TO MANAGE THE CURRENT PROJECTED SHORTFALLS. THERE'S BEEN DIFFERENT ECONOMIC MODELS OF HOW WE MIGHT RECOVER THE SPEED OF THAT RECOVERY- BUT WE WILL RECOVER. STRONG TV IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN NATIONALLY THAT SAID I THINK OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGES THE UNKNOWN OF THE COURSE OF COVERT NINETEEN. IN THE DESIRE OF MANY TO RETURN TO ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND TRYING TO BALANCE THAT. TO WHAT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH AND REDUCING THE CURVE OF DEATH- FROM. END ILLNESS FROM COVERT NINETEEN. ONE OF THE CONCERNS AND I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM BOTH FINANCE AND LA- WE'VE HEARD FROM THE CITIES THAT WE REPRESENT. THEY'VE BEEN ON THE- BUT ONE SERVE PUBLIC SAFETY RESPONSE FIRE POLICE OTHER SERVICES THEY'VE LOST REVENUE STREAMS TO THE CITIES AS I UNDERSTAND THE CURRENT. PROPOSED A RE. THE GOVERNOR SEEKS CORRECT SOME OF THE CARE IS MONEY THAT WE'VE ALREADY BEEN ALLOCATED FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION TO THE CITIES AND I THINK ONE POINT TWO OR ONE POINT THREE BILLION TO THE COUNTIES. I'M THERE'S CERTAIN FROM CITIES THAT I REPRESENT I KNOW THAT OTHERS REPRESENT SMALLER SO THE CENTER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND POPULATION CITY CENTER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND POPULATION. AND ACTED SHORTFALLS FOR CITIES OF UP TO SEVEN BILLION IT SEEMS LIKE ONE OF THE UNKNOWN. AS WE TRY TO NAY OUT OF THIS CRISIS IS QUITE FEDERAL MONEY MAY BE AVAILABLE IN THE MAY REVISE HAS CRAFTED. A STRUCTURE WITH TRIGGERS BASED ON FUTURE FEDERAL MONEY. SO I HAVE ONE OTHER FOLLOW UP QUESTION TO THIS BUT I'D LIKE TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHAT APPEARS TO BE THE AND ADEQUACY. OF THIS DIRECTION OF THERE'S SUPPORT FOR OUR CITIES. THERE'S ALSO CONCERN OF SOME OF IT BEING DIRECTED THROUGH COUNTIES TO THE CITY'S. WHICH IS GOING TO DEPUTISE ARE COUNTIES TO BE AUDITOR'S IN PASS THROUGH. WHY CAN'T SOME OF THIS GO DIRECTLY TO CITIES SO THEY CAN PUT IT TO USE OR BEST NEEDED SO I'D LIKE TO HEAR THE ANSWERS TO THAT I DO HAVE JUST ONE FOLLOW UP QUESTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR MINING AND THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN ON THE GOVERNOR'S MIND IN THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS AS WELL ALL JUST NEED. TO BRIEF COMMENTS AND THEN I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY ALL 8% SHELTER. I THINK THE FIRST COMMENT IS I BELIEVE THAT WAY START FIFTEEN COUNTY OR AT FIFTY JOHNNY'S YES I WAS SIX CITIES AROUND THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO. IN A STATE WITH FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AND NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED CITIES SO MOST OF THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IN THE STATE DID NOT RECEIVE A DIRECT ALLOCATION UNDER THAT FUNDING SO I THINK THE FIRST THING THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS TIMES AND HOPEFULLY AND I CAN READ MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE WHILE WORKING. WITH MEMBERS OF THE CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION IS SAYING THAT IN ANY FURTHER. COMMENT DISCUSSED WITH THE TRADERS WE'RE HOPING THAT AT SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL FEDERAL ACTION COMES NOT ONLY. INCLUDES STATE HELLO MANAGE OUR OWN BUDGET PICTURE BUT ALSO INCLUDE. FURTHER DELAY KNOWLEDGE. TO LOCAL CHURCH. INCLUDING THOSE FEWER THAN FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE LEFT OUT OF THAT ACTION. I THINK THE SECOND POINT IN THIS WORLD FROM IT OVER TO KRISTIN IS THAT- WE CAN'T SIMPLY WAIT I SAY WELL WE HOPE THE CONGRESS DOES MORE OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE TO SCHOOL CONSTRAINTS THAT. ALL OF US TOGETHER ARE DEALING WITH AS WE ALL WORK OUT. IN THE NEXT MONTHS AS YOU NINETEEN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS RATINGS RIGHT NOW AND NOT. I EVEN THOUGH NINE AND HOW BILLION DOLLAR I WAS FOR SOMEONE. IT WAS A PRIORITY AT FOR THE GOVERNOR IN THE NAY REVISION OPPOSING THE USE OF THE TIMES SEND PORTIONS OF IT TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ACTUALLY DISCUSSED WE KNOW THAT TIME. WE THAT THEY'RE FACING FALLING REVENUE JUST AS WE ARE AND WE HAVE STRONG PARTNERSHIPS WITH COUNTIES WHEN IT COMES THAT PUBLIC SAFETY HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES HOMELESSNESS THAT CITIES AS WELL. KRISTIN THINGS TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE NOW DESTRUCTION. AND I THINK THAT THERE IS A LOT MORE TO DO HERE. AND SO CHRIS JOHNSON DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS MY COLLEAGUE NOTED WE DID ALLOCATE A PERSON AT THE STATE'S NINE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THAT MONEY IS IN ADDITION A FIVE POINT EIGHT BILLION THAT WENT DIRECTLY TO ABOUT 84% OF OUR- AND- COUNTIES AND CITIES BASED ON POPULATION DIRECTLY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO WHAT. THE POINT THREE BILLION THAT IS ALEX TO. IT IS ALLOCATED BASED ON KIND OF TWO MAIN COMPONENTS RELATIVE TO. THEIR SIZE SO THE FIRST IS FOR THOSE CITIES IN COUNTY COUNTIES WITH POPULATIONS BELOW. FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND WE ARE OUT EATING APPROXIMATELY 50% OF THE ONE POINT THREE BILLION. RANGE FROM MY FIFTY THOUSAND FOR BETTER SMALLER ANY UP TO ABOUT FIFTY MILLION FOR LARGER COUNTIES IN THAT AREA- WITH AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT FIFTEEN AM MILLIONS. AT IN ADDITION WE ARE ALLOCATING THE REMAINING 50% ALSO TO THOSE COUNTIES THAT RECEIVE SOME OF THE DIRECT STIMULUS FUNDING AND WE DIVIDED THAT INTO TWO PRIMARY GROUPS LINE WHERE 45% IS. DIVIDED AMONG THE COUNTY HAS THAT RECEIVES DRIVE ALLOCATIONS AND THEN THE REMAINING 55% IS A DIVIDED AMONG THE COUNTY IS THAT- ALSO RECEIVE DIRECT ALLOCATIONS BUT DID NOT HAVE ANY CITY LOCATION SUBTRACTED FROM THEIR WORDS. I'M IN TERMS OF THIS IS WE ARE ALLOCATE FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND PRIMARILY DIRECTED AT PUBLIC SAFETY AND HOMELESSNESS. AND IT IS THE WAY IT BETWEEN KIND OF- THE SEVEN CITIES HAVE POPULATIONS BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED AND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND WITH YOU HEARD TWENTY FIVE MILLION GOING TO THOSE CITIES. AND THEN- TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION GOING TO THE BALANCE I DON'T WANT IMPORTANT NOTES AND I CERTAINLY GIVE HER THE BEST AND WE EXPERIENCED. CRIME WELL THERE RIDLEY PROHIBITED FROM BEING ABLE TO BE ALLOCATED TO DEAL WITH THE MAGNITUDE OF THE REVENUE LOSSES FIRST EXPERIENCE OF THE STATE LOCAL LEVEL AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW IS CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE FACED WITH THE- DROP AND USE YOUR ARE YOUR HERE FIGURES AND- RANGERS. FORTUNATELY DO YOU HAVE ABILITY TO USE THOSE FUNDS TO ADDRESS THOSE TREMENDOUS DROPS IN REVENUE. SEC LA- HAVE ANY COMMENT ON THIS. HI IT'S SENATOR MINING I NORMALLY WE WOULD HAVE AT THIS POINT HAVE ANY COMMENT ON THE PARTICULAR- ALLOCATIONS THAT THE NEIGHBOR VISION IS PROPOSING AS IT JUST NINE POINT FIVE BILLION TO THE- THIS IS INCLUDING TO THE CAT. TO THE CITIES YEAH I WOULD AGREE WITH. THIS RECESSION DIFFERS FROM OUR MOST RECENT RECESSION IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND NINE. WHICH WAS DRIVEN BY. AN ACTUAL CRISIS AND SO THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT IN THIS CURRENT. SITUATION IT DOES SEEM THAT THE BANKING SYSTEM AND HOUSEHOLD ON SHEETS IN GENERAL ARE SOMEWHAT HEALTHIER. AND THEY WERE AT THAT TIME WHICH COULD PROMOTE PUBLIC SOMEWHAT FASTER ECONOMIC RECOVERY. REALLY WHY CREATED A U. SHAPED. IN OUR SPRING OUTLOOK SO THAT YOU COULD SEE IN THE EVENT THAT IT DID START TO LOOK LIKE THAT TYPE OF A- PERSON WAS OCCURRING YOU CAN SEE WHAT THE FISCAL IMPLICATIONS OF THAT MIGHT BE. BUT OF COURSE AS YOU ALLUDED TO I THINK THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY VERY HIGH LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY. NOT JUST THE REST WE HAD. ALSO HAVE PEOPLE'S RESPONSE TO THE VIRUS WHEN WILL THEY BE COMFORTABLE RESUMING THEIR ACTIVITIES AS THEY WERE BEFORE AND THEN THIRD JUST KIND OF. A THIRD DIMENSION TO THE UNCERTAINTY IS JUST THE REGULAR FORECAST YOU KNOW THAT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN IN THE COURSE OUT OF IT SO. I THINK THEN YOU KNOW THE POTENTIAL FOR US RECOVERY IS VERY PLAUSIBLE AND- I WOULD NOT ARGUE WITH ANY OF THE POINTS HAVE BEEN MADE ABOUT THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FEDERAL AID THAT WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE QUITE HELPFUL FOR. FOR THE STATE'S BUDGET SITUATION IN THAT THE- CURRENT YEAR AND NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN THE MAN IN CHAIR. ONE OTHER AREA AND I REALIZE WILL FILL IN SOME OF THE CENTER SUB COMMITTEES. BUT I JUST KNOW. OUR HOSPITALS IN OUR CARE WORKERS. THEY'VE BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES OF NOT ONLY. MANAGING AND TREATING VICTIMS OF COVERT NINETEEN BUT ALSO PREPARING TO EXPAND CAPACITY FOR ANTICIPATED INCREASES IN NUMBERS SO CALLED SURGE- IN AS A RESULT OUR HOSPITALS HAD TO REALLY REORIENT THEIR ECONOMIES BOTH PUBLIC CONSTABLES AND PRIVATE HOSPITALS. REORIENT THEIR THEIR BUSINESS MODELS TO BE FIRST AND FOREMOST RESPONSIVE TO COVERT NINETEEN DEMANDS BUT ÍEN THEIR NORMAL BUSINESS MODELS AND JUST ANY THOUGHTS ON HOW HE MAINTAIN. THE A CUTE CAPACITY OF OUR HOSPITALS AND HEALTH WORKERS TO CONTINUE TO RESPOND A COVERT NINETEEN TO CONTINUE TO FOLLOW OUR PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS ON TIMING IN TIME TABLE FOR. EASING BACK INTO BUSINESS AS USUAL BUT HOW DO WE HELP OUR HOSPITALS IS THERE ANYTHING IN THE BUDGET DESIGNED TO FILL THE GAP OF THOSE LOSSES OF OUR PUBLIC HOSPITALS PRIVATE HOSPITALS. AND THEN I'LL JUST CLOSE WITH THIS IF. ANY ANY INSIGHT ANY COM STATIONS INVOLVING U. S. SENATE OR THE ADMINISTRATION ON ENGAGING IN NEGOTIATION ON FOR FURTHER FURTHER RELIEF I'D APPRECIATE ANY COMMENT ON THAT AS WELL THANK YOU. SENATOR MONEY ON THAT ISSUE AT HOSPITAL HEALTH I'LL JUST MAKE TWO BRIEF COMMENTS AND THEN I'LL TURN IT OVER TO RIGHT NOW NO OR IN OUR THAT YOU MENTIONED AT THE END THE- FEDERAL FUNDING AND- IN THE MOST RECENT LEGISLATION THAT WAS ACTUALLY ENACTED. DID INCLUDE SOME FUNDING FOR HOSPITALS BUT WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT THEY NEED IS GREATER AND WHILE THE NAY REVISION. GIVING PRESSURE. ALL THIS TORRENT THAT OLD MY ONE. WE ARE MAKING SURE BOTH IN OUR DIRECT RESPONSE YEAH KOBE NINETEEN AND- IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE WE ARE SEARCHING PASSED THE AND ALSO THINKING THROUGH THE DIFFERENT FACES ARE GETTING BACK TO SOME SEMBLANCE OF THE NEW NORMAL. MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE KEEPING THE CONSIDERATION OF THE HEALTH OF OUR HOSPITAL SYSTEMS INCLUDING A PUBLIC HOSPITAL SYSTEMS IN MIND. AND I CERTAINLY TOP OF MIND AND THEN I THINK. THE SECOND THING IS- WE WERE HAVING A CONVERSATION BEFORE ABOUT OUR DIFFERENT HEALTH AND INVESTMENT IN HEALTHCARE INVESTMENTS WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE EVEN AS THE BUS DOES. A SIM CARD. IN THIS. WE ARE THINKING OF. HEALTH HOSPITALS. AMERICAN. SIX THREE. SPEAK ABOUT. THANK YOU SO HOW YEAH CONCERN THE FEATHER FUNDING THAT THE BACK MENTION HOSP IN CALIFORNIA HAVE RECEIVED NEARLY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE FEDERAL PROVIDER RELIEF FUND I THAT WAS PASSED AS A PART OF THE- CARES ACT I IN ADDITION- SOME OF THE FEDERAL HEALTH CENTERS HAVE GOTTEN THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS I BELIEVE ROUGHLY FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ARE THAT THERE ARE OPTIONAL. BE MADE AND RECENT FEDERAL LEGISLATION I THINK THE KERRS THREE POINT FIVE ACT INCLUDED ANOTHER SIXTY FIVE OR SEVENT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS NATIONWIDE- SO WE CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE DEVELOPMENTS ABOUT HOW THOSE FUNDS HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH HOSPITALS AND PUBLIC HOSPITALS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY AND- COMPARE. THE HOSPITAL'S WORSE THAN IT. YOU KNOW I COULD IT'S DEFINITELY TO SAY THAT THERE FOR SOME SIGNIFICANT AS HAS BEEN MY REPORTED IN WE'VE HEARD DIRECT FROM FROM THE WE DO NOT PROPOSE ANY NEW STATE FOR A- IN A REVISION COURSE DOING SO AS SOON IN THE BUDGET STRUCTURE IS FIXED WOULD REQUIRE EVEN MORE REDUCTIONS IN OTHER AREAS AND I THINK THAT IN THAT CONTEXT. AND WE UNABLE TO PROPOSE THAT THE MAYOR VISION- I THINK I JUST ALSO ECHO THE OTHER COMMENTS THINK IT'S BEEN PRETTY WIDELY MADE. ABOUT THE- FUNDING IN ADDITION FEDERAL IS FOR THE OPRY'S. I THINK YOU LA HAVE ANY COMMENT ON HOSPITAL PUBLIC HEALTH FRIEND I WOULD THAT OFFER AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MY COLLEAGUE MARK NEWTON- NEWS ON ON THE MEETING HERE P. HAS ANY POINTS TO WEIGH IN ON. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING HE DOESN'T HAVE A CAMERA BUT MEMBER. THERE'D SEARCHING THE PARTICIPANT LIST NOW BUT- OKAY COULD YOU REPEAT THE NAME. HIS MARK NEWTON HE WAS A DEPUTY LEGISLATIVE ANALYST AND YEAH I WAS GONNA ASK HIM TO HELP RESPOND THE COURT. WE ON DISSIDENTS LIVE.

AND A PLEASURE TO TALK TODAY SENATOR MITCHELL AND MEMBERS- YOUR- QUESTION ABOUT THAT I'M PUBLIC HOSPITALS. AND PUBLIC HOSPITAL AND THAT- WHETHER THERE WAS ANY SORT OF ANYTHING THAT SORT OF ADDITIONAL IN THE- IN THE IN THE BUDGET TO. COULD USE YOUR HELP THE TERM. AND AFTER TO MENTION THIS SURVEY HAS BEEN SOME SO DIRECTS FEDERAL AGENT YEAH AND ACTUALLY TWO OF THE FEDERAL TAXES- A GOOD CRAPPIE TO HOSPITAL. PROVIDERS AND THAT IS TO THE BEING BEING DISTRIBUTED STRIPPED DOWN AND THAT THAT- IT IS VERY RELEVANT- WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE AT THE TOTAL NUMBERS OF THE THAT'S FOR THE TOTAL HALL BUDGET. HE ACTUALLY. ALTHOUGH YOU CAN ALL BY THANK CANCER OVER EMPHASIZE THAT THE WILL THAT FEDERAL FUNDS ARE ARE PLAYING BUT INTRO OF SORT OF WHAT THE STATE CAN DO I THINK SOME THE QUESTION OF A VERY SENATORS TODAY ON ON THE ISSUE OF THE JOURNAL YEAH BUDGET THE BUDGET PROPOSED BUDGET SOLUTION THROUGH THE LAND- HOW DO THEY- DO THEY POTENTIALLY WORK AT AT CROSS PURPOSES- THE- THE PANDEMIC RESPONSE WHEN YOU SAY THAT DEMI FIND WE WERE TALKING. OFFICEDEPOT BUT A RISK. ECONOMIC RESPONSE. AND WE'RE CERTAINLY HAS BEEN A CURRENTLY SERVES VALUE WAITING AREA PROPOSAL BUT THERE IS PROPOSED FOR INSTANCE TO ANSWER THE THIS BROWN TALK WORK. WILL GRAHAM ANY AND PERHAPS IN LOOKING AT THE LANDS ENDEMIC RESPOND THAT WHEN THE QUESTION WHETHER THAT IS- YOU'RE LOOKING AT CROSS PURPOSES AND WITH THEIR OTHER- I THINK BUDGET SOLUTIONS THAT DON'T. SO DIRECTLY SERVICE PACK FOR THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE SO- MISTRESSES CORRECTLY REALLY ISN'T THAT- ANYTHING CORRECT. PULLS BUT WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT THE ISSUE AND LOOKING AT POTENTIAL POP. ALTERNATE BACK THAT MADE NAY ADDRESS THE ISSUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I GUESS BUT HE WON'T.

THANK PEOPLE LAST FOUR HUNDRED SIXTEEN. THEY GOT THIRTY SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE HUNGRY YOU KNOW. WHY THE ADMINISTRATION HAS CHOSEN NOT TO WHAT SUSPEND SCHOOL TESTING FOR A YEAR OR THESE ADA REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE THAT SAVES THE STATE'S THE MONEY. AND YOU KNOW THE HEALTHY CALIFORNIA COMMISSION WHERE IS THAT RIGHT OKAY. LET ME WE IT SEEMS IN RESOURCE WHAT A LITIGATION ATTORNEY COSTS- YOU KNOW THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY CONSERVATION NATURAL RESOURCES IS THAT AN ANOMALY OR WE'VE BEEN SUED OR SUING.

SERVICE NUMBER COULD YOU REPEAT THE NAME OF YOUR TEAM MEMBER PLEASE. YES SERGIO AVELAR AG YOU HI HOW ARE YOU. THE THIRD DRIVER FINANCE.

ARE NOT ABLE TO WORK. THE EUROVISION BUT THEY'RE NOT A- OKAY I'LL SKIP IN INCOME THE CHIEF WAS TALK ABOUT THIS FUNDS IN THE CORE MISSIONS THAT THAT THESE AGENCIES HAVE TO DO AND ALL B ASKING THE AIRPORT ABOUT THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL BOARD BUT IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTION YOU HAVE. OUR AIRPORT ACCOUNT AND THE UNIVERSAL LIFETIME LIFELINE SERVICE AND THEN THERE'S TRANSFERS FROM THE CONGESTION MANAGEMENT RELIEF- AND THE STATE HIGHWAY FUND CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TRANSACTIONS. WHY ARE SOME FUNDS BEING TERMED IS LOANS AND OTHERS ARE BEING CERTAIN IS TRANSFERS BECAUSE I HEARD AT THERESPONSE TO THE CHEERS QUESTION THAT THESE WILL BE PAID BACK. SO THE SPECIAL FUND LOANS WILL ALL BE PAID BACK WHEN IT COMES TO THE SPECIFIC ITEMS LET ME TURN IT OVER TO MARK WHO CONVERSES TRANSPORTATION. FOR FINANCE. YES WORK WHEN ROAD APARTMENT FINANCE AND- THAT'S CORRECT WE HAVE- THERE'S- SOME SOME FUNDS WHICH YOU KNOW YOU MENTIONED THE LOCAL AIRPORT LOAN ACCOUNT AND WE ARE BORROWING THOSE FUNDS- THIS COULD BE- COULD BE- TAKEN IT KIND OF DEPENDS ON THE NATURE OF THE FINE YOU LOOK AT THE LIFE LINE FIND- THE END. THAT SHE DOES FUNDS ARE SUPPOSED BE. THERE FROM RATE. IS THE FORCE FUNDING THAT PROGRAM. AND SO WE HAVE. THREE TO BUY THEM WE HAVE OUR THE PAST EIGHT THEM SO REALLY TERMS OF ONES ARE WHICH ONES ARE IT CAN BE. ON THE NATURE OF THE PROGRAM IT ALSO. ANY OTHER SOURCE GESTURE TO OR IN THE CASE OF TRANSPORTATION- CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE STATE HOW WE CAN THE TRAFFIC CONGESTION RELIEF FUND- THE FUNDS THAT WERE TAKING AND THOSE ARE NOT PROTECTED BY ARTICLE NINETEEN CONSTITUTION. PROTECTS MORE OTHER. IN FUNDS. AND SO THIS CASE IS WERE ABLE TO JUST TRANSFER THEM. ALTHOUGH I'M SURE MY CALL ON THE OTHER SIDE THE I WE'VE SOME. PROBLEMS WITH THE MORE MOTOR VEHICLE.

THIS ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO KEEP UP- BUT YOU WANTED SOME FOR ADMINISTRATIVE FLEXIBILITY MORE TALKING ABOUT THOSE CONTROL ACCOUNTS AND I HEARD YOU SAY THAT THIS FLEXIBILITY WAS NECESSARY PARTICULAR WITH THE FEDERAL FUNDS BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T KNOW. YOU KNOW WHAT HOW THIS FEDERAL FUNDS WERE SHIFTING YOU TO ME. HOLES IN THE BUDGET ONE WITH CAN TRADE A FLOOD. FOR THE ADMINISTRATION THAT WILL BASICALLY DETERMINE WHERE THE PRIORITIES WILL GO ON THE 40% DISCRETIONARY FUNDS AND I SEE THAT DEPARTMENTS WOULD BE DIRECTED TO PARK YOUR TOWARDS. YOUR TORY PRIORITIZE THEIR NON DISCRETIONARY- BUCK COSTS NOT THE LEGISLATURE NOT THE THAT THE SENATE OR THE ASSEMBLY AND THEN THE CONSUMER FOR. YOU'VE GOT LOT OF MONEY ASKING THE FUND THAT YOU KNOW- BUT WE'RE WE'RE TOLD I THINK THE LANGUAGES IS THAT THERE WILL BE TRAILER LANGUAGE BILL THAT WILL GIVE BILL BUT JUST SWITCH.

WITH FEDERAL KIND MY AND IS NOW BECAUSE LOTS THE FEDERAL KIND OF MINE. WE WISH THAT MANY OF THEM WOULD BE TO. BUT BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT MIGHT BE FOR CALL BACKS. ARE GOVERNMENT ARE GOING TO BE.

AND IT IS ONLY THAT THOSE CAN BE ARE MAX THAT SOMEBODY'S. SERVICES I SO HAPPY TO QUESTIONS ON OF THOSE AREAS BUT HE STARTED OF THINGS THAT WE WANT MAKE SURE THAT WE INTO BUDGET AS WE TOWARDS SIXTEENTH WHAT CONCERNS ME IS THAT THE LA ENDED HIS. PRESS THAT IT THAT SOME OF THE PROPOSALS. LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT AT LEAST ON THE 40% OF THE CAP AND TRADE. YOU KNOW YOU'VE PICKED PROGRAMS THAT DON'T REDUCE EMISSIONS I MEAN WHILE FAITH IN AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER IS LAUDABLE AND FOREST THEM FIRE PROTECTION THE BALL YOU'VE GOT MONEY. AT NEW. USE FOR YOU EVER GET. IS WE SEE. TO DO IT YOU KNOW AND I KNOW THAT I'M WE THERE'S GOING TO BE AN OPTION ON THE CAP AND TRADE AND I AND I TO HAVE MAJOR CONCERNS OVER THE SIGNALS THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION IS GIVEN TO THE MARKET ON WHETHER THEY ARE SERIOUS ABOUT PRICING IN MISSIONS IN ORDER IN THE FUTURE FOR THAT IT IT IT IT REFLECTS THE COST ON SOCIETY IT'S- EIGHT EIGHT TO WIN AND TEST GOING ON AB SEVENTEEN AND TEST THANK YOU THESE WITH THE- POLLUTION IS REDUCE 40% LOSS AT. RESET BUT YOU'RE DOING THE WORK RIGHT AND WE HAVE A PROPOSAL THAT COULD MINISTRATION CHARTS OUT FOR THE NEXT EIGHT NINE YEARS HOW YOU'RE READING THOSE THOSE PRICES YOU HAVE A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY WITH THE AIRPORT TO START REGULATIONS TO DO THAT AND THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE THAT READ THAT AT. TO THE CORE PROBLEM IN THIS WHEN YOU'RE- A- YOU YOU CARE ABOUT THE SAID THE A COMMUNITY SO I HOPE THE ADMINISTRATION IS SERIOUS ABOUT THIS. I EXPECT YOU CAN RELATE TO THE PEOPLE AND SUB TO THAT WE WILL BE ASKING SOME DIFFICULT QUESTION. AND I. THE ACT ALSO MY TIME THAT SENATOR DORADO. FEDERAL REMEMBER TO SPEAK DIRECTLY INTO THE MIKE THANK YOU OKAY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I JUST ARE I WAS TRYING TO. COME UP WITH QUESTIONS AND NOT GET TOO SPECIFIC- ON THE OTHER HAND TRYING TO SEE WHAT IS IT THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH WITH THIS UP WITH HIS BUDGET. THERE'S SO MANY THINGS THAT WE COULD PUT IN SO MANY DETAILS BUT WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO. END UP WITH AT THE END OF THE AT THE END OF THE DAY AND IT'S REALLY HARD BECAUSE- OF. FOR ME. ONE MAJOR GOAL IF NOT THE TOP GOAL TO SHOULD BE TO TAKE CARE OF THE MOST VULNERABLE. OUR PEOPLE IN THE STATE. ARE THE ONES THAT WERE ALREADY FULL NOBLE AND BECAME EVEN MORE VULNERABLE I TRIED TO USE THAT AS A- WAY TO GUIDE MY QUESTIONS- SO THE FIRST QUESTION I HAVE IS. WHAT WAS THE CRITERIA WHAT WAS THE THOUGHT BEHIND DECIDING WHICH ROLL BACKS UP FROM JANUARY'S PROPOSED BUDGET- YOU KNOW WOULD YOU WOULD YOU TAKE UP. YES SENATOR DRAWS SO WHEN IT CAME TO THAT ROLL BACKS- FROM JANUARY AND THE ADMINISTRATION PUT OUT OF BUDGET LETTER IN MARCH APRIL AYE IF THIS SPRING EITHER MORE STRAIGHT ACROSS MY DIRECTING AND DEPARTMENTS AGENCIES OR SUBMITTING BUDGETS SOULS YOU THINK ABOUT. IN THE CONTEXT OF A BUDGET RANGE DURING OUR. GAINES BUT WE HAVE A TWENTY NINETY BUDGET ACT AND AS WE CAN ALL SEE WITH NEIGHBOR. I EVEN HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT GIVEN THAT. TENDERLY DOLLARS IN DAIS THAT ARE WITHIN THAT. SO WHEN IT CAME TO THE PROPOSAL'S INDIANA. I SAY NEAR EVERYTHING WAS ON THE WAS THE LIST FOR ROLLED BACK IN ITEMS THAT WERE NOT ROLE BACK YOUR MADE SIGNATURE. REALLY RELATED SIMPLY. WILDFIRES YOU. THE PRIMARY CATEGORY AND I CAN GO BACK AND JUST ALL UP INTO OF SPECIFIC ITEMS I DON'T KNOW THOSE ARE WAS IN THE NAME. OUR BACKS MOST OF THE MAJOR I DON'T. NEW X. THAT WORK OF JANUARY WERE PULLED BACK THE GOVERNOR WILL IT IS VERY DISAPPOINTED ABOUT THAT THIS CITED THAT. YOU KNOW THE PRICE CONFERENCE THAT I JUST LAST FOR NEARLY HOURS. ABOUT THE DIFFERENT CAUSAL THANK YOU THE WORLD THAT WE ARE A NOT ALL EVERY COASTAL FROM JANUARY HAS TO WHAT'S WRONG. AND ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE COLD WITH NINETEEN WHERE WE KNOW THAT. ONE OF THE MOST VULNERABLE- OF GROUPS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE OVER SIXTY FIVE AND SO IT SEEMED TO ME TO FIT IN AND IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN. FACTORED IN WAS THOSE THAT ARE MOST VULNERABLE UNDER NOT ONLY GENERALLY BUT- ESPECIALLY IN THIS ENVIRONMENT OF COLE BUT COLE BUT NINETEEN. AND THE ARE EXTENDING THAT TO SUCH A SMALL. ADDITIONAL NUMBER OF ON COVERED UNINSURED. IT SEEMED TO ME TO MAKE THE MOST SENSE THEY'RE THE ONES WHO CAN BECOME THE MOST VULNERABLE THEY ARE THE MOST AND- IN ADDITION TO THAT WE'RE FINDING NOW. THAT OF CERTAIN GROUPS ETHNICALLY ARE BEING IMPACTED FAR MORE. I THINK SOME OF THIS COULD PREDICTED THAT. OF FAR MORE LATINOS THE STATE. OF AFRICAN. AND A AGENT ISLANDERS OF THOSE ARE GROUPS THAT ARE GETTING IMPACTED EVEN MORE SO COULDN'T YOU MAKE THE CONNECTION THERE THAT OF. THIS MEDI CAL EXPANSION AS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN THE END DECIDED THE ROLL BACKS SHOULD HAVE INCLUDED- GROUPS LIKE THIS VULNERABLE GROUPS THAT ARE YOU COULD SEE THE NUMBER OF CASES AND THE NUMBER OF DEATHS ARE SO HIGH- DISPROPORTIONATELY TO THE REST OF THE POPULATION. SO I WOULD URGE RECONSIDER OBVIOUSLY ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE HAVE FOR MORE INFORMATION TODAY. THAN WE DID BACK IN JANUARY. AND IF THERE'S ANY COMMENTS ABOUT THEM. YES WILL SIMPLY SAY I'LL MAKE SURE TO TAKE THAT BACK ON THE CALL IN THE IN. AND YOU ARE THIS IS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND SO VERY COGNIZANT THAT AND DECISIONS THAT WE MAY I CAN ALWAYS CAN SAY WILL CHANGE IS NOT. A OUR GOAL WHEN I ALLERGY I KNOW YOU'RE ASKING. ASKED ABOUT ELIGIBILITY SHE FOR THE MEDICAL. WAS TO PRESERVE. WHAT WE- COLLUDED THE EXTENT. COME FROM DOCUMENTS TELLS TO AGE TWENTY SIX THAT WAS PASSED IN LAST MUCH ACTING SO WE KNOW THAT'S NOT UNITS KIND OF. WE HAVE AN. ON THE LINE- THE SECOND QUESTION IS- WHAT WAS THE CRITERIA USED TO DECIDE THE LIST OF CUTS. OR THE AREAS OF CUTTING UP AND I KNOW THERE WERE SEVERAL COMMENTS MADE PRIOR ESPECIALLY BY- DOCTOR PAN OF BUT WHAT DID YOU USE TO DECIDE. ITS POTENTIAL CUTS. YES SO WHEN IT CAME TO THOSE BASE CARDS ARE AND ALL ALMOST ALL OF WHICH ARE IN AT FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS TRIGGER THEY WERE DEAR REACHED YOU- PROGRAMS THAT STATE SO YOU KNOW K. TWELVE EDUCATION HIGHER EDUCATION YOU KNOW WHILE MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY SCHOOLS ARE. MEDI CAL OPTIONAL. WERE REDUCE OR ELIMINATED DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICE DAYS YEAH I JUST ASK PROGRAM SO THESE ARE THE COURTS IN THE CORE. HUMAN WELFARE FUNCTIONS OF GOVERNMENT AND NONE OF THOSE PROGRAMS IT'S GETTING HOT AND WHEN IT CAME TO THOSE CUTS. THERE WERE A COUPLE AREAS AND I KNOW THAT. WHERE THERE WERE A GEN TALK YOU KNOW FIRST. YOU CAN CALIFORNIANS. STATE WE A CLASS AND- BASIS JURORS HER I. HSN. THEIR RECESS CHRISTIAN. FOR THE SERVICE OUR AT WORK FOR. WHEN IT CAME TO SOME OF THESE ARE PRO AS MEDICARE FOUR X. WE ARE THE RATES FOR REDUCE IDEA NOT WORKS FINE DAY BY. FIFTY SIX AND THOSE AND SEND A CHECK GENERAL MEDI CAL GROSS AND THERE WAS ALSO. A METHODOLOGY THAT WE WANT TAX IN DECIDING DEVELOPMENTAL. SERVICES THAT'S SHOULD BE IN IN THE TRIGGER AND EITHER CALLING THE LINE. I NEED MORE DETAIL ON THAT WE TRY TO STAY AN APPROACH THAT WOULD MINIMIZE THE HARM KNOWING THAT THERE'S NO WAY TO ELIMINATE MINDS WHO ARE STATIONED. THIS WELL AGAIN I THINK THAT IF AT THE START. PRIORITY WORK THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS I THINK THE RESULTS COULD HAVE BEEN A DIFFERENT AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR GOVERNMENT. TO REALLY STAND UP AND HOLD UP HIGH THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN OUR STATE- AND JUST A- COUPLE MORE THINGS- WE DO HAVE WE STILL IT IN YOUR PROPOSED BUDGET WE STILL HAVE APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. IRV IS THAT IS THAT CORRECT THAT I READ IT RIGHT. SO DEAR ON DEBTS IT UNDER THE COURT IN A RAINY DAY FUND WHICH IS THE BIGGEST LEVEL OF RESEARCH WE ARE AT COMPOSING SPENDING SEVEN POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET YEAR SO AFTER THAT THEY WOULD BE AN ADDITIONAL. IRAQI POINT FOUR BILLION IN THAT ACCOUNT APPROXIMATELY AS WELL AS ANOTHER FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION IN THE SAFETY NET RESEARCH. OUR ON MULTI YEAR FORECAST DOES SHOW. RESEARCH IN ITS YEARS. SO WITH SO WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE POINT OF THE ELEVEN OR WHATEVER EIGHT ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN IN RESERVE WILL WORK CUTTING BACK UP POTENTIALLY COMING CUTTING BACK ESPECIALLY OF CUTTING BACK ON SUCH ESSENTIAL SERVICES FOR SUCH ESSENTIAL VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. YES THAT'S A THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION BECAUSE WE'RE SEEING THESE CUTS IN LIKE YOU MENTIONED IN ACROSS THE STATE IN COMMUNITIES RIGHT NOW THE THINKING HERE IS TWO FOLD NUMBER ONE. THERE IS A CONSTITUTIONAL PROHIBITION UNDER PROPOSITION TWO ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF RESEARCH THAT YOU CAN WITHDRAW FROM THE RAINY DAY SIGNS IN A GIVEN YEAR. BUT MORE THAN THAT I THINK THE SECOND POINT WHICH IS NO WE HOPE IS NOT THE CASE THAT WE'RE PROJECTING TO BE THE CASE IS THAT EVEN THOUGH WE ARE ALL HOPEFUL THAT THE NINETEEN AND THEN MAKE OVER THE NEXT YEAR WILL BE RESOLVED. MAXINE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE THE ECONOMIC EFFECTS BASS ARE GOING TO REVERBERATE IN TERMS OF THIS CRISIS PROJECTS FOR SEVERAL YEARS EVEN THREE OR FOUR YOU DOWN THE ROAD MAY NOT NECESSARY I SEE. ALL HERE. YEARS AGO SO BUDGET OF THE RESEARCH IN THE IN THE SKY YEAR THAT MAKES THINGS LITTLE BIT YOU AND THIS YEAR BUT IT MAKES THINGS LOT HARDER MAY THE COST WORSE THE NEXT YEAR IN THE AFTER THAT SO. WE WHILE WE ARE SIMPLY IT OUT THE BUDGET FOR THE COMING YEAR. OKAY AND WE CAN STRUCTURE DEFICITS ALRIGHT IN THE YEAR AFTER. WE DID WANT TO HAVE SOMETHING OF A LONG TERM OUTLOOK IN MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE MINIMIZING THE DAMAGE THAT WE MIGHT HAVE TO. FACE IN THOSE COMING YEARS. ACTIONS FOR OUR ECONOMY. YEAH YEAH AND I UNDERSTAND I MEAN I UNDERSTAND THAT POINT OF VIEW AGAIN. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO WILL NOT HAVE FOOD ON THE TABLE. PEOPLE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SURVIVE. AND THAT'S THE BALLOTS THAT'S THE PART OF THE BUDGET THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT WITH REGARDS TO STILL HAVE ENOUGH OF A RESERVE OF THAT SIZE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THE PEOPLE WHO WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SURVIVE. FRAN DEATHS. AND THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THE LAST ONE IS IT'S A VERY SPECIFIC- BUT- IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WERE TAKING UP AND TALKING ABOUT BEFORE. THE BEFORE THE WHOLE BIT. AND THAT IS ABOUT THE FUNDING FORMULA FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION- I REPRESENT. UP MY DISTRICT IN MY DISTRICT. THE HIGHEST OF ALL. WITH REGARDS TO SPECIAL ED STUDENTS IN THE LA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND LA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IS IMPACTED OF VERY HARSHLY UP BY THE WAY THE ALLOCATION IS MADE SO I JUST WANT TO BRING IT TO YOUR ATTENTION I THINK THIS CONTINUES TO BE. UP A DISPROPORTIONATE OF FINANCIAL RISK DISABILITY ON THE SCHOOL DISTRICT ESPECIALLY AT A TIME WHEN THEY'RE NOW GOING TO HAVE TO. ADDRESS ALL THE ADDITIONAL EXPENSES- YOU KNOW TO TAKE CARE OF THE STATE'S CHILDREN AND THE YOUTH AND THE AND THE STUDENTS SO I WANT TO BRING THAT. TAKE IT TO YOUR ATTENTION. THAT'S IT MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER CABALLERO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND ONE I THINK. THANK THE- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOR YOUR YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY IT REALLY APPRECIATE THE THOUGHTFULNESS THAT'S GONE INTO THIS BUDGET. IT'S NEVER EASY TO MAKE BUDGET CUTS ON THE TO SAY THAT AND- OR IN A TOUGH FISCAL ENVIRONMENT NOW HAVING SAID THAT I DO WANNA SECOND. A COUPLE OF COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BY OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS IN REGARDS TO THE- PRESSURE FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND IN PARTICULAR THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE THE SMALLER COMMUNITIES THAT ARE NOT GETTING A DIRECT GRANT UNDER THE CARES PROGRAM AS WELL AS A SMALL RURAL HOSPITALS I HAVE A- AND NUMBER EIGHT IN MY- DISTRICT THAT MAY NOT. CONTINUE TO EXIST THIS. BECAUSE AND IT WOULD BE A SHAME FOR US TO LOSE THOSE HOSPITALS- THEY'VE DONE ALL THE RIGHT THINGS BY PREPARING FOR THE SEARCH THAT DIDN'T COME THANK GOODNESS WE DID THE RIGHT THING. BUT BUT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN DOING THEIR LIFE BLOODS WORK WHICH IS THE ELECTIVE SURGERY SO I JUST WANT TO PUT THAT IS A PEN BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE- WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA HAVE TO COME BACK TO THAT AT SOME SOME POINT AND HAVE A DISCUSSION. BUT IN REGARDS TO I'M I'M CONCERNED ABOUT- WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS AND PART OF THE REASON MAY BE THAT WE'RE JUST NOT HEARING BACK FROM OUR LOCAL- REP. IT IS ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING WITH THE RESOURCES THAT HAVE BEEN GRANTED TO THEM AND ON MANY OF US LOOK AROUND AND AS MUCH AS WERE NOT OUT WE STILL WHEN WE WHEN WE DO TRAVEL WE SEE THIS. NUMBER OF HOMELESS PEOPLE ON THE STREET AND SO. I'M WONDERING IF YOU COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. HOW YOU BELIEVE PROPOSED BUDGET WILL HELP THE STATE TO CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS TO COMBAT HOMELESSNESS AND IN PARTICULAR. HOW THE BUDGET PLANS TO PRESERVE THE GAINS MADE OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS IN THE KEEP IN THE HOUSE PROGRAM. HOW DOES IT WORK TOGETHER. YES ON THE ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS- WHICH ARE AS THE GOVERNOR AND I STAYED IN A STATE OF THE STATE OURS IS THE TOP PRIORITY FOR THE STATE. IN WHICH YOU TALKED ABOUT IN THE CITY'S DRESS THE FACT OF THE KOBE NINETEEN GEN X. HASN'T LESSEN THE URGENCY DEALING WITH THAT AND IN FACT. THERE'S AN EVEN STRONGER PUBLIC HEALTH COMPONENT AS WELL AS ALL THE OTHER MORAL ETHICAL AND PRACTICAL REASONS I TO GET HE- AN JURISDICTIONS. I ON RESOURCES REDUCE. I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER TO TWO OF MY COLLEAGUES TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE SPECIFIC THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING FIRST KRISTIN SHELTER AND WILL COVER THE SPECIFIC FEDERAL ALLOCATIONS. BECAUSE A LARGE. PART OF THE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR SEATS WILL BE DEVOTED SEC REDUCING HOMELESSNESS AND PROVIDING SUPPORT. LOW MY CAR CHRIS. HELLO ALL. MY TO DETAIL ABOUT HOW THIS IS BEING ADDRESSED IN THE CONTEXT THE OVERALL. THIS IS CHRISTIAN FRIEND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SORRY ABOUT THAT AND HAD A LITTLE AND MUTING CHALLENGE AND BE CORONAVIRUS REALLY FUN AS WE NOTED HAS TREMENDOUS FLEXIBILITY AND WE HAVE. ALLOCATE CENTERS. ALMOST POPULATION. WE HAVE AND SIX HUNDRED MILLION IN ADDITIONAL FUNDING TOWARDS HOMELESSNESS AND IN IN THE BUDGET THAT IS SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO FOLLOW ON ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE HUNDRED MILLION PROVIDED PREVIOUSLY FOR PRICE FROM G. AND THEN WE HAVE FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS- TO CITIES. THAT WOULD BE FOR BOTH PUBLIC SAFETY AND HOMELESSNESS AND IN TERMS OF PRIORITIZE PRAYERS HOUSING BILLS EXPENDITURES RELATIVE TO THE SPECIFIC POPULATION AND I WOULD. TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE CHRIS. I TO TALK MORE REGARDING TO PROGRAM AREAS GOOD AFTERNOON CRISCO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT THANK YOU FOR THE QUICK QUESTION CENTER- WITH REGARDS TO HOMELESSNESS- AS YOU MAY KNOW AND AS NOTED EARLIER- PROJECT ROOM KEY WORDS- WAS BORN WITH- THE INITIAL HUNDRED AND FIFTY- PROVIDED IN THE CURRENT YEAR WHICH PROVIDED- SHORT TERM HOUSING FOR A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS WHO EITHER ACT REYES OR- OR- EXITING I'M SYMPTOMS ARE A- CO IN NINETEEN- FOR THOSE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND SO. IN ORDER TO AVOID THE CLIFF A FACT NO LONGER BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT HOUSING FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS- THE BUDGET AS SOON. PROPOSES TO USE. A HUNDRED OR SO HUNDRED AND FIFTY OF WHICH A HUNDRED FIFTY WOULD BACK FILL. THE GENERAL FUND PROVIDED IN THE CURRENT YEAR WHAT THE REMAINING SIX HUNDRED MILLION- TO BLEND IN RATE WITH THE LOCALS DOLLARS THAT THEY'RE RECEIVING. EITHER BY WAY OF. THERE ALLOCATION OF THE SIERRA FINDS. SOME OF THEIR OTHER DIRECT ALLOCATIONS OF THE FEDERAL FUNDING THAT THEY'VE RECEIVED AND IN ADDITION TO THE KEEP IT HAPPENS THAT YOU MAY HAVE INDICATED. IN YOUR EARLIER COMMENT BUT PULLING TOGETHER AND BRINGING A LOT OF THOSE- THOSE FUNDING FROM THE LOCALS IN ADDITION TO THE SIX HUNDRED MILLION TO- SHE'S ME TO PROVIDE THE ACQUISITION FOR THESE PROJECT ROOM G. SITES. AND SO THE LONG TERM GOAL IS TO ACQUIRE THESE FACILITY AT. WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND DEPARTMENT OF- GENERAL SERVICES IN ADDITION TO THE LOCALS. AND HAVE THOSE- LOCALS OPERATE THOSE PROJECT ROOM KEY SITES- INTO THE FUTURE MOVING FORWARD. SO HAVING SAID THAT I APPRECIATE THE RESPONSE BUT HAVING SAID THAT- THOSE FUNDS NEED TO BE USED BY THE END OF THE CALENDAR YEAR AND MY CONCERN IS THE ABILITY TO PURCHASE. ANYTHING WITHIN A SIX MONTH PERIOD AND HAVE IT BE DONE BECAUSE FEDERAL FUNDS NEED TO BE USED WITHIN THAT PERIOD OF TIME- SO IT IT PRESUMES THAT WE'VE GOT SOME SITES IDENTIFIED AT LEAST IDENTIFIED WHERE WE CAN. START THE NEGOTIATIONS OTHERWISE WE HAVE A WHOLE HECK OF A LOT OF HOUSING MONEY THAT HAS TO BE RETURNED TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AM I CORRECT. THAT'S THAT'S CORRECT FOR THE SIERRA FUNDS THEY DO HAVE TO BE FULLY SPENT ARE THOSE FUNDS HAVE TO BE SPENT BY DECEMBER THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY BUT THERE IS SOME MONEY THAT HAS A LITTLE BIT LONGER FLEXIBILITY AND THAT'S THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING PROVIDED DOES TO GRANT SOURCES- THROUGH THE CARE EXACTLY THAT WE'RE PROVIDING A LONGER DURATION OF TIME AND THOSE ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY TWO. I'M AT SO THERE WAS THOSE PARTS OF PLANS OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY AND THEN IN ADDITION AS YOU NOTED THAT HE'D BEEN HAPPENS DO YOU HAVE. AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME- TO BE USED BY LOCALS BUT THAT IS GOING TO BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION WITH THE LOCALS IS THERE THEIR ABILITY. TO PROVIDE THE LONG TERM FUNDING TO SUSTAIN THE SITES A LONG TERM. I WILL ALSO NOTE HERE. HERE COME IN ABOUT THE TIME SENSITIVITY AS WELL- WHEN WE WERE- ACQUIRING OR IDENTIFYING THE SITES FOR PROJECT ROOM G. OUR INTENTION THE STATE'S INTENTION TO PURCHASE THESE FACILITIES LONG TERM WAS ALWAYS MADE. KNOWN MANY OF THEM HAVE BUILT IN PROVISIONS IN THEIR LEASE AGREEMENTS THAT THE STATE WILL BE LOOKING TO. THE SIDE. AND THE- PEACE AND SO DOES COME STATIONS HAVE ALREADY BEGUN THAT'S THE IN. OF THE ADMIN. IS TO BUILD UPON. THE A LOT OF THAT WORK ON THIS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS ALREADY BEGUN WITH THOSE- PROPERTY OWNERS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. TO CONTINUE TO PROCEED WITH THE ACQUISITION. OF THOSE SITES IF THEY ARE- DECIDED TO BE THE ONES THAT- THE STATE WOULD LIKE TO- PURCHASE. GREAT OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THAT THAT'S THAT'S REALLY HELPFUL. SO MOVING ON TO A DIFFERENT TOPIC AND THIS ONE IS THE- THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT- LET ME JUST SAY ON ON THE HOUSING I'M VERY PLEASED TO SEE THAT WE HAVE A NEW DIRECTOR MAKES CD AS WELL AS THE POSITION FOR BCS EIGHT FELT BECAUSE- SEEMS TO ME YOU CAN SAY IT'S A PRIORITY BUT YOU. IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANYBODY. THERE PERMANENTLY IT'S HARD TO SEE HOW THEY'LL BE INNOVATIVE AND- BE ABLE TO MOVE THE AGENDA FORWARD. BUT MOVING TO THE DBA THE- OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT- I WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED TO SEE THEIR RECOMMENDATION IN THE MAY REVISE THAT- THE NEW EXPANDED AUTHORITY. OVER CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTIONS WAS WAS STILL IN THE BUDGET THIS IS THIS GUY I THINK GOES BACK. TO SOMETHING THAT SENATOR DRAWS A WAS. WAS COMMENTING ON THIS IS- FORTY FOUR POINT THREE MILLION DOLLAR. EXPENDITURE TO EXPAND THE- THE WORKLOAD AND THAT AND THEM. THE HORIZON OF THINGS THAT COULD BE. THE BATTLE FOR WHICH OVER SAY COULD BE GRANTED. AND WE STILL DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE EXPANSION WILL LOOK LIKE AND I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD TELL ME THE RATIONALE BEHIND THE ADMINISTRATION'S MAINTENANCE OF THIS REORGANIZATION PROPOSAL- WHEN WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF FIGHTING AN ACTIVE PANDEMIC AND WE'VE GOT SOME REALLY SIGNIFICANT- SOCIAL SERVICE NEEDS AT THE SAME TIME. YES I WILL MAKE TWO BRIEF POINTS ON THAT AND THEN I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES HELLO WHEN WE TO SOME OF THE SONGS. I THINK THE FIRST POINT IS. THIS PROPOSAL WAS INCLUDED IN THE NAY OR NATION RECOGNIZING THAT ESPECIALLY GIVEN APPLICATION AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL ON CONSUMER PROTECTION IS AN URGENT NEED AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE ESPECIALLY IN THE MIDST OF THAT. PUBLIC NINETEEN CAN DOWN NAY- WHEN THERE IS EXPLOITATION OF CONSUMERS CALLING ON THAT THE STATE HAS THE APPROPRIATE POWERS CRITICS CONSUMERS DOT ON ITS OWN IS AN INADEQUATE ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION BECAUSE WE'RE PROTECTION IS IMPORTANT BUT AS YOU MENTIONED HOMELESSNESS IS IMPORTANT. HEALTH CARE AND- SOCIAL SERVICES THAT SENATOR ALSO MENTIONS ARE ALSO IMPORTANT TO MORE CONCRETELY ON THIS ISSUE THE SECOND POINT I WOULD MAKE IS. THAT FUNDING THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO IT ACTUALLY COMING OUT ITS SELF. IT'S NOT. TIME MINOR SYSTEM WHEN IT'S- ON IT CAN YEARS THIS IS WHY. BUT I WILL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE CLAIMS TALK ABOUT A LITTLE MORE. REPEAT THE NAME AGAIN OR THE PERSON ON THE PHONE. YES SO IT'S CLICK CALLUM C. L. I. N. C. A. HE'S ON THE PHONE I'M SORRY. CLINT THANK YOU YES. HELLO. YES WE CAN HEAR YOU HEAR ME YES GO AHEAD OKAY COMPOUND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO- THINK BUT ABOVE EIGHT LAID OUT- THE REASONS FOR WHY NOW ON THIS PROPOSAL- BEING THAT THE NEEDS ARE HIGHER IN THE- ATTORNEY AND FINANCIAL RECESSION AND THAT IT IS SPECIAL FUNDS- THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WE HAVE IT HAD BEEN AVAILABLE SINCE JANUARY AND I KNOW THAT NAM XO DOWN OUR ABILITY TO HAVE. SOME CA. LAST AMONG OR SO BUT ANY REVISION OF INCLUDED LANGUAGE THAT ALLOW MAKES A BUDGET- TIED ON- TO LEGISLATION TO BE PASSED LATER IN THE SPRING IF YOU ALLOW FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION AND WE JUST OTHERS DID UPDATED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE ON FRIDAY TAKING IT BACK FROM EVERYONE- THAT WE THINK REALLY DOESN'T. MOVE AWAY FROM THE CORE PRINCIPLE OF OUR ORIGINAL PROPOSAL BUT REALLY CLARIFY. WITH THE LANGUAGE. SOME OF THE CONFUSION ALL WHERE. IF THE OTHER TO LIGHT EITHER ACT WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THEIR LICENSE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE IMPACTED BY THIS PROPOSAL- WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS CLEAR THAT WE'RE NOT ESTABLISHING YOU LICENSES- FINANCIAL SERVICE OF LICENSES WITH THE PROGRAM. IF YOU'RE ON LIFE AND TING YOUR FINANCIAL RISK PRODUCT PROVIDERS NEW. REGISTRANTS BUT THAT IT MIGHT CATEGORY I'M AND JUST WORKING SOME OF THOSE WELL TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S CLEAR AND THAT UNFAIR AND ABUSE OF THE DECEPTIVE PRACTICES- AUTHORITY WOULD APPLY TO YOU REGISTERED. AND THE WIFE AND SO I THERE'S SOME OF AND USE CASH AND WE- OF COURSE OUR CALLS ON. AND WE CAN. HOPEFULLY WORK THROUGH THE WITH THE LEAD. OVER THE COMING. ONE FOLLOW UP ON THAT- DIRECTOR OF THIS ONE OFTEN IS. BOB THIS IS ONE OF THOSE SPECIAL FUNDS FOR WHICH THE MONEY CAN ONLY BE USED FOR THAT PURPOSE UNLESS IT CAN BE BORROWED- AND PAID BACK I'M ASSUMING. YES AND SO I DID WANT TO CHECK- WITH SOME OF OUR STAFF ON THIS SPECIFIC RESTRICTIONS ON THE SPECIAL FUNDS BUT IT IS DIRECTED FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE THAT'S CORRECT. OKAY AND THEN MOVE ON TO- UP THAT MY LAST QUESTION IT IN HAS TO DO WITH THE E. CIGARETTE TAX. AND I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD. YOU COULD TELL US WHAT THE ESTIMATED REVENUE FROM THAT PROPOSED E. E. CIGARETTE TAX. IS AND IF. THE ESTIMATE CHANGES GIVEN THE NEW FEDERAL FDA BAN ON CERTAIN FLAVORS- AND WHETHER THAT WAS PARTY YOUR CALCULATION- AND THEN AND THEN AS PART OF THAT DISCUSSION TALK ABOUT WHY YOU BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE. IT SHOULD GO INTO A NEW SPECIAL FIND IS SUPPOSED TO BE BEING DEPOSITED IN THE GENERAL FUND. YES ON THE E. CIGARETTE TAX- I HAVE TO COLLEAGUES ON THE LINE WHO CAN SPEAK TO BOTH OF THOSE QUESTIONS- FIRST DAYS RYAN MILLER- FROM HHS. UNIT AND FINANCES AND SECOND ON THEIR READING YOU ACT QUESTION THAT YOU DISCUSSED WE ALSO HAVE JAKE CHAMBER WHEN ON THE SIGN WHICH READ IT OVER TO BOTH. WE'RE GOING TO A OF BRIAN MILLER FIRST I BELIEVE IS ON A VIDEO CONFERENCE. HI THIS IS RYAN MILLER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I HEARD YOUR SECOND QUESTION SENATOR- CONCERNING THE GENERAL FUND COULD YOU PLEASE REPEAT YOUR FIRST QUESTION. YES THE FIRST QUESTION HAD TO DO WITH THE- THE REVENUE PROJECTIONS FOR THE PROPOSED CIGARETTE TAX AND WHETHER THE ESTIMATE THAT YOU YOU HAVE CHANGES GIVEN THE NEW FEDERAL FTA BAN ON ON FLAVORS. ON CERTAIN FLAVORS AND WE ALSO HAVE A SENATE BILL THAT AT THAT HAS A SIMILAR. KIND OF LIMITATION AND I WONDER IF THE ESTIMATE CHANGES GIVEN THAT. THAT INFORMATION. OKAY SO YEAH I WOULD PROBABLY- GOOD FOR OF THOSE QUESTIONS TO J. CHAMBERLAIN I THINK I WOULD SAY- CONCERNING THE USE OF THE PHONES- THE GOVERNOR AND I HAD TO KEEP PRIORITIES AND THEY CONTINUE RE BUDGET- TO- USE THE FUNDING TO BOTH OF MINISTER THAT TAX AND GET SOME OF THE FUNDING THE CHP- AND THEN IN THE MAYOR VISION OF COURSE ARE PROPOSING TO USE ME ON ALLOCATED AMOUNTS TO OFFSET GENERAL COSTS IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. AND SO DEPENDING ON YOUR CHAMBER WAS RESPONSE I TO THE EXTENT THAT THE REVENUES WOULD BE LOWER I THINK THAT THAT WOULD PROBABLY READ THE AMOUNT OF SET. CAL I WOULD KICK IT TO JAY. FOR TEETH ABOUT HER MISTER. YEAH GOOD AFTERNOON JERRY CHAMBERLAIN- DEPARTMENT FIND SO THE MATTER REVENUE WE'VE ESTIMATED. DR FROM THIS THE NEW TAX WOULD BE A THIRTY THREE MILLION IN. TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE FISCAL YEAR- AND WHETHER THAT WOULD BE- FOR THAT WOULD BE RE SHOULD BE REDUCED BY THE FEDERAL ACTIONS ON- FLAVORED CIGARETTES ALL I HAVE TO BACK TO ON THE- RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. APPRECIATE THAT SHE THAT. COLLEAGUES THAT NEXT UP WE HAVE CENTER MORE LOCKS INTO MORE LOCK WILL BE FOLLOWED BY SENATORS STERN SKINNER AND THEN LABOR ARE THERE OTHER MEMBERS WHO WISH TO SPEAK. THEN IT SENATOR DOLLY I SEE YOU WHICH- SO THERE'S OKAY SENATOR MORE LAW. QUESTION THEN YOU GO IN QUESTIONS FOR MS VESSEL OF THE THAT THE COULD ANSWER TWO A FEW THE FIRST ONE IS- MISTER RESPONDED BEEN I ASK THIS QUESTION LAST YEAR IT'S MAY EIGHTEENTH WHERE IS THE STATE'S COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT FOR JUNE THIRTIETH. THIS IS. TWENTY NINETEEN. AND SO ON THAT ACCOUNT FOR I WOULD HAVE TO CHECK WITH OUR OFFICE AND ALSO WHAT THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE WILL MAKE A NOTE TO CHECK IN ON THAT WOULD BE GREAT WERE ONE OF THREE STATES THAT STILL HAVEN'T FINISHED THEIR KAFIRS NUMBER TWO YOU SAID AT THE BEGINNING ONCE IN A CENTURY- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IS THAT JUST A DESCRIPTOR OR ARE YOU ANTICIPATING A SHORT. CLIP IN THE ECONOMY OR- JUST CURIOUS IN A COUPLE WORDS WHAT THAT MEANT SURE JUST TO KEEP IT BRIEF FIVE DEFINITELY NOT TREATING THIS AS A BLACK AND I THINK WHAT'S AROUND YOU PROJECTIONS NOT ONLY THE FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR GAP FOR THIS EVENING BUDGET BANKS THE STRUCTURAL ABSENT WE NEED. IN THE COMING YEARS THIS IS AN ECONOMIC CRISIS I THINK WHEN I REFER TO ONCE IN A CENTURY TO IN TWO WAYS ANY NUMBER ONE. THE FACT THAT THIS IS. BY I KNOW WHAT IT'S PEOPLE MAY THE ANALOGY. NINETEEN EIGHTEEN IN THE EARLY PART OF THE TWENTY CENTURY THAT WAS EXACTLY THE SAME AGO AND THE SECOND THING I THINK IS DOUBLE SEE HOW THE ROAD TO RECOVERY IS BUT THESE LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT HAVE NOT BEEN SEEN WELL OVER HALF A CENTURY YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE TIME OF THE GREAT QUESTION FOR EXAMPLE IN THE GREAT RECESSION TEN YEARS AGO WITH JUST. AS MANY OF YOU MENTIONED YOU WERE. YOUR RESEARCH OTHER ELECTED OFFICIAL. THAT WAS A- ECONOMIC. AND EVEN. WE SAW. LEVELS HE HAD A LITTLE BIT OVER. PERCENT IN THIS FIRST. WORSENING UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS THAT WILL EXCEED AYE AYE SEVERAL. SO WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING THE ECONOMY OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS IMPROVE AND SO WE'VE BEEN ABLE THROUGH OUR PROP NINETY EIGHT TO GIVE MORE MONEY TO OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. BUT AT THE SAME TIME THERE CAL STIRS CONTRIBUTIONS HAVE BEEN RISING SO THEY REALLY. AT THE END OF THE DAY THEIR DELTA RATHER. THIS ONE OF THE BIGGEST. ECONOMIC RECESSIONS DEPRESSIONS IN IN A CENTURY IS IN THIS TIME TO DO SOME. IMPROVEMENTS TO SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS AT THE STATE LIKE THE PENSION PLANS. COULD WE DO A BIKE A DIFF ASSURED RISK PLAN AT THE STATE OF WISCONSIN. HAS IMPLEMENTED AND THEY ALWAYS SHOW UP AS BEING A HISTORICALLY FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS WHEN THE PEW REPORT COMES OUT EVERY YEAR IS THIS AN OPPORTUNITY NOW TO SAY HEY. LET'S AVOID FURTHER PROBLEMS BECAUSE A YEAR OR TWO OR THREE OR FOUR FROM NOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A MUCH LARGER PENSION PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS HOW DO WE- WHEN WE ARE DOING. NOW WHAT KIND OF COVERAGE IN IN. TWENTY TWELVE. SAID THE BUDGET AND THE NEW REVISION AT AND DID NOT INCLUDE ANY OF THIS SPECIFIC TYPES OF CHANGES. THAT YOU MENTION. THAT BEING SAID WE ARE AWARE OF THE- PRESSURES THAT. UNDER AND NOT JUST THE STATE BUT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE WHEN IT COMES TO SOME OF THESE RISING COSTS AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY. FOR SCHOOLS WE NOT ONLY ALLOCATED FOR BILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDING FOR K. TWELVE SCHOOLS FOR THE UPCOMING YEAR. ALSO INCLUDED AND REALLOCATING SUPPLEMENTARY MONEY THAT THE GOVERNOR. WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE HAS TAKEN OUT OF THE SURPLUS LAST YEAR. HE'S THAT BY. SOME OF THE SCHOOLS IN CONTRIBUTION. IN THE NEXT YEAR AND THE YEAR AFTER THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT. THIS IS AN ISSUE THESE COSTS THAT HIGH SCHOOLS WILL BE DEALING WITH FOR SOME TIME TO COME AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES. CAN WE- NEGOTIATE AND MODIFY RETIREE MEDICAL PLANS. SO I THINK ALL I CAN SAY RIGHT NOW IS THAT THOSE CONSIDERATIONS ARE NOT DIRECTLY PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S. RACE HIGH SPEED RAIL. SO WHEN IT COMES TO HIGH SPEED RAIL AT THE GOVERNOR I HAD SENT OUT HIS PLANS RECOGNIZING SOME THE ISSUES WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL AT THE BEGINNING OF HIS ADMINISTRATION LAST YEAR. THAT FUNDING FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL COMES FROM A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SORTS CITY COUNCIL FEDERAL FUNDS IT COMES FROM BONDS THAT WERE APPROVED BY THE VOTERS YEARS AGO AND IT COMES FROM CONTINUOUS PREPARATION FROM THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AND WHEN IT COMES TO THAT LAST EL NAY. AS THE DISCUSSION WITH GENERAL POLICY. THE CAP. AND TRADE PROGRAM I READ THE NEWS. ACTED OR LOOKS LIKE THEY WILL. FALL IN THE COMING YEAR SO ALL OF THE- THAT ARE. BY A FOR. WE'LL SEE REDUCE RECORD. AND THEN THE CAP AND TRADE MONEY COULD AND SO OF GOING TO HIGH SPEED RAIL TO GO HARDING ASSETS. A SO THAT WE CAN REDUCE WILDFIRES A PATCH OF TO A COMMENT- WHAT ABOUT- IMHO USE WORK WE'RE SHOWING SIX HUNDRED FOUR MILLION- IN MORE STATE EMPLOYEE PAY AND BENEFIT RAISES. WILL THOSE BE RENEGOTIATED OR OR MAYBE PUT ON HOLD. SO ONLY ONE COMMENTS HERE AND MY COLLEAGUE MARY HALTER MANIA IS ON THE LINE AS WELL. THE BUDGET REFLECTS OUR- EMPLOYEES SAVINGS SIDES I BELIEVE TEN PERCENT. OF EMPLOYEES SAVINGS ACROSS OUR STATE EMPLOYEES ON AND RESPECTING THE LOS GATOS AFTER BARGAINING TABLE TO ACHIEVE THOSE SAVINGS WELL TURN IT OVER TO AND IT ALSO MEANS AND THAT'S THAT'S OKAY THAT. THAT'S FINE I WANT TO KEEP THIS REAL BRIEF ABOUT THE- MINIMUM WAGE WE'RE DOING THAT EVERY YEAR. AS AN INCREASE IN THAT AFFECTS AYE HSS WHO WE WILL BE PUT THAT. MAYBE A TEMPORARY HOLDER. OUGHT TO BE DOING WITH THE MINIMUM WAGE. RIGHT NOW THE BUDGET WRESTLING A SCHEDULE INCREASE IN THE MINIMUM WAGE. YEAR SO OF THE PRO. MY COMMISSION I HSS ARE CONSTANT AREAS THAT ARE PRETTY SIGNIFICANT. BUT THAT DALY REVISION WHAT'S CLASSES SCHEDULED INCREASE. RATES OF MATT THE FISCAL CRISIS MANAGEMENT AND ASSISTANCE TEAM- YOU HISTORICALLY FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE HAVING TROUBLE WOULD TO LOAN MONEY. BUT WE'VE ALREADY MENTIONED LAUSD- THEY HAVE AN UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICIT OF ALMOST TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS IF THE BARD HALF OF THAT WE'RE WITH. THE STATE BE ABLE TO LOAN BILLION DOLLARS. TO LA UNIFIED. I TO CHECK BACK ON SPECIFIC ISSUE TO FOLLOW WITH YOU. WORK WORK. AT BUDGETING TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR A BI FIVE ENFORCEMENT I'M WONDERING WHAT'S THE GOAL THERE ARE WE TRYING TO PENALIZE TAX PREPARERS OR- OR OR REPAIR IS THAT A REVENUE SOURCE AND THAT SEEMS ANTI BUSINESS HOW DOES. HOW DOES GO BIZ FEEL ABOUT THIS BUDGET ALLOCATION. SO I HAVEN'T CHECKED WITH DOLBY SPECIFICALLY I THINK ACTION ARE ONLY- THAT GOVERNOR YOUR CHECKED IN WITH ALL THE MEMBERS OF THIS ADMINISTRATION. I SEE PUT TOGETHER THE BUDGET AND WE HERE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE COURTING HIM SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT ALLOCATION FOR EIGHTY FIVE ENFORCEMENT. THAT WAS A BILL THAT WAS ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR AND SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR I CITIES ARE RESOURCES TO ENFORCE MISS VAUGHN IS ALREADY. AND THEN LAST QUESTION ONE IN PEOPLE AND CAL SHOULD PLAY OUT OR ON A COLLECTING. BENEFITS THAT'S IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR DO WE KNOW HOW MANY ARE UNEMPLOYED IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND WHAT IT WHAT TO ME DISSIPATE. I HAVE NOT SEEN DIRECT WAY OFF DATA. OR UNEMPLOYMENT DATA WHEN IT COMES TO THAT PUBLIC SECTOR CERTAINLY THE REPORTS THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING ACROSS THE NATION. I CHAU ALREADY THAT DIFFERENT. THINGS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY ARE BEGINNING TO KAT I THINK AS WE SINCE HEARING A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE LOOKING. TO CONGRESS TO SEE WHAT KIND OF A- GROUP BECAUSE- IT CALMLY. CONFER WITH ADDITIONAL AID I THINK YOU'LL LIKELY SEE DIFFERENT MY OFFICE- ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO SPECIFIC DATA AND WHAT THAT LEVEL WAYS I DON'T. MR BUT EVAN I OF YOUR TO RESPONSES YOUR PROFESSIONALISM THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. AND THANK YOU SIR SENATOR STERN EURO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IS WORKING. IT CERTAINLY IS OKAY- WELL THANK YOU- MR THIS ONE DOWN AND TWO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOR WRESTLING WITH- PRETTY IMPOSSIBLE CIRCUMSTANCE HERE I APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY THUS FAR. MY QUESTION HAD TO DO WITH. OPERATIONS FOR CENTRAL DISASTERS WE'RE GONNA BE FACING- THIS FALL INTO THE WINTER I KNOW WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE WILD FIRES YOU BUT- OUR CLIMATE COSTS WE KNOW WERE ARE BIGGER THAN JUST WILD FIRE WERE WE'RE FACING A MEGA DROUGHT THIS YEAR- AND A NUMBER OF OTHER- CONCERNING IT SHOES THAT. I'M WORRIED ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO SORT OF FIGHT CO TO COVER OUR ECONOMY- AND- BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO THESE DISASTERS AT THE SAME TIME SO I'M JUST CURIOUS TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS FIRST ON SORT OF RESPONSE CAPABILITIES AND THEN. COROLLARY QUESTION ON OUR ABILITY TO PREVENT KIND OF DISASTERS- BUT ON THE RESPONSE I. AT I THINK. SO ESTIMATE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS WE'VE HAD I DON'T KNOW WHERE FIVE JUST SIX BILLION DOLLAR COSTS EMERGE WHEN WE HAVE MASSIVE CATASTROPHIC FIRES SO HOW DO WE GET THROUGH- THAT KIND OF SCENARIO THIS YEAR UNDER THE CURRENT BUDGET. YES SO WHEN IT COMES TO THAT ISSUE AND I THINK IT'S EXACTLY YOU MENTIONED I THINK WHAT WOULD REALLY BE A DIFFICULT SCENARIO AS DIFFICULT AS A STEREO IS NOT WORKING RIGHT NOW. IS IF THIS CRISIS WE WERE WE ARE IN WERE COMPOUNDED BY SOME OTHER TYPE OF DISASTER WHETHER IT'S ANOTHER WILDFIRE WHETHER IT'S AN EARTHQUAKE OR ANY OTHER. SO I KNOW WE WERE TALKING BEFORE ABOUT HOW MOST OF THE- CREATE A NEW INVESTMENTS OF THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED IN JANUARY. I HAVEN'T REALLY WHAT'S WRONG I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THESE AREAS WHERE WHEN IT COMES TO. FIRE FIRE FIREFIGHTERS STAFFING WHEN IT COMES TO RESOURCES FOR CAL- YES RESPOND TO THE RANGE OF DISASTERS AND WHEN IT COMES TO. THE ACT UNITY TOWER. THIS IS THE DEAL WITH SOME OF THE SHOTS THAT WERE SO DESTRUCTIVE. LAST YEAR IN MAKING SURE THAT THE STATE AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS I'M RESOURCES THERE WE ARE CONTINUING TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN THESE AREAS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE WELL EQUIPPED FOR WHATEVER. I DO APPRECIATE THAT I KNOW. I MEAN I MISSED IT YOU'RE ALSO RELYING ON SOME KIND OF. CONTINGENCY GIVEN THAT EVEN FROM WHAT YOU'VE BUDGET AND BEEN VERY PROACTIVE ABOUT- AUGMENTING DESPITE ALL THE OTHER CUTS. THE COST WOULD STILL- ARE. FAR EXCEEDED. SO WHAT YOU NEED AND BUDGET FOR RIGHT IN TERMS OF YES AND CAL FIRE FUNDS IS THAT YOU'RE ANTICIPATING SOME SORT OF FEDERAL. AID TO COMMENT AS WELL IF WE HAD A STATE MASSIVE EARTHQUAKE OR WILD FIRE OR- FLOOD. YES GENERALLY WHEN IT COMES THESE COSTS AND NOW- TURN OVER BRIEFLY TO MY COLLEAGUES IN THE RESOURCES AND CAPITAL OUTLAY ROOM WHICH RECENT CALVERT ANOTHER COLLEAGUES. CALIFORNIA THE STATE NEEDS TO HAVE THE RESOURCES TO MOUNT THE IMMEDIATE RESPONSE AND THEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HELPS WHAT HAPPENED NEXT YEAR MINUS SO SEATED AGENCIES AT. ALL LEVELS. IT WILL ROLL AND- TO SEE FOR A LOT OF THESE EXPLAINS EVEN WHEN WE ALSO REALLY RECEIVE REIMBURSEMENT OF THE STATE AUSTIN HOUSE FRONT MOST OR EVEN ALL OF THEM AND REIMBURSEMENT CAN TAKE MONTHS IF NOT YEARS SO THAT BECOMES MORE CASH FLOW MANAGEMENT PROBLEM AND WE CERTAINLY HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW. BUT IT'S HARD TO ESTIMATE IN ADVANCE JUST HOW MUCH THE COST WILL BE BECAUSE THAT DEPENDS BOTH ON THE SCALE OF THE DISASTER WHAT TIME TODAY'S AS WELL AS HOW COOPERATE AT OUR PARTNERS. WILL BE LET ME TURN IT OVER VERY BRIEFLY ASK MY COLLEAGUES IN THE RESOURCE ROOM MY CHAD. ANY ADDITIONAL DETAIL. THANKS AS CURRENCY BUT WORTH FINDING YET SO THANK NORMAL QUITE OTHER YEAR. BUDGET WE AN EMERGENCY FUND APPROPRIATION THAT HELPS US TO ADDRESS WHILE FIRED- COSTS THAT GO BEYOND THE KIND REGULAR BASED BUDGET AMOUNTS IN ADDITION AS A MY COLLEAGUE REFERENCED WHATEVER WE HAVE MAJOR DISASTERS IF THE PRESIDENT DECLARES A PRESIDENTIAL DISASTER. AND HE WAS PUBLIC ASSISTANCE FUNDING BECOMES AVAILABLE- FIRST TAPPED INTO THEIR SO WHAT IT REALLY DOES GET DOWN TO THE MAGNITUDE OF THE DISASTER. HAVE THEY WORKS FINE CORPORATE AS WELL- AS ARE JUST RESPONSE ROUTES JOB RATIONS ACCOUNT. MECHANISM THAT WE USED TO ADDRESS THOSE DISASTERS. AND IF I COULD MANAGER JUST MIGHT. MY FOLLOW TO ON THE PREVENTION SIDE- I I'VE SEEN REFERENCE IN SOME OF THE DOCUMENTS THAT- LIKE JUSTIFYING FOR INSTANCE THAT CORRECTED A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR CUT- TO THE HOME HARDENING FUNDS- DAD'S- INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS. TO IMPROVE THE RESILIENCE OF VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES WILL BE CONSIDERED AS PART OF AN OVERALL INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN I THINK IT WAS ALSO MENTIONED IN THE IN THE CUTS TO. OF FUNDING FOR THIS IS DANIEL GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT ACT AS DEALING WITH. ALL THE FARMERS WERE PROBABLY. GOING TO BE ON THE BRINK- WITH THIS DROUGHT- SO CAN CAN YOU JUST LAY OUT WHERE WHERE DOES THAT INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN LIVE IN AND WHAT WEIGHT WHAT MIGHT WE SEE IS THAT POTENTIAL MECHANISMS FOR. IF ACTUATING SAID THE PLAN AND THEN THE COMING WEEKS. YES I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO THOSE ISSUES AND THE MOST DIRECT ANSWER IS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE GOVERNOR AND THE ADMINISTRATION YOU WANT TO DO AND ARE THINKING ABOUT FINDING WAYS TO DO. THAT HAVE ENGINE WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU SETTLED ON THE PAST MECHANISM TO DO THAT YEAH WE KNOW. AS ALWAYS KNOW WHAT THE BUDGET IS UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE ON ME TO PROPOSE A BALANCED BUDGET. AS YOU MENTIONED SENATOR STIRRING THAT THESE LONGER TERM PRIORITIES. REBUILDING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE CLIMATE RESILIENCE AN ADAPTATION ARE ALSO VERY SIGNIFICANT FOR THE STATE'S FUTURE AND SO. THE REASON THAT SOME OF THOSE WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE NEIGHBOR ASIAN IS BECAUSE WE DIDN'T SEE A WAY SELECT TOP AND GIVEN CURRENT BUDGET REALITIES. BUT THE GOVERNOR HAS ALSO MENTIONS THAT CONNECTS YOU TO LOOK AT WAYS- WHETHER LOOKING AT. ADDITIONAL USES THE FEDERAL FUNDING IF MORE IS AVAILABLE AND EDUCATIONAL REVENUE DOWN THE LINE I DON'T KNOW. ON SUNDAY FOR SOME OF THESE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS ALL OF THESE ARE HARD AS- TOPICS GOVERNOR AT THEIR MANY MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE. ARE THINKING ABOUT. RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE. PROPOSAL IN THESE AREAS BUT WE WANT TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE. ON BECAUSE- HERE EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT RIGHT AND OF US IN TERMS OF THE MEDIA ALLEN'S. TRYING TO GET TO RECALL. THEY'RE ON VERY SINISTER. SELECT AND LONG TERM FUTURE. THANKS FOR THAT WE LOOK FOR WORKING THAT RIGHT IN THANK YOU MADAM BUT YEAR FOR THE INTELLIGENCE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR WILL TO SEND A SKIN. THANK YOU MADAM BUT CHAIR AND A TIME ELADIO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND EVERYONE WHO PARTICIPATED SO FAR IN PRESENTING US THE INFORMATION- I WILL TRY TO GO TO THESE VERY QUICKLY SO THE MY FIRST SET OF QUESTIONS ARE REGARDING- FURIOUS AT THE- WHAT I'LL CALL INTENT ON THE PROGRAM SO THE GOVERNOR'S ISSUED MANY GOOD EXECUTIVE ORDERS TO HELP THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF THIS PANDEMIC. FOR EXAMPLE LIFTING THE TWO WEEK WAIT ON UNEMPLOYMENT- AND BY WONDERED WHAT THINGS WITH IN THIS BUDGET. OUR OUR COMPARABLE TO ASSIST FOLKS IN HAT REGARD IN ALL EXPLAIN IN A SECOND SO FOR EXAMPLE. THE BUDGET SHOWS AS DOCTOR PAN POINTED OUT A INCREASE IN MEDI CAL CASELOAD AND THAT'S OBVIOUSLY DUE TO A DROP IN PEOPLES- INCOMES. BUT DOES THE BUDGET ALSO INCLUDE ANY- REMOVAL OF OBSTACLES FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO ENROLL IN MEDICARE QUICKLY SEVEN OTHER WORDS AS SOON MEAN FOR EXAMPLE IF THEY ARE ON AN UNEMPLOYMENT THAT THEY ARE THEN ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL. THAT IS ONE MAYBE I SHOULD LIST A COUPLE OF THESE AND THEY CAN ANSWER IT ONCE THE SECOND ONE IS ON SIMILARLY WE'D- SOME OF THE I THINK THE DELAYS ON FOR EXAMPLE- IN RULING IN CALIFORNIA'S. DOES THE- BUDGET. LOOK AT LIFTING EVEN IF TEMPORARILY OBSTACLES THAT LIMIT CALIFORNIA'S RESIDENTS ABILITY TO ENROLL IN PROGRAMS LIKE WAKE AND CALIBRATION SIMILAR WAY THAT I DESCRIBED AS MEDI CAL. CALLED OLD HEAR AN ANSWER ON THAT BEFORE AS THE NEXT QUESTION. SENATOR SCARE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT EVEN WHEN WE PRESERVE ELIGIBILITY I DON'T REALLY SOUNDS PEOPLE IF WE'RE NOT CREATING NEW HOOPS FOR PEOPLE TO SHOP FOR MAKING SURE. SIR IS. NOT TO BRING TO NEW HOOPS ARE REFERRED EXISTING HOOPS BUT GO AHEAD YES YES AND SO WHEN IT COMES TO THAT I'M GONNA TURN OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE BRIAN MILLER. THIS WAS JUST A AND DAY TO TALK ABOUT. HOW WE ARE WORKING TO REMOVE. WHEN YOU SENATOR SO- THAT CONCERNING AN ALIEN THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM I CAN'T SAY THAT THERE ARE ADDITIONAL PROPOSALS IN THE REVISION BUT THE BUDGET DOES SUPPORT AND FIND- MANY OF THE WAIVER ACTIVITIES THAT WERE SOUGHT IN THE SPRING TO TRY TO- YOU KNOW- ENHANCE PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO GET ON THE PROGRAM AND SO MY COLLEAGUE JACOB CAN GET INTO MORE DETAIL ABOUT. CLOSE JUGGLING GOVERNMENT FINANCES I MEAN SPECIFIC YOUR QUESTION WE ARE SENDING OUR AND OVER YOU TERMINATION SO MEDICAL PROGRAM SO THAT. ON AN ANNUAL BASIS OF REGULAR MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES HAS TO BE RECESSED FOR ENROLLMENT INTO THE PROGRAM. DURING THE STATE OF EMERGENCY WE ARE CURRENTLY SPENDING THAT OPERATION ADDITIONALLY WE ARE IMPLEMENTING- UNINSURED PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY FOR INDIVIDUALS FOR. POTENTIALLY ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL SO UNDER OUR- THE BILL IS THAT WE REQUEST. INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE UNINSURED WOULD BE ABLE TO ENROLL IN MEDICARE LITERACY COATED TESTING INCOME WOULD REALLY TREAT. FROM THE COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS- HAD SOME ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS I HOPE THAT THEY CAN BE DISCUSSED IN SUBCOMMITTEE. THE S. SIMILARLY I THINK THERE ARE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING CAL FRESH WHERE CAN PROGRAMS LIKE THAT ADDITIONALLY ON THE ECONOMIC FRONT. THE BUDGET INCLUDES- I BELIEVE SO AN INCREASE IN THE LOAN GUARANTEE FORCE OUR SMALL BUSINESSES WHICH OBVIOUSLY WILL GET DEBATED AND SAD BUT I WONDERED IF- IN A SIMILAR VEIN WHETHER THE BUDGET FOR- WAS CONSIDERING SUCH THINGS AS- A- ACROSS THE BOARD EXTENSION. ON AN EXISTING BUILDING PERMITS AND ZONING ENTITLEMENTS GIVEN THAT MUCH ACTIVITY HAD TO SEIZE THAT- RATHER THAN IN THE SAME WAY THAT RATHER YOU SHOULD YOU RATHER THAN YOU HAVING TO REAPPLY FOR MEDI CAL WHY WOULD WE HAVE EXISTING PER. HAVE TO BE. CERTAINLY WHICH WERE ISSUED ON A LOCAL GOVERNMENT BASIS BUT STILL THE- TIME STATE. HAS EXTENDED OTHER DEADLINES AND SUCH AND- I THINK IT IS WORTH CONSIDERING THOSE ADDITIONALLY THE STATE MIGHT CONSIDER A EXTENSION ON ALL STATE ISSUED CANNABIS LICENSES GIVEN THAT. A SUCH BUSINESSES AREN'T ELIGIBLE OTHER THAN FOR POTENTIALLY SOME STATE RELIEF THEY'RE NOT ELIGIBLE TO FOR ANY OF THE FEDERAL RELIEF THAT WAS- A PROVIDED IN ANY OF THE FEDERAL ACTS SO FAR. AND IF THERE'S IF THAT HAS NOT YET BEEN CONTEMPLATED I HOPE THAT THAT CAN BE DISCUSSED IN THE APPROPRIATE BUDGET SAT AND CONTEMPLATED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. THEN THE LA- THIS QUESTION IS DAILY- UNLESS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WANTS TO COMMENT ON EITHER OF THOSE. THE TICKET SO ON ELIO YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR PRESENTATION THAT- THERE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION RECOMMENDS FOR EXAMPLE A LIMIT ON THE TAKING THE TAX CREDIT EXPENDITURES TWO FIVE MILLION IT. FOR ANY ENTITY YOU MENTIONED THAT THERE MAY BE ADDITIONAL. ACTIONS LIKE THAT THAT MAY PROVIDE SOME. GENERAL FUND OR OTHER AGAIN- IT'S MORE A DELAY IN- IN AN EXPENDITURE VERSUS THE NEW REVENUE BUT- YOU YOU REFERENCED IT BUT SHE DIDN'T STATE ANY SPECIFICS. YES SENATOR SKINNER I APOLOGETICALLY BROKE UP JUST A LITTLE BIT COULD IS IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO RESTATE THAT THE AVERAGE THE IN YOUR PRESENTATION YOU REFERENCED. SUPPORT SORRY FOR THE ADMINISTRATION'S TIED. IN WHICH YOUR CALL WAIVER FOR LIMITATION ON ENTITIES TAKING CERTAIN TAX CREDIT EXPENDITURES WITHIN THIS- THIS UPCOMING FISCAL YEAR AND YOU MENTIONED THAT THERE MAY BE ADDITIONAL ONES THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER. BUT IN SPECIFIED. YES SO THE TAX- PROPOSALS FOR AUGMENTING THE REVENUE PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR AND THE NAME REVISION INCLUDE SUSPENDING NET OPERATING LOSSES THE ABILITY OF MEDIUM AND LARGE SIZED BUSINESSES TO UTILIZE THIS THIS IS A CASE WHERE THEIR DEDUCTIONS OR NET INCOME IS IN A NEGATIVE POSITION RESULTING IN A NET OPERATING LOSS AND THEY CAN USE THAT TO OFFSET THEIR TAX LIABILITIES AND THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO LIMIT THE USE OF THOSE FOR BUSINESSES. WITH BELIEVE IT'S A SAX MOMENT FIVE MILLION FIVE MILLION- OF. A MILLION ACTUALLY AND THEN THEY ARE. FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS THAT WOULD LIMIT THAT AND SO WHAT WE WERE SAYING IS THAT THAT IS IN EFFECT A WAY TO ACCELERATE THE TAX PAYMENTS THAT THEY MIGHT BE SUBJECT TO MAKING IN FUTURE YEARS THERE'S NO THIS IS A TAX CATEGORY THAT'S KNOWN FOR BEING HARD TO FORECAST AND SOME UNPREDICTABLE. AND YOU KNOW WE HAVEN'T FULLY WORK THROUGH THE DETAILS OF IT BUT WE SUSPECTED MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT HIGH IN THE- ADMINISTRATION'S ESTIMATES- SO YOU'RE SO WHAT YOU ARE REFERENCING WAS NOT POTENTIALLY ADDITIONAL ACTIONS LIKE THAT THAT YOU MIGHT RECOMMEND BU RATHER THAT THIS MAY HAVE TO BE CALCULATED DIFFERENTLY SECTOR ACT. THAT'S CORRECT OR THEY COULD BE STRUCTURED SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY THERE'S ANOTHER THERE'S ANOTHER. COMPANION PROPOSAL WHERE THEY WOULD LIMIT TAX CREDITS- BY BUSINESSES- AND THAT'S WHERE THE FIVE MILLION COMES IN. THE BUSINESSES WOULD NOT BE. ABLE TO UTILIZE TAX CREDITS IN EXCESS OF FIVE MILLION IN ANY GIVEN YEAR. AND THEN- THERE'S SORT OF A BEHAVIORAL EFFECTS ON THESE BUSINESSES AND SO THE ADMINISTRATION WE THINK GENERALLY CORRECTLY ACCOUNTS FOR HOW IF YOU. MAKE A CHANGE IN ONE OF THESE YOU YOU REALLY KIND OF NEED TO MAKE A CHANGE IN TE OTHER IN ORDER TO CAPTURE THE- FACT. LONG STORY SHORT I BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD- YOU KNOW OUR ANALYSIS OF THIS IS THAT IT DOES REPRESENTED ACCELERATION OF TAX COLLECTIONS INTO THE- NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS- BUT NOT NECESSARILY INCREASING IT ON ANY ONGOING BASIS. AND SOME OF THE KIND OF CHANGES THAT WE WOULD WE WOULD- ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT IS. RATHER THAN AND- CAN'T CALIBRATING IT FOR LIKE THE NET OPERATING LOSSES RATHER HAVING THAT APPLY TO BUSINESSES WITH NET INCOME OF MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S A CASE FOR YOU COULD HAVE A ONE BUSINESS COULD. NET INCOME OF NINE HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH IS VERY SIMILAR BUSINESS TO BUSINESS WITH A HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION OF NET INCOME SO INSTEAD OF- STRUCTURED THAT WAY ONE ONE ALTERNATIVE IDEA THAT WE HAVE IS. REALLY SET THE- SET A THRESHOLD FOR HOW MUCH IN NET OPERATING LOSSES ANY BUSINESS CAN TAKE AT A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR FOR EXAMPLE AND SO. IT WOULD REALLY- GENERATE THE ADDITIONAL REVENUES THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS TARGETING. BUT NOT- TREAT VIRTUALLY SIMILAR BUSINESSES IN A DIFFERENT WAY UNDER THE TAX CODE. THERE ARE OTHER OTHERS KIND OF GOING OUTSIDE OF WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING OTHER KIND OF TAX. CHANGES THAT THERE'D STILL AVOID- SORT OF A BROAD BASED TAX INCREASE CHANGING TAX RATES. THIS WOULD INVOLVE DOING THINGS LIKE INCREASE SCENE- THE STATE'S CONFORMITY WITH THE FEDERAL TAX LAW. SUCH AS- REDUCING OR CAPPING THE MORTGAGE INTEREST DEDUCTION SO THAT IT CONFORMS WITH THE ACTUAL FEDERAL TAX LAW. OR ELIMINATING THE MORTGAGE INTEREST DEDUCTION ON SECOND HOMES THOSE ARE TAX BENEFITS THAN GENERALLY APPROVED TO PEOPLE WITH HIGHER INCOMES AND HIGHER MEANS. AND SO- IF YOU MOVED IN THAT DIRECTION YOU COULD GENERATE SOME ADDITIONAL REVENUE WITHOUT OF FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGING THE TAX CODE. THERE THERE IS WE HAVE A WE HAVE SORT OF A LIST OF IDEAS KIND OF ALONG THESE LINES THAT WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO. WORK WITH YOU ON- AND I'LL STOP THERE UNLESS YOU WANT ME TO GO FURTHER ON THIS NO I APPRECIATE THAT. I REMEMBER THE DISCUSSION THERE WAS DISCUSSION LAST YEAR IN OUR TAX CONFORMITY ACTION WHY THE MORTGAGE ON SECOND HOMES WAS NOT INCLUDED. SO I APPRECIATE YOUR RAISING IT NOW AND- I WERE IN A OBVIOUSLY IT MORE TRUNCATED THE BUDGET DISCUSSION THAN USUAL BUT PERHAPS WE CAN STILL- ENTERTAIN SUCH CONCEPTS. ON NORMAN A DISCARDED DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- MY QUESTION HERE IS- ON PAGE THIRTY OF THE MAY REVISION- SORRY ON PAGE THIRTY HER. THESE MIKES ARE HARD ESPECIALLY WITH THESE MASKS IN FRONT OF US ANYWAY ON PAGE THIRTY OF THE MARY VISION. THERE IS A REFERENCE THIS IS IN THE HOUSING AREA. THERE IS A REFERENCE WHICH I SUPPORT WHICH IS. ACTION THAT COULD GUARD AGAINST PRIVATE SECTOR ACTORS BUYING UP DISTRESSED ASSETS- AS WE KNOW THAT OCCURRED DURING THE LAST RECESSION NANDED TO HAS NOT BEEN A BENEFIT TO MOST OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. ON I WON'T I DON'T NEED TO GO INTO DISCUSS INTO ELABORATION ON THAT BUT I WONDERED. WHY HE DID NOT SIEU SPECIFICS SOLVE REFERENCE PRICE ON NO SPECIFICS ARE THOSE. THE EITHER YOU CAN GIVE ME AN ANSWER NOW OR A HOPE THAT THE SUBCOMMITTEE A GETS INTO THIS AND- MAKE SURE THERE ARE SOME SPECIFICS. WE WILL GET BACK TO YOU IN THE SUBCOMMITTEE PROCESS ON SPECIFICS OKAY GREAT AND NOW I HAVE JUST A COUPLE OF. OF QUESTIONS ON THE CORRECTION SIDE MY SUBCOMMITTEE PUT A SUB FIVE I WILL OF COURSE MAKE THOSE PRIMARILY DURING MY OWN HEARING BUT THE FIRST THING I WOULD JUST LIKE TO- KIND OF MADE A NOTE OR MAKE A COMMENT ON. IS THAT IF YOU LOOK AT PAGE ELEVEN OF THE REVISED WHICH HAS A CHART THAT LISTS THE ARE AGENCIES IN THEIR GENERAL FUND. EXPENDITURES FOR NINETEEN TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND IN THAT CHART IN IN EFFECT SHOWS WHAT THE GF REDUCTIONS ARE GOING TO BE PER AGENCY IF THE BUDGET IS ADOPTED AS THE MAY REVISE IN OF. OF PROPOSES AND IN THAT CHART. THE CDC ARE HAS THE LOWEST PERCENT REDUCTION OF ALL AGENCIES IT IS UNDER 1% ALL OTHER AGENCIES THE NEXT LOWEST AGENCY IS AROUND 6% ALL OTHER AGENCIES ARE IN THE ORDER OF 17% FORTY PERCENT. AND IF YOU LOOK AT ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION IT'S A 94% GENERAL FUND REDUCTION NOW OBVIOUSLY. PERCENTS ARE SOMEWHAT ARE YOU CAN GET IN THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS CAN VERY BECAUSE IF A BUDGET IS VERY LARGE. A 1% REDUCTION CAN BE BIG BUT ACTUALLY. DE UM. THE IF YOU LOOK AT IT RELATIVE TO THE EXPENDITURE LEVELS I GUESS THE REAL QUESTION I HAVE IS WHAT. WELL I APPRECIATE SOME OF THE PROPOSALS WITHIN BE A SUB FIVE CATEGORY IN THEIR SOME GOOD ONES THAT REDUCE SPENDING THERE'S ALSO A VERY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF INCREASES GF INCREASES WHICH I THINK CONTRIBUTE TO THE FACT THAT THERE'S ONLY 1% REDUCTION IN GIVEN THAT. THE WE ARE FACING A FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT I'M KIND OF SURPRISED THAT- WHEN DEPARTMENT IS GETTING SUCH A MINIMALIST HAIR CUT. SENATOR SKINNER ON THAT ISSUE ALL ANSWER VERY BRIEFLY AND MAKES YOU POINTS I THINK NUMBER. ONE AND THEN YOU KNOW THERE'S PROBABLY BETTER THAN ANY THAT THAT DEPART IS A- COURT MANDATES AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS THAT MAKE IT HARD TO WHICH WE REDUCE COSTS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY NUMBER EXCUSE. CURRENT POPULATION TRENDS HOLD ON THE NAY REVISION JUST FOR PROS CLOSING TWO PRESENTS OVER THE MULTI YEAR WINDOW OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS SO THAT SHOULD HOPEFULLY CREATES. AND THAT'S OF COURSE WE WILL WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING AND WILL CONTINUE TO DISCUSS BUT IT DOESN'T GIVE ANY RELIEF TO THOSE PEOPLE WHETHER THEY ARE OUR STUDENTS. FOR OUR- LOOK VERY LOW INCOME PEOPLE AREN'T THE MANY OTHERS WHO WERE VERY ECONOMICALLY. IMPACTED BY OUR BY THE BY THE. THE CUTS WE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE TO MEET OUR DEFICIT SO I IN WHEN YOU BROUGHT UP POPULATION IN THIS WILL BE DISCUSSED OBVIOUSLY MORE IN MY A SUBCOMMITTEE THE MAY REVISE SHOWS THE AVERAGE DAILY POPULATION AT ABOUT A SPRING PROJECTIONS PRIOR TO ANY IMPACT ASSOCIATED WITH COVETED. HELLO ONLY HAD AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT A THOUSAND INMATE LOWER SO ONE HUNDRED AND 220-005-0030 SIX YOU DON'T NEED TO COMMENT A PURELY- RAISE IT AS IT'S A MUCH HIGHER POPULATION NUMBER THEN- OTHER DOCUMENTS SHOW AND THAT MAY I IF WE WERE SEEING THE ORIGINAL POPULATION NUMBERS IT MIGHT ASSIST DUSTIN TERMS OF THESE CAUGHT. BUT I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT AND WE'LL DISCUSS THEM IN MY SUBCOMMITTEE. ON THE- ON THE ISSUE OF THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE REALIGNMENT I JUST REYES THIS I THINK THERE WAS A LOT OF DEBATE LAST YEAR THE- ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED ELIMINATING THE JJ AND IN OUR INCORPORATING IT INTO THE DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES THIS BUDGET RECISIONS THAT. AND WOULD MOVE I THINK SENATOR OF A NELSON REFERENCED WOULD MOVE FOLKS TO THE- COUNTY FACILITIES WHICH OF HAS BEEN BASICALLY BEEN SOMETHING THAT MANY ADVOCATES HAVE ADVOCATED FOR A LONG TIME AND ARE COUNTY FACILITIES ARE- UNDER UTILIZED PRESENTLY BUT I JUST RAISE IT BECAUSE- I THINK WE THERE NEEDS TO BE ONGOING DISCUSSIONS IN ON HOW THE COSTS WILL BE CALCULATED TO ENSURE THAT THE COSTS WE BEAR THE STATE BEARS. DUE TO THIS CHANGE DOESN'T RESULT IN A HIGHER COST THAN THE STATE THE COST THE STATE IS CURRENTLY I'M EXPERIENCING SO JUST RAISE THAT IS A LITTLE MARKER AND THEN FINALLY. THERE IS BY. OF MY FINAL ISSUE IS WITHIN THE JUDICIAL. BRANCH DE COUNTY LAWLER. ARE NOW EXPERIENCING REVENUE SHORTFALLS. BECAUSE THEY ARE IN HIGHER DEMAND AS WE COULD IMAGINE PEOPLE ARE BEING ARE ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE IMPACTED ECONOMICALLY AND FACING WHETHER IT'S THINGS LIKE FAMILY COURT ISSUES CREDIT REPORTING ISSUES FORECLOSURES EVEN WITH OUR- EXTENSIONS. AND DRAWING UPON THEIR COUNTY LAW LIBRARIES SO WANTED THIS PLACE THAT MARKER ALSO AS TO WHETHER THE ADMINISTRATION'S TRACKING THIS ISSUE AND IF THERE'S A PLAN TO KEEP THAT VITAL SERVICE OPEN. AND THOSE ARE MY LAST ONES ON CD ON THE PUBLIC SIDE. SOME FIVE WILL GET INTO MORE DETAIL ON THE SUBCOMMITTEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SENATOR SKINNER BEFORE I GO TO OUR LAST TWO MEMBERS SENATOR LEYVA WILL BE FOLLOWED BY SENATOR DOLLY LET ME- MAKE SURE THAT THE- AT LET ME INVITE THE PUBLIC WNTING TO PARTICIPATE. IN THE PUBLIC COMMENT SECTION LET ME GIVE YOU THE DIAL IN AND TOLL FREE NUMBER NOW BECAUSE WILL BE GOING TO PUBLIC COMMENT AFTER OUR LAST TWO MEMBERS SPEAK. THE DEATH TOLL FREE NUMBER IS. ONE EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN. THREE THREE SIX FOUR FOUR FOUR ONE. THE ACCESS CODE IS. TWO NINE SEVEN THREE FOUR SEVEN FOUR AND IT'S ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN- OF THE HEARING AS WE SPEAK. WE'LL GO TO THOSE ON THE PHONE AFTER WE- MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO PEOPLE HERE IN THE GALLERY OR THE ADJACENT HEARING ROOM TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT. WITH THAT SENATOR LEYVA. THANK YOU MADAM BUDGET CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE THANK YOU TO EVERYONE- BUDGET STAFF FOR ALL OF YOUR HELP IN PREPARING ALL OF THIS. I HAVE- MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT- OUR SCHOOLS K. TWELVE AND HIGHER ED BUT I'M GOING TO SAVE THOSE FOR YOU RICHARD FOR WHEN WE MEET- NEXT MONDAY AND BUDGET SUB ONE. FIVE TO OUR QUESTIONS ABOUT TWO ISSUES THAT MIGHT SEEM RATHER SMALL BUT I THINK ARE IMPORTANT. AB SIX SEVENTEEN AND THE FUNDING IN THE BUDGET MOST OF YOU WILL RECALL THAT THIS IS THE COMMUNITY BASED CARE MONITORING PROGRAM THAT HAS BEEN FUNDED. THROUGH THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM I APPRECIATE THAT THERE IS TWO HUNDRED MILLION IN THE BUDGET AS LONG AS AUCTION PROCEEDS ARE SUFFICIENT. I HAVE CONCERNS AS THE DID MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE WILL MR LIKE HEALTHY. REGARDING WHAT WE WILL ACTUALLY GET IN- CAP AND TRADE MONIES SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'VE COME SO FAR ON. THE AIR AND WE'VE COME SO FAR IN OUR DISTRICTS THAT REALLY NEED THIS WORK I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T FORGET. THEM AND WE DON'T LET THIS GO TO WASTE SITE. WITHOUT OF THE WORKING DONE BY DISTRICTS COMMUNITIES MEMBER CLEAN UP LOW. WILL SIGNIFY PLACE ARE STOP GATHER. THIS IS FOR PROP. FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR GIVEN RECENT FINDINGS THAT EXPOSURE TO AIR POLLUTION WHEN COMBINED WITH COVERED NINETEEN A RESPIRATORY VIRUS BY NATURE. MAY RESULT IN DECREASED INCREASED DEATH EXAGGERATE EXACERBATE NEGATIVE HEALTH IMPACTS SO I JUST A WATERY IN RATE THAT I HOPE WE CAN DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO. FIND THAT TWO HUNDRED MILLION TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS PROGRAM MOVES FORWARD. SECONDLY I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T TALK ABOUT MY MOBILE HOME PEOPLE AS A CHAIR OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON MOBILE HOMES. THE REDUCTION OF FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND TWO AB ONE SEVENTY THREE THE IMPLEMENT THE IMPLEMENTATION WILL MEAN THERE IS LESS STAFF. TO ASSIST MOBILE HOME OWNERS AND APPLYING FOR THE MOBILE HOME REGISTRATION. FEE AND TAX WAIVER. AS I'VE SAID MANY TIMES MOBILE HOMES ARE THE LAST BASTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IF THESE FOLKS ARE EITHER CAN'T MAKE THEIR PAYMENTS AT THEIR KICKED OUT. IF THEY ARE OF THE LETTER THE MOBILE HOME GO BACK TO THE BANK THERE MOST LIKELY GOING TO BE IN A ON THE STREETS. SO WHAT I WOULD ASK IS FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR REDUCTION. IF WE CANNOT FIND THAT MONEY TO HELP AND HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS TAX WITH MP WAIVER IS OUT THERE FOR THEM. IT EXPIRES THIS DECEMBER IF WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THIS REDUCTION CAN WE MAKE SURE THAT IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WEEKS THEN THE WAIVER TO DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. TO ME THAT SEEMS LIKE A REASONABLE COMPROMISE THAT IS ALL I HAVE RIGHT NOW MADAM BUDGET CHAIR THANK YOU FOR THE TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL GO TO CENTER DOLLY AND SENATOR BAIL WILL BE OUR LAST PERSON SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. AND MEMBERS I KNOW I WANT THIS TO BE. COURTEOUS AND BUT I WANT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SOME STATEMENTS FIRST AND I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. YOU KNOW I HEARD FROM THE CHAIR WHEN WE STARTED ABOUT BEING TRANSPARENT AND- YOU KNOW THROUGH THIS PROCESS THERE'S A VOTE I COULD TAKE BACK IT WOULD BE SB EIGHTY NINE BECAUSE I FELT. I FEEL LIKE THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH OF THIS HAS BEEN LEFT OUT OF. THE PROCESS WE WERE ENGAGED I DON'T BELIEVE IT ALL AND SO FOR THE FUTURE VOTES I WILL NOT BE. ADVOCATING FOR. US CONTROL ACCOUNTS- FOR THE ADMINISTRATION I DON'T THINK IT'S THE WILL OF THE DEMONSTRATION OF THE PAST HAS NOT BEEN GOOD SO- AND I WANTED TO ASK. INSPIRATION TO ON YOU SAID SOMETHING ABOUT VACCINES SO I WANT TO KIND OF GET THE VISION. THIS BUDGET IS PRETTY. LAID OUT IN A WAY WHERE WE'RE GOING TO BE PUSHING DOWN ON COUNTIES AND CITIES WE'RE GOING TO BE SHIFTING FIRES AND BARRING MONIES- AND I KNOW THAT CITIES RELY ON PROPERTY OR OR SALES TAX MAINLY TO IN THEIR BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED. AND HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GENERATE THAT REVENUE NOW WE HAVE HAD THE MONEY'S COMING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THANK GOD- AND COUNTY SURVIVE MAINLY ON PROPERTY TAX SO THOSE ARE THE- THE TWO AREAS IT THERE WE GET THE HAVE BASICALLY NO ROOM. FOR US TO PUT OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THEM SO I WANT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THEM AND CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT. MANY OTHER MEMBERS BROUGHT UP ABOUT THE POPULATION DIVIDE IN WHO'S GOING TO END UP WITH WHAT. POTS OF MONEY. SO THAT I'D LIKE TO BE ANSWERED AND I LIKE TO THEN THE OVERALL. VISION OF WHAT. THE TIME FRAME IS. FOR COMING OUT OF THIS WE WERE TOLD- BY THE GOVERNOR'S CHIEF OF STAFF AND DOCTOR GALLEY IN MARCH THAT. THE PANDEMIC WOULD BE INTEL MAY THAT HE SUPPOSEDLY SUPPRESSES IT- SO IT'S GONNA BE SHORT TERM AND THE GOAL POST KEEPS MOVING SO I'M KIND OF TRYING TO FIND OUT I HEARD THE BOARD ARE WE GONNA WAIT TILL-THERE'S A VACCINATION. BECAUSE IF THAT'S THE CASE. CALIFORNIA'S IN OF IN A REALLY BAD WAY WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO- SHIFT AROUND SO THOSE THOSE ARE WHAT'S THE LONG TERM VISION WHAT WHAT DO YOU SEE- WHEN WE GET BACK SHE THERE'S AND THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BUDGETS OF ABOUT. GETTING BUSINESSES BACK GOING IN SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS SHIFTING. SENATOR DOLLINGER ON THOSE QUESTIONS AT FIRST I DEFINITELY WANT TO CLARIFY. WHEN REFERRING TO A POSSIBLE AND I DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW THE VACCINES FOR THE COMPANY NINETEEN. VIRUS IN THE FUTURE- I WAS REFERRING TO THAT AS- ANY PLAN A SERIES OF STAGES IN WHICH- WE GET CONTROL OUT OF. THE EFFECTS OF THE SECOND AND I JUST HAD ON ALL OF OUR LIVES BUT YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT THERE ARE INTERMEDIATE STAGES BETWEEN. NOW AND THEN STARTING WITH THE STATE'S CAREFUL RE OPENING STARTING WITH INVESTMENTS IN A CONTACT FACING OUTWARDS AND I THINK YOU'RE SEEING SOME OF THAT. FROM BEING MINISTRATION OVER THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO. MORE QUICKLY. THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO MAY AFRAID OF QUICKLY IT IS MOVING. CERTAINLY THE CALL A SECOND. AS SAFELY AS POSSIBLE CONTINUE TO REOPEN THE ECONOMY. PLACE WHERE WE WERE BEFORE THE STAINED AND WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING HEALTH AND SAFETY. WHEN IT COMES TO THAT YOU SPECIFIC ITEMS THAT YOU MENTIONED. FIRST ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS RECOGNIZING THE STRESS WE WERE UNDER IS WHY AT THE STATE EVEN THOUGH WE FACE SO MANY OF OUR OWN BY SUPPRESSORS. MINISTRATION ALL YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO RESOLVE THE NEXT FOUR WEEKS WE DIDN'T THINK THAT IT WAS RIGHT. ALL OF THE STATE ALLOCATION AND I'M NOT GOING HOURS USING ALL FOR THE STATE GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT PRESSURES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE UNDER AND THE FACT THAT WE ARE PARTNERS. THEY ARE IN THE- REYES. THE SERVER. THAT WE ARE SOMETIMES AND THEN THIS PLANE ON GONNA TRY TO OVER TO CHAMBER GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT REFUGE FORECAST. WHAT WILL STATE ACROSS A- IN DEVELOPING THAT FOR. WE ANTICIPATED AND THAT ACTUALLY OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL WEEKS AND MONTHS. THE ECONOMY WOULD BEGIN TO RIO. OVER THE COURSE OF THE LATE SPRING AND SUMMER I EVEN WITH THAT AS SOME OF THESE SCARS ON THE ECONOMY. I WOULD REVERBERATE FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS AND OBVIOUSLY OUR GOAL AS THE STATE IS TO MAKE THAT RECOVERY PROCESS AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE. BUT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ANTICIPATING RIGHT NOW AND WILL BE TREATED ALREADY J. JUST. BRIEFLY TALKED ABOUT- THE INPUTS INTO. OUR REVENUE FORECASTS. GOOD AFTERNOON ARMS SO WE WE'RE EXPECT A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN ALL THE REVENUE SOURCES OF THE MAJOR REVENUE SOURCES FROM THE STATE I THINK- ARE YOU OVER 20% LINE IN PERSONAL INCOME TAX SALES TAX INCORPORATION TAX FOR THE BUDGET YEAR. I THINK ONE ONE BRIGHT SPOT FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- TO DRESS YOUR CONCERN IS THAT OF THE PROPERTY TAXES IS SO WE EXPECT TO FARE. BETTER THAN THAN THE OTHER MAJOR REVENUE SOURCES- I'M MORE EXPECTING ANY- SOMEWHAT OF A OF A DECLINE. FROM WHAT WE HAD TO GET WE ARE PROJECTED TO GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BUT NOT NEARLY AS SIGNIFICANT AS OVERSEEING AND YET THE REVENUE SOURCE. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ABOUT STONE SO THANK YOU I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND WAS A CASE SUPERVISOR FOR SIXTEEN YEARS AND WE WON'T SEE THE REVENUE DROP. IN COUNTIES UNTIL EIGHTEEN MONTHS BECAUSE THERE OF THE CYCLE IS TAKE THAT LONG BUT CITIES ARE DIRECTLY IMPACTED IMMEDIATELY BY SALES TAX SO- ANYWAY APPRECIATE THOSE COVERS IT THE- THOUGHT THERE BUT I'VE MY GOOD IN MY BOOK. MY POINT IS THAT WE CANNOT PUSH DOWN ANYMORE LIABILITY OR- OBLIGATIONS TO CITIES AND COUNTIES- THEY'RE ALREADY TAPPED OUT AND I I'VE HEARD A LOT FROM MY FROM LOS I REPRESENT ELEVEN COUNTIES. THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT WAS UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MANY CALLS ON GETTING OUR SYSTEM IS BROKEN. IT DOESN'T ALLOW FOR- THE MASS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE TRYING TO GET APPOINTMENTS AND THE- ORIGINAL PEOPLE THAT SIGNED UP. DIDN'T CLICK THE BOX RIGHT WE DIDN'T HAVE A BOX FOR COVE IT AND SO IT REJECTED ALL THOSE PEOPLE AND THERE ARE A LOT OF MORNING AWARE THAT THEY'RE- THEY'RE NOT GETTING FILE BECAUSE IT REJECTED HIM AND WHAT ARE WE DOING IN THAT AREA. I KNOW THERE WAS A CONFERENCE CALL WITH ATTENDED ON IT THERE'S LIKE TWENTY FIVE PEOPLE THAT WORK IN THAT OFFICE BUT WE NEED. IMMEDIATE SUPPORT TO THE U. I. OFFICE SO WE CAN GET THESE BENEFITS OUT OF THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING THERE. I CAN I CAN SHARE STORY WITH YOU REAL QUICK. A PERSON WHO DRIVES AN S. U. V. WHO HAD A GREAT JOB BURN THROUGH THEIR SAVINGS AND IS TRYING TO GET FOOD FROM- THE NONPROFIT. BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GET THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. SENATOR WHAT I'LL SAY HERE IS I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION RECOGNIZES THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE FACING IN ESPECIALLY IN A PUBLIC FACING. AGENCY OR DEPARTMENT MIKEY D. WHEN THEY PEOPLE ARE DEPENDING ON THE STATUS STATES AND THEY'RE CERTAINLY NOT SHOWING UP AT THE SPEAKS ALL OF US WOULD WANT I THINK ALL I CAN SAY IS YOUR NUMBER ONE THAT YOU FOR WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK TO SPECIFICALLY ON MACS UDTS OUR SECOND EXTENDED YOUR CALL HOURS OR MORE PER DAY. ON THE WEEKEND IN TERMS OF CALL CENTERS I KNOW THAT THAT IS NOT. YOU MEAN PEOPLE AREN'T GETTING. THIS FOR RIGHT NOW BUT- WE ARE DOING THE BEST WE CAN NOW WITH AGE OLD WATCHFUL SYSTEMS ARE NOT CERTAINLY. NEED UPDATING AND SOME ASK FEDERAL ASSISTANCE HAS BEEN FORTHCOMING IN OUR EFFORTS TO REFORM THOSE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. I THINK THE OTHER CHALLENGE AND THIS IS A GOOD THING THAT. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CRAFTED ON ITS OWN THEN ESTATES ON OUR STUDENTS SIMPLY EXTEND. THAT WENT ON A- THEY ALSO ADDED AS YOU KNOW THE SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS PER WEEK ADDITIONAL BENEFITS. THERE WAS ALSO THE CAN DOWN THE KIND OF ON AN INSURANCE PROGRAM FOR PEOPLE. WHO MAY NOT QUALIFY FOR TRADITIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AT THE STATE LEVEL BUT ALSO LOST HER JOB I THINK THE CHALLENGES WHEN YOU HAVE ALL THESE DIFFERENT PIECES ON TOP OF EACH OTHER. YOU PUT IT ON TOP OF ANY AGE OLD TECHNOLOGICAL SYSTEMS AND THEN YOU SEE. THE I WE NEVER SEEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS. IF YOU GO BACK TO THE ONCE IN A CENTURY AND THIS IS TRULY UNBELIEVABLE YOU KNOW I THINK IN THE GREAT RECESSION. MONTHS IF NOT YEARS. FOR UNEMPLOYMENT TO READ JUST. A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN 12% FOR YES AND HE'S HERE WE'VE SEEN IN A MATTER OF WEEKS- SITTING WAY PAST THAT MARKS SO I THINK OUR SYSTEMS. DO YOU NEED A LOT OF IMPROVEMENTS BUT EVEN A WELL PUT TOGETHER SYSTEM- WOULD HAVE STRUGGLED UNDER THE STRAIN OF THE PANIC THAT WE'RE SEEING. BUT THAT'S A LONG ANSWER THE SHORT VERSION HERE SHORT ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IS ON THE PERFORMANCE THAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW EVERYBODY IN THE ADMINISTRATION. KNOWS IT NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED WE'RE WORKING AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RESOURCES AND. EXPERTISE IS THERE. PEOPLE EXACTLY THE PERSON YOU MUCH. THANK YOU. THAT THE FIRM. THE DOW YOU'RE DONE. THANK YOU WILL GONNA GO TO SENATOR BAIL. AND THEN WE WILL CLOSE WITH A TWO BILLS AND SENATOR BAIL. THANK YOU WELL I APPRECIATE BEING LAST. I A- I HAD A QUESTION ABOUT THE TRIGGERS- THE FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IS I UNDERSTAND IT IS THE TRIGGER A MILE AND- WERE LOOKING TO DEPEND ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR THOSE DOLLARS. AND THEY WILL BE AVAILABLE TO US FOUR OR ONE MAYBE TWO YEARS OR ARE I'D LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT GOD WHAT'S THE INTENTION. AND THEN THE HOW DID- ADMINISTRATION SELECT. THE PROJECT WERE THINGS THAT WERE COVERED BY THE TRIGGER AND THE BUDGET AND THE REASON I'M ASKING ABOUT IS IT APPEARS THAT YOU'RE SELECTING A LOT OF ON GOING EXPENSES ARE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT EDUCATION AND THAT'S A BIG A BIG I'M DOLLAR AMOUNT THERE BUT ALSO. PROGRAMS FOR DEVELOPING DISABLED AND I CAN ECHO ECHO SENATE CENTER SCANNERS REMARKS ABOUT THERE'S CERTAIN PROGRAMS THE SEEM TO BE. TARGETED A LITTLE BIT MORE AND I KNOW SAID THE RATES HAVE BEEN ROLLED BACK FOR THE DEVELOPMENT DISABLED. IT APPEARS THEY'VE BEEN ROLLED BACK FOR FIVE YEARS BACK TO WHERE WE HAD A FIVE YEARS AGO. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW. WHY. POPULATIONS THAT ARE CLEARLY IN DANGER DUE TO THE VIRUS. ARE HAVING SUCH LARGE CUTBACKS FOR THESE PROGRAMS THIS DOES NOT MAKE SENSE TO ME. OF IT IS NOT CLEAR TO ME WHY OUT. ROUTE WAS CHILDREN CHOSEN BY YOU- AND I REALLY THINK THAT OUGHT TO BE WE LOOKED AT SO MAYBE WE CAN GET A RESPONSE OR BUDGET DIRECTOR OF THAT. AND APPRECIATE SENATOR ROBB SCANNERS REMARKS ON AND WE'LL SEE HER AT UP. WEDNESDAY HEARING WE WERE GOING TO HAVE AN ARC SUBCOMMITTEE SO THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU MISTER THIS ONE OFTEN. YES HI SENATOR BALLOT I WILL MAKE AYE CHIU BRIEF POINTS ON THAT TRIGGERS THE ISSUES THAT YOU RAISE AND THEN I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE FRANK HOLLISTER WHO'S ON OUR HHS FINANCE YOU TALK ABOUT THE SPECIFICS OF THE GDS PROVISIONS THAT YOU MENTION. THE FIRST POINT SPEAKING VERY BROADLY IS THAT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE ITEMS THAT WERE IN THE TRIGGER VERSES WERE NOT THESE WERE A LOT OF AYE SINCE THEIR GENERALLY HERE'S ANY ITEMS THAT WERE COMPOSED AS NEW EXTENSIONS IN JANUARY- WERE MOSTLY WHAT'S WRONG AND NOT INCLUDED- BECAUSE THOSE WERE NOT A SIGN BUDGET ON THE TWENTY NINETEEN. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THAT BASED. IN ON. ITEMS TWENTY NINETY BUDGET I. MIGHT THE LCS FOR WHITE BASED ON FUNDING THAT WE- TO YOU SEE. YES YEAR DOES CUTS. ACTUALLY TO MAKE BECAUSE THERE WERE A BACK EVEN WASN'T NINE. NOT TO WHAT WE ARE TO X. TWENTY. DOES WERE GENERALLY THE ITEMS THAT WORKPLACE IN THE TRACKER AND THE SECOND POINT IS YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT. IF NOT MOST OF THE ITEMS IN THE TRAILERS ARE ONGOING EXPENDITURES SO IT IS THE CASE AND WE'RE VERY COGNIZANT UP THIS THAT EVEN IF FEDERAL FUNDING ARRIVES IN THE AMOUNT OF FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS WOULD TRIGGER OFFICE. FOR THE BUDGET YEAR TWENTY TWENTY DASH TWENTY TWENTY ONE. BUT WE WOULD STILL NEED TO FIND WAYS TO ON THOSE EXPENDITURES IN THE YEARS AFTER THAT WHEN WE ARE FACING STRUCTURAL DEFICITS AND THAT'S ONE REASON WHY. WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ARE ASK FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS FOR ASKING FOR SIGNIFICANTLY MORE. BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT. IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO EVER. ONE OF ON GOING BASS. BECAUSE IS MY CALLING TO CHAMBER ONE. THE IS GOING TO STAY SEVERAL YEARS TO RECOVER. WHEN IT COMES IS TYPICALLY TO. THAT SERVICE. RATE REDUCTIONS YOU TURN IT OVER TO GRANT AT STOCK OF HOW. THE THOUGHT ABOUT THOSE THAT CUT IN ANY AREA WICKS IS PAINFUL AS WE WERE. THIS YEAH EARLY. EMPTY THIS IS THE RESOURCES ROOM HOPING WE CAN USE TO WRAP AROUND HOUSE ARE TYLER WHAT I. OKAY MAYBE- LATER TO GET BACK TO ME BUT- BUT- MY POINT MY POINT I WANNA SHOES ON THE ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE BUDGET PROPOSAL. WHY WHY ARE. WHY RISK AS OF YOU KNOW FOR THE TRIGGER STILL GOING TO FACT- THOSE PROGRAMS GET C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt;</u> AUTOMATICALLY RIGHT WHAT I REALIZE THE KINDS OF PROBLEMS. THAT WERE HAPPENING WHEN WE PUT THAT MONEY FIVE YEARS AGO IN THE BUDGET IN THE FIRST PLACE I KNOW THAT I WORK WITH IT WAS A BIPARTISAN EFFORT THEN WE WORK WITH GOVERNOR BROWN TO PUT THE MONEY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT DISABLED BACK INTO THE BUDGET. BECAUSE WE WERE STARTING TO SEE PLACES CLOSE PROGRAM SHUTTING DOWN- YOU KNOW HOUSING UNITS SO FOR THE DEVELOPMENT DISABLED- DECIDED THEY WORK CONTINUE ON- ALL THESE PROBLEMS WAY WAY CREEK THEIR PRODUCTS AND A PROBLEM NOW. WITH THESE. WHO ARE VERY HIGH REAL US TO THE VIRUS. AND WE SHOULD NOT BE DOING THIS FOR THOSE KINDS OF PEOPLE. I DON'T TRUST THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S GONNA COME UP WITH ANYTHING BUDGET JULY. OF MADE DOES ANYBODY WANT TO PUT MONEY ON THAT I'LL TAKE THAT. SO I THINK IT COULD BE. STALEMATE UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION I MEAN- SO I WANT TO KNOW WHY THOSE PROGRAMS WERE ACTED JUST. IT'S LIKE- INCONGRUENT SO- SENSE OF PRIORITIES AND PROTECTING PEOPLE THAT ARE. DISABLE THAT HAVE HEALTH PROBLEMS TO BEGIN WITH AND ARE VERY VULNERABLE TO THE VIRUS ITSELF WHITE WHERE IT RISKS THOSE PEOPLE WE DON'T NEED THAT. SO I LIKE I LIKE SOME KIND OF ANSWER BUT I LIKE IT. MAYBE MAYBE IT'S A HIGHER LEVEL THAT WE SHOULD HAS THAT SHOULD ANSWER THOSE THE GOVERNOR THE CHIEF OF STAFF I LIKE TO KNOW THOUGH I AM I AM. WE HAD QUITE A LONG BATTLE TO GET THOSE MONIES IN THE FIRST PLACE. IF EVERYBODY REMEMBERS THAT I I'LL BE WILLING TO GO GO THROUGH IT AGAIN. BUT HI I LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THE ANSWERS ARE. SENATOR NOW I JOE DAYCARE DIESEL GENERATOR ON THING THERE'S A SATISFYING ANSWER YOUR AND YOU MENTIONED I'M NOT THE HIGHEST LEVEL THE GOVERNOR. SENDING HIS NEIGHBOR VISION PRESS CONFERENCE SAID THIS AREA OF CONSTANT PARTICULAR IN THE COSTS THAT ARE IN THE TRIGGER BUT HE SAID THEY BREAK HIS HEART AND SO. ALL OF THESE CUTS ARE PAINFUL CUTS IN THE AREA THAT YOU MENTIONED CRITICAL OR WE SO- BUT EVEN WITH THE CONCEPT WE HAVE A WE CONTINUE TO HAVE AN ON GOING. PROBLEM AND SO THESE ARE WERE SIMPLY TO CUTS. THAT THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE TO PUT FORWARD A BALANCED BUDGET FOR THIS YEAR. WHEN NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR BILL GOING TO GO TO SENATOR NIELSEN FOR ONE MORE COMMENT AND THEN WILL BE PREPARED TO OPEN IT UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. SENATOR NIELSEN.

CLOSE TO THE OBSERVATION THAT WHATEVER WE ARE GOING TO BE DOING IT. AND WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS BILL BEFORE SO I BELIEVE WE'LL GET THERE. BUT IT IS INDEED. THE KEY. IS ECONOMY. BUT WHAT WE DO IN THE BUDGET. HERE BUT WHAT GOES ON WITH THE ECONOMY OTHER THAN WHAT WE DO IN THE BUDGET AS IT ENCOURAGES RATHER THAN DISCOURAGES. THE ECONOMY BOTH IN THE LEGISLATURE AND IN THE LEAD THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. AND IN THE BUDGET. AND I MAY BE WRONG I AM NO IMMINENT. ECONOMIST BUT I TRULY BELIEVE IN AMERICA TODAY IN CALIFORNIA TODAY. THERE'S A PATH UP INTO GSM ABOUT GETTING BACK TO WORK. THAT WILL TRANSLATE INTO A GREAT ECONOMIC JUMPED IN A RETURN TO OUR PROSPERITY AS WE'RE DOING THAT. AND I DO APPRECIATE THAT EACH DAY IT SEEMS ALMOST THE GOVERNOR IS OPENING UP A BIT MORE. AND I ENCOURAGE THAT TO CONTINUE BECAUSE AS FAR AS GETTING OUT OF THIS DEEP HOLE AND STAYING OUT OF IT WHICH WILL REQUIRE SOME STRUCTURAL THINGS THAT WILL DO HERE BUT THAT IS SO KEY. AND YOU ALL SEE IT AS I DO IN AREAS THAT WE REPRESENT. THOSE HOLLOW LICE WONDERING AROUND OR SITTING AT HOME FRUSTRATED. GETTING ANTSY. HAVE AN WHAT THEY'VE CALLED CABIN FEVER. BUT THEN THAT QUICKLY TRANSLATES AND I DO NOT THINK IT HAS QUITE YET BUT TO FEAR. OUTRAGE FEAR. AND I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WE DARE LET THAT HAPPEN.
