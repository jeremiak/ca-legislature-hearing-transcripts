THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE I'D LIKE TO WELCOME. THE A CO CHAIRS OF THE OTHER SUBCOMMITTEES THAT ARE A COMMITTEES THAT ARE HERE -- A GUY CHAIR QUIRK MY CASKEY AND ALAN -- THIS IS FAIRLY UNIQUE THAT WE HAVE -- THIS MANY COMMITTEES MEETING ON ONE TOPIC I THINK GIVING AT LEAST SOME INDICATION OF HOW IMPORTANT IT IS I ALSO WANT TO WELCOME THE MEMBERS OF THE VARIOUS. COMMITTEES WHO ARE HERE WITH US IN WHO WILL BE ARRIVING DURING THE COURSE OF THE MEETING. pPIECE OF TESTIMONY THAT'S GOING ON ELSEWHERE IN THE COUNTRY IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE LOOKING AT YOUR PHONE DURING THE MEETING I WILL UNDERSTAND WHY -- THAT IS STILL GOING ON IS IT NOT -- THE DTS SEE SERVES A VERY -- VITAL FUNCTION WHICH IS TO PROTECT PEOPLE AND ENVIRONMENT AND THE ENVIRONMENT FROM TOXIC SUBSTANCES AND HAZARDOUS WASTE UNFORTUNATELY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS DTS SEE HAS BEEN PLAGUED WITH CONTROVERSY. RANGING FROM FISCAL MANAGEMENT ISSUES -- TO AND INCONSISTENT ARE INCONSISTENT RECORD KEEPING AND SUFFICIENT ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES AND SOME LACK OF TRANSPARENCY. OF FOR EXAMPLE A STATE AUDIT ON THAT THE TSC FAILED TO COLLECT AN ESTIMATED ONE HUNDRED NINETY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN CLEANUP COSTS. FROM A POLLUTERS DATING BACK. TO NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN A FAILED TO SEND OUT NEARLY A HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS AND BILLS. AND FOR THE FIFTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN ASSESSMENTS -- THE DTS EMAILED A BUT NEVER COLLECTED. THEN IN TWENTY FIFTEEN DETAILS HE CAME UNDER FIRE FOR THE DELAYED CLEAN UP OF THE EXIDE BATTERY RECYCLING PLANT AND BURN AND AFTER NEIGHBORS OF THE PLAN COMPLAINED FOR YEARS ABOUT BEING SICKENED. BY LEAD AND ARSENIC. COMMUNITY GROUPS TO LIVE NEAR HAZARDOUS WASTE FACILITIES ARE CONCERNED THAT DETAILS SEE IS NOT PROPERLY ENFORCING STATE AND FEDERAL LAW AND ALLOWING FACILITIES THAT HAVE NUMEROUS VIOLATIONS OF STATE LAW. AND REGULATIONS OR HAVE AN EXPRED PERMIT TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE. THE REGULATED COMMUNITY IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT IT TAKES DE TSC TO PROCESS A PERMIT WITH PROCESSING A PERMIT EXTENDING YEARS -- AT TIMES BEYOND THE EXPIRATION DATE OF THE PERMIT. THE LEGISLATURE THROUGH BOTH THE BUDGET AND POLICY PROCESS HAS MADE MANY ATTEMPTS TO REFORM THIS DEPARTMENT AND REGAIN PUBLIC CONFIDENCE AND UNFORTUNATELY EACH OF THESE ATTEMPTS WERE EITHER FORWARDED OR MADE AND SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS. THIS IS AN INDICATION THAT THE PROBLEMS AFFLICTING THE DEPARTMENT ARE FAR REACHING AND SYSTEMIC. DTS SEES CURRENT LEVEL OF SERVICE IT IS EVIDENCED BY THEIR SUBSTANTIAL HABIT HAZARDOUS WASTE PERMIT BACKLOG. HOWEVER BASED ON SOME OF THE BUDGET ACTIONS LAST YEAR I FEAR THAT DTS SEES FISCAL HEALTH HAS DETERIORATED DETERIORATED FURTHER TO A POINT WHERE CAN NO LONGER SUSTAIN ITS FUNCTIONS. EVEN AT CURRENT LEVELS IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN FISCAL SOLVENCY AND BOTH OF THEIR MAIN ACCOUNTS. THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FUNDED CERTAIN ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD NORMALLY BE FUNDED OUT OF THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACCOUNT OR THE HAZARDOUS WASTE CONTROL ACCOUNT. INSTEAD -- FUNDED WITH THEY WERE FUNDED WITH THE LEAD ACID BATTERY FUND -- THIS -- TO EMPLOYER DOUBLE METAPHOR -- PUTS US IN A POSITION WHERE ROBBING PETER TO PAY PAUL AND FURTHER KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD -- IT IS IT'S A DOUBLE METAPHOR. YOU FOR CALLING ME ON THAT. THE BUT IN POINT OF FACT THIS IS REALLY UNACCEPTABLE. WAITING TO RESOLVE THESE ISSUES WOULD FURTHER JEOPARDIZE DTS SEES ABILITY TO ME THAT'S REGULATORY MANDATE -- THEIR ROLE IN PROTECTING THE PUBLIC AND THE ENVIRONMENT IS SIMPLY TOO IMPORTANT TO WAIT FURTHER. AND I HOPE THAT THIS HEARING WILL BEGIN REFORM AND FIX THE STATE'S MANAGEMENT OF HAZARDOUS WASTE ONCE AND FOR ALL. OF THIS IS A NEW ADMINISTRATION AND A CHANCE TO MAKE PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH AND HE ENVIRONMENT A PRIORITY BY FOCUSING OUR EFFORTS TO REFORM THE STATE'S MANAGEMENT OF HAZARDOUS WASTE -- SHOULD BE AT THE TOP OF OUR LIST. WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE MY CULTURES TO SAY A FEW WORDS DUCT WORK. THANK YOU CHAIR BLOOM. BOMB I THINK CHAIR BLOOM -- SUMMARIZED OF THE CONCERNS WE HAVE IT'S EVIDENT TO ME AS WELL IF THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH RESOURCES IN THAT WE DO HAVE A NEW ADMINISTRATION AND WE'RE HOPING TO WORK TOGETHER -- TO IMPROVE MANAGEMENT AS WELL AS I HOPE -- GET THE ACT. ADVOCATE RESOURCES -- TO FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO ACHIEVE ITS VERY IMPORTANT MANDATES -- I WANTED -- TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE OTHER ASSEMBLY MEMBERS YOU'RE HERE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CRISTINA GARCIA REBEKAH BAUER CON DEVON MATHIS -- ELOISE GOMEZ REYES JOAQUIN ARAMBULA AND VINCE FONG -- AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT WE SELDOM GET HEARING WITH THIS MANY MEMBERS HAD AT AND I THINK THAT SHOWS THE IMPORTANCE AND SERIOUSNESS WITH WHICH WE TAKE ON THIS ISSUE THANK YOU.

A GOOD MORNING I WANT TO THANK CHAIR BLOOM FOR INVITING MY COMMITTEE JOINED THIS HEARING THE DEPARTMENT THE THE ENVIRONMENT QUALITY COMMITTEE -- IT'S CLEAR TO ALL OF US THAT THE TSC HAS A CRITICAL -- CRITICALLY IMPORTANT MISSING PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT. FROM TOXIC HARM AND JUST LIKE MY COLLEAGUES I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT -- SOME OF THE CONTINUE TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY AND FISCAL ISSUES THATWE'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT. HOW THE DEPARTMENT? OF THE STAFF ANNOUNCES THIRD OF FOLKS MAY HAVE A NOTES THAT THE DEPARTMENT'S LARGE. AND GROWING REVENUE SHORTFALL COULD FURTHER IMPEDE THE DEPARTMENT'S ABILITY TO CARRY OUT ITS CORE MISSION AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT TODAY STAFF ALSO TALKS ABOUT HOW. THERE ARE SEVERAL REASON LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS -- THAT HAVE BEEN PUSHED FORWARD TO IMPROVE DGSE BUT AS WE KNOW THEY'VE BEEN VETOED -- AND THEN THEY WERE USUALLY VETOED CITING THE FINANCIAL PROBLEMS AT THE DEPARTMENT SO. LET'S FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON AND WE'RE GONNA BE HEARING FROM OUR NEW SECRETARY OR ACTING DIRECTOR ABOUT WHAT'S BEING DONE TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES MOVING FORWARD -- ALSO LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING FROM SOME OF THE STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT'S EFFORTS TO ADDRESS ENFORCEMENT AND PERMITTING ISSUES A SOME OF OUR HOUSE HAZARDOUS WASTE FACILITY SO THERE'S A LOT. TO UNPACK HERE I'M VERYPLEASED THAT DIED CHAIR BLOOM HAS AS AS REALLY TAKEN A LEADERSHIP ROLE ON THIS ISSUE AND LIKE TO TURN TO MY MY GOOD COLLEAGUE. THANK YOU -- DID YOU SEE FINANCES ARE KEY FOR IT.

I'VE COVERED THESE ISSUES AS BOTH THE POLISH FROM FOR BOTH THE POLICY IN THE FISCAL A STAMP POINTS IS MY ROLE HERE IS CHAIR OF A BUDGET SUB TO IN THE SENATE -- FOR RESOURCES ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY BUT ALSO AS A FORMER CHAIR OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY IN THE IN. THE STM. THE COMMON THREAD THAT I'VE SEEN IN THE PAST YEARS AND THIS IS -- THREE A IS SET FORTH IN THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW PANEL NUMBER STAKEHOLDERS IS AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT WE WE NEED TO GET THE DEPARTMENTS FINANCES AND PROGRAMS IN ORDER. BUT I WOULD CAUTION PEOPLE ABOUT THIS RUSH TO THE GATE TO GUILLOTINE. YOU KNOW THE CORE CHOMP OF OF DTS SEE IS PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY IT'S NOT BEING A DEBT COLLECTOR IS NOT SENDING OUT BILLS IT'S NOT SENDING OUT. YOU KNOW REDUCING THEIR ACCOUNTS PAYABLE YOU CAN BE AN EXCELLENT DOCTOR. INSTILL NOT COLLECT YOUR BILLS AND MAYBE NOT SAID NOT YOUR CHOP GETTING THE JOB DONE. WE WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH THE BUDGETARY THE ACCOUNTS OF THE HAZARDOUS WASTE CONTROL ACT IN THE TOXICS CUPS AND SUBSTANCE CONTROL ACT. THESE -- WE FALL IN LOVE WITH SPECIAL FUNDS BECAUSE WE THINK THESE MONIES ARE GOING TO BE USED TO FUND EVERYTHING AND WE FOUND OUT ITS ARE IN THE REVIEW AND IN THE YEAR OF HEARINGS THAT WE HAD ON THE HIGH EFFICIENCIES BECAUSE I CAN'T DO THAT JOB BECAUSE I'M BEING. PAID THAT IT THAT -- THE TOXIC. SUBSTANCE CONTROL ACT AND I'M AND THIS WOULD BE ANOTHER AREA SO WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT FINANCIALLY HOW THIS MOVE THAT OUT SO PEOPLE CAN PERFORM BETTER IN THEIR ENTIRE JOB. UNFORTUNATELY THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF DISCUSSION INVESTMENTS WITHOUT QUESTIONABLE CORRESPONDING IMPROVEMENT FUND FROM EVERYBODY'S PART YOU KNOW IT'S ONE THING IS THE I. R. I. R. P. COMES OUT WITH THEIR QUARTERLY RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE ONE OFF BILLS TO COME IN ON ONE LITTLE RECOMMENDATION. AND NOT SIT BACK AND LOOK AT THE WHOLE POLICY AFTER REPORT CAME OUT LAST JANUARY SO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT REPORT AND SAY WHAT WE DOING. I WILL REPORT THAT THE STATUTE WE ARE ON IN THE PROCESS QUIETLY OF HAVING THE STATUTE. RE WRITTEN YOU KNOW SO THAT WHEN TWO WERE ON THE SAME PAGE WHETHER IT'S THE DEPARTMENT WITH THIS ONE OF OUR LITTLE ONE OF OUR COMMITTEES OR WHETHER IT'S THE CONTROL THE THE PEOPLE WHO. BUY BUY IT IT'S A PATCHWORK BANDAIDS DUCT TAPE IT'S INCREDIBLE SUGGEST KID. ALL THE AREAS TO DEAL WITH. AT LEAD ACID BATTERY IN ONE CHAPTER SO EVERYBODY KNOWS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DOESN'T MAKE THE HEADLINES FOR THE LA TIMES IN THE CHRONICLE BUT IT'S GET THE WORK IS GETTING DONE. ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY ARE IMPERATIVE IN ORDER THAT WE TOOK ADDRESSED THE PROBLEMS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE TO DTS HE'S FINANCES ARE IN ORDER. AND FUNCTIONING AS TO TAKE CONSIDER IT'S IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF ALL FOUR COMMITTEES IN THE MEMBERS IT IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA.

THANK YOU WE ALSO WANT TO WELCOME MY SENATORS SAID JONES STONE AND MINING AND TO A WITH ANY OTHER MEMBERS LIKE TO MAKE OPENING COMMENTS AYE SOFTNESS GOMEZ REYES HAD. EARLIER. THANK YOU FIRST I WANT. TO THANK ALL THE COMMITTEES IN ATTENDANCE TODAY IN THE RESPECTIVE CHAIRS FOR SCHEDULING. CRITICAL HEARING. IT IS CLEAR THAT WE ARE HERE BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCE CONTROL HAS SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS. THESE PROBLEMS HAVE EXISTED WILL BE FOR SOME OF US WERE ELECTED IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND A PERSISTENT. SINCE. ALTHOUGH I DO NOT PRETEND THAT THE CHALLENGES FACING THE DEPARTMENT OR EASY TO FIX WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT THE CURRENT FUNCTIONAL AND FISCAL STATUS. OF DTS SEE IS SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE. FIXING WHAT SEEMS TO BE AN ANNUAL AND REOCCURRING ISSUE NEEDS TO BE A PRIORITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND I HOPE. FOR THE NEW SOME ADMINISTRATION. I BECAME INVOLVED IN THIS ISSUE WITH A TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN I INTRODUCED AB. TWO FORTY EIGHT WHICH WOULD HAVE CHANGED THE TIMELINE FOR THE SUBMISSION OF APPLICATIONS FOR PERMITS RENEWAL. THROUGH THE TSA TO ENSURE THEY ARE PROCESSED IN A TIMELY MANNER. THEN GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN VETOED IT SAYING. LET ME LOOK FORWARD TO PARTNERING TO ADDRESS THIS CRITICAL PROBLEM. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN I REINTRODUCE THIS MEASURE AND ALTHOUGH HOPEFUL MY COLLEAGUES AND I WERE NOT MET WITH THE PARTNERSHIP NECESSARY. TO MOVE THIS ISSUE FORWARD. DTS THREE DOES NOT OPERATE IN THE WAY THAT PROTECTS THE PUBLIC. AND THIS LEAVES CALIFORNIANS ESPECIALLY IN DISADVANTAGED AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES EXPOSED TO TOXIC SUBSTANCES THAT CAN AFFECT THEIR LIVES FOREVER. LIVES ARE AT STAKE AND OUR URGENCY TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM MUST REFLECT THAT. THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY OTHER MEMBERS LIKE TO MAKE COMMENTS THEN I I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE. OUR FIRST AND ONLY PANEL -- TO A STEP FORWARD -- THEY WILL BE SECRETARY JARED BLUMENFELD. TO AND AMERICA'S WILLIAMS THE ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL FRONT CHEST COULDN'T AGREE THE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR DTS. AND SEAN MARTIN A PRINCIPAL FISCAL POLICY ANALYST WITH THE LA -- WELCOME TO ALL OF YOU AND TO CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR APPOINTMENT TO THE SECRETARY BLUMENFELD MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO STAY FOR THE ENTIRE HEARING -- HIGH AND SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE MEMBERS IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS OF THE SECRETARY TO ASK -- PROBABLY AT THAT AT THE CLOSE. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU -- TO THE CHECK HAS BLOOM QUIRK Y. KOWSKI ALAN AND TO ALL THE MEMBERS -- I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT. POINT -- AND TIME FOR US TO REALLY LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE AND UNDERSTAND WHERE WE ARE AND I'M I'M REALLY. THANKFUL FOR YOU CORAL CALLING THIS HEARING TODAY -- I'M GOING TO PROCEED WITH PROVIDE A VERY BRIEF INTRODUCTION -- AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM BOTH TALK TO MEREDITH WILLIAMS AND FRANCESCA DEGREE IS THAT -- CHIEF DEPUTY IN SOME DETAIL ABOUT WHERE WE ARE ON THE BUDGET. THE THE MAIN REASON THAT I WANTED TO COME BEFORE YOU TODAY IS TO HIGHLIGHT THREE BASIC THINGS -- THE FAST IS THAT WE TAKE THE FISCAL AND THE AND FISCAL HEALTH AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF DTS SEE EXTREMELY SERIOUSLY. SECONDLY THAT WE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND ESTABLISHING. A DTS THE LEDGE OF THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MANY YEARS HAS RESULTED IN BOTH FINANCIAL CLARITY. AND ACCURACY AND FINALLY THE AS THE SECRETARY OF CALIFORNIANS ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH YOU ANTI TSC EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. TO ENSURE THAT WE GIVE YOU FINANCIAL DAY. THAT WE PROVIDE YOU WITH A PLAN ON HOW WILL RECONCILE. RECONCILE REVENUES -- A STABLE AND APPROPRIATE FUND BALANCE AND EXPENDITURES. AT THE END OF THIS EXERCISE IT LIKELY THAT STRUCTURAL DEFICITS WILL REMAIN. AS YOU HAVE FROM FRANCESCA THE DEFICITS ARE LARGELY A FACTOR OF OUTDATED FEE STRUCTURES MARRIED WITH CLEAN UP AND STAFFING COSTS THAT HAVE OUTSTRIPPED REVENUE. BEFORE WE CAN MAP DDS SEES PATH TO FINANCIAL HEALTH WE NEED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE EXPENDITURES THE EXPENDITURES SIDE OF THE LEDGER. THEY'LL BE EFFICIENCIES RESULTING FROM MY WORKLOAD MODELING THEY CAN REDUCE FUTURE COSTS WHILE ALSO DOING A BETTER JOB OF COST RECOVERY FROM POLLUTERS. AT THE SAME TIME. COSTS INCLUDING A 10% COST YEAH -- AND OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE OF FEDERAL SUPERFUND SITES. PLUS COSTING CATCHING CLEANING EXISTING AND FUTURE OFTEN SITES THOSE A SITES WHERE THERE'S NO RESPONSIBLE PARTIES. ALL SET TO INCREASE. AS YOU HAD NONE OF THESE STEPS WILL BE QUICK OR EASY BUT THEY ARE ESSENTIAL. ARMED WITH A CLEAR SENSE OF OUR FINANCIAL FUTURE WE CAN TAKE THE NEXT STEPS TO REBUILD TRUST IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE SAT. THE COMMUNITIES THAT IN MANY CASES FEEL LEFT BEHIND DI DI TSC. I COMMITTED TO MAKING TO HELPING DGSE MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE LAW. AND IN FULL VIEW OF THE PUBLIC. ONCE WE HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION AND THE INPUT NEEDED TO MAKE A DECISION I AM COMMITTED. TO HELPING MAKE THOSE DECISIONS COME QUICKLY. APARTMENTS NEED TO BE WRITTEN IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY CAN BE ENFORCED. AND OUR ENFORCEMENT NEEDS TO BE BOTH STRONG AND FAST. HELLO FOR TO WORKING WITH EACH OF YOU WITH THE PUBLIC HOUSE STUFF AND THE REGULATED COMMUNITY TO RETAIN THIS IMPORTANT AGENCY BACK TO HEALTH. I BE PLEASED ON TO ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE -- AND IN CLOSING I'D SAY THAT IN THE UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY WIDE WHERE I WAS THE REGIONAL ADMINISTRATOR. FOR SEVEN YEARS I OVERSAW THE SUPERFUND PROGRAM -- THAT SUPERFUND PROGRAM HAS A HUNDRED PLUS SITES IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT WAS THE ROBUST PROGRAM IT WAS WELL RUN -- THAT CASE MANAGES AND THAT DEBT COLLECTING GOT THE BILLS PAID ON TIME. ARE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS WERE DONE ON TIME SO I'M FAMILIAR WITH WHAT IT TAKES AND WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. TO HAVE AN EFFECTIVE AND WELL RUNNING ORGANIZATION THAT CLEANS UP HAZARDOUS WASTE SITES AND I I JUST WANNA THANK ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE MANY OF YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS A LONG TIME. AND THE PROGRESS HASN'T BEEN SUFFICIENT. AND OUR GOAL IS TO WORK TOGETHER COLLABORATIVELY AND TO SAY WHEN WE HAVE PROBLEMS THE THE LAST THING WE'RE GOING TO DO IS BE DEFENSIVE ON HIGH DOUBLE IF WE HAVE ISSUES WE'RE GONNA LET YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE. AND WE GET A WET. PIECE BY PIECE TO SELL THEM -- I THINK THAT THE KEY THERE IS A LOT OF EXPECTATION -- FROM COMMUNITY MEMBERS FROM THE REGULATED COMMUNITY FROM ALL OF USE THAT WE GET THIS RIGHT AND I'M COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE ALL THAT WE DO EXACTLY THAT -- SO WITH THAT I'M I'M HAPPY TO ENTERTAIN ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU APPRECIATE YOUR FRANKNESS ON THIS ISSUE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS DOCTOR QUIRK -- CONGRATULATIONS AND CONDOLENCES. THE TSC IS GOING TO REQUIRE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MANAGEMENT SKILL AND EXPERTISE AND I'M HOPING YOU WILL -- DECIDE ON A ON A THE DIRECTOR OF THAT AREA SOON. SHOW IT. THE PROBLEM ONE OF THE MAIN PROBLEMS IS TIMELINESS WHETHER IT'S ON PERMITTING HAZARDOUS WASTE SITES CLEAN UP. OR IN THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM THAT WE DISCUSSED A LITTLE WHILE AGO. AND WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND. VERY WELL WHAT IT IS THAT PREVENTS US FROM BEING TIMELY. IT -- IT'S LIKELY THAT RESOURCES IS SOME OF THE PROBLEM BUT PROBABLY NOT ALL OF IT AND WE JUST NEED TO HEAR FROM YOU. AND FROM THE DIRECTOR OF DTS SEE WHEN THAT APPOINTMENT IS MADE. WHAT ALL THE ROAD BLOCKS ARE WHAT IS KEEPING THINGS FROM HAPPENING MORE QUICKLY AND TO WHAT EXTENT? OF PERHAPS WE NEED TO CHANGE THE REGULATION WHO WORK UNDER OR GET YOU MORE RESOURCES -- I DON'T EXPECT YOU TO HAVE ANY OF THOSE HAVING BEEN IN CHARGE FOR ABOUT TWO WEEKS -- BUT I'M HOPING YOU WILL GET THOSE TO US IN IN IN. AS SOON AS YOU CAN. I CAN PROVIDE SOME KIND OF EXPLANATION OF I THINK. WHAT'S ENTAILED I MEAN. SO FOR INSTANCE WITH OFTEN SITES IN CALIFORNIA IS NINE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SITES THAT HAVE KNOWS -- RESPONSIBLE PARTY -- THAT HAVE NOT BEEN CHARACTERIZED EFFECTIVELY -- THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE TOXIC IMPACT IS ON COMMUNITY SAYS. REALLY IT'S THINKING ABOUT SYSTEMS -- SYSTEMS THAT WORKS HAS HAD A WE CHARACTERIZE A SITE IN TIME TO TOXICITY IN TIMES OF HUMAN HEALTH EXPOSURES IMPOSSIBLE HE'S. HAD WE DO THAT HOW DO WE THEN MAKE SURE ALL THAT THAT CHARACTERIZATION IS SCIENTIFICALLY RIGOROUS. AND THEN DO WE HAVE THE CONTRACTS THE PEOPLE IN PLACE TO DO THE CLEAN UPS IN A TIMELY WAY WHERE WE HAVE TIME LINES THAT. OFF. VETTED FAST BE FULL AT I MEAN THE MOST FRUSTRATING THING FOR ANY COMMUNITY MEMBER. IS OVER PROMISING AND UNDER DELIVERING IT'S JUST UNACCEPTABLE WE NEED TO HAVE WHEN WE TELL SOMEONE THIS IS WHAT IS GOING TO BE CLEANED OUT AND THIS IS HOW MUCH IT'S GOING TO COST. NEEDS TO BEAR VERY CLOSE REAL RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO THINGS -- IN TIMES OF LEADERSHIP -- THE THE THREE OF US SPEND A LOT OF TIME EACH DAY ON THIS WILL ALL INVESTED IN THE MANAGEMENT -- AND ALL THOSE MEREDITH -- DOCTOR WILLIAMS IS ACTING I'M FULLY IMPAIRING HAD TO TAKE THE ACTIONS SHE NEEDS -- EVERY DAY WE COUNT WICKS -- AT THE SAME TIME -- JUST TO BE VERY FRANK I'M WITH YOU I I SPEND A LOT OF I SPENT TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX YEARS IN THIS SPACE DURING THIS WHACK -- WE NEED TO GET. WE NEED TO GET. THE TIAS SEE TO A POINT OF HEALTH BEFORE WE CAN GET SOMEONE WHO WOULD WANT TO TAKE THE JOB THAT WE WOULD WANT -- BECAUSE RIGHT NOW. WHEN I'VE SCANNED THE PEOPLE THAT I KNOW I'M YOU KNOW THAT LIKE IT'S A IN A CRISIS POINTS THAT WE NEED TO GET IT BACK TO A TO A MODICUM OF HEALTH WITH PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT AND AND FAST AND FOREMOST AS WORK IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE? AS YOU HIT DOING INDEPENDENT OLD AT TO GET THE NUMBERS STRAIGHT WAVY IF WE CAN'T TELL YOU IF THE NUMBERS WE GIVE YOU ON STRUCTURAL DEFICIT CHANGE. WE LOSE ALL YOUR CONFIDENCE WE LOSE THE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE RELEASE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS CONFIDENT SO. THAT'S WHY WE ARE SO GRATEFUL FOR THIS HEARING TODAY BECAUSE WE NEED YOU TO BE WITH US IN LOCK STEP TO SAY THESE NUMBERS. YOU CAN TRUST AND THIS IS WHY AND TO SHOW YOU THE BACKGROUND THE STUFF WHAT THAT WENT INTO THOSE NUMBERS SO -- FISCAL HEALTH IS NUMBER ONE THE SECOND REALLY IS. EXPENDITURES WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT WAS SPENDING IN THE DIFFERENT SPECIAL ACCOUNTS. I WANT TO MAKE SURE ALL -- THAT. THAT'S A LINED WITH STATUE WITH THE NEEDS OF COMMUNITY THAT THERE IS AN WHAT THAT AND THAT THE WHAT WE DOING -- FRANKLY AT HIS TO SOME PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT PLANTHAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING THE WORK. REALIZE THAT THEY NEED TO STEP UP ALL STEP OUT -- BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT LACK THAT THAT WE JUST HAVE. TO WE HAVE TO REALIZE THE COMMUNITIES FACING THIS BUTTON -- FEEL THAT BUTTON DAY IN DAY OUT. AND YOU KNOW CLEANUPS THAT TAKE A LONG TIME YOU KNOW AS THE STATEMENT WITH JUSTICE -- JUSTICE DELAYED IS JUSTICE DENIED AND AND MANY OF THE COMMUNITIES FEEL THAT SO. WE WILL HAVE TO BE TRANSPARENT WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON THE AUTHORITIES WE CURRENTLY HAVE DEAL POINT SENATE -- I DON'T KNOW IF WE NEED NEW WITH ALREADY I WANT TO MAKE CAU EXERCISING A CURRENT AUTHORITY EFFECTIVELY BEFORE WE ASK THE NEW ONES. AND I WANTED TO ALSO INTRODUCE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. BRIAN DOLLY WHO JUST CAME IN. AND SENATOR STERN. THANK YOU FOR THAT RESPONSE SENATOR WIECKOWSKI. ONYOUR THIRD PRONG AND THE COMMITMENT TO DEVELOP A PLAN CAN YOU GIVE US A TIME LINE ON THAT. WHAT DO YOU THINK THE THREE OF YOU CAN? WHAT'S YOUR THOUGHT RIGHT NOW AS HOW LONG IT'S GOING. TO TAKE TO DEVELOP THAT. THAN TIME TO FISCAL HEALTH YOU'LL HEAR FROM BOTH MEREDITH IN FRENCH AS A KIND OF WHERE WE'RE AT WHERE WE'RE GOING I'M. WE'VE MADE SOME KEY HIGHER AS SAID PRINCE SINCE WE'VE NEVER HAD A CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER -- EXCEPT FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME -- WE JUST APPOINTED A CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER -- I THINK JUSTICE IS A VERY GENERAL COMING WITHIN THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT BUT THERE'S OFTEN A PREFERENCE ON JUST GETTING THE WORK DONE AS OPPOSED TO HOW THE WORK GETS DONE. AND UNLESS WE HAVE THE FINANCIAL UNDERPINNINGS THE ADMINISTRATIVE. UNDERPINNINGS TO SUPPORT THE WAY OVERSIGHT ALL LEADING CONTRACTS TO MAKE SURE THE COMPANIES ARE DOING WHAT WE WANT. I'M PAYING YOU KNOW THE WAGES NECESSARY ALL THOSE THINGS -- THAT WAS SPENDING A LOT OF TIME FOCUSING ON I THINK -- FRENCH AS HE CAN GIVE YOU A THAT A STATEMENT ON THE LIKE WHEN SHE THINKS HE CAN GET THAT BACK WE GETTING THAT QUICKER THAN I THOUGHT -- ON TIME TO FISCAL HEALTH IN TERMS OF WORKLOAD MODELS -- AND UNDERSTANDING WITH CLARITY WHAT IT IS THAT I STOPPED DO AND HOW THAT RELATES TO THESE FUNDS -- THAT THAT WILL BE PROBABLY FOUR TO SIX MONTHS BEFORE WE CAN HAVE A CLEAR SENSE OF HOW ALL THOSE THINGS COME TOGETHER POT. WITHIN OUR GOAL IS IS WITHIN A YEAR. IS TACK TO HAVE FISCAL HEALTH -- TO AND WE WILL WE MAY NOT BE HEALTHY IN TIMES OF DAY HEY MAY STILL BE DEFICITS BUT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND. YOU KNOW WHAT THE SOURCE OF THOSE DEFICITS ARE WALK ADDITIONAL REVENUE WOULD DO IN TIMES OF CLEAN UP -- JUST BY WAY OF EXAMPLE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL -- MY THE JURISDICTION THAT I HELPED OVERSEE HAVE IS THE ADMINISTRATOR OF REGION NINETY PA OVERSAW ARIZONA NEVADA HAWAII CALIFORNIA AND THE PACIFIC ISLANDS AND CALIFORNIA HAD THE SMALLEST OFTEN CLEAN UP FRONT OF ALL THOSE STATES -- SO JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF SCALE -- NEVADA'S CLEANUP OFTEN CLEANUP FUND WAS LODGED IN CALIFORNIA SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE WAY WE DESIGN -- AND PRIORITIZE SITES THAT HAVE NO RESPONSIBLE PARTY THAT'S AN ISSUE -- AT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL FIND WAS EIGHT TAX -- AND THAT TAX -- EVENTUALLY BECAME PART OF THE GENERAL FUND SO THERE IS NO LONGER A SUPERFUND TAX -- ALL THE EPA CLEAN UPS -- IS PAID FULL FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S GENERAL FUND -- AND IF YOU WANT TO DO THIS WHAT WELL AND YOU DON'T WANT TO GO BACK AND HAVE TO CLEAN UP AGAIN WHICH IS THE COMMENT WHEN I WAS MEETING WITH COMMUNITIES WHY DOES IT TAKE SO LONG WHY DO WE NEED THE SCIENCE TO BE SO RIGOROUS. IT'S BECAUSE HE'S A VERY NASTY TOXIC CHEMICALS THAT SYSTEM BIOACCUMULATE. FULL DECADES IF NOT CENTURIES AND IF WE DON'T CLEAN THEM UP PROPERLY WILL HAVE TO GO BACK AND DO IT LATER. SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE MONEY TO SAY WHEN IT'S CLEAN. EVERYONE TRUSTS THAT CONCERT AT THE MOMENT THAT. THE JURY I THINK IS STILL OUT ON SOME OF DDS THESE PROJECTS -- LIKE I GUESS MY POINT THANK YOU THANK YOU AND I GUESS MY FOLLOW UP IS THAT WE KNOW THESE FEDERALS SUPERFUND SITES ARE GOING TO BECOME OUR RESPONSIBILITY AND AND SO YOU WERE YOU WERE PROBABLY. IN THE BEST POSITION LEAST KNOW WHERE ARE A THAT THEY EXIST. MORE COULD HAVE WHICH SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES EVEN IF WE CAME UP WITH THAT THAT WHAT'S WHAT THE A PLAN HERE AND THERE WAS SOME GENERAL FUND YOU COULD HAVE TO MAKE SOME. REALLY DIFFICULT DECISIONS I MEAN I'M HE PERCENT CLEANED UP YOU GOTTEN OVER NINE THOUSAND SITES THAT WE DON'T EVEN KNOW THE TAXI THE OF THOSE IN AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE BODIES AND DON'T HAVE THE FUNDS YOU COULD HAVE TO SAY. AND I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS WORKS BUT YOU SAY WE'RE GONNA STOP THIS CLEAN UP WHICH GETS A WHOLE GROUP OF PEOPLE SCREAMING AT PASSED THE PUBLIC HEARING BUT THEN AT LEAST EVALUATE AND DO THE ASSESSMENT OF OUR THESE NINE THOUSAND SITES. SUPER SERIOUS SERIOUS. NINE AND AND WE DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION MENTIONED YOU DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION AND THAT SEEMS TO BE SCARY WHEN WE HAVE THIS. THIS GREAT WAVE OF NEW FEDERAL SITES THAT ARE GOING TO BE. DELIVER TO OUR DOORSTEP AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN GIVE US SOME INSIGHT ON HOW YOU PRIORITIZE THAT MASSIVE CHALLENGE JUST TO IDENTIFY WHAT THE SITES ARE SO THAT THE PUBLIC IN. THE LEGISLATURE IN IN THE DEPARTMENT KNOW WHAT THE THE COURSE WORK IS. I I WOULD NEVER WANT TO STOP THE CLEAN UP HALF WAY THROUGH I MEAN ONCE WE COMMIT TO CLEANING SOMETHING UP I THINK WE OWE IT TO EVERYONE. INCLUDING I'M SIDING WITH WITH WITH YOU AND THE PUBLIC TO MAKE SURE WE FINISH CLEANING IT UP IN TERMS OF THE THE LARGER LIST OLD LET ME DEAL WITH THE THE SUPERFUND QUESTION FAST SO -- WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PUTS A SITE ON THE NATIONAL PRIORITIES LIST WHICH IS THE SUPERFUND LIST -- TO COMMITMENT TO MADE BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN A LETTER. THAT THE GOVERNOR -- NOT THIS COMING UP THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT GOVERNANCE OF SIGNED SENSE OF THE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF THE ON GOING OUT OF THE OF THE CLEANUP ITSELF -- AND THEN OFF TO TEN YEARS TO PAY THE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE -- SO THERE'S A TWO SEPARATE COSTS IN THE PAST TEN YEARS WE HAVE A IN THE OUT YEARS WE HAVE OF A FULL OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT PROJECTED -- EXPENDITURES IN THAT CATEGORY THEY ARE COMING TO GO UP SIGNIFICANTLY AND WE HAVE A LEGAL OBLIGATION TO PAY THOSE -- SO. THE THESE ON ALL KIND OF WISHLISTS THIS IS I HAVE TO WE WE HAVE -- TO BECAUSE THEY CLEAN UP STANDARDS THAT WE HAVE OBLIGATED OURSELVES TO IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- JUST. AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE IRON MOUNTAIN MINE -- WHICH IS ON THE SACRAMENTO RIVER IT WAS DEPOSITING MORE THAN A TON OF TOXIC MATERIALS INTO THE SACRAMENTO RIVER EVERY DAY. BEFORE THE CLEAN UP WAS DONE -- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT JUST TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT ONE OF THESE SITES COULD BE ONE OF THE NINE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND THEY SPEND MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS CLEANING UP THAT SIDE -- AND THE OPERATION A MAINTENANCE THAT SIDE IS GOING TO BE IN THE MILLIONS EVERY YEAR -- SAYS THAT JUST -- ONE I CAN GO DOWN THE LIST OF THE HUNDRED AND TEN THAT WE HAVE BACK EVERY COMMUNITY LIVES NEXT A SUPERFUND SITE. EVERY COMMUNITY THAT LIVES NEXT TO A A STATE HAZARDOUS WASTE SITE. THEY NEED TO KNOW -- THAT WE'VE CHARACTERIZED AT LEAST TO THE CAST THREE LEVEL. IT'S MATT -- THREE ITS PARKOUR ETHYLENE IT'S T. C. KIND OF WALK ON THE CONTAMINANTS THAT WITH LOOKING AT HOW WATER THE EXPOSURE PATHWAYS IS IN THE GROUND WATER IT'S VOLATILE ISING UP THROUGH INTO THE AIR IN THE BUILDING -- WE HAVE A VERY FOR INSTANCE FOR INSTANCE HAS MORE SUPERFUND SITES IN ANY OTHER COUNTY IN THE UNITED STATES. SO THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY -- HAD A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON GROUND WATER WHICH IS VERY VERY LOW LYING SAYS THE THAT CHEMICALS. IN. THE WATER VOLATILE EYES INTO THE AD AND GO INTO THE BUILDINGS -- COLD VAPOR INTRUSION AND BEG THEIR BUILDINGS ALL OVER SILICON VALLEY THAT WHERE THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT -- ISSUE -- WE WOULD JUST AT SANDERS IS AN AT FIELD LEBAR TREE -- IN SIMI VALLEY. THAT SHOULD BE A ONE OF THE ONLY PLACES I MEAN THE UNITED STATES WHERE THAT WAS A NUCLEAR MELTDOWN -- THAT WAS MORE THAN A MILLION GALLONS OF T. C. E. UM THAT WAS PUT INTO THE SOIL THAT SO. WE HAVE OUR WE'LL KNOW THIS WE HAVE OUR WORK CUT OUT FOR US -- THE EXPENSE I I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN ANY OF US CAN ANTICIPATE PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE LEGACY THAT WE HAVE -- FROM ALL THESE INDUSTRIES -- THAT TOOK PLACE BEING OF MAINLY FROM THE NINETEEN FIFTIES TO THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES IN CALIFORNIA AND SOME OF THEM DON'T HAVE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES. SAYS CHARACTERIZATION IS NUMBER ONE AND THEN A PLAN. WELL WE ALL WERE IN AGREEMENT I DON'T TO BE IN A DIFFERENT PLACE THAN ANYONE ELSE I WANT EVERYONE TO SAY THIS IS THE LAST THIS MAKES SENSE WE'VE LOOKED AT IT WE DONE OUR DUE DILIGENCE. AND WE TRY TO PRIORITIZE IT -- SENATOR BASED ON THOSE RISK FACTORS UNKNOWN AND AND NOT MAKING UP OUR OWN. USING USING SCIENCE IT IS ALREADY OUT OF THAT -- AND AND STICKING TO THAT MISSION UNTIL WE CLEAN IT UP. THANK YOU SOBRE -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA. THANK YOU I DON'T HAVE A QUESTION BUT A COMMENT AS YOU'RE GOING TO BE LEAVING BUT I HAVE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS FOR COLLEAGUES LEADER -- WE PASSED AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY THREE WHICH CREATED THE BATTERY FEE -- AND WE MADE A PROMISE HERE AND WITH A BIPARTISAN PROMISE OF THE LEGISLATURE NUMBERS WORK ON THAT TO THE COMMUNITY -- HOW THOSE FUNDS FOR GOING TO BE USED WE HAVE NOW SEEN MULTIPLE BUDGET ALLOCATIONS WHERE IT'S BEING USED AS BUDGET GIMMICKS? ALONG SO IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET. WE TOOK -- ONE POINT TWO MILLION TO REPAY THE TIRE BY LOAN. WE APPROPRIATE ONE POINT TWO MILLION TO THE H. W. CA FUNDS WE APPROPRIATED TEN MILLION TO REPAY. A LOAN A GENERAL FUND LOAN WE SAW THAT AGAIN IN IN THIS BUDGET AND WHILE THERE WAS A VICTORY LAP THAT WAS DONE WHEN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WAS RELEASED IN JERRY. THAT EX THAT WAS GETTING AN INFORMATIONAL FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS RATING THAT FINE WAS AGAIN FOR OTHER THINGS. AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT AS WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS. WE CREATED A FINE WITH THE PROMISE TO THE COMMUNITY AND THERE'S LIKE A TRUST AND AS LONG AS THAT FUND IS BEING SEEN IN OTHER WAYS WERE COSTLY VIOLATING THAT TRUST AND THE COMMUNITY OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE FRUSTRATED AND UPSET WITH THE PROCESS TO CLEAN UP AND I TELL -- THIS IS. YOU KNOW WE ARE LEARNING HAVE PATIENCE ON THE GROUND AND THEN THEY SAID OKAY MAYBE ONLY TO DO THAT BUT WHY DO YOU KEEPING THIS FIND -- WHEN WE FINALLY FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO IT RIGHT EVER GONNA HAVE ALL THE MONEY WE NEEDING YES TO CLEAN THEM HAS BEEN SLOW OR SPENDING THE MONEY HAS BEEN SO AND I WOULD LIKE IT TO BE? BUT IN VERY WE KEEP SAYING WE'RE GETTING BETTER AND BETTER AT IT EVERY DAY SO THIS'LL -- YOU KNOW GET PAST AND WILL BE USING THAT MONEY FASTER IS THAT MONEY GOING TO BE THERE. ON AND SUCH AS WANT TO MAKE SURE AS WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS WERE NOT RATING OF FUND WERE NOT BREAKING THAT PROMISE THAT THAT PROMISE THAT US AS LEGISLATORS MADE. TO EACH OTHER AND TO THE CONSTITUENCIES COMMUNITIES -- IT WE HAVE A LOAN I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE NEED TO BE PAYING THAT LOW ENOUGH NOT TO THE STATE OF A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLAR WHY AREN'T WE DOING THAT AGAIN WHEN THE CLEANUP IS DONE. WE HAVE AT LEAST TEN THOUSAND HOMES FROM BACKSIDE. TO CLEAN UP WE DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE -- WE TOOK MONEY FOR PARKWAYS AND WE SAID OKAY WE'RE GONNA TAKE SIX POINT FIVE MILLION FOR FOR THE PARK WAYS TO CLEAN UP. FROM THE LEAD ACID BATTERY FUND -- BUT THEN WE TOOK AN ADDITIONAL SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS AND SO WE TOOK THIS VICTORY LAP FOR THE PARKWAYS. BUT THE ONLY RATED IT WOULD SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS AS A LIST THAT PLAYING THESE GAMES WITH EACH OTHER AND WITH THE CONSTITUENCIES AND AND THE BUDGET. AND SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR THAT -- I'M NOT WILLING TO TAKE THAT VICTORY LAP BUT THE GOVERNOR ON THAT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND I THINK WE NEED TO REVISIT THAT. OF HOW WE'RE USING THESE DOLLARS. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS AT THIS POINT CENTER STONE THANK YOU FIRST OF ALL -- SECRETARY BLOOM FELT WELCOME TO THE ARENA WHERE WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE YEAR ROUND VERY IMPRESSED WITH THEIR CREDENTIALS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU -- THE TOXIC SUBSTANCE CONTROL ACCOUNT GENERATES -- REVENUE FROM TAXES IS ASSESSED ON ALL BUSINESSES BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT ALL BUSINESSES CREATE ENVIRONMENTAL WASTE. WHICH WE KNOW ISNOT TRUE BUT THAT'S THE THE NATURE OF THE OF THE REVENUE STREAMS. AND MOST THESE TAX REVENUES OR USE -- FOR POST CLEAN UP AND AND COST OF SUPERS FUNDS SITES. BUT OF THERE'S A QUESTIONS BASED ON WHAT I HEARD FROM MY COLLEAGUES IN WHAT I'VE OBSERVED IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT -- IS IN DISARRAY -- INABILITY TO CLEAR PERMIT BLOW SHARKS FINAL SIR FISCAL UNCERTAINTY. ON FUND RESERVES -- AND I SHIP SAME CONCERNS AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA -- ALSO SHARE THE SAME CONCERNS WITH SENATOR -- WHITE KASKI ABOUT. PRIORITIZING -- THROUGH QUICK QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS THE THE NATURE OF THE SEVERITY OF THE TOXIC SITES. THAT EXIST IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE AGENCIES TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY AND LONG TERM STABILITY OF THE DTS SEE -- MY CONCERN IS A WE HAVE A VERY FRAGILE ECONOMY WITH OUR BUSINESSES THAT ARE. OVERTAXED AND STRESSED -- THERE WAS A RECENT -- STUDY THE POLL WAS TAKEN SAID CONSIDERING LEAVING THE STATE AND AND MANY OF THOSE ARE FOR BUSINESS REGULATIONS AND TAX REASONS. SO -- IS THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSING ANY GENERAL FUND UTILIZATION FOR URGENT. CLEANUP -- GIVEN THE STATE'S TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND PURPOSE AND IF THE DEPARTMENT IS NOT OPERATING EFFICIENCY. WHICH CREATES MORE MORE COSTS. SHOULD WE NOT PENALIZE THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND ACCEPT THE FACT THAT WERE RUNNING AN EFFICIENT BASED ON OUR OWN LEADERSHIP IN THE DEPARTMENT. AND LET YOU SOME OF OUR GENERAL FUND RESERVES TO TO FIX THE PROBLEM INSTEAD OF GOING BACK TO THE WELL. OF THE BUSINESSES THAT -- SUSTAINER CALIFORNIA. SINCE THE DAYS JUST GENERAL COMMENTS -- AS IT RELATES TO THIS. I'VE I THINK OUR GOAL TO THE EXTENT THAT WE GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW THESE FEES AS A GENERATED -- AND IS TOO BAD M. MARY. THE THE ENTITIES GENERATING A LOT OF WAYS TO THE MORE YOU GENERATE THE MORE TOXIC IT IS THE MORE YOU PAY. AS OPPOSED TO AT THE MOMENT THAT ENTITIES THAT DON'T GENERATE IT SEEMS AS FOR MIKE HAS THREE LOOK ANY HAZARDOUS WASTE THE PAYING IN. TO THE FUND SO I THINK AS WE MOVE FORWARD DOT OUR GOAL IS IS TO REALLY -- THE ANYWAY WE GET YOU KNOW A HUNDRED YEARS FROM NOW PEOPLE LOOK BACK AT TODAY. DEAD MAN NUMBER ONE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE MAKE SURE WE NOT PUTTING YOU TOXIC MATERIAL INTO THE GROUND AND SO REDUCING THE AMOUNT THAT WE GENERATE. SHOULD BE OUT OUR NUMBER ONE GOAL AND ONE OF THE WAYS OF DOING THAT IS MAKING SURE ALL THAT THE PEOPLE THAT PRODUCE THE MOST WASTE PAID THE MOST AMOUNT OF MONEY -- I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY GET TRANSLATED INTO. INTO SOME FEE SYSTEM BUT SADLY THAT'S THE APPROACH I'M AND THE HAZARDOUS WASTE ACCOUNT -- IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE TAKING. A FEW BITES OF THE SAME PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND IT IT DOES DEFINITELY UP A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR EFFICIENCY IN THE WAY THAT WE DO THAT -- AVERAGE I WOULD SAY THAT -- TO ASSEMBLYMAN ASSEMBLY WOMAN GARCIA'S PINE -- I THINK IT'S BEEN REALLY HARD TO DTS SEE TO STAND UP AND SAY. THIS IS WHAT WE THINK THIS IS WHY WE HAVE THESE THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE BECAUSE IT'S BEEN IN CRISIS MODE AND SO WE NEED TO GET TO THE NEXT PLACE WHERE IT CAN CLEARLY ARTICULATE THIS IS WHAT OUR NEEDS ARE. AND AND PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT AND TAKE IT SERIOUSLY AND AND TRUSTED. AND IN THE ABSENCE OF THAT -- I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT PARTICULAR ACCOUNT -- BUT I CAN'T. TO WHERE THERE'S AN AGENCY THAT SAYS NO WE NEED THIS MONEY TO DO THIS THING SLIGHTLY IN THE US EPA CONTEXT -- WE WOULD FIGHT FOR THOSE BUDGET LINES -- AND PEOPLE REALLY UNDERSTOOD AND CONGRESS MEN AND WOMEN THAT WE SPOKE TO UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF SUPER FUND ALLOCATIONS AND WHERE THAT WENT TO AND HOW IT SPED UP THE CLEAN UP AND YOU KNOW THE THE THE OTHER OBVIOUS. QUESTION IS MORE MONEY SHOULD LEAD TO SPEEDY OF MORE EFFECTIVE CLEAN UPS AND SAID THAT THEY NEED TO BE A CORRELATION BETWEEN THOSE THINGS -- SO -- WE DO HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO -- I AM PRESENTLY. OF THE BELIEF THAT MANAGEMENT IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TOOL -- WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING HOW WE'RE DOING AT HOW WE'RE PAYING FOR IT AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK IN THE LAST YEAR'S ABOUT STRUCTURAL CHANGES FOR ME. LET'S WORK OUT HOW WE'RE DOING WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW DO IT. AS WELL AS WE CAN AND THEN LOOK AT THE STRUCTURAL ISSUES -- AND I AM ACCOUNTABLE TO THE USE OF THE PUBLIC TO MAKE SURE WE'RE GETTING THIS DONE AND IT'S A PRIORITY FOR ME -- BECAUSE OF ALL THE THINGS THAT WE DO IF YOUR IN A COMMUNITY LIVING NEXT TO HAZARDOUS WASTE FACILITY -- LED TO CIVILITY IT'S INTOLERABLE AND YOU WANTED DEALT WITH AND THAT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS GOVERNMENT -- AND REBUILDING TRUST IS AT A HUGE PRIORITY OF OF MINE. MISTER SECRETARY DESERVE ONE FINAL FOLLOW UP -- I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THE THE THE FUNDING AND THE NEXUS -- TO RELEASING HAZARDOUS WASTE AND THE FEES THAT ARE THAT ARE GENERATED -- ANOTHER THING I HOPE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO ENTERTAIN AS THE THE NEW SECRETARY IS -- EFFICIENCIES YOU'VE YOU MENTIONED THAT A LITTLE BIT -- WE JUST YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR PROP -- ONE REVENUES IN PART OF THE PROP ONE WAS TO FIND EFFICIENCIES A CALTRANS ANOTHER TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND EFFICIENCIES WERE FOUND SO I HOPE THAT YOU WILL BE. EMBRACING TECHNOLOGY AND AND MANAGEMENT STYLES THAT WILL. SHOW TO OUR TAXPAYERS SAID YES THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUE THAT AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SWORN TO PROTECT AS WE TAKE THESE OFFICES AND WE DEPEND ON YOU AND CERTAINLY THE STAFF OF THE DEPARTMENT. TO ENSURE THAT THE MONEY IS SPENT WISELY S I I HOPE THAT YOU'LL YOU'LL -- LEON SILICON VALLEY THAT. YOU YOU MENTIONED IS A IS A NIGHT AS FOR A LOT OF THIS ENVIRONMENTAL -- TOXICITY -- BUT ALSO TAP THEIR TECHNOLOGY -- IN A WAY IN WHICH WE CAN RUN THE DEPARTMENT MRE EFFICIENTLY WHICH MEANS IT'S GOING TO BE RUN LESS EXPENSIVELY. REFRIGERATOR YOUR PRESENCE I'M A BIG FAN OF LEAN. SIX SIGMA SO THE WELL I MEAN AD TELLING MISTER SECRETARY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR RESPONSE WE HAVE THREE PEOPLE WAITING IN THE IN THE QUEUE -- I I WANTED TO COMMENT ON THE LEVEL OF SPECIFICITY ANSWERING QUESTIONS. ABOUT GIVEN THE FACT THAT YOU'VE ONLY BEEN ON THE JOB FOR A COUPLE WEEKS -- AND COMPLIMENT YOU ON THAT I WANT TO POINT OUT TO THOSE WHO ARE GOING TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ASK QUESTIONS -- THAT WE HAVE. PEOPLE HERE WHO ARE IN THE TRENCHES AND PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT -- MORE ABLE TO ANSWER SOME OF THOSE VERY DETAILED -- QUESTIONS SO JUST BEAR THAT IN MIND AS YOU PROCEED -- WE HAVE SENATOR STERN FOLLOWED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER ASSEMBLY MEMBER DOLLY AND FONG. THANK YOU MISTER. AND WELCOME MR SECRETARY. HIGH YOU KNOW IT THE HE SEES THIS WELL VERSED BECAUSE HE'S DONE A JOB LIKE THIS BEFORE RUNNING EPA REGION NINE WAS NO SMALL TASK SO WE'RE HOPING YOU BRING SOME OF THAT SAME TACKY MEN AND DISCIPLINE. TO THIS AGENCY AND ALL THE DEPARTMENTS WITHIN IT SO -- IT IS NOT EASY BUT I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING I'VE HEARD THIS MORNING AND THANKS ALREADY FOR GETTING STARTED WE KNOW THAT -- YOU KNOW ONE OF THE SITES YOU IS WERE MADE AND HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN FOLLOWED THROUGH ON HIS SANTA SUSANNA. AS YOU SAID MILLION GALLONS A TCP COMMITMENT SPEND TWENTY TEN THANKS FOR VISITING THE SITE AND ALSO FOR TRYING TO HOLD THE FEDS ACCOUNTABLE SHOULD WANT TO GET INTO THAT DYNAMIC A LITTLE BIT WITH YOU HERE JUST. YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THIS COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP WE'VE GOT WITH. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHERE THEY ARE OFTEN A RESPONSIBLE PARTY -- IN THIS CASE DEPARTMENT ENERGY AND NASA WHO BUILT OUR ROCKETS THAT SPILLED OUT ALL THAT T. C. E. ALONG WITH BOEING FOR THEIR CORPORATION PRIOR TO THAT. WERE SOME OF THE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES ALREADY IDENTIFIED WE MADE COMMITMENTS IN. TWENTY TEN LOOKS LIKE THE FEDS ARE TRYING TO FALL BACK. AND BREAK THEIR COMMITMENTS RIGHT NOW THE DEPARTMENT ENERGY PUT OUT A PRETTY WEAK NY BUT NOW SIS. WHICH I APPRECIATE THAT IDT. SENT THAT LETTER BACK IN DECEMBER SAYING THIS DOESN'T LOOK LIKE YOU'RE MEETING YOUR YOUR YOUR CONSENT ORDERS YOUR YOUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO CLEAN UP -- BUT HOW DO YOU SEE THINGS PROCEEDING AT SANTA SUSANNA BOTH FROM -- DTS SEE ABOUT AND YOU KNOW WE WERE SUPPOSED TO I THINK THE CLEANUP TIMELINE WAS TWENTY SEVENTEEN BACK IN TWENTY TEN AND IT'S TWENTY NINETEEN AND WE HAVEN'T EVEN GOT STARTED SO. I DON'T EXPECT YOU HAVE A FULL ANSWER RIGHT NOW AND I KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE. YOU'RE STILL MIDWAY THROUGH YOUR SEQUEL PROCESS AND YOUR ENVIRONMENTAL ANNOUNCES INCOMPLETE SO MAYBE YOU KNOW -- THE ACTING DIRECTOR ALSO COULD COMMENT THEIR WAY AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME BUT I JUST WANTED AT A HIGH LEVEL -- YOU KNOW THE FEDS ARE ON THE HOOK FOR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A COSTS AND THEY'RE TRYING TO GET OUT OF IT COMPLETELY -- WE MEANWHILE HAVE TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE AND PRIVATE PARTIES SO. ANY JUST INITIAL -- TAKE ON WHAT CAN BE DONE. SHAW I'M OUT OF A GIVE A VERY INITIAL TAKE -- AND IT'S A COMPLETE MESS -- AND YOU KNOW THE LEVEL OF TOXICITY THE HISTORY THAT IS WHEN YOU'RE ON SITE IS JUST. DEPRESSING I MEAN EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK THERE WAS -- FLAGRANT VIOLATIONS OF EVEN WHAT THEY KNEW BACK IN THE DAY -- ANOTHER CASE I WORK DONE IN MY LAST JOB WAS URANIUM MINING ON THE NAVAJO NATION -- THAT WAS FOR THE SAME EXACT EFFORT TO BUILD -- WEAPONS FOR THE COLD WAR -- AND IT WAS IMPORTANT WHAT BUT IT IT WITHOUT IT HAD A HUGE TOXIC LEGACY SO IT'S HAND THIS IS ANNA -- JUST FOR THE THE OTHER MEN THAT SAYS THEM THREE PARTY SAID NASA -- THE POT OF ENERGY AND BOEING. AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS AN AGREEMENT CALLED OLD ON CONSENT. WITH THE TO FEDERAL AGENCIES IN THAT ORDER IS TO CLEAN UP THE FACILITY TO BACKGROUND AND IT WAS INKED. BY STEPHEN TO THE NOBEL LAUREATE -- WHO'S THE HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY AT THE TIME AND NASA DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AND AND I WAS -- AT EPA THAT TIME IT'S IT'S NOT. IT DOESN'T GIVE DISCRETION TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THERE IS NO THIS IS WHAT THEY LIKE TO DO IT'S VERY CLEAR WHAT THEY NEED TO DO -- IT'S LEGALLY COMPELLING DOCUMENT THAT WE CAN GET COURTS TO HELP IN FALSE -- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES NOT WANT TO PAY. I'M AND IN MY EXPERIENCE IT USEPA -- WE WILL VERY UNPOPULAR BECAUSE WE WOULD HOLD OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES ACCOUNTABLE -- WE NEED AS A STATE ACCOUNT SHOW THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES TWO THINGS. ONE DOES WHAT IT SAYS IT WAS GONNA DO AND SECOND. CASE FOR WHAT IT SAYS IS GOING -- TO BUT YOU SAID IT'S IT'S GOING TO BE -- A STRUGGLE BECAUSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- ISN'T PRIORITIZING THESE KIND OF CLEAN UPS AND THEIR GOAL IS IF YOU HAVE A LESS STRINGENT CLEANUP STANDARDS. AND THIS MAKES SENSE TO ALL OF US YOU PAY LESS TO CLEAN IT UP. SAID THERE'S A DIRECT CORRELATION -- BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY PAY AND THE LEVEL OF CLEAN U WE RECEIVE -- AND THEN BOEING -- AS ANOTHER PORTION OF THE SITE AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY GET HIT TO THEIR OBLIGATIONS WHICH ALSO LEGALLY BINDING WITH US -- SAYS. ALL THAT REQUIRES LEGAL -- GOAL THAT REQUIRE AS BE PEOPLE KNOWING YOU KNOW THIS IS THIS IS THE BOTTOM LINE THAT PEOPLE KNOW THAT WE ARE IN IT WE ARE SERIOUS AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO WALK AWAY FROM THE PROJECT AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO ALLOW OTHERS TO WALK AWAY FROM THAT COMMITMENTS. THAT'S HARD TO DO WHEN. YOU KNOW T. SENATE -- SENATE DISTANCE COMMENTS -- WHERE IN DISARRAY WE HAVE BEEN IN DISARRAY WE WORKING EVERY DAY TO MAKE A DECISION TO MOVE THE AGENCY BACK INTO HEALTH? BACK INTO A PLACE WHERE RUNNING PROPERLY -- BUT RETOOLING WORKING OUT THE BUDGET IS AND HOLDING VERY LARGE SOPHISTICATED POLLUTERS ACCOUNTABLE IS REALLY DIFFICULT SO WE NEED TO PUT SOME STUFF BEHIND US WE NEED TO MOVE PAST THAT ERA OF DISARRAY. INTO A HERO ALL OF WE'VE GOT A FEW ISSUES THAT WAY SOLVING TOGETHER AT THIS IS WHAT THE THIS IS HOW WE DOING THEM AT THE SAME CLEAN IT UP -- WE MET WITH FAMILIES THAT LIVE AROUND THE SITE -- THIS MIGRATION OFFSITE FROM THAT FACILITY -- TO COMMUNITIES AND IT WAS REALLY -- EMOTIONALLY DEVASTATING. YES MOMS TALKING ABOUT THE YOUNG KIDS THAT HAVE CANCER -- AND YES IT DOES A VERY REAL AND PERSONAL FACE TO ALL THESE SITES AND WE WE KIND OF KNOW THAT AT THE SAME TIME. WE NEED TO BE RIGOROUS AND DISCIPLINED AND DILIGENT IN OUR APPROACH TO TO SOLVING AT THANKS. THREE DOLLARS. PAYMENT YOUR REAL QUICK -- SO YOU TALK ABOUT THE NINE THOUSAND SITES THAT ARE -- I GUESS THE OR FROM SITES WE COLUMN RIGHT. WHERE THEY OUT IN THE PROCESS OF THE BEEN? CATEGORIZED OF THEIR TOXICITY AND RATE AND THEN I'M ASSUMING A LOT OF THESE OUR BROWN FIELDS IN AREAS WHERE. THEY DID KNOW THERE WAS A PROBLEM. I JUST WOULD LIKE THAT -- TO DOCTOR WILLIAMS CAN AM -- AND FOR TO HAVE TO GO IN A SECOND BUT DOCTOR WILLIAMS AND A HAT TESTIMONY CANNOT TO THAT QUESTION -- I WOULD SAY THAT. MORE THAN A THIRD OF THEM -- DRY CLEANERS -- SAYS [inaudible] YOU KNOW. THE POPULAR ATHLETE THAT COMES OUT OF DRY CLEAN AS WHEN YOU LOOK AT SUPERFUND SITES -- IS ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE THINGS TO CLEAN UP -- GAS STATIONS AND OTHER THINGS THAT BROWN FIELDS THAT CAN HAVE BENEFICIAL ECONOMIC RE USE -- OBVIOUSLY A PRIORITY AND AND WE WOULD FOCUS ON THAT IS THAT YOU CAN TURN THEM AROUND CERTIFY THAT THEY CLEAN AND MOVE ON BUT LET'S HAVE MEREDITH IN A MINUTE CAN CAN ADDRESS THAT SPECIFIC QUESTION. SECRETARY NEEDS TO LEAVE EMINENTLY I THANK GOD I SEE STAFF -- WAITING ANXIOUSLY A MISTER FONG. BUT VERY BRIEF -- EDGE JUST ONE QUESTION -- COULD YOU HIGHLIGHT OR MAYBE YOUR STAFF WHAT THE DEPARTMENT IS DOING AS WHAT'S DOES THE STRUCTURE TO LOOK LIKE IS THERE AND REVIEW GOING ON COULD YOU SHOULD SUCH AS A MIGHT ON THAT. DEBT TO GREAT A GREAT QUESTION -- AND FRANCISCO WAS PREPARED TO TALK ABOUT THAT AND AND WILL -- I WOULD JUST SAY THAT. WE HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS RIGHT AND I I THINK OFTEN WE WERE AFRAID OF MAKING A DECISION IN ANY CONTEXT IN LIFE -- BECAUSE THESE A DIFFICULT DECISIONS YOU KNOW REAP HAVING A FACILITY THAT NO ONE LIKES AB. YEAH DELUDE DEALING WITH HAZARDOUS WASTE IN TWENTY NINETEEN IS IT'S TOUGH. MY ASSUMPTION -- AT USEPA WE WERE SUED EVERY OTHER DAY OF THE WEEK MY ASSUMPTION IS SOMEONE'S GOING TO SUE US SO LET'S JUST MAKE A DECISION TO MOVE ON AND ALLOW THAT PROCESS. TO MOVE FORWARD IF THEY DON'T TO US WE'VE MADE A TIMELY GOOD DECISION IF THEY DO WE JUST ACCEPT THAT SOME PART OF DOING BUSINESS WITH VERY CONTROVERSIAL. VERY COMPLEX SITES BUT I DON'T WANT IT ON US BY ONCE WE HAVE THE INFORMATION -- THE SCIENCE THE LAW. WE NEED TO MOVE THESE THINGS THROUGH MAKE THE DECISIONS MOVE ONTO THE NEXT THING -- BECAUSE WE ARE BEING DONE ANY OF IT IS THE REGULATED COMMUNITY BEING. WE ARE DEALING WITH THIS RIDICULOUS LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY WE ARE BECAUSE WE HAVE MORAL PAM IT'S ENOUGH BACKLOG AND WE LOOK LESS AND LESS. PROFESSIONAL TO USE SO MY COMMITMENT IS WILL MAKING DECISIONS MOVING ON AND TALKING MOVIE ON I HAVE TO GO BY I AS AS PARTNERS ON THIS ALBUM. I REALLY IF THERE ARE QUESTIONS WITH ALWAYS AVAILABLE TO TO ENGAGE IN A DISCUSSION ON HOW WITH THINKING ABOUT MOVING DE DST TOWARDS HEALTH HOW. YOU'LL THINKING IT CAN WORK -- AND DAY IN DAY OUT I'M ENGAGED -- I DON'T WANT TO BE MICROMANAGING BUT AT THE SAME TIME AND I'M GONNA BE DOING THIS EVERY DAY OF EVERY WEEK TO WE SOLD IT OUT. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT DOCTOR ARAMBULA CAN YOUR QUESTION WAIT. FOR YOU OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER SECRETARY WE APPRECIATE THE TIME SPENT THIS MORNING CAM TO LOOK FOR TING AGAINST SAN -- SO WILL PROCEED NOW WITH THAT TESTIMONY FROM MEREDITH WILLIAMS SO FOLLOWED BY FRANCESCA NAY GREEK AND SHAUN MARK. THE MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE. AND FOR YOUR SUPPORT IN HELPING DSE ACHIEVE THE MISSION TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS AND AT PEOPLE CALIFORNIA'S PEOPLE ENVIRONMENT FROM CHEMICAL ANOTHER HARM. AT THE RECENT GREEN CHEMISTRY HEARING WHICH MANY OF YOU HAD A CHANCE TO ATTEND I HAD A CHANCE TO SHARE. WITH YOU SOME OF HOW THE DEPARTMENT HAS IMPLEMENTED THOSE REGULATIONS USING SCIENTIFIC RIGOR. TRANSPARENCY PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT. SECOND SECRETARY BLUMENFELD HAS ASKED ME TO HELP LEAD DGSE DURING THIS TRANSITIONAL PERIOD. AND APPLY THE SAME PRINCIPLES TO THE REST OF THE DEPARTMENT. WE'VE DISCUSSED THE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES OF THE DTS HE FACES AND ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. TO ADDRESS THOSE CHALLENGES. THE DEPARTMENT'S CLEAN UP PERMITTING AND ENFORCEMENT WORK AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS SAFETY EFFORTS. VITAL TO THE STATE. A QUICK LOOK AT OUR THREE PROGRAM AREAS GIVES A SENSE OF THE SCOPE OF OUR WORK. MUCH WHICH IS NOT NEWS TO YOU -- SITE MITIGATION AND RESTORATION PROGRAM IS ACTIVELY OVERSEEING CLEAN UP OF LEAD PERK TRUCK TRICOLOR ETHYLENE HEXAVALENT CHROME LET CYANIDE AND HOPE. CHEMICALS. MUCH OF THIS ACTIVITY IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TWENTY TO PRIORITIZE SUPERFUND SITES AROUND THE STATE. OF THOSE. TWELVE SITES ARE LOCATED IN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES AS DEFINED UNDER CALIFORNIA CALLIN VIRUS SCREEN. AS MENTIONED WE EXPECT THE STATE'S OBLIGATIONS TO SUPPORT SUPER SUPER FUN REMEDIATION AND OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE TO TRIPLE. OVER THE NEXT THREE FISCAL YEARS. THE STATE'S CLEANUP EFFORTS NEED TO BE TIMELY AND EFFECTIVE. THEY NEED TO BE UNDERTAKEN BASED ON CLEANUP STANDARDS THAT ARE GROUNDED IN SOUND SCIENCE. AND THEY NEED TO BE CONDUCTED WITH MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENT. OF THE AFFECTED COMMUNITIES IN THE PLANNING AND EXECUTION OF OUR CLEANUPS. HAZARDOUS WASTE PERMITTING AND ENFORCEMENT. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN NINETY FIVE THOUSAND CALIFORNIA ENTITIES GENERATED ONE POINT FIVE MILLION TONS OF HAZARDOUS WASTE. THAT'S THAT WASTE WAS TRANSPORTED TO ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN FACILITIES AROUND THE STATE FOR TREATMENT STORAGE FOR DISPOSAL [inaudible] LAST YEAR. IN A THE TWENTY THREE CASES WERE INVESTIGATED BY THE DEPARTMENT RESULTING IN THREE EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN SETTLEMENTS AND TO CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS. PERMITTING AND ENFORCEMENT MUST BE CONSISTENT TRANSPARENT EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE. AND DTS HE MUST BE MINDFUL OF THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH PERMITTED FACILITIES ARE LOCATED AND HAZARDOUS WASTE IS TRANSPORTED WERE STORED. SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS. THOUSANDS OF CHEMICALS ON THE GREEN CHEMISTRY CANDIDATE CHEMICALS LIST. ARE USED IN TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS MEANING THAT RIGHT NOW THERE ARE EXPOSURES OF TO THESE CHEMICALS THROUGH MANUFACTURING USE AND DISPOSAL. THE CONTINUED USE OF THESE CHEMICALS GUARANTEES CONTINUE NEED FOR HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT SITE MITIGATION SO WE DO NEED TO BREAK THAT CYCLE. IT SEEMS INEVITABLE THAT EACH OF YOU HAS A STAKE IN DTS HE'S WORK A PERMITTED FACILITY IN YOUR DISTRICT AND ONGOING CLEAN UP A RECENT COMMUNITY MEETING. RELATED TO SOMETHING WE'RE WORKING ON SO THE PARENT WHY DO TSC MUST MEET ITS MISSION. TO KEEP CHEMICALS FROM MIGRATING INTO DRINKING WATER TO CLEAN UP STATES. TO CLEAN UP STATE SITE SLOW SO THAT THEY CAN BE PART OF THE SOLUTION TO OUR HOUSING PROBLEMS TO MAKE SURE THAT HAZARDOUS WASTE IS HANDLED PROPERLY. AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN IT'S NOT WE HOLD THOSE RESPONSIBLE. A THOSE RESPONSIBLE ACCOUNTABLE THROUGH EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT. AND TO DRIVE INHERENTLY SAFER CHEMICALS IN PRODUCT DESIGN AND EVENTUALLY BREAK THAT CYCLE THAT WE SEEM TO BE CAUGHT IN. DTS THESE CHALLENGES ARE WELL KNOWN AND HAVE BEEN ALREADY MENTIONED TODAY ORGANIZATIONAL TRAVELING SHOULD CHALLENGES TRANSPARENCY IN COMMUNICATIONS CHALLENGES. ACCOUNTABILITY FAILURES AND BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS. AMONG THOSE CHALLENGE THE MOST URGENT IS OUR FINANCIAL HEALTH. WITHOUT THAT WE CAN'T X. EXECUTE TOUR MAN REQUISITE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR NEGRI HAS TAKEN SIGNIFICANT STEPS TO ONE COVERS PROBLEMS WITH OUR REPORTING. AND TO RESTRUCTURE OUR FINANCIAL PROGRAM UNDER NEW LEADERSHIP. SHE ALSO WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. TO DEVELOP ACCURATE BUDGET NUMBERS THAT WE CAN PROVIDE WITH TO YOU TODAY. LAYING THE GROUNDWORK NECESSARY TO ADDRESS DTS HE'S BUDGETARY CHALLENGES AND DELIVER ON OUR MISSION. SHE WILL WALK YOU THROUGH EACH YES HE'S BUDGET AND THE STATUS OF OUR MAIN FUNDS. BASED ON THE PROGRESS UNDER HER LEADERSHIP. DGSE CAN BEGIN THE NECESSARY WORK TO ENGAGE WITH THE LEGISLATURE AN EXTERNAL STRAIGHT STAKEHOLDERS TO CREATE A SUSTAINABLE FUNDING MODEL. ALIGNED WITH STRATEGIC PRIORITIES. AS WE CONTINUE TO IMPROVE OUR FISCAL PRACTICES AND REPORTING WE WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH REGULAR UPDATES AND SEEK YOUR INPUT ON OUR EFFORTS. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND COMMITMENT AND MAKING SURE THE DTS SEE AFFECTED LEE PROVIDES PROTECTION. AGAINST TOXICS SUBSTANCES AROUND THE STATE. THANK YOU WHY DON'T WE PROCEED WITH THEM AS AN AGREE AND MISTER MARTIN AND THEN -- OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS IF THAT'S ALRIGHT WITH EVERYONE WELCOME. OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS WITH YOU DTS SEES BUDGET IN THE STATUS OF OUR MAJOR FUNDS. AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE FEES THAT SUPPORT OUR CORE PROGRAMS. A AS THE SECRETARY INDICATED WE'VE MADE SOME SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IS BRING CLARITY AND TRANSPARENCY CHORE UND BALANCES OVER THE PAST SIX MONTHS DESPITE WELL KNOWN CHALLENGES. WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURE'S SUPPORT IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS WITH PROVIDING DTS C. THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN PROGRAM SERVICE LEVELS. HOWEVER WE ARE NOW FACING THE IMPACTS OF THE STRUCTURAL DEFICITS ON THE FUND BALANCES IN OUR MAIN FUNDS THE HAZARDOUS WASTE CONTROL ACCOUNT OR H. W. CA. AND THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACCOUNT OR TOSCA. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH REPORTING ACTUAL FUND BALANCES FOR SEVERAL YEARS. LIKE MANY OTHER DEPARTMENTS DTS ES STRUGGLED WITH TRANSITIONING TO FISCALE SINCE WE CONVERTED TO THE NEW SYSTEM IN THE FISCAL YEAR. FIFTEEN SIXTEEN CONSORTIUM FACTORS TO THE SITUATION INCLUDED THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR BUDGET AND ACCOUNTING PROCESS SEES. AS WELL AS A LACK OF SOPHISTICATION AND ACCOUNTING ACCU MEN IN DTS SEES ACCOUNTING PROGRAM. THAT WAS NECESSARY TO HANDLE TRANSISTOR TRANSITIONING FROM THE PREVIOUS ACCOUNTING AND BUDGET SYSTEM WHERE WE'VE BEEN OPERATING FOR DECORATE DECADES DIRECTLY TO FISCAL WITHOUT ANY OVERLAP FOR BACKUP SYSTEM. WE'VE TAKEN STEPS TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AND ARE CONFIDENT IN THE NUMBERS AND ARE FUN CONDITIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN VERIFIED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THESE STEPS INCLUDE WE HIRED AN OUT SUPPORT OUR TRANSITION EFFORTS WE PARTNER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO RECONCILE EACH A COUNTY PERIOD -- ACTUALLY STARTING WITH THE YEAR BEFORE WE TRANSITION TO FRISCO -- TO THE TO FIX THROUGH FISCAL YEAR. SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WE READ RECENTLY RE OREGON WERE REORGANIZED THE FISCAL SERVICES PROGRAM IN DTS SEE AN ESTABLISHED NEW LEADERSHIP OVER THE PROGRAM WITH EXTENSIVE BUDGETING AND ACCOUNTING EXPERIENCE. FINALLY WE ARE HIRING THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES OFFICE OF STATE AUDITS AND EVALUATION. PROGRAM WITH SPECIFIC EXPERTISE IN STATE ACCOUNTING PROGRAMS AND THE SCALE TO PERFORM A FULL AUDIT OF DTS HE'S ACCOUNTING PROCESS SEES AND FUND MANAGEMENT. OC IS SCHEDULED TO BEGIN THE AUDIT IN APRIL AND THEIR PRELIMINARY TIME LINE FOR ISSUING REPORT IS JULY. OF THIS YEAR. DTS THESE PROGRAMS ARE SUPPORTED BY MANY DIFFERENT FUNDS HOWEVER MOST OF THE CORE PROGRAM ACTIVITIES ARE FUNDED BY EACH W. CA AND TOSCA. AS YOU'RE AWARE THE NINETEEN TWENTY JAN TEN BUDGET INCLUDES A VERY LARGE ADJUSTMENT TO THE FISCAL YEAR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN FUND CONDITIONS FOR THESE ACCOUNTS. FROM WHAT WAS REPORTED IN THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND ACTING GALLEY. FOR EXAMPLE. IN THE JANUARY TEN BUDGET WE REPORTED THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN ENDING FUND BALANCE IS AN H. W. C. EIGHT TO BE APPROXIMATELY TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS. WHERE IS IN THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET IT WAS REPORTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS? BECAUSE WE WERE NOT YET CURRENT FISCALES DTS SEE HAS BEEN REPORTING ESTIMATES FOR ITS YEAR AND FUND BALANCES SINCE TRANSITIONING TO FISCALE. WHEN WE IDENTIFY THE ABNORMALLY HIGH FUND BALANCES PASS FALL WHILE CLOSING FISCAL YEAR SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN WE PARTNERED WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO CONDUCT A RECONCILIATION OF EACH MONTH? AS I INDICATED. DURING THAT RECONCILIATION DTS HE DETERMINED THAT ONE OF THE CONSULTANTS WE BROUGHT ON BOARD TO ASSIST US WITH THE TRANSITION SOUGHT TO CORRECT A CONVERSION ERROR AND INADVERTENTLY POSTED A SEVENTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR CREDIT TO AGE TO BE CA. THIS CONTRIBUTED TO THE LARGE PARTY YOUR ADJUSTMENT IN FISCAL YEAR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AS THAT IS CURRENTLY REFLECTED IN THE JAN TEN BUDGET FOR H. W. CA. THIS THERE'S BEEN CORRECTED AND THE CURRENT AND CURRENT AND YOUR FUND BALANCE FOR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN IS FOUR POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN H. W. CA. WHICH IS VERY CLOSE TO WHAT WE REPORTED LAST JUNE. WITH TOSCO WE IDENTIFIED LAST COUNT CONSEQUENTIAL ERRORS HOWEVER ADJUSTMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE AND THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE JUNE ENACTMENT GALLEY AND THE JANUARY TEN BUDGET ARE PRIMARILY DUE TO CHANGES IN EXPENDITURES FOR THE EXITE PROJECT. THE TO SEIZE CURRENT FEE STRUCTURE WAS LAST ADJUSTED IN. NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT AND IS INSUFFICIENT TO COVER CURRENT PROGRAM COSTS. IT'S DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WHICH LEADS TO ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS ON BOTH DTS SEE AN FEE PAYERS. SOME OF THE FEE FEES HAVE A COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT SOME DO NOT. TOTAL REVENUES ARE DEPENDENT ON COST RECOVERY PENALTIES AND INTEREST WHICH ARE VOLATILE AND THE FEES THEMSELVES FLUCTUATE ACCORDING TO ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND INDUSTRY PRACTICES. IT ALSO LOCKS OF FLEXIBILITY TO COVER SPECIFIC FUNDING NEEDS OF VERY OVER TIME AND LEVELS OF ACTIVITY UPON WHICH FEES ARE BASED. IT'S EXPENSIVE TO COLLECT THE FEES. CITY TEAR PHASE COSTA COLLECT THE FEES IS APPROXIMATELY SIX MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR H. WCAM TOSCA. DISPROPORTIONATE FEES ARE UNFAIR WITH SOME GENERATION GENERATORS OF WASTE PAIN NO FEES AND OTHER BUSINESSES SUBSIDIZING WASTE AND WASTE MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES OF OTHER BUSINESSES. WE WANT TO CHANGE ALL THAT. REVENUES HAVE NOT KEPT PACE WITH AN INCREASE INSTEAD OPERATION COSTS IN ADDITIONAL MANDATES. ALTHOUGH THE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT FEE STRUCTURE WAS ADEQUATE TO COVER THE PROGRAM COSTS THAT EXISTED AT THAT TIME. THE CURRENT STRUCTURE DOES NOT SUSTAINABLY SUPPORT DTS HE'S ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION RESPONSIBILITIES AND THE ADDITIONAL MANDATES THAT HAVE OCCURRED SINCE THAT TIME. EXAMPLES OF MANDATES THAT HAVE OCCURRED OVER THE YEARS WITHOUT ADDITIONAL AND FIND ADDITIONAL FUNDING INCLUDE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GREEN CHEMISTRY Là AB TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHICH RESULTED IN THE CREATION OF THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM. CURRENTLY FUNDED BY TOSCA. ADDITIONAL EXAMPLES INCLUDE IN TWO THOUSAND TEN THE METAL CONTAINING JEWELLERY LAW LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF LEAD IN JEWELRY PARTICULARLY CHILDREN'S JEWELRY. AND SENATE BILL THREE FORTY SIX PROTECTING WATER QUALITY BY REDISTRICTING COPPER AND OTHER HEAVY METALS AND MOTOR VEHICLE BRAKE PADS. AND IN TWENTY FIFTEEN SENATE BILL SIX SEVENTY THREE PERMIT CRITERIA FOR COMMUNITY PROTECTION. IN IN ADDITION TO AN INCREASE IN MANDATES BEYOND WHAT THE FEE STRUCTURE WAS INTENDED TO COVER. SEVERAL FACTORS INFLUENCE THE AMOUNT OF REVENUES GENERATED BY DTS SEE FEES SUCH AS ECONOMIC ACTIVITY JOB GROWTH CHANGES IN THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX AND INDUSTRY SPECIFIC CONDITIONS. IN THE PAST TWENTY YEARS THE STATE HAS EXPERIENCED INCREASES IN STATE OPERATIONS COSTS BUT ABOUT PEACE THE COST OF LIVING INCREASES THAT OUR PLIGHT TO SOME OF THE FEES. ACTUAL SPENDING HAS DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY WHEN ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION. AND THE NET RESULT IS DTS HE HAS FEWER RESOURCES TODAY THAN WHEN THE FEES FOR LAST ADJUSTED AND THOSE RESOURCES MUST BE STRETCHED TO ACCOMPLISH MORE. THESE FACTORS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO A DWINDLING FUND BALANCE H. WCAM TOSCA WHICH WE ARE NOW WHERE CANNOT CONTINUE TO COVER DTS HE PROGRAM COSTS. AGE W. CA RECEIVES FEES FROM VARIOUS HAZARDOUS WASTE GENERATORS FACILITIES AND TRANSPORTERS TO COVER ACTIVITIES MANDATED BY THE HAZARDOUS WASTE CONTROL LOS. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THE GENERATOR DISPOSAL FACILITY FEES WERE LAST SUGGESTED IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT THEIR SUBJECT TO A COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT AND COLLECTED BY THE CD TFA. ALSO LAST UPDATED IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT THE EPA ID VERIFICATION MANIFEST USER FEES ARE NOT ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION AND ARE COLLECTED BY DTS SEE. AGE W. C. ALSO RECEIVE THE PERMIT FOR SIT FOR A PERMITTING FEE FOR SERVICE WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED THROUGH SENATE BILL. EIGHT THIRTY NINE IT CREATED A FEE FOR SERVICE FOR PERMITTING TO REIMBURSE DTS SEE FOR ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED IN PROCESSING THE PERMIT APPLICATIONS. THIS CHANGE IS EXPECTED TO LESSEN PRESSURES ON THE ACCOUNT BUT WE WILL NOT COMPLETELY RESOLVE IT. AGE W. C. IS HAD A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT FOR FIVE OF THE PAST SIX YEARS. AND AVAILABLE FUND BALANCES HELPED US TO SUSTAIN OPERATIONS. ABSENT AN INCREASE IN REVENUES THAT ARE DEPOSITED INTO AGE TO BE CA DGSE WILL NEED TO RELY ON COST SAVING MEASURES INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN THE HOUSE REST WASTE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. TOSCA RECEIVES APPROXIMATELY 80% OF ITS REVENUE FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL FEE TO COVER THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH CLEANING UP SITES OCATED THROUGHOUT THE STATE. INCLUDING FORMAL INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES SCHOOL SITES MILITARY BASES SMALL BUSINESSES AND LANDFILLS ALL CONTAMINATED CONTAMINATED WITH TOXIC SUBSTANCES. SOME OF THESE ARE BROWN FILLED SITES THAT OFTEN SIT IDLE OR UNDER USED CONTRIBUTING TO BOTH URBAN BLIGHT BROUGHT BLIGHT AND SPRAWL. THE ENVIRONMENTAL FEE CONSISTS OF AN ANNUAL COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT AND THE REMAINING 20% OF TOSCA RESOURCES COMES FROM COST RECOVERY PENALTIES AND INTEREST. TOSSES TASK AS HAD A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT FOR FIVE OUT OF THE LAST SIX YEARS AND HAS RELIED ON TRANSFERS FROM NINETY TNC FUNDS TO MEET DTS SEES MPL. IN STATE OR FROM SIDE OBLIGATIONS. AS THE SECRETARY INDICATED THERE'S BEEN AN INCREASE IN DETAILS MPO OBLIGATIONS WHICH IS PUTTING PRESSURE ON TOSCA. TRANSFER FROM TOSCA INTO THE SITE REMEDIATION CAM IT BY STATUTE TO MPL IN STATE OR FAN SITES WERE NO RESPONSIBLE PARTY EXISTS TO PAY FOR INVESTIGATION AND REMEDIATION. THE MPO PRESSURE LIKELY TO INCREASE TO APPROXIMATELY SEVENTEEN MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE WILL LIKELY RESULT IN A NEGATIVE FUND BALANCE AND TOSCA IN THE NEAR FUTURE. HOWEVER WITHOUT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ADDITIONAL TRANSFERS TO THE S. R. A. BEYOND WHAT HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN TRANSFERRED WHICH IS ABOUT TEN MILLION ANNUALLY. OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES AT ORPHAN SITES AROUND THE STATE AS WELL AS FEDERALLY FUNDED REMEDIES WILL BE SHUT DOWN. NEEDLESS TO SAY SHUTTING DOWN CLEAN UP ACTIVITIES INCREASES HEALTH SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS AND INCREASES CLEAN UP COSTS WHEN ACTIVITIES RIVERS THAT RESUME. AND IN ABSENT AN INCREASE IN REVENUE TO COVER THESE COSTS DGSE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO FIND IT'S FEDERALLY MANDATED AND PALE OBLIGATIONS OR CONTINUE TO CLEAN UP AND MAINTAIN ORPHAN SITES AROUND THE STATE. IT WILL ALSO BE UNABLE TO FULLY IMPLEMENT MANDATES OF THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM. OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS DTS IS UNDERTAKEN A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES TO PREPARE FOR THE FEE RESET CONVERSATION. EXAMPLES OF THESE INCLUDE WE'VE CONDUCTED OVER EIGHTEEN LEAN SIX SIGMA PROJECTS WHICH ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF IMPLEMENTATION TO DECREASE TIME FRAMES FOR DELIVERY OF OUR SERVICES AND IMPROVE OVERALL SERVICE LEVEL. WE'VE ESTABLISHED A PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT AND PROGRAM REVIEW PROGRAM TO EVALUATE PROGRAM EFFECTIVENESS ASSISTED TSC WITH ITS STRATEGIC PLANNING AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES AND MONITOR PROGRESS ON OUR LEAN SIX SIGMA PROJECTS. WE CONDUCTED AN ORGANIZATIONAL HEALTH ASSESSMENT TO ESTABLISH A BENCHMARK FOR ORGANIZATIONAL HEALTH RECOMMENDATIONS RESULTED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SEVERAL INITIATIVES TO IMPROVE EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE AND SATISFACTION. WE'VE IMPLEMENTED A DTS C. LEADERSHIP ACADEMY AN INSPIRING LEADERS PROGRAM TO IMPROVE SUPERVISORIAL AND MANAGERIAL EFFECTIVENESS AND TO PER. PREPARE THE DEPARTMENT. TO STAFF TO TAKE ON LEADERSHIP POSITIONS IN THE FUTURE. OR CURRENTLY CONDUCTING A WORKLOAD ANALYSIS TO PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY ON HOW DO TIAS SEES USING ITS RESOURCES. AND DEVELOPING A DATA GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY WITH OUR DELIVERY OF SERVICES. WE'RE UPGRADING DTS THESE EXTERNAL WEBSITE WITH THE INTENT DEPENDING ON ADEQUATE FUNDING TO INCLUDE A DASHBOARD TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ON KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS. AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES PROGRESS. AND FINALLY WE RECENTLY CREATED A DTS THE STRATEGIC PLAN WHICH IS CURRENTLY BEING FINALIZED WITH THE SECRETARY'S INPUT AND WHEN HE SAID THAT HE'S INVOLVED IN THE DAY TO DAY ACTIVITIES WITH DTS SEE. I CAN TELL YOU HE IS INTIMATELY INVOLVED IN ESTABLISHING THE STRATEGIC PRIORITIES FOR THE DEPARTMENT AND THE FUNDING STRUCTURE TO SUPPORT THOSE ACTIVITIES. THE STRATEGIC PLAN WILL INCLUDE KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS WHICH WILL HIGHLIGHT PRIORITIES THAT WILL FORM THE BASIS AND TIED TO THE DEPARTMENT'S EXPENDITURE EXPENDITURE PLAN. AND RESOURCES. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE TO YOU AND I WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY MISTER MARTIN. SONOMA. SOMEWHERE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND I'M GONNA GIVE YOU CURRENT FISCAL SNAPSHOT OF THE HAZARDOUS WASTE CONTROL ACCOUNT AND TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACCOUNT. BRIEFLY ABOUT THAT COST DRIVERS FOR THOSE TO COUNT AND THEN -- I'M GONNA GO OVER SOME OF THE ACTIONS THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S TAKEN TO MITIGATE THE STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE IN BOTH OF THOSE ACCOUNTS BUT ONE IS START OFF BY SAYING THAT OVER HALF OF THE FUNDING. IN THAT DEPARTMENT TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROLLED BUDGET FOR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY COMES FROM THESE TWO FUNDS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY -- THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PROVIDED AN UPDATED FINE CONDITION STATEMENTS. FOR TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL COUNT HAZARDOUS WASTE CONTROL ACCOUNT LAST MONDAY. ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE THE NEW CONDITION STATEMENT RECONCILE THE TWO ACCOUNTS. THREE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND THEIR EFFECT UPDATED ADDRESS UPDATED ADJUSTMENTS IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THE FUN CONDITIONS STATE FRIEND FOR THE HAZARDOUS WASTE CONTROL ACCOUNT. SHOWS THE YEAR AND FUND BALANCE STEADILY DECLINING FROM PORT FOUR POINT SIX MILLION IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN TO NEGATIVE FIVE POINT SIX MILLION IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND NEGATIVE TWELVE POINT FOUR MILLION IN. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY SIMILARLY THE FUNK CONDITION STATEMENT FOR THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACCOUNT SHOWS THE YEAR AND FUND BALANCE STEADILY DECLINING FROM TWENTY NINE POINT EIGHT MILLION IN. MILLION IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT POINT THREE MILLION IN THE BUDGET YEAR. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY THIS CONTINUES A DOWNWARD TREND THAT WE HAVE BEEN OBSERVING OVER THE PRIOR FEW YEARS BUT WHAT WE HAVE NOW IS MORE ACCURATE -- SENSE OF THE THAT ACTUAL STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE BECAUSE WE HAD THESE UPDATED FROM CONDITION STATEMENTS. WE KNOW THAT IT'S SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL TO BE PROVIDED A WITH A CERTIFIED FOUND CONDITION STATEMENTS AT THIS LATE IN THE BUDGET PROCESS. TYPICALLY WITH THEIR PROVIDED AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PACKAGE ON JANUARY. TEN AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING THE HEALTH OF THE TWO ACCOUNTS FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS FEW YEARS -- AND REFER TO THAT THAT THE DEPARTMENT AND NAY AS WELL AS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAVE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY'VE BEEN WORKING VERY HARD TO DRESS THESE ISSUES. KNOWS JUST GOING TO BRIEFLY TALK ABOUT COST DRIVERS MUST TO THE POINTS THAT WE'RE GONNA MAKE HAVE ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED -- NOTE THAT SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT HAVE INCREASING COSTS -- ARE SALLY RATED TESTAMENTS AND BENEFIT ADJUSTMENTS FOR DTS SEE SOME PLACE AND THAT'S IN RESULT IN ANNUAL PROGRAM COST INCREASES -- THE STATE SHARE OF COSTS FOR REMEDIATION IN OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE AT FEDERAL SUPERFUND SITES IS INCREASING -- FOR EXAMPLE EXPENDITURES ARE ARE PROJECTED -- TO GROW FROM ABOUT NINE POINT SIX MILLION SORRY MEDIATION ACCOUNT TO THAT EIGHTEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION ANNA IS NOTED IN THE AGENDA WE'RE LOOKING AT CASA THINK BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN THE FUTURE. IN THIS AREA. KNOWN AS WE DISCUSSED ALREADY THERE BEEN NEW PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES SUCH AS THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM THAT HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN THEY'D RATHER FUNDING FROM THESE FUNDING SOURCES. SO LASTLY I WANTED TO GO OVER SOME OF THE FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS IN THIS AREA THE LEGISLATURE'S CONDUCTED A NUMBER OF BUDGET AND OVERSIGHT HEARINGS. TO LOOK AT THESE ISSUES -- THAT LEGISLATURE'S TABLETS THROUGH SB EIGHTY THREE AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW PANEL TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING THE DEPARTMENT'S OPERATIONS WITH THE GOAL OF RESOLVING. THIS OPERATIONAL DIFFICULTIES. ALSO AB TWO SEVENTY SIX IN -- EIGHTY TWO SEVENTY THREE HELP THE DEPARTMENT TO ADDRESS ISSUES REGARDING AND BUILD AND BUILD BUT I'M COLLECTED CLEANUP COSTS FROM RESPONSIBLE PARTIES -- SB EIGHT THIRTY NINE ELIMINATED THE OPTION TO PAY A FLAT FEE FOR HAZARDOUS WASTE PERMIT APPLICATION IN LIEU OF THE FEE FOR SERVICE. AND THE FLAT FEE OFTEN DID NOT COVERAGE THAT DEPARTMENTS COST TO PERFORM THE PERMIT RADIUS. AND FINALLY -- AB TWO FORTY FIVE INCREASED ADMINISTRATIVE AND CIVIL PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS OF HAZARDOUS WASTE CONTROL LIES SO LEGISLATURE'S BEEN AN ACTIVE PARTNER WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES -- AND I WANTED INCLUDE BY SAYING THAT WE NOW HAVE A MUCH BETTER PICTURE OF WHERE WE ARE IN TERMS AT THE STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE IN THESE ACCOUNTS. AND THAT GIVES US A MUCH BETTER BASIS TO TRY AND DEVELOP SOLUTIONS AND AT THE LA A WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH LEGISLATORS AND THEIR STAFF. TO PROVIDE YOU WITH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. THANK YOU VERY -- WILL PROCEED WITH QUESTIONS NOW -- DOCTOR ARAMBULA WANTED TO BEGIN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MAYBE I'LL JUST START BY SAYING I ACTUALLY SERVE ON E. S. T. M. AND NOT THE BUDGET SIDE. OF SUB THREE BUT I'M ACTUALLY GONNA FOCUS MOST OF MY COMMENTS ON THE BUDGET BECAUSE IT'S THE NEGATIVE BALANCE THAT TRULY IS DISTURBING ANY OF US. I SPENT MY LIFE WORKING IN THE ER WHERE HE TALKED ABOT CRISIS I KNOW A THING OR TWO ABOUT CRISIS HAVING A NEGATIVE BALANCE FOR THIS MANY YEARS. THAT DID NOT HAVE BUDGET TRANSPARENCY WITH THE LEGISLATURE IS A REAL PROBLEM FOR MANY OF US. A PROBLEM OF TRUST AND FEELING LIKE WE CAN LOOK TO THIS DEPARTMENT. TO HELP US TO COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS BUT I BELIEVE FOR AT AN INFLECTION POINT RIGHT NOW WITH THIS CHANGE AND THE MINISTRATIONS. AND REALLY WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE'RE DOING THIS TRUE UP. THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT WE MAINTAIN THAT TRANSPARENCY IN DISCUSSIONS THAT WE'VE HAD. IN THAT LIGHT I REALLY WANTED TO TALK ONCE WOULD HAVE THIS YEAR. WHAT'S GOING TO CHANGE IF WE DON'T HAVE GENERAL FUND CALM AND STEP UP AND MEET YOUR NEGATIVE BALANCE WHICH PROGRAMS ARE WE GOING TO HALT OR STOP THE WAR. NOT IMPLEMENT AND HOW -- BESIDES LOOKING TO GENERAL FUND WOULD YOU MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS EITHER FROM THE DEPARTMENTS OR TO TO MEET THAT MAKE IT A BOUNCE. START WITH THAT IF I CAN -- WELL THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION IT IS A DIRE SITUATION TO BE A THIS POINT IN TIME AND AND AND TO BE IN IN THE POSITION OF OF INCURRING A NEGATIVE SUNDANCE I WANT TO SAY THAT WILL. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO MAKE DIFFICULT DECISIONS -- WITH SCARCE RESOURCES OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO AND CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO PROBLEM SOLVE THIS CURRENT SITUATION. I'M ULTIMATELY ONE THING THAT WILL YOU ASKED THE QUESTION WHICH PROGRAMS ARE IMPACTED AND THE NEGATIVE FUND BALANCE PERTAINS TO THE HAZARDS WAS CONTROL ACCOUNT. AND THAT ACCOUNT COVERS ALL OF OUR ACTIVITIES THAT IMPLEMENT THE HAZARDOUS WASTE CONTROL LAWS WHICH INCLUDE. PERMITTING WHICH INCLUDE ENFORCEMENT OFFICE OF CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS -- AND SUPPORT SERVICES CREATION AND LEGAL. AND SOLE TIMIDLY IF WE'RE UNABLE TO GAP THAT NEGATIVE FROM BALLOTS WILL HAVE TO MAKE SOME CUTS TO THOSE PROGRAMS. AND SOMETIMES THOSE CUTS LEADS TOWARDS DELAYS WITHIN PERMITTING LEADS TOWARD SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT THE REST OF THE TNC. IS CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING. BUT EVEN IF WE ENTER INTO THE LARGER DISCUSSION REGARDING FEES THOSE FEES WOULDN'T BE COLLECTED THIS YEAR. THAT REVENUE WOULDN'T BE AVAILABLE TO THE NEXT YEAR AND SO THERE'S A WHOLE THIS YEAR THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE A BANDAID AND SOME REAL HONESTY AND TRANSPARENCY FOR THIS COMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATURE TO ENTERTAIN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MEETING THE NEEDS THAT. THE DEPARTMENT IS CURRENTLY BEING TASKED WITH. SO. IF IF I CAN HOW DO WE SOLVE THE PROBLEM THIS YEAR. HOW DO WE MEET THE NEEDS WITHOUT GOING TO GENERAL FUND ARE THERE ANY PLANS THAT YOU CURRENTLY HAVE? SO WE WE DO ONLY HAVE THE AUTHORITY WE HAVE TO COLLECT THE FEES THAT WE DO AND SO IT I THINK. CHIEF DIRECTOR CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR NEGRI ARTICULATED IT WHICH IS WE WILL HAVE TO CUT. ESPECIALLY WITHIN OUR HAZARDOUS WASTE PROGRAM AND THAT WOULD LEAD TO DELAYS AND PERMIT DECISIONS AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES IN CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS. MAYBE I'LL JUST END WITH THIS THE LEGISLATURE IS A WILLING PARTICIPANT IN WANTING TO REALLY ENGAGE THIS ADMINISTRATION. IN THIS DISCUSSION REGARDING FEES SEND -- IN DOING SUCH I HOPE WE CAN ALSO HAVE SOME INPUT INTO. PROGRAM AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE ACCOUNTABILITY WE NEED WITH AND DECISION MAKING SELL -- AS WE HAVE THAT LARGER DISCUSSION AND I THINK THE CHAIRMAN'S FOR BRING. THIS UP TO US. LET'S MAKE SURE WERE WORKING TOGETHER AND COLLABORATIVELY. TO ALLOW THIS DEPARTMENT TO HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED. TO ENACT THE GOAL OF HELPING TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. ALLOW ME OF A FOLLOW UP QUESTION -- TO DOCTOR ARAMBULA. POINTS IS THE DEPARTMENT INTENDING TO PRESENT -- THE LEGISLATURE WITH A PLAN. TO ADDRESS THE SHORTFALL ISSUE. AND SO WHEN WE ARE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON THAT PLAN CURRENTLY FOR THE SPRING HAVE A ASESORíA TALKING ABOUT MAY. A MIKE MY CONCERN IS THIS IS NECESSARILY GOING TO BE OF JUST BY DEFINITION IT'S GOING TO BE -- A COMPLICATED AND PERHAPS CONTROVERSIAL IN THAT DOES NOT LEAVE US. A HECK OF A LOT OF TIME. TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT PROCESS AROUND AROUND. TO THOSE ANYWAY TO MOVE THAT DATE UP I THINK THAT WOULD BE. EXTREMELY HELPFUL. MS GOMEZ REYES [inaudible] THANK YOU. I WANT. TO FOLLOW UP ON THE COMMENTS FROM DOCTOR ARAMBULA. IT'S CLEAR TO ME AND I'M A NEWCOMER THE DEPARTMENT. IS A MESS. THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDING THE PROTECTIONS TO CALIFORNIANS THEY SHOULD. HEARING TODAY ABOUT THE FACT THAT FOR THE LAST FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS. THERE HAS BEEN A DEFICIT. YET THERE WASN'T THE TRANSPARENCY IN THE THE REQUEST OF THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE US BE INVOLVED IN THAT. YEAH THERE'S A JOB THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. IN OUR JOB IS TO WORK WITH YOU. IT JUST AS DR RUMBLE SAID WERE WILLING PARTICIPANTS. BUT IF THERE IS NO TRANSPARENCY IF THERE IS NO [inaudible] DISCUSSION. THEN WE ARE LEFT IN THE DARK AND WE ARE LEFT TO ONLY QUESTION WHAT IS BEING DONE BECAUSE THE ANSWERS THAT WE GET SOMETIMES DON'T MAKE SENSE -- I I IT IN THIS IS NOT MEANT AS A AS A CRITICISM PERSONALLY. BUT YOU BOTH HAVE BEEN WITH THE DEPARTMENT. SINCE JANUARY TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SINCE DECEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN SO THE THE THESE ARE ISSUES. THAT HAVE BEEN THERE FOR SO LONG I CAN REMEMBER WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT A BILL THAT I WAS INTRODUCING REGARDING. THE THE PERMIT THE PERMITTING AN AYE AYE HE WAS GIVING EXTRA TIME AND WE WERE LOOKING AT THE FACT IN -- TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN VARMA SEPT SAFETY AND TOXIC MATERIALS COMMITTEE HIGHLIGHTED TWELVE FACILITIES THAT WERE OPERATING ON PERMITS THAT IT EXPIRED AS FAR BACK AS NINETEEN NINETY TWO NINETEEN NINETY TWO THERE ARE STILL SOME FACILITIES THAT ARE OPERATING A PERMITS EXTENDING AS FAR BACK AS NINETEEN NINETY SIX SO. THE NINETEEN NINETY TWO ONE HAS BEEN TAKEN CARE OF AND SO WE STILL HAVE SOME BETTER OVER TEN YEARS EXPIRED. AND THAT MEANS OF THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE THAT ARE LIVING AROUND OF THESE TOXIC -- FACILITIES ARE THE ONES THAT ARE TAKING THIS ALL IN AND WE DO KNOW THAT IT'S THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND THE COMMUNITIES OF COLORS THAT ARE MOST AFFECTED. FOR THE ONES THAT ARE MOST AFFECTED. MY QUESTION IS WHY HASN'T. MORE PROGRESS BEEN MADE. TO GIVE A CLEAR MESSAGE. TO THE LEGISLATURE. SO THAT WE COULD THEN. WORK WITH YOU. WHAT WAS MISSING? ALL ALL ALL ALL A DRESSER FROM THE BUDGET PERSPECTIVE AND THEN I'LL DEFER TO TO DOCTOR WILLIAMS TO ADDRESS -- THE PROGRAMMATIC CAM ASPECT OF YOUR QUESTION. AND IN AND I DON'T WANT TO BE DEFENSIVE IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM WE HAVE REALLY STRUGGLED WITH TRANSITIONING INTO FISK OUT. AND SOME OF THAT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY AND SOME OF THAT IS THE NATURAL PROCESS THAT OCCURS WHEN YOU'RE TRANSITIONING FROM A WELL KNOWN FISCAL SYSTEM THAT EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN USING FOR DECADES. INTO ONE THAT DOESN'T OPERATE AND FUNCTION THE SAME WAY THAT THE PRIOR ONE DID AND SO SOME OF ITS THAT CHANGE MANAGEMENT THAT WE STRUGGLED WITH. SOME THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE NEED TO STRENGTHEN OUR ACCOUNTING PROCESS SEES IN OUR ACCOUNTING PROGRAM AND HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO ESTABLISH LEADERSHIP TO DO THAT. WITH SPECIFIC EXPERTISE IN THE NOW -- THAT TAKES SOME AMOUNT OF TIME BUT WE SPENT -- AND I WANT. TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS BEEN OUR PARTNER IN THIS WE SPENT THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS WITH MPLOYEES WORKING EVERY WEEKEND TO THE HOLIDAYS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE COULD COME BEFORE YOU TODAY WITH ACCURATE FROM BALANCE NUMBERS BECAUSE WE KNEW. WE CAN'T START TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION INTO WE HAVE A RECONCILIATION OF ALL OF THOSE -- ACCOUNTING PERIODS AND NUMBERS AND SO -- YOU KNOW WITH THE CONVERSATION DOES START WITH -- ACCURATE NUMBERS SO THAT WE KNOW WHAT SITUATION WE HAVE WITH THE REVENUES WHICH WERE ESTABLISHED OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO NOW FOR A STRUCTURE THAT OR THAT EXISTED AT THAT TME. BUT WHICH HAS GROWN AND EVOLVED SINCE THEN SO ALL ALL ALL DEFERRED A DOCTOR WILLIAMS FOR ANY PROGRAMMATIC RESPONSE SO. THOSE THAT KNOW ME KNOW THAT MY FORMER CEO USED TO SAY. GOOD NEWS IS NO NEWS. NO NEWS IS BAD NEWS AND BAD NEWS IS GOOD NEWS AND I IS HERE TO THAT I'M HAPPY TO EXPLAIN THAT FURTHER IF ANYBODY CARES. BUT THE IDEA THAT BAD HERE TO IT NOW THOUGH YEAH WELL BAD NEWS IS GOOD NEWS MEANS THAT THAT MEANS COMMUNICATION IS HAPPENING THAT MEANS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE REAL PROBLEM IS ON THE TABLE. THAT MEANS YOU CAN ACTUALLY ENGAGE IN THE SOLUTIONS IN FINDING THE SOLUTIONS AND THAT HAS BEEN MY MODEL FOR MORE THAN A DECADE AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE MY MODEL. I ALSO THINK THAT THE SECRETARY ALLUDED TO THE FACT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION ACROSS THE BOARD ISM IS. COMMITTED TO TRANSPARENCY WANTS TO HAVE A REAL DISCUSSION ABOUT THE REAL ISSUES. I CAN'T SPEAK TO YOU KNOW ALL OF THE REASONS AND ALL THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WERE SHE TO SHARE INFORMATION IN THE PAST WHERE. I WANT TO GO BACK TO COME WITH A BELIEVE IT WAS SENATOR ALLEN WHO SAID THAT OR MAYBE IT WAS LIKE HAVE SKIS ABOUT BEING A DOCTOR AND YOU CAN BE A GREAT DOCTOR BUT YOU'RE NOT AN ACCOUNTANT. I GOT TO TELL YOU FROM DOCTOR AND I'M RUNNING A BUSINESS AND MY NUMBERS AREN'T MATCHING AND I'M NOT TAKING HOME SALARY I'M GOING TO FIGURE OUT WHO I HIGHER TO MAKE SURE THEY TAKE CARE OF THE NUMBERS. WE DON'T HAVE TO BE EXPERTS IN EVERYTHING AND THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS. AND THAT'S FOR ME THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT AND IS. IT'S A RHETORICAL QUESTION BUT I REALLY TO WANT TO HEAR THE ANSWER. IS THERE A SENSE OF URGENCY IN ADDRESSING THIS PROBLEM. IF YOU CENTERS RHETORICAL BUT THAT. IT YES. YES AGAIN EVERY DAY WERE ENGAGED WITH THE SECRETARY EVERY SINGLE DAY. ALL RIGHT WE WE WILL CLEARLY BE A BE ON THIS BECAUSE IT IS SO IMPORTANT. AND YOU KNOW MIGHT MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA AND SHE'S LIVING IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL OF THIS MORE SO THAN MANY OF US. BUT I DO THINK YOU I I I THANK YOU FOR THE LEADERSHIP I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO PROVIDE. A WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT WE REALLY ARE I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU. DOCTOR QUIRK FOLLOWED BY -- MS GARCIA AND MISTER ALLEN. WELL THANK YOU FOR THE BAD NEWS -- I I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR COMING FORWARD AND DISCLOSING ALL OF THIS INFORMATION. I ALSO WANT TO SAY WE WE CANNOT AFFORD TO MAKE CUTS. IN THE YOUR PERSONNEL THAT THINGS ARE -- ASUS LEVEL ALREADY -- AND I AGREE WITH THAT CHAIR -- BLOOM THAT WE NEED -- TO SUPPLEMENT YOUR BUDGET AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN TO PREVENT CUTS. AND HOPEFULLY TO GET TO THE RESOURCES YOU NEED SO YOU DON'T HAVE -- PERMITS THAT GO TWENTY YEARS IF THE RESOURCES ARE REALLY ONE OF THE REASONS. ARE THERE OTHER REASONS THAT PERMITS CAN TAKE TWENTY YEARS. SO I THINK THAT ACROSS THE BOARD IN THE DEPARTMENT WE HAVE CHALLENGES MAKING DECISIONS -- THERE ARE TOUGH DECISIONS TO BE MADE THEY NEED TO BE MADE THEY NEED TO BE DONE IN A TIMELY FASHION THEY NEED TO BE MADE BASED ON STE ON SOUND SCIENCE. AND IT TAKES INTESTINAL FORTITUDE TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS IN A TIMELY FASHION AND THAT'S PROBABLY OUR BIGGEST OPPORTUNITY IS JUST TO GET TO THE DECISION POINT. SOME OF THAT WILL HAPPEN THROUGH OUR NEW VIOLATIONS SCORING. PROCEDURES WHICH REALLY -- PROVIDE SOME CONSISTENCY AROUND WHAT WE'RE WHAT CONSTITUTES A VIOLATION THAT WOULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON HOW WE WHERE PERMIT DECISION I THINK THAT WILL ACTUALLY HELP US. GET TO THOSE DECISIONS IN A CONSISTENT WAY M.. OF ACTIVELY BUT WE ALSO HAVE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES JUST TO TO GET TO THAT DECISION POINT -- QUICKLY SO THAT'S PROBABLY THE NUMBER ONE THING I THINK WE CAN DO ACROSS THE BOARD -- ARE THESE DECISIONS BEING HELD UP BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT SUITS AND SO THEY WANT TO MAKE THINGS PERFECT. I THINK. I THINK THAT BIG LEGAL CALCULUS ALWAYS GOES INTO THINGS BUT WE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES GET SUED. IT'S THE NATURE OF THE BEAST. AND THAT'S LET US KNOW IF THERE IS A WAY WE CAN HELP YOU. AND I'D JUST LIKE TO ADD TO THAT WE ALSO HAD BUSINESS PROCESS. AND THE PERMIT DECISION. STRUCTURE THAT WERE ANTIQUATED AND THAT HAD NEEDED UPDATING AND AS THE SECRETARY NDICATED HE'S BIG ON LEAN. MANY OF OUR PROJECTS RELATE TO THE PERMITTING PROCESS ARE LEAN SIX SIGMA PROJECTS RELATE TO THE PERMITTING PROCESS AND WE'VE SEEN SOME SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS -- IN THE PILOTING OF NEW PROCESSES THAT WERE CURRENTLY UPDATING WHICH SHOULD RESULT IN -- SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN TIME FRAMES FOR DECISION MAKING PROCESS THE DECISION MAKING A PERMANENT ALONG WITH -- VIOLATIONS GREEN PROCEDURE THAT DOCTOR WILLIAMS IF YOU CAN MAKE A SUCCESS OF THESE -- WE WELCOME TO HAVE YOU BACK AND TELL US HOW YOU MANAGE TO GET SO I HOPE THAT. YOU CAN TELL US ABOUT SUCCESSES -- PERHAPS A YEAR FROM NOW THANK YOU [inaudible] GARCIA. THANK YOU I WOULD FOR A AS MY QUESTION I EIGHTY ONE A ECHO THE SENTIMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE MYSTERY IS ABOUT PERMITS THAT ARE OUT THERE. FOR TEMPERATURES HAVE BEEN OUT THERE FOR TEN YEARS -- AND SO EVERY FOR IN OUR FROM BACKSIDE WE SEE THE DANGERS THERE. ARE AND AND WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT EXCEPT BUT ALSO WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT EXIT IS ONE OF MANY ISSUES IN MY BACKYARD IT'S COMMUNITIES INTO LIKE A WASTELAND LONG BEFORE I WAS ELEVEN THAT'S IN FORTY TWO YEARS. LAW AND SO YOU KNOW I HAVE A LOT OF INTEREST IN MAKING SURE THAT EXCITED STONE PROPERLY AND WE LEARN FROM THAT ALL WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT MOVING FORWARD WILL TO DO ALL THE OTHER CLEAN UP ANY SAPONIN. IN MY BACKYARD WE WE HAD AN AUDIT IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN ABOUT DTC AND THEIR FAILURE TO COLLECT ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. IN FEES OUT THERE AND BECAUSE I'M WORRIED ABOUT HOW THE BATTERY FEE BILL IS BEING USED -- AND AND BECAUSE I WANT TO BE A PARTNER AT WHAT I HAVEN'T HEARD IS. WHAT ARE SOME IDEAS WE HAVE TO START COLLECTING THAT I WAS STARTING TO DO THAT I KNOW WE'VE GIVING IT ALREADY SO THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO START COLLECTING FEES? FROM FOLKS TO RECOVER COST HOW AGGRESSIVE ARE WE DOING THAT OF LEARNING AND WE HAVE AN EXTRA STARTED MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION YET. SO THAT THEIR TWO PIECE OF THAT I THINK -- ONE WOULD BE OUR COST RECOVERY EFFORTS AND THE OTHER WOULD BE OUR FEE FOR SERVICE WORK -- AND FOR SMALL COST RECOVERY WE LEARNED A LOT WE'VE CHANGED OUR PROCEDURES AND WE NOW WILL AGAIN IT'S ABOUT DECISION MAKING MAKING A DECISION MUCH MORE QUICKLY ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT IT'S EVEN WORTH PURSUING. IF THE IF THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY ISN'T THERE IN THIS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO RECOVER. ISN'T WORTH THE EFFORT WE ARE GOING TO PUT THE EFFORT INTO IT WE HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES. SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO PURSUE THAT BUT WE DID. OVERHAUL OUR COST RECOVERY PROCEDURES AND THOSE ARE BEEN IN PLACE FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS NOW AND THEY'RE WORKING EFFECTIVELY -- WITH RESPECT TO FEE FOR SERVICE THAT ALSO IS IN PLACE WE'RE STARTING TO SEE -- THE THE REVENUE FROM THAT NEW APPROACH -- COME IN AND I'M GOING TO LET. FRANCESCA NEVER TALK ABOUT. BRIGHT SO WE ARE -- WERE YOU AS A DOCTOR OWN SYNDICATE WE ARE STARTING TO SEE REVENUES COME IN FOR FEE FOR SERVICE I BELIEVE AND THIS I THINK WE'VE BUILD -- OVER TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN FEE FOR SERVICE -- FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR AND AND ARE HAVE COLLECTED OVER ONE SOMEWHERE AROUND ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. SO WE'RE STARTING TO SEE -- COME IN FROM THAT PROGRAM THAT ARE COVERING THE COST OF ON THE PERMIT WRITERS IN THAT PROGRAM AND THAT DOES LESSEN THE PRESSURE ON EACH W. CA -- WITH RESPECT TO I WANTED TO ADDRESS -- AND PROVIDE YOU WITH SOME INFORMATION ON THE PERMANENT SIDE OF BEEN -- EXPIRED MORE THAN TEN YEARS TO TO GIVE YOU A STATUS ON THAT. AND THE EXPIRATION -- FOR THREE PERMITS OR MORE IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX TWO THOUSAND FOUR IN TWO THOUSAND SIX A DECISION FOR ONE OF THOSE PERMITS HIS PLAN FOR FISCAL YEAR. NINETEEN TWENTY SEQUEL E. I. OURS ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED FOR THE TWO REMAINING PROJECTS AND THOSE DECISIONS ARE PLAN FOR FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY TWENTY ONE AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL YEAR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO ALL PERMITS ARE EXPECTED TO BE EXPIRED FROM NORMAL NO MORE. THAN THREE TO FIVE YEARS AND 90% OF PERMIT DECISIONS ARE EXPECTED WITHIN TWO YEARS ASSUMING SUFFICIENT RESOURCES ARE IN PLACE SO. THOSE ARE OUR GOALS TO ELIMINATE THE BACKLOG OF THOSE PERMITS HAVE BEEN EXPIRED FOR FOR YEARS AND YEARS. WHAT A SECOND I TAKE UNTIL? NO MULTI PLAYER SOMETIME YOU HAVE A PLAN WHICH I'M HAPPY TO HEAR. SOMETHING YOU FOR THE APPLE WISE THE PLANNED SO MANY YEARS STILL IN THE MAKING. I'M I'M HAPPY TO BRING UP THE EXPERTISE AND PERMITTED TO TALK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT WHY THOSE PARTICULAR PERMIT -- FACILITIES ARE SO COMPLICATED TO PERMIT -- I DON'T HAVE THE TECHNICAL EXPERTISE MYSELF AND I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH THE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT AS AS WERE. TRYING TO DO THE BACK BLOCK I UNDERSTAND NOT CUTTING C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; --&lt;/c&gt;</u> I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT GETTING STUCK ON PERFECT -- AND WE'RE DOING GOOD ENOUGH BECAUSE OF BOB OR WAITING WITH THAT MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE. GETTING SICK KINDA AND PUBLIC HEALTH THAT THAT IS TIED. UP WITH WITH THAT AND SO -- I UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR MAILING OUT THESE BILLS WHAT ARE WE DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY PAYING THESE BILLS WITH US OF THE PARTY WITH THE AUTO FOUND THAT WHILE WE MAILED OUT BILLS WE WHAT. DO ANYTHING TO MAKE SURE THOSE BILLS WERE BEING PAID. WE WE FOLLOW UP WITH -- NOTICES TO THEM THE FEE PAYERS -- AT REGULAR INTERVALS TO ENSURE THAT THERE WERE COST RECOVERY IN EARLY CHECKING TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT SYSTEM IS WORKING YES AND WE ALSO REFER OVER TO OUR LEGAL DIVISION WHEN WE HAVE ISSUES WITH WITH THREE PAYMENT NOR. WITH [inaudible] YEAH THINKING [inaudible] SENATOR ALLEN. YEAH I'D LIKE TO JUST TAKE DOWN A LITTLE BIT INTO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT THE EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH COLLECTING THE FEES. AND KIND OF UNDERSTANDING OF WHY THAT IS AND WHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP YOU GET MORE AGGRESSIVE ABOUT GOING AFTER THOSE FOLKS WHO REALLY OUGHT TO BE PAYING FOR YOUR PROGRAM -- IS YOUR QUESTION RELATED TO THE COST OF COLLECTING THE THE FEES THEMSELVES WE ARE. WAS MAJOR THE TFA I I THINK I MADE THE COMMENT THAT -- H. W. C. AND TOSCA FEES SOME OF THOSE ARE COLLECTED BY CITY TFA AND IT'S IT'S AT AN ANNUAL COST OF SIX MILLION DOLLARS -- AND THEN DTS C. COLLECTS A FEW OF THE FEES ITSELF SO WE ARE ACTUALLY EVALUATING -- THE AND AND DOING A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS ON ON WHETHER OR NOT IT MAKES MORE SENSE FOR D. TSC TO COLLECT THOSE HE'S DIRECTLY -- OR CONTINUE TO WERE CITIES. OKAY BUT WHAT WHY IS IT SO EXPENSIVE. YOU MENTIONED THAT. WELL I WOULD YOU KNOW I I I I DON'T -- UNDERSTAND ALL OF THE COST MECHANISMS THAT GO INTO CD TO HAVE FACE FEE STRUCTURE -- I DO KNOW THAT THOSE AMOUNTS SEEM HIGH TO ME IN TERMS OF THE ANNUAL COST -- BUT THAT IS WHAT THE BILL THE DEPARTMENT FOR COLLECTION OF THOSE FEES. WHO'S CALLING YOU AGAIN IT'S IN THE CALIFORNIA TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION IS TO BE THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION ARE THEY OKAY ARE THE IT IS AT ANY MORE THAN THE BILL OTHER PEOPLE OR IS IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH -- WITH -- IT DOES THAT IS THAT IS THAT A FORMULA OR YOUR WITH WHAT THEY'RE WHAT THEY'RE BILLING PRACTICES ARE WITH OTHER STATE DEPARTMENTS BUT AS I INDICATED WE ARE GOING TO BE TAKING A LOOK AT AND CURRENTLY A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS ON THAT COSTUME AGAINST COLLECTING THE CITY'S OURSELVES. YEAH I LOVE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THAT MYSELF AND IF IT'S A MATTER OF PROVIDING YOU WITH GREATER FORCE A MECHANISM -- POWERS OR OR IF IT'S A MATTER BETTER COORDINATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE OR SOME SORT OF THERE IS LITTLE CHATTER ON THE DíAS WHEN YOU MADE THAT COMMENT AND ONE OF THE COMMENTS SOMEONE MADE TO ME -- UNDER THEIR BREATH WAS THAT -- YOU KNOW THAT DID DATE SOME OF THESE FOLKS SOME OF THE POLLUTERS BASICALLY TIE YOUR KNOTS -- ITO -- CHALLENGING EVERY EVERY FEE -- DECISION [inaudible] AND YOU NOT LEAD TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THAT AND AND UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN GIVE YOU THE ENFORCEMENT TOOLS YOU NEED. TO BE ABLE TO GO AFTER THESE POLLUTERS. SO I I REALLY APPRECIATE THE DEPARTMENT REALLY APPRECIATES AT SUPPORT LET ME DIFFERENTIATE AND THEN MAYBE CLARIFY MY COMMENT -- I'M I WASN'T REFERRING -- TO THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES THAT ARE NECESSARY. TO COLLECT COST RECOVERY WHICH IS -- A REVENUE ELEMENT OF BOTH H. W. CA AND TOSCA AND WHICH IS A VOLATILE. REVENUE SOURCE WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO SUPPORTIVE OF THE COST OF THE PROGRAMS I WAS REFERRING TO THE COLLECTION OF THE ESTABLISHED FEES THE DISPOSAL FEE THE GENERATOR FEE. AND AND THE SECRETARY REFERENCE AT SOME OF THESE FEES ARE -- WE HAVE MULTIPLE FEES THAT HIT THE SAME FEE PAYER AND THEY'RE CONFUSING TO THE FEE PAYERS AND THOSE WITH THE FEES THAT I WAS REFERRING TO THAT CD TFA COLLECTS. COST RECOVERY IS WHAT THE DEPARTMENT BILLS DIRECTLY TO RESPONSIBLE PARTIES AND THAT'S AS YOU WERE FOR HER CAN RESULT IN DELAYS IN PAYMENTS AND LITIGATION WHEN THERE'S A RESISTANCE -- TO REIMBURSING THE DEPARTMENT FOR OUR ARE BILLED AMOUNTS AND THAT'S WHERE YOU KNOW IT'S A LITTLE MORE VOLATILE BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE WON'T RECEIVED -- THE PAYMENT -- IN THE BUDGET YEAR THAT WE AND BUILD IT OR WE MAY GET INTO LITIGATION TO COLLECT THOSE COSTS SO I I THINK. THERE'S THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT. PARTS OF FEES WERE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE EXPENSE TO COLLECT AND CD HERE PHASE WORK IS NOT IS RELATIVELY ROUTINE RIGHT. IT'S NOT EXCEPTIONAL THEY'RE NOT HAVING TO GO OUT AND DO A LOT OF ENFORCEMENT AND FOLLOW UP ON FEES THESE ARE THE NORMAL BREAD AND BUTTER FEES THE OKAY SO BUT BUT ARE THEY IS THERE SOMETHING ABOUT. YOUR INDUSTRY. THAT. LEADS TO A HIGHER FEE COLLECTION STRUCTURE OR IS THIS WHAT THEY'RE CHARGING ALL OF THE AGENCIES. THAT THEY DO THIS WORK WITH. SO WHEN WE DO THAT COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS THAT'S A KEY QUESTION FOR US OKAY OKAY WHAT WHY. SO I'M INTERESTED IN THAT AND I'M ALSO INTERESTED -- SO TO BE VERY JIM TO SEE THIS DIFFERENTIATION. MAYBE IT HAS TO DO WITH -- JUST THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS AND THERE'S ASPECTS OF THAT THAT WE DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE. IF THERE'S A FAX FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH GOING AFTER PHOBIA WITH GETTING. FEES FROM THE FROM THE TOXICS. AREA RATHER THAN FROM. OTHER AREAS OF STATE REGULATION -- ON THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE FAA THAT THE OTHER THING I LOVE. TO KIND OF LEARN MORE ABOUT IS AS YOU GET. DEEPER INTO THIS ANALYSIS ARE THERE TOOLS THAT YOU NEED. I THAT WILL MAKE IT EASIER OBVIOUSLY WANT TO PROVIDE EVERYONE TO PROCESS AND AND ALLOW FOLKS. TO YOU KNOW -- TO WE WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THE YOU KNOW THE YOU'RE SO APPROPRIATELY THAT THAT'S VITALLY IMPORTANT -- BUT IF. IF THEY'RE YOU KNOW THàNH YOU UP IN KNOTS ON NECESSARILY AND AND HAMPERING YOUR ABILITY TO DO YOUR WORK -- YOU KNOW -- WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT TOO AND AND TAKE. APPROPRIATE ACTION TO PROVIDE YOU WITH THE TOOLS YOU NEED. TO HOLD FOLKS ACCOUNTABLE. AND I WOULD LOVE TO ASSIST WITH THAT. THIS IS AN INTERESTING GOT TOPIC BECAUSE A YEAR ESSENTIALLY IN THE POSITION OF BEING OUT. ONE STATE AGENCY. ASKING ANOTHER WHY A CHARGING SO MUCH HA AND SIX MILLION DOLLARS -- ISN'T -- ISN'T CHICKEN FEED -- BUT DO YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONDUCT -- WHAT AMOUNTS TO A THIS IS A? SEEMS LIKE IT IT DEMANDS KIND OF AN AUDIT WHERE YOU'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING -- INTO THE PROCESSES OF THE OTHER AGENCY AND UNDERSTANDING HOW IT COMES TO PASS THAT THEY CHARGED THE THESE. SO WHAT WILL HAPPEN. I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT. YOU KNOW WHAT FUNCTIONALITY WE NEED WITHIN OUR OWN SYSTEM BEFORE ALREADY COLLECTING SOME FEES. THEN WHAT WOULD WE NEED TO WE NEED A LEGISLATIVE CHANGES IT IN STATUTE THAT WE USE -- FORMALLY BE -- YOU KNOW CITY TFA TO COLLECT THOSE FEES -- DO WE NEED A LEDGE PROPOSAL TO BE AND WHAT WOULD THE COST TO THE DEPARTMENT BE TO COLLECT THE CITY'S OURSELVES AND HOW WOULD THAT BE THAT D USE THAT THE BURDEN THAT STRUCTURALLY WHAT YOU WOULD NEED TO DO IN ORDER -- TO CHANGE -- YOUR MECHANISM IF THAT'S INDICATED THE QUESTION I HAVE GETS MORE AT WHETHER IT'S ACTUALLY INDICATED OR NOT AND HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT WITHOUT KIND OF PEELING BACK THE LAYERS OF THE ONION AND LOOKING. CLOSELY AT HOW THE FEES ARE BEING DETERMINED AND AND TO CHARGE CITY SKI TSA. SO I THINK THAT WILL BE PART OF THE ANALYSIS IS JUST ASKING CD TFA FOR COST BREAKDOWN OF THEIR SERVICES TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN YOU KNOW IT ANALYZE IT FOR APPROPRIATENESS AND FAIRNESS AND I I HOPE AND I DON'T MEAN. TO CAST ASPERSIONS ON THE OTHER AGENCY BUT I I HOPE THAT IT WILL BE A CRITICAL ANALYSIS. IN THIS POWER CAN. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE HEARD THIS DEGREE SAY A COUPLE TIMES -- IS THAT THE FEES THIS NOT. FAIR WHEN THEY'RE NOT BEING ASSESSED EQUALLY IN THE WAY YOU THINK THEY SHOULD BE I WANT TO FIRST CHECK ON MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS THAT. YOU KNOW AS WERE BEING ASKED TO PUT MORE GENERAL FUND MONEY INTO THIS TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY IS OBVIOUSLY CRUCIAL. YOU KNOW THE COLLECTION IF HE'S REALLY IMPORTANT BUT WE NEED TO KNOW THAT FROM START TO FINISH THIS PROCESS IS WORKING THE WAY IT SHOULD BE -- AND THAT YOU KNOW WE ARE IN PARTNERSHIP IN UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH FIXES NEED TO HAPPEN AND HOW WE CAN BOTH PROTECTOR COMMUNITIES FROM THE IMPORTANT WORK. LUCIEN IT IS OUT THERE AND YOU'RE ABLE TO DO THE IMPORTANT WORK YOU'RE TASKED TO DO BUT THAT IT'S BEEN DONE IN A WAY THAT'S FAIR AND EQUITABLE SO CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT THE AS THE FEES THAT ARE ASSESSED IN THE EQUITY. THERE. SURE OF COURSE WELL I THINK THAT I THINK THE SECRETARY OPENED UP THAT -- THAT. THAT LINE WITH HIS COMMENT THAT SOME FEE PAYERS ARE PAYING -- FOR YOU KNOW OTHER BUSINESSES WASTES AND THE LIKE AND SO AGAIN THIS FEE STRUCTURE WAS CREATED BACK IN OUT OF A TASK FORCE -- IN -- NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN IT WAS CREATED -- YOU KNOW DID THE BEST JOB COULD AT THAT TIME TO CREATE THIS FEE STRUCTURE FOR THE ORGANIZATION THAT EXISTED AT THAT TIME. AND THE FEES HAVE AND SO YOU HAVE SOME BUSINESSES THAT ACTUALLY CREATE HAZARDOUS WASTE IT PAY NO FEE AND THEN YOU HAVE SOME BUSINESSES THAT PAY. FEES IN A VARIETY OF AREAS SUCH AS THE SECRETARY REFERENCED YOU KNOW A A FACILITY MIGHT PAYYOU KNOW OF FACILITY FEE IN A PERMIT FEE AND AND MULTIPLE FEES TO COVER. THE HAZARD THEIR ACTIVITIES UNDER THE HOUSES WAS CONTROL US NOW THOSE ACTIVITIES ARE ALL VERY SEPARATE AND DISTINCT. BUT IT MAKES THE WHOLE STRUCTURE OF BIT CONFUSING AND SO -- WE WOULD LIKE TO PARTNER WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE FEE STRUCTURE AS IT IS TODAY TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT IT ALIGNS WITH YOU KNOW THE LEVEL OF PROTECTION -- THAT AND WE M. AS A STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THIS ADMINISTRATION WANT TO PROVIDE IN TERMS OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND PROTECTION OF OUR COMMUNITIES FROM HAZARDOUS WASTE. AND DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT AND MAKE DECISIONS ON WHETHER OR NOT THAT THE STRUCTURE SUPPORTS THAT THAT PROGRAM INTEGRITY AND LEVEL OF SERVICE. THANK YOU I MEAN I JUST WANNA. TAKE ONE MOMENT AND SAY I APPRECIATE THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE OBVIOUSLY ARE ALWAYS LOOKING AT THE EQUITY WITH WHICH WE ASSESS ALL FEES IN CALIFORNIA -- BUT AGAIN AS WE LOOK AT PUTTING MORE MONEY AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE INSURE THAT THAT WAS CONSTANT COMMUNICATION THAT THIS ISN'T BROUGHT UP WHEN WE'RE IN THE DIRE STRAITS WE'RE IN TODAY. BUT THAT WE UNDERSTAND ON AN ONGOING BASIS WHAT'S HAPPENING WHY IT'S HAPPENING AND HOW OUR MONEY IS BEING SPENT THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER GOMEZ REYES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. IN RESPONSE TO ONE OF THE QUESTIONS FROM ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA. YOU MENTIONED THAT. IF YOU HAVE THE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES YOU'LL BE ABLE TO DO THE WORK. WHAT ARE THE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES AND THE REASON I ASK IS THAT? WE'VE JUST HAD A LONG CONVERSATION REGARDING THE POTENTIAL SHUFFLING THE FUNDS TO SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL CHALLENGES. I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT. IN THREE YEARS WILL BE BACK HERE AND WE'LL BE TOLD THE REASON WE DIDN'T DO IT IS BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES. IS THERE A PLAN THAT IS BEING PUT TOGETHER. WHEN WILL THAT PLAN I I KNOW WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE AUDIT WE TALKED ABOUT ANALYSIS? IS THERE A PLAN BEING PUT TOGETHER THAT IS GOING. TO TAKE US FROM POINT A TO POINT B. THAT YOU ARE. SO THE NEWS DEPARTMENT CAN WORK IN A MORE PROGRAMMATIC -- WAY -- THAT IS THAT IS. THE TAKES CARE BUSINESS AND IN THE MORE FISCAL WAY -- THAT ALLOWS YOU -- TO COLLECT THE FEES THAT YOU NEED TO COLLECT BUT TO BE ABLE TO BE A SUCCESSFUL -- DEPARTMENT BECAUSE AS I THINK ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID IT'S THE CALIFORNIANS WERE GOING TO SUFFER FROM. THE WORK THAT IS BEING THAT IS NOT BEING DONE -- AND I THE THE I'M NOT SAYING IT'S FINGER POINTING -- AND EAT THE THAT IT WAS A GOING BACK TO THE TRANSPARENCY ISSUE. AND I I ECHO WHAT MY COLLEAGUE HAS JUST TALKED ABOUT. WE DON'T HAVE THE TRANSPARENCY WE DON'T HAVE THE TRUST AND YET THERE'S A COMMENT ABOUT HAVING MORE FUNDS PROVIDED TO YOU SO YOU CAN DO YOUR JOB. THEN THE QUESTION IS. WHY WEREN'T WE TOLD ABOUT THIS BEFORE WHAT'S THE PLAN ON HOW THIS IS GOING TO BE SPENT? UP HOW WOULD WE TAKE CARE OF NOW SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE PROBLEMS IN THE FUTURE. AND I'D LIKE TO END WITH JUST. WE'VE TALKED A WHOLE LOT ABOUT -- THE H. W. CA. A SHORT FORM -- WE UNDERSTAND THAT'S IT THAT FUND IS MORE URGENT. BUT THIRTY SCA IS ALSO ALSO HAS A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT -- THE NEW FUND CONDITION STATEMENTS MIGHT GO INTO A NEGATIVE IN 202-020-2020. ONE ABSENT ACTION THIS YEAR AND CALLS AGAIN IS THE DEPARTMENT DEVELOPING A PLAN TO ALSO ADDRESS THE LOOMING NEGATIVE. DEFICIT OF THE TS SCA ACCOUNT. I KNOW IT'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS. YEAH A LOT OF CONCERN THE I I WANNA I WANNA REFER BACK TO THE SECRETARY'S COMMENTS WHERE HE IS -- INDICATED HE'S AND PARTNERING WITH THE DEPARTMENT -- TO IDENTIFY YOU KNOW GET A BASELINE FOR WHAT LEVEL OF SERVICE WE CAN PROVIDE WITH CURRENT RESOURCES WE HAVE AND HE INDICATED THAT WE WERE A FEW MONTHS OUT WITH THAT AND THAT. TIES TO AND OUR WORKLOAD ANALYSIS THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY HAVE UNDER WAY IN THE DEPARTMENT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT -- THE EM. IF AN I WANT TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION FOR THE LEGISLATURE SUPPORT OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS WITH PROVIDING RESOURCES TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE. PROGRAM ISSUES WE BROUGHT TO YOUR ATTENTION THE LEGISLATURE'S BEEN A VITAL PARTNER WITH DTC OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS ON PERMITTING AND IN PARTICULAR AND IF YOU RECALL -- DE AND LEGISLATURE -- APPROVED FOR SOME PERMANENT POSITIONS WITH LIMITED TERM FINDING SOME OF WHICH WERE TO SUPPORT THE PERMITTING PROCESS AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS REFERRING TO WE'VE HAD -- A GREAT DEAL OF SUPPORT FROM THE LEGISLATURE HONOR PERMITTING PROGRAM WE'VE HAD SOME PERMANENT POSITIONS THAT ARE TIED TO THE FEE FOR SERVICE. AND THE RESOURCES THAT I WAS REFERRING TO THAT WERE NECESSARY IN ORDER FOR US TO MEET 90% OF OUR PERMITS WITHIN TWO YEARS ARE RELATED TO THE SUPPORT PROGRAMS THAT WERE ESTABLISHED AS PERMANENT POSITIONS. BUT LIMITED TERM FUNDING BECAUSE OF THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE H. W. CA WAS IN A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT IN THAT WE WERE WAITING -- FOR THE CLARITY ON THE FUND BALANCES IN ORDER TO TAKE TO PARTNER WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO IDENTIFY SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS THAT PARTICULAR SITUATION SO WE'VE MADE -- WE'VE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS ON THE PERMITTING BUSINESS PROCESSES TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCIES ULTIMATELY -- WE STILL ARE SHY RESOURCES IN SOME OF OUR SUPPORT PROGRAMS AND WHAT I'M REFERRING TO IS ENFORCEMENT IN LEGAL -- IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THAT AND AND PROCESS FOR THE PERMIT ISSUANCE IS FULLY IS FULLY SUPPORTED -- TO YOUR QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE DEVELOPING A A PLAN WE ARE ABSOLUTELY WORKING WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN THE ADMINISTRATION IT'S A BRAND NEW ADMINISTRATION SO. THE TSC IS -- WORKING COOPERATIVELY IN CLOSELY AND INTENSELY AND WITH URGENCY ON SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. AND THEN IN TERMS OF THAT LARGER PLAN ABOUT WHAT PROGRAMS SUPPORT REALLY LOOKS LIKE WHAT DOES A HEALTHY DEPARTMENT LOOK LIKE AS AS THE SECRETARY LOOTED TO THERE ARE NUMBER OF PIECES TO THAT SO. THERE WAS REFERENCE TO OUR STRATEGIC PLAN IN THAT STRATEGIC PLAN WE TALK ABOUT WHAT WE THINK. IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE. WHEN THE DEPARTMENT IS FUNCTIONING AS A HEALTHY DEPARTMENT WHAT KINDS OF SERVICES DO WE PROVIDE WHAT CAN? CALIFORNIANS EXPECT US TO DELIVER SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT PICTURE. YOU HAVE TO THE PICTURE OF OUR STATUTORY MANDATES AND WHAT WE'RE REQUIRED TO DO UNDER THE LAW. WE HAVE TO HAVE A GOOD PICTURE OF OUR FIRST FISCAL POSITION. AND WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND OUR THIS THIS WORKLOAD ANALYSIS WHAT IT WHAT WE THINK -- WHAT DO WE KNOW BASED ON DATA IT TAKES TO DO? THE JOB. AND WHEN YOU BRING THE THEN YOU GET THE COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE OF WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE TO SUPPORT AN EFFECTIVE HEALTHY DTS SEE? AND UNTIL WE BRING ALL THOSE ELEMENTS TOGETHER WE WE WON'T HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE. DESCRIPTION OF WHAT OF A NEW REVISED FEE STRUCTURE WOULD LOOK LIKE AND WHAT ADEQUATE FUNDING WOULD WOULD BE TO MEET OUR MANDATE. AND FINALLY IF I MAY. AS ACTING DIRECTOR. I REITERATE WHAT YOU'VE HEARD FROM MY COLLEAGUES WE ARE WILLING PARTICIPANTS WE NEED THE TRANSPARENCY WE NEED TO REBUILD THAT TRUST. YOU ARE IN A NEW POSITION AND YOU GET TO LEAD THE DEPARTMENT EVEN IF IT'S HONORED ON AN INTERIM BASIS. AND WE ARE HERE TO BE YOU'RE WILLING PARTNERS THANK YOU IF I IF I CAN JUST SAY I'VE SENT TO THAT FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS IN THE DEPARTMENT THAT'S BEEN MADE. HE DID LEE CLEAR FROM THE LEGISLATURE THAT YOU WANT THE DEPARTMENT TO WORK YOU WANTED TO WORK EFFECTIVELY AND YOU'RE WAITING FOR US. TO BRING TO YOU EITHER OF COMPREHENSIVE PROBLEM STATEMENT OR PROPOSED SOLUTIONS AND SO WE NEED TO GET TO THAT CONVERSATION. WE DO HAVE A SENSE OF URGENCY ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR QUESTIONS AND THANK YOU FOR THE DETAILED RESPONSES SO -- FROM THE DEPARTMENT BEFORE WE MOVED TO PUBLIC COMMENT -- I WANT TO OBSERVE WHAT MAY HAVE BEEN OBVIOUS TO SOME OR ALL OF YOU AND THAT'S THE FACT THAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. IS NOT HERE TODAY -- THAT IN FACT BECAUSE BY DESIGN WE WANTED TO FOCUS ON THE DEPARTMENT -- AND AND HAVE YOU -- HERE TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS DIRECTLY -- AND YET DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS A BIG PIECE OF THE PUZZLE A BIG PIECE OF THE SAUSAGE MAKING THAT HAPPENS HERE AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS AND YOU KNOW WITHOUT GOING INTO A LOT OF DETAIL -- WHAT WE FROM YEAR TO YEAR -- WHAT DEPARTMENTS -- CAN AND CAN'T DO -- ARE AS MUCH A REFLECTION OF WHAT COMES OUT OF THE DEPARTMENT AS IT IS A REFLECTION OF THE ENTIRE BUDGET AND MOVING PIECES AROUND -- AND YOU KNOW FRANKLY THAT CAN CAN BE VERY FRUSTRATING WHEN YOU ARE FOCUSED ON FIXING A PROBLEM. BUT PROVERBIAL -- SO RECOGNIZE THAT AND I DON'T WANT -- TO SUGGESTS THAT -- NOBODY UNDERSTANDS -- THAT PART OF THE PROCESS SO THANK YOU AGAIN -- FOR FOR BEING HERE I WOULD -- ALSO POINT OUT THAT -- WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD -- OBVIOUSLY WE ARE INFORMED BY -- WHAT EXISTS TODAY AMPLE AT BY WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE PAST -- BUT WE NEED TO BE LOOKING FORWARD AND TO DOING THE HARD WORK OF FOR A REDRESSING WHAT IS A VERY -- SERIOUS STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS -- WITH WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT AND YOU HAVE FOR YOU ON ACHIEVING A FAVOR ALL OF THESE ISSUES SO -- THANK YOU AGAIN AND WILL NOW PROCEED TO HEAR -- FROM -- MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC -- NOBODY'S UP YES PEOPLE ARE. GAP IF YOU WOULD STEP FORWARD TO THE MICROPHONE -- WILL BE HAPPY TO HEAR FROM YOU GOING. DON'T BE SHY. A GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS INGRID RESTAURANT I'M WITH THE CENTER ON RACE POVERTY IN THE ENVIRONMENT. AND I BEEN WORKING ON THE TNC ISSUES FOR MANY YEARS SPECIFICALLY WITH AN EYE TOWARD RESIDENTS. WHO LIVE NEAR HAZARDOUS WASTE FACILITIES AND RESIDENTS WHO LIVE NEAR CLEAN UP SITES -- I HAD HEARD A LOT ABOUT SOME OF THESE FISCAL ISSUES BEFORE. BUT I THINK IT CAME. IT CAME CLOSER TO HOME WHEN I HEARD ABOUT PROGRAM CUTS. AND I WANT TO REITERATE FOR THIS BOARD THAT ANY CUTS TO PROGRAMS THAT PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH. WILL NOT RESULT IN OLD MCAT COST SAVINGS IT'LL MERELY. SHIFTED THOSE COST BURDENS TO RESIDENTS WHO ARE DIRECTLY IMPACTED IN TERMS OF HIGHER HEALTHCARE COSTS -- HIGHER SCHOOL ABSENTEEISM LOWER PRODUCTIVITY. AND AS A STATE WE SUBSCRIBE TO THE POLLUTER PAYS PRINCIPLES. AND WE MUST LOOK AT FEE REFORM IN A WAY THAT ULTIMATELY REDUCES THE GENERATION OF HAZARDOUS WASTE AND ENSURES THAT THOSE THAT ARE PROFITING FROM THE HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT ARE THE ONES THAT -- ALTERNATELY COVERING FULLY. I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE LEGISLATURE LEGISLATURE. CONTINUING TO THROW MONEY AT THIS AGENCY YEAR AFTER YEAR TO TO CLOSE THOSE LOOP. SHORTFALLS. IF. THE LEGISLATURE DOES BAILOUT DTS SEE AGAIN THIS YEAR IT MUST TO DO SO WITH STRINGS ATTACHED. IT MUST CREATE AN OVER A STRONG IN PERMANENT OVERSIGHT BODY AND STRONG CONCRETE BENCHMARKS THAT WE CAN THAT ARE MEASURABLE AND THAT WE CAN LOOK AT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DETAILS HE'S MAKING MOVEMENTS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTIONS. AND IF THESE BENCHMARKS CONTINUE NOT TO BE MET WE HAVE TO HAVE REAL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THIS AGENCY AND THE NEED PERHAPS TO COMPLETELY. REVISIT HOW WE MANAGE HAZARDOUS WASTE IN CALIFORNIA AND AS A WITH AN EYE TOWARD POLLUTION PREVENTION AND HAZARDOUS WASTE REDUCTION. THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME'S KRISTINA WHITNEY AND I'M HERE REPRESENTING THE SOLAR PEAVEY INDUSTRY. AND THE REASON I'M HERE TODAY IS BECAUSE IN SENATE BILL FORTY NINE IN SECTION SEVENTEEN D. TSC HAS CLASSIFIED SOLAR PANELS AS HAZARDOUS WASTE AND THAT IS NOT. THE CASE THEY ARE NOT HAZARDOUS WASTE THERE IS ONE COMPANY IN THE INDUSTRY OUT OF THOUSANDS OF-MANUFACTURERS. THAT DOES HAVE HAZARDOUS WASTE IN THEIR SOLAR PANELS AND IN HOUSE THEY DEAL WITH THEM AND RECYCLE THEM IN A PROPER MANNER KEEPING THEM OUT OF LANDFILLS. OUR CONCERN IS WITH THE WAY THE SENATE BILLS RIGHT NOW THAT THE INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA HAS BECOME FRIGHTENED. AND NOW THEY STORE THE SOLAR PANELS. AND THEY HAVE BEEN FILLING UP IN PLACES LIKE UNDER BRIDGES WHERE HOMELESS PEOPLE LIVE THEY HAVE BEEN FOUND IN. A SORT STORAGE FACILITIES ALLEN THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE FEEL AS GOING TO TARNISH THE REPRESENTS THE SEPARATIST BUT THE NAME OF THE SOLAR INDUSTRY. WHICH WERE GREEN INDUSTRY AND WE WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT KEEPING THE SOLAR PANELS OUT OF LANDFILLS. BECAUSE IT'S CONSIDERED HAZARDOUS WASTE IN CALIFORNIA AND THE WAY THAT THINGS ARE WRITTEN THAT THEY CAN ONLY BE STORED FOR THIRTY DAYS. IT WITH THE CAN'T BE RECYCLED IN CALIFORNIA. THE INDUSTRY DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WERE STOCKED WITH THE SOLAR PANELS SO WHAT I'M GONNA ASK YOU TO WRAP UP QUICKLY IF YOU DON'T MIND THIS IS NOT. REALLY RELEVANT TO THE TOPIC OF THAT'S UNDER DISCUSSION HERE TODAY BUT I WOULD ASK THE DEPARTMENT IF THEY CAN GET TO YOUR INFORMATION AND SO THAT THEY CAN ASSIGN SOMEBODY TO MASON AT YOU HAVE AND LOOK INTO THIS ISSUE. WOULD BE VERY HAPPY TO SHARE AND WOULD ALSO ASK THEM TO LOOK AT WASHINGTON STATE AND HOW THEY HAVE CREATED A LOSS IN THAT THERE HAS TO BE RECYCLING. BEFORE. SOLAR SOLD INTO THEIR STATE AND IF WE GET COPIES OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING I THINK IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR CALIFORNIA AND OF WE DON'T ACT NOW AND WE DON'T CHANGE THE WAY THINGS ARE THANK YOU ARE GOING TO PAY THE PRICE THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND TOOK.

GOOD MORNING MY NAME SHEENA ROBINSON I'M WITH THE ASIAN PACIFIC ENVIRONMENTAL NETWORK -- AND I JUST LIKE TO ECHO SOME OF THE POINTS OF MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE CALIFORNIA VINYL JUSTIN'S ALLIANCE HAVE MADE -- A PEN WORKS IN RICHMOND CALIFORNIA WHICH IS HOME TO HUNDREDS OF HAZARDOUS WASTE SITES. ALONG WITH TO SUPERFUND SITES -- AND MANY OF THESE SITES HAVE BEEN THERE FOR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS RICHMOND IS ALSO 80% PEOPLE OF COLOR AND MOSTLY WORKING CLASS AND IT'S THIS KIND OF COMMUNITY THAT'S BEEN HEAVILY BURDENED. BY JUST THE SHEER AMOUNT OF TOXIC WASTE SITES -- AND SOME OF THEM ARE OPEN AIR -- RESIDENTS EVEN REFERRED TO A LARGE WHEN HIS TRASH MOUNTAIN THAT AFFECTS THE RESPIRATORY -- HEALTH IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THERE ARE ENDS -- WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT A PEN WAS FOUNDED DECADES AGO THE CONTINUE TO THIS DAY -- ALONG WITH -- DOCTORS MEDICAL CENTER WHICH WAS THE THE YOU PUBLIC HOSPITAL SERVING THE COMMUNITY CLOSED IN -- TWENTY FIFTEEN AND SO IF WE DON'T HAVE STRONG PUBLIC OVERSIGHT OF OF THE THE PROCESSES THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO COMMITTEE KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE -- THEY'RE GOING TO KEEP CONTINUING TO SUFFER AT THE HEALTH IMPACTS IN THE STATE IS GOING TO HAVE TO PAY FOR THESE HEALTH BACK IMPACTS. IN OTHER WAYS AND SO I'M HERE TO JUST ADVOCATE FOR STRONG SUPPORT OF A ROBUST -- OF A DEPARTMENT THAT IS OVER TO TAKE CARE OF THESE PROBLEMS -- WITH STRONG COMMUNICATION MINUTE OVERSIGHT AS WELL FUNDED -- AND THAT HELPS -- INSURE THAT POLLUTERS PAY -- TO REMEDY THESE INSTEAD OF THE PUBLIC THINKING. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS LEE SAID VAN FLEET I'M FROM BREAST CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS. I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF THE CENTER FOR RACE POVERTY IN ENVIRONMENTS. AND ALSO SAY THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF TOXIC CHEMICALS THAT ARE GENERATED. THAT THEN BECOME THE HAZARDOUS WASTE AND SO IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NOT CUTS. TO THE SIGNATURE PROGRAM OF THE DEPARTMENT OF TALK TROLL THE GREEN CHEMISTRY ACT ON THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM BECAUSE THAT IS AT LEAST A START AT TRYING TO REDUCE THE TOXIC CHEMICALS THAT GET INTO PRODUCTS THAT END UP IN. THE BATTERIES AND THE BRAKE PADS AND OTHER ITEMS [inaudible] BUT IT'S CLEAR THAT THE BUDGET DEFICIT IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE URGENTLY ADDRESSED. AND THE FACT THAT THIS IS ALREADY GOING ON FOR FIVE YEARS DURING THAT TIME WHERE THERE WAS A TRANSITION TO AN ACCOUNTING SYSTEM IS. A CLEAR EXAMPLE OF THE NEED FOR MORE CAREFUL MORE CONTINUOUS A MORE REGULAR OVERSIGHT OF THE DTS CITY. SO WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE REFORMS THAT THE NEWS SECRETARY WANTS TO BRING ABOUT -- THE BREAST CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS ADVOCATES THAT THERE IS A BODY THAT REGULARLY AND MORE IN DEPTH DIGS INTO THE MANAGEMENT OF THE DTS SEE AN IT'S FISCAL SITUATION. WE SUPPORT THE POLLUTER PAYS PRINCIPLE. AND THINK THAT. IF COST RECOVERY IS ONLY STARTING TO HAPPEN NOW AND IS NOT RETROACTIVE TO A LOT OF COMPANIES THAT HAVE INCURRED THESE STEPS WE WILL NOT BE SUFFICIENTLY ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BILL ALLEY -- FOR ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP -- WERE HEARTENED BY THE STANCE TAKEN BY THE NEW SECRETARY. AND ALSO BY THE CURRENT LEADERSHIP OF THE DEPARTMENT THAT I THINK WE'LL. SEE WHERE WE STAND THREE YEARS FROM NOW OFFERS STILL WORRIED ABOUT THE SAME THINGS SO IT'S HEARTENING BUT WE'LL SEE. ALSO APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS BY DOCTOR QUIRK ABOUT NOT LETTING THIS PART BE CUT. THINGS WILL ONLY GET WORSE -- I THINK CENTERS STONE KIND OF FORCE -- TODAY WHICH WAS THE FEE STRUCTURE AND WHEN YOU HEAR ABOUT NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT STRUCTURE THAT STILL EXISTS TODAY AND CLEARLY BROKEN -- HE WAS TALKING ABOUT EQUITY AND WHO IS PAYING WE ARE TOO AND WE THINK THE POLLUTERS SHOULD PAY AND CLEARLY THIS IS GOING TO BE. A PRIMARY -- THING GOING FORWARD ONE LAST THING IS ON THE FENCE LINE COMMUNITIES AND WHETHER THERE REALLY BEING AFFECTED I HARKEN BACK TO THE ALANKO OIL WELL IN LOS ANGELES WHERE PEOPLE COMPLAINED FOR YEARS ABOUT BEING SECOND NO ONE BELIEVED HIM. UNTIL USEPA ACCOMPANYING DARKER OFFICIALS THERE COST SIX THEMSELVES ON SITE AND FINALLY SOMETHING WAS DONE. SO PEOPLE ARE DARK HYPOCHONDRIAC'S THEY ARE REALLY GETTING HEADACHES AND NOSE BLEEDS AND BIRTH DEFECTS ETCETERA ALSO WE HAVE EXCITE IS THE MAYBE ONE OF THE ULTIMATE EXAMPLES OF WHAT HAPPENS IF. YOU LET EXTERNALITIES CISCO AND GO SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THAT LEADS ME TO THE POOL -- POLLUTION PREVENTION PROGRAM WE THINK SHOULD BE RESTORED AT THE AGENCY TO AVOID THINGS LIKE THIS IN THE CRADLE -- TO CRADLE OF THING IS VERY IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF GOING FOR AND REFORMING THE DEPARTMENT THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS ANDREA EVAN TURNER I'M WITH CLEAN WATER ACTION. AND I CAME HERE TODAY TO STAND UP FOR OUR ORGANIZATION CLEAN WATER ACTION TO STAND IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE COMMUNITIES AT THE FENCE LINE WHO. ARE PAYING THE THE PRICE -- FOR FOR THE NOT ONLY THE HAZARDOUS WASTE BUT SOME OF THE MISMANAGEMENT THAT WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT TODAY I'VE BEEN LUCKY -- MY DAY TO DAY WORK HAS BEEN LAKE CANDLE IN THIS DARK TUNNEL THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM THAT DESPITE ITS. CHALLENGES HAS BEEN TRANSPARENT AND AND YOU KNOW WE CAN SEE SOME PROGRESS THERE -- BUT OTHER EXPERIENCES WITH DETAILS SHE HAS ALSO SHOWED OUR ORGANIZATION SOME CULTURAL ISSUES. WE TO BELIEVE IN OVERSIGHT AND TRANSPARENCY IN POLLUTER PAY AND WE SUPPORT. THAT MOVING FORWARD BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT WHAT I'VE ALSO WITNESSED IS TWO MONTHS -- pRESPONSIBLE PARTY CALLING THEM OUT ON A VIOLATION I'VE SEEN A RELUCTANCE. TO ACTUALLY ENFORCE THE LAW IT'S ONE THING TO NEGOTIATE WITH AN INDUSTRY TO TRY TO BRING THEM INTO COMPLIANCE IT'S ANOTHER THING TO DO THAT FOR TWO YEARS AND NEVER ENFORCED THE LAW THAT THIS LEGISLATURE. HAS PASSED SO I THINK WE WE NEED TO LOOK AT SOME CULTURAL CHANGES SOME STRUCTURAL CHANGES EVERYTHING YOU'VE HEARD SO FAR FROM -- ARE EACH A AND OTHER NGOS HERE WE WOULD ECHO AND WE THANK YOU FOR THIS HEARING WE THANK THE LEADERSHIP FOR PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS AND LOOKING FOR CHANGE AND WE WILL. LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT IN THREE YEARS AS MISSED ALLEY -- SAID WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE SAME THINGS THANK YOU. THANK YOU TURN NUMBERS NIKITA CROWDED WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL I'D LIKE TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF OUR PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS. IN THE CALL FOR GREATER OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY OF THE DEPARTMENT -- WE SUPPORT EFFORTS TO IMMEDIATELY ADDRESS THE GROWING STRUCTURAL DEFICIT AT THE DEPARTMENT SO THEY CAN ADEQUATELY FULFILL THEIR MANDATE TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT. BY POLLUTING PREVENTION OR BY PRESSING POLLUTION OUT WHENEVER POSSIBLE BY CLEANING UP A WASTE WHEN IT'S GENERATED AND BY REGULATING IT AND EFFECTIVE MANNER -- MUCH OF THE SITUATION SURROUNDING ACCESS EFFORT AT RTC HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN THE SANTA SUSANA FIELD LAB PROJECT FOR OVER TWO DECADES -- THAT WE HEARD SENATOR STERN TALK ABOUT AND WITH HALF A MILLION PEOPLE LIVING WITHIN TEN MILES OF THIS FACILITY IN AND AS ONE OF THE MOST CONTAMINATED SITES. IN THE STATE WE THINK FINANCIAL AND STRUCTURAL REFORM -- IMMEDIATELY IS IS ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE THOROUGH CLEANUP BUT ALSO FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THE TWENTY TEN AGREEMENT WITH THE STATE -- I'D LIKE TO ECHO THE COMMENTS BY EWG AND CLEAN WATER ACTION AND SAY THAT ENERGY STRONGLY SUPPORTS THIS STATES INNOVATIVE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM -- IT HAS TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL TO ADDRESS THE TOXICITY OF CHEMICALS AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS -- UP FRONT RATHER THAN AFTER THE FACT -- BUT THE PROGRAM IS FALLING SHORT AS YOU HEARD IN THE HEARING LAST WEEK AND WHILE SOME OF THIS -- IS DUE TO STRUCTURAL BARRIERS THAT WERE WORKING SEPARATELY TO ADDRESS THE LEGISLATION CENTER ON THIS YEAR IT'S ALSO BECAUSE OF INADEQUATE FUNDING. AND WE THINK BETTER AND AND MORE RESOURCES ARE NECESSARY TO ADDRESS UP THE PROBLEM WITH THAT CHEMICALS AND PRODUCTS OUT AHEAD OF TIME INSTEAD OF AFTER THE FACT AND SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU -- ON SUSTAINABLE FUNDING AND BETTER PERFORMANCE OF THE DEPARTMENT THIS YEAR THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME IS PHIL TELECOMMUTE CHIEF COMPLIANCE OFFICER CLEAN HARBORS SAFETY CLEAN. WE OPERATE FOURTEENTH TREATMENT STORAGE AND DISPOSAL FACILITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT NO WE COLLECT THIRTY MILLION GALLONS OF USED MOTOR OIL CONVERTED INTO RENEWABLE. MOTOR OIL IT'S USED IN ALL OF OUR CARS AND TRUCKS SO WE HAVE A VERY VESTED INTEREST IN MAKING SURE THE DETAILS HE IS SUCCESSFUL. AND THEY'RE HELD ACCOUNTABLE OF COURSE BUT I THINK YOU NEED TO HEAR SOMETHING FROM UP PERMIT TEASE POINT OF VIEW. OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS THE DEPARTMENT IS WORK VERY CAREFULLY. AT LEAST FOR OUR COMPANIES IN OUR IN OUR FACILITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO PERMITTING. THEY WORK WITH US TO TRY TO STREAMLINED PERMITTING FOR STANDARDIZED A BNC FACILITIES. MOST OF WHICH COLLECT USE MOTOR ALL. AND I THINK THEY'RE TO BE GIVEN A CHANCE TO REBUILD THEMSELVES. SECRETARY BLUMENFELD IS IT IS AN ACTION ORIENTED INDIVIDUAL. I THINK HE'LL DO A GREAT JOB OVER THE DEPARTMENT. I DO ALSO BELIEVE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS TO BE INVOLVED. IN IN DISCUSSION. WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE SURE. THAT THEY GET THE RESOURCES THEY NEED BECAUSE WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF PERMITTING WE WANT PERMITS PERMITS ALLOW US PREDICTABILITY. WE HAVE OVER FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY FACILITIES IN UNITED STATES. THAT ARE UNDER PERMITS BY STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES WE WANT THE PERMITS BECAUSE THEY HELP TO BUILD A FOUNDATION OF SUPPORT. AND RESPECT WITH THE COMMUNITY ALLOWS US TO DO MORE OUTRAGE. SO I HOPE THAT YOU'LL FIND A WAY TO PROVIDE THEM WITH BRIDGE FUNDING CITY CONTINUE TO MAKE THE CHANGES. THAT THE NEED TO MAKE AND I GOTTA SAY THEY'VE HIRED A LOT OF YOUNG. VERY ENERGETIC. ENGINEERS AND SCIENTISTS THERE AT A PLACE RIGHT NOW WITH THE NEED TO BE TO MAKE PROGRESS. SO CALLED FOR TO WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT.

WE URGE FOR ACTION THE WILL PROVIDE FOR MORE ADEQUATE OVERSIGHT OF THIS DEPARTMENT SPECIFICALLY WE REQUEST THAT YOU FOLLOW THE ADVICE OF THE DTS THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW PANEL. THAT RECOMMENDED THAT A GOVERNING BORDER OVERSIGHT BODY BE ESTABLISHED WITHIN DTS CA TO HELP ENSURE GREATER TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. AND REGULARLY MONITOR THE STATUS OF DTS HE'S PERFORMANCE INITIATIVES AND DECISION MAKING. ACCORDING TO THE RP THIS IS POSSIBLE CONSIDERING THE SIZE OF THE TSC IT'S HUMAN HEALTH PROTECTION MISSION AND THE NUMBER OF STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED AND CLEAN UP PERMITTING AND ENFORCEMENT WORK FOR PROJECTS SUCH AS EXIDE.

WHEN IS THERE CLEAN UP GONNA HAPPEN AND SO DO WE TELL COMMUNITIES THAT WE HAVE TO THEY HAVE TO CONTINUE TO WAIT? OR IS THERE SOMETHING THAT DTZ CAN DO AFFIRMATIVELY AND SO I TAKE I HAVE GREAT CONCERN WHEN I HEAR. THAT IN ORDER TO MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE DEFICIT THAT THERE HAS TO BE SOME CUTS -- TO THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. AND SO WHEN I'M ASKING -- FOR THE STATE AND FOR DTCS THAT WE CAN COME TO A SOLUTION. IN WHICH WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW. TO UPLIFT PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENSURE PUBLIC HEALTH FOR ALL OF THE COMMUNITIES BUT ALSO ENSURE THAT POLLUTING. INDUSTRIES ARE ACTUALLY MADE TO PAY AND FINDING A WAY TO GET THOSE FEES SO THE PROGRAMS CAN CONTINUE ON AND WE CAN PROTECT THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE WORK AND THINK YOU.
