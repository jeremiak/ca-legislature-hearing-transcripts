SCHEDULED HEARING I THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET STARTED WORRY HAVE THIS IS THE ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY COMMITTEE FOR WEDNESDAY SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH WE HAVE TWO BILLS IN FRONT OF US AB TWO FIFTY THREE WHICH IS WHY BILL AND THEN AB EIGHTEEN TWENTY. WHICH IS A COMMITTEE BILL. WHICH I WILL. PRESENT ADDRESS WOULD YOU TAKE THE GAVEL FORME ITEM NUMBER ONE AB TWO FIVE THREE STONE. THANK YOU. SO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WE KNOW THAT THE GOLD STANDARD IN CALIFORNIA FOR GETTING A RECORD. IS TO ENSURE THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE SOMEBODY IN THE COURT ROOM WHO IS. TRAINS AND MANAGING THE FILE AND MANAGING THAT RECORD TO THE BEST EXTENT POSSIBLE HOWEVER WE ALSO KNOW THAT IN THE NUMBER OF CASES WE DON'T HAVE THAT ABILITY WE'VE LONG BEEN TRYING TO FIND COURT REPORTERS IN FAMILY LAW WHERE IT BECOMES CRITICAL BECAUSE SO MANY. LITIGANTS ARE IMPROPER WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT COURTS HAVE. HAVE THAT ACCESS TO JUSTICE COMPONENT THAT A COURT REPORTER PROVIDES. BUT WE'RE NOT ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT PROVIDES A PILOT PROGRAM FOR SANTA CLARA COUNTY WHO IS INTERESTED AND WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE COURT REPORTERS AND WITH THE COUNTY TO TAILOR A PILOT PROGRAM SO THAT WE BETTER UNDERSTAND. HOW THIS CAN WORK FOR CALIFORNIA HOW WE CAN MANAGE HAVING KEEPING THAT STANDARD IS HIGHS ABSOLUTELY POSSIBLE AND YET MANAGE THE REALITIES GOING ON IN COURTS. SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I HAVE A. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE GOOD MORNING MICHELLE CAST OF THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION. WE HAVE THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL AS MR STONE SAID WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE COURT TO SEE IF. WE GIVE. WITHOUT ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU CAN WE ESTABLISH A QUORUM PLEASE STONE. GALLAGHER CHAO CHIU GONZALEZ. HOLDEN KALRA. KILEY MAIENSCHEIN OBERNOLTE PETRIE-NORRIS REYES HERE. THE BILL WE HAVE A MOTION. AND THE SECOND. COMES FROM THE PUBLIC COMMENT PLEASE. ANY OPPOSITION RATHER. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE COURT JEFFERSON ON BEHALF OF THE DISTRICT COUNCIL OR OFFICIAL POSITION IN SUPPORT OF AMENDED HOWEVER WE HAVE NOT YET HAD A CHANCE TO TAKE THE SEPTEMBER THIRD AMENDMENT TO OUR POLICY COMMITTEE WHICH MEETS TOMORROW AFTERNOON SO THAT STILL STAFF RECOMMENDATION TO MAINTAIN THE SUPPORT OF AMENDED AND AS NOTED THE ANALYSIS WERE BEING CONCERNED ABOUT A ONE COURT. PILOT WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED THAT THE PILOT IS LIMITED TO JUST FOR CASE TYPES THREE OF WHICH ARE ALREADY PERMITTED TO USE ELECTRONIC REPORTING AND THEN THE SIGNIFICANT FOR MY MOTHER WAS TAKEN ON SEPTEMBER THIRD TO DELETE THE TO YOUR SUNSET AND INSTEAD REPLACE IT WITH A PERMANENT STATUTORY BAN WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THAT. BRANCH AND WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR THE SPONSOR ON EXPANDING THE PILOT. TO GET INVOLVEMENT FROM MORE COURTS MEDIUM. IN A SMALL CORD SMALL OF LARGE COURTS MEDIUM CHORDS. NORTH SOUTH DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE STATE. THIS IS TECHNOLOGY THAT. THE COURTS HAVE USED IN THE PAST. AND A LOT OF NUMBER OF COURTS ARE VERY INTERESTED IN THE TECHNOLOGY. TO TRY TO FILL GAPS NGUYEN COURT REPORTERS ARE NOT AVAILABLE DUE TO REMOTE DISTANCES. AS WELL AS INCLEMENT WEATHER AND IN FACT IT WE HAVE USE THIS TECHNOLOGY. WHIMS SNOWSTORMS OF PREVENTED THE COURT REPORTER FROM GETTING OVER THE HILL TO TAHOE CITY. TO ALLOW THE PROCEEDING TO GO FORWARD AND PARTIES DON'T HAVE TO COME BACK FOR ANOTHER DAY. IN THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS ALSO BEEN USED. WHEN NAM CHILD VICTIMS OF SEX ABUSE. TESTIFIED TO CLOSE CIRCUIT TV WHEN THE COURT REPORTER WAS IN THE ROOM WITH THE CHILD. AND THE JUDGE IN THE REST OF THE PARTIES WERE IN THE COURT ROOM. SO JUST CONCERNED ABOUT A PERMANENT STATUTORY BAN AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES WOULD BE. AND WITH THAT WERE. YOU KNOW HOW TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND- YOU KNOW WE WILL. I GUESS GO ON THE RECORD ONCE OUR POLICY COMMITTEES HAD A CHANCE TO MEET. TOMORROW BUT FOR THE TIME BEING AT SUPPORT OF AMENDED. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. WAS TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT. SEEING NONE BRING IT BACK TO THE MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS YES MISTER WORLD. THANK YOU VERY CHAIR OF MR STONE I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE PILOT PROGRAM BUT I DO HAVE A QUESTION AS A FOLLOW ON TO THE TESTIMONY FROM THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL REGARDING THE SEPTEMBER THIRD AMENDMENT THAT ADDS THE STATUTORY PROHIBITION AGAINST USING REMARK COURT REPORTING OUTSIDE OF THE PILOT PROGRAM AND THAT. THAT ALARMED ME A LITTLE BIT CAN YOU TELL US WHY THAT WAS ADDED. IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM HERE. WITH THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST IN DOING REMOTE REPORTING AND UNFORTUNATELY NOT ALWAYS THE TECHNOLOGY DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK OFTENTIMES IT HAS JUST BEEN. CONFERENCE LINES OVER REGULAR TOOK TELEPHONY LINES. THAT ARE SUBJECT TO FAIL AND IF THAT'S WHAT'S BEING RELIED ON IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK WE WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT WE'RE SETTING UP A PILOT. AND SETTING. POLICY FOR MOVING FORWARD IF WE'RE GOING TO MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION. AND TO HAVE OTHER COUNTIES OR NOT HAVE CONTROL OVER HOW THIS HAPPENS AND ENSURING THE QUALITY. WHICH IS POTENTIALLY THE PATH WE'VE BEEN HEADED DOWN IT IS NOT GOING TO GIVE US THE DATA THAT WE ABSOLUTELY NEED THIS BUT AS YOU WELL KNOW. A CONTENTIOUS ISSUE OVER THE YEARS IN THIS COMMITTEE HAS SEEN IT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND WHAT WE'VE DONE. IS SPECIFICALLY CRAFTED A VERY NARROW. PROGRAM HERE WITH SIGNIFICANT BOUNCE AROUND IT SO THAT WE CAN CONTROL THAT WE CAN WORK WITH THE AFFECTED EMPLOYEES HERE WE CAN WORK WITH THE COURTS. AND SAID AN APPROPRIATE STANDARD FOR BEING ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD. SUPPORT OF THAT EFFORT AND THAT'S WHY I THINK THE PILOT PROGRAM IS A WONDERFUL IDEA NOT AN OCTAVE I SHARE YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT. ALL THE CONTROVERSY AROUND IT BUT- I'M I'M TRYING TO GET MY HEAD AROUND WHY WE WOULD ESTABLISH THE STATUTORY PROHIBITION AGAINST IT NOW. YOU KNOW BEFORE THE PILOT PROGRAM IS RUNNING I MEAN IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO ME THAT WHAT THE PILOT PROGRAM RUN ITS COURSE. HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT COME OUT OF THOSE PROGRAMS AND THEN. ESTABLISH SOME KIND OF STATUTORY FRAMEWORK FOR WHAT IS ALLOWED WITH LOCAL BEFORE COURT REPORTING AND NOT AND WHAT IS NOT ALLOWED. RATHER THAN YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW IS GOING ALL THE WAY TO THE OTHER SIDE SAYING OUTSIDE OF THOSE BULLETS PILOT PROGRAMS. NO ONE COULD DO ANY REMOTE ROCK COURT REPORTING AT ALL SO I'M GONNA I'M GONNA THINK ABOUT THAT BUT WE'RE MAKING IT CLEAR THAT THIS IS. THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO CONTEMPLATE IT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO KIND OF PLAYED ON THE TERMS THAT WE'RE CREATING HERE. THAT'S WHY THE BAND THAT'S WHY IT'S APPROPRIATE. IF THIS PILOT PROGRAM SUCCESSFUL AND WE MOVE FORWARD. THEN OBVIOUSLY WE WILL BE LIFTING THE BAN BUT WHAT WE DON'T WANT OR FOR COURTS TO STEP OUTSIDE OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. RUN THEIR OWN PILOTS WITHOUT THE CONTROLS WE HAVE BECAUSE WE'RE JUST GOING TO BE FURTHERING THE CONTROVERSY EARLY AND NOT ACTUALLY GETTING AND SO IN THOSE CASES WHEN WE HAVE COURTS THAT. DESIRE TO JOIN THE PILOT PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE NEXT YEAR IF THEY CAME BACK AND ASKED TO BE. ALLOWED TO JOIN ARE YOU GONNA BE OPEN TO ALLOWING THEM TO DO THAT. NEXT YEAR NOT. BECAUSE WE HAVE TO GIVE THIS AND NOT TIME TO WORK TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS OVER TIME POTENTIALLY AT THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING THE COURTS ABOUT WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO THE COUNTIES ABOUT YEAH. RIGHT WELL THINK ABOUT THAT THANK YOU MISTER NOBLE MISTER OBERNOLTE AND WE DID HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. THAT IF THERE WERE COURTS AND EMPLOYEES ARE MUTUALLY INTERESTED IN WE ACTUALLY WOULD. POTENTIALLY HAVE A CHAT ABOUT A BILL NEXT YEAR TO ADD ONE OR TWO QUARTS ARE EVEN MORE I KNOW. A FEW OF THEM HAVE EXPRESSED INTEREST AYE NO ONE HAS ACTUALLY REACHED OUT TO THE EMPLOYEES. AND ARE CONTEMPLATING THAT MATTEO SUPERIOR COURT AND THAT'S JUST A RELATIVELY NEW CONVERSATION. THE BETTER. ADAM MISTER STONE STATE IS. THIS IS A REALLY. NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT ONLY ONE TRIAL COURT. IN THE. IT'S USING REMOTE COURT REPORTING AND THAT IS COCHISE COUNTY COURT IN ARIZONA. AND USING SECURE LINES TO DO THAT. AND I'VE DONE A LOT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LINES ARE GONNA BE SECURE. THE CAN'T BE BREACHED THEY DON'T. YOU KNOW. LIKE THE WIFI DOESN'T GO OUT BUT WE'VE SEEN IN CALIFORNIA. WHERE IT HAS BEEN USE ONCE IT'S- BEEN BASICALLY. A CONFERENCE CALL. AND THE REPORTER CAN'T SEE WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE COURTROOM. WITH THE CONFERENCE LINE. OR IF YOUR USING IT JUST A REGULAR VIDEO CONFERENCING. THE WIFE I CAN GO OUT. AND EVERYONE IN THE COURTROOM MAY NOT KNOW. THAT FOR FIVE TO SEVEN MINUTES. WHICH IS WHY WITHOUT A- LIMITED. PILOT TO SEE HOW THIS REALLY ACTUALLY WORKS. WE GET IT RIGHT GOING FORWARD WE THOUGHT THAT WAS VERY IMPORTANT. OKAY THAT'S HELPFUL THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT WE HAVE A THE MOTION BY MISTER MAIENSCHEIN SECOND BY MS GONZALEZ WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE MISTER STONE I'D YES JUST ON THAT DATE WE TYPICALLY DO ONCE WE SET UP A PILOT IN THE LEGISLATURE THERE'S ALWAYS SOMEBODY WANTS A JOB JOINT ON THE NEXT YEAR AND THE NEXT YEAR IN THE NEXT YEAR AND I'LL JUST GO ON THE RECORD THAT WILL NOT NECESSARILY BE VERY WELL RECEIVED UNTIL AND UNLESS WE MAKE WE ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE DATA SO I DON'T WANT COUNTIES TO LINE UP AND SAY OH WE WANT TO SIGN ON NOW. I WILL SEE HOW THIS GOES I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE IMPLEMENTING IN THE RIGHT WAY BEFORE WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT SO DON'T THINK THAT IT'S GOING TO BE EASY TO JUMP ON BOARD UNLESS AND UNTIL WE COLLECT WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND THAT OTHERWISE WE ARE GOING TO GET BOGGED DOWN IN AND NOT MAKING PROGRESS IN WAYS THAT WE SHOULD THIS IS CAREFULLY DONE AND- I ASK FOR YOUR I'VE- I'VE.
