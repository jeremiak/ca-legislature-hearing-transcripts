00:37:54.572 --> 00:37:56.474
FIRST.

00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:58.275
GIVEN THAT A DRIVER'S LICENSE IS

00:37:58.342 --> 00:37:59.543
THE FIRST THING TO DO FOR

00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:02.413
SETTLING DOWN.

UNINSURED DRIVERS ON THE ROAD NO

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:30.528

UNINSURED DRIVERS TO DRIVE ON

00:40:31.695 --> 00:40:35.666

THANK YOU AND THEM THANK YOU.

00:40:45.476 --> 00:40:46.844
FOR OF COMING AND TESTIFYING

00:40:46.911 --> 00:40:49.613
FIRST PLACE I WENT AWAY FROM I

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:50.681
WAS A KID WAS.

00:40:50.748 --> 00:40:52.650
TO GRIP SOUTH KOREA SO I'M AND

00:40:52.716 --> 00:40:53.651
I'M VERY APPRECIATIVE THE

00:40:53.717 --> 00:40:55.719
CONNECTION YOU'RE TRYING.

00:40:55.786 --> 00:40:56.987
TO READ SHARE MY CONCERN IS YOU

00:40:57.054 --> 00:40:58.189
KNOW MY KIDS ARE GONNA BE ON THE

00:40:58.255 --> 00:41:00.891
ROAD AND ABOUT A YEAR AND I'M A

00:41:00.958 --> 00:41:02.226
LITTLE NERVOUS ABOUT THAT I I AM

00:41:02.293 --> 00:41:03.494
STEPS MUST BE EXCITED THAT THEY

00:41:03.561 --> 00:41:04.829
WILL DRIVE THEMSELVES PLACES BUT

00:41:04.895 --> 00:41:06.330
THEY HAVE TO TAKE THE TEST IN

00:41:06.397 --> 00:41:07.097
PART OF THE PURPOSE.

00:41:07.164 --> 00:41:10.901
OF IT OF THE DRIVING TASK.

00:41:10.968 --> 00:41:12.403
AT THE WRITTEN OR WAVING.

00:41:12.469 --> 00:41:15.239
IS TO I THINK TO SEE HOW THEY

00:41:15.306 --> 00:41:17.241
WILL OPERATE UNDER REAL

00:41:17.308 --> 00:41:19.944
CIRCUMSTANCES IN REAL PRESSURE --

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:21.011
REALIZING THAT THERE ARE SOME

00:41:21.078 --> 00:41:21.946
COUNTRIES THAT DON'T DRIVE ON

00:41:22.012 --> 00:41:22.947
THE SAME SIDE OF THE ROAD THAT

00:41:23.013 --> 00:41:24.248
WE DO THAT DON'T HAVE THE SAME

00:41:24.315 --> 00:41:25.850
RULES THREE TO MY UNDERSTANDING

00:41:25.916 --> 00:41:27.384
IS THAT THIS.

00:41:27.451 --> 00:41:28.552
LOOKS TO SEE IF THE TEST IS

00:41:28.619 --> 00:41:30.287
COMPARABLE.

00:41:30.354 --> 00:41:31.655
BUT NOT THE NECESSARILY THE SAME

00:41:31.722 --> 00:41:33.190
ACTUAL RULES OF THE OTHER

00:41:33.257 --> 00:41:34.592
COUNTRY --

00:41:34.658 --> 00:41:36.994
CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT BECAUSE I I

00:41:37.061 --> 00:41:38.128
WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY WE'RE NOT

00:41:38.195 --> 00:41:39.363
REQUIRING THE SAME RULES BE

00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:40.965
FOLLOWED.

00:41:41.031 --> 00:41:42.933
AND AND HOW I WOULD GET OVER THE

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.535
CONCERN THAT SOMEONE WILL BE ON

00:41:44.602 --> 00:41:45.803
THE ROAD THE SAME ROAD THAT MY

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:46.337
KIDS ARE GOING TO BE ON MY

00:41:46.403 --> 00:41:48.038
CONSTITUENTS.

00:41:48.105 --> 00:41:49.840
WHO HAS NOT TAKEN A REAL LIFE

00:41:49.907 --> 00:41:51.108
TEST HERE UNDER OUR RULES AND

00:41:51.175 --> 00:41:53.510
BILL TRAFFIC CONDITIONS?

00:41:53.577 --> 00:41:54.612
AND I WOULD SAY TWO THINGS

00:41:54.678 --> 00:41:56.113
NUMBER ONE THAT'S NO DIFFERENT

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:57.715
THAN THE PERSON FROM KANSAS.

00:41:57.781 --> 00:42:00.184
OR FLORIDA OR SOUTH DAKOTA WHEN

00:42:00.251 --> 00:42:01.085
THEY COME HERE IT'S EXACTLY THE

00:42:01.151 --> 00:42:03.053
SAME THAT WE TREAT THAT WE WOULD

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:04.955
BE TREATING THEM --

00:42:05.022 --> 00:42:06.457
THIS MEANS THAT THE COUNTRY HAS

00:42:06.523 --> 00:42:08.826
HAVE A VERIFIED BEHIND THE WHEEL

00:42:08.893 --> 00:42:10.628
PROGRAM SIMILAR TO OURS --

00:42:10.694 --> 00:42:11.729
OTHER STATES HAVE DIFFERENT

00:42:11.795 --> 00:42:13.530
DRIVING RULES THOSE PEOPLE SOFT

00:42:13.597 --> 00:42:15.232
TAKE THE WRITTEN TEST. TO MAKE

00:42:15.299 --> 00:42:16.133
SURE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:18.435
CALIFORNIA'S LAWS.

00:42:18.502 --> 00:42:19.904
SAME WOULD APPLY HERE --

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:21.038
THESE FOLKS FROM WHATEVER

00:42:21.105 --> 00:42:22.640
COUNTRY THAT MEETS THE CRITERIA

00:42:22.706 --> 00:42:23.540
WOULD STILL HAVE TO TAKE THE

00:42:23.607 --> 00:42:25.242
WRITTEN TEST SO FOR EXAMPLE NOT

00:42:25.309 --> 00:42:26.043
EVERY STATE HAS RIGHT TURN ON

00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:27.278
RED --

00:42:27.344 --> 00:42:28.746
DIFFERENT STATES HAVE DIFFERENT

00:42:28.812 --> 00:42:30.447
DRIVING LAWS WE DON'T WE DON'T

00:42:30.514 --> 00:42:33.117
LEVEL THIS ANY DIFFERENTLY IF

00:42:33.183 --> 00:42:34.485
YOU WERE FROM NEBRASKA.

00:42:34.551 --> 00:42:36.453
OR SOUTH DAKOTA SO WHICH

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:38.255
TREATING THESE FOLKS EXACTLY THE

00:42:38.322 --> 00:42:40.758
SAME WAY.

00:42:40.824 --> 00:42:42.192
I APPRECIATE THAT I I DO SEE A

00:42:42.259 --> 00:42:43.560
DIFFERENCE WE HAVE AT LEAST HAVE

00:42:43.627 --> 00:42:45.129
A UNIFORMITY.

00:42:45.195 --> 00:42:46.497
OF SIGNAGE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GO

00:42:46.563 --> 00:42:47.798
OVER TO EUROPE YOU COVERAGE PAN

00:42:47.865 --> 00:42:48.432
YOU COULD EITHER COUNTRIES THE

00:42:48.499 --> 00:42:49.900
SCIENCE THE THE WAY THEY MARK

00:42:49.967 --> 00:42:51.402
THEIR LINES ON THE STREETS ARE

00:42:51.468 --> 00:42:53.304
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT AND AGAIN

00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:54.471
THERE MAY BE DRIVING ON THE

00:42:54.538 --> 00:42:56.874
OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD --

00:42:56.941 --> 00:42:59.677
AND INTESTINE NOT THAT.

00:42:59.743 --> 00:43:02.379
BETWEEN ARE EVERYWHERE ELSE IN

00:43:02.446 --> 00:43:04.415
THE FIFTY STATES AND AND WITH

00:43:04.481 --> 00:43:06.016
OTHER COUNTRIES.

00:43:06.083 --> 00:43:07.651
WHICH CONCERNS ME AND I DON'T

00:43:07.718 --> 00:43:09.420
KNOW IF YOU CAN CAN ADDRESS JUST

00:43:09.486 --> 00:43:10.020
WHAT.

00:43:10.087 --> 00:43:11.989
ARE MAYBE THAT WAS THAT THE

00:43:12.056 --> 00:43:13.223
EFFORT BUT WHAT.

00:43:13.290 --> 00:43:15.059
WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE SEE UNDER

00:43:15.125 --> 00:43:16.560
REAL CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SOMEONE

00:43:16.627 --> 00:43:18.762
IN THE REAL FIELD IN OUR AREA IS

00:43:18.829 --> 00:43:19.897
GOING TO BE ABLE TO OPERATE

00:43:19.964 --> 00:43:21.298
SAFELY ON THE ROADS AND THAT'S

00:43:21.365 --> 00:43:23.067
WHERE THE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR

00:43:23.133 --> 00:43:24.969
PROGRAM COMES INTO EFFECT --

00:43:25.035 --> 00:43:27.371
D. M. V. WILL BE MAKING SURE

00:43:27.438 --> 00:43:28.872
THAT WHATEVER COUNTRIES APPLYING

00:43:28.939 --> 00:43:31.575
FOR THIS MEETS OUR STANDARDS.

00:43:31.642 --> 00:43:32.843
THAT'S THE SAFEGUARD THEY HAVE

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:34.211
TO MEET OUR STATE I PERSONALLY

00:43:34.278 --> 00:43:36.413
SPOKE IN THE EXAMPLE OF KOREA

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:38.215
MET WITH THEIR TRAFFIC FOLKS

00:43:38.282 --> 00:43:39.817
PERSONALLY AND TALKED ABOUT.

00:43:39.883 --> 00:43:41.652
HOW THEY DO IT AND IT IS MODELED

00:43:41.719 --> 00:43:43.053
ON OUR PROGRAM SO?

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.421
THAT'S THE SAFEGUARD HERE IS

00:43:44.488 --> 00:43:46.056
THEY HAVE TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY

00:43:46.123 --> 00:43:49.426
SIMILAR WITH CALIFORNIA DOES --

00:43:49.493 --> 00:43:50.594
TO GET THIS BENEFIT IF THEY

00:43:50.661 --> 00:43:52.062
DON'T AND IF THEY DON'T PROVIDE

00:43:52.129 --> 00:43:53.197
ALL OF THE DOCUMENTATION OF THEY

00:43:53.263 --> 00:43:53.430
DON'T.

00:43:53.497 --> 00:43:55.099
PROVIDE THEIR DRIVING RECORDS IF

00:43:55.165 --> 00:43:56.200
THEY DON'T PROVIDE WHICH

00:43:56.266 --> 00:43:58.002
INCLUDES THEIR ANY POINTS THAT

00:43:58.068 --> 00:43:59.436
WOULD BE APPLICABLE --

00:43:59.503 --> 00:44:00.637
SO I THINK THE CRITERIA IS

00:44:00.704 --> 00:44:04.308
PRETTY STRONG AND STRINGENT AND

00:44:04.375 --> 00:44:06.443
SORT OF FOLLOWS OF LOGICAL.

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:08.278
A ASSUMPTIONS --

00:44:08.345 --> 00:44:10.481
AND AGAIN IT'S NO DIFFERENT THAN.

00:44:10.547 --> 00:44:14.351
YOU KNOW NEBRASKA OR FLORIDA.

00:44:14.418 --> 00:44:14.985
AMANDA STILL THINK I GUESS IT IS

00:44:15.052 --> 00:44:16.053
DIFFERENT IN THE SENSE THAT YOU

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:17.388
MAY HAVE COUNTRIES THAT HAVE

00:44:17.454 --> 00:44:19.023
VERY DIFFERENT FOUND.

00:44:19.089 --> 00:44:19.990
AND SIGNAGE RULES BUT THAT MAY

00:44:20.057 --> 00:44:21.291
JUST BE -- A

00:44:21.358 --> 00:44:22.693
FAIR POINT IF OF LOOKING AT IT

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:23.527
DIFFERENTLY.

00:44:23.594 --> 00:44:26.163
AND THEN THAT IF YOU CAN ALSO IT

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:29.600
CLARIFIER WHY WE ARE LOOKING AT

00:44:29.666 --> 00:44:30.901
MAKING SURE THAT IF THERE LAWS

00:44:30.968 --> 00:44:34.204
AND TESTING IS THE SAME BUT THE

00:44:34.271 --> 00:44:35.372
THEIR THEIR TEST PROCEDURES.

00:44:35.439 --> 00:44:36.673
AND NOT THEIR ACTUAL RULES OF

00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:39.543
THE ROAD --

00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:41.345
Y. THAT TREATING THOSE TWO

00:44:41.412 --> 00:44:42.346
DIFFERENTLY UNDER YOUR BILL

00:44:42.413 --> 00:44:43.680
BECAUSE I THINK THE POINT IS

00:44:43.747 --> 00:44:45.682
THAT NOT EVERY COUNTRY NOT EVERY

00:44:45.749 --> 00:44:47.651
STATE HAS EXACTLY THE SAME RULES

00:44:47.718 --> 00:44:48.819
OF THE ROAD THE QUESTION IS

00:44:48.886 --> 00:44:50.421
WHETHER THESE ARE COMPETENT.

00:44:50.487 --> 00:44:53.323
SAFE DRIVERS VERIFIED BY FIVE

00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:55.159
YEARS OF DRIVING HISTORY.

00:44:55.225 --> 00:44:57.961
VERIFIED BY THE TRAINING. TO A

00:44:58.028 --> 00:44:58.562
PROGRAM THAT'S COMPARABLE TO

00:44:58.629 --> 00:44:59.997
OURS.

00:45:00.064 --> 00:45:01.165
I MEAN YOU NEVER GONNA HAVE AN

00:45:01.231 --> 00:45:03.734
EXACT MATCH BUT THIS.

00:45:03.801 --> 00:45:04.968
PROVIDE SUBSTANTIALLY SAID THIS

00:45:05.035 --> 00:45:06.904
PROVIDES CONTROLS AND THAT WAS

00:45:06.970 --> 00:45:07.538
ONE OF THE THINGS WORKING WITH

00:45:07.604 --> 00:45:09.139
THIS COMMITTEE THAT WE CAME UP

00:45:09.206 --> 00:45:10.841
WITH WITH THAT DEFINITION. TO

00:45:10.908 --> 00:45:12.476
APPLY EVENLY THERE ARE GONNA BE

00:45:12.543 --> 00:45:14.044
COUNTRIES THAT JUST CANNOT APPLY

00:45:14.111 --> 00:45:15.045
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO

00:45:15.112 --> 00:45:16.313
MEET THOSE STANDARDS.

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:17.815
THAT'S THEIR PROBLEM NOT OURS

00:45:17.881 --> 00:45:18.882
BUT FOR THE COUNTRIES THAT MEET

00:45:18.949 --> 00:45:20.617
THE MINIMUM STANDARDS.

00:45:20.684 --> 00:45:21.885
AND SUPPLY ALL OF THIS

00:45:21.952 --> 00:45:23.854
DOCUMENTATION FOR CALIFORNIA

00:45:23.921 --> 00:45:25.022
WHICH IS WHEN YOU KNOW THE

00:45:25.089 --> 00:45:26.356
EIGHTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE

00:45:26.423 --> 00:45:27.491

NATIONALS AND A MYRIAD OF

00:45:30.928 --> 00:45:32.463
BUSINESSES THIS IS A WAY TO

00:45:32.529 --> 00:45:34.231
FACILITATE SOME OF CALIFORNIA'S

00:45:34.298 --> 00:45:36.033
TRADE IN FRIENDSHIP AND AN

00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:37.134
ESPRIT DE CORPS WITH THESE

00:45:37.201 --> 00:45:38.368
COUNTRIES THAT DO BUSINESS WITH

00:45:38.435 --> 00:45:38.535
US.

00:45:38.602 --> 00:45:40.003
IN A WAY THAT I THINK HAS A

00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:41.505
APPROPRIATE SAFEGUARDS

BEFORE MISSION THE DRIVING TEST

00:45:54.885 --> 00:45:56.620

00:45:58.689 --> 00:46:00.057
SOMEONE PROVE INSURANCE.

00:46:00.124 --> 00:46:01.291
WE CAN CLARIFY THAT BECAUSE

00:46:01.358 --> 00:46:02.626
THERE'S NO INTENTION TO HAVE ANY

00:46:02.693 --> 00:46:06.029

YOU KNOW WE DON'T SEE THAT AS A

00:46:17.341 --> 00:46:18.809
AS A BARRIER NOT TO CLEAR UP IF

00:46:21.478 --> 00:46:23.413

FURTHER EMPOWERS CARP --

01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:27.463
AND ONE OF THE THINGS I SEE FROM

01:09:27.530 --> 01:09:28.931
THE IS THE FROM IT WILL THE

01:09:28.998 --> 01:09:30.900
STATE LEGISLATORS I I FEEL LIKE.

01:09:30.966 --> 01:09:33.002
I I'M ACCOUNTABLE CARB CARDS ON

01:09:33.068 --> 01:09:34.303
ACCOUNTABLE TO ME.

01:09:34.370 --> 01:09:36.305
AS A STATE LEGISLATOR OR EVEN

01:09:36.372 --> 01:09:37.840
THE STATE LEGISLATURE.

01:09:37.907 --> 01:09:39.942
AND MY WORRY IS THAT THIS

01:09:40.009 --> 01:09:42.378
FURTHERS THAT DYNAMIC --

01:09:42.444 --> 01:09:44.680
OF A LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY IN

01:09:44.747 --> 01:09:46.115
WHERE WE WERE HEADING OVER.

01:09:46.181 --> 01:09:47.683
SOME SIGNIFICANT AUTHORITY AND I

01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:48.584
JUST DON'T KNOW THERE'S MANY

01:09:48.651 --> 01:09:49.785
BARRIERS ON AND I DON'T KNOW

01:09:49.852 --> 01:09:51.387
WHERE TO GO.

01:09:51.453 --> 01:09:52.221
I MEAN YOU COULD SAY THAT ABOUT

01:09:52.288 --> 01:09:53.355
ANY BILL BUT I THINK IN THIS

01:09:53.422 --> 01:09:54.390
CASE IT'S PRETTY EXPLICIT

01:09:54.456 --> 01:09:56.358
THEY'RE HANDING THEM A A MISSION.

01:09:56.425 --> 01:09:59.261
AND AND AND AND AGAIN MY CONCERN

01:09:59.328 --> 01:10:00.729
IS IS WHERE DOES THIS GO.

01:10:00.796 --> 01:10:01.830
TO YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT

01:10:01.897 --> 01:10:04.934
AND DO CARE TO WORLD SO THE THE

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.970
BILL DOES NOT --

01:10:08.037 --> 01:10:09.071
AUTHORITY SO IN OTHER WORDS A

01:10:09.138 --> 01:10:10.306
ARE BE.

01:10:10.372 --> 01:10:12.908
THE REGULATORY ENTITY THAT IS

01:10:12.975 --> 01:10:15.311
RESPONSIBLE FOR REGULATING TMZ'S

01:10:15.377 --> 01:10:18.414
REMAINS THE P. UC SO ANY.

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:19.248
ANY --

01:10:19.315 --> 01:10:21.317
ADMINISTRATION ANY ADOPTION OF

01:10:21.383 --> 01:10:23.085
REGULATIONS OR ADMINISTRATION OF

01:10:23.152 --> 01:10:25.087
REGULATIONS WOULD STILL SQUARE

01:10:25.154 --> 01:10:27.456
STAY SQUARELY WITH THE PC.

01:10:27.523 --> 01:10:29.358
WHAT CARBS RULE WOULD BE IN THIS

01:10:29.425 --> 01:10:30.993
IS UPON THE RECOMMENDATION IN

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:32.361
NEGOTIATIONS WITH OUR TNC

01:10:32.428 --> 01:10:33.829
COMPANIES?

01:10:33.896 --> 01:10:37.533
BECAUSE THE OBJECTIVE YES IT IS

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:40.469
I'VE CHARACTERIZED IT AS ZEV PSE

01:10:40.536 --> 01:10:42.538
AND CLEAN MILES IT REALLY IS

01:10:42.605 --> 01:10:44.173
THAT YOUR QUALITY ISSUE.

01:10:44.239 --> 01:10:46.075
SO BECAUSE TAILPIPE EMISSIONS

01:10:46.141 --> 01:10:48.310
STILL ARE THE NUMBER ONE SOURCE

01:10:48.377 --> 01:10:50.312
OF AIR POLLUTING EMISSIONS.

01:10:50.379 --> 01:10:52.481
AND CALIFORNIA'S STILL HAS A

01:10:52.548 --> 01:10:55.985
LARGE MAJORITY OF ITS --

01:10:56.051 --> 01:10:57.653
GEOGRAPHIC AREAS IN NON

01:10:57.720 --> 01:10:59.388
ATTAINMENT DISTRICTS SO WHAT.

01:10:59.455 --> 01:11:01.290
A ARBY'S ROLE WOULD BE IS TO

01:11:01.357 --> 01:11:02.858
WORK WITH THE TNC EAST TO SET A

01:11:02.925 --> 01:11:05.728
BASELINE OF THEIR EMISSIONS

01:11:05.794 --> 01:11:07.463
PROFILE AT PRESENT.

01:11:07.529 --> 01:11:09.698
AND THEN TO WORK OUT AS

01:11:09.765 --> 01:11:11.734
RECOMMENDED SET OF GOALS FOR HOW

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:13.836
DO TO IN EFFECT CLEAN THOSE

01:11:13.902 --> 01:11:15.704
SMILES BRING DOWN THE EMISSIONS

01:11:15.771 --> 01:11:17.272
OF THOSE MILES.

01:11:17.339 --> 01:11:20.409
WHICH THEN THE P. YOU SEE WOULD --

01:11:20.476 --> 01:11:21.410
BASICALLY --

01:11:21.477 --> 01:11:23.379
ADMINISTER THOUGH THE WAY IT'S

01:11:23.445 --> 01:11:25.314
WRITTEN THEY DON'T HAVE.

01:11:25.381 --> 01:11:28.117
TO JUST GUT THERE'S FLEXIBILITY

01:11:28.183 --> 01:11:30.219
IN TERMS OF THE TIMING AND IN

01:11:30.285 --> 01:11:33.122

COST VEHICLES RANGE AND THAT

01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:39.928
