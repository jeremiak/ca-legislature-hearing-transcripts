00:30:02.134 --> 00:30:05.771 region:rollup2
ALL IN NOTICES WOULD GO OUT AND.

00:30:04.736 --> 00:30:07.873 region:rollup2
HOW WE GONNA HANDLE?

00:30:05.771 --> 00:30:09.107 region:rollup2
THE COMBINED EFFORTS SO WHAT

00:30:07.873 --> 00:30:11.009 region:rollup2
WOULD BE THAT MATRIX FOR THAT I

00:30:09.107 --> 00:30:12.644 region:rollup2
GOT SEVERAL QUESTIONS OKAY SO

00:30:11.009 --> 00:30:14.880 region:rollup2
WELL ACTUALLY ONE OF THE THINGS

00:30:12.644 --> 00:30:16.481 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAD. ENGLISH WILL ALWAYS

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:17.816 region:rollup2
BE THAT WERE THE PRIMARY

00:30:16.481 --> 00:30:19.785 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE AND SO THIS IS IN

00:30:17.816 --> 00:30:20.952 region:rollup2
ADDITION TO ENGLISH AND SO THAT

00:30:19.785 --> 00:30:22.721 region:rollup2
FORTY FOUR PERCENT NUMBER WE

00:30:20.952 --> 00:30:24.656 region:rollup2
HAVE ACTUALLY CAME FROM THE

00:30:22.721 --> 00:30:26.425 region:rollup2
TWENTY TEN. US CENSUS AND SO

00:30:24.656 --> 00:30:28.160 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHERE WE KNOW ALL OF THE

00:30:26.425 --> 00:30:31.229 region:rollup2
COUNTIES HAVE THAT INFORMATION

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:32.798 region:rollup2
AND WE ALSO HAD TO HAVE AN IDEA

00:30:31.229 --> 00:30:34.399 region:rollup2
THAT WE WILL TAKE AYE IF THIS

00:30:32.798 --> 00:30:36.068 region:rollup2
BILL MOVES FORWARD. AYE TODAY

00:30:34.399 --> 00:30:37.336 region:rollup2
WILL TAKE TO THE NEXT COMMITTEE

00:30:36.068 --> 00:30:40.739 region:rollup2
WHICH IS A PREPARATION THAT IT

00:30:37.336 --> 00:30:42.908 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE EITHER TRANSLATION AND

00:30:40.739 --> 00:30:44.543 region:rollup2
OR. ON A LANGUAGE ASSESSMENT

00:30:42.908 --> 00:30:45.610 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT

00:30:44.543 --> 00:30:47.746 region:rollup2
ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN

00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:49.414 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA MAY HAVE UNIQUE NEEDS

00:30:47.746 --> 00:30:52.084 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THERE ARE SOME COUNTIES

00:30:49.414 --> 00:30:54.386 region:rollup2
WHERE. I YOU KNOW OF SPANISH MAY

00:30:52.084 --> 00:30:55.687 region:rollup2
BE ONE OF THEM BUT IT'S UP THERE

00:30:54.386 --> 00:30:57.622 region:rollup2
WITH A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE.

00:30:55.687 --> 00:31:00.258 region:rollup2
AND SO THEY MAY NEED TO HAVE A

00:30:57.622 --> 00:31:02.361 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT RESPONSE OF THE IDEA

00:31:00.258 --> 00:31:03.995 region:rollup2
IT IS REALLY THAT THE COUNTIES

00:31:02.361 --> 00:31:06.198 region:rollup2
WILL HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY TO

00:31:03.995 --> 00:31:08.900 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY WHETHER A SIMPLE

00:31:06.198 --> 00:31:10.969 region:rollup2
TRANSLATION ON EVERYTHING IS

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:13.605 region:rollup2
EXACTLY WHAT THEY NEED TO DO OR.

00:31:10.969 --> 00:31:15.307 region:rollup2
THEY WILL INCLUDE AND LANGUAGE

00:31:13.605 --> 00:31:18.510 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT AS PART OF THEIR

00:31:15.307 --> 00:31:21.580 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY PLAN AND THAT LANGUAGE

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:25.283 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT WILL HAVE WHATEVER

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:26.585 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC NEED GAMINI IDENTIFY

00:31:25.283 --> 00:31:29.755 region:rollup2
FOR EXACT COUNT.

00:31:26.585 --> 00:31:30.389 region:rollup2
SO HELP WALK US THROUGH.

00:31:29.755 --> 00:31:32.524 region:rollup2
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE TWENTY

00:31:30.389 --> 00:31:33.091 region:rollup2
TEN CENTS IS WE'RE JUST AROUND

00:31:32.524 --> 00:31:33.725 region:rollup2
THE CORNER FROM AND WHEN HE

00:31:33.091 --> 00:31:35.927 region:rollup2
TWENTY.

00:31:33.725 --> 00:31:36.862 region:rollup2
CENSUS AND THAT WILL BE.

00:31:35.927 --> 00:31:37.429 region:rollup2
HOW FOR REFERENCES BY TWENTY

00:31:36.862 --> 00:31:38.563 region:rollup2
TWENTY ONE WERE VERY CLOSE I

00:31:37.429 --> 00:31:39.030 region:rollup2
HAD?

00:31:38.563 --> 00:31:40.098 region:rollup2
?

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:41.433 region:rollup2
ARE WE GONNA WANNA.

00:31:40.098 --> 00:31:42.300 region:rollup2
DO THIS TWICE.

00:31:41.433 --> 00:31:44.069 region:rollup2
BASING IT OFF OF THE TWENTY TEN

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:45.270 region:rollup2
AND THEN.

00:31:44.069 --> 00:31:45.837 region:rollup2
BUT AGAIN HAVE TO REALLY CHANGE

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:47.339 region:rollup2
THINGS AND GO TO THE TWENTY

00:31:45.837 --> 00:31:48.507 region:rollup2
TWENTY ONE.

00:31:47.339 --> 00:31:49.775 region:rollup2
SINCE THIS YEAH I WOULD LOVE FOR

00:31:48.507 --> 00:31:51.176 region:rollup2
THERE TO BE NO MORE NATURAL

00:31:49.775 --> 00:31:52.677 region:rollup2
DISASTERS ON BETWEEN NOW AND THE

00:31:51.176 --> 00:31:53.712 region:rollup2
NEXT CENSUS THAT WOULD BE MY

00:31:52.677 --> 00:31:54.813 region:rollup2
DREAM. ON BUT HAVING LIVED THIS

00:31:53.712 --> 00:31:55.414 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THERE IS AN URGENCY

00:31:54.813 --> 00:31:56.381 region:rollup2
TO DO SOMETHING NOW AND THESE

00:31:55.414 --> 00:31:57.749 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY PLANS ARE SOMETHING

00:31:56.381 --> 00:31:59.351 region:rollup2
THAT COUNTIES ACTUALLY.

00:31:57.749 --> 00:32:01.286 region:rollup2
HAVE TO CONDUCT AN UPDATE ON A

00:31:59.351 --> 00:32:02.788 region:rollup2
REGULAR BASIS SO THIS WOULD BE

00:32:01.286 --> 00:32:05.290 region:rollup2
ONE MORE ELEMENT THAT THEY WOULD

00:32:02.788 --> 00:32:06.591 region:rollup2
INCLUDE IN THAT EMERGENCY PLAN

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:08.693 region:rollup2
TO IDENTIFY HOW THEY WILL GET

00:32:06.591 --> 00:32:09.961 region:rollup2
THAT INFORMATION OUT BUT YES. ON

00:32:08.693 --> 00:32:12.230 region:rollup2
THAT THE PLAN IS TO DO IT RIGHT

00:32:09.961 --> 00:32:13.532 region:rollup2
AWAY BUT IN ADDITION ON UPDATE

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:15.267 region:rollup2
THAT INFORMATION THAT COUNTIES

00:32:13.532 --> 00:32:16.601 region:rollup2
WILL GENERALLY UPDATE ALL OF

00:32:15.267 --> 00:32:18.503 region:rollup2
THEIR COUNTY INFORMATION TO

00:32:16.601 --> 00:32:21.907 region:rollup2
INCLUDE THE TWENTY. FIVE TWENTY

00:32:18.503 --> 00:32:22.674 region:rollup2
CENSUS SO WITH THAT LET'S GO TO

00:32:21.907 --> 00:32:24.209 region:rollup2
THE COUNTY BY COUNTY.

00:32:22.674 --> 00:32:26.011 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IN SOME CASES DURING THE

00:32:24.209 --> 00:32:26.945 region:rollup2
DISASTER PREPAREDNESS TRAILS AND

00:32:26.011 --> 00:32:27.345 region:rollup2
HAVING WRITTEN SOME OF THOSE

00:32:26.945 --> 00:32:28.480 region:rollup2
MIDDLE PART OF IT.

00:32:27.345 --> 00:32:29.915 region:rollup2
.

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:30.482 region:rollup2
I KNOW THAT IN SOME CASES WE

00:32:29.915 --> 00:32:32.350 region:rollup2
HAVE TO MAKE THE ASSUMPTION

00:32:30.482 --> 00:32:33.652 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:35.987 region:rollup2
THE LOCAL COUNTY CAN'T TAKE CARE

00:32:33.652 --> 00:32:37.088 region:rollup2
OF ITSELF THERE FOR ALL SYSTEMS

00:32:35.987 --> 00:32:38.857 region:rollup2
ARE DOWN WHIP RUN THE NEXT.

00:32:37.088 --> 00:32:39.791 region:rollup2
NEIGHBORING COUNTY IN A

00:32:38.857 --> 00:32:41.159 region:rollup2
NEIGHBORING COUNTY MAY NOT HAVE

00:32:39.791 --> 00:32:43.195 region:rollup2
A SYSTEM THAT'S DESIGNED TO THE

00:32:41.159 --> 00:32:45.697 region:rollup2
SAME LANGUAGE CAPABILITIES

00:32:43.195 --> 00:32:46.798 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S.

00:32:45.697 --> 00:32:47.732 region:rollup2
DENNIS MODELING HUMAN HASN'T

00:32:46.798 --> 00:32:49.601 region:rollup2
COME OUT THAT WAY.

00:32:47.732 --> 00:32:51.136 region:rollup2
HOW ARE WE GONNA REMEDY THAT ANY

00:32:49.601 --> 00:32:52.471 region:rollup2
CASE THAT FAILS AS WELL THEN

00:32:51.136 --> 00:32:54.773 region:rollup2
THERE'S THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY

00:32:52.471 --> 00:32:56.408 region:rollup2
SERVICES WHICH HAS THE THIRD

00:32:54.773 --> 00:32:57.809 region:rollup2
OVERLAY IN THE SYSTEM?

00:32:56.408 --> 00:32:59.110 region:rollup2
AND THEY MAY NOT HAVE ANY OF

00:32:57.809 --> 00:33:00.912 region:rollup2
THIS SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO

00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:03.048 region:rollup2
COORDINATE THAT NOW BECAUSE IT'S

00:33:00.912 --> 00:33:04.015 region:rollup2
NOT REALLY CLEAR.

00:33:03.048 --> 00:33:05.383 region:rollup2
RIGHT IN AND AND AND ACTUALLY I

00:33:04.015 --> 00:33:06.785 region:rollup2
WILL SAY THAT IN THE OFFICE OF

00:33:05.383 --> 00:33:08.320 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY SERVICES THE DO SO

00:33:06.785 --> 00:33:09.688 region:rollup2
WHAT WE LEARNED WITH THE THOMAS

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:12.891 region:rollup2
FIRE AND THE DEGREE FLOWS.

00:33:09.688 --> 00:33:14.025 region:rollup2
IS THAT THE THE CHALLENGE WAS

00:33:12.891 --> 00:33:16.428 region:rollup2
NOT THAT WE DIDN'T IDENTIFY THAT

00:33:14.025 --> 00:33:18.430 region:rollup2
THIS THAT CRITICAL TRANSLATED

00:33:16.428 --> 00:33:19.097 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE WAS NEEDED IT WAS THAT

00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:20.665 region:rollup2
IT WASN'T PART OF THE

00:33:19.097 --> 00:33:21.933 region:rollup2
COORDINATION SO THIS BILL WOULD

00:33:20.665 --> 00:33:23.735 region:rollup2
FORCE IT TO BE PART OF THE

00:33:21.933 --> 00:33:26.204 region:rollup2
COORDINATION. AND THE EVERY

00:33:23.735 --> 00:33:27.405 region:rollup2
COUNTY WOULD HAVE AND I THINK

00:33:26.204 --> 00:33:28.874 region:rollup2
THAT IF THE COUNTY DOES HAVE TO

00:33:27.405 --> 00:33:30.308 region:rollup2
GO TO ANOTHER COUNTY THAT WILL

00:33:28.874 --> 00:33:30.809 region:rollup2
ALSO BE PART OF THE

00:33:30.308 --> 00:33:32.444 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION WHAT WHAT

00:33:30.809 --> 00:33:34.012 region:rollup2
SERVICES.

00:33:32.444 --> 00:33:36.081 region:rollup2
I DO THE OTHER COUNTIES HAVE

00:33:34.012 --> 00:33:38.650 region:rollup2
WHAT IS THEIR PLAN HAVE ON IT

00:33:36.081 --> 00:33:40.252 region:rollup2
FROM WORKING IT KIND OF ON THE

00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:42.621 region:rollup2
GROUND WITH FOLKS I REALIZED.

00:33:40.252 --> 00:33:44.256 region:rollup2
THAT IT WAS RELEASED A SIMPLE

00:33:42.621 --> 00:33:45.524 region:rollup2
KIND OF JUST LET'S GET THIS

00:33:44.256 --> 00:33:47.459 region:rollup2
INFORMATION OUT SO I REMEMBER.

00:33:45.524 --> 00:33:48.426 region:rollup2
WHEN CAL FIRE STARTED GIVING

00:33:47.459 --> 00:33:50.629 region:rollup2
OUT THE INFORMATION THE

00:33:48.426 --> 00:33:51.530 region:rollup2
SCHEDULED WEEKLY SIX O'CLOCK

00:33:50.629 --> 00:33:53.164 region:rollup2
NEWS.

00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:54.366 region:rollup2
ONLINE CONFERENCES IN SPANISH

00:33:53.164 --> 00:33:56.201 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY DID HAVE SOMEONE

00:33:54.366 --> 00:33:56.701 region:rollup2
WHO COULD SPEAK SPANISH BUT IT

00:33:56.201 --> 00:33:58.036 region:rollup2
WAS A LITTLE BIT OF AN

00:33:56.701 --> 00:33:59.538 region:rollup2
AFTERTHOUGHT AND THAT BECAME

00:33:58.036 --> 00:34:01.573 region:rollup2
REALLY CHALLENGING BECAUSE IN

00:33:59.538 --> 00:34:03.775 region:rollup2
THE MOMENT. OF NEED OF

00:34:01.573 --> 00:34:06.912 region:rollup2
EVACUATIONS AYE MEANS WRONG.

00:34:03.775 --> 00:34:07.545 region:rollup2
WHAT WHEN YOU TRANSLATE FOR

00:34:06.912 --> 00:34:08.980 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE?

00:34:07.545 --> 00:34:09.648 region:rollup2
ST THAT'S A PROBLEM BECAUSE

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:11.016 region:rollup2
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO TRANSLATE

00:34:09.648 --> 00:34:12.717 region:rollup2
IT STREET THERE IS NOTHING WHAT

00:34:11.016 --> 00:34:14.352 region:rollup2
THE TRANSLATED NAME AND SO WE

00:34:12.717 --> 00:34:15.854 region:rollup2
REALIZED IT WAS CREATING MORE OF

00:34:14.352 --> 00:34:17.389 region:rollup2
A PROBLEM AND IT'S A SAFETY

00:34:15.854 --> 00:34:19.357 region:rollup2
ISSUE FOR EVERYONE. SO I THINK

00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:20.926 region:rollup2
THAT WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT

00:34:19.357 --> 00:34:23.161 region:rollup2
SAYS YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND

00:34:20.926 --> 00:34:24.863 region:rollup2
TRANSLATE ALL THE INFORMATION IF

00:34:23.161 --> 00:34:26.431 region:rollup2
THERE IS IF THE HIGHEST DOESN'T

00:34:24.863 --> 00:34:27.666 region:rollup2
WORK FOR A COUNTY THEN YOU

00:34:26.431 --> 00:34:29.267 region:rollup2
DUELING WITH YOU. ON THIS WILL

00:34:27.666 --> 00:34:29.935 region:rollup2
BE THE AMENDMENT WE TAKE TO THE

00:34:29.267 --> 00:34:31.369 region:rollup2
NEXT COMMITTEE SHOULD THIS MOVE

00:34:29.935 --> 00:34:33.371 region:rollup2
FORWARD THEN YOU WOULD YOU A

00:34:31.369 --> 00:34:34.339 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE ASSESSMENT AND THAT

00:34:33.371 --> 00:34:36.708 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE ASSESSMENT WOULD

00:34:34.339 --> 00:34:38.944 region:rollup2
CLEARLY PROVIDE THE STEP BY STEP

00:34:36.708 --> 00:34:40.211 region:rollup2
OF WHAT BACK COUNTY NEEDS TO DO.

00:34:38.944 --> 00:34:40.845 region:rollup2
TO RESPOND TO ALL OF THEIR

00:34:40.211 --> 00:34:41.880 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENTS

00:34:40.845 --> 00:34:43.048 region:rollup2

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:45.016 region:rollup2
THERE'S AMENDMENTS THAT YOU'RE

GOING TO BE TAKING OF ARE

00:34:45.016 --> 00:34:47.118 region:rollup2
PRESENTING. AND THAT'S WHAT THE

00:34:46.318 --> 00:34:50.021 region:rollup2
NEXT STEP

00:34:47.118 --> 00:34:50.322 region:rollup2
SO YOU KNOW AS I SAID WHEN I

00:34:50.021 --> 00:34:51.690 region:rollup2
STARTED OUT.

00:34:50.322 --> 00:34:53.658 region:rollup2
.

00:34:51.690 --> 00:34:55.894 region:rollup2
I LIKE WHAT I'M SEEING AND I

00:34:53.658 --> 00:34:57.028 region:rollup2
COULD FEEL IT YOU KNOW THIS BILL

00:34:55.894 --> 00:34:58.129 region:rollup2
IN ANOTHER BILL ARE A COUPLE OF

00:34:57.028 --> 00:34:59.397 region:rollup2
BILLS I HAVE TO.

FROM SO SECURITY FENCING WOULD

00:40:09.474 --> 00:40:13.177 region:rollup2
BE DEFINED AS THE SECURITY DOORS

00:40:11.342 --> 00:40:15.713 region:rollup2
ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE FRONT OF

00:40:13.177 --> 00:40:16.247 region:rollup2
PEOPLE'S HOMES SURE AND THEN

00:40:15.713 --> 00:40:17.749 region:rollup2
ALSO SOME OF THE PERIMETER

00:40:16.247 --> 00:40:19.083 region:rollup2

THIS MAY SEEM A LITTLE BIT OF A

00:40:25.023 --> 00:40:28.493 region:rollup2
PICKY BUT ANY ITEM I BARB WIRE

IT WOULD BE A TRADITIONAL FANS

00:40:29.961 --> 00:40:31.596 region:rollup2
BUT PERHAPS THERE WOULD BE

00:40:30.528 --> 00:40:32.864 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL SECURITY MEASURES ON

00:40:31.596 --> 00:40:34.365 region:rollup2
ON THE PERIMETER. BUT THE

00:40:32.864 --> 00:40:35.300 region:rollup2
PRIMARY WE'RE LOOKING AT IS WHEN

00:40:34.365 --> 00:40:37.302 region:rollup2

OUT WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT AND

00:40:40.371 --> 00:40:43.975 region:rollup2
THEN IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL

00:40:40.939 --> 00:40:44.175 region:rollup2
SECURITY NEEDED LET'S SAY THEY

00:40:43.975 --> 00:40:45.076 region:rollup2

GEOGRAPHIC.

00:41:22.246 --> 00:41:26.250 region:rollup2
SOUTHERN CENTRAL KABUL IN IT BUT

00:41:25.383 --> 00:41:26.784 region:rollup2

00:57:47.397 --> 00:57:50.867 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE THEY HAVE THIS OUT

00:58:05.849 --> 00:58:12.622 region:rollup2
PRACTICES ARE ITSELF

00:58:06.817 --> 00:58:15.359 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTING THE PROBLEM.

00:58:12.622 --> 00:58:16.760 region:rollup2
SURE.

00:58:15.359 --> 00:58:18.495 region:rollup2

THAT OPG IS AVAILABLE TO CONSULT

PUBLIC.

00:58:29.072 --> 00:58:33.343 region:rollup2
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY OPG

00:58:51.628 --> 00:58:54.664 region:rollup2

THERE ANY.

01:06:48.304 --> 01:06:50.506 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS OF WHETHER THIS

01:06:49.205 --> 01:06:53.276 region:rollup2
INCREASED TURN ON THE STATE'S

01:06:50.506 --> 01:06:54.777 region:rollup2
OF THERE IS NO EVIDENCE AT THIS

01:06:53.276 --> 01:06:55.945 region:rollup2
POINT. THAT I HAD BEEN PRESENTED

01:06:54.777 --> 01:06:58.114 region:rollup2
WITH THAT DEMONSTRATES THAT.

01:06:55.945 --> 01:07:00.116 region:rollup2

01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:06.789 region:rollup2
TO ENTRY WHICH IS THAT WHAT ARE

01:07:05.221 --> 01:07:08.091 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT MIGHT

01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:10.526 region:rollup2
EXIST WITH RESPECT TO

01:07:10.526 --> 01:07:13.263 region:rollup2
AND.

01:07:11.427 --> 01:07:14.564 region:rollup2
MUCH OF THAT COULD BE ON A

01:07:13.263 --> 01:07:17.233 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT LIFE ISSUES

01:07:14.564 --> 01:07:18.868 region:rollup2

01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:21.671 region:rollup2

GONNA INCREASE TURN UP AND HERE.

01:07:26.075 --> 01:07:27.277 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S IN THE SPIRIT OF

01:07:26.743 --> 01:07:28.811 region:rollup2
LOWERING THE BARRIERS TO

01:07:27.277 --> 01:07:30.013 region:rollup2

ALWAYS THE NUMBER ONE FACTOR

01:07:42.091 --> 01:07:45.828 region:rollup2
WITH RESPECT TO NON

01:07:44.294 --> 01:07:46.462 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATION OPENS IN A WAY

01:07:45.828 --> 01:07:48.197 region:rollup2
THAT WAS TRUE OF THE FOURTEEN

01:07:46.462 --> 01:07:49.799 region:rollup2
STATES THAT HAVE ALREADY DONE

01:07:48.197 --> 01:07:50.833 region:rollup2
THIS AND IT INCREASE TURNOUT

01:07:49.799 --> 01:07:52.502 region:rollup2
SLIDING CAN INCREASE TURNOUT

01:07:50.833 --> 01:07:57.140 region:rollup2

01:08:05.248 --> 01:08:06.115 region:rollup2
BARRIERS IN THE STATE THAT VOTED

01:08:05.882 --> 01:08:06.983 region:rollup2

01:08:06.115 --> 01:08:09.419 region:rollup2
COULD HAVE BEEN.

01:08:06.983 --> 01:08:10.820 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT SECOND QUESTION

01:08:09.419 --> 01:08:12.589 region:rollup2
HOW DOES JUDGE WHETHER MY FIRST

01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:15.258 region:rollup2
