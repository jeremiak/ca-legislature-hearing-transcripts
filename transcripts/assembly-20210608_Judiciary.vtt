SUGGEST THAT EVEN A DAY LATE

IF SOMETHING IS A DAY LATE BUT

00:41:11.769 --> 00:41:12.937
I DON'T IN ANY WAY WANT TO

00:41:13.003 --> 00:41:16.140

VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER IS

00:45:59.189 --> 00:46:00.858
VITAL TO SURVIVORS. THE

00:46:00.924 --> 00:46:02.092
PROTECTIVE ORDERS REQUIRE THE

00:46:02.159 --> 00:46:04.394
PERPETRATOR TO REFRAIN FROM

INFORMATION OF THE SHARE

00:46:15.005 --> 00:46:16.974

00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:18.242
ALREADY HAS THIS DISCRETION

00:46:18.308 --> 00:46:19.776

GIVEN TO THE PARTIES INVOLVED.

00:46:27.251 --> 00:46:28.986
IT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY STATE

FROM THE PERPETRATOR. THIS

00:46:35.292 --> 00:46:36.326
MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR A SCHOOL

00:46:36.393 --> 00:46:38.262
OR MEDICAL OFFICE TO ENFORCE IF

00:46:38.328 --> 00:46:39.429
THERE'S NO CLEAR LANGUAGE

00:46:39.496 --> 00:46:41.431
STATING OTHERWISE. THEN THESE

00:46:41.498 --> 00:46:42.966
THIRD PARTY INSTITUTIONS WILL

00:46:43.033 --> 00:46:46.270
NOT DENY APPARENT THEIR LEGAL

00:46:47.704 --> 00:46:49.640
YOU KNOW THE WHOLE IDEA OF A

COURT ROOM IS VERY UNIQUE AND

01:27:00.682 --> 01:27:02.116
IN MANY REGARDS AND- FIRST OF

01:27:02.183 --> 01:27:07.155

HEALTH CASES. I HERE IN

01:27:12.327 --> 01:27:14.529
CALIFORNIA. AND IT IS ALSO VERY

01:27:14.596 --> 01:27:16.464
CENTRALIZED IN THE SENSE THAT-

01:27:16.531 --> 01:27:18.099
IT COMBINES A LOT OF THE

01:27:18.166 --> 01:27:20.535
EXPERTISE ALL UNDER ONE ROOF.

01:27:20.602 --> 01:27:23.504
UP SO. NOW THEY HANDLE A LOT OF

01:27:23.571 --> 01:27:25.173
CASES UP OVER THE YEARS I THINK

01:27:25.239 --> 01:27:26.908
THE AVERAGE IS LIKE SIXTY CASES

01:27:26.975 --> 01:27:29.143
A DAY. AND YOU KNOW A LOT MORE

01:27:29.210 --> 01:27:30.845
THAN OTHER COURT ROOMS IN IN

01:27:30.912 --> 01:27:35.249
THE STATE. AND AS A RESULT- DAY

01:27:35.316 --> 01:27:36.651
YOU KNOW I THINK. COMPLYING

01:27:36.718 --> 01:27:39.053
WITH THE TERMS OF THIS LAW.

01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:41.756
WOULD BASICALLY CHANGE THE ON A

01:27:41.823 --> 01:27:43.524
DYNAMIC THE CENTRALIZATION.

01:27:43.591 --> 01:27:44.759
MODELS THAT THEY CURRENTLY

01:27:44.826 --> 01:27:47.028
HOUSE IN THAT THE STATE WOULD

01:27:47.095 --> 01:27:48.796
HAVE TO CONTACT YOU KNOW SEEK A

01:27:48.863 --> 01:27:50.632
SEPARATE COURT ROOM TO HANDLE

01:27:50.698 --> 01:27:51.899
SOME OF THESE CASES THAT THEY

01:27:51.966 --> 01:27:53.134
CURRENTLY HOUSE. WHICH WILL

01:27:53.201 --> 01:27:54.602
BREAK UP THAT CENTRALIZATION

01:27:54.669 --> 01:27:56.804
MODEL A WHICH IS VERY WHICH HAS

01:27:56.871 --> 01:27:58.406
PROVEN TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE.

01:27:58.473 --> 01:27:59.807

CONTINUE NEGOTIATIONS RUSSIA

01:28:17.992 --> 01:28:18.526
AND I THINK THERE'S A WAY TO

01:28:18.593 --> 01:28:21.162
GET THERE AND IF NOT YOU KNOW I

01:28:21.229 --> 01:28:22.563
KNOW THAT THEY SUGGESTED SOME

01:28:22.630 --> 01:28:24.365
AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL AS WELL

01:28:24.432 --> 01:28:26.100
R. IF THOSE MEMBERS DON'T WORK

01:28:26.167 --> 01:28:27.702

COULD DO IS TO PROBABLY.

01:28:31.039 --> 01:28:31.606
IMPLEMENT SOME KIND OF A DELAY

01:28:31.673 --> 01:28:33.808
IMPLEMENTATION POP LANGUAGE IN

01:28:33.875 --> 01:28:35.476

ALLOWED MORE TIME TO CAN

01:28:56.898 --> 01:28:59.167
THERE IS A COURT IN LOS ANGELES

01:28:59.233 --> 01:29:01.335
THAT IS IN OPPOSITION. THE

01:29:01.402 --> 01:29:03.271
PROBLEM IS WE HAVE A CASE OUT

01:29:03.337 --> 01:29:06.240
THERE THE SORENSON CASE. WHICH

01:29:06.307 --> 01:29:08.242

01:29:22.857 --> 01:29:24.692
WOULD ENCOURAGE LOS ANGELES TO

01:29:24.759 --> 01:29:25.793
THINK A LITTLE BIT HARDER ABOUT

01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:27.562
HOW THEY COME INTO COMPLIANCE.

01:29:27.628 --> 01:29:29.363

THAT THERE WAS A CONCERN THAT

THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL COULD

01:42:37.217 --> 01:42:38.752
BE INTERPRETED MEAN THAT

EMPLOYERS- AT THE- COMPARISONS

01:42:49.897 --> 01:42:51.064

BETWEEN EMPLOYEES- AND ORGAN

01:42:55.435 --> 01:42:56.570
SIMPLER FOR ANY DIFFERENCES

01:42:56.637 --> 01:42:57.804
ULTIMATELY COULD ALSO LEAD TO

SOME LEGAL DISPUTES WHICH IS A

01:42:59.373 --> 01:43:00.140
BIG PART OF WHAT SEVERANCE

01:43:00.207 --> 01:43:01.441

01:43:01.508 --> 01:43:03.477
TO POINT OUT THAT ANALYSIS

01:43:03.544 --> 01:43:04.978
THEREFORE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS

SEPARATE AGREEMENTS. HOWEVER

01:43:12.352 --> 01:43:14.054
AND THE ACTUAL LANGUAGE THAT

WILL- WITHIN THE AMENDMENT TO

01:43:15.722 --> 01:43:17.524
SUBSECTION II OF THE RELEVANT-

01:43:17.591 --> 01:43:18.992

AUTHORED SPONSORS DECLINED TO

01:43:28.302 --> 01:43:29.336
ACCEPT THAT AMENDMENT BECAUSE

I AGREE THAT THE CLARIFICATION

01:43:50.591 --> 01:43:51.592
WOULD BE BENEFICIAL AND

VIOLENCE AND CONTROL. THAT

01:48:49.155 --> 01:48:50.724

ALLY ANSWERING BACK TO THE

THERE'S JUST ONE LINE IN THE-

01:58:05.678 --> 01:58:08.881
ANALYSIS THAT I JUST HOPE WE

01:58:08.948 --> 01:58:09.515
CAN BE A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:58:09.582 --> 01:58:11.884
SPECIFIC- THREATENING TO LEAVE

01:58:11.951 --> 01:58:13.886
A PARTNER IF THEY DO NOT BECOME

01:58:13.953 --> 01:58:16.889
PREGNANT CAN BE A BIT BROAD

01:58:16.956 --> 01:58:19.158
BECAUSE I THINK AND- ADULT

01:58:19.225 --> 01:58:20.927
RELATIONSHIPS THE DECISION TO

01:58:20.993 --> 01:58:22.962
HAVE CHILDREN SOMETIMES DOES OR

01:58:23.029 --> 01:58:24.530
NOT HAVE CHILDREN AND COULD

01:58:24.597 --> 01:58:27.066
RESULT IN IN A PARTNER LEAVING

01:58:27.133 --> 01:58:29.101
ANOTHER PARTNER- AND I DON'T

01:58:29.168 --> 01:58:30.536
THINK THAT'S NECESSARILY

01:58:30.603 --> 01:58:32.138
OBVIOUSLY I THINK WE'RE TALKING

01:58:32.205 --> 01:58:33.473
ABOUT AND REASONABLE THREAT

01:58:33.539 --> 01:58:35.408
SIR. YOU KNOW FIRST OF IT JUST

01:58:35.475 --> 01:58:36.876
SEEMS THAT I CAN THAT ONE

01:58:36.943 --> 01:58:37.844
STATEMENT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION

01:58:37.910 --> 01:58:39.912
IS LIKE WITH ANY NOW SYSTEM

01:58:39.979 --> 01:58:42.315
PERMISSION TO RESPOND IT IS NOW

01:58:42.381 --> 01:58:43.683
SAYS ON PAGE SIX AT THE VERY

01:58:43.749 --> 01:58:45.218
BOTTOM AND IS IT IN THE

01:58:45.284 --> 01:58:47.019
LEGISLATIVE LANGUAGE- IT WAS IN

01:58:47.086 --> 01:58:48.287
THE ANALYSIS I DON'T BELIEVE

01:58:48.354 --> 01:58:49.589
IT'S AN LEGISLATIVE I JUST WANT

01:58:49.655 --> 01:58:51.224
TO POINT THAT OUT OF THAT COMES

01:58:51.290 --> 01:58:55.428
IT IT SEEMS A BIT BROAD- TO

01:58:55.495 --> 01:58:57.630
DEFINE. THAT IS COURSE- JUST ON

01:58:57.697 --> 01:58:59.565
ITS FACE IF YOU WELL THE

01:58:59.632 --> 01:59:01.300
STATEMENT ON ITS FACE. THAT'S A

01:59:01.367 --> 01:59:02.635
GOOD POINT I AGREE WITH THAT

01:59:02.702 --> 01:59:04.103
AND I BELIEVE AND I CAN TAKE A

01:59:04.170 --> 01:59:04.971
LOOK AT THIS LEGISLATIVE

01:59:05.037 --> 01:59:07.607
LANGUAGE IN A DETAIL BUT- I.

01:59:07.673 --> 01:59:09.041
THINK THAT'S NOT REFLECTED IN

01:59:09.108 --> 01:59:10.610
THE ACTUAL BILL LANGUAGE WHERE

01:59:10.676 --> 01:59:13.779
THE BILL LANGUAGE DEFINES-

01:59:13.846 --> 01:59:16.015
COMPELLING AS- THE OTHER

01:59:16.082 --> 01:59:17.416
COMPELLING OTHER PARTY BY FORCE

01:59:17.483 --> 01:59:17.850
THREAT OF FORCE OR
