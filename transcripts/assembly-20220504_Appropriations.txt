PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELF I'M FORTY EIGHT. GOOD MORNING I AM MICHELLE MONTARA RUNNERS I AM WITH CONSUMER WATCH JOBS WE STRONGLY SUPPORTS AB TWENTY SIXTEEN ALONG WITH COUNTLESS CALIFORNIA INJURED FAMILY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NO ONE ELSE IS IN QUEUE AT THIS POINT. BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. DR WEBER. GOOD MORNING- SO I WAS WONDERING IF MAYBE AARON BONUS COULD ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT THERE WOULD BE A COST ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF APPEALS DONE BY THE MEDICAL BOARD DECISIONS IF YOU NOW HAVE PEOPLE MAKING DECISIONS ARE THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE MAKING DECISIONS THAT. ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE PROFESSION OUT LET ME JUST ADDRESS IT FIRST AND THEN WE CAN HEAR FROM MR BOND WE ALL SHOULDN'T COMMITTEES WERE WERE NOT EXPERTS BUT WE LISTEN TO STAFF AND THE PEOPLE ON THIS BOARD ARE NOT ONLY COULD LISTEN TO THE STAFF OF THE MEDICAL BOARD BUT THEY WILL LISTEN TO THE DOCTORS. AND SO. I SINCERELY DOUBT THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE MORE APPEALS BECAUSE OF THIS BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE US WILL LISTEN TO THE EXPERTS. OUR GO AHEAD MR ABOUT. THANK YOU- WEBER FOR THE QUESTION- FIRST OF ALL I WOULD RESPOND BY SAYING THAT THE BOARD PROVIDES A TRAINING TO ALL THOSE BOARD MEMBERS TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND THE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS ITS PURPOSE THE RELEVANT STANDARD OF CARE IN ANY GIVEN CASE AND OTHER ITEMS THAT ARE RELATED TO THE BOARD'S INVESTIGATION. THE BOARD- MEMBERS DO RELY UPON AS WELL MEDICAL EXPERTS WHO REVIEW ALL OF THE EVIDENCE AND RENDER AN OPINION ON WHERE IT IS OUR IN THIS YEAR AND CERTAINLY AS WELL WOULD- BE ABLE TO ENJOY THE INPUT FROM THE POSITION MEMBERS ON- WHO ARE ALSO ON THE BOARD AND SIT ON THESE PANELS I'D ALSO STATE THAT THE BILL TAKES A VERY MODEST APPROACH WE THINK TO CHANGING THE COMPOSITION SIMPLY REPLACING ONE PHYSICIAN MEMBER WITH A PUBLIC MEMBER SO- I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE ANY SIGNIFICANT DIMINISHMENT IN THE BOYS AN INPUT. THAT POSITION MEMBERS WOULD HAVE THERE CERTAINLY ARE A ARE AND CONTINUE TO BE A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE BOARDS- THE DECISION MAKING AND THEN IN AN ADDITIONALLY I LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE BOARD CASES ARE RESOLVED THROUGH A STIPULATION SETTLEMENT. I THAT WAS 80% OF OUR CASES WERE RESOLVED AND THROUGH A STIPULATED SETTLEMENT IN THE FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY. AND WHEN THAT OCCURS THE PHYSICIAN TO ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE BOARD THEY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT. TO A JUDICIAL APPEAL WHICH WOULD OBVIATE ANY OF THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE OPPOSITION'S COMMENTS. AND THEN I THINK JUST IN CLOSING I WOULD SAY WE'VE NOT SEEN ANY EVIDENCE FROM THE OPPOSITION TO SUBSTANTIATE- THEIR CLAIM THAT THEY WOULD BE. MORE COST ASSOCIATED IN THE MANNER THAT THEY DESCRIBE- SO- WITH THAT I WOULD DISAGREE WITH THOSE COMMENTS FROM THE OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR- FOR ANSWERING THOSE QUESTIONS I- I THINK THERE IS A DIFFERENCE WHEN YOU ARE JUDGED BY MAJORITY OF YOUR PEERS- THAT YOU'D BE LESS LIKELY TO APPEAL THEN IF YOU'RE JUDGED BY PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT NECESSARILY IN YOUR PROFESSION- WE HAD A ROBUST DISCUSS. IN ABOUT THIS AND BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS AND THAT OF. THE SHARE OF THE MEDICAL BOARD WAS THERE. NOW WE WENT THROUGH THE FACT THAT SEVENTEEN OF TWENTY OF THE CURRENT HEALING ARTS BOARDS HAVE LICENSED PROFESSIONALS AS THE MAJORITY. THE FACT THAT THE BOARD TO DO MORE THAN JUST IF THE PLAN- WHICH IS WHY IT'S REALLY AN IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND. THE PROFESSION AND ALL OF THE COMPLEXITY THEY ALSO OVERSEE APPROVAL OF THE UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS ARE CLINICAL HOSPITAL CLERKSHIPS. ARAD ARE CONTINUING MEDICAL EDUCATION FOR PHYSICIANS AND SO IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT YOU HAVE- PEOPLE ON THE BOARD THE MAJORITY THE PEOPLE ON THE BOARD THAT ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND. BUT I THINK FOR ME WHAT WAS MOST CONCERNING- AND YOU KIND OF. ALLUDED TO IT. TODAY IS THAT THIS BILL ISN'T GOING TO. CHANGE THE OUTCOME. IT'S NOT GOING TO- BECAUSE THERE TO BE ANY ANY DIFFERENCE AND WHAT THE PUBLIC HAS BEEN REQUESTING- THE FACT THAT THIS BILL IS JUST TO KIND OF RESTORE PUBLIC TRUST BUT YOU'RE STILL GOING TO. YIELD AND LISTEN TO AS YOU SAY THE EXPERTS- IS CAN IS REALLY CONCERNING FOR ME LIKE WE'RE NOT IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE JUST TRYING TO PACIFY PEOPLE INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING. WHEN I ASKED THE- THE CHAIR OF THE BOARD SHE COULD LET ME KNOW. WHEN HOW MANY OF THE VOTES FOR ONE OFF SHE SHE COULDN'T BECAUSE IT'S- CLEARLY NOT SOMETHING THAT'S DONE ON A REGULAR BASIS OR MAYBE EVEN NOT AT ALL. AND SO I ABSTAINED BEFORE WILL BE OPPOSING TODAY I DO THINK THERE ARE SOME FINANCIAL COST THAT WE REALLY HAVEN'T KIND OF DWELLED INTO. BUT I THINK THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO RESTORE PUBLIC TRUST WE DON'T DO THAT BY REMOVING THOSE THAT CAN BEST ADVOCATE FOR PATIENTS BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE PROFESSION. BUT WE DO IT BY ACTUALLY REMOVED. IT SHOULD BE PRACTICING IT. WE DO IT BY CUTTING DOWN ON A TIME FRAME BUT I DO APPRECIATE I'M BAFFERT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. ADDUCTOR WORK THIS BILL IS OUT ON A B.

NO COMMENTS WE WOULD THIS BILL IS OUTWITH REPUBLICANS NOT VOTING DAVIES I. MISSISSIPPI ARE TO. SB SEVENTEEN ELEVEN RESIDUE PASS. THE MOVE TO THEIR SECOND. THANK YOU ON A WHEELCHAIR- AB HERE TO PRESENT AB SEVENTEEN ELEVEN AB SEVENTEEN ELEVEN IS A SIMPLE CLARIFICATION BILL WHEN IT COMES TO PUBLIC NOTIFICATIONS OF DATA BREACHES IN GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS. WHILE THE LAW IS CLEAR IN SITUATIONS WHERE ONLY ONE PARTY IS IN CONTROL OF THE SYSTEM LIKE A GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT OR A PRIVATE BUSINESS. THE CURRENT LAWS VAGUE WHEN COMPANIES WORKING WITH GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS SUFFER A DATA BREACH IN THESE INSTANCES THE LAW TREATS THESE DATA BREACHES LIKE PRIVATE BUSINESS BRIDGES WITHOUT ANY CONNECTION TO THE GOVERNMENT SYSTEM. THIS METHOD OF REPORTING DOES NOT INFORM THE PUBLIC THAT THEIR INFORMATION WAS HANDLED BY A THIRD PARTY. IN A TIME WHEN PHISHING SCAMS AND FAKE NOTIFICATIONS ARE PREVAILING IT IS IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE REFERENCES FOR THE PUBLIC TO DOUBLE CHECK NOTICES TO ENSURE AUTHENTICITY. IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE CONSIDERING THAT THESE NOTIFICATIONS MAY COME FROM A COMPANY THAT IS A THIRD PARTY CONTRACTOR AND THE INDIVIDUAL HAS NEVER EVEN HEARD. THERE HAD ANY INTERACTION WITH THAT COMPANY. AB SEVENTEEN ELEVEN ALSO REQUIRE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES TO REPORT DATA BREACHES OF ENTITIES WHO ARE WORKING ON OR WITH GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS IN ADDITION TO REPORTS POSTED BY WITH OUR BY THOSE ENTITIES. THIS WILL PROVIDE THE PUBLIC WITH A MORE INFORMED UNDERSTANDING CLARITY OF HOW THEIR INFORMATION IS HANDLED AND ALLOW THEM TO RESPOND ACCORDINGLY.
