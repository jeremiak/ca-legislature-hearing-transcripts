THE L. A. AS TABLE HERE WE SEE

00:54:57.627 --> 00:55:00.063
FROM THE JANUARY PROPOSAL TO THE

00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:03.733
MAY PROPOSAL AN ON GOING FUNDING

00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:05.702
WE ACTUALLY GO DOWN BY SIXTY

00:55:05.769 --> 00:55:09.205
MILLION DOLLARS. THAT CORRECT.

00:55:09.272 --> 00:55:11.007
THAT IS CORRECT OKAY THAT

00:55:11.074 --> 00:55:13.009

RETIREE HEALTH BENEFITS SUCH AS

00:55:21.217 --> 00:55:23.186
BUT I GUESS THE BIG PICTURE IS.

00:55:23.253 --> 00:55:25.522
FROM THE JANUARY BUDGET THERE'S

00:55:25.588 --> 00:55:26.990
FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN

00:55:27.057 --> 00:55:29.392

VERSION THERE'S FOUR HUNDRED AND

00:55:35.231 --> 00:55:35.865
SEVEN THAT'S A DIFFERENCE

00:55:35.932 --> 00:55:37.801

DIFFERENCE OF MINUS SIXTY

00:55:39.169 --> 00:55:41.271
MILLION DOLLARS IN JANUARY. SO

00:55:41.337 --> 00:55:42.572
TWO THINGS HAVE HAPPENED SINCE

00:55:42.639 --> 00:55:45.175
JANUARY ONE THE CSU IT TALKED

00:55:45.241 --> 00:55:48.178
ABOUT THEIR NEEDS TO MAKE CALL.

00:55:48.244 --> 00:55:50.814
THEIR AGREEMENTS WITH THEIR

00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:53.149

EMPLOYEES THAT I'M SURE WILL

00:56:02.525 --> 00:56:06.129
SPEAK ABOUT. SO I NEED FROM CSU

00:56:06.196 --> 00:56:09.199

WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE CSU

00:57:56.472 --> 00:57:59.609
AND ITS LABOR PARTNERS ARE

00:57:59.676 --> 00:58:00.143
RESPONSIBLE FOR COLLECTIVE

00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:03.046
BARGAINING. HE DOES DO YOU DOES

00:58:03.112 --> 00:58:04.881
THE ADMINISTRATION THINK THAT

00:58:04.948 --> 00:58:08.551
THE SYSTEM- NEEDS MORE ONGOING

00:58:08.618 --> 00:58:09.786

WITH FINANCE AGAIN- THE

00:58:19.195 --> 00:58:21.164
ADMINISTRATION IS REAFFIRMING

00:58:21.231 --> 00:58:23.366
THE MULTI YEAR CONTACTED GREED

00:58:23.433 --> 00:58:24.067
TO WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE

00:58:24.133 --> 00:58:25.935
UNIVERSITY PROPOSING GOVERNOR'S

PREDICTABILITY AND THE

00:58:29.305 --> 00:58:30.907
FLEXIBILITY ASSOCIATED WITH

00:58:30.974 --> 00:58:32.442
THOSE CONTACTS ARE SUFFICIENT TO

00:58:32.508 --> 00:58:34.344
MAINTAIN UNIVERSITY OPERATIONS.

00:58:34.410 --> 00:58:35.912
I KNOW I ASK A QUESTION YOUR

00:58:35.979 --> 00:58:37.447
ANSWERS LIKE A PRE PROGRAMMED

00:58:37.513 --> 00:58:39.282
ANSWER OVER HERE I GET THAT

00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:41.384
THAT'S YOUR JOB BUT DO YOU THINK

00:58:41.451 --> 00:58:44.354
THAT THE CSU NEEDS. MORE MONEY

00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:46.923
TO ADDRESS THEIR AGREEMENTS WITH

00:58:46.990 --> 00:58:49.959
THE UNIONS. YES SIR NOW. THE

00:58:50.026 --> 00:58:51.394
ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO-

00:58:51.461 --> 00:58:52.395
FROM THE MULTI YEARCONTACT A

00:58:52.462 --> 00:58:53.630
GREEDY WHEN THE GOVERNOR'S

00:58:53.696 --> 00:58:56.332
BUDGET OKAY AND THEN AS FAR AS

00:58:56.399 --> 00:58:58.835
THE- THE CAPITAL PROJECTS I KNOW

00:58:58.902 --> 00:59:00.670
THAT YOU KNOW SOME OF THESE

00:59:00.737 --> 00:59:02.772
CAPITAL PROJECTS. WITH ONE TIME

00:59:02.839 --> 00:59:05.408
MONEY ARE- A GOOD USE OF ONE

00:59:05.475 --> 00:59:07.510
TIME MONEY AND THAT IS AN AREA

00:59:07.577 --> 00:59:09.812
THAT THERE WAS AN INCREASE FROM

00:59:09.879 --> 00:59:11.147
THE JANUARY BUDGET TO THE MAY

00:59:11.214 --> 00:59:13.950
BUDGET A LITTLE OVER ONE HUNDRED

00:59:14.017 --> 00:59:15.885
AND SEVENTY FOUR MILLION I

00:59:15.952 --> 00:59:18.087
GUESS- THERE'S TWO PROJECTS THAT

00:59:18.154 --> 00:59:20.123
THEY'RE HERE. THAT THAT JUMPED

00:59:20.189 --> 00:59:21.958
OUT OF THE LION'S SHARE OF IT

00:59:22.025 --> 00:59:23.626
ARE FOR THE SAN DIEGO STATE

00:59:23.693 --> 00:59:26.863
FRAWLEY CENTER AND FULLER TEN-

00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:28.698
YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN TO FULLER TEN

00:59:28.765 --> 00:59:31.534
I'VE IS THERE RECENTLY AND

00:59:31.601 --> 00:59:33.403
THAT'S I THINK THAT. THE IF NOT

00:59:33.469 --> 00:59:35.505
THE LARGEST THE TOP TWO OR THREE

00:59:35.571 --> 00:59:37.373
LARGEST THE ISSUES AND HAS A

00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:41.411
HUGE ENROLLMENT- DEMANDS AND SO

00:59:41.477 --> 00:59:43.212
THEY'VE CLEARLY NEED MORE. YOU

00:59:43.279 --> 00:59:46.282
KNOW- LAB SPACE COMPUTER SCIENCE

00:59:46.349 --> 00:59:50.119
SPACE AND HOUSING- SO I WOULD

00:59:50.186 --> 00:59:52.021
THINK THAT THAT PROJECT WOULD BE

00:59:52.088 --> 00:59:56.492
ABLE TO HELP WITH- ENROLLING

00:59:56.559 --> 00:59:58.661
MORE STUDENTS OF THE CSU. BUT I

00:59:58.728 --> 00:59:59.829
GUESS THE QUESTION ARE ARE THESE

00:59:59.896 --> 01:00:03.333
TWO- SYSTEMS ARE USED TO ARE

01:00:03.399 --> 01:00:06.469
PROJECTS WOULD THEY BE ON THE

01:00:06.536 --> 01:00:08.671
LIST FOR CSU FOR THE HIGHEST

01:00:08.738 --> 01:00:10.707
NEED TO EXPAND ACCESS

01:00:10.773 --> 01:00:14.644
CALIFORNIANS AND CAL. IN THE CSU

01:00:14.711 --> 01:00:16.379
. WELL CERTAINLY FOR THE FULLER

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:18.881
TEN PROJECT- I THINK IT GOES

01:00:18.948 --> 01:00:19.882
BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE

01:00:19.949 --> 01:00:20.984
NORTHRIDGE CAMPUS OF FULLERTON

01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:22.318
WORK WHO HAS THE MOST STUDENTS

01:00:22.385 --> 01:00:24.220
IN FULLERTON AS- POTENTIALLY

01:00:24.287 --> 01:00:25.221
NUMBER WANTED NATURE MIGHT BE

01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:27.757
NUMBER TWO BUT CERTAINLY AT A

01:00:27.824 --> 01:00:28.992
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF STUDENTS

01:00:29.058 --> 01:00:30.426
IN ORANGE COUNTY. I THINK ONE

01:00:30.493 --> 01:00:32.061
THING THAT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE

01:00:32.128 --> 01:00:33.496
ABOUT THE FULLER TO PROJECT IS

01:00:33.563 --> 01:00:35.031
THAT THIS WOULD BE AN EXPANSION

01:00:35.098 --> 01:00:38.368
OF A BUILDING THAT- FIRST- WAS

01:00:38.434 --> 01:00:39.902
BUILT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE

01:00:39.969 --> 01:00:41.571
AND HASN'T HAD ANY SIGNIFICANT

01:00:41.637 --> 01:00:43.906
RENOVATIONS OR IMPROVEMENTS. AND

01:00:43.973 --> 01:00:45.208
FULLERTON HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN

01:00:45.274 --> 01:00:47.043
THE LARGEST CAMPUS IN THE C.

01:00:47.110 --> 01:00:48.111
ISSUE IT IS GROWN DRAMATICALLY

01:00:48.177 --> 01:00:49.679
IN ITS THE ONLY CAMPUS SERVING

01:00:49.746 --> 01:00:51.581
GENERALLY ORANGE COUNTY. SO

01:00:51.647 --> 01:00:53.383
THERE IS A LOT OF MERIT THERE-

01:00:53.449 --> 01:00:55.151
ONE THING ALSO WITH THAT PROJECT

01:00:55.218 --> 01:00:56.986
IS THAT IS. WHAT THE

01:00:57.053 --> 01:00:58.421
ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING IS

01:00:58.488 --> 01:00:59.756
TO ADVANCE THE WORK ON THIS

01:00:59.822 --> 01:01:02.358
PROJECT BY ONE YEAR IS HONOR

01:01:02.425 --> 01:01:03.159
TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR YEAR A

01:01:03.226 --> 01:01:06.929
CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS- PLAN-

01:01:06.996 --> 01:01:08.664
THE MISTRESSES IS CHOOSING TO

01:01:08.731 --> 01:01:09.732
AFFORD ADVANCE AND WORK ON THAT

01:01:09.799 --> 01:01:11.401
PROJECT. RIGHT AWAY VERSUS

01:01:11.467 --> 01:01:13.236
WAITING A YEAR SELL MAKES A LOT

01:01:13.302 --> 01:01:15.171
OF SENSE FROM THAT VANTAGE

01:01:15.238 --> 01:01:17.907
POINT. SO AS FAR AS THE BRAWLEY

01:01:17.974 --> 01:01:20.810
ONE. IF IS THAT. IF YOU AN

01:01:20.877 --> 01:01:24.680
ADDITIONAL WHAT IS THE BY ONE

01:01:24.747 --> 01:01:25.681
EIGHTY NINE SIXTY SIXTY EIGHT

01:01:25.748 --> 01:01:27.150
MILLION SO IT IS THIS THE

01:01:27.216 --> 01:01:28.818
HIGHEST AND BEST USE FOR STATE

01:01:28.885 --> 01:01:30.686
MONEY TO EXPAND ACCESS FOR CS

01:01:30.753 --> 01:01:31.854
WELL I'D SAY IT'S ONE OF THE

01:01:31.921 --> 01:01:33.890
HIGHEST PARTIES OF THE SAN DIEGO

01:01:33.956 --> 01:01:35.258
STATE CAMPUS IT IS NOT CURRENTLY

01:01:35.324 --> 01:01:36.926
ON THE MULTI YEAR PLAN FOR THE

01:01:36.993 --> 01:01:38.394
SAN DIEGO STATE CAMPUS- THERE

01:01:38.461 --> 01:01:40.296
ARE SOME BENEFITS TO THE PROJECT

01:01:40.363 --> 01:01:42.298
OBVIOUSLY BEING VERY CLOSE TO

01:01:42.365 --> 01:01:44.400
LITHIUM PRODUCTION AREA. AS WELL

01:01:44.467 --> 01:01:46.436
AS REALLY A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL

01:01:46.502 --> 01:01:48.237
STEM RELATED DEGREES OUT IN THE

01:01:48.304 --> 01:01:49.939
IMPERIAL VALLEY MOST OF THE

01:01:50.006 --> 01:01:51.741
COURSE OFFERINGS AT BRAWLING ARE

01:01:51.808 --> 01:01:53.876
RELATED TO BACHELORS OF ARTS AND

01:01:53.943 --> 01:01:55.845
TEACHER CREDENTIALING DEGREES-

01:01:55.912 --> 01:01:57.613
AND THAT WOULD BE A OF A PROJECT

01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:58.681
THAT COULD POTENTIALLY EXPAND

01:01:58.748 --> 01:02:01.050
INTO THE SCIENCES AND OTHER STEM

01:02:01.117 --> 01:02:04.687
FIELDS SO THAT THAT COULD BE.

01:02:04.754 --> 01:02:06.222
BENEFICIAL TO THE STATE OF

01:02:06.289 --> 01:02:07.390
CALIFORNIA TO. YEAH THIS ONE IS-

01:02:07.457 --> 01:02:09.158
ONE THAT WE HAD NOT SEEN ON ON

01:02:09.225 --> 01:02:13.930
YOUR CSU LAST- NOR HAD WE- HAVE

01:02:13.996 --> 01:02:16.165
WE SEEN THIS FOR MEMBERS WHO WHO

01:02:16.232 --> 01:02:17.934
ARE BEEN PUTTING IN REQUESTS FOR

01:02:25.374 --> 01:02:27.510
PLASTI VALUE IT THIS. SO I KNOW

FOCUS SEEN NEW ON GOING FUNDS ON

01:09:35.504 --> 01:09:37.306
APPORTIONMENT INCREASES BOTH THE

01:09:37.373 --> 01:09:39.475
COST OF LIVING. ADJUSTMENTS THE

01:09:39.542 --> 01:09:41.944

THE MAY REVISION. OKOLO WILL

01:09:46.048 --> 01:09:47.950
HELP DISTRICTS AND EMPLOYEES

01:09:48.017 --> 01:09:50.386
ADDRESS. OF RISING COST

01:09:50.452 --> 01:09:52.021
PRESSURES AND THEN ADDING

01:09:52.087 --> 01:09:55.124
FURTHER BASE MONEY TO

01:09:55.190 --> 01:09:56.425
APPORTIONMENT SOON AS THE

01:09:56.492 --> 01:09:58.160
STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA

01:09:58.227 --> 01:10:00.729
ALSO WOULD HELP COLLEGES ADDRESS

01:10:00.796 --> 01:10:02.998
RISING COSTS BUT ALSO WOULD HAVE

01:10:03.065 --> 01:10:04.633
THE EFFECT OF FUNDING MORE

01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:06.402
DISTRICTS BASED ON THE FORMULA.

01:10:06.468 --> 01:10:09.838
RATHER THAN FUNNY THEM BASED ON

01:10:09.905 --> 01:10:11.106
THE HOLD HARMLESS PROVISIONS. WE

01:10:11.173 --> 01:10:13.208
THINK THAT WOULD BE A GOOD THING

01:10:13.275 --> 01:10:13.709
IT WOULD CREATE BETTER

01:10:13.776 --> 01:10:15.411
INENTIVES FOR DISTRICTS TO

01:10:15.477 --> 01:10:17.813
SERVE STUDENTS BETTER. THAT WE

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:19.848
THINK PROVIDING BASING CREASES

01:10:19.915 --> 01:10:21.417
IS REASONABLE THE LEGISLATURE

01:10:21.483 --> 01:10:23.052
COULD CHOOSE A DIFFERENT AMOUNT

01:10:23.118 --> 01:10:24.153
OF COURSE AND WHAT THE

01:10:24.219 --> 01:10:25.788
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING OR DECIDE

01:10:25.854 --> 01:10:27.289
ON IS DIFFERENT SPLIT BETWEEN

01:10:27.356 --> 01:10:28.891
THE BASIC ALLOCATION THAT MISTER

01:10:28.958 --> 01:10:33.596
HANOVER MENTION. AND RATE-INCREASES AND YOU CAN MAKE THAT

01:10:33.662 --> 01:10:34.597
DECISION BASED ON LEGISLATIVE

01:10:34.663 --> 01:10:36.465
PRIORITIES. THE MAY REVISION

01:10:36.532 --> 01:10:39.501
FOCUSES ONE TIME FUNDS ON TWO

01:10:39.568 --> 01:10:41.203
MAJOR PURPOSES YOU COULD SEE

01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:43.205
THAT ON THE PAGE THREE UNDER ONE

01:10:43.272 --> 01:10:45.474
TIME INITIATIVES YOU SEE THE TOP

01:10:45.541 --> 01:10:47.343
TWO ROWS THERE. SO THERE'S

01:10:47.409 --> 01:10:49.311
FUNDING FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

01:10:49.378 --> 01:10:51.547
AND A DISCRETIONARY BLOCK GRANT

01:10:51.614 --> 01:10:54.183
THAT WOULD ALLOW COLLEGES TO.

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:56.952
USE THE FUNDS TO ADDRESS LOCAL

01:10:57.019 --> 01:10:58.354
NEEDS. ALTHOUGH WE FIND MERIT

01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:01.657

AMOUNTS DEPENDING ON OVERALL

OF THEIR PRIMARY OBSTACLES TO

SPECIFICALLY TALKING ABOUT THE

01:17:59.374 --> 01:18:01.176
ON GOING MONEY. IT JUST DOESN'T

01:18:01.243 --> 01:18:04.613
SEEM TO EVEN KEEP THEM UP WITH

01:18:04.679 --> 01:18:06.782
LAST YEAR- DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT

01:18:06.848 --> 01:18:08.884
ON THAT IN OTHER WORDS WHAT I'M

01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:10.085
SAYING IS. THEIR COSTS ARE GOING

01:18:10.152 --> 01:18:12.621
UP FASTER. THAN THEN THE

01:18:12.687 --> 01:18:16.892
INCREASE IN IN IN IN THE BUDGET.

01:18:16.958 --> 01:18:18.994
AS AS AS I SEE IT RIGHT HERE THE

01:18:19.061 --> 01:18:21.263
PROPOSED- THE MAY REVISE. DO DO

01:18:21.329 --> 01:18:23.932
YOU HAVE A COMMENT ON THAT-

01:18:23.999 --> 01:18:28.637
DANDARA BERMAN A FINANCE- SO I

01:18:28.703 --> 01:18:31.006
THINK TO ADDRESS YOU'RE GOING TO

01:18:31.073 --> 01:18:32.174
I THINK THE MEASURES AND STUFF

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:33.108
AND WHETHER THERE ARE

01:18:33.175 --> 01:18:34.142
SIGNIFICANT COST PRESSURES BEING

01:18:34.209 --> 01:18:36.645
FACED BY DISTRICTS- AND I THINK

01:18:36.711 --> 01:18:38.814
TO THAT NO WE KNOW THAT THAT THE

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:40.315
MAY REVISION DOES REFLECT STRONG

01:18:40.382 --> 01:18:41.249
USE OF ONGOING RESOURCES

01:18:41.316 --> 01:18:42.184
AVAILABLE UNDERNEATH THE

01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:43.318
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

01:18:43.385 --> 01:18:44.586
GUARANTEE. TO TRY TO HELP

01:18:44.653 --> 01:18:45.887
DISTRICTS WITH THIS WHETHER IT'S

01:18:45.954 --> 01:18:49.458
THE SIX POINT 56% COLA INCREASE

01:18:49.524 --> 01:18:51.159
THE THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE

01:18:51.226 --> 01:18:52.194
MILLION ONGOING FOR BASING

01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:53.428
CREASES AND THE SEVEN HUNDRED

01:18:53.495 --> 01:18:55.330
AND FIFTY MILLION WHICH WILL BE

01:18:55.397 --> 01:18:56.598
A ONE TIME DOES PROVIDE A ONE

01:18:56.665 --> 01:18:59.101
TIME IT DOES PROVIDE A FLEXIBLE

01:18:59.167 --> 01:19:00.202
USE OF FINDINGS THAT THEY CAN

01:19:00.268 --> 01:19:01.770
HELP DISTRICTS REDUCE THEIR LONG

01:19:01.837 --> 01:19:04.039
TERM OBLIGATIONS SO. AND AGAIN

01:19:04.106 --> 01:19:04.973
THE FUNDING IS AVAILABLE OVER

01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:07.309
MULTIPLE YEARS SO THEN I THINK

01:19:07.375 --> 01:19:08.043
THIS BUDGET DOES REPRESENT A

01:19:08.110 --> 01:19:10.512
STRONG NEW INFLUX OF RESOURCES

01:19:10.579 --> 01:19:12.681
TO THE PROPER TO THE TO

01:19:12.747 --> 01:19:14.382
COMMUNICATE SYSTEM AND AGAIN-

01:19:14.449 --> 01:19:16.151
REFLECTS A PRUDENT USE OF

01:19:16.218 --> 01:19:18.286
ONGOING ONE TIME FUNDING-

01:19:18.353 --> 01:19:19.154
UNDERNEATH THE PROPOSITION

01:19:19.221 --> 01:19:20.422
NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE WAS A

01:19:20.489 --> 01:19:22.424
DECENT START I'VE JUST FROM MY

01:19:22.491 --> 01:19:23.191
PERSPECTIVE NOT NECESSARILY A

01:19:23.258 --> 01:19:24.793
GOOD FINISH BUT I HOPE WE CAN

01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:26.761
GET A GOOD FINISH AS WELL. AS

01:19:26.828 --> 01:19:28.830
THE PROCESS MOVES FOR BUT I JUST

01:19:28.897 --> 01:19:29.998
HOPE PEOPLE ON THIS COMMITTEE

01:19:30.065 --> 01:19:31.933
EVEN PAY ATTENTION TO THE FACT

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.668
THAT WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE IS

01:19:33.735 --> 01:19:35.103
COSTS ARE GOING UP OR GOING UP

01:19:35.170 --> 01:19:35.971
AND THEN WE HEAR- HISTORIC

01:19:36.037 --> 01:19:38.373
DOLLARS WELL HISTORIC ADDITION

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:39.975
DURING HISTORIC INFLATION AND

01:19:40.041 --> 01:19:41.610
STORK OTHER COST PRESSURES

01:19:41.676 --> 01:19:43.879
DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN. THAT A

01:19:43.945 --> 01:19:46.047
SCHOOL IS- THE COMMITTEE COLLEGE

01:19:46.114 --> 01:19:48.683
SYSTEM IS GETTING MORE MONEY AND

01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:50.318
JUST ANOTHER QUESTION PROBABLY

01:19:50.385 --> 01:19:51.686
FOR THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE I

01:19:51.753 --> 01:19:54.689
BELIEVE IT'S SEVENTEEN NEW

01:19:54.756 --> 01:19:56.491
POSITIONS TO THE CHANCELLOR'S

01:19:56.558 --> 01:19:57.859
OFFICE COULD YOU MAYBE WALK ME

01:19:57.926 --> 01:20:00.395
THROUGH I THAT WOULD BE. YEAH A

01:20:00.462 --> 01:20:02.297
LOT MORNING ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:20:02.364 --> 01:20:04.366
O'DONNELL- IN MANY WAYS THE

01:20:04.432 --> 01:20:06.868
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE OPEN NOW WE

01:20:06.935 --> 01:20:09.404
ARE WORKING WE WORK UNDER THE

01:20:09.471 --> 01:20:12.207
CAL H. R. MODEL WHICH HAS US

01:20:12.274 --> 01:20:14.209
THAT THREE DAYS AS A TELEWORK

01:20:14.276 --> 01:20:15.777
AGREEMENT A JUST A PIRATE I JUST

01:20:15.844 --> 01:20:17.179
THINK THAT'S CRAZY SHOULD BE IN

01:20:17.245 --> 01:20:18.813
THAT BUILDING WORKING TO SERVE

01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:20.248
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM

01:20:20.315 --> 01:20:21.883
CLASSROOMS ARE OPEN THE

01:20:21.950 --> 01:20:23.151
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE SHOULD BE

01:20:23.218 --> 01:20:28.623
OPEN AS IS. THIS COMMITTEE BUT

01:20:28.690 --> 01:20:30.292
THAT'S MY OPINION THAT Q. GOING

01:20:30.358 --> 01:20:31.693
. THERE THERE IS CHANCES ARE.

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:32.794
SAM AND THEIR TWENTY TWO TO

01:20:32.861 --> 01:20:34.462
THREE BY RIP. ACT REQUESTED

01:20:34.529 --> 01:20:36.431
THIRTY ONE POSITIONS. AND SO THE

01:20:36.498 --> 01:20:37.732
TWENTY SIX THAT YOU SEE HERE

01:20:37.799 --> 01:20:40.235
REALLY ARE ALIGNED- WITH NEW

01:20:40.302 --> 01:20:42.103
PROGRAMS AND COMMITMENTS

01:20:42.170 --> 01:20:44.706
DELIVERABLES. THAT HAVE BEEN

01:20:44.773 --> 01:20:47.142
ADDED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS.

01:20:47.209 --> 01:20:49.811
AND SO THESE POSITIONS- WOULD

01:20:49.878 --> 01:20:53.081
SPECIALIZE IN- VARIOUS-

01:20:53.148 --> 01:20:54.983
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES

01:20:55.050 --> 01:20:57.619
INCLUDING TRANSFER REFORM-

01:20:57.686 --> 01:21:00.088
INCLUDING FOCUSING ON SOME OF

01:21:00.155 --> 01:21:01.890
THE- PROGRAMS THAT SERVE.

01:21:01.957 --> 01:21:03.892
UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS SINCE

01:21:03.959 --> 01:21:05.827
AND STUDENTS THAT. ARE IN

01:21:05.894 --> 01:21:06.661
PROGRAMS THAT SERVE

01:21:06.728 --> 01:21:08.430
UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS

INCLUDING- RISING SCHOLARS

01:21:11.099 --> 01:21:13.068
MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS- THE

01:21:13.134 --> 01:21:15.470
IMPLEMENTATION OF OVERALL BASIC

01:21:15.537 --> 01:21:17.005
NEEDS STRATEGIES ACROSS OUR

01:21:17.072 --> 01:21:19.741
CAMPUSES. THERE'S ALSO A FOCUS

01:21:19.808 --> 01:21:21.876
ON BACCALAUREATE DEGREES WHICH

01:21:21.943 --> 01:21:24.613
IS- OF. SOME BEGAN AS A LEAD

01:21:24.679 --> 01:21:27.048
FROM AN ASSEMBLY BILL- THAT

01:21:27.115 --> 01:21:28.917
REQUIRES AN EXTENSIVE REVIEW

01:21:28.984 --> 01:21:31.086
PROCESS IN COLLABORATION WITH.

01:21:31.152 --> 01:21:34.089
OUR FOR YOUR PARTNERS AND SO-

01:21:34.155 --> 01:21:35.490
MANY OF THESE POSITIONS AND

01:21:35.557 --> 01:21:37.726
HAPPY TO WALK THROUGH IN MORE

01:21:37.792 --> 01:21:41.229
DETAIL- UP WITH A WHAT THESE

01:21:41.296 --> 01:21:45.033
WOULD TO. OVERALL AS AN AGENCY

01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:48.236
WE REPORT ON AN AVERAGE OF OVER

01:21:48.303 --> 01:21:49.337
TWO HUNDRED HOURS WEEKLY

01:21:49.404 --> 01:21:51.072
OVERTIME. AND SO WHAT WE'RE

01:21:51.139 --> 01:21:53.074
TRYING TO DO IS REALLY REDUCE

01:21:53.141 --> 01:21:55.977
THAT- AGAIN BECAUSE IN SINCE

01:21:56.044 --> 01:21:57.812
TWENTY FOURTEEN WE'VE SEEN- AN

01:21:57.879 --> 01:21:59.381
INCREASE FROM FIFTY NINE

01:21:59.447 --> 01:22:00.949
PROGRAMS THAT WE ADMINISTER TO

01:22:01.016 --> 01:22:02.984
A- HUNDRED AND NINE. AND SO

01:22:03.051 --> 01:22:05.053
WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO KEEP PACE

01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:07.389
WITH THE NEW ADDED WORKLOAD- AND

01:22:07.455 --> 01:22:08.290
THESE POSITIONS WOULD HELP DO

01:22:08.356 --> 01:22:09.858
THAT. OKAY THANK YOU I

01:22:09.924 --> 01:22:11.626
APPRECIATE THAT PERSPECTIVE BUT-

01:22:11.693 --> 01:22:13.395
REALLY WHETHER MUCH RUBBER MEETS

01:22:13.461 --> 01:22:15.997
THE ROAD IS NOT INSIDE THE

01:22:16.064 --> 01:22:17.198
CHANCES OF HIS OUT OF THE

01:22:17.265 --> 01:22:18.199
COMMUNITY COLLEGES ACROSS THE

01:22:18.266 --> 01:22:20.502
STATE RIGHT. THAT'S WHERE THEY

01:22:20.568 --> 01:22:22.337
NEED THE SERVICES. SO I JUST.

01:22:22.404 --> 01:22:24.239
SEEMS LIKE A LOT TO ME TODAY BUT

01:22:24.306 --> 01:22:27.609
WILL. HAVE FURTHER CONVERSATIONS

01:22:27.676 --> 01:22:29.210
ABOUT THAT I PRE EIGHT. THE

01:22:29.277 --> 01:22:32.847
PERSPECTIVE YOU- AND THANK YOU.

01:22:32.914 --> 01:22:36.251
THANK YOU THAT QUESTION FOR THE

01:22:36.318 --> 01:22:38.053
I THINK BY THE L. A. L. SO I

01:22:38.119 --> 01:22:41.289
THINK THAT THE REVENUE FOR PROP

01:22:41.356 --> 01:22:43.491
NINETY EIGHT IS SIMILAR FROM

01:22:43.558 --> 01:22:46.027
WHAT'S IN FINANCE FROM WHAT YOU

01:22:46.094 --> 01:22:47.929
HAD ALLOCATED IN WHAT ARE. KIND

01:22:47.996 --> 01:22:50.198
OF SPREAD SHEETS AND ANALYSIS

01:22:50.265 --> 01:22:52.167
HAS PER PROP NINETY EIGHT. AND I

01:22:52.233 --> 01:22:54.235
THINK THE DIFFERENCE IS. THE

01:22:54.302 --> 01:22:58.406
ADMINISTRATION HAS HAS- MORE ONE

01:22:58.473 --> 01:23:00.175
TIME WITH ONGOING MONEY. SAID

01:23:00.241 --> 01:23:03.511
THEYUSE THE USE OF BIG CHUNK TO

01:23:03.578 --> 01:23:05.480
PUT IN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE.

01:23:05.547 --> 01:23:06.848
WHAT FOR IT WHICH IS A ONE TIME

01:23:06.915 --> 01:23:09.017
THING WITH ONGOING MONEY SO THAT

01:23:09.084 --> 01:23:10.819
YOU KNOW YOU CAN USE THAT OTHER

01:23:10.885 --> 01:23:12.220
PLACES WELL WORD OF COURSE

01:23:12.287 --> 01:23:14.356
EVALUATING THAT. AND THEN IF WE

01:23:14.422 --> 01:23:15.924
HAVE THIS OTHER DEBATE ABOUT

01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:17.726
THIS WHAT MR O'DONNELL PROBABLY

01:23:17.792 --> 01:23:20.395
KNOWS THAT EVEN WITH THIS YOU

01:23:20.462 --> 01:23:22.464
KNOW COSTS HAVE GONE UP- YOU

01:23:22.530 --> 01:23:23.565
KNOW COSTS FOR DISTRICTS

01:23:23.631 --> 01:23:25.200
EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION RETIREMENT

01:23:25.266 --> 01:23:27.469
COSTS AND SO FORTH SO EVEN

01:23:27.535 --> 01:23:28.536
THOUGH WE'RE HAVING THIS

01:23:28.603 --> 01:23:31.039
HISTORIC BOB YOU KNOW IT'S

01:23:31.106 --> 01:23:32.207
ALMOST EVEN WITH WHAT THEIR

01:23:32.273 --> 01:23:34.342
COSTS ARE SO THEN THAT OTHER

01:23:34.409 --> 01:23:36.411
PIECE THIS EQUATION IS THIS

01:23:36.478 --> 01:23:37.445
FUNDING FORMULA AND SOME

01:23:37.512 --> 01:23:39.647
DISTRICTS WERE. ARMLESS AS WE

01:23:39.714 --> 01:23:41.616
TRY TO IMPLEMENT THIS FROM A FEW

01:23:41.683 --> 01:23:43.251
YEARS AGO. WHERE ARE WE AT AND

01:23:43.318 --> 01:23:46.254
WHAT WHAT. MORE WOULD BE NEED TO

01:23:46.321 --> 01:23:49.090
GET ALL DISTRICTS TO BE.

01:23:49.157 --> 01:23:52.594
SENSUALLY HOLE WITH THIS FUNDING

01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:54.262
FORMULA WITH THE WHOLE HOLD

01:23:54.329 --> 01:23:55.797
HARMLESS STUFF SO IT WHAT WHAT

01:23:55.864 --> 01:23:58.066
MORE RESOURCES WILL BE NEEDED TO

01:23:58.133 --> 01:24:00.101
ADDRESS THE- IMPLEMENTATION OF

01:24:00.168 --> 01:24:02.504
THE FUNDING FORMULA CHANGES.

01:24:02.570 --> 01:24:04.506
SURE WE'LL JUST REGROUP WITH

01:24:04.572 --> 01:24:08.676
REGARD YEAR- FIRST- INQUIRY ON

01:24:08.743 --> 01:24:10.779
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT THAT'S

01:24:10.845 --> 01:24:13.214
CORRECT THE- THERE IS A CERTAIN

01:24:13.281 --> 01:24:16.251
AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT CAN CAN BE

01:24:16.317 --> 01:24:18.019
SPENT IN AN ONGOING WAY I'M

01:24:18.086 --> 01:24:19.554
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT WHAT

01:24:19.621 --> 01:24:21.289
THE GOVERNOR CHOOSES WITH NAY

01:24:21.356 --> 01:24:24.392
REVISION IS TO DEDICATE A FAIR

01:24:24.459 --> 01:24:25.460
AMOUNT OF THAT TO ONE TIME

01:24:25.527 --> 01:24:27.829
PURPOSES KIND OF A- CUSHION IN

01:24:27.896 --> 01:24:29.664
CASE THERE IS A DOWNTURN FUTURE

01:24:29.731 --> 01:24:32.534
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO BACK IN AND

01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:33.802
MAKE PROGRAMMATIC CUTS YU NOTED

01:24:33.868 --> 01:24:35.637
TO BASE. PROGRAM SET BUT THAT'S

01:24:35.703 --> 01:24:37.572
A DECISION FOR LEGISLATURES SIDE

01:24:37.639 --> 01:24:39.441
LEGISLATURE OF COURSE DECIDES ON

01:24:39.507 --> 01:24:41.476
ALLOCATIONS SO YOU MAY DECIDE TO

01:24:41.543 --> 01:24:44.245
PUT MORE MONEY INTO ON GOING-

01:24:44.312 --> 01:24:46.080
PURPOSES FOR THAT COMMITTEE

01:24:46.147 --> 01:24:47.115
COLLEGES ARE K. TWELVE FOR THAT

01:24:47.182 --> 01:24:49.884
MATTER- THEN THE GOVERNOR DOES

01:24:49.951 --> 01:24:52.787
ON THE STUDENT CENTERED. FUNDING

01:24:52.854 --> 01:24:57.559
FORMULA. ARE CURRENTLY THERE IS

01:24:57.625 --> 01:24:59.861
ONE DISTRICT THAT IS ACTUALLY

01:24:59.928 --> 01:25:02.397
FUNDED BY THE FORMULA. THE

01:25:02.464 --> 01:25:03.198
STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA

01:25:03.264 --> 01:25:05.366
THE REST ARE FUNDED BY WHAT'S

KNOWN AS STABILITY. OR ANOTHER

01:25:08.403 --> 01:25:10.104
PROVISION A HOLD HARMLESS

01:25:10.171 --> 01:25:12.173
PROVISION SO ONLY ONE. WE'VE

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:14.175
STARTED LOOKING IT AT MODELING

01:25:14.242 --> 01:25:15.310
AND WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S

01:25:15.376 --> 01:25:18.146
PROPOSAL- COULD DO- THAT'S

OUTLAY PROPOSAL'S. GENERALLY WE

01:37:09.123 --> 01:37:10.291
THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO FOCUS

01:37:10.357 --> 01:37:12.326
ON A ONE TIME CAPITAL OUTLAY

01:37:12.393 --> 01:37:14.395

THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT

01:37:25.539 --> 01:37:26.774
CALCULATION. THAT SAID THIS

01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:28.809

01:37:28.876 --> 01:37:31.145

01:37:43.224 --> 01:37:44.325
AFFORDABLE STUDENT HOUSING WHICH

01:37:44.391 --> 01:37:46.060

01:37:48.729 --> 01:37:49.897

01:37:49.964 --> 01:37:51.599

THINK THIS IS THE KIND OF OPPOSE

01:38:12.052 --> 01:38:12.953
A LEGISLATURE COULD REJECT THIS

01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:14.154

ANNUAL JANUARY BUDGET- WE THINK

01:45:12.272 --> 01:45:13.974
A LOT OF THAT IS FINANCIAL AID.

01:45:14.041 --> 01:45:15.742

FINANCIAL AID PLANS WE'RE ALSO

01:46:14.301 --> 01:46:16.336
HOPING THAT THE FEDERAL

01:46:16.403 --> 01:46:17.370
GOVERNMENT WILL EXPAND THE PELL

01:46:17.437 --> 01:46:20.373

LEGISLATURE SO THE STUDENTS

01:46:32.886 --> 01:46:34.888
WOULD STILL HAVE TO EITHER WORK

01:46:34.955 --> 01:46:36.623
AND THEY IF THEY CHOOSE NOT TO

01:46:36.690 --> 01:46:38.158

YOU KNOW I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S

01:46:58.411 --> 01:47:00.413

01:53:49.389 --> 01:53:50.857
PROBLEMATIC WHEN YOU CONSIDER

01:53:50.924 --> 01:53:52.992
THAT THE STATE ALLOCATES FUNDING

THESE GROWING DISPARITIES IS

01:54:22.355 --> 01:54:23.823

02:03:50.756 --> 02:03:53.559
STUDENT MAY BE FORCED TO TAKE

02:03:53.626 --> 02:03:55.594

02:03:55.661 --> 02:03:58.264
AT YOU SEE IS JUST UNDER

02:03:58.330 --> 02:03:59.565
EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR

02:03:59.632 --> 02:04:00.599
THOSE STUDENTS WHO TAKE OUT

02:04:00.666 --> 02:04:02.334
LOANS AT THAT'S A GRADUATION

02:04:02.401 --> 02:04:04.370
THEIR TOTAL LOANS. OF THAT IS

02:04:04.436 --> 02:04:07.907
MUCH LOWER THAN OTHER- OTHER

02:04:07.973 --> 02:04:10.142
AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES SO WE ARE

02:04:10.209 --> 02:04:12.077
DOING FAIRLY WELL AND TRYING TO

02:04:12.144 --> 02:04:14.313
KEEP THAT UP LOAD UNDER CONTROL

02:04:14.380 --> 02:04:16.215
BUT THE OF RISING COSTS OF

02:04:16.282 --> 02:04:19.118
HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA- IS REALLY

02:04:19.185 --> 02:04:20.920
PUTTING PRESSURE ON STUDENTS AND

02:04:20.986 --> 02:04:22.254
THEIR FAMILIES TO COME UP WITH

02:04:22.321 --> 02:04:23.889
THAT EXTRA MONEY TO PAY FOR THAT

02:04:23.956 --> 02:04:25.825
HOUSING. THAT'S WHY THE

02:04:25.891 --> 02:04:27.927
ASSEMBLY'S PLANS OF INCREASING

02:04:27.993 --> 02:04:29.495
THE AFFORDABLE STUDENT HOUSING

02:04:29.562 --> 02:04:31.096
GRANT PROGRAM SO THT THE

02:04:31.163 --> 02:04:32.531
UNIVERSITY COULD BUILD MORE

02:04:32.598 --> 02:04:34.200
DORMITORIES IT'S A IT'S A VERY

02:04:34.266 --> 02:04:35.935
GOOD PLAN THAT WILL HAVE LONG

02:04:36.001 --> 02:04:38.137
TERM POSITIVE CONSEQUENCES. FOR

02:04:38.204 --> 02:04:42.541
MANY STUDENTS BUT WE ARE LOOKING

02:04:42.608 --> 02:04:43.909
AT THESE COSTS UNFORTUNATELY.

02:04:43.976 --> 02:04:45.744
THE UNIVERSITY DOES NOT CONTROL

02:04:45.811 --> 02:04:48.514
FRONT COST NEAR THE CAMPUSES OF

02:04:48.581 --> 02:04:50.049
THE LANDLORDS ARE ABLE TO RAISE

02:04:50.115 --> 02:04:51.951
THE RENT OUT AND FINANCIAL AID

02:04:52.017 --> 02:04:54.253
IS NOT ABLE TO KEEP UP ALWAYS

02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:59.692
WITH THOSE COSTS. SURE HOPE.

02:04:59.758 --> 02:05:04.830
JERRY SUMMARIZE- AS IF- SHARON

02:05:04.897 --> 02:05:09.368
THAT IS INCURRING NOW FROM THE

02:05:09.435 --> 02:05:12.204
STUDENTS SO WHO DO NOT HAVE

02:05:12.271 --> 02:05:14.039

02:05:19.211 --> 02:05:21.914
SUFFICIENT TO COVER EVERYTHING

02:05:21.981 --> 02:05:24.250
AND THEN THEY END UP. WITH THE

02:05:24.316 --> 02:05:29.121
MORE THAT. AND- SO IN OTHER

02:05:29.188 --> 02:05:33.592

THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION

02:26:42.527 --> 02:26:44.762
ONGOING. WAS BASED ON THE PRIOR

02:26:44.829 --> 02:26:46.063
ESTIMATES OF STUDENT MOMENT

02:26:46.130 --> 02:26:47.698
PARTICIPATION SO WE'LL BE

02:26:47.765 --> 02:26:49.534
WORKING UPDATE THOSE NUMBERS BUT

02:26:49.600 --> 02:26:53.371
CERTAINLY- THREE FIFTEEN LESS

02:26:53.437 --> 02:26:54.672

LOOK TO FOCUS ON. THE OUT YEARS

02:27:02.980 --> 02:27:06.217
AND SO AGAIN THIS IS GONNA BE IN

02:27:06.284 --> 02:27:09.053
OUR PROPOSAL. IT IS A TOP-

02:27:09.120 --> 02:27:11.556

DON'T WANT TO RAISE THREE ISSUES

02:34:56.220 --> 02:34:57.488
FOR CONSIDERATION AS YOU'RE

02:34:57.554 --> 02:34:59.189
THINKING ABOUT THIS PROJECT. THE

02:34:59.256 --> 02:35:00.991
FIRST IS THAT THIS PROJECT IS

02:35:01.058 --> 02:35:04.328
BEING PROPOSED OUTSIDE OF THE OF

02:35:04.395 --> 02:35:05.329
AFFORDABLE STUDENT HOUSING GRANT

02:35:05.396 --> 02:35:08.065
PROGRAM- THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS

02:35:08.132 --> 02:35:09.299
PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED IF YOU

02:35:09.366 --> 02:35:10.734
RECALL THIS HE SINGS ACTUALLY

02:35:10.801 --> 02:35:12.603
SUBMITTED A GROUP APPLICATION TO

PARTICIPATE IN THAT PROGRAM AND

02:35:14.204 --> 02:35:15.973
WAS DEEMED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:35:16.040 --> 02:35:18.008
FINANCE TO BE INELIGIBLE. ON

02:35:18.075 --> 02:35:19.276
BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE HASN'T

02:35:19.343 --> 02:35:21.345
FINALIZED HOW IT INTENDS TO

02:35:21.412 --> 02:35:23.013
REFLECT PROJECTS IN THE GRANT

02:35:23.080 --> 02:35:24.114
PROGRAM IT'S DIFFICULT TO

02:35:24.181 --> 02:35:27.117
ASSESS. HOW THIS. SPECIFIC

02:35:27.184 --> 02:35:29.453
PROJECT- IT'S CHECKS UP AGAINST

02:35:29.520 --> 02:35:32.523
THOSE OF OTHER PROJECTS IN THE

02:35:32.589 --> 02:35:33.924
GRANT PROGRAM. THE SECOND ISSUE

02:35:33.991 --> 02:35:35.659
I WANT TO RAISE IS THAT-

02:35:35.726 --> 02:35:36.994

THE PROPOSED RENTS FOR THE

02:35:44.268 --> 02:35:46.704
BUILDING WOULD BE ABOUT 30% OF

02:35:46.770 --> 02:35:48.639
EIGHTY PERCENT. OF THE SCHOOLS

02:35:48.706 --> 02:35:50.207
AREA MEDIAN INCOME. THAT'S

02:35:50.274 --> 02:35:54.244

SOMEWHERE ELSE RIGHT WELL THE

02:46:39.956 --> 02:46:41.791
A THERE'S A BROADER ISSUE WITH

02:46:41.858 --> 02:46:43.693
THESE FEDERAL WAIVERS RIGHT THAT

02:46:43.760 --> 02:46:45.261
THAT THEY PUT IN PLACE DIFFERENT

02:46:45.328 --> 02:46:47.831
RULES TO FACILITATE HANDING OUT

02:46:47.897 --> 02:46:48.898

SCHOOL IS UP CLOSE IT IS

02:47:30.807 --> 02:47:31.808
SPECIALLY DURING THE SUMMERTIME

02:47:31.875 --> 02:47:32.809
YEAH WELL THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT
