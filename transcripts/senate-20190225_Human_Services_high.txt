ON HUMAN SERVICES HEARING FOR CARING FOR CARE GIVERS OF OLDER ADULTS RECOGNIZING. THAT BENEFITS NEEDS OF FAMILY CARE GIVERS. THIS IS OUR FIRST HEARING WITH THEIR NEWLY FORMED COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP SO I'D LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU IN THE COMING YEAR. IT'S GOING TO BE AN EXCITING YEAR AS WE CONSIDER POLICY THAT WILL HOPEFULLY IMPROVE THE LIVES OF SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE CITIZENS. TODAY WE'RE FOCUSING ON THE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE CARE GIVING FOR OLDER LOVED ONES. OFTEN WITHOUT EARLY WARNING OR PREPARATION AND WITHOUT PAYING. AGING ACCIDENTS AND ILLNESSES TOUCH ALL OF OUR LIVES. WHEN PEOPLE BECOME INJURED ILL HORTON FROM DATE OFTEN NEED IN HOME ASSISTANCE WITH TAX LIKE BABY IN SHOPPING OR ATTENDING MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS? WITHOUT THIS ASSISTANCE MANY WOULD END UP IN NURSING HOMES OR YET HOSPITALIZED. IT IS DURING THESE CIRCUMSTANCES ONE FAMILY MEMBER STEP UP AND PROVIDE THE CARE NECESSARY TO KEEP LOVE ONCE IN THEIR HOMES. CARE GIVING WHILE OFTEN VERY WAR NEAT REWARDING CONSTRAINT CARE GIVERS FINANCES HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH. WE ARE HERE TODAY TO EXPLORE THE SYSTEM OF SERVICES AND SUPPORTS AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR FAMILY CARE GIVERS. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS ANOTHER VERY IMPORTANT TYPE OF FAMILY CARE GIVERS THOSE CARING FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES THE COMPLEX SYSTEMS THAT SERVE OLDER AND ADULTS AND INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES OFTEN TOUCH ONE ANOTHER. AND CARE GIVERS IN BOTH SYSTEMS ALSO FACE THE MERRY OUT OF CHALLENGES. SOME OF WHICH MAY BE VERY SIMILAR TO THOSE DISCUSS TODAY WHILE WE RECOGNIZE THE INCREDIBLY INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ROLE ALL FAMILY CAREGIVERS PLAY. TODAY'S HEARING FOCUSES ON THE NEEDS OF FAMILY CARE GIVERS FOR OLDER ADULTS. I'D LIKE TO GIVE MY FELLOW COMMITTEE MEMBERS AN OPPORTUNITY AN OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE OPENING STATEMENTS. THANK YOU US SENATOR HER TAUGHT -- CONGRATULATIONS ON BEING ON THE CHAIR OF THIS WONDERFUL COMMITTEE AND I'M HONORED TO BE YOUR VICE CHAIR AND AND TO WORK WITH YOU I THINK WE WILL HAVE A PASSION -- FOR PEOPLE WITH SPECIAL SPECIAL NEEDS WHETHER THEY'RE YOUNG PEOPLE OR OLDER PEOPLE -- HAVE BEEN THE GRANDFATHER OF A SIX YEAR OLD -- ARTISTIC -- CHILD WHO I I LOVE TO PIECES -- I OBVIOUSLY WANT TO SEE WHAT I CAN AS A AS A LECTOR OFFICIAL THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO ASSUME THAT.

FOR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS PANELISTS PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELF AND TELL US YOUR AFFILIATION WHEN IT IS YOUR TURN TO PRESENT. MR PRINT EVIL PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY [inaudible] FOR CALLING [inaudible] I'M. NINA AND AS LONG AS WELL PLEASE IF YOU DON'T MIND COMING UP THANK YOU [inaudible] GOOD AFTERNOON. HEAR ME OKAY. OTHER THREE THINGS I WOULD LIKE YOU O TAKE AWAY FROM MY COMMENTS TODAY. THE FIRST AS IT'S BEEN TOUCHED ON IS THAT THE EXPERIENCE OF AGING IN FAMILY CARE GIVING IMPACTS ALL OF US. THE SECOND HIS IT WALK CARE GIVING DOES IN FACT IMPACT ALL OF US THERE ARE SOME ISSUES THAT ARISE IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES THAT MAKE THE IMPACT IN THOSE COMMUNITIES EVEN MORE INTENSE. AND FINALLY WE AS A STATE CAN AND MUST TAKE BOLD ACTION TO BETTER SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S FAMILY CARE GIVERS AND THE OLD OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES THAT THEY SIR. I'M KEVIN PRINTED ON THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR THAT JUSTICE AN AGENT WE'RE A NONPROFIT LEGAL ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION THAT USES THE POWER OF LAW TO FIGHT SENIOR POVERTY. WE WORK TO ENSURE THAT STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTSARE PROVIDING THE RESOURCES AND SERVICES THAT ARE NEEDED BY A COMMUNITIES THAT ARE GROWING OLD AND POVERTY. ESPECIALLY THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MORE LIKELY TO GROW OLD AND POVERTY INCLUDING WOMEN. PEOPLE OF COLOR IMMIGRANTS IN LGBT KEEP. IN ADDITION A CARRYING ABOUT THESE ISSUES -- BECAUSE OF THE WORK I DO PROFESSIONALLY THEY'RE AWESOME ALSO ISSUES THAT HAVE IMPACTED ME PERSONALLY -- MY MOTHER PASSED THIS LAST SUMMER AND FOR THE FIVE YEARS PREVIOUS TO THAT I WAS ONE OF HER CARE GIVER SAYS SHE LIVE THROUGH A TERMINAL ILLNESS. AND I SUPPORT MY FATHER WHO IS HER PRIMARY CARE GIVER. SO I THINK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN A COMMITMENT TO THESE ISSUES ARE AGING AND DISABILITY ADVOCACY COMMUNITIES ARE THRILLED TO HAVE SUCH COMMITTED PARTNERS WORKING TO TAKE NEW ACTION IN BOLD ACTION TO BETTER SUPPORT THE COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. NOW AS I SAID THE EXPERIENCE OF AGING IN THE FAMILY CAREGIVING IMPACTS ALL OF US IT'S REALLY THE PERFECT ISSUE THROUGH WHICH TO EXAMINE. AGING POLICY ISSUES BECAUSE YOU CAN REALLY SEE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE CARE GIVER HOW AGING IMPACTS NOT JUST THE OLDER ADULT OR THE PERSON WITH THE DISABILITY BUT THE ENTIRE FAMILY THE COMMUNITY. THE GOVERNMENT'S EMPLOYERS ARE ECONOMY EVERYONE IS IMPACTED MANY OF US IN THIS ROOM HAVE PROVIDED CARE TO A FAMILY MEMBER -- NEEDED CARE FROM A FAMILY MEMBER. AND IF YOU HAVEN'T YET YOU LIKELY WILL AND IF YOU HAVEN'T YET YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO HAS SOMEONE ELSE IN YOUR FAMILY A COLLEAGUE OF FRIENDS YOU KNOW FAMILY CARE GIVERS THAT ARE GOING THROUGH THESE ISSUES RIGHT NOW IN THEIR LIVES. IN FACT IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S AN ESTIMATED FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION FAMILY CARE GIVERS THAT PROVIDE SERVICES WORTH AN ESTIMATED FIFTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. CALIFORNIA LIKE THE REST OF THE COUNTRY IS GROWING RAPIDLY -- THE AGING POPULATION IS GROWING RAPIDLY OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE SIXTY FIVE AND OVER IN THE STATE WILL GROW BY FOUR MILLION AND IT'S A TREND THAT CONTINUES. INTO THE TIME WHEN I WILL BE IN OLDER ADULTS SO I'M PART OF THE SILVER SNOBBY AS WELL THIS IS NOT A ISSUE THAT'S JUST RESTRICTED TO PEOPLE. THAT ARE OLDER NOW OUR ON THE COST OF BECOMING OLDER IT'S KIDS AND GENERATIONS TO COME. AS OUR POPULATION AGES WE ARE SEEING AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF OLDER ADULTS THAT NEED LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER 70% WILL NEED CARE TO REMAIN SAFELY AT HOME. AND UNFORTUNATELY THE COST OF CARE IS ON AFFORDABLE BUT ALL TO ALL BUT THE WEALTHIEST OF CALIFORNIANS AND MY COLLEAGUES WILL GO INTO SOME MORE DETAIL ABOUT THOSE NUMBERS. AND WE DON'T HAVE IS A STATE A PROGRAM THAT WILL COVER THOSE COSTS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS MEDICARE HAS A WONDERFUL HEALTH CARE PROGRAM BUT IT COVERS ONLY LIMITED LONG TERM CARE. MEDI CAL DOES COVER LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS AND IN FACT AS THE PRIMARY PAYER OF L. TSS IN THE STATE. BUT IT'S ONLY AVAILABLE TO EXTREMELY LOW INCOME PEOPLE OR TO MIDDLE INCOME PEOPLE AFTER THEY'VE EXHAUSTED ALL OF THEIR INCOME AND ASSETS TO QUALIFY FOR THE PROGRAM. AND EVEN THEN IT DOESN'T COVER EVERYTHING THAT PEOPLE NEED. SO IT'S IN THIS CONTEXT THAT FAMILY CARE GIVER STEP UP. AND THEY PROVIDE THE CRITICAL FUNCTION THAT THEY DO -- THEY HELP IN A WIDE VARIETY OF WAYS LARGE AND SMALL THEY HELP WITH RUNNING ERRANDS AND GETTING TO DOCTORS APPOINTMENTS THEY HELP WITH ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING LIKE BAITING AND TOILETING DRESSING EATING AND MORE. HELP WITH MEDICATION MANAGEMENT AND HEALTH MONITORING. THE HELP WITH MEDICAL CARE THEY ADVOCATE WITH DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS AND THEY DO THIS ALL TO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS SO THEY CAN STAY AT HOME IN THE COMMUNITY. THAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO THAT'S WHERE PEOPLE OR AS THEY HAVE MORE COMPLEX NEEDS. BUT IT'S ALSO GOOD POLICY FAMILY CAREGIVERS HELP KEEP PEOPLE AT HOME WHICH SAVES THE STATE MONEY. BECAUSE IT'S MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE TO CARE FOR PEOPLE AT HOME THAN AND MORE COSTLY INSTITUTIONS. BUT FAMILY CAREGIVERS DO ALL THIS AT TREMENDOUS COST MENTAL COST EMOTIONAL COSTS PHYSICAL COST AND ECONOMIC COST TO THEMSELVES. AND THEIR FAMILIES AND TO OUR KEEP OUR ECONOMY. THEY MISS OUT ON WAGES THEY SPEND MONEY OUT OF THEIR OWN POCKET TO PROVIDE THIS CARE. AND ECONOMIC COSTS FEEDING INTERGENERATIONAL CYCLE OF ECONOMIC AND SECURITY AND POVERTY IN MANY FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. SO THAT BRINGS ME TO MY SECOND CRITICAL POINT. WALK CARE GIVING IMPACTS ALL OF US IT IMPACTS SOME OF US MORE. THE PROCESS OF CARING FOR A FAMILY MEMBER IS AN EXTREME CHALLENGE EVEN FOR THE WEALTHIEST FAMILIES. AND IT'S EVEN MORE OF A CHALLENGE THAT'S COMPOUNDED BY ECONOMIC AND SECURITY FOR LOW INCOME AND MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES. IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THE HIGHEST RATE OF SENIOR POVERTY IN THE COUNTRY. ONE IN FIVE SENIORS IN CALIFORNIA'S LIVES IN POVERTY. AND EVEN MORE ARE JUST ABOVE THE POVERTY LEVEL. STRUGGLING TO JUST MEET BASIC NEEDS LIKE HOUSING AND FOOD AND TRANSPORTATION. SO IMAGINE GOING THROUGH THE DIFFICULTY OF PROVIDING -- IN CARING FOR A FAMILY MEMBER WITH A LONG TERM IF YOU ALSO ARE WORRIED ABOUT HOW YOU WILL PAY THE RENT OR HOW HE WILL AFFORD FOOD THAT MONTH. ONE FAMILY STEP IN TO HELP. WITH THE ECONOMICALLY AND SECURE OLDER ADULTS THAT JUST DEPLETES THE INCOME AND ASSETS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THE WHOLE FAMILY. AND INCREASES THE CHANCES THAT THE NEXT GENERATION THAT FAMILY AND THE ONE AFTER THAT WILL ALSO AGENT THE POVERTY. IT'S IMPORTANT OUT THAT ANOTHER POPULATION THAT'S PARTICULARLY IMPACTED BY CARE GIVING IS WOMEN. WOMEN PROVIDE 60% OF A FAMILY CARE GIVING SERVICES IN THE STATE IN THE COUNTRY ACTUALLY AND WOMEN AVERAGE THIRTEEN YEARS OF NO EARNINGS. DUE TO CAREGIVING RESPONSIBILITIES. THE RESULT IS THAT WOMEN ARE MORE THAN TWICE AS LIKELY AS MEN TO AGE INTO POVERTY. ANOTHER GROUP PARTICULARLY IMPACTED BY FAMILY CARE GIVING ARE BLACK AND LATINO X. FAMILIES. WERE CARE GIVER SPEND AS MUCH AS GIVING EXPENSES. AS WITH WOMEN THE ECONOMIC COSTS OF CARE GIVING FOR THIS GROUP CONTRIBUTE TO HIGHER RATES OF POVERTY AS THEY AGE. SO MY THIRD AND FINAL POINT WE AS A STATE CAN AND MUST TAKE BOLD ACTION TO BETTER SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S FAMILY CARE GIVERS AN OLDER ADULTS WITH DISABILITIES. THAT THEY CARE. FOR CALIFORNIA HAS SEVERAL PROGRAMS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO ASSIST IN SUPPORT FAMILY CAREGIVERS BUT MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS. HAVE NOT BEEN EXPANDED TO KEEP PACE WITH GROWING NEEDS AND IN SOME CASES THEY'VE ACTUALLY BEEN CUT BACK. SO NOW IS THE TIME TO IMPROVE AND EXPAND THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDING EYEQ ASSESS THE COORDINATED CARE INITIATIVE. COMMUNITY BASED ADULT SERVICES THE EMPHASIS P. PRO IS THE EIGHTY ARE SEIZE LEGAL SERVICES AND MORE. AND AS WE SEEK TO BETTER SUPPORT FAMILY CAREGIVERS WE NEED TO GO ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT WE'RE DOING TO TODAY WE NEED TO THINK BOLDLY AND TAKE ACTION TO CREATE A MASTER PLAN FOR AGING HAS BEEN CALLED AS HAS BEEN CALLED FOR BY THE GOVERNOR. AND BY OTHERS IN THIS BODY. AT PLAN SHOULD INCLUDE SUPPORT FOR FAMILY CAREGIVERS AND ALSO IN OCCURRED INTERCONNECTED ISSUES LIKE ELDER ECONOMIC SECURITY. HEALTH CARE ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY ORAL HEALTH CARE I JUST SETS IMPROVEMENTS ELDER ABUSE THE PAGER CARE GIVER WORK FOR SOME MORE. THE PLAN TO PLACE IT CENTER ISSUES OF EQUITY HOW CAN WE DESIGN OUR SYSTEMS TO ADDRESS SYSTEMIC INEQUITIES. THAT RESULT IN DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES AND OUTCOMES AMONG OLDER PEOPLE AS THEY AGE. AND HOW CAN WE CREATE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT ARE CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY APPROPRIATE. WE MUST INCLUDE NEW IDEAS THE WILL PROVIDE IMMEDIATE RELIEF TO CARE GIVERS LIKE MAKING IT EASIER TO QUALIFY FOR MEDICARE. IMPROVING ACCESS TO ORAL HEALTH THE CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT OF INTEGRATED PERSON CENTERED CARE SYSTEMS AND INCREASED ACCESS TO EIGHT CBS. AND FINALLY WE MUST BE WORKING TOWARDS AN AMBITIOUS NEW PROGRAM FOR FINANCING AND PROVIDING LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS LIKE THE ONE INTRODUCED EARLIER TODAY BY SENATOR PAN. AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA. AN EFFECTIVE PROGRAM FOR PROVIDING LTE ASSESS WILL PRIOR PRIORITIZE KEEPING PEOPLE AT HOME. RELIEVING THE ECONOMIC BURDEN PLACED ON FAMILY CAREGIVERS CREATING IT FAIR AND JUST WORK ENVIRONMENT FOR PAID CARE GIVERS AND SAVING LOW INCOME AND MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES. FROM HAVING TO SPEND ON ALL OF THEIR INCOME AND ASSETS TO JUST TO GET THE HELP THAT THEY NEED. WITH LEADERS LIKE YOU COMMITTED TO THESE ISSUES WE NOW HAVE A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ACTION AND TO ADDRESS A COMPELLING NEED IN OUR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS HEARING THANK YOU FOR YOUR THE SHIP WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON I'M YOU KNOW WHY THE HER WELL WITH A OR P. ASSOCIATE STATE DIRECTOR. HERE ON BEHALF OF WE'RE ACTUALLY MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION REPRESENTING FIFTY PLUS CALIFORNIANS WE HAVE NEARLY THREE POINT THREE MILLION MEMBERS. BEFORE YOU START I WANT TO JUST THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR ITS INTEREST IN THIS ISSUE AND THE EXCELLENT REPORT THAT IT CAME OUT OVER THE WEEKEND. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW REFRESHING IT IS TO HAVE A COMMITTEE THAT'S WILLING TO ROLL UP ITS SLEEVE AND FLEE THE BEGIN NOW THIS COUNTIES IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS. SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO TODAY IS. KEVIN PROVIDED EXCELLENT OVERVIEW SO I WON'T REPEAT A LOT OF THE DATA BUT I DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT -- FREE MY REMARKS WITH. I THE HIGH COST OF LONG TERM SUPPORTS AND SERVICES OR L. T. ASENATH. BECAUSE IT REALLY PROVIDES THE CONTEXT. IN PART WHY WE MUST RELY ON FAMILY CARE GIVERS TO PROVIDE CARE FOR BOTH OUR AGING AND DISABLED FAMILY MEMBERS. BUT IT ALSO REALLY TELLS US THE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ANOTHER CHOICE. AS KEVIN NOTED MEDICARE PROVIDES LIMITED BENEFITS A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN'T QUALIFY AND WHERE YOU HAVE TO SPEND DOWN TO QUALIFY FOR MEDI CAL. THE SIMPLE FACT IS AN THIS IS ACCORDING TO A OR ANY OTHER PEOPLE REPORT THAT WAS JUST PUBLISHED LAST YEAR. L. TSS COST MORE THAN MOST CALIFORNIANS. CAN AFFORD. THE AVERAGE OLDER CALIFORNIAN HOUSEHOLDS HAS A MEDIAN INCOME OF FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND ONE IN THREE ACTUALLY 36% OF OLDER CALIFORNIANS OVER. SIXTY FIVE LIVED BELOW 210050% OF THE POVERTY LEVEL IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN AT THE SAME TIME. MOST FOLKS REQUIRED OR WOULD NEED TO SHOULDER THE BURDEN OF HIGH COSTS SUCH AS A HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. FOR A PRIVATE NURSING HOME ROOM IN A NURSING FACILITY AND NINETY SEVEN THOUSAND FOR A SHARED ROOM. EVEN LOOKING AT SAY ASSISTANT ASSISTED LIVING THAT BASE COST IS FIFTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR THAT'S THE SAME AS THE MEDIAN INCOME -- EVEN IF HOME HEALTH CARE THIRTY HOURS A WEEK. IS ACCORDING TO A A RP ESTIMATES THIRTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. AT THE SAME TIME I KNOW SOMETIMES I HEAR FOLKS SAY WHAT ABOUT LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE I THINK MOST MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE NOW. LESS THAN 5% OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE IS NOT A VIABLE OPTION. THAT MEANS THAT CAL OLDER. OLDER AND DISABLED CALIFORNIANS HAVE TO RELY ON A FAMILY CARE GIVER IF THEY HAVE. ONE TO HELP THEM WHEN THEY ARE NEEDED IN NEED OF ASSISTANCE AND OF COURSE FEW CAN AFFORD TO PAY TO PRIVATE PAY FOR KIM. WE THEN PUT THIS BALL GO FAMILY CARE GIVING ON THESE FAMILY CARE GIVERS MOST OF WHOM WORK -- AND IS KEVIN NOTED ESTIMATES ARE NEARLY FOUR AND A HALF MILLION CALIFORNIANS OR FAMILY CAREGIVERS. SO YES MANY FAMILIES DO THIS OUT OF LOVE AND DUTY. AND THEY DO THIS IS ALSO BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THIS IS WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS DONE. IT SAYS HOW ON A SHOW RESPECT AND HOW I PAY MY PARENTS BACK FOR HOW THEY HELP ME BUT THAT'S A TREMENDOUS BURDEN. TO CARRY WHEN YOU WERE IN THE AVERAGE FAMILY CARE GIVER WAS FORTY NINE YEARS OLD WORKING THIRTY FIVE HOURS A WEEK. IN ADDITION IT'S NOT JUST THE FACT THAT FOLKS ARE WORKING BUT OUR RESEARCH FROM TWENTY SIXTEEN FOUND THAT THE AVERAGE FAMILY CARE GIVER FOR AN OLDER INDIVIDUAL. SPENDS NEARLY SEVENTH A POCKET EVERY YEAR. AND FOR SOMEBODY CARING FOR AN INDIVIDUAL WITHOUT SUMMERS AND OTHER DEMENTIAS IT'S OVER TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. A RESEARCH ALSO FOUND THAT LETTING NECKS. CARE GIVERS SPEND OVER NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU. IN ADDITION OUT OLDER STUDY FROM MET LIFE FROM EARLIER THIS DECADE FOUND THAT THE LOST WAGES FOR YOUR TYPICAL CARE GIVER. WAS OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A THAT DOESN'T EVEN COUNT SAY THE LOS SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS. WE KNOW THAT CARE GIVERS HAVE REPORTED EMOTIONAL PHYSICAL AND HEALTH RELATED STRAIN AS WELL. WE ARE PUTTING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF BURDEN ON OUR CARE GIVERS ASKING TO AWFUL I ASKING WAR IMPLYING THAT THEY SHOULD BE THE PRIMARY SUPPORTER FOR AN AILING FAMILY MEMBER. BUT MOST ARE GETTING VERY LITTLE SUPPORT -- FOR EXAMPLE OR CAN GIVE A RESOURCE CENTERS. WHICH IS ONE OF THE FEW STATE SOLELY STATE BASED PROGRAMS THAT HELP FAMILY CARE GIVERS. THOUGHT CUTS OF OVER 75% BACK DURING THE RECESSION IN THE MONEY HAS NOT BEEN RESTORED. HE BELIEVES WE CAN KEEP DOING THINGS THE SAME WAY. NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THESE HIGH COSTS BUT BECAUSE WE ARE APPROACHING THE POINT WHERE THERE WILL BE AS MANY PEOPLE OVER SIXTEEN AS UNDER NINETEEN THAT COMES UP IN. SIX YEARS. END AN EARLIER STUDY BY A. R. P. ALSO FOUND. THAT A RATIO OF PAID AND UNPAID OR INFORMAL CARE GIVERS WENT WELL DECLINE PRECIPITOUSLY IT WAS ABOUT SEVEN TO ONE IN. TWENTY TEN BEFORE TO ONE IN. TWENTY THIRTY AND THREE TO ONE BY. TWENTY FIFTY SOME OF THIS COULD BE BECAUSE FOLKS ARE HAVING SMALLER FAMILIES WE ALSO KNOW FROM SOME OF OUR OWN DATA THAT LIVING ALONE SO. PEOPLE DON'T HAVE CARE GIVERS WE CAN'T KEEP. EXPECTING IT TO BE A FAMILY CARE GIVER THAT IN ADDITION A SMALLER FAMILIES OF COURSE THE GROWING. POPULATION OF OLDER CALIFORNIANS GROWING NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES ALONG WITH OTHER PHYSICAL AND COGNITIVE DISABILITIES ARE REALLY LEAVING US AT A POINT IN TIME WERE NOW IS THE TIME TO ACT. SO WE WE WANT TO ALL WRAP OUR ARMS AROUND THIS TOGETHER. HOW ARE WE GOING TO GO FORWARD WE BELIEVE IT'S NOT WE CANNOT WAIT ANY LONGER -- WE MUST ACT NOW -- AS KEVIN NOTED A OR P. -- IS A BIG SUPPORTER OF SB FIVE TWELVE INTRODUCED BY SENATOR PAN WHICH WOULD HELP. TO CREATE A LONG AN L. TSS SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. BUT WERE ALSO LOOKING A LEGISLATION TO EXPAND PAID FAMILY LEAVE FOR FAMILY CAREGIVERS. TO EXPANDED SO THE MORE FOLKS HAVE JOB PROTECTIONS. WAGE REPLACEMENT IS HIGHER FUNDING FOR A CARE GIVER RESOURCE CENTERS AND REALLY I'M LOOKING AT A COHESIVE HOLISTIC. MASTER PLAN ON AGING SOARED JUST. TO DOES THE CAP OFF FOREVER OR MARKS WERE DOT IT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE REALLY CANNOT WAIT ANYMORE WE MUST GO FORWARD. TAKE BOLD ACTION AND I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR HAVING THE SHIRT TODAY [inaudible] FOR GOOD AFTERNOON I'M HAD LONG TIME ACTING DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF AGING SO LONG TERM CARE. AN AGING SERVICES DIVISION WHICH IS THE PROGRAM SIDE OF OUR DEPARTMENT -- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY AND TO GIVE YOU A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO OUR PROGRAM THAT'S MOST FOCUSED ON K. FAMILY CARE GIVERS WHICH IS THE FAMILY CARE GIVER SUPPORT PROGRAM UNDER TITLE THREE EASY OF THE OLDER AMERICANS ACT -- THE FEDERAL OLDER AMERICANS. TWO THOUSAND ESTABLISHED TITLE THREE E. THE NATIONAL FAMILY CAREGIVER SUPPORTPROGRAM WHICH FOCUSED ON HELPING FAMILIES TO PROVIDE CARE FOR RELATIVES AT HOME. THE PROGRAM PROVIDES GRANTS TO STATES AND TERRITORIES BASED ON THEIR SHARE OF THE TOTAL POPULATION OF THE NATION'S POPULATION OF PEOPLE SEVENTY AND OLDER -- CALIFORNIA'S FEDERAL FISCAL YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN FAMILY CAREGIVER SUPPORT PROGRAM FUNDING -- IS A LITTLE OVER. EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS EIGHTEEN POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. THE FEDERAL SHARE OF THE FAMILY CARE GIVER SUPPORT PROGRAM FUNDING. OF MAY NOT EXCEED 75% OF CALIFORNIA'S TOTAL FAMILY CAREGIVER SUPPORT PROGRAM COSTS. THE NON FEDERAL SHARE MUST BE AT LEAST 25% OF STATE PROGRAM COSTS. THE CALIFORNIA WORKS WITH A NETWORK OF THIRTY THREE AREA AGENCIES ON AGING TO DELIVER. SERVICES TO OLDER CALIFORNIANS AND THEIR FAMILIES THROUGHOUT THE FIFTY EIGHT CALIFORNIA COUNTIES AND THE LOCAL AREA AGENCIES ON AGING PROVIDE THE NON FEDERAL MATCH. WITH THE LOCAL FUNDING OR IN KIND CONTRIBUTIONS. NO STATE GENERAL FUND DOLLARS ARE ALLOCATED TO CALIFORNIA'S FAMILY CAREGIVER SUPPORT PROGRAM -- FAMILY CAREGIVER SUPPORT PROGRAM SERVICES SUPPORT FAMILY AN INFORMAL CARE GIVERS AND HELP OLDER ADULTS TO REMAIN IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. THE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO EMPOWER CARE GIVERS. REDUCE CARE GIVER BURDEN. ENABLE CARE GIVERS TO REMAIN IN THE WORK FORCE PRESERVE AND PROMOTE UNPAID. FAMILY CARE GIVER NETWORKS AND PREVENTS FOR DELAY. THE CARE RECEIVERS NEED FOR HIGHER LEVELS OF CARE. THE FIVE PROGRAM SERVICE CATEGORIES ARE INFORMATION FOR CARE GIVERS ABOUT THE AVAILABLE SERVICES. ASSISTANCE TO CARE GIVERS IN GAINING ACCESS TO SERVICES. SO SORT THE SUPPORT SERVICES LIKE INDIVIDUAL COUNSELING. SUPPORT GROUPS AND CARE GIVER TRAINING TO ASSIST CARE GIVERS AND MAKING DECISIONS. AND SOLVING. PROBLEMS ARISING FROM CARE GIVING. RESPITE CARE TO RELIEVE CARE GIVERS TEMPORARILY FROM THERE CAN FOR CAREGIVING RESPONSIBILITIES. AND THE LIMITED SUPPLEMENTAL SERVICES THAT ADDRESS UNIQUE NEEDS THAT THREATEN THE CARE GIVERS ABILITY TO CONTINUE PROVIDING CARE FOR EXAMPLE -- INSTALLING SAFETY RAILS AND GRAB BARS. PURCHASING ASSISTIVE DEVICES. AND PURCHASING OTHER SERVICES THAT MAY BE UNIQUELY ADDRESS THE CARE GIVERS NEED TO PROVIDE SERVICE. THE OLDER AMERICANS ACT REQUIRES THAT EACH TRIPLE A ENSURE THAT ALL FIVE SERVICE CATEGORIES ARE. OFFERED IN ITS ITS PARTICULAR PLANNING IN SERVICE AREA EITHER AS DIRECT SERVICES. OR THROUGH SUBCONTRACTS OR PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER PUBLIC OR PRIVATE AGENCIES. THE OLDER AMERICANS ACT AS RE AUTHORIZED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SPECIFIED THE FOLLOWING POPULATIONS BEING ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE SERVICES. ADULT FAMILY MEMBERS OR OTHER INFORMAL CARE GIVERS TO PROVIDE CARE TO PEOPLE OVER. SIXTY OR PEOPLE WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND RELATED DISORDERS OF ANY AGE. RELATIVES OVER FIFTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE THAT ARE NOT PARENTS. WHO ARE CARING FOR CHILDREN UNDER? EIGHTEEN AND THE OTHER WHERE RELATIVES INCLUDING PARENTS WHO CARE FOR A PERSON OF ANY AGE WITH DISABILITIES. IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN CALIFORNIA'S FAMILY CAREGIVER SUPPORT PROGRAM SERVED ABOUT FOURTEEN THOUSAND CARE GIVERS. OF OLDER ADULTS WERE ADULTS WITH DEMENTIA AND RELATED DISORDERS. THE TYPICAL CARE GIVERS SERVED WERE WE IN THE AGES OF SIXTY AND SEVENTY FOUR THE PROGRAM ALSO SERVED ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY CARE GIVERS GIVERS OF CHILDREN. OR CARE GIVERS OF AN INDIVIDUAL WITH A DISABILITY. THE TYPICAL CARE GIVERS SERVED IN THAT PROGRAM WERE ALSO WOMEN. BETWEEN THE AGES OF FIFTY FIVE AND SEVENTY FOUR THANK YOU THANK YOU. I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AT THE MOMENT BUT OFFERING ARE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FIFTY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE PANEL. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- ACTUALLY -- SO LONG -- I APPRECIATE THE THE WORK OF OUR AGING -- AGING AGENCIES AND OUR DEPARTMENT AGING -- BUT I ALSO AM STRUCK AS YOU TALKED ABOUT THE SIZE OF YOUR BUDGET. AND THINKING ABOUT THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM IS YOUR BEEN. A AND THE AND AT THE MADE REFERENCE -- A DAY AND SOME OF THE FINANCING THINGS FOR A LONG TERM -- SERVICES AND SUPPORT BUT IN TERMS OF MAY THE SERVICES YOU'RE FOR TO THAT -- THAT -- YOUR AGENCY IN THE AREA AGENCIES ON AGING ARE PROVIDING -- WHAT PORTION OF THE NEEDS ARE YOU ACTUALLY ABLE TO SERVE WITH THE RESOURCES YOU HAVE I MEAN IT'S IT'S THE AGENCIES TO DATE? MANAGE THEIR DOING GREAT WORK ABOUT I'M JUST -- I ALSO WONDER ABOUT SCALE OKAY MIRROR. HI I THINK AN ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WHAT WHAT YOU FIND WITH THE NATIONAL FAMILY CAREGIVER SUPPORT PROGRAM OVERALL IS THAT IT. IT TOUCHES ON A SMALL PORTION OF THE NEED I CAN'T GIVE YOU AN EXACT PER PERCENTAGE. BUT IT'S IT'S CERTAINLY GIVEN THE TESTIMONY WE'VE HEARD TODAY AND AND THE DOCUMENT THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED. THERE IS NEED TO BE BEYOND WHAT IS. IT AND WHAT EFFORTS AND I KNOW THIS IS A NEW ADMINISTRATION BUT HAVE BEEN DONE TO TRY TO AT LEAST TO FIND WHAT THE I'D SAY IS THEN -- DOMINATOR WHAT IS THE ACTUALLY WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE NEED WE ARE PROVIDING I KNOW THAT -- THE GOVERNOR BROWN RECEDING GOVERNOR DID SIGN. IN THE LAST STATE BUDGET FOR A STUDY THAT YES -- LEASE SOME OF THIS BUT THE T. SPEAK TO ANY OTHER EFFORTS TO TRY TO ACTUALLY THE FINE SO YOU CAN GET. YOUR HOPEFULLY HAVE SOME DATA ABOUT WHO YOU'RE ACTUALLY ABLE TO TOUCH CURRENTLY -- BUT THEN -- TO TRY TO HAVE A BETTER ASSESSMENT OF HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU ACTUALLY SHOULD BE TOUCHING I MEAN ARE THE BUT THEN PUT DEMAND IS OUT THERE TO YOU CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT. I I'M I'M. I THOUGHT. THAT WAS AS OAKS ARE I'M NOT PREPARED TO SPEAK TO THAT AT THIS TIME I DIDN'T COME UP WITH THAT AND I HAVE I MUST SAY I'VE BEEN AND I AM THE ACTING DEPUTY DIRECTOR I'VE BEEN AWAY FOR A FEW YEARS. AND I'VE -- I'M BACK TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT FOR A COUPLE MONTHS. BY APPRECIATE THAT -- YOU'RE BACK IN YOUR HELPING OUT -- PERHAPS -- AND WHETHER IT'S YOURSELF OR SOMEONE ELSE -- THE CHAIR HERE AND I AM BOTH SERVE ON OUR BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE AND I THINK SHE CAN SPEAK FOR HERSELF TO BUT I WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED IN HAVING ANSWER THAT QUESTION BY THE TIME. THIS ISSUE COMES UP BEFORE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE AS WELL. THANK YOU [inaudible] THE AREA AGENCIES ON AGING. DUE TO LOCAL NEEDS ASSESSMENT. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- I'M NOT. AS I CAN SAY CONVERSANT RIGHT NOW AND WHAT AREA AGENCIES ON AGING HAVE DONE WITH REGARDS TO THEIR LOCAL NEEDS ASSESSMENT IN THIS AREA BUT THAT THE LOCAL LEVEL. I THINK AREA AGENCIES OF MAYBE CLOSER TO A DETERMINATION OF WHAT NEEDS ARE IN THEIR AREA YOU'RE WELCOME. THANK YOU CENTER BANNER I DO WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] OKAY. GRATEFUL THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY OF GREAT INFORMATION TO KNOW AND WE APPRECIATE THE HARD WORK AND DEDICATION -- YOU BRING TO THE ISSUE. NEXT WILL CALL OUR SECOND PANEL SO THAT. WE CAN LEARN ABOUT THE CARE GIVER NEEDS AN IMPACTS OF CARE GIVING. ONCE AGAIN WE WILL SET A TIME LIMIT FOR PANELIST AT FIVE TO SEVEN MINUTES EACH AND THEN OPEN FOR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I'D LIKE TO ASK PANELIST INTRODUCE THEMSELVES AT THE BEGINNING OF THEIR TESTIMONY. THAT DR BENTON PLEASE START WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. AND WE CAN ALSO HAVE BETSY BUT FOR AND BEVERLY AND BARBARA. AS WELL. THANK YOU. FOR YOU'VE HEARD FROM UP A REALLY HEARD A LOT OF THE STATISTICS ARE NOT GONNA BE GOING OVER THE STATISTICS AGAIN. MY NAME IS DONNA BEEN TEN I'M AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. I ALSO AND THE DIRECTOR OF A ONE OF THE ELEVEN CARE GIVER RESOURCE CENTERS A. GALLUP. IN CALIFORNIA AND SO TODAY I'M GONNA BE FOCUSING MY REMARKS AND FOR ISSUES THAT ARE REALLY WHAT I CONSIDER GAPS IN WHAT WE'VE NOTICES GAPS IN SERVICES. FOR FAMILY CAREGIVERS AND TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION WE HAVE ONE OUT OF ONE OUT OF EVERY FOUR HOUSEHOLDS HAVE FAMILY CARE GIVERS AND WILK CERTAINLY WE ARE NOT REACHING THAT WERE PROBABLY REACHING MORE LIKE 122%. OF THOSE HOUSEHOLDS WE YOU KNOW WE OFTEN HEAR ABOUT THE NEED TO ADDRESS DIVERSITY. AND WHEN DEVELOPING POLICIES AND PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA. IN GENERAL WHEN PEOPLE THINK OF DIVERSITY THIS DISCUSSION TENDS TO FOCUS ON RACE AND ETHNICITY. TODAY WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS KIND OF EXPAND YOUR DEFINITION. WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FAMILY CARE GIVING? BECAUSE WINDOWS DIVRSITY WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE WHEN WE APPLY IT TO FAMILY CARE GIVERS AND IT'S GOING TO BE MUCH BROADER IN SCOPE. WHEN WE ARE LOOKING AT FAMILY CARE GIVING AND DIVERSITY? FOR THIS POPULATION WE HAVE TO BE -- REALLY HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF DIVERSITY WHICH INCLUDES NOT JUST RACE AND ETHNICITY. BUT ALSO PREFERENCES SUCH AS CULTURAL PREFERENCES FOR FAMILY CARE GIVERS AND HOW THEY WANT TO BE. PRESENTED WITH SERVICES WHERE THEY WANT TO ACCESS SERVICES AND WHEN THEY WANT TO ACCESS SERVICES. THERE CERTAINLY IS DIVERSITY BROKE -- AMONG H.. CARE GIVERS RANGE FROM A FOR OUR GROUP EIGHTEEN AND UP. AND WE SEE DIFFERENT GENERATIONS. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE TEND TO EAT FOR AND THEY'RE ALL CARING FOR OLDER ADULTS. BUT IF YOU HAVE A THIRTY SIX YEAR OLD THE WORKING. AND CARING FOR THEIR FAMILY MEMBER THEIR NEEDS ARE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT THAN THE EIGHTY SIX YEAR OLD WHO'S CARING FOR THEIR SPOUSE. BUT HOW DO WE GO ABOUT UNDERSTANDING WHY HOW THEIR SIMILAR. AND SO ONE OF THE FIRST GAPS I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS A NEED FOR ACE OF GOOD STANDARDIZED ASSESSMENT TOOL. WHAT WE DON'T HAVE -- CONSISTENTLY EXCEPT TO LOOK ONE A COUPLE OF SYSTEMS IS A STANDARDIZED ASSESSMENT TOOL THAT IT DOES A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT FOR FAMILY CAREGIVERS. WE NEED TO HAVE A SIMILAR LEVEL OF LIKE THE MINIMUM DATA SET OF INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE ANOTHER SYSTEMS. SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT'S A PERSON'S EMPLOYMENT STATUS -- HOW DOES GENDER GENDER IDENTITY IMPACT THEIR FAMILY CARE GIVING OUT IS INCOME IMPACT FAMILY CARE GIVING? WHAT'S THE CARE RECIPIENTS AND THE CARE RECEIVERS HEALTH STATUS. WE'RE OFTEN ASK IS CARE GIVERS TO ALL COULD YOU COULD GO HOME TAKE CARE OF YOUR HUSBAND BUT HAS ANYONE ASKED THE CARE GIVER ABOUT THEIR BACK PROBLEMS. THEIR SLEEPING HABITS. THINGS LIKE THAT. WE NEED MENTAL AND PHYSICAL CONCERNS OF THE CARE GIVER WHAT'S THEIR MENTAL HEALTH LIKE AND WHAT KIND OF SOCIAL SUPPORT DO THEY HAVE. WHEN THEY START THEIR CARE GIVING JOURNEY? BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO BE QUITE A LOT OF THE TIME THAT THEY WILL BE PROVIDING CARE ON AVERAGE ABOUT FOUR YEARS. WE NEED A SYSTEM. THROUGH THIS ASSESSMENT THAT HAS THAT FLEXIBILITY SO THAT. GET A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT'S THE SAME BUT THEN THAT ALLOWS YOU TO INDIVIDUALIZE YOUR CARE AND TREATMENT PLANNING FOR THE FAMILY CAREGIVER SO THE A ONE BIG GAP IS HAVING. CONSISTENT INFORMATION FROM OUR CARE GIVERS THAT ACROSS ALL OF OUR SYSTEMS. THE OTHER THING WE WANT TO LOOK AT I WITH THE SECOND THING IS THE NEXT GAP IS FOR FAMILY CARE GIVERS IS TO WAY OF IMPROVING CARE GIVER STRESS. THROUGH EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS. NOW THERE OF SOME EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS THAT ARE OUT THERE. THAT ARE FOR FAMILY CAREGIVERS BUT WHAT WE FIND IS WHEN IT COMES TO THE COMMUNITY LEVEL THESE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN TESTED IN IDEAL SITUATIONS. MAY NOT TRANSLATE INTO THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE THEY MAY. REQUIRE OF THE MAY ONLY BE IN ENGLISH. IT MAY REQUIRE SIX OR SEVEN TIMES TO COME TO THE PROGRAM BUT WHO'S GOING TO PAY FOR THEM TO TAKE A BREAK AND BE AT HOME AND WHERE'S THE RESPITE CARE FOR THAT -- MAYBE AND SOMETIMES THE FUNDING DOESN'T ALLOW FOR IT THE A AGENCIES TO ACTUALLY BE REIMBURSED BECAUSE YOU NEED TO TRAINERS. AND THEY'RE SAYING WELL WE'RE ONLY GONNA PAY FOR ONE PERSON TO DO THE TRAINNG BUT THE MODEL THE EVIDENCE BASED. THAT HAS LINKED TO OUTCOMES. REQUIRES TWO TRAINERS AT THE SAME TIME IN THE CITY -- NO WE'RE ONLY GOING TO GIVE YOU TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS TO DO THIS PROGRAM. THAT'S IT. WOULDN'T THAT IS A MAJOR GAP AND WE NEED TO HAVE POLICIES THAT ALLOW FOR THAT TYPE OF FLEXIBILITY -- THE OTHER THE THIRD THING I WANT YOU TO THINK AROUND GAPS IS I MENTIONED EMPLOYMENT AS A TYPE OF DIVERSITY FOR FAMILY CAREGIVERS. AND GET AS YOU HEARD BEFORE WE HAVE ABOUT 60% OF CARE GIVERS WHO WERE IN THE WORKPLACE. BUT WHAT WE DON'T HAVE A CONSISTENT POLICIES THAT -- ARE. HELP PROTECT FAMILY CARE GIVERS WE HEAR STORIES OF CARE GIVERS WHO KNOW THAT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO MAYBE TAKE OFF MORE TIME THERE'S AND JOB PROTECTION. AND THEY ALSO SOMETIMES FEEL DISCRIMINATED AGAINST ONE SOMEBODY HEARS THAT THEY ARE FAMILY CARE GIVER SO THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT THEIR CARE GIVING -- AND WE KNOW THE CARE GIVERS ARE READY DON'T SELF IDENTIFIED BUT NOW THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY CAN EVEN MENTION IT TO AN EMPLOYER. BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT HAVE ANY TYPE OF PROTECTION. AND AT THE SAME TIME AS FAR AS EMPLOYMENT. OUR CARE GIVERS NEED TO HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY SO THAT. DEPENDING ON WHEN YOU'RE WORKING THE SUPPORT SERVICES NEED TO BE ABLE TO BE ONLINE AND PROVIDE SOME OF THE TRAINING AND EDUCATION. THAT FILTERED INDIVIDUALLY THAT COMES OUT OF THAT GREAT ASSESSMENT THAT YOU MAY HAVE -- THAT ALLOWS THEM TO HAVE THAT INDIVIDUAL TIME WHEN THEY CAN DO IT WHICH MIGHT BE IT TEN AT NIGHT. MIGHT BE EIGHT IN THE MORNING BUT NOT THE NORM NOT THE NINE TO FIVE FINALLY WE KNOW THE CARE GIVING IS A JOURNEY. AND BECAUSE OF THIS WE REALLY. IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE SUPPORT. FROM TIME FOR RESPITE FOR FAMILY CAREGIVERS. THERE IS A CRITICAL SHORTAGE OF FUNDING FOR RESPITE. THERE WE CERTAINLY HAVE RESTED COMING IN THROUGH SOME OF THE THREE E. PROGRAMS BUT IT'S YES IT IS NOT ENOUGH THE LIST ARE EXTREMELY LONG. FOR CARE GIVERS WHO NEED A BREAK IF YOU COULD A MATCH YOUR LIFE GOING. FOR THREE FOUR OR MORE YEARS WITHOUT EVER HAVING A VACATION. WITHOUT EVER BEING ABLE TO TAKE A DEEP BREATH ARE HAVE A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP. THAT'S ALL THEY'RE ASKING FOR THEY'RE NOT ASKING FOR A FULL TIME REPLACEMENT. FAMILIES THEY WANT TO BE THERE FOR THEIR FAMILY MEMBER. BUT YOU KNOW IT WOULD BE NICE TO BE ABLE TO GO AWAY FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS OR SLEEP. OVERNIGHT SOMETHING SOME TYPE OF RESPITE. SO WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO GIVE THE ABILITY FOR FAMILY MEMBERS AND THAT'S A BIG GAP. AT THE OTHER THING IS PULSE CARE GIVING. WE DON'T OFTEN THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THE CARE GIVER AFTER THE PERSON AT THE BEEN CARING FOR PASSES AWAY AND SO SOME OF OUR SYSTEMS MOST OF THE END. ON THE DAY THAT THE PERSON STOPS BEING A CARE GIVER BUT HOSPICE HAS A GREAT MODEL WHERE AT LEAST YOU CAN. CONTINUE TO TALK TO THE FAMILY MEMBERS. POST CARE GIVING FOR UP TO A YEAR WITH SOME GRIEF COUNSELING MAYBE JUST HELPING THEM TANSITION BACK INTO. THAT WORLD AGAIN BECAUSE THEY HAVE BECOME SO ISOLATED -- SO I JUST I THINK THAT'S ADMINISTAFF MY REMARKS THERE I THINK I'VE USED UP MY FIVE MINUTES. AND ALLOWED PASADENA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LISTENING. THANK YOU CHAIR AND ESTEEMED COMMITTEE -- FOR FOCUSING ON THIS ISSUE IT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT AND SO DELIGHTED AND HONORED TO BE HERE WITH YOU TODAY -- I AM THE BETSY BUTLER I AM THE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON AGING I'M ALSO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S LAW CENTER. AND AS A LONG DISTANCE CAREGIVER AN ADVOCATE FOR WOMEN'S ISSUES -- INCLUDE ECONOMIC SECURITY. THIS TOPIC RESONATES WITH ME -- QUITE PERSONALLY AND I'M GONNA QUICKLY -- STORY ABOUT MY MY FAMILY MY PARENTS AND MY FATHER AND HIS BATTLE. WITH ALZHEIMER'S BUT I MISS START OFF BY SAYING THAT. AT THE MOMENT THAT MY FATHER WAS DIAGNOSED I WAS AFRAID IT WAS GOING TO KILL MY MOTHER AS WELL BECAUSE I KNEW CARE GIVING -- IS IS A TWENTY FOUR SEVEN THING AND IF IT GETS WORSE -- SO I WAS VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT HER HEALTH -- FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. SO I WAS BORN REYES TURNS ARGUMENT ON MY PARENTS LIVED HERE MY MOM STILL LIVES HERE MY MOM IS -- A SPUNKY NINETY TWO GOING ON SEVENTY REALLY LUCKY TO HAVE THAT -- REALLY. PART PROUD OF THE FACT THAT -- SHE IS SUCH A STRONG WOMAN AND BEING IS BEING SO STRONG SHE WAS ALWAYS VERY PRIVATE ABOUT THIS SHE DIDN'T WANT. TO TELL FRIENDS AND FAMILY -- SHE WHAT WAS ACTUALLY HAPPENING IN THE HOUSEHOLD BECAUSE AGAIN -- MY FATHER PASSED AWAY THREE WEEKS BEFORE THEIR FIFTIETH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY SO. SHE WAS VERY PRIVATE AND MY DAD MY DAD WAS DIAGNOSED WITH ALZHEIMER'S AT THE AGE OF SIXTY SEVEN AND HAD IT FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS. SO MY MOTHER WAS HIS CARE GIVER FOR FOURTEEN YEARS -- SHE SHE HE PASSED AWAY WHEN SHE WAS EIGHTY FIVE SHE IS TOLD SHE WAS TWO YEARS OLDER THAN HIM. SO ALL OF THE EFFORT THAT YOU PUT AND SHE WAS AN ACTUALLY OLDER WOMAN THAN THAN MY FATHER -- ABOUT FIVE YEARS INTO MY FATHER'S DIAGNOSIS MY MOTHER DID QUIT HER JOB AND BECAME AN UNPAID FULL TIME CARE GIVER -- WHICH MEANT THAT AGAIN MY FOR MY MOTHER WAS A CARE GIVER ALL THROUGH ER SEVENTIES AND INTO THAT FIRST HALF OF HER EIGHTIES -- AND AS MUCH AS MY FATHER'S CARE. AGREE MORE BURDENSOME AND DEMANDING MY MOTHER AGAIN THOUGHT VERY RESPONSIBLE FOR HIM AND WOULD NOT GO OUTSIDE. THE HOME FOR ANY HELP -- AS THE DISEASE PROGRESSED HE WAS UNABLE TO DO MANY THINGS FOR HIMSELF. HE ALSO BEGAN TO HAVE VERY IRREGULAR SLEEPING PATTERN SOMEBODY'S LITERALLY BE UP FOR A FEW MINUTES EVERY HOUR OF EVERY DAY AND SO THAT MEANT THAT MY MOTHER COULD NEVER HAVE TIME OUT OF HER SIGHT. SHE COULD NEVER LEAVE HIM ALONE -- AND THANKFULLY SHE FOUND ADULT ADULT DAY SERVICES AND I BELIEVE THAT WITHOUT ADULT A SERVICES MY FATHER'S DISEASE WOULD HAVE KILLED HER BECAUSE INITIALLY SHE TOOK HIM -- AND TO THE DON'T THEY SERVICES FOR ABOUT FIVE HOURS EVERY COUPLE OF DAYS BUT BY THE END IT WAS. IT WAS A GOOD EIGHT HOURS FIVE DAYS A WEEK AND OFTEN MY MOM WOULD JUST GO HOME AND SLEEP SOMETIME SHOULD RUN ERRANDS. SHOULD EVEN GET CURVES AND SHOULD DO A LITTLE WORK OUT BY COMMENT TO SLEEP -- SHE SHE ULTIMATELY WHEN AN ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS WHERE SHE WAS IN SUCH BAD SHAPE THEY LITERALLY SAID WE'RE GOING TO KEEP YOUR DAD FOR A WEEK BECAUSE THEY COULD JUST LOOK AT HER AND KNOW THAT SHE WAS. SHE WAS SPENT SHE WAS GONE AND GETTING THE ISOLATION IS JUST. EXHAUSTING -- TO SO -- I LIVED IN LOS ANGELES DURING THIS TIME I CAME UP AS MUCH AS I COULD -- AGAIN MOM NOT BEING WELL HONEST WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE HOUSEHOLD AS A FAMILY WE HAD DECIDED IN AGREED THAT AS SOON AS MY FATHER'S HYGIENE WENT -- BUT HE WE WOULD LOOK AT PERMANENT. A NURSING HOME CARE FOR HIM MY MOM DID NOT TELL US THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING FOR A GOOD TWO YEARS SO MY FATHER WAS HAVING MASSIVE TOILETING PROBLEMS. FOR QUITE SOME TIME -- HE WAS HAVING EMOTIONAL OUTBURST -- HE HE WASN'T A WALKER MEANING HE NEVER WALKED OUT THE FRONT DOOR AND LEFT THE HOUSE BUT WE NEVER KNEW IF HE WAS GOING -- TO SHE CARRIED ALL THESE BURDENS ON HER OWN -- AND AGAIN AS I SAID SHE WAS TWO YEARS OLDER THAN THAN HE WAS -- SO MY DAD SPENT THE LAST TWO YEARS OF HIS LIFE FOR RIFIC OF MY FATHER'S NURSING HOME STAY WITH THAT WE COULD DO A WHOLE NOTHER -- A HEARING ON THAT -- MY FATHER'S NURSING HOMES DAVIS WAS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE WHICH ADDED EVEN MORE GUILT AND PRESSURE ON TO MY MOTHER BECAUSE AS MUCH AS YOU WANT TO MOVE N TO A NEW BETTER PLACE ALZHEIMER'S PATIENTS ON MY TO BE MOVED BUT THEN AGAIN ALSO. SOMEBODY THESE PLACES ARE SO SIMILAR AND THEIR LACK OF GOOD CARE -- ALSO THIS CARE AND IT WAS HERE IN SACRAMENTO IN TWENTY ELEVEN WAS SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH. EVEN THOUGH MY MOTHER HAD PURCHASED SOME FORM OF LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE DECADES BEFORE NONE OF IT COVERED THIS -- THE IN THE ADULT DAY SERVICES CARE ALSO NOT COVERED -- AND THIS WAS THE ONLY WAS MY PARENTS WERE ACTUALLY ABLE TO AFFORD IT WAS BECAUSE BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM THEY HAD. FOR PENSIONS MEMBER PENSIONS PEOPLE -- ANYWAY THEY HAD FOR PENSIONS AND AND THIS CARE IS VERY EXPENSIVE BUT MY MY FAMIL WAS ABLE TO COVER IT BECAUSE OF THE PENSIONS. THEY HAD SO -- WITH THAT -- MY MOM. WASN'T TRAINED IN ANYWAY CHAU TO LEARN ALL THIS ON OUR OWN SHE DISCUSSED BUT ALSO JUST WASN'T A LOT. THERE. THOUGH -- I WANNA REALLY AGAIN THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR DOING THIS AND AND UNDERSCORE THOUGH A COUPLE THINGS ABOUT -- ABOUT -- CARE GIVING PARTICULARLY AS IT APPLIES TO WOMEN AND I WANNA ALSO -- REALLY. APPRECIATE AND THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR PUTTING TOGETHER THE GREAT BACKGROUND PAPER WAS REALLY REALLY HELPFUL IN. AND OUR OUR REITERATE SOME OF IT BECAUSE T IS THAT IMPORTANT SO AS MENTIONED CARE OF IT GIVING IS DECIDEDLY A WOMEN'S ISSUE. AVERAGE AGE OF AN INFORMAL CARE GIVERS -- SEVENTY FIVE OR OLDER 85% OF THE CARE IS PROVIDED -- FOR A FAMILY MEMBER. THE AVERAGE DURATION AS AND ON HAVE MENTIONED IS FOUR YEARS -- IN A PARK APPROXIMATELY 20% PRIDE 25% OF THE CARE GIVERS HAVE PROVIDED CARE FOR FIVE YEARS OR MORE -- CARE GIVING COMES AT A AT A REALLY HUGE COSTS AS A MISTER PEDOPHILE MENTIONED -- CARE GIVERS IS APPROXIMATELY SIX HUNDRED IF A LIFETIME. DUE TO LOST PAY INCREASES REDUCED RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTIONS LOWER SAVINGS. LOWER SO SECURITY EARNINGS AND REDUCED ABILITY TO MAINTAIN HOME HOME UPKEEP -- ALSO WANNA WANT TO POINT OUT THAT AS WOMEN SINCE WERE NEVER PAID WHAT WERE WORTH ITS WERE STILL. LACKING IN THAT AND THE NEW DYNAMIC OF OF WOMEN SUCH AS MYSELF WHO HAVE NEVER MARRIED AND DON'T HAVE CHILDREN -- A LOT OF WOMEN OUT THERE I I THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS WILL BE TAKING CARE OF ONE ANOTHER BUT THAT'S ANOTHER DYNAMIC TO THIS -- NOT HOW I DON'T HAVE A BIG FAMILY I I DIDN'T HAVE A FAMILY SO. THAT'S ANOTHER -- MAJOR CONCERN AND SINGLE WOMEN WHOCARE FOR ELDERLY PARENTS OR TWO POINT FIVE TIMES MORE LIKELY. A TO BE IMPOVERISHED WHEN THEY ARE OLDER SO THE POVERTY -- KEEPS. KEEPS GROWING AND AGAIN I JUST WANT TO UNDERSCORE UNDERSCORE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT YOU ALL ARE. MAKING A DECISION I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME VERY VERY MUCH THIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY -- AND TO SHARE OUR EXPERIENCES A ANA WITH CARE GIVING -- I'M. I'VE CARED FOR MULTIPLE FAMILY MEMBERS AND THROUGHOUT MY LIFE AND I'M A VOLUNTEER WITH THE A A RP. BUT I'D LIKE TO SHARE MY PERSONAL STORY AND MY NAME IS BEVERLY I WAS ORPHANED AT A YOUNG AGE MY FATHER WHEN I WAS SEVEN AND MY MOM WHEN I WAS -- ELEVEN AND IN SPITE OF THE DIFFICULTIES OF FOR CARRYING. FOR OTHER RELATIVES. AND PARENTS -- I HAD. DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES WITH CARING FOR FAMILY AND SPECIFICALLY MY GRANDMOTHER WHEN I WAS JUST A YOUNG GIRL BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T SPEAK ENGLISH. BUT HER HEALTH WAS ALREADY NOT WELL BUT SHE WOULDN'T LET ANYBODY KNOW. AND AS I GOT OLDER WILL I'D LIKE TO SHARE JUST A COUPLE OF TIMES THAT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO HELP. MY IN LAWS -- MY FATHER WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER IN THE IN THE EIGHTIES WHEN WE LIVED HERE IN SACRAMENTO WERE ORIGINALLY FROM THE MODERATE AREA MY HUSBAND AND I SO OUR FAMILIES ARE THERE. SO -- LOCALLY I WORK IN A HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT WOULD HELP. GET MY IN LAWS ON THEIR HIVE PLAN. AND DURING HIS ILLNESS ON MY MOTHER LOVE BUT FORGET TO PAY THE PAY PREMIUMS SO WE WOULD COVER THE PREMIUMS. COPAYS FOR THE PHARMACEUTICALS THAT WOULD NEED WERE NEEDED. ON MY HEAD HUSBAND HAD IS OFF ALL AND HE CLOSED IT SO HE COULD WORK OUT OF THE HOUSE. SO THEY COULD STAY THERE DURING THE DAY WHILE I'VE WORKED FULL TIME -- AND IT WASN'T A FAMILY FRIENDLY ENVIRONMENT THERE WAS NO. FMLA OR ANYTHING -- I HAD KIDS THAT WERE IN SCHOOLS SO. I WORKED FULL TIME. I DIDN'T SHARE A LOT AT WORK. AND CAME HOME AND PREPARED MEALS FOR FOR THE FOR ALL OF US. IN NATURE MY OUR KIDS GO TO SCHOOL -- SOMETIMES IF MY MOTHER IN LAW HAD A ISSUE WITH MY FATHER Là SHE WOULD LIKE THE AND SEE WHAT I COULD DO. AND AND MY HUSBAND TO I'M NOT GONNA SAY IT WAS ON ME BECAUSE I WAS MORE OF A BACK UP. ON AND THEN YOU KNOW MAKING SURE OUR KIDS MARKET I OUR DAUGHTER WAS A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL WHEN HE WAS. ACTUALLY TERMINAL AND AND HOSPICE. AND SO THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE YOUR FINE YEAR BUT IT WAS. THERE WAS -- HE PASSED AWAY RIGHT BEFORE HER GRADUATION BUT WE MADE THE BEST OF IT AND TRY TO KEEP OUR SON BUSY -- TO SO WE WERE REALLY DO WHAT IT WAS LIKE OF OUR CULTURE DOESN'T PUT OUR FOR FAMILY MEMBERS AND HOMES. I WOULDN'T HAVE A CLUE UNTIL LATELY ASKING PEOPLE HOW MUCH IT COSTS AND HOW IT WAS. MORE I WAS SHOCKED. BECAUSE WE TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN THAT'S A WE WERE RATIONING GRANDMOTHER TOOK CARE OF ALL OF US. AND SO IN THE RECENT YEARS -- ACTUALLY AFTER MY FATHER Là PASSED AWAY -- AND I WAS WORKING -- ACTUALLY I WAS IN HEALTH CARE WITH MY HUSBAND FATHER IN LAW. WENT AND THEN I RETIRED AND WENT TO VOLUNTEERING GOT HIRED AT THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY. AND THEN MY MOTHER IN LAW WAS DIAGNOSED WITH ALZHEIMER'S. SO SHE WOULD COME FROM MODERATE TO HEAR TO GET HER HEALTH CARE AND SEE HER DOCTORS OR TO GILROY. AND STAY WITH US AND THEN SHE'D GO HOME THE SO WE WERE PREPARED TO TAKE HER AND AND FORGETTING TO PAY THINGS SO WE WERE PAYING FOR HER PREMIUMS AND TRYING TO KEEP OUR HOME GOING. WELL MY HUSBAND WAS SELF EMPLOYED. AND HERE PROVIDING TRANSPORTATION FOOD AND THE FAMILY WOULD COME TO SEE BOTH OF THEM AT DIFFERENT TIMES AND SO WE WERE HOUSING PEOPLE AND FEEDING. AND THEN MOST RECENTLY ONE OF MY FRIENDS WHO WAS MARRIED BUT NEVER HAD CHILDREN -- HER HOW HER HEALTH WAS FAILING AND A SHE'S BEEN REALLY INVOLVED IN ALL OF THESE COMMUNITY SLIGHTLY -- AND HER HUSBAND. WAS HER CARE GIVER THAN HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH LUNG CANCER. AND HER HE INJURED HIMSELF CARING FOR HER SO I WAS TAKING HIM TO THE DOCTOR AND EMERGENCY ROOMS AND HOSPITAL VISITS BECAUSE HE THERE HE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL OR SHE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL HERE. AND HE DIDN'T LAST TO MONTHS AND SO NOW SHE'S DEPRESSED. HE CAN'T TAKE CARE OF HERSELF HE WAS HER CARE GIVER SO I WAS TRYING. TO PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION TO HER AND SOMETIMES BUYING FOOD FOR THE BOTH OF THEM AND THEN HER ALONE. AND THE PICKING UP THE PRESCRIPTIONS FOR THEM ON FOR HER -- SO IT WAS -- IT WAS A IT HAD TO HAPPEN SHE DIDN'T HAVE FAMILY HERE. SO I'VE I'VE TRIED TO DO WHAT I CAN TO HELP THEM AND YOU KNOW THE HOURS INVOLVED I'M RETIRED. AGAIN. ANNAI HAVE FAMILY AND I HAVE MY GRANDKIDS I TOLD MY KIDS AT ON THE GRAND KIDS WOULD BE THE PRIORITY SINCE I WORKED ALL. ALL THEIR LIVES AND I HAD NO PARENTS TO HELP ME. A LIVING IN SACRAMENTO AND NO FAMILY. SO THEY WERE EITHER DAYCARE OR SCHOOL OR WHATEVER WE HAD TO DO -- AND I WANT -- TO THANK YOU FOR THE AT THE ISSUE YOU BROUGHT UP BECAUSE I'M I'VE BEEN INVOLVED AND HEALTH CARE AND I'VE BEEN PUSHING TOWARD CULTURALLY COMPETENT -- ISSUES DRESS ADDRESSING PEOPLE WHO HAVE. HEALTH ISSUES BECAUSE MOST OF OUR CULTURES DON'T COME OUT AND ASK WHAT CAN YOU DO FOR ME. THEY DON'T I MEAN I DIDN'T HAVE A CLUE ABOUT ANY OF THE SERVICES THAT HAPPEN. WE MAY NOT HAVE QUALIFIED I DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT. NOTHING WAS OFFERED. pI HAD NO IDEA. AN HOUR WHEN I WAS AT THE AMERICAN CANCER THEIR WORK WITH DIVERSE COMMUNITIES AND SO AS DIFFERENT AS WE ARE WERE VERY SIMILAR -- YOU KNOW JUST BEING UNDERSTANDING OF WE DO TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN WE DO THE BEST WE CAN AND WE DON'T. TELL EVERYBODY AND I WAS SHOCKED WHEN THEY ASKED ME TO TALK OF HUNT THIS BECAUSE I'D I DIDN'T REALLY TALK ABOUT IT TO EVERYBODY -- I WORK FULL TIME I WORKED ALL MY LIFE AND WE USED TO A LOT OF OUR MONEY TO HELP CARE FOR OUR LOVED ONES. ARE TRIED TO HELP MY FRIENDS WHEN THEY CAN THAT A LOT OF FAMILY MEMBERS THAT I TRIED TO GO ON HEALTH. I'D TAKE A VACATION WEEK TO GO. EITHER TO MONTEREY OR WHATEVER TO SEE WHAT I COULD DO TO RELIEVE EITHER MY BROTHER OR MY COUSIN. WITH THE HEALTH OF THEIR SPOUSE OR FAMILY MEMBER. I YOU KNOW ALL OF THE ISSUES I WAS GOING TO BRING UP WERE PRETTY MUCH ADDRESSED AN INCREASE IN PREMIUMS FOR INSURANCE COPAYS. THE PRESCRIPTIONS ARE OUT OF OUT OF THIS WORLD I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. THE FAMILIES ARE LIVING FURTHER APART AND WITH FEWER CHILDREN ARE NOT CHILDREN. THE COST OF EVERYTHING HAS RISEN NOT JUST HEALTH FOOD UTILITIES I MEAN JUST BUYING. IT SACRAMENTO RENTING A PLACE OF HOUSING IS OFTEN ON AFFORDABLE FOR PEOPLE. AND THE PEOPLE WHO WORKED ALL THEIR LIVES DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO FALL BACK ON THE RECESSION WIPED OUT. A LOT OF PEOPLE. AND YOU DON'T. YOU MAKE MORE THAN WHAT YOU. WHAT QUALIFIES YOU FOR ANY ASSISTANT BUT NOT ENOUGH TO BE SUSTAINABLE AND TO HAVE A HEALTHY LIFE OR TO HAVE SOMEBODY COME IN AND HELP YOU? BECAUSE YOU CAN'T. YOU JUST CAN'T AFFORD IT -- IN -- ONE OF THE LATEST THINGS THAT I'M FINDING. MOST EMPLOYERS ARE HIRING PART TIME PEOPLE WITH NO BENEFITS. SO NOT ONLY DO YOU NOT WANT TO SAY ANYTHING AT WORK BUT YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR BENEFITS THAT YOU CAN TAKE FMLA THAT YOU CAN TAKE VACATION OR SICK LEAVE YOU'RE NOT THERE YOU DON'T GET PAID. THAT IS A HUGE ISSUE WITH SOME OF THESE. AND I'M BRINGING IT UP BECAUSE I HAVE FAMILY FRIENDS AND PEOPLE THAT I WORKED WITH. THAT ARE TAKING CURRENTLY TAKING CARE OF THEIR LOVED ONES. THAT ARE SOMETIMES IN THE SAME SITUATION. I KNOW YOU CAN'T GUARANTEE EVERYTHING. BUT AT THE SAME TIME SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE. ALL RIGHT NOW. I'M A LITTLE UNFOCUSED BECAUSE WE'RE MOVING INTO A TOMORROW OR THURSDAY. AREN'T MY HUSBAND MY SON BOUGHT A HOME AND IT HAS AN IN LAW UNIT BECAUSE WE WILL OUR SON IN LAW. OUR SON AND DAUGHTER IN LAW WERE WE'VE HAD A COMBINED HOME FOR THE PAST MAYBE TEN YEARS. I HELP WITH THE GRAND KIDS HE HAD A HOME BUSINESS AND HE'S WORKING. AND THEN MY HUSBAND STILL WORKING HE NEEDS TO RETIRE. BUT THAT'S WHERE I'M COMING FROM WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF A MOVE SO. HOPEFULLY MADE SENSE. THE CHAIR AND THE OTHER SENATORS HERE TODAY FAIR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU ON BEHALF OF FAMILY CARE GIVERS OF THE OVER SIX HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS LIVING WITH ALZHEIMER'S AND OTHER DEMENTIAS. NAME IS BARBARA MARQUEZ AND I CURRENTLY SERVE AS A BOARD MEMBER FOR THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION CHAPTER. AND I'M HERE TODAY TO SHARE SOME OF THE EXPERIENCES OF MY JOURNEY. AS A CARE GIVER FOR MY MOM FLORENCE MARQUEZ. BUT I'D LIKE TO JUST IF YOU WOULD INDULGE ME JUST REMEMBER I LIKE TO TELL YOU ABOUT MY MOM FOR JUST A MINUTE. TO HONOR HER. SHE WAS BORN IN TEXAS BUT REYES FROM THE AGE OF SEVEN IN THE DEREK HOUGH CALIFORNIA. SHE WAS ONE OF THE TIME TEN SIBLINGS AND FARMWORKERS FAMILY THAT WORKED. VARIOUS CROPS THROUGHOUT THE CENTRAL VALLEY. JOE IS A VERY PROUD OF THE FACT THAT SHE CONTRIBUTED TO FEEDING AMERICA. AFTER SHE MARRIED MY DAD AND MY KIDS IN NINETEEN FIFTY THREE DAVID D. SAN JOSE. WITH ABOUT A SMALL HOUSE IN HIS THEIR FAMILY. SHE WAS A VERY ACTIVE COMMUNITY ORGANIZING DVOCATE FOR THE LARGELY HISPANIC COMMUNITY LIVING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. JAIL MANY NON PROFIT DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION THE BILL TO THIRTY FIVE UNIT AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMPLEX ON SANTEE SAN ANTONIO ACROSS THE STREET FROM MY LADY WHAT A LOSER. IN AREA ONCE CALLED FILL SEQUENCES IT'S THE SAME AREA RECESS OR TRAVIS BEGAN HIS COMMUNITY ORGANIZING IN THE LATE NINETEEN FIFTIES. SHE AND MY DAD SUPPORT ACCESSORIES WORK THROUGHOUT THE YEARS AND OFTEN SPENT TIME WITH HIM ON THE PICKET LINES. IN HONOR FOR MANY YEARS A CLEANING SERVICE SHE WAS IN THIS VERY SAME BUILDING. ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO AND SHE RECEIVED THIS WONDERFUL WORK FROM ONE OF YOUR PREDECESSORS. LEGISLATOR OF THE YEAR AWARD -- THE LATE STATE SENATOR JOHN VASCONCELOS. IT WAS A PROUD MOMENT. FEEL PROBABLY. AND SHE'S THE PROUD CALIFORNIANS. ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO OR SO MY MOTHER RECEIVED A DIAGNOSIS OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. IT WAS DEVASTATING IS. THAT WE ALL BEGAN TO BEAT ABOUT THE DISEASE WE LEARNED A LOT BUT A REALITY WE HAD NO IDEA THAT WE'D BE FACING. ABOUT FIVE YEARS INTO THE DIAGNOSIS IT BECAME QUITE APPARENT TO THE FAMILY THAT SHE COULD NO LONGER LIVE ALONE. IT WAS DECIDED IT WAS BEST FOR HER TO SACRAMENTO TO LIVE WITH ME AND MY HUSBAND. WE ARE EMPTY NESTERS AT THE TIME MY CHILDREN COLLEGE. ALTHOUGH I WAS STILL WORKING FULL TIME. HER HEALTH AND SAFETY BECAME MY PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY. A TWENTY FOUR SEVEN TELL US FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. THAT MUCH TO SHARE ABOUT THIS JOURNEY BUT I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON THREE MAJOR ASPECTS. THE STRUGGLE TO GET THE NECESSARY IF NECESSARY INDICATION TRAINING TO TAKE ON THE RESPONSIBILITY OF CARE GIVING FOR ANOTHER ADULT. THE FINANCIAL COSTS IN THE EMOTIONAL TURMOIL. SO WHEN I GO CREE TO TAKE ON THIS ROLE RECALL THAT IT DIDN'T SEEM ALL HAVE DONE I FAILED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT MY MOTHER'S CONDITION WAS NOT STATIC. IT WOULD DRIVE ME OUT THE CHECK DIGIT DRASTICALLY CHANGE OVER THE COMING WEEKS MONTHS AND YEARS. WORKING MY MOTHER TO THE HOUSE HELD WAS SO DIFFERENT FROM THE DELIBERATE STEPS THAT WE TOOK WHEN HE BROUGHT NEW ADDITIONS TO OUR FAMILY IN THE FORM OF OUR CHILDREN. AT THAT TIME. A BE HANDLED WITH A THERE ISN'T IT GUIDANCE ABANDONED EDUCATION AND TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES IN THE FORM PRENATAL CLASSES PARENTING CLASSES. BOOK FILLED LIBRARY SHELVES. THERE IS ONLINE RESOURCES AND THE LIST WENT ON THERE'S ALSO TYPICALLY A LOT FOR ABUNDANT RESOURCE ADVICE AND SUPPORT FROM FAMILY AND FRIENDS. THEY WOULD TURN INTO US IN TELESERYES OF AND THEY ALSO OFFER CHILDCARE FOOD OTHER SUPPORTIVE WORDS AND ACTIONS. NOTHING LIKE THAT HAPPENED WHEN MOM CAME TO LIVE WITH US. PLAYING FIELD IT FIRSTHAND THE COLD REALITY OF THE STIGMA ASSOCIATED WITH DIMENSION AGING THAT EXIST IN OUR SOCIETY AND CULTURE. IT'S SILENT. YET IT STILL MANY QUESTIONS WITH NEW ISSUES CROPPING UP CONSTANTLY I SEARCHED HIGH AND LOW FOR RESOURCES. WOULD I TURN TO FOR ADVICE AND GUIDANCE. SOCIALLY ADDRESS MANY CHANGES IN HER BEHAVIOR HOW CAN I BETTER COMMUNICATE WITH HER. OKAY GREAT HANDOVER GROWING NEEDS FOR ASSISTANCE WITH GROOMING AND BATHING TOILETING AND OTHER HYGIENE ISSUES OKAY SAFELY TRANSFER. TRANSFER FROM BED TO WHEEL CHAIR WITHOUT CAUSING HER TO FULLER FOR INJURING MYSELF. I FELT THAT THESE TRAINING EDUCATION NEEDS JUST INCREASED OVER TIME TO MATCH THE PROGRESSIVE MANIFESTATIONS OF THE DISEASE BOTH PHYSICALLY AND BEHAVE REALLY. IT WAS A MOVING TARGET. I VENTURE STARTED TEN IN SOME INDICATION CLASSES OFFERED THROUGH THE ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION. I WAS FORTUNATE BECAUSE THE CLASSES ARE OFFERED CLOSE BY. HE SAYS SESSIONS MADE QUITE A DIFFERENT. HOWEVER I MEAN WE START TO WONDER WHAT OTHER CARE GIVERS DO SPECIALLY THOSE WHO LIVE IN MORE REMOTE PARTS OF THE STATE. OR WHOSE PRIMARY LANGUAGE IS AN ENGLISH HOW DO THESE. TAXES THIS CENTRAL INFORMATION. I QUESTION HOW COME THERE'S NOT THE START THE CLASSES WERE ORIGINALLY OFFERED AT THE LIBRARIES IN OUR OWN COMMUNITIES AT THE CHURCH AS THE MEDICAL OFFICES. AND OTHER COMMUNITY VENUE ECONOMIC COST I WAS WORKING FULL TIME WHEN MY MOTHER CAME TO LIVE WITH US. AND I NEEDED TO CONTINUE TO DO SO HELP COVER THE COST OF OUR CHILDREN'S COLLEGE TUITION AND OTHER EDUCATIONAL COST. IN ADDITION TO ADDRESSING MOMS LIVING EXPENSES. IN ORDER TO CONTINUE WORKING I SECURED A SPOT FOR MOM IN AN ADULT DAY MEMORY CARE PROGRAM IT WAS A LIFE SAVER. I WAS ABLE TO CONTINUE WORKING AND IT ALSO PRIDE IN PROVIDING ME WITH NEEDED RESPITE TIME. IN ADDITION IT SERVES AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OR SOCIALIZATION FOR MY MOM. SHE LOVED HER COFFEE IN CHIEF FIDDLE OF IT THERE. THE DELTA A MEMORY KERR PROGRAMS DEFINITELY SHOULD BE VIEWED AS A VALUABLE AN ESSENTIAL COMMUNITY SERVICE JUST LIKE SO MANY OTHER CENTRALSERVICES. THAT WE SUPPORT WHEN THAT OFFERS CULTURALLY COMPETENT SERVICES TO BEST MEET THE NEEDS OF THE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE. SADLY WEDNESDAY WE WERE INFORMED THAT ARE ADULT A MEMORY KERR PROGRAM WHICH TO BE CLOSED ROUGHLY. IT LEFT ME IN THE OTHER FAMILIES IN A PANIC AND WITH MORE QUESTIONS. WHAT OTHER? THE DEL MEMORY CARE PROGRAMS. ARE AVAILABLE CLOSE BY HOW LONGER THERE WAITING LIST WHAT ARE THE COST WOULD I BE ABLE TO CONTINUE WORK. ULTIMATELY THE DECISIONWAS MADE THAT I NEEDED TO RETIRE EARLY. MY EARLY RETIREMENT HAS VERY ADVERSELY IMPACTED THE LEVEL MY PENSION. AS FORTUNATE TO HAVE A GOOD STEAK CREATOR. WHICH I RECEIVED WHICH IN THIS LOWER AMOUNT WILL IS THE ABOUT OUR SEE THE REST OF MY LIFE. WITH REDUCED MONTHLY EARNINGS ARE HOUSEHOLD INCOME WAS FURTHER IMPACTED BY THE COST OF SUPPLIES MEDICATIONS. AND OTHER ITEMS DATED BY MY MOM. AT TAX TIME I WOULD WONDER. WHY WE COULDN'T TAKE A TAX DEDUCTION FOR CARRYING SUPPORTING MY MY KNOWLEDGE? EVENTUALLY WHEN I CAN NO LONGER TRANSFER MY MOM. FROM HER WHEELCHAIR. TO THE TOILET OR TO HER BED. AND ENSURE HER SAFETY IN OUR HOME WE HAD EXPLORED RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES. THE MONTHLY COST WAS EXORBITANT AND AGAIN RAISE SO MANY MORE QUESTIONS FOR ME. MY MOTHER HAD WORKED ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT WHERE WERE THE AFFORDABLE AFFORDABLE CARE MODELS THAT WOULD. VIED FOR SENIORS WHO NEEDED CARE. AND IF THERE WERE SEVEN OTHER STATES WHY CAN THEY BE REPLICATED HERE. I THOUGHT OFTEN ABOUT THE COOPERATIVE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAD -- WHEN THE CHILDREN WERE IN CHILDCARE? CAN SOMETHING BE PILOTED SO THAT RESIDENTIAL CARE COULD BE MORE AFFORDABLE. THAT FAMILY MEMBERS COULD WORK IN A COMMUNITY AND PROVIDE CULTURALLY COMPETENT OPTIONS FOR DIVERSE POPULATIONS. LESLIE THE TOLL OF PROVIDING TWENTY FOUR SEVEN CARE IS EXTREMELY STRESSFUL AS NOTED BY THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS AND EMOTIONALLY EXHAUSTING. THE ISOLATION IS ALSO DEVASTATING. I INFREQUENTLY SO FRIENDS AND FAMILY. BUT I DID SEE MY DOCTOR WITH GREATER FREQUENCY IS THE EMOTIONAL STRESS TAKEN A TREMENDOUS TOLL ON MY HEALTH AND GENERAL WELL BEING. IT WAS A HARD TIME. I STRUGGLED WITH THE OVERWHELMING FEELINGS OF SHAME AND GUILT FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO DO IT ALL FOR MY MOM. MY MOM DIED LAST YEAR. WHICH IS THE ABOUT THE POST. I AM SO THANKFUL THAT WAS IT WILL SERVICE THE CARE GIVER. I DO ADMIT IS AN I DO MEAN IT WAS THE HARDEST JOB I EVER HAD BUT IT'S ALSO MY GREATEST HONOR. SO I'M STILL PLEASE THANK YOU. CAN PLEASE THAT THIS COMMITTEE IS TAKE A SERIOUS LOOK AT THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE FINAL REPORT ISSUED BY. THE CALIFORNIA TASK FORCE ON FAMILY CARE GIVING. MILLIONS OF AND HOW WE SHOULD TREAT OR CENTERS. THEY SHOULD HAVE A VIABLE ACCESSIBLE CULTURALLY COMPETENT OPTIONS. FOR RESPITE SERVICES. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE INAPPROPRIATE TRAINING EDUCATION RESOURCES TO ASSIST AND HELP THEM WITH THEIR DAILY TASKS. THESE TRAINING SEEM TO BE ACTIVELY ACCESSIBLE GEOGRAPHICALLY OFFERED AT LOWER NO COST AND MADE AVAILABLE IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. ONE OF THE ALL OF YOU AND I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO THINK SENATOR. JACKSON FOR CO AUTHORING. EIGHTY THREE EIGHTY EIGHT I THINK THAT -- I'M OF PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONAL RETIRED. I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS BEGIN COMMUNITIES WE NEED TO BE WORKING WITH COMMUNITIES HEARING THEIR INPUT AND THEIR SUGGESTIONS IN THEIR IDEAS. DIRECTLY SO THAT WE CAN. DEVELOP APPROPRIATE STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS THEM -- THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE FOR THOSE LIVING IN THAT COMMUNITY. PLEASE DO CONSIDER AND TAKE THE NEEDED ACTION. TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED RESOURCES TO ASSIST FAMILY CARE GIVERS AND IN DOING SO YOU'LL ALSO LEE ALSO APPROVED REALLY BE HONORING. OUR DIVERSE SENIOR POPULATION IN THE STATE HAVE DONE SO MUCH TO BUILD THIS WONDERFUL GOLDEN STATE THAT WE ALL LIVE IN TODAY. AND I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU [inaudible] FOR MONEY [inaudible] TO OF THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY AND FOR SHARING YOUR PERSONAL STORY -- THE COMMITMENT YOU'VE SHOWN TO TO YOUR LOVED ONES IS. QUITE TOUCHING AND FOR ME IT DID. PERSONAL TOUCHES MY HEART DADDY HAVE. SIMILAR STORY WITH THE FIELD. GROWING UP IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND IT WOULD TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN SO. THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT. I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS -- BUT I'D LIKE TO OPEN IT UP TO OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS. FOR QUESTIONS FIRST I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL AGAIN ALL -- MANY OF US. HAVE EARLY SEVENTIES SO WE DID NOT GO THROUGH THIS RECORDS SO IT WAS AN EXTRA TEN YEARS THAT I DIDN'T HAVE WITH THEM. AND SOMETIMES YOU WONDER WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE BETTER OPTION AND OF COURSE -- WE ARE AGING WE ARE LIVING LONGER HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE SEEING MORE PEOPLE DEVELOPING -- ALL SORTS OF A COGNITIVE ISSUES AS WELL AS PHYSICAL ISSUES OF DOING A BILL THIS YEAR JUST TO ALLOW. PEOPLE WHO OTHERWISE CAN'T AFFORD TO BE ABLE TO PUT SOMETHING SECOND GRAB BAR IN THE BATHROOM BECAUSE WE KNOW SO I MEAN. THEY'RE SIMPLE THINGS LIKE THAT. OF THEY'RE NOT BUT THEY'RE NOT SIMPLE BECAUSE WE HAD A IF THEY HAVEN'T BEEN IN OUR CONSCIOUSNESS SO I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL. FOR SHARING YOUR STORIES BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE OF BOTH FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T HAD THAT EXPERIENCE AND PEOPLE HAVE AND HAVE NOT CHOP THE TALKED ABOUT IT AND REALLY DO NEED. TO TO TALK ABOUT IT -- BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T THAT OUR SENIORS ARE SORT OF HAVE NOT BEEN. ANYWHERE NEAR ON THE FRONT BURNER BECAUSE CALIFORNIA IS NOW A NEGATIVE BIRTH RATE STATE AND WE'RE REACHING QUITE RAPIDLY. AND LIVING LONGER. THAT BEING SAID -- AND I AM DOING THE BILL ON THE MASTER PLAN AND I AND YOU KNOW IT'S AN ENORMOUS I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHERE TO BEGIN WITH THIS BECAUSE YOU'VE LISTED A VARIETY OF AREAS AND I JUST WAS TRYING TO TAKE THEM DOWN JUST ON ON HEALTH CARE AND LONG TERM. CARE ALONE THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH NURSING HOMES PAID FAMILY LEAVE SOMETHING NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THAT ISSUE QUITE SOME TIME. ADULT DAY CARE HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS TO GIVE RESPITE CARE TO THE TO THE PROVIDER -- TO AND AS YOU MENTIONED A LOT OF FAMILY MEMBERS ARE NOT KIDS THEY ARE OFTEN TIMES SENIORS THEMSELVES OR FAMILY MEMBERS WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING AND HAVE TO DIVIDE TO GET. TO YOU KNOW CAN I CONTINUE TO WORK HOW DO I CARE FOR PEOPLE I LOVE -- AN IN HOME CARE SERVICES PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES ARE PRICES YOU MENTIONED HOW DO WE DO WITH THE MENTION HOW DO WE EDUCATE PEOPLE I MEAN. THIS LIST GOES ON AND ON SO I WANT. WHETHER YOU HAVE BOX ON HOW WE CAN GOING FORWARD TO MEET THESE NEEDS IN LIGHT OF OUR CURRENT WORK FORCE. BY ISSUES WE ARE. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE PROVIDING THAT CARE THEMSELVES A BECAUSE I CAN'T AFFORD. TO HAVE PEOPLE COME INTO THE HOME -- HOW DO WE DEAL WITH EDUCATING PEOPLE HOW DO WE MAKE -- PROVIDING THESE PROGRAMS MORE AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE WHETHER THEY'RE CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE OR CHOOSE THEIR SO THAT -- PEOPLE ARE WELL CARED -- FOR FOR OUR BETTER CARED FOR I SHOULD SAY THAN THEY ARE WITH THE SOME OF THE OPTIONS OF YOU KNOW NURSING HOMES WHICH WE KNOW HAVE BEEN. JUST LACKING IN THE STATE AND PROBABLY THE COUNTRY IN GENERAL SO -- WHAT WHAT DO YOU? THINK WE SHOULD BE DOING TO GET MORE CARE GIVERS INTO THE PROCESS -- WHAT -- TO HOW CAN WE GO ABOUT DEVELOPING CARE PROVIDERS -- DO YOU HAVE ANY -- ANY SOLUTIONS OR ANY SUGGESTIONS THAT WE MIGHT TAKE WITH US BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOUR STORIES ARE BOTH VERY INTIMATE AND BOTH VERY COMMON FOR OTHERS. PROVIDING THAT KIND OF CARE THAT THAT THE CHALLENGES YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH DECIDING. WHO'S GOING TO TAKE CARE OF WHO WIN AND AND HOW DO I WORKING CONTINUE TO GET LONG DISTANCE CARE FOR A PARENT AND HAVING THAT THE PROBLEMS ARE REALLY. EXTRAORDINARY AND VERY VERY DIFFICULT SO I'M I'M SURE YOU'VE HAD SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT IT AND IF WITH THE INDULGENCE OF THE CHAIR WE COULD WE COULD WE HEAR WHAT SOME OF THOSE THOUGHTS ARE. MORE THAN MINE IS. ONE OF MY SUGGESTIONS IS -- HAVING. SKEWS ME -- COMPENSATING PEOPLE WHO ARE TRAINED TO DO PROVIDE THIS RESPITE CARE. SO THAT. THEY CAN DO IT AND AND COME IN AND NOT. BECAUSE I KNOW MY MY COUSIN WHO TOOK CARE OF MY AUNT SHE WAS WORKING DOING STUFF LIKE THIS AND THEN SHE HAD TO LEAVE HER JOB BECAUSE IT WAS PART TIME NO BENEFITS. AND SHE WAS DOING WHAT SHE COULD BUT YET THERE WAS NO COMPENSATION WE DIDN'T KNOW HOW YOU I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW YOU QUALIFY THAT'S MY THING. THERE'S SO MANY. SO MANY. BARRIERS SING THIS I CHECKED INTO DAY DAY CARE FOR MY MOTHER IN LAW WHEN WHEN SHE WAS HERE. I HAD NO CLUE I WILL THEY TELL ME HOW MUCH IT WAS COSTING AND I WENT OH MY GOODNESS I CAN'T DO THAT. WE'RE COVERING HOUSE PAYMENT AND FOOD AND TAKING CARE OF HER BUT YET. THERE'S IS BIG AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT SHE DIDN'T HAVE. BUT NOBODY OFFERED. TO TELL ME WHERE I COULD GO TO SEE IF I QUALIFY UNDER OR IF WE DID I I DON'T SEE THAT IN THE SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENTS IN SOME OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS. TRYING TO HELP. THE MANEUVER THE SYSTEM BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU'RE HERE YOU GO HOME. AND NOT I COME FROM HEALTH CARE TO MART MORE IN THE ADMINISTRATOR FOR HEALTH EDUCATION PART. SO I'M I'VE WORKED WITH PEOPLE FOR A LONG TIME AND I'VE SEEN A LOT OF THESE BARRIERS. I JUST LIKE TO ADD JUST. NINE NO LONGER WORK REPRESENT ORGANIZATION BUT BUT I DO THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT FAMILY CARE GIVERS AS A WORK FORCE. CAN BE TREATED AND GIVEN THE RIGHT SERVE. OF WORKERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND UNSEEN WE SHOULD GET TRAINING WE SHOULD GET IT. RESPITE CARE IS WE HAVE SICK LEAVE AND OTHER BENEFITS TO PEOPLE WHO ARE EMPLOYED. WHERE A VIABLE? ENTITIES IN THE COMMUNITY WE KEEP THE STATE RUNNING AND NOT GOING PRO. AND WE SHOULD BE TREATED WITH ON THAT RESPECT IN GIVEN THOSE CONSIDERATIONS I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY BECAUSE I HAVEN'T REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT ALL THOSE CONSIDERATIONS. BUT ALL OF YOU DO ON A DAILY BASIS AND YOU KNOW. AND I KNOW THAT THE PREVIOUS PANEL TALKED ABOUT THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WE REPRESENT AND HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF OURS THAT WE REPRESENT ALL UNPAID -- YOU KNOW I THINK IN THIS SOCIETY WE USED TO YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW LET CHILDREN WORK BEFORE SIXTEEN OR FIFTEEN THE THINK THE TIME HAS COME FOR US TO REALLY BE AT THE CALL ABOUT THIS. TO GIVE IT CONSIDERATION. TO KNOW THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE CAN'T TO THIS. FOR FOR YEARS AND YEARS WITHOUT IT TAKING A PHYSICAL TOLL. PRESS THE CARE TO ME WHEN I TOOK MY MOM. TO THE DAY PROGRAM I WOULD GET A HUG FROM SOMEBODY IN A DAILY. IT SAY IT'S GONNA BE OKAY AND NOBODY ELSE OFFERED HUGS. BUT I THINK THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE WAY OF BRINGING CARE GIVERS LETTING THEM KNOW WHO THEY ARE BECAUSE CARE GIVERS DON'T SELF IDENTIFY. SO WE DO HAVE TO HAVE A COMBINATION BETWEEN THE CURRENT SOCIAL SUPPORT SYSTEMS LIKE THE CARE GIVER RESOURCE CENTERS AT HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATIONS WHO IDENTIFIED THE CARE GIVERS. SO THAT THERE'S A STRONGER OF DISCUSSION KIND OF REFERRAL SYSTEM BETWEEN THOSE -- TWO AS BECAUSE THERE ARE SYSTEMS OUT THERE OF COURSE ARE THE CARE TO RESEARCH CENTERS. BIASED BUT THEY DO NEED FUNDING BECAUSE OF THE THEY COULD BE OUT IN THE COMMUNITY PROVIDING ALL THE EDUCATION TRAINING ALL OF THAT THAT IS FUNDED BUT WE CERTAINLY NEED AN INFUSION. OF FUNDS THAT ALLOW FOR US TO DELIVER IN MULTIPLE COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. AND IT MAY CULTURALLY SENSITIVE WAYS I'D RESPITE BECAUSE WITH CARE GIVERS COME IN THEY DON'T WANT THE FRAGMENTATION. I THINK THAT IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES WE HAVE IS FRAGMENTATION SO WHEN THEY CAN GO TO WHAT I CALL ONE STOP SHOPPING CENTERS. AND SOMEBODY TALKS TO THEM BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY NEED NO ONE CALLS AND SAYS I'M A CARE GIVER I NEED SERVICES. THEY CALLAND SAY MY MOM IS HAVING TROUBLE AND CAN YOU HELP ME AND THEN YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMEONE ON THE OTHER IN WHO UNDERSTANDS HOW TO SAY. LET'S DISCUSS YOUR MOM BUT LET'S ALSO TALK ABOUT YOU. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ADD I MEAN THERE'S THERE'S SO MUCH TO DO -- IN THIS TOPIC AND IT'S T'S HARD TO DELINEATE WHAT SHOULD COME FIRST AND WHAT THE TIMING IS AND THAT THERE'S JUST SO MUCH BUT I'LL BUT I ALSO WANT TO ADD TO IT. AND I'M I'M FIGURE THAT ONE OUT BUT I ALSO WANT TO ADD TO THE MIX THAT THIS THIS REALLY DOES DESERVE AN INVESTMENT IN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM -- DOING GERIATRICS OR CARE GIVING RELATED -- SCHOOLING AND EDUCATION IS IS AN EMPLOYMENT -- SATISFACTION OFF OFF THE RAILS I MEAN IT'S COMING WE DON'T DO ENOUGH OF IT I KNOW THAT -- IF WE OFFERED MORE GERONTOLOGY CLASSES IF WE OFFERED MORE COURT CARE GIVING CLASSES WE MADE IT PART OF A GENERAL EDUCATION -- COURSE WORK IN COLLEGE AT OUR AT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES I THINK I THINK THAT COULD REALLY BE HELPFUL IT'S IT'S NOT OFFERED VERY OFTEN NOW -- AND I THINK THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO GO INTO THAT WORK IF IF IT WAS PRESENTED TO THEM AND IF THEY WERE AWARE OF IT SO. I THINK INVESTMENT IN ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT LEVELS LIKE THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL AS WE FIGURE OUT ALL THESE OTHER -- BIG BIG BIG QUESTIONS THAT RELY UPON ONE ANOTHER. THINKING. THANK YOU AN HOUR THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TESTIMONY -- AND I MEAN. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT -- IN ADDITION -- TO AUTHORING AT SB FIVE TWELVE TO TRY TO LOOK AT SORT OF THE HOW WE WOULD FINANCE ESPECIALLY SUPPORT FOR MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES. ALSO WORKING WITH THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS SCIENCE SP -- FOUR FORTY TO FOR TASK FORCE ON SERVING ADULTS WITH US TALKING TO THE WELFARE DIRECTORS AND THEY CAME TO ME. REALIZE THAT -- LOVER SOCIAL SERVICE PROGRAMS REALLY AREN'T TARGETED TOWARDS HOLDS -- AND SO -- AND THAT -- THEY RECOGNIZE SUCH THAT THERE'S A GAP THERE -- CERTAINLY AS A AS A PEDIATRICIAN WHO TAKES CARE AT THE OTHER END OF THE AGE SPECTRUM -- I IT IT'S LIKE ME ACCIONES SPECIAL NEEDS ONE OF THE THINGS I HEARD FREQUENTLY FROM PARENTS WAS IS THAT WE HAD. TO THE AT THE KEY ACCORDING TO CARE COORDINATORS RIGHT JUST LOTS NOW SO THE FRAGMENTATION SO I'D BE SURE YOU BRING THAT UP I'M. SURE THAT'S SIMILAR IF THE AT THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM AND THAT OFTENTIMES WILL HAPPEN IS IS THAT WILL HAVE -- DIFFERENT PROGRAMS -- AND NOW THAT COME UP IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND THEN MEANWHILE THE FAMILIES ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO NAVIGATE THE MEASURE EVEN AWARE OF SOME OF THEM. AND SELL THAT -- LOOKING FOR TO OUR FOR THE CONVERSATIONS ACTUALLY WITH THE WITH THE YEAH. AGENCY ON AGING ABOUT HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE. FULLER SOME OF THAT TOGETHER SO THERE'S LESS OF A BURDEN ON ON FAMILIES AS WELL AND ALSO -- MAKE IT EASIER FOR THEM TO BE AWARE OF AFFAIRSPROGRAMS BUT CERTAINLY WE WE HAVE BOTH A CHALLENGE ON BOTH -- NOT ONLY THAT THE TYPE OF SERVICES WE HAVE AND THEN THE SCALE WHICH WE ABLE DELIVER THAT WHICH WE HEARD FROM THE LAST PANEL. SO I ALSO APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR AND I GUESS YOU HAVE THE BILL ON THE MASTER PLAN ALL RIGHT LOOKS IKE WE HAVE WHAT. I LOOK FOR TO TO TO TO SEE HOW THAT GOES TO AS WELL NAY RECORD INTENSE UP AS WELL TOGETHER EXACTLY WHAT WILL ENSURE WE WILL. SO AND OF COURSE WITH THAT THE OTHER MEMBERS THIS COMMITTEE AS WELL SO I THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. OKAY THANK YOU -- I'LL I WAS I HAD A I HAD A QUESTION ABOUT -- THE PROCESS IT SEEMS LIKE. IT'S CUMBERSOME TO GO ASK FOR CARE. ORDER THINGS WE HAVE TO DO TO STREAMLINE. THE PROCESS FOR PEOPLE TO MAKE IT SIMPLER -- FOR I I A I'M FAMILIAR WITH -- THE LETTERMAN ACT BECAUSE I HAVE A FAMILY MEMBER OR THAT. MY WIFE AND AYE CARE -- FOR FOR A LONG TIME MY STEP SON. WHO IS IN THE LETTERMAN ACT OKAY SO SO I FROM EARTH THE PRESUMPTION THAT IS GIVEN TO SOMEBODY WITH THE LATTER ENACT? IT'S THE STATUS I DON'T THINK -- AGING SENIORS HAVE. THERE DISABLED IS TO SAY WE SHOULD HAVE. THE STATUS OF BECAUSE WHAT A CORPORATE OR CALL PRESUMPTION OF NEED. YOU PRESUME THE PERSON NEEDS THESE THINGS SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH. OF A LOT OF PROCEDURAL KINDS OF THINGS. TO RECEIVE CARE OR ASSISTANCE -- AND AND I WONDER I WONDER IF -- WHEN WE LOOK AT? THE LAWS THE MASTER PLAN AND HOW WE GO ABOUT THIS. WE SHOULD HAVE A PRESUMPTION GIVEN. SIMILAR TO WHAT HAPPENS IN THE LATTER ENACT. FOR THOSE THAT HAVE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. AND YOU KNOW I THINK THAT I THINK -- IT IT. MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO ME. THAT AND THEN I I HAD A QUESTION ABOUT INSURANCE -- STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE ANY THESE KINDS OF SYSTEMS AND BE EXPANDED. TO PROVIDE COVERAGE HAVE YOU HEARD OF ANY OTHER AND YOU HAVE YOUR ANY OTHER STATES HAVE DONE ANYTHING IN THESE AREAS. ANYWHERE ELSE -- YOUR ORGANIZATIONS -- I DON'T KNOW THOSE ARE MY QUESTIONS DO YOU HAVE. HAVE YOU FEEL ABOUT WHAT I'M SAYING. CURRENTLY THE STI SYSTEM FOR CALIFORNIA WE HAVE PAID FMILY LEAVE. BUT IT ISN'T -- THERE'S NO JOB PROTECTION. FOR ADDED -- IS BEING UNDER UTILIZED BY AND I KNOW SENATOR JACKSON DOES THIS BY OUR FAMILY CARE GIVERS BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE JUST NOT -- HEARING ENOUGH ABOUT IT PLUS THE WAGE REPLACEMENT -- PROBABLY NEEDS TO BE YOU KNOW IF INCOME -- AND A LITTLE BECAUSE THERE IS THAT FLEXIBILITY BUT IT'S HARD TO GET THROUGH THAT SYSTEM I AMONG THE PANEL FOR WITH EDT AND WE'RE STILL TRYING TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR FAMILY CAREGIVERS WHO. WHO -- YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE IT ALL AT ONCE AND YOU CAN TAKE IT INTERMITTENTLY BUT THE INTERMITTENT IS VERY DIFFICULT IN TERMS OF THE PAPERWORK FOR THAT. SO GIVE AND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT THE SYSTEM I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU AND THE MORE THAT WE COULD HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM. THAT DOES KIND OF SAY COME IN WE KNOW IF YOU SELF IDENTIFY THAT'S ONE OF THE HARDER THINGS IS TO GET THAT CARE GIVERS SELF IDENTIFICATION. BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU JUST UP% HERE GEARS SPOUSE OR YOUR THE HUSBAND A YEAR THE DAUGHTER YOU'RE A GOOD FRIEND TRYING TO TAKE CARE SOMEONE -- SO WE DO HAVE TO WORK PART OF THAT IS GETTING THE WORD OUT AND HAVING ENOUGH. ADVERTISING AND PEOPLE TO GET THAT WORD OUT. TO CORRECT THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME AND I'M. I'M SORRY. I SEE IT AS A AS A PROCESS THAT WOULD BE -- PART OF WHEN THE DIAGNOSIS IS GIVEN. THAT THEY WOULD BE EITHER. REFERRED. TO AN AGENCY OR OF A PLACE THAT. WE'RE GONNA SEND YOU THERE AND THEN WHAT THEY DO IS THEY GO OVER WHATEVER THAT DISEASE PROCESSES AND WHAT OF THE SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN CASE YOU SHOULD NEED THEM. BOB. I MEAN WHEN I RENT A HEALTH EDUCATION CENTER I DID THAT AND I'M NOT A HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL I A PROVIDED THE AGENCY OF THE DIAGNOSIS THEY WERE GIVEN. BUT I DIDN'T KNOW ALL THE SERVICES THAT ARE. AND THEN I READ IN THE PAPER. SOME COUNTIES DON'T EVEN OFFER SOME OF THESE SERVICES SO MY FAMILY AND MODERATE CAN'T BENEFIT FROM SOME OF THE SERVICES WE HAVE HERE. BECAUSE THEY'RE DIFFERENT SO I WOULD BE TALKING TO THEM AND GIVING THEM THE WRONG INFORMATION SO WHEN MY FATHER Là WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER I WENT TO THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY TO FIND OUT WHAT. WHAT? WE COULD DO ARE I COULD DO TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE PROCESS OF OF CANCER AND WHAT WE COULD DO -- IT WASN'T FROM THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IT WAS ON MY OWN BUT YET I'M. I KNEW BECAUSE I WAS RUNNING THE CENTER. WHEN MY MOTHER LONG GOT DIAGNOSED WITH ALZHEIMER'S I WENT TO THE ALSO -- ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION TO SEE. YOU KNOW WHAT ARE SOME OF THE SERVICES THAT ARE THERE AND THE WORLD LOT LACKING THEIR THEIR NON PROFITS THEY RUN ON PEOPLE'S DONATIONS. THEY'RE NOT FUNDED BY -- YOU NO WELL THIS IS WHAT WE CAN PROVIDE FOR YOU. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO ASK FOR BECAUSE YOUR CALL TO TO HELP FAMILY MEMBER AND YOU DO IT. I MEAN THAT'S THE WAY WE'RE-RAISES ALL I THINK WHEN YOU'RE GIVEN THE DIAGNOSIS THERE SHOULD BE [inaudible] OF OF SOMEONE WITHIN YOUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM I MEAN INSURANCE PREMIUMS ARE NOT ARE JUST NOT SHOULDN'T JUST BE. TO HEAL YOUR BODY AT THAT POINT BUT TO TO HELP. TRANSITION YOU TO THE NEXT PHASE TO GET YOU GOING IT DOESN'T MEAN THEY HAVE TO COVER EVERYTHING BUT THERE SHOULD BE A PATHWAY AND THERE'S NOT. I MEAN I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO EXCEPT FOR MY EXPERIENCE IN. DOING THAT THAT I WOULD PROBABLY CALL AN ORGANIZATION THAT. DEPENDS ON WHO I GET SO JUST. JUST TO BUILD ON THAT I I THINK. PARTICULAR WITH ALZHEIMER'S AND OTHER DEMENTIAS IT'S AS IF HIS BRAIN DISEASE -- LEADING KILLER IN THE STATE. AND YET WE GET A DIAGNOSIS FOR MEDICAL PROVIDER. SOMETIMES RELUCTANTLY OR WITH MUCH DIFFICULTY. AND THEN IT SEEMS LIKE A HEALTH PLAN SHOULD BE MORE ACCOUNTABLE FOR PROVIDING ADDITIONAL SERVICES AS WELL. OBVIOUSLY WE HIT PRESCRIPTIONS WITH -- AND REFERRAL STERN NUMEROLOGIST AND SOME OTHER CARE ABOUT DURABLE EQUIPMENT. BUT DID YOU SEE MORE THIS THE FIRST FAMILY. IN THE IN A MAY BE SIMILAR TO HEALTH THINGS -- DEALT WITH WITH AUTISM. ON A FEW YEARS CRISIS OF IS NOW UNDER THE LETTERMAN YEAH. THAT YOU KNOW MORE IS THE CONTROL DECK THIS ISN'T GOING TO TAKE CARE OF IT IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF A LONG AND ARDUOUS JOURNEY. AND WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE HEALTH PLAN IN HELPING -- THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE FAMILY WITH THIS FATAL AT THIS POINT CHRONIC DISEASE. HOPEFULLY THINGS WILL CHANGE IN THE FUTURE BUT THAT'S NOT A REALITY TODAY. YEAH I LIKE TO THINK WERE YOUR MOM FOR SERVICE TO MY COMMUNITY. SALAS AND ALSO LIKE TO THANK YOUR SON. FOR HIS WORK AS MY A LEGISLATIVE ASSISTANT. TAKE IT. OUT OF HIM. BUT I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR MOM WAS A WONDERFUL PERSON SHE WAS WELL RESPECTED AND WELL KNOWN IS A POWERFUL WOMAN IN. SAN JOSE AND WITH SAYS ARE JUST SAYS -- ALSO THANK YOU. THANK [inaudible] GOODNESS. SO OUR THIRD AND FINAL PANEL WILL DISCUSS RESOURCES AND SUPPORTS THE PROMISING DIRECTIONS. BY ONCE AGAIN WILL SET A TIME LIMIT FOR PALACE AT FIVE TO SEVEN MINUTES AND THEN OPEN FOR QUESTIONS FROM OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MISTER COREY PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU ARE READY [inaudible] RICHARD. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JOE CLOVER I AM THE DIRECTOR OF PASSAGES. AND PASSAGE IS IS A GREAT SERVICE PROGRAM TO CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY CHICO RESEARCH FOUNDATION -- I'M FORTUNATE IN THAT -- MY AGENCIES A DESIGNATED. AREA AGENCY ON AGING AND WE ARE A DESIGNATED CARE GIVER RESOURCE CENTER. OFF SO I HAVE BOTH FEDERAL FUNDS IN STATE FUNDS AND ON THAT IT GIVES ME SOME GREAT ADVANTAGES -- I'M ABLE TO PROVIDE. A FULL MENU OF SERVICES FOR CARE GIVERS THAT IF I WAS JUST CARE GIVE RESOURCE CENTER REGISTRABLE A WOULD BE LIMITED SO. I FEEL FORTUNATE -- HAVING BOTH FUNDING STREAMS NOT ONLY GIVES ME A BETTER A MENU OF SERVICES TO OFFER. BUT IT ALSO ALLOWS ME TO MATCH THOSE DOLLARS AGAINST EACH OTHER AND I THINK AT LONG MENTIONED EARLIER THAT -- UNDER THE TRIPLE A.'S THAT IT IS LOCAL COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBLE FOR COMING UP WITH THE MATCH AND SO THE STATE FUNDED CARE RESOURCE CENTER ALLOWS ME TO PROVIDE THE TWENTY FIRST PERCENT BUT AGAIN I THINK MOST IMPORTANTLY I'M ABLE. TO TO LEVERAGE MORE SERVICES FOR THE CARE GIVERS NOW THAT MY SERVICE AREA IT. CONSTITUTES TEN COUNTIES IS QUITE LARGE -- IT'S VERY CHALLENGING -- IF YOU'RE A CARE GIVER AND YOU'RE LIVING IN -- AND YOU NEED ASSISTANCE -- IT'S A LONG WAY TO TRAVEL IF YOU'RE GONNA GO SEE A SPECIALIST YOU KNOW YOU'RE TRAVELING TO DAVIS OR YOUR TRAVELING SACRAMENTO -- INFORMALLY WE'VE KIND OF FIGURED IT COULD BE LIKE FIVE SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR SOMEBODY TAKE A TRIP TO THE HOSPITAL. BUT THE PERSON THAT'S IN A SEPARATE ALZHEIMER'S AND SUCH SO. THERE'S SOME REAL CHALLENGES IN OUR AREA -- PART OF THOSE CHALLENGES HAS REQUIRED THAT WE APPROACH OUR SERVICES A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT -- WE HAVE TO BE VERY FLEXIBLE WITH THEIR CARE GIVERS -- SO THEY CAN ACCESS OUR PROGRAMS. SO -- RESPITE IS TALKED A LOT ABOUT AND IT'S IT'S A WONDERFUL PROGRAM FOR CAREGIVERS THEY NEEDED BUT THE FUNDING THAT WE HAVE WE JUST WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO GIVE RESPITE TO EVERY CARE GIVER. NOT ONLY THAT SOME OF OUR COMMUNITIES ARE STILL RURAL THERE'S NOT EVEN REALLY THE SOCIAL SERVICES INFRASTRUCTURE TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES AGAIN ALL THESE MODOC COUNTY OR TRINITY COUNTY. TRYING TO FIND AN ORGANIZATION THAT HAS -- RESPITE WORKERS PLUMAS COUNTY YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE WORKED ON CONTRACTS AND GUESS WHAT. YOU'VE GOT FOUR HOURS A MONTH FOR ME. NO ONE'S GOING TO DO THAT SO IS THERE SOME REAL CHALLENGES WITH IT SO WELL RESPITE. IS AREA. CRITICAL IMPORTANT PIECE THE SERVICE WE REALLY EMBRACE THE EMPOWERMENT MODEL OF THE CARE GIVER RESOURCE CENTERS AND THE AND THE TITLE THREE CARE GIVER PROGRAMS. THAT WERE REALLY WORKING WITH OUR CLIENTS RULES THE EDUCATION THE TRAINING TO CARE FOR THE FOLKS AT HOME AND WALL RESPITE IS ALWAYS THERE AND IT'S PART OF THAT IT'S IT'S NOT THE COMPLETE PACKAGE. AND I WANT TO SHARE A STORY ABOUT ONE OF OUR CARE GIVERS THAT'D COME TO US AND IT WAS A COUPLE YEARS BACK. THIS PERSON CAME AND WAS A LITTLE DESPONDENT WAS INTERESTED IN THE PROGRAM BUT WASN'T QUITE SURE. BUT WE INVITED HER TO OUR ANNUAL RETREAT IT'S A THREE DAY RETREAT WHERE WE TAKE THE CARE GIVERS WOULD TAKE AWAY WE COULDN'T EDUCATION TRAINING -- WE PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO BE OUT OF THE HOUSE -- DO SOME SELF FULFILLMENT SOME SELF GROWTH. AND CHEERFUL STAND OFFICE SHE LIKE THE PROGRAM BUT THEN SHE WASN'T QUITE THERE. BUT SHE CAME BACK IN TO CONTINUE WITH OUR PROGRAM SHE DID -- WEEKLY MONTHLY -- SUPPORT GROUPS -- SHE TENDED. AND SHE BUT STILL STANDOFFISH AND THEN THE SECOND YEAR SHE CAME BACK AND DID THREE TREAT WITH US AGAIN AND THIS YEAR. WE SAW A DEFINITE DIFFERENCE AND HER -- SHE ASKED A ROOM WITH ONE OF THE OTHER CARE GIVERS SHE WAS MORE ENGAGED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE WEEKEND IN THE PROCESS. AND NOT TOO LONG AGO WE GOT A CALL FROM RECENT MAKE SURE YOU PUT ME DOWN ONCE AGAIN I WANT TO GO TO THE RETREAT THIS YEAR WHICH WAS A REALLY GOOD SIGN. IT WAS INTERESTING WHEN WE LOOK BACK AT HER -- RECORD THAT EACH YEAR SINCE THE BEGINNING SHE ASKED FOR LESS AND LESS RESPITE BECAUSE HE HAD GAINED THE TOOLS FROM THESE PROGRAMS TO CARE FOR HER FAMILY MEMBER BUT I THINK AS IMPORTANTLY TO CARE FOR HERSELF SO SHE WASN'T AS DEPENDENT ON THIS PROGRAM. NOW. IN MY TENT COUNTIES WE HAVE A BUDGET OF ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS SO IN SOME WAYS IS PRETTY GOOD WERE SERVING ABOUT. TWO HUNDRED REGISTERED FAMILY CAREGIVERS IN OUR PROGRAM. IF I IF I RUN THAT OUT IN THE YEAR IT'S ABOUT THREE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER CARE GIVER. NOW YOU COMPARE THAT TO WHAT THE COST OF THE BED Là SKILLED NURSING FACILITY AS AND I WOULD ARGUE THE MAJORITY OF THOSE TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE COULD PROBABLY BE IN A BAD. BUT IT'S THAT CARE GIVER THOSE WILLING. TO STICK WITH THE PARENT STICK WITH HER AUNT OR UNCLE THEIR LOVED ONE AND WORK WITH THEM. BUT I THINK THE ONLY WAY THAT THEY CAN REALLY DO THAT SUCCESSFULLY. IS IF THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THESE CARE GIVER PROGRAMS SO THAT'S KINDOF OUR STORY AND AND I'VE GOT. PLENTY MORE DETAILS BUT I THINK OTHER PEOPLE NEED TO SPEAK GONNA SAY THAT. THESE ARE INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS AND I THINK SOME QUESTIONS THAT CAME UP IN THE LAST PANEL WHAT ARE SOME THINGS WE CAN LOOK AT AND DO TO BRING FORWARD. I THINK BETWEEN THE CARE GIVER RESOURCE CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA AND THE TRIPLE A.'S YOU HAVE A PHENOMENAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT ALREADY EXISTS IT'S IN PLACE AND IT'S BEEN IN PLACE FOR A LONG TIME. I THINK WITH RELATIVELY. MINOR AMOUNT OF FUNDING. THIS EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE CAN BE ALTERING FOR THE DIRECTION I THINK THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS GOING NOW THANK YOU [inaudible] IT'S YOU -- FOR YOU WILL GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE SENATE HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE MY NAME IS SERRA STAINED HAUSEN. AND I'M SENIOR POLICY ADVISER WITH TH SCANNED FOUNDATION THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND FOR THE INVITATION TO TESTIFY. YOU'VE HEARD A LOT. ABOUT TREMENDOUS INSIGHT INTO THE RANGE OF ISSUES THAT IMPACT OUR CARE GIVERS AS WELL AS THE REALLY IMPORTANT RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO SERVE THE POPULATION. BUT THE FOCUS OF MY REMARKS ACTUALLY STEMS FROM A LOT OF THE CONVERSATION YOU JUST HAD IN THE PRIOR PANEL WHICH IS REALLY CRITICAL. IT RELATES TO HOW CARE GIVERS ACCESS THE INFORMATION AND SERVICES THAT THEY NEED. ARMS SO L. L. ELOQUENTLY EXPRESSED BY MRS SALDOVAR MISS MARK HAS AND DR BENTON WHEN CARE GIVERS ARE PLACED INTO A SITUATION WHERE THEY KNOW THAT THEIR LOVED. ONE NEED SOME SORT OF SUPPORT IN THE HOME OR IN THE COMMUNITY. THEY USUALLY DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO FOR HELP THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY NEED AND THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET IT. SO EVERY DAY WE HEAR STORIES OF PEOPLE STRUGGLING TO WEAVE TOGETHER THE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THAT THEY NEED TO REMAIN AT HOME AND AVOID INSTITUTIONALIZATION. FAMILIES DON'T KNOW WHERE TO TURN FOR HELP SERVICES THEIR BOUNCE BETWEEN PROGRAMS WITH LITTLE ASSURANCES THAT THEIR NEEDS CAN BE MET. SO THE THE PROBLEM IS REALLY MULTI FACETED AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF REASONS WHY THE SYSTEM IS LIKE THIS AND SO FRAGMENTED. ON MOST OF THESE PROGRAMS THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT ALL HAVE DIFFERENT ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA DIFFERENT FUNDING STREAMS ARE RUN OUT OF SOMETIMES DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS. AND THEY HAVE DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT PROCESS SEES THOSE YOU'VE HEARD YOU CAN BE BOUNCED AROUND FROM PROGRAM TO PROGRAM WITH DIFFERENT ASSESSMENTS. AND NOT KNOWING WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO GET EVERYTHING YOU NEED. BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT IT IS AS A STATE WE CAN DO A LOT BETTER. THEY'RE IS PROMISING POTENTIAL TO MEET INDIVIDUAL NEEDS AND A MORE HUMAN CENTERED FASHION WITH ACCESS TO A SEAMLESS SET OF SERVICES. SO AS AN EXAMPLE CALIFORNIA'S AGING AND DISABILITY RESOURCE CENTERS WHICH ARE CALLED EIGHTY ARE SEIZE. AND BASIC TO DO JUST THIS THEY TRY TO STREAMLINE ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND SUPPORTS FOR OLDER ADULTS PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. FAMILY CARE GIVERS AND VETERANS ANYBODY WHO NEEDS SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. EIGHTY ARE SEIZE OPERATE AS A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN AREA AGENCIES ON AGING AND CENTERS FOR INDEPENDENT LIVING. AND THEY PROVIDE INFORMATION AND REFERRAL COUNSELING ABOUT AVAILABLE L. TSS LONG TERM SERVICE PRO SUPPORTS PROGRAMS AND BENEFITS. SHORT TERM SERVICE COORDINATION SO IF YOU NEED A LITTLE HELP IN CONNECTING YOUR LOVED ONE WITH A SERVICE OR SUPPORT THEY CAN PROVIDE THAT. AS WELL IS REALLY IMPORTANT TRANSITION HOT -- SERVICES WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL TRANSIT WHEN THEY TRANSITION FROM A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY BACK HOME THOSE ARE OFTEN THE MOST CRITICAL TIMES WHEN PEOPLE NEED SERVICES AND SUPPORTS ITS IN THOSE MOMENTS OF TRANSITION. BUT ULTIMATELY THIS MODEL SEEKS TO EMPOWER THE CONSUMER TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO MAKE THE MOST INFORMED CHOICES FOR THEMSELVES. AT WAR ON WITH THEIR LOVED ONES. THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT IN CALIFORNIA EIGHTY ARE SEIZE ARE AVAILABLE IN ONLY EIGHT OF OUR COUNTIES. TO DATE THERE HAS BEEN NO STATE GENERAL FUND RESOURCES COMMITTED TO THE EFFORT. AND IN THEIR ONLY HAS BEEN VERY LIMITED FUNDING COMING FROM FEDERAL GRANTS SO COUNTIES ARE LEFT RIGHT NOW THOSE THAT DO OPERATE THESE PROGRAMS THEY'RE TRYING TO PULL TOGETHER THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED. JUST TO KEEP THEM GOING. CALIFORNIA HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BUILD ITS EIGHTY ARE SYNCED AB R. C. SYSTEM INTO SOMETHING THAT'S MUCH MORE IN LINE WITH ITS VISION INTO A NO WRONG DOOR SYSTEM. WITH STREAMLINED ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND SUPPORTS IN ALL AREAS OF THE STATE WHERE ANYONE CAN BE CONNECTED TO THE FULL RANGE OF COMMUNITY BASED OF OPTIONS AVAILABLE. REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY ENTER THE SYSTEM. ULTIMATELY THIS APPROACH HELPS INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR CARE GIVERS NAVIGATE RESOURCES THEY NEED FOR A MORE PERSON CENTERED APPROACH. TO WHAT WE REALLY NEED RIGHT NOW IS FROM THE STATE IS LEADERSHIP AND THE INVESTMENT INTO MAKING THIS VISION A REALITY. WE HAVE SEEN OTHER STATES THAT HAVE DONE THIS QUITE SUCCESSFULLY WASHINGTON HAS A NO WRONG DOOR SYSTEM -- AND THEY HAD A REALLY CLEAR FIVE YEAR PLAN OF WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO BUILD OUT THERE AT RC SYSTEM TO BE A STATE WIDE NO WRONG DOOR SYSTEM. THEY HAVE LEVERAGE TECHNOLOGY AND DEVELOPED A SINGLE UNIFIED ASSESSMENT PROCESS TO ENABLE COORDINATED ACCESS TO SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE ARE SUCCESSFUL MODELS ARE OR NEW EMERGING MODELS IN CALIFORNIA THAT HELP OUR MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS. PEOPLE WHO HAVE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID HOW I'M SEEKING ACCESS TO INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED TO MAKE MORE INFORMED DECISIONS ON SPECIFICALLY ON THEIR HEALTH CARE SERVICE DELIVERY OPTIONS. WE SEE NEW PLATFORMS EMERGING SUCH AS THAT OFFERED BY A WEBSITE CALLED MY ARE MY CHOICE THAT HELPS INDIVIDUALS UNDERSTAND THEIR RANGE OF NEEDS. THE EIGHTY R. C. MODEL HOLDS TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL TO BE TO BE BUILT INTO A NO WRONG DOOR SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA BUT THIS POTENTIAL CAN ONLY BE REALIZED WITH THE LEADERSHIP AND COMMITMENT FROM THE STATE. SO I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMITMENT -- TO AND TO HAVING THIS HEARING AND FOR SHINING A LIGHT ON THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA'S FAMILY CARE GIVERS I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS IMPORTANT HEARING ON RECOGNIZING THE BENEFITS THE NEEDS OF FAMILY CARE GIVERS I AM VERY HAPPY TO BE THE FINAL PRESENTER ON THIS PANEL. MY NAME IS STEPHANIE WILSON AND I AM THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR FOR THE TRIPLE OUR ADULT DAY PROGRAM HERE IN SACRAMENTO. AND I ALSO SERVE ON THE CATS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AS THEIR VICE PRESIDENT. THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION FOR ADULT DAY SERVICES ALSO KNOWN AS CADS. IS A NOT FOR PROFIT ORGAN AT NOT FOR PROFIT ASSOCIATION THAT HAS BEEN SUPPORTING ADVANCING AND LEADING ADULT DAY SERVICES SINCE. NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN AND IT WAS VERY GRATIFYING TO HEAR SO MANY INSTANCES THIS -- DURING THIS PANEL OF PEOPLE USING ADULT DAY. CATS REPRESENTS ALL LICENSE FORMS OF ADULT DAY SERVICES INCLUDING ADULT DAY HEALTH CARE KNOWN AS EIGHTY EIGHT TO SEE. COMMUNITY BASED ADULT SERVICES. ALSO NOTE KNOWN AS SEA BASS AN ADULT A SUPPORT PROGRAMS AND REGIONAL CENTER VENDOR IS PROGRAMS. IN CALIFORNIA THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT CC BASS CENTERS WHICH ARE LICENSED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH PUBLIC HEALTH AND OUR CERTIFIED FOR MEDI CAL BY. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF AGING THERE ARE ALSO TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT ADULT DAY SUPPORT PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE WHICH ARE LICENSED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. CATS PHILOSOPHY INCLUDES A PERSON CENTERED CARE THAT EMPHASIZES CHOICE IN INDEPENDENCE THROUGH AN ALTERNATIVE O INSTITUTIONAL CARE. THAT WORKS IN COLLABORATION WITH MEDICAL PROVIDERS FORMAL AND INFORMAL CAREGIVERS AND COMMUNITY SERVICES. I WOULD LIKE TO JUST TALK JUST FOR A FEW MY PARTICULAR PROGRAM WHICH IS A LICENSED ADULT DAY SOCIAL MODEL -- FOCUSED ON DEMENTIA CARE OPERATED BY THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO TO GIVE YOU JUST A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ABOUT HOW ADULT DAY PROGRAM SUPPORT FAMILY CAREGIVERS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO OPENED OUR FIRST TRIPLE OUR ADULT DAY CENTER TWENTY SEVEN YEARS AGO A FEW BLOCKS AWAY FROM THE CAPITAL AT THE HEART SENIOR CENTER. TO ALLOW CARE GIVERS RESPITE FROM THERE ROUND THE CLOCK DUTIES AND TO PROVIDE A PLACE OF BELONGING FOR PEOPLE WITH DEMENTIA. COULD BE ACTIVE AND SOCIALIZE WHILE ALSO GETTING THEIR PERSONAL CARE NEEDS ADDRESSED. SINCE NINETEEN NINETY TWO THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO HAS OPENED TWO ADDITIONAL SITES FOR A TOTAL OF THREE SITES. THAT TOGETHER CURRENTLY SERVE APPROXIMATELY HUNDRED FAMILIES PER DAY. GENERALLY THE OLDER ADULTS WITH DEMENTIA IS LIVING IN THE HOME WITH THE FAMILY MEMBER. OFTEN WHEN OF OF THEIR ADULT CHILDREN THE PRIMARY CARE GIVER USUALLY HAS HIS. FAMILY OF HIS OR HER ON THAT THEY'RE RAISING AND ARE ALSO WORKING EITHER PART OR FULL TIME. SO THEY FALL INTO THE CATEGORY THAT WE ARE NOW RECOGNIZING AS THE QUOTE ON QUOTE SANDWICH GENERATION. TAKING CARE OF BOTH THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR PARENTS AT THE SAME TIME. CARE GIVERS MUST BALANCE THE CARE NEEDS OF THE OLDER ADULT WITH THEIR OWN NEED TO WORK AND BUILD RETIREMENT SAVINGS FOR THEMSELVES. AT TRIPLE ARE WE ARE OPEN LONG PROGRAM SIX PM TO ALLOW A CARE GIVER TO DROP THEIR PARENT OFF BEFORE WORK AND PICK THEM UP AFTER WORK. IN ADDITION WE OFFER SATURDAY PROGRAM HOURS QUARTERLY TO GIVE CARE GIVERS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR TRUE RESPITE. TO GO TO THE MOVIES OR THEIR CHILD'S SOCCER GAME OR JUST GO HOME AND TAKE A NAP. WHEN A FAMILY CHOOSES TRIPLE OUR OUR STAFF IN THE PERSON? OF THE FAMILY THAT THE FAMILY OF THE PERSON WITH DEMENTIA BECOMES A CARE TEAM -- AS CERTIFIED DEMENTIA CAPABLE SPECIALISTS WE TRAIN OUR STAFF IN PERSON CENTERED CARE. CREATE A PERSONALIZED CARE PLAN FOR EACH MEMBER OF OUR PROGRAM WE USE OUR KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE TO DETERMINE WHAT DEMENTIA COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES WORK BEST FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL. AND WE THEN SHARE THOSE STRATEGIES WITH THE FAMILY TO USE AT HOME. IN ANNUAL SURVEYS CONDUCTED WAS PARTICIPATING FAMILIES ARE OVER ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR LOVED ONE LONGER AT HOME. AVOIDING INSTITUTIONALIZATION THAN THEY WOULD HAVE WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF ADULT DAY. POTENTIALLY SAVING A LOT OF MONEY. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OTHER WAY SPENT ON LONG. TERM CARE OUTSIDE THE HOME. THEY ALSO REPORTED TO THE OLDER ADULT BETTER AT NIGHT AND DISPLAYS LESS ANXIETY AFTER A DAY ON THE PROGRAM. TO ENCOURAGE THE CARE GIVERS EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH -- TRIPLER PROVIDES SEVERAL SUPPORT PROGRAM SO THIS IS OUTSIDE OF THE ADULT DAY PROGRAM ITSELF WE HAVE A MONTHLY SUPPORT GROUP MEETING THAT WE CO FACILITY WITH ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION. AND IN ADDITION WE HAVE TO MOLD SAY SIR SERIES INTENSIVE STATE MEET BIMONTHLY FOR FIVE MONTHS ONE OF THESE INTENSIVES FOCUSES ON CURRENT CARE GIVERS AND HOW TO MAINTAIN THEIR OWN. PHYSICAL EMOTIONAL AND SPIRITUAL HEALTH TO OPTIMALLY CARE FOR THEMSELVES TO AVOID CAREGIVER BURNOUT SERVER PROVIDING TRAINING NOT ONLY AND HOW TO CARE. FOR THE OLDER ADULT BUT ALSO HOW TO KEEP THEMSELVES HEALTHY AND AVOIDING BURN OUT WE ALSO HAVE A SECOND INTENSIVE -- THERE WAS SOME TALK ABOUT THIS EARLIER IN THE PANEL -- FOCUSING ON PEOPLE WHO ARE NO LONGER CARE GIVERS DUE TO THE-DEATH OF THEIR LOVED ONE AND THEY'RE HAVING A REALLY HARD TIME GETTING BACK ON TRACK AND MOVING THROUGH THEIR GRIEF TO A NEW LIFE. SO THESE ARE PEOPLE OF SOMEBODY MENTIONED THAT THEY HAD PROVIDED CARE FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS. THAT'S A REALLY LONG TIME THAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING THE SAME THING YEAR AFTER YEAR AND THEN SUDDENLY WHEN THAT JOB GOES AWAY PEOPLE HAVE. A CRISIS. WE ALSO OFFER QUARTERLY WORKSHOPS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DORO CARE GIVER RESOURCE CENTER ON SOME OF THE LOGISTICAL ASPECTS OF CARE GIVIG. TOPICS IN THESE WORKSHOPS INCLUDE HOW GIVING INFORMATION AND RESOURCES FOR LEGAL FINANCIAL AND MEDICAL QUESTIONS HOW TO PREVENT FALLS AT HOME AND MUCH MORE. OUR MONTHLY SUPPORT GROUP AND QUARTERLY WORKSHOPS ARE FREE. THE FIVE MONTH INTENSIVE ARE TWENTY DOLLARS FOR THE ENTIRE SERIES. DALY FEES IN THE TRIPLE OUR PROGRAM ARE ROUGHLY EQUIVALENT TO FOUR HOURS OF IN HOME CARE FOR PROGRAM DAY THAT'S OPEN ABOUT TEN AND A HALF AT THE IS OPEN TEN AND A HALF HOURS. AT TRIPLE OR HAS A COMMITMENT TO PROVIDE AT LEAST ONE DAY A WEEK OF SERVICE TO ANY CAREGIVER WHO EXPRESSES THE NEED FOR RESPITE. REGARDLESS OF THEIR ABILITY TO PAY. WE PREFER PROCURE ANNUAL GRANTS FOR SCHOLARSHIP TO HONOR THIS COMMITMENT AND WE ARE ALSO GRATEFUL FOR AS A STRONG PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR LOCAL CARE GIVER RESOURCE CENTER. WE BELIEVE THAT EVERY UNIT OF SERVICE OF ADULT DAY CARE. SERVICE WE PROVIDE WE ARE DIRECTLY AFFECTING THE WELL BEING OF BOTH THE CARE GIVER AND THE OLDER ADULTS WHO ATTENDS OUR PROGRAM. FINELY BECAUSE IT IS A VISION OF TRIPLE ARE THAT ALL PEOPLE WITH DEMENTIA AT FEEL ACCEPTED IN OUR COMMUNITY THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO LAUNCH DEMENTIA FRIENDLY SACRAMENTO AST YEAR. TO PROVIDE DEMENTIA COMMUNICATION TRAINING THE FRONTLINE STAFF AT RETAIL ESTABLISHMENTS RESTAURANTS AND GROCERY STORES TO REDUCE STIGMA AROUND DEMENTIA AND MAKE IT EASIER FOR A CARE GIVER TO INCLUDE THE OLDER ADULT. AND FUN EVENTS AND ACTIVITIES WE'VE ALSO CREATED AN ELDER CARE RESOURCES WORKSHOP THAT IS PROVIDED THROUGH THE CITY SACRAMENTO CITY OF SACRAMENTO HR DEPARTMENT TO EMPLOYEES. AND COULD BE RECKLESS WERE REPLICATED EXCUSE ME. TO OTHER COMPANIES AND ORGANIZATIONS MOST IMPORTANTLY WE ARE PROUD TO SERVE FAMILY CARE GIVERS IN OUR COMMUNITIES TO THE ENTIRE CARE GIVING EXPERIENCE. BEFORE EITHER THEIR CARE GIVERS IF THEY CAN GO TO AN HR. MEETING ALL THE WAY TO THE AND WERE PROVIDING FRONTIER NEW LIFE. INNOVATIVE ADULT DAY PROGRAM SUCH AS TRIPLE OUR EXIST THROUGHOUT THE STATE EVERY PROGRAM IS DIFFERENT AND THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF THE MODEL. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME TODAY AND I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU SO MUCH -- FOR THE WORK YOU DO TO ASSIST OUR FAMILY CARE GIVERS AND THE LOVE ONCE THROUGHOUT THE STATE I JUST HAD -- COUPLE QUESTIONS -- THE FIRST ONE BEING CATHOLIC WAITING LIST -- BUT TO GET HIM A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT KIND OF LIKE. THE NEED IN. WE HAVE SEVERAL DIFFERENT -- THE THREE DIFFERENT SITES ARE -- ON PURPOSE WE PROVIDE DIFFERENT -- OPPORTUNITIES FOR DIFFERENT CLIENTELE WHEN A VERY SITE IS -- ON AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CAMPUS AND IT IS FOR EARLY STAGE MEMORY LOSS. AND THAT PROGRAM IS DOES HAVE A WAITING LIST RIGHT NOW -- THE OTHER TWO SITES -- CAN PROVIDE CARE FOR PEOPLE FROM EARLY STAGE -- ALL THE WAY TO END STAGE THEM AND SOMETIMES IS FULL BUT OFTEN WERE ABLE TO GET PEOPLE AND FAIRLY QUICKLY WE REALLY TRY -- TO ACCOMMODATE PEOPLE AT LEAST ONE DAY A WEEK TO START EVEN IF -- FOR YEAH HAVE A WAITING LIST OF SOME SORT IS A REASON WHY IT KIND OF VARIES FROM ONE WHO. YOU KNOW AT THE WAITING LIST FROM ONE AREA TO ANOTHER OR ONE CENTER -- THEIR EARLY STAGE MEMORY LOSS SITE IS PROBABLY THE MOST IN DEMAND RIGHT NOW WHICH IS LIKELY WHY -- WE HAVE SUCH IN THAT IS WHERE WAITING LIST IS RIGHT NOW AND IT'S ALSO -- WE CAN ACCOMMODATE OF LAGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE AT THE OTHER TWO SITES AND WE REALLY NEED TO LIMIT THE NUMBER. TO TWENTY AT THE EARLY STAGE MEMORY LOSS SITE AND SO -- THAT'S MOSTLY ITS CAPACITY TO BE HONEST YEAH. CHALCOGEN OPENED UP HER COMMITTEE MEMBER SEE THINGS HAVE QUESTIONS. OPTICAL. CENTER PASS UP THANK YOU. I'D YOU'VE YOU MAY HAVE ANY IDEAS I ASKED THIS OF THE I'LL. FIVE AGING. DETAIL OF HIS ANSWERS WAS WELL MAYBE THE LOCAL AREA AGING EMC FAIRLY -- HANDS ON MORE WORK AND ACTION GOT ONE IN FOUR OF FAMILIES WOULD WOULD HAVE A CHARACTER SO BASED ON I'LL GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF ONE OF OUR COUNTIES. ABOUT -- TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND WE'RE HITTING A HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED I'VE I CALCULATED IT POINT ZERO ZERO TWO BEFORE ACTUALLY SERVING. NOW. I THINK THE OTHER POINT THAT WAS BROUGHT OUT IS. IDENTIFIED AS A CARE GIVER IS. IS IS IS KIND OF A NATURAL BARRIER -- YOU SEE SOMEBODY CARING FOR SOMEBODY SAY HEY WE HAVE SERVICES YOU MIGHT WANT TO COME. AND CONSIDER GET HER CARE GIVER SERVICES AND OFTENTIMES WILL GET THE RESPONSE FROM ON WOULD BE OF NO I DON'T NEED ANY SERVICES IT'S MY IT'S MY MOTHER IS MY HOUSE AND THEY NEED TO SERVICES SO SELF IDENTIFICATION IS. IS A HUGE BARRIER TO THIS PROCESS -- SO IT'S SOMETHING I THINK I WOULD I WOULD REALLY CONSIDER AND IN MY EXPERIENCE -- AS THE TRIPLE A DIRECTOR OFTEN MY INTRODUCTION TO CARE GIVERS AS WHEN I HAVE SOMEBODY WALK INTO OUR OFFICE FRANTIC I'M TAKING CARE OF MY MOTHER I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. MODEL MEDI CAL PAY FOR IN HOME CARE SO A COMPLETE LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OF POWER SYSTEMS WORK AND THE FIRST TIME THE EVEN DISCOVER THAT THEY'RE A CARE GIVER. IS ONE IT'S AT THIS CRISIS MOMENT SO. THE CHALLENGE OF IDENTIFIED AS A CARE GIVER IS THE FIRST IDENTIFIED THAT I'M I MEAN THE SITUATION THAT REALLY OST FAMILIES HAVE NEVER PREPARE FOR SEE ALMOST HAVE TO GET OVER THAT INITIAL SHOCK BUT AGAIN I WOULD SAY WE WERE HITTING A VERY SMALL FRACTION. OF THE CARE GIVERS THAT ARE OUT THERE. SO YES THE FOLLOW UP IS IS THAT YOU MENTIONED SMALL FRACTION WE ALSO MENTION THAT PEOPLE DON'T TEND AND THAT A FIGHT SO YES. DO YOU FIND YOURSELF OBVIOUSLY WE NEED WORK TO HELP PEOPLE IDENTIFIED DO YOU FIND YOURSELF WITH. LONG WAITING LISTS ANYWAY THE WAITING WAS QUESTION FOR YEAH ADD VERSES OR IS IT THAT ACTUALLY ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY. SELF IDENTIFY. YOU'RE ABLE TO HELP -- ARE YES IT MOST PEOPLE THAT CALL US THAT IDENTIFIES WE CAN HELP BUT WE OFFER A HUGE MENU OF SERVICES SO RIGHT SOMEONE SAYING I NEED RESPITE THAT MIGHT BE A LIMITED SERVICE. BECAUSE THERE IS LIMITED FUNDS BUT WE CAN ALWAYS PROVIDE FAMILY CONSULTANT TO THEM -- WE DO NUMEROUS EDUCATION AND TRAINING CLASSES THROUGHOUT THE REGION SO YOU COULD BE A FAMILY CARE GIVING CAN. GENERALLY ALWAYS ATTEND ONE OF THOSE COURSE OKAY YOU'RE NOT LIKE COMPLETELY FULL OR THINGS LIKE THAT NO WE CAN GENERALLY ACCOMMODATE YEP PEOPLE IN THOSE COURSES BUT DEFINITELY BUT LET'S SAY IS HEY I REALLY NEED A RESPITE OR INMIGRANTE COUNSELING SERVICES. SOMETHING VERY SPECIFIC -- I I NEED A RAMP PUT INTO MY HOME OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WE MIGHT LIMIT THOSE TYPE OF SERVICES AND REALLY IT COMES DOWN -- TO YOU KNOW THE AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU HAVE FOR WHAT PARTICULAR SERVICES THAT THEY'RE IN NEED OF SO. NOT TRUE WEIGHTLESS IN OUR AREA JUST AND AND HAVE A NICE BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY SINCE THEIR JACKSON'S IN HERE I KNOW SHE SPOKE TO INCHES TALK WE'VE TALKED ABOUT SO JUST ONE SMALL PIECE IS ACTUALLY GETTING PEOPLE TO KIND OF EQUIPMENT FOR THEM TO BE SAFE AT HOME THE STAY. AT HOME -- DEFYING -- YOU -- HAVE GREATER DEMAND FOR THAT DO YOU HAVE FOR PROVIDER -- HOW YEAH WELL I WAS THAT YEAH -- SO SYSTEM DEVICES AND SO RIGHT. BARS ARAMBULA OR OR STUFF LIKE THAT BODY CARE FOR I WOULD SAY UP WHITE NEED A DOORWAY ON RAMP YEAH OUT THERE'S A LOT OF DEMAND FOR THAT AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IF YOU'RE GONNA. WHITE IN A DOORWAY OR NOT A RAMP INTO A HOME AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT ADA COMPLIANCE A CONTRACTOR AND AND THAT TYPE OF STUFF YEAH SO. WE WILL DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN WE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO LOOK AT ALTERNATIVES SO I MEAN OFTENTIMES WE'RE FULL PRESS ON THIS EMPOWERMENT MODEL BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH RESOURCES TO DO EVERYTHING IT'S DEFINITELY NEEDED -- AND WE CAN PUT IT IN BUT WE'RE NOT ABLE TO FULFILL EVERYONE'S RECALLS. SO WHAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL -- THIS WILL TRY TO YOUR ARMS AROUND SOME OF THIS IS THAT. IF THERE'S A WAY FOR THE FIVE AGING THE AGING AGENCIES AND OTHER SO MAYBE AT LEAST COME UP WITH A IF I HAD A ROBUST FUN FOR DISSIDENT VOICES MATERIAL AID RAMPS STORE WAS AND THEN I WOULD ADVERTISE FOR THAT AND SAY IF YOU'RE A CARE GIVER. AND YOU'RE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH YOUR LOVED ONE AND HE NEED TO WIDEN DOORWAY AND YOU NEED A A GRAVEL BAR NAY CHAIR. I CAN PUT IT IN RIGHT NOW I WON'T GO OUT TO THE COMMUNITY AND SAY THAT BECAUSE I WOULD BE INUNDATED AND THEN I WOULD BE TURNING PEOPLE AWAY. SO I WAS A ROBUST FUND FOR THE SERVICE SERVICES I GUESS MY QUESTION TO YOU THAT IS HOW MUCH. SO. IF YOU WANT MY SERVICE -- WILL WITH THE WELL IT'S IS AND WHAT TYPE THE WHOLE YEAH BUT ACTUALLY NO I MEAN THAT'S EXACTLY QUESTION SO SOMETIMES WHAT HAPPENS IS FOR US RIGHT. WE ACTUALLY WOULD LIKE TO KNOW OKAY WELL GIVEN WHAT YOU DAILY TO THE MAN THAT YOU SEE AND MAYBE IT'S AND YOU WON'T SEE ALL OF IT BUT AND HOW MUCH RIGHT I MEAN RIGHT AT THAT SO AT LEAST KNOW WHAT TO AIM FOR ME MID THAT PROVIDE THAT. MUCH BUT AT LEAST HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT THE SCALE IS RIGHT YEAH SURE SO MY SERVICE AREA I WOULD SAY IF I COULD DEDICATE A SOLID TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS I I THINK I COULD. DO IT WITH CONTRACTOR FOR THE TYPE OF WORK YOU DO WHICH ARE RAMPS WIDENING DOORWAYS. BARS ETCETERA NOW THAT'S MY SERVICE AREA -- I IMAGINE LA COUNTY. YEAH. IT MIGHT BE A LOT DIFFERENT LOOK AT AND SAY OKAY WELL YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD IT TAKE OKAY. BUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND MIGHT BE MANAGED. OKAY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. SO WE HAVE A THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I WANNA THANK ALL THE PANELISTS FOR FOR COMING HERE TODAY ON THIS. ISSUE THAT SERVE VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO ME AND AND JOSEPH -- I AM VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE A YEAR SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR BUDGET -- SERVING THE TWO OTHER PEOPLE THAT YOU DEAL WITH IT AS SUCH A LARGE DEGREE GEOGRAPHICAL AREA -- AND I LOVE YOUR ENTHUSIASM AS WELL -- AND SERAPH AYE KILEY SERRA YES YES MISPRONOUNCING SO I PROCEEDED YOUR YOUR PRESENTATION AND WHAT I TOOK AWAY FROM YOUR PRESENTATION IS THAT -- YOU KNOW. SOMETIMES WE HAVE. A PARENT OR AN AUNT THAT -- ULTIMATELY. GETS AL'S ARMORS DISEASE IT DOESN'T -- BECOME -- A SERIES OF ANTI TELL SOMETHING HAPPENS AS AN EXAMPLE MY DAD WAS DIAGNOSED WITH ALZHEIMER'S WITH THE LOS ANGELES RIVERSIDE COUNTY I SOME ABOUT ONCE A MONTH AND SAW THE STEADY. DECLINE -- MY DAD WAS A TEETOTALER BUT ONE OF THE SYMPTOMS OF OF OUTSIDERS IS PEOPLE RESORT TO ALCOHOL SOMETIMES BECAUSE THEY'RE CONFUSED IT KIND OF EASES THEIR CONFUSION. MY DAD WAS DRIVING IN THE CITY OF BELLE DOWN A ONE WAY STREET AND GOT ARRESTED FOR DO YOU WHY IT. IS ALL SO THAT WAS A FLAG TO US THAT OKAY WE KIDS NEED A SAMPLE OF WE NEED. TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO TO TAKE CARE OF OUR PARENTS AND AND WE DID IT AND WE HAVE THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO DO IT MY CONCERN IS WHAT YOU MENTIONED THAT -- MANY PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO. PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET THE SERVICES. AND THERE MAY BE A A LOT OF RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN THE STATE THAT JUST FRANKLY AREN'T BEING USE. AND SO I WAS THINKING. YOU KNOW. PLACES WHERE PEOPLE WITH DEMENTIA -- MAYBE SEE. EMERGENCY ROOMS ASSISTED LIVING CONVALESCENT HOMES. WHAT CAN WE DO BETTER IN THE STATE? EVEN IF IT REQUIRES A REQUIREMENT THAT WHEN YOU SEE SOMEONE THAT IS NOT THE DIAGNOSIS OF OF DEMENTIA AS YOU'RE JUST CHARGING THEM BACK INTO. A RESIDENTIAL ENVIRONMENT. THAT HERE ARE THE SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE. MANY OF WHICH MAY BE FREE OF CHARGE. I DON'T KNOW IF WE CORD DEATH COORDINATE THAT THROUGH COUNTIES BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE NEED. TO NUMBER ONE OVERCOME LANGUAGE BARRIERS AND WE NEED TO WRITE IT IN LAYMAN'S TERMS SO THE PEOPLE THAT MAYBE NOT TECH SAVVY. CAN USE THEIR PHONE -- AND BE ABLE TO GET SOMEONE TO COULD TALK TO THE MIDDLE LEVEL THAT THEY CAN UNDERSTAND. SO THAT THEY CAN EMBRACE THE SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM IN THEIR TIME OF CRISIS SO WHAT COULD WE DO IS A STATE TO BETTER THAT COMMUNICATION TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE FOR YOUNGSTERS OR OLDER PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO SAY I NEED HELP. GRAHAM IS OUT OF CONTROL MOMS OUT OF CONTROL YOU KNOW BY THE ADAM AFRAID HE'S GONNA BURN THE HOUSE DOWN EAGER TO FLAME ON IT DOESN'T TURN HIM OFF IS MAKING ITS MACARONI CHEESE. YEAH WELL WELL THANK YOU SENATOR STAND -- FOR YOU KNOW SO ELOQUENTLY SUMMARIZING THE ISSUE AND I THINK YOU'VE REALLY HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD WHICH IS. A LOT OF THE TIMES THIS ISSUE STARTS IN EITHER THE MEDICAL OFFICE OR IN THE HOSPITAL WHEN PEOPLE ARE WAITING DISCHARGED HOME. OR WHEN A FAMILY MEMBER IS -- WITH THEIR ALZHEIMER'S. WELL DOCTOR WOULD WHY DO AND THE DOCTOR CAN TELL YOU WHAT YOU CAN DO TO CARE FOR YOUR MEDICAL NEEDS BUT MOST OFTEN THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE A CONNECTION TO THE LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS SOCIAL SERVICE ARENA. THAT RIGHT THERE IS A HUGE BARRIER TO HELPING PEOPLE ACCESS THE INFORMATION AND SUPPORTS THEY NEED. I DON'T THINK THERE'S ONE SOLUTION TO THAT PART YET BUT I THINK THAT IT'S THE MORE THAT WE CAN WITH RAISE AWARENESS AWARE ROUND IT AND START TO ENGAGE THE MEDICAL SYSTEM AND HOW TO DEVELOP MORE INTEGRATED SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEMS. THERE CERTAIN DEMONSTRATIONS RIGHT NOW THAT ARE SEEKING TO DO THAT IN THE STATE LIKE THROUGH THE COORDINATED CARE INITIATIVE BUT ULTIMATELY I THINK WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO. BUT JUST I DO WANT TO POINT OUT TO JUST IN THE IN THE FOCUS OF AL SUMMERS GIVEN THAT THAT WAS YOUR EXPERIENCE AS A FAMILY MEMBER. I'M AMAZED BY THE ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATIONS RESOURCE THAT THEY HAVE IT'S AN EIGHT HUNDRED CALL. A ONE EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER THAT YOU CAN USE FROM ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY IF YOU ARE FAMILY MEMBER LIKE YOURSELF. AND YOU HAVE A QUESTION AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START -- YOU CAN ACCESS A TRAINED PERSON ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LINE THAT EITHER CONNECTION DIRECTLY WITH YOUR LOCAL AREA OR IF THEY'RE NOT OPEN. THEY DO A WARM HAND OFF TO YOUR REGIONAL OFFICE AND I KNOW THAT MISS MARK HAS COULD SPEAK VERY WELL TO THIS -- AND THEN THEY CAN DO AN IN HOME ASSESSMENT TO SEE WHAT YOUR LOVED ONE NEEDS IN THE HOME THEY CAN GIVE YOU THE RESOURCES YOU NEED THEY HAVE THE BACK. END TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT SERVICES AND SUPPORTS ARE AVAILABLE IN YOUR AREA TO CONNECT YOU WITH THEY DON'T RECOMMEND ONE OVER THE OTHER BUT THEY HAVE THOSE SORTS OF RESOURCES DO THROUGH WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT SAY THROUGH THE NO WRONG DOOR SYSTEM -- OBVIOUSLY IN CALIFORNIA IT'S HARD BECAUSE WE WOULD HAVE TO RAMP UP A SYSTEM LIKE THAT BUT I DON'T THINK IT HAS TO BE. IMPOSSIBLE AND YOU KNOW THERE ARE STATES SAYS THEY SAID THAT HAVE FIGURE OUT WAYS TO DO THIS WE JUST HAVE TO HAVE THE INTENTION TO DO IT. SO -- BUT I DO THINK THAT. THAT THIS IS AN AREA THAT DESERVES A LOT OF LEADERSHIP AND ATTENTION AND I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT IT'S HIGHLIGHTED BY THE COMMITTEE TODAY. THANK APPREHENSION YOU'RE YOU'RE ANSWERING THE QUESTION AND I WOULD LOVE TO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND SEEING IF WE CAN COME UP WITH SOME STATES LUCIEN'S TO GET THAT INFORMATION OUT. THANK YOU THE INVENTOR. YEAH I HAD A QUESTION -- YOU KNOW EVERY COUNTY HAS LIKE OF MANAGEMENT TO KILL PLAN PROGRAM. HOW WHAT RELATIONSHIP DO YOU HAVE? IN SERVE A COORDINATED SYSTEM OF CARE. NO WRONG DOOR KIND OF MODEL WITH THESE. MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS BECAUSE THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO RIGHT. BUT HOW HOW HOW DO THEY HOW TO THE INVOLVE THEMSELVES. OF THIS ISSUE THE TRIP IT'S A TERRIFIC QUESTION. MEDICAL HELP. RIGHT AS YOU SAID MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE IS IN ALL AREAS ALL COUNTIES OF THE STATE NOW -- SENIORS AND PEOPLE DOES COUNTIES DO A LEGIBLE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE OLDER ADULTS AND WITH -- ARE DUALLY ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE MEDICARE. ARE ONLY REQUIRED TO ENROLL IN MEDICARE MANAGED CARE IN THIS PART OF THIS COORDINATED CARE INITIATIVE BUT T. ANSWER YOUR QUESTION MORE FOCUSED -- IN A MORE FOCUSED WAY -- KILL MANAGED CARE HAS TRADITIONALLY NOT ENGAGED ON ISSUES OF LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORT. IT HASN'T BEEN UNTIL THERE WAS THE SCORE NATIVE KAREN MISSION RIGHT. THAT THEY DO SO AND AND ONE EXCEPTION BEING ACTUALLY THERE SO MANY EXCEPTIONS -- IT IS THE COMMUNITY BASED ADULT SERVICES PROGRAM WHICH IS ACTUALLY. TECHNICALLY A STATEWIDE -- BENEFIT AS PART OF MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE BUT THE CHALLENGES COMMUNITY BASED ADULT SERVICES IS ONLY AVAILABLE IN SAFE THIRTY EIGHT I THIRTY OF THE STATE'S FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. NOT TRULY A BENEFIT AND I COULD GIVE OTHER EXAMPLES BUT LONG STORY SHORT I THINK THAT THERE IS A MOVEMENT TOWARDS HAVING MANAGED. L. T. S. AS THE SOCIAL SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM MORE INTEGRATED WITHIN OUR MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE SYSTEM BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET. AT ALL AND I THINK THERE'S A LOT THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM -- THIS COORDINATED KERR IS ON A US IS YOU'RE ONE OF THE CAN WE HAVE THE RIGHT A SO SO I I'M INTERESTED IN THE CASE WORKER ASSIGNING. YOU KNOW THE WANT YOU TO TALK ABOUT THEM NO WRONG DOOR IT'S KIND OF SOUNDS LIKE ACCORDING CARE. WHERE THEY COME IN AND THEN THERE'S A CASE WORKER THEY PACKAGE SHE? A SAID OF LIKE WHAT WE USED TO CALL WRAPAROUND RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT. KNOWN. AS WE STARTED DOING NOW THE NINETIES YOU KNOW. AND THEN AND THEN WE WE PUT -- THAT SYSTEM TOGETHER COULD BE A MULTI DISCIPLINARY SOCIAL SERVICE THERE MIGHT BE SOME FAMILY SUPPORT PROGRAM. IT BE LIKE A WHOLE PACKAGE FOR NOT JUST THE PATIENT THAT'S A MEDICAL PATIENT WITH THE FAMILY AND MEDICAL. THEN WE INVOLVE THE FAMILY TOGETHER IN THAT. GOING THAT TOGETHER LIKE THE FAMILY SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN THE DISCUSSION ABSOLUTELY -- SO -- IS THAT IS THAT KIND OF A SYSTEM THAT SHOULD BE STATEWIDE -- GOSH I THINK IF WE CAN GET A TRULY PERSON CENTERED SYSTEM OF CARE LIKE THAT THAT LOOKS NOT ONLY AT A PERSON'S MEDICAL NEEDS BUT THE RANGE OF SOCIAL SERVICE. YEAH BECAUSE AS WE KNOW IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT HEALTHCARE IT'S NOT HOUSING IT'S BUT TRANSPORTATION IT'S ABOUT CARE GIVING SUPPORT. THE WHOLE RANGE FOOD SOCIAL PROGRAM ORAL HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH YOU NAME IT -- IT IN AGAIN THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE COORDINATED CARE INITIATIVE BUT I THINK WEARE A WAYS AWAY FROM THAT RIGHT NOW FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. I ALSO THINK A GOOD MODEL AS YOU'RE VERY FOR GET TO THE THE WHOLE WRAPAROUND IN THE MEDICAL SERVICE SIDE IS THE LANHAM ACT BECAUSE THE REGIONAL SO I KNOW YOU'RE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THAT. THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM IS -- YOU KNOW FOR OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES THERE THEY DON'T HAVE A SYSTEM LIKE THAT THAT OFFERS THAT INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT PLANNING AS AN ENTITLEMENT SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT TO LEARN FROM. THE STRENGTH OF THAT SYSTEM IN AND HOW CAN WE HELP. THE BROADER POPULATION AN ACCESS SERVICE YOUR CENTER. LATERAN ACT IS KIND OF LIKE THE MALES KNOWS PRETTY GOOD IT NO STARS. TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE RIGHT THERE STONE I WORK ON THAT OF I HAD I HAD A QUESTION ABOUT INSURANCE COMPANIES -- PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANIES REQUIRED TO BE LICENSED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PROVIDE INSURANCE. AND THEY'RE ALSO REQUIRED TO OBSERVE OUR STATE LAWS AND IF THEY WANT TO LICENSE AFTER OBSERVERS STATE LAWS. AND WE CALL THEM YOU KNOW. SOME PEOPLE CALL THOSE LAWS MANDATES ARE CALM STATE LAWS. YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT AND MANDATE STIR YOU'RE REQUIRED TO FALL A LAW IF YOU WANT TO DO BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA. SO ARE THERE LAWS THAT PROTECT AND PROVIDE FOR THIS KIND OF CARE OR IS THERE ARE. NOT ENOUGH -- SUPPORT. FROM THE LAWS THAT WE HAVE. TO REQUIRE THE INSURANCE COMPANIES PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANIES WILL PROVIDE THE CARE I DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO ANSWER ME. I YEAH I DON'T HAVE. THE ONLY THING THAT I THAT I CAN RELATE TO IT IS LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE WHICH I'M YES A MIST -- NINO WYLER HARLEM HER HER WELL FROM A A. R. P. SPOKE. BUT IN CALIFORNIA SO THAT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE SUPPOSED LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE. THAT'S THEIR FOCUS IS HELPING INDIVIDUALS FINANCE THEIR LONG TERM CARE NEEDS LIKE WE'VE TO DISCUSS TODAY THE CHALLENGES THOSE. THOSE -- MEANT MOST OF THOSE PLANS HAVE BEEN ACTUAR EARLY CHALLENGED I THINK IS ANICE WAY TO PUT IT. AND ONLY ABOUT 5% WE GET THEIR CARE FINANCED BY LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE SO THE MODEL HAS BEEN PROVEN TO BE VERY FINANCIALLY UNSOUND. FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS AND THAT'S WHY IT YOU YOU SEE INITIATIVES LIKETHOSE THAT AREN'T ARE. NOT SO MUCH THE LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE I'M TALKING ABOUT. REGULAR HEALTH INSURANCE YEAH IF I IF I BROTHER OF THESE OF YOU KNOW OVERAGE TO PREVENT THE OR SUPPORT. THE PERSON THAT GOES INTO -- NEED A OF FAMILY CARE GIVER NAY OF WHY I WOULD SAY WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE NOT SEEN IT AND I THINK THE TESTIMONY TODAY WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HER GIVERS WHENEVER WE TALK ABOUT. YOU KNOW MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE OR PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANIES -- CARE GIVERS THERE'S NO SERVICE FOR THEM TO THE INSURANCE COMPANY AND AND SO I THINK THAT'S YOU KNOW THE EMPHASIS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE STATE IS. CARE GIVERS ARE STEPPING UP SO I DON'T KNOW THAT INSURANCE AT THIS TIME I DON'T SEE A PATH THAT INSURANCE IS GOING TO PROTECT CARE GIVERS. AND IS GOING TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES THAT CARE GIVERS NEED AND THAT'S WHAT MOST PEOPLE TESTIFIED HERE TODAY IN THE SERVICES THAT WE OFFER AS CARE GIVER PROGRAMS. IS IT'S FILLING THAT GAP AND I I JUST DON'T SEE IT COMING FROM MANAGER. AND I DON'T SEE IT FROM THE PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANIES AS WELL. CAN AND EVEN THE SUCH IT ASKED THE QUESTION EARLIER HOW. I KNOW LIKE IN OUR AREA WE HAVE MANAGED CARE BUT IT'S NOT AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM IS NOT PART OF CCI WHAT COUNTY ALL WEEK WELL I INTERVIEWED COLUSA GLENN PLUMAS STAINLESS SHASTA LAST MONEX SISKIYOU IN TRINITY ---THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT MANAGED CARE PLANS IN THOSE AREAS AND THEY TRY -- BUT THERE FUNDING ISN'T THERE WE STILL HAVE CHALLENGES WITH PEOPLE GETTING ACCESS TO THE MEDICATION THEY NEED WE HAVE CHALLENGES THAN GETTING TRANSPORTATION SO. I I DON'T THINK WE'RE THERE YET -- BY I THINK WE'RE A LONG WAY OFF THANK YOU. WELL THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND WILL GO AHEAD AND OPEN IT UP NOW TO PUBLIC COMMENTS. SO. FIFTY APPROACH THE MICROPHONE STATE YOUR NAME. AND AFFILIATION AND PLEASE KEEP YOUR TESTIMONY TO TWO MINUTES. THERE IN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DEBBIE TELL IF I AM THE CEO OF TRACING AGING WE'RE AT LONG TERM SUPPORTS AND SERVICES PROVIDER IN. CONTRA COSTA SOLANO NAPA AND SACRAMENTO COUNTIES -- WE PROVIDE ADULT DAY HEALTH CARE THE MULTI PURPOSE SENIOR SERVICES PROGRAM CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY TRANSITIONS PROJECT. AND CARE GIVER SUPPORT -- SERVICES THROUGH SUPPORT GROUPS AND RETREATS AND I JUST WANNA ECHO I'M SO GLAD THAT YOU HAD SERRA HERE AND THE OTHER PANELISTS BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT. YOU'VE GOT A REALLY CLEAR PICTURE OF WHAT SOME OF THE NEEDS ARE AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ASKING ABOUT A HOLISTIC APPROACH THIS BECAUSE MET LIFE STUDIES SHOWED THE IMPACT ON THE VERSE ARE OUT OF WORK BECAUSE THERE CARE GIVING FOR SOMEBODY. I THINK THAT THERE'S A SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM THAT INVOLVES MORE THAN THE GOVERNMENT FIGURING OUT HOW TO TAX PEOPLE BUT HOW TO GET COMMUNITIES AND BUSINESSES TO RECOGNIZE. THE LOSS IN REVENUE AS A RESULT OF THAT AND PARTICIPATE IN HOW WE FIGURE OUT HOW TO HOLISTICALLY COVER WHAT CARE GIVERS NEED AND I WOULD ALSO JUST ECHO. THE NEED FOR HAVING A ONE POINT ENTRY SYSTEM WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT COMPLETELY ECHOES WHAT THE LONG TERM CARE INTEGRATION PROJECT DISCOVERED IN TWO THOUSAND TWO WHICH IS WE NEED A SINGLE POINT OF ENTRY AND SOMEBODY WHO CAN. TRAVEL ALONG WITH US THE WAY LAST YEAR WE GOT -- LEGISLATION PASSED SO THAT CARE GIVERS ARE AT WORK WERE ASKING PATIENTS IF THEY HAVE CARE GIVERS WE NEED TO GO THE NEXT STEP WE NEED TO GET WE NEED TO GET SERVICES TO THE CARE GIVERS TO BE. KEEP PEOPLE LIVING AT HOME LONGER AND HAVE A BETTER APPROACH TO IT AND I AM SO HEARTENED BY THE DISCUSSION THAT HAPPENED TODAY AND I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU -- CAROL SCHOOL I'M THE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA ELDER JUSTICE COALITION AND ALSO STAFF TO THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON AGING. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS HEARING AND JUST TO MAKE NOTE THAT -- KEVIN PRINTABLES THE ONLY PERSON ON YOUR PANELS WHO MENTIONED THE ISSUE OF ELDER ABUSE. AND WHEN USED BEGIN TO LOOK AT DATA ON ELDER ABUSE THE LARGEST PERCENTAGE OF PERPETRATORS ARE FAMILY MEMBERS. AND IF YOU'RE PUTTING PEOPLE IN SITUATIONS WHERE THEY'RE NOT ADEQUATELY TRAINED AND NOT PREPARED AND DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE A CHOICE. YOU ARE SETTING THEM UP FOR FAILURE. AND THAT'S REALLY A CRITICAL THING TO FOCUS ON TO PROVIDE TRAINING. AND WHEN PEOPLE ARE CARE GIVERS AND THEY GET INTO A SITUATION THAT -- IS DANGEROUS. THE PULL THEM OUT AND TO GIVE THEM THE SUPPORTS THAT THEY NEED -- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT CREATING. ELDER ABUSE REGISTRIES AND PENALIZING A LOCKING PEOPLE UP. BUT WHEN THEY'RE NOT PREPARED TO TAKE ON THE JOB THEY REALLY NEED THE SUPPORT AND THE HELP TO TURN THEM AROUND AND I'VE ACTUALLY HEARD ABOUT -- I THINK IT WAS THE A JUDGE INVENTOR OF WHO ACTUALLY HAS SENTENCE -- CARE GIVERS WHO HAVE BEEN OF VIOLENT OR ABUSIVE. TO TRAINING. SO THAT THEY WILL GET WHAT THEY NEED SO THEY CAN. CARE FOR THEIR LOVED ONE APPROPRIATELY AND GET THE CARE THAT THEY NEED. TO SO I HOPE THAT YOU CAN INCORPORATE THIS IN ANY. THOUGHTS THAT YOU HAVE ON GOING IN THAT MAYBE THAT CALIFORNIA OLDER JUSTICE COALITION COULD BE A PART OF THAT DISCUSSION THANK YOU. AFTERNOON EVERYONE -- MANY MISSING MAKE BROOM AND I AM THE PROGRAM MANAGER FOR THE DEL MAR KICK OF A RESOURCE CENTER ONE OF THE ELEVEN RESOURCE CENTERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I WANTED TO COME UP HERE REPRESENT -- MY AGENCY AND MYSELF BECAUSE I AM A MILLENNIAL CARE GIVER -- I'M CARING FOR MY MOTHER WHO WAS MOTHER IN LAW WAS AT KNOWS AND SHE LIVES WITH US AND PART OF THE SANDWICH GENERATION AND CARING FOR A FIVE MONTH OLD. AND SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT -- SENATOR PAN AND CENTER JACKSON HAD ASKED WERE SOLUTIONS HOW CAN WE FIND SOLUTIONS AND AS A PROGRAM MANAGER. I SEE A LOT OF GAPS -- ONE OF THEM IS THE FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TRYING TO FIND A ONE WAY SYSTEM TO IDENTIFY A NETWORK OF REFERRALS. MAYBE THAT. EVERYBODY CAN POINT TOWARDS AND THAT WE CAN -- REFER TO OTHER DIFFERENT AGENCIES RIGHT NOW IT'S A VERY FRAGMENTED SYSTEM AND WHAT I SEE IS WORKING FROM THE MEDICAL PERSPECTIVE IS WE SEE -- THE PILOT SYSTEMS WHERE -- NAVIGATORS ARE SENDING REFERRALS OVER TO US AND WE THEN ARE ABLE TO CATCH THESE. EARLY ARE CARE GIVERS -- WITH EARLY ONSET OF MALE COTTON AS WE GET THOSE ARE CARE GIVERS AND REYES ABLE TO EDUCATE THEM. BUT THE PROBLEM THAT WE ALSO SEE IS THAT THERE'S A BIG GAP WITH MILLENNIAL CARE GIVERS -- MOST OF OUR CLIENTS ARE OLDER CARE GIVER SPOUSAL CAREGIVERS -- WE HAVE -- CARE GIVERS WHO ARE CHILDREN BUT THEY DON'T COME TO A LOT OF OUR SUPPORT GROUP THEY DON'T COME TO OUR EDUCATION AND TRAINING CLASSES EVEN THOUGH IT'S FREE -- BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY -- WE ARE NOT TALKING THE SAME PLATFORM THAT THEY'RE RECEIVING INFORMATION FROM -- AS A MILLENNIAL CARE GIVER I GO TO FACEBOOK I GO TO THE PLATFORMS AND THERE ARE JUST NOT ENOUGH PLATFORMS. ARE CURRENTLY WITHIN OUR OUR SYSTEM R. E. SYSTEM TO BE ABLE TO CATER TO THE WAY THAT THEY NEED INFORMATION. AND I THINK PART OF THE ISSUE IS THAT THEY DON'T AYE DIFFERENT IDENTIFY THEMSELVES AS A CARE GIVER. AND I KNOW THAT. IN AUSTRALIA THEY DID A NATIONWIDE CAMPAIGN WITH ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION WHERE THEY HIRED A CELEBRITY WHO WAS ALSO A CARE GIVER -- AND HE WAS YOUNGER AND HE TALKED ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCE AND IS A NATIONWIDE CAMPAIGN AND IT BROADENED THE AWARENESS AND IT WAS AN INITIATIVE. BY YOU KNOW AUSTRALIA AND ALZHEIMER'S IS A SO I THINK THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT A PREVENTIVE. STANDPOINT AND WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT IT AS YOU KNOW INTEGRATING NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO REACH A YOUNGER DEMOGRAPHIC BECAUSE THEY WE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE GOING TO BE CONTINUING TO PROVIDE CARE. FOR FAMILY MEMBERS SO OUR AGENCY IS ASKING FOR A TEN MILLION DOLLAR FUNDING FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS TO HELP US READ REVAMPS RETOOL OUR PLATFORM. SO THAT WE CAN YOU KNOW PROVIDE ALL THE DIFFERENT NEW SYSTEMS TO INTEGRATE YOU KNOW -- EDUCATION THROUGH MULTI LANGUAGES ACROSS ALL THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES I ALSO THINK THAT PROFESSIONAL AN INFORMAL FAMILY CAREGIVERS SHOULD BE REIMBURSED IN SOME WAY -- RIGHT NOW I JUST US THEY'D BE THERE IS A LACK OF PROVIDERS BECAUSE THEY DON'T GET PAID. HARDLY ANYTHING -- A SO WHY WOULD THEY WANT TO GO AND PROVIDE CARE GIVING WHEN THEY COULD GO TO STARBUCKS AND MAKE SIXTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR. AND THEY'RE GONNA GET BETTER BENEFITS AND CARE GIVING IS A HARD JOB. SO WE NEED TO SOMEHOW REIMBURSE THEM -- WE ALSO NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT MEDI CAL MEDICARE AND THE FUNDING OF LONG TERM CARE PLACEMENT. RIGHT NOW THERE'S A GAP IT'S JUST NOT WORKING EITHER OU MAKE SPEND ON YOUR MONEY AND BE AND POVERTY IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO MEET BE MEDI CAL. SO THAT YOU CAN GET LONG TERM CARE AND THE SOLUTION THERE'S JUST I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SOLUTION IS BUT IT'S NOT THERE -- AND ALSO -- WORKING WITH OUR TRIPLE A.'S. OUT H. C. B. S. REFERRAL SYSTEM SOME SORT OF UNIFIED PERCENT REFERRAL SYSTEM UP. ONE POINT ENTRY SYSTEM THAT IS INTEGRATED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE ENTIRE -- STATE. COUNTY I DON'T NOW TO SOMETHING -- HAVE A BETTER ACCESS FOR ALL OF OUR CLIENTS TO KNOW AND TO BE REFERRED OVER TO OUR AGENCIES LIKE CRC OR ELDER DAY FOR MS AS P. -- THINGS OF THAT NATURE THEM THANK YOU SO MUCH. WHAT WE'VE HEARD A LOT TODAY I THINK YOU FOR THE INFORMATION FOR PROTECT YOUR PARTICIPATION AND TESTIMONY? OF WE WILL. YOUR TICKET BACK TO OUR OFFICES AND CONSIDER HOW BEST TO MOVE FORWARD CLEARLY THE SERVICE THAT FAMILY CAREGIVERS PROVIDE IS INVALUABLE ON A PERSONAL LEVEL TO THE CARE RECIPIENT BUT ALSO ON A SOCIETAL LEVEL. AS WE BUILD A SYSTEM THAT ENABLES OUR AGING ADULTS TO LIVE IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES IN THEIR OWN HOMES. ON THEIR OWN TERMS OTHER MULTIPLE EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF AGING UP POPULATION UNDER WAY INCLUDING DISCUSSIONS TO DEVELOP THE MASTER PLAN ON AGING. THE SENATE HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE WILL ALSO BE FOCUSING ON AGING ISSUES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. INCLUDING POTENTIALLY HOLDEN ADDITIONAL INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS. AS WE'VE HEARD THE SYSTEM OF SUPPORTS FOR OLDER ADULTS IS COMPLICATED IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE. WITH THIS IN MIND I HAVE INTRODUCED US BEFORE FIVE THREE WHICH BOLSTERS THAT NO WRONG DOOR APPROACH TO SERVING OLDER ADULTS AND FAMILY MEMBERS -- NO WRONG DOOR IS THE MODEL USED IN AGING AND DISABILITY RESOURCE CENTERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN CONNECTING OLDER ADULTS TO LOCALLY AVAILABLE SERVICES AND INFORMATION. REGARDLESS OF INCOME OR BENEFIT LEVEL I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AS THIS BILL AND OTHERS -- MOVED TO THE LEGISLATIVE PROCSS PROCESS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE TODAY
