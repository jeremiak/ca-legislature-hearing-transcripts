HOW'S THAT WORK. YEAH YOU DID

00:25:00.565 --> 00:25:01.499
GREAT QUESTION AND IT IS A

00:25:01.566 --> 00:25:04.636
LITTLE BIT OF A COULD A COMPLEX-

00:25:04.703 --> 00:25:06.738
KIND OF MATH PROBLEM AT. THAT IT

00:25:06.805 --> 00:25:08.406
DID THE BASE IS ALWAYS COMES

00:25:08.473 --> 00:25:10.408
FROM THE ARREARS THAT'S REPORTED

00:25:10.475 --> 00:25:13.245
BY A PARTICULAR UTILITY. AND

00:25:13.311 --> 00:25:15.413
OBVIOUSLY WE DID THE INTENT WAS

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:18.149
ALWAYS TO ADDRESS- 1100% A BILL

00:25:18.216 --> 00:25:20.185
RICH FROM PRAIRIE GROUP ONE AND

00:25:20.252 --> 00:25:21.653
ANYTHING THAT REMAINED WHAT WE

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:23.688
CALL WAS WATERFALL DOWN TO EACH

00:25:23.755 --> 00:25:25.690
PRIORITY GROUP. AS THEY COULD BE

00:25:25.757 --> 00:25:28.159
PAID OFF IN FULL. SO THAT THERE

00:25:28.226 --> 00:25:30.929
WAS ALWAYS- THE FIRST BY THE

00:25:30.996 --> 00:25:32.831
HIGHEST LEVEL OF PRAYER YOU PAID

00:25:32.898 --> 00:25:36.101
FOR- WITH THESE DOLLARS. NOW THE

00:25:36.167 --> 00:25:37.702
COMPLEXITY COMES FROM THE FACT

00:25:37.769 --> 00:25:39.638
THAT DIFFERENT UTILITIES WOULD

00:25:39.704 --> 00:25:41.172
HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF A REAR

00:25:41.239 --> 00:25:43.675
AGES AND A DIFFERENT ALLOCATION.

00:25:43.742 --> 00:25:45.243
WHICH THEIR ALLOCATION IS BASED

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:47.746
ON A POLL PERCENT. OF THE-

00:25:47.812 --> 00:25:52.918
REARRANGE. A STATEWIDE. SO SOME

00:25:52.984 --> 00:25:54.185
UTILITIES AGAIN LIKE I HAD

00:25:54.252 --> 00:25:56.488
STATED WOULD BE ABLE TO PAY OFF

00:25:56.554 --> 00:25:58.323
1100% OF PRAIRIE GROUP ONE.

00:25:58.390 --> 00:25:59.891
MOVING A PRAYER GROUP DETENTION

00:25:59.958 --> 00:26:02.093

INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES AS AN

00:26:03.662 --> 00:26:05.697
EXAMPLE. I DID NOT REPORT ANY

PRAYER GROUP ONE UTILITIES

00:26:07.365 --> 00:26:09.034
BECAUSE AS I MENTIONED EARLIER

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:10.602
BECAUSE OF THE MORE MORATORIUMS

00:26:10.669 --> 00:26:12.470
THE DISTRICT YOU SEE. NO

00:26:12.537 --> 00:26:14.406
RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMER WAS FACING

00:26:14.472 --> 00:26:15.874
IMMINENT JUST CONNECTION AT THE

THEN FOR THE INVESTOR OWNED

00:26:21.279 --> 00:26:22.747
UTILITIES WOULD GO DIRECTLY TO

00:26:22.814 --> 00:26:25.784
PRIMARY GROUP TO CUSTOMERS. BUT

ADDRESS A PERCENTAGE OF EACH

CUSTOMER'S BILL AND EACH

00:26:32.724 --> 00:26:34.492
CUSTOMER WOULD RECEIVE THE EXACT

00:26:34.559 --> 00:26:36.828
SAME AMOUNT WHICH WOULD MEAN. IF

00:26:36.895 --> 00:26:42.834
THE ALLOCATION. TO FOR EXAMPLE

00:26:42.901 --> 00:26:45.904
P. GINNY WOULD ONLY HIT. JUST

WHICH MEANS IT IS A ONE CUSTOMER

00:33:14.726 --> 00:33:16.427
ONE APPLICATION APPROACH. AND SO

00:33:16.494 --> 00:33:17.795
ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS WILL BE

00:33:17.862 --> 00:33:19.263
COMING INTO THEIR LOCAL SERVICE

BENEFITS DIRECTLY TO CUSTOMERS

00:33:42.353 --> 00:33:43.621
IT MUST GO TO THE UTILITY

00:33:43.688 --> 00:33:45.857
ITSELF. BUT CENTER HANDED THE

00:33:45.923 --> 00:33:47.492
APPLICATION PROCESS WILL BE

00:33:47.558 --> 00:33:49.127
TARGETED SPECIFICALLY TO LOW

STATEWIDE. OKAY AND- YOUR

00:33:55.333 --> 00:33:56.968
ALLOCATION TO THE DIFFERENT

00:33:57.034 --> 00:33:59.604
AGENCIES IS THAT BASED ON. THE

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:01.572
ESTIMATED PERCENTAGE OF LOW

00:34:01.639 --> 00:34:04.142

ACTUALLY ENDED UP GOING TO AND-

00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:21.058
THE AND SO FORTH OF WE CAN AVAIL

00:34:21.125 --> 00:34:23.428
- THIS- THIS PROGRAM AND AREAS

00:34:23.494 --> 00:34:25.930
FOR IMPROVEMENT. THE

00:34:25.997 --> 00:34:27.298
DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS TO THE

00:34:27.365 --> 00:34:28.499
LOCAL AGENCIES IS GOING TO BE

00:34:28.566 --> 00:34:30.535
BASED ON A SIMILAR OF MULTI

00:34:30.601 --> 00:34:32.670
FACTOR OF FORMULA THAT WE USE

00:34:32.737 --> 00:34:34.338
FOR OUR LIGHT HEAT FUNDS AND SO

00:34:34.405 --> 00:34:36.207
THAT THE DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS

00:34:36.274 --> 00:34:39.677
WHAT WILL BE BASED. A LOT ON IT

00:34:39.744 --> 00:34:41.646
TO THOSE THAT POINTS A NUMBER OF

00:34:41.712 --> 00:34:43.147
LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS THE AREA

AS WELL AS- THE DOLLARS NEEDED

00:34:45.016 --> 00:34:47.452
BY THE AGENCIES SO IT IS A AGAIN

00:34:47.518 --> 00:34:49.921
IT A LITTLE BIT OF A MATH ISSUE

00:34:49.987 --> 00:34:51.589
BUT THE IN AND SINCE WE DON'T

00:34:51.656 --> 00:34:53.691
HAVE THAT SURVEY DATA WERE THAT.

00:34:53.758 --> 00:34:55.293
THAT THE OVERALL CONNECTION WITH

THE WATER UTILITIES- WE WILL BE

00:34:57.628 --> 00:34:59.063
GETTING REPORTING BACK FROM OUR

CUSTOMERS THAT HAVE BEEN SERVED

00:35:02.166 --> 00:35:04.469
UNTIL I WALK PROGRAM. I GUESS

00:35:04.535 --> 00:35:06.237
ONE OTHER QUESTION IS THAT IT IS

00:35:06.304 --> 00:35:07.572
THAT YOU KNOW WHAT THREE

00:35:07.638 --> 00:35:08.639
THOUSAND DIFFERENT THAT'S A SITE

00:35:08.706 --> 00:35:10.308
THAT THE WATER AGENCIES COME IN

00:35:10.374 --> 00:35:11.742
ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT SIZES I

00:35:11.809 --> 00:35:12.910
KNOW JUST FOR MY OWN DISTRICT

00:35:12.977 --> 00:35:15.012
UNITY OF LARGE ONES SAY OF

00:35:15.079 --> 00:35:16.914
SMALLER ONES. AND TO BE FRANK

00:35:16.981 --> 00:35:17.915
WE'VE DEALT WITH THIS BEFORE-

00:35:17.982 --> 00:35:19.517
WATER ISSUES YOU KNOW SOME OF

00:35:19.584 --> 00:35:20.751
THEM ARE MUCH MORE CAPABLE

00:35:20.818 --> 00:35:22.286
ADMINISTRATIVELY THAN OTHERS

00:35:22.353 --> 00:35:24.055
OTHERS HAVE RUN INTO SOME

00:35:24.121 --> 00:35:25.122
CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF THEIR

00:35:25.189 --> 00:35:26.524
ABILITY TO. BUY THEIR SUPPLY

00:35:26.591 --> 00:35:28.025
WATER ARE YOU KNOW IN MINISTER

00:35:28.092 --> 00:35:29.660
THINGS SO IS THAT IS THAT

00:35:29.727 --> 00:35:31.329
PROVING TO BE A CHALLENGE

00:35:31.395 --> 00:35:33.164
BECAUSE I OFTENTIMES ACTUALLY

00:35:33.231 --> 00:35:35.199
SOME OF THE SMALLER ONES. WHICH

00:35:35.266 --> 00:35:37.235
MAY HAVE LESS CAPACITY- FOR

00:35:37.301 --> 00:35:39.470
UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S IN JAIL FOR

00:35:39.537 --> 00:35:41.305
MANAGING THEIR WATER SYSTEMS.

00:35:41.372 --> 00:35:42.907
ALSO TEND THIS ALSO SERVES THE

00:35:42.974 --> 00:35:46.277
LOWEST INCOME. NEIGHBORHOODS SO

00:35:46.344 --> 00:35:48.112
I JUST WONDER AS FAR AS YOUR-

00:35:48.179 --> 00:35:49.547
EXPERIENCE OUR MEDIA

00:35:49.614 --> 00:35:51.015
INTERMEDIARY THAT AGENTS DON'T

00:35:51.082 --> 00:35:54.452
PERSON CONTRACTING WITH- HOW.

00:35:54.519 --> 00:35:55.987
HOW YOU'RE DEALING WITH THAT

00:35:56.053 --> 00:35:58.556
PARTICULAR ISSUE- IT'S- YOU KNOW

00:35:58.623 --> 00:35:59.757
IF YOU'RE GIVING MONEY DIRECTLY

00:35:59.824 --> 00:36:02.393
TO THE AGENCIES- NOW SOME

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:04.428
AGENCIES A SAID HOUSE LESS

00:36:04.495 --> 00:36:10.301
CAPACITY FOR HANDLING. THINGS

00:36:10.368 --> 00:36:11.802
THAN OTHERS. YEAH THIS THE FUNDS

00:36:11.869 --> 00:36:14.372
ARE GOING TO BE- IDENTIFIED BY

00:36:14.438 --> 00:36:16.173
AGENCY BUT YET THEY WILL BE PAID

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:17.542
DIRECTLY TO THE WATER UTILITIES

00:36:17.608 --> 00:36:19.076
THROUGH OUR OUR THIRD PARTY

00:36:19.143 --> 00:36:20.845
IMPLEMENTOR AND IT IS A

00:36:20.912 --> 00:36:22.880
CHALLENGE THAT WE ARE ADDRESSING

00:36:22.947 --> 00:36:24.415
BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO

00:36:24.482 --> 00:36:26.250
ESTABLISH DIRECT PAY AGREEMENTS.

00:36:26.317 --> 00:36:28.986
WITH THREE THOUSAND WATER.

00:36:29.053 --> 00:36:30.755
UTILITIES BUT IT'S SOMETHING

00:36:30.821 --> 00:36:32.523
THAT THE OUR THIRD PARTY

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:33.758
IMPLEMENTOR HAS EXPERIENCE

00:36:33.824 --> 00:36:35.793
DOING- THEY WE FEEL VERY

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:37.328
CONFIDENT THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE

00:36:37.395 --> 00:36:39.196
ABLE TO GET THIS PROGRAM UP AND

00:36:39.263 --> 00:36:41.032

FROM DAY ONE- BUT AGAIN IT IS TO

IMPLEMENTOR- TO ESTABLISH THAT

00:36:55.246 --> 00:36:56.681

HAD THEIR SERVING COMMUNITIES

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:20.338
THERE- PARTICULARLY

00:37:20.404 --> 00:37:22.506
DISADVANTAGED- WE WILL FIGURE

00:37:22.573 --> 00:37:24.308

THOSE CUSTOMERS ARE HEALTH SO

00:37:27.278 --> 00:37:28.479

UP AND DOWN IN THE VALLEY WHERE

00:38:07.251 --> 00:38:10.187
WE HAVE. JUST INCREDIBLY HIGH-

00:38:10.254 --> 00:38:12.623
LACK OF WATER AND VERY HIGH

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:14.692
HEATS WHERE PEOPLE. HAVE NO

PROGRAMS. WELL FOR THE FOR CAP-

00:38:33.944 --> 00:38:36.013
THE IT WAS JUST BASICALLY THAT

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:37.281
THE TOTAL REAR RIDGE BY

UTILITIES SO KNOW THAT THOSE

00:38:39.383 --> 00:38:40.851
ISSUES WERE TAKEN- CAL BUT I

00:38:40.918 --> 00:38:41.919
THINK THAT THEY WOULD JUST

00:38:41.986 --> 00:38:44.522
NATURALLY BE PART OF THE MATH

00:38:44.588 --> 00:38:45.723
THAT WOULD COME INTO IT THE

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:47.091
HIGHER ARREARS DOLLARS WOULD BE

00:38:47.158 --> 00:38:48.459

UTILITIES MORE- IN HIGH HEAT-

00:38:52.697 --> 00:38:54.899
SCENARIOS. AS FAR AS LIKE WHAT

00:38:54.965 --> 00:38:58.235
THE FACTORS IN DETERMINING THE

NUMBERS GOING TO THE AGENCIES

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:01.005
WILLINCLUDE THE INCOME

00:39:01.072 --> 00:39:02.907
POPULATION AND THEN THE WATER

00:39:02.973 --> 00:39:05.943
COST SO- THOSE INS DOES AREAS

00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:07.278
THAT MAY HAVE HIGHER INSTANCES

00:39:07.344 --> 00:39:10.314
OF- THE COST JUST TO GET WATER

00:39:10.381 --> 00:39:13.184
MAIN NECESSARILY- RECEIVED A- A

00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:15.286
LARGER ALLOCATION AND AT THE

00:39:15.352 --> 00:39:16.554
ABILITY TO HAVE A POTENTIALLY

00:41:37.761 --> 00:41:38.362
THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY MOVING

00:41:38.429 --> 00:41:40.831
FORWARD AT FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE.

00:41:40.898 --> 00:41:43.300
THERE ARE ASERIES OF QUESTIONS

00:41:43.367 --> 00:41:44.501
THAT YOU HAD ON THIS PARTICULAR

00:41:44.568 --> 00:41:48.138
PIECE- WHAT IS ONE OCCURRENCE OF

00:41:48.205 --> 00:41:49.974
COURT- WHEN I PASSED THROUGH ALL

00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:57.748
OF. TRANSIT ON FOR FIRST THE

00:41:57.815 --> 00:41:58.716
SYSTEM FAMILY. NO THREE MAY

00:41:58.782 --> 00:41:59.650
REASON WHY THAT THAT'S BEEN

00:41:59.717 --> 00:42:00.885
CHALLENGING THE FIRST IS- WE HAD

00:42:00.951 --> 00:42:02.753
A MOVED WITH THE- FOR. TO GO TO

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:03.888
ONE HUNDRED HUNDRED DOLLAR. AND

00:42:03.954 --> 00:42:05.222
THE START OF YEAR. AND JUST

00:42:05.289 --> 00:42:06.757
PIECE IS WE DO NOT HAVE THAT

00:42:06.824 --> 00:42:08.525
AUTHORITY TO GO ABOUT THAT SO IF

00:42:08.592 --> 00:42:10.628
WE WERE TO MAKE THE DECISION TO

00:42:10.694 --> 00:42:12.196
PASS THROUGH. AND THE ADDITIONAL

00:42:12.263 --> 00:42:13.230
HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS

00:42:13.297 --> 00:42:14.665
FOR CURRENTLY ASSISTED FAMILIES

00:42:14.732 --> 00:42:15.766
WE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE THE

00:42:15.833 --> 00:42:17.234
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HOLES FOR

00:42:17.301 --> 00:42:18.168
THEIR 50% OF THE SHARES

00:42:18.235 --> 00:42:19.803
RECOLLECTION SO. THERE'S AN

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:21.038
ADDED IMPACTS TO THE STATE'S

00:42:21.105 --> 00:42:22.573
BUDGET. AND TO MAKE THEIR OWN

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:23.974
GOVERNMENT HOLE THERE IS A

00:42:24.041 --> 00:42:25.042
DISCUSSION FEDERAL LEVEL ABOUT

00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:26.143
WHETHER THAT'S GOING TO BE

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:29.179
CHANGED ON THE ROAD BUT THEY'RE

00:42:29.246 --> 00:42:29.980
NOT QUITE THERE YET. AND THEN

00:42:30.047 --> 00:42:32.082
THE THIRD PIECE- ON THIS.

00:42:32.149 --> 00:42:35.286
CONCEPT ABOUT. MOVING TO CURRENT

00:42:35.352 --> 00:42:36.587
PASSED THROUGH ALL TRANSPORT

00:42:36.654 --> 00:42:38.322
REALLY HAS TO DO WITH OUR

00:42:38.389 --> 00:42:38.856
SYSTEMS ITSELF WE JUST

00:42:38.923 --> 00:42:40.291
IMPLEMENTED ONE AND TWO HUNDRED

00:42:40.357 --> 00:42:41.191
WE REALLY WANT TO SEE THE

00:42:41.258 --> 00:42:43.460
IMPACTS OF THAT AND THE FACT IT

00:42:43.527 --> 00:42:44.728
HAS ON THE FAMILY WE- TO GO

00:42:44.795 --> 00:42:46.230
ABOVE AND BEYOND THAT WE WOULD

00:42:46.297 --> 00:42:47.197
HAVE TO GO INTO FRTHER

00:42:47.264 --> 00:42:48.799
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT

00:42:48.866 --> 00:42:50.100
WE JUST REGARD WHEN IT COMES TO

00:42:50.167 --> 00:42:51.669
OTHER TYPES OF SERVICES ON THE

00:42:51.735 --> 00:42:53.370
PARCEL SERVICES SIGN. AND THEN

00:42:53.437 --> 00:42:54.271
JUST FRONT TECHNOLOGICAL

00:42:54.338 --> 00:42:55.873
PERSPECTIVE WHICH PARCEL SERVICE

00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:57.308
IS GOING TO THEIR MAJOR OVERHAUL

00:42:57.374 --> 00:42:58.709
AND SYSTEMS WE DON'T FEEL WE

00:42:58.776 --> 00:43:00.311
WOULD BE ABLE TO GET TO THIS AND

00:43:00.377 --> 00:43:01.912

00:44:50.354 --> 00:44:52.256
THIS IS ATTRIBUTED TO A NET ZERO

00:44:52.322 --> 00:44:54.124
SHIFT OF ASSISTANCE QUESTIONS TO

00:45:22.519 --> 00:45:23.954
THIS IS JACKIE BRISTOW WITH THE

00:45:24.021 --> 00:45:26.023
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE-

00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:27.024
WE'RE STILL WORKING ON

00:45:27.091 --> 00:45:28.892
FINALIZING OUR ANALYSIS OF THE

00:45:28.959 --> 00:45:30.461
CHILD SUPPORT BUDGET BUT I CAN

00:45:30.527 --> 00:45:31.929

REGARDS TO THE PAST THROUGH

00:45:35.933 --> 00:45:38.001
PROPOSAL. GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

00:45:38.068 --> 00:45:40.204
PROPOSAL REFLECTS ONE PASTOR

00:45:40.270 --> 00:45:42.773
OPTION WHERE THE STATE DOES WAS

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:43.941
PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED WOULD

00:45:44.007 --> 00:45:45.709
MAXIMIZE THE FEDERAL FLEXIBILITY

00:45:45.776 --> 00:45:47.244
WHEN IT COMES TO THE PASTOR

00:45:47.311 --> 00:45:49.746
AMOUNT FOR FORMER CAL WORKS%

00:45:49.813 --> 00:45:51.281
FAMILIES OR FAMILIES THAT

00:45:51.348 --> 00:45:53.717
PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED CAL WORKS-

00:45:53.784 --> 00:45:55.486
COULD TEND TO BE LOW INCOME

00:45:55.552 --> 00:45:58.055
FAMILIES I'M ALTERNATIVE POP

00:45:58.122 --> 00:46:00.190
THROUGH OPTIONS INCLUDE

00:46:00.257 --> 00:46:01.492
INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF CHILD

00:46:01.558 --> 00:46:03.093
SUPPORT PAYMENTS FOR CURRENT CAL

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:04.294
WORKS FAMILIES THOSE THAT ARE

00:46:04.361 --> 00:46:06.396
CURRENTLY RECEIVING- CAL WORKS

00:46:06.463 --> 00:46:08.332
CASH EIGHT ALTERNATELY WE

00:46:08.398 --> 00:46:09.399
BELIEVE THAT THE PASSED THROUGH

00:46:09.466 --> 00:46:11.135
FRAMEWORK THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:46:11.201 --> 00:46:12.703
DOCKS SHOULD REALLY REFLECT ITS

00:46:12.769 --> 00:46:15.172
OWN GOALS. I'M FOR EXAMPLE IF

00:46:15.239 --> 00:46:16.507
THE LEGISLATURE WANTED TO

00:46:16.573 --> 00:46:18.342
MINIMIZE THE PAST THEIR

00:46:18.408 --> 00:46:19.977
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CURRENT AND

00:46:20.043 --> 00:46:22.012
FORMER CAL WORKS FAMILIES WELL

00:46:22.079 --> 00:46:24.248
AT THE SAME TIME MAXIMIZE THE

00:46:24.314 --> 00:46:25.682
NUMBER OF LOW INCOME CHILDREN

00:46:25.749 --> 00:46:26.783
AND FAMILIES THAT RECEIVE

00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:28.819
ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS IT COULD

00:46:28.886 --> 00:46:30.521
INCREASE PASSED THROUGH LEVELS

00:46:30.587 --> 00:46:34.691
FOR BOTH FORMER. AND CURRENT CAL

00:46:34.758 --> 00:46:35.259
WORKS FAMILIES. OF SOMETHING

00:46:35.325 --> 00:46:36.760
THAT THE- WE NEED TO CONSIDER

00:46:36.827 --> 00:46:38.996
WHAT THAT POLICY OPTION WOULD BE

00:46:39.062 --> 00:46:40.564
HOW QUICKLY THE PASTOR CHANGES

00:46:40.631 --> 00:46:42.633
COULD BE IMPLEMENTED AS WAS

00:46:42.699 --> 00:46:44.401
MENTIONED ANY PASTOR CHANGES FOR

00:46:44.468 --> 00:46:46.270
CRYING CAL WORKS FAMILIES. COULD

00:46:46.336 --> 00:46:47.938
NOT BE IMPLEMENTED UNTIL

00:46:48.005 --> 00:46:50.040
SOMETIME IN TWENTY FOUR TWENTY

00:46:50.107 --> 00:46:51.775
FIVE JUST DUE TO LIMITATIONS ON

00:46:51.842 --> 00:46:54.044
IT SYSTEMS RIGHT NOW HOWEVER

00:46:54.111 --> 00:46:55.445
THAT COULD GIVE THE LEGISLATURE

00:46:55.512 --> 00:46:57.714
TIME SOME TIME TO CONSIDER. I'M

00:46:57.781 --> 00:46:59.316
SOME OF THESE OTHER PROGRAMMATIC

00:46:59.383 --> 00:47:02.152
IMPLICATIONS- SUCH AS WHAT. AN

00:47:02.219 --> 00:47:03.387
INCREASING CURRENT PASSED

00:47:03.453 --> 00:47:06.156
THROUGH- FOR POWER EXPAND THESE

00:47:06.223 --> 00:47:07.357
WOULD MEAN FOR THEIR CHARACTER

00:47:07.424 --> 00:47:09.059
ELIGIBILITY OR ELIGIBILITY AND

00:47:09.126 --> 00:47:11.428
OTHER SOCIAL SERVICES PROGRAMS.

00:47:11.495 --> 00:47:13.263
ADDITIONALLY OF COURSE THE

00:47:13.330 --> 00:47:15.165
LEGISLATURE- WE NEED TO CONSIDER

00:47:15.232 --> 00:47:17.100
IT BE INCREASE AN ESTIMATED

00:47:17.167 --> 00:47:19.636
GENERAL FUND IMPACT. AND OVERALL

00:47:19.703 --> 00:47:21.138
WE ARE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF

00:47:21.205 --> 00:47:22.706
ASSESSING THE COST ESTIMATES FOR

00:47:22.773 --> 00:47:24.541
EACH OF THE COSTS ARE EACH OF

00:47:24.608 --> 00:47:25.709
THE PAST THROUGH OPTIONS

00:47:25.776 --> 00:47:27.144
INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR'S. BUDGET

00:47:27.211 --> 00:47:29.580
PROPOSAL I'M JUST SOMETHING THAT

00:47:29.646 --> 00:47:31.415
WE WOULD FLAG IS BECAUSE WE

00:47:31.481 --> 00:47:33.584
CAN'T NECESSARILY GO OFF THE-

00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:35.719
PASTOR CURRENT COST LEVELS ARE

00:47:35.786 --> 00:47:36.787
COLLECTION LEVELS BECAUSE WE

00:47:36.853 --> 00:47:39.556
KNOW THAT- DOES TEND TO INCREASE

00:47:39.623 --> 00:47:41.024
OR DECREASE WITH CAL WORKS

00:47:41.091 --> 00:47:44.328
CASELOAD LEVELS- WHICH WE- WERE

00:47:44.394 --> 00:47:48.131
ESTIMATING. ARE JUST GOING TO

00:47:48.198 --> 00:47:48.899
INCREASE IN THE FUTURE. I'M

00:47:48.966 --> 00:47:51.235
MOVING ON TO THE- PROPOSAL FOR

00:47:51.301 --> 00:47:53.670
THE INCREASED FUNDING ALLOCATION

00:47:53.737 --> 00:47:55.005
TO LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES

00:47:55.072 --> 00:47:57.274
ADMINISTRATIVE FUNDING LEVELS WE

00:47:57.341 --> 00:47:59.176
CONTINUE TO HAVE CONCERNS WITH

00:47:59.243 --> 00:48:00.877
THE ADMINISTRATION'S FUNDING

00:48:00.944 --> 00:48:03.513
METHODOLOGY. AND THAT IT DOES

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:05.382
NOT FULLY INCENTIVIZE THE

00:48:05.449 --> 00:48:07.718
ADOPTION OF PROGRAM EFFICIENCIES

00:48:07.784 --> 00:48:09.286
THAT COULD ALSO HAVE THE EFFECT

00:48:09.353 --> 00:48:10.988
OF REDUCING COST PRESSURES AND

00:48:11.054 --> 00:48:13.290
FREE UP EXISTING BONDS. MORE

00:48:13.357 --> 00:48:15.592
OVER WE HAVE A CONCERN THAT THE

00:48:15.659 --> 00:48:17.661
FUNDING METHODOLOGY I MAY NOT

00:48:17.728 --> 00:48:20.130
REFLECT ACTUAL FUNDING NEEDS.

00:48:20.197 --> 00:48:21.932
I'M GIVEN THAT PROGRAM UP FOR

00:48:21.999 --> 00:48:24.334
OPERATIONS HAVE ANY CONTINUED TO

00:48:24.401 --> 00:48:26.837
MOVE FURTHER AWAY FROM TWO

00:48:26.903 --> 00:48:27.404
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN OPERATION

00:48:27.471 --> 00:48:29.206
LEVELS. WHICH SERVE AS THE

00:48:29.273 --> 00:48:31.208
BENCHMARK WHEN CALCULATING

00:48:31.275 --> 00:48:33.110
OVERALL LCSC FUNDING NEEDS

00:48:33.176 --> 00:48:35.912
WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION'S

00:48:35.979 --> 00:48:36.980
FUNDING METHODOLOGY. THUS I'M

00:48:37.047 --> 00:48:38.415
EVEN IF THE FUNDING METHODOLOGY

00:48:38.482 --> 00:48:40.951
WAS DEEMED APPROPRIATE AND

00:48:41.018 --> 00:48:42.619
TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY- THERE'S

00:48:42.686 --> 00:48:44.588
NO CERTAINTY THAT IT CONTINUES

00:48:44.655 --> 00:48:45.922
TO ACCURATELY MEASURE CURRENT

00:48:45.989 --> 00:48:48.392
AND FUTURE LCSC ADMINISTRATIVE

00:48:48.458 --> 00:48:51.061
FUNDING NEEDS. WITH THAT SAID

00:48:51.128 --> 00:48:52.029
AND WE RECOMMEND THAT THE

00:48:52.095 --> 00:48:53.563
LEGISLATURE NOT PROVIDE ANY

00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:54.865
FUTURE ON TUESDAY FUNDING

00:48:54.931 --> 00:48:56.433
INCREASES UNTIL THE

00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:57.901
ADMINISTRATION REVISES ITS

00:48:57.968 --> 00:48:59.803
FUNDING METHODOLOGY TO ADDRESS

00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:01.905
THESE IDENTIFIED SHORTCOMINGS.

00:49:01.972 --> 00:49:03.006
SOME CHANGES THAT ARE PRETTY

00:49:03.073 --> 00:49:04.274
STRAIGHT FORWARD THAT COULD BE

00:49:04.341 --> 00:49:05.909
ADDED TO THE FUNDING METHODOLOGY

00:49:05.976 --> 00:49:08.111
RELATIVELY QUICKLY INCLUDE

00:49:08.178 --> 00:49:09.379
LIMITING THE COST OF DOING

00:49:09.446 --> 00:49:11.548
BUSINESS ADJUSTMENTS ON THAT ARE

00:49:11.615 --> 00:49:12.482
INCLUDED IN THE FUNDING

00:49:12.549 --> 00:49:14.584
METHODOLOGY TO A FIXED RATE AS A

00:49:14.651 --> 00:49:16.086
WAY TO CONTROL THE STATE SHARE

00:49:16.153 --> 00:49:18.689
COST- FOR COUNTY CONTROLLED

00:49:18.755 --> 00:49:20.524
SALARY AND BENEFIT INCREASES

00:49:20.590 --> 00:49:22.759
AND- SUCH CONTROLS. AND THE

00:49:22.826 --> 00:49:25.062
STATE SHARE COST ARE COMMON IN

00:49:25.128 --> 00:49:26.596
OTHER PROGRAMS THAT ARE

00:49:26.663 --> 00:49:27.164
ADMINISTERED AT THE COUNTY

00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:29.132
LEVEL. ADDITIONALLY ANOTHER

00:49:29.199 --> 00:49:32.969
POSSIBLE CHANGE- COULD BE TO ADD

00:49:33.036 --> 00:49:35.772
ON A ONGOING PROCESS AND WHICH

00:49:35.839 --> 00:49:38.241
BUDGETS ARE UNDERFUNDED- OF

00:49:38.308 --> 00:49:41.211
OVERFUNDED LCCS MEETING LCCS

00:49:41.278 --> 00:49:43.080
THAT HAVE ACCESS FUNDS ABOVE

00:49:43.146 --> 00:49:46.917
THEIR CALCULATED FUNDING NEEDS

00:49:46.983 --> 00:49:48.919
CERTAIN TIME PERIOD AND THEN

00:49:48.985 --> 00:49:49.886
THOSE EXCESS FUNDS ARE

00:49:49.953 --> 00:49:51.755
REDISTRIBUTED TO UNDERFUNDED

00:49:51.822 --> 00:49:57.561
ALSEA. SA- I'M HAPPY TO GO TO DO

00:49:57.627 --> 00:49:58.595
. I'M MORE DE ABOUT THE SUPER

00:49:58.662 --> 00:50:00.497
BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT- KRISTIN

00:50:00.564 --> 00:50:01.631
FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF CHILD

PRESENT. ON THE TRAILER BILL

00:50:04.935 --> 00:50:06.403
LANGUAGE AND OUR INITIAL HIGH

00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:08.171
LEVEL COMMENTS ON THAT WAS WE'RE

00:50:08.238 --> 00:50:09.673
STILL REVIEWING IT WAS JUST

00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:11.375
RELEASED ON FRIDAY BUT TWO

00:50:11.441 --> 00:50:12.442
THINGS WOULD FLAG FOR THE

00:50:12.509 --> 00:50:15.679
LEGISLATURE NOW IS- REQUESTING A

00:50:15.746 --> 00:50:17.180
SUMMARY OF THIS STAKEHOLDER

00:50:17.247 --> 00:50:19.049
FEEDBACK THAT WAS COLLECTED BY

00:50:19.116 --> 00:50:20.784
THE DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT

00:50:20.851 --> 00:50:22.219
SERVICES- AND JUST REQUESTING

00:50:22.285 --> 00:50:24.654
INFORMATION ON HOW THOSE- ON HOW

00:50:24.721 --> 00:50:25.989
THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE DOES OR

00:50:26.056 --> 00:50:27.758
DOES NOT. ADDRESS THOSE

00:50:27.824 --> 00:50:28.725
STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK THAT CAME

00:50:28.792 --> 00:50:31.261
UP- BUT ALSO ONE THING THAT WE

00:50:31.328 --> 00:50:32.396
WILL BE LOOKING FOR IN THE

00:50:32.462 --> 00:50:34.398
LANGUAGE IS IDENTIFYING WHETHER

00:50:34.464 --> 00:50:36.666
THERE ARE CERTAIN AREAS WHERE IT

00:50:36.733 --> 00:50:38.735
MAKES SENSE FOR THE LEGISLATURE

00:50:38.802 --> 00:50:40.737
TO ADOPT MORE DETAILED LANGUAGE.

00:50:40.804 --> 00:50:43.173
AROUND THE NEW CRITERIA THAT CAN

00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:44.541
BE CONSIDERED WHEN ESTABLISHING

00:50:44.608 --> 00:50:46.410
A CHILD SUPPORT ORDER AND THIS

00:50:46.476 --> 00:50:48.044
IS MORE FOR THE PURPOSES OF

00:50:48.111 --> 00:50:51.615
ENSURING STANDARDISED APPROACH-

00:50:51.681 --> 00:50:52.816
AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE

00:50:52.883 --> 00:50:56.787
CRITERIA FOR ALL FAMILIES ACROSS

00:50:56.853 --> 00:50:58.755
THE STATE. THANK YOU. I THANK

00:50:58.822 --> 00:51:03.226
YOU VERY MUCH- TRUE DON'T STEP

00:51:03.293 --> 00:51:05.962
BACK BUDGET JUST TO SEE WITH YOU

00:51:06.029 --> 00:51:08.198
EARLIER- THE WOMAN TARA FOR THE

00:51:08.265 --> 00:51:10.133
PASSED THROUGH. WE'RE TALKING

00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:12.502
ABOUT THERE ARE BASICALLY TWO

00:51:12.569 --> 00:51:14.037
TWO PARTS OF FAMILIES ON CAL

00:51:14.104 --> 00:51:16.106
WORKS A POST CAL WORKS. ON

00:51:16.173 --> 00:51:17.607
EITHER LEVEL OF THOSE AND I

00:51:17.674 --> 00:51:18.308
UNDERSTAND THAT THE

00:51:18.375 --> 00:51:19.943
COMPLICATIONS OF TRYING TO GIVE

00:51:20.010 --> 00:51:21.077
IT TO PEOPLE WHO ARE CURRENTLY

00:51:21.144 --> 00:51:22.446
ON CAL WORKS BUT ARE WE LOOKING

00:51:22.512 --> 00:51:25.048
AT LEVEL OF NEED FOR THE AMOUNT

00:51:25.115 --> 00:51:26.550
OF THAT PASSED THROUGH OR OR

00:51:26.616 --> 00:51:28.118
THEY'RE PRIORITIZING. PEOPLE

00:51:28.185 --> 00:51:29.719
WITH HIGHER LEVEL OF NEEDS OR IS

00:51:29.786 --> 00:51:31.021
THERE JUST NOT THE DATA TO BE

00:51:31.087 --> 00:51:34.257
ABLE TO DO THAT LEVEL OF.

00:51:34.324 --> 00:51:38.261
CRITERIA. MY UNDERSTANDING OF

00:51:38.328 --> 00:51:40.964
HOW THE- PROPOSAL FOR A BI

00:51:41.031 --> 00:51:43.033
INCREASING PASTOR FOR FORMER CAL

00:51:43.099 --> 00:51:46.703
WORKS FAMILIES. IS IT WE HAVE TO

00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:48.338
TREAT ALL FAMILIES WELL IT'S

00:51:48.405 --> 00:51:49.506
KIND OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:51:49.573 --> 00:51:50.640
THEIR CONDITION IS IF YOU'RE

00:51:50.707 --> 00:51:52.108
GOING TO. INCREASE THE PASSED

00:51:52.175 --> 00:51:54.277
THROUGH YOU HAVE TO DO IT

00:51:54.344 --> 00:51:57.314
EQUALLY- SO IF YOU'RE IF IT WILL

00:51:57.380 --> 00:51:59.082
WILL BE WILLING TO FORGIVE OUR

00:51:59.149 --> 00:52:00.517
SHARE OF THAT PAYMENT IF THE

00:52:00.584 --> 00:52:01.852
STATE DOES THE SAME AND THEY

00:52:01.918 --> 00:52:03.220
PASSED THROUGH THE EXACT SAME

00:52:03.286 --> 00:52:06.089
AMOUNT TO FAMILIES- HOWEVER IN

00:52:06.156 --> 00:52:07.791
YOUR CONVERSATIONS ABOUT MAYBE

00:52:07.858 --> 00:52:09.059
HOW DO CURRENT. CAL WORKS

00:52:09.125 --> 00:52:10.694
FAMILIES COMPARED TO FORMER CAL

00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:12.863
WORKS FAMILIES. BOTH ARE LOW

00:52:12.929 --> 00:52:16.533
INCOME. HOWEVER BASED OFF OF.

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:18.001
INCOME DATA THAT WE RECEIVED

00:52:18.068 --> 00:52:19.703
FROM THAT- DEPARTMENT OF CHILD

00:52:19.769 --> 00:52:21.505
SUPPORT SERVICES A FEW YEARS AGO

00:52:21.571 --> 00:52:23.306
IT DOES SEEM LIKE. CURRENT CAO

00:52:23.373 --> 00:52:25.642
WORKS FAMILIES TEND TO BE ANY

00:52:25.709 --> 00:52:28.178
WORSE ECONOMIC POSITION-

00:52:28.245 --> 00:52:29.779
RELATIVE TO FORMER CAL WORKS

00:52:29.846 --> 00:52:32.949
FAMILIES- AND IN IN THE IN THE

00:52:33.016 --> 00:52:34.618
CASE OF FORMER CAL WORKS

00:52:34.684 --> 00:52:36.419
FAMILIES. OF THE OF THE CARE OF

00:52:36.486 --> 00:52:37.854
THE FAMILIES THAT WOULD BENEFIT

00:52:37.921 --> 00:52:39.789
UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL.

00:52:39.856 --> 00:52:41.625
AND MANY OF THEM NO LONGER HAVE

00:52:41.691 --> 00:52:43.226
AN ACTIVE CHILD SUPPORT ORDER IN

00:52:43.293 --> 00:52:45.328
PLACE AND THAT COULD BE A SIGN

00:52:45.395 --> 00:52:46.897
THAT. THE CHILD HAS ALREADY

00:52:46.963 --> 00:52:48.732
REACHED ADULTHOOD. AND THAT

00:52:48.798 --> 00:52:50.200
MAKES SENSE BECAUSE THE TYPES OF

00:52:50.267 --> 00:52:51.167
PAYMENTS THAT WOULD GO TO

00:52:51.234 --> 00:52:53.503
FAMILIES TYPICALLY ARE THE LAST.

00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:55.238
PAYMENTS THE LAST BUCKET BUT

00:52:55.305 --> 00:52:57.574
GETS PAID IN ALL CASES. I'M SO

00:52:57.641 --> 00:52:58.808
THE CHILD POSSIBLY HAS ALREADY

00:52:58.875 --> 00:53:00.377
REACHED ADULTHOOD BY THE TIME.

00:53:00.443 --> 00:53:02.546
THOSE PAYMENTS ARE BEING MADE-

00:53:02.612 --> 00:53:04.080
VERSES WITH THE CURRENT COVERAGE

00:53:04.147 --> 00:53:05.282
FAMILY WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A

00:53:05.348 --> 00:53:07.350
CHILD IN THAT HOUSEHOLD TODAY.

00:53:07.417 --> 00:53:08.418
I'M SO DEPENDING ON THE

00:53:08.485 --> 00:53:10.020
LEGISLATURE'S CALLS YOU CAN

00:53:10.086 --> 00:53:11.655
STRUCTURE IN A WAY WHERE PERHAPS

00:53:11.721 --> 00:53:13.924
YOU ARE. PRIORITIZING ARE

00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:15.625
BENEFITING FAMILIES THAT YOU

00:53:15.692 --> 00:53:18.428
DEEM ARE EITHER IN A MORE NEED

00:53:18.495 --> 00:53:19.963
RELATIVE I BASED OFF OF THEIR

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:21.932
RELATIVE ECONOMIC SITUATION OR

00:53:21.998 --> 00:53:23.967
RELATIVE TO THE FAMILY THE

00:53:24.034 --> 00:53:25.068
HOUSEHOLD COMPOSITION AS THEIR

00:53:25.135 --> 00:53:30.907
CHILD- IN THE HOUSEHOLD X.

00:53:30.974 --> 00:53:31.875
SENTARA. OKAY THANK YOU VERY

00:53:31.942 --> 00:53:33.443
MUCH IS THAT VERY HELP- DIRECTOR

00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:38.315
DAVID ON THE L. CSA FUNDING- ARE

00:53:38.381 --> 00:53:39.583
YOU LOOKING AT DIFFERENT SORTS

00:53:39.649 --> 00:53:41.885
OF OBJECTIVES TO BE ABLE TO.

00:53:41.952 --> 00:53:44.921
MAKE THOSE DECISIONS. YES THEY

00:53:44.988 --> 00:53:47.390
ARE OUR FIRST INITIATIVE- WHAT

00:53:47.457 --> 00:53:48.425
THEY OUGHT TO STAY FUNDING WAS

00:53:48.491 --> 00:53:49.593
TO BRING PARITY TO ALL THE LOCAL

00:53:49.659 --> 00:53:50.994
CHANNELS FOR AGENCIES ACROSS THE

00:53:51.061 --> 00:53:52.162
STATE SO THERE ARE SOME VERY

00:53:52.228 --> 00:53:53.330
WELL FUNDED COUNTIES THERE

00:53:53.396 --> 00:53:54.931
CELESTE FUNDING COUNTIES THE

00:53:54.998 --> 00:53:55.999
FUNDING CALCULATOR BRINGS

00:53:56.066 --> 00:53:57.834
EVERYBODY TO THE MIDDLE TO

00:53:57.901 --> 00:53:59.669
JACQUI SECOND POINT IS THAT THE

00:53:59.736 --> 00:54:00.937
RIGHT AMOUNT OF MONEY SUPPOSING

00:54:01.004 --> 00:54:02.405
EVERYBODY WAS AT THE MIDDLE IS

00:54:02.472 --> 00:54:03.573
THAT THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF MONEY

00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:04.608
TO ADEQUATELY FUND THE SOUTHEAST

00:54:04.674 --> 00:54:06.042
ASIA NOT. THAT'S I THINK WHERE

00:54:06.109 --> 00:54:08.078
FURTHER ANALYSIS NEEDS TO COME

00:54:08.144 --> 00:54:10.380
INTO PLAY AND WE HAVE A WAY TO

00:54:10.447 --> 00:54:13.383
STARTED TO RAMP UP FOUR EIGHT

00:54:13.450 --> 00:54:14.484
EIGHT A CONTRACT TO DO A LEVEL

00:54:14.551 --> 00:54:17.354
OR EFFORT STUDY- ON THE CHILD

00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:18.755
SUPPORT PROGRAM AT THAT POINT IN

00:54:18.822 --> 00:54:20.290
TIME RIGHT NOW IT REALLY DOESN'T

00:54:20.357 --> 00:54:21.524
MATTER THE LEVEL OF EFFORT IS

00:54:21.591 --> 00:54:23.026
ACCURATE OR NOT BECAUSE WE

00:54:23.093 --> 00:54:24.527
HAVEN'T GOTTEN INTO AN EQUAL

00:54:24.594 --> 00:54:25.562
PLAYING FIELD ACROSS ALL THE

00:54:25.629 --> 00:54:27.430
LOCAL CHANNELS FOR AGENCIES. SO

00:54:27.497 --> 00:54:28.398
THAT'S OUR FIRST GOAL WITH THIS

00:54:28.465 --> 00:54:30.367
IS TO BRING ACROSS THE STATE AND

00:54:30.433 --> 00:54:31.801
THEN WE WILL ASSESS AND ANALYZE

00:54:31.868 --> 00:54:33.670
WHETHER WE NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDS

00:54:33.737 --> 00:54:34.838
TO ADEQUATELY SUPPORT THE

00:54:34.904 --> 00:54:35.772
ACTIVITIES THE CHILD SUPPORT

00:54:35.839 --> 00:54:37.607
PROGRAM OR IF THERE'S LESS FUNDS

00:54:37.674 --> 00:54:39.075
AND ALSO TO TAKE CARE OF THOSE

00:54:39.142 --> 00:54:40.477
COUNTRIES THAT ARE OVER THE

00:54:40.543 --> 00:54:41.444
FUNDING TACULAR BRINGING THEM

00:54:41.511 --> 00:54:42.779
INTO LINE WITH THE FUNDING CHECK

00:54:42.846 --> 00:54:44.447
LATER AS STANCE TODAY. SO

00:54:44.514 --> 00:54:45.448
THERE'S CERTAINLY NOTHING IN THE

00:54:45.515 --> 00:54:47.617
CONVERSATION BUT IT IS THE NEXT

00:54:47.684 --> 00:54:49.185
STEP THAT WE NEED TO BRING SOME

00:54:49.252 --> 00:54:54.958
PERISHABLE. TRANSPORTATION JUST

00:54:55.025 --> 00:54:55.558
CROSS THE STATE. OKAY BUT WE

00:54:55.625 --> 00:54:56.259
WILL NOT NOT ALL THINGS ARE

00:54:56.326 --> 00:54:58.795
EQUAL SO TO AND CHECK HIS POINT

00:54:58.862 --> 00:55:00.230
ABOUT- THERE ARE SOME THAT. YOU

00:55:00.296 --> 00:55:01.231
KNOW HAVE. OF FUNDING AND THEN

00:55:01.297 --> 00:55:02.832
OTHERS WITHOUT ENOUGH. DOES IT

00:55:02.899 --> 00:55:04.601
MAKE SENSE TO BE GIVING THOSE

00:55:04.668 --> 00:55:05.669
WITH PLENTY OF FUNDING MORE

00:55:05.735 --> 00:55:07.537
FUNDING. THIS FUNDING THAT ALSO

00:55:07.604 --> 00:55:09.406
THIS EDITION OF. MONEY THAT

WE'RE PROVIDING IS ONLY GOING TO

00:55:10.607 --> 00:55:12.008
BE UNDERFUNDED COUNTIES NOT

PLEASE COUNTIES THAT ARE OVER

00:55:13.009 --> 00:55:14.377
FUNDED SO YOU JUST BRING THE

00:55:14.444 --> 00:55:17.580
BOTTOM UP TO ALIGN IT WITH THE

00:55:17.647 --> 00:55:18.348
FUNDING CALCULATOR. AND WHEN WE

00:55:18.415 --> 00:55:20.350
HAD- A YEAR AND A HALF AGO WITH

00:55:20.417 --> 00:55:21.685
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE- OF THE

00:55:21.751 --> 00:55:22.986
PANDEMIC WE HAD TO REMOVE

00:55:23.053 --> 00:55:24.487
FUNDING FROM THE CHILD SUPPORT

00:55:24.554 --> 00:55:25.588
PROGRAM. WE TOOK A LARGER

00:55:25.655 --> 00:55:27.223
PORTION OF THAT FUNDING FROM THE

00:55:27.290 --> 00:55:28.291
LARGER FROM THE MORE WEALTH THAN

00:55:28.358 --> 00:55:29.459
THE CUNTIES THAT A LOWER

00:55:29.526 --> 00:55:30.794
FUNDING. AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO

00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:32.262
BRING THE BOTTOM UP SO WE ARE

00:55:32.328 --> 00:55:33.530
NOT PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING

00:55:33.596 --> 00:55:35.098
TO ANY. COUNTY THAT IS OVER THE

00:55:35.165 --> 00:55:36.700
FUNDING METHODOLOGY OKAY AND

00:55:36.766 --> 00:55:38.334
THEN GOING FORWARD THEY'LL-

00:55:38.401 --> 00:55:39.803
WE'RE GONNA TAKE INTO ACCOUNT

00:55:39.869 --> 00:55:41.771
HOW DO WE KEEP THOSE OVER FRIEND

00:55:41.838 --> 00:55:42.539
THOSE COUNTIES THAT DO VERY

00:55:42.605 --> 00:55:45.275
WELL- I KEEP OUR EYE ON THAT AND

00:55:45.341 --> 00:55:46.943
JUST TO MAKE SURE THE BOTTOM.

00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:48.211
THE BOTTOM KEEPS UP WITH THE

00:55:48.278 --> 00:55:49.646
TOP. THAT IS CORRECT AS WE BRING

00:55:49.713 --> 00:55:51.147
THE PRODUCT TO HAVE PARITY WE

00:55:51.214 --> 00:55:53.016
ARE EXPECTING THOSE. COUNTIES

00:55:53.083 --> 00:55:54.818
WITH THE HIGHER FUNDING TO COME

00:55:54.884 --> 00:55:55.719
INTO LINE WITH THE FUNDING

00:55:55.785 --> 00:55:57.287
FORMULA. THAT'S ACTUALLY

00:55:57.353 --> 00:55:58.388
HAPPENING WITH THE DECLINING

00:55:58.455 --> 00:56:00.090
CASELOAD AND INCREASING COSTS

00:56:00.156 --> 00:56:01.424

TOWARDS THAT THAT'S. WHEN WE

00:56:09.733 --> 00:56:10.400

DISPARITY BETWEEN COUNTIES THAT

00:56:32.889 --> 00:56:35.325
CAME OUT OF A FORMULA OR AN

00:56:35.391 --> 00:56:37.727
EQUATION. THAT WAS ACTUALLY IN

FUNDING BETWEEN COUNTIES. THAT

00:58:13.957 --> 00:58:15.825
WAS AS A RESULT OF A

00:58:15.892 --> 00:58:17.293
NEGOTIATION. BETWEEN THE STATE

PROBLEM THAT GONE ON FOR DECADES

00:58:24.968 --> 00:58:26.970
CLEARLY DECADES OR A

00:58:27.036 --> 00:58:30.707
ESSENTIALLY- WHERE WE'VE IT IS

00:58:30.773 --> 00:58:32.375
FRANKLY HAD A VERY DYSFUNCTIONAL

00:58:32.442 --> 00:58:33.743
WAY OF DISTURBING THE FUNDS

00:58:33.810 --> 00:58:35.712
BETWEEN COUNTY FOR SOME GOT WAIT

00:58:35.778 --> 00:58:36.679

00:58:41.451 --> 00:58:42.485
ABLE TO ADMINISTER CHILD SUPPORT

00:58:46.456 --> 00:58:47.690
WOULD JUST SAY IS THAT- I

APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR PUTTING

00:58:49.158 --> 00:58:50.660
IN THE MONEY NOW WE HAD A LITTLE

00:58:50.727 --> 00:58:52.295
PIES WHEN THE COVETED WE WERE

00:58:52.362 --> 00:58:53.096
AFRAID WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

00:58:53.162 --> 00:58:54.731
ANOTHER BUDGET DOWN FALL. BUT

00:58:54.797 --> 00:58:56.065
THAT WE ACTUALLY GET TO THE

00:58:56.132 --> 00:58:58.067
POINT WHERE WE AGREED TO. AND

00:58:58.134 --> 00:58:59.769
THEN OF COURSE MOVING FORTY ONE

00:58:59.836 --> 00:59:01.804
ENSURE WE CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN

00:59:01.871 --> 00:59:03.273
BALANCE AND APPROPRIATE LEVELS

00:59:03.339 --> 00:59:05.241
OF FUNDING FOR THE COUNTIES. SO

00:59:05.308 --> 00:59:07.944
I DO APPRECIATE WHAT'S HERE IN

00:59:08.011 --> 00:59:09.579
THE LTSA FUNDING METHODOLOGY.

00:59:09.646 --> 00:59:11.247
THE FULL PASS THROUGH I THINK

00:59:11.314 --> 00:59:17.620
AGAIN IS. APPRECIATED- ENTER

00:59:17.687 --> 00:59:18.221
WE'RE HOPING THAT WITH THE FOR

00:59:18.288 --> 00:59:20.056
PASSED PEOPLE TO BE MORE WILLING

00:59:20.123 --> 00:59:21.257
THE PPO TO GET. THAT WE'RE GONNA

00:59:21.324 --> 00:59:22.792
BE A COLLECT MORE MONEY BE. THE

00:59:22.859 --> 00:59:24.394
PEOPLE FAILURE TO CHILD SUPPORT

00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:25.495
WILL KNOW THAT THE MONEY IS

00:59:25.561 --> 00:59:26.996
ACTUALLY GOING TO THEIR CHILD

00:59:27.063 --> 00:59:28.932
AND NOT JUST TO ADMINISTRATION.

00:59:28.998 --> 00:59:30.466
I GUESS THE QUESTION I HAVE AND

00:59:30.533 --> 00:59:32.101
I THINK IF WE TOUCH A LITTLE BIT

00:59:32.168 --> 00:59:34.804
ON IT IS THAT. AND ACTUALLY I DO

00:59:34.871 --> 00:59:36.739
I MAKE A COMMENT THAT. I'M

00:59:36.806 --> 00:59:38.141
ACTUALLY KIND OF HARD TO HEAR

00:59:38.207 --> 00:59:39.909
THAT THE PEOPLE ARE POST CAL

00:59:39.976 --> 00:59:42.045
WORKS ARE DOING BETTER BECAUSE

00:59:42.111 --> 00:59:43.246
THAT MEANS AT LEAST BECAUSE WE

00:59:43.313 --> 00:59:45.214
GET LIKE YOUR IN CAR WORKS WE DO

00:59:45.281 --> 00:59:46.616
ALL THAT WE DO JOB TRAINING WE

00:59:46.683 --> 00:59:47.383
DO A LOT OF OTHER THINGS

00:59:47.450 --> 00:59:48.451
EDUCATION ETCETERA. SO I'M GLAD

00:59:48.518 --> 00:59:49.352
TO KNOW THOSE FAMILIES ARE

00:59:49.419 --> 00:59:51.487
ACTUALLY. DOING SLIDERS ARE

00:59:51.554 --> 00:59:52.488
BETTER OFF THAN THE ONES ARE

00:59:52.555 --> 00:59:53.723
CURRENTLY AND THAT MEANS. AT

00:59:53.790 --> 00:59:54.924
LEAST THAT INTERVENTION DURING

00:59:54.991 --> 00:59:56.259
THE TIME THEY WEREN'T CAL WORKS

00:59:56.326 --> 00:59:57.427
OR HELPING THEM OUT. IN AB

00:59:57.493 --> 00:59:58.328
PUTTING THEM ON A BETTER FOOTING

00:59:58.394 --> 01:00:02.932
I HOPE- BUT I GUESS THE QUESTION

01:00:02.999 --> 01:00:05.234
IS THAT- FOR THE FAMILIES THAT

01:00:05.301 --> 01:00:07.337
ARE CURRENTLY ON CAL WORKS WHAT

01:00:07.403 --> 01:00:09.539
IS DO DO WE HAVE THE ESTIMATE

01:00:09.605 --> 01:00:10.940
FOR WHAT THE COST WOULD BE IF WE

01:00:11.007 --> 01:00:12.141
DID A PASS THROUGH FOR THOSE

01:00:12.208 --> 01:00:13.509
FAMILIES AS IT. IS A COST

01:00:13.576 --> 01:00:15.011
PROHIBITIVE I UNDERSTAND OR SOME

01:00:15.078 --> 01:00:16.980
CHALLENGES YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S

01:00:17.046 --> 01:00:18.915
IT OTHER THINGS TO DO THAT BUT-

01:00:18.982 --> 01:00:20.550
A IS THAT IT IS THERE A COST

01:00:20.616 --> 01:00:21.884
ISSUE THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT

01:00:21.951 --> 01:00:26.422
OR IS IT MORE. OF A YOU KNOW

01:00:39.402 --> 01:00:40.436
HAVE TO MAKE THEIR OWN

ABOUT RECENT CASE LAW DYNAMICS

01:24:44.112 --> 01:24:45.480
POST PANDEMIC I KNOW THIS IS

01:24:45.547 --> 01:24:47.115
BEEN A BIG FOCUS OF THE

FOCUS FOCUS OF OUR OFFICE. JUST

01:24:50.618 --> 01:24:54.222

UNEMPLOYMENT INCREASED CASE LOAD

01:24:58.993 --> 01:25:00.795
WOULD INCREASE IN SOME

01:25:00.862 --> 01:25:02.931
PROPORTION TO THAT THAT THAT'S

01:25:02.997 --> 01:25:04.466
HISTORICALLY WHAT WE'VE SEEN.

01:25:04.532 --> 01:25:06.835
AND INSTEAD OF GETTING AN

01:25:06.901 --> 01:25:08.970
INCREASE WE'D GUIDE HISTORIC

01:25:09.037 --> 01:25:14.442
DECREASE- FROM THE SUMMER OF TWO

01:25:14.509 --> 01:25:15.910

SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE

01:25:20.915 --> 01:25:22.183
AND WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME

01:25:22.250 --> 01:25:25.186
INVESTIGATING. WELL WHAT IS THE

01:25:25.253 --> 01:25:27.555
CAUSE OF THIS DECREASE IN PART

01:25:27.622 --> 01:25:29.457
BECAUSE WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT

01:25:29.524 --> 01:25:30.925
WHETHER POLICY MEASURES WE COULD

01:25:30.992 --> 01:25:32.961
TAKE TO ENSURE THAT ELIGIBLE

01:25:33.027 --> 01:25:35.763
FAMILIES WHO ARE NOT. REACHING

01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:37.866
THE PROGRAM COULD BE REACHED IN

01:25:37.932 --> 01:25:40.969
PART BECAUSE IT'S A- FORECASTING

01:25:41.035 --> 01:25:43.204
A DILEMMA RIGHT- WE HAD THIS

01:25:43.271 --> 01:25:45.940
QUESTION OF AT WHAT POINT WITH

01:25:46.007 --> 01:25:47.108
THE DATA TO CATCH UP WITH

01:25:47.175 --> 01:25:49.210
HISTORIC NORMS IN THE CASE OF

01:25:49.277 --> 01:25:51.312
START GROWING AGAIN. WE KNOW THE

01:25:51.379 --> 01:25:53.414
ADMINISTRATION ALSO CONDUCTED

01:25:53.481 --> 01:25:54.782
THEIR OWN INVESTIGATION OF THOSE

01:25:54.849 --> 01:25:57.385
QUESTIONS INDEPENDENTLY WE BOTH

01:25:57.452 --> 01:26:02.257
I. THINK THROUGH A PROCESS OF

01:26:02.323 --> 01:26:03.591
ELIMINATION. I CAME UP WITH A

01:26:03.658 --> 01:26:04.659
BEST GUESS B. AND THEN THIS WILL

01:26:04.726 --> 01:26:07.295
SOMEHOW TO THE EXTRA- FINANCE.

01:26:07.362 --> 01:26:09.130

UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS AND THIS

01:26:23.378 --> 01:26:24.379

01:26:24.445 --> 01:26:28.016
WEEK- ARE I BENEFIT AND THE

01:26:28.082 --> 01:26:30.385
STAFF WAS MEANT OF THE CANON.

PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE

01:26:33.087 --> 01:26:35.356
WHICH ALLOWED FOR THE FIRST TIME

01:26:35.423 --> 01:26:37.592
SELF EMPLOYED WORKERS TO RECEIVE

01:26:37.659 --> 01:26:39.394
YOU AYE BENEFITS THOSE WITH

01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:42.664
EXPIRED IN SEPTEMBER. IN BOTH

OUR OFFICE IN THE

01:26:43.131 --> 01:26:45.233
ADMINISTRATION. ARE PROJECTING

01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:47.201
THAT WITH THAT EXPIRATION WE

01:26:47.268 --> 01:26:49.203
WOULD SEE SOME RETURN TO THIS

01:26:49.270 --> 01:26:52.574
HISTORICAL NORMS A- RESUMPTION

01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:54.409
OF GROWTH IN THE PROGRAM. AS A

01:26:54.475 --> 01:26:56.277
RESULT DESPITE THE FACT THAT

01:26:56.344 --> 01:26:57.946
RECENTLY OUR TWO OFFICES HAVE

01:26:58.012 --> 01:27:01.482
HAD WILDLY DIVERGING PROJECTIONS

01:27:01.549 --> 01:27:03.284
FOR THIS CASE THOUGH. I

01:27:03.351 --> 01:27:04.252
CURRENTLY WE'RE RIGHT ON THE

01:27:04.319 --> 01:27:06.588
SAME PAGE OF COURSE THE BIG

01:27:06.654 --> 01:27:08.923
QUESTION IS WELL. ARE WE BOTH

01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:11.693
RIGHT- THE INITIAL DATA. IT'S

01:27:11.759 --> 01:27:13.528
NOT REALLY CLEAR IT IS TRUE THAT

01:27:13.595 --> 01:27:15.029
IN THE MOST RECENT DATA IN

01:27:15.096 --> 01:27:17.265
SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER OF LAST

01:27:17.332 --> 01:27:19.834
YEAR- CASELOAD STARTED GROWING

01:27:19.901 --> 01:27:20.969
AGAIN AND THAT'S THE FIRST TIME

01:27:21.035 --> 01:27:23.137
WE'VE SEEN IT BROWN. AGAIN SINCE

01:27:23.204 --> 01:27:25.607
THE FIRST MONTHS OF THE PANDEMIC

01:27:25.673 --> 01:27:27.342
BUT THE GROWTH WAS RELATIVELY

01:27:27.408 --> 01:27:28.810
MODEST ABOUT TWO THOUSAND CASES

01:27:28.876 --> 01:27:30.411
A YEAR BOTH OUR OFFICES WERE

01:27:30.478 --> 01:27:32.480
EXPECTING SOMETHING CLOSER TO

01:27:32.547 --> 01:27:34.048
TEN THOUSAND CASE IT TEN

01:27:34.115 --> 01:27:36.217
THOUSAND CASES A MONTH. HI WE'RE

01:27:36.284 --> 01:27:37.318
STILL WAITING ON MORE RECENT

01:27:37.385 --> 01:27:39.954
DATA SO THIS UNTESTED AS

01:27:40.021 --> 01:27:42.457
ASSUMPTION REMAINS TO BE PROVEN

01:27:42.523 --> 01:27:44.459
BUT- INITIAL DATA SOMEONE

01:27:44.525 --> 01:27:46.361
ENCOURAGING BUT THAT'S THE ONLY

01:27:46.427 --> 01:27:51.466
POINT I NEED TO MAKE RIGHT NOW.

01:27:51.532 --> 01:27:52.166
BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

01:27:52.233 --> 01:27:53.868

BASIC RESOURCES AND SO IT IT IT

01:28:03.945 --> 01:28:06.581

INCREASE THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS

01:28:23.531 --> 01:28:25.867
PROJECTING. YES OUR OFFICE.

01:28:25.933 --> 01:28:28.036
INDEPENDENTLY PROJECTED A VERY

01:28:28.102 --> 01:28:30.538
SIMILAR CASELOAD INCREASE SO. WE

01:28:30.605 --> 01:28:32.974
HAVE NO PROBLEMS WITH THE-ADMINISTRATION'S PROJECTIONS AT

01:28:33.041 --> 01:28:35.176
THIS TIME OF COURSE. FOR ALL

01:28:39.447 --> 01:28:43.317
FFESTINIOG PRINT. THANK YOU IF

01:28:43.384 --> 01:28:46.187
YOU QUESTIONS SO ONE IS THAT-

01:28:46.254 --> 01:28:47.221
YOU KNOW YOU TALK ABOUT OF

01:28:47.288 --> 01:28:49.691
COURSE UNEMPLOYMENT- TO THESE

01:28:49.757 --> 01:28:52.460
ENDING IN SEPTEMBER ALSO- THE

01:28:52.527 --> 01:28:54.696
CHILD TAX CREDIT ENDED- JUST

01:28:54.762 --> 01:28:57.465
ENDED SO TO WHAT DEGREE DO YOU

01:28:57.532 --> 01:28:59.067
THINK IT IS THAT SORT FACT I'M

01:28:59.133 --> 01:29:00.735
SURE YOU FACTORED IN BUT- HOW

01:29:00.802 --> 01:29:01.869
MUCH OF IMPACT YOU THINK THAT'S

01:29:01.936 --> 01:29:04.739
GOING TO HAVE ON CAL WORKS AND

01:29:04.806 --> 01:29:06.474
ROMAN WHICH- WHICH OFTEN.

01:29:06.541 --> 01:29:09.544
INVOLVES FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN

01:29:09.610 --> 01:29:10.678
. EIGHT IN THEORY I COULD HAVE

01:29:10.745 --> 01:29:13.648
TREMENDOUS IMPACT I'D BE IN

01:29:13.715 --> 01:29:15.750
INTERIOR NEARLY EVERY CAL WORKS

01:29:15.817 --> 01:29:19.487
FAMILY IF NOT EVERY- EXCEPTING

01:29:19.554 --> 01:29:21.489
MAYBE THOSE THAT ARE AFFECTED BY

01:29:21.556 --> 01:29:24.358
IT SOME IMMIGRATION- EXCLUSIONS

01:29:24.425 --> 01:29:25.626
SHOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE

01:29:25.693 --> 01:29:28.262
EXPANDED- CHILD TAX CREDIT THAT

01:29:28.329 --> 01:29:31.599
WE SAW. THROUGHOUT THE TWENTY

01:29:31.666 --> 01:29:35.169
TWENTY ONE YEAR- THAT WAS THREE

01:29:35.236 --> 01:29:36.137
HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH THAT

01:29:36.204 --> 01:29:38.706
COMPARES VERY FAVORABLY AT THE

01:29:38.773 --> 01:29:40.508
PER CHILD TO ATTACK COMPARES

01:29:40.575 --> 01:29:42.710
VERY FAVORABLY TO THE ASSISTANCE

01:29:42.777 --> 01:29:44.011
THAT'S OFFERED BY CAL WORKS

01:29:44.078 --> 01:29:46.581
ITSELF SO. POTENTIALLY A VERY

01:29:46.647 --> 01:29:49.317
ATTRACTIVE ALTERNATIVE TO BEING

01:29:49.383 --> 01:29:51.819
ENROLLED IN THE PROGRAM- IT

01:29:51.886 --> 01:29:54.722
CERTAINLY A GOOD HYPOTHESIS THAT

01:29:54.789 --> 01:29:56.390
WITH THAT EXPIRATION IN DECEMBER

01:29:56.457 --> 01:29:58.126
WE WOULD SEE SOME ADDITIONAL

01:29:58.192 --> 01:29:59.994
IMPACT ON CASELOAD. I THINK THE

01:30:00.061 --> 01:30:02.630
COMPLICATING FACTOR THERE MIGHT

01:30:02.697 --> 01:30:05.967
BE- THE ONE PAPER MANY OF THESE

01:30:06.033 --> 01:30:07.835
FAMILIES WERE ELIGIBLE DID IN

01:30:07.902 --> 01:30:10.138
FACT RECEIVE IT AND ALL A LOT OF

01:30:10.204 --> 01:30:12.807
TIMES THAT DEPENDS ON WELL DID

01:30:12.874 --> 01:30:14.776
THEY FILE TAXES IN THE PRIOR

01:30:14.842 --> 01:30:17.245
YEAR A LOT OF CAL WORKS FAMILIES

01:30:17.311 --> 01:30:19.313
REPORTED ZERO EARNED INCOME. AND

01:30:19.380 --> 01:30:20.848
A LOT OF THOSE FAMILIES DON'T

01:30:20.915 --> 01:30:22.850
FILE TAX RETURNS AND THUS WHEN

01:30:22.917 --> 01:30:24.485
AND IF IT FOR ME BUT I GUESS THE

01:30:24.552 --> 01:30:25.419
QUESTION IS THE AMOUNT OF

01:30:25.486 --> 01:30:27.288
PAPERWORK TO FILE TAXES HOW'S

01:30:27.355 --> 01:30:28.823
THAT WAY AGAINST ABOUT PEOPLE

01:30:28.890 --> 01:30:29.824
WORK IT TAKES ABOUT THE CALYX

01:30:29.891 --> 01:30:32.393
RIGHT. HOW MUCH EFFORT IT TAKES

01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:33.528
ALL RIGHT IT'S A GOOD QUESTION

01:30:33.594 --> 01:30:35.730
YEAH. THE OTHER THE OTHER-

01:30:35.797 --> 01:30:39.133
ACTUALLY QUESTION I ASK IS THAT-

01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:40.201
AND AGAIN APPRECIATE THE

01:30:40.268 --> 01:30:41.469
PRESENTATION FROM THE

01:30:41.536 --> 01:30:44.772
ADMINISTRATION'S RECORD THAT SO-

01:30:44.839 --> 01:30:46.507
WE DID. SO MANY ISSUES THAT CAME

01:30:46.574 --> 01:30:47.708
BACK AS THEY CAME UP SEVERAL

01:30:47.775 --> 01:30:49.544
YEARS AGO WAS- AFTER WE GET

01:30:49.610 --> 01:30:54.348
THROUGH THE GREAT RECESSION WAS. THE SINGLE ALLOCATION FORMULA

01:30:54.415 --> 01:30:56.584
ISSUE. THAT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS

01:30:56.651 --> 01:30:57.218
. COUNTIES IN WITH DURING GOOD

01:30:57.285 --> 01:30:58.186
TIMES WOULD BE TREMENDOUSLY

01:30:58.252 --> 01:31:00.955
UNDERFUNDED FOR THEIR STAFF AND

01:31:01.022 --> 01:31:03.291
THEN WHEN THE RECESSION HIT

01:31:03.357 --> 01:31:05.193
SUDDENLY HAVE TO YOU KNOW UP. UP

01:31:05.259 --> 01:31:07.228
FUND AND THEN DON'T HIRE PEOPLE

01:31:07.295 --> 01:31:09.697
AT CETERA. I KNOW IN THIS CASE

01:31:09.764 --> 01:31:11.666
HERE BASED ON THAT TESTIMONY

01:31:11.732 --> 01:31:13.367
FROM THE ADMINISTRATION YELLED

01:31:13.434 --> 01:31:16.938
THAT. REDUCTION OF FIFTY FIVE

01:31:17.004 --> 01:31:18.806
MILLION IS DUE TO I GUESS. THE

01:31:18.873 --> 01:31:20.441
INTENSIFICATION THE DIDN'T WAY

01:31:20.508 --> 01:31:22.777
OUT FORTUNATELY ACTUALLY- THAT

01:31:22.844 --> 01:31:24.345
WE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE A LOT

01:31:24.412 --> 01:31:26.147
MORE PEOPLE AND ROLLED- WHEN

01:31:26.214 --> 01:31:30.251
KOBE HEAD- BUT I GUESS MY

01:31:30.318 --> 01:31:32.920
QUESTION IS THAT. THE OF THE

01:31:32.987 --> 01:31:35.189
REFORMS THAT WE MAY TWO. I USED

01:31:35.256 --> 01:31:36.657
TO COUNTY ADMINISTRATION AND IN

01:31:36.724 --> 01:31:38.726
TERMS OF WHAT WE FIND FOR YOU

01:31:38.793 --> 01:31:40.261
KNOW SINGLE ALLOCATION AND BE

01:31:40.328 --> 01:31:41.963
SURE TO BE ADEQUATE FUND THE

01:31:42.029 --> 01:31:44.065
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR- THE COUNTY

01:31:44.131 --> 01:31:45.600
ELIGIBILITY WORKERS AND OTHER

01:31:45.666 --> 01:31:47.602
WORKERS WO ADMINISTER CAL WORKS

01:31:47.668 --> 01:31:49.871
IS THAT WORKING APPROPRIATELY

01:31:49.937 --> 01:31:51.572
ARE WE HAVING LARGE AND THAT

01:31:51.639 --> 01:31:53.641
THIS IS AN 8% REDUCTION FROM I

01:31:53.708 --> 01:31:55.142
UNDERSTAND FROM THIS BUDGET. IT

01:31:55.209 --> 01:31:56.544
ARE WE HAVING ENOUGH STABILITY

01:31:56.611 --> 01:31:57.612
IN THE LEVEL FUNDING WE'RE

01:31:57.678 --> 01:31:59.614
PROVIDING TO COUNTIES TO

01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:01.649
MAINTAIN THEIR- THE

01:32:01.716 --> 01:32:03.751
INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY SO THAT

01:32:03.818 --> 01:32:05.286
WE CAN CONSISTENTLY ADMINISTERS

01:32:05.353 --> 01:32:06.687
PROGRAMS PARTICULARLY ELDERLY

01:32:06.754 --> 01:32:08.289
UPSWINGS IN THE ECONOMY THINGS

01:32:08.356 --> 01:32:09.490
GET BETTER AND THEN THERE'S LESS

01:32:09.557 --> 01:32:12.593
FUNDING YEAH SO I JUST WANTED TO

01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:14.228
TOUCH ON THAT- SINCE WE DID MAKE

01:32:14.295 --> 01:32:17.899
THOSE REFORMS MANY YEARS AGO NOW

01:32:17.965 --> 01:32:19.000
WE'RE GOING TO THE CYCLE WITH

01:32:19.066 --> 01:32:20.401
COKE. I GUESS THAT'S THE

01:32:20.468 --> 01:32:21.802
QUESTION PERHAPS FOR BOTH

01:32:21.869 --> 01:32:23.237
ADMINISTRATION L. A. L. THEY

01:32:23.304 --> 01:32:28.242
WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT. THANK

I THINK YOU'RE RECORDS AND JUST

01:32:42.490 --> 01:32:43.691
A KIND OF ANSWERING THE BIT

01:32:43.758 --> 01:32:47.728
ACROSS IS. IT IS NOT NECESSARILY

01:32:47.795 --> 01:32:49.897
FOLDER. IN THE FUNDING THAT-

01:32:49.964 --> 01:32:52.099
THAT METHODOLOGY YOU MAY WAS A

IN THE TWENTY ONE BY ACT. THERE

01:32:57.338 --> 01:32:58.673
WERE- TO DIFFERENT ON. TO THIS

01:32:58.739 --> 01:33:00.908
YOUNG CATION FUNDING ONE WAY

01:33:00.975 --> 01:33:03.744
THAT- A ONE TIME AUGMENTATION.

01:33:03.811 --> 01:33:05.613
OF AROUND TWENTY SEVEN MILLION

01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:06.781
AND THEN THERE IS A SECOND

01:33:06.847 --> 01:33:08.416
AUGMENTATION IT WAS AN ONGOING

01:33:08.482 --> 01:33:11.185
AUGMENTATIONS THE BASE. SO WHAT

01:33:11.252 --> 01:33:13.854
YOU'RE REALLY SEEING HERE IS-

01:33:13.921 --> 01:33:17.525
IS- AND- A COMMITMENT AND AN END

01:33:17.591 --> 01:33:18.159
TO WHAT THE CURRENT METHODOLOGY

01:33:18.225 --> 01:33:20.661
IS. TEN YEARS SEEN A DIFFERENCE

01:33:20.728 --> 01:33:22.196
IN THE BUDGET YEAR PROJECTION

01:33:22.263 --> 01:33:24.098
JUST BECAUSE THERE WAS AN

01:33:24.165 --> 01:33:26.467
ADDITIONAL ONE TIME. INCLUDED IN

01:33:26.534 --> 01:33:29.203

01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:30.204
WEIGHT SHE SERVE HIS BEEN

01:33:30.271 --> 01:33:31.339
TRAINING AND WORKING IN THAT

01:33:31.405 --> 01:33:32.640
THIS THIS METHODOLOGY FOR THE

01:33:32.707 --> 01:33:34.775
ADMIN FUNDING IS. IS APPEARING

01:33:34.842 --> 01:33:37.311
TO BE IN LINE. WITH WHAT I

01:33:37.378 --> 01:33:38.512
COUNTY NEEDS TO BE AND THEN

01:33:38.579 --> 01:33:39.947
AGAIN DIRECTOR JOHNSON IF

01:33:40.014 --> 01:33:44.085
THERE'S ANYTHING. THAT YOU WANT

01:33:44.151 --> 01:33:45.686
TO ADD ON THE- I THINK I THINK

01:33:45.753 --> 01:33:47.188

SENATOR PANDUIT WE THINK YOU'RE

01:33:52.927 --> 01:33:54.662
ASKING THE CRUCIAL CRUCIAL

01:33:54.729 --> 01:33:57.665
QUESTION HERE THAT'S IT THERE'S

01:33:57.732 --> 01:34:00.334
TWO CATEGORIES- ONE IS WHETHER

01:34:00.401 --> 01:34:01.969
THE SPECIFIC ADJUSTMENT THAT.

01:34:02.036 --> 01:34:03.070
WAS MADE IN THE GOVERNOR'S

01:34:03.137 --> 01:34:05.906
BUDGET WAS APPROPRIATE JUST BY

01:34:05.973 --> 01:34:08.009
THE BOOK RIGHT AND WE'RE STILL

01:34:08.075 --> 01:34:09.410
WORKING THROUGH UNDERSTAND

01:34:09.477 --> 01:34:11.212
EXACTLY ALL THE MOVING PIECES

01:34:11.278 --> 01:34:13.347
THERE BUT IT DOES LOOK LIKE.

01:34:13.414 --> 01:34:16.117
DESPITE HOW AUDIT APPEARS THEY

01:34:16.183 --> 01:34:17.485
IT WAS APPROPRIATE UNDER THE

01:34:17.551 --> 01:34:21.222
LETTER OF THE LAW FOR THAT

01:34:21.288 --> 01:34:22.757
DROPPED TO OCCUR. PERCENT DOES

01:34:22.823 --> 01:34:24.158
LEAVE OPEN THE FUN TO QUESTION

01:34:24.225 --> 01:34:27.461
WHICH IS- IS THE FORMULA

01:34:27.528 --> 01:34:29.630
OPERATING AS INTENDED BUT

01:34:29.697 --> 01:34:31.932
CERTAINLY ONE OF THE INTENSE OF

01:34:31.999 --> 01:34:33.467
THE FORMULA AS WE UNDERSTAND IT

01:34:33.534 --> 01:34:36.470
WAS TO ENSURE THAT CHANGES TO.

01:34:36.537 --> 01:34:38.839
THIS FUNDING AMOUNT WERE IN LINE

01:34:38.906 --> 01:34:41.375
BOTH WITH COUNTIES ABILITY TO

01:34:41.442 --> 01:34:42.510

01:34:42.576 --> 01:34:45.379
CAPACITY AND ALSO THE CHANGING

01:34:45.446 --> 01:34:47.648
NEEDS OF THE PROGRAM AND- THAT

01:34:47.715 --> 01:34:49.283
SECOND POINT DOESN'T APPEAR TO

01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:50.451
BE ADDRESS WHENEVER YOU HAVE A

01:34:50.518 --> 01:34:52.319
SITUATION. WHERE FUNDING IS

01:34:52.386 --> 01:34:54.622
DECREASING AT A TIME WHEN NEED

01:34:54.688 --> 01:34:58.692
IS INCREASING- THERE'S ALSO JUST

01:34:58.759 --> 01:34:59.527
YOU KNOW UNDERLYING QUESTIONS

01:34:59.593 --> 01:35:04.498
ABOUT- WHETHER ON GOING FORWARD

01:35:04.565 --> 01:35:07.134
THE UNDERLYING FUNDING AMOUNT IS

01:35:07.201 --> 01:35:10.337
ADEQUATE TO MEET THE NEED WHERE

01:35:10.404 --> 01:35:12.039
WE'RE STILL WE'RE- WAITING ON

01:35:12.106 --> 01:35:15.076
ADDITIONAL DATA FROM- COUNTY IS

01:35:15.142 --> 01:35:16.777
TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THAT

01:35:16.844 --> 01:35:17.878

MINISTRATION POINTING OUT THAT-

01:35:20.347 --> 01:35:21.816
PART OF THE QUOTE REDUCTION IS

01:35:21.882 --> 01:35:23.350
BECAUSE OF AUGMENTATIONS MADE

01:35:23.417 --> 01:35:26.954

OUT USING AN AGE BASED APPROACH

02:00:09.335 --> 02:00:10.603

CHOOSE TO TARGET OTHER

02:00:38.497 --> 02:00:40.700
POPULATIONS CERTAINLY- BASED ON

02:00:40.766 --> 02:00:42.501
OUR INITIAL ESTIMATES WHAT WE

02:00:42.568 --> 02:00:44.637
THINK THAT. THERE ARE OTHER AGE

02:00:44.704 --> 02:00:47.239
POPULATIONS YOUNGER- POPULATIONS

02:00:47.306 --> 02:00:48.975
THAT ARE MORE NUMEROUS IN THE

02:00:49.041 --> 02:00:51.077
STATE AND IT MAY ALSO BE MORE

02:00:51.143 --> 02:00:52.878

COURSE. IN THE MEANTIME- BUT IT

02:01:04.957 --> 02:01:08.060
MINISTRY AND- AUTOMATED MASON

02:01:08.127 --> 02:01:08.928

SAME FOR ALL THE POPULATION SO.

02:01:11.230 --> 02:01:13.299
THAT DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT IN

FIFTY FIVE AN OLDER AND AGAIN

02:01:26.879 --> 02:01:28.648
THAT THAT HAS ALSO BEEN A TARGET

02:01:28.714 --> 02:01:30.483
POPULATION WE'RE LOOKING AT. BUT

02:01:30.549 --> 02:01:32.718

SO- AS YOU MAY KNOW IN GENERAL

02:01:46.866 --> 02:01:48.634
THERE TEND TO BE FEWER SUPPORTS

02:01:48.701 --> 02:01:50.202

MUCH FARTHER DO WE HAVE TO GO I

02:06:54.606 --> 02:06:55.874
KNOW THAT'S IT. I MEAN OVERALL

02:06:55.941 --> 02:06:57.042
FOR CALIFORNIA THE MET DID

02:06:57.109 --> 02:06:58.610
MENTION WE HAVE A RECORD NUMBER

02:06:58.677 --> 02:07:00.279

02:07:00.346 --> 02:07:02.247
ACTUALLY CALIFORNIA IS A STATE

02:07:02.314 --> 02:07:03.882
HISTORICALLY HAS ACTUALLY. BEEN

02:07:03.949 --> 02:07:05.417
LOWER THAN ANY OTHER STATES IN

02:07:05.484 --> 02:07:05.985

REASONS WHY. AND SEEMS LIKE A SO

02:07:16.095 --> 02:07:18.130
MANY OTHER STATES HAVE DONE MUCH

02:07:18.197 --> 02:07:19.932
BETTER. BUT I THINK IT'S

02:07:19.999 --> 02:07:21.000

LOW BARRIERS TO PROVIDE DAY

02:31:32.483 --> 02:31:34.318
CRITICAL HOUSING SUPPORTS TWO

PORTFOLIO OF HOUSING TO END

02:41:20.937 --> 02:41:22.305
HOMELESSNESS WHICH CAN BE

02:41:22.372 --> 02:41:24.274
ACHIEVED THROUGH CONTINUED

02:41:28.512 --> 02:41:29.679
INCLUDES A SIGNIFICANT

02:41:29.746 --> 02:41:31.782
INVESTMENT OF FIFTY FIVE MILLION

02:41:31.848 --> 02:41:33.884

URGENT NEED. FOR IT BUT THAT'S

02:45:49.172 --> 02:45:51.041
TO BE CREATED AND PRESERVED SO

ALSO ALSO SEE WE'RE PROVIDING A

02:46:03.687 --> 02:46:05.822
SIGNIFICANT LEVEL OF TECHNICAL

02:46:05.889 --> 02:46:08.024

02:46:10.560 --> 02:46:11.861
DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION

02:46:11.928 --> 02:46:14.431
PROCESS. OF THESE FACILITIES AND

02:46:14.497 --> 02:46:15.765
SETTINGS TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE

02:46:15.832 --> 02:46:18.535
ABLE TO. AGGRESSIVE TIMELINES.

02:46:18.601 --> 02:46:20.670
OKAY AND WHEN YOU SEE THE- THE

02:46:20.737 --> 02:46:22.906
CERTAIN AMOUNT FOR THE OPERATING

02:46:22.972 --> 02:46:25.542
AND THAT THAT IS JUST. HE DID SO

02:46:25.608 --> 02:46:26.509
THAT'S NOT FOR THE PRESERVATION

02:46:26.576 --> 02:46:27.911
AS FOR THE OPERATION OF THE

02:46:27.977 --> 02:46:30.013
FACILITIES SO AS I JUST MCNALL

02:46:30.080 --> 02:46:31.781
ADJOURNMENT THAT OUR CURRENT

02:46:31.848 --> 02:46:32.882
LEVEL OF REIMBURSEMENT FOR A

02:46:32.949 --> 02:46:35.819
BED. IS INADEQUATE FOR THE LEVEL

02:46:35.885 --> 02:46:39.155
OF NEED. OF EACH INDIVIDUAL IN

02:46:39.222 --> 02:46:41.124
THE BED HAS GONE UP. SO THE

02:46:41.191 --> 02:46:43.593
QUESTION IN THE AGENDA RELATING

02:46:43.660 --> 02:46:45.362
TO THE FIFTY FIVE MILLION FOR

02:46:45.428 --> 02:46:47.597
THE OPERATING SUBSIDY PAYMENTS

02:46:47.664 --> 02:46:50.667

MAN. FOR EXISTING- FACILITIES

02:46:54.204 --> 02:46:56.639
SERVING AND SSI RECIPIENTS SO

02:46:56.706 --> 02:46:58.842
WHO KNOWS AND TYPES OF PAYMENTS

02:46:58.908 --> 02:47:00.510
WOULD BE USED TO COVER

02:47:00.577 --> 02:47:02.679
OPERATIONAL DEFICIT SO IT COULD

02:47:02.746 --> 02:47:05.482
BE- THINGS TO DO WITH JUST

02:47:05.548 --> 02:47:08.251
OPERATING A FACILITY NOT RELATED

02:47:08.318 --> 02:47:09.552
TO THE SERVICES. THAT ARE

02:47:09.619 --> 02:47:11.554
PROVIDED TO INDIVIDUALS IN THE

02:47:11.621 --> 02:47:14.724
FACILITIES SO THAT UTILITY BILLS

02:47:14.791 --> 02:47:18.294
FOR- ADMINISTRATION AND THOSE

02:47:18.361 --> 02:47:23.066
TYPES AND- ACOSTA COVERAGE TO

02:47:23.133 --> 02:47:24.567
THE OPERATING PAYMENT. THE

02:47:24.634 --> 02:47:26.403
INSURANCE ADD AS CERTAINLY WE

02:47:26.469 --> 02:47:28.671
BEEN FOCUSED ON ENSURING THAT WE

02:47:28.738 --> 02:47:31.708

SENIOR CARE SETTINGS ACROSS

02:47:34.110 --> 02:47:35.745
CALIFORNIA WHILE WE SEE WHEN WE

02:47:35.812 --> 02:47:37.981
SEE PROGRAMS CLOSE RIGHT THEY

02:47:38.047 --> 02:47:39.182

LICENSING DIVISION THAT THEY'RE-

02:47:40.750 --> 02:47:42.252

02:47:42.318 --> 02:47:43.887
ACTIVE STATUS ARE CLOSE WE'VE

02:47:43.953 --> 02:47:45.822
BEEN SERVING THOSE PROGRAMS- AND

02:47:45.889 --> 02:47:48.792
SO AT THE COST OF OPERATING WAS

02:47:48.858 --> 02:47:49.759
ONE AND THEN CERTAINLY THAT KIND

02:47:49.826 --> 02:47:51.428
OF LARGEST RESPONSE. ON THOSE

02:47:51.494 --> 02:47:54.030
SURVEYS THAT WE SAW ESPECIALLY

02:47:54.097 --> 02:47:55.632
AS IT RELATES AGAIN TO SETTINGS

02:47:55.698 --> 02:47:57.634
THAT WERE SUPPORTING SSI

02:47:57.700 --> 02:47:59.102
RECIPIENTS SO THAT'S KIND OF HOW

02:47:59.169 --> 02:48:01.738
WE'RE GETTING TO- THIS OPERATING

02:48:01.805 --> 02:48:03.673
SUBSIDIARIES RESERVE COMPONENT

CERTAINLY BE STUDYING. IT'S

02:48:07.010 --> 02:48:08.411
IMPACTS ON THE ABILITY OF

02:48:08.478 --> 02:48:10.713
PROGRAMS TO USE THATREMAIN OPEN

02:48:10.780 --> 02:48:11.881
THEY NEED THEIR COSTS RIGHT

02:48:11.948 --> 02:48:13.283
BECAUSE ONCE THAT SUBSIDY GOES

02:48:13.349 --> 02:48:14.150
AWAY WE'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE

02:48:14.217 --> 02:48:16.219
THAT. THAT GAP THAT WE'RE GONNA

02:48:16.286 --> 02:48:18.721
HAVE TO FILL SOME KIND OF WAY

02:48:18.788 --> 02:48:20.890
FOR. AN END CAN YOU WIND WHEN

02:48:20.957 --> 02:48:24.093
YOU'RE SERVING THE- THE

02:48:24.160 --> 02:48:25.795
FACILITIES THAT ARE THAT ARE

02:48:25.862 --> 02:48:26.429
THINKING ABOUT CLOSING. IS IT

02:48:26.496 --> 02:48:28.498
BECAUSE OF THE COST OF REAL

02:48:28.565 --> 02:48:30.500
ESTATE OR IS IT BECAUSE THE COST

02:48:30.567 --> 02:48:32.001
OF PROVIDING CARE IN THE AND THE

02:48:32.068 --> 02:48:36.940
COMPLICATIONS. OF FUNDING. YEAH

02:48:37.006 --> 02:48:38.675
WE IT'S A BIT HABIT WORK

02:48:38.741 --> 02:48:40.076
REFINING OUR SURVEY TO OVER TIME

02:48:40.143 --> 02:48:41.444
IT'S BEEN A BIT OF THAT A MORE

02:48:41.511 --> 02:48:43.646
OPEN ENDED. QUESTIONS SO IT'S

02:48:43.713 --> 02:48:45.615
BEEN MOSTLY AND MORE GENERICALLY

02:48:45.682 --> 02:48:46.983
RESPONDED TO BUT WE CAN

02:48:47.050 --> 02:48:49.018
CERTAINLY LOOK AT. HOW WE'RE

02:48:49.085 --> 02:48:50.320
ASKING THAT QUESTION IN OUR

02:48:50.386 --> 02:48:52.589
ABILITY TO GET A LITTLE MORE

02:48:52.655 --> 02:48:55.124
SPECIFIC TO YOUR QUESTION- IS

02:48:55.191 --> 02:48:57.227
THAT WE DO EXACTLY WHAT HAS BEEN

02:48:57.293 --> 02:48:59.028
WAS THE DRIVER AROUND ANY COSTS

02:48:59.095 --> 02:49:00.930
AT A CHALLENGES THAT THEY'RE

02:49:00.997 --> 02:49:01.965
FACING SO GLAD TO MAKE SURE

02:49:02.031 --> 02:49:03.399
THAT'S- A PART OF OUR OUR

02:49:03.466 --> 02:49:04.701
QUESTIONS GOING FORWARD. THAT

02:49:04.767 --> 02:49:05.335
WOULD BE GREAT BECAUSE THAT'S

02:49:05.401 --> 02:49:06.536
SOMETHING WE HEAR REPEATEDLY

02:49:06.603 --> 02:49:08.304
THAT THESE THAT THE STEP DOWNS

02:49:08.371 --> 02:49:09.272
ARE OR CLOSING THAT'S HARD TO

02:49:09.339 --> 02:49:12.242
FIND- AND IF WE CAN'T SOLVE THAT

02:49:12.308 --> 02:49:14.511
THEN. THEN THAT'S A HUGE CHUNK

02:49:14.577 --> 02:49:16.513
MISSED OUT OF OUR OUR SYSTEM.

02:49:16.579 --> 02:49:18.114
AND WILL IMPACT EVERYTHING ELSE

02:49:18.181 --> 02:49:19.215
SO I THINK IF WE COULD FIND OUT

02:49:19.282 --> 02:49:20.850
EXACTLY SOME OF THE DIRECT

02:49:20.917 --> 02:49:25.388
REASONS- AND SEE WHAT WE CAN DO

02:49:25.455 --> 02:49:26.189
ABOUT. FOR THOSE HOLES OR- DOING

02:49:26.256 --> 02:49:27.957
SOMETHING ABOUT GAPS. I THINK TO

02:49:28.024 --> 02:49:29.993
KEEP THOSE THOSE. NOT ONLY TO

02:49:30.059 --> 02:49:32.061
GROW THE NUMBER WHO ARE OFFERING

02:49:32.128 --> 02:49:33.329
THE SERVICES BUT TO MAINTAIN THE

02:49:33.396 --> 02:49:35.965
ONES. THAT WE HAVE WHICH- IS

02:49:36.032 --> 02:49:37.800
WOULD BE REALLY VALUABLE DATA

02:49:37.867 --> 02:49:38.935
AND I'D APPRECIATE IT. IF WE

02:49:39.002 --> 02:49:40.937
COULD FOCUS ON THAT. DOCUMENT I

02:49:41.004 --> 02:49:43.273
THANK YOU AND I JUST ALSO WANT

02:49:43.339 --> 02:49:45.441
TO REITERATE WHAT- CARE EGGMAN

02:49:45.508 --> 02:49:46.709
MENTIONED I THINK FOR BOTH OF

02:49:46.776 --> 02:49:48.645
THESE. NOW FOR THIS PROGRAM BOTH

02:49:48.711 --> 02:49:50.280
CAPITAL EXPANSION PROJECTS WHERE

02:49:50.346 --> 02:49:52.115
YOU HAVE A CAPITALIZE OPERATES

02:49:52.181 --> 02:49:54.617
OF THE RESERVE. FOR FIVE YEARS

02:49:54.684 --> 02:49:56.352
AND THEN THE FACT ALLOCATED

02:49:56.419 --> 02:49:57.820
FIFTY FIVE MILLION FOR. YEN

02:49:57.887 --> 02:50:00.823
OPERATING. A SPEAKS TO WE NEED

02:50:00.890 --> 02:50:02.692
TO REVISIT THAT OUR

02:50:02.759 --> 02:50:05.528
REIMBURSEMENT PAYMENTS BECAUSE-

02:50:05.595 --> 02:50:06.496

REALLY DO NEED TO LOOK AT THESE

02:50:22.278 --> 02:50:23.246

THEM CURRENTLY BUT WE ANTICIPATE

02:51:08.458 --> 02:51:10.560
IT TO BE LESS THAN 5% OF THE

02:51:10.627 --> 02:51:13.029

ABOUT OVERLAPPING PROGRAM SO

02:51:35.551 --> 02:51:38.588
FORTH- SO. YOU KNOW PREVIOUSLY

HOMELESSNESS I GUESS THIS IS THE

02:51:46.429 --> 02:51:47.864
AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS ALSO

02:51:47.930 --> 02:51:49.365

BENEFITS. SO SEEMS LIKE SOME

02:51:52.301 --> 02:51:53.836
OVERLAP SO WHAT'S GOING TO BE

02:51:53.903 --> 02:51:55.938
THE INTEGRATION BETWEEN C. C. E.

02:51:56.005 --> 02:51:58.374

WOULD BE NOTE THAT- WELL LISA

02:52:06.683 --> 02:52:07.784

02:55:21.510 --> 02:55:21.944
FACT THAT THERE MAY BE

02:55:22.011 --> 02:55:24.247

HOW THAT MIGHT BE ADDRESSED AND

02:55:32.321 --> 02:55:33.055
WHETHER WE'RE GONNA SEE AN ISSUE

02:55:33.122 --> 02:55:35.491
WITH- PEOPLE SUBSCRIBING TO THIS

02:55:35.558 --> 02:55:40.162
PARTICULAR. PROGRAM PARTICULARLY

02:55:40.229 --> 02:55:41.497
IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. SO ON THE

02:55:41.564 --> 02:55:43.132
CAPITALIST. PROJECT THERE IS A

02:55:43.199 --> 02:55:44.834
REQUIREMENT FOR A USE

02:55:44.901 --> 02:55:47.436

02:56:08.457 --> 02:56:09.458
USE RESTRICTION AFTER ALL WE'RE

02:56:09.525 --> 02:56:11.060
INVESTING MONEY INTO IT BUT DO

02:56:11.127 --> 02:56:12.762
YOU SEE THAT THERE WE MIGHT HAVE

02:56:12.828 --> 02:56:14.030
SOME CHALLENGES A CERTAIN PARTS

02:56:14.096 --> 02:56:14.964
OF THE STATE WHERE SOMEONE MAY

02:56:15.031 --> 02:56:17.767
NOT BE WILLING TO SIGN UP FOR A
