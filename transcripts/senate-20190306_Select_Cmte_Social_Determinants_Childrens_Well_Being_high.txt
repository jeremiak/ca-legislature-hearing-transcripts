FROM THE THIRTY DISTRICT AND IT'S MY PLEASURE. TO GAVEL DOWN AND CONVENE THE FIRST HEARING. OF THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY LEGISLATIVE SESSION OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE. ON THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF CHILDREN'S HEALTH. YES THAT'S A MOUTHFUL. AS YOU HEAR ABOUT WHAT WE INTEND. TO TALK ABOUT -- AND BE EXPOSED. TO UNDERSTAND WHY WE'VE CHOSEN THAT TITLE. I SEE WE HAVE TRANSLATION SERVICES HERE TODAY. SO I'M GOING TO TRY TO BE MINDFUL TO SPEAK SLOWLY. AND IF AT ANY POINT. YOU NEED TO REMIND ME WAVE YOUR HANDS. BECAUSE NATURALLY I MUST BE TALKER. SO AGAIN GOOD AFTERNOON WE IN IN OUR THRILLED TO SEE SUCH A HUGE TURN OUT HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM. SENATOR PAN WE HAVE TO OVERFLOW HEARING ROOMS IN THE BUILDING WHICH YOU KNOW IS NOT EASY TO DO ON A ON A SECTION DAY. AND THEY'VE GOT A JUMBO TRON OUTSIDE ON THE WEST STEP TO PEOPLE OUTSIDE ARE ABLE TO VIEW. SELECTED MY HAT -- TO ALTHOUGH SPOKE RABAL TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN WE THANK YOU. WE WANT TO GIVE A SPECIAL SHOUT OUT TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY POSSE WHO'S HERE TODAY AT THE CAPITOL. I WANT TO WELCOME YOU TO YOUR STATE'S CAPITAL -- WE UNDERSTAND WHAT IT TAKES TO GET TO SACRAMENTO VERTICALLY THIS TIME OF YEAR AND I KNOW YOU TWO BUSES EARLY IN THE DAY AND THE RAIN WAS NOT IN OUR FAVOR. BUT YOU ARE SHOWING YOUR COMMITMENT AND YOU DID YOUR ADVOCACY THAT A LITTLE RAIN DIDN'T RAIN ON YOUR PARADE WE THANK YOU FOR COMING. WE HAVE A FULL SELECT COMMITTEE HEARING. IN TERMS OF MEMBERSHIP THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE ARE -- SENATORS BATES. CABALLEROHER TITLE BACK TO PAN INTO THE RUBIO. THIS IS A HEARING DAY AND SO YOU WILL SEE PEOPLE COME IN AND NOW I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE OFFENDED BY THEM COMING AND GOING IT'S JUST THAT WE HAVE. FIVE THINGS TO DO ALL THE SAME TIME AND SO OF BY VIRTUE OF THE FACT THAT THEY'RE ON COMMITTEE THEY'LL BE TRACKING YOUR TESTIMONY AND KEEPING UP WITH WHAT YOU'RE DOING. THE PLANS FOR THE SELECT COMMITTEE AGAIN THIS IS THE FIRST WHEN WE LOOK FOR QUITE FRANKLY TO TAKING THE SHOW ON THE ROAD WE'RE GOING TO TRAVEL THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN AREAS WITH THE HIGHEST POVERTY RATE. AND SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES SO WE OF LEGISLATIVE CAN LEARN MORE ABOUT THE PROBLEMS COMMUNITIES FACE AND WHAT MIGHT BE DONE TO SUPPORT YOU. SELECT COMMITTEE THEY'RE AN IMPORTANT TOOL WE HAVE THAT ALLOW US TO DISCUSS ISSUES MORE IN DEPTH AS OPPOSED TO JUST WAIT IN AS A AYE OR NAY ON A PIECE OF LEGISLATION. SO WHY THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. AS A LEGISLATOR WHO'S WORKED -- IN THE BUILDING FORMERLY A STAFF BUT NOW THE SENATOR. I THINK THAT WE ALWAYS BRING OUR BACKGROUND EXPERIENCES TO THE TABLE WHEN WE ACT. SO FOR ME IT WAS A NO BRAINER WHEN I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH OUR FIRST WITNESS TO TALK ABOUT WAYS IN WHICH WE COULD DELVE MORE DEEPLY. INTO THE ISSUES THAT LEAD TO CHILDHOOD POVERTY. OUR NEXT HEARING I'M PROUD TO SAY WILL BE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN JULY. AND WILL FOCUS ON HEALTH ACCESS. IN THE FALL WILL DO A THIRD HEARING ON IMMIGRATION IN LOS ANGELES. AND NEXT YEAR WE INTEND TO FOCUS ON ENVIRONMENT EDUCATION POVERTY M. LAND YOU. OF COURSE TODAY'S HEARING WILL FOCUS ON THE ROLE HOUSING PLAY. IN ONE'S ABILITY TO BE HEALTHY. WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO OPEN THE FLOOR AND ASK A DOCTOR PAN TO BRING READING. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER MITCHELL AT YOUR MITCHELL -- I REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR CONVENING THIS SELECT COMMITTEE ON SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF CHURCH CHILDREN'S WELL BEING.

UNLIKE A TRADITIONAL COMMITTEE HEARING WE WILL OPEN IT UP. FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE END OF THE HEARING OF THOSE OF YOU THIS IS YOUR FIRST HEARING. MAKE NO. AT THE END OF THE HEARING ALL CALL FOR PUBLIC YOU'LL SEE THERE'S A MICROPHONE THERE THAT THE SENATE SERGEANTS WILL DIRECT YOU TO AND THAT WILL BE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU. TO COMMENT ON SOMETHING YOU'VE HEARD ALL IN TODAY'S COMMITTEE HEARING TO PROVIDE US WITH YOUR PERSPECTIVE. WE HAVE. FOUR PANELS WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN WITH A GOLDEN STATE FOR ALL. AND MISTER HEWITT OUR FIRST PANELIST MISTER HEWITT IS THE PRESIDENT AND CEO. OF THE FEAR HEALTH FOUNDATION A PHILANTHROPIC GROUP THAT IS WORKING ON PROMOTING HEALTH EQUITY IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. MISTER HEWITT YOUR RECALL THAT WE WERE STANDING IN THE FOYER OF YOUR VERY BUILDING I GUESS A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO. WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT HOW WE COULD PARTNER -- TO ELEVATE THE ISSUE OF NOT ONLY CHILD POVERTY WITH WE BOTH WORKED ON FOR MOST OF OUR PROFESSIONAL CAREERS BUT TO REALLY TALK ABOUT IT FROM THE CONTEXT OF REGION'S RECOGNIZING THAT -- CALIFORNIA IS A VERY DIVERSE STATE AND SO WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE POCKETS IN WHICH CHILDREN ARE EXPERIENCING DISPROPORTIONATE LEVELS OF POVERTY. ARE THAT CONVERSATIONS GROWN THE SELECT COMMITTEE AND I'M PROUD TO PARTNER WITH YOU TODAY AND I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE HERE TO JUMP START IT THANK YOU FOR COMING. AND THE SUN REPAIR MAN I HAD THE GREAT PRIVILEGE OF WORKING WITH TWO OF YOU ARE HERE TODAY LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU IN THE FUTURE. AS WELL. THIS IS THE INCREDIBLE INCREDIBLE DAY FOR US AND IT DID START WITH A CONVERSATION I MEAN. GREAT THINGS CAN HAPPEN SOMETIMES JUST PASSING ONE OTHER IN THE HALLWAY -- WHEN YOU HAVE FOLKS WHO ARE AS COMMITTED TO ISSUES AROUND CHILDREN? AND LEVY A NEW EFFECTS OF POVERTY -- AND TAKE THAT WORK. AS SERIOUSLY AS IT SHOULD BE TAKEN GIVEN THE IMPACTS OF ACTUALLY HAS ON THE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AN IMPLICATION THAT HAS FILE GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IS NOT. SOME INNOCUOUS CONDITION. WE'VE BEEN VERY PROUD OVER THE PAST DECADE TO BE FOCUS ON THE SOCIAL TERMS OF HEALTH. NOW WE KNOW WHEN WE SUPPORT A LOT OF WORK THAT'S FOCUSED ON ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. WE KNOW THAT HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS WHEN ONE IS ILL OR SICK OR YOU'RE TRYING TO PREVENT THOSE THINGS FROM HAPPENING. BUT WE ALSO KNOW 285% YOU HEALTH HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR BILL ACCESS HEALTH CARE. IT'S ABOUT THE PLACES YOU LIVE IN THE OPPORTUNITIES YOU ACTUALLY HAVE. AND WE AS A FOUNDATION OF FOCUS MOST OF OUR ENERGIES. IN THAT REGARD. AND SO I THOUGHT WITH THAT TODAY JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF WHO WE ARE. YOU KNOW PART OF OUR WORK IS ALSO ABOUT BRINGING COMMUNITIES AND THEIR IDEAS AND OUR ASPIRATIONS ABOUT A FUTURE THEY PREFER TO BE AS MUCH AS WE POSSIBLY CAN. AND SO TODAY IS OUR EQUITY ON THE MALL WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE DONE FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS WHERE WE BRING COMMUNITY TO THE CAPITAL. TO ALLOW THEM THIS YEAR WITH YOU THEIR STORIES VERY OUR AND THEIR HOPES FOR THE FUTURE. FOUR YEARS AGO WE STARTED THIS SEVENTY PEOPLE JOINED US. THREE YEARS AGO WE HAD A THOUSAND LAST YEAR IT WAS. FIFTEEN HUNDRED TODAY OVER TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE OUT ON THE WEST WALL THE DISTRICT WHERE A CAPITAL -- WAITING HERE AND SHARING YOUR IDEAS -- WOULD LEGISLATORS ABOUT WHAT THEY BELIEVE NEEDS TO HAPPEN GOING FORWARD AS RELATES TO CHILDREN A GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS RELATES TO COMMUNITIES AND FAMILIES. AS WELL. I CAN'T UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE WORK ENOUGH. NO CALIFORNIA IS AN INCREDIBLE STATE NOW I MOVED HERE AS A YOUNG MAN. MADE AT MY HOME -- AND NO LEFT TO MY OWN DEVICES THIS IS WHERE THEY WILL PUT ME TO REST WHEN THAT TIME COMES AS WELL. I LOVE THE STATE. ASSN CREDIBLE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD WE ALL KNOW THAT. BUT ALSO HAS THE HIGHEST POVERTY RATE IN AMERICA -- AND WE THINK THAT THIS IDEA TO CALIFORNIANS. IS SOMETHING WITH ALTHOUGH WHICH WISDOM INNOVATION AND I THINK ON A MORAL FORTITUDE THAT'S BEEN DISPLAYED BY LEADERS IN THE STATE IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO AWAY WITH. IS A SOCIAL CONSTRUCT THAT NEED NOT HAPPEN. THEY NEED NOT BE REAL. THIS IS THE REALITY THAT WE CONTROL. WHICH ALSO MEANS THE REALITY THAT WE CAN CHANGE. AND SO WE ARE EXCITED NODDED TO BE PARTING WITH ALL OF YOU. TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT. ALL EXPECTATIONS IN OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THIS. SELECT COMMITTEE OF FALLS INTO THREE CATEGORIES. VERY HAPPY WILL BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON SOME SPECIFIC ISSUES AND TODAY WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT HOUSING AND ITS IMPACT ON THE WELL BEING OF CHILDREN. WE THINK THAT THE FUND THAT WILL BE ABLE DEEP UNDERSTANDING ABOUT pWHAT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES ALL. BUT ALSO TO MOVE THAT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT SOME OF THOSE SOLUTIONS COULD POSSIBLY BE. AND THEN LASTLY TO KIND OF BUILD THE KIND OF CONSTITUENCY THAT ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO ARE. WILLING TO WORK HARD TO DEAL WITH TOUGH ISSUES NEEDS IN ORDER TO MOVE AN AGENDA. FOR THIS ABOUT MOVEMENT BUILDING FOR US IS ABOUT EMPOWERING THOSE WHO OFTEN ON EMPOWER. ALLOWING THEMTO HAVE THE SAME HOPES AND ASPIRATIONS AND DREAMS AND ACCESS TO THE MECHANISM THAT MAKE THOSE THINGS REAL. THAT MOST OF US WITH GREAT A PRIVILEGE HAVE THAT'S WHY WE ARE HERE TODAY. I COULD RATTLE OFF A LOT OF STATISTICS THAT ON MY SHEET IN FRONT OF ME. ABOUT THE CONDITIONS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND I COULD TALK A LOT ABOUT THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE HAVE FOCUSED OUR WROTE ONE IN FOUR SCHOOLS YOU CAN'T DRINK THE WATER. NOT TELL YOU A QUICK STORY THAT I ACCOMPLISHED WITH A COLLEAGUE IN FLORIDA. WHEN WE TOLD HER THE STORY SHE WANTS A FOUNDATION? FOR WHEN WE TOLD A STORY SHE ACTUALLY THOUGHT THAT WE WERE BEING UNTRUE. ACTUALLY STILL RELY. A COMMENT TO ME WAS IN THE GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT THE HEART OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND WITH TECHNOLOGY AND YOU KNOW ALL THE WONDERFUL THINGS WE ABOUT CALIFORNIA. THAT THERE COULD BE A REGIONAL PLACE WHERE KIDS COULD NOT DRINK THE WATER SCHOOL. WE'RE EXPOSURE TO PESTICIDES AS HIGH AS IT IS IN THE CENTER OF OUR WE'RE RATES OF ASTHMA WILL GOING ON ADDRESS. THAT WAS NOT THE CALIFORNIA SHE KNEW. SHE LIVES IN FLORIDA. BUT NOT THE KIND OF IDEA THAT SHE HELD IN AHEAD. ABOUT WHAT WOULD LIKE LIFE WOULD BE LIKE. FOR FOLKS WHO ARE NOT WEALTHY. AND I CONSIDER TO BE OVERLY INFLUENCED. BUT WHO WERE RESIDENTS OF THIS GREAT STATE. THAT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE TO BE IN THOSE TWO CONDITIONS. IN ORDER TO GET THE THINGS THAT WE CONSIDER TO BE BASICS IN ONE'S LIFE. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE TO REALLY LOOK AT AS I SAID TO BETTER UNDERSTAND. AND THE CHANGE. WE ALSO ON THE BALLOT HOUSING. OVER TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND KIDS ON A DAILY BASIS ARE HOMELESS AND CAL. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO CHANGE. WE KNOW THAT IS NOT NOTION OF TO CALIFORNIA'S IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN. DOCUMENTED IN ANY NUMBER OF PLACES. NO I'LL GREAT HOPE TODAY IS THAT. WE MOVE BEYOND THE STUDIES AND THE DOCUMENTATION WHICH WE KNOW WAS IMPORTANT -- TO A LEVEL OF ACTION AN ACTIVITY WHICH WE KNOW WAS A SECTION. WE KNOW THAT. FOR THOSE OF US WHO WANT TO DO AWAY WITH THIS IDEA OF TO CALIFORNIA'S. THAT WE FEEL TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES. OF CHILD POVERTY THIS NOTION. OF OF GOLDEN STATE. FOR CAN NEVER BE CHEAP. THAT WILL BECOME NOT THE GREAT REALITY. IN CALIFORNIA. BUT THE GREAT MYTH [inaudible] ABOUT CALIFORNIA. IN THE SAME WAY MY COLLEAGUE IN FLORIDA COULD NOT BELIEVE THERE WERE SCHOOLS. WHERE KIDS CAN BATTERY? FOR SO MY RATE ASK OF YOU TODAY. IS THAT WE CONTINUE TO PARTNER IN WAYS THAT REALLY IS ABOUT MOVING AGENDA. FOR AND I KNOW. THIS IS NOT. NO SPEAKING TO REQUIRE ALTHOUGH MY MOM ALWAYS TOLD ME THAT CHECK THE WHY GO TO CHURCH FOR REASON TO TO JUST THINK THIS THING SO. IT'S JUST A TO SING. WHAT THE ALLOW US? AND IN THE US I MEAN NOT JUST THE PHONE PROPERTY. BUT THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE. SO VERY DIFFERENT CROWD YOU SEE IN THIS HEARING TODAY. IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT RATHER YOU TYPICALLY SEE OUT ON THE WEST STEPS OF THIS PARTICULAR CAPITAL OF THIS GREAT STATE. TO REALLY PARTNER WITH US TO MOVE AN AGENDA FORWARD THE MAKES THIS NOTION OF CALIFORNIA BEING OF GOLDEN STATE FOR ALL. REALITY. NOW CONCLUDE MY REMARKS WITH THAT THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER HEWITT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT -- THE CROWD WE SAW SOME OF THE WEST AFTER HEARING HIM IN THE HEARING OOM CERTAINLY LOOKS MORE LIKE CALIFORNIA. THEN THEN IN MANY INSTANCES ARE SYMBOL WE APPRECIATE YOU ON AND THE WORK OF YOU AND YOUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS ARE AT THE FOUNDATION FOR MAKING THIS POSSIBLE. NEXT I'D LIKE AARON. CLEARLY INTENDED PARTNER IF YOU WE'VE COMMITTED TO GO TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN JULY IN THE MIDDLE BY SUMMER BREAK YOU KNOW WE'RE DOWN FOR THE FIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU EVERYBODY OKAY. THEY'VE HEARD YOU LOUD AND CLEAR SENATOR SKINNER. WE'RE ONLY USING THESE MIKE'S NOT THOSE MIKE FOR NOT WORKING SO IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION I'M COULD YOU DON'T HAVE TO I WILL BUY FEWER PEOPLE WILL BE HERE NEXT TO ME THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT NEXT. WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM DOCTOR MARGOT. COMMERCIAL COMMERCIAL. THANK YOU CRUCIAL. THAT'S A CRUCIAL DIRECTOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO CENTER FOR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. HER RESEARCH FOCUSES ON THE CAUCUS ON THE CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES. OF PHARMACISTS AND HOUSING INSTABILITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING AND WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE DO A SOUND CHECK. THAT THEY CAN HEAR YOU. SURE EXCELLENT THANK YOU. Q. SENATOR MITCHELL SENATOR RUBIO SENATOR SKINNER -- THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO COME AND SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY MY NAME IS DOCTOR MARGOT COULD SHOW AND I'M A PROFESSOR OF EDICINE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE UCSF CENTER FOR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. I'M A PRACTICING GENERAL INTERNIST AT ZERO BURKE SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL HOSPITAL AND TRAUMA CENTER THE PUBLIC HOSPITAL OF THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO. AND I'M ALSO AN NIH FUNDED HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCHER WITH SUBSTANTIAL EXPERIENCE RESEARCHING HOMELESSNESS AND HEALTH. BEFORE I BEGIN MY REMARKS I WANT TO SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT WHY I A PHYSICIAN WHO PROVIDES CARE FOR ADULTS. IS HERE TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT THE NON MEDICAL DRIVERS OF HEALTH FOR CHILDREN. I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE MY RESEARCH AND CLINICAL WORK HAS SHOWN ME THAT I CAN HAVE A FAR LARGER INFLUENCE ON MY PATIENTS HEALTH. BY FOCUSING ON THEIR SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH THEN I CAN BY PROVIDING MEDICAL CARE. OF COURSE I BELIEVE HIGH QUALITY MEDICAL CARE IS IMPORTANT I BELIEVE DEEPLY AND PROVIDING ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE FOR ALL. BUT THE TRUTH IS TO MAKE THE LARGE ON HEALTH AND WELL BEING WE NEED TO FOCUS OUR ATTENTION ON THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. WELL IN MY CLINICAL PRACTICE I CARE FOR ADULTS AND NOT CHILDREN. I CAN TELL YOU THAT THERE'S NO BETTER WAY TO ENSURE THE HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITY CHILDREN'S IN ADULTS TOGETHER THEN TO WHO ATTEND TO THE NEEDS OF THE CHILDREN. AS WE LEARN MORE ABOUT THE LIFELONG DEVASTATING EFFECTS OF TOXIC STRESS ON CHILDREN'S LIVES. WE BETTER UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO CREATE THE CONDITIONS TO PROMOTE CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND WELL BEING ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO DO THIS IS BY ADDRESSING THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS. THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION DEFINES A SOCIAL DETERMINANTS AS THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH PEOPLE ARE BORN GROW LIVE WORK AND H.. THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE SHAPED BY THE DISTRIBUTION OF MONEY POWER AND RESOURCES. UPSTART I WILL DO THAT. SOCIAL DETERMINANTS THE NEW YORKER IN ME I'M SORRY VISUAL DETERMINANTS INCLUDE THINGS LIKE SAYS YOU ECONOMIC STATUS. EDUCATION. NEIGHBORHOOD AND PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT EMPLOYMENT SOCIAL SUPPORT NETWORKS AS WELL AS ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE WELL MANY EFFORTS TO INCREASE HEALTH AND HEALTH EQUITY HAVE FOCUSED ON CHANGING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS CAN BE MORE CAN DO MORE TO CREATE HEALTHY CHILDREN AND ADULTS. HEALTH CARE ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTES RELATIVELY SMALL PROPORTION TO OUR HEALTH. IT'S ESTIMATED THAT OUR GENETIC MAKEUP CONTRIBUTES 30% TO OUR OVERALL HEALTH. INDIVIDUAL BEHAVIOR 40% SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS 20%. AND HEALTH CARE 10%. HOWEVER EVEN THIS UNDERSTATES THE TRUE IMPACTS OF THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS. THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE LIVE HAS PROFOUND INFLUENCES NOT ONLY ON OUR HEALTH BEHAVIORS. BUT ALSO ON HOW OUR GENES ARE EXPRESSED AND WE KNOW THAT STRESS RELATED TO THE ENVIRONMENT IN THE EXPERIENCES THAT WE HAVE IN IT HAS PROFOUND EFFECTS ON BOTH THEIR BEHAVIOR AND OUR GENES. ENSURING FULL ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY HEALTH CARE WILL HELP. BUT ENSURING THAT PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO STABLE AFFORDABLE AND SAFE HOUSING. HOW FULL AND AFFORDABLE FOOD SAFE PLACES TO EXERCISE AND PLAY? ACCESSIBLE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AND HIGH QUALITY SCHOOLS MAY BE MORE IMPORTANT TO ENSURING HEALTH. AND WELLNESS. I WANT TO FOCUS MY REMARKS ON THE ROLE THAT SAFE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING HAS IN ENSURING HOUSE. WE NARROW FROM DECADES OF RESEARCH THAT HOUSING INSTABILITY AND HOMELESSNESS HAVE DEVASTATING IMPACTS ON HEALTH. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR CHILDREN. AS DOCTOR MACK DOES MANDA SOCIOLOGIST SAYS IN HIS GROUNDBREAKING WORK EVICTED WITHOUT STABLE SHELTER. EVERYTHING ELSE FALLS APART. IN THE UNITED STATES OVER HALF A MILLION PEOPLE HALF A MILLION PEOPLE ARE HOMELESS EVERY NIGHT. ONE THIRD OF ALL PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ARE PART OF A FAMILY WITH YOUNG CHILDREN. ONE IN FIVE HOMELESS PERSONS IN THE UNITED STATES IS A CHILD. FAMILIES EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OUR YOUNG FAMILIES. APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE CHILDREN. LIVING IN HOMELESS FAMILIES ARE UNDER THE AGE OF SIX ONE IN NINE ARE INFANTS LESS THAN A YEAR OLD. IN FACT THE MOST COMMON AGE IN WHICH A PERSON IS LIKELY TO STAY IN A HOMELESS SHELTER IN THE UNITED STATES IS AN INFANT LESS THAN. 112% OF THE NATION'S HOMELESS FAMILIES WITH MINOR CHILDREN LIVE IN CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA HAS THE SECOND HIGHEST NUMBER OF HOMELESS FAMILIES IN THE U.. WITH AN ESTIMATED TWENTY ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE EACH NIGHT BEING MEMBERS OF HOMELESS FAMILIES FAMILIES EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS CAN BE INVISIBLE TO THE PUBLIC. THEY ARE HIDDEN. HIDDEN AWAY IN HOMELESS SHELTERS. DOUBLED UP IN CROWDED AND UNSTABLE CONDITIONS WITH FRIENDS OUR FAMILIES. LIVING IN THEIR CARS IN ABANDONED BUILDINGS ARE IN HOTEL ROOMS. BUT THEIR LACK OF VISIBILITY DOES NOT PROTECT THEM IN ANY WAY FROM THE TERRIFYING RISKS OF HOMELESSNESS. WHEN WE THINK OF HOMELESSNESS IN CHILDREN WE THINK OF BOTH CHILDREN LIVING IN FAMILIES WHO ARE MOSTLY GOING TO SPEAK ABOUT? BUT WE ALSO THINK ABOUT UNACCOMPANIED YOUTH YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS AGED TWELVE TO TWENTY FIVE WHO EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS WITHOUT A PARENT OR GUARDIAN. APPROXIMATELY 11% OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ON ANY NIGHT OUR UNACCOMPANIED YOU. WHILE MOST ARE BETWEEN EIGHTEEN AND 2512% ARE UNDER. EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA HAS THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF UNACCOMPANIED YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. IN A SINGLE NIGHT IN JANUARY TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN THERE WERE OVER TWELVE THOUSAND UNACCOMPANIED YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA FOR ACCOUNTED FOR OVER HALF OF ALL ON SHELTERED HOMELESS YOUTH IN THE UNITED STATES. UNACCOMPANIED YOUTH FACE UNPARALLELED RISK THEY ARE HIGHER RISK OF SEXUAL TRAFFICKING OF SURVIVAL SACKS OF SUBSTANCE USE AND VICTIMIZATION. THEY FACE EXTRAORDINARY RISKS OF DYING FROM VIOLENCE OVERDOSE AND SUICIDE. UNACCOMPANIED HOMELESS YOUTH ARE SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE CITIZENS. TURNING BACK TO FAMILY HOMELESSNESS. THE PRIMARY. SING NEEDS MEANS THAT A HOUSEHOLD IS LOW INCOME SO THEY MAKE NO MORE THAN HALF OF THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME. DOES NOT RECEIVE ANY HOUSING BENEFITS LIKE HOUSING CHOICE VOUCHERS AND SPENDS MORE THAN HALF OF THEIR HOUSEHOLD INCOME ON RENT. FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN ARE THE LARGEST GROUP OF AMERICANS WITH HIGH WORST CASE HOUSING NEEDS. CASE HOUSING NEEDS ARE FAMILIES WITH YOUNG CHILDREN. THIS NUMBER HAS BEEN RISING AND CALIFORNIA HAS SOME OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF WORST CASE HOUSING NEEDS IN THE COUNTRY. FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN ARE ACTUALLY AT THE HIGHEST RISK OF ADDICTION. THEY'RE MORE LIKELY THAN HOUSEHOLDS WITHOUT CHILDREN TO REPORT DIFFICULTY PAYING RENT AND THEY'RE TWICE AS LIKELY TO FACE EVICTION. THIS IS PARTLY BECAUSE HOUSEHOLDS WITH CHILDREN HAVE DIFFICULTY BALANCING WORK WITH CHILD REARING AND THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO FACE LEAST VIOLATIONS DUE TO CONCERNS ABOUT OVERCROWDING NOISE DAMAGE OR SIMPLY COMPLAINTS ABOUT CHILDREN'S BEHAVIOR CHILDREN BEING CHILDREN. EXACTLY. THEY FACE ADDITIONAL BARRIERS WHEN LOOKING FOR NEW HOUSING AND FREQUENTLY HAVE TO MOVE IN WITH OTHER FAMILIES OR MOVE TO LOWER QUALITY HOUSING OR MOVE TO DISTRESSED NEIGHBORHOODS. EVEN IF THEY DON'T BECOME HOMELESS THIS CAN CREATE MANY HARDSHIPS INCLUDING DISRUPTIONS IN WORK FOR ADULTS IN SCHOOL FOR CHILDREN. FAMILY VIOLENCE IS A VERY FREQUENT PERCENT FOR TENT OF HOUSING LOST. MORE THAN 80% OF CHILDREN WOMEN WITH CHILDREN WHO ARE HOMELESS HAVE EXPERIENCED INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE. AND WE KNOW THAT PARENTS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED MORE ADVERSE CHILDHOOD ADVANCE WHEN THEY WERE CHILDREN ARE AT HIGHER RISK OF BECOMING HOMELESS AS ADULTS. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT OVER THREE QUARTERS OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS IN FAMILIES IDENTIFY EITHER AS NON WHITE OR IS WHITE LIGHT NEXT. OVER HALF OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCE IT IN FAMILIES EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS IDENTIFY AS BLACK AMERICANS. THIS IS ALMOST FOUR FOLD HIGHER THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION AND TWICE AS HIGH AS A REPRESENTATION OF BLACK AMERICANS LIVING IN POVERTY. IT IS SIMPLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DISK MEREKA. WITHOUT DISCUSSING THE INSIDIOUS ROLE THAT RACISM PLAYS IN CONTRIBUTING TO IT. PRIOR TO BECOMING HOMELESS CHILDREN IN HOMELESS FAMILIES ARE AT HIGHER RISK OF HAVING EXPERIENCED THE DEVASTATING EFFECTS OF POVERTY FOOD AND SECURITY PARENTAL DEPRESSION IN FAMILY VIOLENCE. THESE MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE TERRIBLE EFFECTS OF HOMELESSNESS ON CHILDREN'S HEALTH. HOMELESSNESS IN CHILDREN HAS BEEN LINKED TO A MYRIAD. OF NEGATIVE CHILD HEALTH OUTCOMES [inaudible] INCLUDING ASTHMA [inaudible] LEAD POISONING. RECURRENT INFECTIONS OBESITY DENTAL PROBLEMS DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS AND MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS. MORE THAN A QUARTER OF HOMELESS CHILDREN REPORT HAVING WITNESSED VIOLENCE. AND MORE THAN HALF A REPORTED TO HAVE ANXIETY OR DEPRESSION. FAMILIES EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ARE MORE LIKELY TO INTERACT WITH THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM THAN POOR FAMILIES WHO ARE HOUSE. HOMELESSNESS INCREASES THE RISKS FOR CHILDREN BEING PLACED OUT OF HOME. THESE SEPARATIONS CONTRIBUTE TO MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS INCLUDING ANXIETY DEPRESSION POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER AND CONDUCT DISORDER. HOMELESSNESS DIRECTLY AFFECTS CHILDREN'S ABILITY TO HAVE STABLE SCHOOLING. IT AFFECTS EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT AND IS ASSOCIATED WITH LOW LITERACY. CHILDREN WITHOUT STABLE HOMES ARE MORE THAN TWICE AS LIKELY TO REPEAT A SCHOOL GRADE. HAVE HIGH ACTIONS HE ISM DROP OUT OF SCHOOL OR BE SUSPENDED OR EXPELLED. CHILDREN IN HOMELESS FAMILIES ARE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE REGULAR HEALTH CARE. DESPITE THEIR HIGHER NEEDS THEY LACK ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE DENTAL CARE AND MENTAL HEALTH CARE AND THUS ARE MORE LIKELY TO USE THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AND TO BE ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL. HOMELESSNESS IS DEVASTATING TO HEALTH FOR BOTH ADULTS AND CHILDREN AND THERE IS SIMPLY NO MEDICINE AS POWERFUL. AS HOUSING. SO WHAT ARE THE BEST STRATEGIES TO RESPOND TO FAMILY HOMELESSNESS THE FAMILY OPTION STUDY WHICH WAS LAUNCHED IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT WAS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS. AND RELATIVE COSTS OF DIFFERENT INTERVENTIONS TO ASSIST FAMILIES EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. THEY LOOKED AT LONG TERM HOUSING SUBSIDIES SUCH AS HOUSING CHOICE VOUCHERS. PROJECT BASED TRANSITIONAL HOUSING. UP TO TWO YEARS OF HOUSING IN A BUILDING WITH EXTENSIVE SUPPORT SERVICES. COMMUNITY BASED RAPID RE HOUSING OR TEMPORARY RENTAL ASSISTANCE FOR UP TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND SERVICES THAT REALLY FOCUSED ON FINDING PERMANENT HOUSING. AND USUAL CARE. FAMILIES DID NOT GET ANY PRIORITY ACCESS IN USUAL CARE. BUT COULD USE ANY AVAILABLE SERVICES. IT IS RARE THAT WE HAVE SUCH RIGOROUS RE RESEARCH ON TOPICS REGARDING THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. THE FAMILY OPTIONS STUDY PROVIDES INSIGHT INTO BOTH THE F. FAX OF FAMILY HOMELESSNESS AND THE DEVASTATING EFFECTS. OF HOMELESSNESS. THE FAMILY OPTION STUDY RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TWENTY TWO HUNDRED HOMELESS FAMILIES INCLUDING MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND CHILDREN. IN TWELVE COMMUNITIES INCLUDING ONE IN CALIFORNIA TWO ONE OF THESE FOUR INTERVENTIONS. FAMILIES WERE ELIGIBLE IF THEY HAD STAYED FOR AT LEAST A WEEK AN EMERGENCY SHELTER. THE STUDY TRACKED THE FAMILIES FOR MORE THAN THREE YEARS TO ASSESS OUTCOMES RELATED TO HOUSING STABILITY FAMILY PRESERVATION ADULT AND CHILD WELL BEING. AND FAMILY SELF SUFFICIENCY. THE USUAL CARE GROUP TEACHES US WHAT HAPPENS TO FAMILIES WHO EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS IN THE REAL WORLD WITHOUT ANY SPECIAL INTERVENTION. ON AVERAGE THESE FAMILIES SPENT FOUR OF THE NEXT THIRTY SEVEN MONTHS. LIVING AND EMERGENCY SHELTER. MOST DID RECEIVE SOME FORMS OF SERVICES. 20% RECEIVED RAPID RE HOUSING AND 30% TRANSITIONAL HOUSING. AND OVER ONE THIRD EVENTUALLY GOT SOME FORM OF HOUSING VOUCHERS. DESPITE THIS AT THREE YEARS 39% REPORTED HAVING BEEN DOUBLED UP ARE HOMELESS IN THE PRIOR SIX MONTHS. 18% REPORTED BEING HOMELESS THREE YEARS AFTER THEIR ADDITION AND NATIONAL EPISODE. THE FAMILIES WHO RECEIVED HOUSING CHOICE VOUCHERS IMMEDIATELY AFTER RANDOMIZATION DID THE BEST BY FAR. THERE ARE HOUSING AND HEALTH OUTCOMES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN THE OTHER GROUPS. PEOPLE ASSIGNED TO THIS GROUP THE VOUCHER GROUP WHERE ONE HALF AS LIKELY TO HAVE ANY HOMELESSNESS EXPERIENCES IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS. SOME OTHER NOTABLE FINDINGS THOSE WHO RECEIVE VOUCHERS COMPARED TO THOSE IN USUAL CARE WHERE HALF IS LIKELY. TO EXPERIENCE FAMILY VIOLENCE IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS. AND THE ADULTS WERE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE SUBSTANCE USE PROBLEMS OR PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS CHILDREN EXPERIENCE FEWER SCHOOL MOVES LESS ABSENCES. AND FEWER BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS. IMPORTANTLY IN THE LONG TERM FAMILIES ASSIGNED TO RAPID RE HOUSING DID NOT FARE MUCH BETTER THAN FAMILIES ASSIGNED TO USUAL CARE. THOSE IN RAPID RE HOUSING HAD A SIMILAR LIKELIHOOD OF EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AT THE FILE WHAT POINTS AS THOSE WITH USUAL CARE. THOSE IN PROJECT BASED HOUSING HAD BETTER OUTCOMES IN THE SHORT TERM BUT NOT IN THE LONG TERM. THEY DID NOT EXPERIENCE BETTER WELL BEING THAN THOSE IN USUAL CARE. INTERESTINGLY THE TOTAL PROGRAM COSTS OF THOSE WHO RECEIVE VOUCHERS WAS ONLY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS THEN THOSE ASSIGNED TO USUAL CARE. THIS IS IN PART BECAUSE DOES IN USUAL CARE RECEIVED SOME OF THE SERVICES FOR INSTANCE SUMMIT COULD EVENTUALLY RECEIVE VOUCHERS. BUT IT'S ALSO BECAUSE SHELTER AND TEMPORARY PROGRAMS ARE EXPENSIVE. EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT EFFECTIVE. THERE'S MUCH MORE TO SAY ABOUT THE STUDY AND I CERTAINLY ENCOURAGE ENCOURAGE YOU TO READ IT. IT GIVES A SENSE OF BOTH THE ENORMOUS TOLL OF HOMELESSNESS ON FAMILIES AND PRESENTS A WAY FORWARD. IMPLEMENTING HOUSING VOUCHERS IS NOT AN EASY SOLUTION. CURRENTLY ONLY ONE IN FOUR HOUSEHOLDS NATIONWIDE THAT IS ELIGIBLE FOR VOUCHERS RECEIVE SPAM. AS YOU KNOW SECTION EIGHT EXACTLY. RAPIDLY AS YOU KNOW IN MANY OF OUR COSTLIEST REGIONS IN CALIFORNIA. EVEN WITH A VOUCHER IT CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT TO USE THAT. RAPID RE HOUSING IS LIKELY A READ REASONABLE OPTION TO STABILIZE FAMILIESWHILE WE AWAIT A MORE PERMANENT OPTION BUT THE DATA IS PRETTY CLEAR THAT IF WE COULD DO THE BEST THING IT WOULD BE TO GET THOSE FAMILIES VOUCHERS RIGHT AWAY. IT MAKES CLEAR THAT THE SOLUTION TO FAMILY HOMELESSNESS. IS HOUSING. WHEN WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE LIFELONG TOLL A FAMILY HOMELESSNESS ON CHILDREN'S WELL BEING? AND THE CLEAR AN EVIDENT SOLUTIONS TO COMMERCE MISS WE ARE COMPELLED TO ACT. AS A PHYSICIAN WHO CARES FOR LOW INCOME ADULTS I FEAR THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEE THE LIFELONG EFFECTS OF TOXIC STRESS ON HOMELESSNESS. FROM THESE CHILDREN WELL INTO THEIR ADULTHOOD. I CAN THINK OF NO BETTER INVESTMENT IN THE FUTURE OF THIS STATE THEN THE WELL BEING OF OUR CHILDREN. AND THE MEDICINE THAT ARCH STE IS SAFE AFFORDABLE AND PERMANENT HOUSING. THANK YOU. DOCTOR COASTAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- THIS. ONE QUICK QUESTION FROM SENATOR SKINNER. I'M DOCTOR CRUCIAL THANKS I'VE HEARD YOU BEFORE COULD YOU JUST GIVE US VERY BRIEFLY. A SENSE OF HOW DRAMATIC THE REDUCTION IN FEDERAL FUNDING IS BàN YET FOR THIS TYPE OF EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE OR OR EVEN ON GOING RENTAL ASSISTANCE YEAH IT'S ESTIMATED THAT YOU KNOW IN IN. ABOUT NINETEEN EIGHTY FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR HOUSING AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING THROUGH PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITIES OR THROUGH I'M SECTION EIGHT VOUCHERS WAS DRAMATICALLY CUT. SOME ESTIMATE THAT WERE NOW IN SORT OF REAL DOLLARS AND IT'S ABOUT A QUARTER OR 30% OF WHAT WE WERE IN REAL DOLLARS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY AND THEN WE WONDER WHY WE HAVE A HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. AND I THINK AS A PHYSICIAN A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT TO TALK TO ME ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH IS CAUSING HOMELESSNESS OR SUBSTANCE USE. AND I'M HERE TO SAY HOMELESSNESS RESULTS FROM A LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND IF YOU COUPLE THAT WITH ALL REDUCTION OF THE STATE IN TERMS OF OUR CAL WORKOUT RANTS WE IT'S ALSO THE REDUCTION IN INCOME FOR PEOPLE TO EVEN BE ABLE TO PAY FOR HOUSING EXACTLY AND WHEN THERE WAS THERE AND THE REDUCTION IN IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT AT I HAVE. ANDTHAT SORT OF THE CALIFORNIA THAT FROM THERE YEAH -- ONE OTHER. AND OF COURSE THEN IF WE ADD. TO THAT WERE WAY BEHIND IN TERMS OF NUMBER OF UNITS PER CAPITA YEAH THEN SCARCITY DRIVES UP PRICES SAQLAIN PRICES YOU COUPLE THAT WITH THE LACK OF ASSISTANCE THAT MIGHT BE NEEDED. THE WAY INCREASING PRICES AND THEN WE SEE THIS RISE IN HOMELESSNESS COULD YOU COMMENT JUST BRIEFLY -- I HAVE BEEN INTERACTING WITH A LOT OF BOTH THE PEOPLE WHO FAMILIES WHO ARE HOMELESS IN MY DISTRICT IN THERE AND SERVICE PROVIDERS. AND THEY'VE INDICATED THAT. THEY OFTEN HAVE VERY EXTREME DIFFICULTY IN TERMS OF SHELTERS YEAH THAT AND I I'M BRINGING THIS UP AND I WANT YOU TO COME IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE HAVE SORT OF BEEN PUSHING TOWARDS. EXPANDING SHELTERS BUT WHAT THE MAYOR YES BUT WHAT IT HERE. ANYWAY -- BUT WHAT. THE FEEDBACK I'M GETTING IS FOR EXAMPLE MANY SHELTERS. ARE -- SEX SEGREGATED THE HOMELESS MOTHER. HER SON IS TWELVE OR OLDER ALL THE SAID IN HER SON CAN'T BE IN SHELTERS SHE WANTS TO KEEP HER FAMILY TOGETHER RIGHT SO SHE STAYS IN THE CAR YEAH FOR SHE ANY NUMBER OF APPS LIKE THAT IF YOU COULD JUST. WRAP INCIDENTLY I MEAN I THINK A LOT OF HOMELESS FAMILIES ACTUALLY DON'T SHOW UP IN THEIR SYSTEM BECAUSE OUR SYSTEM WORKS SO POORLY FOR RIGHT NOW. AND SO THEY ARE HIT IN EITHER IN CARS OR THEIR SORT OF QUADRUPLED UP IN AN UNSAFE HOUSING ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE OUR SYSTEM IS REALLY NOT ORIENTED TOWARDS THEM. ONE OF THE REASONS I SPENT SOME TIME ON THE FAMILY OPTION STUDY IS IT ACTUALLY POINTS OUT THAT. SHELTERS ARE PRETTY EXPENSIVE AND I KNOW HOUSING IS REALLY HARD TO BUILD BUT I THINK WE NEED TO KEEP OUR EYES ON THAT AS OUR GOAL FOR THE SOLUTION. AS WELL AS LOOK AT EXIT THE EXISTING HOUSING STOCK IN THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT THE SECTION EIGHT LOOKING THAT VOUCHER PROGRAMS CENTER RUBIO. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THIS INFORMATION IT'S NOT REALLY HEARTBREAKING WHEN YOU SOME OF THE STATISTICS -- YOU KNOW HAVING BEEN ONE OF THESE OUT FAMILIES THAT CAN AFFORD HOUSING AND LIVED IN A SINGLE. YOU KNOW -- A UNIT WITH TWO OTHER FAMILIES GROWING UP YOU KNOW THE SIZE VERY PERSONAL TO ME BUT SECONDLY I THINK A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH DIGNITY AS WELL ON I WAS A FORMER TEACHERS I EXPLAINED AND I REMEMBER -- IT TOOK ME THREE WEEKS TO REAL TO DO WITH THAT DIGNITY OF LIFE I MEAN THEY FEEL SO -- IT'S DIFFICULT FOR THEM SOMETIMES TO REACH OUT WHEN THEY'VE HAD A STABLE ENVIRONMENT AND ALL THIS SUNDAY HAVE TO REACH OUT AND SAY I NEED HOUSING AND AND SO YES WE DID HAVE A LOT OF THE STUDENTS AND FAMILIES LIVING IN CARS AND AND IT'S REALLY HARD BECAUSE YOU. KNOW I FIND -- ALSO IS A FORMER COUNCILMEMBER WE USED TO OFFER VOUCHERS SOMETIMES FOR TEMPORARY HOUSING AND A LOT OF PEOPLE FELT LIKE IT WAS UP. ARE FALSE HOPE IN THAT YOU'D GET ON VOUCHERS FOR TEMPORARY HOUSING AND THEN THEY'RE BACK IN THE STREET AND SO THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO BOTHER GOING INTO HOTELS AND WE WOULD PROVIDE. BECAUSE IT WAS IN A SOLUTION SO SO HOPEFULLY TO THIS DIALOGUE WE WOULD FIGURE OUT A WAY TO FIND PERMANENT HOUSING AND TO YOUR RIGHT AND SOMETIMES A SHELTER OPTION WAS NOT AN OPTION. OUR FAMILY THAT FOUND THEMSELVES -- HOMELESS DID NOT WANT TO GO TO THESE SHELTERS THAT IT'S AN FOREIGN CONCEPT AND THEY'RE NOT USED TO IT BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE WORK THAT YOU DO IN THE RESEARCH THAT YOU DO. IF YOU WERE TO SPANISH. THE LETTER SEATED IBM ANY DOES THAT THE LAST TIME YES BECAUSE THEN I KEY IS MORE IMPORTANT ON TICKET THING I'M ASSIST A COMBAT SELFIE ON THIS THAT THEY MARKET IT CAN ALL SEEM OCT OCTOBER MOST. RCN THOUGH WE'RE NOT PERSONA QUE THAT GIVE YOU KNOW THAT ACCORDING TO OUR SOULS OUT THEM IN YOU GET A VETO NOT COST A COMBINED SO MEDIASCOPE CAN OPINION WITH EMAIL. SOMEONE THANK YOU BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE COMMERCE A FEW MINUTES BUT I MEAN WHAT I LEFT IT WITH YOU ON THAT THE LAST TIME YES. IF YOU MANY THOSE CUT OFF YES. WHAT YOU SAID RIGHT AND THANK YOU? INDULGING ME ONE LAST TIME BUT THE OTHER THING THAT AND DOCTOR CRUCIAL IF YOU IF YOU CAN VERIFY THIS OR NOT DOESN'T MATTER BUT ONE THING I JUST WANTED. TO BRING TO THE ATTENTION OF THAT MANY OF US THINK THAT THIS ONLY HAPPENS TO PEOPLE WHO ARE WERE REALLY HARD AND THEY'RE LIKE AND YOU KNOW THAT IS JUST WRONG AND I I SAY IT AS SOMEONE WHO. HAD A BRIEF AND TEMPORARY BOUT OF HOMELESSNESS AND MY DAUGHTER AND I DID LIVE IN MY CAMPER VAN. AND WE WERE I WAS IN A BETWEEN JOBS IN A PERIOD WHERE I WAS BETWEEN JOBS. AND THE SHAME OF AND YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE THE FIRST AND LAST SO YOU CAN'T GET INTO YOUR NEXT RENTAL UNIT. END. I WAS FORTUNATE I HAD A FRIEND BASE OF SAFETY NET THAT THEY COULD GIVE ME. MY DAUGHTER AND I LIVED WITH THEM FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME TILL I COULD GET THAT FIRST AND LAST AND THEN WE SECURED HOUSING WE'VE NOT HAD THE PROBLEM SINCE. BUT IT CAN HAPPEN TO ANYONE FOR ANY NUMBER OF REASONS. AND THEN OF COURSE IT SPIRALS. IN ANYWAY AT ABSOLUTELY I MEAN AND I THINK IN ARE REALLY DISTORTED HOUSING ENVIRONMENT CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW HAS ONLY TWENTY TWO UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR FAMILIES FOR EVERY HUNDRED FAMILIES. MAKING -- LAST SPEND THIRTY PER COME AND DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU LIVE 30% OF AREA MEDIUM IN SAN FRANCISCO IS ACTUALLY QUITE A HIGH SALARY. AND IT'S LIKE THAT CHILDHOOD GAME OF MUSICAL CHAIRS THERE SIMPLY ENOUGH HOUSING AND IT REALLY CAN AND DOES HAPPEN TO ANYBODY THE SHAME ISRAEL THE FEAR IS REAL BECAUSE PEOPLE'S CHILDREN ARE TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM. IF THEY ARE HOMELESS AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY FAMILIES DON'T WANNA PRESENT BECAUSE THEY FEAR THAT THEIR CHILDREN WILL BE REMOVED. THE TRAUMA IS REAL AND IT REALLY SPIRALS ON ITSELF BECAUSE WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE HOUSING YOU KNOW PEOPLE WIND UP LOSING THEIR JOB OR THEIR KIDS YOU KNOW MIGHT NOT WANT TO GO TO THE MOTEL BECAUSE IT MIGHT MEAN A DIFFERENT SCHOOL OR OR TWO YOU KNOW TRANSFERRING SO. IT'S A REALLY TERRIBLE PROBLEM THAT WE NEED. TO ADDRESS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES -- FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO SHARE YOUR PERSONAL STORIES BECAUSE I THINK WE HAVE A COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY TO RE EDUCATE MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUE SOMETIMES ABOUT THE TRUE FACE AND CAUSES OF HOMELESSNESS I APPRECIATE YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR.

FOURTEEN AND THAT SHELTERS POLICY WAS AT FOURTEEN YOU GO TO THE A SINGLE ADULT IDE OF THE SHELTER AND HOW THAT WAS UNTENABLE TO HER. AS A MOTHER OF A SON MY SON WAS FOUR TO YEAR AND I CAN ONLY IMAGINE AND SO. SHE COULD EXPLAIN TO MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE WHO ASK WHY DO YOU CHOOSE AIR QUALITY TO LIVE ON THE RIVER IN YOUR CAR. AND WHEN SHE WALKS THROUGH THE POLICIES IN THE RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT LIMITED HER TRUE OPTIONS IT WAS A HOPEFULLY I OPENING FOR EVERYONE ON THAT PANEL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE BINS JOINED BY SELECT COMMITTEE MEMBER CENTER COPYRIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU GO AHEAD. CHAIR MATCH ALL MEMBERS OF SELECT COMMITTEE MY NAME SEAMUS ROLLER IN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL HOUSING LAW PROJECT. I WAS HERE IN SACRAMENTO THIS WEEKEND MY PARENTS LIVE HERE AND I WAS TALKING WITH MY MOM. AND SHE REALLY SHE MOVED FREQUENTLY AS A CHILD -- DUE TO MY GRANDMOTHERS ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES AND ALCOHOLISM -- THE THEY MOVE VERY OFTEN WHEN SHE WAS VERY YOUNG IN. WHEN SHE WAS SEVEN SEVENTH GRADE SHE MOVED FROM MINNESOTA TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA? AND SHE WAS GETTING AN AWARD IN SEVENTH GRADE -- FOR FOR ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT AND SHE ONLY HAD ABOUT TWO WEEKS LEFT TO SECOND GRADE SEVENTH GRADE AND SHE WAS BANGING HER MOTHER -- TO ALLOW HER TO STAY THOSE LAST TWO WEEKS SO SHE CAN GET THE AWARD WHICH WAS IMPORTANT TO OUR AND FOR WHATEVER REASON MY GRANDMOTHER REFUSED AND MOVE THEM OUT TO CALIFORNIA -- TWO WEEKS BEFORE SEVENTH GRADE WAS OVER. MY MOM WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW IMPACTFUL THAT WAS FOR HER AND HOW PAINFUL IT WAS TO MOVE. AND HOW EACH TIME SHE MOVED THERE WERE PRIZED POSSESSIONS LEFT BEHIND AND FRIENDS LEFT BEHIND. AND SOCIAL NETWORKS THAT RIGHT THAT SHE WAS LEAVING BEHIND AS WELL. AND YOU KNOW THAT. IN HERE IN CALIFORNIA I THINK THAT YOU KNOW HOUSING STABILITY IS JUST DOESN'T BOIL DOWN TO COST ALONE THERE ARE MANY OTHER FACTORS FOR FAMILIES. THAT PLAY AND THAT OUR PERSONAL AND ECONOMIC AND COMMUNITY. BUT THE POINT I THINK WE'VE HAD IN CALIFORNIA IS IS THAT THE THE HOUSING COSTS ARE EATING UP PEOPLE'S INCOME. THAT THEY MAKE SMALL DECISIONS OR SMALL STROKES OF BAD LUCK IN THE CRISES IN A WAY THAT WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED TWENTY YEARS AGO IN CALIFORNIA. AND PUSH FAMILIES INTO INTO DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES -- YOU KNOW I COULD SPEND THE ENTIRE TIME KIND OF GOING THROUGH STATISTICS -- ON KIND OF HOW BAD IT IS IN CALIFORNIA BUT MY GUESS IS THAT MOST OF YOU KNOW SORT OF HOW BAD IT IS. IN YOUR OWN COMMUNITIES YOU'VE HEARD FROM OTHER PEOPLE. A COUPLE OF JUST. SMALL THINGS. THERE ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION HOUSEHOLDS IN CALIFORNIA THAT PAY MORE THAN HALF OF THEIR INCOME IN RENT. YEAH THOSE ARE HOUSEHOLD STAFF MORE THAN ONE PERSON AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST. YOU KNOW MAKING THOSE TOUGH DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO PAY -- FOR TEN POINT 9% OF ALL CSU STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS IN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS. TWENTY ONE OF THE THIRTY MOST EXPENSIVE RENTAL HOUSING MARKETS IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY ARE IN CALIFORNIA. THIS IS JUST A FEW I THINK OF THE DATA POINTS TO KIND OF DESCRIBE THE SITUATION WE FIND OURSELVES IN CALIFORNIA. IN ITS INTERSECTION I THINK WITH WITH HELP. HEALTHCARE IS A THREE POINT THREE TRILLION DOLLAR BUSINESS. IN THE UNITED STATES 90% OF THOSE COSTS ARE RELATED TO CHRONIC DISEASE AND MENTAL HEALTH. AND THOSE THINGS ARE CLOSELY TIED TO SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. AND THAT CHRONIC DISEASE IS DRIVEN. IN A GREAT DEAL BY POVERTY THAT'S FACED BY FAMILIES. AND DRIVES UP OUR HEALTHCARE COSTS -- BUT ALSO THAT THE REASON THAT WE PAY SO MUCH FOR HOUSING IS BECAUSE WE REFUSE TO SEE HOUSING AND THE OTHER SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AS PART OF THE HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM IN OUR COUNTRY. AND WITHIN OUR STATE. BUT IN ADDITION TO ALL THE HEALTH COSTS THERE ALSO THE VERY SIGNIFICANT COSTS ON OUR ECONOMY A COSTS IN THE QUALITY OF LIFE. AND JUST ON THE DESIRE OF PEOPLE TO REMAIN IN OUR STATE ALL TOGETHER. SO TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT I SEE IS THE ORIGINS OF PROBLEMS A HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA. IN IT SO OFTEN WE TALK ABOUT THE HOUSING MARKET BUT THAT THAT. THE HOUSING MARKET IN CALIFORNIA'S HIGHLY REGULATED THE GOVERNMENT INTERVENES IN SO MANY DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE PROCESS IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND AND AND HOW HOUSING IS REGULATED. SO IT THE PROBLEM I WANT TO BREAK IT DOWN INTO TWO BUCKETS THAT WE HAVE BOTH THE LACK OF HOUSING SUPPORTS THE LACK OF FUNDING. AND IT TOO WE HAVE PUBLIC POLICIES AS A WHOLE THAT HAVE MADE HOUSING MORE EXPENSIVE IN CALIFORNIA. IN A VERY BROAD LEVEL WE DESIGNED A HOUSING SYSTEM THAT MAXIMIZES BENEFITS FOR PEOPLE WHO ALREADY OWN PROPERTY. PEOPLE WITH WEALTH. REALTORS AND REAL ESTATE SPECULATORS. I KNOW THIS MAY SOUND LIKE A RADICAL STATEMENT IN SOME WAYS BUT IT'S ACTUALLY JUST THE FACTS. YOU CAN ARGUE ABOUT WHAT THE VALUES ARE THOSE DECISIONS ARE NOT BUT IN MANY WAYS AS A JUST FACTS ABOUT HOW WE DESIGN A HOUSING SYSTEM CALIFORNIA. I DON'T THINK THOSE THAT WE DECIDED THAT WE WANTED THAT OUTCOME BUT A SERIES OF SMALL DECISIONS PRODUCED THAT. WE'VE SEEN HUGE CUTS. IN FEDERAL AND STATE HOUSING PROGRAMS. WE SEE ON YEARS OF ZONING AND OTHER LAND USE CAN STARK CONTROLS. THAT HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO REINFORCE SEGREGATE DOES A CERTAIN WAY OF LIVING IN OUR STATE -- THAT WE'VE DECIDED TO LET THE DESIRES OF THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORS OVERRULED THE NEEDS OF THE REGION AND OF THE STATE. THAT WE'VE IMPOSED A VERY EXPENSIVE IDEA THAT THE ONLY ACCEPTABLE WAY TO LIVE IS IN A SINGLE FAMILY HOME IN THE SUBDIVISION. THAT WE'VE ZONED OUT MULTI FAMILY HOUSING WITH NO NOT RESIDENTIAL HOTELS ROOMING HOUSES. ANY OTHER WAYS THAT PEOPLE HAVE HISTORICALLY KEPT THEMSELVES OUT OF HOMELESSNESS WHEN THEY'RE ON THE EDGE. IT WILL DEVELOP THE TAX POLICY LIKE PROPOSITION THIRTEEN THE SKEW THE TAX MARKET THE PROVIDES HUGE BENEFITS TO PEOPLE THAT STAY IN THEIR HOMES FOR A LONG TIME. THE REDUCE IT PROPERTY TAX RATE AND FORCES TO PUT IMPACT FEES ON HOUSING THAT ARE TWO TO THREE TIMES. WHAT IT TAKES TO COVER THE COST OF SERVICES MORTGAGE INTEREST DEDUCTION THAT BENEFITS YOU THE HIGHER YOUR TAX BRACKET IS -- AND PROPERTY OWNERSHIP RULES ALLOW LOTS OF PEOPLE TO HOLD HOUSING AND LLC'S AND HIDE THE OWNERSHIP. AND ALLOWED LOTS OF PEOPLE FROM OTHER COUNTRIES TO LAUNDER THEIR MONEY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SO AS WE THINK ABOUT SOLVING THE HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA I THINK THEREFORE BUCKETS THAT I THINK ABOUT. ONE WE NEED TO INVEST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HOUSING SUPPORTS OVERALL. WE NEED TO ALTER THE TAX SYSTEM IN A WAY THAT. MAKES AN EQUAL PLAYING FIELD. FOR RENTERS AND FOR PEOPLE TRYING TO BUY HOMES. THAT WE NEED TO CREATE AN CENTRAL CREATE INCENTIVES FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO GREEN LIGHT MORE HOUSING PRODUCTION AND TO PUNISH EXCLUSIONARY ZONING. MUCH OF SILICON VALLEY FOR INSTANCE IS STILL DEVELOP LIKE IT'S A SUBURB OF OMAHA AND NOT LIKE IT'S A ONE OF THE BIGGEST JOB CENTERS. IN THE COUNTRY. I THINK THE GOVERNOR'S IDEA OF LOOKING HOUSING ELEMENT REFORM IS GREAT. BUT I THINK THAT ANY SOLUTION WE LOOK AT MUST REALLY TACKLE EXCLUSIONARY ZONING. AND IT CAN'T JUST BE FOCUSED ON OBSERVING BLACK AND BROWN NEIGHBORHOODS. AROUND THE STATE. AND LASTLY THAT WE NEED TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF TENANTS. AT THE VERY LEAST YOU SHOULDN'T BE AFFECTED IF YOU'RE PLAYING BY THE RULES AND PAYING YOUR RENT. AND THAT WE SHOULDN'T LET THE GROWTH OF CORPORATE LANDLORDS LIKE BLACKSTONE. FIND WAYS TO MONETIZE EVICTING. OUR RENTERS IN OUR STATE THAT WE NEED TO ENFORCE THE FAIR HOUSING LAWS THAT WE HAVE IN STRENGTH IN THOSE. IN SORT OF MY ADD ON TO THAT IS THAT THERE ARE THREE BIG SYSTEMS THAT INFLUENCE HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE CONTROLLED BY THE STATE. HEALTH CARE CHILD WELFARE AND CORRECTIONS AND THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE IN EACH OF THOSE SYSTEMS. TO LOWER THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ARE ENTERING INTO HOMELESSNESS. THERE ARE A WHOLE RANGE OF WAYS Y. IN WHICH YOU ALL AS A STATE GOVERNMENT CAN SHIFT THE NATURE OF THE HOUSING SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. BUT I THINK THE FIRST QUESTION IS ONE OF VALUES AND PRIORITIES WHAT THE OUTCOMES DO YOU WANT TO SEE. IS IT MORE IMPORTANT HOUSING REMAINS AN IN OR IS IT MORE IMPORTANT THAT OUR HOUSING POLICY WORKS TO PROVIDE STABLE HOUSING FOR THE MOST NUMBER OF FAMILIES. POSSIBLE [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I'M GONNA -- BE SURE TO ASK THAT ALL THE WITNESSES PROVIDE.

WITH YOU ALL THEY HAD NO IDEA THAT THINGS WERE AS BAD AS THEY WERE THAT MOM HAD PNEUMONIA AND WAS WORKING TWO JOBS AND CATCHING THE BUS IN DOING EVERYTHING THAT SHE COULD JUST TO SAVE UP MONEY. TO GET INTO A PLACE ANYWAY DID GET IN -- AND WAS THERE -- FOR ABOUT SEVEN YEARS BUT THE CHILDREN HAD TO BE MOVED BECAUSE THE PLACE IS A HOT SPOT. I'M IN THE CITY OF STOCKTON AND HAVE BEEN CONSISTENTLY A HOT SPOT. FROM THERE SO I STARTED LOOKING FOR A BETTER PLACE FOR US TO LEAH -- IT ALSO MEANT STAYING IN THAT PLACE I HAD TO WORK -- A LOT OF HOURS IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT I COULD CONTINUE TO PAY THE RENT. SO THAT WE DIDN'T EVER HAVE TO EXPERIENCE BEING HOMELESS AGAIN -- MY SECOND TOUCH WITH HOMELESSNESS -- WAS THE TWENTY FICTION -- NOW WE'VE MOVED JUST SO THAT YOU KNOW -- WITHIN A PERIOD OF TWENTY FIVE YEARS -- Là AB MOVES SIXTEEN TIMES.

TO PUT THINGS IN STORIES -- AND I HAD TO HURRY AND MOVE SO I HAD JUST A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME WE IN SHORT LOST EVERYTHING TO SQUATTERS WHILE WE STAYED. IN THE HOUSE TEMPORARILY AND FINALLY FOUND ANOTHER PLACE TO LIVE -- I'VE USED -- I'VE USED THE LIFETIME ASSISTANCE WITH TENNIS ONCE I'VE RECEIVED CENTRAL VALLEY HOUSING ASSISTANCE ONCE I RECEIVE CHURCH ASSISTANCE ONCE -- I'VE ALWAYS BEEN EMPLOYED LIKE I STATED OF SCHOOL TIME -- AND IN ORDER TO PUT I CELLS FROM.

WHICH WAS IN ANOTHER HOT ZONE IN STOCKTON -- ONCE SHE GOT EVICTED SHE ENDED UP STAYING WITH SOMEONE THAT WAS NOT SAFE SHE HAD TO SPLIT HER FOR HER THREE CHILDREN UP IN ORDER TO STAY WHERE SHE WS FINALLY LANDED.

I COULD NOT ASSIST THEM IN HELPING WITH THOSE THINGS THEY NEVER GOT COUNSELING FOR THE TRAUMA WE EXPERIENCE WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BECAUSE WE NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE STILL AND SETTLED LONG ENOUGH. IN ORDER TO ACTUALLY TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND EXHALE MY ADULT CHILDREN ARE NOW TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE TRAUMA. THAT WE HAVE HAD OVER ALL OF THE YEARS. OF BEING UNSTABLE AND I'M SURE. THAT THIS WAS NOT [inaudible] MY FAULT. AND THAT I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. TO QUALIFY FOR BEING IN THE POOL OF INSTABILITY. OTHER THAN NOT MAKE ENOUGH MONEY MUST WORK.

A GOOD AFTERNOON -- SENATOR MITCHELL AND MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE THANKS SO MUCH FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK -- MY NAME IS WILL A MAN I AM THE YOUTH COORDINATED ENTRY SYSTEM MANAGER AT THE LOS ANGELES HOMELESS SERVICES AUTHORITY OTHERWISE KNOWN AS LHASA. AND LHASA IS A JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY THE CITY AND COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES -- AND IS THE LEAD AGENCY FOR THE LA CONTINUUM OF CARE. AT LOS ALSO LEAD THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COORDINATED ENTRY SYSTEM -- OR SEE ASSN LOS ANGELES COUNTY THIS IS A COUNTY WIDE SYSTEM THAT STREAMLINES ACCESS TO HOUSING AND SERVICES FOR FAMILIES ADULT AND YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. AT MY TESTIMONY THIS AFTERNOON WILL FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON THE NEEDS OF YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS THAT IS -- INDIVIDUALS AGE. SIXTEEN TO TWENTY AND HOUSEHOLDS HEADED BY PERSONS IN THIS AGE GROUP. AS WELL AS RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ENSURING THAT EXPERIENCES OF HOMELESSNESS FOR THIS POPULATION BECOME INCREASINGLY RARE BRIEF AND NON RECURRING OR ONE TIME. AT SENATORS MITCHELL RUBY IN PARTICULAR IS YOU KNOW AND LA COUNTY. THE VOLUME OF NEED AMONG YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. IS SIGNIFICANT. ACCORDING TO LOSSES TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN YOUTH COUNT AN ESTIMATED THIRTY THREE HUNDRED YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT. THIS INCLUDES MEMBERS OF YOUNG FAMILIES AS WELL. NEARLY HALF 4407% OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE SLEEPING IN PLACES NOT MEANT FOR HUMAN HABITATION THAT INCLUDES THE STREETS. ENCAMPMENTS OR IN THEIR VEHICLES. OTHERS ARE STAYING IN SHELTER OTHER IN TERM HOUSING OR TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAMS. BUT STATEWIDE FIFTEEN THOUSAND YOUTH EXPERIENCE LITERAL HOMELESSNESS ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT. AND MORE THAN 20% RESIDE IN LA COUNTY. TWO MORE SYSTEMATICALLY ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF VALLEY'S YOUTH LHASA ALONG WITH CITY AND COUNTY PARTNERS AND YOU SERVICE PROVIDERS. IMPLEMENTED THE USE COORDINATED ENTRY SYSTEM IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN YOUTH THE S. IS AT LEAST COUNTY WIDE SYSTEM FOR IDENTIFYING ENGAGING AND ADDRESSING THE HOUSING NEEDS OF THE SPECIFIC POPULATION USING YOUNG ADULTS. THE SYSTEM CONNECTS PARTICIPANTS TO SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AND A MENU OF HOUSING RESOURCES BASED ON THE PARTICIPANTS NEEDS. AND PREFERENCES. INCLUDING TRANSITIONAL HOUSING RAPIDLY HOUSING NINE TIME LIMITED SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND OTHER PERMANENT HOUSING SUCH AS HOUSING CHOICE VOUCHERS. THANKS LARGELY TO A SIGNIFICANT INFLUX IN LOCAL RESORCES FOR MEASURE H. A COUNTY SALES TAX PASSED IN MARCH TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN PRODUCING THREE INNER FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR HOMELESS SERVICES. THROUGH. TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN LOS HAS SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED TE AVAILABILITY OF HOUSING RESOURCES SPECIFICALLY FOR THE YOUTH POPULATION OF THE LAST TWO YEARS. THIS INCLUDES THE ADDITION OF FOUR HUNDRED INTERMENT TRANSITIONAL HOUSING BATS FOR YOUTH. MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED RAPIDLY HOUSING SLOTS. SIGNIFICANT NEW PROJECT ANTENNA BASED PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. AND NEW HOUSING FOCUS SUPPORTIVE SERVICES -- INCLUDING SUPPORT FOR RECONNECTING AND REUNIFYING WITH FAMILY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE JUNCTION WITH THESE EXPANSIONS WE'VE SEEN THAT YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE FOUND HIGH RATES OF SUCCESS IN CERTAIN INTERVENTIONS. NEARLY 80% OF YOUTH RAPIDLY HOUSING PARTICIPANTS FOR EXAMPLE OF EXITED TO PERMANENT HOUSING SINCE THE INTERVENTION WAS SCALED COUNTY WIDE IN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHILE THE EXPANSION TO HOUSING AND SERVICES FOR YOUTH AND AND RELATIVE SUCCESS OF THESE HOUSING INTERVENTIONS ARE SIGNIFICANT. THE VOLUME OF NEED AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE IN LA COUNTY AND STATEWIDE CONTINUES TO FAR EXCEED THE SUPPLY RESOURCES. YOU SEE S. SERVED APPROXIMATELY FOUR THOUSAND ON DUPLICATED YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS IN CALENDAR YEAR. TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND WHILE THE SYSTEM SUPPORTED APPROXIMATELY ONE THOUSAND OF THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE TO MOVE INTO PERMANENT HOUSING NO SMALL FEAT. THOUSANDS OF OTHER PARTICIPANTS COULD NOT ACCESS PERMANENT HOUSING DUE TO THE INSUFFICIENT SUPPLY RESOURCES. WE MUST ENSURE ALL YOUNG PEOPLE CAN ACCESS SAFE AND STABLE HOUSING. AND THIS REQUIRES INCREASED INVESTMENTS IN BOTH INNER MAN PERMANENT HOUSING AS WELL AS HOUSING RELATED SUPPORTIVE SERVICES. ASSEMBLY BILL THREE OH SEVEN WHICH PROVIDES A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND ON GOING GRANT FUNDING TO LOCAL CEO SEES. AND YOU SERVICE PROVIDERS MAKE SUCH AN INVESTMENT IN ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE. SB. FIVE SIXTY EIGHT AUTHORED BY SENATOR PILOT PORTANTINO WHICH IS THAT WHICH IS A RAPIDLY HOUSING PROGRAM FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING INSTABILITY. WOULD ALSO MAKE SUCH AN INVESTMENT AND WITH THAT SUBPOPULATION COLLEGE STUDENTS. EXPERIENCING HIGH RATES OF HOMELESSNESS STATEWIDE. WITHOUT BUILDING THE INVENTORY OF HOUSING OPTIONS FOR YOUTH. FOCUSING PARTICULARLY ON SCALING INTERVENTIONS WITH HIGHER RATES OF SUCCESS SUCH AS RAPIDLY HOUSING. MANY OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE WILL CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS ANY THEM FOR LONGER AND LONGER DURATIONS. OUR INVESTMENTS IN HOUSING AND SERVICES FOR YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS SHOULD ALLOW COMMUNITIES THE FLEXIBILITY THEY NEED TO TAILOR SERVICES TO THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF YOUNG ADULTS. YOUNG PEOPLE OFTEN EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS DIFFERENTLY THAN THEIR ADULT COUNTERPARTS. THE MORE DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY AND THE REQUIRED DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE SERVICES AND ENGAGEMENT STRATEGIES. YOUNG PEOPLE OFTEN TIMES NEED MORE TIME TO STABILIZE AND HOUSING. AND BUILD THE SKILLS AND ASSETS THEY NEED TO ACHIEVE SELF SUFFICIENCY. LIKE AB THREE OH SEVEN ANY INVESTMENTS IN PROGRAMS AND SERVICES FOR YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS MUST ALLOW THE FLEXIBLE PROGRAM DESIGNS AND ENSURE SERVICES ARE TAILORED TO THE YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULT POPULATION. FURTHER WE MUST ENSURE THE SERVICES ARE LOW BARRIER. DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE TRAUMA AND FORMS AND CULTURALLY COMPETENT TO ENSURE THAT. YOUTH WHO ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED. BY EXPERIENCE OF HOMELESSNESS INCLUDING YOUTH OF COLOR LGBTQ YOUTH PARENTING YOUTH AND YOUTH EXPERIENCING MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES USING SUBSTANCES CAN ACCESS THESE SERVICES. TO ADDRESS YOUTH HOMELESSNESS IN OUR COMMUNITIES FROM A SYSTEM LANDS. IT'S ALSO IMPERATIVE THAT WE LOOK TO THE MAINSTREAM SYSTEMS THAT PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN BOTH PREVENTING EXPERIENCES OF YOUTH HOMELESSNESS. AND CONTRIBUTING TO YOUNG PERSONS PATHWAY OUT OF HOMELESSNESS. AMONG THE MOST IMPACTFUL MAINSTREAM SYSTEMS ON THE OVERALL LANDSCAPE OF YOUTH HOMELESSNESS IS CHILD WELFARE. STILL A STUDIES ON THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN YOUTH HOMELESSNESS AND FOSTER CARE STATUS HAVE FOUND THAT CURRENT AND FORMER FOSTER YOUTH EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS AT HIGHER RATES THAN THEIR PEERS. MANY YOUNG PEOPLE EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS IMMEDIATELY OR SOON AFTER EXITING. CARE PARTICULARLY YOUTH AGING OUT OF FOSTER CARE INCLUDING EXTENDED FOSTER CARE. ONE STUDY FOUND THAT 22% OF YOUTH EXITING THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM IN THREE MIDWESTERN STATES INCLUDING ONE STATE WITH EXTENDED FOSTER CARE. EXPERIENCE AT LEAST ONE EPISODE OF HOMELESSNESS WITHIN ONE YEAR OF EXITING THE SYSTEM. THE PIPELINE FROM FOSTER CARE YOUTH HOMELESSNESS IS CERTAINLY PARENT LA COUNTY. WHERE MORE THAN 40% OF THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOUTH COURT EIGHT ENTRY SYSTEM REPORT THAT THEY'VE HAD A SOCIAL WORKER IN THEIR LIFETIME? A PORTION OF WHOM WOULD HAVE EMANCIPATED AT AGE NINE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN OR TWENTY OR WOULD HAVE AGED OUT OF THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM AT TWENTY ONE LASSEN COUNTY PARTNERS ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH -- LA COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES TO ENSURE GREATER HOUSING STABILITY FOR YOU THAT THEY ACTUALLY CARE BY ENHANCING THE DISCHARGE PLANNING PROCESS AND INTEGRATING A SEAMLESS CONNECTION TO HOUSING RESOURCE. THREE THREE USED YOUTH THE S. WHERE APPROPRIATE AS YOUNG PEOPLE ACTED CARE. HOWEVER THE REMAINS THE NEED FOR A TRIAL OUR CHILD WELFARE SYSTEMS TO MAKE GREATER INVESTMENTS IN AND REDUCE BARRIERS TO THE SHORT. MEDIUM AND LONG TERM HOUSING STABILITY FOR KERR. THIS IS MOST CRITICAL FOR YOUTH AND EXITED FOSTER CARE AS YOU STATEWIDE OF ELECTED TO REMAINING CARE UNTIL THEY'RE TWENTY FIRST BIRTHDAY. AT A SIGNIFICANT RATE. IN FISCAL YEAR 272-201-71880 2% OF YOUNG PEOPLE REMAINED AN EXTENDED FOSTER CARE UPON TURNING. EIGHTEEN THAT'S HIGHER THAN THE TAKE OPERATE THAT THE STATE HAD ORIGINALLY ANTICIPATED WHEN IMPLEMENTING SENATE VOTES CURRENT. TWENTY TWELVE WELL IT'S ENCOURAGING THAT YOUNG PEOPLE pARE CHOOSING TO REMAIN IN CARING CONTINUE TO ACCESS THE SERVICES. SUCH SIGNIFICANT PARTICIPATION HAS EXACERBATED SHORTAGES OF IN HOUSING RESOURCES AND HOUSING RELATED SUPPORTIVE SERVICES FOR YOUTH IN CARE. IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE RESOURCE AND WORK WITH OUR PUBLIC CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES TO BOTH ADDRESS THE SHORTAGES AND ENSURE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE BETTER SUPPORTED. REMAIN STABLE HOUSE AFTER THE ACCIDENT. ON THE SYSTEM. AB. FIVE THIRTY ONE AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN AND SPONSORED BY CHILDREN NOW AN ALLIANCE FOR CHILDREN'S RIGHTS. WE TAKE AN IMPORTANT STEP IN ENSURING COUNTY PUBLIC CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES COMPREHENSIVELY ASSESS THE IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM HOUSING NEEDS OF YOUTH AND EXTEND FOSTER CARE. AND MAKE INVESTMENTS TO ADDRESS THESE HOUSING NEEDS. IN SUMMARY I'D LIKE TO CLOSE WITH THREE RECOMMENDATIONS. FIRST WE MUST CLOSE THE GAP BETWEEN THE LEVEL OF NEED AMONG YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS FOR HOUSING RESOURCES AND SERVICES. AND A LIMITED SUPPLY OF SUCH RESOURCES. SECOND OUR INVESTMENTS IN THESE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. SHOULD ALLOW COMMUNITIES THE FLEXIBILITY TO ADDRESS THEIR PART MOST PRESSING NEEDS SHOULD BE TAILORED TO THE DEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE. AND SHOULD BE LOW BARRIER TRAUMA INFORMED AND CULTURALLY COMPETENT. THIRD AND FINALLY WE MUST WORK WITH OUR MAINSTREAM SYSTEMS SUCH AS CHILD WELFARE WHICH SERVE AS A FEEDER INTO AN A PATHWAY OUT OF HOMELESSNESS FOR YOUTH. TO RE ORIENT THEMSELVES TOWARDS THE HOUSING NEEDS OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE THEY SERVE. THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF MY NAME'S ALEXANDER HERNDON I'M A HOUSING POLICY ADVOCATE WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. THE WESTERN CENTER SERVES LOW INCOME CALIFORNIA'S IN THE AREAS OF HEALTHCARE PUBLIC BENEFITS AND HOUSING -- AND PRIOR TO JOINING WESTERN CENTER I I WORKED AS A LEGAL AID ATTORNEY IN LOS ANGELES ON HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT ISSUES [inaudible] GOOD OKAY I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING YOU FOR CONVENING THIS COMMITTEE -- AND HOLDING THIS HEARING ON ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S MOST PRESSING ISSUES. OUR HOUSING CRISIS HAS AFFECTED OUR ENTIRE STATE BUT IS HIT HARDEST FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES STRUGGLING TO KEEP UP WITH RISING RENTS AND A LACK OF AVAILABLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. CALIFORNIA PRIDES ITSELF ON ITS PROGRESSIVE VALUES AND PROVIDING A PATH TO SUCCESS FOR CHILDREN REGARDLESS OF THEIR BACKGROUND -- AND STABLE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES ARE A CRITICAL COMPONENT TO ENSURING THIS VISION IS REALIZED. HOWEVER OUR HOUSING CRISIS IS MAKING THE CALIFORNIA DREAM IMPOSSIBLE FOR OUR LOWEST INCOME FAMILIES EVEN WHEN THEY'RE ABLE TO SECURE A SYSTEMS THE PROMISES TO HELP THEM AFFORD AN APARTMENT ON THE PRIVATE MARKET. MANY FAMILIES ARE UNABLE TO FIND HOUSING EVEN WITH HOUSING ASSISTANCE DID A BLANKET POLICIES OF LANDLORDS. WHO REFUSED TO LET THEM APPLY FOR HOUSING EVEN IF THE ASSISTANCE MEANS THEY CAN AFFORD THE RENT? I HAVE PERSONALLY COUNCIL COUNTLESS TENANTS STRUGGLING TO FIND A LAND LORD WILLING TO ACCEPT A HOUSING VOUCHER OR OTHER ASSISTANCE. BEFORE THEY'RE FORCED TO RETURN IT ON USE. THIS IS BEEN ESPECIALLY FRUSTRATING FOR CERTAIN GROUPS OF TENANTS INCLUDING THOSE WITH CHILDREN. WHO COUNT ON THIS ASSISTANCE -- TO SHIELD THEM FROM THE UNCERTAINTY AND DISRUPTION OF LIVING IN AN UNSTABLE ENVIRONMENT. WE'VE HEARD FROM PREVIOUS SPEAKERS POWERFUL STORIES ABOUT THE EFFECTS THAT HOUSING AND SECURITY HOUSE ON YOUNG CHILDREN. AND THIS IS REFLECTED IN THE FACES OF PARENTS I MET WHO WORRY. ABOUT THEIR CHILDREN BEING DISTRACTED FROM SCHOOL AND FAMILY NETWORKS SUBJECTED TO THE STRESS OF AN UNSUITABLE ENVIRONMENT. OR FORCED INTO HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T FIND A LANDLORD WILLING TO ACCEPT THEIR ASSISTANCE. AS WE WORK TO ADDRESS OUR HOUSING CRISIS WE MUST PRIORITIZE SOLUTIONS THAT ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THOSE MOST VULNERABLE TO ITS EFFECTS. BUILDING MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WILL TAKE TIME AND STRUGGLING FAMILIES RIGHT NOW DON'T HAVE TIME TO WAIT A CHILD CANNOT PUT THEIR CHILDHOOD ON HOLD WHILE WE BUILD ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNIT. OR WAIT FOR THE MARKET TO ADJUST. AND SOLUTIONS THAT ALLOW LOW INCOME FAMILIES TO ACCESS EXISTING HOUSING OR CRITICAL COMPONENT TO ENSURING THEIR CHILDREN SUCCEED. TO THAT END SB THREE TWENTY NINE THE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES OCT REPRESENTS A KEY SOLUTION THAT CAN HELP STRUGGLING FAMILIES RIGHT NOW. WHILE WE ADDRESS HOUSING SUPPLY. THE BILL WOULD INSTITUTE A PROVEN SOLUTION BY INCLUDING HOUSING ASSISTANCE AS A PROTECTED SOURCE OF INCOME UNDER THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT. AND THE EFFECT OF THIS CHANGE WOULD BE TO PROHIBIT DISCRIMINATION AGAINST FAMILIES BASED ON THE FACT THAT THEY RECEIVE HOUSING ASSISTANCE. I AM WOULD REQUIRE THAT ASSISTANCE TO BE TREATED THE SAME AS ANY OTHER FORM OF INCOME. THIS MEANS THAT WHILE LANDLORDS COULD STILL SCREEN ASSISTED FAMILIES USING THE SAME CRITERIA THEY USE FOR ANY OTHER HOUSING APPLICANT. THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BAR THESE FAMILIES FROM APPLYING JUST BECAUSE THEY GET HELP PAYING THE RENT. SB THREE TWENTY NINTHS CHANGE TO SEE HOW I WAS LISTED AS THE NUMBER ONE HOUSING RECOMMENDATION OF THE LIFTING FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN OUT OF POVERTY TASK FORCE. AND IT'S AND THE POLICY HAS A PROVEN RECORD OF SUCCESS WHERE IT'S BEEN IMPLEMENTED. ELEVEN STATES AND OVER FIFTY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS INCLUDING SEVERAL IN CALIFORNIA. HAVE IMPLEMENTED SOURCE OF INCOME PROTECTIONS AND THEIR EFFECT ON THE ABILITY OF FAMILIES TO SUCCESSFULLY OBTAIN STABLE HOUSING HAS BEEN DRAMATIC. A RECENT STUDY BY THE US DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT FOUND THAT WITHOUT SOURCE OF INCOME PROTECTIONS APPROXIMATELY 77%OF FAMILIES WERE REJECTED BY LANDLORDS AND UNABLE TO USE THEIR SECTION EIGHT VOUCHERS. IN JURISDICTIONS WITH THIS POLICY IN PLACE. THAT REJECTION RATE PLUMMETED IN ADDITION RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE POLICY CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE ABILITY OF ASSISTED FAMILIES TO ACCESS LOW POVERTY HIGH OPPORTUNITY NEIGHBORHOODS. IN CALIFORNIA OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS RECEIVE SECTION EIGHT ASSISTANCE ALONE. AND MANYMORE RECEIVE ASSISTANCE -- THROUGH OTHER PROGRAMS INCLUDING THOSE ADMINISTERED BY THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS -- AND WITH A RANGE OF JURISDICTION STEPPING UP TO ADDRESS OUR HOUSING CRISIS THROUGH THESE PROGRAMS IT'S ESSENTIAL THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT THAT ASSISTANCE CAN ACTUALLY BE USED BY NEEDY FAMILIES. HOUSING ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS HELP FAMILIES AFFORD RENT ON THE PRIVATE MARKET AND ACCESS AREAS OF OPPORTUNITY BY REQUIRING RECIPIENTS TO PAY ABOUT 30% OF THEIR INCOME IN RENT. AND THE REMAINDER OF THE RENT IS PROVIDED BY A LOCAL HOUSING AUTHORITY OR OTHER AGENCY DIRECTLY TO THE LANDMARK. THIS ALLOWS FAMILIES TO ENSURE THEY'RE SUFFICIENT INCOME LEFT OVER AFTER PAYING THE RENT -- TO PAY FOR BASIC NECESSITIES SUCH AS FOOD AND MEDICAL CARE% TRANSPORTATION AND CLOTHING AND TURN ALLOWING THEIR CHILDREN TO FOCUS ON THEIR EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT. WHEN FAMILIES ARE ABLE TO COMFORTABLY AFFORD THEIR RENT RESEARCH SHOWS THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO MAKE EXPENDITURES ON HEALTH CARE AND HEALTHY FOOD INCREASING RANGE OF HEALTH THE HEALTH AND EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES FOR THEIR CHILDREN? IN ADDITION HOUSING ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS PROTECT CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND OUR OVERALL HOUSING STOCK. BY PERFORMING A BASIC INSPECTION OF EACH ASSISTED UNIT TO ENSURE IT MEETS THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS FOR HEALTHY HOUSING. AS A RESULT OF THE STABILITY PROVIDED BY AFFORDABLE AND PREDICTABLE HOUSING COSTS LOW INCOME FAMILIES WITH HOUSING ASSISTANCE TYPICALLY REMAIN IN THEIR UNITS LONGER THAN THE AVERAGE TENANT PROVIDING CERTAINTY TO PARTICIPATING LANDLORDS. SOME JURISDICTIONS HAVE FOUND THAT WHILE LOCAL LANDLORDS WERE INITIALLY RESISTANT TO A SOURCE OF INCOME POLICY. ONCE IT WAS IN PLACE THEY WERE SATISFIED WITH THE GUARANTEED ON TIME PAYMENTS RECEIVED UNDER THESE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. BOTH FROM TENANTS MORE ABLE TO AFFORD THEIR PORTION OF THE RENT AND FROM GOVERNMENT AGENCIES ENSURING THE REMAINDER IS PAID IN FULL AND ON TIME. THE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES ACT PROVIDES A CHANCE FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES WITH HOUSING ASSISTANCE TO ACCESS HIGH OPPORTUNITY NEIGHBORHOODS AND STABLE HOUSING. LEADING TO IMPROVED OUTCOMES FOR THEIR CHILDREN BY ENSURING THEY'RE ABLE TO APPLY FOR HOUSING IN THE SAME WAY OTHER FAMILIES CAN. STRUGGLING CALIFORNIANS SHOULD NOT BE FORCED TO GIVE UP THEIR HOUSING ASSISTANCE SIMPLY pLORD WILLING TO ACCEPT IT PUTTING THEIR CHILDREN AT RISK. THE WESTERN CENTER APPLAUDS LEGISLATURE'S ATTENTION TO THESE CRITICAL ISSUES AND ENCOURAGES YOUR SUPPORT OF SB THREE TWENTY NINE AND OTHER MEASURES TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN LIVING IN POVERTY ARE PROTECTED FROM DISCRIMINATION. AND ARE ABLE TO GROW UP IN A STABLE HEALTHY AND AFFORDABLE HOME THANK YOU. COLLEAGUES. MR HARDEN WOULDN'T GIVE ME ANY LOVE BUT I WANT TO KNOW THE THREE TWENTY DIED AS A MITCHELL BILL SO I HOPE I CAN COUNT ON YOUR SUPPORT. AND TO THE FINAL WORD TODAY WILL BE FROM OUR LA ELS OFFICE. AND HAULING TO IT THANK YOU IN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- SO YOU SHOULD HAVE A HAND OUT IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY THAT I'LL BE SPEAKING FROM. I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE PROPER COMMENT PROGRAM WHICH IS A SPECIFIC PROGRAM BUT IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS BROADER CONVERSATION THAT YOU'RE HAVING. ABOUT HOUSING AFFORDABILITY PARTICULARLY FOR FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN -- IT SO THE PROPERTY TAX POSTPONEMENT PROGRAM IS ONE THAT IS CURRENTLY ADMINISTERED BY THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE AND ALLOW CERTAIN ELIGIBLE HOMEOWNER'S. TO DEFERRED THE PAYMENT OF THEIR PROPERTY TAXES INDEFINITELY. THE WAY THIS WORKS IS -- A HOMEOWNER WILL APPLY TO THE STATE IF THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM THE STATE WILL PAY THEIR PROPERTY TAX PAYMENTS DIRECTLY ON THEIR BEHALF WITH THE COUNTY. THE HOMEOWNER DOES NOT NEED TO REPAY -- AND LAST THEY MOVE OUT OF THEIR HOME OR SELL THE HOME R THE HOME IS AND HEARD IT OR THERE'S SOME OTHER CONDITIONS -- BUT THE HOMEOWNER DOES EVENTUALLY REPAIR THEIR ERRORS WOULD REPAY THE STATE WITH INTEREST FOR THE PROGRAM. SO TURNING TO THE FIRST PAGE OF THE HANDOUT I'M JUST TO GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF CONTACTS BUT TWO IS TO START. AND THEN ALL DELEGATED TO SPECIFICALLY OUR EVALUATION OF THE PROPERTY TAX POSTPONEMENT AND HIGHLIGHTS AND KEY ASPECTS OF THE EVALUATION IN LIGHT OF THIS -- THIS BROADER DISCUSSION. SO -- OF COURSE AS YOU'VE BEEN DISCUSSING A HOUSING IS VERY EXPENSIVE IN CALIFORNIA -- PROPERTY TAX PAYMENTS ARE SOMEWHAT LESS SO AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF PROPOSITION THIRTEEN WHICH LIMITS THE GROWTH OF THE ASSESSED VALUE OF A PROPERTY OVER TIME. ALTHOUGH PROPERTY TAXES PAID ARE STILL ABOVE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE -- IN CALIFORNIA. SO THE PROPERTY TAX POSTPONEMENT% PROGRAM HELPS OR TO THEIR PROPERTY TAXES IF THEY MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA. THE FIRST IS THAT THEY HAVE TO BE OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY TWO BLIND OR DISABLED. THE SECOND IS THAT THEY HAVE TO HAVE HOUSEHOLD INCOME LESS THAN THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS MONTH. PER YEAR EXCUSE ME THAT WOULD BE CRAZY -- AND FINALLY THEY HAVE TO OWN AT LEAST 40% EQUITY IN THEIR HOMES. SO THE TABLE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE AGE JUST PROVIDES OUR OFFICES EVALUATION OF THIS PROGRAM AND I'M NOT GONNA TALK THROUGH EACH OF THESE -- CRITERIA SPECIFICALLY BUT JUST HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE ONES THAT ARE PARTICULARLY RELEVANT FOR THIS CONVERSATION. SO ON ELIGIBILITY WE FIND THAT -- THIS INCOME ELIGIBILITY THRESHOLD FOR THE P. FOR PTP. IT DOES NOT VERY BY HOUSEHOLD SIZE IT IS NOT VERY BY GEOGRAPHY AND IT DOES NOT VERY OVER TIME TO ACCOUNT FOR INFLATION. THERE'S OBVIOUSLY SOME CHALLENGES HERE THE FIRST BEING AT THAT LARGER HOUSEHOLDS ARE ARE CLEARLY GOING TO NEED MORE RESOURCES TO MEET THE EXPENSES -- UP ALL OF THEIR OF ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THEM SO A FAMILY OF SIX IS OBVIOUSLY GOING. TO YOU KNOW PERHAPS HAVE MORE AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES THAN A FAMILY OF ONE OR TWO AND THEN ALSO WE FIND A LOWER INCOME HOMEOWNERS PAY MORE AS A SHARE OF THEIR INCOME TOWARD PROPERTY TAXES IF THEY LIVE IN HIGH COST. AND HIGH INCOME AREAS OF THE STATE IN OTHER AREAS SO IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE SIMILAR TO OTHER HOUSING PROGRAMS FOR THE TOP INCOME THRESHOLD TO VARY BY GEOGRAPHY. ON THE AGE LIMIT SPECIFICALLY WE FIND THE YOUNGER HOMEOWNERS COULD PROBABLY BENEFIT JUST AS MUCH IF NOT MORE FROM THIS PROGRAM IS OLDER HOMEOWNERS. TO AND THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT -- LOW INCOME HOMEOWNERS IN THEIR FORTIES AND FIFTIES ACTUALLY PAY A MUCH HIGHER SHARE OF THEIR INCOME TOWARD PROPERTY TAX PAYMENTS THAN THOSE WHO ARE OVER. SIXTY BASICALLY BECAUSE OF PROP THIRTEEN AGAIN RIGHT THE LONGER THAT YOU'VE ON THE HOME ON THE LOWER YOUR AFFECTED PROPERTY TAX PAYMENT IS GOING TO BE. AND SO WE WOULD JUST SAY THAT PERHAPS THE P. T. P. INCOME ELIGIBILITY COULD BE EXPANDED TO PEOPLE BELOW THE AGE OF SIXTY TWO BUT THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A NEXUS HERE SPECIFICALLY FOR FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN ONE BEING THAT MULTI GENERATIONAL HOUSEHOLDS ARE GOING TO BE LESS LIKELY TO BE ABLE. TO QUALIFY UNDER THE CURRENT CONSTRUCTION OF THE PROGRAM BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S INCOME IN THE HOUSEHOLD COUNTS TOWARDS THE LIMIT. AND THE SECOND BEING THAT OF COURSE CHILDREN TIME TO LIVE IN HOMES WHERE THE HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD IS UNDER THE AGE OF SIXTY TWO AND SO EXPANDING THE INCOME ARE THE AGE ELIGIBILITY. IS POSSIBLY GOING TO BENEFIT FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN AS WELL -- JUST QUICKLY ON AFFORDABILITY IN THE BUDGETARY ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAM. THE P. T. P. INTEREST RATE IS 7% WHICH WE FIND IS TOO HIGH -- ALTHOUGH I WOULD NOTE THAT AFFORDABILITY OF THIS PROGRAM IS ACTUALLY A BIT -- BETTER THAN COMPARABLE PROGRAMS LIKE REVERSE MORTGAGES REVERSE MORTGAGES TEND TO BE ACTUALLY EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE THAN PCP. AND ON THE BUDGETARY ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAM PTP DOES NOT KERRY COST TO TAXPAYERS THAT'S BECAUSE REPAYMENTS ON OUTSTANDING LOANS COVER THE COST OF MAKING NEW LOANS TO NEW PARTICIPANTS -- AND ACTUALLY PTP PROVIDE THE GENERAL FUND BENEFIT. THERE IS -- A FUN TO THAT FUNDS ACCESS OF A CERTAIN LIMIT IS SWEPT TO THE GENERAL FUND SO RATHER THAN GENERAL FUND TAXPAYERS SUPPORTING PT PPTP IS SUPPORTING. GENERAL FUND TAXPAYERS. THE FINAL PAGE ARE JUST PRESENTS SOME ALTERNATIVES TO CHANGE PTP IN LIGHT OF THIS EVALUATION I'M NOT GOING TO WALK THROUGH THIS -- IN DETAIL FOR THE SAKE OF TIME. BUT I'LL JUST HIGHLIGHT SOME SPECIFIC -- IDEAS HERE ADVANCES US SOME SPECIFIC CHANGES THAT MIGHT NEED TO BE MADE WITH RESPECT TO AFFORDABILITY AND GENERAL FUND SUPPORT SPECIFICALLY. SO THE FOUR DIFFERENT CATEGORIES ARE MAINTAINING ELIGIBILITY AS IT EXISTS CURRENTLY CHANGING INCOME THRESHOLD SO THAT THEY WOULD VERY BY HOUSEHOLD SIZE ARE VERY BY GEOGRAPHY AND VERY OVER TIME. POSSIBLY ALSO RAISE THE AVERAGE INCOME THRESHOLD A BIT BECAUSE THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED IS QUITE LOW. ALLOWING YOUNGER HOMEOWNERS TO PARTICIPATE WHICH THERE ARE SOME TECHNICAL ASPECTS HERE BUT THAT COULD POSSIBLY REQUIRE A CONSTITUTIONAL REVISION THIS PROGRAM IS -- I WAS CREATED ORIGINALLY UNDER THE CONSTITUTION -- AND THEN OF COURSE YOU COULD MAKE BOTH OF THESE CHANGES SO IN TERMS OF THE INTEREST RATE WE THINK THE INTEREST RATE COULD BE LOWER -- IN VARIOUS PERMUTATIONS OF THIS PROGRAM PARTICULARLY IF YOU WERE JUST MAKING CHANGES AROUND ELIGIBILITY OP WITH RESPECT TO INCOME. BUT WITH RESPECT TO ALLOWING YOUNGER HOMEOWNERS TO PARTICIPATE IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THIS WOULD INTRODUCE SOME ADDITIONAL RISK TO THE STATE. AND THAT'S BECAUSE YOUNGER HOMEOWNERS ARE GONNA TEND TO HOLD THESE LOANS FOR A LONGER AND POSSIBLY -- MEAN THAT THE THE VALUE OF THE LOAN WILL EXCEED THE VALUE OF THE EQUITY THAT THEY HOLD IN THEIR HOME. AND SO AS A RESULT WE HAVE JUST A COUPLE OF RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND LIMITING STATE RISK -- AT THAT COULD KEEP THE FIND GENERALLY SELF FUNDED AS IT IS CURRENTLY -- BUT IT ALSO EITHER OF THESE OP ELIGIBILITY COULD REQUIRE ONE TIME GENERAL FUND SUPPORT JUST -- TO ON A SHORT TERM BASIS TO ALLOW -- THE INCREASED ELIGIBILITY AN INCREASED PARTICIPATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROGRAM TO STABILIZE OVER TIME SO -- WITHOUT A BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH HAVE BEEN JOINED BY CENTER TYLER. QUICK QUESTION -- BUDGET PARTICIPATION YOUR CHART SAYS IS VERY LOW AROUND A THOUSAND PARTICIPANTS IN THE MOST RECENT YEAR. IS THAT BECAUSE WE'VE SO NARROWLY DEFINED WHO QUALIFIES LACK ABOUT REACH WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS YEAH -- THERE'S A COUPLE ISSUES HERE SO DESPITE THE FACT THAT OVER A MILLION CALIFORNIANS QUALIFY FOR THIS PROGRAM I'M HERE -- ONLY A THOUSAND PARTICIPATED IN THE MOST RECENT YEAR ONE ISSUE IS THAT THE PROGRAM HAS ACTUALLY EXISTED SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX I BELIEVE OR NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT SEVENTY SIX BUT IT WAS SUSPENDED IN -- TWO THOUSAND NINE AS A RESULT OF GENERAL FUND BUDGET PRESSURE AND THEN IT WAS REINSTATED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND SO PART OF THE ISSUE THERE MIGHT JUST BE THE FACT THAT THE PROGRAM WAS SUSPENDED AND REINSTATED MEANS THAT AWARENESS IS LOWER THAN IT COULD BE -- BUT ALSO PART OF IT MIGHT BE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO REALLY COULD BENEFIT FROM THE PROGRAM THE MOST DON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACCESS IT. WHAT WHAT WE CONSIDER ALL OF THE MONEY WE SPEND AN OUT REACH FOR EITC THE NEW STATE IN EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT IT SEEMS LIKE THIS WOULD BE? A ANOTHER VIABLE TOOL THAT WE NEED TO PROBABLY DIRECT FROM RESOURCES ONE MORE QUICK QUESTION -- OPEN UP FROM MY COLLEAGUES. THE 40% EQUITY IN THEIR HOMES TO SEE ME HE SAID YOU'RE TRYING TO CALCULATE AND MY 40% EQUITY YET PROBABLY NOT. BUT IF YOU MOVE TO A YOUNGER POPULATION WHAT'S THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO MEET THAT. CRITERIA I'D BE CONCERNED YEAH ABSOLUTELY SO -- ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THAT CRITERIA IS REASONABLE FOR THE CURRENT POPULATION IS THAT THEY'RE OLDER AND SO THEY'VE ON THEIR HOMES FOR A LONGER. YEAH THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE CONSIDERED AN THOUGHT THAT YOU MIGHT NEED TO LOWER THAT THRESHOLD IF -- YOU WANTED TO CHANGE THE AGE ELIGIBILITY THAT WOULD AGAIN INTRODUCED MORE STATE RISK SO THERE'S REALLY JUST A BALANCING ACT THERE BETWEEN -- ENSURING THAT THIS THE PROGRAM HAS ENOUGH FUNDING TO CONTINUE -- AS A RESULT OF ALL THE VARIOUS RISKS THAT IT FACES BUT THEN ALSO ENSURING THAT PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS. EXCELLENT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. SOME TO CABALLERO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I'M I I IN I APOLOGIZE IF THIS ISN'T THE RIGHT JOB HEARING TO HAVE THIS QUESTION BUT I I AM. THAT I WANTED TO ASK -- MR HARDIN ON SB THREE TWENTY NINE NINE YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S YOUR BILL BUT I I WAS VERY -- INTRIGUED BY THE TESTIMONY OF ELDER MCNEIL AS SHE TESTIFIED TO THE SHENANIGANS THAT WERE PLAYED WITH THEIR SECTION. EIGHT AND AND I'M WONDERING. BECAUSE IT IS A FEDERAL PROGRAM WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF AUTHORITY SAY THOU SHALT NOT. BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF WE MAKE -- A IT WE WE USE THE DEFINITION AND UNDER THREE TWENTY NINE BUT SOME OF THAT MAY BE. AT IT UNLAWFUL FOR THEM TO DO. AND THEN WE WOULD WANT TO COME FIGURE OUT A WAY TO CREATE PENALTIES IF PEOPLE PLAY AROUND WITH YEAH I'M GONNA TAKE YOUR SECTION -- EIGHT BUT YOU CAN GET THE PAPER PAPERWORK RIGHT OR YES I'M GONNA TAKE IT BUT NOW I'M I HAVE NOT PAID. THE MORTGAGE AND YOU CAN BE TURNED OUT WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS I MEAN THAT THAT PART OF THE STORY REALLY ANGERED ME AND I I KNOW WE'VE HEARD THOSE KINDS OF STORIES WORKING IN LEGAL AID FOR MANY YEARS. THE QUESTION IS CAN WE PUT TEETH IN SOMETHING. SO IF YOU DO IT. YOU'RE PAYING A BIGGER PENALTY DOWN THE ROAD AND AND THERE ARE THEIR CONSEQUENCE ALMOST WONDERING IF THE IF IF IF IT'S NOT IN THERE IS THERE SOMETHING WE CAN ADD SO THAT WE DON'T NEED TO CHANGE THE FEDERAL. LAW WE JUST ADD OUR OWN PROTECTIONS IN CALIFORNIA. RIGHT WELL I THINK I THINK. THERE THERE'VE BEEN EXPERIENCES WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE IMPLEMENTED THIS PLICY -- AND THEY HAVE FOUND THAT ENFORCEMENT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND NOT OVERLY BURDENSOME THINK. IT DOESN'T TAKE THAT MANY ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS UNDER THIS KIND OF A POLICY TAKE FOR THE MESSAGE TO GET SENT THAT. YOU KNOW LANDLORDS NEED TO TREAT THIS FAMILY IS THE SAME AS AS PEOPLE WHO HAVE ANY OTHER SOURCE OF INCOME -- AND SANTA MONICA HAS HAD A PRETTY SUCCESSFUL EFFORT -- IN PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL LEGAL AID PROGRAMS -- TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT TENANTS ARE SPECTER THAN THAT AND THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY THIS POLICY IS LEADING TO THEM. TRULY BEING ABLE TO ACCESS HOUSING UNITS. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY YOU'VE GIVEN US LOTS OF FOOD FOR THOUGHT WE ALWAYS LIKE TO INCLUDE IN OUR HEARINGS ACTUAL SOLUTION SO WE YOU KNOW DON'T LEAVE HERE. COMPLETELY YOU RIGHT OUT OF OUR MINDS WITH NO. LIGHT IN THE TULSA THANK YOU. VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOU. ARE NOT WE ARE HAPPY TO OPEN THE FLOOR TO PUBLIC COMMENT.
