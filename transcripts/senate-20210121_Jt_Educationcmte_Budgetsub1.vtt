DEPARTMENT. UNDER THE UPDATED

00:26:37.329 --> 00:26:39.097
GUIDANCE DISTRICTS CAN BRING

00:26:39.164 --> 00:26:40.498
BACK ELEMENTARY GRADES AFTER

00:26:40.565 --> 00:26:42.667
CASE RATES FALL BELOW TWENTY

00:26:42.734 --> 00:26:43.835
FIVE PER HUNDRED THOUSAND

PEOPLE THIS THRESHOLD IS STILL

00:26:45.804 --> 00:26:47.505
WITH IN THE PURPLE CARE MEANING

00:26:47.572 --> 00:26:49.174
THAT UNDER THE UPDATED GUIDANCE

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.675
SOME ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS WOULD

00:26:50.742 --> 00:26:52.310
BE ALLOWED TO REOPEN IN PURPLE

00:26:52.377 --> 00:26:54.245
TIER RATHER THAN BRED AS WAS

00:26:54.312 --> 00:26:55.814
PREVIOUSLY THE CASE. ON THE

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:57.482
UPDATED GUIDANCE ALSO HOLDS

00:26:57.549 --> 00:26:59.384
THAT PREVIOUS WAIVER PROCESS

00:26:59.451 --> 00:27:01.152
HOWEVER PREVIOUSLY APPROVED

00:27:01.219 --> 00:27:04.522
WAIVERS REMAIN VALID. WESLEY

00:27:04.589 --> 00:27:05.890
FOR OLDER GRADES NOT LAST ROAD

00:27:05.957 --> 00:27:07.392
AFTER GETTING GUIDANCE ALLOWS

00:27:07.459 --> 00:27:08.660
DISTRICTS TO BRING STUDENTS

00:27:08.727 --> 00:27:09.961
BACK AFTER BEING IN THE RIGHT

00:27:10.028 --> 00:27:11.796
HERE FOR FIVE CONSECUTIVE DAYS

00:27:11.863 --> 00:27:13.631
THE STORE IS THE PERIOD FROM

00:27:13.698 --> 00:27:15.567
FOURTEEN CONSECUTIVE DAYS AS

00:27:15.633 --> 00:27:17.435
WAS PREVIOUSLY THE CASE. SO

00:27:17.502 --> 00:27:19.337
ALONG WITH THE UPDATED GUIDANCE

00:27:19.404 --> 00:27:20.839
THE GOVERNOR ANNOUNCED OTHER

00:27:20.905 --> 00:27:22.841
EFFORTS TO REOPEN SCHOOLS AND

00:27:22.907 --> 00:27:24.009
THESE ARE THE OTHER PILLARS

00:27:24.075 --> 00:27:25.143
THAT MR AND WE MENTIONED

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:31.116
EARLIER SORRY. I'LL JUST MOVE

00:27:31.182 --> 00:27:33.018
PAST THAT. HERE WE KNOW IT'S

00:27:33.084 --> 00:27:34.319
THAT SCHOOLS LEARN HAVE

00:27:34.386 --> 00:27:36.454
DISCRETION OVER WHEN AND HOW TO

00:27:36.521 --> 00:27:38.490
RE OPEN. ALTHOUGH UNDER THE NEW

00:27:38.556 --> 00:27:39.991
STATE GUIDANCE DISTRICTS THAT

00:27:40.058 --> 00:27:41.626
HAVE REOPENED OR PLAN TO REOPEN

00:27:41.693 --> 00:27:44.095
MUST PUBLICLY POST. AND SUBMIT

00:27:44.162 --> 00:27:45.697
SCHOOL REOPENING PLANS TO

COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND-

00:27:47.532 --> 00:27:49.768
VESTI CROSS AGENCY TEAM AND

00:27:49.834 --> 00:27:51.770
THAT IS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S.

00:27:51.836 --> 00:27:53.238
INITIATIVES ON A SCHOOL

00:27:53.304 --> 00:27:55.440
REOPENING- AND THIS TEAM IS

00:27:55.507 --> 00:27:56.908
CONSISTING OF THE CALIFORNIA

00:27:56.975 --> 00:27:58.176
BERMAN PUBLIC HEALTH-

00:27:58.243 --> 00:28:01.012
CALIFORNIA CAL OSHA AND THE AND

00:28:01.079 --> 00:28:03.715
EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. HOWEVER

00:28:03.782 --> 00:28:05.183
IT'S BECAUSE OF THIS LOCAL

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:07.152
DISCRETION OVER WHEN TO RE OPEN

00:28:07.218 --> 00:28:08.086
THAT IN THE FALL WHEN HE

00:28:08.153 --> 00:28:09.421
STREETS FOR LOWER ACROSS THE

00:28:09.487 --> 00:28:11.489
STATE- IN MANY DISTRICTS

00:28:11.556 --> 00:28:13.191
CONSIDERED RE OPENING NEAR THE

00:28:13.258 --> 00:28:14.125
BEGINNING OF THE SCHOOL. SCHOOL

00:28:14.192 --> 00:28:15.794
YEAR THE ULTIMATELY DECIDED TO

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:17.195
CONTINUE WITH DISTANCE LEARNING

00:28:17.262 --> 00:28:18.863
IN ANTICIPATION OF THE HOLIDAY

00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:21.132
SURGE. THIS MEANS HOWEVER THAT

00:28:21.199 --> 00:28:22.567
MOST SCHOOLS HAVE OFFERED ANY

00:28:22.634 --> 00:28:23.635
SIGNIFICANT IN PERSON

00:28:23.701 --> 00:28:25.970
INSTRUCTION SINCE LAST MARCH.

00:28:26.037 --> 00:28:27.338
WE ALSO KNOW THAT SCHOOLS HAVE

00:28:27.405 --> 00:28:29.107
RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT STATE AND

00:28:29.174 --> 00:28:34.345
FEDERAL FUNDING THAT COULD. BE

00:28:34.412 --> 00:28:34.879
USED TO SUPPORT SCHOOL RE

00:28:34.946 --> 00:28:38.950
OPENING. WE ON TO THE NEXT HE.

00:28:39.017 --> 00:28:40.718
OKAY SO HERE WE PROVIDE DETAILS

00:28:40.785 --> 00:28:42.787
OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL I'M

00:28:42.854 --> 00:28:43.388
OUR COLLEAGUES FROM THE

00:28:43.455 --> 00:28:45.123
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:45.990
STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION

00:28:46.057 --> 00:28:46.791
ALREADY DESCRIBED THE

00:28:46.858 --> 00:28:48.660
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IN DETAIL

00:28:48.726 --> 00:28:49.561
I'LL JUST HIGHLIGHT THAT THE

00:28:49.627 --> 00:28:50.962
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DOESN'T

00:28:51.029 --> 00:28:52.430
INCLUDE ENGLISH LEARNERS AND

00:28:52.497 --> 00:28:52.964
THEIR HIGH NEED STUDENTS

00:28:53.031 --> 00:28:55.366
DEFINITION REYES STATE GUIDANCE

00:28:55.433 --> 00:28:56.434
TYPICALLY DOES INCLUDE THIS

00:28:56.501 --> 00:28:58.570
GROUP OF STUDENTS UNDER THE

00:28:58.636 --> 00:29:00.138
HIGH NEEDS CATEGORY. SO WITH

00:29:00.205 --> 00:29:02.474
THAT I THINK I'LL JUST MOVE ON

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:02.874
TO THE ISSUES FOR

00:29:02.941 --> 00:29:05.210
CONSIDERATION. I'M HERE WE

00:29:05.276 --> 00:29:07.879
OFFER- DAY LEGISLATURE JUST

00:29:07.946 --> 00:29:09.314
SOME ISSUES TO CONSIDER

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:10.982
PRIMARILY WE DON'T THINK THE

00:29:11.049 --> 00:29:13.151
PROPOSAL ALLOWS ENOUGH TIME FOR

00:29:13.218 --> 00:29:14.486
DISTRICTS TO COMPLETE THE

00:29:14.552 --> 00:29:16.087
FUNDING REQUIREMENTS. TO MEET

00:29:16.154 --> 00:29:17.555
THE FEBRUARY FIRST DEADLINE

00:29:17.622 --> 00:29:19.057
WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN

00:29:19.124 --> 00:29:21.226
A WEEK FROM TODAY DISTRICTS

00:29:21.292 --> 00:29:22.360
WOULD HAVE VERY LITTLE TIME TO

00:29:22.427 --> 00:29:23.428
UPDATE THEIR SCHOOL WE OPENING

00:29:23.495 --> 00:29:25.130
PLANS ARE RANGE FOR ROUTINE

00:29:25.196 --> 00:29:26.598
TESTING. AND GO SHE WITH THEIR

00:29:26.664 --> 00:29:28.700
LABOR UNIONS THIS MAY BE

00:29:28.766 --> 00:29:30.502
SPECIFICALLY CHALLENGING FOR

00:29:30.568 --> 00:29:32.270
SCHOOLS THAT HAVE BEEN CLOSED

00:29:32.337 --> 00:29:33.004
FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION SINCE

00:29:33.071 --> 00:29:34.906
MARCH. WE'RE ALSO UNCERTAIN

00:29:34.973 --> 00:29:35.974
ABOUT THE CAPACITY OF STATE

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:37.609
AGENCIES AND LOCAL HEALTH

00:29:37.675 --> 00:29:38.543
DEPARTMENTS TO PROVIDE

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:40.478
ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

00:29:40.545 --> 00:29:42.480
FOR SCHOOL OPENING- THAT

00:29:42.547 --> 00:29:43.648
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR EXAMPLE

00:29:43.715 --> 00:29:45.350
DOESN'T PROVIDE AUGMENTATION TO

00:29:45.416 --> 00:29:47.652
THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

00:29:47.719 --> 00:29:49.187
BUDGETS TO SUPPORT THIS

00:29:49.254 --> 00:29:51.356
ADDITIONAL WORK. LASTLY WE

00:29:51.422 --> 00:29:53.158
NOTES THAT AND THAT PROPOSAL AS

00:29:53.224 --> 00:29:54.325
CURRENTLY STRUCTURED IS

00:29:54.392 --> 00:29:56.494
UNLIKELY TO LEAD TO EARLIER IN

00:29:56.561 --> 00:29:58.396
PERSON INSTRUCTION. I THINK

00:29:58.463 --> 00:30:00.131
THERE ARE TWO REASONS FOR THIS

00:30:00.198 --> 00:30:01.499
FIRST TO THE REQUIREMENT FOR

00:30:01.566 --> 00:30:02.934
EAST ROUTINE EXAMS ATIX

00:30:03.001 --> 00:30:06.137
TESTING. AS OFTEN AS EVERY WEEK

00:30:06.204 --> 00:30:07.805
FOR ALL STUDENTS AND STAFF

00:30:07.872 --> 00:30:08.740
NGUYEN TRANSMISSION RATES ARE

00:30:08.806 --> 00:30:11.109
HIGH THIS ADDS MORE COMPLEX

00:30:11.176 --> 00:30:12.944
LOGISTICAL CHALLENGES TO SCHOOL

00:30:13.011 --> 00:30:15.180
RE OPENING WHICH IS ALREADY A

00:30:15.246 --> 00:30:17.282
RATHER LOGISTICALLY CHALLENGING

00:30:17.348 --> 00:30:18.750
ENDEAVOR TO BEGIN WITH. TO BE

00:30:18.816 --> 00:30:20.018
ELIGIBLE FOR FUNDING UNDER THE

00:30:20.084 --> 00:30:21.419
CURRENT PROPOSAL AND DISTRICTS

00:30:21.486 --> 00:30:22.787
WOULD ESSENTIALLY NEED TO RUN

00:30:22.854 --> 00:30:24.689
THEIR OWN TESTING OPERATION WE

00:30:24.756 --> 00:30:26.291
THINK THIS IS LIKELY TO DAMPEN

00:30:26.357 --> 00:30:28.159
OVERALL INTEREST IN SCHOOL

00:30:28.226 --> 00:30:28.726
PARTICIPATION IN THE GRANT

00:30:28.793 --> 00:30:31.563
PROGRAM. SECONDLY KOBE NINETEEN

00:30:31.629 --> 00:30:32.964
CASE RATES ARE RATHER HIGH

00:30:33.031 --> 00:30:34.766
ACROSS THE STATE RIGHT NOW

00:30:34.832 --> 00:30:36.034
GREATER THAN A HUNDRED CASES

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:37.402
PER HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE AS

00:30:37.468 --> 00:30:38.870
OF JANUARY NINETEENTH THIS IS

00:30:38.937 --> 00:30:40.805
ACTUALLY MORE RECENT DATA THAT

00:30:40.872 --> 00:30:42.373
WAS INCLUDED AND HAND OUT. THE

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:43.775
CURRENTLY ONLY SIX COUNTIES

00:30:43.841 --> 00:30:46.611
FALL BELOW THE TWENTY FIVE PER

00:30:46.678 --> 00:30:47.212
HUNDRED THOUSAND THRESHOLD FOR

00:30:47.278 --> 00:30:48.780
SCHOOLS. FOR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

00:30:48.846 --> 00:30:50.114
RE OPENING GIVEN THE

00:30:50.181 --> 00:30:51.649
UNCERTAINTY OVER WHEN CASE

00:30:51.716 --> 00:30:53.017
RATES WILL FALL AND THE

00:30:53.084 --> 00:30:54.485
CORRESPONDING DELAY IN SCHOOL

00:30:54.552 --> 00:30:56.221
REOPENING WE THINK THE PROPOSAL

00:30:56.287 --> 00:31:01.659
MIGHT ACTUALLY MIGHT NOT.

00:31:01.726 --> 00:31:02.260
ACTUALLY RESULTS IN MUCH MORE

00:31:02.327 --> 00:31:05.330
IN PER SINISTRA AND- TURNING TO

00:31:05.396 --> 00:31:08.433
OUR LAST. HERE- WE PROVIDE THE-

00:31:08.499 --> 00:31:09.467
WHEN YOU SEE A FEW OP TO

00:31:09.534 --> 00:31:11.769
CONSIDER MANY OF THESE OPTIONS

00:31:11.836 --> 00:31:13.304
ARE GEARED TOWARDS ADDRESSING

00:31:13.371 --> 00:31:13.738
THE CONCERNS THAT WE

00:31:13.805 --> 00:31:16.207
HIGHLIGHTED EARLIER- FIRST THE

00:31:16.274 --> 00:31:17.575
LEGISLATURE COULD MODIFY THE

00:31:17.642 --> 00:31:19.310
PROPOSAL TO REQUIRE SCHOOLS TO

00:31:19.377 --> 00:31:21.346
OFFER IN PERSON INSTRUCTION ALL

00:31:21.412 --> 00:31:23.314
HIGH NEED STUDENTS A MONTH

00:31:23.381 --> 00:31:24.616
BEFORE THE OTHER ELEMENTARY

00:31:24.682 --> 00:31:26.684
GRADES THIS ALLOWS SCHOOLS UNEF

00:31:26.751 --> 00:31:28.086
TIME TO RAMP UP THEIR TESTING

00:31:28.152 --> 00:31:29.954
CAPACITY AND ADDRESS OTHER

00:31:30.021 --> 00:31:31.656
IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES WITH

00:31:31.723 --> 00:31:32.523
SCHOOL RE OPENING WITH A

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:33.891
SMALLER GROUP OF STAFF AND

00:31:33.958 --> 00:31:35.893
STUDENTS FIRST. WHILE STILL

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:37.562
PROVIDING IN PERSON INSTRUCTION

00:31:37.629 --> 00:31:39.197
TO BENEFITS TO STUDENTS WHO

00:31:39.264 --> 00:31:40.798
WOULD LARGELY BENEFIT FROM IT

00:31:40.865 --> 00:31:42.800
I'M SECONDS THAT LEGISLATURE

00:31:42.867 --> 00:31:43.835
COULD CONSIDER INCLUDING SOME

00:31:43.901 --> 00:31:45.637
FLEXIBILITIES ON A SYMPTOMATIC

00:31:45.703 --> 00:31:47.572
TESTING REQUIREMENTS WE THINK

00:31:47.639 --> 00:31:48.306
THIS IS THE ASPECT OF THE

00:31:48.373 --> 00:31:50.008
PROPOSAL MOST LIKELY TO REDUCE

00:31:50.074 --> 00:31:51.476
SCHOOL PARTICIPATION THE

00:31:51.542 --> 00:31:53.077
LEGISLATURE FOR EXAMPLE COULD

00:31:53.144 --> 00:31:54.979
PROVIDE DISTRICTS AN OPTION TO

00:31:55.046 --> 00:31:56.314
DEVELOP AN ALTERNATIVE TESTING

00:31:56.381 --> 00:31:57.715
KEEP AND WHAT THEIR LABOR

00:31:57.782 --> 00:31:59.951
PARTNERS OR ALLOW DISTRICTS TO

00:32:00.018 --> 00:32:01.786
TEST ALL STAFF WEEKLY BUT A LOT

00:32:01.853 --> 00:32:03.521
OF RANDOM SAMPLING OF STUDENTS

00:32:03.588 --> 00:32:05.323
ON A WEEKLY BASIS. WE THINK

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:07.158
THIS APPROACH- ACKNOWLEDGES

00:32:07.225 --> 00:32:08.326
THAT YOUNGER CHILDREN ARE JUST

00:32:08.393 --> 00:32:09.761
AT LOWER RISK OF TRANSMITTING

00:32:09.827 --> 00:32:11.496
COPING NINETEEN BUT STILL

00:32:11.562 --> 00:32:16.301
ALLOWS FOR ROUTINE. TESTING IN

00:32:16.367 --> 00:32:17.735
A MORE FEASIBLE WAY. WESLEY

00:32:17.802 --> 00:32:19.103
FROM THE FROM. AND THEN

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:19.837
LEGISLATURE LOOK AT WAY TO

00:32:19.904 --> 00:32:22.507
INCREASE. TESTING CAPACITY AND

00:32:22.573 --> 00:32:23.574
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WOULD ALLOW

00:32:23.641 --> 00:32:25.443
SCHOOLS TO MORE EASILY ACCESS

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:27.512
ROUTINE TESTING ALTHOUGH THE

00:32:27.578 --> 00:32:29.113
ADMINISTRATION HAS OFFERED

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:30.481
SCHOOLS ACCESS TO THE STATE

00:32:30.548 --> 00:32:32.483
SUPPORTED VALENCIA BRANCH LAB.

00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:34.385
BASED ON EARLY ESTIMATES THE

00:32:34.452 --> 00:32:36.187
TESTING CAPACITY SET ASIDE FOR

00:32:36.254 --> 00:32:38.589
SCHOOLS. ME ONLY SUPPORT A

00:32:38.656 --> 00:32:40.124
PORTION OF ELEMENTARY STUDENTS

00:32:40.191 --> 00:32:42.093
STATEWIDE. AND WE ALSO KNOW

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:43.628
THAT EXPANDING STATEWIDE

00:32:43.695 --> 00:32:44.762
TESTING CAPACITY AND

00:32:44.829 --> 00:32:45.997
INFRASTRUCTURE WOULD REQUIRE

00:32:46.064 --> 00:32:47.498
NOT PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

00:32:47.565 --> 00:32:48.766
GENERAL FUND. AND WOULD BE

00:32:48.833 --> 00:32:50.034
DIFFICULT TO ACCOMPLISH MY

THEY'RE WORKING FROM THE SAME

00:39:59.196 --> 00:40:01.665
SET OF FACTS ABOUT RISKS AND SO

00:40:01.732 --> 00:40:05.903
FORTH- I THINK THAT. SOMETIMES

00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:07.938
I AM A LITTLE CONCERNED THAT.

00:40:08.005 --> 00:40:09.406

TEACHERS AND STAFF. BUT

00:40:15.379 --> 00:40:17.314
SOMETIMES BY THE SUSSMAN OF

THOSE RISKS- BECAUSE OF LACK OF.

00:40:24.655 --> 00:40:25.623

THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART

00:40:40.971 --> 00:40:42.940
SO. PARENTS NEED TO KNOW SAID

00:40:43.007 --> 00:40:44.275

THEN ALSO THE- THE UNIONS AND

00:40:46.777 --> 00:40:48.045

00:41:05.329 --> 00:41:07.832
FEW WEEKS- I WOULD AGREE WE'VE

00:41:07.898 --> 00:41:09.967

WELL AS- OTHER DOCUMENT THAT

00:41:23.848 --> 00:41:25.216

00:41:37.127 --> 00:41:38.362

COMMUNITIES AND LOCAL

00:41:58.883 --> 00:42:00.651
STAKEHOLDERS SO I THINK WE ARE

00:42:00.718 --> 00:42:01.151
SEEING SOME SUCCESSFUL

00:42:01.218 --> 00:42:02.786
DISSEMINATION. OF THESE

00:42:02.853 --> 00:42:04.622
RESOURCES. ARE BOTH TO THE

00:42:04.688 --> 00:42:06.056
GENERAL PUBLIC AS WELL AS

00:42:06.123 --> 00:42:07.825
RESTORE LABOR PARTNERS. AS WE

00:42:07.892 --> 00:42:09.560
ALL CHEN THIS DISCUSSION TRY TO

00:42:09.627 --> 00:42:10.794
KEEP UP WITH. THE LATEST

00:42:10.861 --> 00:42:12.563
STUDIES AND REYES SEVERANCE.

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:15.566
OKAY SO I GUESS THE DAY I GUESS

00:42:15.633 --> 00:42:17.134
ONE OF THE CONCERNS I HAVE IS

00:42:17.201 --> 00:42:18.802
FOR EXAMPLE I'VE HEARD. AT

00:42:18.869 --> 00:42:20.838
LEAST READ THE NEWS MADE. THAT

00:42:20.905 --> 00:42:22.740
FOR EXAMPLES AND SOME SCHOOL

00:42:22.806 --> 00:42:26.110
DISTRICTS- THERE OF PEOPLE SAID

00:42:26.176 --> 00:42:28.379
THAT UNTIL. ALL THEIR- TEACHERS

00:42:28.445 --> 00:42:35.853
AND STAFF ARE VACCINATED.

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:36.487
THEY'RE NOT GONNA REOPEN. SO IS

00:42:36.553 --> 00:42:38.355
THAT IT MEANS THAT TO BE A LOOK.

00:42:38.422 --> 00:42:40.357
TO THE- IS SO I. I'M TRYING TO

00:42:40.424 --> 00:42:41.425
GET SENSE OF YOU SAID SHARED

00:42:41.492 --> 00:42:43.127
THIS INFORMATION BUT- AT. THAT

00:42:43.193 --> 00:42:44.361
IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:42:44.428 --> 00:42:46.297
PEOPLE ARE ASKING FOR OUR SAY

00:42:46.363 --> 00:42:47.331
THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE THE

00:42:47.398 --> 00:42:49.400
STANDARD- GUIDE. US TO REOPEN

00:42:49.466 --> 00:42:52.269
IT WOULD INDICATE THAT PERHAPS

00:42:52.336 --> 00:42:53.270
THE SHARING HASN'T BEEN ENOUGH.

00:42:53.337 --> 00:42:57.875
IS THAT A CONCERN TO YOU. I

00:42:57.942 --> 00:42:59.877
THINK WE CONTINUE TO SHARE THE

00:42:59.944 --> 00:43:02.179
BEST INFORMATION WE HAVE AND

00:43:02.246 --> 00:43:03.847
YOU KNOW WHETHER IT WE KNOW

00:43:03.914 --> 00:43:05.816
THAT THERE IS- THE A LOT OF

00:43:05.883 --> 00:43:08.886
APPROPRIATE CONCERN- FROM.

00:43:08.953 --> 00:43:12.456
PARENTS FROM STAFF. IN CERTAIN

00:43:12.523 --> 00:43:14.458
HAVING UNCERTAINTY ABOUT SAFETY

00:43:14.525 --> 00:43:15.526
AND SO IT'S BEEN CERTAINLY ONE

00:43:15.592 --> 00:43:16.727
OF THE CORE COMPONENTS SAYS

00:43:16.794 --> 00:43:17.995
WE'VE BEEN ROLLING OUT THESE

00:43:18.062 --> 00:43:19.763
PIECES TO TRY TO PROVIDE. THE

00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:21.065
BEST EVIDENCE TO BUILD THAT

00:43:21.131 --> 00:43:22.866
CONFIDENCE AROUND WHAT IS SAFE

00:43:22.933 --> 00:43:24.234
AND HOW THESE MITIGATION

00:43:24.301 --> 00:43:25.836
MEASURES WOULD PUT TOGETHER A

00:43:25.903 --> 00:43:27.538
PARTICULARLY FOR THE EARLIEST

00:43:27.604 --> 00:43:29.974
GRADES I CAN PROVIDE FOR A SAFE

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:31.408
WORK ENVIRONMENT AND A SAFE

00:43:31.475 --> 00:43:32.843
LEARNING ENVIRONMENT. SO WE

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:34.111
CONTINUE TO DISSEMINATE THAT

00:43:34.178 --> 00:43:36.013
INFORMATION WE TRY TO. STILL

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:37.748
BUILD THAT OUT BUT CERTAINLY WE

00:43:37.815 --> 00:43:39.917
KNOW THAT- THAT CONTINUES TO BE

00:43:39.984 --> 00:43:41.352
AN AREA THAT WILL NEED MORE

00:43:41.418 --> 00:43:45.789
TIME TO FOCUS. OKAY WELL I

00:43:45.856 --> 00:43:47.858
THINK THAT- THAT YEAH I JUST

00:43:47.925 --> 00:43:49.994
WANNA MAKE THE- THEN WE'RE

00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:51.362
GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE SOME OF

00:43:51.428 --> 00:43:53.564
THESE THINGS OUT AND- I

00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:55.766
APPRECIATE. SHARING PROVIDES

00:43:55.833 --> 00:43:57.835
SOME PLAYS SOME POINT. WE'VE

00:43:57.901 --> 00:43:59.937
GOTTA DO SOME PERSUASION TO

00:44:00.004 --> 00:44:02.539
AND- IT IT AND WHETHER THAT

00:44:02.606 --> 00:44:05.876
MEANS MORE TIME MORE EDUCATION-

00:44:05.943 --> 00:44:07.011
IT'S ADDRESS AND IT'S A BIG

00:44:07.077 --> 00:44:08.979
STATES SO I JUST I ALSO WONDER

00:44:09.046 --> 00:44:10.981
ABOUT CAPACITY TO. BECAUSE WE

00:44:11.048 --> 00:44:14.451
CAN PUT SOMETHING ON A WEBSITE

00:44:14.518 --> 00:44:15.019
SAID WE'VE NOW SHARED IT TO

00:44:15.085 --> 00:44:16.020
EVERYBODY BUT- I DON'T KNOW

00:44:16.086 --> 00:44:17.621
THEY'VE READ IT HOW CONVINCING

00:44:17.688 --> 00:44:19.256
THAT IS. OPPORTUNITY TO

00:44:19.323 --> 00:44:20.791
ACTUALLY ENGAGE PEOPLE ON MORE

00:44:20.858 --> 00:44:23.360
ON ONE ON ONE- TO BE ABLE TO

00:44:23.427 --> 00:44:23.894
HAVE THOSE TYPES OF

00:44:23.961 --> 00:44:25.863
CONVERSATIONS. SO THAT WE CAN

00:44:25.929 --> 00:44:27.731
ACTUALLY SO THAT PEOPLE CAN

00:44:27.798 --> 00:44:30.701
COME TO AGREEMENT IN THE ONE

00:44:30.768 --> 00:44:31.268
THOUSAND THIRTY SEVEN SCHOOL

00:44:31.335 --> 00:44:33.771
DISTRICTS WE HAVE- TO SAY OKAY

00:44:33.837 --> 00:44:35.539
WE'RE ALL THAT COMFORTABLE TO

00:44:35.606 --> 00:44:37.341
REOPEN AND BY THE WAY I ALSO.

00:44:37.408 --> 00:44:38.976
MENTION THE PARENTS TO THAT

00:44:39.043 --> 00:44:39.576
THEY HAVE TO FEEL COMFORTABLE

00:44:39.643 --> 00:44:41.412
TO SEND THEIR KIDS. AS WELL AS

00:44:41.478 --> 00:44:43.680

EDUCATION TO DO THAT LEVEL OF

00:45:01.732 --> 00:45:04.068

REVISION AND REINCORPORATED

EXPANDED AND RE ALLOCATE THEM

00:48:16.093 --> 00:48:18.128
QUICKLY. AND THAT MEANS THAT

00:48:18.195 --> 00:48:19.763
THEY WOULD BE UNUSED BUT IT

00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:20.831
WOULD COME IN THE MAY REVISION

00:48:20.897 --> 00:48:22.399
AND REQUIRE LEGISLATIVE

00:48:22.466 --> 00:48:28.538

THE SOMETHING IN POWER. WERE WE

00:48:35.212 --> 00:48:36.546
CAN FIGURE OUT WHO IS GOING TO

00:48:36.613 --> 00:48:40.117

UNDERSTAND IF I'M GETTING A

FAIR READ- BECAUSE I'M ONLY

00:48:47.157 --> 00:48:48.458
HEARING FROM THOSE THAT ARE NOT

00:48:48.525 --> 00:48:53.397
COMPLYING AND IT'S A LONG LIST.

00:48:53.463 --> 00:48:54.665
CERTAINLY SO NO THERE IS NO

00:48:54.731 --> 00:48:56.400
PUBLIC LIST AND WHERE WE ARE

00:48:56.466 --> 00:48:57.934
KEEPING TRACK OF WHO IS OR WHO

00:48:58.001 --> 00:49:00.203
ISN'T APPLYING BUT- IN TERMS

00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:01.204
THAT WE CAN WORK WITH YOUR

STAFF TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN GET

00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:04.841
YOU CONNECTED UP WITH FOLKS WHO

00:49:04.908 --> 00:49:06.443
ARE INTERESTED IN APPLYING FOR

00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:08.445
THE PROGRAM SEVENTY COULD IT IN

00:49:08.512 --> 00:49:11.348
ANOTHER QUESTION. I DID ASSUME

00:49:11.415 --> 00:49:15.652
WITH TWENTY- PRESIDENTS OF

00:49:15.719 --> 00:49:18.055
LABOR ORGANIZATIONS TEACHERS

00:49:18.121 --> 00:49:19.756
UNIONS IN THE NORTHERN HALF OF

00:49:19.823 --> 00:49:22.492
MY DISTRICT. AND THERE WASN'T A

00:49:22.559 --> 00:49:23.427
ONE THAT THOUGHT THEY COULD

00:49:23.493 --> 00:49:24.628
COMPLETE THE COLLECTIVE

00:49:24.695 --> 00:49:26.863
BARGAINING OF THAT WOULD BE

00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:30.400
REQUIRED IN TIME. FOR THIS

00:49:30.467 --> 00:49:33.470
APPLICATION PROCESS EVEN IF THE

00:49:33.537 --> 00:49:36.106
DISTRICT WANTED TO APPLY. IS

00:49:36.173 --> 00:49:37.741
DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO

00:49:37.808 --> 00:49:42.713
REFLECT ON THAT ARE THEY WRONG.

00:49:42.779 --> 00:49:44.281
WHICH IS THE THIRD CERTAINLY WE

00:49:44.348 --> 00:49:46.883
HAVE- WE HAVE RECEIVED. SIMILAR

00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:47.984
FEEDBACK THAT THERE ARE

00:49:48.051 --> 00:49:49.920
CONCERNS ABOUT THE ABILITY OF

00:49:49.986 --> 00:49:51.054
SPOKE TO MEET THE COLLECTIVE

00:49:51.121 --> 00:49:51.955
BARGAINING AGREEMENT

00:49:52.022 --> 00:49:54.391
REQUIREMENTS I THINK- IT'S A

00:49:54.458 --> 00:49:55.092
LITTLE IT'S A LITTLE MORE

00:49:55.158 --> 00:49:56.827
COMPLICATED JUST BECAUSE THERE

00:49:56.893 --> 00:49:58.829
ARE ONLY EIGHT OUT THERE WHO

00:49:58.895 --> 00:49:59.830
CURRENTLY HAVE COLLECTIVE

00:49:59.896 --> 00:50:02.265
BARGAINING AGREEMENTS- THAT DO

00:50:02.332 --> 00:50:03.800
ALIGN WITH THEIR SCHOOL SAFETY

00:50:03.867 --> 00:50:05.702
PLANS- AND WOULD BE ELIGIBLE

00:50:05.769 --> 00:50:07.237
WITHOUT NEEDING TO RENEGOTIATE

00:50:07.304 --> 00:50:08.638
CLAPS THAT'S ONE I THINK

00:50:08.705 --> 00:50:10.307
IMPORTANT THING. TO KEEP IN

00:50:10.374 --> 00:50:12.676
MIND ARE THEY- ARE THEY IN

00:50:12.743 --> 00:50:16.313
GENERAL ARE ONES THAT HAVE A

00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:18.448
HYBRID. A PROBE IF DOCTOR WITH

00:50:18.515 --> 00:50:22.786
PARTIALLY REOPENED SCHOOLS. SH

00:50:22.853 --> 00:50:26.656
IT IS NOT SUPER CONSISTENT- BUT

00:50:26.723 --> 00:50:28.625
YES MANY OF THEM ARE HYBRID

00:50:28.692 --> 00:50:31.294
MODELS WHICH ARE AND WITHIN THE

00:50:31.361 --> 00:50:33.563
DEFINITION OF OPEN AND FOR THE

00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:35.132
PURPOSES OF THE GRANT.

00:50:35.198 --> 00:50:36.333
CONSISTENCY THERE I THINK

00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:38.135
THERE'S A CONCERN THAT'S BEEN

00:50:38.201 --> 00:50:38.769
EXPRESSED IN PEOPLE THAT HAVE

00:50:38.835 --> 00:50:40.937
TALKED TO ME. THAT THE HYBRID

00:50:41.004 --> 00:50:43.540
SCHOOLS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY

00:50:43.607 --> 00:50:45.375
IN MORE AFFLUENT DISTRICTS AND

00:50:45.442 --> 00:50:47.144
THEREFORE IF THEY'RE THE ONES

00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:48.512
THAT HAVE THE EXISTING SAVINGS

00:50:48.578 --> 00:50:50.647
A SAFETY PLANS AND COLLECTIVE

00:50:50.714 --> 00:50:52.282
BARGAINING AGREEMENTS THEY HAVE

00:50:52.349 --> 00:50:54.184
A LEG UP IN THISPROCESS BEFORE

00:50:54.251 --> 00:50:55.719
YOU GET TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS

00:50:55.786 --> 00:50:56.153
THAT MIGHT BE MORE

00:50:56.219 --> 00:50:59.956
DISADVANTAGED. SO THAT IS A

00:51:00.023 --> 00:51:01.191
CONCERN THAT HAS BEEN EXPRESSED.

00:51:01.258 --> 00:51:03.326
BERMAN BE JUST ONE MORE BECAUSE

00:51:03.393 --> 00:51:04.761
I KNOW THAT WILL HAVE A LOT OF

00:51:04.828 --> 00:51:07.063
QUESTIONS. COMING OUT OF THE

00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:09.199
PANEL. THAT RUN SOME OF THE

00:51:09.266 --> 00:51:11.535
SUBJECTS AND LET ME JUST ASK IT

00:51:11.601 --> 00:51:12.135
AGAIN I THINK I KNOW WHAT THE

00:51:12.202 --> 00:51:14.037
ANSWER IS. BUT WHEN YOU

00:51:14.104 --> 00:51:16.339
PREPARED THIS PROPOSAL WHEN

00:51:16.406 --> 00:51:17.207
THERE WAS THE MONEY FOR THE

00:51:17.274 --> 00:51:19.075
SUPPORTS AND THERE WAS THE

00:51:19.142 --> 00:51:22.245
MONEY THE TWO BILLION FOR RE-OPENING AND IT'S ROUGH IF I

00:51:22.312 --> 00:51:23.880
REMEMBER RIGHT AT SIX POINT SIX

00:51:23.947 --> 00:51:25.916
BILLION TOTAL. AND THEN A

00:51:25.982 --> 00:51:27.818
COUPLE OF DAYS LATER HERE COMES

00:51:27.884 --> 00:51:29.619
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS SIX

00:51:29.686 --> 00:51:31.855
POINT SEVEN BILLION. AND I GOT

00:51:31.922 --> 00:51:32.889
THE IMPRESSION THAT YOU THINK

00:51:32.956 --> 00:51:35.325
NOT A DOLLAR. FROM THE FEDERAL

00:51:35.392 --> 00:51:36.993
MONEY WOULD DISPLACE ANYTHING

00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:38.395
THAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR AND

00:51:38.462 --> 00:51:41.965
STATE MONEY FOR SCHOOL SCHOOL

00:51:42.032 --> 00:51:43.700
RE OPENING IS THAT CORRECT. SH

00:51:43.767 --> 00:51:45.168
SAID WE SEE OUR PROPOSAL AS

00:51:45.235 --> 00:51:47.604
BEING- COMPLEMENTARY TO THE

00:51:47.671 --> 00:51:49.673
FEDERAL FUNDS. L. AS AS I'M

00:51:49.739 --> 00:51:51.007
SURE YOU KNOW ON THE FEDERAL

00:51:51.074 --> 00:51:52.876
FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED BASED ON

00:51:52.943 --> 00:51:54.511
TITLE ONE NUMBER TITLE ONE

00:51:54.578 --> 00:51:56.713
STUDENTS BETTER BEING SERVED BY

00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:59.883
ELEAZAR. OUR PROPOSAL ALLOCATE

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:02.185
FUNDS BASED ON TOTAL SELF

00:52:02.252 --> 00:52:03.987
INTERFACE GRANT CENTURY I'M

00:52:04.054 --> 00:52:05.522
THAT ADJUSTED FOR LTSS OF METAL

00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:08.358
CONCENTRATION GRANT FACTORS- SO

00:52:08.425 --> 00:52:09.459
WE WOULD GET OUR OUR GRANT

00:52:09.526 --> 00:52:11.228
ENSURES THAT MORE LEDS ARE

00:52:11.294 --> 00:52:12.863
ELIGIBLE FOR FUNDING ON A

00:52:12.929 --> 00:52:14.498
GREATER AMOUNT OF FUNDING-

00:52:14.564 --> 00:52:16.633
WHERE AS THE TITLE ONE FUNDS.

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:18.301
AT THE FEDERAL AFTER FUND AND

00:52:18.368 --> 00:52:20.637
ALLOCATE ON TITLE ONE- ARE A

00:52:20.704 --> 00:52:22.539
LITTLE MORE TARGETED AND TO

00:52:22.606 --> 00:52:24.074
LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES AND SO

00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:25.575
I THINK WHEN YOU PUT THE TWO

00:52:25.642 --> 00:52:27.110
PIECES TOGETHER YOU'RE ENSURING

00:52:27.177 --> 00:52:28.845
THAT NOT ONLY IS THERE A STRONG

00:52:28.912 --> 00:52:30.247
EQUITY COMPONENT IN ENSURING

00:52:30.313 --> 00:52:31.982
THAT THE LOWEST INCOME. AREAS

00:52:32.048 --> 00:52:33.617
YOU'RE GETTING THE MOST FUNDING

00:52:33.683 --> 00:52:34.851
BUT ALSO THAT EVERYONE IS

00:52:34.918 --> 00:52:36.186
GETTING ACCESS TO FUNDS TO

00:52:36.253 --> 00:52:38.154
ADDRESS THE NEEDS FOR THE COST

00:52:38.221 --> 00:52:40.223
OF IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. THREE

00:52:40.290 --> 00:52:41.658
ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS

00:52:41.725 --> 00:52:42.592
THAT HAPPENED LATER IN THE

00:52:42.659 --> 00:52:48.498
BUDGET A COUPLE. A. WAYS INTO

00:52:48.565 --> 00:52:49.699
SENATOR MAN. S. ABOUT HIGH

00:52:49.766 --> 00:52:51.101
RIDGE. FOR AND THE FOR THAT THE

00:52:51.167 --> 00:52:52.869
PROPOSAL IN THE BUDGET DOESN'T

00:52:52.936 --> 00:52:54.437
BRING IT BACK TO WHERE IT WAS

00:52:54.504 --> 00:52:57.007
PRETTY PANDEMIC. AND THE ANSWER

00:52:57.073 --> 00:52:58.808
WAS. WHAT THEY'RE GETTING

00:52:58.875 --> 00:53:01.044
FEDERAL FUNDS TO THE FEDERAL

00:53:01.111 --> 00:53:02.913
FUNDS WILL BRING THEM HIGHER.

00:53:02.979 --> 00:53:05.582
AND IS THAT A DIFFERENT CASE

00:53:05.649 --> 00:53:07.584
WHERE WHAT COUNTING THE FEDERAL

00:53:07.651 --> 00:53:08.985
FUNDS TO HELP PEOPLE IN HIGHER

00:53:09.052 --> 00:53:11.788
EDUCATION BUT NOT IN K. THROUGH

00:53:11.855 --> 00:53:13.590
TWELVE BECAUSE- IT'S TIED ONE

00:53:13.657 --> 00:53:14.891
IN K. THROUGH TWELVE AND

00:53:14.958 --> 00:53:16.393
THEREFORE. IT'S A DIFFERENT

00:53:16.459 --> 00:53:17.861
BROUGH BURKE BECAUSE IT SEEMS

00:53:17.928 --> 00:53:19.229
TO ME THE PRINCIPLES THE SAME

00:53:19.296 --> 00:53:22.299
IT'S JUST THE OPERATION IS

00:53:22.365 --> 00:53:24.534
DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE TWO. NO I

00:53:24.601 --> 00:53:27.070
DON'T THINK THAT THAT WAS OUR-

00:53:27.137 --> 00:53:27.671
THAT WAS NOT OUR THOUGHT

00:53:27.737 --> 00:53:29.239
PROCESS AND IN TERMS OF

00:53:29.306 --> 00:53:30.574
COMPARING THE TWO BECAUSE IN

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:33.476
IN. IN PRACTICAL SENSE AND

00:53:33.543 --> 00:53:34.144
WE'RE NOT HAVING THE SAME

00:53:34.210 --> 00:53:35.145
EXPECTATIONS OF HIGHER

00:53:35.211 --> 00:53:37.414
EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS OF THE

00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:40.283
ARCADE TWELVE. LOOK SCHOOLS WE

00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:42.118
KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR K.

00:53:42.185 --> 00:53:43.520
TWELVE STUDENTS TO BE BACK IN

00:53:43.587 --> 00:53:44.621
SCHOOL AND IN PERSON

00:53:44.688 --> 00:53:45.922
INSTRUCTION AND THAT THEY HAVE

00:53:45.989 --> 00:53:48.458
UNIQUE AND SIGNIFICANT NEED-

00:53:48.525 --> 00:53:49.759
BEYOND OBVIOUSLY OUR HIGHER

00:53:49.826 --> 00:53:51.561
EDUCATION TUDENT HAVING IT AS

00:53:51.628 --> 00:53:53.229
WELL BUT I THINK THAT THEY NEED

00:53:53.296 --> 00:53:54.431
TO K. TWELVE STUDENTS ARE MUCH

00:53:54.497 --> 00:53:56.633
MORE SIGNIFICANT SO IN OUR MIND

00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:57.701
FOR K. TWELVE IT'S NOT ABOUT

00:53:57.767 --> 00:53:59.469
GETTING BACK. TO WHERE WE WERE

00:53:59.536 --> 00:54:00.904
IT'S ABOUT ENSURING THAT THERE

00:54:00.971 --> 00:54:02.539
ARE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO

00:54:02.606 --> 00:54:03.873
SERVE THESE KIDS AN IN PERSON

00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:05.642

THE TAKE UP RATE IS GOING TO BE

00:55:43.573 --> 00:55:44.607
WITHIN THE GRANT I THINK IT'S

THAT WAS RELEASED. AND

00:56:32.122 --> 00:56:33.189
OBVIOUSLY THAT WAS VERY

00:56:33.256 --> 00:56:34.991
DIFFICULT GIVEN THE FACT THAT

00:56:35.058 --> 00:56:37.494
MANY ELEAZAR- HAD INVESTED IN

00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:41.364
DIFFERENT PRIORITIES- PRIOR TO-

00:56:41.431 --> 00:56:42.832
COMING TO THIS POINT PRIOR TO

00:56:42.899 --> 00:56:44.334
THE CHANGES IN THE HEALTH AND

00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:46.636
SAFETY GUIDANCE SO- MAKING SOME

00:56:46.703 --> 00:56:47.771
KIND OF RUSSIA'S FUNCTIONS

00:56:47.837 --> 00:56:49.239
ABOUT THE COST AND THEN ALSO

00:56:49.305 --> 00:56:50.573
MAKING SOME ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT

00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:52.575
THE FACT. THAT THE FUNDING THAT

00:56:52.642 --> 00:56:55.078
WE'RE PROVIDING IS GENERATED ON

00:56:55.145 --> 00:57:02.819
A TOTAL PER PUPIL- EIGHTY EIGHT

00:57:02.886 --> 00:57:05.755
BASIS. TELL HER A FOR ALL.

00:57:05.822 --> 00:57:07.557
STUDENTS AND A LOOK LIKE YOU. A

00:57:07.624 --> 00:57:09.025
WITH EXCEPTION OF STUDENTS.

00:57:09.092 --> 00:57:10.894
STUDY BUT WOULD ONLY BE USED.

00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:11.861
FOR STUDENTS AND STAFF WHO ARE

00:57:11.928 --> 00:57:13.363
PROVIDE INCREASED INSTRUCTION

00:57:13.429 --> 00:57:15.131
KNOWING THAT. THE GENERATION OF

00:57:15.198 --> 00:57:17.734
THE FUNDS- THE ACTUAL IMPACT

00:57:17.801 --> 00:57:19.903
PER PUPIL OUR STUDENTS WHO ARE

00:57:19.969 --> 00:57:21.171
IN PERSON INSTRUCTION WOULD BE

00:57:21.237 --> 00:57:23.573
HIGHER. THAN THE PER PUPIL

00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:24.908
AMOUNT PROVIDED AND THEN ALSO

00:57:24.974 --> 00:57:26.376
RECOGNIZING THAT WE ARE WAITING

00:57:26.442 --> 00:57:28.912
IT YOU KNOW SIMILAR TO LCS

00:57:28.978 --> 00:57:31.181
FASTER AND DUPLICATED STUDENT-

00:57:31.247 --> 00:57:35.084
THAT THAT WOULD BE. IN PERFECT-

00:57:35.151 --> 00:57:36.452
YOU KNOW HIGHLY ASSUMPTION

00:57:36.519 --> 00:57:38.254
BASED. ON METHODOLOGY THAT WE

00:57:38.321 --> 00:57:38.988
USED IN COMING UP WITH THOSE

00:57:39.055 --> 00:57:41.257
NUMBERS- AND THE TWO BILLION

00:57:41.324 --> 00:57:43.059
AND THEN ALSO YOU KNOW WE BUILT

00:57:43.126 --> 00:57:44.494
THIS WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT

00:57:44.561 --> 00:57:44.994
FEDERAL FUNDS WOULD BE

00:57:45.061 --> 00:57:47.997
AVAILABLE BUT- YOU KNOW WE HAD-

00:57:48.064 --> 00:57:49.232
SOME INDICATION THAT THERE

00:57:49.299 --> 00:57:50.400
THERE COULD BE ADDITIONAL

00:57:50.466 --> 00:57:52.302
FEDERAL RESOURCES. SO I'M

00:57:52.368 --> 00:57:53.436
TRYING TO KEEP THAT IN MIND AS

00:57:53.503 --> 00:57:54.938
WELL AS THE BRICK BUILDING NEXT

00:57:55.004 --> 00:57:57.373
TO ENSURE THAT WE WEREN'T- YOU

00:57:57.440 --> 00:57:59.075
KNOW NOT NOT TAKING INTO

00:57:59.142 --> 00:58:00.143
ACCOUNT THE FACT THAT THERE

00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:04.647
WOULD BE. ADDITIONAL RESOURCES.

00:58:04.714 --> 00:58:06.115
IN APRIL A DEEP DIVE I THINK

00:58:06.182 --> 00:58:07.250
THAT THE CONCERN IS IN WOULD

00:58:07.317 --> 00:58:08.051
LIKE BE TO GET YOU TAKE ON THE

AS WE HAVE MOVED FORWARD- AND-

00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:11.654
SEEN THE CHALLENGES THAT

00:58:11.721 --> 00:58:13.022
DISTRICTS FACING NINETY WANT TO

00:58:13.089 --> 00:58:15.225
USE AN EXAMPLE. SO IF WE'RE TO

00:58:15.291 --> 00:58:16.492
LOOK AT WHAT THE STATE IS

00:58:16.559 --> 00:58:18.161
PAYING POTENTIALLY FOR TESTING

00:58:18.228 --> 00:58:19.929
IS THIRTY EIGHT DOLLARS TO

00:58:19.996 --> 00:58:21.297
FIFTY BUCKS FOR TEST. IN FOR

00:58:21.364 --> 00:58:22.765
PROVIDING A SMALL DISTRICT

00:58:22.832 --> 00:58:24.467
WHICH IS SAY IT'S A THOUSAND

00:58:24.534 --> 00:58:26.870

00:58:26.936 --> 00:58:28.872
FIFTY JUST ON TESTING AND ON

00:58:28.938 --> 00:58:31.374
THE REGIMENT THAT IS- IN THE RE

OPENING PLAN- IT IS GOING TO

00:58:33.943 --> 00:58:35.578
EAT UP THAT FOR FIFTY JUST ON

00:58:35.645 --> 00:58:39.048
TESTING. SO IT HAS THERE BEEN

00:58:39.115 --> 00:58:41.217
SOME ADDITIONAL ASSESSMENT ON-

00:58:41.284 --> 00:58:42.318
FIVE ADDITIONAL DOLLARS ARE

00:58:42.385 --> 00:58:43.720

THAT ONE EXAMPLE. ON TESTING

00:58:47.857 --> 00:58:49.192
BECAUSE THE CHEAPEST AND ALL

00:58:49.259 --> 00:58:50.226
THAT I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE

00:58:50.293 --> 00:58:51.561

TESTING. AND THE ONE OTHER

01:01:15.571 --> 01:01:17.373
THING THAT I WOULD MENTION- IS

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:20.276

THAT IS THAT SIMILAR TO AS

01:02:02.351 --> 01:02:05.721
OUTLINED IN OUR GUIDANCE- IN

01:02:05.788 --> 01:02:06.722

YOU'RE SPOT ON WITH YOUR THIRTY

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:11.394
EIGHT FIFTY DOLLARS THAT IS

01:02:11.461 --> 01:02:12.662
THAT IS WHAT I UNDERSTAND TO BE

01:02:12.728 --> 01:02:14.530
THAT THE RATE FOR TESTING BUT-

01:02:14.597 --> 01:02:16.332
WE ARE ALSO LOOKING AT THINGS

01:02:16.399 --> 01:02:19.268
LIKE. FOOLING TESTING- TO TRY

01:02:19.335 --> 01:02:21.237
TO BRING DOWN THE COST YEAH

01:02:21.304 --> 01:02:23.706
EVEN MORE SO- SO WE ARE WE ARE

01:02:23.773 --> 01:02:26.275

THAT CASTING CAN BE- DONE AS AS

01:02:29.445 --> 01:02:31.047
EASILY AND AS INEXPENSIVELY AS

01:02:31.114 --> 01:02:33.049
POSSIBLE I'M ONE OF THE OTHER

01:02:33.116 --> 01:02:33.683
THINGS THAT FOLKS HAVE

01:02:33.749 --> 01:02:35.518
APPROACHED ME ABOUT IS THE COST

01:02:35.585 --> 01:02:37.887
OF INFRASTRUCTURE. RELATED TO

ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE

01:02:42.658 --> 01:02:44.794
LOOKING INTO IS THE POSSIBILITY

01:02:44.861 --> 01:02:45.928
THAT TEST TEST CAN BE TAKEN

01:02:45.995 --> 01:02:48.764

HOME AND THEN BROUGHT BACK SO.

01:02:50.233 --> 01:02:51.934
WE ARE WORKING VERY HARD TO

01:02:52.001 --> 01:02:54.003
ENSURE THAT THE TESTING

01:02:54.070 --> 01:02:54.904
COMPONENT IS NOT THE BIGGEST

01:02:54.971 --> 01:02:56.506
BARRIER IN ALL OF THIS AND THAT

01:02:56.572 --> 01:02:58.207
IT MADE AS- AN EXTENSION AND

01:02:58.274 --> 01:02:59.942
EXPANSION OF POSSIBLE FOR

01:03:00.009 --> 01:03:02.111
SCHOOL AND- TEN MANAGER ONNA

01:03:02.178 --> 01:03:04.614

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:07.049
CONCERN AT THIS POINT IS WILL

01:03:07.116 --> 01:03:09.318
MEDICARE NOW. THAT BILLION

BY FEBRUARY FIRST SO- IT'S NOT

01:03:14.524 --> 01:03:17.660
I TRIED TO TRUST BUT VERIFY BY

01:03:17.727 --> 01:03:18.427
THE DISTRICTS ARE GOING TO

01:03:18.494 --> 01:03:20.163
TRUST US TO BE ABLE TO GET IT

01:03:20.229 --> 01:03:23.065
DONE IN THE SECOND PIECE IS- IF

01:03:23.132 --> 01:03:24.800
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. PULLING

01:03:24.867 --> 01:03:26.903
TESTING I JUST DON'T HAVE A

01:03:26.969 --> 01:03:28.237
FALSE START I DON'T THINK ANY

01:03:28.304 --> 01:03:29.105
OF US WANT TO HAVE A FALSE

01:03:29.172 --> 01:03:30.339
START WE DON'T WANT TO OVER

01:03:30.406 --> 01:03:32.675
PROMISE AND UNDER DELIVER END

01:03:32.742 --> 01:03:34.343
ACROSS THIS NATION WE SEE THAT

01:03:34.410 --> 01:03:36.646
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AND-

01:03:36.712 --> 01:03:38.414
TERRENCE THE LAST THING THEY

01:03:38.481 --> 01:03:41.083
NEED IS A FALSE START. SO MANY

01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:41.717
PARENTS WANT TO GET THEIR KIDS

01:03:41.784 --> 01:03:43.586

HAVE TESTING UP AND RUNNING AS

01:03:49.125 --> 01:03:51.093
IS REQUIRED THEN I'M DEEPLY

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:52.728
CONCERNED THAT IT WILL BE A

01:03:52.795 --> 01:03:55.231
FALSE START AND I JUST WANTED

01:03:55.298 --> 01:03:55.998
TO PUT THAT OUT THERE AND I

01:03:56.065 --> 01:03:57.200
KNOW THAT CAN YEAH DISCUSSIONS

01:03:57.266 --> 01:03:58.935
ARE GONNA CONTINUE. MANAGER

01:03:59.001 --> 01:04:01.304
VERY QUICKLY- ON THE

01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:09.045
REQUIREMENTS IN REGARDS TO- IN-

01:04:09.111 --> 01:04:11.113
REAL OPENING PLAN WHEN IT. TO

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:13.549
IN TO CONNECT. SO I. IS

01:04:13.616 --> 01:04:14.116
DISTRICTS ARE GONNA HAVE TO

01:04:14.183 --> 01:04:16.419
SEARCH THAT EACH OF THIS. IT'S

01:04:16.485 --> 01:04:17.019
BEEN A DISTANCE LEARNING HAVE

01:04:17.086 --> 01:04:18.120
TO CONVENE A COMPUTING DEVICE

01:04:18.187 --> 01:04:19.388
SOFTWARE AND HIGH SPEED

01:04:19.455 --> 01:04:20.223
INTERNET THAT'S NOT HAPPENING

01:04:20.289 --> 01:04:23.459
NOW. SO IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT

01:04:23.526 --> 01:04:25.928
RURAL CALIFORNIA AND ESPECIALLY

01:04:25.995 --> 01:04:27.897
HELLO EASE HUMBLED DOWN OR

01:04:27.964 --> 01:04:30.099
COUNTY TRINITY COUNTY. STUDENTS

01:04:30.166 --> 01:04:31.200
DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH SPEED

01:04:31.267 --> 01:04:33.102
INTERNET IN FACT THE FIRST OF

01:04:33.169 --> 01:04:35.304
ITS KIND PLAN WITH A SATELLITE

01:04:35.371 --> 01:04:37.807
PROVIDER- WE ARE ONLY ABLE TO

01:04:37.873 --> 01:04:39.542
SIGN UP HUNDRED ADDITIONAL

01:04:39.609 --> 01:04:40.776
STUDENTS BECAUSE OF THE PRICE

01:04:40.843 --> 01:04:42.378
TAG. SO IF THERE'S A

01:04:42.445 --> 01:04:43.913
REQUIREMENT THAT DISTRICTS ARE

01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:46.148
GONNA TO CERTIFY THAT STUDENTS

01:04:46.215 --> 01:04:47.183
HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH SPEED

01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:49.785
INTERNET THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO

01:04:49.852 --> 01:04:53.356
BE ABLE TO CERTIFY. YES I AM

01:04:53.422 --> 01:04:54.290
I'M NOT SURE IF THAT QUESTION

01:04:54.357 --> 01:04:55.424
WAS DIRECTED AT ME BUT I'M

01:04:55.491 --> 01:04:56.459
GONNA GO AHEAD AND YOU KNOW I

01:04:56.525 --> 01:04:57.660
MEAN IT'S A IT'S A COMMON IN

01:04:57.727 --> 01:04:59.095
ITS THE TRUTH I MEAN FOR RURAL

01:04:59.161 --> 01:05:01.163
CALIFORNIA WE HAVE DISTRICTS

01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:02.331
THAT ARE STILL DOING. PACKET

01:05:02.398 --> 01:05:04.000
PICK UPS BECAUSE STUDENTS DON'T

01:05:04.066 --> 01:05:06.002
HAVE ACCESS. YOU CAN'T GET A

01:05:06.068 --> 01:05:08.871
HOT SPOT. YOU CAN'T GET A

01:05:08.938 --> 01:05:10.973
SIGNAL FOR WIFI IN YOUR HOME.

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:12.975
IN MOST ARE LOW INCOME SO I

01:05:13.042 --> 01:05:14.710
JUST THAT REQUIREMENT IN THERE

01:05:14.777 --> 01:05:16.345
THAT DISTRICTS GRANT TO CERTIFY

01:05:16.412 --> 01:05:17.780
INTO THIS DEPENDENT ON THAT

01:05:17.847 --> 01:05:19.348
CERTIFICATION DEPENDING ON RE

01:05:19.415 --> 01:05:20.416
OPENING THIS IS MORE OF A

01:05:20.483 --> 01:05:24.186
COMMENT- THEY'RE JUST NEVER

01:05:24.253 --> 01:05:25.655
GOING TO BE A MEET THAT HURDLE.

01:05:25.721 --> 01:05:26.789
SO I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE

01:05:26.856 --> 01:05:29.091
SOME AYE I'M- THOUGHT OF A ONE

01:05:29.158 --> 01:05:31.260
SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH- I THINK

01:05:31.327 --> 01:05:32.495
EVERY DISTRICT HAS BEEN TRYING

01:05:32.561 --> 01:05:33.362
LIKE HELL TO BE ABLE TO GET

01:05:33.429 --> 01:05:35.264
THERE. IT'S JUST AT NO FAULT OF

01:05:35.331 --> 01:05:38.067
THEIR OWN. RULE REMOTE AND

01:05:38.134 --> 01:05:40.903
CANDIDLY. FOR KIDS AND- THE

01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:43.873
IT'S- THIS. PANDEMIC IS ONLY

01:05:43.939 --> 01:05:45.241
MADE THE CRISIS MORE CUTE. ON

01:05:45.308 --> 01:05:47.109
THAT QUICKLY I'M GONNA GO TO

01:05:47.176 --> 01:05:50.346
THE NEXT. ON THE OTHER CONCERN

01:05:50.413 --> 01:05:51.814
THAT I HAVE IS THAT DISTRICTS

01:05:51.881 --> 01:05:52.515
ARE PUTTING ALL THEIR APPLES

01:05:52.581 --> 01:05:54.116
INTO ONE BASKET I'M SAYING THAT

01:05:54.183 --> 01:05:55.217
WE'RE GOING TO BASE OUR RE

01:05:55.284 --> 01:05:56.852
OPENING AND WILL USE ON

01:05:56.919 --> 01:05:59.355
VACCINATIONS IN BECAUSE OF A

01:05:59.422 --> 01:06:01.390
VARIETY OF CHALLENGES BOTH

01:06:01.457 --> 01:06:02.325
NATIONALLY AS WELL AS HERE IN

01:06:02.391 --> 01:06:03.893
THE STATE. ON THERE NOT GONNA

01:06:03.959 --> 01:06:05.528
BE ABLE TO HIT THOSE

01:06:05.594 --> 01:06:06.162
REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE IN THERE

01:06:06.228 --> 01:06:10.099
AND- YOU- SO I'M ALSO VERY

01:06:10.166 --> 01:06:12.401
CONCERNED THAT WE HAVE THIS

01:06:12.468 --> 01:06:13.869
PATCHWORK ACROSS THE STATE OF

01:06:13.936 --> 01:06:15.871
SOME- DISTRICTS OPENING UP

01:06:15.938 --> 01:06:17.606
BASED OFF OF WEALTH SOME

01:06:17.673 --> 01:06:20.576
DISTRICTS OPENING UP THAT HAVE-

01:06:20.643 --> 01:06:22.545
HIGHER VACCINATION REGIMEN

01:06:22.611 --> 01:06:25.481
THAT'S FOCUSED. ON AND IF WE

01:06:25.548 --> 01:06:25.915
LOOK AT THE CHANGING

01:06:25.981 --> 01:06:29.118
VACCINATIONS- DEPLOYMENT BASED

01:06:29.185 --> 01:06:30.252
OFF OF THE NUMBER OF

01:06:30.319 --> 01:06:32.154
VACCINATIONS AVAILABLE THERE'S

01:06:32.221 --> 01:06:33.356
DISTRICTS IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL

01:06:33.422 --> 01:06:34.623
AND WILL USE IT WILL NEVER BE

01:06:34.690 --> 01:06:36.092
ABLE TO OPEN IF IT'S ALL BASED

01:06:36.158 --> 01:06:37.793
OFF OF GETTING THEIR STAFF

01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:39.995
VACCINATED. SO IF YOU DON'T

01:06:40.062 --> 01:06:41.130
MIND COMING HERE NEXT I THINK

01:06:41.197 --> 01:06:46.068
THAT IS A GROWING FIRE CANDIDLY.

01:06:46.135 --> 01:06:49.705
THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FACE.

01:06:49.772 --> 01:06:51.707
I ITEMS HOMES IF YOU WANT TO

01:06:51.774 --> 01:06:55.478
COMMENT ON THAT. AS CERTAINLY I

01:06:55.544 --> 01:06:57.847
THINK PERHAPS AND MY COLLEAGUE

01:06:57.913 --> 01:06:59.382
MISTER ALLEN MIGHT AND BE ABLE

01:06:59.448 --> 01:07:01.450
TO SPEAK A LITTLE MORE-

01:07:01.517 --> 01:07:03.219
ELOQUENTLY TO THAT TO THAT

01:07:03.285 --> 01:07:05.688
QUESTION SURE THANK YOU. YEAH I

01:07:05.755 --> 01:07:07.857
WOULD JUST SAY THAT I THINK OR

01:07:07.923 --> 01:07:08.357
WHAT BECOMES CRITICALLY

DON'T THINK THAT'S WITH THIS IS

01:14:23.258 --> 01:14:25.861
STILL BASED ON. HOW IT'S BEEN

01:14:25.928 --> 01:14:29.398
EXPLAINED TO US. IT SEEMS LIKE

01:14:29.464 --> 01:14:29.898
THERE'S BEEN A DATE THE

01:14:29.965 --> 01:14:32.901

THERE'S A DATE THAT'S UP

01:14:47.816 --> 01:14:49.751
WANTING TO BE OUT THERE AS THIS

01:14:49.818 --> 01:14:52.387

TO ANYONE INCLUDING THOSE WHO

01:15:02.764 --> 01:15:04.333
PARTY PRESENTED COLLECTIVE

01:15:04.399 --> 01:15:07.135
BARGAINING AGREEMENTS. HAVE THE

NUMBEROF IN SERVICING DAYS AND

01:15:12.975 --> 01:15:14.977
OTHER EMPLOYEES. SO WHY WOULD

01:15:15.043 --> 01:15:18.747
WE CREATE LOAD WE SET UP A DATE

01:15:18.814 --> 01:15:20.916
AND AGAIN I DON'T MEAN TO BE

01:15:20.983 --> 01:15:23.352
CRITICAL BUT I'M TRYING TO USE

01:15:23.418 --> 01:15:23.952
LEARNED LIVED EXPERIENCE OVER

01:15:24.019 --> 01:15:27.389
THE LAST. ELEVEN MONTHS WHY

01:15:27.456 --> 01:15:29.725
WOULD WE DO ANYTHING WITH

01:15:29.791 --> 01:15:31.360
REGARD TO COALBED BY SETTING UP

01:15:31.426 --> 01:15:34.730
A DATE- WITHOUT ACKNOWLEDGING

01:15:34.796 --> 01:15:36.431
THE CRITICAL PATH THAT WE KNOW

01:15:36.498 --> 01:15:39.101
EXISTS ON THE CRITICAL PATH IN

01:15:39.167 --> 01:15:40.836
THIS CASE WOULD BE. PUBLIC

01:15:40.903 --> 01:15:43.372
SCHOOL DISTRICTS THEY HAVE TO

01:15:43.438 --> 01:15:44.640
GO BACK IT'S IS NOT A QUESTION

01:15:44.706 --> 01:15:46.875
OF WHETHER THERE. WHETHER

01:15:46.942 --> 01:15:49.678
THEY'RE THEIR UNIONS- ARE ARE

01:15:49.745 --> 01:15:50.879
BEING OBSTRUCTIONISTS OR

01:15:50.946 --> 01:15:52.014
ANYTHING ELSE IN TERMS OF THE

01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:53.882
TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT

01:15:53.949 --> 01:15:55.317
THAT'S GONNA NEED TO BE

01:15:55.384 --> 01:15:56.018
NECESSARY TO OPEN THOSE DOORS

01:15:56.084 --> 01:15:59.388
UP. THEIR CONTRACTS.

01:15:59.454 --> 01:16:01.156
HISTORICALLY AND ALWAYS IS FAR

01:16:01.223 --> 01:16:03.992
AS I KNOW WILL HAVE. AN IN

01:16:04.059 --> 01:16:05.894
SERVICE DATES THAT ARE SET UP

01:16:05.961 --> 01:16:07.496
AND ESTABLISH AHEAD OF TIME FOR

01:16:07.562 --> 01:16:08.764
VARIOUS DISCIPLINES KNOWN

01:16:08.830 --> 01:16:10.866
ANTICIPATED THIS- SO THERE IS

01:16:10.933 --> 01:16:13.435
NO ONE. KNOWS CONTRACTS ARE

01:16:13.502 --> 01:16:15.837
GONNA ARE GOING TO. SCRIBE BUT

01:16:15.904 --> 01:16:17.673
IN SERVICE TRAINING FOR SCHOOL

01:16:17.739 --> 01:16:20.642
DISTRICT EMPLOYEES. FOR THIS.

01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:24.279
SO WE KNOW THAT. SO WOULD MAKE

01:16:24.346 --> 01:16:26.114
MORE SENSE TO INVEST IN IT AND

01:16:26.181 --> 01:16:27.883
BY THE WAY AS WE ALL KNOW IT

01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:29.084
TAKES MONEY TO DO THOSE IN

01:16:29.151 --> 01:16:30.452
SERVICE DATE SO WOULD MAKE MORE

01:16:30.519 --> 01:16:32.854
SENSE. TO START OFF Y SAYING

01:16:32.921 --> 01:16:34.923
OUR FIRST INVESTMENT WE REALLY

01:16:34.990 --> 01:16:36.425
WANT TO GET SCHOOLS OPEN WE ALL

01:16:36.491 --> 01:16:37.893
AGREED THAT AND HEARD ANYONE

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:39.795
SAY WE DON'T WANT IN PERSON

01:16:39.861 --> 01:16:40.729
INSTRUCTION START AS SOON AS

01:16:40.796 --> 01:16:42.664
POSSIBLE BUT IT. WOULD MAKE

01:16:42.731 --> 01:16:45.067
MORE SENSE TO SAY OUR INITIAL

01:16:45.133 --> 01:16:49.071
INVESTMENT. NEEDS TO BE TO GO.

01:16:49.137 --> 01:16:52.975
FUND THAT THE IN SERVICING THE

01:16:53.041 --> 01:16:53.575
INSERVICE TRAINING THAT NEEDS

01:16:53.642 --> 01:16:57.646
TO HAPPEN. IT CAN THAT. I THINK

01:16:57.713 --> 01:16:59.414
WE CAN SET A DATE THAT'S

01:16:59.481 --> 01:17:00.749
REASONABLE FOR WHEN THAT SHOULD

01:17:00.816 --> 01:17:03.518
BE ACCOMPLISHED IN SOON. MS ALL

01:17:03.585 --> 01:17:04.553
SAYING YOU HAVE TO GO SLOW TO

01:17:04.619 --> 01:17:06.922
GO FAST BUT I'M NOT SUGGESTING

01:17:06.989 --> 01:17:08.757
WE GO SLOW WOULD MAKE MORE

01:17:08.824 --> 01:17:11.059
SENSE. TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT

01:17:11.126 --> 01:17:12.828
OBVIOUS PLEASE IT'S NOT AS IF

01:17:12.894 --> 01:17:17.165
WE HAVE. I'M A- YOU KNOW SOME

01:17:17.232 --> 01:17:17.866
LARGE PERCENTAGE OF PUBLIC

01:17:17.933 --> 01:17:20.102

01:17:21.570 --> 01:17:22.938
REQUIREMENT. SO WOULDN'T WE

01:17:23.005 --> 01:17:25.173
JUST ATTACKED THAT. FIRST AND

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:27.242
THEN SOMEONE CAN BEGIN WITHOUT

01:17:27.309 --> 01:17:28.877
BEING REDUNDANT BECAUSE I SAID

01:17:28.944 --> 01:17:29.878
I AGREE WITH MUCH OF WHAT HAS

GET THOSE CALLS OR IS OUR

01:18:50.492 --> 01:18:51.760

GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ON HOW WE

01:33:00.007 --> 01:33:01.876

PLAN TO VACCINATE TEACHERS AND

01:33:28.369 --> 01:33:31.072
STAFF. RIGHT I JUST DIDN'T SEE

ANYTHING IN- SAY SCHOOLS FOR

01:33:34.608 --> 01:33:37.445
ALL PLAN REGARDING VACCINES-

01:33:37.511 --> 01:33:39.180
THE PLAN DOES NOT INCLUDE A

01:33:39.246 --> 01:33:41.682
REQUIREMENT AROUND VACCINES- IT

01:33:41.749 --> 01:33:43.250
REALLY WERE INCLUDED SAID THAT

01:33:43.317 --> 01:33:44.418

PARTICULAR PLAN OKAY I JUST

01:34:03.437 --> 01:34:04.605
PERSONALLY THINK IT'S HARD TO

01:34:04.672 --> 01:34:06.807
ASK- TEACHERS AND STAFF TO GO

01:34:06.874 --> 01:34:08.676

VACCINATE THEM AND WE DO KNOW

01:34:10.177 --> 01:34:11.345

ERICA COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH

01:35:41.735 --> 01:35:43.904
DEPARTMENT. AND I AM HAPPY TO

01:35:43.971 --> 01:35:45.773
SAY THAT AFTER THIRTEEN

01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:47.641
NEGOTIATION SESSIONS WITH OUR

01:35:47.708 --> 01:35:50.911
TEACHERS ASSOCIATION AND FOUR

01:35:50.978 --> 01:35:53.981
SESSIONS WITH OUR- CSEA

01:35:54.048 --> 01:35:56.617
CLASSIFIED UNITS AND WORKING

01:35:56.684 --> 01:35:59.987
WITH OUR PARENTS. WE WERE ABLE

01:36:00.054 --> 01:36:01.689
TO COME UP WITH A REAL OPENING

01:36:01.755 --> 01:36:03.958
PHASE PLANET VERY MUCH MIRRORS

01:36:04.024 --> 01:36:06.594
WHAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED HERE-

01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:07.895
THAT WE WOULD START WITH OUR

01:36:07.962 --> 01:36:10.331
MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS FIRST

01:36:10.397 --> 01:36:12.066
AND THEN WE WOULD START WITH

01:36:12.133 --> 01:36:15.736
OUR YOUNGEST AND- GRADUATE THAT

01:36:15.803 --> 01:36:17.905
UP. THAT IS ALL PREDICT ON US

01:36:17.972 --> 01:36:19.707
BEING IN THE RED TIER IN OUR

01:36:19.773 --> 01:36:22.376
COUNTY AND SO. WHEN I FIRST

01:36:22.443 --> 01:36:23.844
HEARD ABOUT THIS TWO BILLION

01:36:23.911 --> 01:36:25.546
DOLLARS I WAS QUITE EXCITED

01:36:25.613 --> 01:36:28.282
BECAUSE WE HAD MATT MOST OF THE

01:36:28.349 --> 01:36:30.451
METRICS AND THEN AS WE STARTED

01:36:30.518 --> 01:36:34.321
LOOKING CLOSER AT IT I BECAME.

01:36:34.388 --> 01:36:36.357
VERY DISILLUSIONED- I WAS

01:36:36.423 --> 01:36:38.058
CONCERNED ABOUT THE

01:36:38.125 --> 01:36:39.693
SURVEILLANCE REQUIREMENT FOR

01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:42.396
STUDENTS I HAD NOT. IN ANY OF

01:36:42.463 --> 01:36:43.898
BY MEETINGS HEARD THAT THAT WAS

01:36:43.964 --> 01:36:45.099
GOING TO BE PART OF THE

01:36:45.166 --> 01:36:47.635
EXPECTATION WE WERE ABLE TO

01:36:47.701 --> 01:36:49.670
STAND UP SURVEILLANCE TESTING

01:36:49.737 --> 01:36:52.840
FOR ALL STAFF. AND THAT HAPPENS

01:36:52.907 --> 01:36:55.776
MONTHLY. BUT THE REQUIREMENT

01:36:55.843 --> 01:36:58.245
FOR THE TUDENT TESTING REALLY

01:36:58.312 --> 01:37:00.614
MADE NO SENSE TO ME BECAUSE WE

01:37:00.681 --> 01:37:02.583
WERE PUSHING OUT THE SCIENCE

01:37:02.650 --> 01:37:06.187
FROM UCSF AND FROM STANFORD TO

01:37:06.253 --> 01:37:07.488
OUR FAMILIES SO THAT THEY WOULD

01:37:07.555 --> 01:37:08.856
FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE THAT WHEN

01:37:08.923 --> 01:37:11.158
WE'RE READY FOR. THE PHASE AND

01:37:11.225 --> 01:37:14.461
REOPENING. THE OUR OUR STUDENTS

01:37:14.528 --> 01:37:16.096
TWELVE AND UNDER JUST AREN'T AS

01:37:16.163 --> 01:37:18.699
IN AS MUCH DANGER AND SO WE

01:37:18.766 --> 01:37:20.601
WORK TOGETHER UNDERSTANDING OR

01:37:20.668 --> 01:37:22.836
TEACHERS UNION OUR CLASSIFIED

01:37:22.903 --> 01:37:25.272
STAFF HAVE NOT EVER. SUGGESTED

01:37:25.339 --> 01:37:26.974
THAT WE SHOULD TEST STUDENTS SO

01:37:27.041 --> 01:37:29.009
THEY WOULD FEEL MORE SAFE AND

01:37:29.076 --> 01:37:32.680
SO THEN LOOKING AT. THE EXPENSE

01:37:32.746 --> 01:37:34.982
FOR SURE BUT ALSO JUST THE

01:37:35.049 --> 01:37:36.850
ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITY I

01:37:36.917 --> 01:37:38.052
MEAN WE'VE ALREADY HAD TO STAND

01:37:38.118 --> 01:37:41.622
UP TRACKING AND TRACING WHICH

01:37:41.689 --> 01:37:42.990
YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE

01:37:43.057 --> 01:37:44.725
ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL FOR THESE.

01:37:44.792 --> 01:37:47.361
REQUIRE REST BUT WE HAVE

01:37:47.428 --> 01:37:48.896
FIGURED IT OUT AND SO WE HAVE

01:37:48.963 --> 01:37:52.099
PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN OPEN WE

01:37:52.166 --> 01:37:54.635
RUN PRESCHOOLS. WE ALSO RUN

01:37:54.702 --> 01:37:56.437
EXPANDED LEARNING AND WE HAVE

01:37:56.503 --> 01:37:58.672
HAD LEARNING LABS WHERE OUR

01:37:58.739 --> 01:38:00.307
MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS ARE

01:38:00.374 --> 01:38:01.475
COMING IN AND THEY'RE EITHER

01:38:01.542 --> 01:38:04.445
BEING SUPPORTED. BY CLASSIFIED

01:38:04.511 --> 01:38:07.414
STAFF- SO THAT THE STUDENTS ARE

01:38:07.481 --> 01:38:09.483
ABLE TO ENGAGE IN THEIR

01:38:09.550 --> 01:38:10.351
DISTANCE LEARNING BEING

01:38:10.417 --> 01:38:12.253
PROVIDED BY A CREDENTIALED

01:38:12.319 --> 01:38:14.488
TEACHER OR WE HAVE SOME OF OUR

01:38:14.555 --> 01:38:17.258
SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS. WHO

01:38:17.324 --> 01:38:19.226
EVEN BEFORE WE WERE IN RED

01:38:19.293 --> 01:38:20.594
WE'RE WILLING TO BRING THEIR

01:38:20.661 --> 01:38:22.263
STUDENTS END BUT WE DID THAT ON

01:38:22.329 --> 01:38:25.299
A VOLUNTARY BASIS RATHER THAN-

01:38:25.366 --> 01:38:27.001
REQUIRING OUR WHOLE SYSTEM TO

01:38:27.067 --> 01:38:29.403
COME BACK PRIOR TO WHAT WE ALL

01:38:29.470 --> 01:38:32.539
HAD AGREED TO. AND I HAVE A

01:38:32.606 --> 01:38:34.341
COUPLE OF QUESTIONS IN ADDITION

01:38:34.408 --> 01:38:36.076
TO THE STUDENT TESTING

01:38:36.143 --> 01:38:37.378
REQUIREMENT THAT WOULD BE

01:38:37.444 --> 01:38:40.447
EXTREMELY ONEROUS. AND I WAS IN

01:38:40.514 --> 01:38:41.382
A MEETING WHERE IT WAS

01:38:41.448 --> 01:38:43.350
DESCRIBED THAT STUDENTS COULD

01:38:43.417 --> 01:38:45.386
SELF ASSESS WELL SOMEONE'S

01:38:45.452 --> 01:38:46.687
GOING TO HAVETO MONITOR THAT

01:38:46.754 --> 01:38:48.989
PROCESS SELF ASSESSING

01:38:49.056 --> 01:38:50.591
SOMEONE'S GONNA HAVE TO COLLECT

01:38:50.658 --> 01:38:55.029
ALL OF THAT SOMEONE'S GOING TO

01:38:55.095 --> 01:38:56.230
HAVE TO TRACK THEM THAT'S- IN-

01:38:56.297 --> 01:38:57.931
THEN ALSO MINORS. IS THERE

01:38:57.998 --> 01:39:00.000
WOULD BE NO REQUIREMENT IF IT

01:39:00.067 --> 01:39:02.503
IF A PARENT DECIDED THEY DIDN'T

01:39:02.569 --> 01:39:04.438
WANT THEIR CHILD TESTED. THE

01:39:04.505 --> 01:39:05.806
CHILD WOULD STILL BE ALLOWED TO

01:39:05.873 --> 01:39:07.408
COME INTO THE SCHOOL SYSTEM

01:39:07.474 --> 01:39:08.809
WHICH I'M CONCERNED THAT WOULD

01:39:08.876 --> 01:39:13.814
CREATE. OF A SENSE OF- WORRY BY

01:39:13.881 --> 01:39:15.316
THE TEACHER THAT DIDN'T EXIST

01:39:15.382 --> 01:39:18.385
PRIOR TO THIS SO IF THEY HAD

01:39:18.452 --> 01:39:19.586
THREE STUDENTS TO REFUSE TO

01:39:19.653 --> 01:39:21.855
TEST NOW THEY BECOME SUSPICIOUS

01:39:21.922 --> 01:39:23.824
OF WHY THAT FAMILY WOULD.

01:39:23.891 --> 01:39:26.360
REFUSE TO TEST WHEREAS BEFORE

01:39:26.427 --> 01:39:28.295
IT WAS NEVER EVEN GOING TO BE

01:39:28.362 --> 01:39:31.198
AN ISSUE SO I HAVE THAT CONCERN

01:39:31.265 --> 01:39:33.100
I ALREADY HAVE THE CONCERN FROM

01:39:33.167 --> 01:39:36.970
A SCHOOL SYSTEM. THAT JUST THE

01:39:37.037 --> 01:39:38.772
CADENCE OF TESTING THAT WE'RE

01:39:38.839 --> 01:39:40.441
DOING WITH OUR STAFF WILL

01:39:40.507 --> 01:39:43.310
CERTAINLY PROBABLY INCREASED.

01:39:43.377 --> 01:39:44.545
CERTAINLY PROBABLY THAT DOESN'T

01:39:44.611 --> 01:39:46.613
SOUND VERY CONVINCING I BELIEVE

01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:48.415
WILL INCREASE OUR INSURANCE

01:39:48.482 --> 01:39:50.250
PREMIUMS WHICH WILL BE A

01:39:50.317 --> 01:39:52.119
ANOTHER ADDITIONAL COST TO US

01:39:52.186 --> 01:39:56.890
LOOKING FORWARD- AND SO MY ASK

01:39:56.957 --> 01:39:59.026
WOULD BE THAT THE TWO BILLION

01:39:59.093 --> 01:40:02.463
DOLLARS IS. FROM PROP NINETY

01:40:02.529 --> 01:40:03.497
EIGHT MONEY AND WHILE YOU KNOW

01:40:03.564 --> 01:40:05.466
I'VE HEARD THAT DISTRICTS CAN

01:40:05.532 --> 01:40:08.602
CHOOSE NOT TO APPLY FOR IT.

01:40:08.669 --> 01:40:12.773
IT'S NOT MY TRADITION TO LEAVE

01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:14.808
MONEY ON THE TABLE. I'M AND I

01:40:14.875 --> 01:40:16.577
DO BELIEVE THAT THAT WAS MONEY

01:40:16.643 --> 01:40:18.645
THAT WOULD GO TO SCHOOL

01:40:18.712 --> 01:40:19.613
DISTRICTS THAT'S BEING RE

01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:21.648
PULLED FOR CERTAIN SCHOOL

01:40:21.715 --> 01:40:24.518
DISTRICTS AND I AM- AS SENATOR

01:40:24.585 --> 01:40:26.787
CORTESE OUT ALREADY SHARED

01:40:26.854 --> 01:40:28.889
SANTA CLARA COUNTY HAS ITS-

01:40:28.956 --> 01:40:31.191
MANY DYNAMICS AND- YOU KNOW OUR

01:40:31.258 --> 01:40:32.993
PLAN DOESN'T REQUIRE

01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:35.763
VACCINATIONS BUT I WILL SAY I

01:40:35.829 --> 01:40:38.699
WAS VERY DISHEARTENED. TO LEARN

01:40:38.766 --> 01:40:41.201
THAT IN OUR COUNTY. I'M WE'RE

01:40:41.268 --> 01:40:44.171
NOWHERE NEAR GETTING TO THE

01:40:44.238 --> 01:40:47.274
LEVEL ONE BEAT FOR EDUCATORS

01:40:47.341 --> 01:40:49.343
JUST DOESN'T A PERSONALIZADO

01:40:49.410 --> 01:40:51.044
CAL FATHER WHO'S EIGHTY FIVE

01:40:51.111 --> 01:40:53.747
YEARS OLD AND HAS EMPHYSEMA WHO

01:40:53.814 --> 01:40:55.549
HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET HIS

01:40:55.616 --> 01:40:58.719
VACCINATION IN OUR COUNTY- AND

01:40:58.786 --> 01:41:01.588
SO. THERE ARE MANY WORRIES AND

01:41:01.655 --> 01:41:03.323
I ALSO APPRECIATE THE COMMENT

01:41:03.390 --> 01:41:06.660
ABOUT WHO ACTUALLY CONVEYS THIS

01:41:06.727 --> 01:41:09.329
INFORMATION AND TRIES TO BREAK

01:41:09.396 --> 01:41:11.632
IT DOWN TO OUR- AND COMMUNITY

01:41:11.698 --> 01:41:13.934
AND TO OUR STAFF AND SO WE'VE

01:41:14.001 --> 01:41:15.569
DEVELOPED THIS COMMUNICATION

01:41:15.636 --> 01:41:19.506
CADENCE AND IT'S TAKEN- ELEVEN

01:41:19.573 --> 01:41:21.775
MONTHS TO GET TRUST. THAT WE'RE

01:41:21.842 --> 01:41:24.511
NOT JUST MAKING THINGS. AND SO

01:41:24.578 --> 01:41:27.748
I WILL SAY THAT. I WAS VERY

01:41:27.815 --> 01:41:29.616
EXCITED THAT WE HAD OUR PLAN

01:41:29.683 --> 01:41:31.084
WE'RE SIMPLY WAITING FOR THE

01:41:31.151 --> 01:41:33.654
CONDITIONS TO IMPROVE AND WE'RE

01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:36.223
READY TO MOVE FORWARD AND IT

01:41:36.290 --> 01:41:39.626
FEELS LIKE YET AGAIN. THE GOAL

01:41:39.693 --> 01:41:41.662
POST MOVED AND LIKE THINGS HAVE

01:41:41.728 --> 01:41:43.597
CHANGED AND THERE ARE NEW

01:41:43.664 --> 01:41:45.466
REQUIREMENTS THAT WERE NEVER

01:41:45.532 --> 01:41:48.268
KNOWN BEFORE YOU KNOW THAT

01:41:48.335 --> 01:41:50.337
TWENTY FIVE CASE RATES PER

01:41:50.404 --> 01:41:51.104
HUNDRED THOUSAND THAT HAD NEVER

01:41:51.171 --> 01:41:52.940
EVEN BEEN A TERM THAT WAS USED

01:41:53.006 --> 01:41:55.609
BEFORE. SO WE WERE GOING OFF OF

01:41:55.676 --> 01:41:59.179
THE FOUR TIER SYSTEM I APPLAUD

01:41:59.246 --> 01:42:02.816
MY- RIGHT. LABOR PARTNERS FOR

01:42:02.883 --> 01:42:04.785
BEING COMFORTABLE TO COME BACK

01:42:04.852 --> 01:42:07.020
EVEN WHEN IT'S IN A SUBSTANTIAL

01:42:07.087 --> 01:42:10.123
RANGE. AND ALSO THE THIS SORT

01:42:10.190 --> 01:42:12.693
OF FALSE EXPECTATION IN MY

01:42:12.759 --> 01:42:15.529
OPINION. THAT IT'LL BE TOTALLY

01:42:15.596 --> 01:42:17.064
UP TO PARENTS WHETHER OR NOT

01:42:17.130 --> 01:42:18.999
THE KIDS ARE GOING TO RETURN OR

01:42:19.066 --> 01:42:21.468
IN PERSON INSTRUCTION BECAUSE

01:42:21.535 --> 01:42:23.904
AGAIN I'M JUST SHARING MY STORY

01:42:23.971 --> 01:42:26.573
WITH YOU BUT- BACK IN THE

01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:28.242
SUMMER THREE WEEKS BEFORE

01:42:28.308 --> 01:42:30.611
SCHOOL STARTED. WE ALLOWED

01:42:30.677 --> 01:42:33.180
FAMILIES WE LAID OUT OUR RE

01:42:33.247 --> 01:42:36.016
OPENING PLAN. AND WE ALLOWED

01:42:36.083 --> 01:42:38.819
FAMILIES TO SELECT IF THEY

01:42:38.886 --> 01:42:41.855
LEARNING OR IF THEY WANTED TO

01:42:41.922 --> 01:42:44.625
GO WITH A PHASED IN APPROACH AS

01:42:44.691 --> 01:42:46.293
IT WAS LAID OUT BASED ON THE

01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:49.096
TEARS AND ALL OF THAT. AND WE

01:42:49.162 --> 01:42:51.798
WERE THREE I'M IN ROLLED OUR

01:42:51.865 --> 01:42:54.201
ENTIRE SYSTEM. AND WE MOVE

01:42:54.268 --> 01:42:56.169
STAFF AND EVERYTHING SO THAT

01:42:56.236 --> 01:42:57.538
OUR PARENTS HAD THAT LEVEL OF

01:42:57.604 --> 01:43:00.173
COMFORT. AS I LOOK AT WHAT'S

01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:03.243
BEING PROPOSED. I READ IT AS

01:43:03.310 --> 01:43:04.044
THOUGH THERE WOULD BE AN

01:43:04.111 --> 01:43:06.213
EXPECTATION THAT WE WOULD YET

01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:07.848
AGAIN THIS LATE IN THE SCHOOL

01:43:07.915 --> 01:43:10.717
YEAR UP HE'D EVERYTHING ONCE

01:43:10.784 --> 01:43:12.352
AGAIN AND ALLOW PARENTS A

01:43:12.419 --> 01:43:15.289
SECOND CHOICE OF WHETHER THEY

01:43:15.355 --> 01:43:17.090
WANT TO DO THE FACE AND- RE

01:43:17.157 --> 01:43:18.892
OPENING THAT THEY AGREED TO BE

01:43:18.959 --> 01:43:21.595
FOR. WHICH WOULD REQUIRE US TO

01:43:21.662 --> 01:43:23.330
MOVE STAFF AND ALL OF THAT AND

01:43:23.397 --> 01:43:26.066
THERE'S BEEN MUCH CONVERSATION

01:43:26.133 --> 01:43:28.235
ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH. OF OUR

01:43:28.302 --> 01:43:29.670
STUDENTS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF

01:43:29.736 --> 01:43:31.505
DEVELOPING RELATIONSHIPS WITH

01:43:31.572 --> 01:43:33.740
OUR FAMILIES AND WE'VE BEEN

01:43:33.807 --> 01:43:35.709
ABLE TO REALLY GARNER AND

01:43:35.776 --> 01:43:38.478
LEVERAGED. A SYSTEM THAT

01:43:38.545 --> 01:43:40.614
SENATOR CORTESE IS VERY

01:43:40.681 --> 01:43:41.515
FAMILIAR WITH ITS CALLED

01:43:41.582 --> 01:43:43.150
SCHOOLING SERVICES WHERE WE CAN

01:43:43.216 --> 01:43:44.818
GET OUR FAMILIES CONNECTED TO

01:43:44.885 --> 01:43:47.354
RESOURCES. SO ONE OF MY BIGGEST

01:43:47.421 --> 01:43:48.755
CONCERNS WOULD BE TO CHANGE

01:43:48.822 --> 01:43:51.158
THOSE RELATIONSHIPS SO FAR INTO

01:43:51.224 --> 01:43:53.327
THE SCHOOL YEAR BY BASICALLY

01:43:53.393 --> 01:43:54.761
ALLOWING PARENTS TO CHOOSE

01:43:54.828 --> 01:43:55.896
WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE GOING TO

01:43:55.963 --> 01:43:57.564
STAY WITH THAT TEACHER THAT

01:43:57.631 --> 01:44:00.734
THEY'VE BEEN WITH. FOR THESE

01:44:00.801 --> 01:44:02.569
SIX MONTHS OF THIS SCHOOL YEAR.

01:44:02.636 --> 01:44:04.571
SO YOU KNOW I HAVE MANY MORE

01:44:04.638 --> 01:44:06.640
THINGS THAT I COULD SHARE AND

01:44:06.707 --> 01:44:07.574
WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER

01:44:07.641 --> 01:44:11.278
QUESTIONS. BUT I JUST WANTED TO

01:44:11.345 --> 01:44:12.546
LAY OUT. THE PRICE THAT WE'VE

01:44:12.613 --> 01:44:14.081
WORKED THROUGH WE WORK THROUGH

01:44:14.147 --> 01:44:16.183
EACH PHASE OF THAT WITH THE

01:44:16.249 --> 01:44:18.285
UNDERSTANDING OF THE PLAN THAT

01:44:18.352 --> 01:44:20.954
HAD BEEN PROVIDED TO US AND SO

01:44:21.021 --> 01:44:22.923
TO HAVE THAT PLAN CHANGE AND TO

01:44:22.990 --> 01:44:25.392
HAVE THINGS MOVE. AND TO BE

01:44:25.459 --> 01:44:28.629
TOLD WELL IT'S OKAY YOU COULD

01:44:28.695 --> 01:44:30.897
JUST NOT GO FOR THE MONEY. THAT

01:44:30.964 --> 01:44:33.367
THAT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE I'M NOT

01:44:33.433 --> 01:44:35.469
DOING THE MOST FOR MY STUDENTS

01:44:35.535 --> 01:44:37.437
AND MY FAMILIES TO LEAVE MONEY

01:44:37.504 --> 01:44:40.574
ON THE TABLE. SO BUT I ALSO

01:44:40.641 --> 01:44:42.809
VALUE A LONG TERM RELATIONSHIP

01:44:42.876 --> 01:44:45.479
WITH MY LABOR GROUPS MORE THAN

01:44:45.545 --> 01:44:47.381
THAT THAT FOUR HUNDRED AND

01:44:47.447 --> 01:44:49.182
FIFTY DOLLARS PER STUDENTS. AND

01:44:49.249 --> 01:44:51.184
SO WE HAVE AGREEMENTS WE'RE

01:44:51.251 --> 01:44:51.685
GOING TO STAY WITH THE

01:44:51.752 --> 01:44:54.187
AGREEMENTS. BUT I'D ALSO LIKE

01:44:54.254 --> 01:44:55.489
TO BE ABLE TO GET SOME OF THAT

01:44:55.555 --> 01:44:58.191
FUNDING WHEN THE CONDITIONS

NEGOTIATION. WITH OUR UNIONS. I

01:52:18.731 --> 01:52:19.632
HAVE BEEN DOWN ALL OF THE- WHEN

WE LOOK. THE PLAN THAT THE

01:52:21.301 --> 01:52:23.803
GOVERNOR'S LAID OUT. THE PLAN

01:52:23.870 --> 01:52:26.639
SIMPLY WILL NOT HELP US IT

01:52:26.706 --> 01:52:29.075
WON'T HELP US GET TO RE OPENING

01:52:29.142 --> 01:52:31.878

THAT AS YOU KNOW FROM OUR

01:52:33.613 --> 01:52:35.582
PERSPECTIVE WE DO NOT NEED

01:52:35.648 --> 01:52:39.652
FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO REOPEN.

01:52:39.719 --> 01:52:41.721
WE NEEDED TO BE SAFE WHEN IT'S

01:52:41.788 --> 01:52:43.923
SAFE WE ARE READY TO REOPEN AND

01:52:43.990 --> 01:52:45.592
WE INTEND TO REOPEN WE

01:52:45.658 --> 01:52:46.893
CERTAINLY NEED FINANCIAL

01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:49.295
SUPPORT TO PAY FOR ALL OF THE

01:52:49.362 --> 01:52:51.798
THINGS OUR STUDENTS NEED BUT

01:52:51.865 --> 01:52:53.666
IT'S NOT ABOUT. FINANCIAL

01:52:53.733 --> 01:52:55.935
INCENTIVES WILL PUSH US I TO

01:52:56.002 --> 01:52:58.371
REOPEN MORE QUICKLY THAN WHEN

01:52:58.438 --> 01:53:00.006
WE BELIEVE IT'S ACTUALLY SAFE

01:53:00.073 --> 01:53:02.775
TO DO SO OUR CASE RATE IN SAN

01:53:02.842 --> 01:53:05.145
DIEGO OUNTY TODAY. ADJUSTED

01:53:05.211 --> 01:53:07.580
CREEK CASE RATE IS OVER SIXTY

01:53:07.647 --> 01:53:09.449
PER HUNDRED THOUSAND THE IDEA

01:53:09.516 --> 01:53:10.450
THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ANYWHERE

01:53:10.517 --> 01:53:12.752
NEAR THAT TWENTY FIVE PER

01:53:12.819 --> 01:53:14.420
HUNDRED THOUSAND. WITHIN A

01:53:14.487 --> 01:53:15.588
COUPLE OF WEEKS WITH IT YOU

01:53:15.655 --> 01:53:19.826
KNOW BY MID FEBRUARY IT'S

01:53:19.893 --> 01:53:20.827
SIMPLY NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. THE

01:53:20.894 --> 01:53:22.562
IDEA THAT IT WOULD EVEN GET

01:53:22.629 --> 01:53:24.364
DOWN YOU KNOW INTO INTO THAT

01:53:24.430 --> 01:53:27.300
LEVEL BY MARCH OR APRIL IS VERY

01:53:27.367 --> 01:53:28.768
MUCH UP IN THE AIR OF COURSE WE

01:53:28.835 --> 01:53:30.570
HAVE NOW A SECOND STRAIN. OF

01:53:30.637 --> 01:53:31.871
THE VIRUS YOU KNOW THAT'S

01:53:31.938 --> 01:53:34.107
MOVING FORWARD THAT MAY CREATE

01:53:34.174 --> 01:53:35.241
FOR ALL WE KNOW A NEW SEARCH

01:53:35.308 --> 01:53:36.576
AND BY THE WAY WE'RE NOT

01:53:36.643 --> 01:53:38.711
WAITING WE'RE GOING BACK TO OUR

01:53:38.778 --> 01:53:41.714
UCSD EXPERTS. INSANE LET US

01:53:41.781 --> 01:53:43.516
KNOW HOW THE SCIENCE IS

01:53:43.583 --> 01:53:45.785
APPALLED AND GIVE US NEW.

01:53:45.852 --> 01:53:48.688
GUIDANCE ABOUT WHAT SAFE I

01:53:48.755 --> 01:53:52.825
THREE OPEN. WITH ALL OF THAT IN

01:53:52.892 --> 01:53:53.860
PLACE HE WHAT WE ACTUALLY DO

01:53:53.927 --> 01:53:57.797
ANY. WE NEED. TO GET OUR AND-

01:53:57.864 --> 01:54:01.401
BACK. AS QUICKLY AS- THAT HAS

01:54:01.467 --> 01:54:03.102
TO. AND IT IS ENTIRELY UP. FOR

01:54:03.169 --> 01:54:05.371
OUR EDGE. GIVEN THE RATE THAT

01:54:05.438 --> 01:54:07.941
ARE IN OUR COMMUNITY TO STAY.

01:54:08.007 --> 01:54:10.009
NOW THAT WERE ON THE VERGE OF

01:54:10.076 --> 01:54:13.313
HAVING A VACCINE AVAILABLE. WE

01:54:13.379 --> 01:54:15.281
SHOULD GET THAT VACCINE ARE

01:54:15.348 --> 01:54:17.317
BEFORE WE TAKE A RISK AND GO

01:54:17.383 --> 01:54:19.552
BACK SO WE NEED THAT VACCINE

01:54:19.619 --> 01:54:21.321
AND WE NEED IT AS URGENTLY AS

01:54:21.387 --> 01:54:23.790
POSSIBLE. WE NEED THE FUNDING

01:54:23.856 --> 01:54:25.091
TO POKE FULLY PAY FOR THE

01:54:25.158 --> 01:54:26.960
TESTING SOME OF YOUR QUESTIONS

01:54:27.026 --> 01:54:28.995
WERE SO ON POINT. UNDER THE

01:54:29.062 --> 01:54:31.764
GOVERNOR'S PLAN IF WE WERE TO

01:54:31.831 --> 01:54:33.933
TEST ONCE A WEEK THAT WOULD BE

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.869
ABOUT SIXTEEN TESTS. BETWEEN

01:54:36.936 --> 01:54:38.404
MID FEBRUARY AND THE END OF

01:54:38.471 --> 01:54:40.440
THIS SCHOOL YEAR. OUR

01:54:40.506 --> 01:54:42.175
ARRANGEMENT WITH UC SAN DIEGO

01:54:42.242 --> 01:54:44.110
IS FOR FORTY DOLLARS A TEST

01:54:44.177 --> 01:54:46.512
WHICH IS THE ENTIRE TESTING

01:54:46.579 --> 01:54:47.780
PLUS THE INFRASTRUCTURE. SO

01:54:47.847 --> 01:54:52.051
THAT'S. SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY

01:54:52.118 --> 01:54:53.052
DOLLARS PER STUDENT. THAT'S THE

01:54:53.119 --> 01:54:56.856
IN. REAL RIGHT RIGHT THERE IF

01:54:56.923 --> 01:54:57.490
WE WERE TO SPUR ALL THAT

01:54:57.557 --> 01:54:58.458
TESTING AND BY THE WAY WE DON'T

01:54:58.524 --> 01:55:01.628
BELIEVE. THAT PROP NINETY EIGHT

01:55:01.694 --> 01:55:02.262
SHOULD BE PAYING FOR HEALTH AND

01:55:02.328 --> 01:55:04.797
SAFETY MEASURES LIKE TESTING.

01:55:04.864 --> 01:55:06.866
THAT SHOULD COME OUT OF THE

01:55:06.933 --> 01:55:08.935
STATE RECEIVED OVER A BILLION

01:55:09.002 --> 01:55:10.503
DOLLARS IN THE MOST RECENT

01:55:10.570 --> 01:55:12.405
COVERED RELIEF FIND FOR TESTING

01:55:12.472 --> 01:55:13.906
WE KNOW THAT THE BY DID

01:55:13.973 --> 01:55:15.775
ADMINISTRATION RIGHT NOW IS

01:55:15.842 --> 01:55:18.544
TRYING TO MOVE ADDITIONAL

01:55:18.611 --> 01:55:19.779
TESTING AVAILABLE FOR SCHOOLS.

01:55:19.846 --> 01:55:21.514
THAT'S THE APPROPRIATE PLACE TO

01:55:21.581 --> 01:55:22.849
PAY FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY

01:55:22.915 --> 01:55:25.285
MEASURES LIKE TESTING BECAUSE

01:55:25.351 --> 01:55:26.152
WATER WE NEED THE PROP NINETY

01:55:26.219 --> 01:55:27.720
EIGHT TWENTY FOUR. WE NEED IT

01:55:27.787 --> 01:55:31.024
NOW. FOR OUR STUDENTS THAT NEED

01:55:31.090 --> 01:55:34.427
SUPPORT NOW. WE HAVE A NEED FOR

01:55:34.494 --> 01:55:35.995
THE EXTRA CANCELING WE HAVEN'T

01:55:36.062 --> 01:55:38.665
NEED FOR EXTRA TIME WITH OUR

01:55:38.731 --> 01:55:39.799
STUDENTS EVEN IF THEY ARE

01:55:39.866 --> 01:55:41.801
CONTINUING A DISTANCE LEARNING

01:55:41.868 --> 01:55:43.202
WE HAVE THE NEED FOR SOCIAL

01:55:43.269 --> 01:55:44.404
WORKERS WHO CAN HELP OUR

01:55:44.470 --> 01:55:46.873
FAMILIES NAVIGATE. I SERVICES

01:55:46.939 --> 01:55:48.641
AND SUPPORTS THAT THAT ARE

01:55:48.708 --> 01:55:50.643
IMPORTANT TO THEM WHEN WE ARE

01:55:50.710 --> 01:55:54.180
TRYING TO EXPAND OUR ON CAMPUS

01:55:54.247 --> 01:55:56.215
I IN PERSON SERVICES FOR OUR

01:55:56.282 --> 01:55:57.617
MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS AND BY

01:55:57.684 --> 01:55:58.885
THE WAY WE'VE- AYE THAT

01:55:58.951 --> 01:56:01.621
INCLUDES PRESCHOOL ELEMENTARY

01:56:01.688 --> 01:56:02.588
MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL

01:56:02.655 --> 01:56:05.024
STUDENTS. BUT THAT REQUIRES

01:56:05.091 --> 01:56:07.126
RESOURCES TO PROVIDE THE KIND

01:56:07.193 --> 01:56:09.195
OF I SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS NEEDS

01:56:09.262 --> 01:56:11.931
SO IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO HAVE

01:56:11.998 --> 01:56:13.766
TWO BILLION DOLLARS A PROP

01:56:13.833 --> 01:56:15.335
NINETY EIGHT MONEY THAT WE WILL

01:56:15.401 --> 01:56:18.104
NOT BE ABLE TO USE. THAT WE ARE

01:56:18.171 --> 01:56:20.173
I WOULD BE VERY UNLIKELY BE

01:56:20.239 --> 01:56:22.008
ABLE TO USE FOR MOST OF OUR

01:56:22.075 --> 01:56:23.643
STUDENTS CERTAINLY FOR MIDDLE

01:56:23.710 --> 01:56:25.111
AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. ANY

01:56:25.178 --> 01:56:26.813
TIME DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR TO

01:56:26.879 --> 01:56:28.981
TAKE THAT TWO BILLION DOLLARS

01:56:29.048 --> 01:56:30.483
AND HAVE IT SITTING IN A POT

01:56:30.550 --> 01:56:32.752
THAT WE CAN'T USE WHEN WE HAVE

01:56:32.819 --> 01:56:37.357
REAL NEEDS RIGHT NOW. FOR OUR-STUDENTS SO OUR RECOMMENDATION

01:56:37.423 --> 01:56:40.393
WOULD BE. IN ADDITION TO THE

01:56:40.460 --> 01:56:41.961
FOUR POINT SIX BILLION DOLLAR

01:56:42.028 --> 01:56:44.464
HI I PROPOSAL FOR INTERVENTION

01:56:44.530 --> 01:56:45.965
FOR STUDENTS THAT WE CAN USE

01:56:46.032 --> 01:56:48.034
NOW AND INTO THE SUMMER

01:56:48.101 --> 01:56:50.670
ACTUALLY I PLAN FOR THE

01:56:50.737 --> 01:56:52.372
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THAT OUR

01:56:52.438 --> 01:56:54.440
STUDENTS ARE GOING TO NEED. TO

01:56:54.507 --> 01:56:55.875
OVERCOME WHAT THEY'VE

01:56:55.942 --> 01:56:57.543
EXPERIENCED IN THE PANDEMIC.

01:56:57.610 --> 01:56:59.379
TAKE THAT FOUR POINT SIX

01:56:59.445 --> 01:57:01.214
BILLION DOLLARS OF PROP NINETY

01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:03.583
EIGHT BUNNY. ADD TO THAT THE

01:57:03.649 --> 01:57:05.518
TWO BILLION DOLLARS THAT RIGHT

01:57:05.585 --> 01:57:07.286
NOW IS IN A FRANKLY UNWORKABLE

01:57:07.353 --> 01:57:09.222
PLAN. THAT THE GOVERNOR WAS PUT

01:57:09.288 --> 01:57:12.525
INTO RE OPENING AND ALLOW US TO

01:57:12.592 --> 01:57:14.927
USE THOSE RESOURCES TO MEET THE

01:57:14.994 --> 01:57:17.263
NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS NOW AND

01:57:17.330 --> 01:57:18.564
THEN TO PLAN FOR THE SUMMER AND

01:57:18.631 --> 01:57:20.032
THEN TO FOCUS ON WHAT OUR

01:57:20.099 --> 01:57:21.467
STUDENTS ARE GOING TO NEED

01:57:21.534 --> 01:57:23.002
GOING INTO THE FOLLOWING YEAR.

01:57:23.069 --> 01:57:25.505
AND WHEN IT IS SAFE TO RE OPEN

01:57:25.571 --> 01:57:31.411
WE. WILL RE OPEN AT THAT POINT.

01:57:31.477 --> 01:57:32.912
WHEN WE HAVE THEIR BACKS. WHEN

01:57:32.979 --> 01:57:34.781
THE FINE. I HAD TO DO FULL TEN

01:57:34.847 --> 01:57:36.149
THAT. THAT PUBLIC HEALTH

01:57:36.215 --> 01:57:38.050
EXPERTS ADVISE US TO DO. AND

01:57:38.117 --> 01:57:39.419
WHEN THE CASE RATES. HAVE COME

01:57:39.485 --> 01:57:40.620
DOWN TO A POINT. THAT IT WILL

01:57:40.686 --> 01:57:42.455
ASK BE SO. YOU KNOW FOR OUR OUR

01:57:42.522 --> 01:57:43.689
STUDENTS AND OUR STAFF TO RE

01:57:43.756 --> 01:57:45.658
OPEN AND I WOULD JUST LEAVE YOU

01:57:45.725 --> 01:57:47.160
WITH KIND OF YOU KNOW THIS.

01:57:47.226 --> 01:57:48.694
THIS IS WHAT YOU KNOW KEEPS ME

01:57:48.761 --> 01:57:50.997
UP AT NIGHT. IN MY DISTRICT WE

01:57:51.063 --> 01:57:52.865
HAVE A LOT OF IMMIGRANT PARENTS

01:57:52.932 --> 01:57:55.001
A LOT OF PARENTS WHO TRUST THE

01:57:55.067 --> 01:57:56.903
PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. WHEN WE

01:57:56.969 --> 01:58:00.807
SAY TO OUR PARENTS. IT IS SAFE

01:58:00.873 --> 01:58:02.141
FOR YOUR KIDS TO COME BACK TO

01:58:02.208 --> 01:58:05.044
SCHOOL. AND WE HAVE THE RIGHT

01:58:05.111 --> 01:58:06.479
INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAM THAT'S

01:58:06.546 --> 01:58:08.247
GOING TO HELP YOUR KIDS LEARN.

01:58:08.314 --> 01:58:10.917
WHEN WE TELL OUR PARENTS THAT.

01:58:10.983 --> 01:58:13.019
THEY WILL BELIEVE US. SO WE

01:58:13.085 --> 01:58:15.588
BETTER GET IT RIGHT. AND WE

01:58:15.655 --> 01:58:17.890
BETTER BE MOTIVATED BY WHAT

01:58:17.957 --> 01:58:19.525
ACTUALLY WILL KEEP OUR STUDENTS

01:58:19.592 --> 01:58:20.993
AND OUR STAFF SAFE WHAT

01:58:21.060 --> 01:58:22.995
ACTUALLY IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE

01:58:23.062 --> 01:58:24.864
INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAM FOR OUR

01:58:24.931 --> 01:58:26.566
KIDS AND THAT BETTER BE OUR

01:58:26.632 --> 01:58:28.668
ONLY MOTIVATION AS WE THINK

01:58:28.734 --> 01:58:30.503
ABOUT MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS

01:58:30.570 --> 01:58:32.438
PROCESS AFTER THE REST OF THIS

01:58:32.505 --> 01:58:34.607
YEAR INTO THE SUMMER AND NEXT

01:58:34.674 --> 01:58:37.043

SACRAMENTO THAT IN SMALLER

02:09:24.256 --> 02:09:25.324
COUNTIES AND EVEN IN

02:09:25.390 --> 02:09:27.025
NEIGHBORING COUNTIES. THAT

IS URBAN. SO IT'LL TAKE MORE

02:09:37.436 --> 02:09:38.804
TIME AND THERE ARE MORE MEDICAL

02:09:38.871 --> 02:09:40.806
PROFESSIONALS WHEN I HEAR

02:09:40.873 --> 02:09:43.008
PEOPLE SAY URBAN I WONDER WHY

02:09:43.075 --> 02:09:44.443
THE SECOND MOST DIVERSE SCHOOL

02:09:44.510 --> 02:09:46.078

02:09:46.145 --> 02:09:47.312
OF THE MOST INTEGRATED CITIES

02:09:47.379 --> 02:09:50.215
IN THE NATION SACRAMENTO IS NOT

02:09:50.282 --> 02:09:51.049
WITH OTHER REGIONS IN FRONT OF

02:09:51.116 --> 02:09:53.185
THE LINE. TO ME IT'S AN EQUITY

02:09:53.252 --> 02:09:54.987
ISSUE A COLLECTION OF

02:09:55.053 --> 02:09:56.722
SUPERINTENDENTS WERE INFORMED

02:09:56.788 --> 02:09:58.724
THAT THE COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO

02:09:58.790 --> 02:10:00.092
NOT NECESSARILY THE HEALTH

02:10:00.159 --> 02:10:02.694
PROVIDERS IN SACRAMENTO BUT THE

02:10:02.761 --> 02:10:06.131
COUNTY ITSELF RECEIVE JUST NINE

02:10:06.198 --> 02:10:07.799
HUNDRED AND CHANGE VACCINES

02:10:07.866 --> 02:10:10.469
LAST WEEK. JUST NINE HUNDRED

02:10:10.536 --> 02:10:11.870
AND CHANGE VACCINES IN THE

02:10:11.937 --> 02:10:14.039
COUNTY'S LARGE OF OURS MEANS

02:10:14.106 --> 02:10:15.841
THAT- AS I HEARD A FEW PEOPLE

02:10:15.908 --> 02:10:17.943
MENTION EARLIER. I AM NOW

02:10:18.010 --> 02:10:19.444
CONCERNED ABOUT THE OPENING OF

02:10:19.511 --> 02:10:23.115
SCHOOLS IN AUGUST OF TWENTY

02:10:23.182 --> 02:10:24.283

02:10:24.349 --> 02:10:25.951
OUR SCHOOLS WHAT WE REALLY NEED

02:10:26.018 --> 02:10:27.986
IS THAT VACCINATION PLAN TO GET

02:10:28.053 --> 02:10:29.154
THOSE MILLION THAT ARE STILL

02:10:29.221 --> 02:10:31.757
WAITING TO BE DISTRIBUTED OUT

02:10:31.823 --> 02:10:33.358
TO URBAN AREAS. LET'S TAKE THIS

02:10:33.425 --> 02:10:35.194
PROPORTIONALITY IN DISPARITY

02:10:35.260 --> 02:10:37.863
HAD ON. NUST HAS HAD THEIR OWN

02:10:37.930 --> 02:10:39.231
TESTING SITE WITH THIS

02:10:39.298 --> 02:10:40.766
SACRAMENTO COUNTY AND WE'VE

ONE DAY A WEEK OF TESTING

02:10:46.071 --> 02:10:48.006

CONTACT TRACING FOR EMPLOYEES

02:10:49.708 --> 02:10:51.843

FAIRLY UNIQUE. I HEAR FROM

02:10:53.946 --> 02:10:54.813
COLLEAGUES AT THE CADENCE OF

02:10:54.880 --> 02:10:56.615
TESTING THAT'S BEING PROPOSED

02:10:56.682 --> 02:10:58.417
FOR MANY DISTRICTS WILL PREVENT

02:10:58.483 --> 02:11:00.519
THE RE OPENING AND MAYBE EVEN

02:11:00.586 --> 02:11:01.987
FOR SOME THAT ARE ALREADY OPEN

02:11:02.054 --> 02:11:03.689
A RETURN TO DISTANCE EARNING.

02:11:03.755 --> 02:11:05.290
I TO OF HEARD THAT MANY WILL

02:11:05.357 --> 02:11:06.992
NOT APPLY FOR THE GRANT. IN

02:11:07.059 --> 02:11:08.694
PARTICULAR BECAUSE OF THE

02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:10.796
CADENCE OF TESTING. I'M GLAD TO

02:11:10.862 --> 02:11:12.497

02:11:12.564 --> 02:11:15.267
WORKING ON THAT CADENCE WELL

02:11:15.334 --> 02:11:15.867
BASED ON SOME OF THE TESTIMONY

RAPID COBIT TESTING IN ADDITION

02:11:36.455 --> 02:11:37.856

FOOTBALL STADIUMS. GYMS AND

02:12:01.246 --> 02:12:03.649
AMAZING STAFF THAT WOULD BE

02:12:03.715 --> 02:12:05.050
WILLING TO STEP UP AND HELP. I

02:12:05.117 --> 02:12:06.018
BELIEVE IT'S TIME FOR

02:12:06.084 --> 02:12:08.120
CALIFORNIA TO BE READY TO

02:12:08.186 --> 02:12:10.122
RAPIDLY INTO THE BEST OF OUR

02:12:10.188 --> 02:12:13.158
ABILITY AS A STATE TO EQUITABLY

02:12:13.225 --> 02:12:15.160
EXPAND THE VACCINES AS FAST AS

02:12:15.227 --> 02:12:16.762
THE FEDS IN THE PHARMACEUTICALS

02:12:16.828 --> 02:12:18.664
WILL PROVIDE US WITH THEM. WE

02:12:18.730 --> 02:12:20.232
MUST REMEMBER THAT PERFECTION

02:12:20.299 --> 02:12:22.901

02:12:22.968 --> 02:12:24.136
LET US PROVE WE CAN BE PART OF

02:12:24.202 --> 02:12:26.204

TO US FOR A TASK AND RE OPENING

02:12:30.609 --> 02:12:32.444
THAT MAKES REAL OPENING IN

02:12:32.511 --> 02:12:34.913
PURSING AND- LESS LIKELY. GIVE

02:12:34.980 --> 02:12:36.682

02:24:41.572 --> 02:24:43.641
THE REASONS THAT. YOU KNOW WE

02:24:43.708 --> 02:24:44.976

IS WHETHER IT BACK

02:25:24.849 --> 02:25:26.551
INFRASTRUCTURE WOULD ACTUALLY

02:25:26.617 --> 02:25:37.161
ALLOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THAT

02:25:37.228 --> 02:25:37.728

IN INTO OF THE ACCESS TO THE

02:25:58.883 --> 02:26:00.852
STATE- MY AT MY STOP MOSTLY

02:26:00.918 --> 02:26:01.652
INTERACTS THE STATE AND THEY

02:26:01.719 --> 02:26:03.454
NOT HAD ASKED ME WHY. TO STEP

02:26:03.521 --> 02:26:04.188
IN A TRY TO GET EXTRA SOME TO

02:26:04.255 --> 02:26:05.723
GUIDE THEY'VE VERY BY. OUR

02:26:05.790 --> 02:26:08.025
SACRAMENTO PA HEALTH BEEN SENT-

02:26:08.092 --> 02:26:08.993
THE DEATH NEED MORE BODIES MORE

02:26:09.060 --> 02:26:10.361
BE THEIR OWN. BUT EVERY TWO. I

02:26:10.428 --> 02:26:11.529
CALL DOCTOR CONSIDERING IT

02:26:15.500 --> 02:26:15.967
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE'S

02:26:16.033 --> 02:26:17.668
DOING THAT- KNOWING THAT I'M

02:26:17.735 --> 02:26:19.370
JUST ONE OF PROBABLY HUNDREDS

02:26:19.437 --> 02:26:21.205
OR CALLING HER EACH DAY. IN

02:26:21.272 --> 02:26:23.508
TERMS OF PARENTS AND STOP BEING

02:26:23.574 --> 02:26:25.443
ADEQUATELY EDUCATED ABSOLUTELY

02:26:25.510 --> 02:26:29.213
NOT I MEAN I DON'T KNOW FOR

02:26:29.280 --> 02:26:29.814
SURE IF THIS IS OUR FOURTH OR

02:26:29.881 --> 02:26:31.916
FIFTH- GUIDANCE FOR SCHOOLS- IT

02:26:31.983 --> 02:26:33.451
CHANGES SO MUCH. AND THEN AND

02:26:33.518 --> 02:26:35.052
THEN PURPLE THEN BECAUSE I PER.

02:26:35.119 --> 02:26:39.056
AND YOU KNOW START. WE WORK ALL

02:26:39.123 --> 02:26:40.358
BUT THEN WE WERE ASKED TO CLOSE

02:26:40.424 --> 02:26:41.792
DOWN AND THEN WE WERE ALLOWED

02:26:41.859 --> 02:26:44.462
TO EAT OUTSIDE AGAIN AND- AND I

02:26:44.529 --> 02:26:45.229
CAN'T EVEN EXPLAIN IT TO MY OWN

02:26:45.296 --> 02:26:49.167
FAMILY. AND SO WHEN IT COMES TO

02:26:49.233 --> 02:26:52.003
THAT KIND OF CONFUSION- IT'S

02:26:52.069 --> 02:26:54.138
VERY FRUSTRATING I ALSO NEED TO

02:26:54.205 --> 02:26:55.640
POINT OUT THAT AS WE TALK ABOUT

02:26:55.706 --> 02:26:57.441
TESTING IS A MAJOR PART. I SAID

02:26:57.508 --> 02:27:00.745
OUR DISTRICT EXECUTED- I AGREE

02:27:00.811 --> 02:27:02.513
WITH RICHARD YOU SAID IF THE

02:27:02.580 --> 02:27:04.015
COMMUNITY HAS STARTED ALREADY

02:27:04.081 --> 02:27:05.616
THEY'RE- CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO

02:27:05.683 --> 02:27:07.552
BE ABLE TO DO IT. IN IN LITTLE

02:27:07.618 --> 02:27:09.220
ON THE SHORT TIME FRAME IT TOOK

02:27:09.287 --> 02:27:10.555
US MONTHS TO POLITICALLY

02:27:10.621 --> 02:27:12.156
CONVINCED PEOPLE WE CAN DO IT.

02:27:12.223 --> 02:27:13.691
AND THEN WE STARTED IT AND THEN

02:27:13.758 --> 02:27:15.293
WE HAD A SHORTAGE OF TESTING

02:27:15.359 --> 02:27:16.427
AND THEN WE NOW WE'VE WE'VE HAD

02:27:16.494 --> 02:27:18.362
A CADENCE. BUT IT IS NOT AN

02:27:18.429 --> 02:27:19.530
EASY THING TO DO AND YOU HAVE

02:27:19.597 --> 02:27:21.666
TO HAVE TALENTED PEOPLE. WITHIN

02:27:21.732 --> 02:27:23.134
YOUR DISTRICT WHICH IS TALKED

02:27:23.201 --> 02:27:24.602
ABOUT HOW GIFTED. HE IS OUR

02:27:24.669 --> 02:27:25.937
DISTRICT I FEEL THE VERY SAME

02:27:26.003 --> 02:27:27.505
WAY WE HAVE EXTREMELY TALENTED

02:27:27.572 --> 02:27:29.207
PEOPLE. PEOPLE ARE BUYING

02:27:29.273 --> 02:27:31.409
TESTING IS THE ANSWER AND ALL

02:27:31.475 --> 02:27:33.377
POLITICS ASIDE. I THINK THE

02:27:33.444 --> 02:27:35.112
WHITE HOUSE TESTING PLAN AND

02:27:35.179 --> 02:27:37.415
HOW SOUTH THAT WENT SO QUICK-

02:27:37.481 --> 02:27:39.217
AND HOW MUCH THAT WS COVERED-

02:27:39.283 --> 02:27:40.685
ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND IN

02:27:40.751 --> 02:27:42.920
SOCIAL MEDIA. PEOPLE ARE BUYING

02:27:42.987 --> 02:27:44.789
TESTING IS THE ANSWER- THEY ARE

02:27:44.855 --> 02:27:46.023
THEY ARE ASKING ABOUT THE

02:27:46.090 --> 02:27:47.358
VACCINES THE READING THE

02:27:47.425 --> 02:27:48.693
NEWSPAPER THAT SAYS THERE'S-

02:27:48.759 --> 02:27:50.728
YOU KNOW 90% OF THEM STILL

02:27:50.795 --> 02:27:52.263

BUT OUR MEMBERS FEEL STRONGLY-

02:32:29.340 --> 02:32:31.175

EXPRESSED. THAT IN PERSON

02:32:34.078 --> 02:32:36.213

IN SCHOOLS WE THINK THAT'S

02:32:41.418 --> 02:32:43.621
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO GET

THEM BACK IN PERSON-

02:32:45.456 --> 02:32:47.424
DEVELOPMENTALLY- SOCIAL

EMOTIONALLY THAT IT IS- THAT

02:32:49.927 --> 02:32:53.330
THAT IS THE SUPERIOR METHOD OF-

02:32:53.397 --> 02:32:55.499
OF PROVIDING THIS SORT OF

02:32:55.566 --> 02:32:58.068
INSTRUCTION WE NEED TO PROVIDE.

02:32:58.135 --> 02:33:00.304
WE ALSO AGREE THAT HEALTH AND

02:33:00.371 --> 02:33:02.106
SAFETY HAS TO BE OUR TOP

02:33:02.172 --> 02:33:03.874
PRIORITY THAT HAS TO REMAIN OUR

02:33:03.941 --> 02:33:08.712

pOF STUDENTS AND STAFF ON SCHOOL

02:33:18.222 --> 02:33:21.425
CAMPUSES. HUMAN RESOURCES ARE

02:33:21.492 --> 02:33:23.694
CRITICAL TO ACHIEVING BOTH OF

02:33:23.761 --> 02:33:27.598
THOSE GOALS. AND UNFORTUNATELY

02:33:27.665 --> 02:33:30.801
DUE TO INEQUITIES THAT EXIST IN

02:33:30.868 --> 02:33:31.402
OUR WAY OUT PROTECTION LAWS IN

02:33:31.468 --> 02:33:34.271
THIS STATE. THOUSANDS OF

02:33:34.338 --> 02:33:36.507

WORK FOLKS MANY FOLKS WHOSE JOB

02:33:43.147 --> 02:33:45.082
IT IS TO KEEP STUDENTS SAFE.

02:33:45.149 --> 02:33:46.150
THE FOLKS WHOSE JOB IT IS TO

02:33:46.216 --> 02:33:47.885
PROVIDE THE ONE THE ONE

02:33:47.952 --> 02:33:49.753
INSTRUCTIONAL SUPPORTS THAT ARE

02:33:49.820 --> 02:33:52.356
NECESSARY. MANY OF THOSE FOLKS

02:33:52.423 --> 02:33:54.558
IN MANY PARTS OF OUR STATE HAVE

02:33:54.625 --> 02:33:57.261
BEEN LAID OFF. AND SO WE ARE

02:33:57.328 --> 02:33:59.029
CONCERNED ABOUT THE HUMAN

02:33:59.096 --> 02:34:01.865
CAPITAL NECESSARY TO MEET THE

02:34:01.932 --> 02:34:02.499

02:34:09.073 --> 02:34:12.643
THAT'S TRUE IN SOME PLACES-

02:34:12.710 --> 02:34:14.812
DISTRICTS ARE AHEAD OF THE GAME.

02:34:14.878 --> 02:34:16.313
BUT IN SOME PLACES DISTRICTS

02:34:16.380 --> 02:34:19.984
ARE FAR BEHIND. IN CERTAIN

02:34:20.050 --> 02:34:21.285
PLACES WHERE THEY HAVE LAID OFF

02:34:21.352 --> 02:34:23.354
EVERY PARA EDUCATOR IN AN

OUR STUDENTS ARE GOING TO HAVE

02:34:28.058 --> 02:34:30.294
WHEN THEY RETURN. TO IN PERSON

02:34:30.361 --> 02:34:31.862
INSTRUCTION TO GET THE ONE TO

02:34:31.929 --> 02:34:33.297
ONE SUPPORT THAT THEY HAVE BEEN

02:34:33.364 --> 02:34:34.531
LACKING THE ENTIRE TIME THEY'VE

02:34:34.598 --> 02:34:35.899
BEEN GONE IN DISTANCE LEARNING

02:34:35.966 --> 02:34:37.701
IN PLACES LIKE THAT. THE

02:34:37.768 --> 02:34:39.370
INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT IN PLACE

02:34:39.436 --> 02:34:41.372
THE NEEDS THE HUMAN CAPITAL

02:34:41.438 --> 02:34:43.407

THAN IT'S EVER BEEN. BECAUSE OF

02:36:58.609 --> 02:36:59.943
THE SITUATION WE'VE FACED OVER

02:37:00.010 --> 02:37:01.845

THEY NEED TO BE. NOW OBVIOUSLY

02:37:13.090 --> 02:37:14.324
HEALTH AND SAFETY AGAIN IS OUR

02:37:14.391 --> 02:37:16.960
TOP PRIORITY IN MAKING SURE

02:37:17.027 --> 02:37:18.796
THAT WE CAN GET TO THAT POINT.

02:37:18.862 --> 02:37:20.697
AND MANY OF US IN THIS MEETING

02:37:20.764 --> 02:37:22.299

02:37:22.366 --> 02:37:23.500

OF US WERE INVOLVED IN A TASK

02:37:33.844 --> 02:37:35.512
FORCE THAT MET TO DEVELOP A

02:37:35.579 --> 02:37:37.481
FRAMEWORK IN A CHECKLIST. TO

02:37:37.548 --> 02:37:38.816
MAKE SURE THAT SCHOOLS WERE

02:37:38.882 --> 02:37:40.651

WAS TO START THE SCHOOL YEAR

02:37:47.224 --> 02:37:50.194
WITH FOLKS IN PERSON. AND WE

02:37:50.260 --> 02:37:51.195
CREATED SOME CRITERIA WE

02:37:51.261 --> 02:37:52.229
CREATED A CHECKLIST THAT WE

02:37:52.296 --> 02:37:54.498
FELT. GIVEN THE CONDITIONS ON

02:37:54.565 --> 02:37:55.365
THE GROUND IN SCHOOLS ACROSS

THE STATE COULD BE IMPLEMENTED

02:37:57.267 --> 02:37:58.936
TO MAKE SCHOOLS. PLACES THAT

02:37:59.002 --> 02:38:00.704
WERE SAFE FOR STUDENTS AND

02:38:00.771 --> 02:38:06.343
STAFF. AND UNFORTUNATELY THIS

02:38:06.410 --> 02:38:07.978
STATE OF AFFAIRS IN TERMS OF

02:38:08.045 --> 02:38:09.513
THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS WAS

02:38:09.580 --> 02:38:10.848
MUCH WORSE THAN WE EXPECTED IT

02:38:10.914 --> 02:38:12.349
WOULD BE. IN AUGUST AND

02:38:12.416 --> 02:38:14.084
SEPTEMBER AND MOST SCHOOLS DID

02:38:14.151 --> 02:38:16.587
NOT REOPEN AT LEAST UNIVERSALLY

02:38:16.653 --> 02:38:19.223
FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. THIS

02:38:19.289 --> 02:38:20.958
SITUATION TODAY IS SO MUCH

02:38:21.024 --> 02:38:24.228
WORSE. IN NEARLY EVERY COUNTY

02:38:24.294 --> 02:38:26.129
IN THE STATE WHEN IT WAS IN

02:38:26.196 --> 02:38:28.298
AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER. THAT IT

02:38:28.365 --> 02:38:31.535
JUST IT SEEMS SORT OF OUT OF

02:38:31.602 --> 02:38:33.470
TOUCH WITH THE REALITY ON THE

02:38:33.537 --> 02:38:35.138
GROUND. TO BE HAVING A

SUBMIT PLANS BY TEN DAYS FROM

02:38:41.178 --> 02:38:43.814
NOW- WHEN THE REALITY ON THE

02:38:43.881 --> 02:38:45.515
GROUND IS SO MUCH WORSE THAN IT

02:38:45.582 --> 02:38:47.618
WAS LAST AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER.

02:38:47.684 --> 02:38:49.419

HUNDRED THOUSAND. AND SO IT

02:39:03.433 --> 02:39:04.568
IT'S NOT THAT WE DON'T THINK

02:39:04.635 --> 02:39:06.203

02:41:45.562 --> 02:41:47.164
SUBMITTED BY FEBRUARY FIRST.

02:41:47.230 --> 02:41:50.734
WILL GET LESS MONEY THAN THEY

02:41:50.801 --> 02:41:51.334
WILL GET IF THIS PROGRAM IS AN

02:41:51.401 --> 02:41:54.871
PASSED. SENATOR GLAZER- I THINK

02:41:54.938 --> 02:41:58.408
POINTED OUT WELL. THAT THERE

02:41:58.475 --> 02:41:58.975
ARE SOME SCHOOLS THAT AREN'T

02:41:59.042 --> 02:42:01.645
EVEN ELIGIBLE. THOSE SCHOOLS IF

02:42:01.711 --> 02:42:04.281
THIS PROGRAM BECOMES LAW WELL

02:42:04.347 --> 02:42:06.550
ACTUALLY GET LESS MONEY. THEN

02:42:06.616 --> 02:42:07.551
THEY WOULD GET IF THIS PROGRAM

02:42:07.617 --> 02:42:09.052
DOESN'T BECOME LAW BECAUSE IT'S

02:42:09.119 --> 02:42:09.886
NOT A PROBLEM NINETY EIGHT

02:42:09.953 --> 02:42:11.588
DOLLARS AND WE'RE JUST

02:42:11.655 --> 02:42:14.958
REARRANGING DECK CHAIRS. AND

02:42:15.025 --> 02:42:15.926
SO- DROP NINETY EIGHT IS NOT

02:42:15.992 --> 02:42:17.661
THE APPROPRIATE REVENUE SOURCE

02:42:17.727 --> 02:42:18.462
FOR THIS OR NOT THE APPROPRIATE

02:42:18.528 --> 02:42:20.464
FUNDING SOURCE. FOR THIS

02:42:20.530 --> 02:42:21.832
PROGRAM IF WE'RE GONNA TALK

02:42:21.898 --> 02:42:22.699
ABOUT THIS LET'S TALK ABOUT THE

02:42:22.766 --> 02:42:25.202
USE OF. A DOLLARS BEYOND PROP

02:42:25.268 --> 02:42:26.937
NINETY OR FEDERAL DOLLARS. AND

02:42:27.003 --> 02:42:27.804
YOU KNOW LIKE MISTER BREYER

02:42:27.871 --> 02:42:32.676
SAID- THE FACT IS THAT GIVEN

02:42:32.742 --> 02:42:34.945
THE COST OF TESTING THESE FUNDS

02:42:35.011 --> 02:42:38.715
WILL BE SPENT MOSTLY ON BACK.

02:42:38.782 --> 02:42:41.384
LINE ITEM OF TESTING. SO JUST

02:42:41.451 --> 02:42:42.853
ADDING TO THE POINT OF THE FACT

02:42:42.919 --> 02:42:44.754
THAT THIS MONEY THAT IS MEANT

02:42:44.821 --> 02:42:46.289
FOR INSTRUCTIONAL PURPOSES

02:42:46.356 --> 02:42:48.358
SHOULD REMAIN AND CONTINUE TO

02:42:48.425 --> 02:42:49.826
BE SPENT FOR THAT PURPOSE LET'S

02:42:49.893 --> 02:42:52.095
ALLOCATE DOLLARS LET'S NOT TAKE

02:42:52.162 --> 02:42:53.830
AWAY FROM THE NEEDS OF OUR

02:42:53.897 --> 02:42:54.831
STUDENTS IN TERMS OF

02:42:54.898 --> 02:42:56.600
INSTRUCTION TO MEET THE NEEDS

02:42:56.666 --> 02:42:57.701
OF OUR STUDENTS AND OUR STAFF

02:42:57.767 --> 02:42:59.136
IN TERMS OF HEALTH AND SAFETY

LET'S MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR

02:43:00.303 --> 02:43:01.404
STUDENTS AND STAFF IN TERMS OF

02:43:01.471 --> 02:43:03.406
HEALTH AND SAFETY BUT NOT

02:43:03.473 --> 02:43:05.408
USING. INSTRUCTIONAL DOLLARS. I

02:43:05.475 --> 02:43:07.144
THINK A LOT OF FOLKS HAVE

02:43:07.210 --> 02:43:07.711
MENTIONED THAT THE TIMING IS

02:43:07.777 --> 02:43:10.714
UNREALISTIC- AS I SAID ABOUT

02:43:10.780 --> 02:43:11.515
EXPECT YOU KNOW CENTER CORTESE

02:43:11.581 --> 02:43:13.783
THINK HIGHLIGHTED WELL HOW THE

02:43:13.850 --> 02:43:15.719
EXPECTATION SETTING IS SORT OF

02:43:15.785 --> 02:43:17.721
OUT OF WHACK WITH THE REALITY

02:43:17.787 --> 02:43:20.724
ON THE GROUND. THIS CHECKLIST

02:43:20.790 --> 02:43:24.161
JUST CAME OUT LAST THURSDAY.

02:43:24.227 --> 02:43:26.663
WHICH MEANS ALLEY AS ONLY KNOWN

02:43:26.730 --> 02:43:28.632
WHAT THEY NEEDED TO INCLUDE IN

02:43:28.698 --> 02:43:33.904
THEIR COVERT SAFETY.

02:43:33.970 --> 02:43:36.273

THAT PLAN WITH THEIR- EMPLOYEES.

02:43:44.481 --> 02:43:45.982
TO HAVE THAT RATIFIED BY THOSE

02:43:46.049 --> 02:43:47.817
EMPLOYEE UNITS TO SUBMIT THAT

02:43:47.884 --> 02:43:50.654
PLAN TO THE STATE. ALL OF THAT

02:43:50.720 --> 02:43:52.822
WITHIN THE NEXT TEN DAYS. IT'S

02:43:52.889 --> 02:43:56.026
UNREALISTIC AND THERE'S JUST NO

02:43:56.092 --> 02:43:58.461
POINT IN RUSHING TO CREATE

02:43:58.528 --> 02:44:00.430
THESE PLANS ALL THE SUDDEN WHEN

02:44:00.497 --> 02:44:06.136
THIS BILL IS NOT EVEN YET ALL.

02:44:06.203 --> 02:44:11.341
TO ANSWER- THE CHAIRWOMAN'S

02:44:11.408 --> 02:44:15.478

OF THOSE DISTRICTS HAVE THOSE

02:44:30.961 --> 02:44:33.263
PLANS RATIFIED I THINK THE

02:44:33.330 --> 02:44:34.698
THOSE ANSWERS TO THE CHURCH

02:44:34.764 --> 02:44:37.901
QUSTIONS DEMONSTRATE THAT THIS

02:44:37.968 --> 02:44:38.468
PLAN IS NOT READY FOR PRIME

02:44:38.535 --> 02:44:41.438
TIME. NOW TO BE CLEAR I

THE SAFE SCHOOLS FOR ALL

02:44:47.644 --> 02:44:49.079
PLANNED THE BROADER PLAN NOT

02:44:49.145 --> 02:44:50.447
JUST THIS IN PERSON INSTRUCTION

02:44:50.513 --> 02:44:52.315
GRANT PROGRAM WE APPRECIATE THE

02:44:52.382 --> 02:44:54.551
DEFINITIONAL CLARITY THAT CDPH

02:44:54.618 --> 02:44:56.486
HAS. PUT IN THIS CONSOLIDATED

02:44:56.553 --> 02:44:57.787
GUIDANCE WHICH AGAIN IS

02:44:57.854 --> 02:44:59.723
SEPARATE AND DISTINCT FROM THIS

02:44:59.789 --> 02:45:02.792
GRANT PROGRAM WE APPRECIATE THE-

02:45:02.859 --> 02:45:04.961
THIS REVELATION OR REALIZE

02:45:05.028 --> 02:45:06.529
ATION BUT YOUNG KIDS ARE

02:45:06.596 --> 02:45:07.697
ACTUALLY BETTER WEARING MASKS

02:45:07.764 --> 02:45:09.332
THAT WE THOUGHT THEY WERE. IN

02:45:09.399 --> 02:45:10.700
FACT IN MANY CASES ARE BETTER

02:45:10.767 --> 02:45:11.668
AT DOING IT THAN ADULTS ARE

02:45:11.735 --> 02:45:13.503
BECAUSE- THEY'RE THE WAY THEIR

02:45:13.570 --> 02:45:14.571
BRAINS WORK THIS LEARNED

02:45:14.638 --> 02:45:18.475
BEHAVIOR HABIT FORMING IS MUCH

02:45:18.541 --> 02:45:19.009
EASIER FOR THAN IT IS FOR

02:45:19.075 --> 02:45:19.843
ADULTS. WE APPRECIATE THE

02:45:19.909 --> 02:45:21.044
RECOGNITION OF THE NEEDS TO

02:45:21.111 --> 02:45:22.345
MAKE SURE THAT THE PP IS

02:45:22.412 --> 02:45:23.613
AVAILABLE TO THE STAFF THE

02:45:23.680 --> 02:45:25.815
TESTING IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT

02:45:25.882 --> 02:45:28.451
INCLUDING SURVEILLANCE TESTING.

02:45:28.518 --> 02:45:30.020
BUT WE'RE DISAPPOINTED THAT THE

02:45:30.086 --> 02:45:31.288
WORD VACCINE DOES NOT EVEN

02:45:31.354 --> 02:45:33.290
APPEAR. IN THE TRAILER BILL

02:45:33.356 --> 02:45:36.426
LANGUAGE. SO IT'S ONE THING TO

02:45:36.493 --> 02:45:37.927
SAY THAT WE'RE NOT RECOGNIZING

02:45:37.994 --> 02:45:39.329
THE IMPORTANCE OF VACCINES OR

02:45:39.396 --> 02:45:40.964
HIGHLIGHTING IT SIGNIFICANTLY

02:45:41.031 --> 02:45:44.100
THE WORD VACCINE OR VACCINATION

02:45:44.167 --> 02:45:44.668
DOES NOT EVEN APPEAR IN THE

02:45:44.734 --> 02:45:47.237
TRAILER BILL. AND I THINK

02:45:47.304 --> 02:45:49.939
THAT'S IMPORTANT- AND I WANT TO

02:45:50.006 --> 02:45:50.707
HIGHLIGHT FOR THOSE WHO DIDN'T

02:45:50.774 --> 02:45:52.642

SOUND SEEMS TO BE ARE LARGELY

02:45:56.313 --> 02:45:59.049
IN AGREEMENT. THAT VACCINES

02:45:59.115 --> 02:45:59.549
HAVE TO BE PART OF THIS

02:45:59.616 --> 02:46:01.651
DISCUSSION. AND SO I REALLY

02:46:01.718 --> 02:46:03.386
APPRECIATE OUR COLLEAGUES AND

02:46:03.453 --> 02:46:05.422
MANAGEMENT WHO HAVE RECOGNIZED

02:46:05.488 --> 02:46:07.290

IN THE CONVERSATION WE ALSO

02:46:08.458 --> 02:46:09.926
HAVE TO RECOGNIZE OURS WE I

02:46:09.993 --> 02:46:10.627
THINK WE ALL KNOW THIS OUR

02:46:10.694 --> 02:46:13.396
STATE IS BEHIND IN VACCINATIONS

02:46:13.463 --> 02:46:14.564
WE ARE BEHIND IN DISTRIBUTIONS

02:46:14.631 --> 02:46:16.166
OF THE VACCINE I HAVE MANY

02:46:16.232 --> 02:46:19.803
COLLEAGUES WHO I. SERVED WITH-

02:46:19.869 --> 02:46:20.603
FOUR WHEN I WAS AN EDUCATOR AND

APPOINTMENT FOR THEIR SECOND

02:46:29.779 --> 02:46:32.515

02:46:32.582 --> 02:46:34.117
TO GET VACCINE DISTRIBUTION

02:46:34.184 --> 02:46:36.119

WITH OUR MANAGEMENT PARTNERS

02:52:08.251 --> 02:52:09.986
HOPE THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL

02:52:10.053 --> 02:52:12.088
PARTNER WITH US TO DO THAT. THE

02:52:12.155 --> 02:52:13.022

IDEA OF A PHASED IN APPROACH

02:52:46.589 --> 02:52:48.124

PHASED IN APPROACH AND WE

02:52:53.596 --> 02:52:55.832
SUPPORT THAT IDEA AS WELL. AS

02:52:55.898 --> 02:52:57.800
FAR AS UNIFORM STANDARDS WE

02:52:57.867 --> 02:52:59.268
APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION'S

WILL MAKE OUR SCHOOL STAY FOR.

02:53:06.843 --> 02:53:08.211
THE PROPOSED SAP PROVIDES

02:53:08.277 --> 02:53:09.979

RECEIVING SAP INCENTIVE

02:53:15.017 --> 02:53:17.186

APPLYING FOR THE DIVISIONAL

02:53:19.889 --> 02:53:21.958
DOLLARS. WE BELIEVE THAT ALL

02:53:22.024 --> 02:53:23.693
SCHOOLS NEED RESOURCES FOR

02:53:23.760 --> 02:53:27.063
STUDENT TESTING. AND STAFF.

02:53:27.130 --> 02:53:28.831

02:53:28.898 --> 02:53:29.866
THAT SHOULD BE QUICK BE

HEALTH EQUITY INDEX. FOR

02:53:36.606 --> 02:53:37.273
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING WE

02:53:37.340 --> 02:53:38.708
APPRECIATE THAT THE SAP

02:53:38.775 --> 02:53:39.742
REQUIRES COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

02:53:39.809 --> 02:53:41.077
AS A CONDITION OF RECEIVING THE

02:53:41.144 --> 02:53:42.645
INCENTIVE GRANT FUNDING.

02:53:42.712 --> 02:53:43.980
HOWEVER WE ARE CONCERNED THAT

02:53:44.046 --> 02:53:46.015
THE SAP COULD CREATE CONFUSION

02:53:46.082 --> 02:53:47.150
AND CAUSE ELEAZAR TO IGNORE

02:53:47.216 --> 02:53:48.985
SAFETY WHEN REOPENING SCHOOLS

02:53:49.051 --> 02:53:50.686
IF THEY CHOOSE NOT TO APPLY FOR

02:53:50.753 --> 02:53:53.990
THE GRANT FUNDING. RESOURCES WE

02:53:54.056 --> 02:53:55.558
APPRECIATE THE SAP PROVIDES

02:53:55.625 --> 02:53:57.293
DOLLARS PER STUDENT FOR A RE

OPENING AND SUPPLEMENTAL

02:53:58.094 --> 02:53:59.762
STUDENT SUPPORTS. HOWEVER WE

02:53:59.829 --> 02:54:01.230
BELIEVE THAT ALL SCHOOLS NEED

02:54:01.297 --> 02:54:03.166
RESOURCES WHEN THEY CAN SAFELY

02:54:03.232 --> 02:54:04.233
RE OPEN FOR IN PERSON

FAMILIES WHO CHOOSE TO REMAIN

02:54:09.005 --> 02:54:11.474
IN DISTANCE LEARNING. WE KNOW

02:54:11.541 --> 02:54:12.775
THAT FEDERAL DOLLARS WILL BE

02:54:12.842 --> 02:54:14.544
COMING TO THE STATE SHORTLY

02:54:14.610 --> 02:54:16.779
THAT WILL DIRECTLY FUND COBIT

02:54:16.846 --> 02:54:19.081
MITIGATION STRATEGIES. WE WOULD

02:54:19.148 --> 02:54:20.550
WANT THE STATE TO USE THOSE

02:54:20.616 --> 02:54:22.819
FEDERAL DOLLARS BEFORE USING

02:54:22.885 --> 02:54:25.188
PROP NINETY EIGHT DOLLARS.

02:54:25.254 --> 02:54:27.323
HOWEVER THE STEP THE SAP FALL

02:54:27.390 --> 02:54:29.292
SHORT IN SOME VERY IMPORTANT

02:54:29.358 --> 02:54:31.794
WAYS. THE SAP ENCOURAGES RE

02:54:31.861 --> 02:54:33.462
OPENING FOR IN PERSON

02:54:33.529 --> 02:54:35.431

02:54:35.498 --> 02:54:38.501
I SAY DEAR AND I DARE SAY THE

02:54:38.568 --> 02:54:40.503
DEEP PURPLE TEAR. THIS IS WHERE

02:54:40.570 --> 02:54:42.171
THE LEGISLATURE CAN LEND THEIR

02:54:42.238 --> 02:54:43.840
VOICE TO HELP IMPROVE THE

02:54:43.906 --> 02:54:46.609
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. THE

02:54:46.676 --> 02:54:48.678
PURPOSE HERE IS NOT SAFE. THE

02:54:48.744 --> 02:54:50.580
SAP ALLOWS FOR SCHOOLS REOPEN

02:54:50.646 --> 02:54:51.914
IF THEY'RE BELOW TWENTY FIVE

02:54:51.981 --> 02:54:53.850
CASES PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:54:53.916 --> 02:54:57.620

GUIDANCE FROM LAST SUMMER

02:54:58.788 --> 02:55:00.022
INDICATED THAT ELEMENTARY

02:55:00.089 --> 02:55:01.657
WAIVER SHOULD NOT BE GRANTED IF

02:55:01.724 --> 02:55:03.059
THE COUNTY WAS AT AT AT A

FOURTEEN CASES PER ONE HUNDRED

02:55:06.896 --> 02:55:08.331
THOUSAND. WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT

02:55:08.397 --> 02:55:10.600
IS SAFE TO REOPEN IN PERSON FOR

02:55:10.666 --> 02:55:12.268
IN FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION IN

02:55:12.335 --> 02:55:14.103
THE PURPLE TEAR. THE

CENSUS TRACTS COMPARED TO THE

02:55:24.680 --> 02:55:26.983
IMPROVED IF THE HEALTH EQUITY

02:55:27.049 --> 02:55:28.918
METRICS WERE INTEGRATED AS A

REACHING OUT FOR COMMENT. WE

02:58:12.515 --> 02:58:13.916
GUIDANCE THAT IS COME OUT THAT

02:58:13.983 --> 02:58:16.085
POINTS OUT SOME- ISSUES THAT

02:58:16.152 --> 02:58:17.520
WILL SHARE WITH THE MEMBERS OF

02:58:17.586 --> 02:58:19.288
THE COMMITTEE AS WELL. STEW IS

02:58:19.355 --> 02:58:20.790
NOT TO BELABOR SOME OF THOSE

02:58:20.856 --> 02:58:23.592
POINTS- AT THIS HOUR. BUT WE DO

02:58:23.659 --> 02:58:25.961
WANT BATTERIES THAT. WE MUST

02:58:26.028 --> 02:58:27.229
HAVE A PLAN FOR IN PERSON

02:58:27.296 --> 02:58:28.164
INSTRUCTION THAT WORKS IN

02:58:28.230 --> 02:58:29.799
CONJUNCTION WITH VACCINE

02:58:29.865 --> 02:58:32.234
AVAILABILITY- AT A POINT WHERE

02:58:32.301 --> 02:58:34.270
CASE RATES ARE AT A SAFE ZONE

02:58:34.336 --> 02:58:35.938
AND WHEN ALSO IN CONJUNCTION

02:58:36.005 --> 02:58:38.074
WITH ICE YOU. CAPACITY WHICH

02:58:38.140 --> 02:58:39.575
SEEMS TO NOT NECESSARILY BE IN

02:58:39.642 --> 02:58:43.345
EVERY. OR BE A PART OF EVERY

02:58:43.412 --> 02:58:44.146
QUESTION. MAYBE MANY OF OUR

02:58:44.213 --> 02:58:46.949
MEMBERS. DESPERATELY YOU WANT

02:58:47.016 --> 02:58:48.384
TO BE BACK IN THEIR CLASSROOMS

02:58:48.451 --> 02:58:50.453
THEY MISTER STUDENTS. WE'RE

02:58:50.519 --> 02:58:51.821
JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW

02:58:51.887 --> 02:58:54.256
TO MAKE IT A SAFE RETURN. AND

02:58:54.323 --> 02:58:55.758
SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN OPENED WE

02:58:55.825 --> 02:58:56.892
THINK THAT THERE HAVE BEEN

02:58:56.959 --> 02:58:58.794
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF. OF

02:58:58.861 --> 02:59:00.196
EDUCATORS AND STAFF AND

02:59:00.262 --> 02:59:01.697
ADMINISTRATORS AND SO FORTH

02:59:01.764 --> 02:59:03.766
THAT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO HOLD

02:59:03.833 --> 02:59:05.568
THE SHIP TOGETHER HERE AND WE

02:59:05.634 --> 02:59:06.335
REALLY RESPECT THE WRK THAT

02:59:06.402 --> 02:59:08.237
HAS GONE ON. AND YOU TO

02:59:08.304 --> 02:59:09.705
RECOGNIZE THAT WE ALL WANT TO

02:59:09.772 --> 02:59:13.442
GET BACK TO IN PERSON AS FAST.

02:59:13.509 --> 02:59:14.777
TO DO THAT WE DO HAVE

02:59:14.844 --> 02:59:16.579
CRITICISMS OF SOME OF THE-

02:59:16.645 --> 02:59:18.147
BROAD STROKES THAT THE GUIDANCE

02:59:18.214 --> 02:59:20.116
IS HAS ALWAYS HAD A PART OF IT

02:59:20.182 --> 02:59:21.750
SINCE AS DAVID MENTIONED WE

02:59:21.817 --> 02:59:23.652
WERE IN THESE TALKS LAST APRIL

02:59:23.719 --> 02:59:26.589
OR MARCH. ALL THE FLEXIBILITY

02:59:26.655 --> 02:59:28.524
REQUIRED TO REALLY TARGET THE

02:59:28.591 --> 02:59:30.993
NEEDS. IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS

02:59:31.060 --> 02:59:33.929
TO BE. CONGRUENT WITH SCIENCE

02:59:33.996 --> 02:59:35.998
AND BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SCHOOL

02:59:36.065 --> 02:59:37.833
SITE BY SCHOOL SITES. A

02:59:37.900 --> 02:59:39.668
REALISTIC PLAN TO BE ABLE TO

02:59:39.735 --> 02:59:41.804
BRING IN THE STUDENTS WITH THE

02:59:41.871 --> 02:59:44.140
HIGHEST NEEDS FIRST. WE AGREED

02:59:44.206 --> 02:59:46.475
THAT. SUPER BOWL AND ALL THE

02:59:46.542 --> 02:59:48.010
OTHER NAMES FOR IT SEEMS TO BE

02:59:48.077 --> 02:59:50.212
A RIDICULOUS TIME TO TALK ABOUT

02:59:50.279 --> 02:59:50.679
RETURNING TO IN PERSON

02:59:50.746 --> 02:59:53.382
INSTRUCTION. OF PACKING FOLKS

02:59:53.449 --> 02:59:56.252
INDOORS REALLY TAKES DILIGENCE-

02:59:56.318 --> 02:59:58.254
RIGHT NOW IT'S DANGEROUS TO DO

02:59:58.320 --> 03:00:02.691
THIS AND WE DO TAKE SOME. ISSUE

03:00:02.758 --> 03:00:05.161
WITH THE RESEARCH THAT IS OUT

03:00:05.227 --> 03:00:05.995
THERE AND THAT IS BEING RELIED

03:00:06.061 --> 03:00:08.063
ON. HOW WE THINK THAT THERE ARE

03:00:08.130 --> 03:00:09.532
STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT CHILDREN

03:00:09.598 --> 03:00:10.966
CAN BE A SYMPTOMATIC SUPER

03:00:11.033 --> 03:00:13.802
SPREADERS. AND WE ALSO NOTICE

03:00:13.869 --> 03:00:16.038
THAT THE CDC IS NOTICING THAT.

03:00:16.105 --> 03:00:17.673
INFECTION RATES ON FOR CHILDREN

03:00:17.740 --> 03:00:19.875
ARE ON THE RISE. WE ALSO LOOK

03:00:19.942 --> 03:00:20.843
AT SOME OF THE NATIONAL

03:00:20.910 --> 03:00:22.311
DASHBOARDS AND TAKE NOTE THAT

03:00:22.378 --> 03:00:24.046
TEACHERS IN NEW YORK AND IN

03:00:24.113 --> 03:00:26.315
TEXAS WHERE THEY HAVE RETURNED

03:00:26.382 --> 03:00:28.184
IN PERSON. HAVE A HIGHER

03:00:28.250 --> 03:00:29.585
INFECTION RATE THAN THE GENERAL

03:00:29.652 --> 03:00:31.453
POPULATION AT ONE POINT THIS

03:00:31.520 --> 03:00:32.755
STATE WAS LOOKED TO AS A

03:00:32.821 --> 03:00:34.456
RATIONALE FOR OPENING SCHOOLS

03:00:34.523 --> 03:00:37.026
BECAUSE- WE'RE NOT. HAVING A

03:00:37.092 --> 03:00:38.460
MORE DANGEROUS ENVIRONMENT IN

03:00:38.527 --> 03:00:40.062
SCHOOLS WERE JUST TESTING THEIR

03:00:40.129 --> 03:00:41.163
MORE SO OF COURSE WE SEE IT

03:00:41.230 --> 03:00:43.065
MORE. BUT NOW THAT TEACHERS ARE

03:00:43.132 --> 03:00:44.366
BECOMING INFECTED IN THOSE

03:00:44.433 --> 03:00:45.334
AREAS AT A HIGHER RATE THAN

03:00:45.401 --> 03:00:46.769
GENERAL POPULATION THAT'S A

03:00:46.835 --> 03:00:48.871
SIGNAL TO US THAT- IN PERSON

03:00:48.938 --> 03:00:50.873
INSTRUCTION AT A TIME LIKE THIS

03:00:50.940 --> 03:00:52.474
IS NOT THE MOST PRUDENT AND

03:00:52.541 --> 03:00:55.878
SAFE CHOICE. THIS IS NOT JUST

03:00:55.945 --> 03:00:57.846
ABOUT SCHOOLS TO NZXT'S

03:00:57.913 --> 03:00:59.281
POSITION WE WANT TO BE CLEAR

03:00:59.348 --> 03:01:00.883
THIS IS BROADER THAN JUST

03:01:00.950 --> 03:01:04.753
SAFELY RE OPENING IN PERSON

03:01:04.820 --> 03:01:06.822
STEMMING AND FLATTENING THIS

03:01:06.889 --> 03:01:08.057
CURVE THAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO

03:01:08.123 --> 03:01:09.959
DO. FOR THE BETTER PART OF A

03:01:10.025 --> 03:01:11.627
YEAR NOW. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT

03:01:11.694 --> 03:01:13.529
META ANALYSIS OF WHAT CAN BE

03:01:13.596 --> 03:01:15.264
THE BEST TOOL IN FLATTENING

03:01:15.331 --> 03:01:17.900
CURVES. KEEPING STUFF FOLKS OUT

03:01:17.967 --> 03:01:19.768
OF SCHOOLS IS THE NUMBER TWO

03:01:19.835 --> 03:01:22.271
MOST. EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE

03:01:22.338 --> 03:01:24.707
WAY TO DO THAT. AND SO IT SEEMS

03:01:24.773 --> 03:01:26.108
THAT THERE IS SOME DISCREPANCY

03:01:26.175 --> 03:01:28.244
IN HE SCIENCE WHICH- I'M NOT A

03:01:28.310 --> 03:01:29.645
SCIENCE TEACHER BUT IT SEEMS

03:01:29.712 --> 03:01:31.280
THAT IF THERE'S QUESTIONS PER

03:01:31.347 --> 03:01:32.715
THE SCIENTIFIC MODEL IT'S AN

03:01:32.781 --> 03:01:34.316
UNSETTLED QUESTION AND WE STILL

03:01:34.383 --> 03:01:35.784
NEED TO FIND ANSWERS TO THESE

03:01:35.851 --> 03:01:36.685
QUESTIONS BEFORE WE MOVE

03:01:36.752 --> 03:01:39.288
FORWARD. REALLY AGREE WITH THE-

03:01:39.355 --> 03:01:41.557
CALLS FOR A MORE EQUITABLE WAY

03:01:41.624 --> 03:01:43.225
TO SPEND THESE DOLLARS. WE

03:01:43.292 --> 03:01:44.660
THINK WE SHOULD BE TARGETED TO

03:01:44.727 --> 03:01:45.828
THOSE STUDENTS WHO ARE IN THE

03:01:45.894 --> 03:01:47.229
GREATEST NEED AND HAVE

03:01:47.296 --> 03:01:48.731
INTERVENTION SERVICES RATHER

03:01:48.797 --> 03:01:50.432
THAN BROAD GRANTS THAT. HELP

03:01:50.499 --> 03:01:52.201
SOME DISTRICTS AND PUT OTHERS

03:01:52.268 --> 03:01:55.070
AT ADISADVANTAGE. WE REALLY

03:01:55.137 --> 03:01:57.539
APPRECIATE HEARING FROM OUR

03:01:57.606 --> 03:01:58.474
PARTNERS IN MANAGEMENT TODAY

03:01:58.540 --> 03:02:01.143
THAT- SUPPORT THE FIVE POINT%

03:02:01.210 --> 03:02:02.278
THREE BILLION IN SUPPORT FOR

03:02:02.344 --> 03:02:04.013
INTERVENTIONS AND TO GROW THIS

03:02:04.079 --> 03:02:05.114
AMOUNT AND I THINK WE AGREE

03:02:05.180 --> 03:02:06.482
WITH THAT. RATHER THAN THESE

03:02:06.548 --> 03:02:08.550
INCENTIVE GRANTS TO RUSH PEOPLE

03:02:08.617 --> 03:02:10.319
BACK IN. LET'S CONTINUE TO

03:02:10.386 --> 03:02:12.121
FOCUS ON THE STUDENTS WHO NEED

03:02:12.187 --> 03:02:13.722
HELP THE MOST. AND ALONG THOSE

03:02:13.789 --> 03:02:15.758
LINES WE'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT

03:02:15.824 --> 03:02:18.060
THE FACT THAT WE SHOULD BE.

03:02:18.127 --> 03:02:19.495
FOCUSING A LOT OF ATTENTION ON

03:02:19.561 --> 03:02:22.264
EMOTIONAL SUPPORT. THEM THERE

03:02:22.331 --> 03:02:24.433
IS A- LARGE CONCERN FROM

03:02:24.500 --> 03:02:26.201
PARENTS AND MANY OF OUR MEMBERS

03:02:26.268 --> 03:02:27.836
OF COURSE ARE ALSO PARENTS

03:02:27.903 --> 03:02:28.570
STRUGGLING WITH THE SAME

03:02:28.637 --> 03:02:30.739
ISSUES. AND THAT THERE IS

03:02:30.806 --> 03:02:32.574
CONCERN ABOUT LEARNING LOSS.

03:02:32.641 --> 03:02:34.743
AND I THINK SOMEONE SAID IT

03:02:34.810 --> 03:02:36.011
PERFECTLY IT'S NOT LEARNING

03:02:36.078 --> 03:02:37.813
LOSS IT'S JUST WE'RE STUMBLING

03:02:37.880 --> 03:02:40.916
THROUGH A DELAY. D. THE

03:02:40.983 --> 03:02:42.484
EMOTIONAL SUPPORT THAT CAN HELP

03:02:42.551 --> 03:02:44.653
FOLKS THAT WHEN STUDENTS DON'T

03:02:44.720 --> 03:02:47.323
HAVE A GOOD EMOTIONAL BECAUSE

03:02:47.389 --> 03:02:48.824
THE ENVIRONMENT THAT IMPACTS

03:02:48.891 --> 03:02:50.492
THEIR ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE. SO

03:02:50.559 --> 03:02:51.593
MAYBE IT'S NOT THAT THE

03:02:51.660 --> 03:02:55.230
TEACHING ISN'T BEING DONE. TO

03:02:55.297 --> 03:02:55.864
THEM I MEAN OBVIOUSLY IN PERSON

03:02:55.931 --> 03:02:56.498
IS THE MOST OF ACTIVE. BUT THAT

03:02:56.565 --> 03:02:57.700
THERE ARE SOME OTHER HERE.

03:02:57.766 --> 03:03:00.102
INTERNATIONAL IN A HISTORICALLY

03:03:00.169 --> 03:03:01.537
UNSAFE TIME FOR US TO BE

03:03:01.603 --> 03:03:02.905
LIVING. ON THAT WOULD BE

03:03:02.971 --> 03:03:04.740
IMPACTING STUDENTS PERFORMANCES

03:03:04.807 --> 03:03:06.141
AS WELL AND WE NEED TO LOOK AT

03:03:06.208 --> 03:03:07.476
THE WHOLE CHILD. WHOLE

03:03:07.543 --> 03:03:09.578
STUDENTS. AND NOT JUST WHETHER

03:03:09.645 --> 03:03:10.946
OR NOT THEY'RE IN THE CLASSROOM

03:03:11.013 --> 03:03:13.282
THERE'S MORE TO IT. LASTLY I

03:03:13.349 --> 03:03:15.117
JUST WANTED TO MENTION IT WAS

03:03:15.184 --> 03:03:17.286
SAID EARLIER THAT- DISTRICTS

03:03:17.353 --> 03:03:19.188
AND LOCALS WOULD BAD ALREADY

03:03:19.254 --> 03:03:20.522
HAVE CBA'S COLLECTIVE

03:03:20.589 --> 03:03:22.224
BARGAINING AGREEMENTS. AND WHO

03:03:22.291 --> 03:03:23.592
ARE ALREADY OPERATING IN SOME

03:03:23.659 --> 03:03:25.227
FASHION WITH STUDENTS IN

03:03:25.294 --> 03:03:28.263
CLASSROOMS. I MEAN I NEED TO.

03:03:28.330 --> 03:03:30.466
RE OPEN THAT. THE COLLECTIVE

03:03:30.532 --> 03:03:31.900
BARGAINING AGREEMENT AND I

03:03:31.967 --> 03:03:35.104
WOULD JUST CAUTION- TO SAY THAT.

03:03:35.170 --> 03:03:36.972
IS THERE MIGHT BE CBA'S THAT

03:03:37.039 --> 03:03:39.908
WERE AGREED TO PRIOR TO

03:03:39.975 --> 03:03:41.577
KNOWLEDGE AND ALSO HAVING THE

03:03:41.643 --> 03:03:42.878
FORESIGHT TO KNOW THAT THESE

03:03:42.945 --> 03:03:44.079
INCENTIVE GRANTS MIGHT BE ON

03:03:44.146 --> 03:03:45.914
THE HORIZON OR WHAT PLANS MAY

03:03:45.981 --> 03:03:47.850
OR MAY NOT BE. AND SO THOSE

03:03:47.916 --> 03:03:50.486
THOSE AGREEMENTS- MAYBE STALE

03:03:50.552 --> 03:03:52.921
IN THE CAR INTO AND WHAT WE'RE

03:03:52.988 --> 03:03:53.922
HAVING TO DEAL WITH RIGHT NOW

03:03:53.989 --> 03:03:56.225
AND- WE BELIEVE THAT IF WORKING

03:03:56.291 --> 03:03:57.726
CONDITIONS DRASTICALLY CHANGE

03:03:57.793 --> 03:04:00.329
YOU DO NEED TO RETURN TO THE

03:04:00.396 --> 03:04:00.963
TABLE TO TALK ABOUT THE IMPACTS

03:04:01.029 --> 03:04:04.032
OF THOSE. SO GIVEN THE OUR AND

03:04:04.099 --> 03:04:06.135
I KNOW THAT. THE DEPARTMENT OF

03:04:06.201 --> 03:04:07.569

MORE TIME- OUR- SCHOOLS ARE

A COUPLE IMPORTANT THINGS- THE

03:07:40.949 --> 03:07:44.052
DATA I REALLY APPRECIATED THAT

03:07:44.119 --> 03:07:45.954
THE AND I READ CAREFULLY THE-

03:07:46.021 --> 03:07:48.757
RESPONSE FROM C. F. T. R. ABOUT

03:07:48.824 --> 03:07:51.560
THAT THE DAY THAT WE CHOSEN-

03:07:51.627 --> 03:07:53.161
THAT THAT WORKS ARE PRESENTING

03:07:53.228 --> 03:07:55.731
AS THE AS THE CASE AND I WOULD

03:07:55.797 --> 03:07:57.966
SAY THAT- IT'S EXTREMELY-

03:07:58.033 --> 03:07:58.900
THERE'S A LOT OF DATA OUT

03:07:58.967 --> 03:08:02.704
THERE- THE DATA WE USED AS A

03:08:02.771 --> 03:08:04.740
RATIONALE FOR THAT- TWENTY FIVE

03:08:04.806 --> 03:08:06.274
PER HUNDRED THOUSAND. IS BASED

03:08:06.341 --> 03:08:08.877
ON- HARVARD GLOBAL HEALTH-

03:08:08.944 --> 03:08:11.446
GROUP RECOMMENDATIONS AS WELL

03:08:11.513 --> 03:08:12.581
AS A PRETTY RECENT ARTICLE OUT

03:08:12.648 --> 03:08:14.783
OF- PEDIATRICS WHICH IS A ONE

03:08:14.850 --> 03:08:16.451
OF THE HIGHEST IMPACT-

03:08:16.518 --> 03:08:18.487
PUBLICATIONS AND THE FIELD I'M

03:08:18.553 --> 03:08:20.889
LOOKING AT. SCHOOLS IN NORTH

03:08:20.956 --> 03:08:22.991
CAROLINA THAT HAD A HIGHEST

03:08:23.058 --> 03:08:27.429
CASE RATE ABOUT. TWENTY NINE

03:08:27.496 --> 03:08:29.865
PER HUNDRED THOUSAND PER DAY-

03:08:29.931 --> 03:08:30.999
THAT SHOULD THERE'S VERY IF YOU

03:08:31.066 --> 03:08:31.767
THE RIGHT MEDICATION STRATEGY

03:08:31.833 --> 03:08:33.669
IN PLACE AND ACTUALLY FOCUSED

03:08:33.735 --> 03:08:35.470
ON- MASKING AND JUST WILL

03:08:35.537 --> 03:08:38.306
DISTANCING- AND HAND WASHING IF

03:08:38.373 --> 03:08:39.841
THOSE ARE PLACES THAT YOU THEY

03:08:39.908 --> 03:08:41.543
HAD VERY VERY FEW OUTBREAKS

03:08:41.610 --> 03:08:43.478
THEY HAD LIKE I FORGET IT'S IN

03:08:43.545 --> 03:08:45.681
SINGLE DIGITS THE NUMBERS OF

03:08:45.747 --> 03:08:47.349
TRANSMISSIONS AND THAT IT ON A

03:08:47.416 --> 03:08:50.986
SCHOOL SETTING. AND THEY HAD-

03:08:51.053 --> 03:08:52.954
BUT NO CHILD TO STAFF

03:08:53.021 --> 03:08:56.224
TRANSMISSION. SO THAT DATA IS

03:08:56.291 --> 03:08:58.660
HOPEFUL FOR A FOR US TO REALLY

03:08:58.727 --> 03:09:00.929
HIGHLIGHT THE FACT THAT- IT'S

03:09:00.996 --> 03:09:02.831
IMPORTANT TO NOTICE THAT IT HAS

03:09:02.898 --> 03:09:03.865
TO BE THAT THERE'S MITIGATION

03:09:03.932 --> 03:09:05.333
STRATEGIES IN PLACE WE CAN'T

03:09:05.400 --> 03:09:08.870
JUST SAY IT'S SAFE TO RE OPEN-

03:09:08.937 --> 03:09:10.205
AND JUST DO IT HOWEVER YOU WANT

03:09:10.272 --> 03:09:12.040
TO DO IT BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT

03:09:12.107 --> 03:09:15.243
YOU KIND OPEN. IF YOU HAVE THE

03:09:15.310 --> 03:09:16.111
RIGHT MEDICATION STRATEGIES IN

03:09:16.178 --> 03:09:18.313
PLACE AND JUST A FEW OTHER

03:09:18.380 --> 03:09:20.282
PIECES OF DATA THAT YOU HAVE TO

03:09:20.348 --> 03:09:22.184
HAVE HIGHLIGHTED ONE WAS- BUT

03:09:22.250 --> 03:09:23.385
THE IDEA OF CHILDREN BEING

03:09:23.452 --> 03:09:25.587
SUPER SPIDERS- THE DATE ON THAT

03:09:25.654 --> 03:09:26.855
IS ALL ABOUT SYMPTOMATIC

03:09:26.922 --> 03:09:29.191
PATIENTS- SYMPTOMATIC- CHILDREN

03:09:29.257 --> 03:09:30.992
WHO'VE BEEN TESTED WHO HAVE

03:09:31.059 --> 03:09:33.995
HIGHER VIRAL LOADS- AND A

03:09:34.062 --> 03:09:35.464
CONCERN THERE AND THAT THERE'S

03:09:35.530 --> 03:09:37.999
A STUDY FROM INDIA ALSO. AGAIN

03:09:38.066 --> 03:09:39.267
FOCUSED ACTUALLY JUST ON

03:09:39.334 --> 03:09:41.403
SYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS SOME OF

03:09:41.470 --> 03:09:43.238
THE REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE IS

03:09:43.305 --> 03:09:44.372
THAT ONE OF THE MITIGATION

03:09:44.439 --> 03:09:45.707
STRATEGIES AND SYMPTOMS

03:09:45.774 --> 03:09:47.576
SCREENING WE GOT TO TAKE THAT

03:09:47.642 --> 03:09:49.711
SERIOUSLY WE DON'T TALK ABOUT

03:09:49.778 --> 03:09:50.979
AS MUCH BUT IT IS ONE OF THOSE

03:09:51.046 --> 03:09:52.447
IMPORTANT USEFUL THINGS AND

03:09:52.514 --> 03:09:53.448
WHEN I READ THOSE STUDIES I

03:09:53.515 --> 03:09:55.383
SAID GRANT WE HAVE. SOMETHING

03:09:55.450 --> 03:09:57.152
IN PLACE TO BREAK THAT CHAIN OF

03:09:57.219 --> 03:10:00.522
TRANSMISSION- AND THEN THE LAST

03:10:00.589 --> 03:10:05.393
PIECE OF THE CDC. DATA THERE'S-

03:10:05.460 --> 03:10:06.228
WE KNOW THAT THERE'S INCREASED

03:10:06.294 --> 03:10:09.297
RATES OF OUR- THIS IS THE END

03:10:09.364 --> 03:10:11.099
CHILDREN BUT THAT'S ACTUALLY

03:10:11.166 --> 03:10:12.000
TRUE BECAUSE A POPULAR RATES

03:10:12.067 --> 03:10:14.402
ARE. AND THERE IS ANOTHER STUDY

03:10:14.469 --> 03:10:16.938
LAST WEEK FROM THE CDC SHOWING

03:10:17.005 --> 03:10:18.740
THAT THE RATE AND CHILDREN OF

03:10:18.807 --> 03:10:20.842
THE INCREASE IS THE SAME AS THE

03:10:20.909 --> 03:10:22.444
POPULATION RATE AND SCHOOL AGE

03:10:22.511 --> 03:10:25.714
CHILDREN AND THE YOUNG ADULTS

03:10:25.781 --> 03:10:26.815
EIGHTEEN TO I THINK I WAS

03:10:26.882 --> 03:10:27.415
TWENTY FOUR ALTHOUGH IT MIGHT

03:10:27.482 --> 03:10:28.316
HAVE BEEN THE SLIGHTLY OLDER

03:10:28.383 --> 03:10:30.552
AGE RANGE THAT. SLOPE IS

03:10:30.619 --> 03:10:31.820
ACTUALLY SPEAKER INDICATING

03:10:31.887 --> 03:10:33.121
THAT THERE IS ACTUALLY ACTIVE

03:10:33.188 --> 03:10:35.724
TRANSMISSION IN THAT AGE GROUP

03:10:35.791 --> 03:10:37.459
MORE SO THAN AND OF THE YOUNGER

03:10:37.526 --> 03:10:39.995
AGE GROUP AND SO THE CDC

03:10:40.061 --> 03:10:41.463
CONCLUSION IS THAT SCHOOL RE

03:10:41.530 --> 03:10:44.800
OPENING DID NOT IS NOT DRIVING

03:10:44.866 --> 03:10:46.101
TRANSMISSION. AND THERE. AT THE

03:10:46.168 --> 03:10:47.636
END OF THAT REPORT WAS SCHOOL

03:10:47.702 --> 03:10:48.904
SHOULD BE THE LAST NAMES TO

03:10:48.970 --> 03:10:50.338
CLOSE AND THE FIRST THINGS TO

03:10:50.405 --> 03:10:53.108
OPEN. SO THAT DATA TO ME IS ALL

03:10:53.175 --> 03:10:54.910
VERY IMPORTANT DATA FOR US TO

03:10:54.976 --> 03:10:57.379
BETTER UNDERSTAND- YOU KNOW.

03:10:57.445 --> 03:10:59.848
THAT IT IT IS STILL THE GOAL IS

03:10:59.915 --> 03:11:03.885
TO DO SAFE. REOPENING AND

03:11:03.952 --> 03:11:06.254
REASONABLE APPROACHES. OKAY

03:11:06.321 --> 03:11:08.056
RESHAPE THAT PRESENTATION I

03:11:08.123 --> 03:11:10.392
GUESS THE ADDED A COUPLE FOLLOW

03:11:10.458 --> 03:11:12.027
UP QUESTIONS THAT NUMBER ONE IS

03:11:12.093 --> 03:11:13.728
THAT AND I KNOW YOU'RE LOOKING

03:11:13.795 --> 03:11:16.064
AT THE STUDIES. IN OUR OWN

03:11:16.131 --> 03:11:18.834
STATE WE DO HAVE- SUMS SOME

03:11:18.900 --> 03:11:20.402
SITUATIONS IN WHICH THERE ARE

03:11:20.468 --> 03:11:22.003
KIDS GOING TO IN PERSON

03:11:22.070 --> 03:11:23.438
LEARNING PRODUCT PERHAPS MORE

03:11:23.505 --> 03:11:25.106
IN SOME PRIVATE SCHOOLS OR

03:11:25.173 --> 03:11:27.676
OTHER PLACES. ARE WE COLLECTING

03:11:27.742 --> 03:11:29.411
DATA INCLUDING CONTACT TRACING

03:11:29.477 --> 03:11:31.213
ON ANY OUTBREAKS OF THINGS

03:11:31.279 --> 03:11:33.615
GOING ON IN SCHOOLS THAT ARE

03:11:33.682 --> 03:11:35.984
DOING. IN PERSON LEARNING HERE

03:11:36.051 --> 03:11:37.485
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS

03:11:37.552 --> 03:11:40.121
WELL PUBLIC AND PRIVATE- I

03:11:40.188 --> 03:11:41.523
REALIZE THAT WE JUST ASK THE

03:11:41.590 --> 03:11:43.358
QUESTION HOPE THAT SINCE THE

03:11:43.425 --> 03:11:44.459
BAR EDUCATION COULD TELL US HOW

03:11:44.526 --> 03:11:45.227
WHICH CHOOLS ARE HAVING

03:11:45.293 --> 03:11:47.629
SCHOOLS ARE OPEN BUT- IT IS

03:11:47.696 --> 03:11:48.897
THERE SUFFICIENT CONTACT

03:11:48.964 --> 03:11:49.965
TRACING DATA THAT WE CAN FEEL

03:11:50.031 --> 03:11:52.100
CONFIDENT. THAT THEIR OWN

03:11:52.167 --> 03:11:53.468
EXPERIENCE IN CALIFORNIA WITH

03:11:53.535 --> 03:11:57.138
THE SCHOOLS THAT ARE OPEN- THAT.

03:11:57.205 --> 03:11:58.139
THAT WE'RE NOT SEEING THE

03:11:58.206 --> 03:11:59.307
TRANSMISSION THAT'S HAPPENING

03:11:59.374 --> 03:12:01.109
AS A RESULT OF THE STATE.

03:12:01.176 --> 03:12:02.244
STUDENTS ATTENDING SCHOOL AND I

03:12:02.310 --> 03:12:03.578
KNOW THIS MAINLY APPLIES TO

03:12:03.645 --> 03:12:04.379
YOUNGER STUDENTS WERE NOT

03:12:04.446 --> 03:12:06.214
TALKING ABOUT THE TEENS WERE

03:12:06.281 --> 03:12:07.215
FOCUSING ON ON THE YOUNGER

03:12:07.282 --> 03:12:09.551
STUDENTS. YEAH THAT'S RIGHT- SO

03:12:09.618 --> 03:12:11.753
THERE'S SOME DATA IT'S NOT LIKE

03:12:11.820 --> 03:12:14.222
I. I WOULD SAY IT'S NOT

03:12:14.289 --> 03:12:16.391
SYSTEMATICALLY COLLECTED- AS

03:12:16.458 --> 03:12:18.126
YOU KNOW WHEN I CAN FROM MY

03:12:18.193 --> 03:12:19.928
POSITION AND SAN FRANCISCO

03:12:19.995 --> 03:12:20.729
LISTENING AND TRYING TO HEAR

03:12:20.795 --> 03:12:22.497
OTHER OUTBREAKS. I'M NOT

03:12:22.564 --> 03:12:23.698
HEARING ANY OUTBREAKS I'VE BEEN

03:12:23.765 --> 03:12:25.267
TALKING TO SEMICIRCULAR CISCO

03:12:25.333 --> 03:12:26.701
DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH. MY

03:12:26.768 --> 03:12:27.969
UNDERSTAND FROM SAN DIEGO IS

03:12:28.036 --> 03:12:29.571
THEY'RE NOT SEEING OUTBREAKS

03:12:29.638 --> 03:12:30.872
AND IT'S THE OUTBREAK SINCE THE

03:12:30.939 --> 03:12:32.073
IN SCHOOL TRANSMISSION THAT WE

03:12:32.140 --> 03:12:34.042
REALLY ARE LOOKING FOR AND I

03:12:34.109 --> 03:12:35.343
THINK THERE'S TWO REASONS LOOK

03:12:35.410 --> 03:12:37.445
FOR A WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND. IS

03:12:37.512 --> 03:12:38.847
THEIR ON GOING TRANSMISSION

03:12:38.914 --> 03:12:40.782
WE'RE NOT THAT THAT WERE NOT

03:12:40.849 --> 03:12:42.617
THAT. THE DATA IS NOT HELPING

03:12:42.684 --> 03:12:43.618
US TO ANTICIPATE WE WANT TO

03:12:43.685 --> 03:12:44.986
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE BE ABLE

03:12:45.053 --> 03:12:46.955
ABLE TO SEE THAT. AND HEN THE

03:12:47.022 --> 03:12:49.090
OTHER PIECE THAT. WE NEED TO

03:12:49.157 --> 03:12:50.759
LEARN IF THIRDS TRANSMISSION WE

03:12:50.825 --> 03:12:51.760
KNOW WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND

03:12:51.826 --> 03:12:52.994
WHAT'S GOING ON IN ORDER TO

03:12:53.061 --> 03:12:53.528
PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING

03:12:53.595 --> 03:12:55.897
AGAIN. AND OUR TO HAVE

03:12:55.964 --> 03:12:57.098
EVERYBODY UNDERSTAND WHAT'S THE

03:12:57.165 --> 03:12:58.800
BEST WAY TO DO IT THAT'S WHY

03:12:58.867 --> 03:12:59.401
IT'S HELPFUL TO LOOK AT THESE

03:12:59.467 --> 03:13:02.404
OTHER- YOU KNOW PLACES IN NORTH

03:13:02.470 --> 03:13:04.139
CAROLINA RATHER. PUBLICATIONS

03:13:04.205 --> 03:13:05.273
THAT TELL US YOU KNOW WHAT OF

03:13:05.340 --> 03:13:06.007
THAT ONE OF THE THINGS TO DO

03:13:06.074 --> 03:13:08.343
RIGHT- AND THAT THERE ARE SOME

03:13:08.410 --> 03:13:09.544
CASES FROM THE NORTH CAROLINA

03:13:09.611 --> 03:13:11.646
PAPERS ARE. BASED BASED OFF

03:13:11.713 --> 03:13:12.814
WHEN THEY DID HAVE AN OUTBREAK

03:13:12.881 --> 03:13:13.982
THAT IT WAS RELATED TO

03:13:14.049 --> 03:13:15.884
PRESCHOOLS NOT MASKING AND

03:13:15.951 --> 03:13:17.319
SPECIALIZED SITUATIONS WHERE

03:13:17.385 --> 03:13:18.520
KIDS WERE SITTING REALLY CLOSE

03:13:18.586 --> 03:13:19.921
TOGETHER WHILE THEY'RE EATING.

03:13:19.988 --> 03:13:21.623
SO THAT THAT WAS GREAT YOU KNOW

03:13:21.690 --> 03:13:22.824
LESSONS LEARNED FOR WHAT THEY

03:13:22.891 --> 03:13:25.660
CAN DO DIFFERENTLY SO- THE ONE

03:13:25.727 --> 03:13:27.128
OF THE GOALS OF THIS.

03:13:27.195 --> 03:13:28.229
INITIATIVE INCLUDES THAT

03:13:28.296 --> 03:13:30.665
TRANSPARENCY COLOR FOR EXACTLY

03:13:30.732 --> 03:13:31.599
THE REASON YOU GUYS ARE TALKING

03:13:31.666 --> 03:13:32.834
ABOUT WE WANT TO BETTER

03:13:32.901 --> 03:13:33.835
UNDERSTAND HOW MANY SCHOOLS ARE

03:13:33.902 --> 03:13:35.270
OPEN AND THEN ALSO REALLY

03:13:35.337 --> 03:13:36.504
UNDERSTAND THAT YOU DON'T IS

03:13:36.571 --> 03:13:38.573
THEIR TRANSMISSION GOING ON OR

03:13:38.640 --> 03:13:40.141
IS THIS. YOU KNOW HYPOTHESIS

03:13:40.208 --> 03:13:41.810
PROTEST I PROCESS ALL THE DATA

03:13:41.876 --> 03:13:43.945
REGISTER NOW THAT SAYS THERE IS

03:13:44.012 --> 03:13:45.413
VERY LIMITED TRANSMISSION THAT

03:13:45.480 --> 03:13:46.915
HAPPENS IF YOU HAVE THE RIGHT

03:13:46.982 --> 03:13:48.783
MEDICATION STRATEGY IN PLACE.

03:13:48.850 --> 03:13:50.018
WE WANT TO DOUBLE CHECK THAT'S

03:13:50.085 --> 03:13:51.219
TRUE IN OUR CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS

03:13:51.286 --> 03:13:52.654
AS WELL SO I GUESS THAT FIND

03:13:52.721 --> 03:14:01.830
THE FINAL PART. IS THAT. SO WE

03:14:01.896 --> 03:14:02.430
HAVE OUR TEACHER EARLY SHOPPER

03:14:02.497 --> 03:14:04.966
ZENSAR. SAYS SCIENCE THAT. THE

03:14:05.033 --> 03:14:07.335
HEARING FROM THEM. BETTER

03:14:07.402 --> 03:14:07.969
REALLY CONCERNED AND DON'T WANT

03:14:08.036 --> 03:14:09.804
TO REAL. AT THE LEVEL THAT YOU

03:14:09.871 --> 03:14:11.806
ABOUT. WHAT OF COMMUNITY. HAS

03:14:11.873 --> 03:14:14.709
BEEN HAPPENING BETWEEN. C. P.

03:14:14.776 --> 03:14:16.344
H. IN NICE IN YOUR VETTING

03:14:16.411 --> 03:14:18.013
DEPARTED SCHOOL SAFETY TEAM

03:14:18.079 --> 03:14:21.916
DAN'S- SCHOOL EMPLOYEES- AND

03:14:21.983 --> 03:14:23.184
WHAT KIND OF DOLLARS GOING ON

03:14:23.251 --> 03:14:25.487
IN TERMS OF TALKING ABOUT THE

03:14:25.553 --> 03:14:27.122
EVIDENCE THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT

03:14:27.188 --> 03:14:28.923
BECAUSE I THINK SOME RIGHT TO

03:14:28.990 --> 03:14:29.557
QUESTIONS RAISED ABOUT SOME OF

03:14:29.624 --> 03:14:31.226
THE STUDIES ETCETERA. THAT WE

03:14:31.292 --> 03:14:32.927
CAN AT LEAST COME TO SOME

03:14:32.994 --> 03:14:36.331
GENERAL AGREEMENT ABOUT WHERE

03:14:36.398 --> 03:14:40.368
WE SHOULD BE DOING THIS- SO- SO

03:14:40.435 --> 03:14:42.871
KEY AND TO A CERTAIN TIME OF

03:14:42.937 --> 03:14:44.806
THAT'S FOR YOU TO ANSWER OR FOR

03:14:44.873 --> 03:14:48.009
THIS- FOR MISTER ALLEN. AND I'M

03:14:48.076 --> 03:14:50.512
ALSO CURIOUS TO HEAR FROM THE

03:14:50.578 --> 03:14:52.280
BOTH OF THEM THIS EASTERLING

03:14:52.347 --> 03:14:53.915
AND MISTER BROWN TERMS OF

03:14:53.982 --> 03:14:55.784
FLIGHT. COMMUNICATIONS BEEN

03:14:55.850 --> 03:14:56.785
HAVING IN TERMS OF REVIEWING

03:14:56.851 --> 03:14:59.087
THIS DATA AND EVIDENCE TO COME

03:14:59.154 --> 03:15:00.088
TO SOME GENERAL AGREEMENT ABOUT

03:15:00.155 --> 03:15:02.791
OKAY- NOW PEOPLE FEEL

03:15:02.857 --> 03:15:03.858
COMFORTABLE ABOUT THESE ARE THE

03:15:03.925 --> 03:15:04.893
STANDARDS WE NEEDS IN THE

03:15:04.959 --> 03:15:06.528
COMMUNITY HAVE REALIZES ALSO

03:15:06.594 --> 03:15:07.328
THINGS THAT HAVE TO HAPPEN IN

03:15:07.395 --> 03:15:08.963
THE SCHOOLS YOU SAID. THAT

03:15:09.030 --> 03:15:10.832
PEOPLE THAT THAT THE SCHOOL

03:15:10.899 --> 03:15:12.834
EMPLOYEES FEEL COMFORTABLE TO

03:15:12.901 --> 03:15:15.036
GO BACK TO WORK AND- THE SAID

03:15:15.103 --> 03:15:16.137
DAVE ALL EVERYONE'S EXPRESSED A

03:15:16.204 --> 03:15:20.809
DESIRE TO GO BACK AND. AND

03:15:20.875 --> 03:15:23.411
DOING IN PERSON LEARNING- YOU

03:15:23.478 --> 03:15:24.879
HAVE A BILL OF SAY ONE OR TWO

03:15:24.946 --> 03:15:28.316
THINGS WHICH IS THAT I- YOU

03:15:28.383 --> 03:15:28.783
KNOW HAVING HAD THESE

03:15:28.850 --> 03:15:30.585
CONVERSATIONS. FOR A LONG TIME

03:15:30.652 --> 03:15:33.154
NOW WITH- EVEN BEFORE I CAME TO

03:15:33.221 --> 03:15:34.355
THIS ROLE IN EARLY DECEMBER

03:15:34.422 --> 03:15:36.091
TALKING JERRY- TEACHERS AND

03:15:36.157 --> 03:15:37.659
TEACHERS UNIONS THROUGHOUT THE

03:15:37.725 --> 03:15:39.627
SUMMER SINCE APRIL I THINK THAT

03:15:39.694 --> 03:15:41.129
THERE'S ONE REALLY IMPORTANT TO

03:15:41.196 --> 03:15:42.130
SAY WHICH IS THAT I THINK

03:15:42.197 --> 03:15:44.265
THERE'S- YOU KNOW

03:15:44.332 --> 03:15:46.367
UNDERSTANDABLE ABSOLUTELY.

03:15:46.434 --> 03:15:50.305
POSSIBLE ANXIETY AND FEAR. AND

03:15:50.371 --> 03:15:52.140
SO THERE'S A PART OF THE ISSUES

03:15:52.207 --> 03:15:54.509
THERE'S DATA AND THEN THERE'S

03:15:54.576 --> 03:15:56.611
ALSO AN EXPERIENCE OF YOU KNOW

03:15:56.678 --> 03:15:58.113
BEING PART OF A PANDEMIC AND

03:15:58.179 --> 03:15:59.247
BEING PART OF ME THAT'S PART OF

03:15:59.314 --> 03:16:00.782
THE PANDEMIC SO. I ACTUALLY

03:16:00.849 --> 03:16:02.016
THINK THAT WE NEED TO REGARD

03:16:02.083 --> 03:16:03.084
SOCK ABOUT BOTH OF THOSE

03:16:03.151 --> 03:16:06.721
PIECES- I. I ACTUALLY HAVE IT

03:16:06.788 --> 03:16:08.189
ON MY TO DO IS TO REACH OUT TO

03:16:08.256 --> 03:16:09.991
MISTER BROWN ACTUALLY AND TO

03:16:10.058 --> 03:16:11.025
OFFER TO TALK TO THE SCIENCE

03:16:11.092 --> 03:16:12.026
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY

03:16:12.093 --> 03:16:14.229
IMPORTANT TO. MAKE SURE THAT WE

03:16:14.295 --> 03:16:15.163
HAVE A SHARED AN UNDERSTANDING

HARRISON WHO'S AN OCCUPATIONAL

03:17:49.057 --> 03:17:50.525
HEALTH DOCTOR SO IT'S NOT LIKE

03:17:50.592 --> 03:17:51.626
THIS IS JUST SOMETHING THAT

03:17:51.693 --> 03:17:53.361
WERE. PUTTING OUT THERE IS WHAT

03:17:53.428 --> 03:17:55.196
WE SAY IS UNSAFE WE ACTUALLY

03:17:55.263 --> 03:17:56.731
WORK WITH WITH THE DOCTOR AND I

03:17:56.798 --> 03:17:57.599
THINK WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE

03:17:57.665 --> 03:17:59.300
STANDUP AND GIVES REALLY GREAT

03:17:59.367 --> 03:18:02.003
DOCTORS CAN DIFFER ON ON ON ON

03:18:02.070 --> 03:18:03.771
WHAT ON THEIR OPINIONS. AND

03:18:03.838 --> 03:18:04.739
THEN I'LL POINT TO A MOST

03:18:04.806 --> 03:18:06.307
RECENT STUDY OUT OF MONTREAL

03:18:06.374 --> 03:18:07.875
WHICH I THINK IT WAS THE FULL

03:18:07.942 --> 03:18:09.744
STUDY THAT WE MAY WANT INCLUDED

03:18:09.811 --> 03:18:11.246
IN THE IN THE DIALOGUE WHICH

03:18:11.312 --> 03:18:12.981
ACTUALLY SHOW THAT THAT THAT

03:18:13.047 --> 03:18:15.650
STUDENTS ARE. ARE CAN SPREAD

03:18:15.717 --> 03:18:17.285
THE VIRUS AND THAT WOULD

03:18:17.352 --> 03:18:18.119
PROBABLY BE THE MOST RECENT

03:18:18.186 --> 03:18:22.757
DATA- AND JUST. I THINK WHAT.

03:18:22.824 --> 03:18:25.460
IS MOST HELPFUL MOVING FORWARD

03:18:25.526 --> 03:18:26.194
IS THE IDEA THAT SCHOOL

03:18:26.261 --> 03:18:29.330
DISTRICTS- WILL HAVE TO REPORT

03:18:29.397 --> 03:18:31.633
THE DATA BECAUSE IT HASN'T BEEN

03:18:31.699 --> 03:18:33.101
TRANSPARENT YOU KNOW IN THE

03:18:33.167 --> 03:18:34.902
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OTHER

03:18:34.969 --> 03:18:37.472
STATES HAVE HAD DATA DASHBOARDS

03:18:37.538 --> 03:18:39.574
FOR MONTHS. AND WE DON'T HAVE

03:18:39.641 --> 03:18:42.110

03:18:42.176 --> 03:18:43.911
POLICY LEADS US TO ACTUALLY

03:18:43.978 --> 03:18:45.413
SHOWING AND DEMONSTRATING

03:18:45.480 --> 03:18:46.381
WHAT'S HAPPENING UNDER SCHOOL

03:18:46.447 --> 03:18:48.082
SITES THAT'S A GREAT THING BUT

03:18:48.149 --> 03:18:50.084
IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN

03:18:50.151 --> 03:18:52.820

DOCTOR. IS COMPLETELY CORRECT

THERE IS A- INTENSE AMOUNT OF

03:18:59.594 --> 03:19:01.996
FEAR IN IT AMONG OUR RANK AND

03:19:02.063 --> 03:19:04.565
FILE- THINKING THAT THEY'RE

03:19:04.632 --> 03:19:06.167

03:19:06.234 --> 03:19:08.770

THAT DOES. THE IMPACT OPINION

03:19:15.443 --> 03:19:19.180
QUITE A BIT. AS A ORGANIZATION

03:19:19.247 --> 03:19:21.282
WE'VE DONE OUR DUE DILIGENCE-

03:19:21.349 --> 03:19:22.717

COLLEAGUE FROM CTA STATES IT IT

03:19:36.864 --> 03:19:38.599
DOES SEEM LIKE. YOU CAN ASK TO

03:19:38.666 --> 03:19:40.601
DOCTORS AND I'M A LAWYER BY ALL

03:19:40.668 --> 03:19:41.769
MEANS I KNOW YOU CAN ASK TWO

03:19:41.836 --> 03:19:43.004
PEOPLE QUESTION YOU GET TO A

03:19:43.071 --> 03:19:44.672
DIFFERENT ANSWERS AND I IT'S

03:19:44.739 --> 03:19:47.442
REFRESHING TO KNOW THAT THIS

03:19:47.508 --> 03:19:47.909
HAPPENS IN THE MEDICAL

03:19:47.975 --> 03:19:50.578
COMMUNITY AS WELL PERHAPS- BUT-

03:19:50.645 --> 03:19:51.713
TO THAT. TO THAT DEGREE YOU

03:19:51.779 --> 03:19:52.747
KNOW WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE

03:19:52.814 --> 03:19:55.049
CONVERSATIONS ARE TO FIGURE

03:19:55.116 --> 03:19:57.552
THAT OUT AND JUST NOW I AM

03:19:57.618 --> 03:19:59.921
NOTICING THE SACRAMENTO BEE. IS

03:19:59.987 --> 03:20:01.956
REPORTING THAT THERE ROSA

03:20:02.023 --> 03:20:04.258
ROSEVILLE- SCHOOLS HAVE HAD TO

03:20:04.325 --> 03:20:05.927
A QUARANTINE AND HUNDREDS OF.

03:20:05.993 --> 03:20:07.695
STUDENTS ARE HAVING TO

03:20:07.762 --> 03:20:08.296
QUARANTINE BECAUSE THEY TRIED

03:20:08.363 --> 03:20:10.031
TO GO BACK. TRIED TO PLAY

03:20:10.098 --> 03:20:12.133
SPORTS. AND SO WHEN WE TALK

03:20:12.200 --> 03:20:13.901
ABOUT THE BEST LAID PLANS AND

03:20:13.968 --> 03:20:14.902
WE UNDERSTAND THE MITIGATION

03:20:14.969 --> 03:20:16.671
STRATEGIES THAT ARE PART OF

03:20:16.738 --> 03:20:18.306
THESE PLANS. WE ARE TALKING

03:20:18.373 --> 03:20:20.675
ABOUT. YOUNG STUDENTS WERE

03:20:20.742 --> 03:20:23.010
TALKING ABOUT POPULATIONS OF.

03:20:23.077 --> 03:20:24.278
MAYBE YOU KNOW THE OLDER SO I

03:20:24.345 --> 03:20:25.079
KNOW WHEN I TALK ABOUT OLDER

03:20:25.146 --> 03:20:27.181
STUDENTS COMING BACK YET. BUT

03:20:27.248 --> 03:20:29.617
IT'S A GENERATION OR AGE GROUP

03:20:29.684 --> 03:20:33.321
RENOWNED FOR- BUCKING THE-

03:20:33.388 --> 03:20:35.390
ESTABLISHMENT GUIDANCE AND SO

03:20:35.456 --> 03:20:37.258
THERE ARE GOING TO BE. LARGE

03:20:37.325 --> 03:20:39.327
LEAKS THERE ARE GOING TO BE

03:20:39.394 --> 03:20:42.296
MASS TRANS MISSIONS WE BELIEVE

03:20:42.363 --> 03:20:44.966
WHEN YOU BRING. SO MANY FOLKS

03:20:45.032 --> 03:20:46.401
BACK TO SCHOOL TO GO BACK TO SO

03:20:46.467 --> 03:20:47.835
MANY HOUSEHOLD TO INTERACT IN

03:20:47.902 --> 03:20:49.504
SO MANY WAYS IT'S A COMPOUNDING

03:20:49.570 --> 03:20:50.605
ISSUE AND SO WE NEED TO MAKE

03:20:50.671 --> 03:20:51.439
SURE WE'RE GOING TO DO IT

03:20:51.506 --> 03:20:54.075
RIGHT. AND TO SENATOR CORTEZ

03:20:54.142 --> 03:20:58.980
HE'S- SENTIMENT. THAT'S IT.

03:20:59.046 --> 03:21:01.215
LET'S MAKE SURE WE'RE PUTTING.

03:21:01.282 --> 03:21:03.084
OUR HORSES IN FRONT OF CARDS

03:21:03.151 --> 03:21:04.585
USE THE METAPHOR YOU'D LIKE BUT

03:21:04.652 --> 03:21:06.454
ITSEEMS TO PICK A DATE AND SAY

03:21:06.521 --> 03:21:09.891
NO WE CAN MAKE THIS WORK- IS

03:21:09.957 --> 03:21:10.425
NOT THE BEST STRATEGY WHEN

03:21:10.491 --> 03:21:13.394
LIVES ARE AT STAKE- SO IT SEEMS

03:21:13.461 --> 03:21:16.497
TO ME- THAT AND AGAIN I AM VERY

03:21:16.564 --> 03:21:18.499
SYMPATHETIC. TO THE GOVERNOR'S

03:21:18.566 --> 03:21:19.801
DESIRED AND I THINK THERE'S A

03:21:19.867 --> 03:21:21.068
LOT OF PEOPLE WILL. THINK

03:21:21.135 --> 03:21:23.771
LEADING MYSELF WOULD LOVE TO

03:21:23.838 --> 03:21:24.338
SEE YOUR KIDS BE ABLE TO GO

03:21:24.405 --> 03:21:25.773
BACK TO SCHOOL- IN PERSON

03:21:25.840 --> 03:21:26.641
LEARNING I THINK IT'S GOING TO

03:21:26.707 --> 03:21:28.376
IS AND I THINK IT WAS EXPRESSED

03:21:28.443 --> 03:21:30.077
THIS IS. ONLY GONNA BE BETTERED

03:21:30.144 --> 03:21:31.479
AND DISTANCE LEARNING ON

03:21:31.546 --> 03:21:34.849
AVERAGE- BUT I ALSO FEEL THAT.

03:21:34.916 --> 03:21:36.984
WE HAVEN'T REALLY DONE OUR

03:21:37.051 --> 03:21:39.053
GROUND WORK. IN TERMS OF TRYING

03:21:39.120 --> 03:21:40.988
TO MOVE THIS TRIAL PROPOSAL

03:21:41.055 --> 03:21:42.423
BECAUSE IF THE TEACHERS ARE

03:21:42.490 --> 03:21:43.991
TELLING US LIKE OKAY WELL WE

03:21:44.058 --> 03:21:45.159

EXAMINATION THE DATA AND I

03:21:49.363 --> 03:21:50.498
CERTAINLY AGREE THAT I DON'T

03:21:50.565 --> 03:21:51.532
THINK THE TEACHERS ARE JUST

03:21:51.599 --> 03:21:53.768
MAKING THIS UP THERE. THEY HAD

03:21:53.835 --> 03:21:54.302
THEIR CONSULTING THEIR OWN

03:21:54.368 --> 03:21:56.204
EXPERTS AND SO FORTH. WE NEED

03:21:56.270 --> 03:21:56.838
TO GET TO SOME KIND OF

03:21:56.904 --> 03:21:58.439
CONSENSUS WE ALSO NEED TO BE

03:21:58.506 --> 03:21:59.841

03:22:05.012 --> 03:22:06.414
ALSO AND THEN WE HAVE AN EVEN

03:22:06.481 --> 03:22:07.181

TO HAVE. THE CAPACITY TO

03:22:14.088 --> 03:22:15.857
IMPLEMENT AND KIND OF SORT OF

03:22:15.923 --> 03:22:17.391
NARROWLY MORE FOCUSED ON THE

03:22:17.458 --> 03:22:19.260
TESTING PIECE OFIT BUT- EVEN

03:22:19.327 --> 03:22:20.862
