WITH OTHER RECENT COMPAQ'S.

00:30:12.977 --> 00:30:14.012
BECAUSE THE TRIBE PLANS ARE

00:30:14.078 --> 00:30:15.713
EXTREMELY REMOTE THERE'S

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:17.649

IT WOULD HAVE ON THE TRIBE IN

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:06.297

NOT PAY SUCH COSTS FOR THE PAST

00:31:08.466 --> 00:31:10.168

FEDERAL LAW.

00:35:37.001 --> 00:35:37.802

THAT ARE LEGAL WITHIN THAT STATE

00:35:51.148 --> 00:35:53.150

I'M KIND OF CURIOUS OF HOW THESE

00:52:24.107 --> 00:52:26.443
GUNS AND GAMBLING.

00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:30.146
BRINGING GUNS. TO TO THE RICH

SURE THAT THEY'RE REGISTERED --

00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:34.351
UNDER THE CHAIRMAN MAY THINK

00:52:34.417 --> 00:52:35.652
IT'S OKAY TO HAVE GUNS AND

00:52:35.719 --> 00:52:37.420
GAMBLING AT THE SAME TIME.

00:52:37.487 --> 00:52:39.155
IT WORKS SO WELL FOR WHILE BILL

00:52:39.222 --> 00:52:40.690
HICKOK'S ALIVE JUST KIND OF

00:52:40.757 --> 00:52:42.259
WHERE CAN THEY BRING.

00:52:42.325 --> 00:52:44.694
THOSE WEAPONS IN I KNOW YOU SAY

00:52:44.761 --> 00:52:46.129
THEY BRING TO ROOM.

00:52:46.196 --> 00:52:49.199
BUT THEY DON'T BRING IT DOWN TO

00:52:49.266 --> 00:52:51.167
THE TABLES OR ANY A NO I DON'T

00:52:51.234 --> 00:52:51.801

00:52:53.036 --> 00:52:54.571
NO ONE'S BRINGING IN SOMETHING

00:52:54.638 --> 00:52:56.373
THAT COULD BE VERY HARMFUL

00:52:56.439 --> 00:52:58.475
WITHIN.

00:52:58.542 --> 00:53:00.944
THE CASINO SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR

00:53:01.011 --> 00:53:02.546

THE THERE ARE NO GUNS THAT ARE

00:53:05.815 --> 00:53:07.384
ALLOWED ON THE GAMING FLOOR.

00:53:07.450 --> 00:53:09.653
SO OUR CASINO OF COURSE IS

00:53:09.719 --> 00:53:12.389
SEPARATE FROM OUR HOTEL.

00:53:12.455 --> 00:53:14.057
WE HAVE A SEPARATE ENTRANCE AND

00:53:14.124 --> 00:53:18.562

00:53:21.665 --> 00:53:22.532
LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

00:53:22.599 --> 00:53:25.435

00:53:30.206 --> 00:53:31.474
SOME SOME PEOPLE THAT ARE

00:53:31.541 --> 00:53:33.510
HUNTING -- ONE OF THE THINGS

00:53:33.577 --> 00:53:35.211
ABOUT LASSEN COUNTY IS THAT IT

00:53:35.278 --> 00:53:37.614
IS A BIG HUNTING AREA -- BUT YES

00:53:37.681 --> 00:53:39.783
THEY ARE THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO

00:53:39.849 --> 00:53:41.351
BE LOADED WHEN THEY'RE THERE.

00:53:41.418 --> 00:53:42.652
THEIR AMMUNITION IS SUPPOSED TO

00:53:54.197 --> 00:53:54.864
STOLEN.

00:53:54.931 --> 00:53:57.467

ENFORCE LAWS.

00:54:11.514 --> 00:54:13.783
