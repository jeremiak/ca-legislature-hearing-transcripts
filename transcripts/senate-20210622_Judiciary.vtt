ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED BY THE

00:46:13.704 --> 00:46:15.806
OPPOSITION REGARDS TO THE

00:46:15.873 --> 00:46:18.408
BUSINESS TO BUSINESS CONTRACTS.

AWARE OF THE FEES CHARGED TO

00:46:26.650 --> 00:46:28.952
RESTAURANTS- THROUGHOUT THE

00:46:29.019 --> 00:46:30.854
PANDEMIC IMPACT WE SAW A LOT OF.

00:46:30.921 --> 00:46:33.657
COMMERCIALS SUGGESTING HOW

00:46:33.724 --> 00:46:35.592
THESE THIRD PARTY DELIVERY APPS

00:46:35.659 --> 00:46:36.860
FOR KEEPING THESE RESTAURANTS

00:46:36.927 --> 00:46:38.362
UPLOAD AND ALTHOUGH TECHNICALLY

00:46:38.428 --> 00:46:40.130
THAT MIGHT BE TRUE A LOT OF

00:46:40.197 --> 00:46:42.099
CONSUMERS DON'T UNDERSTAND THE

00:46:42.166 --> 00:46:43.634
TRUE COST OF THAT A LOCAL

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:46.170
RESTAURANT- MUST BEAR IN ORDER

00:46:46.236 --> 00:46:47.871
TO HAVE THE FOOD DELIVERED. WE

00:46:47.938 --> 00:46:49.640
THINK AS ESPECIALLY COMING OUT

00:46:49.706 --> 00:46:51.308
OF THE PANDEMIC FOR CONSUMERS

00:46:51.375 --> 00:46:52.776
TO MAKE EDUCATED AND WISE

00:46:52.843 --> 00:46:54.011
DECISIONS TO SUPPORT LOCAL

00:46:54.077 --> 00:46:55.345
RESTAURANTS HAVING THAT

00:46:55.412 --> 00:46:56.680
INFORMATION WILL HELP THEM MAKE

00:46:56.747 --> 00:46:57.981
A DECISION ON IF THEY ARE

00:46:58.048 --> 00:46:59.716
SUPPORTING. A RESTAURANT BY

00:46:59.783 --> 00:47:02.419
HAVING DELIVERY OR PERHAPS JUST

00:47:02.486 --> 00:47:04.655
GOING THEMSELVES TO PICK IT UP.

00:47:04.721 --> 00:47:06.657
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT

00:47:06.723 --> 00:47:07.591
ANSWER I GUESS I THOUGHT THE

00:47:07.658 --> 00:47:09.059
BILL I DON'T KNOW IF I WANT TO

00:47:09.126 --> 00:47:10.194
SAY THAT I SUPPORT THE BILL I'M

00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:13.096
GONNA VOTE FOR TODAY. BUT I- I.

00:47:13.163 --> 00:47:14.998
I THOUGHT THE BILL WAS A

00:47:15.065 --> 00:47:18.502
TRANSPARENCY BILL. IN REGARDS

00:47:18.569 --> 00:47:20.671
TO THE CONSUMER AND HOW MUCH OF

00:47:20.737 --> 00:47:21.972
CONSUMERS PAYING AND WHETHER

00:47:22.039 --> 00:47:23.207
IT'S REALLY BENEFITING IN THE

00:47:23.273 --> 00:47:24.575
RESTAURANT. IF A RESTAURANT

00:47:24.641 --> 00:47:25.909
DECIDES THAT THEY WANT TO GO

00:47:25.976 --> 00:47:27.544
WITH THAT PARTICULAR SERVICE.

00:47:27.611 --> 00:47:29.680
AND IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE THAN

00:47:29.746 --> 00:47:31.381
THE OTHERS BUT THE DELIVERY IS

00:47:31.448 --> 00:47:33.750
BETTER. AND THE FOOD ACTUALLY

00:47:33.817 --> 00:47:35.752
GETS THERE FASTER WHICH IS.

00:47:35.819 --> 00:47:37.554
MEAN THAT'S ONE OF THE ONE OF

00:47:37.621 --> 00:47:39.556
THE BENEFITS FOR ME IS THAT IF

00:47:39.623 --> 00:47:40.724
THE FOOD GETS THERE AND IT'S

00:47:40.791 --> 00:47:42.593
BEEN ON ITS WAY FOR HALF AN

00:47:42.659 --> 00:47:43.860
HOUR IT'S JUST NOT AS GOOD AS

00:47:43.927 --> 00:47:47.030
IF IT'S IF IT. ARRIVES RIGHT

00:47:47.097 --> 00:47:49.933
AWAY- IF. I GUESS I THOUGHT

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.635
THAT THE ISSUE. WITH THE

00:47:51.702 --> 00:47:53.136
PURPOSE OF THE BILL WAS A

00:47:53.203 --> 00:47:53.837
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT WHICH IS

00:47:53.904 --> 00:47:55.105
WHY I ASKED THE QUESTION.

00:47:55.172 --> 00:47:56.473
BECAUSE IT T SEEMS TO ME IF

00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:57.374
YOU HAVEA BUSINESS TO BUSINESS

00:47:57.441 --> 00:47:59.876
CONTRACT- RELATIONSHIP. IT'S

00:47:59.943 --> 00:48:02.813
MUCH MORE. EQUAL THAN A

00:48:02.879 --> 00:48:04.581
CONSUMER THAT HAS TO TAKE THAT

00:48:04.648 --> 00:48:06.450
PARTICULAR. SERVICE AND THAT'S

00:48:06.516 --> 00:48:09.219
ALL THERE IS TO IT. AND AND IT

00:48:09.286 --> 00:48:11.355
MAY BE MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE THAN

00:48:11.421 --> 00:48:11.955
THEY THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO

00:48:12.022 --> 00:48:15.926
BE. HI I AM I AM. I APPRECIATE

00:48:15.993 --> 00:48:16.593
WHERE YOU'RE GOING WITH THIS

00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:20.097
AND- I GUESS I JUST FEEL LIKE-

00:48:20.163 --> 00:48:22.132
I. THE BUSINESS TO BUSINESS HAS

00:48:22.199 --> 00:48:24.234
LESS OF A RELATIONSHIP TO THE-

00:48:24.301 --> 00:48:27.938
CUSTOMER AND THEN. WHAT I WILL

00:48:28.005 --> 00:48:30.040
PAY AS A CUSTOMER. IN ANY CASE

00:48:30.107 --> 00:48:30.507
I'M GONNA SUPPORT IT

00:48:30.574 --> 00:48:32.342
FINANCIALLY MEMBER CONSULTS YOU

00:48:32.409 --> 00:48:34.044
COULD RESPOND RESPOND CLOSELY

00:48:34.111 --> 00:48:35.812
AND TRANSPARENCY COULD BE FOR A

00:48:35.879 --> 00:48:37.414
LOT OF REASONS RIGHT SO WE WANT

00:48:37.481 --> 00:48:38.081
THE RESTAURANTS TO HAVE

00:48:38.148 --> 00:48:39.850
TRANSPARENCY- THERE IT THIS

00:48:39.916 --> 00:48:41.585
ISN'T VERY COMPETITIVE MARKET

00:48:41.652 --> 00:48:42.519
BACK THERE I THINK. THREE

00:48:42.586 --> 00:48:44.688
COMPANIES HAVE 95% MARKET

00:48:44.755 --> 00:48:46.423
SHARE. AND SO- WE WANT

00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:47.624
RESTAURANTS ESPECIALLY IN

00:48:47.691 --> 00:48:48.659
REALLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:48:48.725 --> 00:48:49.860
HERE IS SMALL MOM AND POP

00:48:49.926 --> 00:48:51.461
RESTAURANTS HAVE NOW ENTERED

00:48:51.528 --> 00:48:52.062
CONTRACTS INTO THESE DELIVERY

00:48:52.129 --> 00:48:54.998
SERVICES. FOR THE PURE SURVIVAL

00:48:55.065 --> 00:48:56.733
AND NOW WITH VERY MUCH LIKE

00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:59.269
THEIR CUSTOMERS TO RETURN- AND

00:48:59.336 --> 00:49:00.804
IN ORDER TO DO SO I THINK WE

00:49:00.871 --> 00:49:03.340
NEED SOME- ACCURATE ACCOUNTING

00:49:03.407 --> 00:49:07.544
OF. OF THE SITUATION THEY'RE IN.

00:49:07.611 --> 00:49:09.680
SORRY THANK YOU THANK YOU-

00:49:09.746 --> 00:49:14.584
CENTER BORDERS. THE RESEARCHER.

00:49:14.651 --> 00:49:18.588
I'VE SUPPORTED- I THINK ONE OF

00:49:18.655 --> 00:49:20.390
YOUR BILLS WAS LAST YEAR MAYBE

00:49:20.457 --> 00:49:22.259
ONE YEAR BEFORE ON-

00:49:22.326 --> 00:49:23.827
TRANSPARENCY EFFORTS WHEN IT

00:49:23.894 --> 00:49:26.963
COMES TO FOOD DELIVERY SERVICE.

00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:28.565
THIS BILL HOWEVER I THINK IT'S

00:49:28.632 --> 00:49:30.334
DIFFERENT THAN SOME OF THE

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:30.934
MATERIAL THAT YOU'VE WORKED ON

00:49:31.001 --> 00:49:32.469
IN THE PAST. ONE BECAUSE I

00:49:32.536 --> 00:49:36.740
THINK. HOW MUCH MONEY THESE TWO

00:49:36.807 --> 00:49:38.508
PRIVATE PARTIES ARE CONTRACTING

00:49:38.575 --> 00:49:40.243
FOR SENSHI BECOMES PRIVILEGED

00:49:40.310 --> 00:49:43.113
OR PROPRIETARY. AND TO FORCE

00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:45.015
THE DISCLOSURE OF THIS TYPE OF

00:49:45.082 --> 00:49:48.418
INFORMATION. IT'S NOT THAT I

00:49:48.485 --> 00:49:49.986
WOULD BE SURPRISED IF IT'S

00:49:50.053 --> 00:49:50.954
TRULY IN THE INTEREST OF THE

00:49:51.021 --> 00:49:53.523
CONSUMER BUT MORE TOWARDS THE

00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:56.727
NOTION THAT. YOU WANT TO-

00:49:56.793 --> 00:49:57.928
DEMONSTRATE THE INFLATIONARY

00:49:57.994 --> 00:49:59.629
ADJUSTMENTS OF FOOD DELIVERY

00:49:59.696 --> 00:50:02.699
SERVICE- AND DISCOURAGE THOSE

00:50:02.766 --> 00:50:06.169
FOLKS. FROM CONTINUING TO USE

00:50:06.236 --> 00:50:08.071
THAT OUR FOOD DELIVERY SERVICE

00:50:08.138 --> 00:50:10.273
IN OPT INSTEAD FOR EMPLOYEES

00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:11.608
WHO MIGHT DELIVER IT FOR THEM

00:50:11.675 --> 00:50:12.576
SO- FURTHER ON BEHALF OF THE

00:50:12.642 --> 00:50:14.511
RESTAURANT OR ENCOURAGE FOLKS

00:50:14.578 --> 00:50:16.380
COME BACK IN. SO EVEN THOUGH

00:50:16.446 --> 00:50:17.781
I'VE SUPPORTED YOUR EFFORTS IN

00:50:17.848 --> 00:50:19.816
THE PAST THIS ONE I JUST I

00:50:19.883 --> 00:50:23.019
CAN'T BUY INTO. ONLY BECAUSE IF

00:50:23.086 --> 00:50:25.856
WE WERE TO. MAKE AN EXAMPLE.

00:50:25.922 --> 00:50:27.924
YOU KNOW DO I HAVE A RIGHT TO

00:50:27.991 --> 00:50:30.026
ASK A RESTAURANT. YOU KNOW HOW

00:50:30.093 --> 00:50:33.029
MUCH IT IT PURCHASES ITS

00:50:33.096 --> 00:50:33.864
SUPPLIES FROM A PARTICULAR

00:50:33.930 --> 00:50:35.632
DISTRIBUTOR. AND THEY TELL ME

00:50:35.699 --> 00:50:37.834
TO POUND SAND. I'D BE LIKE NO

00:50:37.901 --> 00:50:38.502
BUT THAT'S THE TYPE OF

00:50:38.568 --> 00:50:39.803
TRANSPARENCY THAT I WANT

00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:41.071
BECAUSE I WANT TO KNOW IF I

00:50:41.138 --> 00:50:43.106
SHOULD KEEP IN FREQUENT YOUR

00:50:43.173 --> 00:50:45.342
ESTABLISHMENT. THERE'S CERTAIN

00:50:45.409 --> 00:50:46.276
BUSINESS TO BUSINESS

00:50:46.343 --> 00:50:47.811
CONFIDENTIALITY THAT MUST

00:50:47.878 --> 00:50:50.514
EXIST. IF YOU EXPOSE EVERYTHING

00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:52.616
TO THE LIGHT OF DAY. THEN I

00:50:52.682 --> 00:50:53.950
THINK THE OLD THE ULTIMATE

00:50:54.017 --> 00:50:55.719
OBJECTIVE IS MAKING CERTAIN

00:50:55.786 --> 00:50:57.187
THAT THE COMPETITORS KNOW

00:50:57.254 --> 00:50:59.289
WHAT'S AT PLAY. CARDS ACTUALLY

00:50:59.356 --> 00:51:02.058
DRIVE DOWN- THE COMPETITIVE

00:51:02.125 --> 00:51:04.261
MARKET PLACE IN ULTIMATELY

00:51:04.327 --> 00:51:06.763
EXPOSE THE PRINCIPLES. ARE IN

00:51:06.830 --> 00:51:08.532
DRIVE THEM AWAY FROM USING FOOD

00:51:08.598 --> 00:51:10.434
DELIVERY SERVICE SO IF. IF

00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:12.202
WE'RE INTERESTED IN THE IN

00:51:12.269 --> 00:51:13.370
PROMOTING PRIVATE ENTERPRISE

00:51:13.437 --> 00:51:17.240
AND- IN FREE ENTERPRISE- THIS I

00:51:17.307 --> 00:51:19.109
THINK IS JUST A BRIDGE TOO FAR

00:51:19.176 --> 00:51:22.446
RESPECTFULLY- AND A UNITED- MAY

00:51:22.512 --> 00:51:23.713
HAVE PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCES

00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:24.948
EVEN THOUGH WE'VE HAD A LOT OF

00:51:25.015 --> 00:51:27.050
COMMON GROUND IN THE PAST. THIS

00:51:27.117 --> 00:51:27.818
IS JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS

00:51:27.884 --> 00:51:29.886
HERE. GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT

00:51:29.953 --> 00:51:31.755
HAVE A ROLE IN FORCING THE

00:51:31.822 --> 00:51:33.523
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION.

00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:35.192
BETWEEN TWO PRIVATE CONTRACTING

00:51:35.258 --> 00:51:38.295
PARTIES ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S

00:51:38.361 --> 00:51:39.896
VOLUNTARY. IF THE SMALL MOM AND

00:51:39.963 --> 00:51:41.131
POP BELIEVES YOU'RE PAYING TOO

00:51:41.198 --> 00:51:44.167
MUCH. TO FOOD DELIVERY SERVICE

00:51:44.234 --> 00:51:45.168
FOR WHAT IS ACTUALLY WHAT WHAT

00:51:45.235 --> 00:51:47.938
PRODUCT IS BEING DELIVERED.

00:51:48.004 --> 00:51:48.538
THEY HAVE EVERY REASON TO STOP

00:51:48.605 --> 00:51:50.740
DOING. AND FOR GOVERNMENT TO

00:51:50.807 --> 00:51:53.243
STEP IN AND IN THESE VERY

00:51:53.310 --> 00:51:55.812
INTIMATE LEVELS OF ENTERPRISE I

00:51:55.879 --> 00:51:58.582

BE HAPPY TO RESPOND NOW I DO

00:52:05.856 --> 00:52:07.090
WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE MY

00:52:07.157 --> 00:52:09.125
PREVIOUS MANAGER ACTUALLY ALSO

00:52:09.192 --> 00:52:10.393
POSED BY THESE COMPANIES WAS TO

00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:11.261
REQUIRE THAT THERE BE A

00:52:11.328 --> 00:52:12.863
CONTRACT BETWEEN THE RESTAURANT

00:52:12.929 --> 00:52:14.231
AND THE FOOD DELIVERY COMPANY.

00:52:14.297 --> 00:52:16.967
IN ORDER FOR THE FOOD DELIVERY

00:52:17.033 --> 00:52:19.202
COMPANY TO AT. TO PROVIDE THE

00:52:19.269 --> 00:52:21.505
SERVICE- THE STATE DOES HAVE A

00:52:21.571 --> 00:52:22.172
REASONABLE INTEREST IN

00:52:22.239 --> 00:52:23.507
INFORMING CONSUMERS AND BEEN

00:52:23.573 --> 00:52:25.242
BUSINESS SAYS OF THE NATURE OF

00:52:25.308 --> 00:52:26.476
THE RELATIONSHIP PARTICULARLY

00:52:26.543 --> 00:52:27.277
IN THE- ORIGINS AND

00:52:27.344 --> 00:52:28.512
DESTINATIONS THEIR MONEY IN THE

00:52:28.578 --> 00:52:29.246
SCOPE OF A BUSINESS

00:52:29.312 --> 00:52:30.914
TRANSACTION. I'D EVEN ARGUE

00:52:30.981 --> 00:52:32.315
FURTHER NUMBER ONE THIS IS IN

00:52:32.382 --> 00:52:33.650
PLACE IN CERTAIN CITIES ARE

00:52:33.717 --> 00:52:36.186
READY. SO IT'S NOT. THE FIRST

00:52:36.253 --> 00:52:37.254
UP WE ACTUALLY TOOK IT FROM

00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:40.590
OTHER- LANGUAGE AND IN. METRO

00:52:40.657 --> 00:52:44.261
AREAS- BUT I'D ALSO ARGUE THIS.

00:52:44.327 --> 00:52:45.862
THIS IS A UNIQUE SITUATION

00:52:45.929 --> 00:52:47.130
RIGHT WE HAVE COMPANIES QUITE

00:52:47.197 --> 00:52:49.599
FRANKLY. THAT SOLD THE PUBLIC-

00:52:49.666 --> 00:52:52.002
ON THEIR GENERAL BENEFIT TO THE

00:52:52.068 --> 00:52:53.937
PUBLIC- WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT

00:52:54.004 --> 00:52:55.472
HAVE BEEN TRUE. THEY ARE

00:52:55.539 --> 00:52:56.773
COMPANIES THAT BECAUSE THEIR

00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:58.441
BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS- AND

00:52:58.508 --> 00:52:59.342
BECAUSE THE WAY THEY CONDUCT

00:52:59.409 --> 00:53:01.344
BUSINESS WE AS TAXPAYERS ARE

00:53:01.411 --> 00:53:03.880
ACTUALLY SUBSIDIZING- THEIR

00:53:03.947 --> 00:53:05.448
WORKFORCE. SO I THINK IT'S

00:53:05.515 --> 00:53:07.584
IMPERATIVE FOR- GENERAL

00:53:07.651 --> 00:53:08.952
EDUCATION OF CONSUMERS TO

00:53:09.019 --> 00:53:11.621
UNDERSTAND THE EXACT NATURE. OF

00:53:11.688 --> 00:53:13.690
HOW MUCH MONEY IS BEING- TAKEN

00:53:13.757 --> 00:53:15.692
IN BY THESE COMPANIES. BLESSED

00:53:15.759 --> 00:53:16.826
HOW MUCH IS ACTUALLY BEING PAID

00:53:16.893 --> 00:53:18.361
TO THE DRIVERS QUITE FRANKLY ON

00:53:18.428 --> 00:53:19.496
THAT'S A DIFFERENT DISCUSSION.

00:53:19.563 --> 00:53:23.833
BUT BUT- TO KNOW THAT- DELIVER

00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:26.069
IS NOT FREE RIGHT I MEAN THIS

00:53:26.136 --> 00:53:28.238
NOTION THAT THAT SOMEHOW. SOME

00:53:28.305 --> 00:53:30.574
COMPANY IS PAIN HEY'RE NOT

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:32.208
PAIN BY THE WAY- YOU KNOW

00:53:32.275 --> 00:53:33.610
MINIMUM WAGE OR OR THE EVEN

00:53:33.677 --> 00:53:34.811
REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY- THEY

00:53:34.878 --> 00:53:36.813
PROVIDED POP TWENTY TWO I THINK

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:38.982
FULL DISCLOSURE SOMETHING THAT-

00:53:39.049 --> 00:53:40.417
WE AS CONSUMERS DESERVE

00:53:40.483 --> 00:53:42.152
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE AS CONSUMERS

00:53:42.218 --> 00:53:43.653

GOOD PRODUCT AS WELL AS HOW HOW

00:53:49.826 --> 00:53:51.494
GOOD THEY ARE FOR RESTAURANTS

00:53:51.561 --> 00:53:52.062
HOW GOOD THEY ARE FOR THEIR

00:53:52.128 --> 00:53:53.763
DRIVERS AND I THINK. HAVING

00:53:53.830 --> 00:53:54.965
DISCLOSURE ON BUSINESS

00:53:55.031 --> 00:53:56.466

GOING IT IS A FAIR. A NEXT STEP.

00:54:00.670 --> 00:54:02.105

00:54:10.981 --> 00:54:12.449
MAINLY BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK

00:54:12.515 --> 00:54:13.950
THAT WAS A THAT WAS A CLOSING

00:54:14.017 --> 00:54:15.585
THERE THERE ARE SOME MERITS I

00:54:15.652 --> 00:54:18.388

NOW TO FIGURE OUT THE REAL

00:54:36.439 --> 00:54:37.774
DISTINCTION. AND I WAS

00:54:37.841 --> 00:54:40.010
DISINCLINED TO ACTUALLY GO FOR

00:54:40.076 --> 00:54:41.244
THE FOOD DELIVERY SERVICE

00:54:41.311 --> 00:54:42.045
BECAUSE IT WAS THAT MUCH MORE

00:54:42.112 --> 00:54:44.981
EXPENSIVE. BUT THAT'S MY CHOICE.

00:54:45.048 --> 00:54:48.218

00:54:48.284 --> 00:54:50.286

TWO PARTIES I CAN MAKE A

00:54:56.359 --> 00:54:57.927
DECISION. THAT IT'S TOO

00:54:57.994 --> 00:54:59.929
EXPENSIVE OR I PREFER TO DO

00:54:59.996 --> 00:55:01.665
TAKEOUT BUT TO FORCE THESE

00:55:01.731 --> 00:55:03.133
INDIVIDUALS TO DISCLOSE

00:55:03.199 --> 00:55:06.136
PROPRIETARY INFORMATION ON

00:55:06.202 --> 00:55:08.071
THEIR RELATIONSHIP. IS WELL

00:55:08.138 --> 00:55:11.574
BEYOND THE REALM OF THE STATE

00:55:11.641 --> 00:55:12.542
AND EVEN THOUGH THERE MAY BE

00:55:12.609 --> 00:55:14.711

00:56:09.666 --> 00:56:11.568
THE SCALE OF IT AND I THINK

00:56:11.634 --> 00:56:13.069

00:56:13.136 --> 00:56:13.970

THE APPROPRIATE TIME- D. THE

00:56:35.125 --> 00:56:36.459
AUTHORS NOT JUST THE

00:56:36.526 --> 00:56:39.395
PRESENTATION THE BILL BUT THE

00:56:39.462 --> 00:56:41.564
COLLEGE WE HAD HERE THING WAS.

00:56:41.631 --> 00:56:43.600
ILLUMINATING AND I AND I JUST.

00:56:43.666 --> 00:56:47.504
THIS THIS NOTION THAT SOMEHOW-

00:56:47.570 --> 00:56:49.472
FEED DISCLOSURE SERVICE FEE

00:56:49.539 --> 00:56:51.941
DISCLOSURE WOULD BE SEEN AS

00:56:52.008 --> 00:56:53.643
ANTI COMPETITIVE OR SOMEHOW

00:56:53.710 --> 00:56:56.146
UNDERCUTTING- YOU KNOW BUSINESS

00:56:56.212 --> 00:56:58.581
PROPRIETARY INFORMATION TO ME

00:56:58.648 --> 00:57:00.617
IT IT THERE'S SO MANY OTHER

00:57:00.683 --> 00:57:03.419
SECTORS WHERE WE REQUIRE.

00:57:03.486 --> 00:57:05.388
SERVICE FEES AND COMMISSION

00:57:05.455 --> 00:57:07.390
DISCLOSURES THIS IS NOT I DON'T

00:57:07.457 --> 00:57:08.291
THINK WE'RE BREAKING SOME

00:57:08.358 --> 00:57:10.026
DRAMATIC NEW GROUND HERE IN

00:57:10.093 --> 00:57:11.828
FACT AND IT AND I THINK IT'S

00:57:11.895 --> 00:57:13.763
IMPORTANT GROUND BREAK BUT I

00:57:13.830 --> 00:57:15.598
DON'T THINK IT'S NEW GROUND-

00:57:15.665 --> 00:57:17.700
AND SO YOU KNOW I THINK ABOUT.

00:57:17.767 --> 00:57:18.835
OTHER MAJOR TRANSACTIONS WE

00:57:18.902 --> 00:57:21.504

RETAIL TRANSACTIONS THAT OCCUR-

00:57:25.675 --> 00:57:28.978
SO I THINK I DON'T SEE THIS AS

00:57:29.045 --> 00:57:30.914
PARTICULARLY REVOLUTIONARY

00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:32.882
CONTROVERSIAL BUT JUST A MATTER

00:57:32.949 --> 00:57:34.717
OF SIMPLE TRANSPARENCY AND

00:57:34.784 --> 00:57:38.021

AND SEEING WHAT A STRUGGLE IT

00:57:43.793 --> 00:57:45.094
IS TO SURVIVE AND SEEING HOW

00:57:45.161 --> 00:57:46.763
MANY PEOPLE THAT I KNOW. WHO

00:57:46.830 --> 00:57:48.698
ARE UPSIDE DOWN RIGHT NOW AT

00:57:48.765 --> 00:57:50.934
LEAST WE CAN DO IS JUST TRY TO

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.936

01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:59.822
WITH THE BASIC NOTION THAT A

01:05:59.889 --> 01:06:01.390
RESIDENT IN A MOBILE HOME PARK

01:06:01.457 --> 01:06:02.725
SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY MORE FOR

01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:04.427
WATER SERVICE THAN THEY WOULD

01:06:04.493 --> 01:06:05.695
IF THEY WERE SERVED DIRECTLY BY

01:06:05.761 --> 01:06:08.064
WATER UTILITY. THE ISSUE WITH

01:06:08.130 --> 01:06:09.332
AB TEN SIXTY ONE IS THAT IT

01:06:09.398 --> 01:06:10.599
PROHIBITS A PART OWNER FROM

01:06:10.666 --> 01:06:12.234
RECOVERING A FIXED COST OF

01:06:12.301 --> 01:06:14.337
SERVICES AT THE SAME RATE

01:06:14.403 --> 01:06:16.172
THAT'S BEEN SET BY A UTILITY

01:06:16.238 --> 01:06:17.940
AND PARKS DEFINITELY HAVE FIXED

01:06:18.007 --> 01:06:20.042
COST MEMBERS IN A PARK UNLIKE

01:06:20.109 --> 01:06:21.410
AN APARTMENT YOU HAVE A WHOLE

01:06:21.477 --> 01:06:22.578
WATER SYSTEM THAT STRETCHES

01:06:22.645 --> 01:06:23.713
BEHIND YOUR MASTER METER TO

01:06:23.779 --> 01:06:27.283
DELIVER WATER ACROSS THE PARK

01:06:27.350 --> 01:06:28.084
THERE MEANS. BEAR UNDER A ROSE

01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:29.885
IN THE PARK EXCAVATING THEM FOR

01:06:29.952 --> 01:06:31.454
OPERATIONS MAINTENANCE AND

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:33.589
REPAIR IT'S POSSIBLY. AND THE

01:06:33.656 --> 01:06:34.824
WAY THAT THE PARK IS ALLOWED TO

01:06:34.890 --> 01:06:36.392
RECOVER THESE COSTS TODAY IS TO

01:06:36.459 --> 01:06:38.227
LOOK TO THE LOCAL UTILITY. SEE

01:06:38.294 --> 01:06:39.562
HOW THEY HAVE SENT THEIR

01:06:39.628 --> 01:06:40.529
CHARGES FOR COVERING THEIR

01:06:40.596 --> 01:06:43.432
FIXED COSTS. AND USE THAT AND

01:06:43.499 --> 01:06:45.568
KNOW MORE AS A BENCHMARK FOR

01:06:45.634 --> 01:06:46.135
WHAT THE PARK IS ALLOWED TO

01:06:46.202 --> 01:06:48.537
RECOVER. AND SO AGAIN. THOSE

01:06:48.604 --> 01:06:49.705
ARE THOSE ARE CHARGES THAT

01:06:49.772 --> 01:06:51.507
WOULD BE PAID BY A RESIDENT IF

01:06:51.574 --> 01:06:52.274
THEY WERE SERVED DIRECTLY BY

01:06:52.341 --> 01:06:54.076
UTILITY THEY'RE PAID BY ALL OF

01:06:54.143 --> 01:06:55.378
YOUR OTHER CONSTITUENTS WHO ARE

01:06:55.444 --> 01:06:57.146
LIVING IN SINGLE FAMILY HOMES.

01:06:57.213 --> 01:06:58.581
AND THEY ARE NOT SET BY THE

01:06:58.647 --> 01:06:59.815
PARK ITSELF WE DON'T HAVE

01:06:59.882 --> 01:07:01.016
CONTROL OVER IT UNDER THE LAW

01:07:01.083 --> 01:07:02.218
SO WE BELIEVE THAT'S THE RIGHT

01:07:02.284 --> 01:07:03.986
WAY TO GO. BUT THIS BILL

01:07:04.053 --> 01:07:05.020
PROHIBITS IT WOULDN'T KNOW

01:07:05.087 --> 01:07:06.655
WHETHER A MECHANISM IN PLACE

01:07:06.722 --> 01:07:11.761
FOR RECOVERY OF COST. AND YOU.

01:07:11.827 --> 01:07:13.095
IF YOU ARE IN A RENT CONTROLLED

01:07:13.162 --> 01:07:14.764
JURISDICTION YOU ARE AT THE

01:07:14.830 --> 01:07:16.165
MERCY OF A LOCAL RENT CONTROL

01:07:16.232 --> 01:07:17.967
BOARD WITH NO EXPERTISE IN

01:07:18.033 --> 01:07:19.735
WATER SERVICE. WHEN YOU GO TO

01:07:19.802 --> 01:07:21.203
THEM AND ASK THEM TO ALLOW YOU

01:07:21.270 --> 01:07:22.538
TO RECOVER THIS. THAT'S

01:07:22.605 --> 01:07:24.039
ESPECIALLY PROBLEMATIC FOR

01:07:24.106 --> 01:07:26.142
PARKS THE TWENTY YEARS AGO.

01:07:26.208 --> 01:07:28.177
MADE A CHOICE TO REDUCE THEIR

01:07:28.244 --> 01:07:30.112
RENT. TO REFLECT THE FACT THAT

01:07:30.179 --> 01:07:30.946
THEY WOULD BE BILLING

01:07:31.013 --> 01:07:33.349
SEPARATELY FOR UTILITY SERVICE.

01:07:33.416 --> 01:07:34.850
LASTLY MEMBERS THERE IS A

01:07:34.917 --> 01:07:35.951
CONSERVATION ISSUE IN THIS

01:07:36.018 --> 01:07:38.187
BILL. WE METER AND SUB METER

01:07:38.254 --> 01:07:39.522
WATER SERVICE IN CALIFORNIA

01:07:39.588 --> 01:07:40.923
BECAUSE IT ENCOURAGES PEOPLE TO

01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:43.192
USE LESS WATER. IF PARTS ARE

01:07:43.259 --> 01:07:45.127
NOT ALLOWED FULL COST RECOVERY.

01:07:45.194 --> 01:07:46.796
NO OTHER MOBILE HOME PARK GOING

01:07:46.862 --> 01:07:48.764
FORWARD IF THIS BILL PASSES.

01:07:48.831 --> 01:07:50.566
WILL I CHOOSE TO SUB METERED

01:07:50.633 --> 01:07:51.600
WATER SERVICE AND SO FOR ALL

01:07:51.667 --> 01:07:53.536
THESE REASONS. WE REMAIN IN

01:07:53.602 --> 01:07:54.470
OPPOSITION TO THE BILL THERE

01:07:54.537 --> 01:07:56.105
ARE WAYS TO FIX IT WE DISCUSSED

01:07:56.172 --> 01:07:57.640
IT WITH YOUR STAFF. AND ALL OF

01:07:57.706 --> 01:07:59.041

01:08:24.733 --> 01:08:27.736
POTENTIAL AMENDMENTS WE REMAIN

01:08:27.803 --> 01:08:28.270
OPPOSED FOR THE FOLLOWING

01:08:28.337 --> 01:08:32.141

ONE SIMPLE CLARIFYING

01:08:42.218 --> 01:08:45.254
AMENDMENTS. AND THAT WAS TO

ALLOW THOSE DELIVERING WATER TO

01:08:47.356 --> 01:08:50.826
GET REIMBURSED FOR THAT SERVICE

01:08:50.893 --> 01:08:53.596
NO MORE NO LESS. THAT

01:08:53.662 --> 01:08:55.631
SUGGESTION WAS NOT ACCEPTED THE

01:08:55.698 --> 01:08:56.999
MOBILE HOME PARK OWNERS HAVE

01:08:57.066 --> 01:08:58.501
BEEN SENT ME DURING WATER AND

HOME PARKS LIKE APARTMENT

01:09:16.185 --> 01:09:18.721
BUILDINGS. MOBILE HOME PARKS

01:09:18.787 --> 01:09:19.855
ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM

APARTMENTS AND THEIR WATER

01:09:21.824 --> 01:09:23.792

01:09:59.428 --> 01:10:01.163
WHY LOCAL RENT CONTROL BOARDS

01:10:01.230 --> 01:10:02.064

01:13:03.645 --> 01:13:04.413
KIND OF FIXED COSTS THAT HAVE

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:05.948
BEEN PUT IN THAT. WOULD BE

01:13:06.014 --> 01:13:08.016

01:13:12.488 --> 01:13:13.522
SIR FOR THE QUESTION I MEAN

01:13:13.589 --> 01:13:15.991
DEFER TO BRUCE STAND. THE LEGAL

01:13:16.058 --> 01:13:16.492
COUNSEL WHICH IS OFTEN A

01:13:16.558 --> 01:13:21.396
QUESTION. YEAH I'D BE HAPPY TO

01:13:21.463 --> 01:13:23.499
TRY TO RESPOND IT IS THE ISSUE

01:13:23.565 --> 01:13:25.567
HERE IS REALLY JUST A LACK OF

01:13:25.634 --> 01:13:28.437
REGULATION. AS LONG AS THE PARK

01:13:28.504 --> 01:13:29.705
OWNER CHARGES THE SAME

01:13:29.772 --> 01:13:32.674
VOLUMETRIC RATE AS IT PAYS AS

01:13:32.741 --> 01:13:34.743
THE WATER PURVEYOR AUTHORIZES

01:13:34.810 --> 01:13:37.679
THE CPUC HAS NO JURISDICTION

01:13:37.746 --> 01:13:38.280
AND THAT THERE IS NO

01:13:38.347 --> 01:13:40.415
REGULATION. REGARDING THIS

01:13:40.482 --> 01:13:42.284
RECURRING FIXED CHARGE ISSUES

01:13:42.351 --> 01:13:44.052
SUCH AS THE CUSTOMER CHARGES

01:13:44.119 --> 01:13:45.320
THAT ARE BEING REPLICATED

01:13:45.387 --> 01:13:47.389
THROUGHOUT THE PARKS. AND SO

01:13:47.456 --> 01:13:48.624
THE RESIDENTS REALLY HAVE NO

01:13:48.690 --> 01:13:51.693
REMEDY IF THOSE CHARGES ARE

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:53.729
INCORRECT OR IF THEY'RE JUST

01:13:53.796 --> 01:13:56.098
RAISING CONTINUE TO BE

01:13:56.165 --> 01:13:58.066
REPLICATED. SO THE PROBLEM HERE

01:13:58.133 --> 01:13:59.635
IS IN THE FAR CORNER HERE

01:13:59.701 --> 01:14:02.171
SAYING WELL WE NEED THIS COST

01:14:02.237 --> 01:14:04.273
TO MAINTAIN THE INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:14:04.339 --> 01:14:05.808
BUT IN FACT WHAT HAPPENS IS

01:14:05.874 --> 01:14:07.342
MANY PARK OWNERS WILL CHARGE

01:14:07.409 --> 01:14:09.111
THE RESIDENT TO INSTALL THE

01:14:09.178 --> 01:14:10.512
METERS WHEN WATER IS FOR

01:14:10.579 --> 01:14:12.648
SENATOR. THEN THE REPLICATING

01:14:12.714 --> 01:14:14.049
THE CUSTOMER CHARGE THAT

01:14:14.116 --> 01:14:15.284
THEY'RE NOT ACCOUNTING FOR IT

01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:17.252
THERE'S NO REGULATION THAT SAYS

01:14:17.319 --> 01:14:19.021
YOU HAVE TO BANK BACK CUSTOMER

01:14:19.087 --> 01:14:23.125
CHARGE OR OTHERWISE. THAT COUNT

01:14:23.192 --> 01:14:24.193
FOR HER BUT SHE'S ACCUMULATED.

01:14:24.259 --> 01:14:25.828
AND THEN WHEN THERE IS A REPAIR

01:14:25.894 --> 01:14:27.396
OR MAINTENANCE ISSUE WITH THE

01:14:27.462 --> 01:14:30.365
SYSTEM THE PARKING IS FREE. TO

01:14:30.432 --> 01:14:32.267
PASS THAT THROUGH TO RESIDENTS

01:14:32.334 --> 01:14:34.803
AS A CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT AND

01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:35.871
THAT TYPICALLY HAPPENS BASED

01:14:35.938 --> 01:14:38.841
UPON. WHAT LEASES AUTHORIZE

01:14:38.907 --> 01:14:41.543
VERY COMMONLY OR- IN LOCAL RENT

01:14:41.610 --> 01:14:43.378
CONTROL JURISDICTIONS THERE ARE

01:14:43.445 --> 01:14:45.214
MANY TIMES SEPARATE CAPITAL

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:46.448
IMPROVEMENT PASS THROUGH

01:14:46.515 --> 01:14:48.884
PROVISIONS THAT ALLOW. ANY KIND

01:14:48.951 --> 01:14:50.452
OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURE TO BE

01:14:50.519 --> 01:14:52.588
REIMBURSED SO REALLY HAD

01:14:52.654 --> 01:14:54.957
NOTHING TO DO WITH RANCH- IT'S

01:14:55.023 --> 01:14:58.360
ALL ABOUT A CAPITAL EXPENDITURE

01:14:58.427 --> 01:14:59.962
CHARGE. PROBABLY FOR YOU AT THE

01:15:00.028 --> 01:15:01.763
PARK UNDER GETS TO REPLICATE

01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:03.332
THIS CUSTOMER CHARGE EVERY

01:15:03.398 --> 01:15:05.100
STATE AND I'M NOT ACCOUNTABLE

01:15:05.167 --> 01:15:06.735
AT. THE PARK AND JEFF

01:15:06.802 --> 01:15:08.203
COLLECTING NOT ONLY THIS

01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:10.539
CUSTOMER CHARGE BUT ALSO CAN GO

01:15:10.606 --> 01:15:13.375
COLLECT. THE CAPITAL COST TO

01:15:13.442 --> 01:15:14.776
REPAIR OR MAINTAIN THE

01:15:14.843 --> 01:15:16.712
INFRASTRUCTURE. I THINK THE

01:15:16.778 --> 01:15:18.013
CUSTOMER CHARGES CERTAINLY

01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:19.181
INTENDED FROM THE SERVING

01:15:19.248 --> 01:15:20.916
UTILITY OR WATER PURVEYORS

01:15:20.983 --> 01:15:22.384
POINT IF YOU COULD BE A BETTER

01:15:22.451 --> 01:15:26.722
STRANGERS COSTS- AND THAT'S

01:15:26.788 --> 01:15:28.156
WHAT THIS BILL. AS WE YOU KNOW

01:15:28.223 --> 01:15:29.091
TOOK THE PROVISIONS OF THE

01:15:29.157 --> 01:15:31.159
FORMER SP SEVEN IS ALLOWED TO

01:15:31.226 --> 01:15:32.928
PARK ON. YOUR RECUPERATED

01:15:32.995 --> 01:15:35.264
MINISTRATION COSTS BUT NOT TO

01:15:35.330 --> 01:15:38.400
REPLICATE THE CUSTOMER. CHARGE

01:15:38.467 --> 01:15:41.203
WERE- NON RECURRING FIXED

01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:43.171
CHARGES WERE ACTUALLY A

01:15:43.238 --> 01:15:45.407
RECURRING FIXED CHARGES. THAT

01:15:45.474 --> 01:15:49.244
THE WATER PURVEYOR CHARGES AND

01:15:49.311 --> 01:15:50.078
I ANSWERED THE QUESTION. HEY

01:15:50.145 --> 01:15:51.747
YOU PROBABLY HAVE I CAN'T SAY

01:15:51.813 --> 01:15:52.814
THAT I FOLLOWED IT TOTALLY ME

01:15:52.881 --> 01:15:55.350
JUST SAY THAT. TO THE EXTENT I

01:15:55.417 --> 01:15:56.652
REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE

01:15:56.718 --> 01:15:58.654
TRYING TO DO IN THIS BILL. THIS

01:15:58.720 --> 01:15:59.721
IS THE SECOND HOUSE IF THERE'S

01:15:59.788 --> 01:16:00.989
GONNA BE ANY CHANGES TO THE

01:16:01.056 --> 01:16:02.224
BILL THIS IS THE TIME TO DO IT

01:16:02.291 --> 01:16:03.258
AND THAT THE THING THAT I FEEL

01:16:03.325 --> 01:16:05.060
UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT IS THAT

01:16:05.127 --> 01:16:07.062
WHAT WE WANT IS SEPARATE

01:16:07.129 --> 01:16:10.866
METERING. ON ALL RESIDENCES AND

01:16:10.933 --> 01:16:12.267
THAT INCLUDES MOBILE HOME PARK

01:16:12.334 --> 01:16:14.836
OWNERS SO THAT PEOPLE KNOW WHAT

01:16:14.903 --> 01:16:16.672
THEY'RE USING. AND WHEN WE ASK

01:16:16.738 --> 01:16:19.408
PEOPLE TO REDUCE. THEIR

01:16:19.474 --> 01:16:21.543
CONSUMPTION TO CONSERVE THEY

01:16:21.610 --> 01:16:22.711
HAVE A WAY TO BE ABLE T

01:16:22.778 --> 01:16:23.946
DETERMINE WHETHER THEY'RE DOING

01:16:24.012 --> 01:16:25.480
A GOOD JOB OR NOT IT'S A AS AN

01:16:25.547 --> 01:16:27.549
EXAMPLE. HERE IN SACRAMENTO THE

01:16:27.616 --> 01:16:28.417
RESIDENTS THAT I'VE BEEN LIVING

01:16:28.483 --> 01:16:29.685
IN USED TO BE A FLAT FEET

01:16:29.751 --> 01:16:32.321
BASICALLY FIFTY BUCKS. A MONTH

01:16:32.387 --> 01:16:33.488
FOR THE WATER AND THERE USED TO

01:16:33.555 --> 01:16:35.457
BE WATER RUNNING DOWN THE CURB

01:16:35.524 --> 01:16:37.960
IN FRONT OF MY RESIDENCE. EVERY

01:16:38.026 --> 01:16:39.861
SINGLE DAY FROM SOMEONE ELSE.

01:16:39.928 --> 01:16:41.530
UP THE STREET WHO WAS PROBABLY

01:16:41.596 --> 01:16:44.199
ALSO PAYING FIFTY BUCKS WHEN IT

01:16:44.266 --> 01:16:45.734
FINALLY GOT METERED MY BILL

01:16:45.801 --> 01:16:47.703
WENT DOWN TO BETWEEN TWENTY

01:16:47.769 --> 01:16:48.704
FIVE DOLLARS TO THIRTY FIVE

01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:50.105
DOLLARS A MONTH. SO I'M

01:16:50.172 --> 01:16:51.673
ASSUMING THAT THERE IS WIND UP.

01:16:51.740 --> 01:16:53.041
SIGNIFICANTLY BECAUSE THEY WERE

01:16:53.108 --> 01:16:54.843
WASTING WATER WE WANT PEOPLE TO

01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:55.844
KNOW WHEN THEY'RE WASTING WATER

01:16:55.911 --> 01:16:58.246
AND TO CONSERVE. AND SO IN IN

01:16:58.313 --> 01:17:00.949
THIS SCENARIO I AGREE WITH THE

01:17:01.016 --> 01:17:02.184
OPPONENTS AND I THINK IT'S

01:17:02.250 --> 01:17:05.120
GOING TO DISCOURAGE. B.

01:17:05.187 --> 01:17:07.089
EXPENDITURE OF INFRASTRUCTURE

01:17:07.155 --> 01:17:08.490
MONEY TO SEPARATELY METER

01:17:08.557 --> 01:17:10.225
EVERYTHING WHICH IS STATE LINE

01:17:10.292 --> 01:17:12.294
WHICH WE WANT THEM TO DO. AND

01:17:12.361 --> 01:17:13.061
IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE SETTING

01:17:13.128 --> 01:17:17.666
UP. AN A. STRUCTURE- IT SEEMS

01:17:17.733 --> 01:17:20.969
ONLY FAIR TO ALLOW THOSE- PARK

01:17:21.036 --> 01:17:22.137
OWNERS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:17:22.204 --> 01:17:23.605
PROGRESSIVE AND GONE OUT AND

01:17:23.672 --> 01:17:27.342
DONE THE WORK. TO BE ABLE TO

01:17:27.409 --> 01:17:28.477
RECOUP. THAT INVESTMENT THAT

01:17:28.543 --> 01:17:31.046
THEY MADE IN THE PARK. AND AND

01:17:31.113 --> 01:17:32.647
CHARGER FEE WHICH THEY THEN CAN

01:17:32.714 --> 01:17:35.350
PUT IN A SEPARATE ACCOUNT. AND

01:17:35.417 --> 01:17:38.587
END USE IT ONLY. TO MAKE

01:17:38.653 --> 01:17:41.423
UPGRADES IN TO FIX THE SYSTEM-

01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:43.825
CAPITAL COSTS TO THE SYSTEM AND

01:17:43.892 --> 01:17:45.494
AN ACCOUNT FOR IT TO THE

01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:47.362
BENEFIT OF THE TENANT SO I GET

01:17:47.429 --> 01:17:48.463
TO THE EXTENT THAT. THAT YOU'RE

01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:50.232
CHANGING THE SYSTEM AND THEN

01:17:50.298 --> 01:17:51.166
YOU'RE CREATING THIS NEW

01:17:51.233 --> 01:17:53.502
SYSTEM. TO ME IT JUST SEEMS

01:17:53.568 --> 01:17:55.404
LIKE IT IT MAKES SENSE TO BE

01:17:55.470 --> 01:17:58.473
ABLE TO ALLOW THEM TO. TO

01:17:58.540 --> 01:18:00.108
RECOUP SOME OF THE COST IN IN

01:18:00.175 --> 01:18:01.943
IN THIS INFRASTRUCTURE AND TO

01:18:02.010 --> 01:18:03.412
DO IT IN A WAY THAT PROVIDES

01:18:03.478 --> 01:18:05.080
NOTICE TO THE TENANTS AND AT

01:18:05.147 --> 01:18:06.748
THE ABILITY FOR THEM TO BE ABLE

01:18:06.815 --> 01:18:07.883
TO FOLLOW HOW MUCH MONEY IS IN

01:18:07.949 --> 01:18:10.452
THIS ACCOUNT. AND FRANKLY THAT

01:18:10.519 --> 01:18:12.521
IF THE MONEY GETS TO BE

01:18:12.587 --> 01:18:13.889
SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH THAT THAT

01:18:13.955 --> 01:18:15.490
THAT CHARGE NO LONGER NEEDS TO

01:18:15.557 --> 01:18:17.726
BE INCLUDED AS PART OF THAT OF

01:18:17.793 --> 01:18:20.195
THE WATER WATER FREE SO. I WILL

01:18:20.262 --> 01:18:21.396
NOT BE SUPPORTING THE BILL

01:18:21.463 --> 01:18:23.565
TODAY BUT- I JUST THINK THAT

01:18:23.632 --> 01:18:25.200
IT'S THAT THERE'S A FAIRNESS

01:18:25.267 --> 01:18:27.102
ISSUE HERE AND- WE NEED TO MAKE

01:18:27.169 --> 01:18:28.336
SURE THAT WE'RE INCENTIVIZING

01:18:28.403 --> 01:18:30.072
PEOPLE TO DO THE RIGHT THING

01:18:30.138 --> 01:18:30.739
WHICH IS TO PUT IN THE SEPARATE

01:18:30.806 --> 01:18:32.774
METERS. THANKS THANK YOU

01:18:32.841 --> 01:18:35.377
SENATOR CAFIERO. A SORT OF LIKE

01:18:35.444 --> 01:18:37.979
ASKING. RESEARCHER I'M ON PAGE

01:18:38.046 --> 01:18:39.381
SEVEN OF THE STAFF ALICE'S AND

WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH AND

01:39:08.242 --> 01:39:09.643
PROBABLY AND THAT IS WHY WE'VE

01:39:09.710 --> 01:39:10.611
NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET ANYTHING

01:39:10.678 --> 01:39:12.646
DONE WE WERE BOUGHT BY A

01:39:12.713 --> 01:39:14.948

PROPERTY THAT WAS ALMOST

01:39:24.224 --> 01:39:25.693
IMPOSSIBLE AND THE ONLY WAY

01:39:25.759 --> 01:39:26.727
THAT THAT COULD BE DONE WITH

01:39:26.794 --> 01:39:28.562
THE GALS THE CURRENT DENTURES

01:39:28.629 --> 01:39:30.197

CONTENT CAN FIGURE AT THE TABLE

01:39:34.768 --> 01:39:35.202
AND WE HAVE QUITE A FEW

01:39:35.269 --> 01:39:37.171
VETERANS IN HERE WE'VE HAD

01:39:37.237 --> 01:39:42.710
PEOPLE HERE THAT ARE. SO

01:39:42.776 --> 01:39:43.277
TERRIFIED ABOUT LOSING THEIR

01:39:43.344 --> 01:39:44.645
HOMES. D. FOR READ. AND SOLD A

01:39:44.712 --> 01:39:45.713

01:39:51.085 --> 01:39:52.019
THAT'S RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO

01:39:52.086 --> 01:39:53.253
LESSEN THE CHANCE TO GET HIT BY

01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:54.254

HAD NO PLACE ELSE. TO GO IF SHE

01:39:57.691 --> 01:39:59.493
LOST HER HOME. WE HAVE NOT BEEN

01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:00.527
ABLE TO GET ANY KIND OF RENT

01:40:00.594 --> 01:40:01.662

01:40:02.930 --> 01:40:03.797

01:52:36.416 --> 01:52:37.650
FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH

01:52:37.717 --> 01:52:39.085

SOMEBODY'S LIVING ON AND THEN

01:52:46.860 --> 01:52:49.395
TO DOUBLE SOMETIMES THE AMOUNT

01:52:49.462 --> 01:52:51.831

01:52:51.898 --> 01:52:53.533
MEANSAS WE'VE HEARD IN THESE

01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:55.101
ARE NOT DRAMATIC TESTIMONIES

01:52:55.168 --> 01:52:57.403
ARE ABSOLUTELY THE TRUTH OF

01:52:57.470 --> 01:52:59.472
SOMEBODY DECIDING CAN THEY-

01:52:59.539 --> 01:53:01.141

01:53:01.207 --> 01:53:04.077
THEY AFFORD. FOR MILLS AND SO

01:53:04.144 --> 01:53:05.812
FORTH BUT CERTAINLY WE KNOW

01:53:05.879 --> 01:53:07.614
PROPERTY TAX IN ORANGE COUNTY

01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:10.049
IS CERTAINLY VERY EXPENSIVE SO

01:53:10.116 --> 01:53:11.684
I UNDERSTAND THAT FROM THE PARK

01:53:11.751 --> 01:53:13.620
OWNER BUT THEY ALSO UNDERSTOOD

01:53:13.686 --> 01:53:15.555
UNDERSTOOD THE TYPE OF PROPERTY

01:53:15.622 --> 01:53:16.823
THEY WERE BUYING AND WHAT THAT

01:53:16.890 --> 01:53:18.625
WOULD LOOK LIKE. AND THIS IS

01:53:18.691 --> 01:53:20.460
NOT THE FIRST TIME THE SPECIFIC

01:53:20.527 --> 01:53:22.462
PARK OWNER HAS DONE THIS WHICH

01:53:22.529 --> 01:53:24.764
IS BY A PARK AND IT NOW SINCE

01:53:24.831 --> 01:53:29.302
ESCALATE- THE RENTS IN A VERY

01:53:29.369 --> 01:53:30.036
DRAMATIC FASHION. THANK YOU

01:53:30.103 --> 01:53:31.237
DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION

01:53:31.304 --> 01:53:33.273
SIR WHAT ELSE WELL I GUESS I MY

01:53:33.339 --> 01:53:35.241
UNDERSTANDING OF FOURTEEN

01:53:35.308 --> 01:53:37.744
EIGHTY TWO- WAS TO LIMIT PRICE

01:53:37.810 --> 01:53:39.846
GOUGING SO I DON'T KNOW IT

01:53:39.913 --> 01:53:40.680
SEEMS THAT THERE'S AN

01:53:40.747 --> 01:53:43.249
INTERCEDING- PIECE OF

01:53:43.316 --> 01:53:46.986
INFORMATION SOMEBODY MAY HAVE

01:53:47.053 --> 01:53:48.421
THIS IS. A COMMERCIAL PROPERTY

01:53:48.488 --> 01:53:50.490
OR MOBILE HOME PARK THAT WAS

01:53:50.557 --> 01:53:52.525
ASSESSED IN NINETEEN FIFTY

01:53:52.592 --> 01:53:53.293
EIGHT AND THEN THEY GET SUCCESS

01:53:53.359 --> 01:53:55.195
IN TWENTY NINETEEN THERE'S A

01:53:55.261 --> 01:53:58.364
BIG PRICE DIFFERENCE THERE THAT

01:53:58.431 --> 01:54:00.366
WHETHER THE- NEW PROPERTY TAXES

CRITICAL TO RESIDENT CARE IT'S

02:01:52.705 --> 02:01:54.073
THE NUMBER ONE VARIABLE FOR

CARE IS GOING TO BE GOOD OR

02:01:56.342 --> 02:01:58.310
BAD. NOT SURPRISINGLY THERE'S A

02:01:58.377 --> 02:01:59.845
STRONG CORRELATION BETWEEN

THERE BECAME A LIVING NIGHTMARE

02:04:14.146 --> 02:04:17.449
NO ONE RESPONDED TO HIS CALL

02:04:17.516 --> 02:04:19.151

02:04:23.556 --> 02:04:27.126
FECES. NURSING HOME STAFF WOULD

02:04:27.193 --> 02:04:28.961
LEAVE HIM SITTING ON A BED PAN

02:04:29.028 --> 02:04:31.397
TELLING HIM TO PRESS THE CALL

02:04:31.463 --> 02:04:33.732
LIGHT WHEN HE WAS DONE. HE TOLD

02:04:33.799 --> 02:04:36.001
ME THAT HIS BOTTOM HURT AND WE

02:04:36.068 --> 02:04:37.736

THREE MONTHS. I FELT HELPLESS

02:04:43.175 --> 02:04:45.144
AND CAN'T IMAGINE HOW MY FATHER

02:04:45.211 --> 02:04:47.546
MUST HAVE FELT. WE WENT TO

02:04:47.613 --> 02:04:50.015
TRIAL AGAINST THE NURSING HOME

02:04:50.082 --> 02:04:52.117
THE JURY FOUND THAT MANORCARE

02:04:52.184 --> 02:04:56.488
VIOLATED MY FATHER'S RIGHTS.

02:04:56.555 --> 02:04:57.790
THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO TIMES.

02:04:57.857 --> 02:04:59.625
I FELT THAT THE JURY HEARD MY

02:04:59.692 --> 02:05:02.027
FATHER THAT DAY BUT MY FEELING

02:05:02.094 --> 02:05:03.896
THAT JUSTICE WAS DELIVERED WAS

02:05:03.963 --> 02:05:06.999
SHORT LIVED I WAS SURPRISED AND

02:05:07.066 --> 02:05:09.235
SADDENED TO LEARN THAT LAST

02:05:09.301 --> 02:05:10.769
YEAR THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME

02:05:10.836 --> 02:05:13.239

DOWN TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS.

02:05:21.080 --> 02:05:22.781
IT PAINS ME TO THINK THAT THE

02:05:22.848 --> 02:05:24.750
NURSING HOME COULD VIOLATE MY%

02:05:24.817 --> 02:05:27.419

02:05:37.696 --> 02:05:38.497
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. IT ANGERS

02:05:38.564 --> 02:05:40.666
ME TO THINK THAT NURSING HOMES

02:05:40.733 --> 02:05:42.801
WILL GET AWAY WITH THIS WITH

02:05:42.868 --> 02:05:44.570

TREATED WITH INDIGNITY AS IF HE

02:05:59.618 --> 02:06:01.287
WERE LESS THAN HUMAN. I ALSO

02:06:01.353 --> 02:06:03.188

02:14:52.818 --> 02:14:54.853
MISTER CHAIR- JUST TO GET SOME

02:14:54.920 --> 02:14:56.855
CLARIFICATION THOUGH. I GUESS

02:14:56.922 --> 02:15:00.692
I'M- I'M PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE

02:15:00.759 --> 02:15:03.028
TO. WHAT MAY BE SEEMINGLY

02:15:03.094 --> 02:15:04.729
TECHNICAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE

02:15:04.796 --> 02:15:08.500
VIOLATIONS THAT CUMULATIVELY

02:15:08.567 --> 02:15:11.002
OVER TIME TO RESULT IN

02:15:11.069 --> 02:15:13.171
SIGNIFICANT HARM TO THE PATIENT

02:15:13.238 --> 02:15:14.940
SO SOME OF THE EXAMPLES BROUGHT

02:15:15.006 --> 02:15:16.942
UP I THINK BY DR STEINBERG FOR

02:15:17.008 --> 02:15:18.443
INSTANCE LIKE THE MEALS NOT

02:15:18.510 --> 02:15:20.612
COMING ON TIME WE COULD. WE

02:15:20.679 --> 02:15:21.680
COULD EASILY DISMISS THAT AND

02:15:21.746 --> 02:15:24.216
SAY WELL THEY WERE JUST LATE

02:15:24.282 --> 02:15:25.450
FIVE MINUTES FOR ONE MEAL OR

02:15:25.517 --> 02:15:26.351
THEY DIDN'T BRING AT THAT TIME

02:15:26.418 --> 02:15:28.520
BUT- THERE'S A CUMULATIVE

02:15:28.587 --> 02:15:30.522
IMPACT TO THINGS LIKE. THE

02:15:30.589 --> 02:15:32.757
SIMPLE AS YOU KNOW. GETTING

02:15:32.824 --> 02:15:34.693
SOMEONE HYDRATED WHO DOESN'T

02:15:34.759 --> 02:15:36.294
HAVE FULL FULL USE OF THEIR

02:15:36.361 --> 02:15:39.097
FACULTIES- I HAVE A VERY

02:15:39.164 --> 02:15:40.265
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH THIS

02:15:40.332 --> 02:15:42.000
WERE YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE NOT

02:15:42.067 --> 02:15:44.436
GETTING YOUR SIPPY CUP. FIFTEEN

02:15:44.503 --> 02:15:46.004
TIMES A DAY YOU'RE GOING TO GET

02:15:46.071 --> 02:15:47.739
SO DEHYDRATED THAT YOU DO GET A

02:15:47.806 --> 02:15:49.307
U. TI AND THEN YOU END UP IN

02:15:49.374 --> 02:15:52.344
THE I SEE YOU AND THEN THAT

02:15:52.410 --> 02:15:52.978
COULD BE THE END OF YOU. AND SO

02:15:53.044 --> 02:15:54.713
THOSE. THE DEATH BY A THOUSAND

02:15:54.779 --> 02:15:56.982
CUTS- IS SOMETHING I'M REALLY

02:15:57.048 --> 02:15:58.683
WORRIED ABOUT AND I THINK THAT.

02:15:58.750 --> 02:16:00.418
MAKES THIS BILL SO NECESSARY

02:16:00.485 --> 02:16:02.654
MAKES THE SUPREME COURT

02:16:02.721 --> 02:16:04.289
DECISION SO CONFOUNDING THAT

02:16:04.356 --> 02:16:05.156
THE LEGISLATURE COULD HAVE

02:16:05.223 --> 02:16:06.925
ASSUMED THAT. THAT WAS SORT OF

02:16:06.992 --> 02:16:09.694
THE FULL EXTENT OF JUSTICE THAT

02:16:09.761 --> 02:16:10.862
WE WERE ENVISIONING BACK AT

02:16:10.929 --> 02:16:12.097
THAT TIME BUT I APPRECIATE THE

02:16:12.163 --> 02:16:13.331
AUTHOR'S WORK ON RECTIFYING

02:16:13.398 --> 02:16:15.100
THIS AND I WOULD JUST SAY HE IS

02:16:15.166 --> 02:16:15.734
A CAUTIONARY NOTE GOING FORWARD

02:16:15.800 --> 02:16:19.504
I THINK. NOT TO BE DECEIVED BY

02:16:19.571 --> 02:16:22.674
WHAT MAY SEEM LIKE A- AN

02:16:22.741 --> 02:16:24.042
INFRACTION THAT DOESN'T HAVE A

02:16:24.109 --> 02:16:25.377
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT BUT WHEN

02:16:25.443 --> 02:16:26.745
WE'RE NOT HITTING OUR NURSE TO

02:16:26.811 --> 02:16:27.812

02:16:31.483 --> 02:16:32.584
DON'T MEAN OVER IT SAYS IT'S

02:16:32.651 --> 02:16:33.919
NOT EVERY TIME NOT IF SOMEONE

02:16:33.985 --> 02:16:34.986
DIDN'T SHOW UP FOR THE SHIFT

02:16:35.053 --> 02:16:37.889

AS WAS MENTIONED OVER THE YEARS-

02:17:30.842 --> 02:17:31.710
FOR ONE I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE

02:17:31.776 --> 02:17:33.144
WILL INDEED BE A FLOOD OF

02:17:33.211 --> 02:17:35.347
LITIGATION AGAINST THESE SNAPS

COLLEAGUES I THINK IT'S REALLY

02:18:43.882 --> 02:18:44.983
IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT

02:18:45.050 --> 02:18:47.052

02:18:48.086 --> 02:18:52.390

02:18:52.457 --> 02:18:55.794
