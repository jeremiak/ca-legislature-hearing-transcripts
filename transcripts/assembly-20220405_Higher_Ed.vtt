AT- LOW RISK THAT AREA FROM A

00:50:46.309 --> 00:50:48.178

ADEQUATE RESOURCES THAT WERE

00:50:52.716 --> 00:50:55.786
PROMISED- FOR THE SERVICE- THAT

00:50:55.852 --> 00:50:59.022
NOW HAS A DISABLED VETERAN. WHO

00:50:59.089 --> 00:51:03.026
SERVED OUR COUNTRY. OKAY SO THIS

00:51:03.093 --> 00:51:06.797
BILL- WILL ONLY WAIVE THE

00:51:06.863 --> 00:51:09.065
TUITION AT THIS TIME. IT'S

00:51:09.132 --> 00:51:10.233
GEARED TOWARDS LEAD AND WE'RE

00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:12.002
EVEN EVEN EVEN IF WHEN THEY GET

00:51:12.068 --> 00:51:14.104
THIS SET TUITION WAIVER WHEN

00:51:14.171 --> 00:51:17.107
THEY PSTN ELIGIBLE TO APPLY FOR

00:51:17.174 --> 00:51:20.977
THE EXISTING GRAND SELF FROM THE

00:51:21.044 --> 00:51:22.813
STATE AND THE FEDERAL. IF I

00:51:22.879 --> 00:51:24.714
WITNESSES WANT TO BECAUSE OUT

00:51:24.781 --> 00:51:26.750
WHAT I WAS THE STAND IS THAT

00:51:26.817 --> 00:51:28.151
THEY HAVE A CERTAIN LIMITATIONS

00:51:28.218 --> 00:51:29.319
OF WHEN THEY RECEIVE THE

00:51:29.386 --> 00:51:32.355
SCHOLARSHIPS OR GRANTS SO. THEY

00:51:32.422 --> 00:51:34.391
HAVE A SUDDEN CAPITAL. AND THAT

00:51:34.458 --> 00:51:35.592
THEY CANNOT GET THAT ANY FURTHER

00:51:35.659 --> 00:51:37.727
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE DISPUTE

00:51:37.794 --> 00:51:41.264
OR DISADVANTAGE- IT GIVE A MORE

00:51:41.331 --> 00:51:43.133
DISADVANTAGES THAN NOT HELPING

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:45.602

00:51:45.669 --> 00:51:47.804
A DISADVANTAGE IT WITH EXCEL THE

00:51:47.871 --> 00:51:49.306

EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT. I KNOW

00:51:53.310 --> 00:51:54.878
THIS IS A TARGETED FOR LOW

00:51:54.945 --> 00:51:56.847
INCOME PEOPLE SO WHEN THEY WHEN

00:51:56.913 --> 00:51:58.849
THEY ARE IN THE LOW INCOME

00:51:58.915 --> 00:52:00.951
CATEGORY THEY ALREADY HAVE. A

00:52:01.017 --> 00:52:02.686
PLAN ANY OTHER SOURCES OF
