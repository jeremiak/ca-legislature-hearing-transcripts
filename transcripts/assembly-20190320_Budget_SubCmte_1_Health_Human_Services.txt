THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR CALORIE ACTING DIRECTOR CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- TO HONOR YOUR REQUEST WE ARE GOING TO KEEP OUR OPENING REMARKS EXTREMELY BRIEF -- WE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THIS THIS PROGRAM IS TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THIS IS A LIVE IN HOME SUPPORT SERVICES IS THE LARGEST -- LONG TERM SERVICES FOR PROGRAM IN THE NATION -- AND AS WE GO THIS IS AN EXTRA -- AND FOR THE STATE WITHOUT I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER TO FUTURE BEEN CUT TO GET POSTS THE REST. YEAH THANK YOU MANAGE IT BACK. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TO BE BACK BEFORE YOU TO TALK ABOUT THE PROGRAM TODAY -- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO DO INTRODUCTIONS DOWN THE PANEL OR I CAN DIVE RIGHT IN -- A DIVE RIGHT AND SO TO TWO THINGS -- WE WERE BEFORE THE SENATE ON THE SAME ISSUES LAST LAST WEEK AND I WANT TO MAKE TWO POINTS -- FOR THE PUBLIC BEHIND US SO THAT THERE'S NO CONFUSION -- ABOUT -- WHAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY? IN THE DEPTHS OF THE DAY GREAT RECESSION -- IT BUDGET REDUCTIONS WERE MADE TO THE AYE CHOI SAYS PROGRAM INCLUDING A 7% REDUCTION IN AUTHORIZED HOURS FOR RECIPIENTS. THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION AS THE LAST HAS PROPOSED A GENERAL FUND BACK FILL OF THAT SO THAT THAT REDUCTION IS NOT IMPLEMENTED. THERE IS NO PROPOSAL TO MAKE A BUDGET REDUCTION TO THE I. HSS PROGRAM BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE. THE ISSUE IN THE AGENDA FOR YOU TODAY IS SIMPLY WHETHER THAT REDUCTION IS -- REPEALED OR SUSPENDED Vì ã LÏNG A CHANGE TO THE UNDERLYING STATUTE OF THE PROGRAM BUT I WANT TO BE CRYSTAL CLEAR THERE IS NO PROPOSED REDUCTION -- TO SERVICES IN THE AYE HSS PROGRAM THE SECOND THING THAT I WANT TO MENTION IS FOR US A SUBSEQUENT ITEM IN THE AGENDA RELATED TO ELECTRONIC VISIT VERIFICATION. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A A MOVEMENT NATIONALLY TO OPPOSE THE EMPLOYMENT AND UNTIL IMPLEMENTATION OF ELECTRONIC VISIT VERIFICATION. HOWEVER WHAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA AN OBLIGATION TO COMPLY WITH A FEDERAL LAW. THE LAW ALSO REQUIRES THAT THERE BE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE V. V. AS WELL AS THAT THE V. V. SOLUTION THAT IS IMPLEMENTED AS MINIMALLY BURDENSOME TO CONSUMERS IN THE PROGRAM. A WE'VE ENGAGE WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS IN CALIFORNIA AND ESSENTIALLY ARE PROPOSED IMPLEMENTATION OF ELECTRONIC VISIT VERIFICATION. SIMPLY MOVES THE CURRENT PAPER TIME SHEETS TO EITHER AN INTERNET BASED OR TELEPHONE -- THE SOLUTION. OF FOR TIME SHEET AND CONSUMERS AND PROVIDERS WILL HAVE THE CHOICE OF EITHER THE INTERNET OR THE PHONE -- AT THEIR DISCRETION TO TO USE THAT THERE ARE A COUPLE QUESTIONS THAT ARE GOING TO BE ADDED TO THE TIME SHEET REGARDING -- START TIME AND STOPPED TIME EACH DAY -- AND ALSO THE LOCATION OF WHERE THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED WHICH HAS BEEN THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL WORD BUT IN IN ESSENCE -- WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS THAT PEOPLE BE ALLOWED TO SAY SERVICES WERE PROVIDED AT HOME IN THE COMMUNITY OR BOTH? WE ARE NOT PROPOSING GLOBAL POSITIONING ELECTRONIC LEASH ON PEOPLE AND I WANT TO SAY THAT FOR THE RECORD SO THAT THE AUDIENCE UNDERSTANDS. THE PROPOSAL BEFORE US TODAY -- WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST ITEM ON YOUR AGENDA THE RESTORATION OF THE 7% REDUCTION YOUR AGENDA IS VERY CLEAR ON PAGE FIVE WHAT THE PROPOSAL IS WE PROPOSED A GENERAL FUND. ROUGHLY THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR -- AUGMENTATION TO THE PROGRAM AND WE PROPOSED BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE -- THAT WOULD SUSPEND -- THAT IN ANY IMPOSITION OF A OF A COT -- WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE A PROPOSAL FROM A NUMBER OF PARTIES -- THAT WERE PART OF THAT REDUCTION THAT WOULD CODIFY -- THE ELIMINATION OF THAT REDUCTION -- RATHER THAN DO IT IN THE ANNUAL BUDGET ACT AND WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE MERITS ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR PROBABLY REACTING DIRECTOR DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES AND I THINK I'M JUST GOING TO PASS IT QUICKLY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. SITTING TAMAKO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE AGENDA DOES A NICE JOB OF OUTLINING THE I IT JUST SAYS MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE PROPOSAL. THAN HAPPY TO PROVIDE A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW AS IT PERTAINS TO AYE HSS. AS A RESULT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES SB NINETY NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT REPORT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO REPLACE THE STATE WHY COUNTY I HSS MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT AND TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY FROM TWO BILLION TO APPROXIMATELY. ONE POINT FIVE SIX BILLION A REDUCTION OF FOUR HUNDRED FORTY ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION. THE REVISED MOE REFLECTS THE PROJECTED LEVEL OF COUNTIES I IT JUST ASK COSTS THAT CAN BE FUNDED WITH THE NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT AND THE BUDGET YEAR. THE BUDGET ALSO PROPOSES TO REDUCE THE ANNUAL AND THOUGH WE INFLATION FACTOR FROM 7% 24% BEGAN. TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND ELIMINATE THAT ARE OFTEN MEDICATION. THANK YOU AND HAVE BEEN ANSWERING QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. AS THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE OUTLINED THEIR SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO I'D JUST SAYS -- THESE ARE THE MORE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES BEING PROPOSED IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT BROADLY -- OUR OFFICE IN OCTOBER WE DID A REPORT IN WHICH WE LOOKED AT NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENTS TO ASSESS WHETHER IT'S MEETING CERTAIN CORE PRINCIPLES FOR ANY REALIGNMENT AND WE REACH SUMMER CONCLUSIONS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DID IN THEIR JANUARY REPORT THAT THERE IS A MISALIGNMENT TODAY. MAINLY WORK AND REGARDING REVENUE WHEN IT COMES TO I JUST US BUT ALSO COUNTY COST AND I JUST AS REFLECTING THEIR ABILITY TO CONTROL THOSE COSTS -- SO WE SEE THAT THE PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE IHS US COUNTY COSTS IS A MOVE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO MEETING THESE CORE PRINCIPLES. BUT TWO THINGS WE DID FLAG IN OUR REPORT -- ONE THAT. THE LEGISLATURE WE RECOMMEND THAT THROUGH THE ANNUAL BUDGET YEAR PROCESS JUST MONITORING REVENUES TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE COVERING COST OVER TIME BUT ALSO. BY REDUCING I JUST AS COUNTY COST THAT THEN SHIFTS I HIGHER SHARE OF COSTS TO THE STATE WHILE THIS IS APPROPRIATE THIS DOES BRING UP QUESTIONS FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION AROUND. HOW ARE WE PLANNING FOR THE AGING POPULATION POTENTIAL COST PRESSURES ON RIGHTEOUS AS BUT ALSO MORE BROADLY -- AGAIN THE AGING POPULATION IN THE STATE BUDGET [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR GOMEZ REYES AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BELLA RAMOS AND IT IS A PLEASURE TO BE HERE SPEAKING ON BEHALF. OF ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES OF THE GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE THANKFUL FOR THE GOVERNOR'S INCREASE IN THE STATE GENERAL FUND COMMITMENT TO AYE HSS. WE WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS OUR GRATITUDE TO THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE FOR ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE. TO BRING UP CLOSE TO THIS GAP THAT IS LOOMING OVER EVERY SINGLE COUNTY AND OUR STATE. WE'RE PROUD TO PARTNER WITH THE STATE TO ADMINISTER THIS FEDERAL ENTITLEMENT WHICH HAS NO CAP WHICH AS YOU HEARD EARLIER FROM PUBLIC TESTIMONY WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO BE ABLE TO SERVE THESE HALF MILLION SENIORS AND DISABLED INDIVIDUALS. SO THAT THEY MAY AGE WITH DIGNITY IN PLACE AT HOME. CURRENTLY COSTS ARE HIGHER THAN THE REVENUES ANTICIPATED FROM REALIGNMENT REVENUES. WE ARE HAVING TO RE DIRECT FUNDS FROM VERY VITAL PUBLIC AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AT OUR COUNTIES TO BE ABLE TO SHOULDER THE COST FOR THOSE COUNTY. THE COUNTY ADDITIONAL AYE HSS COST SHARE THIS IS SIMPLY NOT SUSTAINABLE FOR YOUR FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES NOR IS IT SUSTAINABLE FOR THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE SERVE. UNDER THIS VERY VITAL PROGRAM PUZZLE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES THIS COMMITMENT FROM THE GENERAL FUND BEGINNING IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND TO AND INTO TWO THOUSAND TWENTY AND WHAT IT REALLY DOES IS IT PROVIDES IS THAT FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY TO BE ABLE. TO NEGOTIATE THESE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS TO BE ABLE TOMOVE FORWARD AND WHILE THERE ISN'T A COP IT CERTAINLY PROVIDES AS THE FISCAL CERTAINTY THAT WE NEED TO ALL OF US TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD WHETHER IT'S ON THE COUNTY SIDE OR ON THE BARGAINING SIDE. BY LOWERING THE MOE BASED AND REDUCING THE ANNUAL INFLATION FACTOR FROM 724% WE SEE A RECOGNITION OF THE TWO GREATEST FACTORS THAT ARE DRIVING THE SITE JUST ASK COSTS ONE IS THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE. AND THE OTHER IS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF FEDERAL OVERTIME RULES. BOTH OF THESE ARE OUTSIDE OF THE CONTROL OF EACH OF YOUR FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. THESE REALIGNMENT REVENUES SIMPLY ARE NOT ENOUGH WITHOUT THIS PROPOSAL IN PLACE. REDUCING THE INFLATION FACTOR PROVIDE THE STRUCTURAL SUSTAINABILITY IS FOR COUNTIES TO MOVE FORWARD. THAT ALIGNS ITSELF WITH HISTORICAL REALIGNMENT REVENUE GROWTH AND IS IN THE BALLPARK OF THE ANNUAL PROGRAM CASE LOAD GROWTH. THIS ENSURES THAT WE CAN PLACE VITAL DOLLARS FOR PUBLIC AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES RESTORING THOSE SERVICES TO ALL OF OUR RESIDENTS. THIS PROPOSAL WHILE IT DOES NOT ELIMINATE THE RISK OF REALIGNMENT AND IT DOES NOT PROVIDE A CAP IT CERTAINLY DOES PROVIDE AN IMPROVED OUTLOOK FOR THOSE CRITICAL SOCIAL SERVICES HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS FOR THE RESIDENTS WE SERVE AND HSS SUPPORT SERVICE PROGRAMS TO ALLOW THEM. TO AGE WITH DIGNITY AND PLACE ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA'S FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO PARTNER WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND WITH THE LEGISLATURE. TO PROVIDE WHAT NECESSARY TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IS NECESSARY AND TO ENSURE THE AYE HSS A SUSTAINABLE INTO THE FUTURE THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AGAIN MY NAME IS CHRISTINA BOSS HAMILTON I'M HERE. REPRESENTING YOU W. ASKED ME. WE REPRESENT A HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND I JUST US WORKERS IN TWENTY ONE COUNTIES. I THINK ALL OF US IN THIS ROOM COULD AGREE THAT I HSS IS A LIFESAVING CRITICAL PROGRAM FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE'RE HERE OUT OF DESPERATION BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVE IN AYE HSS IS THE WORK FORCE. PROBLEM WE CANNOT HIRE ANOTHER FOR WORKERS TO DO THIS JOB BECAUSE IT PAYS VERY VERY LITTLE. SPECIFICALLY WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING IS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. TO ADD ADDITIONAL GENERAL FUND SUPPORT TO OFFSET COUNTY COSTS THAT IT BE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE ABILITY OF A COUNTY TO REACH A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT WITH ITS WORKERS. WE HAVE BEEN TO THIS BUDGET CAN TIMES IN THE LAST FIVE TO TEN YEARS TO DISCUSS THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE HAD WITH LOCAL COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND OUR INABILITY TO GET RESOLUTION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY FORCES US TO COME TO THE STATE. TO SEEK INTERVENTION THIS IS A PUBLIC POLICY ISSUE THAT THE STATE MUST INTERVENE ON BECAUSE WE SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD TO KEEP PAYING THESE WORKERS. MINIMUM WAGE WHEN THEY CAN GO AND WORK IN FAST FOOD AND GET PAID MORE AND GET HEALTH BENEFITS. I PASSED -- I ASKED THE SERGEANT TO PASS OUT A CHART. YOU YOU SHOULD HOPEFULLY HAVE IT IN FRONT OF YOU IT LISTS ARE TWENTY ONE COUNTIES. JUST TO GIVE YOU A REALLY QUICK SNAPSHOT THE COUNTIES THAT ARE IN YELLOW ARE ALL OPEN CONTRACTS. THAT MEANS OUT OF THE TWENTY ONE COUNTIES ONLY SEVEN HAVE AGREEMENTS IN PLACE RIGHT NOW. IF YOU LOOK AT THE COLUMN THAT SAYS TIME SINCE EXPIRATION THAT IS THE AMOUNT OF TIME SINCE THE LAST CONTRACT EXPIRES THE AVERAGE TIME IS THIRTY FIVE MONTHS. THAT MEANS THE AVERAGE CONTRACT HAS BEEN OPEN FOR ALMOST THREE YEARS. IF YOU LOOK AT THE GREEN. THE GREEN ARE THE ONLY COUNTIES THAT EVEN PAY ABOVE THE MINIMUM WAGE AND RIGHT NOW. YOU CAN SEE THERE'S ONLY SEVEN THAT PAY ABOVE THE MINIMUM WAGE. THAT IS A DISGRACE. SO WE ARE ASKING THE STATE IS THAT BEFORE THE SAVINGS THAT YOU ARE PROPOSING WHICH ARE IN GENERAL A REALLY GOOD THING. THAT IT BE LINKED TO THE ABILITY OF A COUNTY TO BARGAIN CONTRACTS WE HAVE BEEN TO THIS BODY BEFORE. AND TO GIVE YOU REALLY QUICK TIMELINE GOING BACK TO TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WE PETITIONED THE STATE TO APPLY FOR COMMUNITY FIRST CHOICE OPTION EXTRA FEDERAL FUNDING WHICH INCREASE THE FEDERAL OF PORTION THAT PAY TOWARD I JUST SAYS. THAT RESULTED IN A REFUND TO ALL THE COUNTIES FOR THE AMOUNT THAT THEY HAD EXPENDED ON THE PROGRAM WE HAD DONE THAT IN ORDER. TO REDUCE COSTS AND HAVE THAT MONEY BE PUT BACK INTO I JUST AS WAGES AND THAT IDN'T HAPPEN. I WANT TO SHOW YOU THAT THE COLUMN AS LAST NEGOTIATED WAGE INCREASE YOU CAN SEE THAT THAT'S THE THOSE ARE THE DATES OF THE LAST TIME THAT. COUNTIES AGREED TO INCREASE WAGES AS YOU CAN SEE THE AVERAGE THERE'S ABOUT FOUR YEARS THAT MEANS THAT THESE WAGES ARE ONLY INCREASING BECAUSE THE MINIMUM WAGE IS INCREASING. AND UNLESS WERE ABLE TO RESOLVE THIS LOCALLY IT WILL BRING US BACK TO THE STATE AGAIN AND AGAIN. FOR RESOLUTION. IT IN THE WHEN YOU OF AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS PASSED AND MEDICAID EXPANSION HAPPENED. THE ONLY WAY WE WERE ABLE TO GET WAGE INCREASES AT THAT TIME WAS BECAUSE WE AGREE TO SHIP THE DOLLARS AND CENTS THAT WERE BEING PUT INTO HEALTH BENEFITS. TO ADD THAT TO WAGES BECAUSE ALL THOSE WORKERS QUALIFY FOR MEDI CAL. AND SO THERE WAS NO NET COST TO THAT BUT IT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO SEE ANY DOLLAR AND SENT INCREASE FOR THESE WORKERS. IN TWENTY TWELVE WHEN THE MO YOU WAS PASSED THAT ESSENTIALLY RENDERED COUNTIES OF A NEUTRAL FOR ANY OTHER COSTS IN THE PROGRAM ASIDE FOR THE GROWTH FACTOR. IN FOR WHATEVER THEY BARGAINED IN CONTRACTS THAT RESULTED IN NOTHING THAT RESULTED IN NO NAY INCREASES EXCEPT FOR A FEW OF THE GOOD COUNTIES THAT HAVE BEEN DOING THEIR DUE DILIGENCE. AND THEN FINALLY IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE HELP TO PASS AS BEING NINETY WHICH INCLUDED OTHER INCENTIVES FOR BARGAINING SUCH AS MANDATORY MEDIATION. BECAUSE THAT WAS NOT BINDING. THERE WAS NO WAY FOR US TO GET THE COUNTY TO ADOPT WHATEVER IT WAS THAT A MEDIATOR WOULD AGREE TO OR WOULD RECOMMEND AS AS BEING A NEUTRAL. OF RESOLUTION. AND FINALLY WE ASK FOR XCELERATED A CASE LOAD GROWTH FUNDS TO BE SO THAT WHATEVER THAT MONIES THAT WERE OUTWEIGHED BY THE COUNTY WILL GET REFUNDED BACK TO THEM AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE. THE REALIGNMENT DOLLARS AND NOT DIDN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE EITHER. SO WE'RE NOT HERE SAYING THAT. ALL COUNTIES ARE ARE BAD ACTORS WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME THAT DO THE RIGHT BY THE PROGRAM AND BELIEVE THAT IT IS A GOOD PROGRAM TO INVEST IN. BUT IN OTHER COUNTIES WE SIMPLY AREN'T SEEING THAT HAPPEN AND SO WE'RE COMING TO YOU OUT OF DESPERATION AND ASKING FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE THANK YOU THANK YOU. TIFFANY WHITEN WITH AT THE ARE YOU CALIFORNIA I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND I'D JUST AS PROVIDERS IN THIRTY SEVEN COUNTIES I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE BY MY COLLEAGUE -- AT UT W.. THERE'S TWENTY THREE OF OUR THIRTY SEVEN COUNTIES THAT DO NOT HAVE A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT. SAMBAR NAY DINO HAS NOT HAD A BARGAINING AGREEMENT SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN FRESNO SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN HUMBOLDT SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN LASSEN COUNTY HAS NEVER HAD A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT -- CRISTINA MENTIONED MANDATORY MEDIATION LASSEN WENT TO MANDATORY MEDIATION THE FINDINGS WERE IN FAVOR OF THE UNION. LASSEN JUST DOES NOT DO ANYTHING THEY HAVE NOT INCORPORATED ANYTHING THEY HAVE NOT MOVE FORWARD ON ANYTHING AND TO THIS DAY WE HAVE NEVER HAD A CONTRACT IN LASSEN COUNTY. THAT'S THAT'S NOT OKAY -- THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN IN ANY LINE OF WORK IF YOU WERE STATE EMPLOYEES THERE WOULD BE OUTRAGE IF. A HOSPITAL DID NOT HAVE A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT THERE WOULD BE OUTRAGE IF I JUST AS PROVIDERS DO NOT HAVE A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT NOBODY BATS AN EYE. THAT'S NOT OKAY THERE'S NO RECOURSE THERE'S NO BINDING ARBITRATION SIMILAR TO A PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICIALS ARE PROVIDERS CAN'T STRIKE NOR WHAT THEY WANT TO STRIKE BECAUSE THEY LOVE THE WORK THAT THEY DO. SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE AND THERE NEEDS TO BE ACCOUNTABILITY. NOT HAVING A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT IS A DISMISSAL OF I IT JUST AS PROVIDERS IT IS THE DISMISSAL OF THE CLIENTS THAT THEY SERVE AND IT'S A DISMISSAL OF THE PROGRAM AS A WHOLE.

GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MIGHT THE GUERRERO REPRESENTED LOS ANGELES COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE ADMINISTRATION THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ON THE AYE HSS MOE. DEFINITELY SUPPORTED AS WELL THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. I WANT TO BRING IT BACK TO THE PANELISTS -- AND VERY SPECIFICALLY I'D LIKE TO ASK -- THE ADMINISTRATION'S TO SACK. TO PLEASE RESPOND TO THE ADVOCATES PROPOSALS HERE -- WHAT ARE THE CONSIDERATIONS WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF COUNTY IN PROGRAM IMPACT? THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- WE CERTAINLY DO -- YOU KNOW I THINK WE'RE ALL IN AGREEMENT ON THE NEED FOR THIS FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY OF THE PROGRAM AND FOR THE MOE INFLATOR TO BE AT 4% -- WHEN IT COMES TO THE TREE BRINGING THE 7% INFLATOR DOWN SINCE JULY TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WHEN THE NEW MARKETING TOOLS WERE PUT IN PLACE FOR COUNTIES? AND FOR YOU D. W. AND SEIU TO WORK TOGETHER EIGHTEEN BARGAINING AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN REACHED THAT IS THE HIGHEST AMOUNT OF BARGAINING AGREEMENTS THAT WE HAVE HAD REACHED DURING THAT TIME. AND I WILL SAY THAT THAT DID OCCUR DURING THE TIME THAT THESE COUNTIES WERE FACING AS ALL OF US WERE THESE REALIGNMENTS SHORTFALLS. IT IS THIS REDUCED INFLATION FACTOR THAT IS GOING TO BE THE RECOGNITION FOR THE COUNTIES THAT THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF FEDERAL OVERTIME LAWS. CAN PROVIDE ASSISTANCE FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY MOVING FORWARD WHAT ELSE SAY FROM MYSELF FROM THE COUNTY OF NAPA WE ARE AN S. C. I. U. BARGAINING COUNTY. AND THAT WE HAVE REACHED OUT TO OUR AYE HSS BARGAINING UNIT A NUMBER OF TIMES -- AND IT HAS NOT BEEN FOR LACK OF THE COUNTY TRYING TO TO REACH A NEW AGREEMENT TO DISCUSS THAT -- FOR WHATEVER REASON AND THEY THEY HAVEN'T ENGAGED WITH US WE WILL READ BE REACHING OUT AGAIN -- AS WE DO KNOW THAT IT'S IT'S DEFINITELY TIME AM I THINK THAT THESE. THE BOOK GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL PROVIDES ALL OF US THE FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY TO MOVE THIS PROGRAM FORWARD AND CERTAINLY THE ABILITY TO DO SO. IN A WAY THAT PROVIDES DIGNITY NOT JUST TO THE AYE HSS. SERVICE RECIPIENTS BUT TO THE WORKERS THEMSELVES SOMETHING THAT WE DO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THAT THEY DESERVE THEY DO NEED TO HAVE THESE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. AGREEMENTS IN PLACE AND REDUCE LONG WAY TO PROVIDING THAT FISCAL CERTAINTY TO GET US TO THAT PLACE. ANY COMMENTS FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. ACTUALLY -- A MORE SPECIFIC QUESTION CAN THE ADMINISTRATION RESPOND TO THE ISSUES TECHNICAL COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. AND ANY WAY THAT THE STATE POLICY CAN BE REVISED TO RESPOND TO THIS -- STAGNANT SEE. IN THE ROOM NOT INSURE PITCHER RECORD WITH THE DEPARTMENT -- I I THINK THERE ARE A COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS TO ANSWER THE QUESTION I MEAN THE FIRST -- AS YOU'VE HEARD ALREADY COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IN THE I JUST SAYS PROGRAM IS AN ISSUE BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES AND THE REPRESENTATIVE UNION FOR THAT THOSE COUNTIES -- SO I'M NOT GOING TO OFFER SPECIFICS OR IN ANYWAY INTRUDE ON THAT RELATIONSHIP WHAT WHAT I WILL SAY -- IS THAT THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU -- IS IS ONE POTENTIAL METHOD OF INCENTIVIZING ACHIEVING AN AGREEMENT -- THERE ARE PROBABLY OTHER WAYS TO DO SO AS WELL -- I THINK FROM THE STATE PERSPECTIVE -- WHAT WE WOULD SAY IS THAT? OUR GOAL AND THE REASON THAT THOSE OF US WHO WORK IN THIS PROGRAM WORK IN A PROGRAM IS THAT PROTECTING AND SERVING THE I. H. ASSESS CLIENTS. PART OF THE JOB OF DOING THAT DEPENDS ON A STABLE WORK FORCE. OF PROVIDERS WILLING AND ABLE AND FAIRLY COMPENSATED TO DO THAT WORK -- AND CLEARLY ACHIEVING OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT -- IT IS PART OF PROVIDING THE STABLE COMPENSATION. THAT ENABLES THAT TO HAPPEN SO WE'RE SUPPORTIVE OF OF PEOPLE A REACHING THOSE AGREEMENTS OF THE LOCAL LEVEL -- BUT I'M NOT GOING TO PRESENT YOU WITH POTENTIAL FISCAL OPTIONS AND WAYS TO INCENTIVIZE THAT. ALTHOUGH WE'RE HAPPY TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WHEN IT COMES TO STATE FUNDING DECISIONS. WELL WHAT ABOUT TWO WHERE THE PARTY STARTS ON STATEWIDE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AS AN ALTERNATIVE. UNDER THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION AS PART OF THE COORDINATED KAREN ISSUED IF THERE WAS A STATEWIDE AUTHORITY CREATED TO DO THAT BARGAINING FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS I KNOW THEIR ACTUAL AGREEMENTS WERE ENTERED INTO -- UNDER THE STATE WIDE AUTHORITY AND THAT STATEWIDE AUTHORITY WAS THAT AND I WAS SUNSET AND ELIMINATED -- WITH THE SECESSION. THE THIS MEDICARE INITIATIVE -- BYE BYE BYE STATUTES SO I I WOULD TELL YOU THAT IT'S BEEN TRIED -- AND AND WASN'T SUCCESSFUL IN THAT CURRENT LAW CURRENTLY REQUIRES THAT TO BE A LOCAL COUNTY DECISION. IF THAT WERE TO BE RE IMPLEMENTED LEGISLATIVELY. WHAT WOULD THE ADMINISTRATION DO DIFFERENTLY? TO ENSURE THAT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS COULD BE REACHED. OF FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE WORKERS AND IN THE END THEY ALLOW THE THE COUNTIES TO THEN -- TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE 4%. AT THE TIME WE HAD A STATE WIDE AUTHORITY THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE BARGAINING LIED WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN OR CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES CALLIE CHAR -- I'M NOT FEELING THAT I'M PARTICULARLY IN A POSITION TO GIVE YOU ADVICE ON WHAT THIS ADMINISTRATION WOULD DO OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO BE LEGISLATED. IF THERE'S CONSIDERATION OF THAT OBVIOUSLY THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD WANT TO BE INVOLVED EARLY IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS. THANK YOU. WOULD ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO RESPOND. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- THE PILOT TO DO STATEWIDE BARGAINING WAS I WOULD SAY ENTERED INTO SOMEWHAT RELUCTANTLY BY THE PRIOR GOVERNOR AND IT WAS ONLY IN SEVEN COUNTIES. IT WAS A LINK THROUGH TO THE pWHICH HAD A FAIRLY ROCKY START. AND FRANKLY TOOK AWHILE TO GET GOING AND I I THINK WASN'T QUITE AS SUCCESSFUL AS THE ADMINISTRATION HAD HOPED IT TO BE. SO I THINK THAT THERE'S TWO THINGS THAT WERE PREDOMINANT FOR WHY IT WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL OVERALL. NUMBER ONE THE COURT NEED TO KAREN IS I'M BECAME CLEAR WAS NOT GOING TO YIELD THE STATE SAVINGS THAT THEY THOUGHT THAT IT WAS GOING. TO AND I BELIEVE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION ONLY AGREED TO DO STATEWIDE BARGAINING WITH THE BELIEF THAT WHATEVER SAVINGS CAME OUT OF THE CC I WOULD ACTUALLY BE WHAT THEY USED TO FUND ANY SORT OF WAGE AND BENEFIT INCREASE. AND THEN SECOND TO THAT -- I WOULD SAY IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE JUST GENERAL INSTABILITY AND THE FACT THAT THE PER THE LAW THAT. CREATED THE STATE WIDE BARGAINING WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO BARGAIN OVER WAS ACTUALLY EXTRAORDINARILY NARROW AND SO THERE WAS JUST PROBLEMS WITH YOU KNOW WHAT IT WAS THAT WE COULD EVEN DISCUSS AT THE TABLE SO. FRANKLY I WOULDN'T USE THAT AS AN EXAMPLE WHY IT WOULDN'T BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE FUTURE I THINK WITH THE NEW ADMINISTRATION AND A NEW POLITICAL WILL. IT WOULD BE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT SCENARIO AND WE WOULD SUPPORT THAT A 100% WE JUST HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE REALITY THAT THAT'S NOT HAPPENING ANYTIME SOON. AND SADLY UNTIL IT HAPPENS WERE WERE OUT WHERE WE'RE AT AND AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY THANK YOU. SO ARE MY NOTES CORRECT THAT W. AND FOURTEEN OF THIRTY SEVEN S. CI YOU -- COUNTIES DO HAVE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING THE REST DO NOT. AND I DID GET THE THE PRINT OUT FOR YOU D. W. I DIDN'T HAVE ONE FIRST YEAH YOU. IF THERE IS ONE IT SHOULD BE ALL FIFTY EIGHT ON ONE DO YOU HAVE THAT ON THE SECOND PAGE IS JUST A SMALL COPY OF THE BIG. THE FRONT PAGE WE WILL GET IT TO YOU THANK YOU. LET ME BRING IT TO THE THE MEMBERS. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MISTER RAMOS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND LOOKING AT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. HERE TODAY AS FAR AS THE BUDGET PROPOSAL FROM THE GOVERNOR. IS MONEY FROM THAT PROPOSAL -- COULD BE USED FOR WAGING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. PETE FROM THAT APARTMENT AND I'M GOING -- TO TRY TO REITERATE WHAT MY COLLEAGUE -- CINDY TANIMOTO FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TRIED IT EXPLAINED AS SHE LAID OUT THE AYE HSS I'M A WE PROPOSAL. HE IS SENSUALLY AYE IT JUST SAYS ADMIN HAS BEEN CARVED OUT AS A BUDGET ALLOCATION NO LONGER SUBJECT TO AND I'M A WE REQUIREMENTS. AND THE STATE HAS. BUT WHAT WHAT WE SAY WE'VE ELIMINATED STATE MITIGATION FUNDING FOR THE IMPACT OF A HIGHER AND WE ON COUNTIES WE'VE DROPPED THE AMMO WE REQUIREMENT ON COUNTIES -- AND YOU'VE HEARD THEIR SUPPORT FOR THAT BECAUSE THAT BETTER ALIGNS THAT AM A WE WITH AVAILABLE REALIGNMENT -- REVENUES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THE LOCAL COUNTY BUT WHAT THAT MEANS IS WHEN THERE'S NO CUT TO THE PROGRAM TO FILL THE TOTAL BUDGET. THERE'S NO SAVINGS FROM OUR PROPOSAL IN FACT THE STATE IS PICKING UP SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN COSTS THAT OTHERWISE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN. A BURDEN ON COUNTIES IN EXCESS OF THEIR AVAILABLE REVENUES SO THERE'S NO SAVINGS BEING CREATED TO AT THE STATE LEVEL FOR THIS IN FACT. IT'S AN ONGOING GENERAL FUND COMMITMENT TO FULLY MEET THE COST OF THE I JUST SAYS PROGRAM -- SO I HOPE THAT'S HELPFUL IN EXPLAINING THERE ARE NO AVINGS IN THE PROPOSAL THAT COULD BE USED FOR OTHER PURPOSES. SO THE PROPOSAL IS JUST BASICALLY -- TRYING TO CREATE A THE BREAK EVEN AS FAR AS THE COSTS THAT ARE OUT THERE NOW. SO LOOKING AT SOME OF THE AREAS SHE KNOWS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WE WENT THROUGH A PERIOD OF WHERE -- WE THOUGHT THAT -- THE STATE WAS GOING TO BE NEGOTIATED SOME OF THESE THINGS AND IT DIDN'T HAPPEN NOW IS BACK AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. BUT YOU ALSO SEE WHERE THERE'S BEEN SOME -- DIFFERENT -- FRACTIONS AS FAR AS TRYING TO GET CONTRACTS APPROVED AND STILL NEGOTIATIONS GOING ON AND YOU SEE -- MINIMUM WAGE YOU SEE SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE THERE. AND BRINGING UP SAN MARINO COUNTY THAT'S BEEN TRYING TO GET -- CLOSURE ON ON AGREEMENT FOR MANY YEARS AND I THINK IT'S OR FIVE YEARS. THAT HAS BEEN THERE AND THE TALK. AS FAR AS BEING TO BEING ABLE TO INCREASE THOSE WAGES. WOULD THAT FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO COME FROM THE STATE WE'RE HEARING DIFFERENT SPEAKERS COME OUT AND TALK ABOUT TIENE SOME OF THIS -- NEGOTIATIONS TO TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SO IF YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S NO -- WHERE TO ACTUALLY HAVE AN AN INCREASE COMING FROM THE MONEY THAT'S BEING PROPOSED NOW HOW DO WE GET TO THE POINT TO WHERE WE CAN START TO DISCUSS? THE WAGE INCREASES AND FROM THE STATE COMING DOWN TO THE COUNTY TO HELP WITH THOSE WAGE INCREASES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. I'M IN A DEFERRED TO SOME OF THE OTHER PANEL MEMBERS STATE TO ADD TO IT TO THAT CONVERSATION AGAIN THE BARGAINING RELATIONSHIP AS I COUNTY UNION AND NOT COUNTY ISSUE DOT FOR THE STATE TO ADDRESS I I I GET THAT OUT. WHAT WE BUT THERE'S FUNDING AND FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AT THE STATE COULD ALSO OFFER TO THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT WOULD? HELP IN SOME OF THOSE NEGOTIATIONS THAT ARE CONDUCTED PURELY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THERE ARE A VARIETY OF THINGS LIKE THIS THE STATE COULD POTENTIALLY OFFER -- OBVIOUSLY USUALLY THE NEGOTIATION OVER OVER WAGES AND AND BENEFITS IS IS A FISCAL ONE LISTEN TO STAKE ASSEMBLY ALLOCATE GENERAL FUND FOR THAT PURPOSE. IT COULD. DO WHAT THIS PROPOSAL FOR YOU FROM UT W. AND I SEE I YOU DOES -- WHICH IS KEEP THE COUNTY MO WE HIRE UNLESS THERE'S A A BARGAINING AGREEMENT IN PLACE IN WHICH CASE THE COUNTY YOU WOULD THEN HAVE A LOWER AND WE AND MONEY TO PAY FOR IT. THAT THAT'S ONE POTENTIAL STRUCTURES WELL I'M RELUCTANT TO ADVOCATE ANY PARTICULAR SOLUTION HERE BUT THAT'S ROUGHLY HOW THE MECHANICS HERE IN IDEAS PRETTY MUCH. GETTING A DEPARTMENT FINDS MISTER TRINKETS RIGHT TO EXTEND THE IT'S APPROPRIATE THE STATE WHAT THEY WANT TO USE GENERAL FUND. FOR JUST PROVIDING -- WAGE INCREASE -- TO TO BE DONE TO BUT WE'RE DOING IT ON ON ON SIR MACINNES REWORKED. PAYING FOR MINIMUM WAGE ALREADY FOR THOSE FOR COUNTIES OR ARE AT THE MINIMUM WAGE AT THE MOMENT -- ME BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S LIKE THIS PRIORITY RIGHT RESOURCES ARE FRIDAY REDUCING. THE MAYBE GOVERNOR HAS ARE VERY -- ROBUST BUDGET INCLUDING A LOT OF RESOURCES FOR NEW PRIVATE PROGRAMS AND IT'S APPROPRIATE AND IN THE DAY SO IT'S IT'S IT'S JUST. NOW THAT THE BACK IS THAT THE BEST WAY TO GO ABOUT WITH THIS. IF I MAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT WHATEVER THE BAR -- THE COUNTY CHOOSES TO BARGAIN IN TERMS OF IN A WAGER BENEFIT AGREEMENT. THE WAY THAT I JUST AS FUNDING WORKS IS WHATEVER THE EXPENDITURE IS SO WHATEVER THE COST OF THAT WE DO BENEFITING CREASE IS. IT'S ACTUALLY MATCHED OVERWHELMINGLY BY STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDING SO THE ACTUAL DOLLAR INCREASE THE AMOUNT COMING OUT OF THE COUNTIES SHARE IS ONLY SIXTEEN CENTS. AND THAT'S SIXTEEN CENTS COMES BACK TO THEM IN THE FORM OF NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT SO THAT MAYBE [inaudible] POINT. YOU KNOW FIVE CENT ACTUALLY COMES OUT OF THEIR GENERAL FUND. SO THERE IS. ACTUALLY NO REAL REASON WHY THESE WAGES AND BENEFITS WHAT WHAT HAPPENS IS WE GET PITTED. POOR PEOPLE AGAINST POOR PEOPLE BECAUSE THEN WHAT THEY'LL SAY AS WELL IF WE PAY YOU. THEN WE WON'T HAVE ENOUGH REALIGNMENT DOLLARS FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND WE WON'T HAVE ENOUGH FOR CHILD WELFARE AND WE WON'T HOUND HAVE ENOUGH FOR EVERY OTHER BUCKET. THAT FALLS UNDER AYE HSS BECAUSE LOOK THEN EVERYONE ELSE IS GOING TO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH WITH SERVICES THEY'RE NOT RECEIVING. AND WE REFUSE TO ACCEPT THAT WE'RE PITTING POOR PEOPLE AGAINST EACH OTHER FOR PENNIES PENNIES ON THE DOLLAR THERE'S NO REAL REASON EXCEPT THAT IT'S A PHILOSOPHICAL DISAGREEMENT. WITH WHAT IT IS THAT THESE WORKERS DO. AND UNFORTUNATELY SO LONG AS THESE ARE DECISIONS MADE BY SUPERVISORS WHO FOR THE MOST PART DON'T BELIEVE THAT. FAMILY MEMBER SHOULD GET PAID FOR TAKING CARE OF FAMILY MEMBERS BECAUSE LET'S BE REAL THAT'S WHAT REALLY WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. SO LONG AS THAT'S WHO WERE MAKING THESE AGREEMENTS WITH. THIS IS WHERE WE'RE AT BECAUSE IF I WAS A COUNTY SUPERVISOR I WOULD JUMP AT THE CHANCE THAT POINT FIVE CENT OF MY INVESTMENT IS GOING TO YIELD A DOLLAR IN RETURN. THAT THEN WILL BE SPENT IN MY LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND IN MY LOCAL ECONOMY BECAUSE POOR PEOPLE DON'T PUT IT INTO THEIR FOUR ONE CASE AND THEY DON'T GO BUY STOCK OPTIONS. THEY GO TO THE CORNER STORE BUY MILK. AND SO THERE'S NO REASON WHY THIS IS NOT AN ECONOMICALLY WISE DECISION TO MAKE. WE WE WE ARE HERE FOR SOLUTIONS BECAUSE WE SIMPLY AREN'T ABLE TO CHEAT THEM LOCALLY. THANK YOU AND AND ECOGNIZING -- THE CHALLENGES OF THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AREAS DOWN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- BUT KNOWING -- FROM MY EXPERIENCE ALSO THE HARD WORK THAT -- MEMBERS DO IS PARTICULARLY SEIU IS SEVENTY OF COUNTY IN THE WORK THAT THEY DO IN CARING FOR THOSE THAT ARE OUT THERE AND MANY TIMES THEY ARE FAMILY MEMBERS MANY TIMES THERE'S NOT BUT THAT SHOULDN'T BE THE DISCUSSION. THE DISCUSSION IS YOUR CARING FOR ECONOMIC VALUE IN OUR AREAS AND FIRST THAT OUR COMMUNITIES ARE STRONGER WHEN HOME CARE WORKERS CONTINUE. TO WORK BUT THEY NEED TO GET THAT LIVING WAGE AS FAR AS MOVING FORWARD IN TRYING TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND TRY TO TAKE CARE OF MANY OF THOSE IN OUR COMMUNITY WHICH YOU ONLY SEE THE POPULATION GROWING -- IN THE POPULATION IS GOING TO NEED THE SERVICES DOWN THE ROAD. SO I THINK A LOT OF THE TOPICS A LOT OF THE PUBLIC SPEAKERS IT CAME UP AS FAR AS TRYING TO REACH AN AGREEMENT AND PUTTING THAT INTO ONE OF THE PARAMETERS OF APPROVING -- A PROPOSAL ORA BILL GOING FORWARD IS SOMETHING THAT I'M VERY INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT WHEN THIS COMES BACK TO THIS TO THIS BODY. BUT ALSO -- REACH AN AGREEMENT IN ENSURING PROPER WAGE FOR COUNTY WORKERS BUT ALSO FOR COUNTIES THAT CONTINUE TO NOT COME TO AN AGREEMENT I THINK THIS IS A A FAIR. ASSUMPTION NOW THAT THIS HAS CAUGHT THE ATTENTION OF THOSE IN THE COLLEAGUES HERE THAT MAYBE. SOME OF THAT WORK NEEDS TO HAPPEN PRETTY QUICKLY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU MISTER AHMOSE. ALL RIGHT SAYING NOTHING FURTHER I DO WANT TO THANK YOU THIS ITEM WILL BE HELD OPEN AND IT'S CLEAR THAT THERE ARE ISSUES THAT THE THE MEMBERS -- THE ADVOCATES IN THE ADMINISTRATION I THINK THEY'RE ISSUES THAT ARE OPEN BUT I THINK THAT WE ALL NEED TO TAKE -- CLOSER LOOK AT TO TRY TO FIND SOLUTIONS BECAUSE THIS IS NOT SUSTAINABLE WE'VE GOT TO FIND A BETTER WAY TO DO THIS. AND DO WHETHER IT'S JUST THE CARROT WITH THE CARROT AND THE STICK IF THE CARE IT'S NOT WORKING LET'S FIGURE OUT WHAT THE STICK IS AND FIGURE OUT HOW IN THE END. WE DO EXACTLY AS MISTER RAMOS SAID WE JUST PROVIDE AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING PROTECTION FOR THOSE WERE PROVIDING THE SERVICE. I THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY THANK YOU. AND NOW I EIGHT THE NEXT ISSUE WE'RE GOING WE'RE GOING TO SKIP OVER. THREE FOUR AND FIVE AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE ISSUE. SIX WE HAVE SOME SO SITE ADVOCATES. THAT HAVE TO CATCH A BUS.

MADAM CHAIR -- MY CAROL WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY -- THANK YOU FOR MOVING THIS SO WE CAN GET HERE FROM THE THE CLIENTS THEMSELVES AND I'M JUST GOING VERY VERY SHORT WHICH IS -- WE ARE LOOKING IN THIS BUDGET TO TRY TO IN STAGES RESTORE THE SSI GRANT THAT WAS REDUCED -- BACK DURING THE GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER TIME IN STAGES BACK 21100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL -- WE'VE HAD A PROPOSAL UNDER IN PRIOR YEARS TO DO THAT OVER TWO OR THREE STAGES -- WE ARE STILL IN INTERESTED IN SOME APPROACH LIKE THAT -- WE THINK THAT IF WE COULD MAKE A GOOD FOR STEP ON THAT THIS YEAR -- AND I'M JUST KNOW THAT EVEN THOUGH WE DID CASH OUT LAST YEAR IN A LOT OF PEOPLE GOING TO BENEFIT WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT THAT A LOT LATER ON IN THE AGENDA. SOME YOU HAVE ONE POINT TWO MILLION PEOPLE IN THE PROGRAM. IF WE DO A GREAT JOB WE GET A HALF A MILLION PEOPLE SNAP BENEFITS THAT'S GREAT THEY'RE GOING TO GET A BOOST. BUT THAT ALSO MEANS WE HAVE SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND RECIPIENTS WHO WON'T GET AN INCREASE AND THAT'S WHERE I THINK WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ON THE GRANTS BECAUSE WE HAVE MANY PEOPLE WHO JUST NEVER BEEN MADE WHOLE FROM THE CUTS THEY TOOK MORE THAN A DECADE AGO WITHOUT ALL. CLOSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND CHENEY. THANK YOU AIR INTERCHANGE DOES MAKE ANY SENSE THANKS AGAIN FOR MORE YOU KNOW WHATEVER YOU WHATEVER YOUR NAME IS THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO SAY.

JEANNIE HUSING TRADE OFFS BETWEEN FOOD AND MEDICINE UTILITIES -- AND THAT THAT AND TO CAST IT AND THE SSI EXPANSION A CAL FRESH IS ONLY ONE STEP WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE GRANTS THANK YOU THANK YOU [inaudible] AND FROM.

THEN YOU WILL UNDERSTAND AND VOTE YES BECAUSE I WAS SCARED WHEN I HEARD THERE I WAS A STATIC WITH THERE'D BE GIVEN US FOOD STAMPS.

I WANT TO THANK -- BEVERLY WESTBROOK FOR COMING WITH THE THE FIFTY ADVOCATES AND I THANK YOU FOR GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE THIS ITEM FORWARD SO THAT YOU WE COULD GET YOUR INPUT. WE'RE GOING TO GO INTO ITEM NUMBER [inaudible] SEVEN IMPLEMENTATION OVERSIGHT FOR EXPANSION OF CALPERS BENEFITS. TO SS I SS P. RECIPIENTS GOVERNOR'S B. C. P. AND ASSOCIATED ADVOCACY PROPOSALS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- WE'RE PLEASED TO PRESENT ON THIS -- AND WITH BEING -- HERE -- INTRODUCED HER JUST MOMENTS CAN CAN THE COR WAYS -- THE HEAD OF OUR CAL FRESH -- BENEFITS -- BRANCH -- THE VIN TALK ABOUT THE RBC P. REQUEST IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT THE EXTENSION OF CALPERS BENEFITS TESTS ARE RECIPIENTS WHICH OCCURRED LAST YEAR'S BUDGET AND HOW WHAT'S ROLLING OUT AND HOW WE'RE IMPLEMENTING IT. INTEREST ALSO GUESTS PLEASE ALL RIGHT -- SO. YES LET'S DO THAT ALL RIGHT GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU THANK YOU I WOULD LIKE A BRIEF UPDATE ON THE IMPLEMENTATION STATUS OR OKAY GREAT SO WE ARE THRILLED TO BE -- AS YOU HEARD FROM THE WONDERFUL PUBLIC TESTIMONY TO BE -- EXPANDING CAL FRESH THIS SUMMER TWO PEOPLE RECEIVING SSI FIRST TIME EVER IN HISTORY THE SS I PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA THE LAST STATE IN THE COUNTRY TO DO SO. SO IT'S A MAJOR -- ACHIEVEMENT -- IN POLICY AND NOW IT'S UP TO US ALL MAKE IT HAPPEN SO BEGINNING JUNE FIRST WE'VE BEEN PARTNERING WITH THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AND ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY. HUMAN SERVICE AGENCIES. AND THE ABBOTT THE COAST A COALITION OF CLIENT ADVOCATES CALIFORNIANS FOR SSI TO PLAN IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY. GOT OUT THE GATE EARLY LAST SUMMER WITH POLICY GUIDANCE IN THE AUTOMATION WORK BEGAN. AFTER THAT TURN TO THE OPERATIONAL PLANNING WITH A FRAMEWORK INVOLVING ALL STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT CALL CLICK COMMAND. TO MAKE SURE LOTS OF DOORS ARE OPEN FOR OUR TO BUT ALL LANGUAGES AND ALL ACCOMMODATIONS READY. AND WE ARE GETTING READY NOW TO KICK OFF OUT REACH WILL BE HAVING OUR BIG KICK OFF DAY IN ABOUT A MONTH APRIL TWENTY FIFTH. SPEND THE MONTH MAIN MAILING PEOPLE ON SSI IN THE BEGINNING JUNE FIRST BEGINNING TO ACCEPT APPLICATIONS. PLANNING HAS GONE WELL WE WILL BE EXPECTING A SIGNIFICANT VOLUME -- COME THIS SUMMER SIMILAR TO A CA HEALTH CARE EXPANSION SO THERE WILL BE THE CHALLENGES THAT COME WITH ONBOARDING -- HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TO A NEW PROGRAM IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. BUT WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING THROUGH THOSE ISSUES MANAGING THOSE ISSUES AND COMING OUT THE OTHER SIDE WITH LOTS MORE NUTRITION AND HEALTH SUPPORT. FOR OUR STATE AND FOR OUR NEIGHBORS. THAT'S THE BRIEF IS UPDATE ON THE IMPLEMENTATION PLANNING UNLESS THERE'S QUESTIONS ON THAT AND THEN I GUESS THERE IS A B. C. P. TO SUPPORT STATE STAFF. REALLY IN THREE AREAS THE CASELOADS GONNA EXPAND BY ABOUT ADDITIONAL MONITORING IN CASE REVIEWS. THIS ALSO WAS GOING TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OUR ELDERLY AND DISABLED -- BECAUSE DEPENDS WHO DO HAVE SEPARATE FEDERAL RULES THAT ALLOW FOR HIGHER SHELTER COSTS AS WE HEARD ABOUT HIGHER MEDICAL COSTS AND SO THERE'S SOME MORE POLICY. TRAINING AGAIN AT A WORK TO DO TO MAKE SURE OUR PROGRAM IS MEETING ALL NEEDS. AND THEN -- THERE ARE TWO NEW STATE. FOR THOSE FAMILIES WHO ARE ALREADY ON CAL FOR OCEAN MAKES PERRANCE A DECREASE OR A LOSS OF CALPERS BENEFITS. THIS IS THE SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION BENEFIT PROGRAM IN THE TRANSITIONAL NUTRITION BENEFIT PROGRAM ES AND THE T. M. B. AND DOES REQUIRE SOME NEW STATE STAFF FOR ACCOUNTING AND TRACKING -- AT THAT NEW STATE FUNDED BENEFITS SO. IN SHORT THAT'S WHERE WE ARE. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LEE SHONDA DAY X. ON HERE TODAY REPRESENTING LOS ANGELES COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SOCIAL SERVICES WHY AM THE CHIEF OF OUR CALPERS POLICY DIVISION. I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY ABOUT THE COUNTIES IMPLEMENTATION PLAN OF THE CALPERS EXPANSION PRESSES AYE RECIPIENTS. WE HAVE DEVELOPED A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN THAT CONTAINS A ROLE WITHIN OUR REACH STRATEGIES AND A ROBUST COMMUNICATION PLAN TO SUPPORT CONNECTING SSI RECIPIENTS TO CALPERS BENEFITS IN LA COUNTY. WE ESTIMATE THE OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SS I RECIPIENTS NOW LAKE COUNTY ARE POTENTIALLY ELIGIBLE FOR CALIFORNIA SHOULD BEGINNING JUNE FIRST. TOTALLY -- EFFECTIVELY ADDRESSES POPULATION DPSS WILL EMPLOY TARGETED STRATEGIES FOR THREE MAIN CATEGORIES OF SS I SS P. INDIVIDUALS. WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR CALPRS BENEFITS THE FIRST CATEGORY CONSISTED OF APPROXIMATELY FORTY TWO THOUSAND SS I SS P. INDIVIDUALS CURRENTLY KNOWN TO ACTIVE CAO FRESH? FROM HOUSEHOLD. SO THESE ARE THE HOUSEHOLDS THAT AND CAN THE CALPERS CASE. FOR THESE ACTIVE CALPERS HOUSE SO THE DEPARTMENT HAS ECSTATIC SPECIALIZE UNITS IN EACH DISTRICT OFFICE THAT WILL -- ASSISTANT ADDING THE SS I SS P. RECIPIENT TO THE COW FIRST CASE AND EVALUATE THE AMPLE ONGOING ELIGIBILITY FOR CALIBRATION DURING YOUR PERIODIC REPORTING WE VIEW. THE SECOND CATEGORY IS OUR IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES POPULATION. OUR DATA SHOWS THAT -- OVER A HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND OR 74% OF OUR I JUST AS CASE LITTLE ALSO RECEIVE SS I SS P.. SO FOR THESE HOUSEHOLDS BUT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS LEVERAGE OUR IN HOME SUPPORT IS -- SUPPORTIVE SERVICES WORKERS SO DURING THE INTAKE IN THE REASSESSMENT PROCESS THE I JUST AS SOCIAL WORKERS WELL INFORMED THAT I JUST AS RECIPIENTS OF THE NEW -- CASH -- POLICY AND HELP THEM CONNECT TO CAO FRESH BENEFITS. SO THAT THEIR MAIN CATEGORY IS COMPRISED OF SS I SS P. RECIPIENTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY NOT KNOWN TO OUR SYSTEM. SO FOR THIS POPULATION WE WILL FORMULATE AND STRENGTH IN EXISTING PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY BASED IN PHASE -- BASED ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTY DEPARTMENTS TO HELP US GET THE WORD OUT AND CONNECT -- SS I SS P. INDIVIDUALS TO CAL OUR REACH PLAN WELL AT THE VERY TOP IN THE CASE [inaudible] ON WHICH TARGETED INFORMATIONAL NOTICES -- PASS ALONG CARDS I'LL BONE BECAUSE IN TEXT MESSAGING SOCIAL MEDIA AND WEBSITE PROMOTION INTEGRATED VOICE RESPONSE MESSAGES ON BE OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER. ADDITIONALLY ALL OF OUR WHICH MATERIALS WILL BE SHARE WITH THE COMMUNITY FOR DISSEMINATION BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS WAR GETS OUT -- TO SS I SS P. RECIPIENTS WHO ARE POTENTIALLY ELIGIBLE. NOW WHAT ARE THESE EFFORTS -- WILL LIKELY RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN AND BY YOU ABOUT THE CATIONS TO ALL OF OUR ACCESS CHANNELS. AND WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT WORKLOAD IMPACT FOR OUR STAFF IN IT WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL STAFFING. SO SHOULD THESE EFFORTS RESORT AND I DEPARTMENT HAVING OVER OVERFLOWING ARE LOBBIES WE HAVE DEVELOPED A CONTINGENCY PLAN WHICH INCLUDES -- MAKING SURE OUR OFFICES ARE PROPERTY RESOURCE STE WE ARE EXPANDING OUR INTAKE CALL CENTERS HE WE AUGUST INSTALLING ADDITIONAL PHONES IN THE DISTRICT OFFICES SO THAT CLIENTS CAN CALL THE CALL CENTER. IN APPLY FOR A CAL FRESH OVER THE PHONE SO WE DO HAVE A VERY GOOD PROCESS IN PLACE SO IF YOU -- YOU GO APPLY FOR CAO FRESH OVER THE PHONE IN THE OF ARE THE DOCUMENTATION VERIFICATION IS AVAILABLE WE CAN APPROVE YOUR APPLICATION THE SAME DAY IN ISSUE YOU ARE EBT CARD SO THAT'S A GREAT THING. SO IN CLOSING I WOULD JUST LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS IS JUST A SNAPSHOT OF OUR EFFORTS TO OUR ROLE AS THE SCIENCES PVC PANTS AND CAL FOR ASH. AND WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT OUR OUR REACH EFFORTS IN OUR PLAN WILL YOU YIELD VERY -- SUCCESSFUL RESULTS. SO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS I'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER. THANK YOU. THERE MAY BE SOME LATER. WE'RE GONNA LISTEN TO ALL THE PANELISTS FIRST. AS LAID OUT IN YOUR AGENDA ON PAGE -- TWENTY EIGHT OUR OFFICE IT SEEMS LIKE THE DEPARTMENT ALONG WITH STAKEHOLDERS DONE A LOT WHEN IT CAME WHEN IT COMES TO PLANNING -- FOR THE EXPANSION OF CALIFORNIA WE JUST RAISED A NUMBER QUESTION IN TERMS OF ONCE JUNE FIRST HEADS WHAT'S THE FOLLOW UP FOR THE LEGISLATURE THAT IMPLEMENTATION FOLLOW UP -- QUESTIONS ARE LAID OUT IN YOUR AGENDA YOUR STAFF COMMENT WERE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOUR STAFF TO SEE WHAT ROLE WE COULD PLAY. IN COORDINATING FACILITATING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND STAKEHOLDER WHAT THAT FOLLOW UP COULD LOOK LIKE AND THROUGH WHAT AVENUE IT COMES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FRANK MAC WITH THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION ARE SO SEE ATION. HAS BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH CDSS AND THE MANY ADVOCATE PARTNERS INCLUDING -- THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS AND THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IN THE PARTNERSHIP HAS BEEN REALLY EXCELLENT. AND THE STATE'S LEADERSHIP IN THIS REGARD HIS BAND STELLAR AND SO WE'VE BEEN. INCREDIBLY PLEASED WITH ALL THE WORK THAT EVERYONE'S BEEN DOING VERY COLLABORATIVELY WE'VE ALSO BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE AUTOMATION CONSORTIA -- THE THE STATE WHAT AUTOMATED WELFARE SYSTEM CONSORTIA TO MAKE SURE THAT THE WORKERS HAVE PROPER AUTOMATION SUPPORT -- IN ORDER TO MEET THE JUNE FIRST IMPLEMENTATION DEADLINE AND SUPPORT COUNTY WORKERS. WE'RE HAPPY TO REPORT SO FAR THAT IMPLEMENTATION IS GENERALLY GOING WELL AND WE'VE NOT ENCOUNTERED. ANY MAJOR PROBLEMS ARE BARRIERS. YOU'VE HEARD SO FAR A LITTLE SNAPSHOT OF THE INCREDIBLE OUTREACH ACTIVITIES -- THAT COUNTIES IN THE STATE HAVE BEEN ENGAGE LIKELY BE TO CLOSE TO THE FOUR ONE POINT TWO MILLION PEOPLE ON SSI. BUT BROUGHT OUT REACH IS A TERRIFIC STRATEGY FOR ENROLLING ALL ELIGIBLE SSI RECIPIENTS. BUT ALSO LEADS I THINK TO OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPLEMENTATION IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGE AND THAT'S PROCESSING A VERY LARGE VOLUME OF APPLICATIONS IN A VERY SHORT. WINDOW OF TIME -- WE WENT THROUGH US SOMEWHAT COMPARABLE IMPLEMENTATION WHEN WE IMPLEMENTED THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. AND PUT MILLIONS OF MORE PEOPLE ON SUBSIDIZED HEALTH CARE THAN BEFORE ME LEARNED MANY LESSONS FROM THAT EXPERIENCE. AND THE BIGGEST LESSON WE LEARNED WAS THAT THE UNANTICIPATED VOLUME -- CREATED ARE OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND SO THAT LEADS -- TO OUR BUDGET REQUEST ON THIS REGARD OUR BUDGET REQUEST FALLS INTO TWO CATEGORIES THE FIRST IS A ONE TIME ASK A FIVE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS -- TO PROCESS THE APPLICATION VOLUME. THE BUDGET CURRENTLY INCLUDES FUNDING TO PROCESS APPLICATIONS FOR THE ANTICIPATED THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO WILL BE FOUND ELIGIBLE. BUT THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE FUNDING FOR THE APPLICATIONS FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO DO APPLY BUT WHO ULTIMATELY ARE NOT -- ELIGIBLE AND GIVEN THE EXPANSE OF AN EXCELLENT OUT REACH WE DO EXPECT THAT IN CASTING THE NET AS WIDE AS POSSIBLE THERE WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT VOLUME FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ULTIMATELY NOT FOUND ELIGIBLE. AND THIS ONE TIME POT OF MONEY WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE STAFF IN THE ABILITY TO SUPPORT THE ACTIVITIES LIKE THOSE. THAT YOU'VE HEARD IN LOS ANGELES AND SO THAT WE EXTREMELY VULNERABLE PEOPLE WAITING IN COUNTY LOBBIES ARE WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO ANSWER THE TELEPHONE TO GET BENEFITS THAT COULD LITERALLY BE LIFESAVING. THE SECOND PART OF OUR ASK IS AN ON GOING. THE FUNDING OF TEN POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND AND THIS IS A PRETTY SIMPLE REQUEST. WE CAME TO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE STATE LAST YEAR TO ESTIMATE HOW MUCH WORK IS IT REALLY GOING TO BE FOR COUNTIES ON AN ONGOING BASIS. TO HANDLE THIS NEW PROGRAM. THE JANUARY BUDGET FUNDS THAT ASSUMPTION. BUT IT FUNDS IT AS IF IT WERE THE YEAR. TWO THOUSAND ONE SO THE UNIT COST TO THAT THE COUNTIES ARE BEING FUNDED FOR IS THE ACTUAL THE FISCAL YEAR TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND ONE UNIT COST. THAT IS A VESTIGE OF A RECESSION ERA. WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT OUR BUDGET SO WE'RE JUST GONNA NOT ON THE COUNTIES THAT THEIR ACTUAL COSTS. AND IT'S A HOLDOVERS FROM FROM FROM -- A BY GONE ERA AND IT'S NOT AT ALL REFLECTIVE I THINK OF THE CURRENT COMMITMENT TO EVERYONE AROUND THIS TABLE THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE. EXPECT FOR US TO IMPLEMENT THIS PROGRAM CHANGE IF WE REALLY ARE GOING TO COMMIT. TO IMPLEMENT THIS BENEFIT IN THE WAY THAT WE ALL AGREE IT NEEDS TO BE IMPLEMENTED WE CAN'T FUND 60% OF THE WORK AND WE ARE WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. AND HELP THAT THAT GETS ADDRESSED IN THE MAY REVISION THANK YOU. MY OUT EARLIER THANK YOU -- MY CAROL AGAIN WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY -- JUST AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TAKING -- SS I RECIPIENTS AND THE FOLKS WHO HAD TRAVELED FROM OUT OF TOWN -- EARLY IN THE AGENDA IT'S GREATLY APPRECIATED AND SO GLAD THAT WE'RE ABLE TO HEAR FROM THEM TODAY -- SO I'M GOING TO PILE ON ON ALL THE PRAISE THAT YOU'RE HEARING -- FOR THE WORK OF THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES AND FOR THE COUNTIES --% IT REALLY HAS BEEN A GREAT COLLABORATIVE I HAVE BEEN TEASING MY COLLEAGUE CAM QUITE WAY THAT WE DON'T WANT THIS TO GO TO HER HEAD. SHE YOU KNOW WE STILL HAVE A JOB TO DO AND AND JUNE FIRST IS STILL JUNEFIRST SO. WE'RE ALL VERY HOPEFUL LOW WE THINK THAT WE HAVE DONE AS GOOD A JOB IN PREPARATION THAT I'VE EXPERIENCED IN MY YEARS OF BEING AN ADVOCATE IN SACRAMENTO AND WHILE WE ARE. WE KNOW WE'LL PROBABLY SEE A FEW GLITCHES WE ARE REALLY HOPEFUL AND THE RECIPIENTS AS YOU HEARD MANY OF THEM SPEAK TO IT. ARE REALLY EXCITED VERY EXCITED AND VERY GRATEFUL I THINK FOR THE CHANGE THE LEGISLATURE WAS ABLE TO GET DONE LAST YEAR IN THE BUDGET. SO -- OUR REQUEST -- ARE IT WHEN WE DID THIS LANGUAGE LAST YEAR AS THOSE AND WHO WERE ON THE COMMITTEE AND WORK ON THE BUDGET NO IT CAME TOGETHER FAIRLY LATE IN THE PROCESS -- AND THERE WAS A VERY INTENSE PERIOD OF NEGOTIATION -- IN MAY LAST YEAR -- AND WE WERE ABLE TO GET THE GOVERNOR THIS PROGRAM SO THAT WAS THE LINCHPIN OF THE DEAL COMING TOGETHER WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT. NO FAMILY WHO HAD NECESSARY RECIPIENT WAS ALREADY ON SNAP BENEFITS -- BECAME POORER DUE TO US PROVIDING SNAP BENEFITS TO SS RECIPIENTS AND THAT WAS CRITICAL TO GETTING THE DEAL DONE. I'M IN THE NEGOTIATIONS THAT OCCURRED AROUND THAT THERE WERE SOME THINGS THAT GOT. DECIDED ON THAT I THINK IN RETROSPECT WE MIGHT WANT TO READ THIS AT ALL FIRST OF ALL WE'RE VERY EXCITED THE GOVERNOR CAME RIGHT OUT IN JANUARY. AND MADE THIS A PER PROPOSED TO MAKE THIS A PERMANENT PROGRAM. AND YOU KNOW THAT WAS. FRANKLY ONE OF OUR MAJOR BUDGET ASK COMING INTO THIS YEAR AND SO THE GOVERNOR PUT THAT ON THE TABLE JANUARY ONE WE CERTAINLY EMBRACE AND SUPPORT THAT. WE THINK WITH THAT THEN WE SHOULD ALSO -- ELIMINATE LANGUAGE FROM THE STATUTE NOW THAT SAYS THAT THIS PROGRAM IS NOT AN ENTITLEMENT BECAUSE THAT IS WHY THAT LANGUAGE WAS ADDED WAS BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR WAS ONLY AT THAT POINT WILLING TO COMMIT. A POT OF MONEY HOPEFULLY FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS THAT WOULD DO THAT SO WE ARE ASKING THE LEGISLATURE TO TAKE THOSE ABOUT LANGUAGE OUT ANSWERED OTHER LANGUAGE. BUT AS WE HAVE ANOTHER ALL OUR OTHER PHONE SINCE FOR THE FAMILIES [inaudible] TO I'M DID THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE IS WE PUT ON VERY RESTRICTIVE RULES ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO FAMILIES WHEN THEY FALL OFF THE CASE LOAD -- AS WE KNOW AND CAL FRESH ABOUT COME UP FOR RE DETERMINATION. FALL OFF OF THE CASELOAD AT SOME POINT SO THERE'S A LOT OF TURNOVER IN THE PROGRAM WELL THE WAY THIS PROGRAM IS STRUCTURED ONE OF THEM -- REQUIRES THAT ANYONE A FALSE UP ONLY GET THIRTY DAYS TO REAPPLY AND IF THEY DON'T GET HIM IN THAT. THIRTY EIGHT THAT'S IT THEY LOSE THAT CAL FOR THEY LOSE THAT HOLD HARMLESS BENEFIT FOR EVER -- SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE REVISIT IT AND CHANGE SO THAT THOSE RULES OPERATE JUST LIKE CAL FRESH DOES IF SOMEBODY GOES OFF THEY CAN COME BACK WHEN THEY'RE READY TO REAPPLY GET READ A TERM AND GO BACK ON TO THE HOLD HARMLESS PROGRAMS. AND THEN ONE OTHER THING THAT WE ANOTHER THING THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO GET DONE TO IS -- TO WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEIR BE PERSPECTIVE ENROLLMENT FOR THE SMB IN THE TEAM BE PROGRAMS. ON THE WAY THE PROGRAMS IS WRITTEN OF GREAT STATUES WRITTEN IS IF YOU DO NOT YOU MUST HAVE AN SSI RECIPIENT IN YOUR HOUSEHOLD ON JUNE ONE TWENTY NINETEEN WHEN THE WHEN THE START DATE IS. AND IF YOU DON'T ANY FAMILY THAT COMES AFTER THAT IS BARRED FROM GETTING THESE BENEFITS SO OVER TIME WHAT THIS IS GOING TO CREATE IS A TWO YOU KNOW TO CLASS SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE SOME FOLKS ARE GETTING A LITTLE BIT MORE. INCREASED AT AN EXACT SAME HOUSEHOLD SAME INCOME SAME CONSTRUCTION OR GET A GET LOWER BENEFITS SO WE'RE ASKING THE LEGISLATURE TO REVERSE THAT AND TO HAVE JUST OPENED PERSPECTIVE WE ACTUALLY THINK OVER TIME THIS WATCH WE SIMPLIFY. THE ROLE OF THE COUNTIES WHO HAVE TO MAKE THESE DETERMINATIONS AND KEEP TRACK OF WHO WAS ON THE PROGRAM AND YOU WANT WHO IS NOT ON THE PROGRAM IN JUNE. ONE IT'S REALLY A PAPER CHASE THAT WERE ASKING THE DIFFICULT THIS CHANGE WOULD ELIMINATE ALL THE NEED FOR THAT -- AND THEN LASTLY WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT WE DID MAKE A CHANGE ARE GOOD CHANGE LAST YEAR ALSO WHERE WE ELIMINATED THE TEN DOLLAR GAP BETWEEN CAPPY AND SS I SS BE GRANTS -- BUT THERE'S LANGUAGE IN THERE THAT DOESN'T MAKE THAT PERMANENT AND WE WOULD PROPOSE THAT THAT BE MADE PERMANENT IN THIS BUDGET TRAILER BILL ALSO SO THOSE ARE THE **** OF A OF THE ADVOCATES. AS WE GO FORWARD AGAIN THANK IN THE DEPARTMENT OF THE COUNTIES FOR ALL THEIR INCREDIBLE WORK -- OVER THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS. THANK YOU. AND SHANE THANK YOU SO MUCH BETTER CHAIR -- SO I DID I'M HERE TO SPEAK -- MORE TO THE THEY CALPERS EXPANSION SSI SIDE -- FROM THE OTHER PERSPECTIVE I DO THE WANT TO ACKERMAN ALSO CELEBRATE THIS IS HER EXPANSION IT'S ONLY BEEN A PROFESSIONAL PRIVILEGE OF MINE PEOPLE TO GO TO CONFERENCES AROUND THE COUNTRY. AND REALLY HEAR THE PRAISE TO THE LEGISLATURE TO THE GOVERNOR TO THE TO THE DEPARTMENT AND COUNTIES FOR THE TREMENDOUS WORK FOR CALIFORNIA TO FINALLY GET THIS DONE AND TO DO IN A WAY THAT IS MORE ACCURATE THAN ANY OTHER SEATED WITH A HOLD HARMLESS PROGRAMS AND SO I JUST. WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT MESSAGE IS BROUGHT BACK ON TO THIS ROOM -- SIMILARLY I WANT TO THANK TO DETERMINE IF COUNTIES AND CAT AND COUNTY TO WORKING FOR THE HARD AND ENGAGE AS FULLY AS ADVOCATES WE HAVE BEEN. BROUGHT THAT IS A KEY STAKEHOLDER AND HONESTLY JUNE FIRST -- GO LIVE ON THIS AND I REALLY WANT TO THANK HIM FOR ALL OF THE WORK AND THEIR ENGAGEMENT ON THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AS CAN MENTION BRIEFLY HAS PRODUCED A CLEAR GOAL TO ENROLL 75% OF THE ESTIMATED. FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND OF FOLKS WILL BE FOUND ELIGIBLE TO THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND I'M OUT OF THAT OUT A CASELOAD AND A CLEAR ROADMAP THE FIRST TO GET THERE WITH SUCCESS -- THE FREE MARKET SOLUTIONS LIKE ELECTRIC THE ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE OVER THE PHONE FLEXIBLE INTERVIEWS AT OTHER PROVEN SOLUTIONS THAT WILL BENEFIT NOT JUST FOLKS RUN ASIDE BUT ANYONE WHO'S APPLYING AND TRYING TO REMAIN ON THE COVERAGE PROGRAM. BUT WE KNOW THAT IN THAT SHORT YEAR ESPECIALLY AS MIKE MENTIONED THAT WE INSISTED AS ADVOCATES UPON HAVING TO TO HOLD HOMELESS PROGRAMS WHICH ARE TAKING UP A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE AUTOMATION. TIME AND RESOURCES WE KNOW THAT IT'S GONNA TAKE TIME TO IMPLEMENT THAT THAT FRAMEWORK FOR EXAMPLE MYSTICS MENTION THE GREAT WORK THAT AT LEAST DOING TO EXPAND -- ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE OVER THE PHONE WE KNOW THAT OTHER COUNTIES ARE LOOKING AT EMBRACING A CULTURE OF ELIGIBILITY ETCETERA SOME OF THOSE TAKE FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND SOME OF THEM SIMPLY TAKE TIME TO IMPLEMENT AND TIME IS. IS REALLY OF THE ESSENCE RIGHT NOW AT THE SAME TIME YOU YOU HEARD BRIEFLY ABOUT SOME OF THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES -- MISTER MIKE WAS TALKING ABOUT AND I CERTAINLY WE SAW TODAY EVIDENCE OF THE INCREDIBLE NEEDS THE BARRIERS FOLKS ARE GOING TO HAVE AN APPLYING FOR THIS BENEFIT TRANSPORTATION SOME OF THE LANGUAGE ACCESS ADA COMPLIANT IT IS GOING TO BE A TREMENDOUS CHALLENGE. TO ENROLL AND PROCESS ALL THESE APPLICATIONS -- AND SO ARE ASKED TODAY ON ON THIS SITE ON THE COVERAGE EXPANSION IS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO REMAIN ENGAGED WE CERTAINLY PROVIDED SOME QUESTIONS WHICH REFLECTED THE LA -- HAS AS WELL -- AND I KNOW THAT THE COUNTIES AND STATE THAT ROLLS OFF THE GO THROUGH THIS WHEN I JUNE FIRST THANK YOU -- TO CALL OF TYLER WOULD SO WE CAN MAKE ROOM TIGER WOODS PARMA FINANCE I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A COMMENT AT THIS TIME AND ON A THE PROPOSAL SO THE EXTENT THESE BECOME A PRIORITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE WERE HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN DISCUSSIONS AND PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE.

ALL RIGHT -- DIRECTOR LARRY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FELT WEIRD BERMAN A SOCIAL SERVICES -- AS COLLEGE SEARCH SITTING DOWN HERE QUICKLY -- I JUST WANTED TO REITERATE ONE OF THE ISSUES IF WE START TO TALK ABOUT THE BACKGROUND FIVE FOR THE ELECTRONIC THIS VERIFICATION THAT -- FUTURE VICTIM MENTIONED IN HIS OPENING REMARKS AND AND THAT IS SOME CONFUSION THAT WE HEARD A LOT LAST WEEK DURING OUR SENATE HEARING -- THERE WAS A LOT OF TREPIDATION AND AND CONCERN AND FEAR ON THE PART OF PROVIDERS AND AND CLIENTS -- ABOUT THIS NEW SYSTEM REQUIRING PEOPLE TO CHECK IN AND CHECK OUT EACH DAY AS IF IT WERE A TIME CLOCK. AND AND GIVEN THE NATURE OF OF MY EXPECTATION AND THAT IS NOT. WHAT THE DEPARTMENT IT'S BEEN WORKING WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS TO TRY AND PROPOSED SWITCHES WANTED TO TRY AND A LAY SOME OF THAT FEAR THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE FILLED OUT ON A DAILY BASIS OR IF THAT IS NOT A CONVENIENT OR INAPPROPRIATE OR OR THAT PEOPLE ARE? ABLE TO DO THAT THEY CAN DO IT EVERY TWO DAYS THREE DAYS UP TO ONCE EVERY TWO WEEKS WHEN THEY'RE ACTUALLY DOING IT WE'RE ALSO REALLY TRYING TO CREATE SYSTEMS THAT ALLOW -- FOR CLIENT AND AND I'M SORRY FOR PROVIDER FLEXIBILITY TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE PROVIDERS TO DO IT EITHER THROUGH THE COMPUTER OR BY THE PHONE AND TRYING TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO DO THAT AND THE WAY THAT AGAIN MAKES IT THE EASIEST FOR THEM SO IF THAT'S DOING IT EVERY DAY. THAN THAN THAT IS THAT THE BEST THE MOST APPROPRIATE WAY AND SO WITH THAT I'M GONNA TRANSFER THIS TRANSITION BACK TO PETE THANK YOU. SEC THANK YOU -- YOU HAVE A A FROM US -- ANOTHER POWER POINT PRESENTATION ON THE HATCH IS AS PROGRAM I'M ALSO NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH THAT ONE FOR YOU BUT I WILL POINT YOU. ADD TO THE DISCUSSION THAT BEGINS ON PAGE SEVENTEEN OF THAT DOCUMENT. IT SIMPLY PROVIDES THE ACTUAL FEDERAL REQUIREMENT FOR THIS -- AND AS DIRECTOR -- ACTING DIRECTOR LARRY SAD SEEN A PAPER TIME SHEET WITH EITHER AN INTERNET BASED OPTION OR A TELEPHONE OPTION FOR THOSE TIME SHEETS. THEY'LL BE A MOBILE TELEPHONE OUT FOR THAT AS WELL -- PAGE EIGHTEEN DESCRIBES THE SIX DATA ELEMENTS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REQUIRES -- WERE LARGELY COMPLIANT WITH THAT EXCEPT FOR THE TWO THAT ARE ASTERIX -- THEY WANT THE TIME THAT THE SIR -- SERVICES FOR THE DAY BEGAN AND ENDED AND THEY WANT THE LOCATION OF THOSE SERVICES -- ARE PROVIDED ALL REITERATE BRIEFLY -- DID THAT -- AS I SAID IN MY OPENING REMARKS THAT LOCATION DATA IS THREE CHECKED BOXES IT'S IN HOME AND COMMUNITY OR BOTH. SO WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE NOT ASKING ANYBODY TO BE TRACKED AND MONITORED OR FOLLOWED AROUND OR HAVE SOME. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GO EXERCISE AND FALLS WHERE YOU'VE BEEN THAT'S NOT AT ALL WHAT WE'RE AFTER HERE. THERE'S SOME GUIDING PRINCIPLES ON PAGE NINETEEN THAT HAVE BEEN PART OF EVERY RIG STAKEHOLDER -- ENGAGEMENT THAT WE'VE HAD -- THAT OBVIOUSLY CONSISTENT -- THAT WE'RE USING OUR EXISTING ELECTRONIC SERVICES PORTAL -- AND OUR EXISTING TELEPHONE TIME SHEETS SYSTEM AS THE PLATFORM FOR COMPLIANCE THESE ARE FAMILIAR TOOLS THERE WILL BE -- ASKING PEOPLE TO EXPAND THEIR USE OF WE'RE COMMITTED TO ADEQUATE TRAINING IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALL OF THESE FUNCTIONALITY IS THERE'S BEEN HEAVY STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT THROUGHOUT THE STATE WITH THE UNIONS AND PROVIDERS. AND WITH RECIPIENTS -- ALTHOUGH NOBODY WOULD EVERYBODY I THINK WOULD PREFER NOT TO BE DOING ANY TV THAT RECOGNIZE THE GIVEN THE FEDERAL MANDATE WE'RE DOING THE ABSOLUTE BEST THAT WE POSSIBLY CAN IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE. AND WE'RE REALLY GRATEFUL FOR THE PART -- PARTNERSHIP IN DEVELOPING THOSE PAGE TWENTY PROVIDES A SCHEDULE OF THE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES -- WE WILL BE ROLLING OUT WAS STAKEHOLDERS OUR NEXT -- LARGE STAKEHOLDER MEETING -- IS MARCH TWENTY NINE OF THIS MONTH -- WHERE WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT AN IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE -- THAT BEGINS JULY FIRST -- WITH WITH THESE TOOLS AND MOVES THROUGH -- THIS IS GOING TO BE HERE OF A WE DON IN A ROLLING MANNER ACROSS THE STATE SIMILAR TO THE WAY WE'VE DONE MANY CHANGES IN OUR PROGRAM. YOU CAN'T DO BIG BANG WITH ONE POINT THREE MILLION PEOPLE WE KNOW THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO TRY -- I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS -- THAT OUR COMMITMENT TO STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AS LONG STANDING ON GOING HERE THIS NEEDS TO WORK WE KNOW THAT IT'S A BIG CHANGE FOR PEOPLE IN THE WAY THAT THE PROGRAM IS DEATH -- HISTORICALLY DONE ITS BUSINESS. WE THINK THERE ARE SOME SIDE BENEFITS LIKE TAKING PAPER OUT OF THE TIME SHE PROCESS IMPROVES THE SPEED OF OUR PAYROLL PROCESS FOR EXAMPLE SO THERE ARE SOME ANCILLARY BENEFITS -- BUT WE'RE ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO DOING THIS IN A WAY THAT MEETS BOTH THE FEDERAL NEED AS WELL AS THE NEEDS OF THE CONSUMERS AND PROVIDERS THAT RELY ON US. TO MEET THE BASICS OF THEIR DAILY -- ACTIVITIES [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] SYDNEY TANIMOTO. SENATE HAVE A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE MINISTRATIONS PROPOSAL THANK YOU. CHECK APRIL. ZERO NO CONCERNS AT THIS TIME OKAY CAN WELCOME BEVERAGE THIS TYPE HI MICHELLE ROSY CONSUMER ADVOCATE -- EVEY V. OF STATUTORY PROTECTIONS AND OUTREACH ACTIVITIES THE COALITION LAST YEAR REACHED AGREEMENT. I WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND LANGUAGE OF THE SENATE BILL EIGHT FORTY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WHICH INCLUDED REPORT PROTECTIONS FOR HSS CLIENTS. AND PROVIDERS AGAINST UNNECESSARY BURDEN INTRUSION AS THIS STATE DEVELOPED ITS EBV PROTOCOLS. WE RESPECTIVELY -- SOLICITORS TAKE FURTHER STEPS TO ENSURE THE SAME PROTECTIONS OF THE WELFARE INSTITUTIONS CODE SO THAT THEY BECOME PERMITTED. THE GOVERNOR'S BUZZER POSES. TEN POINT FOUR MILLION TOTAL FUNDING FOR EBV OUTREACH ACTIVITIES BY COUNTY PUBLIC AUTHORITIES CONSUMER ORGANIZATIONS HSS UNIONS WE'RE WAITING ON CDS TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION OTHER SECTIONS FOR THE BUDGET PROPOSAL SO THAT. WE HAVE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS THE WHO ARE BLIND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES TAKE AWAY FROM HAVING A PAPER SYSTEM. WILL -- TAKE AWAY FROM THEIR ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO DO THE TIME SHEETS IN SOME CASES AND THE CURRENT FUSS SYSTEM HAS A LOT TO BE FIXED WHEN IT COMES TO USE IT IF FOR EASY V.. EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE TAKING AWAY THE PAPER SYSTEM. THAT RECIPIENT VITAL STILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO PRINT PAST TIME SHEETS AND KEEP THEIR RECORDS. AND CDS AS HAS MET MOST OF THE REQUESTED REGARDING COPIES IT HAD HAD A RECORD DALY TYPE SHE'S SO FIRST. FUNDING FOR EDUCATION A SENIORS AND OTHERS WHO ARE AFRAID OF COMPUTERS IS GREATLY NEEDED. I CAN'T EMPHASIZE THIS ENOUGH A LOT OF OUR SENIORS AND IT NOT ONLY IN BIG CITIES BUT RURAL AREAS JUST DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO COMPUTERS. AND OR A SYSTEM THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO NOW IMPLEMENT TO TAKE US AWAY FROM OUR PAPER IMPLEMENTATION FOR EBV -- SO HOW WE DO OUR OUTREACH TO THESE GROUPS IS GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT. THE INFINITE LEVIN IMPLANTATION OVER ALL OVER ALL HAVING SUCCESS OUT SUCCESSFUL OUTCOMES FOR RECIPIENTS AND THE PROVIDERS. THERE IS GOING TO BE STILL BE MANY ISSUES THAT WILL NEED TO BE JOINTLY WORKED OUT WITH CONSUMER GROUPS -- A AND I ATE I REALLY WANT TO SAY THAT THEY REALLY HAVE REACHED OUT TO OUR CONSUMER GROUPS AND I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THAT. BUT SO MUCH MORE IS NEEDED AT THE END I CAN'T THERE'S WE NEED TO BE THAT WHAT I'VE WHAT EDUCATION WITH OUR CONSUMERS ARE PROVIDERS. BECAUSE WE ARE SWITCHING AWAY FROM THE PAPER OF OF TIME SHEET SYSTEM. THE I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH THAT THAT THAT REALLY NEEDS TO HAPPEN. AND IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN A BIGGER WAY THAN WE HAVE EVER DONE BEFORE THANK YOU THANK YOU. YES MS RUBIO I JUST WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT ON THAT BECAUSE I'M DRIVING NUMBER LAST YEAR AND I DON'T MAY MAY NOT HAVE BEEN THE SAME ISSUE BY. BUT WE WERE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE THE PAPER TIME SHEETS I REMEMBER THAT A GROUP CAME AND THAT THEY WERE SENDING IN THE TIME SHEETS AND THEY WERE GETTING PAID FOR A MONTH IN ADVANCE SOMETIME SHEETS WERE. YOU KNOW CONSIDERED LATE IT WAS A BIG -- MESSEL I I AGREE WITH YOU THAT WE HAVE TO DO THE EDUCATION BUT I THINK THIS IS A BETTER SYSTEM BECAUSE I REMEMBER LAST YEAR THERE WAS A WHOLE BUNCH OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT. THE TIME SHEETS NOT ONLY BEING OUTDATED BY THE FOLKS WERE NOT BEING PAID ON TIME SO IF WE CAN WORK TOGETHER ON ON HOW. TO YOU KNOW STREAMLINED THAT SYSTEM AND YOU'RE RIGHT EDUCATE THE COMMUNITY THE COMMUNITY OR THE FOLKS ARE GONNA BE AFFECTED BY THE YOU KNOW ON OUR SIDE I HEARD THE COMPLAINTS ABOUT. YOU KNOW THE TIME SHEETS NOT BEING EFFECTIVE AND AND BEING LOST IN PEOPLE NOT GETTING PAID ON TIME SO FOR ME THE CONCERN. IS IS YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY FOR THE IT COMMUNITY EDUCATION RIGHT THINK THIS MIGHT BE A BETTER SYSTEM SO THAT FOLKS GET PAID ON TIME [inaudible] ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY. YEAH. THEY'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT A PHONE SYSTEMS AT THAT TAKING AWAY FROM THE PLACES THAT CURRENT FILE SYSTEM IS NOT A REALLY GOOD. SYSTEM SO WHATEVER THEY DO AND WHAT IS THE PROBABLY EIGHTY MAYBE IT THE PHONE SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE WORKED ON A FIXED FOR IT TO BE INCLUDED IN THAT EBV SYSTEM. TO SELL IT ALL AROUND IT THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT MORE WORK TO DO BEFORE THEY DESERVE TO LIVE. ABSOLUTELY AND I THINK IF I'M HEARING YOU TO BE PATIENT BECAUSE WE KNOW WITH ANY BIG CHANGES LIKE THAT THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE PROBLEMS IN THE BEGINNING AND SO WHEN I DO ASK IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS PLEASE LET US KNOW DON'T LET US HERE. YOU KNOW ABOUT THE ISSUES YOU KNOW AND COMMITTEE ON LET US KNOW KEEP US -- IN THE LOOP ON HOW IT'S GOING BECAUSE MY LAST THING WE WANT IS TO BE BE HERE NEXT MARTIN HERE BUT ALL THESE. ISSUES NOT BEING ADDRESSED A GREAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND NOW I BELIEVE RANDY WOLF IS GOING TO INTRODUCE CONNIE BARKER. I BRANDY WILL FIND THE STATEWIDE POLICY DIRECTOR FOR SEIU LOCAL TWENTY FIFTEEN AS MENTIONED EARLIER WE REPRESENT ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND I HSS PROVIDERS IN. THIRTY SEVEN OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES -- CONNIE PARKER IS HERE A PROVIDER FROM MARIN COUNTY TO TESTIFY ON THE DVD. THANK YOU AS WELL. THANK YOU -- BEFORE'S READING MY PREPARED REMARKS I JUST WANT TO ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH EVERY WORD SHE SAID ABOUT PAPER TIME SHEETS AND THE THE ISSUES THAT THE TRANSIT THAT THAT TRANSITION IS GOING. TO CREATE FOR EVERYONE AND ABOUT THAT THIS FUNCTIONALITY OF THE CURRENT PHONE SYSTEM -- THE SERVER. YOU KNOW. THAT THE THESE ARE WHAT I WAS PREPARED TO SPEAK ON BUT AS LONG AS SOMEONE SAID IT I'M GOING TO SAVE A YOUNG MAN OKAY. HI -- SO MY NAME IS CONNIE BURKE FROM AND I JUST AS PROVIDER IN MARIN COUNTY ALSO WORK IN SANTA CLARA -- OUR UNION -- AS HE MAINE'S STRONGLY OPPOSED TO EA VV I WANT TO SAY THAT FIRST JUST SO THAT THERE'S NO IT HOME CONFUSION ABOUT THAT WITH OUR MEMBERS -- BUT WE'RE WELL AWARE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S ONGOING REQUIREMENTS ABOUT SUCH REGULATIONS WHICH UNFORTUNATELY. A DEPENDING ON HOW THEY ARE ROLLED OUT CAN VIOLATE THE PRIVACY OF BOTH HOME CARE RECIPIENTS AND ALSO PROVIDE THEIR CARE. AND WHICH IN MANY PLACES ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE ALREADY COMPROMISING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO MEET THE PERSONAL ASSISTANCE NEEDS OF THIS NATION SENIOR SOME PEOPLE'S WITH THIS A BIT AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. NEEDS WHICH WHICH IT IS THEIR RIGHT UNDER THE OLMSTEAD DECISION TO HAVE MET IN THEIR OWN HOMES. FOR THIS REASON IT IS VITAL THAT THE PROTECTIONS FOR CONSUMERS AND PROVIDERS -- AS REGARDING EVEY V. WHICH CALIFORNIA'S SO WISELY AND APPROPRIATELY ADOPTED LAST YEAR AS PART OF THE BUDGET BILL BECAUSE OF FIGHT INTO LAW THIS YEAR. TO REVIEW. THESE PROJECTS -- PROTECTIONS INCLUDED SUCH THINGS AS SEEN TO IT THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS DEBATE CONTINUES TO BE DEVELOPED THROUGH A COLLABORATIVE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. THAT IT BE DONE IN A WAY THAT IS IS MINIMALLY BURDENSOME AS POSSIBLE TO PROVIDERS AND CONSUMERS -- THAT THE RIGHTS OF THE IN HOME SUPPORT SERVICES CONSUMERS UNDER OLMSTEAD ARE ABSOLUTELY REGARDED AS NON NEGOTIABLE AND THAT NO PROGRAM IN INCREASE -- IMPLEMENTATION CAN BE ALLOWED TO INFRINGE THEM PERIOD EVER. THAT'S JUST BOTTOM LINE -- WE ALSO WANT TO KEEP WITH THE AGREEMENT THAT GEO TRACKING AND GPS SYSTEMS WOULD NOT BE USED. AND THAT THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE DEVELOPED IN A WAY THAT CONTINUES -- TO USE MAXIMUM FLEX THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DEFINITIONS OF WHAT CAN BE TERMED PERSONAL CARE SERVICES LOCATION OF SERVICES AND START AND TIME OF EACH SERVICE. AS YOU KNOW AS THE DEPARTMENT HAS ALREADY DISCUSSED. ADDITIONALLY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES -- WAS INSTRUCTED NOT TO CREATE ADDITIONAL VIOLATIONS POLICIES AS PART OF EBV. AND AND AGREED THAT -- INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER ASSESSMENTS WOULD CONTINUE TO BE DONE ANNUALLY BY SOCIAL WORKERS AND THAT INFORMATION FROM ANY IN PVP SYSTEMS WOULD NOT SUBSTITUTE FOR HUMAN VISITS AND WOULD NEVER BE USED TO REDUCE THE CONSUMERS HOURS. NOW AS I SAID CALIFORNIA'S ACOSTA COURSE NOT THE ONLY STATE DEALING WITH THESE ISSUES AND A LOT OF THOSE PROTECTIONS ARE IN THERE BECAUSE OF WHAT WE'VE SEEN GOING ON IN OTHER STATES AND OUR DESIRE TO AVOID THOSE PROBLEMS HERE. BUT STATES ACROSS THE NATION AS THEY GRAPPLE WITH THIS ARE CONTINUING TO LOOK TO US TO SET A STANDARD AN EXAMPLE TO FOLLOW AND AGAIN THE WE REMAIN ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO FIGHTING EBV AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. IF CALIFORNIA IS FORCED IMPLEMENTED ON SCHEDULE THESE STRONG PROTECTIONS WILL NEED TO BE IN PLACE TO PROVIDE A MUCH NEEDED MEASURE OF PROTECTION FOR THE PROGRAM. FOR THE CONSUMERS REQUIRE ITS CARE AND FOR THE PROVIDERS TO MAKE THAT CARE POSSIBLE THEREFORE CODIFYING THEM INTO LAW NOW IS A NECESSARY STEP. AND ONE THAT THE STATE SHOULD ABSOLUTELY SHOULD TAKE THANK YOU. I THINK THATEM STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION -- DOES CALL FOR THE PROTECTION AS YOU NOTED TO THE CONSUMERS AND THE PROVIDERS. THE PRIVACY -- I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE BRINGING THIS UP I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE PROBLEMS WITH THE CHANGING FROM THE PAPER. TO TO THE COMPUTER -- IT ISN'T TO FAIL PROOF METHOD AND AS MS RUBIO IS INDICATED THAT SOMETHING THAT WE WILL GO THROUGH BUT I DO WANT. TO THANK THE DEPARTMENT OF THE ADMINISTRATION EFFORTS MADE. ESPECIALLY IT INVITING AND INCLUDING THE STAKEHOLDERS -- IT WAS IMPORTANT TO HAVE THEM AT THE TABLE ON THIS PARTICULAR SUBJECT. I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS COLLABORATIVE EFFORT STARTED LAST YEAR AND HAS BEEN ONGOING. I WANT TO THANK YOU AND I I THINK WE CAN ALL APPRECIATE THAT THIS. WHEN YOU BRING STAKEHOLDERS TOGETHER TO ENHANCE IS THE IMPLEMENTATION WORK FOR MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGE THAT WAS THAT CREATED AT FIRST A LOT OF? UNDERSTANDABLE APPREHENSION AND STILL SOME APPREHENSION RIGHT. DID FOR FOR WHAT MY OWN OPINION I WISH IT WAS NOT IMPLEMENTED HERE CALIFORNIA. YEAH. IN ORDER THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE THOáT DOES FACILITATE OUR COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL LAW. AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S THE REASON FOR ALL OF THIS -- WELL NOT CAUSING A WE'RE TRYING TO DO THE BEST WE CAN THE DOESN'T CAUSE UNDUE HARDSHIP TO THE OVER ONE MILLION PEOPLE INVOLVED WITH AND IMPACTED WITH THIS PROGRAM. THE THE ISSUE RELATES ALSO TO ISSUE NUMBER ONE THAT WE DISCUSSED EARLIER IN SOME WAYS ADDRESSING THE IMPORTANCE OF CODIFYING STATE POLICY WHAT MAKES SENSE TO DO. AND IN THIS CASE TO IN TRYING CALIFORNIA'S APPROACH EVD -- AT ONE QUESTION FOR THE ADMINISTRATION IS WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS. ON THIS CODIFICATION APPROACH. OF A COUPLE COMMENTS IF I IF I MAY FIRST TWO A GOOD ANSWER YOUR QUESTION WE HAVE NO OBJECTION TO THE CODIFICATION OF THE POLICY PRINCIPLES THAT HAVE GUIDED OUR WORK WE HELPED IN THE DRAFTING OF THEM LAST YEAR IN THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE AND WE HAVE NO OBJECTION. TO CODIFYING THAT -- WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK ON LANGUAGE UNDERSTAND A REQUEST IS BEEN MADE -- FOR FOR ONE OF THE GROUPS INVOLVED. TO WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK AND DEVELOP THAT LANGUAGE OF THOSE PRINCIPLES ARE IMPORTANT THEIR STANDARD CONTENT. MISSION -- IS ROSY HAVE. ARTICULATED THEM WHILE AND AND WE AGREE THERE IN OUR SLIDE DECK AS WELL SO HAPPY TO DO THAT. ON THE ISSUE THE PHONE WE KNOW IT'S NOT WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE OUR FOCUS HAS BEEN ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ELECTRONIC SERVICES PORTAL ONCE THAT HAS WORKED ITS WAY OUT THAT IS THE MODEL FOR THE FUNCTION THE ORDER OF QUESTIONS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. THAT WILL LEAD NOT JUST TO THE PHONE BUT TO THE MOBILE APP AS WELL. AND ADDITIONALLY RECOGNIZING THE POPULATION WERE SERVING THERE ARE STILL IN THE PROGRAM ABOUT -- FOUR HUNDRED RECIPIENTS AND THAT DON'T HAVE OF EVEN A TELEPHONE NUMBER ON FILE WITH US SO THERE WILL NEED TO BE A SYSTEM. OR SOME MECHANISM TO TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE STILL ABLE TO APPROVE THE TIME SHEETS OF OF THE PEOPLE THAT WORK FOR THEM. SO WE'RE COGNIZANT OF THOSE ISSUES WERE COMMITTED TO WORKING THROUGH IT THAT WILL BE AN ONGOING PARTNERSHIP. AND THE PHONE IS JUST BEHIND THE ELECTRONIC SERVICES PORTAL. WE'VE HAD AN EXTENDED -- NOT TO GET TOO FAR AHEAD OF MEETING WITH STAKEHOLDERS AT THE END OF THE MONTH BUT WE HAVE AN EXTENDED PILOT PERIOD WHERE WHEN WE GO TO IMPLEMENT. NOT ONLY TESTING BEFORE THAT PILOT AND MAKING SURE THINGS WORK BUT LEARNING FROM OUR PILOT EXPERIENCE. THE WAVES THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER WILL BE ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE AT A TIME. WHICH IS A REALLY BIG NUMBER. BUT THAT INITIAL PILOT WILL BE A COUPLE MONTHS SO THAT WE COULD WORK OUT THESE KINGS AND ENSURE THAT SUBSEQUENT WAVES. DON'T EXPERIENCE. IN ANYTHING THIS BIG WE EXPECTED NOT TO BE COMPLETELY CMOS AND WE WANT THE CHANCE TO MAKE IT AS SMOOTH AS POSSIBLE. WONDERFUL WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I APPRECIATE THE COLLABORATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. TO MAKE TWO MORE VERY QUICK FOR MARCH IS A BUDGET HEARING AND I THINK LIKE DID THE INSTRUCTION. THERE'S A B. C. P.

I'M WITH THE ETV STOPPERS WERE MOSTLY IN EAST BAY GROUP BUT THANK YOU CONNIE AND MACHEL -- I PRETTY MUCH WANTED -- EVERYTHING THAT THEY SAID BUT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE THINGS.

TAKE A SELFIE WHILE YOU CAN -- BECAUSE I AM STILL STUCK ON A HORRIBLE. TELEPHONE TIME SHEETS SYSTEM IT'S HORRIBLE. I'M I AM ONE OF THREE BLIND PEOPLE THAT. THE BECAUSE THE STRUCTURE NEGOTIATION. WITH P. R.. AND DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA THAT WORKED WITH THE STATE THAT MADE THAT THING POSSIBLE AND I'M ASHAMED OF IT. WHEN WE FIRST ROLLED IT OUT EVEN BEFORE THE PILOT I TOLD THEM THERE WERE PROBLEMS THOSE PROBLEMS STILL EXIST?

ONE HAD TO DO WITH THE NUMBER OF BACKGROUND CHECKS THAT WERE ASSUMED AN AG ANY GIVEN YEAR THE ASSUMPTION WAS ABOUT FORTY FIVE THOUSAND IF YOU LOOK AT THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN D. O. J. NUMBERS. THERE WERE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO THOUSAND UNDERTAKEN WERE CONTINUING TO DO INTERNAL -- DETERMINATIONS TO FIND OUT -- COUNTY BY COUNTY BY COUNTY -- HOW MANY BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR UNDERTAKEN BUT WE DO THINK THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT AND THERE IS ABOUT A 30% TURNOVER RATE -- IN AYE HSS PROVIDERS AND ANY GIVEN YEAR. SO WITH THE FORTY FIVE THOUSAND ASSUMPTION THAT REALLY WAS BASICALLY LIKE ONE HALF T. E. PER LIKE NINETY FIVE HUNDRED CASES WHICH IS. INSUFFICIENT STATEWIDE SECONDLY THE OTHER ASSUMPTION THAT WAS POINTED OUT IN THE ANALYSIS MY AND ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT -- HAD TO DO WITH REFERRALS AND BASING IT ON ABOUT 8% OF CONSUMERS WHICH REALLY RESULTED IN HAVE TV'S. OF ABOUT THIRTY TWO POINT SIX THREE STATE WIDE AND GIVEN THAT WE HAVE. FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AND FIFTY SIX PUBLIC AUTHORITIES AMONG THOSE COUNTIES THAT'S NOT EVEN. ONE ONE PERSON TO DO THE WORK THAT IS AN ENORMOUS UNDERTAKING AND WORKLOAD SO WE THE THE ANALYSIS I WE THINK WE'RE SHORT WE THINK IT'S ABOUT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WERE DOING A LITTLE BIT MORE FINE TUNING.

TO CONTINUE AND GROW THE TRAINING PROGRAM FOR A PS SOCIAL WORKERS. AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATORS GUARDIANS AND CONSERVATORS. OUR BROAD COALITION IS REQUESTING FIVE POINT SEVEN FIVE MILLION STATE FUNDS OVER THREE YEARS. THIS WORKS OUT TO BE JUST UNDER TWO MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. BUT IT LEVERAGES ANOTHER FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDS. FOR TOTAL INVESTMENT OF TEN FIVE MILLION. UNTIL THREE YEARS AGO THE APEC APS TRAINING PROGRAM WAS SUPPORTED BY A MERE EIGHTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS IN STATE FUNDS. THIS WAS NOT ENOUGH TO MEET JUST MY OWN STAFF TRAINING NEEDS LET ALONE THE TRAINING NEEDS OF ALL SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES WORKERS ACROSS THE STATE. THERE WAS NO TRAINING TO ONBOARD NEW SOCIAL WORKERS OR NEW SUPERVISORS AND NO ADVANCE TRAINING TO ADDRESS THE VERY COMPLEX AND DIVERSE TYPES OF ABUSE AND NEGLECT THAT WE RESPOND TO ON A DAILY BASIS. WITH THE ONE TIME THREE MILLION DOLLAR A PS TRAINING INVESTMENT WHICH GREW TO SIX MILLION DOLLARS WITH FEDERAL MATCH OVER THESE PAST THREE YEARS. WE WERE ABLE TO TRAIN OUR SOCIAL WORK STAFF TO BETTER PROTECT OLDER ADULTS. AND VICTIMS OF ABUSE AND NEGLECT. FOR EXAMPLE MY STAFF NOW HAVE INCREASED THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS TO CONDUCT INITIAL INVESTIGATIONS ASSESS CLIENTS FOR DECISION MAKING ABILITY. COMPLETE FINANCIAL ABUSE INVESTIGATIONS ANSWER VICTIMS WHO HAVE MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE NEEDS.

OUR MEMBERS ARE APPOINTED BY THE CALIFORNIA SUPERIOR COURTS TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MOST IMPAIRED ADULT CALIFORNIANS AND THEY'RE A STATES. I TOO AM REQUESTING YOUR SUPPORT TO CONTINUE THESE FUNDS PRIOR TO THREE YEARS AGO. OUR MEMBERS NEVER RECEIVED ANY TRAINING FUNDS OF ANY KIND. EVEN THOUGH CERTIFICATION IS LEGALLY MANDATED. TRAINING WAS LIMITED TO ONE THREE AND A HALF DAY CONFERENCE HERE AND MANY MEMBERS COULD NOT AFFORD TO ATTEND REGULARLY. THE TRAINING FUNDS ALLOWED US TO DELIVER THIRTY ADDITIONAL TRAININGS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND PROVIDED OUR MEMBERS WITH A HUNDRED AND TWENTY ADDITIONAL CERTIFICATION HOURS. DRAMATICALLY IMPROVING THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND ABILITY TO MANAGE THE RISE IN EXTREMELY COMPLEX CASES. OUR MEMBERS ARE APPOINTED BY THE COURT PERSONAL DECISION MAKING FOR OUR CLIENTS WHO'S RIGHT TO SELF DETERMINATION IS REMOVED BY THE COURT WHEN WERE APPOINTED. AS A RESULT OUR MEMBERS MUST BE TRAINED IN A WIDE RANGE OF TOPICS COVERING ALL ASPECTS OF LIFE INCLUDING DECISIONS. CONCERNING PSYCHIATRIC AND MEDICAL CARE PLACEMENT MEDICATION END OF LIFE TREATMENT ANYTHING THAT YOUR DISABLED GRANDMOTHER YOUR DISABLED BROTHER YOUR DISABLED CHILD MIGHT NEED WE GET APPOINTED AND WE TAKE CARE OF OUR MEMBERS ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING THE CLIENT'S PERSONAL INCOME.
