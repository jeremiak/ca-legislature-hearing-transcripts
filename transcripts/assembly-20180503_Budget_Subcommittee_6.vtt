I THINK IS AN EDUCATION RELATED

00:20:11.844 --> 00:20:14.814 region:rollup2
THING THAT WE TALKED ABOUT IT'S

00:20:13.879 --> 00:20:18.117 region:rollup2
UP TO TWO YEARS AGO.

00:20:14.814 --> 00:20:20.286 region:rollup2
WE FOUND OUT MONTHS LATER AND SO

00:20:18.117 --> 00:20:23.456 region:rollup2
WITH EITHER OF THOSE TWO. US

YOU I'M.

00:20:24.223 --> 00:20:27.359 region:rollup2
I I REALLY THINK THAT IT SHOULD

00:20:26.358 --> 00:20:28.694 region:rollup2
BE THE DEPARTMENT OF I MEAN

00:20:27.359 --> 00:20:30.529 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:20:28.694 --> 00:20:32.465 region:rollup2
FINANCE IS MAKING A THESE

00:20:30.529 --> 00:20:34.200 region:rollup2
DECISIONS WE HAVE TO DO. A LOT

00:20:32.465 --> 00:20:36.535 region:rollup2
OF RESEARCH TO FIND OUT.

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:38.604 region:rollup2
WHICH OF BILLS HAD BEEN VETOED

00:20:36.535 --> 00:20:40.439 region:rollup2
AND AND AS FAR AS COSTS IF IT'S

00:20:38.604 --> 00:20:42.274 region:rollup2
JUST THESE FOUR BILLS THE COST

00:20:40.439 --> 00:20:43.909 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE REALLY MINIMAL IT'S A.

00:20:42.274 --> 00:20:46.445 region:rollup2
SENDING AN EMAIL TO THE AUTHOR.

00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:48.180 region:rollup2

THERE ARE NOT MORE BILLS THAT

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:50.116 region:rollup2
ARE.

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:52.284 region:rollup2
VETO THIS WAY AND AGAIN I THINK

00:20:50.116 --> 00:20:54.553 region:rollup2
THIS IS JUST FUNDAMENTAL

00:20:52.284 --> 00:20:56.622 region:rollup2
SEPARATION OF POWER. THESE BILLS

00:20:54.553 --> 00:20:59.125 region:rollup2
WERE SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. AND

00:20:56.622 --> 00:21:05.931 region:rollup2
I HAD NO IDEA THAT TWO OF MY

00:20:59.125 --> 00:21:07.766 region:rollup2

00:21:05.931 --> 00:21:10.236 region:rollup2

00:21:14.707 --> 00:21:18.444 region:rollup2
HERE. BUT YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO

00:21:16.208 --> 00:21:20.546 region:rollup2
KEEP IN MIND THAT. THE BUDGET IS

00:21:18.444 --> 00:21:22.047 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY CREATED BY THE MEMBERS

00:21:20.546 --> 00:21:23.315 region:rollup2
NOT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE NOR

00:21:22.047 --> 00:21:25.484 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE.

00:21:23.315 --> 00:21:26.819 region:rollup2
AND SO IF THIS IS A PROBLEM IT

00:21:25.484 --> 00:21:27.887 region:rollup2
COULD ACTUALLY I MEAN WE COULD

00:21:26.819 --> 00:21:29.755 region:rollup2
TALK TO THE GOVERNOR AND

00:21:27.887 --> 00:21:31.457 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT FINANCE ABOUT SOLVING

00:21:29.755 --> 00:21:33.159 region:rollup2
THIS PROBLEM BUT IT REALLY IS

00:21:31.457 --> 00:21:33.793 region:rollup2
OUR PROBLEM. BECAUSE WE HAVE THE

00:21:33.159 --> 00:21:35.761 region:rollup2
CAPACITY TO PUT THESE THINGS IN

00:21:33.793 --> 00:21:36.862 region:rollup2
THE BUDGET.

00:21:35.761 --> 00:21:38.497 region:rollup2
WE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO CREATE THE

00:21:36.862 --> 00:21:40.132 region:rollup2
BUDGET AND I SOMETIMES GET

00:21:38.497 --> 00:21:41.700 region:rollup2
CONCERNED THAT WE. HAVE TO THROW

00:21:40.132 --> 00:21:42.968 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING A RELY HEAVILY UPON

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:46.138 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR TO GIVE US WHAT TO

00:21:42.968 --> 00:21:51.677 region:rollup2
DO HIS BUDGET IS THE SUGGESTION.

00:21:46.138 --> 00:21:52.845 region:rollup2
OURS IS ACTUALLY THE BUDGET.

00:21:51.677 --> 00:21:53.579 region:rollup2
I THINK I THINK I THINK YOU FOR

00:21:52.845 --> 00:21:54.647 region:rollup2
THAT REMINDER DOCTOR WEBER I

00:21:53.579 --> 00:21:57.049 region:rollup2
THINK.

00:21:54.647 --> 00:22:00.286 region:rollup2
IN THIS PARTICULAR EXAMPLE.

00:21:57.049 --> 00:22:01.520 region:rollup2
MISS IRWIN WAS CONCERNED LAST

00:22:00.286 --> 00:22:03.122 region:rollup2
YEAR BY THE EMISSIONS I THINK

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:06.992 region:rollup2
WE'RE TRYING TO.

00:22:03.122 --> 00:22:08.727 region:rollup2
IF HER STAFF HADN'T NOTICED DE

00:22:06.992 --> 00:22:10.262 region:rollup2
OMISSION THEN PERHAPS IT WOULD

00:22:08.727 --> 00:22:11.797 region:rollup2
HAVE GONE UNRECOGNIZED I THINK

00:22:10.262 --> 00:22:14.533 region:rollup2
WE WERE JUST TRYING TO. AYE

00:22:11.797 --> 00:22:16.635 region:rollup2
INSURER THAT WE DIDN'T ALL HAVE

00:22:14.533 --> 00:22:17.570 region:rollup2
TO COMB THROUGH EVERY LINE ITEM

00:22:16.635 --> 00:22:19.738 region:rollup2
IN THE BUDGET TO MAKE SURE THE

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:21.407 region:rollup2
BILLS THAT WERE SIGNED AND

00:22:19.738 --> 00:22:23.375 region:rollup2
COMMITTED TO. WERE ACTUALLY HOW

00:22:21.407 --> 00:22:26.212 region:rollup2
FUNDED SO THAT I THINK THAT WAS

00:22:23.375 --> 00:22:27.713 region:rollup2
THE ONLY THOUGHT THAT WAS IT GUY

00:22:26.212 --> 00:22:28.214 region:rollup2
ISSUE DISPELS TRY TO RECTIFY.

00:22:27.713 --> 00:22:28.480 region:rollup2

MILES OF STATE HIGHWAY.

00:25:02.334 --> 00:25:05.404 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY IN RECENT YEARS WE

HAVE GOTTEN AWAY FROM THAT RICH

00:25:05.404 --> 00:25:08.874 region:rollup2

THE STATE CONSTITUTION. THAT

00:25:26.291 --> 00:25:30.095 region:rollup2
WOULD REQUIRE THE ALLOCATION OF

MAINTENANCE AND REHABILITATION.

00:25:40.139 --> 00:25:42.975 region:rollup2

FORTIES AND NINETEEN FIFTIES.

00:25:55.421 --> 00:25:58.357 region:rollup2
THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT WOULD

00:25:56.622 --> 00:25:59.925 region:rollup2
DRIVE CALIFORNIA FORWARD INTO

00:25:58.357 --> 00:26:01.560 region:rollup2

A WATER DELIVERY SYSTEM

00:26:04.596 --> 00:26:07.766 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY THINGS LIKE A

00:26:06.432 --> 00:26:09.334 region:rollup2
ROADWAYS THAT AUTOMATICALLY

00:26:07.766 --> 00:26:10.736 region:rollup2
CHARGE ELECTRIC VEHICLES AS THEY

00:26:09.334 --> 00:26:12.237 region:rollup2
WERE DRIVING THESE ARE THE KINDS

00:26:10.736 --> 00:26:13.672 region:rollup2
OF INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THAT

00:26:12.237 --> 00:26:15.474 region:rollup2
WOULD MAKE CALIFORNIA A LEAD THE

00:26:13.672 --> 00:26:17.176 region:rollup2
NATION AGAIN. IN INFRASTRUCTURE

00:26:15.474 --> 00:26:17.776 region:rollup2

AS WE ARE NOW.

00:26:17.776 --> 00:26:21.513 region:rollup2
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT.

00:26:19.578 --> 00:26:23.382 region:rollup2

THESE ARE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE

00:26:34.359 --> 00:26:37.362 region:rollup2
BADLY NEEDED AND WE CAN DO IT IN

00:26:35.994 --> 00:26:38.831 region:rollup2
SUCH WAY THAT PAVES THE WAY FOR

00:26:37.362 --> 00:26:41.733 region:rollup2

00:27:33.719 --> 00:27:36.522 region:rollup2
IT'S DIFFICULT TO ENGAGE IN

00:27:34.286 --> 00:27:38.223 region:rollup2
LONG.

00:27:36.522 --> 00:27:39.758 region:rollup2
LONG RANGE PLANNING FOR CAPITAL

00:27:38.223 --> 00:27:41.126 region:rollup2

00:27:54.773 --> 00:27:57.843 region:rollup2
IMPACT ON THE GENERAL FUND

00:27:56.341 --> 00:28:00.479 region:rollup2
COMPARED TO PAY GO BECAUSE THAT.

00:27:57.843 --> 00:28:02.047 region:rollup2
THE INTEREST PAYMENTS ON IT SO.

00:28:00.479 --> 00:28:03.448 region:rollup2
WE THINK IT MAKES MORE SENSE FOR

00:28:02.047 --> 00:28:04.449 region:rollup2
THE STATE TO GET ON A STEADY

TRANSFORMATION OF TRANSPORTATION

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:31.510 region:rollup2
BEFORE OUR VERY EYES.

00:28:29.741 --> 00:28:33.312 region:rollup2
HOW CONSUMERS GET GET PRODUCTS

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:34.713 region:rollup2
FROM A POINT A TO POINT B. IS

00:28:33.312 --> 00:28:36.648 region:rollup2
CHANGING RAPIDLY BUT WE ARE

00:28:34.713 --> 00:28:38.517 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY STILL EXPERIENCING

00:28:36.648 --> 00:28:39.952 region:rollup2
SOME THE SAME OLD PROBLEMS THAT?

HOW BAD ARE TRAFFIC IS A

00:28:43.021 --> 00:28:46.525 region:rollup2
CONGESTION IS IN IN THE STATE OF

00:28:44.289 --> 00:28:47.993 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA? AT THE SAME TIME THE

00:28:46.525 --> 00:28:49.895 region:rollup2
AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY IS EVOLVING

00:28:47.993 --> 00:28:52.097 region:rollup2
FROM HARDWARE TO A SOFTWARE

00:28:49.895 --> 00:28:53.732 region:rollup2
BASED BUSINESS MODEL. THIS MEANS

00:28:52.097 --> 00:28:55.167 region:rollup2
THAT THE FUTURE OF MOBILITY AND

00:28:53.732 --> 00:28:56.768 region:rollup2
THE NEEDS AND DEMANDS WILL

00:28:55.167 --> 00:28:58.570 region:rollup2
INCREASINGLY BE ELECTRIFIED

00:28:56.768 --> 00:28:59.938 region:rollup2
AUTOMATED AND CONNECTED.

00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:01.473 region:rollup2
TODAY THERE'S OVER FORTY

00:28:59.938 --> 00:29:03.542 region:rollup2
ELECTRIC VEHICLES THAT ARE

00:29:01.473 --> 00:29:04.476 region:rollup2
OFFERED IN CALIFORNIA. AYE AND

00:29:03.542 --> 00:29:06.445 region:rollup2
AUTOMAKERS ARE ANNOUNCING

00:29:04.476 --> 00:29:07.713 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE PLANS TO

OFFER MORE ELECTRIC VEHICLES IN

00:29:07.713 --> 00:29:11.950 region:rollup2
THE COMING YEARS.

00:29:09.348 --> 00:29:14.987 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE HAS PROVEN TO BE

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:17.422 region:rollup2
A MAJOR IMPORTANT FACTOR.

00:29:14.987 --> 00:29:18.991 region:rollup2
IN HELPING CONSUMERS ADOPT AND

00:29:17.422 --> 00:29:20.792 region:rollup2
HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THIS NEW TYPE

00:29:18.991 --> 00:29:21.893 region:rollup2

00:29:20.792 --> 00:29:23.428 region:rollup2
WE WERE VERY PLEASED WITH THE

00:29:21.893 --> 00:29:25.464 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER.

00:29:23.428 --> 00:29:26.732 region:rollup2

MOVING FORWARD IT'S

00:29:37.776 --> 00:29:40.879 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION THAT.

00:29:39.244 --> 00:29:42.314 region:rollup2
WE NEED A NETWORK THAT WILL

00:29:40.879 --> 00:29:43.915 region:rollup2
SERVE HIGHLY AUTOMATED SLIGHTLY

00:29:42.314 --> 00:29:45.951 region:rollup2

00:29:52.524 --> 00:29:55.027 region:rollup2
BE THE FOUNDATION FOR IMPROVING

00:29:54.026 --> 00:29:56.628 region:rollup2
VEHICLE SAFETY AND TRAFFIC

00:29:55.027 --> 00:29:57.729 region:rollup2

IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE

00:29:57.729 --> 00:30:01.533 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION WILL BE VASTLY

00:29:59.765 --> 00:30:02.834 region:rollup2
SAFER CLEANER AND QUICKER. BUT

00:30:01.533 --> 00:30:03.935 region:rollup2
THAT FUTURE PRESENTS US WITH A

00:30:02.834 --> 00:30:05.470 region:rollup2
NEW SET OF INFRASTRUCTURE

HALF OF WHAT CALIFORNIA WOULD

00:40:21.786 --> 00:40:25.223 region:rollup2

WHETHER RECESSION. WE DOUBT THAT

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:05.663 region:rollup2
IT APPEARS TO CIRCUMVENT THE

00:41:03.728 --> 00:41:07.899 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS OF OUR

00:41:05.663 --> 00:41:09.334 region:rollup2

00:41:27.618 --> 00:41:31.889 region:rollup2
BIZARRE TO HAVE A RESERVE FUND

00:41:29.787 --> 00:41:34.492 region:rollup2
THAT IS CAPPED.

00:41:31.889 --> 00:41:35.827 region:rollup2
WHY NOT HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY

00:41:34.492 --> 00:41:38.696 region:rollup2
IN THE BUDGET PROCESS?

00:41:35.827 --> 00:41:41.833 region:rollup2
?

00:41:38.696 --> 00:41:43.735 region:rollup2
AND I THINK ARM.

00:41:41.833 --> 00:41:46.237 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S MY RESPONSE TO THAT IS

00:41:43.735 --> 00:41:48.106 region:rollup2
ARM.

00:41:46.237 --> 00:41:49.974 region:rollup2
THE CREATION THAT THAT THE MAYOR

00:41:48.106 --> 00:41:51.442 region:rollup2
CREATION OF AN ADDITIONAL

00:41:49.974 --> 00:41:53.878 region:rollup2
RESERVE ACCOUNT.

00:41:51.442 --> 00:41:56.247 region:rollup2
SHOULD NOT BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

00:41:53.878 --> 00:41:57.815 region:rollup2
AS LONG AS WE ARE FULFILLING

00:41:56.247 --> 00:41:59.784 region:rollup2
OUR CONSTITUTIONAL DUTIES TO

00:41:57.815 --> 00:42:01.219 region:rollup2
FILL THE SECOND RESERVE WHICH IS

00:41:59.784 --> 00:42:03.454 region:rollup2
THE RAINY DAY FUND THIS IS

00:42:01.219 --> 00:42:05.289 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY. THE REASON YOU NEED

00:42:03.454 --> 00:42:07.024 region:rollup2
A THIRD RESERVE ACCOUNT. IS.

00:42:05.289 --> 00:42:09.227 region:rollup2
THE EXACT.

00:42:07.024 --> 00:42:11.262 region:rollup2
FOR THAT REASON.

00:42:09.227 --> 00:42:13.431 region:rollup2
THE SECOND RESERVE ACCOUNT HAS

00:42:11.262 --> 00:42:15.366 region:rollup2
LIMIT HAS LIMITATIONS.

00:42:13.431 --> 00:42:16.801 region:rollup2
IT HAS LIMITATIONS WHY WOULD WE

00:42:15.366 --> 00:42:17.335 region:rollup2
WHY WOULD WE PUT OURSELVES IN A

00:42:16.801 --> 00:42:18.836 region:rollup2
POSITION OF HAVING A FALSE

00:42:17.335 --> 00:42:20.204 region:rollup2
CHOICE.

00:42:18.836 --> 00:42:22.573 region:rollup2
IF WE WANT TO PUT MORE MONEY IN

00:42:20.204 --> 00:42:23.741 region:rollup2
RESERVES WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO.

00:42:22.573 --> 00:42:24.842 region:rollup2

THE ECONOMY. SOME STATE PROGRAMS

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:35.586 region:rollup2
THE BIG ISSUE.

00:42:34.185 --> 00:42:37.722 region:rollup2
YEAH IT'S NOT A MATTER OF IF

00:42:35.586 --> 00:42:39.791 region:rollup2
IT'S A MATTER OF WHEN. IF WE CAN

00:42:37.722 --> 00:42:40.525 region:rollup2
LESSEN THAT IMPACT. I THINK IT'S

00:42:39.791 --> 00:42:42.326 region:rollup2

TO CONTINUE TO TRY AND WORK

00:44:21.726 --> 00:44:24.662 region:rollup2
TOGETHER TO FIGURE OUT IF WE CAN

00:44:23.127 --> 00:44:26.197 region:rollup2
GET TO THE MIDDLE.

00:44:24.662 --> 00:44:27.398 region:rollup2
MR CHAIRMAN I HAVE A FOLLOW UP

00:44:26.197 --> 00:44:28.1000 region:rollup2
COMMENT PLEASE OF THE I WOULD

00:44:27.398 --> 00:44:30.334 region:rollup2
JUST ADD TO THAT MISTER DALY'S

00:44:28.1000 --> 00:44:32.503 region:rollup2
COMES I THINK FOR THE PART OF

00:44:30.334 --> 00:44:33.738 region:rollup2
FINANCE TO. SUGGEST THAT WE CAN

00:44:32.503 --> 00:44:35.439 region:rollup2
ONLY INVEST MENTOR STRUCTURE

00:44:33.738 --> 00:44:37.375 region:rollup2
MORE WE FULLY FUND THE RAINY DAY

00:44:35.439 --> 00:44:38.843 region:rollup2
FUND THIS WOULD SOMEHOW DETRACT

00:44:37.375 --> 00:44:42.313 region:rollup2
FROM MAKING INFRASTRUCTURE. AYE

00:44:38.843 --> 00:44:43.281 region:rollup2
IS IS ABSOLUTELY ARE A RED

00:44:42.313 --> 00:44:45.249 region:rollup2
HERRING IN A FALSE CHOICE.

00:44:43.281 --> 00:44:47.218 region:rollup2
WE AS A BODY CAN MAKE THE

00:44:45.249 --> 00:44:47.919 region:rollup2
DECISIONS TO USE WHATEVER FUNDS

00:44:47.218 --> 00:44:50.288 region:rollup2
WE INTEND TO SPEND ON

00:44:47.919 --> 00:44:51.022 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE. THE FACT THAT WE

00:44:50.288 --> 00:44:52.924 region:rollup2
HAVE.

00:44:51.022 --> 00:44:55.326 region:rollup2
RESTRICTIONS ON OUR SAVINGS

00:44:52.924 --> 00:44:57.128 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTS THAT DON'T MEET EVEN

00:44:55.326 --> 00:44:58.963 region:rollup2
THE MILD RECESSION PROJECTIONS

00:44:57.128 --> 00:45:00.665 region:rollup2
OF THE ALEJO SUGGEST THAT

00:44:58.963 --> 00:45:01.999 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY POORLY DRAFTED.

00:45:00.665 --> 00:45:03.668 region:rollup2
SOME OF THOSE.

00:45:01.999 --> 00:45:05.603 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS EFFORTS AND WE NEED TO

00:45:03.668 --> 00:45:07.171 region:rollup2
MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS THIS

00:45:05.603 --> 00:45:09.106 region:rollup2
ALLOWS US THAT FLEXIBILITY.

00:45:07.171 --> 00:45:10.775 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL AN END RUN

00:45:09.106 --> 00:45:12.076 region:rollup2
AROUND I WOULD CALL AN

00:45:10.775 --> 00:45:15.146 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT TO?

00:45:12.076 --> 00:45:18.149 region:rollup2
I PROPOSE A PREVIOUS PROPOSAL.

00:45:15.146 --> 00:45:20.218 region:rollup2
I AGREE COMPLETELY.

00:45:18.149 --> 00:45:22.653 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S QUESTION TO BOTH.

00:45:20.218 --> 00:45:25.523 region:rollup2
MY COLLEAGUES AS WELL AS MISS

00:45:22.653 --> 00:45:27.191 region:rollup2
COSTA. ON AT DID YOU ALSO LOOK

00:45:25.523 --> 00:45:28.326 region:rollup2
AT POTENTIALLY JUST EXPANDING

00:45:27.191 --> 00:45:30.595 region:rollup2
THEIR OF THE REGULAR RESERVE

00:45:28.326 --> 00:45:32.330 region:rollup2
COUNT I KNOW THAT. ON THE RECORD

00:45:30.595 --> 00:45:34.065 region:rollup2
YOUR ACCOUNT HAS HAS SOME OF AN

00:45:32.330 --> 00:45:35.399 region:rollup2
ARTIFICIAL CAP THAT WHEN YOU HIT

00:45:34.065 --> 00:45:38.336 region:rollup2
THAT FOUR PERCENT THAT WE HAVE

00:45:35.399 --> 00:45:40.871 region:rollup2
TO GO LOWERED THE BAR. SALES TAX

00:45:38.336 --> 00:45:42.506 region:rollup2
ON DECIDING YOU IT WE HAVE A SET

00:45:40.871 --> 00:45:43.975 region:rollup2
OF NOT TO HIT THAT FOUR PERCENT.

00:45:42.506 --> 00:45:46.143 region:rollup2
BUT WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT DOWN.

00:45:43.975 --> 00:45:48.145 region:rollup2
MISS COSTA YOU WOULD FIND MORE

00:45:46.143 --> 00:45:49.714 region:rollup2
FAVORABLE OR MIGHT BE BACK TO MY

00:45:48.145 --> 00:45:50.615 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES AT THAT WOULD BE.

00:45:49.714 --> 00:45:52.316 region:rollup2
BUT IN THAT WOULD SO THAT WAS

00:45:50.615 --> 00:45:53.784 region:rollup2
SORT OF EASIER TO DO.

00:45:52.316 --> 00:45:55.152 region:rollup2
I'M GONNA ATTEMPT NOT TO GET TOO

00:45:53.784 --> 00:45:56.687 region:rollup2
TECHNICAL WE START TALKING ABOUT

00:45:55.152 --> 00:45:58.689 region:rollup2
RESERVES AND THE IRONY IS NOT

00:45:56.687 --> 00:45:59.290 region:rollup2
LOST ON ME THAT WE'RE TALKING

00:45:58.689 --> 00:46:01.225 region:rollup2
ABOUT CREATING A THIRD RESERVE

00:45:59.290 --> 00:46:02.426 region:rollup2
FUND.

00:46:01.225 --> 00:46:04.562 region:rollup2
SAID THE FIRST RESERVE FUND

00:46:02.426 --> 00:46:06.063 region:rollup2
PROPS MOST FLEXIBLE OF THE LA AS

00:46:04.562 --> 00:46:07.832 region:rollup2
RECENT REPORT LAYS OUT IS THE

00:46:06.063 --> 00:46:09.267 region:rollup2
ASSET FEWER THE STATE FUND FOR

00:46:07.832 --> 00:46:10.935 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY A LOT OF

00:46:09.267 --> 00:46:12.536 region:rollup2
PEOPLE CONSIDER THAT KIND OF THE

00:46:10.935 --> 00:46:13.604 region:rollup2
BALLOTS OF YOUR CHECKBOOK.

00:46:12.536 --> 00:46:15.106 region:rollup2
IT'S WHAT WE UTILIZE WHEN

00:46:13.604 --> 00:46:17.074 region:rollup2
THERE'S AN EMERGENCY AS THERE

00:46:15.106 --> 00:46:17.908 region:rollup2
WAS RECENTLY IN BOTH THAT YOU

00:46:17.074 --> 00:46:19.276 region:rollup2
KNOW THE NORTH PART OF THE STATE

00:46:17.908 --> 00:46:21.212 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS THE SOUTHERN PART OF

00:46:19.276 --> 00:46:23.581 region:rollup2
THE STATE WITH THE WILDFIRES.

00:46:21.212 --> 00:46:25.216 region:rollup2
BSA AS WAS ON TESTIFIED AND I

00:46:23.581 --> 00:46:26.817 region:rollup2
WERE PROPOSING I'M ACTUALLY

00:46:25.216 --> 00:46:28.285 region:rollup2
GOING BEYOND WHAT'S REQUIRED AND

00:46:26.817 --> 00:46:29.153 region:rollup2
DEPOSITED THE PSA IN THE

00:46:28.285 --> 00:46:31.522 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S.

00:46:29.153 --> 00:46:32.923 region:rollup2
PROPOSED BUDGET TO BRING IT UP

00:46:31.522 --> 00:46:34.358 region:rollup2
TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL TARGET OF

00:46:32.923 --> 00:46:35.926 region:rollup2
TEN PERCENT.

00:46:34.358 --> 00:46:36.761 region:rollup2
THATTEN PERCENT NUMBER IS A

00:46:35.926 --> 00:46:38.729 region:rollup2
ROLLING NUMBER THAT'S

00:46:36.761 --> 00:46:40.264 region:rollup2
RECALCULATED AT EVERY YEAR THAT

00:46:38.729 --> 00:46:41.365 region:rollup2
WE I'M I JUST THE BUDGET

00:46:40.264 --> 00:46:42.667 region:rollup2
REVENUES TO MAKE SURE WE'RE

00:46:41.365 --> 00:46:43.534 region:rollup2
HITTING THE TEN PERCENT BECAUSE

00:46:42.667 --> 00:46:45.536 region:rollup2
REVENUES OBVIOUSLY ARE NOT

00:46:43.534 --> 00:46:47.672 region:rollup2
STATIC.

00:46:45.536 --> 00:46:48.873 region:rollup2
THAT SAID I THINK THE TWO

00:46:47.672 --> 00:46:50.441 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS THAT.

00:46:48.873 --> 00:46:52.243 region:rollup2
SEEM TO BE COMING BEFORE THE

00:46:50.441 --> 00:46:53.711 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE ARE TWO FOLD IF THERE

00:46:52.243 --> 00:46:55.880 region:rollup2
IS A RECESSION.

00:46:53.711 --> 00:46:57.748 region:rollup2
WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE DOLLAR

00:46:55.880 --> 00:47:00.151 region:rollup2
AMOUNT TO HAVE ON HAND?

00:46:57.748 --> 00:47:01.652 region:rollup2
AS HAS BEEN TESTIFIED ON ELLIOT

00:47:00.151 --> 00:47:04.355 region:rollup2
HAS SEVERAL DIFFERENT RECESSION

00:47:01.652 --> 00:47:06.023 region:rollup2
SCENARIOS WE DO AS WELL.

00:47:04.355 --> 00:47:08.225 region:rollup2
I WOULD NOTE THAT IN A RECESSION

00:47:06.023 --> 00:47:09.827 region:rollup2
SCENARIO IS LIKELY GOING TO

00:47:08.225 --> 00:47:12.563 region:rollup2
HAPPEN OVER MULTIPLE BUDGET

00:47:09.827 --> 00:47:14.732 region:rollup2
CYCLES SO EVEN IF YOU WERE TO

00:47:12.563 --> 00:47:16.200 region:rollup2
BUILD UP A HEALTHY RESERVE OF

00:47:14.732 --> 00:47:18.069 region:rollup2
FORTY BILLION DOLLARS. IT BUYS

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:19.537 region:rollup2
YOU TIME.

00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:20.805 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT A

00:47:19.537 --> 00:47:22.306 region:rollup2
RECESSION OF THAT SCALE AND

00:47:20.805 --> 00:47:24.241 region:rollup2
SCOPE WOULD CONTINUE INTO THE

00:47:22.306 --> 00:47:25.476 region:rollup2
NEXT BUDGET YEAR ON AND THAT WAS

00:47:24.241 --> 00:47:27.111 region:rollup2
REALLY ONE OF THE UNDERPINNINGS

00:47:25.476 --> 00:47:28.713 region:rollup2
OF PROPOSITION TWO. WAS TO

00:47:27.111 --> 00:47:30.414 region:rollup2
PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME A

00:47:28.713 --> 00:47:32.249 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT OF AN ABILITY TO FUND

00:47:30.414 --> 00:47:33.484 region:rollup2
THINGS. ON WHAT THE STRUCTURAL

00:47:32.249 --> 00:47:35.086 region:rollup2
ISSUES WERE DEALT WITH

00:47:33.484 --> 00:47:35.986 region:rollup2
PREVIOUSLY WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT

00:47:35.086 --> 00:47:37.254 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY.

00:47:35.986 --> 00:47:38.622 region:rollup2
ON TO YOUR POINT.

00:47:37.254 --> 00:47:40.725 region:rollup2
THERE ARE TWO.

00:47:38.622 --> 00:47:42.226 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT CODE SECTIONS THAT

00:47:40.725 --> 00:47:43.627 region:rollup2
LIMIT THE TOTAL AMOUNT IN THAT

00:47:42.226 --> 00:47:45.129 region:rollup2
AS AT THE YEAR BEFORE YOU

00:47:43.627 --> 00:47:47.365 region:rollup2
TRIGGER A SALES TAX.

00:47:45.129 --> 00:47:48.599 region:rollup2
OUGHT REDUCTION A ONE OF THOSE

00:47:47.365 --> 00:47:50.668 region:rollup2
CALCULATIONS I IS AT THE

00:47:48.599 --> 00:47:52.236 region:rollup2
DISCRETION OF THAT A DIRECTOR OF

00:47:50.668 --> 00:47:53.738 region:rollup2
FINANCE SO IN ESSENCE.

00:47:52.236 --> 00:47:55.773 region:rollup2
BOTH OF THE EXISTING RESERVES DO

00:47:53.738 --> 00:47:59.777 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE.

00:47:55.773 --> 00:48:01.879 region:rollup2
CAP OF SOME SORT.

00:47:59.777 --> 00:48:03.214 region:rollup2
THANK YOU. MISTER.

00:48:01.879 --> 00:48:05.249 region:rollup2
I THINK THE LA OWES DONE

00:48:03.214 --> 00:48:05.850 region:rollup2
EXCELLENT WORK ON THIS SUBJECT

00:48:05.249 --> 00:48:09.253 region:rollup2
AND.

00:48:05.850 --> 00:48:11.355 region:rollup2
THIS IDEA WE.

00:48:09.253 --> 00:48:12.690 region:rollup2
WHEN WE WHEN IT DAWNED ON US

00:48:11.355 --> 00:48:14.392 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ARE CAPS ON THE

00:48:12.690 --> 00:48:15.960 region:rollup2
EXISTING RESERVE ACCOUNTS.

00:48:14.392 --> 00:48:18.429 region:rollup2
WE STARTED TO TALK ABOUT THE

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:20.798 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL MEANWHILE THE LA.

00:48:18.429 --> 00:48:22.233 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENTLY REACHED A SIMILAR

00:48:20.798 --> 00:48:23.968 region:rollup2
CONCLUSION SO I THERE'S SOME

00:48:22.233 --> 00:48:25.870 region:rollup2
DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN FINANCE IN

00:48:23.968 --> 00:48:28.072 region:rollup2
THE LA SHOW. IN THIS SUBJECT

00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:30.408 region:rollup2
BEARS MORE DISCUSSION

00:48:28.072 --> 00:48:31.041 region:rollup2
MY LOVE GOAL AND I THINK MY

00:48:30.408 --> 00:48:32.076 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUE SHOULD WE JUST WANT TO

00:48:31.041 --> 00:48:34.512 region:rollup2
HAVE.

00:48:32.076 --> 00:48:36.046 region:rollup2
BOB ALL THE CHOICES ON THE TABLE

00:48:34.512 --> 00:48:38.015 region:rollup2
WE DON'T WANT FALSE CHOICES.

00:48:36.046 --> 00:48:39.650 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

00:48:38.015 --> 00:48:41.886 region:rollup2
I DON'T WANT.

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:44.221 region:rollup2
YEAH I APPRECIATE THAT THE

00:48:41.886 --> 00:48:45.790 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION AND OBVIOUSLY WE

00:48:44.221 --> 00:48:47.625 region:rollup2
NEED MUCH MORE DISCUSSION ABOUT.

00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:49.160 region:rollup2
OF VARIOUS RESERVE ACCOUNTS AND

00:48:47.625 --> 00:48:50.761 region:rollup2
WHETHER AND HOW HOW MUCH DO WE

00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:52.029 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY NEED AND. A BECAUSE I

00:48:50.761 --> 00:48:53.464 region:rollup2
CAN SEE US GETTING THIS WITH AND

00:48:52.029 --> 00:48:54.098 region:rollup2
THEN SOMEBODY COME ALONG AND SAY

00:48:53.464 --> 00:48:54.432 region:rollup2
WE NEED ANOTHER ONE AND WE NEED

00:48:54.098 --> 00:48:56.066 region:rollup2
ANOTHER ONE.

00:48:54.432 --> 00:48:57.768 region:rollup2
ANOTHER ONE

00:48:56.066 --> 00:48:58.702 region:rollup2
AND WHAT GENERALLY HAPPENS IN

00:48:57.768 --> 00:49:00.638 region:rollup2
THE MIDST OF ALL OF THE ACT.

00:48:58.702 --> 00:49:02.339 region:rollup2
IN THAT CONVERSATION WE FAIL TO

00:49:00.638 --> 00:49:04.608 region:rollup2
ALSO LOOK AT THE FACT THAT.

00:49:02.339 --> 00:49:05.876 region:rollup2
IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THIS AS

00:49:04.608 --> 00:49:07.778 region:rollup2
YOU POINTED OUT WE STILL HAVE

00:49:05.876 --> 00:49:09.346 region:rollup2
NOT FUNDED A AWFUL LOT OF THINGS

00:49:07.778 --> 00:49:10.848 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO FIND.

00:49:09.346 --> 00:49:12.583 region:rollup2
AND SO WE WE KEEP SAVING AND

00:49:10.848 --> 00:49:14.018 region:rollup2
SAVING AND SAVING AND WE NEVER

00:49:12.583 --> 00:49:15.853 region:rollup2
TAKE DEAL WITH THE FOLKS WHO

00:49:14.018 --> 00:49:17.488 region:rollup2
STRUGGLING A LITTLE SECURITY

00:49:15.853 --> 00:49:18.589 region:rollup2
WILL GET WHO CAN'T LIVE EVERY.

00:49:17.488 --> 00:49:20.124 region:rollup2
DAY BECAUSE I GETTING SEVEN

00:49:18.589 --> 00:49:21.826 region:rollup2
HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH IN RENT

00:49:20.124 --> 00:49:23.661 region:rollup2
IS HIDE THEY CAN'T YOU KNOW WE

00:49:21.826 --> 00:49:25.463 region:rollup2
GOT HEALTHCARE ISSUE SO WE GOT A

00:49:23.661 --> 00:49:26.463 region:rollup2
LOT OF ISSUES. WERE BEING ASKED

00:49:25.463 --> 00:49:28.265 region:rollup2
TO DELIVER INFRASTRUCTURE AND

00:49:26.463 --> 00:49:29.967 region:rollup2
UPDATED THAT SOUNDS REALLY

00:49:28.265 --> 00:49:31.335 region:rollup2
EXCITING BUT IF WE KEEP. A

00:49:29.967 --> 00:49:32.603 region:rollup2
SAVING AND SAVING INSIDE THE AND

00:49:31.335 --> 00:49:33.637 region:rollup2
I'M NOT OPPOSE THE SAME BUT

00:49:32.603 --> 00:49:35.539 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES I HAVE FRIENDS WHO SAY

00:49:33.637 --> 00:49:36.607 region:rollup2
EVEN THOUGH LEAH. AND ALL AND

00:49:35.539 --> 00:49:38.309 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE HUGE SAVINGS ACCOUNT

00:49:36.607 --> 00:49:40.344 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY DIED OH FOR SOMEBODY

00:49:38.309 --> 00:49:41.312 region:rollup2
ELSE TO ENJOY SO I THINK AT SOME

00:49:40.344 --> 00:49:43.714 region:rollup2
POINT WE HAVE TO FIND WHAT IS

00:49:41.312 --> 00:49:45.683 region:rollup2
REASONABLE AS A AS A AS A HOUSE

00:49:43.714 --> 00:49:47.451 region:rollup2
TO. IN TERMS OF A SAVINGS MOST

00:49:45.683 --> 00:49:49.320 region:rollup2
FOLKS LOOK AT TEN TWENTY TEN

00:49:47.451 --> 00:49:51.021 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN PERCENT OF WHATEVER BUT

00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:52.456 region:rollup2
I DON'T WANT US TO GET SO CAUGHT

00:49:51.021 --> 00:49:54.024 region:rollup2
UP IN THIS ALL THE TIME IT AND

00:49:52.456 --> 00:49:55.159 region:rollup2
ALL CONVERSATIONS. THAT WE'D

00:49:54.024 --> 00:49:58.128 region:rollup2
LOSE SIGHT OF THE FACT THAT

00:49:55.159 --> 00:49:59.363 region:rollup2
THERE'S STILL AN AWFUL LOT OF

00:49:58.128 --> 00:49:59.997 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT ARE NOT FUNDED.

00:49:59.363 --> 00:50:00.564 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE'RE EMBARRASSED THAT

00:49:59.997 --> 00:50:00.998 region:rollup2
OUR SCHOOLS AT FORTY SOME

00:50:00.564 --> 00:50:03.133 region:rollup2
PERCENT. YOU KNOW.

00:50:00.998 --> 00:50:04.835 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA WE DON'T FUND OUR

00:50:03.133 --> 00:50:07.171 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITIES ARE SEE ISSUES I

00:50:04.835 --> 00:50:07.805 region:rollup2
UC'S OF YOU KNOW WE DON'T FIND

00:50:07.171 --> 00:50:09.406 region:rollup2
THEM AT THE LEVEL THAT WE THINK

00:50:07.805 --> 00:50:10.741 region:rollup2
THEY SHOULD BE FUNDED. AND SO

00:50:09.406 --> 00:50:11.909 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT INVESTING IN MOST

00:50:10.741 --> 00:50:13.177 region:rollup2
THINGS AND WHAT INVESTING HONEST

00:50:11.909 --> 00:50:14.879 region:rollup2
IT WE WANTED IN THIS

00:50:13.177 --> 00:50:16.881 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION IS COST INVEST IN

00:50:14.879 --> 00:50:19.016 region:rollup2
SAVINGS WERE. IF WE INVESTED IN

00:50:16.881 --> 00:50:20.384 region:rollup2
PEOPLE OF THE REVENUE WOULD COME

00:50:19.016 --> 00:50:21.919 region:rollup2
AND THEREFORE YOU'D END UP WITH

00:50:20.384 --> 00:50:23.621 region:rollup2
THE MUCH MORE A DIFFERENT KIND

00:50:21.919 --> 00:50:24.788 region:rollup2
OF ROBUST CONVERSATION WE ALSO

00:50:23.621 --> 00:50:26.290 region:rollup2
HAVE NEVER DEALT WITH THE ISSUE

00:50:24.788 --> 00:50:27.825 region:rollup2
OF TAXES IN THE STATE AND WHAT

00:50:26.290 --> 00:50:29.627 region:rollup2
PROP THIRTEEN DID TO US. AND

00:50:27.825 --> 00:50:30.794 region:rollup2
CREATED THIS INSTABILITY NOBODY

00:50:29.627 --> 00:50:31.996 region:rollup2
WANTS TO DEAL WITH THAT SO WE

00:50:30.794 --> 00:50:33.197 region:rollup2
THINK WE CAN SAVE OUR WAY OUT OF

00:50:31.996 --> 00:50:34.732 region:rollup2
IT WITHOUT ACTUALLY LOOKING AT

00:50:33.197 --> 00:50:36.667 region:rollup2
WHAT IS HAPPENING IN TERMS OF

00:50:34.732 --> 00:50:38.102 region:rollup2
OUR TAX BASE. SO I MEAN THERE A

00:50:36.667 --> 00:50:39.637 region:rollup2
LOT OF HARD ISSUES THAT OTHER

00:50:38.102 --> 00:50:41.338 region:rollup2
STATES HAVE HAD TO DEAL WITH THE

00:50:39.637 --> 00:50:43.274 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH. SAVINGS.

00:50:41.338 --> 00:50:44.642 region:rollup2
IS FINE BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO

00:50:43.274 --> 00:50:46.277 region:rollup2
GET US TO WHERE WE WANT TO GO

00:50:44.642 --> 00:50:47.111 region:rollup2
AND THEN IT WAS SAVING THINKING

00:50:46.277 --> 00:50:48.512 region:rollup2
THIS GOING TO BE RECESSION IS

00:50:47.111 --> 00:50:50.047 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE RECESSION IN. AND

00:50:48.512 --> 00:50:51.248 region:rollup2
OUT AND THAT'S IMPORTANT WE HAVE

00:50:50.047 --> 00:50:52.449 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WILL WISE ABOUT

00:50:51.248 --> 00:50:54.952 region:rollup2
THAT BUT I DON'T.

00:50:52.449 --> 00:50:55.986 region:rollup2
I I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO THE

00:50:54.952 --> 00:50:57.655 region:rollup2
CONSULATE AND THE SAVINGS

00:50:55.986 --> 00:50:59.990 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTS WHEN I KNOW THAT THERE

00:50:57.655 --> 00:51:01.592 region:rollup2
ARE SO MANY ISSUES ON ALL OF OUR

00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:02.960 region:rollup2
BUDGETS THAT WE HAVE NOT FUNDED.

00:51:01.592 --> 00:51:04.795 region:rollup2
AND AND HAVE DON'T HAVE A PLAN

00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:06.463 region:rollup2
TO EVEN THINK ABOUT FUNDING AND

00:51:04.795 --> 00:51:07.932 region:rollup2
A AND SO WE HEAR ABOUT THAT THE

00:51:06.463 --> 00:51:10.701 region:rollup2
POVERTY RATE THE CHILD CARE THE

00:51:07.932 --> 00:51:11.669 region:rollup2
PRESCHOOLS. FOR ALL THE HEALTH

00:51:10.701 --> 00:51:13.270 region:rollup2
CARE FOR EVERYBODY YOU KNOW

00:51:11.669 --> 00:51:15.005 region:rollup2
WE'VE OF THOSE THINGS ARE OUT

00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:16.740 region:rollup2
THERE AND UP. AND UP AND.

00:51:15.005 --> 00:51:19.143 region:rollup2
THIS I DON'T KNOW IF THIS HELPS

00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:19.944 region:rollup2
US I DON'T THINK IT DOES BUT A I

00:51:19.143 --> 00:51:20.978 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO

00:51:19.944 --> 00:51:22.713 region:rollup2
HAVE A CONVERSATION WHAT IS

00:51:20.978 --> 00:51:23.914 region:rollup2
REASONABLE TO DEAL WITH SAVINGS.

00:51:22.713 --> 00:51:25.549 region:rollup2
BUT I GET SO CAUGHT UP IN IT

00:51:23.914 --> 00:51:27.184 region:rollup2
THAT WE IN THE SAVING OUR WAY IN

00:51:25.549 --> 00:51:31.255 region:rollup2
SUCH A MANNER THAT WE FAIL TO

00:51:27.184 --> 00:51:33.223 region:rollup2
RESPOND TO THE ISSUES WE HAVE TO

00:51:31.255 --> 00:51:34.725 region:rollup2
FILL DEAL WITH EVERYDAY.

00:51:33.223 --> 00:51:35.926 region:rollup2
THE CONDUCTOR OF THE SCRIPT IN

00:51:34.725 --> 00:51:36.193 region:rollup2
SHERMAN I IF I COULD JUST

00:51:35.926 --> 00:51:37.261 region:rollup2
RESPOND.

00:51:36.193 --> 00:51:38.629 region:rollup2
TWO DUTCH WORDS COMMENTS AND

00:51:37.261 --> 00:51:40.798 region:rollup2
FRANKLY I AGREE WITH MUCH OF

00:51:38.629 --> 00:51:43.067 region:rollup2
WHAT. SHE HAD TO SAY THEIR.

00:51:40.798 --> 00:51:45.602 region:rollup2
MOST NOTABLY A TOWARDS THE END

00:51:43.067 --> 00:51:46.804 region:rollup2
OF HER A QUESTION THIS

00:51:45.602 --> 00:51:48.272 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION OF TAX REFORM.

00:51:46.804 --> 00:51:49.206 region:rollup2
RIGHT BECAUSE AT THE CORE OF

00:51:48.272 --> 00:51:51.542 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS

00:51:49.206 --> 00:51:53.177 region:rollup2
THIS STATE HAS NOT DONE ANY

00:51:51.542 --> 00:51:55.346 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT TAX REFORM. A IN A

00:51:53.177 --> 00:51:57.314 region:rollup2
VERY LONG TIME WE CONTINUE TO

00:51:55.346 --> 00:51:59.316 region:rollup2
HAVE BOOM AND BUST BUDGETS

00:51:57.314 --> 00:52:01.418 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE A STABLE

00:51:59.316 --> 00:52:04.521 region:rollup2
REVENUE SOURCE OVER MULTIPLE

00:52:01.418 --> 00:52:04.722 region:rollup2
BUDGET YEARS. AND I AND I WOULD

00:52:04.521 --> 00:52:07.925 region:rollup2
JOIN.

00:52:04.722 --> 00:52:09.226 region:rollup2
MISS WEBER IN AND SUGGESTING WE

00:52:07.925 --> 00:52:11.095 region:rollup2
SHOULD ENGAGE IN THAT BEHAVIOR

00:52:09.226 --> 00:52:12.730 region:rollup2
UP UNTIL THAT TIME IN WHICH WE

00:52:11.095 --> 00:52:13.197 region:rollup2
GET SOME TAX REFORM FOR MORE

00:52:12.730 --> 00:52:15.432 region:rollup2
STABLE REVENUES IT IS

00:52:13.197 --> 00:52:17.568 region:rollup2
IRRATIONAL.

00:52:15.432 --> 00:52:19.303 region:rollup2
IMMATURE AND IRRESPONSIBLE NOT

00:52:17.568 --> 00:52:22.306 region:rollup2
TO HAVE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS

00:52:19.303 --> 00:52:23.807 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY BECAUSE WE CAN A.

00:52:22.306 --> 00:52:25.776 region:rollup2
BAD FOR INCREASED THOSE VERY

00:52:23.807 --> 00:52:27.911 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT MISS WEBER JUST

00:52:25.776 --> 00:52:29.279 region:rollup2
OUTLINED JUST TO CUT THEM TO A

00:52:27.911 --> 00:52:31.382 region:rollup2
THREE YEARS DOWN THE LINE.

00:52:29.279 --> 00:52:33.717 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT GOOD PRACTICE IT'S

00:52:31.382 --> 00:52:35.219 region:rollup2
NOT GOOD PUBLIC POLICY AND SO I

00:52:33.717 --> 00:52:36.520 region:rollup2
WOULD GUESS I WOULD LOOK AT THE

00:52:35.219 --> 00:52:38.689 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU MEMBERS AS.

00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:40.424 region:rollup2
A MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY FOR THIS

00:52:38.689 --> 00:52:42.426 region:rollup2
BODY FOR THE LEGISLATURE UP

00:52:40.424 --> 00:52:44.061 region:rollup2
UNTIL THE POINT ON THAT WE CAN

00:52:42.426 --> 00:52:46.030 region:rollup2
ACHIEVE SOME KIND OF TAX REFORM

00:52:44.061 --> 00:52:47.431 region:rollup2
TO CREATE A MORE STABLE. A

00:52:46.030 --> 00:52:49.767 region:rollup2
REVENUE SOURCE SOURCE OVER ABOUT

00:52:47.431 --> 00:52:52.403 region:rollup2
YEARS.

00:52:49.767 --> 00:52:54.538 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE.

00:52:52.403 --> 00:52:56.673 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO I AM

00:52:54.538 --> 00:52:58.475 region:rollup2
GENERALLY VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE

00:52:56.673 --> 00:53:00.244 region:rollup2
IDEA THAT WE SHOULD BE SETTING

00:52:58.475 --> 00:53:02.212 region:rollup2
ASIDE MORE OF OUR MONEY. WHEN

00:53:00.244 --> 00:53:03.213 region:rollup2
TIMES ARE ECONOMICALLY GOOD

00:53:02.212 --> 00:53:04.648 region:rollup2
RELATIVELY SPEAKING AND THAT

00:53:03.213 --> 00:53:07.284 region:rollup2
WILL ALLOW US.

00:53:04.648 --> 00:53:08.819 region:rollup2
TO SPEND MORE WHEN TIMES ARE

00:53:07.284 --> 00:53:10.654 region:rollup2
ECONOMICALLY BAD AND HELP OUT

00:53:08.819 --> 00:53:12.623 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE THAT I HAVE GREATER

00:53:10.654 --> 00:53:14.858 region:rollup2
DEMAND FOR SOCIAL SERVICES WHEN.

00:53:12.623 --> 00:53:16.593 region:rollup2
WHEN ARE WE GET WE SLIP INTO

00:53:14.858 --> 00:53:18.195 region:rollup2
RECESSION SO VERY SUPPORTIVE OF

00:53:16.593 --> 00:53:20.898 region:rollup2
THAT HOWEVER I DON'T THINK IT'S

00:53:18.195 --> 00:53:22.166 region:rollup2
ACCURATE TO SAY THAT THE SFU.

00:53:20.898 --> 00:53:23.767 region:rollup2
HAS A CAP HAVE BEEN IT'S CLEAR

00:53:22.166 --> 00:53:25.536 region:rollup2
THAT THE BSA HAS A CAP THE SFE

00:53:23.767 --> 00:53:27.371 region:rollup2
YOU JUST HAS A LIMIT BEYOND

00:53:25.536 --> 00:53:28.972 region:rollup2
WHICH WERE WE TO CONTINUE TO

00:53:27.371 --> 00:53:30.607 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTE MONEY TO IT. WE WOULD

00:53:28.972 --> 00:53:32.543 region:rollup2
BE OBLIGATED TO LOWER THE STATE

00:53:30.607 --> 00:53:35.245 region:rollup2
SALES TAX RATE SO I THINK THAT

00:53:32.543 --> 00:53:36.780 region:rollup2
ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT CREATING

00:53:35.245 --> 00:53:38.115 region:rollup2
THE THIRD RESERVE ACCOUNT.

00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:39.850 region:rollup2
PASSED TO INCLUDE A DISCUSSION

00:53:38.115 --> 00:53:41.718 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT IT IS

00:53:39.850 --> 00:53:43.587 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE TO JUST CONTINUE

00:53:41.718 --> 00:53:45.255 region:rollup2
FUNDING THE SFE YOU. ARE AND

00:53:43.587 --> 00:53:46.924 region:rollup2
ACCEPT THE FACT THAT BECAUSE WE

00:53:45.255 --> 00:53:48.859 region:rollup2
HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL BUDGET

00:53:46.924 --> 00:53:50.127 region:rollup2
SURPLUS SO IT'S APPROPRIATE TO

00:53:48.859 --> 00:53:52.863 region:rollup2
LOWER THE SALES TAX RATE

00:53:50.127 --> 00:53:54.198 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

00:53:52.863 --> 00:53:56.166 region:rollup2
THANK.

00:53:54.198 --> 00:53:58.368 region:rollup2
MISS MCCARTY.

00:53:56.166 --> 00:54:01.238 region:rollup2
YEAH I WANTED TO GO BACK TO THE.

00:53:58.368 --> 00:54:02.740 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S FLEXIBILITY OR ITS.

00:54:01.238 --> 00:54:04.575 region:rollup2
IT'S INSUFFICIENT THE NUMBER I

00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:06.376 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT THAT MISTER DALY UNITE

00:54:04.575 --> 00:54:07.544 region:rollup2
TALK LAST FEARS ABOUT A RESERVE

00:54:06.376 --> 00:54:08.879 region:rollup2
IN ONE THE FIRST QUESTIONS YOU

00:54:07.544 --> 00:54:10.280 region:rollup2
ASKED WE DO A PRESENTATION IN

00:54:08.879 --> 00:54:12.082 region:rollup2
OUR CAUCUSES.

00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:13.951 region:rollup2
WHERE WE AT WITH CLOSE TO THAT

00:54:12.082 --> 00:54:15.753 region:rollup2
THAT TEN PERCENT MARKER? AND

00:54:13.951 --> 00:54:17.688 region:rollup2
DOWN AND I THINK THE QUESTION IS

00:54:15.753 --> 00:54:19.289 region:rollup2
IS THERE AND NOT FLEXIBILITY NOT

00:54:17.688 --> 00:54:21.758 region:rollup2
BUT IS THAT INSUFFICIENT AND I

00:54:19.289 --> 00:54:22.259 region:rollup2
THINK YOUR ARGUMENT THAT YOU'RE

00:54:21.758 --> 00:54:24.928 region:rollup2
MAKING IS THE TO RESERVE

00:54:22.259 --> 00:54:25.329 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTS. COMBINED ARE

00:54:24.928 --> 00:54:27.831 region:rollup2
INSUFFICIENT AND.

00:54:25.329 --> 00:54:29.500 region:rollup2
AND I DO KNOW THAT THE THE BILL

00:54:27.831 --> 00:54:31.034 region:rollup2
WE HEARD BEFORE HERE IS

00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:32.870 region:rollup2
INVESTING MORE IN INFRASTRUCTURE

00:54:31.034 --> 00:54:34.004 region:rollup2
AND ALL THE LETTERS WE GET.

00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:35.472 region:rollup2
YOU ARE SUBCOMMITTEE ABOUT

00:54:34.004 --> 00:54:36.907 region:rollup2
MAKING THESE INVESTMENTS THERE

00:54:35.472 --> 00:54:39.243 region:rollup2
ARE TRADE OFFS AND SO BUT MY

00:54:36.907 --> 00:54:39.877 region:rollup2
MIND A RESERVE LESS MONEY FOR

00:54:39.243 --> 00:54:40.878 region:rollup2
ALL THE ISSUES THAT WE WANTED TO

00:54:39.877 --> 00:54:42.546 region:rollup2
FOCUS.

00:54:40.878 --> 00:54:44.515 region:rollup2
IS IS IS THAT IS THAT AS THE

00:54:42.546 --> 00:54:46.617 region:rollup2
OVER ARCHING PREMISE FLEXIBILITY

00:54:44.515 --> 00:54:48.819 region:rollup2
OR THAT. WE THINK THAT TEN

00:54:46.617 --> 00:54:49.620 region:rollup2
PERCENT IS INADEQUATE IT I WOULD

00:54:48.819 --> 00:54:51.155 region:rollup2
SAY IT'S BOTH.

00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:53.590 region:rollup2
.

00:54:51.155 --> 00:54:55.793 region:rollup2
I THINK.

00:54:53.590 --> 00:54:58.095 region:rollup2
CURRENT STRUCTURE.

00:54:55.793 --> 00:54:59.563 region:rollup2
I MEAN I LIKE THE RAINY DAY FUND

00:54:58.095 --> 00:55:00.631 region:rollup2
IT'S REAL POPULAR AROUND THE

00:54:59.563 --> 00:55:02.332 region:rollup2
STATE I THINK IT WAS A GREAT

00:55:00.631 --> 00:55:02.1000 region:rollup2
IDEA.

00:55:02.332 --> 00:55:04.768 region:rollup2
IRONICALLY.

00:55:02.1000 --> 00:55:06.770 region:rollup2
IT'S.

00:55:04.768 --> 00:55:09.173 region:rollup2
IT IS LIMITED.

00:55:06.770 --> 00:55:10.607 region:rollup2
SO THAT WHEN IT'S MAXED OUT.

00:55:09.173 --> 00:55:12.075 region:rollup2
YOU SPEND THE OVERAGE ON

00:55:10.607 --> 00:55:13.710 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE MEANWHILE IN

00:55:12.075 --> 00:55:15.612 region:rollup2
OTHER PARTS OF THE BUDGET WE

00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:17.581 region:rollup2
SPEND MONEY ON INFRASTRUCTURE I

00:55:15.612 --> 00:55:19.416 region:rollup2
ALSO LIKE INFRASTRUCTURE. AND I

00:55:17.581 --> 00:55:21.251 region:rollup2
LIKE TOFUND THE PROGRAMS THE

00:55:19.416 --> 00:55:23.020 region:rollup2
MISS WEBER MENTIONED IT JUST IT

00:55:21.251 --> 00:55:24.688 region:rollup2
CREATES A FALSE CHOICE FOR US IN

00:55:23.020 --> 00:55:26.323 region:rollup2
THE BUDGET PROCESS IN A YEAR

00:55:24.688 --> 00:55:28.325 region:rollup2
LIKE THIS WHEN WE HAVE.

00:55:26.323 --> 00:55:29.860 region:rollup2
SURPLUS REVENUES.

00:55:28.325 --> 00:55:32.062 region:rollup2
WHY SHOULD WE BE ABLE TO SPEND

00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:34.331 region:rollup2
THE SURPLUS?

00:55:32.062 --> 00:55:35.999 region:rollup2
AS WE WOULD LIKE WERE AS WE

00:55:34.331 --> 00:55:38.235 region:rollup2
WOULD SUGGEST.

00:55:35.999 --> 00:55:40.037 region:rollup2
WITHOUT A.

00:55:38.235 --> 00:55:41.004 region:rollup2
WHAT IS A FALSE CHOICE IN THE

00:55:40.037 --> 00:55:42.406 region:rollup2
STRUCTURAL IN THE STRUCTURE THAT

00:55:41.004 --> 00:55:43.507 region:rollup2
WE HAVE

00:55:42.406 --> 00:55:44.942 region:rollup2
BUT IT BUT IT DOES GET TO THE

00:55:43.507 --> 00:55:46.643 region:rollup2
ISSUE THAT?

00:55:44.942 --> 00:55:47.945 region:rollup2
SOME WOULD SAY THAT IF WE HAVE

00:55:46.643 --> 00:55:49.680 region:rollup2
INCREASE REVENUE. THAT MAYBE WE

00:55:47.945 --> 00:55:52.115 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T.

00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:53.750 region:rollup2
A HIGHER MORE FACULTY AT SURE

00:55:52.115 --> 00:55:56.153 region:rollup2
HER CITY OR CSU YOU SHOULD DO

00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:57.621 region:rollup2
THINGS BY AT ONE TIME WHICH GOES

00:55:56.153 --> 00:56:00.691 region:rollup2
BACK TO THAT KIND ISSUE BEFORE.

00:55:57.621 --> 00:56:02.192 region:rollup2
BE VESTED IN AND HOUSING WATER

00:56:00.691 --> 00:56:03.093 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE YOUR

00:56:02.192 --> 00:56:05.229 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION WHAT HAVE YOU

00:56:03.093 --> 00:56:06.964 region:rollup2
ITSELF. NO THAT'S HELP THAT'S A

00:56:05.229 --> 00:56:08.865 region:rollup2
A ONE TIME NOT I'M GOING TO

00:56:06.964 --> 00:56:10.667 region:rollup2
ASSUME THAT SKYNET THAT.

00:56:08.865 --> 00:56:12.169 region:rollup2
THAT I PERSPECTIVE THAT

00:56:10.667 --> 00:56:13.203 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LAYS OUT

00:56:12.169 --> 00:56:14.738 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT THIS

00:56:13.203 --> 00:56:16.640 region:rollup2
SILLY BEING IRRESPONSIBLE AND

00:56:14.738 --> 00:56:19.543 region:rollup2
DOING ONGOING EXPENDITURES BUT

00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:20.878 region:rollup2
USING. THAT AS FOR FOR ONE TIME

00:56:19.543 --> 00:56:23.780 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE PURPOSE WE DON'T

00:56:20.878 --> 00:56:25.549 region:rollup2
HAVE. A LIMIT ON HOW MUCH WE CAN

00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:27.284 region:rollup2
SPEND ON SOCIAL SERVICES OR

00:56:25.549 --> 00:56:28.852 region:rollup2
EDUCATION OR INFRASTRUCTURE

00:56:27.284 --> 00:56:30.287 region:rollup2
THERE ARE NO LIMITS.

00:56:28.852 --> 00:56:32.022 region:rollup2
IN OUR BUDGET PROCESS THERE'S A

00:56:30.287 --> 00:56:33.890 region:rollup2
LIMIT ON HOW MUCH WE CAN PUT

00:56:32.022 --> 00:56:35.892 region:rollup2
INTO RESERVES TODAY UNLESS THE

00:56:33.890 --> 00:56:38.695 region:rollup2
LA WHAT'S WRONG.

00:56:35.892 --> 00:56:40.497 region:rollup2
THERE IS A LIMIT AND AND WHY

00:56:38.695 --> 00:56:41.965 region:rollup2
WOULD WE DO THAT TO OURSELVES.

00:56:40.497 --> 00:56:43.500 region:rollup2
I'M NOT SUGGESTING THE PUTTING

00:56:41.965 --> 00:56:44.601 region:rollup2
MONEY INTO RESERVES IS MORE

00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:46.603 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THAN SPENDING ON

00:56:44.601 --> 00:56:47.804 region:rollup2
SOCIAL SERVICES OR EDUCATION OR

00:56:46.603 --> 00:56:49.907 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER PROGRAMS I'M NOT

00:56:47.804 --> 00:56:51.742 region:rollup2
SUGGESTING THAT. THIS IS MORE OF

00:56:49.907 --> 00:56:53.143 region:rollup2
A TECHNICAL PROPOSAL.

00:56:51.742 --> 00:56:55.445 region:rollup2
BY THE WAY THE PROPOSAL REALLY

00:56:53.143 --> 00:56:56.313 region:rollup2
BEFORE US IS NOT. IS JUST A.

00:56:55.445 --> 00:56:57.147 region:rollup2
CREATE THAT ACCOUNT.

00:56:56.313 --> 00:56:59.149 region:rollup2
THAT'S RIGHT

00:56:57.147 --> 00:57:00.484 region:rollup2
THAT'S RIGHT

00:56:59.149 --> 00:57:01.585 region:rollup2
ARM AND THEN IT'S UP TO THE

00:57:00.484 --> 00:57:02.653 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE TO DECIDE HOW TO

00:57:01.585 --> 00:57:04.655 region:rollup2
SPEND.

00:57:02.653 --> 00:57:05.956 region:rollup2
THE SURPLUS.

00:57:04.655 --> 00:57:07.491 region:rollup2
BUT TO ME IT'S BIZARRE WHEN

00:57:05.956 --> 00:57:09.259 region:rollup2
WE'RE TOLD RIGHT UP FRONT OH YOU

00:57:07.491 --> 00:57:10.827 region:rollup2
CAN'T YOU CAN'T PUT ANY MORE

00:57:09.259 --> 00:57:12.229 region:rollup2
MONEY IN RESERVES IS OFF THE

00:57:10.827 --> 00:57:13.930 region:rollup2
TABLE BECAUSE OFTHE STRUCTURE

00:57:12.229 --> 00:57:14.965 region:rollup2
OF OUR BUDGET PROCESS.

00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:16.900 region:rollup2
TO ME THAT'S A FALSE CHOICE

00:57:14.965 --> 00:57:18.568 region:rollup2
TO SHARE.

00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:20.270 region:rollup2
AND THEN ALSO DURING A RECESSION

00:57:18.568 --> 00:57:21.138 region:rollup2
WOULD PROGRAM FOR CUT. WHAT

00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:23.040 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS WERE CUT SOCIAL

00:57:21.138 --> 00:57:24.107 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS?

00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:25.809 region:rollup2
THAT'S STILL NOT RECOVERED WHO

00:57:24.107 --> 00:57:27.611 region:rollup2
GOT IT FIRST.

00:57:25.809 --> 00:57:30.314 region:rollup2
WHAT'S ALSO ON MY MIND EXCUSE ME

00:57:27.611 --> 00:57:32.616 region:rollup2
IS WHEN WE CAME IN.

00:57:30.314 --> 00:57:34.584 region:rollup2
OUR CLASS BECAME MEN AND.

00:57:32.616 --> 00:57:36.386 region:rollup2
DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWELVE.

00:57:34.584 --> 00:57:39.489 region:rollup2
OUR PREDECESSORS

00:57:36.386 --> 00:57:41.825 region:rollup2
HAD EXPERIENCED A BRUTAL.

00:57:39.489 --> 00:57:43.860 region:rollup2
SERIES OF BUDGET CUTS AND I TOLD

00:57:41.825 --> 00:57:44.928 region:rollup2
MYSELF I DON'T WANT TO EVER DO I

00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:46.663 region:rollup2
DON'T WANT TO GO THROUGH THAT

00:57:44.928 --> 00:57:47.931 region:rollup2
IT'S WRONG. TO OUR CONSTITUENTS

00:57:46.663 --> 00:57:49.333 region:rollup2
IT'S WRONG FOR THE LEGISLATURE

00:57:47.931 --> 00:57:50.634 region:rollup2
TO HAVE TO.

00:57:49.333 --> 00:57:52.736 region:rollup2
CUT PROGRAMS THAT ARE SO

00:57:50.634 --> 00:57:55.138 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO PEOPLE SO WE SHOULD

00:57:52.736 --> 00:57:56.306 region:rollup2
SAVE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

00:57:55.138 --> 00:57:57.975 region:rollup2
ON MY LIKE THE RAINY DAY FUND I

00:57:56.306 --> 00:57:59.810 region:rollup2
JUST I I THINK WE NEED TO GO A

00:57:57.975 --> 00:58:06.616 region:rollup2
STEP BEYOND THAT SIMPLY TO GIVE

00:57:59.810 --> 00:58:08.051 region:rollup2
OURSELVES THE FLEXIBILITY.

00:58:06.616 --> 00:58:09.353 region:rollup2
YEAH BIGGEST MIGHT I ADD TO THAT

00:58:08.051 --> 00:58:11.355 region:rollup2
DOWN.

00:58:09.353 --> 00:58:12.389 region:rollup2
I CERTAINLY. AGREE WITH A SPEAR

00:58:11.355 --> 00:58:14.491 region:rollup2
MR MCCARTY COMMENTS IN THE SENSE

00:58:12.389 --> 00:58:16.126 region:rollup2
THAT ANY ADDITIONAL DOLLARS

00:58:14.491 --> 00:58:17.694 region:rollup2
ABOUT FOR. THOSE CAPS GET

00:58:16.126 --> 00:58:19.463 region:rollup2
INVESTED IN INFRASTRUCTURE UNDER

00:58:17.694 --> 00:58:20.964 region:rollup2
CURRENT LAW.

00:58:19.463 --> 00:58:22.299 region:rollup2
BOB I WOULD ECHO. MISSION

00:58:20.964 --> 00:58:23.266 region:rollup2
DAILIES COMMENTS AND ALL THIS

00:58:22.299 --> 00:58:25.235 region:rollup2
DOES IS PROVIDERS THAT

00:58:23.266 --> 00:58:27.204 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY BUT YOU

00:58:25.235 --> 00:58:28.438 region:rollup2
AND I BOTH KNOW. I AND I THINK

00:58:27.204 --> 00:58:31.174 region:rollup2
BOTH OF US HAD THE OPPORTUNITY

00:58:28.438 --> 00:58:33.043 region:rollup2
TO FOR HAVE A FRONT ROW SEAT.

00:58:31.174 --> 00:58:33.543 region:rollup2
TO THOSE DEEP CUTS

00:58:33.043 --> 00:58:34.778 region:rollup2
I AS WE WERE HERE AT THE

00:58:33.543 --> 00:58:36.546 region:rollup2
CAPITOL.

00:58:34.778 --> 00:58:37.948 region:rollup2
DURING THOSE YEARS THAT THOSE

00:58:36.546 --> 00:58:39.716 region:rollup2
CUTS WERE MADE.

00:58:37.948 --> 00:58:40.917 region:rollup2
NOT MARKER POSITIONS IS ELECTED

00:58:39.716 --> 00:58:42.252 region:rollup2
OFFICIALS BUT CERTAIN AS PART OF

00:58:40.917 --> 00:58:43.720 region:rollup2
THIS INSTITUTION.

00:58:42.252 --> 00:58:45.655 region:rollup2
AND THE REALITY IS THAT EACH AND

00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:46.556 region:rollup2
EVERY YEAR THE LEGISLATURE

00:58:45.655 --> 00:58:47.657 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE PROCESS OF

00:58:46.556 --> 00:58:48.992 region:rollup2
COMPROMISE DISCUSSION

00:58:47.657 --> 00:58:50.961 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATION AND THE BUDGET

00:58:48.992 --> 00:58:52.529 region:rollup2
CONTINUES TO SPEND ADDITIONAL

00:58:50.961 --> 00:58:54.331 region:rollup2
DOLLARS ON ONGOING PROGRAMS SO

00:58:52.529 --> 00:58:56.099 region:rollup2
IF THE REALITY WERE THIS YEAR WE

00:58:54.331 --> 00:58:57.034 region:rollup2
WERE GONNA MAKE ALL CHOICES FOR

00:58:56.099 --> 00:58:57.601 region:rollup2
THE ENTIRETY OF THE SURPLUS ONLY

00:58:57.034 --> 00:58:59.336 region:rollup2
TO GO. TO ONE TIME SPENDING

00:58:57.601 --> 00:59:01.905 region:rollup2
THEN.

00:58:59.336 --> 00:59:03.907 region:rollup2
PERHAPS THE CURRENT STRUCTURE

00:59:01.905 --> 00:59:05.308 region:rollup2
WOULD BE SUFFICIENT I BUT WE

00:59:03.907 --> 00:59:06.743 region:rollup2
BOTH KNOW THAT'S NOT REALITY AND

00:59:05.308 --> 00:59:08.145 region:rollup2
NOT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH

00:59:06.743 --> 00:59:09.646 region:rollup2
THE STATE BUDGET SO I THINK.

00:59:08.145 --> 00:59:11.214 region:rollup2
GIVING OURSELVES AT LEAST THE

00:59:09.646 --> 00:59:12.382 region:rollup2
CHOICE TO PUT ASIDE ISSUE

00:59:11.214 --> 00:59:14.451 region:rollup2
REVENUES TO PROTECT SOME THAT

00:59:12.382 --> 00:59:15.852 region:rollup2
ARE GOING SPENDING A AS WE MAKE

00:59:14.451 --> 00:59:16.520 region:rollup2
THOSE CHOICES.

00:59:15.852 --> 00:59:18.855 region:rollup2
AS A BODY.

00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:19.856 region:rollup2
SEEMS LIKE RATIONAL POLICY TO

00:59:18.855 --> 00:59:21.758 region:rollup2
GET STILL.

00:59:19.856 --> 00:59:23.026 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO MANDATE WITHIN THIS

00:59:21.758 --> 00:59:24.327 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR PROPOSAL TO PUT A

00:59:23.026 --> 00:59:25.028 region:rollup2
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY ASIDE

00:59:24.327 --> 00:59:26.363 region:rollup2
SHIP PERCENTAGE WOULD JUST

00:59:25.028 --> 00:59:28.965 region:rollup2
SIMPLY GIVE US THE FLEXIBILITY

00:59:26.363 --> 00:59:31.668 region:rollup2
IF WE. DEEM IT APPROPRIATE

00:59:28.965 --> 00:59:33.804 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE TO DO SO.

00:59:31.668 --> 00:59:35.072 region:rollup2
THANK YOU DOCTOR RENTAL.

00:59:33.804 --> 00:59:37.407 region:rollup2
THIS QUESTION IS FROM US COST

00:59:35.072 --> 00:59:40.210 region:rollup2
ACTING YOU EDUCATE THIS BODY ON

00:59:37.407 --> 00:59:42.179 region:rollup2
THE CAP OF THE BSA IF THERE WERE

00:59:40.210 --> 00:59:44.681 region:rollup2
ANY LGISLATIVE OR STATUTORY

00:59:42.179 --> 00:59:47.117 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY TO INCREASE THE CAP.

00:59:44.681 --> 00:59:48.952 region:rollup2
WHAT COULD WE FEASIBLY DO TO TRY

00:59:47.117 --> 00:59:50.487 region:rollup2
TO INCREASE THE RESERVES AS HAS

00:59:48.952 --> 00:59:52.155 region:rollup2
BEEN STATED HERE?

00:59:50.487 --> 00:59:54.091 region:rollup2
SURE AND I ALSO WANT TO KNOW A

00:59:52.155 --> 00:59:54.591 region:rollup2
DULY NOTED TO MISTER OBERNOLTE

00:59:54.091 --> 00:59:56.726 region:rollup2
ON.

00:59:54.591 --> 00:59:57.894 region:rollup2
ASSET FOR YOU NOT BEING A CAP

00:59:56.726 --> 00:59:59.496 region:rollup2
AT THE TRIGGER SAID JUST MEAN

00:59:57.894 --> 01:00:00.530 region:rollup2
THERE'S CHOICES TO BE MADE BASED

00:59:59.496 --> 01:00:02.933 region:rollup2
ON THE LEVEL OF FUNDING YOU

01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:04.234 region:rollup2
PROVIDE WITHIN CERTAIN RESERVES.

01:00:02.933 --> 01:00:05.235 region:rollup2
SO IT IS THE CONSTITUTIONAL

01:00:04.234 --> 01:00:06.636 region:rollup2
PROVISION AND I WOULD NOTE

01:00:05.235 --> 01:00:07.771 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION TWO WAS PASSED

01:00:06.636 --> 01:00:09.406 region:rollup2
OVERWHELMINGLY BY THE

01:00:07.771 --> 01:00:11.608 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE AT THE TIME AND

01:00:09.406 --> 01:00:13.243 region:rollup2
RECEIVED VERY HIGH. UP VOTE

01:00:11.608 --> 01:00:14.544 region:rollup2
MARGIN FROM VOTERS ON IN

01:00:13.243 --> 01:00:16.413 region:rollup2
BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS ONCE

01:00:14.544 --> 01:00:17.347 region:rollup2
YOU REACH THAT TEN PERCENT OF

01:00:16.413 --> 01:00:18.815 region:rollup2
THE BILLION DOLLARS IN

01:00:17.347 --> 01:00:20.984 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE I'M CITING IS THE

01:00:18.815 --> 01:00:22.519 region:rollup2
PROVISION OF PROPOSITION TWO

01:00:20.984 --> 01:00:24.287 region:rollup2
WHICH BASICALLY STATES THAT.

01:00:22.519 --> 01:00:26.690 region:rollup2
ONCE YOU REACH THE TEN PERCENT

01:00:24.287 --> 01:00:28.825 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTIONAL TARGET THE HOT

01:00:26.690 --> 01:00:30.627 region:rollup2
SPILLOVER AMOUNT IS THAN FUNDED

01:00:28.825 --> 01:00:32.095 region:rollup2
UP FOR INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS

01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:33.130 region:rollup2
AND RIGHT NOW WORK PROJECTING

01:00:32.095 --> 01:00:34.598 region:rollup2
THAT TO BE ABOUT A BILLION

01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:36.466 region:rollup2
DOLLARS.

01:00:34.598 --> 01:00:38.168 region:rollup2
ON AND SO I THINK YOU KNOW THE

01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:40.237 region:rollup2
UNDERPINNING OF THE POLICY AT

01:00:38.168 --> 01:00:41.605 region:rollup2
THE TIME WAS AGAIN THINKING

01:00:40.237 --> 01:00:43.340 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A

01:00:41.605 --> 01:00:44.875 region:rollup2
RELATIVELY VOLATILE REVENUE

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:46.443 region:rollup2
SOURCE. AND THAT SOME OF THE

01:00:44.875 --> 01:00:48.044 region:rollup2
CALCULATION OF PROPOSITION TWO

01:00:46.443 --> 01:00:49.779 region:rollup2
IS ACTUALLY BASED OFF CAPITAL

01:00:48.044 --> 01:00:51.715 region:rollup2
GAINS ONE OF THE MOST VOLATILE

01:00:49.779 --> 01:00:53.750 region:rollup2
REVENUE SOURCES WE HAVE. HE'D

01:00:51.715 --> 01:00:56.386 region:rollup2
REALLY VIEW THAT AS ONE TIME IN

01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:58.522 region:rollup2
NATURE AND SO INFRASTRUCTURE IS

01:00:56.386 --> 01:01:00.157 region:rollup2
A REASONABLE PLACE TO INVEST ONE

01:00:58.522 --> 01:01:01.992 region:rollup2
TIME DOLLARS.

01:01:00.157 --> 01:01:03.393 region:rollup2
I KNOW WE PUT OUT A FIVE YEAR

01:01:01.992 --> 01:01:05.162 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN RIGHT NOW

01:01:03.393 --> 01:01:07.130 region:rollup2
WITH SIXTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS

01:01:05.162 --> 01:01:07.797 region:rollup2
IN STATE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS.

01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:09.166 region:rollup2
AND SO.

01:01:07.797 --> 01:01:10.967 region:rollup2
PART OF THE UNDERPINNING OF

01:01:09.166 --> 01:01:11.902 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION TWO THE OTHER

01:01:10.967 --> 01:01:13.303 region:rollup2
PORTION IS OF COURSE FOR PAYING

01:01:11.902 --> 01:01:15.272 region:rollup2
OFF SOME DEBTS.

01:01:13.303 --> 01:01:16.306 region:rollup2
AND SO THERE'S THE RESERVE BUT

01:01:15.272 --> 01:01:17.974 region:rollup2
THEN THERE'S ALSO DEBTS AND

01:01:16.306 --> 01:01:19.876 region:rollup2
LIABILITIES THAT WERE PAIN DOWN

01:01:17.974 --> 01:01:21.711 region:rollup2
THROUGH PROP TO. INFRASTRUCTURE

01:01:19.876 --> 01:01:23.046 region:rollup2
SEEMED A REASONABLE PLACE TO

01:01:21.711 --> 01:01:25.549 region:rollup2
MAKE SOME OF THOSE ONE TIME

01:01:23.046 --> 01:01:27.350 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT GOING FORWARD SO IT

01:01:25.549 --> 01:01:29.419 region:rollup2
REALLY IS A POLICY QUESTION ON

01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:31.588 region:rollup2
IN OUR VIEW PROPOSITION TWO

01:01:29.419 --> 01:01:33.256 region:rollup2
ALLOWED US TO TAKE CARE OF SOME

01:01:31.588 --> 01:01:33.590 region:rollup2
LIABILITIES WE HAD.

01:01:33.256 --> 01:01:36.426 region:rollup2
TO.

01:01:33.590 --> 01:01:38.662 region:rollup2
COME UP WITH A ROBUST RESERVE

01:01:36.426 --> 01:01:40.197 region:rollup2
ON LA ELBOW OFTEN TESTIFYING

01:01:38.662 --> 01:01:41.998 region:rollup2
IT'S THE TRUTH IN BUDGETING. THE

01:01:40.197 --> 01:01:43.500 region:rollup2
RESERVE AMOUNT.

01:01:41.998 --> 01:01:45.669 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THAT REALLY DEPENDS ON

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:48.305 region:rollup2
HOW RISK ADVERSE YOU ARE.

01:01:45.669 --> 01:01:50.073 region:rollup2
A AND THERE IS NO MAGIC NUMBER

01:01:48.305 --> 01:01:51.641 region:rollup2
FOR THE RIGHT RESERVE AMOUNTS.

01:01:50.073 --> 01:01:52.242 region:rollup2
ON TEN PERCENT I THINK MOST

01:01:51.641 --> 01:01:54.177 region:rollup2
PEOPLE FIND PRUDENT ARE MEANT

01:01:52.242 --> 01:01:56.613 region:rollup2
TO.

01:01:54.177 --> 01:01:57.948 region:rollup2
MISS WEBBER'S POINT BALANCING

01:01:56.613 --> 01:01:59.783 region:rollup2
THAT AGAINST SOME OF THE

01:01:57.948 --> 01:02:01.284 region:rollup2
PROGRAMMATIC NEEDS THAT WE HAVE

01:01:59.783 --> 01:02:03.353 region:rollup2
IN THE BUDGET.

01:02:01.284 --> 01:02:05.055 region:rollup2
I'M AND SO WE REMAIN COMMITTED

01:02:03.353 --> 01:02:06.323 region:rollup2
TO TRYING TO INVEST IN

01:02:05.055 --> 01:02:08.992 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH FULLY

01:02:06.323 --> 01:02:11.227 region:rollup2
FUNDING THE BSAA ALLOWS US TO.

01:02:08.992 --> 01:02:12.062 region:rollup2
AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS

01:02:11.227 --> 01:02:14.831 region:rollup2
AND.

01:02:12.062 --> 01:02:16.433 region:rollup2
HONESTLY WOULD LIKE MORE WATER

01:02:14.831 --> 01:02:16.1000 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE IF WE HAVE RIGHT

01:02:16.433 --> 01:02:19.302 region:rollup2
AWAY TO. PUT A BIAS IN THERE

01:02:16.1000 --> 01:02:21.972 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:02:19.302 --> 01:02:24.574 region:rollup2
I GUESS THE QUESTION REALLY WAS

01:02:21.972 --> 01:02:26.376 region:rollup2
TO ASK IF WE AS A BODY ARE A BIT

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:28.278 region:rollup2
MORE RISK ADVERSE WHAT WOULD WE

01:02:26.376 --> 01:02:30.080 region:rollup2
NEED TO DO IF WE WANTED TO

01:02:28.278 --> 01:02:31.381 region:rollup2
INCREASE BEYOND THE TEN PERCENT.

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:33.883 region:rollup2
AND DO WE HAVE THE STATUTORY

01:02:31.381 --> 01:02:36.219 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY TO HELP TO CHANGE.

01:02:33.883 --> 01:02:37.921 region:rollup2
THAT PERCENTAGE IF WE SO CHOSE

01:02:36.219 --> 01:02:39.389 region:rollup2
TO AND WHAT WOULD WE NEED TO DO

01:02:37.921 --> 01:02:40.991 region:rollup2
TO DO THAT.

01:02:39.389 --> 01:02:42.025 region:rollup2
YEAH THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO

01:02:40.991 --> 01:02:43.126 region:rollup2
CREATE A RESERVE FUND IN THE

01:02:42.025 --> 01:02:45.662 region:rollup2
MEDIA THAT THE BUDGET ALL THE

01:02:43.126 --> 01:02:47.764 region:rollup2
TIME AND DIFFERENT FUND SOURCES.

01:02:45.662 --> 01:02:49.499 region:rollup2
AFFECT YOU AS WINE PSA IS ONE

01:02:47.764 --> 01:02:50.300 region:rollup2
THAT WAS CONSTITUTIONALLY AND

01:02:49.499 --> 01:02:51.935 region:rollup2
CREATED.

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:53.236 region:rollup2
ON THE OTHER QUESTION THAT I

01:02:51.935 --> 01:02:54.271 region:rollup2
THINK IS AN APPROPRIATE ONE THAT

01:02:53.236 --> 01:02:56.239 region:rollup2
MR MCCARTY RAISES THE

01:02:54.271 --> 01:02:57.340 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY THE BILL BEFORE YOU

01:02:56.239 --> 01:02:58.975 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY MIRRORS MANY OF THE

01:02:57.340 --> 01:03:00.644 region:rollup2
RESTRICTIONS THAT YOU HOP AND

01:02:58.975 --> 01:03:02.245 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION TWO. WHICH WOULD

01:03:00.644 --> 01:03:03.613 region:rollup2
REQUIRE THE GOVERNOR TO DECLARE

01:03:02.245 --> 01:03:04.881 region:rollup2
A STATE OF EMERGENCY EITHER

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:07.083 region:rollup2
THROUGH A NATURAL DISASTER A

01:03:04.881 --> 01:03:09.486 region:rollup2
FISCAL EMERGENCY. SO I THINK IT

01:03:07.083 --> 01:03:11.421 region:rollup2
WAS AT A GOOD POINT TO LOOK AT

01:03:09.486 --> 01:03:12.656 region:rollup2
THIS AND REALLY TWO VENUES.

01:03:11.421 --> 01:03:13.356 region:rollup2
THE AMOUNTS AND WHAT YOU THINK

01:03:12.656 --> 01:03:15.191 region:rollup2
IS APPROPRIATE AND THE

01:03:13.356 --> 01:03:17.794 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY.

01:03:15.191 --> 01:03:19.829 region:rollup2
ON AND SO IN SOME WAYS ON THE

01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:22.399 region:rollup2
BILL BEFORE YOU REPLICATES THE

01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:24.301 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE OF PROPOSITION TWO AND

01:03:22.399 --> 01:03:26.269 region:rollup2
SO THAT THE POLICY QUESTION. ON

01:03:24.301 --> 01:03:27.904 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THAT AFFORD

01:03:26.269 --> 01:03:29.539 region:rollup2
YOU ENOUGH FLEXIBILITY. IN

01:03:27.904 --> 01:03:31.241 region:rollup2
ESSENCE IT REPLICATES THE

01:03:29.539 --> 01:03:31.908 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE OF PROP TWO AND

01:03:31.241 --> 01:03:34.377 region:rollup2
CIRCUMVENTS.

01:03:31.908 --> 01:03:36.146 region:rollup2
THE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT

01:03:34.377 --> 01:03:37.213 region:rollup2
THAT'S REQUIRED UNDER PROP TWO

01:03:36.146 --> 01:03:39.149 region:rollup2
AND I'M NOT A LAWYER SO I DON'T

01:03:37.213 --> 01:03:40.050 region:rollup2
ONE OPINE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

01:03:39.149 --> 01:03:45.989 region:rollup2
THAT CAN BE.

01:03:40.050 --> 01:03:47.957 region:rollup2
ACCOMPLISH STATUTORILY OR NOT.

THE ANALYSIS BY THE DEPARTMENT

01:04:03.807 --> 01:04:07.143 region:rollup2
OF FINANCING IS VERY VERY

01:04:05.308 --> 01:04:10.013 region:rollup2
