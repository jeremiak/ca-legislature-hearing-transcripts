ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS HAVE BEEN ON

00:02:55.875 --> 00:02:56.876
SOME OF THESE ISSUES SINCE THE

00:02:56.943 --> 00:02:58.444
PASSAGE OF THE DOMESTIC WORKERS

00:02:58.511 --> 00:03:00.513

00:03:17.764 --> 00:03:19.632
DOMESTIC WORKERS.

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:20.767
THERE ARE SOME LIMITATIONS IN

00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:23.036
OUR SYSTEM FOR HOW WE CATEGORIZE

00:03:23.102 --> 00:03:26.673
THOSE SO WE DO URGE SOME CAUTION.

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:27.874
BUT ROUGHLY WE FOUND IN THAT

00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:29.475
TIME PERIOD ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:31.077
CLAIMS FELL WITHIN THE CRITERIA

00:03:31.144 --> 00:03:33.346
THAT WE THINK ARE IDENTIFIED AS

00:03:33.413 --> 00:03:36.115
A DOMESTIC WORKER.

00:03:36.182 --> 00:03:37.417
IN OUR EVALUATION OF THOSE

00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:39.152
CLAIMS WE FOUND THAT WORKERS

00:03:39.218 --> 00:03:41.588
REPORTED AN AVERAGE HOURLY WAGE

00:03:41.654 --> 00:03:43.723

AND THE MEDIAN WAS ELEVEN

00:03:46.092 --> 00:03:50.229
DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS.

00:03:50.296 --> 00:03:51.531
IN THE YEARS THAT WE EXAMINE

00:03:51.598 --> 00:03:52.832
THOSE.

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:54.200
ROUGHLY FOUR AND FIVE WORKERS

00:03:54.267 --> 00:03:56.536
REPORTED HOURLY WAGES AT WORK

00:03:56.603 --> 00:03:58.571
SEEDING THE MINIMUM WAGE.

00:03:58.638 --> 00:04:00.740
HOWEVER ONE IN TEN REPORTED.

00:04:00.807 --> 00:04:02.041
THAT THEY RECEIVE LESS THAN THE

00:04:02.108 --> 00:04:03.176
MINIMUM WAGE.

00:04:03.242 --> 00:04:05.545
WITH MINIMAL HAVING ANY OF THEIR

00:04:05.612 --> 00:04:08.247
CLAIMS RELATED TO OVER TIME.

00:04:08.314 --> 00:04:10.149
HOWEVER WE DO URGE CAUTION WHEN

00:04:10.216 --> 00:04:11.517
LOOKING AT THOSE STATISTICS

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:13.486
THERE ARE MANY BARRIERS THAT

00:04:13.553 --> 00:04:15.655
PREVENT US FROM UNDERSTANDING

00:04:15.722 --> 00:04:17.023
THE TRUE NATURE OF THE DATA.

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.924
THEY'RE ALSO BARRIERS TO

00:04:17.991 --> 00:04:19.392

I'M.

00:04:21.494 --> 00:04:23.296
IT IS DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING

00:04:23.363 --> 00:04:25.231
FOR OUR FIELD ENFORCEMENT -- TO

00:04:25.298 --> 00:04:26.532
ENTER THE PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:27.834
BECAUSE THAT IS OFTEN A CLIENT'S

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.003
HOME AND WE TYPICALLY ENTER

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:33.239
WORKPLACES -- THAT ARE NOT THAT

00:04:33.306 --> 00:04:34.841

THERE ARE ALSO CONSTRAINTS AND

00:04:39.746 --> 00:04:41.547
BARRIERS THAT WE THAT WE ARE

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:43.416
TRYING TO IDENTIFY WHERE WORKERS

00:04:43.483 --> 00:04:45.952
MAY BE HESITANT TO BRING A CLAIM.

00:04:46.019 --> 00:04:47.353
THERE IS FEAR OF LOSS OF JOBS

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.522
AND OR BENEFITS SUCH AS ROOM AND

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:50.556

OF THESE CLAIMS.

00:04:54.527 --> 00:04:56.295

00:52:13.063 --> 00:52:15.298
THOSE ARE BOTH IN LAW AND IN

00:52:15.365 --> 00:52:16.066
PRACTICE.

00:52:16.132 --> 00:52:19.369
ALLOWING PARENTS TO TAKE THAT

00:52:19.436 --> 00:52:19.836
LEAVE TIME [inaudible]

00:52:19.903 --> 00:52:21.404
I'M.

00:52:21.471 --> 00:52:21.838
IN ADDITION OF THOSE

00:52:21.905 --> 00:52:22.439
CONSIDERATIONS THE ONLY OTHER

00:52:22.506 --> 00:52:23.240
POINT WE WOULD RAISE IS THAT --

00:52:23.306 --> 00:52:24.641
IN  RECENT REPORT WE'VE WE

00:52:24.708 --> 00:52:26.877
WORKED ON WE WANTED TO GET A

00:52:26.943 --> 00:52:29.045
SENSE OF THREAT PROVIDE SOME

00:52:29.112 --> 00:52:30.080
THINKING FILLED THE SUBCOMMITTEE

00:52:30.146 --> 00:52:31.681
OF THE LEGISLATURE ON HOW TO GO

00:52:31.748 --> 00:52:33.016
ABOUT IT ACTUALLY.

00:52:33.083 --> 00:52:34.317
FUNDING EXPANDED WE'VE BEEN

00:52:34.384 --> 00:52:35.852
AFFECTS THE MINISTRATION IS.

00:52:35.919 --> 00:52:37.053
PROPOSING A TASK FORCE TO LOOK

00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:38.622
AT THESE ISSUES BUT TO SORT OF

00:52:38.688 --> 00:52:39.789
THE STARTING PLACE.

00:52:39.856 --> 00:52:42.792
ON WE HAVEN'T SCORED A SPECIFIC

00:52:42.859 --> 00:52:44.661
PROPOSAL BECAUSE THERE ISN'T A

00:52:44.728 --> 00:52:46.429
SPECIFIC -- PROPOSAL TO LOOK AT

00:52:46.496 --> 00:52:49.633
YET BUT WE THOUGHT MORE BROADLY

00:52:49.699 --> 00:52:50.534
I'M.

00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:51.401
THINKING OF THE CURRENT

00:52:51.468 --> 00:52:52.736
FINANCING STRUCTURE THE PAYROLL

00:52:52.802 --> 00:52:54.204
TAX AND AND THE BENEFIT

00:52:54.271 --> 00:52:55.839
STRUCTURE.

00:52:55.906 --> 00:52:58.608
UNDER STATE LAW THE PAYROLL TAX

00:52:58.675 --> 00:52:59.776
AS DIRECTOR ANY MENTION

00:52:59.843 --> 00:53:00.877
FLUCTUATES UPWARD OR DOWNWARD TO

00:53:00.944 --> 00:53:02.779
BALANCE THE FUND -- BUT IT'S

00:53:02.846 --> 00:53:05.682
CAPPED AT ONE POINT 5% OF A ROLE

00:53:05.749 --> 00:53:06.950
TAX.

00:53:07.017 --> 00:53:09.553
AND SO ON CURRENTLY IT'S ABOUT

00:53:09.619 --> 00:53:11.021
1%.

00:53:11.087 --> 00:53:12.122
WE SAID WELL BY HOW MUCH COULD

00:53:12.188 --> 00:53:13.924
BENEFITS BE EXPANDED IN DOLLAR

00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:15.492
TERMS.

00:53:15.559 --> 00:53:16.693
IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM WHILE

00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:19.596
STAYING UNDER THE ONE POINT 5%.

00:53:19.663 --> 00:53:20.997
YES JUST ONE QUESTION SIR BEFORE

00:53:21.064 --> 00:53:22.465
YOU GO FORWARD OF COURSE BUT

00:53:22.532 --> 00:53:24.768
WITH REGARDS TO THE ONE ISN'T

00:53:24.834 --> 00:53:28.805
THERE OF MAX ON THEIR EARNINGS.

00:53:28.872 --> 00:53:31.441
IT'S NOT IT'S NOT ALL EARNING

00:53:31.508 --> 00:53:32.642
THAT THAT'S RIGHT RECORD YOUNG

00:53:32.709 --> 00:53:33.877
EXPLAINED THAT THE CURRENT

00:53:33.944 --> 00:53:35.612
PAYROLL TAX IS PLAYED BY COVERED

00:53:35.679 --> 00:53:39.149
EMPLOYERS AT 1% OF THEIR WAGES.

00:53:39.215 --> 00:53:41.585
UP TO A HUNDRED AND TWENTY

00:53:41.651 --> 00:53:44.387
THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR -- SO

00:53:44.454 --> 00:53:46.289
PLEASE EXCUSE ME.

00:53:46.356 --> 00:53:47.223
PARDON ME THANK YOU -- EMPLOYEES

00:53:47.290 --> 00:53:49.593
PAY A PAYROLL TAX UP TO ABOUT A

00:53:49.659 --> 00:53:50.427
HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND

00:53:50.493 --> 00:53:51.795
DOLLARS A YEAR THAT INCREASES

00:53:51.861 --> 00:53:53.463
EACH YEAR MORE OR LESS WITH THE

00:53:53.530 --> 00:53:55.198
RATE OF WAGE INFLATION -- BUT

00:53:55.265 --> 00:53:57.334
BEYOND THAT AMOUNT EMPLOYEES NOT

00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:59.369
A PAYROLL TAX.

00:53:59.436 --> 00:53:59.569
OKAY.

00:53:59.636 --> 00:54:01.037
I'M.

00:54:01.104 --> 00:54:02.505
SO I THINK THEY DON'T PAY OR

00:54:02.572 --> 00:54:04.140
DOES THE IT'LL BE ON THE

00:54:04.207 --> 00:54:05.008
EARNINGS ABOVE THAT AMOUNT SO%

00:54:05.075 --> 00:54:08.612
JUST ON THE BASE ONE HUNDRED

00:54:08.678 --> 00:54:09.579
TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IMAGES --

00:54:09.646 --> 00:54:10.714
IN THINKING ABOUT THE CURRENT

00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:13.049
STRUCTURE -- WITH -- RAN SOME

00:54:13.116 --> 00:54:14.551
SCENARIOS AND OBVIOUSLY SUBJECT

00:54:14.618 --> 00:54:15.852
TO SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE

00:54:15.919 --> 00:54:17.520
FUTURE BUT WE THINK.

00:54:17.587 --> 00:54:18.955
THAT PAYROLL TAXES ON THAT

00:54:19.022 --> 00:54:22.192
EMPLOYEES PAY COULD BE INCREASED.

00:54:22.258 --> 00:54:24.761
UNDER THE EXISTING STRUCTURE --

00:54:24.828 --> 00:54:25.395
BY AT LEAST A BILLION DOLLARS A

00:54:25.462 --> 00:54:26.830
YEAR.

00:54:26.896 --> 00:54:28.365
AND BUT NOT LIKELY MORE THAN TWO

00:54:28.431 --> 00:54:30.467
BILLION DOLLARS. TO SUPPORT

00:54:30.533 --> 00:54:32.502
ADDITIONAL PAID FAMILY LEAVE

00:54:32.569 --> 00:54:33.470
BENEFITS.

00:54:33.536 --> 00:54:35.105
OP WITHOUT.

00:54:35.171 --> 00:54:38.008
GOING ABOVE THE ONE POINT 5% CAP.

00:54:38.074 --> 00:54:39.509
AND SO THIS WE THINK IS A

00:54:39.576 --> 00:54:41.344
HELPFUL MARKER OF AND HOW HOW

00:54:41.411 --> 00:54:45.048
WOULD YOU DO THAT.

00:54:45.115 --> 00:54:46.282
THE MONEY IS IT TOO COMPLICATED

00:54:46.349 --> 00:54:48.551
NO IT'S THE FUNDING SYSTEM IS IS

00:54:48.618 --> 00:54:51.721
COMPLEX -- BUT IS DESIGNED TO

00:54:51.788 --> 00:54:53.690
BASICALLY CALCULATE THE PAYROLL

00:54:53.757 --> 00:54:56.226
TAX RATE THAT IS NECESSARY TO

00:54:56.292 --> 00:54:57.794
GENERATE CONTRIBUTIONS.

00:54:57.861 --> 00:54:59.329
THAT WOULD BALANCE OUT THE

00:54:59.396 --> 00:55:01.197
AMOUNT THAT'S WOOD IS ESTIMATED

00:55:01.264 --> 00:55:02.732
TO GO OUT AND BENEFITS SO IF THE

00:55:02.799 --> 00:55:04.367
LEGISLATURE WERE OR THE GOVERNOR

00:55:04.434 --> 00:55:06.069
IN THIS INSTANCE.

00:55:06.136 --> 00:55:08.538
IF THEY WERE TO EXPAND BENEFITS.

00:55:08.605 --> 00:55:10.106
ADDITIONAL BENEFITS WOULD GO OUT

00:55:10.173 --> 00:55:12.075
AND IN THE SUBSEQUENT YEAR THE

00:55:12.142 --> 00:55:13.476
AUTOMATIC FORMULA WITH

00:55:13.543 --> 00:55:15.578
RECALCULATE WHAT THE PAYROLL TAX

00:55:15.645 --> 00:55:16.980
RATE.

00:55:17.047 --> 00:55:18.848
ESTIMATED NEED TO BE TO GENERATE

00:55:18.915 --> 00:55:20.150
CONTRIBUTIONS TO COVER THOSE

00:55:20.216 --> 00:55:21.584
BENEFITS SO THERE'S A SORT OF

00:55:21.651 --> 00:55:23.420
CIRCULAR.

00:55:23.486 --> 00:55:24.521
A SELF ADJUSTING MECHANISM

00:55:24.587 --> 00:55:24.821
[inaudible]

00:55:24.888 --> 00:55:26.322
I'M.

00:55:26.389 --> 00:55:27.824
WE THINK THE ONE BILLION TWO TWO

00:55:27.891 --> 00:55:30.293
BILLION DOLLAR MARK IS A HELPFUL

00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:31.895
BENCHMARK BECAUSE AS THE

00:55:31.961 --> 00:55:33.096
DIRECTOR MENTIONED CURRENTLY

00:55:33.163 --> 00:55:34.964
PAID FAMILY LEAVE BENEFITS FOR

00:55:35.031 --> 00:55:35.965
ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR

00:55:36.032 --> 00:55:37.333
SORT OF GIVE YOU.

00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:39.769
AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE.

00:55:39.836 --> 00:55:41.971
I'M A COUPLE POINTS.

00:55:42.038 --> 00:55:43.773
BEFORE SIR FINISHING UP HERE

00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:45.208
THAT WE WOULD MAKE OUR FIRST.

00:55:45.275 --> 00:55:46.543
ANY ADDITIONAL BENEFITS THAT ARE

00:55:46.609 --> 00:55:47.677
PROVIDED.

00:55:47.744 --> 00:55:49.813
WOULD BE WOULD RESULT IN HIGHER

00:55:49.879 --> 00:55:51.214
PAYROLL TAXES FOR WORKERS THAT

00:55:51.281 --> 00:55:54.017
THE PAY INTO THE TO THE FUND --

00:55:54.084 --> 00:55:55.819
AND SECONDLY GOING BEYOND THAT

00:55:55.885 --> 00:55:57.020
ONE TO TWO BILLION DOLLAR RANGE

00:55:57.087 --> 00:55:58.621
EXPANDED BENEFITS WOULD REQUIRE

00:55:58.688 --> 00:55:59.622
THE SUBCOMMITTEE IN THE

00:55:59.689 --> 00:56:01.725
LEGISLATURE TO IDENTIFY.

00:56:01.791 --> 00:56:04.394
OTHER FUNDING SOURCES.

00:56:04.461 --> 00:56:04.627
THANKS.

00:56:04.694 --> 00:56:07.397
THANK YOU.

00:56:07.464 --> 00:56:09.365
QUESTIONS HERE A QUICK QUESTION

00:56:09.432 --> 00:56:11.267
NUMBER OF THERE'S A PROCESS

00:56:11.334 --> 00:56:13.737
QUESTION FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU

00:56:13.803 --> 00:56:15.305
RECTOR HANDING CERTAINLY IS IT

IS IT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS THAT.

00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:17.474
WE HAVEN'T IDENTIFIED THE

00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:19.776
NECESSARY FUNDING SOURCES OF

00:56:19.843 --> 00:56:22.278
WHEN WHEN THIS COME BACK TO US

00:56:22.345 --> 00:56:24.781

US.

00:56:27.217 --> 00:56:29.519
SENATOR REID IN SOME WAY I THINK

00:56:29.586 --> 00:56:30.920
OF THE TO HARM TO FINANCE FOR

00:56:30.987 --> 00:56:32.655
SOME OF THAT -- TO AVOID THE

00:56:32.722 --> 00:56:33.323
HARD TO BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS.

00:56:33.389 --> 00:56:34.424
I THINK THIS GOVERNMENT IS

00:56:34.491 --> 00:56:35.525
MOVING PROGRESSIVELY AND I THINK

00:56:35.592 --> 00:56:37.560
YOU'LL SEE SOMETHING THIS YEAR I

00:56:37.627 --> 00:56:42.365
THINK IT'S FAIR -- A WELL I

00:56:42.432 --> 00:56:44.000
GUESS JUST TO BE STRAIGHTFORWARD --

00:56:44.067 --> 00:56:45.101
A WE DON'T HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL

00:56:45.168 --> 00:56:46.069
DETAILS OF THE THE ROLE THAT AT

00:56:46.136 --> 00:56:48.404
THIS TIME -- BUT WERE -- WERE

00:56:48.471 --> 00:56:50.707
MAGICALLY THE TASK FORCE SHOULD

00:56:50.774 --> 00:56:52.675
BE CAN BEING SEEN IN OVER THE

00:56:52.742 --> 00:56:52.942
NEXT YEAR.

00:56:53.009 --> 00:56:54.277
SOLD.

00:56:54.344 --> 00:56:55.545
OKAY SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE

00:56:55.612 --> 00:56:56.112
THIS UNTIL NEXT YEAR IS THAT

00:56:56.179 --> 00:57:01.351
WHAT YOU ANTICIPATE.

00:57:01.417 --> 00:57:03.386
AGAIN I HAVE A I THINK THAT'S

00:57:03.453 --> 00:57:05.155
SAD.

00:57:05.221 --> 00:57:07.690
I CAN'T CONFIRM WHETHER IT'LL BE --

00:57:07.757 --> 00:57:10.126
NEXT YEAR UNDER THE SUN I I'M

00:57:10.193 --> 00:57:12.695
NOT -- TO I'M NOT WRITING IN MY

00:57:12.762 --> 00:57:13.963
CAL.

00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:14.964
I'M TRYING TO GET SOME SORT OF

00:57:15.031 --> 00:57:17.667
IDEA JUST ROUGHLY WHEN YOU THINK

00:57:17.734 --> 00:57:19.102
THIS WILL COME BACK TO US.

00:57:19.169 --> 00:57:25.008
YOU KNOW GIVE OR TAKE A YEAR.

00:57:25.074 --> 00:57:26.176
I'D SAY YEAH I'M I CAN'T REALLY

00:57:26.242 --> 00:57:28.711
SAY YEAH I I ONLY HAVE THREE

00:57:28.778 --> 00:57:31.581
MORE YEARS ON THIS TERM SO.

00:57:31.648 --> 00:57:34.784
OKAY ALL RIGHT [inaudible]

00:57:34.851 --> 00:57:36.119
SENATOR NIELSEN.

00:57:36.186 --> 00:57:36.753
WELL THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT

00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:37.887
POINT.

00:57:37.954 --> 00:57:38.688
BECAUSE EVEN THE CAP CAN BE

00:57:38.755 --> 00:57:40.423
CHANGED.

00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:42.692
AND I TRUST THIS WILL BE

00:57:42.759 --> 00:57:43.293
AFFECTED IN THE TRAILER BILL

00:57:43.359 --> 00:57:43.960
CORRECT.

00:57:44.027 --> 00:57:46.529
IS THAT HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO IT.

00:57:46.596 --> 00:57:47.730
SENATE RIGHT I DON'T KNOW

00:57:47.797 --> 00:57:49.165
EXACTLY THE MECHANISM THAT

00:57:49.232 --> 00:57:51.501
THEY'LL USE I BELIEVE THAT --

00:57:51.568 --> 00:57:53.837
THIS'LL HAPPEN THAT WE HAVE THE

00:57:53.903 --> 00:57:55.038
SORT OF NORTH STAR.

00:57:55.104 --> 00:57:59.542
OF THE SIX MONTHS AS PART OF THE

00:57:59.609 --> 00:58:00.376
FINEST CORRECTLY POINTS OUT.

00:58:00.443 --> 00:58:01.444
I KNOW THAT THAT IS THE

00:58:01.511 --> 00:58:03.513
GOVERNOR'S GOAL I THINK THAT WE

00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:04.247
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO

00:58:04.314 --> 00:58:05.849
THIS IN AN APPROPRIATE FASHION

00:58:05.915 --> 00:58:08.017
TO SIT DOWN WITH.

00:58:08.084 --> 00:58:09.853
A CONVENING OF EXPERTS ON THIS

00:58:09.919 --> 00:58:10.520
ISSUE.

00:58:10.587 --> 00:58:12.655
BECAUSE OF THE SENSITIVITY OF IT

00:58:12.722 --> 00:58:14.390
BEING A WORKER BENEFIT -- AND

00:58:14.457 --> 00:58:16.059
KNOW THAT THERE IS A LOT OF

00:58:16.125 --> 00:58:18.228
CONCERN TO MAKE SURE THAT -- AND

00:58:18.294 --> 00:58:20.463
A LOT OF THE RACES THAT -- WE

00:58:20.530 --> 00:58:21.731
HAVE FROM THE LA -- I KNOW THAT

00:58:21.798 --> 00:58:23.967
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WANTS TO

00:58:24.033 --> 00:58:25.635
MOVE SMARTLY ON THIS ISSUE -- SO

00:58:25.702 --> 00:58:30.707
THE EXACT VEHICLE IT WOULD BE

00:58:30.773 --> 00:58:32.876
HARD FOR ME TO SEND.

00:58:32.942 --> 00:58:34.777
THE FINEST YOU GUYS KNOW EXACTLY

00:58:34.844 --> 00:58:35.745
AYE AYE I DON'T KNOW.

00:58:35.812 --> 00:58:37.881
THEY COULDN'T POSSIBLY BUT

00:58:37.947 --> 00:58:38.381
THAT'S IMPORTANT POINT.

00:58:38.448 --> 00:58:40.383
IT IS A MAJOR POLICY.

00:58:40.450 --> 00:58:43.486
CERTAINLY WITH MERIT BUT WE

00:58:43.553 --> 00:58:44.654
CAN'T BE DONE BLANK CHECKS.

00:58:44.721 --> 00:58:45.321
AND IF GOING TO BE AFFECTED THIS

00:58:45.388 --> 00:58:46.122
YEAR THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE SOME

00:58:46.189 --> 00:58:47.690
ACTION TAKEN.

00:58:47.757 --> 00:58:49.626
BY THE BUDGET IN THE BUDGET.

00:58:49.692 --> 00:58:51.261
AND ONE MAN ANOTHER COULD BE IN

00:58:51.327 --> 00:58:53.396
THE OVERALL BUDGET TELL FOR

00:58:53.463 --> 00:58:55.265
COULD BE IN.

00:58:55.331 --> 00:58:57.233
AND THE IMPORTANT POINT THEN IS

00:58:57.300 --> 00:58:58.868
THAT.

00:58:58.935 --> 00:59:00.570
THIS CAN'T BE JUST INTERJECTED

00:59:00.637 --> 00:59:04.107
LATER AFTER THE MAY REVISE.

00:59:04.173 --> 00:59:04.674
AND OR DONE IN A CONFERENCE

00:59:04.741 --> 00:59:05.875
COMMITTEE.

00:59:05.942 --> 00:59:07.043
BECAUSE THERE'S ALMOST NO PUBLIC

00:59:07.110 --> 00:59:09.379
INPUT.

00:59:09.445 --> 00:59:11.714
AND LITTLE KNOWLEDGE. TO THE

00:59:11.781 --> 00:59:13.249
PUBLIC OR EVEN TO THE MEMBERS.

00:59:13.316 --> 00:59:15.084
AT THAT TIME SO I WOULD ENTREAT

00:59:15.151 --> 00:59:16.753
THE ADMINISTRATION TO BE AS

00:59:16.819 --> 00:59:18.721
EXPEDITIOUS AS THEY CAN AS TO

00:59:18.788 --> 00:59:20.657
THIS YEAR'S PLAN.

00:59:20.723 --> 00:59:21.925
AND NOT JUST SAY WELL WE'RE

00:59:21.991 --> 00:59:23.259
GONNA BET ON THE COMMON WE'LL

00:59:23.326 --> 00:59:24.294
SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT YEAR

00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:26.262
THAT'S A MAJOR POLICY DID YOU

00:59:26.329 --> 00:59:27.897
PUT INTO EFFECT BUT YOU'RE NOT.

00:59:27.964 --> 00:59:31.634
HAVING ANY CONTROLS OR ABILITY

00:59:31.701 --> 00:59:32.902

ABILITY STE.

00:59:35.371 --> 00:59:37.173

00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:41.244
OF THE GOVERNOR'S INTENT IS TO

00:59:41.311 --> 00:59:42.912

REPUTATION SO I HAVE NO FEAR BUT

00:59:48.318 --> 00:59:49.285
IT'S A QUESTION THAT --

00:59:49.352 --> 00:59:51.521
SOMETIMES BECAUSE OF HOW THE

00:59:51.587 --> 00:59:52.922
BUDGET PROCESS IS UNFORTUNATELY

00:59:52.989 --> 00:59:55.925
CHANGE THERE ARE SOME PROBLEMS.

00:59:55.992 --> 00:59:57.360

ABLE TO LOOK AT IT THAT.

01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:11.708
DIFFERENT SPOTS ALONG THE WAY.

01:00:11.774 --> 01:00:12.475

DEPARTMENT HAS COMPLETED IT'S A

01:01:14.337 --> 01:01:15.638
I HATE TO SAY THIS BUT I THINK

01:01:15.705 --> 01:01:18.174
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF THE NEW

01:01:18.241 --> 01:01:19.742
ADMINISTRATION MAKING SURE THAT

SMALL IN THE SENSE OF THE

LARGESS OF CALIFORNIA RECEIVED

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:44.967
ABOUT SIX MILLION DOLLARS. TO DO

01:01:45.034 --> 01:01:46.702
AN OUTREACH CAMPAIGN TO TRY TO

01:01:46.769 --> 01:01:47.870

01:01:47.937 --> 01:01:50.106
WE EXPENDED THOSE FUNDS -- AND

01:01:50.173 --> 01:01:51.808
JUST FINISHED WITH THAT AND WHAT

01:01:51.874 --> 01:01:53.476
I'D SAY IS -- WHAT I WAS

01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:54.677
PARTICULARLY PROUD OF?

01:01:54.744 --> 01:01:56.446
IS THAT FATHERS WE TARGETED THAT

01:01:56.512 --> 01:01:58.281
GROUP -- THAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN

USING THIS PROGRAM AS MUCH AS WE

01:02:00.149 --> 01:02:02.518
WOULD LIKE. TO TRY TO GET THOSE

01:02:02.585 --> 01:02:04.087
NUMBERS UP THOSE CAME UP.

01:02:04.153 --> 01:02:05.421
WHEN IT CAME TO LATINO

01:02:05.488 --> 01:02:06.689
POPULATIONS IN AFRICAN AMERICAN

01:02:06.756 --> 01:02:08.691
POPULATIONS WE ALSO SAW THE

01:02:08.758 --> 01:02:09.792
SLIDE UP TO BECAUSE WELL THEIR?

01:02:09.859 --> 01:02:12.261
OVERALL OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS

01:02:12.328 --> 01:02:15.264
WE SENATE SEEN A 10% INCREASE IN

01:02:15.331 --> 01:02:16.899
THE UTILIZATION OF THE PROGRAM.

01:02:16.966 --> 01:02:18.868
THAT I BELIEVE IS IN PART -- THE

01:02:18.935 --> 01:02:20.103
RESULT.

01:02:20.169 --> 01:02:21.938
OF THAT OUTREACH PROGRAM -- BUT

01:02:22.004 --> 01:02:23.406

DO YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THIS

01:02:24.874 --> 01:02:25.875
PARTICULAR PROGRAM.

01:02:25.942 --> 01:02:27.443
MY DEPARTMENT IS MORE THAN HAPPY

01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:28.744
TO SHARE OKAY GREAT I'M

01:02:28.811 --> 01:02:30.446
PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT

01:02:30.513 --> 01:02:33.716
MAKING SURE THAT THOSE WHO PUT

01:02:33.783 --> 01:02:34.550
IN.

01:02:34.617 --> 01:02:35.918
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET OUT

01:02:35.985 --> 01:02:37.987
AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT EXPLICIT

01:02:38.054 --> 01:02:39.722
IN THE LAW OR IN THE PRACTICES

01:02:39.789 --> 01:02:41.324
OF DISCRIMINATORY.

01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:43.059
INTENT BUT THERE COULD BE A

01:02:43.126 --> 01:02:47.130
DISCRIMINATORY AFFECT -- SOMEONE

01:02:47.196 --> 01:02:49.165
THROUGHOUT AN OF STATISTIC TO ME

01:02:49.232 --> 01:02:51.267
THAT TO BE LIKE 40% OF LOW

01:02:51.334 --> 01:02:54.537
INCOME WORKERS PUT IN BUT DON'T

01:02:54.604 --> 01:02:57.073
40% DON'T ACTUALLY UTILIZE OF

01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:58.407
LOW INCOME WORKERS SO.

01:02:58.474 --> 01:03:00.576
THERE MAY BE AN UPTAKE OF 10%

01:03:00.643 --> 01:03:02.178
QUESTION IS WHO'S REALLY

01:03:02.245 --> 01:03:04.113
UTILIZING THAT -- AND ESPECIALLY

01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:06.549
IF YOU'RE LOW INCOME GETTING

01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:08.651
6270% OF THE MINIMUM WAGE DOES

01:03:08.718 --> 01:03:10.786
NOT ALLOW YOU. TO BE ABLE TO

01:03:10.853 --> 01:03:12.788
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS PROGRAM

01:03:12.855 --> 01:03:14.323

TO STAY WITH YOUR FAMILY TO BE

01:03:16.058 --> 01:03:19.829
ABLE TO HELP -- WITH WHATEVER A

01:03:19.896 --> 01:03:22.698
USE IS -- IS NEEDED SO THOSE ARE

01:03:22.765 --> 01:03:24.400
THE ISSUES THAT ESPECIALLY

01:03:24.467 --> 01:03:26.369
CONCERNED ME BECAUSE IF WE'RE

01:03:26.435 --> 01:03:27.670
REALLY GOING TO REACH.

01:03:27.737 --> 01:03:29.238
THOSE FAMILIES AND THOSE

01:03:29.305 --> 01:03:30.907
CHILDREN ALL WE'VE GOT TO MAKE

01:03:30.973 --> 01:03:34.877
SURE IT'S DONE IN SUCH A WAY SO

01:03:34.944 --> 01:03:35.978
FOR EXAMPLE.

01:03:36.045 --> 01:03:37.113
IF WHAT I'M THINKING IS CORRECT

01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:38.848
INSTEAD OF EXTENDING OR NOT IS

01:03:38.915 --> 01:03:41.417
INSTEAD OF BUT WE REALLY NEED TO

01:03:41.484 --> 01:03:43.452

01:03:43.519 --> 01:03:45.321
PERCENTAGE OF WAGE REPLACEMENT.

01:03:45.388 --> 01:03:47.723
AND THAT LIKE I SAID THE 6270%

01:03:47.790 --> 01:03:49.292
OF MINIMUM WAGE.

01:03:49.358 --> 01:03:53.062

01:03:53.129 --> 01:03:54.030

JUST BEEN INCALCULABLE TO

01:05:16.912 --> 01:05:17.480
WORKERS.

01:05:17.546 --> 01:05:19.181
AND EMPLOYERS THAT WE DO THINK

01:05:19.248 --> 01:05:20.583
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT.

01:05:20.650 --> 01:05:22.718
DOES IN THE END MEAN REDUCED

01:05:22.785 --> 01:05:23.653
TURNOVER IMPROVE JOB

01:05:23.719 --> 01:05:25.354
SATISFACTION AND DIRECT COST

01:05:25.421 --> 01:05:27.156
SAVINGS FOR A LOT OF EMPLOYERS

01:05:27.223 --> 01:05:28.090
OUT THERE.

01:05:28.157 --> 01:05:29.759
AND HOPEFULLY THROUGH THIS

01:05:29.825 --> 01:05:31.360
RENEWED FOCUS ON THE PROGRAM WE

01:05:31.427 --> 01:05:33.262
CAN START TAKING A REAL HARD

01:05:33.329 --> 01:05:34.230
LOOK AT HOW WE FINANCE THE

01:05:34.297 --> 01:05:35.731
PROGRAM -- ESPECIALLY FOR

01:05:35.798 --> 01:05:37.667
TALKING ABOUT MAJOR EXPANSIONS

01:05:37.733 --> 01:05:38.768
IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND

01:05:38.834 --> 01:05:39.935
THERE RIGHT NOW.

01:05:40.002 --> 01:05:41.737
THE PROGRAM IS FUNDED 1100% BY

01:05:41.804 --> 01:05:44.273
WORKER CONTRIBUTIONS AND THAT

01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:46.008
ARM WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW WE

01:05:46.075 --> 01:05:47.943
WANT TO BRING MORE BENEFITS TO

01:05:48.010 --> 01:05:49.312
WORKERS WE THINK I MAKES A LOT

01:05:49.378 --> 01:05:50.479
OF SENSE TO CONSIDER THAT.

01:05:50.546 --> 01:05:51.314
THE PROGRAM DOES DIRECTLY

01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:52.515
BENEFIT EMPLOYERS AND THERE'S A

01:05:52.581 --> 01:05:54.450
LOT THAT WE COULD DO TO MAKE US

01:05:54.517 --> 01:05:55.818
LOOK MORE LIKE OTHER STATES AND

01:05:55.885 --> 01:05:57.253
OTHER COUNTRIES THAT DO HAVE

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:57.687
MORE OF AN EMPLOYER

01:05:57.753 --> 01:05:58.621
CONTRIBUTIONS.

01:05:58.688 --> 01:05:59.989
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE

01:06:00.056 --> 01:06:02.391
CONCERNED WITH IS THAT THE D. I

01:06:02.458 --> 01:06:03.693
FUND AS IT STANDS NOW HAS BECOME.

01:06:03.759 --> 01:06:04.794
KIND OF A SAFETY NET FOR

01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:06.362
EMPLOYERS WHEN IT COMES TO

01:06:06.429 --> 01:06:07.830
THINGS LIKE WORKERS COMPENSATION

01:06:07.897 --> 01:06:08.531
WHERE.

01:06:08.597 --> 01:06:10.099
WE HAVE WORKERS WHO ARE HURT ON

01:06:10.166 --> 01:06:12.268
THE JOB OCCUPATIONAL INJURY THEY

01:06:12.335 --> 01:06:13.502
CAN'T WORK ANYMORE WHEN THEIR

01:06:13.569 --> 01:06:15.204
PLAYER FIGHTS THE CLAIM THEY

01:06:15.271 --> 01:06:16.505
HAVE TO GO ON THE DE I FIND

01:06:16.572 --> 01:06:18.874
GOING TO DE I TO ON TO STAY

01:06:18.941 --> 01:06:19.342
AFLOAT.

01:06:19.408 --> 01:06:21.210
AND AS A THE IDEA IS THAT THEN

01:06:21.277 --> 01:06:22.445
WHEN THE WORKERS CLAIMS FOUND TO

01:06:22.511 --> 01:06:23.946
BE WORK RELATED.

01:06:24.013 --> 01:06:25.247
THAT THE STATE THEN GOES BACK

01:06:25.314 --> 01:06:25.848
AND GETS THAT MONEY FROM THE

01:06:25.915 --> 01:06:27.616
EMPLOYER BUT OFTEN THAT DOESN'T

01:06:27.683 --> 01:06:29.085
HAPPEN AND AS A RESULT THERE'S

01:06:29.151 --> 01:06:31.687
WELL OVER A BILLION DOLLARS THAT.

01:06:31.754 --> 01:06:33.189
SHOULD BE IN THE FUND THAT ISN'T.

01:06:33.255 --> 01:06:33.823
THERE'S A SIMILAR ISSUE

01:06:33.889 --> 01:06:35.024
HAPPENING WITH UNEMPLOYMENT

01:06:35.091 --> 01:06:37.159
INSURANCE WHERE IF THERE IS A

01:06:37.226 --> 01:06:39.228
RECESSION AND OUR SYSTEM IS

01:06:39.295 --> 01:06:41.063
CHRONICALLY UNDERFUNDED AS IT IS.

01:06:41.130 --> 01:06:42.965
THE THE LOANS THAT WE NEED FROM

01:06:43.032 --> 01:06:44.333
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GENERATE

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:45.901
A LOT OF INTEREST AND DURING THE

01:06:45.968 --> 01:06:46.969
LAST RECESSION.

01:06:47.036 --> 01:06:47.937
THE MONEY FOR THE GENERAL FUND

01:06:48.003 --> 01:06:49.905
WASN'T THERE AND SO THAT MONEY

01:06:49.972 --> 01:06:50.840
WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE D. I. FUND.

01:06:50.906 --> 01:06:51.707
ARE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF

01:06:51.774 --> 01:06:54.410
DOLLARS THAT THEN WENT TO GO PAY

01:06:54.477 --> 01:07:00.015
OFF THE INTEREST ON THE LOANS

01:07:00.082 --> 01:07:01.617
THAT ARE THERE BECAUSE FRANKLY

01:07:01.684 --> 01:07:02.251
EMPLOYERS UNDER FUND THE U. I.

01:07:02.318 --> 01:07:02.785
SYSTEM AND SO.

01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:03.619
IT HAS BECOME SORT OF A SAFETY

01:07:03.686 --> 01:07:04.887
NET FOR EMPLOYERS THAT WE THINK

01:07:04.954 --> 01:07:06.422
IS IS IRONIC GIVEN THAT IT'S ALL

01:07:06.489 --> 01:07:07.056
WORKER FUNDED AND SO -- MUSIC

01:07:07.123 --> 01:07:07.590

01:07:07.656 --> 01:07:08.724
CONSIDER AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND

01:07:08.791 --> 01:07:09.592
WE LOOK FOR TO BEING A PART OF

01:07:09.658 --> 01:07:10.192
THE CONVERSATION.

01:07:10.259 --> 01:07:12.094
