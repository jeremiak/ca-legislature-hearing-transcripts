WELL THANK YOU- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- COMMITTEE MEMBERS- OVER THE PAST pSEVERAL MONTHS WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SAD REMINDERS ABOUT THE NEED TO INCREASE KNOWLEDGE OF NATIVE AMERICAN HISTORY AND CULTURE IN OUR SCHOOL SYSTEMS. IN OCTOBER A TEACHER OR FAKE INDIAN HEADDRESS AND HOPPED AROUND THE CLASS AND MISGUIDED EFFORT TO HELP OUR STUDENTS- REMEMBER MATH PRINCIPLES. ALSO IN OCTOBER AND THEN LATER IN NOVEMBER THE NEW YORK TIMES PUBLISHED TWO STORIES ABOUT IN FAMOUS FOUNDER OF THE HASTINGS LAW SCHOOL. THAT TALE THAT THEY TOLD IN THERE TOLD OF THE KILLING SPREE THAT THIS INDIVIDUAL PERPETRATED AGAINST THE UK- INDIAN PEOPLE AND AROUND VALLEY TRIBES TO SEIZE THEIR LAND. I AND TO CONTINUE TO GAIN WEALTH THESE TYPES OF HISTORY IS NOT BEING TAUGHT WITHIN THE SCHOOL SYSTEMS ABOUT THE TRUE HISTORY HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND ALSO IN APRIL OF FORMER PENNSYLVANIA SENATOR RICK SANTORUM WAS WIDELY CONDEMNED AND LOST HIS CNN JOB. AFTER SAYING THAT SETTLERS. BIRTH THE NATION FROM NOTHING. AND HE WAS QUOTED TO SAY I MEAN THERE WAS NOTHING HERE I MEAN YES WE HAVE NATIVE AMERICANS BUT CANDIDLY THERE ISN'T MUCH NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURE. IN AMERICAN. THE CULTURE ITSELF TODAY. THESE TYPES OF AREAS THE TYPES OF STATE CAN. TO PLAGUE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND NATION. IN THE SENSE. REFER ABOUT. AND IGNORE SIRENS. TOWARD A PEEP HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS MORE. INDIVIDUAL TRIBAL MEMBERS IN ANY OTHER STATE IN THE NATION WITH MORE THAN A HUNDRED TRIES BEING REPRESENTED WELL EACH ONE WITH ITS OWN CULTURE AND LANGUAGE. OUR STATE HAS THE GREATEST NUMBER OF NATIVE AMERICANS AND THEY ARE WIDELY DISPERSED- WITH MORE THAN IS A SIGNIFICANT POPULATION AND IT'S A NUMBER ONE POPULATION IN THE NATION OF NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE. MANY OF THE HIGHWAYS THAT WE SEE TODAY AND TRAVEL WERE ONCE INDIAN TRAILS THAT CONTINUE TO BE ROUTES FOR STATE AND HIGHWAY FIVE. ONE OH ONE AND MANY OF THOSE AREAS THAT YET IS IT BEING TOLD AND THE HISTORY BEING TOLD IN THE SCHOOLS ITSELF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON NATIVE AMERICAN AFFAIRS HELD A JOINT HEARING. WE HEARD FROM REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE STATE OF WASHINGTON IN A PARTICULAR STATE SENATOR JOHN MCCOY. WHO SAID THAT HIS STATE'S EFFORT TO TEACH A MORE COMPLETE AND ACCURATE HISTORY OF ITS TRIBES BEGAN WITH SCHOOLS REACHING OUT TO THE TRIBES WHO LIVE IN THEIR AREA. WE ALSO HEARD FROM CHAIRMAN KENNETH KAHN FROM SANTA YNEZ TRIBAL GOVERNMENT CENTER WEBER WITH THE SAMBAR DINO CITY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND MARGARET ROBBINS FROM THE KLAMATH TRINITY JOINT UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND JUDY FLORES AND CHAIRMAN JACK CARTER FROM SHASTA COUNTY. THEY SHARED EXAMPLES OF HOW TRIBES IN SCHOOLS INTERACT IN A POSITIVE CONSISTENT RELATIONSHIP BUILDING MATTER. AND THE RESULTING POSITIVE STUDENT OUTCOMES FOR ALL STUDENTS IN THE STATE OF WASHINGTON. IT CAN BE DONE AND ONE IS DONE RIGHT ALL STUDENTS AND FAMILIES BENEFIT. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE STRIVING FOR HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. JUST AS ALL CALIFORNIA STUDENTS ARE TAUGHT ABOUT ANCIENT GREEK AND ROMAN EFFORTS AT DEMOCRACY. ALL STUDENTS SHOULD ALSO BE TAUGHT ABOUT THE EARLY AND ONGOING EFFORTS OF COLONIZATION. TOWARDS CALIFORNIA'S FIRST PEOPLE. THEY SHOULD ALSO BE ABLE TO HAVE A- INTO THE TRAVEL GO STE. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT FOR STE LOW GOVERNMENTS TRY WILL GO. SOVEREIGN GO. SHOULD BE PART OF THAT EQUATION AS WELL AS THE HISTORY THE HISTORY THAT WE TALKED ABOUT- EARLY ON WITH THOSE OF THE FOUNDERS SUCH AS HASTINGS. JUST A STUDENTS LEARN ABOUT EUROPEAN ATROCITIES SUCH AS THE HOLOCAUST. ALL STUDENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD ALSO LEARN ABOUT THE GENOCIDE OF NATIVE AMERICANS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LOCAL SCHOOL TO CONNECT WITH THEIR LOCAL TRIBES BECAUSE THAT HISTORY AND CULTURE. IS NOT ALWAYS INCLUDED IN THE TEXT BOOKS IN THEIR LOCAL AREAS. BY ENCOURAGING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL LOCAL AMERICAN INDIAN TASK FORCE TO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS WITH LOCAL ALLEY ACE WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE DIALOGUE AROUND AND TO MOVE FORWARD. AB FIFTEEN FIFTY FOUR WAS MEANT TO START THATPROCESS. AND NOT MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE I WILL BE INTRODUCING A NEW PIECE OF LEGISLATION THIS YEAR AND WORKING WITH YOUR COMMITTEE TO CONTINUE TO FURTHER THAT MISSION THAT AB FIFTEEN FIFTY FOUR- STARTED WITH THAT DIALOGUE AND MOVING FORWARD WITH THE INSTRUCTION. OF CALIFORNIA'S FIRST POPLE AND WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD. BECAUSE OUR ARE WE AS A COMMITTEE OR STATE SO NAIVE TO THINK THAT OVER A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY YEARS OF MYTHOLOGY AND FALSEHOODS CAN BE OR WILL BE CORRECTED WITH ONE BILL. IT'S A LONG TERM APPROACH BUT THE BRIDGE BUT THE JOURNEY BEGINS WITH ONE STEP AND TODAY WITH THE INTENT OF THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION STARTING THE DIALOGUE AND THE INTENT TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD. SERVES AS THAT MECHANISM IN THIS THE DREAM OF THE CALIFORNIA OF CALIFORNIA'S FIRST PEOPLE WOULD BE TO SEE THE HISTORY. OF CALIFORNIA'S FIRST PEOPLE TAUGHT TO BOTH NATIVE AMERICAN AND NON NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENTS ALIKE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA INSTILLING PRIDE IN THE NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENTS AND TO FURTHER UNDERSTANDING AND THE NON NATIVE KIDS ABOUT THE TRUE AND FACTUAL HISTORY. GOOD AND BAD HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE ORIGINALLY HAD TESTIMONY FROM C. T. A REPRESENTATIVE MERRY LEVI. AND CHAIRMAN GREG SARRIS. IN THOSE TESTIMONIES THAT WE'RE LOOKING HERE TODAY- CHAIRMAN GREG SARRIS TESTIMONY WILL BE PRESENTED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER EDUARDO GARCIA TO READ THAT AND TO THE HISTORY AND INTO THE TESTIMONY. THANK YOU PERHAPS A MEMBER RAMOS- MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT- DID NOT ALLOW FOR TESTIMONY TO BE DONE- VIRTUALLY. WAS TAPPED UP BY CHAIRMAN GREG SARS OF FEDERATED INDIANS OF GRATON RANCHERIA TO READ HIS STATEMENT. AND READ THIS FOLLOWS GROWING UP IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA I WAS TAUGHT THE USUAL RHETORIC IN MIDDLE SCHOOL ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN EXPERIENCE. WE BUILT MISSIONS OUT OF SUGAR CUBES AND POPSICLE STICKS AND UNDERSTOOD THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLES ACCORDING TO WHITEWASH HISTORY PROPAGATED BY POPULAR CULTURE AND THE CHAPTER TWO IN MIDDLE SCHOOL TEXTBOOKS. THAT WAS FIFTY PLUS YEARS AGO THE CURRENT INSTRUCTIONAL CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN SOCIAL SCIENCE STANDARDS AND FRAMEWORKS HAVE AN IMPROVEMENT SINCE. AND DO NOT TELL HE TO NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE STORY. WHEN I WAS A GRADUATE STUDENT AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR ASKED ME. WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE I'VE NEVER SEEN PEOPLE LIKE BEES. HE WAS REFERRING TO THE CHARACTERS IN THE STORY THAT WOULD BECOME A NOVEL ENTITLED GRAND AVENUE ABOUT A FAMILY OF CALIFORNIA INDIANS. EVEN IN AN URBAN NEIGHBORHOOD. LATER WHILE WORKING ON SCREEN PLAY FOR AN H. B. O. MINI SERIES OF THE SAME NAME. A MENTOR AT SUNDANCE COMMENTED. I DON'T KNOW AFRICAN AMERICANS AND INDIANS INTERACTIVE. AS CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE IT IS TIME TO TEACH THE REAL HISTORY OF CALIFORNIANS OF AMERICANS. THE PROPOSED CALIFORNIA. INDIAN EDUCATION ACT WOULD REQUIRE AND PROVIDE SOCIAL STUDIES CURRICULUM FOR GRADES THREE FOUR EIGHT AND ELEVEN. ABOUT CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN HISTORY AND CULTURE WE MUST SUPPORT THIS BILL. GRANTED MUCH OF THE HISTORY IS DIFFICULT THE NEARLY ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND ROLLED MEMBERS OF MY TRIBE FEDERATED INDIANS OF GRATON RANCHERIA DESCEND FROM FOURTEEN SURVIVORS OF A COMBINED COASTAL TRIED ME WALK AND SOUTHERN FORMAL PRE EUROPEAN CONTACT POPULATION. APPROXIMATELY TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE. THE HORRORS OF EUROPEAN DISEASE FOR WHICH WE HAD NO IMMUNITY AND SLAVERY UNDER THE SPANISH MEXICAN. AND AMERICAN PERIODS TOOK ITS TOLL. THIS HISTORY SHOULD NOT BE TAUGHT TO SHAME BUT THE HEEL AND TO LEARN. TO LEARN IN AN INCREASINGLY DIVERSE WORLD WAYS NOT TO REPEAT THE PAST BUT TO NEGOTIATE A POSITIVE BREAK RELATIONSHIP WITH PEOPLE DIFFERENT FROM OURSELVES. CALIFORNIA INDIAN EDUCATION ACT IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR OUR STATE AS A LEADER IN NATIVE AMERICAN ISSUES. THERE ARE ALWAYS HAS BEEN AND STILL IS A LARGER INDIGENOUS POPULATION THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE COUNTRY. THERE ARE HUNDRED FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES AND OKAY LOS ANGELES ARE HOME TO THE COUNTY'S LARGEST URBAN INDIAN POPULATIONS SEEMS TO KNOW WE ARE HERE. AS ILIKE TO SAY UNTIL THERE WERE CASINOS NO ONE KNEW WE SURVIVED THE MISSIONS. CALIFORNIANS CAN CHANGE THAT. PLEASE SUPPORT THIS BILL. ACTUALLY ASK FOR RIVAL. THANK THANK YOU THANK YOU MR GARCIA DID YOU HAVE ANOTHER WITNESS YEAH SO- WE ALSO HAVE- REPRESENTING CTA MERRY LEVI- TESTIMONY HERE IN PERSON TO BE READ BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER SHARON QUIRK SILVA. OKAY AND THAT OULD TAKE CARE OF OUR TO WITNESS YOU COME UP TO THE TABLE BY THE WAY I MEAN. JUST YEAH. HELLO HEARING SYSTEM. HELLO CHAIRMAN O'DONNELL AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF MERRY LEVI AND I AM HONORED TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK BEFORE YOU ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION CTA WE APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD ON THE CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN CURRICULUM AND STUDENT ACCESS. MERRY CURRENTLY SERVES AS THE CHAIR OF CTAS AMERICAN INDIAN ALASKA NATIVE CAUCUS AND IS AN ELECTIVE REPRESENTATIVE TO CTAS POLICY MAKING STATE COUNCIL OF EDUCATION. CTA'S ORGANIZATIONAL POLICY STRONGLY SUPPORTS OF TEACHING STUDENTS ABOUT THEIR ANCESTRAL LEGACIES IN THE CULTURE OF ARE CALIFORNIA NATIVES PEOPLE. WE FEEL THAT THIS IS A CENTRAL IN THE STRUGGLE FOR RACIAL RACIAL JUSTICE AND EQUITY. CTA SUPPORTS PROMOTING GENUINE RESPECT FOR INDIVIDUAL AND CULTURAL DIVERSITY BY PROVIDING STUDENTS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A WELL ROUNDED EDUCATION THAT INCLUDES NATIVE AMERICAN CURRICULUM TO BETTER UNDERSTAND OUR NATIVE PEOPLE CULTURAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE SHOWN THIS THROUGH THE SUPPORT OF OUR BILLS ASSEMBLY. MEMBER LOANS BILL SEVEN THIRTY EIGHT WHICH CALLED FOR A MODEL CURRICULUM FOR NATIVE AMERICAN STUDIES BUT WAS NOT FUNDED AND AB ONE SIXTY THREE WILLIAMS IN TWENTY FIFTEEN TO ALLOW AUTHORIZED ELDERS TO RECEIVE A TEACHING CREDENTIAL TO TEACH THEIR NATIVE LANGUAGE AND CULTURE. AND AB NINE FORTY FIVE RAMOS ALLOWING NATIVE STUDENTS TO WEAR THEIR TRIBAL REGALIA DURING THEIR HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION. MOST RECENTLY WE FOUGHT FOR ETHNIC STUDIES INCLUDING NATIVE AMERICAN CURRICULUM WHICH ENHANCES STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND IS A CENTRAL COMPONENT OF A CULTURALLY DIVERSE EDUCATION. HOWEVER EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE PROVIDED SUPPORT WE CONTINUE TO FIND. NEEDING TO HAVE ACCESS TO ACCURATE INFORMATION AND CURRICULUM TO RESENT TO THEIR STUDENTS THESE ARE SMALL STEPS TO ACHIEVING A LARGER GOAL. TEACHERS FACE MANY CHALLENGES IN FINDING ADEQUATE CURRICULUM RESOURCES ON THIS ISSUE FOR ELEMENTARY GRADES WE NEED TO TEACH ABOUT OUR LOCAL NATIVE COMMUNITIES. BUT THERE IS QUITE A LONG LETTER SO I'M GOING TO KIND OF WRAP UP BUT I THINK. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS THE CENTRAL AS WE KNOW US FELLOW EDUCATORS IS MAKING SURE THAT CURRICULUM IS NOT ONLY ACCURATE IT'S FACTUAL AND THAT OUR STUDENTS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY NEED TO RECEIVE THAT AND THIS IS ON BEHALF OF. MERRY SORRY LEAVE A- WHERE THIRTY MERRY FROM CTA GOT IT THANK YOU THANK YOU BOTH FOR THE PRESENTATION I WILL NOT GO TO THE PUBLIC SO IF YOU'RE A MANTA MEMBER THE PUBLIC AND YOU WISH TO SUPPORT THIS BILL SUPPORT THIS EFFORT WELL YOU CAN USUALLY WALK UP TO THE MICROPHONE STATE YOUR NAME IF YOU'RE AFFILIATED WITH ANY ORGANIZATION SAY THAT AND WHETHER AND THAT YOU'RE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IT'S NOT A TIME FOR FURTHER TESTIMONY IT'S JUST TIME TO KIND OF SAY HERE'S WHO I AM.

CLEARING HOUSE IF YOU WILL- WHERE WE CAN HAVE THAT INFORMATION- ACCESSIBLE TO TEACHERS. RIGHT SO THEY CAN SHARE THE STORY IN A MORE ACCURATE WAY.

THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENTS- SO MEMBER BENNETT AND THE COMMITTEE. THIS IS A MAN- AB FIFTY FIFTY FOUR IS A MEANT TO MOVE FOR WITH THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE TO START TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES.

I BELIEVE THIS RACE IS PRESENTING PERMITS FRIEDMAN MISS FRIEDMAN IS NOT WITH US TODAY I'M- SIR YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READING. HERE ARE THE NUMBERS I RISE TO PRESENT AB FOUR FIFTY TWO ON BEHALF OF OUR COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN WHO WANTS TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR YOUR COMMITTEE STUFF FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL ESPECIALLY OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS. AB FOUR FIFTY TWO WILL REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. IN CONSULTATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO DEVELOP AN UPDATE AS NECESSARY A NOTIFICATION. REGARDING SAFE FIREARM STORAGE THAT WILL BE ANNUALLY. PROVIDED TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION AND CHARTER SCHOOLS FOR DISTRIBUTION. SPECIFICALLY THIS NOTIFICATION WILL INFORM PARENTS AND GUARDIANS OF THE CALIFORNIA. CHILD ACCESS PREVENTION LAWS AND LAWS RELATING TO THE SAFE STORAGE OF FIREARMS. AWARENESS OF THESE LAWS HELPS TO PREVENT TRAGEDIES DUE TO UNINTENTIONAL DISCHARGES SUICIDES AND GUN THEFTS BY CRITICS CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT HELPING TO ENSURE FIREARMS ARE ONLY USED BY THEIR RIGHTFUL OWNER. NEW DATA RELEASED BY THE CDC SHOWS THAT FIREARMS WERE THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR CHILDREN AND TEENS IN AMERICA IN TWENTY TWENTY. EVERY YEAR EIGHTEEN THOUSAND CHILDREN AND TEENS ARE SHOT AND KILLED OR WOUNDED AND APPROXIMATELY THREE MILLION ARE EXPOSED TO GUN VIOLENCE. UNFORTUNATELY THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS ONLY EXACERBATED THIS PROBLEM IT IS TIME TO ENSURE FIREARMS ARE SAFELY STORED AWAY FROM CHILDREN TEENS AS REQUIRED BY LAW. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT THIS AFTERNOON OUR REBEKAH MARCUS FROM BRADY AGAINST GUN VIOLENCE AND EMILY SCHWARTZ FROM. WOMEN AGAINST GUN VIOLENCE. HELLO YOU COME TO THE TABLE UP HERE. I TESTIFIED AND THEN WHEN YOUR DONE THE NEXT WITNESS IN SUPPORT MAY COME UP. THANK YOU TWO MINUTES MAX PLEASE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON SHARON MEMBERS REBEKAH MARCUS REPRESENTING THE BRADY CAMPAIGN BRADY HAS BEEN A LONG TIME ADVOCATE FOR SAFE STORAGE ACCESS PREVENTION LAWS THESE LAWS PROMOTE RESPONSIBLE GUN OWNING PRACTICES BY REQUIRING GUN OWNERS TO KEEP THEIR FIREARMS OUT OF THE REACH OF OTHERS. WHO COULD USE THE WEAPON TO DEADLY EFFECT THESE LAWS PREVENT FAMILY FIRE A SHOOTING INVOLVING AND PROPERLY STORED OR MISUSED GUN FOUND IN THE HOME RESULTING IN INJURY OR DEATH CALIFORNIA ALSO HAS THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE STANDARDS FOR SAFETY DEVICES. AND PROHIBITS ANY PERSON FROM COMMERCIALLY SELLING ANY FIREARM SAFETY DEVICE THAT IS NOT LISTED ON THE STATE'S ROSTER THESE LAWS SAVE LIVES PREVENT TRAGEDIES DUE TO UNINTENTIONAL DISCHARGES SUICIDE AND GUN THEFT BY ENSURING THAT FIREARMS CAN ONLY BE ACCESSED AND USED BY THEIR RIGHTFUL OWNERS. PASSING COMPREHENSIVE STANDARDS FOR SAFETY DEVICES AND STORAGE IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT HOWEVER WERE MISSING A CRUCIAL STEP WHEN WE DON'T TAKE THE TIME TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC AND IN PARTICULAR PARENTS ABOUT THESE LIFESAVING LOS PROXIMITY TO UNSECURED FIREARMS HAS PLAYED A KEY ROLE DURING THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC MARKETS WERE GENERALLY BEING KEPT HOME. AND DURING A PERIOD OF RECORD NEW GUN OWNERSHIP THE NUMBER OF UNINTENTIONAL SHOOTINGS INVOLVING CHILDREN ROSE BY THIRTY ONE PERCENT. OVER 75% OF SCHOOL SHOOTINGS ARE FACILITATED BY KIDS WHO HAVE ACCESS TO UNSECURED AND OR UNSUPERVISED GUNS AT HOME KEEPING GUNS LOCKED AND UNLOADED REDUCES THE RISK OF DEATH FROM UNINTENTIONAL SHOOTINGS AND SUICIDE. AMONG YOUTH BY 73% WHICH IS CRITICAL BECAUSE 70% OF CHILDREN AND UN OWNING A HOUSE HOUSEHOLDS KNOW WHERE THE FIRE ARMS ARE CAPPED SADLY OVER 80% OF TEENS WHO COMMIT SUICIDE WITH THE GUN USED ONE THAT BELONG TO SOMEONE IN THEIR HOME. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT SAFETY SAFELY STORING FIREARMS BECOMES THE CULTURAL NORM LIKE PUTTING ON A SEATBELT AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE CAN DO IS TO EDUCATE PEOPLE FROM ALL THAT FOR ALL THESE REASONS WE URGE AND I ABOUT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THE NEXT WITNESS ME ONE MOMENT I'M SORRY.

INCIDENTS AT SCHOOLS WERE TAKEN FROM THE HOME OF. OR RELATIVE. AND THIRTY NINE PER OF PARA WRONG BELIEVE CHILDREN DON'T KNOW WHERE THE GUN IS STILL. AN ESTIMATED OF FOUR PER SIX. A CHILDREN LIVING HOME AT LEAST ONE GUN IS. LOADED AND I'M- I HAVE A FRIEND WHO ATTENDS AUGUST HIGH SCHOOL. HE WATCHES CLASS MIGHT TAKE THEIR FINAL BREATHS ON THE DAY OF THE SHOOTING. I'VE SEEN THE TRAUMA THAT HAS FORMED SINCE THAT DAY. I WITNESSED FRIENDS FALL INTO PANIC FROM THE NOISE OF A HELICOPTER I'VE SEEN THEM FRIED AND FROM THE SOUND OF AN ALARM. I WATCHED THE CHILD INSIDE THEM DISAPPEAR. WE NEED MEANINGFUL MULTIFACETED ACTION TO KEEP OUR SCHOOLS SAFE ACTIONS THAT ADDRESS WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT SCHOOL SHOOTINGS. WE NEED ACTION THAT WILL PREVENT SHOOTINGS FROM OCCURRING IN THE FIRST PLACE. CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAS SOME OF THE STRONGEST SAFE GUN STORAGE AND CHILD ACCESS PREVENTION LAWS IN THE COUNTRY.

OKAY OKAY I WILL GO TO A FILE NUMBER SIX AB EIGHT FIVE FIVE EIGHT FIVE NINE OR SIX. WELL. GOOD AFTERNOON. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU WHEN I SHOULD START. FIVE CORRECT. THANK YOU FIRST AND FOREMOST THE SEARCHER THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS BILL IN THIS COMMITTEE AND I ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE WONDERFUL WORK OF YOUR STAFF VERY MUCH APPRECIATE HOW DILIGENTLY THEY'VE BEEN WORKING WITH ME OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST YEAR YEAR AND A HALF IN ORDER TO BRING THIS BILL TO THE TO THE TO WHERE IT IS TODAY. IN GENERAL OVERVIEW AB FIVE FIVE EIGHT PROVIDES REIMBURSEMENTS AND GRANT MONEY TO SCHOOLS TO INCENTIVIZE THE ADOPTION OF PLANT BASED VEGETARIAN AND RESTRICTED. DIET MEALS AND PLANT BASED MILK OPTIONS. ALSO IT WILL REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS. ON HOW TO SERVE ELIGIBLE YOUNGER SIBLINGS. A FEDERALLY REIMBURSABLE MEAL. AT A SCHOOL SITE. THAT THEIR SIBLINGS ATTENDS THAT THEIR SIBLING ATTENDS. WE HAVE TAKEN SEVERAL AMENDMENTS IN ORDER TO MAKE THE BILL AS INCLUSIVE AS POSSIBLE OF THOSE WITH SPECIAL DIETARY NEEDS WITHOUT SACRIFICING. THE CORE GOALS OF THE BILL. WITHIN OUR AMENDMENTS WE HAVE ADDED. TO OTHER DIED OPTIONS RESTRICTED FOOD OPTIONS WHICH ARE- BASICALLY KOSHER HALAL WHICH IS INCLUSIVE OF ALL TYPES OF MEAT AS WELL- INVADES AND VEGETARIAN FOOD OPTION. AT THIS AT ITS CORE THE BILL SEEKS TO BE A PART OF THE SOLUTION FOR TWO CRITICAL ISSUES. REDUCING EMISSIONS AND IMPROVING CHILDHOOD NUTRITION. A PILOT ANALYSIS OF OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT CONDUCTED BY FRIENDS OF THE EARTH DOCUMENTED A 14% REDUCTION IN CARBON EMISSIONS AND A 6% REDUCTION IN WATER USE. AS A RESULT OF IMPLEMENTING THE GOALS OF THIS BILL. PLANT BASED FOODS HAVE SIGNIFICANT HEALTH BENEFITS AS WELL THESE INCLUDE REDUCING THE RISK OF DIABETES CANCER AND HELPING TO MAINTAIN A HEALTHY WEIGHT. BY GIVING KIDS THE OPTION OF HEALTHIER DIVERSE MEAL OPTIONS WE ARE HELPING THEIR DEVELOPMENT AT AN EARLY AGE. SIMILARLY BY ASSISTING LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES TO REACH ELIGIBLE NON SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN TO RECEIVE FREE OR REDUCED PRICE BREAKFAST. THE BILL WILL GIVE OPPORTUNITY TO MANY KIDS TO RECEIVE MAILS THEY OTHERWISE WOULDN'T HAVE. WITH THAT IN MIND THIS BILL WILL TAP INTO THE REACH AND EXPERTISE OF CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND REQUIRED THAT IT ISSUE INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN PROBABLY PROPERLY. ADDRESS THE HUNGER NEEDS OF YOUNGER CHILDREN WHO ARE NOT YET OF SCHOOL AGE SO THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO FOOD SPECIFICALLY BREAKFAST TO GUARANTEE THAT THEY ARE FOR THE MOST IMPORTANT MEAL OF THE DAY. DOING SO IS CRITICAL FOR THE HEALTH OFSO MANY KIDS IN THE SHORT TERM A CHILD EXPERIENCING HUNGER IS LESS LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS IN SCHOOL TO AVERT SCHOOL DISCIPLINARY ACTION OR TO PARTICIPATE IN EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES. IN THE LONG TERM CHILDHOOD HUNGER INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE CHILD WILL EXPERIENCE DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS COGNITIVE DEFICIENCIES AND ADULT AUTO IMMUNE DISEASES THAT ARE BOTH COSTLY AND PAINFUL AND COLLEAGUES LET'S REMIND OURSELVES COSTLY AT THE STATE LEVEL STATE EXPENSE. ALL OF THOSE COSTS ARE THEN ENCOURAGED BY OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS AND MEDIC CAL ABSORBS IT. THE OPPOSITION HAS ARGUED THAT- WE SHOULD FOCUS ON FEEDING AS MANY KIDS AS POSSIBLE RATHER THAN DICTATING WHAT THEY EAT. BUT THIS BILL DOES EXACTLY THAT AND IT EXPANDS ACCESS TO MEALS FOR KIDS BY REQUIRING THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS. ON SERVING ELIGIBLE YOUNGER SIBLINGS OF FEDERALLY REIMBURSABLE MEAL AT A SCHOOL SIDE THAT THEIR SIBLING ATTENDS MORE KIDS WILL NOW BE RECEIVING MEALS. MORE IMPORTANTLY WE ARE ALREADY TACKLING THIS PROBLEM OF ACCESS WITH SENATOR SKINNER'S UNIVERSAL MEAL DEAL WHICH ADEQUATELY ADDRESSES THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERN THIS BILL GOES HAND IN HAND WITH SENATOR SKINNER'S BY FOCUSING. ON IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF FOOD WE FEED OUR CHILDREN- THANK YOU COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I VOTE FOR THE CHILD NUTRITION ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND TODAY WITH ME IS OUR WITNESSES ARE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AND- HERBIE WHO REPRESENTS OUR BILL SPONSORED PHYSICIAN COMMITTEE FOR RESPONSIBLE MEDICINE.

ON BEHALF OF THE PHYSICIANS COMMITTEE FOR RESPONSIBLE MEDICINE THE NATIONAL NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION WITH OVER TWELVE THOUSAND MEMBERS IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY O TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB FIVE FIFTY EIGHT. MY NAME IS DOCTOR AND HERBIE AND I'M A PHYSICIAN COMMITTEES NUTRITION EDUCATION PROGRAM MANAGER BASED IN WILLITS CALIFORNIA. I'M A REGISTERED DIETITIAN. AND CERTIFIED DIABETES EDUCATOR WITH A DOCTORATE IN HEALTH SCIENCES. THE PHYSICIANS COMMITTEE SUPPORTS THE CHILD NUTRITION ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THIS LEGISLATION WILL INCENTIVIZE EXPAND ACCESS TO PLANT BASED% MEALS AND MILK OPTIONS IN CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN DOING SO THIS BILL WHEN WILL INVEST IN THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN TODAY AND DRAMATICALLY REDUCE HEALTHCARE COSTS WELL INTO THE FUTURE. THERE'S A CLEAR PUBLIC HEALTH CONSENSUS ON THE NEED TO REDUCE THE CONSUMPTION OF ANIMAL PRODUCTS IN FAVOR OF MORE PLANT BASED FOOD. PLANT PLANT BASED DIETS HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO PREVENT AND REVERSE HEART DISEASE AND IMPROVE CHOLESTEROL. THEY CAN ALSO PREVENT AND REVERSE TYPE TWO DIABETES OBESITY AND HYPERTENSION WHICH ARE ALL CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO SEVERE COPD CASES. FOR STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS HEALTHY PLANT BASED MEALS CAN PROVIDE THE NUTRITIOUS DIET THAT WILL HELP THEM THROUGHOUT THE SCHOOL DAY. THE CDC CITES EVIDENCE SHOWING THAT STUDENTS WHOSE DIET LACKS IMPORTANT NUTRIENTS LIKE THOSE FOUND IN PLANT BASED MEALS. HAVE LOWER GRADES AND HIGHER RATES OF ABSENTEEISM AND TARDINESS. ON A LARGER SCALE UNHEALTHY DIETS ALSO PLACE AN UNDUE BURDEN ON HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS DIET AND LIFESTYLE RELATED DISEASES. NOW ACCOUNT FOR SEVEN IN TEN U. S. DEATHS. NINETY PERCENT. OF OUR NATION'S INTERNAL THREE POINT FIVE TRILLION DOLLAR HEALTHCARE EXPENSES ARE FOR PEOPLE WITH AT LEAST ONE CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITION. IT'S TIME TO TURN THIS TREND AROUND BY EXPANDING ACCESS TO HEALTHY PLANT BASED MEALS. IN CONCLUSION. THE PHYSICIANS COMMITTEE FOR RESPONSIBLE MEDICINE URGES THIS COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT AND ADVANCE AB FIVE FIFTY EIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY AND FOR THE COMMITTEE'S ATTENTION TO THIS VITAL ISSUE. THANK YOU. ONE SECOND HERE FOR OUR NEXT WITNESS ON. SHARE MY. AUTHORS OF THE COMPASSION HONESTLY- YEAH FIVE HUNDRED AND MILLION SCHOOL LUNCHES EACH YEAR THE POLICIES THAT THE STATE IMPLEMENTS AROUND WHAT FOODS ARE C. HEALTH BUT ALSO UNLESS OBVIOUSLY AND EQUALLY ENORMOUS IMPACT ON OUR ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE CHANGE. BY CREATING INCENTIVES FOR SCHOOLS TO REDUCE THE CARBON FOOTPRINT OF HALF A BILLION MEALS. WE WILL SEE A MASSIVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT IN OUR STATE'S FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE. WHAT TOTAL FOOD PRODUCTION ACCOUNTS 425% OF THE WORLD. GHG EMISSIONS. MEAT AND DAIRY SPECIFICALLY ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY FOURTEEN POINT 5% ACCORDING TO THE U. N.'S FOOD AND AG ORGANIZATION. ANIMAL PRODUCTS PRODUCED MULTIPLE TIMES MORE GHG EMISSIONS PER KILOGRAM OF FOOD COMPARED TO FRUITS AND VEGETABLES WITH THE WORST OFFENDER BEEF EMITTING UP TO SIXTY TIMES MORE. AND EVEN CHEESE PRODUCING UP TO TWENTY ONE TIMES MORE GHGS. AS WE SHOULD ALL BE AWARE BY NOW THE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE I. P. C. C. REPORT ON THE CLIMATE HAS BEEN DESCRIBED. BY THE U. N. SECRETARY GENERAL AS A CODE RED FOR HUMANITY. IF THE WORLD IS TO MEET ITS TARGET OF LIMITING GLOBAL WARMING TO WELL BELOW TWO DEGREES CELSIUS. A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT AWAY FROM MEAT DAIRY IS NECESSARY. YET DESPITE THESE FACTS ARE FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS CONTINUE TO INCENTIVIZE MEAT DAIRY PRODUCTS IN OUR SCHOOLS WITH SUBSIDIES AND FINANCIAL HANDOUTS TO THE SAME INDUSTRY THAT IS INCREASING OUR HEALTH THE HEALTH CARE COST. AND ENVIRONMENTAL DESTRUCTION. AB FIVE FIVE EIGHT IT'S A SMALL STEP TO MITIGATE THE ANTIQUATED HARMFUL BUT ENTRENCHED POLICIES WHICH PRIORITIZE THE ANIMAL AG INDUSTRY OVER THE HEALTH OF BOTH OUR CHILDREN. AND OUR PLANET. ON BEHALF OF SOCIAL COMPASSION THOUSANDS OF SUPPORTERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL- CHARGES OR ANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL OTHERS IN THE ROOM SUPPORT. SIX OTHERS. ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT. GREAT- YOU SEE NO THERE'S A SUPPORT ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL- SEEING OPPOSITION THE BILL WILL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE- MISS CORK SILVA. OUR FIRST IS FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND ASKED TO BE A JOINT AUTHOR WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS BILL LIFE I FEEL THAT IT'S- NOT ONLY A PRIORITY BUT IT WILL MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IRAN A COMPANION BILL A HANDFUL YEARS YEAR AGO DURING CURRY'S SCHOOL pDISTRICTS TO START TO POKE AGAIN BECAUSE ONE OF OUR FACTORS THAT WE KNOW WHAT SCHOOL NUTRITION IS MANY OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS MOVE FROM COOKING TO PROCESSED FOOD. AND AS WE LOOK AT A REALLY STARK NUMBERS PARTICULARLY FOR LATINO COMMUNITY WHAT THEY'LL BE CITY AND DIABETES THIS IS A HUGE IMPACT I WORKED IN A SCHOOL ALMOST TWENTY YEARS AGO WHERE WE- JUST TRIED TO EVEN ENCOURAGING MALE VERSUS CHOCOLATE MILK AND THAT WAS A BIG ISSUE SO US NOW TALKING OF PLANT BASED- IS NOT JUST A TREND AS YOU KNOW IT IS A TREND BUT IT'S REALLY ABOUT AS WAS MENTIONED NOT ONLY CLIMATE BUT REALLY BETTER OUTCOMES STARTING AT A YOUNGER AGE FOR OUR STUDENTS AND EVENTUALLY. ARE ADULTS AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK SO MUCH AND YOU A JOIN AUTHORS THANK YOU. SOMETIMES WE FORGET ABOUT IT WITH THAT- MR CHOI. THANK YOU CHAIRPERSON AND- ASSEMBLY MEMBER UNDESERVEDLY AND- ICAN UNDERSTAND YOUR INTENT OF THE BILL TO- STOP OR REDUCE ARE NOW HUNGRY CHILDREN- ON UNDER SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN INTENT IS GOOD BUT UP I. WONDER WHETHER THIS IS SO RIGHT APPROACH WAR UNDER THE- VEHICLE IS SO NEEDED THE FOR THAT PURPOSE. AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND THAT EVEN OUR STATE ALONE. HAS SO NOT IT. FRESH ARE CALFRESH PROGRAM FOR INDIGENT PEOPLE OUGHT TO STOP BY THE FAMILY'S HUNGER. IN ADDITION TO- FEDERAL SCHOOL WATER METER PROGRAMS. AND I WONDER. WITH THAT YOU HAVE DONE THE STUDY THERE ARE TRULY- UNTIL SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN GO HUNGRY- IF CHAU. I WONDER WHETHER THIS SYSTEM OUR BEST APPROACH UNLESS SUPPOSED TO SO THAT MEANS SO. THE PARENT COULD GO HUNGRY AS WELL. R. ADULT A MOTHER CAN COOK FOR HERSELF AND NOT TO FEED THE CHILD AND THAT THE MOTHER. OR FATHER HAS TO DRIVE THE CHILD. ONE YOU ALL OVER TO THE SUPPOSED TO FOR YOU FOR YOUR TIME THE BEFORE KINDERGARTEN TO FLEE THE CHART TO FREE THE CHILD AT SCHOOL. TO ME THIS IS A VERY IMPRACTICAL WAY. RATHER THAN STRENGTHENING AND MAKING SURE EXISTING PROGRAMS TO BE. IMPROVED OR ENHANCED SUCH AS A KIND OF FRESH WAR VETERAN- IT PROGRAM SO. RESPOND CAN YOU CAN YOU REPLY I'M HAPPY TO DOCTOR CHOI AND I WANT TO REPLY TO YOU AND MULTIPLE VOICES. ONE AS A FELLOW IMMIGRANT AS WELL BUT I'LL WAIT FOR THAT ONE FIRST TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION ABOUT STUDIES ABOUT. MALNUTRITION OR LACK OF UP OF FOOD OPPORTUNITIES AND FOOD AND SECURITY I DON'T I THINK THIS IS A COMMITTEE THAT HERE'S THIS ISSUE. MAYBE AD NAUSEAM. YOU HEAR ABOUT THE CHALLENGES AND THE NEEDS. OVER SUFFERING FROM EITHER LACK OF FOOD OR LACK OF ENOUGH FOOD ACCESS TO FOOD AND SECURITY IS AND I THINK I'M DOWNPLAYING BY SAYING ONLY FORTY PERCENT. SO IT'S A SIGNIFICANT NEED THAT WE HAVE AND I WELCOME YOU SIR TO COME TO MY DISTRICT ANY DAY. SO THAT I CAN TAKE YOU AROUND ON A DAY WHEN. IT WAS- ON ON ANY DAY OF THE SCHOOL DAY. WHERE SCHOOL WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN SESSION BUT BECAUSE OF A LOCAL FIRE OR BECAUSE OF SOME CIRCUMSTANCE ALL SCHOOLS IN THE AREA WERE SHUT DOWN. I WELCOME YOU TO SEE THE LINES. THAT CONGREGATE OUTSIDE OF EACH OF MY SCHOOLS. I DRIVE AROUND IN THE MORNINGS I LOOK FOR THESE THINGS I SEE IT- THERE ARE LONG LINES BOTH INDIVIDUALS STANDING AS WELL AS PEOPLE IN THEIR CARS WAITING TO PICK UP THAT THESE MEALS FOR THEIR KIDS. AND I REPRESENT A RELATIVELY AFFLUENT COMMUNITY BY THE WAY. I COULD I REPRESENT THE COMMUNITIES OF TO LOOK A LAKE SHERMAN OAKS. VIDEO CITY VALLEY VILLAGE I AND YOU CAN JUST SEE IF THERE'S NEEDS IN COMMUNITIES LIKE THIS WHERE THERE'S AFFLUENCE. WHAT THE NEW LOOK WHAT THE NEED IS AND OTHER AREAS OF THE STATE THAT DON'T HAVE THESE AFFLUENT COMMUNITIES SO THAT'S ONE. THERE'S A GREAT NEED IT'S WELL DOCUMENTED IT'S AND MANY OF YOUR- DISCUSSION ITEMS THAT YOU HAVE ON IT ON A VERY REGULAR BASIS TO. YOU KNOW I DON'T. WHILE I WELL WE AL BENEFIT FROM MANY EXPERTS COMING AND SPEAKING TO US ABOUT BILL IDEAS AND DIFFERENT NEEDS THAT ARE THERE ARE ASIDE FROM OUR ASSESSMENT OF WHAT THE NEEDS ARE BASED ON MY OWN PERSONAL VIEW OF WHAT I SAW THE NEEDS TO BE. I'VE HAD A BENEFIT GROWING UP IN AN IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY FAMILY MY MOTHER WOULD. ALWAYS MAKE IT A PRIORITY TO MAKE HOME COOKED MEALS AND I HAD THE BENEFIT OF GROWING UP. HAVING A BALANCED DIET BETWEEN SOME ITEMS OF YOU KNOW A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MEAT A LOT OF DIFFERENT VEGETABLES AND A LOT OF FRUITS. I DON'T SEE THAT UNFORTUNATELY THAT BALANCE IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. I DON'T I AND NOW RAISING MY OWN THREE KIDS I DON'T SEE MY WIFE AND I HAVING THE LUXURY OF TIME TO PREPARE MEALS EVERY TIME AND SO WE NEED TO RELY ON. MEALS FROM EITHER PURCHASING THEM FROM OUTSIDE AND SO SOMETIMES IT GOES AGAINST THE BALANCE THAT WE WANT TO HALF ESPECIALLY IF WE WANT TO MAKE IT AT A PRICE POINT THAT'S AFFORDABLE. SO THERE'S MULTIPLE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT I'M TRYING TO ADDRESS HERE WITH THIS ONE BILL. GATES IT GOES TO THE FACT THAT MANY PARENTS ARE. STRUGGLING IT GOES TO THE POINT OF FOOD ALSO BEING COSTLY ESPECIALLY WITH THE INFLATION THAT WE'RE GONNA BE DEALING WITH OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT POTENTIAL FEW YEARS. AND GIVEN ALSO HOW TO WHAT EXTENT WE SEE HEALTH LONG TERM HEALTH IMPACTS AND CONSEQUENCES BEING ASSOCIATED WITH WHAT OUR CHILDREN EAT AT A YOUNG AGE IT'S CRITICAL. IT'S CRITICAL AND SO THAT'S WHY I THINK THIS IS A VERY MODEST APPROACH. AT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ALSO THE BREAKFAST PROGRAM FOR TOP FOUR FOUR SIBLINGS THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WAS ESTABLISHED. UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION BY THE WAY JUST SO YOU KNOW SIR. SO THIS IS SUCH A VERY MODEST APPROACH OF TRYING TO ADDRESS MULTIPLE DIFFERENT FACETS OF THIS ISSUE THAT YOU'RE DRESSING. SO I DO HOPE THAT YOU CONSIDER SUPPORTING THIS OKAY THANK YOU FOR EXPLANATION I EIGHT- TONE DISPUTE. THAT- IN AMERICA THERE SHOULD BE A NORMAL PERSON IT'S A CHILD OR DOG TO SHOULD CALL HUNGRY SO OF AFFLUENT COUNTRY YES WE ARE IS- DISTRIBUTION IN OUR- IS TO BE A MATTER- WHAT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT IS THAT THE MECHANISM- THE SYSTEM SO THAT WE HAVE AS I MENTIONED. OF THERE MAY BE SOME UP- BROKEN- WHICH IN THEIR- IF WE CAN STRENGTHENING AND- I'LL FIND OUT THE WAY TO MAKE IT TO WORK ON MORE PERFECT WHAT IF- THE AMOUNT IS- IN THE INSUFFICIENT WE CANNOT PROVIDE THE R. MORE DAUGHTERS HERE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE TWENTY CENTS MORE PER MEAL I WONDER HOW EVEN CHILDREN'S MEAL CAN BE PREPARED TO FOUR TWENTIES TWENTY SEC SIX TWENTY CENT INCREMENTAL ADDITION. IT'S ADDITION NOT GETTING COMMENT I GUESS YES ADDITIONAL YES SO 20% FROM- SENSE- UPON ME AND I JUST UNDERSTOOD THAT THAT'S THAT THE WITH THE COST OF THAT THEY CAN- CLAIM FOR REIMBURSEMENT BUT AN ENEMY THE COST DOESN'T AT THIS TIME IS AND NOT THE FOCUS OF MY- QUESTION I. WONDER WHAT THAT THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO DELIVER ARE UNDER SCHOOL AGE MEANS THAT THE VERY YOUNG CHILDREN ALTHOUGH RATHER SEE SOME OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS SO WE'LL GET THE- SUFFICIENT FOOD OR MONEY- SINCE WE DO PROVIDE IN OUR TRIBAL PREVENT STOCK THE HUNGRY PEOPLE METHOD SO A CAT FRESH'S SOMEONE NINE ALL FOR AND OTHER FACTORS MEAL PROGRAM S. AS SO EFFECTIVE I MAIL ALSO A GERMAN CONSISTS OF TENNIS IS ALL THIS IS A WONDERFUL. CON BUT PLEASE SPEAK TO THE BILL YEAH IF I CAN OFFICE SUGGESTION DR YEAH THIS IS JUST MY FINAL COMMENT IS THE HOW TO READ THE PREFERRED LEADERS CHILD THERE SHOULD BE TAKING CARE OF A FAD THAT IN THE WARM OUR HOME ENVIRONMENT RATHER THAN MYSELF I THAT TAKING THE TIME TO SCHOOL TO FEED I DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT APPROACH. TO THAT'S WHAT I'M CONCERNED. AT THE DOCTOR CHOI. YOU HAVE MY CELL NUMBER. YOU KNOW OUR MY OFFICE IS. AND YOU KNOW HOW HOUSE. I BE UP. PLEASE TAKE IT OF IT I'M HAPPY TO DISCUSS THIS WITH YOU SHOULD THIS BE PASSED THE- I'M STILL GONNA BE LOOKING AT FOR OF ON THE- ONCE IT. ALSO PASSES THE- COMMITTEE. YOU'RE ALWAYS TO WORK THIS I A PLACE TO DEBATE AND HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS. I WELCOME YOU TO ALSO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE PERIODS IN BETWEEN THE COMMITTEES AND THE FLOOR VOTES SO- I'M I'M AT YOUR DISPOSAL. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU WITH THAT- LET'S BRING IT BACK- I JUST A COUPLE COMMENTS LOOK SCHOOLS DON'T NEED ONE MORE BURDEN RIGHT NOW. WE NEED THEM OPEN WE NEED THEM SAFE IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE. THIS TIME I WILL. CONCEIT IS NOT A BURDEN BECAUSE IT ISN'T YOU'RE INCENTIVIZING. SCHOOLS TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS- I ALSO THINK NONPROFIT SCHOOLS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE. OF THE- SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM SHOULD TO WILL WE HAVING THAT CONVERSATION GOING FORWARD I'M ALSO- YOU KNOW. MAY GOD BLESS THE TURKEY SANDWICH THAT'S WHAT I WAS RAISED ON YOU KNOW. CHOCOLATE MILK IS UNDER ATTACK TODAY WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO- BUT- I THINK WE DO NEED A BIT MORE RESEARCH YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO CHILDREN TO SAY HEY I'M A PLANT BASED MEAL. IS BETTER THEN MAYBE A PLANT BASED. AND DERRY MAIL RIGHT WAS MEET- I PERSONALLY HAVEN'T SEEN. ENOUGH RESEARCHERS SAY THAT'S THE WAY TO GO I THINK WE NEED TO BE CAUTIOUS THAT BECAUSE CHILDREN NEED PROTEIN. OKAY WE ARE CARNIVORES BY NATURE. RIGHT AND I KNOW SOMEONE TO CHANGE THAT MAYBE THAT'S A GOOD THING THERE IS A BAD THING BUT I ALSO THINK WE SHOULD JUST ASSUME THAT. BECAUSE SOMETHING IS A PLANT THERE ARE NOT GREENHOUSE GASES ASSOCIATED WITH IT BECAUSE THERE ARE TRACTORS THERE IS FUEL FOR THAT TRANSIT TRACTOR EXHAUST THERE IS WATER. THERE LOGISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH DELIVERING WATER THERE'S FERTILIZER SO JUST ASSUME THAT YOU KNOW JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING'S A PLANT. EIGHT IT'S ZERO GREENHOUSE GASES IT'S GOOD I AND IT MAY EVEN BE IN THE END MORE INTENSIVE- THEN THE VENDOR PRODUCTS I DON'T KNOW I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT I'M NOT I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON THAT BUT I JUST THAT'S- THAT'S SOMETHING TO CONTEMPLATE AS WE HAVE THESE. DISCUSSIONS SO WITH THAT I'M GONNA BE SUPPORTIVE OF YOUR BILL THANK YOU MISTER NAZARIAN AND I'VE WORKED WITH A COUPLE OF AUTHORS TO PULL THIS TOGETHER. SO KUDOS TO YOU FOR DOING THAT AND- WITH THAT IS OUR MOTION. MISTER MR LEE MOVES- SCORE OF THE MOVES MR LEE SECONDS AND YOU MAY CLOSE I WILL TAKE YOUR COMMENTS AS A CLOSE MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU THE ONLY THING I WOULD ADD IS AS AS A CARNIVORE MYSELF I JUST I'M JUST TRYING TO OFFER A BALANCE MORE BALANCE THAT'S ALL I NEED IS I MYSELF AM NOT A VEGETARIAN OR VEGAN. I HE COULD CONSUME MEAT AND I'M HAPPY TO THIS IS JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR CHILDREN THAT MAY NOT HAVE SOME OF THE- FUND KEEP. OPPORTUNITIES AT HOME. A TIP TO BE INTRODUCED TO. A VARIETY OF MEALS. GREAT THANK YOU WITH THAT UP PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. FILE ITEM NUMBER SIX AB FIVE FIVE EIGHT THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE O'DONNELL RIGHT DONAL I BENNETT VOTING LEAVE HIS FULLY AYE MCCARTY. AND KIRK SILVA. MARK SILVA I THE BILL HAS FOUR VOTES. AT THE TO THE BILLS OUT FOR VOTE VISITORS ARE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU AGREE WE'RE NOW GOING TO RUN ITS COURSE OF AB FOUR ZERO EIGHT WAS QUICK SO WHAT'S FILE ITEM NUMBER EIGHT. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. THE MCKINNEY VENTO HOMELESS ASSISTANCE ACT IS A FEDERAL LAW CREATED TO COORDINATE RESOURCES AND PROGRAMS FOR STUDENTS. EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. THE ACT PROVIDES FEDERAL FUNDS TO STATES TO IDENTIFY YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. AND TO PROVIDE THEM WITH NEEDED SERVICES. LOCAL HOMELESS. LIAISONS ARE TO PROVIDE AN ARRAY OF SERVICES INCLUDING IDENTIFYING YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND PROVIDING THEM WITH EDUCATIONALLY. RELATED RESOURCES. SUCH AS TUTORING TRANSPORTATION SCHOOL SUPPLIES. FOOD AND COUNSELING TO HELP THEM WITH THEIR ACADEMIC SUCCESS. HOWEVER AND TWENTY NINETEEN A CALIFORNIA STATE AUDIT. YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS REPORTED THAT LOCAL EDUCATION. EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES ARE NOT IDENTIFIED. ADEQUATELY PROVIDING SERVICES TO HOMELESS YOUTH. IN FACT THE L. E. AS THAT WERE VIEWED IN THE AUDIT NONE OF THEM SUFFICIENTLY TRAINED STAFF TO ENSURE THEY WERE AWARE OF INFORMATION THAT COULD HELP THEM IDENTIFY YOUTH WHO NEEDED SERVICES. AS SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN IN THE CLASSROOM WE ARE THE TEACHERS WHO ARE CLOSEST TO FAMILIES NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE CONFERENCES WITH FAMILIES WE SEE THEM AT- SCHOOL EVENTS AND WE LEARNED MANY THINGS ABOUT THEIR FAMILIES IN THIS PANDEMIC THERE WAS QUITE A BIT OF TESTIMONY ABOUT THE LOSS STUDENTS WHAT HAPPENED TO STUDENTS THAT WERE- IF YOU WANT TO SAY GONE MISSING. AND THE TRUTH IS THAT WE FIND OUT THAT INFORMATION BY EITHER BEING DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE STUDENTS IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE FAMILIES KNOCKING ON DOORS BUT UNDERSTANDING THAT WE CAN DO MORE- THIS BILL AB FOUR OH FOUR ZERO EIGHT WOULD REQUIRE. ALLEY A HOMELESS LIAISONS TO OFFER TRAINING ON IDENTIFYING HOMELESS YOUTH TO TEACHERS PARA PROFESSIONALS AND OTHER SCHOOL STAFF WHO HAVE DAILY CONNECTIONS WITH WITH STUDENTS SO THIS IS. THE BRIDGE HERE MANY TIMES OUR LIAISONS ARE HOUSED IN OUR DISTRICT OFFICES MAYBE OFF SITE THIS WOULD AGAIN NOT MANDATE NOT REQUIRE BUT SIMPLY SAY WE HAVE A TRAINING THAT YOUR TEACHERS. OR PARA STAFF CAN BE INVOLVED WITH AND ADDS UP MISTER O'DONNELL KNOWS I TEACHERS OFTEN RECEIVED ANNUAL TRAINING WHETHER IT'S FROM THE LIBRARY LADY WHO COMES IN THE NURSE THIS COULD BE ADDED TO THAT MENU IF. THE SCHOOL SITE USES IT UP WITH THAT I BELIEVE. I HAVE SOME OF YOU HAVE KNOWN ME TESTIFIED BEFORE. HOMELESS STUDENTS- ARE NOT ONLY INCREASING THEIR AT RISK WE WANT TO DO EVERYTHING TO THAT WE CAN TO NOT ONLY IDENTIFY THEM BUT SUPPORT THEM. GREAT THANK HIM AS QUICK SILVA YOU HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY NO WITNESSES FOR THAT'S THAT'S MY ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION SINGING A WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ANY COMMENTS FROM ANY OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS. WE HAD A MOTION I BELIEVE EARLIER. OKAY DO WE LET ME CLARIFY THAT WE DID ON THE MOTION- MISTER LEE MODE MOVING MISTER BENNETT SECOND MISTER CHOI. THANK YOU ALL. ASSEMBLY MEMBER OR SERVER- THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE HOMELESSNESS- SITUATION AND ALSO. CHILDREN COMING TO SCHOOL WITHIN THE HOME SIDE'S NAME A NOT THAT DIFFERENT TO YOU DON'T YOU DON'T IMPACT THAT THEIR- ECONOMIC ACHIEVEMENTS AS WELL AS- MONNING INCENTIVES ETCETERA AND THEN ALSO I DO KNOW THAT THE TEACHERS ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT ANY PHYSICAL ABUSE- ISSUES US WITH A CELL BY LAW REQUIRED. NOW ESTABLISHING- ON EXPLODED UP I READ IT AS A PHOTO ID IS THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE THE TEACHER BUT SOMEBODY OUT OF TO BE. DECIMATED AND TRAINED TO IDENTIFY. HOMELESS SO- CHILDREN APPOINTED AS SO- DO NAY- ALL YOU ARE OFF THAT THE HOMELESS CHILDREN WHAT KIND OF A TRAINING WOULD YOU KEEP WHAT TO LOOK FOR- SO THAT IS- MY QUESTION UNLESS- PROBABLY THE CHILDREN MAY NOT. THE IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES OF WOMAN TARA RETESTED RESEND YOU OUT COMPOSING THIS BILL NO THIRD PARTY TO IDENTIFY AND TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT THE- AND- WHEN I GREW UP. IN KOREA- WE HAD A IN A TEACHER ASSIGNED TO THAT THE WHOLE YEAR- HAD THE PROGRAMMABLE VISITING- H. TIES SO HOME- NOT FOR THESE PURPOSES IN THE HOME THIS PURPOSE IS TOUGH BUT JUST TO. GET ACQUAINTED WITH THE HOME BACK FROM THE WHOLE OF THE TIME JUST DOING ANY CONCERNS THAT THE PARENTS MAY RELATE ABOUT THE CHILD TO THE TEACHER IN ORDER TO GET A PARENT TEACHER RELATIONSHIP BUILDING. SO I THINK THAT YOU KNOW IT WAS A PRETTY GOOD PROGRAM- I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S POSSIBLE IN THIS COUNTRY. TIME WISE OR LEGALLY BUT- STUDENTS ARE PRESENT AT SCHOOL WE ARE TRYING TO FIND TABLE ALL HOME BACKGROUND SO WHAT KIND OF INDICATION SO- SHOULD RETRAIN THE PERSON TO LOOK FOR. I THINK THERE'S MULTIPLE WAYS I MEAN THE FIRST THE FIRST STEP IN THIS BILL WOULD BE THE- HOMELESS LIAISON WORKING WITH A STAFF FOR AN INDIVIDUAL TEACHER IF THEY CHOOSE THAT TRAINING TO SHOW THEM SOME- SIGNS THAT THEY MIGHT LOOK FOR I MEAN IT REPETITIVE ABSENCES. COMING TO- OUR CLASSROOM MAYBE WITH NO SUPPLIES COMING TO SCHOOL POSSIBLY WITH US SCHOOL UNIFORM NOT LAUNDERED THINGS LIKE THAT THE COULD BE SIGNS BUT IT'S ALL VERY SENSITIVE AND PERSONAL BUT WE ALSO KNOW. THE BEST WAY TO MAKE CHANGE IS FROM PERSON TO PERSON AND SO IF AN EDUCATOR HAS MORE INFORMATION OF EITHER RED FLAGS TO NOTICE QUESTIONS TO POSSIBLY ASK WITHIN REASON I THINK THOSE WERE BE THE BEST OUTCOME. AND YOU'RE RIGHT THAT- THE STUDY STUDENTS AND FAMILIES DON'T ALWAYS SELF IDENTIFY. BUT IT'S ALSO TAKING SOME OF THE STIGMA AWAY FROM THIS ISSUE SO THAT THEY FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE SELF IDENTIFYING- THAT THAT'S A ONE OUR APPROACH A HOWEVER WE DO OF SEE OUR PEOPLE LIVING ON THE STREETS AND THE WITH THE CHILDREN AROUND WE NEED TO A LOCKED UP QUICKER TO LIVE- THE TO IDENTIFY WHO THEY ARE WHICH WAS THAT THEY GO TO YES AND ALSO WORKING WITH COLLABORATIVE PARTNERS WHETHER IT'S THE LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT WITH THE- PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT ON THE STREETS SOMETIMES ENGAGING THESE FAMILIES THEMSELVES WHETHER THEY SEE THEM IN CARS WHERE THERE. I MEAN I'LL JUST PERSONALLY SAY WE WALK AROUND OUR BLOCK WE SAW A MOTHER AND HER DAUGHTER ABOUT SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING EVERY MORNING BRUSHING HER DAUGHTER'S CHAIR HAIR RIGHT OUT OF THE SCHOOL AND SO MY THOUGHT WAS KIND OF WHY ARE THEY THERE SO EARLY- WHY IS SHE DOING SOME OF THESE BASIC THINGS YOU WOULD DO AT HOME AND SO WE TALKED TO THE PRINCIPAL AND THEY ACTUALLY WENT OUT AND- TALK TO THOSE THE INDIVIDUALS AND THEY SAID NO THEY WEREN'T HOMELESS BUT THAT THEY HAD TO GET TO SCHOOL EXTREMELY EARLY- BECAUSE THE FATHER HAS A JOB AND HAD TO DROP HIM OFF THAT EARLY AND SHE WANTED TO STAY WITH THEIR DAUGHTER. SO THAT'S JUST AN EXAMPLE OF KIND OF WORKING IN MULTIPLE AREAS TO TRY. TO DO THE BEST WE CAN FOR THE FAMILIES. THANK YOU BRING IT UP TO US ALL OF HAPPY TO MAKE A MOTION. ANY OTHER TWENTY MEMBERS WISHED COMMA WE DO ALREADY HAVE A MOTION. AND A SECOND MISTER CHOI THANK YOU ARE YOU MAKE CLOSE. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. FILE ITEM NUMBER EIGHT AB FOUR AWAIT THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE O'DONNELL. O'DONNELL I BENNETT. SENATE AYE CHAN CHOI HI CHOI I LEAN LEE I MCCARTY PORK SILVA HI QUICK SILVA HI THE BILL HAS FIVE VOTES THE BILL IS OUT THANK YOU MISS WORK SO. WE WANT TO. OKAY YEAH CAN WE WILL TO CLARIFY- CLARIFY THE MOTION FILE ITEM NUMBER TWO A. B. FIFTY EIGHT THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE AND THE BILL DOES HAVE SIX VOTES AGAIN. THAT MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE AN ANSWER FILE ITEM NUMBER TWO A. B. FIFTY EIGHT. AND I'M GONNA PASSED THE GAVEL NOW TO MR. THAT BECAUSE I'M GOING TO PRESENT A BILL. WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A VICE CHAIR. EUROPE MISTER BENNETT RIGHT NOW IT WOULD NOT A SWORN IN- READ IT HERE FROM- MISTER DONALD REGARDING AB DINO TO MR DOLLAR READY FOR YOUR COMMENTS. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AB NINE OH TWO ESTABLISHES AN ALTERNATIVE DESIGN BUILD PILOT PROJECT FOR THE RECRUITMENT OF SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS CONTRACTS. THE JUDICIAL MASSIVE METHOD FOR AWARDING CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS IS DESIGN BID BUILD. WHERE SCHOOL DISTRICT FIRST HIRES AN ARCHITECT TO DESIGN A SCHOOL AND THEN GOES OUT TO BID FOR THE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT KIND OF TO SUIT TWO STEP PROCESS. UNDER DESIGN BUILD A SCHOOL DISTRICT SEEKS BIDS FOR BOTH THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION. HAVING AN ARCHITECTURE ARCHITECT AND CONTRACTOR WORK TOGETHER FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE PROJECT IS MORE EFFICIENT AND HELPS PREVENT PROBLEMS LATER ON IN THE PROCESS THE PRIVATE SECTOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND OTHER AGENCIES HAVE FOUND IS THAT SETTING UP PRICE FOR THE CONTRACT BEFORE A DESIGN HAS STARTED OR HAS BEEN COMPLETED BECAUSE AS ONE OF TWO PROBLEMS. EITHER THE SCHOOL DISTRICT OVER PAYS BECAUSE THE CONSTRUCTION COST PROJECT BY THE BIDDER IS MUCH HIGHER THAN THE TRUE ACTUAL COST WHICH MAY BE A FEW YEARS AFTER THE CONTRACT IS AWARDED. FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICT ENDS UP WITH A FACILITY THAT USES LOWER QUALITY MATERIAL. FOR THAT. ORD ORD. MATERIAL THAT DID THAT DOESNOT MEET THE NEEDS OF THE SCHOOL SUCH AS FEWER CLASSROOMS BECAUSE A CONTRACT AMOUNT CANNOT BE CHANGED. AB NINE OH TWO ALLOWS A LIMITED NUMBER OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO PARTICIPATE IN A PILOT. THAT ALLOWS A SCHOOL DISTRICT TO AWARD AN INITIAL BID THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE CONSTRUCTION COSTS. AND INSTEAD ALLOWS A SCHOOL DISTRICT TO RENEGOTIATE WITH THE DESIGN BUILD TEAM ONCE THERE'S A DESIGN. LAST YEAR THROUGH A BUDGET TRAILER BILL THE STATE'S DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES RECEIVED AUTHORITY TO USE PROGRESSIVE DESIGN BUILD. THIS BILL PROVIDES VERY SIMILAR TO VERY SIMILAR AUTHORIZATION TO DISTRICTS WITH FIFTY THOUSAND OR MORE ADA AND FOR LARGER PROJECTS SO IT'S ABOUT ELEVEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE STATE MORE LOSS. THE JANUARY THIRD VERSION OF THIS BILL WAS BASED ON SUGGESTIONS MADE BY THE OPPOSITION. I UNDERSTAND THEY HAVE ADDITIONAL CONCERNS AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM. THOUGH SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS JUST CAME ABOUT THE LAST COUPLE DAYS THIS BILLS GOING TO PRINT FOR SOMETIME. I ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT TO FURTHER CLARIFY THAT THE PROCESS FOR AWARDING SUBCONTRACTS CON SUBCONTRACTOR CONTRACTS DOES NOT APPLY TO THOSE THAT ARE ALREADY ON THE DESIGN BUILD TEAM. THIS BILL IS SPONSORED BY THE LOS ANGELES% UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS DEBORAH BAUTISTA'S OF OCT. IT HIS PARTY STUFF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS DOUBLE DOUBLE THE SIZE OF A LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WE ARE PLEASED TO SPONSOR AB NINE OH TWO TO ESTABLISH A PILOT PROGRAM AUTHORIZING THE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO USE AN ALTERNATIVE DESIGN BUILD CONTRACTING PROCESS. THE DESIGN BUILD PROCUREMENT METHOD PROVIDES SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH THE USEFUL TOOL THAT RESULTS IN EFFICIENCY AND COST SAVINGS. BY ALLOWING SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO ENTER INTO EIGHT PARTNERSHIPS WITH ENTITIES. THAT CAN BOTH DESIGN AND BUILD SCHOOL FACILITIES THE PARTIES CAN WORK COOPERATIVELY THROUGH THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION PHASES OF THE PROJECT HOWEVER BOTH PARTIES FACE UNCERTAINTY AT THE INCEPTION OF DESIGN BUILD PROJECT. MODERNIZING THE SCHOOL CAMPUS IS OFTEN DONE IN PHASES AND CAN SOMETIMES TAKE UP TO EIGHT YEARS IT IS UNREASONABLE TO HOLD THE CONTRACTOR TO HOLD THE PRICE FOR A PROJECT THAT WILL NOT BE COMPLETED UNTIL EIGHT YEARS FROM NOW. THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS TO PAY FOR THE ACTUAL VALUE OF THE WORK IN STATE INSTEAD OF PAYING CONTRACTORS A LOW COST WHEN THE BIT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PROJECT. AS A SCHOOL DISTRICT TRUST TRUSTED WITH PUBLIC RESOURCES WE DO NOT WANT TO PAY THEM LESS WERE OVERPAID BECAUSE WE GUESSED WRONG. WE WANT TO PAY MARKET VALUE FOR THE QUALITY OF THE WORK PERFORMED. EIGHTY NINE OH TWO WOULD ALLOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND DESIGN BUILDERS TO NEGOTIATE ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION COSTS ONCE THE DESIGN IS COMPLETE. SINCE DESIGN BUILDERS AND THEIR SUBCONTRACTORS WOULD NO LONGER NEED TO ADD CONTINGENCIES TO THEIR PROPOSALS TO COVER FUTURE UNCERTAINTIES THE FINAL CONSTRUCTION COSTS ARE ANTICIPATED TO BE LOWER RESULTING IN SAVINGS. FOR THE REASONS TO INCREASE. EFFICIENCY AND RESULT IN COST SAVINGS THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IS PROUD TO SPONSOR. EIGHTY NINE OH TWO AND URGES YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS PROTESTED DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER REAL. TESTIMONY FIVE FORTY THERE ARE NO FURTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT MR. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE ROOM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- OPPOSITION WITNESSES TO TESTIFY. GIVE US A MOMENT PLEASE TO- SANITIZED. THANK YOU SIR AND COULD YOU PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION. MISTER CHAIR MEMBER SCOTT GOVERNOR BEHALF OF THE CONSTRUCTION EMPLOYERS ASSOCIATION. FIRST I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE TO IN AND THANK THE AUTHOR AND THE STAFF FOR HIS INTELLIGENCE- NEW PROCUREMENT METHODS ARE DIFFICULT FOR THE INDUSTRY TO KIND OF WRAP THEIR HEADS AROUND- WE HAVE BEEN WORKING THEM WITH THEM WE HOPE TO REACH A RESOLUTION. WE HAVE NO ISSUE WITH- ALTERNATIVE DESIGN BUILD PER SE ARE PROGRESSIVE DESIGN BUILD. THE PROBLEM WITH THE BILL A THE MECHANICS OF HOW IT WOULD WORK. AND SPECIFICALLY ALLOWING THE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO PICK AND CHOOSE WHICH SUBCONTRACTORS YOU CAN USE. WHERE THIS METHOD IS USED IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR TODAY THE OWNER COMES UP WITH THE PRICE. IT'S UP TO THE DESIGN BUILD TEAM TO MEET THAT PRICE IF THEIR PRICES TOO HIGH THEN THE TEAM ITSELF FINDS WAYS TO LOWER IT. OR THEY CAN PART WAYS WITH THAT TYPE OF APPROACH WE WOULD CERTAINLY SUPPORT THIS MEASURE BUT WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY IS THERE ANY OTHER OPPOSITION. COMING IN THE ROOM. SEEING NONE COMMITTEE MEMBERS DO YOU HAVE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MITCHELL. ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF DONALD I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS BILL ALL WE EVER I DON'T KNOW WHY. SEE THIS BILL AS A NEEDED. ALL OVER JUST ENTER THE WERE SO THIS BILL IS- GIVING A REQUIRING- LABOR AGREEMENT- OVER THAT THE PROJECTS OVER TEN MILLION DOLLARS BUT WITHOUT THAT THIS BILL WILL BE MORE COMPETITIVE BASED UPON- DOESN'T HAVE TO BE NON NON UNION WHEN IT THE MORE ECONOMICAL BASED UPON THEIR OPERATING COSTS OVER AT THE THAN. WHAT THE COMPANY. SELL ORGANIZED OR NOT. WELL THE BILL DOESN'T REQUIRE LABOR AGREEMENT THERE IS OTHER LAW THAT DOES REQUIRE PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT WHAT THE BILL DOES DO THOUGH IT REQUIRES- THAT A CONTRACTOR USE A SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S VERY FOUNDATIONAL TO ME THOSE ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH. A STATE CERTIFIED APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS THAT DELIVER- QUALITY PROJECT ON TIME AND UNDER BUDGET AND I'LL TELL YOU WHEN IT COMES TO OUR CHILDREN OUR SCHOOL FACILITIES NOTHING'S MORE IMPORTANT RIGHT- MAN I WANT THOSE BUILT WITH THE HIGHEST. QUALITY SKILLED CRAFTSMEN ACROSS WOMAN AS POSSIBLE AND IN MY EXPERIENCE THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH A SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE STATE CERTIFIED. PROGRAM SO BEFORE THIS BILL WITH ANY PROBLEMS. PROBLEMS THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW THEM TO USE THIS IT IS THE THIS BILL WOULD CREATE AN AVENUE ONE MORE PIECE OF POLICY THAT SCHOOLS COULD USE TO CONSTRUCT A CONSTRUCT OF CELANESE IN IN IN WHAT I SEE AS A- A MUCH MORE VALUABLE MANNER. LIKELY SAVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS MONEY. IF THEY WERE TO BE AT THE TABLE AND PARTICIPATE- MORE IN THE IN THE IN THE BIDDING AND ULTIMATELY THE COST. PROCESS OF A SCHOOL FACILITIES. THANK YOU MR O'DONNELL I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS FOR YOU- NUMBER ONE OVERALL I APPRECIATE THAT YOU HAVE MADE THIS A PILOT PROGRAM AND THAT YOU OF LIMITED TO A CERTAIN NUMBER OF MY OWN. DID YOU LIMIT IT TO A CERTAIN NUMBER OF DISTRICTS- SO I APPRECIATE BOTH OF THOSE EFFORTS- WHEN YOU'RE MAKING A CHANGE LIKE THIS AND THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE A REPORT IT'S GOING TO COME OUT. OF AND THAT THIS IS GOING TO SUNSET- SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN REALLY LEARN ABOUT THIS NEW PROCESS THE THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT- AND I THINK THAT. COULD BE HELPFUL FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS IT MAY NOT BE WILL LOOK WE'LL FIND OUT THAT'S WHAT THE PILOT IS ALL ABOUT- ONE QUESTION DO YOU ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS AT THE COMMITTEE- HAS- PROVIDE YOU MISTER BENNETT I DIFFERENT. AND THEN A COULD YOU INFORM US HERE- MISTER GOVERNOR SPOKE ABOUT- ANOTHER AMENDMENT THAT HE WAS WAS HOPING- FOR EXETER AND I JUST LIKE CLARIFICATION MIGHT FROM MY STANDPOINT. THIS IDEA THAT THEY PICK THE SUBCONTRACTORS OR THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT FIX THE SUBCONTRACTORS IS IT YOUR INTENTION WAS TO BUILD TO TRY TO SEE THE SCHOOL DISTRICT SHOULD PICK THE SUBCONTRACTORS. BECAUSE YOU WANT THEM TO BE SKILLED AND TRAINED OR IS THERE A DIFFERENT REASON WHY YOU WANT THAT OR IS THAT AN ACCURATE REPRESENTATION OF YOUR BILL THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT PRESENTS AT COULD YOU REALLY THE OVERALL EFFORT IS A BILL TO ALLOW FOR DISTRICT PARTICIPATION. TO ADDRESS THE COSTS THE ULTIMATE COST OF A PROJECT BUT AGAIN MISTER GOVERNOR HAS COME FOR AND BROUGHT UP SOME VALID POINTS THAT I CAN SEE WE NEED TO HAVE MORE DISCUSSIONS ON SO THE BILL MAY WELL BE FURTHER AMENDED. AND I'M QUITE OPEN TO THOSE CONVERSATIONS THEY JUST CAME UP A LITTLE QUICKER FOR US TO REALLY. SETTLE ON WHAT THE ULTIMATE THANK YOU HOW THE LANGUAGE AGREED ANY. OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBER COMMENTS.
