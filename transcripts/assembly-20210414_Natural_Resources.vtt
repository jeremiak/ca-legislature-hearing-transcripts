ARE TRYING TO DO THE PLANNING

00:39:51.856 --> 00:39:55.092
NECESSARY- BUT BECAUSE OF THE

00:39:55.159 --> 00:39:56.327
ROAD BLOCKS THAT ARE ADDRESSED

00:39:56.393 --> 00:40:00.631

00:40:00.698 --> 00:40:03.768
FROM THE DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY-

00:40:03.834 --> 00:40:07.104
MAYBE OUTSIDE OF LABOR- THEY'RE

00:40:07.171 --> 00:40:09.073
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THEIR

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:10.875
INABILITY TO PUT TOGETHER A

00:40:10.941 --> 00:40:14.044

00:40:14.111 --> 00:40:15.279
YOU KNOW A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF

00:40:15.346 --> 00:40:18.616

00:40:32.163 --> 00:40:34.398
A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION-

00:40:34.465 --> 00:40:36.767
SO- YOU KNOW EIGHT IT DOES NOT

00:40:36.834 --> 00:40:40.571
ELIMINATE. THE PROCESS IT DOES

00:40:40.638 --> 00:40:41.138
NOT ELIMINATE BECAUSE NOBODY

CLOSE BUT WHAT YOUR BILL IS

00:40:54.485 --> 00:40:55.853
TALKING ABOUT IS THE DUPLICATE

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:58.622

THING YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO DO

00:41:04.428 --> 00:41:05.863

00:41:08.999 --> 00:41:11.569
TOGETHER- AND I'VE SEEN PROJECT

00:41:11.635 --> 00:41:13.871
AFTER PROJECT STALLED OUT NOT

BECAUSE IT'S NOT A GOOD PROJECT

00:41:15.472 --> 00:41:16.607
IT'S BECAUSE THEY USE THAT

00:41:16.674 --> 00:41:18.642

BECAUSE WE SIMPLY ARE NOT BEING

00:56:36.726 --> 00:56:38.695
ABLE TO GET INTO THE- IT GET

00:56:38.762 --> 00:56:40.263
PAST THE PART THAT IS REALLY

00:56:40.330 --> 00:56:44.033
BROKEN- SO IT'S HARD FOR ME TO

00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:47.303
SUPPORT PILING ON LIKE THIS-

00:56:47.370 --> 00:56:49.005
YOU KNOW THE BIKE LANE CONCEPT

00:56:49.072 --> 00:56:50.840
I THINK CAN BE INCORPORATED IN

00:56:50.907 --> 00:56:52.041
A LOT OF THESE EXISTING LIKE

00:56:52.108 --> 00:56:53.243
THE METROPOLITAN AREAS YOU'RE

00:56:53.309 --> 00:56:54.978
TALKING ABOUT. THEY HAVE PLENTY

00:56:55.044 --> 00:56:56.513
OF ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE THAT CAN

00:56:56.579 --> 00:56:58.348
BE CONVERTED TO BIKING FIRST IN

00:56:58.414 --> 00:57:02.852
LINE INRASTRUCTURE. YOU DON'T

00:57:02.919 --> 00:57:03.820
NEED CAL TRANSGENDER ACTOR THE

00:57:03.887 --> 00:57:05.522
MONEY IN FROM. OUR ROAD- BILL.

00:57:05.588 --> 00:57:07.257
THE THEY NEEDED CAN TO DO OUT

00:57:07.323 --> 00:57:09.659
IN AREAS LIKE IN MY DISTRICT.

00:57:09.726 --> 00:57:10.960
SO THE PEOPLE CAN GET AROUND

00:57:11.027 --> 00:57:13.997
NOT JUST FROM FROM OUR AREA TO

00:57:14.063 --> 00:57:16.733
OUTLYING COUNTIES.TO GET TO

00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:18.067
GET TO WORK BUT JUST SO THEY

00:57:18.134 --> 00:57:19.702
CAN GET AROUND TOWN SO THEY CAN

00:57:19.769 --> 00:57:21.971
GET TO THE GROCERY STORE THEY

00:57:22.038 --> 00:57:22.505
CAN GET TO THE NEIGHBORING

00:57:22.572 --> 00:57:26.843
CITIES- SO- YOU KNOW I THINK

00:57:26.910 --> 00:57:30.180
THIS IS. A GREAT FRIEND TO THE

00:57:30.246 --> 00:57:32.982
LONG TERM FUTURE SOME DAY IF WE

00:57:33.049 --> 00:57:33.583
CAN TAKE CARE THE UNDERLYING

00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:35.451
PROBLEMS FIRST. AND UNTIL I SEE

00:57:35.518 --> 00:57:36.653
THAT IT'S HARD FOR ME TO GET

00:57:36.719 --> 00:57:38.421
BEHIND THESE THESE ARE THE TYPE

00:57:38.488 --> 00:57:40.423
OF INITIATIVES THANK YOU. OKAY

FORWARD. I DO OBVIOUSLY HAVE

00:57:48.431 --> 00:57:50.600
SOME CONCERNS IN AND I CONCERT

00:57:50.667 --> 00:57:51.568
IS REALLY IN THE IMPLEMENTATION

00:57:51.634 --> 00:57:53.570
OF THIS YOU AND I HAVE.

00:57:53.636 --> 00:57:54.704
TRAVELED A LOT OF THE DOWN THE

00:57:54.771 --> 00:57:58.274
STATE TOGETHER RECENTLY AND- IF

00:57:58.341 --> 00:58:00.643
WE LOOK AT THAT CALIFORNIA WE

00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:01.211
LOOK AT THE APPROACH OF THIS

00:58:01.277 --> 00:58:03.813
BILL IS TAKING. IT'S ONCE AGAIN

00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:04.814
IT SEEMS LIKE A VERY BROAD

00:58:04.881 --> 00:58:07.383
STROKE. AND COMING FROM OUR

00:58:07.450 --> 00:58:09.419
PARTICULAR AREA OF THE WORLD IN

00:58:09.485 --> 00:58:11.354
THE CENTRAL VALLEY. I KNOW THE

00:58:11.421 --> 00:58:12.722
BILL STATES THAT MULTIPLE

00:58:12.789 --> 00:58:14.157
COUNTIES TO WORK TOGETHER TO

00:58:14.224 --> 00:58:15.658
CREATE THESE PLANS. BUT EVEN

00:58:15.725 --> 00:58:17.260
THAT IS INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING

00:58:17.327 --> 00:58:18.728
BUT I DO JUST HAVE A QUICK

00:58:18.795 --> 00:58:20.330
QUESTION IN THE BILL LANGUAGE

00:58:20.396 --> 00:58:22.799
IT TALKS ABOUT. REQUIRING

00:58:22.866 --> 00:58:24.868
CALTRANS TO SUBMIT TO SEE- TO

00:58:24.934 --> 00:58:27.203
SEE THIS IS. WHY I'M FOURTEEN

00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:29.405
THAT PAGE FOUR OF MY OF THE

00:58:29.472 --> 00:58:32.342
ANALYSIS- BEFORE JULY FIRST

00:58:32.408 --> 00:58:33.042
TWENTY TWENTY ONE CALTRANS TO

00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:34.711
SUBMIT TO CTC A PROPOSAL FOR

00:58:34.777 --> 00:58:36.846
APPROVAL. PRESIDENTIAL ATP

00:58:36.913 --> 00:58:38.514
FUNDING FOR A PILOT PROGRAM TO

00:58:38.581 --> 00:58:39.916
ESTABLISH BRANDED NETWORKS A

00:58:39.983 --> 00:58:43.086
BICYCLE HIGHWAYS. OKAY WE'RE

00:58:43.152 --> 00:58:43.620
GOING TO ESTABLISH BICYCLE

00:58:43.686 --> 00:58:45.855
HIGHWAYS. BUT IT ONE OF IN THE

00:58:45.922 --> 00:58:48.291
SUBSECTION. IS SAYS RESTRICT

00:58:48.358 --> 00:58:50.126
THAT USED TO THAT NETWORK TO

00:58:50.193 --> 00:58:53.263
BICYCLISTS. ARE WE EVEN AT THIS

00:58:53.329 --> 00:58:55.298
POINT WE'RE TRYING TO GET

00:58:55.365 --> 00:58:57.166
PEOPLE OUT OF VEHICLES RIGHT.

00:58:57.233 --> 00:58:58.735
INTO LOW EMISSION THINGS

00:58:58.801 --> 00:59:00.470
BICYCLES DOES THAT MEAN

00:59:00.536 --> 00:59:02.672
SCOOTERS AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER

00:59:02.739 --> 00:59:04.440
TYPES OF TRANSPORTATION WILL

00:59:04.507 --> 00:59:05.775
NOT BE ALLOWED ON THESE BICYCLE

00:59:05.842 --> 00:59:06.809
HIGHWAYS BECAUSE IN THE

00:59:06.876 --> 00:59:09.012
LANGUAGES THAT RESTRICTS USE OF

00:59:09.078 --> 00:59:11.114
THE NETWORK TO BICYCLISTS. SO I

00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:12.348
JUST BE CURIOUS ABOUT THE CASE

00:59:12.415 --> 00:59:14.050
WELL THANKS FOR THE QUESTION

00:59:14.117 --> 00:59:15.218
AND LET ME SAY THAT. I KNOW

00:59:15.285 --> 00:59:17.487
THAT THE BICYCLE PIECE OF THIS

00:59:17.553 --> 00:59:19.689
SEEMS TO BE GETTING A LOT OF

00:59:19.756 --> 00:59:21.157
ATTENTION BUT THE BILL IS NOT.

00:59:21.224 --> 00:59:23.293
ABOUT BIKE LANES THE BILL IS

00:59:23.359 --> 00:59:25.795
ABOUT PLANNING FOR JOBS FOR

00:59:25.862 --> 00:59:27.730
HOUSING FOR MAKING LAND USE

00:59:27.797 --> 00:59:28.865
DECISIONS THAT REDUCE VEHICLE

00:59:28.932 --> 00:59:30.199
MILES TRAVELED THE BIKE PIECE

00:59:30.266 --> 00:59:31.801
IS A PART OF IT. BUT THERE'S A

00:59:31.868 --> 00:59:33.303
WHOLE LOT OF OTHER STUFF IN

00:59:33.369 --> 00:59:35.238
HERE AND THREE SEVENTY FIVE SO

00:59:35.305 --> 00:59:36.239
I WANT TO COME BACK TO THAT OF

00:59:36.306 --> 00:59:37.740
MY CLOSING. BUT IN TERMS OF

00:59:37.807 --> 00:59:38.474
THAT I THINK THAT THEY'RE

00:59:38.541 --> 00:59:39.442
TALKING ABOUT JUST THAT

00:59:39.509 --> 00:59:40.810
PARTICULAR SECTION BUT WE CAN

00:59:40.877 --> 00:59:43.179
pRIGHT AND BY THE WAY BYE BYE K.

00:59:43.246 --> 00:59:44.113
WITH IT DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE

00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:45.481
BUILDING. NECESSARILY AN

00:59:45.548 --> 00:59:48.318
ELEVATED HIGHWAY IT MEANS TO

00:59:48.384 --> 00:59:48.885
HAVE NETWORKS TO CONNECT TO

00:59:48.952 --> 00:59:50.453
EACH OTHER. FOR EXAMPLE IN

00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:51.654
GLENDALE WE SPENT A LOT OF

00:59:51.721 --> 00:59:53.222
MONEY ON A BIKE LANE THAT'S

00:59:53.289 --> 00:59:54.457
ABOUT A MILE AND A HALF IT

00:59:54.524 --> 00:59:56.025
DOESN'T YET CONNECT TO THE L.

00:59:56.092 --> 00:59:57.660
A. RIVER BIKE PATH IF YOU

00:59:57.727 --> 00:59:59.295
CONNECT THEM YOU NOW HAVE A BUY

00:59:59.362 --> 01:00:00.129
KILEY WHERE PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY

01:00:00.196 --> 01:00:02.498
COMMUTE. USING THIS SYSTEM A

01:00:02.565 --> 01:00:04.067
PROTECTED BIKE LANES BUT IF

01:00:04.133 --> 01:00:05.868
THEY'RE NOT CONNECTED. THEY

01:00:05.935 --> 01:00:07.103
BECOME SOMETHING THAT VERY FEW

01:00:07.170 --> 01:00:08.538
PEOPLE CAN USE FOR PRACTICAL

01:00:08.604 --> 01:00:09.872
REASONS OTHER THAN KIND OF

01:00:09.939 --> 01:00:10.573
HAVING A LITTLE BIT OF

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:12.308
RECREATION. SO IT'S TRYING TO

01:00:12.375 --> 01:00:14.377
ENCOURAGE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

01:00:14.444 --> 01:00:15.578
DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES TO

01:00:15.645 --> 01:00:16.779
CONNECT TOGETHER SO THAT YOU'RE

01:00:16.846 --> 01:00:17.814
CONNECTING YOUR RESIDENTIAL

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:19.749
PEOPLE WITH YOUR JOB CENTERS WE

01:00:19.816 --> 01:00:20.817
CAN CERTAINLY FINESSE THE

01:00:20.883 --> 01:00:22.385
LANGUAGE TO. MAKE IT CLEAR THAT

01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:23.419
WHATEVER IS ALLOWABLE UNDER

01:00:23.486 --> 01:00:25.221
THOSE YOU KNOW THOSE ORDINANCES

01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:26.456
IF YOU'RE ALLOWED TO RIDE AN E.

01:00:26.522 --> 01:00:28.524
BIKE. ON THE LANE MAYBE YOU CAN

01:00:28.591 --> 01:00:29.659
DO IT MAYBE THERE'S A REASON

01:00:29.726 --> 01:00:30.660
YOU WOULD WANT TO DO IT IN

01:00:30.727 --> 01:00:31.227
CERTAIN PLACES BUT WE'RE NOT

01:00:31.294 --> 01:00:32.729
TRYING TO BE THAT PRESCRIPTIVE

01:00:32.795 --> 01:00:34.197
OR RESTRICTIVE WERE TRYING TO

01:00:34.263 --> 01:00:36.432
LEAVE. IT UP TO INDIVIDUAL

01:00:36.499 --> 01:00:37.133
COMMUNITIES HAVE DIFFERENT

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:39.135
NEEDS AND ARE ARE DIFFERENT

01:00:39.202 --> 01:00:40.770
TYPES OF COMMUNITIES TO FIND

01:00:40.837 --> 01:00:42.672
THEIR OWN WAY TO REDUCE GHG

01:00:42.739 --> 01:00:45.441
WITH IN THEIR OWN. WORLD IN A

01:00:45.508 --> 01:00:46.909
VERY SUBURBAN COMMUNITY FOR

01:00:46.976 --> 01:00:48.211
INSTANCE MAYBE YOU'RE NOT GONNA

01:00:48.277 --> 01:00:49.312
BE BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE

01:00:49.379 --> 01:00:50.179
MAYBE YOU'RE GOING TO BE

01:00:50.246 --> 01:00:52.749
ALLOWING. MORE THE FARMERS

01:00:52.815 --> 01:00:53.583
MARKET SO THE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE

01:00:53.649 --> 01:00:54.684
TO DRIVE TO THE GROCERY STORES

01:00:54.751 --> 01:00:55.985
ON SATURDAY THAT'S SOMETHING

01:00:56.052 --> 01:00:57.587
THAT CAN BE A PLAN THAT REDUCES

01:00:57.653 --> 01:00:59.255
YOUR G. H. T. MAYBE YOU CHANGE

01:00:59.322 --> 01:01:00.790
YOUR ZONING TO ALLOW PIANO

01:01:00.857 --> 01:01:01.624
LESSONS IN A RESIDENTIAL

01:01:01.691 --> 01:01:03.393
NEIGHBORHOOD OR CHIROPRACTORS

01:01:03.459 --> 01:01:05.428
OR CORNER BODEGAS. THINGS THAT

01:01:05.495 --> 01:01:07.130
GIVE PEOPLE A CHANCE OF MOVING

01:01:07.196 --> 01:01:08.598
AROUND THEIR COMMUNITY WITHOUT

01:01:08.664 --> 01:01:11.300
HAVING TO DRIVE LONG DISTANCES

01:01:11.367 --> 01:01:12.268
THOSE ARE THE KIND I TO. THINGS

01:01:12.335 --> 01:01:12.902
THAT ARE ELLA. WITHIN PLAN TO

01:01:12.969 --> 01:01:13.936
SHOW THAT YOU'RE REDUCING.

01:01:14.003 --> 01:01:15.605
MILES TRAVELED. IS TO TRY TO

01:01:15.671 --> 01:01:17.774
MAKE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE. NOT

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:19.509
RURAL COMMUNITIES BUT BUDGETS

01:01:19.575 --> 01:01:21.544
MORE METROPOLITAN. SUBURBAN

01:01:21.611 --> 01:01:23.379
COMMUNITIES. FOR THEM TO LOOK

01:01:23.446 --> 01:01:24.680
AT THEIR OWN COMMUNITY AND

01:01:24.747 --> 01:01:25.681
FIGURE OUT WHAT WOULD GIVE

01:01:25.748 --> 01:01:26.983
PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:28.818
DRIVE. LESS HOW DO WE BRING

01:01:28.885 --> 01:01:30.520
THOSE JOBS CLOSER TO HOUSING

01:01:30.586 --> 01:01:32.388
HOW DO WE ALLOW FOR MORE USES.

01:01:32.455 --> 01:01:34.757
REDUCE SPRAWL OR JUST FORCING

01:01:34.824 --> 01:01:36.225
PEOPLE TO ALWAYS DRIVE JUST TO

01:01:36.292 --> 01:01:37.627
GET A GALLON OF MILK. THAT'S

01:01:37.693 --> 01:01:39.395
WHAT THE BILL IS ABOUT. THAT'S

01:01:39.462 --> 01:01:40.997
WHY IT HAS TO BE BROUGHT IT HAS

01:01:41.064 --> 01:01:42.331
TO BE BROAD BECAUSE YOU DON'T

01:01:42.398 --> 01:01:43.533
WANT TO BE PRESCRIPTIVE IN THE

01:01:43.599 --> 01:01:44.367
BILL. YOU WANT TO GIVE

01:01:44.434 --> 01:01:45.635
DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES THE

01:01:45.701 --> 01:01:47.370
CHANCE TO INNOVATE. AND TO DO

01:01:47.437 --> 01:01:49.038
WHAT WORKS FOR THEIR COMMUNITY.

01:01:49.105 --> 01:01:50.573
BUT THE GOALS ARE THE SAME

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:52.642
ACROSS THE STATE. FIND WAYS TO

01:01:52.708 --> 01:01:54.010
GIVE PEOPLE CHANCES OF MOVING

01:01:54.077 --> 01:01:55.778
AROUND THEIR COMMUNITY. IN WAYS

01:01:55.845 --> 01:01:57.080
OTHER THAN CARS WHETHER IT'S BY

01:01:57.146 --> 01:01:59.715
BIKES OR SCOOTERS. AND LOOK AT

01:01:59.782 --> 01:02:02.919
YOUR OWN LAND USE TO SEE HOW

01:02:02.985 --> 01:02:03.486
YOU'VE CREATED A BARRIER TO

01:02:03.553 --> 01:02:05.154
WALKABILITY. NOT TO GET TOO FAR

01:02:05.221 --> 01:02:06.355
OFF THE TOPIC I LIVE IN A

01:02:06.422 --> 01:02:07.490
COMMUNITY WHERE I HAVE TO WALK

01:02:07.557 --> 01:02:08.524
TWO MILES TO GET A GALLON OF

01:02:08.591 --> 01:02:10.193
MILK. WHY CAN'T THERE BE A

01:02:10.259 --> 01:02:11.828
CORNER BODEGA OR LITTLE GROCERY

01:02:11.894 --> 01:02:13.296
STORE ALLOW ON THE MAIN DRAG IN

01:02:13.362 --> 01:02:14.597
MY SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD. MY

01:02:14.664 --> 01:02:16.632
CITY DOESN'T ALLOW IT. SO THOSE

01:02:16.699 --> 01:02:19.435
ARE THE KINDS OF INTROSPECTIVE.

01:02:19.502 --> 01:02:21.571
OF SELF LOOKING WE WANT OUR

01:02:21.637 --> 01:02:22.572
COMMUNITIES TO BE THINKING

01:02:22.638 --> 01:02:23.639
ABOUT AND THAT'S WHY IT IS

01:02:23.706 --> 01:02:25.608
BROAD AND GOAL ORIENTED RATHER

01:02:25.675 --> 01:02:26.909
THAN PRESCRIPTIVE AND WILL LOOK

01:02:26.976 --> 01:02:27.910
AT THE LANGUAGE AROUND THE BIKE

01:02:27.977 --> 01:02:29.378
HIGHWAYS FOR SURE. BE SURE YOU

01:02:29.445 --> 01:02:30.346
BRING THAT UP TO MEXICO AND I

01:02:30.413 --> 01:02:31.414
DIDN'T CATCH THAT THERE'S A

01:02:31.481 --> 01:02:32.715
PARTICULAR REASON I DO AND WHO

01:02:32.782 --> 01:02:33.850
HAS YOUR RIGHT THERE'S A LOT OF

01:02:33.916 --> 01:02:35.618
OTHER THINGS IN THIS BILL THAT.

01:02:35.685 --> 01:02:37.653
I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU ON-

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:38.688
IN ONE OF MY IN LARGER CITIES

01:02:38.754 --> 01:02:39.689
OF MY DISTRICT THEY DID THEY

01:02:39.755 --> 01:02:41.657
CREATED A BIKE LANE BETWEEN A

01:02:41.724 --> 01:02:43.025
JUNIOR COLLEGE. AND WE WANT

01:02:43.092 --> 01:02:44.927
CAMPUS AND ANOTHER. NOBODY USES

01:02:44.994 --> 01:02:46.963
IT. BUT THEY WERE REQUIRED TO

01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:48.564
SPEND THE MONEY ON THIS

01:02:48.631 --> 01:02:49.565
PARTICULAR PROJECT SO IT HAD TO

01:02:49.632 --> 01:02:51.434
BE DONE. AND LITERALLY NOBODY

01:02:51.501 --> 01:02:52.768
USES IT BECAUSE TO YOUR POINT

01:02:52.835 --> 01:02:54.604
THAT CONNECTS WITH NOTHING. I

01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:56.005
MEAN THIS TO JUNIOR COLLEGE

01:02:56.072 --> 01:02:58.307
CAMPUSES. BUT PEOPLE DRIVE THEY

01:02:58.374 --> 01:03:00.276
DON'T USE IT. SO IS GORGEOUS-

01:03:00.343 --> 01:03:01.711
ESSENTIALLY WASTE OF MONEY FOR

01:03:01.777 --> 01:03:02.879
A LOT OF WAYS AND NOW IT'S KIND

01:03:02.945 --> 01:03:03.646
OF BEEN DOING LIKE THE HOMELESS

01:03:03.713 --> 01:03:04.780
HIGHWAY THE ONLY PEOPLE YOU SEE

01:03:04.847 --> 01:03:06.149
IT. ON IT IS HOMES PEOPLE

01:03:06.215 --> 01:03:08.084
PUSHING A CART AROUND. THAT IS

01:03:08.151 --> 01:03:09.352
NOT WHAT WE WANT TO DO HERE I'M

01:03:09.418 --> 01:03:10.987
ASSUMING SO. IF THERE IS A

01:03:11.053 --> 01:03:13.389
METHOD OR AND AN IDEA THAT WE

01:03:13.456 --> 01:03:15.191
CAN ALLOW FOR LOCAL CONTROL. TO

01:03:15.258 --> 01:03:16.826
ALLOW THOSE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS

01:03:16.893 --> 01:03:18.027
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO STATE

01:03:18.094 --> 01:03:20.163
TO STATE. TO PUT A MANDATE OR

01:03:20.229 --> 01:03:21.130
REQUIREMENT ON THE WE HAVE TO

01:03:21.197 --> 01:03:22.565
DO THIS. THEN WE JUST DO STUPID

01:03:22.632 --> 01:03:24.100
PROJECTS JUST TO CHECK A BOX

01:03:24.167 --> 01:03:25.067
RIGHT SO EXPECT TO JUST

01:03:25.134 --> 01:03:26.536
REMEMBER THAT WHAT THIS DOES IS

01:03:26.602 --> 01:03:28.237
IT DOESN'T SPECIFY ANY TYPE OF

01:03:28.304 --> 01:03:29.372
PROJECT THAT THE CITY HAS TO

01:03:29.438 --> 01:03:30.840
DO. IT SAYS USE YOUR OWN

01:03:30.907 --> 01:03:32.909
PLANNING YOU MUST PLAN TO DO

01:03:32.975 --> 01:03:33.943
THIS IN A WAY THAT MAKES SENSE

01:03:34.010 --> 01:03:35.378
FOR YOUR COMMUNITY. SO WE'RE

01:03:35.444 --> 01:03:36.712
NOT FORCING THEM TO DO ANY

01:03:36.779 --> 01:03:39.649
PARTICULAR. KIND OF PROJECT WE

01:03:39.715 --> 01:03:41.651
THEY ALL HAVE THEIR CARDS THEY

01:03:41.717 --> 01:03:43.252

THEIR REGIONAL. NETWORKS ALL

01:03:46.155 --> 01:03:49.292
WE'RE SAYING IS WHEN YOU MAKE-YOUR PLANS. NTERNALLY AND

01:03:49.358 --> 01:03:51.761
REGIONALLY. YOU MUST FIND WAYS

01:03:51.827 --> 01:03:52.495
TO REDUCE VEHICLE MILES

01:03:52.562 --> 01:03:54.096
TRAVELED IF THIS. THEY

01:03:54.163 --> 01:03:55.164
SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT

01:03:55.231 --> 01:03:56.165
PARTICULAR PLAN IF THEY DIDN'T

01:03:56.232 --> 01:03:57.900
HAVE DATA SHOW WOULD ACTUALLY.

01:03:57.967 --> 01:03:59.368
BE USEFUL THAT'S NOT ON THE

01:04:02.305 --> 01:04:06.242
PLANNING. OR MAYBE MISSED

01:04:06.309 --> 01:04:07.176
JUDGING OR MAY AB THERE SOME

01:04:07.243 --> 01:04:07.843
OTHER VERY MAYBE IT IS. THE

01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:09.212
HOMELESS. PEOPLE ARE. NOT TO

01:04:09.278 --> 01:04:09.812

THOSE AMENDMENTS MIGHT OFFER-

01:38:55.229 --> 01:38:56.297
CAL RECYCLE THE SAME

01:38:56.363 --> 01:38:58.766

TAKING SO LET ME GET BACK TO

01:39:11.912 --> 01:39:13.714
ENOUGH AND THE REASON I ASK

01:39:13.781 --> 01:39:15.883
THAT IS BECAUSE A IN DEALING

01:39:15.949 --> 01:39:17.351
WITH- MANY OF THE OTHER

01:39:17.418 --> 01:39:19.286
MANDATES THAT HAVE BEEN HANDED

01:39:19.353 --> 01:39:21.021
DOWN IN REGARDS TO RECYCLING

01:39:21.088 --> 01:39:23.324
WHICH I THINK MOST MOST PEOPLE

01:39:23.390 --> 01:39:25.526
SUPPORT RECYCLING. WHEN THE AND

01:39:25.592 --> 01:39:27.394
GAME CAN'T BE ACHIEVED. BUT

01:39:27.461 --> 01:39:28.929
WE'RE STILL RAMMING THINGS DOWN

01:39:28.996 --> 01:39:30.698
THE THROATS OF LOCAL

01:39:30.764 --> 01:39:32.166
GOVERNMENTS AND ALSO THE WASTE

01:39:32.232 --> 01:39:34.001
INDUSTRIES THAT ARE TRYING TO.

01:39:34.068 --> 01:39:35.769
TRYING TO ACHIEVE BUT JUST

01:39:37.037 --> 01:39:40.140
YET- CAL RECYCLED HANS IT

01:39:40.207 --> 01:39:43.043
CONSISTENTLY- REFERS BACK TO

01:39:43.110 --> 01:39:44.712
THE FACT THAT DOUBLES WE HAVE

01:39:44.778 --> 01:39:46.880
NO FLEXIBILITY. AND SO THAT DID

01:39:46.947 --> 01:39:48.782
IT TO ME I THINK THESE THINGS

01:39:48.849 --> 01:39:50.651

01:41:17.571 --> 01:41:18.772

THERE'S BEEN THIS FRAUD PUT

01:41:20.707 --> 01:41:24.344

RECYCLE THAT'S NOT THE CASE AND

01:41:58.278 --> 01:41:59.146
SO WE NEED TO HAVE A REALITY

01:41:59.213 --> 01:42:01.582
CHECK. AND BASED ON THE

01:42:01.648 --> 01:42:03.350
WORLDWIDE MARKET CONDITIONS AND

01:42:03.417 --> 01:42:05.319

RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA IT'S

JUST DON'T ALIGN MYSELF WITH MY

01:42:31.378 --> 01:42:32.513
COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO THINK

01:42:32.579 --> 01:42:34.414

GETTING RECYCLED BUT I THINK WE

01:42:44.858 --> 01:42:46.760
WERE ALL LED TO BELIEVE THAT

01:42:46.827 --> 01:42:48.562
THESE ARE RECYCLABLE ITEMS.

01:42:48.629 --> 01:42:50.497

ARE EVER RECYCLING TO LANDFILL

01:42:52.199 --> 01:42:54.535

01:42:54.601 --> 01:42:57.371
CIRCULAR ECONOMY REALLY

01:54:12.312 --> 01:54:14.414
ACUTE IN RURAL AREAS AND THE

01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:15.515
PANDEMIC HAS MADE THINGS EVEN

01:54:15.582 --> 01:54:17.350
WORSE MUCH OF THE MODERN

IT STANDS TODAY IS EFFECTIVELY

01:54:28.661 --> 01:54:29.829
IMPOSSIBLE FOR RESIDENTS IN

01:54:29.896 --> 01:54:31.264
HUMBOLDT COUNTY TO REDEEM THEIR

01:54:31.331 --> 01:54:33.466
CRB CONTAINERS BEFORE THE

01:54:33.533 --> 01:54:34.767
PANDEMIC THERE WERE ONLY THREE

01:54:34.834 --> 01:54:37.136
REDEMPTION CENTERS THAT SERVE

01:54:37.203 --> 01:54:37.737
THE FOUR THOUSAND SQUARE MILE

01:54:37.804 --> 01:54:40.740
COUNTY. LIKE MANY BUSINESS.

OWNERS AND BUSINESSES ACROSS

01:54:41.908 --> 01:54:43.243
THE STATE THOSE REDEMPTION

01:54:43.309 --> 01:54:44.544
CENTERS WERE FORCED TO CLOSE

01:54:44.611 --> 01:54:45.945
DURING THE MANDATORY SHUT DOWN

01:54:46.012 --> 01:54:47.614
ORDER. WHEN THE SHUTDOWN ORDER

01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:49.215
WAS LIFTED ONLY ONE REDEMPTION

01:54:49.282 --> 01:54:50.717
CENTER REMAIN TO SERVE BECAUSE

01:54:50.783 --> 01:54:52.318
CONSUMERS IN THE COUNTY. AND

01:54:52.385 --> 01:54:53.886
THE PENT UP DEMAND WAS TRULY

01:54:53.953 --> 01:54:55.989
AMAZING. THE LINES AND CROWDS

01:54:56.055 --> 01:54:57.423
OF FORM CAUSE TRAFFIC JAMS IT

01:54:57.490 --> 01:54:58.725
BACKED UP ON THE HIGHWAY

01:54:58.791 --> 01:54:59.759
CREATED A PUBLIC SAFETY

01:54:59.826 --> 01:55:02.028
SITUATION SO SEVERE THAT COUNTY

01:55:02.095 --> 01:55:02.829
OFFICIALS WERE FORCED TO CLOSE

01:55:02.895 --> 01:55:04.964
THE CENTER. AS A RESULT THERE

01:55:05.031 --> 01:55:07.300
ARE NOW ZERO REDEMPTION CENTERS

01:55:07.367 --> 01:55:09.535
IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY. TODAY A

01:55:09.602 --> 01:55:11.838
RESIDENT OF ARCADIA. WHO WANTS

01:55:11.904 --> 01:55:13.640
TO REDEEM THEIR CRB CONTAINERS

01:55:13.706 --> 01:55:15.408
WOULD HAVE TO DRIVE EITHER ONE.

01:55:15.475 --> 01:55:17.410

ASSUMING THE HIGHWAYS OPEN

01:55:20.680 --> 01:55:21.547

LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS TO IDENTIFY

01:55:29.122 --> 01:55:30.723
A HANDFUL OF SMALL CHANGES THAT

01:55:30.790 --> 01:55:31.991
WOULD ALLOW RECYCLING CENTERS

01:55:32.058 --> 01:55:34.227
TO RE OPEN. IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY.

01:55:34.294 --> 01:55:35.528
AS A RESULT THE BILL DOES FOUR

01:55:35.595 --> 01:55:37.196
THINGS. THAT AUTHORIZES CALVET

BOTTLE BILL PROGRAM. NUMBER TWO

01:55:47.206 --> 01:55:48.574
IT REQUIRES CAL RECYCLE TO

01:55:48.641 --> 01:55:49.842
DEVELOP A PROCESS THAT WOULD

01:55:49.909 --> 01:55:51.144
ALLOW RECYCLING CENTERS TO

OPERATE BY APPOINTMENT. THREE

01:55:54.881 --> 01:55:56.549
IT EXEMPTS DEALERS DELIVERING

MORNING JERRY THIS AND MEMBERS

02:14:22.554 --> 02:14:24.189
OF THE COMMITTEE- I MICHAEL

02:14:24.256 --> 02:14:25.791
O'CONNELL PRESIDENT AND CEO OF

02:14:25.857 --> 02:14:27.125
IRVINE RANCH CONSERVANCY

02:14:27.192 --> 02:14:29.060
LOCATED IN ORANGE COUNTY WE'RE

02:14:29.127 --> 02:14:30.529
A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION AND WE

02:14:30.595 --> 02:14:32.364
MANAGE THIRTY THOUSAND ACRES OF

02:14:32.431 --> 02:14:33.965
FIRE PRONE URBAN WILDLAND IN

02:14:34.032 --> 02:14:35.467
CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH PUBLIC

02:14:35.534 --> 02:14:37.702
LAND OWNERS. THE MOST IMPORTANT

02:14:37.769 --> 02:14:38.804
POINT I WANT TO MAKE TODAY IS

02:14:38.870 --> 02:14:40.539
THAT WILDFIRES DIFFERENT UP AND

02:14:40.605 --> 02:14:41.840
DOWN THE STATE BUT WE HAVE

02:14:41.907 --> 02:14:42.941
HISTORICALLY ADDRESSED FIRE

02:14:43.008 --> 02:14:45.510
RISK FROM AN APPROACH FOCUSED

02:14:45.577 --> 02:14:45.944
MOSTLY ON FUELS AND

02:14:46.011 --> 02:14:47.979
SUPPRESSION. THERE ARE IN FACT

02:14:48.046 --> 02:14:49.448
TWO MAJOR TYPES OF WILDFIRE

02:14:49.514 --> 02:14:50.515
THAT REQUIRE VERY DIFFERENT

02:14:50.582 --> 02:14:52.617
SOLUTIONS THE FIRST FIELD

02:14:52.684 --> 02:14:53.852
DOMINATED FIRE IS MORE

02:14:53.919 --> 02:14:55.287
CONVENTIONAL AND REQUIRES FUEL

02:14:55.353 --> 02:14:57.122
REDUCTION IN TREATMENT BUT THE

02:14:57.189 --> 02:14:58.557
WILD LAND IN COASTAL SOUTHERN

02:14:58.623 --> 02:15:00.225
CALIFORNIA HAVE THE SECOND TYPE

02:15:00.292 --> 02:15:02.194
WHICH IS NGUYEN DOMINATED FIRE.

02:15:02.260 --> 02:15:03.195
OUR RISK IS DUE TO THE

02:15:03.261 --> 02:15:04.396
COMBINATION OF HIGH WINDS AND

02:15:04.463 --> 02:15:05.664
IGNITIONS AND IS NEARLY

02:15:05.730 --> 02:15:07.799
INDEPENDENT OF FUELS WE NEED TO

02:15:07.866 --> 02:15:08.800
BETTER INTEGRATE THIS

02:15:08.867 --> 02:15:10.502
UNCONVENTIONAL TYPE OF WILDFIRE

02:15:10.569 --> 02:15:12.103
INTO STATE RESPONSE IN ORDER TO

02:15:12.170 --> 02:15:13.472
REDUCE THE RISK TO OUR

02:15:13.538 --> 02:15:15.273
COMMUNITIES AND WILDLANDS WE

02:15:15.340 --> 02:15:17.509
NEED RESOURCES DIRECTED TO THE

02:15:17.576 --> 02:15:18.109
APPROPRIATE SOLUTIONS IN EACH

02:15:18.176 --> 02:15:20.145
REGION. THE THREAT OF WIND

02:15:20.212 --> 02:15:21.580
DOMINATED FIRES ARE NOT EVER

02:15:21.646 --> 02:15:22.614
GOING TO BE REDUCED BY

02:15:22.681 --> 02:15:24.082
RESTORING FORESTS ARE THINNING

02:15:24.149 --> 02:15:28.019
OUT DEAD WOOD IN ORANGE COUNTY

02:15:28.086 --> 02:15:28.587
WE DON'T EVEN HAVE FORCE WE

02:15:28.653 --> 02:15:29.187
HAVE TROUBLE AND- THIS IS THE

02:15:29.254 --> 02:15:30.021
MOMENT FOR THE LEGISLATURE

02:15:30.088 --> 02:15:32.457

MORE REGIONALLY APPROPRIATE

02:15:33.592 --> 02:15:35.527
APPROACH. BASED ON HOW FIRE

02:15:35.594 --> 02:15:37.262

THE STATE HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS

02:21:34.752 --> 02:21:36.621
ACTUALLY. IT SOUNDS LIKE

02:21:36.688 --> 02:21:38.323
YOU'RE- YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE

02:21:38.389 --> 02:21:41.192
TERRAIN ITSELF NOT THE OTHER

02:21:41.259 --> 02:21:43.695
ASPECTS. IN DECIDING AND I CAN

02:21:43.761 --> 02:21:45.230
USE OUR OUR COMMUNITY AS AN

02:21:45.296 --> 02:21:46.464
EXAMPLE WE ALMOST BURNED P THE

02:21:46.531 --> 02:21:47.999
WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD. BECAUSE WE

02:21:48.066 --> 02:21:51.102
WERE NOT ABLE TO- IN FRENCH ON

02:21:51.169 --> 02:21:55.173
THE AREA THAT IS HABITAT. AND

02:21:55.240 --> 02:21:59.043
THAT HABITAT- BURNED UP ALONG

02:21:59.110 --> 02:22:01.579
WITH EVERYTHING ELSE AROUND IT.

02:22:01.646 --> 02:22:02.146
WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

02:22:02.213 --> 02:22:04.515
CLEAR THAT AREA. SO THAT WE

02:22:04.582 --> 02:22:05.750
WOULD SAVE THE REST OF THE

02:22:05.817 --> 02:22:08.086
HABITAT IT'S THERE IT ALMOST

02:22:08.152 --> 02:22:10.088
SOUNDS LIKE THIS IS ONE OF

02:22:10.154 --> 02:22:11.522
THOSE IMPEDIMENTS TO WHAT WE'RE

02:22:11.589 --> 02:22:13.791
TRYING TO DO BEFORE WELL IT IT

02:22:13.858 --> 02:22:15.093
SHOULDN'T BE AN IMPEDIMENT TO

02:22:15.159 --> 02:22:16.628
ANYTHING BECAUSE WHAT THE BILL

02:22:16.694 --> 02:22:18.663
IS INTENDED TO DO IS SET UP- A

02:22:18.730 --> 02:22:20.899
PROCESS FOR DETERMINING. IF THE

02:22:20.965 --> 02:22:22.934
BILL ITSELF DOES NOT DETERMINE

02:22:23.001 --> 02:22:25.236
WHICH AREA- AND WHICH

PROCESS FOR DETERMINING. IF

02:22:30.208 --> 02:22:32.877
THAT BECOMES. A KIND OF CATCH

02:22:32.944 --> 02:22:34.679

LITTLE BIT AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER

FORWARD AND I DO PLAN TO

02:23:12.116 --> 02:23:13.952
SUPPORT IT TODAY BUT- I DO WANT

02:23:14.018 --> 02:23:15.586
TO POINT OUT. IT'S TAKING A

02:23:15.653 --> 02:23:16.688
VERY DIFFERENT APPROACH TO WHAT

02:23:16.754 --> 02:23:18.823
I'M- THAN THAN WHAT I'M DOING

02:23:18.890 --> 02:23:19.457
IN A BILL THAT JUST PASSED IN

02:23:19.524 --> 02:23:21.492
THIS COMMITTEE. I GUESS WHAT

02:23:21.559 --> 02:23:23.628
CONCERNS ME IS THAT. MY

02:23:23.695 --> 02:23:25.430
PERCEPTION OF THIS IS THAT THIS

02:23:25.496 --> 02:23:27.398
IS KIND OF A TOP DOWN APPROACH.

02:23:27.465 --> 02:23:29.400
CALIFORNICA READS THE DOCUMENT

02:23:29.467 --> 02:23:30.535
AND THEN ALL THE REGION'S KINDA

02:23:30.601 --> 02:23:32.003
DO THEIR WORK OUT BEHIND THE

02:23:32.070 --> 02:23:34.238
SCENES. THAT KIND OF NEGATES

02:23:34.305 --> 02:23:36.174
THE- THE GOOD WORK IS BEING

02:23:36.240 --> 02:23:38.142
DONE IN MY DISTRICT BY GROUPS

02:23:38.209 --> 02:23:39.143
LIKE NORTH COAST RESOURCE

02:23:39.210 --> 02:23:41.879
PARTNERSHIP. AND OTHERS- AND

02:23:41.946 --> 02:23:43.715
WHAT THEY REALLY NEED THEIR OF

02:23:43.781 --> 02:23:44.816
THEIR THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND

02:23:44.882 --> 02:23:46.384
THEY KNOW THEIR TERRAIN THEY

02:23:46.451 --> 02:23:47.719
KNOW THE REGION'S WHAT THEY

02:23:47.785 --> 02:23:49.420
NEED IS THE TECHNICAL SUPPORT.

02:23:49.487 --> 02:23:50.989
TO GET TROUGH A PROCESS TO

02:23:51.055 --> 02:23:53.124
QUALIFY FOR GRANTS. FROM CAL

02:23:53.191 --> 02:23:54.859
FIRE AND CALIO WAS SENT OUT

02:23:54.926 --> 02:23:57.829
CARILLO YES AND OTHERS. SO WE'D

02:23:57.895 --> 02:23:59.464
REALLY LIKE. WHAT I'D REALLY

02:23:59.530 --> 02:24:01.265
LIKE TO SEE IS THAT CALVET

02:24:01.332 --> 02:24:02.867
MAYBE CALIFORNIA. CREATES A

02:24:02.934 --> 02:24:06.170
DOCUMENT BASED UPON. THE WORK

02:24:06.237 --> 02:24:08.039
IS BEING DONE ON THE GROUND NOT

02:24:08.106 --> 02:24:10.108
JUST TAKING STAKEHOLDER INPUT.

02:24:10.174 --> 02:24:11.743
THAT'S A VERY DIFFERENT PROCESS

02:24:11.809 --> 02:24:13.044
BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S SOME

02:24:13.111 --> 02:24:14.078
PRIDE TO SOME FOLKS THAT ARE

02:24:14.145 --> 02:24:15.780
DOING REALLY REALLY GOOD WORK.

02:24:15.847 --> 02:24:17.749
THAT ARE GONNA BE LIKE WAIT A

02:24:17.815 --> 02:24:18.716
SECOND WE'RE ALREADY DOING

02:24:18.783 --> 02:24:20.752
THIS. WHAT READ BEING TOLD FROM

02:24:20.818 --> 02:24:22.954
A TOP DOWN. WAY THAT THIS IS

02:24:23.021 --> 02:24:24.622
THAT THIS IS THE WAY IT'S GOING

02:24:24.689 --> 02:24:27.692
TO BE. SO HELP ME UNDERSTAND.

02:24:27.759 --> 02:24:28.993
YOU KNOW IF THAT'S THEY MIGHT

02:24:29.060 --> 02:24:30.328
IF I MISS PERCEIVING WHAT

02:24:30.395 --> 02:24:31.863
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE I. AND

02:24:31.929 --> 02:24:33.197
I WANT TO WORK WITH YOU BECAUSE

02:24:33.264 --> 02:24:34.432
AND I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING YOU

02:24:34.499 --> 02:24:36.267
DID ON THAT WHILE FAR PACKAGE

02:24:36.334 --> 02:24:38.069
FOR US AND- IT MEANS A LOT.

02:24:38.136 --> 02:24:39.904
IT'S A VERY IN MY MIND IS A

02:24:39.971 --> 02:24:41.339
VERY DIFFERENT APPROACH THAN

02:24:41.406 --> 02:24:43.041
WHAT. WHAT I'M LOOKING AT NIGHT

02:24:43.107 --> 02:24:44.876
COMPLETELY RECOGNIZE THAT

02:24:44.942 --> 02:24:46.544
CHAPARRAL AND SOME OF THE OTHER

02:24:46.611 --> 02:24:47.545
HABITATS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF

02:24:47.612 --> 02:24:49.680
STATES. ARE VERY VERY DIFFERENT

02:24:49.747 --> 02:24:51.349
AND THE REGIONAL INPUT IS

02:24:51.416 --> 02:24:55.520
CRITICAL TO THAT. BUT I'M NOT

02:24:55.586 --> 02:24:56.988
SURE THAT A TOP DOWN DOCUMENTS-

02:24:57.055 --> 02:24:58.956
WITH THAT WITH THE WITH CAL

02:24:59.023 --> 02:25:00.558
FIRE WHO'S ALREADY STRETCHED

02:25:00.625 --> 02:25:03.061
BEYOND THEIR LIMITS- ENDS IN

02:25:03.127 --> 02:25:04.228
FIRE SUPPRESSION YEAR AFTER

02:25:04.295 --> 02:25:06.330
YEAR. IS THE RIGHT APPROACH TO

02:25:06.397 --> 02:25:08.032
DO THAT. NOT ALSO JUST WANT TO

02:25:08.099 --> 02:25:10.034
POINT ONE THING. WHILE I

02:25:10.101 --> 02:25:11.536
APPRECIATE THE HERE IN YOUR

02:25:11.602 --> 02:25:12.904

02:28:12.650 --> 02:28:16.220
REGIONS ARE RESPECTED IN THE

02:28:16.287 --> 02:28:16.821
PLANNING THAT WE DO THROUGHOUT

02:28:16.887 --> 02:28:17.822
THE STATE. BUT SO I GUESS I

02:28:17.888 --> 02:28:19.123
WOULD THEN ASK HIM YOU KNOW AND

02:28:19.190 --> 02:28:20.224
MAYBE A QUESTION FOR HIM IS

02:28:20.291 --> 02:28:21.859
WHAT DO YOU NEED THE MOST DO

02:28:21.926 --> 02:28:23.261
YOU NEED THE RESOURCES TO DO

02:28:23.327 --> 02:28:24.662
THESE PROJECTS. OR DO YOU NEED

02:28:24.729 --> 02:28:26.464
A DOCUMENT THAT OUTLINES HOW

02:28:26.530 --> 02:28:27.832
YOU DO THAT AND THAT'S AND

02:28:27.898 --> 02:28:30.801
THAT'S WHERE THAT'S WHERE THAT.

02:28:30.868 --> 02:28:31.535
IS PROBABLY STILL ON THE LINE

02:28:31.602 --> 02:28:34.905
IF- WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS YEAH.

02:28:34.972 --> 02:28:36.641
HIS PERSPECTIVE ON. HI I AM

02:28:36.707 --> 02:28:37.942
STILL THE LINE I APPRECIATE

02:28:38.009 --> 02:28:40.344
YOUR- YOUR QUESTION ASSEMBLY

02:28:40.411 --> 02:28:43.314
MEMBER WOULD AND I ACTUALLY-

02:28:43.381 --> 02:28:45.316
THINK THAT AND I'VE SAID BEFORE

02:28:45.383 --> 02:28:46.617
THAT I THINK. A BOTTOM UP

02:28:46.684 --> 02:28:48.419
APPROACH IS REALLY THE ONLY WAY

02:28:48.486 --> 02:28:49.320
THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO

02:28:49.387 --> 02:28:52.390
EFFECTIVELY. MANAGE FIRE RISK.

02:28:52.456 --> 02:28:54.358
GIVEN HOW DIVERSE THE FIRE RISK

02:28:54.425 --> 02:28:56.027
PROFILES ARE IN VARIOUS PARTS

02:28:56.093 --> 02:28:58.496
OF THE STATE. AND I TOTALLY

02:28:58.562 --> 02:29:01.065
APPRECIATE THE- THE NATURE OF

02:29:01.132 --> 02:29:03.000
THE FIRE ON THE NORTH COAST

02:29:03.067 --> 02:29:04.435
ALONG THE COASTAL AREAS TO HELP

02:29:04.502 --> 02:29:06.404
WIN DOMINATED FIRES BUT- IT'S

02:29:06.470 --> 02:29:09.874
REALLY IMPORTANT TO US THAT- WE

02:29:09.940 --> 02:29:11.475
BE ABLE TO DEVELOP. OUR

02:29:11.542 --> 02:29:13.077
SOLUTIONS THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO

02:29:13.144 --> 02:29:14.945
OUR REGIONS. WHICH IS WHY WE'RE

02:29:15.012 --> 02:29:16.314
SO EXCITED ABOUT THE ARE FSC

02:29:16.380 --> 02:29:18.816
PROGRAM. AND THEN HAVE THAT

02:29:18.883 --> 02:29:21.519
INTEGRATED. INTO THE STATES OF

02:29:21.585 --> 02:29:24.121
THE STATE CAN SUPPORT THOSE-

02:29:24.188 --> 02:29:25.823
THOSE PROCESSES AND SO I THINK.

02:29:25.890 --> 02:29:27.425
I THINK THESE. TWO BILLS SEEM

02:29:27.491 --> 02:29:29.660
TO BE COMING AT IT. THE SAME

02:29:29.727 --> 02:29:30.895
THING FROM TWO DIFFERENT

02:29:30.961 --> 02:29:34.432
DIRECTIONS AND HOPEFULLY THEY

02:29:34.498 --> 02:29:35.766
CAN MEET IN THE MIDDLE. IT

02:29:35.833 --> 02:29:37.468
AFTER SHE THOUGHT THANK YOU.

02:29:37.535 --> 02:29:39.904
