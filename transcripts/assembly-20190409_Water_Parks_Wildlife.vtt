00:39:28.632 --> 00:39:30.801
WERE STILL ARGUABLY BEING TAKEN

00:39:30.868 --> 00:39:31.936
TO SLAUGHTER.

00:39:32.002 --> 00:39:33.204
HAD CALIFORNIA PROVIDED

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:35.272
ENFORCEMENT HAD CALIFORNIAN THE

00:39:35.339 --> 00:39:36.540
VOTERS ACTUALLY WANTED TO HAVE A

00:39:36.607 --> 00:39:38.809
FINER PENALTY FOR VIOLATION

00:39:38.876 --> 00:39:39.944
GREATER THAN THE PRICE OF AN

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:41.312
IPHONE I THINK THAT WE WOULD

00:39:41.378 --> 00:39:42.346
HAVE SEEN.

00:39:42.413 --> 00:39:44.048
MUCH MORE ENFORCEMENT ON THE

00:39:44.115 --> 00:39:45.683
ACTIVE FORCES BEING TAKEN

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:47.451
ILLEGALLY OUT OF CALIFORNIA ON

00:39:47.518 --> 00:39:48.753
THAT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND IN MY

00:39:48.819 --> 00:39:50.921
MEMBERS DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE

00:39:50.988 --> 00:39:52.556
WITH EXPANDING THE PROHIBITION

00:39:52.623 --> 00:39:54.391
TO ANY COMMERCIAL PURPOSE WHEN

00:39:54.458 --> 00:39:55.292
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS

00:39:55.359 --> 00:39:56.193
SHOWN.

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:58.129
OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS THAT

00:39:58.195 --> 00:39:59.296
WE HAVE NOT EVEN ABLE BILL WE

00:39:59.363 --> 00:40:01.766
HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ENFORCE.

00:40:01.832 --> 00:40:03.367
THE FACT THAT HORSES ARE STILL

00:40:03.434 --> 00:40:04.435
BEING TAKEN FOR SLAUGHTER FOR

00:40:04.502 --> 00:40:06.203
HUMAN CONSUMPTION.

00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:07.371
IN TWENTY YEARS SINCE THE

00:40:07.438 --> 00:40:09.540
PASSAGE OF PROPOSITION SIX ONLY

00:40:09.607 --> 00:40:10.541
TO INDIVIDUALS IN THE STATE OF

00:40:10.608 --> 00:40:11.742
CALIFORNIA HAVE EVER BEEN

00:40:11.809 --> 00:40:12.943
CHARGED.

00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:14.311
WITH POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS OF

00:40:14.378 --> 00:40:17.281
THAT INITIATIVE AND NONE OF THEM

00:40:17.348 --> 00:40:17.782
HAD SERVED ANY JAIL TIME

00:40:17.848 --> 00:40:18.082
[inaudible]

00:40:18.149 --> 00:40:19.784
IN ADDITION.

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:21.719
EXCUSE ME IN ADDITION THE OTHER

00:40:21.786 --> 00:40:22.820
COMPONENT OF THIS LEGISLATION

00:40:22.887 --> 00:40:24.355
THAT CAUSES SOME CONCERN AND

00:40:24.421 --> 00:40:25.856
DEFINITELY SOME POTENTIAL

00:40:25.923 --> 00:40:27.625
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IS WHAT

00:40:27.691 --> 00:40:28.959
THAT RESERVE PRICE FOR THAT

00:40:29.026 --> 00:40:30.461
MARKET PRICE WILL BE.

00:40:30.528 --> 00:40:31.629
I THINK IT'S PRETTY WELL KNOWN

00:40:31.695 --> 00:40:33.531
AT LEAST TO THE SPONSORS AND AND

00:40:33.597 --> 00:40:34.365
TO THE AUTHOR FOR OFFICE AND

00:40:34.431 --> 00:40:36.534
COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT THERE

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:37.067
ISN'T REALLY A MARKET RATE

00:40:37.134 --> 00:40:38.836
THAT'S A MARKET RATE THAT'S

00:40:38.903 --> 00:40:40.304
DETERMINED BY EITHER THE UNITED

00:40:40.371 --> 00:40:42.239
STATES IS WHAT THE PRICE PER

00:40:42.306 --> 00:40:43.541
POUND.

00:40:43.607 --> 00:40:44.742
MAYBE FOR FOR STATE AND NOT

00:40:44.809 --> 00:40:46.076
SOMETHING THAT'S A PROBLEM AS

00:40:46.143 --> 00:40:47.812
WELL BUT SPECIFICALLY IF WE'RE

00:40:47.878 --> 00:40:49.613
TALKING ABOUT SETTING A RESERVE

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:50.981
AT A PRICE FOR AUCTION.

00:40:51.048 --> 00:40:52.283
THESE AUCTIONS SIR DISTINCTLY

00:40:52.349 --> 00:40:54.985
TWO PURPOSES THE FIRST PURPOSES.

00:40:55.052 --> 00:40:56.954
THE ONE WHICH IS I THINK THE

00:40:57.021 --> 00:40:59.156
INTEREST OF OF THE SPONSOR IS

00:40:59.223 --> 00:41:00.558
WELL IF THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT

00:41:00.624 --> 00:41:01.959
ARE TRYING TO SAVE AND RESCUE

00:41:02.026 --> 00:41:03.194
THESE HORSES IT IS TO PROVIDE

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:04.395
THESE HORSES WITH THE BETTER

00:41:04.461 --> 00:41:06.197
CHANCE AND SECOND CHANCE OF LIFE.

00:41:06.263 --> 00:41:07.698
THE OTHER PURPOSE OF THIS IS

00:41:07.765 --> 00:41:09.700
UNFORTUNATELY THE REALITY THAT

00:41:09.767 --> 00:41:12.203
SUMMER FINDING THEIR WAY THROUGH

00:41:12.269 --> 00:41:13.838
THIS WATER PIPELINE.

00:41:13.904 --> 00:41:14.305
IF IN FACT WE ARE PUT

00:41:14.371 --> 00:41:15.973
ESTABLISHING A MARKET RESERVE A

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:17.875
MARKET CAP.

00:41:17.942 --> 00:41:19.610
WHAT HAPPENS TO THE HORSES WHEN

00:41:19.677 --> 00:41:20.945
THAT RESEARCHERS AT MET?

00:41:21.011 --> 00:41:22.213
DO THEY GET ABANDONED DO THEY

00:41:22.279 --> 00:41:23.981
GET LEFT BEHIND ARE THEY STILL

00:41:24.048 --> 00:41:25.816
TURNED OVER TO SOME OTHER ENTITY

00:41:25.883 --> 00:41:27.451
FOR SLAUGHTER OR ARE WE ACTING

00:41:27.518 --> 00:41:29.753
AS A DISINCENTIVE FOR RESCUES.

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:31.655
AND SANCTUARIES OR ANY OTHER

00:41:31.722 --> 00:41:33.257
INDIVIDUAL INTERESTED IN BUYING

00:41:33.324 --> 00:41:35.826
THE HORSE TO ADOPT THAT HORSE I

00:41:35.893 --> 00:41:36.861
THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME

00:41:36.927 --> 00:41:38.195
SERIOUS CONSIDERATION IF WE ARE

00:41:38.262 --> 00:41:39.964
MOVING TOWARDS ESTABLISHING A

00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:40.497
MARKET PRICE.

00:41:40.564 --> 00:41:41.866
WHAT THAT MAYBE AND SOME OF THE

00:41:41.932 --> 00:41:43.701
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT

00:41:43.767 --> 00:41:45.603
COULD COME ABOUT -- I'VE TAKEN

00:41:45.669 --> 00:41:47.838

TESTING NOT TESTIFYING ON BEHALF

00:42:41.926 --> 00:42:43.861
OF THE CALIFORNIA HORSEMEN'S

00:42:43.928 --> 00:42:46.530

00:42:47.898 --> 00:42:50.167
POLITICAL ANIMALS VIEWS THE

00:42:50.234 --> 00:42:53.537
ORGANIZATION THAT CREATED.

00:42:53.604 --> 00:42:54.705
WROTE.

00:42:54.772 --> 00:42:58.342
AND CAMPAIGN FOR PROPOSITION SIX

00:42:58.409 --> 00:42:59.510
SO WE WERE PRESENT.

00:42:59.576 --> 00:43:01.812
AT THE CREATION OF THE PREVIOUS

00:43:01.879 --> 00:43:04.114
WITNESS SAID SOMETHING WITH

00:43:04.181 --> 00:43:08.285
WHICH WE DO AGREE -- AND THAT'S

00:43:08.352 --> 00:43:09.520
THAT.

00:43:09.586 --> 00:43:10.788
BLOOM WITH PROPOSITION SIX HAS

00:43:10.854 --> 00:43:12.022
BEEN ENFORCEMENT.

00:43:12.089 --> 00:43:15.125
AND WE WOULD ASK OF THAT ALL OUR

00:43:15.192 --> 00:43:17.261
POSITION ON THIS BILL IS

00:43:17.328 --> 00:43:18.028
SUPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED.

00:43:18.095 --> 00:43:20.464
WE WOULD ASK -- FIRST OF ALL

00:43:20.531 --> 00:43:22.833
THAT THE BILL ACTUALLY FOCUS ON

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:25.069
ENFORCEMENT -- WE HAD EARLY

00:43:25.135 --> 00:43:27.371
ENFORCEMENT SUCCESSES WHEN PROP

00:43:27.438 --> 00:43:29.340
SIX WAS -- IN ACTED -- WORKING

00:43:29.406 --> 00:43:30.941
WITH THEN ATTORNEY GENERAL BILL

00:43:31.008 --> 00:43:33.844
LOCKYER AND DISTRICT ATTORNEY AT

00:43:33.911 --> 00:43:36.246
J. GOALS FROM KERN COUNTY -- THE

00:43:36.313 --> 00:43:36.747
DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND

00:43:36.814 --> 00:43:39.783
AGRICULTURE ACTUALLY INSPECTED.

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:41.318
TRUCKS AS THEY WERE LEAVING

00:43:41.385 --> 00:43:44.321
CALIFORNIA AND SURVEYED AS TO

00:43:44.388 --> 00:43:44.888
WHETHER THEY WERE BOUND FOR

00:43:44.955 --> 00:43:46.223
SLAUGHTER AND WAS ABLE TO TURN

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:47.858
THOSE BACK.

00:43:47.925 --> 00:43:49.626
PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING --

00:43:49.693 --> 00:43:51.996
WE THEN WENT TO SEE IF WE COULD

00:43:52.062 --> 00:43:53.397
GET THE HIGHWAY PATROL TO DO

00:43:53.464 --> 00:43:56.567
THAT BECAUSE FOOD IN AG FRANKLY --

00:43:56.633 --> 00:43:59.603
LOST INTEREST WE THINK A BILL

00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:01.472
THAT HAS LANGUAGE IN IT.

00:44:01.538 --> 00:44:04.575
THAT DIRECTS THAT ALL HORSES

00:44:04.641 --> 00:44:06.343
BEING TRANSFERRED OUT OF

00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:07.644
CALIFORNIA.

00:44:07.711 --> 00:44:10.748
MUST BE INSPECTED AND CERTIFIED

00:44:10.814 --> 00:44:12.416
AND CLEARED TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE

00:44:12.483 --> 00:44:13.784
NOT GOING TO SLAUGHTER.

00:44:13.851 --> 00:44:16.053
BY EITHER FOOD IN A BAG OR THE

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:18.355
HIGHWAY PATROL -- THAT IS A HUGE

00:44:18.422 --> 00:44:20.591
PIECE WE THINK THE OTHER PIECE

00:44:20.657 --> 00:44:22.826
THAT GIVES US PROBLEMS WITH THIS

00:44:22.893 --> 00:44:23.761
BILL.

00:44:23.827 --> 00:44:25.863
IS THE CONFUSION IN THE BILL

00:44:25.929 --> 00:44:32.870
OVER -- THE MISDEMEANOR COUNT.

00:44:32.936 --> 00:44:35.873
OF FOR SLAUGHTER OF HORSES FOR

00:44:35.939 --> 00:44:37.441
ECONOMIC PURPOSES.

00:44:37.508 --> 00:44:39.443
FIRST OF ALL CURRENTLY WE ARE

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:42.179
UNAWARE OF OTHER ECONOMIC

00:44:42.246 --> 00:44:44.548
PURPOSES FOR WHICH SLOW HORSES

00:44:44.615 --> 00:44:45.282
ARE SLAUGHTERED.

00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:48.352
THEN FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION --

00:44:48.419 --> 00:44:50.888
BUT IF THE LAW WERE TO GET IT OR

00:44:50.954 --> 00:44:53.657
IF ECONOMIC PRACTICES WERE TO

00:44:53.724 --> 00:44:56.660
EVOLVE OR DEVOLVE.

00:44:56.727 --> 00:44:58.429
OF WHERE -- HORSES WERE

00:44:58.495 --> 00:44:59.696
SLAUGHTERED FOR OTHER HUMAN

00:44:59.763 --> 00:45:02.533
CONSUMPTION TO US THERE IS NO

00:45:02.599 --> 00:45:04.868
EXCUSE NONE AT ALL. FOR MAKING

00:45:04.935 --> 00:45:06.537
THAT A MERE MISDEMEANOR WHICH

00:45:06.603 --> 00:45:08.439
REALLY BECOMES A LICENSE FEE FOR

00:45:08.505 --> 00:45:09.873
SOMEONE WHO SEES AN ECONOMIC

00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:11.141
BENEFIT.

00:45:11.208 --> 00:45:12.976
AND WE BELIEVE THAT.

00:45:13.043 --> 00:45:15.212
THE OLD THE PENALTY LANGUAGE

00:45:15.279 --> 00:45:20.150
SHOULD TRACK THE FELONY LANGUAGE

00:45:20.217 --> 00:45:22.453
THAT COULD CURRENTLY EXISTS WITH

00:45:22.519 --> 00:45:23.587
PROPOSITION.

00:45:23.654 --> 00:45:24.588
SIX WE AFTER A LOT OF BLOOD

00:45:24.655 --> 00:45:26.924
SWEAT AND TEARS ON THE FLOOR. TO

00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:29.493
ENACT PROPOSITION SIX MANY OF

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:33.630
THE ANIMAL ESTABLISHMENT GROUPS --

00:45:33.697 --> 00:45:35.299
HUMANE SOCIETY OF THE UNITED

00:45:35.365 --> 00:45:37.434
STATES PETER STATE OUT OF THE

00:45:37.501 --> 00:45:39.069
PROP SIX CAMPAIGN EVEN THOUGH

00:45:39.136 --> 00:45:40.504
THEY LATER CLAIM CREDIT AFTER IT

00:45:40.571 --> 00:45:44.842
PASSED -- BUT WE ARE VERY

00:45:44.908 --> 00:45:47.911
CONSCIOUS OF ANY.

00:45:47.978 --> 00:45:51.648
UNINTENDED -- UNDERMINING OF OF

00:45:51.715 --> 00:45:54.518
PROPOSITION SIX AND WE ARE WE

00:45:54.585 --> 00:45:57.187
ARE AT A LOSS TO UNDERSTAND WHY

00:45:57.254 --> 00:45:59.656
SLAUGHTER OF HORSES FOR ECONOMIC

00:45:59.723 --> 00:46:01.191
PURPOSES IS A MISDEMEANOR.

00:46:01.258 --> 00:46:03.093
BUT SLAUGHTER OF HORSES FOR

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:05.762
HUMAN PURPOSES IS A FELONY THEY

00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:08.432
ALL SHOULD BE FELONIES -- A AND

00:46:08.499 --> 00:46:10.000
THE OTHER PROBLEM THAT THAT

00:46:10.067 --> 00:46:12.136
CREATES LIVES IN THE CURRENT

00:46:12.202 --> 00:46:13.837
LANGUAGES IT DOES CREATE.

00:46:13.904 --> 00:46:16.140
A CONFUSION -- I KNOW THAT

00:46:16.206 --> 00:46:17.875
THERE'S LANGUAGE IN THE BILL

01:26:06.261 --> 01:26:08.630
HUNDRED SALES AND AT AT THE TIME

01:26:08.696 --> 01:26:10.365
ST LOUIS CAME IN THAT DAY ABOUT

01:26:10.431 --> 01:26:11.866
TWO MILLION OF IT TWENTY TIMES

01:26:11.933 --> 01:26:13.134
INCREASE IN ABUNDANCE.

01:26:13.201 --> 01:26:15.904
AND I WOULD SIGH I WOULD GUESS.

01:26:15.970 --> 01:26:19.173
A SEVENTY OR 80% INCREASING BY

01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:20.375
MAGIC NOT A 100%.

01:26:20.441 --> 01:26:21.676
AND FLOOR THERE'S BEEN A SIMILAR

01:26:21.743 --> 01:26:23.678
SITUATION ALSO FLOOR AND OTHERS

01:26:23.745 --> 01:26:24.679
WELL OVER TWO MILLION NOW SO

01:26:24.746 --> 01:26:25.513
IT'S NOT ONLY LUCIANA BUT THE

01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:27.649
PROGRAMS ALSO IN FLORIDA ON SOME

01:26:27.715 --> 01:26:28.283
OF THE OTHER STATES -- THIS ALL

01:26:28.349 --> 01:26:36.357
THESE TWO MILLION IN FLORIDA AND

01:26:36.424 --> 01:26:36.891
IN LOUISIANA YES SIR OKAY

01:26:36.958 --> 01:26:37.191
[inaudible]

01:26:37.258 --> 01:26:38.092
SO.

01:26:38.159 --> 01:26:39.093
YOU WOULD SAY THAT ALLIGATOR

01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:40.261
FARMS.

01:26:40.328 --> 01:26:40.728
HAVE BEEN GOOD FOR THE

01:26:40.795 --> 01:26:41.029
POPULATION.

01:26:41.095 --> 01:26:42.897
SO LET ME ASK THE QUESTION --

01:26:42.964 --> 01:26:43.431
ALLIGATORS AND CROCODILES

01:26:43.498 --> 01:26:46.734
ENDANGERED.

01:26:46.801 --> 01:26:48.303
SO THAT THERE ARE SOME SPECIES

01:26:48.369 --> 01:26:50.838
THAT ARE IN DANGER HOWEVER -- A

01:26:50.905 --> 01:26:52.373
LUMBER A LOT OF THEM ARE NOT

01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:53.441
ENDANGERED ANYMORE.

01:26:53.508 --> 01:26:54.976
THE ONLY REASON TO HAVE

01:26:55.043 --> 01:26:56.978
RETAINING SOCIETIES IS BECAUSE

01:26:57.045 --> 01:26:58.446
SCIENCE HEALTH REGULAR THE

01:26:58.513 --> 01:26:59.681
COMMERCIAL TRAITS AS AN

01:26:59.747 --> 01:27:01.382
ADDITIONAL STATE MEASURE -- TO

01:27:01.449 --> 01:27:03.051
MAKE SURE THAT THESE POPULATIONS

01:27:03.117 --> 01:27:05.320
NEVER GO BACK TO THE OLD DAYS --

01:27:05.386 --> 01:27:06.754
BUT BECAUSE THEY'RE INSIDE IT

01:27:06.821 --> 01:27:08.456
DOES NOT MEAN THEY'RE THREATENED

01:27:08.523 --> 01:27:09.691
OR AND THEN YOUR WHAT SO EVER.

01:27:09.757 --> 01:27:11.259
ALLIGATORS WERE THE LEAST THAT --

01:27:11.326 --> 01:27:12.894
IN THE SEVENTIES THAT THEY HAVE

01:27:12.961 --> 01:27:15.830
NOT BEEN IN DANGER -- ON A CAR

01:27:15.897 --> 01:27:16.965
NOT ENDANGERED OR THREATENED.

01:27:17.031 --> 01:27:18.099
SOTALK TO ME ABOUT THE

01:27:18.166 --> 01:27:18.967
ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT.

01:27:19.033 --> 01:27:20.935
WHAT IS ENDANGERED WHAT IS

01:27:21.002 --> 01:27:25.740
LISTED AS ENDANGERED CAN YOU

01:27:25.807 --> 01:27:28.943
ADDRESS THAT?

01:27:29.010 --> 01:27:30.278
A BILL OR WHAT HAS BEEN DELISTED

01:27:30.345 --> 01:27:33.481
OUR LEAD DRAMA DRESS ACCORDING.

01:27:33.548 --> 01:27:36.818
TO THE WHAT CONSTITUTES AN IN

01:27:36.884 --> 01:27:39.187
DYING COULD CROW IS ONE THAT THE

01:27:39.253 --> 01:27:40.355
POPULATION IS PLAYING HARLEY

01:27:40.421 --> 01:27:41.623
DEPLETED.

01:27:41.689 --> 01:27:43.358
THE ONE CITY IN THE COMBINATIONS

01:27:43.424 --> 01:27:45.727
OF COUNTRIES AND PRODUCTS THAT

01:27:45.793 --> 01:27:46.728
ARE.

01:27:46.794 --> 01:27:48.229
STILL CONSIDERED INDICTED.

01:27:48.296 --> 01:27:50.098
I WON SAID USUALLY HAVE NO

01:27:50.164 --> 01:27:52.033
COMMERCIAL VALUE AND DIED.

01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:53.868
DâN APPEARING TRIED IT'LL NONE

01:27:53.935 --> 01:27:54.702
OF THE TRIED AND SPECIES ARE

01:27:54.769 --> 01:27:56.371
EARLY.

01:27:56.437 --> 01:27:58.973
IN DYING FEED.

01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:01.075
H. THAT'S THE CHALLENGE FOR US

01:28:01.142 --> 01:28:02.543
IN THE CRIMINAL SPECIALIST

01:28:02.610 --> 01:28:04.145
GREATLY CHARITY GET THE

01:28:04.212 --> 01:28:06.614
INCENTIVES TO CONSERVE THE

01:28:06.681 --> 01:28:09.050
SPECIES THAT.

01:28:09.117 --> 01:28:10.451
ALL RIGHT SO I HAVE NOT A

01:28:10.518 --> 01:28:12.153
COMMERCIAL VALUE THAT NOBODY'S

01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:13.121
INTERESTED IN NINE OF THE INJURY

01:28:13.187 --> 01:28:14.489
AS YOU'RE INTERESTED IN WRITING

01:28:14.555 --> 01:28:15.990
ANY MONEY FOR THEM THEY THEY

01:28:16.057 --> 01:28:19.761
THEY IT'S A COMMANDER IS CAN

01:28:19.827 --> 01:28:22.630
UNDER MATT HEY I'LL BE A I'LL BE

01:28:22.697 --> 01:28:24.666
A GET THE RESOURCES.

01:28:24.732 --> 01:28:25.633
TO IT'S NOT THE ANIMALS THAT ARE

01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:27.769
IN TRIED THAT ARE THE PROBLEM

01:28:27.835 --> 01:28:28.069
[inaudible]

01:28:28.136 --> 01:28:29.871
REGULAR [inaudible]

01:28:29.937 --> 01:28:31.039
SO MAYBE.

01:28:31.105 --> 01:28:33.074
NOT SURE IF THE AUTHORS ARE ARE.

01:28:33.141 --> 01:28:33.708
THE BEST ANSWER THIS BUT MAYBE

01:28:33.775 --> 01:28:34.976
I'LL.

01:28:35.043 --> 01:28:35.543
DIRECTED TO YOU AND YOU CAN

01:28:35.610 --> 01:28:37.111
FIGURE OUT WAS THE BEST.

01:28:37.178 --> 01:28:39.614
WE SENT EXTENDED THE SUNSET AS

01:28:39.681 --> 01:28:41.215
IT WAS OF THE SPOKEN ABOUT HERE.

01:28:41.282 --> 01:28:42.850
AT TO WAIVE THE BAN ABOUT FOUR

01:28:42.917 --> 01:28:44.519
YEARS AGO AND HERE WE ARE ONCE

01:28:44.585 --> 01:28:45.887
AGAIN.

01:28:45.953 --> 01:28:47.755
CAN SOMEBODY TELL US WHAT THE

01:28:47.822 --> 01:28:49.090
IMPACT ON ALLIGATORS OR

01:28:49.157 --> 01:28:51.025
CROCODILES HAS BEEN.

01:28:51.092 --> 01:28:53.261
AND WHAT WOULD WHAT WE LEARNED.

01:28:53.327 --> 01:28:55.063
CAN ANYONE TELL US WHAT HAVE WE

01:28:55.129 --> 01:28:56.564
LEARNED.

01:28:56.631 --> 01:28:58.733
SO ALL I CAN ADDRESS SOME OF

01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:01.469
THAT SO -- SINCE THE LAST TIME

01:29:01.536 --> 01:29:03.071
THAT THE SONGS THAT WAS PASSED --

01:29:03.137 --> 01:29:05.239
AGAIN WE HAVE IT'S NOT ALWAYS

01:29:05.306 --> 01:29:06.541
THE BEST PRACTICE MANAGEMENT. TO

01:29:06.607 --> 01:29:07.508
ENSURE THAT THEY ARE BEEN TRADE

01:29:07.575 --> 01:29:10.244
AND HUMANE -- ON WELFARE -- OF

01:29:10.311 --> 01:29:11.145
THE ANIMAL SYSTEMS BEEN LOOKED

01:29:11.212 --> 01:29:14.048
AFTER -- THERE'S SLAUGHTER AND

01:29:14.115 --> 01:29:16.651
EUTHANASIA GUIDELINES -- THE

01:29:16.718 --> 01:29:17.218
HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN THE

01:29:17.285 --> 01:29:18.853
INDUSTRY ON A FIVE DAY AMERICAN

01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:19.520
THE TERM MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HAS

01:29:19.587 --> 01:29:20.988
INCLUDED SOME OF THOSE

01:29:21.055 --> 01:29:21.856
GUIDELINES WITHIN SOME OF THEIR

01:29:21.923 --> 01:29:22.557
OWN.

01:29:22.623 --> 01:29:24.659
OUR RECOMMENDATIONS -- THERE'S

01:29:24.726 --> 01:29:27.195
ONGOING SCIENTIFIC STUDIES --

01:29:27.261 --> 01:29:28.763
BYE BYE ALL USING THIS ON ON

01:29:28.830 --> 01:29:30.331
FLORIDA THAT ADDRESSES THE WILD

01:29:30.398 --> 01:29:31.666
POPULATIONS AS WELL AS DOING A

01:29:31.733 --> 01:29:33.701
RESEARCH STUDY ON THE HEALTH OF

01:29:33.768 --> 01:29:35.503
CAPTIVE ON WAS ON IT WAS OUR

01:29:35.570 --> 01:29:36.504
BEEN RELEASED TO THE WALL RIGHT

01:29:36.571 --> 01:29:38.439
NOW WE'RE CURRENTLY SOMETHING

01:29:38.506 --> 01:29:39.674
THE FOR THE SEASON TO MAKE SURE

01:29:39.741 --> 01:29:40.007
THAT I HAVE.

01:29:40.074 --> 01:29:41.008
AND THE THINGS THEY CAN AFFECT

01:29:41.075 --> 01:29:42.009
THE WALL POPULATION SOURCE MADE

01:29:42.076 --> 01:29:43.311
A BIG PUSH FOR SCIENTIFIC

01:29:43.377 --> 01:29:45.012
RESEARCH AND DATA TO MAKE SURE

01:29:45.079 --> 01:29:47.148
THE THAT A STATEMENT OR KNOW

01:29:47.215 --> 01:29:48.249
THAT FROM THE WALL POPULATION

01:29:48.316 --> 01:29:49.884
THE SITE IS NEEDS WHICH HAS

01:29:49.951 --> 01:29:50.718
ALWAYS BEEN THERE HAS ALWAYS

01:29:50.785 --> 01:29:51.085
BEEN APPROVED.

01:29:51.152 --> 01:29:52.653
THAT CONTINUES TO BE THE SAME

01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:54.722
WAY AND WE GOT IT ALL THE DATA

01:29:54.789 --> 01:29:55.123
TO SUPPORT THAT.

01:29:55.189 --> 01:29:56.958
THANK I THINK MISFIRING YOU ALSO

01:29:57.024 --> 01:29:59.694
HAD A RESPONSE -- YEAH WHY DID I

01:29:59.761 --> 01:30:00.361
KNOW -- WAS GOING TO SAY DID YOU

01:30:00.428 --> 01:30:01.028
DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE

01:30:01.095 --> 01:30:11.773
AUTHORS DID YOU WANT TO RESPOND

01:30:11.839 --> 01:30:14.208
TO THAT AT ALL.

01:30:14.275 --> 01:30:14.776
AND IF NOT WE CAN GO TO MISS

01:30:14.842 --> 01:30:16.944
HEARING.

01:30:17.011 --> 01:30:17.612
OKAY MISS PERIOD THANK YOU

01:30:17.678 --> 01:30:18.146
MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANTED

01:30:18.212 --> 01:30:18.780
OPPORTUNITY AGAIN I WOULD DRAW

01:30:18.846 --> 01:30:19.914
YOUR ATTENTION TO THE ANALYSIS

01:30:19.981 --> 01:30:20.481
WHICH I THINK SPECIFICALLY

01:30:20.548 --> 01:30:21.048
STATES THE CURRENT STATE OF

01:30:21.115 --> 01:30:21.816
AFFAIRS WITH RESPECT -- TO

01:30:21.883 --> 01:30:22.817
GLOBALLY HOW THE SPECIES ARE

01:30:22.884 --> 01:30:23.851
BEING HANDLED UNDER SADIE'S

01:30:23.918 --> 01:30:24.652
TWENTY OF THE TWENTY THREE

01:30:24.719 --> 01:30:25.253
SPECIES IN THE ORDER COCKATIEL

01:30:25.319 --> 01:30:26.387
YES SEVEN ARE ENDANGERED AND FOR

01:30:26.454 --> 01:30:27.188
OUR VULNERABLE ACCORDING TO THE

01:30:27.255 --> 01:30:28.022
IUCN RED LIST WHICH ASSESSES

01:30:28.089 --> 01:30:29.524
CONSERVATION STATUS OF SPECIES

01:30:29.590 --> 01:30:31.359
AT A GLOBAL LEVEL -- I WOULD

01:30:31.425 --> 01:30:33.728
ALSO POINT BACK AGAIN TO THE NEW

01:30:33.795 --> 01:30:34.762
REPORT THAT WE JUST ISSUED

01:30:34.829 --> 01:30:36.664
SHOWING ILLEGAL TRADE FROM LATIN

01:30:36.731 --> 01:30:39.000
AMERICA IN SPITE OF SOCIETIES IN

01:30:39.066 --> 01:30:40.701
SPITE OF PROTECTIONS WE ARE

01:30:40.768 --> 01:30:43.471
STILL FINDING A HUGE ILLEGAL

01:30:43.538 --> 01:30:44.906
WHILE LIVING TRAFFIC ILLEGAL

01:30:44.972 --> 01:30:46.007
WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING NETWORK AND

01:30:46.073 --> 01:30:47.909
THESE SPECIES ARE AMONG THE MOST

01:30:47.975 --> 01:30:48.676
SIGNIFICANT THAT.

01:30:48.743 --> 01:30:49.877
OUR TRAFFIC ILLEGALLY SO THAT'S

01:30:49.944 --> 01:30:52.313
IN VIOLATION OF CITIES AND OTHER

01:30:52.380 --> 01:30:55.249
LAWS EIGHTY PER 86% OF THE CAME

01:30:55.316 --> 01:30:56.484
IN ITEMS THAT WERE FOUND WERE

01:30:56.551 --> 01:30:59.153
SOURCE FROM THE WILD. 96% OF THE

01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:00.588
CROCODILE ITEMS ARE SOURCE FROM

01:31:00.655 --> 01:31:02.290
THE WILD SO TO THE EXTENT THAT

01:31:02.356 --> 01:31:03.624
THERE IS A LEGAL THERE IS A

01:31:03.691 --> 01:31:05.560
LEGAL COVER CREATED BY THE FARM

01:31:05.626 --> 01:31:09.363
TRADE AND FARM ANIMALS IT WILL

01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:11.566
CONTINUE TO DRIVE.

01:31:11.632 --> 01:31:12.700
DEMAND FROM THOSE PRODUCTS FROM

01:31:12.767 --> 01:31:13.334
ANIMALS THAT ARE IT RATE THAT

01:31:13.401 --> 01:31:13.901
ARE IN THE WILD AND IT WILL

01:31:13.968 --> 01:31:14.869
CONTINUE TO FOSTER THIS ILLEGAL

01:31:14.936 --> 01:31:16.537
TRAFFICKING ACROSS THE GLOBE

01:31:16.604 --> 01:31:17.939
WHICH IS THE THIRD LARGEST THE

01:31:18.005 --> 01:31:19.874
LEGAL INDUSTRY.

01:31:19.941 --> 01:31:21.008
AFTER GUNS AND DRUGS.

01:31:21.075 --> 01:31:23.311
BUT YOU HAVE TO ADMIT THAT THE

01:31:23.377 --> 01:31:24.378
LEGAL TRADE AND IN YOUR YOUR

01:31:24.445 --> 01:31:25.780
FRIEND OF THE ILLEGAL TRADE BUT

01:31:25.847 --> 01:31:28.049
THE LEGAL TRADE HAS LED TO THE

01:31:28.115 --> 01:31:29.483
REBOUNDING OF THE SPECIES IN

01:31:29.550 --> 01:31:31.319
AUSTRALIA IN THESE TWO STATES

01:31:31.385 --> 01:31:32.486
RIGHT WERE INTERESTED ON HOW

01:31:32.553 --> 01:31:34.388
THEY'RE DOING ON A GLOBAL LEVEL.

01:31:34.455 --> 01:31:35.456
AND AGAIN WE BAND OVER MY

01:31:35.523 --> 01:31:36.891
QUESTION TO YOU IS YOU HAVE TO

01:31:36.958 --> 01:31:38.359
ADMIT THAT THOSE THEY HAVE

01:31:38.426 --> 01:31:41.696
REBOUNDED IN FLORIDA LOUISIANA

01:31:41.762 --> 01:31:43.297
AND AUSTRALIA CORRECT.

01:31:43.364 --> 01:31:45.166
THAT'S NOT THE SAME I ADMIT THAT

01:31:45.233 --> 01:31:49.904
THEY SET THE CLAIM THAT THAT'S

01:31:49.971 --> 01:31:51.639
NOT THE SAME AS ALL THE NATIONAL

01:31:51.706 --> 01:31:52.974
FIND A WORRY THEMSELVES ABOUT.

01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:53.541
THE HOW ARE THE SPECIES ARE

01:31:53.608 --> 01:31:54.575
FARING ON A GLOBAL LEVEL AND IT

01:31:54.642 --> 01:31:56.777
IS IT IS IN THE INDISPUTABLE

01:31:56.844 --> 01:31:58.613
THAT A TRADE IN AN ANIMAL

01:31:58.679 --> 01:32:00.314
SPECIES WILL DRIVE THE TRADE IN

01:32:00.381 --> 01:32:00.882
THAT SPECIES REGARDLESS OF

01:32:00.948 --> 01:32:01.849
SOURCE.

01:32:01.916 --> 01:32:03.317
SO IF WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW

01:32:03.384 --> 01:32:04.952
THE SPECIES ARE DOING GLOBALLY

01:32:05.019 --> 01:32:06.954
AND CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE TAKING

01:32:07.021 --> 01:32:09.123
OUR SUNSET RESPONSIBILITIES

01:32:09.190 --> 01:32:10.124
SERIOUSLY AND CHECKING IN ON

01:32:10.191 --> 01:32:10.691
THIS.

01:32:10.758 --> 01:32:12.360
WE WOULD SUBMIT THAT THIS IS A

01:32:12.426 --> 01:32:13.561
BAD IDEA BECAUSE THERE IS

01:32:13.628 --> 01:32:15.229
SHOCKING EVIDENCE THAT THESE

01:32:15.296 --> 01:32:17.098
CONTINUES TO BE SPECIES THAT ARE

01:32:17.164 --> 01:32:18.132
TRADED ILLEGALLY AROUND THE

01:32:18.199 --> 01:32:19.100
GLOBE.

01:32:19.166 --> 01:32:20.001
CAUSING THEIR PERIL ONE ONE READ

01:32:20.067 --> 01:32:21.936
AND UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR POINT

01:32:22.003 --> 01:32:23.871
BUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS AND I

01:32:23.938 --> 01:32:25.172
DON'T THINK IT'S OUT HARD FOR

01:32:25.239 --> 01:32:27.041
YOU TO ADMIT IS THAT WHERE WE

01:32:27.108 --> 01:32:28.776
HAVE HAD LEGAL TRADE THAT IN

01:32:28.843 --> 01:32:30.511
THESE AREAS THE POPULATION HAS

01:32:30.578 --> 01:32:32.213
REBOUNDED SIGNIFICANTLY THOSE

01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:35.316
ARE THE FACTS.

01:32:35.383 --> 01:32:39.553
MISTER KALRA.

01:32:39.620 --> 01:32:40.221
NUMBER LOWERED OF FINISH UP WITH

01:32:40.288 --> 01:32:41.022
COMMENTS SUGGEST YES MISTER

01:32:41.088 --> 01:32:42.189
BIGELOW THANK YOU JUST ONE MORE

01:32:42.256 --> 01:32:42.823
AND I DON'T KNOW IF VIDEO ONCE

01:32:42.890 --> 01:32:43.591
AT THIS TABLE.

01:32:43.658 --> 01:32:45.593
BUT COULD SOMEONE ADDRESS THE

01:32:45.660 --> 01:32:46.928
COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE ABOUT

01:32:46.994 --> 01:32:49.630
THE GAINS IN TECHNOLOGY AND

01:32:49.697 --> 01:32:50.932
SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY.

01:32:50.998 --> 01:32:52.199
FROM THE ALLIGATORS AND

01:32:52.266 --> 01:32:56.137
CROCODILES AS WE KNOW HOW.

01:32:56.203 --> 01:32:58.139
THEY HAVE AN ODD AN IMMUNE

01:32:58.205 --> 01:32:59.173
SYSTEM.

01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:01.108
THAT DOES THAT.

01:33:01.175 --> 01:33:02.343
REQUIRE MEDICINE.

01:33:02.410 --> 01:33:04.345
THEY HEAL THEMSELVES.

01:33:04.412 --> 01:33:06.447
CAN SOMEONE ADDRESS THE FACT OF

01:33:06.514 --> 01:33:07.982
THE VALUE AND WHAT THAT

01:33:08.049 --> 01:33:09.517
POTENTIALLY MEANS TO US IN

01:33:09.583 --> 01:33:11.385
GAINES.

01:33:11.452 --> 01:33:13.921
IN THEEND FOR THE HUMAN SOCIETY

01:33:13.988 --> 01:33:15.156
WHAT WE CAN ACTUALLY.

01:33:15.222 --> 01:33:17.158
TRULY BENEFIT SINCE THE

01:33:17.224 --> 01:33:18.859
CROCODILES ARE ON A RECOVERY.

01:33:18.926 --> 01:33:20.328
THEY WERE ABLE TO CHAU

01:33:20.394 --> 01:33:22.296
SUSTAINABILITY.

01:33:22.363 --> 01:33:23.898
AND NOW HOW WE CAN USE

01:33:23.965 --> 01:33:24.198
[inaudible]

01:33:24.265 --> 01:33:27.234
SOME KNOWLEDGE TO ACTUALLY HEAL

01:33:27.301 --> 01:33:29.503
OURSELVES MAYBE IN FIND CURES TO

01:33:29.570 --> 01:33:32.473
THINGS THAT WE NEVER DREAMED UP.

01:33:32.540 --> 01:33:34.575
I CAN ADDRESS THAT AUSTIN SO ON

01:33:34.642 --> 01:33:35.943
THEIR SUCH AN EVENT TO GET ON

01:33:36.010 --> 01:33:37.211
THE SANTA MARK MERSHON THE HOUSE

01:33:37.278 --> 01:33:38.879
OF THE AMERICA THE WORK LOOKING

01:33:38.946 --> 01:33:40.314
AT THE ANTI MICROBIAL PROPERTIES

01:33:40.381 --> 01:33:42.516
OF THEIR BLOG -- THERE'S A

01:33:42.583 --> 01:33:44.385
NUMBER OF THIS TOGETHER YOU MAY

01:33:44.452 --> 01:33:45.820
JUST SPEAK INTO THE MICROPHONE

01:33:45.886 --> 01:33:46.554
TO SAID THAT -- NUMBER

01:33:46.620 --> 01:33:47.521
INVESTIGATORS IN THE STATE ONLY

01:33:47.588 --> 01:33:48.155
SEE ANOTHER LOOKING AT SOME OF

01:33:48.222 --> 01:33:49.190
THESE DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES

01:33:49.256 --> 01:33:49.890
LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE -- YOU KNOW

01:33:49.957 --> 01:33:51.058
BEING A MINOR SPACES HAS BEEN

01:33:51.125 --> 01:33:52.793
RECENTLY THAT ALL THOSE AVENUES

01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:53.327
HAVE BEEN LOOKED AT IN IN

01:33:53.394 --> 01:33:55.363
ALLIGATORS -- THERE'S BEEN

01:33:55.429 --> 01:33:56.430
SIMILAR RESEARCH CONDUCTED

01:33:56.497 --> 01:33:57.398
SADDAM ON THE FOR EXAMPLE THEY

01:33:57.465 --> 01:33:59.967
CAN REGENERATE LIMBS -- SO THE

01:34:00.034 --> 01:34:01.669
DODD BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH THAT'S

01:34:01.736 --> 01:34:02.970
CAUGHT IN ITS RESEARCH CUTTING

01:34:03.037 --> 01:34:03.871
EDGE SCIENCE -- WE'RE IN THE

01:34:03.938 --> 01:34:05.606
VERY VERY EARLY STAGES SO THAT

01:34:05.673 --> 01:34:06.240
WHEN IT COMES TO GROW WITH THE

01:34:06.307 --> 01:34:07.241
ALIENS RIGHT NOW -- THE

01:34:07.308 --> 01:34:08.776
PRELIMINARY DATA IT'S EXTREMELY

01:34:08.843 --> 01:34:10.611
PROMISING -- TO ANSWER A

01:34:10.678 --> 01:34:12.113
QUESTION WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO

01:34:12.179 --> 01:34:13.280
DO THAT WORK AND CONTINUE TO

01:34:13.347 --> 01:34:15.649
OPEN AVENUES FOR THAT TO HAPPEN

01:34:15.716 --> 01:34:16.617
SO WE DON'T HOLD BACK THAT

01:34:16.684 --> 01:34:18.719
DIVIDE MEDICAL RESEARCH AND

01:34:18.786 --> 01:34:19.387
DEVELOPMENT OF MEDICINE TO WHICH

01:34:19.453 --> 01:34:19.653
HE WANTS.

01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:20.654
SO WHEN YOU'RE DOING THAT

01:34:20.721 --> 01:34:21.989
RESEARCH YOU DON'T HAVE TO YOUTH

01:34:22.056 --> 01:34:24.392
AND ICE THOSE ANIMALS DO YOU.

01:34:24.458 --> 01:34:26.060
OUT FOR SOME OF THAT RESEARCH

01:34:26.127 --> 01:34:27.695
YES BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO HARVEST

01:34:27.762 --> 01:34:28.929
THE ORGANS OF THE EVENT ON THE

01:34:28.996 --> 01:34:30.231
RESEARCH AND SOME OF THOSE

01:34:30.297 --> 01:34:31.532
RESEARCH SITUATIONS THEY HAVE TO

01:34:31.599 --> 01:34:33.634
HARVEST THE FRIEND CELLS FROM

01:34:33.701 --> 01:34:34.301
THE ORGAN SO THEY HAD TO HAVE TO

01:34:34.368 --> 01:34:34.668
BE EUTHANIZED.

01:34:34.735 --> 01:34:36.170
IN SOME CASES IN SOME CASES IT

01:34:36.237 --> 01:34:38.205
NOT ALL CASES NOT ALL CASES

01:34:38.272 --> 01:34:38.873
CORRECT OKAY BECAUSE THAT WOULD

01:34:38.939 --> 01:34:49.817
BE A DONOR AND THAT WOULD BE.

01:34:49.884 --> 01:34:51.452
POTENTIALLY A SOURCE POINT.

01:34:51.519 --> 01:34:53.654
SO THAT'S A GOOD THING CORRECT

01:34:53.721 --> 01:34:55.056
ALL RIGHT.

01:34:55.122 --> 01:34:57.925
THANK YOU MISTER BIGELOW AS

01:34:57.992 --> 01:34:59.760
KATHY MISTER KALRA I THINK THIS

01:34:59.827 --> 01:35:02.396
YEAR -- I YOU KNOW I I DO WHEN

01:35:02.463 --> 01:35:04.298
I'M LOOKING AT FOR FOR COUPLE

01:35:04.365 --> 01:35:05.499
THINGS COMMITTEE IS HEARD OF A

01:35:05.566 --> 01:35:06.067
NUMBER OF THOSE ALREADY THE

01:35:06.133 --> 01:35:07.935
SESSION -- END OF THE LAST

01:35:08.002 --> 01:35:08.736
COUPLE YEARS THAT POINT TO A

01:35:08.803 --> 01:35:10.004
DIFFERENT DIRECTION AT LEAST OF

01:35:10.071 --> 01:35:11.705
THE MAJORITY -- HAS BEEN HEADING

01:35:11.772 --> 01:35:12.973
AND WE JUST HEARD AB FORTY FOUR

01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:15.676
RECENTLY -- BUT REGARDING OF THE

01:35:15.743 --> 01:35:17.078
FOR THE BANNING OF FOR A CERTAIN

01:35:17.144 --> 01:35:18.712
KINDS OF FOR WE HAD A BILL A

01:35:18.779 --> 01:35:19.346
LAST TO THE END OF THOSE A LOT

01:35:19.413 --> 01:35:20.414
OF CONVERSATION IN THIS

01:35:20.481 --> 01:35:22.016
COMMITTEE AS WELL AS SUBSEQUENT

01:35:22.083 --> 01:35:23.684
TO IT ON CHAU BE HUNTING AND WAS

01:35:23.751 --> 01:35:23.984
DIFFERENT.

01:35:24.051 --> 01:35:24.552
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHETHER

01:35:24.618 --> 01:35:26.454
CONSERVATION PROGRAMS ACTUALLY

01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:29.356
HELP -- VERSUS HUNTING PROGRAM

01:35:29.423 --> 01:35:32.259
SENDING LICENSES -- BUT HOW DO

01:35:32.326 --> 01:35:33.194
AS A VERSES ENVIRONMENTAL

01:35:33.260 --> 01:35:34.095
TOURISM -- AND WHAT HAS A

01:35:34.161 --> 01:35:37.298
GREATER IMPACT -- AND I THINK

01:35:37.364 --> 01:35:43.237
ULTIMATELY IT'S ABOUT.

01:35:43.304 --> 01:35:45.372
WHAT?

01:35:45.439 --> 01:35:46.507
CALIFORNIA VALLEY'S ARMOR OR CUT

01:35:46.574 --> 01:35:47.141
DIRECTION CALIFORNIA'S GOING IN

01:35:47.208 --> 01:35:47.775
AND I THINK THAT THIS COMMITTEE

01:35:47.842 --> 01:35:49.043
AND THE MEMBERS OF IT AGAIN NOT

01:35:49.110 --> 01:35:50.144
EVERYONE CLEARLY WE DEFINITELY

01:35:50.211 --> 01:35:50.978
HAVE VERY VIGOROUS DEBATE IT'S A

01:35:51.045 --> 01:35:52.613
GOOD THING THAT WE DO -- BUT I I

01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:53.581
THINK THIS COULD THIS COMMITTEE

01:35:53.647 --> 01:35:54.849
HAS A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION.

01:35:54.915 --> 01:35:56.383
AS TO THE DIRECTION THAT WE

01:35:56.450 --> 01:35:58.219
SHOULD BE GOING IN AND I LOOK AT

01:35:58.285 --> 01:35:59.687
THE ANALYSIS.

01:35:59.753 --> 01:36:01.689
YES THERE HAVE BEEN RESTORED

01:36:01.755 --> 01:36:03.257
POPULATIONS BUT WHY THOSE

01:36:03.324 --> 01:36:04.792
POPULATIONS NEEDED RESTORED

01:36:04.859 --> 01:36:06.193
BECAUSE IT WAS OVER HUNTING AND

01:36:06.260 --> 01:36:07.394
LOSS OF HABITAT.

01:36:07.461 --> 01:36:09.230
AND SO THAT'S WHY THERE WAS A

01:36:09.296 --> 01:36:10.464
PROBLEM TO BEGIN WITH.

01:36:10.531 --> 01:36:12.366
NOW THE POPULATIONS HAVE BEEN

01:36:12.433 --> 01:36:14.235
INCREASED AGAIN IF HUNTING IS

01:36:14.301 --> 01:36:15.569
CONTROLLED AND THE HABITATS

01:36:15.636 --> 01:36:17.571
PROTECTED THERE WON'T BE A NEED

01:36:17.638 --> 01:36:19.473
FOR THESE KINDS OF PROGRAMS.

01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:21.642
AND SO -- WITH THE EXCEPTION OF

01:36:21.709 --> 01:36:24.311
NUISANCE PERMITS -- SO THAT

01:36:24.378 --> 01:36:26.313
HUMAN POPULATIONS ARE ENDANGERED --

01:36:26.380 --> 01:36:28.115
NOW THERE'S NO REASON TO BELIEVE

01:36:28.182 --> 01:36:29.783
THAT THIS WILD ANIMAL WHICH NO

01:36:29.850 --> 01:36:30.451
ONE IS DISPUTING IS A WILD

01:36:30.518 --> 01:36:32.586
ANIMAL -- WILL CONTINUE TO

01:36:32.653 --> 01:36:34.755
THRIVE BECAUSE WHAT CAUSED ITS

01:36:34.822 --> 01:36:36.724
DEMISE WAS THE FACT THAT AS WAS

01:36:36.790 --> 01:36:37.925
MENTIONED -- BY SOME OF THE

01:36:37.992 --> 01:36:39.293
EXPERT TESTIMONY OVER DECADES

01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:40.294
DON'T REALLY CARE WHAT WAS

01:36:40.361 --> 01:36:41.962
HAPPENING THE ALLIGATOR.

01:36:42.029 --> 01:36:42.930
ALLIGATORS UNTIL THE ROUND THE

01:36:42.997 --> 01:36:44.798
SIXTIES AND THAT'S WHERE WE SAW

01:36:44.865 --> 01:36:45.933
THE DIP IN THE THE THE DRAMATIC

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.034
DIP IN THE POPULATION BECAUSE

01:36:47.101 --> 01:36:48.502
OVER HUNTING.

01:36:48.569 --> 01:36:49.837
AND SO OVER THE LAST SEVERAL

01:36:49.904 --> 01:36:50.871
DECADES AND AND DECIDE HE'S

01:36:50.938 --> 01:36:51.972
PROGRAM'S BEEN AROUND FOR

01:36:52.039 --> 01:36:53.107
DECADES THERE'S NOT A NEW THING

01:36:53.174 --> 01:36:54.608
SO PUTTING A LABEL SAYING THAT

01:36:54.675 --> 01:36:56.043
THERE'S APPROVED BY SITE IS WELL

01:36:56.110 --> 01:37:01.048
THAT'S BEEN THE CASE FOR MANY

01:37:01.115 --> 01:37:03.918
DECADES -- BUT MY MY BUT THE

01:37:03.984 --> 01:37:04.852
POINT BEING IS THAT THE ONLY

01:37:04.919 --> 01:37:05.319
REASON WHY THERE WAS A

01:37:05.386 --> 01:37:07.454
PREDICAMENT AND IS A PREDICAMENT.

01:37:07.521 --> 01:37:08.656
REGARDING -- IN SOME SOME AREAS

01:37:08.722 --> 01:37:09.657
OF THE WORLD THAT DON'T HAVE.

01:37:09.723 --> 01:37:12.626
OF THE THE DESIRE TO BE POPULATE --

01:37:12.693 --> 01:37:14.128
THERE'S BEEN A DESTINATION

01:37:14.195 --> 01:37:17.331
BECAUSE OF THE RETAIL DEMAND AND

01:37:17.398 --> 01:37:21.936
THE AND THE AND THE THE THE THE

01:37:22.002 --> 01:37:22.736
EXPORTING INTO.

01:37:22.803 --> 01:37:24.872
NATIONS LIKE THE US AND OTHER

01:37:24.939 --> 01:37:27.508
PLACES THAT HELLO BY THE THE

01:37:27.575 --> 01:37:29.376
RETAIL PRODUCTS.

01:37:29.443 --> 01:37:31.045
AND SO.

01:37:31.111 --> 01:37:32.580
I THINK BOTH IN TERMS OF

01:37:32.646 --> 01:37:33.881
PROTECTION OF THE SPECIES THIS

01:37:33.948 --> 01:37:35.516
IS TO SUGGEST THAT THE ONLY WITH

01:37:35.583 --> 01:37:36.984
THIS PIECE TO BE PROTECTED AS OF

01:37:37.051 --> 01:37:39.086
THIS PRACTICE CONTINUES EXIST.

01:37:39.153 --> 01:37:40.421
I'VE I I DON'T SEE THAT AS A AS

01:37:40.487 --> 01:37:41.155
A FACTUALLY CORRECT STATEMENT

01:37:41.222 --> 01:37:42.690
GIVEN THE FACT THAT.

01:37:42.756 --> 01:37:44.425
THE THE GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE

01:37:44.491 --> 01:37:46.160
NOW COULD PUT IN PLACE MUCH

01:37:46.227 --> 01:37:48.996
STRONGER HUNTING PROHIBITIONS WE

01:37:49.063 --> 01:37:50.064
COULD PUT IN PLACE.

01:37:50.130 --> 01:37:51.465
HABITAT PROTECTIONS AND THE

01:37:51.532 --> 01:37:54.602
LASTING ALSO ON HABITAT IS

01:37:54.668 --> 01:37:55.369
TWENTY SEVENTEEN SURVEY DOES

01:37:55.436 --> 01:37:56.737
INDICATE A DRAMATIC INCREASE

01:37:56.804 --> 01:37:58.739
THANKFULLY FOR THE NINETEEN

01:37:58.806 --> 01:37:59.306
SEVENTY ONE SURVEYS EXEMPT

01:37:59.373 --> 01:37:59.573
PERCENT.

01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:00.841
CLEARLY SHOWS THAT THE

01:38:00.908 --> 01:38:02.776
INTENTIONAL ACTIONS -- BUTTON

01:38:02.843 --> 01:38:03.777
THAT THAT WERE PUT IN PLACE BY

01:38:03.844 --> 01:38:06.914
LOUISIANA AND OF FLORIDA.

01:38:06.981 --> 01:38:09.550
APPARENTLY I HAD BEEN WORKING.

01:38:09.617 --> 01:38:12.886
BUT BUT IF YOU NOTICE A 12% DEPT

01:38:12.953 --> 01:38:13.087
DUE.

01:38:13.153 --> 01:38:14.822
TO TROPICAL STORM CINDY AND I

01:38:14.888 --> 01:38:16.824
MENTION THAT BECAUSE HABITAT AND

01:38:16.890 --> 01:38:17.758
THE PROTECTION HAPPEN HAS WILL

01:38:17.825 --> 01:38:18.959
BE MUCH MUCH MORE DIFFICULT I

01:38:19.026 --> 01:38:19.994
THINK WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON

01:38:20.060 --> 01:38:21.528
PROTECTION OF THE HABITAT.

01:38:21.595 --> 01:38:22.930
AND THE RESTAURANT AND AND NOW

01:38:22.997 --> 01:38:25.065
THE POPULATION'S BEEN RESTORED --

01:38:25.132 --> 01:38:26.500
CONTROLLING AND AND ENSURING

01:38:26.567 --> 01:38:28.769
THAT THERE'S NO HUNTING EXCEPT

01:38:28.836 --> 01:38:29.103
FOR NUISANCE.

01:38:29.169 --> 01:38:30.604
AT THOSE TWO THINGS ARE DONE I

01:38:30.671 --> 01:38:32.006
THINK THAT THE THE SUCCESS OF

01:38:32.072 --> 01:38:33.941
THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN REALIZED

01:38:34.008 --> 01:38:35.876
OVER ABOUT A HALF PERCENT FORTY

01:38:35.943 --> 01:38:36.777
TO FIFTY YEARS.

01:38:36.844 --> 01:38:37.878
AND I'M GRATEFUL TO THOSE THE

01:38:37.945 --> 01:38:39.079
INSTITUTE THE PROGRAM AND

01:38:39.146 --> 01:38:40.481
GRATEFUL TO THOSE THAT DID THE

01:38:40.547 --> 01:38:41.849
HARD WORK TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.

01:38:41.915 --> 01:38:43.417
BUT THERE'S NO NEED FOR

01:38:43.484 --> 01:38:46.487
CALIFORNIA -- TO DO ANYTHING BUT

01:38:46.553 --> 01:38:50.124
ALLOW OF THE ALLOW THE SUNSET

01:38:50.190 --> 01:38:50.691
TWENTY TWENTY AND LET'S MOVE

01:38:50.758 --> 01:38:51.892
FORWARD -- AS A STATE IN THAT

01:38:51.959 --> 01:38:52.993
DIRECTION SO I WILL WILL NOT BE

01:38:53.060 --> 01:38:54.028
SUPPORTING THE BILL THIS TIME IF

01:38:54.094 --> 01:38:55.863
THERE'S ANY FURTHER ELABORATION

01:38:55.929 --> 01:38:57.398
REGARDING THE ABSOLUTE NEED FOR

01:38:57.464 --> 01:39:00.100
MEDICINAL PURPOSES -- THEN THAT

01:39:00.167 --> 01:39:00.734
SHOULD BE THE FOCUS OF THE BILL

01:39:00.801 --> 01:39:02.770
AND WE CAN WE CAN TALK ABOUT

01:39:02.836 --> 01:39:10.477
THAT THANKS.

01:39:10.544 --> 01:39:12.713
MR GLORIA.

01:39:12.780 --> 01:39:13.547
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN --

APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION

01:39:14.682 --> 01:39:16.050
WHICH WE I THINK WE ALWAYS DO A

01:39:16.116 --> 01:39:16.717
BIT MORE BILL FACTOR AROUND HERE

01:39:16.784 --> 01:39:17.785
AND JUST PUSH THINGS ONE WAY OR

01:39:17.851 --> 01:39:18.419
THE OTHER BUT DON'T ACTUALLY OF

01:39:18.485 --> 01:39:19.620
A CONVERSATION.

01:39:19.687 --> 01:39:20.254
AND I APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE I

01:39:20.321 --> 01:39:20.921
FIND MYSELF -- BE ABLE TO RELATE

01:39:20.988 --> 01:39:21.555
TO BOTH SIDES OF THIS PARTICULAR

01:39:21.622 --> 01:39:23.691
ISSUE I APPRECIATE THE

01:39:23.757 --> 01:39:24.725
ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE AND WHICH WE

01:39:24.792 --> 01:39:25.592
SEEM TO BE A BARE MINIMUM FOR

01:39:25.659 --> 01:39:26.260
EVEN ENTERTAINING OF DISCUSSION.

01:39:26.327 --> 01:39:27.494
IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT

01:39:27.561 --> 01:39:28.062
WHATEVER EVER WAS IMPORTED

01:39:28.128 --> 01:39:30.064
FOLLOW THE STRICTEST OF OF OF

01:39:30.130 --> 01:39:30.631
RULES ALTHOUGH THIS HEARING

01:39:30.698 --> 01:39:32.166
MAKES A GOOD POINT ABOUT.

01:39:32.232 --> 01:39:33.100
THIS DOESN'T EVEN WITH THIS IN

01:39:33.167 --> 01:39:34.735
PLACE ARE STILL TREMENDOUS TRADE

01:39:34.802 --> 01:39:36.337
FOR WHICH WE SHOULD ALL HAVE

01:39:36.403 --> 01:39:36.870
CONCERN AND SHOULD NOT BE

01:39:36.937 --> 01:39:39.773
COMPLACENT -- THAT SAID -- I I

01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:41.008
THINK THERE'S OTHER SORTS OF

01:39:41.075 --> 01:39:42.242
METRICS THAT I THINK ARE WORTHY

01:39:42.309 --> 01:39:46.613
OF DISCUSSION OF AS WAS

01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:49.950
MENTIONED THAT THERE ARE.

01:39:50.017 --> 01:39:50.617
YOU LEARN THANK YOU THE GRADUATE

01:39:50.684 --> 01:39:51.552
SCHOOL READY TO LEARN SOMETHING

01:39:51.618 --> 01:39:54.054
NEW EVERY DAY RIGHT SO THERE'S

01:39:54.121 --> 01:39:56.590
TWENTY COMING HERE TWENTY THREE

01:39:56.657 --> 01:39:57.291
WAS IN THE CANADIAN HOUSES.

01:39:57.358 --> 01:39:58.425
DIFFERENT SPECIES OF ALLIGATOR

01:39:58.492 --> 01:39:59.360
SOME OF WHICH ARE IN DANGER SOME

01:39:59.426 --> 01:40:00.094
OF WHICH ARE AT RISK RIGHT.

01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:02.363
AND I WONDER WHY WE WOULD BE.

01:40:02.429 --> 01:40:02.996
FOR CONSISTENCY'S SAKE

01:40:03.063 --> 01:40:05.599
SUPPORTING THE IMPORTATION OF OF

01:40:05.666 --> 01:40:07.634
AT LEAST PORTIONS OF THIS -- OF

01:40:07.701 --> 01:40:09.136
CROCODILES AND ALLIGATORS THAT

01:40:09.203 --> 01:40:11.605
ARE ENDANGERED -- THAT THAT

01:40:11.672 --> 01:40:12.473
WOULD SEEM TO BE.

01:40:12.539 --> 01:40:13.607
NOT SOMETHING WE'D WANT TO

01:40:13.674 --> 01:40:15.442
SUPPORT IS CALIFORNIA ABOUT

01:40:15.509 --> 01:40:17.177
THEIR PORTIONS THAT ARE NOT --

01:40:17.244 --> 01:40:19.012
AT RISK IN THERE FOR MAYBE A

01:40:19.079 --> 01:40:20.781
MORE DYNAMIC THOUGHT IS IT IS

01:40:20.848 --> 01:40:21.749
WORTH WHILE THEY'RE DRIVING I

01:40:21.815 --> 01:40:23.083
STRUGGLE WITH IN TERMS OF THE

01:40:23.150 --> 01:40:24.418
COMMITTEE NOW SAYS I'VE

01:40:24.485 --> 01:40:25.686
CERTAINLY HEARD MENTION.

01:40:25.753 --> 01:40:27.621
OF THE THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS --

01:40:27.688 --> 01:40:29.656
OF ACROSS OF THIS SPECIES FOR

01:40:29.723 --> 01:40:32.993
HUMAN -- RESEARCH -- AND THERE

01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:34.228
ARE CERTAINLY FOLKS I LOOK TO ON

01:40:34.294 --> 01:40:35.429
THIS ISSUE CAME IN SUCCESSOR

01:40:35.496 --> 01:40:37.564
SUPPORT FOR THIS THAT'S NOT

01:40:37.631 --> 01:40:38.365
REFLECTED IN THE COMMITTEE

01:40:38.432 --> 01:40:40.868
ANALYSIS -- MY STAFF'S OF COURSE

01:40:40.934 --> 01:40:43.070
REVIEW REVIEW OF WAS TRYING TO

01:40:43.137 --> 01:40:45.305
FIND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION --

01:40:45.372 --> 01:40:47.040
SOME OF THE COMMENTS CRITICALLY

01:40:47.107 --> 01:40:48.842
FROM THE LOUISIANA DELEGATION --

01:40:48.909 --> 01:40:50.577
IN SUPPORT OF THIS PARTICULAR

01:40:50.644 --> 01:40:52.880
PIECE OF LEGISLATION REFERENCES --

01:40:52.946 --> 01:40:54.281
EATING WERE AT LOUISIANA

01:40:54.348 --> 01:40:55.549
LOUISIANA ALLIGATORS AND TALK

01:40:55.616 --> 01:40:57.117
ABOUT BAGS AND WALLETS BUT NOT

01:40:57.184 --> 01:40:58.952
TALKING ABOUT RESEARCH -- WHICH

01:40:59.019 --> 01:41:00.187
IS AN IMPEDIMENT FOR ME GETTING

01:41:00.254 --> 01:41:01.955
WHERE I'D LIKE TO BE OUR I THINK

01:41:02.022 --> 01:41:03.957
WE'RE SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO BE ON

01:41:04.024 --> 01:41:06.427
THIS BILL -- IT MY UNDERSTANDING

01:41:06.493 --> 01:41:08.061
IS THAT WE THE ALLIGATOR EGGS

01:41:08.128 --> 01:41:09.997
ARE PERHAPS MORE HELPFUL -- IN

01:41:10.063 --> 01:41:11.165
THERE PRETTY KEEP THERAPEUTIC

01:41:11.231 --> 01:41:13.367
USES -- AND I'M CONFUSED ABOUT

01:41:13.434 --> 01:41:14.768
WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE A THE

01:41:14.835 --> 01:41:16.103
IMPORTATION OF THE EGGS IS

01:41:16.170 --> 01:41:17.471
ALLOWED UNDER THE CURRENT BAND --

01:41:17.538 --> 01:41:23.177
IF IF THIS LEGISLATION WAS NOT

01:41:23.243 --> 01:41:25.879
PASSED. TO SOMEONE WHO MIGHT BE

01:41:25.946 --> 01:41:27.014
ABLE TO ANSWER THAT.

01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:28.081
PARTICULAR ISSUE THAT ARE THE

01:41:28.148 --> 01:41:30.851
ANIMAL A OR THE CROCODILE EGGS.

01:41:30.918 --> 01:41:31.852
BUT GETS IN A MORE EGGS ARE THE

01:41:31.919 --> 01:41:33.053
ONLY A THERAPEUTIC BENEFIT

01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:34.455
THAT'S HERE.

01:41:34.521 --> 01:41:35.088
I'VE SEEN THE SHAKING OF HEADS

01:41:35.155 --> 01:41:36.757
AND NOW NOW THAT ONE OF THE

01:41:36.824 --> 01:41:38.091
DOLLARS WILL BE CORRECT THAT THE

01:41:38.158 --> 01:41:39.493
THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS COME -- IN

01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:40.360
A LARGE PORTION FROM THE BLOOD

01:41:40.427 --> 01:41:41.829
OF THE ANIMALS THEMSELVES A LOOK

01:41:41.895 --> 01:41:43.063
AT A DIFFERENT ON THE BODIES AND

01:41:43.130 --> 01:41:43.997
DIFFERENT PROTEINS ARE IN THE

01:41:44.064 --> 01:41:45.232
BLOOD PRODUCT OF THE ANIMAL SO

01:41:45.299 --> 01:41:46.900
WOULDN'T BE JUST THE AG.

01:41:46.967 --> 01:41:47.868
IS THE BLOOD PROHIBITED UNDER

01:41:47.935 --> 01:41:50.437
THE BAN ON IS A PART OF THE ITEM

01:41:50.504 --> 01:41:52.105
ALSO IF I'M CORRECT US AS THE

01:41:52.172 --> 01:41:53.040
STATE NOW ANY PART.

01:41:53.106 --> 01:41:54.107
OF THE BODY OF THE ANIMAL WE

01:41:54.174 --> 01:41:55.843
PROHIBITED SO ON THEIR SITE IS

01:41:55.909 --> 01:41:57.644
FOR EXAMPLE BLOOD IS A PART OF

01:41:57.711 --> 01:42:03.550
THE ANIMAL SO YOU CAN EXPORT

01:42:03.617 --> 01:42:06.453
BLOT WITH A PERMITS -- IT CAN

01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:07.688
EITHER SPEAK.

01:42:07.754 --> 01:42:08.188
TO ANYTHING THERAPEUTIC

01:42:08.255 --> 01:42:08.489
[inaudible]

01:42:08.555 --> 01:42:11.658
WITH.

01:42:11.725 --> 01:42:12.993
IT IS I UNDERSTAND THE CURRENT

01:42:13.060 --> 01:42:14.394
BAND DOES NOT PROHIBIT -- LIVE

01:42:14.461 --> 01:42:16.129
BIG FROM BEING IMPORTED.

01:42:16.196 --> 01:42:18.232
OKAY SO EGGS ARE PERMITTED BUT

01:42:18.298 --> 01:42:19.399
THAT'S NOT THE ONLY QUESTION THE

01:42:19.466 --> 01:42:21.568
ANIMAL THAT COULD BE BENEFICIAL

01:42:21.635 --> 01:42:22.769
FOR HUMAN RESEARCH CORRECT AND A

01:42:22.836 --> 01:42:24.538
COPY OF WITH AXES IT DEPENDS ON

01:42:24.605 --> 01:42:26.006
THE AGE OF THE AG TO BECAUSE AT

01:42:26.073 --> 01:42:27.708
A CERTAIN AGE IS GOING TO BE A

01:42:27.774 --> 01:42:29.910
LIVE AMBER INSIDE THAT ACT.

01:42:29.977 --> 01:42:32.246
SO YOU HAVE A LIVE ANIMAL.

01:42:32.312 --> 01:42:33.447
JONATHAN LOUISIANA.

01:42:33.514 --> 01:42:34.882
ABOUT THIS DEGREE YEAH THANK YOU

01:42:34.948 --> 01:42:35.282
MISTER GALLAGHER.

01:42:35.349 --> 01:42:36.016
REGARDING THE THERAPEUTIC

01:42:36.083 --> 01:42:37.518
BENEFITS THEY'RE SIX TYPES OF

01:42:37.584 --> 01:42:38.785
THE EIGHT CAN DO DOES THAT IT

01:42:38.852 --> 01:42:41.221
TREATS -- WE CIRCULATED AROUND A

01:42:41.288 --> 01:42:42.289
PICTURE OF A PATIENT WHO HAD

01:42:42.356 --> 01:42:44.091
FLESH EATING BACTERIA CONSUMING

01:42:44.157 --> 01:42:46.026
HER NECK AND THE UPPER TORSO

01:42:46.093 --> 01:42:47.528
AREA AND WITHIN TWO MONTHS IT

01:42:47.594 --> 01:42:48.862
WAS TREATED WITH THE ALLIGATOR

01:42:48.929 --> 01:42:50.130
SELVES.

01:42:50.197 --> 01:42:55.369
AND IT WAS -- CURED AT THAT TIME --

01:42:55.435 --> 01:42:58.405
THERE'S HEPATITIS -- HIV WIND

01:42:58.472 --> 01:42:59.840
WAS TREATED AT AN IN VITRO LEVEL

01:42:59.907 --> 01:43:01.642
WERE KILLED 50% OF THE HIV VIRUS

01:43:01.708 --> 01:43:03.610
WITHIN ONE HOUR OF TREATMENT

01:43:03.677 --> 01:43:05.045
THAT'S STILL A LONG WAYS FROM AN

01:43:05.112 --> 01:43:07.881
ACTUAL -- SERUM HOWEVER -- IT IS

01:43:07.948 --> 01:43:10.417
PROMISING HERPES SIMPLEX ONE

01:43:10.484 --> 01:43:12.185
STAFF INFECTION MERCER HER ALSO

01:43:12.252 --> 01:43:13.520
TREATED WITH THIS RIGHT NOW

01:43:13.587 --> 01:43:15.322
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE IS LOOKING

01:43:15.389 --> 01:43:17.524
AT THIS AS A WOUND TREATMENT

01:43:17.591 --> 01:43:18.592
ALTERNATIVE FOR OUR VETERANS

01:43:18.659 --> 01:43:20.193
WERE IN AFGHANISTAN AND OTHER

01:43:20.260 --> 01:43:22.596
AREAS -- BECAUSE THE BACTERIA IS

01:43:22.663 --> 01:43:23.931
IN THOSE AREAS ARE ACTUALLY VERY

01:43:23.997 --> 01:43:25.499
DIFFICULT TO TREAT WITH

01:43:25.566 --> 01:43:27.668
TRADITIONAL ANTIBIOTICS -- THERE

01:43:27.734 --> 01:43:29.703
ARE ALSO TWO TYPES OF PNEUMONIAS

01:43:29.770 --> 01:43:31.338
WHICH ARE BEING TREATED --

01:43:31.405 --> 01:43:34.908
THERE'S ALSO OSTEOPOROSIS OUR

01:43:34.975 --> 01:43:36.410
OUR STORE OF THEIR IDEAS WHERE.

01:43:36.476 --> 01:43:38.278
THE CORTISONE TREATMENTS WHICH

01:43:38.345 --> 01:43:39.713
ARE TYPICALLY DETERIORATING

01:43:39.780 --> 01:43:41.915
TISSUE -- ARE NOT AFFECTED

01:43:41.982 --> 01:43:43.317
NEGATIVELY BY THE HYALURONIC

01:43:43.383 --> 01:43:45.018
ACID WITHIN THE ALLIGATOR

01:43:45.085 --> 01:43:45.886
MUSEUMS.

01:43:45.953 --> 01:43:47.421
SO THEY'RE ABOUT THIRTY EIGHT

01:43:47.487 --> 01:43:48.722
DIFFERENT TYPES OF HUMAN

01:43:48.789 --> 01:43:49.790
AILMENTS.

01:43:49.856 --> 01:43:51.291
THAT ARE PRESENTLY BEING LOOKED

01:43:51.358 --> 01:43:53.126
AT IN ADDITION TO REMOVING

01:43:53.193 --> 01:43:55.562
ANTIBIOTICS FROM AGRICULTURAL

01:43:55.629 --> 01:43:57.331
PRODUCTS LIKE SWINE IN COW THAT

01:43:57.397 --> 01:43:58.932
WOULD TRADITIONALLY REQUIRE

01:43:58.999 --> 01:43:59.866
ANTIBIOTICS.

01:43:59.933 --> 01:44:01.368
THEY NO LONGER DO BECAUSE THE

01:44:01.435 --> 01:44:02.803
ALLIGATOR PRODUCTS ARE IN THEIR

AGAINST THREATENED SPECIES

01:45:43.704 --> 01:45:45.806
OBVIOUSLY BEING USED AND THEN

01:45:45.872 --> 01:45:47.307

IN TERMS OF NARROWING.

01:47:28.108 --> 01:47:30.977

THIS IS THAT.

01:47:39.319 --> 01:47:41.788
THIS IS AN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT

01:47:41.855 --> 01:47:42.422
HAD BEEN CREATED.

01:47:42.489 --> 01:47:45.192
THAT HAS BROUGHT THE SPECIES

01:47:45.258 --> 01:47:45.892
BACK FROM THE BRINK OF

01:47:45.959 --> 01:47:48.094
EXTINCTION IN MANY AREAS -- IT

01:47:48.161 --> 01:47:49.663
IS.

01:47:49.729 --> 01:47:52.299
A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP.

01:47:52.365 --> 01:47:55.035
BETWEEN THE STATE OF LOUISIANA

01:47:55.101 --> 01:47:56.436

AND THEN RECOGNIZE THE

01:48:05.011 --> 01:48:06.146
THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS.

01:48:06.213 --> 01:48:08.148
THAT HAVE BEEN CREATED BECAUSE

01:48:08.215 --> 01:48:09.916
OF THIS PARTNERSHIP I THINK WE

01:48:09.983 --> 01:48:12.752

MY GOOD COLLEAGUE -- FROM THE

01:48:16.890 --> 01:48:19.259
SANTA CLARA REGION BUT BUT IF

01:48:20.727 --> 01:48:21.695
HARD TO GET TSN WHATEVER

01:48:21.761 --> 01:48:23.663
ADVISEMENT NEED TO ACCOMPANY THE

01:48:23.730 --> 01:48:26.233
PRODUCT -- WE'RE MORE THAN HAPPY

01:48:26.299 --> 01:48:26.633
TO HAVE.

01:48:26.700 --> 01:48:27.834

YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE COMPLYING

01:48:34.140 --> 01:48:36.142
WITH WITH SITE IS AND THAT YEAR

01:48:36.209 --> 01:48:37.878
THAT'D BE IS ECOLOGICALLY

01:48:37.944 --> 01:48:40.013
SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES THAT IT

01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:43.783
THAT HAVE BEEN -- A PART OF OF

01:48:43.850 --> 01:48:47.087
THE OF THE DEVELOPMENT.

01:48:47.153 --> 01:48:50.423
AT THE OF THE PRODUCT AND SO.

01:48:50.490 --> 01:48:52.659
I GUESS WHAT I A RESEARCHER SANE --

01:48:52.726 --> 01:48:54.294
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A RECOGNITION

01:48:54.361 --> 01:48:56.463
OF THE OF THE RESURGENCE OF THIS

01:48:56.529 --> 01:48:58.431
SPECIES GIVEN SOME OF THIS TO

01:48:58.498 --> 01:49:00.667
THE SENATE SHOULD SHOULD BE ABLE.

01:49:00.734 --> 01:49:01.801
TO TO THIS BUT YOU KNOW COULD

01:49:01.868 --> 01:49:04.738
COULD YOU LIMITED TO THE NON --

01:49:04.804 --> 01:49:06.940
IN DANGER NON VULNERABLE SPECIES

01:49:07.007 --> 01:49:07.440
IS THAT EVEN TECHNICALLY

01:49:07.507 --> 01:49:09.876
POSSIBLE COULD WE PROHIBIT THE

01:49:09.943 --> 01:49:14.681
IMPORTATION FOR COSMETIC AND AND

01:49:14.748 --> 01:49:16.182
FASHION USES WHICH ARE.

01:49:16.249 --> 01:49:18.585
KIND OF BACKWARDS IN MY OPINION --

01:49:18.652 --> 01:49:21.021
LIMITED TO HIM AND INVESTMENT

01:49:21.087 --> 01:49:21.955
FOR LIFESAVING THERAPIES I MEAN

01:49:22.022 --> 01:49:22.989
THESE THE THAT THOSE ARE THE

01:49:23.056 --> 01:49:24.324
KINDS OF THINGS I THINK.

01:49:24.391 --> 01:49:25.392
AT LEAST SPEAK TO ME I WANT TO

01:49:25.458 --> 01:49:26.359
BE FOR THE WHOLE COMMITTEE BUT I

01:49:26.426 --> 01:49:28.662
I THINK THAT THAT'S DIFFERENT

01:49:28.728 --> 01:49:29.429
THAN IMPORTED SUBMITS ITS

01:49:29.496 --> 01:49:30.497
ENDANGERED SO SOMEONE CAN HAVE A

01:49:30.563 --> 01:49:32.198
NEW BAG THAT'S NOT SOMETHING I

01:49:32.265 --> 01:49:33.700
CAN SUPPORT.

01:49:33.767 --> 01:49:34.701
RIGHT WELL THE ENDANGERED.

01:49:34.768 --> 01:49:36.436
UP PART OF IT IT THERE'S NO

01:49:36.503 --> 01:49:37.904
QUESTION AT ALL I DON'T THINK IT

01:49:37.971 --> 01:49:38.738
I MEAN THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT

01:49:38.805 --> 01:49:40.106
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BUT BUT IF

01:49:40.173 --> 01:49:41.308
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT NARROWING

01:49:41.374 --> 01:49:42.976
IT ONLY TO MEDICAL RESEARCH WE

01:49:43.043 --> 01:49:44.878
HAVE TO TAKE THAT BACK TO THE

01:49:44.945 --> 01:49:45.679
SPONSORS AND HAVE A CONVERSATION

01:49:45.745 --> 01:49:46.313
WITH THEM.

01:49:46.379 --> 01:49:47.113
AND I THINK THAT IS INTENT OF

01:49:47.180 --> 01:49:50.116
THEIR AMENDMENT IS TO STATE IN

01:49:50.183 --> 01:49:51.484
THERE AND HAD AND I KNOW.

01:49:51.551 --> 01:49:52.118
FOR ME -- PROBABLY WANT TO HAVE

01:49:52.185 --> 01:49:54.521
EVEN STRONGER LANGUAGE BUT THE

01:49:54.587 --> 01:49:56.022
INTENT IS TO ENSURE THAT.

01:49:56.089 --> 01:49:57.390
NOTHING COULD BE IMPORTED THAT

01:49:57.457 --> 01:49:58.458
WOULD BE A THREATENED SPECIES

01:49:58.525 --> 01:49:59.092
BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE

01:49:59.159 --> 01:50:02.195
IMPERMISSIBLE UNDER SIDE EAST OF

01:50:02.262 --> 01:50:06.132
THE TREATY.

01:50:06.199 --> 01:50:09.536
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S THIS

01:50:09.602 --> 01:50:10.870
HEARING DID YOU HEAR WELL I JUST

01:50:10.937 --> 01:50:11.604
MENTION NIGHT.

01:50:11.671 --> 01:50:12.939
AMERICAN ALLIGATORS ARE LISTED

01:50:13.006 --> 01:50:14.174
UNDER THE FEDERAL ESA AS A

01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:17.043
LOOKALIKE SPECIES OUT OF THE

01:50:17.110 --> 01:50:17.610
THINGS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT

01:50:17.677 --> 01:50:19.946
WHAT SO.

01:50:20.013 --> 01:50:21.915
WHAT IS ANY LOOKALIKES THERE IF

01:50:21.982 --> 01:50:22.349
YOU?

01:50:22.415 --> 01:50:23.650
MEANING THEY LOOK ALIKE ENOUGH

01:50:23.717 --> 01:50:24.884
LIKE THAT THE LISTED SPECIES

01:50:24.951 --> 01:50:26.453
THAT THEY'RE PROTECTED FROM

01:50:26.519 --> 01:50:26.987
THERE THEY ARE LISTED AS

01:50:27.053 --> 01:50:27.854
THREATENED BECAUSE THEY ARE

01:50:27.921 --> 01:50:28.722
TRADE WOULD IMPACT ADVERSELY

01:50:28.788 --> 01:50:29.522
SPECIES THAT THEY LOOK ALIKE

01:50:29.589 --> 01:50:30.223
BECAUSE THEY CANNOT BE THE

01:50:30.290 --> 01:50:31.391
DIFFERENCE CANNOT BE TOLD.

01:50:31.458 --> 01:50:33.393
SO EVEN IF YOU HAD A DOWN THIS

01:50:33.460 --> 01:50:34.761
ROAD IF THEY'RE RAISING A FARM

01:50:34.828 --> 01:50:37.530
DIVERSION OF A SPECIES THAT'S

01:50:37.597 --> 01:50:38.498
LISTED UNDER THE ESSAY THAT

01:50:38.565 --> 01:50:39.432
WOULD NOT BEEN WE DID WHAT YOU

01:50:39.499 --> 01:50:40.600
SUGGESTED.

01:50:40.667 --> 01:50:42.769
THAT WOULD PROHIBIT THE SALE OF

01:50:42.836 --> 01:50:43.970
THE SPECIES THEIR RATING

01:50:44.037 --> 01:50:45.405
REGARDLESS OF ITS SOURCE.

01:50:45.472 --> 01:50:47.240
SO EVEN IT'S NOT ENDANGERED IT

01:50:47.307 --> 01:50:49.409
HAPPENS TO LOOK LIKE IT'S IN

01:50:49.476 --> 01:50:51.478
DANGER SO THERE ARE QUITE A LOT

01:50:51.544 --> 01:50:52.145
OF OUR FACILITY BECAUSE IT IS.

01:50:52.212 --> 01:50:53.213
IT'S CONSIDERED BY THE FEDERAL

01:50:53.279 --> 01:50:54.614
GOVERNMENT TO CREATE THAT ITS

01:50:54.681 --> 01:50:56.216
TRADE CREATES ENOUGH OF A

01:50:56.282 --> 01:50:58.418
PROBLEM FOR SPECIES THAT IT

01:50:58.485 --> 01:51:02.522
LOOKS LIKE THAT IT.

01:51:02.589 --> 01:51:05.325
TOO IS LISTED.

01:51:05.392 --> 01:51:06.226
I THINK I UNDERSTAND.

01:51:06.292 --> 01:51:07.093
SINCE AND I AM SO BASICALLY

01:51:07.160 --> 01:51:08.395
UNDER THE LAW RIGHT NOW UNDER

01:51:08.461 --> 01:51:09.462
THE TREATY AND THAT THIS IS

01:51:09.529 --> 01:51:10.096
STATED IN THE ANALYSIS ELSEWHERE

01:51:10.163 --> 01:51:13.933
IT IS ILLEGAL. TO IMPORT

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:14.734
THREATENED SPECIES.

01:51:14.801 --> 01:51:16.536
INTO THE UNITED STATES WE ALSO

01:51:16.603 --> 01:51:17.570
HAVE.

01:51:17.637 --> 01:51:18.838
THE US FISH AND WILDLIFE

01:51:18.905 --> 01:51:21.541
ACTUALLY DOES DNA TESTING. TO

01:51:21.608 --> 01:51:22.575
ENSURE THAT IT IS NOT A

01:51:22.642 --> 01:51:24.411
THREATENED SPECIES WHEN IT WHEN

IT COMES IN -- SO THERE.

01:51:26.980 --> 01:51:28.148
SO THAT IS A LEGAL I THINK WHAT

01:51:28.214 --> 01:51:30.116
MISS FEARING A SANE THERE STILL

01:51:30.183 --> 01:51:31.618
ISN'T A LEGAL TRADE THAT GOES ON

01:51:31.684 --> 01:51:32.685

BANNING THINGS ARE SCORES SAYING

01:51:35.922 --> 01:51:37.023
THIS IS PROHIBITED.

01:51:37.090 --> 01:51:38.124
BUT THEY'RE STILL PEOPLE OUT

01:51:38.191 --> 01:51:40.093
THERE THERE ARE BAD ACTORS WHO

01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:43.563
ARE BASICALLY BREAKING THE LAW

01:51:43.630 --> 01:51:45.031
ANYWAY RIGHT.

01:51:45.098 --> 01:51:45.965
AS BUT UNDER THE LAW AND UNDER

THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE BY

01:57:21.534 --> 01:57:23.136
SETTING IN PLACE A REQUIREMENT

01:57:23.202 --> 01:57:24.937
THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND

01:57:25.004 --> 01:57:27.206
WILDLIFE DEVELOP ACOMPREHENSIVE

01:57:27.273 --> 01:57:28.941
BOBCAT MANAGEMENT PLAN.

01:57:29.008 --> 01:57:30.276
THAT AMONG OTHER THINGS WILL

01:57:30.343 --> 01:57:32.512
INCLUDE AN UPDATED STATEWIDE

01:57:32.578 --> 01:57:33.980
POPULATION ESTIMATES.

01:57:34.046 --> 01:57:35.681
THE LAST BOBCAT POPULATION

01:57:35.748 --> 01:57:37.350
ASSESSMENT IN CALIFORNIA IS MORE

01:57:37.417 --> 01:57:39.018
THAN THIRTY YEARS OLD AND IS

01:57:39.085 --> 01:57:41.387
DATED AND LIKELY INACCURATE.

01:57:41.454 --> 01:57:43.189
BECAUSE THE ASSESSMENT SO DATED

01:57:43.256 --> 01:57:44.724
IT FAILS TO REFLECT THE CURRENT

01:57:44.791 --> 01:57:46.526
SCIENTIFIC METHODS FOR ASSESSING

01:57:46.592 --> 01:57:48.361
AND MONITORING THE OVERALL

01:57:48.428 --> 01:57:50.530
HEALTH IN TREND OF THE STATEWIDE

01:57:50.596 --> 01:57:51.597
POPULATION.

01:57:51.664 --> 01:57:52.999
ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS OF THIS

01:57:53.065 --> 01:57:54.467
BILL REQUIRE THE FISH AND GAME

01:57:54.534 --> 01:57:55.635
COMMISSION TO CONSIDER THE

01:57:55.701 --> 01:57:56.936
EFFECTS OF TROPHY HUNTING

01:57:57.003 --> 01:57:58.104
BOBCATS.

01:57:58.171 --> 01:57:59.906
INCLUDING AFFECTS ON THEIR PREY

01:57:59.972 --> 01:58:02.008
DISEASE ABATEMENT AND CONTROL OF

01:58:02.074 --> 01:58:04.110
INVASIVE SPECIES SUCH AS THE

01:58:04.177 --> 01:58:07.180
NUTRIA RATS PRIOR TO RE OPENING

01:58:07.246 --> 01:58:09.515
A BOBCAT HUNTING SEASON.

01:58:09.582 --> 01:58:10.817
LACKING NO RELIABLE A RECENT

01:58:10.883 --> 01:58:11.784
ESTIMATE OF THE CURRENT

01:58:11.851 --> 01:58:13.786
STATEWIDE POPULATION IT'S COMMON

01:58:13.853 --> 01:58:14.754
SENSE TO PUT AN END TO THIS

01:58:14.821 --> 01:58:16.789
KILLING UNTIL THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:58:16.856 --> 01:58:18.291
FISH AND WILDLIFE COMPLETES

01:58:18.357 --> 01:58:20.259
EXTENSIVE ANALYSES.

01:58:20.326 --> 01:58:22.762
SHOWING YHO BEHIND OF BOBCATS

01:58:22.829 --> 01:58:24.030
NEEDS TO CONTINUE.

01:58:24.096 --> 01:58:25.465
TROPHY HUNTING.

01:58:25.531 --> 01:58:27.266
PRO TROPHY HUNTING ENTHUSIASTS

01:58:27.333 --> 01:58:30.736
CANNOT ARGUE THAT DECISIONS NEED

01:58:30.803 --> 01:58:32.672
SCIENCE BUT THEN ARGUE AGAINST

01:58:32.738 --> 01:58:34.006
LEGISLATION THAT WOULD MANDATE

01:58:34.073 --> 01:58:36.542
THE GATHERING OF THAT EXACT

01:58:36.609 --> 01:58:38.311
SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION.

01:58:38.377 --> 01:58:40.413
ADDITIONALLY BOBCAT TAX COST A

01:58:40.480 --> 01:58:42.248
MERE THREE DOLLARS AND TWENTY

01:58:42.315 --> 01:58:43.282
FOUR CENTS BARELY MAKING A

01:58:43.349 --> 01:58:45.151
CONTRIBUTION TO THE DEPARTMENT

01:58:45.218 --> 01:58:46.118
OF FISH AND WILDLIFE.

01:58:46.185 --> 01:58:47.620
LESS THAN FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:58:47.687 --> 01:58:49.255
ANNUALLY THAT IS LESS THAN THE

01:58:49.322 --> 01:58:52.225
SALARY OF A SINGLE GAME WARDEN.

01:58:52.291 --> 01:58:54.093
I RESPECTFULLY URGE AN AYE VOTE

01:58:54.160 --> 01:58:56.062
ON AB TWELVE FIFTY FOUR AND HERE

01:58:56.128 --> 01:58:57.530
WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IS

01:58:57.597 --> 01:58:59.432
WENDY KEEP OVER FROM THE HUMANE

YOU DID YOU SAY ARE YOU TAKING

01:59:04.837 --> 01:59:06.572
THE AMENDMENTS YES OKAY.

01:59:06.639 --> 01:59:07.540
THERE AND AGAIN WE'RE TRYING TO

01:59:07.607 --> 01:59:09.842
MINUTES EACH SO LET'S TRY AND

01:59:09.909 --> 01:59:11.511
STAY ON TRACK.

01:59:11.577 --> 01:59:13.646
I'M I'M WENDY KEEP OVER I'M THAT.

01:59:13.713 --> 01:59:14.213
NATIVE CARNIVORE PROTECTION

01:59:14.280 --> 01:59:16.482
MANAGER FOR THE HUMANE SOCIETY

01:59:16.549 --> 01:59:18.017
OF THEN AND UNITED STATES GOOD

01:59:18.084 --> 01:59:19.652
MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND

01:59:19.719 --> 01:59:21.954
COMMITTEES -- THANK YOU ON

01:59:22.021 --> 01:59:23.589
BEHALF OF THE HUMANE SOCIETY OF

01:59:23.656 --> 01:59:24.323
THE UNITED STATES AND OUR

01:59:24.390 --> 01:59:25.958
CALIFORNIA SUPPORTERS I THANK

01:59:26.025 --> 01:59:27.560
YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO

01:59:27.627 --> 01:59:28.594
TESTIFY.

01:59:28.661 --> 01:59:32.031
IN SUPPORT OF TWELVE FIFTY FOUR

01:59:32.098 --> 01:59:33.933
CALIFORNIA'S ICONIC BOBCATS HAVE

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:35.234
BEEN AFFORDED SOME PROTECTIONS

01:59:35.301 --> 01:59:36.836
IN RECENT YEARS.

01:59:36.903 --> 01:59:39.605
YET HUNTER STILL CUT A KILL

01:59:39.672 --> 01:59:41.207
HUNDREDS OF THEM ANNUALLY FOR

01:59:41.274 --> 01:59:43.142
NOTHING MORE THAN A TROPHY OR

01:59:43.209 --> 01:59:44.977
FOR THEIR FUR PELTS.

01:59:45.044 --> 01:59:46.078
AND THOSE FOR PELZER OFTEN

01:59:46.145 --> 01:59:47.680
SHIPPED OVERSEAS MARKETS IT'S

01:59:47.747 --> 01:59:49.749
TIME IN CALIFORNIA TO CLOSE THE

01:59:49.815 --> 01:59:52.318
LOOP AND PUT A MORATORIUM ON

01:59:52.385 --> 01:59:54.220
TROPHY HUNTING CALIFORNIA'S

01:59:54.287 --> 01:59:55.855
SMALLEST WILD CATS WHO ARE

01:59:55.922 --> 01:59:59.191
HIGHLY SENTIENT AND HOLD

01:59:59.258 --> 02:00:00.393
INTRINSIC VALUES.

02:00:00.459 --> 02:00:02.194
BOBCATS PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN

02:00:02.261 --> 02:00:03.563
BALANCING THE HEALTH OF THEIR

02:00:03.629 --> 02:00:05.064
INCOME SYSTEMS THEY PREY UPON

02:00:05.131 --> 02:00:08.134
RODENTS RABBITS INVASIVE NUTRIA

02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:10.403
WHICH IN TURN BENEFIT FARMERS

02:00:10.469 --> 02:00:12.038
AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES.

02:00:12.104 --> 02:00:13.506
SO I JUST LOOK THIS UP NUTRIA

02:00:13.573 --> 02:00:15.841
CAN PRODUCE THREE LITTERS A YEAR

02:00:15.908 --> 02:00:18.911
IN UP TO TWELVE KIDS PER LITTER --

02:00:18.978 --> 02:00:21.047
NUTRIA HARM CROPS WETLANDS

02:00:21.113 --> 02:00:23.716
ECOSYSTEMS AND EVEN HUMAN HEALTH

02:00:23.783 --> 02:00:26.552
ON THE OTHER HAND BOBCATS ARE

02:00:26.619 --> 02:00:28.421
VERY SLOW TO REPRODUCE --

02:00:28.487 --> 02:00:29.488
THEY'RE VERY AND THEY'RE

02:00:29.555 --> 02:00:31.857
INCREDIBLY RARE IT'S EXCITING TO

02:00:31.924 --> 02:00:34.760
SPOT WHEN IN THE WILD AND 74% OF

02:00:34.827 --> 02:00:37.363
CALIFORNIANS WOULD VALUE THAT

02:00:37.430 --> 02:00:39.365
OPPORTUNITY TO SEE A WILD BOBCAT

02:00:39.432 --> 02:00:41.267
WE JUST DID A POLL -- EARLIER

02:00:41.334 --> 02:00:42.802
LIKE LAST WEEK.

02:00:42.868 --> 02:00:46.305
AND THAT'S WHAT WHAT CAME OUT OF

02:00:46.372 --> 02:00:49.308
THAT 74%. 74% CALIFORNIA'S WANNA

02:00:49.375 --> 02:00:50.943
SEE OR A BOBCAT IN THE WILD.

02:00:51.010 --> 02:00:52.511
SO BOB CAT NUMBERS ARE KEPT IN

02:00:52.578 --> 02:00:55.514
CHECK BY A NUMBER OF OF FORCES.

02:00:55.581 --> 02:00:58.751
THEY THEY ARE PREYED UPON.

02:00:58.818 --> 02:01:00.820
BY OTHER CARNIVORES THEY FACE

02:01:00.886 --> 02:01:02.088
COMPETITION FROM OTHER

02:01:02.154 --> 02:01:04.557
CARNIVORES SUCH AS COYOTES AND

02:01:04.624 --> 02:01:06.192
MOUNTAIN LIONS AND ALSO THE

02:01:06.258 --> 02:01:08.661
NUMBER OF PREY REGULATES THE

02:01:08.728 --> 02:01:10.696
NUMBERS OF PREDATORS -- JUST

02:01:10.763 --> 02:01:12.531
LIKE WITH ANY CO SYSTEM SO YOU

02:01:12.598 --> 02:01:14.066
MEMBER THE CLASSIC A SNOWSHOE

02:01:14.133 --> 02:01:17.236
HARE AND THE LINKS -- MODEL SO

02:01:17.303 --> 02:01:19.271
BOBCATS ALSO FACED ADDITIONAL

02:01:19.338 --> 02:01:20.973
THREATS IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING

02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:22.608
LOSS OF HABITAT FROM URBAN

02:01:22.675 --> 02:01:24.944
SPRAWL AND OF COURSE THE RECENT

02:01:25.011 --> 02:01:26.445
DEADLY FIRES AND FOR THESE

02:01:26.512 --> 02:01:28.714
REASONS BOB CATS DON'T NEED TO

02:01:28.781 --> 02:01:30.249
BE TROPHY HUNTING.

02:01:30.316 --> 02:01:31.517
HUNTED PART ME.

02:01:31.584 --> 02:01:33.085
TROPHY HUNTING SIMPLY PUTS

02:01:33.152 --> 02:01:34.954
UNNECESSARY ADDITIONAL PRESSURE

02:01:35.021 --> 02:01:37.056
ON THEIR POPULATIONS WHICH HAS

02:01:37.123 --> 02:01:38.958
NOT BEEN STUDIED IN OVER THREE

02:01:39.025 --> 02:01:40.126
DECADES.

02:01:40.192 --> 02:01:41.494
AND AS ASSEMBLY WOMAN MENTIONED

02:01:41.560 --> 02:01:43.462
THIS LEGISLATION SUPPORTS THE

02:01:43.529 --> 02:01:44.664
USE OF SOUND SCIENCE BY

02:01:44.730 --> 02:01:45.931
REQUIRING THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:01:45.998 --> 02:01:47.867
WILDLIFE DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE

02:01:47.933 --> 02:01:50.202
MUCH A BOBCAT MANAGEMENT PLAN.

02:01:50.269 --> 02:01:52.304
THAT AMONG OTHER THINGS ASSESSES

02:01:52.371 --> 02:01:54.173
THEIR POPULATION USING THE BEST

02:01:54.240 --> 02:01:55.675
AVAILABLE SCIENCE.

02:01:55.741 --> 02:01:58.010
AND REPLACES THE OUTDATED THIRTY

02:01:58.077 --> 02:01:59.545
FIVE YEAR OLD ASSESSMENT.

02:01:59.612 --> 02:02:00.780
IT ALSO REQUIRES THAT THE

02:02:00.846 --> 02:02:02.648
DEPARTMENT OF A LOOK AT THE

02:02:02.715 --> 02:02:04.850
HOLISTIC AFFECTS OF TROPHY

02:02:04.917 --> 02:02:06.252
HUNTING BOBCATS NOT JUST ON

02:02:06.318 --> 02:02:08.287
THEIR OWN POPULATIONS BUT ALSO

02:02:08.354 --> 02:02:11.057
ON PREY AND INVASIVE SPECIES CAN.

02:02:11.123 --> 02:02:13.192
CONTROL.

02:02:13.259 --> 02:02:15.394

02:02:15.461 --> 02:02:16.595

02:13:17.356 --> 02:13:19.991
WHY ARE YOU?

02:13:20.058 --> 02:13:20.992
TAKING AN ACTION TO OUT RIGHT DO

02:13:21.059 --> 02:13:23.428
A MORATORIUM WHEN THERE IS --

02:13:23.495 --> 02:13:25.230
STUDIES THAT NEED TO BE DONE TO

02:13:25.297 --> 02:13:26.998
MAY BE JUSTIFIED DOING A

02:13:27.065 --> 02:13:27.899
MORATORIUM.

02:13:27.966 --> 02:13:33.205
SO I WILL LET.

02:13:33.271 --> 02:13:34.106
ALL THIS ADDED THAT REALLY

02:13:34.172 --> 02:13:35.707
QUICKLY BECAUSE I I THINK THAT'S

02:13:35.774 --> 02:13:36.341
AN IMPORTANT POINT I HAVE BEEN

02:13:36.408 --> 02:13:37.909
HERE THE SO IT WAS MENTIONED

02:13:37.976 --> 02:13:40.011
EARLY THREE THREE HUNDRED THIRTY

02:13:40.078 --> 02:13:41.213
ONE BOBCATS WERE TAKEN.

02:13:41.279 --> 02:13:42.948
IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN

02:13:43.014 --> 02:13:45.350
YEAR. TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE IN

02:13:45.417 --> 02:13:47.519
THE TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN

02:13:47.586 --> 02:13:49.721
YEAR -- THE REPRODUCTIVE RATES

02:13:49.788 --> 02:13:52.657
FAR EXCEED THE RATE OF HARVEST.

02:13:52.724 --> 02:13:54.593
THE PREVIOUS THERE HAS BEEN NO

02:13:54.659 --> 02:13:56.128
STUDY THAT SHOWS THAT THEY ARE

02:13:56.194 --> 02:13:57.662
THREATENED AT THIS TIME AND I

02:13:57.729 --> 02:13:58.964
THINK THAT WAS THE BIG POINT THE

02:13:59.030 --> 02:14:00.365
COMMISSIONER BROUGHT UP IS.

02:14:00.432 --> 02:14:02.734
ABSENT SOME CLEAR SCIENCE IT'S

02:14:02.801 --> 02:14:05.404
HARD TO DO A A BAND AND YOU

02:14:05.470 --> 02:14:06.805
BROUGHT REALLY SHOULDN'T PROCEED

02:14:06.872 --> 02:14:08.106
WITH THE MORATORIUM.

02:14:08.173 --> 02:14:09.708
UNTIL WE HAVE THAT SO WHY NOT DO

02:14:09.775 --> 02:14:11.209
THE STUDY.

02:14:11.276 --> 02:14:12.878
FIRST SO THAT WE KNOW REALLY

02:14:12.944 --> 02:14:14.746
WHAT'S GOING ON AND THEN WE

02:14:14.813 --> 02:14:17.048
COULD PROCEED TO A BAD WHAT

02:14:17.115 --> 02:14:17.883
RATHER THAN DOING THE BAND AND

02:14:17.949 --> 02:14:18.183
THE STUDY.

02:14:18.250 --> 02:14:19.317
WELL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I

02:14:19.384 --> 02:14:20.819
APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN ABOUT

02:14:20.886 --> 02:14:22.487
THE SCIENCE AND I THINK WE'RE

02:14:22.554 --> 02:14:24.189
ALL HERE IN AGREEMENT THAT THE

02:14:24.256 --> 02:14:25.590
SCIENCES AND ON EITHER SIDE.

02:14:25.657 --> 02:14:27.659
AND UNTIL IT IS WE SHOULD STOP

02:14:27.726 --> 02:14:29.594
THE HUNTING BE ABLE TO GET THE

02:14:29.661 --> 02:14:31.997
DATA I THINK IT'S VERY HARD FOR

02:14:32.063 --> 02:14:33.965
THE PRO HUNTING IS YES. TO MAKE

02:14:34.032 --> 02:14:35.300
THEIR ARGUMENTS AGAINST A

02:14:35.367 --> 02:14:37.068
LEGISLATION THAT WOULD MANDATE

02:14:37.135 --> 02:14:40.272
THE GATHERING TO EXTRACT THE

02:14:40.338 --> 02:14:44.276
SCIENTIFIC DATA.

02:14:44.342 --> 02:14:47.579
OKAY YES MISTER.

02:14:47.646 --> 02:14:50.415
SO CAN I CAN HELP YOU CAN I DO

02:14:50.482 --> 02:14:51.049
NEED EVERITT YET ALL RESPOND TO

02:14:51.116 --> 02:14:51.883
THAT AS WELL -- I JUST ONE AGAIN

02:14:51.950 --> 02:14:53.118
IT'S IT'S ALSO BASED ON HUMAN

02:14:53.185 --> 02:14:54.019
VALUES AND WE'VE DONE IT WE'VE

02:14:54.085 --> 02:14:54.686
DONE A SURVEY IN CALIFORNIA AND

02:14:54.753 --> 02:14:56.755
ABOUT 70% OF CALIFORNIANS ARE

02:14:56.822 --> 02:14:58.123
OPPOSED TO TROPHY HUNTING.

02:14:58.190 --> 02:14:59.991
AND WE DEFINE TROPHY HUNTING AS

02:15:00.058 --> 02:15:01.560
WHERE A PERSON'S PRIMARY

02:15:01.626 --> 02:15:04.095
MOTIVATION IS TO KILL AN ANIMAL

02:15:04.162 --> 02:15:06.431
IN ORDER TO DISPLAY BODY PARTS

02:15:06.498 --> 02:15:08.333
OR TO STUFF THE ANIMAL THEY TAKE

02:15:08.400 --> 02:15:10.235
A SELFIE WITH THE ANIMAL IT'S

02:15:10.302 --> 02:15:11.837
NOT NO ONE EATS BOBCAT.

02:15:11.903 --> 02:15:14.940
OR THEIR OR THEY'RE SELLING THE

02:15:15.006 --> 02:15:16.074
FIRS ABROAD.

02:15:16.141 --> 02:15:16.575
SO.

02:15:16.641 --> 02:15:17.709
ESSENTIALLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE AN

02:15:17.776 --> 02:15:19.010
END OF TROPHY HUNTING A BOBCATS.

02:15:19.077 --> 02:15:20.512
AND THERE ARE EXEMPTIONS IN THE

02:15:20.579 --> 02:15:22.581
BILL THAT STILL ALLOW FOR THE

02:15:22.647 --> 02:15:24.249
KILLING OF BOBCATS I THINK THERE

02:15:24.316 --> 02:15:25.984
ARE NUMBER OF EXEMPTIONS THAT

02:15:26.051 --> 02:15:27.552
ARE LISTED SO IT'S NOT.

02:15:27.619 --> 02:15:28.186
AND I WANT TO SAY IT'S NOT AN

02:15:28.253 --> 02:15:29.554
OUTRIGHT MORATORIUM BUT THERE

02:15:29.621 --> 02:15:31.890
ARE INSTANCES WHERE THE KILLING

02:15:31.957 --> 02:15:33.024
OF BOBCATS.

02:15:33.091 --> 02:15:35.026
WOULD BE ALLOWABLE -- IF THERE'S

02:15:35.093 --> 02:15:38.063
BODILY HARM IF THEY'RE ATTACKING --

02:15:38.129 --> 02:15:40.065
LIVESTOCK OR PETS IF YOU'RE

02:15:40.131 --> 02:15:41.867
INVOLVED IN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH

02:15:41.933 --> 02:15:43.802
IF YOU HAVE A PERMIT SO IT'S

02:15:43.869 --> 02:15:46.338
IT'S NOT AN OUTRIGHT MORATORIUM

02:15:46.404 --> 02:15:47.906
AND IN FACT -- AS WAS MENTIONED

02:15:47.973 --> 02:15:49.307
WE HAVE TAKEN COMMITTEE

02:15:49.374 --> 02:15:52.744
AMENDMENTS AND OUR HAPPY TO

02:15:52.811 --> 02:15:53.979
CONTINUE TO TALK TO THE

02:15:54.045 --> 02:15:55.814
COMMISSION -- THEY YOU KNOW

02:15:55.881 --> 02:15:57.516
AFTER MOMENTS COME INTO PRINT SO

02:15:57.582 --> 02:16:00.218
THAT WE CAN MOVE THIS YOU KNOW

02:16:00.285 --> 02:16:00.719
FURTHER ALONG.

02:16:00.785 --> 02:16:02.254
BUT IT DOES MAKE SENSE TO KIND

02:16:02.320 --> 02:16:04.656
OF STUDY THE ACTIONS TO TAKE A

02:16:04.723 --> 02:16:07.993
PAUSE AND STUDY BOTH THE AFFECTS

02:16:08.059 --> 02:16:10.395
OF THE BIO DIVERSITY -- IN OUR

02:16:10.462 --> 02:16:11.930
ECOSYSTEM YOU KNOW WITH THE

02:16:11.997 --> 02:16:13.965
BOBCATS WITH THEM REDUCING AND

02:16:14.032 --> 02:16:16.668
NUMBER -- AND ALLOW THE DATA TO

02:16:16.735 --> 02:16:18.203
SHARE WITH THIS.

02:16:18.270 --> 02:16:20.739
TO HELP THE STATE UNDERSTAND --

02:16:20.805 --> 02:16:22.173
AND DECIDE HOW IT WANTS TO

02:16:22.240 --> 02:16:24.075
CONTINUE TO ACT AS IT RELATES TO

02:16:24.142 --> 02:16:25.210
THE BOBCAT.

02:16:25.277 --> 02:16:27.312
SOUL.

02:16:27.379 --> 02:16:29.681
YES GO AHEAD AS WE MAKE A QUICK

02:16:29.748 --> 02:16:31.516
CORRECTION -- HUNTERS CANNOT

02:16:31.583 --> 02:16:32.384
SELL THE BOBCATS OUT OF STATE

02:16:32.450 --> 02:16:33.184
THERE'S A BAN ON COMMERCIAL TRAP

02:16:33.251 --> 02:16:34.819
YOU CAN'T SELL THESE BELTS THAT

02:16:34.886 --> 02:16:35.754
ALSO PEOPLE USE THEM.

02:16:35.820 --> 02:16:36.988
AND THEIR HOME AND AND WE WILL

02:16:37.055 --> 02:16:38.056
IN THE DISCUSSIONS WE HAD ABOUT

02:16:38.123 --> 02:16:40.292
IT DURING A VERY LONG MULTI YEAR

02:16:40.358 --> 02:16:41.493
PROCESS ON THE BAY COMMERCIAL

02:16:41.560 --> 02:16:42.260
BOBCAT TRAPPING.

02:16:42.327 --> 02:16:43.395
IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR THAT WHILE

02:16:43.461 --> 02:16:44.329
IT'S TRUE THAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T

02:16:44.396 --> 02:16:46.197
EAT BOBCAT THAT -- THE MOSTTHAT

02:16:46.264 --> 02:16:48.366
ARE USED FOR PELTS BY THE PEOPLE

02:16:48.433 --> 02:16:50.101
WHO WANT TO MINUTES AND IT'S A

02:16:50.168 --> 02:16:50.769
YOU KNOW IT'S WORLD FOLKS IN IN

02:16:50.835 --> 02:16:51.937
YOU KNOW IN VERY SMALL NUMBERS.

02:16:52.003 --> 02:16:53.672
WE DON'T KNOW THE EXACT NUMBERS

02:16:53.738 --> 02:16:55.140
NOW WE GOTTA GET IT THAT THAT'S

02:16:55.206 --> 02:16:56.408
CRITICAL ON THE LAST THAT EACH

02:16:56.474 --> 02:16:57.409
OTHER SOMETHING AROUND SEVENTY

02:16:57.475 --> 02:16:58.009
FIVE THOUSAND I BELIEVE CLOSE

02:16:58.076 --> 02:16:59.611
THAT SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND A

02:16:59.678 --> 02:17:00.145
LONG TIME AGO.

02:17:00.211 --> 02:17:01.146
BUT THERE'S NO INDICATION IT'S

02:17:01.212 --> 02:17:02.213
GOING DOWN AND WE WOULD

02:17:02.280 --> 02:17:03.748
CERTAINLY WELCOME A PETITION IF

02:17:03.815 --> 02:17:05.250
THEY'RE SCIENCE THAT SAYS.

02:17:05.317 --> 02:17:06.651
THAT WE NEED TO LIST THE SPECIES

02:17:06.718 --> 02:17:08.019
RIGHT AWAY WE WE TAKE THIS VERY

02:17:08.086 --> 02:17:09.554
SERIOUSLY AND THAT'S WERE MORE

02:17:09.621 --> 02:17:14.292
TORY COMMITTED PLACE BRENT SO

02:17:14.359 --> 02:17:15.226
ODD.

02:17:15.293 --> 02:17:16.595
TRYING TO GET TO THE CONCERN

02:17:16.661 --> 02:17:16.962
HERE WHICH IS.

02:17:17.028 --> 02:17:18.096
WHY NOT GO THROUGH A BUDGET

02:17:18.163 --> 02:17:19.397
PROCESS AND WORK WITH THE

02:17:19.464 --> 02:17:20.699
COMMISSION?

02:17:20.765 --> 02:17:22.534
WHY WASN'T THERE THOUGHT MAYBE

02:17:22.601 --> 02:17:25.637
TO THE SPONSORS? TO ACTUALLY ASK

02:17:25.704 --> 02:17:27.272
FOR A REQUEST FOR FUNDING.

02:17:27.339 --> 02:17:28.406
SO THAT THE COMMISSION COULD

02:17:28.473 --> 02:17:31.142
THEN DO THE LONG TERM STUDY OR

02:17:31.209 --> 02:17:32.911
SHORT TERM STUDY HOWEVER IT

02:17:32.978 --> 02:17:35.213
COMES ABOUT.

02:17:35.280 --> 02:17:37.415
SO THAT WE COULD IDENTIFY.

02:17:37.482 --> 02:17:39.818
IS THERE A NEED IS ARE WE ARE A

02:17:39.884 --> 02:17:41.019
PURPOSE OR PLACE FOR A

02:17:41.086 --> 02:17:43.188
MORATORIUM FOR THIS SPECIES

02:17:43.254 --> 02:17:44.089
COULD YOU ADDRESS THAT WELL

02:17:44.155 --> 02:17:45.690
AGAIN -- MOST PEOPLE IN

02:17:45.757 --> 02:17:47.659
CALIFORNIA DO NOT WANT TO HAVE A

02:17:47.726 --> 02:17:49.094
TROPHY HUNT ON BOBCATS AND WHAT

02:17:49.160 --> 02:17:51.329
THIS BILL WOULD DO WOULD GET

02:17:51.396 --> 02:17:53.131
FUNDING TO THE AGENCY SO THEY

02:17:53.198 --> 02:17:54.499
CAN STUDY THEM.

02:17:54.566 --> 02:17:56.368
AND YOU KNOW SOME OF THE BEST

02:17:56.434 --> 02:17:57.535
AVAILABLE SCIENCE RIGHT NOW IS

02:17:57.602 --> 02:17:59.237
IS YOU'VE GOT TO USE REMOTE

02:17:59.304 --> 02:18:01.039
CAMERA TECHNOLOGY -- ESPECIALLY

02:18:01.106 --> 02:18:02.374
WITH BOBCATS BECAUSE THEY HAVE A

02:18:02.440 --> 02:18:03.942
UNIQUE PATTERN IT'S IT'S EASY

02:18:04.009 --> 02:18:05.310
IT'S EASY TO USE THOSE KIND OF

02:18:05.377 --> 02:18:07.712
REMOTE CAMERAS SO.

02:18:07.779 --> 02:18:08.880
YOU KNOW.

02:18:08.947 --> 02:18:09.648
COUPLE MILLION DOLLARS THEY

02:18:09.714 --> 02:18:10.849
COULD PROBABLY YOU DO A PRETTY

02:18:10.915 --> 02:18:13.752
GOOD SIZE STUDY IN CALIFORNIA.

02:18:13.818 --> 02:18:16.121
ON BOBCT SO LET'S LET'S GET THE

02:18:16.187 --> 02:18:17.989
FUNDING LET'S DO IT LET'S LET'S

02:18:18.056 --> 02:18:19.891
PUT A MORATORIUM LET'S STUDY.

02:18:19.958 --> 02:18:20.859
BOBCATS LET'S SEE WHAT'S GOING

02:18:20.925 --> 02:18:22.360
ON AND WHEN YOU PUT THOSE

02:18:22.427 --> 02:18:23.762
CAMERAS OUT THERE NOT ONLY ARE

02:18:23.828 --> 02:18:24.629
YOU SEEING WHAT'S GOING ON WITH

02:18:24.696 --> 02:18:25.964
BOBCATS BUT YOU CAN STUDY OTHER

02:18:26.031 --> 02:18:28.767
ANIMALS TOO SO IT'S A IT'S A WIN

02:18:28.833 --> 02:18:30.201
WIN SITUATION.

02:18:30.268 --> 02:18:32.137
I I AGREE THAT THERE CAN BE A

02:18:32.203 --> 02:18:33.371
WIN WIN SITUATION.

02:18:33.438 --> 02:18:36.641
BUT I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT.

02:18:36.708 --> 02:18:37.976
AS WE LOOK AT BOB CATS THEY ARE

02:18:38.043 --> 02:18:40.478
PREDATORS AND INTO THEMSELVES

02:18:40.545 --> 02:18:42.213
AND AS A GROWING SPECIES THEY'RE

02:18:42.280 --> 02:18:43.648
HAVING AN IMPACT.

02:18:43.715 --> 02:18:45.083
ON THE WILD BIRDS.

02:18:45.150 --> 02:18:47.385
WE'RE SEEING A DECIMATION OF A

02:18:47.452 --> 02:18:50.321
QUAIL AND DUCK POPULATIONS ON

02:18:50.388 --> 02:18:50.855
THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE'RE

02:18:50.922 --> 02:18:53.058
SEEING OTHER SPECIES WHILE THE

02:18:53.124 --> 02:18:53.625
GRADS.

02:18:53.692 --> 02:18:55.560
GOING AWAY BECAUSE OF THE

02:18:55.627 --> 02:18:57.862
PREDATORS THAT ARE TAKING DOWN

02:18:57.929 --> 02:18:58.296
BECAUSE THERE'S AN

02:18:58.363 --> 02:18:59.898
OVERPOPULATION THERE'S A HUGE

02:18:59.964 --> 02:19:01.833
GROWTH IN THESE ARENAS FOR

02:19:01.900 --> 02:19:04.135
EXAMPLE YOU'RE USING INFORMATION.

02:19:04.202 --> 02:19:05.537
OF THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES WHICH

02:19:05.603 --> 02:19:08.106
YOU SAID SEVENTY SEVENTY FIVE

02:19:08.173 --> 02:19:08.940
THOUSAND IS WHAT THE BASS NUMBER

02:19:09.007 --> 02:19:10.675
WAS ON THAT.

02:19:10.742 --> 02:19:12.310
AT THAT TIME IN THE SEVENTIES IN

02:19:12.377 --> 02:19:13.645
FACT IF WE TAKE A LOOK AT THAT

02:19:13.712 --> 02:19:15.780
NUMBER JUST USING SEVENTY

02:19:15.847 --> 02:19:17.382
THOUSAND AND WE JUST ASSUME THAT

02:19:17.449 --> 02:19:20.018
HALF OF THEM WERE FEMALES AND OF

02:19:20.085 --> 02:19:20.652
BEARING.

02:19:20.719 --> 02:19:25.123
AGE -- THAT WOULD MEAN. THIRTY

02:19:25.190 --> 02:19:27.192
FIVE THOUSAND FEMALES COULD HAVE

02:19:27.258 --> 02:19:29.160
A POTENTIAL OF SIX LITTERS.

02:19:29.227 --> 02:19:30.762
IT'S A POTENTIAL THAT'S WHAT'S

02:19:30.829 --> 02:19:33.932
IN RESOURCE RESEARCHED DATA YOU

02:19:33.998 --> 02:19:36.634
CAN SAVE MORE OR I'M SAY LESS.

02:19:36.701 --> 02:19:38.903
BUT SIX IS THE NUMBER AND THEY

02:19:38.970 --> 02:19:40.939
HAVE AN AVERAGE OF EIGHT KITTENS

02:19:41.005 --> 02:19:43.541
SO IF WE LOOK AT TWO HUNDRED

02:19:43.608 --> 02:19:46.611
THOUSAND LETTERS OUT OF THAT.

02:19:46.678 --> 02:19:47.178
THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND AND WE

02:19:47.245 --> 02:19:49.914
MULTIPLY THE EIGHT TIMES.

02:19:49.981 --> 02:19:52.083
ON THOSE LETTERS THAT'S ONE

02:19:52.150 --> 02:19:53.485
POINT SIX MILLION.

02:19:53.551 --> 02:19:55.653
KEEP OUR BABY KITTENS THAT ARE

02:19:55.720 --> 02:19:57.522
GONNA GROW.

02:19:57.589 --> 02:19:59.224
MAN FROM NINETEEN YES MA'AM

02:19:59.290 --> 02:20:00.558
NINETEENTH THAT.

02:20:00.625 --> 02:20:02.861
YOU MAY WHEN I'M DONE OKAY A SO

02:20:02.927 --> 02:20:03.795
WHEN.

02:20:03.862 --> 02:20:06.264
OUR KITTENS GROW TO MATURITY

02:20:06.331 --> 02:20:07.932
THEY WILL BE ABLE WHICH IT TAKES

02:20:07.999 --> 02:20:08.500
A FULL YEAR BEFORE THEY CAN

02:20:08.566 --> 02:20:09.567
BREED.

02:20:09.634 --> 02:20:10.702
AND THAT NUMBER GOES ON AND

02:20:10.769 --> 02:20:12.337
EXTRAPOLATE BUT IF YOU TAKE A

02:20:12.403 --> 02:20:13.271
LOOK AT THAT ONE POINT SIX

02:20:13.338 --> 02:20:14.172
MILLION.

02:20:14.239 --> 02:20:15.206
I'M GONNA BE FOR TRY TO BE VERY

02:20:15.273 --> 02:20:17.542
I'D SAY 90% OF THEM DON'T MAKE

02:20:17.609 --> 02:20:20.011
IT.

02:20:20.078 --> 02:20:21.112
SO WHEN A MINUTE SORRY.

02:20:21.179 --> 02:20:22.046
THAT'S ONE MILLION FOUR HUNDRED

02:20:22.113 --> 02:20:25.216
THOUSAND IF WE LOOK AT THE A

02:20:25.283 --> 02:20:26.785
NUMBER OF ONE MILLION FOUR

02:20:26.851 --> 02:20:28.486
HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND AND

02:20:28.553 --> 02:20:31.089
REDUCE THAT FROM THE ONE SIX

02:20:31.156 --> 02:20:33.091
THAT'S A HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND

02:20:33.158 --> 02:20:33.925
NEW KITTENS.

02:20:33.992 --> 02:20:35.660
THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE BEARING

02:20:35.727 --> 02:20:37.295
THEIR CONTINUED TO GROW.

02:20:37.362 --> 02:20:40.331
WERE IN THAT IN THAT ALMOST TEN

02:20:40.398 --> 02:20:41.733
MILLION RANGE.

02:20:41.800 --> 02:20:44.335
AS THIS STARTS TO GROW AND EACH

02:20:44.402 --> 02:20:46.805
AND EVERY OTHER YEAR THOSE ARE

02:20:46.871 --> 02:20:49.507
SPRINGS ARE ABLE TO START.

02:20:49.574 --> 02:20:51.176
HAVING LITTLE BABY KITTENS THAT

02:20:51.242 --> 02:20:53.011
ARE GOING TO GROW INTO FEMALES

02:20:53.077 --> 02:20:54.379
THEY'RE GONNA BEAR MORE KITTENS.

02:20:54.445 --> 02:20:57.682
SO THERE'S A A HUGE NUMBER OF

02:20:57.749 --> 02:20:59.017
BOBCATS THAT EXIST.

02:20:59.083 --> 02:21:00.985
OUT IN THE WORLD SO REALLY THIS

02:21:01.052 --> 02:21:02.854
COMES DOWN TO A DEBATE OF

02:21:02.921 --> 02:21:06.491
PHILOSOPHICAL -- POSITIONS.

02:21:06.558 --> 02:21:07.926
PEOPLE THAT DON'T WANT THINGS

02:21:07.992 --> 02:21:10.094
TAKEN AND PEOPLE THAT ARE

02:21:10.161 --> 02:21:11.396
WANTING TO HAVE THE ABILITY. TO

02:21:11.462 --> 02:21:13.198
DO THAT.

02:21:13.264 --> 02:21:15.066
AND A THIRD COMPONENT.

02:21:15.133 --> 02:21:16.935
HUMAN INTERVENTION TO HELP KEEP

02:21:17.001 --> 02:21:18.703
THINGS IN CHECK.

02:21:18.770 --> 02:21:22.006
SO NOW HAVING SAID THAT.

02:21:22.073 --> 02:21:23.441
YOU HAVE THE FLOOR THANK YOU

02:21:23.508 --> 02:21:25.643
VERY MUCH SIR -- SO BOBCATS DO

02:21:25.710 --> 02:21:28.112
NOT REPRODUCE INFINITESIMALLY AS

02:21:28.179 --> 02:21:30.014
YOU'VE INDICATED A MOST BOBCAT

02:21:30.081 --> 02:21:31.416
KITTENS TO EVEN MAKE IT PAST THE

02:21:31.482 --> 02:21:33.017
FIRST YEAR AND THEY DON'T HAVE A

02:21:33.084 --> 02:21:34.519
KITTENS THEY HAVE ABOUT THREE ON

02:21:34.586 --> 02:21:35.353
AVERAGE.

02:21:35.420 --> 02:21:37.055
A FEMALE DOESN'T BECOME MATURE

02:21:37.121 --> 02:21:38.690
UNTIL SHE'S ABOUT TWO YEARS OLD

02:21:38.756 --> 02:21:40.325
AND THEN SHE'LL HAVE YOU KNOW

02:21:40.391 --> 02:21:42.894
ONE LETTER ABOUT EVERY YEAR MOST

02:21:42.961 --> 02:21:43.428
OF THOSE KITTENS WILL NOT

02:21:43.494 --> 02:21:44.229
SURVIVE.

02:21:44.295 --> 02:21:47.065
THE THE BOBCATS ALSO ARE PREYED

02:21:47.131 --> 02:21:50.235
UPON BY A DOMESTIC DOGS BY

02:21:50.301 --> 02:21:53.638
COYOTES BY MOUNTAIN LIONS -- AND

02:21:53.705 --> 02:21:54.973
THEY'RE IN COMPETITION WITH

02:21:55.039 --> 02:21:57.041
THOSE SAME CARNIVORES FOR

02:21:57.108 --> 02:21:58.776
RESOURCES SO.

02:21:58.843 --> 02:22:00.378
I MEAN BOBCATS ARE EXTREMELY

02:22:00.445 --> 02:22:03.781
RARE -- COMPARED TO THEIR PREY

02:22:03.848 --> 02:22:05.183
SPECIES SO -- YOU'RE NOT GONNA

02:22:05.250 --> 02:22:07.919
HAVE AN INFINITESIMAL NUMBER

02:22:07.986 --> 02:22:09.387
BOBCATS LOOK AT MOUNTAIN LION --

02:22:09.454 --> 02:22:10.555
OUTLINE HUNTING STOPPED IN

02:22:10.622 --> 02:22:13.024
CALIFORNIA IN THE EARLY NINETEEN

02:22:13.091 --> 02:22:14.025
SEVENTIES.

02:22:14.092 --> 02:22:16.027
AND YOU GUYS WE HAVE SOME OF THE

02:22:16.094 --> 02:22:17.862
BEST MOUNTAIN LION POPULATION

02:22:17.929 --> 02:22:19.163
AROUND A MOUNTAIN LINES REGULATE

02:22:19.230 --> 02:22:21.933
THEIR OWN -- BECAUSE THE THE

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.636
OLDER ADULT ANIMALS -- WILL KILL --

02:22:24.702 --> 02:22:27.205
INCOMING IMMIGRATING YOUNGER

02:22:27.272 --> 02:22:28.773
ANIMALS AND SO THEY THEY

02:22:28.840 --> 02:22:30.308
REGULATE THEIR OWN SO WE DON'T

02:22:30.375 --> 02:22:31.976
NEED HUMAN INTERVENTION TO

02:22:32.043 --> 02:22:34.445
REGULATE BOBCAT POPULATIONS AND

02:22:34.512 --> 02:22:36.581
AND CALIFORNIA'S EXPERIENCE.

02:22:36.648 --> 02:22:37.982
WITH OUTLINES IS SHOWN THAT'S

02:22:38.049 --> 02:22:39.150
THAT TO BE.

02:22:39.217 --> 02:22:40.385
ABSOLUTELY TRUE.

02:22:40.451 --> 02:22:42.053
WELL THANK YOU FOR THAT BUT I I

02:22:42.120 --> 02:22:44.355
WOULD SAY THAT WE BOTH HAVE DONE

02:22:44.422 --> 02:22:46.024
A RESEARCH ON ON THIS.

02:22:46.090 --> 02:22:47.625
AND THE CALIFORNIA FISH AND

02:22:47.692 --> 02:22:48.092
WILDLIFE.

02:22:48.159 --> 02:22:49.961
PRESENTS THAT INFORMATION AS TO

02:22:50.028 --> 02:22:53.231
THE REPRODUCTION AND THOSE

02:22:53.298 --> 02:22:55.333
NUMBERS.

02:22:55.400 --> 02:22:57.001
IN IN THEIR OWN -- ON OUR

02:22:57.068 --> 02:22:58.102
WEBSITE AND THERE ARE OTHER

02:22:58.169 --> 02:22:59.637
WEBSITES THAT PRODUCE THAT SAME

02:22:59.704 --> 02:23:00.605
INFORMATION THAT I CITED THAT'S

02:23:00.672 --> 02:23:02.006
WHY UTILIZED IT BECAUSE IT WOULD

02:23:02.073 --> 02:23:03.574
YOU CAN GO ON GO BILLION GO ON

02:23:03.641 --> 02:23:04.642
ANY SEARCH ENGINE.

02:23:04.709 --> 02:23:06.144
AND YOU CAN FIND THAT SAME

02:23:06.210 --> 02:23:08.846
INFORMATION AND I I GRANTED THE

02:23:08.913 --> 02:23:11.349
FACT OF MORTALITY WHEN I GAVE A

02:23:11.416 --> 02:23:14.519
90% MORTALITY RATE -- WITHIN THE

02:23:14.585 --> 02:23:15.653
RANGE.

02:23:15.720 --> 02:23:17.322
AND AS I GIVE THAT RANGE.

02:23:17.388 --> 02:23:18.756
THE NUMBERS ARE STILL.

02:23:18.823 --> 02:23:20.925
IN THE MILLIONS.

02:23:20.992 --> 02:23:22.160
AND IF YOU GET IF YOU HAVE A

02:23:22.226 --> 02:23:24.162
CHANCE TO GO OUT AND LOOK IN THE

02:23:24.228 --> 02:23:24.595
WILD.

02:23:24.662 --> 02:23:26.464
YOU GET TO SEE THE BOBCATS ON A

02:23:26.531 --> 02:23:28.299
REGULAR BASIS AT LEAST I'M ABLE

02:23:28.366 --> 02:23:30.101
TO GO OUT ON A REGULAR BASIS.

02:23:30.168 --> 02:23:31.970
AND SEE HIM AND ENJOY HIM.

ANTICOAGULANT RODENTICIDE.

02:41:24.074 --> 02:41:25.409

ACT WE ARE A STATEWIDE NONPROFIT

02:42:38.381 --> 02:42:40.016
DEDICATED TO EDUCATING PEOPLE

02:42:40.083 --> 02:42:41.451
ABOUT THE ECOLOGICAL ROLE OF

02:42:41.518 --> 02:42:42.819
BIRDS OF PREY.

02:42:42.886 --> 02:42:44.354
AND THE IMMINENT DANGER THEY AND

02:42:44.421 --> 02:42:46.123
OTHER WILDLIFE FACE FROM RAT

02:42:46.189 --> 02:42:47.424
POISON IN THE ECOSYSTEM.

02:42:47.491 --> 02:42:49.226
IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND AGAIN

02:42:49.292 --> 02:42:50.594
IN TWENTY ELEVEN COOPER'S HAWKS

02:42:50.660 --> 02:42:52.262
WERE FOUND BLEEDING TO DEATH ON

02:42:52.329 --> 02:42:54.231
THE STREET IN MY BAY AREA

02:42:54.297 --> 02:42:55.031
NEIGHBORHOOD.

02:42:55.098 --> 02:42:56.266
TESTS REVEALED THAT THE HAWKS

02:42:56.333 --> 02:42:58.301
HAD BEEN SECONDARILY POISONED

02:42:58.368 --> 02:42:59.936
AFTER CONSUMING POISON RESIDENTS.

02:43:00.003 --> 02:43:00.737
THE POISONS FOUND IN THEIR

02:43:00.804 --> 02:43:02.239
LIVERS WERE SECOND GENERATION

02:43:02.305 --> 02:43:04.374
ANTI COAGULANT SO STRONGLY ARE

02:43:04.441 --> 02:43:07.177
MARKETED AS ONE FEEDING KILLS.

02:43:07.244 --> 02:43:08.078
I QUICKLY DISCOVERED THAT

02:43:08.145 --> 02:43:08.912
SECONDARY POISONING WAS A

02:43:08.979 --> 02:43:10.547
STATEWIDE PROBLEM AFFECTING ALL

02:43:10.614 --> 02:43:11.848
OF THE BENEFICIAL WILDLIFE THAT

02:43:11.915 --> 02:43:13.250
HELP US CONTROL RODENTS

02:43:13.316 --> 02:43:15.118
NATURALLY OWLS HAWKS EAGLES

02:43:15.185 --> 02:43:16.887
BOXES MOUNTAIN LIONS BOBCATS AND

02:43:16.953 --> 02:43:18.255
MANY OTHERS.

02:43:18.321 --> 02:43:19.556
IN TWENTY FOURTEEN DUE TO THE

02:43:19.623 --> 02:43:21.124
DANGER THESE PRODUCTS POSE TO

02:43:21.191 --> 02:43:21.992
NON TARGET WILDLIFE THE

02:43:22.058 --> 02:43:22.993
DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE

02:43:23.059 --> 02:43:24.761
REGULATION REMOVED THEM FROM

CONSUMER SELVES.

02:43:25.962 --> 02:43:27.197
HOWEVER SCIENTIFIC DATA

02:43:27.264 --> 02:43:28.865
COLLECTED SINCE THAT TIME SHOW

02:43:28.932 --> 02:43:30.467
THE PROBLEM HAS NOT IMPROVED

02:43:30.534 --> 02:43:31.468
BECAUSE THE PEST CONTROL

02:43:31.535 --> 02:43:32.769
INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO USE THESE

02:43:32.836 --> 02:43:34.771
PRODUCTS WHICH KILL FAR MORE

02:43:34.838 --> 02:43:36.139
THAN RATS.

02:43:36.206 --> 02:43:37.073
STUDIES SHOW THAT POISON RODENTS

02:43:37.140 --> 02:43:38.808
ARE PREFERENTIALLY PREYED UPON

02:43:38.875 --> 02:43:40.410
BECAUSE THEY ARE SIX SLUGGISH

02:43:40.477 --> 02:43:41.645
AND EASIER TO CATCH.

02:43:41.711 --> 02:43:43.346
STUDIES IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN BY UC

02:43:43.413 --> 02:43:45.348
DAVIS UCLA AND THE CALIFORNIA

02:43:45.415 --> 02:43:47.317
ACADEMY OF SCIENCES FOUND THAT

02:43:47.384 --> 02:43:49.052
70% OF NORTHERN SPOTTED OWLS A

02:43:49.119 --> 02:43:50.487
THREATENED SPECIES TESTED

02:43:50.554 --> 02:43:51.955
POSITIVE FOR ROUTE POISON.

02:43:52.022 --> 02:43:53.690
MORE THAN 85% OF CALIFORNIA

02:43:53.757 --> 02:43:54.958
MOUNTAIN LIONS BOBCATS AT

02:43:55.025 --> 02:43:56.159
PACIFIC FISHERS HAVE BEEN

02:43:56.226 --> 02:43:57.327
EXPOSED TO THESE DANGEROUS

02:43:57.394 --> 02:43:58.562
POISONS.

02:43:58.628 --> 02:43:59.963
THE POISONS DID NOT IMMEDIATELY

02:44:00.030 --> 02:44:00.830
KILL THESE ANIMALS THEY CAN HAVE

02:44:00.897 --> 02:44:02.365
SUB LEGAL IMPACTS INCLUDING

02:44:02.432 --> 02:44:03.867
AFFECTING THE GENES THAT

02:44:03.934 --> 02:44:05.735
REGULATE THE IMMUNE SYSTEM.

02:44:05.802 --> 02:44:07.370
THIS MEANS ANIMALS LIKE BOBCATS

02:44:07.437 --> 02:44:08.838
MOUNTAIN ON LANDS A COYOTES ARE

02:44:08.905 --> 02:44:10.440
LESS ABLE TO FEND OFF DISEASES

02:44:10.507 --> 02:44:11.808
LIKE MANGE.

02:44:11.875 --> 02:44:13.710
STUDIES ON YOUNG BARN OWLS THAT

02:44:13.777 --> 02:44:14.744
HAVE CONSUMED POISON RODENTS

02:44:14.811 --> 02:44:17.013
FOUND LOWER BIRTH WEIGHTS AND

02:44:17.080 --> 02:44:18.815
SHORTER WINGS AND LEG BONES.

02:44:18.882 --> 02:44:19.916
OTHER NEW STUDIES JUST COMING

02:44:19.983 --> 02:44:21.318
OUT HAVE FOUND SECOND GENERATION

02:44:21.384 --> 02:44:25.689
ANTI COAGULANT IN FISH AND RIVER

DENNIS SIDE THIS IS CARPET

03:07:38.847 --> 03:07:39.047
BOMBING.

INDISCRIMINATELY.

03:07:43.018 --> 03:07:44.286
I SAW A VERY INTERESTING

03:07:44.353 --> 03:07:46.455
PRESENTATION BY CITY OF VENTURE

03:07:46.521 --> 03:07:48.924
I BELIEVE UP IN OXNARD WERE THEY

03:07:48.991 --> 03:07:50.258
THE CITY IT'S I THINK IT WAS THE

03:07:50.325 --> 03:07:51.460
CITY OR MAYBE IT WAS THE COUNTY

03:07:51.526 --> 03:07:52.494
HAD DONE.

03:07:52.561 --> 03:07:54.496
A STUDY WHERE THEY TOOK A

03:07:54.563 --> 03:07:56.098
SECTION OF DAM.

03:07:56.164 --> 03:07:58.066
OF NEAR AGRICULTURE AND THEY ONE

03:07:58.133 --> 03:07:59.234
HALF OF IT THEY USE TRADITIONAL

03:07:59.301 --> 03:08:00.802
RODENTICIDE WHICH WOULD NORMALLY

03:08:00.869 --> 03:08:02.337
BE USED ON THE OTHER SIDE THEY

03:08:02.404 --> 03:08:04.206
HAD A A SERIES WITH A ALL YOU

03:08:04.272 --> 03:08:05.540
HAVE TO DO IS PUT UP THE RAFTER

03:08:05.607 --> 03:08:10.178
HOUSES YOU DON'T HAVE DOUBLE THE

03:08:10.245 --> 03:08:12.614
AMOUNT OF RATS AND OTHER PESTS.

03:08:12.681 --> 03:08:15.083
IN THE ROAD GENOCIDE SECTION

03:08:15.150 --> 03:08:16.985
BECAUSE ALL OF THE PREDATORS

03:08:17.052 --> 03:08:18.453
ENDED UP GETTING KILLED OFF AND

03:08:18.520 --> 03:08:20.222
THE RIVER.

03:08:20.288 --> 03:08:23.625
RAFTER AND THE RATS WERE ABLE TO

03:08:23.692 --> 03:08:25.694
AVOID EATING THE POISON -- BUT

03:08:25.761 --> 03:08:27.162
NOT A LOT OF OTHER ANIMALS AND

03:08:27.229 --> 03:08:28.497
WE'RE IS THAT THE RAPTORS SIDE

03:08:28.563 --> 03:08:30.432
THEY SAW A HUGE DECREASE IN THE

03:08:30.499 --> 03:08:34.036
NUMBER OF RATS SO WE KNOW THAT

03:08:34.102 --> 03:08:38.640
THE USING -- OWLS IN RAPTOR

03:08:38.707 --> 03:08:39.941
WORKS REALLY WELL IN A LOT OF

03:08:40.008 --> 03:08:41.943
AREAS AND YOUR BILL DOES HAVE A

03:08:42.010 --> 03:08:44.746
VERY REASONABLE EXCLUSION.

03:08:44.813 --> 03:08:45.313
IF THERE'S A PUBLIC HEALTH

03:08:45.380 --> 03:08:46.114
CRISIS.

03:08:46.181 --> 03:08:47.382
ALSO I THINK IT STRIKES THE

03:08:47.449 --> 03:08:49.418
RIGHT BALANCE BUT I CAN TELL YOU

03:08:49.484 --> 03:08:50.585
THAT AS AN ELECTED

03:08:50.652 --> 03:08:51.620
REPRESENTATIVE.

03:08:51.687 --> 03:08:53.288
ON IN LOS ANGELES AND HAVING

03:08:53.355 --> 03:08:54.656
BEEN ON THE GLENDALE CITY

03:08:58.360 --> 03:09:00.228
WILDLIFE ALL THE TIME THIS IS

03:09:00.295 --> 03:09:01.930
SOMETHING THAT'S VERY CONCERNING

03:09:01.997 --> 03:09:02.764
TO CONSTITUENTS AND IT'S

03:09:02.831 --> 03:09:04.433
COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE.

03:09:04.499 --> 03:09:06.334
IN THE EYES OF MY VOTERS THAT WE

03:09:06.401 --> 03:09:07.502
HAVE THAT THERE IS THIS

03:09:07.569 --> 03:09:08.437
SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE

03:09:08.503 --> 03:09:10.005
THIS TRADE OFF WHEN THERE ARE

03:09:10.072 --> 03:09:11.506
OTHER ALTERNATIVES AVAILABLE.

03:09:11.573 --> 03:09:13.175
SO -- HI YOU KNOW THIS IS

03:09:13.241 --> 03:09:14.743
SOMETHING THAT I THINK ABOUT ALL

03:09:14.810 --> 03:09:17.679
THE TIME I AM SICK OF SEEING THE

03:09:17.746 --> 03:09:19.181
SICK ANIMALS.

03:09:19.247 --> 03:09:20.949
I'M SICK OF HEARING ABOUT

03:09:21.016 --> 03:09:23.552
MOUNTAIN LIONS IN GRIFFITH PARK --

03:09:23.618 --> 03:09:24.686

POISONING -- AND YOU KNOW.

03:09:28.390 --> 03:09:29.458
IF THIS IS SO SAY FOR THE

03:09:29.524 --> 03:09:32.928
PATENTED THE THE PEST CONTROL

03:09:32.994 --> 03:09:35.230
COMPANIES HAVE HAD YEARS TO

03:09:35.297 --> 03:09:38.100

STREAM THEY HAVEN'T DONE SO SO I

03:09:42.037 --> 03:09:43.538

03:09:43.605 --> 03:09:44.573
ACTION.

03:09:44.639 --> 03:09:46.875

TOOLS THAT THEY HAVE AND I DON'T

03:10:19.541 --> 03:10:20.709
TAKE ISSUE WITH THAT.

03:10:20.776 --> 03:10:22.677

MAYBE WHAT WE NEED IS A BETTER

03:38:10.544 --> 03:38:11.878
OVER OVERALL GOVERNANCE

03:38:11.945 --> 03:38:13.280

PERSISTENT THREAT TO FARMERS.

03:42:20.160 --> 03:42:21.528
ADDRESSES.

03:42:21.594 --> 03:42:22.796
THE FIRST IS THAT PARTICIPATION

03:42:22.862 --> 03:42:24.097
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN

03:42:24.164 --> 03:42:26.032
EXTREMELY LOW IN PART DUE TO

03:42:26.099 --> 03:42:27.467

SUGGESTED A FEW WAYS TO ADDRESS

03:42:36.743 --> 03:42:37.911
THAT.

03:42:37.977 --> 03:42:39.612
AND THIS BILL AS PROPOSED WOULD

03:42:39.679 --> 03:42:41.381
SET UP AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE OF

03:42:47.287 --> 03:42:48.855
STATE.

03:42:48.922 --> 03:42:50.090
THE SECOND IS THAT YOUR QUESTION

03:42:50.156 --> 03:42:51.791
OPERATORS NEED TARGETED

03:42:51.858 --> 03:42:53.626
CULTURALLY COMPETENT TRAINING TO

CAPTION COMPANIES CURRENTLY ARE

03:42:57.864 --> 03:43:00.633

WITH FAMILY FARMERS.

03:43:44.344 --> 03:43:45.578
WE'VE BEEN A BIG SUPPORTER OF

03:43:45.645 --> 03:43:47.514
SWEEP SINCE ITS INCEPTION BACK

03:43:47.580 --> 03:43:49.282
DURING THE DROUGHT.

03:43:49.349 --> 03:43:51.084
IT'S THE ONLY STATE PROGRAM THAT

03:43:51.151 --> 03:43:53.686
FOCUSES ON IMPROVING ON FARM

03:43:53.753 --> 03:43:55.588
WATER USE EFFICIENCY.

03:43:55.655 --> 03:43:57.190
IT TENDS TO BE FORGOTTEN DURING --

03:43:57.257 --> 03:43:59.025
BUDGET DISCUSSIONS PARTICULARLY

03:43:59.092 --> 03:44:01.427
WHEN IT RAINS -- BUT AGRICULTURE

03:44:01.494 --> 03:44:02.962
IN CALIFORNIA FROM OUR POINT OF

03:44:03.029 --> 03:44:04.430
VIEW PHASES AN EXISTENTIAL

03:44:04.497 --> 03:44:05.698
CRISIS.

03:44:05.765 --> 03:44:07.634
AROUND WATER AS THE CLAIMANT

03:44:07.700 --> 03:44:08.701
HEATS UP.

03:44:08.768 --> 03:44:10.570
AS WE TRY TO STOP OVER DRAFTING

03:44:10.637 --> 03:44:12.372
GROUND WATER AND AND THE GREATER

03:44:12.438 --> 03:44:14.274
ENVIRONMENTAL DEMANDS ARE MADE

03:44:14.340 --> 03:44:15.508
ON SURFACE WATER.

03:44:15.575 --> 03:44:17.811
WE NEED TO BE AS EFFICIENT AS WE

03:44:17.877 --> 03:44:19.312
CAN BE DURING THE SUMMER.

03:44:19.379 --> 03:44:20.613
AND SOMEHOW FIND A WAY TO

03:44:20.680 --> 03:44:23.216
RECHARGE AQUIFERS IN THE WINTER

03:44:23.283 --> 03:44:23.616
TIME.

03:44:23.683 --> 03:44:25.418
WE SUPPORT AB TEN EIGHTY SIX

03:44:25.485 --> 03:44:26.786
BECAUSE IT'LL FOCUS SWEEP ON

03:44:26.853 --> 03:44:28.521
SUPPORT FOR SMALLER FARMS THAT

03:44:28.588 --> 03:44:29.823
OTHERWISE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO

03:44:29.889 --> 03:44:31.357
INVEST IN MODERN IRRIGATION

03:44:31.424 --> 03:44:32.826
SYSTEMS AND WE THINK THAT THIS

03:44:32.892 --> 03:44:34.227
IS AN APPROPRIATE USE OF STATE

03:44:34.294 --> 03:44:36.396
FUNDS.

03:44:36.462 --> 03:44:37.997

03:44:45.305 --> 03:44:47.006
AND GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY.

03:44:47.073 --> 03:44:48.308
TO ACTUALLY FUND TRAININGS FOR

03:44:48.374 --> 03:44:50.510
GRANT RECIPIENTS AND PERHAPS TO

TO WORK WITH FARMERS TO IMPROVE

03:44:54.714 --> 03:44:56.115
PRACTICES ON THEIR FARMS.

03:44:56.182 --> 03:44:58.017
PEOPLE WANT MICRO YOUR GAUGE IN

03:44:58.084 --> 03:44:59.485
BECAUSE IT INCREASES THE YIELDS

03:44:59.552 --> 03:45:01.821
AND ECONOMIC RETURNS BUT IT ALSO

03:45:01.888 --> 03:45:03.523

AGRICULTURE BUT WE BELIEVE THAT

03:45:14.868 --> 03:45:17.070
SWEET COULD BE A VERY IMPORTANT

03:45:17.136 --> 03:45:18.872
PART OF SOLVING WATER PROBLEMS

03:46:31.644 --> 03:46:32.512
FOREMOST LIKE TO THINK THE

03:46:32.578 --> 03:46:33.813
AUTHOR AND HER STAFF AND THE

03:46:33.880 --> 03:46:35.014
COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS AS

03:46:35.081 --> 03:46:37.183
SPECIFICALLY ABOUT NEGOTIATING

03:46:37.250 --> 03:46:37.817
ON SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT

03:46:37.884 --> 03:46:38.651
WE HAD.

03:46:38.718 --> 03:46:39.519
OUR UPS ON THE ISSUES THAT WE

03:46:39.585 --> 03:46:41.454
HAD -- WITH WE THINK THAT SWEEP

03:46:41.521 --> 03:46:42.889
IS A PIVOTAL PROGRAM MINUTES

03:46:42.956 --> 03:46:44.023
HISTORICALLY ALLOWED FARMERS AND

03:46:44.090 --> 03:46:45.525
RANCHERS TO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE

03:46:45.591 --> 03:46:46.859
SOME OF THE WATER AND ENERGY

03:46:46.926 --> 03:46:48.728
SAVINGS IN A MEANINGFUL MANNER

03:46:48.795 --> 03:46:50.697
ON FARM -- AND WHILE THE

03:46:50.763 --> 03:46:51.965
PROPOSED LANGUAGE THAT IS ARE

03:46:52.031 --> 03:46:52.899
THE COMMITTEE MINUTES ARE AN

03:46:52.966 --> 03:46:54.434
IMPROVEMENT ON AT THE BASE LINE

03:46:54.500 --> 03:46:55.435
I THINK THERE ARE FEW

03:46:55.501 --> 03:46:56.569
OUTSTANDING PIECES THAT DO

03:46:56.636 --> 03:46:58.071
REQUIRE SOME CONSIDERATION THAT

03:46:58.137 --> 03:46:59.038
ARE.

03:46:59.105 --> 03:47:00.473
A DEVIATION FROM HOW SWEET AS

03:47:00.540 --> 03:47:02.942
MANAGE NOW -- SPECIFICALLY ONE

03:47:03.009 --> 03:47:04.277
IS THE INCLUSION OF WATER

03:47:04.344 --> 03:47:06.579
QUALITY AS A NEW OBJECTIVE --

03:47:06.646 --> 03:47:07.714
THAT CERTAINLY YOU CAN MAKE AN

03:47:07.780 --> 03:47:09.282
ARGUMENT THAT FOR EDUCATION HAS

03:47:09.349 --> 03:47:10.616
WATER HAS A WATER QUALITY

03:47:10.683 --> 03:47:12.585
BENEFITS BUT IT'S NOT MEASURED

03:47:12.652 --> 03:47:13.987
UNDER THE EXISTING PROGRAM AND

03:47:14.053 --> 03:47:14.988
THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT HOW

03:47:15.054 --> 03:47:16.322
SWEET WOULD HAVE TO TRANSITION

03:47:16.389 --> 03:47:18.791
TO MEASURE THAT -- ADDITIONALLY

03:47:18.858 --> 03:47:20.994
THE BILL WOULD PROHIBIT -- A

03:47:21.060 --> 03:47:22.528
GROWER FROM APPLYING TO FOR THE

03:47:22.595 --> 03:47:23.997
DOLLARS OR IMPLEMENTING THE

03:47:24.063 --> 03:47:25.131
SYSTEM IF THEY CHOOSE TO

03:47:25.198 --> 03:47:29.369
TRANSITION TO A SIGNIFICANTLY

03:47:29.435 --> 03:47:30.803
HIGHER WATER USE CROP -- WE NOW

03:47:30.870 --> 03:47:31.437
WITH THE ADVENT OF SIGMA WE'RE

03:47:31.504 --> 03:47:32.338
GONNA SEE WATER BUDGETS ALL OVER

03:47:32.405 --> 03:47:34.474
THE PLACE ON AGRICULTURAL

03:47:34.540 --> 03:47:35.908
OPERATIONS -- AND THERE ARE

03:47:35.975 --> 03:47:37.477
FARMERS NEED NOW MORE SO THAN

03:47:37.543 --> 03:47:39.712
EVER FLEXIBILITY TO ADAPT TO

03:47:39.779 --> 03:47:41.147
THOSE CHANGES YOU MAY ACTUALLY

03:47:41.214 --> 03:47:42.482
SEE THAT INCREASE WHICH WOULD

03:47:42.548 --> 03:47:44.484
OBLIGATE YOU OR ALLOW YOU UNDER

03:47:44.550 --> 03:47:45.918
ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES A

03:47:45.985 --> 03:47:47.120
TRANSITION TO A HIGHWAY HIGHER

03:47:47.186 --> 03:47:48.454
WATER USE CROP AND IF WE DO THAT

03:47:48.521 --> 03:47:49.155
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE.

03:47:49.222 --> 03:47:50.323
THEY'RE USING THE MOST EFFICIENT

03:47:50.390 --> 03:47:52.225
TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE THAT WILL

03:47:52.291 --> 03:47:53.960
HAVE THOSE GHG EMISSION

03:47:54.027 --> 03:47:55.995
REDUCTIONS ENERGY SAVINGS -- SO

03:47:56.062 --> 03:47:57.163

BELIEVE SWEEP ONE POINT OUT --

03:48:05.872 --> 03:48:07.507
AND THE EXCESS SORT OF SPEAKS

03:48:07.573 --> 03:48:09.042
FOR ITSELF SO -- IF WE ARE GOING

SIXTY AND YOU HAVE A BE.

04:01:11.657 --> 04:01:12.224
FOURTEEN FIFTEEN WHICH WOULD YOU

04:01:12.291 --> 04:01:12.858
LIKE FIRST.

04:01:12.925 --> 04:01:14.726
LET'S TAKE NUMBER SIX LET'S TAKE

04:01:14.793 --> 04:01:18.530
A BE -- SIXTY OKAY THE BILL.

04:01:18.597 --> 04:01:19.998
WE HAVE A MOTION.

04:01:20.065 --> 04:01:22.901
WE HAVE A SECOND BUT MR SOLACE.

04:01:22.968 --> 04:01:24.002
HOW DOES BE VERY BRIEF YOU MAY

04:01:24.069 --> 04:01:25.404
MANY OF YOU SAW THIS BILL LAST

04:01:25.470 --> 04:01:26.872
YEAR WHEN IT WAS JUST AS GOOD A

04:01:26.939 --> 04:01:27.539
BILL?

04:01:27.606 --> 04:01:28.974
THIS YEAR IT'S EVEN BETTER AND

04:01:29.041 --> 04:01:32.044
IT'S ABOUT HAVING A FISSION SEE

04:01:32.110 --> 04:01:33.879
STANDARDS FOR WATER METERS.

04:01:33.946 --> 04:01:34.546
WITH THAT I WOULD ASK FOR AN AYE

04:01:34.613 --> 04:01:35.714
VOTE AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

04:01:35.781 --> 04:01:37.583
QUESTIONS AND I DO HAVE -- WITH

04:01:37.649 --> 04:01:39.017
ME TODAY TREE SEQUENCE FROM AND

04:01:39.084 --> 04:01:40.986
OUR DC TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT TO

04:01:41.053 --> 04:01:43.255
TELL YOU WHY THIS IS SO

04:01:43.322 --> 04:01:43.889
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF

04:01:43.956 --> 04:01:44.957
YOU.

04:01:45.023 --> 04:01:45.858
A GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS TRACY

04:01:45.924 --> 04:01:47.292
QUINN I'M WITH THE NATURAL

04:01:47.359 --> 04:01:49.027
RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL I WILL

04:01:49.094 --> 04:01:49.995
TRY TO KEEP IT FREE FALL

04:01:50.062 --> 04:01:51.096
COVERING JUST A FEW TALKING

04:01:51.163 --> 04:01:51.964
POINTS.

04:01:52.030 --> 04:01:53.699
OF THE NEED FOR AB SIXTY ARISES

04:01:53.765 --> 04:01:54.600
FROM THE TENDENCY OF WATER

04:01:54.666 --> 04:01:56.235
METERS TO PERFORM POORLY WITH

04:01:56.301 --> 04:01:57.436
THE FLOW THROUGH THE WATER WHEN

04:01:57.502 --> 04:01:58.337
THAT FLOW THROUGH THE WATER

04:01:58.403 --> 04:01:59.705
METER IS VERY LOW.

04:01:59.771 --> 04:02:01.073
THE RESULT IS THAT EVEN WITH

04:02:01.139 --> 04:02:02.908
BRAND AB RAINY METERS LOW FLOWS

04:02:02.975 --> 04:02:04.176
THAT ARE INDICATIVE OF LEAKAGE

04:02:04.243 --> 04:02:06.245
ARE EITHER UNDER RECORDED OR NOT

04:02:06.311 --> 04:02:07.613
RECORDED AT ALL.

04:02:07.679 --> 04:02:09.715
THE CENTRAL CHALLENGE THAT AB

04:02:09.781 --> 04:02:10.582
SIXTY SIX TO ADDRESS IS THAT THE

04:02:10.649 --> 04:02:12.384
CALL CURRENT VOLUNTARY STANDARDS

04:02:12.451 --> 04:02:13.719
FOR THE ACCURACY OF WATER METERS

04:02:13.785 --> 04:02:16.021
DO NOT EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS THE

04:02:16.088 --> 04:02:17.789
NEED FOR ACCURACY AT LOW FLOWS.

04:02:17.856 --> 04:02:18.891
THE LACKS.

04:02:18.957 --> 04:02:21.827
INDUSTRY SPECIFICATIONS HAVE

04:02:21.894 --> 04:02:22.461
REMAINED UNCHANGED FOR DECADES.

04:02:22.527 --> 04:02:23.428
FOR THE MOST COMMON SIZE OF

04:02:23.495 --> 04:02:25.163
RESIDENTIAL METERS THE VOLUNTARY

04:02:25.230 --> 04:02:26.832
INDUSTRY STANDARDS CALL FOR A

04:02:26.899 --> 04:02:28.734
LOW FLOW ACCURATE TEST ACCURACY

04:02:28.800 --> 04:02:30.469
TEST OF ONE QUARTER GALLON PER

04:02:30.535 --> 04:02:31.904
MINUTE. TO PUT THAT IN

04:02:31.970 --> 04:02:34.606
PERSPECTIVE A LEAK OF ABOUT

04:02:34.673 --> 04:02:35.941
THREE HUNDRED GALLONS PER DAY

04:02:36.008 --> 04:02:37.709
COULD BE NOT RECORDED AT ALL.

04:02:37.776 --> 04:02:39.077
FOR THE LARGER METERS NOW

04:02:39.144 --> 04:02:40.846
REQUIRED BY SOME UTILITIES THE

04:02:40.913 --> 04:02:42.714
LOCAL ACTION ACCURACY TEST IS

04:02:42.781 --> 04:02:43.882
PERFORMED AT THREE QUARTER

04:02:43.949 --> 04:02:47.953
GALLONS PER MINUTE A HALF

04:02:48.020 --> 04:02:49.254
GALLONS PER MINUTE AT ONE AND A

04:02:49.321 --> 04:02:49.454
HALF.

04:02:49.521 --> 04:02:51.223
INCH METERS.

04:02:51.290 --> 04:02:52.424
MOST SHOWERS THERE A LOT OF

04:02:52.491 --> 04:02:53.558
PEOPLE TAKE SHOWERS AT ONE HALF

04:02:53.625 --> 04:02:54.626
GALLONS PER MINUTE SO YOU CAN

04:02:54.693 --> 04:02:56.328
SEE THAT THIS COULD BE A REALLY

04:02:56.395 --> 04:02:58.263
BIG PROBLEM -- THE METERS WOULD

04:02:58.330 --> 04:02:59.965
FAIL TO CABBAGE TO CAPTURE

04:03:00.032 --> 04:03:01.300
ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF LEAKAGE AS

04:03:01.366 --> 04:03:03.535
WELL AS OTHER INTENDED USES LIKE

04:03:03.602 --> 04:03:04.836
DRIP IRRIGATION.

04:03:04.903 --> 04:03:06.271
WHEN A METER FAILS RECORD WATER

04:03:06.338 --> 04:03:08.040
DELIVER TO SOME CUSTOMERS TO

04:03:08.106 --> 04:03:09.641
ADVERSE EFFECTS TAKE PLACE?

04:03:09.708 --> 04:03:11.176
THE UTILITY DOES NOT RECEIVE AS

04:03:11.243 --> 04:03:12.678
MUCH REVENUE AS IT SHOULD SO

04:03:12.744 --> 04:03:14.212
IT'S REYES MUST BE INCREASE FOR

04:03:14.279 --> 04:03:15.180
ALL CUSTOMERS TO MAKE UP THE

04:03:15.247 --> 04:03:16.281
DIFFERENCE.

04:03:16.348 --> 04:03:17.316
AND THE CUSTOMER GETS NO

04:03:17.382 --> 04:03:19.484
INDICATION FROM THEIR WATER BILL

04:03:19.551 --> 04:03:20.886
THAT THEY MAY HAVE A HIDDEN LAKE.

04:03:20.953 --> 04:03:21.486
AND THEY HAVE NO INCENTIVE TO

04:03:21.553 --> 04:03:22.621
LOOK.

04:03:22.688 --> 04:03:23.922
SIMPLY PUT METERS THAT ARE MORE

04:03:23.989 --> 04:03:25.891
ACCURATE CAN HELP CUSTOMERS SAVE

04:03:25.958 --> 04:03:27.859
MONEY AND SAY WATER AND

04:03:27.926 --> 04:03:28.493
UTILITIES CLICK THE REVENUE THEY

04:03:28.560 --> 04:03:29.895
NEED.

04:03:29.962 --> 04:03:30.662
WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE NEW

04:03:30.729 --> 04:03:32.264
METERS AVAILABLE TODAY THAT ARE

04:03:32.331 --> 04:03:33.598
MORE ACCURATE THAN WAS REQUIRED

04:03:33.665 --> 04:03:35.434
BY THE VOLUNTARY TERRY STANDARDS

04:03:35.500 --> 04:03:37.369
BECAUSE WE TESTED THEM.

04:03:37.436 --> 04:03:38.804
A TOTAL OF EIGHTY FOUR METERS

04:03:38.870 --> 04:03:40.105
WERE TESTED DRAWN FROM SIX

04:03:40.172 --> 04:03:42.240
PROMINENT US MANUFACTURERS.

04:03:42.307 --> 04:03:43.809
WE TESTED MULTIPLE SAMPLES OF

04:03:43.875 --> 04:03:45.577
THE SAME TYPE OF METER AND EACH

04:03:45.644 --> 04:03:47.045
METER WAS TESTED TWICE.

04:03:47.112 --> 04:03:49.147
THE RESULTS CONFIRMED AND WERE

04:03:49.214 --> 04:03:51.283
SIMILAR TO A PREVIOUS TEST BY

04:03:51.350 --> 04:03:52.684
OUR CITY BY UTAH STATE.

04:03:52.751 --> 04:03:54.152
WHICH FOUND THAT.

04:03:54.219 --> 04:03:55.120
THERE IS SOME VARIABILITY IN THE

04:03:55.187 --> 04:03:57.823
ACCURACY OF METERS AT LOW FLOWS

04:03:57.889 --> 04:03:59.358
EVEN WITHIN THE SAME METER TYPES.

04:03:59.424 --> 04:04:00.792
METERS WITH ACCEPTABLE ACCURACY

04:04:00.859 --> 04:04:02.194
FLOWS LOWER THAN THE INDUSTRY

04:04:02.260 --> 04:04:03.628
VOLUNTARY STANDARDS ARE

04:04:03.695 --> 04:04:05.464
CURRENTLY AVAILABLE.

04:04:05.530 --> 04:04:07.699
GREATER LOW FLOW AGASSI NEED NOT

04:04:07.766 --> 04:04:09.234
APPLY GREATER COST.

04:04:09.301 --> 04:04:10.936
AS NEARLY ALL OF THE METERS A WE

04:04:11.003 --> 04:04:12.537
TESTED WERE MECHANICAL METERS

04:04:12.604 --> 04:04:14.373
DRAWN FROM OUR PARTNER UTILITIES

04:04:14.439 --> 04:04:16.341
INVENTORIES OF NEW READERS AND

04:04:16.408 --> 04:04:17.876
THEY WERE NOT PREMIUM PRICED NEW

04:04:17.943 --> 04:04:19.444
TECHNOLOGY.

04:04:19.511 --> 04:04:21.046
A STATE STANDARD COULD CUT THE

04:04:21.113 --> 04:04:22.748
LOW FLOW TEST RATE IN THE THE

04:04:22.814 --> 04:04:24.483
ONES IN THE VOLUNTARY INDUSTRY

04:04:24.549 --> 04:04:25.751
STANDARD AND HALF AND PERHAPS

04:04:25.817 --> 04:04:27.686
EVEN LOWER WITHOUT A MAJOR

04:04:27.753 --> 04:04:29.721
REDUCTION AND UTILITY CHOICE OF

04:04:29.788 --> 04:04:30.889
METER SUPPLY.

04:04:30.956 --> 04:04:34.159
AB SIXTY ALLOWS THE CC UNTIL

04:04:34.226 --> 04:04:34.760
TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO SET WATER

04:04:34.826 --> 04:04:36.428
METER STANDARDS IT ALSO ALLOWS

04:04:36.495 --> 04:04:38.430
UTILITIES TO CONTINUE TO RECEIVE

WANT TO START OFF BY THANKING

04:05:44.863 --> 04:05:47.399
THE AUTHOR STAFF FOR THE

04:05:47.466 --> 04:05:49.434
SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS THE

04:05:49.501 --> 04:05:50.469
BILL OVER LAST YEAR.

04:05:50.535 --> 04:05:52.904
A LOT OF THE CONCERNS THAT THE

04:05:52.971 --> 04:05:54.539
DOES THAT WATER RATES IN OTHER

04:05:54.606 --> 04:05:56.675
OF MY CLIENTS HAD HAVE BEEN

04:05:56.741 --> 04:05:58.176
ADDRESSED BY THE AUTHOR.

04:05:58.243 --> 04:05:59.711
I THINK WE'RE REALLY LEFT WITH

04:05:59.778 --> 04:06:02.714
THE QUESTION AS TO WHAT THE NEED

04:06:02.781 --> 04:06:05.584
IS HERE -- THE AGENCY BELIEVES

04:06:05.650 --> 04:06:06.718
THAT THE AMERICAN WATER WORKS

04:06:06.785 --> 04:06:08.687
ASSOCIATION AND THE STANDARDS

04:06:08.753 --> 04:06:10.088
THAT THAT INTERNATIONALLY

04:06:10.155 --> 04:06:11.990
RECOGNIZED SCIENTIFIC IN

04:06:12.057 --> 04:06:15.594
INDUSTRY -- GROUP PUT TOGETHER

04:06:15.660 --> 04:06:18.130
ARE SUFFICIENT THE NEW LAWS NOT

04:06:18.196 --> 04:06:18.864
NECESSARY.

04:06:18.930 --> 04:06:20.198
BUT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE

04:06:20.265 --> 04:06:22.000
POTENTIAL COSTS THE BILL DOES

04:06:22.067 --> 04:06:23.502
REQUIRE.

04:06:23.568 --> 04:06:25.270
THE COMMISSION TO LOOK AT THE

04:06:25.337 --> 04:06:26.771
LIFE CYCLE COSTS.

04:06:26.838 --> 04:06:28.974
UNDERSTAND THAT THESE LOW FLOW

04:06:29.040 --> 04:06:31.343
HI IF IT HI READ METERS WHILE

04:06:31.409 --> 04:06:32.811
THEY MAY CUT.

04:06:32.878 --> 04:06:34.846
THE ACCURACY AND HOW FOR TALKING

04:06:34.913 --> 04:06:37.782
ABOUT MOVING FROM A 95297%

04:06:37.849 --> 04:06:41.887
ACCURACY 298% ACCURACY SO WE'RE

04:06:41.953 --> 04:06:43.922
WE'RE GOING TO ACHIEVE A 1%.

04:06:43.989 --> 04:06:45.891
THE SIGNAL THAT THE CONSUMER

04:06:45.957 --> 04:06:47.392
WILL RECEIVE FROM THAT MORE

04:06:47.459 --> 04:06:49.828
ACCURATE METER WILL NOT BE WILL

04:06:49.895 --> 04:06:51.229
BE NEGLIGIBLE.

04:06:51.296 --> 04:06:53.431
BECAUSE WE BILL THEN ONE HUNDRED

04:06:53.498 --> 04:06:54.966
CUBIC FEET.

04:06:55.033 --> 04:06:58.336
INCREMENTS AND FOR USERS FOR

04:06:58.403 --> 04:07:00.105
TYPICAL SINGLE FAMILY HOME THAT

04:07:00.172 --> 04:07:01.806
DON'T USE A LOT OF WATER IT'S

04:07:01.873 --> 04:07:03.175
GOING TO TAKE THE NEARLY ONE

04:07:03.241 --> 04:07:04.943
YEAR AND A CITY DIFFERENT SO.

04:07:05.010 --> 04:07:06.511
BE CAREFUL WITH THE POTENTIAL

04:07:06.578 --> 04:07:08.213
COSTS THAT WERE INVOLVED IN THIS

04:07:08.280 --> 04:07:10.448
BILL WE THINK THE A. W. DAY.

04:07:10.515 --> 04:07:11.917
W. W. A. DOES A GOOD JOB IT

04:07:11.983 --> 04:07:14.819
SHOULD CONTINUE BE RELIED ON

04:07:14.886 --> 04:07:16.688
WITH US FOR A NO VOTE.

04:07:16.755 --> 04:07:19.124
THE OTHER OPPOSITION.

04:07:19.191 --> 04:07:21.393
HAD SEEN THAT WILL BRING IT BACK

04:07:21.459 --> 04:07:22.027
TO COMMITTEE I GUESS WE DO HAVE

04:07:22.093 --> 04:07:26.798
A MOTION BY IS MISTER WOULD --

04:07:26.865 --> 04:07:28.800
SORRY BY THE MS GARCIA AND

04:07:28.867 --> 04:07:31.002
SECONDED BY MISTER SOUTH.

04:07:31.069 --> 04:07:32.971
YES MISTER DOLLAR SO -- JUST A

04:07:33.038 --> 04:07:34.773
QUESTION I KNOW THIS IS THE

04:07:34.839 --> 04:07:36.508
POLICY COMMITTEE NOT THE

04:07:36.575 --> 04:07:37.409
FINANCIAL COMMITTEE WHICH IS

04:07:37.475 --> 04:07:38.910
SOMETHING I HAVE CONCERT WITH

04:07:38.977 --> 04:07:40.278
THAT CAN YOU TELL ME.

04:07:40.345 --> 04:07:42.347
SO GIVE ME AN IDEA SO I HAVE

04:07:42.414 --> 04:07:43.114
REPRESENT.

04:07:43.181 --> 04:07:44.349
VERY SMALL COMMUNITIES WITH

04:07:44.416 --> 04:07:46.184
WATER SYSTEMS AND SO WHAT WOULD

04:07:46.251 --> 04:07:48.053
YOU WHAT DO YOU PERCEIVE IT TO

04:07:48.119 --> 04:07:48.653
BE.

04:07:48.720 --> 04:07:50.288
WHERE WHERE'S THE POINT GOING TO

04:07:50.355 --> 04:07:52.357
BE MEASURED OUT I GUESS IS SO

04:07:52.424 --> 04:07:53.758
YOU'RE MAJORING AT THE?

04:07:53.825 --> 04:07:55.827
DISCHARGE WERE YOU DISCHARGED

04:07:55.894 --> 04:07:57.929
INTO THE SYSTEM OR AT THE WHAT'S

04:07:57.996 --> 04:07:59.130
THE PROCESS FOR ALL THESE

04:07:59.197 --> 04:08:00.498
DIFFERENT THERE'S SO MANY

04:08:00.565 --> 04:08:01.967
DIFFERENT TYPES OF ANOTHER'S

04:08:02.033 --> 04:08:03.468
SYSTEMS OUT THERE SO YEAH THIS

04:08:03.535 --> 04:08:04.970
IS FOR THE INDIVIDUAL HOME

04:08:05.036 --> 04:08:06.671
BEATER AND JUST TO CLARIFY --

04:08:06.738 --> 04:08:08.273
THE GENTLEMAN WHO JUST SPOKE WAS

04:08:08.340 --> 04:08:09.341
REALLY COMPARING APPLES AND

04:08:09.407 --> 04:08:10.442
ORANGES HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE

04:08:10.508 --> 04:08:11.977
ACCURACY PERCENTAGE WERE TALKING

04:08:12.043 --> 04:08:13.278
ABOUT THE FLOW THAT THEY CAN

04:08:13.345 --> 04:08:14.446
MEASURE.

04:08:14.512 --> 04:08:16.114
SO THE METERS THAT THAT ARE

04:08:16.181 --> 04:08:18.149
OFTEN USE NOW DON'T RECORD THOSE

04:08:18.216 --> 04:08:19.818
LOWER FLOWS SO IT'S NOT A

04:08:19.884 --> 04:08:21.553
QUESTION OF A 1% DIFFERENCE IT'S

04:08:21.620 --> 04:08:22.554
RECORDING.

04:08:22.621 --> 04:08:25.257
A MUCH HIGHER -- IT'S IT'S

04:08:25.323 --> 04:08:26.858
RECORDING THE WATER -- THAT

04:08:26.925 --> 04:08:28.293
RIGHT NOW IS NOT BEING REALLY

04:08:28.360 --> 04:08:30.428
CAPTURED -- AND I JUST WANNA

04:08:30.495 --> 04:08:31.863
ALSO POINT OUT THAT LAST YEAR

04:08:31.930 --> 04:08:33.665
THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO -- FOUND

04:08:33.732 --> 04:08:35.033
OUT THAT THEY HAD HAD A TWO

04:08:35.100 --> 04:08:36.968
MILLION DOLLAR OVER CHARGE FOR

04:08:37.035 --> 04:08:37.535
CUSTOMERS FROM AN ACCURATE

04:08:37.602 --> 04:08:38.470
METERS.

04:08:38.536 --> 04:08:39.904
AND WE'VE SEEN ACROSS THE STATE

04:08:39.971 --> 04:08:41.506
OTHER MUNICIPALITIES RUN INTO

04:08:41.573 --> 04:08:43.341
PROBLEMS WITH METERS SO THIS IS

04:08:43.408 --> 04:08:44.109
SOMETHING THAT'S OF CONCERN TO

04:08:44.175 --> 04:08:45.143
ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS WE WANT

04:08:45.210 --> 04:08:46.278
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE

04:08:46.344 --> 04:08:50.382
BEST OF TECHNOLOGY THAT'S OUT

04:08:50.448 --> 04:08:52.350
THERE. TO DO YOU ENVISION WHAT

04:08:52.417 --> 04:08:53.551
THIS BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO YOU'RE

04:08:53.618 --> 04:08:54.886
TALKING ABOUT IT IS A PHASE IN

04:08:54.953 --> 04:08:57.088
PROCESS SO SO THIS IS THE COST

04:08:57.155 --> 04:08:58.823
AND SO WE'RE BEEN WE'VE IN THE

04:08:58.890 --> 04:09:01.259
COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS THAT I

04:09:01.326 --> 04:09:02.761
REPRESENT.

04:09:02.827 --> 04:09:05.163
ARE BEING NICK THEY'RE BEING

04:09:05.230 --> 04:09:06.965
CHARGED WITH A LOT OF TASK AND

04:09:07.032 --> 04:09:08.533
THERE'S NO ABILITY TO RECOUP THE

04:09:08.600 --> 04:09:09.467
COST.

04:09:09.534 --> 04:09:11.136
YEP PROPOSITION TWO EIGHTEEN

04:09:11.202 --> 04:09:12.671
WHICH ALLOWS A TWO THIRDS VOTE

04:09:12.737 --> 04:09:17.509
BY THE PEOPLE ARE BEING TAXED OR

04:09:17.575 --> 04:09:19.010
FEET OR WHATEVER WHAT DO YOU.

04:09:19.077 --> 04:09:20.011
WHERE FRAUDULENT PUT IT SO I'M

04:09:20.078 --> 04:09:21.146
GOING TO YEAH I'M TRYING?

04:09:21.212 --> 04:09:22.714
TO GET MY MIND AROUND WHAT THE

04:09:22.781 --> 04:09:24.382
HOW THIS IS GONNA BE IMPLEMENTED

04:09:24.449 --> 04:09:26.084
AND THE TECHNOLOGY.

04:09:26.151 --> 04:09:27.452
THE TECHNOLOGY DIFFERENCES IN

04:09:27.519 --> 04:09:29.187
WHAT WE HAVE NOW VERSUS WHAT

04:09:29.254 --> 04:09:31.122
YOU'RE GOING TO REGULATE YEAH SO

04:09:31.189 --> 04:09:34.359
WE'RE NOT -- ASKING FOLKS TO TO

04:09:34.426 --> 04:09:35.760
INVEST IN A NEW TECHNOLOGY --

04:09:35.827 --> 04:09:37.595
WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT YOU KNOW

04:09:37.662 --> 04:09:38.663
THERE'S A VARIETY OF METERS THAT

04:09:38.730 --> 04:09:39.931
ARE OUT ON THE MARKET RIGHT NOW

04:09:39.998 --> 04:09:41.166
AND SOME PERFORM BETTER THAN

04:09:41.232 --> 04:09:42.634
OTHERS EVEN WITHIN EACH CLASS

04:09:42.701 --> 04:09:43.468
TYPE SO?

04:09:43.535 --> 04:09:44.736
MECHANICAL METERS ARE THE ONES

04:09:44.803 --> 04:09:45.804
THAT ARE MORE AFFORDABLE THEY'RE

04:09:45.870 --> 04:09:46.938
THE ONES THAT ARE MOST COMMON

04:09:47.005 --> 04:09:48.440
AND EVEN WITHIN THOSE TWO

04:09:48.506 --> 04:09:49.407
DIFFERENT TYPES OF MECHANICAL

04:09:49.474 --> 04:09:50.909
METERS SOME PERFORM BETTER.

04:09:50.975 --> 04:09:52.944
AND SO WE'RE JUST ASKING IS THAT

04:09:53.011 --> 04:09:54.813
CC SET STANDARDS SO WE CAN MAKE

04:09:54.879 --> 04:09:56.448
SURE THAT OUR WATER UTILITIES

04:09:56.514 --> 04:09:57.382
ARE.

04:09:57.449 --> 04:09:58.550
PURCHASING METERS THAT CAN

04:09:58.616 --> 04:10:00.952
MEASURE AT THOSE BUT THOSE X..

04:10:01.019 --> 04:10:02.354
EXTENDED LOS LOBOS THERE SHOULD

04:10:02.420 --> 04:10:03.521
BE A COST DIFFERENCE TO THE

04:10:03.588 --> 04:10:04.556
WATER DISTRICT BECAUSE THERE'S

04:10:04.622 --> 04:10:07.992
PLENTY METERS OTHER THAT ME WHAT

04:10:08.059 --> 04:10:10.362
WE'RE ASKING.

04:10:10.428 --> 04:10:10.962
FOR THEY WON'T HAVE TO REPLACE

04:10:11.029 --> 04:10:11.629
WHAT THEY HAVE WE'RE NOT ASKING

04:10:11.696 --> 04:10:12.497
THEM TO GO IN WE EVEN SAYING

04:10:12.564 --> 04:10:13.031
THAT THOUGH IF I WILL.

04:10:13.098 --> 04:10:14.799
WATER UTILITY HAS A CONTRACT A

04:10:14.866 --> 04:10:15.967
MULTI YEAR CONTRACT TO BUY A

04:10:16.034 --> 04:10:17.602
CERTAIN METER THAT THEY CAN

04:10:17.669 --> 04:10:19.471
CONTINUE TO PURCHASE THAT --

04:10:19.537 --> 04:10:20.872
THROUGH A DATE CERTAIN AND SO

04:10:20.939 --> 04:10:23.074
THERE THERE SHOULD BE A HUGE

04:10:23.141 --> 04:10:24.075
COST IMPACT TO A WATER SUPPLY

04:10:24.142 --> 04:10:24.376
[inaudible]

STAKEHOLDERS TO TRY MOVE AWAY

04:17:29.133 --> 04:17:30.835
FROM CIVIL PENALTIES TO OTHER

04:17:30.902 --> 04:17:34.038
MEANS OF ACHIEVING COMPLIANCE.

04:17:34.105 --> 04:17:35.373
WITH RESPECT TO ADD WATER

04:17:35.439 --> 04:17:37.842
MANAGEMENT PLANS WE NEGOTIATED A

04:17:37.909 --> 04:17:40.578
COMPROMISE WHERE IF AN AD WATER

04:17:40.645 --> 04:17:43.047
SUPPLIER DID NOT DO THE PLAN.

04:17:43.114 --> 04:17:44.048
THEN THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER

04:17:44.115 --> 04:17:46.317
RESOURCES COULD WRITE THE PLAN

04:17:46.384 --> 04:17:47.919
AND CHARGE THAT.

04:17:47.985 --> 04:17:49.821
WATER SUPPLIER FOR DOING THAT

04:17:49.887 --> 04:17:51.589
PLAN IF THE WATER SUPPLIER

04:17:51.656 --> 04:17:53.825
FAILED TO COOPERATE WITH THAT

04:17:53.891 --> 04:17:54.725
EFFORT.

04:17:54.792 --> 04:17:56.294
THEN THEY COULD BE SUBJECT TO

04:17:56.360 --> 04:17:58.329
CIVIL PENALTIES WE THINK IT WAS

04:17:58.396 --> 04:17:59.797
AN ELEGANCE AN APPROPRIATE

04:17:59.864 --> 04:18:02.200
COMPROMISE ONE THAT WAS INCLUDED

04:18:02.266 --> 04:18:03.467
IN THIS AUTHORS BILL THAT WAS

04:18:03.534 --> 04:18:06.470
SIGNED INTO LAW A. B..

04:18:06.537 --> 04:18:07.071
SIXTEEN SIXTY EIGHT NOW COMES

04:18:07.138 --> 04:18:09.173
THIS BILL TO IMPOSE A CIVIL

04:18:09.240 --> 04:18:12.310
PENALTY OUTSIDE OF THAT PROCESS.

04:18:12.376 --> 04:18:14.111
THE FINAL POINT WITH RESPECT TO

04:18:14.178 --> 04:18:15.079
SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER

04:18:15.146 --> 04:18:17.014
MANAGEMENT PLANS GROUNDWATER

04:18:17.081 --> 04:18:18.516
SUSTAINABILITY PLANS.

04:18:18.583 --> 04:18:21.185
THE PENALTY THAT WE NEGOTIATE IN

04:18:21.252 --> 04:18:21.819
TWENTY FIFTEEN WITH RESPECT TO

SIGMA AND TRUST ME EVERY WORD IN

THAT BILL THAT LAW WAS.

04:18:26.524 --> 04:18:28.025
VERY.

04:18:28.092 --> 04:18:29.694
HOTLY DEBATED AND DISCUSSED.

04:18:29.760 --> 04:18:32.063
THE PENALTY FOR NOT DOING A PLAN

04:18:32.129 --> 04:18:33.231
IS THE STATE WATER RESOURCES

04:18:33.297 --> 04:18:35.666
CONTROL BOARD TAKES OVER YOUR

04:18:35.733 --> 04:18:37.602
YOUR BASIN.

04:18:37.668 --> 04:18:39.537
SO WE DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARY

04:18:39.604 --> 04:18:42.139
TO HAVE A CIVIL PENALTY OF FIVE

04:18:42.206 --> 04:18:43.341
HUNDRED DOLLARS OR A THOUSAND

04:18:43.407 --> 04:18:44.976
DOLLARS WE THINK.

04:18:45.042 --> 04:18:45.977
FOLKS ARE CONCERNED WITH THE

04:18:46.043 --> 04:18:47.745

CONTROLLING GROUNDWATER

04:18:49.213 --> 04:18:50.915
EXTRACTIONS IN THESE AREAS.

04:18:50.982 --> 04:18:52.516
THOSE PLANS AREN'T EVEN DO AND

04:18:52.583 --> 04:18:54.886
TELL TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY

04:18:54.952 --> 04:18:55.953
TWENTY TWO AND AND YET HERE WE

04:18:56.020 --> 04:18:57.989
ARE AT THE BILL TO US ESTABLISH

04:18:58.055 --> 04:19:00.091
A CIVIL PENALTY. ONE WE GIVE

04:19:00.157 --> 04:19:01.359
FOLKS.

04:19:01.425 --> 04:19:02.927
WATER DISTRICT A CHANCE TO

04:19:02.994 --> 04:19:04.595
COMPLY WITH THESE MULTIPLE STATE

04:19:04.662 --> 04:19:06.063
MANDATES THAT HAVE LARGELY BEEN

04:19:06.130 --> 04:19:09.867
ADOPTED SINCE THE TWENTY TEN AND

04:19:09.934 --> 04:19:10.935
THEN SEE HOW WE'RE DOING AT THAT

04:19:11.002 --> 04:19:13.371
POINT SO WITH RESPECT QUESTION

04:19:13.437 --> 04:19:15.940
OF A THE OTHER WITNESSES IN

04:19:16.007 --> 04:19:18.643
OPPOSITION.

04:19:18.709 --> 04:19:19.677
SEE NOW WILL BRING IT BACK TO

04:19:19.744 --> 04:19:22.313
THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS.

04:19:22.380 --> 04:19:25.283

IF FOR THE AUTHOR MAYBE IT'S

04:19:28.519 --> 04:19:31.455
JUST ONE OF THE NERDY THINGS

04:19:31.522 --> 04:19:33.391
INSIDE THE BILL -- WHAT'S THE

04:19:33.457 --> 04:19:34.959

THE SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY AND

04:19:43.801 --> 04:19:46.604
THE PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE.

04:19:46.671 --> 04:19:47.939
WHY IS WHY IS THAT ELEMENT IN

04:19:48.005 --> 04:19:49.707
THERE I SUPPOSE THAT WE COULD

04:19:49.774 --> 04:19:51.075
DISTRIBUTE THE NON COMPLIANCE

04:19:51.142 --> 04:19:53.177

THAT IS WELL REAL REASONS THAT'S

04:19:55.579 --> 04:19:56.447
REALLY THE PART OF THE QUESTION

04:19:56.514 --> 04:19:58.482
I WAS WANTING I WAS A REASON FOR

04:19:58.549 --> 04:19:59.283
THAT.

04:19:59.350 --> 04:20:00.818
AND IF THERE WASN'T A REASON MY

04:20:00.885 --> 04:20:02.286
NEXT.

04:20:02.353 --> 04:20:04.155
ASK COULD BE CAN WE JUST DO THAT

04:20:04.221 --> 04:20:05.756

04:20:12.563 --> 04:20:14.098
FOR A PRESS WE COULD I'M BIGGEST

04:20:14.165 --> 04:20:15.066
TRADITIONALLY IN THROUGH THE

04:20:15.132 --> 04:20:16.267
JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET

04:20:16.334 --> 04:20:17.601
COMMITTEES.

04:20:17.668 --> 04:20:20.071

USED WE WERE JUST PICKING

04:20:24.775 --> 04:20:25.810
STANDING SO I JUST THOUGHT IT

04:20:25.876 --> 04:20:27.178
WAS ONE OF THOSE NASTY THINGS

04:20:27.244 --> 04:20:29.547

04:20:29.613 --> 04:20:30.848
NO PROBLEM WITH THAT.

04:20:30.915 --> 04:20:31.682
I STILL DRUG STRUGGLE WITH MUCH

04:20:31.749 --> 04:20:33.551
OF THE BILL BUT I I THERE WAS

04:20:33.617 --> 04:20:34.452
JUST ONE OF THOSE NERDY THINGS

04:20:34.518 --> 04:20:34.885
YOU KNOW.

04:20:34.952 --> 04:20:36.287
LOOKING THROUGH THERE SO I

04:20:36.354 --> 04:20:38.022
APPRECIATE YOUR HELP.

04:20:38.089 --> 04:20:41.125
IN EXPLAINING IT.

04:20:41.192 --> 04:20:43.627
THE OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS --

04:20:43.694 --> 04:20:47.164
MAYBE JUST IN IN YOUR CLOTHES.

04:20:47.231 --> 04:20:48.866
YOU KNOW MAYBE ADDRESSING SOME

04:20:48.933 --> 04:20:50.067
OF THE THINGS THAT MR RE BROUGHT

04:20:50.134 --> 04:20:54.605
UP -- WITH REGARD TO HEY WE HAD.

04:20:54.672 --> 04:20:55.172
SIXTEEN SIXTY EIGHT I THINK

04:20:55.239 --> 04:20:56.207
ESPECIALLY WITH AG DISTRICTS

04:20:56.273 --> 04:20:56.974
WERE CUT ALREADY HAVE THIS

04:20:57.041 --> 04:20:59.343
PROCESS IN PLACE AND NOW IT

04:20:59.410 --> 04:21:01.212
SEEMS LIKE HERE COMES ANOTHER.

04:21:01.278 --> 04:21:03.748
YEAH POTENTIAL PENALTY.

04:21:03.814 --> 04:21:05.916
IS THIS MAY BE TOO TOO SOON.

04:21:05.983 --> 04:21:08.052
MAYBE SEE HOW SIXTEEN SIXTY

04:21:08.119 --> 04:21:08.786
EIGHT IS IMPLEMENTED.

04:21:08.853 --> 04:21:11.255
WELL THIS IS NOT ONLY FOR

04:21:11.322 --> 04:21:11.822
SIXTEEN SIXTY EIGHT IT'S FOR

04:21:11.889 --> 04:21:13.357
OTHER -- REPORTING AS WELL AND

04:21:13.424 --> 04:21:14.625
WE DO KNOW THAT THEIR AGENCIES

04:21:14.692 --> 04:21:15.960
THAT FOR YEARS HAVE BEEN OUT OF

04:21:16.027 --> 04:21:17.128
COMPLIANCE.

04:21:17.194 --> 04:21:18.095
AND YOU KNOW YOU HEARD IT RIGHT

04:21:18.162 --> 04:21:19.730
THERE THAT A LOT OF THE AGENCIES

04:21:19.797 --> 04:21:20.865
CONSIDER.

04:21:20.931 --> 04:21:22.466
WHAT WE DO TO BE WITH AT OUR

04:21:22.533 --> 04:21:25.036
WHIM YOU KNOW ONEROUS ALL OF

04:21:25.102 --> 04:21:26.570
THAT THIS CLEARLY AN ATTITUDE I

04:21:26.637 --> 04:21:28.072
THINK WITH SOME AGENCIES THAT

04:21:28.139 --> 04:21:29.040
THEY JUST DON'T HAVE -- TO

04:21:29.106 --> 04:21:30.141
COMPLY I MEAN THEY'RE NOT

04:21:30.207 --> 04:21:32.043
COMPLYING SO IF AGENCIES ARE

04:21:32.109 --> 04:21:33.411
WILLFULLY NOT COMPLYING THERE

04:21:33.477 --> 04:21:34.512
HAS TO BE SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN

04:21:34.578 --> 04:21:36.514
DO TO GET THEM INTO COMPLIANCE

04:21:36.580 --> 04:21:37.948
THIS IS WE'RE TALKING SUCH A

04:21:38.015 --> 04:21:39.316
SMALL YOU KNOW WHAT A NOMINAL

04:21:39.383 --> 04:21:40.718
AMOUNT BUT IT WOULD IT'S REALLY

04:21:40.785 --> 04:21:41.552
INTENDED TO GET THEIR ATTENTION.

04:21:41.619 --> 04:21:43.254
AND TO SAY IT'S NOT JUST OUR

04:21:43.320 --> 04:21:45.256
WHIMS WE DO THIS WITH INTENTION

04:21:45.322 --> 04:21:46.857
AND WE EXPECT THESE REPORTS TO

04:21:46.924 --> 04:21:48.159
BE GENERATED.

04:21:48.225 --> 04:21:49.460
AND I WILL SAY ALSO WE HAVE

04:21:49.527 --> 04:21:50.494
ANOTHER BILL THAT'S GOING TO BE

04:21:50.561 --> 04:21:51.629
SEEN BY THIS COMMITTEE IT MAY

04:21:51.695 --> 04:21:52.763
HAVE ALREADY GONE THROUGH ON

04:21:52.830 --> 04:21:53.831
CONTENT I'M NOT SURE THAT.

04:21:53.898 --> 04:21:55.099
THAT I DON'T REMEMBER THAT

04:21:55.166 --> 04:21:57.034
STREAMLINES THE REPORTING TO TRY

04:21:57.101 --> 04:21:57.902
TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE

04:21:57.968 --> 04:21:59.403
AGENCIES SO THAT IF THEY WANT TO

04:21:59.470 --> 04:22:00.438
THEY CAN JUST DO THE REPORTING

04:22:00.504 --> 04:22:02.339
ONCE A YEAR INSTEAD OF HAVING TO

04:22:02.406 --> 04:22:03.374
LOOK EVERY MONTH TO SEE WHAT'S

04:22:03.441 --> 04:22:03.841
DO.

04:22:03.908 --> 04:22:05.142
SO WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS

04:22:05.209 --> 04:22:06.644
RED TAPE FOR A LOT OF AGENCIES

04:22:06.710 --> 04:22:09.046
WE ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT

04:22:09.113 --> 04:22:10.347
AND REDUCE IT AND MAKE IT EASIER

04:22:10.414 --> 04:22:11.482
AT THE SAME TIME.

04:22:11.549 --> 04:22:12.783
BUT YOU HAVE TO IT WHEN YOU HAVE

04:22:12.850 --> 04:22:16.454
AGENCIES THAT HAVE BEEN COMPLIED.

04:22:16.520 --> 04:22:17.088
WHAT DO WE DO WHAT ELSE CAN WE

04:22:17.154 --> 04:22:19.824
POSSIBLY DO AT THIS POINT -- AND

04:22:19.890 --> 04:22:21.125
IT DOES SAY THAT YOU HAVE YOUR

04:22:21.192 --> 04:22:22.526
CAN WAVE OF PEOPLE ARE MAKING

04:22:22.593 --> 04:22:24.929
pTOWARDS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO

04:22:24.995 --> 04:22:27.331
DO THIS -- SO I THINK THAT IT'S

04:22:27.398 --> 04:22:29.767
VERY REASONABLE AND IF AND IF

04:22:29.834 --> 04:22:31.302
THE AGENCIES.

04:22:31.368 --> 04:22:32.803
DON'T WANT.

04:22:32.870 --> 04:22:34.738
TO HAVE THIS ADMINISTRATIVE

04:22:34.805 --> 04:22:35.306
PENALTY THEY CAN JUST COMPLY

04:22:35.372 --> 04:22:38.509
WITH THE LAW.

04:22:38.576 --> 04:22:41.145
OKAY -- WELL THAT IT DOES HAVE A

04:22:41.212 --> 04:22:42.913
DO PASS RECOMMENDATION FROM THE

04:22:42.980 --> 04:22:45.583
CHAIR.

04:22:45.649 --> 04:22:48.152
THE AYE. FOR ME PERSONALLY I

04:22:48.219 --> 04:22:49.553
THINK.

04:22:49.620 --> 04:22:50.888
THOUGH I UNDERSTAND THE INTENT

04:22:50.955 --> 04:22:51.922
OF WE WANT TO BRING PEOPLE INTO

04:22:51.989 --> 04:22:53.390
COMPLIANCE I THINK THERE'S A LOT

04:22:53.457 --> 04:22:54.558
OF THESE DISTRICTS.

04:22:54.625 --> 04:22:56.760
AS A SOLOMON DALLY BROUGHT UP --

04:22:56.827 --> 04:22:59.029
THEY'RE STRUGGLING WITH THEIR

04:22:59.096 --> 04:23:00.731
REVENUES AS IS.

04:23:00.798 --> 04:23:01.966
AND KEEPING UP WITH ALL THE

04:23:02.032 --> 04:23:04.001
EXISTING REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE

04:23:04.068 --> 04:23:06.003
OUT THERE -- AND THEN THE OTHER

04:23:06.070 --> 04:23:08.038
THING IS AS WE MOVE INTO

04:23:08.105 --> 04:23:09.607
CONSERVATION IS A WAY OF LIFE.

04:23:09.673 --> 04:23:11.108
AS YOU'RE.

04:23:11.175 --> 04:23:12.843
HAVING THOSE RATE PAYERS --

04:23:12.910 --> 04:23:14.578
CONSERVE.

04:23:14.645 --> 04:23:16.046
IT ALSO BECOMES ACTUALLY MORE

04:23:16.113 --> 04:23:19.016
EXPENSIVE FOR THAT REPAIR --

04:23:19.083 --> 04:23:20.317
BECAUSE THEY STILL HAVE YOU'VE

04:23:20.384 --> 04:23:21.252
NO MATTER HOW MUCH THEY CAN

04:23:21.318 --> 04:23:22.520
SERVE THEIR THE END UP ACTUALLY

04:23:22.586 --> 04:23:25.256
PAYING THE SAME SOMETIMES ANSWER.

04:23:25.322 --> 04:23:27.124
YOU KNOW APPLY TO THEM AS YOU

04:23:27.191 --> 04:23:28.759
KNOW IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH

04:23:28.826 --> 04:23:30.861
THESE PROVISIONS SO.

04:23:30.928 --> 04:23:31.695
YEAH -- AND THEN IF WE HAVE A

04:23:31.762 --> 04:23:33.297
FINE LEVIED UPON THE ALTERNATELY

ALTHOUGH THE STATE PARK RANGERS

04:28:12.943 --> 04:28:14.745
THAT ARE COMPLETELY SUPPORTS THE

04:28:14.812 --> 04:28:16.380
BAN ON SMOKING IN THE PARK WE

04:28:16.447 --> 04:28:18.115
HAVE TWO CONCERNS ABOUT SOME OF

04:28:18.182 --> 04:28:19.716
THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL.

04:28:19.783 --> 04:28:20.651
IN OUR POINT OF VIEW COMES

04:28:20.717 --> 04:28:22.152
DIRECTLY FROM.

04:28:22.219 --> 04:28:23.454
THE RANGER IN THE FIELD WAS

04:28:23.520 --> 04:28:25.055
GOING TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR

04:28:25.122 --> 04:28:27.357
SUCCESSFULLY.

04:28:27.424 --> 04:28:29.493
IMPLEMENTING THIS BAND -- OUR

04:28:29.560 --> 04:28:31.361
CONCERNS THIS THE MORE MINOR

04:28:31.428 --> 04:28:32.729
CONCERN IS THE BAIL AMOUNT

04:28:32.796 --> 04:28:34.631
CURRENTLY BILL MONTHS TWENTY

04:28:34.698 --> 04:28:35.132
FIVE WHICH IS.

04:28:35.199 --> 04:28:37.768
VERY LOW AND INCONSISTENT WITH --

04:28:37.835 --> 04:28:38.702
THE MAIL AMOUNT FOR THE

04:28:38.769 --> 04:28:40.204

04:28:40.270 --> 04:28:41.305
BANDS.

04:28:41.371 --> 04:28:43.407
THE STATE WIDE ONE IS UP TO

04:28:43.474 --> 04:28:44.541
HUNDRED AND UP TO FIVE HUNDRED

04:28:44.608 --> 04:28:46.410
MULTIPLE ARE CALIFORNIA STATE

04:28:46.477 --> 04:28:48.111
PARK REGULATIONS AS INFRACTIONS

04:28:48.178 --> 04:28:52.583

04:28:52.649 --> 04:28:54.051
OF UP TO A THOUSAND AND OF

04:28:54.117 --> 04:28:54.651
COURSE THAT'S NOT THE AMOUNT

04:28:54.718 --> 04:28:56.019
THAT THE DA'S IN THE COURTS

04:28:56.086 --> 04:28:59.056
DECIDE THE ACTUAL BAIL AMOUNTS --

04:28:59.122 --> 04:28:59.556
DEPENDING ON THEIR LOCAL

04:28:59.623 --> 04:29:02.559
CONDITIONS -- OUR SECOND MORE

04:29:02.626 --> 04:29:04.828
SERIOUS -- CONSIDERATION HAS TO

04:29:04.895 --> 04:29:07.297
DO WITH THE AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN

04:29:07.364 --> 04:29:08.765
THE RELIGIOUS BELIEF LANGUAGE

04:29:08.832 --> 04:29:09.933
THE COULD EASILY MAKE

04:29:10.000 --> 04:29:11.468
ENFORCEMENT IN THE FIELD BY OUR

04:29:11.535 --> 04:29:13.403
RANGERS IN THE FIELD.

04:29:13.470 --> 04:29:15.305
LARGELY IMPOSSIBLE.

04:29:15.372 --> 04:29:17.841
THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT --

04:29:17.908 --> 04:29:20.244
FIELD RANGERS HAVE NO WAY TO

04:29:20.310 --> 04:29:22.179
VERIFY A PERSON'S PERSONAL

04:29:22.246 --> 04:29:25.215
BELIEF AND IT'S VERY HARD FOR

04:29:25.282 --> 04:29:26.850
THEM TO BE ABLE TO ASCERTAIN.

04:29:26.917 --> 04:29:29.386
A PERSON CAN SIMPLY SAY.

04:29:29.453 --> 04:29:31.688
I HADN'T I'M SMOKING IS MY

04:29:31.755 --> 04:29:33.457
PERSONAL BELIEVE FOR RELIGIOUS

04:29:33.524 --> 04:29:35.125
BELIEF AND THE WORD COULD EASILY

04:29:35.192 --> 04:29:36.126
GO AROUND IS THAT WOULD AND

04:29:36.193 --> 04:29:37.861
SOCIAL MEDIA THAT THESE ARE THE

04:29:37.928 --> 04:29:39.363
MAGIC WORDS.

04:29:39.429 --> 04:29:42.432
WE FEEL THAT THE RANGERS NEED A

04:29:42.499 --> 04:29:43.467
LITTLE BIT MORE.

04:29:43.534 --> 04:29:44.835
WE THINK THAT JUST A MINOR PER

04:29:44.902 --> 04:29:46.403
MINOR AMENDMENT TO THIS PROPOSAL

04:29:46.470 --> 04:29:48.505
TO TAKE OUT THE WORD BELIEVE AND

04:29:48.572 --> 04:29:50.841
PUT IN SOME LANGUAGES SAYS THE

04:29:50.908 --> 04:29:52.309
GOOD FAITH EXERCISE OF A

04:29:52.376 --> 04:29:54.845
RELIGIOUS PRACTICE OR CEREMONY.

04:29:54.912 --> 04:29:56.680
WOULD GIVE RANGERS THAT TOOL.

04:29:56.747 --> 04:29:58.215
THE REASON IS EVEN PRACTICE AND
