WE'RE HOLDING OUR COMMITTEE HEARING TODAY IN THE OLD STREET BUILDING. AND I ASKED ALL MY MEMBERS ON THE COMMITTEE- TO MAKE THEIR WAY TO TWENTY TWO HUNDRED SO WE CAN STOP THE CORPSMAN BEGAN OUR HEARINGS. WE HAVE ELEVEN BILLS- OUT TODAY TO WHICH- ON CONSENT S. B. ELEVEN THIRTY SEVEN BY SENATOR ACHEN TO NOT SPEAK THIRTEEN FIFTY NINE BY SENATOR WAY SO. AND SP TEN SEVENTY TWO BY SENATOR DOLLY HAS BEEN POURED FROM TODAY'S AGENDA. SO I WE WILL HEAR TESTIMONY- RIGHT NOW AGAIN LACKING A QUORUM BUT WE WILL HEAR. WE HAVE SENATOR BACKER YOU PREPARED. YES YOU YOUR FIRST ITEM IS S. B. ONE THOUSAND. MR SHARE. RESCUE ONE THOUSAND WILL PROTECT THE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS THAT'S REPORT AS WELL AS THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE COMMUNICATIONS VIA POLICE RADIO COMMUNICATIONS SERVER ON THEIR COMMUNITIES THE POLICE RADIO COMMUNICATIONS ACCESS FOR SEVENTY PLUS YEARS NEWS OUTLETS JOURNALIST A PUBLIC HAD ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION. IN ITS GRIPPING PORT FOR TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY- AND REPORTING PUBLIC SAFETY ACTIVITY TO THE PUBLIC. UNFORTUNATELY RIGHT NOW THERE IS AN ALARMING TREND OCCURRING IN CALIFORNIA. WHICH HAS FOR POLICE DEPARTMENTS MOVING TO FULLY G. CRAFT THAT'S OUR FULLY ENCRYPTED WERE BLOCKED THE READING COMMUNICATIONS. IN THE NAME OF PROTECTING- PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT WE CAN IN FACT PROTECT PRIVATE INFORMATION WITHOUT PUTTING THE PUBLIC IN THE DARK IF YOU CHRISTIAN. SO THIS BILL SB ONE THOUSAND SIMULTANEOUS GRANTS OPTIONS AND FLEXIBILITY FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE'RE CONSIDERING UPGRADING THE RADIO COMMUNICATIONS. AND PROJECT AND PROTECTING THIS COUNTRY FROM NATION WE SPOKE WITH POLICE CHIEFS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT LEADERS LOCALLY AND EVERYONE MUST BE TRANSPARENT IN THE RADIOCOMMUNICATIONS BUT ALSO BE COMPLIANT. WITH A PRIVACY PROTECTIONS. SO WHICH MAKE IT CLEAR THAT'S A FALSE CHOICE TO SAY DEPARTMENTS MUST SPEND MILLIONS TO ENCRYPT BLOCK ALL ACCESS THANK YOU SIR- YOU KNOW WORK LEAST PUBLIC INFORMATION THERE IS A THIRD OPTION WHICH WILL TALK ABOUT A BIT FULL OF CORRUPTION IS ONLY STREAM IT'S NOT NECESSARY IF AT THIS POINT WE SEE SUPPORT FOR PRIVACY ORGANIZATIONS STATING THIS AS WELL. AND WE BELIEVE WE FOUND THE RIGHT BALANCE HERE FOR EXAMPLE ARE THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL HAS FIGURED THIS OUT UPON RECEIVING THE DOJ'S GUIDANCE IN TWENTY TWENTY TO SEE SPEAK QUICKLY AND CHEAPLY ADOPTED A POLICY TO TRAIN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND DISPATCHERS TO PROTECT. SO I DEFINITELY PERMISSION AND THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO KNOW. THE CSP POLICY MEETS OUR REQUIREMENTS OF DEPARTMENTS CAN DO THE SAME. I APPLAUD THE USE OF WEB PORTAL AND SOCIAL MEDIA TECH TOOLS BY POLICE. BUT THOSE ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO GRANT TRUE OUT LIVE AT TRANSPARENCY. A FORMER ACCESS PLEASE ACTIVITIES NOT OPERATIONAL CHANGE THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN WITHOUT INPUT FROM THE PUBLIC ELECTED OFFICIALS AS IT FORCES BEEN HAPPENING NOW. IN DOZENS OF CITIES. ACROSS OUR STATE. NOW CERTAINLY NOT TE TIME TO STRICT ACCESS TO POLICE RADIO IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND WHILE MANY POLICE DEPARTMENTS HAVE A GOOD FAITH MADE THIS TRANSITION TO FOR CORRUPTION IT'S NOT UP TO US TO CORRECT THAT MISTAKE ENSURE CONSISTENCY- AS WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THIS BILL SO. THEY'RE WORKING WITH CLOSE WITH YOU A DOJ AND A HOST OF STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES DEPARTMENTS JOURNALISTS BROADCASTERS ADVOCATES WE CONTINUE HAVE CANDIDA PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS. WITH OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS SO WHEN IT THANK- OUR SPONSORS ACCOMPANY NEWS PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA BROADCASTERS ASSOCIATION.

TO BRIEFLY SHARE WITH YOU WHY I STRONGLY SUPPORT SB ONE THOUSAND. I'M JENNIFER SEELIG DIRECTOR OF NEWS AND PROGRAMMING FOR KCBS ALL NEWS RADIO WHICH BROADCASTS LIVE FROM THE BAY AREA TWENTY FOUR SEVEN. WE ARE THE PRIMARY OR L. P. ONE EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM STATION. I OPENED ALSO REPRESENT JOURNALISTS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AS A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF RTDNA THE RADIO TELEVISION DIGITAL NEWS ASSOCIATION. JOURNALISTS HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO INFORM THE PUBLIC DURING NATURAL DISASTERS. MASS SHOOTINGS. OTHER MAJOR NEWS EVENTS. SCANNER COMMUNICATION IS CRUCIAL TO OUR NEWS GATHERING EFFORT. WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT FIRST RESPONDERS ARE DOING IN REAL TIME. THE DECISION BY A NUMBER OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO FULLY ENCRYPT THEIR COMMUNICATIONS. GREATLY LIMITS THE ABILITY OF JOURNALISTS TO SERVE THE PUBLIC. WE ALSO RELY ON SCANNER COMMUNICATION TO STAY SAFE IN THE FIELD. NEWS CREWS ARE INCREASINGLY TARGETED WENT ON ASSIGNMENT. SCANNER TRAFFIC ALSO CLARIFY FOR JOURNALISTS WE'RE NOT TO GO. SO THAT WE DON'T ACCIDENTALLY INTERRUPT OR INTERFERE WITH AN EMERGENCY OPERATION. DURING UNDERSTAND AND RESPECT THE SENSITIVE NATURE OF SCANNER COMMUNICATION. AS AN INDUSTRY STANDARD WE DO NOT REPORT UNCONFIRMED OR PRIVATE INFORMATION FROM RADIO TRANSMISSION. WE USE THIS INFORMATION TO MAKE COVERAGE DECISIONS. WE BELIEVE THERE ARE BETTER OPTIONS THAN FULL ENCRYPTION TO BALANCE THE INDIVIDUAL'S RIGHT TO PRIVACY AND THE PUBLIC'S NEED NOW. SB ONE THOUSAND IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO THE SAFETY SECURITY AND WELL BEING OF THE PUBLIC AND WORKING JOURNALISTS. I AM PROUD TO PROVIDE. MY SUPPORT THANK YOU TESTING COME.

AND OUR JOURNALISTS RELY ON A REGULAR BASIS TO BE ABLE TO- UP ON THESE RADIO ENCRYPTION SO BE ABLE TO REPORT ON THE ACTIVE ONGOING DEVELOPING SITUATIONS. THAT ARE CRUCIAL TO MAKING SURE THE PUBLIC HAS ACCURATE INFORMATION AND CAN REMAIN SAFE WHEN THESE TYPES OF SITUATIONS ARE ONGOING. I WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS BILL SIMPLY CLARIFIES THE DOJ MEMO IN OUR PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE IT ALL UP IT CLARIFIES THAT THE OPTIONS SHORT OF FULL ENCRYPTION HELP STRIKE THAT APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN PERSONAL INFORMATION AND ENSURING THAT THE PUBLIC HAS ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED AND OUT SO. WE'VE RESPECTFULLY OR DRIVE OUT. THANK YOU NOW WE'LL GO TO OUR MODERATOR ARE THEIR COLLARS ONLINE WISHING TO SUPPORT US SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB ONE THOUSAND. MODERATOR. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT PLEASE PRESS ONE AND ZERO. WE DO HAVE A COUPLE PEOPLE DIALING IN. IN LINE THIRTY SIX YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD LUCK WITH CALDWELL HOUSTON FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU THE QUICKNESS. THANK YOUR MIND TWENTY YOUR LINE IS OPEN. HI JACKIE WITH OPEN PRIVACY IN SUPPORT OF SB ONE THOUSAND. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND ONE MOMENT WE DO HAVE ONE OTHER PERSON IN Q. LINE THIRTY SEVEN YOUR LINE IS OPEN. STRAWBERRY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA BROADCASTERS ASSOCIATION A COALITION COMPRISED OF THE NATIONAL PRESS PHOTOGRAPHERS ASSOCIATION THE RADIO TELEVISION NEWS DIGITAL ASSOCIATIONS YORK COUNTY PRESS CLUB THE SAN DIEGO CHAPTER OF THE SOCIETY OF PROFESSIONAL JOURNALISTS THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF BLACK JOURNALISTS THE SOCIETY OF PROFESSIONAL JOURNALISTS LOS ANGELES THE ONLINE NEWS ASSOCIATION AND THE FIRST AMENDMENT COALITION AND STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU. AND THERE'S NO ONE IN Q. THANK YOU I FEEL DALLAS IS THERE ANY ONE HERE PRESIDENT THAT IS ALSO IN SUPPORT OF SB ONE THOUSAND OTHER THAN A WITNESS ARTISTS BOOK ARTANE NINE NOW WILL MOVE TO OPPOSITION- THEY WILL BE ENTITLED TO FOUR MINUTES FOR THE PRIMARY WITNESS IN OPPOSITION- WHICH SELLS AUTO PLEASE WELCOME. MORE MATURE MEMBERS COURCELLES ALONE BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION RESPECTIVELY IN OPPOSITION TO THE MEASURE AS YOU KNOW AND AS WAS MENTIONED IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY TWENTY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ISSUED GUIDANCE- THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES USE THAT USE CLASS RE REAFFIRMING STATE AND FEDERAL POLICY ABOUT PROTECTING BOTH CRIMINAL JUSTICE INFORMATION AND PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION IN SHORT THE BULLETIN SAYS THAT YOU CAN EITHER ENCRYPT YOUR RADIO TRAFFIC OR DEVELOP POLICIES TO RESTRICT DISSEMINATION OF SPECIFIC TYPES OF INFORMATION. TO COMPLY WITH THIS REQUIREMENT. THAT'S BEEN IN PLACE UNDERSTAND FEDERAL LAW SOME AGENCIES HAVE ENCRYPTED THEIR RADIO COMMUNICATIONS. THIS BILL DEFAULTS TO UNENCRYPTED RADIO COMMUNICATIONS WHICH MEANS THERE WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT BURDEN ON AGENCIES THAT WANT TO TREMENDOUS EXPENSE TO DEVELOP THE NEW TECHNOLOGY- OR HAVE PREVIOUSLY ENCRYPTED THEIR COMMUNICATIONS TO SWITCH BACK TO UNENCRYPTED RADIO COMMUNICATIONS. WILL REQUIRE COSTLY AND TIME TIME CONSUMING TRAINING IN ORDER TO PROTECT BOTH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE INFORMATION AND THE PERSONAL IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. ALSO THE BILLS CONTEMPLATION OF USING ALTERNATE NON BROADCASTING ALTERNATIVES TO RADIO TECHNOLOGY MAY NOT BE EASY EASY OR ACHIEVABLE IN ALL LOCATIONS- BECAUSE OF UNAVAILABLE CELL SERVICE OR COMPUTERS THAT CAN'T CONNECT- SWITCHING TO ENCRYPTED OR ALTERNATE. MEDIA IN TACTICAL UNDER COVER SITUATIONS WILL LIKELY COMPLICATE ALREADY COMPLEX AND OREOS. THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROLS IN A DIFFERENT SITUATION THEY USE DIFFERENT RADIOS BECAUSE THEY'RE REQUIRED TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE OVER DIFFERENT DISTANCES THAN MORE SMALLER AGENCIES- THOSE TECHNOLOGIES THEY HAVE TO STAY ON WHAT'S CALLED THE LOW BAND AS OPPOSED TO THE HIGH BAND WHICH ALLOWS FOR ENCRYPTION. SO THE C. H. P. ISN'T KIND OF A DIFFERENT BOAT WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT IT LOOKS pENFORCEMENT AGENCIES SO NOT NOT A KNOCK ON THE HIGHWAY PATROL THEY JUST HAVE A DIFFERENT SITUATION SO. IT'S NOT REALLY A GOOD EXAMPLE OF WHAT'S A BAR HERE SO- WE ASK FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES HERE AND TWENTY TWO HUNDRED AND OPPOSITION. R. NOW WE'LL GO TO OUR PHONE LINES MODERATOR TO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES DESIRING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF SB ONE THOUSAND. THANK YOU AND IF YOU'RE IN A POSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO. AT THIS TIME NO ONE HAD QUEUED UP. OKAY WE'LL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS REGARDING THIS P. ONE THOUSAND CENTERS CAN BRADFORD- AND- SENDER BACKER FOR BRING THIS BILL- I APPRECIATE THE- THE WITNESS IN OPPOSITION- INDICATING THEIR OPPOSITION BUT I DID NOT GET FROM YOUR DESCRIPTION ANYTHING THAT WAS REALLY FUNDAMENTAL AS TO WHY THESE COMMUNICATIONS WOULD NEED THIS TYPE OF ENCRYPTION AND THUS BE- NOT ACCESSIBLE BY OUR MEDIA NETWORKS. AND YOU KNOW MAYBE THERE IS. MAYBE I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND BUT DID NOT SEEM TO BE IT'S THE KIND OF SITUATION WHERE IT SEEMS TO ME THE ONLY TIME THAT WE SHOULD. DO SUCH AN ENCRYPTION THAT WOULD BASICALLY PREVENT. OUR- YOU KNOW- JOURNALISTEN SUCH FROM BEING ABLE TO ACCESS IS IN REAL IN A REAL- PUBLIC SAFETY EMERGENCY AND WHEN I SEE REAL THAT'S KIND INADEQUATE BUT RATHER IT'S A LIFE OR DEATH TYPES OF SITUATIONS AND EVEN EITHER THE ANALYSIS OR THE DESCRIPTION REALLY COMMUNICATED THAT WEIRD THAT WOULD MIGHT BE THE CASE. AND- RIGHT- CENTER RECORD- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY YOU THINK THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT I THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE THIS AND YOU'RE PRESENTED IT BUT IS THERE ANY CIRCUMSTANCE THAT YOU CAN ANTICIPATE WHERE THEY ARE WERE THERE WOULD BE AN ASSESSEE TO HAVE SUCH AN ENCRYPTION. I'M NO WE DON'T WE DON'T FORESEE A SITUATION WHERE WE NEED FULL ENCRYPTION EFFECTIVELY TALK TO DOJ- THEY'RE THEY'RE VERY CLEAR ON THAT THAT FOCUS IS NOT REQUIRED NOW- WE'RE CERTAINLY URGING THEM AND THEY THEY- SAY THEY'VE BEEN CLEAR THAT. IT WAS REQUIRED ALL ALONG- AND THAT THAT THAT THIS IS AN ALTERNATIVE THAT- EVERYONE SHOULD VERY MUCH AVAIL THEMSELVES TO WORK. WHEN I CLEAR GUIDANCE WAS ALWAYS- CLEAR IN THE PAST FROM DOJ WERE STRONGLY URGING THEM TO. CONTINUE TO CLARIFY GOING FORWARD- BUT THEY HAVEN'T SAID OR NO ONE HAS SAID THAT THERE'S ANY. SITUATION WHERE YOU NEED TO HAVE FOR CORRUPTION. I'M I SUPPORT THE BILL AND- WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE I WOULD MOVE IT. THANK YOU SENATOR TROUBLED- GOOD MORNING THANK YOU TO MISTER CHAIR AND- THANK YOU SENATOR BAKER FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- BEING THAT I AM NOT AN pEXPERT IN OUR PUBLIC SAFETY AND LEARNING QUITE A BIT. I DO HAVE SOME WRITTEN STATEMENTS HERE THAT I WOULD LIKE TO- PUT IN THE RECORD. AND FIRST OF ALL MOST STRONG BELIEVER THE FIRST AMENDMENT VERY VERY MUCH SO AND I DO BELIEVE THAT OUR JOURNALISTS PLAIN IMPORTANT PUBLIC SAFETY ROLE IN OUR SOCIETY AND I BELIEVE OUR CITIZENS HAVE A RIGHT TO REASONABLE ACCESS FOR PUBLICLY FUNDED INSTITUTIONS. HOWEVER I DO BELIEVE THAT OUR SMALLER POLICE DEPARTMENTS WHO HAVE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY. UPGRADING THEIR SYSTEMS FOLLOWING THE TWENTY TWENTY MEMO FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAVE A LEGITIMATE CONCERN. OVER THE ABILITY TO INSTITUTE ANOTHER OVERHAUL. TO THEIR SYSTEMS. CHANGE IT BACK TO THE F. TWINNING CRYPTID SYSTEM AS WELL AS THE CLUB'S PRIVATE CHANNEL WOULD BE EXTREMELY COSTLY. FOR- AND DIFFICULT FOR OUR POLICE DEPARTMENTS TO IMPLEMENT I DO UNDERSTAND THAT THE CHP HAS BEEN ABLE TO DEVELOP A MORE NEW WINCED OUR SYSTEM THAT THREAD THE NEEDLE BETWEEN PRIVACY CONCERNS AND LEGITIMATE PUBLIC ACCESS. THE CHP IS A STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION WITH CONSIDERABLE MORE FUNDING THAN MANY OF OUR LOCAL DEPARTMENTS WHO STRUGGLE TO MAKE ENDS MEET. AND HAVE YOU CONSIDERED A FUNDED PILOT PROGRAM FOR POLICE DEPARTMENTS TO LOOK AT THE BEST WAY TO IMPLEMENT A MORE BALANCED COMMUNICATION SYSTEM SIMILAR TO WHAT THE CHP HAS. BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH SO THAT THERE IS A MODEL FOR SMALLER DEPARTMENTS TO FOLLOW. WELL I THINK ONE OF THE THAT IT'S ACTUALLY MUCH CHEAPER TO NOT FULLY CRAP SO FOR EXAMPLE SAN BRUNO IN MY- IN MY DISTRICT IS REACHING OUT FOR FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO MOVE IN LARGE PART JUST TO MOVE TO A- FULL QUESTION BECAUSE THAT WAS THEIR INTERPRETATION OF THE DOJ MEMO. AND WHICH IS WHAT WE THINK DJ CLARIFYING THAT EARLIER WOULD BE WOULD BE BETTER- BUT THAT'S- SWEAT WHILE WE THINK THIS BILL IS NECESSARY BECAUSE WE TELL THEM- IT WAS REALLY OUR JOB TO TELL THEM THAT- ACTUALLY YOU PROBABLY DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT RIGHT AND THAT IF I DON'T SPEND ANYTHING. AND IT'S ACTUALLY VERY CHEAP WAYS TO MOVE FORWARD AND JUST MAKE SURE LIKE CHP HAS DONE- TO MAKE SURE THAT PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION IS NOT GOING OUT THERE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF. OF OF WAYS TO DO THAT SO I APPRECIATE YOUR SUGGESTION BUT I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR LOOKING CHP WORK YOU KNOW MANY OTHER AGENCIES WERE DOING AT THAT THERE ARE WAYS TO JUST MAKE SURE THE PERSONAL INFORMATION DOESN'T GO OUT. ON UNDER THE CURRENT CURRENT CHANNEL SO I DON'T I PIECES YES I DON'T THINK WE NEED A PILOT TO SHOW THAT- AND I THINK THIS BILL IS NEEDED BECAUSE ONE MAKE SURE MORE POLICE DEPARTMENT DOES BUT ALL THE MONEY TO MOVE TO FOREIGN CORRUPTION WHICH- AGAIN WE THINK IT'S NOT NECESSARY AND- HARMFUL TO THE PUBLIC. THEN I HAVE. ONE MORE QUESTION SIR MISTER CHAIR. I'M ALSO. MY UNDERSTANDING THAT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE SCANNERS THAT CAN MONITOR- READER TRAFFIC PLUS WHAT NARCOTICS AND GANG UNITS USED ENCRYPTION DURING THEIR OPERATIONS- AND THEN THEY CAN ALSO SUBPOENA RADIO TRAFFIC AS WELL SO THE PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY HAVE ACCESS TO ALL OF THIS INFORMATION BASED ON MANY SCANNERS. I WAS ADVISED TO GO INTO THE APP STORE AND SEE HOW MANY AT LEAST SCANNERS WERE AVAILABLE- FOR PEOPLE TO USE AN EVERYDAY BASIS AND THE CONCERN THAT HAS ARISEN IS THAT WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE IT A LITTLE EASIER TO HAVE. THE VARIOUS ACTORS NO WITH THE MOVE BY MOVE OR AFP OUT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION OR STRATEGY INFORMATION BY OUR POLICE DEPARTMENTS GIVE ANY FEEDBACK ON THE- BUT MIGHT ASK MORE MY WITNESSES WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT I THINK IT'S EASIER FOR YOUR FIRST POINT- I THINK WITH FOR CORRUPTION THE PUBLIC'S NOT GETTING INFORMATION AND I THINK THE WITNESSES. THAT COULD SPEAK TO THAT- IN TERMS OF- YOU KNOW. BAD ACTORS I THINK WHAT I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THEY CAN BE THE BAD ACTORS CAN GET INFORMATION WHETHER CERTAIN GROUPS THAT ARE NOT- SO I CAN'T QUITE COMMENT ON THAT I DON'T THINK. I DON'T THINK THAT THIS BILL WILL- AGAIN BECAUSE WE MAKE SURE PERCENT AFFIRMATION IS NOT. IS NOT GETTING OUT- WE'LL BE ANY WILL CREATE ANY ADDITIONAL DANGERS TO. TO THE TO THE PUBLIC BUT BUT JUST WHEN THE WITNESSES ONE ADDRESS EITHER EITHER THOSE POINTS. JENNIFER FEEL LIKE I WOULD SIMPLY SAY I THINK YOU KNOW YOU'VE HAD IT SPOT ON YOU'RE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND YOUR ASSESSMENT I'M HAPPY TO EXPLORE THIS TOPIC FURTHER IF YOU HAVE MORE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT IT. BRITAIN'S GOOD MORNING AND- SO AS TO THE LATTER PART OF THE QUESTION THERE WAS ASKED ABOUT- NEFARIOUS ACTORS BEING ABLE TO MONITOR SO THE BILL LANGUAGE DOES CONTAIN AN EXEMPTION FOR UNDERCOVER OPERATIONS AND OTHER ISSUES- ISSUES THAT WOULD BE COVERED I BELIEVE UNDER YOUR QUESTIONS SO THAT'S A DRESSED IN THE BILL LANGUAGE HOW DOES THAT ACTUALLY LOOK I APOLOGIZE. THAT THIS REPORT BUT YES OUR FOOTFALL. YOUR SO HOW DOES THAT LOOK IN PRACTICE HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY PROTECTIVE GEAR HAVE RIDDLED THE AXIS AND HOW DOES THAT. RETIRED ACTUAL PRACTICE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE UNDER COVER OR- ATTACKED. THE SYSTEM FROM THE VARIOUS ACTORS. SO TO BE FAIR I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON THE POLICE END OF THINGS- WE ARE NEWS ORGANIZATIONS MONITOR THE ENCRYPTION FOR THE PENAL CODE DOES ALSO MAKE IT A CRIME TO SHARE ANY INFORMATION THAT'S ONGOING THAT WOULD AID IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITY THAT'S AN EXISTING LAW WASN'T NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS. I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT PERSPECTIVE BUT IN PRACTICE WHEN YOU WANT TO HAVE READILY AVAILABLE INFORMATION IT'S JUST ME I JUST WOULD LIKE TO SEE HOW. THE SYSTEM IN PLACE TO BE- PROTECTED FROM HAVING FULL ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION AS ITS ON GOING. LIVE FROM THE NEFARIOUS ACTORS KNOWING THIS THE STEP BY STEP STRATEGIES FIRE PUBLIC SAFETY. I JUST I I'M ALL ABOUT THE FIRST AMENDMENT BUT I'M ALSO WHEN IT COMES TO PUBLIC SAFETY- BOTH LOCAL AND FEDERAL I'M VERY VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT PROTECTING BOTH THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE TRYING TO. PROTECT OUR SAFETY ON ON BOTH LEVELS AS WELL AS- THE STRATEGIES IN WHICH THEY'RE WORKING IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO- PROCEED WITH THEIR- TRANSACTION PER SE- THAT'S THAT WAS THERE. THE INTENT OF MY QUESTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS- WINNER YEAH RESEARCH CONTRACT FACT. ALL RIGHT BOSTON REBEKAH THANK YOU FOR I THINK A STRAIGHTFORWARD MEASURE- YES PUBLIC SAFETY IS A WHILE LAW ENFORCEMENT SECURITY IS OF THE UTMOST CONCERN ALL OF US HERE BUT I THINK ALSO ACCESS TO. PUBLIC INFORMATION TRANSPARENCY IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE HERE I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT- pMORE TRANSPARENT USE BETTER ALWAYS REGARD TO WHAT PART OF GOVERNMENT SURE AND SO I APPLAUD YOU FOR THOSE IN THE FUTURE NO OTHER QUESTIONS REMEMBERS ALL OF YOUR CLOTHES. YEAH THANKS TO SET IT BEGAN WE'RE JUST RESTORING WHAT WAS IN PLACE FOR SEVENTY YEARS SO- WE'RE NOT QUITTING ANY REALLY NEW ACCESS SO THAT THE LAWS WERE IN PLACE WE'RE NOT REPLACING CORRUPTION I THINK TO JUST TO EUROPE WHEN SENATOR BROKE UP WERE NOT PUT TOO BECAUSE OF PROTECTION DIVERSE ACTORS WHICH IS WITH THIS CONCERN I'M PROUD OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DRESS YOUR MAKE SURE THAT WE PROTECT PERSONAL INFORMATION WHILE ALSO RESTORING A PUBLIC ACCESS WHAT THEY'VE HAD FOR SEVEN YEARS. SO WITHOUT A STRICTLY ASTRONAUT.

RIGHT GOOD MORNING SHARE BRADFORD AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS- MY NAME IS LESLIE CALDWELL. ONE ACCOUNTING PUBLIC DEFENDER AND A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION I AM SPEAKING TO YOU TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB ELEVEN SEVENTEEN ON BEHALF OF THE PDA AND AS A FORMER PUBLIC DEFENDER HAVING RUN IN MEDIUM SIZED PUBLIC DEFENDER OF THE- F. B. ELEVEN SEVENTEEN WOULD AUTHORIZE THE STATE PUBLIC DEFENDER THE LX P. D. TO AWARD. MINISTER GRANTS TO IMPROVE INDIGENT DEFENSE SERVICES. CURRENTLY MOST INDIGENT DEFENSE GRANTS ARE ADMINISTERED BY THE BOARD OF STATE OKAY MUNITY CORRECTION TO BE FCC. THE V. FEC ALREADY HAVE MANY RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDING MANY STATE GRANT. THE OFFICE OF THE STATE PUBLIC DEFENDER HAS THE NEWLY CREATED INDIGENOUS IMPROVEMENT DIVISION. THAT HAVE EXPERTISE IN WORKING WITH INDIGENT DEFENSE ORGANIZATION IN OUR STATE AND UNDERSTAND HOW GRANT MONEY WOULD BE MOST BENEFICIAL TO THE CLIENT- BY PUBLIC. DEFENDERS AND APPOINTED COUNSEL. IN GIVE ME AN DEFENSE MAY ARE VERY GOOD THROUGHOUT FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES OF CAL FROM URBAN TO RURAL SPARSELY POPULATED TO HEAVILY POPULATED- FTD IS UNIQUELY SITUATED TO AWARD GRANTS TO THESE DIFFERENT AGENCIES. FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF INDIGENT DEFENSE FOR ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES. AFTER DIRECTOR OF A MEDIUM SIZED PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE I STRUGGLED MIGHTILY OVER YEARS TO GET THE FUNDING I NEEDED TO SERVE OUR CLIENTS. I WOULD SUMMARILY DISMISSED MANY TIMES BY THE COUNTY ADMINISTRATOR WHEN I ASKED FOR THE MONEY I NEEDED TO ADEQUATELY SERVE OUR CITIZENS. THE FACT THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR SAW THE NEED AND THE DRESS DID OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS WE'RE QUITE CERTAINLY A LIFESAVER FOR MANY. NOW IS THE TIME TO ENSURE THAT THOSE PRECIOUS FUNDS ARE NOT USUALLY KNOWLEDGEABLY AND EFFICIENTLY. DISPERSED BY N. H. WITH THE X. TO MAKE A LITTLE GO TO ADMINISTER. AND MOST OF THE MONEY GOES TO THE INDIGENT DEFENSE SERVICES THEY ARE THE MOST IN NEED AND BEST ABLE TO SERVE. OUR COMMUNITIES BY AUTHORIZING THE STATE PUBLIC DEFENDER TO DIRECTLY ADMINISTER GRANTS THE PROCESS BY WHICH MONEY IS DIRECTED IN OVERSEEING WILL BE MORE STREAMLINED AND GET TO THE RECIPIENTS OF THE GRANTS FASTER.

YOU KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF COMMITTEES TODAY. BUT HERE WE ARE IN PUBLIC SAFETY SO THAT'S WHAT WE'LL TALK ABOUT NOW. THAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT. AS P. TWELVE OH NINE TODAY. I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING ON THE AMENDMENTS IN ALCESTER CORRECTED DRAFTING ERROR- AND THIS WILL BE A FAMILIAR ISSUE- TOO MANY OF YOU BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN SIMILAR BILLS BEFORE MOST RECENTLY CENTER MEN'S BILL THAT PASSES COMMITTEE YOU MANAGED FOR THE LAST YEAR. SPIE SEVEN SIXTY THREE AND THIS YEAR HE AND I PARTNERED ON S. P. TWELVE OH NINE THE KEY POINT OF THIS BILL IS TO ENSURE THAT VETERANS THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED TRAUMA RELATED TO THEIR MILTARY SERVICE. ARE PROVIDED WITH SENTENCING MITIGATION- ED ED RELATED TO THE TRAUMA IF THEY HAVE ALREADY PASSED INTO LAW SO THIS IS FOR RESENTENCING THIS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN CONNECT CONVICTED- TO WHEN THEY GO BACK FOR RE SENTENCING SO THAT THE BILL THAT WE PASSED LEFT OU A MASSIVE. AMOUNT OF PEOPLE- VETERANS FOR WHO TO WHOM THIS WOULDN'T APPLY DID IN THE LAST YEAR HAS BEEN APPLIED UNEVENLY TO THE EXTENT THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT JUDGE JUSTIN- JUST AS GOOD WHEN LUKE NOTED THAT THE SECTION THE LAW FAILS TO ENSURE EQUAL TREATMENT OF ALL VETERANS. HE ADDED THAT THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE HAS RECOGNIZED THE LATE ONSET PTSD PARTICULARLY AMONG VETERANS WERE SYMPTOMS CAN TAKE TIME TO FULLY MANIFEST AND THAT THE B. ADMINISTRATION ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS CAN SUBSTANTIALLY DELAY. VERIFICATION OF THE MITIGATING FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH TRAUMA- AS CASES HAVE CONTINUED TO COME BEFORE THE COURT JUST AS I LEAN MORE WHO WE WORKED ON HAS PROVIDED A STATEMENT TO THIS COMMITTEE LAST YEAR HAS CONTINUED TO IDENTIFY WAYS THAT THE LAW. IS APPLIED UNEVENLY. B. O. THE REG. ISSUES S. B. TWELVE OH NINE INCORPORATES HIS ISSUES AS WELL TO ENSURE THAT THE STIPULATED SENTENCES. UNDER PLEA AGREEMENTS ARE INCLUDED. WE'VE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF TRAUMA. AND HOW LONG SYMPTOMS CAN TAKE TO MANIFEST AND HOW THEY CAN ALTER THINKING. AND BEHAVIOR. AT THIS BILL ENSURES THAT THOSE WITH TRAUMA FROM THEIR HONORABLE MILITARY SERVICE AND SACRIFICE ARE PROVIDED WITH THAT CONSIDERATION WE'VE ALREADY PASSED INTO LAW. AT THIS POINT THE BILL HAS NO OPPOSITION AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. VOTE WITH ME TODAY- TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. IS GLENN VALIANT AND- GREG FIDEL ON BEHALF OF THE INITIATIVE INITIATE JUSTICE. YOU'RE WELCOME TO MINUTES EACH. MR VALIANT OR MR FADELL IF YOU'RE READY- YOU'RE HERE PRESENT THANK YOU YES SIR. HI GOOD MORNING TEN MEMBERS MY NAME IS GREGORY FIDEL AND THE POLICY DIRECTOR FOR INITIATE JUSTICE. WE ARE PLEASED TO SUPPORT SB TWELVE OH NINE AND WE THANK SENATORS ADMIN AND MEN FOR BRINGING THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. AS A SENATOR MENTIONED THE LEGISLATURE HAS MADE PROGRESS IN RECOGNIZING. AND RECOGNIZING THE IMPACT THAT MILITARY SERVICE CAN HAVE ON MENTAL HEALTH AND HOW TRAUMA AFFECTS LATER DECISIONS AND ACTIONS. HOWEVER THERE ARE STILL VETERANS THAT ARE CURRENTLY INCARCERATED WHO'VE BEEN LEFT OUT OF THIS IMPORTANT RELIEF. THIS LEGISLATION HAS CREATED BARRIERS FOR SOME SERVICE MEMBERS. WHO ARE DIAGNOSED WITH PTSD SUBSTANCE ABUSE OR OTHER MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS AFTER INITIAL SENTENCING. FURTHER VETERANS WHO TOOK PLEA DEALS OR RECEIVED INDETERMINATE SENTENCES WERE NOT ALLOWED TO BENEFIT FROM THESE POSITIVE CHANGES A LOT. AT THE CENTER ALSO MENTIONED CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT JUSTICE GOODWIN LIU CALLED OUT THIS RETROACTIVITY ISSUE JUST LAST YEAR THIS BILL PROVIDES A SOLUTION. TO BE CLEAR THIS BILL IS NOT A GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD NOR IS IT A SECOND BITE OF THE APPLE THIS IS ENSURING A FAIR FIRST BITE OF THE APPLE FOR A POPULATION THAT IS SACRIFICED EVERYTHING FOR THIS COUNTRY. THIS BILL DOESN'T COST TOO MUCH IN THIS DOESN'T LEAD TO UNSUBSTANTIATED CLAIMS GETTING AIRED OUT IN COURT. THERE ARE PLENTY OF MENTAL HEALTH RECORDS THAT CAN BE REFERENCED BY THE VA OR CDCR FOR EXAMPLE. WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE ALL VETERANS ARE RECEIVING EQUAL TREATMENT UNDER THE LAW. WE ALSO NEED TO PLUG GAPS IN CORRECT INCONSISTENCIES WHERE THEY EXIST. THIS MEASURE DOES EXACTLY THAT. THANK YOU AND I URGE I VOTE TODAY. GREAT MR VALUE AND SHOULD BE ON THE LINE OR IN PERSON YES I AM OKAY. YOU MAY BEGIN. GOOD MORNING SENATORS MY NAME'S CLAIM VALUE I LIVE IN COSTA MESA I'M A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER. I AM THE FATHER OF A VETERAN I HAVE LIVED THE DEVASTATING IMPACT MENTAL HEALTH INJURIES HAD ON MY SON'S LIFE. HE AVERAGED MIX SPECIAL FORCES MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY STRONG HE HAD A CONSTABLE CONFIDENCE BUT HE DIDN'T QUITE SEEM THE SAME WHEN HE CAME HOME. I BELIEVE HE WOULD OVERCOME WHATEVER WAS BOTHERING HIM I WASN'T CONCERNED AND I WAS WRONG STRUGGLE SLOWLY GOT MORE FREQUENT MORE PROBLEMATIC ONE DAY SOMETHING BAD HAPPENED AND THEN IT WAS TOO LATE SEEING MY STRONG CAPABLE SON SO BROKEN WAS INCREDIBLY PAINFUL. I'VE OFTEN THOUGHT IF ONLY HE HADN'T JOINED THE MILITARY WE WOULD NOT BE WHERE WE ARE TODAY I DON'T REGRET THIS SERVICE I'M PROUD OF IT. THINGS JUST TURNED OUT BADLY AND HERE WE ARE. P. THREE ELEVEN SEVENTY DOT NINE ONE WAS DESIGNED SO THOSE VETERANS WHO SUSTAINED MENTAL HEALTH INJURIES AS A RESULT OF THEIR SERVICE. RECEIVE MITIGATING CONSIDERATION AT SENTENCING. YOU DESERVE IT IT IS RIGHT. CORRECT A PROVISION WAS ADDED SO THOSE IMPACTED VETERANS WHO HAD NEVER RECEIVED CONSIDERATION WOULD BE ALLOWED TO RESENTENCING HEARING AND THAT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. THAT LET'S GO BACK TO PETITION HAS NOT WORKED FOR ALL IMPACTED VETERANS MANY HAVE BEEN DENIED RESENTENCING FOR A NUMBER OF UNFORESEEN REASONS. S. B. TWELVE OH NINE ADDRESSES THOSE REASONS IT ENSURES ALL IMPACTED VETERANS WHO HAVE NEVER RECEIVED CONSIDERATION WILL NOW FINALLY BE ABLE TO RECEIVE IT AND IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. SO I LEAVE YOU WITH THIS PEOPLE OFTEN SAY I SUPPORT OUR VETERANS AND I BELIEVE MOST PEOPLE WHO SAY IT BELIEVE IT. S. B. TWELVE OR NINE PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW THAT SUPPORT SO I'M ASKING YOU TO VOTE YES ON THE BILL AND MOVE IT TO THE NEXT COMMITTEE WITH. YOUR STRONGEST RECOMMENDATION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONCERN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CUSTOMER NOW WILL GO TO THIS ROOM TWENTY TWO HUNDRED IS THERE ANYONE WISHING TO TESTIFY COME RIGHT OUT.

DIVERSION PROGRAMS BE AVAILABLE FOR ALL MISDEMEANOR CRIMES INCLUDING DO YOU EYES SINCE THAT TIME MANY OF US WAS EXPRESSED THE NEED FOR STRICT GUIDELINES FOR INSURERS SERIAL DO YOU WHY OFFENDERS ARE AVOIDING PENALTIES OR ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THEIR CRIMES. ADDITIONALLY A RECENT STATE APPELLATE COURT DECISION RULED AGAINST. DIVERSION PROGRAMS FOR MISDEMEANOR. DO YOU I. CONVICTIONS OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS DO YOU I FREAKED FATALITIES HAVE RISEN SHARPLY THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA ALL OF WHICH WERE COMPLETELY PREVENTABLE. IN FACT CALIFORNIA RANKS ABOVE THE NATION'S AVERAGE OUR NATIONAL AVERAGE FOR D. U. I. FAALITIES WITH FATALITIES INCREASING 8% OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THIS LEGISLATURE TO PRESCRIBE SMART STANDARDS FOR D. U. I. DIVERSION PROGRAMS THAT WILL HELP REHABILITATE OFFENDERS REDUCE RECIDIVISM AND PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY. TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AND MAKE OUR STREETS SAFER S. B. TEN TWENTY ONE ITSELF IS A VIRGIN PROGRAM FOR FIRST TIME MR MEANER D. U. I. OFFENDERS. SPENCER ARE REQUIRED TO ENROLL IN A D. U. I. EDUCATION PROGRAM. ATTEND THE VICTIM'S IMPACT PANEL. AND INSTALL IN THE NEXT EDITION INTERLOCK DEVICE WHILE PARTICIPATING. IN THE DIVERSION PROGRAM. THESE NEW SAFEGUARDS WILL GIVE INDIVIDUALS THE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE AND LEARN FROM THEIR LOOK ACTIONS AND TO PREVENT SENSELESS TRAGEDIES CALLS BY DO YOU EYES IN CALIFORNIA.

DIVERSION STATUE SP TEN TWENTY ONE DOES THAT AND IT ENSURES THAT THERE ARE GUARDRAILS ON THE DO YOU WHY. DIVERSION LAW. MY SON MIDSHIPMAN MATTHEW GLOTZBACH WAS KILLED BECAUSE A DRUNK DRIVER. ON A SUSPENDED LICENSE SUSPENDED FIVE TIMES MADE THE CHOICE TO DRIVE DRUNK AGAIN. I WAS TRAPPED IN THE CAR AND INJURED MYSELF. AND I TRIED TO START IT MIGHT START CPR. BUT I COULD NOT. AS A NURSE WHO HAS WORKED AT A TRAUMA CENTER FOR THIRTY THREE PLUS YEARS I HAVE NEVER FELT SO HELPLESS. TO HEAR ANY EMPTY SAY THIS ONE HAS NO PULSE. S. B. TEN TWENTY ONE IS A COMPASSIONATE SMART JUSTICE PROPOSAL AND MATT'S VIEWPOINT THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT LEGISLATION THAT COULD HELP SAVE LIVES FROM DRUNK DRIVING IN CALIFORNIA SINCE POINT OH EIGHT B. AC BECAME LAW IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES. IT SHOULD BE CLEAR THAT S. B. TWENTY ONE IS NOT ABOUT PUNISHMENT. IT'S ABOUT PREVENTION IT'S A VACCINE ON THE CAR. IT IS ALSO ABOUT ENSURING EVERY CALIFORNIA DO YOU ARE A VENDOR IS GIVEN THE EQUAL CHANCE AT A DIVERSION. A BETTER CHANCE TO NOT BECOMING EVERY OFFENDER. WE KNOW WE CAN'T JUST SUSPEND DRIVER'S PRIVILEGES AND HOPE FOR THE BEST THIS FAILED APPROACH WAS PROVEN IN MY FAMILY'S LIFE INTERLOCKS ARE 74% MORE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING REPEAT DUI OFFENSES COMPARED TO A LICENSE SUSPENSION ALONE ACCORDING TO A TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA DMV STUDY. BY ENDING BY ENACTING SB TEN TWENTY ONE CALIFORNIA CONTINUE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS TOWARDS STOPPING DRUNK DRIVING.

WE HAVE OUT THERE WE'RE GONNA LAOS CENTER MAN AT THIS TIME TO PRESENT HIS MEASURE S. THIRTEEN EIGHTY FOUR SERMON WHEN YOU'RE RIGHT. THANK YOU JERRY BRADFORD MORNING MEMBERS OF COMMITTEE- SP THIRTEEN EIGHTY FOUR WILL STRENGTHEN GUN DEALER STANDARDS AND PROVIDE THE TOOLS NECESSARY TO HELP HELP PREVENT GUN TRAFFICKING. AS WELL AS TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL SECURITY STANDARDS TO PREVENT THAT FROM GUN RETAILERS. UNFORTUNATELY ILLEGAL GUNS IN THIS COUNTRY AND THE STATE OFTEN BEGAN AS LEGAL FIREARM PURCHASES THAT ARE THEN FUNNELED INTO THE LEGAL MARKET IN ILLEGAL MARKETS. ACCORDING TO DATA FROM THE GIFFORDS LAW CENTER TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE MORE THAN THIRTY THOUSAND STRAW PURCHASES ARE TEMPTED EACH YEAR. WHILE GUN DEALERS ARE CONSIDERED FIRST IN LINE TO MAINTAIN SECURE AND LAWFUL TRANSFER OF FIREARMS THERE IS NO CURRENT TRAINING REQUIREMENT FOR GUN DEALERS AND EMPLOYEES ON HOW TO RECOGNIZE SIGNS OF ILLEGAL ACTIVITY. THEFT FROM GUN RETAILERS IS ALSO A PERSISTENT PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA AND ANOTHER WAY FOR FIREARMS TO REACH THE ILLICIT MARKET. TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES SP THIRTEEN EIGHTY FOUR WOULD REQUIRE FIREARMS DEALERS AND EMPLOYEES THE COMPLETE REGULAR TRAINING TO PREVENT ILLEGAL SALES. AS WELL AS REQUIRE FIREARM DEALERS TO HAVE VIDEO SURVEILLANCE ALARMS PHYSICAL SECURITY MEASURES AND ALSO TO CARRY A GENERAL LIABILITY INSURANCE POLICY ALL COMMON SENSE MEASURES GIVEN. THE ROLE THAT GUNS IN ILLEGALLY PROCURED GUNS CAN PLAY IN CRIME. IN ADDITION I WILL ALSO BE ADOPTING THE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS THAT WERE RESULT OF NEGOTIATIONS AMONG STAKEHOLDERS. THESE AMENDMENTS WILL CLARIFY THAT AUDI CAN ONLY BE RECORDED INSIDE THE LICENSEES PROMISES AND NOT OUTSIDE. AND A GOOD FAITH EFFORTS WE MADE TO NOT VIDEO ACTIVITY BEYOND THE DIRECT LINES OF BUSINESS PROPERTY. IT WILL ALSO- THESE MINERALS ALSO ADD ADDITIONAL PARAMETERS ON USE OF AND ACCESS TO RECORDING TO MAKE SURE. THERE'S A HIGH BAR. HI REQUIREMENT IN ORDER TO GET ACCESS TO THESE I ALSO WILL INCLUDE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM OPERATION IN THE TRAINING REQUIREMENTS. NINE CONVERSATION WITH THE CHAIR'S OFFICE. A DRAFTING ERROR RELATED TO BEHAVIORAL PROFILE PROFILING AND DRUG TRAFFICKING WAS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION. INSTEAD OF DRUG TRAFFICKING LANGUAGE SHOULD HAVE SAID GUN TRAFFICKING. I'VE COMMITTED TO THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE WILL FIX THESE ISSUES AT THE NEXT OPPORTUNITY MEN AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THE ERROR. I KNOW OVERALL THIS MEASURE SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY FOUR WOULD STRENGTHEN SAFETY MEASURES FOR GUN RETAILERS AND PROVIDE TRAINING FOR GUN DEALERS TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THE TOOLS TO HELP PREVENT GUN TRAFFICKING CALIFORNIA. I HAVE GONE UP SHAH VIOLENCE INTERRUPTER FOR YOUTH ALIVE AND BRADY. AS WELL AS ANNETTE MILLER SURVIVOR AND WEST OAKLAND GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION ADVOCATE HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT S. B.

AT COORDINATOR FOR COMBAT HE- CRYING BECAUSE I NEED TO FOCUS ON HOW GREAT DOES IT MAKE THEIR WAY INTO THE COMMUNITY IT WAS BECAUSE OF THAT I SEE IN THE COMMUNITY THAT I LIVE HERE CREDIT BALANCE INTERRUPTED THE FAMILIES EVERY DAY. LIVES HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED BY GUN VIOLENCE THERE ARE TOO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE EXPOSED TO GUN OWNERS AND THAT VIOLENCE IT WAS DIRECTLY RESULT EASILY ACCESSIBLE TO GET GUNS. ELDER ELDERS STILL AS IF THEY'RE HELD HOSTAGE IN THEIR HOMES BECAUSE THERE. ARE SO MANY GUNS IN THE COMMUNITY. THERE DATE NOT FEEL SAFE ALL RIGHT YEAH ARE YOU FEEL A- IF THEY WILL MAKE A INTO THE BECAUSE OF THE GAP. GUN BY THEY ARE LIKE A IN STORY. PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY CAN ANSWER GUNS BUT NOT THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO A QUALITY LIFE. DOWNLOAD THIS TO NOR AND NO ONE HERE I FEEL LIKE THAT. THIS IS NO WAY TO LOOK A- BY ALARM DEALERS PLAY EIGHTEEN. IN PRE GUNS FROM BEING A TRAFFIC. JAM. THEY CAN PREVENT DANGER IS GUN SALES BUT RIGHT NOW THERE ARE NO FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT REQUIRE DEALERS TO PUT IN PLACE BASIC TRAINING SECURITY OR SAFETY MEASURES AS A RESULT INTERRUPTERS. AND OTHER FRONTLINE WORKERS LIKE ME- THE FOREST OR ALL OF THE EMPLOYEES TO COMPRESS BANDAGES AFFECTED BY GUN VIOLENCE IN OAKLAND. IT DID NOT HAVE. IT DID NOT TO BE WAY THERE ARE SOLUTIONS AND S. B. ONE THREE EIGHTY FOUR IS ONE OF THEM. THE SAY THE LEGISLATION WOULD STRIP IN GUN DEALERS STANDARDS OVERSIGHT AND SECURITY IT WOULD HELP PREVENT GUN TRAFFICKING. IT WOULD HELP DEALERS UNDERSTAND THEM THEY HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO PLEASE BOTH PAT COMPARES S. B. ONE EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT YEAH. THANK YOU. NOW WAS THERE ANOTHER NOT TO LOVE AND THAT MILLER ALL RIGHT WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU TWO MINUTES EVEN THOUGH YOUR FIRST WOULDN'T SUCCEED THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE KAMINSKI. HELLO. THANK YOU TO THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. TODAY I'M HERE AS A MOTHER AND A SURVIVOR OF GUN VIOLENCE IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN I LOST MY YOUNGEST SON AND HIS BEST FRIEND TO GUN VIOLENCE JUST BLOCKS AWAY FROM MY HOME IN WEST OAKLAND. THEY WERE NINETEEN YEARS- A FEW YEARS LATER IN TWENTY TWENTY ON MY BIRTHDAY ANOTHER ONE OF MY SONS WAS SHOT. HE SURVIVED BUT I WORRY OFTEN ABOUT HIS DAYS EVEN AS HE LAY IN THE HOSPITAL RIGHT NOW. I KNOW WHAT GUN VIOLENCE DOES TO FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES I LIVED THIS DISASTER EFFORT. THAT IS DISASTER ANY EFFORT EVERY DAY. THERE ARE MANY THINGS WE CAN DO TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE ONE OF THEM IS TO PASS LEGISLATION LIKE THIS S. B. THIRTEEN EIGHTY FOUR. THERE ARE DEALERS WHO PROFIT FROM THE GUN IN OUR COMMUNITY LIKE MINE THERE ARE STEPS THAT THEY CAN TAKE TO PREVENT THEM FROM BEING TRAFFICKED. THEY CAN PREVENT DANGEROUS FIREARMS SALES BUT RIGHT NOW THERE ARE NO FEDERAL LAWS OR REGULATIONS THAT REQUIRE DEALERS TO OFFER BASIC TRAINING SECURITY. ARE OFTEN SAFETY MEASURES AND WHILE IN CALIFORNIA HAS TAKEN SOME ACTIVE. BUT IT IS NOT ENOUGH AS A RESULT FAMILIES LIKE MINE BLACK AND BROWN FAMILIES. ACROSS OAKLAND ARE LEFT TO PICK UP THE PIECES WHERE THEIR LOVED ONES ARE VIOLENTLY TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM. WE CAN KEEP OTHERS FROM EXPERIENCE AND WHAT I HAVE EXPERIENCED. S. B. THIRTEEN EIGHTY FOUR THERE'S THE LIFE SAVING LEGISLATION THAT WOULD THREATEN TO GRANDE LIST ANDERS OVERSIGHT IN SECURITY IT WOULD HELP PREVENT GUN TRAFFICKING.

A WITNESS IN OPPOSITION WE HAVE NICK CRIVELLA IS DEEP AND PERSONAL REASON FOR MARK. SHOW ME IS ON THE PHONE MY MODERATOR. YOUR LINE IS OPEN I AM ON THE PHONE ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. YOU MAY BEGIN TO HEAL UP EMMA BRADFORD AND- THANK YOU GERMAN BRADFORD ENGLISH WITH THIS FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. MY NAME'S NICK MILLER WITH THE CALIFORNIA RIFLE AND PISTOL ASSOCIATION AND WE RESPECTFULLY STAND IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO SENATE BILL THIRTEEN EIGHTY FOUR. THAT'S WRITTEN THIS BILL WOULD BE IMMERSED IN ON THAT I'M A- ON THE LIGHTS ARE ON THE THIRST TO SET UP EQUIPMENT MONITORING RECORD THE TRANSACTIONS. OF FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION IN ADDITION SURPLUS OF SHIPS WILL BE TRAINED NUMBER ONE TO PROFILE POTENTIAL GUN TRAFFICKER OR STRAW PURCHASE. NUMBER TWO HOW TO ASSURE ENTERTAIN WHETHER PROSPECT OF. FARM PURCHASE SERVICE LAWFULLY PURCHASING A FIREARM BY ASKING QUESTIONS OF THAT PERSON AND THREE HUNDRED REPORT A SUSPECTED FRAUDULENT PURCHASE TO THE D. O. J. OR TO THE A. T. L. FOR OF ALL BACKGROUND CHECKS. ALL REQUIRED THAT SEEK OUT LEGAL POTENTIAL PURCHASERS OF FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION. EXISTING SOMEONE'S DO NOT PASS BACKGROUND CHECKS AND THEY'RE NOT BUYING GUNS GUNS FROM ESSENTIALS. AND LASTLY HOW DO YOU LEGALLY PROFILE A POSSIBLE FRAUDULENT PURCHASER WITHOUT VIOLATING OUR- CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS BACKGROUND CHECK IS ALREADY VERY SENSITIVE AND THOROUGH IN MY OWN EXPERIENCEI'VE EXPERIENCED JUST THE MERE ADDRESS CHANGE AND I WAS DENIED THE PURCHASE OF SOME SHOTGUN SHELLS FOR THIS LAST TWENTY SEASONS. SO WE FAIL TO SEE HOW THESE RIGHT REQUIREMENTS AND SERVICE REQUEST DELETED ONE OF PROPER USE OF FIREARMS. THE BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THAT GUN OWNERS ARE EDUCATED ABOUT THE DANGERS OF FIREARM USAGE. IT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE DOJ TO OFFERS TRAINING COURSES AT THE ELEMENT ON DUCT. THEM YOU KNOW YOU CAN ARM FRACTURES. THIS COURSE WOULD HAVE NUMEROUS QUESTIONS AND REQUIRE A TESTING OR- BUT- THIS WOULD BE DONE. THAT'S THE CELLS ALREADY NOTIFICATION DANGERS OF FIREARM USAGE SUPPORT LAWFUL AND SAFE FIREARM USE ADDITIONALLY THE POTENTIAL PURCHASER IS CURRENTLY REQUIRED TO HAVE PASSED AND RECEIVED A GUN SAFETY CERTIFICATE ON OUR SAFETY EDUCATION CERTIFICATE OR EQUIVALENT SUCH AS A PCA THIRTY TWO WHICH IS A FIREARMS AND ARREST FOR VACATION OR SIMPLY BE CERTIFIED PEACE SIR. IN FACT A PURCHASER LET'S GET ALL THE QUESTIONS CORRECT NOT JUST 70% AS WOULD REACH THE REQUIRED OF THE SSL SELECTIONS EVER FELDER FULLY AWARE OF THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS OF SALES AND TRANSFERS OF ARMS AND AMMUNITION. THAT IS WHY THEY AREN'T AT THE FILM THAT'S A FEDERAL FIREARMS LICENSE THIS IS THE REAL STUFF ANY VIOLATION OR MIS STEP IN THE PROCESS AND IT FELT GOOD IN DANGER OF LOSING THEIR LICENSE AND THEIR LIVELIHOOD AGAIN THE REGULATIONS ALREADY PLACE. HE WAS TO SAY THE REQUIREMENTS TO OBTAIN AN SSL FROM THE ATF ONE OF THE MOST STRINGENT LICENSES WANT TO POSSIBLY ACQUIRE THE BILL IS-REFUNDED IN THIS REGARD AND AS SUCH IS NOT THE- LAW AND REQUIREMENTS ARE CURRENTLY USE AND EVEN BEYOND THE REQUIRED SSL. GET A FIREARMS DEALER LICENSE IN CALIFORNIA THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER SECURITY. INSECURITY CARNAGE IN PLACE. NOW AND WOULD BE RETURNED IT IN THAT SPEECH. FOUR FINALLY- PRIMARY CONCERN IS THAT THE IS A HAPPY OPPOSITE OF THAT INTO THAT IT. AND WE'LL MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES MORE UNSAFE BY BURNING ARE ALREADY UNDER STAFFED AND OVER COMMITTED DOJ AND THE SENTENCE WAS UNNECESSARY AND CUMBERSOME REQUIREMENTS. WITH OVER TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND I'M GONNA ASK YOU TO CONCLUDE YOUR TESTIMONY PLEASE GIVE. DON'T. YES SIR IN OTHER WORDS LET'S FOCUS ON THE CRIMINAL AND NOT THE LOT LIGHTING SYSTEM IN THE INFRINGEMENT OF OUR SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THIS- ABILITY TO SPEAK.

AFTER HEARING FROM BOTH SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION WILL NOT BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE OTHER ANY QUESTIONS SENATOR WENT ON I THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN I DON'T ANY QUESTIONS FOR SOMEONE TO MOVE THE BILL AND THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD YOU KNOW I HAVE TO SAY- PEOPLE WHO ARE- ADVOCATE FOR GUNS AND WHO. HAVE HELPED ME COMPLETELY THE STORE ON THE SECOND AMENDMENT AND INDUCE THE SUPREME COURT TO LITERALLY. A REWRITE OF THE US CONSTITUTION AND TO IGNORE THE PLAIN LANGUAGE. OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT- THESE HYPOCRITES ON THE SUPREME COURT JUST TO BE HONEST IT SAYS IS A LAWYER WITH A LOT OF RESPECT FOR THE JUDICIARY BUT EXTREMELY HYPOCRITICAL. TO CLAIM THAT YOU'RE AN ORIGINALIST BUT THEN YOU TAKE THE PLAIN LANGUAGE OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT WHICH WAS ABOUT A QUOTE WELL REGULATED MILITIA AND THEN SAY MEANS ANYONE AN OWN ANY GUN AND IN CITIES AND STATES CAN PROTECT THEIR COMMUNITIES FROM GUN VIOLENCE IT'S REALLY JUST- IT'S SO DESTRUCTIVE TO OUR SOCIETY AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED. JUST DOWN THE STREET FROM HERE JUST A COUPLE BLOCKS FROM THE CAPITOL A FEW WEEKS AGO WITHOUT MASS SHOOTING THERE WAS A NOTETHERE AND IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY DAY NOW WE BECOME NUMB TO IT. TO MATCH. AND WE KNOW THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE SHOOTINGS NEVER MAKE THE NEWS. IT'S PEOPLE COULD HAVE A GUN IN THEIR HOME OR SOMEONE SHOOT SO IT'S JUST- AND IT'S JUST. SO DESTRUCTIVE INVITED OUR KIDS CAN'T EVEN. GO TO SCHOOL. WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT WHETHER THERE'S GOING TO BE A SHOOTING IN THEIR SCHOOL IMAGINE THAT. KID GOES TO SCHOOL SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT LEARNING AND DEVELOPING. SOCIAL SKILLS AND BEING WITH THEIR FRIENDS AND INSTEAD THEY'RE HAVING TO LIKE LEARN HOW TO WHAT TO DO IF SOMEONE WALKS INTO YOUR SCHOOL. WITH A GUN AND THAT'S THE STATE OF AFFAIRS. THAT WERE IN AND THIS BILL IS JUST ASKING THAT THESE GUN DEALERS BE RESPONSIBLE. SO THAT WE KNOW WHO'S GOING IN AND BUYING GUNS. SO THEY HAVE. THE RIGHT TRAINING AND SECURITY REQUIREMENTS. M. AND EVEN THAT'S- A THEY EVEN OBJECT TO THAT. WAS AT THE WILDWOOD THEY THEY'VE INJECTED. WHEN CENTERPOINT TINO. HOW TO BUILD SAY THAT YOU CAN ONLY BUY ONE GUN PER MONTH. TWELVE GUNS HERE IT'S A LOT OF GUNS TWELVE GUNS PER YEAR YOU'RE ALL AT DOT- THAT'S UNREASONABLE TO SAY I CAN ONLY BUY ONE GUN PER MONTH OR TWELVE GUNS A YEAR. AND NOW ADDRESSING THE TRAINING AND EVERYTHING- I'M SORRY BUT IT THIS THIS ATTACK ON ANY EFFORT. NO MATTER HOW MODEST TO PROTECT THEIR COMMUNITY FROM GUN VIOLENCE AND DEATH. IS IT REALLY JUST DOES NOT SIT WELL WITH ME AND I KNOW THAT THE OPPONENTS ARE GOING TO BE LIKE WELL JUST TAKE EVERYTHING THE SUPREME COURT BECAUSE ALSO SAY EVERYTHING IS COVERED. BY THIS DISTORTED READING THE SECOND AMENDMENT BUT WE NEED TO DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND SO I SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSIONS IN OUR COMMON. WELL I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL AND I WOULD ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE BY THEM MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO A READING THROUGH THIS BILL IN THE ANALYSIS YOU KNOW AS FAR AS I CAN TELL AND CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG THIS BILL WOULD JUST REQUIRE DEALERS TO HAVE MORE TRAINING TO PROVIDE FOR SURVEILLANCE. AND THEIR PLACES OF BUSINESS AND TO ENGAGE AS A BETTER PARTNER WITH THE DOJ. THIS BILL IS NOT TAKING AWAY SOMEONE'S GUNS- END. IT'S SUGGESTING THAT YOU CAN HAVE PERSONAL FREEDOM WHICH IS WHAT THE SECOND AMENDMENT IS ABOUT BUT IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU ARE- NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COLLECTIVE SECURITY AND SAFETY OF YOUR FELLOW NEIGHBORS FRIENDS AND CONSTITUENTS. AND SO WHAT WE HAVE TO KIND OF MOVE BEYOND- THE SELFISHNESS. OF GUN OWNERSHIP AND FIGURE OUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO PROTECT PEOPLE- GUNS KILL PEOPLE BECAUSE PEOPLE KILL PEOPLE AND WE HAVE GOT TO BE HONEST ABOUT THAT. SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS QUESTIONS BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YOU OKAY WELL I WANNA THANK YOU CENTERMAN FOR THIS MEASURE I THINK IT'S STRAIGHT FORWARD I THINK IT'S VERY CLEAR AND I WON'T REPEAT THAT WHICH HAS BEEN ALREADY STATED ON THE REASONS AND THE BENEFITS FOR THIS MEASURE SO OUR ALLOW YOU TO CLOSE AT THIS TIME- JUST TO REITERATE THIS IS A REAL PROBLEM THAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO DRESS IN THAT WE HAVE- BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN ALMOST TWO THOUSAND GUNS WERE STOLEN FROM FEDERALLY LICENSED GUN DEALERS HERE IN CITY CALIFORNIA OCT THIRTY THIRTY THOUSAND STROSSEN GIRLS WERE TEMPTED OVER THAT SAME PERIOD- THAT IS WHEN YOU TRY TO FIGHT ON BEHALF OF SOMEONE ELSE GIVE THE GUY A WEEKLY TO THAT PERSON. ACCORDING TO DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THIS IS A REAL PROBLEM WE THINK THESE ARE REASONABLE MEASURES AND- JUST TO ECHO THE COLLEAGUES AND MY COLLEAGUE A COMMENT TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO THIS IS THE COST OF GUN VIOLENCE IN THE STATE IN OUR COMMUNITIES IS ASTRONOMICAL IT'S NOT JUST THE ECONOMIC COSTS IT'S THE EMOTIONAL AND SOCIAL COSTS EVERYBODY THAT DIES OR IS VICTIMIZED BY GUN VIOLENCE IS AN IMPORTANT MEMBER OF THEIR FAMILY OF THEIR COMMUNITY. MORE EFFORT TO TRY TO LIMIT- SOME ASPECTS OF THAT- BUT I THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS.

FOURTEEN EIGHTEEN WHICH WILL CODIFY ON GOING FUNDING IS GOOD IF THE SUCCESSFUL NORTH ORANGE COUNTY PUBLIC SAFETY COLLABORATIVE LOCATED IN MY DISTRICT WHILE ALSO FUNDING AND REPLICATING A SECOND ANALOGOUS COLLABORATIVE MODEL IN THE CENTRAL COAST REGION LEFT TO THEIR OWN PLANS AND RESOURCES CITIES IN CALIFORNIA BUT TOOK THE SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED CITIES HAVE HAD AT BEST LIMITED SUCCESS IN ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS YOUTH VIOLENCE IN THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH POST INCARCERATION. REENTRY ON THE ONE HAND THESE ENDEMIC PROBLEMS TEND TO DEFINE MUNICIPAL BOUNDARIES WELL ON THE OTHER THE OTHER INHERENTLY LOCAL NATURE TENDS TO DEFEAT TOP DOWN SOLUTIONS DEVISED AND IMPLEMENTED AT THE STATE OR EVEN COUNTY LEVELS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THROUGH A DEDICATED BUDGET ALLOCATION I PARTNER WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY LEADERS IN MY DISTRICT TO FUND AND DEVELOP A COLLABORATIVE MODEL THAT COORDINATES AND ONCE THE EFFORTS OF TEN LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY LISTING AND SUPPORTING MORE THAN FORTY LOCAL COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WITH EXPERIENCE. AND EXPERTISE IN ADDRESSING THE UNDERLYING CAUSES OF THESE COMPLEX CHALLENGES NOW IN ITS FIFTH YEAR OF OPERATION THE NORTH ORANGE COUNTY PUBLIC SAFETY COLLABORATIVE C. D. LIBERALLY COLLABORATIVE APPROACH TO DEVISING REFINING AND EXPANDING PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS AND PREVENT YOU FILINGS TO PROMOTE SUCCESSFUL POST INCARCERATION REENTRY STRATEGIES AND DEVELOP BETTER MORE EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES PLANS FOR ADDRESSING AND SOLVING HOMELESSNESS ON A REGIONAL SCALE. UNDER ITS DESIGN THE NORTH ORANGE COUNTY PUBLIC SAFETY COLLABORATIVE MODEL ALLOCATES 40% OF FUNDING TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ENHANCE IMPROVE THEIR HOME IS A COMMUNITY LIAISON EFFORTS WHILE THE REMAINING 60% OF FUNDING IS DISTRIBUTED CROSS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ON AN R. F. P. GRANT BASIS TO SUPPORT SPECIFIC PROGRAMS THAT ARE DEEMED EFFECTIVE WERE PROMISING IN ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF A GIVEN POPULATION BY VIRTUE OF THIS DELIVERY MULTI DIMENSIONAL APPROACH THE COLLABORATIVE BECOME A LABORATORY FOR INNOVATIVE AND TARGETED ACTION THROUGHOUT THE ELEVEN MEMBER CITIES. AS A DIRECT RESULT OF THE SUCCESS AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ACROSS MEMBER CITIES ARE. NO LONGER WORKING IN SILOS AND INSTEAD WORK HE COORDINATION QANTAS. PROMISING RESULTS AMONG THOSE MEASURABLE RESULTS THE COLLABORATIVE HELP MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE EXIT THE STREETS. AND SECURE HOUSING IN THE NORTH ORANGE COUNTY REGION IT HAS FUNDED THIRTY THREE TARGETED YOUTH PROGRAMS AND WILL SOON SERVE AS THE FOUNDATION FOR A REGIONAL HUB FOR COORDINATING HOMELESS SERVICES. THROUGH ITS WORK THE COLLABORATIVE'S ALSO DEVELOPED A MOBILE PLATFORM AND SMARTPHONE APPLICATIONS. FOR COLLECTING AND SHARING INFORMATION ON ON HOUSED INDIVIDUALS MAKING REFERRALS TRACKING PROGRESS AND EVEN INSTANTLY BOOKING BEDS IN LOCAL SHELTERS THIS PLATFORM CALLED OUTREACH GRID. HAS PROVEN SO VALUABLE THAT IT IS NOW TRIALS WITH OTHER CITIES AND WITH LA METRO. A PARTICULAR PRIDE THE PROGRAM'S MEMBER AGENCIES EVEN AS OUT REACH INTERVENTIONS AND REFERRALS HAVE INCREASED. NO HOMELESS INDIVIDUAL INTERACTING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS BEEN ARRESTED OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS UNDER THE FUNDING STRUCTURE PROVIDED FOR UNDER SB FOURTEEN EIGHTEEN EACH COLLABORATIVE. NORTH AND SOUTH WILL BE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN AN ADVISORY BOARD TO MANAGE APPROPRIATED FUNDS AND REPORT TO THE BOARD OF STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS PROGRAM AT LEAST ONCE PER CYCLE. AS MANDATED UNDER THE ORIGINAL PROGRAM THE SPECIAL WOULD GROW BOTH COLLABORATES TO DISTRIBUTE AT LEAST 60% OF THEIR FUNDING TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WITH THE REMAINING 40% AVAILABLE TO AUGMENT LAW ENFORCEMENT HOMELESS OUTREACH. AT THE MINUTE MUNICIPAL OR REGIONAL LEVEL. RESOLVING HOMELESSNESS YOUTH VIOLENCE IN POST INCARCERATION REENTRY CHALLENGES ARE OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE IN THE NORTH ORANGE COUNTY REGION. AND IN FACT STATE WIDE THE NORTH ORANGE COUNTY PUBLIC SAFETY COLLABORATIVE HAS PROVEN ITSELF AN INNOVATIVE MODEL FOR IMPROVING PUBLIC SAFETY. AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL THAT CAN AND SHOULD BE REPLICATED SIMILAR JURISDICTIONS ACROSS THE STATE- I HAVE AS MY JOINT AUTHORS SENATOR LAYERED AND I RESPECTFULLY ASKING FOR YOUR- VOTE TO DATE. WITH ME TO TESTIFY HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM IS SOO ELIZABETH CARRYING THE EXPECTED DIRECTOR OF THE. NORTH ORANGE COUNTY PUBLIC SAFETY COLLABORATIVE. THANK YOU SENATOR. NEWMAN AND HIS GANG WHEN YOU'RE READY YOU MAY BEGIN YOUR TESTIMONY YOU. YOU'RE THE ONLY PRIMARY WITNESS SO YA FORMAN. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS C. K. ASSISTANT TO THE CITY MANAGER AND THE CITY STANTON AND ON SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE NORTH ORANGE COUNTY PUBLIC SAFETY COLLECTIVE. THE CITY OF STAUNTON IS THE FISCAL AGENT TO THIS COLLABORATIVE PRIOR I WAS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF ORANGE COUNTY HALFWAY HOUSE YOUTH AND FAMILY SERVICES. A NONPROFIT FOUNDED BY FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS TO PROVIDE SUCCESSFUL REINTEGRATION. THIS MORNING I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU ABOUT THE COLLABORATIVE IN THE LAST FOUR AND A HALF YEARS AND WHY IT MATTERS. SO WHAT DID THE NORTH ORANGE COUNTY REGION LOOK LIKE BEFORE THE COLLABORATIVE FUNDING. OUR REGION HAD A HISTORY OF COLLABORATIVE APPROACHES TO ADDRESSING VARIOUS PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUES HOWEVER THE EXISTING WORKING GROUPS IN THE REGIONS WERE BOTH LIMITED IN FUNDS AND RESOURCES CAUSING COUNTERPRODUCTIVE COMPETITION FOR THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. OFTEN THOSE EFFORTS IN THE REGIONS WERE UNNECESSARY DUPLICATIVE AND HAD GAPS IN SERVICES. COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES WERE OPERATING IN ISOLATION WITH NO UNDERSTANDING THAT PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS AND THE SAME REGION WE'RE OFFERING THE SAME SERVICES TO SAME POPULATION. THE RESULT OF A LACK OF COMMUNICATION COORDINATION AND A LOT OF WASTED TIME EFFORT AND RESOURCE. SO WHAT DID THE NORTH ORANGE COUNTY REGION LOOK LIKE DURING THE COLLABORATIVE FUNDING. WELL IT IS STYLISH OF FOUNDATIONAL ACTIVITY. ACCOUNTABILITY WITH MEASURABLE RESULTS. FOR THE FIRST TIME A NEW INCENTIVE TO COLLABORATE WENT BEYOND DESPERATION BUT TO INTO INNOVATION DATA AND STRATEGY BROUGHT TOGETHER ORGANIZATIONS TO SHARE ASSETS AND PRODUCE NEW VALUE AND MODEL. UNIFIED RESPONSIBILITY AND A REGIONAL LEADERSHIP AND FOR THE FIRST TIME PUBLIC SAFETY WORKERS WERE BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION WORKERS TO COLLABORATE AND COORDINATE STREET OUT REACH REGIONALLY. MANY OF THESE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS HAD NO IDEA THAT THE OTHER EXISTED AND PREVIOUSLY HAD NO OPPORTUNITY TO PARTNER WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. IN ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS A BY NAME CENSUS MANAGEMENT DATA WAS FUNDED AND TO DATE OVER FOURTEEN HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN STABILIZED AND HOUSE FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE MORE ENGAGE IN CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES AND THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED WITH ZERO ARRESTS. THE COLLABORATIVE ALSO INVESTED IN OUTREACH GRID THE MOBILE APP BASED SINGLE COMMUNICATION PLATFORM TO OFFERED THE RIGHT RESOURCE TO THE RIGHT PERSON AT THE RIGHT TIME ELIMINATING SERVICE REDUNDANCIES OR LOSS OF CONTACT WITH CLIENTS ON THE STREET. WE ALSO FOUNDED THE NATION'S FIRST HOUSING AND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES FOR FORMERLY INCARCERATED UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AT CAL STATE FULLERTON'S PROJECT REBOUND. THE COLLABORATIVE ALSO DEVELOPED A TRAINING INTENDED TO BUILD THE CAPACITY OF OUR FORTY FIVE VENDOR PARTNERS TO BE BETTER TO REALIZE THIS NEW VISION OF REGIONAL LEADERSHIP AMONG PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THROUGH THESE TRAININGS 94% NOTED AN OVERALL EFFICACY SINCE PARTICIPATING WHILE 46% MAKE CHANGES AND HOW THEY COLLABORATE AS 73% HAD ALREADY IMPLEMENTED THE TRAINING STRATEGIES. THERE HAS BEEN NO USE OF FORCE ONLY OUR REACH EMPATHY IN ACTION THAT HAS RESULTED IN DATA DRIVEN PRACTICES ALL INDEPENDENTLY REVIEWED BY KELSI FULTON SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH CENTER. THE COLLABORATIVE MODEL MATTERS BECAUSE IT IS A GROUND BREAKING MULTI DISCIPLINARY PARTNERSHIPS THAT CAUSES. THAT CREATES LEVEL COMMUNITIES FOR ALL PRODUCING BENEFITS BEYOND SOCIAL OUTCOMES WE ARE CONFIDENT IT OFFERS REAL PROMISE AND THE BASIS FOR LOCAL EXPANSION AS WELL AS REPLICATION ACROSS THE STATE. WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT A SENATE BILL FOURTEEN EIGHTEEN TO PROVIDE THE RESOURCES AND STRUCTURES TO CONTINUE TO EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGING COMMUNITY ISSUES. THANK YOU.

OKAY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR S. B. ELEVEN SEVENTY EIGHT. WILL ELIMINATE THE TIME LIMITATION ON RETROSPECTIVE CASES IN WHICH PERSONS CONVICTED OF A QUALIFYING FELONY MAY FILE A PETITION TO THE COURT TO HAVE THEIR SENTENCE REDUCED A RECORD THREE CLASSIFIED AS A MISDEMEANOR. IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN PROP FORTY SEVEN RECLASSIFIED SIX LOW LEVEL NONVIOLENT FELONIES AS MISDEMEANORS AND AUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS CONVICTED OF QUALIFYING FELONIES TO PETITION THE COURT TO RE SENTENCE THEIR PREVIOUS CONVICTIONS AS MISDEMEANORS. PROP FORTY SEVEN ESTABLISHED INTERNATIONAL A INITIAL THREE YEAR ONE GOAL THROUGH NOVEMBER FOR TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN DURING WHICH- JEWEL INDIVIDUALS COULD PETIION THE COURT FOR RECORDS. CHANGES AFTER THE DEADLINE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR RECORDS REQUESTS VACATION IS AVAILABLE WITH A SHOWING OF GOOD CAUSE RECOGNIZING THE MASSIVE NUMBERS OF INDIVIDUALS ELIGIBLE FOR RECORDS RELIEF. THE LEGISLATURE PASSED AND GOVERNOR BROWN SIGNED AB TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY FIVE IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN WHICH EXTENDED THE DEADLINE TO NOVEMBER FOURTH TWENTY TWENTY TWO OR LATER UPON SHOWING OF GOOD CAUSE THIS BILL SEEKS TO ELIMINATE THE DEADLINE FOR SEVERAL REASONS. INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE INDIGENT AND ON HOUSE ARE OFTEN PREOCCUPIED WITH ATTENDING TO BASIC SURVIVAL NEEDS EVEN IF THEY'RE AWARE OF THE VEIL RECENT SINCE REAL RELIEF. THEY ARE LIKELY UNAWARE OF THE REQUIREMENTS TO PREPARE AND FILE THE PETITIONS OR THAT THEIR WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY WILL END. FURTHERED THIS VULNERABLE POPULATION OFTEN LACKS THE TECHNOLOGY TO CONNECT THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE AND THE COURTS TO BEGIN THIS PROCESS AND FINALLY OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS THE PANDEMIC HAS LIMITED ACCESS TO THE COURTS AND CREATED A SIGNIFICANT BACKLOG. S. THREE ELEVEN SEVENTY EIGHT WOULD PROVIDE A PERMANENT AND LESS RESOURCE INTENSIVE MECHANISM FOR OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS TO SEEK RECORDS REDRESS AUTHORIZED UNDER PROP FORTY SEVEN. THIS IS NOT IN ANY WAY EXPAND THE UNIVERSE OF INDIVIDUALS WHO QUALIFY FOR RE SENTENCING OR RE CLASSIFICATION OR EXPAND THE LIST. OF QUALIFYING OFFENSES THIS BILL IS CO SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA SAFETY AND JUSTICE AND THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TESTIFYING TODAY. R.

AS YOU MAY KNOW NATIVE AMERICANS WE HAVE THAT ARE CAPITALIZED EFFECT RETIRED CORPORATION RATE. THE HIGHEST OF CLEAN ALLERGY. I'M SURE THIS POINT YOU COULD AT ELEVEN TEN EIGHT. ELIMINATE THE CURRENT MEMBER FOR TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO DEADLINE FOR FILING. THE COURT. RECORDS A CLASSIFICATION. OR RESENTENCING FOR OTHERWISE QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS ADDED PROVISIONS OF PROP FORTY SEVEN. WELL THE REASON WHY I'M SO PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS IS BECAUSE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN MY FELONIES FOR DRUG POSSESSION IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A MISDEMEANOR THE WATER WHICH WE CLASSIFIED AS A CURRENT COUNTY PUBLIC DEFENDER'S PROP FORTY SEVEN UNIT. SO YOU KNOW I WAS TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT AND I BELIEVE THAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN TREATED FOR MY ADDICTION. NOT PUNISHED FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE AS WE KNOW THE EXTENT. OF DAMAGE PEOPLE'S RECORDS FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES AS WE ARE TRYING TO GET HOUSING EMPLOYMENT AND OTHER. AFTER COMPLETING ONLY PROBATION AND- TWENTY TWENTY TWO ADULTS AND A DRUG PROGRAM. I WILL JUST KIND OF WHAT WE'RE CALIFORNIA TO GO BACK TO COLLEGE AT. THE COLLEGE. MY FIRST SEMESTER AT A FOUR POINT NO. I'M GETTING A STUDENT JOB CAMPBELL AT THE G. O. P. S. YOUR ADVISOR I WAS INFORMED BY THE HR DEPARTMENT AT THE FELONY ON MY RECORD WOULD BE TO COME OFF EVERYONE KNEW BETTER JOB AT THE COLLEGE. YOU CAN IMAGINE THE STRESS THAT WAS ADDED TO MY LIFE AFTER THIS. IT WAS IN ON IT. BUT I WOULD BELIEVE THAT I WORKED HARD AND HAD HOPED HE WOULD CHANGE THINGS BUT IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AFTER COMPLETING A BACHELOR'S AND MASTER'S AT CAL STATE BAKERSFIELD. I WAS ABLE TO- RUN OUR PROPERTIES HAVING CAMPAIGNING KERN COUNTY. AFTER BECOMING A COMMUNITY ORGANIZER WITH FAITH IN THE VALLEY. EIGHT AND ACTING CURRENT COUNTY PACIFICO NETWORK. AND WINNING IN NOVEMBER TWENTY FOURTEEN WITH OVERWHELMINGLY REPUBLICAN. AND DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT THE. 201460% PASSAGE RATE. THANK YOU HAVE TO FIGHT FOR LIVER. AND THAT IS WHAT THOUSANDS OF ASSOCIATE MANY OF US WERE RELEASED MANY WERE RELEASED FROM PRISON THAT VERY NIGHT NOVEMBER TWENTY FOURTEEN EVEN GETTING UP ALL. THEY GOT UP AT THE COUNTY OF THEIR RESIDENCE. BY FORTY SEVEN WITH THE GAME CHANGER WE ALWAYS HEAR THE NEGATIVE THAT IT'S FUN THAT SPECIALLY TODAY THE BILLS THAT ARE COMING UP. BUT IT WAS A GAME CHANGER FOR MANY OF US AS I NO LONGER HAVE TO CHECK A BOX. THAT I WAS THE BALANCE. SO MY DAUGHTER CAN LIVE WITH ME WHICH WAS FOURTEEN. IN HIGH SCHOOL I COULD PROVIDE A PLACE FOR ELEVEN A LONGER TO CHECK A BOX. TO RESTORE MY DIGNITY. FOR MYSELF AND THOUSANDS OF OTHERS. ANOTHER THING THAT WILL HAPPEN YOU'LL BUY IT THE BODY ACCORDING TO PROVIDE MORE TIME FOR PEOPLE. TO CHANGE THEIR RECORDS. MANY OF THE INTENDED BENEFICIARIES THE PROPERTY SEVEN INCLUDING THOSE WHO SUFFER FROM MENTAL ILLNESS. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER MAY BE RELUCTANT TO SPEAK RECORD. REALLY BECAUSE OF THEIR OWN NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. NATIONALLY THERE ARE MORE THAN FORTY THOUSAND RESTRICTIONS PLACED ON PEOPLE LIVING THE COLE COUNTY CONVICTIONS INCLUDING NEARLY FIVE THOUSAND CALIFORNIA. FOR ALL THESE REASONS I HUMBLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT. OF SB ELEVEN SEVENTY EIGHT. AND GIVE INDIVIDUALS MORE TIME TO SEEK TRANSFER DIRECTLY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SHOWING FOR YOUR TESTIMONY THIS MORNING WE HAVE A SECOND LEAD- SUPPORT WITNESS RICARDO ARE YOU ON THE LINE. I AM ON THE LINE THANK YOU PLEASE PROCEED SIMILARLY MISTER KERR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS RICARDO GARCIA AND I AM. A PUBLIC DEFENDER FOR LOS ANGELES COUNTY WHICH IS THE LARGEST AND OLDEST PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE THE CALIFORNIA. WHAT DOES COUNTY PROUD BECAUSE FONTERRA SB ELEVEN SEVENTY EIGHT ALONG WITH THE CALIFORNIANS FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE. WILL ELIMINATE IF PASSED THE SUNSET DATE HOW TO FILE PETITIONS UNDER PROP FORTY SEVEN WHICH IS A KEY ISSUE IN TODAY'S CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM. AT ELEVEN SEVENTY SIX NARROWLY DRAFTED BILL THAT SEEKS TO STANDARD IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY TO ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS ENSURES ACCESS TO A PERMANENT AND MORE EFFICIENT PROCESS FOR RECORDS CORRECTIONS. AS YOU'RE AWARE PROP FORTY SEVEN WAS PASSED BY THE VOTERS IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND CHANGE THE PENALTY FOR SIMPLE DRUG POSSESSION AND SEVERAL PETTY THEFT CRIMES FROM FELONIES TO MISDEMEANORS. THIS FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE AND IMPROVE THE LIVES OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS AND PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN MINUTES GAME CHANGER ULTIMATELY A LIFELINE TO VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS. THIS SUPPORT HAS PROVED CRITICAL AS CALIFORNIA IS NOW FACING I'M PRESENT AND PRESIDENT SET OF CHALLENGES. IN THE SEVEN YEARS SINCE THE PASSAGE OF PROP FORTY SEVEN. FOOT HAS SUCCESSFULLY REDUCE CALIFORNIA'S RELIANCE ON HARMFUL AND COSTLY INCARCERATION TODAY FEWER CALIFORNIANS CYCLE TO THE JAILS AND PRISONS FOR LOW LEVEL OFFENSES. THIS SAVES FAMILIES ALLOW FOR COMMITTEES TO REBUILD AND SAVE US HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT COULD BE SPENT. ON SUPPORTING THE FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. FORTY SEVEN IN. THE RIGHT TO PETITION THE COURT FOR RESENTENCING OUR RECORDS AND RE CLASSIFICATION. NOW THE ORIGINAL DEADLINE FOR FILING THE PETITIONS WAS NOVEMBER FOURTH TWENTY SEVENTEEN. BUT IT QUICKLY BECAME CLEAR THAT THREE YEARS WITH NOT ENOUGH AND THAT TO DO THAT. WHAT DID SHE NEEDED TO DO WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE TIME AND THAT IS WHY IN TWENTY SIXTEEN A NEW BILL TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY FIVE AN ACT EXTENDING THE DEADLINE. TO NOVEMBER TWENTY SECOND. NOW I'M HERE TO ASK YOU THAT WE ALLOW THAT DEADLINE TO NOT PAST WEEK STAND IT INDEFINITELY LET ME TELL YOU WHY. FIRST NOT EVERY ELIGIBLE PERSON I'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK RELIEF. ADDITIONALLY KOPIN RELATED DELAYS ALONE HAVE HINDERED OUR COURTS ABILITY AS CASES THE LAST TWO YEARS AND FINALLY IF THE SUNSET PROVISIONS WERE TO STAND QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS COULD STILL SEEK RELIEF BUT ONLY FOR A MORE TIME. AND RESOURCE INTENSIVE SHOWING OF GOOD CAUSE. THIS WOULD HAVE A PARTICULARLY DISPROPORTIONATE ADVERSE IMPACT ON LOWERING CAP INCOME COMMUNITIES AND BLACK AND BROWN CALIFORNIA. PROP FORTY SEVEN HAS SINCE ITS PASSAGE LESSONS RACIAL DISPARITIES IN THE CALIFORNIA CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM. REDUCE UNCONSTITUTIONAL OVERCROWDING IN STATE PRISONS. WE INVESTED MORE THAN A BILLION HALF A BILLION DOLLARS INTO LOCAL PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSES OF INCARCERATION FOR MORE THAN FORTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS IT IS HELP REDUCE HOMELESSNESS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY IN THE CONTEXT OF ELEVEN SEVENTY EIGHT CREATED A PROCESS FOR CLASSIFYING OLD FELONIES. THAT REMOVES BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT HOUSING AND EXTRICATION AND PROVIDES PEOPLE WITH THE STABILITY THEY NEED TO PUT THEM ON ELVES ON THE ROAD TO SELF SUFFICIENCY. I URGE YOUR I VOTE ON ELEVEN SEVENTY EIGHT THANK YOU AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.

YOUR POPULAR THIS MORNING SENATOR CRAWFORD IT'S BEEN A SLOW NEWS DAY. WE WILL NOW CONTINUE WITH S. B. THIRTEEN EIGHTY NINE OKAY HAS THREE THIRTEEN EIGHTY NINE WOULD HAVE IT FOR HIM. THE PEACE OFFICER FROM INITIATING A MOTOR VEHICLE STOP FOR LOW LEVEL INFRACTIONS UNLESS THERE IS A SEPARATE INDEPENDENT. BASIS TO INITIATE THE STOP LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAFFIC STOPS ARE RACIALLY DISPROPORTIONATE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND REPORTS HAVE FOUND THAT BLACK CALIFORNIANS ARE MORE THAN TWICE AS LIKELY. TO BE SEARCHED AS A WHITE CALIFORNIA. OFTENTIMES THIS IS LED TO LAW ENFORCEMENT ACROSS THE STATE AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE MISUSE THEIR POWER DURING TRAFFIC STOPS TO FISH FOR INFORMATION OR SUSPECTED CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. WHICH PERPETUATES MISTRUST IN THE COMMUNITY AND LEADS TO UNNECESSARY AND NEGATIVE ENCOUNTERS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT SOME WILL CLAIM THAT SOME OF THE STOPS RESULTED IN THE APPREHENSION A WANTED FELON THESE FELONS I SHOULD SAY OR UNCOVERING ILLEGAL DRUGS OR WEAPONS THAT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN FOUND OTHERWISE. BUT IT'S ALSO RESULTED IN UNNECESSARY TRAGEDIES. WE ALL REMEMBER IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN IN TEXAS SANDRA BLAND A TWENTY EIGHT YEAR OLD WOMAN WHO WAS FOUND DEAD INSIDE OF HER. JAIL CELL THREE DAYS AFTER BEING PULLED OVER ON THIS SUSPICION OF THE USE OF A LEGAL- CHANGE LINE SIGNAL I SHOULD SAY IN CHANGING OUR LINES WE ALSO JUST RECENTLY DANTE WRIGHT. WHO WAS SHOT AND KILLED AFTER BEING PULLED OVER FOR SIMPLY HAVING AIR FRESHENER HANGING FROM HIS REAR VIEW MIRROR.

JUST LAST MONTH LAPD COMMISSION PRESIDENT WILLIAM BRICKS STATED. GOALS FOR. FREE TEXTURAL STOPS DO NOT RESULT IN GUNS BEING TAKEN OFF THE STREETS THOSE PROTECTIONS STOPS DID NOT RESULT IN CURTAILING MURDERS OCCURRED TELLING SHOOTINGS THERE. IT IS NO DATA THAT ANYONE CAN POINT TO THAT ESTABLISHES THAT PRETERNATURAL STOPS CURTAIL VIOLENT CRIME IN OUR CITY. WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT FOCUSES THEIR ENERGY ON PURSUING LOW LEVEL TRAFFIC VIOLATION IT REDUCES THEIR ABILITY TO FOCUS ON MORE CRITICAL NEEDS IN THE COMMUNITY. THIS BILL WOULD PREVENT LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM STOPPING VEHICLES FIRST LOW LEVEL DRIVING CODE INFRACTIONS SUCH AS- EXPIRED REGISTRATION BUT NO MORE THAN SIX MONTHS. FAILURE TO PROPERLY FASTENED A LICENSE TO YOUR CAR OR VEHICLE LA LIGHTING MAU FOUGHT. FUNCTION LIMITED TO- THIS- SIGNAL LIGHTS.

THE LOW LEVEL INFRACTIONS DESCRIBED AS BILL RELATED TO VEHICLE SAFETY RIGHT AND IF OCCASION AND IF THEY'RE IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO BE KEPT ON THE BOOKS. POLICE OFFICERS SHOULD NOT BE TOLD THEY MUST NOT ENFORCE THEM UNLESS THERE'S A SEPARATE VIOLATION. ADDITIONALLY THE EXCEPTION TO ALLOW STOP FOR AN EXPIRED REGISTRATION ONLY OF THE REGISTRATION IS MORE THAN SIX MONTHS EXPIRED. IS IN PRACTICE NOT VERY HELPFUL BECAUSE IT MAY NOT BE REALLY APPARENT OR EASY FOR PEACE OFFICER TO ASCERTAIN THAT LITTLE DETAIL WITH TWO VEHICLES IN MOTION. ALSO TRAFFIC STOPS FOR VIOLATIONS DESCRIBED AS BILL ROUTINELY RESULT IN ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS FOR MUCH MORE SERIOUS OFFENSES. IN MANY CASES UNDERTAKEN OFF THE STREET DRUGS ARE SEIZED AND OTHER CRIMES ARE UNCOVERED IN THE PROCESS OF A TRAFFIC STOP. FOR THESE REASONS WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL THANK YOU.

TO VIOLATE PEOPLE'S RIGHTS- AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT THE LAW OF AVERAGES SAYS THAT IF YOU STOP ENOUGH PEOPLE YOU WILL EVENTUALLY FIND WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BUT THAT IS NOT THE INTENT OF LAW. AND SO THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO STOP. THANK YOU SENATOR CUMAR PRATT FOR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES THANK YOU AND I THINK THIS IS A COMMON SENSE MEASURE NOT SIMPLY BECAUSE IT'S MY BILL BUT WE'VE SEEN HISTORY- AND IT'S PROVEN- THE DISH PORTION IT NUMBER OF TIMES THAT PEOPLE OF COLOR HAVE BEEN STOPPED THAT HAVE LED TO- I'M SORRY ABUSE DEATH AND UNNECESSARY INCARCERATION AND I STAND HERE AS A VICTIM. WHO HAVE BEEN STOPPED THREE TIMES AS A STATE LEGISLATURE TWICE BECAUSE THEY SAID I NEVER SAW A RED A ON A LICENSE PLATE BEFORE- THE SECOND TIME I WAS STOPPED BECAUSE- WE STOP YOU BECAUSE YOUR HEADLIGHT WASN'T WORKING ON YOUR CAR BUT THEN I WAS FORCED OUT OF MY CAR TO DO A SOBRIETY TEST THAT. I PASSED WITH FLYING COLORS AND THIS IS HOW DO I GO FROM HAVING A HEADLIGHT TO JOIN A SOBRIETY TEST WILL YOU LOOK SUSPICIOUS SO. ANYWAY SO THOSE THINGS CONTINUE TO HAPPEN AND IF THEY HAPPEN TO ME IMAGINE WHAT IT HAPPENS TO AGAIN SO MANY FOLKS WHO. DON'T KNOW THEIR RIGHTS AND DON'T KNOW LOSS AND IT LEADS TO AGAIN- ON NECESSARY SEARCHES OF VEHICLES MANY TIMES WHEN PEOPLE HAVE NO INTENTIONS OF COMMITTING CRIMES. SIMPLY BECAUSE THEIR- BLINKER DIDN'T WORK OR- ARE YOU STILL THERE TACKS WERE SIX MONTHS. LESS THAN SIX MONTHS- AS THE BILL STATES AND THAT'S NOT HARD TO DISCERN IF IT'S APRIL OF THIS YEAR IN YOUR- DEBT TAX EXPIRED IN DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE. I THINK ANY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL KID CANAL THAT'S WITHIN SIX MONTHS AND- WOULD NOT STOP THEM OR HAS IT EXCEEDED THAT THEY'LL KNOW IT'S MORE THAN SIX MONTHS SO. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. VOTE.
