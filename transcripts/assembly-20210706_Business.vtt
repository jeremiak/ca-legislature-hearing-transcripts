THE PHARMACIST- YOU KNOW

00:38:58.636 --> 00:39:00.237
ALTHOUGH THEY ARE VERY VERY

00:39:00.304 --> 00:39:00.905
WELL TRAINED I WAS VERY

00:39:00.971 --> 00:39:03.074
FORTUNATE. FOR MY OF MY COLLEGE

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:04.308
WE HAVE ONE OF THE BEST

00:39:04.375 --> 00:39:05.543
PHARMACY SCHOOLS IN THE COUNTRY

00:39:05.609 --> 00:39:08.112
AND SO MANY OF MY VERY VERY

00:39:08.179 --> 00:39:08.646
VERY CLOSE FRIENDS A

00:39:08.713 --> 00:39:10.514
PHARMACIST. SOME VERY FAMILIAR

00:39:10.581 --> 00:39:12.450
WITH THEIR TRAINING THEIR SCOPE

00:39:12.516 --> 00:39:13.017
OF TRAINING AND WHAT THEY'RE

00:39:13.084 --> 00:39:15.186
NOT TRAINED FOR. AND SO WHEN I

00:39:15.252 --> 00:39:17.154
LOOK SPECIFICALLY IN MY AREA

00:39:17.221 --> 00:39:19.457
PRACTICE SAID- YOU KNOW S. T.

00:39:19.523 --> 00:39:20.925
S. T. EITHER SECTOR TRANSMIT

00:39:20.991 --> 00:39:23.027
INFECTIONS. KNOWING THAT THERE

00:39:23.094 --> 00:39:25.896
IS AN FDA APPROVED A CLEAR TEST

00:39:25.963 --> 00:39:27.398
FOR GONORRHEA AND CHLAMYDIA

00:39:27.465 --> 00:39:28.132
WHICH WAS APPROVED IN APRIL OF

00:39:28.199 --> 00:39:30.668
THIS YEAR. I DO WONDER WHETHER

00:39:30.735 --> 00:39:32.770
OR NOT- THE PHARMACIST HAS THE

00:39:32.837 --> 00:39:35.973
RIGHT TRAINING TO- COUNSELOR

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:39.210
PATIENT- WHO COMES IN AND THEN

00:39:39.276 --> 00:39:39.810
OF COURSE THEY CAN'T PRESCRIBE

00:39:39.877 --> 00:39:42.613
THE MEDICATION. SO AND THEN

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:46.150

00:39:47.184 --> 00:39:48.486
IRATE ISSUES I DEFINITELY SEE

00:39:48.552 --> 00:39:50.354
THE NEED TO EXPAND THE ABILITY

00:39:50.421 --> 00:39:51.956
FOR PATIENTS TO HAVE ACCESS.

00:39:52.022 --> 00:39:53.390

01:21:16.304 --> 01:21:17.672
ACTUALLY TRUCKS THE LIMITS ARE

01:21:17.739 --> 01:21:19.507
BOTH TECHNOLOGICAL AND

01:21:19.574 --> 01:21:20.709
LOGISTICAL AND THOSE WILL

01:21:20.775 --> 01:21:22.310
REMAIN THERE ARE SOME

01:21:22.377 --> 01:21:23.578
PHARMACIES THAT WILL NOT BE

01:21:23.645 --> 01:21:25.213
ABLE TO DO CERTAIN THINGS THAT

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:27.215
WILL BE APPROPRIATE THEN TO

01:21:27.282 --> 01:21:28.650
HAVE THOSE PATIENTS GO TO OTHER

01:21:28.717 --> 01:21:31.286
PHARMACIES. BUT THE OPPOSITION

01:21:31.353 --> 01:21:33.955
HIDES BEHIND THE TERM SPECIALTY

01:21:34.022 --> 01:21:35.123
WHAT THEY MEAN AND WHAT THEY

01:21:35.190 --> 01:21:36.491
ALWAYS MANAGED BY AND LARGE

01:21:36.558 --> 01:21:38.059
WHEN THEY SAY THAT IS

01:21:38.126 --> 01:21:40.562
EXPENSIVE. AND THEY ANT TO

01:21:40.629 --> 01:21:41.997
CONTROL THE DISPENSING OF

01:21:42.063 --> 01:21:45.133
EXPENSIVE DRUGS AND JUST

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:46.534
BECAUSE A DRUG IS EXPENSIVE AND

01:21:46.601 --> 01:21:48.303
THEREFORE DESIGNATED STRICTLY

01:21:48.370 --> 01:21:50.272
DRUG DOES NOT MEAN THAT OTHER

01:21:50.338 --> 01:21:51.806
PHARMACIES CANNOT DISPENSE IT

01:21:51.873 --> 01:21:53.675
IN FACT IN MANY INSTANCES HAVE

01:21:53.742 --> 01:21:56.144
ALREADY BEEN DISPENSING IT WHEN

01:21:56.211 --> 01:21:59.981

PROVIDERS AND L. A. COUNTY-

01:22:23.171 --> 01:22:24.372
TODAY I'M JUST GOING TO FOCUS

01:22:24.439 --> 01:22:25.640
MY COMMENTS ON HOW PATIENTS

01:22:25.707 --> 01:22:27.942
DURING IMPACTS. PEOPLE WITH HIV

01:22:28.009 --> 01:22:30.712
AND OTHER CHRONIC CONDITIONS.

01:22:30.779 --> 01:22:31.980
MOST IMPORTANTLY THIS PRACTICE

01:22:32.047 --> 01:22:33.415
UNDERMINES THE REALLY CRITICAL

01:22:33.481 --> 01:22:35.450
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PATIENTS

01:22:35.517 --> 01:22:36.985
ON THE APARTMENT THAT. MANY

01:22:37.052 --> 01:22:38.787
PATIENTS DEPENDS ON THIS

01:22:38.853 --> 01:22:40.755
PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP SOMETIMES

01:22:40.822 --> 01:22:42.090
SOMEONE THEY'VE KNOWN FOR YEARS

01:22:42.157 --> 01:22:43.191
TO PROVIDE ACCURATE

01:22:43.258 --> 01:22:45.226
INFORMATION. ABOUT SIDE EFFECTS

01:22:45.293 --> 01:22:46.227
AND TO HELP THEM REMAIN

01:22:46.294 --> 01:22:47.962
INSURANCE THEIR MEDICATION.

01:22:48.029 --> 01:22:49.464
THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR

01:22:49.531 --> 01:22:51.299
PEOPLE WITH HIV. AND OTHER

01:22:51.366 --> 01:22:53.201
CHRONIC CONDITION. PATIENTS

01:22:53.268 --> 01:22:54.402
HEARING COULD ALSO CREATE

01:22:54.469 --> 01:22:55.704
SIGNIFICANT PRIVACY ISSUES

01:22:55.770 --> 01:22:57.739
ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. OF

01:22:57.806 --> 01:22:59.040
PEOPLE EXPERIENCING DOMESTIC

01:22:59.107 --> 01:23:00.375
VIOLENCE AND THOSE LIVING IN

01:23:00.442 --> 01:23:02.377
MORE RURAL AREAS. IF THE

01:23:02.444 --> 01:23:04.479
PATIENT CAN'T PICK UP THEIR

01:23:04.546 --> 01:23:05.280
MEDICATION AT THE PHARMACY OF

01:23:05.347 --> 01:23:07.515
CHOICE. AND ESPECIALLY IF THEY

01:23:07.582 --> 01:23:08.950
ARE REQUIRED TO USE MAIL ORDER.

01:23:09.017 --> 01:23:10.185
SOMEONE COULD FIND OUT ABOUT

01:23:10.251 --> 01:23:11.820
THEIR MEDICAL CONDITION WHICH

01:23:11.886 --> 01:23:13.154
OF COURSE COULD HAVE DISASTROUS

01:23:13.221 --> 01:23:15.323
CONSEQUENCES. AND IT CREEK

01:23:15.390 --> 01:23:17.125
LIKELY. FOR THESE REASONS THE

01:23:17.192 --> 01:23:18.727
MANDATORY MAIL ORDER HAS LONG

01:23:18.793 --> 01:23:20.195
BEEN RECOGNIZED TO BE AN

01:23:20.261 --> 01:23:22.297
APPROPRIATE. AND EVEN UNLAWFUL

01:23:22.364 --> 01:23:24.833
FOR PEOPLE WITH HIV- AND LASTLY

01:23:24.899 --> 01:23:25.767
JUST WANT TO STRESS THE

01:23:25.834 --> 01:23:27.635
IMPORTANCE OF PATIENTS BEING

01:23:27.702 --> 01:23:28.103
ABLE TO PICK UP THEIR

01:23:28.169 --> 01:23:30.405
MEDICATION. AT A PHARMACY WHERE

01:23:30.472 --> 01:23:31.439
APARTMENTS TO SPEAK THEIR

01:23:31.506 --> 01:23:33.441
LANGUAGE AND WHERE THEY KNOW

01:23:33.508 --> 01:23:34.442
THEY WILL RECEIVE CULTURALLY

01:23:34.509 --> 01:23:37.679

COMPETENT PROVIDER. IS ONE OF

01:23:41.683 --> 01:23:43.118
THE BIGGEST REASONS THE PEOPLE

FALL OUT OF CARE. THIS IS

01:23:44.552 --> 01:23:46.721
ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR LGBT PEOPLE

01:23:46.788 --> 01:23:48.456
AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AND

01:23:48.523 --> 01:23:50.325

THE UNDERLYING BILL. FOR TWO

01:25:50.411 --> 01:25:52.747
REASONS ONE IT IS IT TAKES AWAY

01:25:52.814 --> 01:25:53.281
ONE OF THE IMPORTANT COST

01:25:53.348 --> 01:25:55.850
SAVINGS TOOLS. AVAILABLE TO

01:25:55.917 --> 01:25:58.086
HELP PLANS PROVIDED BY PBMS

01:25:58.152 --> 01:25:59.921
THAT ENABLE THEM TO STRESS

01:25:59.988 --> 01:26:00.555
THEIR HEALTHCARE DOLLARS AS FAR

01:26:00.622 --> 01:26:03.191

OF YOU KNOW PATIENTS DURING-

01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:07.395
WHICH WE DISAGREE WITH THE

01:26:07.462 --> 01:26:08.830
PREMISE EVEN EXISTING. IT

01:26:08.897 --> 01:26:10.064
REALLY COMES DOWN TO THE MARKET

01:26:10.131 --> 01:26:11.533
SHARE TRYING TO GET MORE THE

01:26:11.599 --> 01:26:12.967
MARKET SHARE SO LET'S HAVE A

01:26:13.034 --> 01:26:14.669
LET'S HAVE AN OPEN DISCUSSION

01:26:14.736 --> 01:26:16.538
ABOUT THAT BUT NOT DO IT UNDER

01:26:16.604 --> 01:26:17.972
THE GUISE OF SOMETHING THAT

01:26:18.039 --> 01:26:24.579
SIMPLY DOESN'T EXIST- SO. ALL

01:26:24.646 --> 01:26:25.179
OF THOSE TOOLS GOING TO AT THE

01:26:25.246 --> 01:26:26.681

01:26:26.748 --> 01:26:28.550

WOULDN'T I WOULD ADD THAT. IT'S

01:26:38.426 --> 01:26:40.028
A RATHER THAT COST THE ONLY

01:26:40.094 --> 01:26:41.029
THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:26:41.095 --> 01:26:43.464
USES IN ITS DEFINITION. OF

01:26:43.531 --> 01:26:44.666
ESPECIALLY TRUCKS SO WE THINK

01:26:44.732 --> 01:26:45.733
IT IS RELEVANT FOR THIS

01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:47.035
DEFINITION TO BE CONSISTENT

01:26:47.101 --> 01:26:48.202
WITH FEDERAL REGULATIONS AS

01:26:48.269 --> 01:26:50.772
WELL. ALSO SPECIALLY

01:26:50.838 --> 01:26:54.208
PHARMACIES- OPEN PPO CONTRACTS

01:26:54.275 --> 01:26:55.543

ACCREDITATION STANDARDS. AND

01:26:59.247 --> 01:27:02.350

TO PROVIDE PATIENT PROTECTION.

01:35:25.853 --> 01:35:27.488
WHILE IT IS BEEN CHARACTERIZED

01:35:27.555 --> 01:35:28.556
THAT THE BILL IS CONSUMER

01:35:28.622 --> 01:35:30.624
FRIENDLY WHICH IT IS IT IS ALSO

01:35:30.691 --> 01:35:32.359
VERY BUSINESS FRIENDLY. NOW WHY
