NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE

LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT IS

01:26:41.663 --> 01:26:45.366
NOT HISTORICALLY ACCURATE AND

01:26:45.433 --> 01:26:50.972

HE DISCOVERED AMERICA AND OF

01:27:15.229 --> 01:27:16.764
COURSE THERE'S BEEN A DEBATE

01:27:16.831 --> 01:27:17.999
ABOUT WHETHER HE DID THAT

01:27:18.066 --> 01:27:18.499
BECAUSE AMERICA ALREADY

01:27:18.566 --> 01:27:20.568
EXISTED. AND THAT'S NOT WHAT HE

01:27:20.635 --> 01:27:23.371
IS RECOGNIZED FOR IN SCIENCE

01:27:23.438 --> 01:27:24.939
CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS DID NOT

01:27:25.006 --> 01:27:27.976
DISCOVER AMERICA WHAT HE DID

01:27:28.042 --> 01:27:30.178

COMPLETELY NEW NEW CULTURES

01:27:47.962 --> 01:27:50.098
WERE FORMED THAT EXISTED IN

01:27:50.164 --> 01:27:53.334
AMERICA FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS.

01:27:53.401 --> 01:27:57.105

EUROPE AND THEN THEY WERE

01:28:18.159 --> 01:28:21.095
SEPARATED. THE SAILING ACROSS

01:28:21.162 --> 01:28:22.530
THE ATLANTIC BY CHRISTOPHER

DISCOVERED AMERICA FALSELY WE

01:28:48.890 --> 01:28:50.224

CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS MADE A

01:28:52.393 --> 01:28:54.662
CONTRIBUTION TO THE AMERICAS

01:28:54.729 --> 01:28:57.265
THE NO OTHER PERSON IN HISTORY

IS ABOUT WAR. IT'S ABOUT

01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:50.478
CONFLICT IN SOME OF OUR BIGGEST

01:31:01.989 --> 01:31:03.991
REALLY A FEW MORE OIL IS DOWN

AGREE WITH THEM OR NOT. IT'S

01:31:22.109 --> 01:31:25.213
JUST SOMETHING THAT MAKES US

01:31:25.279 --> 01:31:27.114
THE WORLD POWER THAT WE ARE IN

01:31:27.181 --> 01:31:29.884
SO OUR HISTORY. IS SOMETHING

01:31:29.951 --> 01:31:31.319
THAT EVERYONE HAS PARTICIPATED

01:31:31.385 --> 01:31:33.321
IN THAT IS CONTRIBUTED IN

01:31:33.387 --> 01:31:35.923
MAKING WHO WE ARE SO WHY IN

01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:37.825
PARTICULAR SCRUTINY SPECIAL SET

01:31:37.892 --> 01:31:40.094
OF IT BEING PUNISHED. HE'S

01:31:40.161 --> 01:31:41.963
ACTUALLY THE ONLY PERSON IN

01:31:42.029 --> 01:31:43.865
AMERICAN HISTORY. WHO

01:31:43.931 --> 01:31:46.367
SUCCESSFULLY ADVOCATED FOR

01:31:46.434 --> 01:31:48.736
NATIVE AMERICANS AND PUT LAWS

01:31:48.803 --> 01:31:51.372
IN PLACE TO PROTECT NATIVE

01:31:51.439 --> 01:31:54.542
AMERICANS SO WHY IS HE BEEN

01:31:54.609 --> 01:31:59.280
ACCUSED ACTUALLY OF. HER NAME

01:31:59.347 --> 01:32:02.116
VIOLATING INSULATING NATIVE

01:32:02.183 --> 01:32:04.719
AMERICANS THAT'S A GOOD

01:32:04.785 --> 01:32:05.353
QUESTION BECAUSE HE DID NONE OF

01:32:05.419 --> 01:32:08.022
THAT. ONE OF THE LAWS THAT HE

01:32:08.089 --> 01:32:10.358
PUT INTO PLACE REQUIRED THE

01:32:10.424 --> 01:32:13.995
REMOVAL OF THE ACTING GOVERNOR

01:32:14.061 --> 01:32:15.529
AT THE TIME WHO WAS WHO WAS

01:32:15.596 --> 01:32:17.498
HARMING NATIVE AMERICANS SAID

01:32:17.565 --> 01:32:19.500
HE DISAGREED WITH THAT AND THE

01:32:19.567 --> 01:32:20.835
ONLY WAY HE THOUGHT HE COULD

01:32:20.902 --> 01:32:22.136
PROTECTED OF AMERICANS WAS TO

01:32:22.203 --> 01:32:23.571
REMOVE THAT FIGURE WHICH IS

01:32:23.638 --> 01:32:25.873
SUCCESSFULLY DID THE NEXT THING

01:32:25.940 --> 01:32:27.341
THAT HE ADVOCATED FOR WAS THAT

01:32:27.408 --> 01:32:30.011
THE NATIVE AMERICANS. ACTUALLY

01:32:30.077 --> 01:32:31.612
BE ALLOWED TO INTEGRATE INTO

01:32:31.679 --> 01:32:33.047
COMMUNITIES AND EVENTUALLY ON

01:32:33.114 --> 01:32:36.317
LAND THAT'S NOT EVEN SOMETHING

01:32:36.384 --> 01:32:39.921
THAT WE ALLOW TO DIE BUT HE DID

01:32:39.987 --> 01:32:44.558
MET NUMEROUS THINGS TO ADVOCATE

01:32:44.625 --> 01:32:46.227
FOR NATIVE AMERICANS ONE OF THE

01:32:46.294 --> 01:32:48.296
THINGS THAT HE'S ACCUSED OF IN

01:32:48.362 --> 01:32:50.364
A COMMENT HE MENTIONED SHACKLES

01:32:50.431 --> 01:32:52.233
OF PUTTING PEOPLE IN SHACKLES

01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:53.067
BECAUSE BACK THEN THEY DIDN'T

01:32:53.134 --> 01:32:55.236
HAVE JAILS OR PRISONS AND HE

01:32:55.303 --> 01:32:56.904
WAS MAKING A COMMENT TOWER UP

01:32:56.971 --> 01:32:58.372
HOLDING THE LAW AND ANYBODY

01:32:58.439 --> 01:33:00.942
THAT BROKE IT. INCLUDING NATIVE

01:33:01.008 --> 01:33:02.376
AMERICANS SHOULD BE SHACKLED

01:33:02.443 --> 01:33:04.679
BUT THAT WAS VERY MUCH IN TUNE

01:33:04.745 --> 01:33:05.913
WITH OUR VALUES TODAY WE

01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:08.215
BELIEVE IN LAW AND ORDER WE

01:33:08.282 --> 01:33:09.917
BELIEVE IN MAKING LAWS AND IF

01:33:09.984 --> 01:33:11.152
ANYBODY DOESN'T RESPECT THEM

01:33:11.218 --> 01:33:13.287
THEY SHOULD BE PUNISHED AND HE

01:33:13.354 --> 01:33:16.958
WAS CREATING A SOCIETY OF

01:33:17.024 --> 01:33:20.628
ORDERS WILL AS HE SOUGHT SO HE

01:33:20.695 --> 01:33:22.063
WAS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT

01:33:22.129 --> 01:33:24.699
PEOPLE IN OUR HISTORY AT

01:33:24.765 --> 01:33:26.334
CREATING COMMUNITIES IN

01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:28.336
CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE PERSISTED

01:33:28.402 --> 01:33:29.937
THAT NOW CREATED SOME OF THE

01:33:30.004 --> 01:33:31.138
MOST IMPORTANT CITIES IN THE

01:33:31.205 --> 01:33:33.240
WORLD AND TO OUR STATE. THE

01:33:33.307 --> 01:33:34.675
CITY OF SAN DIEGO THE CITY OF

01:33:34.742 --> 01:33:36.043
LOS ANGELES CITY OF SAN

01:33:36.110 --> 01:33:38.746
FRANCISCO ADDITIONAL CITIES

01:33:38.813 --> 01:33:40.681
LIKE MON MODERATE IMPORTANT

01:33:40.748 --> 01:33:41.782
CITIES C. R. THESE ARE

01:33:41.849 --> 01:33:43.484
IMPORTANT COMMUNITIES BUT HAVE

01:33:43.551 --> 01:33:45.853
A FOUNDATION IN SOMETHING THAT

01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:47.955
HE STARTED. BUT DID NOT BUILD A

01:33:48.022 --> 01:33:51.125
LONG NONE OF THIS HE DID A LOT

01:33:51.192 --> 01:33:53.861
AND NONE OF THIS WAS ENTIRELY

01:33:53.928 --> 01:33:55.529
AS HE ENVISIONED BUT NATIVE

01:33:55.596 --> 01:33:57.865
AMERICANS WERE VERY IMPORTANT

01:33:57.932 --> 01:34:00.001
TO ANYTHING HE DID THEY WOULD

01:34:00.067 --> 01:34:02.303
NOT BEEN A SINGLE COMMUNITY

01:34:02.370 --> 01:34:04.405
BUILT IF IT WASN'T. FOR THE

01:34:04.472 --> 01:34:06.340
INVOLVEMENT AND PARTICIPATION

01:34:06.407 --> 01:34:09.243
OF NATIVE AMERICANS AND THAT IS

01:34:09.310 --> 01:34:11.445
OFTEN MIS CHARACTERIZED SAYING

01:34:11.512 --> 01:34:12.780
THAT HE HELD A GUN TO THEIR

01:34:12.847 --> 01:34:14.115
HEAD AND SAID YOU MUST DO

01:34:14.181 --> 01:34:15.449
SOMETHING THAT IT'S- NOT

01:34:15.516 --> 01:34:18.285
ACCURATE EVERY TIME NATIVE

01:34:18.352 --> 01:34:20.554
AMERICANS IN A MISSION

01:34:20.621 --> 01:34:22.223
COMMUNITY WERE MISTREATED. THEY

01:34:22.289 --> 01:34:25.860
REBELLED AND THEY BURNT DOWN

01:34:25.926 --> 01:34:29.030
THE MISSIONS THEY THEY ENDED

01:34:29.096 --> 01:34:30.698
MANY MISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA

01:34:30.765 --> 01:34:33.868
FROM ARE FROM CALIFORNIA ALL

01:34:33.934 --> 01:34:35.236
THE WAY TO BACK ON THE PHONE A

01:34:35.302 --> 01:34:37.171
LOT WERE NATE DIDN'T END IT

01:34:37.238 --> 01:34:38.773
BECAUSE THE NATIVE AMERICANS

01:34:38.839 --> 01:34:40.875
REFUSED TO PARTICIPATE. AND

01:34:40.941 --> 01:34:44.845
THEY ACTUALLY MADE WAR AGAINST

01:34:44.912 --> 01:34:47.581
THE SETTLERS AND THEY KILL THEM

01:34:47.648 --> 01:34:48.149
AND A LOT OF THOSE MISSIONS

01:34:48.215 --> 01:34:51.852
FAILED IN IN IN SAN DIEGO A

01:34:51.919 --> 01:34:55.990
MISSION THAT- SO FAR- NOW ST

01:34:56.057 --> 01:34:59.527
CRITICAL SET UP FUND IT IN

01:34:59.593 --> 01:35:00.127
SEVENTEEN SIXTY NINE THAT WAS

01:35:00.194 --> 01:35:03.364
ENOUGH OPERATING IN IN

01:35:03.431 --> 01:35:04.698
SEVENTEEN SEVENTY FOUR. THAT

01:35:04.765 --> 01:35:07.268
LED TO THE KILLING OF SOME

01:35:07.334 --> 01:35:10.237
PRIESTS WERE THERE. AND THE

01:35:10.304 --> 01:35:11.972
BURNING OF THE MISSION AND CAN

01:35:12.039 --> 01:35:13.641
BETTER COOPER SAID I HAD TO

01:35:13.707 --> 01:35:16.110
TRAVEL FROM MONTEREY BACK TO

01:35:16.177 --> 01:35:18.112
SAN DIEGO BUT THEN IMAGINE

01:35:18.179 --> 01:35:19.647
TRAVELING DOWN THERE WAS A VERY

01:35:19.713 --> 01:35:21.348
DIFFICULT THING. AND WHEN HE

01:35:21.415 --> 01:35:24.151
WENT BACK THE MISSION WAS RE

01:35:24.218 --> 01:35:26.420
ESTABLISHED NOT BY FORCE NOT BY

01:35:26.487 --> 01:35:28.689
MILITARY POWER. BECAUSE NATIVE

01:35:28.756 --> 01:35:30.558
AMERICANS RESPECTED HIM AND

01:35:30.624 --> 01:35:31.158
THERE WAS A THERE WAS A

01:35:31.225 --> 01:35:33.494
MISUNDERSTANDING. LED TO THAT

01:35:33.561 --> 01:35:36.363
THAT WAS CORRECTED AND SO THESE

01:35:36.430 --> 01:35:37.731
COMMUNITIES WOULD HAVE NOT

01:35:37.798 --> 01:35:42.770
ASSISTED IF IT HAD BEEN FOR THE

01:35:42.837 --> 01:35:44.371
USE OF SLAVERY IN MILITARY

01:35:44.438 --> 01:35:46.740
MIGHT BECAUSE YOU CAN'T

01:35:46.807 --> 01:35:50.211
UNDERESTIMATE THE STRENGTH AND

01:35:50.277 --> 01:35:51.378
THE POWER THAT NATIVE AMERICANS

01:35:51.445 --> 01:35:53.581
HAD THEY WERE VERY LARGE

01:35:53.647 --> 01:35:54.982
COMMUNITIES MADE UP OF

01:35:55.049 --> 01:35:57.118
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT WERE

01:35:57.184 --> 01:35:59.954
THEMSELVES AMAZING WARRIORS

01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:00.988
NATIVE AMERICANS WERE

01:36:01.055 --> 01:36:03.924
INCREDIBLE WARRIORS OFTEN

01:36:03.991 --> 01:36:04.892
FOUGHT AMONG THEMSELVES AND

01:36:04.959 --> 01:36:07.328
OFTEN EVEN ENSLAVED OTHER

01:36:07.394 --> 01:36:10.131
TRIBES SLAVERY WAS A THING OF

01:36:10.197 --> 01:36:13.234
THE DAY AND I NEED TO SPEAK TO

01:36:13.300 --> 01:36:15.302
SLAVERY BECAUSE SLAVERY IN THIS

01:36:15.369 --> 01:36:18.339
BILL IS GROSSLY GROSSLY

01:36:18.405 --> 01:36:22.543
MISREPRESENTED BECAUSE WHAT IT

01:36:22.610 --> 01:36:24.478
MAKES REFERENCE TO A LAW THAT

01:36:24.545 --> 01:36:27.515
WAS PASSED BY THE KING IN THE

01:36:27.581 --> 01:36:28.282
SIXTEEN HUNDREDS THAT OUTLAWED

01:36:28.349 --> 01:36:31.085
SLAVERY AND THE OUTLAWED THE

01:36:31.152 --> 01:36:32.953
SLAVERY OF NATIVE AMERICANS IT

01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:35.089
FILLS OUT LOUD BUT HOW COULD

01:36:35.156 --> 01:36:37.791
THEY ENGAGE IN AND WHO NEED

01:36:37.858 --> 01:36:40.194
MENTAL SET ALSO. DID NOT

01:36:40.261 --> 01:36:41.896
SUPPORT SLAVERY IN FACT.

01:36:41.962 --> 01:36:43.664
SLAVERY WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT

01:36:43.731 --> 01:36:46.901
WAS REALLY. IN IN PUT IT INTO

01:36:46.967 --> 01:36:49.403
LAW IN MEXICO WAS ACTUALLY

01:36:49.470 --> 01:36:52.506
OUTLAWED. IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY

01:36:52.573 --> 01:36:55.409
NINE BECAUSE SLAVERY BEGAN TO

01:36:55.476 --> 01:36:57.711
BE INTRODUCED INTO MEXICAN

01:36:57.778 --> 01:37:00.247
TERRITORY THROUGH TEXAS. ONE

01:37:00.314 --> 01:37:02.483
EIGHT OUTLAWED SLAVERY THAT

01:37:02.550 --> 01:37:05.452
CREATED THE CONFLICT THAT MADE-

01:37:05.519 --> 01:37:09.757
TEXAS SEPARATE FROM MEXICO BACK

01:37:09.823 --> 01:37:11.926
IN THE THIRTIES AND IT BLED IT

01:37:11.992 --> 01:37:13.527
WAS ALL A DIRECT RESULT OF THE

01:37:13.594 --> 01:37:15.229
ELIMINATION OF SLAVERY IN

01:37:15.296 --> 01:37:18.132
MEXICO SO IN IN ADDITION TO

01:37:18.199 --> 01:37:20.568
THAT SLAVERY WAS NOT ALLOWED IN

01:37:20.634 --> 01:37:23.437
IN IN- CALIFORNIA THINGS WILL

01:37:23.504 --> 01:37:25.339
IT REALLY WENT WRONG IN

01:37:25.406 --> 01:37:27.341
CALIFORNIA IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY.

01:37:27.408 --> 01:37:28.576
WHEN CALIFORNIA BECAME A STATE

01:37:28.642 --> 01:37:30.344
IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY THE FIRST LAW

01:37:30.411 --> 01:37:33.380
THE PAST WAS A LAW THAT ALLOWED

01:37:33.447 --> 01:37:35.182
THE SLAVE AND SLAVE MINUTES OF

01:37:35.249 --> 01:37:37.151
NATIVE AMERICANS THROUGH A LAW

01:37:37.218 --> 01:37:40.187
THAT ALLOWED- CALIFORNIANS TO

01:37:40.254 --> 01:37:42.623
KILL NATIVE AMERICANS AND TO

01:37:42.690 --> 01:37:44.725
TAKE THEIR CHILDREN. AND TO

01:37:44.792 --> 01:37:46.160
INDENTURE ANY NON NATIVE

01:37:46.227 --> 01:37:49.029
AMERICAN BASIS ALL IS NOT

01:37:49.096 --> 01:37:50.497
GAINFULLY EMPLOYED AND THAT WAS

01:37:50.564 --> 01:37:52.499
A FORM OF SLAVERY THAT WAS

01:37:52.566 --> 01:37:54.568
ALLOWED BACK THEN BIG GAVE

01:37:54.635 --> 01:37:59.340
RISE. TO THE EXTERMINATION OF

01:37:59.406 --> 01:38:01.642
NATIVE AMERICANS THE REAL

01:38:01.709 --> 01:38:04.211
PROBLEMS BEGAN IN CALIFORNIA

01:38:04.278 --> 01:38:05.412
AGAINST THE NATIVE AMERICANS IF

01:38:05.479 --> 01:38:07.848
THEY WERE HAVING PROBLEMS THE

01:38:07.915 --> 01:38:08.949
REAL ONE STARTED IN NINETEEN

01:38:09.016 --> 01:38:11.285
FIFTY. AND THERE WERE PEOPLE

01:38:11.352 --> 01:38:13.721
THAT WE HONOR TODAY IN OUR

01:38:13.787 --> 01:38:15.389
STATE GROUNDS AND IN OTHER

01:38:15.456 --> 01:38:19.360
PLACES THAT TOOK A HAND IN

01:38:19.426 --> 01:38:21.262
INSULATING THE INDIANS IN

01:38:21.328 --> 01:38:23.330
MISTREATING THEM AND KILLING AN

01:38:23.397 --> 01:38:26.367
ACTUAL GENOCIDE LOVE IN FACT WE

01:38:26.433 --> 01:38:27.868
HAVE A THE ENTIRE WHOLE

01:38:27.935 --> 01:38:30.170
RECOGNIZING GOVERNORS THAT

01:38:30.237 --> 01:38:31.672
PASSED LAWS IN THIS VERY

01:38:31.739 --> 01:38:34.275
BUILDING AGAINST NATIVE

01:38:34.341 --> 01:38:36.377
AMERICANS I DON'T SEE US

01:38:36.443 --> 01:38:38.512
REMOVING THEIR NAMES I DON'T

01:38:38.579 --> 01:38:39.913
SEE US REMOVING THEM FROM THE

01:38:39.980 --> 01:38:45.886
GROUNDS I DON'T SEE US BOB-

01:38:45.953 --> 01:38:47.988
TEARING DOWN THIS BUILDING

01:38:48.055 --> 01:38:51.158
WHICH IS AS MUCH A SYMBOL OF

01:38:51.225 --> 01:38:53.260
COLONIZATION IS ANYTHING ELSE

01:38:53.327 --> 01:38:54.662
INCLUDING WHAT WE DO AS A

01:38:54.728 --> 01:38:57.197
GOVERNMENT I AM VEHEMENTLY

01:38:57.264 --> 01:38:59.833
OPPOSED TO EVERYTHING THAT IS

01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:01.702
HAPPENING THIS PROCESS BECAUSE-

01:39:01.769 --> 01:39:04.038
YOU KNOW GROWING UP AS A LATINO

01:39:04.104 --> 01:39:06.373
IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S HARD TO

01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:08.609
FIND HISTORICAL FIGURES THAT

01:39:08.676 --> 01:39:09.777
MADE A CONTRIBUTION TO OUR

01:39:09.843 --> 01:39:13.881
SOCIETY THAT COME FROM MY

01:39:13.947 --> 01:39:15.916
HERITAGE FOR MY BACKGROUND.

01:39:15.983 --> 01:39:17.551
THAT PART OF NATIVE AMERICAN

01:39:17.618 --> 01:39:20.487
DESCENT. OF SPANISH DESCENT OR

01:39:20.554 --> 01:39:23.157
MEXICAN DESCENT MOSTLY OUR

01:39:23.223 --> 01:39:25.192
HISTORY IS VILIFIED THOSE

01:39:25.259 --> 01:39:27.361
INDIVIDUALS AND GROWING UP IN

01:39:27.428 --> 01:39:30.264
THE STATE WITHOUT HEROES FOR A

01:39:30.331 --> 01:39:32.866
PUBLIC FIGURES TO LEARN FROM AN

01:39:32.933 --> 01:39:36.003
ASPIRE TO AND LEARN THAT IN THE

01:39:36.070 --> 01:39:37.871
STATE THAT I WAS BORN IN THEY

01:39:37.938 --> 01:39:42.776
WERE. LATINOS AND- ITS PARTNERS

01:39:42.843 --> 01:39:45.012
MAKING HISTORY HERE. LONG

01:39:45.079 --> 01:39:52.720
BEFORE I WAS BORN DATING BACK.

01:39:52.786 --> 01:39:55.155
215-402-2160 WE HAD PEOPLE

01:39:55.222 --> 01:39:57.591
MAKING HISTORY HERE IN THE

01:39:57.658 --> 01:39:59.793
STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT NONE OF

01:39:59.860 --> 01:40:02.096
THEM ARE REFLECTED WHEN WE

01:40:02.162 --> 01:40:04.131
FINALLY GOT ONE THIS MONUMENT

01:40:04.198 --> 01:40:06.467
THAT WILL BE REMOVED TO PUT IT

01:40:06.533 --> 01:40:08.302
BUT ARE SET ON THE GROUNDS AND

01:40:08.369 --> 01:40:10.237
HOW DO I KNOW. IT WILL BE

01:40:10.304 --> 01:40:11.238
REMOVED BECAUSE I GOT

01:40:11.305 --> 01:40:12.740
CONFIRMATION FROM THE AUTHOR

01:40:12.806 --> 01:40:14.708
THE IT WILL BE REMOVED. AND

01:40:14.775 --> 01:40:17.778
THIS BASICALLY BILL SETS UP THE

01:40:17.845 --> 01:40:21.181
PROCESS TO REMOVE. A MONUMENT

01:40:21.248 --> 01:40:24.151
THAT IS NOT A HISTORICAL ALL OF

01:40:24.218 --> 01:40:25.652
THE HISTORICAL VALUE AND

01:40:25.719 --> 01:40:28.422
PROTECTED UNDER CALIFORNIA LAWS

01:40:28.489 --> 01:40:30.958
THIS BILL DOES NOT AT ALL MAKE

01:40:31.024 --> 01:40:33.627
MENTION OF THE FACT THAT THAT

01:40:33.694 --> 01:40:35.396
IS A HISTORICAL SITE. AND IT

01:40:35.462 --> 01:40:38.432
SHOULD BE PROTECTED BUT IT PUTS

01:40:38.499 --> 01:40:42.302
IT ON THE PATH TO BE REMOVED

01:40:42.369 --> 01:40:45.239
THEY'RE REMOVING STARKEL FIGURE

01:40:45.305 --> 01:40:48.075
THAT IS OF SPANISH HERITAGE THE

01:40:48.142 --> 01:40:50.544
ONLY ONE THAT WE HAVE. AND

01:40:50.611 --> 01:40:53.013
REPLACING IT WITH A MONUMENT TO

01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:54.181
NATIVE AMERICANS WHICH I

01:40:54.248 --> 01:40:57.684
BELIEVE IS A HAVING A MONUMENT

01:40:57.751 --> 01:40:58.285
TO A NATIVE AMERICANS I THINK

01:40:58.352 --> 01:41:00.954
IS ESSENTIAL BUT BUILDING IT ON

01:41:01.021 --> 01:41:03.290
A HISTORICAL SITE OF HONOR

01:41:03.357 --> 01:41:04.925
SOMEBODY THAT MADE A HUGE

01:41:04.992 --> 01:41:08.095
CONTRIBUTION TO OUR STATE IS A

01:41:08.162 --> 01:41:12.933
HUGE MISTAKE CREATING A SCAR

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:13.934
YOU'RE CREATING AN EMOTIONAL

01:41:14.001 --> 01:41:15.936
SCAR AND ON THAT YOU'RE GONNA

01:41:16.003 --> 01:41:19.039
PUT ANOTHER MONUMENT THAT.

01:41:19.106 --> 01:41:20.941
HONORS A DIFFERENT GROUP OF

01:41:21.008 --> 01:41:21.642
PEOPLE I AM BOTH NATIVE

01:41:21.708 --> 01:41:24.912
AMERICAN AND SPANISH DESCENT

01:41:24.978 --> 01:41:29.283
AND I'M VERY PROUD OF BOTH MY

01:41:29.349 --> 01:41:33.754
NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE AND MY

01:41:33.821 --> 01:41:36.223
SPANISH MEXICAN HERITAGE AND

01:41:36.290 --> 01:41:38.325
THIS BILL MAKES ME CHOOSE

01:41:38.392 --> 01:41:40.294
BETWEEN ONE OR THE OTHER AND

01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:41.962
ALL OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT

01:41:42.029 --> 01:41:46.633
ARE OF SPANISH DESCENT AND

01:41:46.700 --> 01:41:48.402
NATIVE AMERICAN SAID IT DOES

01:41:48.469 --> 01:41:51.071
THE VERY SAME THING THE AUTHOR

01:41:51.138 --> 01:41:54.308

INTEND TO GET UP TO SPEED BUT I

01:47:28.408 --> 01:47:31.478
THINK THAT- SENATOR WESSEL

01:47:31.545 --> 01:47:33.547
RAISES SOME VERY IMPORTANT AND

01:47:33.613 --> 01:47:35.982
LEGITIMATE ISSUES HERE AND

01:47:36.049 --> 01:47:38.952
CONCERNS UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T

01:47:39.019 --> 01:47:42.422
THINK THAT THIS IS THE EXACT

01:47:42.489 --> 01:47:44.558
EXACT THIS IS THE EXACT CASE IN

01:47:44.624 --> 01:47:48.895
WHICH I COULD REALLY FIGHT FOR

01:47:48.962 --> 01:47:53.967
AW- THE INCLUSION OF ALL WHEN

01:47:54.034 --> 01:47:56.069
YOU GET A NEW BETTER SANTA TOO

01:47:56.136 --> 01:47:59.739
MANY TOO MANY CONFLICTING AND

01:47:59.806 --> 01:48:02.175
SOME VERY VERY STRONG ARGUMENTS

01:48:02.242 --> 01:48:04.678
AS TO WHY E SHOULD NOT

01:48:04.744 --> 01:48:06.213
CONTINUE TO BE HERE AT THE

01:48:06.279 --> 01:48:08.515
CAPITOL MANY NOT JUST ONE OR

01:48:08.582 --> 01:48:11.418
TWO. AW I THINK IT'S REALLY

01:48:11.484 --> 01:48:13.687
IMPORTANT WHAT SENATOR WESSEL

01:48:13.753 --> 01:48:16.056
SAID SENATOR FROM SAN DIEGO IS

01:48:16.122 --> 01:48:19.860
THAT THERE IS A PART OF HISTORY

01:48:19.926 --> 01:48:21.461
THAT'S GOING TO BE TOLD THROUGH

01:48:21.528 --> 01:48:23.530
THE STATUTE OF A OF A NATIVE

01:48:23.597 --> 01:48:25.966
AMERICAN AND INDIGENOUS PEOPLES

01:48:26.032 --> 01:48:27.500
ARE DEDICATED TO THE INDIGENOUS

01:48:27.567 --> 01:48:29.302
PEOPLES OF THE STATE AND I

01:48:29.369 --> 01:48:31.538
THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT BUT

01:48:31.605 --> 01:48:34.774
THERE IS AS THE SENATOR SAID

01:48:34.841 --> 01:48:38.111
ANOTHER PART A SIGNIFICANT PART

01:48:38.178 --> 01:48:40.046
WHICH IS THE ROLE OF MEXICANS

01:48:40.113 --> 01:48:43.383
IN THIS STATE AND THAT. IS NOT

01:48:43.450 --> 01:48:45.752
BEING TAKEN APPEAR AND WE HAVE

01:48:45.819 --> 01:48:48.188
TO ADDRESS THAT WE JUST UNDER

01:48:48.255 --> 01:48:50.590
THE CENSUS KNOW THAT. LATINOS

01:48:50.657 --> 01:48:54.294
ARE THE LARGEST GROUP HERE IN

01:48:54.361 --> 01:48:56.329
THE STATE SO THERE'S MANY MANY

01:48:56.396 --> 01:48:57.731
THINGS THAT WE STILL HAVE TO

01:48:57.797 --> 01:49:00.033
ADDRESS UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL

01:49:00.100 --> 01:49:01.768
DOES NOT ADDRESS ALL THOSE

01:49:01.835 --> 01:49:04.237
CONCERNS AND ALL THOSE ISUES-

01:49:04.304 --> 01:49:06.439
BUT WE DO NEED TO DO THAT

01:49:06.506 --> 01:49:08.742
INSTEAD OF PITTING. ONE GROUP

01:49:08.808 --> 01:49:12.846
AGAINST ANOTHER SO WHY WHY WILL

01:49:12.913 --> 01:49:15.482
SUPPORT THIS BILL I AGREE IN SO

01:49:15.548 --> 01:49:17.217
MANY WAYS WITH THE SENATOR FROM

01:49:17.284 --> 01:49:19.252
SAN DIEGO SAID AND WE HAVE TO

01:49:19.319 --> 01:49:22.055
FIX IT AND WE WILL FIGURE OUT

01:49:22.122 --> 01:49:23.456
HOW TO FIX THAT THANK YOU THANK

01:49:23.523 --> 01:49:28.194
YOU SENATOR ALAN MEMBERS- VERY

01:49:28.261 --> 01:49:29.262
INTERESTING DISCUSSION I DO

01:49:29.329 --> 01:49:30.497
WANT TO THANK OUR COLLEAGUE

01:49:30.563 --> 01:49:32.565

01:49:32.632 --> 01:49:33.733
EXPOSITION AND ALL THE

01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:34.634
INTERESTING THINGS HE HAD TO

01:49:34.701 --> 01:49:36.636
SAY I AGREE THAT THERE ARE SOME

01:49:36.703 --> 01:49:38.104
OF THE LANGUAGE IN THE AND

01:49:38.171 --> 01:49:39.205
INTENT LANGUAGE HERE THAT I

01:49:39.272 --> 01:49:41.374
THINK GOES A LITTLE FAR I THINK

01:49:41.441 --> 01:49:43.710
THAT- PART OF WHAT IS HAPPENING

01:49:43.777 --> 01:49:46.746
IS THAT FATHER SET EYES.

01:49:46.813 --> 01:49:48.915
BASICALLY AND A SYMBOL OF THE

01:49:48.982 --> 01:49:52.452
ENTIRE OUR MISSION SYSTEM AND

01:49:52.519 --> 01:49:54.487
ALL OF ITS EXCESSES- BECAUSE

01:49:54.554 --> 01:49:56.056
THAT'S PART OF WHY HE WAS

01:49:56.122 --> 01:49:56.823
COMMEMORATED IN THE FIRST

01:49:56.890 --> 01:50:00.093

BECAUSE HE'S A SYMBOL IS A

01:50:07.233 --> 01:50:09.602
SYMBOL OF. OF NOT ONLY THE

01:50:09.669 --> 01:50:10.437
DISCOVERY BUT THE ULTIMATE

01:50:10.503 --> 01:50:12.772
COLONIZATION ALL THE PAIN AND

01:50:12.839 --> 01:50:15.408
HARDSHIP THAT WAS INCURRED- I

01:50:15.475 --> 01:50:17.877
GUESS I HEARD WHAT I I'M

01:50:17.944 --> 01:50:19.879
CERTAINLY DISTURBED HERE THE-

01:50:19.946 --> 01:50:21.114
THE LACK OF COMMUNICATION

01:50:21.181 --> 01:50:22.415
BETWEEN THE AUTHOR AND OUR

01:50:22.482 --> 01:50:23.917
COLLEAGUE THAT'S REALLY DOES

01:50:23.984 --> 01:50:25.418
CONCERN ME I THAT WAS THE

01:50:25.485 --> 01:50:27.787
EXPECTATION COMING OUT OF JAIL

01:50:27.854 --> 01:50:31.224
COMMITTEE- I WILL SAY THAT I

01:50:31.291 --> 01:50:32.692
I'M NOT SURE THAT I AGREE WITH

01:50:32.759 --> 01:50:34.260
THE SENATORS CHARACTERIZATION

01:50:34.327 --> 01:50:35.395
OF THIS PARTICULAR CITED

01:50:35.462 --> 01:50:37.630
HISTORICAL SITE. OF THE STATUE

01:50:37.697 --> 01:50:38.865
WENT UPIN NINETEEN SIXTY

01:50:38.932 --> 01:50:41.601
SEVEN- YOU KNOW TO BE HONEST I

01:50:41.668 --> 01:50:43.169
I'VE I WENT SAW THAT STATUE

01:50:43.236 --> 01:50:44.671
MANY TIMES DON'T BELIEVE THAT

01:50:44.738 --> 01:50:46.706
TO HAVE PARTICULAR AESTHETIC

01:50:46.773 --> 01:50:49.376
MERIT HI. THERE'S NO THERE'S

01:50:49.442 --> 01:50:51.411
NOTHING ASSOCIATED WITH THE

01:50:51.478 --> 01:50:53.713
SITE- WITH HISTORIC HISTORY

01:50:53.780 --> 01:50:56.750
WITH HISTORIC- A STORY OF

01:50:56.816 --> 01:50:57.751
FATHER SAT OUT THE MISSION

01:50:57.817 --> 01:51:00.053
SYSTEM I JUST HAPPEN TO BE A

01:51:00.120 --> 01:51:01.855
SITE THAT WAS CHOSEN ON OUR

01:51:01.921 --> 01:51:03.656
CAPITOL GROUNDS. ARE THERE

01:51:03.723 --> 01:51:05.825
STILL MANY ALLUSIONS TO THE

01:51:05.892 --> 01:51:07.794
MISSION SYSTEM HERE IN THIS

01:51:07.861 --> 01:51:09.529
BUILDING OUR FATHER SERRA'S

01:51:09.596 --> 01:51:11.531
NAME- IS MENTIONED ON SOME

01:51:11.598 --> 01:51:15.068
MURALS- IT NOBODY'S TALKING

01:51:15.135 --> 01:51:16.536
ABOUT TAKING DOWN HIS STATUE AT

01:51:16.603 --> 01:51:18.304
CARMEL WHICH OF COURSE IS A

01:51:18.371 --> 01:51:20.173
SITE THAT'S VERY MUCH CONNECTED

01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:23.843
WITH HIS LEGACY IN A STORY- SO

01:51:23.910 --> 01:51:28.448
YOU KNOW FROM MY PERSPECTIVE.

01:51:28.515 --> 01:51:29.015
THIS IS THAT. THIS IS NOT A

01:51:29.082 --> 01:51:29.582
IT'S SPECIAL PLAY THEY WERE

01:51:29.649 --> 01:51:31.351
ABOUT WITH REGARD TO. A SARIN

01:51:31.418 --> 01:51:32.919
HIS LEGACY AND LET'S ALSO

01:51:32.986 --> 01:51:33.987
REMIND EVERYBODY THAT THE

01:51:34.054 --> 01:51:35.688
STATUE IS NO LONGER STANDING

01:51:35.755 --> 01:51:38.291
THE QUESTION HERE IS- IS NOT

01:51:38.358 --> 01:51:39.325
WHETHER IT'S NOT ABOUT TAKING

01:51:39.392 --> 01:51:41.594
DOWN A STATUE- IT'S ABOUT

01:51:41.661 --> 01:51:43.129
WHETHER TO PUT IT BACK UP AGAIN

01:51:43.196 --> 01:51:46.800
OR INSTEAD. TO PUT A MONUMENT-

01:51:46.866 --> 01:51:48.802
REFLECTING THE INCREDIBLE

01:51:48.868 --> 01:51:50.703
HERITAGE OF OUR NATIVE AMERICAN

01:51:50.770 --> 01:51:53.606
COMMUNITY I'VE NOW IT'S TRUE

01:51:53.673 --> 01:51:55.141
THE MINUTE WAS TORN DOWN TORN

01:51:55.208 --> 01:51:58.344
DOWN BY- THE PEOPLE WHO WERE

01:51:58.411 --> 01:52:00.480
VANDALISING. OUR CAPITOL

01:52:00.547 --> 01:52:01.748
GROUNDS AND SO THAT'S A THAT'S

01:52:01.815 --> 01:52:03.116
A DIFFICULT QUESTION AS WELL

01:52:03.183 --> 01:52:03.950
BUT I GUESS FROM MY

01:52:04.017 --> 01:52:06.653
PERSPECTIVE- GIVEN THE FACT

01:52:06.719 --> 01:52:08.354
THAT THIS SITE DOESN'T HAVE ANY

01:52:08.421 --> 01:52:11.491
PARTICULAR SIGNIFICANCE. TO OUR

01:52:11.558 --> 01:52:15.128
TO THE HISTORY- THAT A YOU KNOW

01:52:15.195 --> 01:52:17.397
GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE DO NEED

01:52:17.464 --> 01:52:19.032

01:52:30.944 --> 01:52:31.511
COMFORTABLE WITH ALL THE

01:52:31.578 --> 01:52:33.513
LANGUAGE IN THE INTENT. OF THE

01:52:33.580 --> 01:52:34.981
BILL AND ALSO I'M CERTAINLY

01:52:35.048 --> 01:52:36.282
CONCERNED ABOUT THE LACK OF

01:52:36.349 --> 01:52:37.750

OUT OF AFTER THE SENATE FLOOR

01:52:43.223 --> 01:52:45.158

01:52:45.225 --> 01:52:46.226
BE RESOLVED WE CAN GET SOME

01:52:46.292 --> 01:52:47.527
CLARITY FROM THE OTHERS OFFICE

01:52:47.594 --> 01:52:49.329
SOME MORE DIALOGUE BETWEEN OUR

01:52:56.669 --> 01:52:58.872
THOUGHTS. ON ON THIS BILL THEY

01:52:58.938 --> 01:53:00.540
RE AND ANNA AND I AND I DO WANT

01:57:51.964 --> 01:57:54.534
CAPITAL IS ALWAYS UNIQUE AND

01:57:54.600 --> 01:57:55.768
THE CAPITOL GROUNDS AND THAT'S

01:57:55.835 --> 01:57:57.203
WHY WE'RE CONSIDERING THIS I

01:57:57.270 --> 01:57:58.204
WAS GOING TO MENTION IN MY

01:57:58.271 --> 01:58:00.506
CLOTHES SO ONE OF THE FIVE THIS

01:58:00.573 --> 01:58:03.075
IS DIFFERENT MAN PORTRAITS OF

01:58:03.142 --> 01:58:04.844
GOVERNORS OR EVEN A FAN OF THE

01:58:04.911 --> 01:58:06.646
CARMEL MISSION. BECAUSE THIS

01:58:06.712 --> 01:58:09.015
WAS ENACTED BY LAW AND ALL THIS

01:58:09.081 --> 01:58:11.617
DOES IS FOR THE FIRST HALF OF

01:58:11.684 --> 01:58:14.287
THIS ALL IT DOES IS JUST REPEAL

01:58:14.353 --> 01:58:16.589
THE REQUIREMENT THAT THERE BE A

01:58:16.656 --> 01:58:18.090
STATUTE THERE'S NO REQUIREMENTS

01:58:18.157 --> 01:58:19.158
ABOUT THOSE GOVERNORS

01:58:19.225 --> 01:58:22.995
PORTRAITS. OF THE CARMEL STATUE

01:58:23.062 --> 01:58:25.531
IS ON PRIVATE LAND OUTSIDE OF

01:58:25.598 --> 01:58:27.733
THE GOVERNMENT CONTROL SO IT

01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:29.535
WOULD BE NOT WITHIN I THINK THE

01:58:29.602 --> 01:58:31.037
PURVIEW OF THAT COMMISSION AND

01:58:31.103 --> 01:58:33.306
HOW THEY'RE STRUCTURED IS THERE

01:58:33.372 --> 01:58:34.574
ANOTHER BODY WITHIN THE STATE

01:58:34.640 --> 01:58:36.075
OF CALIFORNIA THAT IS

01:58:36.142 --> 01:58:39.445
APPROPRIATE TO REVIEW A MATTER

01:58:39.512 --> 01:58:40.480
LIKE THIS IN CURA MEMBER OF

01:58:40.546 --> 01:58:43.082
STAFF ONE BODY. BECAUSE BECAUSE

01:58:43.149 --> 01:58:44.817
IT WAS THE LEGISLATURE THAT

01:58:44.884 --> 01:58:48.387
REQUIRED THE STATUE BY LAW IT

01:58:48.454 --> 01:58:49.889
IS THE LEGISLATURE THAT CAN

01:58:49.956 --> 01:58:51.290
DEAL WITH IT AND IT'S A

01:58:51.357 --> 01:58:53.426
LEGISLATURE THAT THAT SORT OF

01:58:53.493 --> 01:58:55.027
HAS CONTROL OVER THE CAPITOL

01:58:55.094 --> 01:58:56.529
GROUNDS OKAY BUT THENOUTSIDE

01:58:56.596 --> 01:58:58.598
OF. THE LEGISLATURE THERE'S NO

01:58:58.664 --> 01:59:00.933
OTHER NOT DIRECT MISSION TO MY

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.002
KNOWLEDGE TO MY KNOWLEDGE AND

01:59:03.069 --> 01:59:04.003

01:59:04.070 --> 01:59:05.371
TO GET MY UNDERSTANDS THAT

01:59:05.438 --> 01:59:07.340

KNOW- BECAUSE OUR HISTORY ISN'T

02:00:30.823 --> 02:00:34.794
PERFECT. BUT IT'S OURS. AND

02:00:34.860 --> 02:00:36.896
ERASING IT AND SIMPLY ERASING

02:00:36.963 --> 02:00:39.699
IT DOESN'T MAKE IT GO AWAY. AT

02:00:39.765 --> 02:00:42.168
ALL AND I THINK M. RECOGNIZING

02:00:42.234 --> 02:00:43.402
WHAT OUR HISTORY IS IN THE

02:00:43.469 --> 02:00:45.538

02:00:45.605 --> 02:00:47.440
OUR YOUNG PEOPLE UNDERSTAND-

02:00:47.506 --> 02:00:48.774
NOT TO MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES

02:00:48.841 --> 02:00:51.210
IN THE PAST. SO EVEN THOUGH I

INDIVIDUALS ON OUR CAP IN THESE

02:01:05.758 --> 02:01:07.960
GROUPS. THE INDIVIDUAL JUNIPER

THE NEED AMERICANS ON OUR

ACTUALLY THE QUESTION WAS

02:01:20.039 --> 02:01:23.175
ALREADY OFFERED. A SO LET ME

02:01:23.242 --> 02:01:25.144
SAY ONCE AGAIN MAYBE IN A

02:01:25.211 --> 02:01:28.347
DIFFERENT WAY. THIS BILL JUST

02:01:28.414 --> 02:01:30.316
RECALL PEELS THE REQUIREMENT TO

02:01:30.383 --> 02:01:33.152
ACTUALLY HAVE THE STATUTE.

02:01:33.219 --> 02:01:35.588
LEAVES OPEN A DISCUSSION SUCH

02:01:35.655 --> 02:01:37.523
AS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT EVEN

02:01:37.590 --> 02:01:39.792
THOUGH IT PROACTIVELY SETS UP A

02:01:39.859 --> 02:01:43.095
PROCESS. TO HAVE A STATUTE.

02:01:43.162 --> 02:01:45.531
THAT ARE OWNERS INDIGENOUS

02:01:45.598 --> 02:01:48.434
PEOPLE SO IT LEAVES THAT OPEN

02:01:48.501 --> 02:01:54.707
BUT IT CLEARLY RECALL OF. A

02:01:54.774 --> 02:01:55.141
REPEALS THE ABSOLUTE

02:01:55.207 --> 02:01:55.708
REQUIREMENT THE WE HAVE THE

02:01:55.775 --> 02:01:57.343

YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR

02:02:02.014 --> 02:02:05.785
DEBATE ON THIS ITEM IN NINETEEN

02:02:05.851 --> 02:02:06.585
NINE CENTER ALERT WHICH

02:02:06.652 --> 02:02:09.722
ARTICLES THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT

LET ME THANK ALL THE MEMBERS

02:02:12.124 --> 02:02:12.792
FOR THEIR COMMENTS BECAUSE I

02:02:12.858 --> 02:02:14.794
THINK IT'S A IT'S A REAL

02:02:14.860 --> 02:02:16.395
TRIBUTE TO THE DISCUSSION THAT

02:02:16.462 --> 02:02:17.997
NEEDS O HAPPEN AND IN FACT

02:02:18.064 --> 02:02:20.099
HAPPENED HERE TODAY IN MANY

02:02:20.166 --> 02:02:23.502
WAYS. AND ERR ON THE SUBSTANCE

02:02:23.569 --> 02:02:25.671
OF THE BILL I JUST REPEAT ORDER

02:02:25.738 --> 02:02:27.807
I HAVE SAID TO TWO QUESTIONS

02:02:27.873 --> 02:02:28.874
THE BILL REPEALS THE

02:02:28.941 --> 02:02:31.510
REQUIREMENT FOR THE STATUE AND

02:02:31.577 --> 02:02:33.979
SETS UP A PROCESS FOR A STATUE

02:02:34.046 --> 02:02:35.748
OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLE AND I

02:02:35.815 --> 02:02:38.918
THINK THAT THE TOUGH THING. IS

02:02:38.984 --> 02:02:41.120
SOME OF THE FACTS ABOUT HISTORY

02:02:41.187 --> 02:02:45.458
ARE IN DISPUTE- THE FATHER SIR

02:02:45.524 --> 02:02:46.992
WAS CRITICIZED BY SPANISH

02:02:47.059 --> 02:02:48.828
GOVERNORS AND OTHER EUROPEAN

02:02:48.894 --> 02:02:51.363
OBSERVERS AT THE TIME AND THERE

02:02:51.430 --> 02:02:53.499
IS A BOOK BY THE PULITZER

02:02:53.566 --> 02:02:55.434
NOMINATED AUTHOR AFFILIATE

02:02:55.501 --> 02:02:57.503
DISCUSS DO THAT REALLY

02:02:57.570 --> 02:03:00.806
DOCUMENTS THE THINGS THAT THAT

02:03:00.873 --> 02:03:03.709
WERE RAISED ABOUT THIS. SUBJECT

02:03:03.776 --> 02:03:05.878
AND IT IT ALSO IN THE

02:03:05.945 --> 02:03:07.413
DIFFICULTY OF THE DISCUSSION I

02:03:07.480 --> 02:03:08.981
MEAN POPE FRANCIS CAME TO SOUTH

02:03:09.048 --> 02:03:12.184
AMERICA AND APOLOGIZED TO

02:03:12.251 --> 02:03:13.486
INDIGENOUS PEOPLES FOR THE

02:03:13.552 --> 02:03:18.090
GRAVE SINS OF COLONIALISM. AND

02:03:18.157 --> 02:03:19.959
SO I THINK THAT IT WAS ALSO

02:03:20.025 --> 02:03:22.862
OFFERED ON THE FLOOR THAT ARE

02:03:22.928 --> 02:03:25.664
MONUMENTS AND OUR CAPITAL NEEDS

02:03:25.731 --> 02:03:26.966
TO BE REPRESENTED

02:03:27.032 --> 02:03:28.701
REPRESENTATIVE OF MANY

02:03:28.768 --> 02:03:30.703
DIFFERENT GROUPS THAT HAVE BEEN

02:03:30.770 --> 02:03:32.438
INSTRUMENTAL IN CALIFORNIA'S

02:03:32.505 --> 02:03:34.240
HISTORY. I THINK WHAT IS

02:03:34.306 --> 02:03:35.775
HAPPENING HERE IS A CLEAR

02:03:35.841 --> 02:03:38.010
STATEMENT. THAT THAT HASN'T

02:03:38.077 --> 02:03:39.945
HAPPENED AND THAT ALL OF US

02:03:40.012 --> 02:03:41.614
HAVE TO TAKE IT UPON HERSELF TO

02:03:41.680 --> 02:03:43.282
CONTINUE THAT PROCESS TO MAKE

02:03:43.349 --> 02:03:45.284
SURE IT HAPPENS AND THEN I

02:03:45.351 --> 02:03:46.585
THINK THAT WAS SET ON THE FLOOR

02:03:46.652 --> 02:03:50.623
NOT. A GOOD THING SO- THE ONE

02:03:50.689 --> 02:03:52.458
LAST THING I'D SAY IS IT'S

02:03:52.525 --> 02:03:53.959
INTERESTING IF YOU LOOK AT THE

02:03:54.026 --> 02:03:56.128
SUPPORT AND THE OPPOSITION. THE

02:03:56.195 --> 02:03:59.665
SUPPORT IT IS REALLY FIFTEEN

02:03:59.732 --> 02:04:01.801
TRIBES WERE REPRESENTATIVES OF

02:04:01.867 --> 02:04:04.103
TRIBAL ORGANIZATIONS AND IT IS

02:04:04.170 --> 02:04:06.172
THEIR VOICE THAT'S SPEAKING TO

02:04:06.238 --> 02:04:08.774
WHAT THEIR VIEW OF HISTORY YES

02:04:08.841 --> 02:04:10.743
AND IT IS IMPORTANT. TO HEAR

02:04:10.810 --> 02:04:13.312
THAT FORCE BECAUSE THE STRUGGLE

02:04:13.379 --> 02:04:15.414
