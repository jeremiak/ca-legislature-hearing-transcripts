01:00:53.383 --> 01:00:55.418 region:rollup2
TIES.

01:00:54.351 --> 01:00:56.686 region:rollup2
AND ROCK OUR FAVORITE PAIR OF

01:00:55.418 --> 01:00:58.155 region:rollup2
JEANS

01:00:56.686 --> 01:00:59.389 region:rollup2
BUT DEBT OF DAY REPRESENTS SO

01:00:58.155 --> 01:01:00.690 region:rollup2
MUCH MORE THAN SUPPORTING OUR

01:00:59.389 --> 01:01:02.459 region:rollup2
OFFICIAL STATE FABRIC WHILE ON

01:01:00.690 --> 01:01:04.761 region:rollup2
THE JOB.

01:01:02.459 --> 01:01:06.630 region:rollup2
IT'S ROOT CAUSES MUCH MORE

01:01:04.761 --> 01:01:07.931 region:rollup2
SERIOUS AND MUCH MORE TROUBLING.

01:01:06.630 --> 01:01:09.132 region:rollup2
TWENTY YEARS AGO THE ITALIAN

01:01:07.931 --> 01:01:10.400 region:rollup2
SUPREME COURT REVERSED THE

01:01:09.132 --> 01:01:12.335 region:rollup2
CONVICTION OF A MAN WHO RAPED AN

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:13.803 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD WOMAN.

01:01:12.335 --> 01:01:15.238 region:rollup2
THE COURT DETERMINED THAT THE

01:01:13.803 --> 01:01:16.439 region:rollup2
ATTACK MOST OF THE CONSENSUAL

01:01:15.238 --> 01:01:18.041 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE WOMAN WAS WEARING

01:01:16.439 --> 01:01:19.276 region:rollup2
JEANS THAT WERE SO TIGHT THAT

01:01:18.041 --> 01:01:21.178 region:rollup2
THE ONLY WAY TO REMOVE THEM

01:01:19.276 --> 01:01:22.512 region:rollup2
WOULD BE WITH HER HELP.

01:01:21.178 --> 01:01:23.413 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN BELIEVE THAT HER

01:01:22.512 --> 01:01:24.915 region:rollup2
FORTY FIVE YEAR OLD DRIVING

01:01:23.413 --> 01:01:26.383 region:rollup2
INSTRUCTOR.

01:01:24.915 --> 01:01:28.451 region:rollup2
I TAKE HER TO AN ISOLATED ROAD

01:01:26.383 --> 01:01:29.386 region:rollup2
REMOVE HER FROM THE CAR WRESTLE

01:01:28.451 --> 01:01:30.854 region:rollup2
HER OUT OF HER JEANS AND RAPED

01:01:29.386 --> 01:01:32.088 region:rollup2
HER.

01:01:30.854 --> 01:01:34.991 region:rollup2
THE CHIEF JUSTICE EXCUSE THE

01:01:32.088 --> 01:01:36.526 region:rollup2
MAN'S BEHAVIOR BY STATING QUOTE.

01:01:34.991 --> 01:01:38.395 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE VICTIM WERE VERY

01:01:36.526 --> 01:01:40.664 region:rollup2
VERY TIGHT JEANS SHE HAD TO HELP

01:01:38.395 --> 01:01:42.165 region:rollup2
HIM REMOVE THEM AND BY REMOVING

01:01:40.664 --> 01:01:44.935 region:rollup2
THE JEANS IT WAS NO LONGER RAPE.

01:01:42.165 --> 01:01:46.670 region:rollup2
BUT CONSENSUAL SEX.

01:01:44.935 --> 01:01:48.171 region:rollup2
RIGHTFULLY ENRAGED BY THE CORD

01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:49.739 region:rollup2
WOMEN OF THE ITALIAN PARLIAMENT

01:01:48.171 --> 01:01:50.840 region:rollup2
SHOWED UP FOR WORK WEARING JEANS

01:01:49.739 --> 01:01:53.310 region:rollup2
TO PROTEST THIS.

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:54.444 region:rollup2
SERB RULING.

01:01:53.310 --> 01:01:55.712 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT WE STILL HAVE A

01:01:54.444 --> 01:01:56.947 region:rollup2
PROBLEM WITH SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN

01:01:55.712 --> 01:01:57.480 region:rollup2
THIS COUNTRY DEMONSTRATE FOR

THIS TYPE OF RESOLUTION IS

01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:02.285 region:rollup2
STILL.

01:01:59.416 --> 01:02:03.587 region:rollup2
SO IMPORTANT TWENTY YEARS LATER.

01:02:02.285 --> 01:02:04.988 region:rollup2
I RECENTLY RECEIVED A LETTER

01:02:03.587 --> 01:02:06.523 region:rollup2
FROM ONE OF MY CONSTITUENTS WHO

01:02:04.988 --> 01:02:08.491 region:rollup2
RECOUNTED HER EXPERIENCE OF

01:02:06.523 --> 01:02:10.260 region:rollup2
BEING SEXUALLY ASSAULTED.

01:02:08.491 --> 01:02:11.962 region:rollup2
SHE USED THOSE EXPERIENCE TO

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:13.029 region:rollup2
FUEL HER OWN PASSION.

01:02:11.962 --> 01:02:13.863 region:rollup2
AND HER DESIRE TO HELP OTHER

01:02:13.029 --> 01:02:15.031 region:rollup2
PEOPLE SPEAK WITH THEIR OWN

01:02:13.863 --> 01:02:17.067 region:rollup2
VOICES.

01:02:15.031 --> 01:02:19.002 region:rollup2
SHE WROTE TO ME.

01:02:17.067 --> 01:02:19.636 region:rollup2
ONCE MY VOICE WAS FOUND I WANTED

01:02:19.002 --> 01:02:21.871 region:rollup2
EVERYONE TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY

01:02:19.636 --> 01:02:23.206 region:rollup2

01:02:21.871 --> 01:02:24.441 region:rollup2
AS LEADERS IN THE STATE WE ARE

01:02:23.206 --> 01:02:25.675 region:rollup2

01:02:25.675 --> 01:02:29.112 region:rollup2
FOR THEMSELVES.

01:02:27.377 --> 01:02:30.714 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO RAISE OUR

01:02:29.112 --> 01:02:32.882 region:rollup2

01:02:30.714 --> 01:02:33.917 region:rollup2
SURROUNDS SEXUAL VIOLENCE.

01:02:32.882 --> 01:02:35.251 region:rollup2

01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:45.028 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT JUST A WOMEN'S

01:02:43.126 --> 01:02:46.496 region:rollup2

MINOR FROM GOING TO THE DOCTOR

01:12:21.137 --> 01:12:24.774 region:rollup2
WE DON'T WANT THAT. BUT MY READ

01:12:22.805 --> 01:12:27.043 region:rollup2
OF YOUR BILL JUST THE TEXT OF

01:12:24.774 --> 01:12:28.878 region:rollup2
THE BILL IS THAT IT. ONLY ALLOWS

01:12:27.043 --> 01:12:30.112 region:rollup2
THE PARENTS TO BE NOTIFIED IF

01:12:28.878 --> 01:12:31.514 region:rollup2
THE PHYSICIAN SUSPECTS CHILD

01:12:30.112 --> 01:12:33.216 region:rollup2
ABUSE.

01:12:31.514 --> 01:12:34.250 region:rollup2
AND I THINK AS THE BILL GOES

01:12:33.216 --> 01:12:35.851 region:rollup2
OVER TO THE SENATE WHICH I HOPE

01:12:34.250 --> 01:12:36.953 region:rollup2

THE BILL TODAY IT'S GONNA BE

01:12:36.953 --> 01:12:39.855 region:rollup2
REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE WE

01:12:38.487 --> 01:12:42.325 region:rollup2
GET CLEAR ON THAT. BECAUSE THEY

01:12:39.855 --> 01:12:42.925 region:rollup2
DO SEE A POTENTIAL INCONSISTENCY

01:12:42.325 --> 01:12:43.860 region:rollup2
IN THE LANGUAGE AND WE WANT TO

01:12:42.925 --> 01:12:45.294 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT.

01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:48.097 region:rollup2
PARENTAL NOTIFICATION IF THE

01:12:45.294 --> 01:12:50.099 region:rollup2
PARENTS IS NOT THE ABUSER.

01:12:48.097 --> 01:12:51.734 region:rollup2
I CAN STILL HAPPEN AND AND THE

01:12:50.099 --> 01:12:53.536 region:rollup2
PARENTS CAN STILL THEN TAKE

01:12:51.734 --> 01:12:54.136 region:rollup2

01:12:53.536 --> 01:12:56.339 region:rollup2

ENFORCEMENT.

01:13:16.659 --> 01:13:19.428 region:rollup2
THE AUTHOR STATEMENT SAYS THAT

01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:20.963 region:rollup2
THIS BILL WILL REMOVE THE

01:13:19.428 --> 01:13:22.598 region:rollup2
BARRIERS FOR MINERS WHO HAVE

01:13:20.963 --> 01:13:24.033 region:rollup2
BEEN ASSAULTED.

01:13:22.598 --> 01:13:26.269 region:rollup2
IT SHOULD FURTHER GO ON TO SAY

01:13:24.033 --> 01:13:27.036 region:rollup2
IT REMOVES THE PARENTS.

01:13:26.269 --> 01:13:29.405 region:rollup2
FROM THEIR RESPONSIBILITY WITH

01:13:27.036 --> 01:13:32.208 region:rollup2
THEIR CHILD.

01:13:29.405 --> 01:13:33.943 region:rollup2
IMAGINE IF YOU HAVE A CHILD

01:13:32.208 --> 01:13:35.244 region:rollup2
LET'S SAY THERE'S A CHILD A GIRL

01:13:33.943 --> 01:13:37.446 region:rollup2
YOUNG GIRL SHE'S THIRTEEN

01:13:35.244 --> 01:13:39.482 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN WHATEVER.

01:13:37.446 --> 01:13:41.250 region:rollup2
SHE HAS A BOYFRIEND.

01:13:39.482 --> 01:13:41.817 region:rollup2
AND THE PARENTS DON'T LIKE HIM.

01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:43.886 region:rollup2
AND THEY TOLD HER NOT TO SEE

01:13:41.817 --> 01:13:46.989 region:rollup2
HIM.

01:13:43.886 --> 01:13:49.358 region:rollup2
SHE DOES ANYWAY AS TEENAGERS DO.

01:13:46.989 --> 01:13:50.293 region:rollup2
AND THEN SHE'S ASSAULTED.

01:13:49.358 --> 01:13:52.228 region:rollup2
THEN SHE FEELS LIKE SHE CAN'T GO

01:13:50.293 --> 01:13:52.828 region:rollup2
TELL HER PARENTS

01:13:52.228 --> 01:13:54.030 region:rollup2
BECAUSE HE'S GOING TO GET MORE

01:13:52.828 --> 01:13:55.064 region:rollup2
TROUBLE.

01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:57.233 region:rollup2
BECAUSE SHE WASN'T SUPPOSED TO

01:13:55.064 --> 01:13:57.833 region:rollup2
SEE HIM ANYWAY AND OH BY THE WAY

01:13:57.233 --> 01:13:59.568 region:rollup2
OUR PARENTS DIDN'T LIKE HIM IN

01:13:57.833 --> 01:14:01.037 region:rollup2
THE FIRST PLACE.

01:13:59.568 --> 01:14:02.605 region:rollup2
SO WITH THAT THE POINT IN TIME

01:14:01.037 --> 01:14:04.206 region:rollup2
WHERE WE'RE GOING TO REMOVE THE

01:14:02.605 --> 01:14:05.975 region:rollup2
PARENTS FROM THE EQUATION REMOVE

01:14:04.206 --> 01:14:08.110 region:rollup2
THEM FROM THEIR CHILD'S LIFE AT

01:14:05.975 --> 01:14:09.812 region:rollup2
A TIME WHEN THAT CHILD IS GOING

01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:13.416 region:rollup2
TO NEED HER MOTHER OR FATHER AT

01:14:09.812 --> 01:14:14.750 region:rollup2
THE MOST.

01:14:13.416 --> 01:14:16.452 region:rollup2
THAT IS VERY THAT'S A VERY

01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:18.688 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT STEP IN THIS PROCESS

01:14:16.452 --> 01:14:20.222 region:rollup2
OF HEALING FOR A CHILD WHO HAS

01:14:18.688 --> 01:14:21.424 region:rollup2
BEEN ASSAULTED. THEY'RE YOUNG

01:14:20.222 --> 01:14:22.992 region:rollup2
THEY ARE VULNERABLE THEY'RE NOT

01:14:21.424 --> 01:14:24.360 region:rollup2
MATURE ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND ALL

01:14:22.992 --> 01:14:25.995 region:rollup2
OF THE THOUGHTS THEY'RE HAVING A

01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:27.496 region:rollup2
WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THEM AND

01:14:25.995 --> 01:14:29.465 region:rollup2
THE LAST THING I THINK WE WANT

01:14:27.496 --> 01:14:32.301 region:rollup2
TO DO. IS TO TELL THEM.

01:14:29.465 --> 01:14:34.270 region:rollup2
GO TO STRANGERS IN THE MEDICAL

01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:37.907 region:rollup2
PROFESSION AND HAVE THEM HELP

01:14:34.270 --> 01:14:39.108 region:rollup2
YOU AND LATER ON AFTER THE FACT.

01:14:37.907 --> 01:14:41.177 region:rollup2
THEN YOU CAN YOU MAY TELL THE

01:14:39.108 --> 01:14:42.611 region:rollup2
PARENTS.

01:14:41.177 --> 01:14:44.380 region:rollup2
EVERY GOING TO ALLOW THE PARENTS

01:14:42.611 --> 01:14:45.047 region:rollup2
TO BE NOTIFIED.

01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:47.750 region:rollup2
WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE AFTER THE

01:14:45.047 --> 01:14:49.452 region:rollup2
FACT?

01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:51.220 region:rollup2
WHY WOULDN'T IT BE BEFORE WHY

01:14:49.452 --> 01:14:53.889 region:rollup2
ARE WE REMOVING PARENTS?

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:55.424 region:rollup2
FROM THEIR CHILD'S LIVES.

01:14:53.889 --> 01:14:57.426 region:rollup2
THIS IS UNCONSCIONABLE AND I

01:14:55.424 --> 01:14:59.161 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND I'M SURE THAT THAT

01:14:57.426 --> 01:15:01.464 region:rollup2
THE MOTIVE IS GENUINE AND

01:14:59.161 --> 01:15:03.366 region:rollup2
SINCERE. BUT I THINK THIS IS BAD

01:15:01.464 --> 01:15:04.900 region:rollup2
PUBLIC POLICY AND I THINK WE

01:15:03.366 --> 01:15:06.402 region:rollup2
OUGHT NOT BE INTERVENING AND

01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:08.070 region:rollup2
SEPARATING PARENTS FROM THEIR

CHILDREN AT A TIME WHEN THAT

01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:11.340 region:rollup2
CHILD PROBABLY NEEDS THEIR

01:15:09.238 --> 01:15:12.608 region:rollup2
