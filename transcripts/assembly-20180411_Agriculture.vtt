THERE ARE FEW THINGS

00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:16.375 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY THAT YOUR STAFF

ASKED ME TO TOUCH ON.

00:26:16.375 --> 00:26:19.478 region:rollup2
BUT I'M ALWAYS HAPPY TO DO

00:26:17.075 --> 00:26:22.047 region:rollup2
BECAUSE CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE

00:26:19.478 --> 00:26:23.048 region:rollup2
FOR ME IS SUCH. A TREASURE FOR

00:26:22.047 --> 00:26:24.082 region:rollup2
THE STATE FOR THIS NATION THAT

00:26:23.048 --> 00:26:25.717 region:rollup2
IT'S IMPORTANT TO START WITH THE

00:26:24.082 --> 00:26:28.020 region:rollup2
NUMBERS AND THE NUMBERS ARE

00:26:25.717 --> 00:26:30.889 region:rollup2
PRETTY IMPRESSIVE FOR AS LONG AS

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:31.924 region:rollup2
USDA HAS BEEN KEEPING RECORDS OF

00:26:30.889 --> 00:26:33.258 region:rollup2
WHAT THE FARM GATE VALUE IS OF

00:26:31.924 --> 00:26:37.729 region:rollup2
AGRICULTURE. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN

00:26:33.258 --> 00:26:38.964 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER ONE STATE FOR OVER

00:26:37.729 --> 00:26:40.532 region:rollup2
SIXTY PLUS YEARS.

00:26:38.964 --> 00:26:41.400 region:rollup2
WE DO THAT WERE A LARGE STATE

00:26:40.532 --> 00:26:43.368 region:rollup2
BUT WE ALSO DO THAT IS THE STATE

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:44.903 region:rollup2
THAT ALSO HAS FORTY MILLION

00:26:43.368 --> 00:26:46.271 region:rollup2
RESIDENTS WHO ARE HIGHLY URBAN

00:26:44.903 --> 00:26:46.738 region:rollup2
MY STATES THAT HAVE THIS KIND OF

00:26:46.271 --> 00:26:47.039 region:rollup2
PRODUCTIVITY IS PRETTY

00:26:46.738 --> 00:26:47.940 region:rollup2
REMARKABLE.

00:26:47.039 --> 00:26:48.907 region:rollup2
THE MOST RECENT NUMBERS ON THE

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:49.775 region:rollup2
VALUE OF AGRICULTURE HAS JUST A

00:26:48.907 --> 00:26:50.342 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT OVER FORTY FIVE

00:26:49.775 --> 00:26:50.676 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS AT THE FARM

00:26:50.342 --> 00:26:52.411 region:rollup2
GATE.

00:26:50.676 --> 00:26:52.945 region:rollup2
THAT'S WITHOUT ANY VALUE ADDED

00:26:52.411 --> 00:26:54.279 region:rollup2
AND THAT THAT.

00:26:52.945 --> 00:26:55.380 region:rollup2
INCLUDES OVER FOUR HUNDRED

00:26:54.279 --> 00:26:57.249 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT COMMODITIES THAT WE

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:57.749 region:rollup2
GROW HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND OF

00:26:57.249 --> 00:26:58.317 region:rollup2
COURSE THE TRADEMARK OF

00:26:57.749 --> 00:26:59.118 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA ARE OUR SPECIALTY

00:26:58.317 --> 00:27:01.320 region:rollup2
CROPS

00:26:59.118 --> 00:27:03.222 region:rollup2
SPECIALTY CROPS ARE THOSE FRUITS

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:06.191 region:rollup2
VEGETABLES TREE KNOTS OLIVE OILS

00:27:03.222 --> 00:27:07.693 region:rollup2
WINES CRAFT FAIRS. UP ALL THOSE

00:27:06.191 --> 00:27:08.927 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS THAT

00:27:07.693 --> 00:27:10.629 region:rollup2
WE CAN GROW HERE BECAUSE

00:27:08.927 --> 00:27:13.265 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

00:27:10.629 --> 00:27:14.266 region:rollup2
HAS A MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE.

00:27:13.265 --> 00:27:16.034 region:rollup2
THAT MAKES A SPEAR UNIQUE THERE

00:27:14.266 --> 00:27:17.236 region:rollup2
ARE ONLY FIVE OTHER LOCATIONS IN

00:27:16.034 --> 00:27:18.737 region:rollup2
THE WORLD THAT ARE A BLAST

00:27:17.236 --> 00:27:21.206 region:rollup2
WITH THE MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE

00:27:18.737 --> 00:27:24.243 region:rollup2
THAT GIVES US THAT ABILITY.

00:27:21.206 --> 00:27:26.311 region:rollup2
TO PLAY. AND HARVEST A CROP

00:27:24.243 --> 00:27:28.046 region:rollup2
ALMOST EVERYDAY OF THE YEAR

00:27:26.311 --> 00:27:29.515 region:rollup2
SOMEPLACE IN CALIFORNIA.

00:27:28.046 --> 00:27:32.050 region:rollup2
SO WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT IT IS

00:27:29.515 --> 00:27:34.353 region:rollup2
THAT WE PRODUCE ITS OVER HALF OF

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:35.721 region:rollup2
THEM OF THAT NATION'S FRUITS

00:27:34.353 --> 00:27:37.389 region:rollup2
VEGETABLES AND TREE NUTS.

00:27:35.721 --> 00:27:39.625 region:rollup2
WERE THE WORLD'S FOURTH LARGEST

00:27:37.389 --> 00:27:41.326 region:rollup2
WINE PRODUCER WE ARE THAT

00:27:39.625 --> 00:27:43.195 region:rollup2
COUNTRY'S NUMBER ONE MILK

00:27:41.326 --> 00:27:45.564 region:rollup2
PRODUCER.

00:27:43.195 --> 00:27:47.933 region:rollup2
WE HAVE OVER TWENTY CROPS THAT

00:27:45.564 --> 00:27:50.035 region:rollup2
WE PUT WE ARE THE PRODUCER OF

00:27:47.933 --> 00:27:52.037 region:rollup2
OVER NINETY PERCENT. AND THAT'S

00:27:50.035 --> 00:27:54.773 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THE SPECIAL THINGS LIKE

00:27:52.037 --> 00:27:56.141 region:rollup2
ARTICHOKES AND FIGS AND OLIVES

00:27:54.773 --> 00:27:58.310 region:rollup2
THEM WINE GRAPES.

00:27:56.141 --> 00:28:00.812 region:rollup2
WE ALSO IN ADDITION TO BEING

00:27:58.310 --> 00:28:02.214 region:rollup2
ABLE TO BE THE SOURCE OF HEALTHY

00:28:00.812 --> 00:28:03.782 region:rollup2
NUTRITIOUS FOOD FOR OUR CITIZENS

00:28:02.214 --> 00:28:05.984 region:rollup2
HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE SHIP THAT

00:28:03.782 --> 00:28:07.653 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE COUNTRY. BUT WE ALSO

00:28:05.984 --> 00:28:09.788 region:rollup2
NOW SHIPPED OVER A HUNDRED AND

00:28:07.653 --> 00:28:11.290 region:rollup2
SIXTY SEVEN DIFFERENT MARKETS ON

00:28:09.788 --> 00:28:13.525 region:rollup2
A GLOBAL BASIS.

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:14.960 region:rollup2
SO WE ARE A POWERHOUSE WE ARE

00:28:13.525 --> 00:28:16.828 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER ONE AGRICULTURAL X.

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:19.698 region:rollup2
EXPORTER.

00:28:16.828 --> 00:28:20.465 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS YOU'RE STAFF

00:28:19.698 --> 00:28:21.733 region:rollup2
WANTED ME TO TALK ABOUT IN

00:28:20.465 --> 00:28:23.368 region:rollup2
ADDITION TO THE IMPORTANCE OF

00:28:21.733 --> 00:28:26.038 region:rollup2
SPECIALTY CROPS.

00:28:23.368 --> 00:28:28.373 region:rollup2
THE FACT IS WE CAN THROW THOSE

00:28:26.038 --> 00:28:30.842 region:rollup2
THINGS HERE. THAT COULD NOT BE

00:28:28.373 --> 00:28:33.011 region:rollup2
EASILY GROWN AND OTHER STATES OR

00:28:30.842 --> 00:28:34.546 region:rollup2
EVEN IN OTHER COUNTRIES AND I

00:28:33.011 --> 00:28:35.747 region:rollup2
THINK THAT'S A FACT THAT BECAME

00:28:34.546 --> 00:28:38.016 region:rollup2
VERY EVIDENT DURING OUR DROUGHT.

00:28:35.747 --> 00:28:38.584 region:rollup2
THERE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT

00:28:38.016 --> 00:28:39.651 region:rollup2
STARTED LOOKING OUT FOR MY

00:28:38.584 --> 00:28:40.686 region:rollup2
DINNER PLATE LOOK LIKE IF WE

00:28:39.651 --> 00:28:42.154 region:rollup2
DIDN'T HAVE CALIFORNIA

00:28:40.686 --> 00:28:43.322 region:rollup2
AGRICULTURE.

00:28:42.154 --> 00:28:45.190 region:rollup2
SO WE CANNOT BE EASILY

00:28:43.322 --> 00:28:46.825 region:rollup2
DUPLICATED BUT THERE ARE SOME

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:47.392 region:rollup2
DRIVING FORCES FOR AGRICULTURE

00:28:46.825 --> 00:28:49.962 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW THAT ARE CHANGING

00:28:47.392 --> 00:28:51.463 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:28:49.962 --> 00:28:53.131 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK

00:28:51.463 --> 00:28:54.600 region:rollup2
IT'S IMPORTANT TO CALL OUT ABOUT

00:28:53.131 --> 00:28:56.201 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE AND THE

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:58.070 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE

00:28:56.201 --> 00:28:59.605 region:rollup2
IS THAT OVER NINETY FIVE PERCENT

00:28:58.070 --> 00:29:02.374 region:rollup2
OF THE FARMS IN THE STATE OUR

00:28:59.605 --> 00:29:04.076 region:rollup2
FAMILY. FARM OPERATIONS.

00:29:02.374 --> 00:29:06.345 region:rollup2
AND EVEN OF THAT REMAINING FIVE

00:29:04.076 --> 00:29:08.280 region:rollup2
PERCENT. MANY OF THOSE ARE

00:29:06.345 --> 00:29:10.148 region:rollup2
FAMILY CORPORATIONS OR THEY'RE

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:11.850 region:rollup2
HELD IN TRUST

00:29:10.148 --> 00:29:13.652 region:rollup2
OR BY A STATE SO YOU HAVE THE

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:14.753 region:rollup2
MISCONCEPTION ABOUT CALIFORNIA

00:29:13.652 --> 00:29:16.888 region:rollup2
AGRICULTURE THAT THOSE SEVENTY

00:29:14.753 --> 00:29:18.023 region:rollup2
SEVEN THOUSAND FARMS ARE ALL ONE

00:29:16.888 --> 00:29:20.092 region:rollup2
SIZE THEY'RE NOT.

00:29:18.023 --> 00:29:20.592 region:rollup2
IF THE DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

00:29:20.092 --> 00:29:21.793 region:rollup2
AGRICULTURE THAT IS OUR

00:29:20.592 --> 00:29:23.328 region:rollup2
STRENGTH.

00:29:21.793 --> 00:29:25.597 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE MANY NEW BEGINNING

00:29:23.328 --> 00:29:26.665 region:rollup2
FARMERS FOR DOING VERY SMALL A

00:29:25.597 --> 00:29:29.067 region:rollup2
CREATES ON THE EDGE OF BIG URBAN

00:29:26.665 --> 00:29:30.936 region:rollup2
CENTERS WERE VERY FOCUSED ON

00:29:29.067 --> 00:29:33.038 region:rollup2
DIRECT TO CONSUMER MARKETS. AND

00:29:30.936 --> 00:29:34.973 region:rollup2
THEN WE HAVE LARGE SCALE MULTI

00:29:33.038 --> 00:29:36.341 region:rollup2
GENERATION FAMILY FARMS. WHO

00:29:34.973 --> 00:29:37.776 region:rollup2
THEY ARE VERY FOCUSED ON BEING

00:29:36.341 --> 00:29:39.511 region:rollup2
AND IF THE MOST EFFICIENT

00:29:37.776 --> 00:29:41.079 region:rollup2
PRODUCER TO SHIP THEIR PRODUCTS

00:29:39.511 --> 00:29:43.315 region:rollup2
AROUND THE GLOBE? AND I THINK

00:29:41.079 --> 00:29:44.950 region:rollup2
THAT'S OUR STRENGTH BUT HOW DO

00:29:43.315 --> 00:29:46.451 region:rollup2
WE IMPROVE THE RESILIENCE OF

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:48.186 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE. WHEN WE

00:29:46.451 --> 00:29:50.622 region:rollup2
LOOK AT WHAT THE DRIVERS ARE FOR

00:29:48.186 --> 00:29:52.724 region:rollup2
TRANS TODAY THAT WILL MAKE BIG

00:29:50.622 --> 00:29:54.793 region:rollup2
IMPACTS AND CHANGE ON

00:29:52.724 --> 00:29:55.961 region:rollup2
AGRICULTURE GOING FORWARD.

00:29:54.793 --> 00:29:57.396 region:rollup2
THERE'S A COUPLE MAJOR THINGS

00:29:55.961 --> 00:29:59.464 region:rollup2
ONE IS WATER. YOU CANNOT HAVE A

00:29:57.396 --> 00:30:01.233 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION WITH ANYONE IN

00:29:59.464 --> 00:30:01.967 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE WITHOUT

00:30:01.233 --> 00:30:05.537 region:rollup2
ACKNOWLEDGING.

00:30:01.967 --> 00:30:07.706 region:rollup2
THE.

00:30:05.537 --> 00:30:09.775 region:rollup2
IMPACT OF WATER AND THAT

00:30:07.706 --> 00:30:11.410 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTE NEED FOR MORE CERTAINTY

00:30:09.775 --> 00:30:12.911 region:rollup2
IN OUR WATER SUPPLY. THAT

00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:14.179 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT THIS LEGISLATURE

00:30:12.911 --> 00:30:15.480 region:rollup2
HAS DEALT WITH FOR THE SEVEN

00:30:14.179 --> 00:30:16.481 region:rollup2
YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN HERE AND

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:18.617 region:rollup2
THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT THAT

00:30:16.481 --> 00:30:20.152 region:rollup2
THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE. AS WE

00:30:18.617 --> 00:30:21.219 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE DEMANDS ON

00:30:20.152 --> 00:30:22.888 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE AND A

00:30:21.219 --> 00:30:24.322 region:rollup2
WORLD THAT'S GROWING FROM SEVEN

00:30:22.888 --> 00:30:26.491 region:rollup2
BILLION PEOPLE TO NINE BILLION

00:30:24.322 --> 00:30:28.460 region:rollup2
PEOPLE. AND THE ABSOLUTE NEED

00:30:26.491 --> 00:30:29.695 region:rollup2
FOR FOOD SECURITY WILL REQUIRE

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:30.796 region:rollup2
US TO MORE THAN DOUBLE

00:30:29.695 --> 00:30:32.998 region:rollup2
PRODUCTIVITY IN AMERICAN

00:30:30.796 --> 00:30:33.465 region:rollup2
AGRICULTURE AND OTHER KINDS OF

00:30:32.998 --> 00:30:35.467 region:rollup2
CROPS WE GROW HERE IN

00:30:33.465 --> 00:30:36.234 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

00:30:35.467 --> 00:30:38.236 region:rollup2
AT THE TIME THAT WE'RE DOING

00:30:36.234 --> 00:30:40.238 region:rollup2
THAT. IT'S GOING TO BE WITH THE

00:30:38.236 --> 00:30:42.374 region:rollup2
SAME OR SMALLER ENVIRONMENTAL

00:30:40.238 --> 00:30:44.076 region:rollup2
FOOTPRINT THERE WILL BE LESS

00:30:42.374 --> 00:30:45.210 region:rollup2
ARABLE LAND ON A GLOBAL BASIS

00:30:44.076 --> 00:30:46.678 region:rollup2
AND LESS AVAILABLE WATER TO GROW

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:49.247 region:rollup2
THOSE CROPS.

00:30:46.678 --> 00:30:51.883 region:rollup2
SO WHAT WE DO HERE IN CALIFORNIA

00:30:49.247 --> 00:30:53.485 region:rollup2
WITH INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY.

00:30:51.883 --> 00:30:55.854 region:rollup2
IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO THE

00:30:53.485 --> 00:30:57.656 region:rollup2
SUCCESS OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE

00:30:55.854 --> 00:30:59.091 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS TO WHAT OTHER

00:30:57.656 --> 00:31:00.992 region:rollup2
COUNTRIES CAN LEARN FROM US TO

00:30:59.091 --> 00:31:02.694 region:rollup2
FEED THEIR PEOPLE. AND THAT'S

00:31:00.992 --> 00:31:03.829 region:rollup2
THAT'S AN AREA OF TECHNOLOGY

00:31:02.694 --> 00:31:05.897 region:rollup2
THAT'S DRIVING A LOT OF THE

00:31:03.829 --> 00:31:06.732 region:rollup2
CHANGE THE OTHER AREA THAT I

00:31:05.897 --> 00:31:08.500 region:rollup2
KNOW YOU'VE ALSO HEARD A LOT

00:31:06.732 --> 00:31:10.769 region:rollup2
ABOUT. IS JUST THE INCREASING

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:12.037 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES OF HAVING A STABLE

00:31:10.769 --> 00:31:13.739 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE FOR CALIFORNIA

00:31:12.037 --> 00:31:15.040 region:rollup2
AGRICULTURE.

00:31:13.739 --> 00:31:16.074 region:rollup2
THAT'S ALSO DRIVING THE

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.275 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT WITH THE UNIVERSITY

00:31:16.074 --> 00:31:19.077 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIA AND I KNOW YOU'LL

00:31:17.275 --> 00:31:21.646 region:rollup2
BE HEARING FROM CUENTA ABOUT

00:31:19.077 --> 00:31:23.448 region:rollup2
THAT. ON WHERE WHERE CAN WE

00:31:21.646 --> 00:31:25.083 region:rollup2
AUTOMATE MARK WHAT HAS ALREADY

00:31:23.448 --> 00:31:26.752 region:rollup2
BEEN AUTOMATED HOW DO WE PERFECT

00:31:25.083 --> 00:31:28.487 region:rollup2
THAT HOW DO WE MAKE THAT MORE

00:31:26.752 --> 00:31:30.188 region:rollup2
PRECISE WHICH WILL HELP US BE

00:31:28.487 --> 00:31:32.057 region:rollup2
MORE EFFICIENT. BUT ALSO ONE OF

00:31:30.188 --> 00:31:34.092 region:rollup2
THOSE TASKS THAT EVEN A DECADE

00:31:32.057 --> 00:31:35.994 region:rollup2
AGO WE MIGHT NOT HAVE EVEN

00:31:34.092 --> 00:31:38.597 region:rollup2
ENVISIONED COULD BE AUTOMATED IT

00:31:35.994 --> 00:31:40.399 region:rollup2
ANYWAY. AND THAT'S WHERE THE

00:31:38.597 --> 00:31:41.867 region:rollup2
REAL CHANGE IS COMING AND I

00:31:40.399 --> 00:31:43.635 region:rollup2
WOULD SUGGEST THAT IF THERE WERE

00:31:41.867 --> 00:31:45.404 region:rollup2
EVER GOING TO BE THOSE

00:31:43.635 --> 00:31:47.639 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES FOR ADDITIONAL

00:31:45.404 --> 00:31:49.608 region:rollup2
FUNDING FOR. RESEARCH AND THE

00:31:47.639 --> 00:31:52.077 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT OF COMMERCIALLY

00:31:49.608 --> 00:31:54.746 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGY

00:31:52.077 --> 00:31:57.516 region:rollup2
IT WOULD BE AROUND HOW DO WE

00:31:54.746 --> 00:31:59.317 region:rollup2
BRING AUTOMATION. TO THE FARM AS

00:31:57.516 --> 00:32:01.820 region:rollup2
THAT HAS COME INTO OUR PACKING

00:31:59.317 --> 00:32:03.789 region:rollup2
HOUSES AS A HUGE NEED AND THAT

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:04.790 region:rollup2
WILL DRIVE. CHANGE ON CALIFORNIA

00:32:03.789 --> 00:32:05.357 region:rollup2
AGRICULTURE TODAY AND IT WILL

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:07.626 region:rollup2
FOR THE NEXT FEW DECADES TO

00:32:05.357 --> 00:32:08.860 region:rollup2
COME.

00:32:07.626 --> 00:32:10.428 region:rollup2
I WOULD ALSO SAY WHEN WE LOOK AT

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:11.963 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:32:10.428 --> 00:32:14.266 region:rollup2
IT'S BECAUSE THERE ARE NOT AS

00:32:11.963 --> 00:32:16.435 region:rollup2
MANY PEOPLE THAT ARE WILLING TO

00:32:14.266 --> 00:32:18.470 region:rollup2
DO THOSE KINDS OF JOBS THAT

00:32:16.435 --> 00:32:20.438 region:rollup2
REQUIRE MANUAL LABOR. BUT THAT

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:21.873 region:rollup2
DOES NOT ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR

00:32:20.438 --> 00:32:22.974 region:rollup2
MANUAL LABOR A LOT OF OUR

00:32:21.873 --> 00:32:25.610 region:rollup2
SPECIALTY CROPS ARE HIGHLY

00:32:22.974 --> 00:32:27.579 region:rollup2
PERISHABLE A LOT OF CARE IS

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:28.647 region:rollup2
REQUIRED FOR THAT. SO THERE'S

00:32:27.579 --> 00:32:31.082 region:rollup2
SEVERAL THINGS WE HAVE TO LOOK

00:32:28.647 --> 00:32:32.884 region:rollup2
AT AT OTHER WAYS OF MAKING SURE

00:32:31.082 --> 00:32:35.153 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A STABLE WORKFORCE ONE

00:32:32.884 --> 00:32:37.122 region:rollup2
IS HOW CAN WE HELP BRING

00:32:35.153 --> 00:32:38.590 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL CERTIFICATION SO

00:32:37.122 --> 00:32:40.325 region:rollup2
PEOPLE HAVE CAREER LADDERS.

00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:42.828 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S AROUND FOOD SAFETY

00:32:40.325 --> 00:32:45.130 region:rollup2
IRRIGATION SPECIALIZATION PASSED

00:32:42.828 --> 00:32:45.697 region:rollup2
US PESTICIDE APPLICATIONS AN

00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:47.165 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE PASS MANAGEMENT

00:32:45.697 --> 00:32:49.134 region:rollup2
WAYS.

00:32:47.165 --> 00:32:51.870 region:rollup2
BUT THE IMPORTANCE OF VOCATIONAL

00:32:49.134 --> 00:32:54.773 region:rollup2
EDUCATION AND CAREER TECHNICAL

00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:57.008 region:rollup2
EDUCATION WEATHER IS FOR MANUAL

00:32:54.773 --> 00:32:58.476 region:rollup2
LABOR JOBS OR ALL THOSE JOBS

00:32:57.008 --> 00:33:00.846 region:rollup2
THAT ARE BEING CREATED BECAUSE

00:32:58.476 --> 00:33:02.314 region:rollup2
OF TECHNOLOGY AND AUTOMATION.

00:33:00.846 --> 00:33:04.216 region:rollup2
THAT WE DO NEED PEOPLE TO BE THE

00:33:02.314 --> 00:33:05.650 region:rollup2
PROGRAMMERS WE DO NEED PEOPLE

00:33:04.216 --> 00:33:07.319 region:rollup2
WHO ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:09.154 region:rollup2
REPAIR IT THOSE KINDS OF PIECES

00:33:07.319 --> 00:33:12.257 region:rollup2
OF EQUIPMENT. AND MAKE THE

00:33:09.154 --> 00:33:12.691 region:rollup2
ADAPTATIONS IN THE FIELD AND IN

00:33:12.257 --> 00:33:13.859 region:rollup2
OUR PACKING HOUSES.

00:33:12.691 --> 00:33:15.427 region:rollup2
WE ALSO SEE THAT MOST PARTS OF

00:33:13.859 --> 00:33:16.695 region:rollup2
ANY SIZE HAVE TO HAVE SOME

00:33:15.427 --> 00:33:18.530 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO ARE SPECIALISTS

00:33:16.695 --> 00:33:20.365 region:rollup2
AROUND IRRIGATION PEST

00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:22.467 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT.

00:33:20.365 --> 00:33:23.602 region:rollup2
AND INCREASINGLY BEING INVOLVED

00:33:22.467 --> 00:33:24.836 region:rollup2
WITH OUR ABILITY TO ADAPT TO

00:33:23.602 --> 00:33:26.705 region:rollup2
CLIMATE.

00:33:24.836 --> 00:33:28.573 region:rollup2
AS I WANTED TO CLOSE MY COMMENTS

00:33:26.705 --> 00:33:30.775 region:rollup2
TODAY BY TALKING ABOUT CLIMATE

00:33:28.573 --> 00:33:32.544 region:rollup2
ENTRAPPED RESILIENCY. POPULIST

00:33:30.775 --> 00:33:35.146 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY THIS LEGISLATURE HAS

00:33:32.544 --> 00:33:37.349 region:rollup2
MADE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT.

00:33:35.146 --> 00:33:40.285 region:rollup2
AND OUR ABILITY TO ADAPT TO

00:33:37.349 --> 00:33:42.053 region:rollup2
CLIMATE BUT WE ALSO WITH THE

00:33:40.285 --> 00:33:44.055 region:rollup2
UPDATE OF OUR SCOPING PLAN.

00:33:42.053 --> 00:33:45.290 region:rollup2
WE ALSO HAVE ADOPTED A STRATEGY

00:33:44.055 --> 00:33:46.825 region:rollup2
AROUN NATURAL WORKING

00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:50.428 region:rollup2
LANDSCAPES.

00:33:46.825 --> 00:33:53.465 region:rollup2
WHICH IS A CRITICAL NEW STRATEGY

00:33:50.428 --> 00:33:55.200 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT ABILITY TO MANAGE.

00:33:53.465 --> 00:33:56.735 region:rollup2
AND TO APPLY MANAGEMENT

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:58.637 region:rollup2
PRACTICES ON OUR LAND TO

00:33:56.735 --> 00:34:01.139 region:rollup2
SEQUESTER CARBON GIVES US A

00:33:58.637 --> 00:34:03.808 region:rollup2
CHANCE TO MEDICATE IT'S THE ONLY

00:34:01.139 --> 00:34:05.377 region:rollup2
WAY TO MEDICAID CLIMATE. AND BE

00:34:03.808 --> 00:34:07.045 region:rollup2
THOSE CARBON SINKS TO

00:34:05.377 --> 00:34:08.914 region:rollup2
QUESTION CARBON SO I WANTED TO

00:34:07.045 --> 00:34:10.949 region:rollup2
TOUCH VERY BRIEFLY ON THE

00:34:08.914 --> 00:34:12.183 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT CDFA.

00:34:10.949 --> 00:34:13.018 region:rollup2
IT'S BEEN ABLE TO FUND WITH

00:34:12.183 --> 00:34:14.386 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CHANGE INVESTMENT

00:34:13.018 --> 00:34:16.154 region:rollup2
DOLLARS. AND IS A PRETTY

00:34:14.386 --> 00:34:17.522 region:rollup2
IMPRESSIVE AMOUNT OF MONEY OVER

00:34:16.154 --> 00:34:19.357 region:rollup2
THE LAST FIVE YEARS.

00:34:17.522 --> 00:34:20.625 region:rollup2
IN THAT DEPTH OF THE DROUGHT WE

00:34:19.357 --> 00:34:23.495 region:rollup2
CREATED THE STATEWIDE WATER

00:34:20.625 --> 00:34:25.130 region:rollup2
EFFICIENCY PROGRAM WHICH IS ALL

00:34:23.495 --> 00:34:27.265 region:rollup2
ABOUT ON FARM WATER USE

00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:28.400 region:rollup2
EFFICIENCY. THAT WILL IMPROVE

00:34:27.265 --> 00:34:30.835 region:rollup2
THE EFFICIENT USE OF WATER

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:32.237 region:rollup2
REDUCE WATER USE REDUCE ENERGY

00:34:30.835 --> 00:34:33.672 region:rollup2
USE AND THEREFORE REDUCE

00:34:32.237 --> 00:34:36.074 region:rollup2
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS.

00:34:33.672 --> 00:34:37.842 region:rollup2
TREMENDOUSLY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM

00:34:36.074 --> 00:34:39.711 region:rollup2
OVER FIVE HUNDRED PROJECTS OVER

00:34:37.842 --> 00:34:41.446 region:rollup2
A HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES WITH

00:34:39.711 --> 00:34:42.881 region:rollup2
REAL WATER SAVINGS AND REAL

00:34:41.446 --> 00:34:44.215 region:rollup2
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION

00:34:42.881 --> 00:34:45.817 region:rollup2
REDUCTIONS OVERSUBSCRIBED BY

00:34:44.215 --> 00:34:47.886 region:rollup2
THREE HUNDRED PERCENT.

00:34:45.817 --> 00:34:49.854 region:rollup2
SO WE ARE VERY PLEASED THAT

00:34:47.886 --> 00:34:50.922 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME FUNDING FOR THOSE

00:34:49.854 --> 00:34:52.490 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT'S IN THE BOND THAT

00:34:50.922 --> 00:34:53.491 region:rollup2
WILL BE ON ON THE BALLOT AND WE

00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:55.760 region:rollup2
HOPE THAT THAT PROGRAM WILL

00:34:53.491 --> 00:34:57.262 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO RECEIVE GREENHOUSE

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:58.663 region:rollup2
GAS INVESTMENT DOLLARS.

00:34:57.262 --> 00:35:00.398 region:rollup2
BUT NEITHER PROGRAM THAT HAS

00:34:58.663 --> 00:35:02.467 region:rollup2
GOTTEN A LOT OF ATTENTION AND IT

00:35:00.398 --> 00:35:04.035 region:rollup2
IS A SIGNIFICANT PROGRAM IS FOR

00:35:02.467 --> 00:35:05.503 region:rollup2
OUR TERRY'S WE HAVE ONE POINT

00:35:04.035 --> 00:35:07.872 region:rollup2
EIGHT MILLION DAIRY COWS IN THE

00:35:05.503 --> 00:35:09.207 region:rollup2
STATE. WE WANT TO REDUCE METHANE

00:35:07.872 --> 00:35:11.810 region:rollup2
WAS A SHORT LIVED CLIMATE

00:35:09.207 --> 00:35:13.812 region:rollup2
POLLUTANTS. AND WE HAVE FUNDED

00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:15.380 region:rollup2
DAIRY DIE TESTERS THAT ARE

00:35:13.812 --> 00:35:17.983 region:rollup2
CREATING RENEWABLE ENERGY.

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:18.383 region:rollup2
EITHER ELECTRICITY FOR THE FARM

00:35:17.983 --> 00:35:20.285 region:rollup2
ITSELF

00:35:18.383 --> 00:35:22.120 region:rollup2
I TAKE.

00:35:20.285 --> 00:35:25.757 region:rollup2
TAKE A LOAD OFF THE BREAD BUT

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:28.860 region:rollup2
VERY EXCITINGLY THE ABILITY TO

00:35:25.757 --> 00:35:32.230 region:rollup2
GENERATE RENEWABLE. NATURAL GAS

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:33.965 region:rollup2
TO HEAT OUR HOMES AND TO RUN

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:36.401 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY AS A LOW CARBON

00:35:33.965 --> 00:35:38.236 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION FUEL. THE TRUCKS

00:35:36.401 --> 00:35:39.671 region:rollup2
AND BIG EQUIPMENT GOING UP AND

00:35:38.236 --> 00:35:40.905 region:rollup2
DOWN THE CENTRAL VALLEY HIGHWAYS

00:35:39.671 --> 00:35:42.607 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT'S AN EXCITING NEW

00:35:40.905 --> 00:35:44.509 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY WE NEED SOME

00:35:42.607 --> 00:35:47.245 region:rollup2
STABILITY AND CERTAINTY IN THOSE

00:35:44.509 --> 00:35:48.713 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS AS WE PROTRACTED. MORE

00:35:47.245 --> 00:35:51.316 region:rollup2
DEVELOPERS TO COME INTO THIS.

00:35:48.713 --> 00:35:53.451 region:rollup2
BUT THE DAIRY SECTOR HAS STEPPED

00:35:51.316 --> 00:35:55.854 region:rollup2
UP AND CALIFORNIA GOING FROM

00:35:53.451 --> 00:35:57.555 region:rollup2
THREE JERRY DIED TESTERS A FEW

00:35:55.854 --> 00:35:59.024 region:rollup2
SHORT YEARS AGO TO BEING THE

00:35:57.555 --> 00:36:01.559 region:rollup2
NUMBER ONE STATE AND NOTHING

00:35:59.024 --> 00:36:02.727 region:rollup2
REDUCTION IS A PRETTY LAUDABLE.

00:36:01.559 --> 00:36:04.062 region:rollup2
ACCOMPLISHMENT AND WE WANT TO

00:36:02.727 --> 00:36:05.864 region:rollup2
CONTINUE DOING THAT WE ALSO HAVE

00:36:04.062 --> 00:36:07.832 region:rollup2
AN ALTERNATIVE MANURE MANAGEMENT

00:36:05.864 --> 00:36:09.934 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WHICH FITS IN VERY

00:36:07.832 --> 00:36:11.603 region:rollup2
NICELY WITH AN INTEGRATED

00:36:09.934 --> 00:36:14.539 region:rollup2
RESOURCE MANAGEMENT APPROACH.

00:36:11.603 --> 00:36:16.107 region:rollup2
WHERE WE CAN USE THAT WHAT WE

00:36:14.539 --> 00:36:17.475 region:rollup2
USED TO THINK OF AS WASTE? AS

00:36:16.107 --> 00:36:19.611 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT HAS VALUABLE

00:36:17.475 --> 00:36:21.546 region:rollup2
NUTRIENTS IN AT HOW CAN WE DO A

00:36:19.611 --> 00:36:23.381 region:rollup2
SEPARATION HOW DO WE CAN WE GET

00:36:21.546 --> 00:36:25.116 region:rollup2
THAT INTO COMPOSTING. BUT AT THE

00:36:23.381 --> 00:36:26.651 region:rollup2
OTHER BYPRODUCTS COULD BE

00:36:25.116 --> 00:36:28.787 region:rollup2
CREATED WITH S. AND COULD BE

00:36:26.651 --> 00:36:30.989 region:rollup2
MOVED TO AREAS THAT ARE.

00:36:28.787 --> 00:36:33.458 region:rollup2
NUTRIENT.

00:36:30.989 --> 00:36:35.493 region:rollup2
DEFICIT ADDED AND GET IT OUT OF

00:36:33.458 --> 00:36:36.528 region:rollup2
AREAS WHERE THEY THEY HAVE AT. A

00:36:35.493 --> 00:36:37.062 region:rollup2
LARGE BALANCES THAT

00:36:36.528 --> 00:36:39.130 region:rollup2
SO THAT PROGRAM FITS VERY

00:36:37.062 --> 00:36:40.598 region:rollup2
NICELY%

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:42.467 region:rollup2
WITH A HEALTHY SOILS PROGRAM

00:36:40.598 --> 00:36:43.468 region:rollup2
WHICH IS AN EXCITING PROGRAM

00:36:42.467 --> 00:36:44.969 region:rollup2
THAT REALLY IS ABOUT WHAT OF

00:36:43.468 --> 00:36:46.438 region:rollup2
THOSE PRACTICES THAT WE COULD

00:36:44.969 --> 00:36:49.407 region:rollup2
PUT ON THE GROUND TO SEQUESTER

00:36:46.438 --> 00:36:51.476 region:rollup2
CARBON. AND INCREASE THE CARBON

00:36:49.407 --> 00:36:53.311 region:rollup2
IN OUR SOILS THE ORGANIC MATTER

00:36:51.476 --> 00:36:55.847 region:rollup2
IN OUR SOILS SO THAT THEY CAN

00:36:53.311 --> 00:36:58.516 region:rollup2
RETAIN MORE WATER. AND HELP WITH

00:36:55.847 --> 00:37:00.385 region:rollup2
GOOD PRODUCTIVITY FOR PLANTS

00:36:58.516 --> 00:37:02.387 region:rollup2
IT'S AN EXCITING NEW PROGRAM WE

00:37:00.385 --> 00:37:04.289 region:rollup2
JUST STARTED THAT LAST YEAR WE

00:37:02.387 --> 00:37:06.191 region:rollup2
HAVE OVER FIVE MILLION DOLLARS

00:37:04.289 --> 00:37:07.859 region:rollup2
IN GRANTS OUT TO FARMERS AND

00:48:36.247 --> 00:48:39.450 region:rollup2
INSTITUTE WORKING VERY CLOSELY

00:48:37.948 --> 00:48:41.185 region:rollup2
WITH CDFA.

00:48:39.450 --> 00:48:42.787 region:rollup2
FOR INSTANCE A FEW EXAMPLES OF

00:48:41.185 --> 00:48:44.955 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'VE GOT GOING ON IS WE

00:48:42.787 --> 00:48:46.891 region:rollup2
NOW CAN USE DRONES TO DETECT

00:48:44.955 --> 00:48:48.492 region:rollup2
PEST DAMAGE ON CROPS SO THAT

00:48:46.891 --> 00:48:49.827 region:rollup2
PESTICIDES MAY BE APPLIED

00:48:48.492 --> 00:48:52.029 region:rollup2
QUICKLY AND MUCH MORE

00:48:49.827 --> 00:48:52.563 region:rollup2
STRATEGICALLY. TO THE AFFECTED

00:48:52.029 --> 00:48:54.031 region:rollup2
AREA RATHER THAN AN ENTIRE

00:48:52.563 --> 00:48:55.432 region:rollup2

SCIENTISTS AND ENTREPRENEURS

00:48:55.432 --> 00:48:57.935 region:rollup2
HAVE ALSO DEVELOP PRECISION AG

00:48:56.967 --> 00:48:59.270 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY THAT AMONG OTHER

00:48:57.935 --> 00:49:00.838 region:rollup2
BENEFITS.

00:48:59.270 --> 00:49:02.773 region:rollup2
GREATLY REDUCE WATER USE AN

00:49:00.838 --> 00:49:04.809 region:rollup2
INCREASE YIELDS.

00:49:02.773 --> 00:49:06.410 region:rollup2
MANY OF THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES

00:49:04.809 --> 00:49:07.745 region:rollup2
REQUIRE CLOUD COMPUTING

00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:09.847 region:rollup2
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND

00:49:07.745 --> 00:49:11.515 region:rollup2
BROADBAND ACCESS SO THAT DATA

00:49:09.847 --> 00:49:13.551 region:rollup2
MAY BE UPLOADED AND DOWNLOADED

00:49:11.515 --> 00:49:15.219 region:rollup2
FROM THE FIELD. AND PROCESSED

00:49:13.551 --> 00:49:17.054 region:rollup2
INTO USABLE ACTIONS

00:49:15.219 --> 00:49:18.556 region:rollup2
I RECENTLY TESTIFIED ON THIS

00:49:17.054 --> 00:49:19.890 region:rollup2
TOPIC BEFORE THE LITTLE HOOVER

00:49:18.556 --> 00:49:21.058 region:rollup2

STATE.

00:49:36.607 --> 00:49:40.344 region:rollup2
HIGH SPEED INTERNET ACCESS IS

00:49:38.342 --> 00:49:41.612 region:rollup2
THE GATEWAY TO ONLINE EDUCATION

00:49:40.344 --> 00:49:43.180 region:rollup2
TELEHEALTH AND OTHER IMPORTANT

00:49:41.612 --> 00:49:45.182 region:rollup2

OF WHAT THE BROADBAND ACCESS AND

00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:59.330 region:rollup2
QUALITY IS THROUGHOUT THE STATE

00:49:57.795 --> 00:50:00.464 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES TO GET

00:49:59.330 --> 00:50:01.999 region:rollup2
FUNDING IN MANY PARTS OF THE

00:50:00.464 --> 00:50:03.234 region:rollup2
STATE IS THAT THERE ISN'T REALLY

00:50:01.999 --> 00:50:04.835 region:rollup2
GOOD MAPPING.

00:50:03.234 --> 00:50:06.804 region:rollup2
THE CP YOU SEE IS DEVELOPED AN

00:50:04.835 --> 00:50:08.739 region:rollup2

DAY FOR A WEEK THAT WILL.

00:50:17.715 --> 00:50:20.885 region:rollup2
DOCUMENT HOW GOOD THE UPLOAD

00:50:19.149 --> 00:50:22.720 region:rollup2
DOWNLOAD SPEED IS THE QUALITY OF

00:50:20.885 --> 00:50:23.287 region:rollup2
THE SIGNAL GEO REFERENCE THAT

00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:25.656 region:rollup2
AND SHIP IT STRAIGHT TO THE

CPUC.

00:50:25.656 --> 00:50:29.059 region:rollup2
AND THEN THEY AND ARE IN

00:50:27.658 --> 00:50:31.095 region:rollup2
INFORMATICS AND SHOULD BE AYE

00:50:29.059 --> 00:50:32.897 region:rollup2

TO IMPROVE THAT.

00:50:39.436 --> 00:50:42.873 region:rollup2
IT'S EXAMPLE OF ONE OF THE MANY

.

00:51:05.563 --> 00:51:07.965 region:rollup2
ONE THING THAT HAS BAFFLED ME

00:51:06.964 --> 00:51:10.167 region:rollup2
SINCE THE DAY I TOOK THIS

00:51:07.965 --> 00:51:11.735 region:rollup2
POSITION WAS THAT WE DON'T HAVE

00:51:10.167 --> 00:51:14.204 region:rollup2
A RESEARCH EXTENSION CENTER IN

00:51:11.735 --> 00:51:16.040 region:rollup2
THE SALINAS VALLEY. WHICH SEEMS

00:51:14.204 --> 00:51:17.741 region:rollup2
VERY WRONG ON MANY LEVELS.

00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:19.810 region:rollup2
OF NOT HAVING THE TWENTY OR

00:51:17.741 --> 00:51:21.579 region:rollup2
THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS TO SET

00:51:19.810 --> 00:51:22.646 region:rollup2
SUCH A THING UP.

CENTER.

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:39.797 region:rollup2
IT NOT ONLY WILL FACILITATE

00:51:38.562 --> 00:51:42.166 region:rollup2
THAT KIND OF RESEARCH I'VE BEEN

00:51:39.797 --> 00:51:43.334 region:rollup2
DESCRIBING ALREADY BUT WILL GIVE

00:51:42.166 --> 00:51:45.336 region:rollup2
THOSE COMMITTEE COLLEGE STUDENTS

00:51:43.334 --> 00:51:47.371 region:rollup2

THAT THE UC IS INVOLVED IN AND

00:52:54.438 --> 00:52:57.074 region:rollup2
YOUR WORK AT YOU SEE AN ARMS

00:52:56.407 --> 00:52:59.276 region:rollup2
BEEN TRICKED TREMENDOUS.

FOR THIS COMMITTEE AS WELL AS

00:53:00.077 --> 00:53:02.613 region:rollup2
WE'VE LOOKED AT A ISSUES ALL

00:53:01.979 --> 00:53:04.548 region:rollup2
OVER THE STATE.

00:53:02.613 --> 00:53:09.086 region:rollup2
<u><c.green>ARE ANY QUESTIONS FOR</c></u>

00:53:04.548 --> 00:53:10.354 region:rollup2
MISTER MISTER.

00:53:09.086 --> 00:53:10.888 region:rollup2
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK AND THAT

00:53:10.354 --> 00:53:13.824 region:rollup2
LET'S GET THAT.

00:53:10.888 --> 00:53:15.559 region:rollup2
A FACILITY GOING IN SALINAS I

00:53:13.824 --> 00:53:16.927 region:rollup2
LIKE. THE IDEA I MEAN WE WHEN

00:53:15.559 --> 00:53:17.795 region:rollup2
YOU REALLY THINK ABOUT IT IT'S

00:53:16.927 --> 00:53:20.864 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE MOST PRODUCTIVE.

00:53:17.795 --> 00:53:22.599 region:rollup2
VALLEYS IN IN THE STATE AND TO

00:53:20.864 --> 00:53:24.601 region:rollup2
NOT HAVE A A RESEARCH

00:53:22.599 --> 00:53:26.403 region:rollup2
INSTITUTION THEY'RE OUT WORKING

00:53:24.601 --> 00:53:27.938 region:rollup2
WITH PART NOW COLLEGE IS THAT.

00:53:26.403 --> 00:53:28.906 region:rollup2
THE IT OVERSIGHT IT THEY'RE

00:53:27.938 --> 00:53:30.140 region:rollup2
DOING SOME TREMENDOUS WORK AT

00:53:28.906 --> 00:53:31.909 region:rollup2
THEIR THEIR COULD PARTNER.

00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:33.377 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY THE FACILITY WE HAVE

00:53:31.909 --> 00:53:35.112 region:rollup2
DOWN IN THE VENTURA SANTA

00:53:33.377 --> 00:53:36.880 region:rollup2
BARBARA AREA IS NOT ADEQUATE

00:53:35.112 --> 00:53:38.549 region:rollup2
EITHER WERE PARTNERING THERE

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:40.651 region:rollup2
WERE LOOKING APARTMENT THERE WAS

00:53:38.549 --> 00:53:41.351 region:rollup2
CSU CHANNEL ISLANDS. AND WE'RE

00:53:40.651 --> 00:53:42.653 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THOSE KIND OF

00:53:41.351 --> 00:53:43.720 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIPS ALL OVER THE STATE

00:53:42.653 --> 00:53:45.456 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I REALLY THINK THAT'S

00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:48.358 region:rollup2
HOW WE BETTER LEVERAGE OUR

00:53:45.456 --> 00:53:50.828 region:rollup2
FINITE RESOURCES AND BETTER

00:53:48.358 --> 00:53:54.098 region:rollup2
SERVE OUR CITIZENS ON EVERY

00:53:50.828 --> 00:53:55.432 region:rollup2
SINGLE REGION HAS. THE CLAIM

00:53:54.098 --> 00:53:57.367 region:rollup2
IT'S DIFFERENT THE SOILS

00:53:55.432 --> 00:54:01.572 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT BUT THE CROPS THAT ARE

00:53:57.367 --> 00:54:03.107 region:rollup2
BEING GROWN ARE DIFFERENT SO TO

00:54:01.572 --> 00:54:03.974 region:rollup2
pLOOK AT THAT AND TRY TO FIGURE

00:54:03.107 --> 00:54:05.209 region:rollup2
OUT WHAT THE. BEST SOLUTIONS ARE

00:54:03.974 --> 00:54:06.744 region:rollup2
FOR INCREASING YIELD AND

00:54:05.209 --> 00:54:07.878 region:rollup2
PROTECTING THE PUBLIC AND THAT'S

01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:26.289 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONAL LIFE TO PROMOTING

01:00:25.021 --> 01:00:28.325 region:rollup2
BEST PRACTICES FOR SOME GROWN

01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:29.926 region:rollup2
CANNABIS FARMERS. AND A HEALTHY

01:00:28.325 --> 01:00:31.361 region:rollup2
SAFE AND SUSTAINABLE CANNABIS

01:00:29.926 --> 01:00:32.596 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY. EARLY ONE I THINK THE

01:00:31.361 --> 01:00:35.499 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE FOR.

01:00:32.596 --> 01:00:37.667 region:rollup2
THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY

01:00:35.499 --> 01:00:39.135 region:rollup2
ABOUT A SON GROWN CANNABIS

01:00:37.667 --> 01:00:40.937 region:rollup2
COMMISSION.

01:00:39.135 --> 01:00:44.474 region:rollup2
WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE

01:00:40.937 --> 01:00:46.209 region:rollup2
NUMEROUS QUESTIONS WHICH ON YOU

01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:49.479 region:rollup2
KNOW ALL OF THIS IS KIND OF A

01:00:46.209 --> 01:00:51.314 region:rollup2
SURPRISE TO ME TOO. BUT ABOUT

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:54.184 region:rollup2
WHY.

01:00:51.314 --> 01:00:56.553 region:rollup2
TO SEPARATE A COMMISSIONS WOULD

01:00:54.184 --> 01:00:58.188 region:rollup2
BE NECESSARY.

01:00:56.553 --> 01:01:00.357 region:rollup2
AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT WE

01:00:58.188 --> 01:01:03.360 region:rollup2
DO STRONGLY SUPPORT THE

01:01:00.357 --> 01:01:04.194 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT OF TWO SEPARATE AG

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:07.564 region:rollup2
COMMISSIONS.

01:01:04.194 --> 01:01:09.733 region:rollup2
THE PRIMARY REASONS FOR THE

01:01:07.564 --> 01:01:11.635 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHMENT OF A SON GROWN A

01:01:09.733 --> 01:01:15.138 region:rollup2
COMMISSION VERSUS AN ALL

01:01:11.635 --> 01:01:18.074 region:rollup2
INCLUSIVE AG COMMISSION. REALLY

01:01:15.138 --> 01:01:20.310 region:rollup2
IS THE FACT THAT OUT TORN MIX

01:01:18.074 --> 01:01:23.413 region:rollup2
LATE TIER ONE FARMERS WHICH

01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:25.949 region:rollup2
WOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE SUN

01:01:23.413 --> 01:01:31.988 region:rollup2
GROWN A COMMISSION.

01:01:25.949 --> 01:01:32.622 region:rollup2
HAVE VERY DIFFERENT MEANS IN

01:01:31.988 --> 01:01:38.795 region:rollup2
THE INDUSTRY ESPECIALLY NOR ARE

01:01:32.622 --> 01:01:40.430 region:rollup2
THEY SUBJECT TO.

01:01:38.795 --> 01:01:42.632 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE

01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:44.734 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS BOTH OF THESE PIECES

01:01:42.632 --> 01:01:47.938 region:rollup2
ARE NOT ONLY INCREDIBLY ONEROUS

01:01:44.734 --> 01:01:49.706 region:rollup2
BUT INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE TUCSON

01:01:47.938 --> 01:01:52.108 region:rollup2
GROUND FARMERS MANY OF WHOM.

01:01:49.706 --> 01:01:54.411 region:rollup2
ALSO FARM ON THE LAND IN WHICH

01:01:52.108 --> 01:01:55.912 region:rollup2
THEY LIVE ON THEIR FARM IN THEIR

01:01:54.411 --> 01:01:57.948 region:rollup2
HOME STATES.

01:01:55.912 --> 01:01:58.448 region:rollup2
AND SO WHILE SOME GROUND

01:01:57.948 --> 01:02:01.251 region:rollup2
CULTIVATORS BASED ON THE

01:01:58.448 --> 01:02:04.988 region:rollup2
STATE'S.

01:02:01.251 --> 01:02:06.389 region:rollup2
OF OUR PIR POTENTIALLY MAKE UP

01:02:04.988 --> 01:02:08.758 region:rollup2
EIGHTY PERCENT OF CALIFORNIANS

01:02:06.389 --> 01:02:10.527 region:rollup2
CULTIVATORS CURRENTLY THEY ONLY

01:02:08.758 --> 01:02:13.863 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT

01:02:10.527 --> 01:02:16.132 region:rollup2
OF THE MARKET SHARE. SO WHILE WE

01:02:13.863 --> 01:02:18.134 region:rollup2
ARE THE UNDERDOG IN MANY WAYS.

01:02:16.132 --> 01:02:19.970 region:rollup2
WE ARE ALSO THE MOST HEAVILY

01:02:18.134 --> 01:02:21.104 region:rollup2
REGULATED AND SPENDING THE MOST

01:02:19.970 --> 01:02:22.772 region:rollup2
MONEY TO TRY TO COME INTO

01:02:21.104 --> 01:02:24.841 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE IN A REGULATED

01:02:22.772 --> 01:02:27.277 region:rollup2
MARKETPLACE.

01:02:24.841 --> 01:02:28.445 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY THE RESEARCH NEEDS

01:02:27.277 --> 01:02:29.913 region:rollup2
OF SOME GROUND CULTIVATORS ARE

01:02:28.445 --> 01:02:33.516 region:rollup2
VASTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE

01:02:29.913 --> 01:02:36.186 region:rollup2
RESEARCH NEEDS OF INDOOR MIX

01:02:33.516 --> 01:02:38.355 region:rollup2
LATER TO CULTIVATORS. ON THE

01:02:36.186 --> 01:02:40.924 region:rollup2
RESEARCH THAT WE REALLY NEED IS

01:02:38.355 --> 01:02:44.427 region:rollup2
A ASSISTANCE IN DEVELOPING AN

01:02:40.924 --> 01:02:47.397 region:rollup2
APPELLATION OF ORIGIN ON

01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:48.298 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE IN IN SHARING NOT OUR

01:02:47.397 --> 01:02:52.669 region:rollup2
ACTIVITIES.

01:02:48.298 --> 01:02:55.639 region:rollup2
BECOME MORE SUSTAINABLE ON

01:02:52.669 --> 01:02:59.109 region:rollup2
LEAVE A SMALLER FOOTPRINT AND

01:02:55.639 --> 01:02:59.442 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE DIVERSITY WITHIN OUR

01:02:59.109 --> 01:03:00.510 region:rollup2
WATER SHUTS.

01:02:59.442 --> 01:03:01.978 region:rollup2
THE RESEARCH THAT'S NEEDED FOR

01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:03.880 region:rollup2
INDOOR CULTIVATORS LARGELY AS A

01:03:01.978 --> 01:03:04.681 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT RIGHT

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:05.915 region:rollup2
HOW CAN ENTER CULTIVATORS

01:03:04.681 --> 01:03:06.750 region:rollup2
RELYING ON HIGH INTENSITY

01:03:05.915 --> 01:03:07.817 region:rollup2
DISCHARGE LIGHTING TO ENSURE

01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:09.019 region:rollup2
THAT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO

01:03:07.817 --> 01:03:11.588 region:rollup2
CULTIVATE YEAR ROUND.

01:03:09.019 --> 01:03:12.489 region:rollup2
THIS IS GOING TO BE LOOKING AT

01:03:11.588 --> 01:03:13.923 region:rollup2
I'M MORE EFFICIENCY IS THE

01:03:12.489 --> 01:03:14.491 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGICAL AREA SO THEY CAN

01:03:13.923 --> 01:03:15.959 region:rollup2
REDUCE THE CARBON FOOTPRINT

01:03:14.491 --> 01:03:17.661 region:rollup2
THAT'S OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH IN

01:03:15.959 --> 01:03:20.063 region:rollup2
HIGH INTENSITY DISCHARGE LIGHT

01:03:17.661 --> 01:03:22.499 region:rollup2
USAGE. TWO VERY DIFFERENT ENDS

01:03:20.063 --> 01:03:23.500 region:rollup2
OF THE SPECTRUM CLEARLY SON

01:03:22.499 --> 01:03:23.900 region:rollup2
SPECTRUM VERSUS LIGHTS PATTERN.

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:24.968 region:rollup2
SO.

01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:27.003 region:rollup2
WE REALLY.

01:03:24.968 --> 01:03:28.772 region:rollup2
WANT TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT

01:03:27.003 --> 01:03:31.107 region:rollup2
OF ALL ASPECTS OF THE INDUSTRY

01:03:28.772 --> 01:03:33.276 region:rollup2
ARM WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT I AM.

01:03:31.107 --> 01:03:34.544 region:rollup2
AMONGST SOME GROUND CULTIVATORS

01:03:33.276 --> 01:03:37.614 region:rollup2
WE TEND TO BE THE SMALLEST

01:03:34.544 --> 01:03:37.614 region:rollup2
PRODUCERS IN THE STATE AND THEN

01:03:37.681 --> 01:03:41.551 region:rollup2
OF THE SUN GROWN CULTIVATOR THE

01:03:40.684 --> 01:03:43.053 region:rollup2
SPECIALTY COTTAGE HERE.

01:03:41.551 --> 01:03:45.088 region:rollup2
THEY ARE AT MOST RISK OF GOING

01:03:43.053 --> 01:03:47.691 region:rollup2
EXTINCT AND SO WE REALLY

01:03:45.088 --> 01:03:50.060 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY LOOK FORWARD TO.

01:03:47.691 --> 01:03:51.861 region:rollup2
HELPING THEM OUT WITH THE SUN

01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:53.763 region:rollup2
GROWN A COMMISSION WERE LOOKING

01:03:51.861 --> 01:03:55.732 region:rollup2
AT TIERED ASSESSMENTS. THAT

01:03:53.763 --> 01:03:57.734 region:rollup2
WOULD ALLOW THEM THE ABILITY TO

01:03:55.732 --> 01:03:59.569 region:rollup2
REAP THE BENEFITS OF AND

01:03:57.734 --> 01:04:01.137 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE IN A SUN GROWN A

01:03:59.569 --> 01:04:02.906 region:rollup2
COMMISSION WITHOUT NECESSARILY

01:04:01.137 --> 01:04:04.941 region:rollup2
HAVING TO PAY ASSESSMENTS. SO WE

01:04:02.906 --> 01:04:05.608 region:rollup2
WOULD SCALE THE ASSESSMENTS UPS

01:04:04.941 --> 01:04:08.144 region:rollup2
OF THE LARGER.

01:04:05.608 --> 01:04:09.312 region:rollup2
AND THE MORE YOU PRODUCE AS A

01:04:08.144 --> 01:04:10.680 region:rollup2
SIGN GROUND FARMER THE MORE

01:04:09.312 --> 01:04:12.682 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT YOU PAYS SO IT HELPS

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:15.685 region:rollup2
TO LIFT THE ENTIRE.

01:04:12.682 --> 01:04:17.220 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY OP AS IT GOES ON THE

01:04:15.685 --> 01:04:19.956 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE IS CURRENTLY PRETTY

01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:22.659 region:rollup2
BOILERPLATE HATE OR WORKING ON.

01:04:19.956 --> 01:04:24.094 region:rollup2
NUMEROUS EVENTS TO GATHER

01:04:22.659 --> 01:04:26.162 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDER INPUT TO MAKE SURE

01:04:24.094 --> 01:04:27.197 region:rollup2
THAT WE EMBODY THE NEEDS OF THE

01:04:26.162 --> 01:04:29.466 region:rollup2
SONOGRAM FARMERS.

01:04:27.197 --> 01:04:32.235 region:rollup2
WE HAVE HELD LISTENING%

01:04:29.466 --> 01:04:34.871 region:rollup2
ADVANCING UKIAH EUREKA SANTA

01:04:32.235 --> 01:04:38.508 region:rollup2
BARBARA AND MONTEREY SO FAR WILL

01:04:34.871 --> 01:04:40.744 region:rollup2
BE IN SAN RAFAEL ON FRIDAY. AND

01:04:38.508 --> 01:04:43.580 region:rollup2
THEN WE LOOK FORWARD TO DOING IT

01:04:40.744 --> 01:04:45.348 region:rollup2
ALL OVER AGAIN TO GET MORE INPUT

01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:47.684 region:rollup2
SO.

01:04:45.348 --> 01:04:49.719 region:rollup2
I REALLY THINK YOU FOR LETTING

01:04:47.684 --> 01:04:52.655 region:rollup2

SPELLING HOPES MOVE IT FORWARD

01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:07.437 region:rollup2
THINKING EVERY MATCH.

01:05:06.369 --> 01:05:08.571 region:rollup2
HI THANK YOU THE COMMITTEE MY

ALSO A SMALL LICENSE HOLDER. AND

01:05:09.706 --> 01:05:11.608 region:rollup2
I'M COME FROM A MULTI

01:05:10.206 --> 01:05:13.610 region:rollup2
GENERATIONAL CANNABIS FAMILY UP

01:05:11.608 --> 01:05:15.545 region:rollup2
IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. I'M I

01:05:13.610 --> 01:05:16.146 region:rollup2
WAS BORN IN MENDOCINO IN THE

01:05:15.545 --> 01:05:16.813 region:rollup2
HEIGHT OF THE BACK TO THE LAND

01:05:16.146 --> 01:05:18.214 region:rollup2
MOVEMENT.

01:05:16.813 --> 01:05:18.848 region:rollup2
OF MY FAMILY DID NOT SURVIVE THE

01:05:18.214 --> 01:05:19.516 region:rollup2
DRUG WAR INTACT AND I SPENT MY

01:05:18.848 --> 01:05:20.917 region:rollup2
MOST OF MY CHILDHOOD IN

01:05:19.516 --> 01:05:21.484 region:rollup2
TRADITIONAL AGRICULTURE. MY MOM

01:05:20.917 --> 01:05:22.819 region:rollup2
TOOK US WITH HER LOVE FOR

01:05:21.484 --> 01:05:24.354 region:rollup2
AGRICULTURE INTO THE DESERT

01:05:22.819 --> 01:05:24.988 region:rollup2
SOUTHWEST WHERE SHE RAISED

01:05:24.354 --> 01:05:26.222 region:rollup2
VEGETABLE SEEDS AND CONTRACTED

01:05:24.988 --> 01:05:27.323 region:rollup2
FARMS FOR PRODUCTION. AND SO I

01:05:26.222 --> 01:05:28.658 region:rollup2
GREW UP IN A MORE TRADITIONAL

01:05:27.323 --> 01:05:30.059 region:rollup2
AGRICULTURE.

01:05:28.658 --> 01:05:31.127 region:rollup2
CITING A MY MOVE BACK TEHAMA

01:05:30.059 --> 01:05:31.761 region:rollup2
COUNTY TWENTY YEARS AGO AND I'M

01:05:31.127 --> 01:05:32.896 region:rollup2
A PART OF THAT CANNABIS CULTURE

01:05:31.761 --> 01:05:33.530 region:rollup2
AND THE BACK TO AND MOVEMENT

01:05:32.896 --> 01:05:36.733 region:rollup2
THAT EXISTS THERE STILL TO OUR

01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:38.101 region:rollup2
VALUES AND OUR. COMMUNITY. AND

01:05:36.733 --> 01:05:39.135 region:rollup2
SEE THROUGH THIS CHANGING

01:05:38.101 --> 01:05:40.537 region:rollup2
REGULATORY LANDSCAPE THAT SON

01:05:39.135 --> 01:05:42.739 region:rollup2
GROUND CANNABIS HAS MORE IN

01:05:40.537 --> 01:05:44.274 region:rollup2
COMMON WITH AGRICULTURE THAN IT

01:05:42.739 --> 01:05:45.942 region:rollup2
DOES WITH INDOOR CANNABIS WHILE

01:05:44.274 --> 01:05:47.610 region:rollup2
WE HAVE MANY SIMILARITIES WHERE

01:05:45.942 --> 01:05:49.212 region:rollup2
WE WILL COME TOGETHER. SANGRAM

01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:50.680 region:rollup2
CANNABIS FACES ALL THESE UNIQUE

01:05:49.212 --> 01:05:52.348 region:rollup2
REGULATORY NEEDS I DON'T NEED TO

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:54.684 region:rollup2
GET INTO THEM SINCE SHE DID BUT

01:05:52.348 --> 01:05:56.986 region:rollup2
WE ON OURS SUPER TINY FARMS.

01:05:54.684 --> 01:05:58.988 region:rollup2
FACE THE TRADITIONAL SEASONAL

01:05:56.986 --> 01:06:00.657 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS SUCH AS RECENTLY

01:05:58.988 --> 01:06:04.494 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CHANGE AND FIRES AND MUD

01:06:00.657 --> 01:06:05.261 region:rollup2
SLIDES NEW PASS WE FACE.

01:06:04.494 --> 01:06:06.996 region:rollup2
RAINFALL ALL KINDS OF SEASONAL

01:06:05.261 --> 01:06:08.531 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATIONS AND JUST WORKING

01:06:06.996 --> 01:06:11.267 region:rollup2
WITHIN THAT WINDOW OF THE

01:06:08.531 --> 01:06:12.669 region:rollup2
NATURAL SEASONS IN ADDITION TO

01:06:11.267 --> 01:06:13.903 region:rollup2
FISH AND WILDLIFE REGIONAL WATER

SETBACKS IN SO MANY DIFFERENT

01:06:18.908 --> 01:06:22.078 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WE FACE.

01:06:20.276 --> 01:06:23.379 region:rollup2
I'M WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO

01:06:22.078 --> 01:06:24.647 region:rollup2
AMORTIZE THOSE COSTS

01:06:23.379 --> 01:06:26.316 region:rollup2
AND SO EVERYTHING THAT KAREN

01:06:24.647 --> 01:06:27.617 region:rollup2
ROSS SPOKE ON THIS MORNING WAS

01:06:26.316 --> 01:06:28.852 region:rollup2
DEAR TO OUR HEART WE TALK ABOUT

01:06:27.617 --> 01:06:30.386 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CHANGE WE TALK ABOUT

01:06:28.852 --> 01:06:33.189 region:rollup2
CARBON SEQUESTRATION WE TALK

01:06:30.386 --> 01:06:34.424 region:rollup2
ABOUT. CALIFORNIA'S LEGACY AND

01:06:33.189 --> 01:06:35.925 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA SUNSHINE AND HOW

01:06:34.424 --> 01:06:38.361 region:rollup2
BEAUTIFUL IT IS AND IT'S PART OF

01:06:35.925 --> 01:06:40.063 region:rollup2
OUR STORY. AND WANTING TO SEE

01:06:38.361 --> 01:06:43.566 region:rollup2
THAT SIGNED ON CULTIVATORS HAVE

SOMEONE ELSE COULD.

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:21.063 region:rollup2
ARTICULATE FOR ME HOW OR WHEN WE

01:13:18.928 --> 01:13:23.499 region:rollup2
LOOK AT IT AS FAR AS LICENSED.

01:13:21.063 --> 01:13:24.667 region:rollup2
OUTDOOR CULTIVATORS.

01:13:23.499 --> 01:13:26.068 region:rollup2
VERSES LICENSE INDOOR

01:13:24.667 --> 01:13:27.169 region:rollup2
CULTIVATORS WHAT'S THE NUMBER

01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:34.277 region:rollup2

CALIFORNIA VERSUS UNLICENSED.

I'M SORRY NEED YEAH YEAH I THINK

01:13:35.544 --> 01:13:40.683 region:rollup2
THAT YOU MIGHT NEED TO GO TO.

01:13:38.748 --> 01:13:42.318 region:rollup2
THE NEW STATE AGENCY THAT.

01:13:40.683 --> 01:13:43.619 region:rollup2
THAT'S I MEAN YOU MIGHT IF YOU

01:13:42.318 --> 01:13:44.754 region:rollup2
DO KNOW THAT YOU'RE FREE TO GIVE

01:13:43.619 --> 01:13:46.122 region:rollup2
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE HERE

01:13:44.754 --> 01:13:48.291 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAS THAT NUMBER BECAUSE

01:13:46.122 --> 01:13:49.392 region:rollup2
IT'S CHANGING NUMBER. YEAH I I

01:13:48.291 --> 01:13:51.661 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK WE KNOW LICENSE

01:13:49.392 --> 01:13:55.264 region:rollup2
VERSES UNLICENSED APPLES TIME.

01:13:51.661 --> 01:13:57.233 region:rollup2
I DO KNOW THAT WE ARE EXPECTING.

01:13:55.264 --> 01:13:58.734 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIALLY MORE LICENSED

01:13:57.233 --> 01:14:00.102 region:rollup2
OUTDOOR MIX LATE HERE ONE

01:13:58.734 --> 01:14:01.504 region:rollup2
CULTIVATORS TO COME ONLINE IN

01:14:00.102 --> 01:14:03.706 region:rollup2
HUMBLE COUNTY THEY DID JUST

01:14:01.504 --> 01:14:05.207 region:rollup2
ISSUE AN ADDITIONAL SEVEN

01:14:03.706 --> 01:14:07.710 region:rollup2
HUNDRED PERMITS.

01:14:05.207 --> 01:14:09.645 region:rollup2
BUT. BEYOND THAT IT'S VERY HARD

01:14:07.710 --> 01:14:12.014 region:rollup2
TO QUANTIFY THE NUMBER OF SAY

01:14:09.645 --> 01:14:13.683 region:rollup2
UNLICENSED OPERATORS.

01:14:12.014 --> 01:14:15.217 region:rollup2
IN THE STATE RIGHT AND IN ONE

01:14:13.683 --> 01:14:16.652 region:rollup2
ONE THING THAT YOU KNOW IS WE'RE

01:14:15.217 --> 01:14:17.887 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT DATA THAT DOES COME

01:14:16.652 --> 01:14:19.455 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT THE REVENUES

01:14:17.887 --> 01:14:20.556 region:rollup2
BELOW PROJECTIONS AND I THINK

01:14:19.455 --> 01:14:22.758 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THAT IS

01:14:20.556 --> 01:14:24.427 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE BARRIER. TO A

01:14:22.758 --> 01:14:25.895 region:rollup2
MEETING THE REGULATORY.

01:14:24.427 --> 01:14:27.296 region:rollup2
STANDARDS THAT ARE ARE

01:14:25.895 --> 01:14:28.998 region:rollup2
NECESSARY FOR THAT LICENSE

WHOLESALERS AND RETAILERS TO

THEN DISTRIBUTE AND SELL IT.

01:14:33.836 --> 01:14:38.107 region:rollup2
AND DIE A LOT OF THEM ACTUALLY

01:14:36.539 --> 01:14:39.875 region:rollup2
BUY. EXTRA.

01:14:38.107 --> 01:14:41.177 region:rollup2
BEFORE JANUARY.

01:14:39.875 --> 01:14:43.346 region:rollup2
TO TO MEET THE NEED THAT THEY

01:14:41.177 --> 01:14:44.914 region:rollup2
HAD BECAUSE THEY HAD ANTICIPATED

01:14:43.346 --> 01:14:46.349 region:rollup2
THE REGULATORY HURDLE BEING ONE

01:14:44.914 --> 01:14:46.549 region:rollup2
THAT WAS SUBSTANTIAL.

01:14:46.349 --> 01:14:48.718 region:rollup2
AND.

01:14:46.549 --> 01:14:51.687 region:rollup2
THE HOPE IS FOR THESE

01:14:48.718 --> 01:14:52.021 region:rollup2
COMMISSIONS TO.

01:14:51.687 --> 01:14:53.222 region:rollup2
HELP.

01:14:52.021 --> 01:14:55.124 region:rollup2
GROWERS FIGURE OUT WHAT THE

01:14:53.222 --> 01:14:55.691 region:rollup2
BEST PRACTICES ARE AND HOW THE

01:14:55.124 --> 01:14:56.926 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONAL LIES SO THAT WE

01:14:55.691 --> 01:14:58.361 region:rollup2
CAN.

01:14:56.926 --> 01:15:00.029 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

01:14:58.361 --> 01:15:00.863 region:rollup2
HOW THE ONES THAT WERE IN

01:15:00.029 --> 01:15:01.831 region:rollup2
DISMISSING CAN MEET THOSE

01:15:00.863 --> 01:15:03.632 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS?

01:15:01.831 --> 01:15:04.700 region:rollup2
BE LICENSED

01:15:03.632 --> 01:15:06.535 region:rollup2
AN AND I THINK ONE OF THE

01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:07.903 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT PIECES OF WHAT'S

01:15:06.535 --> 01:15:09.205 region:rollup2
HAPPENING SPECIFICALLY WITH SOME

01:15:07.903 --> 01:15:11.207 region:rollup2
GROUND FARMERS RIGHT NOW IS

01:15:09.205 --> 01:15:14.343 region:rollup2
THERE FINING THAT THE. COST OF

01:15:11.207 --> 01:15:16.912 region:rollup2
REGULATION IS SO HIGH THAT

01:15:14.343 --> 01:15:18.881 region:rollup2
THEY'RE LOSING MONEY CURRENTLY.

01:15:16.912 --> 01:15:21.951 region:rollup2
THEY'RE HOPING THAT THEY CAN.

01:15:18.881 --> 01:15:23.953 region:rollup2
KIND OF MANAGE THE BLEEDING OF

01:15:21.951 --> 01:15:26.322 region:rollup2
THE HEMORRHAGING OF FUNDS UNTIL

01:15:23.953 --> 01:15:29.091 region:rollup2
THE MARKET BALANCES ITSELF OUT

01:15:26.322 --> 01:15:30.059 region:rollup2
WE GOT ON ENOUGH RETELL ENTITIES

01:15:29.091 --> 01:15:30.393 region:rollup2
ONLINE.

01:15:30.059 --> 01:15:32.628 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:15:30.393 --> 01:15:34.163 region:rollup2
WERE SUFFERING FROM FARMERS

01:15:32.628 --> 01:15:36.899 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DROPPING OUT OF THE

01:15:34.163 --> 01:15:39.101 region:rollup2
REGULATED SYSTEM BECAUSE THEY.

01:15:36.899 --> 01:15:41.070 region:rollup2
THEY CAN'T AFFORD THE COST

01:15:39.101 --> 01:15:46.542 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED TO ENGAGE IN ILLEGAL

01:15:41.070 --> 01:15:48.644 region:rollup2
MARKETPLACE.

01:15:46.542 --> 01:15:49.712 region:rollup2
SO WE MAY HAVE MISSED THAT THAT

01:15:48.644 --> 01:15:51.447 region:rollup2
PART OF HER TESTIMONY WHICH I

01:15:49.712 --> 01:15:52.214 region:rollup2
THOUGHT WAS EXCELLENT IN REGARDS

01:15:51.447 --> 01:15:54.784 region:rollup2
TO THE DIFFERENCE IN THE

01:15:52.214 --> 01:15:56.085 region:rollup2
REGULATORY BURDENS ON INDOOR AND

01:15:54.784 --> 01:15:58.354 region:rollup2
OUTDOOR AND I THINK THAT THAT.

01:15:56.085 --> 01:15:59.789 region:rollup2
AYE IT FRANKLY MY MY PITCH WAS

01:15:58.354 --> 01:16:01.090 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE REALLY NEED TO GET

01:15:59.789 --> 01:16:03.292 region:rollup2
GET EVERYBODY TOGETHER AND TRY

01:16:01.090 --> 01:16:04.427 region:rollup2
TO WORK IT OUT. UP BECAUSE THAT

01:16:03.292 --> 01:16:06.362 region:rollup2
IT MAKES IT STRONGER BUT I'M

01:16:04.427 --> 01:16:08.164 region:rollup2
CONVINCED THAT THERE REALLY ARE

01:16:06.362 --> 01:16:10.132 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT BURDENS ON ON.

01:16:08.164 --> 01:16:11.700 region:rollup2
THE OUTDOOR AS OPPOSED TO THE

01:16:10.132 --> 01:16:14.070 region:rollup2
INDOOR AND UP TO THE EXTENT THAT

01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:16.072 region:rollup2
YOU'VE GOT THE INDUSTRY SAYING

01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:17.940 region:rollup2
LET'S DO TWO SEPARATE ONES UP I

01:16:16.072 --> 01:16:19.108 region:rollup2
I I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM

01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:20.109 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S PROBABLY

01:16:19.108 --> 01:16:20.976 region:rollup2
GONNA BE FIVE WHICH YOU'RE GONNA

01:16:20.109 --> 01:16:22.878 region:rollup2

NEXT COMMITTEE AND WILL HAVE THE

01:16:26.415 --> 01:16:29.218 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO BRING IT BACK IF

01:16:27.683 --> 01:16:30.553 region:rollup2
IF IT CHANGES SUBSTANTIALLY AND

01:16:29.218 --> 01:16:31.353 region:rollup2
WE DON'T LIKE WHAT IT WHAT IT

01:16:30.553 --> 01:16:33.622 region:rollup2
SAYS BECAUSE.

01:16:31.353 --> 01:16:36.058 region:rollup2

HOW WE CAN INHIBIT?

01:17:25.508 --> 01:17:28.344 region:rollup2

INDUSTRY IS REALLY GOING TO GO.

01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:19.228 region:rollup2

OPPORTUNITY TO MERGE THOSE

01:18:39.748 --> 01:18:43.385 region:rollup2

AND AND BASICALLY. IT IN A

01:21:54.243 --> 01:21:56.979 region:rollup2
MARKETPLACE AND MAKE HIM MAKE

01:21:56.512 --> 01:21:58.280 region:rollup2
YOUR PRODUCT YOU KNOW.

ORGANIC THEY'RE ABLE TO GET

01:22:14.196 --> 01:22:17.633 region:rollup2
BETTER VALUE FOR THEIR PRODUCT.

01:22:16.131 --> 01:22:18.967 region:rollup2

THE COSTS MAY BE DIFFERENT.

01:22:18.967 --> 01:22:21.904 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY'RE ABLE TO GET

PROMOTE AND MARKET AND MARKET.

01:23:13.222 --> 01:23:16.658 region:rollup2
THEIR PRODUCTS YES THERE'S ALSO

01:23:14.890 --> 01:23:18.460 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO.

01:23:16.658 --> 01:23:20.095 region:rollup2
WORK THE REGULATORY BARRIERS ONE

01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:20.429 region:rollup2
THAT I CAN THINK OF AND RICE

01:23:20.095 --> 01:23:22.431 region:rollup2
WOULD BE THE.

01:23:20.429 --> 01:23:23.832 region:rollup2
.

01:23:22.431 --> 01:23:25.200 region:rollup2
IRRIGATED LANDS PROGRAM AND

01:23:23.832 --> 01:23:26.335 region:rollup2
KINDA COMING INTO COMPLIANCE

01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:28.570 region:rollup2
WITH THAT.

01:23:26.335 --> 01:23:30.439 region:rollup2
BUT LARGELY IT'S ABOUT

01:23:28.570 --> 01:23:32.207 region:rollup2
MARKETING AND SO. LET'S TAKE A

01:23:30.439 --> 01:23:33.108 region:rollup2
LITTLE STEP BACK.

01:23:32.207 --> 01:23:35.010 region:rollup2
THIS ISN'T AN AGRICULTURAL

01:23:33.108 --> 01:23:35.878 region:rollup2
PRODUCT.

01:23:35.010 --> 01:23:38.180 region:rollup2
IN THE NORMAL WAY THAT WE'VE

01:23:35.878 --> 01:23:40.582 region:rollup2
SEEN THIS ISN'T LIKE DRIED PLUMS

01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:41.817 region:rollup2
AND MORE AND WALNUTS AND RICE.

01:23:40.582 --> 01:23:43.485 region:rollup2
WE'RE STILL DO WHAT THE SCHEDULE

01:23:41.817 --> 01:23:45.787 region:rollup2
ONE DRUG.

01:23:43.485 --> 01:23:47.523 region:rollup2
LARGELY THIS IS THE END USE OF

01:23:45.787 --> 01:23:48.924 region:rollup2
THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE SMOKED.

01:23:47.523 --> 01:23:50.525 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW THERE'S ALSO

01:23:48.924 --> 01:23:52.027 region:rollup2
EDIBLES AND AND THINGS OF THAT

01:23:50.525 --> 01:23:54.029 region:rollup2
NATURE AS WELL BUT LARGE THAT'S

01:23:52.027 --> 01:23:55.364 region:rollup2
WHAT IT IS. AND I WOULD JUST ASK

01:23:54.029 --> 01:23:57.132 region:rollup2
THIS BODY LIKE.

01:23:55.364 --> 01:23:58.433 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD WE DON'T GROW TOBACCO

01:23:57.132 --> 01:24:01.370 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA?

01:23:58.433 --> 01:24:02.871 region:rollup2
BUT IF WE DID WOULD YOU BE OKAY

01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:06.575 region:rollup2
WITH THE A PROMOTIONAL.

01:24:02.871 --> 01:24:07.943 region:rollup2
COMMISSION FOR TOBACCO PRODUCTS.

01:24:06.575 --> 01:24:09.845 region:rollup2
THE A WE'RE GONNA BAND TOGETHER

01:24:07.943 --> 01:24:11.246 region:rollup2
AND PROMOTE THE USE OF OF

01:24:09.845 --> 01:24:13.482 region:rollup2
TOBACCO I DON'T SEE TOO MUCH OF

01:24:11.246 --> 01:24:14.750 region:rollup2
A DIFFERENCE.

01:24:13.482 --> 01:24:16.385 region:rollup2
WITH WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IN

01:24:14.750 --> 01:24:17.786 region:rollup2
NOT AND AND TO ME THAT'S NOT THE

01:24:16.385 --> 01:24:19.621 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE.

01:24:17.786 --> 01:24:20.188 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE PLACE FOR THIS THERE

01:24:19.621 --> 01:24:21.757 region:rollup2
ARE HEALTH THERE ARE HEALTH

01:24:20.188 --> 01:24:23.425 region:rollup2
ANOTHER.

01:24:21.757 --> 01:24:24.526 region:rollup2
ISSUES ASSOCIATE WITH MARIJUANA

01:24:23.425 --> 01:24:27.696 region:rollup2
ALL WE'VE DONE IN CALIFORNIA'S

01:24:24.526 --> 01:24:29.631 region:rollup2
IT MADE IT LEGAL. FOR ADULTS.

01:24:27.696 --> 01:24:30.599 region:rollup2
TO RECREATIONALLY USES.

01:24:29.631 --> 01:24:33.468 region:rollup2
WE HAVEN'T NECESSARILY MADE THIS

01:24:30.599 --> 01:24:34.870 region:rollup2
INTO AN AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY.

01:24:33.468 --> 01:24:36.772 region:rollup2
AND THEY TREATED IT THE SAME WAY

01:24:34.870 --> 01:24:37.306 region:rollup2
AS AN AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY AND

01:24:36.772 --> 01:24:38.540 region:rollup2
I HONESTLY DON'T THINK WE

01:24:37.306 --> 01:24:40.442 region:rollup2
SHOULD.

01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:41.843 region:rollup2
SOLIDUS BACCHUS UP AND SAY IS

01:24:40.442 --> 01:24:43.512 region:rollup2
THIS REALLY THE APPROPRIATE

01:24:41.843 --> 01:24:44.646 region:rollup2
THING TO BE CREATING A MARKET OR

01:24:43.512 --> 01:24:46.315 region:rollup2
MARKETING PROMOTIONAL.

01:24:44.646 --> 01:24:48.383 region:rollup2
COMMISSION.

01:24:46.315 --> 01:24:50.085 region:rollup2
FOR CALIFORNIA GROWN AND I'LL

01:24:48.383 --> 01:24:51.987 region:rollup2
I'LL GIVE THE AUTHORS VERY

01:24:50.085 --> 01:24:53.388 region:rollup2
CLEVERLY NAMED COMMISSION.

01:24:51.987 --> 01:24:56.124 region:rollup2
SON GROWN YOU KNOW.

01:24:53.388 --> 01:24:57.459 region:rollup2
MAKES IT SOUND LIKE GOMEZ IS

01:24:56.124 --> 01:24:57.759 region:rollup2
LIKE A RAISINS OR SOMETHING

01:24:57.459 --> 01:24:58.927 region:rollup2
RIGHT YEAH.

01:24:57.759 --> 01:25:00.462 region:rollup2
.

01:24:58.927 --> 01:25:01.630 region:rollup2
BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS I DON'T

01:25:00.462 --> 01:25:03.565 region:rollup2
KNOW THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE

01:25:01.630 --> 01:25:04.733 region:rollup2
PLACE FOR A COMMISSION.

01:25:03.565 --> 01:25:06.368 region:rollup2
TO BE FORMED.

01:25:04.733 --> 01:25:07.936 region:rollup2
.

01:25:06.368 --> 01:25:09.504 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

01:25:07.936 --> 01:25:10.639 region:rollup2
IMPLICATIONS TO THAT. THAT WE

01:25:09.504 --> 01:25:12.207 region:rollup2
SHOULD THINK ABOUT THIS A LITTLE

01:25:10.639 --> 01:25:13.875 region:rollup2
BIT PREMATURE THIS INDUSTRY

01:25:12.207 --> 01:25:15.410 region:rollup2
HASN'T REALLY GOTTEN OUT THERE.

01:25:13.875 --> 01:25:16.845 region:rollup2
I MEAN IT'S VERY MUCH IN ITS

01:25:15.410 --> 01:25:18.413 region:rollup2
INFANCY THERE'S LOT OF THINGS WE

01:25:16.845 --> 01:25:20.048 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW ABOUT SO TO CREATE A

01:25:18.413 --> 01:25:22.117 region:rollup2
COMMISSION.

01:25:20.048 --> 01:25:24.086 region:rollup2
AND THEN ALSO DID NOT ONLY THAT

01:25:22.117 --> 01:25:25.887 region:rollup2
LET'S CREATE TWO COMMISSIONS.

01:25:24.086 --> 01:25:27.089 region:rollup2
AND SPLIT THOSE UP IN A WAY WE

01:25:25.887 --> 01:25:28.623 region:rollup2
NEVER HAVE BEFORE WHY SHOULD WE

01:25:27.089 --> 01:25:30.292 region:rollup2
DO THAT.

01:25:28.623 --> 01:25:31.526 region:rollup2
WHY SHOULD WE TREAT THIS SO MUCH

01:25:30.292 --> 01:25:32.961 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTLY THAN WE'VE TREATED

01:25:31.526 --> 01:25:35.464 region:rollup2
AS ANYTHING ELSE?

01:25:32.961 --> 01:25:37.466 region:rollup2
AND SO YEAH I WOULD JUST SAY AT

01:25:35.464 --> 01:25:39.001 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IT'S NOT READY THIS

01:25:37.466 --> 01:25:41.069 region:rollup2
ISN'T FULLY COOKED.

01:25:39.001 --> 01:25:42.804 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW SO MAYBE WE MAYBE WE

01:25:41.069 --> 01:25:43.772 region:rollup2
SHOULD THE.

01:25:42.804 --> 01:25:45.507 region:rollup2
YEAH I THINK I THINK TAKE A

01:25:43.772 --> 01:25:47.309 region:rollup2
PAUSE ON THIS AYE I AM I WILL BE

01:25:45.507 --> 01:25:48.744 region:rollup2
VOTING NO TODAY AND BUT I THINK

01:25:47.309 --> 01:25:49.211 region:rollup2
THIS IS A LOT MORE TIME BEFORE

01:25:48.744 --> 01:25:50.946 region:rollup2
WE JUST MOVE FOR SOME

01:25:49.211 --> 01:25:53.448 region:rollup2
COMMISSION.

01:25:50.946 --> 01:25:56.018 region:rollup2
THAT OBVIOUSLY STILL HAS A LOT

01:25:53.448 --> 01:25:58.453 region:rollup2
OF ISSUES EVEN AMONGST ITS OWN.

01:25:56.018 --> 01:26:00.589 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY A HAS A LOT OF ISSUES I

01:25:58.453 --> 01:26:01.123 region:rollup2
I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE

01:26:00.589 --> 01:26:03.659 region:rollup2
TO VOTE THIS DOWN TODAY.

01:26:01.123 --> 01:26:04.493 region:rollup2
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:26:03.659 --> 01:26:06.728 region:rollup2
I GUESS I LOOK AT A LITTLE BIT

01:26:04.493 --> 01:26:08.196 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTLY NAM.

01:26:06.728 --> 01:26:09.798 region:rollup2
THE VOTERS HAVE DECIDED THIS IS

01:26:08.196 --> 01:26:12.067 region:rollup2
A LEGAL POT PRODUCT AND I LOOK

01:26:09.798 --> 01:26:14.236 region:rollup2

OVER INDULGE.

01:26:17.606 --> 01:26:21.076 region:rollup2
IT'S

01:26:18.974 --> 01:26:22.044 region:rollup2
YOU'RE IN TROUBLE.

01:26:21.076 --> 01:26:23.712 region:rollup2
AND.

01:26:22.044 --> 01:26:25.180 region:rollup2

BOTH INDOOR OUTDOOR TOGETHER

01:26:29.618 --> 01:26:32.721 region:rollup2
WORK TOGETHER AND AND SEE IF

01:26:31.086 --> 01:26:34.990 region:rollup2
THERE'S LIKE A COMPROMISE.

01:26:32.721 --> 01:26:36.391 region:rollup2
I SEE THAT THERE IS A

01:26:34.990 --> 01:26:38.060 region:rollup2
COMPROMISE COMPROMISES THEY

01:26:36.391 --> 01:26:40.195 region:rollup2
WANNA BE SEPARATE AND MAYBE AT

01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:41.296 region:rollup2
SOME POINT THEY DO WORK TOGETHER

01:26:40.195 --> 01:26:41.463 region:rollup2
AND IT BECOMES ONE COMMISSION

01:26:41.296 --> 01:26:42.564 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:26:41.463 --> 01:26:44.332 region:rollup2
.

01:26:42.564 --> 01:26:46.134 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHENEVER IT BUSINESS

01:26:44.332 --> 01:26:47.536 region:rollup2
COMES FORWARD TO ME ESPECIALLY

01:26:46.134 --> 01:26:49.104 region:rollup2
IN THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY AND

01:26:47.536 --> 01:26:50.572 region:rollup2
SAYS LOOK WE WANT IS WE WANT TO

01:26:49.104 --> 01:26:51.940 region:rollup2
CREATE A BOARD.

01:26:50.572 --> 01:26:53.975 region:rollup2
ARE A COMMISSION AND WERE

01:26:51.940 --> 01:26:55.844 region:rollup2
WILLING TO IT CHARGE OURSELVES.

01:26:53.975 --> 01:26:58.013 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE CAN THEN GET

01:26:55.844 --> 01:26:59.715 region:rollup2
INFORMATION DISSEMINATED AMONG

01:26:58.013 --> 01:27:01.183 region:rollup2
OUR MEMBERS I HATE THAT I REALLY

01:26:59.715 --> 01:27:03.285 region:rollup2
DON'T GET INVOLVED IN SAYING NO

01:27:01.183 --> 01:27:04.619 region:rollup2
I I JUST DON'T THINK THAT. YOU

01:27:03.285 --> 01:27:05.687 region:rollup2
DESERVE TO HAVE YOUR OWN BOARD

01:27:04.619 --> 01:27:07.722 region:rollup2
AYE IT WE GET TO THE EXTENT THAT

01:27:05.687 --> 01:27:09.057 region:rollup2
WE'VE. BLAST AGRICULTURAL BOARDS

01:27:07.722 --> 01:27:10.492 region:rollup2
AND COMMISSIONS.

01:27:09.057 --> 01:27:11.159 region:rollup2
IF IF THEY COME FORWARD I KIND

01:27:10.492 --> 01:27:13.261 region:rollup2
OF FEEL LIKE.

01:27:11.159 --> 01:27:14.763 region:rollup2
THERE'S A THERE'S A PURPOSE AND

01:27:13.261 --> 01:27:16.431 region:rollup2
THERE'S A REASON AND.

01:27:14.763 --> 01:27:19.501 region:rollup2
FOR ME THIS IS.

01:27:16.431 --> 01:27:23.538 region:rollup2
A SITUATION WHERE IT IT IS A IT

01:27:19.501 --> 01:27:25.273 region:rollup2
IS A. IN IS IN ITS INFANCY. AND

01:27:23.538 --> 01:27:27.709 region:rollup2
UP THERE IS A LOT TO LEARN AND A

01:27:25.273 --> 01:27:29.778 region:rollup2
LOT TO KNOW IN ORDER TO STAY

01:27:27.709 --> 01:27:31.446 region:rollup2
WITHIN THAT. THE LANES THAT THE

01:27:29.778 --> 01:27:32.481 region:rollup2
STATE HAS SET UP IN ORDER FOR

01:27:31.446 --> 01:27:33.915 region:rollup2
THIS.

01:27:32.481 --> 01:27:35.283 region:rollup2
A INDUSTRY MOVE FORWARD AND

01:27:33.915 --> 01:27:36.718 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A LOT THERE ARE A LOT

01:27:35.283 --> 01:27:38.253 region:rollup2
OF REGULATIONS AND THERE'S A LOT

01:27:36.718 --> 01:27:39.755 region:rollup2
OF REGULATIONS BECAUSE BECAUSE

01:27:38.253 --> 01:27:40.756 region:rollup2
JUST LIKE ALCOHOL IT'S TREATED

01:27:39.755 --> 01:27:42.190 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTLY THAN OTHER

01:27:40.756 --> 01:27:44.493 region:rollup2
AGRICULTURE PRODUCTS.

01:27:42.190 --> 01:27:44.793 region:rollup2
ANYTHING THAT IS. THAT HAS THE

01:27:44.493 --> 01:27:48.163 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO.

01:27:44.793 --> 01:27:51.833 region:rollup2
.

01:27:48.163 --> 01:27:53.769 region:rollup2
TO GET YOU. DRUNK HIGH OR.

01:27:51.833 --> 01:27:56.238 region:rollup2
IMPAIRED IN A WAY THAT AFFECTS

01:27:53.769 --> 01:27:58.173 region:rollup2
OTHER PEOPLE THERE'S REGULATION.

01:27:56.238 --> 01:27:59.141 region:rollup2
AND SO I SEE THIS RIGHT RIGHT

01:27:58.173 --> 01:28:00.876 region:rollup2
ALONG THE LINE WITH WITH

01:27:59.141 --> 01:28:03.278 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING ELSE AND SO I I'M NOT

01:28:00.876 --> 01:28:04.779 region:rollup2
OPPOSED TO HAVING IT GO FORWARD

01:28:03.278 --> 01:28:07.182 region:rollup2
IN AND HAVING IT BE TWO SEPARATE

01:28:04.779 --> 01:28:09.751 region:rollup2
COMMISSIONS. ON IF IN IN THAT

01:28:07.182 --> 01:28:10.652 region:rollup2
PROCESS IT IT'S DECIDED THAT ONE

01:28:09.751 --> 01:28:11.953 region:rollup2
WOULD BE BETTER I'M OKAY WITH

01:28:10.652 --> 01:28:14.356 region:rollup2
THAT TOO BUT.

01:28:11.953 --> 01:28:16.892 region:rollup2
BUT I'M WE THAT'S THAT'S WHERE

YOU'RE GOING STE SO THE WAY THAT

01:28:18.593 --> 01:28:21.329 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS WORKS HERE AT THAT

01:28:21.163 --> 01:28:21.463 region:rollup2
AT.

01:28:21.329 --> 01:28:23.899 region:rollup2
.

01:28:21.463 --> 01:28:25.867 region:rollup2
AT OUR LEVEL IS IT IS THAT

01:28:23.899 --> 01:28:26.601 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE INTERESTED IN

01:28:25.867 --> 01:28:29.971 region:rollup2
ADDING.

01:28:26.601 --> 01:28:32.807 region:rollup2
ANOTHER COMMISSION AND THAT'S.

01:28:29.971 --> 01:28:35.510 region:rollup2
WE DON'T ALLOW AMENDMENTS AT.

01:28:32.807 --> 01:28:37.179 region:rollup2
APPEAR BECAUSE IT IT'S.

01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:38.246 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT'S DONE UP

01:28:37.179 --> 01:28:39.781 region:rollup2
BUT YOU HAVE ANOTHER COMMITTEE

01:28:38.246 --> 01:28:40.882 region:rollup2
HEARING OTHERWISE I WOULDA SAID

COMMODITIES IN THEIR PROMOTING

01:36:29.250 --> 01:36:32.153 region:rollup2

IT'S BECAUSE BY IS MICHAEL.

01:37:13.461 --> 01:37:16.130 region:rollup2
MY QUESTION WAS GOING TO BE JUST

01:37:14.429 --> 01:37:16.831 region:rollup2

01:37:47.595 --> 01:37:50.364 region:rollup2
MEAN. SON SOME FARMERS HAVE TO

01:37:49.731 --> 01:37:51.632 region:rollup2
DO ABOVE WATCH SUITABILITY PLAN

01:37:50.364 --> 01:37:53.901 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING AND I DON'T THINK.

01:37:51.632 --> 01:37:54.936 region:rollup2
HYDROPONIC FARMERS ARE HELD TO

01:37:53.901 --> 01:37:56.537 region:rollup2
THAT SAME STANDARD BECAUSE IT

01:37:54.936 --> 01:37:58.072 region:rollup2
NOT ON ON THE GROUND WATER AS I

01:37:56.537 --> 01:38:00.541 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND IT.

01:37:58.072 --> 01:38:01.142 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:38:00.541 --> 01:38:02.844 region:rollup2
BUT OUR IS YOU CAN BE SOME

01:38:01.142 --> 01:38:05.146 region:rollup2
ATTENTION PAID TO THE MARKET

01:38:02.844 --> 01:38:07.915 region:rollup2
SHARE IT IS IT EQUAL NOW WILL

01:38:05.146 --> 01:38:10.084 region:rollup2
THE GOAL BEFORE TIP TO REMAIN

01:38:07.915 --> 01:38:12.153 region:rollup2
EQUAL AND IS THERE ANY.

01:38:10.084 --> 01:38:14.689 region:rollup2
YEAH.

01:38:12.153 --> 01:38:17.125 region:rollup2
YES YOU MAKE.

01:38:14.689 --> 01:38:17.725 region:rollup2
AND TO THE QUESTION I THINK AND

01:38:17.125 --> 01:38:20.161 region:rollup2
THEN WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON FED

01:38:17.725 --> 01:38:21.696 region:rollup2
HAVE. SO I'M CURRENTLY MARKET

01:38:20.161 --> 01:38:22.296 region:rollup2
SHARE IS GREAT TENNIS SKEWED ON

01:38:21.696 --> 01:38:23.998 region:rollup2
BOTH SIDES RATE SO IF WE'RE

01:38:22.296 --> 01:38:26.834 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT A FLOWER MARKET FOR

01:38:23.998 --> 01:38:28.469 region:rollup2
INHALABLE. ON CONSUMPTION THE

01:38:26.834 --> 01:38:30.772 region:rollup2
MARKET SHARE IS ROUGHLY EIGHTY

01:38:28.469 --> 01:38:31.873 region:rollup2
PLUS PERCENT INDOOR IN THE

01:38:30.772 --> 01:38:35.309 region:rollup2
MARKETPLACE VERSES ABOUT TWENTY

01:38:31.873 --> 01:38:36.277 region:rollup2
PERCENT OR SO FOR A SON GROWN IN

01:38:35.309 --> 01:38:39.614 region:rollup2
THE MARKETPLACE.

01:38:36.277 --> 01:38:39.614 region:rollup2
HOWEVER WHEN WE LOOK AT THE

01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:44.919 region:rollup2
INTO SAY MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS.

01:38:42.450 --> 01:38:46.587 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THOSE MANUFACTURED

01:38:44.919 --> 01:38:48.823 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS ARE BEING.

01:38:46.587 --> 01:38:51.926 region:rollup2
PRODUCED USING SON GROWN

01:38:48.823 --> 01:38:53.961 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS ON LARGELY BECAUSE WE.

01:38:51.926 --> 01:38:55.129 region:rollup2
WELL SOME GRIM PRODUCTS TEND TO

01:38:53.961 --> 01:38:57.331 region:rollup2
TESS CLEANER WE HAVE LESS

01:38:55.129 --> 01:38:59.100 region:rollup2
PESTICIDE USE BECAUSE WHERE I'M

01:38:57.331 --> 01:39:00.635 region:rollup2
A LITTLE MORE BALANCED WITH BUT

01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:02.603 region:rollup2
OFFICIALS IN THE ENVIRONMENT.

01:39:00.635 --> 01:39:04.472 region:rollup2
ANYTHING THERE IS A SECOND PART

01:39:02.603 --> 01:39:06.774 region:rollup2
TO YOUR QUESTION MY APOLOGY I

01:39:04.472 --> 01:39:08.676 region:rollup2
WILL USE MARKET SHARE WILL THERE

01:39:06.774 --> 01:39:10.244 region:rollup2
BE ANY LIKE THAT ATTEMPT OR

01:39:08.676 --> 01:39:12.013 region:rollup2
TRACKING TO SEE OF THAT BALLOT

01:39:10.244 --> 01:39:13.247 region:rollup2
STAYS IN. IF IT STAYS IN THE

01:39:12.013 --> 01:39:14.682 region:rollup2
SAME ROOM THAT IS THAT ANY KIND

01:39:13.247 --> 01:39:16.484 region:rollup2
OF GOAL. I MEAN I THINK IT WOULD

01:39:14.682 --> 01:39:17.485 region:rollup2
BE FABULOUS AND ONCE IN A

01:39:16.484 --> 01:39:18.920 region:rollup2
COMMISSION IS A STYLISH TO

01:39:17.485 --> 01:39:20.555 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER

01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:23.024 region:rollup2
THE REPORTS THAT SHOW WHAT WAS

01:39:20.555 --> 01:39:24.192 region:rollup2
PRODUCED BY REGION AND WHAT THAT

01:39:23.024 --> 01:39:26.260 region:rollup2
LOOKED LIKE IN THE MARKETPLACE

01:39:24.192 --> 01:39:29.931 region:rollup2
HOA WAS UTILIZED. I THINK WERE A

01:39:26.260 --> 01:39:31.032 region:rollup2
WAYS DOWN THE ROAD FROM THAT.

01:39:29.931 --> 01:39:32.366 region:rollup2
SUNBURN FARMERS OF COURSE WOULD

01:39:31.032 --> 01:39:33.467 region:rollup2
LOVE TO SEE A BALANCE IN THE

01:39:32.366 --> 01:39:34.635 region:rollup2
MARKETPLACE IN THE MARKET SHARE

01:39:33.467 --> 01:39:35.937 region:rollup2
BUT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU

01:39:34.635 --> 01:39:38.539 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:39:35.937 --> 01:39:40.007 region:rollup2

01:52:56.570 --> 01:52:59.906 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S POOR IMPORTANT TO

01:52:57.671 --> 01:53:01.875 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THIS ISSUE IN CONTEXT

01:52:59.906 --> 01:53:04.211 region:rollup2
I CALIFORNIA VOTERS HAVE ALREADY

01:53:01.875 --> 01:53:06.146 region:rollup2
SPOKEN LOUD AND CLEAR. NOT

01:53:04.211 --> 01:53:08.215 region:rollup2
SIMPLY FOR CAGE FREE BUT FOR

01:53:06.146 --> 01:53:10.317 region:rollup2
CAGE FREE. BY TWO THOUSAND AND

01:53:08.215 --> 01:53:12.953 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN.

01:53:10.317 --> 01:53:14.955 region:rollup2
NOW ABOUT WHAT IS NOT COVERED IN

01:53:12.953 --> 01:53:16.723 region:rollup2
THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS IS THE

01:53:14.955 --> 01:53:18.759 region:rollup2
FACT THAT MUCH OF THE OPPOSITION

01:53:16.723 --> 01:53:20.694 region:rollup2
TO THIS MEASURE AND TWO THE

01:53:18.759 --> 01:53:22.963 region:rollup2
BALLOT MEASURE. IS THE FACT THAT

01:53:20.694 --> 01:53:25.232 region:rollup2
BOTH OF THEM FAILED TO COMPLY

01:53:22.963 --> 01:53:26.433 region:rollup2
WITH PROPOSITION TWO.

01:53:25.232 --> 01:53:28.769 region:rollup2
THE AMOUNT OF SPACE THAT

01:53:26.433 --> 01:53:29.870 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HANDS WILL RECEIVE

01:53:28.769 --> 01:53:31.838 region:rollup2
MORE THAN THEY ARE GETTING RIGHT

01:53:29.870 --> 01:53:33.840 region:rollup2
NOW IS PRECISELY THIS AMOUNT OF

01:53:31.838 --> 01:53:35.108 region:rollup2
SPACE.

01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:36.476 region:rollup2
NOW THIS HAS BEEN A VERY

01:53:35.108 --> 01:53:38.945 region:rollup2
CONTENTIOUS ISSUE AND IT WAS AT

01:53:36.476 --> 01:53:40.580 region:rollup2
THE TIME OF PROPOSITION TWO BUT

01:53:38.945 --> 01:53:42.516 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. BOTH THE

01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:44.117 region:rollup2
PROPONENTS AND OPPONENTS OF PROP

01:53:42.516 --> 01:53:45.719 region:rollup2
TWO AGREED ON.

01:53:44.117 --> 01:53:46.219 region:rollup2
WAS A CALIFORNIA WOULD BE CAGE

01:53:45.719 --> 01:53:48.588 region:rollup2
FREE BY TWO THOUSAND AND

01:53:46.219 --> 01:53:50.223 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN.

01:53:48.588 --> 01:53:52.059 region:rollup2
AND THAT SPATIAL REQUIREMENTS

01:53:50.223 --> 01:53:53.760 region:rollup2
WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THAT HANDS

01:53:52.059 --> 01:53:56.129 region:rollup2
TO SPREAD BOTH WINGS FULLY

01:53:53.760 --> 01:53:57.164 region:rollup2
WITHOUT ENCROACHING AIR TOUCHING

01:53:56.129 --> 01:53:57.998 region:rollup2
THE SIDES OF THE CAGE OR THEIR

01:53:57.164 --> 01:53:59.966 region:rollup2
HANDS.

01:53:57.998 --> 01:54:02.069 region:rollup2
AND WHILE.

01:53:59.966 --> 01:54:04.171 region:rollup2
THE PROPONENTS FAILED TO SPECIFY

01:54:02.069 --> 01:54:06.773 region:rollup2
AS WELL THEY SHOULD HAVE.

01:54:04.171 --> 01:54:08.342 region:rollup2
INTO THERE WAS COMMONALITY IN

01:54:06.773 --> 01:54:10.143 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT THAT THAT WOULD NEVER

01:54:08.342 --> 01:54:12.279 region:rollup2
BE LESS THAN A FOOT AND A HALF.

01:54:10.143 --> 01:54:14.748 region:rollup2
PER HAN.

01:54:12.279 --> 01:54:16.717 region:rollup2
IT IS LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE.

01:54:14.748 --> 01:54:17.751 region:rollup2
TO COMPLY WITH PROPOSITION TWO

01:54:16.717 --> 01:54:18.618 region:rollup2
EITHER THROUGH THE BALLOT

01:54:17.751 --> 01:54:21.054 region:rollup2
MEASURE OR THROUGH THIS

01:54:18.618 --> 01:54:23.957 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION BY PROVIDING ONLY

01:54:21.054 --> 01:54:26.259 region:rollup2
ONE SQUARE FOOT. OF PER BIRD.

01:54:23.957 --> 01:54:28.495 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S NO LOGIC TO ONLY

01:54:26.259 --> 01:54:29.763 region:rollup2
PROVIDING THEM THAT THAT YOU

01:54:28.495 --> 01:54:30.931 region:rollup2
WILL LOOK INTO LEGISLATION THEY

01:54:29.763 --> 01:54:32.499 region:rollup2
BREAK IT DOWN THEY SAY WELL

01:54:30.931 --> 01:54:34.101 region:rollup2
HANDS THAT ARE IN CERTAIN UNITS

01:54:32.499 --> 01:54:35.535 region:rollup2
WILL.

01:54:34.101 --> 01:54:36.970 region:rollup2
SUPPOSED TO GET ONE AND A HALF

01:54:35.535 --> 01:54:38.138 region:rollup2
SQUARE FEET.

01:54:36.970 --> 01:54:39.806 region:rollup2
BUT THEN IF YOU HAVE THE SAME

01:54:38.138 --> 01:54:42.275 region:rollup2
UNIT.

01:54:39.806 --> 01:54:43.477 region:rollup2
AND YOU THROW IN ANOTHER LEVEL.

01:54:42.275 --> 01:54:45.712 region:rollup2
YOU CAN CRAM THIRTY THREE

01:54:43.477 --> 01:54:46.646 region:rollup2
PERCENT MORE HANDS NOT ONLY ON

01:54:45.712 --> 01:54:48.215 region:rollup2
THAT ADDITIONAL LEVEL THAT YOU

01:54:46.646 --> 01:54:50.217 region:rollup2
ADD.

01:54:48.215 --> 01:54:52.018 region:rollup2
BUT ON ALL THE ANIMALS THAT ARE

01:54:50.217 --> 01:54:54.321 region:rollup2
ON THE GROUND AS WELL. THERE'S

01:54:52.018 --> 01:54:56.223 region:rollup2
NO HUMAN HEALTH RATIONALE FOR

01:54:54.321 --> 01:54:58.024 region:rollup2
THAT IN FACT INCREASE STOCKING

01:54:56.223 --> 01:54:59.092 region:rollup2
DENSITIES INCREASES A SEMINAR

01:54:58.024 --> 01:55:00.994 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS THAT WERE THE

01:54:59.092 --> 01:55:02.062 region:rollup2
MOTIVATION. FOR A LOT OF THESE

01:55:00.994 --> 01:55:03.764 region:rollup2
EFFORTS THAT WE'RE THE

01:55:02.062 --> 01:55:04.765 region:rollup2
MOTIVATION STATED BY THE

01:55:03.764 --> 01:55:06.233 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

AGRICULTURE.

01:55:06.233 --> 01:55:08.969 region:rollup2
SO OF THEM THE APPROPRIATE THING

01:55:08.168 --> 01:55:10.837 region:rollup2
TO DO AND THE ONLY

01:55:08.969 --> 01:55:12.672 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTIONAL THING WE BELIEVE

01:55:10.837 --> 01:55:15.142 region:rollup2
AFTER CALIFORNIA OVERWHELMINGLY

01:55:12.672 --> 01:55:16.777 region:rollup2
APPROVED A BAN ON CAGES AND A

01:55:15.142 --> 01:55:20.514 region:rollup2

A TWO HUNDRED SIXTEEN SQUARE

INCHES PER PER HAND.

01:55:23.617 --> 01:55:27.954 region:rollup2
IS TO.

01:55:25.819 --> 01:55:29.055 region:rollup2

TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN.

01:55:33.927 --> 01:55:36.763 region:rollup2
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

01:55:35.228 --> 01:55:37.864 region:rollup2
PROPONENTS OF THE BALLOT MEASURE

01:55:36.763 --> 01:55:40.033 region:rollup2
AND THE PROPONENTS OF THIS

01:55:37.864 --> 01:55:42.269 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION. IS THAT ONE SAYS

01:55:40.033 --> 01:55:44.671 region:rollup2

AFTER IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE

01:55:46.006 --> 01:55:49.342 region:rollup2
ENACTED. AND THERE'S ANOTHER

01:55:47.908 --> 01:55:51.578 region:rollup2

BEEN DECIDED BY CALIFORNIA

01:56:00.153 --> 01:56:02.689 region:rollup2

DETRIMENTAL TO WELFARE AND.

01:57:14.361 --> 01:57:17.030 region:rollup2
THERE'S AS A CLEAR SCIENTIFIC

01:57:16.196 --> 01:57:18.632 region:rollup2
BASIS FOR THIS IT'S NOT JUST AN

01:57:17.030 --> 01:57:20.233 region:rollup2
EMOTIONAL CONCERNS BASED ON

01:57:18.632 --> 01:57:21.568 region:rollup2

FIRST CENTURY. AND SPECIFICALLY

02:18:36.341 --> 02:18:39.077 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDED INCREASING THE

02:18:37.809 --> 02:18:39.645 region:rollup2
DOLLARS

02:18:39.077 --> 02:18:42.681 region:rollup2
FOR THE PAST PREVENTION. OF

02:18:39.645 --> 02:18:46.185 region:rollup2
PLAN.

02:18:42.681 --> 02:18:49.021 region:rollup2
.

02:18:46.185 --> 02:18:51.657 region:rollup2
DURING MY CAREER I HAVE WORKED

02:18:49.021 --> 02:18:54.359 region:rollup2
IN THE. LAST FORTY YEARS.

02:18:51.657 --> 02:18:54.860 region:rollup2
ON ALMOST EVERY MAJOR INVASIVE

02:18:54.359 --> 02:18:56.728 region:rollup2
PESTS THAT IS COMING TO

02:18:54.860 --> 02:18:59.464 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

02:18:56.728 --> 02:19:01.400 region:rollup2
AND I'VE WORKED O. WITH CDFA AND

02:18:59.464 --> 02:19:03.836 region:rollup2
AND WHAT ITS PARTNERS SUCH AS

02:19:01.400 --> 02:19:06.071 region:rollup2
USDA. DOWN I I MUST ADMIT AT

02:19:03.836 --> 02:19:07.573 region:rollup2
TIMES I WAS HIGHLY CRITICAL BUT

02:19:06.071 --> 02:19:08.874 region:rollup2
THE MAJORITY TO TIMES I BELIEVE

02:19:07.573 --> 02:19:11.210 region:rollup2
WE HAVE.

02:19:08.874 --> 02:19:13.011 region:rollup2
PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST.

02:19:11.210 --> 02:19:13.712 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS IN THE WORLD.

02:19:13.011 --> 02:19:15.948 region:rollup2
IN FACT.

02:19:13.712 --> 02:19:16.448 region:rollup2
WHEN I TRAVEL AROUND THE WORLD

02:19:15.948 --> 02:19:19.017 region:rollup2
WE ARE. BROUGHT UP AS AN

02:19:16.448 --> 02:19:20.452 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE.

02:19:19.017 --> 02:19:22.487 region:rollup2
OF HOW YOU DEAL WITH INVASIVE

02:19:20.452 --> 02:19:24.389 region:rollup2
PESTS.

02:19:22.487 --> 02:19:26.825 region:rollup2
AND I I THINK THAT. THOUGH

02:19:24.389 --> 02:19:29.127 region:rollup2
FUNDING CUTS THROUGH THE YEARS

02:19:26.825 --> 02:19:30.929 region:rollup2
HAVE DRAMATICALLY REDUCED OUR

02:19:29.127 --> 02:19:32.564 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THAT

02:19:30.929 --> 02:19:35.200 region:rollup2
POSITION.

02:19:32.564 --> 02:19:37.236 region:rollup2
WE HAVE SEEN. RECENTLY IN IT

02:19:35.200 --> 02:19:40.105 region:rollup2
INCREASE AS OF US PRESENT HIM

02:19:37.236 --> 02:19:41.673 region:rollup2
SOME MENTION IN PAST COME IN AND

02:19:40.105 --> 02:19:43.876 region:rollup2
TO CALIFORNIA AND WE SEEM AN.

02:19:41.673 --> 02:19:44.977 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN THE COMPLEXITY OF

02:19:43.876 --> 02:19:46.712 region:rollup2
THE PESTS THAT OUR COMMUNITY.

02:19:44.977 --> 02:19:48.180 region:rollup2
THIS IS A SMALL WORLD THAT WE

02:19:46.712 --> 02:19:50.048 region:rollup2
LIVE IN WE HAVE.

02:19:48.180 --> 02:19:51.717 region:rollup2
FORTY MILLION PEOPLE IN

02:19:50.048 --> 02:19:53.785 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WHEN I WAS A.

02:19:51.717 --> 02:19:55.454 region:rollup2
A YOUNG MAN I THINK IT WAS A FEW

02:19:53.785 --> 02:19:58.323 region:rollup2
MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. WE

02:19:55.454 --> 02:19:59.157 region:rollup2
HAVE HUGE URBAN FOREST.

02:19:58.323 --> 02:20:01.693 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BECOME THE NEW

02:19:59.157 --> 02:20:03.528 region:rollup2
PATHWAY FOR INVASIVE SPECIES

02:20:01.693 --> 02:20:05.831 region:rollup2
TO ENTER CALIFORNIA BUILD UP TO

02:20:03.528 --> 02:20:07.399 region:rollup2
TREMENDOUS NUMBERS AND EXPLODE.

02:20:05.831 --> 02:20:09.101 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY INTO AGRICULTURE BUT

02:20:07.399 --> 02:20:10.469 region:rollup2
INTO THE URBAN FORCING RIPARIAN

02:20:09.101 --> 02:20:12.971 region:rollup2
FORESTS.

02:20:10.469 --> 02:20:15.274 region:rollup2
WE ARE NOW FACING MILLIONS OF

02:20:12.971 --> 02:20:17.509 region:rollup2
DOLLARS OF DAMAGE OF. OF NOT

02:20:15.274 --> 02:20:19.111 region:rollup2
ONLY. THE INTRODUCED PLANT

02:20:17.509 --> 02:20:20.479 region:rollup2
SPECIES THAT WE FIND IN OUR

02:20:19.111 --> 02:20:21.013 region:rollup2
LANDSCAPES BUT ALSO OUR NATIVE

02:20:20.479 --> 02:20:22.781 region:rollup2
SPECIES.

02:20:21.013 --> 02:20:24.316 region:rollup2
ARE.

02:20:22.781 --> 02:20:25.217 region:rollup2
ONE PASSED THAT WE'RE DEALING

02:20:24.316 --> 02:20:26.585 region:rollup2
WITH RIGHT NOW THE SHUTTLE

02:20:25.217 --> 02:20:28.921 region:rollup2
BOARDS.

02:20:26.585 --> 02:20:31.323 region:rollup2
OUR NOW HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

02:20:28.921 --> 02:20:33.558 region:rollup2
ESTABLISH THEMSELVES AND SIXTY

02:20:31.323 --> 02:20:36.595 region:rollup2
THREE REPRODUCTIVE POLLS.

02:20:33.558 --> 02:20:39.998 region:rollup2
MANY OF THEM NATIVE SPECIES.

02:20:36.595 --> 02:20:41.767 region:rollup2
AND THE SAN DIEGO. THEY HAD.

02:20:39.998 --> 02:20:43.869 region:rollup2
HUNDRED FORTY FOUR THOUSAND

02:20:41.767 --> 02:20:46.004 region:rollup2
WILLS WHAT'S IS THE. OF.

02:20:43.869 --> 02:20:47.606 region:rollup2
HABITAT FOR INVASIVE SWIMMING

02:20:46.004 --> 02:20:49.808 region:rollup2
FOR A HOME. ENDANGERED SPECIES.

02:20:47.606 --> 02:20:51.276 region:rollup2

02:20:51.276 --> 02:20:55.614 region:rollup2
IN NINE MONTHS.

02:20:53.378 --> 02:20:56.381 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE ALLOW THIS PAST TO

02:20:55.614 --> 02:20:57.916 region:rollup2
BUILD UP IN THE URBAN

02:20:56.381 --> 02:21:00.652 region:rollup2

WE HAVE.

02:21:03.689 --> 02:21:07.492 region:rollup2

TO COUNTIES THAT ACTUALLY HAD

02:42:30.574 --> 02:42:34.011 region:rollup2
THESE MECHANISMS IN PLACE TO

02:42:32.409 --> 02:42:34.178 region:rollup2

02:42:55.532 --> 02:42:58.802 region:rollup2
POOREST COUNTIES IN THE ENTIRE

02:42:57.167 --> 02:43:00.671 region:rollup2
STATE. THEY HAVE SOME OF THE

02:42:58.802 --> 02:43:02.106 region:rollup2
HIGHEST LATINO POPULATIONS IN

02:43:00.671 --> 02:43:03.674 region:rollup2
THE ENTIRE STATE.

02:43:02.106 --> 02:43:05.976 region:rollup2

02:43:05.976 --> 02:43:09.013 region:rollup2
I'M NOT OKAY WITH THAT.

02:43:07.711 --> 02:43:10.314 region:rollup2

02:43:10.314 --> 02:43:13.484 region:rollup2

FOR COUNTIES ARE INCLUDED.

02:43:24.395 --> 02:43:26.864 region:rollup2

02:43:25.696 --> 02:43:28.732 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THAT AS WE LOOK AT

02:43:26.864 --> 02:43:29.800 region:rollup2

A THIRD YEAR THAT I'VE RUN THIS

02:45:03.927 --> 02:45:06.697 region:rollup2
BILL IN THE IN THE PREVIOUS SINK

02:45:04.928 --> 02:45:08.065 region:rollup2
OUR CONSIDERATION IT WAS A

02:45:06.697 --> 02:45:11.034 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE BILL.

02:45:08.065 --> 02:45:13.537 region:rollup2
WE DID TRY TO USE OUR ENERGY

02:45:11.034 --> 02:45:14.705 region:rollup2
EFFICIENCY MONEY FROM THE P. YOU

02:45:13.537 --> 02:45:16.974 region:rollup2
SEE BECAUSE IT WAS A LARGE POT

02:45:14.705 --> 02:45:18.709 region:rollup2
OF MONEY THAT DID NOT GET USED.

02:45:16.974 --> 02:45:20.077 region:rollup2
I THOUGHT IT WAS BETTER USE FOR

02:45:18.709 --> 02:45:21.812 region:rollup2
ENERGY EFFICIENCY LIKE

02:45:20.077 --> 02:45:23.280 region:rollup2
REFRIGERATION I THINK I AND IT

02:45:21.812 --> 02:45:24.782 region:rollup2
WAS A STATEWIDE BILL THAT WAS

02:45:23.280 --> 02:45:26.617 region:rollup2
NOT ON ANY COUNTIES.

02:45:24.782 --> 02:45:29.186 region:rollup2
SO WE DECIDED TO USE MAKE THIS

02:45:26.617 --> 02:45:30.587 region:rollup2
A PILOT DEL SO THIS IS REALLY A

02:45:29.186 --> 02:45:33.056 region:rollup2
PILOT BILL IT'S NOT A.

02:45:30.587 --> 02:45:36.326 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE BILL IN A STARTED OFF

02:45:33.056 --> 02:45:36.960 region:rollup2
AS A SAN FRANCISCO LOS ANGELES

02:45:36.326 --> 02:45:37.161 region:rollup2
BILL BECAUSE THOSE WERE THE ONLY

02:45:36.960 --> 02:45:38.162 region:rollup2
TWO.

02:45:37.161 --> 02:45:39.630 region:rollup2
COUNTIES THAT WE KNEW ACTUALLY

02:45:38.162 --> 02:45:41.265 region:rollup2
HAD

02:45:39.630 --> 02:45:43.033 region:rollup2
EXISTING PROGRAMS SINCE THEN

02:45:41.265 --> 02:45:44.835 region:rollup2
ALAMEDA AND SAN DIEGO EXPRESSED

02:45:43.033 --> 02:45:46.804 region:rollup2

SOLACE YESTERDAY BY PHONE AND I

02:45:46.804 --> 02:45:50.040 region:rollup2
WOULD SAY IF ANY OF YOU. IF

02:45:48.539 --> 02:45:52.976 region:rollup2
YOU'RE COUNTIES OR YOUR CITIES

02:45:50.040 --> 02:45:54.545 region:rollup2
HAVE. COME PROGRAMS THAT ARE A

02:45:52.976 --> 02:45:55.879 region:rollup2
LOT INTEREST WE WILL BE MORE

02:45:54.545 --> 02:45:56.647 region:rollup2
THAN HAPPY TO WORK WITH THEM I

02:45:55.879 --> 02:45:58.949 region:rollup2
THINK WE WERE.

02:45:56.647 --> 02:46:00.250 region:rollup2
WE CHOSE THESE COUNTIES BECAUSE

02:45:58.949 --> 02:46:01.652 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE EXISTING PROGRAMS

02:46:00.250 --> 02:46:03.754 region:rollup2
EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURES WHERE

02:46:01.652 --> 02:46:04.888 region:rollup2
THEY ARE WORKING WITH SMALL

02:46:03.754 --> 02:46:06.423 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES IN DOING

02:46:04.888 --> 02:46:08.926 region:rollup2
REFRIGERATION PROJECTS.

02:46:06.423 --> 02:46:10.794 region:rollup2
WE OBVIOUSLY ARE VERY SENSITIVE

02:46:08.926 --> 02:46:11.829 region:rollup2
TO FISCAL ISSUES IN DIDN'T WANT

02:46:10.794 --> 02:46:13.497 region:rollup2
TO GIVE COUNTIES MONEY THAT WE

02:46:11.829 --> 02:46:14.031 region:rollup2
DIDN'T WANT TO. DO THIS KIND OF

02:46:13.497 --> 02:46:16.066 region:rollup2
WORK.

02:46:14.031 --> 02:46:17.401 region:rollup2
SO IF THERE IS WORK AT THE

02:46:16.066 --> 02:46:20.170 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL WE ARE

02:46:17.401 --> 02:46:21.471 region:rollup2

THEM AND AND BRING THEM.

02:46:21.471 --> 02:46:24.942 region:rollup2
SO MISTER KING EVERY I RECALL

02:46:29.847 --> 02:46:33.550 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTED EIGHT I AM REMEMBER

02:46:31.348 --> 02:46:34.184 region:rollup2

HERE THAT SAYS IS THERE REALLY A

02:46:34.184 --> 02:46:44.495 region:rollup2
PILOT.

02:46:42.593 --> 02:46:46.129 region:rollup2
THAT THAT'S THE WAY THAT WE HAD.

02:46:44.495 --> 02:46:47.731 region:rollup2
IN INTENDED TO CONSTRUE

02:46:46.129 --> 02:46:50.501 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION THE BILL PERHAPS

02:46:47.731 --> 02:46:51.001 region:rollup2
ARE. IT EAST BE MAYBE THERE

02:46:50.501 --> 02:46:52.102 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE MORE GREATER

02:46:51.001 --> 02:46:53.804 region:rollup2
CLARITY.

02:46:52.102 --> 02:46:55.906 region:rollup2

02:46:55.906 --> 02:47:00.110 region:rollup2
IT BEING A PILOT. I CAN'T FIND

02:46:57.941 --> 02:47:01.745 region:rollup2
THE LANGUAGE RIGHT NOW BUT ALSO.

02:47:00.110 --> 02:47:04.081 region:rollup2
PROBABLY NEEDS AB.

02:47:01.745 --> 02:47:06.016 region:rollup2
A I SUNSET DATE SO THAT WE CAN

02:47:04.081 --> 02:47:06.917 region:rollup2
