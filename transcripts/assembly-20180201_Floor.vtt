THIS WITH EITHER THE BEGINNING

00:55:24.688 --> 00:55:27.524 region:rollup2

ACTIVISM.

00:55:27.524 --> 00:55:30.227 region:rollup2

THIS YOUR BLACK PEOPLE IN THIS

COUNTRY OBVIOUSLY IS RATHER

00:56:32.823 --> 00:56:36.560 region:rollup2
UNIQUE AND VIBRANT.

00:56:34.691 --> 00:56:37.961 region:rollup2
AND IT IS ONLY APPROPRIATE THAT

00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:39.296 region:rollup2
WE BEGIN BLACK HISTORY MONTH

00:56:37.961 --> 00:56:40.631 region:rollup2
WITH THE CELEBRATION OF ONE OF

00:56:39.296 --> 00:56:43.467 region:rollup2
ITS MOST SIGNIFICANT ICONS ROSA

00:56:40.631 --> 00:56:44.468 region:rollup2
PARKS.

00:56:43.467 --> 00:56:45.302 region:rollup2
THERE'S VERY LITTLE I CAN TELL

00:56:44.468 --> 00:56:46.803 region:rollup2
YOU ABOUT ALL THE PARTS THAT YOU

00:56:45.302 --> 00:56:48.105 region:rollup2
DON'T ALREADY KNOW.

00:56:46.803 --> 00:56:50.073 region:rollup2
BECAUSE A STORY IS TOLD OVER AND

00:56:48.105 --> 00:56:51.174 region:rollup2
OVER AGAIN.

00:56:50.073 --> 00:56:52.009 region:rollup2
AND WE ALL KNOW THAT SHE WAS A

00:56:51.174 --> 00:56:53.810 region:rollup2
WOMAN OF TREMENDOUS COURAGE AND

00:56:52.009 --> 00:56:54.611 region:rollup2
STRENGTH.

00:56:53.810 --> 00:56:56.380 region:rollup2
WE ALL KNOW THAT SHE REALLY

00:56:54.611 --> 00:56:58.015 region:rollup2
WASN'T PHYSICALLY TIRED ANY MORE

00:56:56.380 --> 00:56:59.316 region:rollup2
THAN SHE HAD BEEN BEFORE.

00:56:58.015 --> 00:57:00.317 region:rollup2
SHE WAS JUST TIRED OF BEING

00:56:59.316 --> 00:57:01.752 region:rollup2
TREATED THE WAY SHE WAS TREATED

00:57:00.317 --> 00:57:02.653 region:rollup2
IN THIS COUNTRY.

00:57:01.752 --> 00:57:04.521 region:rollup2
SHE WAS SICK AND TIRED OF BEING

00:57:02.653 --> 00:57:05.889 region:rollup2
SICK AND TIRED.

00:57:04.521 --> 00:57:07.691 region:rollup2
AND AS A RESULT OF THAT SHE MODE

00:57:05.889 --> 00:57:09.226 region:rollup2
IT MOTIVATED HER TO ONCE AGAIN

00:57:07.691 --> 00:57:11.161 region:rollup2
STAND AND TO STAND FOR WHAT WAS

00:57:09.226 --> 00:57:12.663 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND WHAT WAS JUST.

00:57:11.161 --> 00:57:13.964 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT I TEACH HISTORY TO MY

00:57:12.663 --> 00:57:15.632 region:rollup2
STUDENTS I TRY TO HELP THEM

00:57:13.964 --> 00:57:16.400 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND MORE THAN JUST THE

00:57:15.632 --> 00:57:18.268 region:rollup2
FACTUAL INFORMATION THAT THEY

00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:19.536 region:rollup2
SEE.

00:57:18.268 --> 00:57:20.804 region:rollup2
BUT HOPEFULLY THE GOING FROM ITS

00:57:19.536 --> 00:57:22.806 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT REALLY SHOULD

00:57:20.804 --> 00:57:24.174 region:rollup2
MOTIVATE THEM TO BE A PART OF

00:57:22.806 --> 00:57:26.343 region:rollup2
HISTORY THEMSELVES AND TO MAKE

00:57:24.174 --> 00:57:26.943 region:rollup2
HISTORY IN THEIR LIVES.

00:57:26.343 --> 00:57:28.178 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHEN I THINK OF ROSA

00:57:26.943 --> 00:57:29.479 region:rollup2
PARKS.

00:57:28.178 --> 00:57:31.415 region:rollup2
I OFTEN TALK ABOUT THE POWER OF

00:57:29.479 --> 00:57:32.783 region:rollup2
ONE PERSON.

00:57:31.415 --> 00:57:34.952 region:rollup2
THE POWER OF AN INDIVIDUAL TO

00:57:32.783 --> 00:57:35.552 region:rollup2
BRING CHANGE IN THE MIDST OF ALL

00:57:34.952 --> 00:57:36.987 region:rollup2
OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE

00:57:35.552 --> 00:57:38.221 region:rollup2
FACED WITH.

00:57:36.987 --> 00:57:40.257 region:rollup2
AND ONE LITTLE AFRICAN AMERICAN

00:57:38.221 --> 00:57:41.758 region:rollup2
HISTORY YOU THINK ABOUT THE KIND

00:57:40.257 --> 00:57:43.293 region:rollup2
OF CHALLENGE THAT AFRICAN

00:57:41.758 --> 00:57:45.228 region:rollup2
AMERICANS HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY.

00:57:43.293 --> 00:57:46.163 region:rollup2
TO OVERTURN SLAVERY.

00:57:45.228 --> 00:57:47.431 region:rollup2
THE FIGHT FOR JUSTICE AND

00:57:46.163 --> 00:57:49.733 region:rollup2
EQUALITY AGAINST THE MOST

00:57:47.431 --> 00:57:52.202 region:rollup2
POWERFUL FORCE IN THE WORLD.

00:57:49.733 --> 00:57:52.836 region:rollup2
AND TO BE JUST SMALL INDIVIDUALS

00:57:52.202 --> 00:57:54.204 region:rollup2
WHO DO THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT

00:57:52.836 --> 00:57:55.939 region:rollup2
POWERFUL THEY DON'T COME FROM

00:57:54.204 --> 00:57:57.441 region:rollup2
POWERFUL COUNTRIES THAT CAN COME

00:57:55.939 --> 00:57:59.276 region:rollup2
IN AND DEFEND THEIR IDENTITY AND

00:57:57.441 --> 00:58:01.278 region:rollup2
WHO THEY ARE.

00:57:59.276 --> 00:58:02.846 region:rollup2
AND YET THAT INTERNAL. AND AN

00:58:01.278 --> 00:58:04.314 region:rollup2
INTERNAL PERSEVERANCE IS WHAT

00:58:02.846 --> 00:58:05.983 region:rollup2
DRIVES IN EACH AND EVERY DAY.

00:58:04.314 --> 00:58:07.317 region:rollup2
TO BE A PART OF THIS COUNTRY TO

00:58:05.983 --> 00:58:09.586 region:rollup2
MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND TO DEMAND

00:58:07.317 --> 00:58:10.387 region:rollup2
THAT THEY BE RESPECTED.

00:58:09.586 --> 00:58:12.089 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I THINK OF ROSA PARKS

00:58:10.387 --> 00:58:13.423 region:rollup2
SHE IS NOT THE FIRST TO SET ON

00:58:12.089 --> 00:58:15.092 region:rollup2
THE BUS AND OFTENTIMES YOU HEAR

00:58:13.423 --> 00:58:16.293 region:rollup2
HISTORIANS TALK ABOUT ALL THE

00:58:15.092 --> 00:58:17.961 region:rollup2
OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHO FOUGHT

00:58:16.293 --> 00:58:19.463 region:rollup2
AGAINST THAT SYSTEM.

00:58:17.961 --> 00:58:21.365 region:rollup2
THOSE WHO REFUSED TO GET UP ON

00:58:19.463 --> 00:58:22.532 region:rollup2
THE BUS ALSO REFUSED TO MOVE AND

00:58:21.365 --> 00:58:24.901 region:rollup2
THEY WERE PULLED OFF THE BUS

00:58:22.532 --> 00:58:26.136 region:rollup2
BEATEN DRAG SOMETIMES LYNCHED AS

00:58:24.901 --> 00:58:27.771 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES OF WHAT YOU SHOULD NOT

00:58:26.136 --> 00:58:29.406 region:rollup2
DO.

00:58:27.771 --> 00:58:31.575 region:rollup2
AND YOU THINK ABOUT THAT AND YOU

00:58:29.406 --> 00:58:32.409 region:rollup2
SAY TO SELL ALL. SO SHE WASN'T

00:58:31.575 --> 00:58:33.577 region:rollup2
THE FIRST NO SHE WASN'T BUT

00:58:32.409 --> 00:58:34.578 region:rollup2
THEY'RE STILL COURAGE IN IT

00:58:33.577 --> 00:58:36.446 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THINK ABOUT IT.

00:58:34.578 --> 00:58:38.181 region:rollup2
IF YOU HAD SEEN WHAT THE RESULTS

00:58:36.446 --> 00:58:40.050 region:rollup2
OF YOUR ACTIONS WOULD BE.

00:58:38.181 --> 00:58:41.051 region:rollup2
YOU'D BE LESS LIKELY WILLING TO

00:58:40.050 --> 00:58:42.486 region:rollup2
TAKE THOSE ACTIONS.

00:58:41.051 --> 00:58:43.887 region:rollup2
IT WASN'T THAT SHE DID KNOW THAT

00:58:42.486 --> 00:58:45.856 region:rollup2
SHE WAS GOING TO BE ARRESTED SHE

00:58:43.887 --> 00:58:46.456 region:rollup2
HAD NO IDEA WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO

00:58:45.856 --> 00:58:47.824 region:rollup2
HER SHE KNEW WHAT IT HAPPEN TO

00:58:46.456 --> 00:58:49.793 region:rollup2
OTHERS.

00:58:47.824 --> 00:58:51.728 region:rollup2
AND YET DESPITE THAT BECAUSE IT

00:58:49.793 --> 00:58:53.563 region:rollup2
WAS RIGHT BECAUSE IT WAS JUST

00:58:51.728 --> 00:58:57.034 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT WAS HER TIME.

00:58:53.563 --> 00:58:57.601 region:rollup2
SHE DECIDED TO DO THAT ANYWAY.

00:58:57.034 --> 00:58:58.869 region:rollup2
AND THAT MAKES IT EVEN MORE

00:58:57.601 --> 00:58:59.736 region:rollup2
COURAGEOUS.

00:58:58.869 --> 00:59:01.671 region:rollup2
BECAUSE SHE KNEW WHAT THE END

00:58:59.736 --> 00:59:03.373 region:rollup2
RESULT WAS GOING TO BE.

00:59:01.671 --> 00:59:04.875 region:rollup2
AND I SAY THAT TO YOU BECAUSE AS

00:59:03.373 --> 00:59:06.810 region:rollup2
YOU THINK ABOUT THE CHALLENGES

00:59:04.875 --> 00:59:08.011 region:rollup2
WE FACE TODAY.

00:59:06.810 --> 00:59:09.679 region:rollup2
AND YOU THINK ABOUT ALL THE

00:59:08.011 --> 00:59:10.213 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT FOLKS TELL US WHY

00:59:09.679 --> 00:59:11.148 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T DO THAT YOU KNOW

00:59:10.213 --> 00:59:12.749 region:rollup2
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

00:59:11.148 --> 00:59:14.418 region:rollup2
THE SAME THING HAPPENED HAPPENED

00:59:12.749 --> 00:59:15.352 region:rollup2
LAST TIME THEY'LL TAKE YOU OFF

00:59:14.418 --> 00:59:16.787 region:rollup2
THE BOOKS ARE GOING TO GIVE YOU

00:59:15.352 --> 00:59:17.654 region:rollup2
A TICKET AND IN NOT GOING TO GET

00:59:16.787 --> 00:59:19.055 region:rollup2
ANY FURTHER AND WAS STILL GOING

00:59:17.654 --> 00:59:20.457 region:rollup2
TO BE IN THE SAME CONDITION. SO

00:59:19.055 --> 00:59:21.658 region:rollup2
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS.

00:59:20.457 --> 00:59:23.593 region:rollup2
AND WE ARE CONFRONTED WITH THAT

00:59:21.658 --> 00:59:25.495 region:rollup2
REALITY AS WE TALK ABOUT CHANGE

00:59:23.593 --> 00:59:26.830 region:rollup2
AND PROGRESS AND PROGRESS OF

00:59:25.495 --> 00:59:27.464 region:rollup2
THINGS IN THIS HOUSE. SO THEY'RE

00:59:26.830 --> 00:59:28.532 region:rollup2
GONNA DO THE SAME THING OVER AND

00:59:27.464 --> 00:59:29.332 region:rollup2
OVER.

00:59:28.532 --> 00:59:31.401 region:rollup2
AND WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT THOSE

00:59:29.332 --> 00:59:33.103 region:rollup2
WHO CONTINUE TO PERSIST.

00:59:31.401 --> 00:59:34.504 region:rollup2
AND YET ROSA PARKS STOOD UP

00:59:33.103 --> 00:59:35.972 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT WAS HER TIME AND HER

00:59:34.504 --> 00:59:37.541 region:rollup2
AND HER PERSISTENCE THAT

00:59:35.972 --> 00:59:40.177 region:rollup2
EVENTUALLY BECAME THE ONE DROP

00:59:37.541 --> 00:59:42.045 region:rollup2
OF WATER THAT CREATED THE FLOOD.

00:59:40.177 --> 00:59:42.979 region:rollup2
SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THAT

00:59:42.045 --> 00:59:45.015 region:rollup2
OFTENTIMES PEOPLE SAY DOCTOR

00:59:42.979 --> 00:59:46.283 region:rollup2
WEBER WHEN WILL YOU GIVE UP.

00:59:45.015 --> 00:59:48.151 region:rollup2
WILL YOU GIVE IN ABOUT THE

00:59:46.283 --> 00:59:49.186 region:rollup2
EDUCATION OF AFRICAN AMERICAN

00:59:48.151 --> 00:59:51.288 region:rollup2
CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA AND THIS

00:59:49.186 --> 00:59:52.222 region:rollup2
NATION.

00:59:51.288 --> 00:59:52.989 region:rollup2
WHEN WILL YOU START TALKING

00:59:52.222 --> 00:59:54.424 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT CLOSING THE

00:59:52.989 --> 00:59:55.959 region:rollup2
ACHIEVEMENT GAP.

00:59:54.424 --> 00:59:59.196 region:rollup2
WHEN WE START TALKING ABOUT STOP

00:59:55.959 --> 00:59:59.196 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY FOR

00:59:59.262 --> 01:00:02.632 region:rollup2
WHEN WILL YOU DO THAT.

01:00:01.631 --> 01:00:04.301 region:rollup2
AND I HAVE TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT

01:00:02.632 --> 01:00:06.436 region:rollup2
I AM THE DAUGHTER OF THE ROSA

01:00:04.301 --> 01:00:08.071 region:rollup2
PARKS OF THE WORLD.

01:00:06.436 --> 01:00:10.373 region:rollup2
I AM THE PERSISTENT KNOCK AT THE

01:00:08.071 --> 01:00:11.875 region:rollup2
DOOR FOR JUSTICE AND EQUALITY.

01:00:10.373 --> 01:00:13.710 region:rollup2
AND YOU SHOULD BE THE ROSA PARKS

01:00:11.875 --> 01:00:15.245 region:rollup2
OF THE WORLD TO.

01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:18.048 region:rollup2
BECAUSE A VISIT RIGHT IF IT IS

01:00:15.245 --> 01:00:19.449 region:rollup2
JUST IT IS OUR TIME TO CONTINUE

01:00:18.048 --> 01:00:20.450 region:rollup2
TO NOT THAT THE DOORS OF

01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:21.985 region:rollup2
INEQUALITY.

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:22.486 region:rollup2
AND IT IS OUR TIME TO DEMAND

01:00:21.985 --> 01:00:24.688 region:rollup2
JUSTICE AND FREEDOM FOR

01:00:22.486 --> 01:00:26.490 region:rollup2
EVERYONE.

01:00:24.688 --> 01:00:27.057 region:rollup2
SO I MIX EXCITED ALWAYS WHEN I

01:00:26.490 --> 01:00:28.291 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE ROSA

01:00:27.057 --> 01:00:29.526 region:rollup2
PARKS.

01:00:28.291 --> 01:00:31.228 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THIS IS A SMALL WOMAN

01:00:29.526 --> 01:00:32.762 region:rollup2
DOING A GREAT THING.

01:00:31.228 --> 01:00:34.231 region:rollup2
AND WE LOOK BACK ON IT NOW AND

01:00:32.762 --> 01:00:35.665 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT WHAT SHE REALLY THAT

01:00:34.231 --> 01:00:36.933 region:rollup2
COURAGEOUS YES SHE WAS.

01:00:35.665 --> 01:00:37.467 region:rollup2
BECAUSE SHE WAS FIGHTING THE

01:00:36.933 --> 01:00:40.270 region:rollup2
MOST POWERFUL FORCE IN THE

01:00:37.467 --> 01:00:41.271 region:rollup2
WORLD.

01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:42.139 region:rollup2
AND THEY COULD HAVE CRUSHED HER

01:00:41.271 --> 01:00:43.240 region:rollup2
AND WE MAY WOULD HAVE NEVER

01:00:42.139 --> 01:00:44.508 region:rollup2
HEARD OF HER AGAIN.

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:45.775 region:rollup2
SIGH I ASKED YOU TO BE THE ROSA

I THINK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I AM.

01:01:00.991 --> 01:01:04.227 region:rollup2
I ALSO STAND ON BEHALF THE LGBT

01:01:02.993 --> 01:01:06.663 region:rollup2
CAUCUS AS WE TALK ABOUT ROSA

01:01:04.227 --> 01:01:07.964 region:rollup2

01:01:06.663 --> 01:01:09.1000 region:rollup2
LIKE DOCTOR WEBER I'M ALSO AN

01:01:07.964 --> 01:01:11.635 region:rollup2
EDUCATOR AND ONE I WOULD STAND

IN FRONT OF MY STUDENTS AND TALK

01:01:11.635 --> 01:01:14.738 region:rollup2
ABOUT SIGNIFICANT PEOPLE I WANT

01:01:13.570 --> 01:01:15.972 region:rollup2
TO KNOW ALSO ABOUT THE CONTEXT

01:01:14.738 --> 01:01:16.973 region:rollup2
OF THEIR LIFE.

01:01:15.972 --> 01:01:18.675 region:rollup2
I WANNA KNOW WHO THEY ARE AS

01:01:16.973 --> 01:01:19.709 region:rollup2
THAT FULL PERSON.

01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:20.310 region:rollup2
SOCIAL WORKERS YOU TO WORK WITH

01:01:19.709 --> 01:01:22.345 region:rollup2
PEOPLE IN THE FULL CONTEXT OF

01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:22.946 region:rollup2
THEIR LIFE.

01:01:22.345 --> 01:01:24.748 region:rollup2
STILL WHEN I THINK ABOUT ROSA

01:01:22.946 --> 01:01:26.716 region:rollup2
PARKS I ALSO THINK ABOUT THE

01:01:24.748 --> 01:01:28.718 region:rollup2
YOUNG GIRL WHO WAS TIED DEEPLY

01:01:26.716 --> 01:01:30.887 region:rollup2
TO HER FAITH WHO FELT WHO FOUND

01:01:28.718 --> 01:01:33.323 region:rollup2
FAITH IN THE A IN THE CHURCH.

01:01:30.887 --> 01:01:34.224 region:rollup2
AND BEGAN ORGANIZING THEIR.

01:01:33.323 --> 01:01:35.358 region:rollup2
I THINK ABOUT THE YOUNG GIRL WHO

01:01:34.224 --> 01:01:36.927 region:rollup2
HAD TO DROP OUT OF SCHOOL A

01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:38.695 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT EARLY BECAUSE SHE HAD

01:01:36.927 --> 01:01:39.596 region:rollup2
TO CARE FOR HER MOTHER AND HER

01:01:38.695 --> 01:01:42.032 region:rollup2
GRANDMOTHER DURING TIMES OF

01:01:39.596 --> 01:01:43.500 region:rollup2
ILLNESS.

01:01:42.032 --> 01:01:45.202 region:rollup2
AND THEN I THINK ABOUT HER

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:46.736 region:rollup2
HAVING A JOB AND GOING AND

01:01:45.202 --> 01:01:49.372 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH AND DOUBLE ACP AND

01:01:46.736 --> 01:01:51.374 region:rollup2
ON THAT DAY ON THAT BUS.

01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:53.009 region:rollup2
SHE SAT BEHIND THE LINE.

01:01:51.374 --> 01:01:54.878 region:rollup2
SHE SAT BEHIND THE LINE THAT

01:01:53.009 --> 01:01:56.646 region:rollup2
SAID BLACKS ONLY.

01:01:54.878 --> 01:01:59.616 region:rollup2
BUT WHEN MORE PEOPLE GOT ON THE

01:01:56.646 --> 01:02:01.218 region:rollup2
BUS MEMBERS THEY MOVED THE LINE.

01:01:59.616 --> 01:02:02.786 region:rollup2
THEY MOVE THE LINE BEFORE HER

01:02:01.218 --> 01:02:04.254 region:rollup2
AND HOW MANY OF US HAVE BEEN IN

01:02:02.786 --> 01:02:05.121 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS WHERE WE THINK WE'VE

01:02:04.254 --> 01:02:08.091 region:rollup2
ACHIEVED WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO

01:02:05.121 --> 01:02:09.893 region:rollup2
BE. AND SOMEBODY MOVES THE LINE.

01:02:08.091 --> 01:02:11.895 region:rollup2
AND AT SOME POINT YOU SAY NO.

01:02:09.893 --> 01:02:14.564 region:rollup2
I WILL NOT CONTINUE TO TAKE THE

01:02:11.895 --> 01:02:16.132 region:rollup2
BACKSEAT WHEN THE LINE IS MOVED

01:02:14.564 --> 01:02:18.034 region:rollup2
AFTER I HAVE DONE EVERYTHING

01:02:16.132 --> 01:02:19.803 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE.

01:02:18.034 --> 01:02:21.805 region:rollup2
AND THEN YOU THINK ABOUT. WHAT

01:02:19.803 --> 01:02:23.773 region:rollup2
WE WERE WE CELEBRATE HER TODAY

01:02:21.805 --> 01:02:25.709 region:rollup2
BUT AT THAT TIME BECAUSE SHE WAS

01:02:23.773 --> 01:02:27.077 region:rollup2
A WOMAN? HER VOICE WASN'T REALLY

01:02:25.709 --> 01:02:28.445 region:rollup2
HEARD.

01:02:27.077 --> 01:02:30.046 region:rollup2
WHEN A STANDING OVATION WAS

01:02:28.445 --> 01:02:31.448 region:rollup2
CREATED WHEN SHE WALKED INTO A

01:02:30.046 --> 01:02:33.350 region:rollup2
ROOM AFTER IN SHE SAID SHOULD I

01:02:31.448 --> 01:02:34.884 region:rollup2
SPEAK.

01:02:33.350 --> 01:02:36.119 region:rollup2
AND THE MEN WHO WORK AT WHO WERE

01:02:34.884 --> 01:02:38.255 region:rollup2
WONDERFUL ACTIVISTS SAID YOU'VE

01:02:36.119 --> 01:02:39.556 region:rollup2
SAID ENOUGH.

01:02:38.255 --> 01:02:41.191 region:rollup2
AND SO AFTER THAT SHE WAS FIRED

01:02:39.556 --> 01:02:42.258 region:rollup2
FROM HER JOB.

01:02:41.191 --> 01:02:44.227 region:rollup2
WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT SHE WAS

01:02:42.258 --> 01:02:46.463 region:rollup2
FIRED FROM HER JOB WE KNOW

01:02:44.227 --> 01:02:48.131 region:rollup2
PEOPLE NOW WHO SPEAK OUT AND

01:02:46.463 --> 01:02:49.232 region:rollup2
FACED SEVERE RETALIATION.

01:02:48.131 --> 01:02:51.668 region:rollup2
AND NEVERTHELESS

01:02:49.232 --> 01:02:52.235 region:rollup2
SHE PERSISTED.

01:02:51.668 --> 01:02:54.304 region:rollup2
HER HUSBAND WAS GIVEN DEATH

01:02:52.235 --> 01:02:56.072 region:rollup2
THREATS.

01:02:54.304 --> 01:02:57.507 region:rollup2
SO EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS AN ICON

01:02:56.072 --> 01:02:59.376 region:rollup2
OF THE SOUTH IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS

01:02:57.507 --> 01:03:00.477 region:rollup2
MOVEMENT. SHE HAD MOVED NORTH

01:02:59.376 --> 01:03:02.912 region:rollup2
LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHERE THERE

01:03:00.477 --> 01:03:03.513 region:rollup2
WAS MORE OPPORTUNITY.

01:03:02.912 --> 01:03:04.848 region:rollup2
WHEN SHE RETURNED TO SCHOOL AT

01:03:03.513 --> 01:03:06.650 region:rollup2
THAT TIME.

01:03:04.848 --> 01:03:08.318 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED A BIGGER EDUCATION.

01:03:06.650 --> 01:03:10.620 region:rollup2
AND THEN AT THAT TIME WENT TO

01:03:08.318 --> 01:03:12.756 region:rollup2
WORK FOR AN ELECTED OFFICIAL.

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:14.224 region:rollup2
REACH BACK TO THE SOUTH.

01:03:12.756 --> 01:03:16.660 region:rollup2
A BUILDER A NETWORK IN IN

01:03:14.224 --> 01:03:18.461 region:rollup2
DETROIT.

01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:20.063 region:rollup2
AT THAT TIME BEING THE FIRST AT

01:03:18.461 --> 01:03:21.698 region:rollup2
JOHN CONNORS FIRST AFRICAN

01:03:20.063 --> 01:03:23.633 region:rollup2
AMERICAN ELECTED TO CONGRESS.

01:03:21.698 --> 01:03:25.568 region:rollup2
AND SHE WAS ITS FIRST SECRETARY

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:26.603 region:rollup2
EVEN THOUGH HE HAD OPINIONS THAT

01:03:25.568 --> 01:03:28.004 region:rollup2
SAID WOMEN SHOULDN'T BE IN THE

01:03:26.603 --> 01:03:29.072 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE.

01:03:28.004 --> 01:03:30.473 region:rollup2
BUT HE KNEW SHE WAS THE BEST

01:03:29.072 --> 01:03:32.175 region:rollup2
SECRETARY AROUND IS THAT HE MADE

01:03:30.473 --> 01:03:33.476 region:rollup2
THAT EXCEPTION.

01:03:32.175 --> 01:03:36.646 region:rollup2
PERSISTED SHE MAY CHANGE

01:03:33.476 --> 01:03:37.947 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T STOP.

01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:39.215 region:rollup2
SHE HAD LEAVE AGAIN.

01:03:37.947 --> 01:03:41.251 region:rollup2
TO CARE FOR HER MOTHER. AND HER

01:03:39.215 --> 01:03:42.485 region:rollup2
HUSBAND.

01:03:41.251 --> 01:03:44.788 region:rollup2
AS A LOT OF WOMEN WHO HAVE

01:03:42.485 --> 01:03:46.423 region:rollup2
BECOME CARETAKERS CAREGIVERS.

01:03:44.788 --> 01:03:47.157 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE LOOK AROUND

01:03:46.423 --> 01:03:48.258 region:rollup2
WHO'S GOING TO CARE FOR OUR

01:03:47.157 --> 01:03:49.759 region:rollup2
SENIORS WHO'S GOING TO CARE FOR

01:03:48.258 --> 01:03:51.094 region:rollup2
OUR LOVED ONES.

01:03:49.759 --> 01:03:53.296 region:rollup2
IT WAS ALSO PEOPLE LIKE ROSA

01:03:51.094 --> 01:03:54.331 region:rollup2
PARKS LIVING EVERYDAY LIVES

01:03:53.296 --> 01:03:57.100 region:rollup2
DOING THE RIGHT THING EVERY

01:03:54.331 --> 01:03:58.902 region:rollup2
SINGLE DAY.

01:03:57.100 --> 01:04:00.870 region:rollup2
AFTER SHE WAS A SENIOR SHE WAS

01:03:58.902 --> 01:04:01.971 region:rollup2
LIVING ALONE THEIR OWN HOME. AND

01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:03.673 region:rollup2
LIKE A WOMAN IN THE OWN

01:04:01.971 --> 01:04:05.575 region:rollup2
SOUTHSIDE STOCK IN A JUST

01:04:03.673 --> 01:04:06.509 region:rollup2
OCCURRED IN MY DISTRICT.

01:04:05.575 --> 01:04:08.078 region:rollup2
SHE WAS ASSAULTED. BY A YOUNG

01:04:06.509 --> 01:04:09.279 region:rollup2
PERSON.

01:04:08.078 --> 01:04:11.081 region:rollup2
PULLING HER INTO THINKING HE WAS

01:04:09.279 --> 01:04:12.182 region:rollup2
TRYING TO HELP.

01:04:11.081 --> 01:04:13.483 region:rollup2
SHE WAS ASSAULTED WHEN SHE WAS

01:04:12.182 --> 01:04:15.118 region:rollup2
IN HER LATE SEVENTIES LIVING

01:04:13.483 --> 01:04:17.287 region:rollup2
ALONE INDEPENDENTLY IN DETROIT

01:04:15.118 --> 01:04:17.887 region:rollup2
AND AT THAT TIME THEN WAS MOVED

01:04:17.287 --> 01:04:19.556 region:rollup2
INTO INTO A DIFFERENT KIND OF

01:04:17.887 --> 01:04:21.191 region:rollup2
HOUSING.

01:04:19.556 --> 01:04:23.059 region:rollup2
SO WHILE SHE DID THIS ONE GREAT

01:04:21.191 --> 01:04:24.461 region:rollup2
THING THAT WE ALL REMEMBER.

01:04:23.059 --> 01:04:27.397 region:rollup2
LET US NEVER FORGET THE FULL

01:04:24.461 --> 01:04:29.499 region:rollup2
LIFE SHE LIVED THAT IS SYMBOLIC

01:04:27.397 --> 01:04:30.834 region:rollup2
OF THE STRUGGLES WE STILL FACE

01:04:29.499 --> 01:04:33.370 region:rollup2
IF YOU ARE AN AFRICAN AMERICAN.

01:04:30.834 --> 01:04:35.205 region:rollup2
IF YOU'RE A WOMAN.

01:04:33.370 --> 01:04:36.873 region:rollup2
ALL OF THESE THINGS AND THEN

01:04:35.205 --> 01:04:39.376 region:rollup2

IF THEY LOSE.

01:15:01.630 --> 01:15:04.433 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE PAID ALMOST HALF OF

THEY'VE WOMEN'S SOCCER PRODUCES

01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:17.980 region:rollup2
MORE REVENUE THEY HAVE SOARED

01:15:16.045 --> 01:15:20.016 region:rollup2
PAST THE MEN'S SOCCER LEAGUE FOR

01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:21.250 region:rollup2
THE SOCCER LEAGUE THEN THEN THE

01:15:20.016 --> 01:15:23.219 region:rollup2
MEN'S TEAM DOES I WANT THE MEN

01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:24.987 region:rollup2
TO DO WELL BUT. THE WOMEN ARE

01:15:23.219 --> 01:15:26.522 region:rollup2
REALLY TAKING OFF THEY ARE

01:15:24.987 --> 01:15:28.591 region:rollup2
CHAMPIONS ACROSS THE WORLD THEIR

01:15:26.522 --> 01:15:30.326 region:rollup2
RECORD IS THAT THEY HAVE WON

01:15:28.591 --> 01:15:32.862 region:rollup2

NINETEEN NINETY SIX.

01:15:32.862 --> 01:15:36.599 region:rollup2
AND THEY MAKE LESS THAN THE MEN.

01:15:34.930 --> 01:15:39.268 region:rollup2
AND THEY GET LOWER TRAVELING

01:15:36.599 --> 01:15:40.669 region:rollup2
ALLOWANCES.

01:15:39.268 --> 01:15:42.438 region:rollup2
LESS EXPENSIVE OR LESS A FOR

EXHIBITION GAMES. AND.

01:15:47.777 --> 01:15:51.614 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT JUST SOCCER BY THE WAY

01:15:50.079 --> 01:15:53.916 region:rollup2
WHERE THIS IS HAPPENING THE

01:15:51.614 --> 01:15:55.084 region:rollup2
GENDER WAGE GAP IS GROWING IT'S

01:15:53.916 --> 01:15:56.752 region:rollup2
NOT GETTING BETTER IT'S GROWING

01:15:55.084 --> 01:15:58.487 region:rollup2
IN PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL. AND

01:15:56.752 --> 01:15:59.021 region:rollup2
PRIZE MONEY IN PROFESSIONAL GOLF

01:15:58.487 --> 01:16:00.689 region:rollup2
CHAMPIONSHIPS IS LOWER FOR

01:15:59.021 --> 01:16:02.324 region:rollup2
WOMEN.

01:16:00.689 --> 01:16:04.193 region:rollup2
AND WOMEN ARE SHORT CHANGED EVEN

01:16:02.324 --> 01:16:06.228 region:rollup2
AT THE COLLEGE LEVEL. THE NCAA

01:16:04.193 --> 01:16:07.263 region:rollup2

IT AWARDS NOTHING FOR WOMEN.

01:16:12.101 --> 01:16:15.838 region:rollup2
AND SO IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE

01:16:14.236 --> 01:16:17.373 region:rollup2
THAT WOMEN ARE WINNING MORE

01:16:15.838 --> 01:16:18.774 region:rollup2
GAMES THEY'RE PLAYING MORE GAMES

01:16:17.373 --> 01:16:20.576 region:rollup2
THEY'RE EARNING MORE FOR THEIR

01:16:18.774 --> 01:16:22.244 region:rollup2
SPORTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND

01:16:20.576 --> 01:16:23.979 region:rollup2
THEY'RE PAID LESS TO WIN. THAN

01:16:22.244 --> 01:16:25.281 region:rollup2
MEN WHEN THEY LOSE.

01:16:23.979 --> 01:16:26.782 region:rollup2
THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO

01:16:25.281 --> 01:16:27.983 region:rollup2
