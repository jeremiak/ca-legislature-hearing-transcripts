THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS- I RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS AN UNUSUAL TO PRESENT- THIS THIS BILL DOES MOMENT- BUT I WANT TO. THANK YOU FOR AT THE TIME TO A PRESENT ON AN IMPORTANT MATTER. AS YOU KNOW WESTERN STATES ARE FOR YOU SEEN A MEGA DROUGHT. AND NOW MORE THAN EVER WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE INVEST IN WATER INFRASTRUCTURE. FIRST FIRST AND FOREMOST I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARE CALDERON FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS MEASURE BUT- I ALSO WANT TO. SPEAK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS BILL IN THE PAST THE LEGISLATURE HAS MADE WISE DECISIONS TO INVEST IN REPAIRING OUR- CRUMBLING HIGH RISK INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING THE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN- APPROPRIATION OF OVER ONE BILLION. FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE NEW BAY BRIDGE BETWEEN THE SAN FRANCISCO AND OAKLAND. DESPITE THE AT THE- UNDER% ESTIMATED COSTS THE STATE MOVE FORWARD WITH THE PROJECT BECAUSE AS ONE OF THE MOST HEAVILY TRAVELED BRIDGES IN OUR STATE. IT WAS NECESSARY TO REPAIR AND PROVIDED A NET BENEFIT FOR THE ENTIRE STATE TO DO SO. AN INVESTMENT IN OUR FAMILY WATER DELIVERY SYSTEM IS NO LESS IMPORTANT TO OUR STATE AND TO ALL OF US THAT LIVE HERE. WE GROW CROPS THAT FEED THE WORLD. BUT THIS IS NOT JUST FOR AGRICULTURE THE WATER IS USED BY RESIDENTS IN RURAL COMMUNITIES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND URBAN USERS IN LOS ANGELES. ABOUT THIRTY ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS THOUGH THIS BILL ISN'T JUST ABOUT AGRICULTURE LET'S NOT DISCOUNT THE IMPACT THIS LEGISLATION WILL HAVE ON OUR AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY I'VE THEIR FARMING CONTRIBUTES FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS TO CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY EVERY YEAR AND THAT'S WITHOUT ACCOUNTING. FOR THE ECONOMIC IMPACT ON FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES ALL OVER THE STATE. IN CALIFORNIA WE RECOGNIZE OUR STRATEGIC ADVANTAGES IN CERTAIN INDUSTRIES AND HAVE ACTED TO ENSURE THAT THEY STAY STRONG- SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN LEGISLATURE HAS ALLOCATED ONE. POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS TO FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS TO ENSURE THOSE PRODUCTION STAY HERE. THAT'S THREE HUNDRED AND- THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND I SUPPORT IT WE NEED THOSE JOBS IN OUR STATE. BUT JUST LIKE HOLLYWOOD CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY IS A WORLD LEADER THREE OF OUR FOUR LARGEST AGRICULTURE PRODUCING COUNTIES IN THE UNITED STATES ARE IN MY SENATE DISTRICT WE NEED THE JOBS THIS INDUSTRY SUPPORTS. TO AND MORE IMPORTANTLY. CALIFORNIA NEEDS THE FOOD. THAT THIS INDUSTRY PRODUCES. THE NATION THAT AT NEEDS THIS FOOD.

THANK YOU GOOD MORNING OF ON MY CLIENT PROJECT OF QUALITY BOTTOM LINE CALIFORNIA A DEPUTY TODAY AND QUICKLY STAFFORD CONVENIENT THE CONVERSATION CAN TAKE ORDERS ON THE BAIL- AUDUBON CONCERNS REALLY ARE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH THOSE THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE COMMITTEE STAFF REQUIRED- WE THINK THAT SB FIVE FIVE NINE CAN BE AMENDED SUPPORT PROPER CARE WHILE ALSO PROMOTING PUBLIC BENEFITS. PROVIDING OVERSIGHT AND IN SHARING THEIR ABILITY TO STATE INVESTMENT. NOW WE KNOW THAT THE PROPOSED- COMPANION FEDERAL LEGISLATION WILL BECOME A MORE DETAILED ANOTHER ELEMENT. AND A QUIET COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. BUT WE ALSO WANT TO BE CLEAR AND WE HAD LOTS OF PROFIT WE KNOW THE TELLING OF THAT NEED TO BE REPAIRED THE COMPETITION AND PROMPT MANNER- AND THERE NEEDS TO BE PUBLIC FUNDS. THE LOTS OF COMPLAINTS HAD REAL CONSEQUENCES FOR PEOPLE AND FARMS AND FUNDING FOR THE DRINKING WATER SUPPLY. NOT BECAUSE FIVE FIVE NINE DOESN'T REQUIRE. A DEMONSTRATION OF MEDICAL BENEFITS EIGHT LOCAL WATER ON OUT TO LEFT THE PATH IS A MY OKAY CAN DANCE IS TO IMPROVE AND OTHER BENEFITS SUCH AS PROVIDING SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER YEAH FOR THE ENVIRONMENT THAT THAT'S WHAT WE ALL WANT TO KNOW THE BILL LACK LANGUAGE TO ENSURE AN ADEQUATE CAUGHT A COST SHARE FOR PRIVATE BENEFICIARY- ESPECIALLY IT DOES NOT REQUIRE THE PRIVATE PARTY TO THE RESPONSIBLE TO HISTORIC AND ONGOING OVERDRAFT. IF I JUST BE IDENTIFIED AND WHERE APPROPRIATE THAT THEY CONTRIBUTE ACOSTA THE REPAIRS. THAT FIVE FIVE NINE THIS IS NOT A FIVE EIGHT I'D BETTER FIND COLLECTING COMITATO PARTY. BECAUSE PUBLIC TAX DOLLARS FILL THE VOID. HI REISSUE THE SPECIALLY PRESENTLY HAVE A CRACKING I SHOULD SAY BECAUSE FIND AT THE KILLING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN ELEMENTS FROM THE POPULAR PARTY. THAT ITS STATE WILL REDUCE THE COST HAVE A PRIVATE LOCAL BENEFICIARIES.
