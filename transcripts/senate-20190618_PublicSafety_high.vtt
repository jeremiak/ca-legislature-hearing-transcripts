00:36:33.758 --> 00:36:35.092
WE TIGHTENED THE BILL IN

00:36:35.159 --> 00:36:36.694
ASSEMBLY PUBLIC SAFETY SO THAT

00:36:36.761 --> 00:36:39.297
THERE'S A SET -- CODIFICATION

00:36:39.363 --> 00:36:41.232
AROUND HOW MUCH INTERACTION THE

00:36:41.299 --> 00:36:42.800
INDIVIDUALS I HAD BEFORE THE

00:36:42.867 --> 00:36:44.335
ISSUE A GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING

00:36:44.402 --> 00:36:45.136
ORDERS.

00:36:45.202 --> 00:36:46.904
AS YOU KNOW -- EVERYBODY HAS A

00:36:46.971 --> 00:36:48.940
RIGHT TO GO TO SCHOOL AND TO

00:36:49.006 --> 00:36:51.442
WORK WITHOUT FEARING FOR THEIR

00:36:51.509 --> 00:36:52.843
LIFE WE THINK THIS IS A TOOL.

00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:55.780
THAT THOSE FOLKS CAN USE IN

00:36:55.846 --> 00:36:57.148
THESE TYPES OF SITUATIONS AND

00:36:57.214 --> 00:36:58.382
UNFORTUNATELY SEEN WAY TOO MANY

00:36:58.449 --> 00:36:59.884
MASS SHOOTINGS OCCUR IN

00:36:59.951 --> 00:37:02.320
WORKPLACES AS WELL AS SCHOOLS.

00:37:02.386 --> 00:37:03.588
SO WITH THAT WERE RESPECTFULLY

00:37:03.654 --> 00:37:09.126
ASKING FOR YOUR VOTE ON A. B..

00:37:09.193 --> 00:37:09.694
SIXTY ONE RIGHT WITNESSES IN

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:10.761
SUPPORT.

00:37:10.828 --> 00:37:12.129
CALVIN CREEK ON BEHALF OF BAY

00:37:12.196 --> 00:37:13.831
AREA STUDENT ACTIVISTS -- WERE

00:37:13.898 --> 00:37:14.865
WE ARE IN SUPPORT AND SO I THINK

00:37:14.932 --> 00:37:17.268
MY FIRST POINT IS THAT.

00:37:17.335 --> 00:37:19.470
COM I PERSONALLY KNOW AS A

00:37:19.537 --> 00:37:22.306
STUDENT THAT MANY PEOPLE SEE

00:37:22.373 --> 00:37:25.710
THEIR TEACHERS OR OTHERWISE

00:37:25.776 --> 00:37:26.944
THEIR CO WORKERS THEIR EMPLOYER.

00:37:27.011 --> 00:37:29.580
A LOT MORE SOMETIMES THAN THE TO

00:37:29.647 --> 00:37:31.182
THEIR FAMILY ESPECIALLY IF THEY

00:37:31.248 --> 00:37:33.517
HAVE A DIFFICULT SITUATION.

00:37:33.584 --> 00:37:36.887
AT HOME AND SO THOSE PEOPLE

00:37:36.954 --> 00:37:37.855
SOMETIMES NO BETTER THAN A

00:37:37.922 --> 00:37:39.423
FAMILY WHEN THAT PERSON IS AT

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:41.025
RISK WHEN THEY CAN FEEL

00:37:41.092 --> 00:37:42.660
THREATENED WHEN THEY'RE ACTING

00:37:42.727 --> 00:37:44.929
ERRATICALLY FOR EXAMPLE -- AND

00:37:44.996 --> 00:37:47.999
IS ONE EXAMPLE OF COURSE -- I

00:37:48.065 --> 00:37:49.533
BRING THIS UP EVERY TIME WE TALK

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:51.102
ABOUT THIS BILL IS THAT AT THE

00:37:51.168 --> 00:37:53.204
PARKING SHOOTING FRIENDS AND

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:55.006
TEACHERS KNEW THE SHOOTER HAD AN

00:37:55.072 --> 00:37:56.774
OBSESSION WITH GUNS.

00:37:56.841 --> 00:37:58.843
THAT THE SHOOTER HELD RACIST

00:37:58.909 --> 00:38:00.411
HOMOPHOBIC ANTI SEMITIC AND

00:38:00.478 --> 00:38:02.246
XENOPHOBIC VIEWS.

00:38:02.313 --> 00:38:03.781
AND HAD EVEN STATED.

00:38:03.848 --> 00:38:06.183
BEFORE THE ATTACK I AM GOING TO

00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:09.086
BE A PROFESSIONAL SCHOOL FUTURE.

00:38:09.153 --> 00:38:11.789
AND SO LAW ENFORCEMENT FAILED TO

00:38:11.856 --> 00:38:15.059
ACT TO MOVE HIS GUNS THE FROM

00:38:15.126 --> 00:38:18.529
HIS POSSESSION.

00:38:18.596 --> 00:38:21.499
AND YET -- IF HIS TEACHERS WHO

00:38:21.565 --> 00:38:22.633
KNEW HIM HAD BEEN ABLE TO

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:24.568
PETITION THE COURT. FOR HIS GUNS

00:38:24.635 --> 00:38:25.102
BECAUSE THIS CREATED THAT

00:38:25.169 --> 00:38:28.372
TRAGEDY MIGHT HAVE BEEN AVERTED.

00:38:28.439 --> 00:38:31.208
AND I THINK IT'S ALSO BEEN THE

00:38:31.275 --> 00:38:32.476
THERE ARE OTHER EXAMPLES THE

00:38:32.543 --> 00:38:34.445
SHOOTING EARLIER THIS YEAR IN

00:38:34.512 --> 00:38:35.279
AURORA.

00:38:35.346 --> 00:38:36.647
ILLINOIS IS ANOTHER ONE WHERE

00:38:36.714 --> 00:38:40.284
BACKGROUND CHECKS FAILED AND

00:38:40.351 --> 00:38:41.919
THAN EMPLOYEE WHO HAD JUST BEEN

00:38:41.986 --> 00:38:44.388
DISMISSED -- PULLED OUT A GUN IN

00:38:44.455 --> 00:38:45.589
HIS WORKPLACE.

00:38:45.656 --> 00:38:47.024
AND SHOT FIVE PEOPLE.

00:38:47.091 --> 00:38:48.959
AND SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:38:49.026 --> 00:38:51.762
REMEMBER THAT OVER FIVE HUNDRED

00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:53.631
WORKPLACE HOMICIDES OCCUR EVERY

00:38:53.698 --> 00:38:56.233
YEAR AND FIREARMS ARE USED IN

00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:58.436
80%.

00:38:58.502 --> 00:39:00.137
OF THOSE CASES.

00:39:00.204 --> 00:39:00.905
AND THAT MIGHT MY SECOND POINT

00:39:00.971 --> 00:39:02.006
IS THAT [inaudible]

00:39:02.073 --> 00:39:04.642
PHONE.

00:39:04.709 --> 00:39:06.811
HELLO THE BIGGEST CAUSE OF GUN

00:39:06.877 --> 00:39:09.947
BY OF GUN DEATHS IN THIS -- IN

00:39:10.014 --> 00:39:12.750
THIS COUNTRY IS SUICIDE OVER TWO

00:39:12.817 --> 00:39:13.350
THIRDS OF ALL COME WITH A TO

00:39:13.417 --> 00:39:16.120
DEATH ARE SUICIDES -- WITH OVER

00:39:16.187 --> 00:39:18.622
THOUSANDS OF THOSE BY CHILDREN

00:39:18.689 --> 00:39:19.990
AND TEENS EVERY YEAR.

00:39:20.057 --> 00:39:22.259
AND WHILE WELL OVER 90% OF

00:39:22.326 --> 00:39:23.027
SUICIDE ATTEMPTS ARE

00:39:23.094 --> 00:39:25.196
UNSUCCESSFUL WHEN THE MEASURE

00:39:25.262 --> 00:39:28.132
THAT DOES NOT INVOLVE A FIREARM.

00:39:28.199 --> 00:39:30.334
85% OF SUICIDES ATTEMPTS USING A

00:39:30.401 --> 00:39:34.505
FIREARM RESULT IN DEATH.

00:39:34.572 --> 00:39:36.340
GUNS FACILITATE SUICIDE AND IT

00:39:36.407 --> 00:39:38.542
STANDS TO REASON THEN THAT IT HE

00:39:38.609 --> 00:39:40.177
WAY TO PREVENT SUICIDES IS TO

00:39:40.244 --> 00:39:41.812
MAKE SURE THAT A SUICIDAL PERSON

00:39:41.879 --> 00:39:43.214
DOES NOT HAVE A GUN.

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:46.450
AT THEIR DISPOSAL SUICIDAL

00:39:46.517 --> 00:39:47.952
PEOPLE NEEDED HELP.

00:39:48.018 --> 00:39:48.786
NEED HELP TO FEEL THAT THEY HAVE

00:39:48.853 --> 00:39:50.154
A PURPOSE IN THE WORLD THEY NEED

00:39:50.221 --> 00:39:51.756
THEIR FAMILY THEIR CO WORKERS

00:39:51.822 --> 00:39:53.524
THE TEACHERS TO SPEAK UP AND TO

00:39:53.591 --> 00:39:55.059
ACTIVELY GET INVOLVED.

00:39:55.126 --> 00:39:58.763
IN ORDER TO PROTECT THEIR LIVES

00:39:58.829 --> 00:39:59.063
[inaudible]

00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:00.297
AND SO.

00:40:00.364 --> 00:40:01.298
AGAIN WHILE LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:40:01.365 --> 00:40:03.467
AGENCIES AROUND THE STATE

THERE ARE OTHER BILLS TO ADDRESS

00:40:11.075 --> 00:40:13.077
THAT BUT WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS

00:40:13.144 --> 00:40:14.345
ESSENTIAL THAT EMPLOYERS CO

00:40:14.411 --> 00:40:16.180
WORKERS AND TEACHERS PEOPLE TO

00:40:16.247 --> 00:40:18.582

RED.

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:56.947
GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND

00:41:57.014 --> 00:41:58.983
MEMBERS KATHY SURE FOR THE ACLU

00:41:59.049 --> 00:42:00.384
OF CALIFORNIA.

00:42:00.451 --> 00:42:02.119
AB SIXTY ONE SIGNIFICANTLY

00:42:02.186 --> 00:42:03.621
EXPANDS THE CLASS OF PEOPLE WHO

00:42:03.687 --> 00:42:05.589
ARE AUTHORIZED TO SEEK EX PARTE

00:42:05.656 --> 00:42:07.124
GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS

00:42:07.191 --> 00:42:08.726
AND WE REMAIN CONCERNED THAT

00:42:08.792 --> 00:42:09.960
THIS WILL MAKE THE SYSTEM PRONE

00:42:10.027 --> 00:42:11.829
TO ABUSE.

00:42:11.896 --> 00:42:13.197
THE AMENDMENTS REQUIRE THAT IF A

00:42:13.264 --> 00:42:14.798
CO WORKERS PETITIONING FOR A G.

00:42:14.865 --> 00:42:16.200
B. RO THEY MUST HAVE HAD

00:42:16.267 --> 00:42:17.701
SUBSTANTIAL INTERACTIONS WITH

00:42:17.768 --> 00:42:19.536
THE PERSON THEY MUST HAVE THE

00:42:19.603 --> 00:42:20.804
APPROVAL OF THE EMPLOYER.

00:42:20.871 --> 00:42:22.306
BUT THIS DOES LITTLE TO PREVENT

00:42:22.373 --> 00:42:23.741
SOMEONE FROM ACTING OUT OF

00:42:23.807 --> 00:42:26.076
IRRATIONAL FEARS OR BIASED DUE

00:42:26.143 --> 00:42:27.745
TO A CO WORKERS RACE OR RELIGION

00:42:27.811 --> 00:42:30.481
OR NATURAL NATIONAL ORIGIN OR

00:42:30.547 --> 00:42:31.882
FROM RETALIATION.

00:42:31.949 --> 00:42:33.284
BECAUSE JUST AS THE CO WORKER

00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:35.085
MIGHT BE ACTING OUT OF BIAS AN

00:42:35.152 --> 00:42:37.922
EMPLOYER MIGHT WORK SIGN OFF ON

00:42:37.988 --> 00:42:40.157
SUCH A REQUEST OUT OF BIAS --

00:42:40.224 --> 00:42:42.126
THE BILL ALSO AS AMENDED ALSO

00:42:42.192 --> 00:42:43.127
REQUIRES THAT IF A SCHOOL

00:42:43.193 --> 00:42:44.662
EMPLOYEE IS PETITIONING FOR A G.

00:42:44.728 --> 00:42:47.298
B. R. O. THEY OBTAIN APPROVAL OF

00:42:47.364 --> 00:42:48.799
THIS SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION. FOR

00:42:48.866 --> 00:42:50.301
SIMILAR REASONS THIS DOES LITTLE

00:42:50.367 --> 00:42:51.268
TO ADDRESS THE CONCERN THE

00:42:51.335 --> 00:42:53.270
PETITIONS WILL BE FILED IN A

00:42:53.337 --> 00:42:54.939
DISCRIMINATORY MANNER.

00:42:55.005 --> 00:42:55.739
ADDITIONALLY THE PROJECT

00:42:55.806 --> 00:42:57.508
RATIONALE FOR AN EX PARTE ORDER

00:42:57.574 --> 00:42:58.976
IS THE ALLEGED URGENCY OF THE

00:42:59.043 --> 00:43:00.644
THREAT YET THIS BILL ALLOWS A

00:43:00.711 --> 00:43:02.146
SCHOOL EMPLOYEE TO SEEK AN EX

00:43:02.212 --> 00:43:03.580
PARTE ORDER EVEN IF THEY HAVEN'T

00:43:03.647 --> 00:43:05.916
SEEN THE STUDENT FOR SIX MONTHS.

00:43:05.983 --> 00:43:07.651
THIS TIME FRAME IS INCONSISTENT

00:43:07.718 --> 00:43:09.286
WITH THE SUPPOSED URGENCY OF THE

00:43:09.353 --> 00:43:10.321
ORDER.

00:43:10.387 --> 00:43:12.022
WHEN SOMEONE IS SUBJECT TO AN EX

00:43:12.089 --> 00:43:13.891
PARTE ORDER THEY DO NOT HAVE AN

00:43:13.958 --> 00:43:15.626
OPPORTUNITY TO DEFEND THEMSELVES

00:43:15.693 --> 00:43:17.661
OR PRESENT THEIR SIDE BEFORE THE

00:43:17.728 --> 00:43:18.963
ORDER IS CRACKED CARRIED OUT?

00:43:19.029 --> 00:43:20.497
THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT A G.

00:43:20.564 --> 00:43:22.299
B. R. O. HAS BEEN APPROVED UNTIL

00:43:22.366 --> 00:43:23.300
AN OFFICER SHOWS UP AT THEIR

02:03:35.274 --> 02:03:37.643
PAIN OVER AND OVER AGAIN -- IN

02:03:37.710 --> 02:03:39.211
THE NAME OF MAKING POSITIVE

02:03:39.278 --> 02:03:44.750
CHANGES IN CALIFORNIA SO I'M

02:03:44.817 --> 02:03:47.486
HAPPY.

02:03:47.553 --> 02:03:50.122
TO I SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY.

02:03:50.189 --> 02:03:52.124
BETTER BRADFORD THANK YOU MADAM

02:03:52.191 --> 02:03:54.193
CHAIR AND I TO WANNA CALL THE

02:03:54.260 --> 02:03:55.928
SENTIMENTS OF MUCH WHAT MY

02:03:55.995 --> 02:03:57.530
COLLEAGUES HERE AT THE MOMENT

02:03:57.596 --> 02:03:59.064
MOST IMPORTANTLY WHAT.

02:03:59.131 --> 02:04:01.133
THE WITNESSES HAVE SAID TODAY

02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:02.835
AND WHAT YOU SAID -- REALIZE

02:04:02.902 --> 02:04:05.805
YEAR. TO BRING THIS MEASURE

02:04:05.871 --> 02:04:07.273
FORWARD AND TO THE TREMENDOUS

02:04:07.339 --> 02:04:08.774
COURAGE THAT DOCTOR WEBER HAS

02:04:08.841 --> 02:04:10.676
SHOWN AND I'M HONORED TO BE.

02:04:10.743 --> 02:04:12.077
A CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL.

02:04:12.144 --> 02:04:14.079
BUT I MOVED TO THE FACT THAT.

02:04:14.146 --> 02:04:15.080
WE REALLY DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM

02:04:15.147 --> 02:04:17.616
WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THIS

02:04:17.683 --> 02:04:18.217
COUNTRY WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH

02:04:18.284 --> 02:04:18.918
RACE.

02:04:18.984 --> 02:04:21.020
AND THAT'S AT THE CORE OF WHY

02:04:21.086 --> 02:04:22.721
WE'RE HERE TODAY.

02:04:22.788 --> 02:04:24.356
BECAUSE OF WE UNDERSTAND THE

02:04:24.423 --> 02:04:25.057
ORIGIN.

02:04:25.124 --> 02:04:28.160
OF THE USE OF DEADLY FORCE IN

02:04:28.227 --> 02:04:28.794
EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO IT WAS IN

02:04:28.861 --> 02:04:32.698
DIRECT RESPONSE TO FREE AFRICANS

02:04:32.765 --> 02:04:34.366
AND IN THIS COUNTRY.

02:04:34.433 --> 02:04:35.701
IT WAS NO GREATER THREAT TO LAW

02:04:35.768 --> 02:04:38.537
ENFORCEMENT IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY

02:04:38.604 --> 02:04:39.638
TWO THEN IT WAS.

02:04:39.705 --> 02:04:41.006
IN.

02:04:41.073 --> 02:04:41.640
SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SIX THE ONLY

02:04:41.707 --> 02:04:44.210
DIFFERENCE WAS BLOCKS WERE FREE

02:04:44.276 --> 02:04:45.277
AND THIS WAS A WAY OF

02:04:45.344 --> 02:04:47.313
SUPPRESSING PEOPLE AND WE'VE

02:04:47.379 --> 02:04:49.615
SEEN THROUGHOUT HISTORY WHETHER

02:04:49.682 --> 02:04:51.083
IT'S AN OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM

02:04:51.150 --> 02:04:52.718
WHETHER IT'S IN OUR HOUSING

02:04:52.785 --> 02:04:54.220
WHETHER TíNH JOBS IN OUR

02:04:54.286 --> 02:04:56.522
EDUCATION SYSTEM.

02:04:56.589 --> 02:04:57.990
RACE IS ALWAYS THE COURT AND IT

02:04:58.057 --> 02:04:59.124
DEMONSTRATES ITSELF MORE IN

02:04:59.191 --> 02:05:01.060
POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY AND WE

02:05:01.126 --> 02:05:03.362
SEE IT HERE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT.

02:05:03.429 --> 02:05:04.730
AT I GREW UP IN A WHITE

02:05:04.797 --> 02:05:06.031
COMMUNITY AND I SAW THE

02:05:06.098 --> 02:05:07.766
INTERACTION THAT WAS DIFFERENT

02:05:07.833 --> 02:05:09.368
BETWEEN MY WIFE FRANCE WHEN IT

02:05:09.435 --> 02:05:11.303
CAME LAW ENFORCEMENT AND WHEN IT

02:05:11.370 --> 02:05:13.672
CAME TO PEOPLE THAT LOOK LIKEME.

02:05:13.739 --> 02:05:14.773
AND IT WAS A STARK DIFFERENCE

02:05:14.840 --> 02:05:19.511
AND I REMEMBER A HEARING WE HAD.

02:05:19.578 --> 02:05:20.846
AN ASSEMBLY WHEN I CHAIR TO SLOT

02:05:20.913 --> 02:05:21.447
COMMITTEE ON BOYS AND MEN OF

02:05:21.513 --> 02:05:24.583
COLOR.

02:05:24.650 --> 02:05:27.052
AND WE HAD A POLICE CHIEF.

02:05:27.119 --> 02:05:27.620
AND THAT HEARING THAT.

02:05:27.686 --> 02:05:28.220
AFTERNOON [inaudible]

02:05:28.287 --> 02:05:30.089
AND WE WERE ASKING ABOUT SOME OF

02:05:30.155 --> 02:05:32.591
THE CHALLENGES OF DEALING WITH.

02:05:32.658 --> 02:05:34.927
YOUNG BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR.

02:05:34.994 --> 02:05:37.029
AND HE STOPPED FOR A MOMENT ANY

02:05:37.096 --> 02:05:39.131
SAYS THE HARDEST DAY OF MY LIFE

02:05:39.198 --> 02:05:41.400
WAS WHEN MY SIXTEEN YEAR OLD SON

02:05:41.467 --> 02:05:42.902
GOT HIS DRIVER'S LICENSE.

02:05:42.968 --> 02:05:44.403
AND I HAD TO SIT HIM DOWN AND

02:05:44.470 --> 02:05:47.506
EXPLAIN WHAT HE SHOULD DO NOT IF

02:05:47.573 --> 02:05:49.842
HE STOPPED BY THE POLICE BUT

02:05:49.909 --> 02:05:50.876
WHEN HE STOPPED BY THE POLICE.

02:05:50.943 --> 02:05:52.511
THIS INDIVIDUAL WAS A BLACK

02:05:52.578 --> 02:05:54.980
POLICE CHIEF ANY SAYS MY WHITE

02:05:55.047 --> 02:05:56.815
COUNTERPARTS DON'T HAVE TO HAVE

02:05:56.882 --> 02:05:57.917
THIS DISCUSSION WITH THEIR KIDS.

02:05:57.983 --> 02:05:59.952
SO WE NEED TO TELL THE TRUTH

02:06:00.019 --> 02:06:02.254
HERE TODAY AND UNDERSTAND THAT

02:06:02.321 --> 02:06:03.489
THE CORE.

02:06:03.555 --> 02:06:05.491
TRAINING WILL NOT CHANGE

02:06:05.557 --> 02:06:08.527
PEOPLE'S HEART WE HAVE TO CHANGE

02:06:08.594 --> 02:06:10.462
OUR VIEW AS IT RELATES TO RACE

02:06:10.529 --> 02:06:12.498
IN THIS COUNTRY AND UNDERSTAND

02:06:12.564 --> 02:06:13.966
IT'S AT THE CORE OF EVERYTHING

02:06:14.033 --> 02:06:14.967
THAT'S BAD HERE.

02:06:15.034 --> 02:06:17.903
WE WERE FOUNDED ON RACISM AND

02:06:17.970 --> 02:06:20.506
WE'VE IN SLAVE THE BLACK PERSON

02:06:20.572 --> 02:06:22.708
WE EXPLOIT IT THE BROWN AND

02:06:22.775 --> 02:06:23.542
YELLOW PEOPLE.

02:06:23.609 --> 02:06:25.844
AND WE HAD TRIED TO ANNIHILATE

02:06:25.911 --> 02:06:30.115
TO READ MAN AND WE HAVE TO

02:06:30.182 --> 02:06:31.417
ACCEPT IT FOR WHAT IT IS SO.

02:06:31.483 --> 02:06:33.585
UNTIL WE CAN CHANGE.

02:06:33.652 --> 02:06:35.220
THE HEART OF PEOPLE THEY OFTEN

02:06:35.287 --> 02:06:36.322
SAY WHY DO BLACK AND BROWN

02:06:36.388 --> 02:06:40.259
PEOPLE RUN FROM FROM THE POLICE.

02:06:40.326 --> 02:06:41.794
THEY FEAR THE POLICE.

02:06:41.860 --> 02:06:45.331
AND YOU CAN NEVER RESPECT AND

02:06:45.397 --> 02:06:47.399
TRUST ANYTHING OR ANYONE THAT

02:06:47.466 --> 02:06:48.600
YOU FEAR.

02:06:48.667 --> 02:06:50.569
SO UNTIL WE CAN REMOVE THAT FEAR

02:06:50.636 --> 02:06:52.504
FACTOR WE'RE GOING TO STILL HAVE

02:06:52.571 --> 02:06:53.906
THESE CHALLENGES.

02:06:53.973 --> 02:06:56.909
AND YOU CAN'T PROTECT.

02:06:56.976 --> 02:07:00.879
AND SERVE AND TO YOU RESPECT AND

02:07:00.946 --> 02:07:06.318
PRESERVE LIFE.

02:07:06.385 --> 02:07:08.420
SENATOR JACKSON IS THANK YOU AND

02:07:08.487 --> 02:07:11.290
I APPRECIATE APPRECIATE THOSE

02:07:11.357 --> 02:07:13.392
ELOQUENT IN AND ACCURATE SADLY

02:07:13.459 --> 02:07:15.928
ACCURATE REMARKSABOUT OUR

02:07:15.995 --> 02:07:18.497
NATION WHICH TODAY IS BECOMING

02:07:18.564 --> 02:07:20.566
EVEN MORE.

02:07:20.632 --> 02:07:24.203
DIVIDED -- YOU MENTIONED RACE

02:07:24.269 --> 02:07:26.972
AND ETHNICITY AND AND RELIGION

02:07:27.039 --> 02:07:28.540
IT'S IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT

02:07:28.607 --> 02:07:30.442
SITUATION THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT

02:07:30.509 --> 02:07:31.944
IT AND WE HAVE TO DO MUCH BETTER.

02:07:32.011 --> 02:07:33.078
BUT I THINK ONE OF THE

02:07:33.145 --> 02:07:35.114
ADDITIONAL ASPETS THAT I JUST

02:07:35.180 --> 02:07:35.614
WANTED.

02:07:35.681 --> 02:07:37.950
TO BRING. TO THE FORE IS THE

02:07:38.017 --> 02:07:40.386
SORT OF THE PARAMILITARY NATURE.

02:07:40.452 --> 02:07:42.488
OF HOW LAW ENFORCEMENT NOW VIEWS

02:07:42.554 --> 02:07:45.924
ITSELF REALLY RATHER THAN AS

02:07:45.991 --> 02:07:47.860
COMMUNITY INTERVENE ORDERS -- AS

02:07:47.926 --> 02:07:49.962
AS A PARALEGAL MILITARY

02:07:50.029 --> 02:07:50.996
OPERATION.

02:07:51.063 --> 02:07:53.599
AND I THINK OF IN MY HOPE IS

02:07:53.665 --> 02:07:56.568
THAT WITH THIS TRAINING.

02:07:56.635 --> 02:07:57.870
WE WILL GO BACK OR OR CANYON

02:07:57.936 --> 02:07:58.971
SINGLE BACK THAT WE WILL

02:07:59.038 --> 02:08:03.275
EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT --

02:08:03.342 --> 02:08:06.812
TRUST IN PROTECT ASPECT OF WHAT

02:08:06.879 --> 02:08:08.914
POLICING IS AT LEAST

02:08:08.981 --> 02:08:10.682
THEORETICALLY SUPPOSED TO BE.

02:08:10.749 --> 02:08:14.053
A PROTECTING THE PUBLIC -- BUT I

02:08:14.119 --> 02:08:16.655
THINK IN TODAY'S WORLD WE LACK

02:08:16.722 --> 02:08:19.825
THAT ELEMENT OF COMPASSION.

02:08:19.892 --> 02:08:22.261
WE LACKED THAT ELEMENT OF TRYING

02:08:22.327 --> 02:08:25.364
TO INTERVENE EFFECTIVELY.

02:08:25.431 --> 02:08:27.433
AND RATHER THAN JUST ASSUME THAT

02:08:27.499 --> 02:08:29.301
THE ONLY WAY TO RESOLVE THE

02:08:29.368 --> 02:08:30.702
PROBLEM IS WITH A GUN.

02:08:30.769 --> 02:08:33.238
WE HAVE TO REALIZE THAT THERE

02:08:33.305 --> 02:08:35.541
ARE OTHER IN MUCH BETTER WAYS TO

02:08:35.607 --> 02:08:37.476
DO THIS.

02:08:37.543 --> 02:08:39.144
AS WE'VE LEARNED -- ABOUT THE

02:08:39.211 --> 02:08:43.549
BRAIN AS WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT

02:08:43.615 --> 02:08:44.583
MENTAL ILLNESS.

02:08:44.650 --> 02:08:45.150
HOPEFULLY WE WILL APPLY THE

02:08:45.217 --> 02:08:45.851
TECHNIQUES THAT HAVE BEEN

02:08:45.918 --> 02:08:47.352
DEVELOPED TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE

02:08:47.419 --> 02:08:49.021
MANY OF WHOM AND AS LISTENING TO

02:08:49.088 --> 02:08:51.056
THE THE HEARTFELT AND AND GUT

02:08:51.123 --> 02:08:53.258
WRENCHING STORIES OF PEOPLE WHO

02:08:53.325 --> 02:08:54.226
LOST LOVED ONES.

02:08:54.293 --> 02:08:55.961
MANY OF THEIR LOVED ONES HAVE

02:08:56.028 --> 02:08:57.529
BEEN IN CRISIS WHETHER IT'S

02:08:57.596 --> 02:08:59.865
THROUGH PTSD WHETHER IT'S JUST

02:08:59.932 --> 02:09:03.368
SIMPLE FEAR -- THAT MAKES PEOPLE

02:09:03.435 --> 02:09:06.004
REACT RATHER THAN BE RATIONAL.

02:09:06.071 --> 02:09:08.040
I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT UPON LAW

02:09:08.107 --> 02:09:10.342
ENFORCEMENT AND I SUSPECT THAT'S

02:09:10.409 --> 02:09:11.076
PART OF WHAT.

02:09:11.143 --> 02:09:13.712
ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBBER'S EFFORT

02:09:13.779 --> 02:09:15.514
IS HERE IS TO GET US TO USE THE

02:09:15.581 --> 02:09:18.050
BUILT ALL THE TOOLS THAT WE HAVE

02:09:18.117 --> 02:09:19.418
TO TRY TO DE ESCALATE THESE

02:09:19.485 --> 02:09:24.923
PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THEY BECOME --

02:09:24.990 --> 02:09:27.025
OF VIOLENCE AND BEFORE -- THEY'D

02:09:27.092 --> 02:09:29.628
THE RESULT IN THE DEATHS IN THE

02:09:29.695 --> 02:09:30.929
SERIOUS INJURY TO PEOPLE THAT

02:09:30.996 --> 02:09:31.997
ARE PROBABLY OTHERWISE

02:09:32.064 --> 02:09:33.832
AFFORDABLE SO I TO WANT TO THANK

02:09:33.899 --> 02:09:36.101
YOU FOR THE WORK THAT -- THAT

02:09:36.168 --> 02:09:39.538
YOU'VE DONE A DOCTOR WEBER THIS

02:09:39.605 --> 02:09:41.373
STRUCTURE IS NOT BEEN EASY.

02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:43.642
I AM SO PLEASED THAT THERE WAS

02:09:43.709 --> 02:09:44.743
NO OPPOSITION HERE TODAY IT

02:09:44.810 --> 02:09:46.311
SOUNDS LIKE WE'VE MADE PROGRESS

02:09:46.378 --> 02:09:47.212
IT'S NOT PERFECT.

02:09:47.279 --> 02:09:48.914
BUT I THINK IF WE START FOCUSING

02:09:48.981 --> 02:09:59.291
ON INTERVENTIONS -- RATHER THAN.

02:09:59.358 --> 02:10:00.826
THE DEADLY FORCE I THINK WE'RE

02:10:00.893 --> 02:10:03.028
GOING TO REALLY CHANGE.

02:10:03.095 --> 02:10:04.363
OUR COMMUNITIES AND DO SO FOR

02:10:04.429 --> 02:10:05.864

AND CONTINUE THIS SUCH IMPORTANT.

ENFORCEMENT WHICH WE WOULD

02:10:53.512 --> 02:10:54.947
LOOKED LIKE WE WERE MAYBE AT A

02:10:55.013 --> 02:10:56.281
SITUATION.

02:10:56.348 --> 02:10:59.117
WHERE -- THOSE DISCUSSIONS WERE

02:10:59.184 --> 02:11:00.552
EITHER WERE NOT HAPPENING OR

02:11:00.619 --> 02:11:03.555
PERHAPS WERE PRODUCTIVE AND SO I

02:11:03.622 --> 02:11:04.189

02:25:20.545 --> 02:25:22.980
HAVE WAS OF FOUND.

02:25:23.047 --> 02:25:24.415

ON THE OFFENDERS BUT IT ALSO

02:39:01.765 --> 02:39:03.767

ENFORCEMENT TO MAINTAIN THIS

02:39:08.038 --> 02:39:09.239

02:39:09.306 --> 02:39:10.574
IT DOESN'T PROVIDE ANYBODY WITH
