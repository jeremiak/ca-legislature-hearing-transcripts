GOT UP AND TALKED ABOUT HOW

01:29:22.290 --> 01:29:24.592
IMPORTANT THIS INFORMATION WAS

01:29:24.659 --> 01:29:26.461
IN MOTIVATING THEM TO STAY IN

01:29:28.196 --> 01:29:29.497
TO BECOME THE PROFESSIONALS THEY

HOW HAVING THAT INFORMATION WAS

01:29:43.211 --> 01:29:44.479
SO IMPORTANT IN SHAPING WHO THEY

01:29:44.545 --> 01:29:45.580

CLASSIFICATION FOR MANY YEARS.

01:41:54.374 --> 01:41:56.410
THIS IN EQUITY HAS CREATED A

01:41:56.477 --> 01:41:57.277
NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN

01:41:57.344 --> 01:42:01.014

TALKING ABOUT.

01:42:36.183 --> 01:42:37.885
AND THAT BECOMES IMPORTANT.

01:42:37.951 --> 01:42:39.186
THE CURRENT STRUCTURE DOES NOT

01:42:39.253 --> 01:42:41.188

HANDLED WITH MY STAFF.

01:42:46.393 --> 01:42:47.661
THIS WAS A PROBABLY THE MOST

01:42:47.728 --> 01:42:49.997
DIFFICULT THING TO HAVE YEAR

01:42:50.063 --> 01:42:51.665

TO INTERVENE.

02:04:42.708 --> 02:04:45.411

HAVE ARGUED AGAINST COMMON SENSE

02:08:55.694 --> 02:08:57.596
REFORMS SUCH AS THIS HAVE SAID

02:08:57.663 --> 02:08:59.098
THAT PEOPLE NEED ACCESS TO A

THE RISK SO OF SUBPRIME LENDING

RISK BASED PRICING IS SIMPLY NOT

02:09:11.877 --> 02:09:12.678
HAPPENING.

02:09:12.744 --> 02:09:14.146
IF LENDERS WERE IN FACT WRITING

02:09:43.342 --> 02:09:44.676
HIGH COST LENDERS ARE

02:09:44.743 --> 02:09:46.578

UNIONS AND SO I UNDERSTAND ANNE

02:13:44.483 --> 02:13:46.318
ACTUALLY BELIEVED THAT THEY WERE

02:13:46.385 --> 02:13:49.821
NECESSARY FOR SOME FOLKS WHO

02:13:49.888 --> 02:13:50.722

IF I HADN'T KNOWN BETTER THAT I

02:14:22.020 --> 02:14:23.855
DIDN'T NEED THAT TYPE OF LOAN.

02:14:23.922 --> 02:14:24.990
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT

02:14:25.056 --> 02:14:26.792
HAPPENS IN A COMMUNITY LIKE MINE

02:14:26.858 --> 02:14:28.093

SOME OF THEM HAVE NO CREDIT

02:14:32.464 --> 02:14:33.565
BECAUSE THEY BUT NOT BANKS AND

IT'S POSSIBLE IT'S DOABLE.

02:14:43.074 --> 02:14:44.943
THE STORES UNFORTUNATELY ARE

02:14:45.010 --> 02:14:47.145
PREYING ON COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE

02:14:47.212 --> 02:14:48.480

02:14:48.547 --> 02:14:50.081
OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE AND WE DO

02:14:50.148 --> 02:14:52.851

DO MORE TO BRING PEOPLE INTO OUR

02:14:55.554 --> 02:14:57.289
COMMUNITIES WE HAVE TO FIGURE

02:14:57.355 --> 02:14:58.824
OUT HOW TO INCENTIVIZE LENDING

02:14:58.890 --> 02:15:00.425

NOTION OF TRYING TO BRING.

04:47:57.693 --> 04:48:00.329
PEOPLE INTO HOUSING EARLIER THAN

THEY WOULD OTHERWISE.

04:48:01.897 --> 04:48:04.000
BUT BECAUSE USING CALLIN VIRUS

04:48:04.066 --> 04:48:06.302
GREEN AS A TOOL PRESENTS A BIT

04:48:06.369 --> 04:48:07.336
OF A CHALLENGE TO ME.

04:48:07.403 --> 04:48:09.572
THIS WOULD BE REQUIRING THAT THE

04:48:09.639 --> 04:48:12.274
HOME BE PURCHASED IN A CALAVERAS

04:48:12.341 --> 04:48:14.143
SCREEN AREA WHICH IS AN AREA

04:48:14.210 --> 04:48:15.745
CALAVERAS KING WAS PUT IN PLACE.

04:48:15.811 --> 04:48:18.581

BAD AIR QUALITY.

04:48:21.617 --> 04:48:23.319

PURCHASE OF HOMES IN AREAS

04:48:25.321 --> 04:48:26.756
IDENTIFIED WITH BETTER QUALITY.

04:48:26.822 --> 04:48:28.324
THE REVERSE WOULD BE PROBABLY

04:48:28.391 --> 04:48:29.859
MUCH MUCH BETTER THAT IF WE GAVE

04:48:29.925 --> 04:48:32.461
THEM THIS CREDIT FOR MOVING OUT

04:48:32.528 --> 04:48:33.796
OF THE CALAVERAS SCREEN AREA

04:48:33.863 --> 04:48:35.164
THAT'S THE KIND OF A PROGRAM

04:48:35.231 --> 04:48:36.232
THAT I THINK WE SHOULD BE.

04:48:36.298 --> 04:48:38.734
PROVIDING AN INCENTIVE.

04:48:38.801 --> 04:48:39.602

04:48:39.669 --> 04:48:41.470
NOT REALLY DESIGNED FOR A

04:48:41.537 --> 04:48:44.273
PROGRAM LIKE THIS AND BECAUSE OF

04:48:44.340 --> 04:48:45.541
THAT BECAUSE IT'S A THOSE ARE

04:48:45.608 --> 04:48:46.976
IDENTIFIED AREAS WITH POOR AIR

04:48:47.043 --> 04:48:49.311
QUALITY.

04:48:49.378 --> 04:48:50.312

CONCENTRATE THEM IN AREAS WITH

WE TALK ALL THE TIME ABOUT

05:22:25.693 --> 05:22:27.628
INCREASING SUPPLY BUT WE SPEND

05:22:54.421 --> 05:22:55.556
OUR CITIES TO HAVE SHORT TERM

05:22:55.622 --> 05:22:57.157

06:26:57.427 --> 06:26:59.429
NOW IS CLEARLY NOT WORKING AND

06:26:59.496 --> 06:27:00.964
DEFENDING THE STATUS QUO.

06:27:01.031 --> 06:27:02.232
AND DOING NEXT TO NOTHING WHEN

06:27:02.299 --> 06:27:03.333
WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE OTHER

06:27:03.400 --> 06:27:05.035
SOLUTIONS OUT THERE THAT CITIES

06:27:05.101 --> 06:27:06.136
ARE WILLING TO TRY.

06:27:06.202 --> 06:27:08.305
IS SIMPLY NOT ACCEPTABLE IN THE

06:27:08.371 --> 06:27:10.040
FACE OF THE DRUG EPIDEMIC.

06:27:10.106 --> 06:27:11.341
AND IN CASE ANYBODY THINGS THAT

06:27:11.408 --> 06:27:13.243
THIS IS SOME KIND OF CRAZY SHOT

06:27:13.310 --> 06:27:14.644
IN THE DARK OF A SOLUTION.

06:27:14.711 --> 06:27:16.479
LET ME REMIND EVERYBODY THAT

06:27:16.546 --> 06:27:17.847
CANADA HAS EMPLOYED THIS VERY

06:27:17.914 --> 06:27:21.117
SAME SOLUTION FOR YEARS AND IS

06:27:21.184 --> 06:27:22.886
SEEN IN THE AREAS AROUND.

06:27:22.953 --> 06:27:25.422
THE SAFE INJECTION SITES A DROP

06:27:25.488 --> 06:27:26.456
IN CRIME.

06:27:26.523 --> 06:27:29.125
A DROP IN DEATHS.

06:27:29.192 --> 06:27:31.061
A DROP IN DISEASE.

06:27:31.127 --> 06:27:33.930
AND MANY OTHER POSITIVE RESULTS.

06:27:33.997 --> 06:27:35.465
NOW IN LOS ANGELES AND IN MANY

06:27:35.532 --> 06:27:36.600
OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE

06:27:36.666 --> 06:27:40.236
WE HAVE -- DRUGS WE'VE ALSO SEEN

06:27:40.303 --> 06:27:42.472
OUTBREAKS OF HEPATITIS AND OTHER

06:27:42.539 --> 06:27:43.840
COMMUNICABLE DISEASES.

06:27:43.907 --> 06:27:46.109
HAVING PEOPLE IN FACILITIES WITH

06:27:46.176 --> 06:27:48.144
TRAINED MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS

06:27:48.211 --> 06:27:48.945
WHICH IS WHAT THESE FACILITIES

06:27:49.012 --> 06:27:49.813
OFFER.

06:27:49.879 --> 06:27:52.482
IS A WAY TO RECOGNIZE AND TREAT

06:27:52.549 --> 06:27:54.317
DISEASE BEFORE THEY BECOME AN

06:27:54.384 --> 06:27:57.721
EPIDEMIC IN OUR ENTIRE COMMUNITY.

06:27:57.787 --> 06:27:59.856
SO IF NOT FOR THE ADDICTS

06:27:59.923 --> 06:28:01.091
THEMSELVES.

06:28:01.157 --> 06:28:02.325
AND IT SHOULD BE FOR THE ADDICTS

06:28:02.392 --> 06:28:03.827
THEMSELVES BUT IF THAT'S NOT IF

06:28:03.893 --> 06:28:05.595
THEY'RE LIVES DON'T MEAN ENOUGH

06:28:05.662 --> 06:28:07.764
FOR YOU. TO TAKE THIS MEASURE

06:28:07.831 --> 06:28:09.366
THEN THINK ABOUT THE REST OF THE

06:28:09.432 --> 06:28:10.166
COMMUNITY AND WHAT THEY'RE

06:28:10.233 --> 06:28:11.835
BEARING WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE

06:28:11.901 --> 06:28:13.136
LIVING ON THE STREETS AND

06:28:13.203 --> 06:28:14.804
WITHOUT MEDICAL CARE THIS IS A

06:28:14.871 --> 06:28:17.140
WAY TO GET PEOPLE INTO MEDICAL

06:28:17.207 --> 06:28:18.441
TREATMENT THAT'S PROVEN AND THAT

06:28:18.508 --> 06:28:18.675
WORKS.

06:28:18.742 --> 06:28:20.343
AND WITH THAT I WOULD WOULD ASK

06:28:20.410 --> 06:28:22.345
YOU TO LOOK DEEP INTO YOUR HEART

06:28:22.412 --> 06:28:24.247
AND VOTE I ON THIS MEASURE TODAY

06:28:24.314 --> 06:28:26.883

06:28:28.752 --> 06:28:29.552
THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER

06:28:29.619 --> 06:28:30.620
COLLEAGUES APPRECIATE YOUR

06:28:30.687 --> 06:28:33.223
CONSIDERATION OF A PILOT OF THE

06:28:33.289 --> 06:28:34.724
OVERDOSE PREVENTION PROGRAM.

06:28:34.791 --> 06:28:36.660
AND LET ME THANK OUR COLLEAGUE

06:28:36.726 --> 06:28:38.795
FROM STOCKTON FOR HER.

06:28:38.862 --> 06:28:40.397
LONG ADVOCACY ON THIS ISSUE --

06:28:40.463 --> 06:28:42.465
AND AS WE JUST HEARD FROM ONE OF

06:28:42.532 --> 06:28:43.867
OUR COLLEAGUES -- UNFORTUNATELY

06:28:43.933 --> 06:28:44.868
AT THIS TIME THROUGH THE

06:28:44.934 --> 06:28:47.303
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS -- WE HAVE

06:28:47.370 --> 06:28:49.572
DECIDED TO JUST NARAL THIS TO

06:28:49.639 --> 06:28:50.974
OUR CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO AND

06:28:51.041 --> 06:28:52.676
I'M VERY APPRECIATIVE AS A

06:28:52.742 --> 06:28:54.077
REPRESENTATIVE OF SAN FRANCISCO.

06:28:54.144 --> 06:28:55.979
OUGHT TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

06:28:56.046 --> 06:28:56.880
FOR THIS DIALOGUE.

06:28:56.946 --> 06:28:58.682
BUT I DO HOPE THAT WE ARE ABLE

06:28:58.748 --> 06:29:00.450
TO TEST IF IT WORKS AND IT IS

06:29:00.517 --> 06:29:02.819
THAT NARROW -- THIS IS AN IDEA

06:29:02.886 --> 06:29:04.354
THAT I THINK MANY OF US WHEN WE

06:29:04.421 --> 06:29:06.156
FIRST HEAR ABOUT IT IT TAKES A

06:29:06.222 --> 06:29:08.124
LITTLE TIME. TO UNDERSTAND IT

06:29:08.191 --> 06:29:09.526
AND TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE DATA

06:29:09.592 --> 06:29:11.027
IS BUT IF YOU LOOK AROUND THE

06:29:11.094 --> 06:29:12.095
WORLD THAT STUDIES.

06:29:12.162 --> 06:29:14.130
ARE AROUND THE GLOBE WE HAVE

06:29:14.197 --> 06:29:16.099
SEEN THIS WORK AND THIS IS WHY

06:29:16.166 --> 06:29:17.033
PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS

06:29:17.100 --> 06:29:18.368
SUPPORTED IF YOU LOOK AT IT FROM

06:29:18.435 --> 06:29:19.836
A FISCAL STANDPOINT THIS IS

06:29:19.903 --> 06:29:20.970
SOMETHING THAT COULD SAVE

06:29:21.037 --> 06:29:22.238
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

06:29:22.305 --> 06:29:23.973
BECAUSE IT ALREADY HAS IN OTHER

06:29:24.040 --> 06:29:25.675
JURISDICTIONS IF YOU LOOK AT IT

06:29:25.742 --> 06:29:27.210
FROM A PUBLIC SAFETY STANDPOINT

06:29:27.277 --> 06:29:28.645
THE REASON LAW ENFORCEMENT

06:29:28.712 --> 06:29:30.980
SUPPORTS THIS IS A NOTE THIS IS

06:29:31.047 --> 06:29:32.115
A DIFFERENT SOLUTION.

06:29:32.182 --> 06:29:34.350
THAT ACTUALLY WORKS BUT IN SHORT

06:29:34.417 --> 06:29:36.419
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

06:29:36.486 --> 06:29:38.188
WHO ARE DYING ON THE STREETS.

06:29:38.254 --> 06:29:39.789
IN OUR COMMUNITIES UP AND DOWN

06:29:39.856 --> 06:29:41.024
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHAT

06:29:41.091 --> 06:29:43.093
WE'RE ASKING FOR THIS BILL IS TO

06:29:43.159 --> 06:29:44.461
ALLOW FOR ONE PILOT.

06:29:44.527 --> 06:29:46.029
IN A CITY THAT IS SEVEN BY SEVEN

06:29:46.096 --> 06:29:48.998
SQUARE MILES TO SEE IF THIS WILL

06:29:49.065 --> 06:29:50.233
WORK AND IF IT DOES WE CAN HAVE

06:29:50.300 --> 06:29:51.901
A CONVERSATION ABOUT EXPANDING

06:29:51.968 --> 06:29:53.036
IT AROUND THE STATE.

06:29:53.103 --> 06:29:54.771
AT THE END OF THE DAY WE HAVE A

06:29:54.838 --> 06:29:56.306
DUTY TO MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING

06:29:56.372 --> 06:29:57.774
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO SAVE THE

06:29:57.841 --> 06:30:01.244
LIVES OF OUR CONSTITUENTS I

06:30:01.311 --> 06:30:01.778

HEALTH COMMITTEE AND I FIRST SAW

06:30:09.953 --> 06:30:11.421
THAT MY FIRST GUT INSTINCT WAS

06:30:11.488 --> 06:30:12.155

CAN'T SUPPORT THIS.

06:30:18.361 --> 06:30:20.964
GIVE ME POLITICALLY DIFFICULT

06:30:21.030 --> 06:30:21.865
FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO DO SO.

06:30:21.931 --> 06:30:24.000
BUT WE KNOW THAT DRUG ADDICTION

06:30:24.067 --> 06:30:26.302
