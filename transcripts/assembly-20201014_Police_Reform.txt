AB MR LACKEY AND I SAT IN THIS ROOM A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO AND HEARD AB THREE NINETY TWO STARTED EIGHT IN THE MORNING AND WE SAT HERE FOR HOURS UPON HOURS AS WE LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA COME INTO THIS ROOM GROUP BY GROUP AND TESTIFY. THE ABUSE OF FORCE THAT THEY HAD EXPERIENCED AT THE HANDS OF OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND I KNOW FOR ME IT WAS. A MOMENT I WILL NEVER FORGET IN A MOMENT TO CHECK ME AND THAT WAS AND WE WENT ON TO PASS AB THREE NINETY TWO DOCTOR MEMBERS INCREDIBLE BILL THE STRONG AS USE OF FORCE ON THE NATION HERE IN CALIFORNIA BEFORE THIS SPRING WHEN THE CONVERSATIONS REALLY STARTED TO RISE TO A NEW LEVEL AROUND WHAT IS RIGHT IN THIS SPACE AND I AM GLAD THIS CONVERSATION CONTINUES BECAUSE THE WORK MUST CONTINUE. AND WE HAD WE DID SOME INCREDIBLE WORK AT THE END OF SESSION AND SPEEDY TIME INCLUDING YOUR BILL MISTER GIBSON WHICH BANS THE CROWDED HOLD BUT THERE IS SO MUCH MORE TO DO AND SO I'M GLAD WE'RE HERE TOGETHER IN A BIPARTISAN WAY SO WE CAN CONTINUE THIS WORK AND DO WHAT IS RIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND IN THE FUTURE LEGISLATURES WILL NOT HAVE TO SIT. AND LISTEN TO PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA TESTIFIED TO THE ABUSE OF FORCE AS THEY DID BEFORE US. GONZALEZ AND THANK YOU GERMAN GIPSON AND I WOULD I THINK SPEAKER PLAYING ME TO THE SOME SELECT COMMITTEE I YOU KNOW IT'S OF INTEREST TO ME THAT WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT THE HISTORY OF POLICE REFORM. IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE ARGUABLY THERE ISN'T MUCH OF A HISTORY OF POLICE REFORM IN FAVOR OF THE COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA IN IN REALITY THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE- THAT'S WHY WE DEALT IN THE LAST FEW YEARS WITH SOME REALLY TOUGH ISSUES INCLUDING. DOCTOR WEBER JEEZ FORCE BILL INCLUDING- MISTER TEAMS ODY BILL MEAN WE'VE WE'VE BEEN SO. AB MISC. AT KNOW. TRANSPARENCY BILL WE'VE BEEN STARTING TO AT LEAST LOOK AT THESE ISSUES. BUT IT DOESN'T COME QUICK ENOUGH FOR COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE. AND SO THE URGENCY OF THIS MATTER IS ESSENTIAL AND I'M GLAD WE'RE HERE AND IT IS IMPORTANT TO BRING EVERYBODY TOGETHER. AND I WAS DISAPPOINTED LAST YEAR. AT WHAT I SAW ON JUDICIARY A BILL ON ON PLEASE DECERTIFICATION BUT I THINK WE CRITICALLY NEED WE CRITICALLY HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE FACT. THAT THERE HAS TO BE A WAY TO DECERTIFY BAD COPS AND CLAPS THOUGHT SO TOO THE UNIONS SAID THEY AGREED. AND YET- WE COULDN'T GET TO A PLACE ON THAT BILL. WHERE SOME QUESTIONS WERE ANSWERED AND SOME HOLES WERE WERE FILLED- I HOPE FOR ABLE TO DO THAT BECAUSE I THINK WE WILL HAVE FAILED OUR RESPONSIBILITY IF WE DON'T AT LEAST GET TO THAT CRITICAL PIECE AND A CRITICAL JUNCTURE OUT OF THIS- I LOOK FORWARD TO TELL WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND I LOOK FOR TO SUBMERGENCE THE FOR MY COMMUNITIES AND OTHERS LIKE THAT BUT HAVE BEEN. UNFORTUNATELY WAITING FOR POLICE REFORM I'M FOR VERY LONG TIME AND IN NO WAY IS THAT. TO JET TO SUGGEST I MEAN I CAME OUT ORGANIZED LABOR OF COURSE I I'VE WORKED WITH POLICE UNIONS FOR VERY LONG TIME AND- I UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITY OF POPE ARE AND WHAT YOU KNOW. THE RIGHTS OF WORKERS AS WELL BUT THIS IS THE TIME TO STAND UP FOR COMMUNITIES AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE. ACTUALLY GET SOME THINGS DONE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY- OKAY. YEAH YOU THANK YOU TERM GIPSON FOR US AND ALSO TO THANK OUR SPEAKER ANTHONY RENDON FOR POINTING ME TO THIS THIS IMPORTANT TIME WE SELECT COMMITTEE- YOU KNOW I WILL ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS OF A LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES AND CERTAINLY OUR DEBATE ON THE FLOOR LAST YEAR ON. ON AB THREE NINETY- AND LISTENING TO OTHER SUPPORT PERSPECTIVES IN TESTIMONY OF OUR COLLEAGUES INCLUDING MR LACKEY AND ALSO- COLLEAGUES OF OURS WHO- COME FROM COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WHO HAD VERY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT- WAS ONE OF THE MOST PROFOUND AND MOVING. MOMENTS THAT I'VE HAD IN MY SHORT TIME IN THE LEGISLATURE- I FOUND THAT TO BE A VERY VERY MOVING DAY IN AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION AND THEN CERTAINLY HAVE THAT FOLLOWED UP BY THE EVENTS THAT WE WITNESSED- OVER THE SUMMER WITH THAT WITH THE BRUTAL KILLING OF GEORGE FLOYD AND THIS PROFOUND NATIONAL MOMENT THAT WE'VE HAD. ON OWN RECKONING OF ISSUES AND RACE AND JUSTICE THE CONCLUSION THAT I REALLY CAME TO AND I THINK A LOT OF FOLKS IN MY COMMUNITY CAME TO IS THAT THERE'S SYSTEM SYSTEMIC CHANGES NEEDED IN THIS COUNTRY ON ISSUES OF RACE AND JUSTICE-AND NOT CERTAINLY GOES ACROSS THE HALL IS- A RANGE OF ISSUES FROM FROM EDUCATION TO HEALTH CARE TO OPPORTUNITIES TO ALL OF THESE. DIFFERENT ISSUE THAT WE EXAMINE THE LEGISLATURE BUT POLICING IS CERTAINLY A CRITICAL PART OF THAT CONVERSATION AND I THINK THAT THERE REALLY IS A DEMAND. FOR CHANGING FOR CONVERSATION AROUND THIS AND SO I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS SELECT COMMITTEE VERY MUCH I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE AN IMPORTANT ONE I'M LOOKING FOR TO LISTENING AND LEARNING- HEARING FOR THE PERSPECTIVES OF THESE PERCENT PRESENTERS AND THEN HOPEFULLY MOVING FORWARD AS AS OUR OUR COLLEAGUE SAID WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY AND I THINK THAT THIS IS WORK THAT THE PEOPLE DEMAND. THAT THE PEOPLE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO MAN AND I THINK THAT THERE ARE WAYS THAT WE CAN APPROACH THIS WITH NUANCE WITH- WITH CLARITY AND UNDERSTANDING THE VARIOUS ISSUES APPLY- AND HOPEFULLY MOVE FORWARD IN A WAY WE CAN GET IT RIGHT BECAUSE WE HAVE TO GET IT RIGHT I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA ARE DEMANDING OF US AND SO- THE CERTAINLY A LOT OF WORK TO DO. IN THE COMING IN THE COMING SESSION BUT I'M VERY CONFIDENT- IN THE GROUP OF COLLEAGUES THAT THAT. YOU ON THE SPEAKER HAVE ASSEMBLED HERE MISTER CHAIRMAN AND REALLY LOOKING FOR TO IT TO BE PART OF THIS COME. SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR TO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR CONVENING. THIS SUCH AN IMPORTANT- SELECT COMMITTEE AND I THANK ALSO THE SPEAKER FOR RECOGNIZING THE URGENCY OF HAVING. SUCH A COMMITTEE FORMED TO DISCUSS THIS EVEN BEFORE WE START SESSION IT'S ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THE HISTORY AND- WE'VE GOT A LONG WAY TO GO BUT WE'VE DONE SOME THINGS WE REALLY HAVE. AND WE HAVE MEMBERS OF OUR OUR OUR BODY WHO HAVE. RESENTED THESE THE URGENCY OF THE CHANGES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN NEEDED. OF THE BEST EXAMPLE THAT WE'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT IS- DR WEBER'S AB THREE THREE NINETY TWO- BUT WE ALSO. YOUR YOUR BILL ON CHOKEHOLDS MISTER GIBSON. AND ALSO THE AG'S INVESTIGATION OF POLICE INVOLVED SHOOTINGS- IN THE WATCHDOG PANELS THE USE OF ALL BEEN DISCUSSED AND I THINK THESE ARE ALL. GOOD BEGINNING POINTS. WE HAVE DONE A LOT BUT THERE IS SO MUCH LEFT TO DO- I KNOW THAT WE'RE NOT ALL GOING TO AGREE ON THE SOLUTIONS. BUT BEFORE WE HAVE A PER PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION WE HAVE TO AGREE THAT THE PROBLEM EXISTS. TO THOSE WHO WANT TO SEE REFORM OF POLICING THE STATE AND NATION I HEAR YOU WE HEAR YOU. TO THOSE. FAMILIES WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THE PAIN OF THE LOSS FROM THE INTERACTIONS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT WE HEAR YOU ALSO. WE WILL HEAR YOU WITH KNOWLEDGE THE PAIN THAT YOU BOOK THAT YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED. TO LAW ENFORCEMENT YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT RESOURCES AND TRAINING NEEDED TO DO YOUR JOB AND TO PROTECT AND SERVE THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE. THERE ALSO ARE CONCERNS AND WE HEAR YOU. IN ADDITION TO THE POTENTIAL REFORMS. RELATED TO THE PROCESS OF POLICING I HOPE THAT THROUGH THE SERIES OF HEARINGS THAT WILL OCCUR THAT WE WILL LOOK AT WAYS THAT WE CAN INVEST IN EARLIER SYSTEMS INVEST IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR YOUTH SO THAT WE CAN TURN THIS TIDE AROUND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISERY AS- MISTER CUNNINGHAM YOU'RE UP TO BAT FOR COMMENTS IN YOUR INTRODUCTION THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. THANK YOU CHAIR FOR HOSTING US TODAY. SO IMPORTANT ISSUE WE GOT A LOT OF DIFFICULT THINGS. FLUSH OUT I'M INTERESTED TO HEAR THE TESTIMONY. OF I THINK WE'RE ALL WORKING TOWARDS THE SAME THING. AND I'D LIKE TO HEAR IDEAS FOR HOW WE CAN EMPHASIZE- TRAINING GET MORE TRAINING. I THINK WE CAN ACKNOWLEDGE THERE BEEN SOME TREMENDOUS INJUSTICES DONE. WHICH SADDENS ME I DO BELIEVE THAT MOST OFFICERS THEY'RE SWORN A DIFFICULT JOB WITH INTEGRITY. I DO BELIEVE THAT. THEY DESERVE OUR SUPPORT AND THEY DESERVE OUR HELP IN TERMS OF TRAINING. I COULD WAXON FOR A LONG TIME BUT JUST THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN MY- DISTRICT RECENTLY. YEAH WE HAD AN ACTIVE SHOOTER MY HOMETOWN TWO MONTHS AGO. I HAVE PERSONAL FRIENDS THAT RESPONDED TO THAT ONE OF HIM TOOK A BULLET THROUGH THE LAKE. FORTUNATE THAT HE SURVIVED I JUST LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE. WORK THROUGH THESE DIFFICULT ISSUES RIGHT TRY TO CHART A PATH FORWARD THAT'S THE TITLE OF OUR HEARING A SUGGEST THAT WERE. ETHNOLOGY THAT. YOU PLEASE WORK IS DIFFICULT AND WE EXPECT A LOT OF THEM WITH IT'S FIRST TO ILL PERSON WHETHER RESPONDING TO SOMEBODY THAT'S VIOLENT OR DANGEROUS. AND THEY THEY DESERVE OUR SUPPORT IN THAT EFFORT.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE- AND THEN OFFER HIM AN OPPORTUNITY- MISTER LOWE TO GIVE SOME BRIEF COMMENTS INTO SOME SO THANKS FOR JOINING US THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR JACKO THE COMMENTS WITH RESPECT TO ENSURING THAT WE ARE NOT.

OF THIS A SELECT COMMITTEE AS WE THANK HIM FOR HIS LEADERSHIP IN THE WORK THAT HE'S- AND ALL OF US. ARE GETTING READY TO EMBARK UPON WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID WE WANT TO GIVE. KUDOS TO OURS OUR SPEAKER ANTHONY RENDON. FOUR ONE- EXERCISING WISDOM EXPEDITIOUSLY- EVEN THOUGH WE ARE RECESSED- HE WANTS TO MAKE SURE THE CONVERSATIONS- IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS TAKES PLACE IN THE SPACE AROUND. POLICE OFFICER REFORM AND I THINK THAT HE HAS ASSEMBLED- VERY- DIVERSE ARRAY OF INDIVIDUALS AND CAN COLLEAGUES FROM THE STATE ASSEMBLY TO HAVE. THIS IN A VERY IMPORTANT DIALOGUE.

WE CAN ALL DISAGREE WITHOUT BEING DISAGREEABLE. WE WILL HAVE- DISCUSSIONS THAT WILL BE HEATED AND- THROUGHOUT THE THIS AND THE SERIES OF MEETINGS- BUT THIS IS THE PLACE WE HAVE IT.

AT THIS POINT WE WILL TO BEFORE WE BEGIN WITH PANEL DISCUSS WE WILL HEAR TO- PRESENTATIONS ON THE HISTORY OF POLICE REFORM. EACH PRESENTER WILL HAVE UP TO TWELVE MINUTES UP TO TWELVE MINUTES UP TO TWELVE MINUTES TO SPEAK- AND PROVIDE. OF THEIR PRESENTATION IN THE ORDER ON THE AGENDA. BEFORE THEY PRESENT THEMSELVES THEY WILL ALSO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SELF INTRODUCED. SO WITH THAT BEING SAID. THE FIRST A PRESENTER IS DR PETER HART THINK IN PLEASE% FORGIVE ME IF I MISPRONOUNCE YOUR NAME WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL CERTAINLY CORRECT IN YOUR INTRODUCTION. WHO WILL BE PARTICIPATING VIRTUALLY. AND SO WE WELCOME YOU AND YOU CAN BEGIN. YOUR COMMENTS. YOUR COMMENTS. HELLO MY NAME IS PETER HANNAH I AM RESIDENT OF THE CITY OF LONG BEACH. AND A NATIVE OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY I'M A PROFESSOR OF SOCIOLOGY AND CRIMINOLOGY AT CAL POLY POMONA. I FOCUS ON POLICING- MY RESEARCH FOCUSES ON POLICE CITIZEN INTERACTIONS RACE AND POLICE USE OF FORCE. WHEN YOU LOOK BACK AT THE LAST FEW DECADES OF POLICE REFORM IN UNITED STATES IN CALIFORNIA. WE MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO CONCLUDE. BUT NOTHING WORKS. AFTER ALL EVERY SINGLE CYCLE OF POLICE REFORM SEEMS TO FOLLOW A SIMILAR PATTERN. WE GET SOME KIND OF CRISIS EVENT THAT OCCURS WITH CALLS FOR REFORM. WE GET A CALL HOME AFTER THOSE REFORMS AND THEN THERE'S ANOTHER CRISIS EVENT. AND WE FIND OURSELVES NOW IN A SIMILAR MOMENT. ARE THE VOICES WHO SAY THAT NOTHING WORKS RIGHT I DON'T THINK SO I DON'T THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE PESSIMISTIC ABOUT THAT. ARE WE DOOMED TO KEEP REPEATING THE SAME CYCLE OF CRISIS REFORM PALM NEW CRISIS. I DON'T THINK SO BUT I THINK IT IF WE'RE GOING TO GET OUT OF THIS PATTERN. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON. AND IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY. I THINK IT'S CUTE BUT WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY DOING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. RATHER THE PATTERN THAT WE SEE IS MORE LIKE THE SWINGING OF THE PENDULUM. WHERE WE MOVE FROM ONE SIDE TO ANOTHER. AND SO IF WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN THIS PATH FORWARD TOWARDS POLICE REFORM I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK BACK. AND WHEN WE LOOK BACK A TO MAKE SENSE OF THE COMPLICATED HISTORY OF POLICE REFORM I WANT TO FOCUS ON THREE AREAS. WHICH I'M GONNA CALL DISCRETION. DISTANCE AND DATA. FIRST REGARDING DISCRETION AT THE MOST BASIC LEVEL DISCRETION IN THE CONTEXT OF POLICING JUST REFERS TO THE AMOUNT OF TRUST THAT WE GIVE TO POLICE OFFICERS TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS THE TENSION THIS PENDULUM SWING THAT I DESCRIBE WITHIN DISCRETION ARE THE IMPOSITION OF STRICT RULES. VERSUS TOTAL DEFERENCE TO POLICE OFFICER JUDGMENT. AND WE SEEM TO SWING BETWEEN THESE TWO EXTREMES. BETWEEN ANY APPLICATION OF STRICT RULES WHICH GIVE ZERO DISCRETION. TWO MORE DEFERENCE WHICH GIVES MAYBE TOO MUCH DISCRETION. AND IN THIS TENSION BETWEEN THOSE ARE THE EXAMPLE I LIKE TO USE MY STUDENTS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT DISCRETION IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A FRY COOK AND A BRAIN SURGEON. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE JOB OF A FRY COOK WHAT DO THEY DO WELL IF YOU'RE WORKING AT MCDONALD'S OR BURGER KING YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO CUT THE FRIES A PARTICULAR WITH. YOU PUT IT IN THE FRYER FOR A PARTICULAR NUMBER OF SECONDS AND THEN YOU'VE GOT YOUR DONE YOU DO THREE SHAKES OF SALT AND THEN THAT'S IT. OBVIOUSLY THAT KIND OF STRICT RULE BASED PROCESS. IS INAPPROPRIATE WITHIN THE- WITHIN A CONTEXT. AS DIFFICULT AND DYNAMIC AS POLICING. FORMER LA POLICE LAPD POLICE CHIEF CHARLIE BECK WAS FOND OF SAYING IF WE WANTED TO DO TOMORROW WE COULD END A DRIVERS DISTRACTED WITH CELL PHONES IN THE CAR. THE PROBLEM IS WITH THAT'S THE ONLY THING WE WOULD BE DOING. IF WE WANTED TO EVERY SINGLE TIME A POLICE OFFICER SEES SOMEONE ON THE PHONE IN THE CAR THEY COULD PULL THEM OVER BUT THEN THEY WOULDN'T BE PULLING OVER THE DRUNK DRIVERS WOULD BE PULLING OVER THE PEOPLE SPEEDING. WOULD BE PULLING OVER THE PEOPLE WHO MAYBE WE ARE ACTUALLY MORE CONCERNED ABOUT. ULTIMATELY SO MUCH OF POLICING IS ABOUT MAKING DECISIONS WERE GIVEN A NARROW RANGE OF OPTIONS AND DISCRETION. IS HOW POLICE OFFICERS MAKE THOSE DECISIONS. AND IF WE CONSTRAIN DIRECTION TOO MUCH. THEN WE RISK A BAD OUTCOMES. AT THE SAME TIME WHEN WE SEE THESE ABUSES WHEN WE SEE THESE CASES OF CRISES OF TRUST AND LEGITIMACY. OUR NATURAL INCLINATIONS TO SWING TO THE OTHER EXTREME IN TO SAY OKAY WHAT WE NEED TO IMPOSE. BOUNDARIES ON POLICE DISCRETION BUT UNFORTUNATE THE WAY WE TEND TO DO THAT. IS WELL I'M A LAWYER AND MANY OF YOU MIGHT BE LAWYERS TO WE ACT LIKE LAWYERS. THAT WE IMPOSE REASON THE BILL OF THE TESTS. AND WE SAY WHAT WHAT A REASONABLE OFFICER TO WHAT'S A REASONABLE USE OF FOR USE OF FORCE. AND UNFORTUNATELY A AS WE ALL KNOW. SO FEW OF OUR POLICE OFFICERS ARE LAWYERS. AND IF WAY THAT WE'RE ATTEMPT. TO IMPOSE THIS. IF THE WAY THEIR ATTEMPTING TO LIMIT DISCRETION. IS TO ASK POLICE OFFICERS TO BECOME CONSTITUTIONAL LAWYERS. TO DO THE THINGS THAT THE SUPREME COURT ITSELF IS RELUCTANT TO DO WHERE ENGRAM VERSUS CONNOR IT SAYS THAT POLICE USE OF FORCE MUST BE REASONABLE. WELL WHAT'S REASONABLE MEANS. WHO IS THE REASONABLE MAN WHO IS THE POLICE OFFICER WAS A REASONABLE POLICE OFFICER THESE ARE REALLY TOUGH QUESTIONS. AND IS THAT THE WAY THAT WE IMPOSE DISCRETION. WE WILL WE SO IN THIS TENSION BETWEEN THESE TWO EXTREMES WE RISK LEARNING THE WRONG LESSON IT'S NOT THE DISCRETION IS BAD DISCRETION IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF POLICING BUT THERE HAVE TO BE LIMITS. THE NEXT AREA IS DISTANCE. SO MUCH OF THE TIME THE TENSION WHEN IT COMES TO DISTANCE IS HOW CLOSE SHOULD THE POLICE BE TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY'RE POLICING. THE LESSON THAT WE TOOK AWAY FROM THE EVENTS OF THE NINETEEN NINETIES. REMOVE THE FROM RODNEY KING AND THE EN LA NINETY TWO SO MUCH OF THAT WOULD THE TAKEAWAY WAS THAT POLICE WERE OUTSIDERS AND WE NEED TO REBUILD TRUST AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE POLICE AND THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY'RE POLICING. AND SO THE PENDULUM SWINGS CLOSER TO BEING CLOSER TO THAT COMMUNITY. AND THE WAY THIS WAS SO OFTEN DONE WAS THROUGH COMMUNITY POLICING. NOT COMMITTEE PLACE IS A FUNNY THING IF YOU IF YOU ASK A TEN POLICE DEPARTMENTS- NINE OF THEM WILL SAY THEY DO COMMUNITY POLICING IT WILL GIVE YOU A LEVIN DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS OF WHAT IT MEANS. CAN BE POLICING IS VAGUE ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE'S IN FAVOR OF IT BUT NO ONE CAN REALLY TELL YOU WHAT IT MEANS. WELL WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT COMPLETE COMMITTEE PLACING CAN OFTEN BE A BABY IS WHEN IT'S AT ITS BEST. IS INSTEAD OF TOP DOWN IMPOSITION INSTEAD OF POLICE DEPARTMENTS SAYING THIS IS WHAT WE'RE DOING AND THESE ARE THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT. IT'S REACHING OUT TO THE COMMUNITY IN DIALOGUE IN CONVERSATIONS AND YOU TELL US. WHAT ARE THE AREAS OF CONCERN YOU TELL US WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT MAKE YOU FEEL UNSAFE YOU TELL US WHAT WE CAN DO TO REBUILD THAT TRUST. AND ESSENTIAL PART OF THAT WOULD BE THINGS LIKE COMMUNITY MEETINGS. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS FAR TOO OFTEN IN THOSE COMMITTEE MEETINGS. WHAT THEY DEVOLVE INTO. IS COMPLAINT SESSIONS WHERE THE MEMBERS THE COMMUNITY COMPLAIN TO THE POLICE OFFICER THE POLICE. OFFICER STOICALLY TAKES THAT ABUSE AND WALKS OUT AND THE QUESTION IS WELL WHAT'S GETTING DONE. WHAT'S COMING FROM THAT. IT'S JUST A VENTING SESSION THEN THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY REPAIRING THE RELATIONSHIP IT IS JUST A VENTING SESSION WHERE NOT THERE'S NO CONCRETE PROGRESS AND THAT DOESN'T REBUILD TRUST TO THE DOESN'T REBUILD COMMUNITY. AND IN FACT- PERHAPS MORE DANGEROUSLY. WHAT THE CONCERNS RECENTLY HAVE BECOME. IS THAT WHEN IT COMES TO THESE COMMITTEE COMES COMMITTEE POLICING INSTEAD OF IT BEING THE COMMUNITY TELLING POLICE DIRECTING OF POLICE AS TO WHAT OUR INTERESTS ARE WHAT WHAT ISSUES ARE OF INTEREST TO THE COMMUNITY. TOO OFTEN BECOMES A CHECK ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR INTELLIGENCE GATHERING. WHERE INSTEAD THEIR POLICE OFFICERS IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENTS ARE USING THE COMMITTEE MEETINGS TO GATHER INFORMATION TO GATHER INTELLIGENCE. BUT NOT BUT IT'S NOT A TWO WAY STREET. ONCE AGAIN WE RISK LEARNING THE WRONG LESSON. CLOSENESS CAN BE GOOD CLOSENESS CAN BE IMPORTANT WHEN IT TAKES IN IT ESSENTIAL FOR LEGITIMACY AND TRUST. BUT WHEN POLICE USE THAT CLOSENESS. AND PUT IN AND AGAIN THE CONCERN HERE IS NOT NECESSARILY EVEN WHAT'S ACTUALLY OCCURRING BUT WHAT WHAT COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE PERCEIVING. IF COMMITTEE MEMBERS PERCEIVE BUT THE ONLY THING THESE MEETINGS ARE BEING USED FOR IS FOR POLICE OFFICERS. TO GATHER INTELLIGENCE TO MAKE ARRESTS. AS OPPOSED TO LISTENING TO LISTENING TO COMPLAINTS AND LISTENING TO ISSUES THEN YOU RESTORE ROADING THAT TRUST IN A ROADING THAT LEGITIMACY. FINALLY DATA. ONE OF THE GREAT REVOLUTIONS OF POLICING IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES WAS THE USE OF STE SOPHISTICATED STATISTICAL DATA WAS THE RECOGNITION. THAT INSTEAD OF GOING TO BLINDLY GOING OUT FOR A WAITING FOR RADIO THANK PLEASED MORE TO AND MORE PROACTIVE IN THEIR POLICING THAT'S THE LESSON THAT WE LEARNED AND COMPSTAT IN NEW YORK AND SERRA IN SAN DIEGO AND POLICE DEPARTMENTS AROUND THE COUNTRY. BUT THE CONCERN AGAIN SO OFTEN IS WHAT IS THE DATA USED FOR. IF THAT DATA WE SAY OKAY WHERE WE CAN SEND THE POLICE WERE GONNA SEND THE WHERE THE HOT SPOTS ARE WELL HOW DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE HOT SPOTS ARE WHERE THE DATA TELLS US THE HOT SPOTS ARE. HOW DO YOU KNOW HOW DOES THE DATA WITH THE HOT SPOTS ARE WELL THAT'S WERE MADE ARRESTS. WOULD YOU RISK DOING IS LAUNDERING IN. THE SAME KIND OF BIASES. AND THE SAME KINDS OF PATTERNS. OF DISCRIMINATORY POLICING THAT MIGHT HAVE EXISTED BEFORE. IN FACT IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE. THAT YOU HAVE. EVERYONE IN A POLICE DEPARTMENT WITH THE BEST OF INTENTIONS. LOOKING AND SAYING WELL I'M JUST DOING WHAT THE DATE IS TELLING ME TO DO. NOT REALIZING THAT WHAT HAD GOTTEN BAKED INTO THAT WOULD GOTTEN BAKED INTO THE DATA ANALYSIS. WITH THE SAME PATTERNS OF THAT WE SAW IN THE BATTLE DAYS. AT THE SAME TIME THE RESPONSE TO THAT CAN'T BE WILL GET RID OF DATA. IT IS UNFORTUNATELY SI VAT HAPPENING AS WELL. THAT WAS A SCANDAL IN THE NEW YORK NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT A FEW YEARS AGO WITH ADRIAN SCHOOLCRAFT WITH THIS CONCERN ABOUT MANIPULATING THE DATA IN ORDER TO MAKE CRIME STATISTICS LOOK BETTER THAN THEY WERE. FOR AND THAT'S THE CONCERN WE ALSO SEE WITH THE FACT THAT NONE OF US NONE OF US CAN ACTUALLY GIVE YOU A GOOD NUMBER AS TO HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE KILLED BY THE POLICE EVERY YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE ESTIMATES. BUT NONE OF US ACTUALLY KNOW WHY BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE DATA SHOULDN'T WE HAVE THE DATA FOR THAT. THERE ARE SOME THINGS OUR DATA IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL FOR AND THE SOLUTION CAN'T BE TOO TO IGNORE THE DATA. WE NEED MORE DATA DATA IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THESE REFORMS THAT IS CAPACITY BUILDING. BECAUSE BY GETTING GOOD DATA WHAT WE CAN DO. IS MAKE BETTER REFORMS THE FUTURE BECAUSE WE CAN INFORM WHAT THOSE REFORM SHOULD ACTUALLY BE YOU WANT TO KNOW IF THERE'S A PATTERN OF RACIAL PROFILING YOU WANT TO KNOW IF THERE'S ACTUALLY A PATTERN. OF DRIVING WHILE BLACK. WHEN YOU NEED THE DATA TO PROVE THAT. AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE GOOD DATA ON WHAT. WHO YOU'RE STOPPING WHY YOU'RE STOPPING THEM WHAT HAVE ONCE YOU STOP THEM IS AN ARREST MADE WHAT WAS THE BASIS FOR THE ARREST WHAT HAPPENS LONG TERM. WHAT WAS THE CONTEXT OF THE ARREST ALL OF THAT INFORMATION IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL CALIFORNIA HAS DONE GREAT WORK IN RECENT YEARS IN GETTING MORE DATA. BUT THE SOLUTION HAS TO BE TO KEEP GOING. BECAUSE WE DON'T MAKE PROGRESS IF WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING. SO DEPENDENT TO WRAP UP BUT WHAT I'D SAY IS A I'M TEACHING A CLASS RIGHT NOW ON THE HISTORY OF AFTER THE HISTORY OF POLICING WE JUST WRAPPED UP TALKING WITH THE KERNER COMMISSION AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE TALKING WITH THE CHRISTOPHER COMMISSION. A FEW WEEKS FROM NOW WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE FERGUSON REPORT. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MY STUDENTS SAID TO ME AFTER WE FINISH THE KERNER COMMISSION IS. THIS ALL SOUNDS SO RELEVANT. THIS ALL SOUNDS LIKE IT COULD BE HAPPENING NOW. AND I THINK THAT CAN BE A CAUSE FOR PESSIMISM. IT CAN BE A CAUSE FOR PESSIMISM TO SAY HAVEN'T WE LEARNED THE LESSONS FROM FIFTY YEARS AGO WE'RE LOOKING BACK AT CHRISTOPHER HAVEN'T WE LEARNED THE LESSONS FROM THIRTY YEARS AGO. AND THE KEY IS TO LEARN THE RIGHT LESSONS. AND THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT WE LOOK AT HISTORY. IS NOT TO SWING JUST FROM ONE SIDE OF THE PENDULUM TO THE OTHER. BUT RATHER TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON. AND WHAT REFORMS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT FROM THE ACADEMIC PERSPECTIVE THE HISTORY OF POLICE REFORM EFFORTS NEXT UP OUR SECOND PRESENTER WILL BE OUR REEF CON PLEASE- CERTAIN CORRECT ME ON YOUR FIRST YOUR LAST NAME- YOU HAVE UP. TO TWELVE MINUTES TO PRESENT. WE WILL ALSO A MA'AM IN ME AFTER THEIR THIS PANEL WILL OPEN A MEMBER QUESTIONS AND ANSWER OF THOSE WHO PRESENTED SO WITH THAT. THIS CHANGE IN A MICROPHONE. FOR AND PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OFTHE COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY- TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT AFFECTS ALL CALIFORNIANS-IN A VERY PROFOUND WAY MY NAME IS ARIF ALI KHAN I AM THE FORMER DIRECTOR OF CONSTITUTIONAL POLICING IN POLICY OF THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT AND ALSO A FORMER DEPUTY MAYOR OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND HOMELAND SECURITY. I COME TO YOU TODAY TO SPEAK TO YOU BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE OF TWENTY FIVE YEARS AS A FEDERAL PROSECUTOR AS A POLICY ADVISER AND DEVELOPER BOTH AT THE FEDERAL AND LOCAL LEVEL AS A POLICE EXECUTIVE AS THE DIRECTOR OF AIRPORT POLICE LA ACTS WITH ITS FIVE HUNDRED SWORN AND SEVEN HUNDRED CIVILIAN OFFICERS. AND AS A POLICE EXACTLY WITH THE LAPD AS ITS DIRECTOR CONSTITUTIONAL POLICING AND POLICY- I ALSO CURRENTLY ADVISE AND CONSULT LARGE AND SMALL POLICE DEPARTMENTS ON ISSUES REGARDING CONSTITUTIONAL POLICING POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND LEADERSHIP IN PUBLIC SAFETY. WE HEARD TODAY- FROM DOCTOR HANNAH BECAUSE ACTUAL PRESENTATION ON THE THREE THINGS THAT HE SEES AND GREENS FROM HISTORY THERE ARE SO IMPORTANT TO THIS ISSUE OF POLICE REFORM AND I'M GOING TO BUILD ON THAT BY ARE ALSO LOOKING AT THE PRACTICALITIES OF POLICE REFORM. IN CALIFORNIA TODAY BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE AND WHAT I SEE- BUT I THINK WHAT'S RIGHT AND WHAT'S IMPORTANT LOOK AT THIS RIGHT NOW IS THERE'S OFTEN TO TALK ABOUT REIMAGINING POLICING BUT IN MANY WAYS I THINK WE HAVE TO IMAGINE POLICING IN THE WAY THAT BOTH HISTORY AND COMMUNITY HAS EXPECTATIONS. THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT PROFESSOR HANNAH COULD MENTION ABOUT DISCRETION DISTANCE AND DATA THAT EVEN TALKED ABOUT FOR MANY MANY YEARS. BUT THE ONE THEME THAT YOU WILL SEE IN MOST. HISTORY OF. AND REFORM IS THE IDEA OF HAVING A PROFESSIONAL WORK FORCE AND PROFESSIONALISM. IN POLICING. BOTH ON THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL ON THE AGENCY AN INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL AND CERTAINLY ON THE REGULATORY AND STATUTORY FRAMEWORK. THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR. THE PUBLIC EXPECTS AND DESERVES PROFESSIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. BUT UNFORTUNATELY OFTENTIMES THE STANDARDS THE STRUCTURES AND ALL TOO OFTEN THE BEHAVIOR OF OFFICERS. LACKS THAT PROFESSIONALISM. I'VE BEEN VERY HONOR TO HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO INCREDIBLE PROFESSIONALS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT BOTH AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. WITH THE F. B. I. U. S. SECRET SERVICE AND OTHERS. THE MILITARY CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIVE ORGANIZATIONS AND THEN THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF POLICE OFFICERS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. AND IN PARTICULAR MY TIME AT THE L. A. P. D. WHICH IS HALLMARK HAS ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT PROFESSIONALISM FROM. ITS REFORMS THAT IS INSTITUTED AND I MET AND WORKED WITH SOME INCREDIBLE PEOPLE WITH INCREDIBLE TO INTEGRITY AND DEDICATION. WHAT IS THE EVOLUTION OF ITS PROFESSIONALISM THAT I THINK IS INSTRUCTIVE. AND EVEN THOUGH IT SOMETIMES YOU MAY HAVE THE APPEARANCE OF PROFESSIONALISM. IT'S ULTIMATELY THE STANDARDS IN THE STRUCTURAL FORMS THAT ACTUALLY BREED THAT PROFESSIONALISM. THAT YOU CAN SEE IN THE FIELD. AND IT OFTEN WAS FROM THE MANY REFORMS UNDER THE CONSENT DECREE IMPOSED BY THE US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. THE CHANGE OF THE STRUCTURES AND THE STRUCTURAL REFORM. TO HAVE THOSE TYPES OF PROFESSIONAL ASPECTS THAT I THINK ARE IMPORTANT. BUT THERE ARE OF COURSE LIMITATIONS AND STRUCTURAL PRESSURES. THAT HAVE THAT THAT LIMIT THE ABILITY OF ANY ORGANIZATION CALIFORNIA. TO BREED THE PROFESSIONALISM THAT WE ALL WANT AND DESERVE. SO WHAT DO I MEAN BY PROFESSIONALISM. WELL IF YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER PROFESSIONALS- IN OUR SOCIETY WHETHER THEY'RE DOCTORS LAWYERS ENGINEERS OR ACCOUNTANTS. THERE ARE MANY THINGS ABOUT THEM THAT. WE PERHAPS EXPECT OUT OF POLICE OFFICERS BUT DON'T NECESSARILY EXISTENCE CERTAINLY. GIVEN THE SIZE AND THE DIVERSITY OF THE NUMBER OF AGENCIES MAY NOT EXIST. BUT WE EXPECT PROFESSIONALS LIKE IT DOCTOR LAWYER TO BE ABLE TO DIAGNOSE AND SOLVE PROBLEMS. WE EXPECT THEM TO BE EDUCATED IN THEIR FIELD OF EXPERTISE BEFORE THEY EMBARK ON A TRAINING TO BECOME A DOCTOR AN ENGINEER. WE EXPECT THEM TO BE PROVEN WITH SKILLS AND ABILITIES WITH QUALIFICATION STANDARDS- WE EXPECT THEM TO BE LICENSED AND CREDENTIALED. WE DIDN'T EXPECT THEM TO ADHERE TO STANDARDS OF CARE WE EXPECT THEM TO BE CONTEMPORARY AN UP TO DATE WITH WHAT'S GOING ON IN THEIR PARTICULAR FIELD. WE OF COURSE EXPECT ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WE EXPECT THEM TO HAVE EXCELLENT JUDGMENT. AND CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS. AND FINALLY WE EXPECT HEM TO BE UNBIASED AND FREE FROM ANY PREJUDICE AND ALL THE THINGS THAT HAVE PLAGUED OUR SOCIETY FOR SO LONG. WHY DO WE WHY IS BEING PROFESSIONAL SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE BEING A PROFESSIONAL- BUILDS TRUST WITH THE COMMUNITY WE OFTEN DEFER TO THEIR JUDGMENT AND WE HAVE RESPECT AND ADMIRATION FOR THEM- WE OFTEN ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THAT. BUT WE ARE ULTIMATELY ARE HOPING THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ENTRUSTED WITH THESE POWERS CANNOT ONLY PROBLEM TO SOLVE PROBLEMS.BUT CAN APPLY THE LAW OR OR DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES WHEN IT COMES TO POLICING. ON THE INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL WE HAVE MANY OTHER STRUCTURES HOSPITALS CLINICS LAW FIRMS ACCOUNTING FIRMS. THAT SUPPORT THE PROFESSIONALISM OF THOSE. FIELDS AND THEN OF COURSE AT THE STATEWIDE LEVEL SO MANY REGULATORY SCHEMES THAT ENSURE THE PROFESSIONALISM AND THE FACT IS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. NOW FORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA I HAVE TO SAY GIVEN MY INTERACTION AND THE WORK I'VE DONE WITH MANY DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. IS FAR AHEAD ON THE CURVE ON THE ISSUE OF POLICING AND PROFESSIONALISM. WE DO HAVE CALIFORNIA POST WITH ITS STANDARDS WE HAVE MANY AGENCIES THAT HAVE TAKEN IT ON THEMSELVES TO PROMOTE THE IDEA OF PROFESSIONAL POLICING. NOT JUST THE L. A. P. D. BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT'S A VERY LOW BAR. THERE ARE MANY DEPARTMENTS OF THE EIGHTEEN THOUSAND THE UNITED STATES WHERE ACADEMY CERTIFICATION MAY ONLY BE REQUIRED FOR THREE MONTHS SUCH INSTANCE IN SOUTH CAROLINA. WHERE ONE MONTH OF IT IS FULLY ONLINE AND YOU ONLY NEED TO BE CERTIFIED- IN THE ACADEMY WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR OF YOUR ACTUAL SERVICE. CALIFORNIA HAS HIGHER STANDARDS WORK ACADEMIES ARE ONLY GOOD ARE FROM FOUR TO SIX MONTHS. BUT EVEN THAT IS VERY LIMITED WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT WE WANT POLICE OFFICERS TO BE ABLE TO DO. AND MANY OF THE OTHER PROFESSIONAL FACTORS THAT I MENTIONED. ARE LEFT TO THE FOR HUNDRED AND MORE MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED POLICE AGENCIES TO ADOPT AND FIND THE RESOURCES FOR. WHETHER IT'S THE MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR QUALIFYING WITH A FIREARM OR WHATEVER THE EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS ARE TO BECOME A POLICE OFFICER IN THAT CITY. AND IN CALIFORNIA- LIKE IN MANY STATES TO BECOME A POLICE OFFICER THE STATE STANDARD IS ONLY A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA. OR GED E. D. ARE YOU WHAT BEING A U. S. CITIZEN. AND HAVING A BACKGROUND. THAT IS NOT THE STANDARD THAT WE WOULD WANT OF SOMEBODY WHO HAS TO EXERCISE SO MUCH POWER EXERCISED DISCRETION AND USE GOOD JUDGMENT. THE WAY I THINK TO LOOK AT THIS IS A FRAMEWORK WHICH IS TO LOOK AT THE ISSUE OF PROFESSIONALISM ON THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL ON THE AGENCY OR INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL. AND THEN ON THE STATEWIDE LEVEL. WHERE THE LEGISLATURE CAN HELP SUPPORT THIS. OFTENTIMES RIGHT NOW ESPECIALLY WE'RE FOCUSING ON WHAT OFFICER SHOULD NOT BE THEY SHOULD NOT BE BIASED THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE CRIMINAL HISTORIES AND ALL THOSE THE AND VARIOUS THINGS WHICH IS. ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT BUT I ALSO BELIEVE WE HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT SHOULD AN OFFICER B. WHAT DOES A HIGH QUALITY OFFICER LOOK LIKE ACT LIKE AND PERFORM AS THERE ARE MANY OF THEM. BUT AS A STRUCTURE WE DON'T ENCOURAGE THAT. WE SHOULD EXPECT EDUCATION IN THEIR FIELD BEFORE THEY GO TO THE ACADEMY WHETHER IT'S A COLLEGE EDUCATION OR SOME EXPERIENCE ON THE COMPLEX ISSUE. OF CRIME AND POLICING. WE SHOULD AFFECT THE WE SHOULD EXPECT ESSENTIAL SKILLS TO BE TAUGHT IN POLICE ACADEMIES ARE VERY GOOD AT THAT THEY'RE VERY GOOD AT TEACHING THE TECHNICAL SKILLS OF SHOOTING OF DRIVING. OF CONDUCTING ARRESTS BUT ARE THEY EMPHASIZING IN ARE WE RECRUITING AND ENCOURAGING THE CORE FUNCTION OF POLICING WHICH IS. SOLVING WHETHER IT'S COMMUNITY POLICING WHICH IS COLLABORATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING WHETHER IT'S TRYING TO SOLVE A PROBLEM OF A CRIME PROBLEM OR MANY OR ANY OF THE OTHER PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE IMPOSED ON POLICE DEPARTMENTS TO SOLVE. BUT EVEN IF THEY WERE TO BE REMOVED. ISSUES WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND HOMELESSNESS AND ALL THE THINGS THAT VERY LEGITIMATELY ARE BEING DISCUSSED IN PUBLIC POLICY CIRCLES AND IN THE COUNTRY. AT ITS CORE POLICING IS ABOUT PROBLEM SOLVING CRITICAL THINKING AND ULTIMATELY DECISIONS WHETHER IT'S INVESTIGATING A CRIME IN TRYING TO DISCERN WHO IS TELLING THE OF THE TRUTH AND WHO IS LYING. OR ITS CONDUCTING A SEARCH AND SEE OUR X. SEIZURE IN APPLYING THE LAW OR TO MAKING AN ARREST OR CITATION OR OF COURSE WHETHER THEY SHOULD USE FORCE. BUT THE MOST CRITICAL DECISION THAN AN OFFICER IS EXPECTED TO MAKE. WHEN PRESS THAT INPUT TAKE AWAY A LIFE. WHAT DO WE AS A STRUCTURAL MATTER EMPHASIZE THOSE DECISION MAKING SKILLS AND I CAN TELL YOU FROM MY EXPERIENCE ALSO HAVING BEEN GONE THROUGH THE L. A. P. D. ACADEMY. THAT WE DO NOT DO AN ADEQUATE JOB AND CERTAINLY DON'T ENCOURAGE THAT ON A STRUCTURAL LEVEL. AND THAT IS PARTICULARLY TRUE ON THE LAW. DR HANNEKE MENTIONED ABOUT HOW CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLARS DEBATE DIFFERENT ISSUES AND I CONSIDER MYSELF AT LEAST A CONSTITUTIONAL LAWYER. THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT HAVE TO BE APPLIED. BUT TO EXPECT SOMEBODY WITH A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION IN ONLY SIX MONTHS IN THE ACADEMY OF WHICH A SMALL PORTION. INVOLVES ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDING AND APPLYING LAW. IS AN EXPECTATION THAT IS JUST NOT REALISTIC BUT SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULDN'T WE NECESSARILY NEED TO LOOK AT. ON THE INSTITUTIONAL AN AGENCY LEVEL I THINK THE INSTITUTIONS MUST FOCUS ON PROBLEM SOLVING AND CRITICAL THINKING. NOT ONLY ON THE SKILLS BUT ON THESE ISSUES A PROBLEM SOLVING ESPECIALLY WITH THE COMMUNITY. THEY MUST HAVE VALUE IN EDUCATION AND SCREENING A PROMOTION AND IT MUST BE STRUCTURE AROUND THAT. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THE NEED FOR POLICE AGENCIES TO BEAT LEARNING ORGANIZATIONS. LAPD HAS STRUCK ME SO MUCH WHEN I JOIN ABOUT HOW MUCH IT FOCUS ON LEARNING. LEARNING ON INTERNAL INCIDENTS AND ALSO LEARNING FROM OUTSIDE AGENCIES IN ACADEMICS. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS SO CRITICAL BECAUSE YOU CANNOT PREVENT THE NEXT USE OF FORCE. IF YOU DON'T ANALYZE AND ARE SELF CRITICAL ABOUT THE USE OF FORCE THAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY. THEY ALSO HAVE TO ENCOURAGE DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION BECAUSE DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION IS NOT ONLY RIGHT TO REFLECT THE COMMUNITY. WHAT IS SO CRITICAL TO HAVE THAT IF YOU WANT TO SOLVE COMPLEX PROBLEMS. AND THAT. IS CRITICAL IF WE WANT TO SOLVE THESE ISSUES WHETHER IT'S ABOUT CRIME OR MANY OF THE OTHER SOCIETAL PROBLEMS WE HAVE. AND OF COURSE WE NEED OVERSIGHT. THERE HAS TO BE ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSPARENCY AND OVERSIGHT IN ORDER FOR AN ORGANIZATION TO LEARN AND IMPROVE. AND FINALLY I JUST WANT TO SAY ON THE STATEWIDE LEVEL. ONE SIZE CANNOT FIT ALL. NO ALL AGE OF THIS IN THE DO CAN. THE LAPD CANNOT YOU CANNOT HAVE WHAT MAY BE ADEQUATE FOR THEIR APPROPRIATE FOR THE LAPD TO APPLY TO THE NEWPORT BEACH OR TO SHASTA COUNTY. CALIFORNIA'S LARGE DIVERSE IN THEIR VERY MANY DIFFERENT NEEDS OF COMMUNITIES AND AGENCIES. BUT THAT SHOULDN'T STOP THAT THE STATE FROM LOOKING AT THE SAME TYPES OF REGULATORY STANDARDS AND THINGS THAT WE EXPECT OF ALL PROFESSIONALS. MINIMUM STANDARDS TO BECOME A POLICE OFFICER LICENSING CREDENTIALING CERTIFICATION AND YES DECERTIFICATION LIKE WE WOULD ANY OTHER PROFESSIONAL. LEARNING ORGANIZATIONS I'M LOOKING AT HOW TO IMPROVE TACTICS AND OTHER THINGS. ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE SUPPORT AND RESEARCH NECESSARY A FOCUS ON HOW DO WE DEVELOP THE OFFICERS WE WANT. THAT NOT ONLY HAVE THE SKILLS BUT HAVE THE CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS AND THE PROBLEM SOLVING SKILLS THAT WE WANT AND EXPECT OF ALL PROFESSIONALS. SO MY THOUGHT IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT HISTORY I THINK WHAT IT SHOWS IS A CALL TO ACTION. FOR THIS COMMITTEE AND OTHERS TO DO A COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATION THE STRUCTURAL EXAMINATION POLICING. BECAUSE OFTEN THE FRUSTRATION THAT WE SEE ABOUT WHY HASN'T POLICING CHANGED WITH ALL OF THE REFORMS AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES. THIS BECAUSE I THINK WE HAVE TO AT THIS BASIC FACT. THAT WE OFTEN PUT POLICE OFFICERS AND HAVE EXPECTATIONS OF THEM THAT THE STRUCTURE IN OUR SYSTEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND ELSEWHERE. JUST DOES NOT SO PORT. WHO SHOULD BE POLICE OR OFFICERS AND HOW DO WE ENSURE PROFESSIONALISM ON AN INDIVIDUAL INSTITUTIONAL STATEWIDE LEVEL I TRULY BELIEVE IS SOMETHING THAT THIS COMMITTEE SHOULD EXAMINE. CLOSELY AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT I THE POLICE OFFICER POLICE LEADERS AND THE WITH THE- AN EXPANDED THEY EXPECT THESE BASIC CONCEPTS. I THINK REIMAGINE POLICING HIS IMAGINING THE POLICE WE HAVE SEEN THROUGH HISTORY BECAUSE PROFESSIONALISM AND THE URGENCY TO MAKE THE STRUCTURAL FORMS COULD NEVER BE MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN NOW. BEING EDUCATE IN THE FIELD FOCUSING ON PROBLEM SOLVING FOCUSING ON TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY AND DECISION MAKING ESPECIALLY IN USES OF FORCE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THE COLLABORATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING THAT WE EXPECT. I THINK ARE THE KEYS TO REIMAGINING POLICING AND IMAGINE POLICING THAT WOULD COMMUNITIES AND ALL OF US DESERVE. AND WITH THAT I THANK YOU AND I KNOW PROFESSOR HEDICAN IRE HER HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION OR THANK BOTH OF YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION- WE WANTED TO- YOUR PRESENTATIONS ON HISTORY AND POLICE REFORM IN CALIFORNIA AND NATIONALLY. GIVING UP THOSE PERSPECTIVE NOW WE WANT TO BEGIN WITH A PANEL DISCUSSION- EACH PANELIST WILL HAVE UP TO TWELVE MINUTES TO SPEAK- AND MAKE A PRESENTATION- WE WILL GO IN THE ORDER THAT YOU ARE% PRINTED ON THE AGENDA BEFORE PRESENTING.

ABOUT OUR PROFESSION THROUGH ALL THIS WORK WE ARE CAN CONSTANTLY EVALUATING AND SHARING INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT IS WORKING. IN THE AREAS AND THEN WHAT IS AND IN NEED OF IMPROVEMENT OBVIOUSLY THERE ALWAYS IS A NEED FOR IMPROVEMENT. TODAY I'D LIKE TO BRIEFLY. TALK ABOUT THE DIFFERENT AREAS OF POLICING GIVEN AN OVERVIEW OF MAJOR LEGISLATIVE REFORMS. AND DISCUSS THE MOMENT- MOVEMENT IT COMMUNITY ORIENTED POLICING. AND. FINISH IF YOU WILL WITH COMMENTS ABOUT WHAT'S GOING OPERATIONAL CHANGES WITH OUR THAT'S WITH EVERY LONG CHANGE OVER TIME. MOST READ POLICE AS FROM ALMOST FOCUSED ON CRIME PREVENTION WHICH HAS WHICH REALLY WAS THE RESULT OF THE HIKE RATE THE FINAL DECADES OF THE TWENTIETH TO FOCUS IN IT THIS ON THE PLEASE WITHIN THE LAST. ONE TO FIFTY TWENTY. NO OTHER PROFESSION I'VE- OR OR EACH YEAR HAS AT MAJOR GIPSON ALL OF THE LONG. AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THE LAST DECADE ESPECIALLY CAL. ALTHOUGH NOT ALL THESE DIRECTLY RELATED TO POLICE OPERATION THEY ALL HAVE AN IMPACT. OF THE DAY TO DAY ACTIONS OF OUR AGENCIES IN PEACE TALKS WITH FARC FRANKLY EVEN OUR COMMUNITY. IT START WITH THE- IF THE DETENTION POLICY WITH AB. ONE OH NINE IF YOU LET. WE'VE BEEN GROWING ARE GROWING FOCUS ON LEGISLATION TO REFORM OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. CALIFORNIA ALSO PASSED PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WHICH DRAMATICALLY. CHANGED OUR PENALTIES ON DRUG POSSESSION AND CONSUMPTION ITSELF WHICH IS RESULT IN A NUMBER OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. ONE OF THEM BEING A MAJOR- ONE BEING BE A REDUCTION OF PARTICIPATION IN DRUG COURT. I HAVING BEEN A MEMBER NORTH HERE IN THE DRUG COURT. I GOT CAN K. YOU THAT THE BOTH. IT ISN'T US THE DEGREE AND THEN WE NEED. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE TO GIVE YOU. FREE THE CAN OF. AND THE DISABILITY CONSTRAIN OF THE A DRUG THAT THE ABUSE AND ALL THE OVER THAT ARE OCCURRING OUR COUNTRY NATIONWIDE. WE'VE ALSO SEEN LEGISLATION TO ESTABLISH AN INCREASE YOU DEFENDER AN ELDERLY PROGRAMS INCREASE COMPASSIONATE THE LEAVES. AN ESTABLISHED THE BURDEN PROGRAMS AROUND THE STATE. WE'VE REDUCE PENALTIES ON DRUG SELVES CRIMES INVOLVING FIREARMS BELIEVE. FOR CALIFORNIANS IN CASES INVOLVING ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS AND CIVIL ASSET FORFEITURE. WE'VE SET ASIDE- WITH THAT STATEWIDE RULES GOVERNING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FEDERAL AGENCIES ON IMMIGRATION. AND SET RESTRICTIONS ON INFORMATION SHARING WITH HOMELAND SECURITY MORE SPECIFICALLY WITH ICE. STEP RULES FOR WITNESS INTERROGATIONS LINEUPS IN CUSTODY- INTERVIEWS WITH JUVENILES. ARE TRAINING MANDATES WORK OUT OF THE RECRUITERS GROWN ALMOST EVERY YEAR- NOW INCLUDING MENTAL HEALTH TRAINING AND RACIAL IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING AMONG OTHERS. OUR SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY SYSTEM HAS BEEN COMPLETELY REDESIGNED AND MODERNIZED. TO BE A VERY SECURE SYSTEM THAT WE'RE AWARE OF. OUR STATEWIDE- CAL GANG DATABASES BEEN PURGING AND RESET UNDER NEW CRITERIA CONTROLS. WE ARE SEVERAL YEARS IN THE PROCESS OF HAVING BOND FOR A COLLECT NEW AND DETAILED INFORMATION ON USE OF FORCE. AND RACIAL IDENTITY OF ANYONE. BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. ARAJ HAS LEGALIZED CANNABIS CONNECT WRECK IN THE- WE'VE A OF FOR THE RELEASE OF POLICE PERSONNEL FILES WHICH MANY OF YOU CAN RECALL THAT MAY. REQUIRE THE PITCHES MOTION AND NOW. ARE THE AGENCIES TO POST ALL THEIR INTERNAL UP WE'VE POLICIES ONLINE. THEY MAY TRANSPARENT EVERY OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTING INVESTIGATION WE HAVE ELIMINATED OUR FIRST DEGREE MURDER WILL ALLOW FOR NEW TRIALS IN THOSE CASES. WE'VE CHANGED CRIMINAL OR JURISDICTIONS OVER MINERS VOTERS OF. ALSO PASSED PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN WHICH IS A LOT FOR THE EARLY EARLY RELEASE OF OFF BALANCE NOT ON THE LIST OF VIOLENT. FELONIES WHICH MAKES ACTUALLY. BILL DOUBLE DOUBLE WHO HAVE BEEN CAN OF RAPE OR- UNCONSCIOUS ARE KNOWN IN. THE MYSTIC VIOLENCE- THEN I CLEARLY EARLY BECAUSE- WE'D ALREADY HAD THE- THE MERIT SYSTEM OR THE CREDIT SYSTEM. FOR INMATES- THAT WOULD WITHOUT RELIEF AND BASED ON THEIR- CONTACT AND GOOD CONDUCT WITHIN. WALKING A KERN ST IT NOW WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT DOESN'T- WE WERE WE DON'T EVEN LOOK AT ENHANCEMENTS AS SUCH AS THE RESULT OF PROP FIFTY SEVEN. WE HAVE LIMITED MAJORITY OF PROPERTY PROBATION AND PAROLE- TERMS AND- I DON'T. ELIMINATED DOESN'T FIND AND FEES THAT HOW PAY FOR NUMEROUS. SHAKY PRO INCLUDING LONG TRAINING. WE HAVE- PASSED LEGISLATION TO IN OUR MONEY BAIL SYSTEM. WE BAND THEN I WHEN I SAY WE I'M TALKING ABOUT WE HAVE BEEN CALIFORNIANS SOME OF THE STUFF WE'VE ACTUALLY CALIFORNIA WHICH IS ACTUALLY TAKING- AS BEEN INVOLVED INDIRECTLY WITH THE LEGISLATION IN THIS IS GOING TO HELP. IF SOME OF THE STUFF PASSED. BUT WE PAN FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE IN THE USE OF CAROTID RESTRAINT- AND CHOKEHOLDS. RECENTLY WE HAVE DOZENS OF NEW FIREARM LAWS THAT ARE OFFICERS AND AGENCIES WILL SOUND. WE'VE INCREASED THE DIGITAL DISCRETION AND NOW ALLOWED THE VIRGIN AGAINST PROSECUTORS OBJECTIONS. AND FINALLY WE HAVE WRITTEN ARE OUTDATED YOU SUPPORT STATUTES AND CREATED THE NATION'S MOST COMPREHENSIVE USE OF FORCE POLICY REQUIREMENTS IN THE NATION. SB TWO THIRTY THREE THOUSAND NINETEEN WITHOUT YOU SPONSORED BANDITS OFFICER DE ESCALATE WHEN PEOPLE RENDER MEDICAL AID INTERVENE AGAINST EXCESSIVE FORCE UTILIZED PROPORTIONAL FORCE PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON DEALING WITH HIGH RISK POPULATIONS. OF THE USE OF FORCE TRAINING THEM AND REPORTING AND MUCH MORE MUCH MORE THE- VERY COMPREHENSIVE WE'VE NOT ALWAYS. SEEN EYE TO EYE WITH LEGISLATORS OBVIOUSLY OF THESE MEASURES THAT ON MANY OCCASIONS WE HAVE WORKED COLLABORATIVELY. TO ACHIEVE SHARED GOALS OF FINDING ALTERNATIVES TO INCARCERATION THAT STILL SUPPORT PUBLIC SAFETY. HOWEVER THERE IS NOT BEEN ANY THOROUGH REVIEW OF THESE OVERALL IMPACT ON THE CRIMINAL. JUSTICE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE. IN THE DARK THAT THEIR SOME SUCCESS MEASURES AND SOME CONTACT. THAT NEED TO ADDRESSED. IF WE ARE TO KEEP LOOKING. MOVING FOR AND WE WILL BE CONTINUE TO MOVE ALL THE SNOW ON THE ALL. WITH MORE CHANGE. THE POLICE. THEIR NEED TO BE A REFLECTION ON WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN ACCOMPLISHED AND WHAT THESE IMPACTS HAVE. ADD UP TO OUR COMMUNITIES OVERALL CRIME STATISTICS REMAIN WELL BELOW WHAT THEY WERE IN THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES. BUT THAT IS NOT THE FULL MEASUREMENT OF SUCCESS NOR DOES IT MEAN EVERYTHING HAS WORKED OUT PERFECTLY OBVIOUSLY. WE HAVE EXAMPLES FROM ACROSS THE STATE OF GAPS HOLES. WORK JUSTICE SYSTEMS NOW FAILING TO CORRECT CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR- OR COUGHING AGENCIES TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WITHOUT MEASUREMENTS OF SUCCESS. THE HOMELESSNESS AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE PRACTICES GROW WORSE EVERY YEAR. AND WE'VE NOT FOUND ADEQUATE SUPPORT RESOURCES FOR THOSE ON THE STREETS AND IN THIS BILL AND STILL IN NEED- WE'VE ALSO CONTINUE TO PLACE MORE MORE REQUIREMENTS ON A POLICE OFFICERS BUT NOT. ALWAYS GIVEN THE AGENCY THAT'S TALKED ABOUT EARLIER- THE OR THE INDIVIDUALS RESOURCES THEY TRULY NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL. AND THESE ARE FAR FROM THE ONLY CHANGES THAT WE'VE SEEN IN LONG COURSE THAT YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT A- THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY POLICING REPORT RELEASED IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN HIGHLIGHTED. BEST PRACTICES AND SMART APPROACHES TO HELP RENEW. A NATIONAL FOCUS ON COMMUNITY POLICING INCLUDING IS BEEN VERY BIG LIKE I WOULD SPOKE EARLIER ON IN THE- THE RIGHT AT THE TURN OF THE- AT THE BEGINNING OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. CONCEPTS THAT WERE VAGUELY FAMILIAR UNIVERSAL THINGS SUCH AS WE PLEDGING TO MISSING BUT YOU DON'T JUSTICE COMMUNITY OVERSIGHT. AN OFFICER WELLNESS. MANY OF YOU CONCEPT CAME FROM. LEVEL WHERE THE WITHIN THE IN WAYS IMPROVED REALLY. BETWEEN THE AFFECTED GROUPS LONG. HELP HAD MANY. THE POLICE JUST IF OF. IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE- OF MY POLICE. ACTIVITY THAT WERE IN INCOME. IN GROWTH EVERY. THE CHANGES HAVE BEEN REFLECTED IN THE CULTURAL AND OPERATIONAL STEPS IF WE'VE MADE. AGENCIES ACROSS OUR STATE. IT'S BEING CALLED THEN OPERATIONAL CHANGES INTERNALLY. AGENCIES HAVE ADAPTED TO THE NEW REQUIREMENTS AND ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES BY SPECIALIZING UNITS AND CAPABILITIES. FOR EXAMPLE THE USE OF HOMELESS LIAISON OFFICERS OR MULTI DISCIPLINARY STRIKE TEAMS HAS GROWN SUBSANTIALLY. IN ADDITION OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH VERY FEW PROGRAMS IN JUVENILE DIVERSION INTO BECOME MORE WIDESPREAD. THERE'S BEEN AN INCREASED FOCUS ON RECRUITING THE NEXT GENERATION OF PEACE OFFICERS. THAT ARE MORE DIVERSE AND REPRESENTATIVE THE COMMUNITY. FINALLY OUR TRAINING IS BECOME MORE REALISTIC OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM BY INCLUDING THESE THE SIMULATORS AND REAL LIFE SCENARIOS THAT ALTHOUGH. THERE IS- THE REQUIREMENT IS THAT THE ONLY HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION WE'RE FINDING THAT MORE AND MORE OF OUR OFFICERS. ARE COMING TO US WITH THE WITH THE EDUCATION A LITTLE BIT LATER IN LIFE THEN- THE TWENTY ONE BECAUSE OF HAVING TO GO TO COLLEGE. EARLY INCLUDES I GUESS OVERALL TO BE PROUD OF WHAT WE HAVE. IN TAKE NOTE OF THE MAY REFORM WE'VE ARE ENACTED. THAT IS NOT TO SAY THERE IS A MORE THAT CAN BE DONE OBVIOUSLY SUCH AS THE CREATION OF A STATE WIDE THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS FOR OFFICERS. FOR MR TARIQ MISCONDUCT. BUT OUR NEXT STEP SHOULD BE DONE IN CONTEXT WITH WHAT HAS TAKEN PLACE. IN IN REVIEW OF WHAT IS AND ISN'T WORKING. IN I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE TIME MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE IN. I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AFTER THE R. SPEC BUT AS OF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WAS KNOWN AS PRE ST YOUR COMMENTS- I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU- AND AGAIN PRECIADO YOU WALKING US THROUGH WHAT HAS TAKEN PLACE AND THEN I'LL INVITE MY COLLEAGUES TO ALSO CHIME IN WITH QUESTIONS FOR. THOSE WHO'VE ALREADY- TESTIFIED- THUS FAR. THE FIRST QUESTION I HAVE FOR YOU IS NEW YEARS IS WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT COMMUNITY BASED POLICING. IN YOUR MIND DOES IT WORK THAT'S THE FIRST QUESTION ABOUT COMMUNITY BASED POLICING DOESN'T WORK. YEAH I NEED IT I CAN TELL YOU THIS MUCH THAT NOT ONLY DOES IT WORK. IT YEAH WHAT WE DO FOR A LIVING THAT POLICE OFFICERS. WE IT. ESPECIALLY NOW BUT IT ANYTIME COURT YOU CAN'T. WE CAN'T BE EFFECTIVE IN DOING WHAT WE DO WE DON'T HAVE THE COMMUNITY HELPING US. TO HELP NOT ONLY IENTIFY PROBLEMS UT FRAME THOSE PROBLEMS BECAUSE I THINK THE PROBLEMS HAVE TO BE FAINT- FRAMED APPROPRIATELY SO THAT WE ACTUALLY DO COME UP WITH. YOU KNOW EFFECTIVE A MEANINGFUL SOLUTION TO THESE ISSUES AND ALSO THE COMMUNICATION THAT GOES BACK AND FORTH SO THAT WE UNDERSTAND. THE PERSPECTIVE FROM WHICH WE ARE WHICH WE ARE CRAVING THOSE PROBLEMS FROM AND IT NEEDED AND THE NEED FOR THAT. CAN ONLY COME THROUGHOUT REACHED IN CONSTANT AND THEN RELATIONSHIP BUILDING. AND YEAH I DO BELIEVE I DO BELIEVE THE WORK I DO BELIEVE THAT IT NEEDS- MORE WORK AND I DO BELIEVE THAT- ONLINE I THINK IT WAS THE- FITS BOTH EARLIER. ABOUT THIS HI THIS ISSUE BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO A- MORE POSSIBLY MORE TRAINING IN- IN EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND LEARNING HOW TO INCREASE THE LEVEL OF THE MOST INTELLIGENT. NOT ONLY WITHIN OUR OFFICERS BUT I THINK YOU KNOW WITHIN OUR PUBLIC AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT WE DO FOR A LIVING. AND HOW THAT'S. NOT MEANT TO GET DONE. THANK YOU VERY JUST GOING OFF MY OWN X. AND SERVE THE CITY MAY WILL. THERE WAS. ARE AND CAPTAIN THEY DEMANDED THAT US THAT WE GET OUT OF THE CAR. I KNEW THE LOPEZ FAMILY I KNEW THE GARCIA FAMILY I KNEW- THE HERNANDEZ FAMILY AND THAT. ABSOLUTELY MADE ME I THINK ABOUT A POLICE OFFICER DURING THAT TIME AND ALSO YOU PROMOTED I THINK COMMUNITY BASED POLICING IN THAT EFFORT SO- I DO BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO STRENGTHEN THAT WE NEED TO CERTAINLY ENCOURAGE THAT. IN ALL DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS THE SECOND QUESTION I HAVE FOR YOU IS WHAT IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO EXTRAPOLATIONS FROST. BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE COMMUNITY. WHAT ARE- DEPARTMENTS DOING TO IMPROVE AND HAT AND WHAT HAS WORKED. IN YOUR OPINION. WELL AT OKAY ONE THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS IS THIS TRANSPARENCY. IS TO BE OPEN. WITH YOUR COMMUNITY I THINK YOU KNOW SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ORIGINALLY WERE. PROBABLY THERE WAS SOME PUSHBACK WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT ON A LIKE FOR YOU KNOW. PUBLISHING OUR POLICIES ONLINE AND DOING THOSE THINGS I THINK THERE THAT THE PERFECT EXAMPLE WHAT WE- WE HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE. I MEAN YOU KNOW THE WE'RE NOT GIVING OUT- TACTICAL INFORMATION AS YET YOU KNOW- ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON. HAVING BEEN IN LONG COURSE BUT WE'RE NOT DOING THAT. THE KIND OF THING WHERE WE ARE WE'RE JUST SHOWING THEM OUR PROCEDURES ARE POLICIES HOW WE GET THINGS DONE. I THINK THE FACT AND I THINK ALL THE DIFFERENT COMMUNITY. EVENTS THAT WE ACTUALLY HOST THAT THE CITY. IN OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT TAKING PART IN THAT BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BECOME. PART OF THE COMMUNITY YOU CAN'T JUST LEAVE THE COMMUNITY. AND I THINK. WHAT I'VE SEEN IS ONE OF ONE POLICE FOR. THE DEPARTMENT THAT CAN WORK WELL THAT THAT THE THAT THEY HAVE A FORMAL- COMMUNITY POLICING. PROGRAMS BUT IT BE INFORMAL I THINK THAT WORKS BEST IS WHEN YOU ACTUALLY. DO THE THINGS THAT YOU SAID AND GET OUT YOUR CAR AND ACTUALLY GO OUT AND HAVE A CONVERSATION THE- KIND OF THE COFFEE WITH A COP IF YOU WILL. IN THE MEANTIME WITH YOUR PUBLIC- I THINK THE OTHER THING TOO IS. THE MEETING WHEN YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING. RIGHT IN AT THE AT THE END AN AGENT. YOU KNOW I IN B. STAR. FOR THE HAPPEN IN I KNOW THAT THE SOMETIMES TURN A TURN OR TURN YOU KNOW CITY IT'S- AND- ALL THE PEOPLE THAT ARE PART OF THE HIGHER TO PROTECT CITIES AND- AND OTHER THINGS AND AN APARTMENT. YOU KNOW DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT BECAUSE OF LIABILITY ISSUES BUT I THINK YOU NEED TO SPEAK OUT TO THE PEOPLE. AROUND THAT WERE MOST IMPACTED BY BUT WHATEVER ACTIONS WE TOOK WHETHER THEY WERE JUSTIFIED OR NOT. YOU YEAH ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE JUSTIFIED I MEAN THEY'RE JUSTIFIED YOU NEED TO STILL GO OUT AND- TALK ABOUT WHAT. WHAT YOU DID BECAUSE SOMETIMES- THE END RESULT OF THOSE- JUSTIFIED ACTIONS. ARE STILL FEEL FOR BOTH THE EVERYBODY INVOLVED INCLUDING THE OFFICER- SO I THINK YOU NEED TO SHARE IN THE PAIN. ARE ENSURING THAT COMMUNICATION. THANK YOU FOR MUCH SECOND CLUE MICHAEL OVER UP TO THE MAY. THE FIRST ONE IS MISS GONZALEZ AFTER WILL BE MR LACKEY AND THEN AFTER MITCHELL LACK WE HAVE MISTER MAYES AND MEMBERS IFYOU WANT TO BE. OKAY JUST LET ME KNOW THANK YOU. I'M SHIFTING AS I HAVE A QUESTION SPECIFICALLY- HOPEFULLY YOU CAN ANSWER I WOULD THINK AS A POLICE CHIEF BUT- I WHAT I WANT TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE HISTORY OF POLICE OFFICER A PEACE OFFICER DISCIPLINE IN CALIFORNIA- HAS GOTTEN HARDER HAS GOTTEN EASIER TO DISCIPLINE OFFICERS WHAT'S THE- IT. WHAT WE HAVE THERE LIKE WHAT'S HAPPENED WHERE WHERE HAS IT GONE. RIGHT I THINK WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS PROBABLY- A DISPLAY- AND LIKE IN ANY INDUSTRY THAT YOU KNOW OF WHAT. WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS. THE CREATION OF LAWS THAT PROTECT EMPLOYEES IN GENERAL RIGHT AND- IN IN IN SOME OF THOSE LAWS THAT HAVE PROVIDED PROTECT THEY WERE WELL INTENDED IN GOOD MEETING AND ACTUALLY SERVE A PURPOSE- BUT IT ALSO MADE IT THE CONSEQUENCES OF. SOME OF THOSE PROTECTIONS THAT IT MADE IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT. FOR CHIEFS OF POLICE SAY SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DRAFTING IS- A HOW TO HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE IN AND- BECAUSE YOU COULD EASILY. DECIDED THE CHANGE THAT HEY WE'RE GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND WE WANT TO YOU WANT IT NOW THEY ARE TERMINATE SOMEBODY. BUT THEN YOU HAVE ALL THESE DIFFERENT BOARDS- THE HELP THAT THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH AND MEDIATORS SOMETIMES AND IF THE PEOPLE WIND UP FIGHTING GETTING THEIR JOBS BACK. YOU KNOW SOMETIMES A TECHNICALITIES DOOR- JUST BECAUSE SOME- I'M IN A MEDIATOR JUST FELT LIKE THEY COULD GET GIVEN A SECOND CHANCE. AND SO THAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT. FOR A CHEAP TO DO THEIR JOB AND I THINK THAT THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS THAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN AND- IT CERTAINLY WOULD. WOULD HELP- GO ALONG WAY THAN TRYING TO- PROTECT THE COMMUNITY. AND ALLOW US TO DO THAT I THINK THAT THE- EVERYTHING BECOME MORE SOPHISTICATED. IN OUR WORLD AND THE LEVEL OF SOPHISTICATION IN TERMS OF EMPLOYEE RIGHTS AND- AND THE LEGAL- THE LEGAL ISSUES THAT GO BEHIND THAT HAVE BECOME MORE COMPLEX AND SO. WE DEAL WITH THE MUCH MORE COMPACT SYSTEM THAN WE DID BEFORE SAY. IN THE SIXTIES WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT- WELL WHAT THE NEGATIVE CAMPAIGNING BEFORE THAT IF THEY WANTED TO TERMINATE SOMEBODY A LOT OF TIME TO GET. IT FIREMAN IN YOUR ALMOST EVERYBODY WAS THAT THE THING WE AT WILL EVEN THOUGH THEY WEREN'T BUT- THAT'S NOT WHAT. IT APPEARS. REPLY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YEAH THANK ACHIEVE NEAR I JUST A QUICK COME FOLLOWED BY A I DO BELIEVE VERY VERY. HE PLAYED THE COMMUNITY POLICING OF DOWN PROPERLY ASSEMBLY RELATIONSHIP BUILDING. AND IT'S HARD TO ACCOMPLISH BECAUSE OF TRUST BARRIERS THAT. THAT EXIST- OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME MY QUESTION WOULD BE HOW TO OFFICERS OR DEPUTIES DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY'RE GENERALLY COMMITTED TO BEING A SERVANT VERSES JUST KNOW FOR SURE. IT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND ONE OF OUR LACK OF THE BABY. I THINK. THANK YOU HAPPEN EVERYDAY TO BE HONEST WITH YOU- I SEE THEM BECAUSE- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'LL TELL YOU MY OWN PERSONAL- RESPECTIVE IN THE WAY THAT I DO WITH IT HERE. I TEACH THESE GUYS AT LEAST OF THE PHILOSOPHY THAT I HAVE IS THAT WE'RE NONE OF US ARE EXPERTS AT HUMAN DIGNITY AND NONE OF US ARE EXPERTS AT REASONABLE NATIONAL COURTS DECIDE REASONABLENESS ALL THE TIME THEY CHANGE THAT BAR. OR THAT THEY CHANGE THE LINE- AND ALSO LIKE TO BELIEVE WE'RE EXPECTED HIM DIGNITY BUT I'M NOT CERTAIN THAT WE ARE THE WE CAN ALL BE EXPERTS AT THE SEARCH TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN REASONABLENESS IN HUMAN DIGNITY. AND IT'S KIND OF LIKE IMPORTING THE LETTER LAW VERSUS THE SPIRIT OF ALL AND IT'S ALSO KIND OF LIKE. STARTLES YOU KNOW- FOR OVERTURE I BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT AND I THEN I TELL THEM THIS IS THAT. WHAT THE WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THESE LOG IN WHAT IS IT THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH- SO EVEN IN THE ENFORCEMENT SIDE OF THEM YOU KNOW OF THE LAW AND THEN FOR. IT SHOULD BE. WITH A REASONABLE AS AND THEN TO BALANCE HUMAN DIGNITY ON THE OTHER SIDE YOU'RE RIGHT I BELIEVE THAT- I BELIEVE YOU'RE CORRECT IN SAYING THAT IT IS ABOUT RELATIONSHIP BUILDING AND THE WAY YOU WILL BUILD THOSE RELATIONSHIPS IF YOU DON'T WAIT UNTIL THE- THE CRISIS HAPPENS AND THEN YOU START REACHING OUT AND- AND DOING ALL THE STUFF AND TRYING TO GARNER THAT YOU AVE TO DO IT EVERY DAY. AND SO- THEN BILL THAT BILL THAT- THAT ACCOUNT IF YOU WILL THAT SAVINGS ACCOUNT OF GOOD WILL WITH YOUR COMMUNITIES SO ANY BETTER DO THAT WITH THE TRUTH. AND THEN YOU KNOW IT'S PAINFUL THAT IS FOR SOME PEOPLE SOMETIMES YOU KNOW THAT WOULD YOU HAVE TO DO YOU HAVE TO GIVE YOU HAVE TO ADDRESS THE REAL SITUATIONS THE DATA THAT'S THERE AND SHARE THE DATA YOU KNOW. LIKE YOU SUPPORT STUFF BUT I THINK THAT THE WE HAVE TO DO THAT WITH OUR WITH OUR COMMUNITIES AND WE HAVE TO HAVE FORMAL ENGAGEMENTS WITH THEM. AND WE HAVE TO ALSO HAVE A LOT OF THE INFORMAL- RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM. IN TERMS OF JUST GETTING OUT OF THE CAR AND IN AND MEETING WITH FOLKS. BUT I THINK IT'S THE JOB OF EVERY G. I BELIEVE AND THEN AND THEN THEN. OF MEASURE THE THERE. ARE DEFINITELY GONNA. ARGUE OUT THERE. AND IN MEETING WITH THE PUBLIC N. THE AND THE EXTRA TIME. WITH THEM- ONE EVEN FOR CALLS FOR SERVICE YOU KNOW WHEN THEY CAN I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME CITIES ARE MORE IMPACTED THAN SAY SOMETHING WERE LIKE LOS ALAMEDA AS- FAR MY OFFICE IS HAVE THE TIME. THIS IS SPEAK WITH PEOPLE BUT EVEN GIVEN THAT TIME SOMETIMES OFFICES DON'T SO THAT'S WHY IF YOU HAVE THE TIME TAKE THE TIME. AND I JUST BELIEVE THAT THAT'S THE BEST THE BEST YOU CAN BE ON THE AND THAT AND BE ABLE TO- FAITH THIS BRINGS AN ARROW THAT ARE COMING OUR WAY KNOWING THAT. THEY MAY BE. MISPLACED ENDANGER MAYBE MISPLACED BUT YOU YOU HAVE TO UNDER OF WHAT PEOPLE ARE GOING THROUGH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISSED MAYES. WELL THANK YOU G. FOR- FOR BEING A PART OF- THIS TODAY- I WANT TO TALK ABOUT- ABOUT EDUCATION DUMB AND TRAINING- JUST A LITTLEBIT WE HEARD FROM A MISTER ERIC KAHN. IN REGARDS TO THE AMOUNT OF TIME- THAT IT TAKES IF IT TO GET TO GET TRAINED. AT A FEW MONTHS AGO AXES BY THE BEGINNING OF THE SUMMER IS ALL OF THESE THINGS BEGAN TO ATTEMPT TO BOIL UP- I HAD- MY FIANCE'S SISTER WHO LIVES IN AUSTRALIA- SENT ME. A I MEAN THAT SHE HAD SEEN ONLINE THAT SAID IT DID IT DID THAT A COSMETOLOGIST IN CALIFORNIA. AND HAS HAVE TWICE THE HOURS. NEEDED THEN THAT A POLICE OFFICER TO GET POST TRAINING AND I THOUGHT WELL THAT CAN'T BE TRUE- AND I REMEMBER LOOKING IT UP AND IF YOU ACTUALLY SEE THE NUMBER OF HOURS OF. OF TRAINING THAT ACTUALLY IS TRUE. SO I'VE ALSO HEARD FROM MY LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. THAT THEY'RE HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME IN MY TO COUNTIES HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME. TRYING TO RECRUIT- NUME THE NEW OFFICERS. AND SO WE'RE THINKING ABOUT. TRAINING IN THE AMOUNT OF TIME TO BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH THROUGH POST STORE- ARE. IS IT EVEN. IS IT SOMETHING THAT'S NECESSARY TO HAVE MORE EDUCATION DO WE NEED COLLEGE DEGREES FOR POLICE OFFICERS I DO WE NEED ASSOCIATE'S DEGREES FOR OUR POLICE OFFICERS MISTER ERIC CONTACT ABOUT CRITICAL THINKING HE TALKED ABOUT THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO MAKE DECISIONS VERY VERY QUICKLY- BUT DOES THERE NEED TO BE MORE EDUCATION IT IS THE POST TRADING- SUFFICIENT AND THEN WHERE THE RESOURCES COME TO BE ABLE TO. DO THAT EDUCATION AND TRAINING SO WANTED TO JUST. HAVE YOU DRESS THAT. YES OKAY ARE UP BURKE SAY THAT. THAT FOR THE M. NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY HOURS ARE THERE ABOUT FOR- CAFE MOST OF THEM ARE LIKE GOLDEN WEST WHERE I- STRUCK THAT- THEY AVE WELL OVER A THOUSAND HOURS. HAVING THAT THEY GO THROUGH BY THE TIME THEY FINISH THEIR SIX MONTH PROGRAM AND THEN THEY GO INTO A FIELD TRAINING OFFICER PROGRAM. WHICH FOR MOST- POLICE DEPARTMENT AT LEAST THREE MONTHS- MARC TWELVE WEEKS ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME AGENCIES THAT WILL REQUIRE SIX MONTHS ON TOP OF THAT SO. THERE'S A BODY YEARS SOMETIMES BETWEEN THE TIME THAT THE PERSON. IT'S VOTE ON A CASH UNTIL THEY'RE ACTUALLY ON THEIR OWN- MAKING DECISIONS AND DRIVING ALONE IN A IN A POLICE VEHICLE SO- COULD THERE BE MORE TRAINING YEAH I CERTAINLY TINK YOU KNOW IT- SO MANY TIMES THAT I'VE BEEN EVEN IN MY PROFESSION WHEN I AND EVEN AS A CHEAT. YOU KNOW YOU YOU'RE CHEAP FOR A COUPLE YEARS AND THEN YOU REALIZE THAT. YOU DON'T KNOW AS MUCH AS YOU SHOULD KNOW AND YOU AND THEN THE SAME THING AS AN OFFICER. YOU KNOW- I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE MILITARY MODEL I THINK IN AND YOU KNOW YOU HAVE. YOU HAVE- ENLISTED FOLKS THAT DON'T REQUIRE- A DEGREE BUT THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE COMMANDER THEM CERTAINLY DO AND THAT'S WHAT YOU EXPECT- I DON'T NECESSARILY EXPECT ALL OF OUR GUYS- TO HAVE COLLEGE DEGREES COMING IN BECAUSE IT'S NOT A REQUIREMENT BUT THAT SEEMS LIKE WE DO GET A NUMBER OF FOLKS THAT. ARE COLLEGE EDUCATED BECAUSE YOU'RE ENTERING THE PROFESSION LATER IN LIFE. AND DID DECIDE TO GO THROUGH A CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROGRAM I CAN TELL YOU THE DIFFERENCE IN THAT YOU KNOW. THE APPLICATION LOG VERSES KNOWING THEORETICALLY WHAT THE LAW SAYS. THERE'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE AND THAT'S WHERE THAT THAT ON THE JOB TRAINING AND I DON'T THE- FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT I'VE BEEN SURE WHAT WHERE THE YOU KNOW WE'RE- IT'S NOT THE TIME YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW IN OUR STATE. IN OR ANYWHERE IN OUR NATION. WITH WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE COVER NINETEEN AND THEN TO SEE WHAT OUR- REVENUE STREAMS HAVE BEEN DRYING UP IN AND- TALK ABOUT THAT NECESSARILY BUT- HI. I KNOW THAT THE RE ORDERING OF OUR TRAINING. IS IMPORTANT IN HAND KIND OF PRIORITIZING AND I'VE SEEN POSTS DO THAT- I SPOKE ABOUT EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND- AND- AND I REALLY FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT THAT I HAD READ AN ARTICLE THAT WAS PUBLISHED ON THAT. AND SAYING THAT IT'S A REQUIRE IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT'S- REALLY STRICTLY TESTED. N. M. ELEMENTS OF IT ARE. IN THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION. BUT IT'S REALLY SOMETHING BIG- FOR RECRUITMENT BUT- MORE SO FOR EVEN FOR PROMOTIONAL OPPORTUNITIES- YEAH I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THEY MAY HAVE MORE TRAINING YET AND- BETTING CARE- BUT I DON'T KNOW. IF IT'S BECAUSE THEY NEED MORE HOURS FOR THEIR TRAINING- TO LEARN THAT TOPIC BUT YOU KNOW YEAH- CERTAINLY- YOU KNOW THE IT. I GUESS BE AT THE LEVEL OF. A YOU KNOW AND I. THINK GERAKAN WOULD TALKING YOU KNOW LIKE BEING IN A- IN THAT. HAVE GONE TO LAW SCHOOL. THE AMOUNT OF CRUDE LAW THE NOW. WITH COVER. IN THEIR SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. IT'S PROBABLY THAT TO OUR THAN MAYBE SOME OF GOING TO GETTING TO A LOT. YOU KNOW AND SO THERE IS A VERY. FORM OF LEARNING. AND THERE ARE CERTAIN CAST YOU THEY HAVE TO HAVE TO BE HAD. AND THAT'S WHY LAW ENFORCEMENT AS A IS SUCH A COMPLICATED- PROFESSION. IT IS COMPLEX IS A LOT OF THINGS THAT THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DO. AND NOW WITH MENTAL HEALTH WOULD ALMOST BET THERE'S AND YOU JUST ON ADDING THE THINGS THAT OFFICERS HAVE TO HAVE A WIDE RANGE. OF UNDERSTANDING AND. AND ALSO COMPASSION FOR. MAKE A CHIEF NEW IF I CAN JUSTIFY UP IS IT OPINION THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE REFER WITH WITHIN THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING. DOES THERE NEED TO BE MORE QUALITY OF TRAINING. I DO THINK THAT ANYTIME WE CAN DO MORE- STIMULATION TYPE TRAINING THEN THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THE S. B. T. THIRTY- YEAH SO YOU'RE NOT ONLY DEALING WITH THE ESCALATION. ISSUES BUT YOU'RE ALSO DEALING WITH. THAT KIND OF A MORE OF A REAL. TIME REAL EFFECT AND THEN THE SCENARIO BASED TYPE TRAINING- I THINK THOSE ARE- THOSE ARE GREAT BECAUSE I MEAN. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO SEE ABOUT THE APPLICATION OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING- VERSUS WHAT THEY KNOW IN THEIR HEAD BECAUSE THAT THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT REQUIRE. A CERTAIN AND THAT'S WHAT ABOUT THAT MOST ACCOUNTS THAT THEY HAVE TO USE THAT EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE. FIFTY ESCALATE RIGHT SO I THINK THAT IF THE IF AND I THINK THE CURRENT PRIORITIZE NATION. OF THAT TRAINING INTERCHANGING LEGISLATION. THEM THROUGH I NEED FIFTEEN. REQUESTED FROM YOU HAVE. THE CHIEFS AND SHERIFFS TV. THROUGH POST- WHETHER A COMPANY BE A- I CALLED LEVEL EDUCATED PERSON I'VE DON'T KNOW. BELIEVE SO CERTAINLY- CRITICAL THANK YOU TO HELP YOU KNOW HAVING A DAUGHTER IN COLLEGE. STILL WAITING FOR HER TO MAKE THEIR CALLS. BECAUSE THE CRITICAL THING I MEAN THE BUDGET BUT- I DON'T SEE YOU KNOW I DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW EFFECTS WHAT'S BEINGPROVIDED BUT- BUT I CAN CERTAINLY BUT I CAN CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND. THE NEED FOR. MORE EDUCATION AND THEN HELP THE BETTER FRAME PROBLEMS. THE MORE EDUCATION YOU HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALSO MAY ONE OF YOUR TO WE STILL HAVE THAT. 2% STILL AWAITING SO ANYONE HAS. FOR I TO RELEASE THOSE INDIVIDUALS SO THEY CAN GO OKAY MISS. RB K. HAS QESTIONS FOR OUR PREVIOUS- SPEAKERS SO NEXT UP WE HAVE MR GABRIEL WE HAVE MISTER MCCARTY AND WE ALSO HAVE R. B. K. AFTER THAT. YES YES. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I'VE CLEARLY ON THE SAME WAY THAT WAVE LIKE TODAY'S MY COLLEAGUE FROM PALM SPRINGS I HAD. VERY MUCH THE SAME QUESTIONS- I FOUND MR ALI KHAN'S COMMENTS ABOUT EDUCATION AND TRAINING TO BE EXTREMELY THOUGHT PROVOKING AND- CHIEF WAS GOING TO ASK YOU THE SAME THE SAME QUESTIONS THAT MY COLLEAGUE DID SO I APPRECIATE YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THIS- WOULD ACTUALLY IF WE CAN. LIKE TO GET MISTER ALI KHAN'S PERSPECTIVE ON THIS- ON ON EDUCATION AND TRAINING- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY THINKING ABOUT THE DIVERSITY OF SITUATIONS THAT WE PUT OUR OFFICERS IN THE- THE THIS THAT THE CHALLENGES THAT WE ASK THEM TO RESPOND TO- THE BURDENS THAT WE PUT ON THEM- AND THEN THINKING ABOUT MY OWN TRAINING AS AS AN ATTORNEY WHAT I HAD TO GO THROUGH BOTH EDUCATIONALLY AND WITH THE BAR EXAM AND HOW- CHALLENGING IT WAS AT THE BEGINNING BEING A YOUNG LAWYER IN TRYING TO. DEAL WITH THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT YOU DEAL WITH- YOU KNOW WHEN YOUR FIRST COUPLE YEARS OF LAW PRACTICE- SOME OF WHICH YOU LEARN IN LAW SCHOOL MANY OF WHICH YOU DON'T AND THEN THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH MORE CHALLENGING IT IS TO BE AN OFFICER IN THE FIELD AND WHAT THEY HAVE TO RESPOND TO SO. I'M JUST JUST CURIOUS YOU KNOW TO GET YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THESE ISSUES DO YOU THINK WE NEED. STRONGER EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS TO BECOME AN OFFICER DO YOU THINK THAT THERE ARE NO CHANGES WE SHOULD MAKE TO THE TRAINING AND EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS AND THEN GIVING YOUR VANTAGE POINT HAVING WORKED WITH. A LOT OF AGENCIES ACROSS ACROSS THE COUNTRY BOTH AT THE FEDERAL THE STATE LEVEL OR THEIR AGENCIES THAT DO TRAINING. REALLY WELL AND MODELS THAT WE CAN LOOK TO HEAR IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO JUST WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTS AND- AND ALSO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. TO THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES APPRECIATED VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SO MANY MEMBER- TO ANSWER QUESTIONED. TO THE- THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL UP EDUCATIONAL STANDARDS I DO BELIEVE THAT WOULD BE INCREDIBLY HELPFUL TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. WHAT YOU SEE IN CALIFORNIA AND ELSEWHERE IS THE MANY DEPARTMENTS WILL. CREATE INCENTIVES TO HAVE. OFFICERS WITH HIGHER EDUCATION BEFORE THEY JOINED THE ACADEMY. THEY'LL PROVIDE. ADDITIONAL STEPS IN IN SALARY. AND ALSO SOME DEPARTMENTS WILL HAVE- EDUCATIONAL. REQUIREMENTS FOR PROMOTION- AN ASSOCIATE'S DEGREE OR AT LEAST SOME CREDITS- SOMETIMES EVEN A MASTER'S DEGREE- DEPENDING ON THE AGENCY. I THINK THE CHALLENGES THOUGH. THOSE REQUIREMENTS ARE INCUMBENT UPON THE INDIVIDUAL AGENCY TO DO IT. IT'S NOT A STANDARD IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S UNIFORM THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AND I THINK THAT'S DIFFICULT BECAUSE WE EXPECT. ALL OFFICERS TO ACT. WITH THE SAME STANDARDS OF CARE. THE SAME STANDARDS IN USING FORCE AND THAT DECISION MAKING CAPABILITY. I ALSO BELIEVE AS I THINK I MENTIONED AYE COMMENTS THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TRAINING. AND EDUCATION. TRAINING IS ABOUT SKILLS TEACHING OFFICER HOW TO DRAW OTHER WEAPON AND FIRE IT ACCURATELY. TEACHING OFFICERS HOW TO GET IT IN HIGH PRECISION DRIVING. THINGS THAT I ACTUALLY LEARNED IN THE LAPD RESERVE ACADEMY AND I WAS ASTONISHED AT HOW WELL. I WAS ABLE TO DO IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME BECAUSE OF THE QUALITY OF THE INSTRUCTION. OF THOSE SKILLS. BUT CRITICAL THINKING AND DECISION MAKING. IS MUCH MORE COMPLICATED ESPECIALLY DEALING WITH THE COMPLEX CITIES. OF DEALING WITH. COMPLEX SOCIAL BEHAVIOR. DEALING WITH CRIME. DEALING WITH SOMEBODY WHO'S GOING THROUGH MENTAL HEALTH CRISES. AND WE WOULDN'T EXPECT. A LAWYER. WHO HAD NEVER GONE TO LAW SCHOOL OR STUDY THOSE THINGS TO ALL OF A SUDDEN GO. AND BE AN ADVOCATE FOR SOMEBODY. OFF ON MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES BUT YET WE EXPECT POLICE OFFICERS TO DO THAT. AND I JUST THINK IT PUTS THEM IN SUCH A DIFFICULT POSITION. TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH ALL OF THESE ISSUES. IN LITERALLY LIFE AND DEATH CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE. WE DON'T EVEN HAVE AS A STANDARD AND ENGAGE THEM TO TEACH THAT CRITICAL THINKING SKILL. AND ONE OTHER ASPECT OF IT AS WELL. MUCH OF THIS IS NOT THE FAULT OF THE DEPARTMENTS POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND POLICE ACADEMIES ARE TYPICALLY- THE INSTRUCTORS ARE POLICE OFFICERS OR FORMER POLICE OFFICERS WHICH WE WANT IN MANY OF THE SKILLS BASED ISSUES. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO TEACHING PEOPLE HOW TO CRITICALLY THINK- USING CRITICAL ANALYSIS AND EXERCISING GOOD JUDGMENT YOU REALLY DO WANT TO HAVE PROFESSIONAL EDUCATORS PEOPLE COME FROM DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES. DIFFERENT TALENTS TO TEACH THOSE SKILLS AND OFTEN TIMES THAT'S NOT WITHIN THE RESOURCES OF A POLICE DEPARTMENT OR POLICE ACADEMY AND THEY OFTEN HAVE TO USE OTHER POLICE OFFICERS TO TEACH THOSE VERY DIFFICULT SUBJECTS. AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING ALSO STRUCTURALLY THAT THE STATE SHOULD LOOK AT TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT I JUST- JUST IF I MAY MISTER TERRA COMMENT ON WHICH I THINK ARE CALLING FROM PALM SPRINGS ALSO MENTION ONE THAT YOU BRING UP WHICH IS WHICH IS THE QUESTION OF RESOURCES IT WAS VERY AYE AYE OPENING FOR ME- TWO YEARS AGO I HAD A BILL. ON THE ISSUE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINING FOR GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS AND JUST GETTING INTO THE WEEDS WITH POST AND SEEING HOW THAT THE COST ESTIMATES FOR TRAINING. ON HOW EXPENSIVE IT CAN BE TO TRAIN LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE IN THIS ONE PERSON AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW WE ALTERNATELY HOW TO SCALE THAT BILL BACK BECAUSE OF COST AND SO. I JUST WANT TO BE MINDFUL OF THE FACT THAT WE YOU KNOW WE HAVE REALLY HIGH EXPECTATIONS OF OUR OFFICERS AND YET SOMETIMES IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WORK. YOU KNOW I'M GOING TO MAKE IT THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE NEED TO PROVIDE THEM WITH THE TRAINING THAT THEY THAT THEY NEED FOR THE DIFFICULT ON TALENT IS THAT THEY ENCOUNTER SO I THINK THAT. AS WE LOOK AT THIS TOPIC OF POLICE REFORM I THINK WE NEED TO IT TO BE WILLING TO PUT OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS- AND BE WILLING TO INVEST IN IN PROVIDING- OFFICERS WITH WITH THE TRAINING AND THE EDUCATION THAT I THINK YOU'VE SUGGESTED TO US COULD MAKE A REALLY BIG DIFFERENCE HERE SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR THIS. COMMITTEE TO KEEP IN MIND OBVIOUSLY WE FACE EXTRAORDINARY BUDGET CHALLENGES BUT BUT THIS IS THESE ARE CRITICAL ISSUES LIFE AND DEATH ISSUES THAT YOU MENTIONED AND SO I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT THING THAT WE OUGHT TO. KEEP IN THE BACK OF OUR MINDS AS WE HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS. SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT IT WILL HAVE MISTER MCCARTY- WE ALSO INTRODUCTION SO YOU CAN. INTRODUCE HIMSELF AS WELL AS WELL THANK YOU. FOR THAT KIND INTRODUCTION SO. I THINK I'M- GOOD WITH THAT- I WANT TO ASK EITHER- THE CHIEF OR PROFESSOR ALL THE CON. ABOUT THE EDUCATION ISSUE I KNOW THAT. MR GABRIEL AND- SO MEMORY MAYES MENTION THIS ALREADY. YOU KNOW. WE HAD A TRAGEDY LAST YEAR WEREN'T YOUNG OFFICER TARA SOLOMON. WAS GUNNED DOWN HERE IN SACRAMENTO. TWO TWENTY SIX YEARS OLD AND AT HER FUNERAL. AND TO PRAY THE UNIVERSITY AND THE POLICE CHIEF TALKED ABOUT HOW SHE WAS WHEN SHE WAS IN THIS ACADEMY AT SAC STATE SHE DECIDED SHE WANTED TO MAJOR IN PSYCHOLOGY. AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE SHE SAID ALL LEARN ALL THIS TALK ABOUT BEING A POLICE OFFICER IN TACTICAL. IN THE ACADEMY AND I JUST THOUGHT WHAT A BRILLIANT YOUNG WOMAN OBVIOUSLY SHE WAS TRAGICALLY. GUNNED DOWN BUT I WONDER. IF THAT'S A QUESTION BECAUSE IF OFFICERS ARE DOING SO MUCH. WITH THE YOU KNOW PEOPLE AND JUST YOU KNOW HUMAN ISSUES ON HE COMMUNITY AND MENTAL AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES YOU KNOW MAYBE THE REQUIREMENT SHOULDN'T BE A CRIMINAL JUSTICE DEGREE IF THERE IS A REQUIREMENT. MAYBE IT SHOULD BE- PSYCHOLOGY OR HUMAN DEVELOPMENT OR CHILD DEVELOP OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO. HAS THAT EVER BEEN THOUGHT OF IF THERE EVER IS AN EDUCATION REQUIREMENT TO HAVE NOT NECESSARILY CRIMINAL JUSTICE BECAUSE YOU'LL LEARN THAT IN THE ACADEMY MAYBE NOT AS MANY HOURS AS- AS SHOULD BE AND YOU LEARN THAT THROUGH THE SCOPE OF. YOUR EMPLOYMENT BUT YOU KNOW SHOULD WE LOOK AT OTHER ASPECTS OF WHAT. YOU KNOW. PEOPLE DEAL WITH IN REAL LIFE IN THE COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. THAT'S QUESTION. ONE THE QUESTIONS FOR MR OR IS THAT A QUESTION EITHER ME OR SOME MORE- OKAY SIR WHO TALKED ABOUT EDUCATION EITHER ONE CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION HOW MY NEXT THREE QUESTIONS WILL BE FOR THE CHIEF. YEAH OKAY SO LET ME LET ME TAKE A SHOT AT IT BEFORE THE CHIEF DOES I BELIEVE THAT HAVING A DIVERSE EDUCATIONAL WORK FOR A WORKFORCE WITH DIVERSE EDUCATION WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL- I DO THINK THERE SHOULD BE SOME REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY HAVE IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING THE LAW IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM BUT HAVING THAT DIVERSITY OF PSYCHOLOGY AND OTHER OTHER- EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUNDS WOULD DEFINITELY BE USEFUL BECAUSE POLICING AS AS AS AN INDIVIDUAL AND AS AN INSTITUTION IS ABOUT TRYING TO SOLVE. PROBLEMS IN HAVING THAT DIVERSITY OF BACKGROUNDS I THINK IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. JUST AS DIVERSITY OF ETHNICITY CULTURE BACK IT'S AND THERE IS- THERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FBI WHICH OF COURSE IS VERY DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF THEM BEING A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY THEY'RE NOT RESPONDING TO NINE ONE ONE CALLS OR THESE CRISIS SITUATIONS BUT THEY CERTAINLY ARE A GOOD EXAMPLE OF ON THEIR INVESTIGATIVE COULD BE CAPABILITIES IN DEALING WITH COMPLEX ISSUES AND THEY VERY MUCH EMPHASIZE NOT JUST HAVING A COLLEGE EDUCATION BUT ALSO A GRADUATE DEGREE OR OTHER PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE. AND THEY DELIBERATELY RECRUIT FROM A BROAD ARRAY OF DISCIPLINES FROM MEDICINE TO LAWYERS TO ACCOUNTANTS TO- PSYCHOLOGY AND I THINK THAT WOULD BENEFIT POLICE DEPARTMENTS IF THERE WERE TO EMPHASIZE THIS ISSUE OF CRITICAL THINKING CRITICAL AND DECISION MAKING AND EXERCISING JUDGMENT- IN THE ROLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WERE HAVE RB K. AT NOTHING IF I GET. HOMES ARE MORE QUESTIONS YES AND I'M NOT SURE TO THE CHIEF WANTED TO ADD UPON THAT AS WELL. I THE ONLY THING I. I DO THINK THAT THE PRESIDENT SPEAKING ABOUT I THINK THAT SOMETIMES AS WELL BACKGROUND. ON THE- I GET THE MORE VERSATILE OR DIVERSIFIED THAT SOMEONE CAN BE IN THEIR- THEIR EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND SOMETIMES- BRINGS FORTH THE ABILITY TO LIKE I SAID BEFORE. TO WELL TO CRITICALLY EVALUATE THE SITUATION BUT TO ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO THE FRAME PROBLEMS. IN A DIFFERENT WAY THAT MAYBE SOMEBODY THAT ONLY HAD- YOU KNOW A PROFESSION SPECIFIC LIKE- CRIMINAL JUSTICE- MINISTRATION JUSTICE BACKGROUND. WHICH DEALS WITH THE WHOLE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND NOT NECESSARILY. WITH THE CALL FOR SERVICE THAT THAT HAND WITH THE HUMAN CONTACT THAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH. AT THAT MOMENT AND- SO SOME OF THOSE OTHER KIND OF- DEGREES- DO A PORT AND- PEOPLE THAT THE I GUESS THE GREATER EFFECTIVENESS. SOMETIMES. IN CERTAIN GIVEN SITUATIONS. OKAY THANK YOU AND I HEAR WHAT WHAT CITY ARE YOU FROM AGAIN. FROM THE CITY OF LOS ALL MEET WITH THE NORTH COUNTY OKAY THANK YOU SO I HAVE A FEW FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS FOR YOU FROM YOUR- POSITION AS THE CHIEF OF LOS ALAMEDA ST FROM YOUR POSITION WITH THE STATE ASSOCIATION SO. FROM ASSOCIATION OF COURSE WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF POLICE DEPARTMENT SO YOU DON'T KNOW ALL OF THEM WHAT'S HAPPENING BUT JUST WANT TO ASK OVERALL THE LAST I GUESS YEAR AND A HALF- SINCE WE'VE- HAD THE BILL INTO INTO A FACT AB THREE NINE TWO- THAT YOU KNOW THAT DEADLY FOR STANDARDS AND USE OF FORCE THAT WAS OF COURSE A- BIG LIFT THE LEGISLATURE MONUMENTAL- POSITION AT THE END THAT BECAME LAW. AND I THINK THE LAW WAS ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY BUT ALSO PREVENTION IN THE FIRST PLACE AND TRYING TO PREVENT INCIDENTS OF DEADLY FORCE AND LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS IT LOOKS LIKE IN THE LAST YEAR WE HAVE HAD FEWER. OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS IN CALIFORNIA BUT JUST WANTED IF YOU CAN- TALK ABOUT WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING AT POLICE DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE EVEN YOURS. IN TRAINING AND DE ESCALATION EFFORTS AND WHAT WE ARE DOING. TO PREVENT THESE IN THE FIRST PLACE. YEAH WE- I THINK YOU'RE CORRECT THAT THINK THE- OBVIOUSLY THE- THREE NINETY TWO- WAS A WAS A HEAVY LIFT FOR EVERYBODY. AND GETTING THAT ACROSS THE FINISH LINE IF YOU WILL BUT- YEAH BUT IT WAS- WELL CRAFTED AND- DID PROVIDE THE STRUCTURE. THAT THAT WE NEEDED TO HAVE FOR OUR STATE. AND I THINK THAT- AND DEFINING YOU KNOW USE OF FORCE IN DEFINING THE DEADLY. USES OF FORCE AND IT IT WAS. I WHAT ANYTIME YOU CREATE LEGISLATION LIKE THAT THAT KIND OF MAGNITUDE. IT CHANGES POLICY OBVIOUSLY AND IT ALSO CHANGES ALL WHICH HELPS TO CHANGE- PROBABLY CULTURE A LITTLE BIT. AT LEAST IN THE INSTRUCTIONAL PHASE OF YOU KNOW WHAT THESE POLICIES IN THE LEGISLATION. ARE IDENTIFYING AND I THINK. I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT- THE USE OF FORCE IN GENERAL LIKE- AS YOU INDICATED OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS THAT WE WERE IMPORTING TO THE- DOJ THAT YOU KNOW CREATING SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH- THAT THEY'VE ALL BEEN REDUCED AND I THINK THAT'S PART OF THAT IS. IS TO THAT TRAINING I THINK IF WE KEEP THIRTY EVEN THOUGH IT DOESN'T FULLY COME INTO EFFECT UNTIL- JANUARY- I THINK A LOT OF US HAVE ALREADY. DROPPED THE STATE A HAVE A HAVE CHANGE OUR POLICIES ON DE ESCALATION AND THEN ALL THE VERBIAGE AND ALL THE WORDING THAT SUPPOSED TO BE IN THERE- BY THAT DATE R. AS IN THERE I KNOW THAT'S- TRUE ABOUT MY POLICY. IN MY DEPARTMENT AND WE'VE ALREADY GIVEN THAT POLICY OUT WE'VE ALREADY HAD TRAINING ON THAT SO. THAT OUR OFFICERS ARE HIRING TRAINING ON THE POLICY ITSELF WE'RE GETTING SET UP HERE IN THE NEXT MONTH OR TWO I BELIEVE IN NOVEMBER WE'RE GOING TO BE. DOING THE FORMAL TRAINING WERE WAITING PROPOSED TO COME OUT WITH THE SIMULATORS TO HELP US WITH THAT TRAINING- BUT- WHAT ARE YOU KNOW I DO. THAT I THINK. I THINK WHAT IT DOES IS IT BRINGS EVERYTHING TO THE POOR. AND MAY CAUSE PEOPLE TO. NOT ONLY CHANGE LIKE I SAID THEIR POLICIES BUT CHANGED- YOU KNOW. THEIR CULTURE PERHAPS AND IN THE WAY THAT THEY VIEW pACTUALLY CARRY OUT THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES. OKAY THANK YOU THAT THAT'S CERTAINLY THE HOPE AND YOU KNOW WHY I FIRST THAT MEASURE OUT WE ALL ADOPTED TWO YEARS AGO. I WENT TO- JEFF NOW ON INCIDENTS WHERE THERE IS. A DEADLY FORCE AND WHERE THERE IS AN INVESTIGATION. IT'S EXTREMELY COMPLICATED AND YOU KNOW. THE PERCEIVED WHETHER OR NOT IT'S A LEGAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST THE APPS ABSOLUTE. PERCEIVED CONFLICT WHEN- POLICE ESSENTIALLY POLICE THEMSELVES AND DO THE INVESTIGATIONS A LARGE PART OF WHY I DID THE BILL LISTS PAST YEAR THE GOVERNOR SIGNED ON THE PEN DESTINATIONS. BUT THERE'S ANOTHER ISSUE THAT CAME UP TALKING TO SOME POLICE CHIEFS AND I WANTED TO ASK IF YOU COULD TALK ABOUT IT- ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO THERE WAS AN OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTING IN MY DISTRICT IN WEST SACRAMENTO. ACTUALLY WON THE FIRST TWO INNINGS AND WESTPAC IN TWENTY YEARS. AND YOU KNOW BY ALL ACCOUNTS THE IT WAS A- KIND OF A SUICIDE BY COP THE OFFICERS- YOU KNOW. WE'RE DOING THEIR JOB AND HAD TO RESPOND ACCORDINGLY AND THE INVESTIGATION THAT STARTED THE VERY NEXT DAY. I READ AND I AND I HEARD ABOUT I JUST THOUGHT WELL THIS PROBABLY SHOULD BE BUT ALL POLICE DEPARTMENTS DO. THEY HAD AN ADJACENT CITY THE CITY OF DAVIS BEING THE LEAD INVESTIGATOR OR FOR THAT OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTING WHEN THERE'S A FATALITY- BECAUSE THERE IS THIS. CONFLICT AND WHETHER IT'S REAL AGAIN IT'S THIS PERCEPTION THE COMMUNITY WHERE YOU KNOW THE PERSON YOU'RE WORKING WITH IS INVESTIGATING YOUR BODY AND IF SOMEONE YOU WORKED WITH AND JUST HOW HOW DO YOU HAVE THAT. INDEPENDENCE AND TRANSPARENCY. AND KIND OF A DISTANCE AND WHILE THE ADJACENT AGENCY MAYBE THERE HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE THERE'S A LITTLE SEPARATION DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT. SO I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE FEW CITIES. ACROSS CALIFORNIA HAVE THESE- POLICIES SO MY QUESTION SHE DO. YOU THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA I SHOULD ALL POLICE TO. HAVE THESE DEMO. WERE YOU HAVE YOU KNOW THE CITY OF. SAN DIEGO HAVING WITH THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO OR- LA AND- THE COUNTY THE SHERIFF FOR LONG BEACH UNLESS ALAMEDA US. HAVEN'T HAVE AN ARRANGEMENT WE HAVE AN ADJACENT CITY. BE THE LEAD ON AN OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTING WHETHER IS A FATALE DAY. YEAH SEVEN I'M I'M ACTUALLY KIND OF BIASED ON THIS SITUATION ONLY BECAUSE IN ORANGE COUNTY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE CITY OF HUNTINGTON BEACH- ALL OF OUR OFFICER OF ALL SHOOTINGS ARE INVESTIGATED BY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND THERE'S SPECIALIZED UNIT- ABOUT CIVIL SHOOTING UNIT THAT- THEY CALL THAT THE ROLLOUT TEAM TO COME OUT. TO THAT AND IF YOU AND I THINK ONE- THE- DOJ AT- CAL DOJA DONE- LOOK AT ALL OF THE SHOOTING THAT HAPPENED IN CALIFORNIA WHOSE LARGEST TOP TEN PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T YOU KNOW LIVED AT THE GATE HEARINGS I THINK LORD COUNTY VA WAS NUMBER ONE ONLY BECAUSE THEY INVESTIGATE ALL THE CITIES WITHIN ORANGE COUNTY. I NEED TO BE TO ACTUALLY USE THAT THE SHERIFF'S BUT THE TERRORISTS WERE INVOLVED IN THE IN THAT SITUATION THEY USE THE DA'S OFFICE SO- I'M NOT SURE WHY THEY DON'T USE THE DA'S OFFICE BUT- I DO THINK THAT THERE IS- BECAUSE THE IT. I DO THINK THAT ONE IS IT CREATES A SEPARATION AND ALLOWS FOR- YOU KNOW THAT LIKE YOU SAID EVEN IF YOUR NEIGHBORING AGENCY THERE'S ALWAYS GONNA BE A LITTLE BIT SOMEBODY THINKING THAT YOU KNOW THAT IT NEW OR WHAT THAT IS- IMPARTIAL AS THEY CAN BE BUT- AND THAT'S ALWAYS A CONCERN EVEN WITH THE AID THEY CONCERNED THE KIDS ARE PROSECUTING THE THEY WANT TO PROSECUTE COPS I THINK THEY WANT TO PROSECUTE PEOPLE THAT COMMIT YOU KNOW CRIMES. AND ANAHIT COPIES COMMITTEE CRIME THEY WILL FALL THROUGH THE PROSECUTION BUT- SO AND I AM AWARE OF THE NUMBER OF- I CAN'T THINK OF MY POP MY HEAD BUT I KNOW THAT THERE ARE AGENCIES THAT ARE NOW CREATING THESE REVITALIZED UNITS WHERE THEY'RE USING OFFICERS ON THEM LIKE WITH A GROUP OF POLICE DEPARTMENTS- TO DO A KIND OF A ROLLOUT TEAM IF YOU WILL TO INVESTIGATE OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS. AND IN THAT THE- IT IF IT'S THEIR AGENCY THAT'S INVOLVED THEN THEY THEN OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE ACCUSED THEIR. INVESTIGATORS FROM BEING PART OF THAT THERE UNITS I THINK IT IS I THINK IT IS. THAT YOU KNOW I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE LAW YOU CAN AS THEY YOU MENTIONED HAVE YOU GOING UNIONIST KERR. DEPARTMENT BECAUSE I KNOW THE THEY HAVE TO LARGE THE PARK DEALING HAVE CAN'T. FEET WORKING AT POSSIBLE THE THAT THAT BY FOR K. OF THE UNIT. THERE NOT MIXED IN WITH A WHOLE LOT OF THE- YOU KNOW THE GENERAL. IF YOU WILL THE FOLKS ARE WORKING OF LONG. SO BUT- BUT I KNOW FOR A LOT OF THE OTHER AGENT IS YEAH YOU YEAH I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA AND- AND I THINK THE- THE IDEA OF YOU KNOW I'M GETTING YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY CAL CHIEFS WANTED. TO HAVE THE- OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL INVESTIGATE- THOSE THOSE KINDS OF CASES THAT ARE REQUEST AND NOW IT'S YOU KNOW MANDATORY FOR THEM TO DO- BUT- YOU KNOW SO BUT THAT WAS IT WAS FOR THE PROBABLY THE SAME PURPOSES THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING NOW. SHARE THAT JUST JUST TO CLARIFY IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THAT THE THAT THE SECOND PART WITH THE AG COMES IN BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN BUT- THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR IDA THEY HAVE TO RECEIVE THE INITIAL WORK FROM A POLICE DEPARTMENT. AND THOSE FIRST STEPS AND SO. THE MORE TRANSPARENCY INDEPENDENCE THE BETTER LIKE. THE EXAMPLE RECENTLY IN VALLEJO WHERE THEY HAD THAT. SHOOTING WHEN THEY OFFICERS SHOT FROM THE BACK OF THE PICKUP TRUCK WITH THEIR- YOU KNOW THE THOUGHT POLICE ISSUED ASSAULT RIFLE AND SHOT THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD AND VERY QUESTIONABLE IN THE COMMUTING VALLEJO. AND THEN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT YOU KNOW DESTROYED THE WINDSHIELD AND SO YOU KNOW THERE'S- SO HAVING AN OUTSIDE. POLICE DEPARTMENT- YOU KNOW BE THE LEAD CERTAINLY ALLOWS WHETHER IT'S THAT SOLANO COUNTY DA OR IF THEY HAD IT UP TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. JUST TO HAVE- YOU KNOW. MORE MORE CLARITY IN MORE TRANSPARENT. INVESTING THAT THEY HAVE TO TAKEOVERS. I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS THERE AND I WOULD HOPE THAT THE- WHAT CITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA WOULD DO ON THEIR OWN IF THE IF NOT THE STATE YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY SHOULD LOOK INTO THAT. HONEST ABOUT THIS MCCARTY YEP I'M SORRY. WE WILL. THIS IS A LONG DISCUSS AND IT WE WANT TO WE HAVE ONE MORE PERSON Q. WE HAVE R. B. K. THIS HEARINGS POST AND AT TWELVE NOON WE STILL HAVE PRESENTERS ARE STILL WAITING TO PRESENT. AND SO I WOULD ASK MEMBERS IF YOU CAN JUST- PATEL'S. HOLD YOUR QUESTIONS UNTIL AFTER ALL THE PRESENTERS HAS HAVE ACTUALLY HAD OPPORTUNITY PRESENT WE'RE GOING TO EXTEND THE TIME TO ONE O'CLOCK. AS WELL ALL MEMBERS TO BE MINDFUL OF THAT BECAUSE WE ARE JUST ON THE FIRST- PRESENTS PRESENTERS AND SO WE WANT TO BE MINDFUL OF THE ONES ARE WAITING SO. YOU HAVE A FINAL THOUGHT BEFORE WE MOVE ON YEAH I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE LOOK AT REFORM IN LARGE. DEFEATS THAT'S MISSING IS THE CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT WE HAVE THE- THAT ADVOCATES WANT REFORMS WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND. YOU KNOW WHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT THINKS ABOUT HOW YOU CAN DO THESE THINGS AND SO POINT TO GET ANSWERS SO FAR MY LAST ONE CHEAP. I KNOW WE'RE NOT MAKING LOSS TODAY BUT DURING YOUR- DURING YOUR PRESENTATION YOU MENTION ON THE DECERTIFICATION PIECE THAT. YOU THINK IT'S GOOD TO HAVE THAT IN CALIFORNIA. YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS YOU DON'T WANT TO- YOU KNOW SIDE STEP- WHAT WE'VE ALREADY PUT INTO LAW SO CAN YOU JUST BRIEFLY TALK ABOUT WHAT WHAT WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT SO WHAT TYPE AT. A DECERTIFICATION PROCESS SHOULD CALIFORNIA HAVE THAT WOULD BE RESPECTFUL OF YOU SAID- EXISTING CHANGES TO LAW AND THAT'S. MY FINAL QUESTION. YEAH I'LL BE BRIEF ON THE ONLY BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE- COLLABORATING WITH THE- SOME OF THE- LEGISLATOR AND THEN SOME OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT- GROUP'S. LEADERSHIPGROUPS ON ON WHAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE AND THEN THEN WHAT I MEANT BY THAT THERE IS. YOU KNOW WE HAVE KHOBAR THE PEACE OFFICER BILL OF RIGHTS AND WE HAVE A NUMBER OF. YOU KNOW OTHER ISSUES THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE AND IT'S ALL OF YOU. ARE WHERE IS IT THE CONCEPT OF THE CERTIFICATION. IS THE RIGHT CONCEPT FOR CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION IT'S THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS ON HOW THAT ACTUALLY OCCURS IN WHO GETS T THE OVERSIGHT. AND GETS THAN WHAT THAT WHAT LEVEL OF YOU KNOW MISCONDUCT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT. AND SO ALL OF THOSE ISSUES THEY HAVE TO BE KIND OF. A HAMMERED OUT AND FIGURED OUT THE AND- AND TO PROTECT YOU KNOW PROTECT THE OFFICERS PROTECT ORGANIZATIONS UNSERVED AND ELEGANT OF POLICE AGENCIES. AS WELL AS THE COMMUNITY AND SO- IN OUR BIGGEST THING IS MAKING SURE THAT THAT THAT THE THERE IS YOU KNOW THE RETENTION OF BAD POLICE OFFICERS DID NOT OCCUR NOR DO THEY GET PASSED. ON. TO ANOTHER AGENCY AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO PREVENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OF OUR B. K. EUROPE BAT THANK YOU MR ST. SO I WANTED TO REVISIT THAT THAT TOPIC THAT MR MAYES SR GABRIEL REYES AROUND EDUCATION. I HAD THE PRIVILEGE IN MY CAPACITY AS A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE OF GOING TO NORWAY AND SEEING. THE TRAINING THEY DO FOR THEIR OFFICERS THAT ARE IN PRISONS AND- IT WAS A FASCINATING FASCINATING DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT WE DO HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. AND THOSE INDIVIDUALS COME INTO THIS ACADEMY THEY GET TWO YEARS OF EDUCATION. AND THE EQUIVALENT OF AN ASSOCIATES DEGREE BEFORE THEY GO INTO THE PRISONS AND DO THEIR JOB DURING THAT TIME THEY ARE TAUGHT PSYCHOLOGY SOCIOLOGY CRIMINOLOGY. AND THEY COME OUT WITH A DEPTH OF KNOWLEDGE THAT.% PALES IN COMPARISON TO WHAT WE'RE PROVIDING HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND I APPRECIATE THE SUGGESTION THAT WE PUT INTO PLACE A COLLEGE REQUIREMENT I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW THAT THE CRITICAL THINKING THAT WAS MENTIONED BY BOTH DR HANNEKE AND MISTER ALI KHAN. ABOUT THE DISCRETION THAT IS GIVING IN AND THE WORK THAT GOES INTO MAKING THOSE CHOICES AND- PROBLEM SOLVING CRITICAL THINKING IS SO IMPORTANT AT SUCH A GOOD TOPIC BUT- WE ALSO NEED TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT THE DEBT. THAT ARE COLLEGE STUDENTS GRADUATE WITH THESE DAYS AND THEN WHAT WE ARE ASKING FROM THEM. IS A LOT. WHEN I WOULD URGE US AS LEGISLATORS TO THINK CREATIVELY I KNOW WE ALL. JUST DID FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN CUTS WE ARE IN THE GREATEST RECESSION IN MY LIFETIME. BUT WE HAVE AN INCREDIBLE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM IN THIS STATE IT IS TEACHING MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE DISCUSSING HERE TODAY. AND SO ARE THERE WAYS IN OUR CURRENT SYSTEM TO PROVIDE THIS EDUCATION. TO THOSE GOING INTO LAW ENFORCEMENT AT NO COST TO THEM WITH A DEGREE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT. RATHER THAN PUTTING ON THEM ADDITIONAL COLLEGE DEBT AND THE THINGS THAT WE KNOW ARE SO BURDENSOME AND SO I THINK THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE. WHERE THE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES I THINK WE CAN BE CREATIVE AND PROBLEM SOLVING. BUT WITH THAT I DO HAVE A QUESTION AND I'M FOR MR ALL THE CON WHICH IS GIVEN MY EXPERIENCE AND- AND- WHAT I GOT TO SEE IN OUR WAY AND REALLY THE VALUE OF THAT EDUCATION I'M CURIOUS IF. YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT IN RESPONSE TO MR GABRIEL'S QUESTIONS ABOUT CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA'S DOING. BUT I THINK WHEN WE LOOK BROADER THERE ARE SOLUTIONS OUT THERE THAT WE CAN- LOOK TO AND BE BETTER FROM AND I. SO I JUST ASK OUR THEIR SYSTEM THROUGHOUT THE WORLD THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES THE YOU WOULD ADVISE US TO MIRROR. AND TO BETTER EMULATE. REMEMBER I THINK JUST ACTUALLY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU TOUCHED UPON ABOUT OTHER SYSTEMS ARE ACCESS AND OF COURSE THIS THE TO EDUCATION AND THE SOCIAL EQUITY ISSUES IN THE DEBT. IS AN IMPORTANT QUESTION IT ON IN THIS IN THIS ARE. ON THIS ISSUE BUT I DO THINK THERE'S ONE IN THE UNITED STATES ONE MODEL THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER LOOKING AT AND I'M VERY HESITANT TO DRAW ANY ANALOGIES TO THE MILITARY BUT I DO THINK. FOR MY EXPERIENCE HAVING BEEN. A PROFESSOR AT A MILITARY COLLEGE. THE EMPHASIS THE U. S. MILITARY'S PUT ON EDUCATION IN DEVELOPING NOT ONLY ITS FRONTLINE SOLDIERS BUT ALSO WITH LEADERSHIP IS TRULY IMPRESSIVE. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE STRUCTURES THAT THEY HAVE HAD SINCE WORLD WAR TWO WITH THE GI BILL AND MANY OTHER PROGRAMS TO ENCOURAGE OFF. TO ENCOURAGE SOLDIERS AND AIRMEN AND SAILORS TO GET THEIR EDUCATION WELL- WHEN THEY START IN THE MILITARY AT A VERY YOUNG AGE WHICH IS SIMILAR TO POLICING WHERE MOST POLICE OFFICERS DO START AT THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE. THAT THERE ARE MODELS THAT COULD BE PUT IN PLACE WHERE OFFICERS COULD HAVE A GI BILL OF SOME SORT OR- EVEN IF YOU LOOK AT HE PROFESSIONAL LEVEL SOME MILITARY DOCTORS AND LAWYERS WHO BECOME JAGS. OFTEN TIME THE MILITARY WILL HELP PAY FOR THEIR EDUCATION AND THEN THEY HAVE A COMMITMENT OF SERVICE AFTER THAT SO EXCUSE ME OUT SO I DO THINK THERE ARE MODELS EVEN IN THE UNITED STATES THAT SHOULD BE EXAMINED. THAT MAY BE ANALOGOUS TO RELEASE CERTAIN ELEMENTS WOULD HELP ADDRESS THIS ISSUE THAT IT SEEMS THAT EVERYBODY IS COGNISANT OF. THANK YOU I THINK THAT'S HELPFUL AND YOU KNOW AGAIN I JUST HOPE THAT WE REALLY LOOK AT. WHAT RESOURCES WE HAVE HERE POINT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES AND HER CALIFORNIA TO BETTER PREPARE OUR POLICE OFFICERS ON THE STREET BECAUSE I HAVE TO SAY MISTER MAYES POINT ABOUT- THE FACT THAT THE PERSON WHO CUTS MY HAIR HAS MORE HOURS I THINK THERE'S LESS RISK IN A BAD HAIR CUT SO WE- WE NEED TO DO SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT WE'RE GOING TO MOVE SWIFTLY- NOW WE WANT TO HEAR FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE. OF SOMEONE WHO'S FROM THE LEGAL PROFESSION. EACH PANELIST WE HAVE TO UP TO TWELVE MINUTES AND SPEAKING. AND ALSO PRESENTING- THE NEXT PERSON WHAT HAPPENS MISTER RYAN HARRIS WOULD YOU PLEASE. APPROACH AND TAKE A SEAT. PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELF AND BEGIN WITH YOUR PRESENTATION. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS GERMAN GIPSON AFTERNOON. I'M THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK TODAY ON THE SUBJECT OF POLICE REFORM I REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF BLACK LAWYERS AS A NORTHERN CALIFORNIA GENERAL COUNSEL AND CO CHAIR OF HIS LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE. IN ADDITION TO BEING AN ATTORNEY I AM ALSO A FORMER LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. AND HOLD A MASTER'S DEGREE IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE. CABLES MEMBERSHIP INCLUDES OVER SIX THOUSAND AFRICAN AMERICAN ATTORNEYS JUDGES LAW PROFESSORS AND LAW STUDENTS. ITS MISSION IS TO PROMOTE REFORM IN THE LAWS AND IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE AS WE CONTINUE THE QUEST FOR EQUALITY AND EMPOWERMENT. WE ARE COMMITTED TO ADVANCING JUSTICE AND EQUALITY THAT BEING SAID. OUR FOCUS ON THE MATTER OF POLICE REFORM. IS IN PROMOTING THE RULE OF LAW AND CONFIDENCE IN OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM. IF APPROPRIATE LEGISLATIVE INTERVENTION FOCUSES ON PROMOTING THE RULE OF LAW AND CONFIDENCE IN OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM WITH RESPECT TO POLICE REFORM. WE BELIEVE THE FUNCTIONAL IMPACT. WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE INCIDENCE OF POLICE BRUTALITY AND HOMICIDES IN THE LINE OF DUTY. LAW ENFORCEMENT REPRESENTS THE PRIMARY POINT OF CONTACT BETWEEN THE CITIZENRY AND GOVERNMENT. IT IS IMPORTANT AT THIS INTERSECTION REINFORCES THE PREMISE THAT GOVERNMENT EXISTS TO ENABLE OUR EXISTENCE. NOT CHALLENGES. LAW ENFORCEMENT IS ALSO INTEGRAL TO THE RULE OF LAW AND OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM WITHOUT APPROPRIATE GOVERNMENTAL USE OF FORCE THERE WOULD BE NO WAY TO EFFECTUATE JUSTIN'S. BUT WHAT WE HAVE SEEN ON TELEVISION WITH THESE POLICE KILLINGS INCIDENTS OF POLICE BRUTALITY AND STORIES OF POLICE CORRUPTION AND FLAGRANT RACISM. THESE ARE ISSUES THAT PROLIFERATE INJUSTICE ESPECIALLY WITHIN OUR MOST VULNERABLE AND DISENFRANCHISED COMMUNITIES. PEOPLE STOP BELIEVING IN OUR SYSTEM WHEN I THINK IT ISN'T DESIGNED FOR THEM WHEN THEY THINK THAT CALLING LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR ASSISTANCE WILL RESULT IN THE DEATH OF A LOVED ONE. IT IS THAT SUFFER THE MOST CHALLENGES NEED A LAW ENFORCEMENT PRESENCE THAT THEY BELIEVE WANTS THEM TO LIVE AND THRIVE. UNFORTUNATELY WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS QUITE THE OPPOSITE AND FOR THE LONGEST TIME COMMUTER. MOST IN NEED A POSITIVE GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION HAS SUFFERED AT THE HANDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT REPRESSION. THE COMMUNITY POLICE REFORM MOVEMENT OF THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES WITH PROMISING. IN THE EIGHTIES. WITH ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT PRACTITIONERS REALIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF ENGAGING WITH THE COMMUNITY STEPPING OUTSIDE PATROL CAR WORKING WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS PRACTICING PROBLEM ORIENTED POLICING AND ENGAGING IN PUBLIC OUTRAGE. BUT THIS WAS JUST A SMALL FIRST STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. IN ACTUALITY FOR TWO HUNDRED YEARS WE HAVE HAD THE PERFECT RECIPE FOR POLICING. IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINE SIR ROBERT PEEL CREATED THE FIRST PROFESSIONAL POLICE FORCE IN ENGLAND IN SO DOING AS A PREMISE FOR THE FUNCTION OF POLICING HE SAID POLICE ARE THE COMMUNITY AND THE COMMUNITY ARE POLICING. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE POLICE ARE FULL TIME. HE VIEWED POLICING AS AND THE COMMUNITY HAS ONE IN THE SAME AND IN ORDER TO ENSURE SAFETY IN THE COMMUNITY HE REALIZED. THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE COMMUNITY MUST BE ONE OF MUTUAL RESPECT PARTNERSHIP AND COLLABORATION. MISTER PILLS NINE POLICING PRINCIPLES SHOULD GUIDE OUR DISCUSSION ON POLICE REFORM. I HAVE SUBMITTED THEM INTO THE RECORD FOR YOUR REVIEW. AMONG THE MOST RELEVANT OF THE NINE POLICING PRINCIPLES IN MY OPINION OUR PRINCIPLES NUMBER FIVE AND NUMBER EIGHT PRINCIPLE NUMBER FIVE SAYS. LAW ENFORCEMENT MUST SEEK AND PRESERVE PUBLIC FAVOR NOT BY PANDERING TO PUBLIC OPINION BUT BY CONSTANTLY DEMONSTRATING ABSOLUTELY IMPARTIAL SERVICE TO LAW INCOMPLETE INDEPENDENCE A POLICY. WITHOUT REGARD TO THE JUSTICE OR INJUSTICE OF THE SUBSTANCE OF INDIVIDUAL LOSS BY READY OFFERING OF INDIVIDUAL SERVICE AND FRIENDSHIP TO ALL MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WITHOUT REGARD TO THEIR WEALTH OR SOCIAL STANDING. ALREADY EXERCISE OF COURTESY AND FRIENDLY GOOD HUMOR. AND BY READY OFFERING OF INDIVIDUAL SACRIFICE AND PROTECTING AND PRESERVING LIFE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER FIVE STAND FOR THE PROPOSITION THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT NEEDS TO LOVE THE COMMUNITY. ALL OF US IN THE COMMUNITY THAT'S THEIR MANDATE AS AGENTS OF GOVERNMENT UNDER THE SOCIAL CONTRACT. PRINCIPLE A PRINCIPLE NUMBER EIGHT SAYS LAW ENFORCEMENT MUST RECOGNIZE ALWAYS THE NEED FOR STRICT ADHERENCE TO POLICE EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS. AND TO REFRAIN FROM EVEN SEEMING TO USURP THE POWERS OF THE JUDICIARY IN A VENDING INDIVIDUALS OR THE STATE AND UP WITH THOR TATE OF THE JUDGING GUILT AND PUNISHING THE GUILTY. PRINCIPLE NUMBER EIGHT STANCE AGAINST POLICE BRUTALITY. POLICE BRUTALITY IS AT ITS CORE LAW ENFORCEMENT USURPING THE ROLE OF THE JUDICIARY AND EXACTING JUDICIAL PUNISHMENT. WHEN THE POLICE ARE VIEWED AS THE DELIVERS OF EXTRAJUDICIAL PUNISHMENT THE COMMUNITIES WHO SUFFER THE MOST FROM THE VIGILANTE ISM TEND NOT TO ASK HIM FOR HELP IN RESOLVING DISPUTES. THUS VIOLENT CRIME INCREASES. POLICE VIGILANTE ISM AND OUTRIGHT CRIMINALITY HAS REARED ITS UGLY HEAD IN COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE. TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WE SEE WHAT'S GOING ON IN VALLEJO WHERE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS HAVE BUILT A CULTURE AROUND KILLING CIVILIANS. IN ORDER TO FACILITATE UPWARD MOBILITY WITHIN THEIR AGENCY. COPS ARE LITERALLY THROWING PARTIES FOR EACH OTHER AFTER THEY KILL CIVILIANS AND THEN THEY MARK THEMSELVES WITH PRIDE BY SLIGHTLY BENDING THEIR BADGES TO SIGNIFY THE NEW SOCIAL STANDING AMONG THE RANKS. TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. WHERE SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES BRAND THEMSELVES WITH TATTOOS TO SIGNIFY THEIR CRIMINAL DISPOSITION. FOR YEARS AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTING TO ROOT OUT AND ELIMINATE GANG BEHAVIOR WITHIN THIS LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. THESE INCIDENTS DEMONSTRATE A FLAGRANT DISREGARD AND DIAMETRICAL OPPOSITION TO THE ROLE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS SHOULD PROVIDE WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY. YET THE CULTURE WITHIN THESE AGENCIES HAVE FESTERED FOR SO LONG. AND DRIVE WITH SO MUCH VITALITY THAT OFFICERS FELT IT WAS SAFE ENOUGH TO OPENLY COMMUNICATE SYMBOLICALLY OR OTHERWISE OF THEIR HATRED FOR THE PEOPLE THEY HAVE SWORN TO SERVE. I SAY ALL OF THAT TO SAY THIS. WE HAVE A CULTURAL PROBLEM IN POLICING AND IT NEEDS LEGISLATIVE INTERVENTION. MORE TRAINING WILL NOT SOLVE THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE THE MISCONDUCT THAT UNDERMINES CONFIDENCE IN THE RULE OF LAW THE MOST IS WILLFUL. THEREFORE CABLE RECOMMENCE LET US LEGISLATIVE SOLUTIONS DESIGNED TO FACILITATE ROOTING OUT CULTURAL CORRUPTION AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE ARE IN FAVOR OF MANDATING THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS STUDY AND LEARN THE TEACHINGS OF SIR ROBERT PEEL DURING THEIR CERTIFICATION TRAINING THEY NEED TO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE HERE FOR. WE'RE IN FAVOR OF ELIMINATING AND NARROWING QUALIFIED IMMUNITY FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. WE'RE IN FAVOR OF A BILL THAT ALLOWS FOR THE DECERTIFICATION OF MY OFFICE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND THE CREATION OF A STATEWIDE RADIALIS WE HAVE HEARD ALREADY TESTIMONY ABOUT HOW DIFFICULT IT IS. FOR OUR POLICE CHIEFS TO GET RID OF THE OFFICERS OF AND NOT DOING THE RIGHT THING. WE'RE IN FAVOR OF CREATING A STATEWIDE MANDATE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TO WEAR BODY CAMERAS. AND THAT THEY RECORD FOOTAGE AT ALL TIMES EXCEPT FOR WHEN PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS JUSTIFY OTHERWISE. IN ORDER TO FIND THE PROBLEM WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO TO DETECTED. AND WE'RE IN FAVOR OF CREATING A LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION. THAT CRIMINALIZES. POLICE OFFICER SPEECH THAN COURAGE'S VIOLATING THE RIGHTS. OF THE PUBLIC BY MEANS OF GOVERNMENTAL USE OF FORCE.NOW THIS IS A NEW IDEA. AND WE'RE WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU ON CRAFTING APPROPRIATE LEGISLATION FOR THIS. TO CLOSE. SIR ROBERT PEEL'S TEACHINGS HAVE BEEN ON THE BOOKS FOR TWO HUNDRED YEARS THEY CREATE A PERFECT FRAMEWORK FOR CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE SHOULD HAVE LAWS DESIGNED TO EFFECTUATE THESE PRINCIPLES. BUT FIRST WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THE CULTURAL PROBLEM AND POLICING. AND WE'RE READY TO WORK WITH YOU TO ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH RETIRES NEXT EVERYONE INVITES- GABBY TRAIL TO PLEASE COME AND- AIR SELF TO GIVE HER PRESENTATION AND THEN AFTER WHICH WILL ASK MEMBERS TO ASK. WE WANT TO DO THIS. FOR THE SAKE OF TIME SO. THESE PROVIDES OPENING CAN YOUR INTRODUCTION- WHEN YOU'RE READY. I THINK YOU NEED TO PUSH THAT BUTTON THERE WE GO CALL IT CAN HEAR ME YES I GOT A CALL I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF SACRAMENTO ACT A LOCAL NONPROFIT THAT IS AN AFFILIATE FOR PEOPLE CALIFORNIA- WE HAVE BEEN IN THIS COMMUNITY FOR THE LAST TWENTY NINE YEARS- AND SO PUBLIC SAFETY IS. SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING AND WORKING REALLY HARD AT A LOCAL LEVEL BUT ALSO AT THE STATE LEVEL AND- WHEN WE FIND OURSELVES TALKING ABOUT WE AT THE COMMUNITY- HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS ARE ON PUBLIC SAFETY- ONE OF THE CONCERNING AN ALARMING THINGS THAT- WE HAVE IDENTIFIED IS THAT. THESE THESE CONVERSATIONS ONLY HAPPEN. AFTER A LOVED ONE HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM OUR COMMUNITIES IN IN A BRUTAL WAY. I'M A MOTHER OF TWIN BOYS BROWN VOICE. RICE SO WHEN I THINK ABOUT POLICE REFORM. THERE IS THE NAME URGENCY TO ADDRESS THIS BECAUSE THERE ARE MOMS ACROSS OUR STATE WHO CANNOT HOLD THEIR LOVED ONES. RIGHT THERE IS PEOPLE THAT. ARE JUST IN SO MUCH PAIN WE ARE BLEEDING YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR FUTURE COULD HAVE BEEN AND WHAT THEY COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO OUR COMMUNITIES BECAUSE- THEY WERE JUST. TAKEN AND SO. THAT IS A I'M HAPPY THAT WE'RE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION AND THEY'RE ALL OF YOU ARE HAVING GUIDED US TO BE THINKING WITH YOU ALL BECAUSE- THIS CANNOT CONTINUE. AND YOU KNOW OUR REFORMS CANNOT JUST COME AFTER THE FACT AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE LEARNED IS THAT. WE HAVE JUST NOT GONE FAR ENOUGH YOU KNOW AT PEOPLE CALIFORNIA IT WITH A LOT OF OUR PARTNERS ACROSS THE STATE THOUGHT REALLY HARD TO. GET PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN PAST COUPLE YEARS AGO I PERSONALLY FROM BEING IN LAST NIGHT'S AND- WHAT I WAS ABLE TO WITNESS IN THESE KIND OF REFORMS IS THE OPPORTUNITY THAT THAT BRINGS TO FAMILIES. PEOPLE LIKE JOY WILLIAMS MY COLLEAGUE WHO IS NOT ONLY ABLE TO JUST LIKE SPEAK PROUDLY OF THE FACT THAT HE HAS A COMMUNITY MEMBER WAS ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THESE REFORMS. BUT THAT IT HAS ACTUALLY OPENED THE DOOR FOR HIM AND HIS FAMILY AND HIS DIGNITY AS A MAN OF COLOR IN THE STATE. AND SO WHEN I THINK ABOUT THIS WHIMS- WE ARE ALSO REMINDED THAT THEY'RE JUST NOT HAVING GONE FAR ENOUGH AND AN EXAMPLE HEARING SACRAMENTO. WAS A FEW YEARS AGO MISTER JOSEPH MAN WAS GUNNED DOWN IN DEL PASO HEIGHTS BRIGHT DAYLIGHT. AND AFTER THAT COMMUNITY GATHER AND WE WERE ABLE TO PASS A FEW LOCAL REFORMS AROUND GETTING LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO WEAR THEIR BODY CAMERAS AND SO WE CELEBRATED RIGHT WE SET OF COMMUNITY WE ALWAYS CELEBRATE EVERY LITTLE WINDOW WE HALF BECAUSE THAT'S ALL. WE ARE ABLE TO BRING BACK TO OUR COMMUNITIES. BUT THEN. A FEW YEARS LATER. WE FIND OURSELVES AGAIN HAVING THIS CRITICAL CONVERSATION AFTER ANOTHER LOVE ONE ANOTHER LOVE ONE WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM OUR COMMUNITY HERE IN SACRAMENTO. AFTER THE MURDER OF MR STEPHON CLARK WE COME TO FIND OUT THAT WE DIDN'T GO FAR ENOUGH. I GETTING THE BODY CAMERAS IN USING UP OUR TAX MONEY TO MAKE BODY CAMERAS. AVAILABLE TO OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE HADN'T GONE FAR ENOUGH JUST DOING THAT. BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T EVEN REQUIRED TO WEAR HIM ON. AT ALL TIMES RIGHT SO THEN. WE AT THE COMMUNITY AGAIN ARE HAVING A CONVERSATION AROUND. LIKE IS THAT IN A SUBTLE WAY OF LOOKING AT HOW WE SPEND OUR LIMITED RESOURCES RIGHT- I WAS HAPPY TO HEAR THAT- MR GABRIEL MUCH AND- A LOT OF CONVERSATION IS LIKE HOW DO WE MAKE RESOURCES AVAILABLE AND THE REALITY IS THAT YOU HAVE EXPERTS IN THE COMMUNITY. RIGHT WE DON'T NEED TO ALWAYS SPEND A LOT OF A TON OF MONEY ON LET'S BRING THESE EXPERTS THE EXPERTS LIVE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE ALWAYS SAY. AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZING IS PEOPLE CLOSEST TO THE PAIN HOW THE SOLUTIONS TO THEIR PROBLEMS AND I REALLY HAVE TO HEAR THE- THE PROFESSORS EARLIER THIS MORNING. TALKING ABOUT HOW. THE COMMUNITY HAS TO BE INSTRUMENTAL IN THIS CONVERSATION- I HAVE AS AN ORGANIZER BEEN WORKING WITH BOTH NOT JUST IN IN THE ISSUES OF HOUSING HOMELESSNESS IMMIGRATION. ALL THOSE ISSUES ARE DIRECTLY LINKED AND INTERTWINED WITH THIS KOMMER CONVERSATION AROUND POLICE REFORM- WHEN I TALKED TO OUR IMMIGRANT FAMILIES IN SACRAMENTO. I WANT TO SPEAK OF GLORIA WHO GLORIA TELLS ME GABBY I THERE'S NO WAY I'M GOING TO CALL LAW ENFORCEMENT. ONE BECAUSE I'M UNDOCUMENTED TO IN IN PART OF THE REASON WAS BECAUSE LOCALLY. WE HAVE TO FIGHT TO END THE NICE CONTRACT. WITH OUR LOCAL SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT LAKE CHARLES CONTINUES TO BE BROKEN IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND SO. HAVING COMMUNITY CENTER SOLUTIONS THAT OUR COMMUNITIES ARE NOT JUST BROUGHT BROUGHT ONTO THIS CONVERSATION AS AN AFTERTHOUGHT THEY CANNOT CONTINUE TO BE USED AS FOCUS GROUPS BUT I THINKING PARTNERS WHO ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT THEY NEED. WHO ACTUALLY KNOW THE ROLE THEY WANT LAW ENFORCEMENT TO PLAY IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND SO. WHEN I WHEN I REFLECT BACK ON WHAT OUR LEADERS ACROSS THE STATE I PEOPLE CALIFORNIA. HAVE BEEN FIGHTING FOR SO MANY HERE'S ITS ACCOUNTABILITY TRYING. IF WE DON'T HAVE A WAY TO HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE TO MOLD LIKE IF AN OFFICER. I DON'T KNOW LIKE I'M I JUST I'M NOT BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE IT AND I AM SURE THAT I CAN ABILITY SUCH A BROAD. LANGUAGE BUT- LAKE ONE WAY THAT WE THINK ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY IS THAT SOMEONE THAT HAS DIRECT TIES TO RACIST ORGANIZATIONS SHOULD NOT BE POLICING OUR COMMUNITY. WE SHOULD BE LOOKING INTO THAT AND HOW ARE WE BEING TRANSPARENT ABOUT THAT AND THAT A LOT OF THE RESOURCES THAT WE ARE USING WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS OVERSIGHT AND THAT THERE IS A COMMUNITY OVERSIGHT WITH- YOU KNOW A DIVERSE COMMUNITY OVERSIGHT SO THAT- WE ARE ACTUALLY FEELING LIKE THEY'RE NOT JUST. THAT COMMUNITIES NOT JUST COMING A LONG **** JUST A FOCUS GROUP BUT ACTUALLY AS A THINKING PARTNER. THEN SO THE LAST THING I WOULD SAY IS THAT. I CELEBRATED WE CELEBRATE ALL OF THE REFORMS THAT HAVE HAPPENED BECAUSE- REGARDLESS OF WHERE WE STAND IN THE SPECTRUM WE KNOW THAT FAMILIES HAVE HAD OPPORTUNITIES WE KNOW THAT IF THEY SOME LICENSE BUT NOT ENOUGH LIVES. IN SEOUL FOR US ENSURING THAT YOU KNOW TRAININGS ARE IMPORTANT. BUT WE ALSO COMMUNITY HAS SEEN HOW LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS USE TRAINING TO DE ESCALATE. FOR SOME COMMUNITIES BUT NOT DE ESCALATE WITH OUR COMMUNITIES COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ACROSS THE STATE. AND I KNOW THAT THERE WAS MENTION TO DATE EARLIER INDIA IS SUPER IMPORTANT. AND EVERY TIME WE LOOK AT DATA WE KEEP ON SEEING THAT THESE POLICIES THAT WE CONTINUE TO PASS ARE NOT IMPLEMENTED.-EQUALLY AMONG THE SPECTRUM IN THE STATE AND SO I THINK. WHEN WE LOOK AT THE MOMENT THAT WE ARE INWHAT THIS MOMENT IS REQUIRING OF. YOU ALL OF OUR COMMUNITY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IS TO TRULY REIMAGINE. COVE IT HAS A REALLY OPEN THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO. REALLY THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX ABOUT WHAT THESE REFORMS CAN LOOK LIKE. AND SO I JUST WANT TO. REALLY ENCOURAGE US TO. DO WE TRANSFER ABOUT THE EXPECTATIONS AND HAVE CLARITY ABOUT. WHAT WE ARE HOLDING PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE TO- AND SO WITH THAT I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR INVITING US AND HAVING A FEW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF A CERTAIN INCREASING WANNA GIVE YOU AMPLE NOT ENOUGH TIME THIS PANEL AS WE'VE GIVEN- TO THE PREVIOUS PADDLE SO WITHTHAT I WOULD ASK THE FIRST QUESTION THEY WOULD ASK MEMBERS- TO ASK QUESTIONS AND PLEASE. GET MY ATTENTION- TO QUEUE UP MS REYES SMITH GONZALEZ- IN ORDER SO MY FIRST QUESTION TO YOU IS- GABBY AND THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE ALL THAT YOU HAVE ARTICULATED THUS FAR WHAT IS NEEDED TO INCREASE TRUST BETWEEN OUR COMMUNITY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. THAT WOULD BE THE FIRST QUESTION. IN YOUR OPINION. EIGHT SO I THINK IN MY OPINION IN MY OPINION- THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS ARE NEEDED BUT ONE OF THEM HAS TO BE- HAVING COMMUNITY REALLY SHARE HOW THE ROLE THAT THEY WANT TO SEE AND HOW THEY WANT TO INTERACT IN THEIR EXPECTATIONS OF THEIR DEPARTMENTS- THAT HAS TO BE. AT THE CENTER OF IT BECAUSE WE CANNOT. WHEN UNITY IS NOT ABLE TO TRUST THE PEOPLE THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO SERVE THEM. IT'S KIND OF YOU KNOW COUNTER TO IT IF TO CONTINUE TO. YOU KNOW- TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE SOLUTIONS ARE WHEN YOU KNOW THE COMMUNITY HAS TO DO THAT IN. AND THERE ARE SOME OTHER MOUNT MODELS BEFORE. BEFORE THE MURDER OF MR STEPHON CLARK TOOK PLACE IN SACRAMENTO. AT THE CRIMINAL ACT WE HAD BEEN CONVENING FOR A YEAR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. PARTNERS IN THE ECOSYSTEM SAID WE SET ALL OVER THE SPECTRUM AROUND- ON YOU KNOW THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND THEY WERE JUST MEETING BREAKING BREAD. AND THEN. MISTER STEPHON CLARK WAS TAKING AWAY FROM OUR COMMUNITIES IN SUCH A VIOLENT WAY THAT COMMUNITY MEMBERS NO LONGER WANTED TO BE SITTING IN THE TABLE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T FEEL LIKE THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE WERE HAVING A YEAR BEFORE FOR A WHOLE YEAR TOGETHER WE'RE GOING ANYWHERE AND SO IT HAS TO BE NOT JUST A LISTENING BUT THE ACTION PIECE- I THINK THOSE TWO THINGS HAVE TO BE THERE COMMUNITY HAS TO HAVE A LEVEL OF POWER WHERE THEY FEEL LIKE. THESE POLICIES HAVE TEETH THAT ARE HELPING MOVE THE AGENDA FORWARD. AND ONE QUESTION MR HARE'S IN YOUR LEGAL OPINION WHAT CHANGED WHAT CHANGE IN LAW CHANGES A LAW. DO YOU THINK- COULD IMPROVE THE JUSTICE SYSTEM TODAY. SO TWO THINGS- THE FIRST CHANGE I THINK WHAT WE NEED AND WE NEEDED A LAST SESSION WAS WAS THAT THE BRADY LIST- SO THAT OUR DISTRICT ATTORNEYS. NO WHETHER OR NOT TO PUT COPS WHO HAVE HAD ISSUES WITH HONESTY AND INTRUDE. ON THE STAND. TO TESTIFY ABOUT THE ARREST THAT THEY HAVE MADE WITH REGARD TO SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN- CONFINED BECAUSE OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. AND THEN YOU KNOW WHAT THIS LEADS TO YOU KNOW WHEN THIS COP IS FINALLY FIGURED OUT WHEN PEOPLE REALIZE THAT THIS PERSON HAS A RECORD OF MALFEASANCE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT CONDUCT. ALL OF THAT. WORK FOR JUSTICE IS UNDER THOSE OFFENDERS ARE RELEASED FROM PRISON BECAUSE THEIR THEIR CASES ARE BROUGHT INTO DOUBT AND IT PUTS A FINANCIAL STRAIN ON A SYSTEM EIGHTY ROADS TRUST IN THE LAW AND CONFIDENCE IN OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM. IS A CANCER AND THIS BRADY LIST WILL HELP FIX THAT PROBLEM NOT ONLY THAT THE SECOND THING I WANTED TO MENTION WAS THERE NEED TO BE A LAW ON THE BOOKS THAT CRIMINALIZES- LAW ENFORCEMENT SPEECH THAT ADVOCATES FOR. VIOLATING THE RIGHTS OF CITIZENS IN PARTICULAR KILLING CITIZENS BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT'S GOING ON- WHETHER IT'S IN THE FORM OF BENDING BADGES TO SIGNIFY. AS A SYMBOL OF YOUR POSITION SOCIAL POSITION IN THE AGENCY OR GETTING A TATTOO. TOOL SOME OF THESE LITTLE CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN COPS ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD THAT ARE ACCIDENTALLY CAPTURED ON THE BODY CAMS WHEN THEY'RE- TALKING ABOUT JUDICIAL OFFICERS AND CIVILIANS AND USING RACIAL SLURS. THIS IS WHAT'S GOING ON UNDER THE WATER AND IT'S CAUSING A PROBLEM IT'S CAUSING YOUNG IMPRESSIONABLE COPS WHO WANT TO BE LIKE THE COOL GUY APRICOT BAR THAT EVERYONE LISTENS TO WHEN THEY HAVE A STORY ABOUT USING- THEY'RE THEIR THEIR- DUTY SERVICE WEAPON IN THE LINE OF DUTY. OR SOME INTERESTING STORY ABOUT USE OF FORCE THEY WANT TO BE LIKE THIS GUY THEY WANT TO LIVE UP TO HIS EXPECTATIONS. AND. THIS IS THE CULTURAL CANCER THAT IS THIS WITHIN OUR LONG FOR AGENTS AND THE TO BE SCHOOL. IN THE NEEDS TO BE. A LETTUCE. SOLUTION WITH T. THAT ADDRESSES THAT PROBLEM NOW I'M SORRY OF MR DIFFERENT ONE MORE THING WE HAVE ROLES. NOT CRIMINALIZE CIVILIAN SPEECH. LIKE FOR EXAMPLE INCITEMENT TO RIOT. WHEN SOMEONE STANDS UP AND SAYS YOU KNOW SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF WITH BURNS DOWN AND PEOPLE DO IT. THEY CAN GO TO JAIL. I THINK THOSE SAME RULES THAT APPLY TO OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH VIEWPOINT YOU TALKED ABOUT THE BRADY LIST- THERE SIX ATTORNEYS ON THE SELECT COMMITTEE THERE'S TWO FOUR POLICE OFFICERS BUT THERE'S PEOPLE WATCHING THAT DON'T KNOW WHAT THE BRADY LIST IS CAN YOU ARTICULATE THAT REAL QUICK AND THEN AFTER THAT WE'RE GOING TO MISS REYES MISS GONZALEZ IS TO MAYES. YES I THOUGHT SO WHAT WHEN A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER ENGAGES IN MISCONDUCT IN THE LINE OF DUTY THAT BRINGS INTO QUESTION THEIR- ABILITY TO BE HONEST AND TRUTHFUL- OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF SIGNIFICANT MISCONDUCT. THEY SHOULD BE PUT ON A LIST SO THAT WHEN THERE IS A CRIMINAL CASE THAT THEY'RE INVOLVED WITH THAT IS REFERRED TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY TO PROSECUTE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SHOULD KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THAT OFFICER IS A CREDIBLE WITNESS OR NOT. AND THE IMPACT OF THAT BRADY LIST IS THAT IF YOU HAVE A COP ON THE STREET. THAT CANNOT BE USED AS A WITNESS IN A CRIMINAL CASE. THE IMPACT OF THAT IS THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER IS NO GOOD AS A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. AND SO THEY GET REMOVED FROM THE STREET. BACK COPS GET TAKEN OFF THE STREETS NOW I'M AWARE THAT- SENATOR ROBERT HAVE A- GREAT LIFT BILL- BUT BECAUSE OF FINANCIAL ISSUES WITH RETAIL. AND WE NEED TO REVISIT THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS RACING UP TO BAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH THIS IS BEEN- VERY. INFORMATIVE BEGINNING WITH DR HANNEKE FROM CAL POLY POMONA YEAH A BRONCOS- AND EVERYBODY ELSE OF MR HARRISON AND MR WHO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PRESENTING. I THINK THAT WHEN I WHEN I THINK OF ANY KIND OF REFORM I ALWAYS THINK WE DON'T NEED TO REINVENT THE WHEEL WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHO HAS DONE IT AND DONE IT RIGHT AND LET'S FIGURE OUT JUST LIKE THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED ABOUT EDUCATION WHO ELSE HAS DONE IT AND DONE IT RIGHT SO THAT WE CAN THEN FIGURE OUT HOW WE THEN. USE THE BEST. BEST PRACTICES TO THEM BRING IT HERE TO CALIFORNIA- I. I WAS REMINDED THIS MORNING. OF HARTFORD CONNECTICUT THAT HAS NOW DONE. THERE THERE ARE POLICE REFORM PACKAGE THAT GOING INTO EFFECT NOW AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WERE RECOMMENDED THERE THAT HAVE ALSO BEEN RECOMMENDED BY SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES ONE WAS A POLICING CORRECTION OFFICERS MUST INTERVENE IF THEY SEE EXCESSIVE FORCE. AND NO RETALIATION IF THEY DO INTERVENE. MY COLLEAGUE MR HOLDEN INTRODUCED THAT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL IDEA TO INVESTIGATE USE OF FORCE MY COLLEAGUE MISTER MCCOURT MCCARTY- SUCCESSFULLY WAS ABLE TO BRING THAT FORWARD. MISTER BRETT CENTER BRADFORD ON DECERTIFICATION- IT AND HARTFORD CONN DARIEN CONNECTICUT THE STATE NOW SAYS IF YOU'RE JUST CERTIFIED AS A POLICE OFFICER YOU CAN'T EVEN HOLD A JOB AS A SECURITY OFFICER YOU'RE DONE. ANOTHER WAS FALSE REPORTS- FOR BOGUS NINE ONE ONE CALLS WHICH MR ALREADY JONES SAWYER. YEAH IT. INTRODUCED AND DID THE LIMITED GOVERNMENT IMMUNITY PROTECTION FOR POLICE WE TALKED ABOUT THAT AND NUMBER SPEAKERS HAVE TALKED ABOUT THAT. I ALSO APPRECIATED THE COMMENT TO OF FROM IS THAT I HOPE ABOUT THIS IS CONTACTED LAW ENFORCEMENT AND DOING AWAY WITH THAT SOMETHING THAT WE ABSOLUTELY HAVETO LOOK AT IF WE'RE LOOKING AT TRUST BETWEEN. OUR NOT JUST THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY BUT THE LATINO COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND IT ISN'T ONLY LATINOS THAT ARE IMMIGRANTS WE HAVE IMMIGRANTS FROM HAITI AND FROM SO MANY OTHER. COUNTRIES THAT HAVE AN ISSUE WITH WITH TRUST WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT SO WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE BIG PICTURE OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIND SOLUTIONS. ON THE BACKGROUND CHECKS THAT HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT- NOT ONLY FOR CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR THOSE WHO ARE GOING TO SERVE AND PROTECT OUR COMMUNITY AS MR PERSON YOU TALKED ABOUT BUT ALSO THOSE WHO ARE MEMBERS OF A RACIST GROUP OR- HAVE THOSE RACES TENDED TENDENCIES. THE BRADY LIST THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT- AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT EDUCATION WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT EDUCATION AND MENTAL HEALTH AS WELL. THERE'S SO MUCH THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE I THINK THAT WITH AGAIN WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REFORM IT'S RECOGNIZING WE HAVE AN ISSUE. AND THAT'S WHY THE SPEAKER CONVENE TO THIS SELECT COMMITTEE WE'VE MADE IT CLEAR IT'S NOT WINDOW DRESSING AND IT CAN'T JUST BE WORDS THAT WE'RE NOT JUST WINDOW DRESSING IT HAS TO BE ACTION AND THIS IS TOUGH ACTION. IT'S GOING TO TAKE COURAGE IT'S A WEEK WE ALL HAVE TO BE BOLD ABOUT WHAT IT IS WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT. BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE INCLUDE ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS SO THE COMMUNITY CAN JUST BE FOR LISTENING. THE COMMITTEE HAS TO BE PART OF THE ACTION I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH YOU MR HOLE AND I APPRECIATE THOSE. COMMENTS YOU HAD A FEW GOOD QUOTES I DIDN'T HAVE TO HIM DOWN. SOME I WATCHED TAPE LATER. ON IT'S MAKING SURE. ALSO THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS AT THE TABLE I THINK IT WAS OUR VICES FUTURE VICE PRESIDENT AYE MISS COMELY HERIS ARE RETURNING FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO SAID THAT BAD COPS ARE BAD FOR GOOD COPS. THAT'S ABSOLUTELY THE TRUTH AND ARE GOOD COPS WANT TO BE AT THE TABLE THEY WANT TO HELP FIND THE SOLUTIONS AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT I WANT THOSE GOOD COPS WITH US BECAUSE WE HAVE A WHOLE LOT I HAVE SOME IN MY FAMILY. WE HAVE A LOT OF GOOD COPS IT WANT TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION THAT WANT TO BE PART OF THAT COMMUNITY POLICING AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT. SO I AM ABSOLUTELY LOOKING FORWARD TO I KNOW TODAY WAS THE HISTORY REFORM OF POLICE. RIGHT TO SUE. AND I LOOKING FORWARD EVERY MEETING THAT WE HAVE AND I HOPE THAT YOU. FOR A IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE PART OF THIS SO I WANT TO THANK I DON'T HAVE A QUESTION I JUST WANTED TO GIVE MY COMMENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS REYES MS GONZALEZ. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU MR IS A GREAT WITH EVERYTHING SHE SAID BUT I THINK BOTH OF YOU- FOR COMING FORWARD AND REALLY- SPEAKING AS MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY AND REPRESENT THE VIEWS. OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS BECAUSE THERE IS. SOMETIMES IN THIS DISCUSSION SUCH A DISCONNECT- AND IT CAN'T WE CAN'T LEGISLATE WITH THAT DISCONNECT I MEAN IT YOU KNOW I THINK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME WHEN I'M UP HERE. AND I'M THINKING THROUGH CERTAIN THINGS HOW MUCH SOMETHING COST- HOW IT'S GONNA AFFECT THESE DIFFERENT LAWS HOW THE INTERPLAY EVERYTHING LIKE THAT MAKE A HOME AND THAT'S NOT WHAT MY NEIGHBORS THINK ABOUT. MY NEIGHBORS THINKING IF I CALL THE POLICE ARE THEY GOING TO CALL ICE. AM I GONNA GET DEPORTED RIGHT IN SO IT'S REALLY. IMPORTANT TO HAVE YOUR VOICES IN THIS I JUST- MYSTERY HOW WHEN YOU WERE TALKING I WAS REMEMBER IN ACTUALLY I USED TO BE AN ORGANIZER AS WELL. AND I WAS. I WAS REMEMBERING ONE REALLY GOOD- EVENT WE HAD BASICALLY WITH OUR POLICE CHIEF- WE HAPPEN TO HAVE A VERY. GOOD POLICE CHIEF IN SAN DIEGO WHO IS RESPONSIVE WHEN WE WOULD CALL THEM BUT WE HAD OUR- ADOPT MANY UNION MEMBERS COME IN AND HIM COME. IN TO DISCUSS JUST THE ISSUE OF CARS BEING IMPOUNDED THIS WAS BEFORE WE HAD THE RIGHT HAVE LICENSES. AND BECAUSE WE YOU KNOW THERE WAS. THERE WAS COMPANY POLICY IF YOU WILL AND THEN THERE WAS WHAT WAS ACTUALLY HAPPENING. AND IT WAS A AN AMAZINGLY POWERFUL INTERACTION AND- ON THAT ONE POLICY ISSUE AND WE GOT SOME RESULTS OUT OF IT BECAUSE HE REALLY HEARD FROM THE COMMUNITY AND THEY THEY MADE SUGGESTIONS AND- THERE THERE BECAME THIS LIKE. EMAIL BACK AND FORTH IF THE OFFICER ACTUALLY IMPOUNDED A CAR IN SO THAT OFFICERS FOUND OUT REALLY QUICK IF THEY IMPOUNDED THE CAR OUTSIDE OF POLICY THAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY TO BE TOLD ABOUT. THE COMMUNITY. AND IT BECAME AND LITTLE ACCOUNTABILITY. BUT I WAS THINKING- YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT UTILIZING THE COMMUNITY AS PART OF THE SOLUTION. BUT IS THERE ANYTHING THAT. IT'S SO HARD TO PUT THAT LOCK RIGHT AND I'M I'M WONDERING IF THERE IS IF WE HAVE EXAMPLES MAYBE FROM OTHER STATES. OR IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT SCALABLE WHEN IT COMES TO- SOME OF THESE ISSUES NOT NOT AT. NESSA ARE ARE TRANSPARENCY WHICH WE NEED A LAW BUT- COMMUNITY POLICING MAYBE SOME OF THE REFORMS THAT WOULD HELP BUILD TRUST IS THERE ANYTHING OUT THERE THAT THAT WE HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF OR OR THAT YOU HAVE SEEN. I'M THAT WOULD BE SCALABLE OR EVEN LEGISLATIVE LEE. IT'LL ALLOWING US AYE I GUESS THROUGH THE BUDGET WE COULD DO SOME BUT LIKE. WHAT THINGS THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY LEGISLATING. THE FIRM I HAVE ONE IDEA AND IT COMES FROM. SOMETHING RECENT I WAS I WAS LISTENING TO NPR. AND THERE IS A STORY ABOUT A LONG FORCING OFFICER I THINK IT WAS DOWN IN LA. SHE WAS- AND I COULDN'T SEE WHAT SHE WAS DOING ITS COULD HEAR. SHE WAS DRESSED IN PLAIN CLOTHES I KNOW THAT- AND EVERYONE KNEW SHE WAS A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER BUT SHE AND SHE WAS OUT IN THE COMMUNITY I THINK SHE WAS SITTING AT A TABLE IN FRONT OF A RESTAURANT. CHATTING UP SOME FOLKS FROM THE COMMUNITY SHE WAS ON THE JOB. BUT SHE WAS. IN REALITY SOCIALIZING AND HAVING A GOOD TIME. AND I MEAN TO ME I WAS THINKING LIKE WOW THAT IS THAT'S BEAUTIFUL THAT'S AMAZING THAT'S- PRETTY MUCH EXACTLY WHAT POLICING SHOULD BE BECAUSE- POLICING. HAVE TO INVOLVE THE COMMUNITY. IN ORDER FOR CRIMES TO BE SOLVED EFFICIENTLY THERE NEEDS TO BE COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT AND IN ORDER. FOR ALL OF THIS TO OCCUR THERE NEEDS TO BE TRUST. THEY NEED TO BE TRUST THAT THIS LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER REALLY CARES ABOUT ME MY WELL BEING. KNOWS ME AND I TRUST HER. AND THIS IS HOW THAT TRUST IS BUILT. NOW I'VE SEEN- YOU KNOW VARIOUS. FILMS ON YOUTUBE OR WHATEVER OF COPS PLAYING BASKETBALL FULLUNIFORM BADGE AND GUN AND ALL THAT. AND IT SEEMS KIND OF SCRIPTED YEAH THAT'S NICE. BUT WE CAN DO MORE NOW AS FAR AS A LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION. IT'S INTERESTING HOW TO CRAFT. A LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION FOR THAT BECAUSE- REALLY DEPEND ON IN THE- APART. POLICY BUT IF THERE WERE LIKE GRANTS FOR EXAMPLE THAT ENCOURAGE THAT TYPE OF BEHAVIOR. THEN AGENCIES WILL BE ALL OVER IT. AND REALLY. DO YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE PERSONNEL TO WRITE. THE PERSONALITY TYPE OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER MATTERS IN THAT REGARD- YOU CAN'T HAVE A MILITARY MINDED- VERY- ABRUPT AND FRANK PERSON GOING OUT THERE AND SOCIALIZING PEOPLE PLAYING CARDS YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO HAVE SOMEONE THAT HAS EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND I KNOW THAT THEY HAVE THOSE PERSONALITY TESTS AND WHAT NOT TO FIND OUT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE THE RIGHT FIT. AND BUT WHAT'S ALSO INTEGRAL IN VERY IMPORTANT IS EDUCATION. WE'LL GET A DEGREE IN SOCIOLOGY CRIMINAL JUSTICE SOMETHING THAT ALLOWS THEM TO HAVE A PLATFORM WITH WHICH TO ENGAGE PEOPLE. REACH A COMMON UNDERSTANDING AND FACILITATE COMMUNICATION. MISTER BASS THEY MISTER BONTA THANK YOU MISTER DAVIS CHAIR- SEMESTERS I WANTED TO CHAT WITH YOU ABOUT QUALIFIED IMMUNITY SINCE YOU ARE- SINCE YOUR ATTORNEY- I'D LOVE TO GET YOUR YOUR THOUGHTS ON YOU ACTUALLY YOUR PRESENTATION HAD BROUGHT THIS THAT BROUGHT THIS UP- JUST BEFORE THE END OF SESSION- THERE WAS SOME TALK ABOUT A BILL AND THE QUESTION ABOUT QUALIFIED. IMMUNITY AND I THINK BACK FOR IF I. IF I CAN'T FOR JUST A MOMENT I THINK BACK WHEN I WAS A YOUNG COUNCIL MEMBER. WAS TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD WHEN I FIRST. HAD GOT ELECTED TO THE CITY COUNCIL. AND HAD SAT DOWN WITH THE CITY ATTORNEY. THE CITY ATTORNEY WAS EXPLAINING TO ME- THAT- I'M GOING TO GET SUED THATTHE CITY'S GET SUED AND WON- THAT THE CITY GET SUED OFTENTIMES THE COUNCIL MEMBERS. GET SUED BUT DON'T WORRY- BECAUSE YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS IT GONNA. END UP BEING IMPACTED BY THAT EVEN THOUGH YOU'LL BE NAMED- THERE IS NO- THERE'S NO LIABILITY TO YOU IN ESSENCE YOU'RE IMMUNE FROM FROM THAT THAT THAT LIABILITIES CAUGHT QUALIFIED IMMUNITY. AND IF YOU'RE A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER IN ESSENCE YOU'RE ACTING ON BEHALF OF- OF GOVERNMENT REINFORCING. STATED CALIFORNIA LAWYER AND FORCING THE LAWS THAT ARE ON ON THE BOOKS. AND SO THE QUESTION IS IF YOU DID AWAY WITH QUALIFIED IMMUNITY. A WOULD. WHAT DOES THAT DO TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THEN. WOULD THEY BE THINKING TO THEMSELVES THE RISK IS TOO GREAT FOR ME TO DO THIS JOB- BECAUSE THE LIABILITY TO ME AND MY FAMILY- THAT WOULD BE TOO GREAT SO AT TO TALK TO ME A LITTLE ABOUT ABOUT QUALIFIED IMMUNITY WHAT WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY REFORM IN REGARDS OF QUALIFIED IMMUNITY OKAY. SO. BEFORE I GET INTO THE WEEDS HERE- THE LEGISLATIVE ANSWER FOR THE QUALIFIED IMMUNITY ISSUE HAS TO BE IRONED OUT- AND SO- I'M NOT. TRYING TO PRESENT. A SPECIFIC ANSWER TO THE ISSUE QUALIFY MANY I JUST WANT TO TALK ABOUT A GENERALLY. SO AT ITS CORE WILL QUALIFIED IMMUNITY IS. IF YOU ARE AN ACTOR A GOVERNMENT ACTOR. ON YOUR OWN DOING YOUR JOB ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT. IF YOU HAVE A REASONABLE BELIEVE THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS RIGHT IS LEGAL THE PROCREATIVE. THEN YOU'RE PROTECTED YOU CAN'T BE PHYSICALLY ECONOMICALLY ON THE HOOK FOR THE HARM BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU WERE IN FACT WRONG. AND THAT REASON ABILITY STANDARD. IT'S PRETTY LOW. NOW IF WE DID AWAYCOMPLETELY AND ENTIRELY WITH QUALIFIED IMMUNITY YOU COULD HAVE COPS BEING PERSONALLY SUED FOR VIOLATING PEOPLE'S RIGHTS. NOW AS FAR AS THAT THAT SEEMS LIKE A NUCLEAR WEAPON HAYRIDE YOU YOU DON'T WANT TO. YOU DON'T WANT TO CHILL LAW ENFORCEMENT VIGILANCE RIGHT WE WANT SAFE COMMUNITIES. SO THE ANSWER SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN RIGHT. WHAT CAN WE DO TO CHANGE THIS THE LEGAL THE LEGAL STANDARD. SO THAT TOPS CA'T JUST SAY OH WELL I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND THEN GET AWAY WITH IT WHEN WHAT THE BEHAVIOR APPEARS TO BE ON ITS FACE IS THAT THIS THIS LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER BY EVERY NIGHT PRACTICAL STANDARD OF OBSERVANCE. WAS DOING THE WRONG THING BUT YET WHEN YOU GET INTO THE LEGAL WEEDS OF EVERYTHING WHEN YOU WHEN YOU GET INTO. PROVING SOMETHING IN A COURT OF LAW WITH STRICT EVIDENCE. THE THERE'S NO WAY TO ACTUALLY PROVE THAT THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER IN HIS OWN MIND DIDN'T BELIEVE. THAT WHAT HE WAS DOING IT RIGHT NOW SO- DANCER AGAIN LIE SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE. AND THIS INVOLVES A LONG DISCUSSION. ABOUT WHERE IT IS AND HOW TO FIND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR BONTA. THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP- MISTER CHAIR AND REALLY PLEASED TO BE ON ON THIS ON THIS COMMITTEE AND I APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION TODAY AND I HAVEN'T SOMETHING THAT THAT YOU SAID MATTEO STRUCK ME I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON IT AND BECAUSE I REALLY APPRECIATE IT AND IT WAS YOUR STATEMENT ABOUT THOSE CLOSEST TO THE PROBLEM. OUR BEST LOCATED TO PROVIDE SOLUTIONS AND THAT ARE THE IMPORTANCE OF IMPACTED COMMUNITIES AND THE PARTNERSHIP INTEGRATION SOLUTIONS BETWEEN POLICY MAKERS IN IMPACTED COMMUNITIES SOMEONE ASK YOU TWO QUESTIONS THE FIRST IS. WHAT WOULD BE YOUR TOP PRIORITY POLICY CHANGE I KNOW THERE'S MANY THINGS THAT WE CAN DO O HELP. FIX THE SYSTEM- IN NEED OF REFORM. BUT IF YOU PRIORITIZE THEM WITH WITH WEIGHT WHAT WOULD BE YOUR TOP PRIORITY AND THEN I WANT TO. IT MAYBE COMMENT ON THE QUESTION OF. HOW DO YOU WEIGH AND DISCERN BETWEEN. INVESTMENTS IN TRAINING. ON THE ONE HAND AND IN EDUCATION AND WHO COMES INTO THE WORK FORCE AS LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. AND POLICY CHANGE. THANK YOU SO. IT'S KIND OF HARD TO SAY LIKE WHICH WHAT I WOULD PRIORITIZE BUT I KNOW THAT- IT CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE HAD ACROSS THE STATE WITH LEADERS- RECOGNIZING THAT ON PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED THAT BLACK AND BLACK BLACK AND BROWN BODIES ARE BEING KILLED IN THE STATE- AT ALARMING RATES AND- IN THAT IT. A LOT OF OUR FOLKS DON'T NECESSARILY FEEL LIKE THEY CAN TRUST LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE. THEY ARE THEIR PERSONAL BIAS AND INTERNAL RACISM IS WHAT'S ACTUALLY DRIVING SOME OF THESE DECISION MAKING- IN PART OF THAT IS WHEN WE SEE THAT- SOMEONE THAT DOES THE MASS SHOOTING CAN BE ARRESTED PEACEFULLY RIGHT. AND SOMEONE DOES HAVING A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS IT JUST GETS KILLED RIGHT- SO DEFINITELY DENOUNCING- INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE TIGHTS DIRECT TIES PUBLIC TIES TO RACIST ORGANIZATIONS IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT GETS TO THE- ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT WE HAVE TO STAY WILL NOT TOLERATE ANYBODY SERVING OUR COMMUNITIES. WHO HAS TIED TO RACES ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN PROVE THAT. YOU KNOW IF I'M A PART OF THE KKK I SHOULD NOT BE YOU KNOW THAT MEANS THAT I NEED THAT SAYS A LOT ABOUT WHERE I SEE. YOU KNOW WHERE I STAND IN THE IN THE WORLD AND YOU SHOULDN'T BE POLICING PEOPLE OF COLOR IN OUR STATE. I JUST IT'S IMMORAL IT'S SOME IT'S A MORAL CONTRADICTION. TO SAY YOU CAN BE A GANG MEMBER AND JOINED THE POLICE FORCE RIGHT BE HAVE BEEN A FORMER MEMBER GANG MEMBER THE KKK IS. A GANG AFFILIATED ORGANIZATION AND SO NOT BEING ABLE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THOSE TWO. LIKE THAT TO ME IS SUPER IMPORTANT IN TOP PRIORITY BECAUSE I RECOGNIZE THAT. WE AT THE STATE. ARE NOT GOING TO BE TOLERATING ANY KIND OF RACIST TIGHTS TO ANY ORGANIZATION. INTERPRETER LEFT YOUR SECOND QUESTION. THE SECOND ONE WAS WE THERE'S A CALMER A GOOD REALLY GOOD CONVERSATION ABOUT THE NEED TO INVEST IN THAT THE CHANGE THAT WE WANT AND DOING THAT WITH TRAINING- LOOKING AT FOLKS- AS AS POSSIBLE WHO LOOKING FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT CAREER WITH COLLEGE DEGREES GRADUATE DEGREES DIFFERENT TYPES OF- OF- EXPERTISE- MEDICINE- LAW IT SAID DR. HOW FOR ANYTHING THAT IS FIRST IS JUST REALLY CHANGES IN POLICIES THAT SOME OF THE POLICIES THAT- IS GOMEZ REYES WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT WE PROPOSE HERE AND LEGISLATURE LIKE THE BRADY LIST LIKE THE DECERTIFICATION LIKE THE DUTY TO INTERVENE QUALIFIED. ENEMY IMMUNITY. M. AND MAYBE THEY'RE JUST DIFFERENT TRACKS IN THE BOTH IMPORT. BUT YEAH I THINK BOTH A DEFINITELY THEY'RE BOTH IMPORTANT IT'S FUNNY I WAS LIKE WRITING NO TEST AT MY COLLEAGUES SHERRI- BUT I WOULD SAY THAT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WHEN I THINK A LOT OF THE CONVERSATIONS OVER HERE IT'S AROUND LIKE ALL THE THINGS ARE ON OFFICERS PLATE RIGHT LIKE. ARE THEY THEY ARE NOT IN MY OPINION IN MY PERSONAL OPINION THEY'RE NOT THE RIGHT PERSON TO GOAL. ADDRESSED A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS CALL SO THAT MEANS THAT THEN YOU KNOW. YEAH THEY SHOULD HAVE TRAINING WHEN THEY DO ENCOUNTER THAT BUT LIKE HOW DO WE HAVE SYSTEMS IN PLACE AND PEOPLE THAT ARE SPECIALIZED IN THAT THAT THEY ARE THE ONES THAT ARE. YOU KNOW ARE GETTING THE FUNDING DOES ORGANIZATION SHOULD BE GETTING THE FUNDING TO RESPOND TO THIS KIND OF CRISES- LIKE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT BELONG IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. NO THEY'RE NOT AT EVERY SCHOOL HARPERHATED SO- BUT- YES I WOULD SAY THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE BOTH- DEFINITELY IMPORTANT RIGHT THE EDUCATION PIECE AND ALSO LIKE REALLY DISCERNING- WHERE WORKING ADDITIONAL FUNDING GOAL TO ORGANIZATIONS. THAT ARE ON THE GROUND THAT ARE DOING THE WORK. BRITISH THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THANK OUR- WE WANT TO MOVE QUICKLY TO THE PUBLIC COMMENT SECTIONS THAT WILL HAVE- OUR OPERATOR QUEUE UP WE WANT TO ASK THOSE WHO ARE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO PLEASE PREPARE YOURSELF TO COME TO THE MICROPHONE. BEHIND THE PLEXIGLAS PLEASE DON'T TOUCH THE MICROPHONE AND YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES BUT PRIOR TO THAT WE HAVE THIRTY SECONDS FOR MR MCCARTY TO MAKE A COMMENT YEAH. WELL FIRST I WANT TO THANK MY TO SACRAMENTO CONSTITUENTS FOR BEING PART OF THE PANEL. AND I KNOW WE'RE NOT LAWMAKING TODAY BUT JUST WANTED TO PINE BRIEFLY ON THIS THIS QUALIFIED IMMUNITY ISSUE THAT YOU BROUGHT UP- IT REALLY IS MANIFESTED HERE THROUGH THIS THROUGH OUR TOM PAINES CIVIL RIGHTS ACT WHICH WAS BRIEFLY DEBATED IN THAT. DECERTIFICATION ISSUE WILL COME BACK AGAIN NEXT YEAR BUT I THINK IN REALITY THERE IS A MIDDLE GROUND BECAUSE WE ASK ANY PLAINTIFFS ATTORNEY AND MY ATTORNEY COLLEAGUES HERE IN THE DIETS TO REALIZE THAT. THE DEEP POCKETS IS NOT THE POLICE OFFICER AND HIS HOUSE OR HIS PENSION IT'S THE JURISDICTION THE CITY. AND IN MY VIEW IF CITIES WERE MORE ON THE HOOK FOR WRONGFUL DEATH EXCESSIVE FORCE USE OF FORCE. THEY WOULD HAVE THEIR POLICE DEPARTMENT THEY'RE CHEAP THEY'RE LIEUTNANTS OR CAPTAINS MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE POLICING AND A MORE JUST WAY IN THE COMMUNTIES SO WE HAVE AN ARBITRARY- POLICY HERE IN SACRAMENTO IN CALIFORNIA. THROUGH THE APPLICATION BECAUSE OF COURT RULINGS THROUGH THIS- DANA AXLES I THINK THERE IS A MIDDLE GROUND IN ADDITION THERE IS ONE STATE RECENTLYTHAT DID OF A QUALIFIED IMMUNITY ADJUSTMENT. AND THEY PUT A CAP ON HOW MUCH OFFICER THINKING LIKE THE GEORGE PLAYED OFFICER OFFICER JOB AND WHATEVER HIS NAME IS. A MONETARY AMOUNT WHICH IS NOT UNREASONABLE FROM THE OFFICER'S PERSPECTIVE SO I DO THINK THERE'S A WAY TO ACHIEVE WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR AND NOT MAKE SO NO OFFICERS WHATEVER WANT THE JOB BUT HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY. FOR ACTIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH MISTER MODERATOR- IF YOU CAN PLEASE QUEUE UP ANYONE ON THE LINE. I REALIZE THAT PEOPLE HAVE ALL IN ALL PUT ME MODERATOR WILL TO GO TO YOU TO.
