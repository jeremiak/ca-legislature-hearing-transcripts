LEGISLATOR WHO IS NOW RETIRED

INVOLVING SITUATION- THAT IS

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:16.855
CHANGING QUITE RAPIDLY. BUT I

00:24:16.922 --> 00:24:19.224
THINK IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE

00:24:19.291 --> 00:24:20.926
DEFINITELY PREPARED WE'VE BEEN

00:24:20.992 --> 00:24:22.761

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:33.371
I WANT TO JUST TEST ANOTHER

00:24:33.438 --> 00:24:35.040
QUESTION WE DISCUSSED.

00:24:35.106 --> 00:24:38.009
POTENTIAL PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACTS

00:24:38.076 --> 00:24:40.412
OF THE PUBLIC CHARGE ANA

00:24:40.478 --> 00:24:41.847
DECLARATIONS TO THE FEDERAL

00:24:41.913 --> 00:24:44.749
GOVERNMENT- FOCUSED ON

00:24:44.816 --> 00:24:47.085
IMMIGRATION STATUS BUT- OUR

00:24:47.152 --> 00:24:49.487
CONCERN ABOUT. UNINTENDED

00:24:49.554 --> 00:24:52.757
CONSEQUENCES OF ELIGIBLE

00:24:52.824 --> 00:24:55.694
CHILDREN US CITIZENS NOT FULLY

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.929
REALIZING BENEFITS THEY MIGHT

00:24:57.996 --> 00:25:00.165
BE ELIGIBLE FOR HOW HOW ARE YOU

00:25:00.232 --> 00:25:01.466
AND YOUR DEPARTMENT DEALING

00:25:01.533 --> 00:25:02.934
WITH THAT SENATOR THAT'S AN

00:25:03.001 --> 00:25:04.870
EXCELLENT QUESTION AGAIN AND

00:25:04.936 --> 00:25:06.137
THIS IS TOP OF MY MIND WITH

00:25:06.204 --> 00:25:07.806
THAT- WITH THE FINALIZATION OF

00:25:07.873 --> 00:25:10.075
THE FEDERAL RULE ON MONDAY.

00:25:10.141 --> 00:25:11.610
THERE'S TWO PIECES TO THIS

00:25:11.676 --> 00:25:13.879
FIRST I THINK THAT THESE

00:25:13.945 --> 00:25:15.347
INDIVIDUALS ARE UNBELIEVABLY

00:25:15.413 --> 00:25:19.351
VULNERABLE- AND THEY ARE SCARED

00:25:19.417 --> 00:25:20.352
IN TERMS OF WHAT BENEFITS THEY

00:25:20.418 --> 00:25:23.388
MIGHT WANT TO PARTAKE IN A AND

00:25:23.455 --> 00:25:25.891
WHAT IMPACT THAT MIGHT HAVE ON

00:25:25.957 --> 00:25:26.524
THEIR STATUS WITHIN THE UNITED

00:25:26.591 --> 00:25:28.827
STATES. WHAT WE'VE DONE IS

00:25:28.894 --> 00:25:30.161
REALLY LOOKED AT HOW WE

00:25:30.228 --> 00:25:31.997
ORGANIZE COLLECTIVELY IS ONE

00:25:32.063 --> 00:25:33.565
GOVERNMENT TO THINK ABOUT OUR

00:25:33.632 --> 00:25:35.233
MESSAGING SO IT'S NOT

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:37.769
BIFURCATED AND DIFFERENT WHEN

00:25:37.836 --> 00:25:39.638
IT COMES OUT OF SACRAMENTO- AND

00:25:39.704 --> 00:25:41.573
MORE IMPORTANTLY I THINK THE

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:43.608
COMMUNITY THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO

00:25:43.675 --> 00:25:44.743
ARE IN COMMUNITIES ALL ACROSS

00:25:44.809 --> 00:25:46.177
THE STATE DON'T NECESSARILY

00:25:46.244 --> 00:25:47.479
WANT TO HEAR FROM STATE

00:25:47.545 --> 00:25:48.713
GOVERNMENT THEY WANT TO HEAR

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:50.348
FROM THE LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS

00:25:50.415 --> 00:25:52.684
THAT THEY TRUST AND VALUE. AND

00:25:52.751 --> 00:25:53.785
SO WE'VE BUILT COALITIONS

00:25:53.852 --> 00:25:55.120
WITHIN IT WITH ORGANIZATIONS

00:25:55.186 --> 00:25:57.155
ALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO

00:25:57.222 --> 00:25:57.656
EMPOWER THEM WITH THE

00:25:57.722 --> 00:25:59.457
APPROPRIATE INFORMATION SO THAT

00:25:59.524 --> 00:26:00.759
THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO

00:26:00.825 --> 00:26:01.693
RESPOND TO SOME OF THESE

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.328
QUESTIONS THE CHALLENGE SENATOR

00:26:03.395 --> 00:26:05.130
HERE IS NOT OVER COMMITTING IN

00:26:05.196 --> 00:26:06.364
TELLING SOMEBODY THAT

00:26:06.431 --> 00:26:08.266
EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE OKAY

00:26:08.333 --> 00:26:10.001
BUT REASSURING THEM THAT HERE

00:26:10.068 --> 00:26:10.936
IS THE INFORMATION THAT THEY

00:26:11.002 --> 00:26:12.804
MIGHT HAVE AND BEING ABLE TO

00:26:12.871 --> 00:26:14.039
NAVIGATE AND THROUGH THE

00:26:14.105 --> 00:26:15.440
DECISION MAKING PROCESS.

00:26:15.507 --> 00:26:17.475
EARLIER THIS WEEK WE SENT OUT

00:26:17.542 --> 00:26:19.144
TO ALL YOUR OFFICES FACT SHEETS

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:20.845
IN BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH

00:26:20.912 --> 00:26:22.781
ABOUT THIS TOPIC WE ALSO WORKED

OF CALIFORNIA ARE ADMINISTERED.

00:26:31.423 --> 00:26:32.958
BY OUR COUNTY COLLEAGUES AND

00:26:33.024 --> 00:26:34.192

ALSO HAVE THE MOST UP TO DATE

00:26:35.527 --> 00:26:37.696
INFORMATION AND SO OUR HOPE IS

00:26:37.762 --> 00:26:40.231
BY ENGAGING LOCAL COUNTERPARTS

00:26:40.298 --> 00:26:41.333

00:26:44.636 --> 00:26:46.771
THAT'S DIGESTIBLE

00:26:46.838 --> 00:26:47.339
UNDERSTANDABLE AS A WAY THAT

00:26:47.405 --> 00:26:48.473

00:28:02.947 --> 00:28:05.116
NOT OVER. OVER REASSURING AND

00:28:05.183 --> 00:28:07.085
SO I THINK PART OF IT IS BEING

00:28:07.152 --> 00:28:08.887
ABLE TO BE NIMBLE AND ADJUSTING

00:28:08.953 --> 00:28:10.655
OUR MESSAGING AS WE BETTER

00:28:10.722 --> 00:28:12.957
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CONCERNS OF

00:28:13.024 --> 00:28:14.559
THE FOLKS ON THE GROUND ARE AND

00:28:14.626 --> 00:28:16.161
I THINK ALSO LOOKING AT OUR

00:28:16.227 --> 00:28:17.529
DATA IN CASE SO IT'S AND THE

00:28:17.595 --> 00:28:18.530
TRENDS THAT ARE HAPPENING

00:28:18.596 --> 00:28:21.232
WITHIN THE DATA- I THINK THAT

00:28:21.299 --> 00:28:22.834
WE HAVE MADE A COMMITMENT TO

00:28:22.901 --> 00:28:24.069
OUR LOCAL PARTNERS AS WELL AS

00:28:24.135 --> 00:28:25.603
OUR COUNTY PARTNERS TO BE. TRUE

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:27.539
PARTNERS IN THIS EFFORT AND IN

00:28:27.605 --> 00:28:28.940
REAL TIME ADJUSTER MESSAGING

00:28:29.007 --> 00:28:31.409
SHOULD WE NEED TO ADJUSTED- I

00:28:31.476 --> 00:28:33.611
THINK WE HAVE TO BALANCE THIS

00:28:33.678 --> 00:28:35.513
NOTION OF OVER PROMISING TO

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:37.015
INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE THE WORST

00:28:37.082 --> 00:28:38.616
CASE SCENARIO IS S. TELLING

00:28:38.683 --> 00:28:40.718

00:28:49.294 --> 00:28:50.462

PARTICULARLY AS IT PERTAINS TO

00:30:43.441 --> 00:30:45.109
MENTAL HEALTH. AND THEN WHAT

00:30:45.176 --> 00:30:46.945
SPECIFIC STEPS IS AGENCY LOOK

00:30:47.011 --> 00:30:48.913
AT DOING IN TERMS EDUCATIONAL

THAT QUESTION AND I AM GRATEFUL

FOR YOU TO TAKING THE TIME

00:30:54.586 --> 00:30:56.921
YESTERDAY TO MEET WITH ME. I

00:30:56.988 --> 00:30:58.690
WILL SAY THAT I THINK FIRST AND

00:30:58.756 --> 00:31:00.091
FOREMOST WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE

00:31:00.158 --> 00:31:01.593
THAT THESE YOUTH AND CHILDREN

00:31:01.659 --> 00:31:03.261
ARE IN OUR CUSTODY IN THERE ARE

00:31:03.328 --> 00:31:05.430
KIDS. AND I THINK THAT CULTURE

00:31:05.496 --> 00:31:06.831
IN THAT MENTALITY IS REALLY

00:31:06.898 --> 00:31:08.299
IMPORTANT. BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT

00:31:08.366 --> 00:31:09.834
THIS PERSON'S CATER THAT

00:31:09.901 --> 00:31:10.802
DEPARTMENTS KID THERE ARE

00:31:10.868 --> 00:31:12.103
COLLECTIVE AND WE HAVE TO BE

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:13.938
RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM. I THINK

00:31:14.005 --> 00:31:14.806
WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH THE

00:31:14.872 --> 00:31:16.674
CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM EFFORT

00:31:16.741 --> 00:31:18.476
IS REALLY IMPORTANT. I THINK

00:31:18.543 --> 00:31:19.877
IT'S PART OF A CULTURE CHANGE

00:31:19.944 --> 00:31:21.079
BOTH AT THE STATE LEVEL AND THE

00:31:21.145 --> 00:31:22.046
COUNTY LEVEL TO THINK

00:31:22.113 --> 00:31:24.048
DIFFERENTLY. ABOUT HOW WE TAKE

00:31:24.115 --> 00:31:25.216
CARE OF THESE KIDS. AND

00:31:25.283 --> 00:31:26.651
PRIMARILY WE'VE BEEN PUTTING

00:31:26.718 --> 00:31:27.785
THESE CHILDREN IN CONGREGATE

00:31:27.852 --> 00:31:29.454
CARE SETTINGS THAT DO NOT YOUR

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:30.755
THE OUTCOMES THAT WE WANT IN

00:31:30.822 --> 00:31:32.690
FACT THEY ARE. THAT THEY'RE NOT

00:31:32.757 --> 00:31:33.925
THE RIGHT PLACE TO BE PUTTING

00:31:33.992 --> 00:31:35.560
THEM AND SO PART OF CONTINUUM

00:31:35.627 --> 00:31:37.328
OF CARE REFORM WAS TO SAY. HOW

00:31:37.395 --> 00:31:39.497
DO WE ENSURE THAT WE PLACE

00:31:39.564 --> 00:31:41.799
THESE CHILDREN. IN FAMILY

00:31:41.866 --> 00:31:43.434
SETTINGS WHERE THEY CAN THRIVE

00:31:43.501 --> 00:31:45.637
AND BE SUCCESSFUL. AND SO I AM

00:31:45.703 --> 00:31:46.971
REALLY HAPPY ABOUT THE

00:31:47.038 --> 00:31:48.640
TRANSITION THAT WE'VE MADE WITH

00:31:48.706 --> 00:31:50.475
REGARDS TO C. C. R. I THINK

00:31:50.541 --> 00:31:51.876
THERE'S A LOT MORE WORK TO BE

00:31:51.943 --> 00:31:53.411
DONE ON THAT FRONT. I THINK IN

00:31:53.478 --> 00:31:55.813
ORDER FOR US TO ENSURE THAT

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:57.148
THESE KIDS HAVE SUCCESSFUL

00:31:57.215 --> 00:31:59.317
OUTCOMES BOTH WHETHER IT'S THE-

00:31:59.384 --> 00:32:02.787
MATTER. A SIDE. I WE OUGHT NEED

00:32:02.854 --> 00:32:05.857
ENSURE THE STRIP. OR THE END.

00:32:05.923 --> 00:32:07.358
WHO TAKING. THEM HAVE

00:32:07.425 --> 00:32:08.660
APPROPRIATE TO ASSISTANCE.

00:32:08.726 --> 00:32:11.095
SUPPORT THEM. WELL IT IN THE

00:32:11.162 --> 00:32:12.096
ALL OF THEM HAS A BEHAVIORAL

00:32:12.163 --> 00:32:13.064
HEALTH CAL. AND THE PARENT

00:32:13.131 --> 00:32:14.532
KNOWS TO TURN TO OUR HOW TO

00:32:14.599 --> 00:32:16.234
DEAL WITH IT. THE TYPE OF

00:32:16.301 --> 00:32:17.669
THINGS THAT WE TO BE WORKING ON

00:32:17.735 --> 00:32:19.237
IT ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THESE

00:32:19.304 --> 00:32:21.339
ARE SUCCESSFUL. I AM PRETTY

00:32:21.406 --> 00:32:25.777
COMP THAT OR CALL. HAS NEEDLE.

00:32:25.843 --> 00:32:29.147
DO I. THAT WE- DON'T. OUT I

00:32:29.213 --> 00:32:31.215
THINK GOT LOTS MORE WORK DO AND

00:32:31.282 --> 00:32:33.017
POP OF IT IS S. S. COMING TO.

00:32:33.084 --> 00:32:35.153
AND BREAKING TO. THIS I THINK

00:32:35.219 --> 00:32:36.788
THAT. SOME OF THE HIGH NEEDS IT

00:32:36.854 --> 00:32:39.290
SO AB TWO. EIGHT THE- PAST.

00:32:39.357 --> 00:32:42.427
LAST I'D- REALLY. IT ON IF.

00:32:42.493 --> 00:32:44.329
ABOUT HOW. BRING TO. A SYSTEM

00:32:44.395 --> 00:32:45.363
OF CARE FOR THESE CHILDREN NOT

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:47.332
MULTIPLE SYSTEMS BUT ONE SYSTEM

00:32:47.398 --> 00:32:48.399
WHETHER THEY'RE GETTING

00:32:48.466 --> 00:32:51.602
SERVICES FROM MEDICAID OR THE

00:32:51.669 --> 00:32:52.804
REGIONAL CENTER SPORTS. ED THAT

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:53.371
WE'RE THINKING ABOUT IT FROM

00:32:53.438 --> 00:32:54.472
THE PERSPECTIVE OF THIS IS THE

00:32:54.539 --> 00:32:56.641
KID. AND HERE THE KIDS NEEDS

00:32:56.708 --> 00:32:57.408
AND WE'RE WRAPPING OURSELVES

00:32:57.475 --> 00:32:59.377
AROUND THOSE NEEDS- AND SO I

00:32:59.444 --> 00:33:00.845
LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THIS

00:33:00.912 --> 00:33:02.013
CONVERSATION WITH YOU AND OTHER

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:04.048
COLLEAGUES. I THINK WE ARE ARE

00:33:04.115 --> 00:33:06.317
NOW MEASURING OUR SUCCESS WITH

00:33:06.384 --> 00:33:07.819
REGARDS TO SEIZE HERE THERE'S A

00:33:07.885 --> 00:33:09.420
LOT MORE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE

00:33:09.487 --> 00:33:11.356
DONE. BUT I'M REALLY PROUD OF

00:33:11.422 --> 00:33:13.725
WHERE WE'VE COME TODAY. EIGHTY

00:33:13.791 --> 00:33:15.059
MORE WE CAN DO ON ON THE

00:33:15.126 --> 00:33:17.061
EDUCATIONAL SIDE OF IT. YEAH I

00:33:17.128 --> 00:33:18.196
MEAN I THINK PART OF IT IS OUR

00:33:18.262 --> 00:33:19.430
PARTNERSHIP WITH- WITH THE

00:33:19.497 --> 00:33:20.932
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AS PART

00:33:20.998 --> 00:33:22.567
OF THIS TWENTY EIGHTY THREE

00:33:22.633 --> 00:33:24.268
WORK WE BROUGHT THEM INTO OUR-

00:33:24.335 --> 00:33:27.138
INTO OUR- A FULL THEN. ARE

00:33:27.205 --> 00:33:29.374
REALLY THINKING ABOUT HOW WE-

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.541
ALIGN BOTH THE HEALTH SIDE IN

00:33:30.608 --> 00:33:32.443
THE EDUCATION SIDE BECAUSE- IF

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:34.178
YOU SEND A KID TO SCHOOL AND

00:33:34.245 --> 00:33:35.513
THEY DON'T HAVE THE APPROPRIATE

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:37.648
NUTRITION OR THE- ROOF OVER

00:33:37.715 --> 00:33:38.416
THEIR HEADS. YOU KNOW THE

00:33:38.483 --> 00:33:39.751
EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES ARE NOT

00:33:39.817 --> 00:33:42.086
GONNA BE THERE SIMILARLY. TO

00:33:42.153 --> 00:33:42.687
HEALTH OUTCOMES I MEAN WE CAN

00:33:42.754 --> 00:33:44.422
GIVE SOMEBODY HEALTH INSURANCE

00:33:44.489 --> 00:33:45.490
BUT IF THEY DON'T HAVE FOOD ON

00:33:45.556 --> 00:33:46.691
THE TABLE IF THEY DON'T HAVE

00:33:46.758 --> 00:33:47.392
HOUSING IF THEY DON'T HAVE

00:33:47.458 --> 00:33:48.993
ACCESS TO TRANSPORTATION. WE'RE

00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:49.927
NOT GOING TO SEE THE SAME

00:33:49.994 --> 00:33:51.662
OUTCOMES AND SO I THINK PART OF

00:33:51.729 --> 00:33:52.597
IT IS MAKING SURE THAT WERE

00:33:52.663 --> 00:33:54.198
SPEAKING AS ONE SYSTEM. AND

00:33:54.265 --> 00:33:55.700
WE'RE WORKING ON THAT AND I'M

00:33:55.767 --> 00:33:56.501
PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN

00:33:56.567 --> 00:33:57.735
MAKE SOME COULD PRETTY STRONG

00:33:57.802 --> 00:33:59.137
PROGRESS IN THE COMING MONTHS

00:33:59.203 --> 00:34:00.938

IN SAN DIEGO. A FEW YEARS AGO

00:36:31.455 --> 00:36:34.191
AND BASED ON A STATE AUDIT AND-

00:36:34.258 --> 00:36:36.360
LEGISLATURE REFORMS AND

00:36:36.427 --> 00:36:38.796
RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE WE SEEN AN

00:36:38.863 --> 00:36:40.998
IMPACT ON THAT AND I'LL MAKE

00:36:41.065 --> 00:36:41.766
THE QUESTION A LITTLE BIT

00:36:41.832 --> 00:36:43.167
BROADER BECAUSE AS WE LOOK AT

00:36:43.234 --> 00:36:46.571
THE CURRENT. SITUATION WITH

00:36:46.637 --> 00:36:49.840
CORNER VIRUS. IT WE WORK

00:36:49.907 --> 00:36:51.008
THROUGH OUR PARTNERS THE

00:36:51.075 --> 00:36:53.144
COUNTIES I JUST WOULD LOVE YOUR

00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:55.646
PERSPECTIVE OF EACH TIME

00:36:55.713 --> 00:36:56.881
SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS

00:36:56.948 --> 00:36:58.182
HOWEVER WE WORK IN BETTER AND

00:36:58.249 --> 00:36:59.483
BETTER WITH THE FIFTY EIGHT

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:00.718
COUNTIES IN THE PARTNERS WE ARE

00:37:00.785 --> 00:37:03.654
A BIG STATE. AND IT SEEMS A

00:37:03.721 --> 00:37:04.622
LITTLE FRIGHTENING TO ME THAT

00:37:04.689 --> 00:37:06.290
WE MIGHT HAVE TO COUNT ON FIFTY

00:37:06.357 --> 00:37:08.292
EIGHT COUNTIES ARE. WORKING

00:37:08.359 --> 00:37:10.027
WITH THE STATE DO YOU SEE AREAS

00:37:10.094 --> 00:37:12.530
WHERE WE NEED TO IMPROVE OUR

00:37:12.597 --> 00:37:13.931
SENATOR IN TERMS OF YOUR

00:37:13.998 --> 00:37:15.666
QUESTION AROUND THAT PARTICULAR

00:37:15.733 --> 00:37:16.867
SITUATION ON THE HEPATITIS

00:37:16.934 --> 00:37:18.836
OUTBREAK I THINK I'M THAT DID

00:37:18.903 --> 00:37:21.005
NOT GO OUT WELL AND I THINK WE

00:37:21.072 --> 00:37:22.373
LEARNED A LOT OF LESSONS WITH

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:23.841
REGARDS TO OUR ROLE AS A STATE

00:37:23.908 --> 00:37:25.443
AND OUR COUNTY PARTNERSHIP AND

00:37:25.509 --> 00:37:28.346
I THINK THAT. WHAT I WILL SAY

00:37:28.412 --> 00:37:29.680
THERE IS THAT I THINK WE NEED

00:37:29.747 --> 00:37:30.247
TO BE MUCH MORE PROACTIVE IN

00:37:30.314 --> 00:37:31.382
THERE OKAY INSTANCES WHERE WE

00:37:31.449 --> 00:37:32.883
MIGHT DISAGREE WITH THAT

00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:34.552
PARTICULAR COUNTY IN TERMS OF

00:37:34.619 --> 00:37:36.253
APPROACH AND THAT'S OKAY. I

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:37.488
THINK WE HAVE TO HAVE AN HONEST

00:37:37.555 --> 00:37:39.256
AND FRANK CONVERSATION AND WE

00:37:39.323 --> 00:37:41.926
NEED TO BE OPEN ABOUT IT AND- I

00:37:41.993 --> 00:37:44.128
THINK THAT AS WE CONTINUE TO

00:37:44.195 --> 00:37:45.796
LEARN FROM THESE INSTANCE SAYS.

00:37:45.863 --> 00:37:47.398
EVERY SINGLE SCENARIO IS

00:37:47.465 --> 00:37:48.899
DIFFERENT AND EVERY RESPONSE

00:37:48.966 --> 00:37:51.235
YIELDS A DIFFERENT RESPONSE AND

00:37:51.302 --> 00:37:52.737
I THINK PART OF IT IS MAKING

00:37:52.803 --> 00:37:53.838
SURE THAT WE HAVE A CLEAR

00:37:53.904 --> 00:37:54.872
UNDERSTANDING WHAT OUR ROLES

00:37:54.939 --> 00:37:56.707
AND AUTHORITIES ARE AND IN SOME

00:37:56.774 --> 00:37:59.110
INSTANCES A REQUIRE US GOING IN

00:37:59.176 --> 00:38:01.879
AND SAYING WE MIGHT HAVE A

00:38:01.946 --> 00:38:02.446
DISAGREEMENT AND WE NEED TO

00:38:02.513 --> 00:38:03.781
THINK ABOUT HOW WE- ELEVATE

00:38:03.848 --> 00:38:05.950
THAT IN THE STATE TAKING A MORE

00:38:06.017 --> 00:38:06.550
PROMINENT ROLE IN A PARTICULAR

00:38:06.617 --> 00:38:09.220
COMMUNITY- I. THINK THAT WE

00:38:09.286 --> 00:38:10.755
LEARNED A LOT FROM THAT AUDIT

00:38:10.821 --> 00:38:12.490
FINDING IN TERMS OF SAN DIEGO

00:38:12.556 --> 00:38:14.659
IN PARTICULAR. AND I THINK THAT

00:38:14.725 --> 00:38:15.760
THE DEPARTMENT IS DOING A LOT

00:38:15.826 --> 00:38:17.428
IN ORDER TO THINKING ABOUT HOW

00:38:17.495 --> 00:38:19.430
TO BE MORE REALISTICALLY

00:38:19.497 --> 00:38:22.633
RESPONSE SOME OF THESE PIECES

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:26.237
IT'S NOT ALTHOUGH EVERY CAN IN

00:38:26.303 --> 00:38:30.708
A BE FOR. BRUCE TO BE SPENT

00:38:30.775 --> 00:38:34.545
THERE ARE PLUS THAT WE HAVE OUR

00:38:34.612 --> 00:38:36.313
JOB. TO I'M SO. I HOPE I

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:37.314
ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION BUT I

00:38:37.381 --> 00:38:38.315
THINK THERE'S A LOT THAT WE

00:38:38.382 --> 00:38:39.817
LEARNED FROM THAT EXPERIENCE IN

00:38:39.884 --> 00:38:41.719
SAN DIEGO. IN IT I MEAN I THINK

00:38:41.786 --> 00:38:43.054
FOR ME AND PROBABLY FOR MY

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:44.755
COLLEAGUES ALL OVER THE STATE

00:38:44.822 --> 00:38:46.257
WHEN THERE IS A SITUATION LIKE

00:38:46.323 --> 00:38:48.159
THAT. AND WE MAY HAVE CONCERNS

00:38:48.225 --> 00:38:49.827
ABOUT HOW ARE COUNTY MIGHT BE

00:38:49.894 --> 00:38:50.761
ACTING WE'RE NOT I'M NOT A

00:38:50.828 --> 00:38:53.130
PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERT BY ANY

00:38:53.197 --> 00:38:56.834
STRETCH. YOU KNOW. I THINK I

00:38:56.901 --> 00:38:58.002
WANT TO KNOW WHEN CAN THE STATE

00:38:58.069 --> 00:39:02.106
STEP IN AND TAKE A OVER RIDE-

00:39:02.173 --> 00:39:03.474
AND AS LONG AS YOU HAVE A

00:39:03.541 --> 00:39:05.176
SYSTEM WHERE YOU. FEEL LIKE YOU

00:39:05.242 --> 00:39:06.944
GET THE ABILITY TO EVALUATE A

00:39:07.011 --> 00:39:09.380
SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES. MAKE A

00:39:09.447 --> 00:39:11.515
DETERMINATION AND DECIDE.

00:39:11.582 --> 00:39:12.917
WHETHER IT IS IN THE OVER

00:39:12.983 --> 00:39:15.419
ARCHING- INTEREST FOR STATE

00:39:15.486 --> 00:39:18.122
PUBLIC HEALTH. FOR THE STATE TO

00:39:18.189 --> 00:39:20.658
ACTUALLY. STEP IN AND DO WE

00:39:20.725 --> 00:39:21.459
HAVE REALLY THE ABILITY TO DO

00:39:21.525 --> 00:39:24.195
THAT. I THINK WE DO AND I THINK

00:39:24.261 --> 00:39:25.730
THAT IT WILL ALWAYS DEPEND ON

00:39:25.796 --> 00:39:26.997
THE CIRCUMSTANCE LET ME PUT IT

00:39:27.064 --> 00:39:29.100
THAT WAY- AND TO THE EXTENT

00:39:29.166 --> 00:39:30.234
THAT WE CAN BUILD CONSENSUS

00:39:30.301 --> 00:39:31.268
WITH OUR LOCAL PARTNERS THAT'S

00:39:31.335 --> 00:39:33.170
THE- THE FIRST THING WE NEED TO

00:39:33.237 --> 00:39:34.872
STRIVE FOR. FIRST AND FOREMOST

00:39:35.773 --> 00:39:37.475
DIFFERENCES IN AND AT LEAST IN

00:39:37.541 --> 00:39:38.676

STATE LEVEL IN ORDER TO ENSURE

00:39:44.815 --> 00:39:46.317
THAT. WE ARE AT LEAST

ON WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE AND HOW

00:40:49.246 --> 00:40:51.215
YOU'RE- UNDERTAKING- THE

00:40:51.282 --> 00:40:52.416
CONVERSATION AS WE COME

00:40:52.483 --> 00:40:54.418
TOGETHER TO TRY TO. SUPPORT THE

00:40:54.485 --> 00:40:57.488
RESOURCES BUT MAKE SURE. THAT I

00:40:57.555 --> 00:40:59.256
THEY WILL BE USED EFFECTIVELY

00:40:59.323 --> 00:41:00.891
WORKING WITH THOSE SAME

00:41:00.958 --> 00:41:02.593
PARTNERS IN MANY CASES AND

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:04.762
OTHERS. SO I THINK SENATOR IT'S

00:41:04.829 --> 00:41:05.663
A GREAT QUESTION AND I'M

00:41:05.729 --> 00:41:07.832
GRATEFUL TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR

00:41:07.898 --> 00:41:08.866
AT LEAST THE PAST TWO YEARS

00:41:08.933 --> 00:41:10.134
WE'VE MADE SOME SIGNIFICANT

00:41:10.201 --> 00:41:11.235
INVESTMENTS IN THE ISSUE OF

00:41:11.302 --> 00:41:13.137
HOMELESSNESS. I THINK IT IS

00:41:13.204 --> 00:41:15.573
STILL A CRISIS AND I THINK IT

00:41:15.639 --> 00:41:17.174
JUST POINTS TO. THE GOVERNOR'S

00:41:17.241 --> 00:41:17.875
COMMITMENT ON THIS BY

00:41:17.942 --> 00:41:19.577
DEDICATING HIS ENTIRE STATE OF

00:41:19.643 --> 00:41:20.644
THE STATE ADDRESS TO THIS

00:41:20.711 --> 00:41:22.813
PARTICULAR TOPIC- IN TERMS OF

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:24.114
THE BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT WE

00:41:24.181 --> 00:41:26.250
HAVE BEFORE YOU- WE'RE LOOKING

00:41:26.317 --> 00:41:27.718
TO CREATE A CALIFORNIA ACCESS

00:41:27.785 --> 00:41:28.919
TO HOUSING SERVICES FUND WITH

00:41:28.986 --> 00:41:31.088
THE IDEA THAT WE INVEST SEVEN

00:41:31.155 --> 00:41:32.790
HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS.

00:41:32.857 --> 00:41:34.692
AND BUILD ON TOP OF THAT WITH

00:41:34.758 --> 00:41:36.060
PHILANTHROPIC AND PRIVATE

00:41:36.126 --> 00:41:39.563
SECTOR DOLLARS- I THINK. WE'RE

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:40.664
TRYING TO DO HERE IS A LOOK AT

00:41:40.731 --> 00:41:43.367
HOW WE DISRUPT THIS ISSUE. AND

00:41:43.434 --> 00:41:44.969
PERHAPS A DIFFERENT WAY THAT WE

00:41:45.035 --> 00:41:46.370
HAVE TODAY. AND IN MY

00:41:46.437 --> 00:41:48.072
CONVERSATION CENTER BATES IN

00:41:48.138 --> 00:41:51.041
PARTICULAR I THINK IT COMES

00:41:51.108 --> 00:41:52.309
DOWN TO THE CATERPILLAR DE THAT.

00:41:52.376 --> 00:41:53.911
THE OUTCOMES WANT TO BE ABLE TO

00:41:53.978 --> 00:41:55.613
HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO PARTICULAR

00:41:55.679 --> 00:41:57.014
OUTCOMES THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE

00:41:57.081 --> 00:41:59.650
WITH THESE DOLLARS TEN PART OF

00:41:59.717 --> 00:42:00.985
IT TOO IS THAT- PUBLISHED IT

00:42:01.051 --> 00:42:02.786
DOES NOT. ISOLATED TO ONE

00:42:02.853 --> 00:42:05.155
PARTICULAR. AREA OF WHETHER

00:42:05.222 --> 00:42:08.893
THAT'S A GEOGRAPHIC CITY OR CAN

00:42:08.959 --> 00:42:11.829
BE. FACT MOVES ACROSS CAP LINES

00:42:11.896 --> 00:42:14.932
ANY. SAYS SO. THERE NOT ALL THE

00:42:14.999 --> 00:42:18.569
TRYING PRESENT TO. IS LOOK AT

00:42:18.636 --> 00:42:19.870
HOW DO WE JUST THIS PROCESS. IN

00:42:19.937 --> 00:42:21.138
ORDER PRIVATE OUT MEANS THE

00:42:21.205 --> 00:42:21.739
ONLY OTHER THING I WAS IS THAT

00:42:21.805 --> 00:42:23.274
GOV CANNOT SOLVE THE ALONE. IN

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:24.341
PART OF THE IDEA BE. REALLY

00:42:24.408 --> 00:42:26.043
LOOK AT CREE THIS FIND. AND

00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:27.544
ALLOWING PHILANTHROPY AND

00:42:27.611 --> 00:42:28.679
PRIVATE SECTOR TO COME TO THE

00:42:28.746 --> 00:42:30.514
TABLE IS TO REALLY CREATIVELY

00:42:30.581 --> 00:42:31.715
THINK ABOUT HOW WE YES

00:42:31.782 --> 00:42:33.684
CALIFORNIANS TOGETHER. TO TRY

00:42:33.751 --> 00:42:34.952
TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEMFOR THE

00:42:35.019 --> 00:42:36.553
NEIGHBORS THAT WE WALK BY I

00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:37.755
MEAN THIS AFTERNOON ON MY WAY

00:42:37.821 --> 00:42:39.290
INTO THE CAPITAL. I DID WALK BY

00:42:39.356 --> 00:42:40.524
A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE

00:42:40.591 --> 00:42:41.792
SITTING ON THE STREET. AND I

00:42:41.859 --> 00:42:43.494
THINK WE MUST DO BETTER FOR

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:45.062
THEM WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HOW

00:42:45.129 --> 00:42:47.197
WE NOT IN SHOULD ONLY ENSURE.

00:42:47.264 --> 00:42:48.832
THAT WE GIVE THEM HOUSING BUT

00:42:48.899 --> 00:42:50.234
THAT WE WRAP THEM AROUND WITH

00:42:50.301 --> 00:42:51.568
THE APPROPRIATE SERVICES SAID

00:42:51.635 --> 00:42:52.670
THAT WE ADDRESS THEIR MENTAL

00:42:52.736 --> 00:42:53.871
HEALTH OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE SO

00:42:53.938 --> 00:42:55.906
THAT THEY CAN STAY HOUSE. IT

00:42:55.973 --> 00:42:57.508
DOESN'T DO THEM ANY GOOD TO

00:42:57.574 --> 00:42:59.343
JUST GIVE THEM A PLACE TO GO

00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:00.811
WITHOUT REALLY ADDRESSING THEIR

00:43:00.878 --> 00:43:02.746
UNDERLYING NEEDS SIMILARLY FOR

00:43:02.813 --> 00:43:03.814
THOSE INDIVIDUALS FOR ON THE

00:43:03.881 --> 00:43:05.516
BRINK OF HOMELESSNESS. THINKING

00:43:05.582 --> 00:43:06.951
ABOUT HOW DO WE WRAP OURSELVES

00:43:07.017 --> 00:43:08.519
AROUND THEM TO THINK ABOUT THE

00:43:08.585 --> 00:43:09.520
MENTAL HEALTH OR SUBSTANCE USE

00:43:09.586 --> 00:43:10.854
DISORDERS THAT THEY'RE DEALING

00:43:10.921 --> 00:43:12.122
WITH. SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY

00:43:12.189 --> 00:43:14.558
KEEP THEM HOUSE AND SO. MY HOPE

00:43:14.625 --> 00:43:15.526
