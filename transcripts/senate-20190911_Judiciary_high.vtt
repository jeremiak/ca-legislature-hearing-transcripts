00:10:53.619 --> 00:10:56.122
CHAIR WOMEN THIS IS TRACY KENNY

00:10:56.188 --> 00:10:58.057
I'M AN ATTORNEY WITH THE

00:10:58.124 --> 00:10:58.824
JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND I ACTUALLY

00:10:58.891 --> 00:11:00.126
HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF STAFFING

00:11:00.192 --> 00:11:01.927
THE FAMILY AND YOU CAN A LOT

00:11:01.994 --> 00:11:02.828
VICE RE COMMITTEE FOR THE

00:11:02.895 --> 00:11:05.364
JUDICIAL COUNCIL WHICH WOULD BE

00:11:05.431 --> 00:11:06.732
CHARGED WITH IMPLEMENTING THIS

00:11:06.799 --> 00:11:08.334
LEGISLATION WERE TO BE ENACTED

00:11:08.401 --> 00:11:11.203
SO I JUST WANT TO SHARE SOME OF

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:11.871
THE CONCERNS ABOUT COMMITTEE

00:11:11.937 --> 00:11:13.272
HAD ABOUT HOW WE WOULD GO ABOUT

00:11:13.339 --> 00:11:14.273
IT I MEAN THIS THIS NATION

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.142
BECAUSE WE DON'T THINK THAT IS

00:11:16.208 --> 00:11:16.909
READY. TO GO FOR IN THE WAY

00:11:16.976 --> 00:11:18.511
THAT WE DON'T EVEN SURE HOW TO

00:11:18.577 --> 00:11:19.645
IMPLEMENT SOME OF IT BECAUSE OF

00:11:19.712 --> 00:11:21.514
THE AMBIGUITIES WE ALSO THINK

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:22.214
THERE WOULD BE SERIOUS

00:11:22.281 --> 00:11:23.983
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IF IT

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:26.085
WERE TO BE ENACTED IN THIS FORM

00:11:26.152 --> 00:11:28.354
AND IT IS NOT THAT WE DON'T.

00:11:28.421 --> 00:11:29.355
TAKE THESE ISSUES VERY

00:11:29.422 --> 00:11:30.923
SERIOUSLY THIS IS A COMMITTEE

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:34.760
THAT CHAIRED BY TWO VERY FOLKS

00:11:34.827 --> 00:11:35.494
WERE VERY INTERESTED IN

00:11:35.561 --> 00:11:37.063
ENSURING THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

00:11:37.129 --> 00:11:38.597
VICTIMS ARE PROTECTED THAT OUR

00:11:38.664 --> 00:11:39.565
ORDERS ARE IN FORCE WE THINK

00:11:39.632 --> 00:11:42.334
THAT IS AT LAUDABLE GOAL AND

00:11:42.401 --> 00:11:43.736
ONE THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SIT

00:11:43.803 --> 00:11:45.838
DOWN WITH OTHER STAKEHOLDERS

00:11:45.905 --> 00:11:46.472
AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT THE MOST

00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:48.474
EFFECTIVE MEANS TO DO THAT. IN

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:50.543
A TIME PERIOD THAT ALLOWS US TO

00:11:50.609 --> 00:11:51.811
GET THE DETAILS RIGHT BECAUSE

00:11:51.877 --> 00:11:55.081
THESE ARE COURTS THAT HAVE VERY

00:11:55.147 --> 00:11:56.182
HIGH VOLUMES AND THERE ARE A

00:11:56.248 --> 00:11:57.550
LOT OF PEOPLE SEEKING

00:11:57.616 --> 00:12:01.020
PROTECTION AND IF WE ADD A HUGE

00:12:01.087 --> 00:12:02.521
VOLUME OF NEW HEARINGS AND TO

00:12:02.588 --> 00:12:04.890
PROTECT NO ONE EVEN SHOWS UP

00:12:04.957 --> 00:12:08.494
BECAUSE. THE SERVICE

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:09.061
DEPARTMENTS ARE VERY VERY TO

00:12:09.128 --> 00:12:13.732
EMAIL SIR. IN THE STRAIN PERSON

00:12:13.799 --> 00:12:14.533
NOT EVEN GETTING SERVICE OF THE

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.134
HEARING. SO YOU HAVE A REVIEW

00:12:15.201 --> 00:12:15.734
HEARING ON FIREARMS WHICH YOU

00:12:15.801 --> 00:12:16.368
HAVE VERY LITTLE INFORMATION SO

00:12:16.435 --> 00:12:16.936
FOR EXAMPLE. WHEN A PERSON

00:12:17.002 --> 00:12:17.603
SEEKS A PROTECTIVE ORDER. THEY

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:18.637
THERE IS A QUESTION ON THAT

00:12:18.704 --> 00:12:19.205
TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER

00:12:19.271 --> 00:12:20.506
REQUEST FORM DO DOES THAT DO

00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:21.507
YOU THINK THAT THE RESTRAINT

00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:22.842
PERSON HAS A GUN. AND YOU SAY

00:12:22.908 --> 00:12:25.244
YES NO OR I DON'T KNOW SO THE

00:12:25.311 --> 00:12:26.278
COURT MAY HAVE A FORM THAT HAS

00:12:26.345 --> 00:12:27.613
A CHECK BOX I DON'T KNOW THAT'S

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.081
THIS. EVIDENCE THAT THE COURT

00:12:29.148 --> 00:12:31.016
HAS TO MAKE THESE SPECIFIC AND

00:12:31.083 --> 00:12:32.051
DETAILED FINDINGS OF FACT THAT

00:12:32.118 --> 00:12:33.686
ARE REQUIRED BY THIS PROPOSED

00:12:33.752 --> 00:12:35.121
LEGISLATION. I'M NOT EVEN SURE

00:12:35.187 --> 00:12:37.490
WHAT. ON THE REVISED FORM FOR

00:12:37.556 --> 00:12:38.524
THE COURT TO THEN TRY TO

00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:40.593
DETERMINE DO THEY HAVE A GUN OR

00:12:40.659 --> 00:12:41.994
NOT DO THEY MAKE A FINDING THAT

00:12:42.061 --> 00:12:42.895
THEY HAVE A GUN OR NOT MAKE A

00:12:42.962 --> 00:12:43.562
FINDING THAT THEY HAVE A GUN TO

00:12:43.629 --> 00:12:44.830
THEY SAID A REVIEW HEARING THE-

00:12:44.897 --> 00:12:47.233
CASE. IS IT IN TWO DAYS AND IF.

00:12:47.299 --> 00:12:48.100
NO ONE SHOWS UP THAT REVIEW

00:12:48.167 --> 00:12:49.301
HEARING WHAT IS THE COURT

00:12:49.368 --> 00:12:50.603
EXPECTED TO DO. THEIR

00:12:50.669 --> 00:12:52.171
REQUIREMENTS TO COMMUNICATE

00:12:52.238 --> 00:12:53.472
WITH THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:12:53.539 --> 00:12:55.274
AGENCY WITH JURISDICTION OVER

00:12:55.341 --> 00:12:56.842
THE RESTRAINT PERSON. I'M NOT

00:12:56.909 --> 00:12:58.477
SURE WHAT THAT MEANS WHICH IS

00:12:58.544 --> 00:13:01.580
THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:13:01.647 --> 00:13:02.181
AGENCY WITH JURISDICTION OVER

00:13:02.248 --> 00:13:05.751
ME OR YOU HOW IS THE CORTES.

00:13:05.818 --> 00:13:06.785
THAT IS WHO IN THAT ENTITY. IS

00:13:06.852 --> 00:13:07.620
THE COURT TO COMMUNICATE WITH

00:13:07.686 --> 00:13:08.087
THAT'S NOT SPECIFIED.

00:13:08.154 --> 00:13:08.721
LEGISLATION BUT- FUNDAMENTALLY

00:13:08.787 --> 00:13:09.989
I THINK THAT IN TERMS OF

00:13:10.055 --> 00:13:11.323
GETTING. GUNS FROM RESTRAIN

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:13.459
PARTIES WE HAVE AN INCREDIBLY.

00:13:13.526 --> 00:13:15.294
GREAT MODEL IN SAN MATEO COUNTY

00:13:15.361 --> 00:13:17.029
THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE.

00:13:17.096 --> 00:13:18.998
EXPANDED TO MORE OF THE STATE

00:13:19.064 --> 00:13:20.966
WHERE THEY'RE SHERIFF'S OFFICE.

00:13:21.033 --> 00:13:21.433
LOOKS AT ALL OF THESE

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:22.868
RESTRAINING ORDERS AS THEY COME

00:13:22.935 --> 00:13:24.803
IN AND- ANY. ONE WHERE IT SAYS.

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:26.772
YES OR EVEN I DON'T KNOW

00:13:26.839 --> 00:13:28.474
THEY'RE CALLING. THE RESTRAINED

00:13:28.541 --> 00:13:29.708
PARTY THEY'RE CHECKING UP ON

00:13:29.775 --> 00:13:30.643
THM THEY'RE CHECKING THE

00:13:30.709 --> 00:13:31.544
DATABASE IS TO SEE IF THEY'RE

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:32.845
REGISTERED FIREARMS AND THEY

00:13:32.912 --> 00:13:34.446
ARE. GETTING THE SURRENDER OF

00:13:34.513 --> 00:13:36.615
MANY MANY MANY FIRE I THINK

00:13:36.682 --> 00:13:37.683
THIS IS THE WAY TO PROTECT

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:40.419
PEOPLE. NOT TO UP LOAD OUR

00:13:40.486 --> 00:13:41.420
COURT COUNT THANK YOU FOR YOUR-

00:13:41.487 --> 00:13:42.855
TESTIMONY AND I THINK THAT. MAY

00:13:42.922 --> 00:13:46.659
GIVE US SOME. GUIDANCE GOING

00:13:46.725 --> 00:13:47.193
FORWARD THANK YOU FOR YOUR

00:13:47.259 --> 00:13:51.931
TESTIMONY NEXT WITNESS. OUR

00:13:51.997 --> 00:13:53.098
COMMENTS REALLY ALIGNED WITH

00:13:53.165 --> 00:13:55.034
THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL SO I'LL

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:58.170
KEEP MY TESTIMONY BRIEF. BUT AS

00:13:58.237 --> 00:13:59.772
WAS SAID FIRST AND FOREMOST WE

00:13:59.838 --> 00:14:01.807
WANT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT

00:14:01.874 --> 00:14:02.942
THE RELINQUISHMENT OF FIREARMS

00:14:03.008 --> 00:14:05.244
BY RESTRAIN PERSONS. IS A

00:14:05.311 --> 00:14:06.745
SHOULD BE A PRIORITY AND THE

00:14:06.812 --> 00:14:08.914
COURTS PLAY A BIG ROLE IN THAT.

00:14:08.981 --> 00:14:10.149
BUT WE NEED A THOUGHTFUL

00:14:10.216 --> 00:14:13.118
SOLUTION AND AS WRITTEN AB FOR

00:14:13.185 --> 00:14:15.387
SIXTY FIVE IS NOT THAT. AB FOR

00:14:15.454 --> 00:14:18.157
SIXTY FIVE YEAR HAS TOO MANY

00:14:18.224 --> 00:14:18.757
TEETH BECAUSE OF SEPARATION OF

00:14:18.824 --> 00:14:20.693
POWER ISSUES. BRAILLE MEANT

00:14:20.759 --> 00:14:23.529
ISSUES AND DUE PROCESS CONCERNS

00:14:23.596 --> 00:14:24.763
OR NOT ENOUGH TEETH BECAUSE

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:26.398
THERE'S NO BENCH WARRANTS NO

00:14:26.465 --> 00:14:28.634
EXPLICIT CONTENT AND NO DUTY OF

00:14:28.701 --> 00:14:30.836
LAW ENFORCEMENT TO INVESTIGATE.

00:14:30.903 --> 00:14:31.804
BECAUSE OF THE LAST MINUTE

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:33.939
CONSIDERATION THIS BILL MANY

00:14:34.006 --> 00:14:35.074
QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED BUT

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:37.476
NO ANSWERS PROVIDED AN AS THE

00:14:37.543 --> 00:14:38.510
JUDICIAL COUNCIL JUST BROUGHT

00:14:38.577 --> 00:14:40.646
UP ONE SUCH SUCH QUESTION IS

00:14:40.713 --> 00:14:43.082
WILL THIS BILL ACTUALLY RESULT

00:14:43.148 --> 00:14:44.750
IN MUCH MORE GUN RELINQUISH

00:14:44.817 --> 00:14:46.385
MINUTES. THE DISCUSSION THAT

00:14:46.452 --> 00:14:48.320
WE'RE HAVING IS A WORTHY ONE

00:14:48.387 --> 00:14:50.956
AND ONE THAT CJ'S NOT ONLY

00:14:51.023 --> 00:14:52.458
WILLING TO ENGAGE IN BUT IS

00:14:52.524 --> 00:14:54.793
EAGER TO ENGAGE IN IN THE FALL

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:56.095
SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A MORE

00:14:56.161 --> 00:14:58.464

ASSOCIATED WITH THE

00:15:14.213 --> 00:15:16.615
IMPLEMENTATION I AM THOSE

00:15:16.682 --> 00:15:18.050
STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT WE

00:15:18.117 --> 00:15:20.085
REALLY DO NEED TO START

00:15:20.152 --> 00:15:22.421
ADDRESSING THIS PROBLEM I KNOW

00:15:22.488 --> 00:15:23.722
HAVING. LISTENED THIS MORNING

00:15:23.789 --> 00:15:25.791

00:15:25.858 --> 00:15:29.428
STORY ABOUT. THE INDIVIDUALS

PRIMARILY WOMEN BUT NOT

00:15:30.696 --> 00:15:32.831

EITHER WITNESSED OR BEEN

00:15:37.069 --> 00:15:40.039
MURDERED AS WELL. AND I HAD A

00:15:40.105 --> 00:15:41.774
SIMILAR SITUATION IN MY OWN

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.342
DISTRICT THE NUMBER YEARS AGO

00:15:43.409 --> 00:15:44.476
FOR WHICH I THEN BROUGHT

00:15:44.543 --> 00:15:46.312
LEGISLATION THIS IS A PROBLEM

00:15:46.378 --> 00:15:50.616
THAT SEEMS TO KEEP GROWING. AND

00:15:50.683 --> 00:15:54.053
HI HAVE DISCUSSES SO WITH THE

00:15:54.119 --> 00:15:54.720

SUSPECT THAT IT'S ONE THAT WE

00:16:03.462 --> 00:16:07.566

00:16:20.379 --> 00:16:24.917
I KNOW THEY WILL DO A- VERY

00:16:24.983 --> 00:16:25.517
COMPREHENSIVE EFFORT TO BRING

00:16:25.584 --> 00:16:30.189
THIS. MATTER TO SOME KIND OF A

00:16:30.255 --> 00:16:31.090
DOABLE PROCESS AND- BEING THE

00:16:31.156 --> 00:16:32.291
SPOUSE OF A RETIRED JUDGE HE

00:16:32.358 --> 00:16:34.360
SAID ON THE CGA I. UNDERSTAND

00:16:34.426 --> 00:16:35.894
THE CONCERNS ASSOCIATED WITH

00:16:35.961 --> 00:16:38.097
THE COURTS WHO ARE CLEARLY

00:16:38.163 --> 00:16:38.664
OVERWHELMED PARTICULARLY IN

00:16:38.731 --> 00:16:42.101
FAMILY LAW. THERE MAY BE SOME

00:16:42.167 --> 00:16:43.502
OTHER WAYS WE CAN DO THIS I

00:16:43.569 --> 00:16:46.638
KEEP THINKING. YOU KNOW. THE

00:16:46.705 --> 00:16:47.439
PRIVATE SECTOR KNOWS JUST ABOUT

00:16:47.506 --> 00:16:50.275
EVERYTHING ABOUT US. WHY CAN'T

00:16:50.342 --> 00:16:51.944
WE IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR IN THE

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:54.813
PUBLIC SAFETY SECTOR HAVE OF

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:56.482
THE KIND OF SYSTEMS IN PLACE

00:16:56.548 --> 00:16:59.017
WHERE A COURT CAN ISSUE A

00:16:59.084 --> 00:17:00.419
RESTRAINING ORDER I'M THINKING

00:17:00.486 --> 00:17:01.820
YOU DON'T. YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE

00:17:01.887 --> 00:17:03.255
TO KNOW THAT A PERSON HAS A

00:17:03.322 --> 00:17:04.723
REAL HAS A GUN YOU JUST SIMPLY

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:06.859
SAY. A RESTRAINING ORDERS BEEN

00:17:06.925 --> 00:17:08.861
ISSUED IF THIS PERSON HAS FIRE

00:17:08.927 --> 00:17:10.863
ARMS THEY MUST BE RELINQUISHED

00:17:10.929 --> 00:17:13.031
HE GOES TO LAW ENFORCEMENT THEY

00:17:13.098 --> 00:17:14.333
CHECK IF THE APP SYSTEMS

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.602

00:17:16.668 --> 00:17:17.169
THEY COULD FIND IT OUT IN A

00:17:17.236 --> 00:17:19.772
HEART BEAT. THEY COULD HAVE A

SURE THOSE GUNS WERE. ROUTE

RELINQUISHED MEAN THAT THIS

00:17:29.381 --> 00:17:30.816

OUR- OUR MINDS TO IT AND

00:17:33.452 --> 00:17:34.720

THE STAFF ANALYSIS THAT GOES ON

00:18:03.449 --> 00:18:04.950
BECAUSE WE TALK ABOUT

TWO DAYS TO. GET RID OF ALL

00:18:28.907 --> 00:18:32.444

THAT PROBLEM. I NOTICED. THAT

00:18:37.983 --> 00:18:39.218

WOULD TAKES OFFENSE AT THIS

00:18:42.654 --> 00:18:43.489
HASN'T BEEN A THOUGHTFUL

00:18:43.555 --> 00:18:44.756
APPROACH I THINK IT'S BEEN A

00:18:44.823 --> 00:18:46.525
TOUGH APPROACH AND IT COMES

00:18:46.592 --> 00:18:48.894
WITH SOME URGENCY AND I HAVE

00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:50.195
CERTAINLY SAID THAT WE WILL

00:18:50.262 --> 00:18:51.997
CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS INTO

00:18:52.064 --> 00:18:53.198
WE CAN GET ALL THE ISSUES

00:18:53.265 --> 00:18:55.133
RESOLVED TO TAKE IT FORWARD I

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.768
DON'T THINK. ANYBODY ARGUES

00:18:56.835 --> 00:19:00.405
pCOMMUTING ABUSE TO BE ABLE TO

KEEP THEIR GUNS BUT I

00:19:01.573 --> 00:19:03.509
UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE THAT IT

00:19:03.575 --> 00:19:04.877
WOULD BE HARD THEN TO NOTICE

00:19:04.943 --> 00:19:05.744
THEM TO HAVE THAT PROCESS IN

00:19:05.811 --> 00:19:08.313
PLACE SO YEAH IT'S THE IT'S THE

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.415
DUE PROCESS YOU KNOW THEY THEY

00:19:10.482 --> 00:19:11.917
MAY BE BAD ACTORS THEY MAY BE

00:19:11.984 --> 00:19:13.986
VIOLENT THEY MAY HAVE

00:19:14.052 --> 00:19:15.821
UNREGISTERED ALL THAT MAY BE

00:19:15.888 --> 00:19:17.422
TRUE BUT THE LEAPS WHEN WE DO

00:19:17.489 --> 00:19:19.157
BILLS WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:19:19.224 --> 00:19:21.093
BACKSTOPS IS THE DUE PROCESS

00:19:21.159 --> 00:19:23.562
WERE FINE WE'VE ALL TRAINED IN

00:19:23.629 --> 00:19:25.831
IN THE LAW TO SAY YOU GIVE THAT

00:19:25.898 --> 00:19:28.734
PERSON NOTICE BEFORE THEIR CORE

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:30.235
INCLUDE IN VIOLATION OF THIS

00:19:30.302 --> 00:19:32.604
NEW STATUTES. FOR JUST PROCESS

00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:33.839
NOT THAT I MEAN MAYBE THE

00:19:33.906 --> 00:19:36.041
INCIDENT YOU HAVE YOUR WITNESS

00:19:36.108 --> 00:19:37.342
WILL TELL HAS SAID HERE THAT

00:19:37.409 --> 00:19:40.045
THERE'S INCIDENTS OF A 5100%

00:19:40.112 --> 00:19:42.014
INCREASE IN MURDERS AND

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:49.087
VIOLENCE I GOT THAT I GOT. THAT

00:19:49.154 --> 00:19:49.621
BUT STILL WE'RE A STATE OF

00:19:49.688 --> 00:19:55.027
RULES. RULES THAT HAVE FALLEN.

00:19:55.093 --> 00:19:55.661
CENTER I DON'T THINK THAT AND I

00:19:55.727 --> 00:19:56.194
TOTALLY AGREE AND WE HAVE

00:19:56.261 --> 00:19:56.862
FOUGHT VERY HARD IN THIS

00:19:56.929 --> 00:19:57.729
COMMITTEE TO MAKE SURE DUE

00:19:57.796 --> 00:19:58.497
PROCESS AND NOTICE AND ALL

00:19:58.564 --> 00:19:58.897
THOSE FUNDAMENTAL.

00:19:58.964 --> 00:19:59.398
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO

00:19:59.464 --> 00:20:00.766
MAINTAIN. I DON'T THINK THAT

00:20:00.832 --> 00:20:02.968
THE- JUDGES AND THAT THE-

00:20:03.035 --> 00:20:06.405
JUDICIAL COUNCIL. WOULD ALLOW.

00:20:06.471 --> 00:20:09.942
ANY KIND OF. SEATING WITHOUT

00:20:10.008 --> 00:20:11.376
THAT INHERENT TO PROCESS THAT'S

00:20:11.443 --> 00:20:13.045
THE WE'VE SORT OF GOT A ROAD

00:20:13.111 --> 00:20:15.213
MAP HERE AND THE SUGGESTION AND

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:16.348
I KNOW HAVING TALKED TO THE

00:20:16.415 --> 00:20:17.716
ASSEMBLY MEMBER SHE WILL

00:20:17.783 --> 00:20:20.218
CONTINUE TO FILL THE SAN. WITH

00:20:20.285 --> 00:20:21.820
THE ASSISTANCE AND I AND I

00:20:21.887 --> 00:20:23.622
THINK THERE IS A DESIRE TO

00:20:23.689 --> 00:20:28.660
COLLABORATE WITH THE COURTS AND

00:20:28.727 --> 00:20:30.629
IS A FRAMEWORK. AND I DON'T

00:20:30.696 --> 00:20:31.964
THINK FRANKLY THERE'S A CORD

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:35.167
THAT I CAN THINK OF THAT WOULD

00:20:35.233 --> 00:20:35.667
FIND SOMEONE IN CRIMINAL

00:20:35.734 --> 00:20:38.770
CONTEMPT OR WOULD WOULD. HAVE

00:20:38.837 --> 00:20:40.138
ANY KIND OF CRIMINAL OR EVEN.

00:20:40.205 --> 00:20:42.374
IN A CIVIL CASE OF COURT ANY

00:20:42.441 --> 00:20:43.375
KIND OF CONSEQUENCE WITHOUT

00:20:43.442 --> 00:20:44.977
THAT NOTICE REQUIREMENT THAT

00:20:45.043 --> 00:20:46.244
JUST A FUNDAMENTAL

00:20:46.311 --> 00:20:48.513
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. SO IT'S-

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:50.315
ARE YOU COULD ARGUE I THINK

00:20:50.382 --> 00:20:51.316
THAT IT'S IMPLICIT IN THIS

00:20:51.383 --> 00:20:52.985
BECAUSE IT IS SO FUNDAMENTAL

00:20:53.051 --> 00:20:55.020
BUT CERTAINLY WORKING ON THIS

00:20:55.087 --> 00:20:56.788
GOING FORWARD. TO MAKE IT AS

00:20:56.855 --> 00:20:59.458
CLEAR AS POSSIBLE I THINK IS

00:20:59.524 --> 00:20:59.992
SOMETHING THAT'S SORT OF A

00:21:00.058 --> 00:21:00.492
FUNDAMENTAL PART OF THIS

00:21:00.559 --> 00:21:02.027
DISCUSSION. SO HOW WOULD THAT

00:21:02.094 --> 00:21:05.931
HAPPEN. IF I CAN JUST POP IN TO

00:21:05.998 --> 00:21:08.300
TRY TO HELP CLARIFY OKAY. HEAR

00:21:08.367 --> 00:21:11.503
ME I'M I THE INTENTION I

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:12.738
BELIEVE BEHIND THE LANGUAGE IS

00:21:12.804 --> 00:21:15.273
NOT TO FIND SOMEBODY IN

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:16.642
VIOLATION BEFORE THEY'VE

00:21:16.708 --> 00:21:18.043
RECEIVED NOTICE BUT THE

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:20.312
EXISTING RULES ALREADY ABOUT

00:21:20.379 --> 00:21:21.513
FIREARM RELINQUISHMENT.

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:23.148
DIRECTOR THAT ONCE A RESTRAINED

00:21:23.215 --> 00:21:25.083
PERSON HAS BEEN SERVED WITH THE

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:26.084
TEMPORARY ORDER SO THEY'VE BEEN

00:21:26.151 --> 00:21:27.986
GIVEN NOTICE THAT IS WHEN THEY

00:21:28.053 --> 00:21:29.287
HAVE TWENTY FOUR HOURS TO

00:21:29.354 --> 00:21:31.056
RELINQUISH THEIR FIREARMS IN

00:21:31.123 --> 00:21:32.724
FORTY EIGHT HOURS. TO FILE A

00:21:32.791 --> 00:21:34.526
FORM AND USUALCOUNSEL WITH THE

00:21:34.593 --> 00:21:36.395
FORM CONFIRMING THAT THEY HAVE

00:21:36.461 --> 00:21:37.295
DONE SO THAT THEY HAVE COMPLIED

00:21:37.362 --> 00:21:42.434
WITH THAT RULE SO WE'RE NOT THE

00:21:42.501 --> 00:21:43.301
INTENTION BEHIND THIS IS NOT.

00:21:43.368 --> 00:21:46.638
TO HOPE SOMEBODY YOU KNOW IN

00:21:46.705 --> 00:21:47.539
CONTEMPT OF A COURT ORDER WHEN

00:21:47.606 --> 00:21:48.640
THEY'RE NOT AWARE OF THAT COURT

00:21:48.707 --> 00:21:49.741
ORDER. AS MENTOR POINTED OUT

00:21:49.808 --> 00:21:52.144
THAT'S THE GOAL THE REASON THAT

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:53.512
I EIGHT ONE OF THE REASONS TO

00:21:53.578 --> 00:21:55.681
INCLUDE T. R. ROSE AS PART OF

00:21:55.747 --> 00:21:58.283
THIS IS FOR EXAMPLE I T. RO MAY

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:00.552
BE ISSUED IN THE FAMILY COURT

00:22:00.619 --> 00:22:02.988
SETTING ON AN EX PARTE BASIS.

00:22:03.055 --> 00:22:04.756
AND THEN THE PARTIES MAY COME

00:22:04.823 --> 00:22:07.025
TO THE FIRST NOTICED HEARING

00:22:07.092 --> 00:22:09.728
AND LET'S SAY FOR EXAMPLE. THEY

00:22:09.795 --> 00:22:10.696
COME TO THAT HEARING IT GETS

00:22:10.762 --> 00:22:11.229
CONTINUED FOR SOME REASON

00:22:11.296 --> 00:22:11.963
BEFORE IT'S HEARD ON THE

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:13.865
MERITS. THE T. R. O. IS RE

00:22:13.932 --> 00:22:15.267
ISSUED AT THAT POINT IT'S

00:22:15.333 --> 00:22:17.235
CONTINUE. SO WE DON'T AND WE

00:22:17.302 --> 00:22:19.504
WANTED TO TRY TO CLOSE OF A

00:22:19.571 --> 00:22:21.373
POSSIBILITY WHERE YOU MIGHT

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:22.708
HAVE A CONTINUANCE OF A

00:22:22.774 --> 00:22:24.443
TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER.

00:22:24.509 --> 00:22:25.944
BUT YOU HAVEN'T DEALT RIGHT

00:22:26.011 --> 00:22:28.680
THERE AT THAT FIRST YEAR WHERE

00:22:28.747 --> 00:22:29.281
BOTH PARTIES HAVE BEEN NOTICED

00:22:29.347 --> 00:22:31.149
AND HAVE APPEARED. WITH THE-

00:22:31.216 --> 00:22:32.384
PARTY HAS REALLY WHICH THEIR

00:22:32.451 --> 00:22:34.486
FIREARMS BECAUSE THE EARLIEST

00:22:34.553 --> 00:22:35.654
THE EARLIEST POINT IN THE

00:22:35.721 --> 00:22:37.155
PROCESS WE CAN ADDRESS THIS.

00:22:37.222 --> 00:22:39.691
DESI FOR WE MAKE VICTIMS THEIR

00:22:39.758 --> 00:22:41.993
FAMILY MEMBERS AND THE

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:42.561
COMMUNITY AT LARGE INCLUDING

00:22:42.627 --> 00:22:48.033
OUR PEACE OFFICERS. ONE OF THE

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:52.037
CHOICE OF. AGAIN LEGISLATION

00:22:52.104 --> 00:22:54.906
COMES IN LATE THERE'S. THERE'S

00:22:54.973 --> 00:22:56.441
NO OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE

00:22:56.508 --> 00:22:59.945
AMENDMENTS BUT I DO BELIEVE I

00:23:00.011 --> 00:23:00.812
THINK IT'S JUST FUNDAMENTAL

00:23:00.879 --> 00:23:02.214
THAT THEY HAVE TO HAVE NOTICE I

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.382
MEAN YOU AND THAT I THINK WOULD

00:23:04.449 --> 00:23:06.952
BE A REQUIREMENT ANY COURT. IF

00:23:07.018 --> 00:23:09.755
IT ISN'T IT SPELLED OUT IT WILL

00:23:09.821 --> 00:23:10.956
GETS BILLS THAT BUT I THINK IT

00:23:11.022 --> 00:23:13.492
AS A LEGITIMATE NOTICE THE

00:23:13.558 --> 00:23:14.526
RIGHT ONCE YOU GET THE

00:23:14.593 --> 00:23:16.228
RESTRAINING ORDER YOU CAN ORDER

00:23:16.294 --> 00:23:18.697
IT SAYS AND ON AN EX PARTE I

00:23:18.764 --> 00:23:19.798
MEAN YOU HAVE TO SERVE THE

00:23:19.865 --> 00:23:21.299
PERSON THAT'S REQUIREMENT IN

00:23:21.366 --> 00:23:23.635
ANY ACT PART BEATING THAT YOU

00:23:23.702 --> 00:23:28.473
CAN GET IT WITHOUT THERE. BEING

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:29.074
PRESSED. BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO

00:23:29.141 --> 00:23:32.844
CERTAIN. CHALLENGE YOUR PLAN I

00:23:32.911 --> 00:23:33.378
THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE'RE

00:23:33.445 --> 00:23:34.279
GONNA HAVE TO WORK ON IS. IN A

00:23:34.346 --> 00:23:35.247
FAMILY LAW MATTER WE KNOW THAT

00:23:35.313 --> 00:23:36.681
MOST. FAMILY LAW LITIGANTS ARE

00:23:36.748 --> 00:23:37.949
IMPROPER MEANING THEY DON'T

00:23:38.016 --> 00:23:40.085
HAVE A LOT. OF AND THAT'S A

00:23:40.152 --> 00:23:42.387
CHALLENGE BUT WE DO HAVE JUDGES

00:23:42.454 --> 00:23:44.956
AND HOPEFULLY WE WILL. BE ABLE

00:23:45.023 --> 00:23:48.160
TO CREATE SOME. OF RULES IN

00:23:48.226 --> 00:23:50.228
SOME PROCEDURES. WHERE THE

00:23:50.295 --> 00:23:52.497
COURTS WILL RECOGNIZE THAT

00:23:52.564 --> 00:23:53.865
WE'RE GIVING THEM A LITTLE BIT

00:23:53.932 --> 00:23:55.801
MORE WORK TO DO BUT- THIS WILL

00:23:55.867 --> 00:23:57.636
SAVE LIVES AND I THINK THAT'S

00:23:57.702 --> 00:23:58.904
PART OF THE- THE URGENCY OF

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:01.006
THIS ITEM. SENATOR I'M GONNA SO

00:24:01.072 --> 00:24:05.110
IF YOU'LL INDULGE MY NEWNESS

00:24:05.177 --> 00:24:05.710
TARDINESS AND IGNORANCE I'D BE

00:24:05.777 --> 00:24:09.381

RECOGNIZE THE URGENCY THE

00:24:13.018 --> 00:24:15.153
ISSUE. I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT WE-

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:17.189

IF WE HADN'T URGENCY CLAUSE. IN

00:24:19.991 --> 00:24:21.960

THAT THE LAYS IT FOR THREE

00:24:23.061 --> 00:24:25.730

00:24:45.083 --> 00:24:46.618

BELIEVE THAT THEY NEED TO ABIDE

00:29:37.242 --> 00:29:40.879

SUPPOSED TO BE. AND THAT'S WHAT

00:29:49.154 --> 00:29:50.088
THIS WOULD DO IS ALWAYS MUST BE

00:29:50.155 --> 00:29:51.723
SUBMITTED BUT WHEN AND THEN THE

TWO PARTIES GO BEFORE THE JUDGE

00:29:53.625 --> 00:29:55.927
THIS JUST AS THE JUDGE TO ASK

00:29:55.994 --> 00:29:56.995
DID YOU TURN IN THAT PAPERWORK

00:29:57.061 --> 00:29:59.597
DO YOU HAVE THAT PROOF. THAT'S

00:29:59.664 --> 00:30:00.165
THAT'S JUST THE MISSING LINK

00:30:00.231 --> 00:30:02.634
THAT WERE ASKING FOR. THE LAW

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:03.835
ALREADY EXISTED THEY'RE

00:30:03.902 --> 00:30:05.303
SUPPOSED TO DO THAT. BUT IF

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:07.705

WILL HELP THEM PROVE. THAT

00:30:15.647 --> 00:30:16.781
TURNED IN SO THEN WHAT'S THE

00:30:16.848 --> 00:30:18.816

THERE'S LOTS OF SITUATIONS IN

00:30:28.893 --> 00:30:30.495
WHICH YOU HAVE NO IDEA IF THE

00:30:30.562 --> 00:30:32.130
RESTRAINT PERSON HAS A FIREARM

00:30:32.197 --> 00:30:33.531
SO YOU'RE SENDING A HEARING FOR

00:30:33.598 --> 00:30:35.567
SOMEBODY WHO ISN'T. GONNA READ

00:30:35.633 --> 00:30:37.235
THE PAPER WORK IN THE FIRST

00:30:37.302 --> 00:30:38.937
PLACE AND YOU EXPECT THAT

00:30:39.003 --> 00:30:39.971
THEY'RE IN A READ THE THING

00:30:40.038 --> 00:30:40.538
THAT YOU SOMETHING ABOUT AND

00:30:40.605 --> 00:30:41.406
THEN YOU'RE GOING TO HOLD A

00:30:41.472 --> 00:30:42.807
HEARING IT IF THEY DON'T READ

00:30:42.874 --> 00:30:43.575
IT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO COME

00:30:43.641 --> 00:30:44.943
AND THEN THE- BUILDING A

00:30:45.009 --> 00:30:46.578
HEARING. NO WONDER FOR THE

00:30:46.644 --> 00:30:47.178
BECAUSE OF TECH PERSON IS NOT

00:30:47.245 --> 00:30:48.379
ACTUALLY REQUIRED TO BE AT THAT

00:30:48.446 --> 00:30:51.082
HEARING TO DO YOU KNOW TO ASK

00:30:51.149 --> 00:30:52.283
IF I THINK IT'S BEEN RELINQUISH

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:53.017
THE BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT

00:30:53.084 --> 00:30:54.586
WHEN THE PARTIES ARE IN COURT I

00:30:54.652 --> 00:30:56.588
THINK IF THIS. LEGISLATION WERE

00:30:56.654 --> 00:30:58.389
LIMITED TO THE TIMES WHEN THE

00:30:58.456 --> 00:30:59.190
RESTRAINT THIS IS ACTUALLY

00:30:59.257 --> 00:31:00.458
APPEARING BEFORE THE COURT

00:31:00.525 --> 00:31:02.327
THAT'S MAKING IN FOLLOW UP

00:31:02.393 --> 00:31:07.465
WOULD BE FAR. LESS CONCERNING

00:31:07.532 --> 00:31:08.032
BREAST AND WANTED OF. EVERY

00:31:08.099 --> 00:31:12.303
SINGLE CASE. THOUGH THAT'S A

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:12.904
DISCUSSION THE PROBLEM IS THAT

00:31:12.971 --> 00:31:13.671
IF PEOPLE DON'T. WANT TO.

00:31:13.738 --> 00:31:14.739
ACKNOWLEDGE RECOGNIZE THE WE

00:31:14.806 --> 00:31:16.975
HAVE A COURT PROCESS IN THE

00:31:17.041 --> 00:31:17.575
COURT SYSTEM WE DON'T WANT TO

00:31:17.642 --> 00:31:21.546
REWARD THEM. I MEAN THE TRUTH

00:31:21.613 --> 00:31:22.146
OF MOTHER THE REAL PROBLEM IS

00:31:22.213 --> 00:31:23.648
85% OF FAMILY LAWLER. GOING TO

00:31:23.715 --> 00:31:24.582
COURT I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT

00:31:24.649 --> 00:31:25.183
THEY'RE DOING. OF BECAUSE THEY

00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:27.752
CAN'T AFFORD. AND TO THE

00:31:27.819 --> 00:31:28.453
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME COOL

00:31:28.519 --> 00:31:29.687
SHOULD HAVE SELF HELP PROGRAMS

00:31:29.754 --> 00:31:32.223
IT REALLY CAN BE OF ASSISTANCE.

00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:33.591
BUT THAT ISN'T THE ISSUE HERE

00:31:33.658 --> 00:31:35.426
THE ISSUE IS HOW DO WE GET

00:31:35.493 --> 00:31:36.527
PEOPLE WHO SHOULD NOT WHOWHO

00:31:36.594 --> 00:31:39.097
HAVE DEMONSTRATED. PROPENSITY

00:31:39.163 --> 00:31:40.198
TO VIOLENT BEHAVIOR WHO HAVE

00:31:40.265 --> 00:31:42.433
FIREARMS TO RULE REMOVE THOSE

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:44.469
FIREARMS FROM THEIR POSSESSION

00:31:44.535 --> 00:31:45.837
BECAUSE WE KNOW IS THOSE

00:31:45.903 --> 00:31:48.673
STAGGERING NUMBERS. INDICATED

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:51.409
WHAT IS IT OF. OVER HALF OF THE

00:31:51.476 --> 00:31:53.811
VICTIMS OF MURDER VICTIMS HALF

00:31:53.878 --> 00:31:55.246
THE WOMEN WERE MURDERED IN THIS

00:31:55.313 --> 00:31:59.083
COUNTRY ARE MURDERED BY AN

00:31:59.150 --> 00:31:59.684
INTIMATE PARTNER WHO WHO KILL

00:31:59.751 --> 00:32:03.488
SOME OF THE FIREARM. THOUSANDS

00:32:03.554 --> 00:32:05.189
OF. I MEAN IT'S STUCK SO WE CAN

00:32:05.256 --> 00:32:06.291
REMOVE THOSE FARM SAID SHE

00:32:06.357 --> 00:32:06.858
ULTIMATE GOAL I THINK THAT'S

00:32:06.924 --> 00:32:08.660
WHY WE'RE HERE. GETTING THROUGH

00:32:08.726 --> 00:32:10.161
THAT PROCESS IN A WAY

00:32:10.228 --> 00:32:12.664
UNDERSTANDING. THAT SOME PEOPLE

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:13.798
ARE JUST NOT GOING TO COMPLY

00:32:13.865 --> 00:32:15.300
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

00:32:15.366 --> 00:32:16.834
DO ON THE OTHER HAND THERE

00:32:16.901 --> 00:32:18.036
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE

00:32:18.102 --> 00:32:18.770
READING IS IT IN A LANGUAGE

00:32:18.836 --> 00:32:20.271
THEY UNDERSTAND IT. DOES THE

00:32:20.338 --> 00:32:22.307
COURT NO CAN WE TRY O SET UP

00:32:22.373 --> 00:32:23.841
SOME PROCEDURES SO THAT THE

00:32:23.908 --> 00:32:25.410
COURT CAN THEN NOTIFY LAW

00:32:25.476 --> 00:32:28.046
ENFORCEMENT. I MEAN THERE'S

00:32:28.112 --> 00:32:29.747
THERE THERE THERE ARE A LOT OF

00:32:29.814 --> 00:32:32.016
QUESTIONS BUT THIS BILL WILL AT

00:32:32.083 --> 00:32:33.851
LEAST FORCE US TO GET THOSE

00:32:33.918 --> 00:32:35.486
