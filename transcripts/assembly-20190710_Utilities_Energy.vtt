THE LAST TWENTY YEARS WHERE.

00:43:46.156 --> 00:43:47.524
WE'RE TRYING.

00:43:47.591 --> 00:43:49.059
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO RESTRUCTURE

00:43:49.126 --> 00:43:51.295
OUR ELECTRICITY UTILITIES WE

00:43:51.362 --> 00:43:52.830
CERTAINLY HAVE FACED SOME OF THE

00:43:52.896 --> 00:43:54.765
CHALLENGES MISTER CHAIRMAN WITH

00:43:54.832 --> 00:43:57.001

00:43:59.803 --> 00:44:00.337
SENATE.

00:44:00.404 --> 00:44:01.739
BECAUSE OF THE ABNORMAL

00:44:01.805 --> 00:44:03.340
SITUATION BECAUSE OF THE EXTRA

00:44:03.407 --> 00:44:04.942
THE THE NEW ABNORMAL.

00:44:05.009 --> 00:44:07.111
BUT ALSO WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT

00:44:07.177 --> 00:44:10.314
HOW DO WE ON THE ONE HAND MOVE

00:44:10.381 --> 00:44:12.082
AWAY FROM THE OLD MODEL.

00:44:12.149 --> 00:44:12.649
RIGHT.

00:44:12.716 --> 00:44:14.184
AND AND THEN COME UP WITH A NEW

00:44:14.251 --> 00:44:15.719
MODEL THAT SUPPORTS OUR CORE

00:44:15.786 --> 00:44:17.154
VALUES THAT DEALS WITH THE GREEN

00:44:17.221 --> 00:44:18.789
ENERGY ISSUES AND PLAY THAT

00:44:18.856 --> 00:44:19.256
WORKS.

00:44:19.323 --> 00:44:21.191
AS A SERIES OF THREE STEPS TO DO

00:44:21.258 --> 00:44:22.126
THAT.

00:44:22.192 --> 00:44:22.960
WE'VE BEEN ADDRESSING ALL OF

00:44:23.027 --> 00:44:24.361
THEM LAST YEAR THIS COMMITTEE WE

00:44:24.428 --> 00:44:26.163
DROPPED WE ADDRESS ARE A

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:28.332
RESOURCE ADEQUACY TO MAKE SURE

00:44:28.399 --> 00:44:30.000
THAT THAT WHEN WE DO THESE PLANS

00:44:30.067 --> 00:44:31.869
WE HAVE ALTERNATIVES THAT THEY

00:44:31.935 --> 00:44:33.537
WORK FOR THE LONG TERM.

00:44:33.604 --> 00:44:35.139
SECOND THE BILL THAT I JUST

00:44:35.205 --> 00:44:36.740
PUSHED OFFER TO YOUR BILL IS

00:44:36.807 --> 00:44:38.842
CENTER BUT CAN PROCUREMENT THAT

00:44:38.909 --> 00:44:40.544
THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY.

00:44:40.611 --> 00:44:42.146
YOU'VE GOT A AS IT IS AT AS THE

00:44:42.212 --> 00:44:43.714
LARGE ARCHITECTURE HAVE A

00:44:43.781 --> 00:44:45.816
CENTRAL PROVIDER TODAY THE THIRD

00:44:45.883 --> 00:44:47.418
ELEMENT OF THAT IS THE PROPER

00:44:47.484 --> 00:44:49.286
THE PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT.

00:44:49.353 --> 00:44:50.587
THE TERM IN THE IN AMONG

00:44:50.654 --> 00:44:54.625
GOVERNMENT US TYPES IS POLAR.

00:44:54.691 --> 00:44:55.692
WHAT WE'RE TRICKING TO DO IS TO

00:44:55.759 --> 00:44:57.127
CONGESTION TO ENSURE CONTINUOUS

00:44:57.194 --> 00:44:59.063
ELECTRICAL SERVICE IN CASE A

00:44:59.129 --> 00:45:00.631
RETAIL PROVIDER LEAVES THE

00:45:00.697 --> 00:45:01.932
MARKET FOR ANY REASON?

00:45:01.999 --> 00:45:04.535
WE SAW THAT IN THE ENERGY CRISIS

00:45:04.601 --> 00:45:06.403
TWENTY YEARS AGO.

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:07.171
THAT'S WE'RE TRYING TO DO SO

00:45:07.237 --> 00:45:09.006
THIS THIS IS A WAY TO BALANCE

00:45:09.073 --> 00:45:10.507
RETAIL CHOICE ON THE ONE HAND

00:45:10.574 --> 00:45:11.708
THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS DEALT

00:45:11.775 --> 00:45:13.544
WITH SO MUCH ON THE ONE HAND.

00:45:13.610 --> 00:45:15.679
HOWEVER NOT ALLOWING ALSO TO

00:45:15.746 --> 00:45:17.981
LOAD SERVICE ENTITIES REGULATED

00:45:18.048 --> 00:45:20.751
FROM LEAVING SOME CUSTOMERS

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:24.555
PRICE PROTECTIONS MORE TO TALK

00:45:24.621 --> 00:45:25.722
ABOUT BUT GIVEN THE FACT THAT

00:45:25.789 --> 00:45:31.728
THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED AND I

00:45:31.795 --> 00:45:33.130

00:45:36.066 --> 00:45:38.735
APOLOGIES I'LL TURN THIS OVER TO

00:45:38.802 --> 00:45:40.904
ARGUE AGO -- LET'S GO SHOULD GO

00:45:40.971 --> 00:45:41.338

00:45:42.372 --> 00:45:43.507
THANK YOU TO CHAIR MEMBERS MARK

00:45:43.574 --> 00:45:44.341

00:45:44.408 --> 00:45:46.844
COALITION CALIFORNIA AGILITY IS

00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:48.479
EMPLOYEES I'LL BE BRIEF.

00:45:48.545 --> 00:45:49.546
MOST OF LAST CENTURY THE

00:45:49.613 --> 00:45:50.647
INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY WAS THE

00:45:50.714 --> 00:45:52.216
ONLY PROVIDER AND THE QUESTION A

00:45:52.282 --> 00:45:53.851
PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT WAS NOT

00:45:53.917 --> 00:45:55.119
A QUESTION ANYBODY ASKED.

00:45:55.185 --> 00:45:56.153
AND SO THERE'S NOTHING IN THE

00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:57.988
PUBLIC UTILITIES CODE

00:45:58.055 --> 00:45:58.622
ESTABLISHING A PROVIDER OF LAST

00:45:58.689 --> 00:45:59.623

WITH DEREGULATION WE HAVE NEW

00:46:01.358 --> 00:46:03.026
RETAIL PROVIDERS.

00:46:03.093 --> 00:46:04.862
AND THERE'S ALWAYS A RISK THAT

00:46:04.928 --> 00:46:06.130
NEW RETAIL PROVIDER.

00:46:06.196 --> 00:46:07.231
WE'LL GO OUT OF BUSINESS OR

00:46:07.297 --> 00:46:08.499

THOUSANDS OF CUSTOMERS DROPPED

00:46:11.401 --> 00:46:13.504
AND RETURN TO THE UTILITY.

00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:16.106
SO WE NEED A SAFETY NET.

00:46:16.173 --> 00:46:18.008
THE THE AFTER ALL AFTER ALMOST

00:46:18.075 --> 00:46:19.309
TWENTY YEARS OF CALM IN THE

PROJECTIONS -- WITH IN THE NOT

WITH EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY

00:49:20.724 --> 00:49:22.826
AND ON BEHALF OF KELSEY CA -- WE

00:49:22.893 --> 00:49:24.861
HAVE SEVERAL CONCERNS WITH THE

00:49:24.928 --> 00:49:25.595
BILL THAT WE WANTED TO RAISE

00:49:25.662 --> 00:49:29.099
TODAY. ONE OF THEM IS THAT.

00:49:29.166 --> 00:49:31.134
UNDER THE CONSTRUCT COPPERY UP

00:49:31.201 --> 00:49:32.769
PROVISIONS IN THE BILL THIS IS

00:49:32.836 --> 00:49:34.638
AN ADDITIONAL FEES THAT OUR

00:49:34.705 --> 00:49:35.906
CUSTOMERS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO

00:49:35.972 --> 00:49:37.474
PAY FOR COMPARED TO WHAT THEY

00:49:37.541 --> 00:49:38.308
PAY TODAY.

00:49:38.375 --> 00:49:40.410
SO TODAY WE AS LOW SERVING

00:49:40.477 --> 00:49:43.947
ENTITIES -- WE POST A BOND AND

00:49:44.014 --> 00:49:45.182
THAT.

00:49:45.248 --> 00:49:46.717
HELPS PROTECT CUSTOMERS IF THERE

00:49:46.783 --> 00:49:48.985
IS AN INVOLUNTARY RETURN TO I

00:49:49.052 --> 00:49:50.721
OWE YOU SERVICE BUT UNDER THIS

00:49:50.787 --> 00:49:52.189
BILL -- THERE WOULD BE

00:49:52.255 --> 00:49:53.857
ADDITIONAL FEES THAT WOULD BE

00:49:53.924 --> 00:49:55.359
LEVIED ON OUR CUSTOMERS ON ALL

00:49:55.425 --> 00:49:57.928
CUSTOMERS PRESUMABLY TO PAY FOR

00:49:57.994 --> 00:49:59.229
THE PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT SO

00:49:59.296 --> 00:50:00.464
WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THOSE FEES

00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:01.865
FOR OUR CUSTOMERS ESPECIALLY AT

00:50:01.932 --> 00:50:03.567
A TIME WHEN CUSTOMER RATES.

00:50:03.633 --> 00:50:05.202
ARE ALREADY RISING BECAUSE OF

00:50:05.268 --> 00:50:07.003
THE BURDENS OF WILDFIRE --

00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:09.606
SECONDLY WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED

00:50:09.673 --> 00:50:12.476
BECAUSE UNDER UNDER THE THE WAY

00:50:12.542 --> 00:50:13.643
THE BILL IS WRITTEN.

00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:16.179
IT HOT TIES THE HANDS OF THE CPC

00:50:16.246 --> 00:50:17.814
SO IT EVEN IF ANOTHER LOAD

00:50:17.881 --> 00:50:19.182
SERVING ENTITY WAS BETTER

00:50:19.249 --> 00:50:21.051
POSITION TO PROVIDE THE PROVIDER

00:50:21.118 --> 00:50:22.519
OF LAST RESORT FUNCTION.

00:50:22.586 --> 00:50:24.855
THE CPUC CANNOT SELECT THAT

00:50:24.921 --> 00:50:26.623
ENTITY AS LONG AS UTILITY

00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:27.758
DOESN'T AGREE.

00:50:27.824 --> 00:50:29.693
SO IT IT GIVES THE UTILITY THE

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:31.261
ABILITY TO PREVENT ANOTHER LOAD

00:50:31.328 --> 00:50:32.596
SERVING ENTITY FROM SITTING INTO

00:50:32.662 --> 00:50:34.965
THAT ROLE -- AND THEN FINALLY

00:50:35.031 --> 00:50:36.700
WERE CONCERNED BECAUSE THE WAY

00:50:36.767 --> 00:50:38.001
THAT THE BILL'S WRITTEN THE

00:50:38.068 --> 00:50:40.804
UTILITY IS NOT -- ASKED TO SHOW

00:50:40.871 --> 00:50:42.239
THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY MEET THE

00:50:42.305 --> 00:50:44.341
CRITERIA THAT IS ASPEN ANY OTHER

00:50:44.408 --> 00:50:45.776
LOAD SERVING ENTITY THAT MIGHT

00:50:45.842 --> 00:50:47.110
WANT TO STEP FORWARD TO FILL THE

00:50:47.177 --> 00:50:47.744
ROLE.

00:50:47.811 --> 00:50:49.413
WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE PROVIDER

00:50:49.479 --> 00:50:51.314
OF LAST RESORT -- FUNCTION IS

00:50:51.381 --> 00:50:53.250
ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL AND IT'S AN

00:50:53.316 --> 00:50:54.684
IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TO BE

00:50:54.751 --> 00:50:56.153
HOPPING WE THINK THAT MORE

00:50:56.219 --> 00:50:57.888
DIALOGUE IS NEEDED ON THIS TOPIC

00:50:57.954 --> 00:50:59.489
THERE ARE A LOT OF OPTIONS.

00:50:59.556 --> 00:51:00.991
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT TOPIC AND

00:51:01.057 --> 00:51:02.092
IT'S IMPORTANT NOT TO

00:51:02.159 --> 00:51:05.362
NECESSARILY ENTRENCH ONE ENTITY

00:51:05.429 --> 00:51:06.863
AND NOT ROLE WITHOUT CONSIDERING

00:51:06.930 --> 00:51:08.432
WHAT ALL OPTIONS MIGHT BE ON THE

00:51:08.498 --> 00:51:10.233
TABLE IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE WE

00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:11.067

THE CURRENT I OWE YOU IN THE

00:53:07.050 --> 00:53:08.685
MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE BILL IS

00:53:08.752 --> 00:53:10.520
THE I OWE YOU.

THAT THIS IS A CPU TO SEE USE.

C. P. YOU SEE.

00:53:18.695 --> 00:53:20.497
OUR DECISION AS TO WHO WOULD BE

00:53:20.564 --> 00:53:22.132
THE PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT CAN

00:53:22.198 --> 00:53:23.867

THE BILL SAYS THAT.

00:53:39.449 --> 00:53:40.183
SO I BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS A

00:53:40.250 --> 00:53:41.785
LANGUAGE ABOUT THE ELECTRICAL

00:53:41.851 --> 00:53:44.354

AND IF ANOTHER ENTITY WANTS TO

STEP UP AND BE THE PROVIDER OF

QUESTION WAS ABOUT THE FEE.

00:54:35.205 --> 00:54:37.674
ARM AND THAT THAT'S WHERE I WANT

00:54:37.741 --> 00:54:38.775

ENERGY SUPPLIER AT ALL.

00:54:53.356 --> 00:54:54.324
THEY WANT TO BECOME A WIRES

00:54:54.391 --> 00:54:56.559
COMPANY RIGHT I KNOW THAT'S NOT

00:54:56.626 --> 00:54:59.029
THE POSITION THAT EDITION HAS.

00:55:04.768 --> 00:55:06.002
PERHAPS MORE.

00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:07.537
HOW DO YOU MANAGE TO BE A

00:55:07.604 --> 00:55:10.206
PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT WHEN YOU

00:55:10.273 --> 00:55:13.043

CURRENTLY SENDING CALIFORNIA

00:55:20.083 --> 00:55:21.851
EDISON DOES SERVE AS THE

00:55:21.918 --> 00:55:24.688
PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT.

00:55:24.754 --> 00:55:25.955
FOR OUR SERVICE AREA AND YOU ARE

00:55:26.022 --> 00:55:27.524
CORRECT THAT WE ARE LOSING

00:55:27.590 --> 00:55:29.292
SIGNIFICAN LOW TO COMMUNITY

00:55:29.359 --> 00:55:32.262
CHOICE AGGREGATOR BUT IN RECENT --

00:55:32.328 --> 00:55:33.897
YEAR IN THE PRISON MONTH WE ALSO

00:55:33.963 --> 00:55:35.298
SEE THE RETURN OF THESE

00:55:35.365 --> 00:55:37.967
CUSTOMERS DUE TO CERTAIN RATE.

00:55:38.034 --> 00:55:41.404
INCREASES IN BEING EXPERIENCE IN.

00:55:41.471 --> 00:55:43.907
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SO IT IS NOT

00:55:43.973 --> 00:55:45.775
CERTAIN RIGHT NOW SO THERE'S

00:55:45.842 --> 00:55:47.711
SOME LOW MIGRATION THAT'S IN

00:55:47.777 --> 00:55:49.779
FLUX CURRENTLY AND THAT'S WHY

00:55:49.846 --> 00:55:52.415
THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT TO SET

00:55:52.482 --> 00:55:54.784
BACK FOUNDATIONAL FRAMEWORK. TO

00:55:54.851 --> 00:55:57.153
ALLOW FOR CERTAINTY IN THE

00:55:57.220 --> 00:55:58.855
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PROVIDER

00:55:58.922 --> 00:55:59.923
OF LAST RESORT.

00:55:59.989 --> 00:56:02.792
OKAY BUT IN THE END SINCE YOU NO

00:56:02.859 --> 00:56:04.227
LONGER HAVE THE LONG TERM

00:56:04.294 --> 00:56:07.931
CONTRACTS TO SERVE THESE FOLKS.

00:56:07.997 --> 00:56:08.998
BOB YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE SPOT

00:56:09.065 --> 00:56:10.700
MARKET IS THAT.

00:56:10.767 --> 00:56:12.001
AM I RIGHT ABOUT THAT ARE.

00:56:12.068 --> 00:56:14.838
THERE IS A PROVISION WITHIN THIS --

00:56:14.904 --> 00:56:17.107
THIS MEASURED THOU WOULD.

00:56:17.173 --> 00:56:19.609
PROVIDE SOME ABILITY FOR THE

00:56:19.676 --> 00:56:21.311
PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO

00:56:21.377 --> 00:56:22.946
SET RULES TO ADDRESS MY LOW

00:56:23.012 --> 00:56:25.215
MIGRATION MATTERS SO IN CASE

00:56:25.281 --> 00:56:26.950
THERE IS A LARGE ON PLANNED

00:56:27.016 --> 00:56:28.651
MIGRATION THERE'S ABILITY FOR

00:56:28.718 --> 00:56:30.787
THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION.

00:56:30.854 --> 00:56:34.124
TO DO SOME OF UP FRONT WORK TO

00:56:34.190 --> 00:56:36.860
MEDICATE A THE NEEDS FOR THE

00:56:36.926 --> 00:56:39.162
PROVIDERS TO PROCURE A LARGE

00:56:39.229 --> 00:56:41.531
AMOUNT OF OUT OF MARKET OR LAST

00:56:41.598 --> 00:56:43.199
MINUTE PROCUREMENT THAT COULD BE

00:56:43.266 --> 00:56:45.034
MORE ON THIRTY THAN WHAT WE

00:56:45.101 --> 00:56:45.802
COULD DO UNDER LONG TERM

00:56:45.869 --> 00:56:47.170
CONTRACT SHOULD BE MORE DIRTY

00:56:47.237 --> 00:56:47.670
BUT IT COULD.

00:56:47.737 --> 00:56:49.873
ALSO BE MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE AND

00:56:49.939 --> 00:56:51.608
YOUR CURRENT RATE STRUCTURE

00:56:51.674 --> 00:56:53.610
WOULD NOT SUPPORT THAT SO I I

00:56:53.676 --> 00:56:54.944
JUST SEE SOME DIFFICULTY YOU

00:56:55.011 --> 00:56:56.346
ACTUALLY DOING IT IF YOU'RE

00:56:56.412 --> 00:56:57.347
PAYING.

00:56:57.413 --> 00:57:03.753
DOLLARS -- FOR MONEY ON HER.

00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:04.921
ATTENTION LEE THE SPOT MARKET

00:57:04.988 --> 00:57:05.822
COULD BE QUITE HIGH YOU COULD BE

00:57:05.889 --> 00:57:07.924
ENDING A PAIN SEVERAL TIMES MORE

00:57:07.991 --> 00:57:09.526
THAN YOUR RATE JUSTIFIES.

00:57:09.592 --> 00:57:12.729
HOW WOULD THE CPUC HANDLE THAT

00:57:12.796 --> 00:57:13.363
SO THAT YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO DO

00:57:13.429 --> 00:57:14.864
IT?

00:57:14.931 --> 00:57:16.966
THESE ARE ALL.

00:57:17.033 --> 00:57:18.468
YES I THINK SO OKAY.

00:57:18.535 --> 00:57:20.336
BUT THIS IS REALLY BEEN THIS IS

00:57:20.403 --> 00:57:21.738
BEEN TWENTY YEARS OF THINKING.

00:57:21.805 --> 00:57:23.473
WHAT'S HAPPENED IS AS PEOPLE

00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:25.008
LEAVE WE HAVE A A REGULATE

00:57:25.074 --> 00:57:26.810
STRUCTURE AND SO THE CHALLENGE

00:57:26.876 --> 00:57:28.545
IT'S BEEN TO LITIGATION AND ALL

00:57:28.611 --> 00:57:30.046
THESE HEARINGS AT THE P. YOU SEE

00:57:30.113 --> 00:57:31.080
HAS BEEN.

00:57:31.147 --> 00:57:32.282
WHAT DO YOU DO TO THE PEOPLE

00:57:32.348 --> 00:57:33.883
THAT LIKE YOU WANNA PUT SOLAR ON

00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:34.184
YOUR ROOF?

00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:35.985
RIGHT AND THERE'S ALL THESE

00:57:36.052 --> 00:57:37.787
SOCIALIZE COST EVERYBODY RIGHT

00:57:37.854 --> 00:57:39.155
WHY IS IT THAT YOU HAVE THE

00:57:39.222 --> 00:57:40.423
RIGHT TO LEAVE WE HAVE WHAT'S

00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:42.859
CALLED THE PROCUREMENT COST IN

00:57:42.926 --> 00:57:44.227
DIFFERENCE AMOUNTS OF THAT THE

00:57:44.294 --> 00:57:45.795
BASICALLY THERE'S A CHARGE. TO

00:57:45.862 --> 00:57:47.197
CUSTOMERS TO LEAVE THAT THEY GOT

00:57:47.263 --> 00:57:48.965
TO PAY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

00:57:49.032 --> 00:57:50.300
PEOPLE WHO ARE LEFT BEHIND ART

00:57:50.366 --> 00:57:51.234
HURT.

00:57:51.301 --> 00:57:53.303
AND THERE'S ALSO A BIG CHARGE OF

00:57:53.369 --> 00:57:54.437
THE WAY THE STRUCTURE WORKS THAT

00:57:54.504 --> 00:57:55.738
IF THEY WANT TO COME BACK ON

00:57:55.805 --> 00:57:57.040
THEY PAY MORE MONEY.

00:57:57.106 --> 00:57:58.241
BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

00:57:58.308 --> 00:57:59.909
IS TO GET FLEXIBILITY IN THE

00:57:59.976 --> 00:58:01.845
MARKET TO LET PEOPLE LEAVE AND

00:58:01.911 --> 00:58:02.812
DO ALL THE THINGS THEY WANT TO

00:58:02.879 --> 00:58:03.546
DO.

00:58:03.613 --> 00:58:04.948
BUT WHAT WE'VE BEEN GRAPPLING

00:58:05.014 --> 00:58:06.816
WITH FOR TWENTY YEARS THIS LARGE

00:58:06.883 --> 00:58:08.318
ISSUE IN THIS IN DIFFERENT SOME

00:58:08.384 --> 00:58:10.019
OUT SO GOING TO YOUR POINT WHICH

00:58:10.086 --> 00:58:11.054
IS IN FACT THE WHAT HAPPENED THE

00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:13.756
ENERGY CRISIS NINETEEN YEARS AGO

00:58:13.823 --> 00:58:13.990
RIGHT.

00:58:14.057 --> 00:58:15.892
IS THIS ISSUE OF WHEAT WHEAT

00:58:15.959 --> 00:58:18.194
WHICH SAYING TO OURSELVES OKAY.

00:58:18.261 --> 00:58:19.929
EVERYBODY'S LEAVING WHAT DO WE

00:58:19.996 --> 00:58:22.232
DO WE AND THE REASON WE LANDED

00:58:22.298 --> 00:58:23.566
ON ON THE INVESTOR OWNED

00:58:23.633 --> 00:58:24.734
UTILITIES IS BECAUSE THEY ARE

00:58:24.801 --> 00:58:25.568
REGULATED.

00:58:25.635 --> 00:58:27.604
THEY'RE COMPLETELY REGULATED AND

00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:28.738
THERE'S A DETERMINES THE WHOLE

00:58:28.805 --> 00:58:30.607
PROCESS BEEN LITIGATED FOR

00:58:30.673 --> 00:58:30.940
TWENTY YEARS.

00:58:31.007 --> 00:58:32.508
THAT THERE ARE FINANCIALLY

00:58:32.575 --> 00:58:33.877
SECURE THEY HAVE A BALANCE SHEET

00:58:33.943 --> 00:58:36.079
THEY HAVE A SYSTEM THEY HAVE THE

00:58:36.145 --> 00:58:37.447
THE THE THE INDIFFERENCE AMOUNT

00:58:37.513 --> 00:58:38.948
TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE COVERED IF

00:58:39.015 --> 00:58:40.516
PEOPLE LEAVE SO WE DON'T HAVE

00:58:40.583 --> 00:58:41.951
THIS BIG LOAD ON PEOPLE.

00:58:42.018 --> 00:58:43.720
COMING FORWARD AND SO WHAT WE

00:58:43.786 --> 00:58:45.755
TRIED TO DO TO QUITE FRANKLY THE

00:58:45.822 --> 00:58:47.490
ANSWER IS WHEN YOU LOOKED AT

00:58:47.557 --> 00:58:49.092
SETS SAN DIEGO.

00:58:49.158 --> 00:58:50.560
WE SAID TO OURSELVES OKAY.

00:58:50.627 --> 00:58:51.227
IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE A PROVIDER

00:58:51.294 --> 00:58:52.896
LOSSES ARE YOU GONNA BE ABLE TO

00:58:52.962 --> 00:58:54.430
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING LAST

00:58:54.497 --> 00:58:55.999
RESORT MEANS LAST RESEARCH GO TO

00:58:56.065 --> 00:58:57.467
KEEP THE LIGHTS ON AND YOU HAVE

00:58:57.533 --> 00:58:58.201
THE MONEY TO DO IT.

00:58:58.268 --> 00:58:59.135
AND THERE'S A WHOLE INTEREST IN

00:58:59.202 --> 00:59:00.904
IN THE IN THE C. C. A.'S OF

00:59:00.970 --> 00:59:02.605
COURSE AND AND SO THE QUESTION

00:59:02.672 --> 00:59:04.641
IS FOR SAN DIEGO FINE IF YOU

00:59:04.707 --> 00:59:05.942
WANT TO TRANSFER THAT.

00:59:06.009 --> 00:59:08.211
THAT OVER THERE TO THE CCA IS

00:59:08.278 --> 00:59:09.812
WELL THEN FINE BUT THERE HAS TO

00:59:09.879 --> 00:59:11.781
BE A PRETTY SIX STANDARD. TO

00:59:11.848 --> 00:59:12.615
MAKE SURE WHOEVER THEY ARE ON

00:59:12.682 --> 00:59:13.950
THE COULD BE SOME NEW INVENTION

00:59:14.017 --> 00:59:15.285
IT DOESN'T MATTER WE GOT TO KEEP

00:59:15.351 --> 00:59:20.623
THE LIGHTS ON AND THE REASON

00:59:20.690 --> 00:59:21.824
JUST YOUR LAST POINT ON YOUR

00:59:21.891 --> 00:59:22.759
QUESTION ABOUT REGIONAL COSTS.

00:59:22.825 --> 00:59:23.393
IT IS REASONABLE COSTS OF COURSE

00:59:23.459 --> 00:59:24.427
THIS COSTS THAT'S THE IDEA OF

00:59:24.494 --> 00:59:24.994
KIND OF THE IN THIS FRENCH

00:59:25.061 --> 00:59:27.897
CHARGE AND WE PUT REASONABLE IN.

00:59:27.964 --> 00:59:28.998
BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:59:29.065 --> 00:59:30.733
THAT WHOEVER'S GONNA CHARGE WERE

00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:32.735
PROTECTING THE CONSUMER SO IT'S

00:59:32.802 --> 00:59:34.804
A DELICATE BALANCE OF A LONG

00:59:34.871 --> 00:59:36.272
DISCUSSION AND ALL OF THIS STUFF.

00:59:36.339 --> 00:59:37.740
AND HOW DO YOU GET FLEXIBILITY

00:59:37.807 --> 00:59:39.709
TO THIS NEW OR DYNAMIC BUT MAKE

00:59:39.776 --> 00:59:41.678
SURE PEOPLE ARE PROTECTED.

00:59:41.744 --> 00:59:42.912
AND THEN WORK ON SOMETHING THAT

00:59:42.979 --> 00:59:44.314
WORKS WITH THAT'S THE FRAMEWORK

00:59:44.380 --> 00:59:45.315
AND THAT I THINK ANSWERS THE

00:59:45.381 --> 00:59:46.950
FORM YOUR QUESTIONS BUT WE DID

00:59:47.016 --> 00:59:48.718
MAKE THOSE CHOICES OKAY BUT THE

00:59:48.785 --> 00:59:50.687
PROBLEM HERE IS THAT THE AMOUNT

00:59:50.753 --> 00:59:51.821
THAT PEOPLE WOULD PAY TO COME

00:59:51.888 --> 00:59:55.992
BACK. TO P. JEANNIE F. R. A C.

00:59:56.059 --> 00:59:58.861
C. A. R. LOST CREDIT RATINGS IN

00:59:58.928 --> 01:00:01.230
AND COULDN'T BY THE ENERGY THEY

01:00:01.297 --> 01:00:01.898
NEEDED.

01:00:01.965 --> 01:00:03.466
WHICH IS A SORT OF THING WE

01:00:03.533 --> 01:00:06.202
WOULD LOOK AT SAY IN TWENTY

01:00:06.269 --> 01:00:06.836
TWENTY ONE THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO

01:00:06.903 --> 01:00:08.304
GET THE LONG TERM CONTRACTS

01:00:08.371 --> 01:00:09.572
BECAUSE OUR BALANCE SHEET ISN'T

01:00:09.639 --> 01:00:10.807
GOOD ENOUGH.

01:00:10.873 --> 01:00:12.241
THE PEOPLE WOULD COME BACK

01:00:12.308 --> 01:00:14.410
THERE'S A FAIRLY SMALL FEE

01:00:14.477 --> 01:00:15.745
INVOLVED.

01:00:15.812 --> 01:00:17.380
WITH PEOPLE COMING BACK AND THEY

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:18.081
COULD.

01:00:18.147 --> 01:00:20.917
IN NO WAY IF THERE IF THEY HAD

01:00:20.984 --> 01:00:22.819
TO GO TO A TIGHT SPOT MARKET.

01:00:22.885 --> 01:00:26.889
THERE'S NO WAY THAT THEY COULD

01:00:26.956 --> 01:00:28.624
IN FACT GET THERE -- NOT PUT A

01:00:28.691 --> 01:00:29.826
HUGE BURDEN ON THE SYSTEM FOR

01:00:29.892 --> 01:00:30.860
THE PEOPLE PARTICULARLY FOR THE

01:00:30.927 --> 01:00:32.829
PEOPLE WHO SAY STATE WITH THE

01:00:32.895 --> 01:00:35.198
WITH THE I. O. U..

01:00:35.264 --> 01:00:35.932
THE SUMMER QUIRK YOU'VE

01:00:35.999 --> 01:00:37.800
IDENTIFIED EXACTLY ONE OF THE

01:00:37.867 --> 01:00:40.136
BIG PROBLEMS AND ONE OF THE

01:00:40.203 --> 01:00:41.838
REASONS FOR THIS BILL WHAT THE

01:00:41.904 --> 01:00:43.506
SCENARIO YOU'VE IDENTIFIED IS

01:00:43.573 --> 01:00:44.741
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED IN THE

01:00:44.807 --> 01:00:46.009
ENERGY CRISIS.

01:00:46.075 --> 01:00:47.443
WHEN ENRON DUMPED?

01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:49.345
YOU KNOW A A LARGE NUMBER OF

01:00:49.412 --> 01:00:51.514
HIGH LOAD CUSTOMERS BACK ON THE

01:00:51.581 --> 01:00:53.383
UTILITIES IN THE PC HAD TO MAKE

01:00:53.449 --> 01:00:54.984
IT UP AS THEY WENT ALONG.

01:00:55.051 --> 01:00:56.753
AND THOSE CUSTOMERS THE CAME

01:00:56.819 --> 01:00:59.222
BACK DID DID END UP PAYING MORE.

01:00:59.288 --> 01:01:00.690
SO DID THE CUSTOMER SHOULD STATE

01:01:00.757 --> 01:01:02.558
WE ALL PAID MORE THAT'S RIGHT WE

01:01:02.625 --> 01:01:05.028
ALL PAY MORE AND IT WAS YOU KNOW

01:01:05.094 --> 01:01:05.928
A DISASTER.

01:01:05.995 --> 01:01:08.498
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THIS BILL

01:01:08.564 --> 01:01:09.665
DOES IS SAY TO THE COMMISSION.

01:01:09.732 --> 01:01:12.268
FIGURE THIS OUT IN ADVANCE SO

01:01:12.335 --> 01:01:13.102
THAT WE'RE NOT THEY DON'T HAVE

01:01:13.169 --> 01:01:14.303
TO FLY BY THE SEAT OF THE PANTS

01:01:14.370 --> 01:01:15.938
IF THAT SHOULD HAPPEN BUT FIGURE

01:01:16.005 --> 01:01:16.739
OUT WHAT THE PROTOCOL IS GOING

01:01:16.806 --> 01:01:18.207
TO BE IN ADVANCE SO THE PROVIDER

01:01:18.274 --> 01:01:19.475
OF LAST RESORT.

01:01:19.542 --> 01:01:21.110
KNOWS WHAT TO DO AND KNOWS WHAT

01:01:21.177 --> 01:01:22.011
THE CHARGE SHOULD BE.

01:01:22.078 --> 01:01:23.679
IT JUST SEEMS BETTER TO PLAN FOR

01:01:23.746 --> 01:01:24.814
AN ADVANCE THAT DIDN'T MAKE IT

01:01:24.881 --> 01:01:26.315
UP ON THE FLY YES SOMEBODY WHO

01:01:26.382 --> 01:01:29.318
STAYED WITH THE I OWE YOU -- I

01:01:29.385 --> 01:01:31.187
WOULD FEEL VERY UPSET IF A WHOLE

01:01:31.254 --> 01:01:34.157
BUNCH OF PEOPLE HAD TO COME BACK.

01:01:34.223 --> 01:01:36.392
AND MY COSTS WENT UP THAT'S THE

01:01:36.459 --> 01:01:37.527
PURPOSE IN DIFFERENT CHARGE

01:01:37.593 --> 01:01:38.861
THAT'S THIS WHOLE TWENTY YEARS

01:01:38.928 --> 01:01:39.929
OF LITIGATION.

01:01:39.996 --> 01:01:42.065
BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S UPSET THAT --

01:01:42.131 --> 01:01:43.433
YOU PEOPLE OVER HERE WANT TO

01:01:43.499 --> 01:01:45.301
LEAVE WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF US

01:01:45.368 --> 01:01:46.836
AND WE NEED A SYSTEM TO PROTECT

01:01:46.903 --> 01:01:48.638
SOCIETY AND THAT'S WHY THESE

01:01:48.704 --> 01:01:50.573
CHARGES ARE ARE IMPOSED UPON

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:51.474
PEOPLE THAT LEAVE WHETHER IT'S

01:01:51.541 --> 01:01:52.909
DIRECT ACCESS PEOPLE.

01:01:52.975 --> 01:01:54.210
WHOEVER IT MIGHT YEAH BUT COMING

01:01:54.277 --> 01:01:55.978
BACK THAT COULD YOU KNOW IF THEY

01:01:56.045 --> 01:02:00.650
HAVE TO GO TO THE SPOT MARKET IN

01:02:00.716 --> 01:02:01.717
THE SPOT MARKET IS TIGHT.

01:02:01.784 --> 01:02:02.418
THEN THAT COULD BE YOU KNOW THEY

01:02:02.485 --> 01:02:03.286
COULD END UP WITH.

01:02:03.352 --> 01:02:04.720
THE PROCUREMENT COST BEING TWO

01:02:04.787 --> 01:02:06.489
OR THREE TIMES WHAT THEY WERE

01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:08.191
FOR THE PEOPLE WHO'D STAYED AND

01:02:08.257 --> 01:02:10.760
MY CONCERN IS SPREADING THAT OUT

01:02:10.827 --> 01:02:12.328
TO THE PEOPLE WHO STAYED.

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:14.197
ARE SAY THE PEOPLE OF NEWARK OR

01:02:14.263 --> 01:02:16.099
PLEASANTON THAT DIDN'T JOIN IN

01:02:16.165 --> 01:02:18.401
THE EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY.

01:02:18.468 --> 01:02:21.904
WITH THOSE FOLKS HAVE TO PAY.

01:02:21.971 --> 01:02:23.573
FOR THE FACT THAT.

01:02:23.639 --> 01:02:26.442
SCCA COLLAPSED -- I'M SURE EAST

01:02:26.509 --> 01:02:28.010
BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY WELL BUT

01:02:28.077 --> 01:02:29.545
I'M JUST GIVING THAT AS AN

01:02:29.612 --> 01:02:30.613
EXAMPLE.

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:31.814
AND I'LL GET YOU TO GET TO YOU

01:02:31.881 --> 01:02:33.883
IN A SECOND BUT MY CONCERN WOULD

01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:34.817
BE.

01:02:34.884 --> 01:02:36.119
I DON'T THINK THE PEOPLE WHO

01:02:36.185 --> 01:02:38.888
DIDN'T GO ON TO SAY THAT THE THE

01:02:38.955 --> 01:02:40.389
COMPANY THAT COLLAPSED SHOULD

01:02:40.456 --> 01:02:41.924
HAVE TO PAY THE COST FOR THE

01:02:41.991 --> 01:02:43.126
PEOPLE CAME BACK.

01:02:43.192 --> 01:02:44.961
THAT'S MY BIG CONCERN SOME OCCUR

01:02:45.027 --> 01:02:46.262
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

01:02:46.329 --> 01:02:47.563
AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED THE

01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:49.599
COMMISSION TO ESTABLISH THE

01:02:49.665 --> 01:02:51.300
RULES TO PROTECT THE CUSTOMERS

01:02:51.367 --> 01:02:52.935
AREN'T THE ONES COMING BACK YEAH.

01:02:53.002 --> 01:02:55.638
YEAH SO THEY THAT NEEDS TO BE IN

01:02:55.705 --> 01:02:57.340
THERE.

01:02:57.406 --> 01:02:58.508
I DON'T KNOW THAT IT IS BUT IT

01:02:58.574 --> 01:03:00.476
REALLY THOSE FOLKS SHOULD BE

01:03:00.543 --> 01:03:02.512
HELD HARMLESS.

01:03:02.578 --> 01:03:04.680
IF PEOPLE COMING BACK --

01:03:04.747 --> 01:03:07.083
SUDDENLY RAISE THE AVERAGE COST

01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:08.951
OF ENERGY.

01:03:09.018 --> 01:03:10.219
SO THAT'S MY CONCERN.

01:03:10.286 --> 01:03:11.954
YES MISS BROWN I MIGHT BE ABLE

01:03:12.021 --> 01:03:13.156
TO RESPOND THERE'S A COUPLE

01:03:13.222 --> 01:03:14.157
THINGS THAT I WANTED TO MAKE

01:03:14.223 --> 01:03:16.159
SURE THAT FOLKS ARE AWARE OF ONE

01:03:16.225 --> 01:03:18.694
IS THAT -- CURRENTLY THE I. O.

01:03:18.761 --> 01:03:20.363
USED TO SERVE AS THE PROVIDER OF

01:03:20.429 --> 01:03:22.532
LAST RESORT SO THAT ROLE IS NOT

01:03:22.598 --> 01:03:24.834
BEING UNFAITHFUL TODAY SECONDLY

01:03:24.901 --> 01:03:26.502
ON THE COMMISSION HAS A

01:03:26.569 --> 01:03:27.870
PROCEEDING.

01:03:27.937 --> 01:03:31.007
THAT - ESTABLISHED A BOND THAT

01:03:31.073 --> 01:03:32.742
ALL LOW SERVING ENTITIES HAVE TO

01:03:32.808 --> 01:03:34.443
PAY AND THAT BOND IS MEANT TO

01:03:34.510 --> 01:03:36.546
COVER ANY ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT

01:03:36.612 --> 01:03:38.447
COULD BE IN KERN AND PUT UPON

01:03:38.514 --> 01:03:40.049
ANY CUSTOMERS THAT REMAIN WITH

01:03:40.116 --> 01:03:40.816
UTILITY.

01:03:40.883 --> 01:03:42.185
SO THAT IS THE MECHANISM THE

01:03:42.251 --> 01:03:43.719
FINANCIAL MECHANISM IN PLACE

01:03:43.786 --> 01:03:45.121
TODAY AND THE AMOUNT OF THAT

01:03:45.188 --> 01:03:47.390
BOND IS ACTUALLY BASED IN PART

01:03:47.456 --> 01:03:49.392
ON MARKET PRICES SO AS THE

01:03:49.458 --> 01:03:50.960
MARKET PRICES OF ENERGY.

01:03:51.027 --> 01:03:52.762
GO UP -- YOU'LL SEE THAT THE

01:03:52.828 --> 01:03:54.664
BOND THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO

01:03:54.730 --> 01:03:55.865
POST GOES UP AS WELL YEAH BUT

01:03:55.932 --> 01:03:58.334
THOSE ARE THOSE THE SPOT PRICE.

01:03:58.401 --> 01:03:59.902
PRICES AT THE CLOSE ON SPOT

01:03:59.969 --> 01:04:01.470
MARKET PRICE PRICES BASED ON

01:04:01.537 --> 01:04:03.072
SPOT MARKET PRICES MY CONCERN

01:04:03.139 --> 01:04:04.240
THOUGH IS THAT.

01:04:04.307 --> 01:04:05.942
IF WE GET TO THE SITUATION WE

01:04:06.008 --> 01:04:08.377
HAD IN.

01:04:08.444 --> 01:04:08.978
TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND ONE

01:04:09.045 --> 01:04:09.879
THE SPOT MARKET SUDDENLY WENT

01:04:09.946 --> 01:04:11.214
WAY UP.

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:13.115
AND SO I'M NOT SURE THOSE BONDS

01:04:13.182 --> 01:04:14.517
WILL DO IT NOW.

01:04:14.584 --> 01:04:17.320
THAT SO WELL I THINK I'VE I'VE

01:04:17.386 --> 01:04:18.254
GOTTEN THROUGH THAT PART.

01:04:18.321 --> 01:04:19.956
NOW THERE IS ALSO THE SECOND

01:04:20.022 --> 01:04:21.290
THING YOU BROUGHT ABOUT YOU

01:04:21.357 --> 01:04:26.329
TALKED ABOUT IS THAT THERE NEEDS

01:04:26.395 --> 01:04:28.831
TO BE A A FEE PAID TO THE

01:04:28.898 --> 01:04:29.765
PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT.

01:04:29.832 --> 01:04:31.601
AND THAT HE IS DETERMINED BY THE

01:04:31.667 --> 01:04:33.569
CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITY

01:04:33.636 --> 01:04:35.938
COMMISSION AND TO PASS THE

01:04:36.005 --> 01:04:37.406
SENATOR AUTHOR.

01:04:37.473 --> 01:04:39.642
OR ONE OF YOUR EXPERTS.

01:04:39.709 --> 01:04:41.744
HOW IS THAT FEE LIKELY TO BE

01:04:41.811 --> 01:04:44.180
DETERMINED BY THE CPU CD YOU MAY

01:04:44.247 --> 01:04:45.948
OR MAY NOT HAVE AN IDEA BUT IF

01:04:46.015 --> 01:04:48.417
YOU DO -- WHAT IS THAT FEE

01:04:48.484 --> 01:04:51.587
INTENDED TO DO AND HOW IS?

01:04:51.654 --> 01:04:53.756
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT

01:04:53.823 --> 01:04:55.625
CRITERIA WILL BE USED TO SET IT.

01:04:55.691 --> 01:04:56.792
I THINK THERE'S A THERE'S A

01:04:56.859 --> 01:04:58.394
ALREADY THAT THE PC HAS QUITE

01:04:58.461 --> 01:05:00.029
YOUR TO SET FEES WE PUT THE WORD

01:05:00.096 --> 01:05:02.098
REASONABLE AN THAT'S THE WHOLE

01:05:02.164 --> 01:05:03.633
STRUCTURE 90% OF WHAT THEY DO

01:05:03.699 --> 01:05:04.400
OVER THERE.

01:05:04.467 --> 01:05:05.935
AS IT RELATES THE ENERGY UTILITY

01:05:06.002 --> 01:05:07.937
MARKET IS LOOK AT PEOPLE'S

01:05:08.004 --> 01:05:09.305
REIMBURSEMENT SO WHAT THE COSTS

01:05:09.372 --> 01:05:10.873
ARE WITH THE RATE OF RETURNS ARE

01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:12.475
IN THOSE TYPES OF THINGS.

01:05:12.541 --> 01:05:14.110
AND WE PUT THE WORD REASONABLE

01:05:14.176 --> 01:05:15.511
IN BECAUSE WE JUST IN ONE SO YOU

01:05:15.578 --> 01:05:16.846
COULD CHARGE A FEE WE WANTED TO

01:05:16.912 --> 01:05:18.314
MAKE SURE THAT THE P. YOU SEE

01:05:18.381 --> 01:05:20.249
THROUGH ITS ORDINARY STRUCTURE --

01:05:20.316 --> 01:05:24.086
LIMITS IT TO MAKE SURE CONSUMERS

01:05:24.153 --> 01:05:25.988
ARE PROTECTED -- BUT WHAT WOULD

01:05:26.055 --> 01:05:26.589
THAT FEES SUPPOSEDLY PAY FOR

01:05:26.656 --> 01:05:27.657
BECAUSE I DON'T SEE A LOT OF

01:05:27.723 --> 01:05:28.658
COSTS.

01:05:28.724 --> 01:05:30.359
UNTIL THE THING HAPPENS MAYBE

01:05:30.426 --> 01:05:32.028
THERE'S SOME PLANNING COSTS BUT

01:05:32.094 --> 01:05:33.562
I WOULD THINK POLICY WOULD BE

01:05:33.629 --> 01:05:35.865
FAIRLY LOW I THINK THAT'S TRUE.

01:05:35.931 --> 01:05:37.767
OKAY SO IT'S TRUE WE WOULD WE

01:05:37.833 --> 01:05:39.669
COULD ALL IT IS LIKELY IT'LL BE

01:05:39.735 --> 01:05:41.337
FAIRLY LOW BECAUSE IT ALL IT IS

01:05:41.404 --> 01:05:42.071
IS PLANNING.

01:05:42.138 --> 01:05:44.440
IS THAT YOUR AT THIS POINT YES

01:05:44.507 --> 01:05:45.875
OKAY ACTUALLY IT'S A SMALL

01:05:45.941 --> 01:05:47.810
NUMBER BUT YOU GOT TO PROVIDE

01:05:47.877 --> 01:05:48.644
FOR AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID IT

01:05:48.711 --> 01:05:50.112
AND WE PUT REASONABLE TO PROTECT

01:05:50.179 --> 01:05:51.414
CONSUMERS OKAY.

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:53.015
UP MISPRINT WAS -- ANOTHER

01:05:53.082 --> 01:05:54.150
CONCERN YOU HAVE.

01:05:54.216 --> 01:05:55.918
SO ONE OF THE OTHER CONCERNS

01:05:55.985 --> 01:05:57.653
THAT WE HAD WAS THAT -- THAT THE

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:59.355
UTILITIES ARE NOT ACTUALLY HELD

01:05:59.422 --> 01:06:00.956
TO THE SAME STANDARDS THEY DON'T

01:06:01.023 --> 01:06:02.658
THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED TO MEET THE

01:06:02.725 --> 01:06:03.492
STANDARDS THAT ARE PUT INTO THE

01:06:03.559 --> 01:06:05.161
BILL FOR OTHER LOAD SERVING

01:06:05.227 --> 01:06:07.296
ENTITIES TO MEET IN ORDER TO

01:06:07.363 --> 01:06:08.464
BECOME THE POLDER.

01:06:08.531 --> 01:06:11.100
I DON'T SEE THAT THAT COULD THE

01:06:11.167 --> 01:06:11.834
AUTHOR.

01:06:11.901 --> 01:06:12.668
THAT.

01:06:12.735 --> 01:06:13.969
MIA IT WILL THERE THEY ARE THE

01:06:14.036 --> 01:06:16.172
POLAR THEY THEY THEY ARE ALREADY

01:06:16.238 --> 01:06:17.573
REGULAR UTILITY.

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:19.742
BY OPERATION OF BUT BUT THAT THE

01:06:19.809 --> 01:06:20.576
ENTIRE STRUCTURE OF THE LAW.

01:06:20.643 --> 01:06:22.311
I MEAN I I DON'T APOLOGIZE MAYBE

01:06:22.378 --> 01:06:24.113
JUST MY INABILITY UNDERSTAND BUT

01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:25.181
THE IDEA THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO

01:06:25.247 --> 01:06:26.449
MEET THE REQUIREMENTS THEY

01:06:26.515 --> 01:06:28.351
ALREADY ARE THE POLAR WHAT WE'RE

01:06:28.417 --> 01:06:29.852
REALLY DOING HERE.

01:06:29.919 --> 01:06:31.921
IS SAYING OKAY HE'S A PROVIDERS

01:06:31.987 --> 01:06:32.955
LAST RESORT THAT MEANS YOU'RE IN

01:06:33.022 --> 01:06:34.590
TROUBLE SOMETHING BIG HAPPENED

01:06:34.657 --> 01:06:35.758
AND YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE IS A

01:06:35.825 --> 01:06:37.893
GOVERNMENT WE ARE AS WAS

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:38.794
INDICATED.

01:06:38.861 --> 01:06:40.096
PLANNING IN ADVANCE SO WE'RE

01:06:40.162 --> 01:06:41.731
TRYING TO BE THOUGHTFUL AS WE'VE

01:06:41.797 --> 01:06:43.065
NOW TORN APART THE WHOLE

01:06:43.132 --> 01:06:44.934
STRUCTURE OF OUR ENERGIES

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:45.534
PROVIDED.

01:06:45.601 --> 01:06:47.737
AND COMPLETELY TURNED IT UPSIDE

01:06:47.803 --> 01:06:49.472
DOWN AND WE SAID WE BETTER MAKE

01:06:49.538 --> 01:06:50.639
SURE SO WE AVOID ANOTHER ENERGY

01:06:50.706 --> 01:06:52.675
CRISIS WE HAVE PART OF THAT PLAN

01:06:52.742 --> 01:06:53.843
THAT SOMEBODY'S A PROVIDER OF

01:06:53.909 --> 01:06:54.877
LAST RESORT.

01:06:54.944 --> 01:06:56.445
AND THE STARTING POINT IS THE

01:06:56.512 --> 01:06:57.713
EXISTING PEOPLE SO WE'RE NOT

01:06:57.780 --> 01:06:59.081
DESIGNATING THEM UNDER NEW

01:06:59.148 --> 01:07:00.149
THINGS THEY ALREADY ARE THE

01:07:00.216 --> 01:07:01.450
PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT IN THE

01:07:01.517 --> 01:07:02.318
LAW.

01:07:02.385 --> 01:07:03.786
THEIR OBLIGATION IS TO SERVE

01:07:03.853 --> 01:07:05.221
THAT'S WHAT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES

01:07:05.287 --> 01:07:07.590
CODE SAYS THAT'S THE ENTIRE

01:07:07.656 --> 01:07:09.158
STRUCTURE OF THE STATE OF

01:07:09.225 --> 01:07:10.493
CALIFORNIA SO I'VE KNOWLEDGE

01:07:10.559 --> 01:07:11.660
WHERE SOMETHING IS THAT WHAT

01:07:11.727 --> 01:07:13.963
WE'RE SEEING HERE IS JUST ONE

01:07:14.029 --> 01:07:16.031
DOLLAR YEAH WILL NOT LET ME.

01:07:16.098 --> 01:07:17.099
TO MY REGARDING OUR IT IS BETTER

01:07:17.166 --> 01:07:18.200
TO JUST FOR A SECOND I JUST WANT

01:07:18.267 --> 01:07:18.768
TO MAKE SURE THAT MY MISSING

01:07:18.834 --> 01:07:19.368
SOMETHING APOLOGY YOU'RE NOT

01:07:19.435 --> 01:07:20.369
MISSING ANYTHING BUT I DO WANT

01:07:20.436 --> 01:07:21.437
YOU TO FILL BUT YOU.

01:07:21.504 --> 01:07:28.677
ASKED THE QUESTION BUT IT SOUNDS

01:07:28.744 --> 01:07:30.846
LIKE YOU ASKED HAS BEEN ANSWERED

01:07:30.913 --> 01:07:32.081
OR A COUPLE DIFFERENT ALL RIGHT

01:07:32.148 --> 01:07:32.748
NOW THIS IS A DIFFERENT QUESTION.

01:07:32.815 --> 01:07:33.315
THE QUESTION IS [inaudible]

01:07:33.382 --> 01:07:35.317
ARE THE IF THE CPU CA BECAME A

01:07:35.384 --> 01:07:35.985
PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT WITH THE

01:07:36.051 --> 01:07:37.019
REQUIREMENTS FOR THEM BE ANY

01:07:37.086 --> 01:07:39.455
DIFFERENT THAN THEY WOULD BE FOR

01:07:39.522 --> 01:07:40.856
AND I OWE YOU.

01:07:40.923 --> 01:07:42.158
IN MY READING OF THE BILL IS

01:07:42.224 --> 01:07:43.325
THAT THEY BE THE SAME THEY

01:07:43.392 --> 01:07:45.027
BECOME A PUBLICLY REGULATED

01:07:45.094 --> 01:07:45.961
UTILITY.

01:07:46.028 --> 01:07:47.530
AND THEY WOULD HAVE EXACTLY THE

01:07:47.596 --> 01:07:49.665
SAME REGULATIONS AS THE PUBLIC.

01:07:49.732 --> 01:07:52.101
ART PUBLICLY REGULATED UTILITY

01:07:52.168 --> 01:07:53.302
BUT IS THAT THE CASE OR IS IT

01:07:53.369 --> 01:07:57.206
DIFFERENT -- DOCTOR QUIRK AND

01:07:57.273 --> 01:07:58.841
THE VERY LAST PAGE OF THE BILL

01:07:58.908 --> 01:08:00.209
WHICH SAYS THAT.

01:08:00.276 --> 01:08:01.477
IF THE IF EAST BAY COMMUNITY

01:08:01.544 --> 01:08:02.778
ENERGY BECAME THE PROVIDER OF

01:08:02.845 --> 01:08:03.813
LAST RESORT.

01:08:03.879 --> 01:08:05.014
IT WOULD BE REGULATED AS A

01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:07.383
PUBLIC UTILITY FOR THE PROVIDER

01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:09.852
OF LAST RESORT SERVICES.

01:08:09.919 --> 01:08:10.920
BUT JUST FOR THOSE SERVICES.

01:08:10.986 --> 01:08:12.955
OKAY SO THEY WOULD BE AGAIN IT'S

01:08:13.022 --> 01:08:15.157
AT THIS SO OF THE THREE

01:08:15.224 --> 01:08:17.526
OBJECTIONS. ONE OF THEM IS THE

01:08:17.593 --> 01:08:19.428
FEE WHICH WOULD BE LOW.

01:08:19.495 --> 01:08:23.299
THE OTHER IS THAT -- THAT THEY

01:08:23.365 --> 01:08:25.134
WOULD BE REGULATED IN THE SAME

01:08:25.201 --> 01:08:26.635
WAY NOT A DIFFERENT WAY.

01:08:26.702 --> 01:08:28.437
SO I DON'T SEE THAT THE MAIN

01:08:28.504 --> 01:08:30.272
CONCERN THAT I THINK YOU STILL

01:08:30.339 --> 01:08:32.908
HAVE THOUGH IS THAT -- THE

01:08:32.975 --> 01:08:35.177
DEFAULT IS THE IS STILL GOING TO

01:08:35.244 --> 01:08:38.681
BE THE ARM UTILITY THE UTILITY

01:08:38.747 --> 01:08:40.316
AND YOUR CONCERN THAT THAT

01:08:40.382 --> 01:08:41.817
SHOULDN'T BE THE CASE.

01:08:41.884 --> 01:08:43.652
I'M CONCERNED THAT WE HAVE TO

01:08:43.719 --> 01:08:45.054
OBTAIN THE UTILITIES PERMISSION

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:47.022
IN ORDER TO APPLY TO BE THE

01:08:47.089 --> 01:08:48.557
PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT AND I

01:08:48.624 --> 01:08:50.059
ALSO REMAIN CONCERNED THAT WE

01:08:50.125 --> 01:08:52.294
HAVE TO APPLY AND MEET CERTAIN

01:08:52.361 --> 01:08:53.429
STANDARDS.

01:08:53.496 --> 01:08:55.331
THAT THE UTILITIES HAVE NOT

01:08:55.397 --> 01:08:57.233
DEMONSTRATED THEY CAN HIT.

01:08:57.299 --> 01:08:58.501
LOOK AT FINANCING OF I HAVE NO I

01:08:58.567 --> 01:09:00.102
I I JUST DON'T BUY THAT ARGUMENT.

01:09:00.169 --> 01:09:02.338
I THINK THAT IT'S PRETTY CLEAR

01:09:02.404 --> 01:09:03.806
BUT LET'S GET BACK TO IT WHY DID

01:09:03.873 --> 01:09:06.275
YOU MAKE THE I. O. U.'S HAVE TO

01:09:06.342 --> 01:09:11.080
GET PERMISSION WHY NOT JUST LET

01:09:11.146 --> 01:09:13.449
THE C. P. U. C. DECIDE.

01:09:13.516 --> 01:09:14.717
IF I COULD -- DOCTOR QUIRK

01:09:14.783 --> 01:09:16.318
ARNOLD IF YOU CAN ANSWERED --

01:09:16.385 --> 01:09:17.553
BUT THEN I'M GOING TO HAVE TO

01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:18.854
MOVE TO DOT -- SHARE THIS MATTER

01:09:18.921 --> 01:09:21.190
SUCI AND SORT OF GIVE OTHERS A

01:09:21.257 --> 01:09:23.592
CHANCE TO WEIGH IN ON IT BUT

01:09:23.659 --> 01:09:24.994
SENATOR IF YOU.

01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:26.395
LIKE THE ANSWERS IN THE MARK

01:09:26.462 --> 01:09:27.596
ALSO ADD INTO THIS STUFF WITH

01:09:27.663 --> 01:09:29.031
THE ANSWER REALLY IS IS THAT

01:09:29.098 --> 01:09:30.566
THEY ARE THE PRIOR PROVIDER OF

01:09:30.633 --> 01:09:32.301
LAST RESORT AND THEY GOT TO MAKE

01:09:32.368 --> 01:09:33.469
SURE.

01:09:33.536 --> 01:09:36.071
THAT THAT WHOEVER'S TAKING OVER

01:09:36.138 --> 01:09:37.940
HAS THE FINANCIAL CAPACITY AND

01:09:38.007 --> 01:09:39.508
THE ABILITY TO DO IT THIS IS A

01:09:39.575 --> 01:09:41.510
PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT THIS IS

01:09:41.577 --> 01:09:44.079
THE EMERGENCY PLAN.

01:09:44.146 --> 01:09:45.314
AND SO WE HAVE A STRUCTURE

01:09:45.381 --> 01:09:46.982
THAT'S BEEN IN CALIFORNIA FOR

01:09:47.049 --> 01:09:48.484
ALMOST A HUNDRED YEARS.

01:09:48.551 --> 01:09:49.752
AND WE'VE DEVELOPED THAT

01:09:49.818 --> 01:09:51.153
STRUCTURE WE HAVE THESE THEY

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:52.421
KNOW THE POPE POLLS ANOTHER

01:09:52.488 --> 01:09:53.622
WIRES AND OTHER SYSTEMS IN ORDER

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:55.090
THE IT'S GOING ON THERE THE

01:09:55.157 --> 01:09:56.392
PEOPLE THAN THE MAIN SERVICE

01:09:56.458 --> 01:09:57.726
PROVIDERS THIS THE OTHER

01:09:57.793 --> 01:09:58.627
ENTITIES THAT ARE IN THE THING

01:09:58.694 --> 01:10:00.329
WHETHER IT'S DIRECT ACCESS OR

01:10:00.396 --> 01:10:02.197
WHATEVER THE OTHER PLAYERS ARE.

01:10:02.264 --> 01:10:02.798
HAVE THEIR OWN LITTLE MARKETS

01:10:02.865 --> 01:10:05.201
AND STUFF AND IT SEEMS TO ME IS

01:10:05.267 --> 01:10:06.936
THAT IT'S THE MOST PRUDENT THING

01:10:07.002 --> 01:10:09.138
TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S

01:10:09.204 --> 01:10:10.339
THE CASE.

01:10:10.406 --> 01:10:12.775
AND AND IT IT ALSO TO ME IS THE

01:10:12.841 --> 01:10:14.276
BEST CHECK AND BALANCE ON THE

01:10:14.343 --> 01:10:15.744
DEAL INSTEAD OF JUSTGOING TO

01:10:15.811 --> 01:10:17.413
THE GOVERNMENT SAYING OKAY YOU

01:10:17.479 --> 01:10:18.747
GO FIGURE THIS OUT LET'S GIVE

01:10:18.814 --> 01:10:20.049
THEM SOMETHING ELSE TO DO ON TOP

01:10:20.115 --> 01:10:21.917
THE WILDFIRES -- I SEE ALL RIGHT

01:10:21.984 --> 01:10:25.854
WELL I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL

01:10:25.921 --> 01:10:27.590
THEN THANK YOU I UNDERSTAND --

01:10:27.656 --> 01:10:30.893
MISSED RESEARCH.

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:32.895
THANK YOU I THINK A MOST OF MY

01:10:32.962 --> 01:10:34.430
QUESTION WAS ANSWERED -- BUT

01:10:34.496 --> 01:10:37.366
SENATOR.

01:10:37.433 --> 01:10:38.901
THIS IS A LITTLE -- FOCUSING ON

01:10:38.968 --> 01:10:39.735
THE ISSUE OF WHY THEY'RE IN

01:10:39.802 --> 01:10:40.869
THERE NEEDS TO BE A JOINT

01:10:40.936 --> 01:10:42.438
APPLICATION SO YOU'RE YOU'RE

01:10:42.504 --> 01:10:43.672
YOU'RE YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT

01:10:43.739 --> 01:10:45.608
THAT IT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE THEY

01:10:45.674 --> 01:10:47.876
THEY ARE THE EXISTING POLAR AND

01:10:47.943 --> 01:10:49.545
AND THAT SOMEHOW NOT JUST THE P.

01:10:49.612 --> 01:10:52.982
YOU SEE BUT THE UTILITY.

01:10:53.048 --> 01:10:56.385
SHOULD SOMEHOW BE AN A VETTING

01:10:56.452 --> 01:10:58.988
PROCESS -- IN IN TERMS OF THE

01:10:59.054 --> 01:11:00.022
POLAR THAT WOULD REPLACE THAT I

01:11:00.089 --> 01:11:01.957
OWE YOU YEAH EXACTLY I MEAN NOT

01:11:02.024 --> 01:11:03.926
NOT IT'S ONLY THIS IS A LAST

01:11:03.993 --> 01:11:05.361
RESORT THIS THE EMERGENCY PLAN

01:11:05.427 --> 01:11:07.162
THIS THE RIP CORD.

01:11:07.229 --> 01:11:08.097
AND THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT

01:11:08.163 --> 01:11:09.264
ARE INVOLVED YOU'RE GONNA GIVE

01:11:09.331 --> 01:11:10.733
IT TO A BUNCH OF FOLKS IN THE PC

01:11:10.799 --> 01:11:12.101
FIND THEY CAN REVIEW IT.

01:11:12.167 --> 01:11:13.335
BUT CERTAINLY THE PEOPLE THAT

01:11:13.402 --> 01:11:14.803
HAVE BEEN IN THE THE THE THE

01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:16.205
BASICALLY THE CATBIRD SEAT THE

01:11:16.271 --> 01:11:17.139
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TAKING ON THE

01:11:17.206 --> 01:11:18.707
RESPONSIBILITY THAT OF PLANNING

01:11:18.774 --> 01:11:20.542
AND WORKING SO HARD.

01:11:20.609 --> 01:11:21.477
SHOULD TAKE THE FIRST SCRUB AT

01:11:21.543 --> 01:11:23.412
IT AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE

01:11:23.479 --> 01:11:24.980
COMFORTABLE IN TERMS OF THEIR

01:11:25.047 --> 01:11:26.548
CUSTOMERS TO BEING HAVING

01:11:26.615 --> 01:11:29.318
SOMEBODY ELSE HOLD THAT RECORD.

01:11:29.385 --> 01:11:30.352
THE EVENT THAT THERE'S URGENCY

01:11:30.419 --> 01:11:32.054
AND I JUST IT'S JUST A REAL KIND

01:11:32.121 --> 01:11:34.123
OF CONSERVATIVE RESPONSIBLE

01:11:34.189 --> 01:11:35.257
APPROACH. TO WHAT SHOULD

01:11:35.324 --> 01:11:36.759
SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN TO AN ENERGY

01:11:36.825 --> 01:11:38.460
CRISIS ADD TO LIVE THROUGH IT

01:11:38.527 --> 01:11:39.962
AND YOU WE CAN'T TAKE A RISK AND

01:11:40.029 --> 01:11:41.430
SO THE IDEA IS IF IT'S A LITTLE

01:11:41.497 --> 01:11:42.431
TOUGHER STANDARD.

01:11:42.498 --> 01:11:45.200
SO BE IT LET'S PROTECT PEOPLE

01:11:45.267 --> 01:11:45.834
AND MAKE SURE WE DON'T MAKE A

01:11:45.901 --> 01:11:48.003
MISTAKE AND NOT JUST TURN IT TO

01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:50.272
THE P. UC BUT CREATE PART OF TO

01:11:50.339 --> 01:11:51.340
CHARGES THAT THEY GOT TO GO

01:11:51.407 --> 01:11:53.542
THROUGH BED BED GIVEN THAT

SHARE YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE

01:11:58.647 --> 01:12:00.249
HISTORY WITH US -- BEAT IS

01:12:00.315 --> 01:12:01.583
NEEDED TO TRUE THAT.

01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:02.918
TO THERE THERE HAVE BEEN --

01:12:02.985 --> 01:12:06.655
THERE IS A HISTORY OF UTILITIES

01:12:06.722 --> 01:12:07.222
THAT ARE BUT THAT OR TRY TO

01:12:07.289 --> 01:12:10.259
UNDERMINE -- CCA'S -- ESPECIALLY

01:12:10.325 --> 01:12:11.326
WHEN THEY'RE FOR ST GETTING

01:12:11.393 --> 01:12:12.795
STRAIGHT YES OF COURSE.

01:12:12.861 --> 01:12:14.797
AND LET'S NOT THE HOUSE HERE WE

01:12:14.863 --> 01:12:16.899
PASSED THE CCA'S ROSTER Là TWO

01:12:16.965 --> 01:12:17.866
THOUSAND ONE GIRL MEGAN'S BILL

01:12:17.933 --> 01:12:18.967
IS INTENDED FOR COMPLETELY

01:12:19.034 --> 01:12:20.703
DIFFERENT PURPOSE IT'S NOW BUT

01:12:20.769 --> 01:12:21.970
ALL CHANGE I HAVE NO OBJECTION.

01:12:22.037 --> 01:12:23.772
I ONLY CARE THAT THAT BALANCE

01:12:23.839 --> 01:12:25.207
SHEETS ARE REAL AND THEY COULD

01:12:25.274 --> 01:12:27.176
REALLY DO IT IN LA COUNTY WAS

01:12:27.242 --> 01:12:28.444
THIRTEEN MAYBE IT SEVENTY EIGHTY

01:12:28.510 --> 01:12:29.778

BEEN RAISED -- BY THE CCA --

01:13:16.759 --> 01:13:18.093
INDUSTRY AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS

01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:19.228
THE MAIN THE MARKET CONTINUES TO

01:13:19.294 --> 01:13:20.596
GET FRAGMENTED AND WE'RE TRYING

01:13:20.662 --> 01:13:22.064
TO FIGURE OUT HOW ALL OF THIS

01:13:22.131 --> 01:13:23.832
ULTIMATELY COMES TOGETHER AND

01:13:23.899 --> 01:13:25.400
SOLIDIFIES DOWN THE ROAD.

01:13:25.467 --> 01:13:27.002
BUT IN THE MEAN TIME WHEN WE SEE

01:13:27.069 --> 01:13:29.938
SUCH -- DISRUPTION IN THE MARKET

01:13:30.005 --> 01:13:32.207

01:13:41.717 --> 01:13:44.052
WAY TO GO -- BUT WE OBVIOUSLY

01:13:44.119 --> 01:13:45.154
WANT TO MAKE SURE THE MARKET

01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:47.356
PLACE CONTINUES TO BE VIABLE FOR

01:13:47.422 --> 01:13:49.458
SOME DAYS TO CONTINUE TO GROW TO

THE STATE'S ASSOCIATION OF

01:22:01.616 --> 01:22:03.018
ELECTRICAL WORKERS IN THE

01:22:03.084 --> 01:22:04.352
WESTERN STATES COUNCIL OF SHEET

01:22:04.419 --> 01:22:06.821
METAL WORKERS -- THE ENERGY

01:22:06.888 --> 01:22:09.057
EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS AT THE P.

01:22:09.124 --> 01:22:10.492
YOU SEE THE REBATE PROGRAM SO

01:22:10.558 --> 01:22:12.060
YOU'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THAT

01:22:12.127 --> 01:22:13.662
HAVE OPERATED FOR YEARS.

01:22:13.728 --> 01:22:15.096
I THINK THEY YOU KNOW THERE ARE

01:22:15.163 --> 01:22:16.898
OVER BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FIVE

01:22:16.965 --> 01:22:19.834
IF I'M NOT INCORRECT -- TIME AND

01:22:19.901 --> 01:22:22.404
TIME AGAIN THE ANALYSIS.

01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:24.205
OF THOSE PROGRAMS BUT IF YOU SEE

01:22:24.272 --> 01:22:25.674
HAVE SHOWN THAT WE'RE NOT

01:22:25.740 --> 01:22:27.809
GETTING THE RETURN FOR THE

01:22:27.876 --> 01:22:28.843
DOLLAR THAT WE COULD WE'RE NOT

01:22:28.910 --> 01:22:30.779
MAXIMIZING THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY

01:22:30.845 --> 01:22:32.547
RETURN THAT WE COULD BE GETTING.

01:22:32.614 --> 01:22:34.516
AND ONE OF THE TOP REASONS THAT

01:22:34.582 --> 01:22:38.620
THEY HAVE PINPOINTED IS BECAUSE

01:22:38.687 --> 01:22:40.622
OF IT -- SHODDY OR INAPPROPRIATE

01:22:40.689 --> 01:22:41.856
INSTALLATIONS OR INSTALLATIONS

01:22:41.923 --> 01:22:42.891
THAT ARE DONE IN A WAY THAT

01:22:42.957 --> 01:22:44.859
MAXIMIZE THE EFFICIENCIES THAT

01:22:44.926 --> 01:22:46.127
COULD BE OBTAINED.

01:22:46.194 --> 01:22:48.730
SO WITH THIS BILL DOES IS WOULD

01:22:48.797 --> 01:22:51.533
APPLY ON JUST PROJECTS OF FIFTY

01:22:51.599 --> 01:22:52.567
THOUSAND DOLLARS OR GREATER

01:22:52.634 --> 01:22:54.369
RICHARD LARGE.

01:22:54.436 --> 01:22:56.671
COMMERCIAL PROJECTS --

01:22:56.738 --> 01:22:58.373
PREVAILING WAGE AND A

01:22:58.440 --> 01:22:59.541
REQUIREMENT THAT THAT THAT THAT

01:22:59.607 --> 01:23:02.010
THE WORK FORCE BE A SKILLED THAT

01:23:02.077 --> 01:23:03.678
CONTRACTORS TO DO THE THAT LARGE

01:23:03.745 --> 01:23:04.612
SCALE WORK.

01:23:04.679 --> 01:23:06.147
HAVE A SKILLED AND TRAINED

01:23:06.214 --> 01:23:08.450
WORKFORCE -- WE THINK IT'S A

01:23:08.516 --> 01:23:10.085
REASONABLE COMPROMISE WERE YOU

01:23:10.151 --> 01:23:12.821
KNOW OBVIOUSLY PROJECTS A FIFTY

01:23:12.887 --> 01:23:14.189
THOUSAND DOLLARS OR MORE ARE

01:23:14.255 --> 01:23:15.824
VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE.

01:23:15.890 --> 01:23:18.493
LESS THAN FIVE I THINK WAS

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:19.427
LISTEN TO THAT WELL I WON MISS

01:23:19.494 --> 01:23:20.895
WHAT I THINK IS LESS THAN 5% OF

01:23:20.962 --> 01:23:22.530
THE PROJECTS.

01:23:22.597 --> 01:23:23.098
I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY MUCH

01:23:23.164 --> 01:23:23.765
SMALLER THAN THAT.

01:23:23.832 --> 01:23:24.899

SOPHISTICATED PROJECTS THAT

01:23:44.753 --> 01:23:48.289
REQUIRE A SOPHISTICATED

01:23:48.356 --> 01:23:49.991
WORKFORCE.

01:23:50.058 --> 01:23:51.192

OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF HAS BEEN

01:24:30.965 --> 01:24:32.267
WONDERFUL BUT WORKING ON

THE CURRENT -- AMENDMENTS ON THE

DISAPPEAR.

01:25:00.195 --> 01:25:00.795
ENTIRELY BECAUSE THE COST OF THE

01:25:00.862 --> 01:25:01.596
PROJECT IS GREATER THAN THE

01:25:01.663 --> 01:25:02.730

A 1100% NET REALIZATION RATE IS

01:25:33.261 --> 01:25:34.896
SOUNDING FAMILIAR FOR PURPOSES

01:25:34.963 --> 01:25:36.898

01:26:10.565 --> 01:26:12.734
ANALYSIS.

01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:13.735
SO THIS DOES NOT CAPTURE THE

01:26:13.801 --> 01:26:15.737
SPIRIT OF THE AMENDMENTS IN THE

01:26:15.803 --> 01:26:17.972

THE COMEDIAN ALICE'S REFLECTS

01:26:20.875 --> 01:26:23.444
WHAT WOULD BE THE INCREASED COST

01:26:23.511 --> 01:26:25.580
THAT WOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH

01:26:25.647 --> 01:26:27.382
THE WORK FORCE REQUIREMENT.

01:26:27.448 --> 01:26:29.784
IN WOULD ALLOW FOR COSTS

01:26:29.851 --> 01:26:32.687
JUDGMENT BASED ON THAT.

01:26:32.754 --> 01:26:34.389

THAT BEEN REVIEWED BY THE CHAIR.

01:26:45.733 --> 01:26:47.936
OKAY -- THAT WAS A COMPROMISE I

01:26:48.002 --> 01:26:48.870
WAS HOPING WE COULD LAND ON IT

01:26:48.937 --> 01:26:51.039
WAS GOOD WITH THE PROPONENTS AND

THE OPPONENTS HERE TODAY -- SO I

01:26:54.175 --> 01:26:54.876
DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO DO

01:26:54.943 --> 01:26:57.312

I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

01:27:06.721 --> 01:27:07.622
SEEMS.

01:27:07.689 --> 01:27:08.356
FOR TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH THE

SAME GOAL THAT WE'RE ALL WORKING

01:27:09.891 --> 01:27:12.427
TOWARDS BUT I THINK WE TAKES

01:27:12.493 --> 01:27:13.928
MORE CONVERSATION BUT WE

01:27:13.995 --> 01:27:15.530
CERTAINLY ARE COMFORTABLE WITH

I MEAN I'M I'M A LITTLE

01:27:20.034 --> 01:27:20.668
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH.

01:27:20.735 --> 01:27:22.637
SORT OF AN AUDIBLE ON THE LINE

01:27:22.704 --> 01:27:23.571
WHERE WE HAVE NOT HAD AN

01:27:23.638 --> 01:27:25.340
OPPORTUNITY TO I'M SO SORRY I

01:27:25.406 --> 01:27:26.808

WE HAD THAT LANGUAGE.

01:27:33.348 --> 01:27:35.049
I THINK WE'RE GOOD WITH WHAT'S

01:27:35.116 --> 01:27:37.218
IN FRONT OF US -- BUT I MEAN I

01:27:37.285 --> 01:27:38.086

01:27:38.152 --> 01:27:41.422

ARE IN THESE LARGE PROJECTS.

01:29:56.524 --> 01:29:57.558
AND FOR EXAMPLE IF IT'S A

01:29:57.625 --> 01:29:59.093
REFINERY I'M PRETTY SURE THAT'S

01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:01.596
GOING TO BE UNION LABOR ALREADY.

01:30:01.662 --> 01:30:03.397
MANY OF THESE PROJECTS WILL BE

01:30:03.464 --> 01:30:04.398
UNION LABOR.

01:30:04.465 --> 01:30:06.200
CAN YOU DEFINE SOME OF THE

01:30:06.267 --> 01:30:08.169

SOME OF A RECORD I CAN TELL YOU

THAT IF IF MY MEMORY SERVES ME

01:30:16.144 --> 01:30:16.344
CORRECT.

01:30:16.410 --> 01:30:19.080
THE IT'S IT'S ROOM A ONE ROUND

01:30:19.147 --> 01:30:22.183
2% OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF

01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:23.584
PROJECTS GO TO THESE LARGE

01:30:23.651 --> 01:30:24.919
COMMERCIAL PRIZE THAT'S FROM THE

01:30:24.986 --> 01:30:27.588
SENATE ENERGY COMMITTEE NOW SAYS

01:30:27.655 --> 01:30:29.157
IF I RECALL CORRECTLY -- SO IT

01:30:29.223 --> 01:30:32.894
WOULD DEPEND ON YOU KNOW WHAT.

01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:34.929
WHAT -- YOU KNOW MARKET YOU'RE

01:30:34.996 --> 01:30:36.297
TALKING ABOUT.

01:30:36.364 --> 01:30:38.866
THE VAST MAJORITY OF OF THIS

01:30:38.933 --> 01:30:40.501
TYPE OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY WORK

01:30:40.568 --> 01:30:42.403
ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE IN IS

01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:43.805
BEING DONE.

01:30:43.871 --> 01:30:45.807
WITH CONTRACTORS THAT TYPICALLY

01:30:45.873 --> 01:30:46.908
WOULD BE.

01:30:46.974 --> 01:30:48.776
UNIONIZED CONTRACTORS IN THE BAY

01:30:48.843 --> 01:30:50.344
AREA MOST OF ALL THE BAY AREA

01:30:50.411 --> 01:30:51.712
AND FRESNO IN.

01:30:51.779 --> 01:30:54.515
IN -- IN LOS ANGELES IN SAN

01:30:54.582 --> 01:30:55.716
DIEGO IN PLACES LIKE THAT THERE

01:30:55.783 --> 01:30:56.851
MAY BE SOME OTHER PLACES WHERE

01:30:56.918 --> 01:31:00.354
THEY WOULDN'T BE -- BUT TO THE

01:31:00.421 --> 01:31:02.490
AMENDMENT I THOUGHT THAT THE

01:31:02.557 --> 01:31:04.058
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS.

01:31:04.125 --> 01:31:05.726
GOT TO THE HEART OF THIS ISSUE I

01:31:05.793 --> 01:31:08.062
THINK IT'S A VERY SLIGHT

01:31:08.129 --> 01:31:09.463
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO AND

01:31:09.530 --> 01:31:11.899
WE'RE WE THINK THAT THE

01:31:11.966 --> 01:31:12.834
COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES.

01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:17.438
GETS TO THE POINT -- BUT THAT'S

01:31:17.505 --> 01:31:20.007
YOU CANNOT I'M HAPPY TO WORK

01:31:20.074 --> 01:31:23.778
WITH YOU MISTER CHAIR ON TRYING --

01:31:23.845 --> 01:31:25.313
TO MARY THESE BECAUSE I DON'T

01:31:25.379 --> 01:31:26.881
THINK WE'RE THAT FAR OFF FROM

01:31:26.948 --> 01:31:29.150
THE THE WORD SMITHING THAT THE

01:31:29.217 --> 01:31:30.585
OPPOSITION WAS CONCERNED WITH

01:31:30.651 --> 01:31:32.220
AND STILL FEELING THE INTENT OF

01:31:32.286 --> 01:31:33.754
THE COMMITTEES ANALYSIS WHICH

01:31:33.821 --> 01:31:36.190
WAS ABOUT. TO REITERATE FOR

01:31:36.257 --> 01:31:37.491
THOSE FOLLOWING ALONG IN THIS IN

01:31:37.558 --> 01:31:38.860
THE WEEDS HERE.

01:31:38.926 --> 01:31:40.094
I THINK THAT THE COMMITTEE

01:31:40.161 --> 01:31:41.529
HOUSES PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION

01:31:41.596 --> 01:31:43.364
ANY ADDITIONAL LABOR COSTS THIS

01:31:43.431 --> 01:31:44.932
IS YOUR LINE RESULTING FROM THE

01:31:44.999 --> 01:31:46.167
USE WAS SKILLED AND TRAINED

01:31:46.234 --> 01:31:47.568
WORKFORCE.

01:31:47.635 --> 01:31:48.703
IN ACCORDANCE WITH.

01:31:48.769 --> 01:31:50.438
CERTAIN CHAPTERS SHALL BE

01:31:50.504 --> 01:31:51.973
EXCLUDED FROM THE PROJECT COSTS

01:31:52.039 --> 01:31:53.741
OF THE COMMISSION'S COST

01:31:53.808 --> 01:31:55.376
EFFECTIVENESS TESTS.

01:31:55.443 --> 01:31:57.411
I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE NOW SAYS.

01:31:57.478 --> 01:31:59.480
WHAT I JUST MENTIONED IS THAT?

01:31:59.547 --> 01:32:02.049
THEY'RE PRESUMED TO HAVE A 1100%

01:32:02.116 --> 01:32:03.885
NET REALIZATIONRATE FOR THE

01:32:03.951 --> 01:32:05.219
PURPOSES OF THE COST

01:32:05.286 --> 01:32:06.587
EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSES.

01:32:06.654 --> 01:32:08.322
AND THE DETERMINATION OF AND USE

01:32:08.389 --> 01:32:09.857
CONSUMER OR CONTRACTOR

01:32:09.924 --> 01:32:11.525
INCENTIVES SO I THINK IT'S SORT

01:32:11.592 --> 01:32:12.426
OF ON THAT.

01:32:12.493 --> 01:32:16.297
THAT PIECE OF IT -- SO I'M OPEN

01:32:16.364 --> 01:32:17.765
TO WORKING THAT THROUGH I JUST

01:32:17.832 --> 01:32:19.901
LIKE THE LANDED WELL.

01:32:19.967 --> 01:32:21.135
WE'LL LET ME LET ME JUST SAY.

01:32:21.202 --> 01:32:23.971
AND I APPRECIATE THE THE EFFORT

01:32:24.038 --> 01:32:25.740
AT THIS POINT TO TRY TO TO

01:32:25.806 --> 01:32:27.775
FIGURE OUT HOW TO BRING TO MARRY

01:32:27.842 --> 01:32:29.143
THE TWO BUT I THINK THAT THE

01:32:29.210 --> 01:32:31.279
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS -- WAS VERY

01:32:31.345 --> 01:32:33.347
THOROUGH VERY COMPLETE BASED ON

01:32:33.414 --> 01:32:34.815
UNDERSTANDING THE DYNAMICS IN

01:32:34.882 --> 01:32:36.350
FRONT OF US THAT IT ALSO IN.

01:32:36.417 --> 01:32:38.252
VAULT COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE P.

01:32:38.319 --> 01:32:41.022
YOU SEE -- AND SO THIS ANALYSIS

01:32:41.088 --> 01:32:43.724
HAS BEEN BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH A

01:32:43.791 --> 01:32:45.826
LOT OF CARE AND I THINK

01:32:45.893 --> 01:32:48.062
THOUGHTFULNESS AND SO -- WE'LL

01:32:48.129 --> 01:32:51.065
HAVE IT MY RECOMMENDATION IS --

THE MOST CRITICAL PIECES IN OUR

01:52:04.984 --> 01:52:07.120
MIND WAS THE INDEPENDENT

01:52:07.187 --> 01:52:08.655

THIS LEGISLATION IS

01:52:26.773 --> 01:52:28.475
VERY AGGRESSIVE BROWN WHAT

01:52:30.076 --> 01:52:32.779
WHAT ENSURES US THREE YEARS FOR

01:52:32.846 --> 01:52:34.013
FIVE YEARS SIX YEARS FROM NOW

01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:35.381

TOGETHER A DEPARTMENT AND A

01:52:39.185 --> 01:52:41.888
CERTIFICATION ANNA PROCESS WITH

01:52:41.955 --> 01:52:43.923
WITH VERY WITH PEOPLE WITH THOSE

01:52:43.990 --> 01:52:45.425
TALENTS TO ENSURE THAT

01:52:45.492 --> 01:52:47.227
MEASUREMENT CONTINUES AND IT

01:52:47.293 --> 01:52:48.761
ISN'T SOMETHING THAT JUST

01:52:48.828 --> 01:52:49.863
HAPPENS IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS.

01:52:49.929 --> 01:52:51.131
AND THAT'S BEEN THE PAST IT'S

01:52:51.197 --> 01:52:52.265
BEEN IN PLACE.

01:52:52.332 --> 01:52:54.000
WE BELIEVE THAT IS A CRITICAL

01:52:54.067 --> 01:52:55.768
PIECE WE HAVE READ IT.

01:52:55.835 --> 01:52:57.070
WE'VE MET WITH THE GOVERNOR WITH

01:52:57.137 --> 01:52:58.771
THAT WITH THE STAFF WE'VE TALKED

01:52:58.838 --> 01:53:00.039
EACH OF YOU COLLECTIVELY.

01:53:00.106 --> 01:53:02.142
WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT WITH THAT

01:53:02.208 --> 01:53:03.576
IN PLACE.

01:53:03.643 --> 01:53:05.778
WE WILL BE MUCH MORE ASSURED

01:53:05.845 --> 01:53:06.746
THAT THE DEVASTATIONS THAT WE

01:53:06.813 --> 01:53:09.082
SAW IN THOSE BIG FOR FIRES WILL

01:53:09.149 --> 01:53:10.950
BE LESS DEVASTATION LESS

01:53:11.017 --> 01:53:12.118
IMPACTED TO HAPPEN.

01:53:12.185 --> 01:53:13.052
THAT'S THE FIRST THE MOST

01:53:13.119 --> 01:53:14.854
IMPORTANT PIECE WITH THAT FIVE

01:53:14.921 --> 01:53:20.493
BILLION DOLLARS FOR SAFETY WITH

01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:22.595
CLEAR STANDARDS WITHIN IT. EIGHT

01:53:22.662 --> 01:53:22.829
PAIRS.

01:53:22.896 --> 01:53:24.330
VERY COMPLICATED AND ANALYSIS --

01:53:24.397 --> 01:53:25.865
BUT THERE ARE FOUR FIVE

01:53:25.932 --> 01:53:27.567
DIFFERENT FACTORS ARE THE CHANGE

01:53:27.634 --> 01:53:28.301
IT.

01:53:28.368 --> 01:53:30.570
BUT IF YOU DO PASSED IF YOU

01:53:30.637 --> 01:53:32.205
DON'T PASS THIS.

01:53:32.272 --> 01:53:33.740
THEN IT'LL BE SUBSTANTIAL

01:53:33.806 --> 01:53:35.441
INCREASES FOR REPAIRS OUR

01:53:35.508 --> 01:53:37.443
ANALYSIS IS WE HEARD FROM A

01:53:37.510 --> 01:53:39.412
BERKELEY PROFESSOR -- AND SENATE

01:53:39.479 --> 01:53:42.015
UTILITIES IS A SUBSTANTIAL

01:53:42.081 --> 01:53:43.349
SAVINGS FOR P. JEANNIE AND

01:53:43.416 --> 01:53:45.351
EDISON CUSTOMERS WITH THE

01:53:45.418 --> 01:53:46.686
PASSAGE OF AB.

01:53:46.753 --> 01:53:47.253
TEN FIFTY FOR A WEEK TO WALK

01:53:47.320 --> 01:53:49.189
THROUGH THE FOUR FIVE WAYS IT

01:53:49.255 --> 01:53:50.390
GETS THERE.

01:53:50.456 --> 01:53:52.058
AND IT'S IN THIS IS A SOON TO BE

01:53:52.125 --> 01:53:53.893
THE W. R. CAPITALIZATION AS AN

01:53:53.960 --> 01:53:58.598
INCREASE NOT AS A CONTINUATION.

01:53:58.665 --> 01:54:00.466
AND IT'S FOR IT.

01:54:00.533 --> 01:54:01.401
IN A DIFFERENT FACTORS IT'S

01:54:01.467 --> 01:54:02.835
PROBABLY NEUTRAL TO A SLIGHT

01:54:02.902 --> 01:54:04.103
INCREASE FOR EDISON CUSTOMERS

01:54:04.170 --> 01:54:06.272
SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE FLOOD.

01:54:06.339 --> 01:54:08.942
DECREASE AND FEES FOR MOST OF

01:54:09.008 --> 01:54:10.176
THOSE -- CUSTOMERS.

01:54:10.243 --> 01:54:12.812
IN REGARDS TO VICTIMS -- THERE

01:54:12.879 --> 01:54:14.280
ARE THREE AREAS THAT IT HELPS

01:54:14.347 --> 01:54:17.150
VICTIMS PROVIDES MAJOR LEVERAGE

01:54:17.217 --> 01:54:18.651
IN OUR NEGOTIATIONS WITH P.

01:54:18.718 --> 01:54:21.287
JEANNIE AND SOME LEVERAGE IN THE

01:54:21.354 --> 01:54:22.488
NEGOTIATIONS WITH THAT ISN'T.

01:54:22.555 --> 01:54:24.657
THE FIRST PIECE IN IT IS THAT IT

01:54:24.724 --> 01:54:27.227
HAS I AM GOING.

01:54:27.293 --> 01:54:27.961
TO ASK THAT.

01:54:28.027 --> 01:54:30.430
WE WE GET TO A CONCLUSION.

01:57:46.392 --> 01:57:48.594

02:04:53.452 --> 02:04:55.754
IS I THINK EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS

RATES ARE GOING UP -- AND THEY

02:04:57.623 --> 02:04:58.991

02:05:01.126 --> 02:05:02.828
UNTENABLE AND SO I THINK A LOT

02:05:02.895 --> 02:05:03.963
OF CREDIT DOES NEED TO GO TO THE

02:05:09.568 --> 02:05:11.737
HOWEVER LARGE ENERGY CONSUMERS

02:05:11.804 --> 02:05:13.706
THAT TAKE THEIR POWER A

02:05:13.772 --> 02:05:15.474

02:05:15.541 --> 02:05:16.775

HAVE THE RATE INCREASE.

02:05:23.515 --> 02:05:25.150
AND SO WE THINK THERE ARE MANY

02:05:25.217 --> 02:05:27.853
COMMON SENSE APPROACHES THAT

02:05:27.920 --> 02:05:29.054

I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN THAT

02:12:55.367 --> 02:12:56.368
LITIGATION EVER SENSE.

02:12:56.435 --> 02:12:57.636
BUT WAS PART OF THE TEAM THAT

02:12:57.703 --> 02:12:58.837
TRIED THE CASE.

02:12:58.904 --> 02:13:01.073
IN JANUARY TWENTY SEVENTEEN IN

02:13:01.139 --> 02:13:02.240
WHICH WE WERE ABLE TO SHOW.

02:13:02.307 --> 02:13:04.743
THAT S. TGT WAS NOT PRUDENT AND

02:13:04.810 --> 02:13:06.144
STARTING THE FIRES I'VE NEVER

02:13:06.211 --> 02:13:07.746

FOCUSED [inaudible]

02:13:18.323 --> 02:13:19.658
NUMBER.

02:13:19.725 --> 02:13:20.325
ONE THE CHANGE IN THE PERMANENCY

02:13:20.392 --> 02:13:22.227
ROLE.

02:13:22.294 --> 02:13:24.096
THE DISCUSSION ON THE PRUDENT TO

02:13:24.162 --> 02:13:26.698
ROLL I THINK HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT

02:13:26.765 --> 02:13:28.266
UNINFORMED BY ALL OF US.

02:13:28.333 --> 02:13:30.736
THE REAL CHANGE IS NOT ABOUT THE

02:13:30.802 --> 02:13:32.504
BURDEN OF PROOF.

02:13:32.571 --> 02:13:35.140
THE REAL CHANGE IS ABOUT WHETHER

02:13:35.207 --> 02:13:36.575
THE PRINCE WHO RULED.

02:13:36.641 --> 02:13:38.777
WILL BE PRUDENCE IN THE SENSE

02:13:38.844 --> 02:13:40.278
THAT THE UTILITY WAS PRUDENT

02:13:40.345 --> 02:13:42.514
WHEN THEY SETTLED THE CASE.

02:13:42.581 --> 02:13:44.449
AND THEREFORE THAT SATISFIES THE

02:13:44.516 --> 02:13:46.284
PRINCE TO RULE.

02:13:46.351 --> 02:13:48.286
OR WILL IT BE PRUDENCE IN THE

02:13:48.353 --> 02:13:49.721
SENSE THAT THEY WILL BE ASSESSED

02:13:49.788 --> 02:13:51.123
IN WHETHER THEY WERE PRUDENT AND

02:13:51.189 --> 02:13:53.525
THE WAY THAT THEY MAINTAINED AND

02:13:53.592 --> 02:13:54.693
OPERATED THEIR SYSTEM.

02:13:54.760 --> 02:13:56.194
NOW YOU MIGHT THINK WELL YOU

02:13:56.261 --> 02:13:57.329
KNOW HOW COULD I MAKE SUCH A

02:13:57.396 --> 02:13:59.931
STATEMENT BUT OF CURRENTLY.

02:13:59.998 --> 02:14:01.433
WE ARE BEFORE THE UNITED STATES

02:14:01.500 --> 02:14:03.168
SUPREME COURT ALL THE UTILITIES

02:14:03.235 --> 02:14:05.203
ON THIS ISSUE OR BEFORE THE

02:14:05.270 --> 02:14:06.671
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT.

02:14:06.738 --> 02:14:10.375
SDG AN A IN THEIR FILING ON PAGE

02:14:10.442 --> 02:14:11.877
EIGHT OF THEIR PETITION FOR CERT.

02:14:11.943 --> 02:14:15.680
SAID IN REFERRING TO FOR THAT

02:14:15.747 --> 02:14:17.115
FIRST HELD THAT RECOVERY.

02:14:17.182 --> 02:14:18.917
OF WILDFIRE COSTS.

02:14:18.984 --> 02:14:22.454
WAS WARRANTED WITHOUT REGARD TO

02:14:22.521 --> 02:14:25.424
THE PRUDENCE OF ESTY GENIES

02:14:25.490 --> 02:14:27.959
MAINTENANCE OPERATIONS.

02:14:28.026 --> 02:14:30.195
THAT THE WORDS SDG NAY OF THE

02:14:30.262 --> 02:14:32.130
UTILITIES TAKE THE POSITION.

02:14:32.197 --> 02:14:33.865
THAT.

02:14:33.932 --> 02:14:34.699
GOOD NEWS AS TO HOW THEY WERE

02:14:34.766 --> 02:14:36.234
OPERATING FACILITIES.

02:14:36.301 --> 02:14:38.770
IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS

02:14:38.837 --> 02:14:40.172
REQUIRED FOR THEM TO SHOW.

02:14:40.238 --> 02:14:42.107
IN THE CURRENT BILL IF YOU LOOK

02:14:42.174 --> 02:14:44.910
AT THE CURRENT BILL SECTION.

02:14:44.976 --> 02:14:45.510
SIX AND YOU LOOK DOWN AND YOU

02:14:45.577 --> 02:14:46.344
READ.

02:14:46.411 --> 02:14:48.280
IT'S THE TALKS ABOUT ELECTRICAL

02:14:48.346 --> 02:14:50.649
CORPORATIONS CONDUCT.

02:14:50.715 --> 02:14:52.317
NOW THE WORDS THE PRUDENCE

02:14:52.384 --> 02:14:53.785
EQUATION.

02:14:53.852 --> 02:14:55.020
FOCUSES ON THE ELECTRICAL

02:14:55.086 --> 02:14:56.855
CORPORATIONS CONDUCT IT DOESN'T

02:14:56.922 --> 02:14:59.357
SAY CONDUCT IN CONNECTION WITH

02:14:59.424 --> 02:15:01.126
ITS ROLE IN IGNITING THE FIRE

02:15:01.193 --> 02:15:03.728
AND IF YOU NOTICE AT ANOTHER

02:15:03.795 --> 02:15:04.830
LOCATION IN THE BILL.

02:15:04.896 --> 02:15:07.232
THEY TALK ABOUT IT NATION.

02:15:07.299 --> 02:15:09.234
BUT HERE THEY TALK ABOUT CONDUCT

02:15:09.301 --> 02:15:10.735
SO ONE CONCERN I HAVE IS THAT

02:15:10.802 --> 02:15:11.770
THERE NEEDS TO BE A

02:15:11.837 --> 02:15:13.438
CLARIFICATION IN THE BILL.

02:15:13.505 --> 02:15:15.974
NUMBER TWO YOU CAN NOT AT THE

02:15:16.041 --> 02:15:18.677
LEGISLATIVE LEVEL EXTEND THE

02:15:18.743 --> 02:15:20.645
SURCHARGE WHICH WAS IMPLEMENTED

02:15:20.712 --> 02:15:21.246
TO COVER.

02:15:21.313 --> 02:15:23.849
THE MANIPULATED PRICES BACK IN

02:15:23.915 --> 02:15:25.283
TWO THOUSAND AND ONE THAT WAS

02:15:25.350 --> 02:15:27.819
THE CPUC PROCEEDING YOU CAN YOU

02:15:27.886 --> 02:15:30.322
CAN ENTITLE THE CPUC. TO START A

02:15:30.388 --> 02:15:32.958
PROCEEDING TO DO THE EXTENSION.

02:15:33.024 --> 02:15:34.292
BUT THE RATE PAYERS HAVE AN

02:15:34.359 --> 02:15:36.194
ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN

02:15:36.261 --> 02:15:38.129
THAT PROCESS BECAUSE YOU'RE

02:15:38.196 --> 02:15:39.130
SETTING RATES.

02:15:39.197 --> 02:15:40.866
IF YOU DON'T DO THAT THEN THAT

02:15:40.932 --> 02:15:42.634
WOULD BE IN MY JUDGMENT TO BE

02:15:42.701 --> 02:15:43.668
CONSIDERED A TAKING.

02:15:43.735 --> 02:15:46.905
LAST POINT.

02:15:46.972 --> 02:15:49.708
ALL FOCUS SHOULD BE ON STOPPING

02:15:49.774 --> 02:15:51.877
THE WILD FIRES PERIOD.

02:15:51.943 --> 02:15:54.079
IF YOU READ THIS LOSS AND OR IF

02:15:54.145 --> 02:15:54.713
YOU READ THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

02:15:54.779 --> 02:15:55.614
TODAY.

02:15:55.680 --> 02:15:57.582
THERE'S A DEVASTATING FRONT PAGE

02:15:57.649 --> 02:15:59.551
STORY THAT MAKES THE CASE.

02:15:59.618 --> 02:16:02.187
THAT P. JEANNIE HAS KNOWN FOR A

02:16:02.254 --> 02:16:04.256
LONG TIME AND HAS IGNORED THE

02:16:04.322 --> 02:16:05.223
FACT.

02:16:05.290 --> 02:16:07.859
THAT THEIR POWER LINES ARE IN

02:16:07.926 --> 02:16:09.494
HORRIBLE SHAPE.

02:16:09.561 --> 02:16:11.129
THAT THEY ARE OUTMODED AND THEY

02:16:11.196 --> 02:16:12.330
NEEDED TO BE REPAIRED AT THE

02:16:12.397 --> 02:16:13.431
FRONT PAGE STORY IN THE WALL

02:16:13.498 --> 02:16:14.633
STREET JOURNAL.

02:16:14.699 --> 02:16:16.768
MY SUGGESTION.

02:16:16.835 --> 02:16:18.737
AN ALTERNATIVE SUGGESTION.

02:16:18.803 --> 02:16:20.939
IS THAT YOUR COMMITTEE DEVELOP.

02:16:21.006 --> 02:16:23.341
VERY PRECISE FACTUAL

02:16:23.408 --> 02:16:25.310
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT BREAKDOWNS

02:16:25.377 --> 02:16:26.945
IN THE MANAGEMENT AT THE

02:16:27.012 --> 02:16:27.946
UTILITIES.

02:16:28.013 --> 02:16:30.215
WHAT BREAKDOWN ACTUALLY RESULTED

02:16:30.282 --> 02:16:31.816
IN THE CAUSING OF FIRES?

02:16:31.883 --> 02:16:33.952
AND THAT YOU ADDRESS THOSE

02:16:34.019 --> 02:16:36.021
MANAGEMENT SHORTFALLS WITH VERY

02:16:36.087 --> 02:16:37.188
SPECIFIC.

02:16:37.255 --> 02:16:39.691
NEW RULES NUMBER TWO THE TO

02:16:39.758 --> 02:16:41.860
EXPAND THE EXISTING SAFETY

02:16:41.927 --> 02:16:43.395
ENFORCEMENT AT CEBU CITY THEY

02:16:43.461 --> 02:16:45.096
HAVE GREAT PEOPLE.

02:16:45.163 --> 02:16:48.466
IN SAFETY ENFORCEMENT AT CPUC.

02:16:48.533 --> 02:16:49.634
BUT THEY DON'T HAVE EXPANDED

02:16:49.701 --> 02:16:51.136
STATUS.

02:16:51.202 --> 02:16:52.637
THEY DON'T HAVE MONEY.

02:16:52.704 --> 02:16:56.041
YOU DON'T NEED ANY MORE RULES.

02:16:56.107 --> 02:16:58.143
GENERAL ORDER NINETY FIVE IS A

02:16:58.209 --> 02:17:00.946
VERY PRECISE SET OF RULES THAT

02:17:01.012 --> 02:17:01.947
HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED

02:17:02.013 --> 02:17:07.852
PAINSTAKINGLY BY THE CPUC SINCE.

02:17:07.919 --> 02:17:08.486
NINETEEN THIRTEEN THEY ARE VERY

02:17:08.553 --> 02:17:10.855
PRECISE WHEN WE WHEN WE SHOW

02:17:10.922 --> 02:17:12.924
THAT SDG ESTY GINNY DID NOT.

02:17:12.991 --> 02:17:14.859
ACT PRUDENTLY WE DID THAT BY

02:17:14.926 --> 02:17:15.927
SHOWING THEY SPECIFICALLY

02:17:15.994 --> 02:17:18.897
VIOLATED PRECISE PROVISIONS OF

02:17:18.964 --> 02:17:20.165
GENERAL ORDER.

02:17:20.231 --> 02:17:20.765
NINETY FIVE WHAT YOU'RE DOING

02:17:20.832 --> 02:17:22.033
NOW CLOSE HERE WHAT YOU'RE DOING

02:17:22.100 --> 02:17:23.969
WITH THIS BILL.

02:17:24.035 --> 02:17:25.370
IS YOUR GIVING ALL THE

02:17:25.437 --> 02:17:27.038
INCENTIVES TO HAVE MORE WILD

02:17:27.105 --> 02:17:28.506
FIRES.

02:17:28.573 --> 02:17:29.975
MY ESTIMATED YOU'RE TALKING

02:17:30.041 --> 02:17:32.811
BETWEEN 200-252-20050 BILLION

02:17:32.877 --> 02:17:34.112
DOLLARS.

02:17:34.179 --> 02:17:37.115
OF MORE WILDFIRE COSTS WHICH

02:17:37.182 --> 02:17:39.017
WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE BECOME AN

02:17:39.084 --> 02:17:40.318
OBLIGATION OF THE STATE OF

02:17:40.385 --> 02:17:41.486
CALIFORNIA.

02:17:41.553 --> 02:17:43.254
BECAUSE THEY WILL BE ROLLED INTO

02:17:43.321 --> 02:17:45.023
BONDS THE THE STATE OF

02:17:45.090 --> 02:17:46.124
CALIFORNIA THROUGH THE

02:17:46.191 --> 02:17:47.592
DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES

02:17:47.659 --> 02:17:51.129
WILL BE REQUIRED TO STAND BEHIND.

02:17:51.196 --> 02:17:52.397
AND THAT WILL BRING INTO

02:17:52.464 --> 02:17:54.933
QUESTION JUST LIKE IT DID BEFORE.

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:56.568
THE CREDIT RATING OF THE STATE

02:17:56.635 --> 02:17:57.936
OF CALIFORNIA.

02:17:58.003 --> 02:18:00.739
SO MY SUGGESTION TO USE I THINK

MITIGATING FIRE RISKS.

02:21:20.238 --> 02:21:22.073
THIS PROVIDES THEM WITH THE

02:21:22.140 --> 02:21:24.108
ABILITY TO BACK AWAY FROM THEIR

02:21:24.175 --> 02:21:25.043

MONTHS LONG PROCESS OF

02:25:07.932 --> 02:25:08.499
DELIBERATION STAKEHOLDER

02:25:08.566 --> 02:25:09.233

PROTECTS THE WORKERS WHICH I

02:25:15.006 --> 02:25:16.874
THINK IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT.

02:25:16.941 --> 02:25:18.376
I THINK IT STABILIZES THE I. O.

02:25:18.443 --> 02:25:20.244
U.'S WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT THING

02:25:20.311 --> 02:25:22.080
TO DO AT THIS POINT -- AND THIS

02:25:22.146 --> 02:25:23.815
JUNCTURE AND WE'RE ALL TRYING TO

02:25:23.881 --> 02:25:25.716
MAKE THE BEST OF A BAD SITUATION

02:25:25.783 --> 02:25:26.551
THAT NONE OF US.

02:25:26.617 --> 02:25:27.752
BECAUSE THEN I THINK THIS IS A

02:25:27.819 --> 02:25:29.887
VALIANT EFFORT I WANTED TO FOCUS

02:25:29.954 --> 02:25:31.722
A LITTLE BIT ON AND AND GET THE

02:25:31.789 --> 02:25:32.657
AUTHORS.

02:25:32.723 --> 02:25:34.192
RESPONSES ON SOME POINTS RAISED

02:25:34.258 --> 02:25:37.528
BY THE OPPOSITION WITH RESPECT --

02:25:37.595 --> 02:25:38.896
TO THE WHAT I BELIEVE IS CALLED

02:25:38.963 --> 02:25:40.698
THE PRUDENT MANAGER STANDARD AND

02:25:40.765 --> 02:25:43.901
HOW THAT WORKS WITH THE BILL

02:25:43.968 --> 02:25:44.769
BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING

02:25:44.836 --> 02:25:45.069
[inaudible]

02:25:45.136 --> 02:25:46.304
IS THAT.

02:25:46.370 --> 02:25:47.672
FINALLY WE HAVE A BIG INCENTIVE

02:25:47.738 --> 02:25:49.073
PROBLEM WITH THE I'VE USE

02:25:49.140 --> 02:25:54.745
BECAUSE OF WEATHER AND I WOULD.

02:25:54.812 --> 02:25:55.346
PASCAL LOOKED THE WALL STREET

02:25:55.413 --> 02:25:57.315
JOURNAL A EITHER YESTERDAY OR

02:25:57.381 --> 02:25:59.083
TODAY THAT SAID PEACHY NEEDS.

02:25:59.150 --> 02:26:00.885
UNDER INVESTED IN SAFETY.

02:26:00.952 --> 02:26:02.954
IN A BIG WAY AND THAT'S THE

02:26:03.020 --> 02:26:03.821
WALLSTREET JOURNAL.

02:26:03.888 --> 02:26:06.290
OKAY SO WHEN THESE CATASTROPHIC

02:26:06.357 --> 02:26:08.359
WILDFIRES HAPPENING AND AND

02:26:08.426 --> 02:26:11.395
COULD TAKE LIVES AND PROPERTY IN

02:26:11.462 --> 02:26:12.763
COST US ALL.

02:26:12.830 --> 02:26:14.198
COST BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THOSE

02:26:14.265 --> 02:26:16.601
THOSE IMMEDIATELY PUSHED I OWE

02:26:16.667 --> 02:26:18.569
YOU ANY GIVEN I'LL YOU P.

02:26:18.636 --> 02:26:20.104
JEANNIE OR ANYBODY.

02:26:20.171 --> 02:26:20.872
IN THE INSOLVENCY.

02:26:20.938 --> 02:26:23.474
SO WE'VE GOT TO CREATE A PATH TO

02:26:23.541 --> 02:26:24.375
MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE

02:26:24.442 --> 02:26:26.344
INCENTIVIZE TO INVEST IN

02:26:26.410 --> 02:26:28.045
HARDENING THE SYSTEM AND I THINK

02:26:28.112 --> 02:26:29.747
THIS BILL DOES THAT AND I THINK

02:26:29.814 --> 02:26:31.349
THE WAY IT DOES IT.

02:26:31.415 --> 02:26:32.550
IS BY SAYING THAT.

02:26:32.617 --> 02:26:33.651
YOU HAVE TO GET A SAFETY

02:26:33.718 --> 02:26:35.386
CERTIFICATION AND THEN YOU HAVE

02:26:35.453 --> 02:26:37.288
A PRESUMPTION THAT COULD

02:26:37.355 --> 02:26:39.524
PRESUMPTION CAN BE OVERCOME --

02:26:39.590 --> 02:26:40.358
THROUGH THE PROCEEDINGS BUT YOU

02:26:40.424 --> 02:26:42.226
HAVE A PRESUMPTION.

02:26:42.293 --> 02:26:44.262
SO IT IT CREATES AN INCENTIVE

02:26:44.328 --> 02:26:46.998
STRUCTURE IN A FUNDING MECHANISM

02:26:47.064 --> 02:26:48.232
TO MAKE SURE THE I USE ARE

02:26:48.299 --> 02:26:49.700
INVESTING IN SAFETY FIRST AND

02:26:49.767 --> 02:26:50.701
MAKE SURE THEY'RE CHANGING THEIR

02:26:50.768 --> 02:26:51.969
INTERNAL CULTURES.

02:26:52.036 --> 02:26:53.838
SO THAT THEY TAKE A SAFETY FIRST

02:26:53.905 --> 02:26:55.740
MENTALITY AND OUT HOW THEY

02:26:55.806 --> 02:26:57.708
ALLOCATE THE RESOURCES THAT'S MY

02:26:57.775 --> 02:26:58.910
UNDERSTANDING THE BILL.

02:26:58.976 --> 02:27:01.078
I WOULD WELCOME ANY OF THE

02:27:01.145 --> 02:27:02.580
AUTHORS OF LIKE TO EXPOUND UPON --

02:27:02.647 --> 02:27:04.549
I WOULD START WITH YES THOSE

02:27:04.615 --> 02:27:05.483
THOSE THINGS ARE IN PLACE AND

02:27:05.550 --> 02:27:06.717
THERE'S A CERTIFICATION IN PLACE

02:27:06.784 --> 02:27:08.386
BUT THERE IS ALSO BEFORE THAT

02:27:08.452 --> 02:27:09.020
FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN

02:27:09.086 --> 02:27:10.555
AGGREGATE THAT HAS TO GO TO

02:27:10.621 --> 02:27:12.123
INFRASTRUCTURE FIRE SAFETY

OR PROFIT FROM THAT INVESTMENT

02:27:30.908 --> 02:27:32.210
SO I MEAN THAT'S AN INITIAL

02:27:32.276 --> 02:27:33.945

02:34:17.681 --> 02:34:19.683
BOTH OF THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES THE

02:34:19.750 --> 02:34:20.484
ENTITY WOULD HAVE TO RE

02:34:20.551 --> 02:34:22.353
REIMBURSE THE FUN FOR A 100% OF

02:34:22.419 --> 02:34:22.987
THE COST.

02:34:23.053 --> 02:34:25.389
SO IF WE STEP BACK AND WE KIND

02:34:25.456 --> 02:34:25.889
OF LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT

02:34:25.956 --> 02:34:27.257
ELEMENTS THAT -- MISS BURKE

02:34:27.324 --> 02:34:29.827
SPOKE TO AND RELATIVE TO TO HOW

02:34:29.893 --> 02:34:30.761
THE THE BILL THE STRUCTURE.

02:34:30.828 --> 02:34:33.030
FRONT AND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS

02:34:33.097 --> 02:34:35.566
ANNUAL PLANS THOSE ANNUAL PLANTS

02:34:35.633 --> 02:34:36.900
REQUIRE PROGRESS REPORTS THOSE

02:34:36.967 --> 02:34:38.469
PROGRESS RICK BUT REPORTS ALSO

02:34:38.535 --> 02:34:41.438
ACCOMPANIED BY FIELD EVALUATIONS --

02:34:41.505 --> 02:34:42.840
SO ACTUAL BOOTS ON THE GROUND

02:34:42.906 --> 02:34:44.308
VERIFYING THE UTILITIES ARE

02:34:44.375 --> 02:34:45.275
DOING WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO

02:34:45.342 --> 02:34:46.944
DO FULL ENFORCEMENT ACTION

02:34:47.011 --> 02:34:48.812
INITIALLY WITHIN THE P. YOU SEE

02:34:48.879 --> 02:34:49.613
SUBSEQUENTLY WITHIN THE

STANDALONE DEPARTMENT THAT IS

02:34:51.181 --> 02:34:54.351
GOING TO BE SOLELY FOCUSED ON ON

02:34:54.418 --> 02:34:56.520
THE THE YOU KNOW THE SAFETY OF

02:34:56.587 --> 02:34:57.554
OUR ELECTRICITY.

02:34:57.621 --> 02:34:59.690
TRANSMISSION INFRASTRUCTURE --

02:34:59.757 --> 02:35:01.659
THOSE THAT DOES CERTIFICATION

02:35:01.725 --> 02:35:04.128
HAS TO BE IN PLACE IN ORDER FOR

A UTILITY TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE

02:35:06.096 --> 02:35:06.563
FUND.

02:35:06.630 --> 02:35:08.866
THE UTILITIES ALSO ARE GOING TO

02:35:08.932 --> 02:35:10.834
HAVE TO PRE FUND TEN AND A HALF

02:35:10.901 --> 02:35:14.238
BILLION DOLLARS OF OF OF FUNDING

02:35:14.304 --> 02:35:15.906
INTO THAT FUND TO MAKE IT

02:35:15.973 --> 02:35:16.507
AVAILABLE FOR CLAIMS PAYING

02:35:16.573 --> 02:35:18.509
RESOURCES IN THE CASE OF UTILITY

02:35:18.575 --> 02:35:21.478
COSTS WILDFIRES.

02:35:21.545 --> 02:35:22.680
THAT IF THAT FUND THAT TEN AND A

02:35:22.746 --> 02:35:26.750
HALF BILLION COMES WITH A

02:35:26.817 --> 02:35:27.651
DEDUCTIBLE.

02:35:27.718 --> 02:35:28.585
THAT DEDUCTIBLE THOUGH VERY

02:35:28.652 --> 02:35:30.254
SPACED ON REPAIR I'M SORRY ON

02:35:30.320 --> 02:35:31.155
UTILITY BEHAVIOR IF THE

02:35:31.221 --> 02:35:32.423
UTILITIES ACT PRUDENTLY THEN THE

02:35:32.489 --> 02:35:33.524
FUND WOULD PAY THE CLAIMS THE

02:35:33.590 --> 02:35:34.658
UTILITIES DON'T HAVE ADDITIONAL

02:35:34.725 --> 02:35:35.826
CONTRIBUTIONS.

02:35:35.893 --> 02:35:38.495
IF THE UTILITIES DON'T DO WHAT

02:35:38.562 --> 02:35:39.663
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO BUT ACT

02:35:39.730 --> 02:35:41.365
BUT BUT DO HAVE A VALID

CERTIFICATE ENACT WITHIN REASON.

02:35:43.100 --> 02:35:44.368
THEY WOULD HAVE.

02:35:44.435 --> 02:35:46.270
A DEDUCTIBLE THAT DEDUCTIBLE

02:35:46.336 --> 02:35:48.272
WOULD BURY THEIR TOTAL EXPOSURE

02:35:48.338 --> 02:35:50.407
ON THE THAT DEDUCTIBLE IS THIRTY

02:35:50.474 --> 02:35:51.308
THREE BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S

02:35:51.375 --> 02:35:52.309
ANOTHER THIRTY THREE BILLION

02:35:52.376 --> 02:35:54.111
DOLLARS OF THE UTILITIES WOULD

02:35:54.178 --> 02:35:55.646
HAVE TO FUND WITHOUT RECOVERY.

02:35:55.713 --> 02:35:56.947
WITHOUT ANY COST RECOVERY FOR

02:35:57.014 --> 02:35:58.382
RATEPAYERS THAT WOULD BE

02:35:58.449 --> 02:36:00.117
AVAILABLE FOR CLAIMS PAYING

02:36:00.184 --> 02:36:01.618
RESOURCES AS WELL IF THE

02:36:01.685 --> 02:36:03.187
UTILITIES HOWEVER DON'T HAVE A

WILLFULLY -- OR NEGLIGENT OR

02:36:07.725 --> 02:36:08.592
WILFUL IN THEIR IN THEIR

02:36:08.659 --> 02:36:09.860
NEGLIGENCE ACTION THEY WOULD

02:36:09.927 --> 02:36:11.762
HAVE TO REIMBURSE THE PHONE FOR

02:36:11.829 --> 02:36:13.197
A 100% OF THE COST SO I THINK.

02:36:13.263 --> 02:36:16.300
THAT THAT PIECE IS AN IS IS AN

02:36:16.366 --> 02:36:18.602
ELEMENT BUT IT'S THE THE THE

02:36:18.669 --> 02:36:20.237
EDITORIAL IS MISSING THE OTHER

02:36:20.304 --> 02:36:22.072
TWO COMPONENTS UNDER WHICH THAT

02:36:22.139 --> 02:36:23.841
CAP ACTUALLY GOES AWAY AND IS

02:36:23.907 --> 02:36:25.776
NOT AVAILABLE TO A UTILITY THAT

02:36:25.843 --> 02:36:26.910
IS NOT ACTING RESPONSIBLY ALL

02:36:26.977 --> 02:36:28.846
RIGHT AND AND AND SO -- I I

02:36:28.912 --> 02:36:30.914
BELIEVE THAT THAT WAS WHAT YOU

02:36:30.981 --> 02:36:33.484
INDICATED EXPLAIN NOW IT WAS MY

02:36:33.550 --> 02:36:35.619
UNDERSTANDING AND SO I IS IT

02:36:35.686 --> 02:36:37.321
DIDN'T THAT THAT SENSES

02:36:37.387 --> 02:36:38.255
CHRONICLE STATEMENT DIDN'T SOUND.

02:36:38.322 --> 02:36:40.090
ACCURATE AND I I JUST WANT TO

02:36:40.157 --> 02:36:41.825
CLARIFY THAT BUT YOU KNOW IN

02:36:41.892 --> 02:36:44.461
TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT THAT

02:36:44.528 --> 02:36:47.965
RATE PAYERS ARE PROTECTED --

02:36:48.031 --> 02:36:49.700
YEAH I I I EGGS MY MET WITH TURN

02:36:49.767 --> 02:36:51.702
YESTERDAY AND AND AND THEY TOLD

02:36:51.769 --> 02:36:52.770
ME THAT.

02:36:52.836 --> 02:36:54.304
THEY ARE SUPPORTING THIS BILL

02:36:54.371 --> 02:36:56.940
BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE THERE'S A

02:36:57.007 --> 02:36:59.710
CAP AND A CERTAINTY IN TERMS OF

02:36:59.777 --> 02:37:01.979
HOW MUCH RATE PAYERS.

02:37:02.045 --> 02:37:03.480
WOULD PAY ARE AND AND THAT WOULD%

02:37:03.547 --> 02:37:05.749
BE THE TEN POINT FIVE BILLION --

02:37:05.816 --> 02:37:07.484
THAT THAT THAT -- WE WOULD BE

02:37:07.551 --> 02:37:09.853
COMING FROM THE D. W. R. FEES

02:37:09.920 --> 02:37:12.456
YES FROM A FROM -- DRAPER

02:37:12.523 --> 02:37:13.991
PERSPECTIVE IN TERMS OF THE NEW

02:37:14.057 --> 02:37:15.225
REQUIREMENTS -- IN IN THE

02:37:15.292 --> 02:37:17.194
MEASURE SO THE MEASURE

02:37:17.261 --> 02:37:19.329
AUTHORIZES THE PEW SEEK TO ADOPT

02:37:19.396 --> 02:37:21.331
THE EXTENSION OF THE THE W.

02:37:21.398 --> 02:37:22.266
ALREADY TRUCK WHICH IS CHARGING

02:37:22.332 --> 02:37:28.906
FOLKS ARE PAYING TODAY.

02:37:28.972 --> 02:37:30.607
IT WOULD BE CAPS TO TEN AND A

02:37:30.674 --> 02:37:31.241
HALF BILLION DOLLARS THAT IS THE

02:37:31.308 --> 02:37:32.342
RATE PAYER EXPOSURE UNDER THE

02:37:32.409 --> 02:37:32.843
MEASURE.

02:37:32.910 --> 02:37:33.944
WHILE THE FUND IS IN EFFECT IN

02:37:34.011 --> 02:37:34.578
THERE ARE MECHANISMS IN PLACE

02:37:34.645 --> 02:37:35.379
WE'VE MODELED AND WE BELIEVE THE

02:37:35.445 --> 02:37:35.979
FUND WILL REMAIN IN PLACE FOR

02:37:36.046 --> 02:37:36.613
TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS AND THAT IS

02:37:36.680 --> 02:37:37.047
WITHOUT TAKING INTO

02:37:37.114 --> 02:37:37.414
CONSIDERATION.

02:37:37.481 --> 02:37:38.782
ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE

02:37:38.849 --> 02:37:40.317
UTILITIES MAY HAVE TO MAKE BASED

02:37:40.384 --> 02:37:42.653
ON THEIR BEHAVIOR -- SO THAT'S

02:37:42.719 --> 02:37:44.254
THE AND THE THE OTHER PIECES

02:37:44.321 --> 02:37:45.956
THERE'S A RATE PAYER US SAVING

02:37:46.023 --> 02:37:48.025
SO UNDER.

02:37:48.091 --> 02:37:49.359
UNDER CURRENT LAW THE REQUIRED

02:37:49.426 --> 02:37:50.828
INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE

02:37:50.894 --> 02:37:52.462
THAT MISS BURKE SPOKE TO

02:37:52.529 --> 02:37:54.932
RELATIVE TO THE FIVE BILLION

02:37:54.998 --> 02:37:55.199
DOLLARS.

02:37:55.265 --> 02:37:55.966
UTILITIES UNDER CURRENT LAW

02:37:56.033 --> 02:37:56.567
WOULD BE ABLE OR AT A RATE OF

02:37:56.633 --> 02:37:58.669
RETURN ON THAT SO THAT THAT CAN

02:37:58.735 --> 02:38:01.705
RANGE YOU KNOW BETWEEN YOU KNOW.

02:38:01.772 --> 02:38:04.174
101010% 12% OR SO THEY UTILITIES

02:38:04.241 --> 02:38:05.375
ARE SEEKING TO INCREASE THOSE

02:38:05.442 --> 02:38:07.544
LIMITS THIS WOULD TAKE THOSE

02:38:07.611 --> 02:38:08.378
DOLLARS TO ZERO THAT'S TWO AND A

02:38:08.445 --> 02:38:10.080
HALF BILLION DOLLARS OF REPAIR

02:38:10.147 --> 02:38:11.782
SAVINGS UNDER THIS MEASURE

02:38:11.849 --> 02:38:12.416
COMPARED TO CURRENT LAW OKAY.

02:38:12.482 --> 02:38:14.418
BUT BUT I WANT TO FOCUS ON THE

02:38:14.484 --> 02:38:16.787
QUALIFIER THAT YOU PUT INTO --

02:38:16.854 --> 02:38:17.788
AND IN IN YOUR SEAT YEAH I WANT

02:38:17.855 --> 02:38:19.256
TO RESPECT ALL OF THE MEMBERS

02:38:19.323 --> 02:38:20.958
AND THEIR TIME FOR QUESTIONING

02:38:21.024 --> 02:38:21.758
BUT I HAVE THREE OTHER MEMBERS

02:38:21.825 --> 02:38:23.026
THAT ARE WAITING TO YES THANK

02:38:23.093 --> 02:38:24.328
YOU VERY MUCH MISS CHAMP.

02:38:24.394 --> 02:38:26.530
SO -- YOU YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE

02:38:26.597 --> 02:38:28.332
QUALIFIER THAT YOU YOU INDICATED

02:38:28.398 --> 02:38:31.034
IS THAT THE IS THAT THE CAP IN

02:38:31.101 --> 02:38:32.469
THE CERTAINTY WOULD BE APPLY

02:38:32.536 --> 02:38:36.573
WHILE THE FUND IS IN EFFECT IS

02:38:36.640 --> 02:38:38.041
THAT CORRECT.

02:38:38.108 --> 02:38:38.842
WHILE WHILE THE FUND HAS CLAIMS

02:38:38.909 --> 02:38:39.643
BEING RESOURCES THE TEN AND A

02:38:39.710 --> 02:38:40.777
HALF BILLION DOLLARS IS THE IS

02:38:40.844 --> 02:38:42.446
THE AMOUNT AND WE BELIEVE THE

02:38:42.512 --> 02:38:43.413
FUNDS WILL BE.

02:38:43.480 --> 02:38:46.149
IN EFFECT FOR AT LEAST TEN TO

02:38:46.216 --> 02:38:48.018
FIFTEEN YEARS COULD BE LONGER

02:38:48.085 --> 02:38:49.586
ALL RIGHT BUT THE AT THE YOUR

02:38:49.653 --> 02:38:51.722
YOUR PROJECTION IS IS THAT THIS

02:38:51.788 --> 02:38:52.890
FUND WOULD BE.

02:38:52.956 --> 02:38:55.058
A FORTY BILLION DOLLAR FUND --

02:38:55.125 --> 02:38:58.328
THAT THAT -- IS PROJECTED TO BE

02:38:58.395 --> 02:39:00.197
EFFECTIVE FOR TEN DO UP TO

02:39:00.264 --> 02:39:01.565
FIFTEEN YEARS TO FORTY BILLION

02:39:01.632 --> 02:39:02.499
DOLLARS IN CLAIMS PAYING

02:39:02.566 --> 02:39:05.302
RESOURCES THAT WOULD PROVIDE --

02:39:05.369 --> 02:39:07.137
THE PROVIDE -- COUPLE COVERED

02:39:07.204 --> 02:39:09.306
BETWEEN AT LEAST TEN TO FIFTEEN

02:39:09.373 --> 02:39:09.706
YEARS.

02:39:09.773 --> 02:39:12.242
IT COULD BE LARGER SO FOR

02:39:12.309 --> 02:39:13.710
EXAMPLE IF YOU TELL THESE ARE

02:39:13.777 --> 02:39:15.112
BAR HAVING TO PAY ADDITIONAL

02:39:15.178 --> 02:39:16.213
DEDUCTIBLES.

02:39:16.280 --> 02:39:18.181
THAT WOULD BE MORE MONEY INTO

02:39:18.248 --> 02:39:20.884
THE FUND LONGER TIME PERIOD FOR

02:39:20.951 --> 02:39:22.920
CLAIMS FAMILIES ALL RIGHT BUT WE

02:39:22.986 --> 02:39:24.254
WE WE JUST HEARD.

02:39:24.321 --> 02:39:26.023
TO THE MATH THE CHAIRMAN OF THE

02:39:26.089 --> 02:39:26.757
COMMITTEE.

02:39:26.823 --> 02:39:29.893
A TESTIFIED THAT TEN OF THE LAST.

02:39:29.960 --> 02:39:31.361
NO THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE A WILD

02:39:31.428 --> 02:39:35.766
FIRES IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY HAVE

02:39:35.832 --> 02:39:37.801
BEEN IN THE LAST. FOR YEARS HAVE

02:39:37.868 --> 02:39:39.069
LIFE SINCE.

02:39:39.136 --> 02:39:40.270
TWENTY FIFTEEN AND AND IN THE

02:39:40.337 --> 02:39:41.371
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THERE IS THE

02:39:41.438 --> 02:39:43.640
FIGURE THAT THE DAMAGES JUST

02:39:43.707 --> 02:39:46.243
FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN TWENTY

02:39:46.310 --> 02:39:47.110
EIGHTEEN IS ESTIMATED TO BE

02:39:47.177 --> 02:39:49.079
TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS.

02:39:49.146 --> 02:39:50.747
AND IT'S SO SO IT IT IT IT SEEMS

02:39:50.814 --> 02:39:52.683
CLEAR -- JUST FROM THE HISTORY

02:39:52.749 --> 02:39:54.318
THAT.

02:39:54.384 --> 02:39:56.153
CLIMATE CHANGE IS HERE AND NOW

02:39:56.219 --> 02:39:57.788
IT'S ONLY GONNA GET WORSE WE

02:39:57.854 --> 02:39:59.656
ALREADY SUFFERED TWENTY BILLION

02:39:59.723 --> 02:40:01.758
DOLLARS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS.

02:40:01.825 --> 02:40:04.194
I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE.

02:40:04.261 --> 02:40:06.163
I DON'T FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THIS

02:40:06.229 --> 02:40:07.931
FORTY BILLION DOLLARS IS GOING

02:40:07.998 --> 02:40:09.733
TO LAST AS LONG AS YOU'RE YOU'RE

02:40:09.800 --> 02:40:11.001
REPRESENTING.

02:40:11.068 --> 02:40:13.870
IN THE MEANTIME WE ARE WEAKENING

02:40:13.937 --> 02:40:15.906
THE PRUDENT MANAGEMENT STANDARD

02:40:15.973 --> 02:40:17.574
THAT WILL ALLOW.

02:40:17.641 --> 02:40:19.876
YOU KNOW THE COST TO BE PASSED

02:40:19.943 --> 02:40:22.346
ON TO RATE PAYERS AT AT AT A

02:40:22.412 --> 02:40:24.114
LOWER STANDARD [inaudible]

02:40:24.181 --> 02:40:26.883
MY CONCERN.

02:40:26.950 --> 02:40:28.352
IS THAT THIS IS.

02:40:28.418 --> 02:40:31.555
READING IT'S OPENING THE WINDOW

02:40:31.621 --> 02:40:33.223
FOR RATE PAYERS DIFFERENT

02:40:33.290 --> 02:40:36.860
FURTHER BE SETTLED BY -- THE

02:40:36.927 --> 02:40:38.628

02:40:51.541 --> 02:40:52.743
WAY WE'VE DONE THEM FOR THE LAST

02:40:52.809 --> 02:40:54.478
HUNDRED YEARS THAT FUND WOULD

02:40:54.544 --> 02:40:56.013

02:40:56.079 --> 02:40:57.214
ONE BILLION.

02:40:57.280 --> 02:40:58.648
WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IS

02:40:58.715 --> 02:41:00.684
SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT WE ARE

02:41:00.751 --> 02:41:03.220
TURNING OFF THE POWER TO THE

02:41:03.286 --> 02:41:05.655
LINES ON A REGULAR BASIS.

02:41:05.722 --> 02:41:07.224
ANY TIME THERE CONDITIONS THAT

02:41:07.290 --> 02:41:10.260
WE KNOW WILL CAUSE A WILDFIRE.

02:41:10.327 --> 02:41:13.130
OF THE TYPE THAT TO CURD -- THE

02:41:13.196 --> 02:41:15.332
CAMPFIRE IT CETERA WE OF HIGH

02:41:17.367 --> 02:41:19.169
TEMPERATURES THE LINES ARE JUST

02:41:19.236 --> 02:41:20.337
GETTING TURNED OFF.

02:41:20.404 --> 02:41:22.639
MISTER GALLAGHER WHO HAS SEEN

02:41:22.706 --> 02:41:24.274
MOST OF THESE CAN TELL YOU HOW

02:41:24.341 --> 02:41:25.809
DISRUPTIVE THAT IS.

02:41:25.876 --> 02:41:27.010
THE OTHER THING IS THEY'RE

02:41:27.077 --> 02:41:29.146
ASKING FOR FIVE BILLION DOLLARS

02:41:29.212 --> 02:41:30.647
TO UPGRADE THE SYSTEM.

02:41:30.714 --> 02:41:34.351
AND THAT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS --

02:41:34.418 --> 02:41:35.986
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE BEST WAY

02:41:36.053 --> 02:41:39.289
TO SPEND IT IS BUT FOR EXAMPLE --

02:41:39.356 --> 02:41:42.192
THEY'RE LOOKING AT IF A WIRE

02:41:42.259 --> 02:41:45.362
BREAKS THAT THEY THEN.

02:41:45.429 --> 02:41:48.932
TURN OFF THE THE POWER TO THAT

02:41:48.999 --> 02:41:50.901
WIRE INTERMITTENT THERE.

02:41:50.967 --> 02:41:51.802
THERE ARE DOZENS OF DIFFERENT

02:41:51.868 --> 02:41:53.437
THINGS THAT COULD BE DONE I

02:41:53.503 --> 02:41:55.005
CAN'T TELL YOU WHICH ONES.

02:41:55.072 --> 02:41:57.274
BUT THIS YOU'RE RIGHT IF WE DID

02:41:57.340 --> 02:41:58.575
THINGS THE WAY WE'VE DONE THEM

02:41:58.642 --> 02:42:00.210
FOR THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS THIS

02:42:00.277 --> 02:42:01.478
FUND WOULD NOT LAST.

02:42:01.545 --> 02:42:03.413
THE PEOPLE WHO LOOKED AT THIS

02:42:03.480 --> 02:42:05.816
LOOKED AT IT TO DETERMINE WHAT

02:42:05.882 --> 02:42:09.886
WAS NEEDED IF WE WENT WITH THE

02:42:09.953 --> 02:42:10.554
NEW PROCEDURES.

02:42:10.620 --> 02:42:12.289
I WILL SAY THAT.

02:42:12.355 --> 02:42:13.557
THE OTHER THING THEY'VE DONE IS

02:42:13.623 --> 02:42:15.859
WE'RE TRYING TO PREVENT ADDISON

02:42:15.926 --> 02:42:18.361
IN PARTICULAR -- BUT TO SOME

02:42:18.428 --> 02:42:19.529
EXTENT SEMPRA.

02:42:19.596 --> 02:42:22.365
FROM GOING INTO JUNK BOND STATUS

02:42:22.432 --> 02:42:24.401
ARE ONCE THAT HAPPENS THERE'S A

02:42:24.468 --> 02:42:26.937
SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF THEM GOING

02:42:27.003 --> 02:42:29.272
INTO THE SAME BANKRUPTCY AT

02:42:29.339 --> 02:42:30.273
WHICH POINT.

02:42:30.340 --> 02:42:32.609
THE FED COURT TAKES OVER AND WE

02:42:32.676 --> 02:42:36.513
HAVE VERY LITTLE -- LEVERAGE ONE

02:42:36.580 --> 02:42:38.381
OF THE POINTS OF THIS BILL IS TO

02:42:38.448 --> 02:42:40.784
GET P. GENIE OUT OF BANKRUPTCY

02:42:40.851 --> 02:42:42.152
QUICKLY THEY CAN ONLY AVAIL

02:42:42.219 --> 02:42:43.720
THEMSELVES OF THIS FUND.

02:42:43.787 --> 02:42:45.122
IF THEY CAN GET OUT QUICKLY AND

02:42:45.188 --> 02:42:46.957
PART OF THAT IS SETTLING THEIR

02:42:47.023 --> 02:42:51.628
CURRENT -- CLAIMS -- THE OTHER

02:42:51.695 --> 02:42:53.463
THING SO THAT I THINK IS ONE OF

02:42:53.530 --> 02:42:54.965
THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS I'LL

02:42:55.031 --> 02:42:57.300
ALSO SAY THAT I DOUBT THAT

02:42:57.367 --> 02:42:59.269
ANYONE AT THE CHRONICLE A REALLY

02:42:59.336 --> 02:43:02.005
READ THE HUNDRED PAGES AND I'LL

02:43:02.072 --> 02:43:04.908
GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE -- LAST YEAR

02:43:04.975 --> 02:43:06.843
I PUT OUT A BILL PRIOR TO NINE

02:43:06.910 --> 02:43:08.612
NO.

02:43:08.678 --> 02:43:10.514

02:43:15.752 --> 02:43:17.254
PAY OFF.

02:43:17.320 --> 02:43:20.390
OF THE THE CLAIMANTS BUT ALL OF

02:43:20.457 --> 02:43:21.691
THAT MONEY WOULD THEN BE

02:43:21.758 --> 02:43:23.126
REIMBURSED BY THE UNDERSTOOD

02:43:23.193 --> 02:43:24.427
UTILITY.

02:43:24.494 --> 02:43:25.829
NONE THE LESS EVEN THOUGH THAT

02:43:25.896 --> 02:43:28.298
WAS A 100% REIMBURSEMENT TO THE

02:43:28.365 --> 02:43:30.233
CUSTOMERS WHO WAS CALLED TO BAIL

02:43:30.300 --> 02:43:32.435
OUT -- I JUST SHRUGGED IT OFF

02:43:32.502 --> 02:43:33.803
BECAUSE PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT

02:43:33.870 --> 02:43:36.473

THE FINAL I'D LIKE TO BRING UP

02:45:19.142 --> 02:45:20.310
ONE SEPARATE ISSUE.

02:45:20.377 --> 02:45:24.080
SO THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO AND

02:45:24.147 --> 02:45:26.182

02:45:26.249 --> 02:45:28.652
COUPLE OF MY CONSTITUENTS HAVE

02:45:28.718 --> 02:45:30.186
SAID THAT.

02:45:30.253 --> 02:45:31.288
THIS BILL WILL MAKE IT

02:45:31.354 --> 02:45:34.057
IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO TAKE OVER

02:45:34.124 --> 02:45:35.925

02:45:37.794 --> 02:45:39.896
LABOR PROTECTION ITEM.

02:45:39.963 --> 02:45:44.868

02:45:56.913 --> 02:45:58.848
THAT IS A WAY OF PROTECTING RATE

02:45:58.915 --> 02:46:01.451
PAYERS AND A WAY OF PROTECTING

02:46:01.518 --> 02:46:03.920

THEIR PAY REDUCED IT CETERA

02:46:14.331 --> 02:46:16.366
THOSE ARE LABOR NOW THAT DOES

02:46:16.433 --> 02:46:17.801
TAKE LONGER.

02:46:17.867 --> 02:46:19.636

NEED TO STABILIZE EVERYTHING --

02:48:38.641 --> 02:48:40.276
BUT THEY'RE ALL I MEAN I THINK

02:48:40.343 --> 02:48:41.311
WE ALSO NEED.

02:48:41.377 --> 02:48:44.747
TO PROVIDE SPACE IF THERE ARE.

02:48:44.814 --> 02:48:46.349
VIABLE OTHER PROJECTS OUT THERE

02:48:46.416 --> 02:48:47.884
IN MY DISTRICT SINCE IT FOR

02:48:47.951 --> 02:48:49.352
CLOSE TO MY DISTRICT SINCE.

02:48:49.419 --> 02:48:50.820
THE BEGINNING OF THE OF TWO

02:48:50.887 --> 02:48:52.388
THOUSANDS SOUTH

02:48:52.455 --> 02:48:53.756
TELECOMMUNICATION DISTRICT HAS

02:48:53.823 --> 02:48:55.225
BEEN TRYING TO TAKE OVER PART OF

02:48:55.291 --> 02:48:56.926
THE P. JEAN AREA AND HAS BEEN A

02:48:56.993 --> 02:48:58.695

THEY ARE AND I B. W. SHOT.

02:49:01.898 --> 02:49:02.999
AND SO THEIR ISSUES ARE ARE NOT

02:49:03.066 --> 02:49:04.334
AROUND THE EMPLOYEES BUT ITS

02:49:04.400 --> 02:49:06.936
AROUND THE EXTRA WHO THEN THAT

02:49:07.003 --> 02:49:08.037

TO THE PC.

02:49:10.740 --> 02:49:12.041
SO I THINK THOSE ARE THE REAL

02:49:12.108 --> 02:49:15.044
ISSUES.

02:49:15.111 --> 02:49:16.846

WE DON'T HAVE THE INTERRUPTIONS

02:54:14.410 --> 02:54:16.078
THAT ARE THAT ARE CURRENTLY --

02:54:16.145 --> 02:54:16.579
THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING

02:54:16.646 --> 02:54:18.447
CONSIDERED SO YOU KNOW THE PART

02:54:18.514 --> 02:54:19.882

INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:54:22.552 --> 02:54:23.753
GETTING THE GREAT HARDENING

02:54:23.820 --> 02:54:25.121
GETTING THE OTHER ELEMENTS IN

02:54:25.188 --> 02:54:28.291
PLACE THAT MAKES IT POSSIBLE --

02:54:28.357 --> 02:54:30.026
FOR GETS PGA ANY CLOSER TO WORST

02:54:30.092 --> 02:54:31.460
INDIO GAS AND ELECTRIC IS WHERE

WHEN THEY LOOK AT CONDITIONS ANY

02:54:33.729 --> 02:54:35.131
ANY SHOW ANY INTERRUPTIONS ARE

02:54:35.198 --> 02:54:36.065
SHORTER.

02:54:36.132 --> 02:54:38.601
MORE LOCALIZED THE POWER --

02:54:38.668 --> 02:54:45.408
RESTORATION HAPPENS FASTER --

02:54:45.474 --> 02:54:46.008
THE SAFETY INVESTMENTS THE NEW

ACCOUNTABILITY PROVISIONS ARE

02:54:46.676 --> 02:54:47.176
IMPORTANT TO GET TO A PLACE

02:54:47.243 --> 02:54:47.410
WHERE.

02:54:47.476 --> 02:54:48.077
THAT IS HAPPENING YOU KNOW WHERE

02:54:48.144 --> 02:54:49.612
WHERE THE SERVICE INTERRUPTION

02:54:49.679 --> 02:54:51.080
THAT FOLKS ARE ARE CURRENTLY

02:54:51.147 --> 02:54:52.715
EXPERIENCING IN P. JEANNIE

02:54:52.782 --> 02:54:54.050
SERVICE TERRITORY IN EDISON

02:54:54.116 --> 02:54:55.284
TERRITORY HAPPENS IS A CELL THE

02:54:55.351 --> 02:54:56.319
MOST POSSIBLE SO.

02:54:56.385 --> 02:54:58.788
IN TERMS OF THE OVERALL -- YOU

02:54:58.855 --> 02:55:00.256
KNOW AND THE OVERALL WORKER

02:55:00.323 --> 02:55:01.924
PROTECTIONS WE WE THINK THEY'RE

02:55:01.991 --> 02:55:03.759
VERY CRITICAL THE CHANGES ARE

02:55:03.826 --> 02:55:05.294
INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT.

02:55:05.361 --> 02:55:08.097
THE PC HAS OVERSIGHT WHEN THERE

02:55:08.164 --> 02:55:09.665
ARE NOT AGREEMENTS REACHED OR

02:55:09.732 --> 02:55:11.434
WHEN THERE IS NOT OR WHEN THE

02:55:11.500 --> 02:55:12.602
BENEFITS THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED

02:55:12.668 --> 02:55:14.303
UNDER A SUCCESSOR TO PGA ANY.

02:55:14.370 --> 02:55:15.471
IN A SERVICE TERRITORY WOULD

02:55:15.538 --> 02:55:16.973
HAVE BENEFITS THAT ARE INFERIOR

02:55:17.039 --> 02:55:17.807
TO THOSE THAT ARE CURRENTLY

02:55:17.874 --> 02:55:19.342
PROVIDED SO IF THERE'S AN

02:55:19.408 --> 02:55:21.978
AGREEMENT OR IF THERE ARE -- IF

02:55:22.044 --> 02:55:23.045
THERE ARE BENEFITS THAT ARE AT

02:55:23.112 --> 02:55:24.680
THE SAME LEVEL OR HIGHER THAN

02:55:24.747 --> 02:55:27.884
THESE PROVISIONS -- DON'T DON'T --

02:55:27.950 --> 02:55:28.818
YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE NOT

02:55:28.885 --> 02:55:30.119
BASICALLY THERE IS A BUILT IN

02:55:30.186 --> 02:55:32.455
MECHANISM FOR FOLKS TO NOT HAVE

02:55:32.521 --> 02:55:33.022
TO GO THROUGH THE OVERSIGHT

02:55:33.089 --> 02:55:35.224
PROCESS IT IT'S PROVIDING THE

02:55:35.291 --> 02:55:36.726
WORKER PROTECTIONS THAT ARE

02:55:36.792 --> 02:55:37.026
NECESSARY.

02:55:37.093 --> 02:55:37.526
TO DO THAT WE ARE IN

02:55:37.593 --> 02:55:39.528
CONVERSATIONS WITH -- WITH THE

02:55:39.595 --> 02:55:40.997
VARIOUS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT

02:55:41.063 --> 02:55:42.465
HAVE RAISED ISSUES AND IF THERE

02:55:42.531 --> 02:55:44.233
OFFER SEEN CIRCUMSTANCE IF

02:55:44.300 --> 02:55:45.801
THEY'RE UNFORESEEN CHALLENGES.

02:55:45.868 --> 02:55:47.503
WE YOU KNOW WE WILL -- WE WILL

02:55:47.570 --> 02:55:48.704
BRING THIS TO THE ATTENTION BUT

02:55:48.771 --> 02:55:50.706
OUR SENSES IT'S REALLY CRITICAL

02:55:50.773 --> 02:55:52.108
TO HAVE THESE WORKER PROTECTIONS

02:55:52.174 --> 02:55:53.776
AND WE THINK THESE CHANGES ARE

02:55:53.843 --> 02:55:54.277
JUSTIFIED IN APPROACH.

02:55:54.343 --> 02:55:55.278
YEAH WHAT.

02:55:55.344 --> 02:55:56.145
EVERYBODY AGREES THAT THE

02:55:56.212 --> 02:55:57.680
WORKERS SHOULD BE PROTECTED AND

02:55:57.747 --> 02:55:58.948
I THINK IT'S ABOUT BOB WELL

02:55:59.015 --> 02:56:00.082
KNOWN ISSUE THAT THERE ARE NOT

02:56:00.149 --> 02:56:01.017
ENOUGH WORKERS TO GO AROUND

02:56:01.083 --> 02:56:02.318
RIGHT NOW SO WE NEED TO PROTECT

02:56:02.385 --> 02:56:03.786
THE ONES WE HAVE.

02:56:03.853 --> 02:56:04.453
THE WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE IT'S

02:56:04.520 --> 02:56:08.791
NOT.

02:56:08.858 --> 02:56:11.193
NOT JUST MAKING SURE.

02:56:11.260 --> 02:56:12.228
P. JEANNIE GETS A CONTINUE

02:56:12.295 --> 02:56:13.329
PRACTICING BAD BEHAVIOR AND THAT

02:56:13.396 --> 02:56:14.563
WE MAKE THINGS EASIER FOR THEM

02:56:14.630 --> 02:56:15.097
RATHER THAN HOLDING THEM

02:56:15.164 --> 02:56:15.431
ACCOUNTABLE.

02:56:15.498 --> 02:56:16.032
IF I MAY ON THE QUESTION OF

02:56:16.098 --> 02:56:17.433
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION THIS IS

02:56:17.500 --> 02:56:18.901
ONE OF THE THIS IS ONE OF THE

02:56:18.968 --> 02:56:21.037
AREAS WHERE THE AMENDMENTS --

02:56:21.103 --> 02:56:22.772
HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY STRENGTHENED

02:56:22.838 --> 02:56:24.607
THE BILL INCLUDED MUCH MORE

02:56:24.674 --> 02:56:26.108
ACCOUNTABILITY.

02:56:26.175 --> 02:56:28.477
AND AND AND SKIN IN THE GAME NOT

02:56:28.544 --> 02:56:29.645
ONLY FOR THE CORPORATIONS WOULD

02:56:29.712 --> 02:56:31.180
FOR EXECUTIVE SO THERE ARE

02:56:31.247 --> 02:56:32.748
STRONG PROVISIONS IN THE MEASURE

02:56:32.815 --> 02:56:34.951
WHERE THE PC WILL HAVE TO REVIEW

02:56:35.017 --> 02:56:36.886
THE PLANS FOR INCENTIVES THAT

02:56:36.953 --> 02:56:37.887
ARE.

02:56:37.954 --> 02:56:39.288
THAT THE THE INVESTOR OWNED

02:56:39.355 --> 02:56:40.556
UTILITIES HAVE AND THERE'S

02:56:40.623 --> 02:56:42.591
LANGUAGE AROUND YOU KNOW LOOKING

02:56:42.658 --> 02:56:45.194
AT NO -- NO INCENTIVES BEING.

02:56:45.261 --> 02:56:46.862
FOLKS NOT BEING ELIGIBLE FOR

02:56:46.929 --> 02:56:49.031
INCENTIVES OR BONUSES WHEN THE

02:56:49.098 --> 02:56:50.499
UTILITY BECAUSE THE WALL FAR THE

02:56:50.566 --> 02:56:51.701
LEADS IN LATIN TO THE DEATH

02:56:51.767 --> 02:56:53.102
THEY'RE BROUGHT IT BROADER

02:56:53.169 --> 02:56:55.237
STANDARDS THAT.

02:56:55.304 --> 02:56:59.075
THAT TIED TO JUST BROADLY

02:56:59.141 --> 02:56:59.909
LINKING.

02:56:59.976 --> 02:57:01.110
COMPENSATION INCENTIVE BONUSES

02:57:01.177 --> 02:57:01.677
TO SAFETY.

02:57:01.744 --> 02:57:02.812
ANY CRITERIA THAT WOULD BE

02:57:02.878 --> 02:57:04.513
CONSIDERED BUT KEY ONES WOULD BE

02:57:04.580 --> 02:57:05.948
DETAILED WITH THE POSSIBILITY

02:57:06.015 --> 02:57:08.784
BUT NO 1100% INCENTIVE NOT BEING

02:57:08.851 --> 02:57:11.387
PROVIDED WHEN.

ITS SAFETY OBLIGATIONS AND OR

02:57:13.422 --> 02:57:14.824
WHEN IT CAUSES A WILDFIRE THAT

02:57:14.890 --> 02:57:17.426
RESULTS AND -- AND IN ONE OR

02:57:17.493 --> 02:57:18.928
MORE FATALITIES AND I THINK I

02:57:18.995 --> 02:57:19.895
DID SIGNAL WHICH MEANT WHEN I

02:57:19.962 --> 02:57:20.930
SAID THAT PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN

02:57:20.997 --> 02:57:22.732
AGRICULTURAL AREAS ARE PAYING

02:57:22.798 --> 02:57:24.600
HIGHER RATES AND I I THINK I SAW

02:57:24.667 --> 02:57:26.435
THAT KNOWLEDGE MAN ON THAT AND

02:57:26.502 --> 02:57:28.671

OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE.

02:58:23.125 --> 02:58:24.226
WE'RE TRYING TO STABILIZE

02:58:24.293 --> 02:58:26.328
CALIFORNIA. FOR THE BENEFIT OF

02:58:26.395 --> 02:58:28.898
CALIFORNIA NOT FOR THE BENEFIT

02:58:28.964 --> 02:58:30.733
OF CORPORATIONS ARE INVESTORS

02:58:30.800 --> 02:58:32.101
BUT FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE

02:58:32.168 --> 02:58:34.170
VICTIMS IN THE RATE PAYERS AND

02:58:34.236 --> 02:58:35.204
THE WORKERS.

02:58:35.271 --> 02:58:39.108

APPRECIATE THE TIME THAT YOU

02:58:43.779 --> 02:58:45.081
HAVE.

02:58:45.147 --> 02:58:47.483
GIVEN TO TO TO US AS MEMBERS OF

02:58:47.550 --> 02:58:48.617
THIS COMMITTEE AND TWO OTHER

02:58:48.684 --> 02:58:51.420
COLLEAGUES. TO TO TAKE TIME TO

02:58:51.487 --> 02:58:53.589
ANSWER QUESTIONS OF THE

02:58:53.656 --> 02:58:55.391
SPEAKER'S OFFICE EACH OF YOU

02:58:55.458 --> 02:58:57.226
INDIVIDUALLY THE THE GOVERNOR'S

02:58:57.293 --> 02:58:58.260
OFFICE.

02:58:58.327 --> 02:59:00.696
BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD LOTS OF

02:59:00.763 --> 02:59:02.364
QUESTIONS.

02:59:02.431 --> 02:59:03.132
THAT'S WHY.

02:59:03.199 --> 02:59:05.134
EVEN TO NOW I STILL STRUGGLE

02:59:05.201 --> 02:59:06.569
WITH.

02:59:06.635 --> 02:59:10.272
AB TEN FIFTY FOUR AS I READ IT.

02:59:10.339 --> 02:59:11.674
AND I HAVE READ IT.

02:59:11.740 --> 02:59:13.809
AND I SIT WITH MEMBERS WHO HAVE

02:59:13.876 --> 02:59:15.878
READ IT NOT ONLY WHEN IT WAS

02:59:15.945 --> 02:59:17.680
FIRST PRESENTED TO US BUT EVEN

02:59:17.746 --> 02:59:19.448
AFTER THE AMENDMENTS.

02:59:19.515 --> 02:59:20.950
IT TAKES TIME TO READ THROUGH IT

02:59:21.016 --> 02:59:23.586
BUT WE HAVE READ IT BECAUSE THIS

02:59:23.652 --> 02:59:26.388
IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO US.

02:59:26.455 --> 02:59:29.024
MANY HAVE SAID AND I AGREE THE

02:59:29.091 --> 02:59:31.060
BILL IS FAR FROM PERFECT.

02:59:31.127 --> 02:59:33.629
IN THE PROCESS THAT WAS TAKEN TO

02:59:33.696 --> 02:59:35.231
BRING IT BEFORE US HAS ALSO BEEN

02:59:35.297 --> 02:59:37.867
LESS THAN PERFECT.

02:59:37.933 --> 02:59:40.436
I'M CONCERNED THAT THE BILL.

02:59:40.503 --> 02:59:43.572
PROPOSES A SHIFTING OF THE

02:59:43.639 --> 02:59:47.276
BURDEN. FOR TALKING ABOUT THE

02:59:47.343 --> 02:59:49.945
CONDUCT OF THE UTILITIES.

02:59:50.012 --> 02:59:50.980
CHANGING IT FROM THE

02:59:51.046 --> 02:59:53.916
RESPONSIBILITY OF OUR ELECTRICAL

02:59:53.983 --> 02:59:54.216
[inaudible]

02:59:54.283 --> 02:59:56.352
OPERATIONS.

02:59:56.418 --> 02:59:59.688
WHEN THEY HAVE THEIR CERTIFICATE?

02:59:59.755 --> 03:00:01.624
I KNOW THAT THAT I SPEAK FOR SO

03:00:01.690 --> 03:00:03.826
MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES.

03:00:03.893 --> 03:00:05.461
THERE WERE HOPEFUL THAT THE

03:00:05.528 --> 03:00:06.395
CERTIFICATION WILL MAKE A

03:00:06.462 --> 03:00:08.097
DIFFERENCE THAT THAT

03:00:08.164 --> 03:00:09.999
CERTIFICATION WILL REALLY

03:00:10.065 --> 03:00:12.201
SIGNIFIED THAT THESE ARE GOOD

03:00:12.268 --> 03:00:14.837
PLAYERS.

03:00:14.904 --> 03:00:17.006
BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE IS

03:00:17.072 --> 03:00:19.008
NO GUARANTEE.

03:00:19.074 --> 03:00:21.143
AND MY GREATEST CONCERN.

03:00:21.210 --> 03:00:23.412
IS HOLDING THE TELE TO USE

03:00:23.479 --> 03:00:27.149
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR BEHAVIOR.

03:00:27.216 --> 03:00:28.784
I I'M REALLY CONCERNED THAT

03:00:28.851 --> 03:00:31.020
WE'RE BEING ASKED TO ASSESS THE

03:00:31.086 --> 03:00:33.355
BEST COURSE OF ACTION TO ADDRESS

03:00:33.422 --> 03:00:36.358
THIS NEW REALITY OF CATASTROPHIC

03:00:36.425 --> 03:00:37.226
WILDFIRES [inaudible]

03:00:37.293 --> 03:00:39.828
GET IT. FOR IT BEING ASKED TO

03:00:39.895 --> 03:00:42.097
TAKE A LEAP OF FAITH.

03:00:42.164 --> 03:00:43.732
ON A BILL.

03:00:57.346 --> 03:00:59.381
I THINK THAT AS A LEGISLATURE WE

03:00:59.448 --> 03:01:01.016
NEED TO ASK OURSELVES.

03:01:01.083 --> 03:01:04.286
ARE WE CREATING A MORAL HAZARD.

03:01:04.353 --> 03:01:05.821
HOW WE CREATED A SITUATION WE

03:01:05.888 --> 03:01:08.057
DEPEND SO MUCH ON A CORPORATION?

03:01:08.123 --> 03:01:10.359
THAT WE FEEL WE MUST REGARDLESS

03:01:10.426 --> 03:01:11.827

AND THE RICH IN THE END THE

03:01:32.548 --> 03:01:36.185

FOR MOST OF MY TIME MY PIERCING

03:03:26.028 --> 03:03:27.262
WHEN YOU SEE.

03:03:27.329 --> 03:03:29.932
ON THE ELECTRICAL WORKERS WITH

03:03:29.998 --> 03:03:32.968
IOUS WITH THE PUBLIC UTILITIES.

03:03:33.035 --> 03:03:34.803
WITH TURNED WITH.

03:03:34.870 --> 03:03:35.504

IT'S VERY RARE. TO SEE THAT.

03:03:42.878 --> 03:03:44.780
UNFORTUNATELY MY PROBLEM IS THE

03:03:44.847 --> 03:03:46.081
PROBLEM THAT -- MY COLLEAGUE

FROM HE WOULD ARTICULATED

03:03:47.616 --> 03:03:50.052
REGARDING THE INVOLUNTARY

03:03:50.119 --> 03:03:52.287
INVOLUNTARY CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP

03:03:52.354 --> 03:03:54.423
OF ASSETS FROM COULD ELECTRICAL

03:03:54.490 --> 03:03:57.526
COMPANY TO OUR PUBLIC ENTITY AND

03:03:57.593 --> 03:03:58.160
SO I THINK.

03:03:58.227 --> 03:03:59.228
THAT THAT'S CREATED A

03:03:59.294 --> 03:04:00.629
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

03:04:00.696 --> 03:04:03.165
CONSTERNATION IN OPPOSITION IN

03:04:03.232 --> 03:04:05.467
MY OWN CITY -- THAT'S MATED --

03:04:05.534 --> 03:04:07.903
CHALLENGING FOR FOR ME TO

03:04:07.970 --> 03:04:09.772
SUPPORT IT I KNOW OUR SENATOR --

03:04:09.838 --> 03:04:11.039
WAS NOT ABLE TO SAY.

03:04:11.106 --> 03:04:13.675
WE WE HOPE THAT IN THE FUTURE

03:04:13.742 --> 03:04:15.744
THAT THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE CAN

03:04:15.811 --> 03:04:17.112
BE ADDRESSED.

03:04:17.179 --> 03:04:18.480
BUT AT THIS POINT I CAN'T

03:04:18.547 --> 03:04:24.686
SUPPORT THE LEGISLATION AS IT'S

03:04:24.753 --> 03:04:25.187
WRITTEN BECAUSE AT THIS

03:04:25.254 --> 03:04:26.955
PARTICULAR ISSUE.

03:04:27.022 --> 03:04:27.856
AND MEMBER GARCIA AND I BELIEVE

03:04:27.923 --> 03:04:28.457
THAT IS IT ANY OTHER MEMBERS

03:04:28.524 --> 03:04:28.957
WISHING TO BE RECOGNIZED

03:04:29.024 --> 03:04:29.258
[inaudible]

03:04:29.324 --> 03:04:29.658
IF NOT [inaudible]

03:04:29.725 --> 03:04:31.326
UP.

03:04:31.393 --> 03:04:33.061
FLOOR IS YOURS AND THEN WILL

03:04:33.128 --> 03:04:34.596
LOVE ASK FOR THE CLOTHES.

03:04:34.663 --> 03:04:37.399
THANK YOU -- WHEN THIS WHEN THIS

03:04:37.466 --> 03:04:39.001
BILL?

03:04:39.067 --> 03:04:40.702
THERE WAS THROUGH AN ARTICLE OR

03:04:40.769 --> 03:04:42.104
DRUGS ALLOW INTEREST CAME BEFORE

03:04:42.171 --> 03:04:43.872
US A FEW WEEKS AGO TWO TWO DAY

03:04:43.939 --> 03:04:44.473
THERE HAVE DEFINITELY BEEN

03:04:44.540 --> 03:04:45.641
AMENDMENTS AND TAKING A NUMBER

03:04:45.707 --> 03:04:46.942
OF US HAVE.

03:04:47.009 --> 03:04:48.410
POINTED OUT DIFFERENT WEAKNESSES

03:04:48.477 --> 03:04:50.679
WITHIN THE BILL AND AND I DO

03:04:50.746 --> 03:04:51.313
WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE

03:04:51.380 --> 03:04:51.914
HAS BEEN MEANT.

03:04:51.980 --> 03:04:53.449
AND AMENDMENTS THERE BUT I THINK

03:04:53.515 --> 03:04:55.083
MY CONCERN IS THE BIGGER PICTURE

03:04:55.150 --> 03:04:56.552
ABOUT A PICTURE.

03:04:56.618 --> 03:04:59.121
OF WHETHER OR NOT WE LOOK THAT

03:04:59.188 --> 03:05:00.456
AND REALLY TOOK SERIOUSLY EIGHT

03:05:00.522 --> 03:05:02.958
THE IDEA OF A DIFFERENT MODEL --

03:05:03.025 --> 03:05:05.227
AND OUR ELECTRICITY SECTOR OUT

03:05:05.294 --> 03:05:06.395
THERE AND WHETHER WE'VE GIVEN

03:05:06.462 --> 03:05:07.663
THAT IN NO TIME AND I DON'T FEEL

03:05:07.729 --> 03:05:08.797
THAT WE HAVE I DON'T KNOW THAT

03:05:08.864 --> 03:05:10.532
THAT WAS EVEN CONSIDERED WHEN

03:05:10.599 --> 03:05:13.368
THE DISCUSSIONS -- STARTED WITH

03:05:13.435 --> 03:05:14.236
THE ADMINISTRATION WITH THE

03:05:14.303 --> 03:05:18.540
AUTHORS OUT THERE IN A DIFFERENT

03:05:18.607 --> 03:05:19.041
STAKEHOLDERS.

03:05:19.107 --> 03:05:20.709
IN DISCUSSIONS WHETHER IT'S TO

03:05:20.776 --> 03:05:22.144
DO MY COLLEAGUES HAVE BEEN TO

03:05:22.211 --> 03:05:23.312
SCHOOL TALKING ABOUT. SEVENTY

03:05:23.378 --> 03:05:24.780
THE FERRY TO HAVE A PUBLIC

03:05:24.847 --> 03:05:26.715
ENTITY WHETHER IT'S IN STOCK

03:05:26.782 --> 03:05:28.383
THEN WITH DIFFERENT FOLKS OUT

03:05:28.450 --> 03:05:29.885
THERE HAVE BROUGHT IT UP BUT IN

03:05:29.952 --> 03:05:31.053
GENERAL MY DISCUSSION IS NOT

03:05:31.119 --> 03:05:32.321
JUST ABOUT THIS PUBLIC ENTITIES

03:05:32.387 --> 03:05:32.988
BUT JUST.

03:05:33.055 --> 03:05:35.357
HAS THE EXPERIMENT WE BEEN DOING

03:05:35.424 --> 03:05:35.924
FIT.

03:05:35.991 --> 03:05:37.960
THE REALITY OF CALIFORNIA NOT

03:05:38.026 --> 03:05:39.061
JUST WITH CLIMATE CHANGE WITH

03:05:39.127 --> 03:05:40.762
WILDFIRES WITH ALL THE OTHER

03:05:40.829 --> 03:05:41.530
POLICIES WE HAVE THEM OF

03:05:41.597 --> 03:05:43.198
RENEWABLES AND EVERYTHING ELSE

03:05:43.265 --> 03:05:43.765
ALONG THE WAY.

03:05:43.832 --> 03:05:45.033
IT'S A CRISIS ALLOWS AN

03:05:45.100 --> 03:05:46.134
OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO HAVE THOSE

03:05:46.201 --> 03:05:47.769
DISCUSSIONS AND I DON'T FEEL

03:05:47.836 --> 03:05:48.837
THAT WE'VE TAKEN ADVANTAGEOF

03:05:48.904 --> 03:05:51.440
THAT OPPORTUNITY AND WE ARE

03:05:51.507 --> 03:05:52.574
WHERE WE HAD TO DO AND AND OUR

03:05:52.641 --> 03:05:53.575
WINDOW HAS CLOSED.

03:05:53.642 --> 03:05:54.476
GIVEN HERE SEVEN YEARS AND I

03:05:54.543 --> 03:05:56.044
HAVE BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE ALL

03:05:56.111 --> 03:05:56.778
SEVEN YEARS.

03:05:56.845 --> 03:05:58.013
AND IT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE THAT

03:05:58.080 --> 03:05:59.748
WHAT WE SAY YES WE'RE GONNA COME

03:05:59.815 --> 03:06:01.116
BACK AND REVISIT THAT WE DON'T --

03:06:01.183 --> 03:06:03.685
AND THAT'S WHERE MY CONCERN

03:06:03.752 --> 03:06:07.489
COMES TO DAY -- WITH WITH WHERE

03:06:07.556 --> 03:06:09.091
WE'RE AT TODAY.

03:06:09.157 --> 03:06:10.826
INSIDE OUT THE ADMINISTRATION

03:06:10.893 --> 03:06:12.394
AND YOU KNOW IF A DIMINISH YOU

03:06:12.461 --> 03:06:14.296
SAID THE GOVERNOR IS GOING TO BE

03:06:14.363 --> 03:06:16.031
JUST AS VALID AS HE WAS WITH

03:06:16.098 --> 03:06:17.399
THIS BILL WITH A BIGGER

03:06:17.466 --> 03:06:18.233
DISCUSSION.

03:06:18.300 --> 03:06:19.768
INTO THE PHALLUS AS FAR AS THE

03:06:19.835 --> 03:06:22.304
TIME LANDING AT AS QUICKLY AS

03:06:22.371 --> 03:06:23.872
POSSIBLE AND ESPECIALLY IF US

03:06:23.939 --> 03:06:26.141
MUSCLE NOT JUST A STRIKE FIRST

03:06:26.208 --> 03:06:26.542
BUT TO DO OTHER.

03:06:26.608 --> 03:06:28.176
THINGS -- BECAUSE I HAVEN'T I'VE

03:06:28.243 --> 03:06:29.811
I HAVEN'T HAD A COMMITMENT FROM

03:06:29.878 --> 03:06:30.913
THE GOVERNOR FOR DIFFERENT

03:06:30.979 --> 03:06:31.980
PEOPLE ON HIS TEAM.

03:06:32.047 --> 03:06:33.715
BUT I ALSO HAVE BEEN HERE LONG

03:06:33.782 --> 03:06:34.883
ENOUGH THAT IF IT'S NOT FROM THE

03:06:34.950 --> 03:06:35.284
BOSS.

03:06:35.350 --> 03:06:36.852
IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

03:06:36.919 --> 03:06:38.720
AND SOTHAT THAT'S THAT'S MY

03:06:38.787 --> 03:06:40.956
COMMENT OF MY CONCERN TODAY I

03:06:41.023 --> 03:06:41.323
DON'T.

03:06:41.390 --> 03:06:43.825
WANT TO REITERATE YOU KNOW THE

03:06:43.892 --> 03:06:44.426
OTHER SHORTCOMINGS THAT HAVE

03:06:44.493 --> 03:06:45.961
HAVEN'T HAD BUT THAT'S MY ISSUE

03:06:46.028 --> 03:06:47.396
WITH THIS ALL ALONG WHETHER IT'S

03:06:47.462 --> 03:06:48.497
TALKING ABOUT.

03:06:48.564 --> 03:06:50.232
INFRASTRUCTURE AND WHETHER THAT

03:06:50.299 --> 03:06:51.900
THAT SHOULD BE.

03:06:51.967 --> 03:06:53.068
ON THE PRIVATE OR PUBLIC SECTOR

03:06:53.135 --> 03:06:54.403
OR GENERATION AND THERE'S

03:06:54.469 --> 03:06:56.004
DIFFERENT PIECES TO THIS BUT I

03:06:56.071 --> 03:06:56.905
DO THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A

03:09:47.109 --> 03:09:50.245
WE HAVE HAD -- THERE'S NOT BEEN

03:09:50.312 --> 03:09:50.812
AN ISSUE THAT I CAN TELL YOU

03:09:50.879 --> 03:09:51.546
SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE MY FIVE

03:09:51.613 --> 03:09:53.281
YEARS INCLUDING CAP AND TRADE.

03:09:53.348 --> 03:09:54.549
WHAT WE HAVE SPENT THIS MUCH

03:09:54.616 --> 03:09:56.051
TIME AND HAD THIS MUCH PUBLIC

03:09:56.118 --> 03:09:58.787
INPUT I INTO A INTO A BILL?

03:09:58.854 --> 03:10:00.455
AND HERE'S THE OTHER FACT IT IS

03:10:00.522 --> 03:10:01.757
TRUE THAT JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO

03:10:01.823 --> 03:10:03.525
WE SAW WE SAW THE THE LANGUAGE

03:10:03.592 --> 03:10:04.960
BEFORE US AND I CAN TELL YOU IS

03:10:05.026 --> 03:10:07.095
THE REPUBLICAN -- THAT -- ENDED

03:10:07.162 --> 03:10:08.897
UP BEING A JOINT AUTHR ON THIS

03:10:08.964 --> 03:10:10.866
BILL I WAS A LITTLE FRUSTRATED

03:10:10.932 --> 03:10:11.867
I'LL TELL YOU AT FIRST NOT

03:10:11.933 --> 03:10:13.268
HAVING ALL THE LANGUAGE WANTED

03:10:13.335 --> 03:10:14.136
TO SEE IT UP FRONT.

03:10:14.202 --> 03:10:16.004
SO I READ WHEN I GOT THAT EVERY

03:10:16.071 --> 03:10:18.073
SINGLE WORD OF OF THAT OF OF

03:10:18.140 --> 03:10:19.775
THAT BILL BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT

03:10:19.841 --> 03:10:20.208
TO LIKE LAST YEAR.

03:10:20.275 --> 03:10:22.210
DIDN'T WANT TO BE TOLD THAT YOU

03:10:22.277 --> 03:10:23.378
DIDN'T READ EVERY SINGLE WORDS I

03:10:23.445 --> 03:10:24.579
READ EVERY SINGLE WORD AND THEN

03:10:24.646 --> 03:10:26.414
I FOUND OUT THAT THERE WERE --

03:10:26.481 --> 03:10:27.783
SEVENTY PAGES OF AMENDMENTS THAT

03:10:27.849 --> 03:10:29.317
I FREAKED OUT ABOUT THOSE

03:10:29.384 --> 03:10:30.786
SEVENTY PAGES OF AMENDMENTS --

03:10:30.852 --> 03:10:32.154
THAT THATCAME UP BE AWARE

03:10:32.220 --> 03:10:33.054
THOUGH THAT THE WEATHER'S A

03:10:33.121 --> 03:10:34.523
MINUTES CAME UP BECAUSE I WASN'T

03:10:34.589 --> 03:10:36.992
THE ONLY ONE HAVING THOSE

03:10:37.058 --> 03:10:37.993
CONVERSATIONS.

03:10:38.059 --> 03:10:38.727
THERE ARE SEE ALL THE

03:10:38.794 --> 03:10:40.028
STAKEHOLDERS BEHIND US THEY'RE

03:10:40.095 --> 03:10:41.863
NOT JUST THE STATE FOR THEIR A

03:10:41.930 --> 03:10:42.497
HUNDRED TWENTY MEMBERS OF THIS

03:10:42.564 --> 03:10:43.799
LEGISLATURE THE ALL HAD AN

03:10:43.865 --> 03:10:45.200
OPINION OF WHAT THIS BILL MIGHT

03:10:45.267 --> 03:10:46.067
LOOK LIKE.

03:10:46.134 --> 03:10:46.902
AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT THAT THE

03:10:46.968 --> 03:10:49.304
BILL BEFORE US TODAY IS NOT ONE

03:10:49.371 --> 03:10:50.338
THAT IF I WAS GOING TO DO A

03:10:50.405 --> 03:10:51.973
DRAFT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE.

03:10:52.040 --> 03:10:53.942
I WON IT THE FACT I CAN TELL YOU

03:10:54.009 --> 03:10:54.910
CAN POINT OUT ALL SORTS OF

03:10:54.976 --> 03:10:56.578
THINGS IN THIS BILL THAT I THAT

03:10:56.645 --> 03:10:57.679
I DON'T LIKE.

03:10:57.746 --> 03:10:58.914
AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US IF WE

03:10:58.980 --> 03:11:00.315
HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE

03:11:00.382 --> 03:11:01.683
TO OFFER THE BILL IT WOULD LOOK

03:11:01.750 --> 03:11:03.451
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT IT IS BEFORE

03:11:03.518 --> 03:11:04.286
US TODAY.

03:11:04.352 --> 03:11:06.321
BUT THE ADMINISTRATION ACT LIKE

03:11:06.388 --> 03:11:07.656
AN EXECUTIVE SHOULD.

03:11:07.722 --> 03:11:09.157
THEY LISTENED TO US THEY BROUGHT

03:11:09.224 --> 03:11:10.959
ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS IN AND THEY

03:11:11.026 --> 03:11:13.261
CRAFTED A COMPROMISE MEASURE AND

03:11:13.328 --> 03:11:14.529
I CAN'T THINK OF A MEASURE THAT

03:11:14.596 --> 03:11:15.664
COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER THAN WHAT

03:11:15.730 --> 03:11:17.098
WE HAVE TODAY.

03:11:17.165 --> 03:11:18.900
AND IT'S FOR THAT REASON BUT

03:11:18.967 --> 03:11:21.069
THIS IS NOT A DEMOCRATIC A BILL

03:11:21.136 --> 03:11:22.838
IT IS NOT A REPUBLICAN BILL IT

03:11:22.904 --> 03:11:24.306
IS A BIPARTISAN BILL IS A NON

03:11:24.372 --> 03:11:26.842
PARTISAN BILL.

03:11:26.908 --> 03:11:27.442
I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE

03:11:27.509 --> 03:11:31.813
VOTE.

03:11:31.880 --> 03:11:35.617
BECAUSE I THINK WE WERE JUST

03:11:35.684 --> 03:11:35.817
GONNA.

03:11:35.884 --> 03:11:36.952
YOU MADE TO CLOSE DOWN.

03:11:37.018 --> 03:11:38.286
WE'RE ALL PLEASED ALL THREE I

03:11:38.353 --> 03:11:38.887
MEAN I DON'T KNOW I GUESS THE

03:11:38.954 --> 03:11:40.755
THING BUT I DO WANT TO ADDRESS

03:11:40.822 --> 03:11:42.691
SOME OF THE REMARKS -- ASSEMBLY

03:11:42.757 --> 03:11:44.125
MEMBER GARCIA I MAY THINK THAT

03:11:44.192 --> 03:11:45.460
BOTH HOLDEN AND THE GOVERNOR'S

03:11:45.527 --> 03:11:47.362
OFFICE IN OUR CONVERSATIONS HAVE

03:11:47.429 --> 03:11:49.331
BEEN VERY CLEAR ABOUT EXPRESSING --

03:11:49.397 --> 03:11:50.665
EXPRESSING THAT THEY ARE GOING

03:11:50.732 --> 03:11:52.434
TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

03:11:52.500 --> 03:11:53.535
WHAT THE FUTURE.

03:11:53.602 --> 03:11:55.170
OF THE UTILITIES LOOKS LIKE AND

03:11:55.237 --> 03:11:57.539
I THINK -- THEY HAVE PROVEN BOTH

03:11:57.606 --> 03:12:00.475
TO LISTEN CAREFULLY AND TO KEEP

03:12:00.542 --> 03:12:02.110
GOOD TO THEIR WORD -- TOO SO

03:12:02.177 --> 03:12:07.148
AMBER EGGMAN I WILL TELL YOU

03:12:07.215 --> 03:12:08.149
THAT.

03:12:08.216 --> 03:12:08.917
BEFORE YOU EVEN SPOKE ON AND I

03:12:08.984 --> 03:12:10.352
HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING WHAT WE

03:12:10.418 --> 03:12:11.219
WILL BUT WHAT WILL BE DONE FOR

03:12:11.286 --> 03:12:12.721
RELIEF FOR BOTH AG AND LARGE

03:12:12.787 --> 03:12:13.788
ENERGY USERS AND WE WILL

03:12:13.855 --> 03:12:14.623
CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT

03:12:14.689 --> 03:12:16.224
CONVERSATION OVER THE BREAK IN.

03:12:16.291 --> 03:12:17.325
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE HAS BEEN

03:12:17.392 --> 03:12:18.193
VERY OPEN ABOUT THOSE

03:12:18.260 --> 03:12:20.762
CONVERSATIONS AND WE HAVE BEEN

03:12:20.829 --> 03:12:22.264
HAVING THEM FOR THE LAST COUPLE

03:12:22.330 --> 03:12:24.532
WEEKS -- THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES

03:12:24.599 --> 03:12:27.035
SURROUNDING THIS FUND AND I

03:12:27.102 --> 03:12:28.603
THINK YOU KNOW AS WE TALK ABOUT

03:12:28.670 --> 03:12:30.071
HARDENING AND PREVENTION AND

03:12:30.138 --> 03:12:31.740
INSURANCE ALL OF THOSE THINGS

03:12:31.806 --> 03:12:33.174
ARE NOT FINISHED.

03:12:33.241 --> 03:12:35.110
WE STILL HAVE OTHER WORK TO DO

03:12:35.176 --> 03:12:36.444
THIS ISN'T THE END OF THE

03:12:36.511 --> 03:12:37.545
CONVERSATION BUT THIS IS A

03:12:37.612 --> 03:12:38.647
PIVOTAL POINT IN THE

03:12:38.713 --> 03:12:39.481
CONVERSATION AND THIS WAS

03:12:39.547 --> 03:12:40.282
SOMETHING.

03:12:40.348 --> 03:12:42.150
THAT CANNOT BE PUSHED ASIDE

03:12:42.217 --> 03:12:45.086
ANYMORE BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEN THE

03:12:45.153 --> 03:12:45.720
COST OF INACTION.

03:12:45.787 --> 03:12:47.689
AND WE HAVE SEEN THE DEVASTATION

03:12:47.756 --> 03:12:49.391
AND I AM SO SORRY TO THOSE

03:12:49.457 --> 03:12:51.126
PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM WHO NOT ONLY

03:12:51.192 --> 03:12:52.527
LOST THEIR HOMES BUT HAVE LOST

03:12:52.594 --> 03:12:53.695
FAMILY MEMBERS.

03:12:53.762 --> 03:12:55.030
AND THAT IS THE COST THAT WE

03:12:55.096 --> 03:12:57.065
HAVE ALL PAID FOR NOT DOING THE

03:12:57.132 --> 03:12:58.199
PREVENTIVE MEASURES THAT WE

03:12:58.266 --> 03:12:59.567
SHOULD HAVE DEMANDED LONG IN

03:12:59.634 --> 03:13:00.902
ADVANCE.

03:13:00.969 --> 03:13:01.870
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

03:13:01.937 --> 03:13:02.837
TESTIFIED IN THE LAST COUPLE

03:13:02.904 --> 03:13:04.472
DAYS HAVE BEEN OUT OF THEIR HOME

03:13:04.539 --> 03:13:06.641
FOR FOURTEEN HUNDRED DAYS.

03:13:06.708 --> 03:13:07.676
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO LIKE YOU

03:13:07.742 --> 03:13:09.711
HEARD TODAY OR ON THEIR PHONES

03:13:09.778 --> 03:13:11.913
WHEN THEY LOST THEIR LOVED ONES.

03:13:11.980 --> 03:13:13.515
WE BEAR SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR

03:13:13.581 --> 03:13:15.150
THAT AND TO NOT ACT WOULD BE OUR

03:13:15.216 --> 03:13:17.452
RESPONSIBILITY SO WE DO HOLD A

03:13:17.519 --> 03:13:18.353
RESPONSIBILITY TO THE PEOPLE OF

03:13:18.420 --> 03:13:20.055
CALIFORNIA TO MAKE SOME ACTION

03:13:20.121 --> 03:13:21.456
AND THIS IS AN ACTION IN WHICH

03:13:21.523 --> 03:13:22.891
WE REQUIRE.

03:13:22.958 --> 03:13:24.793
ACCOUNTABILITY.

03:13:24.859 --> 03:13:26.728
WHERE WE COUNT AS WE REQUIRES A

03:13:26.795 --> 03:13:28.296
SKIN IN THE GAME?

03:13:28.363 --> 03:13:29.731
I'M NOT JUST FROM OURSELVES BUT

03:13:29.798 --> 03:13:31.533
FROM THE UTILITIES -- AND NOT

03:13:31.599 --> 03:13:32.634
FROM IT JUST FOR THE PEOPLE OF

03:13:32.701 --> 03:13:34.636
CALIFORNIA BUT ESPECIALLY FROM

03:13:34.703 --> 03:13:36.371
THOSE WHO HAVE BEHAVED POORLY.

03:13:36.438 --> 03:13:38.239
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

03:13:38.306 --> 03:13:41.142
SO I WOULD SAY -- I I AGREE WITH

03:13:41.209 --> 03:13:43.378
THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEANS A LOT

03:13:43.445 --> 03:13:44.879
OF WORK HAS GONE INTO THIS.

03:13:44.946 --> 03:13:46.614
YES THIS FINAL PRODUCT IS FAIRLY

03:13:46.681 --> 03:13:48.416
NEW BUT WE HAVE SPENT MANY

03:13:48.483 --> 03:13:49.918
PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM HAVE SPENT

03:13:49.985 --> 03:13:50.652
HOURS.

03:13:50.719 --> 03:13:53.421
AND DAYS AND WEEKS AND MONTHS

03:13:53.488 --> 03:13:55.023
WORKING ON THESE ISSUES.

03:13:55.090 --> 03:13:57.058
WE HAVE SPENT OUR FREE TIME OUR

03:13:57.125 --> 03:13:59.427
BREAK TIME OUR WORK TIME BECAUSE

03:13:59.494 --> 03:14:01.396
IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO US.

03:14:01.463 --> 03:14:04.799
SO FOR THOSE WHETHER IT IS THOSE

03:14:04.866 --> 03:14:05.867
IN OPPOSITION OR WHETHER IT IS

03:14:05.934 --> 03:14:08.236
THE NEWSPAPERS YOU'RE WRONG.

03:14:08.303 --> 03:14:09.738
WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS AND

03:14:09.804 --> 03:14:11.206
THIS HAS BEEN IMPORTANT TO BOTH

03:14:11.272 --> 03:14:14.676
THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE.

03:14:14.743 --> 03:14:15.944
I TELL YOU PERSONALLY I WENT TO

03:14:16.011 --> 03:14:16.845
PARADISE AND I SAW THE

03:14:16.911 --> 03:14:18.513
DEVASTATION.

03:14:18.580 --> 03:14:20.982
I SAW YOUNG KIDS WHO WHO NOT

03:14:21.049 --> 03:14:22.484
JUST A RECOVERING FROM A TRAUMA

03:14:22.550 --> 03:14:23.785
BUT ARE AFRAID THAT THEY'RE

03:14:23.852 --> 03:14:25.820
NEVER GOING HOME.

03:14:25.887 --> 03:14:28.656
IT IS INCUMBENT ON US TO ACT.

03:14:28.723 --> 03:14:29.924
AND THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT

03:14:29.991 --> 03:14:31.393
DIRECTION.

03:14:31.459 --> 03:14:33.061
BUT IT IS OUR JOB IT IS OUR

03:14:33.128 --> 03:14:35.163
RESPONSIBILITY AND I

03:14:35.230 --> 03:14:39.901
RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN ITEM.

03:14:39.968 --> 03:14:41.369

03:15:10.198 --> 03:15:11.866
CONVERSATION OVER THE LAST

03:15:11.933 --> 03:15:13.701
SEVERAL YEARS AND ABOUT ALL OF

03:15:13.768 --> 03:15:16.538
YOU HAVE PARTICIPATED AS WELL --

03:15:16.604 --> 03:15:18.106
WE'RE NOT IN IT.

03:15:18.173 --> 03:15:19.874
BY OURSELVES AND WHAT WE'RE

03:15:19.941 --> 03:15:22.777
SEEKING HERE IS A SOLUTION TO A

03:15:22.844 --> 03:15:24.112
CALIFORNIA PROBLEM.

03:15:24.179 --> 03:15:28.349
AND THAT PROBLEM IMPACTS ON OF

03:15:28.416 --> 03:15:30.351
THE RESIDENTS THE VICTIMS.

03:15:30.418 --> 03:15:32.320
OF THE INDUSTRY ITSELF

03:15:32.387 --> 03:15:32.620
[inaudible]

03:15:32.687 --> 03:15:33.822
YOU KNOW.

03:15:33.888 --> 03:15:35.657
I DO WE HAVE THE PERFECT PLAN

03:15:35.723 --> 03:15:38.493
I'LL TELL YOU WE DON'T.

03:15:38.560 --> 03:15:39.828
BUT IT IS AN INCREDIBLY GOOD

03:15:39.894 --> 03:15:41.696
PLAN [inaudible]

03:15:41.763 --> 03:15:43.465
THOUGHTFUL.

03:15:43.531 --> 03:15:46.000
WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

03:15:46.067 --> 03:15:48.069
VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE.

03:15:48.136 --> 03:15:50.572
WHO ARE PORING OVER THE DETAILS

03:15:50.638 --> 03:15:52.574
WHO HAVE ENGAGED WITH US

03:15:52.640 --> 03:15:54.209
THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS

03:15:54.275 --> 03:15:54.509
[inaudible]

03:15:54.576 --> 03:15:58.179
AND BEEN OUT.

03:15:58.246 --> 03:16:00.048
IF WE DO NOTHING.

03:16:00.115 --> 03:16:00.648
WHICH IS THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE

03:16:00.715 --> 03:16:02.383
HERE.

03:16:02.450 --> 03:16:05.053
THIS PLAN OR NOTHING.

03:16:05.120 --> 03:16:06.788
IF WE DO NOTHING.

03:16:06.855 --> 03:16:09.290
WE'VE HEARD THAT.

03:16:09.357 --> 03:16:10.859
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON WILL

03:16:10.925 --> 03:16:13.361
BE DOWNGRADED. TO JUNK BOND

03:16:13.428 --> 03:16:15.363
STATUS.

03:16:15.430 --> 03:16:16.998
THAT MAY MEAN SOME TO SOME MEANS

03:16:17.065 --> 03:16:18.233
SOMETHING TO SOME IT MAY MEAN

03:16:18.299 --> 03:16:20.068
NOTHING TO OTHERS I DON'T KNOW

03:16:20.135 --> 03:16:22.137
IT'S ON EVERYBODY'S MIND HOW

03:16:22.203 --> 03:16:24.205
THEY WANT TO EVALUATE IT.

03:16:24.272 --> 03:16:26.141
AND IF THEY GO TO JUNK BOND

03:16:26.207 --> 03:16:29.010
STATUS.

03:16:29.077 --> 03:16:31.479
AND YOU ALREADY HAVE.

03:16:31.546 --> 03:16:33.781
A UTILITY LAST YEAR THAT WENT TO

03:16:33.848 --> 03:16:35.817
JUNK BOND STATUS.

03:16:35.884 --> 03:16:37.318
AND THEN THERE WAS A

03:16:37.385 --> 03:16:39.087
CATASTROPHIC FIRE.

03:16:39.154 --> 03:16:41.055
IN THEIR TERRITORY AND NOW

03:16:41.122 --> 03:16:43.558
THEY'RE IN BANKRUPTCY.

03:16:43.625 --> 03:16:46.594
WHO BENEFITED BY THAT?

03:16:46.661 --> 03:16:49.697
THE PEOPLE WHO LOST EVERYTHING.

03:16:49.764 --> 03:16:52.100
WERE VICTIMIZED AGAIN.

03:16:52.167 --> 03:16:54.102
BECAUSE THEN THEY WERE DRAGGED.

03:16:54.169 --> 03:16:55.937
INTO BANKRUPTCY WHERE THEY WENT

03:16:56.004 --> 03:16:58.473
TO THE END OF THE LINE

03:16:58.540 --> 03:16:58.773
[inaudible]

03:16:58.840 --> 03:17:00.475
UNSECURED CREDITORS.

03:17:00.542 --> 03:17:02.810
WHO LOST EVERYTHING [inaudible]

03:17:02.877 --> 03:17:05.146
AND NOW.

03:17:05.213 --> 03:17:07.549
THEY STAND TO LOSE AGAIN.

03:17:07.615 --> 03:17:08.750
SO THEN THE QUESTION IS WHAT WE

03:17:08.816 --> 03:17:10.151
DO.

03:17:10.218 --> 03:17:12.687
DO WE LEARN.

03:17:12.754 --> 03:17:13.888
YES IT'S NEW FRONT TIER BUT

03:17:13.955 --> 03:17:16.057
WE'VE NOW LEARNED SOMETHING.

03:17:16.124 --> 03:17:17.325
NOW HOW DO WE REACT TO WHAT

03:17:17.392 --> 03:17:20.061
WE'VE LEARNED.

03:17:20.128 --> 03:17:23.498
THIS IS NOT A PERFECT SOLUTION.

03:17:23.565 --> 03:17:24.933
AND I THINK THAT WE'VE SAID ALL

03:17:24.999 --> 03:17:26.668
ALONG THAT.

03:17:26.734 --> 03:17:29.270
WHAT HAPPENS AFTER TO DAY AFTER

03:17:29.337 --> 03:17:31.005
TOMORROW AFTER THE GOVERNOR

03:17:31.072 --> 03:17:32.407
SIGNS THIS BILL SHOULD GET TO

03:17:32.473 --> 03:17:34.209
THE GOVERNOR'S DESK IS THAT WE

03:17:34.275 --> 03:17:36.110
STILL HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO?

03:17:36.177 --> 03:17:37.612
WE DON'T PACK UP AND GO AWAY

03:17:37.679 --> 03:17:39.647
JUST BECAUSE THIS BILL PASSES

03:17:39.714 --> 03:17:41.349
THERE ARE STAKEHOLDERS TO COME

03:17:41.416 --> 03:17:42.784
TO THE MICROPHONE TODAY THAT WE

03:17:42.850 --> 03:17:45.053
SAID I MADE A COMMITMENT THAT WE

03:17:45.119 --> 03:17:45.987
ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK

03:17:46.054 --> 03:17:47.288
WITH THEM.

03:17:47.355 --> 03:17:50.024
LARGE USERS WHO REPRESENTS.

03:17:50.091 --> 03:17:53.261
CUSTOMERS WHO USE A LOT OF POWER.

03:17:53.328 --> 03:17:55.029
WHO ARE REALLY GOING TO TAKE IT

03:17:55.096 --> 03:17:57.932
ON THE CHIN WITH THIS BILL?

03:17:57.999 --> 03:17:59.133
BUT THEY'RE STANDING HERE EVEN

03:17:59.200 --> 03:18:01.603
THOUGH THEY CAN'T SUPPORT IT.

03:18:01.669 --> 03:18:03.104
BECAUSE IT'S A CALIFORNIA

03:18:03.171 --> 03:18:05.106
PROBLEM THEY'RE SAYING WE'RE

03:18:05.173 --> 03:18:07.609
PREPARED TO STAND WITH YOU.

03:18:07.675 --> 03:18:09.677
AND NOT OPPOSE IT NOT CALL IT A

03:18:09.744 --> 03:18:11.346
BAILOUT BUT SAY THIS IS

03:18:11.412 --> 03:18:13.014
SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO DO AND

03:18:13.081 --> 03:18:14.249
WORK TOGETHER.

03:18:14.315 --> 03:18:18.152
COLLECTIVELY AS ONE CALIFORNIA.

03:18:18.219 --> 03:18:20.355
TO ADDRESS AN ISSUE THAT WE ARE

03:18:20.421 --> 03:18:22.757
ALL IMPACTED BY.

03:18:22.824 --> 03:18:24.759
AND SO I THINK WE STAND HERE

03:18:24.826 --> 03:18:25.360
WITH THE BEST PRODUCT THAT WE

03:18:25.426 --> 03:18:27.095
HAVE.

03:18:27.161 --> 03:18:28.529
RE EITHER MOVE FORWARD IN THE

03:18:28.596 --> 03:18:30.598
MOMENT.

THINKING THAT HEY THIS WILL GET

03:18:31.599 --> 03:18:32.400
US.

03:18:32.467 --> 03:18:35.270
DOWN THE ROAD.

03:18:35.336 --> 03:18:37.205

THINK THAT THE COMMITMENT IS

03:18:44.145 --> 03:18:45.313
THAT THERE'S GOING TO CONTINUE

03:18:45.380 --> 03:18:47.015
TO BE AND ALSO MISS SEGMENTS

03:18:47.081 --> 03:18:48.516

03:18:55.957 --> 03:18:56.190
[inaudible]

03:18:56.257 --> 03:19:01.229
