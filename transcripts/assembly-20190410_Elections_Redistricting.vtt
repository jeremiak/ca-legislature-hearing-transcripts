00:39:17.855 --> 00:39:18.889
BULLARD ON BEHALF OF THE

00:39:18.956 --> 00:39:20.124
AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ARCHITECTS

00:39:20.191 --> 00:39:22.326
CALIFORNIA COUNCIL OF FIRST OF

00:39:22.393 --> 00:39:24.595
ALL WITHOUT ATTEMPTING TO BETTER

00:39:24.662 --> 00:39:26.130
ANYBODY UP THAT THE ANALYSIS.

00:39:26.197 --> 00:39:28.666
WAS REALLY GOOD AT POINTING OUT.

00:39:28.733 --> 00:39:30.735
THAT THE QUESTIONS HERE THERE'S

00:39:30.801 --> 00:39:33.871
NOTHING INTUITIVE ABOUT SECTION

00:39:33.938 --> 00:39:35.406
TEN NINETY AND HOW THIS KICKS IN.

00:39:35.473 --> 00:39:38.275
IT'S AN IMPENETRABLE STATUTE AND

00:39:38.342 --> 00:39:39.510
I THOUGHT IT LAID OUT YOU KNOW

00:39:39.577 --> 00:39:41.312
IF YOU'VE READ IT YOU UNDERSTOOD

00:39:41.378 --> 00:39:43.948
THE PROBLEM HERE -- THE PROBLEM

00:39:44.014 --> 00:39:45.149
IS WE HAVE A STATUTE.

00:39:45.216 --> 00:39:46.884
WHY WOULD ARCHITECTS BE IN THE

00:39:46.951 --> 00:39:48.586
ELECTIONS COMMITTEE YEAH AND WHY

00:39:48.652 --> 00:39:50.121
WOULD THEY BE IMPACTED BY A

00:39:50.187 --> 00:39:53.324
CONFLICT OF INTEREST ON PUBLIC

00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:54.225
OFFICIALS?

00:39:54.291 --> 00:39:55.359
BUT THE PROBLEM IS SEVERE

00:39:55.426 --> 00:39:56.927
BECAUSE THE CONSEQUENCES OF

00:39:56.994 --> 00:39:58.462
VIOLATING THE STATUTE ARE SO

00:39:58.529 --> 00:40:00.498
SEVERE AND IT IS BECOMING AN

00:40:00.564 --> 00:40:02.399
ARTICLE OF FAITH AMONG THE

00:40:02.466 --> 00:40:03.834
ARCHITECTS WE TALKED.

00:40:03.901 --> 00:40:05.369
TO DON'T GET INVOLVED IN IT THE

00:40:05.436 --> 00:40:07.571
EARLY PHASES OF A CONTRACT YOU

00:40:07.638 --> 00:40:10.574
MAY BE DISQUALIFIED FROM THE BIG

00:40:10.641 --> 00:40:12.076
PART PORTIONS OF THE CONTRACT

00:40:12.143 --> 00:40:13.277
WHICH COME LATER.

00:40:13.344 --> 00:40:15.012
AND SO THE THE BILL IS

00:40:15.079 --> 00:40:16.614
ATTEMPTING TO GET THE BEST

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:18.716
PEOPLE IN EARLY TO GIVE THE

00:40:18.783 --> 00:40:20.284
NEEDS ASSESSMENT THE EARLY

00:40:20.351 --> 00:40:22.553
CONSULTATION THAT THE LOCAL

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:24.021
GOVERNMENT NEEDS.

00:40:24.088 --> 00:40:25.256
YOU SHOULD ALSO KNOW THAT WE

00:40:25.322 --> 00:40:27.858

00:40:27.925 --> 00:40:29.593
WITH HOW STATE CONTRACTING IS

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:31.896
DONE UC AND CSU SO THIS ISN'T A

00:40:31.962 --> 00:40:34.732
RADICAL CONCEPT AT ALL IT IS A

00:40:34.799 --> 00:40:36.500
CLARIFICATION -- THERE HAVE BEEN

00:40:36.567 --> 00:40:38.035
ARGUMENTS MADE IT YOU KNOW I'VE

00:40:38.102 --> 00:40:39.436
LOOKED AT IT UP AND DOWN AND I

00:40:39.503 --> 00:40:41.705
DON'T SEE THE LIABILITY ISSUE

00:40:41.772 --> 00:40:43.174
FOR EXAMPLE THE THE QUESTION

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:44.742
AROSE IS THIS RELATE TO

00:40:44.809 --> 00:40:46.243
APPORTIONMENT OF LIABILITY WE

00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:47.144
BELIEVE THAT.

00:40:47.211 --> 00:40:49.346
APPORTIONMENT OF LIABILITY IN

00:40:49.413 --> 00:40:50.915
THE EVENT OF MALPRACTICE WILL.

THIS BILL WILL DO IS.

00:40:57.454 --> 00:41:00.024
A COMMONSENSE READING OF TEN

STAGES OF THE CONTRACT YOU

DISQUALIFIED FROM LATER WORK.

00:41:07.898 --> 00:41:09.166
AND FOR THAT WE THINK THE IT'S

00:41:09.233 --> 00:41:10.701
GOOD FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT IT'S

00:41:10.768 --> 00:41:12.670

THAT THIS BILL IS IN ELECTIONS

00:41:50.374 --> 00:41:51.242
BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF A

00:41:51.308 --> 00:41:52.643
CONVERGENCE OF ELECTIONS AND

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:54.645

CLOSING THE LOOPHOLE.

00:42:01.018 --> 00:42:02.753
WHY IS IT ONLY LIMITED TO DESIGN

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:04.121

BE A CONFLICT WHAT THEY'RE

00:42:11.595 --> 00:42:13.831
TALKING ABOUT IS HOW WHAT WILL

00:42:13.898 --> 00:42:14.064
WORK IN.

00:42:14.131 --> 00:42:15.599
THE REAL WORLD.

00:42:15.666 --> 00:42:17.201
A DESIGN PROFESSIONAL WILL GET A

00:42:17.268 --> 00:42:19.003
PRECONSTRUCTION.

00:42:19.069 --> 00:42:20.404
AGREEMENT SO THEY WILL ASSIST

00:42:20.471 --> 00:42:23.040
THE AGENCY IN DEVELOPING THE

00:42:23.107 --> 00:42:25.409
PLAN FOR CONSTRUCTION.

00:42:25.476 --> 00:42:26.810
THEY COULD THEORETICALLY.

00:42:26.877 --> 00:42:30.514
ALTER THAT PLAN TO CREATE -- AND

00:42:30.581 --> 00:42:31.815
I'M LEVEL PLAYING FIELD AS IT

00:42:31.882 --> 00:42:34.018
RELATES TO THE BIDDING FOR THE

00:42:34.084 --> 00:42:36.420
DESIGN WORK.

00:42:36.487 --> 00:42:38.088
AS THE DESIGNER THEY COULD THEN

00:42:38.155 --> 00:42:40.424
TELL THE PUBLIC AGENCY THAT THEY

00:42:40.491 --> 00:42:42.593
ARE THE ONES WHO SHOULD BE HIRED

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:44.828
AS THE CONSTRUCTION MANAGER.

00:42:44.895 --> 00:42:46.563

REFERRING.

00:42:51.502 --> 00:42:53.637
TO THE ONLY WAY AN AGENCY.

00:42:53.704 --> 00:42:55.639
COULD PROTECT THEMSELVES IS GONE

00:42:55.706 --> 00:42:57.274
RIGHT THERE IS NO OBJECTIVE

00:42:57.341 --> 00:43:00.210
VOICE THE CONSTRUCTION MANAGER

00:43:00.277 --> 00:43:02.713
WOULD HAVE TO BLAME THEMSELVES

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:03.781
FOR DESIGN FLAWS.

00:43:03.847 --> 00:43:05.349
AND CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT.

00:43:05.416 --> 00:43:06.817
WE SCREW THIS UP SO WE'RE GOING

00:43:06.884 --> 00:43:08.619

HAPPEN WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN

00:43:09.787 --> 00:43:11.288
INSTEAD IS THEY'RE GOING TO

00:43:11.355 --> 00:43:13.257
BLAME THE LICENSE CONTRACTORS

00:43:13.324 --> 00:43:14.425
AND SAY WELL THEY DID.

00:43:14.491 --> 00:43:16.493

00:43:18.996 --> 00:43:21.198
NO OBJECTIVE VOICE IN THE

00:43:21.265 --> 00:43:23.667
PROCESS THIS IS WHY.

00:43:23.734 --> 00:43:25.035
IT IS A CONFLICT THAT'S WHY MY

00:43:25.102 --> 00:43:27.271

00:43:27.338 --> 00:43:29.273

WRECK YOU KNOW RECOGNIZE THE

00:43:32.142 --> 00:43:34.912

00:43:42.753 --> 00:43:43.520
THERE'S NO ONE THERE SO WE THINK

00:43:43.587 --> 00:43:45.456
THIS IS BAD POLICY IT'S REMAIN A

00:43:45.522 --> 00:43:48.125

WE DON'T THINK IT'S GOOD POLICY

00:44:00.504 --> 00:44:01.538

00:45:29.626 --> 00:45:31.728
ENTITY OR FIRM SHOULD GET THE

00:45:31.795 --> 00:45:33.363
NEXT PHASE OF THIS PROJECT.

00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:35.232
AND ITS BID EVERY SINGLE STEP OF

00:45:35.299 --> 00:45:36.233
THE WAY.

00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:37.701
WE BELIEVE IT SHOULDN'T BE A

00:45:37.768 --> 00:45:39.470
CONFLICT FOR THEM EITHER YOU

00:45:39.536 --> 00:45:41.338
KNOW THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO TO

00:45:41.405 --> 00:45:42.806
TO BE A PART OF THE EARLY

00:45:42.873 --> 00:45:44.374
CONSTRUCTION PART OF THE PROJECT.

00:45:44.441 --> 00:45:45.943
AND THEN GET FUTURE PHASES THAT

00:45:46.009 --> 00:45:47.778
PROJECT TO IF THEY'RE THE BEST

00:45:47.845 --> 00:45:48.545
FOR HIM FOR THAT.

00:45:48.612 --> 00:45:51.582
AND AND I AGREE I THINK THIS

00:45:51.648 --> 00:45:54.318
THIS CASE -- AND THE HESITANCY

00:45:54.384 --> 00:45:56.053
ON BEHALF OF LOCAL PUBLIC

00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:58.422
ENTITIES IS CATCHING UP US TO US

00:45:58.489 --> 00:46:00.124
NOW BECAUSE WE ARE ON THE FRONT

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:00.457
END.

00:46:00.524 --> 00:46:02.826
OF PROJECTS PRE DESIGN EARLY

00:46:02.893 --> 00:46:05.462
DESIGN STRUCTURAL DESIGN AS

00:46:05.529 --> 00:46:07.030
PROJECTS MOVE ALONG THEY'RE

00:46:07.097 --> 00:46:08.799
GOING TO GET IN THE CONSTRUCTION

00:46:08.866 --> 00:46:11.001
PHASES AND SO I I DON'T DISAGREE

00:46:11.068 --> 00:46:12.536
WE DON'T BELIEVE IT'S A CONFLICT

00:46:12.603 --> 00:46:13.537
FOR US WE DON'T BELIEVE IT'S A

00:46:13.604 --> 00:46:14.671
CONFLICT FOR THEM.

00:46:14.738 --> 00:46:16.607
AS LONG AS QPS IS FOLLOWED WHICH

00:46:16.673 --> 00:46:18.675
IS STATE STATUTE AND AS LONG AS

00:46:18.742 --> 00:46:20.878
EACH PHASES COMPETITIVELY BID

00:46:20.944 --> 00:46:22.713
WITH THE INFORMATION PUT OUT

00:46:22.779 --> 00:46:23.580
THERE SO THAT.

00:46:23.647 --> 00:46:24.815
BIDDERS ON EACH PHASE THE

00:46:24.882 --> 00:46:26.383
PROJECT CAN SEE THE WORK THAT

00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:27.518
WAS DONE BEFORE.

00:46:27.584 --> 00:46:30.087
DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA AT ALL BUT

00:46:30.154 --> 00:46:31.321
BEFORE THERE'S THIS CHILLING

00:46:31.388 --> 00:46:34.291
EFFECT OCCURRED -- THOSE WHO DID

00:46:34.358 --> 00:46:35.526
THE PRE DESIGN WORK -- HOW MANY

00:46:35.592 --> 00:46:36.860
OF THOSE FIRMS ENDED UP GETTING

00:46:36.927 --> 00:46:41.265
THAT THE CONTRACT OR WAS IT IS

00:46:41.331 --> 00:46:42.766
OR ANY?

00:46:42.833 --> 00:46:43.400
ANY DATA ON THAT AT ALL I DON'T

00:46:43.467 --> 00:46:44.034
I DON'T HAVE ANY PRE DATE ON

00:46:44.101 --> 00:46:45.202
THAT BUT I CAN GIVE YOU A MORE

00:46:45.269 --> 00:46:46.737
RECENT EXAMPLE ONE OF OUR

00:46:46.803 --> 00:46:49.339
ENGINEERING FIRMS HAD DID SOME

00:46:49.406 --> 00:46:51.408
PRE DESIGN WORK FOR A WATER

00:46:51.475 --> 00:46:53.377
DISTRICT IN SAN LUIS OBISPO.

00:46:53.443 --> 00:46:55.479
THEY DID THE PRE DESIGN WORK.

00:46:55.546 --> 00:46:57.781
THE THE WATER DISTRICT GOT THAT

00:46:57.848 --> 00:47:00.417
WORK BACK PUT THE NEXT PHASE OUT

00:47:00.484 --> 00:47:01.885
FOR AN RFP.

00:47:01.952 --> 00:47:03.720
THE ENGINEERING FIRM WANTED TO

00:47:03.787 --> 00:47:05.155
BID ON THAT.

00:47:05.222 --> 00:47:06.957
TOO THE WATER DISTRICT ASKED THE

00:47:07.024 --> 00:47:09.092
F. PPC FOR AN OPINION THE F. PPC

00:47:09.159 --> 00:47:10.794
SAID THERE MAY BE A CONFLICT

00:47:10.861 --> 00:47:11.862
HERE YOU NEED TO GATHER MORE

00:47:11.929 --> 00:47:14.932
INFORMATION ABOUT THAT PRE WORK.

00:47:14.998 --> 00:47:16.700
THE WATER DISTRICT DID THAT FELT

00:47:16.767 --> 00:47:17.901
COMFORTABLE THAT THERE WASN'T A

00:47:17.968 --> 00:47:19.169
CONFLICT.

00:47:19.236 --> 00:47:21.271
PUT IT OUT THAT ENGINEERING FIRM

00:47:21.338 --> 00:47:22.539
BID ON THAT CONTRACT DIDN'T GET

00:47:22.606 --> 00:47:24.641
IT.

00:47:24.708 --> 00:47:25.809
BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT THE MOST

00:47:25.876 --> 00:47:27.711
QUALIFIED BIDDER FOR THAT NEXT

00:47:27.778 --> 00:47:29.913
PHASE AND SO TO SUGGEST THAT

00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:31.281
SOMEHOW.

00:47:31.348 --> 00:47:32.783
THESE THINGS CAN ALWAYS BE

00:47:32.849 --> 00:47:35.519
SKEWED IN THE FAVOR OF THE OF

00:47:35.586 --> 00:47:37.454
THE FIRM THAT DID THE EARLIER --

00:47:37.521 --> 00:47:39.590
THE EARLIER WORK IT'S JUST FALLS

00:47:39.656 --> 00:47:41.925
IT DOESN'T ALWAYS OCCUR THAT WAY

00:47:41.992 --> 00:47:44.094
SOMETIMES AND EVEN THE F. PPC.

00:47:44.161 --> 00:47:45.562
POINTED OUT THEIR MOST RECENT

00:47:45.629 --> 00:47:47.431
OPINION SOMETIMES THERE'S A GOOD

00:47:47.497 --> 00:47:49.666
PUBLIC POLICY REASON. FOR THE

00:47:49.733 --> 00:47:51.335
SAME FIRM TO BE DOING YOU KNOW

00:47:51.401 --> 00:47:53.036
DIFFERENT PHASES OF WORK AND

00:47:53.103 --> 00:47:55.105
THAT'S OKAY THAT IS NOT A

00:47:55.172 --> 00:47:57.941
CONFLICT.

00:47:58.008 --> 00:47:58.976
MICHELLE I'M GONNA MOVE THE BILL

00:47:59.042 --> 00:48:00.711
TODAY -- BUT I THINK THERE'S

00:48:00.777 --> 00:48:02.045
PROBABLY NEED TO BE SOME

00:48:02.112 --> 00:48:03.180
ASSURANCES.

00:48:03.247 --> 00:48:04.648
ON THIS BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT

00:48:04.715 --> 00:48:06.450
THE AUTHOR -- BUT WOULD WOULD

00:48:06.516 --> 00:48:08.018
BRING FOR THE BILL -- THAT IS

00:48:08.085 --> 00:48:10.254
GOING TO ALLOW FOR A FOR

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:11.455
INCREASED CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

00:48:11.521 --> 00:48:12.289
AND I'M A I WOULD IMAGINE THAT

00:48:12.356 --> 00:48:13.624
THE AUTHORS GONNA CONTINUE TO

00:48:13.690 --> 00:48:14.524
WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO MAKE

00:48:14.591 --> 00:48:15.192
SURE.

00:48:15.259 --> 00:48:16.093
OF THAT WOULD THAT WE GET SOME

00:48:16.159 --> 00:48:18.161
CLARIFICATION OF CLARIFICATIONS

00:48:18.228 --> 00:48:21.031
NEEDED SOME OF THE BILL.

00:48:21.098 --> 00:48:22.633
THANK YOU IN MOTION THE SECOND

00:48:22.699 --> 00:48:23.634
BY SIR GALLAGHER.

00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:25.669
YES SO I MEAN HEY LOOK IN THIS

00:48:25.736 --> 00:48:27.571
OVER IT'S IT'S REALLY NOT I

00:48:27.638 --> 00:48:29.506
THINK IT IS A PRETTY COMPLEX

00:48:29.573 --> 00:48:30.207
ISSUE.

00:48:30.274 --> 00:48:32.442
AND I GUESS.

00:48:32.509 --> 00:48:33.610
MY UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS BILL

00:48:33.677 --> 00:48:35.312
WOULD DO AT LEAST IN CURRENT

00:48:35.379 --> 00:48:37.381
FORM IS SORT OF PROVIDE A

00:48:37.447 --> 00:48:39.983
BLANKET EXEMPTION. FOR CERTAIN

00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:44.554
DESIGN PROFESSIONALS ARCHITECTS.

00:48:44.621 --> 00:48:46.757
AND SAY THERE IS NO CONFLICT OF

00:48:46.823 --> 00:48:49.660
INTEREST IS THAT CORRECT.

00:48:49.726 --> 00:48:51.862
WELL I WAS GOING TO ADD HERE IS

00:48:51.928 --> 00:48:55.999
ON AND I AM VERY MUCH WILLING TO

00:48:56.066 --> 00:48:57.567
SIT DOWN AND TALK TO THEM SOME

00:48:57.634 --> 00:48:58.902
OF THE OPPOSITION.

00:48:58.969 --> 00:49:00.604
BUT IN THIS CASE WERE SPEAKING

00:49:00.671 --> 00:49:03.640
JUST ABOUT THE ARCHITECTS BUT

00:49:03.707 --> 00:49:05.008
THAT DOESN'T PRECLUDE THAT WE

00:49:05.075 --> 00:49:06.910
COULDN'T GO BACK AND LOOK AT

00:49:06.977 --> 00:49:09.646
OTHER -- ENTITIES I THINK ONE OF

00:49:09.713 --> 00:49:10.881
THE THINGS IS TO MAKE THE

00:49:10.947 --> 00:49:14.151
ASSUMPTION IS THAT JUST BECAUSE

00:49:14.217 --> 00:49:15.619
SOMEBODY HAS WORKED ON THE

00:49:15.686 --> 00:49:17.287
DESIGN PHASE THAT ACT

00:49:17.354 --> 00:49:18.722
AUTOMATICALLY MEANS THEY'RE

00:49:18.789 --> 00:49:21.024
GOING TO GO TO THE NEXT PHASES I

00:49:21.091 --> 00:49:22.392
MEAN LIKE I SAID I'VE BEEN ON

00:49:22.459 --> 00:49:24.361
SOME OF THE REGIONAL BOARD

00:49:24.428 --> 00:49:25.228
SANITATION.

00:49:25.295 --> 00:49:27.731
THAT HAS HUGE CONTRACTS AND THAT

00:49:27.798 --> 00:49:29.032
IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE THE

00:49:29.099 --> 00:49:31.301
OPPOSITE OF IT IS ALSO THE

00:49:31.368 --> 00:49:33.937
REVERSE WHERE YOU MAY.

00:49:34.004 --> 00:49:36.473
GO OUT FOR AN RFP I ON THE BOARD

00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:38.875
MAKES A DECISION BASED ON MANY

00:49:38.942 --> 00:49:40.377
FACTORS WHETHER IT'S COST

00:49:40.444 --> 00:49:42.813
pWHETHER IT'S QUALIFICATIONS AND

00:49:42.879 --> 00:49:45.015
THEN LATER ON BECAUSE OF CHANGE

00:49:45.082 --> 00:49:46.783
ORDERS YOU HAVE QUITE A BIT OF

00:49:46.850 --> 00:49:48.618
DIFFERENCE IN WHAT WAS INITIALLY

00:49:48.685 --> 00:49:49.519
PRESENTED.

00:49:49.586 --> 00:49:52.222
SO -- AS FAR AS THIS CONFLICT

00:49:52.289 --> 00:49:54.091
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- I

00:49:54.157 --> 00:49:55.225
THINK RIGHT NOW IT'S VERY

00:49:55.292 --> 00:49:57.027
SPECIFIC.

00:49:57.094 --> 00:49:58.862
TO THE ARCHITECTS BUT IT DOES

00:49:58.929 --> 00:50:00.497
NOT MEAN WE'RE NOT WILLING TO

00:50:00.564 --> 00:50:03.934
LOOK AT TO EXPANSION OR EVEN NOT

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.936
WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION VERY

00:50:06.002 --> 00:50:06.870
CAREFULLY WILL BUT SO THAT

00:50:06.937 --> 00:50:08.138
READING IS IT'S ENGINEERED

00:50:08.205 --> 00:50:11.975
GEOLOGIST ARCHITECT LAND

00:50:12.042 --> 00:50:13.343
SURVEYOR OR PLANNER.

00:50:13.410 --> 00:50:14.111
RIGHT REFORM IN SPECIFIED

00:50:14.177 --> 00:50:15.245
SERVICES ON A PROJECTS SO

00:50:15.312 --> 00:50:16.146
THERE'S SEVERAL DIFFERENT OF THE

00:50:16.213 --> 00:50:18.315
DESIGN THE DESIGN TEAM IN

00:50:18.382 --> 00:50:20.117
ESSENCE BUT WHAT I'M SAYING WHAT

00:50:20.183 --> 00:50:21.518
I'M GETTING AT IS IS THIS SAYING

00:50:21.585 --> 00:50:23.286
THAT HEY THEY CAN NEVER BE FOUND

00:50:23.353 --> 00:50:26.022
TO HAVE A CONFLICT UNDER.

00:50:26.089 --> 00:50:27.224
TEN NINETY IF THIS BILL PASSES

00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:28.759
IT'S IT'S A BLANKET EXEMPTION IF

00:50:28.825 --> 00:50:29.793
THEY WERE INVOLVED IN THE PRE

00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:31.261
CONSTRUCTION WORK THEY CAN NEVER

00:50:31.328 --> 00:50:33.563
BE FOUND TO HAVE A CONFLICT IS

00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:34.364
NOT CORRECT.

00:50:34.431 --> 00:50:36.266
NOT THAT I'M UNDERSTANDING IT

00:50:36.333 --> 00:50:37.434
THAT WAY YEAH I KNOW THAT I'M

00:50:37.501 --> 00:50:38.802
ROGER PALM PRESIDENT RICK

00:50:38.869 --> 00:50:41.505
ENGINEERING COMPANY -- AND A

00:50:41.571 --> 00:50:44.174
MEMBER OF A CC WE'VE WORKED --

00:50:44.241 --> 00:50:45.976
MY MEMBERSHIP -- WITH AN

00:50:46.042 --> 00:50:47.444
ORGANIZATION FOR NUMBER YEARS ON

00:50:47.511 --> 00:50:48.578
THIS.

00:50:48.645 --> 00:50:51.014
THIS THIS BILL IF IT WERE PASSED

00:50:51.081 --> 00:50:53.517
IN ITS CURRENT FORM WOULD NOT

00:50:53.583 --> 00:50:55.185
PRECLUDE IT WOULD NOT BY

00:50:55.252 --> 00:50:57.120
STATUTES SAY THAT THERE IS NO

00:50:57.187 --> 00:50:58.855
CONFLICT OF INTEREST YOU WOULD

00:50:58.922 --> 00:50:59.790
SAY BY STATUTE.

00:50:59.856 --> 00:51:02.192
THAT THERE ISN'T NECESSARILY A

00:51:02.259 --> 00:51:03.627
CONFLICT.

00:51:03.693 --> 00:51:08.665
IT WOULD ENABLE -- A PUBLIC

00:51:08.732 --> 00:51:10.133
AGENCY.

00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:11.802
TO SELECT A A PARTICULAR DESIGN

00:51:11.868 --> 00:51:13.170
PROFESSIONALS TO PERFORM

00:51:13.236 --> 00:51:15.105
SUBSEQUENT SERVICE DOESN'T TELL

00:51:15.172 --> 00:51:16.573
THEM TO DO THAT.

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:17.407
BUT IT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY

00:51:17.474 --> 00:51:19.743
PRECLUDE THEM FROM BEING ABLE TO

00:51:19.810 --> 00:51:22.679
PROVIDE THOSE OVER FOR SERVICES.

00:51:22.746 --> 00:51:24.948
IN IN A PUBLIC AGENCY IS AS IT

00:51:25.015 --> 00:51:28.118
WOULD ALLOW THE PUBLIC AGENCY

00:51:28.185 --> 00:51:30.053
THAT CHOICE. TWO SELECT A NEW

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:31.855
CONSULT IF THEY'RE DOING THE

00:51:31.922 --> 00:51:33.056
PROJECT IN MULTIPLE FACES.

00:51:33.123 --> 00:51:34.424
REDOING A PRELIMINARY DESIGN

00:51:34.491 --> 00:51:36.660
PHASE THE SUB TO THE WE DECIDE

00:51:36.726 --> 00:51:37.227
FOR EXAMPLE THAT THEY HAVE

00:51:37.294 --> 00:51:39.229
FUNDING AND ABLE TO MOVE THE

00:51:39.296 --> 00:51:41.398
PROJECT ON TO THE NEXT PHASE.

00:51:41.465 --> 00:51:42.132
THEY WOULD.

00:51:42.199 --> 00:51:44.034
THEY WOULD UNLESS THERE WAS SOME

00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:46.102
OTHER EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES

00:51:46.169 --> 00:51:48.939
OUTLINED IN A IN IN THE BILL

00:51:49.005 --> 00:51:49.773
THEY WOULD BE.

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:51.842
THAT BY STATUTE THEY WOULD BE

00:51:51.908 --> 00:51:54.377
PRECLUDED FROM USING THE SAME

00:51:54.444 --> 00:51:55.879
DESIGN.

00:51:55.946 --> 00:51:59.015
FOR HER SUBSEQUENT FATE.

00:51:59.082 --> 00:52:00.183
IT WOULD ALLOW THEM.

00:52:00.250 --> 00:52:02.752
BUT IT WOULDN'T COME HELD THEM.

00:52:02.819 --> 00:52:04.588
TO USE THAT SAME CARD.

00:52:04.654 --> 00:52:06.122
RIGHT BUT ISN'T THAT KIND OF

00:52:06.189 --> 00:52:07.791
CURRENT LAW AS WELL BECAUSE LIKE

00:52:07.858 --> 00:52:09.159
AS YOU SAID MOST OF THE TIME

00:52:09.226 --> 00:52:11.528
THAT AT PPC HAS WEIGHED IN ON

00:52:11.595 --> 00:52:12.996
THIS THEY FOUND THAT THERE ISN'T

00:52:13.063 --> 00:52:15.332
A CONFLICT HOWEVER.

00:52:15.398 --> 00:52:16.900
THERE HAVE BEEN CASES.

00:52:16.967 --> 00:52:19.503
WHERE THEY HAVE FOUND -- SO FOR

00:52:19.569 --> 00:52:21.771
EXAMPLE FROM THE ANALYSIS THERE

00:52:21.838 --> 00:52:25.175
WAS A SIMON ADVICE LETTER.

00:52:25.242 --> 00:52:26.643
IN REACHING THAT CONCLUSION THAT

00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:27.777
THERE WAS A CONFLICT THE F. B.

00:52:27.844 --> 00:52:29.713
PC NOTED THAT THE ARCHITECTURAL

00:52:29.779 --> 00:52:31.314
FIRM WAS ENTER CURRENT

00:52:31.381 --> 00:52:33.183
INTEGRALLY INVOLVED IN THE

00:52:33.250 --> 00:52:34.684
PRELIMINARY DISCUSSIONS.

00:52:34.751 --> 00:52:36.720
NEGOTIATIONS REASONING PLANNING

00:52:36.786 --> 00:52:38.655
AND SPECIFICATIONS THAT WILL

00:52:38.722 --> 00:52:40.123
RESULT IN THE CONTRACT FOR

00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:41.825
ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN.

00:52:41.892 --> 00:52:43.827
OF A NEW JAIL AND AND THEREFORE

00:52:43.894 --> 00:52:45.829
HAS THE POTENTIAL. TO EXERT

00:52:45.896 --> 00:52:47.397
CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE OVER THE

00:52:47.464 --> 00:52:50.867
COUNTIES DECISIONS CONCERNING --

00:52:50.934 --> 00:52:51.535
ZONING ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER

00:52:51.601 --> 00:52:53.470
I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES ISN'T

00:52:53.537 --> 00:52:54.671
THAT THEY COULDN'T.

00:52:54.738 --> 00:52:56.172
FIND A CONFLICT OR THAT THEY

00:52:56.239 --> 00:52:58.208
COULD I THINK IT'S THE CLARITY.

00:52:58.275 --> 00:53:00.744
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THERE'S THIS

00:53:00.810 --> 00:53:02.279
NARRATIVE.

00:53:02.345 --> 00:53:04.514
THAT IF YOU START WITH THE

00:53:04.581 --> 00:53:08.351
DESIGN PHASE THEN IT RISKY TO

00:53:08.418 --> 00:53:11.021
MOVE TO THE NEXT PART OF THE

00:53:11.087 --> 00:53:13.690
PROJECT AND IN ORDER TO BE

00:53:13.757 --> 00:53:14.558
EXTREME.

00:53:14.624 --> 00:53:17.761
IN ESSENCE A SAFE VERSUS SORRY

00:53:17.827 --> 00:53:20.196
THERE'S THERE'S COLLUDED RIGHT

00:53:20.263 --> 00:53:21.264
THEY'RE MAKING THAT DECISION

00:53:21.331 --> 00:53:23.633
THEMSELVES WITHOUT EVEN GOING

00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:26.636
THROUGH THE F. T. C. C. N. SO

00:53:26.703 --> 00:53:27.904
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE F. T.

00:53:27.971 --> 00:53:28.972
C. C..

00:53:29.039 --> 00:53:30.674
STILL WOULDN'T SAY THERE'S A

00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:32.742
CONFLICT DEPENDING ON THE

00:53:32.809 --> 00:53:34.911
PROJECT I MEAN I THINK THAT EACH

00:53:34.978 --> 00:53:37.113
ONE OF THESE CASES END OF IT IS

00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:38.782
INDIVIDUALLY LOOKED AT SO YOU'RE

00:53:38.848 --> 00:53:40.016
SAYING THAT WOULD JUST REALLY

00:53:40.083 --> 00:53:41.351
QUICKLY SO YOU'RE SAYING IN.

00:53:41.418 --> 00:53:45.422
IN YOUR COMPANY'S CASE YOU'LL

00:53:45.488 --> 00:53:46.389
EVEN EXCLUDE YOURSELVES FROM.

00:53:46.456 --> 00:53:47.057
OTHER WORK ON THE JOB OTHER WORK

00:53:47.123 --> 00:53:48.925
ON A PARTICULAR JOB BECAUSE

00:53:48.992 --> 00:53:50.293
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT THIS.

00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:51.895
ABSOLUTELY.

00:53:51.962 --> 00:53:53.263
IF THERE'S A LOCAL PAYS FOR A

00:53:53.330 --> 00:53:55.265
PROJECT IT'S REALLY SIMPLE DAY

00:53:55.332 --> 00:53:57.067
TYPICALLY NOT NECESSARILY ALWAYS

00:53:57.133 --> 00:53:58.068
BUT TYPICALLY THE FRONT END OF A

00:53:58.134 --> 00:54:00.370
PROJECT FOR LIMON EVERY SERVICES.

00:54:00.437 --> 00:54:02.005
INVOLVES A LESSER AND LOWERED

00:54:02.072 --> 00:54:02.872
FEET.

00:54:02.939 --> 00:54:06.276
THAT L. HIGHER FEE IS USUALLY

00:54:06.343 --> 00:54:07.410
ATTENDED WITH THE PROPRIETORS

00:54:07.477 --> 00:54:08.878
PREPARATION OF CONSTRUCTION

00:54:08.945 --> 00:54:10.513
DOCUMENTS AND SPECIFICATIONS

00:54:10.580 --> 00:54:11.648
RIGHT IF YOU FEEL THAT YOU'RE

00:54:11.715 --> 00:54:13.850
WELL QUALIFIED TO DO EITHER BUT

00:54:13.917 --> 00:54:15.051
YOU KNOW THAT YOU'VE GOT A

00:54:15.118 --> 00:54:17.721
CHANCE TO DO ONE OR THE OTHER.

00:54:17.787 --> 00:54:19.222
SOME FIRMS AND WHERE ONE OF THEM

00:54:19.289 --> 00:54:20.957
HAVE IT TIMES DECIDED WE'RE

00:54:21.024 --> 00:54:22.225
GONNA KEEP OUR POWDER DRY ON THE

00:54:22.292 --> 00:54:23.660
FRONT END OF THIS PROJECT

00:54:23.727 --> 00:54:24.794
BELIEVING THAT THERE WILL BE A

00:54:24.861 --> 00:54:30.200
SECOND PHASE AND THEN COMPETE

00:54:30.266 --> 00:54:30.634
ONLY ON THE BACKEND.

00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:33.470
OKAY [inaudible]

00:54:33.536 --> 00:54:34.504
YES IN.

00:54:34.571 --> 00:54:35.171
SO WHAT I STRUGGLE WITH THE JUST

00:54:35.238 --> 00:54:35.805
A LITTLE BIT HERE IS BECAUSE I

00:54:35.872 --> 00:54:36.406
CAN SEE THAT THERE COULD BE

00:54:36.473 --> 00:54:38.508
CONFLICTS YOU KNOW AND AND I

00:54:38.575 --> 00:54:40.243
THINK THERE'S INSTANCES FOR

00:54:40.310 --> 00:54:41.711
EXAMPLE WHERE THERE'S MAYBE.

00:54:41.778 --> 00:54:43.480
YEAH EVEN IN SMALL TOWNS WHERE

00:54:43.546 --> 00:54:44.648
THERE'S ONLY.

00:54:44.714 --> 00:54:46.182
ONE YOU KNOW GROUP IN TOWN AND

00:54:46.249 --> 00:54:48.385
THEY HELP TO THE KIDS THE DESIGN

00:54:48.451 --> 00:54:50.220
AND AND ULTIMATELY YOU KNOW

00:54:50.286 --> 00:54:51.655
SURPRISE SURPRISE THEY GET THE

00:54:51.721 --> 00:54:52.722
CONTRACT.

00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:54.057
YOU KNOW DOWN THE ROAD I MEAN

00:54:54.124 --> 00:54:56.393
SAID THERE THERE IS ESPECIALLY

00:54:56.459 --> 00:54:57.861
WHEN THERE'S A LOT OF

00:54:57.927 --> 00:54:59.229
INVOLVEMENT ON THE FRONT I'M

00:54:59.295 --> 00:55:01.698
WITH HOW THIS THING GET SET UP.

00:55:01.765 --> 00:55:03.199
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING

00:55:03.266 --> 00:55:05.001
FOR I THINK THERE COULD BE

00:55:05.068 --> 00:55:06.970
ISSUES OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST

00:55:07.037 --> 00:55:08.872
TEN NINETY IS A REALLY HARSH.

00:55:08.938 --> 00:55:12.275
STANDARD AS WE KNOW AND AND AND

00:55:12.342 --> 00:55:12.909
I THINK THE OTHER ISSUE HERE IS

00:55:12.976 --> 00:55:14.377
THAT USUALLY.

00:55:14.444 --> 00:55:15.478
AT LEAST THE WAY I'VE ALWAYS

00:55:15.545 --> 00:55:16.813
HEARD EXPLAINED TEN NINETY IS

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:18.048
REALLY SPECIFICALLY GEARED

00:55:18.114 --> 00:55:19.883
TOWARDS ELECTED OFFICIALS AND

00:55:19.949 --> 00:55:21.451
PUBLIC EMPLOYEES.

00:55:21.518 --> 00:55:23.787
IT'S NOT REALLY THE INTENT OF IT

00:55:23.853 --> 00:55:27.123
IS NOT TO GO AFTER CONTRACTORS --

00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:29.059
HOWEVER SINCE WHERE THEY GET SO

00:55:29.125 --> 00:55:30.860
INTER TWINED IN THE DECISION

00:55:30.927 --> 00:55:32.462
MAKING.

00:55:32.529 --> 00:55:33.763
THAT THERE COULD BE AN ISSUE AND

00:55:33.830 --> 00:55:34.197
SO.

00:55:34.264 --> 00:55:35.298
THAT'S A MAN THAT'S WHY I THINK

00:55:35.365 --> 00:55:36.433
I KIND OF STRUGGLE WITH THIS

00:55:36.499 --> 00:55:37.600
BILL LITTLE BIT THERE COULD BE

00:55:37.667 --> 00:55:39.235
THE THE CONFLICT.

00:55:39.302 --> 00:55:41.438
BUT AS YOU SAY -- AND IN MANY

00:55:41.504 --> 00:55:43.073
CASES THERE REALLY ISN'T AS

00:55:43.139 --> 00:55:44.708
PRECLUDING GOOD PEOPLE FROM

00:55:44.774 --> 00:55:46.976
BILLION -- PROJECTS -- AND I

00:55:47.043 --> 00:55:48.111
THINK IT IS BECAUSE OF THE

00:55:48.178 --> 00:55:49.646
DILEMMA IT I MEAN I I'VE SAID

00:55:49.713 --> 00:55:51.114
PROBABLY THREE TIMES TO MY LOCAL

00:55:51.181 --> 00:55:52.515
COUNCIL DAYS.

00:55:52.582 --> 00:55:56.319
I IT YOU MAY HAVE AN INITIAL.

00:55:56.386 --> 00:55:58.521
ARCHITECT DESIGN FIRM THAT DOES

00:55:58.588 --> 00:56:00.724
INDEED GET THE NEXT PART OF THE

00:56:00.790 --> 00:56:03.493
PHASE AND IF YOU ANALYZE THAT IS

00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:05.195
WELL I MEAN IF THERE'S ONLY.

00:56:05.261 --> 00:56:06.496
ONE IN A SMALL CITY OF THERE'S

00:56:06.563 --> 00:56:07.897
ONLY ONE BIG FIRM.

00:56:07.964 --> 00:56:09.432
THERE ARE IN ANY THEY'RE USING

00:56:09.499 --> 00:56:11.267
THIS THIS PRACTICE IN THAT VERY

00:56:11.334 --> 00:56:13.136
WELL COULD BE ON THE OTHER HAND

00:56:13.203 --> 00:56:14.804
IF YOU HAVE MULTIPLE FIRMS I

00:56:14.871 --> 00:56:16.039
KNOW.

00:56:16.106 --> 00:56:18.108
IN FULLER TEN WE YOU I WAS PART

00:56:18.174 --> 00:56:20.343
OF THE LAST MAJOR REDEVELOPMENT

00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:21.678
PROJECT.

00:56:21.745 --> 00:56:23.580
THAT WE HAD IN SOME OF THOSE

00:56:23.646 --> 00:56:25.749
WERE SUBSTANTIAL THIRTY MILLION

00:56:25.815 --> 00:56:28.284
DOLLAR PROJECTS TO TO DESIGN

00:56:28.351 --> 00:56:30.186
REDO A LIBRARY COMMUNITY CENTER

00:56:30.253 --> 00:56:31.621
SOME OF THESE PROJECTS.

00:56:31.688 --> 00:56:34.390
AND WE DID IN FACT USE THE SAME

00:56:34.457 --> 00:56:37.127
FIRM FOR BOTH PROJECTS ON THE

00:56:37.193 --> 00:56:37.927
OTHER HAND THERE WERE OTHER

00:56:37.994 --> 00:56:39.929
PROJECTS THAT WE DID NOT USE

00:56:39.996 --> 00:56:41.164
THEM BUT WE DID USE THE SAME

00:56:41.231 --> 00:56:43.933
FIRM FROM BEGINNING. TO END ON

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.401
TWO PROJECTS I CAN THINK OF BUT

00:56:45.468 --> 00:56:48.204
WE HAD MULTIPLE PROJECTS THAT WE

00:56:48.271 --> 00:56:50.173
DIDN'T USE THEM.

00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:52.308
FOR THANK.

00:56:52.375 --> 00:56:53.676
DID TO JUST ONE LAST POINT. ONE

00:56:53.743 --> 00:56:54.644
LAST POINT YOU KNOW I THINK WE

00:56:54.711 --> 00:56:56.479
RECOGNIZE WE COULD USE SOME FINE

00:56:56.546 --> 00:56:59.048
TUNING AS WE MOVE ALONG HERE --

00:56:59.115 --> 00:56:59.916
ONE OF THAT ONE OF THE LETTERS

00:56:59.983 --> 00:57:01.851
THAT WAS GIVEN TO THE COMMITTEE

00:57:01.918 --> 00:57:03.219
RAISE THE ISSUE OF DESIGN BUILD

00:57:03.286 --> 00:57:04.187
WE'VE ALREADY OFFERED AN

00:57:04.254 --> 00:57:06.089
AMENDMENT TO EXEMPT DESIGN BUILD

00:57:06.156 --> 00:57:07.724
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN SPECIFIC

00:57:07.791 --> 00:57:08.958
STATUTES WITH RESPECT TO

00:57:09.025 --> 00:57:10.527
CONFLICT FOR DESIGN BUILD.

00:57:10.593 --> 00:57:11.861
WAS NOT OUR INTENT TO GO AFTER

00:57:11.928 --> 00:57:13.663
THOSE THINGS AND SO WE ARE

00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:15.365
ABSOLUTELY WILLING TO KEEP FINE

00:57:15.431 --> 00:57:16.933
TUNING IS THE BILL MOVES THROUGH

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.301
THE PROCESS GREAT THANK YOU VERY

00:57:18.368 --> 00:57:20.637
MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR

00:57:20.703 --> 00:57:23.439
COMMENTS FROM COLLEAGUES.

00:57:23.506 --> 00:57:24.007
SO I THINK WHAT OFFER CLICK

00:57:24.073 --> 00:57:24.641
IMAGE CHAIRS AGAIN LISTEN IS

00:57:24.707 --> 00:57:25.241
CONVERSATION OR ALRIGHT ABOUT

00:57:25.308 --> 00:57:26.543
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WE WANT TO

00:57:26.609 --> 00:57:27.744
MAKE SURE THAT WE BUT WE KEEP

00:57:27.811 --> 00:57:29.345
THE PUBLIC'S TRUST.

EVEN BE EVEN IN REGARDS TO

00:57:30.413 --> 00:57:31.848
BIDDING I THINK ABOUT THE SMALL

00:57:31.915 --> 00:57:33.583
COMMUNITIES AND VERY SMALL

00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:35.018
PROJECTS THIS IS WHEN THIS

00:57:35.084 --> 00:57:36.052
BECOMES.

00:57:36.119 --> 00:57:38.054
REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE

YOU MIGHT NOT GET ENOUGH BEDS --

00:57:39.622 --> 00:57:41.291
YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE SOMEBODY BED

00:57:41.357 --> 00:57:42.192
AFTER THE DOING THE PLUMBER

00:57:42.258 --> 00:57:44.127
DESIGN WORK TO ACTUALLY DO DO TO

00:57:44.194 --> 00:57:46.996
DO THE PROJECT AND SO -- AGAIN

00:57:47.063 --> 00:57:48.431
MY WILL JUST BEFORE MAKING THE

00:57:48.498 --> 00:57:49.766

LEGISLATION TO SUPERSEDE THE

00:58:09.352 --> 00:58:11.354
CONFLICT OF INTEREST PROVISIONS

THAT ARE ALREADY PRESENT UNDER

00:58:13.056 --> 00:58:14.190
DESIGN BUILD.

00:58:14.257 --> 00:58:16.326
AUTHORIZING STATUTES AND WE

00:58:16.392 --> 00:58:18.161

YOUR STANDARDS.

THE BODY.

01:05:05.368 --> 01:05:07.536

TO THE BALLOT I THINK OR THEY

01:06:25.748 --> 01:06:28.651
DON'T HAVE TO GO THE BALLOT THEY

01:06:28.718 --> 01:06:30.052
COULD DO IT THEMSELVES.

01:06:30.119 --> 01:06:31.153
WHAT THE I MEAN THE THESE ARE

01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:32.288
ENTITIES OF THE STATE OKAY SO

01:06:32.355 --> 01:06:33.689
I'LL HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES

01:06:42.031 --> 01:06:43.199
DIEGO IS IS INTERESTING IT'S

01:06:43.265 --> 01:06:45.868
IT'S A IT'S A BIG CITY THAT JUST

01:06:45.935 --> 01:06:47.737
BECAME BIG IN MENTALITY IN THE

01:06:47.803 --> 01:06:49.171
LAST FEW YEARS.

01:06:49.238 --> 01:06:50.906
YOU KNOW OF IF YOU GO THERE YOU

01:06:50.973 --> 01:06:52.174
THINK IT'S REALLY LIKE A LITTLE

01:06:52.241 --> 01:06:53.976
HOME TOWN -- IN A LOT OF

01:06:54.043 --> 01:06:55.511
PEOPLE'S MINDS AND SO MUCH MANY

01:06:55.578 --> 01:06:56.712
OF THE POLICIES AND THINGS HAVE

01:06:56.779 --> 01:06:58.481
BEEN THERE HAVE REALLY BEEN VERY

01:06:58.547 --> 01:07:00.483
PAROCHIAL IN TERMS OF OF HOW WE

01:07:00.549 --> 01:07:02.251
OPERATE IT'S IT IS A DIFFERENT

01:07:02.318 --> 01:07:03.219
PLACE AND SELL.

01:07:03.285 --> 01:07:04.353
OF THEIR A LOT OF THINGS THAT

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:05.988
ARE HAPPENING NOW IN THE CITY TO

01:07:06.055 --> 01:07:07.189
HARMONIZE.

01:07:07.256 --> 01:07:09.625
WHAT DO PRACTICES EXIST BETWEEN

01:07:09.692 --> 01:07:11.694
VARIOUS AREAS AND AND SO MANY

01:07:11.761 --> 01:07:12.595
THERE'S SEVERAL DIFFERENT OF

01:07:12.661 --> 01:07:14.230
COMMUNICABLE AS BOARDS IN SAN

01:07:14.296 --> 01:07:16.298
DIEGO -- AS WELL AS SCHOOL

01:07:16.365 --> 01:07:18.467
BOARDS AND SO -- THERE'S A LOT

01:07:18.534 --> 01:07:20.035
OF EFFORTS TO TRY TO STANDARDIZE

01:07:20.102 --> 01:07:21.537
THE EXPECTATIONS THAT ARE THERE

01:07:21.604 --> 01:07:23.639
BECAUSE PEOPLE LIVE IN ONE AREA

01:07:23.706 --> 01:07:25.107
BUT WORK SOMEWHERE ELSE AND SO

01:07:25.174 --> 01:07:26.342
THE ASSUMPTION IS.

01:07:26.409 --> 01:07:27.943
THAT IT'S PRETTY MUCH ONE BUT IS

01:07:28.010 --> 01:07:30.312
IT REALLY IS NOT SO I WOULD

01:07:30.379 --> 01:07:31.213
SUPPORT THIS I THINK IT'S IT'S

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:33.616
IT'S MODEST IN TERMS OF THAT

01:07:33.682 --> 01:07:35.251
IT'S A LARGE AREA SO BEING ABLE

01:07:35.317 --> 01:07:36.719
TO COLLECT HUNDRED SIGNATURES.

01:07:36.786 --> 01:07:38.120
YOU CAN DO THAT IN A LESS THAN A

01:07:38.187 --> 01:07:39.889
WEEK IN IN FRONT OF A MALL OR

01:07:39.955 --> 01:07:41.424
FOR JUST KNOCK ON PEOPLE'S DOORS

01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:42.358
AND WE'D HAVE BEEN FAIRLY

01:07:42.425 --> 01:07:43.592
LIBERAL ABOUT FOLKS.

01:07:43.659 --> 01:07:46.162
ACTUALLY NOT MEETING THE TARGET --

01:07:46.228 --> 01:07:47.963
IF THEY GO TO COURT WHICH IS OUT

01:07:48.030 --> 01:07:49.198
NOW THE WHOLE WEIRD STORY ITSELF

01:07:49.265 --> 01:07:50.566
THAT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME IN SAN

01:07:50.633 --> 01:07:53.035
DIEGO -- WHERE YOU ONLY HAVE

01:07:53.102 --> 01:07:53.969
NINETY EIGHT SIGNATURES EVEN

01:07:54.036 --> 01:07:55.204
THOUGH HE TOOK A HUNDRED AND

01:07:55.271 --> 01:07:56.672
FIVE AND SO YOU STILL IN UP ON

01:07:56.739 --> 01:07:57.306
THE BALLOT?

01:07:57.373 --> 01:07:59.542
BUT NONE THE LESS I I SUPPORT

01:07:59.608 --> 01:08:00.609
THIS AND I THANK YOU FOR

01:08:00.676 --> 01:08:02.378
BRINGING FORTH.

01:08:02.445 --> 01:08:02.945
THANK YOU DOCTOR OUR MISTER

01:08:03.012 --> 01:08:03.579
CALDERON.

01:08:03.646 --> 01:08:04.680
THIS GUY THAT THE BILL MAKES

01:08:04.747 --> 01:08:06.148
SENSE I GET IT I APPRECIATE WHAT

01:08:06.215 --> 01:08:07.750
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE -- I

01:08:07.817 --> 01:08:09.852
MEAN I THINK THE HUNDRED IS A

01:08:09.919 --> 01:08:11.120
LITTLE BIT HIGH I THINK IF IT'S

01:08:11.187 --> 01:08:11.787
GOOD FOR IS GOOD FOR US TO COULD

01:08:11.854 --> 01:08:12.822
BE GOOD FOR THEM.

01:08:12.888 --> 01:08:14.557
I KNOW IT'S NOT THAT DIFFICULT

01:08:14.623 --> 01:08:16.225
BUT STILL KIND OF A PAIN IN THE

01:08:16.292 --> 01:08:17.493
**** TO GET THE FORTY SIGNATURES

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:24.867
IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT

01:08:24.934 --> 01:08:25.835
IT SHOULD BE THERE IT JUST.

01:08:25.901 --> 01:08:26.469
YOU KNOW WE CAN BE A LITTLE BIT

01:08:26.535 --> 01:08:27.203
MORE REASONABLE ON THE THE

01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:27.837
NUMBER OF SIGNATURES THAT WE'RE

01:08:27.903 --> 01:08:28.337
ASKING FOR NOT A LOT OF

01:08:28.404 --> 01:08:28.938
DIFFERENT REASONS WHY THIS IS

01:08:29.004 --> 01:08:29.505
IMPORTANT BECAUSE A LOT OF

01:08:29.572 --> 01:08:30.139
DIFFERENT REASONS THAT SOMEBODY

01:08:30.206 --> 01:08:30.806
MAY PUT THEIR NAME ON THE BALLOT.

01:08:30.873 --> 01:08:31.373
IN ALTHOUGH THERE ARE LAWS

01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:31.941
PROTECTING AGAINST THIS IT

01:08:32.007 --> 01:08:32.575
DOESN'T STILL PRECLUDE PEOPLE

01:08:32.641 --> 01:08:33.142
FROM PUTTING THE NAME ON A

01:08:33.209 --> 01:08:34.210
BALLOT BECAUSE THEY WANT TO

01:08:34.276 --> 01:08:35.845
UNDER CUT ANOTHER PERSON SO THAT

01:08:35.911 --> 01:08:37.079
THEY DON'T WIN AND SO THERE'S A

01:08:37.146 --> 01:08:38.080
LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS.

01:08:38.147 --> 01:08:39.582
WHY PEOPLE PUT THEIR NAMES ON

01:08:39.648 --> 01:08:40.449
THE BALLOT BUT I THINK IT'S

01:08:40.516 --> 01:08:42.485
IMPORTANT THAT ANYBODY WHO WANTS

01:08:42.551 --> 01:08:43.619
TO RUN FOR OFFICE WE WANT TO

01:08:43.686 --> 01:08:44.987
ENCOURAGE THEM TO RUN FOR OFFICE

01:08:45.054 --> 01:08:45.821
BUT THEY ALSO HAVE TO HAVE A

01:08:45.888 --> 01:08:46.222
STAKE?

01:08:46.288 --> 01:08:47.690
AND THERE HAS TO BE AT LEAST

01:08:47.756 --> 01:08:48.591
SOME LEVEL OF SUPPORT WITHIN THE

01:08:48.657 --> 01:08:49.758
COMMUNITY SO THAT THEY'RE NOT

01:08:49.825 --> 01:08:50.926
JUST PUTTING.

01:08:50.993 --> 01:08:51.727
THEY'RE NOT JUST PUTTING THE

01:08:51.794 --> 01:08:52.561
NAME ON THE BALLOT FOR THE SAKE

01:08:52.628 --> 01:08:53.529
OF PUTTING THEM IN NAME ON THE

01:08:53.596 --> 01:08:55.164
BALLOT FOR WHATEVER REASONS --

01:08:55.231 --> 01:08:56.832
AS OUR MOTIVATING THEM IT'S

01:08:56.899 --> 01:08:57.933
THERE THERE'S INVESTMENT THERE

01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.368
AND OUR PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY

01:08:59.435 --> 01:09:00.169
THAT THEY'RE TALKING TO AND

01:09:00.236 --> 01:09:01.237
THEY'RE ACTUALLY.

01:09:01.303 --> 01:09:01.871
DOING THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:09:01.937 --> 01:09:03.205
DONE FOR TO RUN A LEGITIMATE

01:09:03.272 --> 01:09:04.940
CAMPAIGN TO BE A LEGITIMATE --

01:09:05.007 --> 01:09:08.978
PUBLIC OFFICIAL IF IN FACT THEY

01:09:09.044 --> 01:09:09.178
DO IT.

01:09:09.245 --> 01:09:10.446
THANK YOU.

01:09:10.513 --> 01:09:11.580
THE MISTER CALDERON DID ALL THIS

01:09:11.647 --> 01:09:12.214
IS MADE JUST ONE LAST THING AND

01:09:12.281 --> 01:09:13.215
BUT JUST BE QUICK AND ACTUALLY

DO AGREE WITH -- MISTER CALDERON --

01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:15.718
BUT THE IDEA THAT THERE NEEDS TO

01:09:15.784 --> 01:09:17.152
BE SOME LIMIT YOU GOT TO HAVE

01:09:17.219 --> 01:09:18.888
SOME SOME BOMB BAIRD ENTRY IF

01:09:18.954 --> 01:09:19.755
YOU WILL NOT EVERYBODY SHOULD BE

01:09:19.822 --> 01:09:20.723
ABLE TO HAVE.

01:09:20.789 --> 01:09:22.191
OTHER NAME ON ABOUT YOU GOT TO

01:09:22.258 --> 01:09:22.892
SHOW THAT THERE SOME SOME OF THE

01:09:22.958 --> 01:09:24.226
SUPPORT I I DO WONDER THOUGH

01:09:24.293 --> 01:09:25.594
SHOULD THIS BE THE STATE RULE

01:09:25.661 --> 01:09:27.463
THAT APPLIES TO ALL OF THE ALL

01:09:27.530 --> 01:09:28.430
SCHOOL DISTRICTS ALL CALLS

01:09:28.497 --> 01:09:34.203

STATEWIDE LEGISLATION I GUESS

01:09:40.276 --> 01:09:41.377
WOULD BE MAYBE SOMETHING THAT

01:09:41.443 --> 01:09:42.778
THIS COMMITTEE COULD CONSIDER --

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:43.746
SUGGESTING.

01:09:43.812 --> 01:09:44.813

01:17:35.851 --> 01:17:37.386

01:17:52.401 --> 01:17:54.202
LOT OF MEMBERS WALKING THE HALLS

01:17:54.269 --> 01:17:54.903
HERE.

01:17:54.970 --> 01:17:56.405
ARE GIVEN THE TERM LIMITS IN

01:17:56.471 --> 01:17:58.106

JUST DON'T SEE IT YOU KNOW I SEE

01:17:59.341 --> 01:18:00.709
THEM LEAVING TO RUN FOR THE

01:18:00.776 --> 01:18:01.710
OFFICES.

01:18:01.777 --> 01:18:03.412
BUT I CAN PROBABLY THINK OF ONE

01:18:03.478 --> 01:18:05.547
PERSON WHO IT AND WE DO ADDRESS

01:18:05.614 --> 01:18:07.049

TERMS A CERTAIN EXTENT.

01:18:22.097 --> 01:18:24.466

MAYBE BECAUSE AT THAT I HAVE NO

01:18:25.734 --> 01:18:28.370
DESIRE TO BE A LOBBYIST EVER AND

01:18:28.437 --> 01:18:30.305
I DON'T KNOW -- AND SO MAYBE

01:18:30.372 --> 01:18:32.908
THIS IS NOT AN ATTRACTION.

01:18:32.974 --> 01:18:33.942

01:18:36.912 --> 01:18:38.713
WHEELCHAIR AS A LOBBYIST BUT

01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:39.514

01:18:39.581 --> 01:18:40.615
THERE'S SOME OR OR ON CRUTCHES

01:18:40.682 --> 01:18:45.687
OR WHATEVER BUT A WALKER BUT ALL

01:18:45.754 --> 01:18:45.887
OF IT.

01:18:45.954 --> 01:18:46.922

01:18:46.988 --> 01:18:47.589
FIGURE OUT IF THERE'S IF THERE'S

01:18:47.656 --> 01:18:48.990
A PROBLEM YOU KNOW I MEAN.

01:18:49.057 --> 01:18:50.859
I SEE CREATING A RULE BUT I

01:18:50.926 --> 01:18:52.360

JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

THE PROBLEM IS WHEN I LOOK AT

01:20:22.784 --> 01:20:24.152
THE NUMBERS EVEN THE RATIONALE A

01:20:24.219 --> 01:20:25.754

WELL FIRST.

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:47.108
I'M AS A MATTER PRINCIPLE THE

01:20:47.175 --> 01:20:49.110
LEAGUE'S POSITION IS THAT.

01:20:49.177 --> 01:20:50.845
THE LEGISLATURE'S NOT A TRAINING

01:20:50.912 --> 01:20:53.114
GROUND FOR A LUCRATIVE CAREER

01:20:53.181 --> 01:20:54.583
AND THAT'S NOT THE WAY WE WANT

01:20:54.649 --> 01:20:56.918
OUR REPRESENTATIVES TO BE

01:20:56.985 --> 01:20:58.053
THINKING ABOUT IT THEY REPRESENT

01:20:58.119 --> 01:21:00.555
THE INTERESTS OF THE VOTERS.

01:21:00.622 --> 01:21:02.157

THE INTERESTS OF CORPORATIONS

01:21:08.129 --> 01:21:10.465
WHICH IS WHAT THIS KIND OF CHURN

01:21:10.532 --> 01:21:12.167
THIS REVOLVING DOOR.

01:21:12.234 --> 01:21:13.835
OF RESULTS IN.

01:21:13.902 --> 01:21:15.870
I DID COME WITH THE ONE EXAMPLE

01:21:15.937 --> 01:21:17.305
OF AND IT WAS ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:21:17.372 --> 01:21:19.107
CRISTINA GARCIA IS BILL COUPLE

OUT TO REDUCE POLLUTION AND THAT

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:26.381
NARROW.

01:21:26.448 --> 01:21:28.984
DEFEAT THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT

01:21:29.050 --> 01:21:31.152
WAS VERY CLEARLY THE DIRECT

01:21:31.219 --> 01:21:34.889
RESULT OF THE LOBBYING BY FOUR

01:21:34.956 --> 01:21:36.258
FORMER LEGISLATORS.

01:21:36.324 --> 01:21:39.928
WHO WERE HIRED SPECIFICALLY BY?

01:21:39.995 --> 01:21:42.097
OIL COMPANIES AND BLOOM PRESS

01:21:42.163 --> 01:21:45.433
ONE OTHER INDUSTRY. TO DEFEAT

01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:47.535

NARROW.

01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:52.073
NARROW.

01:21:52.140 --> 01:21:53.475
WAY.

01:21:53.541 --> 01:21:54.976
ON THE FLOOR.

01:21:55.043 --> 01:21:57.579
ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA WAS.

01:21:57.646 --> 01:21:58.880
IN.

01:21:58.947 --> 01:22:00.515
TWO BECAUSE SHE COULD NOT

01:22:00.582 --> 01:22:03.018
BELIEVE THAT A BILL THAT WAS

01:22:03.084 --> 01:22:06.187
PITCH TO HELP HER CONSTITUENTS.

01:22:06.254 --> 01:22:08.023
AND AND HELP THE PEOPLE OF

01:22:08.089 --> 01:22:10.125
CALIFORNIA COULD REALLY P.

01:22:10.191 --> 01:22:12.394
DEFEATED BY THE KINDS OF MAC IN

01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:14.296

WITH THE CURRENT LEGISLATORS AND

01:22:19.601 --> 01:22:23.038
AND TURN THE TIDE.

01:22:23.104 --> 01:22:24.673
IT WAS A SURPRISE AND WE SEE

01:22:24.739 --> 01:22:26.274
THOSE KINDS OF SURPRISES IN

01:22:26.341 --> 01:22:29.878
OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES AS WELL.

01:22:29.944 --> 01:22:32.047

WE SEATED OTHER INSTANCE

01:22:34.549 --> 01:22:38.920
INSTANCES BUT IN GENERAL IT IS

01:22:38.987 --> 01:22:39.721
SIMPLY THE WRONG DYNAMIC.

01:22:39.788 --> 01:22:41.156
IN THE TIME THAT I'VE BEEN HERE

01:22:41.222 --> 01:22:42.691

01:22:52.734 --> 01:22:55.070
OTHER TWO RESIGNED AND THEN THEY

01:22:55.136 --> 01:22:56.504

BIG PROBLEM IS AND AND AND AND I

01:23:10.685 --> 01:23:13.154

ALL OF US FIGHT THE MONSTERS

01:23:19.494 --> 01:23:21.229

SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING IN SEARCH

01:23:37.379 --> 01:23:38.980
OF A PROBLEM IN AN ADULT.

01:23:39.047 --> 01:23:41.316

01:24:30.064 --> 01:24:31.533
THE KIND OF KNOWLEDGE AND SKILL

01:24:31.599 --> 01:24:32.801
TO SO ESSENTIAL TO BE AN

01:24:32.867 --> 01:24:34.269
EFFECTIVE LEGISLATOR TAKES

YEARS MAY BE A GOOD TIME FRAME

01:24:49.017 --> 01:24:51.619
OR I'M NOT SURE BUT IT JUST

01:24:51.686 --> 01:24:52.720
SEEMS TO BE.

01:24:52.787 --> 01:24:54.022
A SOMEWHAT EXCESSIVE TO A

01:24:54.088 --> 01:24:55.590

01:26:19.908 --> 01:26:20.608
THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT

01:26:20.675 --> 01:26:22.477
THINGS THAT MOVE US AS ELECTED

SINCE I'VE I'VE BEEN HERE IN THE

01:26:25.213 --> 01:26:26.314

THE SENATE ARE GOOD PEOPLE WE

01:26:32.186 --> 01:26:33.254
HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENCES OF

01:26:33.321 --> 01:26:34.122
OPINION.

01:26:34.188 --> 01:26:36.090
I DON'T KNOW OF ANYBODY THAT GOT

ELECTED OFFICE FOR SOME TIME I

01:26:50.772 --> 01:26:52.440
KNOW PUBLIC POLICY REALLY WELL

01:26:52.507 --> 01:26:53.074

I DON'T KNOW MUCH MORE OTHER

01:26:54.442 --> 01:26:56.110
THAN PUBLIC POLICY I GUESS I

01:26:56.177 --> 01:26:56.778
COULD GO BACK AND BE A FINANCIAL

01:26:56.844 --> 01:26:58.513
ADVISER I'M AT SOME POINT TIME

01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:00.048
BUT I THINK THE CURRENT RULES

01:27:00.114 --> 01:27:00.848
THAT WE HAVE THE HAVING THAT

01:27:00.915 --> 01:27:02.450

TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF SENSE AND I

FIVE YEARS IS IS TOO LONG JUST

01:27:08.856 --> 01:27:09.591

SOME OTHER.

01:27:10.224 --> 01:27:11.693
TIME FRAME I'M NOT SURE IS IS

01:27:11.759 --> 01:27:12.994
IMPORTANT HERE IS THE OTHER

01:27:13.061 --> 01:27:15.129
TRUTH I COULDN'T -- AFTER I WAS

01:27:15.196 --> 01:27:17.599

01:28:14.656 --> 01:28:15.857
DIFFERENT REASONS FOR WHY THEY

01:28:15.923 --> 01:28:17.325
VOTED YES OR NO AND HAD.

01:28:17.392 --> 01:28:19.027
YEAH HENRY PRAYERS REALLY GOOD

01:28:19.093 --> 01:28:21.763
GUY BUT WE DON'T LIKE HIM THAT

01:28:21.829 --> 01:28:23.531
MUCH.

01:28:23.598 --> 01:28:25.066
I MEAN SO -- I MEAN.

01:28:25.133 --> 01:28:26.034
IS LIKE BUT I MEAN THAT'S WHAT

01:28:26.100 --> 01:28:27.201
PEOPLE ARE BRING ENOUGH BUT I

01:28:27.268 --> 01:28:28.670
JUST I I DON'T I DON'T THINK

01:28:28.736 --> 01:28:30.138
THAT THAT IS TRUE AT ALL THAT

01:28:30.204 --> 01:28:32.340
THAT'S WHY THAT BILL DIED OR ANY

01:28:32.407 --> 01:28:35.843
OF THOSE THINGS -- AND SO BUT I

01:28:35.910 --> 01:28:37.445
I DO THINK THAT THERE'S A

01:28:37.512 --> 01:28:38.413
THERE'S A LEGITIMATE.

01:28:38.479 --> 01:28:39.847
YOU KNOW ONE YEAR TURNAROUND YOU

01:28:39.914 --> 01:28:41.282
RESIGN AND WHEN YOUR TURN AROUND

01:28:41.349 --> 01:28:41.983
I MEAN.

01:28:42.050 --> 01:28:42.917
THERE'S SOMETHING THERE THAT

01:28:42.984 --> 01:28:44.318
MAYBE IT DOES NEED TO BE

01:28:44.385 --> 01:28:45.887
EXTENDED SO IT SOUNDS LIKE THE

01:28:45.953 --> 01:28:47.088
ASSEMBLY MEMBERS WANTED TO WORK

01:28:47.155 --> 01:28:48.890
ON THAT AND FIND WHAT IS THAT

01:28:48.956 --> 01:28:50.958
RIGHT TIMELINE I THINK THAT'S

01:28:51.025 --> 01:28:52.226
SOMETHING WE CAN ALL SUPPORT --

01:28:52.293 --> 01:28:53.928
BECAUSE THE PUBLIC PERCEPTION IS

01:28:53.995 --> 01:28:56.097
IMPORTANT -- AND ENSURING THAT

01:28:56.164 --> 01:28:58.099
THERE IS SOME SEPARATION BEFORE

01:28:58.166 --> 01:28:59.333
SOMEONE'S BACK LOBBY IN THIS

01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:02.170
AGAIN SO.

01:29:02.236 --> 01:29:03.237
THE YOU MISTER CALDERON.

01:29:03.304 --> 01:29:04.639
Q. I APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION

01:29:04.706 --> 01:29:05.440
OF REACH OUT TO YOUR OFFICE

01:29:05.506 --> 01:29:06.674
ALREADY HAD TO LET YOU KNOW MY

01:29:06.741 --> 01:29:08.576
POSITION ON THIS BILL -- I THINK

01:29:08.643 --> 01:29:09.510
A COUPLE THINGS NEED TO BE

01:29:09.577 --> 01:29:11.145
CLARIFIED IT IS IN ONE YEAR

01:29:11.212 --> 01:29:12.413
AFTER YOU RESIGNED.

01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:13.281
THE CURRENT LAW AND I DON'T

01:29:13.347 --> 01:29:14.682
THINK THAT BASED ON THE THE LAW

01:29:14.749 --> 01:29:15.817
THAT HAS BEEN PASSAGE.

01:29:15.883 --> 01:29:17.085
THERE REALLY ISN'T A LOT OF

01:29:17.151 --> 01:29:18.453
INFORMATION OUT THERE BUT IT'S

01:29:18.519 --> 01:29:20.655
SAY I TERM OUT WILL OKAY IT'S A

01:29:20.722 --> 01:29:22.123
YEAR AFTER I TURNED OUT THAT I

01:29:22.190 --> 01:29:23.424
CAN GO AND LOBBY IF THAT'S WHAT

01:29:23.491 --> 01:29:24.992
I WANT TO DO BUT IF I RESIGNED

01:29:25.059 --> 01:29:26.394
EARLY SAY I RESIGNED TODAY.

01:29:26.461 --> 01:29:28.262
IS IN IN NEXT APRIL THAT I CAN

01:29:28.329 --> 01:29:29.864
BECOME A LOBBYIST NO IT'S

01:29:29.931 --> 01:29:32.433
DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE

01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:33.234
THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO BECOME A

01:29:33.301 --> 01:29:35.403
LOBBYIST BECAUSE IT STARTS AFTER

01:29:35.470 --> 01:29:36.003
THE TERM THAT I RESIGNED FROM

01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:36.537
ENDS.

01:29:36.604 --> 01:29:38.339

01:29:38.406 --> 01:29:39.907

01:29:39.974 --> 01:29:40.541
INDIVIDUAL THAT'S BEEN TALKED

01:29:40.608 --> 01:29:43.144
ABOUT -- FROM THE OIL INDUSTRY

01:29:43.211 --> 01:29:45.880
THEY'RE NOT LOBBYIST AND THEY

01:29:45.947 --> 01:29:46.881
NEVER HAVE BEEN LOBBYIST.

OUR AND THEIR NOT LOBBYING THE

01:29:48.483 --> 01:29:49.717
LEGISLATURE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT

01:29:49.784 --> 01:29:51.385
REGISTERED LOBBYISTS ARE SO IT'S

01:29:51.452 --> 01:29:52.653
AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION TO MAKE

01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:53.688
AS WELL AS THAT.

01:29:53.755 --> 01:29:54.922

THAT ANYTHING I DO RIGHT NOW IS

01:30:26.721 --> 01:30:28.489
PREDICATED UPON WHAT MY LIFE IS

01:30:28.556 --> 01:30:28.956

HAVE CONTRIBUTED MIKE TO MY

01:30:40.301 --> 01:30:41.803

MEASURES I JUST THINK IT'S IT'S

01:30:55.383 --> 01:30:56.984
KIND OF AN EASY THING TO DO.

01:30:57.051 --> 01:30:58.119
IT GETS A LOT OF PRESS THE LET

01:30:58.186 --> 01:30:59.220
THE PRESS LED TO TALK ABOUT

CURRENT LAWS ARE ARE ARE

01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:07.628

01:31:13.401 --> 01:31:15.236
INSUFFICIENT OR NOT SO BECAUSE

01:31:15.303 --> 01:31:16.604
THAT RIGHT -- REASON I WON'T BE

01:33:53.761 --> 01:33:55.696
IN THIS CAPACITY SHOULD THEY NOT

01:33:55.763 --> 01:33:57.498
ADVOCATE OF FOR MORE THAN A

01:33:57.565 --> 01:33:58.833
THIRD OF THEIR TIME.

01:33:58.899 --> 01:34:00.568
SO I THINK WHEN WE TALKING ABOUT

01:34:00.634 --> 01:34:01.702
AS THE AUTHOR STATES IN A

01:34:01.769 --> 01:34:03.704
STATEMENT ABOUT THAT OF THE ON

01:34:03.771 --> 01:34:05.539
INTO INFLUENCE PERHAPS THEN WE

01:34:05.606 --> 01:34:06.173
MIGHT BE ABLE TO HAVE

01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:08.009
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE TYPE OF

01:34:08.075 --> 01:34:09.844
COMPENSATION THAT WE REQUIRED SO

01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:10.211
WE CAN.

01:34:10.277 --> 01:34:12.780
PREVENT AS MUCH OF THE ONION TO

01:34:12.847 --> 01:34:15.016
INFLUENCE OR THE NOTION THAT IT

01:34:15.082 --> 01:34:16.584
AN INDIVIDUAL A LEGISLATIVE WE

01:34:16.650 --> 01:34:19.020
TRY TO SEEK HIGHER COMPENSATION

01:34:19.086 --> 01:34:20.788
IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR PERHAPS WE

01:34:20.855 --> 01:34:22.156
SHOULD COMPENSATE THEM WELL SO

01:34:22.223 --> 01:34:23.457
THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

01:34:23.524 --> 01:34:25.159
AND LEAVE THEIR FAMILIES AND NOT

01:34:25.226 --> 01:34:26.994
BE THE BREAD WINNER AT HOME SO I

01:34:27.061 --> 01:34:28.796
THINK THAT'S THE NOTION THAT

01:34:28.863 --> 01:34:30.264
WHICH WE WERE BUT TIME AND TAKE

01:34:30.331 --> 01:34:32.266
A LOOK AT AND AGAIN IT'S THE TO

01:34:32.333 --> 01:34:32.900
THE AUTHOR WHEN YOU SAID IT'S

ABOUT THE TO THE TIME FRAME OF

01:34:35.436 --> 01:34:35.803
THE YEARS.

01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:37.538
MY FIRM FOR ME THIS IS NOT ABOUT

01:34:37.605 --> 01:34:39.473
THE NOTION OF JUST A BLANKET BAN

01:34:39.540 --> 01:34:40.975
I THINK WE'RE IF WE'RE REALLY

01:34:41.042 --> 01:34:41.742
TRYING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE AT

01:34:41.809 --> 01:34:42.843
HAND.

01:34:42.910 --> 01:34:43.978
IT IS TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION

01:34:44.045 --> 01:34:45.746
ABOUT HOW WE CAN PROTECT THE THE

01:34:45.813 --> 01:34:51.318
PUBLIC INTEREST IN TERMS OF

01:34:51.385 --> 01:34:53.587

WELL I'LL JUST RESPOND BRIEFLY

01:34:57.425 --> 01:34:58.259
IN SAYING THAT I DON'T THINK

01:34:58.325 --> 01:34:59.193
ANYONE SITTING AT THIS TABLE

01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:01.729
SUGGESTED THAT THOSE WHO GO INTO

01:35:01.796 --> 01:35:04.098
LOBBYING ARE ARE ARE EVIL --

01:35:04.165 --> 01:35:06.567
THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT IT'S IT'S

01:35:06.634 --> 01:35:07.635
I'M A PURPOSE.

01:35:07.701 --> 01:35:08.903
FOR IT'S A PROFESSION THAT MANY

01:35:08.969 --> 01:35:10.571
CHOOSE AND I'M NOT TRYING TO

01:35:10.638 --> 01:35:12.039
PREVENT ANYONE FROM GOING INTO

01:35:12.106 --> 01:35:13.707
THAT LINE OF WORK I JUST THINK

01:35:13.774 --> 01:35:14.708
THAT THE TIME FRAME OF THE

01:35:14.775 --> 01:35:16.343
COOLING OFF PERIOD -- IS

01:35:16.410 --> 01:35:17.645
APPROPRIATE I THINK EVERYONE

01:35:17.711 --> 01:35:19.013
OBVIOUSLY HAS A RIGHT TO GO MAKE

01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:20.414
A LIVING FOR THEIR FAMILY IN

01:35:20.481 --> 01:35:21.682
WHATEVER WAY THEY CHOOSE.

01:35:21.749 --> 01:35:23.084
BUT I DO THINK IT'S A PERFECT

01:35:23.150 --> 01:35:24.518
HAVE SOME SORT OF BUFFER IN

01:35:24.585 --> 01:35:25.319
BETWEEN THE TIME THEY WERE

01:35:25.386 --> 01:35:26.654

01:46:40.694 --> 01:46:41.962

NUMBER OF INDEPENDENTS WHO DON'T

01:46:56.076 --> 01:46:56.676
REALIZE.

01:46:56.743 --> 01:46:58.278
THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO RE

PARTICIPATE IN THE REDUCING

01:57:19.232 --> 01:57:20.199

01:57:20.266 --> 01:57:21.701
YOU MAY NOT EVEN BE AWARE THAT

01:57:21.768 --> 01:57:23.436
IT IS OCCURRING.

01:57:23.503 --> 01:57:24.871
TAKEN TOGETHER THIS PROVIDES A

01:57:24.937 --> 01:57:26.472
LITTLE ONLY A LITTLE SAFETYNET

01:57:26.539 --> 01:57:30.076
AGAINST EXTREME GERRYMANDERING

01:57:30.143 --> 01:57:31.778

01:58:45.051 --> 01:58:45.618
SO THE KEEPING NEIGHBORHOODS AND

THINK.

02:10:31.590 --> 02:10:33.325
OFTENTIMES THERE'S A PERSPECTIVE

02:10:33.392 --> 02:10:34.793
THAT EVERYTHING IS GOING WELL.

02:10:34.860 --> 02:10:37.496

02:10:38.997 --> 02:10:40.799
GROUPS THAT ARE SMALLER DO YOU

02:10:40.866 --> 02:10:41.567
REALIZE THAT EVERYBODY'S NOT

02:10:41.633 --> 02:10:43.635
HAPPY THOSE WHO GENERALLY ON THE

02:10:43.702 --> 02:10:44.803
BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS AND RUN

02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:46.505
AND THINGS ARE VERY HAPPY.

02:10:46.572 --> 02:10:48.073
WITH WHAT HAPPENS THEY THINK

02:10:48.140 --> 02:10:49.508
IT'S VERY FAIR VERY HONEST THEY

02:10:49.575 --> 02:10:51.476
EITHER IN SAN DIEGO THEY HAD WE

02:10:51.543 --> 02:10:53.345
HAD JUDGES WHO WOULD BASICALLY

02:10:53.412 --> 02:10:54.146
DOING THIS.

02:10:54.213 --> 02:10:56.515
AND AND IT ENDED YOU KNOW WHEN

02:10:56.582 --> 02:10:57.749
YOU GET DOWN TO THE LEVEL FOLKS

02:10:57.816 --> 02:10:59.017
THEY WERE SAYING YOU KNOW OUR

02:10:59.084 --> 02:11:00.519
COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN DIVIDED WE

02:11:00.586 --> 02:11:02.287
HAVEN'T HAD BEEN HURT WE DON'T

02:11:02.354 --> 02:11:03.855
KNOW YOU KNOW ON AND ON AND ON

02:11:03.922 --> 02:11:04.556
AND SO.

02:11:04.623 --> 02:11:06.792
IF YOU'RE NOT A PART OF IT THEN

02:11:06.858 --> 02:11:08.527
YOU DON'T REALIZE YOU KNOW THAT

02:11:08.594 --> 02:11:09.428
THAT THAT THERE THERE'S THIS

02:11:09.494 --> 02:11:11.296
THIS THING GOING ON AND MANY OF

02:11:11.363 --> 02:11:13.332
OUR SPECIAL DISTRICTS PARTICULAR

02:11:13.398 --> 02:11:14.566
HOSPITAL DISTRICTS.

02:11:14.633 --> 02:11:16.268
OF OF FOLKS DON'T EVEN KNOW THEY

02:11:16.335 --> 02:11:18.804
EXIST -- AT LEAST I DISCOVERED

02:11:18.870 --> 02:11:20.439
IN IN SAN DIEGO THAT SOME OF

02:11:20.505 --> 02:11:21.640
THEM BOB AND YET THEY'RE MAKING

02:11:21.707 --> 02:11:23.742
MAJOR DECISIONS ABOUT HEALTHCARE

02:11:23.809 --> 02:11:25.143
IN COMMUNITIES AND WHO'S BEING

02:11:25.210 --> 02:11:26.612
SERVED WHO'S NOT BEING SIR.

02:11:26.678 --> 02:11:28.146
SO THE HEALTHCARE DISTRICT IN

02:11:28.213 --> 02:11:29.514
SAN DIEGO NOW PEOPLE GOES MY

02:11:29.581 --> 02:11:30.949
PARTICULARLY THERE ARE A LOT OF

02:11:31.016 --> 02:11:32.251
PEOPLE RAISING ISSUES THAT ARE

02:11:32.317 --> 02:11:33.919
COMING FORTH BUT MOST COMMUNITY

02:11:33.986 --> 02:11:35.754
FOLKS HAVE NO IDEA BECAUSE OF

02:11:35.821 --> 02:11:36.688
THE WAY THE DISTRICTS THE THE

02:11:36.755 --> 02:11:37.322
STRUCTURE.

02:11:37.389 --> 02:11:39.758
OR HOW THEY DO THE BUSINESS THEY

02:11:39.825 --> 02:11:40.359
DO THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW THEY

02:11:40.425 --> 02:11:42.327
EXIST SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT --

02:11:42.394 --> 02:11:45.230
THAT -- THAT WE DO OPEN UP THIS

02:11:45.297 --> 02:11:47.733
WHOLE AREA BECAUSE THERE ARE

02:11:47.799 --> 02:11:48.634
MANY MANY COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

02:11:48.700 --> 02:11:50.469
OF A SPLIT AND I HAVE SOME THAT

02:11:50.535 --> 02:11:52.471
A SPLIT AND DIVIDED IN VARIOUS

02:11:52.537 --> 02:11:52.971
WAYS.

02:11:53.038 --> 02:11:54.573
AND IT DOES MAKE IT DIFFICULT

02:11:54.640 --> 02:11:56.475
FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES TO EVEN

02:11:56.541 --> 02:11:57.876
JUST TO ACCESS THEIR ELECTED

02:11:57.943 --> 02:11:59.311
OFFICIALS SOMETIMES PEOPLE SAY

02:11:59.378 --> 02:12:01.046
WELL YOU'RE VERY FORTUNATE TO

02:12:01.113 --> 02:12:03.215
HAVE THREE ELECTED OFFICIAL WANT

02:12:03.282 --> 02:12:03.782
TO TALK TO THREE ELECTED.

02:12:03.849 --> 02:12:06.218
ME YEAH IF YOU HAVE NOTHING ELSE

02:12:06.285 --> 02:12:07.352
TO DO BUT IF YOU KNOW.

02:12:07.419 --> 02:12:09.154
THE WHOLE IDEA OF IT THEY HAD

02:12:09.221 --> 02:12:10.455
YOUR YOUR YOUR POWER HAS BEEN

02:12:10.522 --> 02:12:12.791
DIVIDED UP SO YOU THINK YOU HAVE

02:12:12.858 --> 02:12:13.592
THREE REPRESENT IS WHAT YOU

02:12:13.659 --> 02:12:15.060
REALLY DON'T BECAUSE OF THE

02:12:15.127 --> 02:12:16.795
WEIGHT OF THE OF OF THE THE

02:12:16.862 --> 02:12:18.030
COLLECTIVE IS NOT THERE AND SO

02:12:18.096 --> 02:12:19.364
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT.

02:12:19.431 --> 02:12:20.632
HOW YOU DO IT AND I KNOW IT'S

02:12:20.699 --> 02:12:22.334
DIFFICULT AND IS EXPENSIVE AND

02:12:22.401 --> 02:12:24.036
DEMOCRACY ALWAYS TAKES MORE TIME

02:12:24.102 --> 02:12:25.103
THAT WE WANT TO GIVE?

02:12:25.170 --> 02:12:26.438
UP BUT I THINK THERE'S SOME

02:12:26.505 --> 02:12:27.973
VALUE AND IT'S OUR I REALLY

02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:29.207
RESPECT YOUR COMMENTS BECAUSE I

02:12:29.274 --> 02:12:34.846
KNOW IT'S HARD.

02:12:34.913 --> 02:12:35.480
WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO MANAGE ALL

02:12:35.547 --> 02:12:36.715
THESE THINGS IN TRYING TO GET

02:12:36.782 --> 02:12:37.316
THINGS GOING AT IT IT REQUIRES

02:12:37.382 --> 02:12:38.350
MORE RESOURCES AND WHAT TIME BUT

02:12:38.417 --> 02:12:39.284
AT THE SAME TIME THOSE THE TO

02:12:39.351 --> 02:12:40.485
GET PEOPLE INVOLVED AND ENGAGED --

02:12:40.552 --> 02:12:41.920
IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT SO THAT

02:12:41.987 --> 02:12:43.989
UP THOSE ENTITIES HAVE A LOT

02:12:44.056 --> 02:12:47.125
MORE -- OF PARTICIPATION I THINK

02:12:47.192 --> 02:12:48.493
BUT THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN THAT

02:12:48.560 --> 02:12:49.995
SENSE SO I EXT.

SECOND HAVE A MOTION AND A

02:12:56.234 --> 02:12:57.769
SECOND.

02:12:57.836 --> 02:12:58.837
ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR

02:12:58.904 --> 02:13:00.739
COMMENTS.

02:13:04.743 --> 02:13:06.411
OPPOSITION AND WE WILLCONTINUE

02:13:06.478 --> 02:13:07.012
TO WORK WITH THEM TO TRY TO

02:13:07.079 --> 02:13:07.979
STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE HERE

02:13:08.046 --> 02:13:09.548
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO IMPOSE ANY

02:13:09.614 --> 02:13:10.549
UNNECESSARY.

02:13:10.615 --> 02:13:12.050
WORK OR BURDEN WHAT EVERYTHING

02:13:12.117 --> 02:13:13.819
THAT WE ASK OUR LOCAL DISTRICTS

02:13:13.885 --> 02:13:15.387
AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO DO IN

02:13:15.454 --> 02:13:17.222
THIS REGARD TO HAVE VALUE.

02:13:17.289 --> 02:13:17.889
AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO

02:13:17.956 --> 02:13:19.958
BE EFFICIENT. FOR EXAMPLE

02:13:20.025 --> 02:13:21.226
ALLOWING THE HEARINGS TO BE

02:13:21.293 --> 02:13:22.260
CONSOLIDATED WITH ALREADY

02:13:22.327 --> 02:13:23.662
SCHEDULED MEETINGS SO THAT YOU

02:13:23.729 --> 02:13:24.696
DON'T HAVE A SEPARATE MEETING

02:13:24.763 --> 02:13:25.597
BUT YOU CAN JUST INCORPORATED AS

02:13:25.664 --> 02:13:27.165
AN AGENDA ITEM AT A TIME CERTAIN

02:13:27.232 --> 02:13:27.899
DURING.

02:13:27.966 --> 02:13:29.167
AN EXISTING MEETING WE THINK

02:13:29.234 --> 02:13:29.735
THAT'S PRACTICAL THAT THAT'S

02:13:29.801 --> 02:13:31.903
HELPFUL -- I ALSO DON'T THINK

02:13:31.970 --> 02:13:33.205
IT'S NECESSARY OR PRODUCTIVE TO

02:13:33.271 --> 02:13:35.407
GET IN INTO INTENTIONS OF OF

02:13:35.474 --> 02:13:36.641
WHAT ANY CITY COUNCIL OR

02:13:36.708 --> 02:13:38.510
JURISDICTION HAS HAS.

02:13:38.577 --> 02:13:39.978
INTEND TO DO OR NOT DO.

02:13:40.045 --> 02:13:41.012
YOU KNOW I'LL ALWAYS HAVE GOOD

02:13:41.079 --> 02:13:42.381
INTENTIONS BUT I ALSO NEED TO

02:13:42.447 --> 02:13:43.181
LOOK AT THE OUTCOMES AND THE

02:13:43.248 --> 02:13:44.916
OUTCOMES ARE ARE ARE NOT

02:13:44.983 --> 02:13:45.917
ACCEPTABLE WE SAW THE MARTINEZ

MAP.

02:13:46.518 --> 02:13:48.253
OF WE HAVE BEST PRACTICES THAT

02:13:48.320 --> 02:13:49.688
WE LEARNED BOB AT THE STATE

02:13:49.755 --> 02:13:51.223
LEVEL SHOULD BE AND COULD BE

02:13:51.289 --> 02:13:52.791
APPLIED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO

02:13:52.858 --> 02:13:54.559
CREATE -- A FAIR DEMOCRATIC

02:13:54.626 --> 02:13:56.027
PROCESS SO.

02:13:56.094 --> 02:13:57.162
THE EASY WAY THAT ALWAYS THE

02:13:57.229 --> 02:13:58.130
FAIREST OF THE JUST TO THE BEST

02:13:58.196 --> 02:14:00.165
WAY -- THIS WILL CREATE SOME

02:14:00.232 --> 02:14:02.200
BURDENS BUT WE WE WHAT DO ARE

02:14:02.267 --> 02:14:03.935

TO BE DONE TO MODERNIZE THE

02:14:15.514 --> 02:14:15.947
RULES THAT GOVERN LOCAL

WAITING IN LINE AND TOLL OF IN

02:20:30.388 --> 02:20:32.290

DEDICATION THAT STUDENTS HAD IN

02:20:35.226 --> 02:20:36.094
EXERCISING THIS RIGHT.

02:20:36.161 --> 02:20:37.729
IN ESSENCE IT WAS CLEARLY NEEDED

02:20:37.796 --> 02:20:40.165
AND IT WAS USED EXTENSIVELY.

02:20:40.231 --> 02:20:41.499
HAVING THE VOTE CENTER ALSO

02:20:41.566 --> 02:20:43.334

THE CENTER AND THAT REALLY

02:20:49.674 --> 02:20:51.075
CREATED A CULTURE OF COMMUNITY

02:20:51.142 --> 02:20:52.644
OF CIVIC ENGAGEMENT.

02:20:52.710 --> 02:20:54.379

02:20:58.082 --> 02:20:58.650
ISSUE.

02:20:58.716 --> 02:21:00.385
AND THE IMPACT WAS ALMOST

02:21:00.451 --> 02:21:04.189
IMMEASURABLE -- EXCEPT IT IS AND

02:21:04.255 --> 02:21:05.690

ESSENTIAL INISH INSURING

02:21:34.085 --> 02:21:35.553
STRONGER VOTER TURNOUT AMONG

02:21:35.620 --> 02:21:36.955
COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS AS

02:21:37.021 --> 02:21:37.555
WELL AS COLLEGE STUDENTS IN

02:21:37.622 --> 02:21:38.923
GENERAL.

02:21:38.990 --> 02:21:39.424
AND THE STRENGTH IN OUR

02:21:39.490 --> 02:21:40.758
DEMOCRACY AS A WHOLE YOUNG

02:21:40.825 --> 02:21:42.160
PEOPLE CALIFORNIA VOTE AT

02:21:42.227 --> 02:21:43.862
ALARMINGLY LOW RATES.

02:21:43.928 --> 02:21:45.597
I BELIEVE ON CAMPUS VOTE CENTERS

02:21:45.663 --> 02:21:46.197
WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOUNG

02:21:46.264 --> 02:21:47.265
PEOPLE TO VOTE.

02:21:47.332 --> 02:21:50.168
AND WILL ELIMINATE ANY MORE

02:21:50.235 --> 02:21:50.802
BARRIERS THAT PREVENT THEM FROM

02:21:50.869 --> 02:21:51.302
VOTING.

02:21:51.369 --> 02:21:51.936
COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE SPECIALLY

02:21:52.003 --> 02:21:53.037
IN NEED OF ON CAMPUS VOTE

02:21:53.104 --> 02:21:55.340
CENTERS DUE TO THE DIVERSITY OF

02:21:55.406 --> 02:21:56.941
THEIR STUDENT BODIES.

02:21:57.008 --> 02:21:57.909
THERE ARE TWO POINT THREE

02:21:57.976 --> 02:21:59.143
MILLION STUDENTS ENROLLED IN

02:21:59.210 --> 02:22:00.411
COMMUNITY COLLEGES ACROSS

02:22:00.478 --> 02:22:02.714
CALIFORNIA AND ONE POINT THREE

02:22:02.780 --> 02:22:04.415
MILLION OF THEM ARE UNDER.

02:22:04.482 --> 02:22:05.283
TWENTY FIVE COMMUNITY COLLEGE

02:22:05.350 --> 02:22:07.018
STUDENTS OFTEN WORK FULL TIME

02:22:07.085 --> 02:22:08.353
AND PART TIME JOBS WHILE GOING

02:22:08.419 --> 02:22:09.687
TO SCHOOL AND HAVE TROUBLE

02:22:09.754 --> 02:22:10.822
FINDING TIME TO VOTE ON ELECTION

02:22:10.889 --> 02:22:12.357
DAY.

02:22:12.423 --> 02:22:13.858
MANY MAY HAVE NEVER VOTED BEFORE

02:22:13.925 --> 02:22:14.759
AND HAVE NEVER HAD THE

02:22:14.826 --> 02:22:15.994
OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO THE POLLS

02:22:16.060 --> 02:22:17.896
WITHOUT APPARENT.

02:22:17.962 --> 02:22:18.930
THE ABILITY TO VOTE I VOTE

02:22:18.997 --> 02:22:20.131
CENTERS ON CAMPUS WOULD ALLOW

02:22:20.198 --> 02:22:21.499
STUDENTS TO EASILY VOTE.

02:22:21.566 --> 02:22:22.934
WITHOUT HAVING TO MISS CLASS OR

02:22:23.001 --> 02:22:24.602
CALL OUT OF WORK.

02:22:24.669 --> 02:22:26.504
BUT SENATOR MOWER COST EFFECTIVE

02:22:26.571 --> 02:22:27.538
SAFE AND IT MAKES IT EASIER TO

02:22:27.605 --> 02:22:28.306
VOTE.

02:22:28.373 --> 02:22:29.807
IN THE PAST MID TERM ELECTION I

02:22:29.874 --> 02:22:31.309
SAW HOW BENEFICIAL ON CAMPUS

02:22:31.376 --> 02:22:32.677
VOTE CENTERS CAN BE EVEN FOR ONE

02:22:32.744 --> 02:22:33.945
SINGLE DAY.

02:22:34.012 --> 02:22:35.613
I THOUGHT ABOUT COLLEGE WE HAD A

02:22:35.680 --> 02:22:38.049
POP UP VOTE CENTER THAT ARRIVED

02:22:38.116 --> 02:22:38.650
ON OUR CAMPUS FOR ONE DAY ON

02:22:38.716 --> 02:22:39.651
HALLOWEEN.

02:22:39.717 --> 02:22:40.585
AS YOU COULD IMAGINE YOU'D

02:22:40.652 --> 02:22:42.120
EXPECT STUDENTS NOT TO BE ON

02:22:42.186 --> 02:22:44.222
CAMPUS DURING HALLOWEEN -- BUT

02:22:44.289 --> 02:22:45.990
IT DEDICATED FULL SERVICE VOTE

02:22:46.057 --> 02:22:46.891
CENTERS.

02:22:46.958 --> 02:22:48.359
AND PROVIDE ON CAMPUS FOR FUTURE

02:22:48.426 --> 02:22:49.527
ELECTIONS AND WE HAD A

02:22:49.594 --> 02:22:51.129
SIGNIFICANTLY HIGH VOTER TURNOUT

02:22:51.195 --> 02:22:53.498
ON THAT DAY.

02:22:53.564 --> 02:22:54.899
IN THE STEPS DESPITE IT BEING A

02:22:54.966 --> 02:22:56.367
HOLIDAY OVER THREE HUNDRED

02:22:56.434 --> 02:22:57.869
STUDENTS CAST EARLY BALLOTS THAT

02:22:57.936 --> 02:22:59.938
DAY AND WE CAN EXPECT THAT

02:23:00.004 --> 02:23:01.773
NUMBER TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE

02:23:01.839 --> 02:23:03.574
IF THIS BILL DOES PASS.

02:23:03.641 --> 02:23:04.842
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR

02:23:04.909 --> 02:23:06.010

HAVE A ROLE IN THE POLICY

02:23:08.212 --> 02:23:08.980
DECISIONS.

02:23:09.047 --> 02:23:11.149
THAT SHAPE THEIR LIVES AB FIFTY

02:23:11.215 --> 02:23:12.817
NINE GIVES YOUNG PEOPLE THE

02:23:12.884 --> 02:23:13.718
TOOLS TO MAKE THEIR VOICES HEARD.

THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

02:23:32.637 --> 02:23:33.738
IRVINE.

02:23:33.805 --> 02:23:35.073
AS STUDENT I SAW FIRSTHAND THE

02:23:35.139 --> 02:23:36.641
DIFFICULTIES AND THE IMPORTANCE

02:23:36.708 --> 02:23:38.910
OF VOTING IN COLLEGE CAMPUSES.

02:23:38.977 --> 02:23:39.877
STUDENTS CARE ABOUT THE ISSUES

02:23:39.944 --> 02:23:41.679
AND POLITICS BUBBLE AT A LOWER

02:23:41.746 --> 02:23:43.448
RATE THAN ANY OTHER AGE GROUP I

02:23:43.514 --> 02:23:45.183

THE BALLOT ON AND ON ALL SIDES

02:23:48.219 --> 02:23:49.354
OF THE SPECTRUM.

02:23:49.420 --> 02:23:50.254
THANKS FOR A GREAT REGISTER

02:23:50.321 --> 02:23:51.589
VOTERS YOU SEE I WAS LUCKY

02:23:51.656 --> 02:23:52.557
ENOUGH TO HAVE SEVERAL POLLING

02:23:52.623 --> 02:23:54.258
PLACES ON CAMPUS BUT EVERY

02:23:54.325 --> 02:23:55.827
SINGLE ONE STILL HAD A LINE

02:23:55.893 --> 02:23:57.161
LONGER THAN TWO HOURS.

02:23:57.228 --> 02:23:58.930
I PERSONALLY HAD TO WAIT ABOUT

02:23:58.997 --> 02:23:59.831
TWO AND A HALF HOURS JUST TO

02:23:59.897 --> 02:24:01.599
VOTE BUT THE TIME I GOT TO THE

02:24:01.666 --> 02:24:02.934
FRONT OF THE LINE I HAD MR

02:24:03.001 --> 02:24:06.537
LECTURE IN NOTED TECHS AND THE

02:24:06.604 --> 02:24:08.072
RIGHT TO VOTE. TO ME IT WAS

02:24:08.139 --> 02:24:08.673
WORTH IT BUT I SHOULD NOT HAVE

02:24:08.740 --> 02:24:09.874
TO CHOOSE BETWEEN BOTH.

02:24:09.941 --> 02:24:10.441
MANY OF MY FRIENDS AND HALL

02:24:10.508 --> 02:24:11.075
MATES TOLD ME THAT THEY DIDN'T

02:24:11.142 --> 02:24:11.709
VOTE BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO GET TO

02:24:11.776 --> 02:24:12.744
CLASS.

02:24:12.810 --> 02:24:14.278
THEN HAVE TIME TO WAIT IN LINE

02:24:14.345 --> 02:24:16.681
AND MANY ALSO HAD COMPLICATIONS

02:24:16.748 --> 02:24:17.348
WHAT THEY FOUND THE RIGHT TO THE

02:24:17.415 --> 02:24:18.449
POLLING CENTER.

02:24:18.516 --> 02:24:20.218
IN ADDITION TO LONG LINES THE

02:24:20.284 --> 02:24:21.919
BOWLING CENTERS THAT HAVE

02:24:21.986 --> 02:24:23.287
TRAINED STAFF AND TOLD STUDENTS

02:24:23.354 --> 02:24:23.988
IT WAS NO SAME DAY VOTER

02:24:24.055 --> 02:24:24.856
REGISTRATION.

02:24:24.922 --> 02:24:25.790
MANY OF THE BALLOTS WERE

02:24:25.857 --> 02:24:27.458
PROVISIONAL BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY

02:24:27.525 --> 02:24:28.826
RAN OUT OF ORIGINAL BALLOTS.

02:24:28.893 --> 02:24:29.894
AND MANY STUDENTS FACE

02:24:29.961 --> 02:24:31.362
DISENFRANCHISEMENT BECAUSE OF AN

02:24:31.429 --> 02:24:32.697
UNACCOUNTED ISSUES WITH ALL MY

02:24:32.764 --> 02:24:34.132
REGISTRATION THAT DID NOT ALLOW

02:24:34.198 --> 02:24:35.299
THEM TO CHANGE THE ADDRESS TO

02:24:35.366 --> 02:24:36.367
THE SCHOOLS.

02:24:36.434 --> 02:24:37.668
THERE'S NO DENYING THAT THEY'RE

02:24:37.735 --> 02:24:39.070
HERE THAT THERE'S A HIGH DEMAND

02:24:39.137 --> 02:24:41.339
AND LOW SUPPLY VOTING LOCATIONS

02:24:41.406 --> 02:24:42.540
AND THE ANSWER WOULD BE TO

02:24:42.607 --> 02:24:45.343
PROVIDE VOTING CENTERS AND WHICH

02:24:45.410 --> 02:24:45.877
WOULD A LOT FOR THE EXTRA

02:24:45.943 --> 02:24:46.978
ASSISTANCE.

02:24:47.045 --> 02:24:48.279
AREAS LIKE LONG LINES TO TO THE

02:24:48.346 --> 02:24:49.947
LEAD TO THE DISENFRANCHISEMENT

02:24:50.014 --> 02:24:52.250
OF YOUNGER POPULATIONS WOULD BE

02:24:52.316 --> 02:24:53.484
EVEN WORSE THAN.

02:24:53.551 --> 02:24:54.919
LONG LINES WOULD BE NO LINE AT

02:24:54.986 --> 02:24:56.320
ALL BECAUSE THERE'S NO WHERE TO

02:24:56.387 --> 02:24:57.355
VOTE.

02:24:57.422 --> 02:24:58.856
LIKE MANY OF MY PEERS I DON'T

02:24:58.923 --> 02:25:00.591
HAVE ACCESS TO A CAR OR RELIABLE

02:25:00.658 --> 02:25:02.260
TRANSPORTATION WOULD WOULD WHICH

02:25:02.326 --> 02:25:03.127
WOULD MEAN THAT IF THERE WERE NO

02:25:03.194 --> 02:25:07.865
NEARBY -- LOCATION VOTE I DON'T

02:25:07.932 --> 02:25:10.034
KNOW HOW I WOULD GET THEIR I

02:25:10.101 --> 02:25:10.601
CAME HERE ALL THE WAY FROM

02:25:10.668 --> 02:25:11.836
IRVINE TO ADVOCATE FOR THIS BILL

02:25:11.903 --> 02:25:12.804
WHICH SHOWS THAT I GO TO ANY

02:25:12.870 --> 02:25:13.871
LENGTHS TO VOTE.

02:25:13.938 --> 02:25:15.173
HOWEVER IT THE AVERAGE BUSY

02:25:15.239 --> 02:25:16.340
BECAUSE CITY CANNOT AFFORD TO

02:25:16.407 --> 02:25:19.077
SPEND MUCH TIME AWAY FROM SCHOOL

02:25:19.143 --> 02:25:20.611
TO GET TO A POINT PLACE.

02:25:20.678 --> 02:25:23.081
AS COLLEGE STUDENTS WE NEED AB

02:25:23.147 --> 02:25:23.714

OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE TERM

02:25:24.749 --> 02:25:25.783
FRANCHISE A POPULATION OF

02:25:25.850 --> 02:25:27.552
AGAINST COSTED FRIENDS THAT ARE

02:25:27.618 --> 02:25:28.419
OFTEN FORGOTTEN.

02:38:27.164 --> 02:38:29.600
BEEN SOMEHOW TAKEN AWAY BECAUSE

02:38:29.666 --> 02:38:31.501
THEY'RE THEY'RE IN JAIL AND SO

02:38:31.568 --> 02:38:33.203
WHAT THESE ORGANIZATIONS WE HAVE

02:38:33.270 --> 02:38:34.705
THE ABILITY TO DO IS TO DO VOTER

02:38:34.771 --> 02:38:37.274
EDUCATION. TO LET THEM KNOW YOU

02:38:37.341 --> 02:38:38.876

WHETHER IT'S STUDENTS OR ANY

02:40:51.041 --> 02:40:53.010
GROUP FOR THAT MATTER -- OVER

02:40:53.076 --> 02:40:55.212
OTHER GROUPS YOU KNOW TO ME IS

02:40:55.278 --> 02:40:56.446
KIND OF WHY WE MAKE IN THAT

02:40:56.513 --> 02:40:58.482
SPECIAL CASE FOR A SPECIAL GROUP

02:40:58.548 --> 02:40:59.383
OF PEOPLE.

02:40:59.449 --> 02:41:01.018
MAYBE THEY VOTE FOR ONE PARTY

02:41:01.084 --> 02:41:01.952
OVER THE OTHER MORE THAN THE

02:41:02.019 --> 02:41:03.720
OTHER I DON'T KNOW MAYBE THAT'S

02:41:03.787 --> 02:41:04.821
THE REASON I DON'T KNOW.

ANYWAYS.

02:41:24.041 --> 02:41:25.108
BUT BOTTOM LINE IS I MEAN I

02:41:25.175 --> 02:41:26.109
DON'T KNOW WHY WE NEED TO

02:41:26.176 --> 02:41:27.411
SPECIFICALLY TARGET ANY GROUP

02:41:27.477 --> 02:41:30.647

HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE AND I WAS

02:42:05.982 --> 02:42:07.484
AMAZED AT HOW MANY PEOPLE WALK

02:42:07.551 --> 02:42:09.386
AROUND THIS CAPITAL WHO DID NOT

02:42:09.453 --> 02:42:10.687
KNOW SOMEONE MORE PROBATION

02:42:10.754 --> 02:42:13.256
OFFICERS WHO DIDN'T KNOW THAT --

02:42:13.323 --> 02:42:14.491

PEOPLE TOLD ME WHEN I GOT AND I

02:42:20.664 --> 02:42:21.965

02:42:22.032 --> 02:42:22.999
BECAUSE THEY WERE PROBATION

02:42:23.066 --> 02:42:24.501
OFFICERS AND OTHERS WHO DIDN'T

02:42:24.568 --> 02:42:26.203
UNDERSTAND THE RULES WE DIDN'T

02:42:26.269 --> 02:42:27.137
KNOW THE LAW.

02:42:27.204 --> 02:42:28.705
AND THEN IN ADDITION TO THAT

02:42:28.772 --> 02:42:30.607
WHEN THE WHOLE ISSUE WITH THE

02:42:30.674 --> 02:42:32.275
CURRENT -- SECRETARY STATE CAME

02:42:32.342 --> 02:42:33.577
DOWN THE DECISION WE DID A

02:42:33.643 --> 02:42:35.979
PODCAST AND WE HEARD SO MANY

02:42:36.046 --> 02:42:37.481
PEOPLE WHO TALKED ABOUT THE FACT

02:42:37.547 --> 02:42:39.182
THAT THEY WERE ADVOCATES TRYING

02:42:39.249 --> 02:42:40.817
TO GET INTO JAILS. TO BASICALLY

02:42:40.884 --> 02:42:42.419
REGISTER PEOPLE TO VOTE AND HELP

02:42:42.486 --> 02:42:43.954
THEM UNDERSTAND AND THEY WERE

02:42:44.020 --> 02:42:45.755
BEING BLOCKED BY SHERIFF'S WHO

02:42:45.822 --> 02:42:47.757
DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE LAW NUMBER

02:42:47.824 --> 02:42:48.391
ONE IN WHO DIDN'T REALLY CARE

02:42:48.458 --> 02:42:49.426
SOME OF THEM.

02:42:49.493 --> 02:42:50.760
NOW THERE'S SOME SHERIFFS LIKE

02:42:50.827 --> 02:42:52.629
THE ONE IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY WHO

02:42:52.696 --> 02:42:54.297
GOES OUT OF HIS WAY GORE DOES TO

02:42:54.364 --> 02:42:55.532
MAKE SURE THAT THE MATERIALS

02:42:55.599 --> 02:42:57.367
THERE IS AVAILABLE BUT HE'LL

02:42:57.434 --> 02:42:58.034
TELL YOU EVERYONE DOESN'T DO THE

02:42:58.101 --> 02:42:58.869
SAME THING.

02:42:58.935 --> 02:42:59.936
AND SO AS A RESULT WE HAVE A

02:43:00.003 --> 02:43:01.371
GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:43:01.438 --> 02:43:02.639
INCARCERATED.

02:43:02.706 --> 02:43:04.407
WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE LIMITED

02:43:04.474 --> 02:43:07.177
ACCESS TO TELEPHONES MATERIALS

02:43:07.244 --> 02:43:08.378
ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AND IF

02:43:08.445 --> 02:43:10.147
THAT JAIL DOES NOT PUT UP

02:43:10.213 --> 02:43:11.748
MATERIAL FOR THEM TO REGISTER TO

02:43:11.815 --> 02:43:12.816
VOTE THEY WILL LET HIM GO ONLINE

02:43:12.883 --> 02:43:14.217
AND REGISTER TO VOTE.

02:43:14.284 --> 02:43:15.352
AND ALL THAT OTHER KIND OF STUFF

02:43:15.418 --> 02:43:17.420
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN IN MOST

02:43:17.487 --> 02:43:18.688
FOLKS DON'T KNOW THAT THEY HAVE

02:43:18.755 --> 02:43:19.723
THE RIGHT TO VOTE THAT EVEN

02:43:19.789 --> 02:43:20.557
GROUPS ARE GOING TO PICK UP

02:43:20.624 --> 02:43:22.425
THEIR ABSENTEE BALLOTS -- IF

02:43:22.492 --> 02:43:23.627
THEY GIVEN AFTER THE BALLOT

02:43:23.693 --> 02:43:24.995
BECOMES AN OBSTACLE IN A

02:43:25.061 --> 02:43:25.829
CHALLENGE SO.

02:43:25.896 --> 02:43:27.330
THIS IS UNLIKE YOU KNOW I CAN

02:43:27.397 --> 02:43:28.532
SOMETIMES UNDERSTAND STUDENTS

02:43:28.598 --> 02:43:29.666
BECAUSE STUDENTS REALLY CAN MAKE

02:43:29.733 --> 02:43:31.234
THE TIME TO DO WHATEVER THEY

02:43:31.301 --> 02:43:32.602
WANT TO DO YOU KNOW BEGIN SOME

02:43:32.669 --> 02:43:34.004
SLACK THEIR YOUNG WHATEVER.

02:43:34.070 --> 02:43:36.206
YOU KNOW BUT BUT IF IT WAS A

02:43:36.273 --> 02:43:37.507
PARTY GOING ON YOU KNOW

02:43:37.574 --> 02:43:47.517
EVERYBODY BE DEAR AND SO -- SO I

02:43:47.584 --> 02:43:49.853
UNDERSTAND THAT.

02:43:49.920 --> 02:43:51.021
I'M I'M I'M JUST SAYING IT ON

02:43:51.087 --> 02:43:52.122
CAMPUS AS I UNDERSTAND THAT THE

02:43:52.189 --> 02:43:53.356
STUDENTS WILL FIGURE IT OUT IF

02:43:53.423 --> 02:43:53.990
THEY REALLY WANT TO BECAUSE IT

02:43:54.057 --> 02:43:55.158
UBER LIFT ALL OVER THE WORLD

02:43:55.225 --> 02:43:55.358
OKAY.

02:43:55.425 --> 02:43:57.627
BUT BUT PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:43:57.694 --> 02:43:58.628
INCARCERATED WILL LOCKED UP OR

02:43:58.695 --> 02:43:59.196
AT THE MERCY.

02:43:59.262 --> 02:43:59.863
OF OF THE SHERIFF IN THE JAILER

02:43:59.930 --> 02:44:01.031
AND ALL THESE OTHER PEOPLE WHO

02:44:01.097 --> 02:44:02.399
MAY NOT GIVE THEM THE MATERIAL

02:44:02.465 --> 02:44:03.833
AND SO I THOUGHT ON THIS PODCAST

02:44:03.900 --> 02:44:04.668
ARE A LOT OF COMMUNITY

02:44:04.734 --> 02:44:05.202
ORGANIZATION WAS SAYING.

02:44:05.268 --> 02:44:06.169
YOU KNOW WE HAVE THIS AS OUR

02:44:06.236 --> 02:44:07.137
MISSION WE GO INTO JAILS WE TAKE

02:44:07.204 --> 02:44:08.738
MATERIAL WE EXPLAIN THINGS AND

02:44:08.805 --> 02:44:10.340
WE CAN'T GET THROUGH THIS SUCH

02:44:10.407 --> 02:44:12.142
AN ABEER YOUR THAT YOU KNOW YOU

02:44:12.209 --> 02:44:13.143
CAN'T BRING CERTAIN PEOPLE YOU

02:44:13.210 --> 02:44:14.711
CAN'T HAVE THIS KIND OF AND SO.

02:44:14.778 --> 02:44:16.479
SOME JAILS DO NOT GET THE

02:44:16.546 --> 02:44:17.647
BENEFIT OF COULD NOT PROFIT

THAT WE ARE REHABILITATED MORE

02:57:36.512 --> 02:57:38.214

02:57:49.725 --> 02:57:51.093
THEN YOU'RE VOTING RIGHTS ARE

WHOLE THAT WHOLE PROCESS RIGHT.

02:58:04.073 --> 02:58:05.441

02:58:05.508 --> 02:58:06.609
SAYING HERE TODAY THAT.

02:58:06.675 --> 02:58:08.611
HE OF EUROPEAN ABOUT WHATEVER IT

WAS THAT CAUSE YOU TO BE

02:58:10.312 --> 02:58:11.680
INCARCERATED IN THE FIRST PLACE

AND YOU WANT TO PARTICIPATE

02:58:12.882 --> 02:58:14.316
AGAIN AND THAT'S CERTAINLY.

02:58:14.383 --> 02:58:15.951
SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE AND I

02:58:16.018 --> 02:58:17.753
THINK EVERYBODY PRIDE THAT

02:58:17.820 --> 02:58:18.654
EVERYBODY AT THIS TABLE BELIEVES

02:58:18.721 --> 02:58:20.723
IN I JUST SEE IT AS A POLICY

02:58:20.790 --> 02:58:22.191
MATTER THAT THAT SHOULD BE DONE

02:58:22.258 --> 02:58:24.527
AFTER PEARL IS COMPLETE.

02:58:24.593 --> 02:58:25.961
YOU'VE COMPLETED YOUR TERMS --

02:58:26.028 --> 02:58:27.430
YOU'VE MET WITH ALL THE

02:58:27.496 --> 02:58:28.931
REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR PAROLE --

02:58:28.998 --> 02:58:30.599
AND THEN I THINK ABSOLUTELY YOU

02:58:30.666 --> 02:58:33.069
KNOW YOU SHOULD BE PARTICIPATING

02:58:33.135 --> 02:58:34.870
IN R. N. N. AND ALL THOSE THINGS

02:58:34.937 --> 02:58:37.540
AND ALL OF YOUR RIGHTS HAVE BEEN

02:58:37.606 --> 02:58:38.941
FULLY RESTORED.

02:58:39.008 --> 02:58:40.142
SO THAT'S HOW I LOOK AT IT FROM

02:58:40.209 --> 02:58:41.677
A POLICY MATTERS.

02:58:41.744 --> 02:58:43.579
I DO HAVE TO FACT CHECK -- MY

02:58:43.646 --> 02:58:45.147
COLLEAGUES WHO I HAVE A LOT OF

02:58:45.214 --> 02:58:48.184
RESPECT -- FOR FROM SACRAMENTO --

02:58:48.250 --> 02:58:49.885
BECAUSE THIS GOT BROUGHT I MEAN

02:58:49.952 --> 02:58:50.519
THIS HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP A LOT

02:58:50.586 --> 02:58:51.053
TO IT.

02:58:51.120 --> 02:58:52.922
THAT THE THAT SOMEHOW MAYBE THE

02:58:52.988 --> 02:58:54.590
PARTISAN BREAKDOWN IS THE SAME I

02:58:54.657 --> 02:58:57.359
GET IT THEY DID THE ONLY STUDY

02:58:57.426 --> 02:58:58.661
THAT HAS BEEN DONE.

02:58:58.727 --> 02:59:03.332
ON ON FLORIDA ACTUALLY -- IS

02:59:03.399 --> 02:59:04.934
THEY REVIEWED ONE POINT FIVE

02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:06.302
MILLION EX FELONS IN FLORIDA WHO

02:59:06.368 --> 02:59:08.671
COULD NOT VOTE -- PREVIOUSLY BUT

02:59:08.737 --> 02:59:10.339
WERE GIVEN RIGHTS TO VOTE A

02:59:10.406 --> 02:59:12.808
DECADE AGO UNDER CHARLIE CRIST.

02:59:12.875 --> 02:59:14.343
AND WHAT THEY WHAT THEY FOUND IN

02:59:14.410 --> 02:59:16.312
THAT STUDY.

02:59:16.378 --> 02:59:18.747
WAS THAT -- OF THE NINETEEN

02:59:18.814 --> 02:59:19.348
THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED EXPENSE

02:59:19.415 --> 02:59:20.483
HIS RIGHTS WERE RESTORED UNDER

02:59:20.549 --> 02:59:21.383
CRIST.

02:59:21.450 --> 02:59:23.686
ABOUT 58% WERE REGISTERED

02:59:23.752 --> 02:59:26.755
DEMOCRATS. 24% WERE REGISTERED

02:59:26.822 --> 02:59:27.990
REPUBLICANS.

02:59:28.057 --> 02:59:29.625
AND THE REST REGISTERED WITH

02:59:29.692 --> 02:59:30.793
NEITHER PARTY.

02:59:30.860 --> 02:59:32.128
SO THAT'S THE ONLY REAL STUDY WE

02:59:32.194 --> 02:59:33.295
SEE AS HOW THAT PARTISAN

02:59:33.362 --> 02:59:35.464
BREAKDOWN GETS MADE AND I JUST I

02:59:35.531 --> 02:59:36.966
DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY

02:59:37.032 --> 02:59:39.135
DEFINITIVE PROOF -- MAYBE OTHER

02:59:39.201 --> 02:59:41.370
THAN JARED KUSHNER SAYING THAT --

02:59:41.437 --> 02:59:44.473
YOU KNOW ON A ON A TV INTERVIEW.

02:59:44.540 --> 02:59:45.841
THAT THERE'S MORE REGISTERED

02:59:45.908 --> 02:59:48.978
REPUBLICANS -- YOU KNOW WHO ARE

02:59:49.044 --> 02:59:50.112
THAT.

02:59:50.179 --> 02:59:51.413
STRAIGHT AFTER THEY'VE HAD THEIR

02:59:51.480 --> 02:59:53.282
RIGHTSRESTORED AS FELL AND SO I

02:59:53.349 --> 02:59:55.084
JUST JUST FOR THE RECORD I MEAN

02:59:55.151 --> 02:59:56.886
THAT'S THE DATA THAT'S OUT THERE --

02:59:56.952 --> 02:59:58.821
THEN THE LATEST CHANGE IN

02:59:58.888 --> 03:00:00.856
FLORIDA HAS NOT BEEN EVALUATED

03:00:00.923 --> 03:00:01.457
YET.

03:00:01.524 --> 03:00:02.591
BECAUSE THEY JUST HAVEN'T HAD

03:00:02.658 --> 03:00:04.960
ENOUGH TIME TO EVALUATE.

03:00:05.027 --> 03:00:06.162
I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT

03:00:06.228 --> 03:00:07.730
NECESSARILY MATTERS.

03:00:07.796 --> 03:00:08.531
I DON'T KNOW WHY WE NEED TO

03:00:08.597 --> 03:00:09.932
WOULD NECESSARILY TO BRING IT UP

03:00:09.999 --> 03:00:12.101
WHAT YOU'RE PARTISAN BREAKDOWN

03:00:12.168 --> 03:00:13.736
IS BUT JUST.

03:00:13.802 --> 03:00:15.271
THE FACTS OF WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS

03:00:15.337 --> 03:00:16.038
THAT.

03:00:16.105 --> 03:00:17.540
THEY DO TEND TO BE MORE REGISTER

03:00:17.606 --> 03:00:19.642
TO THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

03:00:19.708 --> 03:00:21.210
SO THE WAS RUSHER.

03:00:21.277 --> 03:00:22.678
ANY OTHER ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS

03:00:22.745 --> 03:00:23.812
OR COMMENTS IN COLLEAGUES ARE

03:00:23.879 --> 03:00:25.848
MOTIONS OR SECONDS.

03:00:25.915 --> 03:00:27.583
WELL YOU KNOW I I APPRECIATE

03:00:27.650 --> 03:00:28.984
THAT WHAT YOU'VE DONE AND I

03:00:29.051 --> 03:00:30.686
THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT AS AS

03:00:30.753 --> 03:00:31.787
WE TALK ABOUT.

03:00:31.854 --> 03:00:33.189
THE CONCEPT OF BOATING AND GET

03:00:33.255 --> 03:00:35.991
PAST THE HISTORIC KIND OF

03:00:36.058 --> 03:00:37.693
REALITY THAT WE'VE HAD AS IT IN

03:00:37.760 --> 03:00:39.795
TERMS OF INCARCERATION AS A

03:00:39.862 --> 03:00:41.530
BEING A VERY PUNITIVE THING.

03:00:41.597 --> 03:00:42.431
THAT.

03:00:42.498 --> 03:00:44.066
HAS DONE MORE DESTRUCTION THAN

03:00:44.133 --> 03:00:45.768
THAN GOOD IN TERMS OF BUILDING

03:00:45.834 --> 03:00:47.403
INDIVIDUALS AND WE SEE THAT --

03:00:47.469 --> 03:00:49.071
IN TERMS OF WHAT HAPPENS WITH

03:00:49.138 --> 03:00:51.307
RECIDIVISM AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

03:00:51.373 --> 03:00:52.708
PEOPLE ARE INCARCERATED AND

03:00:52.775 --> 03:00:54.376
DON'T GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO

03:00:54.443 --> 03:00:55.844
REBUILD THEIR LIVES TO COME BACK

03:00:55.911 --> 03:00:58.013
AND SO FORTH AND SO ON SO OUR

03:00:58.080 --> 03:00:58.914
JUDICIAL.

03:00:58.981 --> 03:00:59.114
ARE.

03:00:59.181 --> 03:01:00.716
OUR OUR PRISON SYSTEM HAS BEEN

03:01:00.783 --> 03:01:03.886
VERY DESTRUCTIVE -- IN IN A LOT

03:01:03.953 --> 03:01:04.987
OF WAYS IT HAS IN THIS SAY TO ME

03:01:05.054 --> 03:01:06.589
THIS ANY SAFER -- SURE THEY'RE

03:01:06.655 --> 03:01:07.489
PEOPLE WHO WILL ALWAYS HAVE TO

03:01:07.556 --> 03:01:08.991
GO TO PRISON BUT WE I THINK WE

03:01:09.058 --> 03:01:10.726
ALL RECOGNIZE TO SEVENTY STAND

03:01:10.793 --> 03:01:11.427
CALIFORNIA WE'VE OVER

03:01:11.493 --> 03:01:12.294
INCARCERATED.

03:01:12.361 --> 03:01:14.196
AND PART OF THAT MENTALITY IS AT

03:01:14.263 --> 03:01:15.698
ONE POINT WE DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE

03:01:15.764 --> 03:01:17.099
CLASSES WE DIDN'T WANT TO

03:01:17.166 --> 03:01:18.267
IMPROVE THEMSELVES AND NOW WE'RE

03:01:18.334 --> 03:01:20.236
COMING BACK FROM THERE THANK GOD.

03:01:20.302 --> 03:01:21.971
OF AND AND WE SHOULD BE MOVING

03:01:22.037 --> 03:01:23.672
TOWARD A POSITION WHERE PEOPLE

03:01:23.739 --> 03:01:25.874
STILL ALL HAVE RIGHTS AND STILL

03:01:25.941 --> 03:01:27.009
EXIST HAVE RIGHTS WENT WHEN

03:01:27.076 --> 03:01:28.344
THEY'RE INCARCERATED AS WELL.

03:01:28.410 --> 03:01:30.012
AND VOTING IS ONE OF THOSE MOST

03:01:30.079 --> 03:01:31.146
AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS IN THIS

03:01:31.213 --> 03:01:33.449
WHOLE COUNTRY WAS BUILT ON THE

03:01:33.515 --> 03:01:35.484
WHOLE ISSUE OF NO TAXATION

03:01:35.551 --> 03:01:36.885
WITHOUT REPRESENTATION.

03:01:36.952 --> 03:01:37.853
THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR

03:01:37.920 --> 03:01:39.121
GOVERNMENT UNLESS WE HAVE AN

03:01:39.188 --> 03:01:40.689
OPPORTUNITY DECIDE WHO'S GOING

03:01:40.756 --> 03:01:41.790
TO REPRESENT US THAT'S A

03:01:41.857 --> 03:01:43.225
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE THAT THAT

03:01:43.292 --> 03:01:44.893
STARTED THE REVOLUTION FOR THIS

03:01:44.960 --> 03:01:45.594
COUNTRY.

03:01:45.661 --> 03:01:47.863
NOW FOR ME PRO PEOPLE GET OUT OF

03:01:47.930 --> 03:01:48.998
PRISON ANYMORE EITHER IN PRISON

03:01:49.064 --> 03:01:50.933
ARE BEING TAXED THERE'S TAXATION

03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:52.935
NEW PAYING PROPERTY TAXES YOU'RE

03:01:53.002 --> 03:01:53.402
PAYING.

03:01:53.469 --> 03:01:56.105
OF SALES TAX YOU'RE BEING TAXED

03:01:56.171 --> 03:01:57.640
AND YET YOU CAN'T DEFINE OR

03:01:57.706 --> 03:01:59.174
DETERMINE WHAT PEOPLE UP HERE

03:01:59.241 --> 03:02:00.909
ARE GOING TO REPRESENT YOU IN

03:02:00.976 --> 03:02:02.244
TERMS OF THAT TAXATION.

03:02:02.311 --> 03:02:09.318
THAT'S A FUNDAMENTAL AMERICAN

03:02:09.385 --> 03:02:11.086
PRINCIPLES THAT WE HAVE SCHOOL

03:02:11.153 --> 03:02:12.187
IT OVER FOR FOR OVER FOUR

03:02:12.254 --> 03:02:12.788
HUNDRED YEARS IN TERMS OF NO

03:02:12.855 --> 03:02:13.656
TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION

03:02:13.722 --> 03:02:14.189
AND THAT IS A FUNDAMENTAL

03:02:14.256 --> 03:02:15.324
PRINCIPLE OF THIS NATION.

03:02:15.391 --> 03:02:17.192
AND WHY WE SUPPOSEDLY BEGAN THIS

03:02:17.259 --> 03:02:18.927
DEMOCRATIC -- EXPERIMENT SO I I

03:02:18.994 --> 03:02:20.262
TOTALLY SUPPORT THE EFFORT I I

03:02:20.329 --> 03:02:20.929
YOU KNOW AND EVENTUALLY I THINK

03:02:20.996 --> 03:02:21.997
AT SOME POINT CALIFORNIA WILL GO

03:02:22.064 --> 03:02:23.666
FURTHER WHEN HE REALIZES WHAT IS

LENGTHY DISCUSSION OR MAYBE NOT

03:03:53.956 --> 03:03:55.591
ABOUT THIS POLICY WHEN THE

03:03:55.657 --> 03:03:57.926
COMMITTEE CONSIDERS A CA SIX I

03:03:57.993 --> 03:03:58.994
AM AND I JUST WAS OUT I DIDN'T

03:03:59.061 --> 03:04:00.129
REFLEXIVELY.

03:04:00.195 --> 03:04:01.663

03:04:01.730 --> 03:04:03.499
ABOUT IT I WENT BACK AND I DID

03:04:03.565 --> 03:04:05.134
SOME RESEARCH I DID SOME

03:04:05.200 --> 03:04:06.034
RESEARCH ON WHAT OTHER STATES

03:04:06.101 --> 03:04:07.403
ACROSS THE COUNTRY DID DID A

03:04:07.469 --> 03:04:08.537
LITTLE THINKING ABOUT.

03:04:08.604 --> 03:04:10.906
THE CONCEPT OF HAVING PAROLEES

03:04:10.973 --> 03:04:12.808
HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE AND IT'S

03:04:12.875 --> 03:04:13.008

SAME AS BEING IN PRISON

03:04:20.916 --> 03:04:22.184
OBVIOUSLY AND SO I THINK IT

03:04:22.251 --> 03:04:23.886
MAKES SENSE. TO AT TO ADD THE

03:04:23.952 --> 03:04:25.587

FINISHING UP YOUR SENTENCE --

03:04:30.092 --> 03:04:32.327

WANT TO RE INTEGRATE EVERYBODY

03:04:42.671 --> 03:04:44.273
BACK INTO SOCIETY AND REDUCE THE

03:04:44.339 --> 03:04:46.275

PROMOTING THE RIGHT TO VOTE.

03:06:10.058 --> 03:06:11.360
OUR STATE ELECTION LAWS HAVE

STATE LAWS REFLECT THIS GROW

03:06:31.947 --> 03:06:32.848
REALITY.

03:06:32.915 --> 03:06:34.683
HOWEVER SADLY DURING THOSE SAME

03:06:34.750 --> 03:06:36.552
MID TERM ELECTIONS IT BECAME

03:06:36.618 --> 03:06:38.120
EVIDENT THAT THERE ARE FLAWS IN

OUR SYSTEM THAT MUST BE FIXED.

03:06:40.489 --> 03:06:41.623
THERE ARE MANY INSTANCES OF

03:06:41.690 --> 03:06:42.858
VOTERS WHO DO NOT RECEIVE THEIR

03:06:42.925 --> 03:06:44.226

03:06:58.240 --> 03:06:59.274
SOME VOTERS EXCEEDING THE

CALIFORNIA VOTER PROTECTION ACT

03:06:59.975 --> 03:07:01.577
WILL HELP FIX THIS IN TWO WAYS

03:07:01.643 --> 03:07:03.345
FIRST IT WILL REQUIRE COUNTY

03:07:03.412 --> 03:07:04.446

03:07:04.513 --> 03:07:06.615

IN CURRENT LAW BEFORE ELECTION

03:07:18.627 --> 03:07:20.762
DAY LET ME BE CLEAR THIS IS NOT

03:07:20.829 --> 03:07:22.998
CHANGED THE EXISTING TIMELINE

03:07:23.065 --> 03:07:25.667
WHEN A BALLOT MUST BE SENT OUT.

03:07:25.734 --> 03:07:26.868
IT ONLY REQUIRES THAT THESE

03:07:26.935 --> 03:07:28.837
BALLOTS BE MAILED OUT WITHIN

03:07:28.904 --> 03:07:30.472

03:07:41.350 --> 03:07:42.985
EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE AND

03:07:43.051 --> 03:07:44.786
GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO

PAYING ON AN HOURLY RATE WHICH

03:27:18.192 --> 03:27:19.527
