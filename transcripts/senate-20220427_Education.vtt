00:36:26.984 --> 00:36:29.453
FACT THAT. IF THE CDPH DID NOT

REQUIREMENT TO OUR SCHOOL

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:40.331
DISTRICTS IN THEIR THE CDPH- WHY

00:36:40.398 --> 00:36:43.134
DO YOU FEEL COMPELLED TO. MAKE

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:44.902
THIS A MANDATE FOR THE STATE.

00:36:44.969 --> 00:36:46.037
WELL I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

00:36:46.103 --> 00:36:47.872
FIRST OF ALL EVERY CHILD HAS A

00:36:47.939 --> 00:36:49.674
RIGHT TO AN EDUCATION IT'S IN

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:50.908
THE CONSTITUTION WE ALSO HAVE TO

00:36:50.975 --> 00:36:52.543
ENSURE THAT CHILDREN ARE ABLE TO

00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:54.612
ATTEND SCHOOL SAFELY. IT'S

00:36:54.679 --> 00:36:55.846
IMPORTANT PARENTS ACTUALLY KNOW

00:36:55.913 --> 00:36:57.114
THEIR CHILDREN HAVE BEEN

00:36:57.181 --> 00:36:59.584
EXPOSED- TO- TO THE SPEAKERS AT

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:01.018
SCHOOL. SO IT IS IMPORTANT THAT

00:37:01.085 --> 00:37:02.587
ACTUALLY OUR PARENTS NEED TO BE

00:37:02.653 --> 00:37:04.221
INFORMED YOU HAVE PARENTS TO

00:37:04.288 --> 00:37:05.923
EITHER CHILD MAY BE VULNERABLE

00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:07.959
THEMSELVES- THEY MAY HAVE A

00:37:08.025 --> 00:37:08.793
CHRONIC CONDITION LIKE ASTHMA OR

00:37:08.859 --> 00:37:11.195
DIABETES- THEY MAY ALSO HAVE

00:37:11.262 --> 00:37:13.030
FAMILY MEMBERS AT HOME WHO MAY

00:37:13.097 --> 00:37:14.999
BE AT RISK RIGHT SO. MAYBE

00:37:15.066 --> 00:37:17.068
THERE'S A- A GRANDPARENT AT HOME

00:37:17.134 --> 00:37:19.270
OR A BAR OR OTHER OTHER PERSON

00:37:19.337 --> 00:37:21.439
AT HOME AND SO IT PARENTS NEED

00:37:21.505 --> 00:37:23.007
TO KNOW IF THEIR CHILD GOT

00:37:23.074 --> 00:37:26.110
EXPOSED. AND MIGHT BE INFECTED

00:37:26.177 --> 00:37:28.012
THAT THEY CAN PROTECT THEIR

00:37:28.079 --> 00:37:30.748
HOUSEHOLD AND TO PROTECT YOUR

00:37:30.815 --> 00:37:32.250
CHILD THAT'S WHY TESTING PLANS

00:37:32.316 --> 00:37:33.784
ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S A

00:37:33.851 --> 00:37:35.653
VERY IMPORTANT THAT. WE HAVE THE

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:37.121
INFORMATION. THEY NEED TO KEEP

00:37:37.188 --> 00:37:38.055
THEIR- OF THEIR CHILD AND THEIR

00:37:38.122 --> 00:37:39.724
HOUSEHOLD SAFE. AND SO TESTING

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:41.025
PLANS ARE IMPORTANT PART OF

00:37:41.092 --> 00:37:42.360
THAT. AGAIN THESE ARE TESTING

00:37:42.426 --> 00:37:43.294

00:38:18.329 --> 00:38:20.698
SPECIALLY WHEN THE CDPH DOES NOT

00:38:20.765 --> 00:38:22.166
IRATE I'M JUST GONNA I'M A

00:38:22.233 --> 00:38:24.068
LITTLE HESITANT TO BE HONEST AND

00:38:24.135 --> 00:38:25.036
I WOULD PROBABLY NOT BE

00:38:25.102 --> 00:38:26.437
SUPPORTING ACTION WILL BE

00:38:26.504 --> 00:38:28.673
SUPPORT WITHOUT TODAY OKAY HOW

00:38:28.739 --> 00:38:31.142
DOES FOR THAT BUT I REALLY

00:38:31.208 --> 00:38:31.742
BELIEVE THAT OUR LOCAL SKIP

00:38:31.809 --> 00:38:32.276
SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE THE

00:38:32.343 --> 00:38:34.812
CAPACITY TO IMPLEMENT PROTOCOLS

00:38:34.879 --> 00:38:38.749
THAT AB. THE SENIOR- NEEDED FOR

00:38:38.816 --> 00:38:41.052
THEIR REGION OR FOR THEIR FOR

00:38:41.118 --> 00:38:43.421
THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICT AND- IT'S

00:38:43.487 --> 00:38:45.289
NOT AS IF IT'S NOT AVAILABLE FOR

00:38:45.356 --> 00:38:48.359
THEM AS WELL AS VACCINES AND SO-

00:38:48.426 --> 00:38:50.661
I'M NOT SURE THAT THIS IS

00:38:50.728 --> 00:38:52.730
ACTUALLY REQUIRED- BUT- I AM

00:38:52.797 --> 00:38:54.532
GRATEFUL THAT THE MONEY'S THERE

00:38:54.598 --> 00:38:55.299
FOR THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WOULD

00:38:55.366 --> 00:38:58.469
WISH TO IMPLEMENT. A PLAN AND I

00:38:58.536 --> 00:39:01.005
TRULY DO BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD

00:39:01.072 --> 00:39:02.440
ALLOW OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS YOU

00:39:02.506 --> 00:39:04.775
DECIDE WHAT WORKS BEST. LOCALLY

00:39:04.842 --> 00:39:06.477
AND IF THE LOCAL SCHOOL

00:39:06.544 --> 00:39:11.348
DISTRICTS DO NOT- FOLLOW PLANNED

00:39:11.415 --> 00:39:13.884
IT SEEMS APPROPRIATE- A LOCAL

00:39:13.951 --> 00:39:16.387
PARENTS DISAGREE THEY HAVE THE

00:39:16.454 --> 00:39:19.190
OPTION TO ADVOCATE FOR WHAT FOR

00:39:19.256 --> 00:39:22.126
WHAT THEY FEEL IS APPROPRIATE

00:39:22.193 --> 00:39:24.061
AND NEEDED WITHIN THEIR

00:39:24.128 --> 00:39:26.363
DISTRICTS. SO I'M NOT I'M NOT

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:28.032
FRONT AND THE FACT THAT OF THE

00:39:28.099 --> 00:39:30.167
IMPACT THAT WILL HAVE LOCALLY

00:39:30.234 --> 00:39:32.369

THAT. MOSTLY ALL PEOPLE WHO MAKE

00:40:38.169 --> 00:40:40.304
THESE TEST. AND ARE PROFITING

00:40:40.371 --> 00:40:42.807
OFF OF. THE OF SELLING OF THESE

00:40:42.873 --> 00:40:44.108

WE WOULD NEED TO BE TESTING ARE.

00:40:57.321 --> 00:40:58.889
OUR CHILDREN. SO FIRST OF ALL-

00:40:58.956 --> 00:40:59.390
CENTER DOLLY THOUGHT THE

00:40:59.456 --> 00:41:01.358
RESPECT. THOSE PEOPLE SUPPORTING

00:41:01.425 --> 00:41:03.494
THIS BILL ARE NOT PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:41:03.561 --> 00:41:05.963
PROFITING. FROM TESTING. AND I

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:07.097
FIND IT DISAPPOINTING THAT YOU

00:41:07.164 --> 00:41:09.066
WOULD LEVEL THAT KIND OF

00:41:09.133 --> 00:41:11.869
ACCUSATION. IF YOU LOOK AT THE

00:41:11.936 --> 00:41:14.471
LIST OF SUPPORTERS MOST OF THE

00:41:14.538 --> 00:41:15.272
SUPPORTERS VAST MAJORITY OF

00:41:15.339 --> 00:41:16.907
SUPPORTERS ARE NOT PEOPLE WHO

00:41:16.974 --> 00:41:18.776
WOULD IN ANY WAY PROFIT.

00:41:18.843 --> 00:41:20.544
PACKAGES ENOUGH MANY OF OUR

00:41:20.611 --> 00:41:22.146
PEOPLE- TALK ABOUT SCHOOL

00:41:22.213 --> 00:41:24.415
DISTRICTS- WE HAVE SCHOOL

00:41:24.481 --> 00:41:25.149
DISTRICTS WHO ARE SUPPORTING

00:41:25.216 --> 00:41:26.350
THIS BILL. AND YET YOU'RE

00:41:26.417 --> 00:41:28.452
WORRIED ABOUT THE COST TO SCHOOL

00:41:28.519 --> 00:41:29.353
DISTRICTS BUT THEY SEE HOW

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:31.188
IMPORTANT IT IS. TO KEEP THE

00:41:31.255 --> 00:41:33.224
SCHOOLS SAFE TO KEEP THE KIDS

00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:35.459
SAFE AND ALSO BECAUSE PARENTS

00:41:35.526 --> 00:41:36.894
WANTED. AND WE ALSO OUGHT TO

00:41:36.961 --> 00:41:37.928
MAKE NOTE THAT MANY YOUTH

00:41:37.995 --> 00:41:39.063
ORGANIZATION SUPPORT THIS BILLS

00:41:39.129 --> 00:41:41.699
WELL. SO THE VERY STUDENTS

00:41:41.765 --> 00:41:43.367
THEMSELVES SOME OF WHOM OF

00:41:43.434 --> 00:41:45.536
ACTUALLY PROTESTED AT THE SCHOOL

00:41:45.603 --> 00:41:47.071
DISTRICTS WITH OTHER SCHOOL

00:41:47.137 --> 00:41:48.138
DISTRICTS WERE ACTING. STRONGLY

00:41:48.205 --> 00:41:53.143
ENOUGH- SO I WOULD SET ITSELF I

00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:54.712
WOULD SAY IS THAT- FIRST OF ALL

00:41:54.778 --> 00:41:56.180
I WOULD HAVE TO STRONGLY

00:41:56.247 --> 00:41:57.615
DISAGREE WITH WHAT YOU'VE SAID

00:41:57.681 --> 00:41:59.817
THAT CONTENTION. I WOULD ALSO

00:41:59.884 --> 00:42:03.254
MAKE NOTE THAT- YES IT WOULD NOT

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:04.455
ACTUALLY- THE BILL ITSELF WOULD

00:42:04.521 --> 00:42:06.056
NOT TAKE EFFECT JANET FIRST.

00:42:06.123 --> 00:42:08.259
UNTIL J. FIRST TWENTY THREE

00:42:08.325 --> 00:42:09.059
WOULD SIGN. PASSED AND SIGNED

00:42:09.126 --> 00:42:11.428
THE LAW. HOWEVER THAT DOESN'T I

00:42:11.495 --> 00:42:13.297
THINK IT'S- THAT DOESN'T MEAN

00:42:13.364 --> 00:42:14.798
THAT WE CAN'T ACTUALLY IN FACT

00:42:14.865 --> 00:42:16.200
MANY TIMES WE HAVE BILLS THERE'S

00:42:16.267 --> 00:42:17.968
THAT MAYBE SOME IMPLEMENTATION.

00:42:18.035 --> 00:42:19.470
TIME AS WELL AND SO WEAK THAT

00:42:19.536 --> 00:42:21.372
THERE WOULD BE. THAT TIME FOR

00:42:21.438 --> 00:42:23.340
FIRST FOR GUARANTEED TO DO THE

00:42:23.407 --> 00:42:25.609
WORK BUT I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT

00:42:25.676 --> 00:42:29.847
THAT- THAT. BUT IT WAS BEEN

00:42:29.914 --> 00:42:32.349
FOLLOWING KOBE NINETEEN IT IS

00:42:32.416 --> 00:42:34.985
ACTUALLY A CREDIBLE. SCIENTISTS

00:42:35.052 --> 00:42:37.388
EPIDEMIOLOGISTS THIS IS SAYING

00:42:37.454 --> 00:42:39.089
THAT THIS THING'S OVER RIGHT AND

00:42:39.156 --> 00:42:41.292
BY THE WAY WHEN YOU SAY

00:42:41.358 --> 00:42:41.959
SOMETHING IS ENDEMIC IT DOESN'T

00:42:42.026 --> 00:42:43.527
MEAN IT'S OVER EITHER FOR

00:42:43.594 --> 00:42:46.163
EXAMPLE POLIO IS ENDEMIC. PRIOR

00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:49.066
TO THE- POLIO VACCINE. I WASN'T

00:42:49.133 --> 00:42:53.370
EMIC. THAT'S STILL CREATED

00:42:53.437 --> 00:42:55.472
PROBLEMS FOR CHILDREN BECAUSE HE

00:42:55.539 --> 00:42:57.608
HAD IT FOR FAMILIES BECAUSE YOUR

00:42:57.675 --> 00:42:59.176
CHILDREN WHO ARE PARALYZED. AND

00:42:59.243 --> 00:43:00.844
EVERY SUMMER PARENTS WOULD LIVE

00:43:00.911 --> 00:43:03.247
IN FEAR ABOUT THEIR CHILD

00:43:03.314 --> 00:43:04.348
POTENTIALLY BECOMING PARALYZED.

00:43:04.415 --> 00:43:07.451
BY THIS VIRUS IS ENDEMIC VIRUS.

00:43:07.518 --> 00:43:11.488
RIGHT YOU KNOW RUBELLA WAS

00:43:11.555 --> 00:43:14.258
ENDEMIC. BUT IT CAUSED BIRTH

00:43:14.325 --> 00:43:17.394
DEFECTS IN PREGNANT WOMEN. RIGHT

00:43:17.461 --> 00:43:20.264
SO WE TAKE MITIGATION MEASURES

00:43:20.331 --> 00:43:23.367
ACTUALLY BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT

00:43:23.434 --> 00:43:24.268
THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF THE

00:43:24.335 --> 00:43:26.136
DISEASE AND I WOULD POINT OUT

00:43:26.203 --> 00:43:28.038
THAT WELL CERTAINLY TALK TALK

00:43:28.105 --> 00:43:30.474
ABOUT DEATH IN MY PRESENTATION

00:43:30.541 --> 00:43:31.775
IN FACT TOO MANY CHILDREN HAVE

00:43:31.842 --> 00:43:34.945
DIED. OF CALVIN THAT IS NOT THE

00:43:35.012 --> 00:43:38.382
ONLY OUTCOME. WHAT WE KNOW NOW.

00:43:38.449 --> 00:43:42.119
IS THAT RATES OF DIABETES YOU'RE

00:43:42.186 --> 00:43:43.354
OUT AFTER SOMEONE GETS COBIT.

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:47.424
THIS HIGHER. SO YEAH WE DON'T DO

00:43:47.491 --> 00:43:49.159
WE WANT MORE CASES DIABETES WE

00:43:49.226 --> 00:43:50.995
KNOW RATES OF HEART DISEASE ARE

00:43:51.061 --> 00:43:53.297
MUCH HIGHER AFTER SOMEONE GETS

00:43:53.364 --> 00:43:55.132
CODED. WE'VE SEEN RESEARCH THAT

00:43:55.199 --> 00:43:57.167
SHOWS THAT THERE IS BRAIN

00:43:57.234 --> 00:43:59.636
DAMAGE. AND PEOPLE WHO'VE HAD

00:43:59.703 --> 00:44:01.405
COATED AND DILATES NOT JUST

00:44:01.472 --> 00:44:03.240
SEVERE BECAUSE OF IT IT'S EVEN

00:44:03.307 --> 00:44:05.309
MILD COATED. SO LONG COVE IT

00:44:05.376 --> 00:44:06.076
OTHER TYPES OF POST CODE

00:44:06.143 --> 00:44:08.846
SYMPTOMS THESE ARE IMPORTANT-

00:44:08.912 --> 00:44:10.781
THAT WE THINK THAT WE NEED TO OF

00:44:10.848 --> 00:44:11.915
COURSE WE NEED FURTHER RESEARCH

00:44:11.982 --> 00:44:14.918
TO BETTER DEFINE IT WE HAD A

00:44:14.985 --> 00:44:16.086
WHOLE HEARING ABOUT IN THEIR

00:44:16.153 --> 00:44:17.488
HEALTH COMMITTEE. BUT I DON'T

00:44:17.554 --> 00:44:18.856
THINK ONE WANTS TO BE. YEAH THAT

00:44:18.922 --> 00:44:20.190
CASUAL ABOUT THE IDEA THAT.

00:44:20.257 --> 00:44:23.560
CHILDREN GETTING INFECTED OR

00:44:23.627 --> 00:44:24.194
THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS ARE TO HAVE

00:44:24.261 --> 00:44:25.195
MEMBERS OF THE HOUSEHOLD.

00:44:25.262 --> 00:44:26.663
GETTING INFECTED IS NESTLE GOOD

00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:29.066
THING NOW. WHAT THE TESTING PLAN

00:44:29.133 --> 00:44:31.735
DOES IS THAT IT HELPS INFORMS.

00:44:31.802 --> 00:44:34.304
PARENTS AND FAMILY SO THEY CAN

00:44:34.371 --> 00:44:35.839
MAKE THEIR OWN JUDGMENTS. IN

00:44:35.906 --> 00:44:36.940
TERMS OF WHAT THEY FEEL LIKE

00:44:37.007 --> 00:44:38.175
THEY NEED TO DO TO KEEP THEIR-

00:44:38.242 --> 00:44:40.344
CHILD AND FAMILY SAFE. BUT IF

00:44:40.411 --> 00:44:42.179
THEY DON'T KNOW. THE SCHOOLS

00:44:42.246 --> 00:44:44.415
AREN'T HELPING. BECAUSE AFTER

00:44:44.481 --> 00:44:46.183
ALL THE CHILD SPENDING TIME TO

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:47.317
SCHOOL BUT THEY DON'T KNOW THE

00:44:47.384 --> 00:44:49.820
TALENT BUT AND YOU KNOW AND- YOU

00:44:49.887 --> 00:44:51.855
KNOW YOUR PET. I'M A PARENT

00:44:51.922 --> 00:44:53.757
RIGHT. I MEAN I GET NOTES FROM

00:44:53.824 --> 00:44:54.792
SCHOOL WHENEVER THEY EXPOSE NOT

00:44:54.858 --> 00:44:57.494
JUST TO COPE IT BUT THE OTHER.

00:44:57.561 --> 00:44:58.128
YOU KNOW TRANSMISSIBLE THINGS

00:44:58.195 --> 00:44:59.396
LIKE YOU KNOW YOU MENTIONED EVEN

00:44:59.463 --> 00:45:00.397
HEADLIGHTS WHICH BY THE WAY

00:45:00.464 --> 00:45:03.500
HASN'T AS FAR AS I KNOW HAS

00:45:03.567 --> 00:45:04.334
REALLY TOLD ANYONE. IF YOU DON'T

00:45:04.401 --> 00:45:05.769
TELL THE PARENTS THAT THEIR

00:45:05.836 --> 00:45:06.670
CHILD EXPOSED HEADLIGHTS THEY

00:45:06.737 --> 00:45:08.372
GET UPSET. I USED BY THEIR USED

00:45:08.439 --> 00:45:09.840
TO BE A- POSITION I WAS A

00:45:09.907 --> 00:45:11.108
PHYSICIAN CONSULTANT FOR SCHOOL

00:45:11.175 --> 00:45:11.975
DISTRICT BEFORE OF THE

00:45:12.042 --> 00:45:14.645
LEGISLATURE. OKAY I MEAN  SAW I

00:45:14.711 --> 00:45:16.780
WAS THE PHYSICIAN CONSULTANT FOR

00:45:16.847 --> 00:45:18.415
A FOR OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND

00:45:18.482 --> 00:45:21.151
PARENTS WANT TO KNOW. THAT'S

00:45:49.346 --> 00:45:50.013
BILL IN ANOTHER COMMITTEE RIGHT

CLOTHES BUT PART OF THAT I JUST

00:46:05.129 --> 00:46:05.896
WANT TO ASK ONE QUESTION- THE

00:46:05.963 --> 00:46:07.965
BILL REQUIRES A TESTING PLAN

00:46:08.031 --> 00:46:09.032
RIGHT CORRECT OKAY I THINK

00:46:09.099 --> 00:46:10.968
PEOPLE HAVE CONFLATED THAT THE

00:46:11.034 --> 00:46:13.470
BILL IS GOING TO REQUIRE SCHOOLS

00:46:13.537 --> 00:46:15.305
TO MANDATE TESTING. BUT JUST

00:46:15.372 --> 00:46:17.908
REQUIRING A PLAN I KIND OF THINK

00:46:17.975 --> 00:46:20.310
ABOUT IT AS NGUYEN- THE PANDEMIC

00:46:20.377 --> 00:46:22.012
FIRST STARTED AND WE DIDN'T HAVE

00:46:22.079 --> 00:46:24.848
ENOUGH PP AND SO NOW WE ARE

00:46:24.915 --> 00:46:27.784
REQUIRING HOSPITALS AND NURSING

00:46:27.851 --> 00:46:30.154
ASSOCIATIONS AND WHATNOT. TO

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:31.221
MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE

00:46:31.288 --> 00:46:33.323
PROPER PP SO TO ME THIS IS ABOUT

00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:35.125
PLANNING IN THE EVENT WE HAVE

00:46:35.192 --> 00:46:40.197
ANOTHER PANDEMIC- AND I ALSO

00:46:40.264 --> 00:46:41.832
JUST WANTED TO NOTE. ALL THAT

00:46:41.899 --> 00:46:43.200

00:46:43.267 --> 00:46:44.101

00:46:50.874 --> 00:46:51.775
THEIR PARENTS BECAUSE SOME OF

00:46:51.842 --> 00:46:53.610

NOT- ALLOCATING FUNDING FOR

01:32:38.052 --> 01:32:40.788
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND SOME OF

OUR SCHOOLS ARE IN SEVERE

01:32:43.291 --> 01:32:45.459
DETERIORATION FOR- DEFERRED

01:32:45.526 --> 01:32:46.861
MAINTENANCE AND NOT HAVING THE

01:32:46.928 --> 01:32:48.329
FUNDING I MEAN THE WORKLOAD HAS

01:32:48.396 --> 01:32:51.332
BEEN EXPONENTIAL SO I'M KIND OF

01:32:51.399 --> 01:32:54.435
CURIOUS AS TO ONE AB WHY DIDN'T

01:32:54.502 --> 01:32:57.071
YOU ALLIGATOR OR SORT OF CREATE

01:32:57.138 --> 01:33:01.409
A FUNDING SOURCE OR A- JUST AS A

01:33:01.475 --> 01:33:03.911
MEANS BY WHICH THIS CAN BE DONE

01:33:03.978 --> 01:33:05.212
. THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE

01:33:05.279 --> 01:33:06.948
BESIDES THE FUNDING DOING

01:33:07.014 --> 01:33:08.582
INVESTIGATION DURING THE STUDIES

01:33:08.649 --> 01:33:10.751
KNOWING THAT IT'S THAT THAT

01:33:10.818 --> 01:33:12.420
THERE IS A PROBLEM AN ISSUE

01:33:12.486 --> 01:33:14.121
PUTTING THE NOTICES ON THERE.

01:33:14.188 --> 01:33:15.856
I'M I'M LOOKING AT IT FROM AN

01:33:15.923 --> 01:33:16.991
ATTORNEY'S PERSPECTIVE THE

01:33:17.058 --> 01:33:18.993
LIABILITY THAT COMES ACROSS THE

01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:19.961
STATE AND IS THIS OPEN A

01:33:20.027 --> 01:33:22.430
LITIGATION NIGHTMARE FOR MANY OF

01:33:22.496 --> 01:33:25.533
THESE- FOR THE AGENCIES AND

01:33:25.599 --> 01:33:27.501
DEPARTMENTS. THAT IT NOW ARE

01:33:27.568 --> 01:33:28.502
DISCLOSING THERE'S A PROBLEM

01:33:28.569 --> 01:33:29.904
HERE BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE

01:33:29.971 --> 01:33:31.105
ALLOCATED FUNDING FROM THE STATE

01:33:31.172 --> 01:33:33.374
SO THE LEAGUE LITIGATION I DON'T

01:33:33.441 --> 01:33:35.042
WANT THIS AND I WOULD HATE FOR

01:33:35.109 --> 01:33:37.345
THE STATE TO SPEND MONEY ON

01:33:37.411 --> 01:33:38.479
LITIGATION. VERSUS ALLOCATING

01:33:38.546 --> 01:33:40.748
THE MONEY UP FRONT TO BE ABLE TO

01:33:40.815 --> 01:33:43.351
TAKE CARE OF THIS ISSUE. SO IN

01:33:43.417 --> 01:33:45.786
TERMS OF LITIGATION IF I WERE

01:33:45.853 --> 01:33:47.788
INTENDANT I WOULD BE MUCH MORE

01:33:47.855 --> 01:33:49.790
CONCERNED ABOUT LITIGATION IF A

01:33:49.857 --> 01:33:51.525
CHILD DRINKS CONTAMINATED WATER

01:33:51.592 --> 01:33:53.928
AND GETS SICK OR DIES. RIGHT AT

01:33:53.995 --> 01:33:55.563
RIVER MULTIPLE CHILDREN GOD

01:33:55.629 --> 01:33:57.698
FORBID THAT THAT TO ME IS A

01:33:57.765 --> 01:34:00.334
LITIGATION NIGHTMARE IT IS MUCH

01:34:00.401 --> 01:34:02.570
BETTER FRANKLY FOR EVERYONE FOR

01:34:02.636 --> 01:34:04.372
HELP WILL HELP THE COMMUNITY.

01:34:04.438 --> 01:34:06.674
AND FOR AVOIDING LITIGATION TAX

01:34:06.741 --> 01:34:09.343
YOU KNOW AND SO IF THERE IS

01:34:09.410 --> 01:34:10.711
CONTAMINATION SAY AND A DRINKING

01:34:10.778 --> 01:34:12.947
WATER SYSTEM MAYBE THEY SHUT IT

01:34:13.014 --> 01:34:14.682
OFF UNTIL THEY CAN FIGURE IT OUT

01:34:14.749 --> 01:34:17.752
AND BRING IN- AN EXTERNAL SOURCE

01:34:17.818 --> 01:34:21.288
OF WATER- I DON'T. I CAN'T

01:34:21.355 --> 01:34:23.491
ENVISION ANY ARGUMENT TO SAY

01:34:23.557 --> 01:34:25.026
THAT SCHOOLS SHOULD NOT BE

01:34:25.092 --> 01:34:27.328
REQUIRED TO KNOW IF THEIR WATER

01:34:27.395 --> 01:34:29.563
SYSTEMS ARE CONTAMINATED WITH

01:34:29.630 --> 01:34:32.099
LEAD WITH RADEON WITH WHICH AN

01:34:32.166 --> 01:34:38.139
ALOT- AND. AND THEN THEY CAN

01:34:38.205 --> 01:34:38.839
TAKE ACTION. I AGREE WITH YOU

01:34:38.906 --> 01:34:41.475
THOUSAND. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE A

01:34:41.542 --> 01:34:42.176
MASSIVE INVESTMENT IN OUR AGING.

01:34:42.243 --> 01:34:43.711
SCHOOL AFTER SCHOOL FACILITIES

01:34:43.778 --> 01:34:47.681
FOR- PLUMBING SYSTEM FOR BETTER

01:34:47.748 --> 01:34:49.750
VENTILATION FOR FUNCTIONING.

01:34:49.817 --> 01:34:50.818
TOILETS AND ALL THE OTHER

01:34:50.885 --> 01:34:52.720
PROBLEMS AND I WITHOUT GETTING

01:34:52.787 --> 01:34:54.121
SIDETRACKED I WOULD SAY THIS IS

01:34:54.188 --> 01:34:57.124
WHY. I HAVE MAJOR ISSUES WITH.

01:34:57.191 --> 01:34:58.793
TAKING SO MUCH OF OUR SURPLUS

01:34:58.859 --> 01:35:00.895
AND READY AND SENDING CHECKS TO

01:35:00.961 --> 01:35:04.799
PEOPLE. AS OPPOSED TO USING THIS

01:35:04.865 --> 01:35:07.935
SURPLUS TO FOR EXAMPLE FIX OUR

01:35:08.002 --> 01:35:10.571
SCHOOLS AND A LOT OF POLITICAL

01:35:10.638 --> 01:35:11.705
PRESSURE WERE REGARDING. YOU

01:35:11.772 --> 01:35:13.641
KNOW. SOME MEMBERS OF THE

01:35:13.707 --> 01:35:15.843
LEGISLATURE TO DEMAND THAT WE

01:35:15.910 --> 01:35:17.878
SEND MORE MORE MONEY BACK TO

01:35:17.945 --> 01:35:18.813
TAXPAYERS WHO ARE NOT LOW

01:35:18.879 --> 01:35:21.549
INCOME. AS OPPOSED TO USING THAT

01:35:21.615 --> 01:35:22.883
TO FIX OUR TOILETS AND WATER

01:35:22.950 --> 01:35:25.386
SYSTEMS INPUT FILTER VENTILATION

01:35:25.453 --> 01:35:27.321
SYSTEMS AS WELL I JUST HAVE AN

01:35:27.388 --> 01:35:28.055
ISSUE WITH THAT. THAT'S A

01:35:28.122 --> 01:35:30.391
SEPARATE ISSUE SO I AM ALL FOR

01:35:30.458 --> 01:35:31.992
MASSIVE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:35:32.059 --> 01:35:34.295
INVESTMENT IN OUR SCHOOLS- HOPE

01:35:34.361 --> 01:35:35.796
THAT WE GET THERE. BUT TO BE

01:35:35.863 --> 01:35:38.099
CLEAR THIS. LEGISLATION IS A

01:35:38.165 --> 01:35:40.568
STEP TO SAY LET'S AT LEAST KNOW

01:35:40.634 --> 01:35:42.036
IF WHAT THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM

01:35:42.103 --> 01:35:44.071
AS AND MAKE SURE THAT IF A

01:35:44.138 --> 01:35:45.606
SCHOOL DOES HAVE A CONTAMINATION

01:35:45.673 --> 01:35:47.741
PROBLEM. THAT THE KIDS ARE NOT

01:35:47.808 --> 01:35:49.243
GETTING SICK AND THAT TEACHERS

01:35:49.310 --> 01:35:51.212
AND PARENTS AND KIDS NOW YOU CAN

01:35:51.278 --> 01:35:52.646
MAKE ALTERNATE ARRANGEMENTS IF

01:35:52.713 --> 01:35:54.081
THEY HAVE TO BRING IN BOTTLED

01:35:54.148 --> 01:35:56.784
WATER. THEY CAN DO THAT- BUT NOT

01:35:56.851 --> 01:35:58.919
KNOWING. IS UNACCEPTABLE IN MY

01:35:58.986 --> 01:36:01.255
VIEW. AND I AM COMPLETELY WITH

01:36:01.322 --> 01:36:02.857
YOU WHICH IS WHY I APPRECIATE

AND REALLY RESPECT THE MERITS OF

01:36:04.792 --> 01:36:06.160
THE BILL I JUST WANT TO MAKE

01:36:06.227 --> 01:36:07.928
SURE THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO BE

01:36:07.995 --> 01:36:08.963
DOING THIS THERE WERE ALSO

01:36:09.029 --> 01:36:12.066
PROTECTING FOR MY ABILITY TO

01:36:12.133 --> 01:36:13.701
SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN. IN IN IN

01:36:13.767 --> 01:36:16.770
PLACE- UNTIL THEY- IT FOR TO BE

01:36:16.837 --> 01:36:18.038
ABLE TO CARE OF THE- PROBLEM

01:36:18.105 --> 01:36:19.140
BECAUSE I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH

01:36:19.206 --> 01:36:21.208
YOU. I THINK WE SHOULD BE

01:36:21.275 --> 01:36:22.510
SPENDING OUR OUR RESOURCES AND

01:36:22.576 --> 01:36:23.677
INFRASTRUCTURE WE'VE HAD A

01:36:23.744 --> 01:36:25.746
PROBLEM AND THEREFORE. YOU KNOW

01:36:25.813 --> 01:36:27.448
I'VE HEARD I REMEMBER SEVERAL

01:36:27.515 --> 01:36:28.916
YEARS AGO I ATTENDED A WATER

01:36:28.983 --> 01:36:30.251
SUMMIT IN THE STATE OF.

01:36:30.317 --> 01:36:31.585
CALIFORNIA DOESN'T HAVE SO MUCH

01:36:31.652 --> 01:36:32.987
A WATER PROBLEM BUT MORE OF AN

01:36:33.053 --> 01:36:34.989
INFRASTRUCTURE A PROBLEM THAT WE

01:36:35.055 --> 01:36:36.090
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH OF THE PROJECT

01:36:36.157 --> 01:36:38.292
YOU PLACE AND WE HAVE A VERY

01:36:38.359 --> 01:36:40.294
VERY OLD SYSTEM. IN PLACE THAT

01:36:40.361 --> 01:36:42.196
NEEDS TO BE UPDATED SO I'M

01:36:42.263 --> 01:36:43.831
COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU I JUST

01:36:43.898 --> 01:36:45.432
WANNA MAKE SURE THAT. AND IF

01:36:45.499 --> 01:36:48.502
THIS MOVES FORWARD- THAT. MAYBE

01:36:48.569 --> 01:36:50.371
YOU HAVE A COMMITMENT TO.

01:36:50.437 --> 01:36:53.174
INCLUDE A- A STIPULATION WHAT WE

01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:54.475
ACTUALLY PROTECT THE SCHOOL

01:36:54.542 --> 01:36:59.146
pFUNDING AVAILABLE- THAT THEY CAN

01:36:59.213 --> 01:37:00.281
ONE AS YOU SAID BRING OTHER

01:37:00.347 --> 01:37:01.682
WATER RESOURCES INTO PLACE THAT

01:37:01.749 --> 01:37:03.851
THEY HAVE OTHER OPTIONS BESIDES.

01:37:03.918 --> 01:37:04.618
AND HAVE THE PROTECTION THAT

01:37:04.685 --> 01:37:06.720
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE

01:37:06.787 --> 01:37:08.889
LITIGATED WHAT WHAT I. A I THINK

01:37:08.956 --> 01:37:10.558
THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO BE

01:37:10.624 --> 01:37:11.358
LITIGATED IF THEY ACTUALLY.

01:37:11.425 --> 01:37:13.594
POISONED STUDENTS OVER THE WATER

01:37:13.661 --> 01:37:15.529
POISONS TO INSPECT BUT I WILL

01:37:15.596 --> 01:37:18.199
COMMIT IS THAT GOING FORWARD NOT

01:37:18.265 --> 01:37:20.334
INCOME COMING YEARS. WE NEED TO

01:37:20.401 --> 01:37:22.469
GET MORE FUNDING TO OUR SCHOOLS

01:37:22.536 --> 01:37:25.339
TO ACTUALLY UPDATE THEIR

01:37:25.406 --> 01:37:25.873
PLUMBING SYSTEM. THERE'S

01:37:25.940 --> 01:37:28.576
POPULOUS. SUPPORT FOR THAT- AND

01:37:28.642 --> 01:37:30.144
SO THAT THAT'S WHAT I'M WHO I AM

01:37:30.211 --> 01:37:32.012
I THINK THERE'S GOING TO. BE UP

01:37:32.079 --> 01:37:33.681
THERE WELL I'M CONFIDENT THERE

01:37:33.747 --> 01:37:36.050
WILL BE WORK TO DO THAT. SO IN

01:37:36.116 --> 01:37:38.852
OTHER WORDS. IF THIS BILL WERE

01:37:38.919 --> 01:37:40.754
SUPPOSED PASSES THROUGH THIS

01:37:40.821 --> 01:37:42.890
COMMITTEE AND WE IMPLEMENTED IN

01:37:42.957 --> 01:37:45.292
THE STUDIES DO YOU GO THROUGH-

01:37:45.359 --> 01:37:46.860
ASIDE FROM THE FACT THAT THEY

01:37:46.927 --> 01:37:48.462
WOULD BE LIABLE TO LOCATION OR

01:37:48.529 --> 01:37:50.164
SOMEONE IS GET SICK WHICH AS A

01:37:50.231 --> 01:37:52.900
MOM I'M I'M ALL ABOUT PROTECTING

01:37:52.967 --> 01:37:54.902
YOUR KIDS. THERE'S NO POSSIBLE

01:37:54.969 --> 01:37:56.670
WAY THAT YOU COULD PROTECT OUR

01:37:56.737 --> 01:37:59.006
SCHOOL DISTRICTS FROM LITIGATION

01:37:59.073 --> 01:38:01.208
UNTIL THEY HAVE THE FUNDING

01:38:01.275 --> 01:38:03.043
PROVIDED I DON'T THINK THAT THIS

01:38:03.110 --> 01:38:05.546
BILL INCREASES THEIR- ASIAN

01:38:05.613 --> 01:38:07.948
EXPOSURE. THIS BILL IF ANYTHING

01:38:08.015 --> 01:38:10.651
REDUCES- BECAUSE THEY WILL KNOW

01:38:10.718 --> 01:38:12.586
OKAY WE HAVE ONE LETTER READ ON

01:38:12.653 --> 01:38:14.421
IN OUR WATER. AND SO WE DON'T

01:38:14.488 --> 01:38:16.156
WANT OUR KIDS TO DRINK THAT

01:38:16.223 --> 01:38:17.091
ANYMORE WE'RE GOING TO BRING AN

01:38:17.157 --> 01:38:18.425
EXTERNAL SOURCE OF WATER.

01:38:18.492 --> 01:38:19.393
INSTEAD OF THE DRINKING

01:38:19.460 --> 01:38:20.894
FOUNTAINS UNTIL WE CAN FIND A

01:38:20.961 --> 01:38:22.930
WAY TO REMEDIATE IT. THAT

01:38:22.997 --> 01:38:25.132
REDUCES THEIR LIABILITY I THINK

01:38:25.199 --> 01:38:26.900
JUST. FOR THIS FOR THEM NOT TO

01:38:26.967 --> 01:38:28.769
KNOW THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN A KID

01:38:28.836 --> 01:38:31.038

THAT THERE THAT THE WATER

01:38:38.646 --> 01:38:39.246
SYSTEMS CONTAMINATED THAT SEEMS

01:38:39.313 --> 01:38:39.947
LIKE A BIGGER HEADACHE

01:38:40.014 --> 01:38:41.081
LITIGATION WISE FOR SCHOOL

DOWN IF THERE'S A PROBLEM. THAT

01:38:48.922 --> 01:38:51.191

CURRICULUM TRANSPARENCY

01:43:01.275 --> 01:43:03.110

A CHILD'S EDUCATION THAT PARENTS

01:43:11.785 --> 01:43:13.353
BE INCLUDED. CLASSROOMS ARE

01:43:13.420 --> 01:43:14.221

DISCUSSIONS TAKE PLACE AND

01:43:15.656 --> 01:43:16.957
TEACHERS ARE THERE TO TEACH HER

01:43:17.024 --> 01:43:19.126
STUDENTS HOW TO THINK BUT NOT

01:43:19.192 --> 01:43:20.661
WHAT TO THINK. THE GOAL IS TO

01:43:20.727 --> 01:43:22.329
SHOW BOTH SIDES OF AN ISSUE AND

01:43:22.396 --> 01:43:24.231
HELP STUDENTS FORM THEIR OWN

01:43:24.298 --> 01:43:25.866
OPINIONS THIS IS HOW WE CREATE

01:43:25.933 --> 01:43:27.901
INSIGHTFUL YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN

01:43:27.968 --> 01:43:29.369
WHO ARE ABLE TO DISCERN BETWEEN

01:43:29.436 --> 01:43:31.271
SENSATIONALIZED NEWS AND THE

01:43:31.338 --> 01:43:33.173

IS BEING TAUGHT IN THE CLASSROOM

01:43:38.011 --> 01:43:39.246
AND PARENTS DO HAVE A RIGHT TO

01:43:39.313 --> 01:43:43.016
KNOW WHAT EXACTLY THEIR CHILDREN

01:43:43.083 --> 01:43:43.884

THE ASSIST GIVE THEM ANY IT'S

02:01:08.461 --> 02:01:10.830

OVERBURDENED TEACHERS WHO WANT

02:01:12.331 --> 02:01:13.899

02:01:29.615 --> 02:01:30.416
CASES IT PROVIDES NOR

02:01:30.483 --> 02:01:33.219
TRANSPARENCY BUT FEELS LIKE AN

02:01:33.285 --> 02:01:35.154
ATTEMPT TO CREATE A VERY BETWEEN

02:01:35.221 --> 02:01:36.088

LESSON PLANS TO PERRANCE SOMEHOW

02:09:26.859 --> 02:09:28.927
REDUCES THE POWER OF TEACHING BY

02:09:28.994 --> 02:09:30.829
RESTRICTING EDUCATORS TO TEACH

02:09:30.896 --> 02:09:32.998
THE BOOK AND FURTHER LEAD TO JOB

02:09:33.065 --> 02:09:36.301
DISSATISFACTION IN INCREASE THE

FOR PROVIDING THAT TO PARENTS.

02:09:48.213 --> 02:09:49.915

KNOW IT I CAN'T QUITE GET IN

02:10:31.056 --> 02:10:32.090
THERE IT DEPENDS ON THE TRAINING

02:10:32.157 --> 02:10:34.226
OF THE TEACHER BUT I CAN'T QUITE

02:10:34.293 --> 02:10:36.395
GET IN THERE TO SEE THE ACTUAL

02:10:36.461 --> 02:10:36.995
ASSIGNMENTS THOUGH I WAS FOR

02:10:37.062 --> 02:10:39.464
INSTANCE THE OTHER DAY I COULD

02:10:39.531 --> 02:10:40.065
PULL UP A QUOTE IS THAT THEY

02:10:40.132 --> 02:10:42.167
WERE GIVEN. I'M IN CLASS WHICH

02:10:42.234 --> 02:10:43.135
IS TEACHING THEM ABOUT A

02:10:43.202 --> 02:10:45.337
LITERACY PASSED THAT USED TO BE

02:10:45.404 --> 02:10:47.773

PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO VOTE AND

02:10:48.907 --> 02:10:51.043
THAT WAS. A GOOD FIND FOR ME

02:10:51.109 --> 02:10:52.311
BECAUSE THAT WAS SOMETHING WE

02:10:52.377 --> 02:10:53.478

EVER BUT NOT EVERY SCHOOL HAS

02:10:56.014 --> 02:10:57.683
THIS AND THIS IS WHAT PARENTS

02:10:57.749 --> 02:11:00.118
WANT THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO

02:11:00.185 --> 02:11:00.719

02:11:00.786 --> 02:11:02.187
ARE BEING DISCUSSED IN OUR

CLASSROOMS AND- AND WHAT IS

02:11:03.255 --> 02:11:04.990
BEING TAUGHT SO I JUST. WANTED

02:11:05.057 --> 02:11:08.060
TO POINT THAT OUT THAT- SOME

02:11:08.126 --> 02:11:09.628
SCHOOLS ARE ALREADY DOING THIS

02:11:09.695 --> 02:11:11.029
ACT FACT MANY SCHOOLS ARE

02:11:11.096 --> 02:11:12.764
ALREADY DOING THIS- AND

02:11:12.831 --> 02:11:13.732
CERTAINLY PARENTS WOULD

02:11:13.799 --> 02:11:16.602
APPRECIATED IF. IF ALL OF THE

02:11:16.668 --> 02:11:20.205

02:11:21.373 --> 02:11:23.008
FOR PARENTS TO BE A PARTNER WITH

02:11:23.075 --> 02:11:24.843
TEACHERS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO

02:11:24.910 --> 02:11:25.377
ENSURE CHILDREN RECEIVE A

02:11:36.755 --> 02:11:38.257
EXACTLY TRUE SAID GIVING PARENTS

02:11:38.323 --> 02:11:40.025

REQUIRE THEM TO SIT DOWN AND
