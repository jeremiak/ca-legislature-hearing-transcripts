PASSED ON THE CONDITION THE FILE

00:13:30.109 --> 00:13:32.344
. I HAVE GOT TO AND A MOVED TO

00:13:32.411 --> 00:13:34.446
COMMENT ON THE ACTIONS OF THE

00:13:34.513 --> 00:13:36.215
CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY

00:13:36.282 --> 00:13:38.250
TRUSTEES YESTERDAY. IN THE

00:13:38.317 --> 00:13:40.886
ARROGANT MANNER IN WHICH THEY

00:13:40.953 --> 00:13:44.990
RELIEVE CHANCELLOR JOE CASTRO.

00:13:45.057 --> 00:13:47.560
OF HIS RESPONSIBILITIES. THE

00:13:47.626 --> 00:13:50.996
DELEGATION AND ACCUSATIONS. THE

00:13:51.063 --> 00:13:52.531
PRESIDENT CASTRO WAS NEVER

00:13:52.598 --> 00:13:53.866
ALLOWED THE OPPORTUNITY TO

00:13:53.933 --> 00:13:56.936
REFUTE. WHATEVER'S AT HIS OWN

00:13:57.002 --> 00:13:59.138
SIDE OF THE STORY. AND THE

00:13:59.205 --> 00:14:01.106
TRUSTEES DID NOT ALLOW THAT

00:14:01.173 --> 00:14:03.809
YESTERDAY EITHER. IN FACT IN THE

00:14:03.876 --> 00:14:06.078
PROCESS THAT THEY HAVE HAD

00:14:06.145 --> 00:14:09.114
SUGGESTED TO HIM. THEY DEVIATED

00:14:09.181 --> 00:14:14.453
FROM. I WOULD ARGUE PURPOSELY.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.121
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE

00:14:16.188 --> 00:14:19.058
ANY INQUIRY. THEY WERE SUPPOSED

00:14:19.124 --> 00:14:22.361
TO BE AN INVESTIGATION. THE

00:14:22.428 --> 00:14:27.032
SITUATION. THE BOARD PROCEEDED

00:14:27.099 --> 00:14:32.538
THE INVESTIGATION. PROCEEDED.

00:14:32.605 --> 00:14:36.375
BASED ON ALLEGATIONS. I BELIEVE

00:14:36.442 --> 00:14:39.011
THAT THERE WERE FALSE ONES. AND

00:14:39.078 --> 00:14:41.347
I'VE KNOWN THE MAN FOR DECADES.

00:14:41.413 --> 00:14:43.082
HE CAME UP THROUGH THE RANKS THE

00:14:43.148 --> 00:14:46.986
CSU. BECAME A KIND OF A

00:14:47.052 --> 00:14:48.621
BREAKTHROUGH PIONEER WHERE THE

00:14:48.687 --> 00:14:51.423
CSU FOR YEARS WAS TRYING TO FIND

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:54.026
ITS PRESIDENTS AND- NATIONWIDE

00:14:54.093 --> 00:14:55.661
SEARCHES. INSTEAD OF LOOKING

00:14:55.728 --> 00:15:04.203
WITHIN AND LIFTING UP THEIR OWN. JOE CASTRO IS ONE OF THE FIRST

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:05.204
. LUCIEN CAME UP THROUGH THE

00:15:05.271 --> 00:15:07.339
RANKS. WHAT MESSAGE IS THAT

00:15:07.406 --> 00:15:10.843
TRUSTEES. TO THE PEOPLE WHO WORK

00:15:10.909 --> 00:15:13.746
FOR CSU. THE MESSAGES YOUR

00:15:13.812 --> 00:15:16.982
BACKUP. YOU'LL DO WHATEVER YOU

00:15:17.049 --> 00:15:18.784
DEEM POLITICALLY CORRECT INNER

00:15:18.851 --> 00:15:21.086
REGULARLY SO AND TRY TO INSULATE

00:15:21.153 --> 00:15:24.456
YOURSELF FROM AN INNING IN FOUR

00:15:24.523 --> 00:15:26.325
IS A CRITICISM OF YOU. WELL

00:15:26.392 --> 00:15:29.628
TRUSTEES I AM ENQUIRING ABOUT.

00:15:29.695 --> 00:15:33.098
I'M GOING TO SUBMIT A REQUEST.

00:15:33.165 --> 00:15:36.869
FOR INFORMATION. ABOUT SOME OF

00:15:36.935 --> 00:15:39.571
YOUR INTERNAL PROCEDURES. AND

00:15:39.638 --> 00:15:42.708
COMMUNICATIONS THAT CIRCULATED

00:15:42.775 --> 00:15:45.611
RIGHT BEFORE THE SECTION OF

00:15:45.678 --> 00:15:48.380
YESTERDAY BETWEEN THE TRUSTEES

00:15:48.447 --> 00:15:52.785
EACH OTHER AND OTHER PARTIES.

00:15:52.851 --> 00:15:55.120
TRULY IT'S A DISGRACE. THIS IS

00:15:55.187 --> 00:15:58.891
AN OUTRAGE. AND THEY'VE TRIED TO

00:15:58.957 --> 00:16:01.660
DESTROY THE CAREER. A LIFETIME

00:16:01.727 --> 00:16:04.029
OF SERVICE TO OUR STUDENTS. JOE

00:16:09.368 --> 00:16:12.371
OF UNFAVORABLE LIGHT THE ENTIRE

00:16:12.438 --> 00:16:15.307
CSU SYSTEM. AND I HOPE THE

00:16:15.374 --> 00:16:17.976
LEADERSHIP IN THE AREA. THAT

00:16:18.043 --> 00:16:19.678
INCLUDES THE UNIVERSITY

00:16:19.745 --> 00:16:24.550
PRESIDENT. INDIRECT RYAN FILE.

00:16:24.616 --> 00:16:27.086
LET THEIR CONCERNS BE KNOWN AS A

00:16:27.152 --> 00:16:29.254
SIGN. MAYBE THESE TRUSTEES WILL

00:16:29.321 --> 00:16:32.958
GET IT. OR MAYBE THEY'LL

00:16:33.025 --> 00:16:35.194
GRACIOUSLY HELPED US ALL BY

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:39.198
LEAVING OFFICE. IN OUR BORDERS

00:16:39.264 --> 00:16:42.534
FOR WHAT PURPOSE. THIS PRESIDENT

00:16:42.601 --> 00:16:45.170
TO CONDITION THE FILE PLEASE.

00:16:45.237 --> 00:16:47.706
WITHOUT OBJECTION THANK YOU I

00:16:47.773 --> 00:16:48.273
THINK MY COLLEAGUE FROM TO

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:50.109
HAMMER US AT A NUMBER OF

00:16:50.175 --> 00:16:52.144
IMPORTANT POINTS I WON'T BELABOR

00:16:52.211 --> 00:16:55.647
THEM FURTHER. I JUST THINK IT'S

00:16:55.714 --> 00:16:57.750
A MATTER OF DUE PROCESS. THAT

00:16:57.816 --> 00:16:58.684
ALL OF US SHOULD BE CONCERNED

00:16:58.751 --> 00:17:00.452
ABOUT HOW THIS MATTER WAS

00:17:00.519 --> 00:17:02.755
HANDLED AND WHAT I MEAN BY DUE

00:17:02.821 --> 00:17:05.724
PROCESS. IS THAT IF SOMEBODY IS

00:17:05.791 --> 00:17:07.126
ACCUSED OF MISHANDLING OF

00:17:07.192 --> 00:17:09.695
MATTERS. IN THERE ARE ENTITIES

00:17:09.762 --> 00:17:11.096
INVOLVED IN THAT PROCESS

00:17:11.163 --> 00:17:13.332
ESPECIALLY INSTITUTION TEAM THIS

00:17:13.399 --> 00:17:14.533
THIS ISSUE SYSTEM. THAT

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:18.337
INDIVIDUAL ON BE AFFORDED A

00:17:18.404 --> 00:17:21.273
CERTAIN PRESUMPTIONS UNTIL AN

00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:24.309
INVESTIGATION YIELDS A RESULT.

00:17:24.376 --> 00:17:26.612
WHAT I'M SEEING RIGHT NOW IS A

00:17:26.678 --> 00:17:30.783
PRESUMPTION OF GUILT WITHOUT

00:17:30.849 --> 00:17:33.085
HAVING ALREADY CONDUCTED AN

00:17:33.152 --> 00:17:35.421
INTERNAL INVESTIGATION. NO I'M

00:17:35.487 --> 00:17:36.522
NOT GOING TO SAY WHETHER OR NOT

00:17:36.588 --> 00:17:37.856
THE INDIVIDUAL SHOULD HAVE

00:17:37.923 --> 00:17:39.591
MERITED DISMISSAL AT SOME POINT

00:17:39.658 --> 00:17:41.593
IN TIME. OR WHETHER HE SHOULD

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.695
HAVE STAYED BECAUSE HE WOULD

00:17:43.762 --> 00:17:45.431
HAVE BEEN- ARE FOUND TO HAVE.

00:17:45.497 --> 00:17:47.933
ACTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.868
PROCEDURES AND EXPECTATIONS. BUT

00:17:49.935 --> 00:17:52.438
I WOULD EXPECT AN INSTITUTION OF

00:17:52.504 --> 00:17:53.906
HIGHER LEARNING BEING LED BY A

00:17:53.972 --> 00:17:55.674
BOARD OF TRUSTEES WOULD HAVE

00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:57.876
ALTERED THE NOTION. OF DUE

00:17:57.943 --> 00:18:00.646
PROCESS. AND IF THAT WASN'T

00:18:00.712 --> 00:18:03.215
AFFORDED THAT I THINK WE ARE

00:18:03.282 --> 00:18:04.683
BEING HYPOCRITICAL OF WHAT WE

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:06.819
EXPECT OUR STUDENTS TO LEARN IN

00:18:06.885 --> 00:18:10.722
OUR SYSTEM. ALL IN MY COMMENTS

00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:13.225
HERE FOLKS. ONCE AGAIN IT'S NOT

00:18:13.292 --> 00:18:14.560
WHETHER OR NOT THE INDIVIDUAL

00:18:14.626 --> 00:18:17.129
MERITED A REPRIMAND TO DISMISSAL

00:18:17.196 --> 00:18:20.299
OR AN ACQUITTAL. BUT I GUARANTEE

00:18:20.365 --> 00:18:23.969
THAT. OUTCOME THAT OCCURRED WITH

00:18:24.036 --> 00:18:25.304
THAT FORMER FRESNO STATE

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:28.173
EMPLOYEE. HOW DO WOMEN SIGNED

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.642
OFF BY OTHER INDIVIDUALS WITHIN

00:18:30.709 --> 00:18:33.545
THE CSU SYSTEM. SO IT KIND OF

00:18:33.612 --> 00:18:35.647
BEGS THE QUESTION IF THERE WERE

00:18:35.714 --> 00:18:37.850
INTERNAL PROCESSES THE PLAY THAT

00:18:37.916 --> 00:18:39.151
HAD TO HAVE BEEN GREEN LIGHTED

00:18:39.218 --> 00:18:41.420
BY INDIVIDUALS ON THE BOARD OR

00:18:41.487 --> 00:18:45.057
WITHIN STAFF. IT FURTHER BEGS

00:18:45.123 --> 00:18:47.025
THE POINT THAT INDIVIDUAL SHOULD

00:18:47.092 --> 00:18:49.995
BE AFFORDED DUE PROCESS AND FROM

00:18:50.062 --> 00:18:51.163
WHAT I CAN TELL THAT DID NOT

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:55.267
OCCUR HERE. JENNER COVER YOUR-

00:18:55.334 --> 00:18:59.271
