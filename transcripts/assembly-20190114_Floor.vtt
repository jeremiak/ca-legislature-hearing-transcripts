IN A SERVICE TO COMMUNITY.

01:31:36.757 --> 01:31:38.793
BUT HE WAS A SELFLESS AND

01:31:38.860 --> 01:31:41.329
TIRELESS OF FIGHTER FOR EQUAL

01:31:41.395 --> 01:31:43.364
OPPORTUNITY AND JUSTICE IN

PERSONS I'VE MET WAS OBVIOUS

01:31:50.171 --> 01:31:50.338

01:31:50.404 --> 01:31:51.038
I HAD NO IDEA WHO HE WAS BUT HE

01:31:51.105 --> 01:31:52.807
MADE SURE THAT EVERY MEMBER OF

01:31:52.874 --> 01:31:54.742
THE BLACK CAUCUS KNEW WHO HE WAS.

01:31:54.809 --> 01:31:56.077
AND UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF

01:31:56.143 --> 01:31:57.211
HIS MISSION WHICH WAS TO

01:31:57.278 --> 01:31:58.479
BASICALLY PROMOTE BLACK

01:31:58.546 --> 01:32:00.481
BUSINESSES AND BLACK ENTERPRISE

01:32:00.548 --> 01:32:01.749
IN THE ENGAGEMENT OF

01:32:01.816 --> 01:32:03.618
CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY IN THE

01:32:03.684 --> 01:32:04.919
BLACK COMMUNITY.

01:32:04.986 --> 01:32:06.387
AND SO I WAS HONORED TO KNOW HIM

01:32:06.454 --> 01:32:08.122
AND TO SEE A PERSON WHO REALLY

01:32:08.189 --> 01:32:09.724
WAS VERY PASSIONATE.

01:32:09.790 --> 01:32:11.225
AND CONCERN IN A VERY SELFLESS

01:32:11.292 --> 01:32:15.763
WAY AUBREY STONE NEVER PROMOTING

01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:17.131
SOME BUSINESS THAT HE OWNS BUT

01:32:17.198 --> 01:32:18.633
REALLY PROMOTING THE INCLUSION

01:32:18.699 --> 01:32:20.701
OF AFRICAN AMERICANS IN THE

01:32:20.768 --> 01:32:22.370
BUSINESS LIFE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:32:22.436 --> 01:32:23.771
AND HE DID IT EVERYWHERE IN

01:32:23.838 --> 01:32:25.239
CALIFORNIA HE DID IT DID NOT

01:32:25.306 --> 01:32:27.942
ONLY IN SACRAMENTO BUT IN SANDY

01:32:28.009 --> 01:32:29.877
A GO HE DID IT THE WAY PACKED HE

01:32:29.944 --> 01:32:30.845
DID IT TO VARIOUS KINDS OF

01:32:30.912 --> 01:32:31.078
THINGS.

01:32:31.145 --> 01:32:32.246
AND SUPPORT OF VARIOUS PIECES OF

01:32:32.313 --> 01:32:33.948
LEGISLATION HE WAS ALWAYS THERE

01:32:34.015 --> 01:32:36.117
IS A VOICE HIS CONFERENCES OF

01:32:36.183 --> 01:32:36.918
THROUGHOUT THE STATE WILL WELL

01:32:36.984 --> 01:32:37.852
ATTENDED.

01:32:37.919 --> 01:32:39.520
AND SO HE KEPT THE CONCEPT OF

01:32:39.587 --> 01:32:41.389
BLACK BUSINESSES ON THE MINDS OF

01:32:41.455 --> 01:32:42.456
LEGISLATORS.

01:32:42.523 --> 01:32:44.258
EVERYWHERE IN CALIFORNIA AND WE

01:32:44.325 --> 01:32:45.927
WERE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT.

01:32:45.993 --> 01:32:47.695
IT'S QUICK TO YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S

01:32:47.762 --> 01:32:49.230
DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE

01:32:49.297 --> 01:32:51.766
CALIFORNIA'S BLACK BUSINESS

01:32:51.832 --> 01:32:52.767
VOICE WITHOUT ARBOR STONE.

01:32:52.833 --> 01:32:54.435
BECAUSE THERE WERE VERY FEW

01:32:54.502 --> 01:32:55.870
PEOPLE WHO CARRY THAT MESSAGE.

01:32:55.937 --> 01:32:58.239
CONSISTENTLY AS HE DID WITHOUT

01:32:58.306 --> 01:33:00.541
AN INTEREST IN HIS OWN PERSONAL

01:33:00.608 --> 01:33:02.076
PROMOTION BUT REALLY IN A

01:33:02.143 --> 01:33:03.744
PROMOTION OF BLACK BUSINESSES

01:33:03.811 --> 01:33:04.812
ITSELF.

01:33:04.879 --> 01:33:06.447
HE WAS A LEADER IN OUR CHAMBER

01:33:06.514 --> 01:33:07.381
MOVEMENT HE ESTABLISHED THE

01:33:07.448 --> 01:33:08.683
BLACK CHAMBER BUT HE WAS A

01:33:08.749 --> 01:33:10.418
LEADER IN THAT WITH ALL OF THE

01:33:10.484 --> 01:33:11.352
OTHER ENTITIES THROUGHOUT THE

01:33:11.419 --> 01:33:13.120
STATE NEVER TRYING TO TAKE OVER

01:33:13.187 --> 01:33:14.722
ANY PARTICULAR.

01:33:14.789 --> 01:33:16.023
INDIVIDUAL CHAMBER WHERE THERE

01:33:16.090 --> 01:33:17.625
WAS A SAN DIEGO BLACK CHAMBER OR

01:33:17.692 --> 01:33:19.460
SOMEONE ELSE BUT REALLY TRYING

01:33:19.527 --> 01:33:20.428
TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE CHAMBERS

01:33:20.494 --> 01:33:21.662
HAVE THE SUPPORT.

01:33:21.729 --> 01:33:23.698
OF A STATEWIDE NETWORK THAT

01:33:23.764 --> 01:33:24.799
WOULD HELP THEM TO GROW AND TO

01:33:24.865 --> 01:33:26.233
DEVELOP.

01:33:26.300 --> 01:33:27.902
AND SO WE'VE MISSED ARBOR STONE

01:33:27.969 --> 01:33:29.637

01:33:29.704 --> 01:33:31.372
INTERESTING OF HIS CONTACT.

01:33:31.439 --> 01:33:32.306
AND HIS PRESENCE IN THE

01:33:32.373 --> 01:33:33.874
SACRAMENTO COMMUNITY IN THE

01:33:33.941 --> 01:33:36.610
STATE COMMUNITY WAS SO IMPORTANT

01:33:36.677 --> 01:33:38.279

LEGISLATIVE INDIVIDUALS KNEW HIM

01:33:40.715 --> 01:33:42.483
AND ALL THE AGENCIES KNEW HIM.

01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:47.121
IT WAS KIND OF HILARIOUS IN THE

01:33:47.188 --> 01:33:50.992
