I LIKE TO SHARE ONE OF MY FAVORITE STORIES ABOUT THE WELL KNOWN MOM SHE NINE WHO LIVED EIGHT HUNDRED YEARS AGO IN JAPAN. SHE NINE EMBODIED THE VIRTUES OF UNDENIABLE HONESTY AND HUMILITY. ALTHOUGH CONSIDERED ACCOMPLISHED BY HIS TEACHER MASTER WHEN AND DEEP WITHIN. SHE NINE WAS CONFUSED. IN PERSONAL DESPAIR. HE WENT TO HONE IN AND ASKED HIS TEACHER. WHAT SHALL I DO WITH MY LIFE? OPPONENTS RESPONSE WAS ONE THAT HAS QUIETLY GUIDED MY LIFE FOR ALMOST FIFTEEN YEARS. ONE IN REPLY DISHING NONE. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO DO. IS TO LIVE YOUR LIFE WITH KINDNESS AND GRATITUDE. HE WENT ON TO ADD. IF YOU CAN'T LIVE SUCH A LIFE IS A MONK DO IT AS A LAYMAN. IF YOU CAN'T LIVE IT AS A LAYMAN DO IT AS A MONK. IF YOU CAN'T LIVE THE LIFE OF GRATITUDE ALONE. THEN DO IT WITH PEOPLE. IF YOU CAN DO IT WITH PEOPLE. LIVE SUCH A LIFE ALONE. IF YOU CAN STAY IN ONE PLACE LIVING WITH KINDNESS THEN MOVE AROUND INTO IT. IF YOU CAN DO IT MOVING AROUND DIDN'T STAY IN ONE PLACE. BUT MOST IMPORTANT AND MOST ESSENTIAL. IS TO SIMPLY LIVE YOUR LIFE WITH CHIU KINDNESS AND GRATITUDE. SHE NOW KNEW THAT DEEP WITHIN. HIS NATURE WAS IN CONFLICT WITH THE PATH OF TRADITION. HOWEVER HIS TEACHER HONAN HAD THE CONFIDENCE TO TRUST HIM TO RESPOND HONESTLY TO HIS OWN TRUE NATURE. HOLDEN WAS INTERESTING SHE NON DEFINED HIS OWN PATH. SINGLE PATH TO FULFILLMENT. SHE NOTS LIFE OF KINDNESS AND GRATITUDE. NATURALLY GREW FROM HAVING HIS LIFE GENUINELY FULFILLED. WHEN THERE'D BEEN TIMES OF CONFUSION IN MY LIFE? THIS STORY HAS COME TO MIND. AND I'VE BEEN ME TO REMEMBER AGAIN. THAT WE MUST FIND THE COURAGE TO BE OUR CHIU SELVES. AND FROM OUR GENUINE FULFILMENT. A LIFE OF KINDNESS INGRATITUDE WILL FLOW.

THIS MEASURE REFLECTS THE COURAGE UPON THOSE THAT FLED THE COMPASSION TO THOSE TAKES THE MEN AND REAFFIRMS OUR OUR BIPARTISAN COMMITMENT TO HELP. THE MILLIONS OF REFUGEES OR DISPLACED -- ACROSS THE GLOBE THROUGH WAR AND PERSECUTION. PLEASE JOIN ME IN SUPPORTING HR NINETY ONE RECOGNIZING JUNE TWENTIETH IS WORLD REFUGEE DAY. AND I ASKED THE FIRST ROLE BE OPEN TO CO AUTHORS MADE A FEW THANK YOU MR MCCARTY MS CARILLO. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS TODAY I RISE ON BEHALF OF THE LATINO CAUCUS IN SUPPORT OF HR. NINETY ONE IN THE MILLIONS OF DISPLACED PEOPLES OF THE WORLD TO SEEK SAFETY AND A BETTER LIFE. S. THIS RESOLUTION NOTES CHILDREN ACCOUNT 451% OF THE REFUGEE POPULATION IN THE WORLD. WHICH IS WELL OVER SIXTY FIVE MILLION PEOPLE. CALIFORNIA AND AMERICANS ACROSS THIS NATION. ARE VERY CONCERNED OVER THE CURRENT HEARTLESS POLICY OF THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION. IN THE SEPARATION OF CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS WHEN THEY COME TO THE U. S. SEEKING REFUGE SEEKING ASYLUM. THE REFUGEE CRISIS DOES NOT EXIST OUTSIDE OF THESE BORDERS. IN IS NOT ONLY SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS IN OTHER PLACES ALL OVER THE WORLD. IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT HERE. FROM THE MEDITERRANEAN CRISIS WHERE PEOPLE ARE DYING EVERY SINGLE DAY IN THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA. TO OVER TWO THOUSAND CHILDREN. THAT HAVE BEEN SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENTS RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE OF OUR ADMINISTRATION'S POLICIES. THESE ARE CHILDREN WHO WERE LIVING IN CAGES WHO ARE REFUGEES TO THIS NATION. WHO ARE NOT ALLOWED TO BE COUNSEL FOR SOLD WHO HAVE BEEN SEPARATED FROM THE ONLY FAMILY THAT THEY'VE EVER KNOWN. THIS IS A REFUGEE [inaudible] DAY. IN WE HAVE A CRISIS ON OUR HANDS. AND HOW WE RESPOND AS AMERICANS. HOW WE RESPOND AS THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY? SAYS A LOT ABOUT OUR VALUES. I'M SUPPORTING THIS RESOLUTION AND I THINK ALL OF US SHOULD. BECAUSE THIS IS AN INTOLERABLE PRACTICE. SEPARATING CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS IS NOT ONLY CRUEL BUT IS INHUMANE. IT IS AN ABUSE TO CHILDREN. IT IS ALSO ACCORDING TO THE UNITED NATIONS. A SEVERE VIOLATION TO CHILDREN'S RIGHTS AND INTERNATIONAL LAW. FAMILIES ARE SEEKING ASYLUM FROM COUNTRIES THAT ARE WORN TORN AND FILLED WITH VIOLENCE. WE MUST TAKE THE STEPS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS WHO ARE LEFT WITH NO CHOICE BUT TO RISK THEIR LIVES. IN SEARCH OF A BETTER OPPORTUNITY [inaudible] HOW THAT? IN THIS COUNTRY. I'VE SHARED MY STORY OVER AND OVER WITH MANY OF YOU PERSONALLY AND ON THIS FLOOR [inaudible] I MYSELF. I'M AN UNRECOGNIZED REFUGEE FROM A COUNTRY FILLED WITH VIOLENCE AND WAR. AND I'LL GET TO SIT HERE AND SAY THESE WORDS [inaudible] AND NO. BUT THERE ARE [inaudible] THOUSANDS. A LITTLE BOYS AND GIRLS UNDER THE AGE OF FIVE WERE LIVING IN CAGES AT THIS MOMENT. IT IS NOT A FOREIGN CONCEPT. THE SOMETHING THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW [inaudible] RIGHT HERE. IN OUR HOME. IN OUR OWN COUNTRY [inaudible] SO PLEASE. I ASKED THAT YOU LOOK DEEP INTO YOUR HEART. RECOGNIZED THAT THIS IS MORE THAN JUST A RESOLUTION. AND THAT WE MUST DO SOMETHING. TO ENSURE THAT THIS COUNTRY AS ONE OF OPPORTUNITY EQUITY AND JUSTICE FOR EVERYONE. THE GROUND THE SOIL AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUESTING MY VOTE THINK YOU. THANK YOU MISS KOREA MISS GONZALEZFLETCHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THINK ILL I HAVE RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION I WANT THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD IT WAS THAT TIMING THAT STRUCK TODAY AS WORLD REFUGEE DAY. I'M BUT I REPRESENT THAT COMMUNITIES CITY HEIGHTS WHICH IS ONE OF THE LARGEST REFUGEE COMMUNITIES AND IN CALIFORNIA AND IN OUR NATION. I'M. BUT IT'S POIGNANT THAT COMES TODAY. BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMIND FOLKS THAT WHAT IS HAPPENING AT OUR BORDERS. IS HAPPENING [inaudible] TO REFUGEES. AND WHAT IS HAPPENING WHEN PEOPLE COME TO THIS COUNTRY IN PRESENT THEMSELVES FOR ASYLUM THAT IS A LEGAL IMMIGRATION. THAT IS WHAT OUR LAW ALLOWS THEM TO COME WITH THEIR FAMILY AND PRESENT THEMSELVES INTO ARGUE FOR REFUGEE STATUS IT'S HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTRY AND AS THEY DO WITH THEIR CHILDREN ARE BEING RIPPED FROM THEM. AND BEING PUT IN CAGES. AND THE PEOPLE REPEAT. THESE CHILDREN AWAY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO EVEN HUG THEM WHEN THEY'RE CRYING CAN YOU IMAGINE IN AN INSTITUTION TWO YEAR OLD CHILDREN CRYING THEMSELVES TO SLEEP WITHOUT EVEN BEING HUGGED BECAUSE THESE ARE NOT MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS. THIS IS HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTRY TODAY. IT IS NOT A LAW THAT WAS PASSED THIS IS A NEW. IT IS WRONG IN ON WORLD REFUGEE DAY IF WE CANNOT ALL EXPRESSED OUTRAGE. ABOUT THE WAY THAT OUR COUNTRY IS TREATING FAMILIES AND CHILDREN. BUT SPECIFICALLY. BECAUSE I NEVER WANT TO JUST HEAR SOMEBODY BROKE THE LAW I THINK THAT'S IT. IRRELEVANT DISCUSSION ANYWAY BUT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REFUGEES IN THOSE SEEKING ASYLUM THEY DIDN'T BREAK THE LAW. THE IN FACT WINS BY OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS THEY ARE LEGAL IMMIGRANTS AND TOLD THEY ARE DEFINED AS REFUGEES ARE NOT. JUST WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT TODAY BECAUSE THERE'S NO BETTER DAY THAN TO CELEBRATE WORLD REFUGEE DAY. AS SO MANY OF THESE CHILD REFUGEES ARE LEFT ALONE IN CAGES THROUGHOUT OUR COUNTRY ON THIS VERY DAY RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NIGHT VOTE. MR MEDINA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER BUT I THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO FOR BRINGING THIS. RESOLUTION FORWARD. AND I WILL ECHO MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO. ABOUT THIS DAY BRINGING THIS RESOLUTION FORWARD -- YESTERDAY. I LIKE MANY OF YOU HERE. FATHERS SPENT THE DAY WITH MY SON. AND WE SPENT THE SUN CELEBRATING FATHER'S DAY. YESTERDAY IN LOS ANGELES SOMETHING THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT TO ME. THAN MY OWN TWO CHILDREN. AND AS I CELEBRATED FATHER'S DAY YESTERDAY I DID THINK. EARLY IN THE MORNING I WATCHED THE MORNING NEWS PROGRAMS. AND I THOUGHT ABOUT THESE CHILDREN. ON OUR BORDER. HOW THEY ARE BEING SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENTS AND I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT AS I CELEBRATED FATHER'S DAY? SO I'M VERY THANKFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO SPEAK ON THIS RESOLUTION. AND TO REMIND US THAT THE UNITED NATIONS HAS SAID THAT THE PRACTICE OF SEPARATING CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS IS A HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATION. AND I COULD NOT SIT HERE THIS MORNING. WITHOUT RISING. SPEAK AGAINST THE PRACTICE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO SEPARATE CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS SO I ENCOURAGED ALL OF US. TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST IT AND TO VOTE ON THIS RESOLUTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR MEDINA DOCTOR EGGMAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOUR SPEAKER I RISE ON BEHALF OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS TO ALSO GIVE OUR STRONG SUPPORT TO HR. NINETY ONE AND WE KNOW REACHED WORLD REFUGEE DAY AND WE'VE TALKED A LOT IN THIS BUILDING IN AND ALL OVER THE PLACE THAT WE CAN BE COMPETITIVE IN THE GLOBAL ISSUES. BUT WE HAVE EXAMPLES OF IT HAPPENING RIGHT HERE IN OUR COUNTRY IT BRINGS IT SO MUCH CLOSER TO HOME. WE KNOW IN THE LAST SIX WEEKS OVER TWO THOUSAND CHILDREN HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM THEIR PARENTS. AS A CROSS IN THIS COUNTRY. SOME WHO WORK IN THE PROFESSION OF SOCIAL WORK FOR LAST TIME I CAN TELL YOU ONE OF OUR NUMBER ONE POLICIES IN THE U. S.. IT'S NOT SEPARATE CHILDREN FROM FAMILIES. EVEN SITUATIONS SOMETIMES FROM ABUSE SOMETIMES NEGLECT WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO KEEP FAMILIES TOGETHER BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. FOR THAT FAMILY UNIT AS WELL AS FOR THOSE CHILDREN THEIR STABILITY. SO AS WE TALK ABOUT THE POLICY TO DEVELOP IN THIS COUNTRY AND THAT WE SEE. THE ANATHEMA OF THOSE POLICIES BEING ENACTED AT OUR BORDERS. WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING BUT RAISE OUR VOICES. IN DISBELIEF THAT THIS IS HAPPENING AND IN STRONG ENCOURAGEMENT THAT THIS PRACTICE COMES TO AN END. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON HR. NINETY ONE THANK YOU DOCTOR EGGMAN. IT'S QUIRK SILVA. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS MEMBERS I RISE AS A MOTHER TODAY. AS AN EDUCATOR AND AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF ORANGE COUNTY. AND AS I SEE NOT ONLY THE PHOTOS OF THESE YOUNG CHILDREN CRYING PARENTS HANDCUFFED. WHEN I THINK OF THOSE IN JUST THOSE THREE HATS AS A MOTHER A LEGISLATOR AND AS AN EDUCATOR? THIS POLICY IS ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS. IT IS SOMETHING THAT FOR MANY MANY DECADES THESE FAMILIES WILL LIVE WITH WHEN YOU UNDERSTAND THE LOVE OF A PARENT AND NOT EVEN KNOWING WHERE YOUR CHILD MIGHT BE. WHICH HOME THERE AT WHEN THEY MIGHT SEE THEM AGAIN THIS IS DAMAGE THAT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO REPAIR AND THIS POLICY IS NOT ACCURATE I'VE HEARD EVERYTHING FROM A BIBLE VERSE. TWO WE REALLY HAVEN'T CHANGED THE LAW THIS IS NOT THE AMERICA WE LOVE AND SO I URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS RESOLUTION. I THINK IT WAS QUIRK SILVA MISTER LEVINE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I THINK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AYE AYE AYE ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT OF HR NINETY ONE AND REFLECT AS WELL AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM RIVERSIDE DID ON HOW I SPENT MY FATHER'S DAY.

ADDRESSING THIS VERY SAME ISSUE. AND I'M LOOK GRATEFUL NOW CONGRESS IS PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS THAT THE MEDIA IS NOW PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS. WE OFTEN SAY THAT THIS TYPE OF ACT SEPARATING CHILDREN FROM PARENTS THE WAY THAT WE'RE TREATING. IMMIGRANTS FLEEING HORRIBLE. ATROCITIES IN SITUATIONS IN THEIR HOME COUNTRIES THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS ON AMERICAN BUT UNFORTUNATELY. IT ALL TOO OFTEN IS WHAT HAS BECOME AN AMERICAN RESPONSE OVER GENERATIONS I GOING ALL THE WAY BACK -- TO LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT A COUPLE OF INSTANCES IN WORLD WAR TWO WHERE IF YOU'RE AN AMERICAN THE PRODUCT OF JAPANESE DESCENT. THAT. YOU WERE TAKEN AND AND PUT INTO INTERNMENT CAMPS THAT. WHEN REFUGEES WERE FLEEING THE HELL THAT EUROPE BECAME? AYE DURING WORLD WAR TWO DURING THE HOLOCAUST AND THE ST LOUIS CAME. FROM YOUR UP TO OUR SHORES. THAT UNITED STATES TURNED THE BOAT AWAY [inaudible] SENDING HALF. OF THE PEOPLE ON THAT BOAT TO THEIR DEATHS. IN THE HOLOCAUST [inaudible] THAT. WE ARE SPEAKING OUT NOW ALMOST FEELING POWERLESS. TO WHAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS DOING. AND WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE. THE WAY THAT OUR COUNTRY IS PERCEIVED. AND THE WAY THAT WE TREAT PEOPLE. AND THAT OF WE HAVE REFUGEES COMING OVER OUR BORDER THAT WE SHOULD OPEN UP OUR DOORS THROW OPEN THE TENT. WELCOME THEM IN. FIND OUT FROM WHERE THEY'RE COMING. AND FROM WHAT THEY'RE ESCAPING. AND FIND A WAY THAT WE CAN HELP THEM. THAT IS WHAT. WE SHOULD ASPIRE. TO AS UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THEY WISH LEVINE MS BAKER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS. GIVE ME YOUR TIRED YOUR POOR YOUR HUDDLED MASSES YEARNING TO BREATHE FREE. IT IS PART OF OUR HERITAGE TO WELCOME THOSE FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD TO COME FROM MUCH LESS FORTUNATE. CONDITIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE HAVE HERE AND I DON'T RISE AS A MEMBER OF ANY PARTICULAR ONE CAUCUS BUT JUST AS SOMEONE WHO RECOGNIZES THAT YEARNING TO BREATHE FREE. AND SOMEONE WHO IS A MOTHER. ANY PARENT IN THIS ROOM IN THIS COUNTRY WE DO ANYTHING THEY COULD POSSIBLY DO TO GET THEIR CHILDREN TO BETTER OPPORTUNITY AND FREEDOM. WE LIVE IN THE COUNTRY WHERE THAT IS POSSIBLE [inaudible] AND IT IS PART OF OUR HERITAGE. TO WELCOME REFUGEES. AND TO SET UP A SYSTEM WHERE THEY CAN LEGALLY CLAIM ASYLUM AND COME TO THIS COUNTRY AND WHEN THEY DO. THEY CONTRIBUTE AMAZING THINGS. TWO YEARS AGO. I GAVE A RESOLUTION TO A WOMAN OF THE YEAR AND I SPOKE ABOUT IT ON THIS FOOR. SHE WAS A REFUGEE FROM CAMBODIA. WHO CAME HERE AFTER BARELY SURVIVING THE KILLING FIELDS? SEEN HER UNCLE SHOT IN FRONT OF HER. AND COMING HERE WITH NOTHING. AND SHE BECAME ONE OF THE MOST CELEBRATED MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY IN LAFAYETTE. AND WAS RECOGNIZED FOR HER GENEROSITY HER HARD WORKER GIVING HER CONTRIBUTION TO OUR COUNTRY SHE WANTED TO COME HERE. AND WE HAVE A PROCESS THROUGH WHICH FOLKS CAN DO THAT. I WISH IT WERE EVEN MORE OPEN. BUT NOBODY SHOULD SAY THAT IF YOU WERE A APPARENT REVIEW WARRANT YOU WOULDN'T DO EVERYTHING YOU POSSIBLY COULD. GET TO THIS COUNTRY. AND WE SHOULD MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO COME AND SUCCEED AND BECOME PART OF AMERICA. AND THEY ALL SPEAK DIFFERENT LANGUAGES. BUT THEY SPEAK A UNIFYING LANGUAGE THAT WE ALL KNOW AND THAT IS A YEARNING FOR FREEDOM THROUGH IT AT A CHANCE TO HAVE A BETTER LIFE AND WE HAVE IT HERE IN OUR COUNTRY WE SHOULD WELCOME IT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU IS BIGGER. MISLIM. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS AS A FORMER EDUCATOR I THINK BACK TO HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO KEEP STUDENTS AND FAMILIES. BUT AS SOMEONE WHO HAS ALSO WALKED IN A MALL AND SEEN A CHILD WHO HAS LOST WHO S. PANIC IN THEIR EYES WHO IS CRANE. I KNOW THAT THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS TO REUNITE THEM WITH THEIR FAMILY. I CANNOT EVEN BEGIN TO IMAGINE. WHAT? CHILDREN YOUNG ADULTS ARE FEELING AT THIS MOMENT WHO HAVE BEEN INTENTIONALLY SEPARATED FROM THEIR FAMILIES. THIS RESOLUTION THERE'S NO FLAWS. NO APPLAUSE DURING DEBATE. IN THE CHAMBER MISLIM ON YOU MAY CONTINUE. THIS RESOLUTION IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER. BECAUSE SO MANY IN OUR COMMUNITIES ARE WITNESSING WHAT IT FEELS LIKE. TO BE SCARED THE PANIC. TO SEE KIDS SEPARATED FROM THE INDIVIDUALS THAT MOST MATTER IN THEIR LIVES. THERE ARE NO SHORT TERM OR LONG TERMS GAME. WE ALL LOSE THEIR FAMILIES LOSE THE KIDS LOSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THINK MS ABOLISHED THURMAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. COLLEAGUES ARE RISING SUPPORT OF HR. NINETY ONE AND I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. I URGE YOU TO DO MORE THAN VOTE. WE MUST DO MORE. THEN VOTE. ON RESOLUTIONS ON THIS FLOOR WE MUST. LIFT UP OUR VOICE. TO THE WORLD. TO SAY THAT THESE PRACTICES. CHILDREN BEING SEPARATED FROM THEIR FAMILIES. FROM BEING CAGED. WILL NOT BE TOLERATED PEOPLE LOOK. TO THE WEST THEY LOOK TO AMERICA. SET THE TONE. ON EVERY POLICY. YOU CAN IMAGINE. THINK ABOUT THE MESSAGE THAT IT SENDS RIGHT NOW ABOUT WHAT THIS COUNTRY THINKS ABOUT CHILDREN. GIVEN THE TREATMENT. THEIR REFUGEE TREAT CHILDREN ARE BEING PROVIDED YOU DON'T NEED TO BE A PSYCHOLOGIST. TO UNDERSTAND THE NEGATIVE IMPACT. THAT IS BEING HAD. ON CHILDREN WERE CRYING. MOMMY POPPY FOR THEIR PARENTS. IN THE FACE. BOB GUARDS WHO WILL SAY THINGS LIKE DON'T THEY SOUND LIKE AN ORCHESTRA [inaudible] RIDICULING THEM. IN THE FACE OF A NATIONAL LEADER AN INTERNATIONAL LEADER. AN INTERNATIONAL LEADER. WHO SAYS THAT AMERICA WON'T BE A REFUGEE HOLDING CENTER WHERE OUR HUMANITARIAN VALUES? TO PROTECT CHILDREN AND I'LL TELL YOU THIS I WAS NOT A REFUGEE. BUT I SPENT MOST OF MY LIFE GROWING UP WITHOUT MY PARENTS. FROM THE TIME I WAS SIX YEARS OLD. AND SO WHEN I CELEBRATE FATHER'S DAY I AM SO GRATEFUL TO BE ABLE TO BE. IN THE LIVES OF MY CHILDREN. I GREW UP WITHOUT MY FATHER AND MY MOTHER. AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO VOTE ON A RESOLUTION TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE IMPORTANCE OF FATHERS DAY I INVITE EVERY MEMBER ON THIS FLOOR. TO THINK ABOUT THIS RESOLUTION AND WHAT IT REALLY REPRESENTS FROM THE STANDPOINT OF PARENTS. WOULD YOU WANT YOUR CHILDREN SEPARATED FROM YOU. WOULD YOU WANT YOUR CHILDREN TO BE INCARCERATED WOULD YOU WANT YOUR CHILDREN TO BE [inaudible] RIDICULE [inaudible] I KNOW. AND BELIEVE THAT FOR YOU THE ANSWER WOULD BE NO RAISE YOUR VOICE. THE THE LEADERS OF THE WORLD SAY THIS IS THE WRONG POLICY. I STRONGLY URGE YOU I VOTE ON HR. NINETY ONE THANK YOU MISTER US KALRA. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I THANK OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO FOR BRINGING THIS RESOLUTION FORWARD IN AS OUR COLLEAGUE FROM RICHMOND. SYNDICATED IS NOT JUST GOOD ENOUGH FOR US TO SPEAK UP. WE MUST ACT BECAUSE WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW REFLECTS ON ALL OF US AS AMERICANS. WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THESE CHILDREN'S CHILDREN THESE FAMILIES -- IS A STATEMENT ABOUT WHO WE ARE. AND WHAT WE DO RIGHT NOW SPEAKS ABOUT WHO WE ARE NOT JUST AS INDIVIDUALS NOT JUST HAS LEADERS BUT AS A STATE. AND A GREAT NATION. THAT'S NOT ACTING SO GREAT RIGHT NOW. AND SO I IMPLORE EVERYONE THE DO WHATEVER THEY CAN BOTH IN THIS CHAMBER AND OUTSIDE THIS CHAMBER. DO WHATEVER THEY CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE AT THE VERY LEAST AS WE DEBATE. NATIONALLY AT THE STATE LEVEL IMMIGRATION POLICY IS WE DO BROUGH COULD TO DEBATE PUBLIC SAFETY IN ALL THESE ISSUES WE DEBATE. YOUR LONG IN THIS CHAMBER AND MANY OTHERS ACROSS THIS NATION THE RELEASE CAN AGREE ON THE FACT THAT. FAMILIES NOT BE SEPARATED BY CHILDREN SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN FROM THEIR MOTHERS. AND FROM THEIR FATHERS AND DESPITE THE RHETORIC THAT THIS HAS BEEN A POLICY IN THE PAST WE KNOW TIME AND AGAIN THIS IS PROVEN TO BE UNTRUE. BOTH UNDER THE BUSH AND OBAMA PRESIDENCY THEY DID NOT. WILLFULLY SEPARATE CHILDREN FROM THEIR FAMILIES. AND SO BEACON REPEAT LIES AGAIN AND AGAIN BUT WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE LIES THE MATTER HOW MANY TIMES THE REPEATED. AND SO I WOULD JUST ASK ALL MY COLLEAGUES ESPECIALLY THOSE. OF THAT HAD THE ABILITY -- TO SPEAK. ADD TO THIS PRESIDENT AND THIS ADMINISTRATION IN A WAY THAT MAYBE SOME OF US DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO BECAUSE OF PARTISANSHIP OR WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE. TO RAISE YOUR VOICE UP SCIENCE IS UNACCEPTABLE AND AS YOU WONDERED WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE DONE. WHEN CITIZENS OF JAPANESE DESCENT WERE BEING PUT ON TRAINS? AND SENT TO INTERNMENT CAMPS. IF YOU WONDER WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE DONE. IF YOU WERE A* GERMANY. WHEN JEWS WERE BEING SEGREGATED INTO GHETTOS IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHAT YOU WOULD DONE YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT NOW?

I'VE BEEN AROUND THE WORLD A LOT AND SEEN A LOT OF NOT SO AYE SITUATIONS. AND MANY PEOPLE DO. WORRY ABOUT THEIR LIVES IN THE YOU SEE PEOPLE BEING MOVED AROUND THE THEIR BECAUSE OF ECONOMIC OR WAR [inaudible] THEIR SUFFERING. I REMEMBER IN KOREA. SEE IN A YEAR AND A A THIS OLDER LADY HAD ABOUT TWENTY OR THIRTY LITTLE REFUGEE KIDS ORPHANS. AND IT WAS ABOUT. FIVE DEGREES OUTSIDE. IN THEY WOULD COME OUT OF THIS LITTLE HOUSE. EARLY IN THE MORNING IN THE IN THE THE COLD IN THE FILE WAS THERE. AND THAT COME UP TO OUR UNITS AND BEG FOR FOOD.

YOU SWEET OUR COUNTRY DOES NOT TAKE CHILDREN AWAY FROM THE PARENTS [inaudible] THAT'S WRONG [inaudible] THINGS CHAVEZ MISS MELENDEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER LADIES AND GENTLEMEN I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION TODAY -- AND I JUST. LISTENING TO THE COMMENTS IT SOUNDS LIKE WE ARE DEBATING SOMETHING DIFFERENT THEN WHAT HAS BEEN PRESENTED WE ARE THIS IS A RESOLUTION ON REFUGEES IN AMERICA'S COMMITMENT TO ACCEPTING THEM. AND HELPING THEM ONCE THEY'RE HERE THIS IS NOT A RESOLUTION ON THOSE TWO ARE IN AN IMMIGRATION SITUATION OR THEY'RE SEEKING ASYLUM -- HOWEVER [inaudible] I JUST [inaudible] ONE ED. ARE I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT I'M I AM HAPPY TO HEAR SO MANY PEOPLE STAND UP AND TALK ABOUT -- BET THEY ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH SOME OF THE CONDITIONS -- THAT SOME OF THEIR CHILDREN HAVE LIVED IN WEATHER THAT'S RIGHT NOW OR WHETHER IT GOES BACK TO TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN WHEN THERE IS ABOUT EIGHTY THOUSAND CENTRAL AMERICAN REFUGEES -- WHO WERE NOT GIVEN SUCH A WARM WELCOME BUYER PRESIDENT AT THAT TIME IN FACT I THINK WE HAD A? DELEGATION OF LATINO LEGISLATORS WHO WANTS TO ONE OF THESE FACILITIES AND CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THEY WERE SATISFIED WITH THE CONDITIONS THAT WERE THERE DESPITE THE FACT THAT. AS WE HAVE ALL SEEN THE PICTURES HAD BEEN CIRCULATING OF CHILDREN. WHO LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE IN CAGES AND THOSE ARE PICTURES FROM TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AND THOSE ARE THE CONDITIONS? THAT THOSE CHILDREN ARE LIVING AND SO I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM DOESN'T WANT TO SEE THAT AMERICA HAS TAKEN IN. MORE REFUGEES THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY OUT THERE WE ARE A GENEROUS NATION. NOT ONLY DO WE ACCEPT THEM IN BUT THERE'S FUNDING PROVIDED FOR THEIR EDUCATION FOR THEM TO LEARN JOB SKILLS FOR THEM TO TAKE CARE THEIR FAMILIES AND HEALTH CARE. WE ARE A GENEROUS NATION WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE. ON IT SO I JOIN WITH YOU IN SUPPORTING. ALL DISCUSSION HAVING CEASED ON THE RESOLUTION. MR MCCARTY YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I AM EXTREMELY PROUD OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLY THIS AFTERNOON FOR SPEAKING UP ON THIS ISSUE.

THE TODAY WE'RE SAYING YES. UNANIMOUSLY ON HR NINETY ONE WERE SAYING YES WE WANT AND A MORAL. AND JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT TO MILITARY THAT ARE BORDER AS WE DEAL WITH OUR IMMIGRATION AND REFUGEE PROCESS.

THANK YOU MR MCCARTY AND MR MCCARTY YOU WOULD LIKE THE FIRST ROLE FOR CO AUTHORS ON THE RESOLUTION I BELIEVE MEMBERS THIS IS FOR CO AUTHORS. CLARK LOOKED IN THE ROLL-ON WALKERS.

LIKE TO RECOGNIZE THE LEADERS FROM OPENING DOORS INCORPORATED. THE INTERNATIONAL RESCUE COMMITTEE. CANYON COMMITTEE WHILE FAMILY CAN MEAN DEVELOPMENT THE SACRAMENT OF FOOD BANK AND FAMILY SERVICES AND WILL RELATE OF SACRAMENTO THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK IN OUR COMMUNITY RESETTLING REFUGEES MEMBERS WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A RECESS THIS IS RECESS UNDER CALL OF THE SPEAKER. WE ARE IN RECESS MEMBERS PLEASE RETURN TO THE FLOOR. SO WE MAY PROCEED WITH THE BUSINESS BEFORE THE HOUSE MEMBERS SESSION AS RESUME PLEASE RETURN TO THE FLOOR MEMBERS WE ARE ON ASSEMBLY THIRD READING. MEMBERS ON THE THIRD READING FILE. FILE ITEMS [inaudible] EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND TWENTY SEVEN PASS AND RETAIN. MEMBERS WE ARE AT FILE ITEM NUMBER. TWENTY FOUR THAT IS A C. OUR TO FORTY NINE BY MISTER GALLAGHER IN THE CLERK WILL READ. ASSEMBLY CONCURRENT RESOLUTION TO FORTY NINE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER RELATIVE TO FATHER'S DAY [inaudible] MEMBERS. PLEASE GIVE YOUR ATTENTION MISTER GALLAGHER MISTER GALLAGHER YOU MAY OPEN. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT ACR TO FORTY NINE A RESOLUTION WHICH RECOGNIZES. THE POSITIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF FATHERS AND FATHER FIGURES. WHO ARE INVOLVED IN THE LIVES OF CALIFORNIA CHILDREN? AS MANY OF US CELEBRATED YESTERDAY FATHER'S DAY -- AND SOME OF EVEN TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW THAT GATHERING OF OF FAMILIES. THEY IT'S IMPORTANT BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR US AS A BODY. TO ALSO RECOGNIZE THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF FATHERS AND FATHERHOOD. FATHERHOOD IS A BLESSING. BEING A PARENT. I THINK REFINES IT MATURES YOU. I KNOW I FOR ONE AND NOT THE SAME MAN I WAS BEFORE MY KIDS WERE BORN. AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE MAN THAT THEY ARE HELPING ME BECOME. I THINK ABOUT MY OWN FATHER IN THE THINGS THAT. THAT HE TAUGHT ME AND THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT HE TAUGHT ME BUT MAYBE THE MOST IMPORTANT WAS. HOW TO BE TRULY LOVING AND RESPECTFUL? TO MY WIFE. AND HOW TO BE INTENTIONAL AND ENGAGE. WITH MY KIDS. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT CHILDREN WITH INVOLVED FATHERS ARE ARE BETTER EQUIPPED. FOR THE INEVITABLE CHALLENGES OF LIFE THEY PERFORM BETTER AT SCHOOL. ARE LESS LIKELY TO GROW UP IN POVERTY OR FACE FOOD INSECURITY. AND ARE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE CHILDHOOD DEPRESSION. HOWEVER TOO MANY. THE OF OUR CHILDREN GROW UP WITHOUT FATHERS YOU KNOW FAR TOO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. AND I LOOK BACK I THINK OF TO EFFORTS BOTH THE WAR ON POVERTY AND THE WAR ON DRUGS. HAD THE EFFECT OF REMOVING MANY FATHERS. FROM THE HOME. ESPECIALLY IN OUR INNER CITIES AND OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. I'VE SEEN IN MY OWN DISTRICT. NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE MANY JET THERE WHERE SEVERAL GENERATIONS NOW GROWN UP. EITHER WITHOUT FATHERS WITHOUT ANY POSITIVE MALE ROLE MODELS IN THE COMMUNITY. THANK GOD BLESS A SINGLE MOTHERS. AND THE GRANDPARENTS IN THE EXTENDED FAMILY WHO ARE DOING EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER. TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE KIDS HAVE A FIGHTING CHANCE BUT TOO OFTEN IT IS A VICIOUS CYCLE. AND SO TODAY I WHEN WE TALK. THEN THIS LEGISLATURE'S FACING SO MANY ISSUES AND CALIFORNIA ONLY TALK ABOUT ISSUES OF POVERTY. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT LACK OF UPWARD MOBILITY? WE TALK ABOUT HOME STABILITY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ESPECIALLY IN OUR YOUTH. WILL BE SEEN IN SOME OF THESE MASS SHOOTINGS. YOUNG PEOPLE WITH NO DIRECTION AND THAT WOULD GO AND ACTUALLY DO THAT. AND MANY OF THOSE CASES. NO FATHERS NO FATHER FIGURES. THERE TO STEP IN. SO WE KNOW THAT FATHERS HAVE A VERY CRITICAL ROLE TO PLAY. IN ALL THESE ISSUES AND SO WAS TODAY AS WE ARE AS WE COMMEMORATE AS WE CELEBRATED YESTERDAY FATHER'S DAY. LET'S COMMIT OURSELVES. NOW LET ME JUST ECHO. LET ME JUST ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE PREVIOUS RESOLUTION [inaudible] ANY POLICY [inaudible] ANY POLICY THEY WOULD ARBITRARILY RIP. FROM THERE PICKED THEIR CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS HANDS. IS WRONG IT SHOULD CEASE IMMEDIATELY. SO TODAY ON AS WE COMMEMORATE AS WE COMMIT OURSELVES. TELL BEEN CONNECT IN EMPOWER FATHERS. LET'S CONTINUE THAT WORK ARE COMMUNITIES DESPERATELY NEEDED. THANK YOU MEMBERS. THANK YOU MISTER GALLAGHER MISTER HOLDEN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THEY YOU SPEAKER AND I'D LIKE TO THANK THE MEMBER FROM NICHOLAS FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE -- FOR I RISE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS. IN SUPPORT OF ACR TO FORTY NINE RECOGNIZING FATHERS DAY. THEY CAN'T BE SAID ENOUGH THAT FATHERS PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN THEIR CHILDREN'S LIVES WE KNOW HOW VITAL THEIR INVOLVEMENT IS BECAUSE WE KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE. WHEN A CHILD HAS NO FATHER FIGURE? AND THE AFGHAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY OVER 40% OF FATHERS DON'T LIVE WITH THEIR CHILDREN AND FOR CHILDREN UNDER FIVE THIS CAN HAVE A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT. ON THEIR DEVELOPMENT. FROM MASS INCARCERATION THE DOMESTIC IT DISRUPTION FATHERS HAVE BEEN STRIPPED FROM THEIR CHILDREN SIMILAR TO WHAT'S BEEN DONE AT THE BORDERS DUE TO ZERO TOLERANCE POLICIES. UNFORTUNATELY SOME FATHERS WERE NOT ABLE TO BE WITH THEIR CHILDREN THIS FATHER'S DAY. WHICH MAKES ME ME EVEN MORE PRESIDIO THE TIME THAT I'VE HAD WITH MY FAMILY. THE FATHER OF FIVE I TAKE PRIDE IN BEING INVOLVED WITH MY CHILDREN. AND NEVER TAKE FOR GRANTED THE TIME WE SPEND TOGETHER. I PRISSY I'M APPRECIATIVE OF MY FATHER. AND FATHER LIKE FIGURES THAT HAVE RAISED THEIR KIDS TO BE THE CHANGE THAT AMERICA NEEDS. BEING INVOLVED IS ALL WE CAN ASK FOR AND THANK YOU TO ALL THE GREAT FATHERS OUT THERE. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I'VE. TAKING HIS HOLDEN DOCTOR WEBER. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU OF MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM NICHOLAS ALSO FOR ASKING ME TO SHARE WITH. YOU SOME THOUGHTS ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT DAY. A IN OUR CELEBRATION OF FATHER'S DAY. I RISE IN SUPPORT OF ACR TWO FORTY NINE RECOGNIZING ALL OF THE GREAT FATHER'S IN THIS NATION. AND WHAT THEY HAVE MEANT. PARTICULARLY I RISE BECAUSE SO OFTEN THE INFORMATION AND THAT COMES OUT CONCERNING AFRICAN AMERICAN FATHERS IS NOT ALWAYS COMPLIMENTARY. WE OFTEN HEAR BABY DADDY COMMENTS AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THAT GIVE US THAT IMAGE. OF OF AFRICAN AMERICANS WHO A FATHER'S. AND YET WHEN I THINK ABOUT MY FATHER. AT NOT JUST THE MAN WHO HAVE WAS A SHARECROPPER COMING TO CALIFORNIA FOR HOPE AND ASPIRATIONS VOICE CHILDREN. BUT A MAN WHO TRULY LOVED HIS FAMILY. ALL OF HIS HEART. IN ALL OF HIS MIGHT. AND ALL OF HIS DREAMS AND ALL OF HIS DISAPPOINTMENTS PUT ASIDE. FOR THE LOVE AND CARE OF HIS CHILDREN. YOU SEE BARON AWFUL LOT OF AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN. WE'RE NOT FAMOUS MEN. WOULD NOT NOTABLE MEN WOULD NOT LEADERS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES WHO NOT PASTORS OF CHURCHES. WHO REALLY MAKE ENORMOUS SACRIFICES FOR THEIR CHILDREN? AND IT'S KIND OF AMAZING BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. AND HOW THIS COUNTRY HAS TREATED AFRICAN AMERICAN FAMILIES HISTORICALLY FOR OVER TWO HUNDRED YEARS. WHAT WE SEPARATED THE MEN FROM THEIR CHILDREN AND FROM THEIR WIVES AND WE HAD BREEDING FARMS WE LITERALLY BREED OF THESE MEN AND USE THEM ONLY TO CREATE MORE SLAVES? AND YET AT THE END OF SLAVERY WE FIND THAT THE ONE THING THEY SOUGHT MOST OFTEN WAS TO FIND THEIR FAMILIES. AND IF THEY DIDN'T WAS TO ESTABLISH A FAMILY. AND TO BELIEVE IN THAT FAMILY AND TO GIVE ALL THEY COULD EVEN IN THE FACE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY MET IN AMERICA. TO BE FATHERS. MY DAD WAS A GREAT MAN. NOT REALLY EDUCATED DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF MONEY. BUT HE LOVED HIS EIGHT CHILDREN. WITH ALL OF HIS HEART. HE HAD ONE SUIT THAT HE WORE BECAUSE HE WAS A MASON. AND HE HAD ONE GOOD BLACK SUIT AND A PAIR OF STACY ADAMS SHOES THAT LASTED FOR TWENTY YEARS THAT HE WORE TO MAJOR EVENTS. NOT BECAUSE UPON HIS DEATH HE HAD LOTS OF SUITS BECAUSE EIGHT CHILDREN MADE SURE THAT HE THEY THAT WE BOUGHT HIM EVERYTHING WE THOUGHT HE WON IT. BUT HE NEVER LET US EVER BE DISAPPOINTED IN LIFE. WE ALWAYS KNEW WHERE WE WERE GOING TO SLEEP. WE'RE GOING TO EAT. WE'RE ALWAYS COMFORTABLE. AND WE KNEW THAT IF WE WERE TO FALL HE WOULD PICK US UP. WE KNEW THAT IF THERE WERE DISAPPOINTMENTS HE COULD MAKE A SMILE AND GIVE US WHAT WE NEEDED. TOLD ME HOW IMPORTANT EDUCATION WAS EVERY DAY OF MY LIFE. AND THAT HE WOULD QUOTE DRINK MUDDY WATER AND SLEEP IN A HOLLOW LOG IN WANTED TO SEND ME TO SCHOOL. AND HE MEANT EVERY WORD OF THAT. AND IS A POWERFUL FORCE THOUGH GIRL TO FIGHT. TO LIVE FOR THE NEXT DAY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE STRONG AND PRINT THE RESILIENT. MY DAD WOULD PICK ME UP AT UCLA. I DID NOTICE THINGS. LIKE THE GIRLS HEAD ON KNEE SOCKS I DIDN'T EVEN LIKE KNEE SOCKS. BUT MY DAD SOLVE THEM AND HE TOOK US TO THE UCLA S. C. GAME AT THE COLISEUM ANYONE HOME SAID TO MY MOTHER YOU GOTTA GO BY HER SYDNEY SOCKS BECAUSE THE COLLEGE GIRLS WHEN THE SOCKS. AND OF COURSE I GOT SOME DIDN'T LIKE HIM BUT ALWAYS WARM WHEN I SAW HIM. BECAUSE HE THOUGHT AS A COLLEGE STUDENT I NEEDED ME SIGH. YOU CAN AFFORD TO BUY ME A CAR. BUT I WORKED AND BOUGHT A CAR BUT HE MADE SURE THAT CAR WAS CHECKED OUT EVERY WEEKEND TO MAKE SURE THE OIL WAS GOOD THE TIRES ROACH STRAIGHT AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS TO MAKE SURE THAT I HE PARTICIPATED. IN MY EDUCATION. AND EVERYTHING THAT WAS THERE HE DID IT. ONE STORY I REMEMBER HE'D NEVER SAW ME REALLY STUDY HARD BECAUSE I LIVED IN THE DORM BUT WHEN I CAME HOME ONE SUMMER. I WAS STUDYING OVER AND OVER FOR A GREEK MOMENT OR TOWARDS PRESENTATION. IT WAS ONLY TEST THAT WAS NO OTHER UP. ANYTHING JUST ONE TEST. AND I HAD TO START STUDYING IN THE MORNING AND I STUDY NAY AFTERNOON ABOUT OUT THERE IN THE HIT WE GOT HOME I WAS STILL STUDYING. A FRIDAY NIGHT INVESTED IT ALL NIGHT LONG. MY DADDY GOT UP AND WALKED BACK AND FORTH TO THE BATHROOM I THOUGHT SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH HIM AND HE PEOPLE AND SAY HAVING TO FINISH YET. AND I SAY NO LESS DEVELOPMENT MORE. AND HE WAS SO CONCERNED ALL NIGHT LONG. FIND OUT TO SLEEP ABOUT. FOUR THIRTY FIVE ONLY TO WAKE UP AND SEE A CLOCK. TO THE SMELL OF BACON AND EGGS IN THE KITCHEN. BEING COOKED BY MY FATHER WHO HAD WORKED FIFTY HOURS THAT WEEK TEN HOURS A DAY EVERY DAY. AND YET HE GOT UP IN THE MORNING ON SATURDAY. COOKED MY BREAKFAST. HE SAID TO ME JUST DRIVE TO DO WELL. SO MY GREAT OF AN A CAME IN THE NEXT WEEK UP PUT IT ON HIS MAIL. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HE HAD EARNED. I SAY THIS NOT SAY THIS OFTEN TO FATHERS ALL ACROSS THE NATION YOU MAY NOT HAVE ALL OF THESE THINGS A HOLLYWOOD IN THE MOVIES TELL PEOPLE THAT THEY NEED. WHAT'S YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO MOTIVATE YOUR CHILDREN. SHOW THEM THAT YOU LOVE THEM. I GIVE THEM THE STRENGTH TO PERSEVERE INS TO MOVE FORWARD. AND I CELEBRATE ALL OF THOSE ORDINARY FATHERS EVERYDAY.

THE GENTLEWOMAN FROM SAN DIEGO ALWAYS SAYS IT SO WELL -- YEAH AND REALLY GIVES US THE PICTURE.

FATHER YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE EXTRAORDINARY WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES AND THOSE OF US WHO ARE FATHERS KNOW THAT VERY WELL -- BUT IT'S THE ORDINARY. AND EVERYDAY AND I THINK WHAT YOU LEARN MOST AS BEING A THAT I BEING A FATHER MEANS ABOUT. SACRIFICE IT MEANS ABOUT NOT BEING SELFISH.

IN THIS IN THIS COUNTRY. AND WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE POLICIES THAT CAN TEAR FAMILIES APART. RATHER BRING THEM TOGETHER SO HOW DO WE NOT ONLY KEEP THAT FROM HAPPENING BUT HOW DO WE PASS POLICIES THAT ACTUALLY.

A PHILIPPINE INDEPENDENCE DAY MARKS THE DAY IN HISTORY THE FILIPINO SUCCESSFULLY GAINED INDEPENDENCE FOLLOWING THREE HUNDRED YEARS OF SPANISH COLONIAL RULE. AND COLLEAGUES PHILIPPINE INDEPENDENCE DAY AT ITS CORE IS ABOUT THE FIGHT FOR FREEDOM LIBERTY SELF DETERMINATION AND INDEPENDENCE PUBLISHED ON FAMILIAR TO A LOT OF US IN THIS ROOM. AND ALTHOUGH THAT FIGHT FOR JOE INTO THAT FIGHT FOR JUSTICE A SPIRIT OF RESILIENCE AND COMPASSION HAS BEEN INGRAINED IN THE FILIPINO CULTURE. SPIRIT THAT WAS EMBODIED A BY THE FILIPINO PROTESTERS WHO HANDED OUT FLOWERS TO THE SOLDIERS DURING THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX POWER. PEOPLE POWER REVOLUTION FIGHTING FORCE WITH COMPASSION. AND THIS SPIRIT THAT RESONATED WITH THE LATE ANTHONY BOURDAIN WHEN HE VISIT THE PHILIPPINES AND WHEN HE SAID THAT QUOTE FILIPINOS ARE. FOR REASONS I HAVE YET TO FIGURE OUT PROBABLY THE MOST GIVING OF ALL THE PEOPLE ON THE PLANET. TODAY WE COMMEMORATE NOT ONLY THE FIGHT FOR JUSTICE. SPIRITED RESILIENCE IN OF COMPASSION IN THE FILIPINO COMMUNITY THAT HAS REVERBERATED THROUGHOUT THEIR EFFORTS TO PURSUE JUSTICE AND INDEPENDENCE. THAT FIGHT FOR JUSTICE LIVES ON TODAY WITH THE THREE POINT FIVE MILLION FILIPINO AMERICANS WHO LIVE IN THIS COUNTRY. ONE POINT FOUR MILLION OF WHICH LIVE RIGHT HERE IN THE GOLDEN STATE. IT'S LIVES ON IN THE PURSUIT OF THEIR OPPORTUNITY HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND OPPORTUNITIES TO SURVIVE AND THRIVE IN A STATE THAT BELIEVES IN THEM. AND THEN A STATE THAT HAS GIVEN THEM OPPORTUNITIES THAT I KNOW CERTAINLY FROM MY FAMILY ARE SO GREATLY APPRECIATED. AC FIFTY ACR FIVE TO FIFTY ONE IS A TESTAMENT TO THE RESILIENCE AND COMPASSIONATE FILIPINOS. I LOOK FOR TO COMMEMORATING THE SACRIFICES MADE BY THE FILIPINO COMMUNITY FOR ITS SOVEREIGNTY.

THE THOUGHTLESSNESS TO JUDGESHIPS IN RIVERSIDE SUPERIOR COURT IN APPELLATE JUSTICE IN THE FOURTH APPELLATE DISTRICT. A DOZEN MN SO I PRAYED TO DIRECT UNPAID RESIDUAL CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENTS TO NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS WERE FOUNDATION SUPPORT PROJECTS THAT WILL BENEFIT THE CLASS. SIMILARLY SITUATED PEOPLE. IT ALSO ESTABLISHES A PILOT PROGRAM FOR ONLINE ADJUDICATION OF TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS. WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK PRIVATE. BIG TING MISTER OBERNOLTE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS THIS BILL ALLOCATES AN ADDITIONAL TWO JUDGES TO THE RIVERSIDE SUPERIOR COURT. THESE JUDGES ARE BADLY NEEDED HOWEVER THIS IS JUST A DROP IN THE BUCKET ACCORDING TO JUDICIAL COUNCIL THE JUDICIAL NEED IS FOR AN ADDITIONAL HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE MORE JUDGES IN CALIFORNIA COURTS AND THAT'S JUST TO MEET THE CURRENT NEED THAT WE HAVE. SO IT'S GREAT THAT WE'RE ALLOCATING AN ADDITIONAL TWO BUT I'M VERY HOPEFUL THAT IN FUTURE YEARS WE CAN MAKE PUTS A MEANINGFUL RESOURCES TOWARD MEETING THIS UNMET NEED. I ALSO HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THE WAY THAT THESE JUDGES ARE BEING AWARDED. THIS A PRACTICE OF AWARDING THEM TWO ONE CERTAIN CORD VIOLATES LONGSTANDING LEGISLATIVE PRACTICE OF ALLOWING THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO ALLOCATE JUDGESHIPS ACCORDING TO THEIR ASSESSMENT OF JUDICIAL NEED. OF THIS TURNS IT INTO A POLITICAL ISSUE WHICH I THINK SO I'M SUPPORTING THE BILL BUT I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED. ABOUT THE ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY AND I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN DO BETTER IN THE FUTURE. THING WHICH OBERNOLTE SEEN NO. ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION DEBATE ON THE ITEM MISTER TEAM A CLOSE IF YOU WISH. WITH THAT CORP LIBERAL. ON MEMBERS VOTE. WE DECIDED VOTE ALL MEMBERS VOTER DESIRE TO VOTE.

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER THIS BILL ENACTS A WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT POLICY CHANGES. THAT ARE DESIGNED TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR AN EMPLOYEE TO LEAVE OUR UNION. BUT THIS BILL APPARENTLY PRESUPPOSES A DECISION BY THE SUPREME COURT THAT WOULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR UNION TO COLLECT AGENCY FREEZE FROM EMPLOYEES THAT DON'T WISH TO PAY THEM SO. FIRST OF ALL I THINK IT'S VERY INAPPROPRIATE TO PRESUPPOSE A JUDGMENT THAT HAS NOT YET OCCURRED. ALTHOUGH I AM VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE RIGHT OF EMPLOYEE TO FREELY ASSOCIATE WITH THE UNION AND TO ASK THAT UNION TO REPRESENT THEM WITH THEIR EMPLOYER. I AM ALSO VERY SUPPORTIVE. OF EMPLOYEES RIGHT TO LEAVE THE UNION IF THEY DECIDE THAT UNION NO LONGER REPRESENTS THEIR BEST INTEREST THIS BILL ACTS AGAINST THAT RIGHT AND I URGE A NO VOTE. THING WHICH OBERNOLTE MISTER FONG. I THINK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS AT THIS BUDGET TRAILER BILL -- THERE IS IT A SPECIFIC PROVISION IN THIS BUDGET TRAILER BILL THAT DIRECTLY INTERFERES WITH THE OPERATIONS AND THE FISCAL HEALTH OF THE CURRENT HEALTH AUTHORITY AND KERN MEDICAL -- IT IS THE ONLY PUBLIC HEALTH HOSPITAL AND KERN COUNTY IS THE ONLY TRAUMA CENTER IN KERN COUNTY IT DIRECTLY AFFECTS AND HARMS THE PUBLIC IN FISCAL HEALTH OF THIS INSTITUTION.

HOWEVER I JUST WANT TO RAISE A POINT AND THAT'S THAT IF WE ARE IN AGREEMENT. TODAY THAT CALIFORNIA'S DIFFICULT BUSINESS CLIMATE MAKES IT HARD FOR THE MOTION PICTURE INDUSTRY TO COMPETE AGAINST THAT INDUSTRY IN OTHER STATES. WOULDN'T WE BE BETTER SERVED. TO WORK TOGETHER TO IMPROVE OUR BUSINESS CLIMATE HERE IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WE CAN'T EXTEND TAX CREDITS TO EVERY INDUSTRY THAT HAS DIFFICULTY COMPETING. NOW HAVING SAID THAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST HAS FOUND THAT THIS TAX CREDIT ACTUALLY DOES WORK AND I DOES LEAD TO INCREASED FILMING HERE IN ITS FOR FULFILLING ITS -- IT'S OUR PURPOSE WHEN WE PASSED ORIGINALLY SO AYE URGENT AYE VOTE.

PROGRAM IN ORDER TO CONSIDER CALIFORNIA'S LOCATION AND THEIR PRODUCTION PLANNING S. B. EIGHT SEVEN ONE WILL EXTEND THE EXISTING PROGRAM WITH SEVERAL SEVERAL IMPROVEMENTS AS WELL FOR ANOTHER FIVE YEARS. THESE IMPROVEMENTS INCLUDE EFFORTS TO INCREASE THE DIVERSITY OF THOSE WORKING IN BELOW THE LINE POSITIONS THROUGH INNOVATIVE CAREER TRAINING PROGRAMS. GATHERING INFORMATION ON THE DIVERSITY OF THOSE HELMING THESE PRODUCTIONS WHICH IS ABOVE THE LINE. CREATING A SAFE WORKPLACE BY REQUIRING THE FILING UPS HARASSMENT PREVENTION POLICIES WITH THE CALIFORNIA FILM COMMISSION. INCLUDING IDENTIFYING WHO RECEIVES SUCH COMPLAINTS AND OTHER MORE TECHNICAL LOGISTICAL CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM TO IMPROVE ITS ADMINISTRATION BUT I WOULD SAY NOTABLY TO ALLOW -- ME A PROVISION IN THERE THAT INCLUDES WORKING WITH OUR ISSUES FOR OUR SCORES IN OUR MUSICIANS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE ALSO BENEFITING FROM THE FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT. WHICH WE WERE VERY HAPPY TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT ON SO S. B. EIGHT SEVENTY ONE WILL CONTINUE TO RESTORE CALIFORNIA'S COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE FOR FILM TV PRODUCTION.

AND I IT'S BEEN DOING THAT INCIDENTAL -- TO THE AND THEY'RE BEING INCENTIVES IN OTHER STATES AND THAT'S WHY AS MANY OF YOU REMEMBER WE PASSED. AT THE BILL IN TWENTY FOURTEEN TO PROTECT AND SUPPORT A THRIVING ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THAT REAUTHORIZATION OF THE TAX CREDIT IS PROVED TO BE AN UNQUALIFIED SUCCESS PUMPING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BACK INTO OUR CALIFORNIA ECONOMY. THESE DOLLARS FLOWED DIRECTLY INTO THE THOUSANDS OF OUR CONSTITUENTS EMPLOYED IN SOLID MIDDLE CLASS JOBS AND THEY SUSTAIN HUNDREDS OF SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THE FILM INDUSTRY. AND FINALLY THEY SUPPORT COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. WELL WE CELEBRATE OUR SUCCESSES WE CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT REST ON OUR LAURELS FACED WITH CONTINUING EFFORTS TO LURE FILM AND CONTENT. PRODUCTION ELSEWHERE IT IS INCUMBENT UPON CALIFORNIA TO TAKE STEPS TO ASSURE THAT WE RETAIN OUR PLACE. AS THE HOME OF THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY AND NEVER EVER RELINQUISH THAT POSITION THAT'S THE MESSAGE THAT OTHER STATES NEED TO HEAR FROM CALIFORNIA. AND THAT'S WHY S. B. EIGHT SEVENTY ONE IS SO IMPORTANT THIS BILL IS ABOUT KEEPING HOLLYWOOD IN CALIFORNIA WHERE IT WAS BORN AND WHERE IT BELONGS.

THINGS TAKE MISTER OBERNOLTE MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB EIGHTEEN NO EIGHT I BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL WILL HAVE A VERY POSITIVE AND MEANINGFUL IMPACT ON K. TWELVE EDUCATION. IN CALIFORNIA IT WILL FULLY FUND THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA IT WILL DEVOTE THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND K. TWELVE SETTINGS -- IT WILL ESTABLISH A GRANT ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEM OF TEACHER SHORTAGES PARTICULARLY IN TECHNICAL FIELDS BUT WHAT I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT MY MOST OF MY FAVORITE APPROPRIATIONS BILL. IS IT WILL ESTABLISH THE KIDS CODE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS A GRANT PROGRAM TO SUPPORT TEACHING KIDS INCAPABLE SETTINGS. HOW TO PROGRAM COMPUTERS AND AS A RECOVERING COMPUTER PROGRAMMER WHO HAS WRITTEN MILLIONS OF LINES OF CODE HIS CAREER AND AS SOMEONE WHO WAS INTERVIEWED AND HIRED HUNDREDS OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMERS?

HIS THANK YOU SPEAKER MEMBERS ALL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BECAUSE IT INCLUDES. MANY PROVISIONS THAT ARE BENEFICIAL TO IMPROVING OUR STATE'S EDUCATION SYSTEM. I AM HOWEVER DISHEARTENED TO SEE THAT THERE'S NOT BEEN FUNDING. INCLUDED FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION. THIS OF BEEN AN ONGOING ISSUE SECURING EQUALIZED FUNDS SO THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE ARE PROPERLY FUNDED. THIS IS A DESERVING POPULATION THAT IS MEANT TO BENEFIT FROM THE GOVERNMENTAL SAFETY NET. WE CANNOT AFFORD TO KEEP KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD ON THIS ISSUE. WE NEED TO QUICKLY ACT TO FIND A RESOLUTION OF THIS PROBLEM. YOUR KILEY EUREKA. I MISTER SPEAKER I ALSO MUST SAY I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS RESULTED IN THE REMOVAL OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AN ONGOING GENERAL FUND SUPPORT. FOR OUR SPECIAL EDUCATION SYSTEM. THIS WAS TO BE A VITAL STEP. TOWARDS PROVIDING EQUITY FOR STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS TO ASSURE THAT THEY CAN RECEIVE THE EDUCATION THAT THEY ARE ENTITLED. TO AND THAT THEY DESERVE. THE TRUTH IS THAT WELL CALIFORNIA HAS DRAMATICALLY INCREASED EDUCATION FUNDING IN RECENT YEARS. SPECIAL EDUCATION HAS NOT BEEN A PRIORITY. OVER SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND K. TWELVE STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS ARE STILL NOT GETTING NEARLY THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED. CURRENT SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING RATES AND HERE TO AN ARCHAIC FORMULA THE PRESENT PRODUCES VAST INEQUITIES. IN SOME REGIONS THE ADA BASE RATES ARE AS HIGH AS FOUR HUNDRED NINETY SIX DOLLARS WHILE IN OTHER DISTRICTS THERE IS A LOW AS FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT DOLLARS. FURTHER THE GROWTH OF THESE RATES IS TIED OVERALL STUDENT ENROLLMENT NOT TO THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. I SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS RISE WITHOUT ADDITIONAL STATE SUPPORT LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS FACE MORE MORE PRESSURE ON THEIR GENERAL FUND BUDGETS THAT'S WHY ARE SO PLEASANT SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE ASKED URGENTLY. FOR OUR HELP. IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT WE ARE NOT ABLE TO DELIVER AND FOR THE SAKE OF SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENTS ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA I HOPE THAT IN THE FUTURE WE CAN DO BETTER. THANK YOU MISTER KILEY MR MCCARTY YOUR RECORDS.

TRAILER BILL -- THE BILL'S MAJOR PROVISIONS ARE THE CREATION OF A NEW ONLINE COLLEGE BY COURSES AND PROGRAMS AT THE TO SHORT TERM. INDUSTRY VALUED CERTIFICATES ARE CREATES A NEW COMMUNITY COLLEGE FUNDING FORMULA WHICH PROVIDES COLLEGES FUNDING FOR ENROLLMENT OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS A SPECIFIC OUTCOMES. IT ALSO EXPANDS FINANCIAL AID FOR ELIGIBLE COMMUNICATE LISTINGS BY PROVIDING UP TO FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY TO COVER NON TUITION COSTS. IT ALSO PROVIDES COMMITTEE COLLEGES FUNDING TO ADDRESS STUDENT HUNGER. BASIC NEEDS SUPPORT CAMPUS VETERANS RESOURCES CENTER SUPPORT PROGRAMS FOR CURRENTLY INFORMALLY ACROSS RATED STUDENTS PROVIDES LEGAL SERVICES TO UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS STUDENTS. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES AND TRAINING IN SUPPORT OF OUR PART TIME FACULTY OFFICE HOURS I WOULD THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR I DON'T. TAKING MISTING MR ACOSTA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU TO MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS PSALM I I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY BUT I BELIEVE IT MAKES A LOT OF POSITIVE CHANGES. I DO HOWEVER HAVE A CONCERN. FORMULA OF THE NEW FORMULA DOES NOT PROPERLY SPORT COLLEGES LIKE COLLEGE OF THE CANYONS IN MY DISTRICT. I WHO PARTNER WITH PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES TO OFFER ON GOING TRAINING THROUGH THE INSTRUCTIONAL SERVICE AGREEMENTS TAUGHT TO CURRENT POLICE OFFICERS AND FIREFIGHTERS. OF THE OUTCOME MEASURES IN THE NEW FORM FORMING A NEW FORMULA SUCH AS DEGREE OR CERTIFICATE COMPLETION MILESTONES AND LOW INCOME STUDENT PROVISIONS FAILED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE SERVICE AGREEMENTS. PUBLIC SAFETY EMPLOYEES ARE GENERALLY NOT ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL AID SINCE THEY WORK FULL TIME NOR WILL THEY BE EARNING DEGREES OR CERTIFICATES. SO COLLEGES OFFERING THIS TRAINING WILL ONLY BE PAID UNDER THE ENROLLMENT PORTION OF THE FORMULA. WOULD FULLY IMPLEMENTED THAT'S JUST 60% OF WHAT THEY NOW RECEIVE TO OFFER THIS TRAINING THAT HELPS ENSURE THE SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITIES. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF THE JUST THE FORMULASO THAT PUBLIC SAFETY TRAINING OFFERED THROUGH THE INSTRUCTIONAL SERVICE AGREEMENTS. IS EXCLUDED FROM THE FORMULA AS WAS ALREADY DONE FOR CERTAIN NON CREDIT COURSES AS A SAID I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS MEASURE AND HOPE WE CAN ENSURE IMPORTANT PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT'S.

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN OPPOSITION DAY BE EIGHTEEN TEN THIS TRAILER BILL ESTABLISHES THE COUNCIL ON HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS. THE STATED INTENT OF THIS COUNCIL IS TO ESTABLISH UNIVERSAL FINANCING FOR HEALTHCARE IN CALIFORNIA WHEN I ASK THE QUESTION OF WHETHER NOT THIS WAS LEADING UP TO SINGLE PAYER HEALTHCARE. IN BUDGET COMMITTEE I WAS TOLD THAT YES IT WAS AND I THINK THAT THAT'S VERY INAPPROPRIATE AS WE ALL KNOW SINGLE PAYER HEALTHCARE HAS BEEN AN ISSUE OF INTENSE DEBATE.

RATHER THAN RESEARCH HOW WE CAN PROVIDE HEALTH CARE TO THE REMAINING CALIFORNIANS WHO DON'T HAVE HEALTH CARE.

RESEARCH AND STUDY IS GOOD BUT RESEARCH THAT IS NOT OPEN TO BETTER OUTCOMES IS BIASED AND DAMAGING TO OUR STATE. I CAN'T VOTE FOR A STUDY. I CAN'T VOTE FOR A TO STUDY HOW THE STATE CAN BEST PUT THOUSANDS OF HEALTH CARE WORKERS OUT OF JOBS I CAN'T GO FOR STUDY.

AS YOU KNOW WITH ONE OF FIVE CALIFORNIANS LIVING IN POVERTY IN MANY OF THEM IN DEEP POVERTY -- THIS TRAILER BILL WAS ESTABLISHED TO REALLY FIGHT IN A TACKLE SOME OF THOSE VERY CHALLENGING ISSUES. IT SETS A GOAL OF NO CHILD IN DEEP POVERTY STATING STARTING WITH THE 10% GRANT. INCREASE STARTING IN APRIL FIRST. TWENTY NINETEEN STEPS AND ENSUING YEARS SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATIONS AND FUTURE BUDGET SO THAT ONE DAY NO CHILD WILL LIVE UNDER 50% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL.

MR OBERNOLTE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS EXISTING STATE LAW ESTABLISHES A WELFARE TO WORK REQUIREMENT FOR CAL WORKS RECIPIENTS HOWEVER IF A RECIPIENT. IS A STUDENT ENROLLED IN A DEGREE PRINTING PROGRAMMER CERTIFICATE GRANTING PROGRAM THAT WILL ENHANCE THEIR EMPLOYABILITY. EXISTING STATE LAW ALLOWS THEM TO COUNT THE CLASSROOM HOURS SPENT IN PURSUIT OF THAT DEGREE OF THAT CERTIFICATE TO WARDS THAT WORK REQUIREMENT WHICH I THINK IS VERY APPROPRIATE. UNFORTUNATELY THIS TRAILER BILL EXTENDS THE HAD TO SELF REPORTED INDEPENDENT HOME STUDY TIME. THAT IS NOTORIOUSLY DIFFICULT. TO TO POLICE AND I FEAR THAT IT'S GOING TO LEAD TO GREATER POTENTIAL FOR FRAUD AND ABUSE IN THE CAL WORK SYSTEM. MOREOVER IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO INDEPENDENTLY VERIFY THE SOFT REPORTED STUDY TIME IT WOULD ALSO BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR COUNTIES TO CONTEST THAT SOFT REPORTED STUDY TIME IF THEY FELT.
