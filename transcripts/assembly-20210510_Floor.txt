WHERE VICTIMS ARE NOT ABLE TO DO THIS BECAUSE THE ENROLLMENT AGREEMENT SIGNED BY THEIR PARENT- INCLUDED AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE NOW OF COURSE THERE ARE MANY REASONS THE CONTRACTING PARTIES MIGHT. CHOOSE TO AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTES IN ART IN AN ARBITRAL FORUM- BUT THESE REASONS ARE NOT APPLICABLE IN THE CASE OF A VICTIM OF CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ASSAULT WHO'S BEING FORCED INTO ARBITRATION. AGAINST THEIR WILL FOR ONE THING EDUCATION IS BOTH A RIGHT AND AN OBLIGATION. UNLIKE CONTRACTS FOR SERVICES OR OTHER BUSINESS VENTURES A STUDENT DOES NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO OPT OUT OF THEIR EDUCATION CALIFORNIA LAW REQUIRES MINERS TO ATTEND SCHOOL AND OF COURSE EDUCATION IS CRUCIAL. TO THE FUTURE SUCCESS SECONDLY CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ASSAULT IS NOT A FORESEEABLE CIRCUMSTANCE WHEN ENROLLING IN SCHOOL AND THIRDLY CALIFORNIA LAW IS CLEAR ON THE DIFFERENCE IN TREATMENT AFFORDED TO MINORS PURTON CASE LAW ESTABLISHES THAT CLAIMS HELD BY CHILDREN COULD NOT BE FORCED INTO ARBITRATION.

EVERY YEAR THIS LEGISLATURE INTRODUCES AN AVERAGE OF FIFTY BILLS THAT AFFECT THE DEPARTMENT AND THE TWENTY SIX MILLION CALIFORNIANS SERVED BY THE DEPARTMENT. THE CONSUMER PARTICIPATION PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND TWO TO HELP THE DEPARTMENT FULFILL THEIR MISSION AND ENSURE CONSUMERS HAVE A SAY IN THEIR RECORDS AND MEDICAL DECISIONS. AFTER ALMOST TWO DECADES IN EXISTENCE THE CONSUMER PROGRAM IS NO LONGER NEW AND EXPERIMENTAL BUT RATHER A WELL DEMONSTRATED AND SUCCESSFUL TOOL FOR PROVIDING CONSUMERS AN IMPORTANT ADVOCATE IN THEIR CORNER. THIS BILL HAS NO OPPOSITION AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MS RIVAS MR GALLAGHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL AND I THINK WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT THIS PROGRAM THAT WE'VE WE'VE CONSISTENTLY EXTENDED THE SUNSET. AND THIS IS REALLY BAD POLICY BECAUSE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE ESSENTIALLY PAYING LOBBYISTS. FOR WORK THAT THEY DO TO GET A REGULATION PUT IN PLACE IMAGINE IF WE DID THAT IN SO MANY OTHER CONTACTS IF A LOBBYIST SUCCESSFULLY GETS THE REGULATION THAT THEY DESIRE FOR THEIR CLIENT. NOT ONLY OTHER CLIENTS GOING TO PAY THEM. BUT THE STATE GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO PAY THEM. FOR BEING CONSUMER FRIENDLY QUOTE UNQUOTE IN THIS IN THIS CASE I THINK THAT'S REALLY BAD POLICY AND SHOULD NOT BE SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE. APPROVING US AND THIS DID HAPPEN ACTUALLY RECENTLY D. MHC PAID TO REGISTERED LOBBYISTS FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS PER HOUR. FOR THEIR WORK UNDER THIS PROGRAM WE SHOULD NOT BE CONDONING THAT NASRI OPPOSITION TODAY.

THANK YOU DR ARAMBULA MR GALLAGHER OU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO KNOW AND FOR THE BODY TO KNOW THAT ACTUALLY COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS OPPOSE THIS BILL AT THIS POINT BECAUSE OF THE UNEQUAL TREATMENT A REIMBURSEMENT MANY OF OUR POPS THAT HELPED MANY PEOPLE IN MENTAL MENTAL HEALTH EMERGENCIES. IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO RUN THOSE PUFFS AND THE FINANCING AND FUNDING THAT COMES IN- IS OFTENTIMES NOT SUFFICIENT SO YOU'RE GOING TO BE PUTTING BY PASSING THIS THE POTENTIAL THAT AND THE AND THE WARNING FROM OUR ACTUAL MENTAL HEALTH DIRECTORS IN OUR COUNTIES IS YOU'RE GOING TO BE PUTTING THEM IN FINANCIAL STRESS. AND THAT MAY NOT BE A VERY GOOD THING IN THE LONG TERM FOR HOW WE DEAL WITH MENTAL HEALTH EMERGENCIES WHICH I THINK WE ALL AGREE WE NEED TO IN THE STATE SO I WOULD CAUTION YOU I THINK THERE DO NEED TO BE CHANGES TO THIS LEGISLATION AS IT MOVES FORWARD TO ENSURE THAT THESE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO OPERATE. THAT ARE PUFFS WHICH ARE. SUCH VITAL PIECES OF OUR MENTAL HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE ABLE TO OPERATE. AND NOT FIND THEMSELVES- UNABLE TO OPERATE.

THAT BRINGS US TO FILE ITEM FORTY THREE AB EIGHT THIRTY EIGHT BY MISS FRIEDMAN CORKERY ASSEMBLY BILL A THIRTY EIGHT BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN AND OTHERS AN ACCOLADE IN THE BUILDING STANDARDS THIS FRIEDMAN YOU MAIL ME THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS HOUSING AND BUILDING CODES ARE INTENDED TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE'S MUNICIPALITIES ACROSS THE STATE HAVE A LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY TO BE THE BACKSTOPS TO DO CODE ENFORCEMENT AND DO INSPECTIONS. IF THERE'S REASON TO BELIEVE THAT A BUILDING IS NOT HABITABLE OR NOT SAFE. HOWEVER SOME MUNICIPALITIES A VERY FEW IN THE STATE BUT SOME MUNICIPALITIES ARE PLACING PRECONDITIONS. ON A TENANT BEFORE THEY DO BASIC HEALTH AND SAFETY INSPECTIONS FOR INSTANCE BILL MAKE SURE THAT THE TENANT MAYBE IS CURRENT ON THEIR RENT. OR MAKE TRIED TO HAVE PROOF THAT THE TENANT FIRST WENT TO A LANDLORD A LANDLORD THAT THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY BE INTIMIDATED BY OR AFRAID OF. THIS IS A VERY SIMPLE BILL THAT STATES. THAT A CITY OR MUNICIPALITY CANNOT PUT THAT KIND OF PRECONDITION ON THE TENANT BEFORE THEY DO. THE HEALTH AND SAFETY INSPECTIONS FOR WHICH THEY ARE ALREADY REQUIRED TO DO BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. MEMBERS THIS BILL WAS SPARKED BY NOT MY READING. OF VERY DISTURBING STORY IN LA US ABOUT SOME SLUM TYPE A UNITS. WHERE BECAUSE THE TENANTS WERE NOT ABLE TO GET THE MUNICIPALITY TO DO INSPECTIONS THEY WERE FORCED TO LIVE IN SUCH UNSAFE CONDITIONS. THAT A FIRE ENSUED AND CHILDREN WERE KILLED. THIS WAS BECAUSE THE CITY REFUSED TO GO AND INSPECT ON THE PROPERTY BECAUSE THE LANDLORD CLAIMED THAT SOME OF THE TENANTS WERE CURRENT ON THEIR RENT. MEMBERS EVERY RENTAL UNIT IN CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE SAFE FOR ATTENDANCE IT'S NOT ON THE TENANT TO MAKE SURE OF THAT IT'S ON THE LANDLORD I'M INTERESTED HOW THE- AND THIS BILL JUST MAKE SURE OF THAT TO PROTECT. SAFETY AND TO PROTECT PEOPLE'S PROPERTY WITHOUT AYE URGENT AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER FREEDOM MISTER GALLAGHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED YEAH I THINK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO THINK ABOUT SMALL LANDLORDS SMALL MOM AND POP LANDLORDS WHO. WHO REALLY JUST NEVER HAVE A VOICE IN THIS BUILDING SO OFTEN THEY DON'T HAVE LOBBYISTS. THEY'RE JUST TRYING THE MOST MANY OF THEM HAVE THIS AS AN INVESTMENT IT IS THEIR INCOME. IN THEIR LATER YEARS OF LIFE BUT NOBODY EVER REALLY SEEM TO SPEAK FOR THEM IN THIS BUILDING AND UNDER. UNDER THIS BILL. SO I'M GONNA SPEAK FORM. UNDER THIS BILL. A COUNTY OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT COULD GO OUT TO INSPECT A PROPERTY BASED ON. AN ALLEGED VIOLATION AND THEY COULD FIND NOT THAT THERE WAS NO VIOLATION WHATSOEVER AND THAT SMALL LANDLORD WILL GET LEFT WITH THE COST OF THAT INSPECTION UNDER THIS BILL. IN THE CURRENT LANGUAGE. DO YOU THINK THAT NOW IS A GOOD TIME TO BE ADDING COSTS EVEN WHEN A LANDLORD HAS DONE NOTHING WRONG. TO BE ADDING COSTS AND REQUIRING. COUNTY CODE ENFORCEMENT OR COUNTY INSPECTORS TO GO OUT ON EVERY SINGLE COMPLAINT- WHEN THOSE MAY BE UNFOUNDED THERE. THERE'S ALREADY IN LAW PROCESS FOR DEALING WITH. WITH LANDLORDS WHO ARE NOT PROVIDING HABITABLE. TENDENCIES THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT PROCESSES FOR PEOPLE TO TAKE CARE OF THAT ISSUE IN THE COURTS TO GOVERNMENT- PROCESS SEES FINES AND PENALTIES FOR THOSE WHO. WHO HAVE ACTUALLY. VIOLATED THESE RULES. BUT TO NOW SAY WE'RE GOING TO FIND YOU EVEN IF WE FIND NOTHING WRONG WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA STICK THE FEE WITH YOU THE SMALL MOM AND POP LANDOWNER EVEN IF YOU'VE DONE NOTHING WRONG WOULD BE A SLAP IN THE FACE. TO PROVIDING ADDITIONAL HOUSING WHICH WHICH THESE PEOPLE DO PROVIDEON A ON A MASSIVE BASIS IN THE STATE. AND WHEN THEY HAVE WHEN THEY- AS OF YET HAVE HAD VERY LITTLE IN THE WAY OF HELP DURING COVERED NINETEEN. I REGION OF VOTE ON THIS ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. THERE WAS GALLAGHER MR VOEPEL YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I RISE IN MILD OPERATION TO THIS BILL NUMBER OPPOSITION HERE'S WHY I AM A SMALL MOM AND POP RENTAL PERSON ACTUALLY IT'S MAINLY RUN BY MOM BECAUSE POPS UP HERE ALL THE TIME. NOW WHEN WE RENT OUT A UNIT. WE HAVE TO SIGN AN AFFIDAVIT THAT SAYS THERE IS NO LEAD IN THE UNIT. WHICH MAKES US VERY LIABLE IF THERE IS ACTUALLY LET SO. MY MILD OPPOSITION IN THIS BILL IS. IF THE LAND LORD IS DOING A PROPER JOB. THEY ARE NOW LIABLE IF THERE IS LEAD IN THE UNIT THEY COULD BE SUED. AND PROBABLY WOULD LOSE IN COURT SO THAT'S MY POINT SIR THANK YOU. THANK YOU PAPA. YES NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. MISREADING YOU MAY CLOSE YEAH THANK YOU I'D LIKE TO JUST ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO SAY THAT WE HVE BEEN VERY PRODUCTIVE TALKS WITH THE REALTORS AND WITH THE APARTMENT OWNERS ASSOCIATION ABOUT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. I'M FRANKLY A LITTLE SHOCKED BY THE SUGGESTION THAT IF A TENANT HAS SERIOUS HABITABILITY ISSUES WITH THE UNIT THAT IF THEY'RE FACING ISSUES THAT ARE SO SEVERE THAT THEY LITERALLY COULD LEAD TO A FIRE COULD LEAD TO A HEALTH IMPACT OR IF THEY DON'T HAVE HEAT BUT THEY DON'T HAVE HOT WATER BUT THEY SHOULD GO TO THE COURTS AND NOT GO TO CODE ENFORCEMENT IN THEIR OWN CITY. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A PROCESS IN EVERY SINGLE CITY THAT YOU ALL REPRESENT WERE TENANTS THAT ARE FACING THOSE KINDS OF EMERGENCY NEEDS CAN GO TO CODE ENFORCEMENT NOW THE BILL DOES NOT CHANGE WHO PAYS FOR THAT A CODE ENFORCEMENT THAT'S DIRECTED BY EVERY CITY WITHIN THEIR OWN ORDINANCES IN MANY CITIES THE CITY ACTUALLY DOES NOT BILL THE LANDLORD IN MY OWN CITY THE CITIES DON'T BUILD THE LANDLORDS ARE BILL DOESN'T CHANGE THAT WE ARE SILENT ON WHO. IS BILL THAT'S REALLY UP TO THE INDIVIDUAL MUNICIPALITIES THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT WHILE MANY CITIES PROBABLY MOST OF THE CITIES THAT YOU ALL REPRESENT A TENANT CAN GO DIRECTLY TO CODE ENFORCEMENT THEY HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM THERE ARE A FEW CITIES THAT SAY THAT TENET NO I DON'T CARE IF YOU DON'T HAVE HOT WATER I DON'T CARE IF YOU DON'T HAVE HEAT I DON'T CARE IF YOU HAVE MOLD I DON'T CARE IF THE WINDOWS ARE BROKEN. YOU HAVE TO PROVE TO ME THAT YOU'VE GONE TO THE LANDLORD FIRST OR YOU HAVE TO PROVE TO ME THAT YOUR CURRENT ON YOUR RENT WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT OUR MOST VULNERABLE TENANTS TENANTS YOU MIGHT BE UNDOCUMENTED TENANTS WHO ARE LOW INCOME AND ARE AFRAID OF ADDICTION DON'T GET CODE ENFORCEMENT OUT AND ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN SUBSTANDARD CONDITIONS. THAT IS THE POPULATION THAT THIS BILL ADDRESSES THIS DOES NOT AFFECT VERY MANY CITIES BECAUSE NOT MANY CITIES PUT THAT BURDEN ON TENANTS MOST CITIES DO THAT CODE ENFORCEMENT WHEN THERE ARE SERIOUS COMPLAINTS. THIS IDEA THAT TENANTS ARE GOING TO BE ENFORCEMENT OUT CALLING THEIR CITIES OUT ON. LANDLORDS IT'S JUST NOT GROUNDED IN ANY OF REAL. BUT WHAT DOES HAPPEN. IS THAT TENANTS WHO ARE POOR. TENANTS YOU MIGHT BE UNDOCUMENTED BECOME AFRAID BECAUSE THEIR LANDLORD SAY. I'M NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS. AND THEY HAVE NO ONE TO TURN TO IN THAT CASE. THIS BILL WAS SPONSORED BY THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AND THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION. IT DOES NOT CHANGE WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR BILLS THAT DOES NOT CHANGE. PROBABLY MOST OF WHAT HAPPENS IN YOUR JURISDICTIONS BUT FOR THOSE FEW TENANTS WHO NEED THIS HELP THIS IS A DESPERATELY NEEDED ACTION TO PROTECT HUMAN SAFETY AND HUMAN HEALTH WITHOUT AYE URGENT AYE VOTE THANK YOU.

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS AB THREE SEVEN NINE CORRECTS AN OVERSIGHT AND CALIFORNIA- CODE THAT PREVENTS THE ACQUISITION OF COUNTY CONSERVATION LANDS BY CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES CURRENTLY A STATE AGENCY MAY ONLY SELL CONSERVATION LANDS TO PUBLIC AGENCIES OR NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS. BUT SINCE NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES ARE NOT EXPLICITLY LISTED IN THE CODE THERE UNABLE TO PARTICIPATE AS CONSERVATIVES OF WILDLIFE LANDS. THIS SEEMS VERY RIDICULOUS SINCE OUR FIRST PEOPLE ARE SOME IN THIS STATE ARE SOME OF THE GREATEST. CONSERVATIONISTS AND KNOW SOME OF THE GREATEST PRACTICES TO HELP CONSERVE OUR LANDS AND THEY SHOULD BE. ABLE TO PARTICIPATE AND TO ACTUALLY MANAGE AND OWN CONSERVATION LANDS- THIS BILL WOULD ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM BY INCLUDING CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES IN THE LIST OF ENTITIES THAT CAN RECEIVE CONSERVATION LANDS AND GRANTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE.

THAT THEY CONTINUE TO- MAKE WORSE HERE OUR STATE'S HOUSING CRISIS. AND AS STATE OFFICIALS AND IS THIS LEGISLATURE HAVE ATTEMPTED TO DO MORE IN ADDRESSING THIS CRISIS. THERE ARE INCREASING INSTANCES OF LOCAL HOUSING MEASURES AND REGULATORY SYSTEM THAT DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY. RESTRICT HOUSING PRODUCTION AND ARMED CONFLICT WITH STATE HOUSING LAWS AND REQUIREMENTS SO CLEARLY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE ANY CHALLENGING SITUATION HAVING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BALANCE LOCAL PLANNING AND REGULATORY HOUSING MEASURES. AND WORKING TO COMPLY WITH EVOLVING STATE HOUSING LAW. SO OFTEN LOCAL OFFICIALS FACE A CATCH TWENTY TWO GIVEN THAT EITHER FAILING TO IMPLEMENT LOCAL HOUSING RELATED MEASURES OR FAILING TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN ASPECTS OF STATE HOUSING LAW CAN BOTH. RESULT IN COSTLY LITIGATION. THIS LEGISLATION THIS BILL CREATES A PROCESS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO AVOID THIS CATCH TWENTY TWO TO SEEK JUDICIAL VALIDATION BUT A LOCAL MEASURE OR VOTER INITIATIVE IS IN CONFLICT WITH STATE HOUSING LAW. CONSISTENT WITH ESTABLISH STATE VALIDATION PROCEDURES THIS OPTION FOR JUDICIAL VALIDATION CREATED BY THIS BILL WOULD RESULT IN AN EXPEDITED JUDICIAL RULING ON THE ISSUE OR QUESTION.

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE TO INTRODUCE AB EIGHT SIXTY ONE. THERE ARE A FEW IMPORTANT POINTS ABOUT AB SIX EIGHT SIXTY ONE AND I APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION AND MY SHORT TWO MINUTE PRESENTATION. THOUSANDS OF HOMES IN MOBILE HOME PARKS ARE COVERED BY LOCAL RENT CONTROL LAWS. THOSE UNITS PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR CALIFORNIANS PARTICULARLY SENIORS ON FIXED INCOME. WHEN ONE OF THOSE HOMES IS PURCHASED BY A PARK OWNER. SHE OR HE IS TAKING THAT HOME OUT OF THE LOCAL RENT STABILIZATION ORDINANCE PROTECTION. AND PARK OWNERS HAVE A SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO ENGAGE IN THAT AFTER. THE MOBILE HOME RESIDENCY LAW WHICH WAS PASSED BY CALVET THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES REQUIRES PARK OWNERS TO ADHERE TO THE SAME RULES THAT THEY IMPOSE ON THEIR RESIDENTS. TODAY RESIDENTS ARE FORBIDDEN TO RENT OUT THEIR OWN HOMES AND YET PARK OWNERS ARE NOT APPLYING THAT LAW TO THEMSELVES. THIS IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SAY PARK OWNERS CAN'T ENT THEIR HOMES OUT BUT THEY CAN'T TREAT THEMSELVES DIFFERENTLY THAN THEIR RESIDENTES. END MORE IMPORTANTLY WHEN THEY WE DON'T WANT THEM TO HAVE AN INCENTIVE TO KEEP PURCHASING THESE HOMES AND PULLING THEM OUT OF LOCAL RENT STABILIZATION. PARK OWNERS HAVE CLAIMED THE LAW PASSED IN THE SEVENTIES REQUIRING THAT ALL HOMES IN A MOBILE HOME PARK BE TREATED EQUALLY DOES NOT APPLY TO THEM. BUT IN TWENTY THIRTEEN ATTORNEY GENERAL KAMALA HARRIS RULES THAT IN FACT IT DOES. THIS ORDINANCE SIMPLY CLARIFIES AND CODIFIES THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S TWENTY THIRTEEN OPINION.

THIS IS FILE ITEM SIXTY NINE AB FORTY THREE BY MS FRIEDMAN CORPORATION. ASSEMBLY BILL FORTY THREE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN AND OTHERS AN ACT RELATING TO TRAFFIC SAFETY. MS FRIEDMAN YOU MAY OPEN THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS THIS MAKING. LET ME TAKE YOU BACK AND TELL YOU A LITTLE STORY FROM MY LOCAL GOVERNMENT DAYS THE CITY OF BURBANK A FEW YEARS AGO AND THERE RANCHO AREA WHICH IS A HORSE OWNED AREA- THEY HAPPEN TO BE NEAR A COUPLE OF HIGHWAYS. AND WHEN THE ADVENT OF APPS TRAFFIC NAVIGATION APPS POPPED UP MORE MORE PEOPLE WERE GETTING OFF OF THE HIGHWAY TO MOVE FOR THIS LITTLE NEIGHBORHOOD. ARE TO BE TRAFFIC AND A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE WEREN'T FAMILIAR WITH THE AREA WE'RE IN A HURRY TO GET TO WORK AND THEY WERE SPEEDING. SO THE NEIGHBORS IN THE AREA WENT TO THEIR CITY COUNCIL AND SAID PLEASE WE NEED SOME TRAFFIC ENFORCEMENT HERE PEOPLE ARE SPEEDING IS A ONE LANE ROADS WE HAVE HORSES WE HAVE KIDS. CAN YOU PLEASE COME OUT AND GIVE SOME TICKETS. WELL THE CITY CAME OUT AND REALIZED I HADN'T DONE A SPEED SURVEY IN TEN YEARS AND THEREFORE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO ENFORCE THE TRAFFIC RULES. THEY DID THEIR SPEED SURVEY AND WONDER OF WONDERS FOUND OUT THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE SPEEDING. BUT BECAUSE OF THE ARCANE WAYS THAT WE ARE FORCED TO SAID TRAFFIC LAWS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN ORDER TO ENFORCE THE CITY BURBANK WAS HAD TO RAISE THE SPEED LIMITS. TO ACCOMMODATE THE SPEEDING TRAFFIC. THAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENS ACROSS OUR STATE. RECENTLY THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES HAD TO RAISE THE SPEED LIMITS. ON LITERALLY OVER A HUNDRED MILES OF ROADS. JUST TO ENFORCE SPEEDING IN TO TRY TO STOP SPEEDING AND RECKLESS DRIVING. SO A FEW YEARS AGO I WAS ONE OF THE MANY NOT LEGISLATORS IN THE PAST TO TRY TO CHANGE THIS LAW. BECAUSE EVERY YEAR OVER FORTY TWO THOUSAND AMERICANS ARE KILLED IN TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS. AND SPEED IS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR IN 31% OF ALL FATAL ACCIDENTS AND ALL TRAFFIC FATALITIES. WE KNOW THAT SPEED KILLS AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT IT WAS EVEN A 5% FOR A FIVE MILE AN HOUR REDUCTION IN SPEEDS. LEADS TO ACCIDENTS THAT ARE MUCH MORE SURVIVABLE. FOR PEOPLE IN CARS AND PEOPLE ON THE OUTSIDE OF CARS WHO ARE HIT. SO A FEW YEARS AGO WE PUT TOGETHER A VISION OF WHAT WAS CALLED THE VISION. ZERO TRAFFIC FATALITY TASK FORCE MADE UP OF STAKEHOLDERS FROM ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. FROM ALL OF OUR WALK BIKE GROUPS AND TRAFFIC SAFETY GROUPS AND THEY CAME UP AFTER A YEAR OF RIGOROUS WORK WITH A LIST OF RECOMMENDATIONS. AND REFORMING THE EIGHTY FIFTH PERCENTILE IS THAT SPEED LIMIT SETTING LAW IS CALLED WAS AT THE VERY TOP OF THEIR LIST. THIS BILL. IT WAS KEEN WAS BORN OUT OF CONSENSUS BY MANY DIFFERENT GROUPS. IT'S A VERY TARGETED APPROACH LOOKING AT THE EIGHTY FIFTH PERCENTILE ONLY. IN A HIGH ACCIDENT NETWORKS NEAR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS LIKE SCHOOLS AND SENIOR CENTERS AND REC CENTERS. AND WITH AN EYE TOWARDS GIVING ALL OF OUR JURISDICTION SOME FLEXIBILITY. AND THEIR CONSTANT PRESSURE TO HAVE TO RAISE SPEED LIMITS TO GIVE SOME MORE FLEXIBILITY TO CAPTURE EVEN LOWER SPEED LIMITS IN CERTAIN CASES. WITH AN EYE TOWARDS PUBLIC SAFETY. WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS BILL WITH ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS BUT IT'S A REALLY GOOD PLACE WITH A LOT OF CONSENSUS AMONG FROM EVEN FROM GROUPS THAT HAVE NOT SUPPORTED THESE EFFORTS IN THE PAST. AND WITHOUT I WOULD HUMBLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS FRIEDMAN MR FONG. YOUR RECOMMENDS. I THANK YOU MR SPEAKER MEMBERS. I RISE IN SUPPORT TODAY OF AB FORTY THREE. FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HER COMMITMENT TO KEEP. TO KEEPING OUR DRIVERS PEDESTRIANS AND ROAD SAFETY. SPEEDING INCREASES THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF VEHICLE CRASHES. AND IT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR OVER 25% OF TRAFFIC FATALITIES. SPEEDING RELATED FATALITIES ARE SURGING ACROSS THE NATION WITH MORE THAN SEVENTEEN PEDESTRIAN STRUCK AND KILLED ON OUR ROADS. EACH DAY. IN OUR DISTRICTS. THIS IS A GROWING ISSUE. AB FORTY THREE. GIVES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE FLEXIBILITY. TO SET THEIR OWN SPEED LIMITS REFLECT THE NEEDS OF DRIVERS PEDESTRIANS AND BUSINESSES ALIKE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. ABOUT AN EIGHTY FORTY THREE. THANK YOU MR FONG.
