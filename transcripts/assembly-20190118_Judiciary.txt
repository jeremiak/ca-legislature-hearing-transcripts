VOTES NEVER SHE'S BEEN HERE MANY TIMES IN OPPOSITION OR TO COULD BE HER DAY SHE'S ACTUALLY FROM ABORTION CLINIC. OFFERING HELP TO WOMEN AND SO. BECAUSE BURKE ON ON HER BEHALF AND SO THE MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. WE CAN ALL PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THIS VOTE. SOME WOULD SAY A WASTE OF TIME EVEN SPEAK. BUT THERE'S ALWAYS MERIT IN SPEAKING TRUTH TO POWER. YOU HAVE THE POWER AND WE ALL KNOW THE TRUTH. IN THE U. S. SIXTY MILLION LIVES HAVE BEEN KILLED BY ABORTION SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE IN SOME LIMÃ³N FOR A LIFETIME LEADING MANY TO SUFFER FROM DEPRESSION ANXIETY. PANIC ATTACKS NIGHTMARES. DRUG AND ALCOHOL ADDICTION AND THOUGHTS OF SUICIDE ESPECIALLY FOR WOMEN WHO ARE LIKE TO BUY THE ABORTION INDUSTRY TELLING THEM THAT WAS A CLUMP OF CELLS SOME TISSUE. YEAH WE KNOW THE TRUTH. EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM HAS HEARD THE HEARTBEAT OF A BABY WHICH STARTS AT TWENTY ONE DAYS. WE'VE ALL SEEN THE ULTRASOUND IMAGES. OF BABIES ARMS AND LEGS OF FACE NO DOUBT IN THE THE CHARITY AND I LOVE I HOPE THAT SOMEDAY EACH OF YOU WILL HAVE A CHANGE OF HEART. JUST LIKE JANE ROE OF ROE VERSUS WADE. HER REAL NAME IS NORMA MCCORVEY. WHO ACTUALLY NEVER HAD AN ABORTION IN LATER LIFE HAD A COMPLETE CHANGE OF HEART? BECOMING A PRO LIFE LEADER -- LATER IN LIFE ALONG SIDE OF FORMER ABORTIONIST IN NAY RALPH FOUNDER DOCTOR BERNARD NATHANSON. WHO PERFORMED OVER SIX SIXTY THOUSAND ABORTIONS IN HIS LIFETIME THE LABOR LATER WE CAN YOUR CALL AFTER THIS? THERE IS HOPE AND FORGIVENESS EVERYONE OF US SEEKS GOD'S MERCY. TO DATE THIS FIGHT THE POWERS AROUND ME I WILL NOT BE SILENT ABOUT THE MATTER OF ABORTION. WHICH DOCTOR BERNARD NATHANSON THE FOUNDER OF NAY RAVEL. CALLED THE MOST THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME IS AND GIVE ANYONE ELSE WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT SEEING NONE I WILL -- BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MAY I JUST HAVE A GROWN MAN AND I'M REALLY SORRY I SPENT MOST OF MY LIFE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE. ALSO HAVE OTHER ACCESS AND THEY DON'T HAVE QUESTIONS. AND I FIND THAT VERY SERIOUSLY. BUT WITH ALL OF YOUR COMMENTS ALSO TAKE SERIOUSLY TO YOU CALL AN ABORTION INDUSTRY. BECAUSE YOU TALK ABOUT -- BIRTH MOM TWO GENERATIONS AGO. BUT MISSED GENERATION I WAS THE YOUNG WOMAN OF COLOR WHO IS I'M MARRIED AND WALKED INTO A PLANNED PARENTHOOD WITH AN UNEXPECTED PREGNANCY. AND THAT PLANNED PARENTHOOD WHEN I SAID I HAD NO DOUBT THAT HAVE THAT CHILD. OFFERED TO LET ME HEAR THE HEART BEAT. THAT'S NOT AN ABORTION INDUSTRY THAT IS CARING INDIVIDUALS TO ENSURE WORK THE SAFETY AND PARENTHOOD HAVE FAMILY PLANNING AVOID ABORTIONS AT ALL COSTS BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO HAVE ABORTIONS I DON'T THINK ANYONE WANTS PEOPLE TO HAVE A QUESTION I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT. ABORTION INDUSTRY TITLE EVEN COMES FROM ITS OFFENSES IT'S DEEPLY OFFENSIVE. BECAUSE MY MOM IN THE SAME YEAR SO YOUR TALK ABOUT YOUR MOTHER WORKING EMERGENCY ROOM WHEN BEFORE WE WENT. AND THE STORY SHE TELLS ABOUT YOUNG WOMEN WHO CAME IN WITH POSH ABORTIONS THAT YOU'LL NOT ONLY THE BIG THE BABY IS HIGHER BUT THE GIRLS YOURSELF. THOSE ARE MY SKILLS. AND WHAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED IN THE HIGH SEAS ESPECIALLY HOW CALIFORNIA WILL READ VALUE THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN TO TO HELPING THE COMMUNITY IS THE APPOINTED SUBJECT. AND I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING. AND I THINK WE COULD WORK TOGETHER IF WE GOT PASSED SOME OF THE JUST REVIEWED RHETORIC AND BIGGER OUT HOW WE CAN SUPPORT YOUR MOM TO MAKE THAT CHOICE HAVE CHILD ESPECIALLY THOSE WERE UNSUPPORTED AND I MERRY. AND WE SO SELDOM GET THIS KIND OF PASSION ABOUT THAT. AND INSTEAD WORK TOGETHER TO FIGURE OUT ALSO HOW WOMEN HAVE ACCESS. TO MANY INTEL UNEXPECTEDLY. SO I I THINK YOU FOR FOR YOUR HEARTFELT TESTIMONY BUT I ALSO WANTED TO TO THANK THE PEOPLE WHO CAME HERE COMPANIES. BECAUSE ARE NOT AN OPTION INDUSTRY. CARING INDIVIDUALS WHO CARE FOR WOMEN IN KEEP THEM IN STATE POSITIONS OF MAKING PROGRAMS RESOLUTION FLAT. I WAS ABLE TO SECOND AT THIS IS ALSO THE QUESTIONS COMMENTS WAS GALLAGHER. FOR THE SAME THE ONE ITEM ACTUALLY AGREEING THAT I HAVE TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW I THINK WHEN YOU GET PASS PLANNING OUR FLAGS ON EACH SIDE WHERE WE DISAGREE AND I THINK THE FUNDAMENTAL WHY THIS IS STILL AN ISSUE. IS WE NEVER RECONCILE THE RIGHTS OF THE UNBORN CHILD -- NEON SO ALSO AS A HUSBAND WHO WATCHES WIFE GO THROUGH THREE HIGHWAYS FOR HIGH RISK PREGNANCIES -- AND WAS THERE AT SEVENTEEN WEEKS WHEN THEY'RE AT UCSF WHEN THEY WERE DOING AN ECHO CARDIOGRAM ON THEIR TEAMS. MY TWINS TO BE HEARTS. THERE CLEARLY IS SOMETHING HERE THAT WE HAVE TO RECONCILE THAT THERE. THERE IS ANOTHER LIFE YOU'RE ALSO THIS A WOMAN'S LIFE AND IS ALSO. AN UNBORN CHILD -- AND SO I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT I WHERE I WANT TO SAY IS I THINK LIKE INSTEAD OF US LIKE CONTINUE TO PLANT FLAGS AND DO. RESOLUTIONS -- LET'S HAVE A DISCUSSION HOW WE CAN DO BETTER FOR BUT HOW CAN WE DO BETTER FOR WOMEN IN A CRISIS PREGNANCY. AND HOW CAN WE RECOGNIZE THE RIGHT SET OF OF THE ON BOARD -- IT SHOULD BE A CHOICE BETWEEN. THOSE WHO ARE WANTED WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO SAVE. YEAH YEAH SO I THINK THAT'S ATTENTION AS WE CONTINUE. TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE BUT IT'S BETTER TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS I THINK. YOU KNOW THAN -- AND WHAT YOU CAN SEE MAYBE ON THE THE POLARIZING -- SO WITH THAT. THANK YOU OTHER. COMMENTS QUESTIONS ALRIGHT THANK YOU THIS THE MYT FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD FROM MY STANDPOINT. I THINK THAT. WE DO IN FACT AND EVERY WOMAN I HAVE TALKED TO WHO HAS CONTEMPLATED ARE GONE THROUGH. THIS ISSUE TAKES IT VERY SERIOUSLY AND DOESN'T FACT CONSIDER. THE LIFE OF THE CHILD THAT SHE'S CARING IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT IT'S A VERY EMOTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCE [inaudible] BUT FROM A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE HER BODY. HER ABILITY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO AND ALL WILL BE WEEK REALLY DOES WHICH IS WHITE SO WORTH. SUPPORTING IS PROVIDE THAT OPTION. OR A REAL OPTION WITHOUT GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION THAT'S WERE WE THE RATE. THE WAY IT STANDS. FOR BECAUSE IT IS A WOMAN'S. CHOICE. IN HER CIRCUMSTANCE TO DO WHAT SHE FEELS IS BEST. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING FORWARD WE DO HAVE A MOTION TO HAVE THE SECOND TO THE MOTION IS THAT THE H. R. SIX BE ADOPTED -- THIS LOAD THE CLOTHES. I RESPECT. ALL OF THE COMMENTS. ON THAT HAVE BEEN MADE I I THINK THAT THEY ARE IMPORTANT COMMENTS AND PART OF THE DISCUSSION. BUT CERTAINLY -- YOU KNOW IN IN WHAT'S BEEN SAID I ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT SHOWS WE STARTED TO SEE WOMEN. GO TO BACK ALLEYS WE STARTED TO HEAR ABOUT A HANGER MATHIS AND I WASN'T CLEAR WITHOUT LESS. SO THE REALITY IS. THAT FOR SO MANY WOMEN IN THIS COUNTRY. THEY HAVE TO PURSUE OTHER OPTIONS I HAVE YET TO DATE TO MEET ANY WOMAN WHO SAYS IN MY FACE WHO LOOKS ME IN THE EYES WHO I KNOW OF THAT SAYS I WANT AN ABORTION. THIS IS A DIFFICULT DECISION. AND ONE THAT THEY MAKE. WITH DOCTORS. WITH ORGANIZATIONS LIKE PLANNED PARENTHOOD. AND I APPRECIATE WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ HAS SHARED BECAUSE I'VE HEARD THAT OVER AND OVER A WOMEN WHO DO WALK. INTO CLINICS AND CENTERS AND SAY I'VE GOT THE MOST OBJECTIVE INFORMATION TO MAKE THAT DECISION. AND THE REASON FOR THIS RESOLUTION. IS NOT. TO OVER POLITICIZING ISSUE IT IS TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT WOMEN REMEMBER WE HAVE A RIGHT. AND THIS IS A LONG FOUGHT RIGHT TO MAKE THAT CHOICE. DO YOU HAVE AN OPINION THAT IS RESPECTED. AND THAT IS YOUR CHOICE IS THE MONEY YOU NEED TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE. I ALSO THINK THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO RESPECT EVERYONE AND ABILITY TO MAKE THIS CHOICE HERSELF. AND FOR THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I HAVE A THANK YOU. STONE BY STONE AYE MAIENSCHEIN.
