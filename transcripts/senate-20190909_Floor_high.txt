PASS ON FILE FILE ITEM ONE SEVENTY FOUR SENATOR JACKSON'S. MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ ASSEMBLY BILL FOUR THREE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA AN ACT REALLY INTO EMPLOYMENT SENATE JACKSON THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES THIS MEASURE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA INCREASES THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR FILING A WORKER RETALIATION CLAIM FROM SIX MONTHS TO TWO YEARS AND ADDS THE ABILITY TO SYNC ATTORNEY'S FEES FOR PREVAILING EMPLOYEES. WE KNOW WORKPLACE RETALIATION OCCURS WHEN EMPLOYERS DOES CHARGE THREATEN TO DISCHARGE TO MODE SUSPEND OR SUBJECT EMPLOYEES TO AN ADVERSE EMPLOYMENT ACTION FOR EXERCISING THEIR RIGHTS UNDER THE LABOR CODE FORMS OF RETALIATION CAN RANGE FROM SUBTLE WORKPLACE INTIMIDATION. OUTRIGHT THREATS SUCH AS THREATENING DEPORTATION. RETALIATION IS NOT ONLY PERVASIVE BUT ALSO A GROWING PROBLEM DUE TO THE CURRENT POLITICAL CLIMATE SURROUNDING IMMIGRATION. IN FACT IN ITS TWENTY SEVENTEEN RETALIATION COMPLAINT REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE THE LABOR COMMISSIONER REPORTED A DOUBLING OF THE NUMBER OF RETALIATION COMPLAINT BASED UPON SEX RACE OR ETHNICITY FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR. IMMIGRATION RELATED WORKPLACE RETALIATION ESPECIALLY SAW A SIGNIFICANT UPTAKE FROM TWENTY CASES IN TWENTY SIXTEEN TO NINETY FIVE CASES IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. IF AN EMPLOYEE HAS A STRONG CLAIM. OFTENTIMES THE BURDEN OF PAYING ATTORNEYS FEES CAN BE A DETERRENT FOR AN AGGRIEVED WORKER. ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE IN LOW WAGE POSITIONS. THREE YEARS AGO THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED AS BEING THAT NINETY SIX INTO LAW WHICH AUTHORIZES THE COURT TO AWARD REASONABLE ATTORNEY'S FEES FROM THE EMPLOYER IF THE LABOR COMMISSIONER PREVAILS THIS BILL SIMPLY BUILDS UPON THAT MEASURE BY PROVIDING THE SAME RIGHT TO PRIVATE ATTORNEYS. WHO TAKE THESE RETALIATION CASES OFTEN ON A PRO BONO BASIS ON BEHALF OF WORKERS WITH MORE TME TO FILE AB FOUR OH THREE STRENGTHENS THE LEGAL RIGHTS OF WHISTLE BLOWERS WHO FACE RETALIATION. AND ESPECIALLY HELPS LOWER WAGE WORKERS ATTAIN LEGAL REPRESENTATION WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU CENTER JACKSON MEMBERS ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE CENTER STONE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE AND OPPOSE AB FOUR OH THREE. I HAD THE PLEASURE OF BEING AT THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION OF THE WEEKEND AND HEARD FROM THE FORMER GOVERNOR OF TEXAS RICK PERRY. WHO TALK ABOUT HOW EASY PICKINGS CALIFORNIA WAS TO TAKE BUSINESSES OUT OF CALIFORNIA. AND BRING ON THE TAXES OF ONE OF THOSE ISSUES WAS BECAUSE OUR TOWARD SITUATION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. INSTEAD OF REQUESTING AND HAVING THOSE AT THE BEEN AGGRIEVED BY THEIR EMPLOYERS TO QUICKLY STAND UP AND MAKE ISSUE WHETHER BE LEGAL OR OTHERWISE ABOUT A- JOB RELATED ISSUE. THIS IS GOING TO FURTHER EXACERBATE ARE TOWARD SITUATION INSTEAD CALIFORNIA BUT REALLY IS WHAT I WOULD CALL ON BALANCE. ON BALANCE JUSTICE BECAUSE OF YOUR PLAINTIFF AND YOU PREVAIL YOU'RE GUARANTEED TO GET YOUR ATTORNEY FEES PAID BUT- IF YOU'RE A DEFENDANT AND YOU PREVAIL. THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU CAN PREVAIL IS A SHOW THAT THE CLAIM WAS FRIVOLOUS SO THIS IS UNBALANCED AGAIN IN THE FAVOR OF. THOSE THAT WISH TO SEE DEEP POCKETS OF EMPLOYERS FOR SOME FRIVOLOUS CLAIMS SOME LEGITIMATE CLAIM TO WE SHOULD UNLESS WE EVEN THE PLAYING FIELD LET'S HAVE THE DEFENDANT ATTORNEYS IF THEY PREVAIL TO BE ABLE TO GET ATTORNEY FEES FROM THOSE THAT ARE FINDING CASES AGAINST THEM. SO AGAIN CALIFORNIA REMAINS BUSINESS UNFRIENDLY WE CONTINUE THAT MANTRA COLLEAGUES WE MAY NOT FEEL THE EFFECTS OF BUSINESS FLEEING TE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TODAY BUT I ASSURE YOU WITHIN FIVE YEARS YOU ARE GOING TO SEE. A DECREASE IN OUR REVENUES A DECREASE IN JOBS AND EXACERBATIONS OF ARE HOMELESS ISSUES THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND YOU OWN IT FOR THOSE REASONS I REJECT AB EIGHT FOUR THREE WORSE ENERGY TO VOTE NO. THANK YOU CENTER STILL MEMBERS ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SEEING NONE THERE JACKSON WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU I CHOSE TO ADDRESS ONE ISSUE IF WE START SEEING A REDUCTION IN THE INCOMES FROM THE INCOME OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT IS CLEARLY DUE TO THE POLICIES OF THIS CAR WHITE HOUSE THAT SINGLE CELL CALIFORNIA TO TRY DO EVERYTHING IT CAN TO UNDERMINE OUR STRONG ECONOMY SO THAT ARGUMENT IS JUST ABSOLUTELY. INCORRECT AND DOT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW IS PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF EMPLOYEES CURRENTLY THE LABOR COMMISSIONER HAS THE RIGHT TO SEEK ATTORNEY'S FEES ARE NOT MANDATORY BUT THEY ARE AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST AN APPLICATION TO THE COURT. THIS BILL IS AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE SURE THAT EMPLOYERS BEHAVE THE WAY THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO. THIS ISN'T TAKING GOOD PEOPLE AND PUNISHING THEM FOR DOING THE RIGHT THING THIS IS TAKING EMPLOYERS WHO DO THE WRONG THING WHO VIOLATE LABOR LAWS TO TRY TO RETALIATE AGAINST THEIR EMPLOYEES WHO TRY TO ASSERT THEIR RIGHTS THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT WE REALIZE. THAT WE NEED TO EXTEND THE STATUTE BECAUSE OF SIX MY. KINDS OF COMPLAINTS AND CANNOT FULLY DO. THAT KIND OF WORK IN A PROPER AN EXPEDITIOUS WAY ALLOWING A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION TO THE EXTENT THEY PREVAIL IF THEY DON'T PREVAIL. NOBODY GETS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK ATTORNEY'S FEES BUT IF THEY DO PREVAIL THEY WOULD BE ENTITLED TO THOSE FEES IT'S JUST ANOTHER WAY TO PROTECT WORKERS. WHO TRY TO ASSERT THEIR RIGHTS UNDER WHICH WE THROUGH OUR LAWS HAVE pRESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ALLEN. I ARCHULETA. I ATKINS.

MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE SEVENTY ONE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER POLAND RELATING TO THE POLITICAL FORM ACT OF NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR. SENATOR ALLEN THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND SENATORS CALIFORNIA'S ONE OF A FEW STATES TO HAVE CITY KIND CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION LIMITS. BUT NO LOCAL CONTRIBUTION LIMITS TO THIS MEANS THAT UNLESS LOCAL GOVERNMENT ADOPTED TONE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION LIMITS LITERALLY ANY AMOUNT TO BE CONTRIBUTED DIRECTLY TO A CANDIDATE FOR LOCAL OFFICE. THIS IS KIND TO RIDICULOUS PROPORTIONS IN SOME PLACES WE'VE SEEN EXAMPLES OF CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS RECEIVING DIRECT CONTRIBUTIONS FROM A SINGLE DONOR THAT ARE AS HIGH AS A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. IN A SMALL CITY. PROVISIONS OF THIS MAGNITUDE UNDERMINE PUBLIC TRUST IN DEMOCRACY THIS BILL DOES VERY SIMPLE THING IT ESTABLISHES A DEFAULT CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION LIMIT. AT THE SAME LEVEL THAT WE HAVE HERE AT THE STATE. FOR THOSE COUNTIES AND CITIES THAT HAVE NOT ADOPTED THEIR OWN LIMITS. AND SO BUT I WILL SAY THIS MAINTAINS COMPLETE LOCAL CONTROL SO IF IT ANY POINT LOCAL JURISDICTION WANTS TO OPT OUT BY ENACTING ITS OWN CONTRIBUTION LIMITS WITH THE LOWER HIGHER THAN THE DEFAULT THEY CAN THEY CAN DO THAT. BUT THE WHAT WHAT THIS DOES INSTEAD OF SETTING THE DEFAULT AS THERE BEING NO CONTRIBUTION LIMITS HE SAYS WE OUGHT TO SET THE DEFAULT AT THE STATE LEVEL FOR THE LEGISLATORS AND THEN THE JURISDICTION CAN GO LOWER HIGHER IF THEY WANT TO. THIS A GOOD GOVERNANCE MEASURE IT SUPPORTED BY ALL THE GOOD GOVERNMENT GROUPS AND I RESPECT FOR NAY VOTE ASK FOR A VOTE THANK YOU CENTER ALLEN MEMBERS DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR PORCHES. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I ACTUALLY. SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL A DISTILLATION IN MY FORMER CAPACITY AS A SUPERVISOR I HAD TO PUT FORWARD A PIECE LEGISLATION THAT DEALT WITH TERM LIMITS AND CONTRIBUTION LIMITS. NEITHER OF WHICH WERE RECEIVED FAVORABLY MY DAD BUT THE IDEA THAT WE HAVE SOME UNIFORMITY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA GOING FROM THE LOCAL ON UP TO THE STATE I THINK IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT THE RIGHT DIRECTION THERE'S A TON OF DISPARITY. BOB FROM ONE JURISDICTION TO THE NEXT AND I SUPPORT. LOCAL CONTROL IN THIS COMPROMISE LEGISLATION ALLOWS FOR A BASS LINE TO EXIST BUT LOCAL ENTITIES TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS. SHOULD THEY WISH TO SO I THINK THIS IS A SMART MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU SENATOR BORDERS MEMBERS ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. JONES THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL AND I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR AT HAVING THE LOCAL CONTROL ASPECT OF IT IN THERE BUT- I JUST FEEL LIKE SOME OF THE REGULATIONS ALREADY UNDER THE A FEW PC CONTROL AND THE LOCAL CONTROL REGARDING. CONTRIBUTION LIMITS ARE REALLY INCUMBENT PROTECTION TOOLS BECAUSE AS AN INCUMBENT HI YOU WE'VE GOT ACCESS TO STAFF AND CAMPAIGN FOLKS TO HELP US COMPLY. WITH ALL THESE RULES AND REGULATIONS WERE AS SOMEBODY WHO'S LOOKING AT GETTING INVOLVED IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS AS A BEGINNER AS A NEW PERSON RUNNING FOR OFFICE. THEY'RE VERY CONVOLUTED THEY'RE HARD TO UNDERSTAND IT'S EASY TO MAKE A MISTAKE AND I THINK THAT THAT'S ADDS TO THAT. AND FOR THAT REASON I'LL BE VOTING NO THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR JONES SAWYER STONE. THE PRESIDENT I ALSO RISE IN OPPOSITION AB FIVE SEVENTY ONE COMING FROM THE COUNTY WHERE WE'RE STILL KIND OF THE WILD WEST OF POLITICS IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY WE DON'T HAVE TERM LIMITS WE DON'T HAVE CAMPAIGN FINANCE LIMITS. WHEN I RAN FOR SUPERVISOR OF RIVERSIDE COUNTY THE FOURTH LARGEST COUNTY IN THE STATE THE TENTH LARGEST COUNTY IN THE COUNTRY I RAN AGAINST AN ENTRENCHED INCUMBENT IN A COUNTY WHERE AN INCUMBENT HAD BEEN BE IN THIRTY SEVEN YEARS. NOW IF YOU HAVE. LIMITS THAT ARE PLACED UPON THOSE THAT ARE TRYING TO CHALLENGE THE STATUS QUO. THAT'S GONNA BE VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE INCOME AND ESPECIALLY A SUPERVISOR HAS A VAST ARRAY OF HIGH. DOLLAR CONTRIBUTORS NAMELY DEVELOPERS. AND SO FOR ME TO RUN FOR COUNTY SUPERVISOR I CAN TELL YOU THAT A LOT OF FOLKS THOUGHT I DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE BECAUSE THEY CLAIM THAT WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO RAISE ENOUGH MONEY BUT THROUGH A STRONG GRASSROOTS CAMPAIGN AND YES. SOME DONORS AND WANTED TO SEE A HIGHER QUALITY OF LIFE AND RIVERSIDE COUNTY I RECEIVED SOME LARGER CONTRIBUTIONS STILL. NOT MATCHING WITH THE INCOME AND SUPERVISOR HAD. I WOULD SAY THAT WORKING ON THE GROUND WALKING TWENTY THOUSAND HOMES PROBABLY HAD A STRONG. AFFECT ON MY ABILITY TO PREVAIL IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY AND SO. I ALSO AGREE THAT THIS IS NOTHING MORE THAN AN IN COMBAT PROTECTIVE MEASURE LET THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES. WHAT THEY SHOULD DO WITH REGARD TO ANY CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION LIMITS THAT THEY WANT TO EMBRACE ANY AT ALL ONE THING WE DON'T LIKE FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO MANY OF US CAME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT. I WHEN WE OF THE LEGISLATURE TELL THEM HOW THEY HAVE TO RUN THEIR MUNICIPALITIES IT'S VERY OFFENSIVE AND FOR THOSE REASONS I URGE A NO VOTE IN SB FIVE. SEVEN ONE. YOU CENTER SO MEMBERS ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SEEING AND HEARING NONE SENATOR ALAN JULY TO CLOSE. FOR MEMBERS HI. THIS BILL DOES NOT TELL THEM WHAT TO DO IT IF HE DID ABSOLUTELY PRESERVES THE LOCALITIES ABILITY. TO CHANGE THE DEFAULT RIGHT NOW THE DEFAULT IS THERE'S AN UNLIMITED THERE'S NO LIMIT. ALL THIS AS IT SHOULD FOR THE DEFAULT IS BUT THEY CAN GO AHEAD AND CROSS WHATEVER POLICY THE ONE. OF MY ONE KINDOF QUESTION FOR YOU IS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT BIG DEVELOPERS GETTING INVOLVED WITH RACES. THEY'RE THE ONES WHO ARE THE MOST LIKELY TO STEP UP WITH THE KINDS OF CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WOULD BLOW OUR CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION LIMITS ON THE WATER. ME TELL YOU THIS IS THIS IS THE PRECISELY WHY THE KINDS OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE BEHIND THIS BILL ARE BEHIND THIS BILL. THE CALIFORNIA CLEAN MONEY CAMPAIGN. CALIFORNIA COMMON CAUSE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS FAIR POLITICAL PRACTICES COMMISSION LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA. REPRESENT US THESE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE NOT IN THE INCUMBENT PROTECTION BUSINESS THESE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE IN THE GOOD GOVERNMENT BUSINESS.

SOME OF THE NINE SIXTY FIVE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MARK STONE AND TACKLING A PAROLE. SENATOR WIENER I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES AB NINE SIXTY FIVE. BY WILL AUTHORIZE THE SECRETARY OF C. C. R. TO ALLOW ANY CREDIT EARNED UNDER PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN. TO BE APPLIED TO INCARCERATED PERSONS EARLIEST POP POSSIBLE YOU'VE PAROLE HEARING DATE. THIS WILL ALLOW INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY SIX AT THE TIME OF THEIR CONTROLLING OFFENSE. TO BENEFIT FROM THE OPPORTUNITIES PROVIDED UNDER PROP FIFTY SEVEN AND WOULD INCREASE INCENTIVES FOR PEOPLE PARTICIPATE AND REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING. PROP FIFTY SEVEN CREATED OPPORTUNITIES FOR INCARCERATED PEOPLE TO EARN SENTENCE REDUCING CREDIT FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR. AND COMPLETION OF EDUCATIONAL AND REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS. EARNING CREDITS HELPS INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS RETAIN HOPE IN THE FACE OF LENGTHY SENTENCES AND INCENTIVIZE THEM TO FOCUS ON REHABILITATION. RECOGNIZING THAT MANY YOUNG PEOPLE ARE VICTIMS OF EXTREME SENTENCING AND THE YOUTH HAVE LESS OF AN ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR ACTION AND RESIST THEIR IMPULSES. THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HAS WORKED OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS THE GRANT EARLIER PAROLE HEARING DATES TO YOUTHFUL OFFENDERS. UNFORTUNATELY EXISTING LAW PREVENTS YOUTH OF THAT YOUTHFUL OFFENDERS FROM WRITING CREDITS OFF THEIR NEW PAROLE HEARING DATE WHICH UNDERMINES THE PURPOSE OF PROP FIFTY SEVEN. OPEN AND CENTER FOR REHABILITATION THAT PROPERTY SEVEN CREATED. THOSE CREDITS ARE JUST AS IMPORTANT TO YOUTH OF YOUTHFUL OFFENDERS AS THEY ARE TO THE REST OF THE PRISON POPULATION. AND IT'S WRONG TO EXCLUDE THEM FOR BENEFITING FROM THE CREDITS SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THEIR AGE I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVAL. THANK YOU SENATOR WIENER MEMBERS. DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE SENATOR HILLS. MADAM PRESIDENT LADIES DONE THE SENATE ONE OF THE IRONIES WITH GOOD TIME CREDIT. THERE REALLY ISN'T AND HASN'T BEEN EARNED. IT'S BEEN AN AUTOMATIC SENTENCE REDUCTION FOR DECADES. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO COMPLETE PROGRAMS AND DOING SO YOU HAVE TO AND THEN IF YOU ARE A REALLY SERIOUS OFFENDER AS WOULD BE THE PROP FIFTY SEVEN CROWD MURDER FIRST MURDER SECOND KIDNAPPED. THREE STRIKERS AMONG OTHERS. YOU HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE SOME COMPREHENSION AND ABILITY TO APPLY THE LESSONS THAT YOU LEARNED IN THE TREATMENT THAT YOU SUPPOSEDLY. WENT TO AND WE'RE DEDICATED TO. THAT IS ONE OF THE IRONIES THAT THE- GOOD TIME. HAS NEVER REALLY BEEN REQUIRED TO BE EARNED. NOW WE WERE TOLD THAT ONLY THE WORST OF THE WORST WE'RE GONNA. HAVE TO STAY IN PRISON. WELL PROP FIFTY SEVEN CHANGED ALL OF THAT. THE VERY SERIOUS CRIMES THAT I SPOKE TO ARE ONES FOR WHICH PROP FIFTY SEVEN THE PRICE. AND THERE'S ANOTHER IRONY HERE. SEVERAL YEARS AGO. THE LEGISLATURE CHANGED. THE NUMBER OF YEARS A LIFE IN MATE WITH POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE COULD BE DENIED SUITABILITY CONSIDERATION. FORMALLY AT BEST IT WAS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF MURDERS THAT YOU COMMITTED. ONE MURDER YOU CAN ONLY BE DONE I TWO YEARS BEFORE YOU CAN BE CONSIDERED AGAIN. THREE OR MORE FIVE YEARS. WE CHANGED IT TO BE FIVE YEARS. FOR ANYBODY. BUT PUT A PROVISION IN THE BILL. AND THAT WAS MY OWN DOING IS CHAIR OF THE BOARD PRISON TERMS I SOUGHT THIS BECAUSE I FELT THAT THIS WOULD HELP THAT STATUTE PREVAIL. LEGAL CHALLENGES. WHICH IT DID BEFORE THE US SUPREME COURT. THE PROVISION SAID THAT AFTER THREE YEARS. ON A FIVE YEAR DENIAL. THE IN MAY. COULD APPLY IT TO THE BOARD. FOR A HEARING SOONER THAN THE FIVE YEARS. IF THEY HAD DEMONSTRATED AN EXAMPLE RAY PERFORMANCE IN THE REHABILITATIVE AFTER. LATER THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. CHANGE THAT TO FIFTEEN YEARS. MAXIMUM THE NILE. OF SUITABILITY. IT MADE ATTORNEYS GOT REALLY CREATIVE WITH THAT THOUGH. AND LET THAT MATURE IN PROP FIFTY SEVEN WHERE BY ALMOST EVERY YEAR NO MATTER HOW MANY YEAR DENIAL YOU RECEIVE. THE INMATES ARE COMING BACK. FOR HEARINGS MUCH SOONER. SO ONE WHO WOULD TO BE DESERVING OF A FIVE YEAR DENIAL AND EIGHT YEAR DENIAL A FIFTEEN YEAR TO DIAL. IS BACK IN THREE YEARS. FOR CONSIDERATION AGAIN. FOR THE SEVERITY AND SERIOUSNESS OF THE CRIMES THAT THEY COMMIT. THAT'S NOT A LONG AND SUSTAINED REHABILITATIVE PERIOD OF TIME. LIFE IN MAKES OF ALWAYS BEEN DEEMED THE SAFEST TO RETURN TO SOCIETY. THAT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY WERE SAFE INMATES NECESSARILY AND IT'S BECAUSE THEY HAVE SIMPLY SERVE MORE TIME. AND FINALLY GOT IT. THAT THEY NEEDED TO DO SOME REHABILITATION THEY HAD TO STAY OUT OF TROUBLE AND WHETHER INCARCERATED NOT A TRUE ONE FIFTEEN TO ONE TWENTY EIGHT WHICH IS THE DEFINITION OF A DEATH DISCIPLINARY BEHAVIOR. AGAIN. THE SUN THE BATTLE ISSUE. HAS THEY HAVE THEY RETAIN THEMSELVES. IN TREATMENT IN REHABILITATION SUFFICIENTLY TO GET. AND NOT JUST AN AUTOMATIC FREE TICKET OUT EVERY TIME WE'VE CHANGED AGAIN IN THE MID EIGHTIES GOOD TIME CREDIT WAS EIGHTIES WAS CHANGED. YOUR SERIOUS AND VIOLENT CONTROLLING CASE SERIOUS AND VIOLENT. YOU ONLY GOT 15% GOOD TIME CREDIT. WASN'T MUCH JOURNEY EITHER. AND THEN THAT WAS CHANGED BACK EVERYBODY GETS 50% GOOD TIME. ONE THING THAT THAT MOST ASSURE FOR EARLY DOES IT DENIES THE CRIME VICTIMS. AND THEIR FAMILIES. WHO GRIEVE OVER THE LOSS OF A LOVED ONE OR SUFFERED AT THE HANDS OF A SERIOUS REPEAT OFFENDER. IT DENIES THEM THE ONLY THING SOCIETY CAN PROVIDE THAT. NOT CLOSURE THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS CLOSURE. THERE IS ONLY JUSTICE. AND JUSTICE MADE JUST DESSERTS THE SEVERITY OF THE CRIME COMMITTED AGAINST INDIVIDUALS. AND AGAINST SOCIETY. I ARGUE MODE MIL FURTHER IN THIS DIRECTION. WE'VE BEEN HEADED. IN DENYING. JUSTICE TO CRIME VICTIMS. THANK YOU CENTER NIELSEN MEMBERS ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I JUST STAND. AS THE TEAR PUBLIC SAFETY WHO AND THE PUBLIC SAFETY BUDGET COMMITTEE WHERE WE HAVE NOT ONLY OVERSIGHT HEARINGS ON THESE ISSUES OF THE REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS IN OUR STATE FACILITIES WE ALSO VETS ALL OF THE BUDGETARY ISSUES RELATED TO IT. AND WHAT WE HEARD FROM OUR COLLEAGUE FROM TEHAMA WAS THAT. OUR PROGRAMS ARE REALLY REHABILITATIVE AND THAT WE GIVE PEOPLE CREDITS FOR REALLY NERVOUS FOR DOING NOTHING IN EFFECT. WHILE CERTAINLY DURING THE DEPTHS OF THE RECESSION. BECAUSE OF BUDGET CUTS MANY MANY OF THE VERY IMPORTANT REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS SUCH AS G. E. D. PROGRAMS ODD DRUG COUNSELING SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT AND OTHERS WERE CUT OR ELIMINATED FROM OUR SYSTEM THOSE HAVE BEEN RESTORED AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE IN WORKING THROUGH OUT OUR STATE PRISONS AND FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE BOTH HAD OVERSIGHT HEARINGS AND TOURED MANY OF THESE PRISON FACILITIES WE SEE THAT THESE PROGRAMS OR ROBUST. THEY'VE BEEN EVALUATED AND THEY'RE HAVING BENEFICIAL IMPACTS SOMEONE TO CORRECT THE RECORD ON THE NOTION THAT SOMEHOW THESE CREDITS ARE BEING GIVEN TO PEOPLE FOR WHOM THERE THE THERE'S BEEN NO GOOD BEHAVIOR SHOWN OR NO REAL PARTICIPATION IN SUBSTANTIVE OR QUALITY REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS I WOULD FINALLY NOTE THE CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO HAVE THE HIGHEST PERCENT. AND THIS IS POINT BASED ON OUR TOTAL PRISON POPULATION AS COMPARED TO OTHER STATES WE HAVE THE HIGHEST PERCENT OF PRISONERS SENTENCED EITHER AS ADULTS OR JUVENILES WHO ARE SERVING LIFE SENTENCES THAT IS HIGHER. THAN GEORGIA. IN SYLVANIA FLORIDA AND MICHIGAN FOR EXAMPLE THIS IS A NEEDED BILL AND I URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER SKINNER MEMBERS FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SEEING AND HEARING NONE SENATOR WIENER WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I'D JUST TO CLARIFY A FEW THINGS FIRST OF ALL THE FOCUS HERE IS NOT A GOOD TIME CREDITS AS WAS. DISCUSSED EARLIER IT'S EDUCATIONAL CREDITS IN CCAR'S BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT THOUGHT WILL BE THE FOCUS EDUCATIONAL CREDITS OF THIS CREATES AN INCENTIVE FOR THESE INMATES TO ENGAGE IN EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS. GET THEIR LIFE BACK TOGETHER SO THAT THEY CAN RE INTEGRATE. INTO SOCIETY I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO NOT LOSE SIGHT. THAT THIS IS NOT ABOUT AUTOMATIC PAROLE THIS IS ABOUT ELIGIBILITY FOR A HEARING. ELIGIBILITY SIMPLY TO MAKE YOUR CASE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN REHABILITATED IT AND THAT YOU SHOULD BE PAROLED ALLOWING THAT TO HAPPEN A BIT EARLIER WHEN SOMEONE COMMITTED THE CRIME. IT IN THEIR USE THAT'S ALL THIS IS ABOUT ALL I KNOW IT'S THE SAME PROCESS SUPPLIES AND IN TERMS OF VICTIMS BEING ABLE TO PARTICIPATE AND SO FORTH. AND THIS MAKES ALL THE SENSE IN THE WORLD IN THE ENDS AS THE CENTER FOR BERKELEY EACH HAS MENTIONED AS PROGRESSIVE AS WE LIKE TO THINK WE ARE SOMETIMES IN CALIFORNIA. OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM HAS BEEN ANYTHING BUT WE HAVE LED THE WAY IN MASS INCARCERATION WE HAVE LED THE WAY IN YOUTH INCARCERATION WE HAVE LED THE WAY IN OUR PRISON SYSTEM.

ASSEMBLY THE LEVIN SIXTY SIX BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER LEVINE AN ACT RELATING TO UNDERGROUND INFRASTRUCTURE SENATOR HILL THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN LEGISLATION OF MINE SB SIX SIXTY ONE CREATED THE DIG SAFE ACT WHICH INCLUDED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE DIG SAFE PORT. IN ADDITION TO ESTABLISHING THE DIG SAFE BOARD THE ACT REQUIRES A PERSON PLANNING TO CONDUCT AN EXCAVATION TO CONTACT THE APPROPRIATE REGIONAL NOTIFICATION CENTER PRIOR TO COMMENCING THE EXCAVATION. IT THEN REQUIRES OWNERS OF SUBSURFACE INSTALLATIONS AT ACT EXCAVATION SITES TO MARK THEIR UNDERGROUND INFRASTRUCTURE WITHIN TWO WORKING DAYS OF RECEIVING A NOTIFICATION. EVERY OPERATOR OF SUBSURFACE INSTALLATIONS IS REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE WITH THE REGIONAL NOTIFICATION CENTER HOWEVER A REPORT RELEASED EARLIER THIS YEAR BY THE CPUC FOUND THAT PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC. WOULD SOMETIMES RECORD THAT IT HAD REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH AN EXCAVATOR TO DELAY LOCATING AND MARKING PIPELINES WHEN IN REALITY IN EMPLOYEE HAD LEFT ONLY A VOICE MESSAGE OR MADE NO CONTACT AT ALL. THAT RAISE THE POSSIBILITY THAT CONSTRUCTION COULD BEGIN BEFORE A CREW KNEW WHERE THE PIPES WERE LOCATED. THE REPORT IDENTIFIED OVER WHAT OTHER WIDESPREAD INSTANCES IN WHICH P. JEANNIE PIPELINE LOCATION INFORMATION WAS FALSIFIED. THE FORMER P. UC COMMISSIONER CALLED THE REPORT'S FINDINGS DISCUSSED IN AND DEEPLY APPALLING. AB ELEVEN SIXTY SIX WOULD IMPROVE THE NOTIFICATION PROCESS REGARDING THE LOCATION OF SUBSURFACE PIPELINES BY REQUIRING UTILITIES TO PROVIDE AN ELECTRONIC POSITIVE RESPONSE. ON THE PIPE ONE LOCATION STATUS AT A SPECIFIC SITE BEFORE EXCAVATION CAN BEGIN CURRENTLY ELECTRONIC POSITIVE RESPONSES IS VOLUNTARY IN CALIFORNIA SB ELEVEN SIXTY SIX WOULD REQUIRE THIS RESPONSE WHICH MANY OTHER STATES ALREADY DO THERE'S NO OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE COLLEAGUES.

ASSEMBLY BILL TWO FIFTY SIX BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY AND ACKLAND WILDLIFE CENTER NIELSEN THEN PRESENTLADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE SENATE THIS BILL WILL EXPAND SO ON OF THE LONG ESTABLISHED PRACTICE AND WAS FORMALIZED IN LEGISLATION BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY. I BELIEVE YEAR AGO. THE PRACTICE IS TO FLOOD THE RICE FIELDS. IN THE FALL AFTER THE HARVEST. ALLOWING. MENDIS AMOUNTS OF EXPANDED HABITAT FOR A MIGRATING. BIRDS SPECIES. IT ALSO HAS ANOTHER IMPACT. RICE STRAW NOT THE COLONEL'S BUT THE STRAW. DOES NOT DECOMPOSE READILY IN THE SOIL BECAUSE OF THE HIGH SILICA. THINK BLACKS HIGH SILICA CONTENT. IF THE WATER IS UP ON AN OVER THAT END IN MORE IMPORTANTLY IF THE RICE STRAW I IN CONTACT WITH THE SOIL THAT DECOMPOSES MUCH MORE RAPIDLY. ANOTHER BIT OF AN IRONY WHEN THE MIGRATING BIRDS COME IN. AND THEY'RE FEEDING AND LIVING. ON THOSE RICE FIELDS. THEY ARE ACTUALLY PADDING DOWN. THE RICE STRAW SO THAT IT COMES IN CONTACT WITH THE SOIL. THEREBY ENHANCING THE DECOMPOSITION. THAT HAS BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY HELPFUL AS A TOOL FOR DECADES TO. GIVE US A ALTERNATIVE TO OPEN FEEL BURNING OF THE RICE. THE GREATEST BONE IS THE AMOUNT OF HABITAT THAT DOES PROVIDE FOR MY GRADING SPECIES. DRIVE UP AND DOWN THE VALLEY IN THE WINTER TIME IT'S A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT. TO SEE ALL OF THOSE BIRDS. OUT IN THOSE RICE FIELDS. VERY HAPPY AND CONTENT. BUT WHILE THEY ARE HAPPY AND CONTENT IT'S ALSO HELPING US. DISPOSE OF SOMETHING THAT USED TO BE A HUGE PROBLEM THIS PROVIDES SOME INCENTIVES. POLICE SHE FOR EXAMPLE WHO WERE BOY IF THEY ARE LEASING THAT LAND IT'S QUICKER AND EASIER FOR THEM. TO BE ABLE TO. SECURE THE RELEASE AND THEN GET AN APPROVAL. TO FLOOD THOSE FIELDS. THAT HELP. AND IT ENCOURAGES MORE LAND AND THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THIS ENCOURAGING MORE OPEN FEEL FLOODING.

MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ ASSEMBLY CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ONE THIRTY BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER RELATIVE TO AFRICAN DESCENDANTS OF SLAVES IN THE UNITED STATES. SENATOR BRADFORD THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT ACR ONE THIRTY ON BEHALF OF DOCTOR WHEREVER LOOKS TO ADDRESS. THE HISTORY OF CERTAIN SLAVERY HERE IN THIS COUNTRY THIS PAST AUGUST MARK FOUR HUNDRED YEARS SINCE THE FIRST AFTER AN AFGHAN WAS RIPPED FROM THEIR FAMILY THEIR HOMELAND AND BROUGHT TO UNITED STATES IN BONDAGE AS SLAVES. QUEEN SIXTEEN NINETEEN IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE FOUR MILLION AFRICANS AND THEIR DESCENDANTS WERE DE HUMANIZED DEPRIVED OF THEIR LIFE LIBERTY AND CULTURAL HERITAGE THE FACT REMAINS A BLOCK TODAY ARE STILL UNDERPAID. UNDEREMPLOYED UNDEREDUCATED OVER POLICED AN OPEL OVER REPRESENTED IN PRISONS AND JAILS THIS RESOLUTION SIMPLY RECOGNIZES THE HISTORY OF INJUSTICE THE BLOCKS OF INDOOR IN UNITED STATES. AND THE NEED FOR REPARATIONS REPARATIONS OUR BODY MELDING THE WRONGS OF SLAVERY IN THE WRONG OF CALIFORNIA ENGAGED BY ENABLING SLAVERY TO CONTINUE IN THIS STATE. CALIFORNIA'S LOOK TO AS A LEADER IN HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES AND TAKING A PROGRESSIVE STANCE AGAINST INJUSTICE BUT IT WAS CALIFORNIA THAT REFUSE TO PROVIDE ASYLUMS FOR FUGITIVE SLAVES AND PASS LAWS THAT PREVENT. FREAKS FREED SLAVES FROM LIVING HERE IN MY DISTRICT THERE IS A AREA. NOW KNOWN AS THE GUARDIAN A WETLANDS BUT IT WAS AFFECTIONATELY REFERRED TO AS THE **** SLOW. AND THE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS WERE AFTERNOON AFTERNOON FREE OUR PRINTS WRE FORCED TO LIVE ON LAND. THAT WAS UNABLE TO FARM OR BUILD HOUSING. REPARATIONS OUR ROOM READY TO THE ECONOMIC LEGAL POLITICAL AND EDUCATION AND JUST AS A STILL EXPERIENCE BY BLOCKS DESCENDANTS OF SLAVES TO THIS DAY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU SAID A RED FOR MEMBERS DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT I STAND PROBABLY IS A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS TO. OPENLY DECLARE MY SUPPORT FOR A C. R. AT ONE THIRTY. MEMBERS I NEED NOT TELL YOU OF THE HORRORS AND IN HUMANITY THE OLD AFRICANS AND COUNTLESS OTHERS IN MANY OF THEIR DESCENDANTS HAVE SINCE SPACE IN THIS COUNTRY. WE ALL KNOW THE INDISPUTABLE FACTS OF SLAVERY. OF BEING THREE FIFTHS OF A HUMAN OF JIM CROW OF SEGREGATION OF MASS INCARCERATION NEGLECT NEGLECTED COMMUNITIES OF A WAY TO GAPS EDUCATION GAPS AND HEALTH DISPARITIES. BUT THEY'VE CLEARLY NO NEED FOR ME TO GIVE YOU A BLACK HISTORY LESSON TODAY SO INSTEAD I WANNA REMIND US ALL OF OUR RESPONSIBILITY THE FIGHT FOR JUSTICE IN EQUITY FOR THE PEOPLE OF OUR GREAT STATE. ALL REMIND US ALL THAT AFTER FOUR HUNDRED YEARS OF AFTER AMERICAN HISTORY DISCRIMINATION AND JUSTICE IN INEQUALITY REMAINS FOR BLACK CALIFORNIANS IN ALL SECTORS OF LIFE IN POLICY. I WAS ASKED BY MANY PEOPLE IF I DIDN'T HAVE. BIGGER BROADER RESPONSIBILITIES IN TO CREATE LEGISLATION ON SOMETHING AS SEEMINGLY TRIVIAL AS HAIR. THAT'S JUST AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THE VERY POLITE THAT PLAGUE BLACK CALIFORNIANS DAILY LIVES ARE SO UNIQUELY AN ABSURDLY DISCRIMINATORY THAT THOSE WHO DON'T BASED THESE INJUSTICES. SOMETIMES CAN'T FATHOM THE DIRE NEED TO CORRECT THEM. SO AS I'M OFTEN REMINDED OF THE GREAT WORDS OF DR KING QUOTE. INJUSTICE ANYWHERE IS A THREAT TO JUSTICE EVERYWHERE. MEMBERS IT'S ALL OF OUR RESPONSIBILITIES TO CORRECT THE FOUR HUNDRED YEARS OF IN YOU PUT IN HUMANITY AND DISCRIMINATION AGAINST AFRICAN DESCENDANTS IN THIS STATE. EVEN IF IT SEEMS AS RIDICULOUS THE SOME THAT'S HOW I CHOOSE TO WEAR MY HAIR. THOSE OF YOU WHO KNOW I'M A MOTHER OF HEARD ME TALK ABOUT RYAN AND SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW THAT HE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEND THIS ENTIRE SUMMER IN GHANA. WORKING FOR A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION TEACHING YOUNG CHILDREN. TO READ IN A VERY REMOTE VILLAGE. AND ON Y BEHALF. HE WENT TO THE DUNGEONS I ASK HIM I COULDN'T GO SO I ASKED HIM TO GO TO. HERE WITH ME DIRECTLY WHAT THE EXPERIENCE WAS TO GO TO THE DUNGEONS. THE GOAL AND LOOK OUT THE DOOR OF NO RETURN. AND TO IMAGINE IF HE COULD AS AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD. TO STEP OUTSIDE OF THE DOOR LOOKING OUT AT A BASS OCEAN AND HAVE VIRTUALLY NO IDEA. WHAT WAS TO BECOME OF YOU YOUR FAMILY YOUR CHILDREN YOUR LIFE THEY HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO CONCEPT. OF WHAT THAT MIDDLE PASSAGE EXPERIENCE WOULD BE LIKE. ANSEL WAS AMAZING TO ME THROUGH THE EYES AND THE STORY OF AN EIGHTEEN YEAR ALL WHAT HE FELT. IN STANDING AS A YOUNG AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN BORN AND RAISED IN CALIFORNIA WHAT IT FELT LIKE TO STAND IN THE DUNGEON AND IMAGINE WHAT HIS FOR MOTHERS IN FOR FATHERS MUST OF FELT LIKE. YOUNG MEN AS YOUNG AS HE IS THAT A TEAM SO TODAY I WEAR MY BRACELET THAT HE BROUGHT ME BACK MADE BY THE CHILDREN IN THE VILLAGE YOU WORKED IN AND KOASATI. AS A REMINDER TO MYSELF. AS IF I NEED ONE. ALL I NEED TO DO IS LOOK IN THE MIRROR EVERY DAY. OF Y. SIXTY NINETEEN IN THAT HISTORY IS SO IMPORTANT AND SHOULD BE IMPORTANT TO US ALL I STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF A C. R. ONE THIRTY AND HOPE THAT YOU WILL OF. AS WELL. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL. FOR THE DISCUSSION DEBATE CENTER DRAWS SO. THANK YOU AND THE ARE ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT. AS VICE CHAIR OF THE LATINO CAUCUS I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT. WE ALSO LOOK AT ANOTHER PART OF THE HISTORY OF AFRICAN AMERICANS IN THIS NATION AND THAT IS THE PART THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE COURAGE AND THE RESISTANCE. THAT THEY HAVE LED WHICH HAVE OPEN THE WAY FOR OTHERS OF US. TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE RIGHTS THAT WE DESERVE AND THAT WE HAVE IN THIS IN THIS COUNTRY AND PARTICULARLY. IMMIGRANTS THE ONLY GROUP OF IMMIGRANTS TO THIS NATION THAT WERE FORCED TO COME HERE. WITH SLAVERY WAS THE AFRICANS. AND AFRICAN AMERICANS. EVERYONE ELSE CAME HERE. BECAUSE WE WANTED A BETTER LIFE WE THOUGHT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A BETTER LIFE. AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE RECOGNIZE THE FORCE. THAT THAT. BLACK MEN AND WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE FORCED TO COME TO THIS COUNTRY. THAT IS A VERY DISTINCT HISTORY IN THIS COUNTRY BUT MORE THAN ANYTHING I WANT TO STAND. AND SHOW LOVE RESPECT AND HONOR FOR THE MANY MANY. MILLIONS OF AFRICAN AMERICANS. WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES. WERE NOT ONLY A BETTER LIFE FOR THEMSELVES BUT FOR THE REST OF US THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR DRAWS SENATOR GLAZER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS. YOU KNOW A RESOLUTION LIKE THIS. CAN MAKE PEOPLE FEEL VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. IT'S ONE THING TO LOOK BACK IN HISTORY. AND SEE THINGS THAT WERE DONE TERRIBLY RONG AND SIMPLY ACKNOWLEDGE IT AND THEN TURN THE PAGE. BUT IT'S ANOTHER THING TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE WRONG AND SAY WE HAVE TO MAKE IT RIGHT. AND YET. HOW DID HOW DOES ONE DO THAT HOW DOES ONE DO THAT. WHEN THE ERRORS WERE DONE SO LONG AGO AND- IN SUCH A CONTINUOUS WAY. AND SO YES IT'S AN UNCOMFORTABLE CIRCUMSTANCE A RESOLUTION LIKE THIS. BUT AS WE HAVE SPOKEN ON THE FLOOR ABOUT HISTORY IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES. WHERE PEOPLE THAT. WE EVEN HOLD A HIGH ESTEEM LEADERS OF OUR NATION LEADERS OF OUR STATES. IT'S A HEALTHY THING TO LOOK BACK I THINK. BUT NOT JUST TO ACKNOWLEDGE A WRONG BUT TO SAY WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE IT RIGHT. AND SO AS UNCOMFORTABLE AS IT IS TO. EVEN LOOK AT THE CIRCUMSTANCE LOOK AT THIS HISTORY I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. AND I. URGE THE PASSAGE OF THE RESOLUTION TODAY. THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER MEMBERS ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE CENTER SKINNER. Q. MADAM PRESIDENT DIAMOND MEMBERS SOME PRE SHOULD HAVE OF THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION WHICH I ALSO STAND STRONG SUPPORTER OF. WE'VE RECOGNIZED WHAT THE- INTERMENT OF OUR JAPANESE AMERICANS. DID IN TERMS OF THE ECONOMIC IMPACT ON THE AND THEIR FAMILIES AND WHILE THE REPARATIONS THAT WERE GIVEN TO JAPANESE AMERICANS. DID NOT REALLY MEET THE REAL FULL ECONOMIC IMPACT IT LEAST ACKNOWLEDGED THE HARM IN AN ECONOMIC WAY THAT OUR POLICY. DID TO THAT TO A FULL GENERATION AND MULTIPLE GENERATIONS OF JAPANESE AMERICANS SO WE'VE APOLOGIZED TO JAPANESE AMERICANS WE HAVE GIVEN ORDER THROUGH A MULTIPLE OTHER RECOGNITIONS HAND WE HAVE GIVEN REPARATIONS. BUT FOR DESCENDANTS OF SLAVES IN THIS COUNTRY WE HAVE NOT DONE THAT AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER WE HAVE A BLACK HISTORY MONTH OR ANY OTHER WAYS THAT WE SOMEHOW TONE FOR THE SIN OF SLAVERY ON THE FOUNDING OF THIS COUNTRY AND THE ECONOMIC WEALTH OF THIS COUNTRY THE ONLY REAL WAY. TO APPROPRIATELY. CORRECT THAT'S AN OF SLAVERY IS TO PROVIDE REPARATIONS TO THIS DESCENDANTS OF BLACK SLAVES NOW WHILE THIS RESOLUTION DOES NOT HAVE. THE COSTS RELATED TO THOSE REPARATIONS IT IT LEAST ADDS. TO A COMMITMENT TO HAVING THAT DISCUSSION. IT TO GETTING THERE WHICH IS IN MY OPINION ESSENTIAL AND WITHTHAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER SENATOR MONNING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I STAND IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION JUST A LITTLE HISTORY LESSON ON THIS FLOOR IF YOU LOOK OVER AT THE BUS. THAT LEROY IS STANDING IN FRONT OF RIGHT THERE OF. FORMER STATE SENATOR. DAVID BRODERICK HE WAS KILLED IN A DUEL. WITH A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE NAMED DAVID TERRY. BRODERICK STOOD FOR CALIFORNIA NOT BEING A SLAVE STATE. N. SUPREME COURT JUSTICE DAVID TERRY. WANT TO CALIFORNIA TO BE A SLAVE STATE THE WAY THEY SETTLED THAT DISPUTE WAS A DUAL AT LAKE MERCED. WHERE. SENATOR BRODERICK LOST HIS LIFE. FAST FORWARD TO OUR EXPERIENCE. WHAT COMES TO MIND IS THE PROCESS THAT WAS UNDERTAKEN IN SOUTH AFRICA. AT THE END OF APARTHEID WHEN NELSON MANDELA LED A TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION PROCESS TO BRING TOGETHER VICTIMS OF APARTHEID WITH THE OPPRESSORS TO ADDRESS FACE TO FACE HOW THEY WERE GOING TO BUILD A NEW SOUTH AFRICA. I'D SUBMIT THAT PROCESS WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL THAT PROCESS IS NEVER TAKEN PLACE IN THE UNITED STATES AND WE BEGAN BUYING NICK KNOWLEDGE MINT OF THE NEED FOR RECOGNITION AND REPARATIONS THAT HOPEFULLY WILL PROMOTE IN INFORM DIALOGUE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR SCHOOLS. TO BUILD A FUTURE THAT CANNOT HIDE THE PAST HIGHER CHEN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR MINING THIRD AWAY SO. I JUST WANT TO ADD ON JUST TO SIMPLY SAY THAT THIS THIS COUNTRY IS STILL A STRUGGLING WITH THIS ISSUE. WE'RE STILL STRUGGLING WITH WITH THE PAST IT'S STILL VERY MUCH ALIVE WE SEE SO MANY ECONOMIC. INJUSTICES AND IMBALANCES AND INEQUALITIES IN OUR COUNTRY THAT FOR SO MANY TO HAVE TO STILL LIVE IN POVERTY. WHEN IT WHEN SOME GAINS WERE STARTED TO BE MADE IN THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES UNFORTUNATELY HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE PASSED BILLS LIKE PROP ONE EIGHTY SEVEN AND PROP TOOL FOR. THAT HAVE. OF GREATLY DIMINISHED OUR ABILITY TO EDUCATE. PEOPLE IN THE IN THE DISEASE DISADVANTAGED A COLUMN. WE STILL HAVEN'T NATIVE AMERICANS THAT ARE HAVE THE HIGHEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATES IN THE LOWEST COLLEGE GRADUATION RATES HIGHEST. OF THE HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUT RATES NATIVE A AND YOU KNOW THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY ALSO. LIZ IN IN SUCH DIRE STRAITS IN THIS COUNTRY YET. WE HAVE LAWS THAT HAVE. GOTTEN IN IN THE WAY OF US HELP HELPING TO RESTORE SOME LEVEL OF JUSTICE TO THESE MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY. SO I SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION BUT I THINK WE NEED TO REVISIT. THE WAY CALIFORNIA APPLIES EQUITABLE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PEOPLE THE STATE WE NEED TO OVERTURN PROP TWO OH FOUR. WE NEED TO FIND WAYS TO IMPROVE THE EDUCATION OF OUR SCHOOLS AS YOU KNOW MANY OF OUR SCHOOLS. FUNDING IS RELATED TO THIS IS TIED TO. THEIR THEIR LOCAL TAX BASE AND OFTEN TIMES THAT'S A VERY. UNFAIR WAY OF ALLOCATING THAT. SO TWO OH NINE I'M SORRY PROP TWO OH NINE THANK YOU. THE SENATOR MISDIRECTED ME PROP TWO OH NINE IS THE PROPOSITION I WAS MENTIONING. BUT THAT IS STILL VERY MUCH THE LONG CALIFORNIA SOME WE NEED TO CHANGE AND CALLIN FOR UNITY TO TAKE A LEAD ON THIS AND I APPLAUD THIS MEASURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR HUESO CENTER PAN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT CENTERS I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF US POURTANT RESOLUTION AND- NO THIS THE RESOLUTION SPEAKS TO THE HISTORY WHICH DISPLAYS THE FIRST BROUGHT TO VIRGINIA ACTUALLY I SPENT PART OF MY USE GOING UP IN VIRGINIA AND COURSE THE RIVER VISITING JAMESTOWN AND IN WILLIAMSBURG AND SO FORTH BUT PEOPLE THAN OFTEN TALK MUCH ABOUT THE HISTORY OF SLAVERY AND AT LEAST AT THAT TIME WHEN I WAS GOING UP WHEN YOU IS THERE CERTAINLY KNEW. BUT I THINK THE- ISSUE OF CERTAINLY REPARATIONS WE THINK ABOUT THE TREMENDOUS. ASSET DISCREPANT TALK ABOUT INTO DESPAIR YOUR INCOME DISPARITY BY GENDER INCOME THE STREET I RACED WE TALK ABOUT THE ASSETS. DISPARITIES THAT WE HAVE THAT'S A CUMULATIVE THE FACT OF NOT ONLY SLAVERY BUT OF COURSE OF JIM CROW IN OTHER A SEGREGATION WHERE. AFTER AMERICANS WERE NOT ALLOWED O SENSUALLY TO KEENLY WEALTH. AND WE NEED TO ADDRESS THAT THAT IS FAR THE FUNDAMENTAL INJUSTICE OF WHAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND SO I THINK THIS RESOLUTION CERTAINLY IS A STEP FORWARD. A CERTAINLY IS SOMEONE WHOSE OUT. OF THE API BACKGROUND I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE SAY WELL I CAME OVER LATER NOW THIS IS PART OF OUR COUNTRY'S PART OF FABRIC OF OUR COUNTRY IS PART OF IT. THE NATURE OF OUR COUNTRY GREW AND WE NEED TO FACE THAT AND THIS RESOLUTION SO IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD IN THAT AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON THIS RESOLUTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN CENTER ARCHULETA. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION. BUT I COME THROUGH IT IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT BECAUSE THE FACT THAT. I SERVED. WITH THE EIGHTY SECOND AIRBORNE AND WE'RE STATION ORIGINALLY IN FORT BRAGG NORTH CAROLINA. SO YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW THIS GUY FROM CALIFORNIA WAS IN NORTH CAROLINA BECAUSE THE AFRICAN AMERICAN FRIENDS WHO I HAD AT THE TIME. WE'RE LIKE ME. THEY WERE FROM LOS ANGELES WE WERE ALL TOGETHER WERE MELTING POT. SO I HAD NO IDEA THAT THE SOUTH WAS GOING THROUGH THAT IN THE SIXTIES. BUT I DID LEARN. THAT THE MAN THAT I SHARED WITH THAT IT THAT UNIT THE EIGHTY SECOND AIRBORNE WITH THE BRAVES. AUDIBLE AND THE MOST AMERICAN THEY COULD POSSIBLY BE THEY LOVE THIS COUNTRY THEY FOUGHT FOR IT THEY BELIEVED IN IT. AND I WAS PROUD TO SERVE THEM SURE WITH THEM SIDE BY SIDE SO I AM PROUD TO CALL THEM BROTHERS AND SISTERS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY COLUMN TO AMERICANS AS THEY SHOULD BE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. THANK YOU CENTER ARCHULETA MEMBERS IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SEEING AND HEARING NONE CENTER BRADFORD WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FROM ALL ACROSS THE STATE WHO RECOGNIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS MEASURE. AS WE TALK ABOUT THE ATROCITIES THAT HAVE BEEN COMMITTED. ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY AND ALL OVER THE WORLD THERE'S NO GREATER ONE THEN THEN SLAVE MEANT OF AFRICANS WHO WERE BROUGHT HERE AGAINST YOUR WILL OVER FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO AND TO RECOGNIZE THIS TO THIS RESOLUTION IS JUST A SMALL STEP. BUT WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO WHEN PRESIDENT LINCOLN SIGN DECAL EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION IT STATED THAT AFRICAN SLAVES AND THEIR DESCENDANTS WOULD BE ENTITLED TO FORTY ACRES AND A MULE. ANOTHER BROKEN PROMISE BY THIS COUNTRY TO THE PEOPLE OF AFRICAN DESCENT WE'RE STILL STRIVING FOR OUR EQUAL SHARE OF WHAT IS THE AMERICAN DREAM WHAT IS THE CALIFORNIA DREAM. IT IS ONLY FAIR WE HAVE FOUGHT FOR REPARATIONS AS WE STATED FOR JAPANESE AMERICANS TO WERE WRONGFULLY INTERNED DURING A WORLD WAR TWO WE'VE EVEN FOUGHT FOR WAR BENEFITS FOR FILIPINO BROTHERS AND SISTERS WHO FOUGHT. IN WORLD WAR TWO. WHAT MAKES THIS COUNTRY GREAT WHAT MAKES THIS GREAT. IS THE ENSLAVEMENT OF BOX WHO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS COUNTRY AND WE HAVE FAILED TO RECOGNIZE IT THIS RESOLUTION IS A SMALL STEP IN RECOGNIZING THE MASSIVE CONT CONTRIBUTIONS THAT. AFRICAN AMERICANS AND AFRICAN DESCENDANTS OF MAY TO THIS COUNTRY REPARATIONS IS JUST A SMALL PART OF A DEVELOPMENT THAT SHOULD SAVE WE'RE SORRY FOR THE INJUSTICE THAT BAT A PEOPLE HAVE SUFFERED IN ORDER TO MAKE CALIFORNIA GREAT IN ORDER TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.

AND SB SEVEN ONE FOUR IS A SAD. I AM DOWN IT SHOULD HAVE GONE TO COMMITTEE. BUT IT APPEARS WE'RE JUST TALKING PAST EACH OTHER. YES VACCINES HAVE AN AMAZING MODERN HAVE BEEN AN AMAZING MODERN DAY TOOL TO READ TO CREATE SMALL POX POLIO AND MUCH MORE. BUT NO. CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS ARE ALLERGIC TO THE INGREDIENTS OF ONE OR MORE OF THE VACCINE. THEREFORE IMMUNIZE THOSE WHO CAN AND CHAU GRACE AND MERCY TO THOSE WHO CAN'T. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CHILDREN. SACRAMENTO SEEMS TO BE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT BOB CATS. IN THE ARE ABOUT TODDLERS WHO DO NOT RECOVER FROM AN ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK. WISDOM WOULD DICTATE THAT WE FIND THE SWEET SPOT. OR PUT THIS DEBATE ON HOLD UNTIL WE FIND IT. CALLING SINCE BILL'S GONE PAST PROPER FORM AND DECORUM IT NOW STRIKES ME AS VINDICTIVE. THIS LEGISLATION IS EVEN SCARING OUR MEDICAL COMMUNITY. MY MOTHER HAD FIVE. BROTHERS. ALL GREW UP ON THE FARM ALL BIG STRAPPING GUYS MY UNCLE HURLED REMINDED ME OF CHARLTON HESTON WHEN I SAW HIM WORKING ONE DAY SHIRT OFF MOVING. PAY BILLS ON THE JERRY. I WOULD NEVER MESS WITH UNCLE HURLED HE AND HIS MY AUNT GLADYS HAD FOUR WONDERFUL SONS AND THEN WHEN NUMBER FIVE NUMBER FIVE SON CAME. ROBBIE WAS DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED. HE A NEVER LEARN TO TALK. HE NEVER WALK OR CRAWLED. MY AUNT AND UNCLE HAD TO. A SYSTEM EVERY DAY. HIS MUSCLES KEEP HIM MOVING. WHEN WE VISITED WE WOULD DO THE SAME WITH ROBBIE. HAVING A DISABLED CHILD IS A FULL TIME OBLIGATION. IT CHANGES YOUR LIFE DRAMATICALLY AND THAT'S WHAT THESE PEOPLE FEAR. ROBBIE PASSED AWAY IN YOUR DISTRICT MADAM CHAIR PROBABLY GREW UP IN CHINO. ROBBIE PASSED AT ABOUT THE AGE OF TEN. AND I'VE NEVER SEEN MY UNCLE. SO BROKEN. IS THAT THE FUNERAL. WE'VE GOT TO CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES OF ALLERGIC REACTIONS. WE'VE GOT TO HIT THE PAUSE BUTTON MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES AND I URGE A NO VOTE ON SB SEVEN ONE FOUR THANK YOU MEDI REDDITOR MORLOCK SENATOR STONE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND COLLEAGUES AND. BEFORE I START I WOULD LIKE TO. RESPECTFULLY ASK PEOPLE IN THE GALLERY IN PEOPLE IN THE CAPITAL TO. WATCH YOUR DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. WITH RESPECT. THIS IS THE LEGISLATIVE BODY IN THE SENATE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND. YOU KNOW THIS. ISSUE OVER IMMUNIZATIONS HAS. PRESS NEED TO. MAJOR. PRESSURES OF MY OWN PROFESSION OF BEING A PHARMACIST AND HAS PUSHED ME TO THE LIMITS. BENG AN ELECTED OFFICIAL AND BALANCING THE TWO. YOU KNOW. I THINK IT'S UNFORTUNATE IF ANY OF US. EVER VILIFY PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO HAVE A VOICE HERE IN THE STATE CAPITAL. AND I'VE HEARD OVER. THE YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN HERE WHEN. PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE PARENTAL RIGHTS OVER THEIR CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND ARE. LABELED EXTREMISTS LABELED ANTI BAXTER'S. WHEN THERE IS NOTHING STRONGER MY FRIENDS. THEN WANTING THE BEST FOR YOU THE HEALTH AND WELFARE OF YOUR CHILD. NOW. I KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT MEDICINE TO BE DANGEROUS. HI THERE ARE THOSE OF YOU THAT OF ALLEGED ON THE FLOOR THAT I SHOULD BE BE TALKING ABOUT LEGAL ISSUES BECAUSE I'M NOT A LAWYER AND THEREFORE. MY COMMENTS ARE MY OPINIONS SO SHOULD BE DISREGARDED. THE I. WELCOME PEOPLE TO DEBATE ME AND- DISCUSS THE MERITS OF. MEDICINE AND DRUGS. LET ME JUST SAY A FEW THINGS. WHEN WE WERE CONSIDERING SB TWO SEVENTY SEVEN. IT WAS AT THE TIME I HAD MY FIRST GRAND CHILD. AND IT WAS DETERMINED. THAT. MY GRANDDAUGHTERS ONE YEAR BIRTHDAY. THAT SHE WAS AUTISTIC WE DIDN'T KNOW. TO WHAT EXTENT. IT HAPPENED. AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME THAT SHE RECEIVE THE MMR VACCINE. COINCIDENTALLY THE SYMPTOMS OF AUTISM CHAU AT APPROXIMATELY THE SAME TIME. AND I HAD A. A CHALLENGE WITH MY OWN CHILDREN. WHEN SB TWO SEVENTY SEVEN CAME ON AND I WAS A CO AUTHOR OF TWO SEVENTY SEVEN BECAUSE I'M NOT ONLY LEARNED ABOUT IMMUNIZATIONS I'VE TAUGHT ABOUT THEM AT THE UNIVERSITY LEVEL. BUT IT CREATED SOME SIGNIFICANT FRICTION. BETWEEN MY CHILDREN. AND MYSELF. AND LET ME SAY THIS THEY DON'T THEY CALL. MEDIC GIVING MEDICAL SERVICES A PRACTICE AND THE REASON WHY THEY CALL IT AT A PRACTICE IS BECAUSE IT'S NOT PERFECT. WE DO THE BEST THAT WE CAN. TO HEAL PEOPLE AND PREVENT THEM OF DISEASES THAT ARE MINOR AND DISEASES THAT ARE VERY SERIOUS. BUT HERE'S WHAT WE DO NOW. WE KNOW THAT A HUMAN IMMUNE SYSTEM. IS NOT FULLY MATURE UNTIL A CHILD IS TWELVE TO FOURTEEN YEARS OLD AND WHILE I BELIEVE IN THIS IS ONLY ME SPEAKING WITH NO SCIENTIFIC BACK UP. AS I LOOK AND SEE THE INCIDENCE OF. AUTISM IN THE STATE IN THE COUNTRY. IS THAT. WITH THE IMMUNIZATION SCHEDULES THAT WE SEE. I THINK THAT THE SCHEDULE THAT WE GIVE THESE IMMUNIZATIONS AND MAY BE TOO ONEROUS SERVE YOU WELL MAYBE TOO OVERWHELMING FOR A CHILD'S IMMUNE SYSTEM. THE BECAUSE WHAT'S CALLED AN AUTO IMMUNE REACTION NOW WHAT IS AN AUTO IMMUNE DISEASE MANY OF YOU HAVE HEARD OF THINGS LIKE LUPUS AND ALL SORT OF COLITIS AND GRAVES DISEASE FIBROMYALGIA. VASCULITIS RHEUMATOID FEVER. WE'RE STILL LEARNING ABOUT THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND HOW IT WORKS AND A LOT OF THESE TV COMMERCIALS THAT YOU SEE ABOUT DRUGS THAT TREAT THINGS LIKE ALL SORT OF CORRUPT COLITIS AND RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS OR DRUGS TO TRY TO TEMPER OUR OWN IMMUNE SYSTEM FROM ATTACKING. NORMAL CELLS AND TISSUES. WITHIN THE HUMAN BODY. SO. WE HAVE. THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND THEY MONITOR. DRUGS ALONG WITH THE FEDERAL DRUG ADMINISTRATION AND THEY. THEY PRINT ADVERSE REACTIONS THAT HAPPEN WHEN SOME POPULATIONS ARE IMMUNIZED. BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT NOT EVERY ADVERSE REACTION IS PRINTED IN THE CDC GUIDELINES. AND THAT'S WHERE I THINK THAT THE PATIENT AND PHYSICIAN RELATIONSHIP. BECOMES SOMETHING THAT IS IMPORTANT. AND SOMETHING THAT CERTAINLY. SHOULD BE RESPECTED. SO. HERE WE ARE TODAY. AND WE ALWAYS WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR CITIZENS HAVE THE RIGHT TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES IT'S DEMOCRACY. BUT AS WE HAVE SEEN SB SEVEN ONE FOUR COME TO THE FOREFRONT. I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A MOCKERY OF DEMOCRACY. IF WE ALLOW THIS BILL. TO NOT HAVE THE ONE PUBLIC HEARING. CONTENT OF SB SEVEN ONE FOUR IS A MATERIAL CHANGE TO THE LEGISLATION THAT WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY. AN ACTOR. MEMBERS LET'S GO ALL THE WAY BACK. ALL THE WAY BACK TO TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WHEN SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN WAS DEBATED IN THIS LEGISLATURE. I KNOW BECAUSE I WAS A PROPONENT. ONE OF THE REASONS I SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE WAS BECAUSE MY- GOOD CALLING FROM SACRAMENTO. PROMISE THAT WITH ITS PASSAGE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS WOULD BE ALLOWED IN HONOR. BUT DON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT. TAKE THE SENATORS WORDS ON APRIL FIFTEENTH TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. MY FRIEND THE SENATOR FROM SAN FRANISCO RELEASED A FACT VERSUS MATH PRESS RELEASE IN WHICH HE SAYS THAT IT IS FALSE. I QUOTE SB TWO SEVENTY SEVEN WOULD PREVENT CHILDREN WHO NEED THEM FROM RECEIVING EXEMPTIONS. HE THEN FOLLOWED UP BY SAYING SB TWO SEVENTY SEVEN LEAVES TO THE DISCRETION OF DOCTORS. WHEN A CHILD REQUIRES A MEDICAL EXEMPTION FROM REQUIRED VACCINE VACCINATIONS. CALIFORNIANS WERE TOLD AT THE TIME AND TIME AGAIN. THE EXEMPTIONS WOULD BE ALLOW. THE SENATOR AND THE LEGISLATURE. INCLUDED MYSELF INCLUDING MYSELF MADE A PROMISE. BUT COLLEAGUES THAT PROMISES NOT BEING CUFFED. EVEN OUR ILLUSTRIOUS GOVERNOR SAW THE FLAWS IN SB TWO SEVENTY SIX AND- INSISTED ON AMENDMENTS. OR. HE WOULD BASICALLY THREATENED TO NOT SIGN OR POTENTIALLY VETO THE LEGISLATIO AND THAT BRINGS US TO HEAR TODAY RIGHT NOW VOTING ON THIS BILL. THAT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF PASSING LEGISLATION IN THE DARK OF NIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY. WHY DO I SAY THAT. WELL TO BEGIN SB SEVEN ONE FOUR WAS NOT. AND NEVER WILL BE HEARD IN PUBLIC. BECAUSE OF THE WAVING OF RULE TWENTY NINE DASH CAM AND WHAT DOES THE RULE TWENTY NINE DASH TEN SAY. IT PROTECTED THIS INSTITUTION AND TO PROTECT THE CITIZENS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT IT THE BILL WAS TO BE GOT AN AMENDED. WHICH I BELIEVE IS AN ABUSE OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AT LEAST IT WOULD BE A PUBLIC HEARING SO THE PUBLIC COULD WEIGH IN. ON A BILL THAT THEY SUPPORT. FOR A BILL THAT THEY OPPOSE. HOWEVER. AS THE SAYING GOES RULES ARE MEANT TO BE BROKEN AND THIS LEGISLATURE HAS SURE TAKEN. THAT SAYING TO HEART. JOINT REAL TWENTY NINE DASH TEN WAS WAY. IN OUR CONSTITUENTS WERE NEVER GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY. TO FORMALLY FORCED TO VOICE THEIR OPINIONS ON SB SEVEN ONE FOUR WHAT DO YOU FRAZIER. WE ALREADY KNOW WHAT THE OUTCOME OF THE VOTE IS GOING TO BE WITH US LEGISLATURE WHY NOT GIVE THE CONSTITUENTS MANY OF WHOM. ROLL ALL NIGHT LONG. TO COME TO THIS CAPITAL SO THEIR VOICE COULD BE HEARD SO THAT THEIR LEGISLATURE. AND THEIR CAPITAL BUT TELL THEM WE DON'T WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU. WE DON'T CARE WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY. WE'RE COMING ON THE FLOOR WE'RE GOING TO VOTE THE WAY WE ARE TOLD THE WAY WE FEEL WE'RE GOING TO VOTE ON THIS ISSUE WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH US. OR DISAGREE WITH US. AND TO SEE MY FRIENDS IN THE CAPITAL OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE'RE TO THE LEFT IS ALWAYS TALK ABOUT TOLERANCE AND ACCEPTANCE. AND DIFFERING OPINIONS I HAVE TO SEE THIS MORNING BUT NOT ONLY A MOTHER BUT A GRANDMOTHER IT'S TOUGH TO IN THE FRONT OF THE CAPITOL IT IS ARRESTED BECAUSE THEY WANT EXHIBIT THEIR SECOND THE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS. JUST A FEW HOURS AGO. SB SEVEN ONE FOUR MOVED TO THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR AND- HERE IT IS ON THE SENATE FLOOR. THIS BILL IS BE VOTED ON WITHOUT EVER BEING HEARD TO THE PUBLIC HEARING PROCESS STIFLING ANY CITIZEN FROM COMMENTING FOR AGAINST THE MEASURE. COLLEAGUES PUBLIC HEARINGS MATTER. THEY MAY NOT SEEM TO BY SOME MEMBERS HERE BUT THEY MATTER TO THE PEOPLE THEY MATTER TO THE OPEN PROCESS THOSE LEGISLATURE PRETENDS TO SUPPORT. THE MATTER TO THE INTEGRITY THIS LEGISLATURE SEEMS TO BE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO CALL INTO QUESTION. THE PUBLIC DESERVES A CHANCE TO VOICE THEIR OPINION ON ALL MEASURES THE PASS THROUGH THIS HOUSE. SOME OF THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT NOT THINK LISTENING TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS IS NECESSARY. SOME MAY NOT EVEN WANT TO HEAR WHAT THEIR PEOPLE THINK BUT- JUST BECAUSE YOU DISAGREE WITH THE PUBLIC DOESN'T MEAN THAT OUR VOICES SHOULD BE SILENCE. AND IGNORED NOT ONLY IS IT BAD BUSINESS IT'S ON DEMOCRATIC AND EVEN WORSE I WOULD SAY IT'S A MOCKERY OF DEMOCRACY. YOU KNOW MY FRIENDS. I SAT THROUGH A VERY LONG HEARING IN THE HEALTH COMMITTEE WILL BE HEARD SB TWO SEVENTY SIX AND I WAS THE CHAIRMAN. AND I CHOSE TO. GIVE THE AUTHOR A LOT OF RESPECT IN. IN RESERVING MY OPINIONS FOR THE FLOOR AND GIVING HIM AN HONEST AND EARNEST CHANCE TO PASS HIS BILL. BUT I HAVE TO BE VERY HONEST WITH YOU. THERE WAS A COUPLE THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT CAME WITH IT DIDN'T COME ALONE. THEY CAME WITH THEIR VACCINE INJURED CHILDREN. AND WHEN I SAW THE MORBIDITY OF WHAT VACCINATIONS CAM DUE TO PEOPLE. YOU HAVE TO WONDER. THESE PEOPLE HAVE VERY GOOD POINTS TO BE CONCERNED IF THEIR CHILDREN AFTER CHILD HAD AN ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION HAD PERMANENT BRAIN DAMAGE TO IMMUNIZATION. WOULD YOU WANT YOUR GRANDCHILDREN TO BE IMMUNIZED IF IT'S A FAMILY HISTORY OF AN ADVERSE REACTION THAT YOU DON'T KNOW COULD HAPPEN TO A SECONDCHILD IN THAT SAME FAMILY. I BECAME VERY EMPATHETIC WHEN I SAW NOT ONE NOT TWO WE'RE TALKING. DOZENS IF NOT OVER A HUNDRED OF SEVERELY INJURED KIDS NOW. I BELIEVE THAT THESE INJURIES. ARE RARE BUT THEY HAPPEN IN EVERY PARENT HAS THE RIGHT TO BE CONCERNED. ABOUT THE HEALTH AND WELFARE OF THEIR CHILDREN. LET'S JUST QUICKLY GET BACK TO EXEMPTIONS LET'S ASSUME THAT THE STATUS QUO WERE TO CONTINUE. YES YOU WOULD STILL SEE POCKETS OF IMMUNIZATION LESS THAN 95% IF YOU ALLOW THE EXEMPTION PROCESS TO CONTINUE AS IT HAS MY FRIENDS LESS THAN 1% OF THE CHILDREN THAT ARE IMMUNIZED IN THE STATE WOULD BE GIVEN EXEMPTIONS THAT'S NOT NEAR ENOUGH TO TAKE US BELOW A 95% HEARD. IMMUNIZATION SO WHY ARE WE PICKING A FIGHT. THOUSANDS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF. PARENTS WANTING TO PROTECT THEIR CHILDREN IN A SYSTEM THAT WORKS IN A SYSTEM THAT WAS PROMISED TO BE IMPLEMENTED A CERTAIN WAY ONLY TO HAVE THE CARPET PULLED OUT FROM UNDERNEATH THEM. I CAN'T TELL YOU. HOW IT HURTS ME. WHEN I VISIT MY SON AND MY DAUGHTER IN LAW. AND. I SEE MY SIX AND A HALF YEAR OLD AUTISTIC GRANDDAUGHTER. WHO WEARS A DIAPER. WHO HAS NEVER HAD A CONVERSATION WITH THEIR PARENTS OR ME. WHEN I TELL MY GRANDDAUGHTER I LOVE YOU I WOULD GIVE A MILLION DOLLARS TO HEAR MY GRANDDAUGHTER SAY I LOVE YOU GRANDPA. AND I'M HOPING THAT THROUGH TIME THAT. WITH TECHNOLOGY AND THERAPIES THAT. MY SIX AND A HALF YEAR OLD AUTISTIC GRANDDAUGHTER WILL LEAD A GOOD AND PRODUCTIVE LIFE IN SOME WAY. IT ALSO KIND OF REMINDS ME OF A COUSIN WHEN I WAS GROWING UP. MY COUSIN WAS NAMED LARRY. HILLARY WAS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. HE WAS A LITTLE BIT SLOW. AND I ASKED MY MOM AND DAD YOU KNOW WHAT'S WITH LYRICS. AND THEY SAID WELL HE WAS BORN AND HE HAD SOME BRAIN DAMAGE WHEN HE WAS BORN AND- WE'RE HOPING FOR GOOD THINGS FOR HIM. AND I HAVE TO KIND OF GIVE A SHOUT OUT BECAUSE. IT WAS PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY. THAT PUT A LOT OF THESE. PEOPLE THAT HAD BRAIN INJURIES TO WORK. MY COUSIN MARY MAY GOD REST HIS SOUL WORK FOR THE POST OFFICE IS ONE OF THE GREATEST EMPLOYEES. IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY. SO MY FRIENDS. I PLEAD WITH YOU I EMPATHIZE WITH YOU THIS SHOULDN'T BE A PARTISAN ISSUE. WE SHOULDN'T BE VILIFYING PARENTS THAT ARE ONLY ACCUSED OF WANTING THEIR CHILDREN TO BE HEALTHY WHY WOULD ANY PARENT WANT TO NOT IMMUNIZE THEIR CHILDREN AGAINST THE DISEASE LIKE MEASLES THAT COULD KILL THEIR CHILDREN AND WHAT THE OVERWHELMING FEAR THAT THEY HAVE THAT THE CURE COULD BE WORSE THAN THE DISEASE ITSELF. SO. FOR THE SAKE OF TRANSPARENCY IN IN THE SAKE OF PROCESS FOR THE SAKE OF DEMOCRACY. AND IN THE SAKE OF THIS INSTITUTION. AND TO GIVE PARENTS IN CALIFORNIA THE PEACE OF MIND THAT THEY CAN EXERT THEIR PARENTAL RIGHTS TO PROTECT THE HEALTH OF THEIR CHILDREN. I AM ASKING YOU AND I'M BEGGING YOU PLEASE VOTE NO ONE SB SEVEN ONE FOUR. THANK YOU CENTER STONE. FURTHER DISCUSSION BATES SENATOR JONES. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS. ARISE FOR A COUPLE PURPOSES THIS AFTERNOON ONE OBVIOUSLY IS TO VOTE AGAINST SB SEVEN FOURTEEN. BUT I THINK MORE IMPORTANT TO ME TODAY AFTER HAVING SERVED IN THE LEGISLATURE FOR NOW SEVEN YEARS SIX IN THE ASSEMBLY NOW ONE IN THE SENATE. I WOULD LIKE TO RISE TO APPEAL TO OUR BETTER NATURE AS THAT SENATORS ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND ALONG THAT LINE OF THOUGHT I WOULD LIKE TO DEFEND. THE HONOR OF THE SENATE. N. F. WE CAN ALL TAKE A LOOK AT THE MODEL ABOVE THE ROSTRUM. I'M GONNA TRY TO PRONOUNCE IT IN LATIN BUT ALL THE- TELL US ALL WHAT IT MEANS IN ENGLISH. SENATE TORRES S. CIVITATIS LIBERTARIAN TULARE. IT IS THE DUTY OF THE SENATE TO PROTECT THE LIBERTIES OF THE PEOPLE. THAT'S THE MOTTO THAT WE SERVE IN THIS HOUSE UNDER EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND THE SCIENCE HAS BEEN DEBATED AND THE PURPOSES OF BEEN DOING DEBATED. BUT THE QUESTION I ASK YOU TODAY. IS WHAT IMPENDING CRISIS. IS THAT IS HAPPENING TODAY IN CALIFORNIA. THAT IS COMPELLING US TO TAKE THESE EXTRAORDINARY STEPS IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. TO RAM THIS BILL THROUGH. INTRODUCE JUST UNDER THE DEADLINE OF AMENDMENTS. AND I WILL SAY. THAT I DO THANK GOD THAT FOR THE PROPOSITION A COUPLE YEARS AGO THEY GAVE US THE SEVENTY TWO HOUR RULE SO THAT TODAY IS ACTUALLY THE DEADLINE FOR TO BE INTRODUCED OTHERWISE IT COULD HAVE BEEN SLAMMED THROUGH. AT MIDNIGHT ON FRIDAY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE THIS IS AN ABUSE OF OUR POWER. THIS IS AN ABUSE OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. THIS IS A VIEWS OF THE NINE HUNDRED PLUS THOUSAND CALIFORNIA'S CITIZENS THAT EACH ONE OF US ARE ELECTED TO REPRESENT IN AN HONEST AND DUTIFUL MANNER. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE I APPEAL TO YOUR BETTER NATURE. THAT THERE IS NO IMPENDING CRISIS THAT WE HAVE TO SOLVE TODAY BY VOTING FOR THIS BILL. MADAM PRESIDENT LIKE PERMISSION TO READ ONE PARAGRAPH PLEASE WITHOUT OBJECTION. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WHEN THOMAS JEFFERSON WROTE THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE HE OUTLINED TWENTY SEVEN ABUSES. OF THE OF THE MONARCHY THAT THE COLONIES. WERE UPSET ABOUT. ANY ITEMIZE EACH ONE OF THOSE TWENTY SEVEN ABUSES IN ANY HE CLOSED THAT ITEM IS ATION WITH THIS PARAGRAPH. AT EVERY STAGE OF THESE OPPRESSIONS. WE HAVE PETITIONED PETITION FOR REDRESS IN THE MOST HUMBLE TERMS. OUR REPEATED PETITIONS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED ONLY BY REPEATED INJURY. A PRINCE WHOSE CHARACTER IS THUS MARKED BY EVERY ACT. WHICH MAY DEFINE A TYRANT IS UNFIT TO BE THE RULER OF FREE PEOPLE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE. LET'S PLEASE NOT SHOW OURSELVES TODAY TO BE ON FIT. TO BE RULERS OF FREE PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HOW WE CAN SOLVE THAT PROBLEM AND THAT PREDICAMENT IN TWO WAYS.

ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTEEN SIXTY NINE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA AN ECHO IN THE FARMS SENATE JACKSON THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES THIS MEASURE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA A. B. SIXTEEN SIXTY NINE PROMOTES GREATER PUBLIC SAFETY AND MORE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE POLICY. ENFORCEMENT MODEL FOR INDEPENDENT AMMUNITION VENDORS A CALIFORNIA GUN SHOWS CURRENT LAW OUTLINES PUBLIC SAFETY MEASURES FOR FIREARM DEALERS WHO SELL AMMUNITION IN THE STATE BUT INDEPENDENT AMMUNITION VENDORS DO NOT RECEIVE THE SAME SCRUTINY. THIS MEASURE SPONSORED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS TWO DISTINCT PARTS THE FIRST PART OF THE BILL ADDRESSES THE INCONSISTENCY WITH WHICH FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION VENDORS A CALIFORNIA GUN SHOWS ARE TREATED UNDER STATE LAW. COLLEAGUES THERE ARE OVER A HUNDRED GUN SHOWS A YEAR IN CALIFORNIA THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR ENFORCING FIREARMS LAWS ACT THESE ONE HUNDRED GUN SHOWS. THIS MEASURE THEN IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE TO CLOSE LOOPHOLES AND ENSURE ALL FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION VENDORS IN CALIFORNIA ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAME LICENSING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. SECOND PART OF THE BILL WOULD UPDATE THE DEAL RECORD OF SHALE OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE DRAWS FEE THE BILL WOULD REDUCE THE NON REGULATORY FEE FOR THE FIREARMS TRANSACTIONS FROM NINETEEN DOLLARS TO ONE DOLLAR. AND AUTHORIZED THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO CHARGE A SEPARATE FEE OF THIRTY ONE DOLLARS IN NINETEEN CENTS PER FIREARM RELATED TRANSACTION SOLELY TO COVER THE COSTS OF FIREARMS RELATED REGULATORY ACTIVITIES WITHOUT THESE ADJUSTMENTS THE DRAWS FUNDS WILL BE DEPLETED. AND THE FUND IS EXPECTED AT THIS POINT WITHOUT THIS CORRECTION AND ADJUSTMENT TO BECOME INSOLVENT INSOLVENT BY MAY OF TWENTY TWENTY. IF AND WHEN THE DRAWS FUND DOES BECOME INSOLVENT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WILL NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO COMPLETE THOSE VERY IMPORTANT BACKGROUND CHECKS WITHIN THE TEN DAY STATUTORILY REQUIRED PERIOD. THE PROPOSED THE ADJUSTMENT WOULD PROVIDE SUFFICIENT REVENUES TO AVERT THE POTENTIAL SALE OF FAR. ARMS TO PERSONS WHO HAVE NOT UNDERGONE THIS COMPLETE BACKGROUND CHECK AND THIS BILL IS ALSO A CRITICAL STEP TOWARD ENSURING THAT THE DRAWS ACCOUNT POSSESSES THE RESOURCES NECESSARY FOR OUR STATE TO MEET ITS OBLIGATION TO ADMINISTER AND ENFORCE OUR NATION'S LEADING GUN SAFETY LAWS WITH THAT.

THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TO NINETY BELIEVE IT OR NOT CURRENT LAW ALLOWS UNSCRUPULOUS HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS TO ENROLL PATIENTS IN COMMERCIAL COVERAGE. HEY INSURANCE PREMIUMS ON THEIR BEHALF THEN BILL INSURERS OUTRAGEOUS RATES THERE MANY TIMES THE COST OF PROVIDING THE ACTUAL CARE. THE LAW ALLOWS THE SCHEME TO EXPLOIT PATIENTS EVEN WHEN COMMERCIAL COVERAGE MAY NOT BE IN THE PATIENT'S BEST INTEREST IN THE END MANY PATIENTS FIND THEMSELVES FACING UNEXPECTED OUT OF POCKET COSTS. AND DISRUPTIONS IN CARE JUST SO THESE CORPORATIONS CAN MAKE IT EASY BACK OR IN THE TYPICAL CASE MANY MILLIONS OF BUCKS AND WE ALL PAY THE PRICE FOR THIS WHAT AB TWO NINETY WILL DO IS. REMOVE THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO STEER PATIENTS ON TO COMMERCIAL COVERAGE REQUIRED THAT HEALTH PLANS EXCEPT THE PREMIUM PAYMENTS AND COVER THE ENROLLEE. CREATE PATIENT BILLING PROTECTIONS SUCH AS A PROHIBITION ON BALANCE BILLING PREVENTING THE FINANCIALLY INTERESTED ENTITY FROM CUTTING OFF PAYMENTS MID YEAR AND MAKING SURE THAT THE PATIENT ISN'T STEERED INTO COVERAGE THAT DOES NOT FIT THEIR NEEDS WHAT AB TWO NINETY WILL NOT DO. IT WILL NOT APPLY TO ANY CURRENT AMERICAN KIDNEY FUND RECIPIENT AS. STOP A KF FROM PAIN PATIENTS HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE IT WILL NOT CAUSE ANY CURRENT DIALYSIS PATIENT TO LOSE COVERAGE IT WILL NOT ALLOW INSURANCE COMPANIES TO DROP AND ROLL LEASE. THE MOST A RECENT AMENDMENTS TO AB TOO MUCH NINETY MAKE THE FOLLOWING IMPORTANT CLARIFICATIONS. THESE AMENDMENTS EXCEPT EXEMPT ALL DIALYSIS PROVIDERS OTHER THAN THE TWO WORST ACTORS. GRANDFATHER ALL PATIENTS CURRENTLY RECEIVING PREMIUM ASSISTANCE FROM THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FOUNDATION. DELAY IMPLEMENTATION OF DIALYSIS RELATED PROVISIONS INTO THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FOUNDATION GETS A NEW OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL OPINION THAT SHOWS AB TWO NINETY WON'T CONFLICT WITH THEIR SAFE HARBOR. MEMBERS VOTING FOR THIS BILL WILL PROTECT PATIENTS AND BRING DOWN THE COST OF HEALTH CARE FOR CONSTITUENTS IN YOUR DISTRICT WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO AFFORD THEIR PREMIUMS. IT IS TIME THAT WE STOP THIS BLATANT MANIPULATION OF THE MARKET AND SCHEME THAT EXPLAINS PATIENTS. MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. CENTER STONE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT THIS IS A JUST A CONTINUED ASSAULT ON COMPANIES THAT ARE. CAPITALISTIC AND MAKE MONEY. HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE DIALYSIS CLINICS IN YOUR COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY IN SOME OF YOUR RURAL COMMUNITIES CALL A COMMON MAY TAKE SOME OF THE DIALYSIS CLINICS IN THE MORE URBAN AREAS IN THE MORE RURAL AREAS BECAUSE FRANKLY THERE'S NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE THE NEED DIALYSIS AND RURAL AREAS TO. JUSTIFY THE INVESTMENT OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO NOT ONLY BUILD OUT THESE FACILITIES BUT TO. STAFF FROM. AB TWO NINETY WILL HARM LOW INCOME DIALYSIS PAYS PATIENTS SUPPORTERS DISPUTE THAT BUT NOTHING IN THIS BILL TAKES PATIENCE OUT OF HARM'S WAY AS BAD THIS BILL ALSO IS A RATE SENDING BILL. WENT LIKE COMPANIES COMPETE. IF PASS A BEAT TO NINETY NEGATES PRIVATELY PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED KRON CONTRACTS. AND THAT'S PROBABLY WHY. THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF. CALIFORNIA. DIALYSIS COUNCIL IS OPPOSED ALAMEDA CONTRA COSTA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AS OPPOSED CALIFORNIA HISPANIC I'M A CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION IS. OPPOSE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IS OPPOSED A VERY IMPORTANT ORGANIZATION OF MY DISTRICT THE DESERT AIDS PROJECT. IS OPPOSED. FOR CERTAIN DIALYSIS PATIENTS IT SAID IN THE STONE THAT THE MEDICARE RATE AS THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE THE MEDICARE RATES A SO YOU'LL KNOW OFTEN DOESN'T EVEN COVER THE ENTIRE COST. OF GETTING A DIALYSIS TREATMENT TO A BENEFICIARY. THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR DIALYSIS PATIENTS IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE GROWTH RATE OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. IS 5% OF WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE CLAMPS. ON THE ABILITY OF DIALYSIS CENTERS CENTERS TO. COVER THE COSTS AND YES I KNOW IT'S A BAD WORD AROUND HERE MAKE A PROFIT. THEN YOU'RE JUST NOT GOING TO SEE THE GROWTH OF DIALYSIS ANDERSON IN THE IN THE HOUSE CITY CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY IN THE RURAL AREAS WHERE. FRANKLY I HAVE A LOT OF POVERTY. AND. WE'VE ALL SEEN WITH OUR CHILDHOOD OBESITY PROBLEM OUR GROWTH IN TYPE ONE DIABETES. A ONE OF A NUMBER ONE CAUSES OF KIDNEY FAILURE OR KIDNEY IS THAT ARE BEGINNING TO FAIL IS TYPE TWO DIABETES SO WE'RE SEEING A GROWTH IN THE NEED AND YET WE WANT TO PUT A CAP ON THE GROWTH OF DIALYSIS CENTERS BECAUSE WE'RE NOT ALLOWING THEM TO RECOUP. THEIR COSTS AND MY FRIENDS IF THEY DON'T. THERE ARE NUMBER OF AT THE NOT ALLOWED TO RECOUP THEIR COSTS WE'RE NOT GOING TO BUILD THE CENTERS AND I'M CONCERNED THAT THAT'S GOING TO REDUCE THE ACCESSIBILITY. OF NEW DIALYSIS PATIENTS THAT NEED A PLACE TO GO. WHERE THEY HAVE TO SOMETIMES GO FOUR TIMES A WEEK YEAH AND SIT FOR HOURS ON END. AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU EVER. WITNESSED A DIALYSIS PATIENT AFTER THEY'VE GONE THROUGH THE TREATMENT BUT THEY'RE EXTREMELY EXHAUSTED TAKE SOME HOURS TO RECOVER. BUT IF THEY DON'T DO-DIALYSIS THEY LOSE THEIR LIVES. SO MY FRIENDS BY SUPPORTING AB TWO NINETY PATIENTS ARE GOING TO LOSE TAXPAYERS ARE GOING TO LOSE AND CERTAINLY SO MANY PEOPLE THAT WE SAW DURING THE HEALTH COMMITTEE FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE THE CLAIM THAT WE WILL BE TAKING AWAY THIS VITAL SERVICE OF THEM. COULD BE PUT IN HARM'S WAY. LET'S MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A GOOD DIALYSIS INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE SEE A LOT OF ATTACKS ON THE HEALTH CENTER DIALYSIS CENTERS A LOT OF WHICH IS COME FROM LABOR. AGAIN YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO HAVE WHAT'S CALLED A LABOR CAUCUS HERE IN THIS IN THE STATE SENATE A LABOR CAUCUS AND SO WE HAVE THESE BILLS THAT ARE SHUT DOWN OUR THROATS BY LABOR RELEASE WE CAN. POINT TO AN ORGANIZATION THAT IS TELLING US WHAT WE SHOULD DO AND WE SEE THIS TIME AND TIME AGAIN HERE IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR. SO WHO YOU GONNA SUPPORT EVEN SUPPORT THE LABOR UNIONSON THIS ONE ARE YOU GONNA SUPPORT FOR PATIENTS IN THE DIALYSIS ESPECIALLY POOR PATIENTS YOUR VOTE IN AB TWO NINETY WAS CERTAIN INDICATE THAT I KNOW I'M VOTING I VOTING NO ONE AB TWO NINETY. BETTER NIELSEN. THAT A PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE SENATE I AS WELL URGENT NO VOTE. THERE HAVE BEEN PROBLEMATIC LAST MINUTE AMENDMENTS SOMETIMES WE CAN GET AROUND THOSE SOMETIMES WE CAN'T. BUT THE OPPOSITION IS INSTRUCTIVE PARTICULARLY TO ONE WHO REPRESENTS A RURAL AREA AND HAS DEALT EXTENSIVELY WITH. THE PAUCITY OF CLINICS AVAILABLE TO THE FOLKS THAT WE SERVE IN OUR RURAL AREAS. AND I GATHER THAT'S IN PART WHY THE KIDNEY FUND. AS CONCERNED ABOUT THIS. THEY NOTE THAT THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS WILL NOT NOW BE ABLE TO BE SERVED. 68% OF THESE PATIENTS THAT THEY A SISTER AFRICAN AMERICAN LATINO OR ASIAN. WITH AN AVERAGE INCOME OF ONLY THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. THAT SOUNDS A LOT LIKE POPULATIONS THAT THOSE OF US WHO REPRESENT RURAL AREAS HAVE GOT TO CONTEND WITH. WHAT ARE NOT WHAT IS NOT ANSWERED THEN IS WHAT WILL THEN HAPPEN. TO THEIR HEALTHCARE. IF THERE IS NOT AN SENATE. AND COMPANIES THAT DO PROVIDE THEY HAVE TO HAVE SOME INCENTIVE AS MY- COLLEAGUE HAS JUST MENTIONED. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IT'S C. CONSTRAINING OF THE OPPORTUNITY OF OUR DIALYSIS PATIENTS. TO HAVE THAT ACCESS. AND I AM VERY KEENLY HALL TO KEENLY AWARE. FOR MORE OF PLOY A THAT I SPENT SO MUCH TIME WITH OVER THE LAST MANY YEARS. WHO DID HAVE TO SUFFER THE RIGORS. THE RIGORS OF THAT TREATMENT. EVERY WEEK SIMPLY TO STAY ALIVE. AND THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY IT TOOK HIM TO RECOVER. FROM THE RIGORS OF THAT DIALYSIS. WHEN YOU'RE TRIFLING OR AFFECTING THE HEALTH OF INDIVIDUALS 2 DEGREES IN THAT THIS WILL. IT IS INCUMBENT ON US TO BE VERY VERY CAREFUL. ABOUT KNOWING. THE LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES AS WELL AS THE SHORT TERM CONSEQUENCES I URGE A NO VOTE. SENATOR MITCHELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES I'M A MEMBER OF HEALTH COMMITTEE AND WE HAD A LONG FASTENING DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS BILL AND LET ME BE CLEAR ABOUT THE BILL THAT'S BEFORE US TODAY IT. IS A COMPROMISE. I WOULD LOTS OF ENGAGEMENT FROM LEADERSHIP WITH THE COMMON GOAL OF PROTECTING PATIENTS. I THINK THE MILLIONS THAT EITHER THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FINE OR WHOEVER SPENT ON BUYING COMMERCIAL TIME ON FOR THOSE COMMERCIALS WITH OFF IN THE LAST MONTH WERE HORRIBLY MISLEADING. AND I AM SADDENED OF PEOPLE BOUGHT THE RHETORIC. ON THE BILL OF GOODS THEY WERE SOLD. I FELT THAT I CONTINUE TO FOLLOW MY COLLEAGUE ON THIS FLOOR WHO YOU KNOW CONTINUES TO CLAIM THAT WE ARE BOUGHT AND SOLD BY AN ENTITY AND I HAVE TO SAY ONCE AGAIN PARTICULARLY AFTER THE RESOLUTION TALK ABOUT SIXTY NINETEEN THAT I'M NOT FOR SALE. AND I HAVE TO GET MY CUP FOR SADDAM TO FOLLOW THAT ANYMORE. THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FUNDS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION WHICH STRUCK ME AS A NON PROFIT EXECUTIVE. PRIOR TO BECOMING ELECTED I WAS STRUCK AT THE PERCENTAGE OF THIS NONPROFIT FUNDING THAT COMES FROM. TO DONORS. IN NONPROFIT ACCOUNTING IRS RULES ARE VERY PARTICULAR ABOUT THE SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AND YOU CAN'T HAVE ALL YOUR CA FUNDING COMING FROM A SINGLE SOURCE BECAUSE THE IN INFERENCE IS THAT THAT IS SIMPLY A WAY IN WHICH THE- THE PRIVATE ORGANIZATION IS GETTING A TAX WRITE OFF. ON BY HAVING THE NONPROFIT QUOTE UNQUOTE THAT THEY HAVE COMPLETE ON JURISDICTION OVER AND SO THAT WAS AN ISSUE THAT WE BROUGHT UP REPEATEDLY DURING THE COMMITTEE IT WAS A CONCERN. SEPARATE FROM WHAT THE AMERICAN CAN BE FUN CLAIM THEY WERE DOING IT WAS REALLY WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE A TRUE INDEPENDENT NOT FOR PROFIT ORGANIZATION. NOT BEING STEERED CALL STEERAGE NONPROFIT ACCOUNTING. LOOK IT UP. ARMED WITH 82% OF THEIR FUNDS COMING FROM THE LARGEST I OFFICE COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA SO THAT WAS A PROBLEM IN TERMS OF REALLY DETERMINE WHETHER THEY WERE INDEPENDENT. NUMBER TWO BALANCE BILLING. IS AN ISSUE THAT WE HAVE TO GUARD AGAINST ON THE REGULAR. IT'S NOT ABOUT NOT ALLOWING A PRIVATE ENTITIES TO EARN PROFIT. IT'S WHO THEY'RE GOING TO EARN THE PROFIT ON THE BACKS OF AND MAKING SURE THAT THESE VULNERABLE PATIENTS. WHO DO RELY ON THEIR ABILITY TO DIAL SITES FREQUENTLY BUT IT'S NOT BALANCED ON THEIR BACK. THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FUND AS I RECALL DIDN'T OPERATE DIALYSIS CLINICS INDEPENDENTLY SO IT'S NOT ABOUT THE LIMITATION OF CLINICS THAT ANOTHER MISSTATEMENT. IT'S ABOUT BALANCE BILLING AND WHO COVERS THE COST TO GO ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT THEIR INSURANCE ALREADY COVERS. AND SO HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES AS A RESULT OF THIS BILL WILL BE REQUIRED TO COVER PATIENTS WHOSE PREMIUMS HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN PID BY THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FUN OR SOMEONE ORGANIZATIONS. FOR AWHILE SAY IT AGAIN. THE ACTORS ON THOSE TV COMMERCIALS THE DIALYSIS PATIENTS THAT WE SAW WHO TOOK THEIR TIME TO COME UP HERE WILL NOT LOSE. A MINUTE. OF THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO RECEIVE DIALYSIS SERVICES. BECAUSE HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE REQUIRED TO COVER THAT EXPENSE. YOU KNOW A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO FOR MEDI CAL WHEN WE HAD TO CUT MEDI CAL WE COULDN'T GET AGREEMENT ON THE BUDGET WHEN THE BUDGET REQUIRE TWO THIRDS VOTE. THE LEGISLATURE CUT MEDI CAL SERVICES. WE LIMITED WHAT MEDI CAL PATIENTS THAN THE FREQUENCY OF THE VISIT A MEDI CAL PATIENTS AT HALF TO SEVEN TIMES PER MONTH. THAT INCLUDED DIALYSIS PATIENTS. AND SO IN OUR INABILITY TO GET A BUDGET THROUGH BOTH HOUSES WE COMPROMISE THE LIVES OF DIALYSIS PATIENTS IN A VERY DIRECT WAY THOSE WHO RECEIVE MEDICARE HOW QUICKLY WE FORGET THIS BILL IS AN IMPROVEMENT OF STATUS QUO. IT ELIMINATES BALANCE BILLING WHICH IS A BAD THING FOR THE PUBLIC SECTOR FOR PATIENTS AND AGAIN IT WILL REQUIRE THE HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES PROVIDE THE COVERAGE FOR ALL OF THOSE REASONS I'LL BE VOTING HI ON AB TWENTY NINETY TO NINETY. SENATOR GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE IN OPPOSITION OF AB TWO NINETY THIS BILL WAS SIGNIFICANTLY AMENDED AND APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE AND WE'RE TOLD THAT THE MINUTES WERE MADE BETTER IN IT WOULD PROTECT THE THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED PATIENTS THAT WE HAVE MOSTLY FOR MINORITY MAJORITY DISTRICTS AND THE POOR THEY CAN'T AFFORD SOME OF THE BENEFITS THAT COME WITH DIALYSIS TREATMENT AT IT DOESN'T DO THAT IT ACTUALLY COME LOOSE THE SITUATION EVEN MORE. AND YOU KNOW WHEN I HEAR MY COLLEAGUES SAY THAT NO ONE'S GONNA LOSE THEIR BENEFITS AND THE AMERICAN CAN DEFEND IS GOING TO STAY IN CALIFORNIA. THAT'S JUST NOT TRUE IF YOU OPERATE ANY NONPROFIT OR A BUSINESS. AND JUST A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF YOUR ASSETS ARE IN CALIFORNIA AND CALIFORNIA IS CREATING SOMETHING THAT COULD CAUSE YOU. TO LOSE YOUR ENTIRE NATIONAL STATUS AS AN ORGANIZATION THEN YOU JUST. TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND CUT IT LOOSE AND SO THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE AMERICAN CAN DEFEND IS GOING TO DO. YES INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE REQUIRED TO COVER THIS AND HOPEFULLY PEOPLE THAT ARE WAITING ON DIALYSIS. THAT ARE BEING COVERED UNDER THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FIND NOW WILL SURVIVE THE THREE TO SIX MONTHS PROCESS TO GET. THEIR INSURANCE TO APPROVE IT AND THINGS WILL GO SMOOTHLY BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT VOTING FOR THIS BILL WILL STOP. THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FUND FROM OPERATING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND IT'S NOT A THREAT IT'S JUST LOOKING AT IT FROM A BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE AND SAYING YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO LOOK OUT FOR THE OTHER FORTY NINE STATES AND THE PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE. AND IF THIS IS GOING TO CAUSE A PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA THEN WE WILL JUST STEM. CUT LOOSE AND I HAVE REALLY GREAT CONCERNS BECAUSE THERE ARE THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED PEOPLE THAT NEED THIS SERVICE IN ORDER TO STAY ALIVE. IF YOU HAVE NOT VISITED A DIALYSIS CENTER IN YOUR DISTRICT I WOULD ASK YOU TO DO THAT. WHEN I WAS ASKED TO GO I REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO GO BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE. WHAT I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA SEE AND WHEN I WENT INTO THE DIALYSIS CENTER IT WASN'T ANYTHING LIKE I THOUGHT. THEY WERE YOUNG PEOPLE. THEY WERE TEENAGERS THERE WERE MADE IT MIDDLE AGED INDIVIDUALS THERE WERE MOMS THERE WERE MORE VETERANS. THEY WERE JUST PEOPLE TRYING TO STAY ALIVE IN WHEN THEY EAT SOMETHING THEY HAVE TO GO IN TWO OR THREE TIMES A WEEK FOR SEVERAL HOURS A DAY. AND THE STAFF IS REALLY FRIENDLY AND I JUST THINK THAT THAT TIME ATTACKING THIS PARTICULAR INDUSTRY. CAUSES THE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS TO OUR- CONSTITUENTS. AND I REALLY DO BELIEVE WHAT THE AMERICAN CAN DEFEND SAYS. THAT THEY WILL CUT THEIR LOSSES IN CALIFORNIA AND WE WILL HAVE. AN INTERRUPTION OF SERVICE AND POSSIBLY NOT HAVE SERVICE. FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DESPERATELY IN NEED OF THIS SERVICE. AND I THINK WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT OUR CONSTITUENTS. I'M SURE ONE OF THOSE THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED PEOPLE LIVES IN MY DISTRICT. AND THE REST OF THEM ROOM SOMEONE LIVING YOUR DISTRICT AND I WOULD JUST ASK THAT YOU VOTE NO ON THIS BILL. IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SEEING NONE SENATOR LEYVA YOU MAY CONCLUDE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT THANK YOU FOR THE ROBUST A CONVERSATION AND DEBATE IF SOME OF IT IS NOT ACCURATE. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE I WANT TO START WITH ALL OF THE INACCURACIES I THINK THE FIRST THING THAT I WANT TO START WITH IS TO THE SENATOR IN TEMECULA WONDERING WHY HE'S SO AFRAID OF UNIONS AND SO AFRAID OF LABOR. AND FOR MYSELF AS SOMEONE WHO SPENT THIRTY YEARS AS EITHER A UNION MEMBER AS SOMEONE WHO RAN MY OWN LOCAL UNION WHO IS THE PRESENT THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION. LABOR DOESN'T SUPPORT ME I AM LABOR SO I TAKE OFFENSE WHEN YOU SAY THAT LABOR OWNS ANY OF US I AM LABOR. OUR I DON'T SEE HOW PATIENTS ARE PUT IN IN HARM'S WAY IN THIS BILL NO ONE IS GOING TO LOSE COVERAGE BUT THAT'S A FEAR TALK TALKING POINT RIGHT WE WANT TO SCARE PEOPLE. THAT'S WHAT THE TWO BIGGEST COMPANIES OF DIALYSIS HAVE DONE IS THERE RUNNING THESE COMMERCIALS AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM LA ALLUDED TO AND THEY'RE SCARING PEOPLE. THIS IS NOT ABOUT THEM BEING ABLE TO RECOUP THEIR COSTS THIS IS ABOUT THE MAKING MILLIONS AND MILLIONS IN PROFITS OFF THE BACKS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE SICK AND YES MIGHT DIE IF THEY DON'T HAVE DIALYSIS. WE TALK ABOUT WORLD IN POOR AREAS SOME OF YOU MAY NOT KNOW THAT THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL IS IN ONE OF THE POOREST AND MOST RURAL AREAS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I DON'T THINK HE WOULD DO ANYTHING AS A DOCTOR. TO HARM THOSE PEOPLE. AND SHAME ON THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FOUNDATION. IF THEY'RE GOING TO LEAVE AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THE PATIENTS THAT THEY ARE SUPPOSEDLY. SO THEY CARE SO MUCH ABOUT. I THINK THAT. I DON'T MIND PEOPLE MAKE A PROFIT I DON'T THINK ANY OF US DO I THINK WHAT WE DON'T LIKE IS THAT WHEN THEY POLITICIZE THIS ISSUE AND THEY PUT HATE PROFITS BEFORE PATIENTS. AB TWO NINETY. IS A BILL MANY OF YOU KNOW I CARRIED THIS BILL ASHER IS A BETTER BILL THAN THE BILL THAT I CARRIED IT OFFERS MORE PROTECTIONS FOR EVERYONE. THERE'S NO REASON TO VOTE NO ON THIS BILL. NO ONE IS GOING OUT OF BUSINESS NO PATIENTS ARE NOT GOING TO RECEIVE DIALYSIS BUT IT IS GOING TO PUT SOME PEOPLE IN CHECK.

ASSEMBLY BILL SIX TWENTY NINE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER SMITH AN ACT RELATED CRIME VICTIMS AND MAKING A PREPARATION THEREFORE SENATOR JACKSON THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES ARE RISE TO PRESENT THIS MEASURE ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY WOMAN CHRISTY SMITH. THIS MEASURE IS ALSO A WOMEN'S CAUCUS PRIORITY BILL THERE WILL HELP VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING REBUILD THEIR LIVES AS WE BECOME AWARE MORE AND MORE OF THIS. INCREDIBLE EPIDEMIC OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING WE START RECOGNIZING THE IMPACTS THAT THIS HOUSE ON THE LIVES OF ITS VICTIMS WHILE THEY LOSE THEIR FREEDOM THEY ALSO LOSE THEIR ABILITY TO WORK A REGULAR JOB. AND RECEIVE LEGAL. AND AN APPROPRIATE WAGES AFTER VICTIM HAS ESCAPED THIS TERRIBLE TRAFFICKING SITUATION THE JOURNEY BACK TOWARDS NORMALCY IS ALSO INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT. VICTIMS MUST GRAPPLE WITH FINDING HOUSING AND OTHER BASIC NECESSITIES ON TOP OF SEEKING TREATMENT FOR MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. THEY MAY FEEL ISOLATED IN BE ISOLATED FROM FAMILY OR FRIENDS THEY MAY HAVE HAD TO RESETTLE FAR AWAY FROM WHERE THEY WERE INITIALLY TRAFFICKED IN ORDER TO FEEL SAFE. THE WAY CURRENT REGULATIONS ARE WRITTEN DOES NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THE CIRCUMSTANCES THESE VICTIMS IN JUROR WHILE BEING TRAFFICKED NOR THE CHALLENGES FACED IN RECOVERY. THIS MEASURE OR I SHOULD SAY THE CALIFORNIA VICTIMS COMPENSATION PROGRAM PROVIDES ASSISTANCE TO VICTIMS WHO HAVE SUFFERED PHYSICAL INJURY. OR THE THREAT OF PHYSICAL INJURIES RESULTING VIOLENT CRIME INCLUDING COVERING UNFORESEEN EXPENSES SUCH AS MEDICAL BILLS MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT FUNERAL AND BURIAL EXPENSES. AS WELL AS INCOME LOSS HOWEVER UNDER TODAY'S LAWS HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS MAY NOT BE COMPENSATED FOR INCOME LOSS. THIS MEASURE WILL ALLOW THE CALIFORNIA VICTIM COMPENSATION BOARD TO COMPENSATE UMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS FOR ECONOMIC LOSSES INCURRED AS A RESULT OF BEING TRAFFICKED. NOW WE CERTAINLY CAN'T UNDO THE HARM THAT EXISTS IN IS CREATED BY HUMAN TRAFFICKING. TO THESE VICTIMS BUT WE CAN PROVIDE THEM WITH ASSISTANCE RECOGNIZE THE ADVERSITY THEY'VE UNDERGONE AND HELP THEM TO BE ABLE TO MOVE ON WITH THEIR LIVES SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER JACKSON DISCUSSION AND DEBATE SENATOR NIELSEN. THAT A PRESENT LADY'S GENTLEMAN SENATE. SHORT OF. DEATH AND- VERY SEVERE PHYSICAL INJURY. THERE ARE FEW CRIMES MORE HARMFUL. THEN THIS TRAFFIC. IT IS IN FACT A LIFETIME SENTENCE THE VICTIM. EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT TO HARM PHYSICALLY. EMOTIONALLY AND MENTALLY AND IT'S A TOTALLY DESTRUCTIVE. CRIME PERPETRATED ON MANY MANY INNOCENT VICTIMS. IT'S KIND OF A CRIME THAT IS NOT MUCH NOTICED THERE BEEN SOME MOVIES ABOUT IT IF YOU WATCH THE MOVIES. THE KIND OF MOVIES YOU DREAM ABOUT. AND YOU PRAY ABOUT THAT NONE OF YOUR LOVED ONES WHATEVER BE SUBJECTED TO SUCH TRAGEDY. IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT ANYONE COULD DO SUCH THINGS TO FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS. BUT IT IS AN INCREASING PROBLEM. WE NEED TO HELP THESE VICTIMS TO THE DEGREE THAT WE CAN. THIS IS ONLY TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. BUT IT IS A BREAKTHROUGH. THIS WARNING OF A YES VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER NIELSEN FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SEEING AND HEARING NO ANSWER JACK'S WHICH LIKE CLOTHES YES AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM MY GOOD COLLEAGUE THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR COMPENSATION.

THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES I'M PLEASE PRESENT AB FIFTY NINE WHICH BUILDS ON OUR STATE'S COMMITMENT TO INCREASE CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AND VTER TURNOUT AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE. WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS THIS BILL SIMPLY AS THE LIST OF CONSIDERATIONS AS TO WHERE VOTE CENTER SHOULD BE PLACED. AS TO THE THAT LIST COLLEGE CAMPUSES MAKES ALL THE SENSE IN THE WORLD THAT A VOTE SO SHOULD BE A COLLEGE CAMPUS IF. CALIFORNIA'S YOUNG PEOPLE ARE LIKE MY CHILREN SOMETIMES THEY FORGET THAT ELECTIONS COMING SOMETIMES THEY LOSE THEIR BALLOT SOMETIMES THAT THEY DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO JUST SHORTLY BEFORE THE ELECTION. AND SO A COLLEGE CAMPUS IS AN IDEAL LOCATION BUT THIS BILL DOESN'T REQUIRE PLACE ON A COLLEGE CAMPUS SIMPLY AS IT. AS ONE OF THE MANY CONSIDERATIONS AS TO WHERE VOTE CENTER SHOULD BE PLACED AYE REGION I VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER OF BURKE MEMBERS DISCUSSION AND DEBATE SENATOR GORGEOUS. TO PULL MADAM PRESENT FAQ COULD POSE A QUESTION TO. THE AIRPORT MANAGER. NUMBER WE TAKE A QUESTION. I'M HAPPY AS CAN BE THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU SENATOR BORDERS PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU. UNDER CURRENT LAW ARE THERE ANY RESTRICTIONS BY COUNTY OFFICIALS ALLOWING VOTING TO TAKE PLACE ON UNIVERSITY THINGS RIGHT NOW. I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY PROHIBITION OF BOTH CENTERS BEING LOCATED ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES BUT THE VOTE CENTER CONCEPT IS A RELATIVELY NEW CONCEPT IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY N. BEYOND COUNTIES WILL BE MANY COUNTIES WILL BE HAVING VOTE CENTERS VERSES VOTING PRECINCTS. SO THIS IS A NEW CONCEPT IN THIS SIMPLY ENSHRINES IN LAW THAT AMONG THE CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE REGISTER VOTERS TO CONSIDER IS A BOTH CENTER ON A COLLEGE CAMPUS AND THAT'S IN THAT'S REALLY I THINK MY CONCERN HERE IS THAT. ON ITS FACE IT'S BUT NINE BUT THE POWER ALREADY IS VESTED BY IN THE COUNTY OFFICIALS TO CREATE VOTING PLACES WHERE THERE ARE CONGREGATIONS IN LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE SO. I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE EFFICACY OF THIS LEGISLATION REALLY IS. THROUGH THE CHAIR I THINK IT'S WITHOUT OBJECTION I THINK IT'S TO SPECIFICALLY. ADVISE THE COUNTY REGISTRARS THE THIS IS AMONG THE CONSIDERATIONS ARE MANY CONSIDERATIONS BUT SO THAT THERE IS IT'S NOT AMBIGUOUS WAS NOT LOST ON THEM THAT THIS IS AMONG THE CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU BOTH CENTER HERTZBERG IF I CAN MADAM PRESIDENT AS THE JOINT AUTHORED WAS SENATOR ALLEN ON THIS MEASURE SOME YEARS AGO THE CRATE VOTE CENTERS LOOKING AT COLORADO IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS THERE WERE AND HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE NUMBER OF THE VARIOUS REGISTRARS US SOME QUESTIONS AND I THINK THAT THIS LAW MAKES SENSE IN THE SENSE THAT IT GIVES MORE DIRECTION TO REGISTRARS VOTER REGISTRARS OF FROM THIS LEGISLTURE AS TO WHAT IT MEANT BY THE LAW WAS AT THREE FIFTY I CAN'T FOR THE BILL NUMBER WAS BUT ANY EVENT THE BILL THAT WE PUT TOGETHER AND I THINK IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND SO I.

THANK YOU CENTER HERTZBERG MEMBERS IN THEIR- DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SEEING AND HEARING MANSON OR HUMBER NUMBER WHICH I TO CLOSE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT THIS MAKES ALL THE SENSE IN THE WORLD.

TO APPLY FOR GRANTS AND ENSURE THAT THE FUNDS ARE USED FOR SUCCESSFUL YOU DIVERSION PROGRAMS FOR EXAMPLE THIS BILL WILL ALLOW NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO APPLY FOR GRANTS AND INCREASES THE MAXIMUM AWARD AMOUNT TO TWO MILLION. THESE CHANGES ARE IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT THESE FUNDS REACH ALL PARTS OF THE STATE.

THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. BACK LAST NOVEMBER. THE BORDERLINE SHOOTING TOOK TWELVE LIVES INNOCENT LIVES FROM US IN THOUSAND OAKS. AB TWELVE IS FOR THOSE TWELVE PEOPLE. IT WILL NOT BRING THEM BACK. THEY WILL NOT BRING JUSTICE BECAUSE JUSTICE IS FLEETING. WITH THE. ON STREETS TRAGEDY LIKE WE HAD THERE. BUT IT HOPEFULLY WILL HELP US TURN THE PAGE AND START TO MAKE OUR LAWS BETTER TO PREVENT THESE KINDS OF TRAGEDIES IN THE FUTURE. WE'VE WE'VE SEEN IMPASSES REACHED WHEN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN VISITED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT IN. MAYBE NOT SUBJECT TO A FIFTY ONE FIFTY OR SOME KIND OF DETENTION BUT BASED ON THEIR HISTORY I THEIR ON THE APPS LIST OR- OR SOME OTHER INCIDENT IN THIS CASE A YOUNG MAN WHOSE PUNCHING HOLES IN HIS WALLS. THREATENING HIS MOTHER. AT HISTORY OF VIOLENCE AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND YET. WE LEFT HIM WITH HIS GUN. THIS BILL WILL HOPEFULLY GIVE THE COURTS ARE ROLE IN DEALING WITH GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS TO GIVE THEM SOME DISCRETION EXTEND THE TIME FRAME BETWEEN ONE AND FIVE YEARS FOR A GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING OVER ORDER AFTER NOTICING HEARING. SO NOW THAT A DENIAL OF DUE PROCESS RIGHTS. BUT CERTAINLY WITH MORE JUDICIAL DISCRETION THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. WE HOPE THIS BILL WILL ALLEVIATE A BURDEN ON COURTS AS WELL IN THE LAWN FORCING THE BUREAUCRACY BUT ALSO ON FAMILIES WHO HAVE TO FACE. AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE. HEALTHY BRING SOME COMFORT TO THE VICTIMS. THIS BILL ALSO MAKES THREE OTHER IMPORTANT CLARIFYING CHANGES TO MAKE GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS MORE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE. BY ALLOWING AGENCIES TO FILE IN LIEU OF NAMING INDIVIDUAL OFFICERS BY ALLOWING A REQUESTING OFFICER TO SERVE THE ORDER. AND CLEAR FIND ALLOWANCES FOR SALE AND TRANSFER DO NOT APPLY IN EMERGENCY CONTACTS. WE CAN NEVER SAY THAT ONE LAW WOULD HAVE STOPPED A PARTICULAR SHOOTING. I THINK SOMETIMES IT IS BEYOND US. BUT IT IS OUR DUTY TO DO EVERYTHING WE HAVE THE POWER TO DO UNDER OUR LAW. SOME COMFORT. TO THE VICTIMS AND SOME SAFETY. THOSE MILLION THE SCHOOL KIDS AROUND THIS COUNTRY WHO FEAR IT SOOTING MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE AND YET. THE RISK OF THAT HAPPENING. IS SO MINUTE. BUT IT DOMINATES OUR PUBLIC PSYCHE RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE TO MAKE CHANGES HERE TO TURN THE PAGE ON THIS GUN VIOLENCE DEBATE WE HOPE WITH THE BI PARTISAN MOVE WE MADE WITH AB TWELVE WE CAN START TO TURN THAT PAGE AND BEGIN TO HEAL. WITH THAT RESPECTFULLY ASK PRIVATE THANK YOU CENTER STERN DISCUSSION AND DEBATE SENATOR NIELSEN. NOT A PRESIDENT LAYS DOWN THE SENATE WHERE THIS IS STAND ALONE BILL. I WOULD FIND SAMARITAN. BUT IT IS NOT. IN FACT IRONICALLY IT FLIES IN THE FACE OF THE CORE ELEMENTS OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM THAT WE'RE IN THE THROES OF NOW. INCLUDING DIMINISHING THE CONSEQUENCES FOR ONE WHO USES. A GUN IN THE COMMISSION OF A CRIME. BECAUSE WE'RE NOT TO BE IN TWO ENHANCEMENTS ANYMORE. AND GETTING PEOPLE OUT OF PRISON EARLIER IS THE GOAL. NOT LATER. NOT ATER BECAUSE OF ENHANCEMENTS LIKE USE A GUN GO TO PRISON THAT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA VOTED FOR A LONG TIME AGO. PROVIDED TO YEAR ENHANCEMENT THE USE A GUN. PERIOD. THE EXTENDING THE RESTRAINING ORDER. TWO FIVE YEARS. WELL WOULD THAT HELP IN SOME WAY I WOULD ASSUME IT WOULD BUT AGAIN I'M ARGUING IN THE CONTEXT OF ALL OF THE OTHER. ATTEMPTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE. TO STOP GUN VIOLENCE. CHICAGO FOR EXAMPLE MURDER CAPITAL OF AMERICA. STRICTEST GUN LAWS IN AMERICA. IN EVERY DAY WERE COMING UP WITH NEW IDEAS TO DIMINISH THE CONSEQUENCES FOR CRIME INCLUDING. WITH GUNS. AS I NOTED A LITTLE BIT AGO. IT HASN'T EVEN BEEN A PRIORITY. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO TAKE GUNS AWAY FROM THOSE WHO WERE PROHIBITED FROM HAVING GUNS. A BACKLOG WAS OVER TWENTY THOUSAND GUNS NOW NOT GUTS. THAT WOULD BE INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE PROHIBITED FROM HAVING GUNS IN ALMOST EVERY ONE OF THOSE WOULD HAVE MORE THAN ONE GUN. YOU EXTRAPOLATE THE NUMBER OF GUNS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN CONFISCATED THAT BY LAW SHOULD HAVE BEEN A LONG TIME AGO YEARS AGO. SO THIS MAY BE FEEL GOOD. BUT DON'T BE DECEIVED. TAKEN IN CONTEXT THIS AIN'T GOING TO HELP VERY MUCH. LIMA NOVO. THANK YOU SENATOR NELSON MEMBERS FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SEEING AND HEARING NONE CENTER STERN PLEASE CLOSE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT WITH WITH DUE RESPECT SOME. I DON'T HAVE THE POWER TO REINVENT THE STATE A CALIFORNIA LAW HERE BEFORE YOU ON THE FLOOR TODAY. BUT I THINK THIS DOES MORE THAN A LITTLE BIT. THE KIND OF DISCRETION GIVEN TO THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM TO EXTEND THESE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS WHICH WE'VE DENIED LAW ENFORCEMENT THE TOOL OF USING FOR FAR TOO LONG. WE THINK CAN MAKE A MEANINGFUL DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE'S LIVES.

ASSEMBLY BILL THREE FIFTY FOUR BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK SILVA AN ACT RELATING TO SCHOOL MEALS SENATOR RUBIO THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT TODAY I RISE TO PRESENT AB THREE FIFTY FOUR ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK SILVA. AB THREE FIFTY FOUR REQUIRES SCHOOLS THAT DO NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE NATIONAL SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM OR THE FEDERAL SCHOOL BREAKFAST PROGRAM TO ANNUALLY REPORT AN ALTERNATIVE MEAL PROGRAM TO ENSURE STUDENTS THE NEEDS ARE PROVIDED WITH ONE ADEQUATE AND NUTRITIOUS MEALS EACH DAY. THIS BILL ALSO ENSURES AT SCHOOL SITES HAVE ADEQUATE SPACE FOR STUDENTS TO CONSUME THOSE MEALS ALL STUDENTS DESERVE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO RESOURCES AND ENSURE TO ENSURE THEIR SUCCESS IMPROPER NUTRITION. IS ONE OF THEM WHAT THIS BILL WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT SCHOOLS THAT DO NOT PARTICIPATE IN THESE PROGRAMS ARE STILL PROVIDING ADEQUATE MEALS FOR STUDENTS SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YA BOY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO MEMBERS DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. FURTHERMORE LOCK. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT THIS IS THE SECOND YEAR NOW THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET ALL. OF THE AUDITED FINANCIAL REPORTS FOR THE NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY AUDITED SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN. CALIFORNIA AND WE SHOULD BE RELEASING THE INFORMATION SOON BUT- THE BAD NEWS IS THAT THERE. A MIND UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICIT HAS GROWN 40% IN THE LAST YEAR. SO WE HAVE TO PAY REAL CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY. OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS BUT I WAS DOING A LITTLE ANALYSIS OF THE POPULATION OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS A HUNDRED NINETEEN. SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN CALIFORNIA REPRESENT POPULATIONS OF LESS THAN A THOUSAND PEOPLE. BETWEEN ONE THOUSAND AND TEN THOUSAND IT'S TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THEN BETWEEN TEN THOUSAND ONE IN ELEVEN THOUSAND IT'S A FIFTEEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS. BETWEEN ELEVEN THOUSAND ONE IN TWENTY THOUSAND IT'S NINETY NINE SCHOOL DISTRICT SO. FOR JUST POPULATIONS THAT SMALL THE REPRESENTS 55% OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN CALIFORNIA. I CAN GIVE YOU THE BREAKDOWN OF THE REST BUT THERE ARE SO FEW THAT REPRESENT MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PUPILS YOU HAVE THE BIG THE BIG BOYS LIKE KERN HIGH WHICH HAS SIX HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND. SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND. SAN DIEGO UNIFIED ONE MILLION NINETY FIVE. AND THEN L. A. U. S. T. FOUR MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED ONE. BUT LA UNIFIED JUST LET THIS YEAR ALONE IS HAD TO RAISE THEIR LIABILITIES BY FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS WHICH REPRESENTS PROBABLY THE- BOOK OF THE INCREASE. IN THE UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICITS SO I'LL YOU LOOK AT. THIS BIG BODY OF DATA AND YOU REALIZE THAT SMALL DISTRICTS RENDERMAN. AND LARGE DISTRICTS AROUND THE FINANCIAL BRINK SACRAMENTO CITY WHICH SERVES THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND STUDENTS. WILL BE OUT OF CASH IN TWO MONTHS. AND WE ACT LIKE EVERYTHING IS FINE AND THAT WE CAN ADD TO THEIR BURKE. INSTEAD OF LIGHTNING THEIR LOAD. SO COLLEAGUES I'M BEWILDERED DOES A CPA I'M LOOKING AT THE DATA AND I'M REALLY GETTING VERY CONCERNED WE HAVE SERIOUS SYSTEMIC ISSUES TO RESOLVE IN OUR SCHOOL SYSTEMS AND WE'RE DEALING WITH MEAL PROGRAM REPORTING.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. COLLEAGUES AB NINE SIXTY SEVEN. INCLUDES ALL LOCAL EIGHT EDUCATION AGENCYCOMMUNITIES IN THE EL CAP PROCESS AND SUPPORTS THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR'S GOAL OF ALIGNING CHARTER SCHOOL TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY WITH THAT OF ALL STATE ELEAZAR. FOR FIVE YEARS CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN TASKED WITH DEVELOPING DATA DRIVEN AND RIGOROUS LOCAL ENGAGEMENT AND MEANINGFUL STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESSES IN THE EL CAP DEVELOPMENT AND DELIVERY. THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA REQUIRES THAT ALLEY ETS CONSULT WITH PARENTS STUDENTS AND COMMUNITY AS THEY DEVELOP THEIR AL CAPS AND STUDIES HAVE SHOWN. THAT SCHOOLS WHO HAVE MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENT WITH THEIR COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN THE MOST SUCCESSFUL AT ELIMINATING ACHIEVEMENT GAPS. THIS IS A PROCESS THAT ALL PUBLICLY FUNDED SCHOOLS NEED TO HAVE TO BE ABLE TO BEST SERVE THEIR PARENT AND STUDENT POPULATION. UNFORTUNATELY AT PRESENT NOT ALL PARENTS AND STUDENTS HAVE THE ABILITY IN THE MEANS TO ACCESS TO SCHOOL BOARDS AND PARTICIPATE IN THE EL CAP PROCESS AND NOT ALL SCHOOL BOARDS HOWEVER A BUS PROCESS. AB NINE SIX SEVEN RINGS CHARTER SCHOOLS INTO ALIGNMENT WITH ALL CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND PROVIDES THE AL CAPP. AS A UNIFORM AND STANDARD BASIS FOR COMPARISON TO MONITOR STUDENT OUTCOMES ACROSS THE EIGHT STATE PRIORITIES AND THE TARGETED SUBGROUPS ACROSS ALL PUBLIC SCHOOLS COLLEAGUES ASK FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND THEN I VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR DRAWS DISCUSSION AND DEBATE SENATOR NIELSEN. BETTER PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE THIS MAY BE WELL INTENDED. ORAL INTENDED INADVERTENTLY OR ADVERSELY PLACE BEFORE US TAKEN IN CONTEXT THOUGH I HAVE TO FEEL THAT IT'S NOT WELL INTENDED. WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN IN PROCESS FOR MANY MANY YEARS. EVEN DECADES. AS CHARTER SCHOOLS. RULES. PARENTS HAVE SEEN FIT TO ROLLER YOUTH IN CHARTER SCHOOLS. PARTICULARLY. IN AREAS WHERE THERE ARE CHALLENGES FOR THE FAMILIES. AND FOR THE STUDENTS IN FACT THERE'S BEEN A HUGE GROWTH. OF THOSE FAMILY SAYING NO. PUBLIC EDUCATION IS LET US DOWN IN OUR CHILDREN DOWN. WE'RE GOING TO PUT THEM IN THE CHARTER SCHOOLS THE CHARTER SCHOOLS OF GROWN. OUR CHILDREN WHICH PROSPERED. NOW WE DON'T TO DO TESTING ANYMORE BECAUSE PUBLIC EDUCATION WAS TOO EMBARRASSED. CONTINUED BOTTOM RATINGS WE WERE RECEIVING. BUT IT CERTAINLY WAS SOMETHING THAT PARENTS HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THAT THEIR CHILDREN DID BETTER. IN OTHER SETTINGS. AND WHAT THESE MINI SERIES OF BILLS OVER THE YEARS HAVE DONE. IS TO OPPOSE AS THIS ONE SPECIFICALLY DOES IMPOSE ON CHARTER SCHOOLS THE VERY SAME FACT DOORS THAT HAVE MADE OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION ESTABLISHMENT MEDIOCRE. IS THAT OUR HIGHEST STANDARD AND HOPE FOR OUR CHILDREN MEDIOCRITY. I THINK NOT. LET'S GIVE THESE PARENTS A CHOICE. THIS TRANSPARENCY. IS ACTUALLY MORE OF A COVER. FOR THE FAILURES OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS. THAT IT IS A NEED TO BE IMPOSED ON CHARTER SCHOOLS I URGE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER NIELSEN FURTHER DISCUSSION AND DEBATE SENATOR PORCHES. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I THINK MY COLLEAGUE HAD RAISE SOME VERY IMPORTANT AND SERIOUS POINTS. I THINK THE FACT THAT WE NEED CHARTER SCHOOLS BELIES THE FACT THAT MANY OF OUR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS HAVE NOT BEEN PERFORMING UP TO PAR AND I COME FROM AN AND A FAMILY OF EDUCATORS AND I MYSELF WAS AN EDUCATOR IN MY PREVIOUS CAPACITY. THIS IDEA THAT HOLDING. OUR CHARTER SCHOOLS JUNE EL CAP OR OTHER CRITERIA IN THE INTEREST OF DISCLOSURE I DON'T THINK IS PROPERLY REPRESENTING THE FAX. I'LL BE THE FIRST TO TELL YOU THAT I'VE VOTE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT CHARTER SCHOOLS BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE BY THE BROWN ACT. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT A PUBLIC INSTITUTION SHOULD CONDUCT ITSELF IN PRIVATE IN THAT SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PARENTS AND THOSE IN THE COMMUNITY. AND I EXPRESS THAT. I WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT ARE CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE BY THE BROWN ACT. AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF OTHER INSTANCES LIKE THAT WHERE WE NEED TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE BROUGHT UP TO PAR IN TERMS OF TRANSPARENCY IN MANDATORY DISCLOSURES. THAT WE HOLD TO OTHER INSTITUTIONS. BUT THE REASON WHY CHARTER SCHOOLS EXIST IS BECAUSE MANY OF OUR PRIVATE OR PUBLIC AGE INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT PERFORMING PROPERLY IN THIS IS A SAFETY GAP. THIS IS A SAFETY VALVE THAT HELPS OUR COMMUNITY I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A WAY THAT WE CAN SELF CORRECT NOT ONLY THROUGH CHARTER SCHOOLS WITH A LEARN THE LESSONS LEARNED. FROM THEIR EXPERIENCE INTO THE PUBLIC SETTING. SO THE IDEA THAT THIS IS ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY IN THIS IS ABOUT MAKING CERTAIN THAT PARENTS ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE PROCESS. I'LL BE THE FIRST TO TELL YOU THAT IN MY BACKYARD I WAS A PART OF AN ORGANIZATION THAT WANT TO CREATE A CHARTER SCHOOL THAT EVEN PROMOTED THE IDEA OF MAKING CERTAIN THAT UNION. FACULTY UNITES FACULTY WERE PART OF THIS NEW CHARTER ENTITY. THIS GOES FAR BEYOND THAT. I DON'T CARE HOW YOU GHOST THROUGH WITH BENIGN LANGUAGE. THIS IS A DID THIS IS A DESIRE BY FOLKS WHO OPPOSE CHARTER SCHOOLS. TO ME TO BRING IT DOWN PERFORMANCE WITH INTRUSIVE AND OVERLY BURDENSOME REGULATIONS. TO CREATE A PLAYING FIELD THAT IS COMMENSURATE WITH THE BUREAUCRACY THAT WE SEE IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS I THINK THAT'S- THAT'S A TRAVESTY IN MY OPINION. I WOULD ENCOURAGE MY CALL IS COLLEAGUES TO SEE THIS AS IT IS. A MEASURE TO BRING BACK BRING DOWN CHARTER SCHOOLS TO A POINT WHERE THERE IS NO. DISPARITY IN PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES AS WE HAVE SEEN IN THE PAST. THANK YOU SENATOR BORDERS FOR THE DISCUSSION AND DEBATE CENTER GLAZER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS YOU KNOW IN JANUARY WE HAD A DISCUSSION ON THE FLOOR ABOUT THE BROWN ACTON OPEN MEETINGS AND LA OUT OF THE EARLY DAYS OF OUR LEGISLATIVE YEAR WITH. A COMPROMISE WAS FORGED BETWEEN THE PUBLIC CHARTER COMMUNITY PUBLIC SCHOOL COMMUNITY AND LEGISLATIVE IN STATE LEADERS TO FIND COMMON GROUND AND PLACES WHERE WE COULD CUT AND THE WAR AND TRY TO COME TOGETHER AND TOGETHER WE DID PASS LEGISLATION. TO PUT THOSE REQUIREMENTS ON PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOLS IN WHEN. WE HAD THE DEBATE ON THIS FLOOR I TALKED ABOUT I HOPE THAT THIS WAS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO FIND PLACES WE CAN COME TOGETHER. AND NOT CONTINUE THIS PERPETUAL WAR BETWEEN THESE DIFFERENT INTEREST GROUPS AND YET NOW WE HAVE THIS BILL BEFORE US. AND WHAT STRIKES ME MORE THAN ANYTHING ABOUT LEGISLATION LIKE THIS IS THAT. IN CALIFORNIA TODAY WE HAVE OVER SEVEN HUNDRED PUBLIC SCHOOLS THAT ARE ONSIDERED FAILING SCHOOLS IN OUR STATE OVER SEVEN HUNDRED. AND THE AND THE NUMBER OF SCHOOLS IN LOW INCOME AREAS IN OUR STATE THAT ARE FAILING IT X. IT. EQUALS ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED PUBLIC SCHOOLS FIVE HUNDRED PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA IN LOW INCOME AREAS ARE FAILING. AND HOW MANY OF THOSE ARE CHARTER SCHOOLS PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOLS HOW MANY. LESS THAN TWENTY FIVE. LESS THAN TWENTY FIVE SO HERE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ANOTHER BURDEN ON PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT GO AGAINST THE FOUNDING PRINCIPLES OF OUR CHARTER SCHOOL COMMUNITY AND WE'RE SITTING HERE DEBATING AN OBLIGATION ON PUBLIC CHARTERS AND IGNORING THE BIG PICTURE IN OUR STATE WHICH IS THAT WE HAVE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS THAT ARE FAILING IN OUR STATE AND WHERE IS THE DEBATE. WHERE IS THE CONVERSATION. ABOUT THAT. WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY HEARINGS ABOUT THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY FLOOR DEBATES ABOUT THOSE HUNDREDS OF FAILING SCHOOLS NO WE DON'T HAVE THAT WE HAVE THE SHINY Là OBJECTS IN BILLS LIKE THIS THAT SAY LET'S PUT MORE BURDEN ON THE PUBLIC CHARTERS SOMEHOW THAT'S THE PROBLEM. THAT OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE FACING IN OUR STATE. AND IT IS NOT. A FAIR OBSERVATION ABOUT WHAT MATTERS TO OUR OUR SCHOOL COMMUNITY TODAY. IT'S THE SHINY OBJECT THAT SOMEHOW LET'S SAY HERE'S A PROBLEM LET'S TRY TO FIX IT WITH MORE BURDENS ON PUBLIC CHARTERS THAT'S NOT OUR OUR EDUCATIONAL PROBLEM IN OUR STATE TODAY AND WHERE IS THE DEBATE. ON THAT ISSUE. AND I SAID YOU COLLEAGUES WE DON'T HAVE A DEBATE ON THAT ISSUE WHY. TOO BIG TOO HURTFUL TO EMBARRASSING TO TALK ABOUT. ON THE FLOOR OF THIS LEGISLATURE IT SHOULDN'T BE THE REASON. AND YET WE HAVE A BILL LIKE THIS. WITH GOOD INTENTIONS BUT GOES AGAINST EVERYTHING WE TRIED TO ESTABLISH IN THE PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOL MOVEMENT TO GIVE SOME FLEXIBILITY. TO GET SOME CHOICE THE PARENTS TO SEE THEIR KIDS IN FAILING SCHOOLS AND SAY WHAT CAN I DO WHAT CHOICES DO I HAVE. AND THOSE PARENTS HAVE CHOICES TODAY YOU KNOW WHAT THAT CHOICES THE CHOICES TO GET UP EXTRA EARLY IN THE MORNING TO DRIVE THEIR KIDS TO A SCHOOL THAT MAY NOT BEING IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD. TO TAKE THEM OUT OF THEIR PEER GROUP BECAUSE THEY WANT TO GIVE THERE'S CHILD THAT ONE CHANCE TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS WORLD A GOOD EDUCATION. AND IT'S NOT HAPPENING TODAY AND SO THEY HAVE TO GET UP EARLY THEY HAVE TO HAVE AG ALOT ANGST IN THEIR LIFE. BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT OF MOVING THEIR CHILD OUT OF A PUBLIC SCHOOL IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT'S NOT WORKING FOR THEIR CHILD. AND WHAT WE DO HERE LEGISLATION LIKE THIS WE GIVE THE MORE OPPORTUNITIES. MORE OVERSIGHT MORE SCRUTINY NOW. WE GIVE THEM MORE COMPLEXITY MORE BURDENS. AND I SUGGEST TO YOU THAT THAT REALLY ISN'T SERVING OUR SCHOOLS. AND OUR STUDENTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT IS WHY. WITH THE BEST OF INTENTIONS I KNOW BY THE AUTHOR. I WILL CERTAINLY BE A NO VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER MEMBERS ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SEEING AND HEARING NONE SENATOR DRAWS YOU MAY CLOSE. YES SOME. I THINK THIS IS VERY SIMPLE.

THIS BILL ENSURES THAT WE CONFORM TO FEDERAL LAW AND WE CAN CONTINUE TO CLAIM FEDERAL FUNDS FOR CAN GAP. AND FINALLY THE BILL WILL EXTEND THE DATA FINAL PLANTATION OF THE C. C. R. RATE. STRUCTURE NOW IN THE FIFTH YEAR OF IMPLEMENTATION THE CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORMS ARE ALREADY INCREASING YOUTH PLACEMENT IN FAMILY SETTINGS. AND TRANSFORMING EXISTING GROUP HOMES IN TWO PLACES WHERE YOUTH. WHO ARE NOT ALREADY UP READY TO LIVE WITH FAMILIES CAN RECEIVE SHORT TERM INTENSIVE THERAPY AND SERVICES.

SENATOR ALLEN THE TIME AND PRESIDENT THIS BILL PLACES A MORATORIUM ON THE TROPHY HUNTING A BOBCATS UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. THE MORE TORRENT DOES ALLOW FOR EXEMPTIONS TO PROTECT HUMAN SAFETY PUBLIC PROPERTY AND LIVESTOCK. BUT CATS ARE NOT CLASSIFIED AS A GAME SPECIES BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AND ARE NOT KILLED FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. SINCE THE TRAPPING BAN IS NOW LAW BOBCATS ME ONLY BE HUNTED AS A TROPHY ANIMAL HUNTED FOR SPORT AND DISPLAYS SO THAT'S LIKE THE LAST STATEWIDE BOBCAT POPULATION SUSSMAN IS MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS OLD THIS BILL I SUPPORT THE NATIONAL WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT THREE BEST BASED UPON THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE RATHER THAN RUN RELIABLE DATA SOURCES INCLUDING. SELF REPORTED HUNTER SURVEYS. THE IDEA IS THAT AFTER TWENTY TWENTY FIVE UPON APPROPRIATION BY THE LEGISLATURE THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION IS PERMITTED UNDER THE BILL TO REOPEN THE BOBCAT HUNTING SEASON UPON DEVELOPING A BOBCAT MANAGEMENT PLAN THE USES CREDIBLE SCIENCE AN ECOSYSTEM BASED APPROACH TO INFORM DECISIONS REGARDING BOBCAT POPULATIONS INCLUDING A FAX ON THEIR PREY. DISEASE ABATEMENT AND BENEFITS TO FARMERS INCLUDING THE CONTROL OF INVASIVE SPECIES THE LA TIMES RECENTLY REPORTED THAT SCIENTIFIC STUDY SUGGESTS AN ALMOST ONE IN FOUR CHANCE THAT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MOUNTAIN LIONS CAN BECOME EXTINCT IN SANTA MONICA AND SANTA ANA MOUNTAINS WITHIN FIFTY YEARS WE MUST ENSURE THE BOBCATS A SIMILAR SPECIES ARE NOT.

ASSEMBLY BILL FIFTEEN OH FIVE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL ENACT WILLING TO CHARTER SCHOOLS. SENATOR LEYVA THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT GOOD EVENING AB FIFTEEN OH FIVE REFORMS THE CHARTER SCHOOL AUTHORIZATION OVERSIGHT APPEAL AND RENEWAL PROCESSES THIS BILL REPRESENTS AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE AUTHOR THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THE LABOR COMMUNITY AND THE CHARTER SCHOOL ASSOCIATION. AB FIFTEEN OH FIVE ACCOMPLISHES COMPREHENSIVE CHARTER SCHOOL REFORM BY ADDRESSING SEVERAL KEY ISSUES THE FIRST IS COMMUNITY IMPACT LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS AND ADMINISTRATORS NO THERE DISTRICTS AND STUDENTS BEST AND SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO DETERMINE WHICH CHARTERS CAN BEST SERVE THEIR STUDENTS. THIS BILL GIVES DISTRICTS GREATER FLEXIBILITY TO CONSIDER HOW A CHARTER% SCHOOL WILL IMPACT COMMUNITY AND TO DETERMINE WHETHER A PROPOSED CHARTER SCHOOL WILL SUBSTANTIALLY UNDERMINE EXISTING PROGRAMS AND SERVICES STUDENTS AB FIFTEEN OH FIVE ALSO ADDRESSES THE APPEAL PROCESS. IT CONTINUESTO ALLOW A FULL APPEAL TO THE COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION AND REFORMS THE APPEAL PROCESS AT THE STATE LEVEL ON THE ISSUE OF TEACHER CREDENTIALS IT ENSURES THAT CHARTER TEACHERS ARE QUALIFIED. THE BILL CLARIFIES THAT ALL TEACHERS IN CHARTER SCHOOLS MUST HOLD THE RECORD CREDENTIAL FOR THEIR ASSIGNMENT WITH A TRANSITION PERIOD VIRTUAL SCHOOLS HAVE ALSO BEEN ADDRESSED THIS BILL ESTABLISHES A TWO YEAR MORATORIUM ON NON CLASSROOM BASS CHARTERS WITH A COMMITMENT TO ADDRESS NEEDED REFORMS FOR THESE SCHOOLS DURING THAT TWO YEAR PERIOD. FINALLY THERE IS THE ISSUE OF ACCOUNTABILITY THE BILL REQUIRES CHARTER AUTHORIZES TO USE THE STATE ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM FOR THE BASIS OF CHARTER RENEW ALL HIGH PERFORMING CHARTERS WILL RECEIVE UP TO A SEVEN YEAR RENEWAL WELL LOW PERFORMING CHARTERS WILL EITHER. CLOSE OR RECEIVE A TWO YEAR RENEWAL. MIDDLE PERFORMING SCHOOLS WILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE A FIVE YEAR RENEWAL PERIOD. AB FIFTY NO FIVE IS A PRODUCT OF COUNTLESS HOURS AND COMPROMISE IT IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN ENSURING THAT WE HAVE A PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT SERVES THE NEEDS OF EVERY STUDENT. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON FIFTEEN OH FIVE. SENATOR JONES. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I RISE TONIGHT'S TO OPPOSE AB FIFTEEN OH FIVE. THIS BILL IS JUST ANOTHER ATTACK OF THE MANY THIS YEAR ON CHARTER SCHOOLS. I GUESS THE THEME OF TODAY'S US SENATE SESSION IS LET'S JUST TAKE AWAY PEOPLE'S LIBERTY. THIS BILL EFFECTIVELY IMPOSES A MORATORIUM ON CHARTER SCHOOLS NO IT IS NOT WIDE TO MEDIA COVERAGE ON THE ISSUE SAYS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A TRUCE BETWEEN CTA. AND THE CHARTER SCHOOLS. HOWEVER I URGE YOU TO READ THE LIST OF REGISTERED OPPOSITION AND SEE HOW MANY CHARTER SCHOOLS IN YOUR OWN DISTRICTS. ARE STILL OPPOSE AND ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO THIS BILL BECAUSE IT HALTS THEIR ABILITY TO EDUCATE STUDENTS. OFTENTIMES STUDENTS THAT NO ONE ELSE IS WILLING TO EDUCATE MEMBERS I ASK FOR A NO VOTE ON A. B. FIFTEEN OH FIVE. SENATOR STONE. THINK ABOUT A PRESIDENT. HE DOES OFTEN MENTION ON THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE THAT WE HAVE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY. IN THE WORLD. AND ONE THING THAT. WE NEED TO DO IF WE'RE GOING TO MAINTAIN. OUR SUCCESS AS A. DEMOCRACY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THRIVE AS A STATE IS HAVING A WELL EDUCATED WORK FORCE. I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THE SENATOR FROM MERENDA. WHO BROUGHT FORWARD A SUBJECT THAT IS RARELY TALK ABOUT ON THIS FLOOR. AND THAT IS OUR FEELING PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. IN RESPONSE TO OUR FAILING PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. WE HAVE HAD A CHARTER SCHOOL. MOMENTOUS THIS EXPANSION ASPECT HATED I CAN TELL YOU IN THE TWENTY SENATE DISTRICT WE HAVE A NUMBER OF CHARTER SCHOOLS WHERE THERE IS. FOUR DIGIT. WAITING LISTS FOR KIDS TO GET INTO THESE SCHOOLS. BECAUSE THEY ARE PERFORM THEIR PUBLIC SCHOOL COUNTERPARTS. BY A LARGE MAGNITUDE A LOT OF THOSE KIDS ARE GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL AND GOING TO FIRST CLASS UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. YOU KNOW I'VE MENTIONED ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION ON THIS FLOOR THAT. WE HAVE A CAUCUS CITIZEN OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZED ON A CALL OF THE LABOR CAUCUS. I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT THE SPOKESPERSON FOR THE LABOR CAUCUS IS ONE WHO CALLED HERSELF LABOR HERSELF. AND I THINK IT'S VERY FORTUNATE WHEN WE ALLOW. UNIONS TO DICTATE. HOW WE ARE GOING TO RUN OUR SCHOOL SYSTEMS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION HAS IMMENSE POWER. AND THEY LIKE TO EXERT THAT POWER. IN ITS WELL OBSERVED ON THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE HERE TODAY. AND THE U. INFLUENCE OF UNIONS WELL DEMONSTRATED IN THE FINAL WEEKS OF THE SESSION TO THE DETRIMENT. OF SO MANY PEOPLE. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IF WE REALLY CARE ABOUT THE QUALITY OF PUBLIC EDUCATION. WE SHOULD LEARN SOMETHING BY THE CHARTER SCHOOLS AND LEARN WHAT THEY'RE DOING RIGHT. AND FIGURE OUT WHAT WE'RE DOING WRONG IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. MAYBE TOO MUCH GERRYMANDERING. BY UNIONS LOOKING OUT FOR THE BEST INTEREST OF TEACHERS AND ENSURING THAT THERE'S TENURE FOR TEACHERS THAT DON'T DESERVE TO BE TEACHING BECAUSE OUR LOUSY TEACHERS. NOT TO MENTION THE 90% OF TEACHERS THAT ARE OUT THERE THEY'RE GREAT THEY'RE REALLY WANT TO DO THE JOB MANY OF WHOM ARE REPUBLICANS AND REALLY. WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE UNCONSTRAINED. AND THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO USE OUR TALENTS TO TEACH OUR STUDENTS. THE WAY I RECEIVED A PUBLIC EDUCATION WHEN I WAS GOING TO SCHOOL. THIS AGAIN LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IS NOTHING MORE THAN ATTACK ON CHARTER SCHOOLS. A MAJORITY WHICH HAVE HAD TREMENDOUS SUCCESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FOR THOSE REASONS I URGE A NO VOTE ON AB FIFTY NO FIVE. IF YOU'RE PART OF THE LABOR CAUCUS WILL BE LOOKING FOR YOUR YES VOTE ON AB FIFTY NO FIVE. BETTER NIELSEN. THAT ARE PRESENT LADIES AND GENTLEMAN THE SENATE I'M JUST GOING TO. REFER TO THE. AND I USUALLY READ THE BILLS BUT HERE I DON'T NEED TO GO ANY FURTHER THAN THE ANALYSIS. CERTAINLY VALIDATES THE THINGS I SAID A FEW MINUTES AGO. END OF THE DIVERT DAYS OF CHARTER SCHOOLSARE ADVOCATES THERE FOR OR FOR. WHO SAY THEY BUY INTO THIS. I WOULD OFFER SOME ADVICE. THEY'LL COME AROUND AND TALK TO ME. ELECTED USE HYPOCRITES. IT DON'T COMPLAIN. AND ONE OF THE ACTIONS AROUND HERE IS STILL A MAN AND A BAD DEAL. I CAN ENVISION MEETINGS WITH SOME OF THESE INDIVIDUALS MORE THEY NEGOTIATED TO AMEND THE BILL. SO WHAT WOULD BE ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS. THE RENEWALS IT WOULD BE ALTERED FROM FIVE. YEARS TO SEVEN. NOW THAT MEANS. FIVE IT DOESN'T MEAN FIVE TO SEVEN. THAT IS NOT HOW IT'S GONNA WORK OUT. HERE'S ONE THAT THEY SHOULD BE HUGELY EMBARRASSED IF THEY'VE MADE A DEAL. ELIMINATES ACADEMIC IMPROVEMENT AS THE MOST IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION WHEN REVIEWING A CHARTER SCHOOL. THAT IS NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION. IF THAT IS NOT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WHAT IN THE WORLD IS. IT ALLOWS THE. OR PROHIBITS THE APPROVAL OF A PETITION. FOR A NEW NON CLASSROOM. BASED CHARTER SCHOOL. FROM JANUARY. TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWO TO TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO END QUOTE MOST CIRCUMSTANCE. SO NOW WE'RE GONNA PUT A CAP THE STOCK. BASED ON WHAT EVIDENCE NOW THAT MAY HAVE COME UP IN COMMITTEE I WOULD HOPE THAT SOMEONE. IN THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE HAD ASKED THE QUESTION. WHAT DOES THIS DO WHAT DOES IT ACCOMPLISH. I'D LIKE TO KNOW. THAT I LIKE SOME OF THOSE CHARTER FOLKS WHO BOUGHT INTO THIS DEAL COMING EXPLAINED TO ME. WHAT THIS DOES. NO. THIS IS ANOTHER SLIPPERY SLOPE NOW THIS IS JUMPING OVER THE CLIFF. I CLOSE WITH ELIMINATES ACADEMIC IMPROVEMENT AS THE MOST IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION WHEN REVIEWING A CHARTER SCHOOL. NEED I OR ANYONE SAY MORE. CENTER SKINNER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I STAND IN SUPPORT OF AB FIFTEEN OH FIVE. I'M THERE WAS A INDEPENDENT STUDY COMMISSION TO EXAMINE THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE GROWTH OF CHARTER SCHOOLS IN MY LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICT OAKLAND UNIFIED. THAT STUDY SHOWED THAT OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS APPROXIMATELY TWENTY NINE POINT TWO MILLION. IN REVENUE THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE GONE TO UST. WAS DIVERTED DUE TO THE GROWTH OF CHARTER SCHOOLS NO OAKLAND UST HAS FORTY FIVE CHARTER SCHOOLS THE HIGHEST PROPORTION OF ANY LARGE SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE STATE. A SIMILAR FINANCIAL IMPACT WAS ALSO IDENTIFIED ON MY SECOND LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICT WEST CONTRA COSTA UNIFIED. BOTH OF THESE SCHOOL DISTRICTS GET A VERY SIGNIFICANT FUNDING FOR OUR AREA DOES OF THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA BECAUSE OF OUR HIGH PERCENT OF CHILDREN ON FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH CHILDREN WITH ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE AND A VARIETY OF OTHER CRITERIA THAT MAKES ONE ELIGIBLE FOR THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. NOW INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH. BOTH OAKLAND UNIFIED IN WEST CONTRA COSTA HAVE BEEN STRUCTURING STRUGGLING SIGNAL. WITH THE GREAT FINANCIAL BURDEN. NOW THEIR COSTS ARE HIGHER WHY. BECAUSE OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS OR NON CHARTER SCHOOLS AND I REALIZE OUR CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE ALSO PUBLIC BUT ARE NON CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO HAVE CREDENTIALED TEACHERS WERE ES. MY SCHOOLS IN OAKLAND UNIFIED IN WEST CONTRA COSTA THEY MUST HAVE CREDENTIALED TEACHERS SO. THAT MAY BE ONE OF THE REASONS WHY. I'VE YET TO FIND A STUDY THAT DEMONSTRATES THAT CHARTER SCHOOLS PROVIDE A DOCUMENTED BETTER EDUCATION THAN TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS. I THINK THIS BILL IS NECESSARY I'M GLAD THERE WAS NEGOTIATIONS THAT CAME TO A PLACE WHERE MORE PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO GET IN SUPPORT. BUT I THINK THAT OUR CHILDREN DESERVE TO HAVE CREDENTIALED TEACHERS AND- OUR TWO SCHOOLS SYSTEMS THAT ARE SUPPORTED BY OUR PUBLIC FUNDS DESERTED ME HVE TO MEET THE SAME STANDARDS AND WITH THAT I ASKED FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. SENATOR STERN. THANK YOU MEMBERS AND I'LL BE BRIEF I JUST WANT TO THANK. THE AUTHOR AND ESPECIALLY THE GOVERNOR FOR. STEPPING IN AND PLAYING A CRITICAL ROLE IN. CRAFTING A FRAMEWORK THAT I THINK IS HISTORIC. NOTE POLITICAL RHETORIC ASIDE. I AM PROUD TO STAND WITH TEACHERS ANY DAY OF THE WEEK. BUT THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT BEING ANTI CHARTER PRO CHARTER PRO UNION OR ANTI UNION. THIS IS A FRAMEWORK THAT SAYS IF YOU'RE A HIGH QUALITY WELL PERFORMING SCHOOL. AND YOU OF YOUR KIDS IN THAT SCHOOL WHEN YOU'RE A PARENT THERE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME CERTAINTY THAT SCHOOL WILL CONTINUE TO GET TO DO ITS WORK. WE HAVE IN MY DISTRICT LAUSD WHICH IS SIMILARLY SITUATED. DISTRICT IN TERMS OF THE FINANCIAL BURDENS TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM BERKELEY. WE HAVE AN INCREDIBLY HIGH INCIDENCE OF PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOLS. THAT ARE WITHIN LAUSD THAT ARE RUN BY. TEACHERS WHO ARE UNION. BUT WHOSE PARENTS WERE UNCERTAIN AND ANXIOUS WHEN THE FIRST VERSION IS BILL CAME FORWARD AS TO WHAT. KIND OF HOOPS THEY WOULD HAVE TO JUMP FRUIT THROUGH TO MAKE SURE THEIR KIDS CAN KEEP GOING TO SCHOOL GET THAT QUALITY EDUCATION WE TALK ABOUT. I THINK THIS IS A DURABLE AND HISTORIC FRAMEWORK THAT WE CAN BUILD ON AND SOME DAY. MAYBE BREAK THIS IMPASSE WE CAN GET THE POLITICS OUT OF OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM AND JUST START EMPOWERING TEACHERS AND STUDENTS TO DO WHAT THEY DO BEST WHICH IS TEACHING LEARNED SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. SENATOR GROWTH. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE IN OPPOSITION OF AB FIFTEEN OH FIVE YOU KNOW CHARTER SCHOOLS AND THEIR FAMILIES HAVE A VERY VITAL ROLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR ABOUT SIX HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND A STUDENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT IT TEN CHARTER SCHOOLS AND AB FIFTEEN OH FIVE GIVE PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICT MORE AUTHORITY SO IT'S COMPARABLE TO ST WALMART AND YOU WILL APPROVE IF TARGET CAN COME IN AND BE NEXT TO YOU TO COMPETE. AND WALMART CAN SAY THAT INTERFERES WITH MY ABILITY TO MAKE MONEY AND SO THAT'S KIND OF THE SAME THING SO PUBLIC SCHOOLS WILL BE ABLE TO SAY NO CHARTER SCHOOLS CAN'T COME IN BECAUSE IT AFFECTS MY ABILITY TO RETAIN MONEY MY COLLEAGUE FROM BERKELEY AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM THOUSAND OAKS AVENTURA YOU MADE THE COMMEN ABOUT. MORE CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE GETTING MORE STUDENTS AWAY FROM PUBLIC SCHOOLS WHICH IS CREATING A FINANCIAL IMPACT WELL IF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS WERE DOING AND SRVING THOSE STUDENTS BETTER THAN THE CHARTER SCHOOLS WHICH IS COMPETITION THEN THOSE PARENTS WOULDN'T CHOOSE TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO THOSE CHARTER SCHOOLS SO I ASK YOU TO THINK ABOUT THAT WE HAVE TWO CHARTER SCHOOL MAIN CHARTER SCHOOLS IN OUR DISTRICT WE HAVE GRAHAM WAY COUNTY ME AND WE HAVE PARAMOUNT BARRED. THE MAINLY SERVICE SHAFTER ARVIN LAMONT AND WASCO WHICH IS A MAJORITY MINORITY DISTRICT AND FARMING COMMUNITIES THOSE SCHOOLS HAVE BOTH BEEN LABEL DISTINGUISH MOST DISTINGUISHED SCHOOLS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THOSE STUDENTS THAT WERE FAILING IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM IN THE TRADITIONAL SCHOOLS HAVE NOW BEEN EXCELLING IN THOSE SCHOOLS AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY GOING ON TO COLLEGE BECAUSE THE STUDENTS HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO ATTEND A CHARTERSCHOOL THEY'VE WITH CHANGING THEIR SCHEDULE FOR INSTANCE LIKE FROM KINDERGARTEN OR FIRST GRADE THROUGH EIGHTH GRADE DATE CHANGE EVERY FIFTEEN DID EVERY TWENTY MINUTES VERSES EVERY HOUR AND A HALF. THE KIDS. MORE OF AN ATTENTION SPAN TEACHERS TEACH ON SUBJECT MATTER ONLY SO THERE THE EXPERT IN THAT SUBJECT MATTER WHICH GETS THE KIDS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO LEARN THAT SUBJECT MATTER BETTER. AND WITH THE HIGHER QUALITY OF EDUCATION THEY HAVE A LEARNING LAB WHERE THE STUDENTS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SELECT AND TOUR COLLEGES AT EIGHTH GRADE IN EVEN A FRESHMAN IN HIGH SCHOOL. AND MORE STUDENTS THAT ATTEND THESE CHARTER SCHOOLS GO OFF TO COLLEGE THAN IN THE TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOL SETTING. YOU HAVE STUDENTS THAT HAVE BEEN DELINQUENT OR STUDENTS THAT HAVE NOT PARTICIPATED OR NOT I'M GOING TO THE TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS BUT WHEN YOU PUT A MINUTE. CHARTER SCHOOL SETTING THEY TEND TO EXCEL AND ATTEND CLASSES SO THE CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE VITALLY IMPORTANT AND ALLOW OUR STUDENTS TO BE GAINFULLY. BE MORE ENGAGED IN SCHOOL AND TO SAY THAT THEY HAVE TO GET APPROVAL FROM AN ORDER MISSION SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT IS OPPOSED TO. OR BASED ON A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE FOR A FINANCIAL BURDEN. IT'S JUST SIMPLE TO SAY JUST LIKE I SAID WITH WALMART TARGET WALMART CAN SAY TARGET NO YOU'RE GONNA AFFECT MY FINANCES SO THEREFORE YOU CAN'T COME IN. THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND SAY YOU'RE GONNA AFFECT MY FINANCES SO THEY'RE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS CAN BE RENEWED. I JUST ASK YOU TO VOTE NO AND THINK ABOUT THE STUDENTS THAT ARE AFFECTED BY THIS BILL. SENATOR ALLEN. WELL IT'S TRUE THAT IS A SCHOOL DISTRICT CAN MAKE A DECISION BASED ON FINANCES TO SOME EXTENT BUT YET REMEMBER THAT'S WHY THE APPROVED AND KEPT THE APPEAL RIGHT NOW IS ONE OF THE ISSUES I KNOW THAT WAS IT WAS A REAL PROBLEM FOR THE C. CSA WHEN THE BILL WAS OVER ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE BUT THE FACT IS IF THERE IS AN OVERLY POLITICIZED DECISION MADE AT THE SCHOOL BOARD LEVEL THEY CAN BE APPEALED. TO THE COUNTY AND THE COUNTY WOULD HAS ABSOLUTE DO NOVO REVIEW WHICH MEANS THAT THEY CAN LOOK AT THE AT THE APPLICATION WITHOUT REGARD FOR ANY FINDING MADE BY THE LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD AND THEN BY THE WAY IF THERE'S ANY ABUSE OF DISCRETION IN EITHER OF THE LOCAL OR THE COUNTY LEVELS THERE'S ALSO APPEAL RIGHTS AT THE STATE LEVEL SO THOSE ARE ALL AND REALLY IMPORTANT I THINK YOU WOULD YOU CREATE THESE BOARDS OF DIFFERENT EDUCATION POLICYMAKERS. AND WE TRUST THEM WITH THE DISCRETION TO MAKE DECISIONS A THINKER IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE STUDENTS IN THAT THEIR COMMUNITY SO I HAVE TO SAY I'M I THINK THIS IS A STORE COMPROMISE THIS IS A BATTLE IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS AND YEARS ANYBODY WHO'S BEEN AROUND HERE KNOWS THAT THAT WAS ABOUT IT WAS NOT GOING TO GO AWAY UNTIL THERE WAS SOME FORM OF A DEAL STRUCK AND I ACTUALLY THINK THAT THEY STRUCK. THE RIGHT BALANCE AND I WILL SAY TO MY FRIENDS WERE CONCERNED. CHARTER SCHOOLS FIGHT IT THIS THIS THIS DEAL DOES A FIRM THAT IF YOU ARE. AN EXISTING HIGH QUALITY CHARTER SCHOOL THAT IS YOU KNOW THAT IS PLAYING BY THE RULES YOU ARE HERE TO STAY. THAT WAS UP FOR QUESTION BEFORE IT ALSO SAYS THAT IT FOR EXISTING AND NEW CHARTER SCHOOLS A LIKE A DIFFERENCE OF CHARTERS ACTUALLY HAVE A REALLY IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY. IN CLOSING ARGUMENT GAPS SO I THINK DID YOU. DO DID YOU CAN NOW THERE'S A BIG DEAL AND THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS IN THERE WE CAN WE CAN WE CAN PARSE APART. BUT I THINK WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO THREAD A VERY DIFFICULT DEAL HERE WITH THE STEEL AND I COMMEND THE FOLKS. WHO WERE INVOLVED IN IN WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE STRUCK A BALANCE BETWEEN PROVIDING IMPORTANT AMOUNT OF DISCRETION TO THE FOLKS THAT WE ENTRUST. WITH RUNNING OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM BOTH OF THE LOCAL AND COUNTY LEVELS WERE ALSO CUT COUNTING FOR THE FACT. THAT SOMETIMES DECISIONS TO GET OVERLY POLITICIZED AND I'M AND IN ALLOWING AS A RESULT FOR AND PRESERVING. THOSE APPEAL RIGHTS. AND WITH THAT I'LL BE VOTING AYE. SENATOR BURGESS. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. THIS IS A HOT BUTTON TOPIC IN MY HOUSEHOLD. MY MOTHER WAS A LONG TERM FACULTY MEMBER IN PUBLIC IN AT A PUBLIC INSTITUTION. AND I REMEMBER CHATTING WITH HER ABOUT THE MERITS OF CHARTER SCHOOLS VERSUS TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS. AND. SHE BROUGHT UP SOME VERY IMPRESSIVE POINTS. AND I DID MY BEST TO BRING OUT WHAT I BILL LAW WHAT WHAT I BELIEVED WERE IMPRESSIVE POINTS AS WELL. AND THEN I CAN'T CAME UPON THIS ISSUE OF. WHAT IF THE ROLES WERE REVERSED. WHAT IF PUBLIC SCHOOLS TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS. NEEDED TO GO THROUGH AUTHORIZATION. THE WAY. THAT WE IMPOSED UPON CHARTER SCHOOLS. WELL SHOULD INDIVIDUALS WOULD CERTAINLY OBJECT TO THAT. AND WHAT HAPPENS IF WE HAD A FIVE YEAR PROVE UP PERIOD. IF WE HAD A FIVE YEAR PROVE UP PERIOD FOR THAT INSTITUTION TO DEMONSTRATE ITS ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE. BUT WAIT LET'S MAKE IT TWO TO SEVEN. HOW WOULD A PUBLIC INSTITUTION TO RESPOND TO THAT. PROBABLY NOT FAVORABLY HOW ABOUT A PUBLIC INSTITUTION THAT WOULD BE FORCED TO CLOSE IF IT WAS NOT PERFORMING ADEQUATELY WITH THAT HAPPENED IN FRESNO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN MY NECK OF THE WOODS WHICH IS ONE THE LARGEST IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN THE ANSWER WOULD BE NO. THEY WOULD NOT CLOSE DOWN. SO THIS IDEA THAT. THERE'S A LEVEL PLAYING FEAR FIELD BY SOME OF THE FOLKS THAT HAVE COMMENTED EARLIER AND ONE OF THEM FROM MORE MY ONE OF MY FRIENDS FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IS THAT IF YOU WERE HIGH PERFORMING YOU ARE HERE TO STAY. WOMAN TO THROW THAT RIGHT BACK. IF YOU'RE A PUBLIC INSTITUTION IN YOUR HIGH PERFORMING YOU ARE HERE TO STAY. A CHARTER SCHOOL WOULD NOT BE NEEDED IF THE SCHOOLS WERE HIGH PERFORMING IN HERE TO STAY BUT THAT'S JUST ME THAT THAT IS JUST NOT THE CASE. AND SO I KNOW THAT THIS IS THE SECOND TIME OR MORE THAN WE'VE TALKED ABOUT CHARTER SCHOOLS AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR FUTURE. BUT I HAVE TWO LITTLE BOYS WERE EIGHT AND SIX IN THIS IS KITCHEN. OUR DINING TABLE DISCUSSION THAT I HAVE WITH MY WIFE ALL THE TIME. SHE DOESN'T NECESSARILY CARE NOR DO Y. NOR DO MY CHILDREN ABOUT FACULTY TENURE. THEY DON'T NECESSARILY CARE ABOUT THESE OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT WE CARE ABOUT. ALL OF THE EDUCATION THAT WILL ALLOW THEM UPWARD MOBILITY IN A LFESTYLE THAT WE'VE TAKEN FOR GRANTED HILL. WE ARE NOT BETTER OFF THAN OUR PARENTS IS CERTAINLY NOT BETTER OFF THAN OUR GRANDPARENTS. BUT I LOSE PATIENCE WITH THIS IDEA THAT. THAT THIS IS LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD. THIS ISN'T LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD. THIS IS FORCIBLY GETTING ONE PARTY TO CRY UNCLE. SO WHEN WE CALL THIS A COMPROMISE PIECE OF LEGISLATION IT MEANS ONE PARTY SIMPLY DOESN'T HAVE THE POLITICAL MUSCLE TO GO UP AGAINST OTHERS AND THEY ARE CRYING UNCLE IN WILL RESORT TO COMPROMISE TO STATE IN EXISTENCE. AND I KNOW THAT WE MAY HAVE PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENT DISAGREEMENTS ON ON THIS ISSUE. BUT IF I GO BACK IN FLIP THE FLIP THE TABLE ON THIS IN OPPOSED TO SAME REQUIREMENTS ON TRADITIONAL PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS THAT WE HAVE ON CHARTER SCHOOLS. THIS WOULD NOT EXIST AS A DEBATE TODAY. IT WOULD NOT AT ALL AND I WOULD ASK MY COLLEAGUES. IF THIS IS TRULY ABOUT EDUCATING OUR CHILDREN. THEN LET THE MERITS OF THIS INDUSTRY SIX FEET. OR FAIL ON ON ITS OWN WEIGHT. THAT IS THE BEAUTY OF CHARTER SCHOOLS THE RIGHTS OR FEEL ON THEIR OWN MERITS BUT WE DON'T WANT TO GIVE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOSE INSTITUTIONS TO RISE IN THAT IS WHERE I HAVE PROBLEMS AS A FATHER. AS A PARENT AS A HUSBAND IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT. I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK MY COLLEAGUES TO RECOGNIZE THIS FOR WHAT IT IS. IN VOTE THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION DOWN. SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU WELL FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD TO IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE TALK ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND AS AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS I DO RISE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL THERE ARE MANY REASONS TO DO SO BUT TO IN PARTICULAR STAND OUT WELL FIRST IT MAKES A SIGNIFICANT STEPS TOWARDS HELPING THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICTS WALLET KNOWLEDGE GENE THAT WE DO NEED. HIGH QUALITY CHARTER SCHOOLS AS PART OF THE EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR STUDENTS SECONDLY AND MORE IMPORTANTLY. BY SETTLING THIS DISCUSSION I HOPE THAT WE CAN NOW MOVED AND TACKLE THE BIGGER ISSUES FACING OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. EDUCATION IS ONE OF MY TOP PRIORITIES AND I FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THIS I DON'T WANT US TO HAVE US FALL SENSE THAT THIS IS A FIX AND THIS IS GOING TO SOLVE OUR ISSUES IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL. SECTOR. I WOULD LIKE US TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A DISCUSSION. ASKED TO IMPACTS DIRECTLY IN OUR CLASSROOMS FOR EXAMPLE WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT CLASS SIZE REDUCTION. WE NEED TO BREAK BACK HARD MUSIC PROGRAMS IN OUR SCHOOLS WHICH AND RE IN RICH AND BOOST THE LEARNING EXPERIENCES OF OUR STUDENTS STUDENTS LEARN DIFFERENTLY AND MANY NEED TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES NOT JUST ACADEMICALLY. WE NEED TO PROPERTY EQUIP OUR CLASSROOMS WITH TECHNOLOGY AND ENSURE THAT EACH AND EVERY STUDENT HOUSE THE TECHNOLOGY THEY NEED TO SUCCEED WHICH WE CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE. WE NEED TO PROPERLY FUND NURSES IN OUR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL MIDDLE SCHOOLS AND HIGH SCHOOLS. PHIL TEACHERS DON'T HAVE TO PLAY NURSE DURING TEACHING TIME WE NEED TO ENGAGE IN VIGOROUS DISCUSSIONS ON UPDATING ANTIQUATED TEACHING PREPARATION PROGRAMS ND TASKS FOR STUDENTS AND ART TEACHERS. AS WELL AS MANY OTHER ISSUES THAT ARE SO EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT OUR TEACHERS OUR STUDENTS AND OUR STAFFS I LOOK FORWARD TO THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE ALL OF YOU ON ALL THESE CRITICAL ISSUES THAT WILL HELP OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS BECOME BETTER AND WITH THAT I ALSO RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IDOL THANK YOU. SENATOR MOORLACH. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT WE ARE HAVING A DEBATE ON PUBLIC SCHOOL SO THANK YOU VERYMUCH I WANT TO DISCLOSE THAT MY ONE OF MY BROTHERS IS A SCHOOL TEACHER WITH ANAHEIM UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT AND MY OTHER BROTHER I HAVE TWO BROTHERS HIS WIFE WAS A TEACHER AT SANTA ANA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE. ONE DISCLOSE THAT. SO SCHOOLS ARE IMPORTANT TO ME AND SO WHEN WE GRABBED ALL THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY SCHOOL DISTRICTS LAST YEAR WHICH WAS NOT AN EASY JOB COLLEAGUES TO GET ALL THAT DATA BECAUSE THERE'S NO. REPOSITORY FOR THOSE REPORTS. BUT WHEN WE WERE DONE WITH THE- LOOKING AT THE FINANCIAL REPORTS THE AUDITS AS OF JUNE THIRTY. TWENTY SEVENTEEN I LITERALLY GOT DEPRESSED AT HOW. SOBERING THE NUMBERS WERE SO YOU TAKE ASSETS LESS LIABILITIES EQUALS THE NET ASSETS ARE OWNERS EQUITY OR WHATEVER RETAIN EARNINGS WHATEVER TERM YOU WANT TO USE FROM YOUR ACCOUNTING CLASSES. AND THEN YOU YOU TAKE THAT NET ASSET IN YOUR REDUCE IT BY A MONEY. I'M OUT THAT THAT IS YOURS THAT SHOWS THAT YOU HAVE SOME NETWORK SOME pNUMBERS ARE STAGGERING WHEN WE ADDED ALL NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY. THE NUMBER FOR THE NET UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICIT. WAS FIFTY POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS. WE DID IT AGAIN THIS YEAR ADD IT ALL UP FOR THE- SCHOOL DISTRICTS ALL NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY. AND THE NUMBER WAS SEVENTY POINT EIGHT BILLION IT WENT UP TWENTY POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS ONLY NINETY FIVE SCHOOLS ARE HAVE A NET UNRESTRICTED. ASSETS OF ZERO OR HIGHER JUST 10% SO I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A DISCUSSION ON PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN OUR PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS AND WE'RE STILL YOU KNOW DATA DIVING. BUT WE AREN'T WE'RE NOT SEEING AN INDICATION THAT CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE THE FISCAL PROBLEM. NOT EVEN CLOSE. SO I WOULD LOVE TO GET THE REPORTS AND STUDIES FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM BERKELEY THAT WOULD HELP BECAUSE WE'RE WE'RE COMING UP WITH A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION SO FAR. BUT SEVENTY POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. WOULD YOU MAKE AN INDEPENDENT OBSERVER CONCLUDE THAT PERHAPS OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE MISMANAGED OR SOMETHING IS WRONG WE GOT TO LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS SUCH A PERSON BUT ALSO SEE CHARTER SCHOOLS PERHAPS AS DELIVERING A MUCH BETTER PRODUCT. BUT HOUSTON WE HAVE A BIG BIG PROBLEM. BUT IT HAS BEEN MISDIAGNOSED. AND AB FIFTY NO FIVE IS THE ABSOLUTE WRONG YOUR- I THINK THE ANALOGY USED EARLIER THIS EVENING ABOUT A SHINY OBJECT THIS IS ANY OBJECTS SYNDROME IS REALLY SPOT ON FROM THE SENATOR FOR MARANDA BUT I WOULD CHALLENGE OUR EDUCATION COMMITTEE CHAIR. I WOULD CHALLENGE THE BUDGET AND FISCAL REVIEWS SUB ONE CHAIR THE YOU HAVE BIG JOBS YOU HAVE BIG JOBS YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON HAVE TO WORK WITH MIKE FINE FROM MATT DID THESE ALREADY COME INTO SACRAMENTO CITY. IN A COUPLE WEEKS WE HAVE A BIG JOB SO COLLEAGUES THIS BREAK REST UP WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO FIX OUR SCHOOLS DO YOURSELF ONE FAVOR. VOTE NO. ON A. B. FIFTEEN OH FIVE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SEEING NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE MIKE UP SENATOR LEYVA YOU MAY CONCLUDE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AS A PROUD CHAIR OF SENATE EDUCATION AND AS THE PROUD CHAIR OF THE FICTITIOUS LABOR CAUCUS. I HAVE A FEW THINGS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS. MANY PEOPLE WHO SPOKE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL ACTUALLY HAVE NO IDEA HOW MANY HOURS WITH INTO CRAFTING THIS DEAL. THAT ALL SIDES MET ALL SIDES WERE HEARD. MANY PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT COMPROMISE IS NOT CAPITULATION. WE TALK A LOT ABOUT DYSFUNCTION BETWEEN PARTIES AND WE SAY WHY DON'T PEOPLE WORK TOGETHER AND COMPROMISE THIS DEAL IS A PRODUCT OF COMPROMISE THE EASIEST THING TO DO IN THE WORLD IS TO PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS. THIS BILL DOES NOT PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS THIS BILL DOES WHAT TRUE NEGOTIATORS TO. EVERYONE IS WALKING AWAY A LITTLE BIT HAPPY. AND A LITTLE BIT UNHAPPY.
