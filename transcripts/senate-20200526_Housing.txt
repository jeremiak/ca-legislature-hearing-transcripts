NOW FOCUSING ON HOUSING PRODUCTION ASSIST IN CAL CALIFORNIA IS COVERED NINETEEN RECOVERY IN TWO WAYS.

NOW I CAN BEND A GOVERNOR FOR INVESTING TO SERVE THE IMMEDIATE NEEDS OF THOSE FAKE FACING HOMELESSNESS BUT THESE INVESTMENTS FAILED TO ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSE OF OUR HOMELESSNESS PROBLEM. WHICH IS THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS. LEADING TO THE HOUSING COMMITTEE DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT HOUSING PRODUCTION PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA ARE ALMOST ENTIRELY FUNDED WITH BOND REVENUE.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ARM I HAVE A QUESTION REGARDING THE STRUCTURE OF THE PROGRAM- THE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE PER MILLION THAT GOES FOR FIVE YEARS TO GO BE IS TO CLIMB IT- ADAPTATION WORK ON SEA LEVEL RISE. FLOOD PROTECTION WILDFIRES AND THE LIKE OVER THE LAST. FOR FIVE YEARS OUR CLIMATE ADAPTATION PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN GOING TO THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH FOR THE UMBRELLA GROUP WITH THE GOVERNOR THAT THEY AND DISTRICT WHICH HOUSES THE SEARCH FEATURE GROWTH COUNCIL WHICH HAS BEEN DOING THE PLANNING WORK. THAT WERE YOU KNOW. PROMOTING STRONG NEIGHBORHOODS CONVERTING VACANT LAND SO WHY ARE WE MOVING. THE MONEY INTO GO BE AS RATHER THAN FULL PR WHICH HAS BEEN DOING THIS WORK AND SORT OF HAS AN IDEA OF WHERE TH PLANET. THE PLANNING PROCESS IS IN ALL THESE DIFFERENT. JURISDICTIONS THAT'S MY QUESTION. OKAY I SENATOR BILL WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND. OF ALL CONSIDER ANY- DEPARTMENT THAT'S INTERESTED IN THIS PROGRAM BUT- ESSENTIALLY GO BILL IS AN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT- DEPARTMENT- THAT IS SITUATED TO- PROVIDE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT- GRANTS AND MATCHING FUNDS TO- FUN- THOSE KINDS OF PROGRAMS. THAT STIMULATE- CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION AND THERE'S WHEN YOU SAY CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION THERE'S A WIDE. VARIETY OF TYPES OF FUN SO THAT'S THE REASON THEY CERTAINLY WILL WORK WITH- THE OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH AND- CONDUCTING- THAT PROGRAM I GAVE BECAUSE THE POINT MISTER CHAIRS AT ALL THE AGENCIES IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA'S SUPPOSED TO BE WORKING ON CLIMATE CHANGE IN CLIMATE ADAPTATION CALTRANS- PART OF HOUSING HEALTH HUMAN SERVICES HE ADDED THAT IT DOT AT THE HARMONIZING ELEMENT IS FULL PR WHICH HAS THAT OVERSIGHT OVER ALL OF THEM SO WHAT. I'M CONCERNED WITH IS THAT YOU JUST GET A PATCH OF MONEY TO GO BE AS THEY MADE IN THEIR BASS MINE MAY WANT TO PROMOTE STRONG NEIGHBORHOODS BUT THEY HAVEN'T DONE THE PLANNING THAT OPR AND SHE'S FECAL GROWTH COUNCIL HAS SORT OF SAID THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK BETTER NOT THAT'S NOT IT MAY BE MORE HOUSES YOU PUTTING FLOODPLAIN THAT'S THAT'S MY POINT- THE OTHER. QUESTION I HAVE IS YOU KNOW IT'S ISSUES IT'S TWO BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR WE'RE CUTTING SOMETHING MY CONCERN IS THESE ARE EXISTING PROGRAMS WITH THE NEW PER WITH NEW CHARACTERS IN I'VE DONE SOME WORK IN THE EIGHTY YOU ARE. AREA THERE'S NO SPECIFIC PROGRAM THAT MIGHT HELP OUT SMALL HOMEOWNERS THAT WOULD LIKE TO BUILD THE UNIT IN THERE IN THEIR BACK YARD OR WITH THE CARE. GIVER ANY ANY MAN BUT OF IT SO BUT I THINK THAT THE WHERE THE IF THE GOAL HERE IS TO RELATE CHEN AND YOU. WOULD LIKE INCLUDE EVERYBODY EVEN THE NEW PRODUCTS THAT AND THE COURTS I HOPE THE. THIRTY LOOK AT. NO GRAHAM GIVE BEEN SET FOR PEOPLE TO THANKS FOR DELYLAH UNITS VERY CAL IS ONE OF THE PER HIS SOME WORK TRYING TO WORD OUT TO HELP PEOPLE THEIR THE OF IT AND THAT'S- AN AREA. AGAIN THE OTHER THING THE OTHER CONCERN THAT I HAVE AND A GOOD JUST GO TO COPE IS BUT I'M VERY CONCERNED WITH THE WEALTHY. INTERFACE AND NO. PROTECTIONS OR LIMITATIONS ON CONSTRUCTION IN THOSE AREAS YES WE- AS WE CONTINUE CONTINUE TO BATTLE THE PANDEMIC AND CLIMATE CHANGE SO THERE'S A- THERE'S- WHILE PEOPLE MAY WANT TO MONEY FOR ECONOMIC STIMULUS IT MAYBE BUILDING HOUSES IN THE EXACT AREAS WE DON'T WANT THEM TO BE. BUILT AND WE HAVE DONE THAT THAT WORK AND AT THAT CHALLENGE SO- I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER ACCOUNTS THE NEXT CENTER MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR VERY GRATEFUL I JUST WANTED TO TAKE A QUICK MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU TO SENATOR BELL. CENTRE BELL HAS BEEN WORKING ON ALL ISSUES OF HOUSING HIS ENTIRE CAREER IN THE LEGISLATURE. SB SEVEN NINETY FIVE IS CRITICAL CRITICAL TO BE ABLE TO SOLVE OUR CRISIS IN THIS IS BE CANDID AT THE CRISIS IS MORE CUTE THAN EVER BEFORE THE REASON I SAY THAT IS WHAT THIS VIRUS IS DONE IS SHOWN THE DISPARITY IN OUR ECONOMY. DISPARITY IN OUR HOUSING MARKET FOR THOSE HAVE IN THOSE WHO HAVE NOT I KNOW THAT HE'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS BILL CONTINUE TO WORK DETAILS OUT WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS. AND IT'S ONE TECHNO MISTER CHAIR AGAIN IS A THANK YOU TO THE GOOD SENATOR FROM SAN JOSE FOR HIS TENACIOUS WORK. THANK YOU CENTER MCGUIRE AYE NEXT WITH A CENTER MORE LOCK. THANK YOU MISTER OF CENTRE BELL OF LAST YEAR YOU DID A SIMILAR BILL IT WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR I JUST WAS CURIOUS IF YOU COULD COMMENT. ON WHAT'S DIFFERENT THIS YEAR. I WOULD SAY WHAT'S DIFFERENT THIS YEAR AS WE HAVE OF A EVEN MORE EXTREME CRISIS. WITH PROVIDING HOUSING. DUE TO THE VIRUS DUE TO. THE ECONOMICS IN CALIFORNIA THE UNEMPLOYMENT CALIFORNIA AND TO DO NOTHING. JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. TO DO NOTHING MEANS THAT WE'LL HAVE MORE HOMELESS MORE GOVERNMENT COST. MORE TRAGEDIES IN FAMILIES TO DO NOTHING MEANS THAT. THE PROBLEMS THAT PEOPLE HAVE. WITH THEIR HOUSING. WILL BE IGNORED BY THE LEGISLATURE. SO I THINK THE SENATE HAS ALWAYS BEEN STRONGLY SUPPORT OF. PROGRAMS TO DEVELOP A PACKAGE OF BILLS. OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HOUSING PRODUCTION AND WE HAVE A HOUSING PRODUCTION BILL- HERE THAT WILL PRODUCE CONSTRUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING YOU'LL PROVIDE ECONOMIC STIMULUS. AND MORE THAN ANY OTHER TIME WE NEED TO CREATE THESE JOBS. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT NOW'S THE TIME TO DO IT MORE THAN EVER. SO IT WAS VETOED IN AN ERA OF SURPLUS. AND NOW WE'RE IN AN ERA OF A DEFICIT I'M I'M JUST CURIOUS DO YOU HAVE. ANY INSIGHTS AS TO WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S THINKING ABOUT THIS PROGRAM WELL I WOULD READ THE DETAILED MESSAGE WHICH STATES THAT- IN IN. TERMS OF- PREVIOUS VETOES HE EXCLAIMED THAT. WE SHOULD CONSIDER THIS BOTH IN TERMS OF POLICY BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF THE BUDGET THAT'S WITH THE GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE SAID IF YOU READ IT THAT'S THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE SAID. SO WE ARE DOING NOW ALL RIGHT THAT IS JUST SOMETHING TO CONSIDER BOTH AS A POLICY ISSUE WHICH WE ARE TODAY. BUT ALSO. WHEN IT COMES TIME TO. DEVELOPING ANY KIND OF CREATIVE FINANCING. WE SHOULD NOT GIVE UP WE SHOULD CONTINUE. WE SHOULD TRY TO HELP PEOPLE. THAT ARE SUFFERING. THERE'S MORE MORE HOMELESS. THERE'S MORE AND MORE NEED- THE GOVERNOR IS- SHIFTING HIS POSITION FROM WHERE HE WAS LAST YEAR. AND SO SHOULD WE- THANK YOU CENTER BELT THANK YOU MISTER. CENTER TO ROSS SO. UP THANK YOU I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I TO WANT TO A SKEWS ME APPLIED SENATOR BELL OF FOR PUSHING FOR A LONG TERM FUNDING STRATEGY- VERSES THE JUST ONE OFF. THIS MUCH MONEY THIS YEAR YOU REALLY CAN'T DEPEND ON JUST. ONE AT A TIME WHEN YOU'RE AT A TIME I ESPECIALLY. APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE PRIORITIZING MULTI FAMILY HOUSING AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND FARM WORKER HOUSING AND I BELIEVE AS THE LEGISLATURE THAT WE SHOULD BE COMMITTED. TO PROTECTING AND CREATING HOUSING FOR THE COMMUNITIES WITH THE MOST NEEDS ADD UP YOUR BILL DOES JUST THAT I ALSO ONE APPLAUD YOU FOR THE COMPREHENSIVE WAY IN WHICH ALL OF THESE PIECES ARE PULLED TOGETHER- BUSINESS SEES AS AS AS AN OPPORTUNITY. OF WORKERS SEE THIS THAT THEY'LL BE PAID OF DECENT GOOD WAGES- SO I AGAIN I APPLAUD YOU FOR THE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH OF THAT YOU'VE TAKEN WITH THIS- I JUST HAVE ONE. OF THE ISSUE WHICH I MENTIONED TO YOU WHICH IS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY. I AND PRE APPRENTICES PRE APPRENTICESHIPS I DO BELIEVE THAT A THIS TIME WHAT NEEDS TO MATCH THE URGENCY AND THE BIGGER SCALE THAT WERE THINKING ABOUT THAT YOU'VE PROPOSED HERE THAT WE HAVE TO BE MUCH MUCH MORE ASSERTIVE. ABOUT THE NUMBER OF MEN AND WOMEN WHO CAN GET THROUGH- THE APPRENTICESHIP PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS AND BE A PART OF THAT SKILLED WORK FORCE OF AND GOOD WAGES SO I WOULD URGE- THE SENATOR TO. INCREASE THE AMOUNT TOWARDS ALL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER LIKE HEALTHCARE I'M SORRY I FORGOT TO QUESTION PICKING UP ON WITH US SENATE TO RISE SO JUST SAID THE- OPPOSITION WHO IS A RELATIVELY IS INTERESTED IN CREATING GOOD JOBS TO IS SAYING THAT THE CURRICULUM THAT THEY USE. IN THEIR PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS IS THE SAME THAT WE USE IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO DOES THAT MEAN THAT IF I GRADUATE COMMUNITY COLLEGE WITH THE- CONSTRUCTION. DEGREE I'M NOT ELIGIBLE FOR FUNDING FOR THE JOE SERRANO PROGRAM OR THE HOUSING TRUST FUND OR ANY OF THESE PROGRAMS AS THE BILL'S WRITTEN RIGHT NOW. IS THAT THE QUESTION MISTER CHAIR TO THE AUTHOR. SENATE BILL OF. I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE CURRICULUM. THAT'S DEVELOPED BY THE WORKFORCE INVESTMENT BOARD THERE THE ONES THAT HAVE THE TECHNICAL SKILLS AND ABILITIES TO DEVELOP- THE CURRICULUM AND WE'RE SIMPLY SAYING. THAT THE ALLOCATION THAT GOES TO THE WORKFORCE INVESTMENT BOARD WILL BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE APPROVED TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT THEY HAVE ADOPTED AS APPROVED PROGRAMS. THESE OTHER PROGRAMS IF THEY WANT TO- CAN. GET THEIR CURRICULUM APPROVED THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO THE WORKFORCE INVESTMENT BOARD AND- THIS IS THE SAME- AS WE HAD AND- SB ONE. I TAKE I TAKE THIS IS THE REASON THAT THIS EVEN IS IN THE BILL IS BECAUSE WE SIR RECOGNIZE THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO INCREASE HOUSING PRODUCTION CONSTRUCTION. WE NEED TO HAVE SKILLED IN TRADE WORKFORCE. AND WE HAVE TO HAVE SKILLED TRAINED WORKFORCE OF INCREASES SO THAT'S WHY. THIS IS ALLOCATION IS IN THIS IN THIS BILL BUT- THE BILL DOES NOT. ADJUST OR CHANGE THE WORKFORCE INVESTMENT BOARDS PROCESS THROUGH. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND THE OTHER AGENCIES IN TERMS OF CURRICULUM FOR- SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE. MR IMAGES IF I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CURRICULUM IS AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE GOT A BUNCH OF THERE WERE TRYING TO PROMOTE THIS IS A TIME WHEN YOUNG PEOPLE ARE GOING BACK TO SCHOOL TO LEARN THE SKILLS AND I WOULD HATE TO SEE THAT THEY GET TO TWO YEARS IN GRADUATE FROM GAVEL HONOR SAN JOSE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. AND SAID- YOU GOT THE WRONG CERTIFICATE YOU'RE NOT IT DOESN'T APPLY TO SB SEVEN NINE FIVE WHICH IS AGAIN I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW THE RIGORS OF THE ALL THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND JUST SPOTTING AN ISSUE THAT THAT MIGHT WANT SOME ATTENTION IF WHICH REALLY TRYING TO- SPREAD THAT BI AND BRAWL AND GET GET STUFF CONSTRUCTED BUT- THANK YOU. THANK YOU- COLORS ARE THERE ANY OTHER MEMBERS WHO HAVE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS REGARDING SB SEVEN NINETY FIVE. OKAY JUST BEFORE I TURN OVER SAID ABOUT A CLOSE I WANT TO THANKS- CENTER BELL FOR HIS EXTRAORDINARY LEADERSHIP ON FUNDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING AS YOU MAY RECALL TWENTY SEVENTEEN. HE AUTHORED- THE BILL THAT FIVE CENT A SIGNIFICANT AFFORDABLE HOUSING BOND TO THE VOTERS WHICH A VOTERS PASSED- AND HE HAS NOW BEEN WORKING TIRELESSLY- TO MAKE SURE THE CALIFORNIA. KEEPS ITS COMMITMENTS- TO CREATE AND THE FUNDS HOUSING FOR PARTICULARLY OUR LOW INCOME. VERY LOW INCOME EXTREMELY LOW INCOME RESIDENTS. NINETEEN AS IT HAS FOR MANY ISSUES HAS SHED. A SPOTLIGHT HAS CAST A SPOTLIGHT ON SOME OF THE UGLIEST ASPECTS OF OUR SOCIETY. AND THE OBSCENE COSTS OF HOUSING. AND THE OBSCENE RATES OF HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA. ARE AMONG THOSE SCARS IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE BEING VIOLATED SADLY BY COVER NINETEEN BUT IT'S ALSO GOOD TO CAST A SPOTLIGHT BECAUSE IT ALLOWS EVERYONE TO SEE WHAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING IN THE STATE. AND IT CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY ADDRESS. THAT PROBLEM WE KNOW WE HAVE A TERRIBLE BUDGET DEFICIT NOW. BUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUNDING MUST BE PART OF THE MIX AS WE GO THROUGH THIS TERRIBLE BUDGET TIMES AND INDEED AS YOU GO INTO A RECESSION. IT MAKES EVEN MORE SENSE TO INCREASE YOUR INVESTMENT IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONSIDERING THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR. DURING A RECESSION AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE KEEPING OUR CONSTRUCTION WORKFORCE EMPLOYED SO WE DON'T HAVE A REPEAT. OF TWO THOUSAND SEVEN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. WHERE THE HELL THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. BASICALLY THE SALT AND OUR CONSTRUCTION WORK FOR SCATTERED TO THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE EARTH E STILL HAVE NOT RECOVERED. FROM OUR LOSS OF THE CONSTRUCTION WORK FORCE. FROM THE LAST RECESSION LET'S NOT HAVE THAT HAPPEN AGAIN. AND ONE WAY WE CAN PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING. IS TO INVEST AGGRESSIVELY IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO WE CAN KEEP. OUR CONSTRUCTION WORKFORCE EMPLOYED IN YES THAT MEANS UNIONIZED CONSTRUCTION WORKERS AS WELL. HI SO I AM PROUD TO CO AUTHOR- THIS MEASURE- AND I AM RECOMMENDING- AND I HAVE A CENTER ABOUT AGAIN THANK YOU. AND YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR THE QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS- THIS BILL THIS BILL- WILL PROVIDE. A INFUSION INTO CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY SPECIFICALLY AT THE RIGHT TIME AND THE RIGHT MOMENT THAT IS NEEDED. IN TERMS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONSTRUCTION AS WELL AS SOLVE ONE OF THE VEXING- SOCIAL PROBLEMS WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA HOW TO FUND ONGOING BASIS. PROGRAMS FOR HOMELESSNESS- CONSTRUCTION OF FACILITIES FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE HOMELESS THE BILL ELIMINATE PAYING SOCIAL TRAGEDY LIKE TO ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS- FIRST OF ALL OF THIS THIS IS THE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE HERE OR PRETTY MUCH SEVERAL OF THE SAME PROGRAMS AS FOR SIMPLICITY'S PURPOSES AS WERE APPROVED BY THE VOTERS IN PROPOSITION ONE THE BOND PROGRAM THERE- SIMPLE. OF THE STAFF IS OPERATING. THOSE PROP ONE FUNDS THIS PROP ONE FUNDS WILL BE. ALLOCATED AND THE NEXT YEAR TWO TWO YEARS WILL BE GONE. WE NEED TO HAVE A REPLACEMENT. WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING- THE COMES AFTER THAT. SO IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE THOSE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL. UNDER PROPOSITION ONE APPROVED BY THE VOTERS OVERWHELMINGLY IN CALIFORNIA THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF THOSE PROBLEMS THE WORKFORCE INVESTMENT BOARD ISSUE. WORKFORCE INVESTMENT BOARD SHOULD RECEIVE MORE MONEY YES THEY NEED MORE MONEY TO DEVELOP ARE SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE NOW MORE THAN EVER BECAUSE WE NEED PEOPLE TO BE TRAINED AND GOOD PAYING JOBS SO THEY CAN GET OFF PUBLIC ASSISTANCE AND- FEED THEIR FAMILIES RIGHT NOW THIS BILL IS THE ONE BILL THAT PROVIDES TRAINING. FUNDING THAT I'VE SEEN TIMES ANY OTHER BILLS I WOULD CITY. OTHER BILLS BY ANY OTHER AGENCIES TO PROVIDE- JOB TRAIN THE ONLY OTHER BUILDING DID IT WAS SB ONE. WHICH PROVIDE A FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FOR FIVE YEARS AND EVEN THAT WASN'T ENOUGH MONEY. SO OF GOOD CENTER FOR LOS ANGELES IS CORRECT WE NEED TO HAVE MORE. FUNDING FOR SKILLED IN TRADE PROGRAMS WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. THIS IS THE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE HERE WILL NOT VIOLATE ANY. LAND USE GENERAL PLAN AND THEY HAVE TO BE APPROVED BY THE CITY'S. THEY WILL NOT ENCOURAGE I HAVEN'T ENCOURAGE IN THE PAST SPRAWLING DEVELOPMENT SO I DON'T THINK THE THAT. IS A IS A GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THIS. I ALSO THINK THAT. THE PROGRAMS WE CAN LOOK AT THE PROGRAMS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SMALL SCALE EIGHTY YOU INVESTMENTS ARE ALLOWED WITH SOME OF THE PROGRAMS I THINK THAT. THAT IS- LOGICAL THING TO DO WILL WORK ON THAT. WITH THE GOOD CENTER FROM FREMONT. SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN HERE JOHN I WROTE ON THE MEASURE.

I THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR AND I'M DOING GREAT I HOPE YOUR AS WELL. MY COLLEAGUES I SENATE BILL EIGHT NINETY NINE. IS AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING BILLS. THAT MAKES CERTAIN TYPES OF UNDER UTILIZED LAND. SPECIFICALLY LAND THAT IS OWNED BY NONPROFIT HOSPITALS. NONPROFIT COLLEGE. COLLEGES AND- NONPROFIT THOUGHT FAIH BASED ORGANIZATIONS. AVAILABLE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT- TO BE CLEAR THIS BILL IS LIMITED TO ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. SUBSIDIZE BELOW MARKET RATE. OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE BILL IS CO SPONSORED BY THE TWO LARGEST AFFORDABLE HOUSING COALITION. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION NONPROFIT HOUSING. OR SCAM AND THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND PH. UNDER SB PROJECTS WILL BE PERMITTED UNDER ZONING AND STREAMLINED. IF THEY'RE BUILT ON LANDS OWNED BY ONE OF THE AFOREMENTIONED NONPROFITS AND AB CERTAIN CRITERIA SO THAT THEY- ARE APPROPRIATE FOR THE GIVEN NEIGHBORHOOD. FOR EXAMPLE A DEVELOPMENT LOCAL LOCATED IN A RESIDENTIAL SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOOD- IT CAN BE UP TO THREE STORIES TALL- OR THE LOCAL HEAD OF THE LOCAL IT IS TALLER- AND A DEVELOPMENTS IN A MIXED USE A COMMERCIAL AREA. CAN BE UP TO FIVE STORIES TALL UNLESS A LOCAL HAVEN THAT. IS TALLER. IT WOULD BE PRICES ARE CHARGED FOR THESE AFFORDABLE UNITS WHICH MUST BE DEED RESTRICTED. I MUST BE ON AVERAGE AFFORDABLE TO PEOPLE THAT MEET DEFINITION. OF LOW INCOME VERY LOW INCOME OR EXTREMELY LOW INCOME THE AVERAGE JUST BE NO HIGHER THAN CONSISTENT WITH FEDERAL AND STATE FAIR HOUSING LAW EVERY HOUSING UNIT IN ITS DEVELOPMENT MUST NOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST ANY PROTECT THE CLASS. QUITTING RACE ETHNICITY. AND SO FORTH.

SENATOR Y. KASKI. YES THINKING MISTER VICE CHAIR I WAS LOOKING AT A WERE BASE TEN SOCIETY IN THAT YEAR WELL THE ALLOWANCES THIRTY FIVE UNITS PER ACRE AND I WAS WONDERING IF HE WOULD CONSIDER A FRIENDLY AMENDMENT TO MAKE THAT THIRTY SIX UNITS PER ACRE A SET OF A QUARTER ACRE DIVIDES NATURALLY AND NINE WHICH WOULD ALLOW FIVE PARKING SPOTS IN A PODIUM PARKING. THE CONFIGURATION THAT WE GO IN IT MAY BE EASIER FOR ADVOCATES INSTEAD OF A POINT EIGHT UNITS PER PER PER ACRE OR PER QUARTER RECORD THAT YOU GET IN SO THAT'S JUST A FRIENDLY. AMENDMENT ARE A SUGGESTION. N. LIKE WISE I KNOW THAT WHEN I WAS ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION BACK IN FREMONT EVERYBODY LIKES A TEN FOOT HIGH. TRACK HOME BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT CALIFORNIA BUILD BART BUT WHAT THAT OR TEN FOOT. PER A STORY AND THAT CREATES AN EIGHT FOOT CEILINGS AND WE'VE LEARNED IN THE WITH THE- WITH RENOVATIONS PEOPLE TO IS THAT IF YOU ADD ANOTHER FOOT TO THE LIVING SPACE IT REALLY CREATES A LARGER SENSE SPACE. AND PERHAPS A SMALLER ENVIRONMENT I LEARNED AT ON WORK WITH THE EXCESS RE DWELLING UNITS IN THE HIGH I KNOW A LOT OF CITY SEVEN THIRTY SEVEN FOOT. UP A- MAN THEIR SIT FAMILY HOMES CAN BE BUT BUT IF YOU'RE ANTICIPATING PODIUM PARKING FOR FIVE SPOTS THREE LEVELS WITH YOU KNOW THREE PEOPLE THREE UNITS. AN EXTRA FOOT OR TWO FEET MADE THE DIFFERENCE IN A VERY ENJOYABLE LIVING SPACE IS ARE JUST SOME. OBSERVATIONS IF THE AUTHOR WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT. SENATOR WOULD YOU LIKE ME COMMENTED THAT. GIVE ME I'M ON THE ON THE FIRST- MATT- ISSUE I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT WE WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THAT- AND- CLEARLY ONE MAKE A SIMPLE SO THANK YOU FOR THAT- AND IN TERMS OF THE- THE HEIGHTS IT'S NOT IT'S INTENDED TO BE THREE STORIES AND THE RESIDENTIAL AREAS FIVE STORIES. AND A COMMERCIAL MIXED USE AREAS- AND- SO THAT'S WHY I MADE I BELIEVE IS THIRTY FIVE AND FIFTY FIVE P. WITH THE IDEA BEING THAT USUALLY WANT THE GROUND FLOOR TO BE A LITTLE BIT. HOLD TAL THE IDEA THE HOT FOR. THE A TEN FOOT CEILINGS ON BUT OUR HAPPY TO GO BACK TAKE A LOOK THAT AS WELL GUY I JUST THINK THERE'S THE STUFF IN BETWEEN THE SHEET ROCK IN THE OTHER AND THE SAME THING WITH THE PODIUM PARKING IF THIS PODIUM THING YOU KNOW YEAH A LOT OF PEOPLE FOR SAFETY LIKE TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S TO. THREE PETER FOUR FEET X. A BIG DIFFERENCE FOR THAT SENSE OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD BUT THE OTHER MATT MISTER VICE CHAIR ANOTHER ISSUE I'D JUST LIKE TO RAISE IS I'M OUT. I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT IF CHURCHES BILL THESE THESE HOUSING UNITS THEY'LL BE FULL FLEDGED DISCRIMINATION BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT. IMPLICIT BIAS IN SOME SORT OF LIMITATIONS. THAT THESE CHURCHES WILL ALLOW RENTERS OR PEOPLE TO COME ON THE PROPERTY SO. I URGE THE AUTHOR TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE FULL FAITH OF THE CALIFORNIA. ANTI DISCRIMINATION LAWS ARE EMBRACED ON THESE THESE PRIVATE VENTURES BECAUSE- WELL HE JUST WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT EVERYBODY HAS AN OPPORTUNITY LOOKED. ON THE SPOTS AND I DON'T I'M NOT. POINTING FINGERS OF EVERYBODY BEING ILL WILLED BUT I JUST THINK THAT SOMETHING HAPPENED- THAT. THAT WE MAY FIND SAID ART INCLUDE IN THE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR VARIETY DIFFERENT REASONS. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR. THANK YOU. SENATOR ALSO YES. THANK YOU I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR INTRODUCING BILL THAT IS REALLY FOCUSED ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING I THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THE BIGGEST CRISIS WITHIN THE HOUSING CRISIS THAT WE ALL HAVE TO BE. COMMITTED TO AND A ALL YOU'RE ALSO BELIEVE THAT DOING THIS BY RIGHT OBVIOUSLY IS INTENDED TO SPEED THE SUBS SO THAT WE COULD MOVE FORWARD AND DO THIS- IT IN A WAY THAT ARE REALLY OF HAS IMPACT I AM RAISING UPAN ISSUE ABOUT IT'S AN ONGOING ISSUE I THINK WITH THE REST OF THESE BILLS AS WELL IS THAT THEY SHOULDN'T BE A CONTRADICTION WITH A SUPPORTING HIGH QUALITY JOBS AND OF A TRAINED WORK FOR A QUALITY TRAIN FOR SO. I SUPPORT ABOUT THE- BUT TO PLEASE INCLUDE LABOR ARE ON THE BILL WHICH INCLUDE BOTH PREVAILING WAGE AND A SKILLED AND TRAINED QUALITY OF WORKFORCE PROGRAMS Q. ANY OTHER A- COMMENTS FROM OUR MEMBERS IS THAT IT WAS THAT A QUESTION OR IS THAT. A COMMON. DIRECTOR. THANK RESPONSIBLE. YEAH THE ONLY. WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADDRESS THAT DOWN YES MISTER BY SERVE A GOOD YEAH. SO I THANK YOU I CENTER THERE ALSO CORRECT THAT ISSUE- SO- I'VE BEEN IN- LIKE THAT OFFICE FOR A DECADE NOW. BOTH LOCAL AND NOW FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS IN THE SENATE- AND DURING THAT TIME ENTIRE TIME PERIOD- I'VE WORKED HAND IN GLOVE WITH THE BUILDING TRADES. LOCALLY AT THE STATE LEVEL. AS A MEMBER OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS I WAS CONSISTENTLY. PART OF EFFORTS TO EXPAND ODJICK LABOR AGREEMENTS I'VE BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF HAVING A CITY WIDE LA. HI IN SAN FRANCISCO. AND HERE IN THE SENATE- I'VE BEEN CONSISTENTLY COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE STATE BUILDING TRADES ON THE VARIOUS PIECES OF HOUSING LEGISLATION ARE CARRIED. OVER THE YEARS STARTING WITH SB THIRTY FIVE WHERE WE NEGOTIATED A VERY SOLID A PREVAILING WAGE UNSKILLED WORKFORCE- AGREEMENT- WITH THE STATE BUILDING TRADES. I SENSE ON MY PRACTICE IS RIGHT WHEN WE ARE PURSUING HOUSING LEGISLATION WE ALERT THE TRADES EARLY ON TO GET THEIR FEEDBACK EARLY ON. AND WE WORK IT OUT. USUALLY TO POSITION OF A SUPPORT. SO I PUT MY MONEY WHERE MY MOUTH IS WHEN IT COMES TO WORKING WITH THE BUILDING TRADES I'M A STRONG BELIEVER IN ENSURING THAT ARE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS ARE NOT ONLY NOT. POVERTY WAGES BETTER PAY WAGES. WHERE THEY CAN BE PART OF THE MIDDLE CLASS AND HAVE A SHOT AT A FOURTEEN THE HOUSING THAT THEY ARE. BUILDING THAT IS A CORE VALUE FOR ME AND I AM HAPPY OF COURSE TO WORK WITH THE BUILDING TRADES. AND OTHER UNIONS. ARE ON SB EIGHT NINETY NINE- AND- MY ATTENTION WILL BE TO CLOSE- BRING STAKEHOLDER GROUP TOGETHER- THE TRADES AS WELL AS- THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. COMMUNITY THIS IS NOT A NEW ISSUE IN TERMS OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THOSE TWO COMMUNITIES AS I THINK PEOPLE WHO FOLLOW THIS KNOWS SOME AROUND TWENTY YEARS AGO. THERE WAS LEGISLATION PASSED TO REQUIRE THAT IF THERE'S ANY STATE MONEY- AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT IT MUST PAY PREVAILING WAGE THAT WAS A FIGHT. WHEN I WAS PASSED WITH OPEN WE WAS PASSED. SHIFTING FROM NINE TO MANDATE A SKILLED WORKFORCE AND- HUNDREDS AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. I'M NOT COMMENTING ON NOT CRITICIZING THAT CHANGED THE NOTING THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT. CHANGE IN STATE POLICY PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE CONVERSATION TO HAVE AND I WILL CONVENE. THAT ROUND TABLE TO HAVE A DISCUSSION. I DO JUST WANT TO KNOW POLITICS SINCE I DO HAVE A HISTORY OF WORKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE TRADES WE INTRODUCED THIS BILL. SB NINE NINE IN THE MIDDLE OF FEBRUARY HREE AND A HALF MONTHS AGO. WE SENT IT TO THE TRADES. THAT'S FEEDBACK DO NOT GET ANY CRITICAL FEEDBACK ON THE BILL AT ALL. AND THE NEXT I HEARD FROM THE STATE BUILDING TRADES IS WHEN I GOT A PHONE CALL YESTERDAY. ON MEMORIAL DAY AT THREE O'CLOCK EIGHTEEN HOURS HEARING- ASKING THAT I WOULD IT'S CALLED WORKFORCE- PROVISION IN THE BILL. IT WAS COURSE TOO LATE. TO CONSIDER SUCH A BIG CHANGE WITHOUT A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS- WITH AND RECEIVE THE OFFICIAL LETTERS. WHEN TRADES LATE LAST NIGHT. WELL PASSED THE COMMITTEE BUT IT ONLINE AND FROM THE OTHER UNIONS THIS MORNING FIFTEEN MINUTES BEFORE THE HEARING BEGAN. THE TEAMSTERS ARE NOT SUBMITTED A LETTER- I WILL ALSO SAY THAT OTHER THAN. MISTER HUNTER FROM THE STATE BUILDING TRADES NONE OF THESE OTHER UNIONS HAVE REACH OUT TO ME. EITHER BY LETTER. BEFORE THIS MORNING OR BY PHONE. SO I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE TRADE AS I ALWAYS HAVE. ON IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE A COLLABORATIVE. RESPECTFUL PROCESS WORKING WITH ME AS AUTHOR AND WORKING WITH A ROBUST AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMMUNITY. AND I'M HOPING WE CAN SET THE RESET BUTTON- AND HAD A KIND OF COLLABORATIVE- RESPECTFUL PROCESS AND I AM COMMITTED TO DOING MASSIVE THANK YOU SENATOR ROSS OF RAISING THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. BOB WAS THERE ANY MORE SENATOR ROBB. THE BILL OKAY SENATOR MORE LOCK- GO AHEAD THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR. CENTER WIENER. I'M I'M HAVING REAL DIFFICULTY NOW- WITH- WONDERING WHY A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT WOULD EVEN HAVE TO ENTER INTO SOME OF THESE BY RIGHT TRANSACTIONS WERE ALREADY TREADING ON PRETTY SENSITIVE TERRITORY- AYE AYE I WANT TO SUPPRT THE BILL I PLAN ON VOTING FOR TODAY BUT- I RESERVE THE RIGHT THEN IT YOU'RE GONNA MAKE SOME AMENDMENTS THAT MIGHT THAT TO THE COSTS OF LEGITIMATE ATTEMPTS TO BUILD EXTRA HOUSING. I'M I MAY. CHANGED MY MIND I JUST. WANTED LEAST THROW THAT IN AS YOU. REVIEW THESE ISSUES THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER. OKAY. HE SENATOR MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR I I'LL BE VERY QUICK MESSAGE YOUR LOOK I THINK THAT THE BOTTOM LINE FOR ME IN SENATOR WIENER- WHILE- WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO WORK THROUGH OUR DIFFERENCES ON HOUSING HE HAS A HE'S HAD A RECORD TO BETTER TACKLE THE TOUGH IT IS AN ENGAGING ROBUST CONVERSATION AND LET'S BE HONEST THERE'S BEEN SOME WINS AND LOSSES JUST LIKE WE ALL HAVE. BUT HE HAS BEEN CONSISTENT IN WORKING WITH THE HARD WORKING MEN WOMEN OF THE TRADES AND WANTED TO SAY HOW GRATEFUL WE ARE- FOR THEM CHIMING IN TO IN ADVANCING THE CONCERNS THE ENDPOINT THOUGH THE ENDPOINT HAS ALWAYS BEEN WITH SENATOR WE- A- THAT. WE END UP TOGETHER. I AM CONFIDENT THAT THIS IS WHERE THIS DISCUSSION WILL AIM IS WELL- BY WORKING TOGETHER IN. THE CHALLENGE I THINK THAT WE ALL FACE RIGHT NOW IS IN THIS TIME OF TRUNCATED SCHEDULES DUE TO THE PANDEMIC. AND ARE LEGISLATIVE DEADLINES. THIS BILL WILL ONLY BE HEARD IN ONE POLICY COMMITTEE BUT DO TRUST CENTER WINNER OF ADVANCING THAT ROBUST INPUT PROCESS THAT WILL BE HAPPY WITH STAKEHOLDERS THAT WILL BE A IT WOULD BE DIRECTLY WORKING WITH HIM. IN YEAH YOU HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILL AND I THINK THE IMPORTANT PART ABOUT THIS IS THAT AS- WINNER IS ALWAYS PERSON DOES WORK- IN ADVANCE IN THOSE SOLUTIONS IN A COLLABORATIVE MANNER SO. THAT WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS KNOWING THAT THERE WILL NEED TO BE ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION HERE IN THE WEEKS TO COME IN THANK YOU CENTER WITH. OKAY SENATOR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR COLLEAGUES I WANT A THANK YOU FOR YOUR FEEDBACK- THERE ARE OF COURSE GOING TO BE A LOT OF OPINIONS ON THIS BILL ONLY BECAUSE IT'S AN IMPACTFUL BILL THIS BILL WILL HELP FACILITATE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING OVER TIME IT'S AN IMPORTANT BILL- YES WE HAVE WORK TO DO AND I'M COMMITTED TO DOING THAT.

MCGUIRE MORE LOOK. MORE LIKE A ROCK. ROTH AYE SKINNER AYE SKINNER AYE NUMBER. WITH CASKEY HI WITH HEALTHCARE I NINE VOTES. NINE EYES AND WILL HOLD THAT WILL PUT THAT BILL ON CALL FOR- SOME OF OUR OTHER SENATORS WILL BE HERE IN A WHILE. WOULD YOU. SENATOR WIENER WOULD YOU LIKE TO PRESENT SB NINE OH TWO I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR VICE CHAIR TALK POLITICS SENATE BILL NINE OH TWO IS A YOUR LOCAL CONTROL BILL I IN FACT DEAD HI INCREASES LOCAL CONTROL BY ALLOWING CITIES-TO ACCELERATE. THERE'S ONLY PROCESS DISPLAYED- THE STATE LAW THAT CAN OFTEN MAKE THAT PROCESS TAKES YEARS OR EVEN A DECADE SB NINE OH TO CREATE A POWERFUL NEW TOOL THAT CITIES CAN CHOOSE TO USE OR CHOOSE NOT TO YOU'RE- I THIRTY BASIC HOUSING DENSE. AND THIS WAY. THE BILL LIMITS NEW TOOL THE HOUSING UP TO TEN UNITS. LOCATED IN URBAN INFILL. FOR A JOB RICHARD TRANSIT RICH AREA IN ORDER TO AVOID SPRAWL. ARE THE BILL IS A PART OF THE SENATE HOUSING PACKAGE AND I WANT TO THANK HER FOR TEN CENTER ATKINS WHO WAS A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR OF THE BILL. UNDER CURRENT LAW WHEN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT INITIATES REZONING I CITY DECIDES THEY WANT TO HAVE MORE DENSITY IN A PARTICULAR PART OF THEIR CITY- THE REZONING MUST GO THROUGH EXTENSIVE SEQUEL REVIEW. AND CAN IS VULNERABLE TO APPEALS SERIAL LAWSUITS EVEN IF THE UP SEVENTY IS EXCLUSIVELY FOCUSED ON MILE DENSITY INCREASES. AND URBAN INFILL JOB IN TRANSIT RICH COMMUNITIES. AS A RESULT CITIES THAT WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING THAT WANT TO DO WHAT WE'RE ASKING THEM TO DO WHICH IS HIS OWN FOR MORE HOUSING. CAN FACE A LENGTHY CAN BE AS MUCH AS FIVE OR TEN YEARS. AND VERY EXPENSIVE PROCESS- IN ORDER TO DO WHAT WE'RE ASKING THEM TO DO AND THIS CREATES A MAJOR DISINCENTIVE FOR CITIES. TO RESULT AND WITH THE CHANGES TO THE REASON A HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT- DUE TO SB EIGHT TWO EIGHT WAS A AUTHORED A FEW YEARS AGO WHICH IS LEADING TO SIGNIFICANT INCREASES AND CITIES HOUSING GOALS THEY WILL NEED TO ENGAGE IN REZONING TO MEET THOSE GOALS WE SHOULD MAKE IT. EASIER FOR THE- ON SB NINE OF TWO CHANGES THE STATE OF AFFAIRS. BY THE CLARION THAT THE DECISION TO ADOPT. AN UPS ONING. IF IT IS AN INFILL TRANSIT OR JOB AREA NOT SPRAWL. AND IF IT'S UP TO TEN UNITS- IS NOT A PROJECT IN THE SEQUEL. AS LONG AS IT MADE ME SEE SUSTAINABILITY. CRITERIA INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENTS CONSISTENT WITH THESE PLANS. WILL REQUIRE WILL HAVE TO MEET ALL LOCAL REQUIREMENTS. FOR THE DESIGN REVIEW IMPACT FEES- THEY CAN BE SUCH AS THE PLANNING COMMISSION DISCRETIONARY REVIEW BY THE CITY THEY ALSO- WILL BE SUBJECT TO WHATEVER HEIGHT LIMIT- THE CITY SETS SERVICES LOCAL CONTROL. THE BILL HAS SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL TO EMPOWER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PURSUE MORE EQUITABLE OF SURNAMES FOR SMALL SCALE. AND MEDIUM DENSITY CONSTRUCTION. IN SYSTEM WITH FAIR HOUSING LAWS. IN ADDITION BY FOCUSING ON THE SMALLER PROJECTS AS UNITED TO PROMOTE ITS NEW HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES FOR FIRST TIME BUYERS AS WELL AS PROMOTING NATURALLY INEXPENSIVE. WOOD FRAME CONSTRUCTION CONSISTING WITNESSES MISSING MIDDLE NEEDS IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. REGARDING THE OPPOSITION TO THE BILL- AND I DON'T SCORE SPEAK FOR ANY OPPONENTS THIS BILL WAS AMENDED ON THE SAME DAY THAT THE OPPOSITION LETTER DEADLINE WAS- AND UNTIL LAST WEDNESDAY IN ADDITION TO THOSE VOLUNTARY STREAMLINED OF ZONING ALSO CONTAINED A REQUIREMENT TO ALLOWED DUPLEX TRI PLEX. FOR PARKS AND LOOKING AT THE OPPOSITION LETTERS THAT APPEARS TO BE THE FOCUS THE REQUIREMENT THE CITY'S ALLOWED DUPLEX TRIPLEX FOUR BUCKS AND OF COURSE WHEN THEY CENTERS OPPOSITION THEY HAVEN'T SEEN OUR AMENDMENTS THAT REMOVE THAT FROM THE BILL ENTIRELY AND THE REASON WE REMOVED IT. BECAUSE IS IN SB A TWENTY BY THE PRO TEM. THAT INCLUDE THE STATE WIDE DUPLEX AND LOTS SPLIT REQUIREMENTS SO UP TO FOUR UNITS FOR PARCEL. AND SO THAT. TOOK CARE OF THAT AREA AND WE DIDN'T WAN TO DUPLICATE OR HAVE ANY KIND OF INCONSISTENT- APPROACH TO REMOVE IT FROM OUR BILL AND I SIGNED ON AS A JOINT AUTHORED. TO THE PROTONS BILL- AND SO I KNOW THAT SOME OF THE OPPOSITION AND MYBE THE BOOK OF THE OPPOSITION HAS REALLY BEEN FOCUSING. ON A PROVISION THAT WAS REMOVED ON THE SAME DAY THAT THE OPPOSITION LETTERS WERE DO- AGAIN NOT SPEAKING FOR THE OPPOSITION WITH THAT IS AT LEAST MY- PERCEPTION THIS IS NOW A BILL THAT GIVES A VOLUNTARY. POWER NEW TOOL FOR CITIES TO BE ABLE TO CHOOSE TO UPS ON A STREAMLINED AND LESS EXPENSIVE WAY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR ON A VOTE TESTIFYING TODAY ARE. ARE SPONSOR IS RESTING ON ITS TO HOLLY OFFER MANY FROM HABITAT FOR HUMANITY. AND THE RESTAURANT TODAY FROM CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. YES AN ADJUSTER MINOR THEY'LL BE A TOTAL THREE MINUTES TO- TESTIFY.

I THINK CENTER WIENER DID AN EXCELLENT JOB COVERING THE DETAILS OF THE BILL. SO I'M JUST GOING TO FOCUS ON- WHY WE'RE SUPPORTING IT- THIS BILL CALLED THE REAL PROBLEM THAT ARE LOCAL ALLIES AROUND THE STATE ESPECIALLY IN. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND FLAGGED FOR US- JURISDICTIONS ARE CAUGHT. BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE AND NEEDING TO COMPLY WITH THE BEING REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION- AND POTENTIALLY FACING A LAWSUIT FROM A NEW MEET IN THEIR AREA FOR DOING SO. I WE THINK THAT AS NINE OH TWO IT'S GONNA. REALLY HELP CALIFORNIA PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED HOUSING. AND IF YOU KNOW THE NINETEEN HAS RENDERED THE HOUSING CRISIS IN QUITE PAINFUL CLARITY FOR EVERYONE IN THE STATE. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WORK AT THAT HOMEBUILDING WILL DROP 21% THIS YEAR I 21% BELOW A NUMBER THAT WOULD. HOW OCTOBER NINETEEN IS ALSO THE POTENTIALLY REDUCE LOCAL RENT MEETING THAT AT ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT TO PROTECT THE JURISDICTION THEIR PLANS FOR COMBINED WITH THE BUT THE HOUSING ELEMENT LAW FOR LISTING COSTLY LAWSUITS FOR THE MORE. RECENT RESEARCH FROM THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF HOME BUILDERS FIND THE BUILDING A THOUSAND POUNDS IN CREATE TWO THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FULL TIME JOBS. AND GENERATE ALMOST A HUNDRED AND ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN TAXES AND FEES FOR ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. SUPPORT LIKE POLICE FIREFIGHTERS AND SCHOOLS ARE SOMETHING ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT- AS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE FACING NOT THE BUDGET SHORTFALLS IF YOU'RE ALL WHERE.

HOUSTON OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL FOR MANY REASONS STATED IN MY EARLIER COMMENT ON THE PREVIOUS BILL THANK. THERE'S NO ONE OUT IN THE QUEUE. OKAY IF THERE ARE NO MORE WITNESSES IN THE QUEUE- WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR WHO WAS IN SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION WITNESSES WILL NOW BRING THIS DISCUSSION BACK TO THE MEMBERS MEMBERS ANY. SENATOR DORADO PLACE YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I WANT TO AGAIN APPLY THE AUTHOR FOR LOOKING FOR HOW WE CAN CREATE OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE IN INFILL DEVELOPMENT. I BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW FIRST OF ALL THIS IS A STREAMLINING PROCESS BILL. UP BUT WE'RE ALSO LEGISLATIVELY GOING THROUGH A STREAMLINING PROCESS I MEAN THIS IS SOMETHING THAT NO ONE OF US HAVE VERY EXPERIENCED I THINK IT'S REALLY JOLTED US INTO HOW DO WE ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AND- I THINK WE SHOULD. EXPECT THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE GETTING A LOT OF LAST MINUTE CONVERSATION SO I JUST I JUST WANT TO REMIND US ALL OF THAT- SO I WONDER REYES- A THREE ISSUES- AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN ESTABLISH THEM. AS SOME GOOD FRIENDS OF MINE CALL IT HARD RAILS OF ONE IS. TO PREVENT BUILDING HOUSING IN OVERCROWDED AREAS- TO IS TO PREVENT AND- PROTECT ROSE FROM THIS BECOMING SHORT TERM RENTALS AND OR HOTELS AND THREE. TO ENSURE AS I SAID EARLIER AND THE PREVIOUS BILL- THE LABOR STANDARDS SO I WANT TO BRING TO EVERYONE'S ATTENTION OF THE PROBLEM OF OVERCROWDING AND SEVERE OVERCROWDING- IT IS AN ISSUE IN MANY CITIES ACROSS THE STATE WHILE THERE ARE AREAS ACROSS THE STATE THAT HAVE. ZERO OVERCROWDING OF FOR EXAMPLE IN MY DISTRICT APPROXIMATELY 50% OF THE CENSUS TRACKS AND TUNED IN JUST TO NEIGHBORHOODS IN BOYLE HEIGHTS AND WESLEY HAVE OVERCROWDED- HOUSEHOLDS YOU SEE DID AN OVERCROWDING- STUDY. OVERCROWDING MEANS MORE THAN ONE PERSON PER ONE ROOM IN THE IN THE UNIT MORE THAN ONE PERSON PER PER ROOM SO MAD CHEN NEIGHBORHOOD- I. I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT A BY RIGHT PROCESS WILL BE USED IN THESE OVER CROWDED AREAS AND IT WILL WORSEN EXISTING HOUSING AND FRANKLY WHAT COMES FROM OVERCROWDING ARE HEALTH ISSUES AND SAFETY CONCERNS- HEALTH ISSUES THAT ARE PERMANENT. FOR CHILDREN GROWING UP IN OVERCROWDED CROWDED AREAS AW IT HAS A BIG IMPACT ON THEIR LEARNING- THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH ALREADY TRACKS OVERCROWDING AND WE CAN USE THAT DATA TO ENSURE THAT HOUSING THE BUILD IS BUILT IN AREAS WITH SUFFICIENT SPACE. AS I MENTIONED JUST TO NEIGHBORHOODS IN MY DISTRICT BUT I ALSO HAVE NEIGHBORHOODS LIKE CLOSE FAMILIES SWITCHES ZERO EIGHT PERCENT- IN OTHER PARTS OF LOS ANGELES WE HAVE SOUTH LA 3250% OVERCROWDING BUT WE HAVE SHERMAN OAKS WITH ZERO TO FIVE PERCENT. AND BEL AIR WITH 0% SO THERE ARE. THE BIGGEST CONCERN IS THOSE AREAS THAT ARE OVERCROWDED AND THE IMPACT THAT IT WILL HAVE ON THEM. THE SECOND ONE IS- THAT AS WE STREAMLINED HOUSING UNITS. I AM. THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT IS NOT GOING TO CREATE A SHORT TERM RENTALS OR HAVE HOTELS SKEWS ME. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS DOESN'T BECOME AN OPPORTUNITY FOR NEW SHORT TERM RENTAL UNITS THAT'S NOT THE KIND OF HOUSING THAT WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT. AND AGAIN I JUST WANNA- ECKEL- THE CONCERNS OVER THE LABOR STANDARDS- SO AGAIN- I HOPE THAT WE CAN BRING EVERYONE I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT THE STAKEHOLDERS WILL MEET AT AND- AND FIGURE OUT SOLUTIONS TO THOSE ISSUES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. MOVE THE BILL. I CENTER I KASKI THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR- THROUGH THE VICE CHAIR TO THE AUTHOR I'M WONDERING THESE MAPS THAT YOU WE ANTICIPATE FROM THE BILL FOR THE TRANSIT RICH AREAS AND THE JOBS RICH AREAS WHY THOSE ARE NOT WITH THE AGENCY THAT DEALS WITH TRANSPORTATION- DEALS WITH JOBS PURCHASE VERSUS ATD WHICH HAS A LOT. ON THEIR PLATE YEAH. MISTER VICE CHAIR OF THE AUTHOR COULD ANSWER. SENATOR WIENER PLAYTIME SO ON THE BIG PICTURE- EIGHT CITY IS UNDERSTAFFED. THEY'VE GONE THROUGH A MAJOR MANAGEMENT TRANSITION THE DIRECTOR RULES BEACON METCALF FOR FISHING SIX MONTHS NOW BEEN FILLED- AND I THINK ANYONE WHO WORKS IN THE HOUSING CONSTRUCTION ADVOCACY WORLD. KNOWS THAT ISSUE THE NEEDS SUPPORT MY VIEW IS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WERE BOLSTERING THE AGENCIES THAT ARE CONTRARY TO WHAT. JOB BUT GREAT PEOPLE DOING GREAT WORK THERE BUT THERE AREN'T ENOUGH PEOPLE KNOW TOO MANY VACANCIES. SO I ALSO OF THE VIEW THAT WE SHOULD HAVE A CABINET LEVEL HOUSING AGENCY WITH THE SECRETARY OF HOUSING AND REPORTING DIRECTLY TO THE GOVERNOR THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER ISSUE- IN TERMS OF DOING THESE MAPS. EIGHT CITY ALREADY OVERSEAS MAPPING BECAUSE MAPPING HAS TO HAPPEN IN VARIOUS RELY HOUSING. PROGRAMS AROUND WHAT WE CALL HIGH OPPORTUNITY. AREAS WHICH IS WE DO WITH THE SAME AS AS JOB RECALL JOB WHICH WAS WAY HIGH PATERNITY. SO THEY ALREADY. FOR BERKELEY WHO DO THIS MAPPING. I SAW THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS ALREADY THERE TO DO THE MAPPINGS IT'S NOT DONE IN HOUSE AT THE CITY VERY THE CONTRACT OUT TO DO IT. AND SO I THINK THEY WILL BE ABLE TO DO THIS SEAMLESSLY. BUT YOU DO NEED TO STEP IT UP BECAUSE IT TOO MANY VACANCIES. SO I TOTALLY THAT THIS IS TOTALLY VOLUNTARILY VOLUNTARY FOR ANY CITY THAT WANTS TO DO IT SO I GET THAT PART OF IT BUT WITH THAT SAID THIS IS A HUGE SEQUEL EXEMPTION THEIR CREATION OF A SEQUEL EXEMPTION FOR TEN UNITS ON A PARCEL NOT TEN UNITS ON AN ACRE TEN UNITS ON A PARCEL IS THERE ANYTHING IN THIS BILL THAT PROHIBITS SOMEBODY FROM. COLLECTING WERE ASSEMBLING OVER A SEVERAL PARCELS IN ORDER TO DEVELOP CREATED DEVELOPMENT THAT MAY HAVE FOR PARCELS ON IT BUT IT LOOKS LIKE ONE LOCKED. THE VICE SENATOR WINNER YES IT IS THE CITY WILL HAVE EVERY OF. WHEN THEY THIS THREE TO. AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO TO TENURE SO CAN SAY WE'RE GOING TO DO TO PART HERE OR FOUR PLUS. FOR SIX BUCKS HERE IN CLOCKS THERE THREE CAN GO ANYWAY FROM TWO TEN I DON'T HAVE TO GO ALL THE WAY TO THEY ALSO ON DON'T DIDN'T HERE. WHAT IN ANY WAY THAT TO ALLOW A LOT MORE SO FROM IS HASN'T. TO THE TERM WHETHER TO MURDER. LAW FIVE WHETHER IT'S A- USE OR WHATEVER IS THAT WILL REMAIN IN PLACE AND CITY. OKAY TO HAVE POWER. TO TREAT ALL OF THESE. PROJECTS UNDER NORMAL APPROVAL RULES HI SO WE'RE NOT IN ANYWAY TAKING AWAY CITIES POWERS AROUND LOT MERGERS A LOT SPLIT SERVER OR HELLO THROUGH PROJECTS BUT SIMPLY ALLOWING THEM IF THEY CHOOSE TO READ OWN IN A MORE STREAMLINED WAY THAT WE'RE NOT MANDATING WHAT THEY DO WITH THE INDIVIDUAL PRIOR OCCASIONS. SO THIS IS SAID IN. NONE THE LESS ON A C. WORK I SEE THE- TO THE EIGHTY YOU BILL MADE ME SO. BECAUSE TYPICALLY WHAT DID IN A SIX EIGHT WAS TO. PEOPLE BOOTLEG YOU INTO THEIR GO. N. I THE BILL THE TERM TO SAY THE OKAY GOING TO MAKE THE THINGS LESS AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE BOOTLEG A UNIT INTO THEIR BACK OUR SO HE JUST WELL IF YOU IF YOU CAN BOOTLEG IT THEIR GARAGE INTO THE INTO BACKING. IT'S LEGAL YOU COULD HAVE TO SO YOU DO GET SOME TENSE. BUT AS ON WITH THAT BUT THE PERCEPTION WAS THAT ARE INVISIBLE NOW IN THE- MY CONCERN IS THAT CREATING THE SICK. INFANTS AT PEACE. WELL MEANING CITY TO A- LOSE ON HUMILITY FACT THAT ACTIVITY WILL HAVE YOU KNOW OF THE THINGS THIS WITH THE IS IT ALLOWS FOR THE STATE. TO COME IN AND COME SO IF YOU HAVE MADE ONE FOUR PLEX MAY ONE TWO PLEX ONE AT SIX PLUS IS YOUR REMOVING OR BILL REMOVE THAT THAT'S PART. IN AN COURSE OF AND ADAPTIVE. SIX RE. YEAH SINCE ACTUAL SIZE MISTER VICE CHAIR THE VOTE THAT CAN ANSWER. US SENATOR WE IF YOU LIKE AND A RESPECTFUL TO MIKE COLLEAGUES IN FREMONT AYE AYE AGREE WITH THAT CAR IS A- FIRST OF ALL THIS E HAVE.

OKAY THANK YOU. SENATOR MORLOCK THANK YOU MISTER BY WIENER LAST MONTHS THE GENERAL IS TAKEN AT ONE OF EIGHTY THE TURN ON DENSE THANKS TO THE COVERED. PANDEMIC SO WHAT WHAT ARE WE ABOUT DENSITY RBC NEW CITY IS BEEN IMPACTED SO FRANCIS BECAUSE BEEN IMPAIR. LAWS ANGELES HAS BEEN IMPACTED SO WHEN SOMEONE SAYS ADDING TEN UNITS TO A PARCEL VERSUS TEN UNITS TO AN ACRE OR SOMETHING THAT. YOUR TO QUANTIFY. WHERE WERE WE LOOKING IN THE FUTURE AS TO WHAT IS AN APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF UNITS ON AN ACRE. I SENATOR WIENER WHICH I CANCER THAT I YES I WOULD VERY MUCH LOVE TO ANSWER QUESTION THE SERVER YOUR THANK YOU CENTER MORE LAW THIS WILL TIE INTO ONE OF THE- CONTACT CENTER TO ROSS SO RAISES WHILE TERMS A CREDIT. RIGHT IT'S A REAL REALLY ARE. AT THE STATE WEST. BETWEEN CROWDING WITH HOME CROWDING WITH AN HOMES. THIRD DENSITY WITH NO WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR OF TO PEOPLE LIVE IN A HOUSE UNIT OR PEOPLE. VERSUS DENSITY OF HOW UNITS THE A NUMBER HOME. AND WE LOOK AT WHAT A RE OF CAN. IT'S NOT YOU KNOW I LIVE IN A THIRTY NINE BUILDING. THAT AND THE BY MYSELF THERE. THAT'S NOT THE REST THE RISK IS YOU HAVE BECAUSE WE HAVE ENOUGH HEALTH AND MAKE IT EXPENSIVE YOU HAVE THREE FAMILIES LIVING TOGETHER AND ONE YOU CROWDING WITH IN THE HOME. AND THE RE THAT YOU HAVE CRAP WITH IN THE HOME. WHICH LEADS TO COULD WITH THE HOME. IS BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T OR NOT HOUSING IT'S EXPENSIVE IT'S REALLY FOR THE CENTURY. OVERCROWDING WITHIN HOMES. PURSES DENSITIES IS BUILDING MORE HOUSING FOR PEOPLE. YOU KNOW ONE OR TWO PEOPLE IT'S THEIR LIVING IN A UNIT AND YOU DON'T HAVE THAT. RISK WITH AN IDEA. BUT I ALL I JUNE THAT THERE BEEN A NAY. BASEBALL'S INACCURATE NARRATIVE STARTED BY THE GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK DIED HOUSING DENSITY IS SOMEHOW TO BLAME FOR COVER NINETEEN SPREAD. NEW YORK REACTED HELLO AND LATE THE CURVE IN NINETEEN TO COMPARE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE BAY AREA WHICH HAD EARLIER EMERGENCE. TO WHAT HAPPENED IN NEW YORK NEW YORK WAS LOW AND LATE AT THE CITY LEVEL AND AT THE STATE LEVEL. I'M NOT SAYING THAT'S THE ONLY FACTOR BUT IT WAS DEFINITELY A REAL FACTOR. AND THEIR PET AND THEY PAID THE PRICE. AND THE CALL BECAUSE WE HAD THIS ONE VERY THAN CITY NEW YORK CITY. THAT HAS HAD A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE WITH CODE. THERE. WAS A LITTLE BIT OF LIKE THAT'S THE BLAME IT WASN'T LATE RESPONSE IS BECAUSE THE DENSITY IN NEW YORK CITY. WELL LET'S LOOK AT THAT. THE SECOND DANCE THE CITY. OF LARGE CITIES IN THE US. IS MY OWN CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO. HI FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW AS OF AT LEAST A DAY OR TWO AGO THE NUMBER OF DEATHS FROM COVER NINETEEN SEVEN CISCO. WAS FORTY. NOW FORTY ONE DAY. FORTY SINCE THE BEGINNING OF A PANDEMIC. NEW YORK JUST ANNOUNCED A MAJOR MILESTONE BUT IT. WENT UNDER ONE HUNDRED DEATHS IN A SINGLE DAY. WE GOT FORTY TWO THAT'S FORTY TOO MANY DOES OF THE TRAGEDIES FORTY FAMILIES THAT ARE IMPACTED TOGETHER. BUT SAN FRANCISCO THE SECOND BENSON CITY IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AMONG LARGER CITIES. HAS DONE REMARKABLY BETTER THAN NEW YORK CITY. OR YOU LOOK AT EVEN LOS ANGELES WHICH HAS HAD MORE PROBLEMS IT'S IN A DIFFERENT UNIVERSE THE NEW YORK CITY AND THERE ARE PARTS OF LA THAT ARE VERY VERY. DENSE WE ALSO LOOK AT SOME OF THE DENSEST CITIES IN THE WORLD SEOUL SOUTH KOREA TAIPEI TAIWAN. HONG KONG TOKYO. SOME OF THE DENSEST CITIES ON THE PLANET. THE STRUGGLE TO COVER NINETEEN LIKE EVERYONE HAS. BUT THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY CONTAIN AT. BECAUSE DESPITE THEIR DENSITY DESPITE HAVING HUGE TRANSIT SYSTEMS. IT HAD EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT RESPONSE QUICK FRENTE AFFECTED. SO THAT'S WHAT DRIVES. PROBABLY NINETEEN LACK OF EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT RESPONSE NOT HOUSING DENSITY WE ARE ALSO SEEING INCREASINGLY LOW DENSITY THAT LOW DENSITY AREAS SUBURBS RURAL AREAS THAT ARE GETTING VERY HARD HAT. WHETHER IT'S NEW SHELL THE YORK A SUBURB THAT GOT HIT. EVEN BEFORE NEW YORK CITY OR OTHER SUBURBS AND RURAL AREAS LOW DENSITY AREAS AROUND THE COUNTRY. BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT LIVING IN AN APARTMENT. YOU'RE STILL GOING TO THEWALMART ACOSTA FOR THE SAFE WAY. STILL GOING TO DIFFERENT AREAS WHERE PEOPLE CONCRETE TOGETHER. AND YOU KNOW I WOULD POSIT THAT BEING IN A COST CODES CROWD IS NO DIFFERENT THAN BEING IN A SUBWAY. RIDE OR SEEING YOU KNOW. IN A PART OF BILL. IF YOU KNOW THE SO THAT'S MY GONNA. WELL STUDY DONE. IN KAGO JR I CHINA. COMPARING THE SPREAD ACROSS NINETEEN. IN THE DANCE AREAS VERSUS THE ELDER. LESS DENSE AREA. AND ALL OF THE START HAVE. THAT THERE IS NO AND- IN INTO RATE. AND ANSWER. CAN COMPARE TO THE NEARBY NINE ERROR AND TO SAY YOU ALL THAT IT. SENATOR SO THAT THE MY TAKE ON YOUR QUESTION I APPRECIATE OPPORTUNITY. AND THANK YOU PROFESSOR. ANY FURTHER QUEST. GARAGE PLATE YEAH JUST. I JUST WANT TO ADD TO MY COMMENTS ABOUT THE- OVERCROWDING. THIS. MY DISEASE IN MY DISTRICT OVERCROWDED NEIGHBORHOODS HAVE FOUR TO SIX PEOPLE PER ROOM. THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND A SOLUTION FOR THEM FOR THOSE FAMILIES FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES. IS NOT A BY RIGHT DENSITY. OF THE SOLUTION FOR THEM IS DIFFERENT IT'S ABOUT FUNDING IT'S ABOUT PRIORITIZING THEM AND SO I JUST YOU KNOW. I'M NOT OPPOSING THE IDEA OF A BY RIGHT YOU KNOW INCREASE IN DENSITY I JUST THINK THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN KEY NEIGHBORHOODS BUT THAT'S NOT THE SOLUTION FOR WHICH IS WHAT I'M ASKING YOU TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION. AND I FRAZIER THAT'S ANOTHER ALSO AND I AGREE WITH YOU ACTUALLY A SOLUTIONS ARE AND- MANY DIFFERENT THINGS BECOMING A- RELEVANT I BELIEVE WE HAVE A CALL- ON SOON FROM SENATOR- PAT BATES. YES HERE I AM HI. YOU HEAR ME GUYS WE CAN YES WE CAN SEE AND HEAR A I JUST WANTED TO LET SEEK A SENATOR WIENER FOR PUTTING LOCAL GOVERNMENT BACK INTO THE DISCUSSION ON THE DANCE VACATION PROPOSED. TO HELP WITH OUR HOUSE ON YOU KNOW SENATOR WINNER MY OPPOSITION TO A NUMBER OF THE BILLS HAD MOSTLY TO DO WITH PUBLIC SAFETY- WHICH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY DESIGNER YEAH HAVING YOU KNOW SIR MANY YEARS ABOUT WELL AND I KNOW OUR PLANNING COMMISSION WHICH ALSO HAS. YES OUR FOCUS PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUES THEN THE TRAY THAT OCCURRED IN MY COMMUNITY MAY YEARS WITH. KANTOR GOVERNOR WALKS GOING. AGAINST THE- A KILLED AND JOB ANOTHER AT EIGHT SIGN ACTUALLY ON THAT WAS BE OF THE PARK CARS SO OVER THE ROOM SO IT'S GIVEN OFFERED FOR LOW GUN TO BE AT THE TWO. TO SEARCH AND HW FOR THE NEW THAT ARE BUT DO IT IN A VERY I THINK QUALITY WAY. THAT'S ALL WE CAN ASK FOR PRE SHAPE WHICH BROUGHT THEM BACK TO TABLE ON THIS BILL. THE MATCH. REGARDING THE CROWDING AND SHORT TERM RENTALS- BECAUSE THIS BILL DOES NOT IN ANY WAY LIMIT THE ABILITY OF CITIES TO EXERCISE THEIR CURRENT POWER TO BAN. OR RESTRICT OR REGULATE SHORT TERM RENTALS I AGREE WE DON'T WANT THESE TO BECOME. HOTELS AND THE CITIES WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO WHATEVER IT IS THEY CHOOSE TO DO IT SPECTER SHORT TERM RENTALS- AND IN TERMS OF CROWDING AGAIN CITIES CAN DECIDE. THIS NEIGHBORHOOD ALREADY TO DANCE WE DON'T WANT TO BE MORE THAN TO WANT TO GO OVER HERE AND THEY CAN MAKE THOSE DECISIONS SO I THINK THESE ARE VERY VALID. CONCERNS AND WE VERY INTENTIONALLY TRYING TO GIVE A CITIES TO CONTINUE WITH ALREADY TO MAKE LOW ALL THIS TENDS. JENNIFER THE- I WANT I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THIS BUILT THE BUILDING TRADES LETTER TO MY CAR. YOU WERE MISTER HOW. THAT THE OBJECTS IS NOW. IS NOT ABOUT- TWO TO TEN UNITS WHICH IS WHAT THIS BILL POTENTIALLY ALLOWS IT'S A CONCERN THAT IN THE FUTURE A FUTURE BILL WILL EXTEND SB NO TO. A LARGER AMOUNT HIGHER THAN TEN UNITS WHICH IS STILL DOESN'T DO. AND WANTING PROTECTIONS. TEXANS RELATING TO THE FUTURE OF FOR- WE'RE GONNA TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WE CAN. I KNOW. BY THE FUTURE. NINE STILL BUT DISTILLING ON IS NOT TRIGGER THE CONCERNS THAT I'M READING IN THE BUILDING TRADES LETTER. MY COLLEAGUES ARE THIS IS A GOOD BILL BUT I THINK BALANCES. ARE FOR HOUSING. AND DIFFERS SIGNIFICANTLY TO CITIES TO MAKE LOCAL DECISIONS. THAT NEW ONE POWERFUL TOOLS I RESPECT US FOR I. OKAY OKAY WE THANK YOU SENATOR WIENER WE DO HAVE A MOTION ON SB NINE ALL TO IT WAS MOVED BY SENATOR ROTH SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS SENATE BILL NINE OH TWO BY SENATOR WINNER THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS WINNER BY WINNER I MORAL. MORRELL NOT VOTING. ZERO FIVE ZERO FIVE DORADO HI DORADO HIGH WIRE. MORE LOOK.

STILL THEY OPEN WITH THE EXCEPT HOUSING MEMONS. AND I ALSO TO ADDRESS CAN. THAT WERE RAISED- RECENTLY. I WILL BE AND I REALIZE IT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO THIS IN THIS COMMITTEE BUT- WILL DO IT IF IT MOVES ON TO A PROBES BUT I'M JUST MAKING MY VERBAL COMMITMENT TO DELETE SECTION KATE THREE BE- THEY'LL BE IN A ADDITIONAL SLIGHT FIX AND- CLEAR FOR CATION ON. THE OTHER WORDS WHERE WHERE I DISCUSS THE ISSUE OF. FEES INCLUSIONARY FEES THAT I WOULD JUST USE I WOULD JUST MOVE THE WORD AFFORDABLE TO THE SO THAT IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THE ONLY FEES THAT I AM TRYING TO INFLUENCE IN THIS BILL SO THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE COUNTED ON THE BONUS UNITS BECAUSE IT'S A DOUBLE COUNTING. ARE AFFORDABLE FEE SO I WOULD ON A- BEING CLEAR ABOUT WHAT. WOULD BE MOVING THAT WORD OF OR I'D BE INSERTING NETWORK AFFORDABLE SO IT'S CLEAR THAT IT'S AFFORDABLE. FEES IN LIEU IT CETERA ETCETERA. WITH THAT I WILL BONUS VERY IMPORTANT TOOL TO INCENTIVIZE MARKET RATE PROJECTS TO INCLUDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS. HOWEVER WHAT WE HAVE FOUND IN THE RESEARCH IS THAT LESS THAN ONE HALF OF ALL OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE APPROVED FRIDAY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE DENSITY BONUS NOW SOME OF THAT IS JUST YOU KNOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS A NOTE HOUSING. BUT SOME OF IT IS. THAT THERE'S BEEN IN DISTANCE SEE IN THE ADOPTION OF RULES BY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE UNNECESSARILY. THE BIT DENSITY BONUS LAW. IN ADDITIONALLY THE- THE BUILDERS HAVE JUST OPTED NOT TO YOUR LICENSE SO SINCE. THIS IS. TO INCREASE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE- STATUTE IS DESIGNED SO THAT IT ACTUALLY EXCEPT FOR THAT'S WHAT WE WANT. WE HAVE. ONE HERE. THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN CAL. FOR THE DAY TONY. HAND IF YOU. YOU LOOK AT THOSE THAT HAVE THE ROLE WITHIN ONE TO TWO PROUD TO PROVE IN. SO THIS GREAT TO. THAT WE REALLY WANT TO INCENTIVIZE MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITHIN THE MARKET RE PROJECTS IT'S NOT QUITE PULLING OFF WHAT WE HOPED. SO WHAT SB TEN EIGHTY FIVE DOES IS CLARIFY THAT THE STATE STATUTE AND LOCAL LAWS WILL COUNT THE NUMBER OF NUMBER OF AFFORDABLE UNITS REQUIRED IN THE SAME MANNER. IT ALSO- WELL IT IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL THAT WE NEED MORE HOUSING FOR LOW IN VERY LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. THE DENSITY BONUSES ALSO ALLOWS FOR THE IN MY OF A MODERATE INCOME A AM I OF 8210020% BUT WHAT WE FIND IS THAT IN OUR VERY HIGH HOUSING COSTS AREAS OF CALIFORNIA LIKE THE BAY AREA AND THE JOB RICH PARTS OF LA AND SAN DIEGO THE MIDDLE INCOME CAN NOT AFFORD HOUSING IN THE DENSITY BONUS NOT RESULTED IN ANY UNITS FOR THAT SEGMENT. SB EIGHTY FIVE DOES PROVIDE AN ADJUSTMENT FOR THE HIGH HOUSING COST AREAS THAT THEY COULD UTILIZE. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE UNITSFOR FAMILIES WITHIN THAT SO LASTLY THE TEN EIGHTY FIVE ALSO INCREASES THE UNIT BONUS FROM 35240% FOR. EVERYONE BELOW LOW. AND IT- ENCOURAGES THE D. B. THE DENSITY BONUS TO BE USED FOR STUDENT HOUSING PROJECTS BY ALLOWING THOSE STUDENT HOUSING PROJECTS THAT INCLUDE VERY LOW. INCOME AFFORDABLE UNITS TO UTILIZE AN ADDITIONAL INCENTIVE AND I THINK ALL OF US KNOW THAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST X. NUMBER OF YEARS A VERY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN HOMELESS STUDENTS IN STUDENTS WHO ARE HUNGER CHALLENGED INCREASING USE OF RELIANCE ON FOOD- NOR CAL. THIS PROGRAM. SO WE ARE FINDING MORE AND MORE STUDENTS IN NEED OF VERY AFFORDABLE UNITS FINALLY THIS BILL CONFORMS THE DENSITY BONUS APPROVAL WITH REQUIREMENTS IN OUR STATE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACTING WITH THAT'LL TURN MY WITNESSES DAVID GARCIA FROM THE TURNER CENTER AND CYNTHIA PARKER FROM BRIDGE SHOPPING THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTERS SKINNER AND FROM IS PARKER MISTER GARCIA. YOU WILL HAVE THREE MINUTES. TOTAL SO IF YOU WANT TO SPLIT IT NINETY SECONDS EACH JUST MAKE SURE TO TIME YOURSELVES YOU DON'T. CONSUME THE OTHERS SPEAKERS TIME- SO I WILL START WITH. OTHERS FIRST.

ALL WE CREATED ABOUT NINETEEN THOUSAND UNITS I HAVE ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND RESIDENTS LIVING IN OUR HOUSING ARE PORTABLE HELPING- WE HAVE ABOUT A BILLION FIND IN CONSTRUCTION RIGHT NOW ELEVEN THOUSAND UNITS IN OUR PIPELINE. SO WE'RE VERY SOON BEGAN TO THE NEED OR SHARP OF TOOLS IN OUR TOOL BOX IN ORDER TO CREATE. MORE HOUSING WE WANT TO REGISTER SUPPORT FOR THE BELT BECAUSE- WE DO NEED A TOOL IN PLACE.

OPPOSITION WE DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE SO MR ACOSTA YOU HAVE UP TO THREE MINUTES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BRIAN AUGUSTA ON BEHALF OF WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AND THE CALFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION- WE SHARED OUR CONCERNS WITH THE AUTHOR BUT MISTER CHAIRMAN I DON'T WANT TO DIRECT MY COMMENTS TO SOMETHING THAT MAY BE COMING OUT AND- MISSED. WHAT CENTER SKINNER. WAS IS REMOVING AND THE NEXT COMMITTEE SO IF WE COULD IF I COULD ASK FOR CLARIFICATION ON THAT. IS A PIECE OF THE BILL THAT SENATOR SANDERS AS LOU WAS COMING OUT. OKAY NORMALLY WHAT IT IS THAT IS THAT IF YOU WANT TO VERY QUICKLY SAY WHAT'S RIGHT NOW LIKE TO DO IS. I WOULD APPRECIATE IF THE OPPOSITION WOULD DESCRIBE THEIR OPPOSITION AND I WILL INDICATE A VARIETY OF THINGS IN MY CLOTHES OKAY SO YOU CAN PROCEED GIVE US SHERMAN HAS. YOUR TIME. I'M A- PART CONCERT. OR TWO FULL. ONE IS THAT. THE BILL- THAT IS IN PRINT. WOULD EXPAND THE DENSITY BONDS LAW TO COVER MODERATE INCOME HOUSING. TO ALLOW THE DENSITY BONUS TO BE USED. FOR UNITS THAT ARE AFFORDABLE. TO MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. WHICH WE THINK WILL RESULT IN. THE LOG BEING UTILIZED. IN A WAY THAT WILL. FINISH PRODUCTION OF HOUSING FOR LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. WE TAKE. WHAT WE SHOULD FOCUS OUR EFFORTS IS IN USING THIS IMPORTANT- LAW. THAT OVERRIDES LOCAL ZONING CONTROLS TO PROVIDE SOME INCENTIVES FOR THE PRODUCTION OF HOUSING TO FOCUS SAID WE'RE HOUSING PRODUCTION IS MOST NEEDED. AND IN MOST AREAS OF THE STATE THAT IS FOR THE PRODUCTION HOUSING FOR LOW AND VERY LOW. ALSO CONCERNED. WITH THE PROVISIONS WHICH WOULD EXPAND THE INCENTIVES FOR STUDENT HOUSING THAT IS A FAIRLY NEW PIECE OF THAT ANTI BONUS LAW. THE ECONOMICS OF THE STRUCTURE OF THOSE KINDS OF DEALS ARE MUCH DIFFERENT WE THINK OF THAT PERMITTED AND THEN EXISTING LAWS SHOULD BE GIVEN SOME ADDITIONAL TIME. TO WORK BEFORE WE START MAKING ADJUSTMENTS BUT IF WE ARE GOING TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO GIVE ADDITIONAL INCENTIVES FOR THE PRODUCTION OF THAT. FORM OF HOUSING WE SHOULD DO SO IN A WAY THAT ENSURES THAT WE GET GREATER AFFORDABILITY THERE ARE MANY STUDENTS. WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND HOUSING THEY CAN AFFORD IT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MAXIMIZING THE PRODUCTION OF UNITS. FOR THAT POPULATION AND GIVING AWAY INCIDENTS WITHOUT INCREASING. THE AFFORDABILITY DOES NOT DO THAT SO FOR THOSE REASONS. WE HAVE AN APOSTLE AS AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL AND WE HOPE TO CONTINUE THOSE DISCUSSIONS. AS THE BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR SERVICE- ON IS THERE ARE I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER COMMENTERS IN THE GALLERY SO MOVED TO TWENTY FORTY.

AND THERE ARE NO MORE IN OPPOSITION OKAY I THINK YOU'RE WRONG WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE COLLEAGUES ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. A CENTER CABALLERO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AND DIE I WANNA COMMENDED THE AUTHOR FOR THIS BILL- THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT DENSITY BONUS LIES ONE OF THE- PREMIER WAYS THAT WE CAN GET- AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS BUILT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I JUST WANNA. BE ONE NOTE OF CAUTION AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS ON. A WORK IN PROGRESS FORGET IT THERE'S A WAYS TO GET IT I THINK TO WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE BUT- THERE ARE MANY COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING. VERY DILIGENTLY. WITH THE DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR INCLUSIONARY HOUSING HOUSING WORD AND ORDINANCES AS ROBUST AS POSSIBLE AND THAT IT CAN. REALLY MEET THE NEEDS OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. AND SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T BàN WIPE THAT OFF. THE FACE OF THE EARTH IN ADOPTING A NEW DENSITY BONUS LAW. AND IN PARTICULAR THE ISSUE IS- THE. CHANGE THIS PROPOSED IN THIS BILL WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE DAY THAT THE DENSITY BONUS TO SATISFY ALL OF THE LOCAL REQUIREMENTS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING- IN MY REGION IF YOU ELECT TO USE THE DENSITY BONUS AND THEN HAVE TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING AS PART OF THAT DENSITY BONUS IT HASN'T NECESSARILY MEET THE REQUIREMENT. FOR THE LOCAL JURIST AND THAT THE DENSITY BONUS ARE THAT EXCUSE ME THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING INCLUSIONARY HOUSING ORDINANCE THAT THE LOCAL JURISDICTION HAS PASSED SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THAT FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT THIS. THAT I'VE LOOKED AT. THE. THE DENSITY LEVELS FOR VERY LOW LOW MODERATE AND- ABOVE THAT THAT WERE NOT BEEN COMING IN INTERNET AND TRANSFERRING OUR OWN IDEA OF WHAT SHOULD WORK IN THE COMMUNITY. THANK YOU SENATOR DROSS OF. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I KNOW- MY COLLEAGUES CENTER SKINNER WORKS- VERY VERY HARD ON THESE ISSUES- BUT I DO HAVE TO RAISE THE ISSUE- ABOUT THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ART PIECE OF IT. WE ALL KNOW THAT THE SHORTAGE IN LOW VERY LOW AN EXTREMELY LOW- HOW INCOME HOUSING IS JUST AT A BIGGEST OUR BIGGEST CRISIS LEVEL. WHEN THE HUNT ONE FOUR MILLION AFFORDABLE HOMES ARE NEEDED- AND SO- THIS ISSUE OF INCENTIVIZE THE BUILDING MODERATE INCOME HOUSING WHEN THE HIGHEST NEED ISN'T LOW INCOME HOUSING I THINK IS AN ISSUE OF EQUITY- SO I WONDER RAISE THAT TO THE TO THE AUTHOR- AND SECOND ONE TWO I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU'RE- WORKING ON UP ON. IS THAT HOW DEVELOPMENT CAN COULD BYPASS LABOR STANDARDS SO- THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THIRDS GONNA REALLY LIKE TO RESPOND THE. REMAIN CLOSER TO REFER- I'M HAPPY TO DO SO MY IN MY CLOTHES IF THERE'S ANY OTHER COMMENTS. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FEDERAL ACCOUNTS HERE. I AGENCIES I GUESS A CLARIFICATION- I'M READING ON PAGE TWO OF THE ANALYSIS IF YOU. WERE LOOKING AT BEDROOMS TO DETERMINE HOW MANY PARKING SPACES PEOPLE. YOU ARE REQUIRED WITH THE AFFORDABLE UNITS AND THEN IF YOU HAVE A 100% AFFORDABLE AND WITHIN A HALF MILE TRANSIT YOU GET A HALF UNIT I HAVE SPACE PER ACRE. WHAT WAS HIS I GUESS WHO WHY DO WE NEED TO GET TO A 100% AFFORDABLE IF WE'RE AT 80% THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE THE SAME INCENTIVES- SAME. OF A VALUE OF HAVING LESS PARKING AND LESS NEED FOR PARKING AND PERHAPS MORE UNITS BUILT. EARN DOES SENATOR MINERALS I CAN ADDRESS THAT AND THEN ALSO DO MY CLOTHES WHAT WHICHEVER YOU PREFER OKAY OKAY AND AGAIN IN A FINALLY AND IT'S ON THE OPPOSITION I GUESS DEPOSITION SEEMS TO INDICATE AND PUTTING ASIDE THE STUDENT HOUSING THIS IS THAT. PEOPLE NOT WITHSTANDING THE HOUSING ELEMENT OR HOUSING- THE RENO NUMBERS REQUIRING PEOPLE TO BUILD VERY LOW AN EXTREMELY LOW HOUSING THERE. THE MAGES BUILD MODERATELY LOW HOUSING GIVEN THE ECONOMICS SO HI SURE CONCERNED WITH AND I'M WILLING TO OBVIOUSLY TO WORK IN PROGRESS AND- WE'RE HAVING A SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS DAVID THAT SEEMS TO BE A LEGITIMATE ISSUE. WITH MISTER CHAIR FOR THE OKAY OFFERED TO ANSWER WILL HOLD UP FOR THE CLOTHES IF THAT'S OKAY CENTER NINETY ONE RESPOND NOW. WHAT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS MEMBERS. OKAY ODD SEEING NINE- AND IS THERE A MOTION ON THIS. ON THE WAY OKAY- AND BEFORE YOU CLOSE THE MOTION IS TO SEND THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE AS AMENDED- CENTER SKINNER YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU THERE WERE A NUMBER OF ISSUES REYES RONA SO- SO- LET'S SEE. OF TRADER ADDRESS THEM ALL- ANDI ISSUE OF THE- I BELIEVE SENATOR DRAWS ARE RAISED AROUND. WHO MY BRAIN ISN'T WORKING- THE SECOND PART- AT THAT IS ONE OF THE MEMBERS ON TAKING. OKAYSO APOLOGIES HEIGHTENS IT NOW IN THE ISSUE OF. THIS BILL DOES NOT REDUCE THE REQUIREMENT FOR EITHER VERY LOW INCOME OR LOW INCOME AFFORDABLE UNITS WHAT IT DOES IS ALLOW FOR IN THE HIGH COST AREAS A POTENTIAL EXPANSION OF WHAT'S CONSIDERED A MODERATE INCOME NOW OBVIOUSLY THERE IS SOME. DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER THAT'S NECESSARY OR NOT- AND WHAT. THE REASON IT'S INCLUDED IS BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE IN THESE HIGH COST AREAS WHO CANNOT AFFORD HOUSING. AND WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS THAT WHILE WE WHILE WE ADOPTED AND DESIGNED TO THIS DENSITY BONUS LAW TO TRY FOR THE INTENTION OF INCREASING AFFORDABLE UNITS. WE HAVE NOT SEEN THAT NUMBER WE'VE NOT SEEN THE READ THE NUMBER OF UNITS THAT WE HOPED SO IN THE REALLY HIGH COST AREAS WE ARE SEEING MUCH LESS TAKE UP. OF THE PROVISION OF THE REALLY AFFORDABLE BECAUSE THE ECONOMICS OF THE BUILDING COSTS THE PROPERTY COSTS THE LABOR COSTS THIS OTHER FEES THAT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT PUT TO ALL THOSE THINKS THE WHOLE NUMBER. JUST MAKES THE PER UNIT COST SO EXPENSIVE THAT THE BUILDERS ARE NOT OPTING IN OBVIOUSLY BUILDERS IFTHE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AS SOON CERTAIN WAY THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO BUILD IT'S REALLY ELECTIVE ON THEM AS TO WHETHER THEY UTILIZE STUDENT THE BILL. SO TURN TO IS MOTIVATE THEM TO UTILIZE IT MORE AND BECAUSE WE KNOW THERE IS THIS. NEAT FOR OUR HOUSE FOR EXAMPLE I. THE SOFT SERVICE TYPE A WORKER THAT IN A LOT OF THEORIES OF OUR STATE JUST CANNOT AFFORD HOUSING SO BUT THERE'S THIS YOU I AM NOT TRYING TO DILUTE THE VERY LOW FOR THE LOW INCOME ASPECT AND SO IT'S JUST ONE OF THESE. WED KNIVES AND DEBATES BEYOND. I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT WELL IT'S NOT BEFORE US ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ IS CARRYING A BILL THAT WOULD GREATLY INCREASE THE REQUIREMENT UNDER THE DENSITY BONUS LAW FOR THE VERY AFFORDABLE. AND I COMPLETELY SUPPORT THOSE PROVISIONS AND I WOULD HAVE INCLUDED THOSE PROVISIONS BUT I DID NOT WANT TO JUST DUPLICATE. HER LAW. AND SO I SEE THEM AS VERY MUCH COMPLIMENTARY AT SOME POINT WE MAY HAVE TO MERGE THEM- BUT I SEE THEM AS VERY CALM MEANT THREE AM VERY MUCH SUPPORTER LAW. THERE ARE THINGS IN THE BILL IN TEN EIGHTY FIVE THAT ARE NOT IN HERS. ONE FOUR X. THE ISSUE AROUND. WITH THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT AND VARIOUS OTHER THINGS. AND SO THAT IS WHY BY CONTINUED WITH MY BILL NOW. I AM OPEN AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE PROCESS TO ADDRESS THIS MODERATE INCOME THING BECAUSE MY POINT IS NOT TO DISCOURAGE OR ELIMINATE THE USE OF THE DENSITY BONUS FOR VERY AFFORDABLE UNITS IT IS. SO WELL. THERE WILL BE AN ONGOING CONVERSATION THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO THE STUDENT HOUSING. I CERTAINLY AM WILLING TO LOOK AT HOW WE CAN INCREASE THE VERY AFFORDABILITY BECAUSE MY WHOLE INTENT OF INCLUDING STUDENT HOUSING IN THIS BILL WAS BECAUSE OF THE NAME OF THE NEW REAL NEAT THAT THE WAR FINDING WAS STUDENTS WHERE THEY CAN. AFFORD EVEN DORMS SO I CERTAINLY- WE CAN RE LOOK AT THAT LANGUAGE AND SEE WHAT IMPROVEMENTS WE CAN MAKE. AND THAT TOO SENATOR COVERS POINT. HI I THINK ANY AND WE WILL RE LOOK AT IT BUT- THE- THE BILL AS WRITTEN DOES NOT ELIMINATE LOCAL ORDINANCES IT'LL IT THERE SOME CONFORMITY FIXES BUT THEY CAN STILL ADOPT ORDINANCES THAT ARE MORE LIBERAL. SO AGAIN WE AND IF YOU IF YOU WANT YOUR STAFF OR THE ENTITY THAT RACE THAT WE CAN SIT DOWN WITH MY STAFF AND GO THROUGH AND MAKE SURE. THAT I HAVE- THAT IT IS DOING WHAT I INTEND AND IS NOT DOING WHAT TIME YOU DESCRIBE THAT WOULD. HE FINALLY. ON THE ISSUE OF THE CHANGE IN THE PARKING. THE YEAH AND THOSE YOU KNOW TO ME THAT PART IS RELATIVELY MINIMAL ARE NOT MINIMAL BUT NOT ESSENTIAL TO WHAT I'M TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH IN THE BILL AND IF IT REALLY GIVES PEOPLE A LOT OF HEADACHE I COULD LET GO OF IT BUT IT WAS ONE OF THOSE WHERE. WORKED MY WHOLE PURPOSE IS TO JUST TRY TO IMPROVE. IMPROVE AND INCREASE THE USE I WANT THE DENSITY BONUS LAW TO BE USE SO THAT'S THE POINT OF IT AND WE BASED THIS VERY MUCH ON THE RESEARCH REPORT THAT THE BERNICE TURNER CENTER DID. AND I CERTAIN OPEN THREE VISIONS AS IT MOVES THROUGH BUT I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO GET AT THE CORE ELEMENTS OF IT THAT ARE GOING TO BUY BASED ON THE RESEARCH INCREASE THE USE OF THE TOOL BUT I CERTAINLY WILL RE LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE IN THE MODERATE PART TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS NOT. UNDERMINE THE TOOLS USE FOR AFFORDABLE UNITS IN WITH ACT I HOPE THAT YOU I WILL RECEIVE YOUR ACT OF. THANK YOU OUR MOTION. WILL CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS SENATE BILL TEN EIGHTY FIVE BY SENATOR SKINNER THE MOTION IS DO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS SENATOR WINNER HI WINNER I'D MORALE.

ALL THE SERVICES ARE THAT ARE NEEDED TO BUILD INTO THE LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO- MAKE TO SUPPORT THE HABITATION OF THESE HOMES AND THEIR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. WE SEE SB TWELVE NINETY NINE IS THE RESPONSE TO WHAT. HE CONCERNS ALONG WITH OTHER BILLS THAT SEVEN NINETY FIVE AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD.

SEVERAL WHAT CAN AFFECTIONATELY CALLED BEAT UP SHOPPING CENTERS THEY HAVE KARATE SCHOOLS IN THEM AND METRO. AB P. METRO A TELEPHONE SERVICES. THERE'S IT SEEMS LIKE A VERY NARROW LIMITATION ON SOME EXTREMELY DISTRESSED PROPERTIES VERSUS PROPERTIES THAT ARE GOING DOWN OR WE KNOW WE GO DOWN I'M WONDERING IF I HAVE TO BENEFIT THE AUTHORS- THOUGHTS ON THAT. SHE YES CENTER PORTANTINO SURE- WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS GO AFTER PROPERTIES THAT. OUR I CAN WRITE FOR THIS PROPOSAL WITHOUT CREATING AN INCENTIVE FOR OTHER BUSINESSES TO CLOSE SO AS FAR AS THE DEFINITION OF WHAT SHOULD QUALIFY I'M OPEN TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THAT WERE JUST WE WANT TO CREATED A DISINCENTIVE FOR. COMMERCIAL SPACE BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN COMMERCIAL SPACE CAN GO TO HOUSING BY RIGHT TO MEET THE DEMAND OF OUR HOUSING NEEDS SO THAT'S THE SWEET SPOT WE'RE TRYING TO HIT. SO WITH A LOOK AT. HOW WE DEFINE THAT TO. GOING FORWARD BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S THE THAT'S THE GOAL IS NOT TO NOT TO CLOSE RETAIL BUT% TO USE. CLOSED AND DISTRESS RETAIL FOR HOUSING. I HATE. THROUGH THE CHAIR IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THAT THE SHOPPING CENTER CONCEPTS. IDEA HAS COME AND GONE- THAT'S RIGHT THANK THE IDEA OF USING SOME OF THE SHOPPING CENTERS THAT THAT ARE EVEN DO WELL. ADDING HOW TO THEM ON THE SITE IS AN ATTRACTIVE OPPORTUNITY FOR MANY PEOPLE WHO. HAVE AFFECTIONATELY LOVE RETAIL AND HAVE THAT THAT MAKES USE COMPONENT IN THERE NOT TO DO AWAY WITH THE- WITH THE- COMMERCIAL SHOPPING CENTER I REALIZE THAT SOME OF THESE AREAS ARE DEAD THERE FROM THE OVER. YOU KNOW THE PLANNING HAS BEEN SOMETHING TO BE DESIRED ON THE STRIP MALL. REPLACE BUT THERE. ARE HERE THAT I'D LIKE TO SEE THE DEFINITIONS EXPAND IT'S A LEASE SOME OF THESE OTHER.

US WHAT WHATEVER IT IS THAT'S BEEN SITTING OUT THERE IN THESE HUGE HUGE PIECES OF LAND- SO I THINK THAT'S A- IT'S A GREAT IDEA BEHIND THIS BEHIND THIS BILL I WANT TO RAISE THE ISSUE OF- THAT IT WOULD BE HOUSING FOR THOSE IN THE EIGHTY TO A 120% AREA MEDIAN INCOME LEVEL AND I KNOW SOMEWHERE SOMEHOW- THAT'S BEEN THAT'S WHAT DEFINES WORKFORCE ALL OF HOUSING. I KNOW WORKING FAMILIES THAT MAKE LESS THAN WORK FORCE AND THEY THEY SACRIFICE A LOT AND THEY WORK HARD FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND- THEY NEED TO HAVE THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM AS WELL SO. I JUST WOULDLIKE THE I WOULD LIKE THE AUTHOR TO THINK MORE ABOUT HOW DO WE INCENTIVIZE OF WORKING FAMILIES IN THE WORK FORCE THAT ARE BELOW THE EIGHTY PERCENT- AM MINE THAT'S THE FIRST ONE AND THE SECOND ONE IS- IS ALSO WHAT I RAISED IN THE PREVIOUS.

ATTY TO PROVIDE THE TAX REBATE- WHEN THESE PROJECTS TO REZONE SO. I JUST WANNA KNOW WHERE THAT MIGHT BE COMING FROM ARE WE GIVING SOME FALSE HOPE PERHAPS TO DISABILITIES. THE BONTA HANDLE THAT MY CLOTHES AS WELL- WILL HANDLE IT IS CLOSE TO RESPOND TO. WELL YOU KNOW IF IT REQUIRES SOME KIND OF INCOME OR A TAX EXPENDITURE WILL GO TO APPROPRIATIONS I BELIEVE THIS IS KEY FISCAL SO WE WILL GO TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE AND WE KNOW HOW DIFFICULT THE CHAIRMAN OF THAT COMMITTEE IS SO THAT'S WHY I WANT TO ASK SOME QUESTIONS BUT ALL ALL WE- THANK YOU MISTER. ENTER ANY AND ALL CENTER ROTH. SEN OKAY CENTER OFFICE WITH THE BILL CENTER CABALLERO.

OF WORKERS- YOU KNOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN THERE SHOULD SHOULD BE FURTHER OUR EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE COMPLETE PICTURE AND HOPEFULLY THIS WILL COMPLEMENT THE PERSONAL CERTAINLY LOOK AT. ALL OF THE BILLS IN. IN CONCERT AS THEY MOVE. THROUGH THE SYSTEM TO SEE WHERE WHERE THEY NEED TO BE CHANGED AND ADAPTED THE SAME GOES FOR THE LABOR ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED SO FRANKLY WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE HELPFUL TO THE PROCESS HAD THEY COME FORWARD IN THE LAST- SEVERAL MONTHS TO HAVE SOME OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS VERSUS A SHOW UP BUT HEY- I'M- HERE THAT THE MORE YOU TALK THE BETTER THE OP. ONE OF THE INTEREST SERVED WHEN THINGS BROUGHT FORWARD. AS AS THE PHYSICAL COMPONENT YES- MY COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY HAS RAISED THE- AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND WE WILL BE LOOKING AT. HOW THIS GETS FUNDED MOVING FORWARD AND WHETHER IT FITS INTO SOME OF THE ECONOMIC- REDEVELOPMENT- ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PACKAGES THAT ARE MOVING TO THE LEGISLATURE AND- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY IT'S ARE IN AND- TO. NOT PUT SOMETHING OUT THERE- TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT TO PUTS BUT TO PUT SOMETHING OUT THERE THAT ACTUALLY. HAD SET. AND BILLS THE- BILLS HOUSING AND I WOULD ASK MY COLLEAGUES TO. MAYBE FURTHER WITH MIKE MY OFFICE AS WEL AS HOW THE TIMING OF THAT IMPLICATE IMPLEMENTATION OCCURRED AND WHAT FISCAL YEAR WE WOULD BE SEEING THE HEAD BECAUSE OR SOME ARGUMENTS THAT BY THE TIME YOU DO THE ENCUMBRANCES AND THE CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY IT WOULDN'T BE THIS FISCAL YEAR SO WE REALLY NEED TO PLAN IT OUT A LOT FIND IT WILL BE ADDRESSING THOSE SEVEN.
