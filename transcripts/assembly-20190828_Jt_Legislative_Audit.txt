D. REPRESENTS OVER THREE MILLION PEOPLE ACROSS EIGHTEEN. CITIES IT'S THE ONLY GOVERNING BOARD OF A LARGE METROPOLITAN AREA CALIFORNIA THAT IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS EXCLUDING LOCAL CITIES FROM HAVING A SEAT ON THE BOARD. THE ONLY OTHER COUNTY AIR DISTRICTS ARE GOVERNOR SIMILE ARE SMALLER PRIMARILY RULE COUNTIES WITH FAR FEWER AIR POLLUTION SOURCES I SUCH THAT FINANCES OFFICIAL ACTIONS ACTIVITIES OF THE SAN DIEGO AT CD ARE FULLY EMBEDDED WITHIN THE OPERATIONS OF THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO AND THEREFORE DIFFICULT TO EXTRACT AND EXAMINE. THE CITY TO A PC IS CURRENTLY THE CURRENT STUCTURE IN MY JUDGMENT DOES NOT REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF OUR SECURITIES RESIDENTS IS ANTIQUATED IT LEAVES OUT VALUABLE PERSPECTIVE AND INSIGHT TO LOCAL AIR POLLUTION SOURCES THAT CITIES AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS MAY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE. IT EVER IN AN EFFORT TO ADDRESS THIS AS WELL AS THE NEED FOR CITY WAS QUITE IMPROVE THE NEED TO IMPROVE AIR QUALITY INCREASE DIVERSITY ON THE BOARD OF AUTHORED ASSEMBLY BILL FOUR TWENTY THREE WHICH SEEKS TO RESTRUCTURE THE SAN DIEGO AT CITY BORDER MANNER THEY WERE CLOSELY MATCHES OF OUR BY OUR ARE SIMILARLY SIZED CITY CALIFORNIA AREAS. THIS NEW BOARD SHOULD HAVE COMPLETE INFORMATION REGARDING SEND YOU A PCD TO CONSIDER WELL AS THEY ASSUME THESE RESPONSIBILITIES SHOULD THE BILL BE SIGNED INTO LAW THIS AUDIT WILL HELP ANSWER QUESTIONS ON THE BOARDS FINANCIAL INFORMATION PROGRAM ACTIVITIES AS IT RELATES TO ITS FINANCES. AND ON ITS DECISION MAKING PROCESS SEES. IF A P. C. F. ASSEMBLY BILL FOUR TWENTY THREE DOES NOT PASS IT IS STILL IMPORTANT. FOUR EIGHT THAT CITY WAS A PC'S INFORMATION BE SEPARATE FROM THE COUNTY THIS BUDGET IN ORDER TO BETTER AND THAT WHILE THE PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND THE FINANCIAL AND PROGRAMMATIC FUNCTION. OF THIS KEY PUBLIC AGENCY. INCREASING IN A MAINTAINING TRANSPARENCY IN THIS REGARD AS CRUCIAL TO UP HOLDING A PUBLIC A PALO ACCOUNTABILITY. AS WE CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THE SERIOUS AIR POLLUTION ISSUES IN THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY AREA WITH ME THIS MORNING TO TESTIFIED SUPPORTERS DÃ¢N TALK FOR IN. WITHIN BY THE HEALTH COALITION. GOOD MORNING. PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM DIANNE TECH FOR IN AN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH COALITION. I ALSO SERVE ON THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD AS THE FIRST ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE REPRESENTATIVE ON THE BOARD. WE ARE IN NEARLY FORTY YEAR OLD ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATION WE WORK IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AND OUR COMMUNITY SUFFER FROM SOME OF THE WORST AIR POLLUTION IN. THAT COUNTY AND WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF WORKING TO REDUCE AIR POLLUTION AND PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH. BEFORE THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WHICH ALSO SERVES AS THE COUNTY'S AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT. WE ARE PLEASED TO SEE A COSPONSOR A BEFORE TWO THREE BY MR GLORIA WHICH WILL REFORM THE SAN DIEGO AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT TO UPDATE IT TO BE GOVERNED. BY AS LARGE DISTRICTS ARE IN THE STATE BY A DIVERSE AND REPRESENTATIVE BOARD. BUT ON THIS PATH TOWARDS MODERNIZATION THAT A. B. FOR TWENTY THREE HAS CREATED. THERE'S A CRITICAL NEED FOR AN AUDIT OF THE CURRENT OPERATIONS OF THE SAN DIEGO AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT THIS IS BECOME VERY CLEAR. SPECIFICALLY WE ARE REQUESTING THAT THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE CONDUCT AN AUDIT OF THE A PC DE. AN EFFORT TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AND ENSURE THAT SAN DIEGO CAN HAVE THE CLEANEST ARE POSSIBLE. LOOKING UP AT A FEW EXAMPLES FIRST AT THE A. B. C. D. BUDGET THE SEVENTY THREE MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET IS INCLUDED IN THE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PAGE COUNTY BUDGET. AS ONLY ONE PAGE WITH SIX EXPENDITURE LINE ITEMS. AS AN EXAMPLE ONE LINE ITEM OTHER CHARTERS WAS BUDGETED FOR TWENTY NINE MILLION IN THIS FISCAL. GIVEN THAT IS NEARLY HALF OF THE A. B. C. DEEP BUDGET MORE DETAIL IS CLEARLY REQUIRED. TO ENABLE THE PUBLIC TO BE FULLY INFORMED AND TO UNDERSTAND THE FUNCTIONING OF THIS AGENCY. ACTUALLY SINCE THIS AUDIT REQUEST WAS MADE THERE HAS BEEN MORE DETAIL THAT'S BEEN ADDED TO THE COUNTY NARRATIVE AND SO WE THINK THAT THAT'S A GOOD SIGN. MOVING TOWARD FURTHER TRANSPARENCY THAT THIS AUDIT WILL BUY. ANOTHER EXAMPLE REAL TO A PLEASE PLEASE CALL ME. AND THEIR EFFECTIVENESS. LASTLY I'D SAY THAT ABCD IS ORGANIZATIONALLY PART OF THE COUNTY'S LAND USE AND ENVIRONMENT GROUP. IT APPEARS THAT A P. C. D. STAFF PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR ACTIVITIES WITHIN THIS UNIT THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE RELATED TO A P. C. D. STATED MISSION IN AND FULFILLMENT OF THEIR REGULATORY AND STATUTORY. RESPONSIBILITIES LEGITIMATE PUBLIC QUESTIONS RELATED TO THESE ACTIVITIES THAT I THINK COULD BE ANSWERED BY THE AUDIT. OUR OUR THESE SERVICES PAID FOR THAT BY THE COUNTY OR BY ANOTHER FUNDING SOURCE DO THESE SERVICES DETRACT FROM FULFILLMENT OF EIGHT CITIES MISSION. I HAVE NO DOUBT. AT THE CAPABLE AND COMMITTED STAFF OF A. B. C. D. ARE COMMITTED TO TAKING BOLD AND EFFECTIVE ACTION TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF A BEFORE TWO THREE THERE'S BEEN A RIP ROBUST AND COLLABORATIVE DISCUSSION AT THAT HAS EMERGED WITH CLEAR IMPROVEMENTS AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS AUDIT WILL FURTHER THAT THAT EFFORT SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AT THIS TIME WILL MOVE TO THE STATE AFTER PLEASE THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. ASSEMBLYMEMBER GLORIA'S ASKED US OBVIOUSLY TO LOOK AT THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT IN SAN DIEGO FIRST OBJECTIVE IS REALLY LOOKING AT THEIR PROCEDURES THEIR PROCESSES FOR DECISION MAKING WITH RESPECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL DECISIONS PUBLIC HEALTH DECISIONS. HE'S ASKING US TO LOOK AT A FOUR YEAR WINDOW NOT ONLY FOR THAT BUT FOR OTHER. OBJECTIVES IN THE IN THE AUDIT REQUEST SPECIFICALLY ASKING US TO LOOK AT THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUDGET. AND REALLY TRYING TO DRILL DOWN AND LOOK AT REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES RELATED TO AIR POLLUTION CONTRO DISTRICT FUNCTIONS INSPECTIONS ENFORCEMENT. AMOUNTS PAID FOR EQUIPMENT ETCETERA PERMIT FEE REVENUE SO REALLY TRYING TO DRILL DOWN INTO INTO THAT INFORMATION GETTING A HANDLE ON IT OVER A FOUR YEAR WINDOW FOR FISCAL YEARS. IN ADDITION TO THAT LOOKING AT STAFFING LOOKING AT WORK. ON THE TIME THAT STAFF ARE SPENDING EITHER ON AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT FUNCTIONS OR ARE SOME OF THOSE STAFF PERFORMING. A WRIST PERFORMING DUTIES OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF WHAT THE DISTRICT A STAFFER SUPPOSED TO BE DOING SO MAKING SURE THAT STAFF ARE. ARE INVESTING THEIR TIME IN EFFORTS RELATED TO AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT FUNCTIONS. IN ADDITION HE HAS ASKED US TO LOOK AT THE BUDGETING PROCESS SO HOW DOES THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT PUT TOGETHER THEIR PIECE OF. THE COUNTY'S BUDGET TO BE ROLLED UP INTO THE INTO THE BIGGER BUDGET AND AGAIN LOOKING AT A FOUR YEAR WINDOW. THE LAST TWO OBJECTIVES REALLY FOCUS ON GRANTS HAVE THERE BEEN ANY GRANTS AWARDED TO THE DISTRICT. HOW HOW MUCH ARE THOSE GRANTS FOR. AND HAS THE DISTRICT COMPLIED WITH THE REQUIREMENTS IN THOSE GRANT GRANT. DOCUMENTS AND THEN THE LAST BIG ISSUE IS LOOKING AT OUT REACH HOW HAS THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT REACHED OUT TO THE COMMUNITY SOLICITED INPUT FROM THE COMMUNITY HE WANTS US TO COMPARE THAT TO IS COMPARABLE DISTRICTS WILL LOOK TO SEE DISTRICTS OF SIMILAR SIZE. PERHAPS SIMILAR CONSTRUCTION I'M NOT SURE IT SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BUT WHAT WILL UP FIGURE THAT OUT AS WE GO BUT HOW THE INFORMANT COMMUNITIES ASKING US ARE THEY ARE COMMUNICATING INFORMATION IN VARIOUS LANGUAGES SO THAT PEOPLE CAN BE ENGAGED IN THE VARIOUS PROCESSES. IF THERE ARE INCREASE FROM THE PUBLIC HOW ARE THEY RESPONDING TO THOSE IN CORY'S ARE THOSE RESPONSES TIMELY ARE THEY COMPLETE ETCETERA. AND THEN THE FINAL PIECE OF OUT REACH IS REALLY THEIR PUBLIC MEETINGS ARE THEY COMPLYING WITH OPEN MEETINGS LAWS SO A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT THINGS WITH RESPECT TO OUR REGION ENGAGING WITH THE COMMUNITY AND SAN DIEGO. ON THE BUDGET FOR THIS AUDIT ABOUT TWENTY SIX HUNDRED HOURS THAT WOULD TAKE ONE TEAM WE THINK ONE TEAM MAKES SENSE ON THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT ABOUT SIX MONTHS WITH THAT MISTER CHAIR I'LL ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS MEMBERS MAY HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AT THIS TIME WE TURN IT BACK OVER TO THE DYESS ME ASK IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS ON THE DÃ­AS. MR WARLOCK. PLEASE MAKE MIXTURE I'M- JUST CURIOUS. WE JUST HAD A- HEARING ON THE- GAMBLING COMMISSION AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE VERY GOOD. BUDGET DETAILS ON THEIR WEBSITE EITHER SO I'M- JUST SORT OF CURIOUS. THE CINNAMON. GLORIA DID YOU WORK WITH THE AUDITOR CONTROLLER FOR THE- COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO TO GET SOME OF THIS INFORMATION. WE ARE WORKING WITH THE COUNTY THAT THE THAT REPRESENTED IN THE AUDIENCE BUT AND THEY'VE BEEN GENERALLY OF GREAT TO WORK WITH AS DESTRUCTOID MENTION WHO ALREADY GETTING SOME ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON AS A RESULT OF OUR QUESTIONS. BUT THIS IS SIR TO PORTANTINO'S RELATES THAT LEGISLATION INTRODUCED AB FOR TWENTY THREE IF IT'S RATIFIED SIGNED INTO LAW THE NEW BOARD IT WOULD ASSUME THESE RESPONSIBILITIES I THINK WE OWE IT TO THEM TO GIVE THEM A FULL UNDERSTANDING AN ACCOUNTING OF HOW THE CITY TO A P. C. BOARD HAD. IT WORKS WHAT'S THE STATE'S FINANCES HOW IS THE OPERATION WORKING AS THEY SOON THEIR NEW DUTIES AGAIN IF THE BILL IS PASSED AND IF NOT I THINK TO YOUR QUESTION YOU'RE THE KIND OF TRANSPARENCY I THINK IT IS THAT IS A- INCOME UPON PUBLIC AGENCIES. THIS AUDIT WOULD HELP FOR THAT AND PERHAPS ALLOWED TO COUNTY TO BE MORE ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PUBLIC IS BEING THERE THAT THEY'RE REGULATING. BUT YOU HAVEN'T. PURSUED A PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST OR YOU HAVEN'T. WITH THE AUDITOR CONTROLLER JUST INDEPENDENT WE TRY TO GET SOME OF THIS INFORMATION IS THAT CORRECT I MYSELF HAVE NOT I KNOW OTHERS. I'M JUST. THE REASON I ASK IS WE PAY PRETTY AYE BILLING RATE. TO OUR AUDITORS AND SOME OF THAT STUFF MAYBE WE COULD SAVE SOME MONEY ON SITES. LET'S REASON FOR MY QUESTION THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF JUST SETTING THE STATE AUDITOR'S WORTH EVERY PENNY. WILL MOVE TO SENATOR BORDERS AND TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN YEAH I'M KIND OF FOLLOW ALONG THE SAME LINES THIS IS DESIGNED TO BEING. COMPLIMENTARY TO AB FOUR TWO THREE WHICH IS IN THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS RIGHT NOW. HAD YOU CONSIDERED MAYBE MAKING THIS AUDIT CONTINGENT UPON PASSAGE OF FOUR TO THREE I KNOW YOU PROVIDED RATIONALE FOR IN THE EVENT THAT FOR TWO THREE DOESN'T PASS. THE SENATE AND GET SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. TO RESTRUCTURE THE LOCAL AIRBOARD. I GUESS I'M SHOULD TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHERE IS THE COMPELLING NEED. BECAUSE TRANSPARENCY DOES IT NORMALLY TRIGGER AT LEAST IN MY OPINION COMPELLING NEED TO USE THE RESOURCES OF THE AUTHOR NORMALLY THERE'S A CONTROVERSY. AND QUESTIONS ABOUT PERFORMANCE AND HOW IN ENTITIES RELATES SELF WITH GOOD PRACTICE AND I JUST I JUST DON'T SEE. WHERE IS THE CONTROVERSY HERE. WELL THE LIMITED MANDATE LET ME HAVE A GO AT IT SO I WOULD JUST SAY THAT YOU KNOW THIS IS VERY MUCH OF SAN DIEGO ISSUE SIDE RESPECT AND UNDERSTAND IF THIS IS NOT A PART OF YOUR DAILY NEWS HABIT BUT I WOULD SAY THAT IT WHETHER IT IS A MANUFACTURER THAT'S PAYING A FEE FOR INTERFACE WITH A PCD BUT WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT FEE IS INCLUSIVE OF THINGS OUTSIDE OF THE OPERATIONS AS WAS MENTIONED I MISS TACK FOUR IN THE SUPPORTED ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS THAT ARE HARD TO SEE YOU KNOW THAT AND THAT WOULD. BE VERY COULD BE IN VIOLATION OF STATE LAW BUT THAT'S NOT YOUR JURISDICTION THAT WOULD BE THE PRIMACY OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THAT COMPRISES THE AIRBOARD WELL SENATOR YOU'RE ASKING FOR WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE NEED FOR THIS BILL WHAT I PROMISE AT EIGHTEEN POINT A LACK OF BUT WELL STATE LAW THAT I'M REFERRING TO WEBSITE IF THERE'S A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IN THE FEES AND IF WE KEEP IT WITH IF MISS HOUSE ARE ALLOWED TO DO HER WORK I THINK WE'LL BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER NOT THOSE FEES ARE PROPERLY PRICED. AND IF A MALE TO BE LOWER OR HIGHER BASED UPON THAT THIS IS A PART OF YOUR BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA AND SO I THINK THAT THAT'S WORTHWHILE BUT PROBABLY THE MAUVE ARCHING ISSUE IS THAT SAN DIEGO HAS THE SIX FORCED AIR QUALITY IN THE UNITED STATES AND THAT'S A MAJOR CONCERN THAT IS A SCANDAL WORTH LOOKING AT AND THIS IS THE AGENCY THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REGULATION OF THAT AND TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS DIFFERENT THAN ITS COMPETITOR UP AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICTS IN CALIFORNIA THIS IS THE NEED FOR THE BILL BUT THE CHANCE PARENTS WERE TALKING ABOUT I THINK IS IMPORTANT. LASTLY SIR THIS IS PUBLIC MONEY IN SO I WOULD CHALLENGE ANY MEMBER OF THIS BOARD WHETHER NOT YOU WANT TO SIGN UP FOR MAKING IT HARDER TO ASCERTAIN WHERE THIS MONEY IS GOING WHAT'S COMING FROM AND WHERE IT'S GOING ON THIS AUDIT WOULD WOULD CORRECT THAT AND THAT WOULD BE VALUABLE WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S INDEPENDENT A PCD WITH A CONTINUES TO BE HOUSED WITHIN THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO. WELL I BEING FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHICH HAS THE WORST AIR IN CALIFORNIA I HAVE. A SOFT SPOT FOR THIS TYPE OF ISSUE. I HAVEN'T SEEN FOR TWO THREE YET. I THINK IN THEORY THOUGH. I LIKE THE IDEA. OF INCLUDING. OTHER MUNICIPALITIES IN IMPACTED REGIONS. I THINK THAT IS A HEALTHY THING. I THINK IT. WAS A BUT I GUESS YOU KNOW ALL ALL IN MY COMMENTS HERE THAT. IF WE WERE LOOKING AT TRANSPARENCY AS BEST POLICY AND PRACTICE WROTE CALIFORNIA. WE WOULD OVERWHELM THE LIMITED RESOURCES THAT YOUR OFFICE HAS. AND SO WE HAVE TO BE CHOOSY AND DISCREET AND SELECTIVE. ABOUT WHERE WE MAKE THAT INVESTMENT AND WITHOUT CONTROVERSY IN MY OPINION. I JUST DON'T SEE THE COMPELLING NEED. THAT'S JUST MY PERSONAL HAS MEDITATE ENGINEER BY SENATOR. THAT THANK CENTER BORDERS AND YEAH AND THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY WE ACTUALLY DO INCLUDE ARE SMALL CITIES ON THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE THEIR VOICES HEARD AS WELL AND SO I SEE THAT YOUR REQUEST KIND OF IN ALIGNMENT WITH THAT. BRING THAT TRANSPARENCY AS WELL WITH THAT LET'S GO TO MOVE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL. I HAVE A COMMENTS AND SOME QUESTIONS MY VERY GOOD FRIEND FROM SAN DIEGO. GOOD FOR FROM CITY. AND SPEAKING OF SANTEE IT'S A SMALL MEDIUM SIZED CITY ALONG WITH EL CAJON OF MY DISTRICT NOW ONE OF THE PROBLEMS I HAVE WITH THIS AND- FOR TWENTY THREE. IS FOR MANY YEARS THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS I BELIEVE IN MY OPINION HAS DONE A VERY GOOD JOB. CONTROLLING AIR POLLUTION AND MONETARY. ONE OF THE WILD CARDS THAT. MAY NOT BE KNOWN TO THIS COMMITTEE IS TO A ONE OF MEXICO. WE GET A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF POLLUTION UNDER CONTROL ABSOLUTELY. SPEWING OUT OF THAT AREA DEPENDING UPON THE TIME OF YEAR AND JET STREAM EXCEPT FOR. SO. ONE THING NICE ABOUT THE CURRENT SET UP IS THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HAVE WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH TIJUANA TRYING TO DO WHATEVER THEY CAN DO TO HELP OUT THERE. SO. ANOTHER ISSUE WITH FOR TWENTY THREE AND HOW IT DOVETAILS INTO THIS REQUEST IS IF. THEY GO TO A DIFFERENT STRUCTURE. I'M ASSUMING WITH ALMOST 95% ASSUMPTION THAT IT WILL BENEFIT LARGE CITIES OVER THE SMALL CITIES UNDER THE CURRENT SANDBAGS SAN DIEGO ASSOCIATION OF. GOVERNMENTS IT'S A WAITED VOTE WHICH MEANS SAN DIEGO BASICALLY ALONG WITH THE COUNTY DOMINATES. I BELIEVE THIS WOULD BE A WAITED VOTE. ELIMINATING THE COUNTY TO SOME EXTENT SO WE GO FROM FAIR REPRESENTATION WITH FIVE COUNTY SUPERVISORS THAT ARE ELECTED FROM THEIR DISTRICTS SO YOU HAVE DIVERSITY THERE. AND SAN DIEGO POLITICALLY IS TURNING BLUE. A BLUE SO THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN FUTURE ELECTIONS ARE GOING TO BE TURNED OVER ANYWAY. SO TO ME THIS HOLD. AB FOR TWENTY THREE STRUCTURE. IS NOT NEEDED. ALSO. THE AUDIENCE IS REDUNDANT EIGHTY FOUR TWENTY THREE INCLUDES A REQUIREMENT FOR THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO COMPLETE A PROGRAM AUDIT. BY JUNE FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE OF THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL BOARD. THIS AUDIT WOULD BE DUPLICATIVE OF THOSE EFFORTS ALSO I BELIEVE THAT IF A SIMPLE REQUEST IS MADE THEY WOULD BE MORE THAN GLAD TO COMPLY. VOLUNTARILY OPENER BOOKS OPEN EVERYTHING SO. TO ME THIS IS OVERKILL WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO BE HIT THEM WHAT TO ORDER IT'S ESSENTIALLY. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME THERE. IN THIS REQUEST IS PREMATURE. WE'RE GONNA SPEND THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ON AN AUDIT. THAT WILL BE DONE BEFORE. AN AUDIT BY FOUR TWENTY THREE. IT'S ABSOLUTE OVER KILL. AND THAT'S BASICALLY MY COMMENTS I HAD A QUESTION BUT I'VE ANSWERED MY OWN MIND ALRIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU FOR YOUR STATEMENT WITH THAT LET ME ASK IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FOR MEMBERS ON THE DÃ­AS. HEARING AND SEEING NINE MISSED WORRY WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE SURE LET ME JUST TACKLE ONE QUESTION THAT. MY COLLEAGUE FOR SANTEE MENTION THERE IS A REQUEST OF FOR CARB TO PERFORM AN AUDIT OF ITS OWN THAT'S A PERFORMANCE AUDIT IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE'RE ASKING. IS HOW TO DO AND MISS TACKLING'S HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT IF YOU LIKE BUT I JUST WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR CONSIDERATION I NOTE THAT WE DO HAVE THE COUNTY IN THE AUDIENCE HERE TODAY AND I WANT TO EXPRESS MY PUBLICLY APPRECIATION. FOR THEIR COLLABORATIVE EFFORT IN WORKING ON THIS BILL YOU SEE THAT THEY'RE NOT OPPOSED TO THIS LEGISLATION I THINK THEY SEE IT AS A POSITIVE STEP FORWARD FOR US THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN SAN DIEGO A REGION. HOWEVER IT'S STILL A POINT TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE DO NOT YET KNOW THE COMPLETE SCOPE OF THE SITUATION AND THAT IS WHY THIS AUDIT IS SO VERY NECESSARY A TO INCREASE TRANSPORT TRANSPARENCY AND TO PROVIDE THE NEW BOARD. WITH ALL THE RELEVANT INFORMATION THAT IT MUST HAVE AS IT TAKES OF THE FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITIES ARE BRING A PUBLIC AGENCY IN THE COUNTY OF SAN. DIEGO IS FOR THAT REASON I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR EITHER. OKAY THANK RESTORE AT THIS TIME WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO AFFECTED AGENCIES IF WE HAVE ANY AFFECTED AGENCIES OF LIKE TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY. PLEASE THERE IS. THE MORNING SURE SOUNDS VICE CHAIR ROTH JONATHAN CLAY HERE ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY SAN DIEGO WE ARE NEUTRAL ON THIS AUDIT REQUEST WE UNDERSTAND THE DESIRE FOR HAVING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE OPERATIONS OF OUR AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT AND WE WELCOME THE REVIEW WE FEEL THAT WE'VE BEEN RUNNING THE PROGRAM WITH INTEGRITY AND PROVIDING BETTER AIR QUALITY FOR THE CITIZENS OR THE RESIDENTS OF SAN DIEGO AS BOTH THE SPONSORS AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA MENTIONED WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY CLAPPER LEAVE WITH SOME ON. THE DETAILS OF FOUR TWENTY THREE WHICH WOULD BASICALLY REMAKE THE COMPOSITION OF THE AIR DISTRICT TO INCLUDE CITIES AND OTHER CITIZENS WITH WITHIN THE COUNTY AND WITH THAT I'D WE'RE JUST HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU FOR SHARE THAT. ANY OTHER AFFECTED AGENCIES HEARING INSANE NINE WE ARE GOING TO MOVE ON TO PUBLIC COMMENT AS OR ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS AGENDA ITEM. GEN ITEM NUMBER FIVE. SYRIAN SAYING MAN. WE WILL MOVED TO VOTE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CLOTHES SOMEONE NUMBER GLORIA IT'S BEEN MOVED BY MISTER ROTH IT'S BEEN SECOND IN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO WITH THAT. MISTER SECRETARY CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO APPROVE ATER REQUEST NUMBER TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN DASH ONE TWENTY SEVEN SAN DIEGO AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA. ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALAS HI SOUTH HIGH EARNER WERE ABOUT. MAYES PATTERSON PATTERSON NOW. RUBIO RUBIO AYE VOEPEL. VOEPEL NOW WHAT. CENTER ROTH ROTH I ORDERS. GORGEOUS NOW GONZALEZ. GONZALEZ I HERTZBERG. MONNING MONNING AYE MORLOCK MOORLACH NOW WIENER WIENER AYE. WALLY THAT MOTION ON CALL. OKAY AT THIS TIME WE WILL MOVE TO AGENDA ITEM NUMBER THREE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK THIS IS TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN DASH ONE TWO ONE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE OVERSIGHT OF THE PET LOVERS SPECIALIZED LICENSE PLATE PROGRAM. MR QUIRK WHEN YOU'RE READY TO BEGIN. THANK YOU JUST JUST A MOMENT GOOD MORNING CHAIR SENATORS ASSEMBLY MEMBERS OUR AND THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT MY REQUEST TO HAVE THE STATE AUDITOR EXPLORE THE PET LOVERS SPECIALIZED LICENSE PLATE FONT. ALL I MAKE REQUESTING ON A TREE VIEW HOW THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN FUNCTIONING TO DATE WITH A FOCUS ON PROVIDING PUBLIC ASSURANCE. THAT THERE'S BEEN A FAIR PROCESS FOR AWARDING FUNDS. THE ITEMS OUTLINED IN THE COMMITTEE SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES STRIVE TO IDENTIFY THE VARIOUS ASPECTS OF HOW THE PROGRAM IS ADMINISTERED. A CURRENT STATEMENT OF FUNDS AVAILABLE AND WARRANTED AND THE PROCESS BY WHICH THESE FUNDS ARE DETERMINED. NOW I DID HAVE A VERY HELPFUL MEETING WITH THE DEPARTMENT YESTERDAY AND MANY OF MY QUESTIONS WERE ANSWERED. BUT THEY RAISE MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE WHOLE PROCESS. I WILL SAY THAT IN LOOKING AT THEY SHOWED ME WHAT THE AWARDS WERE THEY SEEM TO GO TO QUITE REPUTABLE ORGANIZATIONS THAT'S GOOD. BUT WE DO NOT KNOW FRANKLY ANYTHING ABOUT HOW THESE WERE DETERMINED EVEN NOW. OF MAJOR REASON FOR THIS IS THAT THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THAT MAKE THIS DISPOSITION OF FUNDS IS SECRET. AND FURTHER THEIR DELIBERATIONS ARE SECRET. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL. ALL OF YOU HAVE PROBABLY SERVED ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHERE YOU HAD APPOINTED GROUPS CITIZEN VOLUNTEERS WHO ARE MAKING DECISIONS WITH REGARD TO DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS FOR MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF GIVING AWAY OF FEDERAL MONEY DECIDING WHICH NONPROFIT TO WOULD GO TO A PROPER PROCESS MOST LIKE THIS. WITH LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY ALWAYS HAD PLENTY OF VOLUNTEERS ALWAYS HAD A PUBLIC PROCESS. AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS TO LOOK AT BECAUSE THE REASON WE WERE GIVEN FOR THIS IS WE DO THIS THROUGHOUT THE DEPARTMENT AT STANDARD FURTHER IT'S STANDARD THEY SAID IN MARCH OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT I REALLY THINK THIS HAS TO BE UNDERSTOOD EXTREMELY WELL IN IT HAS. RANMA IF THIS IS TRUE THAT THIS IS SOME STANDARD PROCEDURE THAT IS RAMIFICATIONS THROUGHOUT STATE GOVERNMENT SO THIS IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE AUDIT. A SECOND I DID GET AGAIN THE ANSWERS TO MOST OF MY QUESTIONS YESTERDAY BUT. THESE THINGS NEED TO BE AVAILABLE AND TO THE PUBLIC AND THERE SIMPLY WASN'T A GOOD PROCESS FOR THAT SO WE HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THEIR PROCESS SEES. THE THIRD POINT HERE IS THAT THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY CALLED FOR COLLABORATION. AND WHAT THIS COLLABORATION MEANS DOES IT MEAN THAT YOU EXCHANGE EMAILS AND WITH SOMEONE OR DOES IT MEAN THAT YOU TAKE NOTE OF WHAT THEY'RE SAYING. SO AGAIN TALKING ABOUT COLLABORATION I THINK THIS IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND AGAIN OF STATEWIDE ISSUE BECAUSE WE ARE ALL WAYS LOOKING FOR PUBLIC INPUT IN HOW WE DO THIS. SO I WOULD JUST SAY THAT. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT FOR THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM BUT I WOULD SAY PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO THE SECRECY OF HOW THE FUNDS ARE GIVEN. THAT IS I THINK SOMETHING THAT WOULD REALLY NEEDS TO BE TAKEN TO A VERY CAREFUL LOOK AT. SO I REQUEST BY RESPECTFULLY PRESS THE COMMITTEE APPROVE THIS WITH THE TIMING PRIORITIZATION SO THAT THE RESULTS MAY BE AVAILABLE SHOULD ADDITIONAL CLARIFYING LEGISLATION BE NEEDED NEXT YEAR. AND I THINK THAT WELL AGAIN WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT THE SECRECY OF HOW THESE FUNDS ARE GIVEN AND WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S. WITH ME TODAY IN SUPPORT THE IS JUDY MANN CRUCERO FOUNDER AND CEO AND PRESIDENT OF SOCIAL COMPASSIONATE LEGISLATION THE SPONSORING ORGANIZATION FOR THE PET LOVERS LICENSE PLATE. DR ANALLY FUSE ME ALLEN THREE C. DIRECTOR AND CHIEF VETERINARIAN FOR RIVERSIDE COUNTY ANIMAL SERVICES AND THEN I REALLY WANT TO THANK VERY MUCH OF BILL GATES FOR BEING HERE HE'S THE CHIEF CONSULTANT WITH SENATE BUSINESS AND- PROFESSIONS AND HE'S HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU. ADDRESS QUIRK WILL GO AHEAD IN ALLOW YOUR ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY. YES THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK SO GOOD MORNING I'M JUDY MAN CREW SO FROM LAGUNA BEACH CALIFORNIA I ACTUALLY HAVE THREE NON PROFITS AND ONE CAME UP OUT OF THIS. PROCESS THAT WE THAT DR DREW SEASON I STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT AND TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS A PET OVERPOPULATION CRISIS AND WE KILL HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ANIMALS IN OUR SHELTERS EVERY YEAR AND THESE ARE TAX PAYER DOLLARS SO IT'S A MORAL DEFICIT IT'S A FINANCIAL DEFICIT. AND SO ALLEN DR DREW SEASON I AND OTHERS AROUND THE STATE SAID WE NEED A FUNDING MECHANISM THAT IS NOT FROM THE GOVERNMENT BUT A PUBLIC PRIVATE PROGRAM THEY CAN BE A SUSTAINABLE FUNDING MECHANISM AND THAT THIS FUNDING MECHANISM BE 1100% TRANSPARENT. TO THE PUBLICTO THE GOVERNMENT TO EVERYBODY THAT PUTS MONEY IN IT SO THE FIRST THING WE DID IS WE WENT TO THE BMB AND WE APPROACH THEM TO DO A LICENSE PLATE PROGRAM THEY SAID YES. WELL A LICENSE PLATE PROGRAM HAD IT BEEN IN PLACE SINCE NINETEEN NINETY NINE BECAUSE OF A LAWSUIT. SO THEN WE WENT TO SENATOR PADILLA AT THAT TIME WHO THOUGHT HE NEEDED TO DO LEGISLATION TO HELP US BUT THEN THE DMV SAID NO. NO ALL THAT THIS NONPROFIT HAS TO DO IS THEY NEED A SPONSORING AGENCY THEY HAVE TO GET THEIR ARTWORK APPROVED AND PIERCE BROSNAN WHO IS A FRIEND DID THE ARTWORK FAR US THIS IS HIS CAT ANGEL BABY AND NOT SHILOH. AND HE HAS GIVEN US THAT OUR WORK IN PERPETUITY FOR THE PLATE TO MY TO OUR NINE ARE NONPROFIT. AND THE THIRD THING THAT WE HAD TO DO WAS ACCUMULATES. SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED PRE ORDERS THAT THEN WE WOULD TURN ALL. ALL THIS OVER TO THE DMV SO ONE OF MY BOARD MEMBERS DR GARY MICHAEL SAN PUT IN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR US TO START. MARKETING MEANING ON THE WORD OUT. TO MY WITNESS. I DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARY TO GO TO THE HISTORY OF ALL OF THIS. I THINK YOU WOULD BE I THINK THE COMMITTEE WOULD BE BETTER SERVED IF YOU SIMPLY TALKED ABOUT YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH CDFA. ANTIOCH RESIDENTS OKAY I THINK YES IN THE CHAIR APPROVALS. OKAY THANK OKAY THEN I'LL FLY FORWARD SO WE GAVE THE FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AND AT THAT TIME WE WERE RECEIVING REPORTS ON HOW MUCH MONEY WAS IN HOW MANY PLATES WERE SOLD. SO THAT THOSE REPORTS HAVE COMPLETELY STOPPED WE DID A BILL WITH US SENATOR NEWMAN THAT SAID THAT OF THAT THE- NONPROFIT US WOULD. WORK WITH THE CDFA AND WE WERE TRANSFERRED TO THEM IN ORDER TO GET TO GET THIS MONEY OUT SO BOTTOM LINE IS THE REPORTS STOPPED THE MONEY YOU GOT. WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY THERE'S BEEN OF THE MONEY HAS BEEN DISTRIBUTED IN SECRET WHEN IT WOULDN'T WOULDN'T WRITTEN A LAW THAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A PART OF OUR NON PROFIT TO BE A PART OF IT. AND THE AND THEY USED A SECRET PANEL AND A SECRET PROCESS AND WE WANT THIS ALL TO STOP THIS IS THE- CALIFORNIANS MONEY. WE MADE A PROMISE TO THEM THAT IT WAS GOING TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO SPAY AND NEUTER PROVIDERS TO SAVE AN ANIMAL'S LIVES THIS IS NOT SOMEBODY SECRET. PROJECT SO PLEASE HELP US TODAY.

AS JUDY SAID I'VE BEEN INVOLVED WITH THIS PROPOSAL SINCE ITS INCEPTION. I AM A TECHNICAL ADVISER TO IT OUR DEPARTMENT A SPACE AND DAUGHTERS AN AVERAGE OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOGS AND CATS EVERY YEAR. SO WE ARE A MAJOR PLAYER IN THE COUNTY OF RIVERSIDE PROVIDING THESE SERVICES. OVER THE YEARS PEOPLE HAVE ACTUALLY ASKED ME WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE LICENSE PLATE AND. UNFORTUNATELY UP UNTIL RECENTLY I HAD TO SAY WELL WE DON'T KNOW OR NOTHING'S HAPPENING IT'S- WHAT IT OR ASIAN IT IS TODAY WHO WILL CHANGE TOMORROW AND THE QUESTION ALWAYS BECOMES WHY SHOULD WE PURCHASE A LICENSE PLATE IF IT GOES FOR SPAY AND NEUTER WILL. WAIT WHERE ARE THE RESULTS. IT'S ONLY. THIS YEAR THAT. SOME FUNDING HAS BEEN DISPERSED AND I HAVE ALSO HEARD. CURRENTLY OF FROM MINOR PROVIDERS A SPAN NEW SERVICES IN THE COUNTY AND FROM INDIVIDUALS AGAIN WHO THINK ABOUT GETTING THEIR ANIMAL SPAYED OR NEUTERED UP POTENTIALLY PURCHASING A LICENSE PLATE QUESTIONING. HOW DID THESE MONIES WE KNOW THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY GOT SOME ABOUT HOW DO I GET THESE MONIES AND I HAVE LOW'S TO BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN TO THEM. THE PROCESS I SAY CDFA OF PROVIDES THE MECHANISM BUT. WE DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THIS PROCESS WORKS I'M CERTAINLY GRATEFUL THE CDFA OVER THE YEARS WE'VE WE'VE. BEEN THE RECIPIENT OF MANY GRANTS FROM THEM INCLUDING SO YOU'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE PROCEDURE AND ASKING FOR TRANSPARENT CORRECT. THANK YOU. WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO THE STATE HONORS PRESENTATION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK INDICATED THIS IS AN AUDIT OF THE PET LOVER SPECIALIZED LICENSE PLATE PLAY PROGRAM. REALLY START LOOKING AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE AND HIS FIRST OBJECTIVE WE HAVE IN OUR PROPOSAL IS. A REALLY LOOKING AT THE PROCESS THAT FOOD NICK USES TO AWARD GRANTS AND LOOKING AT HOW MUCH FUNDING IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE IN THE PROGRAM. HOW MUCH FUNDING HAS BEEN GENERATED SINCE THE PROGRAM BEGAN BACK IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AND THEN HOW MUCH OF THOSE MONIES ARE SPENT ON ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS MARKETING PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES. VERSES GRANTS THAT ARE GETTING OUT TO THE COMMUNITIES TO THAT TO THE CLINICS AND FACILITIES THAT ARE PROVIDING THE SERVICES SO REALLY LOOKING AT SOME FUNDING. BUT ALSO LOOKING AT THE PROCESS AS YOU HEARD FROM THE WITNESSES AND THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOOKING AT THE PROCESS THAT FOOD NAG USES TO. ASSESS GRANT APPLICATIONS AND THEIR DECISION MAKING PROCESS WITH RESPECT TO DENYING A GRANT OR APPROVING A GRANT THE LENGTH OF TIME IT TAKES FOR THAT PROCESS TO TAKE PLACE. AGAIN LOOKING AT THE EAST ANY STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS ANY OTHER REQUIREMENTS THAT FOOD NAG SUPPOSED TO FOLLOW SO MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE FOLLOWING THE PROPER PROTOCOLS. THE OTHER A COUPLE OF OBJECTIVES LOOKING AT COLLABORATION WITH NONPROFIT ENTITIES AND MAKING SURE THAT THE PROGRAM IS BEING IMPLEMENTED. TO THE TO THE MOST EFFECTIVE EXTENT POSSIBLE ARE THEY CONTINUING TO COLLABORATE WITH THE NON PROFITS TO IDENTIFY AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT FOR THE PARTICULAR PROGRAM. SO THERE'S A COUPLE OF OBJECTIVES RELATED TO COLLABORATION A MAJOR OBJECTIVE RELATED TO LOOKING AT THE PROCESS FOR ASSESSING GRANT APPLICATIONS AWARDING THEM OR DENYING THEM AND CERTAINLY LOOKING OUT THE FUNDING. SINCE INCEPTION WHICH WAS BACK IN TWENTY THIRTEEN RELATIVELY SMALL LOT AT NINETEEN HUNDRED HOURS IT'LL TAKE US A LITTLE LESS THAN FIVE MONTHS TO COMPLETE THE WORK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU ATWATER LET ME ASK IF BECAUSE THIS WAS HANDED OUT TO US FROM CDFA AND I BELIEVE THEY GAVE IT TO MR QUIRK OF YOU. YES WE'VE GOT THAT YES DO. RAIN IT DOES ANSWER SOME OF THE QUESTIONS WE'VE HAD. UP THE PROCESS QUESTION PARTICULARLY THE BUSINESS OF A SECRET COMMITTEE. IS ASKING IF THE AUDITOR HAD RECEIVED IT AND SINGLE OKAY. NO I HAVE NOT SEEN THAT LETTER MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU. BUT THIS TIME WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO WE AFFECTED AGENCIES. IT OF THE AFFECTED AGENCIES IF WE HAVE OKAY WITH. YES PLEASE YOU CAN COME HERE YES PLEASE GOOD MORNING MORNING SO IS THAT CHAIR OF VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS RACHEL BRIAN I'M THE DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE WITH ME IS CRYSTAL MYERS SHE'S OUR BRANCH CHIEF OF THE OFFICE OF GRANTS ADMINISTRATION AT CDFA AT CFA WAS DESIGNATED AS THE AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE PET LOVER SPECIALIZED LICENSE PLATE PROGRAM UPON GOVERNOR BROWN'S APPROVAL OF SENATE BILL SIX SEVEN THREE OCTOBER FOURTEENTH TWENTY SEVENTEEN. STATE LAW REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES TO DEPOSIT THE FEES FOR ISSUANCE RENEWAL OR TRANSFER UP THE SPECIALIZED LICENSE PLATE MINUS THEIR COST. INTO THE PLATE FUND MONIES IN THE FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED UPON APPROPRIATION BY THE LEGISLATURE TO CDFA. THE FAA RECEIVED BUDGET AUTHORITY FROM THE LEGISLATURE EFFECTIVE JULY ONE TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO ADMINISTER THE LICENSE PLATE PROGRAM. AT AN ANNUAL LEVEL OF FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THREE YEARS FROM THE FUND. OF THIS AMOUNT UP TO HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND IS ALLOCATED FROM SEA TO FACE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS THIS WAS LAID OUT IN R. B. C. P. PROCESS IN DURING THE PROCESS. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN CDFA SALICYLATE SOLICITED PROPOSALS AND ANNOUNCED AWARDS BETWEEN JANUARY MAY OF TWENTY NINETEEN THIS YEAR. GRANT AGREEMENTS WITH ELEVEN RECIPIENTS WERE EXECUTED BETWEEN JUNE AND AUGUST TWENTY NINETEEN TOTALING THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. ALL ELEVEN WERE ORGANISED TO ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE PREVIOUSLY OR CURRENTLY PROVIDED LOW COST KNOWS NO COST STERILIZATION SEVEN WENT ORGANIZATIONS THAT IDENTIFIED AS PROVIDING SERVICES TO UNDERSERVED AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. THE TOTAL VALUE OF REVENUE COLLECTED BY THE DMV. INTO A SPECIALIZED LICENSE PLATE FIND WAS AFFECT EFFECTIVE JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY NINETEEN WAS ONE MILLION SIX HUNDRED AND 790-009-0060 SEVEN DOLLARS AND ONE CENT. EFFECTIVE AUGUST TWENTY FIRST TWENTY NINETEEN THE BALANCE OF THE FUND FOR THE PET LOVERS LICENSE PLATE WAS ONE MILLION AFFECTED TODAY CFA HAS BEEN INVOICED FOR A TOTAL OF QUARTER INVOICES ARE DO HERE AT THE END OF AUGUST STILL CONTINUE TO ROLL AND AFTER THAT SO THIS IS A FAIRLY NEW PROCESS FOR US. AND WE JUST GOT IT OFF THE GROUND IN THE LAST YEAR. I JUST WANTED TO SHARE ADDITIONALLY THAT FROM JULY FIRST TWENTY EIGHTEEN THROUGH JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY NINETEEN. FORTY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO DOLLARS AND TWELVE CENTS HAS BEEN EXPENDED FOR ADMINISTRATION. ADDITIONALLY 320-008-0090 SEVEN DOLLARS ADMINISTRATIVE FUNDING. HAS BEEN SET ASIDE TO PROMOTE THE LICENSE PLATE THREE IN CERTAIN THE DMV'S RENEWAL NOTICE FOR FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY. CFA IS VERY PROUD OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE TO BE ABLE TO STAND UP THIS PROGRAM AND MEET OUR LEGISLATIVE MANDATE. AND THIS AMOUNT OF TIME TO GET THESE FUNDS OUT TO ELIGIBLE NONPROFITS AND INEFFICIENT AND COLLABORATIVE MANNER WE DID ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS COMMUNICATE WITH SOCIAL COMPASSIONATE LEGISLATION WE HELD A MEETING AND A WEAPON ARE FOR THEIR BENEFIT IN DECEMBER TO COLLECT THEIR INPUT. ON THE R. F. P. PROCESS AS WE WERE DEVELOPING IT WE GOT A DRAFT OF THE R. F. P. FROM THAT THAT MEDICARE MEDICAL BOARD WHO REGION WE ACTUALLY HAD THE PROGRAM AND WAS UNFORTUNATELY NOT ABLE TO GET STAND UP AND GET THE FUNDS OUT. SO WE GOT THAT DROP I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT DRAFT ACTUALLY HAD INPUT AND WAS ACTUALLY ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED BY SOCIAL COMPASSIONATE LEGISLATION SO RIGHT OFF THE BAT GETTING THE R. F. P. THAT THEY HELPED DEVELOP AS THE DRAFT. GETTING THEIR INPUT IN THE WEAPON ARE AND MEETING WITH THE STAKE HOLDERS THAT YOU SAW HERE AT THE TABLE TODAY ON DECEMBER FOURTH AND THEN FURTHER COLLABORATION WHEN WE ANNOUNCED THE AWARDS ALL OF OUR PROCESS HAS BEEN. POSTED ON OUR WEBSITE THROUGH OUR PUBLIC AFFAIRS TEAMS SO WHEN WE PUSH OUT A NOTICE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE R. F. P. WHEN WE PUSHED OUT A PUBLIC NOTICE FOR APPLICANTS TO APPLY TO BE TECHNICAL OUR VIEWERS. OF THE GRANTS THAT WE RECEIVED AND THEN ALONG WITH THE OBVIOUSLY NOTICE OF WHEN THE GRANTS WENT OUT WE ACTUALLY DID THAT NOTICE OF WHEN THE GRANTS WHEN OUT. IN COLLABORATION WITH SOCIAL COMPASSIONATE LEGISLATION WE DIDN'T DO A JOINT PRESS RELEASE BUT WE EACH DID OUR OWN ONE WE MADE THEM AWARE OF WHEN WE WERE GOING TO BE ANNOUNCING. CFA VERY MUCH SUPPORTS TRANSPARENCY AND WOULD WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE THE PROGRAM FOR POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO SECRETARY COULDN'T BE HERE TODAY BUT SHE WANTED ME TO IMPRESS UPON YOU. THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE WORKING ON THIS THE COMMITTEE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER WHETHER AN AUDIT IS PREMATURE AT THIS TIME SINCE THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN AFFECT. FOR APPROXIMATELY ONE YEAR AND IS EXPENDED LESS THAN 3% OF THE ANNUAL MOUNTS AWARDED. I THINK ON THE OTHER END YOU CAN SAY THAT. AN AUDIT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT ENSURES THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD. WE HAVE A GOOD STRONG PROCESS IN PLACE THAT IS TRANSPARENT AND OPEN TO THE PUBLIC. SO WITH THAT THANK YOU AND IT WILL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO ENTERTAIN ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU THIS TIME WHEN WE ASK IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY FROM ANY AFFECTED AGENCIES. HEARING AND SEEING NINE LET ME TURN IT BACK TO THE DÃ­AS OF THE WE HAVE A QUESTION FROM SENATOR ROTH. SIR SINCE YOU INDICATED THAT TERM YOU RECEIVE MOST OF THE ANSWERS TO YOUR QUESTIONS ALBEIT. IN THE LAST DAY OR SO AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH PUBLIC MONEY HERE IN TERMS OF THE EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE AUDIT. ARE YOU ABLE TO MODIFY IN YOUR AUDIT REQUESTED ANYWAY WITH RESPECT TO THE ISSUES OR QUESTIONS THAT YOU'VE AS THE AUDITOR TO ADDRESS OF. TO FOCUS ON THOSE ISSUES OR QUESTIONS OF WITH RESPECT TO WHICH YOU DID NOT RECEIVE ANSWERS. YET SO FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK THE DEPUTY SECRETARY AND THE BRANCH CHIEF. OF THEY REALLY DID A THOROUGH JOB OF ANSWERING QUESTIONS LIKE HOW MUCH MONEY THEY'RE WELL AS HOW MUCH WAS GIVEN OUT. HOW MUCH WAS USED IN ADMINISTRATION. ARE THERE TO ASPECTS OF THIS ONE IS MAKING SURE THAT THAT'S EASILY AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC. AND WE HAVE A PUBLIC MEMBER RIGHT HERE WHO FELT SHE COULDN'T GET THAT INFORMATION. WHO CERTAINLY KNOWS THE SYSTEM SO. AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THEY WILL PUT IN. A BETTER PROCESS BUT FRANKLY THE THING THAT BOTHERS ME THE MOST WAS HEARING FROM THE BRANCH CHIEF. BAD IT IS STANDARD PROCEDURE TO HAVE A COMMITTEE LIKE THIS BE CONFIDENTIAL SO THAT IT WOULDN'T FEEL PRESSURE. AND YOU KNOW. THIS IS STRANGE AND IF IT IS STANDARD PROCEDURE IN CDFA AND WE'LL FIND OUT IF IT'S STANDARD PROCEDURE ACROSS THE STATE ARM. I HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND I THINK YOU WOULD TO BECAUSE AGAIN WE HAVE PLENTY OF VOLUNTEERS TO DO THIS TO THE LOCAL LEVEL I KNOW. PEOPLE ARE ANXIOUS TO SERVE ON COMMITTEES LIKE THIS. ARM PARTICULARLY. I JUST DON'T SEE HOW THAT WOULD BE. OUR PROBLEM MAKING THAT PUBLIC AND HAVING. AND HAVING MEETINGS WHERE IT THE PROCESS IS. SHOWN TO THE PUBLIC SO I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY MY BIGGEST CONCERN ARM. WELL I'M JUST I'M LISTEN I'M SUPPORT OF THE AUDIT I JUST NOTICED THAT THERE RIGHT WELL THERE TWELVE ISSUES OR QUESTIONS HERE AND YOU INDICATED THAT. YOU HAD ANSWERS TO SOME OF THEM AND I WAS JUST WONDERING RIGHT HOW MANY OF THE TWELVE WE CAN CROSS OFF THE LIST WE CAN SAY THE AUDITOR'S SOME TIME AND SAVE SOME MONEY YEAH I THINK YOU WE CAN IN PARTICULAR THAT THE DOLLARS ARE THERE. ANDMUCH OTHER INFORMATION IS THERE SO MAYBE WE CAN SAVE SOME MONEY ON THE AUDIT I AGREE I THINK THAT THE LARGER QUESTION IS AS THE AUDITOR'S SAID HIS PROCESS. I PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROCESS FOR THE COMMITTEE ARE WE CAN TALK ABOUT OTHER ISSUES AS WELL NOW THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU CENTER AND I WOULD JUST IMAGINE SINCE SOME OF THE INFORMATIONS ALREADY PRESENTED IT WOULD TAKE LESS STAFF TIME TO. TO GET THESE ANSWERS WHICH IN EFFECT WOULD LOWER THE COST PROBABLY OF THE ADDED MAYBE THE STAFF HOURS NEEDED. CERTAINLY MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS IT WOULD I MEAN OBVIOUSLY I JUST SEEING THE LETTER NOW AND THERE IS INFORMATION A LETTER WHAT I WOULD EXPECT MY STAFF TO DO IS. GO INTO THE FINANCIAL RECORDS TO VERIFY. WHAT THEY'RE ASSERTING IN THE LETTER BUT IF IT'S- IN FACT CORRECTED THAT IS GOING TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT WOULD TAKE MY STAFF TO. TO COMPLETE CERTAIN OBJECTIVES ABSOLUTELY YEAH AND I'LL ALSO ADD. THAT THE DEPUTY SECRETARY IN BRANCH CHIEF BROUGHT. A WHOLE FOLDER TO ME WHICH I BELIEVE. THEY WILL BE GIVING TO YOU SHORTLY. AND IT IT REALLY DOES ANSWER A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS. I THINK THE MAIN QUESTION HERE IS PROCESS RIGHT NOW. AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT I HEARD IN THE TESTIMONY AS WELL AS A TRANSPARENCY IN THE PROCEDURES IN PLACE FOR AYE. HOW THIS IS ACTUALLY DONE IMPLEMENTED AND I KNOW THE PROGRAM'S FAIRLY. FAIRLY NEO I EVER SINCE THE NEWMAN LEGISLATION AS WELL SO. OKAY WITH THAT LET ME ASK THERE'S ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FROM THE DÃ­AS. SENATOR MORLOCK THE WOMAN SAID HER MONEY. MISTER CHAIR BACK TWENTY FIFTEEN WE HELD A HEARING WITH THE SENATE GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE COMMITTEE AND WE LOOKED AT THE VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS AND MONEY THAT WAS GOING BY THE CHECK OFF ON THE FORM FIVE FORTY AND- AND HOW THE CONTROLLER WAS SORT OF HOLDING ON TO THAT MONEY. I SEE THAT AS THE ISSUE HERE I THOUGHT MAYBE THE CONTROLLER COULD PROVIDE SOME MORE DETAILS AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. THE ISSUE IS JUST HOW ARE THE NONPROFIT SELECTED AND HOW'S THE MONEY DISTRIBUTED. AND I'M I'M WONDERING. HOW MANY. SPECIALIZED PLATES DO WE STILL HAVE BETTER. RECEIVING FUNDS AND SHOULD WE TAKE A HOLISTIC LOOK TO SEE. WHAT'S THE PROCESS FOR ALL OF THEM INSTEAD OF JUST ONE SO WE CAN. MAKE SURE WE HAVE YOU KNOW ABOUT A PUT AN APPROPRIATE. YOU KNOW TRANSPARENT RESPONSIBLE MANNER FOR GRANTING FUNDS TO ALL NONPROFIT CENTER BENEFITING FROM THIS PROGRAM. AND I'M I'M JUST WONDERING ALSO WITH PERHAPS WE SHOULD REQUIRE MORE REPORTING TO THE LEGISLATURE ON AN ANNUAL REPORT ON WHERE'S THAT MONEY COMING. FROM AND HOW MUCH IS IT WHERE'S IT GOING IN I DON'T KNOW IF SPENDING TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ON AUDIT FOR SOMETHING THAT'S SUPPOSED TO GENERATE. FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND YEARS. I AFFECTED BUT I'D- LIKE TO GET THE WHOLE THING FIX NOT JUST. ONE SPECIFIC PLAY AND I THINK WHAT WE'RE IF YOU WANTED TO AUDIT ALL OF THEM THAT WOULD BE A LOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND. I THINK IF WE CAN JUST AUDIT WINE. AND THEN YOU AND I CAN CO AUTHOR OF BAIL. TO TAKE TO SEE WHAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM THERE. AND START A PROCESS. AS HE SAID PARTICULARLY THE QUESTION FOR ME IS THE SELECTION OF THE COMMITTEES DOES THAT NEED REALLY NEED TO BE CONFIDENTIAL I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE'LL FIND OUT IN THE OFFICE. DID THEIR DELIBERATIONS NEED TO BE CONFIDENTIAL. AGAIN IF THIS IS A NORMAL PRACTICE IN THE STATE. THAT I THINK THAT THIS IS A STATE WIDE ISSUE WHEN YOU AND I CAN WORK ON IT TOGETHER I'D BE HONORED SO IMMIGRANT QUIRK. BECAUSE I THINK IF WE COULD NARROW IT TO THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE I THINK WE OUGHT TO BE. RATHER SIMPLE FOR ALL THE PLATE. A FULL LOOK GO AHEAD. IN ORDER TO PLACE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. JUST TO. INFORM MEMBERS WE ACTUALLY DID AN AUDIT ON THE SPECIAL INTERESTS LICENSE PLATE PROGRAM AT THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES WE DID THE ORIGINAL AUDIT AND ISSUED IN APRIL OF TWENTY THIRTEEN IT'S A BIT OLD WE HAD ISSUES WE FELT THAT THE STATE WAS FOR GOING REVENUES RELATED TO THE PROGRAM SOME OF THE EXPENDITURES WERE NOT STE PROPERLY SUPPORTED SO WE REALLY QUESTIONS SOME THINGS. WE DID A SUBSEQUENT FOLLOW UP ON IT IN TWENTY FIFTEEN IDENTIFIED THERE ARE STILL SOME ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO HOW THE ENVY WAS MANAGING THE PROGRAM WE HAVE NOT BEEN BACK SINCE THEN SO WE COULD EITHER DO A FOLLOW UP ON IT IF WE HAVE RESOURCES AVAILABLE WE COULD CERTAINLY DO THAT FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND GET YOU INFORMATION. PERHAPS BY EARLY NEXT YEAR EASILY I WOULD THINK THIS PARTICULAR JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON WHAT WE DID OR IF MEMBERS ARE INTERESTED IN REQUESTING A DIFFERENT AUDIT WE CERTAINLY WOULD BE. HAPPY TO DO ANY WORK THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE US TO DO JUST WANTED TO LET THE MEMBERS NOW. THANK YOU FOR SHAPE THAT I BELIEVE THERE SOME AVENUES ARE TO PURSUE SIR MORLOCK OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROCEDURES OF THE TRANSPARENCIES IN PLACE FOR ALL OF MY THINK IS WHERE YOU WERE HEADED. MISTER PARKS LOOKING AT ONE SPECIALIZED. PLATE RIGHT NOW THE OTHERS THAT'S MORE CAN PASS A MAYBE. MAYBE FROM THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THIS OUT OF MOVES FORWARD WE CAN USE THAT AS WELL. AT TWO AND FOUR MAYBE FUTURE LEGISLATION. WELL I WOULD THINK A FOLLOW UP ON IT WOULD. WOULD BE. PREFERABLE AND PROBABLY. MORE COST EFFECTIVE AND PROBABLY. GETS TO WHERE WE ALL WANT TO BE. RIGHT AND WE HAVE JUST SO THE MEMBERS UNDERSTAND WE DO HAVE STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT FOLLOW UP WORK SO WE- WE'VE DONE ONE FOLLOW UP SPENT A LITTLE WHILE WE CAN GET BACK IN THERE AND DO SOME MORE WORK. THANK AND THEN IF THAT DOESN'T WORK AND- THE ASSEMBLYMAN AND I WILL. JOINT AUTHOR A BILL TO GET BETTER REPORTING OUT OF. C. F. CDFA. WELL IT'S REALLY ALL THE DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE INVOLVED. VIDEO AND I MEAN IT'S NOT JUST LICENSE PLATE PROGRAMS. WE HAD IF IT IS TRUE. THAT IT'S A STANDARD. I HAVE KEEP THEM. THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LIKE THIS SECRET I AND ALSO THE DELIBERATIONS I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING YOU KNOW GOES WAY BEYOND LICENSE PLATES SO I THINK WE REALLY NEED IF WE CAN UNDERSTAND THIS PROGRAM AND WHETHER OR NOT THOSE CONDITIONS ARE JUSTIFIED THEN WE COULD START LOOKING AT THE MORE GENERAL PROGRAM WHICH GOES WAY BEYOND LICENSE BITES YEAH I AGREE WITH THAT BECAUSE IT ALSO. IMPACTS HE'S VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTION YEAH ABSOLUTE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE MONEY JUST LANGUISHES THE STATE CONTROLLER'S DOING NOTHING WITH THEM SO I THINK THAT'S THE BIG ISSUES THAT GET SOME UNIFORMITY AND- GET SOME GOOD REPORTING. I GET IT. THANK YOU WITHOUT WILL MOVE SENATOR MONEY PLEASE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I APPRECIATE THIS DIALOGUE. I CAN WANT TO COME BACK TO THE QUESTION OF SENATOR ROTH THOUGH IT SEEMS IN LIGHT OF SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED. A BIT DATED YESTERDAY HERE FEW DAYS AGO. MAYBE THIS QUESTION FOR THE AUDITOR. GIVEN THE INFORMATION THAT'S AVAILABLE WITH THAT CONFORM OR OR FOR FURTHER FOCUS THE WORK OF THE AUDITOR TO THE OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS OR SOME OF THE PROCESS QUESTIONS THAT MIGHT NECESSARILY INVOLVE. LOOKING IT. CDOS PROTOCOLS IN IN THISINSTANCE WITH RESPECT TO CDFA BUT THAT THERE MIGHT BE OF. A LEARNING CURVE FROM THE AUDIT ON THIS PROGRAM THE COULD ALSO INFORM SOME OF THE QUESTIONS. ASKED BY SENATOR MORLOCK. CERTAINLY MISSED A CENTER MINING IT IT WOULD SAVE US SOME TIME I MEAN I THINK THE COMMITTEE HAS TO DECIDE I DON'T I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THE COMMITTEE IS SUGGESTING THAT THE AUDIT ANALYSIS BE MODIFIED AND THERE ARE ROUTE COMMITTEE RULES WITH RESPECT TO THAT BUT WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS. BASED ON THE QUICK REVIEW OF THIS LETTER IT WILL CERTAINLY SAVE TIME AND IT WILL ALLOW US TO DO OUR DUE DILIGENCE FOR CERTAIN OBJECTIVES RELATED TO THE AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THE FIND OF THE AMOUNT HAS BEEN SPENT. I THINK THAT WILL BE RELATIVELY QUICK WE CAN VERIFY THAT WHAT THEY'VE ASSERTED IS ACCURATE. AND REALLY. FOCUS OUR ATTENTION ON PROCESS AND PROTOCOLS PARTICULARLY FOR. SOLICITING GRANT APPLICATIONS AND THEN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS WITH RESPECT TO APPROVING A GRANT OR DENYING A GRANT SO WE WOULD BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON THAT. THANK YOU THAT'S HELPFUL TO ME IN MISTER TRAINER STAND TO DO A FORMAL AMENDMENT OF THE AUDIT REQUIRE CERTAIN PROCEDURES BUT- I THINK THAT REASSURANCE. FROM THE AUDITOR THAT. THEY'VE DONE THIS BEORE AND THEY WILL. STREAMLINED WHERE INFORMATION'S AVAILABLE AND- CONCENTRATE RESOURCES. ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE STILL OUTSTANDING SO THANK YOU. THANK SENATOR WHAT THAT. YET ON MR MUNNINGS POINT JUST JUST JUST ONE POINT OF CLARIFICATION I DO APOLOGIZE THAT THESE WERE NOT GIVEN TO THE STATE AUDITOR WE WERE MADE AWARE THESE QUESTIONS FOR THE FIRST TIME LAST MONDAY SO WE WERE PULLING THIS INFORMATION TOGETHER WE WANT TO MAKE IT A PRIORITY TO MEET WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FIRST WHICH WE FINALLY DID YESTERDAY I ACTUALLY WASN'T AWARE OF THE PROCESS THAT WAS REALLY JUST ME BEING ABLE TO REACH OUT TO THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE AT THAT WAS.

EMPLOYERS FOUND THAT MANY CHIEF NURSING OFFICER THE OFFICERS ARE HAVING TROUBLE RECRUITING NURSES AND MORE THAN EIGHTY OF HOSPITALS REPORTED THAT THE DEMAND FOR NURSES WAS GREATER THAN THE AVAILABILITY OF SUPPLY. THE REPORT ESTIMATES THAT BY TWO. IT WILL BE SHORT OF BY OVER SEVEN THOUSAND NURSES IN A BASELINE SCENARIO ESTIMATE IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE CURRENT RATIO OF SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO FULL TIME EQUIVALENT IS ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE. AND JUST AS A POINT OF REFERENCE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE IS ONE THOUSAND THIRTY EIGHT TIME EQUIPMENT NURSES TO ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE CLEAR SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT IN CALIFORNIA. IN ADDITION TO RAPID POPULATION OF SEAT. LONG TERM SERVICES EXPECTING OF MEDI CAL AND THE STATE HEALTH CARE EXCHANGE UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT HAS EXTENDED HEALTH CARE OUR HEALTH INSURANCE TO MORE THAN FIVE. CALIFORNIANS WHO WERE PRE WE WITHOUT COVER. THIS SIX COVER IN OUR- TO ACCESS TO CARE TO THE REMAINING THREE MILLION CALIFORNIANS COURSE STILL UNINSURED HAS CREATED NEW DEMAND FOR HAVE HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS OF ALL TYPES FROM NURSES TO DOCTORS ACCORDING TO THE BEER AND OWN DATA IN THE TWO TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN NURSING PROGRAMS RECEIVED EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND AND FOR QUALIFIED OP ENDS WITH ONLY.

MANY OF THESE STUDENTS TO PRIVATE COLLEGE. HOWEVER THE B. R. AND PREVENTS STUDENTS FROM RECEIVING EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES BY PLACING CAPS ON NURSING COLLEGE ENROLLMENTS. CURRENTLY THE BEER AND CLAIMS TO HAVE SOLE AUTHORITY TO RESTRICT THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT CAN PURSUE A DEGREE IN NURSING THROUGH CALIFORNIA THAT'S CONTROLLING THE MARKET AND SUPPLY OF NURSES. NO OTHER LICENSING BOARD HAS A PRETTY. IMAGINE OUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE COMMISSION TEACHER CREDENTIALING RESTRICTED THE AMOUNT OF STUDENTS ENTERING INTO A CREDENTIALING PROGRAM. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE MEDICAL BOARD RESTRICTED THE AMOUNT OF DOC TRANG INTO A MEDICAL PROFESSION AND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE CALIFORNIA BAR. THE AMOUNT OF THE TURN. IT IS THE SAME THING THAT'S HAPPENED HERE. IF THESE TRENDS ARE NOT REJECTING A PROGRAM APPLICANTS WHY ARE WE ALLOWING THE IRAN TO RESTRICT PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS THIS AUDIT AS THE BAND. TOOK REGARDING THE PRACTICES OF THE BOWL. A REVIEW OF ITS INTERNAL OPERATIONS AND POLICY POSITIONS SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN DETERMINE THE B. R. AND MEETING PRIMARY. OF LIGHT ENSURE.

ON A PARTICULAR AREA THAT WAS MENTIONED IN THE REQUEST LETTER THAT SHE HAS ASKED US TO LOOK AT AS CLINICAL DISPLACEMENT. OUR PROCESS AND THIS IS WHERE SCHOOL MADE THIS. STATE FOR ALL TYPES OF STUDENTS IN ASKING US AGAIN LOOKING AT CONCERTS AND SEE PROCESS DECISION MAKING WITH RESPECT TO. OUR SITUATIONS WHERE CLINICAL DISPLACEMENT. OCCURS ON THE LAST COUPLE OF OBJECTIVES. IS SITE YOU HEARD. ABOUT A NATION SO THE QUESTION THAT IS RUBIO IS ASKING US TO LOOK AT IS WHAT TO BE OUR ENDS OVERSIGHT AND WATER FUNCTIONS ARE THEY CONDUCTING OR ACTIVITIES ARE THEY CONDUCTING VERSUS WHAT CREDITING AGENCY COM OR ASSOCIATION COMES IN IT IS THERE IS B. R. AND DOING THINGS THAT TYPICALLY BY AN ACCREDITING OUR AGENCY IN A NURSING SCHOOL SO WHAT TO SEE IF THERE IS A DUPLICATE IF THERE'S OVERLAP. SITE AND THEN LAST AREAS. LOOKING OUT WORKING WORKFORCE ANALYSIS WHAT. DOES IRAN AT NO THEY WITH THE UNIVERSE CALIFORNIA AND GOT SOME ANALYSIS SHE'S ASKING US TO COMPARE THEIR- THESE TO OTHER ANALYSES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE AND WHAT IS THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING DO. WITH RESPECT TO NOT ONLY LOOKING AT THE ANALYSES THAT HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TO THEM BY THEIR CONCERTS SINCE. OTHER AND SEES TO REALLY GATE. THE WORK FORCE TO LOOK LIKE IN THE FUTURE AND WHAT THE DEMAND WILL BE FOR A NURSES IN CALIFORNIA. AND THE BUDGET FOR THIS PARTICULAR AUDIT TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED HOURS THAT'S ABOUT A SIX MONTH PROJECT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR RIGHT. THANK YOU. WITH THAT WILL GO HEAD TO MOVE TO THE AFFECTED AGENCIES THANK YOU IF YOU KEEP YOUR COMMENTS TO SINK TO THE AUDIT WOULD APPRECIATE THAT JUST LIKE THE PREVIOUS I REQUEST THAT WE HAD. PLEASE BEGIN BY SAYING YOUR NAME. THANK YOU. THE MORNING HI I'M DOCTOR JOE MORE SEND EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE BOARD. BUT TO MY RIGHT PARK DR SUSAN ANGLE NURSING EDUCATION CONSULTANT WITH THE CALIFORNIA BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING THANK YOU. AND HIDE DOCTOR DOLENZ BUT SOME AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO CONTRACTOR TO THE BOARD AND AWARE OF THE NURSING SHORTAGE DATA. THANK YOU. CHRISTINE IS FOR DEPUTY CHIEF OF THE LICENSING AND ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES WITH BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING. OKAY THANK YOU. THE MORNING ON WHICH HEARING COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AGAIN I AM DOCTOR JOSEPH MORRIS ALSO REGISTERED NURSE AND EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR THE CALIFORNIA BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING. THE BOARD IS THE LARGEST HEALING ARTS FOR IN THE UNITED STATES WITH OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND LICENSEES AND APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR NURSING SCHOOLS. THE BOARD'S MISSION TO PROTECT AN ADVOCATE FOR THE HEALTH AND SAFETY THE PUBLIC. I'M HERE ALONG WITH THE STAFF TO ADDRESSING YOUR CONCERNS. RESPECTFULLY THE BOARD DOES NOT FEEL THIS PROPOSE AUDIT IS WARRANTED. THE BOARD IS CONFIDENT IN ASSURING THE COMMITTEE THAT CALIFORNIA'S ALREADY SUCCESSFULLY AVERTED THE NURSING SHORTAGE. SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE NUMBER OF NURSES. THAT ARE LICENSE HERE IN CALIFORNIA HAS DEALT FROM THOUSAND. AND THE NUMBER OF APPROVED SCHOOLS HAVE INCREASE FROM ONE HUNDRED NINETEEN TO ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR. THEREFORE FUNDAMENTAL REASON FOR DISAGREEING REQUEST NUMBER ONE THE CONTEXT OF PERCEPTION OF THE STATEWIDE NURSING SHORTAGE DOCTOR SPECS A RENOWNED ECONOMIST IN LEE RESEARCHER CONTRACTED BY THE BOARD SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE HAS PROVIDED NUMEROUS REPORTS INDICATING THAT THE NURSING FORCES ADEQUATELY POSITIONS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA HOWEVER SHE HAS IN HER RESEARCH THERE ARE REGIONAL DIFFERENCES. SECOND THERE ADEQUATE CHECKS AND BALANCES TO THE- INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE SUNSET REVIEW PROCESS THE PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST ACT AND THE OPEN MEETINGS. THIRD THIS AUDIT COULD REQUIRE A REVIEW AND FOR ALL OF THE ENTITIES SUCH AS THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. UCSF AND THE F. PPC. ADDITIONALLY THIS ARCTIC COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE LITIGATION INVOLVING THE BOARD. LAST WEEK TO ENSURE THAT THE NEW PROGRAMS SCHOOL APPROVAL AND EXPANSION PROCESS IS EQUITABLE AND TRANSPARENT THE NURSING EDUCATION SULTANS AND THE BOARD USE THE REGULATORY STANDARD OUTLINED IN SIXTEEN C. C. R. FOURTEEN TWENTY TWO FOURTEEN THIRTY TWO AND THEIR RECOMMENDATION TO DISTANCE WERE PROVEN SCHOOLS. THE BOARD RECOGNIZED THE STAKEHOLDERS CONFUSION BROWN OF OUR AUTHORITY REGARDING ENROLLMENT. AND BRING IT BRING TO BRING CLARITY TO THIS ISSUE. EARLY THE BOARD IS CURRENTLY PROPAGATING REGULATIONS AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR DELAY IN YOUR VOTE SO THAT WE CAN WORK THIS OUT. HEY CLOSING. THE BOARD I WANT TO THINK THE LEGISLATORS FOR THEIR APPROVING ABOUT SIXTY SEVEN POSITIONS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THESE POSITIONS WILL HELP SUPPORT THE BOARDS MISSION AND ALLOW US TO CONTINUE TO UPDATE OUR PROCESSES AND IDENTIFY EFFICIENCIES TO SERVE THE PUBLIC THANK YOU ARE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AT THE SIMON WE ASK IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL AFFECTED AGENCIES. HEY WE WILL TURN IT BACK TO MEMBERS ON THE DOT YES WE WILL BEGIN WITH QUESTIONS FROM SENATOR ROBB. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. YOU KNOW THIS IS A COMPLICATED ISSUE AND IT'S ONE THAT I'VE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT FOR SOME TIME AND- WE'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN THIS. IN THIS BUILDING. AND I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE COVERS IS DEALING WITH. DECISION SHORTAGES UP AND DOWN THE STATE. CHARGES OF OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. I OF COURSE IN PRIVILEGEDTO REPRESENT A DISTRICT IN INLAND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND- I HAVE COLLEAGUES THAT REPRESENT TO ANOTHER DISTRICT IT'S TO THE EAST TO MAIL IN THE COACHELLA VALLEY. THIS ABOUT WHETHER THERE'S AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF NURSES OR SHORTAGE OF NURSES I GUESS IF YOU AVERAGE THE NURSE PRODUCTION IN THE NURSES THAT ARE PRACTICING UP AND DOWN THE STATE AND- ADEQUATE. BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT. HELLO VALLEY WHO DO NOT FEEL IT'S A SURPRISE ADEQUATE AND IN LOOKING AT THE BOARD'S OWN REPORT THE HEADLINE WAS INTERESTING TO ME TODAY ON TWENTY ONE MEETING FUTURE NEEDS FOR NURSES A CHALLENGE OF BOTH NUMBERS AND SKILLS. AND YOUR OWN REPORT YOU SAY THERE IS A VERY THE ADEQUACY OF OUR AND SUPPLY ACROSS REGIONS OF CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE RECENT ANALYSIS THE SANDWICH ONLY PROJECTED SIGNIFICANT OUR SHORTAGES OVER THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS. SO THIS ISSUE ABOUT RESTRICTING ENROLLMENT AT NURSING SCHOOLS IS PROBLEMATIC HE WITHOUT FURTHER ANALYSIS IN AN EFFORT TO DO WHAT WE'RE DOING ON THE PHYSICIAN AREA WHICH IS TO. ATTEMPT TO INCENTIVIZE AND. TING GRADUATE. I MOVED TO IN PRACTICE. IS WHERE THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT SHORTAGE NOW I'M NOT A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER WE HAVE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS ON THE PANEL. CERTAINLY DEFERRED TO THEM. FOR THEIR EXPERTISE SO WE HAVE THIS ISSUE ABOUT ADEQUATE SUPPLY OR SHORTAGE THAT CERTAINLY NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BUT SOUNDS LIKE BOARD IN SOME PUBLICATION HAS. RECOGNIZED AS SOME OF THOSE SHORTAGES WE ALSO A SITUATION. WELL AND NOW I'VE SAID ON EDUCATION BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE SO I KNOW THE FUNDING WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE INSUFFICIENT FUNDING TOWARD OUR PUBLIC. NURSING PROGRAMS POSTED THE CAL STATE AND IN OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE. SYSTEM AND THE ONES WE HAVE ARE IMPACTED BEYOND BELIEF WITH WAITING LISTS THAT PEOPLE GROW OLD CITY AND- AWAITING SLOT ONE OF ITS PRO. THEN FOR PUBLIC THIS IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE'S BEEN A OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IT SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE- ACCREDITATION STANDARDS FOR OUR- ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS WHERE IN ORDER TO. ATTAIN A TOP. OF ACCREDITING STANDARD MAGNET STATUS THE HOSPITAL IS. SORT OF FORCED TO EITHER HIGHER. BSN BATCHES DEGREE NURSES ARE NURSES THAT ARE IN TRAINING TO GET THEIR BACHELOR'S DEGREE. WHICH PROBABLY IMPACTS THE DESIRE OF SOME OF THESE HOSPITALS TO. SIGN UP WITH COMMUTE ARE VERY EXCELLENT COMMUNITY COLLEGE NURSING PROGRAMS AND TAKE THEIR STUDENTS IN TRAINING BECAUSE OF COURSE THIS IS AN ADDED. BURDEN ON THE HOSPITAL TRYING TO PROVIDE MEDICAL CARE THAT. PROVIDE BILLABLE SERVICES IN HOSPITALS ICE BACK TO USE THIS AS A MEANS TO REVIEW AND WATCH NURSING STUDENT THE SERVER WHICH ONES ARE GOING HIGHER AND IF THE PREFERENCES. ARE BAD. HIS DEGREE IS THERE. TO PUT. THAT'S RETRAINING. MISSING STUDENTS IN TO TAKE A LOOK AT THEM. AND OF COURSE WE'VE HAD SEVERAL OF MADE SEVERAL ATTEMPTS IN THIS HOUSE OVER THE LAST FIVE OR SIX OR SEVEN YEARS TO. GRANT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE ASSORTED WORK BACHELOR'S DEGREES IN THERE CAN PROGRAMS IN THOSE EFFORTS HAVE HAVE BEEN DEFEATED EACH EACH AND EVERY TIME. THAT THEY'VE BEEN PUT FORWARD SO. OF OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE IMPACTED DOES IT DEMAND FOR BACHELORS DEGREE NURSES WE HAVE AN EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF INSTITUTIONS THAT AWARD BATCHES DEGREES. OUR COMMUNITY ARE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY NURSING PROGRAM PIPELINE FROM COMMUNITY COLLEGE. TO THE C. ISSUES IS CLOGGED. TO SAY THE LEAST WE BEGUN SOME EFFORTS AND PILOT PROGRAMS TO SORT OF OPEN UP THAT PIPELINE TO. PERMIT OF MORE FLOWS THROUGH FROM OUR- EIGHTY IN TO BE AS AN PROGRAM BUT- THAT'S YET TO SPEAK WE GET TO SEE WHETHER THOSE EFFORTS ARE GONNA. EXCEPT FOR. SO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BY EITHER AN AUDIT OR AN OVERSIGHT HEARING IN PROBABLY THE OUGHT IT'S THE BEST WAY TO DO IT. IS A REALLY A CLINICAL SLOT. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OR IS THE- SLOT PROBLEM ONE WHERE THE HOSPITALS WHERE WE DO THE CORE MOST OF THE CLINICAL WORK I ASSUME ARE PREFERRING BATCHES DEGREES BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE ACCREDITING AGENCIES WANT THEM TO OR THE OR THEIR OTHER ALTERNATIVES FOR CLINICAL SLOT PLACEMENTS. FOR OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE NURSING PER. COULD DO THE SAME THING PROVIDE THE SAME TRIP AND PROVIDE THE SAME HIGH QUALITY NURSES THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE COMING OUT OF THOSE PROGRAMS. DOES THE BOARD AUTHORITY. I DISAGREE WITH WITH THE DIRECTOR AS HE KNOWS DOES THE BOARD HAVE AUTHORITY WITHIN THE EXISTING STATUTES AND REGULATIONS TO ADJUST ENROLLMENT UP OR DOWN. BECAUSE AS- THE PROPONENT OF THIS REQUEST NOTED WE DON'T DO THAT IN ANY OTHER PROFESSION. AND I READ THE REGULAR WHEN I READ THE STATUTE IN PARTICULAR THE REGULATION THAT YOU CITE. AND I'M NOAH THIRTY FOR THE BOARD TO MAKE ANY ADJUSTMENT UP OR DOWN AND ENROLLMENT RATHER YOUR THIRTY IS TO APPROVE OR DISAPPROVE PROGRAMS AND IF YOU WANT THE AUTHORITY IN MY VIEW YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO ADOPT REGULATIONS. AND THE AND THE STANDARDS HAVE TO TIED TO FACILITIES FACULTY TO STUDENT RATIO BRICK AND MORTAR FACILITIES AND THE LIKE SO. I WAS TAUGHT LAW SCHOOL TO ASK A QUESTION THERE IS NO QUESTION THERE I WANTED TO MAKE MY POSITION HOWEVER CLEAR. IN MY- EXPRESSION OF SUPPORT FOR THE AUDIT NO I DO. ONE OF THE DISADVANTAGES OF BEING ON THIS COMMITTEE I AM HEARING OTHER REQUESTS AS WE REALLY DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DRAFTING OF THE QUESTIONS AS I'VE INDICATED TO THE- AND I'VE I THINK THAT ARE SOME QUESTIONS SUCH AS THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST QUESTION IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW QUESTION THAT ARE NOT REALLY RELEVANT TO MY CONCERNS. AND I WOULD PREFER THAT THOUGH. BUT IT BUT I DO THINK THAT THE OVER. ISSUES OF CLINICAL SLOT AVAILABILITY. HOW WE RESTRICT ENROLLMENT AND BY THE WAY THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS STEPPED UP. IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL. WHEN SUFFICIENT. AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE AND HOW WE RESTRICT AND ROMAN TO THAT THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS OF ONE WE CAN'T GRADUATE ENOUGH IN OUR PUBLIC PROGRAM. AT A TIME WHEN WE HAVE SHORTAGES AROUND THE STATE. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS. THE AUDIT I WOULD ASK AND I'M SURE I HAVE SOME COLLEAGUES THAT ARE GONNA BE ASKING THESE QUESTIONS THE AUTHOR TO TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE QUESTIONS AND BETTER THAN THE OTHER REQUEST. BUT I LOOK FORWARD THE AUDIT REPORT TO MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU FOR YOUR STATEMENT AND YEAH JUST TO CLARIFY IT IS IN THE LAST THE PREVIOUS I REQUEST TO KNOW WE'RE- COMMITTED BY THE JOINT RULES. AS AMENDING THE. TELLING WATER. WITH THAT WE DO HAVE A NUMBER OF MEMBERS WITH. WE WILL MOVE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON CENTER MORE LIKE THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHAT. THANK CHAIR. I WANT TO ASSOCIATE MY MIKE COMMENTS WITH THE SENATE ROTH WE SHOULD THE COMMENTS THAT HE MADE I ALSO WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE- AUTHOR OF THIS. AND I WANT US TO BE THINKING A LITTLE ABOUT THE BUREAUCRACY IN A LITTLE LESS ABOUT WHETHER THERE'S A SHORTAGE OF WHETHER THERE IS A SHORTAGE OBVIOUSLY THERE IS AMPLE EVIDENCE THAT THEIR SHORTAGES IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA INTO THE NIGHT. IS BIG RECALL WITH THOSE OF US WHO REPRESENT THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA. SUGGEST THAT WE NEED TO BE THINKING. ABOUT STUDENTS. WHO HAVE A PASSION. WHO OFTENTIMES GO INTO NURSING AS A CALLING. AND FOR THE B. R. N. TO ESSENTIALLY BE THE GATEKEEPER TO THEIR OPPORTUNITY A GATEKEEPER TO THEIR DREAMS ARE I THINK YEAH. RAISES THE REAL QUESTION WE'RE NOT BE IRAN IS ACTUALLY. PERFORMING SARAH STATUTORY DUTIES OR GETTING INTO AREAS IT HAS NO BUSINESS GETTING INTO. BUT LET'S STIPULATE FOR THAT THERE MAY OR MAY NOT BE A SHORTAGE. THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE SEEKING AN EDUCATION. AND THEY ARE SEEKING A PASSION THEY ARE SEEKING TO BE. A LICENSED AND ABLE TO DO THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN TRAINED FOR. AND THAT THEY WANT TO DO. DOES IT MATTER WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS A SHORTAGE HERE. I DON'T THINK SO. BECAUSE THEY CAN FIND. REWARDING NURSING SERVICE. IN PLACES OTHER THAN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND QUITE FRANKLY THAT TO ME I ESTÃ¡N ARRAKIS ADJUSTED. I THINK THERE'S A HUGE OVER REACH A HUGE OVER STEP. IN WHAT BE ARE AND- IS IT IS ATTEMPTING TO DO HERE I AGREE WITH MY BREAD BREAD DISPATCHERS I FIND NO. GRANT OF THE KIND OF AUTHORITY THAT YOU'RE ATTEMPTING TO EXERCISE HERE IT ESSENTIALLY SHUTTING DOWN SAYING NO I THINK YOUR RESPONSIBILITY IS. WITH RESPECT TO HEALTH AND SAFETY IN THESE KIND AND THE EXPERTISE AND TRAINING ALL OF THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. TO SAY YES. TO THOSE WHO ARE QUALIFIED THOSE WHO ARE READY TO GO TO WORK IN THOSE WHO ARE ARE ARE PASSING THEIR TESTS AND DOING EVERYTHING WE'VE EXPECTED THEM TO DO BUT INSTEAD YOU'RE SAYING NO. OR WAIT OR MAYBE. REPRESENTING GENDER CALIFORNIA HERE AND ALSO MAYOR FOR EIGHT YEARS FRESNO I CAN TELL YOU THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE NUMBER ONE ISSUES OF CONCERN THAT CONSTITUENTS IN MY AREA TALK TO ME ABOUT WE REGULARLY INTEREST HE. WITH B. R. AT QUITE FRANK. ON BEHALF OF ST STE GRADUATES WHO HAVE. EMPLOYMENT IN OUR HOSPITALS. AND CANNOT BE APPROVED IN A TIMELY WAY ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE CROSSED ALL THE TEASE DOT ALL THE I'S THEY HAVE IN FACT DONE ALL OF THE THINGS WE EXPECT THEM TO DO. BUT THE CLOCK RUNS OUT. WE HAD A. A SERIES OF CONSTITUENT THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAD WOULD ADDRESS WITH CONSTITUENTS ARE PROCESS WITH RESPECT TO AT LEAST FIVE NURSES WHO HAD CONDITIONAL JOB OFFERS FROM MILD ONE OF OUR- WONDERFUL HOSPITALS. AND THEY WERE IN THE CLOCK WAS RUNNING OUT AND THEY COULDN'T GET THROUGH AND YOU KNOW WHAT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT I BEEN APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU WERE WILLING. TO LISTEN TO OUR- ONCE AND THERE WERE SOME. DISCRETION USED AT LEAST NURSES ARE ARE EMPLOYED. BUT THAT'S BACKWARDS TO THE WAY THEY SHOULD BE. THE RED CARPET ARE ROLLING OUT TO THE STUDENTS. AT YOUR PLACE. WE'VE GOT TO INTERVENE AND FUNDAMENTAL THINGS. LIKE LIKE LIKE ACTUAL DUE PROCESS. IS REALLY DISCOURAGING SO I REALLY FEEL LIKE IT IN I'M GOING TO GO TO APPROVE THIS ALOT I APPRECIATE. THE WHAT IS BEEN SAID HERE WITH WITH RESPECT TO THE- BUT OVER REACH OF THE. THEY ARE IN BUT I THINK. IT'S COMPLICATED I UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS BUT LET'S NOT LET COMPLICATION GET IN THE WAY OF THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION HERE. IN A FREE SOCIETY IN A FREE ECONOMY IN A FREE STATE. TO THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE RIGHT TO PROCEED FORWARD AND GET THEIR LICENSES IN THIS STATE SO THAT THEY CAN REALIZE THEIR DREAM. AND UNFORTUNATELY I THINK WE ARE IN IS STANDING IN THEIR WAY AND I HOPE THIS AUDIT WILL CLEAR THE WAY AND HELP. I THINK THE STEW. COULD NOT ASK FOR WHAT THEY'RE DOING FIND A SLOT AND BE ABLE TO GET ON WITH THEIR PASSION AND GET ON WITH THEIR CALLING. RIGHT. YOUR WITHOUT WILL JUST CENTER MORE LOCKED INTO ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD THEN TO ASSEMBLY WOMAN BERNHARDT. DOCTOR MORRIS YES SIR I HAVE A QUESTION. FIRST WELCOME. YOU MAKE YOUR OPENING REMARKS AND ONE OF THE SITE COMMENTS WAS THAT YOU WERE IN LITIGATION BUT YOU DID NOT ELABORATE SO I'M JUST CURIOUS COULD YOU. SO. RESPECT THERE WE AGAIN WE ARE IN LITIGATION WITH ONE OF THE SCHOOLS AND SOUL. CHALLENGES AGAIN THE VOICE AUTHORITY SO. PORTION I CAN'T GO INTO DETAIL. WITH THAT IF WITH THAT LITIGATION IS SO IT'S SCHOOL VERSES BE ARE IN AND THAT'S IT. IN A NUTSHELL. YES SO THEN WHY DID YOU MENTION IT. BECAUSE IT AGAIN GOING INTO DETAILS OF THE LITIGATION AND IT COULD POSSIBLY INFLUENCE THE POTENTIAL EMPLOYEES THE AUDITOR'S. IT'S NOT REPORT. WHAT COMES OUT OF THE LITIGATION. OKAY I'M NOT A LAWYER I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT YOU MENTION IT IT WAS ONE OF YOUR ARGUMENTS AND YES. YOU'RE NOT HELPING ME. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU BUT WITHOUT WILL MOVE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHAT. YES THANK YOU. JUST I JUST HAVE SOME CA A COUPLE QUESTIONS YOU KNOW TYPICALLY WHEN WE DO THESE AUDIT REQUESTS WE ASK THE AGENCY. FORMALLY YOU KNOW DÃ¢N SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE BASS OR DID YOU ACTUALLY READ MAKE A LETTER OF REQUEST THE AGENCY TO ANSWERS ANY QUESTION YOU'RE ASKING. NOT BETTER WE'VE BEEN ENCOMPASSES IS BECAUSE OF THE ALL THAT I HAD ALREADY ORIGINALLY. DURING THE YEAR SO NO THERE IS NOT A FORMAL LETTER. OKAY JUST WANTED TO UNDERSTAND THAT IS TYPICALLY TE. WAY WE DO THINGS SO DID YOU GET ANY FEEDBACK. I KNOW WHAT I GOT WAS AND THAT'S HOW WE DO IT. CITING THE AND THEN THERE ARE THIRTY TO DO SO. I WOULD AGREE WITH SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES THAT WHILE THERE MAY NOT BE A GROSS ENOUGH AMOUNT OF A SHORTAGE OF NUMBERS. THERE CERTAINLY IS OUR CHALLENGES AND CERTAIN REGIONAL AREAS CENTRAL VALLEY IS OF SIGNIFICANT CONCERN THE INLAND EMPIRE IS A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN. THE NORTH COAST IS OF SIGNIFICANT CONCERN AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET PEOPLE PEOPLE BEAR SO I GUESS PART OF I AM CONFLICTED HERE QUITE FRANKLY I HAVE. TWO OF MY NURSING PRO. TO OUR OFFICE THE ITEM. THAT THAT REBELS ME. BUT ALSO. YOUR STAND THAT THERE MAY BE VALUABLE INFORMATION COMES FROM THIS AUDIT BUT- WE HAVE ANOTHER PROCESS CALLED SUNSET REVIEW. AND THAT'S COMING SOON. AND BACK GIVE OUR- FOLKS IN THE CAPITAL AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY TAKE A DEEP DIVE INTO SOME THINGS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. YOU MIGHT HAVE INFORMATION COME OUT AND AUDIT. BUT THE REALITY IS THE SUNSET REVIEW HAS ACTUALLY THE AUTHORITY IN THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE CHANGE. OR TO MOVE THINGS FORWARD SO. I KIND OF FEEL A BIT OF WRITTEN IN C. YOU MIGHT THE JUMP START BY GETTING SOME INFORMATION BUT THE SUNSET REVIEW PROCESS IS GOING TO PLAY OUT. I'M AND THAT WILL BEGIN THE PREPARATION FOR THAT WILL BEGIN I BELIEVE NEXT YEAR. SO AM I AM CONFLICTED AND OUT BY THAT I AM OBVIOUSLY HAD BEEN A HUGE PROPOSED FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BUT ALSO WONDER TOO IT'S PART OF THIS ISSUE AND I DON'T KNOW. I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON THE BOARD'S AUTHORITY ON THIS. BUT YOU WONDER YOU KNOW. WHEN SHE IS. ARE THERE ARE THERE CLINICAL SO THAT'S TO PUT. SO FOR EXAMPLE. A RESIDENCY PROGRAMS HERE IN CALIFORNIA FOR TENNIS RIGHT NOW. FOR FAMILY PRACTICE RESIDENCIES AND PRIMARY CARE. AND THERE REALLY AREN'T A LOT OF SLOTS FOR THOSE RESIDENCY PROGRAMS. PART BECAUSE THEY ARE HUGELY EXPENSIVE. THERE HE IS EXPENSIVE TO RUN AND TO MAINTAIN. SO HOSPITALS IN AND PLACES THAT ARE GOING TO BE PLATE IT PARTICIPATE IN THE EDUCATION NURSES. I JUST DON'T KNOW IF WE ARE MAXED OUT ON THAT OR IF THERE IS IF THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH THAT AND THAT IS THAT WHY THE BOARD BUT BOARD IS ENTERTAINING. BUT I DO BELIEVE THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WOULD ALSO COME OUT AND SET TO REVIEW. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT. BECAUSE YOU ARE CORRECT BUT THE I DID WOULD IDENTIFY THAT IT. AYE AND SUB ONE A WITH YOU WE'VE ALWAYS PUSHED FOR ADDITIONAL MONIES SPECIFIC IN THE AND THEN OUR CASE FOR DOCTORS ON TO BE PLAYED AND I THINK THAT THE AUDITOR CAM. A GROUP. OF BETTER INTEREST. OF ISN'T AN. BOB WHAT I. NUMBER OF THE SUB COMMITTEE AND- SERVICES TO PUSH FOR ADDITIONAL MONIES AND- MEMBER OF THE- PUSH FOR ADDITIONAL MONIES. TO SUPPORT SOME OF THESE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. AND FRANKLY WORK WITH THE HOSPITALS TO SEE IF WE CAN PROVIDE. MORE MORE SPOTS. AND I THINK THE AUDIT. WOULD IDENTIFY THAT I. HAVE BEEN WORKING NOW WITH THE AUDITOR FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS SITTING ON THIS COMMITTEE AND SHE'S VERY. GOOD AT NOT JUST FINDING THE AMER INFORMATION BUT ALSO GIVING RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO WHAT. IS TO BE. AND I FOUND. THAT OUR- DEPARTMENTS NEED. EXT HELP AS- GET IT OBVIOUS THEIR VIEW BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY DO ON A DAILY BASIS THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR TO LOOK AT IT WITH A FRESH VIEW AND GIVE RECOMMENDATIONS NOT ONLY TO THE DEPARTMENT BUT ALSO TO US AS LEGISLATORS PROVIDE. EASE MAYBE DIGITAL SUPPORT SIDE I. WON WERE. BEEN TEACHING FOR ADDITIONAL SLOTS FOR. AND PROVIDED THAT MONEY THAT THOSE DOCTORS ARE BEINGS OR THE POTENTIAL DOCTORS ARE BEING. HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THE CLINICAL STUDY THAT WOULD GIVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY IN SOME. TO ASK FOR ADDITIONAL MONIES FOR ADDITIONAL SLOTS FOR YOU KNOW IF THERE IS A NEED AND THE US CENTRAL VALLEY I'M FROM LA COUNTY AND I LOOKED AT THE PRESENT LA COUNTY. WE HAVE NO SHORTAGE AS A MATTER OF FACT WE HAVE AN OVERSUPPLY OVERSUPPLY OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND FIVE I REPRESENT MY. CALIFORNIA THE WHOLE AND SEE THAT IN THE SAID ABOUT. I HAVE SOME GOAL LET ME THOUSAND NURSES IN THE VALLEY FOUR THOUSAND NURSES THERE'S SEVERAL AREAS THAT HAVEN'T I NEED AND- FOR ME IT'S ABOUT THE WHOLE STATE NOT JUST NECESSARILY MIGHT REGION AGAIN I LOVE THAT I'M IN LA COUNTY AND WE DON'T HAVE THIS ISSUE BUT I HAVE BEEN VISITING THE CENTRAL VALLEY I VISITED WITH SOME FARMERS YESTERDAY. THOSE FARMERS DON'T THE CROP WORKERS DON'T HAVE ACCESS FOR VARIOUS BRANDS AND ONE OF THE REASONS IS THAT THERE IS NOT ENOUGH ACCESS AND PART OF THAT ACTS AS A- OF THE- BACK OF. THE END AND YOU POINT OUT REALLY GOOD THINGS AND I DON'T DISAGREE WITH ANY OF THAT BUT HOW DO YOU GET PEOPLE. TO THOSE COMMUNITIES. HOW DO YOU GET WELL TRAINED IN THOSE COMMUNITIES BIG. AND ACT AS A SHIP FROM UP OUR WAY. PROGRAM AS A TEACHER AND WORKED FOR FIVE YEARS AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY PART OF MY FINANCIAL. THAT WAS WAS RELIEVED WITH THAT UPPER GRAND SO THAT WOULD GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO PERHAPS DO A GRANT LIKE THAT FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES IF THEY MOVED INTO THIS COMMUNITIES AND PROVIDE THE ACCESS FOR THEM IS OUT OF SCOPE OF THE AUDIT BUT IT IS OUT OF SCHOOL BUT THE ADDED BUT AGAIN WITH THE I DID WE WOULD FIND OUT SPECIFICALLY WHAT'S HAPPENING. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO PUSH FOR EXAMPLE TO BOB PROVIDED IN A MONIES I SEE IT AS AN UP OVERVIEW OF EVERYTHING HOW ARE WE GOING TO PROVIDE NURSES FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES AND THE ODD IT WOULD AT LEAST GIVE US THE BASED OUT OF WHAT THE PROBLEMS ARE AND IF THERE'S NO PROBLEMS THEN THEN. I WOULD BE THE FIRST ONE TO SEND OUT OF A PRESS RELEASE TO. AND B. R. N. FOR THEIR WORK BUT IF THERE'S ISSUES THAT COME UP THAT THE AUDITOR CAN BE. TOO THEN I WOULD BE OPEN TO THAT SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE ACCESS AGAIN. NOT JUST THE TALLY COUNTY I'M FROM LA COUNTY I'M GOOD I NEIGHBORS IN THE INLAND EMPIRE NOT GOOD. AND SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ACCESS FOR ALL. AND AGAIN I MET WITH THE- FARMWORKERS YES THEY AND THEY DON'T HAVE ANY ACCESS. NOW THAT'S A WHOLE YOU'RE RIGHT IT IS OUTSIDE OF THE SCOPE OF THE AUDIT. BUT I DID. WAS CREATE EITHER LEGISLATION. GRAHAM'S THAT WOULD INCENTIVIZE THESE THESE FOLKS MAYBE FROM ALLEY. THE CENTER THAT I THINK WE MOVE TOWARDS THAT I THINK WE ALL. WANT ADDITIONAL ACCESS IS TRYING TO PROVE THAT BELIEVE MR. THING ABOUT. THE EFFORT COAST WITH. ONE IN. CONTROL. WELL REALLY DISCUSSING AND WHETHER THE SCOPE. IT WILL HELP. PRESS OF THAT WHETHER FUTURE POLICY CONCERNS AND SUB ONE ARE OF POLICY COMMITTEE OR FUTURE LEGISLATION. RIGHT WITH THAT I DON'T KNOW. QUESTION MISTER WOOD OR JUST SAY THAT YOU KNOW I PROBABLY WON'T BE SUPPORTING THE ADDED TODAY BECAUSE I BELIEVE WE HAVE ANOTHER PROCESS IS CALLED SUNSET REVIEW. AND WHICH WOULD BE UP I'M A VERY BROAD. LENGTHY PROCESS THAT WOULD GIVE THE EVERYBODY OPPORTUNITY GET A LOT OF THE ANSWERS YOU'RE ASKING FOR US I'M NOT SAYING THAT THERE'S NOT A NEED FOR MORE INFORMATION. BY THE SAME I THINK WE. ARE WE HAVE A PROCESS THAT THAT WE CAN COMPLETE YOUR- SIDE. THANKS BIRD. YOU KNOW I'M COMING OF THIS WITH A PROBABLY A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON THE FIRST DAY I WAS. INTO THE ASSEMBLY. I HAD A FOR PROFIT NURSING COLLEGE AND MY DISTRICT CLOSE. AND SO LEARNED CASE WORK UP RIGHT OFF THE BAT BEFORE I EVEN HAVE. USED TO MY DISTRICT OFFICE. AND WE HAD CONSTITUENTS THAT DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR TRANSCRIPTS. THAT COULDN'T MOVE THAT YOU KNOW THAT WOULD CARRY THE STUDENT LOAN THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO DISCHARGED ALONE. SO WHEN I LOOKED AT THIS AUDIT WHAT I LOOK THAT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE IS THAT ON A QUAN. QUESTION HOW. ARE THEY. OFFICIALLY CLOSED. NOW PLAYING THE SLOT ALL THIS STUFF. COMPLETELY LACKING FOR ME IS THE QUALITY OF THE PROGRAMS. RIGHT SO THAT'S WHAT WE KNOW. AT AND THERE MIGHT NOT BE AN OPTION TO CHANGE THE SCOPE IN WHICH CASE I'M UNFORTUNATELY CAN'T. SUPPORT THE ON IT TODAY. BUT FOR ME WE SHOULD BE REALLY LOOKING AT. YOU KNOW WHEN WE'RE ASKING THESE QUESTIONS. ARE THE COMPLAINTS COMING FROM FOR PROFIT. FIVE IT OF COTTON COLLEGES ARE THEY COMING FROM NONPROFIT PROTOCOL IS ARE THEY COMING FROM OUR PUBLIC COLLEGES WHERE THE COMPLAINTS COMING FROM. YOU KNOW WHAT WE LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF SLOTS AND WE LOOK AT THE CREDIT A YOU KNOW THE HOW HOW THE B. R. AND- EVALUATES PROGRAMS. HOWEVER THEY EVALUATING QUALITY THE COST TO THE PROGRAM YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THAT OUR FOLKS REALLY GONNA LEAVE WITH SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS. IS WHAT THEIR CONTROL OF LIFELONG EARNING IS. SO I THINK. IF WE'RE GONNA AUDIT. ABOARD WE SHOULD DO IT COMPREHENSIVELY I THINK SENATOR ROTH IS BROUGHT UP SOME HIS CONCERNS. AND I HAVE THE CONCERNED ABOUT QUALITY OF WHICH I DON'T FULLER ADEQUATELY. ON INCLUDED HERE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. THE. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SORRY I'M OVER FORTY SO I HAVE TO TAKE OFF MY GLASSES WE TALK ABOUT. SOME OF THE SLOTS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. I WONDER ABOUT THE PROVISION OF THE SLOTS AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHAT IS MENTIONED AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN AND I HAD HEARD AND THOUGH I DON'T HAVE THE IDEA VERIFY THIS. SOME PEOPLE WITH SOME ORGANIZATIONS CAN GIVE DONATIONS TO GET MORE ACCESS TO THE SPOTS HOW'S THAT AFFECTING THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. SO I THINK IF WE'RE GONNA YOU KNOW I BASICALLY THINK YOU KNOW WE SHOULD ON EVERYBODY THE STATE THAT'S LIKE MY GENERAL RULE. BUT IT'S GOING TO AUDIT THEM WE SHOULD COMPREHENSIVELY AND INCLUDES QUESTIONS FROM SENATOR ROTH SOME OF THE MONTH. THAT I HAVE A QUALITY OF PROGRAMS. MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE A PATH TO A JOB. AND IF THAT'S BEST DONE IN A COMPREHENSIVE. REVIEW FORMAT VÃ¬ THE SON OF VIA THE SUNSET REVIEW PROCESS. YOU KNOW I'LL BE THE FIRST TO HELP. YOU KNOW MAKE SURE THAT SUNSET REVIEW PROCESS IS ADEQUATE BECAUSE WE DO HAVE WE DO NEED TO HAVE MAKE SURE THAT EVERY PLACE IN OUR STATE. HAS TRAIN NURSES THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR JOBS THAT ARE REALLY. ADDING TO THE HEALTH AND OF OUR COMMUNITIES SO I APPLAUD THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD IN THE SENSE THAT. YOU BROUGHT THIS TO A CRITICAL MOMENT WE'RE ALL WATCHING IT BUT I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A SCOPE HERE THAN. WHAT'S ACTUALLY BEEN BEEN DISK. THANK YOU IT ALMOST TENER MINING. IN MY DISTRICT HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS FROM PEOPLE BEEN HELD UP IN THE LICENSING PROCESS SOME FROM OUT OF STATE WHO COME INTO CALIFORNIA OTHERS WHO GRADUATED FROM OUR INSTITUTIONS. AND OTHERS IN ON IT AND TWENTY SIXTEEN I BELIEVE ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND THAT THERE HAS BEEN IMPROVEMENT OF BACKLOG IN IN FORWARD PROGRESS AND I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY THINK THE BOARD FOR. THAT I DO SHARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS. RAISED BY DR WOODS IN OTHERS. ABOUT THE SCOPE OF THIS ON IT IN THE TIMING. I THINK IT THE CORN IN ASSEMBLY MEMBER HAVE TOUCHED ON. I THINK WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS SOME CONFLICT BETWEEN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS OR PRIVATE PROGRAMS SOME OF THE CONCERN WE'VE SEEN WITH SOME PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS I KNOW SOME DO AN AMAZING JOB AND OTHERS MAYBE. NOT IS GREAT QUALITY BUT SHOULDERING SOME STUDENTS WITH DEBT. ENDS RUNNING BUSINESSES AND SERVE FOR ME QUALITY IS THE NUMBER ONE CONCERN OF WHETHER IT'S PUBLIC OR PRIVATE INSTITUTION I THINK THE BOARD HAS A ROLE TO PLAY. IN A- THEIR THE GATE KEEPER FOR QUALITY. I'VE ALSO RECEIVED OPPOSITION TO THIS AUDIT FROM AT LEAST THREE COMMUNITY COLLEGES OR INSTITUTIONS IN MY DISTRICT NURSE PROGRAM. ORGANIZED LABOR ON THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION IS PROVIDED ME WITH A LIST OF ALTERNATIVE QUESTIONS OR SUPPLEMENTAL QUESTIONS AND I KNOW WE DON'T USE THIS HEARING TO EXPAND THE SCOPE OF THE AUDIT. BUT WHAT I WOULD ASK THROUGH THE CHAIR IS IF WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR THE AUTHOR. I'M IN THE AUDITOR TO LOOK AT THESE QUESTIONS AND SEE IF THEY ARE WITHIN THE SCOPE OF WHAT YOU HAVE ARTICULATED ENDS IN POTENTIALLY INCORPORATE THE SPIRIT OF THESE THAT ARE WITH THE IN THE SCOPE OF THE CURRENT AUDIT SHOULD RECEIVE THE VOTES TODAY. ON IN AGAIN. YOU'RE WELCOME TO COMMENTS ARE NOT THAT'S KIND OF THE SPIRIT THOUGH OF MINE QUESTION WOULD BE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF WHAT YOU'RE ASKING IF THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE AUDITOR. ALREADY PROPOSED. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE ABSOLUTELY ORANGE. CNA AND WHOEVER HAS A PERSPECTIVE ON THE ON THIS PARTICULARWATER REQUEST IF THERE ARE QUESTIONS THAT CNN PROVIDED TO YOU SEE AN EXCUSE ME INVITED TO YOU SEE AN AD PROVIDED YOU. THAT WE BELIEVE WOULD FIT IN THE SCOPE OF A AND WOOD ESSENTIALLY ASSIST US IN CONDUCTING THE ANALYSIS WERE ABSOLUTELY. THING TO DO THAT THERE MAY BE SOME QUESTIONS THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE SCOPE WE WOULDN'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY. IF THE COMMITTEE APPROVES THE REQUEST TO ADD THOSE NOW WE DO HAVE A WE ALWAYS INCLUDE AN ADDITIONAL OBJECTIVE WHERE WE WOULD ASSESS ISSUES THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT TO THE AUDIT SO WE MAY BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION. BUT AGAIN I DON'T WANT TO GO BEYOND. AUTHORITY OF THIS MOVING THE AUDIT SO I WOULD WANT SURE THERE'S AT LEAST A NEXUS RAY YOU WHAT ASSEMBLYMEMBER RUBIO IS ASKING US TO DO. AND I HATE THAT IN. FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT THE GUIDELINES IN IN GUARD RAILS BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S AN OPEN MIND TO LOOKING AT THESE MEN AND I'M SEEING AND NOT FROM THE AUTHORS WELL. SO HAVING SAID ALL THAT I DON'T KNOW THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE REQUEST TODAY BUT I DO APPRECIATE THE OPENNESS TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION CONCERNS AS APPROPRIATE WITHIN THE SCOPE. OF THE PROPOSED ON IT. SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK CENTER MINING AND LOADS US QUATRE HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE TO SEE THESE IF NOT WE'LL GET NOW. MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU WITHOUT OF TO. LISTEN TO YOUR GONZALEZ. I WANT TO THANK A YOU CAN OF COURSE ASSEMBLYMAN ASSEMBLY WOMAN REVIEW. OF FOR BRING THIS ITEM FORWARD. EARLIER TODAY I. VOTED AGAINST IN ITEM THAT YOU INVOLVED IN AUDIX I DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS. AN OF CONTROVERSY OR OR A SUSPICION OF CONTROVERSY THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR A RIGHT ISSUE TO BE LOOKED INTO. THIS HOWEVER IS. PROBABLY RIGHT IN FACT EVEN OVER RIGHT ARE REPRESENTING THE CENTRAL VALLEY I THINK EVERYONE STANDS BASED THE COMMENTS YOU FOR. THE DIRE SHORTAGE THAT WE HAVE. THE PROSPECTS OF TALENT LEAVING THE DIFFICULTY OF ATTRACTING CULTIVATING WE'VE MADE SOME IMPROVEMENTS WITH UCSF WITH SOME OF THE OTHER NURSING PROGRAMS AND IN MEDICAL EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE HAVE IN THE VALLEY. BUT WE'RE NOT EVEN CLOSE TO ACTUALLY MAKING THE STRONG A STAND IN. FOR THE NEEDS THAT WE HAVE IN THE FUTURE. I LOOK UPON THIS AS NOT TOO DISSIMILAR TO SOME OF THE DEBATES THAT WE HAD WITH THE BAR ASSOCIATION. I WILL MAKE CERTAIN THAT WE DON'T EVER LET TORY ALYSSUM GET IN THE WAY OF PROGRESS. IF WE'RE IN THE INDUSTRY OF PROVIDING LEGAL EDUCATION OR FOR IN THE INDUSTRY PROVIDING MEDICAL EDUCATION. THE ULTIMATE MISSION IS TO PROVIDE SERVICE AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR EVERYONE. WE ARE SUFFERING IN OUR AREA AND IF THERE'S A WAY OF IN IN IMPROVING THE AMOUNT OF SKILLED WORKERS SKILLED STAFF. I'M IN THERE IS THAT DIRECT NEXUS THAT WE'VE SEEN BASS THE REPORTS I TOOK A LOOK AT BEFORE. I THINK WE SHOULD EMBRACE IT AND I AND I COMMEND THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN FOR SAYING IF THIS AUDIT DOES NOT LEAD TO. A STRONG POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE NECESSARY WORKERS. AND CAL. THEN SHE'LL BE WRITING YOU. A LETTER COMMENDING YOU FOR THE WORK THAT IT THAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING. BUT LET'S NOT EVER LET IT. HELP ME DONE THINGS IN THE PAST KEEP US FROM IMPROVING AND WE SEEM TO HAVE CHANGES WITH THE BAR ASSOCIATION. HELPING SO I THINK THAT I BE PUT PLEASE TO SUPPORT ON THIS ITEM IN HOPES THAT THERE ARE WAYS THAT WE CAN IMPROVE THE STUDENT POPULATION AS WELL AS THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION THE CENTER MONNING I AND OUR ASSEMBLY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED BEFORE I THINK THEY DO GO HAND IN HAND BUT FIRST WE GOT TO GET THE SKILLED LABOR FORCE TO THE SCHOOL SYSTEMS. IN IN THE WORK FORCE. THANK YOU WITHOUT MOVED TO CENTER CONSOLE. S. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR EVERYBODY'S COMMENTS AND THINK YOU'RE SOME REMEMBER RUBIO FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AS WELL. SO ALSO COMING FROM LA COUNTY I THINK WHERE I HAVE A BIT OF A CONFLICT WITH THIS AUDIT IS THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY NELLY COUNTY AS WE TALKED ABOUT THE SHORTAGE. NURSES IS THE SHORTAGE OF CLINICAL SPOTS AS THE OF MY- COLLEAGUES HAVE MENTIONED AS WELL AND I KNOW THAT. SPECIFICALLY WITH LONG BEACH THE AREA I REPRESENT COMING FROM THAT LENDS. A LONG WHICH CITY COLLEGE WROTE IN OPPOSITION THERE WERE EIGHT NURSING PROGRAM BUT VERY FEW SLOW. IN THE AREA. AND MAYBE IT MAYBE IS THERE AN ADN PROGRAM A FEW DIFFERENT ELEMENTS BUT- THEY'RE VEHEMENTLY OPPOSE. BECAUSE THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. MORTGAGE HOSPITAL SITE IS SLEEP. ANY I'M SPOT HERE AND IS IT UP BUT I WOULD SAY IS THE- YOU KNOW IT WITH LONG BEACH IN ADDITION TO HAVING A DÃ¢N PROGRAM AND THE SHORTAGE OF SLOTS WE ALSO THE HOSPITAL CLOSURE WHICH ADDS AND COMPOUNDS TO THE ISSUE. AND SO FOR ME IT'S A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO SUPPORT AUDIT WHERE WE HAVE YOU KNOW A MULTITUDE OF ISSUES TO THINK ABOUT AND CARDS TO THAT. I AM SO WHAT I WOULD JUST SAY IS YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO UP AND WORK CLOSELY WITH SENSIBLE PROGRAMS THAT WE OF COURSE TO STREAMLINE AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING. SLOTS IN AREAS LIKE LA COUNTY AND THEN ALSO LOOK AT SHORTAGE IS FOR NURSING AND OTHER AREAS LIKE CENTRAL VALLEY SO I THINK THERE'S A WHOLE MIX OF IS THAT WE HAVE TO. DO THAT I THINK. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE COMPREHENSIVELY. AND GAUGE WHEN I THAT WE CAN DO FIRST. START HEADING INTO AN AUDIT THAT MAIL TACKLE ONE SPECIFIC ISSUE. SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THIS THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AS WELL. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU TURNING BACK TO THE DÃ­AS OF. UNSEEN TAXES MOSTLY SURE I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I DON'T SPEAK FOR THE PROPONENT OF THIS REQUEST AND I CERTAINLY DIDN'T DRAFTED BUT ISSUE NUMBER FIVE CALLS FOR OF THE AUDITOR TO REVIEW AND IDENTIFY THE PROCESS THAT THE BEER AND USES TO EVALUATE CLINICAL DISPLACEMENT IT CETERA SO THERE IS A CLINICAL DISPLACEMENT ISSUE WHICH I ASSUME MADAM AUDITOR WILL ALSO INCLUDE AN EVALUATION WHETHER THEY'RE SHORT CLINICAL SLOTS WHERE THE COURAGE IS THE REASON FOR THE SHORTAGES. IF ALL UP YOU KNOW I THINK THERE'S AN AT THERE'S BEEN APPS THERE'S A LOT OF IT TOTAL INFORMATION FLOATING AROUND BUT I THINK WE NEED TO DRILL DOWN. BELOW THE ANTIDOTE AND GET TO THE- TO THE REAL FACT AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S A SHORTAGE OR WHETHER THIS IS JUST AN URBAN LEGEND. AND IT MAY VERY WELL BE THAT THEIR SHORTAGES THEY MAY BE REGIONAL TO MAYBE NOT BUT I WOULD I WOULD EXPECT THAT THAT ISSUE TO BE SQUARE IT TO GO TO MY- COLLEAGUES POINTS I WOULD EXPECT THAT TO BE SQUARELY ADDRESSED IN THIS AUDIT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU. THIS TIME. FOR QUESTIONS FROM DÃ­AS WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT. SQUARE PUBLIC COMMENT AT THIS TIME IF YOU CAN PLEASE. APPROACH INDICATE YOUR NAME IF YOU'RE AFFILIATED WITH AN ORGANIZATION IF NOT. WHICH SCHOOL OR COUNTY RESIDED IN WHETHER YOU ARE IN SUPPORT. OR OPPOSITION TO THE AUDIT IF YOU COULD PLEASE LIMIT YOUR COMMENTS TO LESS THAN TWO MINUTES THE CITY WOULD APPRECIATE THAT. PLEASE HE'D LIKE TO BEGIN. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GEORGE MILLER ON BEHALF OF WESTERN GOVERNORS UNIVERSITY A NOT FOR PROFIT NURSING SCHOOL. WE DO SUPPORT THE AUDIT WE DO SUPPORT THE NEUTRAL. PARTY BEING THE STATE AUDITOR TAKING A LOOK AT THESE QUESTIONS IN TRYING TO RESOLVE SOME OF THESE ISSUES SAID OF BEEN. OF CONCERN FOR A WHILE I KNOW I DON'T THINK ANYBODY IN THE NOT FOR PROFIT OR OTHER AND PRIVATE NURSING SCHOOL SECTOR. WOULD DISAGREE THAT IF THERE ARE SLOTS AVAILABLE AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT THAT'S PROBABLY THE BEST ROUTE THAT'S THE LEAST EXPENSIVE ROUTE IT USUALLY WERE CLOSEST TO THE TO THE INDIVIDUAL THAT WANTS TO GET AN EDUCATION AND IF IT WORKS FOR THEIR DAILY LIFE. THAT IS GOOD BUT IN OFTENTIMES THAT ISN'T THE CASE WG WAS. WAS ASKED TO COME TO CALIFORNIA TO WORK AND A LOT. AND NOW OFTENTIMES ARE RESPECT. ACTUALLY COME FROM THE HOSPITALS THEMSELVES THEY HAVE STUDENTS THAT THEY WERE THEY HAVE EMPLOYEES THAT ARE AT THE HOSPITALS THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO. BECOME NURSES THEY'RE ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH THE HOSPITAL SYSTEMS BECAUSE THEY'VE WORKED THERE. AND THE ISSUE IS WE CAN'T GET. APPROVAL WE'VE HAD THE HOSPITALS THEMSELVES A CHIEF NURSING OFFICER SIGN OFF THAT IT WILL NOT DISPLACE ANY CURRENT. COHORTS OF STUDENTS FROM COMMUNITY COLLEGES OR OTHERWISE AND WE STEUBENVILLE BEEN DENIED AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AS FEW AS TEN STUDENTS. AND THESE ARE REAL PEOPLE THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT THE HOSPITALS THEMSELVES HAVE IDENTIFIED THAT WOULD BECOME THAT WOULD BE GOOD NURSES. AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THE SUPPORT FOR THIS I ALSO BELIEVE. YOU WANT TO GET NURSES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY OR YOU WANT TO GET A MODOC COUNTY YOU NEED TO EDUCATE NURSES. WHERE THEY LIVE AND THEY WILL BE MORE LIKELY TO STAY THERE JUST LIKE EDUCATORS AND I THINK. FOR PROGRAMS LIKE OURS WE HAVE THAT CAPABILITY IF WE CAN GET. RULES FROM THE BRN THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT PLEASE. MISTER CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR MEMBERS AND CURTIS LAYING FRAUGHT WITH THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION A CNA AS OPPOSED TO THIS AUDIT REQUEST BECAUSE IT IS AN ATTEMPT BY PRIVATE NURSING SCHOOLS TO MISUSE THE J. LACK PROCESS A LOT PROCESS FOR THEIR OWN GAINS BY PRESENTING OGDEN QUESTIONS THAT WOULD YOUR- ANSWERS TO FIT THEIR OWN PURPOSES. BOB WE BELIEVE THAT PART THAT PURPOSE IS TO. OUR IN ANY ROAD ITS ABILITY TO PROTECT NURSING STUDENTS IN OUR PATIENTS. THIS IS JUST THE LATEST ATTEMPT TO ACHIEVE THIS AND FIRST THERE WAS LEGISLATION BY THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS WHICH WOULD HAVE THE REGULATED. NURSING EDUCATION THAT BILL DIED IN ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS THEN. THEY FILED A MASSIVE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST IN A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE B. R. AND- NOW WE HAVE THIS AUDIT REQUEST. INSTEAD CNA HAS SUBMITTED ALTERNATIVE AUDIT QUESTIONS TO THE AUTHOR WHICH WE BELIEVE MORE DIRECTLY ADDRESSES THE ISSUES SURROUNDING CLINICAL PACE PLACEMENTS AND YOU SHOULD HAVE THEM THERE BEFORE YOU. THOSE QUESTIONS THE JUSTIFICATION LARA IS FALSE ASSERTION THAT CALIFORNIA'S BUSINESS WHY NURSING SHORTAGE WHICH IS BASED ON ALAR STUDY. THAT USE A CRUDE CASTING METHODS. AND IS SHORTAGE NUMBERS WERE IN TO BE IMPOSSIBLE. STEAD AS LEARNED HERE TODAY THERE ARE REGIONAL POCKETS WHERE AB SHORTAGES BUT THE AREAS WHERE THE LARGEST PRIVATE NURSING PROGRAMS ARE CONCENTRATED ARE ACTUALLY AREAS OF SURPLUS. SO IN ROAMING GROWTH IN THOSE AREAS AS A DIRECT IMPACT ON WHETHER STUDENTS GET CLINICAL PLACEMENTS. OF THE B. R. IN THE STATUTORILY REQUIRED TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC NOT TO PROMOTE THE FINANCIAL INTEREST OF PRIVATE CORPORATIONS OR CORPORATE ENTITIES. AND ACTUALLY HOSPITALS ARE ACTUALLY CONTROL AND SET THE NUMBER OF CLINICAL PLACEMENTS LOTS. PUBLIC UNIQUE COMMUNITY COLLEGE NURSING PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN DISPLACED FROM CLINICAL SITES BY HOSPITALS SO THAT RAPIDLY EXPANDING PROPERTY PROGRAMS COULD YOU THOSE SITES FOR THEIR STUDENTS. FACT 27% A PRIVATE INCORRECT STATE. ARE FROM ONE PRIVATE SCHOOL. LET ME BE CLEAR WITH ALL DUE RESPECT THE HARD WORK NURSING STUDENTS HERE TODAY WE ARE NOT TRYING TO GET RID OF PRIVATE NURSING PROGRAMS AS AN ALTERNATIVE. BUT SEE IN THE CNA BELIEVES IN THE NEED TO SUPPORT MORE AFFORDABLE PUBLIC EDUCATION RATHER THAN PUSHING AN ALTERNATIVE THAT CAN COST NEARLY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND PUT STUDENTS IN SUBSTANTIAL DEBT. WE WOULD LIKE TO ALSO NOTE THAT PUBLIC SCHOOLS DO NOT HAVE THE FUNDS THAT PRIVATE SCHOOLS HAVE TO CLOSE SOME OF THESE GAPS IN CERTAIN AREAS WHERE THERE ARE GAPS. WE NEED TO MAKE PUBLIC POLICY TO SUPPORT PUBLIC SCHOOLS. AS A PRIORITY. STUDENTS ENROLLED IN PUBLIC NURSING PROGRAMS ARE MORE DIVERSE. MORE OFTEN THE FIRST IN THEIR FAMILIES TO ATTEND COLLEGE AND MORE LIKELY TO BE FROM UNDER REPRESENTED IN AND UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS. WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST FOR YOUR NO VOTE ON THIS AUDIT. HI THANK YOU AND I BELIEVE SOME OF THE QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. LONG AS THEY DON'T CHANGE THE SCOPE. OF THE AUDIT THE AUDITOR WILL TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION IF I GET HAVE EVERYBODY PLEASE BE MORE SIX WITH YOUR COMMENTS. YOU'RE SUPPORTING AND OPPOSING WOULD APPRECIATE IT PLEASE I'LL BE A LEASE MARGARET ON BEHALF. FACULTY ASSOCIATION WE ARE OPPOSED TO DAUGHTER WELL ON OUR THAT'S WHERE I CALL FROM CNH. REAL REGARD.

AS A COMMUTE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE NURSING PROGRAMS ALL OF WHOM WERE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS AUDIT. OF CALIFORNIA. I HAD A LOT OF OTHER REMARKS TO THEM BASED ON YOUR QUESTIONS I HAVE TO SAY I NEED TO CHANGE THEM. SIX OUR AND WORKFORCE IN CALIFORNIA'S COMES FROM THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE BEEN CLINICALLY DISPLACED BY PRIVATE FOR PROFIT NURSING PROGRAMS WHO ARE REALLY THE AUTHOR IN THE IMPETUS BEHIND THIS BILL AN ADJUSTER CORRECT A COUPLE PEOPLE HAVE STATED THERE IS A UP THERE ARE OPENINGS IN THE INLAND EMPIRE I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT IT'S NOT TRUE THEY'RE NOT OPENING THE INLAND EMPIRE THE LET EMPIRE BECAUSE A- FULL. A NURSE FORCE. ALLEN REJECTED IT WILL HAVE A SURPLUS OF NURSES IN L'EMPIRE THE SHORTAGES ARE LARGELY RELATED TO THE- CENTRAL VALLEY I THINK THAT THE ISSUE AS I THINK SAN FRANCISCO IS ANOTHER AREA I WANT TO SAY. AGAIN IT'S ANOTHER AREA OF I'M UP NORTH I CAN'T REMEMBER BUT THOSE AREAS NEEDS INCENTIVE TO GET PEOPLE TO GO TO THOSE AREAS AS OPPOSED TO RAMPING UP IN THE NOT AREAS WHICH ARE JUST. JEAN COMMUNITY COLLEGE NURSING PROGRAMS SOME PROGRAM AS ONE OF THIS IS AS ONE OF THE. SOME WOMEN SENATORS POINTED OUT IT IS 50% OF THEIR- CLINICAL SPACES WERE LOST A FOR PROFIT NURSING PROGRAMS. COMMUNITY COLLEGES COST SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS COST TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. PRIVATE FOR PROFITS COST A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. THE ATTRITION RATE WHICH IS PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE ON THE B. R. AND WEBSITE AT THE LARGEST FOR PROFIT PROGRAM IS 25% ATTRITION. THAT MEANS ONE OUT OF FOUR OF THOSE P. A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS YOUR DATA. PLEASE OKAY. I RESPECTFULLY WOULD ASK YOU ALL TO OPPOSE THIS THE SUNSET REVIEW CAN TAKE CARE OF THE MATTER THANK YOU VERY MAKE YOU. ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT PLACE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS TOM CAN SEE ON BEHALF OF YOU A W. TWENTY EIGHT SIXTY FIVE REPRESENTING ACADEMIC STUDENT EMPLOYEES THAT YOU SEE.

I USED CALIFORNIA AND THE- NURSE ALLIANCE OF CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND NURSES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I AM A PROUD ADN GRADUATE I WENT TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE IT TOOK ME FIVE YEARS IT WAS WORTH EVERY SECOND. MY DAUGHTER WENT TO NURSING SCHOOL TO WATER THE LOOK AT A PRIVATE. IT WAS GONNA COST OR EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO GET HER AT AND I TOLD HER NO. TOOK HER A LONG TIME SHE GOT AN ASSOCIATE'S DEGREE AT RIVERSIDE CITY COLLEGE SO. I AM A HUGE SUPPORTER OF THE PUBLIC SYSTEM WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH POSITIONS FOR THE QUALIFIED APPLICANTS. MY GOOD OLD. FRIEND MEETINGS ALMOST ONE OF THEM EVERY MONTH SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND NINE OR- TEN. AND STE. THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE TELLING US THAT THEY'RE SHUTTING PROGRAMS DOWN. THERE THERE ARE LIKE CUTTING THEIR ENROLLMENT FOR THEIR ELIMINATING A WHOLE SEMESTER WORTH OF NURSING PROGRAM ROLE MINUTES BECAUSE OF THE CLINICAL DISPLACEMENT. SERVICE. THE BEER IN THIS ADDRESSING SOME OF THESE ISSUES THEY'VE DONE REGIONAL SUMMITS WHERE THEY'VE HAD STAKEHOLDERS COME TO MEETINGS TO TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT HAVE WORKFORCE MEANS THROUGH KNEE WALK WHICH I AM A PROUD MEMBER OF THAT WORKING COMMITTEE TO ADDRESS THE WORK FORCE BUT THEY'RE WORKING ON THESE ISSUES I THINK THAT WE CAN DO IT THROUGH A SUNSET REVIEW I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO CORRECT WE ARE A PROUD SUPPORTER OF THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING HAVE BEEN FOR DECADES WE DON'T ALWAYS AGREE AND WE ALWAYS HAVE SOME CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM. BUT I THINK WE'RE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND SO WE RESPECTFULLY ASK ASK FOR YOUR VOTE AND WE DO HAVE A LETTER OF OPPOSITE. THANK YOU. NOT PUBLIC COMMENT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MITCH SNIDER WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO THE ON IT FOR THE REASONS AND QUESTIONS PREVIOUSLY STATED WE WOULD ALSO JUST EMPHASIZE THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING IS ROLAND PUBLIC PROTECTION PRETTY CLEARLY IDENTIFIED IN THE BNP CODE AS THEIR PRIMARY MISSION AND WE WOULD STRONGLY ARGUE THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT THEY'RE DOING BY ALIGNING THE NUMBER OF NURSES TRAINED WITH AN AVAILABLE SLOTS BECAUSE A BIG PART OF. LEARNING TO BE AN EFFECTIVE NURSE IS THAT DIRECT PATIENT CARE EXPERIENCE AND THE MORE THAT WE TRAIN NURSES BEYOND THEIR BEING ACTUAL SLOTS FOR THEM THE MORE THAT WE RISK HARMING THAT COMPONENT OF THE NURSE EDUCATION PROCESS AND SO FOR THAT REASON UNDERSTOOD THAT AND THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY DIRECTLY AFFECT THAT BUT THE SUFFIX OF THIS ONE SO THE CIRCUMSTANCES AROUND IT SCHEME DESIGNED. IT WAS TOWARD THAT GOAL AND SO WE WOULD URGE OTHER A TO REJECT AUDIT START FIND OTHER. GETTING TO THE SAME. NO PROBLEM IS.

I'M ALSO THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF THE COLLEGES OF NURSING WHICH REPRESENT THE PUBLIC AND THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS ACROSS THE STATE. I STAND IN SUPPORT OF THIS AUDIT. I WANT TO MAKE IT A GOOD FOLLOW UP TO SOME OF THE KEY QUESTIONS WERE RAISED EARLIER AROUND QUALITY OF EDUCATION. I BRING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF EXPERTISE AS IT RELATES TO ACCREDITATION. AND ASSESSING AND EVALUATING OF THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION THAT HAPPENS THROUGH NATIONAL NURSING ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE COMMISSION OF KERR ON KLAY DID NURSING EDUCATION OUT OF IT YOU SEE IN. IN WASHINGTON DC WHO REPORT UP TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. WHAT THE BOARD DOES TOWARDS COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATIONS THAT'S NOT THE HALLMARK OF HOW HIGHER RED. X. THE INSURERS THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION THIS IS A SUBTLE. BUT IMPORTANT DISTINCTION TO BE MADE. THE BOARDS REGULATIONS ARE FREQUENTLY NON EVIDENCE BASED FOR EXAMPLE YOU HAVE TO HAVE A YEAR'S WORTH OF DIRECT PATIENT CARE EXPERIENCE IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. TO BE QUALIFIED TO TEACH IN A PRE LICENSURE PROGRAM. I HAVE PEOPLE WITH DOCTORAL DEGREES MASTER'S DEGREES BECAUSE OUR NURSE PRACTITIONERS BUT HAVEN'T WORKED IN A HOSPITAL IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. CANNOT BE APPROVED TO BE TO TEACH I'VE BEEN A NURSE SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WITH A DOCTORAL DEGREE. I HAVE REPORTED TO THE BOARD AS A DROP AS A DIRECTOR SINCE NINETEEN NINETY ONE I WAS A C. ASAP. I WAS ALSO THE UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII WHERE THERE WERE. DIDN'T THE SLIP OVER. AND WE DID JUST FINE. NOW THAT I MET YOU U. S. WE ARE STRUGGLING THE OVERSIGHT OF THE BOARD. IT FEELS LIKE MICRO MANAGEMENT WE FEEL HEMMED IN WE FEEL RESTRICTED AND WITH THE PROMULGATION OF REGULATION WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY. TO INFLUENCE INTO INTO SHIFTED SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE VALUE WE'VE BEEN IN LOTS OF DISCUSSION WITH THE BOARD ABOUT THIS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. AND WE HAVEN'T WRITING AND WE DON'T GET RESPONSES. WE STRUGGLED TREMENDOUSLY WITH THIS THE WHOLE ISSUE ROOM CLINICAL DISPLACEMENT IS MEMBER ROTH MENTION WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OF B. S. AND PREPARE NURSES IN THE STATE ONLY SIXTY POINT FOUR PERCENT. OR DELETE BSN PREPARED WE NEED MORE BE A SIMPLE PURPOSES WE WANT TO DO THIS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR EIGHTY IN COLLEAGUES. THROUGH CONCURRENT ENROLLMENT PATTERNS. THE ISSUE OF CLINICAL DISPLACEMENT HAS BEEN FOR HAS BEEN WE'VE GOT THE WRONG ISSUE ON THE TABLE TO WILL FIND WRONG SOLUTION. IT ISN'T ABOUT BEING DISPLACED A BECAUSE YOU'RE AN ATM PROGRAM IN SAN FRANCISCO I AM IN CONTACT WITH YOU SEE A STEP SAN FRANCISCO STATE AND- CAL STATE EAST BAY WERE ALL HAVE A PROBLEM. EXCELLENT THANKS TO THE BOARD FOR RAPING THE SUMMIT. WE KNOW THAT THE PROPER DIRECTION. CONSOLIDATE SACRAMENTO AND POLITICAL PLACE PLEASE SO THAT'S THE REAL ISSUE AND I MEANT TO GET YOUR TRANSPARENCY IN THIS AUDIT THANK YOU THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT.

ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT. THANK YOU MATT BACK RIBS IN THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PRIVATE POST SECONDARY SCHOOLS I THINK I THINK IT'S UNFORTUNATE THIS IS SORT OF BECOME A FOR PROFIT VERSUS NONPROFIT DEBATE THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT RIGHT SO WE'RE VERY PROUD OF OUR SCHOOLS WE HAVE GRADUATION RATES PLACEMENT RATES COHORT DEFAULT RATES THAT ARE ON PAR WITH SCHOOLS LIKE STANFORD WE HAVE HIGH PERFORMING SCHOOLS THAT ARE DELIVERING THE NURSES THAT YOU ARE ALL TALKING ABOUT THAT YOU WANT. UNFORTUNATELY WE GET TO THE ROOT OF THIS AUDIT REQUEST IS WHAT LAWS DOES THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING HAVE THAT AUTHORIZES THEM TO CONTROL THE ROMAN. THAT IS NOT A CLEAR QUESTION. NOBODY HERE THAT I HEARD FROM THE SUPPORTERS DEFENDED. BELL LAW THAT THEY BELIEVE THAT THEIR CITING GIVES THEM THAT AUTHORITY. WE NEED IN ORDER TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE BOARD TO DETERMINE IF THEY HAVE THAT AUTHORITY. HOW HAVE THEY BEEN USING IT AND IF THERE ARE OTHER BOARDS THE CONTROLLER MOMENT. WAT OF THOSE GUIDELINES. THEY DO NOT HAVE GUIDELINES FOR OUR SCHOOLS AGO AND ASKED FOR A MOMENT. IT IS A NEUTRAL REQUEST IT IMPACTS COMMUNITY COLLEGES YOU SEE SEE ISSUES FOR PROFITS IN THE SAME MANNER. IT IS NOT ADVANTAGE IN ONE SECTOR OVER THE OTHER. IS LOOKING FOR AN HONEST ASSESSMENT. WHAT RULES APPLY TO THIS BOARD AND HOW WERE THEY USING THEM. FOR A SECTOR AND EVERYBODY ELSE SO WE APPRECIATE YOUR EITHER. THANK YOU AT THE SOMEONE ASKED THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT. HEARING AND SEEING NINE I WILL TURN IT BACK TO THE DÃ­AS.
