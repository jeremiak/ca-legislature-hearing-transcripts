Good morning thank you for being

00:00:57.724 --> 00:00:59.225

It's an informational hearing --

00:01:01.027 --> 00:01:01.628
On the intersection of domestic

00:01:01.694 --> 00:01:04.964
violence and technology which

00:01:05.031 --> 00:01:05.432
was a shocker to me.

00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:07.200
When not a few months ago we

00:01:07.267 --> 00:01:09.202
found out that?

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:11.104
Well I I guess we don't think

00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:13.106
that way by project perpetrators

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:15.208
do and I'm technology is being

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:15.408
used.

00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:16.976
By to further --

00:01:17.043 --> 00:01:18.978

decided that this is an

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:29.122
important issue that we needed

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:29.422
to address.

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:30.757
And I want to think --

I'm truly honored to be a part

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:15.235
of today's discussion --

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:16.736
Let me start off by thinking

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:18.972
also the city of Biloxi for

00:02:19.038 --> 00:02:19.572
hosting today's the hearing.

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:21.508
As well as the California

00:02:21.574 --> 00:02:22.141
partnership the and the mystic

00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:23.243
violence the assembly select

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:25.011
committee on domestic violence

00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:26.746
and it's chair --

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:28.915
Chair Rubio for your leadership --

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:30.750
And all of the our committee

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:32.986
staff of for their hard work in

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:35.021
putting this event together.

00:02:35.088 --> 00:02:35.588
All domestic violence is a

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:37.223
problem that affects millions of

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.894
people regardless of race gender

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.862
ethnic groups socio economic

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:44.831
status sexual orientation or

00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:46.799
each.

00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:47.400
As the chair of the assembly

00:02:47.467 --> 00:02:49.035
committee on privacy and

00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:49.502
consumer protection.

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.237
I'm acutely aware that over the

00:02:51.304 --> 00:02:54.774
past decade or so we have seen

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:56.976
an increase in technology being

00:02:57.043 --> 00:02:59.479
misused. For to harass and harm

00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:00.980
individuals.

00:03:01.047 --> 00:03:03.116
In the privacy committee we deal

00:03:03.182 --> 00:03:03.616
constantly with issues

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:04.951
surrounding emerging

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:07.020
technologies.

00:03:07.086 --> 00:03:08.988
And the opportunities and

00:03:09.055 --> 00:03:13.393
challenges the section between

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.028
technology and domestic violence

00:03:15.094 --> 00:03:16.930
is no exception.

00:03:16.996 --> 00:03:18.698
Technology has an incredible

00:03:18.765 --> 00:03:21.000
power to simplify and improve

00:03:21.067 --> 00:03:23.102
our lives in so many different

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:24.904
ways. For example technology can

00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:27.140
help is better monitor our

00:03:27.206 --> 00:03:28.908
children's activities. To help

00:03:28.975 --> 00:03:31.010
keep them safe.

00:03:31.077 --> 00:03:32.845
Knowledge you can also help is a

00:03:32.912 --> 00:03:35.081
pain higher education or health

00:03:35.148 --> 00:03:37.150
care online.

00:03:37.216 --> 00:03:37.784
Knowledge you can even improve

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.118
our user experience so very

00:03:39.185 --> 00:03:41.220
other traditional technologies

00:03:41.287 --> 00:03:44.958
like phones television.

00:03:45.024 --> 00:03:46.759
All cars even our air

00:03:46.826 --> 00:03:47.327
conditioners and toasters.

00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:49.295
But the advent of social media

00:03:49.362 --> 00:03:52.832
and smart technologies such as

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:53.266
GPS and internet.

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:55.335
Connected devices has actually

00:03:55.401 --> 00:03:58.871
created new avenues for intimate

00:03:58.938 --> 00:04:02.809
partner harassment and violence.

00:04:02.875 --> 00:04:03.343
In the legislature because

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:05.345
technologies always evolving we

00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:07.113
are constantly working with

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.048
advocates and survivors. To make

00:04:09.115 --> 00:04:11.250
sure that our legal protections

00:04:11.317 --> 00:04:13.252
keep up keep up with new

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.154
technologies and new types of

00:04:15.221 --> 00:04:15.388
abuse.

00:04:15.455 --> 00:04:19.092
And as a result of these efforts

00:04:19.158 --> 00:04:19.692
we have successfully updated

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:22.895
many of our laws. To ensure that

00:04:22.962 --> 00:04:24.731
survivors of domestic violence.

00:04:24.797 --> 00:04:27.066
Are better protected. For

00:04:27.133 --> 00:04:29.102
example we have ensure that

00:04:29.168 --> 00:04:30.903
survivors can separate your

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.172
mobile accounts while still

00:04:33.239 --> 00:04:33.806
maintaining their existing cell

00:04:33.873 --> 00:04:34.741
phone numbers.

00:04:34.807 --> 00:04:40.880
We have also expressly authorize.

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:43.449
Hacking into survivors online

00:04:43.516 --> 00:04:45.118
accounts for the purposes of

00:04:45.184 --> 00:04:47.220
harming intimidating threatening

00:04:47.286 --> 00:04:48.821
what the fighting to survive --

00:04:48.888 --> 00:04:51.057
We have also enacted laws that

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:53.292
require the courts to prohibit

00:04:53.359 --> 00:04:54.994
even stream party from taking

00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:57.263
any action to obtain the

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.165
location or the address of the

00:04:59.232 --> 00:05:01.167
protective party.

00:05:01.234 --> 00:05:01.834
Now despite all these efforts it

00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:04.871
is clear that individuals who

00:05:04.937 --> 00:05:07.040
inflict harm continues. To

00:05:07.106 --> 00:05:07.573
misuse technology in the

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:12.812
harassment and abuse of others.

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:13.446
Gap between the protections we

00:05:13.513 --> 00:05:14.914
intended.

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:16.883
And the on going misuse of

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:19.118
technology invested violence

00:05:19.185 --> 00:05:21.287
cases raises certain questions

00:05:21.354 --> 00:05:22.822
specifically.

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:25.024
Are California's domestic

00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:25.625
violence prevention lost not

00:05:25.692 --> 00:05:29.395
being applied as broadly as they

00:05:29.462 --> 00:05:30.730
might be.

00:05:30.797 --> 00:05:33.166
In order new laws needed to

00:05:33.232 --> 00:05:33.433
express.

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:35.068
Expressly cover certain abusive

00:05:35.134 --> 00:05:36.836
behaviors.

00:05:36.903 --> 00:05:39.138
At the same time what are the

00:05:39.205 --> 00:05:39.739
best practices being used by

00:05:39.806 --> 00:05:41.007
organizations both public and

00:05:41.074 --> 00:05:43.209
private. To ensure that the

00:05:43.276 --> 00:05:45.044
privacy and security and of

00:05:45.111 --> 00:05:47.246
individuals are adequately

00:05:47.313 --> 00:05:49.115
protected.

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:51.084
And today I'm hopeful that will

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.052
get answers to some of those

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:53.352
questions.

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:54.954
Put another way this technology

00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:57.056
offer tools that individuals law

00:05:57.123 --> 00:05:59.092
enforcement and the courts can

00:05:59.158 --> 00:06:00.927
be used to better protect

00:06:00.993 --> 00:06:01.527
intimate partners and family

00:06:01.594 --> 00:06:03.329
members from harassment and

00:06:03.396 --> 00:06:07.233
abuse. To that end I like to

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.768
extend a sincere thank you

00:06:08.835 --> 00:06:11.404
without all of the available

00:06:11.471 --> 00:06:12.939
information I believe that the

00:06:13.005 --> 00:06:15.241
legislature will continue to lag

00:06:15.308 --> 00:06:17.076
behind the miss uses and abuses

00:06:17.143 --> 00:06:18.878
of a technology.

00:06:18.945 --> 00:06:21.013
That is why your expertise and

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.884
experiences are invaluable to us

00:06:24.951 --> 00:06:25.384
as we grapple with how.

00:06:25.451 --> 00:06:27.086
Emerging technologies inter act

00:06:27.153 --> 00:06:29.455
with domestic violence and as we

00:06:29.522 --> 00:06:31.424
try to ensure that California

00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:34.894
has the strongest laws possible

00:06:34.961 --> 00:06:35.428
to protect its residents.

00:06:35.495 --> 00:06:37.230
Redwood is absolutely crucial to

00:06:37.296 --> 00:06:39.132
the health and prosperity.

00:06:39.198 --> 00:06:41.000
Of the residents of the state so

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:43.102
with that thank you again for

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:45.171
being here and like turn it back

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:49.175
over to my colleague assembly

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:53.012
member I would be able.

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:54.747
Thank you assemblymember

00:06:54.814 --> 00:06:57.183

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.051
many times are we know that

00:06:59.118 --> 00:06:59.786
domestic violence affects people --

00:06:59.852 --> 00:07:00.920
Of all ages races --

00:07:00.987 --> 00:07:03.456
Ethnicity gender gender identity

00:07:03.523 --> 00:07:05.124
sexual orientation in income

00:07:05.191 --> 00:07:06.826
levels --

00:07:06.893 --> 00:07:07.393
There also many ways that

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.828
survivors experienced abuse and

00:07:08.895 --> 00:07:09.462
domestic violence including the

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:11.063
use of technology and I've

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:11.597
shared with many of you.

00:07:11.664 --> 00:07:14.967
Are the reason that I five to be

00:07:15.034 --> 00:07:17.103

00:07:21.507 --> 00:07:23.509
violence we had a rally in the

city of our money yesterday and

00:07:24.844 --> 00:07:26.946

Testimonials and to be on the

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:34.954
other side.

00:07:35.021 --> 00:07:37.089
Domestic abuse it's very

00:07:37.156 --> 00:07:37.390
difficult.

00:07:37.456 --> 00:07:38.858
I spoke about --

00:07:38.925 --> 00:07:41.093

For state office and there are

00:08:05.251 --> 00:08:09.155
folks that are saying that she

00:08:09.222 --> 00:08:10.790
lied about her domestic violence.

00:08:10.857 --> 00:08:12.925
Say that again.

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:16.896
The word is that --

00:08:16.963 --> 00:08:17.496
She lied about her time to buy

00:08:17.563 --> 00:08:17.797
[inaudible]

00:08:17.864 --> 00:08:19.131
Now.

00:08:19.198 --> 00:08:20.833
I completely understand why

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.969
victims of domestic violence

00:08:23.035 --> 00:08:23.336
don't comport.

00:08:23.402 --> 00:08:26.906
If somebody.

00:08:26.973 --> 00:08:27.406
With they such public.

00:08:27.473 --> 00:08:28.774
Domestic violence --

00:08:28.841 --> 00:08:31.177
Case we actually went to court

00:08:31.244 --> 00:08:31.777
and shipped in a three year

00:08:31.844 --> 00:08:33.212
restraining order so we have.

00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:33.479
Evidence.

00:08:33.546 --> 00:08:37.183
That the judge said that she was

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:38.818
a victim of domestic violence.

00:08:38.885 --> 00:08:43.022
Still people are saying.

00:08:43.089 --> 00:08:44.891
That she lied and so when that

00:08:44.957 --> 00:08:45.157
happens.

00:08:45.224 --> 00:08:47.260
I think about the support that I

00:08:47.326 --> 00:08:50.997
am able to provide for my sister.

00:08:51.063 --> 00:08:55.001
And still again to the state.

00:08:55.067 --> 00:08:57.336
Folks are saying that she lives

00:08:57.403 --> 00:08:58.905
and so it's difficult.

00:08:58.971 --> 00:09:01.107
Because she has so much support

00:09:01.173 --> 00:09:01.707
and I always think about the

00:09:01.774 --> 00:09:03.009
folks that don't have the amount

00:09:03.075 --> 00:09:07.146
of support that she does.

00:09:07.213 --> 00:09:07.847
And the folks there are locked --

00:09:07.914 --> 00:09:09.282
Can't do anything about what is

00:09:09.348 --> 00:09:11.217
happening to them the

00:09:11.284 --> 00:09:12.718
testimonial from last night was

00:09:12.785 --> 00:09:14.921
from a mother she said she was

00:09:14.987 --> 00:09:15.454
going to try to make it.

00:09:15.521 --> 00:09:17.023
Was from a mother that just lost

00:09:17.089 --> 00:09:21.394
her daughter five months ago to

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:22.929
suicide.

00:09:22.995 --> 00:09:23.529
She committed suicide because

00:09:23.596 --> 00:09:25.131
she couldn't handle.

00:09:25.197 --> 00:09:26.899
The pressure and be the abuse

00:09:26.966 --> 00:09:29.368
that she wasn't during she left

00:09:29.435 --> 00:09:30.903
behind two little kids and

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:33.105
family members that deeply

00:09:33.172 --> 00:09:38.878
deeply Dr. Five she felt lost

00:09:38.945 --> 00:09:39.445
and so the testimonial last

00:09:39.512 --> 00:09:43.082
night was so compelling --

00:09:43.149 --> 00:09:43.716
All compelling but last night

00:09:43.783 --> 00:09:45.117
was just also a demonstration of

00:09:45.184 --> 00:09:47.286
where we have not gone far

00:09:47.353 --> 00:09:49.422
enough to trying to to prevent.

00:09:49.488 --> 00:09:50.823
Domestic violence.

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:53.259
And when we started exploring

00:09:53.326 --> 00:09:58.698
the topic of cyber bullying --

00:09:58.764 --> 00:09:59.332
Domestic by do you I apparently

00:09:59.398 --> 00:10:01.267
there's and and it's difficult

00:10:01.334 --> 00:10:01.834
for me because I don't think

00:10:01.901 --> 00:10:03.569
that way by of the of users are

00:10:03.636 --> 00:10:04.937
using Alexa.

00:10:05.004 --> 00:10:09.075
And what I'm not a techie person

00:10:09.141 --> 00:10:17.116
but the be Abbas on home.

00:10:17.183 --> 00:10:17.383
Devices.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:22.755
Against their on the victim.

00:10:22.822 --> 00:10:25.391
By either blasting the music at

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:25.958
five o'clock in the morning

00:10:26.025 --> 00:10:27.326
turning up the air or turned

00:10:27.393 --> 00:10:29.161
down you know just really.

00:10:29.228 --> 00:10:31.130
Make it uncomfortable for them

00:10:31.197 --> 00:10:35.034
and somebody said yeah.

00:10:35.101 --> 00:10:37.136
Back if you'll plug it they're

00:10:37.203 --> 00:10:38.938
going to be.

00:10:39.005 --> 00:10:41.374
Abuse it will come home I'm

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.842
probably beat them.

00:10:42.908 --> 00:10:45.044
From playing in the device.

00:10:45.111 --> 00:10:46.879
We still don't grasp I don't

00:10:46.946 --> 00:10:49.148
think as a society if we have

00:10:49.215 --> 00:10:49.548
been through it.

00:10:49.615 --> 00:10:51.183
On how deep.

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:52.918
The control is from a domestic

00:10:52.985 --> 00:10:55.321
violence abuser and so.

00:10:55.388 --> 00:10:57.089
It was very appropriate that

00:10:57.156 --> 00:10:59.291
today we're having this hearing

00:10:59.358 --> 00:10:59.959
and I want again when the think

00:11:00.026 --> 00:11:01.093
assembly member town and all of

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.429
the panelists for being here and

00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:03.829
hopefully we can.

00:11:03.896 --> 00:11:05.031
At least.

00:11:05.097 --> 00:11:05.698
Start a conversation about what

00:11:05.765 --> 00:11:06.365
is happening and what we can do

00:11:06.432 --> 00:11:09.201
and I have committed. To to the

00:11:09.268 --> 00:11:10.803
partnership --

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:11.370
Twentieth to buy men's I'm

00:11:11.437 --> 00:11:13.139
working on legislation last --

00:11:13.205 --> 00:11:15.408
The last two years I've had at

00:11:15.474 --> 00:11:19.078
least five pieces of legislation --

00:11:19.145 --> 00:11:19.645
To help victims of domestic

00:11:19.712 --> 00:11:22.948
violence.

00:11:23.015 --> 00:11:23.516
What's to provide emergency

00:11:23.582 --> 00:11:26.986
housing. To domestic violence

00:11:27.053 --> 00:11:29.221
victims that are fleeing their

00:11:29.288 --> 00:11:29.522
situations.

00:11:29.588 --> 00:11:31.090
Are under the cal works program

00:11:31.157 --> 00:11:33.526
and we were successful in the

00:11:33.592 --> 00:11:34.894
governor signed it and I

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.096
actually heard.

00:11:37.163 --> 00:11:40.900
From a counselor --

00:11:40.966 --> 00:11:43.469
And she sent me a text that said

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:44.770
that our bill is making a

00:11:44.837 --> 00:11:45.404
difference for her clients so I

00:11:45.471 --> 00:11:47.373
think the partnership for for

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.008
their support on this and all of

00:11:49.075 --> 00:11:49.542
the domestic violence --

00:11:49.608 --> 00:11:51.243
Organizations that have weighed

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:52.912
in on our legislation and then

00:11:52.978 --> 00:11:53.279
this year's --

00:11:53.345 --> 00:11:56.916
Big piece of legislation was to

00:11:56.982 --> 00:11:58.818
take guns away from --

00:11:58.884 --> 00:12:01.220
The perpetrators right now under

00:12:01.287 --> 00:12:03.055
federal law if you have a

00:12:03.122 --> 00:12:05.157
domestic violence misdemeanor

00:12:05.224 --> 00:12:06.826
federal law.

00:12:06.892 --> 00:12:07.426
You have a lifetime ban on

00:12:07.493 --> 00:12:08.828
owning a gun.

00:12:08.894 --> 00:12:10.996
In California it's only a ten

00:12:11.063 --> 00:12:11.263
year ban.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:13.032
Which out when I saw that I

00:12:13.099 --> 00:12:15.201
thought to myself my god I got.

00:12:15.267 --> 00:12:19.071
It California's leading the way

00:12:19.138 --> 00:12:22.842
and in this particular is.

00:12:22.908 --> 00:12:25.377
Will come into effect is that

00:12:25.444 --> 00:12:27.046
any domestic violence

00:12:27.113 --> 00:12:28.848
misdemeanor.

00:12:28.914 --> 00:12:30.716
Anybody they have misdemeanor

00:12:30.783 --> 00:12:32.885
domestic violence is no longer

00:12:32.952 --> 00:12:35.087
able to own a gun they're banned

00:12:35.154 --> 00:12:35.688
for life so those are the two

00:12:35.754 --> 00:12:36.822
big pieces of legislation but I

00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:37.490
know that there's little fix is

00:12:37.556 --> 00:12:39.258
that we have been able to

00:12:39.325 --> 00:12:40.759
accomplish.

00:12:40.826 --> 00:12:43.262
Big or small a step that we take

00:12:43.329 --> 00:12:46.799
towards.

00:12:46.866 --> 00:12:47.466
Hoping domestic violence victims

00:12:47.533 --> 00:12:49.301
or Iraqi Keating be the the

00:12:49.368 --> 00:12:53.038
issues of domestic violence is a

00:12:53.105 --> 00:12:55.040
step forward so I want to thank

00:12:55.107 --> 00:12:57.109

00:14:37.042 --> 00:14:37.276
concerned.

00:14:37.343 --> 00:14:39.345
About the impact of technology

00:14:39.411 --> 00:14:41.313
misused on victims of domestic

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.349
violence. To give a number to

00:14:43.415 --> 00:14:44.016
the enormity of the problem in a

00:14:44.083 --> 00:14:46.986
national survey conducted in

00:14:47.052 --> 00:14:47.620

carefully considering this

00:15:01.734 --> 00:15:02.768
complex issue in contemplating

00:15:02.835 --> 00:15:05.004
policy development to help

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:05.671
enhance protections and increase

00:15:05.738 --> 00:15:07.106
victimization.

00:15:07.172 --> 00:15:09.008

00:15:13.012 --> 00:15:13.545
story it offers a good --

00:15:13.612 --> 00:15:15.414
At the toll technology misuse

00:15:15.481 --> 00:15:16.949
has on the physical emotional

00:15:17.016 --> 00:15:19.118
and economic well being of

00:15:19.184 --> 00:15:20.819
countless survivors.

00:15:20.886 --> 00:15:23.022
A few weeks ago and they can

00:15:23.088 --> 00:15:23.689
reach out to our team and I took

00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:25.224
the call.

00:15:25.291 --> 00:15:25.858
Over the course of a few years

00:15:25.924 --> 00:15:27.226
this person gone back to school

00:15:27.293 --> 00:15:29.261
had gotten a degree while

00:15:29.328 --> 00:15:29.728
working full time.

00:15:29.795 --> 00:15:31.230
And working a full time job I

00:15:31.297 --> 00:15:34.733
apparently.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:35.334
She just been hired to a new

00:15:35.401 --> 00:15:36.869
position --

00:15:36.935 --> 00:15:39.004
At a small firm in her field and

00:15:39.071 --> 00:15:39.605
start date was set for three

00:15:39.672 --> 00:15:41.240
weeks out. Two weeks left she

00:15:41.307 --> 00:15:43.575
got a call from the owners of

00:15:43.642 --> 00:15:44.977
the company they run at a second

00:15:45.044 --> 00:15:47.379
post higher search of her name

00:15:47.446 --> 00:15:47.680
on Google.

00:15:47.746 --> 00:15:50.883
Something standard in their

00:15:50.949 --> 00:15:51.550
And I discovered numerous social

00:15:51.617 --> 00:15:53.419
media posts with her name and

00:15:53.485 --> 00:15:55.120
photograph and very rude

00:15:55.187 --> 00:15:57.022
accusations --

00:15:57.089 --> 00:15:58.757
So been made on a personal page

00:15:58.824 --> 00:16:01.060
of someone she briefly dated.

00:16:01.126 --> 00:16:01.727
She didn't know about the post

00:16:01.794 --> 00:16:02.795
until the employer call.

00:16:02.861 --> 00:16:04.963
Has a position she'd been hired

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:07.266
to fill was public facing.

00:16:07.333 --> 00:16:07.733
They told her that.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.168
That they had to put her hiring

00:16:09.234 --> 00:16:11.203
on hold it might not be able to

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:12.838
bring her on if the posted not

00:16:12.905 --> 00:16:13.138
going down.

00:16:13.205 --> 00:16:15.274
She contacted the technology

00:16:15.341 --> 00:16:16.875
companies and five opposed to be

00:16:16.942 --> 00:16:17.209
taken down.

00:16:17.276 --> 00:16:19.144
And unfortunately they were

00:16:19.211 --> 00:16:21.280
carefully crafted in a way that

00:16:21.347 --> 00:16:24.883
did not violate the terms of

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:25.517
service of the social networks.

00:16:25.584 --> 00:16:27.152
But they were good enough for

00:16:27.219 --> 00:16:28.887
the company to reconsider their

00:16:28.954 --> 00:16:29.121
offer.

00:16:29.188 --> 00:16:29.655
The technology companies

00:16:29.722 --> 00:16:32.825
responded to her report saying.

00:16:32.891 --> 00:16:35.160
We reached out to our contacts

00:16:35.227 --> 00:16:35.561
at the companies.

00:16:35.627 --> 00:16:37.029
And asked them to reconsider

00:16:37.096 --> 00:16:39.098
nope an impact on her employment.

00:16:39.164 --> 00:16:41.200
Came down but the abusive person

00:16:41.266 --> 00:16:43.335
posted Morley content on other

00:16:43.402 --> 00:16:45.104
sites. For over two weeks we

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:47.206
play this game of whack a mole

00:16:47.272 --> 00:16:49.174
the abuser would post something

00:16:49.241 --> 00:16:49.875
she would find it and report it

00:16:49.942 --> 00:16:51.110
we reach out to the company

00:16:51.176 --> 00:16:53.112
requesting that opposed to be

00:16:53.178 --> 00:16:53.379
removed.

00:16:53.445 --> 00:16:53.979
Explaining the harm they were

00:16:54.046 --> 00:16:54.780
causing.

00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:57.349
And unfortunately the abuse

00:16:57.416 --> 00:16:57.616
tactics.

00:16:57.683 --> 00:17:03.655
Used ended in the worst and the

00:17:03.722 --> 00:17:09.328
company withdrew.

00:17:09.395 --> 00:17:14.400
survivors experiences a second
use -- offer minimum we'll tell

00:17:16.668 --> 00:17:21.940
right isn't really Senate
harassment and precedent for

00:17:22.808 --> 00:17:29.548
I will say some in fact it is
story straight is not it is

00:17:29.615 --> 00:17:35.320
now and has in fact because it
is a consequences really and I

00:17:35.387 --> 00:17:40.893
was a little the Senate there's
so many reasons persons that

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:50.169
time the level of confidence
as the final Sir hello

00:17:50.235 --> 00:17:57.176
this is example -- misused
technology in a number of a

00:17:59.511 --> 00:18:05.517
easily share and and it is for
years courses they have played

00:18:07.386 --> 00:18:10.389
this is also a special song

00:18:11.156 --> 00:18:17.529
live stream for the status
modernist offices rely on

00:18:17.596 --> 00:18:26.305
anything allergy where my
reaction automation tools

00:18:26.705 --> 00:18:29.608
that is turning on lights
and radios and televisions

00:18:29.675 --> 00:18:33.812
on -- mostly surprised
because they feel that they

00:18:33.879 --> 00:18:38.550
are in for their lives hello
seventy five dollars people

00:18:38.617 --> 00:18:43.288
just because doesn't seem
possible in some cases they

00:18:43.489 --> 00:18:46.024
literacy asking because yeah

00:18:49.394 --> 00:18:55.000
maybe yeah on the other side
of the spectrum we hear from

00:18:55.067 --> 00:19:00.806
others to do it Houston on the
state's latest technologies

00:19:00.873 --> 00:19:07.012
and a half from the US being
online or saying this again

00:19:07.079 --> 00:19:14.019
is this like right now -- it
is usually -- hello this is

00:19:14.086 --> 00:19:20.459
possibility should be here and
-- the solution center this

00:19:20.526 --> 00:19:24.897
is a thousand writers have
already he said -- this is

00:19:24.963 --> 00:19:30.669
a life free from harassment
pieces -- uses office

00:19:30.736 --> 00:19:35.307
systematically stripped away
actually financial resources

00:19:35.374 --> 00:19:40.879
and saying on smartphones email
social media access to the last

00:19:42.514 --> 00:19:44.883
for heating service lifeline

00:19:48.053 --> 00:19:55.294
technology is our last
the person who uses

00:19:57.396 --> 00:20:03.068
yeah platform not solution
access to technology

00:20:03.635 --> 00:20:08.073
will not be there
technology disabilities

00:20:09.508 --> 00:20:12.244
these we used to have

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:18.183
just consider the

00:20:25.023 --> 00:20:30.762
so should we consider --
technologies to someone else's

00:20:33.365 --> 00:20:37.436
thirty five hours a week by
disconnecting the survivor

00:20:37.502 --> 00:19:56.128
and cutting off access
technology companies do have

00:19:56.128 --> 00:20:17.883
Her appointment I for it's just

00:21:07.799 --> 00:21:11.637
Run and they're less likely.

00:21:11.703 --> 00:21:17.876
We often hear used.

00:21:17.943 --> 00:21:21.747
It's time that we also that.

00:21:21.813 --> 00:21:24.316
We recognize that this is a very

00:21:24.383 --> 00:21:29.655
complex issue.

00:21:29.721 --> 00:21:33.625
Maybe there's one nation reason

00:21:33.692 --> 00:21:37.863
I don't see anything about.

00:21:37.929 --> 00:21:49.675

Berman Rubio tenants have been

Q. burger my testimony today.

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:21.266
My name is Christine met with

00:23:21.333 --> 00:23:24.870
the California partnerships and

00:23:24.936 --> 00:23:26.938
enough to balance.

00:23:27.005 --> 00:23:27.606
The partnership is the state by

00:23:27.672 --> 00:23:29.007
domestic violence coalition

00:23:29.074 --> 00:23:29.608
representing over two hundred

00:23:29.674 --> 00:23:31.143
organizations several which

00:23:31.209 --> 00:23:32.711
you'll hear from today.

00:23:32.778 --> 00:23:35.280
Organizations their plastic

00:23:35.347 --> 00:23:37.048
found survivors their families

00:23:37.115 --> 00:23:37.616
and communities all across

00:23:37.682 --> 00:23:40.585
California and there are public

00:23:40.652 --> 00:23:42.921
policy communications.

00:23:42.988 --> 00:23:43.455
Building efforts we line

00:23:43.522 --> 00:23:44.022
prevention and intervention

00:23:44.089 --> 00:23:44.856
strategies.

00:23:44.923 --> 00:23:46.758
And social change.

00:23:46.825 --> 00:23:47.259
We believe the by Shane

00:23:47.325 --> 00:23:48.660
expertise.

00:23:48.727 --> 00:23:53.131
Advocates and policymakers can

00:23:53.198 --> 00:23:55.100
and the massive violence.

00:23:55.167 --> 00:23:56.935
The partnership is also a member

00:23:57.002 --> 00:23:57.569
of the national network to end

00:23:57.636 --> 00:23:58.870
domestic violence.

00:23:58.937 --> 00:23:59.504
We work closely with them on a

00:23:59.571 --> 00:24:00.038
range of issues including

00:24:00.105 --> 00:24:00.806
confidentiality.

00:24:00.872 --> 00:24:02.641
Privacy and the intersection of

00:24:02.707 --> 00:24:04.676
domestic violence and technology.

00:24:04.743 --> 00:24:05.143
When a direct service

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:06.845
organization reaches out to me

00:24:06.912 --> 00:24:08.914
for assistance on this

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:09.247
intersection?

00:24:09.314 --> 00:24:11.082
This eighteen eighteen is the

00:24:11.149 --> 00:24:12.751
first resource I time.

00:24:12.818 --> 00:24:13.418
To an earlier this year Corbin

00:24:13.485 --> 00:24:18.690
presented a very and for me.

00:24:18.757 --> 00:24:19.257
According to the California

00:24:19.324 --> 00:24:20.959
women's health survey

00:24:21.026 --> 00:24:22.561
approximately 40% of California

00:24:22.627 --> 00:24:24.863
women experience physical

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:25.463
intimate partner once in their

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:28.834
lifetime.

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:31.102
An estimated five point. Seven

00:24:31.169 --> 00:24:31.603
five point seven million

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:32.904
California women and men

00:24:32.971 --> 00:24:34.973
experience intimate partner

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.608
violence each year.

00:24:36.675 --> 00:24:39.377
In many cases a portion of this

00:24:39.444 --> 00:24:40.812
abuse instability debt by

00:24:40.879 --> 00:24:42.848
technology.

00:24:42.914 --> 00:24:44.883
The example here throughout

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:46.985
today's hearing provided look at

00:24:47.052 --> 00:24:48.820
this pervasive in a section.

00:24:48.887 --> 00:24:50.789
Well technologies will in

00:24:50.856 --> 00:24:52.724
facilitating appears it's

00:24:52.791 --> 00:24:53.291
important to understand and

00:24:53.358 --> 00:24:53.558
address.

00:24:53.625 --> 00:24:54.993
We must also remember that at

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:56.628
the core are the issues of power

00:24:56.695 --> 00:24:57.329
and control that are at the root

00:24:57.395 --> 00:25:00.765
of all domestic violence.

00:25:00.832 --> 00:25:01.366
Whether technology is used or

00:25:01.433 --> 00:25:04.669
not.

00:25:04.736 --> 00:25:07.205
A server from northern

00:25:07.272 --> 00:25:09.007
California asked me to share her

00:25:09.074 --> 00:25:11.109
story with the own. Six months

00:25:11.176 --> 00:25:14.846
to a year.

00:25:14.913 --> 00:25:15.413
Operating from a physically

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.082
abusive partner.

00:25:17.148 --> 00:25:17.682
She was hanging out with her

00:25:17.749 --> 00:25:19.084
friends and a male friend walked

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:22.721
in his face a mixture of panic

00:25:22.787 --> 00:25:24.890
and pity.

00:25:24.956 --> 00:25:28.793
And said have you seen Facebook.

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:30.829
Her her think any side he's

00:25:30.896 --> 00:25:32.597
added again.

00:25:32.664 --> 00:25:35.200
She frantically turn on her

00:25:35.267 --> 00:25:36.601
laptop.

00:25:36.668 --> 00:25:36.801
Open.

00:25:36.868 --> 00:25:39.004
And saw the naked at the top

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:40.906
half of her body.

00:25:40.972 --> 00:25:44.609
Based on all.

00:25:44.676 --> 00:25:46.978
Day about her.

00:25:47.045 --> 00:25:47.612
The wrong twenty words written

00:25:47.679 --> 00:25:50.916
all of them.

00:25:50.982 --> 00:25:51.383
The naked photos were

00:25:51.449 --> 00:25:52.617
unflattering.

00:25:52.684 --> 00:25:55.387
Nothing even flattering photos

00:25:55.453 --> 00:25:56.988
would have been okay but it felt

00:25:57.055 --> 00:25:58.823
like salt in the wound to see

00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:00.725
the photos that were never okay

00:26:00.792 --> 00:26:02.928
to be used in this manner.

00:26:02.994 --> 00:26:04.629
She did not agree to the photos

00:26:04.696 --> 00:26:06.898
they were taken without her

00:26:06.965 --> 00:26:07.165
consent.

00:26:07.232 --> 00:26:08.967
After shout when she's reaching

00:26:09.034 --> 00:26:11.036
for a towel --

00:26:11.102 --> 00:26:12.804
Perpetrator with Y. as he took

00:26:12.871 --> 00:26:14.873
the photo.

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:15.440
And laughed again when she

00:26:15.507 --> 00:26:26.818
protested the removed the post.

00:26:26.885 --> 00:26:27.485
Embarrassed he didn't even begin

00:26:27.552 --> 00:26:31.056
to describe it.

00:26:31.122 --> 00:26:33.058
The posts were made from social

00:26:33.124 --> 00:26:34.793
media accounts created in her

00:26:34.859 --> 00:26:37.162
name the hydrant at her friends.

00:26:37.228 --> 00:26:39.164
And other posts were made and

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:42.734
her perpetrators seem and

00:26:42.801 --> 00:26:43.335
somewhere made with you don't

00:26:43.401 --> 00:26:46.604
names.

00:26:46.671 --> 00:26:48.873
When she started a new job a

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:49.474
single mom of a toddler at the

00:26:49.541 --> 00:26:50.775
time?

00:26:50.842 --> 00:26:53.211
Learning and living life in the

00:26:53.278 --> 00:26:57.048
aftermath of physical abuse.

00:26:57.115 --> 00:26:59.217
Email began being sent to her

00:26:59.284 --> 00:27:00.885
new boss.

00:27:00.952 --> 00:27:02.654
Security and other employees the

00:27:02.721 --> 00:27:05.156
company with pictures comments

00:27:05.223 --> 00:27:08.626
and warnings.

00:27:08.693 --> 00:27:12.864
Not to trust the for she didn't

00:27:12.931 --> 00:27:14.599
find out about this until after

00:27:14.666 --> 00:27:15.166
almost a year after working

00:27:15.233 --> 00:27:17.135
there.

00:27:17.202 --> 00:27:17.769
When the security guard hardly

00:27:17.836 --> 00:27:22.640
mentioned that?

00:27:22.707 --> 00:27:28.680
Wishing means never and in

00:27:28.747 --> 00:27:34.919
between us her perfect figure.

00:27:34.986 --> 00:27:35.520
The teacher looked at all the

00:27:35.587 --> 00:27:36.654
photos.

00:27:36.721 --> 00:27:39.024
Posted.

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:40.959
And tax and informed her that

00:27:41.026 --> 00:27:42.594
because she was married.

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:44.996
The photos with the property of

00:27:45.063 --> 00:27:45.630
her perpetrator and for future

00:27:45.697 --> 00:27:47.032
reference it would really be

00:27:47.098 --> 00:27:48.933
better not to take photos

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.004
without her clothes on she was

00:27:53.071 --> 00:27:53.671
far too ashamed to even begin to

00:27:53.738 --> 00:27:57.275
explain but she did not confess

00:27:57.342 --> 00:27:58.710
the photos.

00:27:58.777 --> 00:27:59.411
She didn't have the self esteem

00:27:59.477 --> 00:28:02.881
at the time to get not officer

00:28:02.947 --> 00:28:04.983
for blaming her.

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:05.617
And looking at the photos to

00:28:05.683 --> 00:28:06.918
determine that there was no

00:28:06.985 --> 00:28:08.586
crime when he could have

00:28:08.653 --> 00:28:09.120
determined not without an

00:28:09.187 --> 00:28:11.256
additional person looking at

00:28:11.322 --> 00:28:14.926
these photos.

00:28:14.993 --> 00:28:18.663
Eventually the postdocs. To

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:19.297
learn about way she could feel

00:28:19.364 --> 00:28:20.932
safe online.

00:28:20.999 --> 00:28:21.466
She had information about

00:28:21.533 --> 00:28:23.201
herself and never posted

00:28:23.268 --> 00:28:26.604
publicly in. Eight years later

00:28:26.671 --> 00:28:27.172
she has only started to make

00:28:27.238 --> 00:28:28.640
some post public.

00:28:28.706 --> 00:28:30.975
Several years after her

00:28:31.042 --> 00:28:33.144
experience she thought that laws

00:28:33.211 --> 00:28:33.812
were passed making this activity

00:28:33.878 --> 00:28:36.681
criminal.

00:28:36.748 --> 00:28:38.983
It was too late to her but she

00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:42.821
hopes the others I hope by the

00:28:42.887 --> 00:28:43.421
five thank you for hearing my

00:28:43.488 --> 00:28:47.025
testimony say in a line need to

00:28:47.092 --> 00:28:48.960
show the survivor story with the

00:28:49.027 --> 00:28:49.594
the partnership is a resource

00:28:49.661 --> 00:28:50.862
for domestic violence programs.

00:28:50.929 --> 00:28:51.362
And also the California

00:28:51.429 --> 00:28:55.100
legislature as we work together

00:28:55.166 --> 00:28:57.168
to and enough to balance.

00:28:57.235 --> 00:29:06.711
Thank you very much.

00:29:06.778 --> 00:29:10.715
The the problem she stopped

00:29:10.782 --> 00:29:12.884
posting.

00:29:12.951 --> 00:29:16.721
Because and she found weights.

00:29:16.788 --> 00:29:18.923
Keep proposed secrets again.

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:23.294
But being is that the victims

00:29:23.361 --> 00:29:24.929
are are forced to be the ones to

00:29:24.996 --> 00:29:27.265
ask so that they are not

00:29:27.332 --> 00:29:28.766
victimized again.

00:29:28.833 --> 00:29:29.434
Thank you for that I appreciate

00:29:29.501 --> 00:29:30.802
it -- And

00:29:30.869 --> 00:29:32.637
then also next --

00:29:32.704 --> 00:29:34.739
We have a new be guided those

00:29:34.806 --> 00:29:37.075
legal advocate for human options.

00:29:37.142 --> 00:29:40.645
Walk thank you hi good morning

00:29:40.712 --> 00:29:42.981
everybody I'm yeah the valuables

00:29:43.047 --> 00:29:44.949
and leave it with him and

00:29:45.016 --> 00:29:50.588
options Constantine.

00:29:50.655 --> 00:29:53.091
Also support tell support

00:29:53.158 --> 00:29:54.626
immigration --

00:29:54.692 --> 00:29:56.761
But today I'm here to talk about

00:29:56.828 --> 00:29:59.030
the economy and how I see with

00:29:59.097 --> 00:29:59.531
my clients when they are

00:29:59.597 --> 00:29:59.831
disclosing.

00:29:59.898 --> 00:30:03.134
That there is some type of

00:30:03.201 --> 00:30:03.568
technology if you.

00:30:03.635 --> 00:30:05.236
So a few months ago I actually

00:30:05.303 --> 00:30:08.673
had a nine and her name is going

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:09.240
to be Mario we're going to

00:30:09.307 --> 00:30:10.975
change the name.

00:30:11.042 --> 00:30:12.877
And Maria came to me because she

00:30:12.944 --> 00:30:13.478
actually wanted to know about

00:30:13.545 --> 00:30:15.213
divorce she had been married to

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:16.948
her husband for about fifteen to

00:30:17.015 --> 00:30:18.816
twenty years.

00:30:18.883 --> 00:30:19.484
And she finally decided that she

00:30:19.551 --> 00:30:21.286
wanted it and the relationship

00:30:21.352 --> 00:30:21.920
legally she had been separated

00:30:21.986 --> 00:30:23.121
for a few months and they had

00:30:23.188 --> 00:30:24.923
been living in separate homes

00:30:24.989 --> 00:30:27.091
but she wanted to officially do

00:30:27.158 --> 00:30:28.826
it legally.

00:30:28.893 --> 00:30:30.962
So I've been legal advocate in

00:30:31.029 --> 00:30:32.897
our intake we actually asked

00:30:32.964 --> 00:30:34.899
several questions.

00:30:34.966 --> 00:30:36.768
And always ask privacy questions

00:30:36.834 --> 00:30:39.070
some clients actually don't know

00:30:39.137 --> 00:30:40.672
they're being stock.

00:30:40.738 --> 00:30:43.074
And and it's I think it's fair

00:30:43.141 --> 00:30:44.642
to say I sometimes don't even

00:30:44.709 --> 00:30:46.878
know how to use my iPhone and I

00:30:46.945 --> 00:30:49.113
can look with technology so for

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:50.715
someone that's older that

00:30:50.782 --> 00:30:52.884
probably can operate within all

00:30:52.951 --> 00:30:53.451
the G. or maybe we are just

00:30:53.518 --> 00:30:54.586
aren't tech savvy.

00:30:54.652 --> 00:30:56.854
We don't think that someone is

00:30:56.921 --> 00:30:57.488
capable of stopping us through

00:30:57.555 --> 00:30:58.623
our phone --

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:01.059
So while I was doing the privacy

00:31:01.125 --> 00:31:04.596
assessment.

00:31:04.662 --> 00:31:06.965
She started saying that no he's

00:31:07.031 --> 00:31:08.833
not stalking me --

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:09.434
But when she started talking

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:10.034
about the abuse she actually

00:31:10.101 --> 00:31:11.002
started to talk about how.

00:31:11.069 --> 00:31:14.939
He sometimes pop in locations

00:31:15.006 --> 00:31:18.776
where she was.

00:31:18.843 --> 00:31:21.145
And not rose a red flag told

00:31:21.212 --> 00:31:21.646
what does that mean --

00:31:21.713 --> 00:31:23.114
So she started saying that when

00:31:23.181 --> 00:31:25.116
she was having dinner with a

00:31:25.183 --> 00:31:25.350
friend.

00:31:25.416 --> 00:31:26.918
Every now and then she was

00:31:26.985 --> 00:31:28.853
seated pick truck parked in the

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:29.187
parking lot.

00:31:29.254 --> 00:31:31.089
And he wouldn't get out from his

00:31:31.155 --> 00:31:32.757
truck he would just stay there

00:31:32.824 --> 00:31:35.026
and the first time he thought

00:31:35.093 --> 00:31:35.627
well maybe this is coincidence

00:31:35.693 --> 00:31:38.896
may.

00:31:38.963 --> 00:31:40.965
Following her from our house to

00:31:41.032 --> 00:31:43.067
the restaurant and he never did.

00:31:43.134 --> 00:31:43.601
So when she met with me I

00:31:43.668 --> 00:31:46.738
actually educated her about

00:31:46.804 --> 00:31:47.305
hacking softwares I can be

00:31:47.372 --> 00:31:48.706
installed on your phones and

00:31:48.773 --> 00:31:51.042
they can be used to track you to

00:31:51.109 --> 00:31:51.609
monitor your whereabouts.

00:31:51.676 --> 00:31:53.411
During the American during her

00:31:53.478 --> 00:31:54.045
relationship when they used to

00:31:54.112 --> 00:31:54.946
live together he actually

00:31:55.013 --> 00:31:57.148
monitored everything she did and

00:31:57.215 --> 00:31:58.716
she had to report to him.

00:31:58.783 --> 00:32:01.052
Where she was at what time she

00:32:01.119 --> 00:32:01.586
was going to come back?

00:32:01.653 --> 00:32:04.856
And when she got home she had to

00:32:04.922 --> 00:32:06.791
call him from a land line so she

00:32:06.858 --> 00:32:07.425
needs so he knew that she was

00:32:07.492 --> 00:32:10.928
home -- So

00:32:10.995 --> 00:32:11.529
we started talking we started

00:32:11.596 --> 00:32:14.999
safety I mean and IT review

00:32:15.066 --> 00:32:18.736
resources.

00:32:18.803 --> 00:32:19.370
Actually gave review resources

00:32:19.437 --> 00:32:20.872
from the national network to end

00:32:20.938 --> 00:32:21.306
domestic violence.

00:32:21.372 --> 00:32:26.644
And she became more.

00:32:26.711 --> 00:32:29.013
He thought maybe I am in stock

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:30.915
do my phone and I started asking

00:32:30.982 --> 00:32:32.950
her she have a GPS location on

00:32:33.017 --> 00:32:34.952
at all times she said yes they

00:32:35.019 --> 00:32:35.586
don't know how to turn it off I

00:32:35.653 --> 00:32:37.188
thought your phone comes like

00:32:37.255 --> 00:32:37.388
that.

00:32:37.455 --> 00:32:38.056
So I educated her on how to turn

00:32:38.122 --> 00:32:39.324
off your GPS location how to

00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:40.992
adjust your settings but a

00:32:41.059 --> 00:32:43.328
really encouraged her to speak

00:32:43.394 --> 00:32:46.764
out how by the tech agencies.

00:32:46.831 --> 00:32:48.766
On which I'm glad he did when he

00:32:48.833 --> 00:32:50.735
did more research she actually

00:32:50.802 --> 00:32:51.336
started researching on you.

00:32:51.402 --> 00:32:53.171
To double the cost and video on

00:32:53.237 --> 00:32:54.939
YouTube that actually teaches

00:32:55.006 --> 00:32:57.008
hackers hot hot.

00:32:57.075 --> 00:32:58.910
But it also teaches you how to

00:32:58.976 --> 00:33:00.912
know if your phone attack.

00:33:00.978 --> 00:33:03.014
On a she was able to do the

00:33:03.081 --> 00:33:05.016
status and if perform with happy

00:33:05.083 --> 00:33:05.650
at the end of message will pump

00:33:05.717 --> 00:33:07.251
on your phone same.

00:33:07.318 --> 00:33:14.759
If your phone was hacked what

00:33:14.826 --> 00:33:17.061
with the hacker able to see.

00:33:17.128 --> 00:33:18.730
Well the message came up and

00:33:18.796 --> 00:33:19.397
shoot at that moment me that her

00:33:19.464 --> 00:33:21.232
husband was able to read her

00:33:21.299 --> 00:33:21.566
text messages.

00:33:21.632 --> 00:33:24.836
Was able --

00:33:24.902 --> 00:33:28.940
I immediately told your go to

00:33:29.006 --> 00:33:31.075
agency where they do tax so they

00:33:31.142 --> 00:33:31.743
can see what's offer it is to be

00:33:31.809 --> 00:33:33.177
can remove it and how you can --

00:33:33.244 --> 00:33:34.946
If you want to press charges

00:33:35.012 --> 00:33:36.647
what type of evidence do you eat.

00:33:36.714 --> 00:33:38.916
So she ended going back to

00:33:38.983 --> 00:33:39.550
eighteen T. where he purchased

00:33:39.617 --> 00:33:41.018
her phone and they were too they

00:33:41.085 --> 00:33:42.787
were able to a sister.

00:33:42.854 --> 00:33:44.889
They ended up helping her figure

00:33:44.956 --> 00:33:45.556
out what type of South Korea was

00:33:45.623 --> 00:33:48.826
they took it out of her phone --

00:33:48.893 --> 00:33:49.460
Make up the evidence and I am

00:33:49.527 --> 00:33:50.995
unsure if she ever did press

00:33:51.062 --> 00:33:52.764
charges.

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:53.431
But he came back to me one last

00:33:53.498 --> 00:33:54.799
session to close her file and

00:33:54.866 --> 00:33:55.333
when she did she was very

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:56.667
grateful.

00:33:56.734 --> 00:33:59.003
That instead of us telling her

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:00.838
stop using your device.

00:34:00.905 --> 00:34:03.040
ID with the tools and education.

00:34:03.107 --> 00:34:06.844
For her to actually reach out

00:34:06.911 --> 00:34:07.478
for it to individuals that knew

00:34:07.545 --> 00:34:10.815
how to work the technology world --

00:34:10.882 --> 00:34:13.251
And guide her so that way she

00:34:13.317 --> 00:34:14.952
can use the device and continue

00:34:15.019 --> 00:34:16.954
with your daily routine.

00:34:17.021 --> 00:34:18.656
But now she does it in a safe

00:34:18.723 --> 00:34:20.758
manner and now she knows where

00:34:20.825 --> 00:34:27.231
she can go if she ever needed

00:34:27.298 --> 00:34:28.699
for the house.

00:34:28.766 --> 00:34:29.267
Thank you so much for having

00:34:29.333 --> 00:34:34.605
today.

00:34:34.672 --> 00:34:37.108
Thank you I hope world taking

00:34:37.175 --> 00:34:37.642
notes because I think --

00:34:37.708 --> 00:34:40.678
You know the information that

00:34:40.745 --> 00:34:43.247
we're receiving is again mind.

00:34:43.314 --> 00:34:46.884
Boggling to me to know that

00:34:46.951 --> 00:34:47.485
people go to those lengths --

00:34:47.552 --> 00:34:50.888
I would not have the you know

00:34:50.955 --> 00:34:52.723
where to begin thank you for the

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:54.859
you.

00:34:54.926 --> 00:34:56.994
To reference by.

00:34:57.061 --> 00:34:58.729
You know kids today are.

00:34:58.796 --> 00:35:01.032
Are you too bye all the time --

00:35:01.098 --> 00:35:02.834
But it doesn't occur to me that

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:06.637
all of this can you know B. and

00:35:06.704 --> 00:35:06.971
be -- Picked

00:35:07.038 --> 00:35:14.879
up. To Christine in your in your

00:35:14.946 --> 00:35:16.647
scenario the did the victim

00:35:16.714 --> 00:35:17.281
actually report the incident to

00:35:17.348 --> 00:35:18.983
the authorities.

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:24.689
On or the court for that matter.

00:35:24.755 --> 00:35:27.058
Follow it with a quick about it

00:35:27.125 --> 00:35:30.962
to her but he told her that it

00:35:31.028 --> 00:35:31.329
wasn't friends.

00:35:31.395 --> 00:35:32.997
Because he was because the

00:35:33.064 --> 00:35:34.632
perpetrator with her husband and

00:35:34.699 --> 00:35:37.335
her husband taking the photos of

00:35:37.401 --> 00:35:40.705
her.

00:35:40.771 --> 00:35:42.874
I see I I know that we have a

00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:43.374
penal code that actually

00:35:43.441 --> 00:35:44.775
addresses that that that

00:35:44.842 --> 00:35:47.078
particular situation is called

00:35:47.144 --> 00:35:50.748
because Cannella movie --

00:35:50.815 --> 00:35:53.184
Law in a co six forty seven but

00:35:53.251 --> 00:35:53.885
but I'll be happy to look into a

00:35:53.951 --> 00:35:54.852
little bit more --

00:35:54.919 --> 00:35:57.154
Because of that relationship to

00:35:57.221 --> 00:36:00.725
spousal relationship. To see we

00:36:00.791 --> 00:36:01.325
need to fine tune the law as

00:36:01.392 --> 00:36:04.862
well on is worth hacking

00:36:04.929 --> 00:36:06.864
situation is concerned there's

00:36:06.931 --> 00:36:08.633
in fact I did it I did a bill

00:36:08.699 --> 00:36:10.801
all on packing --

00:36:10.868 --> 00:36:14.839
Anti hacking also of AB.

00:36:14.906 --> 00:36:16.974
One five I wonder if dot also

00:36:17.041 --> 00:36:17.608
would address that particular

00:36:17.675 --> 00:36:20.745
situation but all out also

00:36:20.811 --> 00:36:28.786
investigate --

00:36:28.853 --> 00:36:33.057
As to cordon situation --

00:36:33.124 --> 00:36:33.624
And they were receptive and

00:36:33.691 --> 00:36:35.192
generally what we'll do we get

00:36:35.259 --> 00:36:37.562
requests from survivors who have

00:36:37.628 --> 00:36:39.330
been flat things and they're not

00:36:39.397 --> 00:36:41.098
taking taken down by the company.

00:36:41.165 --> 00:36:41.766
That will will look through the

00:36:41.832 --> 00:36:42.867
terms of service ourself fine

00:36:42.934 --> 00:36:45.102
but if we can.

00:36:45.169 --> 00:36:46.604
Point to eat.

00:36:46.671 --> 00:36:48.940
Reach out for the company point

00:36:49.006 --> 00:36:49.507
to some of the harness being

00:36:49.574 --> 00:36:50.975
because and and escalate done --

00:36:51.042 --> 00:36:53.411
And sometimes having a voice in

00:36:53.477 --> 00:36:53.978
the next helps because we do

00:36:54.045 --> 00:36:55.246
work with them on a regular

00:36:55.313 --> 00:36:56.948
basis around the development of

00:36:57.014 --> 00:36:57.248
technology.

00:36:57.315 --> 00:36:59.016
So as they're releasing --

00:36:59.083 --> 00:36:59.617
New products or software or

00:36:59.684 --> 00:37:00.651
policies --

00:37:00.718 --> 00:37:03.254
A lot of times the work that we

00:37:03.321 --> 00:37:04.622
do with them is.

00:37:04.689 --> 00:37:06.724
To take those or release analyze

00:37:06.791 --> 00:37:08.793
them provide feedback on how

00:37:08.859 --> 00:37:09.393
someone might issues that are

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:11.128
might be harmed by it --

00:37:11.195 --> 00:37:13.030
So they they've been very

00:37:13.097 --> 00:37:15.299
receptive the hope the hope is

00:37:15.366 --> 00:37:16.867
that technology of as the design.

00:37:16.934 --> 00:37:18.769
Of it within the design process

00:37:18.836 --> 00:37:20.905
they'll be a proactive

00:37:20.972 --> 00:37:22.640
prevention based --

00:37:22.707 --> 00:37:24.809
Model --

00:37:24.875 --> 00:37:33.084
Adopted for the future that

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:36.687
doesn't work.

00:37:36.754 --> 00:37:39.256
You know we'll do legislation

00:37:39.323 --> 00:37:40.992
others to do the needed but if

00:37:41.058 --> 00:37:43.160
they're these companies are

00:37:43.227 --> 00:37:44.929
willing you know on their own to

00:37:44.996 --> 00:37:46.897
do. To get you know --

00:37:46.964 --> 00:37:49.200
Accepted your input I think that

00:37:49.266 --> 00:37:55.239
may be a good sign right good

00:37:55.306 --> 00:37:56.774

Thank you very much [inaudible]

00:38:47.024 --> 00:38:57.034
And welcome [inaudible]

excuse me for having here today

00:39:11.348 --> 00:39:12.783
actually didn't prepare a

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:13.451
written statement simply because

00:39:13.517 --> 00:39:16.921
I like to react to what I hear

00:39:16.987 --> 00:39:17.254
everybody's --

00:39:17.321 --> 00:39:18.689
Saying in the room --

00:39:18.756 --> 00:39:20.825
Initially let me --

00:39:20.891 --> 00:39:21.158
Say that --

00:39:21.225 --> 00:39:22.860
In terms of what Christine was

00:39:22.927 --> 00:39:25.129
speaking about in regards that

00:39:25.196 --> 00:39:25.796
revenge porn cases and it to me

00:39:25.863 --> 00:39:26.664
like that occurred.

00:39:26.731 --> 00:39:29.066
Probably before twenty thirteen

00:39:29.133 --> 00:39:29.700
or twenty fourteen when that law

00:39:29.767 --> 00:39:31.068
was passed --

00:39:31.135 --> 00:39:32.937
As a please someone give you

00:39:33.003 --> 00:39:33.471
background on myself real

00:39:33.537 --> 00:39:35.039
quickly --

00:39:35.106 --> 00:39:36.907
On the master investigator which

00:39:36.974 --> 00:39:37.508
just means I get paid a little

00:39:37.575 --> 00:39:38.609
bit more --

00:39:38.676 --> 00:39:41.078
Been around longer time.

00:39:41.145 --> 00:39:43.013
I've been a detective --

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:45.082
For probably about fifteen years

00:39:45.149 --> 00:39:45.683
a police officer for nineteen

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:46.584
years.

00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:48.953
Prior to that I was a reporter

00:39:49.019 --> 00:39:50.788
and a newspaper journalist.

00:39:50.855 --> 00:39:51.288
So I have somewhat of an

00:39:51.355 --> 00:39:54.592
interesting take.

00:39:54.658 --> 00:39:56.994
On training etcetera I believe

00:39:57.061 --> 00:39:57.495
training is actually are

00:39:57.561 --> 00:39:58.129
solution to a lot of what we're

00:39:58.195 --> 00:40:04.869
talking about here today.

00:40:04.935 --> 00:40:07.204
And I some things ninety quickly

00:40:07.271 --> 00:40:08.839
that not only does domestic

00:40:08.906 --> 00:40:10.975
violence affect the victims that

00:40:11.041 --> 00:40:12.610
we are here talking about today.

00:40:12.676 --> 00:40:15.012
But didn't mystic violence

00:40:15.079 --> 00:40:16.781
suspects are often times the

00:40:16.847 --> 00:40:17.414
people who are committing mass

00:40:17.481 --> 00:40:18.749
homicide.

00:40:18.816 --> 00:40:20.718
Targeted by once it's set or in

00:40:20.785 --> 00:40:21.085
our community.

00:40:21.152 --> 00:40:22.787
Strangulation cases and more so

00:40:22.853 --> 00:40:24.889
we've combined knows because one

00:40:24.955 --> 00:40:25.489
of the things that we see it

00:40:25.556 --> 00:40:26.657
riverside county sheriff's.

00:40:26.724 --> 00:40:28.993
Is that we have a lot of silo

00:40:29.059 --> 00:40:29.527
effect going on we have

00:40:29.593 --> 00:40:30.995
different agencies working on

00:40:31.061 --> 00:40:33.197
different projects and different

00:40:33.264 --> 00:40:34.832
programs and not everybody's

00:40:34.899 --> 00:40:35.432
working together and talking

00:40:35.499 --> 00:40:36.867
together --

00:40:36.934 --> 00:40:39.036
We do have a lot of laws on the

00:40:39.103 --> 00:40:39.703
books and I wrote down a few of

00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:40.805
them -- Just

00:40:40.871 --> 00:40:42.940
in case I forgot all the sub

00:40:43.007 --> 00:40:43.240
sections --

00:40:43.307 --> 00:40:47.344
But I would like to start with

00:40:47.411 --> 00:40:48.679
simply saying that.

00:40:48.746 --> 00:40:50.881
You know police officers want to

00:40:50.948 --> 00:40:51.315
do the right thing.

00:40:51.382 --> 00:40:53.017
The majority of us obviously we

00:40:53.083 --> 00:40:53.617
can get into this because we

00:40:53.684 --> 00:40:54.718
love the money --

00:40:54.785 --> 00:40:55.352
We got into this because we want

00:40:55.419 --> 00:40:56.854
to help people.

00:40:56.921 --> 00:40:59.023
But we are we need to be Jack of

00:40:59.089 --> 00:41:00.691
all trades.

00:41:00.758 --> 00:41:02.760
And we have vehicle codes penal

00:41:02.827 --> 00:41:04.995
codes health in institutions

00:41:05.062 --> 00:41:05.563
goes well for an institution

00:41:05.629 --> 00:41:08.766
code and so on and so on and

00:41:08.833 --> 00:41:09.366
then we are master of what we

00:41:09.433 --> 00:41:10.835
choose.

00:41:10.901 --> 00:41:12.837
So a lot of people choose to get

00:41:12.903 --> 00:41:15.206
be masters and drugs and gangs

00:41:15.272 --> 00:41:17.341
and homicide in all that sexy

00:41:17.408 --> 00:41:18.976
stuff.

00:41:19.043 --> 00:41:20.878
And some of us choose to become

00:41:20.945 --> 00:41:21.478
masters and domestic violence

00:41:21.545 --> 00:41:22.947
and threats.

00:41:23.013 --> 00:41:24.849
So when I go back to that kind

00:41:24.915 --> 00:41:28.853
what we're talking about we have

00:41:28.919 --> 00:41:29.486
to seventy three point six which

00:41:29.553 --> 00:41:31.055
is a restraining order law --

00:41:31.121 --> 00:41:33.090
We fail so often is law

00:41:33.157 --> 00:41:35.259
enforcement go to recognize that

00:41:35.326 --> 00:41:36.994
we're actually looking at six

00:41:37.061 --> 00:41:40.831
forty six point nine subsection

00:41:40.898 --> 00:41:42.766
a and B. are stalking laws. Two

00:41:42.833 --> 00:41:44.802
instances of addressing

00:41:44.869 --> 00:41:45.469
repeatedly following tracking it

00:41:45.536 --> 00:41:48.806
cetera and a credible threat.

00:41:48.873 --> 00:41:49.406
Because we have lost along the

00:41:49.473 --> 00:41:51.141
way the concept of training our

00:41:51.208 --> 00:41:53.110
officers what credible threat

00:41:53.177 --> 00:41:54.678
really means.

00:41:54.745 --> 00:41:56.847
In the olden days if you will

00:41:56.914 --> 00:41:57.481
for twenty two PC which is our

00:41:57.548 --> 00:41:59.083
criminal threats.

00:41:59.149 --> 00:42:00.684
Credible threat.

00:42:00.751 --> 00:42:01.352
Was identified as someone being

00:42:01.418 --> 00:42:03.087
right in front of you with the

00:42:03.153 --> 00:42:05.022
immediate ability to commit the

00:42:05.089 --> 00:42:05.623
act at that moment [inaudible]

00:42:05.689 --> 00:42:08.692
Now.

00:42:08.759 --> 00:42:10.995
We train our criminal threat.

00:42:11.061 --> 00:42:13.130
If we're talking on online are

00:42:13.197 --> 00:42:15.032
we right there at that moment.

00:42:15.099 --> 00:42:18.936
That I we're not.

00:42:19.003 --> 00:42:20.804
So a lot of people I think maybe

00:42:20.871 --> 00:42:22.940
have a misunderstanding about

00:42:23.007 --> 00:42:24.675
our online bullying and

00:42:24.742 --> 00:42:26.610
threatening its center believes

00:42:26.677 --> 00:42:27.211
because a long time ago the

00:42:27.278 --> 00:42:28.913
courts actually dress with Brett

00:42:28.979 --> 00:42:29.246
actually it.

00:42:29.313 --> 00:42:31.215
If a reasonable person would

00:42:31.282 --> 00:42:31.749
feel threatened in that

00:42:31.815 --> 00:42:32.650
circumstance.

00:42:32.716 --> 00:42:35.152
Then it's a threat so its course

00:42:35.219 --> 00:42:35.452
of conduct.

00:42:35.519 --> 00:42:37.154
So we have stock month we have a

00:42:37.221 --> 00:42:40.724
restraining order laws we have --

00:42:40.791 --> 00:42:42.626
Five oh two which is our hacking

00:42:42.693 --> 00:42:44.762
and computer data law for

00:42:44.828 --> 00:42:45.362
getting into people's emails

00:42:45.429 --> 00:42:46.664
etcetera.

00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:47.264
Everything we've been talking

00:42:47.331 --> 00:42:49.066
about today there's a law that

00:42:49.133 --> 00:42:49.700
exist me to do something about

00:42:49.767 --> 00:42:50.834
it which is great.

00:42:50.901 --> 00:42:54.672
But there are definitely places

00:42:54.738 --> 00:42:56.707
where we can improve --

00:42:56.774 --> 00:42:59.076
We could use some stronger

00:42:59.143 --> 00:43:01.011
sentences in or surfaced you

00:43:01.078 --> 00:43:03.147
skews me stronger requirements

00:43:03.213 --> 00:43:04.715
in our probation sentencing --

00:43:04.782 --> 00:43:07.151
Once we have domestic on

00:43:07.217 --> 00:43:10.854
subjects are sentenced and

00:43:10.921 --> 00:43:12.823
access to their phones and right

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:13.424
now we have limited access to

00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:16.694
their phones.

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:17.261
It's great to talk about how

00:43:17.328 --> 00:43:19.096
much of the technology companies

00:43:19.163 --> 00:43:19.763
help us but as a police officer

00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:20.998
sometimes a little difficult for

00:43:21.065 --> 00:43:22.700
me -- I love

00:43:22.766 --> 00:43:24.935
apple I have tons of apple

00:43:25.002 --> 00:43:27.104
products get me wrong and many

00:43:27.171 --> 00:43:31.375
great your apple just in case

00:43:31.442 --> 00:43:35.045
you're watching that is a can to

00:43:35.112 --> 00:43:35.346
basically.

00:43:35.412 --> 00:43:36.947
Allowing them to testify against

00:43:37.014 --> 00:43:39.283
himself I can't however get them

00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:42.753
to give me their fingerprint.

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:46.824
Do I need not open this phone.

00:43:46.890 --> 00:43:48.892
Anybody who knows your phone off

00:43:48.959 --> 00:43:49.426
when you have to put in.

00:43:49.493 --> 00:43:50.894
Your password.

00:43:50.961 --> 00:43:52.696
So I can't compelling about it

00:43:52.763 --> 00:43:53.263
give me that I can maybe not

00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:55.265
even get into the perpetrators

00:43:55.332 --> 00:43:56.767
devices to see what's going on

00:43:56.834 --> 00:43:59.069
to see what computer technology

00:43:59.136 --> 00:44:00.738
debuts -- I

00:44:00.804 --> 00:44:03.140
think when we talk about

00:44:03.207 --> 00:44:05.075
training it's not just training

00:44:05.142 --> 00:44:06.877
police officers.

00:44:06.944 --> 00:44:09.046
It's train all of us together.

00:44:09.113 --> 00:44:11.048
Like you said it's your not

00:44:11.115 --> 00:44:12.983
that's accepted.

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:14.985
Okay I'm not super tech savvy

00:44:15.052 --> 00:44:17.087
sorry apple I'm not.

00:44:17.154 --> 00:44:17.354
Having --

00:44:17.421 --> 00:44:18.722
But there are people who are so

00:44:18.789 --> 00:44:19.323
we could definitely use more

00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:20.724
technical assistance centers.

00:44:20.791 --> 00:44:22.993
That could work with law

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:23.627
enforcement and work with our

00:44:23.694 --> 00:44:25.029
victims we have those around the

00:44:25.095 --> 00:44:25.662
country right now and I believe

00:44:25.729 --> 00:44:27.297
that partnering with the family

00:44:27.364 --> 00:44:28.932
justice centers.

00:44:28.999 --> 00:44:30.701
Would be a fantastic to do that

00:44:30.768 --> 00:44:31.301
we have been we just centers

00:44:31.368 --> 00:44:32.603
throughout the United States

00:44:32.669 --> 00:44:33.203
throughout the world frankly.

00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:36.607
And be able to use that a

00:44:36.673 --> 00:44:38.909
foundational area for all of the

00:44:38.976 --> 00:44:39.543
things we're talking about here

00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:40.210
I think is great because all the

00:44:40.277 --> 00:44:41.011
advocacy programs can work with

00:44:41.078 --> 00:44:42.946
them.

00:44:43.013 --> 00:44:43.514
All law enforcement to work

00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:44.882
within the district attorney's

00:44:44.948 --> 00:44:48.786
offices etcetera etcetera --

00:44:48.852 --> 00:44:54.925
So one of the things that I I I

00:44:54.992 --> 00:44:55.492
see that we're talking a lot

00:44:55.559 --> 00:44:58.862
about different wars remote

00:44:58.929 --> 00:45:00.931
smart home devices.

00:45:00.998 --> 00:45:02.966
However we can also use those to

00:45:03.033 --> 00:45:03.434
protect our victims.

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:06.870
Using remote smart home devices

00:45:06.937 --> 00:45:08.772
is actually wonderful thing.

00:45:08.839 --> 00:45:09.339
Having access to that which

00:45:09.406 --> 00:45:10.874
we've actually obtained access

00:45:10.941 --> 00:45:13.310
to some of those voter victim of

00:45:13.377 --> 00:45:14.845
crime application utilizing some

00:45:14.912 --> 00:45:17.014
of those monies to help put in.

00:45:17.081 --> 00:45:18.916
Smart home devices for alarm

00:45:18.982 --> 00:45:21.151
systems Lazar victim to take a

00:45:21.218 --> 00:45:21.718
peek at her house where his

00:45:21.785 --> 00:45:26.890
house before they don't. To see

00:45:26.957 --> 00:45:28.992
someones at my door.

00:45:29.059 --> 00:45:31.195
We are bring technology that's

00:45:31.261 --> 00:45:31.829
out there right now not and I'm

00:45:31.895 --> 00:45:33.063
probably using a brand name I

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:35.032
apologize again not as six seven

00:45:35.099 --> 00:45:37.034
that allows us to see.

00:45:37.101 --> 00:45:39.103
Rings are durable and to

00:45:39.169 --> 00:45:42.639
actually answer them.

00:45:42.706 --> 00:45:44.641
As if we were inside the house.

00:45:44.708 --> 00:45:46.777
But it really is about.

00:45:46.844 --> 00:45:48.812
Everyone getting on the same

00:45:48.879 --> 00:45:49.379
page all of this there it's

00:45:49.446 --> 00:45:50.781
locked changes additions

00:45:50.848 --> 00:45:52.883
etcetera --

00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:55.052
We need federal. To be online

00:45:55.119 --> 00:45:57.154
the state to be online with

00:45:57.221 --> 00:45:58.956
local.

00:45:59.022 --> 00:46:02.893
And for advocates and our police

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:03.560
officers to be working together.

00:46:03.627 --> 00:46:04.862
Multi disciplinary teams I feel

00:46:04.928 --> 00:46:05.529
are so often the solution to so

00:46:05.596 --> 00:46:07.464
many of the issues that we are

00:46:07.531 --> 00:46:07.698
facing.

00:46:07.764 --> 00:46:08.932
And if we have the availability

00:46:08.999 --> 00:46:11.034
to train our officers who want

00:46:11.101 --> 00:46:11.468
to do a good job.

00:46:11.535 --> 00:46:15.005
This is how you care of this

00:46:15.072 --> 00:46:15.205
case.

00:46:15.272 --> 00:46:18.876
They want to do it but just as

00:46:18.942 --> 00:46:19.443
many people in here are tech

00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:24.681
savvy I'm a huge believer grant.

00:46:24.748 --> 00:46:26.950
Grants and grant programs to

00:46:27.017 --> 00:46:28.619
develop --

00:46:28.685 --> 00:46:30.988
Rooms like ago throughout our

00:46:31.054 --> 00:46:31.221
state.

00:46:31.288 --> 00:46:33.257
We are work on and off the

00:46:33.323 --> 00:46:34.992
violence against women Zakaria

00:46:35.058 --> 00:46:35.559
we started one of the first

00:46:35.626 --> 00:46:37.294
threat management teams in the

00:46:37.361 --> 00:46:40.764
state. For an entire county wide.

00:46:40.831 --> 00:46:43.200
And we did that because of the

00:46:43.267 --> 00:46:44.735
we don't do great.

00:46:44.801 --> 00:46:46.870
Now if we wanted to go out and

00:46:46.937 --> 00:46:47.404
train on technology and I

00:46:47.471 --> 00:46:48.071
provide free training across the

00:46:48.138 --> 00:46:50.908
United States simply because of

00:46:50.974 --> 00:46:51.341
the B. W. grant.

00:46:51.408 --> 00:46:53.310
I'm able to talk about now come

00:46:53.377 --> 00:46:54.945
aside strangulation training

00:46:55.012 --> 00:46:58.615
people and things they've never

00:46:58.682 --> 00:46:59.183
heard before or talked about

00:46:59.249 --> 00:47:00.651
before.

00:47:00.717 --> 00:47:02.786
Especially not in the context of

00:47:02.853 --> 00:47:04.821
those who commit mass homicide

00:47:04.888 --> 00:47:06.857
are often actually Stranglers.

00:47:06.924 --> 00:47:07.457
So if we never look at that

00:47:07.524 --> 00:47:09.026
before encouraging people to

00:47:09.092 --> 00:47:11.028
look at those cases and letting

00:47:11.094 --> 00:47:12.863
our officers no hate alive

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:15.065
Stranglers also happen to kill

00:47:15.132 --> 00:47:15.465
police officers.

00:47:15.532 --> 00:47:17.067
Which gives them a lot of

00:47:17.134 --> 00:47:19.102
interest in that as well.

00:47:19.169 --> 00:47:21.205
Too so as we talk about all this

00:47:21.271 --> 00:47:23.173
and I can go out and do all the

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:23.440
training.

00:47:23.507 --> 00:47:24.975
Think of what our officers and

00:47:25.042 --> 00:47:28.812
advocates and community agencies

00:47:28.879 --> 00:47:32.983
could do if we grant money. To

00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:35.085
develop training on technology.

00:47:35.152 --> 00:47:37.120
And to develop assistance

00:47:37.187 --> 00:47:42.960
centers great and work.

00:47:43.026 --> 00:47:44.928
From a law enforcement

00:47:44.995 --> 00:47:46.830
perspective --

00:47:46.897 --> 00:47:47.531
It just took us awhile to figure

00:47:47.598 --> 00:47:49.032
out how to work with it --

00:47:49.099 --> 00:47:49.633
For anybody who doesn't know

00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:50.934
what I'm talking about the

00:47:51.001 --> 00:47:51.401
California electronic

00:47:51.468 --> 00:47:52.669
communications privacy act

00:47:52.736 --> 00:47:53.337
basically says that especially

00:47:53.403 --> 00:47:54.938
as a law enforcement officer.

00:47:55.005 --> 00:47:55.539
If I'm going to go look into

00:47:55.606 --> 00:47:57.174
somebody's phone I have.

00:47:57.241 --> 00:47:59.209
To look specifically into

00:47:59.276 --> 00:48:02.846
certain sections and tell during

00:48:02.913 --> 00:48:05.115
my thank you and tell during my

00:48:05.182 --> 00:48:06.850
search weren't exactly what I

00:48:06.917 --> 00:48:08.885
need to look into that section

00:48:08.952 --> 00:48:10.821
before was basically I have this

00:48:10.887 --> 00:48:11.021
phone.

00:48:11.088 --> 00:48:12.990
I have the phone.

00:48:13.056 --> 00:48:14.992
Now it's great for victims

00:48:15.058 --> 00:48:17.361
because I'm gonna look at a

00:48:17.427 --> 00:48:17.961
victim stone she can give me

00:48:18.028 --> 00:48:21.164
just permission to look at this

00:48:21.231 --> 00:48:22.666
part this part in this part.

00:48:22.733 --> 00:48:23.333
So if you want to share with law

00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:25.068
enforcement what's going on in

00:48:25.135 --> 00:48:26.637
your situation you can provide

00:48:26.703 --> 00:48:27.204
this information to to me.

00:48:27.271 --> 00:48:29.206
And I won't look at stuff maybe

00:48:29.273 --> 00:48:30.841
you don't want to see or maybe a

00:48:30.907 --> 00:48:32.943
barrister concerned about.

00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:33.443
His people should feel

00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:34.678
comfortable.

00:48:34.745 --> 00:48:37.014
Coming in law enforcement not a

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:40.751
free to come along for some --

00:48:40.817 --> 00:48:41.385
But from a suspect perspective I

00:48:41.451 --> 00:48:42.819
need to work just a little bit

00:48:42.886 --> 00:48:44.755
harder in order to determine

00:48:44.821 --> 00:48:45.422
where it can go in that phone.

00:48:45.489 --> 00:48:46.957
And that's fine we can do that

00:48:47.024 --> 00:48:50.927
but that's also part of that

00:48:50.994 --> 00:48:51.561
train so we'd love to be able to

00:48:51.628 --> 00:49:02.906
bring thank you can click.

00:49:02.973 --> 00:49:05.208
Here and next we have.

00:49:05.275 --> 00:49:08.912
Founder and executive director

00:49:08.979 --> 00:49:12.916
of ongoing excellence

00:49:12.983 --> 00:49:13.216
[inaudible]

00:49:13.283 --> 00:49:14.651
Hello everyone.

00:49:14.718 --> 00:49:15.218
I'm lives leave founder and

00:49:15.285 --> 00:49:17.220
executive director of online SO

00:49:17.287 --> 00:49:19.122
us online also last week as a

00:49:19.189 --> 00:49:20.857
nonprofit organization and we

00:49:20.924 --> 00:49:22.926
provide resources to individuals

00:49:22.993 --> 00:49:23.327
and journalists.

00:49:23.393 --> 00:49:24.961
Who have been targeted and

00:49:25.028 --> 00:49:27.030
threatened online who are

00:49:27.097 --> 00:49:28.665
dealing with online harassment?

00:49:28.732 --> 00:49:31.201
And similar to detect the frost

00:49:31.268 --> 00:49:32.803
I was hoping to start to treat

00:49:32.869 --> 00:49:33.437
this as a conversation at the

00:49:33.503 --> 00:49:35.138
beginning of the conversation

00:49:35.205 --> 00:49:37.307
really built on the perspectives

00:49:37.374 --> 00:49:40.911
and questions everyone has

00:49:40.977 --> 00:49:42.679
brought to the table so far.

00:49:42.746 --> 00:49:43.313
Before that I'm happy to give a

00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:45.349
little bit of an introduction

00:49:45.415 --> 00:49:45.682
about myself.

00:49:45.749 --> 00:49:46.850
So -- When I

00:49:46.917 --> 00:49:47.517
graduated from college from the

00:49:47.584 --> 00:49:49.219
university of Pennsylvania with

00:49:49.286 --> 00:49:51.088
honors I moved back to New York

00:49:51.154 --> 00:49:52.923
City to start my first job in

00:49:52.989 --> 00:49:53.190
finance?

00:49:53.256 --> 00:49:54.991
And I was so excited.

00:49:55.058 --> 00:49:57.027
I was green I was ready to take

00:49:57.094 --> 00:49:58.829
on the world.

00:49:58.895 --> 00:50:02.899
When I was actually small

00:50:02.966 --> 00:50:06.737
threatens and extorted online?

00:50:06.803 --> 00:50:08.805
Aspen escalated to my apartment

00:50:08.872 --> 00:50:09.339
door being kicked in by my

00:50:09.406 --> 00:50:14.611
stalker --

00:50:14.678 --> 00:50:16.880
Consider contacting law

00:50:16.947 --> 00:50:17.447
enforcement and ultimately

00:50:17.514 --> 00:50:18.882
didn't I considered getting a

00:50:18.949 --> 00:50:21.051
restraining order but I couldn't

00:50:21.118 --> 00:50:23.186
because I didn't know initially

00:50:23.253 --> 00:50:25.021
who it was [inaudible]

00:50:25.088 --> 00:50:28.759
And you know I've.

00:50:28.825 --> 00:50:31.228
Shared my I probably share my

00:50:31.294 --> 00:50:32.729
story every day through my work

00:50:32.796 --> 00:50:33.296
but one thing I don't share

00:50:33.363 --> 00:50:36.666
actually often and never in a

00:50:36.733 --> 00:50:37.100
public setting is.

00:50:37.167 --> 00:50:39.102
That I did find out who.

00:50:39.169 --> 00:50:42.706
Was behind the harassment --

00:50:42.773 --> 00:50:43.340
Through an I. P. address match

00:50:43.407 --> 00:50:45.308
this is almost a decade ago --

00:50:45.375 --> 00:50:47.043
And so I was on ask Jeeves dot

00:50:47.110 --> 00:50:50.647
com one had existed --

00:50:50.714 --> 00:50:53.049
To figure out how to get to the

00:50:53.116 --> 00:50:55.051
bottom of what was going on and

00:50:55.118 --> 00:50:56.720
it was my ex partner.

00:50:56.787 --> 00:50:59.189
And the reason my ex boyfriend

00:50:59.256 --> 00:51:00.991
and the reason I go and that

00:51:01.057 --> 00:51:04.861
that will impact how on how my

00:51:04.928 --> 00:51:06.897
credibility is viewed --

00:51:06.963 --> 00:51:10.700
But in addition to the stocking

00:51:10.767 --> 00:51:11.368
and extortion there were threats

00:51:11.435 --> 00:51:12.936
to distribute my intimate images

00:51:13.003 --> 00:51:14.671
to my employer --

00:51:14.738 --> 00:51:17.007
And my parents [inaudible]

00:51:17.073 --> 00:51:20.844
And as a high functioning

00:51:20.911 --> 00:51:23.180
independent fairly credible

00:51:23.246 --> 00:51:24.648
person.

00:51:24.714 --> 00:51:26.650
I still.

00:51:26.716 --> 00:51:28.819
Hi this challenges documenting

00:51:28.885 --> 00:51:30.921
what was going on and what I

00:51:30.987 --> 00:51:32.856
later learned in doing this work

00:51:32.923 --> 00:51:34.991
on online harassment is.

00:51:35.058 --> 00:51:35.625
Well their neurological changes

00:51:35.692 --> 00:51:37.360
that happen in when you're in a

00:51:37.427 --> 00:51:38.662
state of emotional distress.

00:51:38.728 --> 00:51:41.097
And so what I want and how that

00:51:41.164 --> 00:51:44.868
has led me to this work I do

00:51:44.935 --> 00:51:45.469
this work I quit my job at

00:51:45.535 --> 00:51:48.805
Morgan Stanley three years ago

00:51:48.872 --> 00:51:50.874
to start online SO us.

00:51:50.941 --> 00:51:53.043
Because I saw the in the new

00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:54.878
cycle.

00:51:54.945 --> 00:51:55.512
Individuals coming forth about

00:51:55.579 --> 00:51:57.247
what was happening to them right

00:51:57.314 --> 00:51:59.115
sometimes this issue feel so

00:51:59.182 --> 00:51:59.749
expansive it's hard to get our

00:51:59.816 --> 00:52:01.251
arms around what's really going

00:52:01.318 --> 00:52:03.253
on you know the cross section

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:05.121
between domestic violence media

00:52:05.188 --> 00:52:09.092
disinformation impersonation all

00:52:09.159 --> 00:52:10.727
of the staff.

00:52:10.794 --> 00:52:14.831
To it is very clear that only

00:52:14.898 --> 00:52:18.635
her Austin's a massive problems

00:52:18.702 --> 00:52:18.935
[inaudible]

00:52:19.002 --> 00:52:21.271
And people are committing

00:52:21.338 --> 00:52:22.806
suicide as a reaction to online

00:52:22.873 --> 00:52:26.843
harassment [inaudible]

00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:30.947
And I couldn't.

00:52:31.014 --> 00:52:32.916
I could I have to stop playing

00:52:32.983 --> 00:52:34.951
small behind my cubicle and

00:52:35.018 --> 00:52:36.820
start sharing not only the human

00:52:36.887 --> 00:52:38.955
story but what could be done.

00:52:39.022 --> 00:52:41.324
And so when we start online SLS

00:52:41.391 --> 00:52:42.826
that we first provided free

00:52:42.893 --> 00:52:44.995
direct service including mental

00:52:45.061 --> 00:52:46.630
health services from a

00:52:46.696 --> 00:52:46.997
professional --

00:52:47.063 --> 00:52:50.934
To anybody dealing with online

00:52:51.001 --> 00:52:52.736
her.

00:52:52.802 --> 00:52:54.971
We've since of all all to

00:52:55.038 --> 00:52:56.907
providing information tactless

00:52:56.973 --> 00:52:59.042
resources on what people can do

00:52:59.109 --> 00:53:00.677
when they need help --

00:53:00.744 --> 00:53:04.848
And building on the third to

00:53:04.915 --> 00:53:05.515
frustrate you were sharing about

00:53:05.582 --> 00:53:06.783
training.

00:53:06.850 --> 00:53:08.985
And law enforcement one to do

00:53:09.052 --> 00:53:09.519
the right thing but it's

00:53:09.586 --> 00:53:10.787
sometimes unclear.

00:53:10.854 --> 00:53:13.123
We talk even today about

00:53:13.189 --> 00:53:14.658
multiple tactics.

00:53:14.724 --> 00:53:15.258
So one of the things that I

00:53:15.325 --> 00:53:19.029
wanted to offer today was.

00:53:19.095 --> 00:53:20.764
The importance of the specifics.

00:53:20.830 --> 00:53:22.966
About the audience the

00:53:23.033 --> 00:53:24.834
constituents the issue that

00:53:24.901 --> 00:53:25.402
they're dealing with which

00:53:25.468 --> 00:53:28.872
sometimes it's multiple tactics.

00:53:28.939 --> 00:53:29.239
But really --

00:53:29.306 --> 00:53:31.007
Be specific about what kind what

00:53:31.074 --> 00:53:35.111
someone access to us moving

00:53:35.178 --> 00:53:36.580
forward.

00:53:36.646 --> 00:53:39.149
Figuring out if we are funding

00:53:39.215 --> 00:53:41.418
online harassment or developing

00:53:41.484 --> 00:53:42.986
grants around that exactly what

00:53:43.053 --> 00:53:46.690
type of toxics will it go.

00:53:46.756 --> 00:53:48.758
To because we're at a point

00:53:48.825 --> 00:53:51.027
where the narrative platforms

00:53:51.094 --> 00:53:51.528
aren't doing enough law

00:53:51.595 --> 00:53:52.896
enforcement isn't doing enough

00:53:52.963 --> 00:53:56.733
that is not actually productive.

00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:58.902
Because and hoping.

00:53:58.969 --> 00:54:00.904
People in crisis we realize they

00:54:00.971 --> 00:54:03.173
won't report done because that

00:54:03.239 --> 00:54:06.776
narrative has been so pervasive.

00:54:06.843 --> 00:54:07.477
And if they won't report them we

00:54:07.544 --> 00:54:09.212
want to really understand what

00:54:09.279 --> 00:54:09.779
they're dealing with what's

00:54:09.846 --> 00:54:14.651
going on and so.

00:54:14.718 --> 00:54:16.920
I wanna be mindful of time and I

00:54:16.987 --> 00:54:18.655
have many things to say.

00:54:18.722 --> 00:54:21.191
But I think that really is my

00:54:21.257 --> 00:54:22.993
own take.

00:54:23.059 --> 00:54:23.560
Away from this discussion.

00:54:23.627 --> 00:54:25.028
And building on what was said so

00:54:25.095 --> 00:54:26.663
far really.

00:54:26.730 --> 00:54:28.665
At the intersection of task.

00:54:28.732 --> 00:54:32.669
Media politics.

00:54:32.736 --> 00:54:34.904
Law enforcement law.

00:54:34.971 --> 00:54:35.572
Now more than ever it's critical

00:54:35.639 --> 00:54:36.673
we come together.

00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:38.975
All the efforts and coalition

00:54:39.042 --> 00:54:41.011
building and being specific and

00:54:41.077 --> 00:54:42.812
getting understanding specific

00:54:42.879 --> 00:54:43.113
use cases.

00:54:43.179 --> 00:54:46.683
And then working towards change.

00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:50.787
I believe is the pathway.

00:54:50.854 --> 00:54:51.421
So thank you so much for your

00:54:51.488 --> 00:54:53.023
time and look forward to

00:54:53.089 --> 00:54:53.556
continuing this discussion

00:54:53.623 --> 00:55:00.730
further.

00:55:00.797 --> 00:55:04.668
Just one comment --

00:55:04.734 --> 00:55:06.770
Those about what you're saying

00:55:06.836 --> 00:55:08.738
about the harassment online --

00:55:08.805 --> 00:55:09.339
I we are public officials and

00:55:09.406 --> 00:55:12.609
we've had several incident --

00:55:12.676 --> 00:55:13.209
Instances lately where we're

00:55:13.276 --> 00:55:15.011
being harassed but it's very

00:55:15.078 --> 00:55:18.748
easy to hide behind the keyboard

00:55:18.815 --> 00:55:20.950
nobody can --

00:55:21.017 --> 00:55:22.786
You know really hold you

00:55:22.852 --> 00:55:25.088
accountable for for those.

00:55:25.155 --> 00:55:27.057
Are is the perception of that

00:55:27.123 --> 00:55:28.992
nobody's gonna hold Burke

00:55:29.059 --> 00:55:31.194
countable for for you doing the

00:55:31.261 --> 00:55:31.561
cyber stalking.

00:55:31.628 --> 00:55:34.964
Are in my case again a public

00:55:35.031 --> 00:55:35.598
official so that's really the

00:55:35.665 --> 00:55:36.866
laws are very different --

00:55:36.933 --> 00:55:39.169
By my fast at the look at the

00:55:39.235 --> 00:55:41.037
comments the look at the

00:55:41.104 --> 00:55:41.304
comments.

00:55:41.371 --> 00:55:42.739
Because they were very very rude

00:55:42.806 --> 00:55:45.141
rude and I mean to the point

00:55:45.208 --> 00:55:46.643
where --

00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:48.778
They would they literally had to

00:55:48.845 --> 00:55:50.747
like not let me look at the

00:55:50.814 --> 00:55:51.047
company --

00:55:51.114 --> 00:55:53.016
By I have --

00:55:53.083 --> 00:55:56.720
The the ability to call upon you

00:55:56.786 --> 00:55:58.888
know we have --

00:55:58.955 --> 00:55:59.522
The CHP that takes care of the

00:55:59.589 --> 00:56:02.926
assembly members we have a tech

00:56:02.992 --> 00:56:03.593
that we call them sergeants and

00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:05.061
at the capital that we can call

00:56:05.128 --> 00:56:07.097
and they're doing a security

00:56:07.163 --> 00:56:08.798
assessment of our offices.

00:56:08.865 --> 00:56:10.734
So we have access to that and

00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:12.836
for folks that don't have access

00:56:12.902 --> 00:56:13.403
I want to thank you for for

00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:14.671
providing that access --

00:56:14.738 --> 00:56:17.006
Because like I said we are have

00:56:17.073 --> 00:56:18.975
the access button most people

00:56:19.042 --> 00:56:22.912
don't and it's very easy. For

00:56:22.979 --> 00:56:28.852
the perpetrator to just hide

00:56:28.918 --> 00:56:31.121
behind their first amendment

00:56:31.187 --> 00:56:33.223
rights really isn't there

00:56:33.289 --> 00:56:34.824
talking [inaudible]

00:56:34.891 --> 00:56:38.795
Taking the I will.

00:56:38.862 --> 00:56:43.133
Being attacked or savings that

00:56:43.199 --> 00:56:44.934
aren't kind to others needs to

00:56:45.001 --> 00:56:46.903
also be address because I think

00:56:46.970 --> 00:56:48.872
we've developed this culture

00:56:48.938 --> 00:56:50.907
that it's like a wall.

00:56:50.974 --> 00:56:52.709
You know if I'm online so it's

00:56:52.776 --> 00:56:54.744
okay and it really is and so

00:56:54.811 --> 00:56:55.178
again thank you --

00:56:55.245 --> 00:56:57.213
For conversation today and then

00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:58.982
so now we have a cat low

00:56:59.048 --> 00:57:03.453
researcher at UC Irvine thank

00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:06.689
you and welcome.

00:57:06.756 --> 00:57:08.792
Yeah -- Yeah

00:57:08.858 --> 00:57:10.794
underserved track university

00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:12.862
help Irvine and my background is

00:57:12.929 --> 00:57:15.265
both a technical issue logical --

00:57:15.331 --> 00:57:19.068
Intriguing and I work as a

00:57:19.135 --> 00:57:20.737
consultant interested safety

00:57:20.804 --> 00:57:22.705
which is typically you know

00:57:22.772 --> 00:57:24.874
issues relating to harassment --

00:57:24.941 --> 00:57:25.542
And so I've been able to sort of

00:57:25.608 --> 00:57:27.177
work and see these issues from

00:57:27.243 --> 00:57:27.811
inside the companies as well as

00:57:27.877 --> 00:57:28.845
doing.

00:57:28.912 --> 00:57:34.684
Crisis support facilitation for

00:57:34.751 --> 00:57:35.218
a target to the views and

00:57:35.285 --> 00:57:36.853
harassment.

00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:40.924
Of which came out of me running

00:57:40.990 --> 00:57:41.558
on link use for women who found

00:57:41.624 --> 00:57:44.928
themselves being targets and

00:57:44.994 --> 00:57:46.896
have the resources at all --

00:57:46.963 --> 00:57:48.765
And so after aggregating enough

00:57:48.832 --> 00:57:50.900
resources we realized --

00:57:50.967 --> 00:57:52.769
Well I guess we should if is a

00:57:52.836 --> 00:57:53.369
resource we should start you

00:57:53.436 --> 00:57:55.438
know Sir deliberately helping

00:57:55.505 --> 00:57:55.705
people --

00:57:55.772 --> 00:57:56.673
And so.

00:57:56.739 --> 00:57:58.942
After doing that work for a

00:57:59.008 --> 00:57:59.576
while the prices were great I

00:57:59.642 --> 00:58:00.944
realized that I wanted to see

00:58:01.010 --> 00:58:03.179
the inside of companies and why

00:58:03.246 --> 00:58:04.848
these decisions are being made.

00:58:04.914 --> 00:58:08.918
About how these platforms for

00:58:08.985 --> 00:58:16.860
for being designed just from the

00:58:16.926 --> 00:58:19.162
stock or from.

00:58:19.229 --> 00:58:20.864
Across platforms and they you

00:58:20.930 --> 00:58:21.397
know reported it on every

00:58:21.464 --> 00:58:23.099
platform and none of them got

00:58:23.166 --> 00:58:23.766
you know they don't know who the

00:58:23.833 --> 00:58:25.001
actions.

00:58:25.068 --> 00:58:28.805
And in what I realized is --

00:58:28.872 --> 00:58:29.439
As she started crying at some

00:58:29.505 --> 00:58:30.940
point I was I was going through

00:58:31.007 --> 00:58:33.076
this with her and like --

00:58:33.142 --> 00:58:34.978
No I am so sorry this is really

00:58:35.044 --> 00:58:37.113
difficult I understand you would

00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:38.615
know I'm crying out of happiness

00:58:38.681 --> 00:58:39.215
because I thought it was going

00:58:39.282 --> 00:58:39.449
crazy.

00:58:39.515 --> 00:58:41.217
Because the way that these

00:58:41.284 --> 00:58:42.619
platforms would consistently

00:58:42.685 --> 00:58:44.687
denied these reports --

00:58:44.754 --> 00:58:48.725
Was sort of a form of like what

00:58:48.791 --> 00:58:49.359
people say plating is you know

00:58:49.425 --> 00:58:51.127
sort of imposing a different

00:58:51.194 --> 00:58:54.898
reality on on of the experiences

00:58:54.964 --> 00:58:56.699
of of this type of harassment --

00:58:56.766 --> 00:58:56.966
And so.

00:58:57.033 --> 00:58:58.835
This isn't actually a single

00:58:58.902 --> 00:58:59.435
story this is a several dozen

00:58:59.502 --> 00:59:02.839
stories you know over the that

00:59:02.906 --> 00:59:03.506
have happened over and over over

00:59:03.573 --> 00:59:04.674
the past.

00:59:04.741 --> 00:59:08.945
Year and a half.

00:59:09.012 --> 00:59:10.813
Year and a half alone is --

00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:14.784
When I with somebody who

00:59:14.851 --> 00:59:15.084
[inaudible]

00:59:15.151 --> 00:59:15.551
And please [inaudible]

00:59:15.618 --> 00:59:20.890
She had we actually documented

00:59:20.957 --> 00:59:22.992
like here shoes very savvy

00:59:23.059 --> 00:59:23.526
engineer to do to document

00:59:23.593 --> 00:59:25.094
everything but when she went to

00:59:25.161 --> 00:59:25.762
the police station they had no

00:59:25.828 --> 00:59:26.996
idea what to do with it and they

00:59:27.063 --> 00:59:28.665
just turned her away --

00:59:28.731 --> 00:59:30.934
And she had no idea what to do

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.303
at that she had no means like

00:59:33.369 --> 00:59:33.937
shouldn't know try to go to a

00:59:34.003 --> 00:59:34.804
lawyer.

00:59:34.871 --> 00:59:36.606
A and there's no guidance there --

00:59:36.673 --> 00:59:36.873
And so.

00:59:36.940 --> 00:59:39.175
You know and they basically said

00:59:39.242 --> 00:59:40.777
like you know just up online

00:59:40.843 --> 00:59:41.344
which is sort of a common

00:59:41.411 --> 00:59:42.645
refrain.

00:59:42.712 --> 00:59:44.881
That doesn't actually work given

00:59:44.948 --> 00:59:45.081
that.

00:59:45.148 --> 00:59:46.749
You know it's a very important

00:59:46.816 --> 00:59:47.350
for both here professional and

00:59:47.417 --> 00:59:48.885
social life to do that --

00:59:48.952 --> 00:59:51.187
And in many cases to be

00:59:51.254 --> 00:59:53.156
connected to your support when

00:59:53.222 --> 00:59:55.024
you have a an abuser.

00:59:55.091 --> 00:59:56.993
A and and this is becoming a

00:59:57.060 --> 01:00:00.697
worse problem there's a two

01:00:00.763 --> 01:00:01.331
thousand seventeen survey by a

01:00:01.397 --> 01:00:02.665
cue.

01:00:02.732 --> 01:00:05.068
That documented in increase in

01:00:05.134 --> 01:00:05.668
people who have and severely

01:00:05.735 --> 01:00:07.136
harassed online which includes

01:00:07.203 --> 01:00:08.671
like sexual harassment.

01:00:08.738 --> 01:00:10.807
Stalking and doctor thing and

01:00:10.873 --> 01:00:11.407
they demonstrated that where

01:00:11.474 --> 01:00:12.909
there's a particular rise --

01:00:12.976 --> 01:00:16.813
Or a particularly high point for

01:00:16.879 --> 01:00:17.413
a younger generation people

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:19.082
between eighteen and twenty five

01:00:19.148 --> 01:00:24.587
so it's it's been getting worse

01:00:24.654 --> 01:00:26.622
it of younger people as well.

01:00:26.689 --> 01:00:28.725
Specially.

01:00:28.791 --> 01:00:30.994
And and so speaking from the

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:32.862
side of working within companies --

01:00:32.929 --> 01:00:34.597
There actually are many

01:00:34.664 --> 01:00:35.264
challenges and many many of the

01:00:35.331 --> 01:00:37.066
people who work on the trust and

01:00:37.133 --> 01:00:39.302
safety team that time companies

01:00:39.369 --> 01:00:39.502
are.

01:00:39.569 --> 01:00:40.036
Very good and very well

01:00:40.103 --> 01:00:40.703
intentioned people who do have a

01:00:40.770 --> 01:00:41.170
lot of education --

01:00:41.237 --> 01:00:42.905
But there are a lot of attention

01:00:42.972 --> 01:00:46.609
with privacy for example the

01:00:46.676 --> 01:00:47.210
challenges you know how do we

01:00:47.276 --> 01:00:50.813
increase.

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:51.414
Does the gathering information

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:55.084
that can be useful for a healthy

01:00:55.151 --> 01:00:55.685
these cases without creasing

01:00:55.752 --> 01:00:58.755
surveillance that can be used by --

01:00:58.821 --> 01:01:00.857
State actors known bad faith --

01:01:00.923 --> 01:01:02.792
Internationally or locally.

01:01:02.859 --> 01:01:04.994
You know being abused by hackers

01:01:05.061 --> 01:01:06.829
and other kinds of compromises

01:01:06.896 --> 01:01:10.666
and and the security of data.

01:01:10.733 --> 01:01:12.668
And so.

01:01:12.735 --> 01:01:13.336
You know a lot of teams are kind

01:01:13.403 --> 01:01:14.971
of stock in there also under

01:01:15.038 --> 01:01:16.572
resource.

01:01:16.639 --> 01:01:17.240
And so one of the things that I

01:01:17.306 --> 01:01:19.409
see is that that I think there

01:01:19.475 --> 01:01:22.779
can be some changes in in the

01:01:22.845 --> 01:01:23.379
tech industry is that there

01:01:23.446 --> 01:01:24.680
right now there's very limited

01:01:24.747 --> 01:01:26.682
escalation infrastructure.

01:01:26.749 --> 01:01:27.316
In the sense that if you have a

01:01:27.383 --> 01:01:29.185
severe case you know it it's

01:01:29.252 --> 01:01:32.588
very difficult to get escalate.

01:01:32.655 --> 01:01:33.222
The systems by these companies

01:01:33.289 --> 01:01:34.757
are designed to be one size fits

01:01:34.824 --> 01:01:37.260
all so you know in there

01:01:37.326 --> 01:01:39.028
moderation their huge scalable

01:01:39.095 --> 01:01:40.930
commercial content moderation

01:01:40.997 --> 01:01:44.901
systems.

01:01:44.967 --> 01:01:49.005
They basically a limited amount

01:01:49.072 --> 01:01:49.672
contact they feel like you know

01:01:49.739 --> 01:01:51.007
the text of the thing that was

01:01:51.074 --> 01:01:52.909
reported.

01:01:52.975 --> 01:01:53.543
And in isolation a lot of the

01:01:53.609 --> 01:01:54.944
time it doesn't look that bad --

01:01:55.011 --> 01:01:55.578
But in aggregate and of being

01:01:55.645 --> 01:01:57.046
far far worse and so there's

01:01:57.113 --> 01:02:00.650
very little interest.

01:02:00.716 --> 01:02:04.687
And I think that if there are

01:02:04.754 --> 01:02:05.088
more resources --

01:02:05.154 --> 01:02:05.655
Allocate to a more pressure

01:02:05.721 --> 01:02:09.192
around this kind of escalation

01:02:09.258 --> 01:02:10.993
that these kind of prophecies.

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:14.964
Of for escalation I think that.

01:02:15.031 --> 01:02:16.799
Would go a great way towards

01:02:16.866 --> 01:02:18.868
addressing these issues with

01:02:18.935 --> 01:02:20.803
severe abuse and harassment --

01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:21.070
And so.

01:02:21.137 --> 01:02:24.907
Right now --

01:02:24.974 --> 01:02:27.176
There's some there are a few

01:02:27.243 --> 01:02:29.278
partnership with the many

01:02:29.345 --> 01:02:29.946
partnership serving former tech

01:02:30.012 --> 01:02:30.847
companies --

01:02:30.913 --> 01:02:33.149
That are you know NGOs non

01:02:33.216 --> 01:02:35.017
profits --

01:02:35.084 --> 01:02:35.651
And I've had to see that --

01:02:35.718 --> 01:02:36.919
Advocacy organizations out but

01:02:36.986 --> 01:02:37.453
right now there's limited

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:42.792
integration you know --

01:02:42.859 --> 01:02:44.827
These organizations see very.

01:02:44.894 --> 01:02:47.029
Little into the operations of

01:02:47.096 --> 01:02:47.530
these tech companies.

01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:48.931
And a very little agency to do

01:02:48.998 --> 01:02:49.599
very much about that so I think

01:02:49.665 --> 01:02:51.167
having more way behind the

01:02:51.234 --> 01:02:54.604
amount of insight of and

01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:56.606
participation they can happen

01:02:56.672 --> 01:02:58.975
that process is very important --

01:02:59.041 --> 01:02:59.542
There's some precedents for

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:02.912
dealing with this --

01:03:02.979 --> 01:03:03.546
Plot have had to build system

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:04.013
for dealing with child

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:04.947
exploitation --

01:03:05.014 --> 01:03:05.548
Materials alongside government

01:03:05.615 --> 01:03:10.853
agents and some social media

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:11.454
platforms of invested more

01:03:11.521 --> 01:03:12.655
training and resources.

01:03:12.722 --> 01:03:15.091
For individuals and specialists

01:03:15.158 --> 01:03:15.625
who actually dig into the

01:03:15.691 --> 01:03:16.859
context.

01:03:16.926 --> 01:03:19.095
Are so that they can sort of

01:03:19.162 --> 01:03:20.830
identifies movies more severe

01:03:20.897 --> 01:03:22.598
cases of abuse.

01:03:22.665 --> 01:03:25.034
And so.

01:03:25.101 --> 01:03:25.701
The recommendations that I would

01:03:25.768 --> 01:03:26.836
I wanted to point out is one is

01:03:26.903 --> 01:03:29.138
one is what not to do is.

01:03:29.205 --> 01:03:30.873
A common response is removing

01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:33.109
and identity right at you know

01:03:33.176 --> 01:03:35.144
making it difficult to have an

01:03:35.211 --> 01:03:37.246
anonymous user names and things

01:03:37.313 --> 01:03:37.547
like that.

01:03:37.613 --> 01:03:39.182
But it is not actually very

01:03:39.248 --> 01:03:42.785
effective solution and actually

01:03:42.852 --> 01:03:44.787
pulls back from the protections

01:03:44.854 --> 01:03:46.656
that people have --

01:03:46.722 --> 01:03:48.691
To avoid abuse so being

01:03:48.758 --> 01:03:50.760
anonymous allows you to escape

01:03:50.826 --> 01:03:53.062
your user and it's been a common

01:03:53.129 --> 01:03:54.964
practice to have a fake name on

01:03:55.031 --> 01:03:55.231
Facebook.

01:03:55.298 --> 01:03:56.732
Stay connected to your support

01:03:56.799 --> 01:03:59.035
network while avoiding your

01:03:59.101 --> 01:03:59.569
views there however that

01:03:59.635 --> 01:04:02.939
violates Facebook's policy.

01:04:03.005 --> 01:04:04.907
And I get taken down and often

01:04:04.974 --> 01:04:06.676
does when the of users find out --

01:04:06.742 --> 01:04:09.378
About if if they find out about

01:04:09.445 --> 01:04:13.182
that account.

01:04:13.249 --> 01:04:15.051
So.

01:04:15.117 --> 01:04:19.322
Really going back to what is

01:04:19.388 --> 01:04:19.922
we need their infrastructure

01:04:19.989 --> 01:04:20.990
prophecies.

01:04:21.057 --> 01:04:21.591
Of both in the relationship

01:04:21.657 --> 01:04:23.392
between law enforcement agencies

01:04:23.459 --> 01:04:26.562
and these platforms --

01:04:26.629 --> 01:04:28.831
These escalation form of

01:04:28.898 --> 01:04:30.733
escalations along side --

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:32.935
Advocacy organizations --

01:04:33.002 --> 01:04:36.906
And I think.

01:04:36.973 --> 01:04:38.841
The end and actually --

01:04:38.908 --> 01:04:40.710
Along to get technical experts

01:04:40.776 --> 01:04:42.945
to and actually your point

01:04:43.012 --> 01:04:45.047
before the technical experts in.

01:04:45.114 --> 01:04:45.681
Of law enforcement agencies to

01:04:45.748 --> 01:04:46.749
do that kind of education so

01:04:46.816 --> 01:04:47.450
that people know what to do with

01:04:47.516 --> 01:04:49.285
these social media --

01:04:49.352 --> 01:04:50.586
Records --

01:04:50.653 --> 01:04:51.187
And what with all the law and

01:04:51.254 --> 01:04:52.622
with all that documentation.

01:04:52.688 --> 01:04:57.059
And online platforms typically

01:04:57.126 --> 01:05:00.663
rely on target to abuse to

01:05:00.730 --> 01:05:02.865
actively advocate for themselves

01:05:02.932 --> 01:05:04.667
and actively report --

01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:07.069
But a lot numerous studies over

01:05:07.136 --> 01:05:09.005
the past couple years have a

01:05:09.071 --> 01:05:10.806
demonstrate about.

01:05:10.873 --> 01:05:12.842
How targeted views choose not to

01:05:12.908 --> 01:05:13.442
report after a period of time

01:05:13.509 --> 01:05:14.977
because of lack of trust the

01:05:15.044 --> 01:05:17.013
platform or fear of?

01:05:17.079 --> 01:05:18.848
Retaliation --

01:05:18.914 --> 01:05:22.785
And often don't understand how

01:05:22.852 --> 01:05:25.054
best report and how that abuses

01:05:25.121 --> 01:05:25.655
even being perpetrated in the

01:05:25.721 --> 01:05:27.123
first place so having more

01:05:27.189 --> 01:05:28.958
proactive means to identify and

01:05:29.025 --> 01:05:29.592
reach out to targets even to

01:05:29.659 --> 01:05:30.926
confirm if this is actually

01:05:30.993 --> 01:05:32.962
happening to them --

01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:35.131
It would be really important

01:05:35.197 --> 01:05:36.666
because right out of many social

01:05:36.732 --> 01:05:37.066
media policies.

01:05:37.133 --> 01:05:40.803
Of require that people report

01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:42.872
first.

01:05:42.938 --> 01:05:43.506
Aye and and I think one of the

01:05:43.572 --> 01:05:46.676
biggest threats to severe --

01:05:46.742 --> 01:05:49.278
Serve targets of severe on

01:05:49.345 --> 01:05:53.115
harassment of of severe online

01:05:53.182 --> 01:05:54.784
harassment have been data

01:05:54.850 --> 01:05:55.051
brokers.

01:05:55.117 --> 01:05:58.788
As a data brokers are --

01:05:58.854 --> 01:06:00.856
Well of the workers are websites

01:06:00.923 --> 01:06:01.457
aggregate public and private

01:06:01.524 --> 01:06:03.259
information where you get it

01:06:03.326 --> 01:06:06.762
there like white pages dot com

01:06:06.829 --> 01:06:08.731
and studio we can pay to get.

01:06:08.798 --> 01:06:09.365
Somebody at yeah address family

01:06:09.432 --> 01:06:11.133
members and everything and so

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:11.667
these these websites --

01:06:11.734 --> 01:06:13.002
Third dozens and dozens of

01:06:13.069 --> 01:06:14.970
popular ones that prop profit

01:06:15.037 --> 01:06:18.941
off of compromising the privacy

01:06:19.008 --> 01:06:19.241
of citizens.

01:06:19.308 --> 01:06:23.112
And the that aggregating

01:06:23.179 --> 01:06:25.314
information and in all of the

01:06:25.381 --> 01:06:25.915
same location and making it

01:06:25.981 --> 01:06:28.918
accessible does decrease the

01:06:28.984 --> 01:06:29.352
effect of privacy.

01:06:29.418 --> 01:06:33.189
Of a citizen and especially of a

01:06:33.255 --> 01:06:34.623
target of abuse --

01:06:34.690 --> 01:06:37.059
It works fine about it in my

01:06:37.126 --> 01:06:39.228
experience is that is easy

01:06:39.295 --> 01:06:40.796
information is often quickly

01:06:40.863 --> 01:06:42.965
updated after you move after you

01:06:43.032 --> 01:06:43.599
take your contact information.

01:06:43.666 --> 01:06:44.700
So a lot of the measures that we

01:06:44.767 --> 01:06:47.036
used to protect people don't

01:06:47.103 --> 01:06:47.603
work because of these data

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:49.038
brokers --

01:06:49.105 --> 01:06:49.572
You can remove a lot of

01:06:49.638 --> 01:06:50.139
information but it cost you

01:06:50.206 --> 01:06:52.942
between a hundred fifteen five

01:06:53.008 --> 01:06:53.542
thousand dollars from services

01:06:53.609 --> 01:06:55.010
and you don't know which ones

01:06:55.077 --> 01:06:56.612
are active.

01:06:56.679 --> 01:07:01.117
So and it it it is well known as

01:07:01.183 --> 01:07:03.052
a mod reviews among --

01:07:03.119 --> 01:07:04.920
Forms online and it's very easy

01:07:04.987 --> 01:07:08.991
to find out about.

01:07:09.058 --> 01:07:11.026
So what what I to the rock hall

01:07:11.093 --> 01:07:13.262
of of for time it is important

01:07:13.329 --> 01:07:14.830
focus on technical education for

01:07:14.897 --> 01:07:16.999
long forces.

01:07:17.066 --> 01:07:17.600
Law enforcement of prophecies

01:07:17.666 --> 01:07:19.101
escalate harassment cases

01:07:19.168 --> 01:07:21.170
resource allocation for trust

01:07:21.237 --> 01:07:22.772
and safety measures --

01:07:22.838 --> 01:07:24.874
And more integrated partnerships

01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:25.508
with advocacy orders not just

01:07:25.574 --> 01:07:26.709
having a partnership --

01:07:26.776 --> 01:07:30.880
And I think and and again

01:07:30.946 --> 01:07:34.784
working on well how do you

01:07:34.850 --> 01:07:35.384
address data brokers had we

01:07:35.451 --> 01:07:36.919
address that this is an easy way

01:07:36.986 --> 01:07:37.253
to profit --

01:07:37.319 --> 01:07:39.054
And is not a regulated in any

01:07:39.121 --> 01:07:40.823
significant way --

01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:42.825
And so I think it's important

01:07:42.892 --> 01:07:43.459
not just a center best practices

01:07:43.526 --> 01:07:46.862
and design prophecies and

01:07:46.929 --> 01:07:48.931
education so that they can of

01:07:48.998 --> 01:07:49.465
all along side how these

01:07:49.532 --> 01:07:50.833
technologies are changing.

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:51.367
In the way that they knew

01:07:51.434 --> 01:07:53.235
harassment and how her after

01:07:53.302 --> 01:07:54.904
learning more sophisticated

01:07:54.970 --> 01:07:57.006
techniques and strategies more

01:07:57.072 --> 01:07:59.074
easily.

01:07:59.141 --> 01:08:01.043
Thank you thank you.

01:08:01.110 --> 01:08:02.812
For the we have --

01:08:02.878 --> 01:08:06.749
Questions or comments I. S. C.

01:08:06.816 --> 01:08:08.851
assembly member --

01:08:08.918 --> 01:08:09.084
Tower --

01:08:09.151 --> 01:08:10.820
Figures being over here I see a

01:08:10.886 --> 01:08:12.721
couple bills coming.

01:08:12.788 --> 01:08:13.355
Onto the privacy committee I can

01:08:13.422 --> 01:08:15.090
I can feel it.

01:08:15.157 --> 01:08:16.826
And I would be honored to

01:08:16.892 --> 01:08:18.994
partner with you on some of

01:08:19.061 --> 01:08:19.562
those so I'm putting it out

01:08:19.628 --> 01:08:19.862
there are.

01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:22.865
So think you if there's no other

01:08:22.932 --> 01:08:23.466
questions I want to thank the

01:08:23.532 --> 01:08:24.700
panel I appreciate --

01:08:24.767 --> 01:08:25.267
You and we look forward to

01:08:25.334 --> 01:08:26.769
working together so that we can

01:08:26.836 --> 01:08:31.307
assist assembly member town was

01:08:31.373 --> 01:08:32.842
built.

01:08:32.908 --> 01:08:34.944
Thank you yes.

01:08:35.010 --> 01:08:36.679
I just.

01:08:36.745 --> 01:08:37.279
Wanted to add one thing in a

01:08:37.346 --> 01:08:39.348
couple resources so the first is

01:08:39.415 --> 01:08:41.016
another interesting place to

01:08:41.083 --> 01:08:42.818
look could be evidence

01:08:42.885 --> 01:08:43.152
preservation.

01:08:43.219 --> 01:08:45.087
So the challenges of evidence

01:08:45.154 --> 01:08:46.655
relation on the target --

01:08:46.722 --> 01:08:47.223
And what kind of evidence.

01:08:47.289 --> 01:08:49.125
Do we need to provide law

01:08:49.191 --> 01:08:50.826
enforcement or to the platform.

01:08:50.893 --> 01:08:54.697
And then there the first is --

01:08:54.763 --> 01:08:57.066
Without my consent.

01:08:57.132 --> 01:08:59.335
And nonprofit organization --

01:08:59.401 --> 01:09:03.005
Focused on actually analyzing

01:09:03.072 --> 01:09:04.673
California domestic violence

01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:06.775
related law has a domestic

01:09:06.842 --> 01:09:08.677
violence restraining order

01:09:08.744 --> 01:09:10.779
digital.

01:09:10.846 --> 01:09:11.013
Chichi.

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:11.280
And so.

01:09:11.347 --> 01:09:12.982
I think it's a great place to

01:09:13.048 --> 01:09:14.950
look and direct people direct

01:09:15.017 --> 01:09:15.184
folks.

01:09:15.251 --> 01:09:17.253
To and then there's been a

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:18.954
couple recent reports that you

01:09:19.021 --> 01:09:20.990
may -- That

01:09:21.056 --> 01:09:21.624
could be helpful to draw from.

01:09:21.690 --> 01:09:24.894
So the United Nations special

01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:26.729
rapporteur on violence against

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:12.868

So Lara's houses the nonprofit

01:11:14.737 --> 01:11:16.872
agency that services victims of

01:11:16.939 --> 01:11:22.878
intimate partner violence --

01:11:22.945 --> 01:11:30.886
Wearable cafe you can process --

01:11:30.953 --> 01:11:32.588
Ensuring that nobody is alone or

01:11:32.655 --> 01:11:34.690
unprepared the day after hearing --

01:11:34.757 --> 01:11:35.290
So this year we're going to

01:11:35.357 --> 01:11:37.359
support nearly twelve hundred

01:11:37.426 --> 01:11:38.827
victims --

01:11:38.894 --> 01:11:40.763
Through this process many of

01:11:40.829 --> 01:11:42.931
them have experience and to

01:11:42.998 --> 01:11:45.334
report to us that they have been

01:11:45.401 --> 01:11:45.868
experiencing some type of

01:11:45.934 --> 01:11:46.802
technology abuse --

01:11:46.869 --> 01:11:49.104
Added peace twelve hundred

01:11:49.171 --> 01:11:50.939
victims would say roughly about

01:11:51.006 --> 01:11:52.675
75% of them.

01:11:52.741 --> 01:11:55.010
Have reported some type of kind

01:11:55.077 --> 01:11:56.712
of you know technology abuse --

01:11:56.779 --> 01:12:00.649
In different ranges so kind of

01:12:00.716 --> 01:12:03.218
the reason for family going to a

01:12:03.285 --> 01:12:04.853
personal story about a client

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:06.655
and kind of what we did to help

01:12:06.722 --> 01:12:07.322
them with the technology issues

01:12:07.389 --> 01:12:08.691
that they were experience.

01:12:08.757 --> 01:12:10.793
But we do believe that victims

01:12:10.859 --> 01:12:12.861
of intimate partner violence or

01:12:12.928 --> 01:12:13.429
people in domestic violence

01:12:13.495 --> 01:12:16.732
relationships are at higher risk --

01:12:16.799 --> 01:12:18.767
Of the perpetrator gaining and

01:12:18.834 --> 01:12:20.569
using this abuse against them

01:12:20.636 --> 01:12:22.905
the reason for this is because

01:12:22.971 --> 01:12:23.572
they're just not some stranger

01:12:23.639 --> 01:12:25.040
who's trained target somebody at

01:12:25.107 --> 01:12:26.909
random --

01:12:26.975 --> 01:12:28.944
It's somebody that the trusted

01:12:29.011 --> 01:12:29.611
at some point somebody who might

01:12:29.678 --> 01:12:31.246
know their personal information

01:12:31.313 --> 01:12:33.415
so this gives the perpetrator

01:12:33.482 --> 01:12:34.917
access to their devices.

01:12:34.983 --> 01:12:37.352
Access to knowing their personal

01:12:37.419 --> 01:12:38.921
security questions to be able to

01:12:38.987 --> 01:12:42.791
answer certain things for them --

01:12:42.858 --> 01:12:46.829
And that puts their devices.

01:12:46.895 --> 01:12:48.597
To use -- So

01:12:48.664 --> 01:12:51.033
with that a compromised device

01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:51.633
that the compromised accounts

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:52.735
can give the perpetrator access

01:12:52.801 --> 01:12:54.937
to the locations are track the

01:12:55.003 --> 01:12:58.640
tracking their their whereabouts.

01:12:58.707 --> 01:12:59.274
So from that they're able to

01:12:59.341 --> 01:13:01.110
sometimes reader text messages

01:13:01.176 --> 01:13:03.045
listen in on conversations even

01:13:03.112 --> 01:13:04.913
access their voice mails.

01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:07.316
As well as sometimes even

01:13:07.382 --> 01:13:08.817
remotely delete evidence from

01:13:08.884 --> 01:13:10.886
their computers are the phones --

01:13:10.953 --> 01:13:11.487
That they might be using for

01:13:11.553 --> 01:13:12.888
this restraining order hearing

01:13:12.955 --> 01:13:14.823
that we're going to be assisting

01:13:14.890 --> 01:13:15.157
them with --

01:13:15.224 --> 01:13:17.059
So with that I do want to talk

01:13:17.126 --> 01:13:18.761
about one specific client that

01:13:18.827 --> 01:13:20.963
comes to mind when we talk about

01:13:21.029 --> 01:13:22.798
technology --

01:13:22.865 --> 01:13:24.900
For the purpose of the story

01:13:24.967 --> 01:13:26.735
let's go ahead and call --

01:13:26.802 --> 01:13:28.971
Thirteen so dean came to us she

01:13:29.037 --> 01:13:29.571
had already petitioned for a

01:13:29.638 --> 01:13:31.073
restraining order.

01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:32.875
And when she got what she had.

01:13:32.941 --> 01:13:38.781
A stock of evidence --

01:13:38.847 --> 01:13:39.081
And it was.

01:13:39.148 --> 01:13:40.749
Screenshot --

01:13:40.816 --> 01:13:43.051
In just personal information on

01:13:43.118 --> 01:13:45.087
her social media accounts school

01:13:45.154 --> 01:13:45.320
change.

01:13:45.387 --> 01:13:47.189
She just didn't understand why

01:13:47.256 --> 01:13:49.391
she would go back change this

01:13:49.458 --> 01:13:51.059
password but the pass which just

01:13:51.126 --> 01:13:53.095
capital change back with

01:13:53.162 --> 01:13:53.428
accounts that.

01:13:53.495 --> 01:13:58.834
Kept getting access into.

01:13:58.901 --> 01:14:00.803
So with that we worked with her

01:14:00.869 --> 01:14:01.470
on resetting the password to her

01:14:01.537 --> 01:14:03.038
accounts but at the end of the

01:14:03.105 --> 01:14:05.040
day did she didn't feel safe.

01:14:05.107 --> 01:14:07.075
With the devices because she was

01:14:07.142 --> 01:14:08.744
already doing this so we work

01:14:08.811 --> 01:14:10.879
with her and do some research on

01:14:10.946 --> 01:14:11.313
these accounts --

01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:12.948
But at the same time.

01:14:13.015 --> 01:14:15.184
While she was worried about her

01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:16.852
social media and online account

01:14:16.919 --> 01:14:17.219
she was also.

01:14:17.286 --> 01:14:18.787
Going to her local grocery

01:14:18.854 --> 01:14:21.123
stores she was going to a local

01:14:21.190 --> 01:14:21.723
Starbucks and her perpetrator

01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:24.860
would appear at these locations.

01:14:24.927 --> 01:14:26.929
So there was. Too much going on

01:14:26.995 --> 01:14:28.931
at once that she decided to kind

01:14:28.997 --> 01:14:32.801
of take herself off line and but

01:14:32.868 --> 01:14:36.738
the beast was still there yes

01:14:36.805 --> 01:14:36.972
talking.

01:14:37.039 --> 01:14:41.243
So access those are garage door

01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:42.811
and she turns to her car and she

01:14:42.878 --> 01:14:43.011
sees.

01:14:43.078 --> 01:14:45.214
A typical little yellow brag

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:47.015
sticking out of the grill of the

01:14:47.082 --> 01:14:47.216
car.

01:14:47.282 --> 01:14:50.619
She went towards the car.

01:14:50.686 --> 01:14:53.088
Took out that yellow right that

01:14:53.155 --> 01:14:55.390
was there and wrapped inside

01:14:55.457 --> 01:14:56.892
that yellow rod.

01:14:56.959 --> 01:14:58.660
Was that I phone.

01:14:58.727 --> 01:14:59.294
The iPhone was connected to her

01:14:59.361 --> 01:15:00.796
car battery.

01:15:00.863 --> 01:15:04.700
And came to the conclusion not

01:15:04.766 --> 01:15:07.069
from this aye full he was using

01:15:07.135 --> 01:15:07.536
the find my location.

01:15:07.603 --> 01:15:09.238
Probably had a software on there

01:15:09.304 --> 01:15:09.838
to be able to track where she

01:15:09.905 --> 01:15:11.206
was and this was the reason why

01:15:11.273 --> 01:15:13.075
he was showing up at every

01:15:13.141 --> 01:15:13.642
location that she was not.

01:15:13.709 --> 01:15:15.043
Whether it be the grocery store

01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:16.812
at the local Starbucks --

01:15:16.879 --> 01:15:18.947
So with that she didn't team

01:15:19.014 --> 01:15:21.216
it's safe to the touch the phone

01:15:21.283 --> 01:15:22.985
from a car right battery in that

01:15:23.051 --> 01:15:24.820
moment still she waited a little

01:15:24.887 --> 01:15:25.053
bit --

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:27.055
Eventually after doing some

01:15:27.122 --> 01:15:28.724
safety parting with advocates --

01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:31.093
We were able to go ahead and

01:15:31.159 --> 01:15:31.693
remove that before one of her

01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:32.728
hearing --

01:15:32.794 --> 01:15:38.700
But at the end of the day.

01:15:38.767 --> 01:15:41.069
It was the question how we need

01:15:41.136 --> 01:15:41.670
the court was going to answer

01:15:41.737 --> 01:15:42.704
the question how do you know.

01:15:42.771 --> 01:15:45.007
That it's this person that

01:15:45.073 --> 01:15:47.309
fooled the cities tortilla --

01:15:47.376 --> 01:15:48.977
Luckily with hers that was a

01:15:49.044 --> 01:15:51.079
really easy solution because the

01:15:51.146 --> 01:15:54.716
very first thing perpetrators

01:15:54.783 --> 01:15:56.818
email address on there.

01:15:56.885 --> 01:15:56.985
So.

01:15:57.052 --> 01:15:59.288
That was an easy case but at the

01:15:59.354 --> 01:16:02.758
end of the yeah I think it comes

01:16:02.824 --> 01:16:03.358
down to you know meeting with

01:16:03.425 --> 01:16:05.193
the client so when we met with

01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:07.062
her we assisted her in helping

01:16:07.129 --> 01:16:08.931
our children passwords --

01:16:08.997 --> 01:16:09.498
We also did research on her

01:16:09.564 --> 01:16:10.966
account --

01:16:11.033 --> 01:16:13.135
But everything still kept

01:16:13.201 --> 01:16:14.870
getting changed back so.

01:16:14.937 --> 01:16:16.939
After with last week partner

01:16:17.005 --> 01:16:17.406
actually with a local

01:16:17.472 --> 01:16:19.074
cybersecurity company and I feel

01:16:19.141 --> 01:16:20.876
that back something that is very

01:16:20.943 --> 01:16:22.678
beneficial.

01:16:22.744 --> 01:16:26.848
To advocates and agencies work.

01:16:26.915 --> 01:16:27.282
None of us had any.

01:16:27.349 --> 01:16:29.117
Knowledge of what was going on

01:16:29.184 --> 01:16:31.019
with tech because we're not tax

01:16:31.086 --> 01:16:33.121
ID some of us might be some of

01:16:33.188 --> 01:16:33.522
us might not be.

01:16:33.588 --> 01:16:35.123
But we have a local

01:16:35.190 --> 01:16:36.925
cybersecurity company actually

01:16:36.992 --> 01:16:38.927
come and do some extensive

01:16:38.994 --> 01:16:41.063
training with us and teaching us

01:16:41.129 --> 01:16:42.965
what fishing was what.

01:16:43.031 --> 01:16:45.033
Hacking is and we actually got a

01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:46.935
full expense knowledge and we

01:16:47.002 --> 01:16:47.569
created helpless to be able to

01:16:47.636 --> 01:16:48.870
provide to our clients.

01:16:48.937 --> 01:16:50.906
And showing them and actually

01:16:50.973 --> 01:16:53.175
determining if their phone a

01:16:53.241 --> 01:16:53.575
safer unsafe --

01:16:53.642 --> 01:16:56.845
So with her specifically we

01:16:56.912 --> 01:16:58.580
actually helped her --

01:16:58.647 --> 01:16:58.814
Reese --

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:03.218
Completely your first and this

01:17:03.285 --> 01:17:04.853
is work we did with her --

01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:07.055
Because she had tried going to

01:17:07.122 --> 01:17:08.623
police and they would be like

01:17:08.690 --> 01:17:09.257
but how do you know it's this

01:17:09.324 --> 01:17:11.193
person doing this when she would

01:17:11.259 --> 01:17:12.694
children screenshots on

01:17:12.761 --> 01:17:14.830
everything bloom Chiu --

01:17:14.896 --> 01:17:16.965
But that we did the factory

01:17:17.032 --> 01:17:17.599
resets with her and from there

01:17:17.666 --> 01:17:19.001
we work in educating her on the

01:17:19.067 --> 01:17:19.334
site where --

01:17:19.401 --> 01:17:21.169
Applications that were out there

01:17:21.236 --> 01:17:22.838
to try to maintain her devices

01:17:22.904 --> 01:17:24.873
safe -- From

01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:25.507
not once everything was done

01:17:25.574 --> 01:17:27.142
eventually she did come back

01:17:27.209 --> 01:17:30.912
online she alone here in

01:17:30.979 --> 01:17:31.513
California all her family was

01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:32.781
out of state and our

01:17:32.848 --> 01:17:33.382
communication was to face the

01:17:33.448 --> 01:17:34.883
with everybody else --

01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:36.885
But without we also educated her

01:17:36.952 --> 01:17:39.154
on how to keep her account see

01:17:39.221 --> 01:17:40.989
from here on out --

01:17:41.056 --> 01:17:42.891
And if we wouldn't of had this

01:17:42.958 --> 01:17:45.327
chain personally I think it

01:17:45.394 --> 01:17:45.927
would have been a little bit

01:17:45.994 --> 01:17:46.695
harder for us to prepare for it

01:17:46.762 --> 01:17:49.231
to continue on with her life and

01:17:49.297 --> 01:17:49.598
feeling safe.

01:17:49.664 --> 01:17:50.966
Our social media accounts on the

01:17:51.033 --> 01:17:52.734
internet --

01:17:52.801 --> 01:17:54.770
So we educated her on the two

01:17:54.836 --> 01:17:56.738
factor authentication and on a

01:17:56.805 --> 01:17:59.207
password reset feel not just

01:17:59.274 --> 01:18:00.909
specifically what's your laptop

01:18:00.976 --> 01:18:03.011
when somebody can go on to your

01:18:03.078 --> 01:18:03.645
profile I just find your high

01:18:03.712 --> 01:18:05.247
school in the know your mascot.

01:18:05.313 --> 01:18:07.082
So we did this education portion

01:18:07.149 --> 01:18:08.850
with her --

01:18:08.917 --> 01:18:10.819
From there the client did end of

01:18:10.886 --> 01:18:12.821
obtaining her restraining order

01:18:12.888 --> 01:18:13.522
and eventually criminal case was

01:18:13.588 --> 01:18:16.758
open but it wasn't in regards.

01:18:16.825 --> 01:18:17.392
To the happy it was in regards

01:18:17.459 --> 01:18:18.994
to everything else it was

01:18:19.061 --> 01:18:20.729
because of the violations that

01:18:20.796 --> 01:18:21.196
were happening in the

01:18:21.263 --> 01:18:22.864
restraining order and him

01:18:22.931 --> 01:18:24.666
showing up at these locations.

01:18:24.733 --> 01:18:28.870
But from there --

01:18:28.937 --> 01:18:32.774
Center they're telling me that

01:18:32.841 --> 01:18:33.375
she's doing great nobody has

01:18:33.442 --> 01:18:35.243
been going into her counsel she

01:18:35.310 --> 01:18:36.978
actually feel safe on the

01:18:37.045 --> 01:18:38.713
internet out --

01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:42.684
But with that.

01:18:42.751 --> 01:18:44.786
I think some tools.

01:18:44.853 --> 01:18:45.353
That we often see with our

01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:45.854
clients one of the most

01:18:45.921 --> 01:18:46.855
challenges is going to be.

01:18:46.922 --> 01:18:50.859
You know being able to tie this

01:18:50.926 --> 01:18:52.661
evidence to vote of users --

01:18:52.727 --> 01:18:53.295
For example I know one time I

01:18:53.361 --> 01:18:54.896
was in court and there was

01:18:54.963 --> 01:18:56.765
somebody that actually worked in

01:18:56.832 --> 01:18:58.934
law enforcement trying to obtain

01:18:59.000 --> 01:18:59.534
a restraining order and they

01:18:59.601 --> 01:19:00.735
have all the resources they were

01:19:00.802 --> 01:19:02.804
showing I. P. address as they

01:19:02.871 --> 01:19:03.138
were showing.

01:19:03.205 --> 01:19:04.906
How they knew it was the

01:19:04.973 --> 01:19:07.175
perpetrator versus somebody that

01:19:07.242 --> 01:19:08.610
comes to you know --

01:19:08.677 --> 01:19:10.979
And a local agency we have

01:19:11.046 --> 01:19:13.181
access to resources but it tends

01:19:13.248 --> 01:19:15.217
to be limited at times so we try

01:19:15.283 --> 01:19:17.119
to do as much as we can with --

01:19:17.185 --> 01:19:19.087
Even try to find with us it's

01:19:19.154 --> 01:19:20.989
great that we have this

01:19:21.056 --> 01:19:21.523
partnership where we can

01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:22.924
actually even communicate with

01:19:22.991 --> 01:19:25.026
them and after moved on the full

01:19:25.093 --> 01:19:25.327
assessment.

01:19:25.393 --> 01:19:27.129
If it's still not safe will send

01:19:27.195 --> 01:19:27.829
the device over to the city --

01:19:27.896 --> 01:19:29.097
Cybersecurity company but a lot

01:19:29.164 --> 01:19:31.433
of agencies and people that are

01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:33.068
doing this on their own don't

01:19:33.135 --> 01:19:34.936
have access to these things --

01:19:35.003 --> 01:19:37.139
But I really think it comes down

01:19:37.205 --> 01:19:38.673
to being.

01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:40.976
Providing that education portion

01:19:41.042 --> 01:19:41.510
to advocates to local law

01:19:41.576 --> 01:19:44.779
enforcement.

01:19:44.846 --> 01:19:48.884
To anybody possible to try.

01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:50.785
To let them know how once to the

01:19:50.852 --> 01:19:53.221
internet and to have to take all

01:19:53.288 --> 01:19:54.990
these precautions.

01:19:55.056 --> 01:19:56.858
Because at the end of the day.

01:19:56.925 --> 01:19:59.294
Why should they have to do this

01:19:59.361 --> 01:19:59.628
even though?

01:19:59.694 --> 01:20:02.764
The abuses occurring --

01:20:02.831 --> 01:20:03.198
But with that so.

01:20:03.265 --> 01:20:05.000
I just wanted to say thank you

01:20:05.066 --> 01:20:06.902
for having me as a before

01:20:06.968 --> 01:20:08.970
allowing me to show my

01:20:09.037 --> 01:20:16.912
experience with claims.

01:20:16.978 --> 01:20:21.316
Thank you rate on next to her.

01:20:21.383 --> 01:20:22.918
Job [inaudible]

01:20:22.984 --> 01:20:25.220
Q. -- Thank

01:20:25.287 --> 01:20:26.755
you for the opportunity to give

01:20:26.821 --> 01:20:29.157
my statement and a little about

01:20:29.224 --> 01:20:30.859
the intersections on domestic

01:20:30.926 --> 01:20:32.894
violence that knowledge and

01:20:32.961 --> 01:20:33.261
immigration --

01:20:33.328 --> 01:20:34.696
And the new grand experience as

01:20:34.763 --> 01:20:35.197
we start moving towards

01:20:35.263 --> 01:20:36.998
solutions I think is important

01:20:37.065 --> 01:20:37.265
to also.

01:20:37.332 --> 01:20:38.967
Take into consideration that

01:20:39.034 --> 01:20:43.038
different community access

01:20:43.104 --> 01:20:44.773
technology differently.

01:20:44.839 --> 01:20:46.975
My name is judgment I and I'm

01:20:47.042 --> 01:20:47.576
the social services program

01:20:47.642 --> 01:20:49.110
manager with the taxi just a

01:20:49.177 --> 01:20:50.679
center.

01:20:50.745 --> 01:20:51.346
In my row at the diary I oversee

01:20:51.413 --> 01:20:53.014
the social services program as

01:20:53.081 --> 01:20:54.849
well as support survivors with

01:20:54.916 --> 01:20:55.483
case management counseling and

01:20:55.550 --> 01:20:56.851
referrals.

01:20:56.918 --> 01:20:58.920
I first are working with

01:20:58.987 --> 01:20:59.588
immigrant survivors of domestic

01:20:59.654 --> 01:21:02.757
violence in two thousand and

01:21:02.824 --> 01:21:05.093
five and have since work in both

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:08.663
east and west the center is a

01:21:08.730 --> 01:21:10.665
national nonprofit the uses

01:21:10.732 --> 01:21:11.233
holistic approach providing

01:21:11.299 --> 01:21:12.801
legal.

01:21:12.867 --> 01:21:13.268
And social services

01:21:13.335 --> 01:21:14.936
representation for immigrants

01:21:15.003 --> 01:21:18.607
undocumented immigrants victims

01:21:18.673 --> 01:21:19.174
off gender based violence.

01:21:19.241 --> 01:21:21.243
We also do public education and

01:21:21.309 --> 01:21:22.644
advocacy.

01:21:22.711 --> 01:21:25.247
Our mission is to protect

01:21:25.313 --> 01:21:27.215
courageous immigrant women and

01:21:27.282 --> 01:21:28.850
girls who refused to be victims

01:21:28.917 --> 01:21:30.719
of violence by elevating their

01:21:30.785 --> 01:21:32.821
voices in your communities.

01:21:32.887 --> 01:21:34.856
Courts and Congress. 71% of to

01:21:34.923 --> 01:21:36.825
hurry clients have experienced

01:21:36.891 --> 01:21:38.760
domestic violence.

01:21:38.827 --> 01:21:39.261
Nearly half have also

01:21:39.327 --> 01:21:40.929
experienced a very different

01:21:40.996 --> 01:21:42.764
forms of abuse.

01:21:42.831 --> 01:21:44.799
Immigrant women are tK times

01:21:44.866 --> 01:21:46.901
more likely to experience

01:21:46.968 --> 01:21:47.435
domestic violence and the

01:21:47.502 --> 01:21:50.972
general public. 72% of abusive

01:21:51.039 --> 01:21:53.041
partners fail to give there's

01:21:53.108 --> 01:21:54.709
thousands of legal status any

01:21:54.776 --> 01:21:56.778
use that as a tool of control.

01:21:56.845 --> 01:21:58.713
One out of five better immigrant

01:21:58.780 --> 01:22:01.116
women site immigration

01:22:01.182 --> 01:22:04.653
consequences at the fear reason

01:22:04.719 --> 01:22:05.153
for leaving the adhesive

01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:05.487
relationship.

01:22:05.553 --> 01:22:06.888
It is also important to

01:22:06.955 --> 01:22:08.823
recognize the domestic violence

01:22:08.890 --> 01:22:10.558
among immigrant and refugee

01:22:10.625 --> 01:22:11.192
populations are not rooted in

01:22:11.259 --> 01:22:12.961
the specific cultures.

01:22:13.028 --> 01:22:16.965
But in part Cherokee and

01:22:17.032 --> 01:22:18.800
oppression.

01:22:18.867 --> 01:22:19.401
In addition they immigration

01:22:19.467 --> 01:22:22.904
experience is often Rio in

01:22:22.971 --> 01:22:23.171
violent.

01:22:23.238 --> 01:22:24.706
Abuse extortion and the

01:22:24.773 --> 01:22:26.875
different forms of trauma.

01:22:26.941 --> 01:22:29.110
Post immigration stressors can

01:22:29.177 --> 01:22:30.712
have impact in family dynamics

01:22:30.779 --> 01:22:33.181
and create the conditions for a

01:22:33.248 --> 01:22:33.715
domestic violence with a

01:22:33.782 --> 01:22:36.651
immigrant and refugee population.

01:22:36.718 --> 01:22:38.987
Leadership thank the Grayson

01:22:39.054 --> 01:22:39.287
process --

01:22:39.354 --> 01:22:40.655
Is impacted by many factors.

01:22:40.722 --> 01:22:43.058
In kicking can call socialize

01:22:43.124 --> 01:22:46.928
the isolation limited English a

01:22:46.995 --> 01:22:48.830
language proficiency can limited

01:22:48.897 --> 01:22:51.066
access to resources and when we

01:22:51.132 --> 01:22:52.701
talk about --

01:22:52.767 --> 01:22:54.936
Language access is important to

01:22:55.003 --> 01:22:57.005
also that to talk about it is

01:22:57.072 --> 01:22:58.907
not just about.

01:22:58.973 --> 01:22:59.507
Foreign languages and English

01:22:59.574 --> 01:23:00.909
technology itself is the

01:23:00.975 --> 01:23:03.144
language I sometimes a struggle

01:23:03.211 --> 01:23:04.679
with.

01:23:04.746 --> 01:23:05.313
Some off the terms that we had

01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:07.082
been using here so that's

01:23:07.148 --> 01:23:08.917
something that we have. To take

01:23:08.983 --> 01:23:10.885
into consideration as well when

01:23:10.952 --> 01:23:12.821
doing --

01:23:12.887 --> 01:23:14.723
Community outreach --

01:23:14.789 --> 01:23:16.825
We also most of most observe how

01:23:16.891 --> 01:23:18.626
institutions and systems off

01:23:18.693 --> 01:23:19.160
technology are rooted in

01:23:19.227 --> 01:23:20.895
privilege.

01:23:20.962 --> 01:23:22.831
I first learned about the term

01:23:22.897 --> 01:23:23.365
she's you know divide.

01:23:23.431 --> 01:23:25.300
On a study conducted by the

01:23:25.367 --> 01:23:27.102
center for justice Lawrence and

01:23:27.168 --> 01:23:29.003
community at the university of

01:23:29.070 --> 01:23:30.905
California Santa Cruz.

01:23:30.972 --> 01:23:31.473
They thirty highlighted how

01:23:31.539 --> 01:23:34.809
access and use of technology

01:23:34.876 --> 01:23:36.611
tends to zero social economic

01:23:36.678 --> 01:23:36.945
disparities.

01:23:37.011 --> 01:23:39.280
And those disparities my further

01:23:39.347 --> 01:23:40.682
reduce opportunities for

01:23:40.749 --> 01:23:42.884
immigrants to adopt

01:23:42.951 --> 01:23:43.385
technological skills.

01:23:43.451 --> 01:23:45.353
Another thirty conducted by the

01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:46.988
university of southern

01:23:47.055 --> 01:23:47.589
California foundation grants

01:23:47.655 --> 01:23:49.157
have a higher ownership of

01:23:49.224 --> 01:23:50.859
mobile device.

01:23:50.925 --> 01:23:51.426
The lower for computer and

01:23:51.493 --> 01:23:54.863
internet access per household.

01:23:54.929 --> 01:23:56.698
Latino immigrants also have the

01:23:56.765 --> 01:23:59.000
lowest rate of computer

01:23:59.067 --> 01:24:01.069
ownership for household --

01:24:01.136 --> 01:24:02.971
When compared to white US born

01:24:03.037 --> 01:24:08.643
Latinos and Asian immigrants?

01:24:08.710 --> 01:24:13.081
80000370% of 40% of foreign born

01:24:13.148 --> 01:24:14.582
Latinos on the computer.

01:24:14.649 --> 01:24:18.853
Another thirty conducted in

01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:19.187
200-020-0012.

01:24:19.254 --> 01:24:20.722
By the welcome center the

01:24:20.789 --> 01:24:22.857
welcome center for the new

01:24:22.924 --> 01:24:23.191
Pennsylvania.

01:24:23.258 --> 01:24:24.826
Found that when it comes to

01:24:24.893 --> 01:24:27.061
immigrants personal use of

01:24:27.128 --> 01:24:27.395
social media.

01:24:27.462 --> 01:24:28.830
Texting has an overwhelming

01:24:28.897 --> 01:24:30.865
prevalence 95% of the

01:24:30.932 --> 01:24:33.234
respondents reported using their

01:24:33.301 --> 01:24:34.969
mobile phones to send text

01:24:35.036 --> 01:24:36.805
message.

01:24:36.871 --> 01:24:38.606
If this number is significantly

01:24:38.673 --> 01:24:40.975
higher than the percentage of US

01:24:41.042 --> 01:24:42.677
adults --

01:24:42.744 --> 01:24:44.913
Cellphone users that overall is

01:24:44.979 --> 01:24:47.081
about 73%.

01:24:47.148 --> 01:24:49.017
More than half 58% say that they

01:24:49.083 --> 01:24:51.252
do so often and those who say

01:24:51.319 --> 01:24:53.021
they never sent that.

01:24:53.087 --> 01:24:55.089
Text messages were all --

01:24:55.156 --> 01:24:58.993
Eight all forty or older forty

01:24:59.060 --> 01:25:00.762
years old or older.

01:25:00.829 --> 01:25:01.429
In that same parking demographic

01:25:01.496 --> 01:25:02.997
to keep in mind when you are

01:25:03.064 --> 01:25:04.732
working with folks from

01:25:04.799 --> 01:25:08.870
different ages and backgrounds.

01:25:08.937 --> 01:25:09.404
We also see clients where

01:25:09.471 --> 01:25:11.005
children are the ones support

01:25:11.072 --> 01:25:12.941
their parents with the

01:25:13.007 --> 01:25:14.709
communications via text or

01:25:14.776 --> 01:25:15.143
electronic devices.

01:25:15.210 --> 01:25:17.145
This is something the provider

01:25:17.212 --> 01:25:17.612
should consider when

01:25:17.679 --> 01:25:18.980
communicating with clients doing

01:25:19.047 --> 01:25:21.049
outreach or also thinking on

01:25:21.115 --> 01:25:22.684
different like.

01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:26.554
Ways to use evidence --

01:25:26.621 --> 01:25:28.857
Or communicate with clients.

01:25:28.923 --> 01:25:31.292
As expected many immigrants use

01:25:31.359 --> 01:25:32.861
social media to communicate with

01:25:32.927 --> 01:25:34.996
their support systems back home --

01:25:35.063 --> 01:25:38.833
44% of the easy grams Condit

01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:39.434
responded on their report.

01:25:39.501 --> 01:25:41.035
Say they use mobile phones for

01:25:41.102 --> 01:25:45.139
the show the nine one stop.

01:25:45.206 --> 01:25:47.075
However the general knowledge of

01:25:47.141 --> 01:25:48.977
self when you use seems to state

01:25:49.043 --> 01:25:52.614
limited to those applications --

01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:53.181
We work with clients that

01:25:53.248 --> 01:25:56.885
although they use Facebook Daly

01:25:56.951 --> 01:25:57.552
what's that daily when we have

01:25:57.619 --> 01:25:59.020
to talk about different safety

01:25:59.087 --> 01:26:00.989
deep so different.

01:26:01.055 --> 01:26:03.057
Technological applications so

01:26:03.124 --> 01:26:03.691
you get is that can help then

01:26:03.758 --> 01:26:04.993
they need some additional

01:26:05.059 --> 01:26:06.995
support in that area --

01:26:07.061 --> 01:26:11.032
Is my limited to communication.

01:26:11.099 --> 01:26:11.733
Are we still have a long way to

01:26:11.799 --> 01:26:12.800
go when it comes.

01:26:12.867 --> 01:26:15.069
To our community education on

01:26:15.136 --> 01:26:16.871
technology and technology access

01:26:16.938 --> 01:26:18.907
itself --

01:26:18.973 --> 01:26:19.440
But he can be a pearl out

01:26:19.507 --> 01:26:20.875
process --

01:26:20.942 --> 01:26:23.344
We can do some safe work towards

01:26:23.411 --> 01:26:24.679
safety improvement.

01:26:24.746 --> 01:26:27.215
And also on evidence gathering

01:26:27.282 --> 01:26:28.650
as well --

01:26:28.716 --> 01:26:29.284
All the issues are you related

01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:31.252
to how it use use technologies

01:26:31.319 --> 01:26:33.421
as to of control and I don't get

01:26:33.488 --> 01:26:34.956
into because I think many folks

01:26:35.023 --> 01:26:36.991
here highlighted that as well --

01:26:37.058 --> 01:26:38.993
We have also seen a lot of

01:26:39.060 --> 01:26:40.895
social media is intimidation one

01:26:40.962 --> 01:26:42.697
thing that I can hear you today.

01:26:42.764 --> 01:26:44.966
Is -- The

01:26:45.033 --> 01:26:48.770
LGBTQ community and their

01:26:48.836 --> 01:26:50.805
partners and social media to

01:26:50.872 --> 01:26:51.406
their families when they have

01:26:51.472 --> 01:26:53.007
not done you know that's a very

01:26:53.074 --> 01:26:53.441
brutal way to take.

01:26:53.508 --> 01:26:55.209
Something from you --

01:26:55.276 --> 01:26:56.878
Also -- We

01:26:56.945 --> 01:26:58.980
must reveal legal procedures for

01:26:59.047 --> 01:27:01.115
survivors to get electronic

01:27:01.182 --> 01:27:02.984
properties on a track in a

01:27:03.051 --> 01:27:03.351
timely manner.

01:27:03.418 --> 01:27:04.852
Up for example I am myself a

01:27:04.919 --> 01:27:07.155
survivor off domestic violence

01:27:07.221 --> 01:27:08.923
when I first immigrated to do

01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:10.892
not stays in.

01:27:10.959 --> 01:27:11.492
Two thousand four I ended up

01:27:11.559 --> 01:27:12.961
having to go to a better shelter

01:27:13.027 --> 01:27:15.129
in the last name only with the

01:27:15.196 --> 01:27:15.597
clothing on my back.

01:27:15.663 --> 01:27:17.432
And in order for me to go back

01:27:17.498 --> 01:27:19.000
and get my electronics I had to

01:27:19.067 --> 01:27:21.369
go up life for a restraining

01:27:21.436 --> 01:27:23.004
order wait thirty days in order

01:27:23.071 --> 01:27:25.139
to have a judge. To then have a

01:27:25.206 --> 01:27:26.874
shared go you'll get at least

01:27:26.941 --> 01:27:28.776
all your properties.

01:27:28.843 --> 01:27:29.444
And by the time the perpetrator

01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:31.312
had already had access to the

01:27:31.379 --> 01:27:33.081
computer on my password to reach

01:27:33.147 --> 01:27:35.083
out to a family had.

01:27:35.149 --> 01:27:36.751
Gotten to my email accounts so I

01:27:36.818 --> 01:27:39.354
think you know the legislative

01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:40.955
like I I really appreciate this

01:27:41.022 --> 01:27:41.623
opportunity because will be good

01:27:41.689 --> 01:27:42.890
to look into a way.

01:27:42.957 --> 01:27:46.728
That survivors can get access to

01:27:46.794 --> 01:27:48.930
their properties one uses the

01:27:48.997 --> 01:27:50.632
one that state of the house or

01:27:50.698 --> 01:27:55.269
that user has control over their

01:27:55.336 --> 01:27:58.906
properties --

01:27:58.973 --> 01:28:00.975
Yeah so I'm just honored that

01:28:01.042 --> 01:28:03.077
the California party she to an

01:28:03.144 --> 01:28:03.745
the mystic violence asked me to

01:28:03.811 --> 01:28:04.012
be here.

01:28:04.078 --> 01:28:05.146
And I hope to continue to

01:28:05.213 --> 01:28:06.881
contribute to efforts to help

01:28:06.948 --> 01:28:07.548
discuss wrote to the roots off.

01:28:07.615 --> 01:28:08.750
Domestic violence in our

01:28:08.816 --> 01:28:10.685
communities and creating my

01:28:10.752 --> 01:28:14.889
protections just survivors.

01:28:14.956 --> 01:28:20.762
Thank.

01:28:20.828 --> 01:28:21.262
I also have the story.

01:28:21.329 --> 01:28:23.131
Pop up when you are talking --

01:28:23.197 --> 01:28:24.632
And you know with everything

01:28:24.699 --> 01:28:25.266
that's going on with the federal

01:28:25.333 --> 01:28:25.733
system and all of the

01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:26.901
immigration --

01:28:26.968 --> 01:28:27.301
Controversies --

01:28:27.368 --> 01:28:28.803
There was a case where --

01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:30.872
Eighty documented --

01:28:30.938 --> 01:28:34.842
Husband had an undocumented --

01:28:34.909 --> 01:28:37.245
Beat her and said if you know if

01:28:37.311 --> 01:28:38.846
you do anything I'm going to go

01:28:38.913 --> 01:28:39.180
to the party.

01:28:39.247 --> 01:28:41.315
And eventually started --

01:28:41.382 --> 01:28:44.919
Abusing the children as well and

01:28:44.986 --> 01:28:45.153
saying.

01:28:45.219 --> 01:28:46.621
What do you get a deal and so --

01:28:46.688 --> 01:28:48.990
It is very difficult especially

01:28:49.057 --> 01:28:50.858
with the situation that's going

01:28:50.925 --> 01:28:52.794
on on federally by.

01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:55.029
It's hard to point --

01:28:55.096 --> 01:28:56.597
To some of these services

01:28:56.664 --> 01:28:58.766
because I think a lot of our our

01:28:58.833 --> 01:29:01.069
immigrant communities are free

01:29:01.135 --> 01:29:01.602
of point of coming forward

01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:05.073
because of the different things

01:29:05.139 --> 01:29:06.641
that are going on and so.

01:29:06.708 --> 01:29:07.275
I know that now more than ever

01:29:07.341 --> 01:29:09.343
we need your support and

01:29:09.410 --> 01:29:12.880
services to to be I'd.

01:29:12.947 --> 01:29:13.548
Aye immigrant communities and no

01:29:13.614 --> 01:29:14.749
believe it or not --

01:29:14.816 --> 01:29:17.118
Even if they are documented the

01:29:17.185 --> 01:29:19.020
perpetrators --

01:29:19.087 --> 01:29:20.955
Somehow brain washed the victim

01:29:21.022 --> 01:29:23.157
into thinking that they have

01:29:23.224 --> 01:29:24.926
power over their immigration

01:29:24.992 --> 01:29:26.994
status so even if they're

01:29:27.061 --> 01:29:27.628
documented I've heard them say

01:29:27.695 --> 01:29:29.163
well you only documented because

01:29:29.230 --> 01:29:30.832
I allowed it so I did a moment I

01:29:30.898 --> 01:29:32.934
can call and take it away.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.036
And if you're not educated and

01:29:35.103 --> 01:29:36.904
have no idea.

01:29:36.971 --> 01:29:40.842
And being very basically a slave

01:29:40.908 --> 01:29:42.543
to the perpetrator because

01:29:42.610 --> 01:29:44.645
you're just trying to maintain

01:29:44.712 --> 01:29:45.313
your your life and maintain your

01:29:45.379 --> 01:29:47.248

relations unity is free from

01:31:21.042 --> 01:31:22.910
sexual domestic and

01:31:22.977 --> 01:31:24.679
interpersonal violence --

01:31:24.745 --> 01:31:27.048
I oversee our prevention

01:31:27.114 --> 01:31:27.582
department at peace over

01:31:27.648 --> 01:31:29.116
violence which includes a lot of

01:31:29.183 --> 01:31:30.785
activities for youth education

01:31:30.852 --> 01:31:33.054
and youth leadership development.

01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:34.622
We provide violence prevention

01:31:34.689 --> 01:31:36.858
education in the classrooms for

01:31:36.924 --> 01:31:37.158
students --

01:31:37.225 --> 01:31:39.193
We do leadership programs like

01:31:39.260 --> 01:31:40.962
our students together organizing

01:31:41.028 --> 01:31:42.930
peace program in schools our

01:31:42.997 --> 01:31:44.632
summer youth over violence

01:31:44.699 --> 01:31:46.734
institute an internship program

01:31:46.801 --> 01:31:47.368
and we help provide spaces for

01:31:47.435 --> 01:31:50.671
intergenerational conversations.

01:31:50.738 --> 01:31:52.874
Between young people and adults

01:31:52.940 --> 01:31:53.507
to talk about building healthy

01:31:53.574 --> 01:31:54.976
relationships so I want to say

01:31:55.042 --> 01:31:57.111
thank you again not just for

01:31:57.178 --> 01:31:57.712
having the space to talk about

01:31:57.778 --> 01:31:58.946
this really important

01:31:59.013 --> 01:32:00.948
conversation.

01:32:01.015 --> 01:32:01.582
But really ensuring that youth

01:32:01.649 --> 01:32:03.217
and prevention are part of these

01:32:03.284 --> 01:32:04.852
conversations.

01:32:04.919 --> 01:32:06.988
On unfortunately teen dating

01:32:07.054 --> 01:32:08.856
violence is something that

01:32:08.923 --> 01:32:10.958
happens and it's not often

01:32:11.025 --> 01:32:11.592
talked about as part of these

01:32:11.659 --> 01:32:12.660
broader conversation about

01:32:12.727 --> 01:32:15.129
domestic violence --

01:32:15.196 --> 01:32:16.964
And it's often not taken

01:32:17.031 --> 01:32:18.833
seriously in a lot of times just

01:32:18.900 --> 01:32:21.102
kind of label teenage drama --

01:32:21.168 --> 01:32:22.904
But we know that according to

01:32:22.970 --> 01:32:24.939
the National Council on crime

01:32:25.006 --> 01:32:26.908
and delinquency actually one in

01:32:26.974 --> 01:32:28.709
three young people deal with

01:32:28.776 --> 01:32:31.145
some kind of of violence from

01:32:31.212 --> 01:32:32.980
their dating partners whether

01:32:33.047 --> 01:32:34.849
that be sexual emotional verbal

01:32:34.916 --> 01:32:35.116
physical.

01:32:35.182 --> 01:32:36.784
Or digital --

01:32:36.851 --> 01:32:37.418
And women and girls between the

01:32:37.485 --> 01:32:39.320
ages of sixteen and twenty four

01:32:39.387 --> 01:32:41.322
actually experience the highest

01:32:41.389 --> 01:32:43.057
rates of intimate partner

01:32:43.124 --> 01:32:45.326
violence which is three times

01:32:45.393 --> 01:32:46.794
above the national average.

01:32:46.861 --> 01:32:49.096
On and you know that I can have

01:32:49.163 --> 01:32:50.731
lifelong effects on young people

01:32:50.798 --> 01:32:51.365
are not only when it comes to

01:32:51.432 --> 01:32:53.100
their mental health but then

01:32:53.167 --> 01:32:55.102
sometimes becoming adult.

01:32:55.169 --> 01:32:59.106
Victims of domestic violence

01:32:59.173 --> 01:33:00.675
after.

01:33:00.741 --> 01:33:04.879
Social media can two teen dating

01:33:04.946 --> 01:33:06.747
violence occurring --

01:33:06.814 --> 01:33:08.983
There's a correlation that when --

01:33:09.050 --> 01:33:10.651
Some sort of cyber or digital

01:33:10.718 --> 01:33:12.853
abuse is happening within a

01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:13.521
relationship that there is also

01:33:13.587 --> 01:33:16.924
physical and sexual violence

01:33:16.991 --> 01:33:17.558
company so that could be an

01:33:17.625 --> 01:33:19.160
indicator to kind of look.

01:33:19.226 --> 01:33:20.895
And see and dig deeper as to

01:33:20.962 --> 01:33:21.395
what's occurring in the

01:33:21.462 --> 01:33:22.997
relationship --

01:33:23.064 --> 01:33:23.531
We know that things like

01:33:23.597 --> 01:33:25.066
Instagram and Snapchat and other

01:33:25.132 --> 01:33:27.201
forms of social media can be

01:33:27.268 --> 01:33:28.970
used to create an environment

01:33:29.036 --> 01:33:30.905
that's threatening or

01:33:30.972 --> 01:33:32.807
intimidating in order to control

01:33:32.873 --> 01:33:34.809
that person's partner --

01:33:34.875 --> 01:33:35.443
And that social media can feel

01:33:35.509 --> 01:33:37.178
relentless it can be anonymous

01:33:37.244 --> 01:33:38.980
you can feel inescapable and

01:33:39.046 --> 01:33:41.115
like someone mentioned earlier

01:33:41.182 --> 01:33:42.750
we've seen unfortunately people

01:33:42.817 --> 01:33:45.186
and people across the country

01:33:45.252 --> 01:33:47.221
die by suicide because of the

01:33:47.288 --> 01:33:50.891
pressures put on by social media --

01:33:50.958 --> 01:33:51.559
And it kind of makes sense the

01:33:51.625 --> 01:33:52.927
appeal of social media can

01:33:52.994 --> 01:33:54.929
actually really --

01:33:54.996 --> 01:33:56.630
Correlate to what's happening

01:33:56.697 --> 01:33:58.799
during that period of adolescent

01:33:58.866 --> 01:33:59.467
development and what's happening

01:33:59.533 --> 01:34:01.235
in the brain so we think about

01:34:01.302 --> 01:34:02.970
what young people are dealing

01:34:03.037 --> 01:34:04.805
with and they're experiencing

01:34:04.872 --> 01:34:06.741
you know there's this need. To

01:34:06.807 --> 01:34:09.043
have peer influence to feel like

01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:10.811
they're fitting and they want to

01:34:10.878 --> 01:34:12.913
appear more mature they're

01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:13.447
figuring out who they are

01:34:13.514 --> 01:34:15.116
they're really looking at

01:34:15.182 --> 01:34:17.051
sensation seeking activities.

01:34:17.118 --> 01:34:19.353
And they get a lot out of this

01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:20.855
instant gratification all things

01:34:20.921 --> 01:34:22.957
that social media are really

01:34:23.024 --> 01:34:24.692
really good at providing on and

01:34:24.759 --> 01:34:27.061
what we also see is that success

01:34:27.128 --> 01:34:28.996
can come from technology and

01:34:29.063 --> 01:34:30.698
social media.

01:34:30.765 --> 01:34:31.332
I don't know if any of you ever

01:34:31.399 --> 01:34:33.167
watch the MTV movie awards or

01:34:33.234 --> 01:34:34.769
anything like that in the past

01:34:34.835 --> 01:34:36.971
but like I was watching it this

01:34:37.038 --> 01:34:37.638
year I didn't know like half of

01:34:37.705 --> 01:34:39.006
those stars.

01:34:39.073 --> 01:34:40.674
Because their YouTube

01:34:40.741 --> 01:34:41.308
celebrities they're celebrities

01:34:41.375 --> 01:34:43.210
from Instagram they're seeing

01:34:43.277 --> 01:34:46.981
that they can become successful

01:34:47.048 --> 01:34:48.716
and get some satisfaction from

01:34:48.783 --> 01:34:50.851
being popular and famous using

01:34:50.918 --> 01:34:56.924
social media --

01:34:56.991 --> 01:35:00.861
But I don't want to just the

01:35:00.928 --> 01:35:02.630
Mason -- So

01:35:02.696 --> 01:35:04.765
there's a place.

01:35:04.832 --> 01:35:06.901
For community organizing on

01:35:06.967 --> 01:35:07.468
social media if we look at

01:35:07.535 --> 01:35:09.036
things like the parkland

01:35:09.103 --> 01:35:11.205
survivors baking using social

01:35:11.272 --> 01:35:12.973
media as a platform to legislate

01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:15.009
or ask for legislation when it

01:35:15.076 --> 01:35:16.777
comes to gun control.

01:35:16.844 --> 01:35:19.046
On and as was mentioned earlier

01:35:19.113 --> 01:35:19.313
actually.

01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:21.215
A lot of mass violence can be

01:35:21.282 --> 01:35:22.983
connected to domestic violence

01:35:23.050 --> 01:35:25.286
over 50% of the mass shootings

01:35:25.352 --> 01:35:25.920
that have happened have had a

01:35:25.986 --> 01:35:27.021
connection to domestic violence

01:35:27.088 --> 01:35:29.023
and I think that in some of

01:35:29.090 --> 01:35:29.356
these cases.

01:35:29.423 --> 01:35:31.125
Including park when there's a

01:35:31.192 --> 01:35:32.993
case to be made but teen dating

01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:34.862
violence was a contributing

01:35:34.929 --> 01:35:36.964
factor to what happened we also

01:35:37.031 --> 01:35:38.866
see the need to movement which

01:35:38.933 --> 01:35:39.467
was started by Toronto Burke

01:35:39.533 --> 01:35:40.968
fifty years ago.

01:35:41.035 --> 01:35:43.270
But has really exploded once it

01:35:43.337 --> 01:35:45.172
came on to social media and

01:35:45.239 --> 01:35:47.208
became that hash tag I'm so we

01:35:47.274 --> 01:35:49.376
know we can look at things like

01:35:49.443 --> 01:35:51.112
the why I stayed hash tag right

01:35:51.178 --> 01:35:51.278
so.

01:35:51.345 --> 01:35:53.280
Social media and technology can

01:35:53.347 --> 01:35:56.684
be a place to get people to have

01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:57.318
these conversations to bring.

01:35:57.384 --> 01:35:58.953
Of stories to let to give

01:35:59.019 --> 01:36:01.222
survivors of boys to advocate on

01:36:01.288 --> 01:36:03.090
behalf of themselves.

01:36:03.157 --> 01:36:04.725
So peace over violence we've

01:36:04.792 --> 01:36:05.326
done this in different ways

01:36:05.392 --> 01:36:07.294
argues created a campaign called

01:36:07.361 --> 01:36:08.863
make a choice --

01:36:08.929 --> 01:36:10.865
Where they're utilizing social

01:36:10.931 --> 01:36:13.134
media and technology to spread

01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:15.102
this message of make a choice to

01:36:15.169 --> 01:36:17.138
build healthy relationships and

01:36:17.204 --> 01:36:18.873
to be an up Stander and say

01:36:18.939 --> 01:36:19.540
something and do something when

01:36:19.607 --> 01:36:20.908
you see?

01:36:20.975 --> 01:36:22.710
On healthy things happening --

01:36:22.776 --> 01:36:25.079
Are you posted online Twitter

01:36:25.146 --> 01:36:26.947
tax where they create their own

01:36:27.014 --> 01:36:28.682
memes and hash tags to create a

01:36:28.749 --> 01:36:31.118
dialogue to be able to ask

01:36:31.185 --> 01:36:32.653
questions and answer questions

01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:35.055
for other people about issues of

01:36:35.122 --> 01:36:35.556
teen dating violence.

01:36:35.623 --> 01:36:41.362
And we got we can also see how

01:36:41.428 --> 01:36:41.762
inter [inaudible]

01:36:41.829 --> 01:36:46.667
Lake Road respect dot org --

01:36:46.734 --> 01:36:47.268
That's not cool dot com where

01:36:47.334 --> 01:36:49.203
teams can go if they have

01:36:49.270 --> 01:36:50.938
questions and resources because

01:36:51.005 --> 01:36:53.174
unfortunately one thing we also

01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:55.342
know is that young people don't

01:36:55.409 --> 01:36:56.911
often go to adults in their

01:36:56.977 --> 01:36:59.146
lives to ask for help or to get

01:36:59.213 --> 01:37:00.981
resources and so these are safe

01:37:01.048 --> 01:37:01.215
places.

01:37:01.282 --> 01:37:03.184
And some of these places even

01:37:03.250 --> 01:37:04.985
offer instead of hot lines like

01:37:05.052 --> 01:37:06.720
many of us run chaplain.

01:37:06.787 --> 01:37:09.156
Where young people can interact

01:37:09.223 --> 01:37:09.690
with somebody and you get

01:37:09.757 --> 01:37:10.991
immediate help like?

01:37:11.058 --> 01:37:12.960
I'm so I think it's important

01:37:13.027 --> 01:37:14.929
that we look at ways to utilize

01:37:14.995 --> 01:37:17.164
social media and not just look

01:37:17.231 --> 01:37:18.933
at it as something that you are

01:37:18.999 --> 01:37:20.834
going to use social media

01:37:20.901 --> 01:37:22.903
whether or not we tell them

01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:24.738
they're allowed to use it or not.

01:37:24.805 --> 01:37:26.974
We as adults use social media

01:37:27.041 --> 01:37:28.709
every day and are not going to

01:37:28.776 --> 01:37:29.276
just throw it away because

01:37:29.343 --> 01:37:31.111
someone tells us that it's bad.

01:37:31.178 --> 01:37:32.947
So we need to teach you how to

01:37:33.013 --> 01:37:34.682
use social media safely.

01:37:34.748 --> 01:37:36.917
And how to communicate

01:37:36.984 --> 01:37:38.719
effectively and responsibly on

01:37:38.786 --> 01:37:40.854
any to help.

01:37:40.921 --> 01:37:42.723
Them identify strategies for

01:37:42.790 --> 01:37:44.825
using social media to create

01:37:44.892 --> 01:37:47.061
social change like we've seen

01:37:47.127 --> 01:37:48.896
happening on any to help build

01:37:48.963 --> 01:37:50.931
upon legislation like the

01:37:50.998 --> 01:37:52.766
California healthy youth act.

01:37:52.833 --> 01:37:54.835
And help mandate prevention

01:37:54.902 --> 01:37:56.937
education in the classrooms and

01:37:57.004 --> 01:37:59.039
schools and expanded to looking

01:37:59.106 --> 01:38:00.975
at best practices for

01:38:01.041 --> 01:38:02.676
interventions and response

01:38:02.743 --> 01:38:03.177
policies so that it.

01:38:03.244 --> 01:38:05.312
Teen dating violence or sexual

01:38:05.379 --> 01:38:06.714
violence is happening and is

01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:09.049
affecting students we know and

01:38:09.116 --> 01:38:11.218
teachers know and administrators

01:38:11.285 --> 01:38:12.686
know exactly how they can

01:38:12.753 --> 01:38:13.220
respond to those to keep

01:38:13.287 --> 01:38:15.055
students safe --

01:38:15.122 --> 01:38:16.724
And we can use this because

01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:19.059
schools are where students learn

01:38:19.126 --> 01:38:20.661
and so this needs to be the

01:38:20.728 --> 01:38:21.262
place where they're learning

01:38:21.328 --> 01:38:22.830
about how to have healthy

01:38:22.896 --> 01:38:23.197
relationships.

01:38:23.264 --> 01:38:25.266
How to healthy how to have

01:38:25.332 --> 01:38:26.967
healthy communication with folks

01:38:27.034 --> 01:38:28.936
include parents in the

01:38:29.003 --> 01:38:29.570
conversation so that they know

01:38:29.637 --> 01:38:31.038
how to talk to their children

01:38:31.105 --> 01:38:32.673
about these issues?

01:38:32.740 --> 01:38:37.044
On and just really create an

01:38:37.111 --> 01:38:38.879
environment that.

01:38:38.946 --> 01:38:40.814
So thank you so.

01:38:40.881 --> 01:38:44.852
Talk about young six of this

01:38:44.918 --> 01:38:49.056
conversation [inaudible]

01:38:49.123 --> 01:38:50.824
Thank you.

01:38:50.891 --> 01:38:53.294
The bill comes aye Chau Eggman

01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:53.894
with many of you I was former

01:38:53.961 --> 01:38:57.131
teacher I taught for sixteen

01:38:57.197 --> 01:38:57.665
years and you know it.

01:38:57.731 --> 01:38:59.099
At the conversation is great by

01:38:59.166 --> 01:39:02.870
reality it's difficult as first

01:39:02.936 --> 01:39:03.504
of all of the parents are to be

01:39:03.570 --> 01:39:05.105
able to address these issues

01:39:05.172 --> 01:39:07.374
with with students if you don't

01:39:07.441 --> 01:39:08.742
know -- Or

01:39:08.809 --> 01:39:10.911
you don't have access --

01:39:10.978 --> 01:39:12.579
To what the the kids are doing

01:39:12.646 --> 01:39:15.015
and so the education and of that

01:39:15.082 --> 01:39:16.950
the from --

01:39:17.017 --> 01:39:18.686
The detective with the education

01:39:18.752 --> 01:39:20.954
of not officers but in this case

01:39:21.021 --> 01:39:21.555
education of teachers and and

01:39:21.622 --> 01:39:22.990
school personnel --

01:39:23.057 --> 01:39:24.892
By.

01:39:24.958 --> 01:39:28.896
Even the education of parents by

01:39:28.962 --> 01:39:31.298
my not question but more of a

01:39:31.365 --> 01:39:32.966
general comment is if the

01:39:33.033 --> 01:39:35.135
parents are those.

01:39:35.202 --> 01:39:36.770
Are victims of domestic violence

01:39:36.837 --> 01:39:38.906
the kids are seen as it doesn't

01:39:38.972 --> 01:39:42.710
feel practical --

01:39:42.776 --> 01:39:44.845
To go to you know to the school

01:39:44.912 --> 01:39:46.947
sometimes again if there is no

01:39:47.014 --> 01:39:49.116
education by difficult like I

01:39:49.183 --> 01:39:49.583
said I was a teacher.

01:39:49.650 --> 01:39:52.753
Kids are not --

01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:53.120
Very [inaudible]

01:39:53.187 --> 01:39:54.722
Trusting --

01:39:54.788 --> 01:39:58.692
Because there's a B..

01:39:58.759 --> 01:40:00.961
Real possibility that the social

01:40:01.028 --> 01:40:02.696
media will be taken away.

01:40:02.763 --> 01:40:04.765
And so they're having to balance

01:40:04.832 --> 01:40:06.800
the do I come forward.

01:40:06.867 --> 01:40:08.802
Right which obviously unless

01:40:08.869 --> 01:40:11.004
there's like one you know get

01:40:11.071 --> 01:40:11.305
some help.

01:40:11.372 --> 01:40:12.940
But they are so I don't see a

01:40:13.006 --> 01:40:14.975
ticket their ticket we're all

01:40:15.042 --> 01:40:17.077
addicted social media and so a

01:40:17.144 --> 01:40:17.678
lot of times they're they're

01:40:17.745 --> 01:40:18.612
faced with.

01:40:18.679 --> 01:40:20.981
If I say something then the

01:40:21.048 --> 01:40:22.716
social media is going to the

01:40:22.783 --> 01:40:25.018
ones that are supposed to stop

01:40:25.085 --> 01:40:26.787
doing what we're doing in order

01:40:26.854 --> 01:40:27.321
to prevent the violence.

01:40:27.388 --> 01:40:28.722
And so.

01:40:28.789 --> 01:40:30.891
I would like to work with you a

01:40:30.958 --> 01:40:31.525
little bit more I'm trying to

01:40:31.592 --> 01:40:32.826
figure out --

01:40:32.893 --> 01:40:36.630
A balance between.

01:40:36.697 --> 01:40:38.966
The case chaired by trying to

01:40:39.032 --> 01:40:39.633
remove the stigma or trying to

01:40:39.700 --> 01:40:41.335
remove the possibility of the

01:40:41.402 --> 01:40:42.803
social media being taken away so

01:40:42.870 --> 01:40:45.339
I look for to to working with

01:40:45.406 --> 01:40:45.606
all with.

01:40:45.672 --> 01:40:46.840
All of you on again future

01:40:46.907 --> 01:40:48.776
legislation by if anything --

01:40:48.842 --> 01:40:51.145
Conversations I do have brown

01:40:51.211 --> 01:40:52.613
tables with my superintendents

01:40:52.679 --> 01:40:52.880
levels --

01:40:52.946 --> 01:40:55.249
Where it doesn't cost anything

01:40:55.315 --> 01:40:56.884
to at least have a conversation

01:40:56.950 --> 01:40:59.052
with the superintendent and

01:40:59.119 --> 01:40:59.553
maybe come up with --

01:40:59.620 --> 01:41:00.988
Some kind of a policy because

01:41:01.054 --> 01:41:04.925
the team and we've all been here

01:41:04.992 --> 01:41:05.559
the whole morning the theme as

01:41:05.626 --> 01:41:06.693
we need more resources on

01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:08.862
fortunately.

01:41:08.929 --> 01:41:10.631
You know that's not always

01:41:10.697 --> 01:41:11.231
possible or I can't addresses

01:41:11.298 --> 01:41:13.300
legislators say okay yeah here

01:41:13.367 --> 01:41:16.770
you go I've we had a big battle

01:41:16.837 --> 01:41:17.438
over an additional just twenty

01:41:17.504 --> 01:41:18.739
million dollars --

01:41:18.806 --> 01:41:20.674
To help --

01:41:20.741 --> 01:41:22.876
You know in cases like this and

01:41:22.943 --> 01:41:24.745
it was a huge battle we ask for

01:41:24.812 --> 01:41:25.312
fifty and we ended up with

01:41:25.379 --> 01:41:26.880
twenty but it took.

01:41:26.947 --> 01:41:31.051
Literally the whole entire year

01:41:31.118 --> 01:41:34.721
of battling here you.

01:41:34.788 --> 01:41:36.957
But there are reality is that

01:41:37.024 --> 01:41:37.458
it's not going to be --

01:41:37.524 --> 01:41:40.828
As easy and so if what my ask

01:41:40.894 --> 01:41:41.528
would be is help me come up with

01:41:41.595 --> 01:41:42.663
alternatives --

01:41:42.729 --> 01:41:46.867
In lieu of the funding because

01:41:46.934 --> 01:41:48.869
funding is always the battle by.

01:41:48.936 --> 01:41:51.405
Again I have brown tables with

01:41:51.472 --> 01:41:52.806
my superintendent how can we

01:41:52.873 --> 01:41:54.942
bring some of these programs are

01:41:55.008 --> 01:41:55.509
in the conversations to the

01:41:55.576 --> 01:41:56.810
school through.

01:41:56.877 --> 01:41:59.012
You know for example me or those

01:41:59.079 --> 01:41:59.580
of you that live in other

01:41:59.646 --> 01:42:01.048
assembly district to bring them

01:42:01.114 --> 01:42:03.116
to the assembly members and I

01:42:03.183 --> 01:42:04.852
would love to be a conduit.

01:42:04.918 --> 01:42:05.419
Between my colleagues in

01:42:05.486 --> 01:42:06.954
Sacramento because everything

01:42:07.020 --> 01:42:09.156
cost money and we don't have the

01:42:09.223 --> 01:42:10.824
money and so I would like to

01:42:10.891 --> 01:42:12.793
also be a resource. To you and

01:42:12.860 --> 01:42:13.460
give me information as to what I

01:42:13.527 --> 01:42:15.262
can tell my colleagues up and

01:42:15.329 --> 01:42:16.697
down the state.

01:42:16.763 --> 01:42:19.066
The thing if I could just just

01:42:19.132 --> 01:42:20.734
about your comment about the

01:42:20.801 --> 01:42:22.703
state of mind used to be.

01:42:22.769 --> 01:42:30.878
Will coming for any one of the

01:42:30.944 --> 01:42:32.813
is a set up.

01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:34.915
Conversation but it just makes

01:42:34.982 --> 01:42:36.984
me think about issues of sexual

01:42:37.050 --> 01:42:37.618
violence that where alcohol is

01:42:37.684 --> 01:42:38.886
involved right and there's this

01:42:38.952 --> 01:42:39.453
fear that if I come forward

01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:40.854
because I've been drinking.

01:42:40.921 --> 01:42:41.522
You know especially if I'm under

01:42:41.588 --> 01:42:42.189
age what might happen and so I

01:42:42.256 --> 01:42:43.290
think it's kind of a parallel

01:42:43.357 --> 01:42:43.957
conversation that we can look at

01:42:44.024 --> 01:42:44.791
some strategies in those cases

01:42:44.858 --> 01:42:45.425
and apply it perhaps to social

01:42:45.492 --> 01:42:46.627
media.

01:42:46.693 --> 01:42:48.962
Thank you thank you very much

01:42:49.029 --> 01:42:54.835

01:43:39.746 --> 01:43:40.714

01:44:32.766 --> 01:44:34.768
And to five again teenage

01:44:34.835 --> 01:44:38.905
violence that exists within

01:44:38.972 --> 01:44:40.741
their own my I think communities --

01:44:40.807 --> 01:44:41.341
We have are you the by three

01:44:41.408 --> 01:44:42.943

01:44:43.010 --> 01:44:44.745
Member on our board we have you

01:44:48.982 --> 01:44:49.549
school to fifty schools where we

01:44:49.616 --> 01:44:50.617
are.

01:44:50.684 --> 01:44:51.284
Advertising at the come together

01:44:51.351 --> 01:44:53.120
the committee and they learn

01:44:53.186 --> 01:44:54.888
about the ins and outs of the

01:44:54.955 --> 01:44:55.589
nineteen eighty one is the Civic --

01:44:55.656 --> 01:44:57.290
They learn how to be leaders as

01:44:57.357 --> 01:44:58.592
well we host a leads training

01:44:58.659 --> 01:45:00.894
and to learn advocates do --

01:45:00.961 --> 01:45:01.461
In their communities and be

01:45:01.528 --> 01:45:03.296
advocates on their own campuses

01:45:03.363 --> 01:45:04.931
where it really has sparked into --

01:45:04.998 --> 01:45:05.599
Creative club that I just spoke

01:45:05.666 --> 01:45:07.367
about on their own campuses and

01:45:07.434 --> 01:45:10.904
how they can create policies

01:45:10.971 --> 01:45:12.906
within their own schools --

01:45:12.973 --> 01:45:15.142
We also have had teams utilize --

01:45:15.208 --> 01:45:17.210
You too bye creating PSA --

01:45:17.277 --> 01:45:19.312
We provide them with the tools

01:45:19.379 --> 01:45:19.980
that we just ask them how can we

01:45:20.047 --> 01:45:20.914
help you really want to put the

01:45:20.981 --> 01:45:21.481
power in their hands of what

01:45:21.548 --> 01:45:24.951
story that in the current --

01:45:25.018 --> 01:45:25.552
Like the wanted to be able to

01:45:25.619 --> 01:45:27.320
share that experience through

01:45:27.387 --> 01:45:28.755
that as well.

01:45:28.822 --> 01:45:31.091
And then we also utilize the

01:45:31.158 --> 01:45:32.693
technology platform with our

01:45:32.759 --> 01:45:33.326
team tax help line that we just

01:45:33.393 --> 01:45:36.830
recently started --

01:45:36.897 --> 01:45:37.497
Why we began this help one was

01:45:37.564 --> 01:45:39.399
the car because he saw there was

01:45:39.466 --> 01:45:42.769
a definite need --

01:45:42.836 --> 01:45:43.403
For something else I need --

01:45:43.470 --> 01:45:45.539
Not being met for resource wise

01:45:45.605 --> 01:45:46.640
but are you --

01:45:46.707 --> 01:45:47.207
There is a lot of ways we

01:45:47.274 --> 01:45:47.841
definitely heard of verbally in

01:45:47.908 --> 01:45:48.809
the classroom just discussion

01:45:48.875 --> 01:45:50.811
back and forth but I thought

01:45:50.877 --> 01:45:51.211
kind of the more.

01:45:51.278 --> 01:45:53.146
Physical evidence within our pre

01:45:53.213 --> 01:45:55.082
surveys that we provide to our

01:45:55.148 --> 01:45:55.682
youth at the beginning of our

01:45:55.749 --> 01:45:57.050
course.

01:45:57.117 --> 01:45:57.718
I'm with those free surveys are

01:45:57.784 --> 01:45:59.052
typically done some kind of meet

01:45:59.119 --> 01:45:59.586
them where they're at and

01:45:59.653 --> 01:46:01.054
there's a question I asked you

01:46:01.121 --> 01:46:01.621
know the resources that are

01:46:01.688 --> 01:46:02.856
available to you in your

01:46:02.923 --> 01:46:08.929
community.

01:46:08.995 --> 01:46:09.596
And over 80% of them stated now.

01:46:09.663 --> 01:46:10.897
So -- We

01:46:10.964 --> 01:46:11.565
definitely thought it is kind of

01:46:11.631 --> 01:46:13.233
a general need their so with

01:46:13.300 --> 01:46:14.735
that data.

01:46:14.801 --> 01:46:15.268
Only were able to kind of

01:46:15.335 --> 01:46:17.137
explore on ways we can help them

01:46:17.204 --> 01:46:19.072
I'm eliminate that kind of bare

01:46:19.139 --> 01:46:20.941
year.

01:46:21.007 --> 01:46:22.709
And as we all know the ins and

01:46:22.776 --> 01:46:23.343
as well the does the marketing

01:46:23.410 --> 01:46:25.078
they're very connected to their

01:46:25.145 --> 01:46:25.712
phone so to me it's more of a

01:46:25.779 --> 01:46:27.214
space for them --

01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:29.149
So with that we are able to sign

01:46:29.216 --> 01:46:30.984
in and increasing data for them

01:46:31.051 --> 01:46:31.651
by providing a better service to

01:46:31.718 --> 01:46:32.719
them -- With

01:46:32.786 --> 01:46:34.788
that tailored service specific --

01:46:34.855 --> 01:46:38.825
The a service that might.

01:46:38.892 --> 01:46:40.694
I'm just a little history of

01:46:40.761 --> 01:46:42.829
that he had his own experience

01:46:42.896 --> 01:46:44.731
to work with domestic violence

01:46:44.798 --> 01:46:45.165
so he understood the

01:46:45.232 --> 01:46:45.766
confidentiality in the safety

01:46:45.832 --> 01:46:46.767
risk behind it --

01:46:46.833 --> 01:46:48.969
So with that program was able to

01:46:49.035 --> 01:46:51.104
create of a and with his

01:46:51.171 --> 01:46:51.738
engineering background is able

01:46:51.805 --> 01:46:54.908
to create a program that really --

01:46:54.975 --> 01:46:57.077
Eliminated Sir bear that would.

01:46:57.144 --> 01:46:57.677
Eliminate the state the race

01:46:57.744 --> 01:46:58.745
that we could possibly take

01:46:58.812 --> 01:47:00.847
place -- So

01:47:00.914 --> 01:47:01.348
with that we have Frank

01:47:01.414 --> 01:47:03.283
advocates that our own making

01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:04.885
our hotline --

01:47:04.951 --> 01:47:05.519
Hours of their bill would be

01:47:05.585 --> 01:47:07.120
Monday to Friday right now

01:47:07.187 --> 01:47:08.889
between eleven AM and five PM --

01:47:08.955 --> 01:47:11.057
They've gone through a forty

01:47:11.124 --> 01:47:11.725
hour domestic violence training

01:47:11.792 --> 01:47:12.692
so they can know the proper

01:47:12.759 --> 01:47:17.330
response for individual that is

01:47:17.397 --> 01:47:18.765
reaching out for help --

01:47:18.832 --> 01:47:20.867
This new innovative strategy and

01:47:20.934 --> 01:47:21.468
we need to our youth who are

01:47:21.535 --> 01:47:22.769
exposed to are victims of dating

01:47:22.836 --> 01:47:25.071
violence bullying or violence in

01:47:25.138 --> 01:47:25.472
their own homes.

01:47:25.539 --> 01:47:27.073
And it reaches them at the point

01:47:27.140 --> 01:47:27.707
of needed their primary source

01:47:27.774 --> 01:47:29.075
of communication which is their

01:47:29.142 --> 01:47:30.744
cell phones and it also fills a

01:47:30.811 --> 01:47:32.813
gap of a service --

01:47:32.879 --> 01:47:34.748
Because we understand that is a

01:47:34.815 --> 01:47:35.348
scary thing three times the I

01:47:35.415 --> 01:47:35.649
need help.

01:47:35.715 --> 01:47:37.083
So there may be a lot of fear or

01:47:37.150 --> 01:47:38.752
anxiety that may exist in which

01:47:38.819 --> 01:47:39.386
prevent them from reaching out

01:47:39.452 --> 01:47:40.854
for help especially calling

01:47:40.921 --> 01:47:42.823
someone a string on the line --

01:47:42.889 --> 01:47:43.490
It's more of a comfort for them

01:47:43.557 --> 01:47:44.925
to be able to text someone are

01:47:44.991 --> 01:47:47.294
and it's all done through a

01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:47.727
desktop system --

01:47:47.794 --> 01:47:52.799
Their numbers coming as

01:47:52.866 --> 01:47:53.400
anonymous numbers at random to

01:47:53.466 --> 01:47:54.835
sign.

01:47:54.901 --> 01:47:57.204
I'm at the Armenian reporter so

01:47:57.270 --> 01:47:58.805
there are certain situations

01:47:58.872 --> 01:48:00.640
where that happens to be broken --

01:48:00.707 --> 01:48:02.943
But they have an understanding

01:48:03.009 --> 01:48:04.878
and then the phone message.

01:48:04.945 --> 01:48:05.378
With our help line --

01:48:05.445 --> 01:48:09.282
We have of the city a little bit

01:48:09.349 --> 01:48:10.717
about it --

01:48:10.784 --> 01:48:12.552
We are seeing on average

01:48:12.619 --> 01:48:14.721
approximately --

01:48:14.788 --> 01:48:15.355
Forty five taxes for a week and

01:48:15.422 --> 01:48:17.157
we slaughter program the second

01:48:17.224 --> 01:48:18.692
week of July --

01:48:18.758 --> 01:48:19.359
With the understanding that this

01:48:19.426 --> 01:48:21.428
is going to be a slow rising --

01:48:21.494 --> 01:48:22.762
Program --

01:48:22.829 --> 01:48:24.865
Reaching out to our youth and

01:48:24.931 --> 01:48:25.398
really encouraging them to

01:48:25.465 --> 01:48:27.234
utilize the program into this

01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:27.767
thing that we spoke about

01:48:27.834 --> 01:48:28.768
earlier.

01:48:28.835 --> 01:48:31.104
On receiving help especially

01:48:31.171 --> 01:48:32.606
with that so --

01:48:32.672 --> 01:48:33.173
It's really been and they

01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:35.242
excited we speak about in the

01:48:35.308 --> 01:48:35.575
classroom --

01:48:35.642 --> 01:48:37.110
Especially with more where's we

01:48:37.177 --> 01:48:39.112
bring them on the teen dating

01:48:39.179 --> 01:48:39.746
violence so they can recognize

01:48:39.813 --> 01:48:41.047
themselves the areas that you do

01:48:41.114 --> 01:48:41.481
need assistance --

01:48:41.548 --> 01:48:44.951
We definitely foresee this

01:48:45.018 --> 01:48:48.788
program be right that service --

01:48:48.855 --> 01:48:50.891
If it's not domestic violence

01:48:50.957 --> 01:48:51.558
specific we absolutely have --

01:48:51.625 --> 01:48:53.126
Strong list of referrals that we

01:48:53.193 --> 01:48:54.928
do -- Send

01:48:54.995 --> 01:48:55.528
them to the fact that they're

01:48:55.595 --> 01:48:56.897
not close --

01:48:56.963 --> 01:48:59.165
To our office to work abroad

01:48:59.232 --> 01:48:59.699

sort we definitely refer out in --

01:49:03.203 --> 01:49:03.637
Are trying to get more

01:49:03.703 --> 01:49:05.238
connections throughout our

01:49:05.305 --> 01:49:06.706
community --

01:49:06.773 --> 01:49:08.742
We service the is the reason of

01:49:08.808 --> 01:49:09.376
Los Angeles all the way through

01:49:09.442 --> 01:49:10.644
the west in the San Benito

01:49:10.710 --> 01:49:10.877
county.

01:49:10.944 --> 01:49:13.013
But we definitely have resources

01:49:13.079 --> 01:49:14.981
outside of that just to meet

01:49:15.048 --> 01:49:17.250
those you that they do come in

01:49:17.317 --> 01:49:20.954

01:49:21.021 --> 01:49:21.254
Thank you.

01:49:21.321 --> 01:49:27.027
Thank you very much.

01:49:27.093 --> 01:49:30.897
Next and last but not least --

01:49:30.964 --> 01:49:38.605
We have our own Devon --

01:49:38.672 --> 01:49:39.239
Panelists I just want to thank

01:49:39.306 --> 01:49:40.941

01:49:41.007 --> 01:49:42.876
and thank you for having that --

01:49:42.943 --> 01:49:44.878
Thank you for the the panelists

01:49:44.945 --> 01:49:45.545
for sharing your story painting

01:49:45.612 --> 01:49:47.013
really complex complex picture.

01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:48.949
Of how domestic violence and

01:49:49.015 --> 01:49:50.817
technology intersect.

01:49:50.884 --> 01:49:53.586
I'm so my name if dozen mailing

01:49:53.653 --> 01:49:55.188
I am YWCA Glendale's prevention

01:49:55.255 --> 01:49:56.856
specialist.

01:49:56.923 --> 01:49:58.858
In our ninety year history we

01:49:58.925 --> 01:49:59.492
have been doing prevention work

01:49:59.559 --> 01:50:02.729
for only two years --

01:50:02.796 --> 01:50:03.330
Our first focuses mostly on

01:50:03.396 --> 01:50:06.633
intervention so what what we DO --

01:50:06.700 --> 01:50:07.200
You know what when violence

01:50:07.267 --> 01:50:09.002
occurs but we really wanted to

01:50:09.069 --> 01:50:11.037
focus on what it wasn't

01:50:11.104 --> 01:50:14.774
happening at all.

01:50:14.841 --> 01:50:17.043
We take a public health approach

01:50:17.110 --> 01:50:18.712
so it's this idea that --

01:50:18.778 --> 01:50:21.114
Think about flu season it's

01:50:21.181 --> 01:50:21.481
simply that --

01:50:21.548 --> 01:50:23.116
What are the little things we

01:50:23.183 --> 01:50:26.653
could do every day to stay well

01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:27.253
like with the fleet right we

01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:29.089
wash our hands we stay away from

01:50:29.155 --> 01:50:30.890
people we are sick?

01:50:30.957 --> 01:50:32.692
Little things to do to stay well

01:50:32.759 --> 01:50:34.961
are a lot easier than the when

01:50:35.028 --> 01:50:39.232
our lives are uprooted when we

01:50:39.299 --> 01:50:41.034
fall.

01:50:41.101 --> 01:50:43.236
This is the approach that we

01:50:43.303 --> 01:50:43.870
take to violence prevention --

01:50:43.937 --> 01:50:45.005
What can we do to stay well as

01:50:45.071 --> 01:50:46.873
an individual and as a community --

01:50:46.940 --> 01:50:49.275
And that's for young people and

01:50:49.342 --> 01:50:50.977
their use of technology plays a

01:50:51.044 --> 01:50:52.812
very vital role.

01:50:52.879 --> 01:50:54.714
These everyday acts of wellness

01:50:54.781 --> 01:50:55.215
that we promote and are

01:50:55.281 --> 01:50:57.050
prevention recognizing warning

01:50:57.117 --> 01:50:57.717
signs the violence learning to

01:50:57.784 --> 01:51:00.820
manage conflict in a healthy way.

01:51:00.887 --> 01:51:01.287
Helping a friend he's

01:51:01.354 --> 01:51:03.023
experiencing violent.

01:51:03.089 --> 01:51:05.091
Learning boundaries consent.

01:51:05.158 --> 01:51:06.993
These are all acts that can only

01:51:07.060 --> 01:51:08.962
be learned by teens but these

01:51:09.029 --> 01:51:11.297
messages these behaviors these

01:51:11.364 --> 01:51:12.832
skills.

01:51:12.899 --> 01:51:13.433
Can be spread and promoted by

01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:14.667
them.

01:51:14.734 --> 01:51:16.970
You have bill extremely vast and

01:51:17.037 --> 01:51:17.604
dense social networks all over

01:51:17.670 --> 01:51:18.972
the world.

01:51:19.039 --> 01:51:21.107
The team I work with tell me

01:51:21.174 --> 01:51:21.708
about their best friends in

01:51:21.775 --> 01:51:24.911
Texas El Salvador Thailand's

01:51:24.978 --> 01:51:25.145
thing.

01:51:25.211 --> 01:51:27.080
They tell me how their tweets

01:51:27.147 --> 01:51:29.015
have been retweeted by hundreds

01:51:29.082 --> 01:51:30.950
of other teens.

01:51:31.017 --> 01:51:32.986
How a celebrity might have re

01:51:33.053 --> 01:51:36.823
tweeted them --

01:51:36.890 --> 01:51:37.390
Team have a powerful voice.

01:51:37.457 --> 01:51:39.159
They have a great deal of

01:51:39.225 --> 01:51:40.827
influence among their peers in

01:51:40.894 --> 01:51:42.796
in their community.

01:51:42.862 --> 01:51:44.964
So part of our prevention where.

01:51:45.031 --> 01:51:46.699
It's not only exploring issues

01:51:46.766 --> 01:51:47.367
of teen dating violence but how

01:51:47.434 --> 01:51:49.335
do we harness that leadership

01:51:49.402 --> 01:51:50.804
how do we help you find their

01:51:50.870 --> 01:51:51.037
voice.

01:51:51.104 --> 01:51:53.239
And use it in a way that

01:51:53.306 --> 01:51:54.641
promotes healthy communities.

01:51:54.707 --> 01:51:57.243
So for our YWCA Glendale our

01:51:57.310 --> 01:52:00.814
work started with conversations

01:52:00.880 --> 01:52:01.281
and a lot of them --

01:52:01.347 --> 01:52:02.682
We went into classrooms we

01:52:02.749 --> 01:52:05.018
hosted training for class credit --

01:52:05.085 --> 01:52:07.487
We spoke to club immobilized

01:52:07.554 --> 01:52:09.255
wallets this on issues that

01:52:09.322 --> 01:52:11.091
affect them in their school

01:52:11.157 --> 01:52:12.859
sexual harassment dating

01:52:12.926 --> 01:52:13.426
violence sexual assault and

01:52:13.493 --> 01:52:14.828
racism.

01:52:14.894 --> 01:52:17.263
Discuss how to interrupt these

01:52:17.330 --> 01:52:17.664
acts of violence.

01:52:17.730 --> 01:52:19.032
We talked about how social media

01:52:19.099 --> 01:52:20.967
can be a very powerful tool and

01:52:21.034 --> 01:52:23.136
spreading his ideas we were

01:52:23.203 --> 01:52:24.971
talking about.

01:52:25.038 --> 01:52:25.572
And to call out violence when

01:52:25.638 --> 01:52:27.040
you see it.

01:52:27.107 --> 01:52:29.375
After we had this conversation.

01:52:29.442 --> 01:52:31.444
What we notice is students

01:52:31.511 --> 01:52:33.012
wanted to talk more students

01:52:33.079 --> 01:52:34.881
wanted to get more involved --

01:52:34.948 --> 01:52:37.050
I had a group of students walk

01:52:37.117 --> 01:52:38.785
from school one day to my office.

01:52:38.852 --> 01:52:39.419
To talk about a friend who is

01:52:39.486 --> 01:52:43.022
experiencing domestic violence

01:52:43.089 --> 01:52:44.557
and what they could do --

01:52:44.624 --> 01:52:46.960
I had student to state our long

01:52:47.026 --> 01:52:48.962
after presentation was over to

01:52:49.028 --> 01:52:49.629
talk about issues of sent that

01:52:49.696 --> 01:52:50.930
they were too embarrassed to

01:52:50.997 --> 01:52:53.199
talk. To talk about an for their

01:52:53.266 --> 01:52:55.101
classmates.

01:52:55.168 --> 01:52:56.970
I've had students request --

01:52:57.036 --> 01:52:58.872
Other conditions with peers I

01:52:58.938 --> 01:53:00.707
had students request

01:53:00.773 --> 01:53:03.042
presentations for their parents.

01:53:03.109 --> 01:53:05.111
Until it students it's not

01:53:05.178 --> 01:53:06.980
teachers it's on adult it's you.

01:53:07.046 --> 01:53:09.115
Who want to have this

01:53:09.182 --> 01:53:10.817
conversation is you to want to

01:53:10.884 --> 01:53:12.986
do something --

01:53:13.052 --> 01:53:14.821
Young people are often tool that

01:53:14.888 --> 01:53:16.923
they can not enact real social

01:53:16.990 --> 01:53:18.892
with little change --

01:53:18.958 --> 01:53:19.526
They're told that they're too

01:53:19.592 --> 01:53:23.096
young too inexperienced to naive

01:53:23.163 --> 01:53:24.831
or two idealistic.

01:53:24.898 --> 01:53:25.498
But if you have shown us time

01:53:25.565 --> 01:53:27.200
and time again we heard several

01:53:27.267 --> 01:53:27.467
examples.

01:53:27.534 --> 01:53:30.803
The young people hold Y. ten

01:53:30.870 --> 01:53:31.471
jewel in the realm of activism

01:53:31.538 --> 01:53:32.805
and social justice work.

01:53:32.872 --> 01:53:33.373
And they can realize that

01:53:33.439 --> 01:53:35.108
potential through the use of

01:53:35.175 --> 01:53:35.408
technology.

01:53:35.475 --> 01:53:38.912
I'll give a call.

01:53:38.978 --> 01:53:41.181
And that is the question.

01:53:41.247 --> 01:53:42.782
She asked me to speak at a walk

01:53:42.849 --> 01:53:44.717
out she organized after school.

01:53:44.784 --> 01:53:45.185
Protesting the school

01:53:45.251 --> 01:53:46.986
administrations response to

01:53:47.053 --> 01:53:48.755
complaints of sexual harassment

01:53:48.821 --> 01:53:50.823
made against another student.

01:53:50.890 --> 01:53:54.727
She had made a YouTube video.

01:53:54.794 --> 01:53:55.261
YouTube video went viral.

01:53:55.328 --> 01:53:56.663
Spread around --

01:53:56.729 --> 01:53:58.765
Schools in New York Texas in

01:53:58.831 --> 01:54:01.201
Massachusetts all organized walk

01:54:01.267 --> 01:54:04.938
out in solidarity with her --

01:54:05.004 --> 01:54:07.006
I had the opportunity to talk to

01:54:07.073 --> 01:54:08.708
students that they about consent

01:54:08.775 --> 01:54:09.409
ways and we brainstorm ways that

01:54:09.475 --> 01:54:10.977
they continue the conversation.

01:54:11.044 --> 01:54:13.046
Just Monday I got a call from a

01:54:13.112 --> 01:54:15.081
from a teacher at that school.

01:54:15.148 --> 01:54:16.883
Who wanted to know how to talk

01:54:16.950 --> 01:54:17.383
about consent with their

01:54:17.450 --> 01:54:20.720
students --

01:54:20.787 --> 01:54:21.387
The reach that hurt it had it

01:54:21.454 --> 01:54:23.122
would not have been possible

01:54:23.189 --> 01:54:25.058
without technology --

01:54:25.124 --> 01:54:28.895
To an adolescent development the

01:54:28.962 --> 01:54:29.429
power the peers extremely

01:54:29.495 --> 01:54:29.729
important.

01:54:29.796 --> 01:54:30.830
Teams are seeking connection

01:54:30.897 --> 01:54:32.865
teams are seeking acceptance.

01:54:32.932 --> 01:54:34.968
And approval.

01:54:35.034 --> 01:54:37.136
And so for me is a great way to

01:54:37.203 --> 01:54:38.771
meet those needs.

01:54:38.838 --> 01:54:40.940
Social media communication helps

01:54:41.007 --> 01:54:44.844
you develop better social skills

01:54:44.911 --> 01:54:45.144
[inaudible]

01:54:45.211 --> 01:54:45.511
Feel isolated.

01:54:45.578 --> 01:54:46.846
Learn about new ideas new

01:54:46.913 --> 01:54:49.048
culture.

01:54:49.115 --> 01:54:49.582
Bond with their friends.

01:54:49.649 --> 01:54:52.819
Express themselves.

01:54:52.885 --> 01:54:54.721
And get support.

01:54:54.787 --> 01:54:56.756
So why not encourage you to use

01:54:56.823 --> 01:54:57.223
that to create healthy

01:54:57.290 --> 01:55:00.727
communities.

01:55:00.793 --> 01:55:01.261
We know what we see in a

01:55:01.327 --> 01:55:03.129
classroom with told to us.

01:55:03.196 --> 01:55:05.098
But as assembly member Rubio

01:55:05.164 --> 01:55:07.300
mention like we're not that next

01:55:07.367 --> 01:55:08.735
to it.

01:55:08.801 --> 01:55:10.870
Right we're not in group chat

01:55:10.937 --> 01:55:12.872
we're not in hot boys were not

01:55:12.939 --> 01:55:13.373
in their social media.

01:55:13.439 --> 01:55:15.108
You are connected to their

01:55:15.174 --> 01:55:17.010
communities you are connected to

01:55:17.076 --> 01:55:18.945
other you.

01:55:19.012 --> 01:55:19.512
In a way that we cannot be.

01:55:19.579 --> 01:55:21.080
So when young people are then

01:55:21.147 --> 01:55:22.949
given the skills and tools

01:55:23.016 --> 01:55:24.951
through prevention education to

01:55:25.018 --> 01:55:26.986
follow her own voice to create

01:55:27.053 --> 01:55:28.655
their own messages.

01:55:28.721 --> 01:55:30.957
Dobson we can change communities.

01:55:31.024 --> 01:55:34.627
The young people have the power

01:55:34.694 --> 01:55:36.729
to make our community well. To

01:55:36.796 --> 01:55:38.698
prevent harm from ever happening.

01:55:38.765 --> 01:55:40.800
Domestic violence service

01:55:40.867 --> 01:55:42.702
providers and advocates.

01:55:42.769 --> 01:55:45.338
Policy advocates policy makers.

01:55:45.405 --> 01:55:46.973
Continue to focus on the power

01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:50.677
of youth in prevention education

01:55:50.743 --> 01:55:52.845
we can see things occur

01:55:52.912 --> 01:55:53.146
[inaudible]

01:55:53.212 --> 01:55:59.185
Thank you.

01:55:59.252 --> 01:56:01.087
Will you very much --

01:56:01.154 --> 01:56:01.721
At this time I would like to

01:56:01.788 --> 01:56:03.156
open it up to a public comment

01:56:03.222 --> 01:56:05.058
on if you want to step up to the

01:56:05.124 --> 01:56:07.093
podium if you have any comments.

01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:08.661
Or if you have questions will be

01:56:08.728 --> 01:56:09.128
around and we have the

01:56:09.195 --> 01:56:12.632
information of all of our pan.

01:56:12.699 --> 01:56:14.934
Mason but if there's anybody

01:56:15.001 --> 01:56:15.301
interested in --

01:56:15.368 --> 01:56:16.936
Making a comment.

01:56:17.003 --> 01:56:18.638
You can come up.

01:56:18.705 --> 01:56:26.846
Thank you very much.

01:56:26.913 --> 01:56:29.082
I just wanted.

01:56:29.148 --> 01:56:31.017
To make a profit and I just

01:56:31.084 --> 01:56:32.885
wanted to quickly.

01:56:32.952 --> 01:56:34.821
Address just a few things --

01:56:34.887 --> 01:56:36.823
Thank you.

01:56:36.889 --> 01:56:37.490
I don't think it's about adding

01:56:37.557 --> 01:56:38.825
additional resources in fact

01:56:38.891 --> 01:56:41.260
when we went through an economic

01:56:41.327 --> 01:56:42.695
downturn.

01:56:42.762 --> 01:56:44.831
I was invigorated on how we

01:56:44.897 --> 01:56:45.398
could change the way we do

01:56:45.465 --> 01:56:47.233
business right I think that's

01:56:47.300 --> 01:56:48.735
the most important thing --

01:56:48.801 --> 01:56:50.770
We have the California office of

01:56:50.837 --> 01:56:51.270
emergency services law

01:56:51.337 --> 01:56:52.672
enforcement specialized units

01:56:52.739 --> 01:56:55.141
grant we have several domestic

01:56:55.208 --> 01:56:55.742
brown's grants that are out

01:56:55.808 --> 01:56:55.975
there.

01:56:56.042 --> 01:56:57.210
It really is about changing how

01:56:57.276 --> 01:56:59.078
we use our resources and if we

01:56:59.145 --> 01:57:01.214
had priority areas within their

01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:03.116
in terms of technology abuse and

01:57:03.182 --> 01:57:05.385
there are some in there already.

01:57:05.451 --> 01:57:06.786
But we strengthen the language I

01:57:06.853 --> 01:57:08.921
think that we can become more

01:57:08.988 --> 01:57:10.957
effective across the state in

01:57:11.023 --> 01:57:12.759
terms of how we use those monies --

01:57:12.825 --> 01:57:15.128
And more with thought and I love

01:57:15.194 --> 01:57:16.596
law enforcement specials units

01:57:16.662 --> 01:57:17.196
grant specifically because of

01:57:17.263 --> 01:57:17.597
Fong course me.

01:57:17.663 --> 01:57:19.332
And advocacy they're required to

01:57:19.399 --> 01:57:20.666
work together advocate is

01:57:20.733 --> 01:57:22.902
required to come into the police

01:57:22.969 --> 01:57:25.004
department which I think is.

01:57:25.071 --> 01:57:30.843
Phenomenal is been great for us --

01:57:30.910 --> 01:57:31.344
We were able to use the

01:57:31.411 --> 01:57:33.312
California office of research

01:57:33.379 --> 01:57:35.047
grants. To teach our

01:57:35.114 --> 01:57:36.916
investigators to do things

01:57:36.983 --> 01:57:37.550
differently so no matter if we

01:57:37.617 --> 01:57:39.085
lost the money or not.

01:57:39.152 --> 01:57:39.585
They were just taught a

01:57:39.652 --> 01:57:40.987
different skill sets we

01:57:41.053 --> 01:57:43.222
developed an internal program so

01:57:43.289 --> 01:57:45.057
it didn't matter if anybody gave

01:57:45.124 --> 01:57:46.826
us me because we can do it

01:57:46.893 --> 01:57:47.126
ourselves.

01:57:47.193 --> 01:57:48.861
So I think that's an opportunity

01:57:48.928 --> 01:57:49.495
that also I would just like to

01:57:49.562 --> 01:57:50.897
address --

01:57:50.963 --> 01:57:52.965
Some of it the stuff that came

01:57:53.032 --> 01:57:53.266
up earlier.

01:57:53.332 --> 01:57:55.001
Absolutely evicting should not

01:57:55.067 --> 01:57:56.936
have to wait thirty days to

01:57:57.003 --> 01:57:57.637
going to their house if you have

01:57:57.703 --> 01:57:59.071
an emergency protective order

01:57:59.138 --> 01:58:01.007
you can go into your house.

01:58:01.073 --> 01:58:02.809
And you can obtain some of the

01:58:02.875 --> 01:58:04.777
items that you need they're not

01:58:04.844 --> 01:58:05.445
going to divide up all of your

01:58:05.511 --> 01:58:07.113
property but you can't get

01:58:07.180 --> 01:58:08.948
yourself as you can get certain

01:58:09.015 --> 01:58:09.348
items etcetera.

01:58:09.415 --> 01:58:11.083
The judge can actually lists

01:58:11.150 --> 01:58:12.819
certain items of property on

01:58:12.885 --> 01:58:14.954
emergency protective order --

01:58:15.021 --> 01:58:16.689
On your temporary would not if

01:58:16.756 --> 01:58:18.691
you'll excuse me minor temporary

01:58:18.758 --> 01:58:19.358
restraining order that's great.

01:58:19.425 --> 01:58:21.194
So I do want to let you guys

01:58:21.260 --> 01:58:21.828
know that that is out there and

01:58:21.894 --> 01:58:22.728
available.

01:58:22.795 --> 01:58:26.766
Absolutely if you can't on this

01:58:26.833 --> 01:58:27.400

Twenty one the right direction --

01:58:33.206 --> 01:58:42.748
And then also I think before

01:58:42.815 --> 01:58:45.017

01:58:53.226 --> 01:58:53.626
in the fifties okay.

01:58:53.693 --> 01:58:55.328
Under two guys to show up a gun

01:58:55.394 --> 01:58:57.296
fight one guy lost okay but we

01:58:57.363 --> 01:58:59.265

victims are spousal in a partner

01:59:05.204 --> 01:59:08.975
victims understand what that is --

01:59:09.041 --> 01:59:11.110
And we're there to help.

01:59:11.177 --> 01:59:12.979
Yeah but we really are and we

01:59:13.045 --> 01:59:15.214

You know how do I speak the

01:59:23.489 --> 01:59:23.689

Thank you very much and and you

01:59:30.863 --> 01:59:33.065
are correct and I think that's

01:59:33.132 --> 01:59:35.301
why are these that hearings have

01:59:35.368 --> 01:59:37.069
been so productive in my opinion

01:59:37.136 --> 01:59:38.971
because I myself didn't know.

01:59:39.038 --> 01:59:40.973
A lot of the resources that were

01:59:41.040 --> 01:59:41.574
available and if I you know

01:59:41.641 --> 01:59:47.013
consider myself --

01:59:47.079 --> 01:59:47.613
Advocate for so many different

01:59:47.680 --> 01:59:49.015
things and I have no idea about

01:59:49.081 --> 01:59:49.649
these resources I think that's

01:59:49.715 --> 01:59:51.050
why it's so important for all of

01:59:51.117 --> 01:59:51.551

01:59:51.617 --> 01:59:52.652
So that we can start spreading

01:59:52.718 --> 01:59:54.887
the information and I we've

01:59:54.954 --> 01:59:56.923
committed to putting all the

01:59:56.989 --> 01:59:58.824
resources on our website.

01:59:58.891 --> 02:00:00.826

02:00:00.893 --> 02:00:02.795

02:00:02.862 --> 02:00:05.131

02:00:09.101 --> 02:00:09.569
be and then our belief.

02:00:09.635 --> 02:00:11.370
Might my colleagues to make sure

02:00:11.437 --> 02:00:14.840

02:01:35.187 --> 02:01:36.956
That's how bad a Latino

02:01:37.023 --> 02:01:39.191
community agencies out there

02:01:39.258 --> 02:01:42.828
providing this kind of a

02:01:42.895 --> 02:01:44.864
important information.

A lot of the information we need

02:01:59.412 --> 02:02:00.880

02:02:03.416 --> 02:02:04.784
So -- My

02:02:04.850 --> 02:02:06.752
proposal to you assembly woman

02:02:06.819 --> 02:02:09.121

02:02:09.188 --> 02:02:10.790

definitely going to work

02:02:28.974 --> 02:02:29.475
together glasses [inaudible]

02:02:29.542 --> 02:02:34.914
Thank you.

02:02:34.980 --> 02:02:36.682
Thank you it's an honor to be

02:02:36.749 --> 02:02:38.684
here amount until young older

02:02:38.751 --> 02:02:41.087
several of us here are CEO devil

02:02:41.153 --> 02:02:42.755
if Cristina Locle and myself and

02:02:42.822 --> 02:02:44.890
we we are honored because I

02:02:44.957 --> 02:02:45.558
think it's quite often minimized.

02:02:45.624 --> 02:02:48.828
And it's such an important topic

02:02:48.894 --> 02:02:49.462
and and did all you know you.

02:02:49.528 --> 02:02:51.063
Have to know what we were gonna

02:02:51.130 --> 02:02:51.597
say training is crucial.

02:02:51.664 --> 02:02:54.967
We I think most of us as service

02:02:55.034 --> 02:02:56.702
providers in the DVD feel we

02:02:56.769 --> 02:02:58.738
partner with law enforcement but

02:02:58.804 --> 02:03:03.008
we need to really strengthen our

02:03:03.075 --> 02:03:06.812
relationship so we listening.

02:03:06.879 --> 02:03:09.115
To the conversation for the past

02:03:09.181 --> 02:03:10.683
two and a half hours I even a

02:03:10.750 --> 02:03:13.018
life sometimes we minimize back

02:03:13.085 --> 02:03:14.687
because you know.

02:03:14.754 --> 02:03:17.022
Technology up or is a form of

02:03:17.089 --> 02:03:19.125
should be protection and not a

02:03:19.191 --> 02:03:19.525
product and all.

02:03:19.592 --> 02:03:20.960
And that's something that is

02:03:21.026 --> 02:03:23.329
very prevalent in the DVD feel.

02:03:23.395 --> 02:03:25.097
So I think with training and way

02:03:25.164 --> 02:03:25.431
the just --

02:03:25.498 --> 02:03:27.299
Reaching out to each other and

02:03:27.366 --> 02:03:28.701
also.

02:03:28.768 --> 02:03:30.770
Looking out what other service

02:03:30.836 --> 02:03:31.470
providers are doing is also that

02:03:31.537 --> 02:03:35.007
a trained in the field in terms

02:03:35.074 --> 02:03:37.076
of how to reach the the the

02:03:37.143 --> 02:03:37.676
teens because for me that was

02:03:37.743 --> 02:03:38.911
such a popular thing to know

02:03:38.978 --> 02:03:41.180
that yes it is a form of protect.

02:03:41.247 --> 02:03:44.884
Of of control but it's also a

02:03:44.950 --> 02:03:46.986
way to empower and become a

02:03:47.052 --> 02:03:47.520
survivor a TT that may be

02:03:47.586 --> 02:03:48.821
experiencing that.

02:03:48.888 --> 02:03:51.023
Doesn't have to be harmful it

02:03:51.090 --> 02:03:51.724
could be on the country could be

02:03:51.791 --> 02:03:53.025
something that could help.

02:03:53.092 --> 02:03:55.227
So it is I look forward to these

02:03:55.294 --> 02:03:58.764
conversations but to see what

02:03:58.831 --> 02:04:05.037
the legislation will also.

02:04:05.104 --> 02:04:05.437
Inform [inaudible]

02:04:05.504 --> 02:04:08.941
Thank you.

02:04:09.008 --> 02:04:09.408
Hello I think these.

02:04:09.475 --> 02:04:10.810
Conversations are very important

02:04:10.876 --> 02:04:11.377
but I work in a domestic

02:04:11.443 --> 02:04:12.778
violence shelter and we just

02:04:12.845 --> 02:04:14.980
recently implemented a policy on

02:04:15.047 --> 02:04:18.751
helping to get them to maintain

02:04:18.818 --> 02:04:20.986
their cell phones and filter --

02:04:21.053 --> 02:04:21.654
Many shelters do not allow that.

02:04:21.720 --> 02:04:25.157
But it is easy. To service to

02:04:25.224 --> 02:04:26.659
our clients to take their phone

02:04:26.725 --> 02:04:28.894
so it was a lengthy conversation

02:04:28.961 --> 02:04:31.130
and many of our staff are not

02:04:31.197 --> 02:04:32.798
trained in technology.

02:04:32.865 --> 02:04:36.969
So it is something that we do.

02:04:37.036 --> 02:04:39.305
To help us and give us.

02:04:39.371 --> 02:04:42.975
Advice and suggestions on how.

02:04:43.042 --> 02:04:46.912
To inform them of safe ways to

02:04:46.979 --> 02:04:47.546
keep their phones and use them

02:04:47.613 --> 02:04:49.048
safely and we did that as a

02:04:49.114 --> 02:04:55.087
staff but we would. Eight more

02:04:55.154 --> 02:04:55.754
involvement from the technology

02:04:55.821 --> 02:04:58.891
companies because taking the

02:04:58.958 --> 02:05:00.993
phones from the done does not

02:05:01.060 --> 02:05:03.195
help them it hurts found.

02:05:03.262 --> 02:05:04.830
And we need to help them to have

02:05:04.897 --> 02:05:07.266
all the resources and maintain

02:05:07.333 --> 02:05:08.834
their contacts with people who

02:05:08.901 --> 02:05:10.736
are supported to them.

02:05:10.803 --> 02:05:14.907
And their allies support system.

02:05:14.974 --> 02:05:16.842
Thank you thank you and and onto

02:05:16.909 --> 02:05:18.911
the comic I I agree I think --

02:05:18.978 --> 02:05:21.280
But the lives of the victims are

02:05:21.347 --> 02:05:21.914
already up and about the days

02:05:21.981 --> 02:05:22.781
and then to take something so

02:05:22.848 --> 02:05:23.449
are we live with our phones I

02:05:23.515 --> 02:05:26.652
mean it's not a secret anymore.

02:05:26.719 --> 02:05:30.689
And to to lose something else --

02:05:30.756 --> 02:05:33.125
I think is is a of what's

02:05:33.192 --> 02:05:34.660
happening when you take away

02:05:34.727 --> 02:05:35.227
that the technology that we

02:05:35.294 --> 02:05:36.829
depend on every day and so

02:05:36.896 --> 02:05:39.098
that's just another loss of and

02:05:39.164 --> 02:05:40.866
basically.

02:05:40.933 --> 02:05:43.168
Odd looking at them as a second

02:05:43.235 --> 02:05:44.670
class citizens because now they

02:05:44.737 --> 02:05:46.939
don't have access to electronic --

02:05:47.006 --> 02:05:47.573
So thank you for doing that and

02:05:47.640 --> 02:05:48.841
you know I think --

02:05:48.908 --> 02:05:50.943
We have much to talk about and

02:05:51.010 --> 02:05:53.012
hopefully we can all and try to

02:05:53.078 --> 02:05:55.014
figure out --

02:05:55.080 --> 02:05:56.849
What we do now after the

02:05:56.916 --> 02:05:59.018
conversations and I've said it

02:05:59.084 --> 02:06:00.753
many times in our our previous --

02:06:00.819 --> 02:06:01.253
Hearing that I love the

02:06:01.320 --> 02:06:05.090
conversations by.

02:06:05.157 --> 02:06:05.791
We're just having a conversation

02:06:05.858 --> 02:06:06.959
and basically wasting our day

02:06:07.026 --> 02:06:09.495
and of my commitment and the

02:06:09.561 --> 02:06:09.895
commitment from.

02:06:09.962 --> 02:06:10.829
From -- Our

02:06:10.896 --> 02:06:12.965
partners is that it won't be a

02:06:13.032 --> 02:06:14.633
waste of time this is actually a

02:06:14.700 --> 02:06:19.138
conversation to begin action

02:06:19.204 --> 02:06:23.008
something.

02:06:23.075 --> 02:06:27.112
Hello my name is Amanda at the

02:06:27.179 --> 02:06:27.446
hidden from.

02:06:27.513 --> 02:06:30.716
I guess I had a few questions --

02:06:30.783 --> 02:06:32.985
We are looking for immediate

02:06:33.052 --> 02:06:33.552
action and thank you all for

02:06:33.619 --> 02:06:36.822
everybody information on I

02:06:36.889 --> 02:06:37.423
wanted to know at the family

02:06:37.489 --> 02:06:40.893
courts like Stanley Mosk armed

02:06:40.960 --> 02:06:42.661
the talking parents that's the I

02:06:42.728 --> 02:06:44.763
ordered.

02:06:44.830 --> 02:06:45.331
Between the parent and the

02:06:45.397 --> 02:06:46.999
father and the mother the

02:06:47.066 --> 02:06:48.901
children while the border these

02:06:48.968 --> 02:06:49.168
battles.

02:06:49.234 --> 02:06:51.003
Is there any kind of catch net

02:06:51.070 --> 02:06:51.637
to catch domestic violence at

02:06:51.704 --> 02:06:54.940
that level because that's

02:06:55.007 --> 02:06:55.541
happening now and not as with

02:06:55.607 --> 02:06:56.709
current.

02:06:56.775 --> 02:06:59.278
And I found somebody who got the

02:06:59.345 --> 02:07:00.713
night.

02:07:00.779 --> 02:07:01.280
Domestic violence protection

02:07:01.347 --> 02:07:02.881
records.

02:07:02.948 --> 02:07:05.184
And I represent myself poker

02:07:05.250 --> 02:07:05.517
into a woman.

02:07:05.584 --> 02:07:07.052
Might have been wasted fifteen

02:07:07.119 --> 02:07:10.789
thousand dollars in a group home.

02:07:10.856 --> 02:07:12.825
But then.

02:07:12.891 --> 02:07:14.960
I'm going to another situation

02:07:15.027 --> 02:07:16.962
idea to go here but I need help

02:07:17.029 --> 02:07:17.329
because I was.

02:07:17.396 --> 02:07:20.766
A child office in god back in

02:07:20.833 --> 02:07:21.400
twenty fifteen help me with the

02:07:21.467 --> 02:07:22.868
same abuse but never got

02:07:22.935 --> 02:07:23.135
resolved.

02:07:23.202 --> 02:07:24.803
And now it's affected my

02:07:24.870 --> 02:07:26.805
children my children behind --

02:07:26.872 --> 02:07:30.776
There was a couple.

02:07:30.843 --> 02:07:33.078
Able to the move.

02:07:33.145 --> 02:07:34.880
Meyer restraining orders to be

02:07:34.947 --> 02:07:38.984
served even though --

02:07:39.051 --> 02:07:44.923
To off reports I was denied

02:07:44.990 --> 02:07:47.059
represented myself into the

02:07:47.126 --> 02:07:48.894
court and it's bad it's it's my

02:07:48.961 --> 02:07:50.996
ex husband has the pool. To mess

02:07:51.063 --> 02:07:52.698
with me -- I

02:07:52.765 --> 02:07:54.800
refer you this unified school

02:07:54.867 --> 02:07:55.401
district I had three jobs for

02:07:55.467 --> 02:07:57.403
them I'm a one on one for

02:07:57.469 --> 02:07:58.904
special ed and I was also

02:07:58.971 --> 02:08:00.873
behavioral counselor locked down

02:08:00.939 --> 02:08:02.808
so I am a service.

02:08:02.875 --> 02:08:03.509
And I work at four different law

02:08:03.575 --> 02:08:04.043
firms there is something

02:08:04.109 --> 02:08:05.077
seriously going wrong.

02:08:05.144 --> 02:08:07.413
And we need to address it like

02:08:07.479 --> 02:08:07.746
immediately.

02:08:07.813 --> 02:08:09.148
There should be some kind of

02:08:09.214 --> 02:08:12.718
caps that at all of these.

02:08:12.785 --> 02:08:15.254
Spots where kids could be harmed

02:08:15.320 --> 02:08:18.791
and it's just not their the

02:08:18.857 --> 02:08:21.026
advocates lawyers.

02:08:21.093 --> 02:08:21.593
American Bar such I used to

02:08:21.660 --> 02:08:22.761
respect the law.

02:08:22.828 --> 02:08:24.997
Now I am just quite surprised

02:08:25.064 --> 02:08:26.698
that is not in the chicken pox --

02:08:26.765 --> 02:08:31.070
I would like on to talk to many

02:08:31.136 --> 02:08:31.737
people I will try to address by

02:08:31.804 --> 02:08:34.940
email on my specifically but a

02:08:35.007 --> 02:08:36.975
child's office help recruit like

02:08:37.042 --> 02:08:40.946
within three days --

02:08:41.013 --> 02:08:42.815
I belong to the house of group --

02:08:42.881 --> 02:08:45.484
I won at the state level level

02:08:45.551 --> 02:08:47.086
and appeals against the county

02:08:47.152 --> 02:08:50.756
of for we believe the nine

02:08:50.823 --> 02:08:53.025
rights at house of room where I

02:08:53.092 --> 02:08:54.660
was that --

02:08:54.726 --> 02:08:57.262
Still might be easier was able

02:08:57.329 --> 02:08:57.496
to do.

02:08:57.563 --> 02:08:59.431
Everything to the point where my

02:08:59.498 --> 02:09:04.703
daughters are now ordered to him.

02:09:04.770 --> 02:09:05.037
Our views --

02:09:05.104 --> 02:09:06.872
So and that's happening right

02:09:06.939 --> 02:09:07.072
now.

02:09:07.139 --> 02:09:08.907
And that's after one sounding

02:09:08.974 --> 02:09:12.811
más.

02:09:12.878 --> 02:09:14.980
And my children have been denied

02:09:15.047 --> 02:09:16.982
access to three months now which

02:09:17.049 --> 02:09:17.549
sets them up a borderline

02:09:17.616 --> 02:09:18.717
personality disorder.

02:09:18.784 --> 02:09:20.886
So -- I

02:09:20.953 --> 02:09:23.155
would like to know my resources

02:09:23.222 --> 02:09:25.023
and then we want to get to know

02:09:25.090 --> 02:09:25.491
making also great --

02:09:25.557 --> 02:09:28.760
But yes I agree that we should.

02:09:28.827 --> 02:09:30.896
Have a lot of great ideas at

02:09:30.963 --> 02:09:34.933
every level.

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:35.501
Especially with a beautiful

02:09:35.567 --> 02:09:37.102
system.

02:09:37.169 --> 02:09:37.769
Thank you for and again just to

02:09:37.836 --> 02:09:38.737
address --

02:09:38.804 --> 02:09:39.338
Some of your your concerns we

02:09:39.404 --> 02:09:41.140
have the same concerns --

02:09:41.206 --> 02:09:43.075

02:09:43.142 --> 02:09:45.410
constituents is on aye Estevez

02:09:50.883 --> 02:09:52.951
Remember that was about the

02:09:53.018 --> 02:09:53.452

when her child disappeared the

02:10:01.093 --> 02:10:03.195
courts gave her ex husband --

02:10:03.262 --> 02:10:06.932
Access to the child and after

02:10:06.999 --> 02:10:08.834

02:10:39.364 --> 02:10:40.999
work with her because she had a

02:10:41.066 --> 02:10:42.734
lot of complaints about the

02:10:42.801 --> 02:10:43.302
court system by judges the

02:10:43.368 --> 02:10:44.970

Right just wanted knowledge your

02:11:47.399 --> 02:11:49.268
story and thank you for sharing

02:11:49.334 --> 02:11:51.203
it with all of us in the room

02:11:51.270 --> 02:11:52.971

02:11:53.038 --> 02:11:53.505
Credible important for the

02:11:53.572 --> 02:11:55.274
voices of ours we heard the

02:11:55.340 --> 02:11:56.975
thank you.

02:11:57.042 --> 02:11:58.810

02:11:58.877 --> 02:11:59.278
Do you for listening.

02:11:59.344 --> 02:12:01.346
I wanted to address a couple of

02:12:01.413 --> 02:12:03.048
previous comments that came up

02:12:03.115 --> 02:12:05.183
the previous commenter talk

02:12:05.250 --> 02:12:05.784
about cell phones being taken

02:12:05.851 --> 02:12:10.922
away we partner with them it

02:12:10.989 --> 02:12:11.590
thinking that project as well so

02:12:11.657 --> 02:12:14.926
I wanted to put in a plug --

02:12:14.993 --> 02:12:15.427
For those trainings --

02:12:15.494 --> 02:12:16.962
We see similar things happening

02:12:17.029 --> 02:12:18.664
across the country and

02:12:18.730 --> 02:12:19.231
unfortunately it's the same

02:12:19.298 --> 02:12:21.033
pattern that.

02:12:21.099 --> 02:12:22.834
You know of users use is taking

02:12:22.901 --> 02:12:24.970
away devices and controlling so

02:12:25.037 --> 02:12:26.838
so wanting to really get into

02:12:26.905 --> 02:12:28.974
organizations and assist with

02:12:29.041 --> 02:12:29.574
that and I just wanna put it

02:12:29.641 --> 02:12:30.676
applied --

02:12:30.742 --> 02:12:33.045
For some resources we have it

02:12:33.111 --> 02:12:34.946
takes a few dot org --

02:12:35.013 --> 02:12:35.614
There's a legal systems tool kit

02:12:35.681 --> 02:12:37.015
that's available for law

02:12:37.082 --> 02:12:39.217
enforcement and court personnel --

02:12:39.284 --> 02:12:40.952
And also an agency you still

02:12:41.019 --> 02:12:43.155
care for local programs and then --

02:12:43.221 --> 02:12:44.790
Survivor tool kit --

02:12:44.856 --> 02:12:45.123
For victims.

02:12:45.190 --> 02:12:49.094
Who are looking for a split

02:12:49.161 --> 02:12:50.862
around technology safety

02:12:50.929 --> 02:12:51.163
[inaudible]

02:12:51.229 --> 02:12:54.766
Thank you.

02:12:54.833 --> 02:12:57.035
Hi how are you thank you so much

02:12:57.102 --> 02:12:58.837
of an honor to be here money

02:12:58.904 --> 02:13:00.972
said yes now if I'm with with

02:13:01.039 --> 02:13:01.640
the ball park police department

02:13:01.707 --> 02:13:03.141
and I'm actually that the method

02:13:03.208 --> 02:13:03.642
by the topic at that.

02:13:03.709 --> 02:13:05.010
I've been with them for ten

02:13:05.077 --> 02:13:05.243
years.

02:13:05.310 --> 02:13:07.245
So I know how important this is

02:13:07.312 --> 02:13:08.914
for everyone. For as for me I

02:13:08.980 --> 02:13:11.083
actually was a victim of

02:13:11.149 --> 02:13:12.651
domestic violence from the age

02:13:12.718 --> 02:13:14.786
of fourteen always reach like.

02:13:14.853 --> 02:13:15.320
Twenty four so I know how

02:13:15.387 --> 02:13:16.922
important it is by no one

02:13:16.988 --> 02:13:19.191
reasons why you say there are no

02:13:19.257 --> 02:13:21.059
other reason.

02:13:21.126 --> 02:13:21.293
That --

02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:22.828
Sometimes it's hard to actually

02:13:22.894 --> 02:13:25.097
communicate that out on I think

02:13:25.163 --> 02:13:26.765
it's really important but I

02:13:26.832 --> 02:13:33.138
think that I was telling on the

02:13:33.205 --> 02:13:35.006
council.

02:13:35.073 --> 02:13:37.042
I think that if we could start

02:13:37.109 --> 02:13:38.577
something there with the schools

02:13:38.643 --> 02:13:40.979
it would be amazing because the

02:13:41.046 --> 02:13:42.981
ages that we see that happening

02:13:43.048 --> 02:13:44.950
it started hurting I felt.

02:13:45.016 --> 02:13:47.319
Really able to a really young

02:13:47.386 --> 02:13:47.919
age but it is happening there

02:13:47.986 --> 02:13:49.154
another part that I do want to

02:13:49.221 --> 02:13:50.922
say is that the long park police

02:13:50.989 --> 02:13:51.556
department has done an amazing

02:13:51.623 --> 02:13:54.860
job. To keep me that because

02:13:54.926 --> 02:13:57.095
when they can't to the victims

02:13:57.162 --> 02:13:58.864
the one that talks to them with

02:13:58.930 --> 02:14:00.766
myself.

02:14:00.832 --> 02:14:03.535
So often apple my with their you

02:14:03.602 --> 02:14:05.103
recess on my part to the offices

02:14:05.170 --> 02:14:07.239
of Adam at first they were not

02:14:07.305 --> 02:14:08.907
sure what it was.

02:14:08.974 --> 02:14:10.942
I did a little bit of research --

02:14:11.009 --> 02:14:13.111
Was able to do that the last two

02:14:13.178 --> 02:14:15.347
thousand and also I think it's

02:14:15.414 --> 02:14:16.848
really important every year --

02:14:16.915 --> 02:14:17.482
I do want to get some of your

02:14:17.549 --> 02:14:25.023
information so I could take back

02:14:25.090 --> 02:14:26.825
to one point --

02:14:26.892 --> 02:14:29.227
To take somebody's officers of

02:14:29.294 --> 02:14:30.796
the park.

02:14:30.862 --> 02:14:34.833
Don't really understand so I can

02:14:34.900 --> 02:14:35.434
think you and it's an honor to

02:14:35.500 --> 02:14:36.902
be.

02:14:36.968 --> 02:14:38.837
Thank you for and I want to

02:14:38.904 --> 02:14:39.137
welcome --

02:14:39.204 --> 02:14:41.239
Councilmember cruise back up

02:14:41.306 --> 02:14:44.709
from the city bottom park I

02:14:44.776 --> 02:14:52.818
missed you earlier something can.

02:14:52.884 --> 02:14:55.086
The room is an armor public

02:14:55.153 --> 02:14:57.322
safety commissioner here in the

02:14:57.389 --> 02:14:59.024
city of the wording [inaudible]

02:14:59.090 --> 02:15:03.395
And I'm seventy years old and I

02:15:03.462 --> 02:15:03.662
just now.

02:15:03.728 --> 02:15:05.030
Learned about domestic violence

02:15:05.096 --> 02:15:06.731
and I don't mean today.

02:15:06.798 --> 02:15:09.167
But about three weeks ago I was

02:15:09.234 --> 02:15:09.634
on a trial [inaudible]

02:15:09.701 --> 02:15:15.073
Which but selecting was.

02:15:15.140 --> 02:15:17.008
I guess for the very difficult

02:15:17.075 --> 02:15:19.211
but we had a lot of women that

02:15:19.277 --> 02:15:20.912
actually got up and spoke.

02:15:20.979 --> 02:15:25.016
And that were dismissed.

02:15:25.083 --> 02:15:27.052
And it was a key because each of

02:15:27.118 --> 02:15:28.753
them had been victims of of a

02:15:28.820 --> 02:15:32.691
domestic violence and down.

02:15:32.757 --> 02:15:34.993
The first question the judge

02:15:35.060 --> 02:15:36.928
asked Japan was.

02:15:36.995 --> 02:15:38.864
Did you call the police is a

02:15:38.930 --> 02:15:42.868
report on and there were.

02:15:42.934 --> 02:15:44.703
The vast majority this it bill.

02:15:44.769 --> 02:15:47.205
And they said because they

02:15:47.272 --> 02:15:47.672
wouldn't do anything.

02:15:47.739 --> 02:15:51.443
And one actually in the in the

02:15:51.510 --> 02:15:53.178
more people to get it in a funny

02:15:53.245 --> 02:15:54.813
way than the way it was meant

02:15:54.880 --> 02:15:58.850
that she had actually said that --

02:15:58.917 --> 02:16:00.785
She didn't call and but the

02:16:00.852 --> 02:16:03.121
neighbor did because it was a

02:16:03.188 --> 02:16:04.923
fight next door and they were

02:16:04.990 --> 02:16:06.925
complaining about the noise.

02:16:06.992 --> 02:16:08.760
An officer showed up.

02:16:08.827 --> 02:16:11.329
And her husband had to be here

02:16:11.396 --> 02:16:14.866
and the officers saw her all

02:16:14.933 --> 02:16:15.534
bloodied been basically is said

02:16:15.600 --> 02:16:17.168
this is a domestic matter and we

02:16:17.235 --> 02:16:18.770
really don't handle these things.

02:16:18.837 --> 02:16:22.974
So he left and she said she went

02:16:23.041 --> 02:16:25.343
to the bathroom clean up and

02:16:25.410 --> 02:16:25.744
sure enough when.

02:16:25.810 --> 02:16:28.980
When -- She

02:16:29.047 --> 02:16:29.614
was nice and clean and the cop

02:16:29.681 --> 02:16:31.383
was nice and gone he beat her

02:16:31.449 --> 02:16:31.783
again [inaudible]

02:16:31.850 --> 02:16:36.888
And it.

02:16:36.955 --> 02:16:39.291
Really chair perspective during

02:16:39.357 --> 02:16:42.661
the campaña hearings because

02:16:42.727 --> 02:16:44.696
when I heard that women speaking.

02:16:44.763 --> 02:16:46.998
The victim in particular case

02:16:47.065 --> 02:16:48.700
you're handling.

02:16:48.767 --> 02:16:51.136
Responded almost directly the

02:16:51.202 --> 02:16:52.904
same way.

02:16:52.971 --> 02:16:53.572
There was not a lot a consistent

02:16:53.638 --> 02:16:54.773
see in the way she responded

02:16:54.839 --> 02:16:57.042
there was a lot of confusion.

02:16:57.108 --> 02:16:58.677
And pain --

02:16:58.743 --> 02:17:02.714
Have a heavy Spanish accent I

02:17:02.781 --> 02:17:05.083
request that the interpreter.

02:17:05.150 --> 02:17:05.483
Be brought in in.

02:17:05.550 --> 02:17:08.887
They decided to ask her about

02:17:08.954 --> 02:17:09.521
that at first she said no and

02:17:09.588 --> 02:17:11.122
then she said yes and then

02:17:11.189 --> 02:17:12.991
finally she said she'd be more

02:17:13.058 --> 02:17:14.659
comfortable with the translator.

02:17:14.726 --> 02:17:16.861
And the purpose for my asking

02:17:16.928 --> 02:17:19.230
that was at the way she was

02:17:19.297 --> 02:17:21.333
industry and I kind of was very

02:17:21.399 --> 02:17:22.968
convinced that that her attitude

02:17:23.034 --> 02:17:24.970
was more from me language

02:17:25.036 --> 02:17:26.972
Berrier then from male

02:17:27.038 --> 02:17:27.272
[inaudible]

02:17:27.339 --> 02:17:28.673
A dramatic.

02:17:28.740 --> 02:17:31.276
And it as it turned out her

02:17:31.343 --> 02:17:34.980
answers didn't changes she was

02:17:35.046 --> 02:17:38.917
cold in Spanish --

02:17:38.984 --> 02:17:39.484
Essay questions [inaudible]

02:17:39.551 --> 02:17:42.921
And what was difficult for us is

02:17:42.988 --> 02:17:43.221
that -- We

02:17:43.288 --> 02:17:44.689
were told in the instructions.

02:17:44.756 --> 02:17:46.958
That.

02:17:47.025 --> 02:17:48.693
There had to be.

02:17:48.760 --> 02:17:50.996
Reasonable doubt it if it was

02:17:51.062 --> 02:17:52.697
her word against his word.

02:17:52.764 --> 02:17:54.799
We have to take his word unless

02:17:54.866 --> 02:17:57.002
there was something there

02:17:57.068 --> 02:17:57.435
profoundly made that

02:17:57.502 --> 02:17:57.736
[inaudible]

02:17:57.802 --> 02:18:01.306
And in. Two of the three charges

02:18:01.373 --> 02:18:03.008
we were able to find something

02:18:03.074 --> 02:18:05.043
different and we're able to find

02:18:05.110 --> 02:18:06.745
him guilty.

02:18:06.811 --> 02:18:09.214
But in the third which I thought

02:18:09.280 --> 02:18:11.249
was probably the most heinous of

02:18:11.316 --> 02:18:13.118
the three that was just the two

02:18:13.184 --> 02:18:15.153
of them his word against hers so

02:18:15.220 --> 02:18:16.755
we had to find him not guilty.

02:18:16.821 --> 02:18:19.024
This.

02:18:19.090 --> 02:18:20.992
Is route three I think were the

02:18:21.059 --> 02:18:22.961
just Justin --

02:18:23.028 --> 02:18:26.831
Discourages people from going in.

02:18:26.898 --> 02:18:28.733
And the way his attorney can't

02:18:28.800 --> 02:18:31.069
describe her.

02:18:31.136 --> 02:18:32.937
Was not what we are you know she

02:18:33.004 --> 02:18:35.073
basically was in Pierce was

02:18:35.140 --> 02:18:35.373
basically.

02:18:35.440 --> 02:18:39.077
Still traumatized and she was

02:18:39.144 --> 02:18:41.012
basically trying. To answer

02:18:41.079 --> 02:18:42.914
questions but she was scared.

02:18:42.981 --> 02:18:45.216
But we could use that instant

02:18:45.283 --> 02:18:47.252
what we had to use against them

02:18:47.318 --> 02:18:48.720
was.

02:18:48.787 --> 02:18:49.354
Evidence to support it in one of

02:18:49.421 --> 02:18:54.726
the our of come.

02:18:54.793 --> 02:18:57.028
He had actually admitted it to

02:18:57.095 --> 02:18:59.097
an officer after he refuses

02:18:59.164 --> 02:19:01.066
Miranda rights and told the

02:19:01.132 --> 02:19:05.103
officer that he in the first.

02:19:05.170 --> 02:19:05.770
One it was his attorney speaking

02:19:05.837 --> 02:19:08.773
for him that basically convicted

02:19:08.840 --> 02:19:11.242
him because she made in exchange

02:19:11.309 --> 02:19:14.879
for the first charge but in the

02:19:14.946 --> 02:19:17.015
opening and closing statements

02:19:17.082 --> 02:19:19.050
she changed her story local.

02:19:19.117 --> 02:19:20.952
But the consistency was.

02:19:21.019 --> 02:19:23.021
That he had done.

02:19:23.088 --> 02:19:23.488
What he was accused of

02:19:23.555 --> 02:19:23.788
[inaudible]

02:19:23.855 --> 02:19:24.756
So.

02:19:24.823 --> 02:19:26.958
I think this is were.

02:19:27.025 --> 02:19:30.729
We need to you know as a as a

02:19:30.795 --> 02:19:33.098
society --

02:19:33.164 --> 02:19:35.200
Find a way of working with these

02:19:35.266 --> 02:19:35.433
people.

02:19:35.500 --> 02:19:38.636
Getting them you know beyond

02:19:38.703 --> 02:19:40.972
their their trauma it don't mean.

02:19:41.039 --> 02:19:41.606
Get him out of it and forget it

02:19:41.673 --> 02:19:43.041
I mean.

02:19:43.108 --> 02:19:45.310
Help them to get to the point to

02:19:45.376 --> 02:19:46.711
where they can communicate.

02:19:46.778 --> 02:19:49.214
What's going on because this is

02:19:49.280 --> 02:19:50.715
for the courts.

02:19:50.782 --> 02:19:52.951
Let them down.

02:19:53.017 --> 02:19:55.220
And you know and to tell you

02:19:55.286 --> 02:19:59.057
that my wife and I we've been

02:19:59.124 --> 02:19:59.324
together.

02:19:59.390 --> 02:20:00.792
About forty four years and I

02:20:00.859 --> 02:20:03.328
when we saw the the hearings she

02:20:03.394 --> 02:20:05.029
actually defended Cavanaugh

02:20:05.096 --> 02:20:06.798
because she thought this woman

02:20:06.865 --> 02:20:08.867
waited way too long. To bring

02:20:08.933 --> 02:20:11.002
this out and I had just.

02:20:11.069 --> 02:20:13.004
Found out you know first hand

02:20:13.071 --> 02:20:14.739
why they didn't bring it out.

02:20:14.806 --> 02:20:16.841
So.

02:20:16.908 --> 02:20:17.509
I think I got a really different

02:20:17.575 --> 02:20:21.079
perspective on the at least

02:20:21.146 --> 02:20:22.847
under to know why we were coming

02:20:22.914 --> 02:20:24.749
back explaining.

02:20:24.816 --> 02:20:27.085
Things if they had gone --

02:20:27.152 --> 02:20:28.953
To through.

02:20:29.020 --> 02:20:30.755
And this is where we need.

02:20:30.822 --> 02:20:35.093
To basically bring along into

02:20:35.160 --> 02:20:35.693
line with what's happening.

02:20:35.760 --> 02:20:38.963
And I don't think that.

02:20:39.030 --> 02:20:39.197
That --

02:20:39.264 --> 02:20:41.132
Judges shouldn't go through

02:20:41.199 --> 02:20:42.734
trapping also I think they

02:20:42.801 --> 02:20:45.036
really do need to because I

02:20:45.103 --> 02:20:46.938
think that you know like I said

02:20:47.005 --> 02:20:48.640
between my wife and I we have

02:20:48.706 --> 02:20:49.240
two different views known is

02:20:49.307 --> 02:20:51.142
because I've been on one of

02:20:51.209 --> 02:20:52.744
these files and she hasn't

02:20:52.811 --> 02:20:53.044
[inaudible]

02:20:53.111 --> 02:20:56.948
And it's just the way it

02:20:57.015 --> 02:20:58.917
basically perspective and it's

02:20:58.983 --> 02:21:00.985
what you see.

02:21:01.052 --> 02:21:01.186
Now.

02:21:01.252 --> 02:21:02.921
Prior to that.

02:21:02.987 --> 02:21:03.321
I was assigned.

02:21:03.388 --> 02:21:05.356
Rated based that's what I did

02:21:05.423 --> 02:21:07.058
for a living and is science you

02:21:07.125 --> 02:21:09.093
basically research everything

02:21:09.160 --> 02:21:09.694
you have an order the you put

02:21:09.761 --> 02:21:10.795
things in.

02:21:10.862 --> 02:21:13.064
And really I think is what

02:21:13.131 --> 02:21:14.799
prevented me from even seen

02:21:14.866 --> 02:21:17.135
another side of possibility.

02:21:17.202 --> 02:21:18.837
But I don't think that's just me

02:21:18.903 --> 02:21:20.839
I think that's people in in

02:21:20.905 --> 02:21:21.472
general and that's really what

02:21:21.539 --> 02:21:23.141
needs to be.

02:21:23.208 --> 02:21:27.011
Communicated is finding a way of

02:21:27.078 --> 02:21:31.049
of making the nearly

02:21:31.115 --> 02:21:31.349
[inaudible]

02:21:31.416 --> 02:21:31.683
Communities.

02:21:31.749 --> 02:21:31.916
Aware.

02:21:31.983 --> 02:21:34.652
Of what to look for what to see.

02:21:34.719 --> 02:21:36.788
And one the woman that was

02:21:36.855 --> 02:21:40.658
actually interviewing Cavanah.

02:21:40.725 --> 02:21:43.127
Accuser.

02:21:43.194 --> 02:21:44.996
That I found very valuable.

02:21:45.063 --> 02:21:46.865
And that is it.

02:21:46.931 --> 02:21:48.867
Somebody tell in a wider fairly

02:21:48.933 --> 02:21:51.035
consistent in.

02:21:51.102 --> 02:21:52.804
Somebody is telling the truth it

02:21:52.871 --> 02:21:53.371
actually varies a little.

02:21:53.438 --> 02:21:54.739
Each time because there's some

02:21:54.806 --> 02:21:57.375
emotion and some thought it to

02:21:57.442 --> 02:21:59.177
what's happening and that was

02:21:59.244 --> 02:22:01.412
what I saw exactly in the young

02:22:01.479 --> 02:22:02.680
lady that.

02:22:02.747 --> 02:22:03.314
Brought the charges [inaudible]

02:22:03.381 --> 02:22:08.853
But it's more than just a

02:22:08.920 --> 02:22:10.922
complicated issue is something

02:22:10.989 --> 02:22:11.322
that we really.

02:22:11.389 --> 02:22:12.690
Do need.

02:22:12.757 --> 02:22:15.193
To find new ways to address and

02:22:15.260 --> 02:22:19.163
new ways. To to work with.

02:22:19.230 --> 02:22:21.032
It is not a new problem it's a

02:22:21.099 --> 02:22:23.268
very old problems just a new way

02:22:23.334 --> 02:22:26.738
of using the and that's where.

02:22:26.804 --> 02:22:27.305
You like trying to come in.

02:22:27.372 --> 02:22:29.340
And fortunately you know I do

02:22:29.407 --> 02:22:31.109
have what they call it mark

02:22:31.175 --> 02:22:32.844
phone.

02:22:32.911 --> 02:22:36.915
But I'm done with a user.

02:22:36.981 --> 02:22:38.750
So.

02:22:38.816 --> 02:22:42.921
I get my kids will talk to you

02:22:42.987 --> 02:22:43.254
it takes me.

02:22:43.321 --> 02:22:45.356
So I had to get a phone that

02:22:45.423 --> 02:22:46.958
would let me.

02:22:47.025 --> 02:22:49.294
Get text program and when I did

02:22:49.360 --> 02:22:51.296
I don't use [inaudible]

02:22:51.362 --> 02:22:55.400
But what is the difference is

02:22:55.466 --> 02:22:57.068
what's happened in my generation

02:22:57.135 --> 02:22:58.870
is happening now is just a

02:22:58.937 --> 02:23:01.172
modern way of doing it.

02:23:01.239 --> 02:23:02.807
And their generation is gonna

02:23:02.874 --> 02:23:06.945
deal with that is a to get older

02:23:07.011 --> 02:23:07.578
they're going to find there's no

02:23:07.645 --> 02:23:08.813
ways of of communicating so this

02:23:08.880 --> 02:23:10.915
is going to be an ongoing thing

02:23:10.982 --> 02:23:11.215
but what.

02:23:11.282 --> 02:23:13.051
They all have in common is

02:23:13.117 --> 02:23:14.786
understanding.

02:23:14.852 --> 02:23:16.688
And knowing what to look.

02:23:16.754 --> 02:23:17.021
For thank you.

02:23:17.088 --> 02:23:23.294
Thank you. For the for the

02:23:23.361 --> 02:23:23.962
clothing because I think when we

02:23:24.028 --> 02:23:26.698
started the conversation we talk

02:23:26.764 --> 02:23:27.298
about how domestic violence

02:23:27.365 --> 02:23:29.133
doesn't see color.

02:23:29.200 --> 02:23:31.269
Doesn't see gender doesn't see --

02:23:31.336 --> 02:23:33.004
Sexual orientation doesn't see

02:23:33.071 --> 02:23:38.977
socioeconomic status and the the

02:23:39.043 --> 02:23:40.912
response is that yes we can try

02:23:40.979 --> 02:23:42.981
and fix the courts by the state

02:23:43.047 --> 02:23:44.749
my behind.

02:23:44.816 --> 02:23:45.416
That being a victim of domestic

02:23:45.483 --> 02:23:48.820
violence until we can --

02:23:48.886 --> 02:23:50.788
At least get big to to speak up

02:23:50.855 --> 02:23:51.422
we can fix the court system but

02:23:51.489 --> 02:23:53.291
if there's nobody going to the

02:23:53.358 --> 02:23:54.625
court systems --

02:23:54.692 --> 02:23:55.226
Because they're not reporting

02:23:55.293 --> 02:23:57.228
their abuse that's where would

02:23:57.295 --> 02:23:57.862
that challenge life and I think

02:23:57.929 --> 02:23:59.030
we can do both and I want to

02:23:59.097 --> 02:24:01.232
thank all the panelists today

02:24:01.299 --> 02:24:02.967
all of them are members of the

02:24:03.034 --> 02:24:04.936
audience for being here.

02:24:05.003 --> 02:24:07.005
Again -- We

02:24:07.071 --> 02:24:10.875
would like this.

02:24:10.942 --> 02:24:12.944
And action bad like I said

02:24:13.011 --> 02:24:15.113
before I'm committed to because

02:24:15.179 --> 02:24:16.748
of my personal experience with

02:24:16.814 --> 02:24:18.750
my sister but because of the

02:24:18.816 --> 02:24:19.350
experiences of so many people

02:24:19.417 --> 02:24:21.152
that I've met in the last two

02:24:21.219 --> 02:24:21.419
years --

02:24:21.486 --> 02:24:25.123
Count on me as a supporter but

02:24:25.189 --> 02:24:25.323

02:24:25.390 --> 02:24:27.091
I learn something new every time

02:24:27.158 --> 02:24:29.293
we have a hearing and I need you

02:24:29.360 --> 02:24:31.095

02:24:31.162 --> 02:24:33.297
these fields to let us know what

02:24:33.364 --> 02:24:34.699
you think fix would be.

02:24:34.766 --> 02:24:37.035
Whether the money or like --

02:24:37.101 --> 02:24:39.470
The the detective stated not

02:24:39.537 --> 02:24:40.805
everything takes money so help

02:24:40.872 --> 02:24:43.007
me figure out policies that

02:24:43.074 --> 02:24:44.809
might be able to be implemented

02:24:44.876 --> 02:24:45.476
without that money so that there

02:24:45.543 --> 02:24:46.978
