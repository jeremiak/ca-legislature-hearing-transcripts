HERE SENATOR WIENER. ARE YOU READY TO PRESENT SENATOR. GOOD MORNING. AND YOU HAVE SB -- SIXTY NINE SO GO HEAD WHENEVER YOU'RE READY SIR. THANK YOU -- MISTER VICE CHAIR -- BEFORE I WOULD BE AND I WILL -- EXCEPT THE COMMITTEES TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS -- SPAMMER PRITCHETT THE COMMITTEE ON THE CREATES TOUGH WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL -- SB SIXTY NINE WHICH IS THE OCEAN RESILIENCY OCT -- TO TWENTY NINETEEN WILL HELP RESTORE HABITATS AND ENCOURAGE PRACTICES THAT INCREASE SEQUESTRATION OF A SO CALLED BLUE CARBON. SEC -- I SUCH AS THE BENEFICIAL REUSE THE MARINE SETTLEMENTS TO BUILD OPERATOR WETLANDS. EXCUSE ME WE ALSO NEED TO PROTECT OUR ECOLOGICALLY CRITICAL SPECIES INCLUDING THOSE. ON WHICH COASTAL ECONOMIES RELY -- THE BILL WILL PROTECT WHALES BY CODIFYING AN EXISTING VOLUNTARY PROGRAM AIMED AT PREVENTING SHIP STRIKES. SB SIXTY NINE ALSO TAKES A NUMBER OF LONG OVERDUE STOPS. TO BEGIN REBUILDING OUR SALMON FISHERIES INCLUDING PLACING NEW PROTECTIONS ON THE FORESTS STREAMS OF WHERE THEY SPAWN. AND I'VE BEEN -- ALTHOUGH -- WANT TO SAY I KNOW THERE WAS A LETTER FROM THE TIMBER INDUSTRY -- WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE TIMBER INDUSTRY FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF THIS LEGISLATION -- THERE IS SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS AND THE SENATE THAT ADDRESSED THE LION'S SHARE OF THE TIMBER INDUSTRY'S OBJECTIONS. WHICH HAS MADE FURTHER AMENDMENTS LAST WEEK TO ADDRESS MORE OBJECTIONS. AND SO I JUST WANNA MAKE CLEAR THAT THE TIMBER INDUSTRIES OBJECTIONS TO THE BILL -- THOUGH IT IS DRAMATICALLY SMALLER THAN WHAT IT WAS WE DID RECEIVE THEIR VERY TECHNICAL LADDER LATE LAST WEEK WE ARE REVIEWING IT -- AND I'M CONFIDENT THEY'LL BE SOME ASPECTS OF IT THAT WILL BE ABLE. TO ACCEPT BUT WE HAVE NOT FULLY EVALUATED AT YEAH AND WILL CONTINUE. TO WORK WITH THE TIMBER INDUSTRY AS WE HAVE FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE BILL. THIS MEASURE -- AND ITS VARIOUS PROVISIONS WILL HELP ENSURE THE CALIFORNIA HAS THE STRATEGY AND THE ABILITY TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON OUR OCEANS. TO SEQUESTER GREATER AMOUNTS OF CARBON UNTIL THE COASTAL COMMUNITIES TO CONTINUE THEIR WAY OF LIFE INTO THE FUTURE. RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE -- WITH ME -- TODAY ARE CAITLYN KALU OF THE CALIFORNIA COAST OPPENHEIM OF THE PACIFIC COAST FEDERATION OF FISHERMEN'S ASSOCIATIONS THANK YOU OKAY. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. A GOOD MORNING THANK YOU CAITLYN COLUSA WITH THE CALIFORNIA COAST KEEPER ALLIANCE -- I AM WHICH REPRESENTS LOCAL WATER KEEPERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE BIG FROM THE ORGAN BORDERED ON THE SAN DIEGO AS WELL AS INLAND INTO SIERRA. I'M SPEAKING TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL SIXTY NINE A CRITICAL ACTION ORIENTED BILL TO INCREASE THE RESILIENCE OF CALIFORNIA'S MARINE AND COASTAL ENVIRONMENTS CLIMATE CHANGE. GLOBAL CARBON EMISSIONS ARE DRIVING CHANGES TO OCEAN CHEMISTRY. AND A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH IS NEEDED TO INCREASE THE VIABILITY AND SURVIVAL OF MARINE AQUATIC SPECIES TO THE CHANGES THAT ARE DRIVEN BY CLIMATE CHANGE. SB SIXTY NINE OUTLINES CRITICAL STATEWIDE. ACTIONS CALIFORNIACAN TAKE NOW TO INCREASE THE RESILIENCE OF INDIVIDUAL AQUATIC SPECIES AND ECOSYSTEMS CLIMATE CHANGE BY REMOVING CURRENT THREATS AND BOLSTERING THE ECOSYSTEMS OF THESE KEYSTONE SPECIES. THREE CRITICAL COMPONENTS I'M GONNA HIGHLIGHT TO YOU TODAY ARE THE BENEFICIAL REUSE OF JUDGE THAT MEANT FOR BUT WHEN RESTORATION ACROSS ALONG THE COAST. OVER THE PAST CENTURY MOST OF CALIFORNIA'S WETLANDS HAVE BEEN FILLED OR CONVERTED TO OTHER USES LEAVING THE STATE WITH 10% OF ITS HISTORIC WETLANDS. SB SIX NINE WILL HELP CALIFORNIA CHIEF IT'S NO NET LOSS POLICY. I'M BY AND ALSO SUPPORT WILL THROUGH SUPPORTING BENEFICIAL REUSE OF JUDGE SETTLEMENT FOR RIGHT WING RESTORATION WHICH PROVIDES CRITICAL HABITAT FOR NUMBER OF COASTAL SPECIES AS WELL AS MIGRATORY BIRDS. AS OLD PERSON PROTECTS COASTAL COMMUNITIES FROM SEAT RISING SEA LEVELS INCREASE STORM SURGE. SB SIXTY NINE ALSO ENCOURAGES THE VOLUNTARY VESSEL SPEED REDUCTION PROGRAM. I'M WHICH ACTUALLY BUILDS FROM A PILOT PROGRAM AT THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE SANTA BARBARA CHANNEL IN SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA THAT HOUSES GOT SUCCESSFULLY. REDUCE THE NUMBER OF FATAL WILL STRIKES AS WELL AS DECREASE THAT SMOG PRODUCING. EMISSIONS LONGER BECAUSE BY OVER TWO HUNDRED SIXTY TONS I SB SIXTY NINE WILL EXPAND. THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROGRAM -- AS WELL AS FINALLY. SB SIXTY NINE WILL IMPROVE INSTREAM FLOW FOR CRITICAL SPEECH -- SALMON SPECIES AND OTHER FISH -- SALMON AND OTHER FISH SPECIES ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT IN THAT THE CONNECT FRESH WATER IN MARINE ECOSYSTEMS. SB SIXTY NINE WILL REVIVE EXISTING REQUIREMENTS TO DETERMINE AND MAINTAIN THE MINIMUM INSTREAM FLOW TO PROTECT THESE CRITICAL FISH SPECIES. I GATHER THESE PROGRAMS AND SPECIFIC ACTIONS WILL PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS TO COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS AND THE RESILIENCE OF MARINE SPECIES BY MITIGATING THREATS. POSED TO THE SPECIES BECAUSE OF THESE EXPLICIT ACTIONS AND THAT THESE ARE NOT SIMPLY PLANS. ARE WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF SB SIXTY NINE TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR. ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S. NO OPPENHEIM WITH THE PACIFIC COAST FEDERATION OF FISHERMEN'S ASSOCIATIONS OF COURSE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. AS ORGANIZATION IS A CO SPONSOR AND I WANT TO TAKE OUR TIME TODAY DID SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT WHERE THIS BILL WAS AND WHERE IT'S COME. TO OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT SALMON FISHERIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN DEEPLY DEPRESSED IN THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES FISHERMEN ONCE NUMBER OVER. FOUR THOUSAND IN THE COMMERCIAL SECTOR WE NOW HAVE FEWER THAN FOUR HUNDRED FISHMAN ACTIVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE RECOVERY AND THIS BILL DOES SO IN A NUMBER OF SURGICAL AND EFFECTIVE WAYS. WE'LL TALK FIRST ABOUT THE WORK THAT THIS BILL WOULD DO TO ENHANCE OUR STATES HATCHERY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. COULD UNDERTAKE THERE ARE THREE SECTIONS RELEVANT TO THAT TREE PROGRAM [inaudible] ONE WOULD. L. AUGMENT THE EXISTING OFFSITE RELEASE PROGRAM WITH A NEW A NET PEN RELEASE ON THE COAST. THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE PROGRAM THIS IS A LIFE LINE FOR THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL. SALMON ECONOMY THE SECOND SECTION OF THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE STATE TO IN PERIODS OF DROUGHT. MOVE FISH OFF SITE TO RELEASE THEM IN RIVER IN STRATEGIC WAYS PIONEERED BY FOLKS LIKE THE MANAGERS OF THE EAST BAY MUD CO MANAGE MCCAULEY RIVER HATCHERY WHICH IS AN EXTERNALLY EXTRAORDINARILY EFFECTIVE PROGRAM. THE THIRD IT WOULD BE A HOLISTIC PROGRAM -- TO INSTITUTE REFORMS IN THE WHOLE CALIFORNIA HATCHERY PROGRAM THINGS LIKE -- PARISHES BASED TAGGING ANOTHER. REFORMS THAT WOULD GET THE PROGRAM MODERNIZED IN LINE WITH THE REST OF THE WEST COAST STATES AND WE WORKED ON THAT PARTICULAR SECTION WITH. METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT IN THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS TO REMOVE THEIR OPPOSITION AND TO GET TO A POINT WHERE WE FEEL THAT WE CAN WORK IN TANDEM WITH THE WATER USE OUR COMMUNITY TO ENHANCE THIS PROGRAM. ON THE TIMBER HARVEST SECTIONS. THE THE BILL HAS BEEN REFINED SIGNIFICANTLY AS SENATOR WIENER SAID MOVING FROM. A PRETTY BROAD AND AND ARGUABLY -- ON ORTHODOX APPROACH -- TO REGULATORY REFORM TO PRIORITIZING SOME KEY AND CRITICALLY IMPORTANT OF REMEDIAL EFFORTS FOR A TARGETED LIST OF WATER COURSES ONLY THOSE WATER BODIES THAT ARE IMPAIRED FOR THE POLLUTANT SENTIMENT. THAT ARE KNOWN TO PRODUCE SALMON. EXCLUSIVELY AND TARGETING NO OTHER AREAS THOSE AREAS ARE KNOWN TO BE IN NEED OF OF THIS SIGNIFICANT REMEDIATION AND WE KNOW THAT REMEDIATION FROM TIMBER HARVEST PRACTICES USING THE APPROACHES THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING WITH COMMITTEE STAFF WILL. IMPROVE THE SITUATION ON THE STREAMS WE ARE WORKING ON PUTTING TOGETHER A RESPONSE TO THE TECHNICAL SUGGESTIONS THAT THE TIMBER INDUSTRY HAS MADE. AND BECAUSE THE NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE IS THE COMMITTEE OF JURISDICTION OVER THOSE EFFORTS THAT'S WHERE THOSE CHANGES WILL BE MADE AND WE CAN ASSURE YOU NOW THAT THOSE THERE WILL BE TECHNICAL CHANGES MADE IN ONE WEEK'S TIME OF THAT COMMITTEE -- AND WITH THAT I'D STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT AND I FEEL LIKE WE WILL HAVE. A DEEP CONVERSATION HERE IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION. I THANK YOU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING TO RESPECT WHICH ON BEHALF OF HEAL THE BAY IN SUPPORT. SIR SOLVE ANY ON BEHALF OF INLAND EMPIRE WATERKEEPER AND HUMBOLDT BAY KEEPER IN STRONG SUPPORT. NATALIE NEXT ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA TROUT IN SUPPORT. BRENNAN DAWSON OVER HAVE A SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA SUPPORT. I'M BETWEEN -- KATHY COLUMBIA OF THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS IN THE METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HERE REPRESENTING A HANDFUL OF UP WATER INTEREST WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE. OF PROPONENTS AS WELL AS COMMITTEE STAFF ALL OUR CONCERNS HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED THANK YOU. PHIL THISALISHA ON BEHALF OF THE PACIFIC MERCHANT SHIPPING ASSOCIATION WE HAVE A SUPPORT IF AMENDED POSITION AND WE ARE LOOKING SPECIFICALLY AT THE VESSEL SPEED REDUCTION SECTION OF THE PROGRAM WE WOULD LIKE SOME ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY REGARDING. SHIP SPEED SO WE WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION WITH THE AUTHOR IN THE BILL'S SPONSORS THANK YOU [inaudible] OKAY. ALL RIGHT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION YOUR SINGLE QUICKLY WITH A CALIFORNIA FORESTRY ASSOCIATION WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL -- A LITTLE HISTORY THE BILL WAS AMENDED -- LAST TUESDAY WE WORKED AS A COALITION TO GET A RESPONSE TO THOSE AMENDMENTS -- WITHIN FORTY EIGHT HOURS AND HAVE THAT OUT FOR EVERYONE'S -- PURVIEW -- WE ARE STILL OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THE BILL WAS THE SECTION THAT WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT BEFORE HAS BEEN REMOVED IT HAS BEEN REPLACED BY. TWO NEW ADDITIONAL SECTIONS THAT WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS OVER CONSENT AND BEYOND JUST TECHNICAL CONCERNS -- SO WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE AMENDMENTS ARE COMMITTED TO BEING TAKEN BEFORE THIS BILL MOVES OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE -- OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT -- CONCERN INVOLVES SECTION NINE WHICH REQUIRES THAT -- TIMBER HARVESTING IS PROHIBITED ON GROUNDS THAT SHOWS EVIDENCE OF EXTREME EROSION POTENTIAL UNLESS THE TEACH P. HAS BEEN APPROVED. BY A CERTIFIED ENGINEERING GEOLOGIST FIRST OF ALL THERE IS NO CURRENT DEFINITION FOR EXTREME EROSION CONTROL BUT RATHER EXTREME. EROSION HAZARD RATING AND SECONDLY THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION WHICH INCLUDES THE CALIFORNIA GEOLOGICAL SURVEY THEY ARE ALREADY A PART OF THE REVIEW TEAM FOR ALL TEACH PEAS WE WANT TO REQUEST THAT THE LANGUAGE STATE THE TIMBER HARVESTING ACTIVITY SHALL NOT BE UNDERTAKEN. UNDER TIMBER HARVESTING PLAN SUBJECT TO SUBDIVISION NAY ON GROUND SHOWS EVIDENCE OF EXTREME EROSION HAZARD RATING. UNLESS THE TIMBER HARVESTING PLAN HAS BEEN REVIEWED BY THE CALIFORNIA GEOLOGICAL SURVEY -- WE HAVE ASKED THE SPONSORS OF FOR THE IMPOTENCE OF THIS BILL AND WHY THEY THINK THAT IS NECESSARY TO REGULATE -- OUR TIMBER HARVESTING PLANS WHICH ARE CURRENTLY REGULATED BY THE BOARD OF FORESTRY CAL FIRE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION INCLUDING THE GEOLOGICAL SURVEY. AND THE REGIONAL WATER QUALITY CONTROL BOARDS -- AND IN RESPONSE TO THAT THEY GAVE US STUDIES WOULD WENT BACK AS FAR AS NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT OBVIOUSLY TIMBER HARVESTING PRACTICES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT. THAN THOSE THAT WERE DONE IN -- NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WE'VE HAD SIGNIFICANT UPGRADES IN THE RULES THROUGH THE BOARD OF FORESTRY AND WE THINK THAT'S WHAT'S MOST APPROPRIATE TODAY. MORNING MR MEMBERS BRING WHITE HERE FOR THE CALIFORNIA LICENSE FORCES ASSOCIATION AND FORCE MAMMALS OF CALIFORNIA WE TOO MUST RESPECTFULLY CONSIDER OPPOSE THE BILL A WE DON'T DISAGREE WITH SOME OF THE PROVISIONS IN THE BILL THE OVERALL CONTENT OF THE BILL WITH RESPECT TO OCEAN RESILIENCY. THAT'S A NOBLE A BECAUSE WE WE ARE NOT OPPOSING THOSE PROVISIONS IT IS THE SPECIFIC PROVISIONS ON THE FORTY PIECES OF THE BILL THAT ARE STILL CAUSING CONCERN. AND I'LL I'LL JUST WALK YOU THROUGH SOME OF THOSE THOSE ISSUES A GRAND ITS MOST OF THESE CONCERNS ARE PROBABLY THE PURVIEW OF THE SUMMING UP TO RESOURCE COMMITTEE BUT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ENOUGH FOR US TO RAISE THIS NOW. BECAUSE WE THINK THESE ARE VERY SUBSTANTIAL PROVISIONS NOT JUST TECHNICAL -- PROVISIONS AS AS WILL POINT OUT TO LICENSE FOR STILL SHE ATION WE ARE ACTUALLY THE STATE'S RENTS ARE PROFESSIONAL FORESTERS AND WE WORK FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ENTITIES. IN APPROVING TIMBER HARVEST PLANS. AT THIS POINT OUT TO TEACH PEACE ARE SINCE THE SICK LIKE DOCUMENTS AND LOOK AT EVERYTHING INCLUDING SETTLEMENT IN THE ROAD AND RELATED ISSUES WHICH STILL. THIS WHICH THIS BILL CHANGES UNDER THE PRESUMPTION THAT THE CURRENT PROCESSES IN WORKING ORDER. SO CALLED REDDITOR GAPS. THIS COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH THE T. H. P. PROCESS REQUIRES REGISTER PROFESSIONAL FORESTERS TO WORK WITH ALL THE STATUS AGENCIES THAT WERE LISTED INCLUDING. FOR FORESTRY PART OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. WE DON'T WATER QUALITY CONTROL BOARD AND APARTMENT CONSERVATION. THESE TEACH PEACE LAST BETWEEN FIVE AND SEVEN YEARS COST ABOUT DOLLARS EACH. SOLD THEIR NOT INSIGNIFICANT AND THEY MUST BE REVIEWED AND RENEWED EVERY FIVE SEVEN YEARS. THERE'S ANOTHER PROCESS CAUGHT THE NON TIMBER. MANAGEMENT PLAN THESE ARE FOR NON INDUSTRIAL CAM IMAGINE PLANS EITHER FOR SMALL LANDOWNERS WHICH ALSO REPRESENT. THESE ARE MORE -- OF TIMBER HARVEST PLANS ARE DONE FOR FOLKS THERE ARE ACTUALLY IN THE BUSINESS OF HARVESTING TREES FOR FOR PROFIT OR PRODUCTS. THEY DON'T TO MANAGE THE LANDS THEN USUALLY ABOUT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED ACRES OR LESS. AND ASSEMBLY THESE LANDOWNERS ARE ARE LAND RICH BUT THERE CASH PORCELAIN HAVE RESOURCES. TO SPEND THOUSAND SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS ON T. H. P. SO THEY GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS. DIFFERENCE THOUGH IS THAT THE IN TEAM P. AS A ONE TIME APPROVAL PROCESS IT LASTS FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THE OF THE PROJECT. AND LESS LANDER SUCH ACTION HARPER STREETS THEN THEY GO THROUGH WHAT'S CALLED THE T. H. P. R. OR I NOTICED OPERATE. THE PROCESS DOESN'T END JUST WITH THE T. H. P. OR THE NTP THE BORDER FORESTRY HAS DONE NUMEROUS THINGS OF THE LAST TEN YEARS INCLUDING THE THE SUMMIT PROTECTION RULES. THE ROAD RULES WHICH GET AT SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT I THINK THE SPONSORS TRYING ADDRESS WITH RESPECT THE SALMON PROTECTION. AND THERE'S ALSO BEEN ISSUES THAT ARE UNRELATED FORESTRY AS WE KNOW WITH WITH DROUGHT. THE MORE WATER WE HAVE THE SYSTEM THE BETTER IS FISH SPECIES AND THE DROUGHT WHILE STILL A CONCERN. AND WE MUST DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT IT HAS IMPROVED THIS SPECIES IN THE OCEAN. WHICH IS ACTUALLY A POINT OUT IN VARIOUS RECENT RECENT ARTICLES. I PUT ALL THIS OUT BECAUSE THE PROCESS IN THE NARRATIVE THAT IS UNTIL SORRY SIR LOOK FOR ME -- JUST REALLY QUICKLY ESTABLISHED QUORUM WHILE WE HAVE IT -- SO A MAN CLICK COULD YOU CALL THE ROLL. EDUARDO GARCIA GALLAGHER HERE GALLAGHER PRESENT BIGELOW. BIGELOW PRESENT CHOI HERE CHOI PRESENT [inaudible] TO FRIEDMAN. CRISTINA GARCIA. CRISTINA GARCIA PRESENT GLORIA. KALRA. KALRA PRESENT LEVINE. MATHIS. MATHIS PRESENT BLANCA RUBIO. LOCKER REVEAL PRESENT SALAS WOULD. WOULD PRESENT. OKAY. THANK YOU KNOW PLEASE PROCEED OF BUT PROJECT OR NOT THE PROMISED HER AND I'LL BE BRIEF I'LL WRAP THIS UP REAL QUICK SO OTHER FOLKS CAN CONSIGNMENT BUT UPON ALL THIS OUT SINCE BUT STATE THAT THE CURRENT PROCESS. IS WORKING IF THERE ARE EFFORTS AND NEEDED TO IMPROVE THE PROCESS. THOSE ARE PROBABLY MORE MORE LIKELY ADMINISTRATOR PROCESS WE DO AGREE WITH THE THE A PROVISION THE BILL WE KIND OF STUDY. TO SEE IF THERE'S MORE RECENT DATA OTHER THAN TWENTY TO THIRTY YEAR OLD DATA THAT. MR PICKY REFERENCE. THE BORDER FOR FREE I WILL KNOW IS CURRENTLY EMBARKING ON A STUDY SO THIS THE PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL SEEM TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE STUDY THAT'S GONNA BE CURRENTLY DOWN BY THE BOARD OF FORESTRY. AND FINALLY I'LL JUST MENTION SPECIFIC IN SECTION NINE OF THE BILL THIS IS THE MOST TROUBLING PIECE IN THE BILL. BECAUSE THEY SAID THE T. H. P. CANNOT BE APPROVED. ON GROUND THAT SHOWS EVIDENCE OF EXTREME EROSION CONTROL UNLESS APPROVED BY A GEOLOGIST CERTIFIED GEOLOGIST. THAT FLIPS THE PHP A PROPER WILL PROCESS ON MY MEMBERS WERE RICH OPPRESSION FORSTER'S BECAUSE THEY ARE THE LEGAL ENTITIES THAT APPROVED EACH PIECE WITH CAO CAO FIRE. SO WE CANNOT ACCEPT THAT PROVISION THE BILL SO THE AUTHOR AGREED TO TAKE. THAT PROVISION OUT AND MAKE IT MORE FOR A REVIEW PROCESS MORE THAN APPROVAL PROCESS. BY GEOLOGIST WHICH ARE COUNTY PART THE REVIEW TEAM ANYWAY. WE WILL BE MOST LIKELY OKAY WITH THIS BILL MOST OF THE BILL IS IS GOING TO BETTER DIRECTION EXCEPT FOR THAT PARTICULAR SECTION. SO WITH THOSE -- ISSUES -- MISTER WE WE ASK FOR OPPOSE LESS AMENDED LESS THAT BUSINESS ADDRESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU THIS NO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] NUMBER. ROBERT SIEGEL CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION I'D LIKETO LINE MY COMMENTS WITHOUT A BOTH THE CALIFORNIA FORESTRY ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA PRIVATE FOREST LANDOWNERS AND THE REGISTER PROFESSIONAL FORESTERS WE TOO ARE OPPOSING LESS AMENDED ON THIS AND AND AND FRANKLY. OUR CONCERN STEMS FROM THE IDEA THAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO PICK. WHICH INTO T. AND WHICH OPERATION WHICH COMMERCIAL OPERATION. IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEGRADATION OF THE SAME SPECIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND IN MY TEN YEARS OF EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE IN THE LEGISLATURE AND HAVING BEEN PART OF PROBABLY TWO DOZEN DIFFERENT HEARINGS BOTH INFORMATIONAL SUCH. FOR ON THIS VERY TOPIC. WE KNOW THAT IN FACT IT'S A COMBINATION OF MULTIPLE MULTIPLE -- MULTIPLE ISSUES DEPREDATION BEING. ONE CLIMATE CHANGE BEING ANOTHER. AS WELL AS HIS NAME NAME AND POSITION THANK YOU SIR ROBERT SIEGEL CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU. SALARY NEVER FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE. OKAY A BRING THEM. YES. AND THE COLLEGES I'VE I'VE WAS WANTING TO GIVE EVERYBODY A LITTLE BIT OF LIBERTY AND ELLIS IS A BIG BILL A LOT OF DIFFERENT ISSUES. YEAH SO -- ALL DIG IN YOU KNOW MAYBE FIRST HERE ON ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES. ONE SENATOR I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR WORKING -- PROACTIVELY WITH OPPOSITION ON ON THIS ISSUE AND IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE HAS BEEN PROGRESS MADE -- AND I KNOW THAT'S NOT TELL YOU THAT'S BEEN YOUR REPUTATION IS THAT YOU DO WORK THROUGH THESE DIFFERENT ISSUES AND SO APPRECIATE THAT -- I WANT TO START WITH SOME AGREEMENT THAT HAVE IS IS IN AND AND MAYBE SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT AS YOU'RE MOVING FORWARD IS. ON THIS RE USE OF SETTLEMENT -- AB I WAS TALKING WITH THIS FROM MY COLLEAGUE -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER MULLIN LAST YEAR ABOUT WE HAVE A HUGE AMOUNT OF SEDIMENT BUILDUP IN THE FEATHER RIVER. FOR INSTANCE -- OVER THE YEARS BUT WE HAD A BIG IMPACT AS A RESULT OF THE ORVILLE DISASTER. AND I AND I THOUGHT THAT THERE IS A REALLY BIG WIN WIN IF WE CAN SOMEHOW GET OUT THAT SEDIMENT BUILDUP. THIS BEEN GOING ON IN OUR AND AND SOME OF OUR RIVER SYSTEMS -- AND AND THEN RE USE THAT SETTLEMENT FOR EXAMPLE IN BUILDING YOU KNOW UP COASTLINES. YOU KNOW BEACH IS OVERSEEN THAT SIGNIFICANT EROSION -- THE OTHER IS EITHER A QUICK BARGE TRIP DOWN TO THE BAY OR YOU KNOW SOME WAY OF DOING THAT. WOULD IT WOULD ALSO BE A WIN FOR SALMON BECAUSE ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS WE HAVE IS THE SEDIMENTATION -- YOU KNOW IS COVERING UP SALMON SPAWNING BEDS RIGHT -- AND SO. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'VE YOU KNOW HAVE YOU HAD ANY CONVERSATIONS ON THAT FRONT OF REUSING I SEE THAT IS USING IT FROM THE REDWOOD CITY -- BAY. THERE BUT IF HAVE YOU CONSIDERED CONNECTING THIS TO LIKE REDUCE OF SENTIMENT THAT. YOU SAID IT MEANT -- REMEDIATION PROCESS IS -- PROJECTS IN RIVERS IN THE NORTH STATE FOR EXAMPLE AND USING THAT AS AS RECESS AT IMITATION IS THAT SOMETHING YOU GUYS HAVE TALKED ABOUT. IF I'M IN THIS VENTURE -- BENEFICIAL REUSE IS A IS A TREMENDOUSLY POPULAR PROGRAM IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR PREVENTING COASTAL EROSION IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE STATE WATER BOARDS BEEN WORKING ON FOR SOME TIME IN TERMS OF THE INLAND TO COASTAL CONNECTIVITY FROM AREAS AS FAR AWAY AS THE FEATHER. UNDER FOR KTRE STICKS AND UNFORTUNATELY AND KIND OF TOUGH TO ACCESS FROM A REGULATORY PERSPECTIVE IT'S IT'S A DAUNTING CHALLENGE ONE THAT WE CERTAINLY SUPPORT I MEAN. THIS BILL IS ABOUT. CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN RIGHT PERRIN INTEREST REAL AREAS AND COASTAL ECONOMIES THAT THOSE CONNECTIONS ARE DEEP THEIR THEIR COMPLEX AND WE NEED TO BE DOING BETTER -- I WOULD SAY THAT IS THE THE HISTORY OF THIS BILL HAS BEEN. FOCUS AND AND AND REFINEMENTS RATHER THAN EXPANSION BUT I'D I THINK THIS IS IDENTIFYING A KEY ISSUE. AND ONE THAT WOULD CERTAINLY LOVE TO WORK WITH THE ANA BUT AND THEN I HAD ASKED THE LOOK AT THE LOWER FOR THERIVER CORRIDOR MANAGEMENT. PLAN THAT WAS DEVELOPED BY IDW ARE -- SO THERE'S ALREADY A PLAN ON THE BOOKS ABOUT DOING SAID IN A MANAGEMENT IN THE LOWER FEATHER RIVER AND SO. MAYBE IT'S JUST A CONVERSATION AS AS MS FORD LIKE TRYING TO MAYBE SEE IF THERE'S A WAY TO CONNECT. TO SOME OF THOSE PLANS THAT ARE ALREADY IN PLACE HAPPY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION -- ALSO -- YOU KNOW ON THE HATCHERIES I MEAN I THINK THAT'S A HUGE ISSUE WE NEED TO I THINK THERE'S MORE WE CAN DO TO IMPROVE. YOU KNOW BOTH -- YOU KNOW THE THE SALMON POPULATION USING HATCHERY. USING THE HATCHERIES AND ALSO BETTER. YEAH -- I THINK THERE'S BEEN AND THERE'S SOME MUCH NEEDED IMPROVEMENT ON WHERE WE'RE RELEASING. JUVENILE SALMON AND WHEN WE'RE DOING IT -- AND AND AND MANY PEOPLE IN MY AREA BEEN VERY CRITICAL -- YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY THE THIS THE SPORTS FISHERMAN'S ASSOCIATION OTHERS ABOUT THESE WHEN THESE ARE BEING RELEASED HIS LIKE. AT A TIME WHEN PREDATORS ARE AT AN ALL TIME HIGH -- ME OF FOR EXAMPLE IS STRIPER -- AND SO WE YEAH WE LOSE A SIGNIFICANT POPULATION THERE JUST BASED ON WHEN THESE THINGS ARE HAPPENING SO IF WE CAN DO THINGS TO IMPROVE THAT I THINK THAT'S VERY KEY. AS THIS MOVES FORWARD -- ON THE ON THE FORESTRY SIDE AND I THINK ALL THIS ALL THIS COMES TO THIS COMMITTEE BECAUSE ULTIMATELY WHAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON HERE IS SALMON AND OUR WATER WAYS RIGHT -- AND HOW THEY ARE ALL CONNECTED. RIGHT ALL COME YOU KNOW FROM THE UPPER WATERSHED ALL THE WAY DOWN INTO THE BAY IS -- YOU KNOW THERE IS THAT CONNECTIVITY. WHAT I THINK WHERE THE A LOT OF THAT WHERE THE OPPOSITION IS COMING FROM? IS THAT THE SEDIMENTATION ISSUE IS NOT THERE'S NO DATA THAT SUGGESTS IS REALLY COMING FROM FORESTRY PRACTICES ANYMORE. WHEN WE WERE AT THE HEIGHT OF? NO TIMBER HARVEST. YOU KNOW THERE WAS STUDY SHOWING THAT BUT OBVIOUSLY HAS BEEN A LOT OF CHANGES. AN WELL RESTRICTIONS LIMITATIONS ON TIMBER HARVEST. AND SO YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OTHER SOURCES FOR THAT SEDIMENTATION TODAY -- YOU KNOW ONE OF THEM BEING JUST YOU KNOW LIKE WE SAID WE HAD THIS DISASTER ON OROVILLE DAM WHERE OR LIKE MILLIONS OF CUBIC YARDS OF OF MATERIAL WERE DUMPED INTO THE FEATHER RIVER. RIGHT -- YOU KNOW THERE'S DIFFERENT. YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE THAT -- CONTRIBUTED TO AND THERE'S NO. DATA HERE RECENTLY SUGGESTING THIS COMING FROM TIMBER HARVEST AND SO. I THINK ONE OF THE THOUGHTS WAS WHY NOT DO A NEW STUDY. YOUR OF HER KIND OF FORCE -- DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY TO DO A NEW STUDY TO SEE IF THAT IS IN FACT THE CASE AND OTHERWISE THERE IS A TIMBER HARVEST PLAN. PROSTHESES YOU KNOW PROCESS IS ALREADY IN PLACE I THINK THAT'S WHAT WAS BEING SAID A LOT ABOUT POSITION. THAT DOES CONSIDER ALL THESE ASPECTS. BEFORE TIMBER HARVEST PANT PLAN IS APPROVED -- AND AND UNLESS THERE'S LIKE A A REALLY STRONG JUSTIFICATION FOR DOING SO. YOU KNOW WHY SHOULD WE CHANGE THAT MAYBE THE FIRST THING FIRST AS A SAY HEY WHERE'S THE SEDIMENTATION. ISSUE COMING FROM RAY AND DO THIS AND MAKE THIS MORE FOCUSED ON THE STUDY OF THAT. FIRST. AND THEN TALK ABOUT WHAT THE POLICY SHOULD BE. ASSOCIATED THEIR WITH NOW I I I SEE THAT YOU DID CHANGE THAT. IN THE SAID. NO THERE WILL BE A STUDY IN A WILL BE UPDATED. ACCORDINGLY -- I THINK THERE'S MAYBE SOME QUIBBLING OVER THAT LANGUAGE BUT I THINK THE BIGGER ISSUE IS. THE THE REQUIREMENT THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A EROSION CONTROL IMPLEMENTATION PLAN -- SEPARATE AND APART FROM WHAT'S ALREADY INCLUDED IN THE T. H. P. PROCESS. RIGHT NOW AND MAYBE MAYBE COULD ADDRESS I MEAN I I THINK. WE'RE NOT HERE TO CLAIM THAT THE TIMBER INDUSTRY IS LIKE THE SOLE SOURCE OF OF SEGMENTATION OF REMEMBER SAID THAT AND BUT I I ALSO DON'T THINK IT'S THE CASE THAT IT'S NOT A FACTOR -- AT ALL. A AND SO AS YOU NOTED WE HAVE. MADE SOME CHANGES IN THAT IN THAT SECTION WE ALSO YOU KNOW WE THERE WAS OF THE ISSUE ABOUT THE REORDERING. OF WHICH AGENCIES WE'RE GONNA BE IN CONTROL WE TOOK THAT AL -- WE TOOK THAT SECTION AL AND IN THE LAST. AMENDMENTS. AND WE PUT OTHER MOMENTS IN THERE ARE NO CONCERNS ABOUT THAT. BUT I THINK I EVEN THOUGH WE STILL HAVE OPPOSITION IS NOW GONE FROM. OPPOSED TO OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED THAT'S PROGRESS -- AND WE HAVE YOU KNOW BEEN WILLING TO MAKE. A HAVE DIALOGUE AND MAKE AMENDS YOU KNOW THAT WE CAN AGREE. TO AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT -- BUT YOU KNOW. AND I WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT DIALOGUE AND THAT OPEN DOOR. RIGHT NOW AND I RESPECT THAT BUT IT A WHAT MY MY CONCERN IS THEY SEEM TO BE THE ONLY INDUSTRY THIS REALLY AFFECTED THOUGH THAT'S WERE HAVING THESE ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS ON TOP OF WHAT THEY ALREADYHAVE TO DO AS PART OF A TIMBER HARVEST PLAN. LIKE FOR INSTANCE I DON'T SEE ANYWHERE IN HERE. NEW REGULATIONS ON THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES AND HOW THEY OPERATE. ORVILLE. WHEN I WAS A HUGE INCREASE TO THE AMOUNT OF SEDIMENTATION THAT WE SAW IN THE FEATHER RIVER FOR EXAMPLE -- I DON'T SEE LIKE ADDITIONAL REGULATION ON ON THESE OTHER SOURCES RIGHT THAT THEY'RE PART OF THE SOURCE OF SEDIMENTATION THAT WERE SEEN. IT JUST SEEMS THAT THEY'RE THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS AN ADDITIONAL. REGULAR WITHOUT REALLY HAVING ANY NEW DATA. TO SUPPORT THAT I THINK THAT'S MY CONCERN I THINK. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY SAYING HEY THAT THEY SHOULD BE REVIEWED IN THE SHOULD BE OVERSIGHT OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING. IN TERMS OF THEIR TIMBER HARVEST -- I THINK THEY'RE JUST SAYING AND AN EIGHT AND I THINK THEY WOULD ARGUE THERE ALREADY IS A LOT OF THAT GOES INTO THAT PLAN THAT THEY HAVE TO CONSIDER -- BUT BEFORE WE ADD A NEW REQUIREMENT ON THEM. YOU KNOW SHOULD WE HAVE A STUDY THAT SHOWS THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE A SOURCE OF INCREASED SEDIMENTATION OR THAT THERE'S YOU KNOW A MORE RECENT STUDY THAT SHOWS THAT. IF I MAY THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION MISTER VICE CHAIR AT THE THE FACT THAT. NEARLY EVERY SINGLE MAJOR AND SIGNIFICANT SALMONBERRY WATER COURSE ON THE NORTH COAST IS LISTED FOR STATEMENT POLLUTION ON THE THREE A THREE D. LIST. IS A TESTAMENT TO THE FACT THAT THERE ARE LINGERING ONGOING PROBLEMS WHETHER THERE'D. CAUSED BY LEGACY PRACTICES. OR BUY NEW OPERATIONS THAT OCCURRED IN THE RECENT PAST THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT THESE AREAS ARE IMPAIRED AND REMEDIATION NEEDS TO OCCUR. WITH RESPECT TO THE POINTS THAT THE WITNESSES MADE ABOUT SECTION NINE ABOUT THE EXTREME HAZARD RATING AND APPROVAL BY GEOLOGICAL. SURVEY THOSE IN MY VIEW OUR TECHNICAL AND WE'RE I'M PERFECTLY WILLING TO SAY THAT WERE HAPPY TO WORK WITH COMMITTEE STAFF. AND THE OTHERS OFFICE TO ADDRESS THOSE PARTICULAR CONCERNS BUT TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT EROSION CONTROL PLANS OR ROAD IN CONTROL IMPLEMENTATION PLANS. EROSION CONTROL IS IN MY VIEW A CRITICAL PREREQUISITE FOR OPERATIONS THE REGION ONE BOARD IS ALREADY MOVING. TOWARD THE PROCESS FOR EROSION CONTROL PLANS IN. TIMBER OPERATIONS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF WHAT'S ENVISIONED IN THIS BILL. SO THERE'S THERE'S ALREADY A PROCESS MOVING FORWARD FOR THIS APPROACH AND FRANKLY IN MY VIEW. THESE THESE PLANS ARE A CRITICAL PART OF RESTORING AND REMEDIATING. THESE IMPAIRED WATERSHEDS AGAIN IT'S A SURGICAL APPROACH TO ONLY THE AREAS WE KNOW WHICH SEMINAR WHERE WE KNOW THEIR SENTIMENT PROBLEMS. AND THAT'S IT THE HUGE CONSOLIDATION REFINEMENT FROM PREVIOUS LANGUAGE WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE CONTINUE THE DISCOURSE AS WE MOVE THE PROCESS ALONG IN THERE JUST ONE FINAL QUESTION ISN'T EROSION CONTROL ALREADY CAN BE REQUIRED UNDER A T. H. P.. RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT. SO I MEAN DON'T THEY ALREADY HAVE THAT TOOL IS WHAT I'M SAYING SO WHY ADD ANOTHER. WELL IT WOULD IT IF I MAY. MISTER RUSSIA I BELIEVE THESE EROSION CONTROL PLANS WOULD LOOK VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT'S ALREADY IN MANY T. H. PEAS BUT THERE ARE MANY OTHERS THAT. COULD IN OUR VIEW -- HAVE THAT ADDITIONAL LEVEL OF PROTECTIONS AGAIN FOR THIS. VERY SMALL SET OF PHP IS THAT ARE AROUND -- ADJACENT TO THESE IMPAIRED SENATE BEARING WATERCOURSES. THANK YOU WE HAVE QUESTIONS FROM SOME MEMBER GARCIA PAULA BY MISTER MATHIS. THANK YOUNG GONNA CONTINUE WITH THE SECTION -- NINE STUFF YOU JUST SAID THAT. THEY'RE READY IN THE PROCESS OF THEIR READY DEVELOPING A PROCESS AROUND AND THERE WAS IN CONTROL AND SO ARE WE GETTING AHEAD OF THAT WITH THIS BILL WOULD BE MY FIRST QUESTION WHY DO WE NEED TO GET AHEAD OF THAT -- THERE'S SOMETHING OUT THAT'S ALREADY BEING WORKED ON THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER I'D I DON'T BELIEVE WE'RE GETTING OUT AHEAD OF THE REGIONAL BOARDS PROCESS BECAUSE THEY WILL IN REGULATION BRING ABOUT THIS. SAME REQUIREMENT FOR A BROADER SCOPE OF OF POTENTIAL TIMBER HARVESTING OPERATIONS BUT THESE CHANGES IN OUR VIEW NEED TO OCCUR NOW THE REGION FOR THE REGIONAL BOARD IS. DOING GOOD WORK -- BUT I THINK THE LEGISLATURE BY WEIGHING IN HERE AND PRIORITIZING THESE SALMONBERRY WATER COURSES THAT ARE ALREADY IMPAIRED SHOWING THAT PROGRESS CAN MOVE IN A PARTICULAR DIRECTION. WHAT'S THE TIMELINE THAT THEY'RE EXPECTED TO BE DONE WITH THAT ASIS I'M NOT CERTAIN THERE IS AN ESTABLISHED. TIMELINE FOR COMPLETING THE PROCESS [inaudible] AND SO. YOU ALSO MENTIONED THAT SOME OF THESE -- HARVEST PLANS ALREADY HAVE THIS EROSION CONTROL. PART OF THE PLAN IN THERE ALREADY BUT SOME DON'T WHY IS IT THAT SOME DO AND SOME DON'T. I'M NOT. AN EXPERT ON EXACTLY WHAT WHICH THP USER TIMBER HARVESTING PLANS HAVE TO HAVE CERTAIN EROSION CONTROL REQUIREMENTS GENERALLY SPEAKING THERE THEIR SPECIFIC TO THE THE AREA THAT'S ENVISIONED FOR HARVEST OF COURSE THERE ARE THE THREE DIFFERENT KINDS OF TIMBER HARVESTING PLANTS THE THEN TNT'S THE WORKING FORCE MANAGEMENT PLANS. IN THIS TIMBER HARVESTING PLANTS EACH HAVE THEIR OWN -- SPECIFICATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE DIFFERENT REGIONAL BOARDS I'M SURE THE QUESTION WOULD BE TO WRITE ARE ANSWERED BY. THE THE OPPOSITION. YES THANK UP SOME IMPRESSIVE SOLD THE IN TEMPE NON INDUSTRIAL TO MOMENTUM PLANT DOES HAVE. A LOOK AT A RUSSIAN AS WELL BUT IT LOOKS AT IT AS A ONE TIME BASIS IN THE ONE TIME APPROVAL AND LESS THAT LANDOWNER DECIDES TO THEN HARVEST TREES. THEN IT HAS TO GO BACK AND REDO THE PLAN TO CONSIDER EROSION AGAIN BUT IT IT IS LOOKED AT TEACH BILL LOOKED AT ALL THE TIME PERIOD. I THINK OUR CONCERN IS IS THAT T. H. P. ALL TEACH PLEASE HAVE THE RUSSIAN CONTROL PLAN. BUT TEACH PEAS COVER A FEW HUNDRED ACRES FOR GIVEN PROJECT THEY DON'T COVER ALL OF AN OF A LANDOWNER'S PROPERTY. AN NCMP COVERS UP TO TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED ACRES AND A WORKING FOREST MANAGEMENT PLAN COVERS UP TO TEN THOUSAND ACRES. SO YOU WOULD NOT DO AN EROSION CONTROL PLAN TO COVER TEN THOUSAND ACRES IT WOULD BE A MASSIVE UNDERTAKING A LOT OF COSTS WHAT YOU WOULD DO IS AN EROSION CONTROL PLAN. FOR PROJECT WITHIN THE INDIAN P. OR WITHIN THE WFMT AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR WITH IT NEEDS TO BE CHANGES BECAUSE AGAIN. WHAT HAS BEEN DIFFICULT IS HAVING FOLKS THAT ARE EXPERTS IN FORESTRY TELLING US WHAT THE RULES SHOULD BE WHEN THEY DON'T KNOW THE RULES IN THE FIRST PLACE? ASSEMBLYMEMBER ALL OBJECT ON LETTER FINISHED PLEASE SEVEN US QUESTION YET THAT HAS THAT HAS BEEN DIFFICULT FOR US SO WE HAVE TRIED TO PROVIDE. TECHNICAL EXPERTISE ON ON ON THE AMENDMENTS [inaudible] SO. I'VE SEEN THESE THESE PLANS AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT I UNDERSTAND THE MALL BUT I KNOW A LOT OF WORK GOES INTO THEN WE HAVE A LOT OF EACH IS IS INCLUDED IN THERE WE COULD IN THE GEOLOGIST -- THAT THAT YOU'RE OUT THERE AND IT'S A PROCESS THAT WAS CREATED BY HUMANS ARE BY NO MEANS DO I AM I GOING TO BELIEVE THAT IT'S PERFECT. BUT IT SEEMS TO BE YOU KNOW PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE. AND THERE MAY BE A ROOMS THAT NEED TO BE MADE IN THERE BUT I I DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND WHY. WE NEED TO SWITCH WHO IS THE LEAD AGENCY WHERE THE GEOLOGIST HAS. TO HAS TO BE THE ONE TO SIGN OFTEN ALREADY PART OF THE PROCESS AND GET TO HAVE A VOICE AND ARE READY AND SO WHY WE NEED TO CHANGE THOSE RULES. SO YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND ANSWER THAT FOR ME NOW APPRECIATE THE QUESTION ASSEMBLYMEMBER WE WE ARE. ABSOLUTELY WILLING TO TAKE THAT TECHNICAL SUGGESTION FROM THE OPPOSITION IN THEIR LETTER. ABOUT HOW ABOUT THE ROLE THAT THE STATE GEOLOGIST WOULD PLAY IN THIS REVIEW OF LOGGING OPERATIONS ON EXTREME -- OCEAN HAZARD AREAS I MEAN AGAIN THESE ARE THESE ARE THE THE TERM IS. DODD NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BUT THE FACT IS THESE ARE AREAS THAT HAVE AN EXTREME EROSION POTENTIAL IF THE GEOLOGISTS LICENSED BY THE STATE ARE REVIEWING THEM -- THAN THAT CAN BE. PART OF THE PROCESS ENVISIONED BY THIS BILL AND WE'RE PERFECTLY WILLING. TO ADDRESS THAT IN TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS AND NATURI SOURCES SUCH AS THE ANCHOR BECAUSE I'LL I'LL SEE AGAIN AND NATURAL RESOURCES I'VE THIS MAKES IT THERE -- AND I MEAN I I ALSO WANT TO STOP. REFERENCING THEN ASKED TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS BECAUSE WHAT YOU THINK THEIR TECHNICAL I THINK IT MIGHT. MINIMIZE OR SHE REALIZED HOW HOW THE OTHER SIDE IS FILLING ABOUT THESE AMENDMENTS OUT THERE -- BUT JUST TO BE CLEAR YOU YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO REMOVE THE PART THAT SAYS THAT THE G. COLLEGES ARE THE FINAL. SIGN OFF ON ON THESE PLANS. YES AS THE AUTHOR YES. OKAY I THANK YOU UP ABOUT THAT. I WILL SAY THAT YOU KNOW YOU YOU HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS AND THEY HAVE GONE FROM OPPOSED TO OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED I THINK THE OPPOSITION THAT YOU HAVE HERE HAS FOCUS. ON SECTION -- NINE MULTIPLE TIMES IT'S THAT THE PART THAT I'VE BEEN. FOCUSING ON MYSELF AND SO I HOPE THAT WE DO THAT PART AND THEN I HOPE THAT WE FIND A COMPROMISE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE DEFINITION OR TO ALLOW ME TO RUN EXTREMELY RELATION. HACER RATING VERSUS -- WE'RE SAYING THAT WE ALREADY HAVE A REGIONAL BOARD GOING TOWARDS -- I THINK THAT THAT'S THE OTHER OUTSTANDING PIECE THAT'S THAT'S OUT HERE. I TO BE ADDRESS AS AS THIS MOVES FORWARD. I APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE TO WORK AT THIS IN THE COMMITMENT TO THAT AMENDMENT MOVING FORWARD I KNOW THAT ONE TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING BUT I'M GOING TO GIVE. MY SUPPORT TODAY LOOKING FOR THAT AND AND NATURAL RESOURCES ARE ASKING THE OPPOSITION TO KEEP WORKING WITH US TO MAKE SURE WE FIND A COMPROMISE -- MAN THE WORK HAS HAS BEEN MOVING HERE -- AND SO WITH THAT I'LL GO AHEAD AND HANDED OVER TO OUR OFFICE QUESTION THING. AS FOR MATHIS FOLLOWED BY MS FREEMAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- I'D LIKE TO A LINE MY COMMENTS REGARDS TO SECTION NINE WITH MY COLLEAGUES -- AND ALSO I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THE AMENDMENTS MADE AS IT COMES TO NATURAL RESOURCES AND I WILL SEE YOU THERE -- BUT I'M ALSO FEELING THE SENSE OF URGENCY THAT THAT'S BEING STRESS -- BY THE PROPONENTS OF THIS. AND I FIND THAT INTERESTING BECAUSE THERE SEVERAL RECENT NEWS ARTICLES ABOUT HOW WELL THE SALMON INDUSTRIES DOING. SHELL IF. WE'RE BEING TOLD THERE'S THIS THIS URGENCYTO GET THIS DONE. THEN WHY DOES THE PRESS AND AND ACTUALLY COMMENTS. FROM THE PROPONENTS THE YOU GUYS ARE SAYING. YOU HAVE YOUR URINE DIRE STRAITS HERE BUT AS RECENTLY AS LAST YEAR YOU'RE KIND OF BRAGGING ABOUT HOW WELL THE INDUSTRY'S DOING SO. IT'S KIND OF A MIXED SIGNAL. ON HEY WE'VE GOT TO GET THIS DONE IMMEDIATELY THIS IS GOING TO GO FORWARD BUT THE AND I MEAN I I COULD READ. THE SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE ARTICLES ABOUT HOW WELL THE YOU GUYS OF SAID THE SALMON ARE DOING SO. WHAT IS AT OF TERMINUS TO ABOUT IT I THINK HAVING ONE OR? TWO GOOD YEARS DOESN'T. CHANGE THE LONG TERM DECLINE BUT WITH HIS SENATOR THIS OF PRACTICES OF FORESTRY HAVE CHANGED OVER THE DECADES. YOU'RE USING OLD RESEARCH DATA TO SHOW. LEGACY ISSUES EVEN THOUGH THE PRACTICES OF CHANGE SO THE NEW ARTICLES TALKING ABOUT GOOD YEARS OF SALMON. IN REGARDS TO AT THE SAME TIME FOR STRETCHES OF CHANGE. IT IT REALLY MAKES IT INTERESTING TO TO LOU TO PUT IT ALL TOGETHER. WHERE OKAY BEFORE YES THERE WAS ISSUES BEFORE FOR SHE WAS ON A LOT DIFFERENTLY? BEFORE FISHING WAS DONE A LOT DIFFERENTLY SO HERE WE ARE IN TO THEM A MODERN AGE OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. FRESH NEWS ARTICLES OF HOW WALL THE SEVEN HISTORIES DOING AND HERE WE ARE. DEBATING A BILL. TO GET INTO FORESTRY AND CHANGE THINGS AND CHANGE SETTLEMENT EVERYTHING ELSE A LOT OF THIS BILLS. VERY GOOD VERY GERMANE AS VICE CHAIR MENTION FOR IT. THE URGENCY AND THE PUSH OF LIKE HEY LET'S GET THIS DONE NOW. WHEN INTEREST IS DOING WELL RIGHT NOW IS JUST INTERESTING TO SEE? YEAH AND I JUST TO BE CLEAR I DON'T I'VE NEVER SAID ON THE RIVER SUGGESTED THAT. THE TIMBER INDUSTRY IS RESPONSIBLE. FOR THE IS THAT DOCTOR WHAT'S CAUSING TO THE CLIMB THAT'S THE THE DOMINANT OR THE SOLE FACTOR THAT'S CAUSING THE CLIENTS ON THE TO ONE PIECE OF THE PUZZLE BUT I'LL ASK MR OPPENHEIM TO RESPOND. TO IT. THANK YOU SOME OF THE MEMBER FOR THE QUESTION. THE THE WELCOME NEWS YOU POINT. TO IS THAT THE SAME IN INDUSTRY IS BACK FROM THE BRINK WE HAD FEDERALLY DECLARED FISHERY DISASTERS IN 201-622-01720 EIGHTEEN WASN'T SO MUCH BETTER. SO FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A DECADE THIS INDUSTRY IS ABLE TO MAKE THE BOTTOM LINE WORK. I MEAN THAT'S THAT THE FACT THAT THAT'S A VICTORY WORTHY OF THE FRONT PAGE OF THE SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE. IS AN ASTONISHINGLY TELLING SIGN OF HOW COMPROMISE THE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN. SO WE'RE BACK AND FISHERMEN ARE ABLE TO PAY THE BILLS THEY WERE SHUT DOWN OUT OF THE CRAB FISHERY FOR THREE MONTHS THIS SPRING. SO WE WERE CELEBRATING BECAUSE OUR MEMBERS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO SELL THEIR BOOKS. THE SALMON FISHERY IS BENEFITING FROM PRECIPITATION IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN SPRING SEASON THAT MOOD FISHER THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE'RE STILL FISHING ON QUOTAS IN THE KLAMATH MANAGEMENT'S OUT WE STILL OF HIS OWN AROUND THAT YOU RIVER THAT IS CLOSE IT'S BEEN CLOSED FOR DECADES. SO WE WE HAVE BENEFITS COMING FROM. NATURE'S BOUNTY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND LUCKILY HATCHERY REFORMS THAT ALLOWED US TO MOVE FISH OUT OF THOSE COMPROMISED STREAMS AWAY FROM THOSE CREDIT PREDATION GAUNTLETS BUT YOUR COLLEAGUE WAS SPEAKING ABOUT EARLIER. THERE ARE STILL PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE YOU CAN'T CATCH FISH THERE ARE STILL PARTS OF THE STATE WERE GUIDES RECREATIONAL ANGLERS AND COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN. ARE RESTRICTED. TO THE POINT WHERE IT'S NOT EVEN WORTH BUYING DIESEL TO GO OUT OPEN THE NORTH COAST WHERE MOST OF THESE COMPROMISEDSENTIMENT IMPAIRED WATER COURSES ARE THERE ARE STILL PROBLEMS WE HAVE TO ADDRESS. AND WE CAN CELEBRATE THE FACT THAT YOU CAN GO OUT AND BUY SENATE FOR TWENTY DOLLARS A POUND SO THE FORTY BUT WE'RE STILL STRUGGLING AND THIS BILL IS GOING TO DO A LOT MORE TO THAT NOTE EVERY INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA STRUCK BECAUSE IT'S CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE OVER. INDULGENT ON WHAT THE STATE DOES TO OUR INDUSTRIES. SOUND THAT'S NOT PART OF THIS CONVERSATION -- ALSO I'M GONNA ASK YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD SEVERAL WILDFIRES. THAT I'VE. COMPLETELY IMPACTED -- THINGS AND HAD MUD SLIDES AND EVERYTHING ELSE TO DO WITH THOSE ARE YOU GUYS LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS AND WITH THAT BECAUSE I MEAN I KNOW. ON THE FORESTRY SIDE IN FOR SURE MANAGEMENT AND EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED WITH WHAT THEY'RE DOING. THEY'RE LOOKING AT HOW. TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THE FOREST FIRES AND KEEP THOSE THINGS DOWN. AND THE AREAS -- YOU KNOW YOU LOOK DOWN SOUTH AND YOU CAN SEE WHERE WE HAD A FORCE FIRE FOLLOWED BY A MUD SLIDE. SO I MEAN ARE WE LOOKING AT THOSE IMPACTS AS WELL BECAUSE I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT FULLY ADDRESSED IN THE LEGISLATION THERE ARE. MANY FACTORS. RIGHT AND AND ADDRESSING ONE FACTOR. DOESN'T MEAN THAT THERE ARE AND OTHER FACTORS -- AND YOU KNOW THAT THIS BILL AT LEAST EARLY ON ONE OF ONE OF THE COMMENTERS WHAT THE BILL IS THERE IS THERE A LOT OF ASPECTS TO THE BILL'S BEEN NARROWED SIGNIFICANTLY. US ARE NOT GOING TO SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM IN ONE BILL -- BUT I KNOW THAT WE ARE ALL UNANIMOUSLY COMMITTED -- TO TRYING TO ADDRESS THOSE PARTICULAR ISSUES IN THOSE DISASTERS BUT BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THIS ISN'T ALSO A FACTOR. OKAY. AND AND CENTER I'M I'M JUST GONNA GO AND ASK THE THE QUESTION I THINKS OUT THERE ARE YOU WILLING TO TAKE. AMENDMENTS IN REGARDS TO SECTION NINE OF YOUR BILL. I I THINK I ANSWERED THAT TO SOME MEMBER. CARDS AYE AYE SIR NOW ADDICTED I SAID WE WOULD TAKE THAT AMOUNT AND WE TALKED TO HER ABOUT. THANK YOU.

ON THAT WILL AFFECT -- A LOT OF TRIBUTARIES AND THINGS THAT ARE SALMON BEARING UP AND DOWN UP AND DOWN THE SACRAMENTO RIVER -- NOT MISTER THE FOCUS OF OF THE CONVERSATION HERE TODAY BUT JUST ANOTHER ILLUSTRATION OF SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WE FACE SO I APPRECIATE YOUR WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION AND OTHER. SUPPORT TODAY ON THAT BASIS THANK YOU. THE DOCTOR ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM ANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS YOU HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND WAS NIELSEN AND YOU ALSO A JOY. TO PASS AS AMENDED RECOMMEND NATION IT'S A GOOD START AND I'LL BE BRIEF -- I DO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS MOST OF THE MORE TECHNICAL ONE DOES RELATE TO ALLOWING TO COUNTIES TO BAND TOGETHER AND PINE FOR THESE MONIES. THESE MONIES ARE CONTINGENT ON APPROPRIATION OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THEY WOULD BE FOR WATERSHED RESTORATION IN THE AFFECTED COUNTIES FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND AFTER. A WHILE I WON'T BELABOR IT BUT LET'S JUST SAY THAT THERE'S A DEVASTATING IMPACT THAT LAST ON THESE. FOREST IN WILD LANDS AND EVEN THE URBAN INTERFACE LANDS THAT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED. IN SOME CASES THE FIRES SO HOT THAT IT LITERALLY STERILIZERS THE LAND. IT CERTAINLY AFFECTS HABITAT. BOTH AB IN AND AND AND WATER. FISH FOR EXAMPLE. AND WE NEED TO GET BACK AND TRY TO RESTORE AND IN SOME CASES THIS WILL REQUIRE I BELIEVE SOME RE PLANT. BUT WE DO NOT HAVE ANY RESOURCES TO DO THAT THIS IS AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL WE WOULD ASK YOUR INDULGENCE FOR THE YES VOTE. WELL YOU HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND -- THOSE OF SPEAKING IN FAVOR OF THE A MEASURE PLEASE COME FORWARD. YOUR SINGLE PICKY WITH THE CALIFORNIA FORESTRY ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. OF A YOU A STUDY FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN BY THE U. U. S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY SHOW THAT WHILE FIRES HAVE THE ABILITY TO DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF SETTLEMENT. IN A THIRD OF THE LARGEST WESTERN WATERSHEDS BY. TWENTY FIFTY IN SOME AREAS SEVEN IT COULD INCREASE BY A 1000% POTENTIALLY CARRYING PARASITES AND HARMFUL METALS AND CHEMICALS WITH IT FOR THOSE REASONS WE SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU.

THAT WILL HELP -- YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE EXPERIENCED SOME DEVASTATING FIRE. FIRES AS WE ALL KNOW. IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE AND YOU KNOW KIND OF HARKENING BACK TO OUR PREVIOUS DISCUSSION THIS IS ONE OF THE BIGGER SOURCES OF WERE SEEN EROSION AND SEDIMENT GETTING INTO OUR RIVER SYSTEMS. IN THE AFTERMATH OF THESE DEVASTATING FIRES AND SO. ONE WE NEED TO DO THIS IN TERMS OF ENSURING THAT WE HAVE SOME. SOME FUNDING TO DO RESTORATION WORK -- YOU KNOW IN THESE AREAS WHERE WE'VE HAD THAT -- DEVASTATING WILD WILDFIRE. IN ALSO TRY AND DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PREVENT AND YES SENATORS BEEN. IN A BIG ADVOCATE FOR THAT AS WELL HOW WE PREVENT AS WE NEED GREATER FORESTRY MANAGEMENT -- YOU KNOW THROUGHOUT THROUGHOUT OUR FORCED IT LANDS WERE DOING SOME OF THAT WORK AND BUT WE SHOULD NOT DO IS IS. PROVIDED A A AN ADDITIONAL IMPEDIMENT TO DOING SOME OF THAT -- MATCHING IN FORESTRY MANAGEMENT WORK SO THANK THE SENATOR ASKED.

CRISTINA GARCIA CRISTINA GARCIA I GLORIA. KALRA. LEVINE. LEVINE AYE MATHIS. MATHIS I TALK A RUBIO. BLANCA RUBIO HIGH SALAS WOOD DETERMINE THANK YOU MEMBERS. SB THREE NINETY FIVE CENTER ARE TO LET. YOU HAVE A DO PASSED WITH COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND PLEASE BEGIN. MOVE THE BILL AS AMENDED. MOTION SIR BIGELOW. THE SECOND WAS SLOWING SO WITH THIS BILL [inaudible] NO NO. WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE FLOOR. AND A SECOND BY DOCTOR JOE. TO CONTINUE. THANK YOU THANK YOU A GERMAN GARCIA AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I THANK YOU. FOR TAKING THIS TIME OUT FOR ME TODAY I WOULD LIKE TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THIS BILL. AND I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS -- THIS BILL SB THREE NINETY FIVE KNOWN AS THE WILDLIFE TRAFFIC SAFETY ACT REQUIRES FISH AND GAME COMMISSION TO DEVELOP A PILOT PROGRAM. TO PERMIT THE SALVAGE OF CERTAIN LARGE GAME MAMMALS KILLED BY A VEHICLE COLLISIONS. AND REQUIRES A DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILD WILDLIFE TO COLLECT COMPILE AND MAKE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC THE REPORTING OF DATA. OF WILDLIFE VEHICLE COLLISIONS. EACH YEAR IT IS ESTIMATED THAT OVER TWENTY THOUSAND DEAR ALONE ARE KILLED ON CALIFORNIA ROADWAYS. EVEN MORE ALARMING ACCORDING TO THE DATA GATHERED BY THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL. OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS APPROXIMATELY EIGHT THOUSAND LARGE GAME ANIMAL COLLISIONS HAVE CONSUMER HAVE RESULTED IN FIFTEEN HUNDRED INJURIES. AND AT LEAST TWENTY FOUR FATALITIES TO MOTORISTS AND PASSENGERS ALIKE. THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE. AND MORE DATA IS NEEDED TO CREATE SAFER LARGE GAME ANIMALS COLLISION A CALIFORNIA ARE MULTI FACETED PROBLEM THAT CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA HAS NO RESPONSE TO MITIGATE THESE AVOIDABLE THREATS TO OUR PUBLIC SAFETY. FOR ONE THERE IS NO MECHANISM TO TRACK OR MAP HISTORICALLY DANGEROUS AREAS. WE KNOW THAT THEIR THAT THESE AREAS DO EXIST IN THE STATE WERE MOTORIST AND LARGE GAME ANIMALS SPECIFICALLY DEER ELK ANTELOPE. ARE MORE LIKELY TO COME INTO CONTACT. BUT WE DO NOT HAVE ACTIONABLE DATA TO CHANGE THE OUTCOMES SECONDLY. CALIFORNIA FISH AND GAME CODE SECTION. TWO THOUSAND THREE POINT FIVE PROHIBITS INDIVIDUALS FROM REMOVING ANIMALS OUT OF THE ROADWAY BECAUSE OF THIS. ANIMALS ARE USUALLY LEFT IN THE ROAD. AFTER THE COLLISION THIS IN TURN LEADS TO A SECONDARY HAZARD AND MORE COLLISIONS. NOT TO MENTION THE ADDED COST TO CALTRANS TO EVENTUALLY CLEAN UP THE ROAD BECAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT. BY MARRYING THAT LEGISLATION THAT IS ALREADY IN PLACE IN MANY STATES INCLUDING IDAHO MONTANA OREGON WASHINGTON. SENATE BILL THREE NINETY FIVE WILL ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS. SENATE BILL THREE NINETY FIVE WILL REQUIRE THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION. TO DEVELOP A WEB BASED PORTAL. THAT WOULD ALLOW USERS TO LOG INFORMATION IN REGARDS TO LARGE GAME MEMEL COLLISIONS AT THE SAME TIME DELIVER PERMITS FOR THE TAKE OF THESE LARGE GAME AND MAMMALS. CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED IN PREVIOUS COMMITTEES AND AND I'M SURE YOU HAVE THE SAME QUESTION ABOUT ALLOWING MOTORISTS TO DISPATCH. INJURED ANIMALS ON THE ROADWAY. WITH THE HELP OF THE WATER PARKS AND AND WILDLIFE COMMITTEE WE HAVE AMENDED THIS PROVISION OUT OF THE BILL. RECENT AMENDMENTS ALSO GIVE MORE FLEXIBILITY FOR THE COMMISSION TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE THE GEOGRAPHICAL SIZE OF THE PILOT PROGRAM. THAT IS SB THREE NINETY FIVE AND ONCE AGAIN I EMPHASIZE A PILOT PROGRAM THAT IS. THREE NINETY FIVE THIS BILL WILL IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY ON OUR ROADWAYS AND SAVE THOUSANDS OF DEER AND WILDLIFE. FOR ROAD RELATED DEATHS IN THE FUTURE. THIS BILL HAD RECEIVED NO VOTES NO NO VOTE HAS NO KNOWN OPPOSITION. FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND WITH ME TODAY. I HAVE -- DOCTOR FRAZIER CHILLING FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLICY AT UC DAVIS. AND BILL GAINES REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA DEAR ASSOCIATION TO ANSWERING TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE REGARD TO THIS BILL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR PLEASE. CLOSE THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME. TO TESTIFY HERE TODAY -- I AM PHASES SHOWING AT DEPARTMENT OF ART AND SCIENCE OF POLICY UC DAVIS I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE ROAD ECOLOGY CENTER EASY DAVIS -- WE STUDY ROAD IMPACTS -- ON NATURE WILDLIFE ECOLOGY -- ALSO THE ORGANIZER FOR THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE A CONFERENCE ON ECOLOGY AND TRANSPORTATION WHICH IS THE PRIMARY CONFERENCE IN THIS FIELD -- IN THE WORLD. AND WE HAVE THE LARGEST LONGEST RUNNING WILDLIFE AND CRASH REPORTING SYSTEM IN THE U. S. THAT'S BEEN GOING FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS. AND WE'VE COLLECTED ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND RECORDS IN CALIFORNIA -- WALLET VEHICLE COLLISIONS. THE MONTH WE GET DATA REQUESTS FROM CALTRANS COOK CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT FISH AND WILDLIFE -- OTHER AGENCIES AND CONSULTANTS WHO ARE PLANNING FOR WILDLIFE A VEHICLE COLLISION MITIGATION TO PROTECT DRIVER SAFETY AND TO PROTECT WILDLIFE. STATE FARM INSURANCE ESTIMATES THAT THERE ABOUT. TWENTY THREE THOUSAND COLLISIONS WITH DEAR PER YEAR THE RESULT IN A CLAIM. IN OTHER STATES. ONLY ONE IN FOUR CLAIMS ARE ACTUALLY REPORTED AB. SO THEIR ESTIMATES FOR MOST OTHER STATES IS THAT IF YOU HAVE. TWENTY TO THIRTY THOUSAND CLAIMS YOU'VE GOT ABOUT EIGHTY TO A HUNDRED THOUSAND ACTUAL COLLISIONS BECAUSE NOT ALL COLLISIONS ARE REPORTED. MEANING THAT WE HAVE ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND DEAD DEER PER YEAR ON THE ROADWAYS IN CALIFORNIA. OUR WALLET VEHICLE COLLISION CRASH REPORTING SYSTEM RUN THROUGH A WEB PORTAL CAN BE USED ON A SMARTPHONE OR TABLET A DESKTOP -- COULD BE MODIFIED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THIS ACT. IF IF -- THE STATE WANTED TO CHOOSE A LOWER COST OPTION THAN THAN INVENTING A NEW SYSTEM -- AND IT ALSO WOULD ALLOW THE REPORTING OUT OF THESE DATA TO BE CONTINUOUSLY USED IN AUTOMATICALLY USED BY RESPONSIBLE AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA. OUR SYSTEM BECAUSE IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR A WHILE IT'S HELPED INFORM THE DEVELOPMENT OF SIMILAR SYSTEMS AND OTHER STATES INCLUDING IDAHO'S. AND NOW WE'RE IN A POSITION TO BORROW FROM THEIR SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS TO COMBINE COLLECTING MORE DATA ABOUT WHILE LIKE VEHICLE COLLISIONS. AND ALLOWING PEOPLE TO LEGALLY -- RECOVER MADE FROM THE CARCASSES FROM THOSE CRASHES [inaudible] THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BILL GAINES THAT REPRESENT CALIFORNIA DEAR ASSOCIATION ON THIS ISSUE THAT THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL. ONE IN SIXTEEN CAR ACCIDENTS IN CALIFORNIA INVOLVE WILDLIFE. YOU HEARD THAT THE SENATOR MENTIONED THAT -- FIFTEEN THOUSAND FIFTEEN HUNDRED ACCIDENTS THE CLAIM TWENTY FOUR LIVES HERE CALIFORNIA IN THE LAST SIX YEARS WELL CORNY CH BEING THE LAST TWO YEARS ALONE THERE'S BEEN. ABOUT TWELVE PEOPLE KILLED IN OUR STATE WITH COLLISIONS WITH BIG GAME ANIMALS. THESE ARE AVOIDABLE THREATS TO THE SAFETY OF OUR PUBLIC AND TO THE LONG TERM HEALTH OF OUR WILDLIFE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THEY ARE AVOIDABLE. SENATE BILL THREE NINETY FIVE WOULD ADDRESS THESE RISKS IN SEVERAL WAYS FIRST OF ALL WOULD REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND GAME TO CREATE A CELLPHONE FRIENDLY APP SIMILAR TO THE WAY ZAP THAT ANY OF YOU PROBABLY HAVE ON YOUR PHONE NOW TO REPORTING ACCIDENTS IN VARIOUS PROBLEMS ON THE ROADWAYS. A SIMILAR ACT WOULD MAKE IT EASY FOR CALIFORNIA'S MOTORISTS REPORT WHERE THESE ACCIDENTS WITH BIG GAME ARE HAPPENING. THE DATA IS THE BIG THING THAT WE NEED TO PREVENT FUTURE ACCIDENTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WITH THIS DATA AGENCIES CAN PARTNER WITH ENTITIES LIKE YOU KNOW THERE SIR CALIFORNIA DAVIS THE BETTER PREDICT ROADKILL HOT SPOT. AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO EVALUATE THE PLACEMENT OF FUTURE WILDLIFE CROSSINGS AND OTHER. ACTIONS THAT CAN REDUCE FUTURE ACCIDENTS AND PROMOTE PUBLIC SAFETY. OVER THE LONG TERM TO ENCOURAGE REPORTING SENATE BILL THREE NINETY FIVE ALSO WOULD ALLOW. THE SALVAGE OF BIG GAME ANIMALS INCLUDING DEER ELK ANTELOPE AND WILD PIG. FOR PERSONAL HUMAN CONSUMPTION. THE ISSUE APPROACHING THE OTHER STATES IDAHO OREGON WASHINGTON AND MONTANA. WHO HAVE PROGRAMS ALREADY IN PLACE I HAVE SEEN NO NOTABLE INCREASE IN POACHING AS A RESULT OF SIMILAR PROGRAMS THAT ARE CURRENTLY UNDER WAY IN THEIR STATES? SYMBOL THREE NINETY FIVE WOULD IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY AND PROTECT OUR WILDLIFE OVER THE LONG TERM. IT WOULD STOP THE NEEDLESS WASTE OF LARGE ANIMALS KILLED ON OUR ROADWAYS BY ALLOWING THE SALVAGE OF WILD GAME MEAT FOR THOSE IN NEED OR FOR THOSE WHO SIMPLY ENJOY HEALTHY FREE RANGE ORGANIC FOOD SOURCES IN BASEBALL THOSE REASONS I RETURN AYE VOTE TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE WISHING TO SPEAK IN FAVOR THIS MEASURE. PLEASE COME FORWARD. CHIU NAME AN ORGANIZATION. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MARKEDLY WITH CALIFORNIA WATERFOWL ALSO REFEREED REPRESENTING THE CALOR WETLANDS AND WATERFOWL KENNEL COUNCIL. AS WELL AS THE TULARE BASIN WETLANDS ASSOCIATION AND WE DO SUPPORT THE BILL WE CONTINUE TO ALSO URGED THE AUTHOR TO CONSIDER ADDING OTHER SPECIES TO THE LIST -- THE STATE OF IDAHO WAS MENTIONED EARLIER THEY HAVE ABOUT FORTY PLUS SPECIES ON THEIR LIST SO THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN ROY GROUP OF REPRESENT A CALIFORNIA RIFLE PISTOL ASSOCIATION DAY OFF REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER WELL CHEAP FILM FOUNDATION CONGRESSIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS FOUNDATION IN THE ROCKING ON ELK FOUNDATION ALL STRONG SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THOSE WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE MEASURE. SEE NO ONE WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND TOPPING BACK FOR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SENATOR -- FOR FOR THIS BILL THAT YOU KNOW IS IT. INTERESTING BUT ALL IT IT'S DEALING WITH A REAL ISSUE I'VE GOT MY OWN CONCERNS ABOUT IT THAT I'VE I'VE SHARED WITH YOUR YOUR STAFF -- I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU'RE PUTTING INTO IT I THINK THAT WE KNOW THAT APPS -- ARE OUT THERE THAT MAKE IT EASY TO REPORT THINGS HAPPEN ON THE ROADWAY. YOU KNOW SAID ON WAYS AND THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER WAYS TO DO THAT AND AND SO I THINK THIS IS A POSITIVE THING BECAUSE WE DO WANT TO KNOW WHERE ANIMALS ARE BEING HIT -- TO TO HELP WITH WILDLIFE CROSSINGS AND AND WILDLIFE CORRIDORS WHICH I CARE A GREAT DEAL ABOUT -- I DO SHARE THE CONCERNS ABOUT -- WHETHER THIS INCENTIVIZE IS ANY TYPE OF BEHAVIOR I KNOW THAT YOU'VE STATED -- IN OTHER STATES THAT HASN'T BEEN. A PROBLEM -- BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT A TAKING IS NECESSARY FOR DOING THE REPORTING. AND I THINK THAT THE REPORTING CAN ALSO MAKE SURE THAT THE ANIMAL IS SAFELY -- TAKEN FROM WHEREVER IT'S BEEN HIT -- AND ALSO COULD BE -- IF IT IS MORTALLY WOUNDED -- MAYBE COULD GET BETTER CARE OR TREATMENT WHILE IT TODD. EITHER CONVALESCENCE OR OR DOES NOT -- IF IT'S DONE BY BY PROFESSIONALS -- AND ALSO MAYBE EVEN SAFER FOR PEOPLE ON THE ROADWAY WHO WOULD BE SPENDING TIME -- DID YOU KNOW TAKING THAT ANIMALS SO I THE I GOT THOSE CONCERNS -- LIKELY WILL VOTE NO TODAY I WILL KEEP AN OPEN MIND AS IT COMES TO THE FLOOR AS IS CHANGES ARE MADE OF MORE INFORMATION COMES TO ME THAT TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION -- AND I DO RESPECT THAT THE WORKING APPROACH THAT YOU'RE TAKING TO THAT THIS ISSUE IF I DON'T END UP ON EXACT SAME PLACE THAT THAT YOU DO. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND THAT'S ALL I CAN ASK OF I KNOW THAT -- STAFFERS IS TALK WITH YOUR OFFICE AND I APPRECIATE THE TIME YOU'VE GIVEN GIVEN TO US -- MY LAW ENFORCEMENT BACKGROUND HAD BROUGHT ME TO THIS BILL EOPLE VAST HOW I GOT INVOLVED IN BECAUSE OF MY LAW ENFORCEMENT BACKGROUND SHERMAN WITH THE MOTHER ABOUT POLICE DEPARTMENT. AND I SAW THIS IS A IS A PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE AND THEN IT INVOLVED IN AS I GOT DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO IT AND MET WITH A FISH WILDLIFE AND MET WITH THE MEMBERS THE COMMISSION AND AND AND I REALIZED THAT -- IN SPEAKING WITH THE HIGHWAY PATROL AND SO. ONE THAT IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THIS BILL GO FORWARD BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT SO MANY PEOPLE ARE KILLED OUR HIGHWAYS AND I CAN IMAGINE. OF A VAN FULL OF OF KIDS IN THE FAMILY IN AND OUT JUMP TO DEAR AND IT GOES OFF THE HIGHWAY AND DOWN THE ROADWAY -- ANY COULD ABORT BEEN AVOIDED PERHAPS WITH SIGNAGE IT COULD'VE BEEN AVOIDED WITH THE LIGHTING IT COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED WITH EVEN EVEN A AN ALERT ON A RADIO -- SOME WAY TO ALERT THE FAMILIES AND AS YOU KNOW WE'RE APPROACHING THE FOURTH OF JULY AND AND FAMILIES TO BE OUT. IN AND OUT IN THE WILDERNESS AREA SO IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS A PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE -- BUT ALONG WITH THAT WE FIND THAT -- THERE'S REASON TO TO TAKE IN AND TO FEED A LOT OF HOMELESS PEOPLE OUT THERE AND IT'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL OUR RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT. FAMILY AFTER FAMILY -- IT'S BEEN PROVIDED FOOD THAT THEY WOULD NORMALLY HAVE SO THAT SHE ISSUE THE OTHER THING THAT THAT I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT AND I'M SURE YOU ARE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBERS POACHING. THAT IS AGAINST THE LAW THIS BILL ADDRESSED THAT BECAUSE THE COMMISSION THEMSELVES WILL BE ABLE TO PIGGY BACK ON THIS THING AND MAKE SURE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN. SO THE LARGER THERE SO WE TRY TO GET ALL THE ELEMENTS THAT THAT -- OPPOSITIONS BROUGHT THAT'S WHY WE WORK WITH THE THE AMENDMENTS AND SO ON AND SO I'M HOPING IN THE FUTURE WHEN IT DOES I HIT THE FLOOR YOU'LL YOU'LL BE WITH THAT ON ON THE ON THAT. AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S A SINGLE BILL OUT THERE THAT'S PERFECT BECAUSE THERE ARE CERTAIN ELEMENTS THAT ARE PLUS A COUPLE OF THAT OUR MINUS. AND WHEN THE PLUS OUTWEIGH AND THAT FOR YOUR VOTE COMES ACROSS AND I APPRECIATE THAT. THANK YOU WE HAVE A DOCTOR YOU HAVE QUESTION FOLLOWED BY MY QUESTION. THANK YOU CHAIR AND THE THING SENATOR I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL -- BUT I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS NUMBER ONE IS THAT THE WHEN THE THE ANYMORE SO -- HIT. CAN BE SALVAGED BY. UP. THE A MORE TO RESTORE ANYBODY ELSE WHO HAPPENED. TO DISCOVER WHAT THE THE THE THE ISSUE IMAGINED THE HACKED AND TAKES PLACE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT BEEN HAPPENING IN THE PAST. IS THE TRAFFIC BACKS UP TO GET IS AGAINST THE LAW FOR YOU TO GET OUT OF YOUR CAR YEAH IN DRAG THE ANIMAL ACROSS THE ROAD WHEN THERE'S TRAFFIC COMING ON BOTH SIDES YES THAT IS AGAINST THE LAW I WROTE SAID THAT. OF FISH AND WILDLIFE IS SAID IT AND EVERYONE KNOWS THAT SO -- THAT'S WHY -- IF WE CAN AVERT THE ACTION WOULD BE PROACTIVE HERE SO IF THE CITED WAS THERE IN ULTIMATELY THIS IS THE GOAL THIS IS THE GOAL. TO GATHER ENOUGH DATA SO WE CAN CREATE A BRIDGE WAY SO IF WE KNOW THAT THIS HERDS OF DEER AND ELK WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE. YOU CAN IMAGINE A V. SHAPED -- FENCING THAT WILL TAKE THAT THE ANIMALS OVER THE THE ROADWAY AND ON TO THE OTHER SIDE. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS MONEY WE HAVE A TAPPED INTO IT TO CREATE THAT BRIDGE WAY AND SO WITH THE DATA THE INFORMATION WE COULD SAY SPECIFICALLY. THIS IS WHERE IT'S HAPPENING AND EVENTUALLY WE COULD HAVE THESE BRIDGE WAYS ACROSS THE STATE -- WHICH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL HELP FINANCE AND IT DOESN'T AFFECT US BECAUSE IT IS PUBLIC SAFETY AND IT'S HAZARDOUS AND SO THAT'S WHY CALTRANS HIGH WITH THE TROUT EVERYBODY'S ON BOARD WITH THIS. AND WE'RE GOING TO AVOID A LOT OF FATALITIES AND A LOT OF INJURIES WITH THIS. YES. I DO REALIZE THAT THAT THE VALUE OF THE DATA THAT THE LOCATION AND ALL KIND OF BY ANIMALS AS A TRUST SO SO THAT YOU CAN. CREATE -- HIGH -- EXTEND EXTENT AREAS -- CAM THE CONSIDERED DUFFEL WAR GREETINGS AND SUCH -- CROSSED ROLLED WHAT PAST PASSAGEWAY FOR THE ANIMALS -- HOWEVER I'M SPEAKING NOW WHY HERE THAT THE IT IS ILLEGAL FOR THE MORE THERE IS TO GET OUT AND TRY TO MOVE US ALL I WOULD NOT BE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THE IF I HIT IT. IN ALL. BLOODY THING -- IRAQ KERRY SO THAT'S WHY WHO SCHOOL NOSTALGIE THAT ANYMORE AND THE COMMITTEE TO EAT. ON SOME WILL CONSUME WELL IT IMMEDIATE -- WOULD HAPPEN IT'D GO TO YOUR CELLPHONE REPORT THE COLLISION CALTRANS ALERTED HIGH WITH CHOCOLATE AND ALERTED FACIAL WELL GAME OF THE GAME'S ALERTED. AND THEY WOULD COME OUT AND AND THEY WOULD TAKE THE THE REMAINS -- FOR FOR THE CHARITABLE CITED IN FEEDING FAB CASTLE FIGHT HAS BEEN IT WAS SELF PROHIBITED THAT KIND OF ACTION WAS -- NOT ALLOW THAT IS CORRECT I SEE OKAY NOW SECOND QUESTION IS THAT THE UP WITH THE A POTENTIAL -- DATA. WITH THE LIMITED THE ABILITY WITH THE NO FOUR ON ALL WHILE -- DEAL ONE NIGHT REPORTING MECHANISM MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT THE US FLOOR WHILE LAST AND ACCURATE THE HOWEVER -- THROUGH ROOMREMOVE ALL OF THOSE SO NOT ANYMORE SO -- HIGHWAY PATROL WAR WOULD OF HAD THE ALREADY. OUR INFORMATION OF WHERE THOSE ACCIDENTS SO. I'M MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE HUMAN -- OF FATALITIES WHEN THEY HIT THE ANIMALS SO IGHT IN ALL THE YOU MENTIONED THAT OF TAR PAPER WILL KILL THE IN A YEAR IS THAT THE TOTAL NUMBER NAM NUMBER OF A WAS SELF FOR ITO ONE MONTH THOUGH. OUR REPORT WAS OVER OAK SHOVEL YEARS BUT ONE TO TELL IS ONE TOO MANY. YES -- ARE AND AND THEN ON WHY NOT -- IF WE A NEW WE DIDN'T HAVE THE DATA WE DIDN'T HAVE THE SYSTEM THE COMMISSION DIDN'T HAVE THE INFORMATION WE DIDN'T HAVE THE BILL. SO NOW WE GO FORWARD WITH THIS AND THIS IS BEING PROACTIVE IN A LOT OF A LOT OF RESPONSES BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THE THE BILL WILL OPEN UP THE DOOR. TO BRING AWARENESS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO THIS TYPE OF FIDELITY AND I'VE GOTTEN A LOT OF CALLS FROM MY DISTRICT WHICH IS IN THE GREATER LOS ANGELES ORANGE COUNTY AREA. THEY ASKED AGAIN WHY DID I GET INVOLVED I GO BACK TO PUBLIC SAFETY BUT THE RESEARCH SHOWS AND AND THIS PILOT PROGRAM BY THE WAY IT'S GONNA TOUCH SOME OF THE AFFECTED AREAS OF CALIFORNIA MORE SO. THAN THE CITIES OF LOS ANGELES AND SO ON BUT SO IT'S NOT ACROSS THE STATE TO THE COMMISSION WILL BE ABLE TO CHOOSE. THE AREAS WHERE THEY'VE HAD DATA FROM THE PAST AND AND GO ON TOP OF THAT. SO THIS WAY IT'LL BE EFFECTIVE IT WILL BE UPDATED AND THE OTHER THING ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEMBER IT -- BRINGS A COMMUNICATIONS CLOSER TOGETHER SO THEN WHEN THAT ONE CALL GOES OUT IT AFFECTS EVERYONE AND TO EVERYONE WILL BE ACTING QUICKLY. OKAY HELLO MY FINAL QUESTION IS THAT THE IN THE STATE SO WHERE ARE THEY HAVE ALREADY COLLECTED THE DATA AND UP. TO A AND MORE ARE COSTING COOLEY BRIDGES AND THE SO THAT WOULD REQUIRE A LOT ABOUT FENCING AROUND US SO THAT THE ONLY PASSAGE WAY SO. YOU KNOW THEY FIND THAT THEY MAKE CROSS SO -- DO YOU KNOW THROUGH THE ANIMAL BEHAVIOR WITH A DOSE OF BREACHES SO -- ACROSS WASTE WERE SUCCESSFULLY USED BY THE ANYMORE. BUT WITH YOUR INDULGENCE I'LL ANSWER THAT. AND THAT IS A IT IS A VERY SUCCESSFUL MITIGATION APPROACH IS TO BUILD LAND BRIDGES WILDLIFE OVER CROSSINGS THEY COME WITH DIFFERENT NAMES. ARE THE FIRST ONE WAS BUILT IN CALIFORNIA IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LAST OCTOBER -- VERY MUCH UNDER THE RADAR BUT THERE'S SO FAR THERE'S NO BIG ONE OVER A HIGHWAY BUT IN OTHER WESTERN STATES ACTUALLY A PRETTY MUCH EVERY OTHER WESTERN STATE. SET MAYBE ORGAN THERE ARE WILDLIFE OVER CROSSINGS BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY EFFECTIVE FROM A WHILE LIKE BEHAVIOR POINT OF VIEW SO THERE THEY DO WORK THANK YOU. IF I MAY ASK -- MISTER BILL GATES TO ALSO CUT THAT PLEASE. WHAT SPECIFICALLY ON ON WHAT DOCTOR FRAZIER WAS COMMENTING ON BUT -- YOU KNOW ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE WITH THE AGENCIES CALTRANS C. H. B. AND OTHERS THAT MAY BE PICKING UP THESEANIMALS AND I WAS THERE NOT REQUIRED REPORT AND OFTEN THEY DON'T REPORT ON WHERE THOSE COLLISIONS ARE TAKING PLACE. THIS BILL WILL HELP FIX THAT BY REQUIRING AGENCIES THAT IF THERE ARE THE ONES TO PICK UP THE ANIMAL THE REPORT. FROM WHERE THOSE SPOTS A RAT AS WELL SO AND IT WOULD ALLOW EITHER THE THE THE MOTORIST THAT STRUCK THE ANIMAL. IF IT'S SAFE FOR HIM OR HER TO GO OUT AND AND TO SALVAGE AT ANIMAL ALLOW THEM TO BUT THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE THE ONE THAT STRUCK IT IF THERE'S A A A A OF FRESH ADAM ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD THAT THAT ANOTHER MOTORIST COMES ACROSS. YOU KNOW THEY CAN GO AHEAD AND SALAS AT ANIMALS WELL OF COURSE BUT THEY HAVE TO GET THE PERMITS WHICH IS WHERE WE GET THE DATA. RIGHT. WE HAVE QUESTION FROM US SOME MEMBERSHIP. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE FOCUS ON THE PUBLIC SAFETY AND TRYING TO IDENTIFY HOT SPOTS WHERE WE MIGHT. SEE A SPIKE IN THESE ACCIDENTS -- MUCH IS THE ANIMAL LIFE THAT WE'RE LOSING BUT THE HUMAN LIFE WE HAVE AN ELK AND A CAR COLLIDED TO PRETTY BAD SITUATION THE OUT THERE. OFTENTIMES. IN SO BUT THIS BILL GOES BE ON COLLECTING DATA AND I THINK THAT THAT PIECE AND HAVING THE AGENCY SPEAK TO EACH OTHER IS. AN IMPORTANT PIECE BUT THAT INCLUDES THE TAKE PART THERE WHICH I HAVE. CONCERNS WITH AS WELL AS SIMILAR TO WHAT MY COLLEAGUE HAS ITERATED EARLIER AND SO WHY ARE WE NOT LIMITING THIS BILL TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY PART OF THE DATA. ON AND THE AGENCY SPEAKING TO EACH OTHER I AND WHERE WE INCLUDING THAT THE TAKE IN HERE AND I'VE NO I'VE HEARD THAT CHARITABLE. DISCUSSION COME IN HERE BUT THAT THAT'S NOT SUFFICE TO ME THERE'S LOTS OF OTHER WAYS I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE HOUSING THE HOMELESS AND HELPING TO TAKE CARE OF THEM ARE. PROVIDING THEM WITH JOBS THAT PAY THEM A LITTLE WEIGHT AND SO FORTH BUT WHY WHY NOT JUST LIMITED. TO TO THE AGENCIES TO TALKING TO EACH OTHER TO THE DATA BEING COLLECTED. AND THE PUBLIC SAFETY SAFETY ASPECT THAT WILL ALLOW US TO CREATE BETTER PLANS FOR THE HUMANS AND THE ANIMALS ON THE ROADS. WHAT THIS IS EXACTLY WHY THE BILL IS THERE ASSEMBLY WOMAN TO BRING EVERYBODY TOGETHER AND BRING AWARENESS TO IT IMAGES OPENS THE DOOR SO AS I SAID IT'S NOT A PERFECT BILL BUT IT'S A DOOR OPENER? TO SAVE LIVES PREVENT ACCIDENTS AND THIS IS THE FIRST STEP AND SO IT IS A COMBINATION OF THINGS BUT THE COMMISSION AS I HAD MENTIONED THE COMMISSION THAT WILL BE IN CHARGE OF OVERSEEING THIS. AND THAT'S A PILOT PROGRAM SO THEY'LL THEY HAVE THE POWER TO EXPAND IT -- IN AND SHUT IT DOWN ON SOME AREAS AND EXPANDED TO SOME AREAS WHO HAVE GOT TO GIVE THE COMMISSION THAT OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT. AND WITH THE DATA THAT COMES AND THEY'LL BE ABLE TO GET BACK TO US IN A REPORT BACK TO US AND SEE HOW WE CAN EXPAND IT. TO GET TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON CERTAIN AREAS. KING ANSWER DOUBLE WIRE WE INCLUDING THE TAKE WHY IS THAT TAKE PART IMPORTANT THIS BILL BECAUSE IT'S NOT LIMITING IT. TO DATA. INTO CHILD HAVE TO HAVE TWO SEPARATE BILLS -- AND THEY WOULD EVENTUALLY JOIN TOGETHER YOU GET PRETTY HARD TO HAVE ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT PART THING TO ME WHY I NEED TO TAKE FOR FOR PUBLIC SAFETY MONITOR. SO -- MOST OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE TERMS WERE USING CALTRANS HEATS P. IS REFERRING TO STATE HIGHWAYS BUT THE MAJORITY OF ACCIDENTS A PROBABLY A NON STATE HIGHWAYS. AND WE STILL NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THOSE AREAS. ARE IN THE MAJORITY OF ACCIDENTS WHERE COLLISION WITH WILDLIFE AREN'T REPORTED. AND SO IF WE WANT TO FIND OUT WHERE THOSE ARE IN TO DISCOVER THE THE LEVEL OF IMPACT WE NEED THE PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT. AND THERE'S OTHER WAYS -- IN SWEDEN THEY REQUIRE THE PUBLIC TO REPORT A COLLISION WITH AN ANIMAL BUT SINCE WE DON'T HAVE THAT IS HOW DO WE ENCOURAGE A VOLUNTARY REPORTING. AND THIS IS ONE WAY -- I'M NOT SURE WHAT OTHER WAYS THERE ARE BUT THIS IS ONE WAY IS TO REWARD WITH MEAT SALVAGING FROM THE ANIMAL IT'S BEEN HIT. AND WHY NOT JUST FOLLOW THE SIMILAR PROGRAM ASSN FOOD AND JUST TO MANDATE THAT WE HAVE TO REPORT -- I'M I WOULD THINK THAT WAS FINE THAT'S A DIFFERENT ROAD TO CLIMB -- AND MAYBE THAT'S THE END OF NEXT YEAR THE YEAR AFTER BUT IN IN OTHER WESTERN STATES PROVIDING THIS KIND OF REWARD FOR REPORTING HAS DOUBLED THEIR RATE OF OF DATA COLLECTION FOR COLLISIONS WITH LARGE ANIMALS THAT CAN BE SALVAGED. THIS IS TRUE IN IDAHO -- I'M NOT SURE ISSUE IN WASHINGTON BUT CERTAINLY IN IDAHO WHICH IS THE LONGEST RUNNING PROGRAM. IF I MAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALSO OFTENTIMES LOOKED LIKE DOCTOR SELLING MENTIONS. YOU KNOW ON ON THE MAJOR THOROUGHFARES ANIMALS ARE PICKED UP PRETTY QUICKLY BY C. H. BEING CALTRANS BOUGHT ON A LOT OF THE ROADS AWAY FROM THE MAJOR THOROUGHFARES I LIVE UP AND AND ALTERADO COUNTY AND A DEAR WILL LAY ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. SOMETIMES FOR WEEK TEN DAYS AND SIMPLY ROT. BUT WHEN THOSE ANIMALS ARE LAYING OUT THERE THE ATTRACT OTHER PREDATORS WHICH OFTEN TIMES CAN CAN RESULT IN ADDITIONAL ACCIDENTS AND SO FORTH. SO GIVING THE THE GENERAL PUBLIC THE ABILITY TO SALVAGE THE EDIBLE PORTIONS OF WHAT HELP CLEAN THOSE ATOMS UP SPECIALLY IN THE AREAS THAT ARE OFTEN THE MAJOR THOROUGHFARES. SO THAT CAN PROVIDE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS THE PUBLIC SAFETY BECAUSE AGAIN THOSE ANIMALS OUT OF THERE AND ELIMINATING THE POSSIBILITY OF PRINTERS COMING OUT AND TAKING THEM AS WELL. YOU KNOW QUESTIONS. STREAMING. NOT A QUESTION I JUST A COMMENT PLEASE -- YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN VARIOUS ATTEMPTS OVER THE YEARS I WAS JUST LOOKING AT THE ANALYSIS -- FOR RELATED LEGISLATION NOT NOT LEGISLATION THAT DOES EXACTLY WHAT THIS DOES BUT LEGISLATION THAT TRIES TO HAVE CALTRANS TAKE THE REDUCTION OF ANIMAL KERR COLLISIONS MORE SERIOUSLY. TO INCENTIVIZE THE BUILDING OF THE BOMB WILDLIFE CORRIDORS AND THE OVERPASSES AND GIVEN THAT THESE COLLISIONS -- CAN CERTAINLY LEAD TO HUMAN DEATH AS WELL AS ANIMAL DOT THAT SEEMS THAT THAT SHOULD BE. THE FOCUS OF WHAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE ARE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH IS MAKING SURE THAT WE DO BILL THE OVERPASSES AND THAT WE DO LOOK AT IT -- AT THE DATA THAT TALKS ABOUT WHERE WE HAVE MORE ANIMAL COLLISIONS AND EITHER SLOW TRAFFIC DOWN OR RE ROUTE TRAFFIC OR DO WHATEVER WE NEED TO DO TO MAKE IT SAFER. FOR YOU KNOW FOR PEOPLE IN CARS AND YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD IN THE THE ONE OH ONE IN LOS ANGELES WE'VE HAD AT LEAST THREE MOUNTAIN LIONS KILLED. IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS ALONE AND YET THEY'RE STILL NO OVER PASS IN THAT AREA -- YOU KNOW WHICH CONNECT WHICH RIGHT NOW DIVIDES TO SORT OF PUBLIC WILDERNESS AREAS. SO WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THAT AND I APPRECIATE THE INTENT OF THIS BILL -- I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF PEOPLE WHO TRY TO TAKE THIS WITHOUT REALLY UNDERSTANDING THE HEALTH RISKS WITHOUT KNOWING HOW TO PROPERLY FIELD DRESS I WORRY ABOUT. THE POTENTIAL DANGER OF PEOPLE STOPPING ALONG THE ROAD -- YOU KNOW CREATING ANOTHER AND SAFE CONDITION SO FOR DEBT TO TODAY I'M GOING TO BE -- JUST NOT VOTING ON THE BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU. RIGHT SEEN ALL THE QUESTION DOCTOR. YET I THINK THAT WAS ON MY INTEND TO CLARIFY BUT THE FOR THE READING THE ANALYSIS -- NOW YOU'LL BE IN WE'RE ALLOW THE MOTORIST TO RECOVER. SO IT THAT CONCERNS ME THAT -- YOU HUMAN FATALITY IN OUR TRYING TO REMOVE A AND AND WHATEVER OF THE CAR MAY NOT SEE AND THE NEXT AND FINALLY HIT THE PERSON AGAIN -- SO BECOME A VICTIM SO -- BEFORE WE WAS SO ILLEGAL NOW WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE IT LEGAL. SO PURPOSE TO INTENT IS GOOD STUFF BUT THOUGHT I WONDER WHAT THAT THIS BILL WILL IN THE IN DANGER. THE HUMAN LIFE TO FLOOD SAID THAT IT SOUNDED BUT WILL ENSURE A AGAIN ASSEMBLY MEMBER REMEMBER THIS IS TO NOTIFY BRING COMMUNICATIONS TOGETHER AND SOME OF THESE ROADWAYS THAT WERE NOT FAMILIAR WITH BECAUSE YOU KNOW I'M FROM LA COUNTY ORANGE COUNTY. BUT THERE'S AREAS WHERE YOU DON'T SEE ANOTHER PERSON FOR THIRTY FORTY MILES AND I THINK ANYONE WHO IS LIVES UP AND AND THE NORTHERN PART OF CALIFORNIA YOU CAN ACTUALLY DRIVE THIRTY FORTY MILES. AND NOT SEE ANYONE ELSE AND SO THIS QUICKLY WILL BE ABLE TO TO COMMUNICATE WITH EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AND AND I'M SURE -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER ATHLETES MIGHT COMMENT ON THAT AS WELL. YES I WILL. BE BEING ONE OF THE FEW -- ROLE DISTRICT MEMBERS. SAID I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ACTUALLY BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND WOULD LOVE TO JOIN ON AS A CO AUTHOR WITH YOU -- I I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS OF SOME MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ABOUT AS FAR AS TRAINING AS FAR AS A LOT OF THESE THINGS. BUT IF YOU ASK ANYBODY THAT LIVES IN A RURAL COUNTY -- WHETHER IT'S INYO COUNTY TULARE KERN ST BERNARD YOU KNOW AND AND ON UP -- YOU KNOW THESE THINGS HAPPEN ALL THE TIME. THESE THINGS CAUSE FURTHER ACCIDENTS -- I GREW UP IN AN AREA THAT FOUR THOUSAND FEET. ON BACK MOUNTAIN ROADS. THESE THINGS HAPPEN ALL THE TIME AND EVEN THOUGH THE LEGAL PEOPLE% TO GET OUTMOVE THE ANIMAL. BECAUSE THEY KNEW THE NEXT GUY GOING DOWN WOULD HIT IT. TO AND THEN WHAT THEM TO GO OFF A ROAD RAFEAL CLAIRE FOR INTO A RIVER SOMETHING MUCH WORSE. CHAU A AND IT'S ABOUT TIME WE DO. TAKE HIS BILL FORWARD WE DO MAKE IT LEGAL SO THAT WAY PEOPLE IN THESE RURAL AREAS CAN DO WHAT'S RIGHT AND MOVE THESE ANIMALS. SO THERE'S AND FURTHER HARM DONE TO EVERYBODY INVOLVED SO I APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON THIS. HE EVEN IN IN A NON RURAL AREA I APPRECIATE YOUR ATTENTIVENESS TO WORK ON SOMETHING. OF THAT AFFECTS RURAL AREAS THAT REALLY AFFECTS A LOT OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS INVOLVED SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU YOU HAVE A MOTION A SECOND AND YOU CALL AUTHOR -- I THINK WE'VE GOT ALL QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ASKED A MASK FOR A BROKEN [inaudible] THANK YOU.

PLEASE GOOD MORNING A GERMAN -- GARCIA AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS HI IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE -- SP FOUR OH TWO IS A FIVE YEAR EXTENSION TO IN YOUR COUNTIES ADVENTURE TRAIL PILOT PROGRAM -- IN TWENTY ELEVEN SB SIX TO WAIT ESTABLISHES PILOT PROGRAM WHICH ALLOWED INYO COUNTY TO DESIGNATE SPECIFIC COUNTY ROADS AS COMBINED USE ROUTES FOR OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE USE. UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO PROGRAM DELAYS BECAUSE OF PROTRACTED LITIGATION THERE'S NOT BEEN ENOUGH TIME FOR A COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION OF THE PILOT. THE GOALS OF THE PROGRAM ARE TO INCREASE TRAFFIC SAFETY IMPROVE NATURAL RESOURCE PROTECTION REDUCE OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE TRESPASS ON PRIVATE LAND IN MINIMIZE IMPACTS ON COUNTY RESIDENTS. NEITHER THIS BILL IN NOR THE EXISTING PILOT PROGRAM CREATE A SINGLE NEW TRAIL OR WROTE. IT DOES HOWEVER CREATE A BETTER NETWORK OF TRAILS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY A LEGAL AND REGULATED MEANS TO ACCESS EXISTING MAINTAINED TRAILS. ADDITIONALLY. BY HAVING A LINK TRAIL SYSTEM LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS THE TOOLS PROPERLY DIRECT -- H. V. USERS TO APPROVED ROUTES IN REDUCE THE NEED TO POLICE ILLEGAL ACTIVITY. THIS PROGRAM IS IMPORTANT LOCAL ECONOMY INYO COUNTY WHICH CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF HIGH DESERT WITH LESS THAN 2% PRIVATELY OWNED LAND. HAS A ROBUST -- EACH BE COMMUNITY AND RELIES EXTENSIVELY ON TOURISM DOLLARS. THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS VOTED UNANIMOUSLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS EXTENSION IN THIS BILL HAS RECEIVED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT THROUGHOUT THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE ON AS FOUR OH TWO AND ALONG WITH ME TODAY ARE INYO COUNTY SHERIFF CHAPALA WILL. AND PAUL SMITH RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVE OF CALIFORNIA RC RC. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS -- I AM JEFF ALL THE SHERIFF OF INYO COUNTY OF IT HERE TO SUPPORT AS BEFORE TO AND I'D LIKE TO MAKE JUST A COUPLE COMMENTS. THE ADVENTURE TRAIL PROGRAM HAS HAD BROAD PUBLIC SUPPORT. SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HAS HAD TEN PUBLIC HEARINGS. AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE PUBLIC GIVE TESTIMONY INTERACT WITH THE BOARD. AS WELL AS A PLANNING COMMISSION AS IT RELATES TO THE EVENTUAL TRAILS PROGRAM. DURING THE TIME OF THIS THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT HAS RECEIVED NO COMPLAINTS -- RELATED TO THE ADVENTURE TRAILS NO TRAIL PROLIFERATION. HAS BEEN OBSERVED NO ACCIDENTS NO LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. IN NO INCIDENTS. NONE OF THE PROJECTED OUTCOMES DESCRIBED BY THE OPPONENTS OF THE PROGRAM OF TAKEN PLACE. IN REPORTS OF A OF VIOLATIONS ON EACH VIS HAVE BEEN UNRELATED TO THE INVENTION TO CHARLES PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM ALLOWS WHICH HE USES TO USE EXISTING COUNTY MAINTAIN ROADS TO ACCESS CAMPGROUNDS TRAILS IN SERVICES. TO PROTECT OUR NATURAL RESOURCES BY EDUCATING AND ENCOURAGING ONLY TO BE USERS TO RESPECT OR JUST A DISTINCTIVE LANDSCAPE. THIRTY NINE OF THE FORTY FOUR MILES OF THE CURRENT SYSTEM ARE ACTUALLY COUNTY MAINTAINED ROADS. THE OTHER FIVE MILES THAT ARE IN THIS ARE ALREADY APPROVED FOR ONLY TO BE USE. BY UTILIZING THE EXISTING ROADS TROUBLE INFORMATION AND RELIGION IS REDUCED. WE ENCOURAGE AND EDUCATE GOING TO BE GROUPS TO PARTICIPATE AND STEWARDSHIP PROJECTS FOR THE FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES THAT CONTROL MUCH OF OUR UNIQUE LANDSCAPE. THE PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EIGHTY PROGRAM IS SOLELY FUNDED BY GREEN STICKER GRANT FUNDING NO GENERAL FUNDS HAVE BEEN USED. WITH THE SMALL SCALE OF THIS PROJECT ONLY SEVEN ROUTES. WE'VE HAD LIMITED ECONOMIC BENEFITS SO FAR BUT WE'RE STARTING TO SEE HIM ESPECIALLY ONE CAMPGROUND OUTSIDE THE COMMUNITY OF BISHOP. IN CLOSING I WOULD LIKE TO SAY A PRIORITY FOR THIS PROJECT HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO INFORM AND ENGAGE THE PUBLIC. IN THE RULES AND REGULATIONS FOR THE USE AND ENJOYMENT OF THE ALTERNATE SYSTEM OR EXCUSE ME VENTURE TRAIL SYSTEM. MORE TIME IS NEEDED BOTH EDUCATE THE PUBLIC AND EVALUATE THE PROGRAM. I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR US BEFORE TO TO CONTINUE THE VENTURE TRIALS PILOT. AND THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS PAUL SMITH WITH RC RC RURAL COUNTIES REACHED OUT TO SHORTFALL THE WILLS POINT THE REASON WE'RE HERE ASKING FOR ANOTHER EXTENSION IS DURING THE LAST EXTENSION -- DEBATE -- NOT ALL OF THE TRAILS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED DUE TO A RESOLUTIONS WITH -- A LAWSUIT THAT OCCURRED SEVERAL YEARS AGO ON THE PROJECTS ARE NOW. WE HAVE. YOU KNOW ALL SEVEN TRAILS UP AND RUNNING AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO THE EVALUATION WHAT IS NEEDED HERE IS SOME EXTENSION OF TIME SO WE URGE THE BILL. A TO MOVE FORWARD. WITH SPEAKS. FOR BOTH. THOSE WHICH IF WE CAN OPPOSITION. IT WILL BE BACK WITH THE ANSWER QUESTIONS. MATHIS CENTER IS THE GRAY BILL ON A SURE FOUL WELCOME TO SACRAMENTO ON GLAD YOU WERE ABLE TO MAKE THE TRIP OVER -- CAN'T SPEAK HIGHLY ENOUGH ABOUT WHAT YOU ALL ARE DOING WITH THE ADVENTURE TROLLS OUT THERE IN ALL OF THESE THINGS CENTER I'D LIKE TO MAKE SURE WERE ADDED AS A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR -- TODAY. AND LOOK FORWARD TO THIS BILL MOVING TO THE FLOOR. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. TREATMENT I'M GONNA MAKE A COMMENT I UNDERSTAND I THINK AND I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO INTO CHANNEL THESE FOLKS INTO LEGAL AREAS AND MAKE SURE THAT THEIR YOU KNOW IN A SORT OF A SANCTION PLACE THAT HAS BEEN CREATED FOR THEM. I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS AND I'D LIKE TO BETWEEN NOW AND WHEN THE BILL COMES BACK ON THE FLOOR TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHO THE PEOPLE ARE FOR UTILIZING THIS AND WHETHER THIS IS HAVING THE EFFECT. OF GETTING THEM OUT OF PLACES THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE I ALSO RIDE A VEHICLE IN THE FOREST BUT MIGHT HAS FOUR LEGS AND FOR AND I HAVE COME ACROSS ILLEGAL OFFROAD PEOPLE M. IN THE ANGELES FOREST AND SEEN THE DANGER THAT THEY CREATE WHEN THEY'RE IN PLACES THEY'RE NOT. SUPPOSED TO BE AND THE DAMAGE THAT THEY CREATE IN THOSE AREAS SO I IF THE GOAL IS TO GET THOSE PEOPLE INTO PLACES WHERE -- WE CAN KEEP THEM OUT OF OTHER PLACES I I GET THAT BUT I WANT TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHETHER YOU'RE REALLY ACHIEVING THAT OR YOU'RE JUST BRINGING MORE PEOPLE OUT INTO THESE. INTO THE WILDERNESS WHERE AND THEY'RE JUST KIND OF GOING EVERYWHERE SO I'M GONNA LAY OFF THE BILL TODAY BUT HAPPY TO SIT DOWN WITH YOU BETWEEN NOW AND WHEN IT COMES BACK.

THANK YOU I THINK IT CHAIRMAN AND TO I APPRECIATE THAT THE COMMENTS THAT THE SIMPLY WOMAN -- PUT FORWARD WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT FOLKS UNDERSTAND THE REAL MOTIVATION FOR THIS IS THAT A PILOT PROGRAM IS DESIGNED. FOR ODD TO TO SEE IF THE IDEA WORKS AND WITHOUT A PILOT PROGRAM COMPLETING ITSELF SO THAT DATA METRICS COULD BE OBTAINED. I IT IT'S WITHOUT ITS PURPOSE SO I THINK IDEAS MAKE CERTAIN THAT WE LEARN FROM THIS PROGRAM. AND FOR FOLKS WHO ARE ARE -- CONCERNED ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT THE THE PURPOSE OF THIS IS ALSO TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT FOLKS ARE NOT DEGRADING THE ENVIRONMENT AND AS SUPPORTED THAT WE VOLUNTEERED. THAT MIDWAY THROUGH THIS PILOT THAT -- WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER ENVIRONMENTAL UPDATE AND REVIEW -- WE SATIN CONSULTATION OR DISCUSSED WITH THE SIERRA CLUB IN AND OTHER FOLKS AND THEY WERE PLEASED WITH THAT WITH THAT CONTRIBUTIONS SO WITH THAT COLLEAGUES I I APPRECIATE THE CONSIDERATION I WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST DRIVE OF TODAY THANK YOU WE'LL ASK.

GOOD MORNING AT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM HERE TO PRESENT SB FIVE FIVE NINE ALONG SIDE MY DEAR FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER DR WALKING AROUND BE LEFT. OF FIRST I STEPPED ALL OF THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND THANK YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE. STAFF FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THIS BILL. SB FIVE FIVE NINE IS A DISTRICT BILL THAT SUPPORT IT'S FIXING THE FRANKLIN CANAL PROJECT CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE LONG TERM SECURITY. AND ECONOMIC VITALITY OF THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. UP ALTHOUGH THE FRANK KERN CANALIS FEDERALLY OWNED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LONG AGO HANDED OFF ALL RESPONSIBILITY. FOR THE CANAL TO LOCAL WATER USERS WHO HAVE PAID THE FULL COST OF CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OVER THE PAST SEVENTY YEARS. AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S ABSENCE THE CANALS INFRASTRUCTURE. HAS AND IS CRUMBLING 60% OF THE CANALS CAPACITY TO DELIVER WATER HAS BEEN LOST IN THE LOWER PORTION OF THE FACILITY -- DUE TO LAND SUBSIDENCE AS A RESULT OF THE RECENT HISTORIC DROUGHT. THE CANAL IS VITAL FOR DELIVERING WATER. TO RECHARGE GROUNDWATER AQUIFER'S RELIED ON BY COMMUNITIES IN MY DISTRICT AND BEYOND ESPECIALLY ON THE VALLEY'S EAST SIDE LIKE ORANGE COVE LINDSEY FRESNO AND OTHERS. EMITATIONSON CANAL DELIVERIES WILL FURTHER CHALLENGE THE VALLEY'S ABILITY TO MEET THE STATE IT'S SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT ACT GOALS. UNFORTUNATELY FOR SB FIVE FIVE NINE IS AN EFFORT TO HELP MY DISTRICT MEET THESE GOALS. TODAY WITH ME I HERE'S ALSO TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IS ALEX BEARING REPRESENTING DIFFERENT WATER AUTHORITY. AND DIVINE MOHAR REPRESENT ARVIN EDISON WATER STORAGE DISTRICT. AND I'LL GO AHEAD AND HANDED OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE. THANK YOU AND WHAT AN HONOR IT IS TO HAVE A SENATOR WHO I CAN WORK WITH AND PARTNER WITH ON THINGS AS IMPORTANT AS WATER TO OUR COMMUNITIES -- I JUST WOULD LIKE TO IF I CAN MISTER CHAIR SAVE MY COMMENTS AS A REBUTTAL FOR ANY OPPOSITION THAT WE FACE AND ALLOW -- THOSE HERE IN SUPPORT TO TAKE MY TIME. THE MOTION AND A SECOND PLEASE -- THANK YOU CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK BRIEFLY. LIKE SENATOR HER DAUGHTER SAID MY NAME IS ALEXANDER BEARING I WORK FOR FRONT WATER AUTHORITY WE OPERATE MAINTAIN FRANK KERN CAL WE'RE ALSO THE BILL SPONSORED. IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THE CAT THE CANALS BURTON FROM MORE THAN JUST AGRICULTURE. IT'S PART OF A STATEWIDE WATER INFRASTRUCTURE AND DELIVERY SYSTEM AND ONE OF THE AUTHORIZED PURPOSES FOR THE CANAL IS STILL OF DELIVER NOT JUST IRRIGATION AND MUNICIPAL SUPPLIES BUT ALSO WATER FOR GROUND WATER RECHARGE. IN MOST YEARS MORE THAN HALF THE WATER THE CANAL DELIVERS A SPECIFICALLY USED TO RECHARGE GROUNDWATER AND NOT THE WATER THAT'S BEEN BEING UNABLE TO BE DELIVERED BECAUSE OF THIS SUBSIDENCE PROBLEM UP TO THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRE FEET PER YEAR. WHICH IS MORE THAN HALF THE SIZE OF MILLERTON LAKE FOR EXAMPLE. YOU'LL LIKELY HEAR TODAY THAT THE STATE SHOULD INVEST IN THIS PROJECT BECAUSE IT'S A FEDERAL RESPONSIBILITY IT'S ACTUALLY A LOCAL RESPONSIBILITY. LIKE SENATOR HER DAUGHTER SAID WE'VE BEEN OPERATING MAINTAIN THE CANAL FOR MANY YEARS WE PAY THE FULL COST OF THE CANAL SINCE NINETEEN FORTY NINE ALMOST ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL. IN CONSTRUCTION MAINTENANCE AND WE'VE BEEN FULLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CANAL UNDER CONTRACT WITH RECLAMATION SINCE. NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HOLDS TITLE TO THE CANAL LIKE THE PINK SLIP -- BUT WE PAID OFF MORE WORKING AGGRESSIVELY TOWARDS OBTAINING TITLE FOR THE FACILITY SO WILL BE FULLY LOCALLY OWNED AND CONTROLLED. YOU MAY ALSO HEAR THAT THE CANAL DOESN'T BENEFIT BENEFIT ANYONE BUT FARMERS. THAT'S NOT TRUE EITHER MOST OF THE EAST SIDE COMMUNITIES AND HOUSEHOLDS RELY ON THE SAME GROUND WATER AQUIFER'S. FURTHER SUPPLY THAT THE CANAL WAS BUILT TO HELP MORE THAN SEVENTY YEARS AGO. THEY'RE ALSO AFFECTED BY THIS PROBLEM AND WOULD BE HELPED BY THE SOLUTION. AS AN EXAMPLE TULAREID IS ONE OF THE THE CANAL USERS. THEY NOTICED THAT SOME OF THE GROUND WATER QUALITY IN THE NEARBY COMMUNITY FOLKY FEEL WAS MUCH BETTER NEAR THE GROUND WATER RECHARGE BASIN. AND SO THEY PARTNERED WITH SELF HELP ENTERPRISES TO PURCHASE SOME LAND ON THE NORTH SIDE OF OKEY BILL TO ESTABLISH A NEW GROUND WATER RECHARGE BASE AND TO HOPEFULLY ACHIEVE THE SAME BENEFITS THAT THEY'VE SEEN ELSEWHERE. THOSE ARE THE SORTS OF PROJECTS THAT ARE POSSIBLE RIGHT NOW BUT WILL BE LESS POSSIBLE UNLESS THIS PROBLEM IS ADDRESSED. FINALLY SOME CRITICS SAY THAT IS THE STATE SHOULDN'T OR CAN'T OR DOESN'T INVEST IN FEDERAL PROJECTS. IN FACT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS INVESTED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FEDERALLY CONSTRUCTED LOCALLY MAINTAIN FACILITIES FLOOD CONTROL PROJECTS ARE PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THE SORT OF INVESTMENT IN OUR STATE WORD STATEWIDE NETWORK OF INFRASTRUCTURE. JUST LIKE THE FRANKLIN CANALIS WITH OUR WATER CONVEYANCE SYSTEMS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF STATE INVESTMENTS AND LOCAL FACILITIES IS THE OWNER ALL AMERICAN CANAL LINING. THE COMMITTEE SHOULD KNOW THAT WE'VE ALWAYS USED THIS AS A POTENTIAL LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL PARTNERSHIP. LOCAL AGENCIES IN CANAL USERS ARE COMMITTED TO PAYING A SHARE OF THIS PROJECT AND ARE VALLEY DELEGATION CONGRESS AND SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN OF COMMITTED TO SEEK APPROPRIATIONS FOR FELL INVESTMENT AS WELL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION IF THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER THEM I DIDN'T GET INTO THE TECHNICAL DETAILS OR ANYTHING ELSE LIKE THAT SO THANK YOU TO BE HER THANK YOU. THE QUICKNESS THANK CHAIRMAN OTHER MEMBERS -- AGAIN MY NAME IS JIM MORE HARM WITH THE THE ARVIN EDISON WATER STORAGE DISTRICT -- WHERE THE LAST CONTRACTOR ON THE FRANKLIN CANAL AND WE ARE BY FAR THE MOST IMPACTED DISTRICT -- OF THE FRANKLIN COME OUT FROM THE LOSS OF CAPACITY -- FROM AN OPERATIONAL PERSPECTIVE -- THE IMPORTATION OF FRANK -- CANAL WATER INTO THE SOUTHEAST PORTION OF KERN COUNTY -- HAS STABILIZE WATER LEVELS REALLY FOR THE LAST FIFTY YEARS SINCE WE'VE BEEN IN OPERATION -- AND IN LARGE PART DUE TO THE GROUNDWATER RECHARGE ACTIVITIES THAT WE UNDERTAKE -- THESE RECHARGE ACTIVITIES HAVE PROVIDED A TREMENDOUS WATER QUALITY BENEFIT TO SEVERELY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN OUR AREA -- YOU KNOW SOME OF THOSE LAMONT ARVIN THAT WE'D PATCH -- WHICH WAS DETAILED IN THE THE PULITZER PRIZE BUT GRAPES OF WRATH HE HAS WILL REMEMBER THAT -- THESE SEVERELY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES -- RELY ON DRINKING WATER THROUGH GROUND WATER. IN WHICH OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW WE WE RECHARGE -- IN FACT -- ROBERT RAZA WITH THE ORGAN COMMITTEE SERVICES DISTRICT -- HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE THEY SEE IMPROVE WATER QUALITY CONDITIONS IN THEIR SERVICE AREA WHEN WE ARE RECHARGING IN ARVIN EDISON -- YOU KNOW HAVING THE PREDICTABLE SUPPLY OF WATER SUPPLY -- IT IS ONLY POSSIBLE WITH A FRANKLIN CANAL FIX -- WE'VE GOT TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO RECHARGE THE WE CAN CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THESE BENEFITS GOING FORWARD -- YOU KNOW FRANK -- CANAL IT IS IS DEGRADED NEARLY FIFTY MILES UPSTREAM OF ARVIN EDISON -- IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT -- NOT OUR OPERATIONS YOU KNOW NOT FRONT WATER AUTHORITIES THE OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE -- NOR THOSE THAT ARE SERVED BY THE FRANKLIN CANAL BECAUSE THESE PROBLEMS -- AND NONE THE LESS WE GOT TO FIX THE PROBLEM -- YOU KNOW THE FRANK -- CANAL IS A STATE WIDE. IMPORTANT -- FACILITY -- IT'S NOT A REGIONAL OR LOCAL -- ONLY FACILITY -- WITHOUT THE FIX -- PROVIDED THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE ENOUGH WATER TO RECHARGE BECAUSE WE CAN GET PAST THE THE SUBSIDENCE OWN PLUS WITH THE INCREASED EXTRACTIONS -- BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE WATER TO GET EXTRACTED -- YOU KNOW THE THE GROUND WATER OCT FOR WILL DECLINE. AND OBVIOUSLY WITH CIGNA AND IT'S GOING TO BE -- A PROBLEM AND AND SO YOU KNOW SIGNAL COMPLIANCE -- IN OUR IN OUR MANAGEMENT AREA WILL SUFFER SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS INCLUDING SUBSIDENCE -- IN RECHARGE ACTIVITIES CAN BE MITIGATED -- FOR SUBSIDENCE CONCERNS AND FRANKLIN COULD NOT FIX IS IS IS PARAMOUNT TO OUR SUCCESS. AND CONTINUED BENEFIT TO THE SEVERELY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. FRANKLIN CANAL IS REALLY THE ONLY -- ARTERY ON THE SIDE OF THE VALLEY. SO. WITH THAT I THINK IF YOU GET YOUR TIME AND THANK YOU WE HAVE A HAS TO FOLKS WHO WANT TO SIGN ON IN SUPPORT.

TO BALANCE THOSE INTERESTS OUT SO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF I THINK THAT HAS SOME INSIGHTFUL POINTS AS WE'VE HEARD -- ALSO -- I JUST WANTED TO SAY THANKS TO THE SIERRA CLUB REPRESENTATIVE FOR NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT ISSUES THAT THEY HADN'T FULLY DONE -- LOOKED AT BEFORE I WAS REALLY THAT WAS GOOD SPOT BUT I THINK THAT YOUKNOW. THAT THE FACT THAT -- BROADER ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT THERE IS WORK BEING DONE ON THE BILL AS WE SPEAK IS AN IMPORTANT POINT TO THAT -- THAT WAS MADE IN ALL OF THAT SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS TODAY AND AGAIN THANK YOU THIS VERY DIFFICULT WORK FOR PART OF THE STATE THAT WE'VE BEEN STRUGGLING ON THESE WATER ISSUES FOR A VERY LONG TIME SO I'M GRATEFUL TO SEE US. COMING TO THE POINT THAT WERE AT SALAS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'D LIKE TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR AS WELL IN THE STEAM THAT PRINCE BECAUSE AUTHORS. LISTED ON THE BILL AS WELL BUT YOU KNOW THIS IS A REAL PROBLEM ESPECIALLY NOT JUST FOR THE VALLEY BUT REALLY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE TALK ABOUT TRYING TO GET CLEAN DRINKING WATER TO COMMUNITIES THAT. ARE REALLY SUFFERING. WE GOT A FIX CALIFORNIA'S PIPES SB FIVE FIVE NINE HELPS FIX CALIFORNIA'S PIPES. RIGHT WE KNOW WE'RE LOSING MILLIONS OF ACRES OF WATER EVERY SINGLE YEAR BECAUSE OF SUBSIDENCE THE SUBSIDENCE ON ON THE FRANK CANAL IS SIGNIFICANT AND WE ALSO HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA AQUEDUCT AS WELL. FOR TALKING ABOUT REALLY TRYING TO MEET OUR CALIFORNIA GOALS. OF SIGMA FOR TALKING ABOUT TRYING TO MEET SAFE DRINKING WATER GOALS SB FIVE FIVE NINE AS PART OF THE SOLUTION I JUST WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR HER WORK ON THIS. ISSUE AND I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE MEASURE HERE TODAY AS WELL AS FRIEDMAN FALL BUT MISTER MATHIS. THANK YOU -- I DON'T KNOW THIS AREA VERY WELL SO -- I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE PROJECT A LITTLE MORE SO YOU'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND NOT HAVING SAFE DRINKING WATER WHICH I I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND IS A HUGE CONCERN IN A PROBLEM IN THE AREA. BUT I'M TRYING TO RECONCILE THAT WITH THE STAFF ANALYSIS OF THE BILL A WHICH I'M JUST GOING TO READ FROM THAT AND MAYBE YOU CAN RESPOND AND I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION IT SAYS THE FRANKLIN CANAL IS USED ALMOST ENTIRELY. BY TWENTY AGRICULTURAL WATER AGENCIES WHICH COLLECTIVELY -- GATE EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE THOUSAND ACRES OF FARMLAND -- AND THEN IT GOES ON TO SAY THAT IT'S THOSE SUBJECTS AND THE FIRE WATER AUTHORITY THAT SHOULD SHARE THE COST OF REPAIRING THE CANAL NOT THE STATE REPAIRS. SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN THEIR DRINKING WATER BUT THE ANALYSIS IS PAINTING A PICTURE OF A CANAL THAT'S BEING USE COME COMPLETELY BY AGRICULTURAL -- CONCERNS NOT BY. YOU KNOW MAYBE THOSE ARE DOWNSTREAM USERS. BUT IF THAT'S THE CASE WHY ARE WE TALKING WHY ARE WE NOT TALKING ABOUT THOE AGRICULTURAL USE WHERE WE TALKING KEEP TALKING ABOUT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHEN THEY'RE NOT USING THE CANAL ACCORDING TO THE ANALYSIS. AND THEN SECONDLY WHY SHOULDN'T THOSE AGRICULTURAL USERS BE PAYING FOR THE PROJECT. AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHICH OWNS THE PROJECT SO WHY ARE WE LETTING THE GOT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OFF THE HOOK WHEN THEY SHOULD BE PAYING FOR THIS THERE THE OWNER OF IT. WHY ARE WE DIPPING INTO THE GENERAL FUND FOR THE REST OF THE REPAIRS TO PAY FOR AN AGRICULTURAL WATER PROJECT? IF I MAY I'D ACTUALLY REALLY APPRECIATE THE QUESTION BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT WE WROTE THE ANALYSIS AND WHILE I TRULY DO RESPECT -- THE COMMITTEE'S WORK ON THIS BILL I WOULD HAVE DISAGREED AND SAID THAT IT'S BOTH THAT WE BOTH HAVE FARM LAND AND FARM WORKERS WHO. ARE IMPACTED BY WHAT HAPPENS ON THE FRONT KERN CANAL AS TESTIFIED. BY THOSE IN OUR BEEN EDISON BUT IS NOW THEY'RE GETTING THEIR WATER FROM THE CANAL SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THERE'S A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILE CANAL TO GET FROM MILLER TEN LAKE DOWN TO BAKERSFIELD WHERE OUR COLLEAGUE IN THE SOUTH IS FROM. AND ROUGHLY ABOUT AT ABOUT MILE MARKER ONE HUNDRED THERE SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH SUBSIDENCE THAT IT'S DECREASING CAPACITY DUE. TO THE COUNTY ROADS THAT ARE OVER LYING AT NOT ALLOWING IT TO BE FILLED FULLY NOW I WOULD LOVE TO INVITE YOU DOWN AND SHOW YOU AT FIRST HAND BECAUSE WHAT OCCURS IS BY THE DECREASE IN CAPACITY IT LEADS TO US NOT BEING ABLE TO HAVE SUSTAINABILITY. IF I CAN'T GET THE WATER TURNED TO WHERE WE'RE DOING RECHARGE. I CAN'T HAVE LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY IN THE VALLEY BUT AND THAT'S IT THIS IS THE PROJECT GOING TO NOW BRING CLEAN WATER TO THE PEOPLE THAT YOU KEEP MENTIONING BECAUSE IT'S READS AS THOUGH THIS IS GOING TO FARMS NO THIS IS YET AND WE TALKED ABOUT ORANGE COVE AND THE MAYOR OF ORANGE COVE IS WHICH IS ON THE EAST SIDE IS. MAYOR VICTOR LOPEZ DAME RELY UPON THE WATER FROM THE FRONT KERN CANAL FOR THEIR CLEAN DRINKING WATER. WITHOUT THAT ABILITY OF HAVING THE FRONT KERN CANAL IN THAT CAPACITY WE'RE GOING TO AFFECT AREAS. LIKE EAST PORTER FELL AND OTHER AREAS IN THE VALLEY AND SO I'M -- I'LL PROBABLY TO STOP SERAPHINA MIGHT FOR THEN I WOULD ASK -- STAFF TO RESPOND TO THAT BECAUSE IF YOU'RE SAYING THAT THEIR ANALYSIS IS AND CRACKED I'D LIKE TO COME HERE THEIR RESPONSE TO THAT. OKAY AND THEN AND THEN I WILL ALSO -- ASKED IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR MAYBE COULD ANSWER SOME A MISREAD BINS CONCERNS IT'S LOW LET'S FINISH YOUR QUESTIONS AND THEN I'LL ALLOW EITHER THE WITNESSES ARE YOURSELF AND THEN AND I'M GONNA READ AGAIN FROM THE ANALYSIS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I HAVE YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW TO BASE MY DECISION. ON IT SAYS THE FRONT WATER AUTHORITY HAS A CONTRACT WITH THE U. S. BUREAU OF RECLAMATION TO MAINTAIN THE CANAL INCLUDING HEAVY MAINTENANCE OF THE KIND NEEDED. CURRENT PULMONARY ESTIMATES FOR THE FULL RESTORATION OF THE CANNELLA ROUGHLY TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WITH THE FRYING DIVISION OF THE CV P. AMOUNTS FOR MORE THAN A MILLION ACRES THAT'S TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS PER ACRE. THIS IS NOT A HEAVY BURDEN I WOULD ACTUALLY BE A LIGHT BURDEN FOR REGION GROWING HIGH VALUE ORCHARDS AND OTHER CROPS IT IS MORE THAN REASONABLE TO REQUEST THAT YOU SB ARE IN FRONT WORK TOGETHER TO RESTORE THE FRANK KERN CANAL. ANY DELAY. OR AVOIDANCE UNDERTAKING THE RIGHT. THE RECONSTRUCTION OF THE CANAL UNTIL SOMEONE ELSE PICKS UP THE TAB MILLION MERELY ILLUSTRATES THAT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE TENDED TO WITH URGENCY NOW THAT THEY'RE SAYING THAT THE ARGUMENT IN OPPOSITION -- I THINK STAFF IS JUST. I DON'T IN THAT THEY'RE ARGUING THAT THEY'RE SAYING THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE HAVE ARGUED AGAINST IT THAT'S GREAT SO I AM CONCERNED THAT WERE NOW USING TAXPAYER MONEY. TO BAIL OUT THESE VERY LARGE AGRICULTURAL AND I LOVE I LOVE CROPS AND I LOVE FARMS BUT IF THEY'RE GROWING HIGH VALUE CROPS AND ARE CAPABLE OF DOING THIS FOR TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS PER ACRE -- WHY DO WE THEN HAVE TO TAKE MONEY FROM THE TAXPAYERS WHO COULD BE INVESTING IN AREAS WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO HAVE YOU KNOW LARGE INDUSTRY COME IN AND HELP THEM AND IF IF I MAY AND? CANNOT KEEP PACE THROUGH YOU MISTER CHAIR -- I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE COLLABORATION AND FOR US TO FIX THIS PROBLEM WE CAN'T KEEP KICKING THIS CAN DOWN THE ROAD AND FOR TOO MANY YEARS WE HAVE SPENT. MONEY LOCALLY UP TO A BILLION DOLLARS TO HELP TO REPAIR IT. THERE LOCAL LEGISLATORS ARE NOW ASKING FOR SOME STATE SUPPORT AS WELL BECAUSE OF THE CRISIS THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY AND SO THE AGRICULTURAL THOSE FARMS AND FRY AND IT'S ALL FOR THEY ALSO KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD OR THE INVESTING. I'M HAPPY TO STEP IN HERE AND ADD A COUPLE DATA POINTS -- SO I JUST WANTED TO RESPOND TO ONE THING THAT YOU SAID EARLIER MISTER YOU'RE NOT MISS FRIEDMAN ABOUT -- YOUR QUESTION ON WHO IS REALLY BENEFITING AND DOES THIS ACTUALLY HELP -- COMMUNITIES THERE AND HOW THEY RELATE AND GROUND WATER. THE ONE OF THE GREATEST TRAGEDIES OF THIS PROBLEM RIGHT NOW IS THAT. THE WATER THAT CAN'T BE DELIVERED IS ENTIRELY TO BE USED FOR RECHARGE SO. ALL OF THOSE COMMUNITIES FOR RELYING ON GROUNDWATER AQUIFER'S THAT THIS CANNELLA SUSTAIN FOR SEVENTY YEARS. ARE GOING TO BE IMPACTED BECAUSE THAT'S THE WATER THEY CAN'T BE DELIVERED SO THERE'S STILL SOME WATER IS BEING DELIVERED FOR AG USERS. BUT THE WATER THAT THEY WOULD GENERALLY TAKE WHEN IT'S A REALLY HIGH FLOW CONDITION AND JUST SINK DOWN TO THE GROUND THEY CAN'T TAKE. AND SO THAT THAT'S THE IMPACT THAT COMES TO THAT BROADER COMMUNITY BEYOND JUST THE PEOPLE THAT ARE TAKING SERVICE WATER AND USING IT FOR MUNICIPAL SUPPLIES OR FOR FARM FARMS BY SO. THAT THAT IS ONE YOU KNOW. ONE PART OF THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION YOUR SECOND QUESTION ABOUT -- YOU KNOW WHO WHO SHOULD BE PAYING HOW MUCH SHOULD THEY BE PAYING. THE ALISON ANALYSIS IN HERE POINTS TO TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR FIX. RIGHT NOW THE THE PROJECT THAT WE HAVE FINALIZED THE DESIGN ON IS THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. THAT'S BIGGER THAN TWO ONE MILLION DOLLARS BY A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT WE ARE PUTTING IN MONEY WE ARE HOPE WE ARE ACTIVELY. LOBBYING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHO IS WORKING REALLY HARD TO TRY AND GET AN APPROPRIATION AS WELL FOR THIS PROBLEM I WILL ALSO. I ALSO JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT FRONT WATER THIRTY HAS LOOKED AT OTHER OPPORTUNITIES WITH LIKE LOW COST FINANCING FEDERAL LOANS AND WE APPLIED FOR WITH YOU ALONE LAST YEAR BUT GUESS WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOESN'T LOAN MONEY. TO FIX ITS OWN FACILITIES SO IT DOESN'T LOAN MONEY TO ITSELF SO THAT WAS SOMETHING WE WERE ELIGIBLE -- FOR WE'VE LOOKED AT PRIVATE BONDING AS WELL -- BECAUSE WE DON'T ON THE FACILITY THE THE INTEREST RATES ARE EXORBITANT THERE NOTHING THAT THIS COMMUNITY COULD AFFORD. SO WE'RE RIGHT WE'RE NOT TRYING TO LOOK FOR ANYONE TO BAIL US OUT WE'RE LOOKING FOR PEOPLE THAT CAN BE PARTNERS AN ENTITIES THAT CAN BE PARTNERS SO JUST TO BE CLEAR SO I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND I'M JUST READING FROM THE ANALYSIS THESE ARE NOT MY ARGUMENTS I KNOW. I KNOW THAT'S MY RESPONSE YET WHAT THE STAFF WROTE -- SO THIS IS A FEDERALLY OWNED FACILITY AND YOU'RE ASKING THIS THE TAXPAYERS OF CALIFORNIA TO PAY TO FIX A FEDERAL -- PROJECT. WE'RE ASKING THEM. RESTING TO TO BE PARTNERS WITH LOCALS FOR AND LIKE I SAID BEFORE WE ARE PURSUING TITLE THE TEAM TITLE FOR THE FACILITY BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE A FEW YEARS SO. IT WILL BE A LOCAL FACILITY EVENTUALLY AND RIGHT NOW IT IS ENTIRELY LOCALLY FUNDED SO. WE ARE ASKING FOR FOR THE STATE TO HELP. TO HELP TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS OPPORTUNITY THAT IS THERE TO HELP THE VALLEYMEET SOME OF ITS CRITICAL GOALS THAT ARE REALLY HARD TO MEET FOR IT IN THE NEXT TEN TO TWENTY YEARS WE HAVE ON SIGMA ON DRINKING WATER. THANK YOU SO I I'M I'M DONE I JUST YOU KNOW I WHEN I READ. SOMETHING LIKE THIS AN ANALYSIS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THE RESPONSE AND THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING THESE QUESTIONS I HAVE NOT BEEN TO THE AREA. I'M FAIRLY AGNOSTIC MY WITH MY DAUGHTER STAND WHAT THE RESPONSES TO SERIOUS CONCERNS BROUGHT UP IN ALICE'S SPECIAL WILL TAKE AND WE HAVE A SALAS FALL BUT MISTER. MATHIS YEAH. YES I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY ONE THING THAT PART OF THE ANNOUNCES THE MISTREATMENT OF READING ABOUT WAS FROM THE OPPOSITION WAS FROM OUR LETTER THAT ARE SUPPLIED -- AND SO TO KIND OF RESPECT AND IF I MAY RESPOND TO SOME OF THOSE POINTS JUST TO CLARIFY WHAT WE ARE ARGUING IN THE LETTER -- THE LET IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT FIVE OF THE THIRTY THREE ENTITIES THAT CURRENTLY USE THE CANAL OUR USER FROM MUNICIPAL AND INDUSTRIAL USES. I THINK THAT FRESNO -- CITY COVE WARNS US OUR OWN ORANGE COVE LINDSEY FRY AND MADERA COUNTY OF THOSE FIVE THOSE ARE THE ONLY THAT USE THE OF THOSE ARE THE ONLY ENTITIES THAT USE A FOUR YEAR AND I MEAN START FOR AGRICULTURE MUNICIPAL IN. LIKE USES ALL THE OTHER THIRTY THREE ALL THE OTHER TWENTY EIGHT USE THOSE. USE THE WATER IN THE CANAL FOR AGRICULTURE USES OUR ARGUMENT IS THAT IF YOU ARE ARGUING THAT THIS SHOULD BE USED FOR SAVING AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. DID YOU NEED TO PUT YOUR MARK FIVE THOSE FIVE SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS. PROJECT BASICALLY THE OTHER TWENTY EIGHT PROJECTS THAT ARE USING FOR AGRICULTURE OR NOT AGAINST AGRICULTURE ANYTHING THOSE THAT NEED TO COME FROM ANOTHER SUBSET OF FUNDS NOT NECESSARILY FROM THE FUND THAT YOU'RE ASKING THE RATE PAYERS. THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO USE THAT. THAT I JUST WANNA CLARIFY THAT'S THE ARGUMENT THAT WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE AND AGAIN WE'RE WORKING WITH THE ARE WE WANT TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR TO KIND OF CLARIFY THAT ISSUE. SALAS THANK YOU AND I JUST WANTED TO PROVIDE PROBABLY A LITTLE MORE CONTEXT FOR MISS FRIEDMAN AND OTHERS AS YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT WE KEEP HEARING THE CITIES OF ORANGE COVE LINDSEY SOME OF THOSE THAT ARE ALONG THE EAST SIERRA -- RANGE AND THE THING IS IS ALL OF THOSE COMMUNITIES RELY ON SURFACE WATER. BECAUSE OF THE GRANITE IN THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE AREA THEY CAN'T WATER BANK LIKE OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE. RIGHT THERE'S REGIONAL WATER BREAKS UP AND DOWN THE ENTIRE STATE THEY CAN'T DO THAT THERE'S COMPLETELY RELIANT ON THAT SURFACE WATER. AND BECAUSE OF LOSING SO MUCH WATER IN THE SUBSIDENCE. THEIR ABILITY TO GET THAT SURFACE WATER TO EITHER BLANDER CREATE SAFER DRINKING WATER STANDARDS IS SEVERELY HAMPERED AND THAT'S WHY. YOU KNOW SB FIVE FIVE NINE IS ACTUALLY TRYING TO AIM AT THAT. FOR THE FIRST PART THE SECOND PART OF THE THE QUESTION TERMS OF LIKE. WHO'S PAYING THE FEES THE THING IS IS YOU CAN'T FIX THE WATER PIPE WITHOUT EVERYBODY BENEFITING. SO RATHER THAN WELL I MEAN I WOULD JUST -- EMPLOYER TO EACH OF MY COLLEAGUES AS LIKE LET'S LEAVE NO CALIFORNIAN BEHIND. LET'S LEAVE NO CALIFORNIAN BEHIND AND ACTUALLY HAVE THEM HAVE SAFE DRINKING WATER NO MATTER WHAT PART OF THE STATE THAT THEIR FRIENDS ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE RELIANT ON THE SURFACE DRINKING WATER -- YOU KNOW AND YOU KNOW HISTORICALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FOR THE FRANK KERN CANAL WHO ACTUALLY PAY FOR IT WASN'T INVESTMENT FROM ALL PARTIES THE AG USERS ACTUALLY PAID -- HEAVILY INITIALLY INTO IT -- THEY'RE NOT GOING AND UNTAPPED TO ACTUALLY PAY FOR THIS PROJECT AS WELL IF YOU LOOK AT THE SUPPORT LETTERS YOU KNOW FROM CONGRESS TO WORK WITH. THAT SENATORS DONE WITH SENATOR FEINSTEIN AND SOME OF THE OTHER UP HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IT'S ACTUALLY TRYING TO LIKE WE ALL DO RIGHT WORLD TRYING. TO GET BUNDLES OF MONEY TO PUT IT ALL TOGETHER TO CREATE A GREATER GOOD. INSIDE I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THAT COMMENT THANK YOU MISTER MINISTER MATH OF ALL THE ADVICE HE HIRED. I'D LIKE. TO THING MISTER SALAS FOR HIS COMMENTS ON YOU KNOW FOR BETTER CLARIFICATION ON THIS. THIS SYSTEM IS RUNNING AT A 60% LOS. TO THESE AREAS TO THE EAST SIDE OF THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. I'VE SPOKE IN NUMEROUS TIMES MY FIRST FEW YEARS UP HERE -- COLLEAGUES YOU WILL HELP ME DEAL WITH YOU SIDE PORT OF FILL. IN THE HUGE CRISIS WE HAD THERE WITH IT BEING THE CITY WITHOUT WATER. THAT WAS DUE TO THE SUBSIDENCE. THIS CAN NOW FEEDS THAT CITY. THAT'S THE LARGEST ANNEXATION PROJECT IN STATE HISTORY. AND THE FRIED KERN CANAL PLAYS A VITAL ROLE. IN THOSE PEOPLE HAVING CLEAN DRINKING WATER. NOT TO MENTION ALL OF THE OTHER NUMEROUS [inaudible] TOWNS. COMMUNITIES COUNTY ISLANDS. THAT ARE EXTREMELY DISADVANTAGED. THAT ARE SIMPLY TOO FAR OUT TO REACH TO TIE IN TO BE ANNEXED. AND THIS IS SOMETHING I DEAL WITH DAILY AND MY DISTRICT SO COLLEAGUES ANY OF YOU THAT ARE INTERESTED IN ACTUALLY SEEN THIS FOR HAD STE AND I WELCOME YOU TO COME DOWN I WILL CARVE OUT ANY TIME IN MY SCHEDULE TO BE THERE FOR YOU. IN TO DRIVE YOU OUT TO THESE AREAS AND AND WALK YOU THROUGH IT -- BUT THINK ABOUT THAT. THINK ABOUT HOW YOU WOULD FEEL. IF YOU'RE WATER INFRASTRUCTURE WAS AT A 60%. LOS. YOU WOULD BE DOING THE SAME THING YOU WOULD BE ASKING ALL OF US AS YOUR COLLEAGUES. AND EVERYBODY FROM ACROSS THE STATE QUITE FRANKLY ACROSS THE COUNTRY LIKE WE ARE. BY REACHING OUT WITH SENATOR FEINSTEIN'S OFFICE AND THE CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION. TO GET HELP. THAT IS SIMPLY WHAT WE ARE DOING THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES AT STAKE. AND TO SIMPLY LOOK AT THIS AND SAY WELL ADDS GOING TO BENEFIT AG. TO IS IT REALLY FAIR TO THOSE FAMILIES. BECAUSE IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY THE NUMBER ONE INDUSTRIES AGRICULTURE SO IT'S THAT SECTOR IF IT'S NOT THERE TO DUST BOWL IN MY EYES WILL COLLECT MY ANCESTORS THE OKIE'S AND JUST PACK UP AND LEAVE [inaudible] BUT THIS IS FOR THEIR FAMILIES THIS SO THEIR KIDS. CAN ACTUALLY GET UP AND BRUSH THEIR TEETH SO THE A FLUSH THEIR TOILETS SO THEY CAN ACTUALLY HAVE. VIABLE WATER TO COOK WITH. AND I'VE SEEN IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS BEING IN THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY GOAL WITHOUT CLEAN POSSIBLE WATER. THIS IS A HUGE STEP WE CAN ALL TAKE TOGETHER. TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT SO I UNDERSTAND IF IT THIS. IS SEEN AS A DISTRICT PROJECT OR NOT SEEN AS TAKING CARE OF YOUR AREA. THE YOUR AREA IS GOING TO HAVE NEEDS IN THE FUTURE AND YOU'RE GONNA NEED ALL THE VALLEY CAUCUS MEMBERS TO COME IN AND HELP YOU AND WE WILL. BECAUSE THIS IS ABOUT PUTTING PEOPLE FIRST NOT POLITICS MEMBERS ASKING FOR AN AYE VOTE. THE BIGGEST SUMMER GARCIA. AT THANK YOU CHAIR -- I WANT TO BE SENSITIVE TO THE FACT THAT WE DO HAVE COMMUNITIES -- THAT SHOULDN'T BE LEFT BEHIND ALL OVER THE STATE -- YOU HEAR FROM ME EVERY YEAR IS TO TALK ABOUT THESE COMMUNITIES IN MY BACKYARD. AND I HOPE MR MAT THIS TO GET SOMEBODY WITH SOME OF THOSE BILLS THAT ARE COMING THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE AGAIN THIS YEAR. AND I OFTEN GET ASKED A QUESTION A WHY OTHER PEOPLE WHO DID AND COST A PROBLEM RATHER PEOPLE SHOULD BENEFIT. I YOU KNOW SHOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR SOMETHING THAT THEY DIDN'T DO. AND AFTER SAY I'VE I'VE LOOKED AT ALL THE OTHER CHOICES AND AND I NEED TO FIND A WAY TO TAKE THE SOAPBOX AND A HALF HERE LEVERAGE WHATEVER I CAN TO MAKE SURE I SOLVE IT FOR THESE PEOPLE. ALI TALK ABOUT WATER I HAVE COMMUNITIES IN MY OWN BACKYARD THAT ARE STRUGGLING TO IS LIKE THIS -- WATER DISTRICT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PAY FOR REPAIRS TO THAT WE ARE NOT LOSING 60% BUT WHATEVER WE'RE LOSING. OUT THEIR OWN AND THAT WE DON'T RUN INTO THIS CONSERVE INTO WE DON'T HAVE A SYSTEM THAT WORKS ANYMORE. AND THEY HAVE BEEN QUALIFIED FOR FOR BONDS -- THEY HAVING QUALIFIED FOR LOANS THEY HAVE RAISE RATES TO THE POINT WHERE THE COMMUNITIES KIND OF AT THE BREAKING POINT AND WE CAN'T AFFORD ANYMORE -- AND THEY'VE ONLY BEEN ABLE TO FIND ABOUT ONE THIRD OF OF THE OF THE REPAIRS THAT THEY NEED AND THAT AND THEN FOR STRUCTURE -- AND I THINK IT'S THE BIGGER DISCUSSION OF HOW DO WE MAKE SURE WE THE SYSTEM WE HAVE HIS WORKING FOR SOMEONE OFF EVERYONE AND WE HEAR ABOUT THIS EVERY YEAR WHETHER IT'S OUR BONDS ON WATER -- AND SO FORTH. I I HAVE -- EAT AND AND SO IT'S WHEN PEOPLE CAME TO TALK ABOUT CYCLE I HAVE PROBLEMS THAT ARE RELATED TO THIS WE CAN'T FIND THE MONEY EITHER HOW DO I MAKE SURE OF BECAUSE EVENT OF WATER DISTRICT -- HAS THE MONEY THEY NEED WHEN THEY'RE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN AND DOING THEIR PEACE -- BUT IT DOES I I DO HAVE CONCERNS WITH WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT'S BEEN SO ADVERSARIAL. TO US RIGHT AND AND WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE GIVING THEM SOMETHING -- ALONG THE WAY I'M GOING TO BE. SUPPORTING THIS BILL IN THE THINGS BIRTH THAT I ASK ALL OF YOU GUYS IS A POOR AND MAKE SURE WOULD ONLY BEHIND WORKING CLASS COMMUNITIES THIS ADVANTAGE COMMUNITIES. ARE AND AND YOU WILL CONTINUE TO HEAR FROM FROM THE ON THAT ISSUE FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS THAT I'M HERE. BUT I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE THAT I TALK ABOUT THE DISCOMFORT I HAVE -- BEEN COMING IN TO DO SOMETHING THAT I REALLY FEEL THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE DOING. I AND I HOPE THAT YOU ARE SUCCESSFUL IN YOUR ADVOCACY IN THE AT IN DC. I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT. IF AG IS GOING TO BE BENEFITING FROM THIS THAT THEY'RE PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE. ALONG THE WAY AND WE'LL DISCUSS THIS EVEN AS WE TALK ABOUT HOW DO WE CLEAN UP OUR WATER RIGHT THROUGH OUR CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS AND HOW DO WE MAKE SURE IT STAYS CLEAN. AND AND THE RESPONSIBILITY WILL HAVE INCLUDING THE ACT COMMUNITY. ALONG THE WAY AND SO. I'M GONNA KEEP EMPHASIZING THAT I GUESS AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR ECONOMY I GET THAT BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE ALL PAIN ARE FOR SURE. ALONG THE WAY FOR THE SUSTAINABLE SYSTEM ON AND SO I ECHO SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM GLENDALE -- BROUGHT UP ALONG THE WAY SO ELOQUENTLY EARLIER -- BUT TO THEIR I WILL SUPPORT THE EFFORTS OF OF OUR SENATOR AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER IN THAT AREA AS THEY TRY TO BRING REPEAT FOR THOSE. FAMILIES THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS. SEE NO COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- SOME SENATORS SOME MEMBER SELECT TO CLOSE. WELL JUST.
