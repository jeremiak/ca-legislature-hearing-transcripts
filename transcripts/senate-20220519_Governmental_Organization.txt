RICHARD THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR BEING HERE THIS MORNING AS WELL. I APPRECIATE THE TIME TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THESE NEW AMENDMENTS EXTENDING CONTRACTS THAT WERE SIGNED IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE AND TWO THOUSAND FOR TWENTY SEVEN TRIBES. MY NAME'S NATHAN VOCALLY ON THE SENIOR ADVISER FOR TRIBAL NEGOTIATIONS FOR THE OFFICE OF GOVERNOR NEWSOM. LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING ALL THE TRIBES AND THEIR CHAIRPERSONS HAVE REACHED AGREEMENT ON AN EXTENSION TO THEIR COMPACT I'D SPECIFICALLY LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIRPERSONS OF THOSE TRIBES. SIGNED COMPACTS WITH THE STATE LAST YEAR AND HIS INPUT HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY HELPFUL AND INSIGHTFUL FOR THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. AND AGO SHOOTING A REASONABLE TERM FOR THESE EXTENSIONS. THERE CHAIR MARY NORRIS OF THE QATAR TRY TO LAYTONVILLE RANCHERIA CHAIR ROBERT PINTO SENIOR AND WE HAVE HIGH BAND OF KUMEYAAY INDIANS. CHAIR JANET BILL MCKEON RANCHERIA CHECK CHANCY INDIANS CHAIR FUN MURPHY IN THE RESIDENCY RANCHERIA. CHAIR MELANIE RAFFIN AND WITH THE SURE WOULD VALLEY RANCHERIA POMO INDIANS ENSURE PARENTAL ABOUT THE TABLE MOUNTAIN RANCHERIA. LAST I JUST THE ONE EXTEND TO THE CAR. FOR SANTA ROSA TO RANCHERIA IN THE MIDDLETOWN RANCHERIA SINCE THEN THE GOVERNOR'S AGREED TO EXTEND THE CONTACTS FOR TWENTY SEVEN TRIBES. INCLUDING LINK THEIR EXTENSIONS FOR THOSE. TWO TRIBES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED THE CAMP OF END OF TWO COULD DECLINE YOUR MISSION INDIANS AND THE TABLE MOUNTAIN RANCHERIA. TWENTY SIX OF THE TRIBES AGREED TO AN EIGHTEEN MONTH EXTENSION TO DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE BY ONE TRIBE AGREED TO A TWELVE MONTH EXTENSION. BY WAY OF BACKGROUND IN TWO THOUSAND PROP ONE A. GRANTED TRIBES THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO OPERATE SLOT MACHINES AND BANKING AND PURCHASE SENATE'S CARD GAMES IN CALIFORNIA. IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE AND TWO THOUSAND THE STATE ENTERED INTO OVER SIXTY TRIBAL STATE GAMING COMPACTS PURSUANT TO THE INDIAN GAMING REGULATORY ACT. THESE CONTACTS ARE GENERALLY REFERRED TO AS THE NINETEEN NINETY NINE CONTACTS. THEY WERE A FOR AN INITIAL TWENTY YEAR TERM WITH THE TERMINATION DATE OF DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY. THEY'VE BEEN AUTOMATICALLY EXTENDED AND NOW FIRE BY THEIR OWN TERMS ON JUNE THIRTIETH OF THIS YEAR. THE NINETEEN NINETY NINE COMPACTS ALLOW THE STATE AND TRIED TO AMEND THE TERM BY MUTUAL AND WRITTEN AGREEMENT. BUT EXTENSION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER THE CONTACT. THE MAJORITY OF TRIBES WITH THE NINETEEN NINETY NINE CONTACTS HAVE SIGNED NEW CONTACTS SINCE THEN. THE TWENTY SEVEN TRIBES WITH AMENDMENTS TODAY ARE ALL STILL OPERATING UNDER THEIR NINETEEN NINETY NINE COMCAST. AS I SAID PREVIOUSLY WITH THE COMMITTEE THE NEED FOR THESE EXTENSIONS ARISE FROM THE US DEPARTMENT INTERIORS ACTION IN NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE. TO DISAPPROVE THREE TRIBAL STATE GAMING COMPACTS THAT THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR INDIAN AFFAIRS. BUTTE IS ADDRESSING TOPICS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THE INDIAN GAMING REGULATORY ACT. THESE OF THESE THIS APPROVALS MADE IT APPARENT THAT THE STATE AND THOSE REMAINING TRIBES WITH NINETEEN NINETY NINE CONTACTS WE NEED ADDITIONAL TIME TO NEGOTIATE A NEW CONTACT. WITH SUFFICIENT CONFIDENCE THAT THOSE NEW CONTACTS COULD BE APPROVED UNDER A GROW. AS I MENTIONED BEFORE ALL TWENTY SEVEN TRIBES HAVE AGREED TO AMENDMENTS EXTENDING THEIR CONTACTS THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE EXTENSIONS ARE FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE. WITH ONE TRIBE AGREEING TO A TWELVE MONTH EXTENSION TO JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THE LEGISLATORS RECENT RATIFICATION OF CONTACTS FOR THE SANTA ROSA RANCHERIA IN THE MIDDLETOWN RANCHERIA. SHOULD HELP TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE UNCERTAINTY AROUND INTERIORS DOES APPROVALS. I EXPECT THE THINGS WILL BE BACK ON TRACK BY NOVEMBER OF THIS YEAR NO BIGGER TO CONVERT THAT INTO CONTACT CAN BE NEGOTIATED WITH THOSE TRIBES INTERESTED IN DOING SO. IT'S EXTENSIONS FUNCTION AS AN AMENDMENT TO A CONTACT FOR PURPOSES OF STATE LAW. THEY WERE NEGOTIATED BY THE GOVERNOR AND MUST BE RATIFIED BY THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE. BECAUSE THESE AMENDMENTS ARE ONLY TO EXTEND THE TERM OF THE COMPACTS. UNDER FEDERAL REGULATIONS THEY DO NOT REQUIRE THE APPROVAL OF THE SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT BUT THEY DO STILL HAVE TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT. THESE AMENDMENTS TO EXTEND THE NINETY NINE CONTACTS WOULD NOT PREVENT THE STATE TRIES FROM MUTUALLY AGREEING TO FURTHER EXTENSION SHOULD BE NECESSARY. I APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S TIME TODAY AND IF YOU'D LIKE ME TO READ A LIST OF THE TWENTY SEVEN TRIBES I'D BE HAPPY TO DO SO I'LL ALSO REMAIN AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.
