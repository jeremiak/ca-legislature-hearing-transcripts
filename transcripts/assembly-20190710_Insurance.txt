AND WHAT I'D LIKE TO SUGGEST -- WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM YET. BUT SENATOR HILL IS ON A TIGHT SCHEDULE AN OMINOUS SUGGEST WE HEAR CENTER HILLS BILL WITH THE SUBCOMMITTEE. IF THAT SIR IF THAT WORKS FOR YOU SENATOR. THANK YOU THIS IS THE JULY TENTH TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN HEARING OF THE ASSEMBLY INSURANCE COMMITTEE. PLEASE GO AHEAD SENATOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COLLECTION OF THE IN THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT SB FIVE THIRTY SEVEN IT'S A BILL THAT SEEKS TO REDUCE MEDICAL DISPUTES. AN INCREASE TRANSPARENCY IN THE OPERATION OF MEDICAL PROVIDER NETWORKS FIRST LET ME BEGIN BY TAKING THE AMENDMENTS RECOMMENDED IN THE ANALYSIS. AND AS DISCUSSED IN THE ANALYSIS MEDICAL PROVIDER NETWORKS OR MP ENDS ARE A KEY TOOL IN OUR WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM TO ENSURE THAT INJURED WORKERS GET THE TREATMENT THEY NEED IN A COST EFFECTIVE WAY. MP AND ALSO ENSURE THAT WORKERS HAVE ENOUGH CHOICE TO ACCESS MEDICAL CARE WITH PROVIDERS THAT THEY ARE COMFORTABLE SEEN. HOWEVER MORE AND MORE STAKEHOLDERS HAVE STEPPED FORWARD WITH CONCERNS ON HOW IMPIAN ARE OPERATING. MEDICAL PROVIDERS HAVE DOCUMENTED INSTANCES OF ALTERED MEDICAL BILLS BEING SUBMITTED TO EMPLOYERS BY IN PEONS. EMPLOYERS HAVE RAISED CONCERNS THAT THEY DO NOT ALWAYS KNOW. WHAT THEM PEONS ARE DOING IN THEIR NAME INCLUDING NEGOTIATING REIMBURSEMENT RATES? IS IT IS THE EMPLOYERS AND MEDICAL PROVIDERS NOT THE MPA ENDS WHO ARE LEGALLY LIABLE FOR REIMBURSEMENT AND BILLION ISSUES THIS LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IS A PROBLEM FOR ALL STAKEHOLDERS. SB FIVE THIRTY SEVEN ADDRESSES THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY BY REQUIRING THE MPA ENDS DISCUSS ANY CHANGES TO MEDICAL BILLS SUBMITTED TO AN EMPLOYER WITH THE MEDICAL PROVIDER ADDITIONALLY SB FIVE THIRTY SEVEN WILL PROVIDE EMPLOYERS WITH. TRANSPARENCY SO THAT THEY WILL NOTE THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES RECEIVED BY THE PROVIDERS THAT WORK WITHIN THEIR MPN. IF THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES ARE MORE THAN 15% BELOW THE OFFICIAL MEDICAL FEE SCHEDULE. NOW AS OF LAST FRIDAY I BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL WAS UNOPPOSED. BUT WE FOUND OUT FROM WORK YOU FROM YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF THAT THAT WAS NOT THE CASE. I HAVE INSTRUCTED MY STAFF TO WORK WITH ASSEMBLY INSURANCE -- COMMITTEE STAFF. A VERY CAPABLE STAFF BY THE WAY MISTER CHAIR. AND THE OPPONENTS TO SEE IF ADDITIONAL MEMBERS ARE NECESSARY TO PERU TO PREVENT THE PUBLIC RELEASE OF PROPRIETARY INFORMATION. AT THE IN THE AND MY GOAL IS IS TRANSPARENCY EMPLOYERS A MEDICAL PROVIDER SHOULD KNOW WHAT IT'S DONE IN THEIR NAME -- AT THIS TIME I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE DR -- RICK CATCH CHAIR OF THE PAYMENT POLICY COMMITTEE FOR THE CALIFORNIA PHYSICAL THERAPY ASSOCIATION AND POLL GASPAR WITH THE INDEPENDENT PHYSICAL THERAPIST OF CALIFORNIA DETENTIONS. EDUCATION TO WHO'S HERE FOR AT THE PORTENTS OF SB [inaudible] FIVE THIRTY SEVEN THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU YEAH PLEASE GO AHEAD WITH YOUR COMMENT SIR HI. MORNING -- MY NAME IS RICK KATZ VÃ  DR PHYSICAL THERAPY TO SERVE ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOR THE CALIFORNIA PHYSICAL THERAPY ASSOCIATION. I'M ALSO BUSINESS OWNER PHYSICAL THERAPY PRACTICES IN NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. SB FIVE THREE SEVEN INCLUDES ESSENTIAL PROVISIONS THAT CORRECT LOOPHOLES IN EXISTING LABOR CODE IN THE TWENTY FOURTEEN SB EIGHT SIXTY THREE WENT A LONG WAY AND CRACKING ISSUES. WITH CALIFORNIA OFFICIAL MEDICAL FEE SCHEDULE WHICH ENCOURAGE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS AND PHYSICAL THERAPISTS TO RE ENTER THE MARKET AND PROVIDE CARE FOR THE FOR THE INJURED WORKER. CALIFORNIA ADOPTED THE WIDELY USED OUR B. R. B. S. SYSTEM IN ADDITION TO ADOPTING NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED A CALM GUIDELINES. WHICH ESTABLISHED PARAMETERS FOR DETERMINE MEDICAL NECESSITY AND APPROPRIATE TREATMENT UTILIZATION HOWEVER OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS HAS BEEN IN AN ENTRANCE OF THIRD PARTY ENTITIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE CREATED AN OPPORTUNITY TO NARAL PROVIDER NETWORKS. WHICH IS LED TO CARE BEING DRIVEN TO THE LOWEST COST PROVIDER WITHOUT REGARD TO QUALITY AND TREATMENT THESE DISCOUNTS ARE DRIVEN THE MARKET DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY. TOO AGAIN DISCOURAGE PROVIDERS PARTICIPATING IN THE WORKERS COMPENSATION ARENA IN ADDITION THESE ENTITIES WHICH ARE REFERRED TO AS MIDDLEMAN INTERFERE WITH THE TREATMENTS PLAN. PLAN DEVELOPED BY REFERRING PHYSICIANS AND PHYSICAL THERAPISTS AND THAT'S BASICALLY SET ASIDE THE THE CALIFORNIA ADOPTED A CALM GUIDELINES. THESE MIDDLE MEN ENTITIES NAMES ARE LISTED IN THE AM PM DIRECTORIES INSTEAD OF THE ACTUAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDER THAT'S PROVIDING THE CARE. THAT'S ELIMINATING THE ABILITY FOR SAY REFERRING PHYSICIAN TO SUBDUE SELECTOR DOWNSTREAM PHYSICAL THERAPIST RATHER PROVIDER. NETWORK TRANSPARENCY MANDATES EXIST IN THE PRIVATE AND COMMERCIAL INSURANCE MARKETS AND IS MANDATED IN CALIFORNIA STATE LAW. BUT SUCH REQUIREMENTS DID NOT EXIST IN WORKERS COMP SO WE'RE TRYING TO ADD BASICALLY PARITY BETWEEN THE TWO SYSTEMS. LASTLY THESE NETWORKS HAVE BEEN FOUND TO TAKE PROVIDER CLAIMS SUBMITTED TO THE NETWORK BY PRACTITIONERS EVERY PRICE THE CLAIMS TO INCREASE THEIR OWN PROFIT WHICH IS. FRAUD. THE PRACTICES OF THESE NETWORKS HAVE GONE AS FAR AS TO PIT ONE PROVIDER AGAINST ANOTHER WITH THREATS THAT PATIENTS WILL BE RE DIRECTED. TO A COMPETITOR IF THEY DO NOT ACCEPT LOWER RATES AND DECREASED TREATMENT UTILIZATION. THESE ACTIVITIES OCCUR WITHOUT INVOLVEMENT FROM THE EMPLOYER RESULTS IN DELAYED ACCESS TO CARE FOR THE INJURED WORKER. THE NETWORK NEGOTIATE THE PRICE WITH THE CARRIER. AND THEN DISCOUNTS THAT PRICE TO THE PROVIDER AND KEEPS THE REMAINING SAVINGS SUCH PRACTICES DRIVE DOWN PRICING TO THE TO THE PROVIDER THE ONLY BENEFITS THE MIDDLE MAN AND ADDS NO VALUE TO THE EMPLOYER OR THE INJURED WORKER. DELAYED ACCESS TO CARE IS PROVEN TO RESULT IN HIGHER HEALTH CARE IN EMPLOYER COSTS. WELL THIS BILL DOESN'T DIRECTLY CURTAIL THESE EGREGIOUS AND ANTI COMPETITIVE PRACTICES. IT BEGINS THE PROCESS OF ADDING SOME TRANSPARENCY IN PRICING. SO THAT THE EMPLOYER CAN SEE WHERE THE DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT. THIS SHOULD BE LITTLE CAUSE FOR ARGUMENT AGAINST DISCLOSING THAT A LARGE PART OF WORKERS COMPENSATION DOLLARS ARE GOING TO ENTITIES THAT PROVIDE LITTLE MORE THAN NETWORK MANAGEMENT AND PATIENT [inaudible] STEERAGE. THESE PRACTICES RESULT IN A FEDERAL LAWSUIT BETWEEN INDEPENDENT PHYSICAL THERAPISTS REPRESENTED BY A DOCTOR PAUL GASPAR. AND ONE SUCH MIDDLEMAN ENTITIES WHICH EXPOSED THE WEAKNESS IN CALIFORNIA LAW THE LAWSUIT RESULTED IN THE SETTLEMENT THAT CURB SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES OF ONE OF THESE ENTITIES. FOR TO FIND PERIOD TIME BUT DID NOTHING TO STOP OTHERS FROM FOLLOWING THE SAME PRACTICES. THE LAWSUIT IS ENFORCEABLE VIA THE FEDERAL COURT SYSTEM BUT DOES LITTLE TO CHANGE LONG TERM PRACTICES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE PURPOSE OF SB FIVE THIRTY SEVEN IS TO RESTRICT AND MONITOR THESE BEHAVIORS ENTRY FORM EXISTING LAW WHERE IT IS NEEDED.% SB FIVE THIRTY SEVEN ALSO PROMOTES THE ABILITY OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE OFF OF THE DUST RELATIONS. TO EXERCISE THEIR AUTHORITY FOR INVESTIGATION AND FORSMAN WE KINDLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY IN SB FIVE THIRTY SEVEN FOR THE BENEFIT OF CALIFORNIA INJURED WORKERS CALIFORNIA PROVIDERS AND EMPLOYERS. CAN THANK YOU TO SENATOR HILL FOR BRINGING THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE FORWARD AND TAKE YOU TO THE COMMITTEE FOR HEARING THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS SIR BEFORE WE PROCEED TO THE NEXT -- COMMENTER I'D LIKE TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM LET'S TAKE ROLES SO WE CAN BE OFFICIAL DAILY HERE MAYES HERE. BERMAN [inaudible] BIGELOW. CALDERON CHEN. CHU. COOLEY. COOPER. FRAZIER [inaudible] GIPSON [inaudible] GRAYSON [inaudible] KAMLAGER-DOVE [inaudible] VOEPEL. ALL RIGHTS TO WE HAVE A QUORUM OF PLEASE GO AHEAD SIR. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME TODAY MY NAME IS DOCTOR PAUL GASPAR I'M PRESIDENT OF THE INDEPENDENT PHYSICAL THERAPISTS OF CALIFORNIA. FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK SENATOR HILL FOR A BILL THAT HAS MANY GOOD THINGS SENATE. AS DR KATZ MENTIONED OUR ORGANIZATION WAS THE PLAINTIFF. IN A FEDERAL LAWSUIT AGAINST THE ONE OF THE OPPONENTS OF THE BILL. AND THE CALIFORNIA CHIROPRACTIC ASSOCIATION A YEAR LATER FILED A SIMILAR LAWSUIT. THAT WAS -- THANK YOU THE INDEPENDENT OF KICKBACKS EXTORTION SCHEME. AND INTERFERENCE WITH THE PATIENT DOCTOR RELATIONSHIP. AMONG OTHER THINGS. OUR VERY PLEASED WITH MANY ASPECTS OF THIS BILL IT GOES A LONG WAY TOWARDS. REDUCING INTERFERENCE WITH THE PATIENT DOCTOR RELATIONSHIP IT -- IT -- MANDATES THAT PHYSICAL THERAPISTS AND THEIR NAMES AND THEIR ADDRESSES AND THEIR PHONE NUMBERS. ARE LISTED IN THE EMPTY AND PROVIDER DIRECTORY TO PREVENT WHAT WE WOULD CALL ILLEGAL STEERING TO THE CHEAPEST PROVIDER WHICH WE DON'T THINK OF THEM. THE PATIENT'S BEST INTERESTS. LOTS OF GOOD STUFF ON THIS BILL WHAT WE WEREN'T ABLE TO DO WITH THE LAWSUIT WAS WE WEREN'T ABLE. TO FORCE REASONABLE PAYMENT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT THE COURT WOULD DO FOR US. HAVE. YOU HAVE A LITTLE CHART THERE I THINK AND IN SOME OF YOUR INFORMATION THAT SHOWS YOU WHAT PHYSICAL THERAPISTS ARE ACTUALLY PAID TO TREAT WORKERS COMP PATIENTS. AND TO THE OPPONENTS AND OF THIS BILL PAY PHYSICAL THERAPIST OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS AND CHIROPRACTORS. LESS THAN 50% OF THE FEE SCHEDULE. LESS THAN 50% IT SEEMS KIND OF WEIRD [inaudible] I HAVE. IN. PRIVATE INDEMNITY INSURANCE WE HAVE RULES THAT. MANDATE THAT 80% OF THE MONEY. GOES TOWARDS THE PATIENT BUT SOMEHOW. INJURED WORKERS ONLY DESERVE 50% OF THE MONEY GOING TOWARD THEIR CARE. IT SEEMS A LITTLE ODD. AND THAT'S WHY A LOT OF PATIENTS TRY TO AVOID THE WORKERS COMP SYSTEM ALTOGETHER IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THEY REALLY CAN'T GET THE CARE THAT THEY DESERVE. OBVIOUSLY OUR ORGANIZATION WISHES THAT THE MEDICARE FLOOR WITH STILL IN THEIR MEDICARE PATIENTS ARE EXPENSIVE TO TREAT BUT WORKERS COMP PATIENTS ARE MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE TO TREAT MUCH MORE PAPERWORK CAM. A TOUGHER TOUGHER CASES THE DEAL WITH IN GENERAL. SO OUR POSITION ON THE BILL WERE VERY THANKFUL THIS FOR THIS BILL AND SENATOR HILL AND AND GIDEON'S WORK OUR POSITION AS SUPPORT IF AMENDED. IF THE BILL OF AMENDED FURTHER. WE WOULD HOPE THAT IT DOESN'T DECREASE THE TRANSPARENCY FURTHER I THINK IF PEOPLE REALLY UNDERSTOOD. THAT ONLY 50% OF THE MONEY WENT THE PHYSICAL THERAPIST -- CHIROPRACTORS ARE -- TEAS AND THE OTHER HALF WENT TO OUT OF STATE MEGA CORPORATIONS WE GOT TO KEEP OUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE GOT A LOT OF THINGS TO PAY. FOR SO AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH THIS BILL DOES A LOT OF TREMENDOUS THINGS FOR OUR PROFESSION AND MORE MORE IMPORTANTLY. FOR THE PATIENTS IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU SIR OF IN IS. THIS FINE FELLOW PART OF YOUR IS PRESENTATION GO AHEAD SIR I SOMETIMES SUPPORT BILLS. TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR THE ADJACENT SHELTER HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION ON WORKERS COMPENSATION -- I LISTEN I I CERTAINLY CAN ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH ALL THE COMMENTS OF THE PRIOR TO WITNESSES BUT I DO THINK IT'S INSTRUCTIVE. THAT EMPLOYERS -- AT LEAST MY NUMBERS ARE HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF A BILL THAT THE PHYSICAL THERAPIST OR IN SUPPORT OF I DON'T THINK YOU'LL SEE THAT VERY OFTEN -- A COUPLE OF COMMENTS VERY QUICKLY FROM AN EMPLOYER PERSPECTIVE -- MEDICAL PROVIDER NETWORKS AND CONTRACTING AGENTS -- THAT ARE DESCRIBED IN THE BILL ARE IMPORTANT PLAYERS IN THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM IN A PERFORMING PORTENT FUNCTIONS -- BUT THERE ARE TWO KEY PROVISIONS IN THE BILL. THE POLICEMAN EMPLOYER PERSPECTIVE THAT ARE WORTHY OF SUPPORT. ONE SECTION FOUR OF THE BILL CLARIFIES I MEAN ISSUE DEALING WITH A NORMAL DAYS OF THE WEEK AND WHAT THAT MEANS YOU YOU FIGURE YOU WOULD WE WOULD ALL KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS BUT SOMETIMES THE COURTS GET THINGS MIXED UP. THAT'S THAT'S INCREDIBLY VALUABLE -- IN THAT SECTION NINE OF THE BILL WHICH DEALS WITH THE TRANSPARENCY THESE FOLKS HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT -- IS VERY KEY I EMPLOYERS NEED TO UNDERSTAND -- KIND OF THROUGH ALL OF THESE CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIPS WHAT IS BEING PAID TO THE PHYSICIAN I BECAUSE WHAT WHAT IS ACTUALLY GOING TO THE POSITION IS IS VERY KEY -- IF DOCTORS ARE GETTING TOO LITTLE -- FRANKLY THEY DON'T WANT TO BE IN THE SYSTEM AND IT CAN DRIVE BAD BEHAVIOR -- I I DON'T THINK THERE'S A TON OF COST ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING THAT TRANSPARENCY I THINK THE AUTHOR -- IN THE YOU KNOW THROUGH WORK WITH YOUR COMMITTEE AND OTHERS IS HAS FOUND A NICE. BALANCE THERE AND FOR THOSE REASONS WERE INSTRUCTS FOR THE BILL TODAY. ACCUSER. BROTHER OTHER FOLKS HERE TO SPEAK IN FAVORITE TO ADD ON IN FAVOR OF THIS BILL. PLEASE GO AHEAD GOOD MORNING ALEXANDER THE ONE WITH THE WHITE MAN GROUP HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHIROPRACTIC ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CHRISTIE BELL ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. OTHER PERSONS WISHING TO SUPPORT THE BILL. OTHER PERSON SAID HERE WHO -- WOULD LIKE. TO SPEAK AGAINST THE BILL. ANYONE HERE AGAINST THIS BILL I SEE SOME MOVEMENT BUT I DON'T KNOW IF FOR OKAY THERE WE GO YOU SEE SOME MOVEMENT. LAURIE KAMMER AND I'M REGRETTABLY UP WERE OPPOSING UNLESS AMENDED I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF PAYERS -- ADMINISTRATORS AND NETWORKS -- ANTHEM WORKERS COMPENSATION ONE CALL CARE MANAGEMENT AND MEDICS HEALTHCARE ALL OF WHOM ARE MEDICAL PROVIDER NETWORKS -- I WANT TO THANK SENATOR ILL FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. I WANT IT THANK YOU DIEM BOMB FOR WORKING WITH US -- GOING BACK AND FORTH ON HOW TO MAKE THIS BILL BETTER WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU OVER THE SUMMER RECESS -- TO ARE PERFECT THE BILL THAT WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ON SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NO UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF WITH THAT WE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OTHER PERSONS WISHING. TO SPEAK AGAINST THE BILL YES SIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MY NAME IS DOCTOR JAMES D'AGOSTINO. DOCTOR PHYSICAL THERAPY. AND THE CURRENT PRACTITIONER. AND I RISE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL UNLESS AMENDED. WHEN THIS BILL STARTED OUT HAD GREAT PROMISE COMING OUT OF THE SENATE THIRTY EIGHT ALL? BUT IT LOST ITS COURAGE WHEN IT SLID OVER HERE TO THE HOUSE. WITH THE STRIKING OF SECTION EIGHT SECTION FIVE THREE OH SEVEN ELEVEN LABOR CODE MIDDLE MEN WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE 40% OF THE FEE. PAID TO AND THE SUPPOSED TO BE PAID TO PHYSICAL THERAPISTS TO TREAT WORKERS COMPENSATION PATIENTS. THIS FEE IS NOT EARNED BUT GARNER FROM RACKETEERING BEHAVIOR. BASED ON THE RECENT CIVIL SUITS IN CALIFORNIA THESE COMPANIES THREATEN PHYSICAL THERAPIST FROM LOS REFERRALS UNLESS THEY TAKE THE BELOW COST FEES. WITHOUT REINSERTION OF THIS SECTION MANY PATIENTS WILL NOT BE AFFORDED THE OPPORTUNITY AND THE LUXURY OF WORKING WITH PHYSICAL THERAPIST. SO IN REALITY WHAT I'M SAYING IS WHAT WE ALL DOING HERE IF WE ARE GOING TO ATTACK THE PROBLEM ITSELF. IN MY COMMUNITY WORKERS COMPENSATION IS A DIRTY WORD. IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE SYSTEM OF CARE ESPECIALLY IN MY HISPANIC COMMUNITY IS SO POOR% THAT NJURED WORKERS WILL DENY BEING HURT ON THE JOB. I'M A MEMBER OF A NIGHT PA THAT IS CAPITATED TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND LIVES. AND IT'S BEEN WELL OVER TEN YEARS SINCE MY PRIMARY CARE DOCTORS HAVE REFERRED THE CASE TO WORKERS COMPENSATION WHEN THEIR PATIENTS ARE INJURED. SO WITHOUT THE ADDITION OF SECTION EIGHT YOU CAN BE GUARANTEED THAT MY MEDICAL IN LAKE COMMUNITY WILL WORK DILIGENTLY TO STAY OUT OF THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONCERN. THANK YOU SIR ANY OTHER PERSONS WISHING TO SPEAK AGAINST THE BILL IF NOT -- SENATOR YOU'RE WELCOME. TO DO YOUR CLOTHES SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND IT WE DID REMOVE SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT SOME OF THE PARTS OF THE BILL -- AS IT CAME TO THE ASSEMBLY AND THE REASON WAS IT IT JUST WOULD NOT WORK AND WE FELT THAT IT WAS NOT A NOT APPROPRIATE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT IN IN THE BILL EIGHT IN PRINT TODAY -- SOLVES MANY OF THE PROBLEMS AS YOU HEARD FROM OTHER WITNESSES I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I.

GREAT THANK YOU TRACY AND I SEE SENATOR HERTZBERG IN THE FRONT ROW. AND LET'S. GO IT SB [inaudible] THREE ONE EIGHT WELCOME. TO ASSEMBLY INSURANCE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU FOR ALWAYS BEING SO GRACIOUS AND ON THIS IN EVERY BILL WHETHER WE AGREE OR DISAGREE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WHO SUFFER MY LATE NIGHT CALLS. I'VE BEEN SOMEWHAT INVOLVED IN A FEW OTHER ISSUES AND SO OFTEN HARD TO DO EVERYTHING WITHIN THE MEASLY EIGHTEEN HOURS OF MOST PEOPLE HAVE TO WORK -- LET ME TELL YOU WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT AND I I I I WANT TO FRAME IT INITIALLY IF I COULD FOR A MOMENT. ON TALK ABOUT WHY I'M DOING THIS AND THEN SPECIFICALLY WHY IN LARGE MEASURE I DON'T AGREE WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE COMMITTEE IS PROPOSING AND I'M REJECTING THEM. AND WHY I'M STANDING HERE BECAUSE I WOULD NORMALLY DO THAT AND WHY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT STATEMENT OF WHO WE ARE AS A LEGISLATURE. AND HOW WE WANT TO PROTECT BOND. CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT STATEMENT ABOUT WHAT OUR CULTURE IS WHAT OUR MORALITY IS AND WHO WE ARE. AND LET ME START OUT WITH THE STORY. OF JIM MELA AND HER SON RICKY. BECAUSE IT INFORMS THE CAGE THAT IS BEING USED TO PULL THE WOOL OVER THE EYES OF THIS COMMITTEE AND I ASK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION BECAUSE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT. DISTINCTION IN THE GAME THAT GETS PLAYED OFTEN IN THIS LEGISLATURE BASED UPON ECONOMIC INTERESTS AND NOT PUBLIC POLICY. HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS IT'S MAY TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN RICKY GETS ARRESTED JIMMY LIZ'S MOTHER. SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR BOND -- IDENTITY THEFT AMONG OTHER CHARGES AND SHE'S DOWN THERE SHE'S HAVING A HEART ATTACK THEIR SONS IN JAIL. AND SHE SIGNS WHICH EVER PUT IN FRONT OF FOR WHAT EVER IS PUT IN FRONT OF HER AND PART OF THOSE DOCUMENTS FROM BAD BOY A BAIL BONDSMAN WAS BLANK DOCUMENTS. AND SHE WASN'T TOLD WHAT THEY MEANT SHE WASN'T ANYTHING SHE JUST WANTED TO GET HER SON OUT OF JAIL. HER SON WAS RELEASED ADD BAIL AND WAS NEVER CHARGED AND THE MONEY WAS NEVER RETURNED. SHE MADE WHICH HAPPENS TODAY A DOWN PAYMENT. AND SHE SIGNED A PAYMENT PLAN SHE SIGNED A FINANCIAL DOCUMENT THAT REQUIRED HER JUST LIKE IF YOU BUY A REFRIGERATOR IF YOU BUY ANYTHING ON TIME. SHE SIGNED A PAYMENT PLAN THAT'S WHAT SHE DID. AND SO NOW SHE COMES ALONG AND SAYS AND AND AND OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE STILL COLLECTING THERE'S NO BAIL THERE'S NO ANYTHING THERE'S NO OBLIGATION. LET'S STOP THERE FOR A MOMENT. BECAUSE THAT INFORMS IN FRAMES WHERE I'M AT AS I ENGAGE IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS IN THIS WHOLE ISSUE OF BAIL I CAN COVER TO REPORT BY UCLA CALLED DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS LET ME DO WHAT THEY DID. THEY LOOKED AT FOUR HUNDRED BILL CONTRACTS. AND IN THOSE CONTRACTS I HAVE COPIES OF THEM HERE DESPITE WHAT YOU'RE TOLD OTHERWISE. LET ME CHECK WHAT THEY SAY. THEY SAY IF YOU THAT THAT YOU WAVE YOUR FOURTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS IF YOU SIGNED A BILL CONTRACT. IT NOT ONLY THAT THEY SAY I CAN GIVE YOU THE EXACT COMPANIES THE EXACT EXAMPLES HAVE COPIES OF THOSE CONTRACTS THEY SAY THAT IF YOU HAVE A ROOMMATE IF ANYBODY ELSE IS LIVING WITH YOU. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT THAT THEY TO WAIVE THEIR RIGHTS. THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU SIGNED IT THAT EVEN THOUGH YOU GOT ARRESTED IT DOESN'T SAY A COSINE E. IT'S AS ANYBODY COHABITATING WITH YOU HAVE TO DO THIS. THEY COULD PUT TRACKING DEVICES ON YOUR CAR UNDER THEIR AGREEMENT AND GUESS WHAT IF YOU'RE A POLICE OFFICER YOU TO COURT ORDER TO DO THAT. THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE IN THESE CONTRACTS ARE NOTHING LESS THAN A GREGIS. AND SO WHAT'S HAPPENED IS IN THE MEANTIME AS I WAS WORKING ON THIS LAST YEAR. THAT LITIGATION STARTED IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY JUDGE FINSTER MARKER HAD A CASE I HAVE THE COULD DOCUMENTS BEFORE US TODAY THE COMPLAINT. AND THE THE THE DIMMER WHICH A BIT BUT PLEADINGS BY THE OTHER SIDE BY THE BAIL INDUSTRY NOT THE BILL WAS RECESS. THE BILL MYSTERY SAYS IN THEIR ARGUMENTS LISTEN TO THIS THIS IS ON BELIEVABLE AND THEY HAD TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE. THEY SAY IN THEIR IN THEIR DOCUMENTS AND I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU AN EXACT QUOTE WHICH OUT OF THE DOCUMENT THAT THEY FILED WITH THE COURT. THERE IS NO CALIFORNIA AUTHORITY. THERE IS NO CALIFORNIA AUTHORITY MEMBERS OF THIS LEGISLATURE WHO. IN THE END DOORS LAWS EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK THAT HAS CONSTRUED AN AGREEMENT RELATING TO A BAIL BOND AS A CONSUMER CREDIT CONTRACT. THAT'S THE LEGAL POSITION. THEY HAVE TAKEN A BAZAAR AN UNBELIEVABLE APPROACH. THE LAW DOESN'T APPLY TO US. THAT THERE IS A CRAZY WITH THE TIME THE JUDGE I MEAN WHAT'S HIS NAME UP ROSENTHAL ENACTED THE DEBT COLLECTION ACTED IN THE SEVENTIES WELL DIDN'T SAY BAIL BONDSMAN WILL ALSO DIDN'T SAY ELECTRIC CARS AND OTHER THINGS WHAT MAKES THE SEAT BELTS. IT'S RIDICULOUS. AND SO WHAT I'M DOING. AND WHAT HAPPENED BETH THIRTY EIGHT TO VOTE IN THE SENATE. WHAT HAPPENED WITH THIS ISSUE IS ANALYZE NOT TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE THAT INFORMS THE AMENDMENT? IN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THAT WAS THOROUGHLY ADVISED BY PRETTY SMART LAWYERS. THEY CAME OUT TEND TO DO TO TO NOT VOTING. THERE'S BEEN NO NO VOTES ON THIS BILL. AND I UNDERSTAND THE CAN ARGUE THAT WAS IN THE MEMBERS ON THE SENATE AND APPROPRIATIONS THE LIKE I GET IT. BUT IT'S SUCH A FUNDAMENTAL POSITION BASICALLY WHAT THIS BILL SAYS WHAT THIS BILL SAYS IN THE SIMPLEST TERMS. IS THAT THE BASIC FUNDAMENTAL JURISPRUDENCE THAT WE HAVE BEEN FORCED IN THIS STATE FOR MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS APPLIES TO EVERYBODY. THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A CONTRACT IT APPLIES TO EVERYBODY. AND THERE CHIANG IT DOESN'T APPLY TO THEM AND GUESS WHAT JUDGE FINSTER MARKER SAID. JUDGE FIXTURE MONSTER TOLD THEM YOUR BOOK YOU KNOW WHAT AND HE BASICALLY SAID IN THE COURT CASE THAT HAPPENED SOME WEEKS AGO THE PLAIN LANGUAGE OF THE STATUTE PERSONAL FAMILY OR HOUSEHOLD PURPOSES UNAMBIGUOUS. THE LANGUAGE IF THE LANGUAGE IS CLEAR AND UNAMBIGUOUS THERE'S NO NEED FOR INSTRUCTION NOR IS IT NECESSARY TO RESORT TO ADDITION TO THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE IN OTHER WORDS THEY SAID THE ARGUMENT THAT THEY'RE EXEMPT. FROM THIS IS RIDICULOUS OKAY. AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT AT AT THIS THING THE THE ARE THE ARGUMENT OF WHAT'S REALLY REALLY HAPPENING IN THIS IN THIS SITUATION WHY DO WE HAVE. PARTICULARLY THE SECURITY COMPANIES COMING AFTER US I'M LET'S TAKE AN AMENDMENT THAT I TOLD THE CHAIR. RIGHT BEFORE THIS THIS HEARING TO TO QUALIFY FOR THAT. WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE REAL WORLD IS THAT INPUT BILL AGENT RELATIONSHIPS OKAY. THERE'S THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SURETY COMPANY INSURANCE COMPANY THAT SELLS THE BOND TO THE BILL AGENT. AND THEN THERE'S THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE BELL AGENT AND THE CUSTOMER. IN A NORMAL SITUATION LET'S ASSUME IT'S A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS BAIL THE THAT THAT THEY CHARGE 10% WHICH IS ALSO BEING CHALLENGED. THAT THE IS TAUGHT TOWARD -- TWENTY THREE BOOKS SO THE INSURANCE COMPANY CHARGES TWENTY THREE DOLLARS TO BAD BOY BAIL. JACKSON NAME OF THE COMPANY IF YOU CAN BELIEVE THAT. AND SO BAD BOY BILLS RIGHT TWENTY THREE ON A CHECK TO THE INSURANCE COMPANY AND THEY'RE DONE. THEN THE BAD BOY BILL COMPANY COMES ALONG AND ENTERS INTO A FINANCING AGREEMENT BECAUSE MRS ELITE DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY AND THEY SIGNED AN AGREEMENT THAT SAYS WE CAN DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE. THAT WE SEE IN ALL THE ISSUES TO GO OUT AND COLLECT. YOUR AVAILABLE BILL CONTACT ANNIE HAVE YEAH MY I HAVE A YEAR BUT IT SHOULD SAYS WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO GO OUT AND COLLECT AND THEY GO OUT AND DO ALL THEIR STUFF TO DO IT. AND SO THERE'S A SEPARATION BETWEEN THE SALE OF THIS THING AND IN THE BAD BOY BILL CONTRACT EVERY SINGLE INSTALLMENT CONTRACT IT SPECIFICALLY SAYS. THAT. THERE'S NO LIABILITY FOR THE INSURANCE COMPANY IT IS CLEAR WHY BECAUSE ANY LAWYER WOULD BE DISBARRED WHO REPRESENT INSURANCE COMPANY THAT LET THEM BECOME LIABLE FOR THE ACTIVITY OF A BILL COMPANY IT SPECIFICALLY SAYS IN THE INSTALLMENT CONTRACT. THAT YOU ARE NOT LAW THAT WE ARE NOT LIABLE THIS IS NOT A CONTRACT WITH THE INSURANCE COMPANY. NOW WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON QUITE FRANKLY. IN THIS SITUATION IS THAT. IS THAT THE SO THEY'RE NOT LIABLE ANY THIRTY COMPANIES A WORRIED ALL MY GOD IF WE APPLY THIS IN THIS A CASE PENDING IN THE CASE ALREADY WAS DISPOSED OF THE ONLY QUESTION IS. ARE THEY GOING TO APPEAL THEY'LL BOTH BAD BAD BILL BOYS COMPANIES LOST. IN TERMS OF RETROACTIVITY TO THE ARGUMENT THAT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE MAKING AND THESE OTHER GUYS IS RETROACTIVITY. THAT WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO AND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH IN THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU TODAY THAT THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE WANTS ME TO TAKE THAT I WILL NOT. OF THIS COUPLE MIGHT TAKE BUT I DON'T WANT TO TAKE ON IS BECAUSE THEY'RE SAYING THAT WHAT WE'RE SAYING IN THE LAW IS THAT. IS THAT THIS. THIS IS NOT DISPOSITIVE UNDER THE AMENDMENTS WHAT WE SAY IN THE LAW. IN WHAT WE'RE SAYING HERE THAT THEY WANT TO TAKE OUT IN THE AMENDMENTS IS THE LANGUAGE THAT SAYS THIS PARAGRAPH IS DECLARATORY OF EXISTING LAW. THIS PARAGRAPH IS DECLARED TO EXISTING LAW. BY ME SAYING THE DECLARATORY DIGESTING LAW THAT THEY'RE SAYING IS REPORTING A THUMB ON THE SCALE IN THE EXISTING CASE NOT TRUE. THEY'RE SAYING THAT IT'S RETRO ACTIVITY IS BEING APPLIED NOT TRUE. IF YOU WOULD MAKE A TELEPHONE CALL AND DO THE RESEARCH AT THE LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S OFFICE YEARS WHICH YOU WOULD LEARN. YOU WOULD LEARN THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS THE RIGHT TO CLARIFY THE LAW. THAT THERE'S A DISTINCTION BETWEEN CLARIFICATION RETROACTIVITY. THAT WHAT YOU WOULD LEARN IS THAT IF YOU WANT RETRO ACTIVITY THEY WILL TELL YOU THAT YOU HAVE TO WRITE AS WE HAVE DONE MANY TIMES IN THE PAST. YOU HAVE TO WRITE IN THE LAW THAT THIS IS RETROACTIVE THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY. YOU HAVE TO SAY THAT THIS IS RETROACTIVE PERIOD END OF ISSUE. THERE ARE CASES ALREADY HISTORICALLY WE'VE SEEN I'VE JUST PULLED UP ONE WITH JIMMY GOMEZ DID A BILL IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE PEOPLE HERE VOTED ON THE DEALT WITH IMMIGRATION STATUS OF MINOR CHILD AND IT SAYS IN THE PROVISION. THE PROVISIONS THE SECTION -- DECLARATORY JESTING LOGS ACTED WHAT WE'RE SAYING. AND SO THE QUESTION BECOMES UNDER THE LAW. IS WHAT HAPPENS WE'RE WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU'RE DOING THAT ALL THAT HAPPENS IS WE AS A LEGISLATURE WE AS A BODY ARE SAYING AS A GROUP THAT WE BELIEVE. THAT THIS IS THE INTENT WHAT HAPPENS THERE. WHAT HAPPENS THERE IS THAT THE COURT TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION? THE GENERAL RULE REGARDING RETROACTIVITY IS THE TAX STATURE TO PRESUME TO OPERATE PROSPECTIVELY THAT ON MATTERS OCCURRING AFTER THE STATUTE'S ENACTMENT UNLESS THE LEGISLATURE COULD CLEARLY INTENDS OTHERWISE. WHICH IS SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH AND I GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION NINETEEN NINETY ONE POINT ONE FOUR WHAT ORDER TO HAVE RETROACTIVITY HERE'S THE LANGUAGE YOU HAVE TO HAVE. THIS SECTION APPLIES RETROACTIVELY TO ANY EMPLOYEE MAKES IT CLEAR WE DON'T SAY THAT HISTORICALLY THIS INSTITUTION I HAVE MANY OTHER EXAMPLES HAVE DECLARED OF EXISTING LAW AND BOTTOM LINE IS WHAT THE COURTS SAY IN THOSE CASES WHEN YOU DECLARE EXISTING LAW. IS THAT IN THIS IS THAT THE CASE THAT WAS GIVEN TO A LEDGE COUNCIL MACLEOD VERSES IMPLEMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT. IT IS TRUE THAT IF THE COURTS HAVE NOT YET FINALLY INCONCLUSIVELY INTERPRETED STATUTE AND ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DOING SO A DECLARATION BY THE LEGISLATURE AS TO WHAT TO DO. AS TO WHAT AND EARLIER LEGISLATURE INTENDED IS CONSIDERATION ALL WE'RE SAYING IS A STATEMENT AS TO WHO WE ARE. WITH WE DON'T SAY ANYTHING IF WERE SILENT ON THE ISSUE AND WE DON'T STEP UP THAT SAYS WE WANT CONSUMER PROTECTION WE ARE MAKING A STATEMENT TO EVERYBODY AND TO THIS WORLD WE ARE. NOT GIVING CONSIDERATION TO THE COURT WE ARE NOT BECAUSE WE DO NOT USE THE WORD RIGHT TO ACTIVITY WE ARE SIMPLY GIVING GUIDANCE. SO MY ARGUMENT TO YOU IS THE COURTS ALREADY DECIDED THIS. THAT IS PURE COMMON SENSE THAT THE NATURE AND DEGREE JUST NATURE OF THESE CONTRACTS AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT. AND THE TOTAL STUFF I'M READING PROVISIONS I CAN READ THOSE SPECIFIC PROVISIONS THAT EACH COMPANY THERE'S FOUR HUNDRED OF THEM AS TO WHAT THEY SAY. AND SO THE BOTTOM LINE IS WHITE THE BILL EVERYBODY LIKES BECAUSE THEY SAY GOOD GOING FORWARD. THE ISSUE IS WE NEED TO MAKE IT THE DECLARATORY STATEMENT THE PURCHASE DATE IS NOT RETROACTIVITY AND I WOULD SUGGEST -- HERE IT IS THE BILL BOY CONTRACTORS TO BE CLEAR SAYS JUST EVERYBODY KNOWS. THE INSURANCE COMPANY IS NOT A PARTY TO ANY PREMIUM FINANCING. ANY FINANCIAL AGREEMENT IS STRICTLY BETWEEN THE BAIL AGENTS WAS AGENCY IN THE AND THEN THE DOOR THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY THAT'S WHAT THEY ALL SAY. SO WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING AND WHY THE INSURANCE FRIENDS OF ALL OF OURS ARE COMING HERE AND SAYING TO US WE DON'T LIKE THIS IS BECAUSE THEIR CUSTOMERS OF THE BAIL AGENTS. AND THEY HAVE TO SELL CONTRACTS TO THE BAIL AGENTS AND THEY DON'T WANT TO BE LIABLE FOR THE ACTIVITY AND I'M TELLING YOU I WILL GIVE YOU AN AMENDMENT THAT SAYS. SURE THE INSURANCE DIDN'T NOTHING IN THIS BILL WILL INCLUDE LIABILITY FOR SURETIES BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT THE ONES WHO AND GAVE THE BAD BEHAVIOR. THAT SOLVES IT BUT IT PUTS THE SURETY COMPANIES IN A HORRIBLE SITUATION WHERE NOT FOR LEGAL REASONS. NOT FOR ANY OTHER REASONS I'M CLOSING NOW FOR ANY OTHER REASONS THE BOTTOM LINE IS. FOR BUSINESS REASONS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T BE ADVERSE TO THEIR CUSTOMER WHO'S THE BAIL AGENT WHO ENGAGE IN THIS AGREE JUST ACTIVITY AND FOR THOSE REASONS THIS IS A GOOD BILL. AND FOR THOSE REASONS THE AMENDMENTS DO NOT PROMOTE PROMOTE RETROACTIVITY AND FOR THOSE REASONS IT'S IMPORTANT TO POOL WE ARE AS A PEOPLE THAT WE STAND TALL THAT WE NOW HAVE KNOWLEDGE BEFORE US AS TO WHAT HAS TRANSPIRED IN THIS INDUSTRY. AND WE NEED TO MAKE A STATEMENT TO THE COURTS CAN IN THEIR PARTICULAR JUDGMENT MAKE CONSIDERATION. SENATOR OF BEFORE THE YOUR WITNESSES -- COMMENT I WANNA. TRY TO CLARIFY A COUPLE POINTS RIGHT NOW. FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COMMITTEE -- YOU MENTIONED ACCEPTING. SOME AMENDMENTS YEAH I WANT TO GET THAT ON THE TABLE WHICH AMENDMENT LANGUAGE. ARE YOU. WE SPEAK I HAVE A DOCUMENT IN FRONT OF ME THAT ISN'T PAGEANT AIDED. BUT YEAH I CAN GO THROUGH IT WITH YOU. THE FIRST ONE WELL NOT A FOOT THERE ARE THREE AMENDMENTS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE STAFF. ANALYSIS. ARE THESE IN THEIR A BC WELL LET ME LOOK AT IT ARE THESE I'M JUST LOOKING AT THE BILL. ALRIGHT AND THEN THE THE SECOND QUESTION IS YOU MENTIONED THAT THE COURT HAS DECIDED. AND I WANNA. CLARIFY THAT POINT OKAY FROM. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE'S A COURT CASE IN PROGRESS CORRECT BUT WHEN YOU SAY HAS DECIDED -- LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT FOR A SECOND BECAUSE I HAD NOT HEARD THAT BEFORE OKAY SO. IF YOU COULD CLARIFY THAT POINT AND THEN WE'LL GO BACK TO THE AMENDMENTS PLEASE. SHOW FOR THE ELITE FAMILY BROUGHT THIS LAWSUIT AGAINST BAD BOY RIGHT AND THE THEY SAID YOU'RE VIOLATING THE THESE CONTRACTS THE CONSUMER LAWS BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T -- YOU KNOW TO PROVIDE IF YOU DIDN'T HEAR TO IN YOUR CONTRACT DOESN'T HERE TO IN YOUR PERFORMANCE DIDN'T HEAR TO THE LAWS THAT ARE REQUIRED FOR CONSUMER PROTECTION -- AND THE VARIOUS CONTRACT THAT THE SECTIONS THAT I'M REFERENCING HERE THEY BROUGHT THAT LAWSUIT. AND THEN THE THE THE BILL INDUSTRY PREFER SPOTTED WITH LEGAL DOCUMENTS SAYING SO WHAT YOU CAN VIEW THE YOU THESE THESE. ARE -- CONSUMER LAWS DON'T APPLY TO US I READ YOU THE HEADLINE OF THEIR BIRTH PLEADING BUT CENTER HAVE HAD HAS THERE BEEN A DECISION YET WERE SIMPLY OKAY NO THAT DECISION. THAT DECISION WAS THAT WAS IN A TENTATIVE DECISION I JUST RIVER -- I CAN READ IT TO YOU AND THAT TENDED DECISION HAS BEEN ADOPTED THE QUESTION OF COURSE IS THAT THE BAD BOY BELINSKY COULD APPEAL OF COURSE AND TO GO ALL THE WAY THE SUPREME COURT. BUT THERE HAS BEEN DECISION THEY CAN AND THERE THERE ARE ARGUMENTS WERE DENIED. AND THAT DECISION HAS BECOME FINAL IS THE FINAL OF THE EDGE A JUDGMENT THE LAWYER IN THE ROAD RIGHT HERE WHO WHO'S REPRESENTS THEM. AND THAT'S BEEN FINAL THE ONLY QUESTION IS THERE'S A SIXTY DAY PERIOD. BY WHICH THERE COULD BE AN APPEAL AND THEY CAN APPEAL IF THEY WANT TO APPEAL BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S THE LAW OF THE CASE. SO WE'RE IN THE APPEAL PERIOD NOW IF THEY APPEAL WE DON'T KNOW NO ONE STOLE THE SECOND ONE IS ON NOTICE THE PLO FILED UNLESS YOU GUYS ARE TALKING TO THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY THERE. ARE THE BAD BOY THAT'S TRYING TO APPEAL IS GOING TO BE I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THE STATUS OF THAT COURT CASE BECAUSE I HAD NOT HEARD THE WORD. DECIDED. REGARDING IT IN A IF IF BY JUST ONE OF WANT TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS KNOW. THAT AND I'M GONNA ASK MARK RAKISH TO COMMENT ON THAT ASPECT OF THIS THEN WE'LL GO TO THE AMENDMENTS CENTER. GO AHEAD. COUNSEL CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M MISTAKEN BUT AT THIS STAGE OF THE PENDING LITIGATION. THE TRIAL COURT THE SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE GRANTED -- DENIED DEFENDANT'S DEMURRER SO -- A DIMMER IS AN APPEALABLE THING IT CAN BE APPEALED FOR THE CASE CAN SIMPLY GO TO THE NEXT STEP OF ONGOING LITIGATION WHICH WOULD INCLUDE. THE PRESENTATION EVENT IN EVIDENCE SUMMARY JUDGMENT STAGE AT CETERA THE THE RULING THAT WAS DESCRIBED AS FINAL IS. REALLY THE FIRST STEP IN ANY LITIGATION WHERE THE DEFENDANT COMES IN AND SAYS I DON'T REALLY CARE WHAT YOU ACCUSE ME OF EVEN IF IT'S ALL TRUE DOESN'T AMOUNT TO A HILL OF BEANS -- AND THE JUDGE REJECTED THAT ARGUMENT ALL OTHER ISSUES ARE NOT FINAL AND CONTINUING IN PENDING LITIGATION I SEE COUNSEL NODDING. HER HEAD SO I BELIEVE I'VE ACCURATELY DESCRIBED THE THE STE CURRENT STATUS OF THE PENDING LITIGATION WILK CAN I JUST PUT A FINER POINT MISTER CHAIRMAN COULD THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT I THINK THAT'S MISLEADING. BECAUSE THERE'S TWO ISSUES IN ANY CASE. ISSUE NUMBER ONE IS DOES THE LAW APPLY. AND ISSUE NUMBER TWO OR ONE OF THE FAX. DID THEY DO WITH THEIR CLAIM TO DO. THE QUESTION BEFORE US TODAY IS DOES THE LAW APPLY. THIS BODY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FACTUAL ASSERTIONS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY VIOLATED WHAT HAPPENED WHAT WAS REPRESENTED WHAT THE CONTRACT SAYS AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS. WHAT HAPPENED WAS THE BALLOT JUST BY BOY BAIL INDUSTRY BASICALLY SAID TO THE COURT? YOU'RE SUING ME FOR THIS AND YOU CAN'T SUE ME FOR THIS BECAUSE THE LAW DOESN'T APPLY. WHAT WE'RE ASKING WE'RE DISCUSSING HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE IS DOES THE LAW APPLY? AND WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS A BODY IS TO SAY WE THINK IN GIVING GUIDANCE TO COURTS NOT RETROACTIVITY THAT WE THINK IT DOES APPLY WITH WITH HIS DECLARATORY OF EXISTING LAW. AND COURTS CAN MAKE WHATEVER DETERMINATION THEY WANT TO MAKE BUT FOR US TO JUST SIMPLY KNOW THESE FACTS AND TO IGNORE THEM TO ME IS TO TO TO THUMB YOUR NOSE. AT THE INJUSTICE THAT IS ALL BEFORE IN FRONT OF OUR FACE AND WE NEED TO RE COULD BE A FIRM THE FACT THAT THIS IS THE LAW AND AND THE FACT THAT THAT THAT WAS THE DETERMINATION WHO CARES WHAT THE FACTS ARE IN THE CASE FOR PURPOSES WHAT'S MATTER. WHAT MATTERS IS THE COURT SAID THAT WHAT THE BAIL INDUSTRY IS SAYING THAT WE ARE EXEMPT AND WE DON'T HAVE TO PROTECT CONSUMERS? IS JUST RIDICULOUS. LET SIR. THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS OTHER QUESTIONS ON THESE POINTS AT THIS POINT ELEVEN THEIR OPPORTUNITIES TO ASK QUESTIONS BUT ON THE STATUS OF THE THE LEGAL CASE WHICH IS. WHICH SENATOR HAS REFERENCED ANY QUESTIONS ON THAT POINT. ALL RIGHT AND NOW LET'S GO TO THE AMENDMENTS THAT. TO YOU -- YEAH I WAS LOOK AT IT YOU WOULD TERMS OF WHAT YOU'RE AMENDMENTS A MEMBER THEY KNOW AMENDMENT BE YES AMENDMENT SEE NO. ALRIGHT. COMMITTEE MEMBERS OTHER QUESTIONS ON THAT [inaudible] POINT. SENATOR HERTZBERG -- WILL ACCEPT AMENDMENT BE. ONE OF THE THREE THAT ARE PROPOSED. I'D LIKE TO ASK -- OURS. PAGE THREE PAGE THREE PAGE THREE OF THE NOVEL FELL. THE LAST GARCIA AND I'M ALSO WILLING TO ADD AN AMENDMENT TO THE EXTENT IT AFFECTS THE CHARITES. JUST TO MAKE IT CLEAR BECAUSE I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE I'M NOT GOING AFTER INSURANCE COMPANIES I KNOW INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE TO PROTECT. THEIR CUSTOMER AND THEIR CUSTOMERS ENGAGED IN BAD ACTIVITY BAD BOY BALES THIS BILL DOES NOT APPLY TO INSURANCE SCORE SURETIES. I AM WILLING TO TAKE THAT AMENDMENT BECAUSE I HAVE NO INTENTION I HEARD THAT ARGUMENT LAST NIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME AND I'M LIKE THAT'S NOT WITH THIS BILLS ABOUT. I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WE'RE TRYING TO DO I'M JUST TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE RELATIONSHIP. BETWEEN THE AGENT AND THE CONSUMER AND MAKING SURE THEY TAKE. TREAT CONSUMERS FAIRLY AND THE REASON THIS IS SO IMPORTANT FOR CONSIDERATION FOR THE COURTS. IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE CHIEF JUSTICE'S PRE TRIAL DETENTION WORKING GROUP THAT HERE'S THE REAL REASON BECAUSE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN WITH BAYLOR NOT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH BAIL BUT WE SAW THE PRE TRIAL DETENTION REPORT THAT WAS DONE IN MAY TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN BY A GROUP OF JUDGES APPOINTED BY THE CHIEF JUSTICE SAID THIS. THAT THERE'S ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIVE THOUSAND BILL CONTRACTS A YEAR THAT ARE SIGNED IN CALIFORNIA HOW MANY ARE OUTSTANDING WE DON'T KNOW. EVERYONE OF THOSE FAMILIES EVERYONE OF THOSE PEOPLE. IF YOU TAKE THE VIEW THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE A STATEMENT THAT THIS PROTECTION APPLIES TO THEM COULD BE SUBJECT TO THIS EXTRAORDINARY BEHAVIOR. THE BAIL INDUSTRY HAS TRANSFORMED FROM BEING THE DAYS WHEN MY DAD USED TO GO AND BE A JAILHOUSE LAWYER. ND THEY GIVE THE QUICKLY IS ONE OF HIS CLIENTS WOULD GIVE THE CLERK TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS AND COME BACK AND GET THE TWO HUNDRED BUCKS BACK FROM THE CLERK. TO A SOPHISTICATED FINNCIAL INDUSTRY THAT IS LIKE THE PREDATORY LENDING BUSINESS WITH A HUGE FEES AND COSTS WE'VE ALL HEARD THE ANECDOTAL STORIES ABOUT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF A SMALL BAIL. FEE TURNING INTO TENS AND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT SO IF THE BILL IS TO CONTINUES OR NOT. IF YOU LOOK AT IT PROSPECTIVELY WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO ALL THE PEOPLE AS A BODY COURTS WILL DECIDE WOOD COURTS WILL DECIDE AND THEY HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO DO SO WE'RE NOT ACTING DIRECTOR ACTIVITY. THERE'S NO RETROACTIVITY LANGUAGE HERE ALL WE'RE DOING IS IS DECLARING THE WHAT THE LAW IS WE'VE DONE IT A HUNDRED TIMES BEFORE. MY ADVICE FROM COUNSEL IS THAT CLEARLY THAT IS JUST CONSIDERATION TO THE COURTS I READ YOU THE CASE AND WE'RE TELLING THEM THIS IS WHAT WE BELIEVE CHIU IT DO THE SAME BUT WE'RE MAKING A STATEMENT. AND I CAN'T SIT HERE AND EXCLUDE THAT BECAUSE EVERYONE OF THOSE PEOPLE EVERY DAY BUT THIS THING DOESN'T GET PAST HIS LIVES BEING AFFECTED BY UNSCRUPULOUS PEOPLE WHO SAY. THE BAIL WELL I MEAN THE THE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS LAWS DON'T APPLY TO US THAT IS THE PROBLEM WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE. MRS LEACH SON AND MRS ELITE ARE CONTINUALLY ABUSE GOING FORWARD ON A TWENTY EIGHT MONTH CONTRACT IN ALL OF THESE VERY LONG CONTRACTS THAT EXIST. THE YEAR THE BILL AS PROPOSED -- WOULD WOULD BE EFFECTIVE -- IN APPROXIMATELY FIVE MONTHS -- IF IF IT'S A PASSES THE FINAL STEPS AND SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR -- I WANT TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO BE AWARE OF THAT. AND I WOULD LIKE TO STAFF TO COMMENT ON SENATOR HERTZBERG'S ACCEPTANCE OF AMENDMENT BE. BUT NOT A AND C.. WHAT HOW WILL THIS AFFECT YEAH. CENTERS FOR IT I DO HAVE TO SAY I I HEAR LOUD INTERIOR. THE ARGUMENT THAT TEARS OVER REACHING GOING ON BUT AS A LAWYER LOOKING AT THE BILL I SORT OF FEEL THE PROPONENTS. WHO ARE LOOKING AT THESE EXISTING STATUTES AND JUST SAY WELL THEY? THEY APPLY THEY'VE ALWAYS SUPPLY I AS A LAWYER ACTUALLY FEEL THAT'S AN OVER REACH. SO. I I DON'T THINK. THE ONE ISSUE. JUSTIFIES THE OTHER ISSUE. SOI ACTUALLY AM IN FAVOR OF THAT AMENDMENT A I PERSONALLY. THE BAIL SYSTEM GOES BACK TO ENGLAND SAXON TIMES. IT IT IS A PART OF OUR NATION'S FOUNDING [inaudible] EIGHTH AMENDMENT. THERE IS A YOU KNOW A MULLIN THE AND A HALF OF LAW. AND LEGAL DEVELOPMENT TIED UP TO BAIL SYSTEM. SO THE FACT THAT WE HAVE COME TO A STATE OF AFFAIRS WHERE THIS. SYSTEM WHICH IS SO CLOSELY INTERTWINED WITH THE COURTS. HAS BEEN TREATED AS SORT OF SEPARATE AND APART. DOES NOT SHOCK ME I DON'T THINK IT'S AN ERROR. I THINK IS ROOTED IN THE EVOLUTION OF OUR LEGAL SYSTEM SO. I'M WITH YOU I'VE OFTEN. LOOK AT BILLS ANALYZE BILLS COURSE I DID CONSULTING WORK DECLARATORY LAW WE SEE IT ALL THE TIME. BUT ALWAYS RAISE THE QUESTION FOR ME WHEN I LOOK AS LIKE IS IT FAIRLY STATED. IS IT JUST A NEW WANTS IS IT SOME GRADATION I JUST DON'T THINK THE WHOLESALE ADVOCATES THE STATUTES CAN FAIRLY BE SAID IS IS TO CHARACTERS ASSAULT THAT THEY ALWAYS APPLIED. AND SHOULD BE CONSTRUED TO APPLY. SO I AM. I MEAN I'VE. LOOK AT YOUR BILL. CAREFULLY STORE JUST TO THAT LEGAL LANDS. HAVING DONE. YOU KNOW. BUT LOOK AT IT BILLS FOR A LONG TIME AS YOU HAVE. SO I JUST WANT TO KIND OF SAY BEFORE STAFF JUMPS IN GENERALLY. I'M GONNA HAVE TO DASH. TO A A SENATE COMMITTEE. BUT THAT'S KIND OF WHERE I'M AT TODAY I'M. I'M. I THINK I I WOULD BE AND I AM YOUR BILL OF THAT FIRST AMENDMENT WAS TAKEN. I DON'T THINK I'M AND I ON THE BILL OF ITS NOT BECAUSE THAT'S HOW I DO THE LAW. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER COOLEY. AND OTHER COMMENTS BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS WERE ALSO GONNA HEAR FROM -- PAUL AND OR MARK GO AHEAD. CALDERON MAJORITY LEADER I APOLOGIZE FOR BEING LATE I WAS IN OUR APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE AND WE HAD A LOT OF FOLKS WANT TO SPEAK ON A BILL -- ONE OF THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS ISSUE FOR I'M THERE WITH YOU. ON THE POLICY -- I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE RETROACTIVITY WE LOOK AT RETRO ACTIVITY -- AT CERTAIN TIMES IN THE LEGISLATURE WHEN IT IS WARRANTED I KNOW THAT THEIR SOME PENDING. A PENDING COURT CASE AND DEALING WITH THIS MY ONLY CONCERN BOUT RETROACTIVITY IS. IT YOU KNOW ONE ONE WHEN YOU HAVE BUSINESSES OR INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE. THAT ARE PLAYING BY CERTAIN SET OF RULES IN THE LEGISLATURE LATER COMES AND SAYS. NO YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT PLAYING BY CERTAIN SET OF RULES THAT JUST THAT SET THE PRESIDENT A STANDARD THAT IT MAKES ME. UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF WHERE DOES THAT STOP YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES A HOW MANY DIFFERENT ISSUES CAN WE CONTINUE TO DO THAT [inaudible] AND I I JUST DON'T KNOW IF THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE STEPPING IN APPLYING RETROACTIVITY TO THE SPECIFIC ISSUE UNTIL THE COURTS HAVE. HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A DECISION. ON THAT IF THERE'S A LEGAL ARGUMENT TO MAKE THAT LEGAL ARGUMENT SHOULD BE MADE. AND THE COURTS NOT NECESSARILY BE BROUGHT OUT AND ESTABLISHED HERE WHILE THERE IS PENDING LITIGATION -- AND THIS IS MY OPINION -- HOWEVER I I'M OUT OF POSITION RIGHT NOW -- WHERE I UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ISSUE? AND I UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ISSUE TO YOU -- I AGAIN I'M THERE ON THE POLICY SO TODAY I'M GONNA BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL. HOWEVER THAT I DO ASK THAT YOU CONSIDER SERIOUSLY. WHY IS THIS ITEM MOVES TO THE FLOOR -- THE ISSUE OF RETROACTIVITY IN WHETHER OR NOT. IT'S IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO LEAVE THAT IN THERE TO FACE A SITUATION ON THE FLOOR THE BILL MIGHT NOT BE PASSED OKAY SOMETHING BETTER THAN NOTHING SO I JUST ASK THAT IF THIS BILL DOES MAKE IT TO THE FLOOR. WE CAN HAVE A FURTHER CONVERSATION RETROACTIVITY AGAIN I APOLOGIZE THAT I WASN'T HERE TO HEAR YOUR ARGUMENTS. AS TO WHY YOU BELIEVE THAT IT RETROACTIVELY WAS IMPORTANT HAVE IN THIS BILL -- BUT I JUST I SAYS IS MOVED TO THE FLOOR WE CAN FOR THE CONVERSATION ABOUT AND I DO THINK THAT YOU NEED TO ADDRESS IT BECAUSE I THINK THAT ON THE FLOOR -- THAT IF IT DOES IF I MOVE THERE WON'T HAVE THE SUPPORT THAT IT NEEDS WITH THAT AND THANK YOU SIR I REALLY APPRECIATE IT I I'D BE HAPPY OFF LINE. I KNOW YOU IT WERE OTHERWISE VISIONS TO MAJORITY LEADER AND I I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE EVEN BECAUSE AND ARE TOUGH THAT JOB IS. I I CAN ADDRESS IT BECAUSE ALL I CAN SHARE WITH YOU IS THAT. WE LOOKED AT THE LAW THE LAW AND AND EVEN THOUGH THE OUR OTHER SIDES ARGUING RETROACTIVITY WHEN YOU DECLARE THE INTENT IT'S NOT RETROACTIVITY THE ONLY WAY TO GET A RECTOR ACTIVITY AT ALL SURE THIS OTHER MEMBERS TO DRESS THE SENSITIVITY. IS IF YOU SAY THIS IS RETROACTIVE A DECLARATION IS ONLY ADVICE TO COURTS TO FOR CONSIDERATION AND THEY CAN LISTEN OR NOT LISTEN AND IT'S A STATEMENT ABOUT HOW WE WANT TO COMPORT OURSELVES ALSO ALLEGES THAT WOULD YOU OFF LINE. BUT I JUST WANTED TO THIS ISSUE SPOTTER BUT APPENDED VOICE SIR THANK YOU SO KINDLY SENT OUT. AN ARM OF THE BILL. WE HAVE -- OTHER MEMBERS WHO LIKE TO QUESTION MISTER VOEPEL I AM. NOT AN ATTORNEY BUT I DO HAVE AN INSURANCE BACKGROUND NOW IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING. THAT THE BAIL BOND. AND THE IMMIGRATION BONDS ART INSURANCE PRODUCT [inaudible] DID [inaudible] THE PLAINTIFFS. PUT IN A FORMAL COMPLAINT TO THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER. I HAVE NO IDEA. I DON'T KNOW THE FACTS OF THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WORK ON THE QUESTION IS THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE INSURANCE PART THAT'S THE IMPORTANT POINT. IS A MISTER VOEPEL IT DIDN'T SOME OF A TELL THEM THE ISSUE IS I DON'T I I'M I'M SAYING I'M EXEMPTING THEM I'M SAYING THAT I'M TAKING AN AMENDMENT WHATEVER I JUST SAID. BUT I'M WILLING TO TAKE THAT WOULD BASICALLY EXEMPT THE INSURANCE BECAUSE IT'S NOT LOOKING AT THE INSURANCE PRODUCT AND THE INSURANCE COMPANY SPECIFICALLY IN THEIR CONTRACTS SAY. DON'T COME BACK TO US IF YOU GUYS WANT A PAYMENT PLAN YOU DO THAT THAT'S A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT ONCE YOU GET TO A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT. YOU GET OUT OF THE RANGE OF BAIL INDUSTRY IT'S NOT A BAIL IT'S JUST A TYPICAL CONSUMER. CONTRACT FOR FINANCING LIKE YOUR FINANCING REFRIGERATOR AT SEARS UNDERSTOOD AG SO IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT AND I SAID THIS DOESN'T APPLY TO THEM SO I'M NOT EVEN GOING THERE. LET'S SEE I GO WITH THEIR ARGUMENT BECAUSE THIS IS AN INSURANCE PRODUCT IT IS UNDER THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER. AND THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER HAS TO UP STRINGENTLY APPROVED VARIOUS CONTRACTS ANY CONSUMER THE COMPLAINTS TO THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER ABOUT A CONTRACT. LET ME TELL YA THOSE THAT HOLD LICENSE THEY QUIVER IN THEIR SHOES BECAUSE YOU DO NOT WANT TO CALIFORNIA INSURANCE COMMISSIONER COMING IN ON YOU. SO. MAYBE IT'S MY MIND SET FROM THE INDUSTRY BUT I'M LOOKING AT THIS AS PURELY AN INSURANCE PRODUCT. AND INSURANCE PRODUCTS ARE NOT CONSIDERED -- GOODS OR SERVICES THIS IS THE FINANCIAL SERVICES PRODUCTS. BECAUSE THERE'S BRINGING PEOPLE OUT OF JAIL. AND THAT IS A MONEY MATTER THAT'S THE LOGIC IN THE THE THE BUILD BUSINESS SO. CALM I WAS PROBABLY GOING AYE AYE IN A START OKAY SAY ONE THING SO NOW LET'S ASSUME THAT THERE'S A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS BAIL. LET'S ASSUME THAT -- ABC BILL COMPANY COMES IN AND GIVES BAD BOY UP UP THE SURETY BOND FOR THE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND THEY CHARGE THE BILL BAD BOY A THE TEN THOUSAND RPM IN THE TRUCK AND TWENTY THREE BOX. NOW BAD BOY GOES OUT AND GET IN ON THE GUY THERE TO TAKE IT OUT MISTER HERTZBERG ENABLE PAYMENT PLAN WITH ME. IF I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PAYMENT PLAN WITH BAD BOY AND THE I'VE I'VE BEHIND ON MY PAYMENTS. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN I SKIP. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE COURT AND THE INSURANCE PRODUCT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO PAY THAT. THE ONLY THING I CARE ABOUT IS WHETHER MR HERTZBERG IS MAKING pENGAGE IN BEHAVIOR AND HOW I CAN BREAK DOWN PEOPLE'S DOORS IF YOU'RE IT SAYS IN HIS CONTRACT IF YOU'RE COHABITATING WITH SOMEBODY. ANYBODY WHO COULD CAPITATED YOU AGREES TO BE SEARCHED IN SEASON HAVE THEIR PROPERTY SEIZED I MEAN IT'S JUST VIOLATIVE OF EVERY PRINCIPLE AND SO I ONLY CARE ABOUT THAT PIECE SO YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THE INSURANCE PRODUCT. BUT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES INVOLVED THIS IS ABOUT IT FINANCIAL INSTALLMENT CONTRACT BECAUSE THESE THINGS ARE SO EXPENSIVE AND WE SEE THAT SHIFT. AND SO WHAT I RESPECT YOUR EXPERIENCE IN THE LIKE I JUST WANTED TO PUT THAT FINER POINT IF IT'S HELP JUNE CONSIDERATION. TRAFFIC. ALL RIGHT -- MISTER COOPER. WAS NEXT. THEN -- IN ORDER TO OF AND THEN MISTER MAYES SURE SENATOR ACTUALLY COLLEAGUES ISSUES OR CONCERNS REGARDING RETROACTIVITY. AND I THINK THE THE Y. L. FROM THE ROOM WOMEN DISCUSSING BILL FOR WHAT A YEAR YEAR AND A HALF NOW WE'VE HAD SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS. AND IS STILL COMES BACK TO THE REASON WHEN THIS DILEMMA IS BECAUSE THE JUDGES. YOU FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES FIFTY A DIFFERENT BILL SCHEDULES DOES MEET EVERY TWO YEARS. THE CHARGER ROBBERY ONE COUNTY IT'S TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. ANOTHER COUNTY IS TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT'S REALLY BEEN THE BIG ISSUE IS THE JUDGES YOUR PROPONENTS NEVER TALKED ABOUT THAT AND THAT'S A THE COMMUTE EASILY REMEDIED. SO THAT THAT'S MY FRUSTRATION THIS IS A SEPARATE BILL BUT THE JUDGES IN ABOUT TWO THOUSAND ONE OR TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE BILL'S DOUBLE. FOR LOVE THE BILL SCHEDULE BECAUSE THE JUDGES. THE JUDGES HAVE WITH IN THIS DILEMMA. THAT'S NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IN A HAS IMAGE I NEVER HEARD IT MISSED FROM ANYBODY'S MOUTH IN THE PORT IS THE MATERIAL THEIR EMAILS. THEIR ADVERTISEMENTS AND THAT'S YOU KNOW WE REALLY NEED TO START WITH A LOWER THESE BILLS THROUGH THE JUDGES. BUT IF THE CALIPHATE IS SCHEDULES THAT THAT'S INSANE. SO HOPEFULLY YOU KNOW THAT MY BIG ISSUE TODAY IS THE RETRO. WELL I WAS SAYING IS THAT I JUST WANNA MAKE IT CLEAR AND I'M HAPPY TO SHARE THE LANGUAGE OF THE COMMITTEE FROM LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL AND I CAN GIVE YOU EXAMPLES OF BILLS WHICH THEY GAVE ME. AND BASICALLY. IT'S NOT RETRO IT'S NOT RETRO. THE LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL SAYS IF IT'S GOING TO BE RETRO IT HAS TO SAY THIS SECTION SHALL APPLY RETROACTIVELY THERE'S NO WORDS IN THE BILL THAT'S A RETRO. THE COURT CASES THAT I SAID IF YOU MENTION DISPOSITIVE AS JIMMY GOMEZ DID IN HIS BILL INVOLVING IMMIGRANT KIDS ARE I DIDN'T REPRESENTING AND WORKING ON BEHALF OF THE UP. AND A BILL I DIDN'T TWO THOUSAND ONE IN THE TRIAL LAWYERS SAID -- YOU'RE GOING RETRO HEAR THIS ALL THE TIME. THE ABILITY IS TO GIVE GUIDANCE AS TO WHAT THE CURRENT INTENTION THE LEGISLATURE IS THE COURTS AND COURTS CAN JUST TAKE IN THE CONSIDERATION DECIDE OR NOT. AND TO ME WHEN THESE KINDS OF ISSUES ARE BEFORE YOU BY NOT MAKING A STATEMENT AS TO THE AND JUSTICE YOU ARE MAKING A STATEMENT WHEN YOU LET IT PASS YOUR YOUR FEET AND YOU SAY I'M NOT GOING TO SAY ANYTHING THAT'S THEIR RESPONSIBILITY. I'M SORRY I THINK WE'VE GOT A RESPONSIBILITY THAT'S WHY I'M DOING THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF THE MANSON FAMILY TAKING ARE UP TO AYE DOING TO AMENDMENTS ONE IS THE TAKING AMENDMENT. TO BE THE AND SECONDLY I'M HAPPY TO TAKE IT AMENDMENT THAT SAID WHAT I SAY THIS BILL DOES NOT APPLY TO INSURANCE SLASH SURETIES SO BUT THE ISSUE IS A WIN FOR TO REMEMBER SPEAK ON THE ISSUE OF RETROACTIVE I DON'T BECAUSE IT'S OLD TO ME IT'S JUST. VERY TAKING HIM ON THAT OR NOT I'M NOT GONNA TAKE IT BECAUSE BECAUSE IT'S NOT TRUE. I CAN'T SUPPORT IT OKAY CAN I GET IT BUT IT'S JUST NOT TRUE IT'S JUST A SCAM BECAUSE THE INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE TO PROTECT THEIR BILL PEOPLE AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING I JUST CALL IT AS I SEE IT. I'M GONNA BE ASKING THE STAFF TO COMMENT ON THAT VERY POINT -- BECAUSE VIEW SENATOR HERTZBERG DISAGREE WITH THE LOGIC RATIONALE FOR AMENDMENT A YOU -- AND I WANT BUT I WANT TO GIVE THE STAFF WHO WROTE THE ANALYSIS A CHANCE TO COMMENT. AND IF WITH I KNOW COUPLER COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAD QUESTIONS BUT WE AYE AIRED I SHOULD HAVE ALLOWED THE SUPPORTERS TO SPEAK. AND GIVE THEM THEIR SHOT AND THEN WE'LL HEAR FROM OPPONENTS THEN WE'LL COME BACK TO COMMITTEE ALL RIGHT. OKAY -- SO. SENATOR IF YOU WANT YOUR WITNESSES TO WAIT TO WEIGH IN THIS IS THEIR OPPORTUNITY GO AHEAD. FINALLY -- MY NAME IS DAN AYKROYD ARNELLE I AM AN ATTORNEY AT LAWYERS COMMITTEE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS IN SAN FRANCISCO -- OF WHERE WE STARTED THE FIRST FREE LEGAL SEAT SERVICES CLINIC TO HELP PEOPLE WHO HAVE BAIL BONDS THAT AND ARE EXPERIENCING ALL KINDS OF DIFFICULTIES IN THEIR LIVES BECAUSE OF THAT DEBT. AND WE HAVE COUNCIL OVER A HUNDRED PEOPLE IN THE LAST YEAR ON EXACTLY THESE ISSUES. HELPING THEM UNDERSTAND BOTH THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE CONTRACTS BUT THEIR RIGHTS THEIR CONSUMER RIGHTS IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY ARE THE CONSUMER OF A SERVICE SO. I I HEAR ALL OF THE CONCERNS AND WITH REGARDS TO THIS BEING ABOUT INSURANCE. IT'S NOT THE ONLY ASPECT OF THESE TRANSACTIONS THAT HAVE BETTER INSURANCE ARE BETWEEN THE BAIL COMPANIES AND THE COURTS BETWEEN THE BILL COMPANY AND OUR CLIENTS IT'S A SERVICE THEY'RE PAYING FOR THE SERVICE OF THEM POSTING THAT SURELY BOND. WITH THE COURT. AND SO [inaudible] I GUESS. THE BOTTOM LINE IS REALLY THAT IF WE'RE TAKING THE POSITION THAT THESE LAWS DON'T APPLY TODAY. THEN WE'RE TAKING THE POSITION THAT NO AGE AND SPECIFIC CONDUCT THAT THESE CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS SEEK TO REGULATE. THAT'S BECAUSE THE INSURANCE REGULATIONS ARE ENTIRELY SILENT ON MANY OF THESE ISSUES THEY SAY NOTHING ABOUT THE FINANCING OF THE PREMIUMS. ARE PAYMENT PLANS OR DEBT COLLECTION SO IF THESE LAWS OF THE CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS DON'T APPLY. THEN NO LAWS APPLY THAT'S WHAT WILL THAT'S WHAT THIS MEANS IF WE IF WE DON'T THINK THESE LAWS APPLY RIGHT NOW. BEEN THERE'S NOTHING THAT REGULATES THOSE ACTIVITIES WITH EIGHT WHICH THEY ROUTINELY ENGAGE CHEN -- SO. THEY WILL GET TO EXTEND CREDIT WITHOUT FOLLOWING ANY OF THE LAWS THAT REGULATE THE EXTENSION OF CREDIT ISN'T IT A ISN'T THAT EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE LITIGATING IN COURT ARE THOSE POINTS. THE ONE ISSUE IN THE ELITE CASE IN THAT HAS ANY OVERLAP WITH THIS BILL IS WHETHER OR NOT THE PAYMENT PLAN COULD BE CONSIDERED TO BE. A CONSUMER CREDIT CONTRACT. BAD JUDGE FOUND. THAT IT DOES BUT WE'RE NOT LITIGATING WHETHER OR NOT FAIR NEXT THAT COLLECTION PRACTICES ACT SUPPLY OR THE CONSUMER LEGAL REMEDIES ACT OR THE CONTRACT TRANSLATION ACT. I HAVE BEEN IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE BAIL BOND INDUSTRY THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS ABOUT THEIR NEED TO FOLLOW THESE LAWS WHEN THEY PROVIDE SERVICES TO LOW INCOME CONSUMERS AND THEY EXTEND CREDIT TO THEM. AND THEY JUST ROUTINELY TELL ME THEY DON'T HAVE TO FALL THOSE LAWS. BUT THERE'S NO OTHER LAWS THAT REGULATE THAT BEHAVIOR. SO. WITH THAT I'D I URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. IN THE MORNING DANIEL CANDOR KAISER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CONSUMER COALITION CLICK. WE ARE ALL THE ALSO THE CO SPONSORS OF THE BILL. OUR OUR MEMBERS ARE MORE THAN A DOZEN LEGAL SERVICES PROVIDERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND WE WORK WITH THOUSANDS OF LOW INCOME CONSUMERS EVERY YEAR. AND FAR TOO MANY OF OUR CLIENTS HAVE HAD TO DEAL WITH THE NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES THE BAIL BOND INDUSTRY -- THIS IS AN INDUSTRY THAT SEEMS TO BELIEVE THAT IT DOES NOT NEED TO FOLLOW. THE RULES THAT EVERY OTHER BUSINESS IN THE STATE NEEDS TO FOLLOW -- SB. THREE EIGHTEEN OZ THE SENATOR SAID IS NOT A RETRO ACTIVE BILL -- I WISH THAT THIS BILL WERE NOT NECESSARY IF THE BILL BONDS COMPANIES WERE ENGAGING IN BEHAVIOR THAT WAS ILLEGAL. THAT IS YOU THEY ARE ENGAGING IN ILLEGAL CURRENT CONSUMER PROTECTION LAW BEHAVIOR. AND IF THAT WASN'T THE CASE THE BILL WOULD NOT BE NEEDED IF THE BOND COMPANIES WEREN'T CALLING CONSUMERS AT ALL HOURS OF THE NIGHT TO COLLECT DEBTS OR NEGOTIATING CONTRACTS IN SPANISH. BUT PROVIDING DIFFERENT TERMS IN WRITTEN ENGLISH VERSION OR REPRESENTING THE SERVICES TO PROVIDE THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH A SPELL. THEY WOULD NOT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL THE CLEAREST SIGN THAT THE BILL IS NECESSARY IS HOW HARD THE COMPANIES ARE FIGHTING IT. THIS IS A CLARIFICATION OF EXISTING LAW WE URGE YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND LET'S GO TO THE AUDIENCE OTHER. PERSONS WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. JUST YOUR NAME AND YOUR POSITION PLEASE MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MIKE A DOCTOR OFF ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIANS STRONG SUPPORT. FOLLOWING WITH A ASIAN AMERICANS ADVANCING JUSTICE CALIFORNIA AND WE SUPPORT. THE MORNING DEEPENING AGNETHA CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER IN STRONG SUPPORT. I KNOW YOU'RE A SCHOOL WHICH ALLOWED THE COALITION FOR HUMANE IMMIGRANT RIGHTS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO SPEAK IN FAVOR [inaudible] OF THEN LET'S GO TO OPPONENTS. OF THE BILL. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY IN SO THESE. THE OTHER TWO GENTLEMAN. WE'LL BE HERE AT THE TABLE AND THEN -- OR LOOKS LIKE A THIRD. AND THEN WILL. OFFER AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ANYONE ELSE TO ADD ON AS AN OPPOSE. GO AHEAD SIR MARK SEGMENT WITH THE AMERICAN PROPERTY CASH ANSWERS ASSOCIATION AND THE SHIRT INFIDELITY ASSOCIATION -- I ALWAYS HATE TO OPPOSE A HERTZBERG BILL BECAUSE I FIND IT TO BE AN EXHAUSTING EXPERIENCE -- BUT LIKELY HE DOESN'T HAVE MY CELL PHONE NUMBER SO WE COULD NOT CALLED ME AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK LAST NIGHT -- I THINK THE DEBATE THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS HAD IN THE DEBATE THAT THAT WOULD HAVE LEGISLATURE I THINK IT'S VERY CLEAR WHAT WE HAVE WE HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL GOING FORWARD IF THESE ARE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THAT NEED TO BE IMPOSED ON THEIR CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THAT SHOULD BE. IMPOSED. AND THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONSIDER EACH ONE OF THEM INDIVIDUALLY AS TO WHETHER NOT THEY ARE APPROPRIATE WE DO HOWEVER HAVE A HUGE ISSUE WITH THE LANGUAGE THAT WE BELIEVE. MAKES THIS RETROACTIVE BECAUSE IF THE LAW PASSES ON JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY AND BECOMES EFFECTIVE. THAN ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED BEFORE THAT THIS SHOULD HAVE COMPLIED WITH THE LAWS THAT NOBODY UNDERSTANDS THAT ARE THERE. THAT'S WHY WE FEELS RETROACTIVE AS YOU KNOW. BOTH THE SURETIES SIDE OF IT AND THE BAILEY TO SIDE OF IT IS HEAVILY REGULATED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. I USED TO LOVE THE DAVE JONES USED TO BRAG THAT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CHARTS WAS THE LARGEST CONSUMER PROTECTION AGENCY IN THE WORLD. THEY HAVE NEVER IMPOSE THESE REQUIREMENTS A BAIL AGENTS BECAUSE I BELIEVE I'M NOT SPEAK FOR THEM BUT I BELIEVE THEY DON'T PUT THINK FACING SUPPLIES SO. IF THESE CONSERVE REDUCTIONS ARE NECESSARY IN A BAIL CONTENTS THAT'S FINE GOING FORWARD WE MIGHT NEED A LITTLE DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION DATE SURE THAT EVERYBODY HAS THE PROPER FORMS. AND EVERYTHING THAT IS CORRECTLY BUT TO INTERJECT. THESE REQUIREMENTS AND MAKE THEM IN ESSENCE RETROACTIVE SPECIALLY WAS THE AS THE COMMITTEE HAS NOTED THERE ARE SEVERAL PENDING COURT CASES. JUST DOES NOT SEEM TO BE APPROPRIATE THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT A NEXT. TO WITNESS. MY NAME IS -- JOHN LARA BY MEN ATTORNEY I'VE WORKED IN THE DEFENDING BOTH BAIL AGENTS CHARITIE AND TO THE INDEMNITY -- IS FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND COURT CASES REGARDING BAIL FORFEITURES AND WHAT I THINK IS OFTEN MISSED WHENEVER -- THIS -- MATTERS ARE LOOK AT IS THAT THE ONLY WAY THE BAIL AGENTS OR EFFECTIVE IS BEING COOPERATING WITH THE INDEMNITY. THE JOB THAT THEY'RE GIVEN IS TO MAKE SURE THE DEFENDANT GOES TO COURT AND AND THE WAY THE BAY ALLEGIANCE TO THAT IS THAT THERE. DALY AGENT AND THE FAMILY ARE BOTH OBLIGATED TO PAY A PENALTY IF THE DEFENDANT FAILS TO GO TO COURT AND THAT CAUSES BOTH THE BAIL AGENT IN THE INDEMNITY -- TO BE IN A COOPERATIVE POSITION TO GET THE DEFENDANTS TO COURT AND THAT'S WHY BAIL BRING SO MANY PEOPLE BACK -- IS THAT COOPERATION THAT THEY HAVE IN THE RELATIONSHIP NOW WHAT'S HAPPENED AS BEEN DISCUSSED EARLIER IS THAT THE BAIL RATES HAVE BEEN INCREASED DRAMATICALLY. AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE NEED TO TO FINANCE THE PREMIUMS BAIL AGENTS DON'T WANT TO FINANCE PREMIUMS BAIL AGENTS HAVE ALWAYS WHEN I STARTED IN THE EARLY NINETIES CERTAINLY. THEY GOT PAID THEIR PREMIUMS AND THEN THEY WORRIED ABOUT TRYING TO SECURE THE PENALTY IF THE DEFENDANT FAILED TO APPEAR. BUT AS THE BAIL SCHEDULES OF CONTINUE TO INCREASE PEOPLE SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PAY THESE PREMIUMS AND THEREFORE THEY'VE HAD TO COME UP WITH A FINANCING. NOW AT THIS POINT THAT PROCESS OF SETTING BAIL IS ALREADY BEEN FOUND UNCONSTITUTIONAL BY THE STATE COURTS BY THE FEDERAL COURTS AND BY AND AND ADMITTED BUYER LAST TO ATTORNEY GENERAL'S. THAT PROCESS THE INJUNCTION IN SAN FRANCISCO AGAINST THE IMPOSITION OF AS THE FEDERAL COURT FOUND PUTTING RANDOM NUMBERS NEXT PENAL CODE SECTIONS IS IS ALREADY UNDER WAY. AND I BELIEVE THAT WHEN THE WHEN THAT IS RESOLVE THE AMOUNTS OF BAIL WILL GO BACK TO A NORMAL AMOUNT AND OF THE THE FINANCING AND OTHER ISSUES. ARE SIMPLY UNNECESSARY THE SYSTEM THAT -- MISTER HERTZBERG. RIFF LÃ  REPLIED TO WITH HIS FATHER WHERE YOU WOULD JUST POST THE TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS -- I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'LL GET BACK TO THAT BUT THE COURTS CAN ONLY IMPOSE THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF BAIL NECESSARY TO SIR LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT PURPOSES. AND THEY HAVEN'T BEEN FOLLOWING THAT STANDARD AND WHEN THEY DO A LOT OF THESE PROBLEMS ARE SIMPLY GOING TO DISAPPEAR. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN CHANGE THE RELATIONSHIP OF JUST THE BAIL AGENTS AND TO THE CONSUMER BAIL AGENTS CAN ONLY WORK AS REPRESENTATIVES OF INSURANCE COMPANIES UNDER INSURANCE CODE SECTION. EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND THAT'S BEEN THE CONSISTENT LAW THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT SINCE IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AND THE GROWS VERSE LOS ANGELES DECISION SO THERE YOU YOU THAT THE IDEA OF SEPARATING THESE TWO ENTITIES IS NOT POSSIBLE THEY ARE THE SAME ENTITY -- THE YEAH AND AND YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND -- IN THE THE CONTEXT OF THE BAIL CONTRACT IS CUSTODIAL THE DEFENDANTS ARE ARE BEING RELEASED FROM. CUSTODY NOT ENOUGH OF THEM QUITE FRANKLY THEY SHOULD BE MORE RELEASE AND SO SOME OF THE THE THE THE OBJECTIONS THAT MR HERTZBERG CAST ON THE CUSTODIAL NATURE OF SOME OF THESE CONTRACTS. THAT'S THE NECESSARY AT IT HELPS THE INDEMNITY -- WHAT THE INDEMNITY -- HAS TO AVOID AMONGST ALL THINGS IS HAVING TO PAY THE FORFEITURE FOR THE DEFENDANT TO FAILING TO APPEAR. AND THAT WHAT THAT RELATIONSHIP IS THE CORE OF THE BAIL AGREEMENT I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE BAILEY CHEN INDEMNITY -- RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT IS THE REAL REASON THE BAILIFF SO EFFECTIVE AT ITS THAT COOPERATION BETWEEN BAIL AGENTS ON THE INDEMNITY. IN. VERY MUCH THE THE IT'S VERY CULTURALLY ORIENTED THE YOU TEND TO HAVE BAIL AGENTS WORKING WITHIN THEIR OWN CULTURES SO THAT THEY DO UNDERSTAND. AND THAT THE THE THE PROBLEMS THAT -- HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP IN RELATION TO THE CONSUMERS HAVE TO DO WITH TRYING BOTH THE BAIL AGENTS AND THE CONSUMERS TRYING TO COMPLY WITH EXCESSIVE BAIL THAT'S BEEN SET WITH THE COURTS THANK YOU SIR FOR THAT. INSIDE THE NEXT GO AHEAD SIR -- MIKE WHAT LUCK WITH AMERICAN SURE TO COMPANY WERE ADMITTED CARRIER YEAH IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I'M REALLY HERE FOR QUESTIONS BUT I WOULD SAY THAT OUR OUR FORMS ALL FORMS -- USED BY. AGENT REPRESENTATIVES OF SURE TO COMPANY ARE APPROVED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. EVERY AGENTS WHEN THEY'RE APPOINTED THEY SIGNED A DOCUMENT THAT SAYS I WILL USE THESE FORMS ARE PROVIDED BY THE DEPARTMENT INSURANCE SO IF THERE'S AN ISSUE WITH THE FORMS BEING USED BY BILL AGENTS. IN MY MIND THAT SHOULD BE IT IS TO ADDRESS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THOSE -- FORMS NEED TO BE CHANGED. THANK YOU SIR -- IN. WE'LL BE AVAILABLE -- TO ANSWER QUESTIONS IF THERE ARE QUESTIONS OTHER PERSONS AGAINST THE BILL GO AHEAD GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MANY CAPPING LUNCH REPRESENTING GOLDEN STATE BAIL AGENTS ASSOCIATION -- WERE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED WE WOULD BE OKAY WITH THIS BILL BEING PROSPECTIVE INCLUDING THOSE LANGUAGES GOING FORWARD THANK YOU. WHEN IT WAS TERRIBLE BUT A LITTLE BIT AVAIL AGENT FOR THIRTY SIX YEARS MY FATHER GREG PUT A LOT -- FOR FORTY I AM AVAIL AGENT AND I AM THE FURTHEST THING FROM A PREDATORY LENDER. WE WORK WITH FAMILIES WE WORK THE DEFENDANTS TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF JAIL SO THE WHOLE CONNOTATION OF WHAT IS BEING REPRESENTED HERE MAY BE REPRESENTATIVE OF ONE CASE. MAYBE TWO BUT THE FACT OF MATTER AS IS ALLUDED TO EARLIER. OUR INDUSTRY IS AN EFFECTIVE INDUSTRY WE WORK WITH PEOPLE IN THEIR FINANCIAL NEEDS SO I I DO FIND GREAT. FAULT IN THE ARGUMENT BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE IN THE OTHER COMMITTEE. THIS IS NOT ABOUT THIS HE ALREADY DEALT WITH THIS NICE BETWEEN SO I DO FIND GREAT FAULT AND THE ARGUMENT IS BEING PRESENTED TO THIS COMMITTEE. THANK YOU SIR OTHER PERSONS WISHING TO SPEAK AGAINST THE BILL. I GUESS MY NAME IS GLORIA MITCHELL -- MY OWN GLORY MITCHELL BILL ONES I AM A SECOND GENERATION AND MY FAMILY HAS ALWAYS BEEN -- THEY'RE WILLING TO ASSIST AND HELP ALL -- CLIENTS THAT COME IN AND GUIDE THEM TO MAYBE EVEN A MORE APPROPRIATE A DECISION IN BEFORE MAKING THAT FINAL DECISION TO DO BAIL. I AM ALSO HERE REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA BAILEY GINS ASSOCIATION AS OUR PRESIDENT AND THAT WE STRONGLY OPPOSE. AND HOPEFULLY SOME CHANGES COULD BE MADE THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING -- I'M NOT OPPOSING IT AS IT IS PRESENTED HERE -- I'M A A MOM AND POP. OF STORE OUT OF SAN FRANCISCO. AND THE LITIGATION THAT HAS BEEN -- IT HELD OUT OF SAN FRANCISCO THE BAIL SCHEDULE WILK SILENTLY ALL OF A SUDDEN ABOUT THREE MONTHS AGO. THE BAIL SCHEDULE DROPPED TO ABOUT ONE THIRD SO THERE IS. A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF FINANCING THAT HAS TO BE DONE AND IT'S NOT A LOT OF HIGH HIGH BILLS AS IF YOU COULD ADDRESS THE BILL PLEASE AND THANK YOU. SO YOU'RE AGAINST THE BILL JUST TO CLARIFY I I USE THAT OPPOSED THANK YOU GOOD THANK YOU. ANY OTHER PERSONS WISHING TO SPEAK AGAINST THE BILL. IF THERE COULD I MAKE ONE MORE POINT. WE'LL BRING IT BACK NOW TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS AND PLEASE GO AHEAD SIR IF YOU HAVE A POINT I KEEP HEARING THE WORD FINANCING WITH RELATED TO PREMIUM REALLY AGENTS ARE NOT ALLOWED FINANCING INDICATES -- ISN'T PRESENT AND AGENTS CHARGING INTEREST ON THE BALLOT SEWING AND THERE IS NO INTEREST ON THE BALLOT SO IN PLEASE BILL ONE FRAME INTO A SET HIM UP ON PAYMENT TERMS. THE ONLY TIME INTEREST REALLY COMES INTO PLAY IS A BIG DEFAULTED ON THE PAYMENT TERMS THEY'VE GONE TO COURT ATTAINED A JUDGMENT AND THE WHICH THEY CAN CHARGE INTEREST AT THAT POINT SO THERE IS NO INTEREST CHARGES. CAN PAYMENT PLANS ON BUILT ON PRESENT YOU SIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS -- LÃ  MISS COMMA GRID OF YOU WERE NEXT IN THE QUEUE -- I WANTED TO EARLIER JUST -- APPLAUD SENATOR HERTZBERG FOR HIS -- SB ANNEKE BACKBONE AS IT RELATES TO THIS -- ISSUE AND THIS BILL I AM -- I'VE ENJOYED THIS CONVERSATION QUITE THOROUGHLY. I WANT TO SAY THAT I WILL BE -- SUPPORTING THIS -- BILL I THINK THERE ARE LEGAL KIND OF CONVERSATIONS AND DECISIONS AND THERE ARE POLICY CONVERSATIONS AND DECISIONS. AND I AM CERTAINLY LOOKING AT THIS THROUGH A POLICY LANDS -- I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS PART OF YOU KNOW THE LARGER ARMADA THAT YOU ARE LEADING -- IN THE EFFORT TOWARDS BAIL REFORM INTO HAVING A MORE EQUITABLE CONVERSATION AS IT RELATES TO YOU KNOW FINANCING -- THE FREEDOM OF DEFENDANTS AND KIND OF HOW WE PLACE THAT IN THE LARGER CONVERSATION OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND RESTORATIVE JUSTICE IS IMPORTANT THIS MAY BE A DOLLAR PART OF THAT LARGER CONVERSATION BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT. IF THERE ARE GOING TO BE LEGAL ATTACKS. LET THEM COME THAT IS WHY WE HAVE A COURT SYSTEM THAT IS WHY WE HAVE A STATE SUPREME COURT -- I AM SURE THAT THIS WILL NOT BE THE INDUSTRY'S LAST BITE AT THIS APPLE AND QUITE FRANKLY NOR SHOULD IT BE THERE IS SO MUCH MONEY. EMBEDDED IN THIS INDUSTRY THAT YOU SHOULDN'T STOP YOU SHOULD NOT STOP ATTACKING THE INTEGRITY AND THE ARGUMENTS IN THE BILL. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT IN THIS MOMENT IN TIME BAIL BONDSMAN'S IN THE AGENCIES IN THE INDUSTRIES DO PLAY A ROLE THAT FOLKS DO STILL NEED. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE STATUS QUO IS WORKING FOR EVERYONE AND TO A LARGE EXTENT IT IS THEREFORE A CERTAIN SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION. THE JAMELLE AS THE REFUSE THE HOBBY YEARS THE MISTER AND MRS JONES SAYS MANY OF WHOM ARE FOLKS THAT I KNOW. I AM APPLAUDING YOUR PERSISTENCE I THINK THERE CAN BE SOME YOU KNOW ADDITIONAL TWEAKS I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION WHY YOU'RE ADDED AMENDMENT OF SORT OF CLARIFYING THAT THIS IS NOT -- INVOLVING OR DOES NOT. APPLY DO NOT TRY TO THE INSURANCE AGENCIES IS ON REASONABLE. AND IF IT IS EITHER ON CLEAR OR NOT SPECIFIC ENOUGH -- IF BECAUSE I'D FEEL LIKE MAYBE I MISSED THE RESPONSE TO THAT -- BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT -- I WILL BE -- SUPPORTING THIS BILL. THANK YOU A COMMITTEE MEMBERS OTHER QUESTIONS. ON THE SUBJECT MISTER GRAYSON DO HAVE SOMETHING A YES I DO AND JUST. TO CLARIFY ONE MORE TIME -- YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE BILL IS NOT RETROACTIVE. YES SIR IS IT POSSIBLE THEN -- TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING WITHOUT SAYING. IN OTHER WORDS CAN YOU WORD THINGS IN A WAY THAT MAKE IT DO THINGS THAT YOU DIDN'T COME RIGHT OUT AND SAY THAT IT DOES SURE. ALL RIGHT I GOT A LOT TO DO THAT A LOT OF YOUR ALL RIGHT -- SO I JUST WANTED TO GO THERE I I DID WANT TO ASK OF ONE OF YOUR WITNESSES WHO HAD SAID THAT THEY HAD HEARD SO OR THAT YOU WOULD HELP OVER A HUNDRED PEOPLE. WHAT WAS THE OUTCOME -- IF YOU AS THE COURT AND THE JUDGE RULING IN YOUR FAVOR AND THE MAJORITY OF THOSE CASES. SO TO BE CLEAR I LIKE THIS PART OF MY JOB A LOT MORE THAN THE COURT PART AND I DO NOT -- CAM HAD WANDERED LITIGATE ANYTHING RIGHT AND SO FOR THE BESIDES THE CASE THAT'S ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED WHICH ACTUALLY STARTED BECAUSE BAD BOYS BAIL BOND SUIT ON THAT THAT WE DID NOT BRING THAT CASE. TO A RICH ORIGINALLY -- I HAVE NOT FILED ANY OTHER CASE AS WE HELP LOW INCOME CONSUMERS WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO ATTORNEY IS WE SEND DEMAND LETTERS TO BAIL BONDS INFORMING THEM THAT WE BELIEVE THAT THEY VIOLATED ALL OF THESE LAWS. THEY GENERALLY. CHOOSE TO SETTLE WITH US AND WE DON'T WE'VE NEVER FILED ANYTHING IN A COURT AFFIRMATIVE WAY OKAY TO BEGIN WITH -- BUT THEN BUT THEY RESPOND EVERY SINGLE TIME SAYING THAT THESE LAWS DON'T APPLY TO THEM. OKAY I DO WANT TO SAY. I HAVE NEVER SEEN INTEREST BEING CHARGED SO I AGREE THE FINANCING BUT THEY DO REFER TO IT AS CREDIT BAIL. SO IT IS THE EXTENSION OF CREDIT. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU YOU ARE A HUMAN ERROR OF OTHER QUESTIONS GO AHEAD IF I MAY GO AHEAD -- INTO IT INTERESTING THANK YOU FOR HELPING MY PERSPECTIVE THERE IN THE MOST RECENT COURT CASE THE WORLD OF THAT WE ALL THAT HAS BEEN MADE REFERENCE -- TO THE JUDGE DID MAKE A RULING WAS THAT RULING IN FAVOR OF YOUR CASE. IN THE MIKE YEAH A LOT OF THE THE JUDGE FOUND THAT THE PREMIUM. FINANCING AGREEMENT THE CREDIT BAIL AGREEMENT WAS A CONSUMER CREDIT CONTRACT SO IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT THE THAT. THE JUDGE -- IS SEEING THE INTENT OF EXISTING LAW AND MADE A RULING. IN FAVOR OF WHAT MAYBE THIS BILL IS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH IN A RETROACTIVE WAY. THE JUDGE OF THE THE THE LAW WAS CLEAR BUT THE POINT IS EVEN THOUGH THE LAW IS CLEAR IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE LAW PROHIBITS AND YOU LOOK AT THE ACTIONS OF THE BAIL BONDS INDUSTRY. IT IS CLEAR THAT THEY ARE VIOLATING THE LAWS WITH THE SPECIFIC CONTACT WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT THEY'VE ALWAYS ENGAGED IN THAT CONDUCT SO RETROACTIVITY IS NOT. A PART OF THE DISCUSSION BUT WHEN THEY ENGAGE IN SPECIFIC CONDUCT THAT THESE LAWS OUTLAW. BAY ARE SUBJECT TO THOSE LAWS WHICH IS WHAT THE JUDGE SAID BUT THE THE POINT IS THAT THE BAIL BONDS INDUSTRY IS SAYING THAT THE LAWS DON'T APPLY TO THEM. ALRIGHT SO AS CENTER HERTZBERG -- IF I MAY ADD JUST AND I'LL TRY TO WRAP IT UP HERE I KNOW TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE -- CENTER HERTZBERG. IS THERE OF A POSSIBLE WAY BECAUSE WE'RE HEARING DIFFERENCES OF OPINION WE'RE HEARING YOU CLEARLY CLEARLY SAY. THAT -- IT'S NOT RETROACTIVE THAT LEAD COUNSEL ACTUALLY SAYS THAT IN ORDER FOR TO BE RETROACTIVE YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY USE THE WORD DIRECTIVE AND THE WORD CORRECT RESTAURANT IN YOUR BILL. SO WE HEAR THAT BEING SAID WE ALSO HEAR OTHERS THAT ARE TESTIFYING -- THAT -- THE THE WORDING ITSELF IS IS MAKING IT RETROACTIVE S THERE ANY WAY IF THE COURTS ARE ALREADY SEEING IT. THE WAY YOU'RE WANTING TO TO MOVE THIS BILL FORD IS THERE ANYWAY WE WE WE COULD DRAW A LINE IN THE SAND. AND MOVE YOUR EFFORTS GOING FORWARD -- AND THEN LET THAT BE THE MESSAGE. TO JUDGES AND COURT CASES. SAYING BY CODIFYING WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IN LAW SAYING THIS IS WHAT. SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE WHOLE TIME. AND THIS IS WHAT WE'RE CODIFYING AS WE BELIEVE HAS EXISTED THE WHOLE TIME YUP I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH GOOD SOUL HOWEVER TO MAKE A COMMENT LET ME CHECK ONE OF THE FOR THE FIGHT I'M HAVING AND WHY I'M. HERE BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A POLICY QUESTION THIS IS A POLITICAL QUESTION. THIS IS A BUSINESS QUESTION THIS IS THE INSURANCE FOLKS WHO I'M WILLING TO EXEMPT HAVE TO ALIGN WITH THEIR CUSTOMERS. THISIS GOOD PEOPLE COMING TO TESTIFY THAT SAYS WE DON'T ENGAGE IN THIS BEHAVIOR BUT YOU HAVE BAD BOY PEOPLE FILING DOCUMENTS SAYING THIS DOESN'T APPLY. YOU HAVE INDUSTRIES OF CONTRACTS AND SO WHAT WHAT WE DO THE PURPOSE OF THE LAW I IS NEVER TO HELP THE PEOPLE WHO ALWAYS DO THE GOOD STUFF. THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE GOOD IT'S TO ENFORCE AGAINST THE BAD STUFF LET ME JUST SHARE WITH YOU AS TO WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET SPECIFIC TO THIS IS A SEVENTEEN PAGE ANALYSIS. IT PASSED OUT OF THE ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY COMMITTEE TEN ZERO TWO NOT VOTING OKAY. IT YOU'RE NOW SAYS THREE PAGES THAT ONE PAGE THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS THIS IS SEVENTEEN PAGES THEY WANT A BUNCH OF SMART LAWYERS WENT THROUGH ALL THE ARGUMENTS THAT WERE MADE AND SAID THIS IS BOGUS. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS IN OUR BUSINESS THE GROUPS COME IN ALL THE TIME TO PULL THE WOOL OVER OUR EYES THEY COME UP WITH FANCY WORDS THAT HAVE NO APPLICATION. THAT MEAN NOTHING SO I'M TELLING YOU YES I CAN WRITE IT BUT THEY'RE GOING TO OBJECT TO IT BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO PLAY IT BOTH WAYS ON THE ONE HAND THEY'RE TELLING US WE'RE GOOD PEOPLE. GREAT DOLLARS REPLIED YOU ON THE OTHER HAND THE FILED DOCUMENTS OTHERS JUST DOESN'T APPLY AND PLAY THE DUPLICITOUS GAME BECAUSE THEY WALK IN THIS BUILDING. AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS SO I COULD DRAFT THAT I GUARANTEE YOU BUT WHEN I DO IT BECAUSE LIKE I TOOK OUT ALL THE INTENT LANGUAGE THE STUFF I'M TAKING THAT IS A STICKING A FINGER IN THE EYE THE BILL MYSTERY BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THIS COMMITTEE DOES TO ME EVERY. TIME DON'T SAY ANYTHING BAD ABOUT THE BILL INDUSTRY AND THEY MAKE ME DO IT LAST YEAR THE DOING IT NOW. GREAT. I COULD WRITE THAT YOU'RE RIGHT BUT I GUARANTEE YOU WON'T GET ACCEPTED BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE DISCUSSING. THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE SO I AM IS A TRUE ANNA MISTER CHAIR ALL IN BUT THIS I DO SHARE WITH MY COLLEAGUE I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY A STATEMENT BY THE AUTHOR. WOULD NOT WORK WHEN IT COMES -- TO THE STATEMENT ABOUT NOT INVOLVING THE INSURERS OR THE BILLS AND FOR THE ASSURE ANY GROUPS OF BECAUSE THE STATE WAS MADE YOU CAN'T SEPARATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO SOME OF OUR GREAT AND WE DON'T WE THINK THAT THE RELATIONSHIP AS IT IS WITH ANY INSURANCE INDUSTRY. AGENT AND THE INSURANCE COMPANY THEY WORK FOR ITS TWO INTERRELATED TO SEPARATE ONE FROM THE OTHER. BUT IF YOU SAY IT'S NOT AN APPLY TO YOU IT MAY BE IN A RELATED BUT YOU JUST ARE OUT OF THE DEAL. THE PROBLEM YOU HAVE A COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CUSTOMER WHO'S THE BELLY CHEN AND YOU GOT TO PROTECT WHICH I UNDERSTAND I'M NOT OFFENDED BY IT. BUT I JUST THINK IT'S AN HONEST ANALYSIS. MISTER COOPER HAS ANOTHER POINT WANTS TO MAKE AND THEN WE'LL GO TO MR MAYES JR IS NEVER THIS COMMITTEE HAVE NEVER STUCK MY FINGER IN YOUR EYE CENTER WHICH YOU KNOW THAT. AND I THINK ALSO IF IT'S NOT CLEAR AND TO FIND A POLICY USERS OKAY. IT'S A BIT TOO INTERPRETATION THAT'S WE BIG ISSUE WITH THESE LAWS WE PATH WORK IS NOT CLEARLY DEFINED. HE WAS MAKE. CRAP UP. IN THEIR OWN WAY AND JUDGES SO MY BIG ISSUE IS KEEPING OVER OVER AGAIN IS NOT REDFIELD AND SPELL IT OUT AND THAT'S ULTIMATELY COMES DOWN TO JUST BUILD OUT YOU'RE NOT. AND IN IN THE FORM IT IS THIS SOLUTION TO PETITION BY JUDGES AND LAWYERS. SO -- MR CHU I THINK HAS TO LEAVE SO HE WANTS TO MAKE A QUICK COMMENT AND THEN WE'LL GO TO MR MAYES THANK YOU. THE TECHNICIAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MISTER CHAIR OF THE WALLACE THANK THE CENTER HERTZBERG FOR BRINGING THIS UP -- FOR I'M VERY CUMMINS -- THAT NONE OF US IN THIS ROOM MALIK THIS LAW TO BE READ RETROACTIVE. AND MR HERTZBERG. I AM VERY CONVINCED THAT -- THOUGH WHAT WAS THIS BILL MOVE FULL WERE DEAD YOU MORE WORK PLEASE STAY OPPOSITION TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO TO EVERYBODY THAT. WAS IN YOUR INTENT. AND THIS BILL TO TO MAKE IT RETROACTIVE AND ALSO I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY. I REALLY REALLY LOVE YOUR THE THAT THE STATE WOULD REQUIRE THE TRANSLATION THE LANGUAGE OF SENSIBILITY. IN THIS BILL SO -- I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY. THANK YOU. MR CHIU MISTER MAYES HAS BEEN WAITING PATIENTLY PLEASE GO AHEAD -- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- IT. AS WORD MOVING -- FOR WITH THIS -- I'VE ACTUALLY REALLY DO ENJOY THIS DEBATE FACT I THINK THAT THIS IS THE WAY THAT COMMITTEES SHOULD BE -- I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT THANK YOU MISTER -- OF COURSE I'VE GOT A GREAT AFFECTION FOR THE AUTHOR HE'S MY FRIEND -- AND OFTENTIMES WHEN -- FRIENDS COME BEFORE YOU YOU WANT TO GIVE THEM THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT -- BUT WE ALSO HAVE COMMITTEE -- IN THE WORK THAT THE COMMITTEES AND IS ALSO A FRIEND AND THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME DISAGREEMENT SO I WANT TO TRY TO GET SOME CLARITY I AM NOT AN ATTORNEY -- ABOUT 80% OF WHAT YOU ALL OF SAID -- ABOUT FOLKS UP HERE DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT SO I WANT TO TRY TO BOIL IT DOWN TO THE LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR IF WE CAN POSSIBLY. DO THAT I'M LOOKING AT THE SUMMARY -- IN THE ANALYSIS THAT WAS WRITTEN AND I ACTUALLY WANT TO BRING IT TO THE CONSOLE HERE IN A SECOND -- THERE ARE SEVEN ITEMS LISTED HERE. IN THE SUMMER WE CAN GO TO THE BILL BUT I'M JUST GONNA LOOK AT THE SUMMARY. AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE'S AGREEMENT ON NUMBER. NUMBER FOUR NUMBER FIVE AND THERE IS NO DISAGREEMENT ON GOING FORWARD ON THOSE ITEMS AT TH POLICY BEFORE US. IS A GOOD POLICY I THINK THAT'S WHAT I'VE HEARD THAT TODAY -- ALSO HAVE HEARD THAT SEVEN THAT YOU'RE THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE FIND ELIMINATE NUMBER SEVEN SO WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT NUMBER SIX IN THIS QUESTION OF WHAT IS. A DECLARATORY OF EXISTING LAW CORRECT WE HAD AN HEALTH COMMITTEE -- THIS JUST YESTERDAY AND IT MIGHT BE THE FIRST TIME IN MY FIVE YEARS THAT WE REALLY FOCUSED ON THIS ISSUE DE DECLARATORY OF EXISTING LAW. I WHETHER IT'S RETROACTIVE OR NOT THIS WAS IN REGARDS -- TO A BILL. I HAD DEFECTED HAVE ON HEALTH PLANS -- AND THERE THE HEALTH PLAN SAID IT WOULD THAT IS NOT EXISTING LONG OTHER SAID IT IS EXISTING LAW AND SO THERE IS A BILL THAT SAID WE'RE GONNA MAKE THIS EXISTING LAW OKAY -- IT'S SEEN HAPPEN IT SEEMS TO BE WELL I'D OF HAD HAVING TO LEAVE BECAUSE I GOT CALLED DOWN -- DOWN BELOW OF COURSE -- WITH -- WITH YOU -- SO I DO ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE END UP HAPPENING I'M GUESSING. WELL I'M GUESSING THE BILL MIGHT HAVE MOVE MIGHT HAVE MOVED FORWARD. I THAT THAT SO THAT. AND THE RIGHT WITH A GREAT DEAL OF THAT. WHICH IS OKAY BUT RIGHT SO THE QUESTION BEFORE US TODAY IS THAT OF WHAT IS RETROACTIVE AND IF NOT IF THE LAW IS WHAT THE LAW IS THERE SHOULD BE NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. SO WHY DO WE HAVE TO DECLARE THAT IT'S EXISTING LAW AND I'D ACTUALLY LIKE TO HEAR -- BECAUSE I HAVE NOT HEARD THIS GENTLEMAN IS THE ATTORNEY ARMS THE OPPOSITION SEEMS TO BE VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE OFTHIS I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM YOU I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE CONSULTANTS AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO HEAR -- FROM THE ATTORNEY ONE MORE TIME ON WILL WHY ISN'T THE LAW CLEAR AND WHY WOULD WE HAVE TO DECLARE IT TO BE SO IF IT ISN'T CLEAR ALREADY. WHAT THE THE AS IT'S BEEN SAID BAIL IS REGULATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE THERE'S REGULATIONS IT'S VERY SPECIFIC AND THE BAIL AGENTS -- AND THE INSURANCE COMPANIES WILL GENERALLY JUST LOOK TO THOSE BECAUSE THE COURT CASES HAVE BEEN CLEAR THAT THESE CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS DON'T APPLY TO INSURANCE PRODUCTS. AND SO -- BAIL FINANCING ITSELF WHICH IS REALLY THE CAUSE OF THIS IS ONLY SOMETHING THAT'S OCCURRED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS BECAUSE IT'S IT'S BEEN NECESSARY NOW THE RATES OF AND SO HIGHS OF THIS IS KIND OF A PROBLEM. THAT CONTINUES TO OCCUR BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST MORE MONEY AT STAKE THEY GET SOMEONE OUT OF JAIL THEY STILL WANT TO GET THEM OUT OF JAIL AND AND IT REALLY COMPLICATES THAT COOPERATION THAT THAT BAIL AGENTS NEED -- FROM THE INTENDED THERE'S TO GET THE DEFENDANTS TO COURT WHEN THEY HAVE THESE -- IF I CAN BE CLEAR JUST TO BECAUSE A GUY DIDN'T SO OF THESE ITEMS ONE TWO THREE AND FOUR AND FIVE IS THAT EXISTING LAW. WELL THAT NOW I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE APPLICATION OF ANY OF THOSE ROLES IS EXISTING LAW BECAUSE OF THE STRONG STATEMENTS BY THE COURTS THAT INSURANCE PRODUCTS ARE NOT CONTROLLED. BY THOSE LAWS IN THE PALE AS PRIMARY IS IS IS IS AN INSURANCE BROCADE GREAT SO I DON'T THINK THAT THE GREAT THANK YOU AND AND MA'AM IF YOU CAN -- DRESS THOSE FIVE ARE THOSE FIVE EAST OF THOSE FIVE ITEMS BEFORE US IS THAT A MATTER OF EXISTING LAW. YEAH THE FIVE ITEMS ARE EXISTING LAW WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS INSERT BUT THEY APPLIED TO THE BAIL AND IMMIGRATION BONDS INDUSTRIES. I'M SORRY YOU JUST SAID THE WILL IT WOULD SAY THAT THEY APPLY TO HAVE THEM. THAT WOULD THAT WOULD THEN I'D HAVE TO STE TO THINK THAT IT DOESN'T APPLY TO THEM TODAY. AND THE ONLY REASON WE'RE HERE AND HAVING TO SPEND THE TIME ON THIS IS BECAUSE THEY'RE SAYING THAT DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY ARE ENGAGING IN. ACTIVITY IS THAT THOSE LAWS SEEK TO REGULATE THAT THEY APPLY TO SO I JUST WANT TO SAY. AS AS WAS JUST MENTIONED THE FINANCING OF PREMIUMS RIGHT CREDIT BAIL IS SOMETHING THAT ONLY STARTED HAPPENING OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AS NECESSARY. DO I CREATE A SENSE ABOUT. BECAUSE PEOPLE COULDN'T PAY THE ENTIRE PREMIUMS UP FRONT AND I HAVE HEARD AND READ THE BAIL AGENTS DID NOT WANT TO DO THAT. THEY DON'T WANT TO BE EXTENDING CREDIT BUT THEY ARE AND WHEN THEY STARTED DOING THAT THEY OPEN THEMSELVES UP TO THE APPLICATION OF A LOT MORE LAWS. AND THEY SHOULD HAVE STARTED LOOKING OUTSIDE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IS REGULATIONS WHEN THEY STARTED ENGAGING IN CONDUCT THAT WAS NOT REGULATED BY THOSE REGULATIONS AND LOOK TO THE LAWS THAT DEAD OKAY I'M GONNA GO TO A NEUTRAL PARTY -- TO THE CONSULTANT -- IN PARTICULAR AS APPLICATION OF THE POINTS IN THE ANALYSIS THE BILL. PROVIDE THEM OUT FOR DISTINCT CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS. SHALL APPLY TO BAIL AND DECLARES THAT TO BE EXISTING LAW. SO. THREE OF THE FOUR ONE A SEPARATED OUT THREE OF THOSE FOUR LAWS GOVERN THE TRANSACTION AT ITS INCEPTION. THAT IS DO YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES IF OR IN A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE OF THE PERSON SPEAKS A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE DO YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PARTICULAR NOTICE CONSUMER CREDIT THING SO. AS TO THREE OF THE FOUR PROVISIONS IN THE BILL. THERE'S NOT A QUESTION OF WHAT IT IS INSIDE THE FOUR CORNERS. OF THE DOCUMENT THE BILL DOESN'T REGULATE THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE DOCTRINE FOR INSTANCE. THE SEARCH AND SEIZURE STUFF THAT THE CENTER SPOKE ABOUT THE BILL DOESN'T PURPORT. TO REGULATE THAT STUFF IT SAYS AT THE INCEPTION OF THE CONTRACT YOU HAVE TO HAVE DONE CERTAIN THINGS SO WHEN WE GET TO THE DECLARATORY OF EXISTING LAW. WHAT WAR PURPORTING TO DO WHEN ALL ADDRESSED THAT RETROACTIVE DECLARATORY NEW ONES IN A SECOND -- BUT WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THINGS THAT SHOULD HAVE ALREADY HAPPENED NOBODY CAN GO BACK AND CHANGE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN SO WE DECLARED TO BE THE EXISTING LAW WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS. THEY VIOLATED THE LAW BACK THEN. IN THIS BUT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT NOW TO CHANGE INTO WHETHER THERE'S ONE LAWSUIT OR TWO LAWSUITS. EVERY TRANSACTION THAT WAS CONSUMMATED IN THE PAST WILL BE SUBJECT. TO YOU DIDN'T DO THE THING AT THE TIME THE CONTRACT WAS ENTERED INTO. THE FOURTH ONE IS THE CAN IT IS THE DEBT COLLECTION ACT -- AND IF THE BILL WERE ENACTED WITH THE COMMITTEE'S PROPOSED AMENDMENTS EVEN THOUGH THE CONTRACT WAS ENTERED INTO IN THE PAST. THE BEHAVIOR OF DEBT COLLECTION WOULD BE OCCURRING AFTER JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY AND SO THAT WOULD APPLY TO CURRENT. BAR SKEWS ME THAT WOULD APPLY TO PREVIOUSLY ENTERED INTO CONTRACTS -- STE SO THE QUESTION THEN IS IT IS IF IT'S RETROACTIVE A WE AUTOMATICALLY SAYING GOTCHA TO TRANSACTIONS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY CONSUMMATED AND THE ANSWER TO THAT IS YES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. RETROACTIVE IN DECLARATORY OF EXISTING LAW. LAWYER GEEK NEW ONES. IF I COULD SIT DOWN WITH LEAD COUNSEL I COULD HAVE A DEBATE ABOUT WHAT'S TECHNICALLY RETROACTIVE AND WHAT'S TECHNICALLY DECLARATORY OF EXISTING LAW. AS A PRACTICAL POLICY MATTER. WE SAY DECLARATORY OF EXISTING LAW TO TRY TO NEW WANTS RETROACTIVITY AND THAT'S WHAT IT. WOULD DO HERE -- IF IF IT WAS LEFT IN THE BILL IN THE BILL WERE ENACTED. IN IF IS THAT ACCURATE. I THINK THAT WAS PRETTY ACCURATE. YES VERY. CAN I ADD ONE THING THOUGH ABOUT THAT CONCERNED WITH THE AMENDMENT AROUND IT THE THIS RETROACTIVITY CONVERSATION. THAT IT SHOULD ONLY GO INTO EFFECT FOR TRANSACTIONS AFTER. JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY WHICH IS THE SUGGEST THESE MAIN POINT YOU MAKE YOUR POINT OKAY SO IF THAT IS THE CASE IF WE WERE TO TAKE THAT AMENDMENT AND SAY THAT THESE ONLY APPLY GOING FORWARD THEN THE BAIL BONDS AND IMMIGRATION BONDS INDUSTRIES FREE TO SUE. EVERYBODY WHO HAS OUTSTANDING DEBT WHO FALLS BEHIND ON PAYMENTS AND THEY CAN NOT ASSERT THOSE LAWS IN THEIR DEFENSE AS WE HAVE DONE AND MISS ELITES CASE THEY WILL NOT HAVE THE BENEFIT OF THOSE LAWS THAT IT SAYS THAT IT DOESN'T APPLY TO TRANSACTIONS. PRIOR TO TWENTY BUT THAT IS ARKAN MAJOR CONCERN. ABOUT THAT AMENDMENT. FIRST OF ALL THAT MEMBERS DON'T SAY CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO ON OR AFTER AND IF THAT IS IN FACT YOU'RE CONCERNED THAT'S DRAFTING ISSUE NOT POLICIES THANK YOU. ALL RIGHTS OF COMMITTEE MEMBERS ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WITHOUT A VERY THOROUGH DISCUSSION. MR COOLEY. COME BACK I MEAN I ON POLICY. I JUST KNOW WHAT ARE WE DOING ON POLICY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL IN THEIR DIGEST GIVES US FIVE PIECES. SO THE FIRST PART OF THE BILL DEALS WITH PERSONS TRANSACTION BIZ WITH PURSES. HISPANIC WHO SPEAK PRIMARILY SPANISH CHINESE TACKLE VIETNAMESE KOREAN. AND WE ACTUALLY GOING TO THAT BODY LONG WE CHANGE THE RULES EXTENDED THE VEIL. IT IS IN THE FORM OF CHANGE. OTHER CONSUMER LEGAL REMEDIES ACT AGAIN WE MAY CONFIRM OF CHANGE. TERRIFYING THE LAWS APPLICATION WE HAVE WE'RE ADDING VERBIAGE TO THAT STATUTE. WE THEN HAVE THE THIRD POINT ROSENTHAL FAIR DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES ACT. AND NEW HERSCHEL ROSENTHAL HIS WIFE -- IN MY CAREER. THEN WE HAVE THE CONSUMER CREDIT CONTRACT LAW. SO IN EACH OF THESE LAWS WE ARE IN FACT MAKING SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES. TO WRITE THIS BUSINESS AND DO IT. AND I DON'T THINK I'M HERE IN AN ARGUMENT WITH THOSE SUBS OF CHANGES IN NORTH THOSE FOR LAWS. THE REAL ISSUE IS THE FIFTH PROVISION OF ALLEGED COUNCIL DIED YES. THE BILL WAS STATE THAT ALL THE CHANGES SPECIFIED ABOVE ALL OF THE CHANGES SPECIFIED ABOVE. ARCTIC TERRITORY JUST IN LAW. SO TO ME IT'S LIKE FOUR FIFTHS OF THE BILL. ARE NOT OBJECTIONABLE ON A GO FORWARD BASIS WE ARE REWRITING THE RULES THAT'S HOW IT'S EXPLAINED IT'S ONLY THIS THE CHARACTERIZATION LOS WHY. I CONTINUE TO THINK THAT. WE WE HAVE A BILL THAT. IT CAN BE READILY PASSED IT'S JUST THAT. FINAL PROVISION. IN THE DIGESTIVE TORTURES OF FLAWS OVERREACH. IN JUST A COOPER IS REAL QUICK AND MEMBERS SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE THE PEACE OFFICERS RECORDS BILL. NEVER SAID RETROACTIVITY IN THERE WHATSOEVER. WHAT THE COURT THE COURTS HAVE DECLARED ITS RETRO? NEVER SAID IN THE BILL. SO IF WE DON'T SPECIFIED HERE. IT'S OPEN TO DEBATE. AND FOR FOR COURT FINDING. AND THAT'S A GREAT EXAMPLE FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE LAST YEAR PEACE OFFICER RECORDS. NEVER SAID RETRO BUT IT IS BEING APPLIED RETROACTIVELY SO IT'S GOING TO BE SPELLED OUT. RIGHT CAN I JUST MAKE CLIP OCCASIONS GERMAN IT MIGHT BE VENTURE BECAUSE I HAVE THE GREATEST CONFIDENCE IN YOU PERSONALLY IN. RELATIONSHIPS ARE IMPORTANT ISSUES ARE TOUGH AND I APPRECIATE THAT THIS ASSEMBLY -- MAYES ON THE NATURE THIS COMMITTEE BECAUSE THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I LIKE TO DO TO IF YOU COULD TELL. SO I APPRECIATE AS WAS LEGISLATIVE BODIES ARE ABOUT. BUT IF AGE AS WAS INDICATED BY YOUR CHIEF CONSULTANT THIS IS A DRAFTING PART WHICH I THINK IT IS QUITE FRANKLY I THINK THERE'S A WAY AROUND THIS THAT UNDER THE DEALS WITH IT I JUST DIDN'T LIKE WHAT THEY DID AND YOU KNOW I'M. WILLING TO YOU KNOW MAYBE. THE GO FOR IT SO YOU KNOW MIKE MY SENSE IS THIS GET STRICTLY GIVEN THE GUIDANCE BY THE MAJORITY LEADER IS THAT LOOK LET'S THIS GOING APPROACH RIGHT. NO. IT DOESN'T OKAY WELL SO I LOOK YOU KNOW MY VIEW IS LET'S LET'S PULL MORE ELBOW GREASE I WAS A LITTLE BIT OTHERWISE PREDISPOSE BY THE WILD FIRES AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. CAN MR MAYS WAS AS WELL SO ON LET'S POLITICAL ELBOW GREASE IN THIS THING IF YOU CAN YOU TIENEN FORTY TODAY'S THE FINAL DAY -- I'M HONORABLE PERSON I'M NOT LOOKING TO TO BE A RAT FINK ON THIS DEAL WHICH TO SIT DOWN AND SEE WE CAN DO IT NOW PERSONALLY ENGAGE IN THE DRAFTING. AND SEE BECAUSE LIKE I'M PARTICULARLY WOULD LIKE THE DEBT COLLECTION THING FOR ME WHEN YOU SAID THAT I DIDN'T READ HOW YOU READ THIS. CAUSED WHEN SOMEBODY GOES TO THE DEBT COLLECTION IS ALL ABOUT YOU CAN'T HARASS PEOPLE AND DO THE KINDS OF THINGS THESE CONTRACTS CONTRACT. FOR AN HOUR TO MAKE SURE THE APPLY NOW WHAT YOU SAY I'M TELLING MY OPINIONS WE FINISH ABOUT. AND SO SOME OF THESE OTHER PROVISIONS THE SAME THING I'M NOT LOOKING TO TO RE TRANSLATE DOCUMENTS THAT HAPPENED THREE YEARS AGO. WHAT I DON'T WANT TO BUT HEAR ME OUT ABOUT IT BUT I ALSO DON'T WANT TO AFFECT THE COURT CASE AND I BELIEVE YOU YOU SAY YOU BE SILENT ON IT IN MY JUDGMENT IS IF YOU'RE SILENT ON THE COURT? IT'S SILENT YOU'RE ACTUALLY MAKING A STATEMENT WHEN THERE'S A JUSTICE AND YOU DON'T CALL IT OUT YOU'RE MAKING A STATEMENT WHAT BECAUSE I GUARANTEE YOU. YOU SAY WHAT YOU WANT BUT I PROMISE YOU IN THE COURT PROCEEDINGS LIKE I HAVE BEFORE YOUR THE COMPLAINT THE LEGAL DOCUMENTS THEY'RE GOING TO COME IN AND USE EVERY ARGUMENT THEY'RE GOING TO USE. TO SUBSTANTIATE THEIR POSITION THEY'RE GONNA SAY SEE THE LEGISLATURE MADE NO COMMENT AND HENCE THEY CLEARLY DOESN'T MEAN BECAUSE THEY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXTEND THIS AND THEY DIDN'T SO THE FACT THAT THIS BILL PUTS US IN THAT POSITION. SO I'M TRYING TO GET TIME WE CAN GET PAST THIS AND WORK TOGETHER WITH THE COMMITTEE TRY TO DRAFT IT. I THINK THE MAJORITY WHOSE POINT PRETTY CLEAR. WHY NOT THEN A SERVER EXCEPT TO AMENDMENT SEE? IT SAYS NO ACTIONS TAKEN ON THIS BILL ARE INTENDED TO INFLUENCE LITIGATION SEEKING TO APPLY THESE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS TO BAIL AND SO FORTH. WHY IS THAT A? WHY NOT ACCEPT THAT? THIS IS A WELL I'M JUST LIMITING THE BILL LANGUAGE INSTEAD OF A SUMMARY HANG ON THE CHANGE WAS A MEMBER. WELL IT DOESN'T REALLY SAY THAT WHAT IT SAYS THAT THAT'S A SUMMARY THAT'SNOT CONSISTENT WITH THE LANGUAGE OF THE AMENDMENT. THE AMENDMENT SAYS SPECIFICALLY THE OPPOSITE IN MY READING IT'S A THE CHANGES MADE BY THIS ACT DO NOT APPLY IN ANY MANNER AND IN IS NOT THE INTENT THE LEGISLATURE TO TO AFFECT THIS. WE DON'T WANT TO OF WE WANT WHAT THE COURT MOVE THE WAY THE COURT MOVES. THAT I WOULD I INTERPRET THAT WHEN I READ IT THE REASON I SAID NO IS WERE IN FACT BEING GIVEN A LEG UP IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S NEUTRAL BUT IT'S NOT. BECAUSE IF I WAS A JUDGE IN OUR MEETING A CASE WELL THE LEGISLATURE CLEARLY DIDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT. YOU KNOW DON'T FORGET THINK ABOUT WERE ACT OKAY THESE PEOPLE HERE TODAY ARE SAYING TO THEM THE INDUSTRY WE'RE OK WITH THIS BUT HISTORICALLY THEY SAID WE NEVER WORLD QUE THEY'VE CHANGED THEIR POSITION ON THE FIRST FIVE POINTS. THAT A GERMAN COOLEY MENTION OKAY THEY'VE CHANGE YOUR POSITION THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THE CHANGE OF POSITION IN EVERY PROCEEDING WHEN I WAS DOING THE OTHER BILL. EVERYTHING THEY SAID WAS THIS DOESN'T APPLY HERTZBERG YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. NOW THEY'RE FLIPPING IN SAYING THEY DO BUT THEY'RE SCARED ABOUT THIS NOTION OF RETROACTIVITY OKAY GET IT. SO THE DELICATE DANCE IS TO BASICALLY MAKE SURE ADDS WERE CONSIDERING THIS. WE DON'T ADVERSITY CASE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER AND I JUST SUGGEST THAT THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS HERE SAYING THIS ISN'T THE INTENT. THE INTENT LEGISLATURE IS THAT THAT WE ALWAYS INTENDED THIS TO BE THE CASE I DON'T THINK THAT'S A QUESTION I THINK ANY MEMBER HERE WANTS TO DEFRAUD PEOPLE OR HAVE THEIR CONTRACTS AND THERE'S A THERE'S A BLURRING BETWEEN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. AND THE FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS. THOSE APPROVAL THOSE POINTS OF THAT WHICH MADE EARLIER ABOUT THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER HAVING APPROVE OF COURSE THE APPROVED THE INSURANCE RELATIONSHIP. BUT THEN THERE'S A SUBSEQUENT TRANSACTION WHICH IS THE FINANCING SIDE AND THEY SAY THAT -- WHEN THERE'S NO INTEREST BUT THERE'S SO MANY FEES AND SO MANY CHARGES AND SO MANY THINGS THAT THROUGHOUT THE INDUSTRY AND HOW THE JURISPRUDENTIAL DYNAMIC OF OF CONSUMER PROTECTION ARE INFORMED TO BE? CHARGES AND YOU HAVE SITUATIONS WE HAVE CASE I CAN BRING THEM BEFORE YOU WERE SEVEN FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE PAYING FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. BECAUSE OF ALL THE STUFF THAT WAS OTHERWISE INFORMED ABOUT IT AND SO THAT THAT TO ME IS THE QUESTION AND THEN WE'RE I THINK WE'RE OBJECTIVE IS THE SAME I THINK YOUR POINT IS CORRECT. AND IF WE CAN GET THERE I'D BE HAPPY TO DO IT LIKE TO MOVE IT OUT OF THIS THE COMMITTEE TODAY. AND COMMITTEE YOU THAT WILL GIVE IT TO YOU GUYS AND YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK IT PASSES I'M I'M NOT GONNA TAKE IT UP IF IT DIDN'T GET A PASS. COURSE COURSE ONE APPROACH IS TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS. AND THEN CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE LANGUAGE IN THE AMENDMENTS THAT'S ONE APPROACH FOR MAKING AMENDED THE FLOOR -- ALL. THE TIMING MISTER CALDERON. THANK YOU -- SO LOOK AT I I THINK THAT THE IF THE ISSUE HERE IS THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE LANGUAGE WHAT IT MEANS AND WHAT IT DOES ME AS A RETROACTIVE IS NOT WHAT RETROACTIVE WHAT'S WHAT'S THAT GOING TO MEAN. MOVING FORWARD NOW MAJORITY THAT MAJORITY LEADER MAJORITY LEADER I THINK THE POINT IS IS WE WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT TO GET THIS BILL OUT OF COMMITTEE WANT TO GET IT TO THE FLOOR. THEN YOU CAN HAVE SOME TIME TO WORK ON IT WERE THE FIRST YEAR OF TWO YEAR SESSION. SO WHAT. SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO WHEN IT COMES TO MOVING FORWARD I THINK WHAT THE MEMBERS HERE ARE ASKING FOR IS AND A COMBAT COMMITMENT FROM YOU TO WORK SPECIFICALLY ON THIS. THIS PIECE OF THE BILL ON THIS LANGUAGE I THINK THAT YOU'VE JUST INTIMATED AND UNDERSTANDING TO WORK ON THAT. BUT AT THIS POINT TIME WHEN IT COMES TO COMMITTEES PERSPECTIVE ONCE IT'S OUT OF THE COMMITTEES HANDS. IS IT IS A WAY TO BRING IT BACK WELL THERE ARE WAYS TO BRING IT BACK BECAUSE COMMITTEE AT ANY POINT TIME. I CAN DO MOTION ON THE FLOOR AND AND THE BILL CAN BE RECALLED BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE RIGHT HOWEVER. IF WE MOVE IT OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE TODAY WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE MEMBERS WHO ARE NOT CURRENTLY IN SUPPORT BECAUSE OF THE LANGUAGE WITHOUT SPECIFIC CLARIFICATION -- OR THERE SEEMS TO BE CONFUSION WOULD YOU COMMIT. THAT A MOVES TO THE FLOOR YOU'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THIS COMMITTEE OVER THE BREAK. CONTINUE TO WORK WITH MANY ONCE WE GET BACK. AS LONG AS THERE IS AN WORK TO AN UNDERSTANDING AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THE COMMITTEE AND A SIGN OFF BY THIS CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE. THAT ONCE THIS BILLS ON THE FLOOR YOU WILL TAKE IT UP ONLY IF YOU HAVE THE AGREEMENT. BY THE CHAIR IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THAT AGREEMENT WITH THE CHAIR YOU WILL HOLD THE BILL ON THE FLOOR. AND WHAT WE CAN TAKE IT UP AT ANY POINT TIME WHEN WE COME BACK SPECIFICALLY IN JANUARY RATHER THAN SAYING STOCKTON COMMITTEE OR YOU CAN STAY. IN THIS COMMITTEE IF YOU DON'T END UP WITH THE VOTES BUT MOVING IT OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE TODAY WITH A COMMITMENT TO NOT BRING THE BILL UP. I KNOW IT AS LONG AS YOU HAVE. THE SIGN OFF FROM THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE. WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT THAT AS LONG AS THERE'S THAT SIGN OFF WILL TAKE THE BILL UP IF NOT. THEN I WILL TAKE THE BILL UP. THERE'S AND THERE'S A MALE TO MILLIE WHERE YOU WANT TO SET. THE I LIKE THE FIGHT -- IT'S MY NATURE SORRY ABOUT THAT EVERYBODY. A AND I YOU KNOW I I JUST BELIEVE THE ARGUMENTS ARE BOGUS BUT BUT LOOK IT GIVEN THE THAT WHERE WE ARE TODAY I I'M HAPPY. I'M JUST WORRIED ABOUT LOOK THESE THESE ARE ALL ABOUT JUST YOU KNOW YOU MAY HAVE PRETTY FRANK AND THOUGHT THE THINK OUT TAUGHT MY HEAD SOMETIMES TOO MUCH SO SORRY BUT BROKEN IN THE AYE. STONE AYE COOPER -- BUT BUT YOU KNOW I'M I'M HAPPY TO DO IT BUT I WANT GUIDANCE FROM THE YOU KNOW THE STAFF BASICALLY GAVE US THE STUFF THEY GAVE US. STUFF AGAIN I DON'T BELIEVE AT THE STAFF LEVEL THAT I LOVE TO WORK WITH THE CHAIRMAN THAT WE REALLY GOT ANY RESPONSIVENESS I I'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS BEFORE IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME OF IN THIS COMMITTEE. THIS ENTIRE ANALYSIS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY WAS COMPLETELY DISCUSSED LONGER NO MORE PAGES JUST ON THIS ISSUE IN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. AGAIN THIRTY EIGHT ZERO IN THE SENATE IT'S GONE GONE GONE WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS DANCE WE'VE BEEN EVERYWHERE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN HERE AND HIT A WALL. FOR WHATEVER REASON I JUST I I JUST WANT TO COPY I'M HAPPY TO DO THAT BECAUSE IT'S HONOR IS EVERYTHING TO ME. AND AND I REALLY THINK THIS NOTION OF RETROACTIVITY THE LEDGE COUNCIL I WANT TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU. ME THIS IS NOT TRUE IT IS NOT TRUE IT IS THE WAY IT IS NOT COULD COURTS MAKE DECISIONS -- SIMILAR COOPER OF COURSE THEY CAN'T NOBODY CAN STOP THAT ONCE THEY MAKE THAT DECISION AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT IN THIS CASE ONE OR THE OTHER BUT YES I WILL MAKE THAT COMMITMENT. BECAUSE I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND WE'LL WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT AND JUST TO BE CLEAR HOUSE OF ORIGIN WE'RE DEALING WITH THEIR OWN HOUSE OF ORIGIN WE HAVE A LOT MORE TIME TO GO THROUGH BILLS NOW IS A LOT OF BILLS THAT WE HAVE TO GO. THROUGH THAT PERIOD OF TIME THERE'S LESS BILLS WHEN WE GET YOUR BILLS ARE HERE FOR THE STILL JUST A LOT OF WORK TO DO. SO. IT'S A TRUNCATED AMOUNT OF TIME THEY'RE JUST NEEDS TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO WORK THROUGH THE DETAILS NOW YOU IF WE IF MY UNDERSTANDING IS IS THAT YOU ARE COMMITTED COMMITTED TO NOT TAKE THIS BILL UP UNLESS THERE IS AN AGREEMENT BY THIS COMMITTEE AND BY. THIS CHAIR IF THERE IS NO AGREEMENT THE BILL WILL NOT BE TAKEN OUT. AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT IT'S CLEAR WITH YOU BETWEEN YOU AND I SO THAT WHEN THE BILLS ON IF THE BILLS ON THE FLOOR THERE'S NO CONFUSION ABOUT. BY THE BILL MIGHT NOT BE COMING UP IF I'M NOT GETTING OKAY FROM MY CHAIRMAN BECAUSE WE COULD ALSO PULL THE BILL BACK IN COMMITTEE BUT I THINK AT THIS POINT TIME. THERE NEEDS TO BE CONFIDENCE AMONG THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE THAT THAT'S WHAT THE UNDERSTANDING IS IT'S GOOD IT'S GOOD CAN IT CONTINUE TO ALLOW YOU TO WORK. ON THIS ISSUE OVER THE NEXT MONTH MONTH TO MONTH POTENTIALLY. GET THE BILL OUT GET ON TO THE FLOOR IT'S A BETTER POSITION FOR YOU TO BE IN THERE SOME CONFIDENCE. BY THE MEMBERS ON THIS COMMITTEE THAT THEY FEEL LIKE. THERE'S GONNA BE SOME TYPE OF RESOLUTION TO THE ISSUE OR NOT IF THERE'S RESOLUTION THE BILL COME UP THERE'S NO RESOLUTION THE BILL WILL NOT COME UP. THEN WE CAN MOVE FORWARD BUT ULTIMATELY EVEN IF YOU DO NOT COME. TO AN AGREEMENT YOUR BILL STILL ON THE FLOOR. AND CAN WE COME UP WE CAN COME UP IN JANUARY GIVES YOU THE REST OF THE YEAR. TO WORK ON IT IF THAT IS NECESSARY WHICH I'M HOPING IT'S NOT NECESSARY I'VE HAD THOSE A COUPLE BILLS IN THE SENATE BECAUSE WE JUST HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO WORK ON IT. BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT SOMETIMES WE JUST NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME. WE WANT TO STAY ALIVE KEEP FIGHTING FIGHT. THERE WAS THAT THE UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IS REMEMBER YOUR DADDY THE ONLY QUESTION I ASK IS IF I AND I'M JUST WORRIED ABOUT THE YOU KNOW I REALLY THINK THAT. I THINK IT'LL SEND A BIG MESSAGE TO THE INDUSTRY YES THE ANSWER QUESTIONS YES WITH OR WITHOUT GOOD OCCASIONALLY SHAKE YOUR HAND -- ED AND BUT I JUST I THINK THIS DISCUSSION SENDS A BIG MESSAGE TO THE INDUSTRY AS TO CLEAN IT UP AT LEAST THAT THE BAIL AGENTS TO ENGAGE IN THIS BEHAVIOR TO CLEAN UP THEIR ACS THAT'S ALL I WANT TO DO AND I'M DEEPLY AFRAID. THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE THIS THESE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF FINANCING CONTRACTS OUT THERE AND PEOPLE THINK THAT THEY CAN BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY THAT'S MY CONCERN MISTER CHAIRMAN. AND I THINK WE CAN GET AROUND THAT IN THE DRAFTING OF THE LANGUAGE TO ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVE SO WITH THAT. I THINK I I GOT A WHOLE BUNCH OF THINGS TO SAY BUT I THINK THAT MAKES MY CLOTHES BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN QUITE GENEROUS COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND MISTER CHAIRMAN. YOUR TIME IN DELIBERATING THIS MATTER THANK YOU MISTER MAJORITY. MR FRAZIER DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION OR COMMENT JUST KIND OF A MOMENT -- MISTER RECORD THROUGH WEEK WE ARE. AS LEGISLATORS -- IN CHARGE OF DOING NO HARM. TO PROPONENTS AND OPPONENTS [inaudible] AND MY FORMER LIFE AS A BUSINESS OWNER. I AM VERY CAREFUL ABOUT THE WORD RECTAL ACT RECTOR RETROACTIVE. I CAN'T EVEN SAY IT CORRECTLY. BECAUSE I HATE IT -- IF I'M GOING OUT AND DOING BUSINESS AND I HAVE ALWAYS HAVE THAT HAMMER OVER ME. OF MISTRUST OF GOVERNMENT YEAH. WHY WOULD I EXTEND MYSELF FOR OTHERS? AND TRY TO HELP. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL THAT'S A SLIPPERY SLOPE. BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE. AND IF WE'RE GOING TO HEAR TO CAUGHT AFIRE CLARIFY. THEN SAY IN ITS ENTIRETY IT WILL NOT BE RETROACTIVE SO NO JUDGE. CAN MISINTERPRET. GOING FORWARD BUT AS A FORMER BUSINESS OWNER. I WOULD BE OFFENDED IF EVERY TIME THAT WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY AS THE LEGISLATURE TO INCLUDE. THE RETROACTIVE A COMPONENT. BUT I WOULD BE VERY VERY -- RISK ADVERSE TO DO ANYTHING THAT WOULD ADVANCE [inaudible] MY JEOPARDY. SO I AM ASKING YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU. BUT REST THAT YOU HAVE THAT ASSURANCE OR GIVE ME THAT ASSURANCE. THAT YOU SAY IT'S NOT IN THERE. THANK CLEARLY STATE THAT IT WILL NOT BE IN THERE. BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO PUT. PEOPLE AT RISK FOR SOMETHING THEY EXTENDED THEMSELVES FOR AND I CAN'T SAY THAT EVERYBODY IN THE BILL BONDS INDUSTRY. IS BAD. OF COURSE NOT. BUT WE'RE WE'RE ASSUMING THEY ARE BY SAYING THIS. AND I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE CLEAR YEAH ABOUT PROTECTING BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA. WELL IF I WOULD ADD ONE MORE SENTENCE IN RESPONSE TO A GERMAN FRASIER'S COMMENTS HERE THAT IS IMPORTANT. THE REAL IN ON MY SENSE OF THE ISSUE BEFORE US TODAY. IS IT'S ONE OF IT'S THE ISSUE OF IGNORANCE OF THE LAW IS NO EXCUSE. AND WHAT HAPPENED IS THE LAW EXISTS. AND THE BILL INDUSTRY DIDN'T REALLY REALIZE IT RIGHT NOW THERE'S LITIGATION AGAINST THE BILL AS YOU FAN I TRUSTED REALIZED THE COLLUSION ON 10% WHICH ISN'T IN THE LAW. THEY'RE GOING TO GET NAILED BECAUSE THEY JUST IGNORED ABOUT THE LAW. AND THEY MOVED FROM BEING AN INSURANCE COMPANY TO A FINANCE COMPANY AND DIDN'T REALIZE THE LAWS APPLY. IN THE SINGLE BIGGEST PROMISE OF WE ALL KNOW IS IGNORANCE OF THE LAW IS NO EXCUSE. WE ALL COULD COME WITH EXAMPLES TO THAT ANDTHAT'S REALLY WHAT'S GOING ON AND NOW THEY'RE SAYING WELL WE DID KNOW ABOUT IT BECAUSE WE DON'T THINK IT REALLY APPLY TO US IN TRYING TO OBFUSCATE BECAUSE ARE WORRIED ABOUT IT. THE COURT ALREADY SAID IT APPLIED TO THEM SO I DON'T WANT RETROACTIVITY BUT THE FLIP SIDE OF IT IS I COMPLETELY AGREE I'M TO HAVE BEEN IN MANY BUSINESSES AND I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAY. MISTER CHAIRMAN THE THE OF A DIFFERENT COMMITTEE BUT THE THE THE POINT IS THAT. THAT IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT THAT'S WHY THIS IS SUCH A DELICATE CONVERSATION I WANT TO COME BACK AND EXPLAIN THAT BECAUSE AS WE TALK WITH YOUR CHAIRMAN. OF THIS COMMITTEE AND I ANALYZE IT THAT'S WHAT MY CONCERN IS AND SO I DON'T WANT TO WITH AFFECTED ONE WAY OR THE OTHER COURTS WILL INTERPRET WHAT THEY'RE DOING WE TAKE ACTION I DON'T WANT THEM TO SAY -- BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE THE ARGUMENTS THAT -- WE APPLIED FOR THIS IT CLEARLY ISN'T IT'S AN ADVANTAGE AND WHEN YOU SAY IT DOESN'T AFFECT EITHER PERSON IT DOES WE CAN FIGURE IT OUT I CAN TELL THE LANGUAGE IF IT TO TO MAKE IT WORK I THINK. WE'LL HAVE HONEST DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT A LITTLE MY COMMITMENT TO THE MAJORITY LEADER. FUTURE JUST ONE MORE COMMENT. AND WHEN I US WHEN I TALK ABOUT WE DO NO HARM. MR IS VERY WE TALK ABOUT. THEN THE INDUSTRY WILL BEING -- REMISS ARE NOT WANTING TO EXTEND CREDIT FOR THE PEOPLE YOU'RE TRYING TO PROTECT AND THEY END UP STAYING IN JAIL BECAUSE NOW THAT WE'VE HEAVY HANDED. THIS PROCESS WE ACTUALLY HARM MORE PEOPLE THAN WE ACTUALLY HELP. THAT'S MY CONCERN [inaudible] WHITE. THANK YOU ALRIGHT. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- CAN WE GET SOME CLARIFICATION FROM THE CHAIR AND AND MAKE SURE STAFF. ON THE COMMENTS IN AGREEMENT THAT. A MAJORITY LEADER PROPOSED AND WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE. HERE BECAUSE I'M A GET CLARIFICATION ON THAT GOOD IDEA I I THINK THAT. HONESTLY IS ONE I THINK AT AND TO THE AUTHOR QUITE A GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT FOR I DO THINK THAT. THE FIRST COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE BY THE MAJORITY LEADER WAS IT WOULD BE CSUS SIMPLER CLEANER IF IF WEEK YOU ACCEPTED THE AMENDMENTS AS A COMMITTEE STAFF. PRESENTED HERE TODAY AND THEN CONTINUE THAT DIALOGUE IN THAT CONTEXT AND THAT LEVEL BECAUSE THAT WOULD CLEAR A LOT OF THE DISCOMFORT THAT EXISTS AROUND THE TABLE AND PROBABLY GET A LOT OF AYE VOTES. IF YOU ACCEPTED THOSE ARE AND IT WOULD BE BIPARTISAN AT THAT MOMENT I BELIEVE ARE AT LEAST WITH. ONE MISTER CHAIR BACK TO YOU RIGHT RIGHT OLD MAYBE YOU CAN GET THAT CLARIFICATION. I THINK THE CHALLENGE OF WITH MISTER CALDERON NOTION. IS THAT IT WILL LEAD TO A DEBATE. ON THE ESOTERIC MEANINGS OF RETROACTIVITY. THAT'S TRUE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT JAMMIN ENERGY DEBATE ON EXACTLY WHAT LANGUAGE WE MAY ULTIMATELY ADOPT IN THE LEGISLATURE THAT MAY OR MAY NOT AFFECT THE JUDGE OR JUDGES IN THE CASE. THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT. WHICH GOES AGAIN TO RETROACTIVITY -- AND I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A A WISE PERSON WHO CAN MAKE THAT CALL -- YOU KNOW. YOU WON'T ACCEPT AMENDMENTS THAT CLARIFY THAT THIS IS NOT RETROACTIVE. AND YOU HAVE A REASON FOR THAT. BUT THAT'S EXACTLY THE POINT. IS YOU DON'T WANT. TO TELL THE COURT THAT WE'VE DECIDED. THAT IT SHALL NOT BE RETROACTIVE. THE LAW YOU WANT TO GO INTO EFFECT ON JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY YOU DON'T WANT ANY NOTION. THAT SOMEHOW -- AFFECTS THAT THAT CASE. BUT NO MATTER WHAT WE DO IT WILL AFFECT THAT CASE. WE'LL TRY HONOR WHAT WE OFFER SUGGESTION WOULD ADDRESS THAT. BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE HAD IN OUR CONVERSATIONS YOUR OFFICE IT WITHIN THE EXACT CONVERSATION TO CONSULT EXACTLY WE'RE TRYING TO DO NOT AFFECT THE CASE. AND THE ARGUMENT YOU MADE ABOUT OUR EARLIER BILL AND YOUR THEIR DRAFT PASSED EVERYWHERE ELSE THAT AFFECTED THE CASE SO YOU SAID NOTHING YOU'RE CAN AFFECT THE CASE. YOU COULD WRITE THIS I THINK IN A WAY THAT IN THAT BASICALLY EXPRESSES THE DISCUSSION. THAT ON THE ONE HAND YOU CAN SIMPLY WRITE THIS THE INTENT LANGUAGE AND GIVE GUIDANCE TO THE COURT. THAT WE DIDN'T THAT ONE WAY THERE WAS THERE WAS A THERE WAS A A COULD STRUGGLE THERE WAS CONCERN ON THE ONE HAND WE ARGUE THAT IF WE SAID SOMETHING IT WOULD BE GREAT THIS ON THE OTHER HAND WE ARE THIS WE DON'T WANT TO SEND THIS THING COURT. CAN MAKE WHATEVER DETERMINATION WITHOUT CONSIDERATION AND THAT COULD ACTUALLY ABOVE ACHIEVE THE THE THIS IS KIND OF A CONUNDRUM. BUT CONUNDRUMS ARE MADE TO BE SOLVED I THINK WE GOT A SHOT AT NIGHT CERTAINLY WOULD LOVE TO SPEND A LITTLE TIME WITH YOU MISTER DALY AND THAT'S TO GIVE IT A SHOT. IF WE GIVE IT A SHOT IN IT YOU PASSED OUT HERE TODAY AND WE WE GO AND WE DON'T GET IT I'M NOT TAKING IT TO THE FLOOR IT'S JUST MADE THAT COMMITMENT. AND SO IT'S IT'S A IT'S A SITUATION WHERE -- AND YOU KNOW I I JUST THINK IT'S A IT'S A FAIR OR THE APPROACH YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THIS IS NOT LIKE THIS THE FIRST TIME IS ISSUES BUT ANALYZE WE'VE SEEN IN A VERY EXTENSIVE DEAL AND WE'VE ALREADY HAD THIS DISCUSSION. WE'RE JUST INTO THIS DEBATE BUT THAT'S WHAT WE GET TO DO AND WE HAVE A LOT OF FUN DOING IT SIR. YOU A DIFFERENT DEFINITION OF FUN THAN I DO. ALTHOUGH IT DOES NOT YOU AND YOUR DISTRICT. ALRIGHT ALL RIGHT -- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MR BIGELOW TO THAT HELP YOU. I JUST WANT. TO MAYBE HELP WITH. WILL YOU BE SAYING AGAIN DEFINITELY SET ALL OF THE COMMITTEE. NO I AM NOT YOU'RE NOT I AM NOT ONLY A CERTAIN ONES THAT WE DISCUSSED YOU'RE GIVING UP AND I'M AND I'M AND I'M JUST AND I'M COMMITTING TO HAVING A DISCUSSION TO SOLVE THE OTHER PROBLEMS WITH THE CHAIR AND I WON'T BRING THE MATTER TO THE FLOOR.

TO OUR WITNESSES HERE I THINK WE WE'VE GOT A DEREK ROBINSON'S BACK -- FIRE CAPTAIN WITH KERN -- KERN COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT -- AS WAS BRIAN RICE VÃ  CPF AND CHRISTY AS STAFF MISTER THANK YOU AGAIN SENATOR AND LET ME SAY OF VERY VERY IMPORTANT SUBJECT. I SALUTE YOU FOR FOR ADDRESSING IT. AND REALLY APPRECIATE THE THOUGHT FULL -- DISCUSSIONS WE HAD AND THEN THE COMMITTEE STAFF HAD WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF. FOR ON AMENDMENTS -- TO THE TO MOVE THIS FORWARD AND I A I EXPECT WILL BE ENGAGING ON THIS. TO IN COMING YEARS AS WELL BECAUSE IT'S A IT'S A MAJOR. A MAJOR ISSUE. PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- ON A PERSONAL THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THIS MORNING AND FOR HEARING THIS -- BILL ALSO HONEST THANK CENTER STERN -- FOR TAKING THE LEAD ON THIS IN RIGHT THIS BILL IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME AND THE REST MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS. MY NAME IS DEREK ROBINSON AS HE MENTIONED A CAPTAIN WITH KERN COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT WITH EIGHTEEN PLUS YEARS OF EXPERIENCE. AS FIREFIGHTERS WERE EXPECTED TO HAVE A NORMAL RESPONSE TO ABNORMAL SITUATIONS ON A DAILY BASIS WE SEE THE WORST MOMENTS IN EVERYONE'S LIVES THAT'S WHY THEY CALL US. AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A NORMAL RESPONSE AND INTERNALIZE THAT. IT DOESN'T LEAD TO GOOD -- MENTAL HEALTH IT LEADS TO AN INJURY. IS OUR JOB TO BE THE HELPERS WHEN A MASSIVE WILDFIRE DESTROYS. AN ENTIRE TOWN OR WHEN A YOUNG PERSON. IT HAS THEIR LIFE CUT SHORT BY A SENSELESS VIOLENCE. IN KERN COUNTY FEW YEARS AGO WE HAD -- SKIN FIRE THAT DESTROYED -- MAJOR COMMUNITY AND AND KERN COUNTY. AND AT THE TIME I BELIEVE WAS THE BIGGEST FIRE IN THE HISTORY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FOLLOWED SHORTLY BY THE THOMAS FIRE THE CAR FIRE AND OTHERS THAT DESTROYED COMMUNITIES UP AND DOWN THE STATE. WHAT'S LEFT IN THE AFTERMATH OF A PATH OF A WILDFIRE IS PURE DEVASTATION. I'VE HAD THE LOOK OF SOMEONE IN THE EYES. AND TRY TO EXPLAIN TO THEM WHY THEIR HOUSE BURNED DOWN AND THEIR NEIGHBOR WHO'S TEN FEET AWAY. HOUSE IS STILL STANDING. THERE IS NO EXPLANATION THERE IS NO WAY -- TO JUSTIFY THAT -- EGGS THAT. TRAVESTY TO AN INDIVIDUAL. WE'RE TRYING TO THINK THAT ANY CALL WE RETURN FROM SAFELY IS A GOOD CALL. THAT'S NOT TRUE. WE MAY WALK AWAY FROM AN INCIDENT BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE WALKED AWAY IN ONE PIECE. POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS IT IS AN INJURY. EVERY BIT AS REAL AS A BROKEN ARM OR BLOWN OUT KNEE. AND LIKE VISIT A LIKE A PHYSICAL INJURY IT ONLY GETS WORSE IF WE DON'T TAKE CARE OF IT. OR WORSE ACT LIKE IT ISN'T THERE. FOR TOO LONG WE AS FIREFIGHTERS HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR LOOKING AWAY FROM POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS INJURY. AND UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE STARTING TO SEE THE EFFECTS. AS WE SIT HERE TODAY MORE FIREFIGHTERS. DIE BY THEIR OWN HAND THAN IN THE LINE OF DUTY. BY SOME COUNTS AS MANY AS A THIRD OF ALL FIREFIGHTERS CONSIDER SUICIDE [inaudible] I KNOW. BECAUSE OF ONE OF THOSE THAT HAVE THOSE THOUGHTS. LUCKILY FOR ME ON DECEMBER FIRST. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN I SUMMON THE COURAGE TO ASK FOR HELP. SB HERE'S A FIREFIGHTER PLAYING THE TOUGH GUY ROLE. IT'S A HARD JOB SUCK IT UP BUTTERCUP. IT ALMOST KILLED ME. EVERY FIREFIGHT WITH BLOOD IN THEIR VEINS. KNOWS HIS FEELINGS. THERE'S AN FIREFIGHTER ANYWHERE. HE DOESN'T HAVE THE CALL THAT STICK WITH THEM. THE SMELLS THE SOUNDS THAT HAUNT THEM. REGULARLY THEY'VE. BURN A HOLE IN YOUR SOUL AND YOUR HEART AND YOUR YOUR MIND THAT CAN'T BE TAKEN CARE. I THINK IT WAS SAID BEST WHEN SOMEONE. SAID I WISH THAT MY BRAIN COULD. AND SEE THE THINGS THAT MY EYES HAVE SEEN. IF EVER THERE WAS A JOB RELATED INJURY FOR FIREFIGHTERS AND FIRST RESPONDERS. IT IS POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS. SENATE BILL FIVE FORTY TWO SIMPLY RECOGNIZES THIS REALITY AND CREATES A PATH FORWARD FOR HEALING. FIREFIGHTERS AREN'T LOOKING FOR A WAY OUT. FOR ALL ITS DIFFICULTIES WE LOVE OUR JOB AND CAN'T IMAGINE DOING ANYTHING ELSE. BUT IS JOB THAT PUTS US AT RISK. OUR BODIES AND OUR MINDS. THE WORKERS COMPENSATION WAS BUILT TO HELP EMPLOYEES HILL FROM THEIR JOB RELATED INJURIES SO THEY CAN GO BACK TO WORK. SB FIVE FORTY TWO ASKS. IS THAT FIREFIGHTERS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY HAD HEALED THE WOUNDS OF POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS. SO THEY CAN GET BACK TO THE JOB THEY LOVE. I BELIEVE THAT IF WE RECOGNIZE POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS INJURY FOR WHAT IT IS. WITHOUT SUSPICION A REJECTION. WE WILL HAVE A HEALTHIER PROFESSION. AND THAT MAKES US BETTER ABLE TO DO OUR JOBS PROTECTING OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR STATE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU SUPPORT SB FIVE FORTY TWO NICE AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU SIR. PLEASE GO AHEAD. SIR ARE YOU. BUT WILL COMMITTEE CHAIR IN THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S BROWN RICE I AM THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS.

THIS IS NOT A PERSON THIS THE FIREFIGHTER THAT REACHED OUT TO ME IS A TRAINED SUPPORTER WITH MANY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE HAS TESTIFIED IN THIS CAPITAL BEFORE. SINCE JUNE FIRST THREE ACTIVE DUTY FIREFIGHTERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE TAKEN THEIR LIVES BY THEIR OWN HAND IT IS BECOMING A REGULAR OCCURRENCE FOR US. IN I BELIEVE IN THE THE BREAKING THE STIGMA AND I SAT HERE TRYING TO THINK OF THE ADJECTIVES VERBS. THAT I COULD PUT THE FOR YOU.

THAN THAT OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK HER AYE VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU. A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MATTHEW STIFLING A BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR LOS ANGELES DEPUTY SHERIFFS IN THE LOS ANGELES POLICE PROTECTIVELY IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. CORNEA PJ WEB MÃ  REPRESENTING A PEACE OFFICERS RESEARCH ASSOCIATION IN CALIFORNIA CORRECT AND WE FULLY SUPPORT IS VERY IMPORTANT BILL. THANK YOU SIR ANY OTHER PERSONS. WISHING TO SPEAK IN FAVOR THE BILL. NOW WILL GO TO ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU. TO THE WITNESSES WHO SPOKE IN FAVOR THANK YOU. PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN VERS ADJACENT SMELTER HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION ON WORKERS COMPENSATION AND SEE SEX AS INSURANCE WITH ALREADY. HI I WANNA SAY A COUPLE THINGS BEFORE I GET INTO THE MEAT OF OUR REASONS FOR BEING OPPOSED TO THE BILL -- ONE I I HOPE -- THAT EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THAT EMPLOYERS COMPLETELY AGREE THAT A PSYCHIATRIC INJURY AS A REAL INJURY -- ANY ANY IDEA TO THE CONTRARY IS JUST PLAIN WRONG -- ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE FOLKS THAT ARE AS BRAVE AS THE GENTLEMAN THAT YOU JUST HEARD DOING THE THINGS. THAT THEY DO -- UP MY OWN BROTHER IS A VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTER UP IN LASSEN COUNTY -- WE ALL I THINK WE ALL KNOW THESE FOLKS AND SEE FIRSTHAND OF THESE ARE REAL INJURIES THAT SHOULD BE DEALT WITH BY THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM -- I ALSO WANT TO TAKE A MINUTE JUST TO THANK THE COMMITTEE THE STAFF -- ESPECIALLY CENTER STERN AND HIS STAFF -- THERE'RE ON REAL AMOUNT OF TIME THAT WORKING THAT WERE -- SPENT TALKING TO US IN REAL DETAIL ABOUT THE POLICY ISSUES RELATED TO THIS BILL THAT SENATOR STERN SELF SPENT ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF WITH US -- GOING THROUGH THE STUFF HIS TO HIS STAFF IN TOTAL PROBABLY FOUR PLUS HOURS IN YOUR COMMITTEE SIMILAR AMOUNTS OF TIME. WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE DEPTH OF THE POLICY DISCUSSION OTHER WE'RE ABLE TO HAVE SO THANK YOU CENTER -- THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS DO SUBSTANTIALLY ALTER THE BILL I DON'T PRETEND LIKE THEY DOUBT -- WE ARE STILL OPPOSED TO THE BILL I AND AND IT'S FOR ONE MAJOR REASON -- AND THAT IS THAT WE JUST DON'T SEE HOW THE BILL. ADDRESSES THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THE STIGMA OF FILING THESE TYPES OF CLAIMS ARE SEEKING THIS TYPE OF OF INJURY AND CENTER I'VE HAVE HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT THIS. IN THE ANALYSIS IT SAYS THAT THERE'S A 26% RATE THE DATA THAT THE SPONSORS POINT TO THAT THERE'S A 26% RATE OF CLINICAL DEPRESSION. BUT WE ONLY SEE ABOUT ONE POINT THREE ONE POINT 4% OF FIREFIGHTERS FILING CLAIMS. SO IF YOU CHANGE THE PRESUMPTION WHICH IS BASICALLY HOW THE OPERATION OF OF THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM EXISTS WHAT THE STANDARD IS FOR ACCEPTING A CLAIM. IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING FOR THOSE POLICE OFFICERS WHO SIMPLY ARE NOT FILING THE CLAIMS. SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A DISCONNECT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE BETWEEN THE PROBLEM THAT'S BEING DESCRIBED AND ULTIMATELY THE SOLUTION THAT'S CONTAINED WITHIN THE BILL. AND THAT'S A MAJOR REASON FOR OPPOSITION HERE I'M GONNA DO AND MAKE A COUPLE MORE OBSERVATIONS ABOUT WHAT IS IN THE ACTUAL ANALYSIS. AND THE REASONS FOR OPPOSITION THE ANALYSIS DESCRIBES PRESUMPTIONS IS A KIND OF A FUNDAMENTAL DEVIATION FROM THE THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYERS IT REALLY IS THE LEGISLATURE. PUTTING ALL OF THEIR WEIGHT ON THE SCALE -- TO MAKE SURE THAT AN INJURY IS ACCEPTED IN IT IT IS VERY HARD -- FOR EMPLOYERS TO OVERCOME THAT PRESUMPTION SECONDARILY THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THAT WERE ONLY SUPPOSED TO REALLY DO THIS IN UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE IT'S THE OPERATION OF THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM. THAT IS THE PROBLEM. AND THEN THE ANALYSIS GOES ON TO POINT OUT THAT THERE IS NO DATA THERE IS NO DATA THAT SUGGESTS THAT THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM IS DYSFUNCTIONAL IN DEALING WITH THESE PARTICULAR CLAIMS -- AND THAT JUST LEAVES US BECAUSE OF THAT WEIGHT PUT ON THE SCALE IF THERE'S NO DATA AND WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE BILL'S ACTUALLY RESOLVING THE PROBLEM IS EXTRAORDINARILY PROBLEMATIC FOR US ON A ON A POLICY LEVEL TO MOVE IN THE DIRECTION OF A PRESUMPTION. I WITH THAT BEING SAID OBVIOUSLY UNDERSTAND THAT AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN TAKEN THERE'S AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN. THE SENATOR -- AND THE COMMITTEE -- AND WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL BUT AGAIN WE TALKED BEFORE THE HEARING -- AND EVEN THOUGH THE BILL'S MOVING OUT OF COMMITTEE WE'RE GONNA KEEP THE CONVERSATION ALIVE AND KEEP THE DISCUSSION ALIVE AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT SO. THANK YOU AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS GOOD THANK YOU. GO AHEAD MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS STATE FOR JUST ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY IS FOR LOOKING FORWARD TO REVIEWING THE BILL AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED. AND YOU BELIEVE THAT THE AND THEN MET SUGGESTED IN THE ANALYSIS ARE A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR AND STAFF AS WELL AS THE SENATOR AND HIS STAFF FOR BEING VERY GENEROUS WITH THEIR TINY MEETING WITH US. THROUGHOUT THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS TO DISCUSS THESE IMPORTANT POLICY MATTERS. WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH HIS OFFICE AND TO REACH THE OBJECTIVE OF THE DRESSING OCCUPATIONAL STRESS AND TIMELY AND EFFECTIVE MEDICAL CARE. AND OUR GOAL IS PUBLIC EMPLOYERS IS ALWAYS TO HELP INJURED WORKERS RECEIVE APPROPRIATE EVIDENCE BASED CARE AND TO HELP THEM RETURN TO WORK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. PUBLIC EMPLOYEES TAKE EMPLOYERS EXCUSE ME TAKE THAT DUTY VERY SERIOUSLY TO ENSURE THAT ALL WORKERS HAVE APPROPRIATE BENEFITS AND COMPENSATION AND WE DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT THESE CLAIMS ARE BEING TREATED UNFAIRLY OR OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE LABOR CODE. WE WELCOME THE ADDITIONAL REVIEW BY CHANCE MAKE AND WE'D BE HAPPY TO PARTNER WITH THE AUTHOR IN THE COMMITTEE ON A BROADER CONVERSATION ABOUT PRESUMPTION ELIGIBILITY. THAT EXAMINES THE IMPACT THAT THAT HAS ON INJURED WORKERS AND ON LOCAL BUDGETS PRIOR TO FURTHER EXPANSION OF THESE BENEFITS THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER PERSONS -- OPPOSED TO OR A OR A TWEETERS GOES AS CHAIR MEMBERS JR MEMBERS ABOUT THE A ERICA PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE ASSOCIATION APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THE COMMITTEES DONE THE AMENDMENTS THE AUTHORS TAKE AND WE ASSOCIATE OUR COMMENTS WITH -- MISTER SCHMELZER MS LANE THANK YOU.

PHIL VERMAELEN REPRESENTING -- ALLIED MANAGE CARE AN ACCLAMATION INSURANCE MANAGEMENT SERVICES -- WE TO BELIEVE IT'S GETTING CLOSER BUT WE STILL HAVE SOME MAJOR CONCERNS WITH THE BILL -- AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING ON TRYING TO COME UP WITH SOME AMENDMENTS THANK YOU. OF COMMITTEE MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR OR FOR THE WITNESSES MISTER FRAZIER. YOU KNOW I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE WE'VE HAD PUBLIC SAFETY UP BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. UNLESS YOU'VE BEEN A BENEFACTOR FROM PUBLIC SAFETY OR OR FIRE. YOU DON'T REALLY GET IT -- WHAT THEY GO THROUGH I'VE GONE ON TWENTY FOUR HOUR RIDE ALONGS WITH FIRE DEPARTMENTS? OF SEEING WHAT HAS. AN AFFECT ON THEIR MENTAL HEALTH IS ACTUALLY DEVASTATING WHEN THEY REACH. THESE TERMINAL CANCER PATIENTS WHO HAVE A DNR AND AND THEIR WHOLE FIRST INSTINCT IS TO SAY THAT INDIVIDUAL AND THEY CAN'T. OR THAT CHILD THEY COME ON ON THE ACCIDENT SCENE. THAT IS IS DECEASED. UNLESS YOU'RE THERE YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH. AND WITH THAT'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY. THANK YOU SIR ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MISTER GRAYSON JUST QUICKLY COMMENT -- SERVING AS A CRITICAL RESPONSE CHAPLAIN I WILL CONCUR WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM OAKLEY THAT -- THE THE EFFECTS AND THE TRAUMA THAT IS -- THAT IS IMPACTFUL ON A FIRST RESPONDERS LIFE IS BUT AND DESCRIBABLE SO -- I WILL BE DEFINITELY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL TODAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR GOOD WORK AND APPLAUD THE AUTHOR. THANK YOU AND MISTER BIGELOW HAS A COMMON. YEAH MAYBE THAT'S WHAT IT IS IT'S MORE COMMON THAN A THAN A QUESTION MISTER STEARNS I WANNA. FIRST OF ALL. TAKE THE LEAP OUT HERE AND JUST SAY THANK YOU A GREAT DEAL BUT I I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR HAVING THE WITNESS THAT CAME UP TODAY TO SPEAK HIS HEART AND HIS MIND. AND KIND OF CONTESTED. BEFORE ALL OF US THE TRAUMA AND THE ISSUES THAT HE'S FACING AND HE WILL CONTINUE TO FACE AS HE MOVES FORWARD. I UNDERSTAND THOSE ON A MORE PERSONAL LEVEL THAN PROBABLY MOST ARE AROUND THIS TABLE. BECAUSE AS A FORTY SEVEN YEAR MEMBER OF A A FIRE DEPARTMENT AND HAVING SERVED IN ALMOST EVERY. TO PASS TO YOU THAT THERE IS AND SEEN EVERYTHING AND THERE IS. NO INTO THAT EVERYTHING -- I'VE WITNESSED FELLOW MEMBERS OF THE FIRE DEPARTMENT -- ADDED VEHICLE ACCIDENT ACTUALLY. TAKE OFF THEIR GEAR AND LEAVE BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T BECAUSE IT WAS SO VIOLENT. IT WAS SO TERRIFIC -- IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DEAL WITH. AND THE ONLY ONE LEFT TO DEAL WITH IT WAS MYSELF. AND IT'S BEEN THE CASE TIME AND TIME AGAIN BECAUSE I WAS ONE OF THOSE TYPE. THEY COULD TAKE THAT. TYPE OF ISSUE AND AND AND ADDRESS IT. WHEN YOU FACE? THE ISSUE OF A A FIREMAN WHO HAVE TO GO OVER A CLIFF THAT'S FULL OF RATTLE SNAKES. TO TAKE AND REMOVE THE BODY. ONLY TO FIND OUT. THAT THE FATHER WAS MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE DOG AND HIS WIFE. AND I DID NOT MENTION THE FACT THAT IS NEW INFANT IS NEWBORN INFANT WAS IN THE ROCKS THANK GOD. THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE IN GOD SO MUCH. THAT BABY SURVIVED. BECAUSE WE WENT BACK WE FOUND IT NOT HURT. AND EVEN MORE OF A BLESSING WAS A GRANDMOTHER THAT SHOWED UP. AND SHE WAS ABLE TO GIVE THAT NURTURING CARE UNTIL WE HAD MEDICAL SERVICES A RIDE BECAUSE IN A RURAL AREA. SOMETIMES IT TAKES FORTY FIVE MINUTES TO AN HOUR BEFORE THAT AMBULANCE GET THEIR AND WE NEEDED TO TRANSPORT. NOW UNFORTUNATELY. THIS IS THE ONE AND ONLY TIME CASE WHERE I LOST MY TEMPER AT AN INCIDENT. EVEN THE ONE WHERE THE GUY THAT ALMOST HIT ME. THAT WE SPOKE ABOUT YESTERDAY -- IN COMMITTEE WHEN I WAS CAMARO CARRYING A BILL. THAT ALMOST RAN OVER ME AS A A TRAFFIC -- MANAGER -- THAT ONE DIDN'T BOTHER ME. BUT THE GUY THAT ASKED ABOUT HIS DOG AND HIS WIFE AND KID. I TOLD THE OFFICER TAKEN AWAY IS ABOUT TO BECOME A WERE STATE FORM. I TELL YOU. THERE IS THOSE CASES WHERE THERE ARE THERE ARE THE OTHER CASES. THE CASES THAT WE DON'T SEE. OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE AT HOME DWELLING. PONDERING AND GOING THROUGH THAT TRAUMATIC ISSUE AND DON'T ASK FOR HELP. THAT IS THE STATEMENT THAT WAS MADE HERE THAT EVERY MEMBER SHOULD LISTEN TO AND HERE. AND RALLY AROUND THIS BILL. THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE LIVES. THAT. WHILE WE'RE DEALING WITH THE TRAUMA DRAMATIC ISSUES OF LIVES. THOSE ARE THE FOLKS WHO AS A RESIDUAL AND IT DOESN'T MATERIALIZE SOMETIMES UNTIL DAYS OR YEARS. LATER. SO I THINK WE ALL SHOULD TAKE A MOMENT TO REALLY PONDER ON THIS BILL. I KNOW THAT -- YOU HAVEN'T TAKEN EVERY -- A MEMBER TO EVERYONE'S SATISFACTION -- CERTAINLY BUT FOR ME TODAY IF I CAN HELP THE THE MEMBERS OF THE SERVICE.

THIS SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT IS AFFORDED TO ALL OFFICER STATE WIDE AND IN PARTICULAR THIS BILL -- WOULD CORRECT -- PRESUMPTIONS THAT ARE MADE WERE SPECIFIC INJURIES OR ILLNESSES ARE. LOGICALLY WORK RELATED BUT GENERALLY AFFORDED OF PRESUMPTIONS TO PEACE OFFICERS BASED ON THEIR WE WHERE THEY WORK MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE AND AND THEN AGAIN THIS THIS BILL WOULD WOULD CORRECT THAT TO OFFER THIS. IS A BENEFIT TO ALL PEACE OFFICERS IN STATE [inaudible] OF THEY DESERVE TO BE OF AFFORDED OF THESE IMPORTANT PRESUMPTIONS CONCERNING. INJURIES ON THE JOB.

MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I'VE BEEN ALL TOMORROW ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATEWIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSOCIATION -- WE THANK YOU FOR THE COMMITTEE THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS FOR WORKING WITH US ON AMENDMENTS ON THE BILL THANK YOU. AS CHAIR MEMBERS RYAN SHERMAN WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION ALSO IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. MATTHEW CYBERLINK I'LL BE OUT THE LOS ANGELES PROBATION OFFICERS UNION ASK ME LOCAL SIX EIGHTY FIVE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. HI MY NAME IS -- SERGEANT ELMER MARS AND RETIRED SERGEANT IN SECOND PLACE APARTMENT -- THIRTY TWO YEARS OF SERVICE -- CURRENTLY WITH THE SEGMENT COUNTY PARK RANGER -- RECREATION DIVISION. AND WHEN I WENT FOR RETIRED FROM SACRAMENTO POLICE DEPARTMENT WITH THE NORMAL WORKMAN'S COMP. PRESUMPTION -- SUPPORT I GUESS. AND THEN WENT TO THE COUNTY RANGERS AND STUFF FOUND OUT THAT THERE WERE TWO DIFFERENT PEACE OFFICER CLASSIFICATIONS. AND THE ASSUMPTION THAT I MADE WAS THAT I WAS COVERED IN CASE I GOT INJURED AND STUFF ON THE JOB AND STEP AND APPARENTLY I WASN'T. AND THIS BILL CORRECTS THAT AND WE'RE DEFINITELY STRONG SUPPORT. MY NAME'S A LAUNDRY ON THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY PARK RANGERS AND A STRONG SUPPORT YEAH. ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER PERSONS -- HERE TO SPEAK AGAINST THE BILL ALL RIGHT. I SEE. TO PLEASE GO AHEAD SIR. JOSH DUGGAR REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES -- SO I WANT TO START BY SAYING WE HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR THE PEACE OFFICERS COVERED BY THIS BILL THAT ARE DEFINITELY DOING IMPORTANT WORK. AS EMPLOYERS AS WAS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED -- IN A PRIOR DISCUSSION OUR GOALS HELP WORKERS OBTAIN APPROPRIATE MEDICAL TREATMENT AND RETURNED TO WORK. OUR OPPOSITION ON THIS BILL IS REALLY CENTERED UPON THE SIMPLE FACT THAT A PRESUMPTION IS NOT REQUIRED OR NECESSARY FOR INJURED WORKERS TO HAVE A SUCCESSFUL WORKERS COMP CLAIM. CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT WORKERS COMP SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO FAVOR INJURED WORKERS IF THERE'S A DISPUTE REGARDING A CLAIM AND CONNECTION OF THE INJURY TO WORK. AND ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE FOLLOWS LABOR CODE THIRTY TWO OH TWO WHICH STATE STATUTE SHALL BE LIBERALLY CONSTRUED WITH THE PURPOSE OF EXTENDING BENEFITS TO THE INDIVIDUAL. WE ALSO WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THIS IS NOT JUST TECHNICAL CLEAN UP OF INADVERTENTLY OMITTED PEACE OFFICERS. CURRENT LAW INCLUDES AND EXCLUDE CERTAIN PEACE OFFICERS FROM PRESUMPTIONS BASED ON PRIOR LEGISLATION AND AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THIS BILL ALSO CHOOSES TO CONTINUE TO EXCLUDE CERTAIN PEACE OFFICERS. SO THIS IS NOT TECHNICAL CLEAN UP IT'S A COSTLY EXPANSION OF PRESUMPTIONS TO ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATIONS OF OFFICERS WITHOUT AN OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS OF THE SIMILARITIES OR DIFFERENCES OF THE JOB DUTIES OR RATES OF THE ILES UNDER THE EXISTING WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM. WHEN IT COMES TO PRESUMPTIONS WE THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO STUDY THE DATA INJURY RATES OF DENIAL HOW ARE THINGS OCCURRING WITHIN THE EXISTING SYSTEM BEFORE CHANGING A SYSTEM? SO WE WOULD WELCOME THAT KIND OF STUDY OR REVIEW BUT UNTIL THAT. TIME WE WOULD REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE COST AN INVESTIGATIVE DUTIES THIS WOULD CAUSE FOR EMPLOYERS. THANK YOU GO HEAD MISTER SCHMELZER. ADDRESS CHAIR MEMBERS AT JASON SHELTER HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION ON WORKERS COMPENSATION ADDS ONE ADDRESS ONE COMMENT THAT WAS MADE -- THE GENTLEMAN ASSERTED THAT FOLKS ARE COVERED BY THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM I I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT ALL EMPLOYEES ARE COVERED BY THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND WHAT IT WOULD CORRECT IN A SENSE -- IS IT PUTS THE WEIGHT ON THE SCALE AGAIN IT CHANGES THE BURDEN OF PROOF -- FROM AN EMPLOYEE HAVING TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY WERE HEARD IN THE COURSE AND SCOPE OF THEIR JOB. A TO ESSENTIALLY REQUIRING THE EMPLOYER TO PROVE THAT THEY WORKED AT THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE HERE -- BUT AS FAR AS COVERAGE GOES -- ALL EMPLOYEES ARE COVERED -- I'LL BE VERY BRIEF AFTER THAT I DON'T REPEAT MYSELF TOO MUCH AND IN ONE DAY. AT THE END OF THE POLICY COMMITTEE PROCESS BUT I GO BACK TO THE ANALYSIS AGAIN -- YOU KNOW TALKING ABOUT HOW PRESUMPTIONS -- ARE A DEVIATION FROM KIND OF THIS GRAND BARGAIN THAT EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES HAVE -- BECAUSE OF THE WEIGHT THAT IT'S PUTTING ON THE SCALE THAT IT SHOULD BE DONE ONLY UNDER UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE IT'S DEMONSTRATED THAT THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM ISN'T WORKING. AND IT SHOULD BE BASED ON DATA AND THEN AGAIN THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THAT THERE IS REALLY NO DATA HERE -- STORE OPPOSE FOR THOSE REASONS I AND WE ARE YOU KNOW VOTE TODAY THE HAPPY ANSWERING QUESTIONS. THANK YOU OTHER PERSONS AGAINST THE BILL. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS YOUR MEMBERS ABOUT THE AMERICAN PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE ASSOCIATION SO THEATER COMMENTS WITH THE COUNTIES IN C. CWC.

IF NOT SENATOR YOU CAN CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT WERE OF WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS FILED BY PEACE OFFICERS. NOT CURLY AFFORDED THESE PRESUMPTIONS ABOUT 15% OF THOSE CLAIMS ARE DENIED FOR THESE SPECIFIC OFFICERS ASSISTANCE NOT WORKING THIS IS THE ONE THIS BILL -- IS SIX TWO CORRECT. AND YOU KNOW JUST GENERALLY A LOT OF THESE -- CLASSIFICATIONS. I HAVE EVOLVED OVER TIME WERE ADDITIONAL DUTIES OF PEACEKEEPING DUTIES HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO THESE CLASSIFICATIONS SO THEY'RE IN ESSENCE POLICE OFFICERS WHO ARE BE PICKED. BECAUSE OF A SIMPLE LOOPHOLE ARE NOT BEING DIVIDE -- PROVIDED -- THE THE SAME -- PROVISIONS OF US SUPPORT THAN OTHER POLICE OFFICERS OF OTHER CLASSIFICATIONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.
