ASSEMBLY BILL ONE TWENTY SEVEN BY SENATOR COM WALKER AN ACT RELATING TO REST WARRANTS. SENATOR COME OVER THE FLOOR GEORGE THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT GOOD MORNING. TO YOU AND MEMBERS I AM PRESENTING AB ONE TWENTY SEVEN WHICH AMENDS THE CALIFORNIA STATE PENAL CODE TO PERMIT AN EMPLOYEE OF A PUBLIC PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE TO PRESENT A PROBABLE CAUSE DETERMINATION TO A JUDGE. AND SEEKING AN ARREST WARRANT IN CASES WHEN THE SUBJECT IS A PEACE OFFICER THE AIM IS SIMPLY TO REDUCE PROCEDURAL BARRIERS TO POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY BY ELIMINATING ONE OF THEM- FOR DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND INITIATING PROSECUTIONS AGAINST MEMBERS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. EIGHTY ONE TWENTY SEVEN WILL CLARIFY THAT A DECLARATION OF PROBABLE CAUSE FOR AN ARREST WARRANT. NEED NOT BE PROVIDED ONLY BY A PEACE OFFICER BUT COULD ALSO BE PROVIDED BY A PROSECUTOR. THE PROPOSED CHANGE IN LAW MAKES NO OTHER CHANGES TO THE PROCESS OF OBTAINING AN ARREST WARRANT BEYOND THE EXPANSION OF POSSIBLE OFFENSE BEYOND PEACE OFFICERS IT WOULD NOT CHANGE THE PROBABLE CAUSE STANDARD OF PROOF AND JUDGES WOULD STILL RETAIN THE AUTHORITY TO ISSUE AN ARREST WARRANT. EIGHTY ONE TWENTY SEVEN IS SUPPORTED BY NUMEROUS ORGANIZATIONS IT RECEIVED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN THE ASSEMBLY AND HAS NO OPPOSITION I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN IPO.
