THANK YOU SIR YOU MAY PROCEED WITH YOUR NEXT BILL OR YOUR BILL ASSEMBLY BILL ONE TWO EIGHT TWO WHEN YOU ARE READY THANK YOU I HAD THAT IS- FILE ORDER NUMBER ONE SO MAYBE I GOT THE NUMBERS IN REVERSE BUT TO BE CLEAR- THE- BILL THAT I'M- PROCEEDING ON TODAY'S AB TWELVE EIGHTY TWO. THE CALIFORNIA PET BLOOD MODERNIZATION ACT AND THE BILL THAT'S BEING REMOVED AS AB ONE OH THREE FOUR. THAT IS CORRECT THANK THANK YOU MR CHAIR AT THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FIRST LET ME THANK. BNP AND ACT COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING CLOSELY WITH MY OFFICE ON THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE DEVELOPED IN COLLABORATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS. WE'VE MADE GREAT STRIDES TOWARDS RESOLVING THE REMAINING ISSUES IN THE BILL WITH THEIR HEALTH. EIGHTY TWELVE EIGHTY TWO THE CALIFORNIA PET BLOOD BANK MODERNIZATION ACT SEEKS TO ADDRESS BOTH THE SHORTAGE OF ANIMAL BLOOD FOR VETERINARY TRANSFUSION MEDICINE. HAND THE OBSOLETE IN HUMANE AND ULTIMATELY LIMITING PRACTICE OF CAPTIVE CLOSED COLONY CANINE BLOOD BANKS IN CALIFORNIA. THE BILL AUTHORIZES LICENSED VETERINARIANS TO OPERATE COMMUNITY BLOOD BANKS THAT PRODUCE AND SELL ANIMAL BLOOD AND BLOOD PRODUCTS. THESE COMMUNITY BLOOD BANKS FOR ANIMALS ARE SIMILAR TO HUMAN MODELS IN THAT THEY COLLECT BLOOD FROM PETS WHOSE ONERS VOLUNTARILY CONSENT TO THE DONATION. CURRENTLY THIS VOLUNTARY COMMUNITY BASED APPROACH ISN'T ALLOWED HERE. IN FACT CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY STATE IN THE COUNTRY THAT REQUIRES ANIMAL BLOOD TO COME FROM SO CALLED CLOSED COLONIES THAT KEEP HUNDREDS OF ANIMALS IN CONFINEMENT FOR YEARS. FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF HARVESTING THEIR BLOOD. THERE HAVE ONLY EVER BEEN TO AN EIGHTIES THAT HAVE OPERATED SUCH A BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA. AND MEANWHILE DEMAND FOR ANIMAL BLOOD VASTLY OUTSTRIPS THIS CLOSE CALL IN THE SUPPLY AND VETERINARIANS ARE REGULARLY FACED WITH A LACK OF LIFE SAVING PRODUCTS TO PERFORM TRANSFUSIONS. AND RESPOND TO EMERGENCIES. AB TWELVE EIGHTY TWO PROVIDES A HUMANE SOLUTION FOR SOURCING ANIMAL BLOOD WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY ADDRESSING THE SUPPLY SHORTAGE AND ESTABLISHING CONDITIONS TO EVENTUALLY PHASE OUT CAPTIVE CLOSE CALL IN THE CANINE BLOOD BANKS. AB TWELVE EIGHTY TWO ADDRESSES THE GOVERNOR'S TWENTY NINETEEN VETO OF SB TWO OH TWO BY PROVIDING A TRANSITION AWAY FROM THE USE OF CAPTIVE CLOSE CALL IN THE CANINE BLOOD BANKS IN CALIFORNIA. ONLY PHASING THEM OUT ONCE THE AMOUNT OF DOG BLOOD COMMUNITY BANK SELL EQUALS OR EXCEEDS THE AMOUNT THE CLOSE CALL ON THE CELL. OF FOUR CONSECUTIVE QUARTERS THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT SENATOR WELL CAN I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON PASSIONATELY FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE APPROACH THAT VETERINARIANS ANIMAL WELFARE INTERESTS IN THE AFFECTED STATE DEPARTMENTS CAN ALL AGREE WILL PUT CALIFORNIA ON A PATH TO AN ETHICALLY SOURCED SAFE AND EXPANDED. ANIMAL BLOOD SUPPLY. EARLIER THIS MONTH AB TWELVE EIGHTY TWO PASSED OUT OF THE SENATE AGRICULTURAL COMMITTEE WITH UNANIMOUS SUPPORT. IN THE MOST RECENT SET OF AMENDMENTS TO AB TWELVE EIGHTY TWO CONSISTENCE AND TECHNICAL COOK CORRECTIONS OR CONFORMING AMENDMENTS BUT ALSO PROVIDED SIMPLIFIED SOLUTIONS TO THE LAST OUTSTANDING SUBSTANTIVE ISSUE AND THIS INCLUDES IMPROVING THE TRIGGER FOR WHEN WE WILL TRANSITION AWAY FROM CLOSE COLONIES.

ABOUT ALL THAT- DOCTOR BERGER- ADD COMMENTS OR ANYTHING ON IT MAYBE I CAN GIVE SOME YOU KNOW IN SOME FOR DOCTOR BERGER YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE SAYING THAT THAT THE TWO COMPANIES THAT DO THIS NOW CAN PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. I GUESS THE BOTTOM LINE IS OUR PROFIT- CENTER IS- PROFIT OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM IF THEY CONTINUE TO PARTICIPATE.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M PROUD TO PRESENT BY TESTIMONY ONLY EIGHTY FOUR FOUR THREE WHICH AIMS TO CREATE A PATHWAY TO ALLOW FOREIGN MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS AND MEDICAL GRADUATES TO WORK IN CALIFORNIA'S UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES TO PROVIDE. PATIENT CARE. PATIENT CARE SUPPORT THE REFLECTS CALIFORNIA'S LINGUISTIC DIVERSITY THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC MADE IT CLEAR THAT ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE IS TRULY. A LIFE OR DATH ISSUE ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES WERE OVER REPRESENTED. IN NOT ONLY CALL THE NINETEEN CASES BUT IN MORTALITY RATES AND LONG TERM COMPLICATIONS. THE ROOT OF THESE OUTCOMES OUTCOME DISPARITIES. WE TOOK GREAT STEPS IN THE BUDGET THIS YEAR TO GET MORE OF OUR STATE'S RESIDENTS ACCESS TO MEDICAL. BUT HOW USEFUL THAT B. TWO ARE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PROVIDERS AVAILABLE. ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE COMMISSION SEVEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS ALMOST ONE IN SIX LIVE IN AN AREA WITH A SWORD A SHORTAGE OF PROVIDERS. THOUGH SHORTAGES ARE CONCENTRATED IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR MAKING THE NEED FOR MULTI LINGUAL PHYSICIANS AND EVEN MORE ACUTE ONE. CALIFORNIA LAGS SIGNIFICANTLY BEHIND OTHER LARGE STATES. AND THE NATION AND THE RATIO OF LATINO PHYSICIANS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO OUR SPANISH SPEAKING RESIDENTS. A TWENTY NINETEEN STUDY FROM UCLA FOUND THAT THERE WERE ONLY SIX POINT TO LET THE KNOW PHYSICIANS AVAILABLE FOR EVERY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND SPANISH SPEAKING CALIFORNIANS. FOR THE NATION THAT WHOLE RATIO IS SIX TIMES GREATER. THIS LAST YEAR WE HAVE FACED A PANDEMIC AND NOW IS THE VACCINE IS WIDELY AVAILABLE WE HAVE SEEN HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO HAVE CULTURALLY. COMPETENT POSITIONS THAT CAN BUILD RELATIONSHIPS. WITH AND ADVOCATE FOR COMMUNITIES THAT ARE UNDERSERVED IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM REPEATED STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THE NON ENGLISH SPEAKING PATIENTS SEE MORE POSITIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES. WHEN THEY'RE CARED FOR BY A LINGUISTIC. AND CULTURALLY COMPETENT PROVIDERS. RIGHT NOW CALIFORNIA DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH OF THOSE PROVIDERS AVAILABLE CREATING A PATHWAY FOR EXPERIENCE FOR MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS AND MEDICAL GRADUATES TO WORK WITH UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS.IN THE LANGUAGE THAT THEY SPEAK WILL ENSURE THAT THESE PROFESSIONALS ARE WORKING UNDER SUPERVISION AND THAT SUFFICIENT PATIENT SAFEGUARDS ARE IN PLACE.

CANNABIS BEVERAGES ARE THE FASTEST GROWING SECTOR OF THE INDUSTRY BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE MANUFACTURERS FIND THEMSELVES HAVING TO ABIDE BY PACKAGING LANGUAGE THAT WAS SIGNED FOR EDIBLES SMOKEABLE PRODUCTS AND FLOWER. THIS IS CONFIDENTIAL EXPENSES IN PRODUCING CANNABIS BEVERAGES BY FORCING PRODUCERS TO SOURCE COMPLYING GLASS MATERIALS SUCH AS IMPORTING GLASS BOTTLES FROM THE STATE. BRENDAN WORK WITH LOCAL CALIFORNIAN VENDORS FOR HAVING BOTTLES HAND PAINTED TO MEET THE OPACITY REQUIREMENTS THIS WILL PASS REQUIREMENT IS UNNECESSARILY DRIVING UP THE COST OF GOODS FOR TERRORIST PURPOSES PRODUCERS AND DRIVING BUSINESSES TO FORM PRODUCED ABOUT OFFERING ANY.

HI I'M I'M SORRY I WAS HAVING TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES AND HAD- HAD TO DIAL BACK IN- I'M ACTUALLY HERE TO- RIGHT THEY'VE BEEN ON BEHALF OF THE BILL IS THAT OKAY. PLEASE PROCEED. OKAY SO- MY NAME'S MAKAI POLANSKI ON BEHALF OF THE CANNABIS BEVERAGE ASSOCIATION AND I'M HERE TO- ADVOCATE THAT WE STRONGLY SUPPORT OUR SPONSORED MEASURE AB TWELVE TWENTY TWO RELATING TO THE FOLLOWING. CANNABIS BEVERAGE PRODUCTS- THE BILL EXEMPTS HIM WITH BEVERAGES FROM THE OPAQUE PACKAGING REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY REQUIRED FOR ALL ANIMALS AND WOULD INSTEAD AUTHORIZED CANNABIS BEVERAGES TO BE PACKAGED IN A GLASS CONTAINER THAT IS CLEAR. OR ANY OTHER COLOR TO MEET THIS REQUIREMENT. WELL TWENTY TWO IS MUCH MEASURE BECAUSE WHEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED THE GOVERNOR BROWN SIGNED- AND MEDICINAL AND ADULT USE CANNABIS REGULATION AND SAFETY ACT- OCCURRED. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE CANNABIS BEVERAGE SECTOR WITH THE NAVY AND PART OF THE INDUSTRY. IT WAS SO SMALL THAT WHEN THE INITIAL PACKAGING LAWS AND REGULATIONS WERE FORMULATED THE UNIQUE AND SPECIFIC NEEDS OF THE CANNABIS BEVERAGE PACKAGING. FOR UNFORTUNATELY NOT TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. TODAY THE CANNABIS BEVERAGE SECTOR IS NOW THE FASTEST GROWING SECTOR WITHIN THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE MANUFACTURER FIND THEMSELVES HAVING TO ABIDE BY PACKAGING LANGUAGE THAT WAS DESIGNED FOR EDIBLE. MOBILES AND FLOWER UNFORTUNATELY GIVEN THE UNIQUE NATURE OF BEVERAGES. THIS HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING AND BECAUSE OF THE COST A TRUE BARRIER TO ENTRY FOR MANY CANNABIS BEVERAGE BRANDS AND MANUFACTURERS. WHAT THE BILL SPECIFICALLY DOES THAT ALLOW CANNABIS BEVERAGES TO BE BOTTLED. IN CLEAR OR ANY OTHER COLOR CONTAINER. A GOOD THING WHERE YOU. ARE THAT CANNABIS. B. AND BOTTLED. BOTTLES THAT ARE OPAQUE OR AMBER COLORED AMBER GLASS WALL COMMONLY AVAILABLE FOR BEER BOTTLES IT'S NOT READILY AVAILABLE IN THE U. S. FOR MOST OTHER BOTTLE DESIGN SHAPES AND SIZES. THIS KIND OF COMPETITION- EXPENSES IN PRODUCING CANNABIS BEVERAGES BY FORCING PRODUCERS TO SOURCE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE CHERRY OFFICE SAYS IMPORTING GLASS BOTTLES FROM EUROPE RATHER THAN WORKING WITH LOCAL CALIFORNIA VENDORS OR HAVING BOTTLED HAND PAINTED TO MEET YOUR PATH YOUR REQUIREMENT. IT'S ABOUT THE REQUIREMENT IT IS UNNECESSARILY DRIVING UP THE COST OF GOODS FOR CANNABIS BEVERAGE PRODUCERS AND DRIVING BUSINESS FIFTY FOREIGN PRODUCERS WITHOUT OFFERING ANY BENEFIT TO THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. FOR THE REASONS STATED ABOVE THE CDA URGES AND I HOPE FOR A B. TWELVE TWENTY TWO I FELT CAN WHEN IT IS CONSIDERED IN THE. SENATE COMMITTEE ON BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONALS. THANK YOU NEXT PLEASE.

SIR WELCOME YOUR ONE BUILDER PRESENT TODAY ITS ASSEMBLY BILL NINE FIFTEEN PLEASE PROCEED IN READING THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN GOOD MORNING SENATORS APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION TODAY OF A. B. NINE FIFTEEN A BILL THAT WILL HELP OUR STATE LIVE UP TO ITS PROMISE TO SUPPORT OUR SMALL DIVERSE BUSINESSES. AS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD CALIFORNIA HAS ENORMOUS PURCHASING POWER. AND WE SHOULD USE THAT POWER TO HELP SMALL MICRO BUSINESSES WHO'VE TAKEN THE LARGEST ECONOMIC HIT DURING CALL OF IT. AND ARE STILL STRUGGLING TO RECOVER ON A DAILY BASIS. IN TWO THOUSAND SIX GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT ESTABLISHED A GOAL FOR ALL STATE AGENCIES THAT 25% OF ALL CONTRACTS. SHOULD GO TO CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESSES. SINCE THEN AGENCIES HAVE LARGELY IGNORED THAT EXECUTIVE ORDER. OF THE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY ONE STATE AGENCIES DEPARTMENTS AND COMMISSIONS ONLY TWELVE HAVE ADOPTED A SMALL BUSINESS OR DISABLED VETERANS BUSINESS ENTERPRISE POLICY. GIVEN THE HIT THE SMALL BUSINESSES PARTICULARLY DIVERSE AND MINORITY OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES AND MICRO BUSINESSES DURING THIS PANDEMIC WE SQUANDER REAL OPPORTUNITY TO HELP THOSE BUSINESSESON THEIR AMERICAN DREAM. THIS BILL WOULD CODIFY THAT 25% GO INTO LAW AND CREATE A FASTTRACK CERTIFICATION FOR DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENTERPRISES. THIS BILL ALSO LOOKS AT SMALL BUSINESS SURVIVAL THROUGH AN EQUITY LENS BY CREATING AN ECONOMIC EQUITY FIRST EXPECTATION. THAT REQUIRES STATE AGENCIES TO DEVELOP EQUITY PLANS FOR PROCURING GOODS FROM DVDS. I NOW LIKE TO TURN THINGS OVER TO OUR MAIN WITNESS DAVID NELSON WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASIAN PACIFIC CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. MR NELSON PLEASE PROCEED.

AS OF JUST LAST MONTH- DATA THAT GOES INTO THE CALIFORNIA DREAMIN DECKS 41% OF BUSINESSES IN THE STATE ARE STILL NOT OPEN. FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC LAST YEAR. AND WE KNOW THAT CONTRACTING CAN BE THE LIFEBLOOD OF SUCCESS FOR ANY BUSINESS SMALL OR LARGE. AND AT A CONTRACT WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THIS BILL MODERNIZES OUR STATE DEFINITION OF A HOUSEHOLD GOODS MOVERS. BY PROVIDING THE SAME LIMITED SERVICES EXCLUSION THAT EXIST CURRENTLY IN FEDERAL LAW FOR QUALIFIED MOTOR CARRIERS. MOTOR CARRIERS IN THE SELF MOVING SERVICE INDUSTRY OFFER CONSUMERS A SAFE RELIABLE AND COST EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVE FOR MOVING GOODS. THIS BILL IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT THESE MOTOR CARRIERS. CAN CONTINUE THEIR REGULAR OPERATIONS WITHOUT ON RELATED REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS WITH ME TODAY ARE CHRISTIAN MOTOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA TRUCKING ASSOCIATION AND SHANE GUSMAN WITH THE TEAMSTERS. WHO WILL BE SPEAKING IN SUPPORT AND WHO ARE CO SPONSORS OF THE BILL. WITNESSES PLEASE PROCEED. MORE INSURER FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS KRISH MOTIVE FOR CALIFORNIA TRUCKING ASSOCIATION IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN THE HOUSEHOLD MOVERS ACCEPTED RESPONSIBILITY FOR OVERSIGHT OF THE MOVING INDUSTRY FROM THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO THE BEER OF HOUSEHOLD GOODS AND SERVICES IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACT HAS BROUGHT TO LIGHT INCONSISTENCIES WITH LONGSTANDING FEDERAL LAW THAT WE SEEK TO RESOLVE. EIGHTY TWO TO FOUR UPDATES CALIFORNIA LAW TO REFLECT ACTION TAKEN BY CONGRESS IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE TO GIVE CONSUMERS A LOWER COST ALTERNATIVE TO TRADITIONAL HOUSEHOLD MOVERS BY EXPANDING CONSUMER CHOICE AND COMPETITION UNDER FEDERAL LAW TRUCKING COMPANIES ARE AUTHORIZED TO PERFORM A LIMITED RANGE OF SELF MOVING SERVICES PURSUANT TO THEIR MOTOR CARRIER AUTHORITY. BY UTILIZING THE HIGHLY EFFICIENT FREIGHT NETWORKS OF LESS THAN TRUCKLOAD MOTOR CARRIERS SELF MOVING PROVIDES CONSIDER CONSUMERS AS MUCH AS A MOVERS EIGHTY TWO TO FOUR SIMPLY ALIGNED STATE AND FEDERAL LAW WITH RESPECT TO A NARROW SET OF SELF MOVING SERVICES AND IN DOING SO PROVIDES CALIFORNIANS LOWER COST MOVING OPTIONS AND SUPPORTS WORKING CLASS TRUCKING JOBS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND RESPECTFULLY ASK. ABOUT. NEXT PLEASE. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE COMMISSION DOES NOT ON BEHALF OF THE TEAMSTERS PRATICA SPONSOR THIS BILL OUR MEMBERS PERFORM THIS WORK FOR VERY WELL CAPITALIZED TRUCKING COMPANIES- WE VIEW THIS AS A CLARIFICATION OF THE LAW SO THAT THE COMPANIES WE WORK FOR. DON'T FACE DEPLETED OF AND OVER REGULATION. AND HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE BOTTOM LINE WHICH OF COURSE HAS A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE GOOD JOBS FOR US SO WE SUPPORT THIS BILL. WE ARE GENERALLY NOT FOR EXEMPTIONS TO REGULATION BUT IN THIS INSTANCE THESE COMPANIES ARE REGULATED IN OTHER WAYS. AND I THINK IT'S VERY TELLING- ON A CONSUMER POINT OF VIEW THAT THERE ARE NO CONSUMER ORGANIZATIONS IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT AT INNER DRIVE A- THANK YOU LET'S TURN TO IN THE- ANY SUPPORT WITNESSES WHO WERE IN THE GALLERY ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE IN THE GALLERY.

OKAY LET'S FOLLOW THE SAME PROCESS AND HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION WITNESSES I UNDERSTAND WE HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE CALIFORNIA MOVING AND STORAGE ASSOCIATION ON THE LINE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION IF SO PLEASE PROCEED. H. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE STEVE WHITEY CAMP PRESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA MOVING AND STORAGE ASSOCIATION A HUNDRED AND FOUR YEAR OLD TRADE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING OVER FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MEMBER COMPANIES SERVING CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS IN THE REGULATED MOVING APARTMENTS WE WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON MAYBE THREE TO FOUR THESE LAST FEW MONTHS BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE REMAIN STRONGLY OPPOSE THIS BILL. WE APPRECIATE THE ASSESSMENT OF THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT AT THE ANALYST NOTES WE BELIEVE THE FEDERAL ARE CLEARLY GIVES CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY TO REGULATE THE TRANSPORTATION OF HOUSEHOLD GOODS WITHIN OUR BORDERS AND THE FOCUS OF EXISTING REGULATIONS IS NOT CENTERED AROUND- LOADS OR UNLOADS A TRUCK BUT RATHER THE TRANSPORT. OF HOUSEHOLD GOODS ALSO AREN'T. BUT ARE MOST AT RISK. THANKS TO CALIFORNIA REGULATIONS MOST RECENTLY ADDRESSED THE NEPHEW NINETEEN HILL. CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS THAT UTILIZE MOVING SERVICES ARE SAFER THAN CONSUMERS AROUND THE COUNTRY FROM FINANCIAL CRIMES RELATED TO SCAMMERS THAT PROLIFERATE NATIONWIDE. THIS BILL WOULD WEAKEN CONSUMER PROTECTIONS BY ALLOWING COMPANIES. ENGAGED IN TRANSPORTATION OF HOUSEHOLD GOODS SUBJECT THEMSELVES FROM STATE OVERSIGHT. THE ARGUMENT THAT THE SPONSORS PERCEIVE AS INNOVATION SHOULD ALLOW THEM TO OPERATE WITHOUT REGULATION THAT SERVE THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS SO WELL. IS A MORAL HAZARD. THE JOBS ARGUMENT IS PURE SOPHISTRY ENACTMENT OF THIS BILL WOULD ONLY MOVE JOBS FROM THE REGULATED COMPANIES TO FUND REGULATED CREATING NO NEW JOBS. ADDITIONALLY BE HARD FOR ME TO MOVERS HAVE SERVED AS ESSENTIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS. BEGINNING A STATEWIDE SHELTER IN PLACE ORDERS. DATA PROVIDED BY THE BUREAU HOUSEHOLD GOODS AND SERVICES. CLEARLY SHOWS THAT CONSUMER COMPLAINTS INVESTIGATION THE BUREAU ARE OVERWHELMINGLY FOCUSED. ON UNLICENSED ACTIVITY. WE THAT VIOLATION ACTIVE. WILL ONLY CAN TO GROW THIS BILL SUCCESS. AND CARRIERS OF HOUSEHOLD GOODS ARE ALLOWED TO SKIRT STATE LAW. REQUIREMENTS FINALLY. CURRENT PROJECT IS NOT COMPLICATED. EXCELLENT RESOURCE FOR COMPANIES SEEKING LICENSES AND THE LICENSE HELD BY THE COMPANY NOT BY INDIVIDUAL DRIVERS ARE EMPLOYEES BECAUSE FREIGHT COMPANIES OFFERING CUSTOMER SERVICES DO NOT BELIEVE THEY SHOULD BE LICENSED BY THE STATE IT'S NOT A JUSTIFIABLE REASON TO REMOVE THE STATE'S ABILITY. TO PROTECT CONSUMERS THANK YOU AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NOTEBOOK. THANK YOU SIR. LET'S BEGIN WITH- ANY OPPOSITION WITNESSES IN THE GALLERY. SEEING NONE. SECURITY DID THAT TODAY. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THE MODERATOR. IF THERE'S ANYONE WHO WISHES TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. MISTER CHAIR NO WONDER SIGNALED THAT THEY WISH TO SPEAK THANK YOU LET'S BRING THE ART MADE BY I STAND CORRECTED WE DO HAVE ONE PERSON I APOLOGIZE PARDON ME. PARDON ME MR CHERRY JUST ANOTHER MOMENT PLEASE. WE'RE GONNA GO TO LINE SEVENTY SIX. HI I'M STEPHEN FRAZIER RECENT RETIREE FROM CONTRA COSTA COUNTY TO THE COACHELLA VALLEY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAVING RECENTLY USED TWO OF THESE CONTAINER TYPE POT COMPANIES AS RECENTLY AS THREE WEEKS AGO AND I AM. HOLD STRONGLY IN OPPOSITION TO THIS THE FROG. THE OVER REACH BUT THESE COMPANIES- WAS. ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS THE. THE FACT THAT THEY COULD BE EVEN MORE UNREGULATED. SPEAKS TO THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES TO CONSUMERS LIKE ME IF ANYTHING THERE SHOULD BE MORE REGULATIONS I TOTALLY AM AN OPPOSITION SUPPORTER CALIFORNIA MOVING AND STORAGE POSITION I'VE READ THEIR OPPOSITION IN THE ASSEMBLY PAPERS AND I SUPPORT THEIR- POSITION IN OPPOSITION I HAVE NEVER CALLED TO THE STATE CAPITOL. EITHER FOR OR AGAINST THE BILL BUT HAVING BEEN HORROR. AS A CONSUMER CALIFORNIA CONSUMER BY THESE COMPANIES. I HAVE BEEN MOTIVATED FOR THE FIRST TIME TO CALL IN AND I HOPE MY STATE REPRESENTATIVE. IN THE LEGISLATURE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE YOU KNOW AND THE REST OF THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE MEMBERS HAVING HEARD NOT FROM A LOBBYIST NOT FROM AN ASSOCIATION BUT FROM A CONSUMER ME. HAVING EXPERIENCED THIS AND I HAVE IT ALL DOCUMENTED. AND PUT TOGETHER THAT IT CAN ALL BE REPRESENTED TOTALLY IN OPPOSITION I WISH. SURE THERE IS NO ONE ELSE TO SIGNAL BUT THEY WISH TO SPEAK. THANK YOU LET'S BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO MY COLLEAGUES HERE IN THE CHAMBER COLLEAGUES ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS ABOUT THIS MEASURE SENATOR EDMUND. THANK YOU- HI I HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THIS IS THAT. SO HOW MANY HOW MANY OF THESE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THAT WOULD THEN BE GRANTED THIS EXEMPTION DO WE KNOW HOW MANY COMPANIES BECAUSE I MEAN THIS IS A BUSINESS MODEL CORRECT- THAT MOVES GOODS RIGHT. SO I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND THEN HOW WE'RE SAYING THEY'RE NOT MOVERS JUST BECAUSE THEY DON'T DO THE ACTUAL PACKING BUT THEY DO THE- THE TRANSPORTATION SO I GUESS I GUESS I. MEAN HOW MANY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT IT AND IF WE'RE DOING AN EXEMPTION TO GET AROUND. OUR SYSTEM OF REGULATION- AND ARE. YOU GOING TO DO IT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL- IT JUST SEEMS LIKE IT IS THAT YOU CAN EASILY. CREATE A PROLIFERATION OF PEOPLE WHO JUST MAY NOT ADVERTISE AS OUR FULL SERVICE MOVERS BUT INDEED THEY ARE MOVING GOOD SO DO YOU KNOW ABOUT HOW MANY. COMPANIES OPERATE UNDER THIS TYPE OF BUSINESS MODEL WHICH IS. A DIFFERENT FROM DOING THE PACKING. WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE CHAIR. PLEASE SEE I WOULD- RESPECTFULLY REQUESTED MR SHIMODA. AND OR MR GUSMAN BUT. GERMAN EITHER ONE OF YOU WANT TO RESPOND IF YOU'RE STILL ON THE LINE. TO RESPOND TO A CENTER ADMINS QUESTION- THIS KRISHNA CALIFORNIA TRUCKING ASSOCIATION SO WE HAVE- WE WERE BRINGING THE MEASURE PREDOMINANTLY ON BEHALF OF THREE OF OUR MEDICARE MEMBERS IN WHAT'S CALLED THE LESS THAN TRUCKLOAD SECTOR TO USE A TRUCK IN TERM. THESE ARE VERY LARGE WELL CAPITALIZED CARRIERS WITH REGIONAL NETWORKS THAT ALLOW THEM TO PROVIDE THIS SERVICE- THEY'RE NOT MOVING COMPANIES IN THE TRADITIONAL SENSE IN THAT THEY OFFER MULTIPLE LINES OF SERVICE PREDOMINANTLY IN THE IN THE- TRADITIONAL FREIGHT TRUCKING SECTOR. SO AT LEAST THREE COMPANIES THAT ARE DOING THIS BUT WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY. AND WE ALSO DON'T KNOW. WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THEIR BUSINESS IS THIS SPECIFICALLY JUST JUST TO MOVE TO TRANSPORT GOODS DO WE KNOW THAT. OKAY JUST TO- FURTHER- CLARIFY I KNOW WE'VE WE'VE HAD SOME DISCUSSIONS- WITH COMMITTEE CONSULTATS ABOUT THE SCOPE. OF THE MEASURE. AND OR INTENTION- YOU KNOW THAT WE CAN SPEAK AT LEAST ON THE CO SPONSOR STANDPOINT- WAS NOT TO ADDRESS- COMPANIES WHO ARE LOOKING TO BE IN THE MOVIE BUSINESS FULL TIME BUT RATHER. OUR MEMBERSHIP WHO ARE PREDOMINATELY- FREIGHT TRUCKING COMPANIES ARE PROVIDING THIS AS AN ANCILLARY SERVICE TO. THEIR OVERALL BUSINESS SO THAT THAT IS A DISCUSSION THAT WE HAVE. I HAD HOPED TO HAVE ON ON GOING BASIS. OKAY I DON'T THINK I HAVE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS I JUST I DON'T FEEL LIKE THIS IS IT. IT FEELS IKE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO BE ABLE TO GROW UP TO BE GRAND TO GO A WHOLE BIG EXEMPTION IF WE DON'T KNOW. THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE NUMBER AND THEN WHAT WHAT IT DOES TO THE EXISTING REGULATED INDUSTRY THAT IS ALREADY ESTABLISHED THANK. COLLEAGUES ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER I WILL I'LL SAY THIS I- SEARCHABLE. THANK YOU MR AS A REAL ESTATE BROKER I HAVE HAD CLIENTS- OVER THE YEARS WHO VIEWS THIS TYPE OF SERVICE AND THEIR COMMENTS THAT I'VE HEARD ABOUT THE TEAMSTERS THE DRIVERS- THE PROFESSIONALISM IN DROPPING OFF THE CONTAINER PICKING HIM UP- IT'S BEEN FANTASTIC AND THEY'VE GONE- FROM ONE END TO THE COUNTY TO THE OTHER. IN SOME EVEN OUT OF STATE AND THE CONTAINERS WERE THERE AS AGREED AND SO I SEE THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT ENTRY LEVEL OF BUYER AND ALSO PEOPLE- WHO JUST CAN'T AFFORD THE NORMAL PROCESS OF HIRING A LARGE- COMPANY TO PACK THEM UP. AND AS WE KNOW IN TODAY'S ECONOMY A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE MOVING FROM POINT A TO POINT B. AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS WILL ALL PARTICIPATE AND HELP HIM PACK UP IN THEY COULD FILL UP THE CONTAINERS AND OF COURSE THE TEAMSTER DRIVERS- WITH THEIR EXPERIENCE AND PROFESSIONALISM. PICK IT UP AND MOVING ON SO- I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL AND I'LL MOVE IT AT THE PROPER TIME. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR EXCELLENT I WAS ABOUT TO SAY- SOME OF YOU KNOW I SORT OF BELIEVE THAT THE REASON WE REGULATE. ONE PARTICULAR SECTION OF THE INDUSTRY OR OCCUPATION THIS PARTICULAR CASES. WE REGULATE THOSE WHO MOVE THE HOUSEHOLD GOODS OF RESIDENTS OF THE STATE. AND THE PURPOSE I ASSUME IS TO ENSURE THAT THOSE HOUSEHOLD GOODS ARE SAFEGUARDED. BUT DURING THE PROCESS FROM WITHOUT REGARD TO WHO ACTUALLY PACKS THE BOXES WHO ACTUALLY TAKES THE BOXES. AND PUTS THEM IN THIS CASE IN THE PODS. SO I BELIEVE I SHARE THE CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY SENATOR EGGMAN. ABOUT THIS MEASURE- AND I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH MY CUT COME IN THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE SENATOR ARCHER LETTER WITH RESPECT TO THE PROFESSIONALISM OF. THE TEAMSTERS AND OTHERS WHO WERE INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS. BUT I SUPPOSE THE SAME COMMENTS COULD BE MADE WITH RESPECT TO THE OTHER ASPECTS OF THE HOUSEHOLD GOODS MOVING INDUSTRY AND THEN THE QUESTION IS WHY REGULATE. A SECTION OF IT AND THEN. ON NOT ANOTHER PART OF THE OPERATION. I AM GOING TO- DEFER TO THE WISHES F MY COLLEAGUES ON THE COMMITTEE WITH RESPECT TO THE MOTION AND THE VOTE- BUT I DO HAVE THOSE CONCERNS AND I THINK IF WE MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD IF THIS BILL MOVES OUT OF THE COMMITTEE WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS. AS TO WHAT DIFFERENTIATES. THIS ASPECT OF THE POT OPERATION AS OPPOSED TO WHEN YOU JUST HAVE ONE DROP IN YOUR DRIVEWAY AND YOU USE IT TO TEMPORARILY STORE YOUR- HOUSEHOLD GOODS WHILE YOU'RE REMODELING YOUR HOUSE. AND THE ASPECT OF THE POT INDUSTRY THAT REALLY CLOSELY RESEMBLES THE REST OF THE MOVING AND TRANSPORT INDUSTRY IN THIS STATE SO. COLLEGE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS CENTRE ARCHULETA HAS MOVED. SUBMIT MEMBER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE- IN REGARDING THE POD IN THE COURSE THERE'S A COMPANY CALLED POD- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT TYPE OF BUSINESS IS NOT DEALT WITH. IN THIS BILL- OTHER TYPES BUT NOT SPECIFICALLY POD BUSINESS MODEL- AGAIN I'LL DEFER TO THE- CO SPONSORS TO CLEAR. OR CORRECT THAT BUT THAT'S WHAT MY UNDERSTANDING IS- HAVING SAID THAT I WILL RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT AND PLEDGED TO WORK TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL OF YOU- TO IMPROVE THE BILL IF IT NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED- WE'VE HAD GOOD CONVERSATIONS WITH YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF- AND OFFERED AN AMENDMENT BUT THERE'S BEEN NO- MEETING OF THE MINDS YET.

THANK YOU MR- I'D LIKE TO CONGRATULATE THE AUTHOR FOR COMING FORTH AND OF COURSE THE COMMUNITY OF CONTENT FOR COMING TOGETHER- AND TAKING PRIDE IN THEIR COMMUNITY THE STAND UP. FOR SOMETHING THAT OBVIOUSLY HAS BEEN THERE FOR YEARS AND YEARS MY QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR IS. ISN'T THERE A PROPRIETOR ISN'TTHERE OWNERSHIP OF THAT CEMETERY THAT- THEY SHOULD HAVE MAINTAINED THIS ALONG THE WAY AND HOW HOW HAS IT ALL FALLING APART. NOW THAT- WITH THIS BILL OBVIOUSLY ISN'T IN DIRE NEED OF CORRECTING THIS BUT HOW HOW DID THIS HAPPEN AND HOW DO WE PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING ACROSS THE STATE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR- WE HAVE A LAW AND THIS BILL SEEKS TO CLOSE THE LOOPHOLE IN THE LAW- CEMETERY CARETAKER OWNER CAN SURRENDER HIS OR HER LICENSE AND WALK AWAY. AND THIS BILL SIX FIFTY ONE PREVENTS THAT FROM HAPPENING IT CREATES NO ACCOUNTABILITY BUT ALSO TRANSPARENCY BECAUSE WHEN WE LAY OUR LOVED ONES TO REST AT- THEIR FINAL RESTING LOCATION WE EXPECT THOSE LOVED ONES TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. IN A CEMETERY YOU CAN GO VISIT THAT IS THAT IS- IT'S A QUIET PLACE BUT IT'S A BEAUTIFUL PLACE AND WOODLAWN CEMETERY DOESN'T REPRESENT THAT IN THE PREVIOUS CARETAKER. COULD NOT AFFORD- THE UPKEEP AND SURRENDER AND WALKED AWAY AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CLOSE THIS LOOPHOLE- AS THE CEMETERY HAS THE CEMETERY THROUGH THEIR RESEARCH AT THE SEVEN DAY- CALIFORNIA CEMETERY AND FUNERAL. BUREAU PUBLISHED THE REPORT I'M SHOWING THAT THERE'S OVER A HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN PRIVATELY OWNED CEMETERIES THAT ARE ON THE BRINK OF INSOLVENCY SO THIS BILL. WILL CLOSE THAT LOOPHOLE TO MAKING SURE THE AT ONE THIS NEVER AGAIN. AND TO PROVIDE A NEST SUPPORT AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT. IN WHICH THAT THE CEMETERIES CAN ABSOLUTELY GET THE HELP THAT THEY NEED- AND THEY NEED IT RIGHT NOW SO THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS SO IMPORTANT AND THIS BILL SEEKS TO CORRECT THIS FROM HAPPENING. IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER TIME THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS CENTERING THANK YOU BUT- IF YOU DO AND IS THERE A MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE IS THEIR WANT TO CEMETERIES IN PLACE AND THERE'S NO DAMAGE DO WE KNOW THE HEALTH OF ALL THE INDICTMENTS ACROSS THE STATE AT THIS TIME AND IF YOU'RE GONNA MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS FOR MORE TO GO IN THERE. BUT I I'M A I'M A FAN OF CEMETERIES IN HISTORY AND VISIT THEM VISIT THEM WHEREVER I GO AND THIS- YOU KNOW UP IN THE MOUNTAINS THAT ARE ARE- ARE NOT IN GREAT REPAIR- BUT I BUT I WONDER YOU KNOW WHO'S RESPONSIBLE THEN AND IF THERE IS NO EXISTING AND DAMAGES THE COUNTY THEN JUST. PICK UP THE COST FOR MAINTAINING THAT SURE I WANT TO DEFER TO MISTER GERRY DESMOND TO ADDRESS- WHAT PART OF YOUR QUESTION. THIS DOESN'T. IN THE GALLERY. THREE GERRY DOESN'T END WITH THE C. MAX THE CEMETERY ASSOCIATION FIRST IN TERMS OF THE OVERSIGHT OF THE ENDOWMENT CARE FINDS THE SPOT PRIVATE CEMETERIES THAT ARE REGULATED OF COURSE- RELIGIOUS CEMETERIES MUNICIPAL CEMETERIES ARE NOT REGULATED BUT IN TERMS OF THE ALMOST TWO HUNDRED REGULATED CEMETERIES WE REPORT% ANNUALLY TO THE BUREAU ON OR INTEL MAKE YOUR FUNDS AND THERE IS OVERSIGHT OF THE GIRL ON THE FUNDS. YOU KNOW SECONDARILY AS DISCUSSED IN THE ANALYSIS THERE ARE MAINTENANCE STANDARDS REQUIRED BY STATUTE THAT ADOPTED BY REGULATION THAT ARE ALSO OF THE DUE TO INSPECTION THERE'S I KNOW INSPECTIONS BY THE BUREAU OF EACH OF THE PROPERTIES THE WAY THAT THIS WOULD BE PREVENTED IN THE FUTURE WE BELIEVE IS A- ADDRESS BY EIGHTY SIX FIFTY ONE AND ONE WAY WICH IS. THE OVER THE OVER A HUNDRED PROPERTIES ARE REFERRED TO BY A SEVEN MEMBER GIBSON WE KNOW THAT THERE HAS BEEN A LONG TIME WAITING FOR THE ODOMETER FUN MINIMUM DEPOSITS TO BE INCREASED WE ESTIMATE THAT WITH THE MEASURE THE L. DEPOSITS WILL BE INCREASED ALMOST DOUBLE WHAT THE NEW KIND OF MECHANISM IN THE NEW STANDARDS WILL BE IN PLACE AND THEN SECONDARILY THE BUREAU IS ADOPTING REGULATIONS THAT WILL PROVIDE FOR THE BETTER INVESTMENT. OF THOSE FUNDS TO ENABLE THEM TO BE- TO BE MORE SUCCESSFUL IN THE FUTURE PROVIDE FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF AN OPENING OF THE CEMETERIES. YOU KNOW AFTER THEY RUN OUT OF SPACE IS. TELL ME OR OR THE OF THE CEMETERIES HAS THEIR OWN SEPARATE ENDOWMENT YES THE- THE CENTER ADMIN JERRY DOESN'T AGAIN P. EACH CEMETERY- REGULATED CEMETERY AGAIN. IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN AN ODOMETER FUN FOR ALL OF THE SEVEN ONE FUN FOR THE ENTIRE CEMETERY. OKAY AND THEN AND THEN JUST FINALLY WE'RE GOING TO INCREASE THE COST BUT WHO PAYS AT THE- SENATOR THE SO TO POTENTIALLY THE COST TO BURY SOMEBODY COULD GO UP IF THE AMOUNT OF. THE COST. THE PRICE OF THAT REAL ESTATE PROPERTY GOES UP IS THAT CORRECT HE PUT UP A POTENTIALLY OF LIKE MANY OTHER INDUSTRIES IT'S QUITE COMPETITIVE AND IT'S A BUSINESS DECISION OF EACH CEMETERY BUT KNOWING THAT IN SOME CASES IN COMPETITIVE AREAS THE COST MAY BE. UPDATE JUST THE PRICE MAY BE ADJUSTED UPWARD THAT'S WHY THE LEGISLATION THANKS TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER GIPSON WILL INCREASE OVER THREE YEARS SO THAT IT'S NOT A SHOCK IN THOSE CASES WHERE IT WILL BE THE CONSUMER THE PACE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SEEING NO OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS NO MIKE'S UP.

ADDITIONALLY THIS INFORMATION IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE BETWEEN RESTAURANTS THE PANDEMIC HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT ENOUGH ON THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY AND WE CANNOT RISK IMPLEMENTING THIS BILL AFTER THE TUMULTUOUS YEAR RESTAURANTS HAVE. A BETTER SOLUTION WOULD BE TO REQUIRE PLATFORMS TO DISCLOSE TO CUSTOMERS THAT RESTAURANTS LIKE CHILI'S AND MAGGIANO'S DO IN FACT PAY A COMMISSION AS PART OF THE TRANSACTION. WITHOUT REQUIRING THE DISCLOSURE OF THE ACTUAL WORK. THAT BEING SAID I APPRECIATE THE REASON THAN THAT- ADDITION OF AMENDMENTS ALLOWING US TO.

THE TEACHER THERE IS NO ONE ELSE TO SIGNAL THEY WISH TO SPEAK THANK YOU LET'S BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO MY COLLEAGUES IN THE SENATE CHAMBER COLLEAGUES ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS SENATOR MAN FOLLOWED BY. SENATOR EDMUND. THANK YOU MR CHAIR- SO I DID HAVE A QUESTION I GENERALLY THINK THE TRANSPARENCY BILLS OF THIS KIND ARE ARE GOOD AND- YOU KNOW SUPPORT THE GOALS OF THIS BILL- I DID WONDER WHETHER THE AMENDMENTS ADDRESSING THE CONCERNS OF THE GROCERS I. YOU KNOW HEARD FROM THE GROCERS EARLIER THIS WEEK ABOUT SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS AROUND. THE PRICING BUT- AS I AS I READ THE AMENDMENTS TODAY THEY SEEM TO. ADDRESS ANY CONCERNS AROUND GROCERS HAVING SALES AND THOSE PRICES. BEING REFLECTED OR NOT REFLECTED IN THE FOOD DELIVERY PLATFORM WEBSITE SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS BOOKED TO. MISTER BROWN AND ALSO TO THE AUTHOR TO JUST UNDERSTAND BETTER HI WHETHER THESE AMENDMENTS- DO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS OR NOT AND ALSO WHETHER- THE AUTHOR BELIEVES THEY DO AND IF THEY DON'T IF SHE'S WILLING TO CONSIDER FUTURE AMENDMENTS TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS. OUT LAID OUT BY THE GROCERS. I WILL SAY I THINK- I THINK THE CHAIR REALLY PROVIDE ME WITH A VERY CLEAR AMENDMENT SO THAT IT'S CLEAR THAT IT IS THE FOOD FACILITY SETTING WHATEVER FEET WHATEVER COST. WHATEVER SPECIAL THAT THEY WON IT'S JUST CAN'T BE MANIPULATED OR CHANGED BY THE APP. IF IF GROCERS AREN'T HAPPY WITH WITH- WHAT I THOUGHT WAS VERY GRACEFUL SOLUTION WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO. CLARIFY I DON'T KNOW I THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR DEFINITELY CLEAR THAT WE HAD IT BEFORESO I'M HOPEFUL THAT- IF THERE'S STILL WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE OUR OUR- OUR GOAL. IS UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE A LOT OF CASES THAT CAME TO US WHERE WHERE THE APPLE IS. CHARGING THE MENU OR SALE PRICE AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO TRY TO AVOID- AND BEFORE- I TURNED TO. A MISTER BROWN FROM THE CHAIRS STANDPOINT SINCE WE WERE VERY ACTIVELY INVOLVED. WITH THE GRACIOUS CONSENT OF THE AUTHOR I WILL NOTE. THE INTENT IS. TO MAKE THE UNLAWFUL LAWFUL DECISION POINT. WHAT IS POSTED BY THE FOOD FACILITY. ON THE MENU WHEN THE FOOD PLATFORMS. BRO CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LOUIS BROWN ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA GROCERS ASSOCIATION A WE'RE STILL REVIEWING THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS AS WE JUST SAW THEM LATE LAST EVENING TO SEE HOW THEY WOULD IMPACT US BUT WE STILL DON'T SEE THAT THE SCOPE OF THE BILL NATURALLY FITS GROCERS THIS IS A BILL DEALING WITH FOOD DELIVERY OF FOOD AND BEVERAGES AND IS FOCUSED ON THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY OUR AGREEMENTS WITH OUR THIRD PARTY FOOD DELIVERY PROVIDERS- ARE MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE- WE ALREADY DISCLOSED WHEN PRICES MAY BE DIFFERENT ON THE APP. AND FRANKLY JUST DON'T SEE HOW THE INTENT OF THE BILL FIX OUR BUSINESS MODEL SO AGAIN WE WILL REVIEW THE AMENDMENTS BUT AT THIS POINT WE JUST DON'T SEE HOW THIS BILL FIX OUR BUSINESS MODEL OUR AGREEMENTS AND THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE WRITTEN OUT OF THIS SPECIFIC SECTION. THE MANAGER BY SENTIMENT I'LL JUST SAY THAT GIVEN THE AUTHOR'S WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT THESE AMENDMENTS- THE WAY THAT I READ THE AMENDMENTS IN THE BILL- I WILL SUPPORT THIS BILL TO MOVE IT OUT OF COMMITTEE BECAUSE- IT DOESN'T CLEAR THE AUTHORS- TRYING TO MOVE THIS IN A WAY THAT ADDRESSES THE GROCERS CONCERNS. THANK YOU THANK YOU AND I WOULD MOVE TO BUILD A PROPER TIME THANK YOU SIR- CENTER ADMIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR- THANKS TO THE AUTHOR. OF THIS IS THAT. I GUESS I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. WHO THIS HELPS. THIS IS BUSINESS PROFESSIONS AND CONSUMER PROTECTION SO ARE WE ARE WE TRYING TO. INITIALLY APPELLEE PROTECTING THE BUSINESS ARE WE PROTECTING THE CONSUMER I GUESS IS MY QUESTION BECAUSE- LIKE LIKE SO AS A AS A CONSUMER I KNOW THAT IT IS BETTER FOR THE RESTAURANT IF I'M AN ORDER FOOD THAT I GO THERE AND EAT. IF NOT I CAN GO THERE AND PICK IT UP. THERE ARE SOMETIMES THOUGH WHEN I DON'T. WHEN I'M FEELING A LITTLE LAZY I DON'T WANT TO GO OUT AND THEN I KNOW I'M GOING TO FEEL A BIT MORE AND BUT IT IS A BUSINESS MODEL. SO AND I DON'T KNOW THAT I NEED TO KNOW. ALL OF THAT BECAUSE WHEN I WHEN I DO IT ON MY APP AND HAVE THEM GO LOOKING AT OUR APP ONLY WHEN WE USE THESE AND YOU CAN SEE WHAT IT'S GOING TO COST YOU SEE THE TOTALLY SEE EVERYTHING. WHY DO I NEED SOMETHING ELSE AT THE END T TELL ME. WHAT I THINK WHAT I ALREADY KNOW AND I GUESS AND I GUESS. WHO WHO CARES WHO WHO'S BEEN PROTECTED BY THIS. ACT AND IT'S A GREAT QUESTION. I ACTUALLY THINK EVERYBODY'S BEING PROTECTED BY THIS AND THAT WAS A SET AT THE BILL CAME TO US THROUGH RESTAURANTS FIRST WHICH IS INTERESTING- BECAUSE OF. OF A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY- WITH THE APPS. WHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD GOOD EXPERIENCES IN YOU MIGHT. WHAT CAME UP ON YOUR- ON YOUR PHONE MAY HAVE BEEN WHAT YOU WERE ACTUALLY CHARGE THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME AND SAID. WAIT I ORDERED THIS AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN I HAD ADDITIONAL FEES CHARGED. AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE THIS CAME FROM I DON'T KNOW THAT WHY THERE'S A DISPARITY- I DON'T KNOW WHY. SO WE CAN GO THROUGH ALL IT'S ALL ABOUT TRANSPARENCY IT'S LETTING CONSUMERS KNOW. WHAT THEY'RE BEING CHARGED AND WHY THEY'RE BEING CHARGED THAT. TO LET CONSUMERS KNOW THAT THE PRICE THEY'RE PAYING FOR A MENU ITEM. IS SET BY THE RESTAURANT AT THE OP DIDN'T. PAD ONTO THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE WE'VE- WE'VE FOUND ALL OF THESE CASES RIGHT. THEY THAT THEY KNOW- IT'S- FOR THE RESTAURANT- AND TERE ARE A LOT OF RESTAURANTS COMING OUT. COBIT WHO ARE LIKE. HEY I YES WE HAVE TO RELY ON THIS TO KEEP OUR DOORS OPEN BUT- PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW HOW MUCH. OR IT'S NOW THE RESTAURANT'S CHOICE WHETHER THEY WANT TO DISCLOSE THE AMOUNT BUT THAT THEY- ARE. ALSO PAYING A FEE A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T. REALIZE I THINK. HI WHAT IS GOING ON HERE. AND IT'S ALSO THE TIPS AND GRATUITIES TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE DRIVER- YOU KNOW. GETS THOSE ACTUAL TIPS AND GRATUITIES AND THAT THE RESTAURANT IF IT'S A DELIVERY ORDER. ARE YOU AT THE PICKUP ORDER THAT THE RESTAURANT. GETS IT IN NOT THE APP COMPANY. SO WE'RE JUST TRYING TO. ENSURE THAT. WHAT YOU WOULD THINK NORMALLY. IS HAPPENING BECAUSE THERE ARE NO RULES RIGHT NOW AROUND IT. AND THAT YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE PAYING FOR. THAT IT'S CLEAR IT'S UP FRONT AND YOU HAVE THAT INFORMATION. RIGHT BUT DID YOU SEEMS TO BE AN AN INHERENT ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE CHARGED LIKE BECAUSE SOMEBODY'S GONNA PAY RIGHT SOME IS GOING TO PAY THAT FOR TO GO PICK IT UP AND INSURE I MEAN SURE RIGHT. SO I ASSUME THAT I'M GOING TO BE CHARGED WHEN I WHEN I HAVE SOMEBODY BRING MY FOOD TO MY DOOR. ABSOLUTELY AND I ACTUALLY THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT- BECAUSE THERE ARE ALL THESE YOU KNOW THEY THEY THEY COME UP WITH THE SALES LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO GET THIS WE HAVE FREE DELIVERY DELIVERY IS NOT FREE IT IS IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT IF SOMEBODY'S JOB THAT IS AT YOU KNOW. WHAT HAPPENS SO WHEN IT'S FREE FOR US AS A CONSUMER IT'S BEING CHARGED TO THE RESTAURANT AND MAYBE WE THINK THAT'S OBVIOUS RIGHT BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE THINKING THROUGH ALL OF THESE AND WHAT WE WANT IS PEOPLE TO HAVE THAT INFORMATION. MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION I FULLY ANTICIPATE THAT THIS WILL CONTINUE THIS IS- THIS KIND OF TRANSPARENCY IS IN PLACE IN DIFFERENT CITIES THIS IS JUST ALLOWING EVERYBODY TO KNOW THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON YES DELIVERIES COST THAT'S OKAY THAT'S- THE CONVENIENCE AND HOPEFULLY PEOPLE REALIZE. IF I GET MY LITTLE CODE AND I GET FREE DELIVERY SOMEBODY IS STILL PAYING THAT DELIVERY IT'S NOT YOU KNOW AND WHO IS PAYING INTEREST SO THAT THEY HAVE THAT INFORMATION. OKAY SO. SO BASICALLY THE BILL IS TO LET PEOPLE KNOW. THAT THEY ARE PAYING FOR DELIVERY. WELL WHAT SOME PEOPLE DIDN'T REALIZE THEY THINK THEY'RE PAYING FOR DELIVERY THEY DON'T REALIZE THE RESTAURANT IS ALSO PAYING A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT FOR THE DELIVERY THEY SHOULD KNOW THAT- THEY SHOULD KNOW. BASICALLY THAT WHAT I JUST ORDERED WAS ACTUALLY WHAT THE RESTAURANT IS CHARGING SO THEY COULD CHARGE MORE FOR A MENU ITEM THAT IS OUT ON DELIVERY BECAUSE THEY'RE PAYING MORE BUT THE RESTAURANT SETTING THAT. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW SOME OF THE APPS HAVE A CHARGE ON ON ACTUAL ITEMS THEY KNOW THAT THE EVERYBODY WILL KNOW NOW THIS THIS IS A GRATUITY IT GOES TO MY DRIVER OR THE PERSON SERVICING ME. IN ADDITION TO WHATEVER ELSE THEIR PAIN AT THIS DOESN'T FULFILL THE OBLIGATION OF THEM BEING PAID WE JUST THINK YOU KNOW THIS IS BEEN A VERY- HIT IN PROCESS AND UNFORTUNATELY THESE COMPANIES HAVE BEEN CAUGHT EVERY STEP OF THE WAY TRYING TO. GET MORE MONEY FOR THEM WHICH I GOT BUT LIKE TRYING TO PULL A FAST ONE WHETHER IT'S ON THE DRIVERS FOR THE RESTAURANTS FOR THE CONSUMERS AND WE JUST THINK THAT THE TRANSPARENCY WILL ALLOW PEOPLE TO FEEL COMFORTABLE USING IT WILL KNOW. WHAT IS HAPPENING. THANK LET ME JUST NOTE IN CASE IT HELPS SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WAS GRACIOUS ENOUGH TO ACCEPT TO ACCEPT AN AMENDMENT AS TO THE DISCLOSURES. WHERE THE DISCLOSURE TO THE CONSUMER SIMPLY STATES THAT THERE WILL BE THERE THERE IS A CHARGE TO THE FOOD FACILITY FOR THIS PARTICULAR SERVICE. AND ONLY IF THE FOOD FACILITY DIRECTS THAT MORE DETAIL BE PROVIDED BY THE FOOD DELIVERY PLATFORM IS MORE DETAILS. REGARDING THE ARRANGEMENT BETWEEN THE FOOD FACILITY AND THE DELIVERY PLATFORM. PROVIDED SO ONLY IF THE FOOD FACILITY. DIRECTS THAT THE DIGITAL INFORMATION BE PROVIDED WILL BE PROVIDED BY THE AS A DISCLOSURE BY THE DELIVERY PLATFORM. CENTRE BACK FOR. EXAGGERATE CLEAR FILES FOR MY COLLEAGUE OF MINE IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE WERE CASES WHERE PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY WERE PAYING TIPS THAT WE'RE GOING TO THE DRIVERS AND ACTUALLY WAS GOING TO THE COMPANY ITSELF RIGHT NOW YEAH THAT'S ONE THING THAT WILL BE THAT PREVENTED BY THIS BILL A. N. AND ALSO AT THAT BELIEVES THE BILL WILL CAN IMPROVE ECOSYSTEM ESSENTIALLY WHERE THE RESTAURANTS WERE- AT THE POINT WHERE THE SERVICE WAS NOT PROFITABLE ESSENTIALLY FOR THEM AND SO. THE HOPE IS THAT TRANSPARENCY WILL ALSO MAKE THE ECO SYSTEM WORK FOR EVERYONE. YEAH ESPECIALLY THE MOM AND POP RESTAURANTS I MEAN I. GOT YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO RESTAURANTS ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY'RE FACING- OBVIOUSLY IF YOU'RE A BIG CHAIN LKE MCDONALD'S YOU CAN YOU KNOW THAT FIRST OF ALL THEY HAVE A BETTER YEAH. THEY HAVE A BETTER FEE SCHEDULE BUT THEY CAN ALSO NEGOTIATE THIS THEMSELVES THEY CAN TAKE CARE OF IT BUT WHEN YOU'RE A MOM AND POP THAT. HAD TO RELY ON DELIVERY SERVICES AND NOW JUST WANT YOUR CUSTOMERS TO UNDERSTAND. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH THE OTHER THING IS ALSO ON A PICK UP ORDER IF YOU CALL YOU CAN CALL THROUGH GRUBHUB FOR EXAMPLE IN ACTUALLY GO PICK UP YOUR ORDER YOURSELF. I THINK MOST PEOPLE ASSUME IF I WRITE A TIP IT'S TO THE RESTAURANT WELL THAT'S NOT THE LAW RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW THAT YOU WRITE A TIP IN THE APP COMPANY TO TAKE IT SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT THAT. BELONGS TO WHO YOU THINK YOU'RE GIVING IT TO AND EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS BILL IS NOT TO PUNISH ANYONE IT IS TO PROVIDE CONSUMERS.

THANK YOU CHAIR AND SENATORS I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE CHAIR FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT ON THIS BILL AND I ALSO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TODAY WHICH ACTUALLY MAKE OUR- CONSUMER DISCLOSURE PROTECTIONS ACTUALLY STRONGER SO I APPRECIATE THAT. THIS BILL ASSEMBLY BILL FOURTEEN FORTY FOUR TAKES A THREE PRONGED APPROACH PROTECT CONSUMERS AND HELP SMALL BUSINESSES EIGHT ONE ENSURES THAT FOOD OVER PLATFORMS IN ONLINE DIRECTORIES PROVIDE ACCURATE BUSINESS INFORMATION SECOND IT PROHIBITS THIRD PARTY PLATFORMS AND CHARGING RESTAURANTS FOR ROUTED CALLS THAT DO NOT RESULT IN A PAID ORDER. AND THIRDLY AND LASTLY FOR CARS ALL FUTURE CONTRACTS BENEFIT FOOD FACILITY AND A FOOD DELIVERY PLATFORM INCLUDE CLEAR INFORMATION ON ALL POSSIBLE CHARGES OR FEES THAT MAY BE INCURRED ON TO THE RESTAURANT RIGHT CLICK INFORMATION LISTING WEBSITE WEBSITES WE PARTNER WITH THE FOOD DELIVERY PLATFORM. HOWEVER AS I KNOW WE JUST HAD A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE ONLINE ECOSYSTEM FOR SMALL RESTAURANTS AND I JUST WANNA POINT OUT WHY THIS BILL IS NECESSARY FOR THE CONSUMER AND THE RESTAURANT FROM THE CONSUMER PERSPECTIVE IF YOU WERE TO GO ON A LISTING WEB SITES A YELP OR GOOGLE. YOU WOULD HOPEFULLY BE CALLING A NUMBER WITHOUT AND WITHOUT INCURRING MORE COSTS ONTO THE RESTAURANT YOUR FAVORITE RESTAURANT BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE OF THE PRACTICE THAT WE ARE TRYING TO LEGISLATE. IN EARLIER THIS YEAR YEP ITSELF WHICH HAS A NEUTRAL POSITION AS BILL ACTUALLY ENDED THE PRACTICE OF CALL FORWARDING BECAUSE THEY DID NOT WANT TO BE SO SHE WITH THIS ANYMORE AND I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT WHY THE DISCLOSURES ARE SO IMPORTANT TO. IS THAT- THIS IS AN EXAMPLE THIS ONE PAGES TWO SIDED DOCUMENT IS EXAMPLE OF A CONTRACT AT A RESTAURANT ENTERS AND IT EVEN AS ON WORKS IN MUCH THE POLICY IS VERY CONFUSING AND- DOES NOT TALK ABOUT THE PROJECT ACTS OF CALL FORWARDING. AND IN A STREET THAT HAS RAZOR THIN MARGINS AND HAS REALLY SUFFERED DURING THE PANDEMIC ESPECIALLY OUR API BUSINESSES WHICH- HAVE REALLY SUFFERED DURING THIS PANDEMIC IT'S REALLY REALLY DIFFICULT. THIS IS WHY IT'S NECESSARY TO PROTECTION FOR THE SMALL BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS- AND THIS IS WHY WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE SOUL CAN. CHAMBER COALITION MADE ABOUT EIGHT.

AND CAMERON CAMERON DIMITRI IF I PRONOUNCE THAT CORRECTLY. YEAH HERE A SECOND HERE PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD MORNING SURE ROCKS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KENNETH SMITH AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF CRAB I FIRST LIKE TO THANK THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK ON FOURTEEN FORTY FOUR AND REMOVING ONEROUS REQUIREMENT FROM THIRD PARTY LISTING WEBSITE. THE BILL WOULD NEED SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS AND WE HAVE HEARD FROM MEMBERS AND WE HEARD FROM MEMBERS ON JULY SIXTH THAT THEY'RE STILL IMPROVEMENTS TO BE MADE WE REMAIN SUPPORTIVE OF THE PROVISION PROHIBITING THIRD PARTY PLATFORMS FOR CHARGING RESTAURANTS FOR RECALL DO NOT RESULT IN ORDERS. HOWEVER GRAHAM HAD STRONGLY OPPOSES THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT REQUIRING THE DISCLOSURE OF PHONE NUMBERS ON THIRD PARTY WITHIN MY- CERTAINLY BELIEVES IN A FUTURE WHERE THERE IS A VIBRANT AND GROWING RESTAURANT COMMUNITY AND THERE IS A BALANCE THAT IN PERSON IN THE LIBRARY OPTIONS FOR THEIR TEACHERS YOU'RE PART OF THAT COMMUNITY WORKING WITH AND ALONGSIDE A RESTAURANT SUPPORT THEIR BROWS. SHE GOT A CONTRACT WITH RUSSIA TO CALL CALIFORNIA IN THE COUNTRY TO PROVIDE. PHONE ORDERING SERVICE. RAPID BILL REQUIRES PROPER INSULIN TWO PHONE NUMBERS FOR THE REST. UNIQUE PHONE. FOR THE THIRD CONTE. TO PROVIDE. THE RESTAURANT DIRECTION AND- E.ON BEING CONFUSING FOR CONSUMERS. I'M FRIGHTENED REQUIRE WOULD HURT ABILITY FOR RESTAURANTS TO RUN THEIR BUSINESS IN THE STATE HE SAID. WE PROVIDE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH RESTAURANTS AND THEY'RE ABLE TO SEE THEIR ORDERS- AND WHO GENERATED BY IMPLANT CUSTOM PHONE ORDER A CUSTOM PHONE NUMBERS AND ABLE WE ALL TIME MARKETING. AND ALLOW FOR A RESTAURANT TO HAVE A BETTER IDEA WHICH MARKETING TOOLS WORK BY GENERATING THEIR ORDERS AND WHICH ONES DO NOT. THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF THE BILL GO BEYOND THE ORDER GENERATION RESTAURANT CONTRACTOR THAT TO PROVIDE SERVICES FOR A REASON PRETTY QUICKLY AND ESPECIALLY RIGHT NOW WE HEAR HOW THE SERVICE PARTICULARLY CRITICAL BECAUSE OF THE UNPRECEDENTED SHORTAGE OF HOSPITALITY STAFFERS. THE SERVICE IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT NEED TO OVERCOMING LANGUAGE BARRIERS FOR RESTAURANT OWNERS AROSS CALIFORNIA MAKE NO MISTAKE IF THIS LEGISLATION WERE TO PASS IT WOULD DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT MANY SMALL AN IMMIGRANT OWNED RESTAURANT. WE'VE BEEN ENGAGING WITH THE SPONSOR FOR SOMETIME AND RECOGNIZE THAT THE CELL NEED MEANINGFUL PROGRESS. WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING CONVERSATION. THANK YOU. MR DIMITRI IF YOU'RE ON THE LINE. YEAH GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS WHEN IT CAME. CIOS AND SENIOR EXECUTIVES THAT PROMOTES THE GROWTH OF INNOVATION ECONOMY AND REPRESENTS OVER EIGHTY COMPANIES AND FOUR MILLION EMPLOYEES. WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB FOURTEEN FORTY FOUR AS WE FIND IT IS PROBLEMATIC FOR SEVERAL REASONS. AS REPORTED BY A. B. TWENTY ONE FORTY NINE DOLLARS FROM LAST YEAR. WE DELIVERY COMPANIES HAVE CONTRACTS WITH ALL OF OUR RESTAURANT PARTNERS PRIOR TO LISTING THEM ON OUR SERVICE. REQUIREMENTS OF A. B. FOURTEEN FORTY FOUR THAT PRESCRIBE THE EXACT TAPING CONTENT OF ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES THE COMPANY NEED TO MAKE WHAT THEY NEED CONTRACTS. TOO FAR INTO A REALLY PRESCRIPTIVE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ONLY SERVE TO MAKE THE PROCESS OF JOINING OUR PLATFORMS MORE. DRAWN OUT AND BURN THEM FOR RESTAURANTS. NEED TO BE COVERED BY BRICK RANGE OF SERVICES AVAILABLE TO RESTAURANTS YOUR MEMBERS PLATFORMS THEY'RE NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH. RATHER TAILORED TO EACH FRENCH. RESTAURANTS EDITED COLLABORATE ON MARKETING COLLATERAL DETERMINED THE APPROPRIATE. NEIGHBORHOODS TO OPEN NEW LOCATIONS AND EVEN SEE HOW PRICING AFFECTS CONSUMER DEMAND ENTERTAINMENT RESTAURANT. STAFFING IT HAS STORED ABOUT THIS COULD ULTIMATELY COST OUR PARTNERS BIBLE ORDERS AND REVENUE. FOR THESE REASONS WE. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOU KNOW ABOUT THANK YOU. MODERATOR ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES WAITING TO TESTIFY ON THE LINE. MISTER CHAIR I DO NOT BELIEVE THERE ARE. THANK YOU LET'S BRING THE CONVERSATION BACK TO MY COLLEAGUES IN THE SENATE CHAMBER COLLEAGUES ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS CENTER NEWMAN. THANK YOU MR ASSEMBLYMAN LEADS. WANT TO COMMEND YOU FOR THIS BILL- I USED TO WORK FOR A LONG TIME IN THE INTERNET- AND- YOU KNOW FOLLOW THE PROGRESSION THE GROWTH OF SEARCH RELATED COMPANIES LIKE GOOGLE. AND HAVE BEEN CONTINUE PRESS OVER THE YEARS AT. THE POWER OF THE INTERNET PROVIDE SEARCH CAPABILITIES BUT BUT THE SKILL IN WHICH COMPANIES- MEDICATION THAT FIND NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO EXTRACT. REVENUES FROM SEARCH THIS IS A GOOD EXAMPLE- AND SO WHAT YOU'RE RESPONDING TO DO HERE BY WAY OF PROVIDING TRANSPARENCY AND DISCLOSURE- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY FOR. SOME OF THE RESTAURANT CATEGORIES THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED- GROUP THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS IS A CHALLENGING BUSINESS- EIGHTY EIGHT SMALL MOM AND POP RESTAURANT IS. UNDER A TON OF PRESSURE EVERY DAY SIMPLY TO MAKE IT WORK AND SO THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXTEND THEIR BUSINESS THROUGH THE INTERNET THROUGH THE OFFER OF A PARTNER- IS A COMPELLING OFFER BUT IT IT QUITE OFTEN DOESN'T. YIELD THE BENEFITS. THAT ARE PROMISED TOWARD MORE POORLY UNDERSTOOD SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO SOME RESEARCH BUT SOME MOON CONSEILS BILL. IS PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY IN A PROPER DISCLOSURE I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING- BUT I COMMEND MANY SERVICES FOR THE FOR THE VALUE THAT THEY PROVIDE BUT IN THIS IMPORTANT AT THE RESTAURANTS AND THEIR CONSUMERS ARE FULLY AWARE OF WHAT- THE NUMBER THEY ARE CALLING INCIDENT AND WHAT THAT ENTAILS THAT SHE'LL BE IN A CLASS WITH THE BILL TODAY GLAD TO MOVE IT WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE- AND I WOULD ASK YOU. ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR IF THAT'S POSSIBLE. I LOVE TO THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO NEWMAN I SEE. US AND FAN. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- SOME REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I THINK WHAT YOU KNOW IF THERE'S A CERTAINLY LOVE THE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE RESTAURANTS AND THE- AND THE- DELIVERY COMPANY AREN'T- APPS. OR IS ASIAN BUT WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT THE CONSUMER TO AM I MEAN BY THAT IS THAT. CERTAINLY IS A CONSUMER I'D LIKE TO ACTUALLY HAVE SOME CHOICE LIKE WHO I SUPPORT WITH MY SPENDING DOLLARS AND I THINK MANY CONSUMERS FEEL THAT WAY. AND SO- I THINK BLACK CONSUMERS WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT IF THEY GO TO A RESTAURANT AND THEY MAKE A CALL AND THE CALL NUMBER- WHERE THE MONEY IS GOING IN THE SENSE THAT IF THEY GIVE A TIP OR SOME OTHER THING IS IT WHO'S GOING TO WRITE AND I THINK THE- PEOPLE HAVE PERCEPTIONS OF WHAT I THINK IT'S GOING BUT IT'S NOT GOING WHERE PEOPLE PERCEIVE- THAT- THEN- THAT CAN BE A BIT DECEPTIVE SO. I DO APPRECIATE THIS EFFORT AT TRANSPARENCY- FEATURE YOUR WORK AT TO TRY TO BE SURE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO WORK SMOOTHLY. BUT ALSO CERTAINLY IS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER APPRECIATE BECAUSE OFTENTIMES SMALL BUSINESS DON'T HAVE LEVERAGE I THINK MOST IMPORTANTLY IS THAT- CONSUMERS. ACTUALLY- KIDS OF PEOPLE THEY WANT SUPPORT AND THEY CHOOSE NOT TO THEY AN CHOOSE NOT TO BUT- LET'S LET'S GIVE BE SURE TO CONSUMER HAVE SAYS TRANSPARENCY CHOICE. AND THAT SO THANK YOU. SERVER THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT TO YOU KNOW DO YOU TAKE THE CONCERN SERIOUSLY OF TECHNICAL TERMS RAISED I DO APPRECIATE AND HAVE A LOT OF CONVERSATION WITH THE AUTHOR AND APPRECIATE THE MINUTES THAT YOU'VE MADE- TO- WORK TO CLARIFY A LOT INTO TWO MOVIES BEFORE SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER AGAIN THANK YOU. IN DECEMBER THE TALK TO ME TALK TALK ME THROUGH THE ENFORCEMENT COMPONENT OF THIS RIGHT SO IS THAT THE CHARGES ONLY HAPPENED IF- PURCHASES MADE. HOW DO WE TRACK THAT HAD WE KNOWN HOW IS THAT IMPORTANT YEAH ACCORDING TO GRUBHUB ITSELF THEY ALREADY THEY ALREADY ARE ABLE TO WERE WERE ABLE TO- RECORD RECORD PHONE CALLS ABLE TO TRACK THAT AND THERE IS A MECHANISM IN WHICH BUSINESS OWNERS CAN DISPUTE SAID CALLS RIGHT TO SAY I CALLED YOUR BURGER RESTAURANT AND I JUST THREW THE BEFOREHAND WHEN THAT THIS WAS A PRACTICE ON YELP- AND I CALLED A GROUP OF PHONE NUMBER AND I SAID HEY. WHEN YOU WHEN YOU GUYS CLOSE TODAYYOU KNOW AND I JUST HUNG UP AFTER THAT THERE COULD BE COULD AND THERE ARE ALLEGED ALLEGATIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY NOW WHERE THERE ARE DUBIOUS CHARGES LIKE THAN THE RESTAURANTS THE RESTAURANTS CAN OF COURSE GO THROUGH THE RECORDS AND CHECK YOU CAN ALSO IMAGINE A SMALL MOM PA PLAN A SMALL MOM AND POP RSTAURANT SITUATION HOW ONEROUS AND PROBABLY NOT GOING TO GO TO CATCH THOSE THINGS. AND ALSO SOMETHING TO MENTION IS THIS CALL FORWARDING HAD BEEN LUMPED UNDER WHAT THEY HAD CALLED A MARKETING COMMISSION OUR MARKETING FEE THAT IS SINGLE HIGHEST COMMISSION INDIANS HIGHER ORDERING- JUST FOR REFERENCE BECAUSE I HAVE THE MODEL BILL THAT COMES FROM REPUBLIC SO. MARKETING WAS 20% OF EVERY ORDER DELIVERY WAS 10% ONLINE ORDERING LINK WAS ONE DOLLAR AND THE MICROSITE WHICH NOTHING IS ONE DOLLAR JUST FLAT FEE MARKETING ITSELF IN THE CONTRACTS IN THE CONTRACT THEY GIVE TO. THE RESTAURANTS WHICH IS IN VERY TINY FONT CAN EVEN SEE IT FROM HERE- HAS A VERY VAGUE MENTION OF CALL FORWARDING AT BEST I COULD ARGUE AND IT'S NOT VERY CLEAR THAT THAT HAPPENS RIGHT SO WHEN YOU'RE HOARDING SET TEN DOLLAR BURGER AND 20% OF THAT IS ON MARKETING THIS TWO DOLLARS RIGHT THERE AND I HAD A LOT OF THE MARGIN SO THERE ARE MECHANISMS IN WHICH THEY ALREADY CLAIM TO HAPPEN AND ALSO BROKE UP SAYS AS A MATTER OF POLICY. THEY DON'T CHARGE BUT HE DIDN'T THEY DON'T CHARGE PHONE CALLS. THAT DON'T RESULT IN ORDER AND WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT NOW. THE TO THE CHAIR ARE YOU ARE YOU THEN IS THE IS THE- THAT THAT. PER MARKET. THAT ONLY FOR THE CALL FORWARDING OR OR IS THAT NOT. IS THAT 20% IN MARKETING NOT ALSO OTHER FORMS OF ADVERTISING AND LISTING OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. SO THE 20% MARKETING FEE INCLUDES ALMOST EVERY ANYTHING IN ITS LEGAL DEFINITION OF THE TERMS IT COULD BE EVERYTHING FROM ONLINE ADVERTISEMENTS PHONE CALL EVEN USER AT IT COULD BE ANYTHING BUT CALL FORWARDING IS ALSO LISTED THERE SO IF YOU ARE A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER. YOU GOT TO REALLY DISSECT WHAT THAT CHARGES AND WHAT THAT MEANS OKAY SO IT'S NOT THIS TWENTY FIRST IS NOT 20% MARKUP FOR THAT CALL FORWARDING. IT TWENTY SEVEN MARKETING AND THAT CALL OF THAT 20% YES JUST TO BE CLEAR THIS BILL DOES NOT BAN THE PRACTICE- CALL FORWARDING. SO LONG AS IT RESULTS IN. AN UNPAID ORDER AND ALSO YOU KNOW A LISTING WHICH THEY COULD STILL DO IT SO LONG AS THE ACCURATE INFORMATION ACCURATE PHONE NUMBER. THANK YOU SENATOR SIR MELINDA'S. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN- I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS SO WHAT YOU DO YOU TALKED ABOUT- SPACE A CUSTOMER CALLS AND ASKS WHAT TIME DO YOU CLOSE TODAY AND THEY HNG UP AND THEN A RESTAURANT COULD BE CHARGED FOR THAT CALL SO. I GUESS I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE LOGISTICS OF THIS HOW DOES A RESTAURANT OWNER IF THEY ARE GOING TO GO THROUGH THE CALLS AND THE CHARGES HOW WOULD THEY KNOW THAT A CALL. THAT SOMEONE CALLED IN AND ONLY ASKED WHAT TIME THEY CLOSE AS OPPOSED TO SOMEBODY CALLED IN AND PLACED AN ORDER. IT'S A GREAT QUESTION I DON'T KNOW IF MY WITNESS RECESS STILL ON OR ANY OF MY WITNESSES IF THEY WANT EXPLAINED ON. THE LIKE DID A LOGISTICAL PART I WOULDN'T KNOW AS NOT A RESTAURANT OWNER BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE STILL ON BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW. A RESTAURANT OWNER COULD DISCERN BETWEEN A CALL THEY SHOULD E CHARGED FOR IN A CALL THAT PERHAPS THEY SHOULD NOT RIGHT AND I MEAN JUST TO PRACTICE IF THEY SAY YEAH THAT'S THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM IS MOST THE TIME IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DISCERN- I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE- STILL ON. WELL MY I GUESS MA'AM PERHAPS WHILE WE WAIT FOR HER IF SHE'S GOING TO COME BACK ON THE LINE- I READ THROUGH THE CONTRACT. AND I THINK THERE'S A SUGGESTION THAT PERHAPS WITH THE SMALLER RESTAURANTS- WHO DON'T HAVE A STAFF ATTORNEY THAT THEY'RE UNABLE TO DECIPHER YOU KNOW THE LEGALESE WITHIN THAT CONTRACT BUT I I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS COMMITTEE IN SO. YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON AND I DON'T I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S APPROPRIATE TO SUGGEST THAT BECAUSE IT'S A SMALL BUSINESS AND THEY DON'T HAVE A STAFF ATTORNEY THAT THEY'RE NOT STILL REQUIRED- AND BOUND TO. UNDERSTAND THE CONTRACT THAT THEY'RE SIGNING PERHAPS RUN IT BY YOU KNOW SOMEONE SO THAT THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE AGREEING TO BECAUSE IT IS A CONTRACT BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES- SO I'M WONDERING IS YOUR WITNESS IS COMING BACK. ANYONE BY HE WITNESS IS STILL ON THE LINE MR DURAN. WITNESS TO RESERVE. OKAY YES HELLO HI- SO ACTUALLY- WE HAVE NO WAY OF TELLING YOU KNOW WELL AT THE TIME OF THE CALL WHETHER YOU KNOW IT'S A CALL COMING IN FROM BUT PROBABLY NOT AND YOU KNOW THERE'S DIFFERENT STAFF WORKING IN YOU KNOW WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE TIME AND AN EFFORT. TO OKAY THING WHICH THE CALLS AND THEN YOU KNOW. WHERE YOUR RANKING ABOUT. HI WE WOULD USE CHARGES OR- THANK YOU THANK YOU MA'AM I APPRECIATE YOUR- PROVIDING CLARITY SO YOU SEE THE PROBLEM THAT I'M HAVING HERE IS THAT YOU'RE SAYING SOMEONE COULD YOU KNOW THEY THEY MAY BE GETTING CHARGED FOR BECAUSE THEY SHOULDN'T BE GETTING CHARGED FOR BUT IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT THERE'S ANY WAY FOR A RESTAURANT TO- OR ONE OF THESE PLATFORMS TO BE ABLE TO SAY. YES THIS WAS A LEGITIMATE CHARGER NO THIS WASN'T I DON'T KNOW HOW. I YEAH HOW YOU SOLVE THAT PROBLEM BUT YEAH- IS THAT I'M IN. A SEVEN EXCUSE ME MA'AM IF SOME WOMEN ONLY IF YOU COULD. ADDRESS THAT. I THINK YOU HAVE A VERY. IT'S A VALID CONCERN ABOUT IT BUT I THINK WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE COMMITTEE AS WELL AS BAPTIZING SMALL BUSINESSES AND IN A PERFECT WORLD WE ARM CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES WITH THE MOST INFORMED BUT THE MOST INFORMATION LIKE MOST INFORMED DECISIONS RIGHT BUT WE KNOW IN REAL LIFE AND IN PRACTICE THAT DOES NOT EXIST AND ESPECIALLY EXISTS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AS YOU HEARD WHO. YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW ARE HAVING STAFFING DIFFICULTIES ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY BEING UP WITH THE ONLINE ENVIRONMENT AS WELL SO IT'S NOT A PERFECT ENVIRONMENT AND HASN'T EVEN MENTIONED YOU KNOW THERE IS A BOUNTY THERE IS A THERE IS A TEMPTATION TO GO ONLINE PLATFORM SURVIVE AND WE THRIVE BUT PERHAPS A LOT OF TIMES THEY ARE SIGNING UP FOR THEY ARE GETTING EXACTLY THE SIGN UP FOR AND THAT'S THE CASE A LOT OF BUSINESSES THAT GO ON. THIRD PARTY PLATFORMS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT'LL HAVE MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR. I SEE NO OTHER MIKES UP. SO WITH SOME REMEMBER LEE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I APPRECIATE THE ROBUST DISCUSSION AND WE- HOPE THAT WE CAN BE A PASS THIS BILL. THEY ARE SMALL BUSINESSES ARE DEFINITELY STILL HURTING. AND I DO THINK THAT- REMOTE ORDERING WHETHER BE TELEPHONICALLY OR DIGITAL IS HERE TO STAY FOR THE NUMEROUS CONSUMERS GAIN MORE MORE USED TO IT. SO WE SHOULD BE EQUIPPING CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES ALIKE WITH AS MUCH INFORMATION TRANSPARENCY AS POSSIBLE. AND AGAIN THANK. THE CHAIR FOR HIS. AMENDMENTS AND DISCLOSURE BECAUSE I DO THINK THE- THE SUGGESTION FOURTEEN POINT. FOURTEEN POINT FIVE IS GREAT BECAUSE I'M A CURRENT CONTRACT LANGUAGE MUST BE IN POINT. SIX OR SOMETHING BECAUSE IF. IF IT NOW SAYS HIS POINT TEN IT'S MUCH LESS OF THAT SO THANK YOU SO MUCH AND- TONIGHT FOLKS. THANK YOU SIR AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR WORKING WITH US ON THOSE AMENDMENTS.
