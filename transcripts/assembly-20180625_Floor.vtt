GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND I

02:28:12.350 --> 02:28:15.820 region:rollup2
THINK AS GOOD STEWARDS OF THAT'S

02:28:13.885 --> 02:28:16.321 region:rollup2
TAXPAYER MONEY WE ARE OBLIGATED

02:28:15.820 --> 02:28:17.155 region:rollup2

EFFICIENT WAY THAT WE POSSIBLY

02:28:17.155 --> 02:28:20.024 region:rollup2
CAN.

02:28:18.456 --> 02:28:21.226 region:rollup2
FORTUNATELY FOR US EFFICIENCY IS

02:28:20.024 --> 02:28:22.961 region:rollup2
VERY EASY TO MEASURE WHEN YOU'RE

02:28:21.226 --> 02:28:23.895 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT GREENHOUSE GAS

02:28:22.961 --> 02:28:25.530 region:rollup2
REDUCTIONS IF YOUR LOOKING AT A

02:28:23.895 --> 02:28:26.631 region:rollup2
PROGRAM YOU TAKE THE TOTAL COST

02:28:25.530 --> 02:28:28.500 region:rollup2
OF THE PROGRAM.

02:28:26.631 --> 02:28:30.068 region:rollup2
IN DOLLARS AND YOU DIVIDE BY THE

02:28:28.500 --> 02:28:31.903 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF TONS OF CARBON THAT

02:28:30.068 --> 02:28:34.139 region:rollup2
THAT PROGRAM REDUCES.

02:28:31.903 --> 02:28:35.974 region:rollup2
AND THAT GIVES YOU THE COST OF

02:28:34.139 --> 02:28:37.609 region:rollup2
REDUCING EACH TON OF CARBON.

02:28:35.974 --> 02:28:39.310 region:rollup2
SO THOUGH THE LOWER THE COST OF

02:28:37.609 --> 02:28:40.378 region:rollup2
REDUCTION THE HIGHER THE

02:28:39.310 --> 02:28:42.046 region:rollup2
EFFICIENCY OF THE PROGRAM SO

02:28:40.378 --> 02:28:43.815 region:rollup2
JUST FOR COMPARISON SOME OF THE

02:28:42.046 --> 02:28:45.416 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT ARE FUNDED IN THIS

02:28:43.815 --> 02:28:46.017 region:rollup2
TRAILER BILL ARE VERY EFFICIENT

02:28:45.416 --> 02:28:47.485 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE.

02:28:46.017 --> 02:28:49.754 region:rollup2
HEALTHY FORESTS DAIRY DIE

02:28:47.485 --> 02:28:51.489 region:rollup2
GESTURES ORGANIC RECYCLING.

02:28:49.754 --> 02:28:52.857 region:rollup2
COST PER TON OF CARBON REDUCED

02:28:51.489 --> 02:28:54.759 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE PROGRAMS IS UNDER TEN

02:28:52.857 --> 02:28:55.927 region:rollup2
DOLLARS PER TON.

02:28:54.759 --> 02:28:57.862 region:rollup2
HOWEVER THERE ARE OME VERY

02:28:55.927 --> 02:28:59.397 region:rollup2
INEFFICIENT USES OF THE MONEY

02:28:57.862 --> 02:29:00.598 region:rollup2
CONTAINED IN THIS TRAILER BILL

02:28:59.397 --> 02:29:02.267 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE THE CLEAN VEHICLE

02:29:00.598 --> 02:29:04.169 region:rollup2
REBATE PROGRAM THAT'S ACOSTA

02:29:02.267 --> 02:29:04.702 region:rollup2
OVER FORTY SIX DOLLARS PER TON

02:29:04.169 --> 02:29:06.004 region:rollup2
OF CARBON REDUCED IN OTHER

02:29:04.702 --> 02:29:06.471 region:rollup2
WORDS.

02:29:06.004 --> 02:29:07.605 region:rollup2
THAT'S FOUR TIMES LESS

02:29:06.471 --> 02:29:09.207 region:rollup2
EFFICIENT.

02:29:07.605 --> 02:29:11.142 region:rollup2
I IN THEIR PROGRAMS LIKE THE

02:29:09.207 --> 02:29:12.510 region:rollup2
CLEAN TRUCK AND BUS BELCHER

02:29:11.142 --> 02:29:14.813 region:rollup2

02:29:12.510 --> 02:29:16.481 region:rollup2
COST OF OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND

02:29:14.813 --> 02:29:18.216 region:rollup2
FIFTY DOLLARS PER TON OF CARBON.

02:29:16.481 --> 02:29:19.250 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S OVER FORTY TIMES LESS

02:29:18.216 --> 02:29:21.019 region:rollup2
EFFICIENT THAN THE MOST

02:29:19.250 --> 02:29:22.053 region:rollup2
EFFICIENT USES IN THIS BILL.

02:29:21.019 --> 02:29:24.355 region:rollup2
I TO PUT IT A DIFFERENT WAY

02:29:22.053 --> 02:29:25.990 region:rollup2
MEMBERS WE COULD BE DOING A LOT

02:29:24.355 --> 02:29:27.525 region:rollup2
BETTER JOB AT REDUCING CARBON WE

02:29:25.990 --> 02:29:29.194 region:rollup2
COULD REDUCE MANY MORE TONS OF

02:29:27.525 --> 02:29:30.261 region:rollup2
CARBON DIOXIDE THAN WE DO IN

02:29:29.194 --> 02:29:31.930 region:rollup2
THIS TRAILER BILL.

02:29:30.261 --> 02:29:36.468 region:rollup2
AND FOR THIS REASON I FEEL IT

02:29:31.930 --> 02:29:37.735 region:rollup2

GOING TO THE NATIONAL

AGRICULTURAL SURVEY OVER 60% OF

VARIOUS SOURCES ESTIMATE THAT.

02:40:24.949 --> 02:40:28.686 region:rollup2
THAT NUMBER COULD BE CLOSER

02:40:28.686 --> 02:40:31.989 region:rollup2
IT DOES NOT AUTHORIZE WORKERS

02:40:30.154 --> 02:40:33.491 region:rollup2

02:40:31.989 --> 02:40:36.560 region:rollup2
RESULT IN THE NATIONAL.

02:40:33.491 --> 02:40:37.995 region:rollup2
WHITE FOOD SHORTAGE CRISIS WELL

02:40:36.560 --> 02:40:38.829 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE THAT THE STATE SHOULD

02:40:37.995 --> 02:40:40.798 region:rollup2
HAVE THE RIGHT TO ADDRESS OUR

02:40:38.829 --> 02:40:42.132 region:rollup2
OWN LABOR ISSUES.

02:40:40.798 --> 02:40:43.634 region:rollup2
THE US CONSTITUTION MAKES IT

02:40:42.132 --> 02:40:44.768 region:rollup2
EXPLICITLY CLEAR.

02:40:43.634 --> 02:40:45.402 region:rollup2
THAT IMMIGRATION ISSUES ARE

02:40:44.768 --> 02:40:47.605 region:rollup2
UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE

02:40:45.402 --> 02:40:49.373 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

02:40:47.605 --> 02:40:50.374 region:rollup2
TODAY'S FARMWORKERS ARE AGING.

02:40:49.373 --> 02:40:51.809 region:rollup2
AND THEIR CHILDREN DON'T WANT TO

02:40:50.374 --> 02:40:53.077 region:rollup2
DO THIS WORK.

02:40:51.809 --> 02:40:54.211 region:rollup2
MEANWHILE THERE ARE FEWER

02:40:53.077 --> 02:40:55.779 region:rollup2
IMMIGRANTS COMING TO THE COUNTRY

02:40:54.211 --> 02:40:56.981 region:rollup2
TO REPLACE.

02:40:55.779 --> 02:40:58.682 region:rollup2
THOSE INDIVIDUALS DOING THESE

02:40:56.981 --> 02:41:00.117 region:rollup2
JOBS.

02:40:58.682 --> 02:41:01.218 region:rollup2
THIS RESOLUTION WOULD PUT THE

02:41:00.117 --> 02:41:02.753 region:rollup2
ISSUE OF LABOR SHORTAGES ON THE

02:41:01.218 --> 02:41:04.088 region:rollup2
RADAR.

02:41:02.753 --> 02:41:05.656 region:rollup2
OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND

02:41:04.088 --> 02:41:07.224 region:rollup2
WOULD URGE CONGRESS TO ALLOW

02:41:05.656 --> 02:41:08.926 region:rollup2
STATES TO ADDRESS THEIR OWN

02:41:07.224 --> 02:41:10.427 region:rollup2
LABOR ISSUES MEMBERS.

02:41:08.926 --> 02:41:11.495 region:rollup2
I THINK GOD THIS IS AN ISSUE

02:41:10.427 --> 02:41:12.963 region:rollup2
THAT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO

02:41:11.495 --> 02:41:14.632 region:rollup2
DIVORCE.

02:41:12.963 --> 02:41:16.834 region:rollup2
FROM THE CURRENT NATIONAL

02:41:14.632 --> 02:41:17.868 region:rollup2

AND CERTAINLY --

02:41:21.672 --> 02:41:26.577 region:rollup2
IMPOSSIBLE TO DIVORCE FROM THE

02:41:23.908 --> 02:41:28.312 region:rollup2
CURRENT SITUATION AT THE BORDER.

02:41:26.577 --> 02:41:30.047 region:rollup2
AS CALIFORNIA DEPENDS HEAVILY ON

AGRICULTURE ECONOMY.

02:41:30.047 --> 02:41:33.617 region:rollup2

STABLE WORKFORCE.

02:41:33.617 --> 02:41:36.620 region:rollup2
I THINK NOW MORE THAN EVER WE

02:41:36.620 --> 02:41:39.957 region:rollup2
