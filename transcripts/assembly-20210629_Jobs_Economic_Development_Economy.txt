ENFORCEMENT AND TO TRY TO MAKE IT UP CONTINUE TO MAKE IT  POSITIVE PROGRAM TO TRY TO ENCOURAGE BUSINESSES TO PARTICIPATE AND FOR THAT REASON THAT'S WHY I'LL BE WORKING WITH THE YOUR CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF TO TRY TO REFINE THE ENFORCEMENT PIECE SO WE GET THAT RIGHT THE RIGHT BALANCE OF WEEK CONTINUE TO GO FORWARD WITH A POSITIVE PROGRAM NOT A NEGATIVE ONE BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE MAKE SURE THAT THE FOLKS THAT ARE SELF CERTIFYING THAT 51% OR GREATER IN FACT OUR MANUFACTURING WITH GREATER THAN A 51% OR MORE.
