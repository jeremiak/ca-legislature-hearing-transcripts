THANK YOU WILL HOLD THE ROLE OF THE TRAPS OF MEMBERS NEVER GONNA HEAR OFF FOR MY FIRST AUTHOR CENTER PER PORTANTINO TO PRESENT OUR FIRST BILL SB SIX TWELVE WELCOME CENTER PORTANTINO THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. AS THE CHAIR MENTION I'M PRESENTING SP SIX TWELVE WHICH ENSURES A FAIR AND EQUAL ACCESS TO THE BENEFITS OF LEGACY CONTRACT RESOURCES FOR ALL CUSTOMERS AND ENSURES THAT I OWE YOU PORTFOLIOS ARE MANAGED TO MAXIMIZE VALUE AND REDUCE UNNECESSARY COSTS FOR ALL CUSTOMERS I WANT TO BEGIN-BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND THANK HIM COMMITTEE IN THE CHAIR AND HIS STAFF. FOR WORKING WITH MY STAFF ON THIS MEASURE. TO BRING US TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY. ANY LIKE CITY PA. AND CAL WERE. YEARS AGO. WHEN INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES- PREPARE THE PREDOMINANT PROVIDER OF ENERGY DO NOT REFLECT CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT LANDSCAPE. NO LONGER DO THE BALL CALIFORNIANS THE BULK OF CALIFORNIANS RECEIVE POWER FROM THE BIG THREE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES- PGD SEVEN CALIFORNIA EDISON AND SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC. IN FACT OVER THE LAST DESK DECADE MORE THAN ELEVEN MILLION PEOPLE IN MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED CITIES AND COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE. HAVE TRANSITIONED TO COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION OR CCS. C. NOW OCT ONE THIRD. OF THE ORIGINAL I OWE YOU FOOT PRINT AND APPROXIMATELY 50% OF PG'S ORIGINAL SERVICE TERRY ALONE IS NOW- IT ALONE AND THAT NUMBER IS EXPECTED TO GROW SIGNIFICANTLY MORE. MOST OF YOU HAVE CCA'S IN YOUR DISTRICT AND IF YOU DON'T. I CAN GUARANTEE YOU THERE YOUR COMMUNITIES ARE CONSIDERING IT. COMBINED THE CCA TRANSITION WITH THE EXPANSION OF DIRECT ACCESS WE HAVE VERY DIFFERENT LANDSCAPE THAN WE DID JUST A DECADE AGO ONE POLICY AREA. THAT IS OUTDATED AND REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ATTENTION BECAUSE OF ITS IMPACT ON RATEPAYERS HIS LEGACY ENERGY RESOURCES. AS PART OF THE TRANSITION TO A CCA CUSTOMERS MUST SHARE IN THE COST RESPONSIBILITY WITH HIGHER YOU CUSTOMERS FOR I OWE YOU GENERATION AND ELECTRIC. ELECTRICITY SUPPLY CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO BY- YOU I- USE PRIOR TO CCA CUSTOMERS DEPARTURE FOR CCA SERVICE. POLICY CUSTOMERS MUST PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE OF THE CONTRACTS AT ISSUE SEVERAL YEARS AGO THEY DO NOT HAVE FAIR ACCESS TO THE FULL RANGE OF BENEFICIAL RESOURCES THESE CONTRACTS PROVIDE. THOSE BENEFITS ARE RETAINED BY THE AYE YOU USE FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS. AS A RESULT CCA CUSTOMERS MUST TURN TO INCREASINGLY SCARCE MARKETS. TO PROCURE RESOURCES TO SERVE THEIR CUSTOMERS WHY I OWE YOU CUSTOMERS HAVE A FULL PORTFOLIO OF RESOURCES AT THEIR DISPOSAL RESOURCES THAT ARE SUBSIDIZED BY CCA CUSTOMERS. THERE SIMPLY IS NO GOOD POLICY RATIONALE FOR THIS INEQUITABLE TREATMENT OF CCA CUSTOMERS VERSUS I. O. U. COUNTERPARTS. SO HOW DOES THIS BILL FIX THIS INEQUITY SB SIX TWELVE SIMPLY PROVIDES FAIR AND EQUAL ACCESS TO THE BENEFITS OF LEGACY RESOURCES AND CONTRACTS FOR ALL CUSTOMERS. AND ENSURES THAT I OWE YOU PORTFOLIOS ARE MANAGED TO MAXIMIZE VALUE AND REDUCE UNNECESSARY COSTS FOR ALL CUSTOMERS SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL PROVIDES CUSTOMERS EQUAL ACCESS TO LEGACY PRODUCTS THAT THEY ARE PAYING FOR. THE PROPORTION. TO WHAT THEY'RE PAYING NOW. IT REQUIRES I OWE YOU. TEN CELL ANY REMAINING ACCESS LEGACY PRODUCTS NOT TAKEN BY CUSTOMER TO THE WHOLE MARKET AND LASTLY REQUIRES CPU TO RECOGNIZE THE OF H.

UTILITIES CHARACTER FOR CUSTOMERS WHO THEN LAST UTILITY PROCUREMENT SERVICES FOR CCA SERVICE ANOTHER CUSTOMERS TO REMAIN WITH UTILITY PROCUREMENT SERVICE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY MORE BECAUSE OF THAT AND THAT'S WHY THERE IS THE PPA CHARGE AND IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT UTILITY SHAREHOLDERS DO NOT MAKE PROFITS OR INCUR ANY LOSS FROM THE PPA CHARGE. ALL ABOUT WHICH CUSTOMERS PAY. FOR THE ALREADY PICTURED ENERGY. AS RIGHT IN THIS MANDATE THE COSTS BE SURE. IF YOU CUSTOM. ABOUT W. TWO COSTS THIS IS. UNACCEPTABLE UNEX.

WHAT WOULD THE PCA CHARGE BUT THE CCA'S R. NOT HAPPY WITH THE PC DECISION AND THEY WANT THE LEGISLATURE TO MANDATE THAT I USE GET RID OF MORE P. C. I. A. PORTFOLIO REQUIRES THAT. WHETHER THEY ARE ACCESS OR NOT THIS WOULD INCREASE THE BILL THE BUNDLE UTILITY CUSTOMERS BECAUSE I'LL USE WOULD THEN HAVE TO PUT YOUR MORE RESOURCES. TO MEET ANY SHORTFALL. THEREFORE CORRECT THE WM. ACCESS RESTORE TO RESOURCES WHICH ARE ONLY OUR PS THREE. THANK THE CPA'S ALSO. THAT THE VALUE GIVEN TO G. H. FREE RESOURCE IN THE P. CALCULAR IS TO. THE VALUE IS CURRENTLY BASED ON PRICE THE PAID ACTUAL MARKET TRANSACTIONS BUT THE CPA'S WANTING HIGHER HERE READ THE FULL BALLY FOR GHG FREE RESOURCES SO THEY CAN INCREASE THE PCIE CHARGE.

I'VE HEARD FROM SOME AND I'M STILL WAITING HEREBY FROM OTHERS NUMBERS SUPPORT THIS TODAY BUT I WANT TO RESERVE MY RIGHT AS WE MOVE FORWARD. SEE TO SEE HOW IT IMPACTS. I MEAN I UNDERSTAND BUT IT ALSO SOUNDS LIKE THOSE. ON REGULAR UTILITIES THEIR PRICES WILL GO UP AS IS MY LARGEST CITY THANK. I THINK CENTER HERTZBERG. K. AS USER THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SURE YEAH I JUST WANT TO JOIN WITH CENTER EGGMAN ON ON HER CONCERNS AND THE LIKE LOOK I THINK THE AMENDMENTS FROM WHAT I CAN DETERMINE THAT HELP DRAMATICALLY. BUT I JUST HISTORICALLY WANT TO PUT THIS IN CONTEXT CENTER MAKE DURING THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN CHAIR OF PROBATION IS BIG AND- INDUCES BILL BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TWO TO CREATE CCA'S. AND WE ARE DO WE ARE TRYING TO DEVELOP IN A VERY. APPROPRIATE MANNER THIS BALANCE WHERE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE DEAL WITH THE GHGS AND GREEN ENERGY IS AS BEST AS WE CAN. BUT I'M SO. SCARRED BY THE ENERGY CRISIS THAT I AM SCARED. BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S ALIVE THESE FOLKS HAVE- BALANCE SHEETS IT'S EASY FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO SAY AND LIST ON HERE WE WANTED OF COURSE. BUT THERE ARE PUTTING UP THEIR FULL FAITH AND CREDIT OF THEIR CITIES TO DO SO. THEY'RE THEY'RE CHERRY PICKING IN AND IT CREATES THIS CHALLENGE NOW THE P. YOU SEE HAS BEEN VERY SLOW AND DRAGGING ITS FEET. IN THIS PROCESS AND I UNDERSTAND THE FRUSTRATION. BUT WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH THIS WHOLE ISSUE OF- YOU KNOW AND I REMEMBER COMING HERE IF YOU LOOK AT THE RELATED BILLS ARE HERTZBERG BILLS HAVE BEEN DEALING IN THE SYRIAN THE DETAIL FOR A LONG TIME HIS POWERS CHARGING DIFFERENCE ADJUSTMENT. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT POLAR WE DO THE BILL AND PRIVATE THE PROVIDERS OF LAST RESORT. THE ONE THING WE CAN'T HAVE HAPPEN. IS ANOTHER ENERGY CRISIS WE SAW THE TEMPERATURES GO UP TO A HUNDRED THIRTY DEGREES. LAST YEAR WE KNOW THAT IMPACTS A LOT OF RENEWABLES BOTH BATTERIES AND SOLAR. WE EXPECT IT TO HAPPEN AGAIN THIS YEAR IN THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES I'VE GOT TWO BILLS HERE TODAY. DEALING WITH THIS TRYING TO. ADJUST FOR LONGER TERM THINKING SO I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY. BUT I'M JUST NERVOUS ABOUT THIS LARGER ISSUE. AND CONCERNED THAT THIS IS LIKE A IT REMINDS ME OF NINETEEN NINETY FOUR WHEN WE WENT OUT. DEREGULATE EVERYTHING EVERYBODY WAS HAPPY ABOUT IT AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THE WORLD WENT UPSIDE DOWN. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH BOOTS BELTS AND SUSPENDERS AND ALL THIS STUFF. AND RESOURCE ADEQUACY WHEN I INTERVIEWED WHEN I WAS A RULES COMMITTEE. THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AT AT AT THE CALAIS SO. YOU KNOW HE WAS SAYING THE PROBLEM LAST YEAR'S WE DID HAVE A- A ROBUST ENOUGH RESOURCE ADEQUACY. SO ALL OF THIS STUFF RESOURCE ADEQUACY POLAR PROVIDERS OF LAST RESORT ALL OF THESE ISSUES. ARE PART OF THIS LARGER DYNAMIC I SEE THIS IS. AN EFFORT TO. TO PUSH THE- PC A LITTLE BIT OR MAYBE AS WAS SUGGESTED THERE WERE SOME THAT WEREN'T AS HAPPY WITH THAT. MISS SUPPORT THIS TONIGHT I HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE IN THE- THE AUTHOR OF THIS AND I BELIEVE THAT THE AMENDMENTS WENT PRETTY FAR IN HELPING. THIS MEASURE ALONG I JUST HAVE A CHANCE. TO ANALYZE THEM SO. MARTIN BUT I WANT TO THAT. ON WITH MY WRIST TO MY VOTER COMES FOR EXAMPLE. THANK YOU CENTER BACKERS AT YOUR MAKE UP. THANK YOU I JUST IF YOU WANT TO ECHO I THINK THESE ARE COMPLEX ISSUES AND IT'S NICE TO SEE CPUC FROM STARTING TO. TO MOVE BUT I DO. WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR I AGREE THAT- THE SUPPORTING THE CUSTOMERS ARE PAYING FOR THEIR FAIR SHARE OF THE COSTS OF LEGACY RESOURCES AND THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THEY GET THEIR SHARE THE BENEFITS AS WELL SO I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR. BRINGING THIS FOR. SENATOR BRADFORD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I TO REMAIN ON A NOTE IN A NOTE OF CAUTION HERE- I KNOW OUR MAJORITY LEADER LIVE DIRECTLY THROUGH THE ENERGY CRISIS AS SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY BUT I DID SO AS AN EMPLOYEE OF A MAJOR UTILITY AND WE HAVE TO BE MINDFUL THAT. YES WE ALL ABOUT CHOICE BUT. I'M JUST CONCERNED CCA'S AS THE MAJORITY LEADER STATED THERE'S NO BALANCE SHEET HERE THERE'S NO EMPLOYEES THEY'RE STILL DEPENDENT ON THE SAME UTILITIES THAT THEY SAY THEY WANT TO BREAK AWAY FROM FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE BILLING FOR THE METER READING ALL THOSE THINGS THAT ISSUE SHE WILL NEVER DO. AND THERE'S NO GREATER POOL OF RENEWABLE OR CLEAN ENERGY THAT'S AVAILABLE TO THEM THAT IT'S AVAILABLE TO DIAL USER APPEAL USE IT'S THE SAME PART OF RENEWABLE ENERGY NO GREATER SOURCE FILLED TO CONTINUE TO SAY THAT. THEIR CLEANER AND BETTER IT'S JUST A FALLACY TO IT'S A IT'S A POSSIBILITY- AND WE THROUGH LEGISLATION OVER THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS HAVE PUSH UTILITIES TO THE POINT OF LONG TERM CONTRACTS OF RENEWABLE ENERGY AND NOW WE'RE LETTING ALL THEIR CUSTOMERS MIGRATE AWAY. AND WE SAY IT'S COMMUNITY CHOICE BUT REALLY IT'S NOT IT'S COMMUNITY FORCE BECAUSE IT FORCED UPON THEM BY CITIES ABOUT ELECTED LEADERS WHO ARE MAKING DECISION NOT INDIVIDUAL RATEPAYERS BECAUSE IF YOU TALK TO THE INNER INDIVIDUAL REPAIR THEY DON'T KNOW THEY'RE PART OF A C. C. A. VERSUS I OWE YOU HE STILL GET THEIR BILL FROM. THEIR REGULAR. FIVE INCUMBENT. UTILITIES STILL. I WISH YOU WEREN'T. COMMUNITY CHOICE. IF IT WORK IT WOULD BE. IN PURSES OPT OUT. I'VE SAID IN A TALKED TO ROOMS OF. ELECTED OFFICIALS OVER LAST TWO YEARS MANY OF WHOM WERE PART OF CCA'S AND A NEW. REALLY NOTHING ABOUT THE MECHANICS OF EACH YEAR I'VE TALKED TO HUNDREDS OF CUSTOMERS WHO LIVE IN DISTRICTS THAT ARE C. CA AND THEY WEREN'T THE LEAST BIT AWARE THAT THEY WERE PART OF A CCA BECAUSE AGAIN. THE COMMUNITY TO MAKE THE CHOICE ELECTED OFFICIALS MAKE THEIR CHOICE FOR THEM. AND I THINK IT WOULD BUT ANYWAY.

CLOSELY WITH IBEW TO RESOLVE THEIR ISSUES AND MADE AMENDMENTS INCOMING FINANCE OTHER CAUSE THE REMOVAL OF THAT OUR POSITIONS I WANT TO THANK IPW FOR WORKING WITH US. I'M CALLING THIS PROCESS SIX SEVENTEEN REQUIRES- JURISDICTIONS OF A CERTAIN SIZE TO IMPLEMENT AUTOMATED ONLINE SOLAR PERMITTING FOR SIMPLE RESIDENTIAL ROOFTOP SOLAR AND SOLAR PLUS STORAGE SYSTEMS THIS IS. ABOUT REALLY SINGLE FAMILY HOMES AND IT'S ABOUT SIMPLE SYSTEMS NOT LARGE COMPLICATED SYSTEMS FURTHER THE BILL DIRECTS- THE ENERGY COMMISSION TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND GRANTS TO JURISDICTIONS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AUTOMATED ONLINE PERMITTING SYSTEMS AS DESCRIBED IN THE OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH IS- A SOLAR PERMITTING GUIDEBOOK BOTTOM ITS SOLAR PERMITTING IS ONE OF THE MAIN METHODS FOR AVOIDING UNNECESSARY DELAYS. SAVING FINANCIAL AND STAFF RESOURCES AND INCREASING THROUGHPUT OF PERMITS CURRENTLY SOLAR PERMITTING PROCESSES ARE OFTEN NOT ALWAYS BUT OFTEN INEFFICIENT- CAN RESULT CAN INCREASE OFF COSTS BY UPWARDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS INCREASE THE NUMBER OF APPLICANTS A DROP AL PRIOR TO INSTALLATION AND DETER POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS FROM ENGAGING IN A DRAWN OUT PROCESS TOGETHER RESIDENTIAL SOLAR SYSTEM. AUTOMATED ONLINE SOLAR PERMITTING ALLOWS FOR A SIMPLIFIED AND FAR MORE EFFICIENT SOLUTION BY ALLOWING APPLICANTS TO APPLY AND IMMEDIATELY DETERMINE IF THE PROPOSED. SYSTEM IS CODE COMPLIANT. KERN ALL PER SYSTEM ARE KEY OF FOR HANDLING. TIMES MORE PERMITS THAN TYPICAL METHODS SAN JOSE RECENTLY IMPLEMENTED AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM SALAS 6100% INCREASE IN PERMITS. THIS INCREASED VOLUME OF PERMITS IS NOT A BURDEN ON BUILDING DEPARTMENT STAFF. AS pPERMITS SO OFTEN THE LARGEST PORTION OF PERMITS BEING DEALT WITH THE MATTER IS AUTOMATICALLY. FURTHER DEPARTMENTS WILL COLLECT FEES ARE FOR ME TO PERMITS OR NOT REDUCING THE FEES THAT THEY COLLECT GENERATING SIGNIFICANTLY MORE REVENUE DUE TO THE UP TICK IN CASELOADS. TO SISTER INSTRUCTIONS ARE WHICH MAY STRUGGLE IMPLEMENTING SUCH A SYSTEM SB SIX SEVENTEEN CREATES A PROGRAM AT THE ENERGY COMMISSION TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE- ALTHOUGH SB SIX SEVENTEEN DOES NOT MANDATE A SPECIFIC TECHNOLOGY OR SYSTEM. THE BILL'S INTENT IS DIRECTLY TIED TO SOLAR OP A RECENTLY DEVELOPED SOFTWARE FROM THE- NATIONAL RENEWABLE ENERGY LAB AND ARIELLE WHICH IS- PART OF THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY. WHICH WAS CREATED ALONGSIDE BUILDING DEPARTMENT SAFETY EXPERTS SOLAR INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS AND OTHERS. SOLAR APP IS FREE AND OPEN SOURCE AND CAN BE EASILY. IMPLEMENTED BY ANY JURISDICTION. BUILDING THE WILL BE ABLE TO ON BOARD THIS WITH IN I FOR. AND EVEN MERGE THE PROGRAM WITH OTHER COMMONLY UTILIZED GOVERNMENT SOFTWARE FURTHERMORE THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY AND ARIELLE WE'RE COMMITTED TO THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF SOLAR UP. AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDS HAS BEEN APPROPRIATED TO SUPPORT THE SOFTWARE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. ON SOLAR OUT SPECIFICATIONS ARE BASED ON MODEL BUILDING AN ELECTRICAL FIRE CODES AND ACROSS REFERENCE WITH THE LEADING PERMITTING GUIDEBOOKS IN CALIFORNIA. OVER FIFTY JURISDICTIONS ARE IN THE PROCESS OF EVALUATING THE SOFTWARE AND CITIES SUCH AS MODESTO MENIFEE OCEANSIDE IN PLEASANT HILL. ARE ALL IN VARIOUS STAGES OF ADOPTION NONE OF WHOM HAVE INDICATED ANY MAJOR ISSUES. I'M MORE THAN ANYTHING SB SIX SEVENTEEN AS A CLIMATE BILL WHETHER JURISDICTION UTILIZES SOLAR OP OR CREATE THEIR OWN AUTOMATED PERMITTING SYSTEM BOTH WILL HELP BUILD MORE SOLAR.
