BY THE COMMITTEE. THIS BILL IS LONG OVERDUE. IS A DOWN PAYMENT TOWARDS STATE PLAYING A MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN DISMANTLING OVER THREE HUNDRED YEARS OF RACIAL INEQUITIES IN ENDING SYSTEMIC RACISM. EXTENSIVE RESEARCH HAS IDENTIFIED RACISM IS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS LEADING TO SIGNIFICANT HEALTH DISPARITIES INCLUDING INFANT AND MATERNAL MORTALITY CHRONIC DISEASE PREVALENCE. BUT EXPECTANCY AND NOW COVERED MORTALITY. LAST YEAR ACTUALLY THIS PAST YEAR PANDEMIC LAID BARE SYSTEMIC INEQUITIES THAT RUN DEEP IN OUR SOCIETY AND INSTITUTIONS. AT THE SAME TIME LAST SUMMER WE SAW THE SURGEONS OF RACIAL JUSTICE PROTEST HIS BONTA MURDERS OF FLOYD BEYOND A TAILOR AND SO MANY MORE. AND AGAIN WE ARE NOW SEEING ANOTHER RISE OF VIOLENCE AND HATRED TOWARD THE EIGHTY I COMMUNITY. THANK RECENTLY DAILY TIMES REPORTED ON THE HISTORY OF ANTI ASIAN SENTIMENTS AND POLICIES HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE VERY LONG HISTORY OF THIS. IN MANY WAYS THESE INCIDENTS WHILE CALLING UNFORTUNATELY ARE NEITHER NEW NOR SURPRISING. AND THE CONDITIONS THAT LED TO THESE INEQUITIES HAVE BEEN BREWING FOR A LONG TIME. IT WAS CERTAINLY THE STATE HAS MADE EFFORTS TECHNOLOGY CONFRONT RACIAL DISPARITIES. RECENT YEARS EQUITIES OFTEN TREATED AS AN AFTERTHOUGHT OR IS A SILENT STRATEGY. IT'S NOT JUST ENOUGH TO DECLARE RACISM AS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS IS SO MANY OF OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. HAVE HAVE DONE AND DISCUSS OTHER PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE WE MUST ALSO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. THE STATE NEEDS AN INDEPENDENT BODY TO HOLD US ACCOUNTABLE BY SAMMY CALIFORNIA'S POLICIES AND BUDGET WITH THE GOAL OF ACHIEVING RACIAL EQUITY IN ENDING SYSTEMIC RACISM.

SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. UP I JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD- I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR THE POINT AS I THINK OTHERS SPEAKERS AS WELL AS THE AUTHOR DID A GREAT JOB OF HIGHLIGHTING WHY THIS IS. IMPORTANT AS WE KNOW THAT RACIAL AND HOLD DISPARITIES EXIST AND ESPECIALLY DURING THE PANDEMIC IT'S BEEN EXTREMELY CLEAR THAT- COMMUNITIES OF COLOR MINORITY COMMUNITIES ARE THE ONES THAT ARE HARDEST HIT. AND SO I JUST WANT TO REITERATE SOMETHING IN ONE OF THE SPEAKERS SET AND MEENA KNOWING THAT RACE ON HEALTH DISPARITIES EXIST RESPONSE HAS TO BE. THIS MONTH SYSTEMATIC I'M SORRY IT WILL BE SYSTEMATIC IN TERMS OF IDENTIFYING DEVELOPING STRATEGIES. AND ELIMINATING WASTE ON HOLD DISPARITIES SELL WITHOUT- I WANT BY LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CLOCK WHEN APPROPRIATE AND WITH THAT I WANT TO MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU WE HAVE A MOTION BY. THE- DOCTOR PAN BEFORE- WE GO TO THE VOTE- FOR THE RECORD I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS ON PAGE TEN OF THE ANALYSIS AS WELL AS THE- SEVEN YEAR SUNSET CORRECT YES CORRECT. WHAT I'M SORRY MR BECK CENTER BACKER I DID NOT SEE THAT MICROPHONE GO AHEAD. MISTER CHAIR JUST A QUICK COMMENT AS WELL TO THANK THE AUTHOR- IT'S OF COURSE VERY TIMELY. BILL AND A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM REQUIRES A SYSTEMIC RESPONSE AND THAT'S WHY IN SUPPORT OF THIS I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO BE. ADDED TO A CO AUTHOR IF YOU'RE ACCEPTING CO AUTHORS AND I. APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATION. FANTASTIC SENATOR. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR I'M IT'S TIME FOR SOMEONE SPEAK FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND OUR CONSTITUTION. YOU MAY HAVE ISSUES WITH OUR CONSTITUTION THAT GOES BACK OVER TWO HUNDRED YEARS. THE FOUNDERS ANTICIPATED THAT AND SET IN PLACE MECHANISMS FOR THAT CONSTITUTION TO BE AMENDED BE IT THE DESIRE. WE COME FROM TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN YEARS WITH VERY FEW AMENDMENTS. MOST ALL OF BEEN VERY POSITIVE AMENDMENTS. IT SEEMS LIKE ALL OF A SUDDEN HERE IN AMERICA WE'RE ON A- GREAT RUSH. THE PURGE OUR HISTORY BECAUSE FROM BODIES PEARL DO NOT LIKE ELEMENTS OF OUR HISTORY. I DO NOT LIKE SOME ELEMENTS OF OUR HISTORY. BUT THIS COUNTRY HAS SURVIVED AND PROSPERED. FOR ALL OF THESE DECADES VERY WELL. AS AN EXAMPLE. TO THE WORLD. OF GOODNESS KINDNESS BENEVOLENCE RESPECT. DAVID CHERRY PICK ALL YOU WANT IS THE FINDING HERE DO. AND CONDEMN ALL YOU WANT. BUT I SUBMIT. OUR CONSTITUTION IS QUITE SOUND. AND THERE'S STILL ORDER THE SWELLED THROUGH THE DECADES AS HAS THE CALIFORNIA. CONSTITUTION. HERE WE CHANGE IT MORE OFTEN THAN NATIONALLY. AS WELL WE SHOULD I SUPPOSE. BUT I CAN'T ABIDE WITH THIRTEEN PAGES OF CHERRY PICKED EXAMPLES. OF WHAT SOME DETERMINAR BAD SOMEBODY'S I DETERMINAR BAD. BUT DO WE WANT TO REINVENT OUR HISTORY. FRANKLY ONE OF THE MOST NEGLECTED PARTS OF EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA IS HISTORY. OUR YOUTH ARE NOT IMBUED WITH A SENSE OF HISTORY. AND THIS HAS BEEN CONVEYED VERY OFTEN TO ME BY HISTORY PROFESSORS. AND TEACHERS. WE WANT TO REWRITE HISTORY. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE WAY TO DO IT. THEY WANT TO STAND UP FINE NOW TO THE ELEMENTS OF THE BILL. AT THE SAME ESTIMATED THE GOVERNOR MIGHT HAVE SOME PROBLEMS HERE BECAUSE IF YOU SEARCH THE GOVERNOR'S AUTHORITY. ALL THE GOVERNOR DOESN'T SEEM TO BE RELUCTANT TO USURP LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY THESE DAYS. BUT IT DOES IT GIVES JUST. IT THIRTY. THE ABILITY TO CONTROL OTHER AGENCIES. TO A BLANK CHECK THE BUDGETS OF OTHER AGENCIES. IN THIS AGENCY IS RECORDED ALMOST A BLANK CHECK IN THE BUDGET. I WILL BE UNKNOWABLE. SIR CALM WATER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND EITHER WAY WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR YOUR- M. AND I WANT I APPRECIATE THE- AUTHOR FOR- BRINGING THIS. BILL FORWARD I WANTED TO ASK I AM ACTUALLY HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR- ABOUT SORT OF THE COORDINATED INTEGRATED APPROACH- THAT THIS OFFICE WOULD HAVE I THINK OFTEN TIMES WHEN WE'RE THINKING ABOUT AND TALKING ABOUT RACIAL EQUITY- WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THE TOP LINE ISSUES CRIMINAL JUSTICE HEALTH CARE RACIAL VIOLENCE BUT WE'VE NOTICED AND WE KNOW THAT- THEIR RACIAL INEQUITIES THAT HAPPENED IN EDUCATION AND TRANSPORTATION AND NOW INFRASTRUCTURE DOLLARS ARE GIVEN OUT. IN A DEVELOPMENT CONSTRUCTION HOUSING X. SENTARA AND- IT WOULD BE. I THINK THE STATE WOULD BE REMISS TO HAVE AN OFFICE A NEWLY CREATED OFFICE THAT OPERATES IN A SILO- AND THAT ISN'T LOOKING TO SORT OF INTEGRATE IN INFUSE- EITHER THESE KINDS OF- METRICS OR QUESTIONS OR BENCHMARKS THAT WE SHOULD REALLY BE APPLYING ACROSS THE BOARD IN ALL OF THE AGENCIES THAT ARE RUN BY THE STATE. SO I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT AND THEN GIVEN THE FACT THAT THERE WILL BE A SUNSET WITH SEVEN YEARS AND I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO CURE AND THE CHALLENGES WITH OF RACIAL INEQUITY IN SEVEN YEARS. WHAT WOULD BE THE PLAN TO SORT OF- INTEGRATE YOU KNOW SO THAT IF IT DOES DISSOLVE THERE ARE STILL THE ELEMENTS OF THE OFFICE THAT ARE PERMEATING- YOU KNOW ACROSS ALL OF THE DEPARTMENTS. OF COURSE THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY I'M SURE EXTEND THE SUNSET BUT IF THAT WERE NOT TO HAPPEN HOW WOULD WE MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE STILL ABLE TO SAVE AND USE- AND EXPANDON THE WORK THAT WILL BE HAPPENING IN THIS OFFICE. I THINK YOU- CENTER CALLING FOR- FOR THE QUESTION- FIRST OF ALL- I THINK THE INTENT OF THE SUNSETS AS WORKING AS A IF I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH A CHAIR IS REALLY TO FOR- AND OPTING FOR REVIEW- TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE OFFICE SEE THERE'S ADJUSTMENTS WE NEED TO MAKE. TO THE LEGISLATION SOUNDING THIS OFFICE IN TERMS OF INSPECTORS MOVING FORWARD SO AT LEAST I CERTAINLY HOPE PERSONALLY THAT- THE PURPOSE OF THE SUNSET IS NOT TO TERMINATE THE OFFICE AT THAT TIME BUT TO IMPROVE IT AND AT NOW THAT WE HAD. THAT TIME LESSONS I DO APPRECIATE THE CHAIR WORKING WITH ME TO MAKE IT A SEVEN YEAR SUNSET TO GET SUFFICIENT TIME FOR THIS OFFICE TO. BE ABLE TO- LUNCH IT'S INITIAL WORK SUPPORTERS OPPORTUNITIES ENOUGH SO THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A GOOD VALUE AND GOOD EVALUATION BUT YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT GONNA SOLVE SYSTEMIC RACISM IN SEVEN YEARS- AND NOT ALL. DEAL PART IS YOU MEANT IS THAT- TO A OF EXAMPLE DO AN OFF OF. EQUITY AND THE HEALTH HUMAN. AND HEALTH EQUITY BUT AGAIN THE SILO IN ISSUE IS VERY IMPORTANT SO FOR EXAMPLE WE CAN THINK ABOUT CERTAIN HOUSING POLICIES THEN UNDERMINING- ACTUALLY WEALTH'S. CONTINUATION BY THAT BY- ACTUALLY BLACK AMERICANS AND OTHER. ANGEL GROUPS AS WELL THEN WHICH THEN HAS. CONSEQUENCES FOR. NOT ONLY ACTUALLY HEALTHY I CONSEQUENCES IT ALSO HAS OTHER TYPES OF CONSEQUENCES IN TERMS OF WELLS INTERLOCKING FINE AND SO FORTH SO THESE. POLICIES IN ONE SILO CAN HAVE TREMENDOUS IMPACTS IN OTHERS AND I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING IS BEEN RECOGNIZED BY PEOPLES- IS THE MANY LOCALITIES HAVE DECLARED RACE RACISM IS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AS SOMEONE WHO HAS A BACKGROUND PUBLIC HEALTH. WE KNOW THAT- OFTENTIMES. YEAH WE HAVE TO LOOK ACROSS THE SYSTEM THAT WHY CALL SYSTEMIC RACISM RAPE- BECAUSE AND OFTENTIMES AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS WE NEED TO BETTER BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND AND MEASURE IT. RIGHT AND IN MANY WAYS THIS OFFICE ONLY A FIRST STEP RIGHT THIS OFFICE GONNA LOOK AT TRADE ABOUT MEASURES. GET YOU'LL BE SITTING IN COULD. BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THE DATA AND THEN MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS AND THEN IT'S GOING TO BE OUR JOBS AS A LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR AND SO FORTH AND THEN TAKE THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS AND YOU KNOW ENACT THEM AND MOVE THEM FORWARD. RIGHT BUT IF YOU DON'T LOOK AT YOU DON'T DEFINE THE PROBLEM EXAMINE THE PROBLEM THE FIRST PLACE YOU CAN TAKE STEPS TO ADDRESS IT AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS OFFICE WHAT THIS BILL IS. ABOUT GETTING THAT FIRST STEP JUST LIKE IF YOU TRY IT YOU KNOW AND A PANDEMIC OR YOU SEE- WHAT HOW DO WE REDUCE SO IT'S A HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE OR ANY OTHER THINGS REPUBLICAN STANDPOINT FIRST THING YOU GOT TO DO IS- THAT IS ACTUALLY GATHERS THE DATA TO FIND A SOCIAL STRATEGY IN AND- OF COURSE GET THE POLITICAL WILL TO SOLVE IT AND I'M ACTUALLY QUITE ACTIVE PARAPHRASING AS SURGEON GENERAL JULIUS RICHMOND WHO WAS A MENTOR OF MINE. IN TERMS OF HOW TO ESTABLISH GOOD PUBLIC POLICY TO TRY TO. IMPROVE HEALTH SO- SO THANK YOU. SO MUCH FOR YOUR QUESTION. CENTER THANK YOU- BORDERS. THANK YOU. MAN POSE A QUESTION TO AUTHOR SURE THAT WOULD ACCEPT. WHAT IS THE ANTICIPATED COST FOR CREATING THIS COMMISSION. ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. SO WERE AT FIRST WELL I GUESS WE'RE WE'RE STILL WORKING THAT OUT ACTUALLY IS WE'RE HAVING DISCUSSIONS- ON THE BUDGET AS WELL AS- APPROPRIATIONS AND SO I SEE COMMISSION ITSELF- IS IN ITSELF- NOT TERRIBLY EXPENSIVE YEAH WE HAVE MANY WE DO HAVE OTHER CONDITIONS BUT I THINK THE REAL PART IS THE WORK TO BE ABLE TO DO THE DAY TO DATA ANALYSIS CERTAINLY OUR STATE COLLECTS A LOT OF DATA. IN FACT ACTUALLY A PREVIOUSLY OFF AND- OPEN DATA LOSS TO TRY TO MAKE THAT DATA MORE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC- BUT THEN WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE ANALYTICAL CAPACITY AS WELL AS WELL TO DO THAT AND SO- WE ARE- OF CONTINUING TO WORK ON THE- THE- THE FISCAL PART I'D REALIZING THAT THIS IS A- YOU KNOW A POLICY COMMITTEE DID DID NOT. HAVE THE ANALYSIS YET- TRUE AND PROCREATION AND CERTAINLY WORKING WHETHER THE CHAIR PROCREATION CENTER PORTANTINO WE WILL WORK OUT A MORE DETAILED US AT FISCAL ASSISTANCE TERMS OF WHAT THE COST WOULD BE FOR- THIS BILL. ABOUT BALLPARK FIGURE. WELL I THINK I INSTEAD OF TRYING TO SPEC. ON THAT- I THINK WHEN IT GETS YEN GOES. TO APPROPRIATIONS BUDGET WE CAN GET A MORE SPECIFIC I'M YOU CAN SCALE IT IN DIFFERENT SCALES ARE- IN TERMS OF- THE DEFIANCE OF THE QUESTIONS HOWHOW. WHAT DEGREE ARE WE- GOING TO SKATE AT WHAT SCALE ARE GOING TO DO THIS SO- I'M GONNA ASK A CENTER PORTANTINO TO COMMENT. BUT JUST FOR THAT FOR THOSE COMMITTEE MEMBERS A DON'T KNOW. THIS IS A COMMITTEE HEARING SO YOU'RE FREE. TO DIRECTOR COMMENTS TO- THE AUTHORED ANYTIME. WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THE CHAIR. SO- CENTER PORTANTINO YEAH I WAS JUST GONNA SAY SO WE HAVE NOT DONE A THE FULL COMMITTEE ANALYSIS BECAUSE THE BILL HASN'T LEFT THIS COMMITTEE YET BUT REST ASSURED WE WILL AND THAT'LL BE MADE AVAILABLE AND IS THE AUTHOR STATED TYPICALLY THESE ARE NOT SUPER EXPENSIVE- PROGRAMS BUT- I'M HAPPY ONCE THE ANALYSIS IS COMPLETE TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU SENATOR. BY ALL MEANS THANK YOU. I THINK THE- YOU SPEAK INTO THE MIKE PLEASE- SELF IMAGE OF MY OF MY LAST QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR. THIS OFFICE OF RICK RACIAL EQUITY WOULD. PUT FORWARD OR MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO BOTH THE EXECUTIVE AS WELL AS THE AS THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH'S POSSIBLY EVEN. THE ENTIRE BREADTH OF. DIVISIONS OF THE STATE IS THAT CORRECT. YES SEVEN MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH OF COURSE WOULD GO TO THE ABOUT THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE JUST LIKE MANY OTHER COMMISSIONS WOULD ALL RIGHT IN WITH IT. WITH THESE RECOMMENDATIONS BE LIMITED TO- PIECES OF LEGISLATION TO ENACT- POLICY WITHIN THE DIVISIONS OF THE STATE OR COULD THEY BE DIRECTED IT SEPARATELY TO REGULATORY BODIES THAT WOULD BY PASS THE LEGISLATURE. WELL I THINK THAT ANY REGULATORY BODY HAS TO WORK WITHIN THE CONSTRAINTS OF THE- THE CODE WHICH WE OF COURSE PASSES THE LEGISLATURE AND SO- IN MY EIGHT TIMES BODIES TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS AND THEN BETWEEN IT AND THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN NOT EXECUTIVE AND THE LEGISLATIVE- WE HAD A DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW WHAT WOULD WE DO WITH THE WITH THAT PARTICULAR RECOMMENDATION AND- OFTENTIMES WE WILL ACT AS THE LEGISLATURE TO. EITHER PUSH THE ADMINISTRATION TO DO SOMETHING OR EVEN LIMITED MINISTRATION FROM DOING SOMETHING WE DON'T AGREE WITH SO I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE NORMAL POLICY MAKING PROCESS. SO HERE ALL IN ALL FINISH HERE. ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE IS BECAUSE OF THIS HAS. EXPANSIVE JURISDICTIONAL AUTHORITY THAT REACHES TO ALL DIVISIONS POTENTIALLY OF THE STATE. AS WELL AS ALL THREE BRANCHES OF OUR GOVERNMENT. THAT THERE BE A FORMAL SYSTEM IN IT THIS WOULD ALL THIS BE LIKE A FRIENDLY I REQUEST FOR AMENDMENT. THAT AS THIS MOVES FORWARD TO APPROPRIATIONS. THAT IT BE AMENDED THAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS TAKE A FORMALITY MEANING THAT IN ONE DOCUMENT WETHERBY ON AN ANNUAL BASIS OR EVERY NUMBER OF YEARS ANY RECOMMENDATIONS BE CONSOLIDATED SO WE THEY CAN BE KEPT TRACK OF BECAUSE MY CONCERN IS THAT A COMMISSION LIKE THIS IS GOING TO SIPHON OUT. IN SELECT IN TARGETED WAYS OVER SEVEN YEAR PERIOD OF TIME AND WE'RE THE PUBLIC AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO KEEP TRACK OF EXACTLY WHAT THIS IS BEING- HOW THIS IS BEING CONDUCTED IN A WAY THAT IS HOLISTIC AND COMPREHENSIVE. SO I'LL LEAVE THAT UP TO YOU IF THAT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU THINK. COULD IMPROVE UPON. CERTAIN CERTAINLY THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSIONED- ISSUED ITS RECOMMENDATION SHOULD BE A MATTER OF PUBLIC RECORD AND- STUDENTS HAVE TO BE ORGANIZED IN A WAY THAT COULD BE EASILY REFERENCED BY OTHERS- THOUGH THE PUBLIC AS WELL AS COURSE- POLICYMAKERS AND- CERTAINLY WILL- TAKE THAT SUGGESTION TO HEART- WE'LL SEE WHETHER DEBT TO. BE THE PUT IN THE CODE BUT CERTAINLY HAPPY TO HAVE A DIALOGUE WITH YOU- THAT THAT BUT I WOULD IMAGINE ANY PUBLIC COMMISSION PUTTING THIS ONE SHOULD CERTAINLY MAKE ITS RECOMMENDATIONS. I REALLY AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AS WELL AS TO- THE LEGISLATURE AND INDEPENDENT ADMINISTRATION. AND SO I HEARKEN BACK TO WHAT- MY COLLEAGUES COMMENT. THAT I'M SUPER. I KNOW THE NEED IS THERE I KNOW THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ARE ENCOURAGING US TO LOOK AT THE QUALITY AND EQUITY RELATED ISSUES- I'M STILL A LITTLE HARD PRESSED TO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE. HAS THE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE CAPABLE OF ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE. ALREADY WITHOUT NECESSARILY CREATING A BRAND NEW COMMISSION- BECAUSE THIS IS THE ISSUE OF SILO. THINKING CAN EASILY BE OVERCOME BY AN INTER DISCIPLINARY DIRECTIVE FROM THE GOVERNOR WITHIN THE EXISTING DIVISIONS OF THE STATE RIGHT NOW THE- BUT THAT WAS THE SITE OF ON IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OKAY SO I'M YOU KNOW JUST MAKES- MY COMMENTS YOU KNOW I TOOK A LOOK AT THIS AND YOU KNOW THAT'S ONE OF THE JURISDICTIONS OF THIS COMMITTEE. IS WHEN WE SET UP NEW THINGS AND GOVERNMENT AGENTS AGENCIES COMMISSIONS AT CENTRE THEY FALL TO OUR COMMITTEE THIS THIS BILL WILL BE GOING TO THE JUDICIARY WHICH WILL BE DOING A DEEPER DIVE IN ISSUES LIKE THIS. AND FOR A FRANKLY I WAS MOVED BY THIS BILL ACTUALLY AS A RESULT OF THE FACT THAT- THE COST TO THE STATE IS SO LOW THE SITUATIONS IN OUR COUNTRY AND- I THINK EVEN IN OUR STATE. I THINK A MORE ACCESS TO MORE UNDERSTANDING OF- THE- THE RACIAL INEQUITIES OR DISCRIMINATION OR THE LIKE IN OUR- IN OUR GOVERNMENT IN OUR SOCIETY- ANY ATTENTION THAT WE CAN PUT TO THAT IN A POSITIVE MANNER. TO CHANGE THINGS THAT WE DO OR HOW WE ACT- YET ANY INDIVIDUAL DEPARTMENT TO BE BE MADE AWARE IT'S PROBABLY NOT PROBABLY IT'S A POTS THANK SO WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE DR PAN THANK YOU THANK YOU- CHAIR DOT AND- I SHOULD MENTION ALSO JUST- THAT. THERE'S AN ANNUAL REPORTING REQUIREMENT AND IN THE BILL ALREADY SO THAT'S- READY PART OF THE- THE BILL IN TERMS OF- BUT MONEY COMMISSIONS DUTIES IS TO DO ANNUAL REPORT- I WOULD ALSO DID THANK. THE MEMBERS TO THE SPOKEN ON THIS BILL I DO WAY TO. AT ADDRESS THE ISSUE IN TERMS OF- THEIR COUNTRIES HIS BECAUSE- I'M A L. A. I'M A OF IMMIGRANTS BUT I'M PROUD OF THIS COUNTRY AND THERE'S A REASON MY PARENTS CAME TO THIS COUNTRY GREAT. IN FACT OUR COUNTRY IS FOUNDED ON AN ASPIRATION NOW WE MAY FEEL THAT THE IN THE BEGINNING AND WE SELL A LONG WAYS TO GO BUT WE OUR ASPIRATION WAS EQUITY INTO FOUND THE OUR FOUNDING DOCUMENTS THE DECLARATION INDEPENDENCE AND- WELL COULD OF- MAJOR FOR ME THOMAS JESSICA WORDED A LITTLE BETTER TO ENSURE INCLUDE ONE AND THEY'LL TALK ABOUT. EQUITY AND EQUALITY IN OUR I WOULD MAKE THAT THAT OUR CONSTITUTION A DOCUMENT THAT CERTAINLY I HOLD VERY DEAR- THE PREAMBLE STARTS OFF WE THE PEOPLE THE UNITED STATES. IN ORDER TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION. ESTABLISH INSURED AND TRANQUILITY PROVIDE FOR THE COMMON DEFENSE PROMOTE THE GENERAL WELFARE. RIGHT AND SECURE THE BLESSINGS OF LIBERTY TO OURSELVES AND OUR POSTERITY DO ORDAIN AND ESTABLISH THE CONSTITUTION THAT STATES SO- YOU KNOW MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR SAID THAT THE MORAL ARC OF THE UNIVERSE BENDS TOWARDS JUSTICE. AS WE TALK ABOUT JUSTICE THAT'S IN THE PREAMBLE TO CONSTITUTION WE ALSO KNOW THAT UNFORTUNATELY THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN AUTOMATICALLY THAT HAPPENS ONLY RESULT OF EFFORT AND EVEN SACRIFICE. SO I WOULD DO THAT SB SEVENTEEN IS A- NOTHER STEP. IMPORTANT STEP BUT ATTENDED A STEP. TOWARD ACHIEVING THOSE ASPIRATIONS THAT IDEAL OF OUR COUNTRY THAT'S EMBODIED BOTH IN OUR IN OUR FOUNDING DOCUMENTS. AND THAT WE REALLY ARE ABOUT CREATING A MORE PERFECT UNION WHERE. EVERYONE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY HERE IN THE UNITED STATES IN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY. THAT WE CHIEF ACTITUD CHIEF EQUITY AND TO BUILD A PROSPEROUS HERE IN THIS GREAT COUNTRY BUT THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK PRIVATE.

THE FOUR SEVENTEEN YES SIR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SB FOUR SEVENTEEN ALLOWS HERE COMMON CARRIERS THE ABILITY TO TRACK IN ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES INTO THE STATE FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE LET ME JUST RESTATE THAT THE SOLE PURPOSE OF SERVING THAT ALCOHOL ON THEIR AIRPLANES WITHOUT THE NEED TO OBTAIN AN IMPORTER LICENSE. UNDER CURRENT LAW YOUR COMMON CARRIERS ALREADY ARE ALLOWED TO BRING IN ALCOHOL GET TO THE STATE FOR THAT PURPOSE WITHOUT THE NEED TO OBTAIN AN IMPORTER LICENSE HOWEVER CURRENT LAW REQUIRES THAT OUT THAT ALCOHOL TO BE BROUGHT IN ON THIS VERY SAME AIRPLANES. IN WHICH THE ALCOHOL IS SERVED. GIVEN THE LOGISTICAL COMPLEXITY OF AIR TRAVEL THIS GRIEF PROBLEMS FOR AIRLINES BECAUSE OF THE NEED. TO PLAY ON THE PATH OF ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES SO THAT ENDS UP ON THE CORRECT FLIGHT AT THE CORRECT PLACE AT THE CORRECT TIME WHEN IT WILL BE NEEDED. THIS BILL WILL SOLVE THAT ISSUE BY ALLOWING AIRLINES THE ABILITY TO TRACK IN ALCOHOL FROM OUT OF STATE. THAT'S IT ELSE'S POINTS OUT THOSE ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES WOULD ONLY BE ALLOWED TO BE SERVED ON THOSE AIR COMMON CARRIERS AIRPLANES IF THOSE ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES ARE USED FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE. THESE ARE LIFE WOULD BE A VIOLATION OF THE APC ACT. SUCH A VIOLATION WOULD RESULT IN THE DEPARTMENT OF A. B. C. HAVING THE AUTHORITY TO SEIZE THOSE ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES AND INDIVIDUALS SHOULD COULD BE. CHARGED WITH A MISDEMEANOR I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU. AND DO WE HAVE ANY OPPOSITE ANY SUPPORTERS HERE IN THE BUILDING I DO NOT SEE ANY. IN THE GALLERY DO WE HAVE ANY IN TWENTY FORTY. ANY OPPOSITION. YES THE SUPPORT SUPPORTERS ACCUSING. APPARENTLY NOT AND THAT SAID IT. TO THE MODERATOR DO YOU HAVE ANYONE IN QUEUE TO SUPPORT THE LEGISLATION. THAT COULD IDENTIFY THEMSELVES AND INDICATE THEIR SUPPORT. YES GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS BECAUSE KATE CAL ON BEHALF OF AMERICAN AIRLINE I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING CHAIRMAN DR HIS AUTHORSHIP OF THAT BEFORE SEVENTEEN WE GREATLY APPRECIATE HIS LEADERSHIP AND THAT HE MENTIONED UNDER CURRENT LAW AIRLINES NOT MOVING IMPORTED LIVE ALCOHOL THAT IS BROUGHT INTO ST PROPHETICALLY FOR YOU ON THEIR AIRCRAFT THE NARROWLY DEFINED LIMITED AMOUNT OF ALCOHOL AMERICAN AIRLINES BRINGS ABOUT THE WHOLE IN THE TYPE FIFTY FIVE LICENSEE.

THE END OF THE HERE EVERY IN. AIRLINE YOU NEED TYPE OF RETAIL EIGHT. AND THAT THEY ARE ALREADY REGULATED BY THE FEDERAL AGENCY THE FAA ADDITIONALLY UNLIKE MOST RETAIL AGENCIES THE IMPORTATION SALE AND OUR SERVICE OF ALCOHOL IS NOT THE PRIMARY BUSINESS OF THE AIRLINE. THE PRIMARY BUSINESS OF THE AIRLINE TRANSPORT PASSENGERS SAFELY. THE TOTAL VOLUME OF ALCOHOL DISTURBED IN THE AIRCRAFT IN CALIFORNIA IS NOMINAL AND ADDED THE TAX REVENUE GENERATED FROM THE INVENTORY IN FACT THE TAXES REMITTED ARE LESS ANNUALLY THAN THE LICENSING FEES AMERICAN PAID TO MAINTAIN THEIR TYPE FIFTY FIVE LICENSE. THE VAST MAJORITY OF ALCOHOL ORDERED IN SERVING CALIFORNIA IS FOR CLUB OPERATIONS AT THE AIRPORT. ALL ALCOHOL ORDERS FOR THE CLUBS WILL CONTINUE TO BE PLEASED WITH AND THE FILLED BY CALIFORNIA WHOLESALERS. FOR THE TAXIDERMY INTERVENE ON CHANGE BECAUSE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES FROM OTHER RETAIL LICENSEES THE AIRLINES ARE COMMONLY GRANTED STATUTORY. EXCEPTIONS AROUND THE COUNTRY. THESE EXCEPTIONS INTENDED TO GIVE THE AIRLINES FOR RELIGIOUS ISSUES. THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO THE L. SUPPLY. AND NOT TO CIRCUMVENT THE THREE THAT. WELL THE EARLY THERE FOR TO A- L. I THE AIR.

OF THE COMMITTEE ANYBODY WISHING- CENTER JONES. THANK YOU SHARE ANSWER GONZALEZ I HAD- JUST A QUICK QUESTION IT'S IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE- EFFORT MY DEEP MIGHT BE DUPLICATIVE- I DO APPRECIATE IN CONTRAST TO THE BILL I'M GOING TO MENTION I DO APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING IT THROUGH COMMITTEE- BECAUSE IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED SB EIGHTY FOUR. WHICH IS ACTUALLY BUDGET TRAILER BILL WHICH- THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED IN THE AND THE GOVERNOR AND GOVERNOR BROWN SIGNED THAT YOU KNOW PROBABLY DIDN'T I REMEMBER ALL THE DETAILS THAT BILL BUT IT PROBABLY DIDN'T COME TO COMMITTEE SUFFICIENT YOU. DOING THE- OPPER PROCESS- BUT- SB EIGHTY FOUR ESTABLISHED THE OFFICE OF STATEWIDE DIRECTOR OF IMMIGRATION INTEGRATION. TO SERVE AS A STATE WIDE LEAD FOR THE PLANNING AND COORDINATION OF IMMIGRANT SERVICES AND POLICIES. THE WORK OF THE OFFICE IS DESCRIBED AS QUOTE. I THINK THIS IS MIGHT BE FROM THEIR WEBSITE OR FROM THEIR CHARTER I'M EXACTLY SURE WE HELP IMPROVE ACCESS TO STATE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE DRIVERS LICENSES. COLLEGE ACCESS ADULT EDUCATION HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE TRAINING AND LEGAL SERVICES WE'RE ALSO EXPANDING SUPPORT FOR NATURALIZATION TO FULLY INTEGRATE IMMIGRANTS. AND SO THE QUESTION WOULD BE I GUESS IS YOU KNOW WHAT. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. THIS AND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH YES THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE QUESTION SENATOR JONES- THAT WAS UNDER THE GOVERNOR- THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION BACK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. AND IT YOUR IN FACT CORRECTED DID INCLUDE- A STATEWIDE DIRECTOR OF IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION HOWEVER- WITH THIS NEW ADMINISTRATION. THAT COULD BE IT'S NOW VACANT THIS DIRECTOR DOES NOT EXIST SO WE DON'T HAVE A DIRECTOR CURRENT. AND WE WANTED TO INCLUDE- REFUGEES IN THAT TITLE AS WELL AND ALSO EXPAND THAT TO NOT JUST IMMIGRANTS BUT REFUGEE SERVICES. SO THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW IS THAT IS ASKING FOR THIS OFFICE THIS AGENCY AND THEN YOU KNOW WHEN WE'RE ABLE TO APPOINTED THEY SHOULD PASS A DIRECTOR. THEY CAN THEN CREATE OFFICES THAT WILL WORK IN VARIOUS ARENAS EDUCATION SMALL BUSINESS AND ESPECIALLY AS MENTIONED WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ARE PRO ACTIVELY WORKING TO OFFER PATHWAYS TO CITIZENSHIP. ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR US I THINK YOU HAVE APPRECIATE THAT AND- RIGHT THE END PLACE TO DO REMAIN CONCERNED AND IT IS DUPLICATIVE IN THAT WE'RE ADDING ADDITIONAL GOVERNMENT- THERE'S A QUOTE FROM THE SECOND BE THEY DID EDITORIAL BACK I BELIEVE IN THE FALL REGARDING THE UP THIS UPCOMING LEGISLATION. LEGISLATIVE SEASON I'LL JUST READ THE QUOTE REAL QUICK FROM THERE OP ED CALIFORNIA HAS PIONEERED PRO IMMIGRANT LAWS. POLITICAL LEADERS AND ADVOCATES HAVE DEMANDED THAT CONGRESS OVERHAUL IMMIGRATION LAW. WHICH I AGREE WITH BUT IT ALSO- IF BUT IT'S ALSO IS THAT ISN'T FULLY AND ABA TO EXISTING AMERICANS. THE STATE'S PER PUPIL EDUCATION FUNDING IS AMONG THE LOWEST IN THE COUNTRY WHICH I DO DISAGREE WITH- WE HAVE A WE HAVE ESSENTIALLY THROWN OUT THE MASTER PLAN FOR PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION. AND WHILE HIKING THE COST OF PUBLIC COLLEGES WE CAN'T AFFORD TO MAINTAIN OUR FREEWAYS THE WAY THEY REQUIRE AND ARE SYSTEMATICALLY TURNING THEM INTO FREEWAYS. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT DISCUSSION FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE WHEN RETURNS IN JANUARY. BUT IT IS ONE THAT MUST TURN TO THE QUESTION OF FINANCIAL OBLIGATION SO THAT'S THAT'S THE KIND OF SUMS UP MY CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL. AND I DO I DO THINK YOU THOUGH FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND CONCERNS THANK YOU. DAUGHTER FRAZIER HANKS I CAN'T SAY I'M SORRY SUSAN- CENTER RUBIO EXCUSE ME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST I WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL AND BE ADDED AS A CLOT THERE WHEN APPROPRIATE.

EARS IS- THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS WITH OTHER AUTHORS FOR I THINK REALLY APPROPRIATE REASONS WE'VE EXTENDED THAT TO OTHERS FOR SEVEN HOURS I THINK IT'S ONLY FAIR TO WEEKS. TO EXTEND THAT EXTRA TWO YEARS TO SEE YOU AS WELL- JUST IN A MATTER OF FAIRNESS SO- WOULD YOU ACCEPT THE SEVENTY YEAR SUNSET AND WOULD YOU LIKE TO KEEP CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER TRACKER SHEET THAT AND YES I WILL ERTAINLY ACCEPT THAT AND- YOU KNOW AGAIN I JUST WANT TO SAY- THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE FOR. INDULGING US ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT MATTER- BUT AS WE'VE SEEN THROUGH COLD IT IN AS DR MONEY ONE POSSIBLE SAID VERY ELOQUENTLY- CODE NINETEEN SHOWED US THAT WE NEEDED MORE SUPPORT FOR AND AGAIN.
