AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT

00:58:12.889 --> 00:58:14.457
WE'RE STILL ANALYZING VERY

00:58:14.524 --> 00:58:16.226

01:02:16.732 --> 01:02:18.601
EITHER WAY LA THE WORK. SO IN

01:02:18.668 --> 01:02:20.703
KINGS COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE WE DID

01:02:20.770 --> 01:02:22.572
NOT HAVE ACOURT ORDER AT ALL.

01:02:22.638 --> 01:02:23.906
AND THEREFORE HAVE HAD NO

01:02:23.973 --> 01:02:26.642
BACKLOG WE'RE EXPERIENCING-

01:02:26.709 --> 01:02:28.578
INCREASING CASES FROM THE

01:02:28.644 --> 01:02:30.246
STANDPOINT THAT JUST BASED ON

01:02:30.313 --> 01:02:31.714
SERVICES BEING AVAILABLE AND

01:02:31.781 --> 01:02:33.449
BEING ASKED. ARE THERE MORE

01:02:33.516 --> 01:02:36.018
LIMITED- SO THEREFORE WE HAVE

01:02:36.085 --> 01:02:37.453
DELAYS IN REUNIFICATION AND

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:38.888
WHERE EVEN ON THAT AND WITH NO

01:02:38.955 --> 01:02:40.590
ACTUAL COURT IMPACT WE'RE

01:02:40.656 --> 01:02:42.225
SEEING CASES REMAINING IN THE

01:02:42.291 --> 01:02:45.228
I'M LONGER. AND I DO THINK

01:02:45.294 --> 01:02:46.529
THAT'S GOING TO BE ANY IMPACT

01:02:46.596 --> 01:02:48.564
STATEWIDE THAT. THAT WILL

01:02:48.631 --> 01:02:49.966
REALLY BE A SEPARATE ISSUE

01:02:50.032 --> 01:02:52.068
COMPARE TO COUNTY WHO HAVE HAD

01:02:52.135 --> 01:02:55.872
A CORD CLOSURE. IT AND

01:02:55.938 --> 01:02:56.939
THEREFORE NOT HAVE ALL DATA

01:02:57.006 --> 01:02:59.308
GALA TO CATCH UP ON THE BACK ON.

01:02:59.375 --> 01:03:00.943
YOU KNOW WHEN BRIEFLY. ON THE

01:03:01.010 --> 01:03:03.946
REFERRAL CALL AND HOTLINE CALLS

01:03:04.013 --> 01:03:04.981

01:03:05.047 --> 01:03:07.517
NOT EXPERIENCE A 50% DROP. IN

01:03:07.583 --> 01:03:11.154
THE 21% DROP. BUT THAT IS- WHEN

01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:13.022
WE CAN COMPARE MONTH TO MONTH-

01:03:13.089 --> 01:03:15.158
YEAR TO YEAR BECAUSE DURING

01:03:15.224 --> 01:03:17.360
SUMMER MOST COUNTIES EXPERIENCE

01:03:17.426 --> 01:03:18.794
THAT DECLINING CALL ANYWAY.

01:03:18.861 --> 01:03:21.297
THAT THOSE CALLS HAVE THAT DOES

01:03:21.364 --> 01:03:22.765
DROP OFF AND LEVELED OFF AND AS

01:03:22.832 --> 01:03:23.933
A MATTER OF FACT IN SEPTEMBER

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.735
AND OCTOBER WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN

01:03:25.801 --> 01:03:27.303

TECHNICALLY COMPLETED WE'RE

01:03:30.339 --> 01:03:32.008
SEEING AN INCREASE IN IMMEDIATE

01:03:32.074 --> 01:03:34.477
CALL WHICH THEN MR GREEN POINT

01:03:34.544 --> 01:03:36.012
BEING THE NEED FOR SOCIAL

01:03:36.078 --> 01:03:37.513

FAMILIES THAT WE SERVE I DO

01:15:23.785 --> 01:15:25.220
WANT TO CLARIFY THAT IN L. A.

01:15:25.287 --> 01:15:26.488
COUNTY THE COURT DID NOT

01:15:26.555 --> 01:15:30.525

01:15:30.592 --> 01:15:31.093
WE COMPLETELY CLOSED FOR TWO

01:15:31.159 --> 01:15:33.595
DAYS. RATHER WE HAD ONLY A

01:15:33.662 --> 01:15:35.931
VIRGIN SEE HEARINGS FOR. MOST

01:15:35.998 --> 01:15:37.633

SECOND. SO IS NOTA COMPLETE

01:15:40.702 --> 01:15:42.070
CLOSURE COURT WAS IN SESSION

01:15:42.137 --> 01:15:44.239
EVERY DAY IT WAS A REDUCED-

01:15:44.306 --> 01:15:46.174
COURT CALENDAR BECAUSE OF THE

01:15:46.241 --> 01:15:48.710
LACK OF TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE.

01:15:48.777 --> 01:15:50.445
AND BECAUSE WE COULD NOT. THEY

01:15:50.512 --> 01:15:51.880
ARE PRESIDING JUDGE DETERMINED

01:15:51.947 --> 01:15:53.415
THAT WE COULD NOT SAFELY HAVE

01:15:53.482 --> 01:15:55.651
IN PERSON HEARING SO THEY WERE

01:15:55.717 --> 01:15:56.251
EIGHT COURT ROOMS THAT WERE

01:15:56.318 --> 01:15:58.654
OUTSIDE WITH WEBEX IMMEDIATELY.

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:00.389
AND THOSE EIGHT COURTROOMS HELD

01:16:00.455 --> 01:16:02.791
HEARINGS EVERY DAY- AND THAT IS

01:16:02.858 --> 01:16:05.060
IN PART WHY WE SEE THE NUMBERS

01:16:05.127 --> 01:16:05.894
THAT WERE TALKED ABOUT IN TERMS

01:16:05.961 --> 01:16:07.562
OF MORE CASES OPENING THEN

01:16:07.629 --> 01:16:09.698
CLOSING. AREN'T TYPICALLY IN

01:16:09.765 --> 01:16:11.967
LOS ANGELES COUNTY. ABOUT SEVEN

HUNDRED CASES A MONTH CLOSE AND

01:16:13.302 --> 01:16:16.038
ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED CASES A

01:16:16.104 --> 01:16:17.472
MONTH OPEN. DURING MARCH APRIL

01:16:17.539 --> 01:16:19.875
MAY AND JUNE ALMOST NO CASES

01:16:19.942 --> 01:16:22.477
CLOSE. AND ABOUT THE SAME

01:16:22.544 --> 01:16:23.946
NUMBER FORTY FIVE HUNDRED

01:16:24.012 --> 01:16:25.614
OPENED- AS A RESULT AND AS

01:16:25.681 --> 01:16:27.282
YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD WE HAVE

01:16:27.349 --> 01:16:28.517
FOUR THOUSAND MORE CHILDREN. IN

01:16:28.583 --> 01:16:30.819
THE SYSTEM TODAY THAN WE DID-

01:16:30.886 --> 01:16:32.955
WHEN THE PANDEMIC STARTED. AND

01:16:33.021 --> 01:16:35.057
THE OTHER UNFORTUNATE IMPACT OF

01:16:35.123 --> 01:16:36.959
THE CLOSURES WAS THIS VERY

01:16:37.025 --> 01:16:38.894
SIGNIFICANT BACKLOG. AND THE

01:16:38.961 --> 01:16:39.928
FACT THAT THE COURT MADE A

01:16:39.995 --> 01:16:43.665
DECISION TO IMPOSE A SCHEDULE.

01:16:43.732 --> 01:16:45.467
FOR HEARINGS THAT PUT MANY MANY%

01:16:45.534 --> 01:16:46.935
HEARINGS ON THE WAY OUT INTO

01:16:47.002 --> 01:16:49.237
JANUARY FEBRUARY AND MARCH OF

01:16:49.304 --> 01:16:50.906
TWENTY TWENTY ONE- AND SO THAT

01:16:50.973 --> 01:16:52.975
BACKLOG IS NOT GOING TO BE

01:16:53.041 --> 01:16:55.410
COMPLETELY ELIMINATED- ANYTIME

01:16:55.477 --> 01:16:59.715
SOON AND THE IMPACT ON FAMILIES

01:16:59.781 --> 01:17:00.749
HAS BEEN PROFOUND. IT'S ALSO

01:17:00.816 --> 01:17:02.150
IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT IF

01:17:02.217 --> 01:17:04.152
THE CASE WAS SCHEDULED IN MARCH

01:17:04.219 --> 01:17:05.787
FOR A REVIEW HEARING OR HEARING

01:17:05.854 --> 01:17:07.556
WHERE PERHAPS A DECISION WAS

01:17:07.622 --> 01:17:08.790
GOING TO BE MADE ABOUT

01:17:08.857 --> 01:17:10.625
LIBERALIZING VISITATION OR

01:17:10.692 --> 01:17:12.661
CHILD GOING HOME OR TERMINATING

01:17:12.728 --> 01:17:13.929
REUNIFICATION BECAUSE THE

01:17:13.996 --> 01:17:15.097
FAMILY HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO

01:17:15.163 --> 01:17:16.798
WHAT THEY NEEDED TO DO AND

01:17:16.865 --> 01:17:18.400
MOVING INTO A PERMANENT PLAN.

01:17:18.467 --> 01:17:20.102
IF THAT CASE WAS CONTINUED FROM

01:17:20.168 --> 01:17:23.038
MARCH UNTIL. OCTOBER NOVEMBER

01:17:23.105 --> 01:17:25.040
DECEMBER JANUARY THAT FAMILY

01:17:25.107 --> 01:17:26.341
WAS THE LAST TIME THEY WERE IN

01:17:26.408 --> 01:17:29.578
COURT WAS IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY

01:17:29.644 --> 01:17:30.679
NINETEEN SO WE DO HAVE THERE

01:17:30.746 --> 01:17:31.813
ARE SIGNIFICANT ISSUES THERE

01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:33.281
THE COURT IS TRYING TO ADDRESS

01:17:33.348 --> 01:17:35.150
THEM I'M NOT SPEAKING ON BEHALF

01:17:35.217 --> 01:17:35.984
OF THE COURT I JUST WANTED TO

01:17:36.051 --> 01:17:39.921
CLARIFY- WHAT THE SITUATION HAS

01:17:39.988 --> 01:17:41.556
BEEN. COBIZ CERTAINLY ALTERED

01:17:41.623 --> 01:17:43.058
THE WAY THAT THE COURTS OPERATE

01:17:43.125 --> 01:17:44.693
MAGNIFYING SOCIAL AND CLASS

01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:46.061
BASED INEQUITIES AND SEVERELY

01:17:46.128 --> 01:17:47.929
IMPACTING ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND

01:17:47.996 --> 01:17:49.998
IMPEDING DUE PROCESS. WHILE

01:17:50.065 --> 01:17:51.033
SOME HAVE BENEFITTED FROM

01:17:56.638 --> 01:17:58.407
ELIMINATED. IN SOME USED TO

01:17:58.473 --> 01:17:59.508
MORE COMFORTABLE AND LESS

01:18:04.246 --> 01:18:05.814
OTHERS DO NOT HAVE RELIABLE

STATUS. LACK OF PARTICIPATION

01:18:17.225 --> 01:18:19.061
MAY BE INTERPRETED AS LACK OF

01:18:19.127 --> 01:18:20.862
INTEREST OR LACK OF COMMITMENT

01:18:20.929 --> 01:18:22.998

TECHNOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE AND

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:33.742
FAMILIARITY TO PARTICIPATE IN

COURT VIRTUALLY. OUR ATTORNEYS

01:18:35.744 --> 01:18:36.878
OFTEN HAVE TO SPEND A

CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME

01:18:38.213 --> 01:18:39.781

WEBEX. IF IT TAKES TOO LONG THE

01:18:47.556 --> 01:18:48.723
COURT MAY DECIDE THE WITNESS

01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:50.358
SHE TESTIFIED BY TELEPHONE

01:18:50.425 --> 01:18:51.960
WHICH RAISES OTHER ACCESS AND

01:18:52.027 --> 01:18:54.129
YOU CRISIS ISSUES. BUT

01:18:54.196 --> 01:18:55.030
UNFORTUNATELY HAPPENS QUITE

01:18:55.097 --> 01:18:56.598
FREQUENTLY. ADDITIONALLY

01:18:56.665 --> 01:18:58.733
OFTENTIMES PARTIES OR WITNESSES

TESTIFY BY TELEPHONE AGAIN

01:19:01.570 --> 01:19:02.671
BECAUSE PERHAPS IT'S LESS

01:19:02.737 --> 01:19:05.540
INTIMIDATING. BUT BUT THAT ALSO

01:19:05.607 --> 01:19:07.375
SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTS THE

01:19:07.442 --> 01:19:10.078
CREDIBILITY OF THE EVIDENCE AND

01:19:10.145 --> 01:19:10.612

DISRUPTED. DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW

01:20:03.231 --> 01:20:05.100
AND PROBLEMATIC. YOUR TESTIMONY

01:20:05.167 --> 01:20:07.202
OFTEN PRECLUDES NONVERBAL CUES

01:20:07.269 --> 01:20:08.637

01:20:26.888 --> 01:20:28.857
CHILDREN ESPECIALLY ALREADY

01:20:28.924 --> 01:20:29.958
FINE COURT HEARINGS TO BE

01:20:30.025 --> 01:20:31.393
CONFUSING WHEN THEY'RE ON THE

01:20:31.459 --> 01:20:33.361
PHONE OR VIRTUALLY IT IS IT IS

01:20:33.428 --> 01:20:34.596
THAT MUCH MORE CONFUSING AND

01:20:34.663 --> 01:20:36.097
HARD FOR THEM TO DISTINGUISH

01:20:36.164 --> 01:20:37.232
FOR EXAMPLE THE SOCIAL WORKERS

01:20:37.299 --> 01:20:40.202
SPACE FROM OTHER FACES ON THEIR

01:20:40.268 --> 01:20:41.970

BEYOND THE END OF THE PANDEMIC.

01:20:48.109 --> 01:20:48.877

01:20:58.787 --> 01:21:00.222
SOME ATTORNEYS ARE MAKING THEIR

01:21:00.288 --> 01:21:01.289
OFFICES AVAILABLE FOR THIS

01:21:01.356 --> 01:21:03.124
PURPOSE HOWEVER THIS IS NOT

01:21:03.191 --> 01:21:04.626
SUSTAINABLE IT WAS AN

01:21:04.693 --> 01:21:05.727
INAPPROPRIATE BURDEN ON THE

01:21:05.794 --> 01:21:07.729
ATTORNEY. ESSENTIALLY TO BUILD

01:21:07.796 --> 01:21:08.830
A VIRTUAL COURTHOUSE FOR THEIR

01:21:08.897 --> 01:21:09.764
CLIENTS THAT SHOULD BE THE

RESPONSIBILITY OF THE JUSTICE

01:21:12.767 --> 01:21:14.269
SYSTEM. ATTORNEYS LIKE SOCIAL

01:21:14.336 --> 01:21:15.337
WORKERS ARE UTILIZING

01:21:15.403 --> 01:21:16.771
TECHNOLOGY TO CONDUCT VIRTUAL

01:21:16.838 --> 01:21:18.039

TIME ENGAGING OR STAYING

01:21:25.447 --> 01:21:27.082
FOCUSED AGAIN THE LACK OF

PRIVACY IS A SIGNIFICANT

01:21:28.984 --> 01:21:31.753
CONCERN. ESPECIALLY CHALLENGING

01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:32.887

SERIOUS IN DEPTH CONVERSATIONS

01:21:34.923 --> 01:21:35.890
ABOUT ALLEGATIONS IN THE

TELEPHONE. AND FRANKLY I'M

01:21:43.231 --> 01:21:44.733
SORRY IT'S ALSO IN IN IT'S ALSO

01:21:44.799 --> 01:21:46.368
MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO BUILD

01:21:46.434 --> 01:21:47.502
RAPPORT WITH CHILDREN WHO HAVE

01:21:47.569 --> 01:21:49.304
BEEN LOST IN THE VIRTUAL WORLD.

01:21:49.371 --> 01:21:50.772
FRANKLY LIKE MOST OF US YOU

01:21:50.839 --> 01:21:52.073
THEY'RE ALSO TIRED OF TALKING

01:21:52.140 --> 01:21:53.208
TO PEOPLE ON THE PHONE OR

01:21:53.275 --> 01:21:54.209
VIRTUALLY AS THEY HAVE BEEN IN

01:21:54.276 --> 01:21:55.677
SCHOOL WE'RE TALKING TO

01:21:55.744 --> 01:21:57.412
THERAPISTS VIRTUALLY ARE ON

01:21:57.479 --> 01:21:58.580
ZERO ALL DAY LONG. IT'S

01:21:58.647 --> 01:22:00.148
DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO REMEMBER

01:22:00.215 --> 01:22:01.283
ALL OF THE ADULTS THAT ARE

01:22:01.349 --> 01:22:04.286
TALKING TO THEM ON THE PHONE OR

01:22:04.352 --> 01:22:06.321
VIDEO. CHILDREN'S ATTORNEYS AND

01:22:06.388 --> 01:22:07.656
THIS LEGISLATURE HAVE WORKED

01:22:07.722 --> 01:22:09.057
HARD TO ESTABLISH A STANDARD IN

01:22:09.124 --> 01:22:11.192
CALIFORNIA THAT VALUE VALUES

01:22:11.259 --> 01:22:12.160
THE IMPORTANCE OF CHILDREN

01:22:12.227 --> 01:22:13.728
HAVING MEANINGFUL PARTICIPATION

01:22:13.795 --> 01:22:15.463
IN THE COURT HEARINGS ARE LIFE

01:22:15.530 --> 01:22:17.365
CHANGING DECISIONS ARE MADE. IT

01:22:17.432 --> 01:22:18.733
HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT STEP

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:20.001
BACKWARDS RECORDS TO MAKE SO

01:22:20.068 --> 01:22:21.236
MANY DECISIONS WITHOUT THEIR

01:22:21.303 --> 01:22:23.605
PRESENCE. BEST PRACTICES

01:22:23.672 --> 01:22:25.473
REQUIRES SINCE EVER I NECESSARY

01:22:25.540 --> 01:22:27.342
SENSE OF URGENCY. BY ALLOWING

01:22:27.409 --> 01:22:28.710
CHILDREN TO LANGUISH WE'RE

01:22:28.777 --> 01:22:30.312
UNINTENTIONALLY CAUSING HARM TO

01:22:30.378 --> 01:22:32.380
CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. I ALSO

01:22:32.447 --> 01:22:34.582
WANT IN. RESPONSE TO A QUESTION

01:22:34.649 --> 01:22:36.017
AND A COMMENT FROM DR CANCEL

01:22:36.084 --> 01:22:37.585
THE EARLIER PANEL. WHERE HE

01:22:37.652 --> 01:22:39.220
ASKED ABOUT ESSENTIAL WORKERS

01:22:39.287 --> 01:22:41.222
AND THEIR ACCESS TO BP AND THEN

01:22:41.289 --> 01:22:42.424
THEIR FUTURE ACCESS TO

01:22:42.490 --> 01:22:43.992
VACCINES. INTERESTINGLY IN

01:22:44.059 --> 01:22:45.994
CALIFORNIA. ALTHOUGH ATTORNEYS

01:22:46.061 --> 01:22:47.529
INDEPENDENCY COURTS ARE

01:22:47.595 --> 01:22:48.797
CONSIDERED ESSENTIAL WORKERS

01:22:48.863 --> 01:22:50.498
BASED ON THE GOVERNOR'S ORDER.

01:22:50.565 --> 01:22:52.100
BECAUSE WE ARE FOR THE MOST

01:22:52.167 --> 01:22:53.435
PART NOT GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES

01:22:53.501 --> 01:22:54.736
WE DO NOT RECEIVE ANY OF THE

01:22:54.803 --> 01:22:55.737
BENEFITS OF THE PROGRAMS THAT

DISTRIBUTION OF THE VACCINES

01:23:06.114 --> 01:23:07.816
WHEN THEY OCCUR. JUST THE SAME

01:23:07.882 --> 01:23:09.284
AS THE COUNTY SOCIAL WORKERS

01:23:09.351 --> 01:23:10.652

CLIENTS EXPOSING THEMSELVES. TO

01:23:16.391 --> 01:23:18.893
KOBE- WHEN WE HAVE DETERMINED

01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:21.496
THAT. VIRTUAL CONVERSATION IS

01:23:21.563 --> 01:23:22.997
NOT ADEQUATE TO ENSURE CLIENT

01:23:23.064 --> 01:23:24.566
SAFETY WE ARE OUT IN THE

01:23:24.632 --> 01:23:26.234
COMMUNITY IN PEOPLE'S HOMES.

OUR ABILITY TO COPE WITH SAFETY

01:23:29.838 --> 01:23:31.606
PROCEDURES. BUT STILL PUTTING

01:23:31.673 --> 01:23:32.640
OURSELVES AT THE SAME LEVEL OF

01:23:32.707 --> 01:23:38.580
RISK. AS A COUNTY SOCIAL WORKER

01:23:38.646 --> 01:23:39.647
MIGHT. THE OTHER UP LAST THING

01:23:39.714 --> 01:23:41.282
I WOULD LIKE TO COME ON.

01:23:41.349 --> 01:23:42.617

CIRCUMSTANCES CHILDREN AND

01:23:55.330 --> 01:23:56.664
FAMILIES IN FOSTER CARE ARE

01:23:56.731 --> 01:23:58.466
CARRYING MORE OF THE BURDEN OF

01:23:58.533 --> 01:24:00.135

01:24:00.201 --> 01:24:01.703
OF US WHO ARE NOT IMPACTED BY

01:24:01.770 --> 01:24:03.638
THE DEPENDENCY COURTS AND WHAT

01:24:03.705 --> 01:24:05.140
I MEAN BY THAT IS I CAN MAKE

01:24:05.206 --> 01:24:06.674
THE CHOICE TO SPEND TIME WITH

01:24:06.741 --> 01:24:09.244
MY FAMILY I CAN DETERMINE AND-ASSESS THE ATTITUDE THAT THE

01:24:09.310 --> 01:24:10.412
LEVEL OF RISK THAT I THINK YOU

01:24:10.478 --> 01:24:11.479
SEE FOR APPROPRIATE FOR MY

01:24:11.546 --> 01:24:12.680
FAMILY BASED ON OUR HEALTH

01:24:12.747 --> 01:24:14.449
CONCERNS. I CAN MAKE A DECISION

01:24:14.516 --> 01:24:15.683
TO GO OUT INTO MY NEIGHBORHOOD

01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:18.653

01:24:22.524 --> 01:24:24.426
THE PARK WHAT WHATEVER IT MIGHT

01:24:24.492 --> 01:24:25.627
BE. BUT CHILDREN AND FAMILIES

01:24:25.693 --> 01:24:26.995
IN FOSTER CARE DO NOT HAVE THAT

01:24:27.061 --> 01:24:28.430
ABILITY TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS

01:24:28.496 --> 01:24:30.465
THEMSELVES. AND THE LACK OF

01:24:30.532 --> 01:24:32.667
PHYSICAL CONTACT. EVEN THOUGH

01:24:32.734 --> 01:24:34.536
VIRTUAL CONTACT IS BETTER THAN

01:24:34.602 --> 01:24:36.538
NOTHING IT DOES NOT REPLACE.

01:24:36.604 --> 01:24:38.339
THE ESSENTIAL PHYSICAL CONTACT

01:24:38.406 --> 01:24:39.808
ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG CHILDREN

01:24:39.874 --> 01:24:40.775
IN TERMS OF DEVELOPING

01:24:40.842 --> 01:24:42.744

SIMPLY GIVING A FAMILY MORE

01:24:53.254 --> 01:24:55.256
TIME TO RE UNIFY WILL NOT UNDO

01:24:55.323 --> 01:24:57.158
THE DAMAGE THAT IS DONE. WHEN A

01:24:57.225 --> 01:24:58.827
NEW MOTHER AND HER INFANT CHILD

01:24:58.893 --> 01:25:00.595

01:39:48.749 --> 01:39:50.551
THE CONFUSING PROCESS OF

MYSELF. AS AT THIS TIME WE WERE

01:39:55.189 --> 01:39:56.590
EXPERIENCING QUARANTINE. I HEAR

01:39:56.657 --> 01:39:57.691
FROM MANY USE THAT THERE'S A

01:39:57.758 --> 01:39:58.992
LACK OF COMMUNICATION COMING

01:39:59.059 --> 01:40:00.494
FROM SOCIAL WORKERS AT THIS

01:40:00.561 --> 01:40:01.962
TIME. IT IS ESPECIALLY

01:40:02.029 --> 01:40:03.263
INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING FOR

THE SYSTEM LIKE MYSELF. AT THIS

01:40:07.234 --> 01:40:08.502
POINT WE RECEIVE NEW WORKERS

WERE SUPPOSED TO HELP

01:40:09.903 --> 01:40:10.571
SUPPORTERS NAVIGATE THROUGH

NOT ALWAYS BE THE EASIEST FORM

01:40:19.446 --> 01:40:21.582

MY EDUCATION. UNIVERSITIES ARE

01:40:44.905 --> 01:40:45.906
NOT CORRECTLY TRAINING THEIR

01:40:48.909 --> 01:40:50.511
LITTLE TO NO INSTRUCTION NOW

01:40:50.577 --> 01:40:51.412

SCHOOL- MAYBE BECAUSE I KNOW

01:46:55.542 --> 01:46:57.744
SOME SCHOOLS ARE DOING IN

01:46:57.811 --> 01:46:59.646

VIRTUAL CONTACT WITH CLIENTS IS

01:50:07.567 --> 01:50:09.269
NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR IN PERSON

OF VIRTUAL. AND IN PERSON

01:50:29.456 --> 01:50:31.491
CONTACT ALTHOUGH CURRENTLY

BECAUSE OF THE INCREASED

01:50:33.126 --> 01:50:35.128
CASELOADS- BECAUSE OF THE

01:50:35.195 --> 01:50:36.663
BACKLOG AND INCREASED NUMBER OF

01:50:36.730 --> 01:50:38.631

THIS INCREASE CONTACT MORE

STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET

02:05:37.563 --> 02:05:39.131
BECAUSE THE FOSTER CARE CASES

02:05:39.198 --> 02:05:41.267
CLOSED EVEN LASSEN COURT

02:05:41.333 --> 02:05:42.835
AVAILABLE TO HER. THESE ARE

02:05:42.902 --> 02:05:45.137
JUST TWO OF HUNDREDS IF NOT

02:05:45.204 --> 02:05:46.272
THOUSANDS OF EXAMPLES OF THE

02:05:46.338 --> 02:05:47.806
CHALLENGES ARE CARE GIVERS ARE

02:05:47.873 --> 02:05:50.042
TRACING. THE STORIES ILLUSTRATE

02:05:50.109 --> 02:05:51.744
WHAT I THINK IS AN OBVIOUS

02:05:51.810 --> 02:05:54.179
POINT SUPPORTING CHILDREN AND

02:05:54.246 --> 02:05:56.081
YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE MEANS

02:05:56.148 --> 02:05:57.816
SUPPORTING THEIR CAREGIVERS.

02:05:57.883 --> 02:05:59.418
BUT I MAKE OBVIOUS STATEMENT

02:05:59.485 --> 02:06:00.853
BECAUSE TODAY THERE'S BEEN VERY

02:06:00.920 --> 02:06:03.022
LITTLE DIRECT SUPPORT PROVIDED

02:06:03.088 --> 02:06:03.856
TO ACCOUNT FOR THE DRAMATIC

02:06:03.923 --> 02:06:05.357
EXPANSION OF CARE GIVING

02:06:05.424 --> 02:06:06.492
RESPONSIBILITIES THAT KIND OF

02:06:06.558 --> 02:06:11.597
IT HAS. LAYER UPON OUR FAMILIES.

02:06:11.664 --> 02:06:12.731
THERE IS THERE BEEN A LOT

02:06:12.798 --> 02:06:15.334
DANGEROUS TO THE- BUT LITTLE

02:06:15.401 --> 02:06:16.135
ABOUT RESPOND HAS BEEN DRY

02:06:16.201 --> 02:06:17.536
SUPPORT PARK GIVERS. DESPITE

02:06:17.603 --> 02:06:18.771
THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE TAKEN

02:06:18.837 --> 02:06:19.571
ON THE BULK OF THE

02:06:19.638 --> 02:06:20.539
RESPONSIBILITIES THAT WERE

02:06:20.606 --> 02:06:22.041
PREVIOUSLY DIVIDED AMONG OUR

02:06:22.107 --> 02:06:25.577
SCHOOLS. BECAUSE PROVIDERS AND

02:06:25.644 --> 02:06:27.646
SOCIAL WORKERS. DESPITE OVER

02:06:27.713 --> 02:06:29.114
FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING

02:06:29.181 --> 02:06:30.382
TO SCHOOLS TO MITIGATE LEARNING

02:06:30.449 --> 02:06:32.017
LOSS MANY DISTRICTS ACROSS THE

02:06:32.084 --> 02:06:33.652
STATE ARE FAILING TO ACCOUNT

02:06:33.719 --> 02:06:34.586
FOR THE SPECIALIZED NEEDS OF

EVEN DURING HEARINGS ON PUBLIC

02:06:42.728 --> 02:06:43.963
HEALTH OFFICIALS HAVE ALLOWED

REFUSED TO OFFER ANY SMALL

02:06:48.634 --> 02:06:51.170
COHORTS. THE RESULT IS YOU TO A

02:06:51.236 --> 02:06:52.504
SPECIAL NEEDS ARE LANGUISHING

THEY HAVE NOT BEEN A RESPONSE

02:07:12.825 --> 02:07:14.193
TO THE ONGOING FINANCIAL AND

02:07:14.259 --> 02:07:16.295

THE END OF THE- TO EXTEND OUR-

IS WEIGHTED AND SCORED IN A WAY

02:08:09.148 --> 02:08:11.183

02:15:41.333 --> 02:15:43.335
THIS RIGHT WE'RE NOT DOING THIS

02:15:43.401 --> 02:15:44.870
FOR ANY OTHER REASON THAN JUST

02:15:44.936 --> 02:15:47.105
SIMPLY GIVE BACK. SO WE NEED TO

02:15:47.172 --> 02:15:51.877
DO BETTER CARING FOR CAREGIVERS.

02:15:51.943 --> 02:15:53.478
VISITATIONS THIS IS ONE OF THE

02:15:53.545 --> 02:15:54.746
BIGGEST ISSUESTHAT I'M HEARING

02:15:54.813 --> 02:15:56.147
FROM CARE GIVERS AND I'VE HEARD

02:15:56.214 --> 02:15:57.549
A LOT ABOUT VISITATIONS TODAY

02:15:57.616 --> 02:15:59.084
AND I DO AGREE WITH YOU THAT WE

02:15:59.150 --> 02:16:00.886
ALL WANT REDUCE RESEARCH- OF

02:16:00.952 --> 02:16:02.554
REUNIFICATION. THIS IS WHAT

02:16:02.621 --> 02:16:04.589
WE'RE HERE FOR RIGHT TO BLAME

02:16:04.656 --> 02:16:05.757

BE A GUARDIAN BUT I GOT A

02:16:12.197 --> 02:16:14.032
GUARDIANSHIP OF TWO. BUT WHEN

THERE'S NO ONE ELSE WE'RE HERE.

02:16:16.001 --> 02:16:17.269
BUT WHEN THERE IS FAMILY OUR

02:16:17.335 --> 02:16:19.671
GOAL IS TO REUNIFY BUT NOT AT

02:16:19.738 --> 02:16:21.873
THE RISK OF THE CARE GIVERS AND

TO BE AVAILABLE. FOR CHILDREN

SIX TO TWELVE YEARS OLD. SO THE

02:22:59.737 --> 02:23:01.205
TIMING WAS. BECAUSE OF COVERAGE

02:23:01.272 --> 02:23:03.408
