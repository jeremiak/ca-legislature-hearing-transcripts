THEY ASK QUESTIONS AFTER EVERY PANEL HE HAD BEEN IN NOT AFTER EVERY WITNESS I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS FOR SPECIFIC WITNESS PLEASE JUST WAIT TILL THE ENTIRE PALES SPOKEN SPEAKING OF WITNESSES LET ME THANK ALL OF YOU IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR TIME SIR ALAN I BELIEVE YOU HAVE A FEW WORDS. I WANT TO THANK YOU MR CHAIR THIRTY CENTER DIED AND I WANT TO THANK THE GEO STAFF. ARE FOR YOUR DEDICATED WORK ON THIS ISSUE I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR PUTTING TOGETHER THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING- ON DIRECT TO CONSUMER SHIPPING. I HAVE DISTILLED SPIRITS AND BEER WHICH WAS AS YOU MENTION THE FOCUS OF OUR EFFORTS EARLIER THIS YEAR S. BE SIX TWENTY A BILL THIS- GOING TO BE BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE AND- IN THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS. I'M IN ONE OF THE DISTRICT'S BEEN TERRIBLE PANDEMIC AS WE ALL KNOW BUT ONE OF THE SILVER LININGS. I HAS BEEN THE DEVELOPMENT OF CREATIVE POLICY IDEAS SPURRED BY THE NEED TO ADJUST TO LIFE UNDER CODE RESTRICTIONS. SINCE AN HOUR IN A SITUATION WHERE TEN STATES IN THE COUNTRY AND THE AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA ALLOW DIRECT TO CONSUMER SHIPPING FOR BEER. AND DISTILLED SPIRITS. HI DURING THE PANDEMIC ADDITIONAL STATES ALLOWED OFF THE WHOLE PRODUCERS TO SHIP DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS AS A TEMPORARY ECONOMIC RELIEF MEASURE- AS FOLKS HERE KNOW IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY JUST LAST YEAR GOVERNOR NEWSOM DIRECTED. OUT DIFFERENT ALCOHOL BEVERAGE CONTROL ALLOW DIRECT CONSUMER SIPPING A BEER AND SPIRITS. THIS IS ONE OF SEVERAL POLICIES WERE PUT IN PLACE TO RESPOND TO CONSUMER DEMAND. IN THE SOCIALLY DISTANT ECONOMY. HOW THE STATE NOT INTERVENED AND ALLOWED FOR TEMPORARY ABILITY. FOR DIRECT CONSUMER SHIPPING. IN THOSE CASES MANY LOCAL DISTILLERIES AND BREWERIES- WOULD'VE LIKELY BEEN FORCED TO SHUT DOWN PERMANENTLY. SO NOW IT'S MY SENSE YOU KNOW JUST IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE'VE NOW SEEN THE BENEFITS OF ALFRESCO DINING AND ONE I HOPE TO ENCOURAGE CITIES TO ENCOURAGE TO CONTINUE THAT PRACTICE. WE'VE GOT THE OPPORTUNITY NOW TO SUPPORT THESE CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES BY CREATING A BETTER SYSTEM WHILE INCREASING CONVENIENCE AND SAFETY. FOR CUSTOMERS. ALREADY UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW BOTH IN STATE NOT A STATE WINE GROWERS ARE ALLOWED TO SELL AND SHIP WINE DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS. WE'VE SEEN THE DIRECT TO CONSUMER MODEL WORK EFFECTIVELY IN THE WINE MARKET NINE OTHER STATES IN CALIFORNIA THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC AND WE KNOW IT'S WHAT CONSUMERS WANT. I'LL GIVE YOU A PERSONAL STORY I GOT MARRIED. SATURNO HEIAU. UNDERDOG IS A STORY BUT- WE GOT MARRIED IN A WONDERFUL PART OF OHIO- THAT- IS FAMOUS FOR ITS MOONSHINE. AND FOUND A WONDERFUL LOCAL DISTILLER WHO WANTED TO I WAS GONNA SERVE AT OUR WEDDING AND TELL FOLKS ABOUT. HIS DISTILLERY IN ALL OF HIS WORK AND- THE CRAZY THING IS AND HE BEAMED LIVE JUST DOWN THE ROAD FROM THE PLACE WHERE WE GOT MARRIED- I WASN'T ABLE TO BUY IT DIRECTLY FROM HIM WE HAD TO GO TOGETHER TO THE LOCAL KROGER. TO BUY BOTTLES OF HIS- OF HIS- PRODUCT. HI JUST SO SWEET TO BE ABLE TO SERVE AT THE WEDDING WHICH IS JUST SO RIDICULOUS BECAUSE HE HAD A- YOU KNOW A FIVE. OF IT LIKE A ROOM FULL OF FOR THE PRODUCT RIGHT THERE IT IS THAT IS OFFICE THAT HE WAS HAPPY TO SELL TO ME BUT IT BECAUSE HE WASN'T ALLOWED TO BECAUSE- HI I HAVE SIMILAR LAWS TO WHAT WE HAVE AND IT GOT ME THINKING A LOT. ABOUT HOW WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE THINGS BETTER FOR CONSUMERS. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM INDUSTRY LEADERS TODAY TO LEARN MORE ABOUT DIRECT CONSUMERS SHIPPING HOW WE CAN BUILD ON THE TEMPORARY PANDEMIC MODEL TO MAKE IT AN EVERYDAY REALITY. I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN MR KERR FOR BEING HERE MY COLLEAGUES. FOR BEING HERE AS WELL. FOR FURTHER WAYS OF THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY ANYTHING BEFORE WE START VERY MUCH- OKAY WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM OUR FIRST RESENTER. IT'S MATTHEW- BODY. BODY HE'S THE GENERAL COUNSEL OF THE DEPARTMENT ABC. MR BONDING- YOU CAN BEGIN SIR. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WHEN HE DOES APOLOGIZE AND- BUT I'M ON A TRAIN BUT ONCE WE GOT THE ON THE- BIKE GOOD AFTERNOON THE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANKS FOR HAVING THE EFFECT. GOD MY NAME IS MATTHEW VAUGHN AND I AM THE GENERAL COUNSEL WITH THE THING. THAT ARE GOING. TO COME OUT PUBLICLY HELLO. DURING MY MORE THAN YEARS REGULAR OUT. OR AND- YUP. TO BECOME FAMILIAR WITH MANY OF THE ISSUES SURROUNDING THE SHIPPING ABOUT PUBLIC RECORDS. ON MANUFACTURED CROSS STATE LINES. I SPOKE WITH REGULATORS FROM ANY OTHER STATES AS WELL AS INDUSTRY AND SHIPPING COMPANY REPRESENTATIVES. THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY COMPLEX AREA OF LAW AND ALCOHOL RECOVERY BUT MANY COMPETING INTERESTS STRUGGLING TO BALANCE THE DEVICE WITH THE INDUSTRY TO EXPAND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES. AND THE NEED FOR PUBLIC POLICY TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY CALIFORNIA HAVE THEIR REGULATORY STRUCTURES CHALLENGED THE BILLBOARDS. BASED ON CONSTITUTIONAL OKAY COMMENTS GROUNDS. THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT HAD SPOKEN DIRECTLY ON THE ISSUE OF SHIPPING OUT THE HOPE YOU CREATE YOUR CROPS THEY WANT. HELP IF THEY NEED TO SHOW THAT RESTRICTIONS ON OUT OF STATE THAT. BUT THEY'RE NOT A FLIGHT INSPECT THE AND- SUPPORTED BY JUSTIFY. MAY TO ADVANCE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE LEGITIMATE NON DISCRIMINATORY REASONS. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THE END OF THE ISSUES INVOLVED A VERY COMPLEX. MANY THOUGHT. MY GOAL TODAY IS TO SIMPLY SUMMARIZE WHAT IS PERMITTED ON THE STRIP AND CALIFORNIA LAW. SHIPPING AND DELIVERY ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES. THANK YOU BYE BYE. AND STATE AND OUT OF STATE. YEAH CALIFORNIA REGULATES THE ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE INDUSTRY- FOR MODIFIED IT SUCKED UP. AND IT'S NOT SIMPLE FORM OF ANY TRUST LAW DEFINES THE SEPARATE MANUFACTURERS DISTRIBUTORS AND RETAILERS ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES. IN A COMMERCIAL STRUCTURE OF MEDICAL RECORDS THAT'S NOT PRIVILEGED TO SELL ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES PRODUCT AGREEMENT. MANY DECADES BUT PROHIBITION THE LEGISLATURE HAS EXPANDED THE PRIVILEGES OF MANUFACTURERS TO INCLUDE AMONG OTHER THINGS THE ABILITY TO SELL ALCOHOL THEY PRODUCE PRODUCT BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT. UNTIL THE UNITED STATES COURT ISSUED A THE COLLISION ON THE GRASS HOME FIELD EXAMS WITHOUT PART. IS WIDELY UNDERSTOOD BUT UNCLAIMED MANUFACTURED COULD BE AFFORDED MORE PRIVILEGES THAT'S RESPECT OUT OF SPEC AT BERKSHIRE. I WOULD TO THE COURT COME OUT OF THE TWENTY FOUR AND THEN WE AND THE PHONE PROMISE BOOKS. OUT OF THIRTY NINE AFTER MUSTARD BE A- FOR PRIVILEGE. I DIDN'T THINK MY. I'M TO SELLING AND DELIVER ALCOHOL BEVERAGES. THIS PREVENTS MANY LEGAL REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT AND TAX. LOCAL LOCAL LOCAL MANUFACTURERS HAVE BEEN POLITICAL DIRECT TO CONSUMER ACCESS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN WINERIES BREWERIES AND DISTILLERIES AND CREATE SOME OF THE DELIVERY CODE WHICH IS THE CLEARLY STATED. ON ALL OF THOSE- PART. CALIFORNIA WINERIES SO MANY YEARS AT THE CLUB WITH A SELL DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS FEEL BOTTLES OF WINE PER QUANDARY PRODUCERS WILL HAVE YOUR SUPPORT COMPLY THE NUMBER STILL GONNA WINERY COULD ALSO. DID YOU KNOW THE WAY FROM APPLY. AND THROUGHOUT FIVE FOLLOWING THE SUPREME COURT DECISION A LITTLE LATER THE QUESTION CARDS SECTION THREE THIRTY SIX ONE POINT. THREE CREATING A WIND DIRECTION INFORMATION AND OTHER ONE- IT'S QUANTITIES CAUGHT WIND. HELLO I COULD NOT BE LABELED AS CONTAINING ALCOHOL AND THE MANUFACTURER MUST REQUIRE THE DELIVERY PERSON TO OBTAIN A SIGNATURE LOOK YEAH TWENTY ONE. BUT ALL OF OUR- IN ADDITION OUT OF STATE WINERIES MUST PAY ALL APPLICABLE CALIFORNIA TRACKS. IN SOME RESPECTS THE CREATIVE SITUATIONS IN WHICH OUT OF STATE WINERIES AND MULTIPLE DISCIPLINES LIKE WALK. FOR EXAMPLE A WINERIES MAY ONLY SELL ONE THEY PRODUCE THEMSELVES OR THAT PRODUCE FOR THEM ON THE LINE FOR YOUNG. NO SOONER THAT PRESCRIPTION IT LOOKS LIKE OUT OF STATE ONE. IN ADDITION THE OUT OF STATE WINERIES DO NOT NECESSARILY HAVE TO SATISFY THE SAME QUIET. WE CAN QUALIFY A PARK. SO THIS MEANS OUT OF STATE BUSINESSES MAY BE ABLE TO SELL ON THE LEVEL ONE FOR HELLO ON THE COMPUTER. EVEN ON AN INSPECTOR OPERATING IN THE SAME MANNER. WOULD NOT BECOME A CRITICAL. WHILE CALIFORNIA BREWERIES AT THE PRIVILEGE TO TELL OCCUR SOME. TO CONTINUE THE CONSUMPTION. THE LIGHTNING. J. B.

REVIEW YOUR YOUR TESTIMONY PLEASE. GOING UP THE CHAIRLIFT AND GET THOSE OVER TO YOU RIGHT AWAY. THANK YOU SIR. OKAY WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO TAKE MR TIM SCHMELZER- WITH THE- WINE INSTITUTE THE SMELTER THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. PLEASED TO BE HERE- CHURN MEMBERS AND- REALLY- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY- I WAS ASKED TO KIND OF SHARE WITH THE EXPERIENCES. OF CALIFORNIA WINERIES WITH REGARD TO OUR PRIVILEGE OF BEING ABLE TO SHIP DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS- AS AS I KNOW YOUR PARTICULAR WHERE- GERMAN DIED- OUR INDUSTRY IS IT IS PROBABLY AN INTEGRAL PART OF. CALIFORNIA'S CULTURAL FABRIC STANDS. THE DIRECT TO CONSUMER PRIVILEGE IS A VITAL PART OF CALIFORNIA'S WINE BUSINESS AND IS A COMPLIMENT TO OUR TRADITIONAL RETAIL CHANNELS. DIRECT TO CONSUMER SHOULD BEING ALLOWS CALIFORNIA WINERIES AND OTHER WONDERS OF COURSE TO MAINTAIN A PERSONAL CONNECTION WITH OUR CUSTOMERS BY PROVIDING THEM A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE ARE YOU PROBABLY NOTED THAT- IF YOU EVER VISIT A WINERY THAT NEARLY EVERY WINERY HOUSE OF WINE CLUB. ADD THIS WINE CLUBS ARE- THROUGH THIS PRIVILEGE ABLE TO SHIP UNIQUE BOTTLINGS TO THEIR CUSTOMERS ON A SUBSCRIPTION BASIS THIS IS OFTEN THE BREAD AND BUTTER- OF REVENUE FOR- IN PARTICULAR THE SMALLER WONDERS- WINERIES. ARE HAVE A STRONG EMPHASIS ON HOSPITALITY ALMOST ALL WINERIES ARE LOCATED IN. A COLLEGE SETTING SURROUNDED BY VINEYARDS AND HAVE THESE BEAUTIFUL TASTING ROOMS. AND BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE THIS UNIQUE EXPERIENCE DIRECTLY TO CONSUMER'S STORES REALLY HELPS FOSTER- THAT PERSONAL CONNECTION WE HAVE WITH OUR CUSTOMERS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT REALLY MAKES DIRECT TO CONSUMER WORK IS ITS COMPLEMENT TO WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO PUT IN A RETAIL CHANNELS. WINERIES ARE ABLE TO MAKE DIFFERENT STYLES OF WINE- EVERY YEAR IN ORDER TO PROVIDE UNIQUE SMALL BATCH. WINES FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS- THAT THEY TYPICALLY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GET IN THE GROCERY STORE OR OR OTHER PLACES ALLOWS OUR WINEMAKERS TO REALLY LEAD INTO THE ARTISTRY OF WINE MAKING AND THEY CAN CREATE UNIQUE BLENDS. I AM DIFFERENT- BRIDLES AND MIXING BLENDING DIFFERENT VARIETALS AS WELL AS A FIND DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES SUCH AS BARREL AGING YOU SERVE DIFFERENT USE SENATE CETERA TO PROVIDE. UNIQUE EXPERIENCES FOR THE CUSTOMER AND THIS IS WHAT REALLY FUELS OUR CUSTOMERS DESIRE TO HAVE WIND SHIFT DIRECTLY IT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY WOULDN'T OTHERWISE BE ABLE TO GET. NO DOUBT ALSO BE ABLE TO PRODUCE THESE ARE SMALL BATCH WINES WITH THE HIGH FOCUS ON PREMIUM QUALITY HAS REALLY LED TO- AN OVERALL IMPROVEMENT IN THE QUALITY OF WINES SICK- CALIFORNIA WINERIES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PRODUCE OVER THE YEARS- BETTER STILL ONLY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT EVERY SEGMENT OF OUR- INDUSTRY BENEFITS FROM. THE DIRECT TO CONSUMER- WHITE PRIVILEGE EVEN THOUGH IT'S NORMALLY ASSOCIATED JUST WITH SMALL WIRES. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT MEANS TO CONNECT WITH CUSTOMERS AND MAKE A PERSONAL CONNECTION EVEN FOR OUR OUR LARGEST WINERIES. AND ALLOWS THEIR THEIR WINE MAKERS JUST AS WELL AS SMALL WINE- WINERY WINEMAKERS. PRODUCE UNIQUE BOTTLE IT'S- M. FOR SMALL WINERIES I AM FRANKLY DIRECT TO CONSUMER IT IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO THEIR SURVIVAL. WELL OVER 90% OF CALIFORNIA'S FOUR THOUSAND WINERIES ARE EXTREMELY SMALL AND SHE MORE OR LESS TOTALLY DEPENDENT ON DIRECT TO CONSUMER SALES. WHETHER THIS IS OUT THERE TASTING ROOMS OR BY SHIFTING DIRECTLY TO THE CONSUMERS STORE. IN FACT THIS DIRECT TO CONSUMER PRIVILEGE HAS REALLY FOSTERED THE GROWTH OF SMALL BOUTIQUE WINERIES IN CALIFORNIA AFTER THE LANDMARK TWO THOUSAND FIVE GRAND HOME SEASON. THE THIS SEGMENT OF THE WINE INDUSTRY CALIFORNIA HAS HAS LITERALLY EXPLODED TO THE POINT- LIKE I MENTONED WE HAVE ALMOST FOUR THOUSAND WINERIES IN CALIFORNIA. ARE ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE ON AND IT'S- BUT I THINK SENATOR ALLEN BROUGHT THIS UP- THIS ABILITY TO SHIP DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS- WAS A VITAL LIFELINE FOR SMALL LINERS TO SURVIVE DURING THAT. ACADEMIC THEY'D LITERALLY WHATEVER HI JUST IT WOULD HAVE BEEN UGLY OUT THERE MANY WINERIES WHAT ABOUT TO SHUT SHUT THEIR DOORS- BUT FOR THE STABILITY AND IT REALLY. I JUST CAN'T EMPHASIZE HOW IMPORTANT THAT WAS TO THEIR SURVIVAL. DURING DURING THESE DIFFICULT TIMES- IT ALSO- CREATED SHOULD LEAD TO SOME NEW CREATIVE APPROACHES TO SELLING WINE- THAT AGAIN LIKE CINDERELLA MENTIONED I GUESS- NOW IT IS VERY COMMON FOR WINERIES OFFER VIRTUAL WINE TASTINGS. FOR EXAMPLE WHERE YOU HAVE ONE SHIPPED DIRECTLY TO CONSUMER THEY WILL GET ONLINE MUCH LIKE WE ARE TODAY AND THE- WINEMAKER OR PERHAPS TO GET SOME OF THE ACTION WALK THEM THROUGH- THE TASTINGS AND GIVE THEM- EXPERIENCE VERY SIMILAR TO BEING ABLE TO VISIT THE WIND. BY WINERY DIRECTLY. ALSO I WAS ASKED TO SPEAK LITTLE BIT AS TO THE LOGISTICS ABOUT HOW DIRECT TO CONSUMER- WHEN SHIPPING WORKS FOR WINERIES. FOR MOST WINERIES% THE NORMAL APPROACH IS TO USE- TO HANDLE THIS PRIVILEGE THROUGH THE USE OF TWO DIFFERENT- TYPES OF THIRD PARTY COMPANIES. THE FIRST IS ESSENTIALLY A COMPLIANCE COMPANY THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING APPROPRIATE LICENSES- ARE IN PLACE AND TAXES ARE ARE COLLECTED- CAUSES I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE THERE IS ABSOLUTELY ABHORRENT OF. WINE SHIPPING LAWS ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT MUST BE NAVIGATED. FRANKLY BEYOND THE ABILITY OF MOST SMALL WINERIES TO DO THAT THEMSELVES- AND IT'S FOR EXACTLY THAT REASON THAT THESE ARE COMPANIES EXIST. AND ALSO OF COURSE TAX RATES BERRY- YOU KNOW NOT ONLY IN OBVIOUSLY CALIFORNIA- JURISDICTIONS BUT ALSO ACROSS THE COUNTRY WE TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY- OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO COLLECT THE APPROPRIATE TAXES AND THE USE OF THESE TOP INSULTS INSURE. THAT APPROPRIATE TAXES ARE COLLECTED AND REMITTED TO THE PROPER AUTHORITIES. AND THEN- THE OTHER PROBABLYWOULD ALREADY GUESSED BUT- FULFILLMENT CENTER SO MOST WINERIES- USE ONE OF TWO LARGE FULFILLMENT- COMPANIES- THAT ARE LOCATED IN THE STATE. AND WHEN YOU HAVE A WIDE ORDER IT'S USUALLY- THAT COMPANIES HOUSE WRIST IS STORING PRODUCT FROM THE WINERIES AND CANDLES. ARE ACTUALLY PACKING AND SHOULD BE IN THAT WIND- TRUE THE CONSUMER AND THAT'S A COUPLE. MOMENT SECTORS. AND THEN- FOR. I WAS ASKED SPEAK A LITTLE ABOUT TWO BE. BALL OF WINE TALKING ABOUT OR WHAT WHAT PERCENTAGES OF THE INDUSTRY. AND THE NUMBERS ACTUALLY QUITE QUITE SMALL AND- IN REGARDS TO THE OVERALL- BUYING SALES. DIRECT TO CONSUMER- SHIPPING- WINE AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL ONE THAT ENTERS THE MARKET PLACE IS ONLY TWO POINT 2% OF THE STOCK ACTUALLY RELATIVELY SMALL. BUT YOU ALSO HAVE TO PUT THAT IN CONTEXT IS THE LIFEBLOOD OF WELL OVER 90% OF A VERY VERY SMALL AND- WINERIES THAT THEMSELVES ACCOUNT FOR JUST A SMALL AMOUNT OF THE MARKETPLACE- TO PUT A REAL NOW. TWO FOR YOU- CALIFORNIA- SHIPMENTS ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT 77% OF THE TOTAL U. S. DIRECT TO CONSUMER MARKET. AND THAT COMES OUT TO ABOUT FIVE MILLION CASES OF CALIFORNIA WINE THAT IS SHIPPED DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS- INTERESTINGLY WITH THAT- TWO POINT TWO. PERCENT NUMBER- IT ACTUALLY ACCOUNTS THAT'S PUT INTO CONSUMER CHANNELS AND THIS REALLY REFLECTS THAT UP PARTICIPANTS IN THE H. R. DIRECT TO CONSUMER- MARKETS ARE SEEKING A UNIQUE AN OP AND- PREMIUM WINE EXPERIENCE SO- FOR THE MOST PART- THESE ARE FOLKS THAT ARE INTERESTED IN YOU KNOW YOU NEED. A HIGH END BOTTLES OF WINE EACH OTHER THIS NOTABLY- DURING THE PANDEMIC YOUR- THERE'S BEEN SOME RELATIVELY SEISMIC SHIFTS. IT NOT MARKET OUR OUR CONSUMERS ARE FINE WITH THAT FINDING THAT DIRECT TO CONSUMER MAYBE THE ONLY MANNER IN WHICH THEY CAN- THEY CAN GET THEIR HANDS ON SOME WINDS. AND THERE'S BEEN SORT OF A CALL A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN DIRECT TO CONSUMER SHIPMENTS- WITH THE REDUCTION IN A WINERY VISITATIONS. I'M NOT SURE WE DO TOO- PANDEMIC RESTRICTIONS- WE'LL HAVE TO SEE IF THAT BEARS OUT OVER TIME- ALONG WITH THAT- I THINK- YOU FOLKS SEE IN SOME ECONOMIC HARD TIMES- THE VALUE. OF THE WIND HAS. HAS NOT GONE DOWN SLIGHTLY AS THE OVERALL PERCENTAGE- BUT ANYWAY IT'S STILL BEEN ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL PART OF OUR OF OUR INDUSTRY AND- IT'S A PRIVILEGE THAT WE- INTEND. TO HOLD ON TO. AS FOR A- AND- WE HOPE- WE ONLY MORE GROWTH IN THE END ON IT- IS ABLE TO HELP- WINERIES THROUGHOUT TELL AND INSPIRED AND TO ANY QUESTIONS. OUR MEMBERS ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR FOR ANYBODY ON THIS PANEL. SEVERAL THANK YOU SO MUCH TO HIM THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND- SEEMS LIKE WORDS OF TELLING RELLY NICELY I JUST WANTED TO- I WANTED TO JUST KIND OF POINT GET A DENTIST TO SPECIFICALLY I WAS SO INTERESTED IN THIS THIS ISSUE OF MISSION SPECIALIZED PROJECT PRODUCTS BECAUSE IT I THINK IT REALLY DOES SPEAK TO THE IMPORTANCE OF OR TRYING TO ADDRESS HERE. AND YOU KNOW THE END OF THE DAY FOR SOME OF THEM ARE MASS PRODUCED PRODUCTS THAT THAT ARE THAT ARE THAT ARE YOU THAT THAT THAT GENERATE INTEREST IN THE GENERAL PUBLIC THE STATUS QUO MAY BE FINE BUT- BUT IT BUT IT'S IF YOU CAN- CAN BE VERY FRUSTRATING FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT SOMETHING THAT'S NOT AS WELL KNOWN- AND THEN THEY'RE NOT REALLY ABLE TO GET IT BECAUSE THE YOU KNOW THE FOLKS WHO ARE NOW IN CHARGE OF. THE DISTRIBUTION JUST DON'T HAVE A MARKET IS NOT ENOUGH OF A MARKET FOR THEM TO. TAKE ON THE PRODUCTS SO CAN YOU CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT TO SERVE NEESON SPECIALIZED PRODUCTS AND ALSO HOW. HOW DID DIRECT TO CONSUMER SUPPORTS THE QUALITY OF CALIFORNIA PRODUCTS TO YOU MENTION THAT AS WELL I'D LOVE YOU TO. TO JUST EXPAND UPON YEAH I GUESS WHY IT MY MAJOR POINT THERE WAS- YOU KNOW OUR EXPERIENCES TAUGHT US. THAT PEOPLE PARTICIPATE IN DIRECT TO CONSUMER NOT NOT OUT OF. CONVENIENCE IT'S FRANKLY IT'S- MORE CONVENIENT FOR MOST PEOPLE TO GO TO THIS. STORE BECAUSE OF THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD RIGHT OVER A TRAIN BUT THEY THEY SEEK IT OUT BECAUSE THEY CAN GET A UNIQUE PRODUCT THAT THEY WOULDN'T OTHERWISE. BEABLE TO GET. AND IT'S FOR THAT REASON- YOU KNOW THAT THE WINERIES HAVE- YOU KNOW REALLY SOUGHT TO CREATE UNIQUE PRODUCTS THAT- WOULD. WOULD SORT OF JUSTIFY CONSUMERS INTEREST YOU KNOW AND- AND PARTICIPATING IN THE IN THEIR DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. YEAH SO- YOU KNOW WE HAVE SOME WINERIES WHERE. YOU KNOW. I'M I'M MAKING UP NUMBERS THE STATE- BUT YOU KNOW LIKE 90% OF THEIR PRODUCTS- THE GOES INTO RETAIL MARKETS MIGHT EITHER CABERNET SAUVIGNON AND THEIR- AND THEIR CHARDONNAY. AND YOU KNOW NOT. FRANKLY PAYS MOST OF THE BILLS- FOR THAT WINERY- BUT THEN THEY PRODUCE MAYBE. TWENTY OTHER DIFFERENT WINES IN VERY SMALL BATCHES. PRINCIPALLY FOR FOLKS THAT EITHER VISIT- THEY'RE TASTY ROOMS DIRECTLY OR PARTICIPATE IN THE WINE CLUBS AND- YOU KNOW IT'S A REAL- IT'S HIGHSMITH SHOULD JOIN THE WINE CLUB THAT YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW FRANKLY YOU CAN GET A WHY NOBODY ELSE DOES. RIGHT SO. AND I THINK THIS IS ALLOWED WINEMAKERS TO EXPERIMENT AND- CREATE UNIQUE PLANS AND AS A RESULT OF THAT REALLY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CREATE BETTER AND BETTER WINDS. OVERTIME I DIDN'T WORK. AT ALL TIME HIGH FOR CALIFORNIA WINE QUALITY AND I'M SURE THIS HA A. LOT TO DO WITH THAT. HAS THERE BEEN ANY I'M- BELIEVING ME ON THE OBVIOUS OF HOW. TO CONSUMERS HAVE AS X. NOW INTER TOPIC GROWN SOME INTEREST IN. WELL THE SO FOR THE TWO WITH WHAT HOW LAWS. COURSES THAT EACH STATE HOUSE TO. PASS LAWS TO. ALLOW FOR WHITES TO BE SHIPPED INTO THEIR STATE- AND MR BODY WAS STARTED DESCRIBING HOW THAT WORKS- I HAVE COLLEAGUES THAT WORK ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. OTHER REMARKABLE JOB OF OPENING UP THIS EXPERIENCE FOR FOLKS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THIS S REALLY FOSTERED A TOURISM WINE TOURISM- FROM FOLKS ARE ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHO ARE EXCITED TO. VISIT CALIFORNIA WINERIES AND EVEN WHEN THEY GET HOME. THEY CAN BRING THAT EXPERIENCE BACK WITH. SO ABSOLUTELY. ALL RIGHT THANKS MR BODY ARE YOU STILL ON THE LINE. OKAY THE WELL THEN WHY DON'T WE GO TO CENTER WAY SO HE'S QUESTION FOR- MISTER SMELTER POLICE. YES THANK YOU NOT I WANTED JUST TO CLARIFY IN TERMS OF HOW FAR THE BILL ACTUALLY- CAN BE APPLIED. BECAUSE I KNOW WE HAVE SOME LIMITATIONS FOR EXAMPLE OF. CALIFORNIA THE OUTSIDE VENDORS OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE UNITED STATES AND EVEN OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA IN CANADA AND MEXICO PURCHASE. WHAT PRODUCT THE PURCHASE BREAK GRAPES OR JUICE AND THEY TURN THAT INTO A GRAPE AND IT BECOMES THEIR GRAPES IN THEIR COUNTRY. AND WE OFTEN HAVE LIMITATIONS IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH WE CAN BRING IT TO THE COUNTRY IN THE UNITED STATES TO CONSUMER. HOW DOES THAT APPLY TO CANADA OTHER STATES I MEAN IT APPLIES TO OTHER STATES IN AMERICA DOES NOT GO OUTSIDE OF. CALIFORNIA MEXICO COLOR CANADA IN TERMS OF- WHAT HOW- THE LA LAW COULD SPUR CONSUMERS IN ACCESSING WINES FROM. OF THE REGION OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA. I AM EMBARRASSING ONLY NOT ABLE TO ANSWER THAT I- JUST NOT AS FAMILIAR WITH THE APPLICABILITY OF THIS PRIVILEGE- OUT OF THE COUNTRY- ARE YOU HAPPY TO GET BACK TO YOU ABOUT I'M SORRY SOMETHING THAT SOMETHING I SHOULD KNOW IT WASN'T A QUESTION I PREPARED FOR AND SO MAYBE YOU CAN ANSWER- IT APPLIES TO- STATES OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA. YEAH ABSOLUTELY AND SO HOW WOULD THAT WORK PRACTICALLY A FIND AS I THE CONSUMER HOW WOULD I PARTICIPATE. IN THE APPLICATION OF THIS NEW LAW- WELL OBVIOUSLY FOR WINE THIS IS AN EXISTING LAW- SO- YOU KNOW I CAN'T REALLY SPEAK TO. SENATOR ALAN STILL BUT- WITH REGARD. NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS YOU COULD HAVE WIND SHIFT YOU DIRECTLY- YOU COULD JUST YOU KNOW IF YOU WORK FROM. YOU KNOW COLORADO OR WHATEVER AND YOU CAME TO VISIT NAPA VALLEY YOU ENJOYED THE WIND. THAT ONE OF THE WINERIES YOU VISITED SIGNED UP FOR THEIR WINE CLUB. ON A SUBSCRIPTION BASIS ARE YOU KIND OF WINE- DELIERED DIRECTLY TO YOUR DOORSTEP EVERY QUARTER MIND YOUR WHATEVER YOU KNOW SHE CAPTIONED YOU CHOSE. ALTERNATIVELY YOU COULD YOU KNOW CALL THE WINERY OR OR GET ONLINE AND ORDER BOTTLES TO BE SHIPPED DIRECTLY TO YOU. BUT THERE ARE MANY LONG IS THAT STATES HAVE LAWS THAT ALLOWED FOR AS YOU KNOW THERE'S ACTUALLY HAS TO BE RECIPROCITY BETWEEN TWO STATE TROOPERS TO ALLOW BUT THAT'S THOSE ARE THE LAWS THAT MY COLLEAGUES. HAVE BEEN WORKING ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND- SOMETHING LIKE 99% OF- ENOUGH AGAIN MAKING UP NUMBERS BUT OF. AMERICANS ARE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS. SO I THINK WOULD CENTERS GETTING TO MR SMALL. IF WE HAVE A IF WE HAVE A WALLETS WRISTLETS BECAUSE IT IS CURRENT LAW THAT WENT ON ONLINE IN THE UNITED STATES IN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TODAY. SO ASSUMING THAT THE LAWS ARE OKAY IN OTHER STATES. OR EVEN OTHER COUNTRIES THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM. TO GO DIRECT TO CONSUMER IS THERE ANY PROHIBITION- AGAINST WIND COMING IN FROM OTHER STATES OR OTHER COUNTRIES. I DON'T THINK SO BUT THAT'S WHAT I SAID I WISH I DO THE DIRECT ANSWER I'VE I'VE WATCHED AND OBSERVE AMERICA'S I DON'T- I'M HAPPY TO SAY GET THAT INFORMATION HERE. SO IN THE EXAMPLE OF COLORADO- HUH YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER THERE'S A LIMIT I COULD ORDER CASES- PALLETS OF WINE AS A CONSUMER. THERE ARE ART SHAPES DIFFERENT STATES HAVE DIFFERENT RULES AND THIS IS THIS IS PART OF WHAT I WAS SPEAKING WITH WITH- TOO WITH THIS SORT OF LABYRINTH. OF RULES OUT THERE SO SOME STATES MAY ONLY ALLOW FOR ONE OR TWO CASES. OF WINE- A YEAR AND BUT THEY HAVE TO HAVE SIMILAR LAWS APPLIED TO THEIR IN STATE. WINERIES ABILITY AS WELL SO- THOSE LAWS DON'T COUNT CALIFORNIA ALLOWS FOR UNLIMITED BUT OTHER STATES. HAVE DIFFERENT LAWS AND THOSE LAWS. DON'T TRIGGER FEDERAL TRADE. LOS AT THE- NOT A LAWYER BUT- YOU KNOW THIS PRIVILEGE WAS ESSENTIALLY- WHY NOT- YOU KNOW IN A SUPREME COURT CASE THAT- THAT- WAS FOLLOWED THROUGH- IN DEALING WITH THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE ISSUES MR BODY WAS WORDS TRYING TO SPEAK TO THAT AND IS MUCH MORE QUALIFIED TO THAT ITEMS. WE COULDN'T HEAR HIS SPEECH SO THEY HAVE. OKAY THANK YOU ALL RIGHT SORRY I COULDN'T ABOUT ANYBODY ELSE WISHING TO CENTER RUBIO. THANK YOU TERRA DOT- I'M SORRY I WALKED IN A LITTLE LATE SO HOPEFULLY YOU HAVEN'T DISCUSSED THIS BUT I'M JUST A LITTLE CURIOUS I KNOW THAT. WITH THE QUARANTINE OF COAL FED DOT ONLINE SALES HAVE EXPLODED INTO A LOT OF BUSINESSES ARE DOING REALLY WELL AND IT MY NOT BE A FAIR QUESTION WHEN I'M OUT SINCE YOU'RE NOT DOING IT NOW BUT I'M JUST WONDERING IF YOU'VE- DELVED INTO AN ANALYSIS OF MAYBE OTHER STATES OTHER COUNTRY TEST TO SEE WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE IN TERMS OF SALES AND I. IN MY MIND I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT HOW DETRIMENTAL COLBERT HAS BEEN TO SOME OF OUR BUSINESSES AND HOW IT WOULD HELP THEM. IN TERMS OF SALES AND FOR OUR STATE HE NOT TAX DOLLARS IS THERE ANY TYPE OF ANALYSIS THAT YOU CAN PROVIDE FOR US TO SEE YOU KNOW THE BENEFITS TO CALIFORNIA TO THE ACTUAL BUSINESS OWNERS X. CETERA A LITTLE BIT EARLIER I THINK THAT THIS ABILITY TO- SHIPPED DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS WAS ABSOLUTELY A LIFELINE ESPECIALLY FOR SMALLER WINERIES- THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC RESTRICTIONS- HOWEVER- I. I THINK SALES OVERALL- OUT OF THE SMALLER ONE SECTORS- WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY. DOWN THIS WAS MORE OF A LIFELINE AND THEN AT THE END WELCOME YOU KNOW A BOON. RETAIL SALES ACT ACTUALLY- DID INCREASE SO IF YOU WERE IF YOU WERE SELLING INTO RETAIL CHANNELS- YOU ACTUALLY. HAVE THE OPTION TO EXPERIENCE GROWTH THAT I'M I'M SURE YOU KNOW DIFFERENT LINERS ARE GONNA HAVE. DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES BUT THE INABILITY TO- PROVIDE DIRECT HOSPITALITY OUT WINERIES- YOU KNOW IT'S A DATA DEVASTATING IMPACT ON ON A LOT OF SMALLER WINERIES. AND BUT FOR THIS ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO SHIP ON DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS. WE WOULD HAVE SEEN SCORES AND SCORES OF. WINERIES- SHUT THEIR DOORS. RIGHT AND- THANK YOU. THEY WERE. VERY HI MICHELLE SIR- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH WINE IS SHIPPED EVERY YEAR IN CALIFORNIA MIGHT HELP GOTTEN ONE WE SEE I WONDER IF YOU SHIFT TO LIKE TO CALIFORNIA CUSTOMERS YES- IT IS THANKS. APPROXIMATELY TWO MILLION SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE CASES TO PROTECT A BOTTLE. YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT ABOUT- A LITTLE OVER TWO POINT THREE- THE MILLION CASES OF WINE WERE SHIPPED DIRECTLY TO CONTEST CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS THIS IS THIS IS THE NUMBER- FROM- TWENTY TWENTY AND WAS SIGNIFICANTLY- UP. ALMOST ALMOST 20% AND BACK OVER THE PREVIOUS YEAR WHICH IS DUE ALMOST CERTAINLY TO NOT BEING ABLE TO SELL DIRECTLY ON PROMISES STOP WINERY. WHETHER THAT'S ABOUT THAT'S LITTLE OVER UNDERSTANDING. QUITE RIGHT YET TWO POINT TWO ZERO YEAH THERE'S LIKE A THERE'S- SOMETHING BUY IT AT THAT THIS IS A U. DOES THE UNITED STATES BUT YOUR BUT IT CAN BE INTERPRETED BACK CALIFORNIA THERE'S ABOUT. THREE HUNDRED MILLION CASES OF WINE THAT THAT ENTER THE MARKET PLACE EVERY YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES ABOUT TWO POINT 2% OF THAT STRUCTURE CONSUMER. AT WICHITA FROM CALIFORNIA ACCOUNTS IT TRANSLATES INTO ABOUT FIVE MILLION CASES AND DIRECTLY TO CALIFORNIA CUSTOMERS. A LITTLE OVER TWO POINT THREE MILLION CASES SO YOU KNOW ABOUT HALF OF THAT GOES TO A CALIFORNIA CUSTOMERS THE OTHER HALF CONSULTS FOR. IT DO YOU SEE I GUESS I'VE I THINK SOME QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO ME TO ADDRESS ARE. YOU HOW THE TAXES ARE COLLECTED WHEN WINE IS SHIPPED BOTH TO THE CONSUMER IN CALIFORNIA AND OTHER STATES IN. THE JUST YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY NOBODY WANTS LEAKAGE OF THOSE- YELLED TAXES IF THEY HAVE TO PAY THOSE TAXES- AT THE RETAIL THEY SHOULD PAY THEM AT THE- DIRECT TO CONSUMER I DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S ARGUING. THAT POINT BUT IS THERE A LEAKAGE IS THAT AN ISSUE RIGHT NOW THAT'S BEEN NOTICED IN. THE DTC FOR WINE- TRIP CERTAINLY- NOT AN R. X. THAT'S I REFER TO OUR- THAT'S- WINERIES ARE ALMOST. ALL OF THEM DIRECT RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING TAXES ARE PAID AND THEN LICENSES APPROPRIATE LICENSES ARE HELD. AND YOU KNOW YOU. IF YOU DON'T DO THIS YOU RISK YOUR LICENSE YOUR ABILITY TO DO BUSINESS THAT WE REJECT THIS VERY SERIOUSLY AND IT'S- YOU KNOW FOR THESE REASONS. WE USE THESE NEW SERVICES. SORRY I MISSED WHAT I DIDN'T HAVE I THINK MY- MY PHONE ON TO THAT STRONG INSURANCE FOR THE INTEGRITY OF THE PROGRAM YEAH ABSOLUTELY ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER SMELTER MISSED MR BODY IF YOU'RE STILL ON THE LINE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR BEING WITH US TODAY WILL NOW MOVE FORWARD. NOT TO THE FOLLOWING PANEL WILL BEGIN WITH MR ALEX- BILL CONNOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA ARTIST ARTISANAL GUILD. MR BILL CONNOR YOU CAN BEGIN. ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU WRITE YOUR DADA CENTER ALLEN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MY NAME IS ALEX AVILA KHAN AND I AM REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA ARTISANAL DISTILLERS GUILD GUILD I MADE UP OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY CRAFT DISTILLERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I'M I HAVE A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE ON THIS ISSUE BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN A SMALL WINERY OWNER AND WINEMAKER DISTILLER. OWNER FOR TWENTY EIGHT YEARS AND STARTED A CRAFT DISTILLERY INSIDE OF MY WINERY TEN YEARS AGO. BUT IF YOU'RE PAST REBELS ON CALIFORNIA'S CENTRAL COAST. SO I DEAL WITH A LOT OF THE REGULATIONS YOU WERE JUST DISCUSSING WHETHER IT'S YOU KNOW FILING PAPERS SHIPPING AND ALL OF THAT STUFF SO I DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND THE NEW WANTS. MY EXPERIENCE IN BOTH INDUSTRIES GAVE ME FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF DIRECT CONSUMER SHIPPING FOR THE SMALL BUSINESS. MY EXPERIENCE ALSO GIVES ME THE PERSPECTIVE NOW THE DTC LET DTC LEGISLATION WILL BENEFIT ALL STAKEHOLDERS THE DISTILLERS WHOLESALERS RETAILERS AND LABOR. CONSUMERS AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE ALCOHOL DTT DTC CONVERSATIONS NOT NEW AND WE HAVE THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT IN THAT WE CAN LOOK AT THE IMPACT THAT DTC HAS HAD ON THE CALIFORNIA WINE INDUSTRY. FOR THE PAST THREE DECADES. PRIOR TO NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX WINERIES ARE IN THE SAME SITUATION A CRAFT DISTILLERY SPACE TODAY. DTC LEGISLATION FOR WINERIES CREATED A FINANCIAL BOON FOR ALL STAKEHOLDERS WHILE POSITIONING CALIFORNIA AS A LEADER IN THE U. S. WIND INDUSTRY. IT WILL DO THE SAME FOR DISTILLERIES. HERE THE NUMBERS ACCORDING TO BOTH WINE INSTITUTE AND SHIP COMPLIANT A COMPANY THAT DOES A LOT OF THE- REPORTING THAT- WE WERE TAUGHT JUST TALKING ABOUT. AND HOW DIRECT TO CONSUMER SHIPPING FOR CALIFORNIA WINES ENDED UP BENEFITING EVERYONE. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX THERE WERE SEVEN HUNDRED WINERIES PRODUCING APPROXIMATELY FIVE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF WINE IN CALIFORNIA. NOW AS WE MENTIONED THERE'S FOUR THOUSAND WINERIES IN THE STATE PRODUCING CLOSE TO FORTY BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF WINE. WINERIES PRODUCE A FIFTY SEVEN POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN CALIFORNIA. WINERIES GENERATES SEVEN POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS IN CALIFORNIA AND LOCAL TAXES. WINERIES CURRENTLY EMPLOYED THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS. AS WE LOOK AT CALIFORNIA'S CRAFT DISTILLING INDUSTRY TODAY WE ARE AT THE INFANCY STAGE LIKE WINE WAS IN THE EIGHTIES. WITHOUT PTC LEGISLATION CRAFTERS DEALERS ONLY HAVE TWO PATHS TO MARKET JUST LIKE WINERIES DID BEFORE NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX BOTH PATTISON POSTS HUGE BARRIERS TO ENTRY. THE FIRST IS FOR DISTILLERY TO PURCHASE AROUND EFFICIENTLY IN A HIGH TRAFFIC AREA WHERE CONSUMERS CAN VISIT AND PURCHASED THEIR SPIRITS THE TASTING ROOM. AND EVEN THE COSTA CALIFORNIA REAL ESTATE AND THE CURRENT LAW THAT LIMITS CONSUMER PURCHASES TO TWO POINT TWO FIVE LITERS PER PERSON PER DAY THIS PATH POSES ENORMOUS FINANCIAL CHALLENGES. FOR SMALL START UP BRANDS LIKE MY OWN. THE SECOND PATH TO MARKET FOR DISTILLERIES THROUGH THE THREE TIER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM WHICH ALSO POSES HUGE OBSTACLES FOR SMALL UNDER CAPITALIZED DISTILLERIES. WHOLESALERS HAVE THOUSANDS OF BRANDS MOST WITH MULTIPLE PRODUCTS THEREFORE TO GENERATE THE NUMBER OF CASES TO BE PROFITABLE THROUGH DISTRIBUTION IS CAPITAL INTENSIVE AND ALSO CHALLENGING IF THERE'S NO BRAND RECOGNITION. OR SALES FORCE TO HELP SUPPORT IT IN THE MARKETPLACE. THEREFORE DISTRIBUTION IS NOT GEARED FOR THE SMALL INDEPENDENT CRAFT DISTILLERS LIKE ME THAT ARE OWNED AND OPERATED A BASIC FUNDING IT WITH A DREAM AND HARD WORKING A BANK LOAN. MOST CALIFORNIA DISTILLERS WOULD LOVE TO EVENTUALLY PARTNER WITH DISTRIBUTORS BUT NEED TO INCREASE SALES BEFORE DISTRIBUTOR CAN PROFITABLY WORK WITH THEM. WE ALWAYS SAY THAT DTC IS THE DISTRIBUTION ON RAMP FOR SMALL DISTILLERIES ENABLING US TO GROW TO A POINT WHERE WE CAN BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE THREE TIER SYSTEM. OVER THE PAST TWENTY ONE MONTHS THANKFULLY DUE TO THE A. B. C.'S EMERGENCY ORDER CALIFORNIA'S DEALERS HAVE BEEN ALLOWED AND HAVE PROVED THAT WE CAN SAFELY SHIP SPIRIT USING COMMON CARRIERS LIKE UPS. REQUIRING SIGNATURE VERIFICATION JUST LIKE THE WINERIES TO. DOING SO THE STATE HELP SAVE OUR SMALL BUSINESS INCLUDING INCLUDING MY OWN. INCREASED JOBS WHILE PROVIDING SAFE AVENUES FOR CONSUMERS TO RECEIVE THE PRODUCTS THEY WANT. THE SENTENCING DTC DIRECT CONSUMER AS AN ISSUE WHERE SOMEONE LOSES WE SHOULD LOOK AT THE WINE INDUSTRY TO SEE THAT ALL STAKEHOLDERS CAN BENEFIT. THE WHOLESALERS AND RETAILERS BENEFIT A STUDY DONE BY CHIP COMPLIANT WAY MENTIONED EARLIER SHOWED THAT. BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN AND TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THE WINE INDUSTRY'S SALES GREW FROM THIRTY ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TO FORTY BILLION DOLLARS. OF THIS SALES INCREASE CLOSE 260% STILL WENT THROUGH THE TRADITIONAL WHOLESALE AND RETAIL CHANNELS SO WHOLESALERS AND RETAILERS IN A TEN YEAR PERIOD GAINED OVER FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN SALES. THE LABOR BENEFITS DTC ALLOWS DISTILLERS TO GROW BY SHIPPING PRODUCT VIA CARRIERS LIKE UPS FEDEX AND CONSUMERS ARTIFACTS TO CONSUMERS. AS A RESULT DISTILLERIES BRO HIRING NEW EMPLOYEES THEY CAN BUY TANKS AND BARRELS AND GLASS AND COURSE MATERIALS WHICH ALL GET DELIVERED VIA TRUCKING INDUSTRY. IF DTC DOESN'T GO THROUGH GROWTH OF DISTILLERS STAYS SLOW WHICH WILL KEEP LABOR STAGNANT. AND ULTIMATELY THE CONSUMER BATON BENEFIT. THE CONSUMER BENEFITS BY PROVIDING THEM WITH THE SAFETY AND CHOICE CONSUMERS ARE BUSY IN DEMAND THE ABILITY TO PURCHASE SPIRITS FROM THE CONVENIENCE OF THEIR COMPUTER JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER PURCHASE THEY MAKE. GOOD WINE AT DINNER GROCERIES CLOTHING WHATEVER YOU CAN IMAGINE THESE DAYS. THE CONSUMER DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE IN SHIPPING LAWS BETWEEN WINE AND SPIRITS THEY SEE BOTH AS PART OF THE SAME CALIFORNIA CRAFT ALCOHOL INDUSTRY. BY PURCHASING DIRECTLY FROM THE PRODUCER OF THE CONSUMER GETS QUALITY ACCOUNTABILITY AND A SENSE OF SUPPORTING A CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS. HOW CALIFORNIA CAN BENEFIT. WELL SPIRITS EXCISE TAXES THREE DOLLARS AND THIRTY CENTS A GALLON SIXTEEN AND A HALF TIMES HIGHER THAN THE TWENTY CENTS PER GALLON OF WINE. A MERE 25% OF THE VOLUME OF THE WINERIES IT COULD RE REPRESENTED DITION OF HALF A BILLION DOLLARS IN NEW EXCISE TAXES. ON TOP OF THE JOBS TOURISM SALES AND EXCISE TAXES NEW PRODUCTION FACILITIES WILL GENERATE NEW REAL ESTATE TAXES THAT WILL IN TURN BENEFIT LOCAL COMMUNITIES SCHOOL FIRE AND POLICE. A WIN FOR THE STATE AND FOR THE COMMUNITIES. IN CONCLUSION SINCE MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY CALIFORNIA DISTILLERS HAVE BEEN SAFELY SHIPPING DIRECT TO CONSUMER AND EVERYONE HAS BEEN BENEFITING. WE NEED DIRECT TO CONSUMER SHIPPING TO BE MADE PERMANENT. SO CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESSES CAN GROW AND THRIVE. AS THE WINE INDUSTRY HAS DEMONSTRATED OVER THE PAST THIRTY FIVE YEARS. I ASK YOU TO FOLLOW THE ROAD MAP OF THE WINE INDUSTRY HAS ALREADY PROVIDED AND SUPPORT PERMANENT DTC SHIPPING. THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR TIME IN YOUR CONSIDERATION IN THIS MATTER I I'LL BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS ACTORS PANELS OVER. VERY MUCH MISTER BILL CONNOR. WILL NOW MOVE TO MISTER DAVID OSCO WOULD DISCUSS. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I'M DAVID US GO FROM THE DISTILLED SPIRITS COUNCIL OF THE UNITED STATES MORE COMMONLY KNOWN AS DISCUSSED. WE ARE THE NATIONAL TRADE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING THE LEADING PRODUCERS AND MARKETERS OF DISTILLED SPIRITS SOLD IN THE U. S. DISCUS HAS BEEN WORKING IN CONCERT WITH THE AMERICAN CRAFT DISTILLERS ASSOCIATION THE AMERICAN DISTILLING INSTITUTE AND THE CALIFORNIA ARTISANAL DISTILLERS GUILD ON DIRECT TO CONSUMER SHIPPING TOMORROW WROTE EQUAL TREATMENT FOR DISTILLED SPIRITS. WITH THE DISTILLED SPIRITS INDUSTRY AND ENSURE THAT SPIRITS MAY ENJOY THE SAME RIGHTS THE WINE INDUSTRY HAS ENJOYED FOR DECADES. MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ORGANIZING THIS THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON DIRECT TO CONSUMER SHIPPING FOR CONSUMER SPIRITS CONSUMERS OR AS WE HAVE BEEN CALLING IT DISTILLERY TO DOORBELL. THIS CASE IS PLEASED TO REPRESENT DISTILLED SPIRITS MANUFACTURERS WHILE THERE ARE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON THE APPROACH TO THIS POLICY AMONG MANUFACTURERS THERE IS STRONG SUPPORT FOR A SET OF FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES TO GUIDE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF DIRECT TO CONSUMER SHIPPING LEGISLATION. AND STATES THAT CHOOSE TO PURSUE EXPANDING CONSUMER ACCESS TO DISTILLED SPIRITS PRODUCTS SIMILAR TO THE ACCESS CONSUMERS HAVE. MORE WINE ENHANCED CONVENIENCE WHEN IT COMES TO PURCHASING THEIR THEIR FAVORITE PRODUCTS INCLUDING DISTILLED SPIRITS. WHETHER PRODUCED IN STATE OUT OF STATE OR OUT OF THE U. S. IN RECENT YEARS THE WORLD OF COMMERCE HAS CHANGED AND WILL CONTINUE TO CHANGE DRAMATICALLY. PARTICULARLY IN THE WAKE OF THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. OUT THE PANDEMIC IT'S CERTAINLY ONE REASON FOR CONSUMERS DEMANDING MORE CONVENIENCE BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT CODE ONLY ACCELERATED CHANGES WE'RE ALREADY SEEING IN THE MARKET PLACE. NOW I KNOW WE'RE ALL HOPEFUL THAT THE WORST OF THE PANDEMIC IS BEHIND US BUT CONSUMERS NOW MORE THAN EVER OR SHOPPING FOR PRODUCTS PRODUCTS IN MANY CHANNELS AND WE ALL MUST ADAPT TO MEET CONSUMER DEMAND. DISCUSS RECENTLY RETAINED IWS ARTICLE CONSUMERS ABOUT THEIR INTEREST IN BEING ABLE TO HAVE SPIRITS PRODUCTS SHIPPED TO THEM WHITE WINE. SO WHAT THE SURVEY SHOWED IS THAT NATIONALLY 73% OF ALL HOUSEHOLDS. NATIONWIDE SHOPPED ONLINE FOR GROCERIES AND SHOPPING ONLINE MORE FREQUENTLY THAN LAST YEAR. 80% OF CONSUMERS SURVEYED BELIEVE DISTILLERS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO SHIP DIRECTLY SHIP THEIR PRODUCTS TO LEGAL AGE CONSUMERS IN ANY STATE AGREED THAT THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO ORDER SPIRITS DIRECTLY FROM DISTILLERS AND THAT DISTILLERS SHOULD HAVE THE SAME PRIVILEGES AS WINERIES TO DIRECTION. WHILE CONSUMERS DESIRE FOR ENHANCED CONVENIENCE IS SUPPORTED BY THE USE OF THIRD PARTY E. COMMERCE WEBSITES. THERE ARE FOR EXAMPLE THE SPOKE PRODUCTS AND THOSE MADE BY CRAFT DISTILLERS IN INCLUDING HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT PART AVAILABLE THROUGH THESE PLATFORMS. WE BELIEVE THAT ALLOWING DISTILLERIES TO SHIP DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS JUST AS THE WINE INDUSTRY IS PERMITTED IN FORTY SEVEN STATES COULD HELP MEET THIS GROWING CONSUMER DEMAND. CURRENTLY ELEVEN STATES INCLUDING THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA ALLOW DIRECT TO CONSUMER SHIPPING OF SPIRITS IN SOME FORM OR FASHION AND FIVE OTHER STATES INCLUDING CAROL CALIFORNIA ARE TEMPORARILY ALLOWING LIMITED INSTATE SHIPPING DURING THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC- SOME DISTILLERS THE ABILITY TO SHIP THEIR SPIRITS RODUCTS DIRECTLY TO THEIR CONSUMERS BECAME A CRITICAL LIFELINE. WHILE THEIR DISTILLERY TASTING ROOM HOURS AND TOURS WERE CURTAILED DURING THE PANDEMIC. MANY OF OUR MEMBERS ALSO UTILIZE NEW AND EXISTING MODELS TO DELIVER SPIRITS FROM RETAILERS THROUGH THE THREE TIER SYSTEM INCLUDING THE USE OF THIRD PARTY E. COMMERCE WEBSITES THAT ALLOW CONSUMERS TO PURCHASE. ONLINE AND HAVE IT DELIVERED TO THEIR DOORSTEP RESPONSIBLY. THOSE MODELS WHICH ARE UTILIZED BY WINE PRODUCTS PRODUCERS AS WELL OPERATE WITHIN THE STATE'S EXISTING REGULATORY THREE TIER STRUCTURE AND ALL MEMBERS OF THE DISCUS CONTINUE TO SUPPORT SUCH MODELS. THESE KEY COMMERCE MODELS HAVE PROVIDED NEW CONVENIENT ACCESS FOR CONSUMERS WHEN A PRODUCT IS AVAILABLE THROUGH AN ACCESSIBLE RETAILER. DISTILLERY TO DOORBELL LEGISLATION WILL PROVIDE FURTHER CONSUMER CONVENIENCE BY ENABLING CONSUMERS TO ORDER A BESPOKE OR LIMITED RELEASE PRODUCTS THAT ARE NOT AVAILABLE THROUGH LOCAL. RETAILERS LAST IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING MUCH NEEDED SUPPORT TO CALIFORNIA CRAFT DISTILLERS FACING FINANCIAL HARDSHIP DUE TO THE NINETEEN BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS DISRUPTIONS. ADOPTING DISTILLERY THE DOORBELL LEGISLATION TO PERMANENTLY ALLOW DISTILLERIES TO SHIP. TO CONSUMERS CREATES A MORE CONVENIENT MARKET PLACE IN RESPONSE TO CONSUMERS DEMAND. FOR INCREASED CHOICE AND VARIETY THREE TIER SYSTEM AND WE BELIEVE THAT DISTILLERY THE DOORBELL LEGISLATION WILL BE A GREAT COMPLEMENT TO TRADITIONAL DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. AS WE'VE SEEN IN THE WINE INDUSTRY THE VAST MAJORITY OF SALES WILL CONTINUE TO FLOW THROUGH ALL THREE TIERS BUT DIRECT TO CONSUMER LEGISLATION WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CONSUMER CONVENIENCE AND ACCESS TO PRODUCTS THAT ARE NOT AVAILABLE IN THEIR LOCAL MARKET. IN THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS THE NUMBER OF DISTILLERIES HAS INCREASED FROM AROUND SEVENTY TO MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND NATIONWIDE. INCREASINGLY CONSUMERS WANT TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE NEW AND EXCITING SPIRITS PRODUCTS THAT OFTEN MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN THEIR STATE. CERTAINLY EXPANDING DISTILLERS ABILITY TO DIRECTIONS SPIRITS TO CONSUMERS WILL ALSO INTRODUCE MORE CONSUMERS TO CALIFORNIA CRAFT DISTILLER BRANDS AND PRODUCTS. CONSUMERS WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO OBTAIN LIMITED RELEASE PRODUCTS AND CLUB OFFERINGS OR TO SHIP PRODUCTS HOME DIRECTLY AFTER VISITING A DISTILLERY. DISCUS MEMBERS ARE FULLY COMMITTED TO RESPONSIBLE CONSUMPTION AND ENCOURAGE MODERATION FOR ADULTS WHO CHOOSE TO DRINK ALCOHOL WE KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA ALONG WITH FORTY SEVEN OTHER STATES HAVE SUCCESSFULLY AND SAFELY ALLOWED WINE PRODUCTS TO SHIP WINE PRODUCERS TO SHIP WINE TO CONSUMERS IN THE STATES FOR YEARS. THE PAST TWO YEARS HAVE SHOWN US THE SPEED AT WHICH MARKETS CAN CHANGE AND THE ROUTE TO MARKET FOR DISTILLED SPIRITS PRODUCTS CONTINUES TO MOVE ALL. WE APPRECIATE THAT ANY COMPREHENSIVE DIRECT TO CONSUMER MODEL NEEDS TO ACCOUNT FOR ALL STAKEHOLDER INTERESTS REGULATORS DISTILLERS WHOLESALERS RETAILERS AND CONSUMERS. AND WE CERTAINLY THINK THAT THE CHAIRMAN AND THE COMMITTEE FOR INCLUDING JUSTICE TODAY FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE INPUT AT THIS JUNCTURE. ACCOUNTING FOR ALL STAKEHOLDER VIEWS WILL HELP TO ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATION IS WELL THOUGHT OUT AND AVOID ANY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. AND DURING IMPLEMENTATION. SO TO ASSISTANT DIRECTOR IN DEVELOPING SOUND DIRECT CONSUMER SHIPPING-LEGISLATION DISCUSSES ADOPTED SEVERAL PRINCIPLES THAT WE BELIEVE WILL HELP ENSURE THAT THE LONGSTANDING EFFECTIVE. AND ROBUST REGULATORY SYSTEM FOR BEVERAGE ALCHOL YEAH IF YOU'RE IN CALIFORNIA. WILL CONTINUE TO FIRST PROTECT THE PUBLIC HEALTH SECONDGUARD AGAINST UNDERAGE SALES AND THIRD ENSURE THAT THE STATE TAX COLLECTIONS- OR OR- THAT THE STATE COLLECTS ALL TAXES FOR SALES WITHIN THEIR BORDERS. SO SOME OF OUR PRINCIPLES INCLUDE THE FIRST SUPPORT WE SUPPORT REASONABLE SHIPPING LIMITATIONS ON DIRECT TO CONSUMER PURCHASES. SECONDLY WE WANT WOULD LIKE TO INSURE THAT BROUGHT. THAT PRODUCT IN. THREE TIER SYSTEM INTEGRITY- WE INSURE THE FULL A BLACK HOLE AND SALES TAXES TO THE STATE WHERE THE PRODUCT IS DELIVERED. REQUIRE EFFECTIVE SAFEGUARDS AGAINST UNDERAGE PURCHASES AND FINALLY REQUIRE ANY ALCOHOL DIRECTORSHIP OR IN THE CARRIER TO MAINTAIN DETAILED RECORDS SO CERTAINLY HELP WITH- ANY SORT OF AUDIT TRAIL. SO WHILE THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE DISCUSS PRINCIPLES WE'LL BE HAPPY TO HAVE A MORE DETAILED CONVERSATION REGARDING THE POLICY CONSIDERATIONS- CONSIDERING THESE PRINCIPLES. IN CLOSING IT'S CLEAR THAT THE WORLD OF COMMERCE IS CHANGED AND MARKETS MUST ADAPT TO MEET CONSUMER DEMAND WHEREVER THEY ARE SHOPPING AND LOOKING FOR NEW PRODUCTS. YOU WILL NO DOUBT HEAR SCARE TACTICS ABOUT THE PRACTICE OF DIRECT TO CONSUMER SHIPPING. OPPONENTS OF ALLOWING DIRECT TO CONSUMER SHIPPING- SPIRITS TO CONSUMERS WILL RELATE STORIES OF INADEQUATE TAX COLLECTIONS IN VIRGINIA ON WINE SHIPMENTS WHICH WERE SUBSEQUENTLY AND VERY PROUDLY RESOLVED BY THE VIRGINIA ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE CONTROL AUTHORITY. THEY ALSO CITE INSTANCES OF LAWSUITS FILED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MICHIGAN AGAINST RETAILERS. GET IT THAT'S RETAILERS NOT SUPPLIERS ILLEGALLY DELIVERING WINE TO CONSUMERS IN THE STATE THE KEY WORD HERE BEING ILLEGAL. WE URGE YOU TO FOCUS ON THE FACTS AND TO ASK POINTED QUESTIONS WE URGE YOU NOT TO LET FALSE OR BASELESS CLAIMS DISSUADE YOU FROM CONSIDERATION OF APPROPRIATE RESPONSIBLE. AND BALANCED LEGISLATION. AND SOME WE ASK THAT YOU GO ALONG BEYOND THE HEADLINE CONSIDER THE FULL STORY BEHIND THE SENSATIONALIZE ASSERTIONS. ALL THAT SAID WITH THE PROPER SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE AFTER HAVING ASKED THE RIGHT QUESTIONS. ALL STAKEHOLDERS IN THE INDUSTRY WE BELIEVE THERE IS NO PUBLIC POLICY REASON WHY THE SPIRITS INDUSTRY SHOULD BE PRECLUDED FROM MARKET MARKET ACCESS CHANNELS THAT HAVE BEEN ENJOYED BY WINE PRODUCERS AND THEIR CUSTOMERS. AROUND THE COUNTRY FOR DECADES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION AND I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. MR OSCAR- WE'RE GONNA BE ASKING QUESTIONS AFTER MANY SPOKEN BUT I WOULD LIKE- MISTRUST GO TO FOR YOU TO GET YOUR GUIDING PRINCIPLES TO OUR- CHIEF CONSULTANT SO THIS. COULD BE HANDED OUT TO OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ARE NEVER GONNA MOVE TO MISTER ERIC GREGORY PRESIDENT THE KENTUCKY DISTILLERS ASSOCIATION MISTER GREGORY. YOU CAN BEGIN. WELL THANK YOU CHAIRMAN DIED- SENATOR ALLEN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS HI MY NAME IS ERIC GREGORY AND I'M PRESIDENT OF THE KENTUCKY DISTILLERS ASSOCIATION. WE'RE A NONPROFIT TRADE GROUP THAT WAS FOUNDED ACTUALLY WAY BACK IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY. WE REPRESENT SIXTY FIVE DISTILLERS FROM GLOBAL GIANTS LIKEJIM BEAM KEVIN HILL OF BROWN FORMAN. TO DOZENS OF SMALL FAMILY OWNED CRAFT DISTILLERS THAT ARE TRULY BUILDING THE NEXT GENERATION OF OUR TIMELESS CRAFT. KENTUCKY IS YOU KNOW IS THE BIRTHPLACE OF BOURBON- WE CRAFT 95% OF THE WORLD'S SUPPLY. WITH A RICH HISTORY HERITAGE DATES BACK MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YEARS. AND LIKE CALIFORNIA WINE- THOUGH NOT AS BIG KENTUCKY BOURBON IS A SIGNATURE INDUSTRY HERE AND A SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC AND TOURISM ENGINE FOR THE STATE- WE GENERATE BY NINE BILLION DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC OUTPUT EVERY YEAR EMPLOY ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND. OUR WORKING KENTUCKY THIS END- GENERATE ABOUT BILLION DOLLARS IN PAYROLL. END OF FUN FACT THERE ARE NOW TEN POINT THREE MILLION BARRELS OF BOURBON CURRENTLY AGING IN KENTUCKY THAT'S A RECORD. MEETING WE HAVE TWICE AS MANY BARRELS OF BOURBON HERE THAT WE HAVE ACTUALLY PEOPLE LIVING IN THE COMMONWEALTH OF KENTUCKY- NOW I COULD TALK ABOUT ARBOR MIST YALI MOM BUT WE'RE HERE TO ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT THREAT CONSUMER SHIPPING WHICH IS A RLATIVELY NEW ENDEAVOR. FOR KENTUCKY BOURBON IN THE SPIRITS INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE. BUT FIRST LET ME EXPLAIN WE SAY THANKS TO CALIFORNIA REALLY FOR LEADING THE WAY. WHEN WE CREATED THE KENTUCKY BOURBON TRAIL IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE. WE SIMPLY WERE TRYING TO REPLICATE THE INTERNATIONAL SUCCESS THAT CALIFORNIA HAD CREATED. BY PAIRING WINE INTERESTS. AND THE SAME GOES FOR SPIRITS AND SHIPPING. CALIFORNIA AS YOU HEARD HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLY SHIPPING IT'S ONE FOR DECADES NOW. AND WE'RE SIMPLY FOLLOWING THE INNOVATIVE PATH THAT YOU'VE CHARTERED. AND CONTINUE MAKING THAT CONNECTION WITH BOURBON LOVERS AROUND THE WORLD. WELL SPIRITS ARE NOWHERE NEAR THE FORTY SEVEN STATES THAT CURRENTLY ALLOW WIND DTC SHIPMENTS. WE HAD TO START SOMEWHERE AND FOR KENTUCKY THAT. POINT IN TIME WAS TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN. NOW ARE SOCIETY IS CLEARLY BEEN MOVED TO. DELAY FOR ALL SORTS OF ITEMS. DUE TO THE GROWTH OF AMAZON ANOTHER CONVENIENT SERVICES SO WE JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THAT TRADE REALLY CAME TO KENTUCKY WHERE MORE THAN SEVENTY PERCENT. OF OUR VISITORS TO THE KENTUCKY BOURBON TRAIL ARE FROM OUTSIDE THE STATE. THEREFORE THE NUMBER ONE QUESTION FROM OUR VISITORS IS WHY CAN'T I SHIP MY BOURBON HOME. SO THE KENTUCKY LEGISLATURE RESOLVED THAT PROBLEM IN TWENTY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. BY ALLOWING IN PERSON VISITORS TO DISTILLERIES TO SHIP A LIMITED NUMBER BOTTLES HOME. BUT WE QUICKLY LEARNED THAT ONLY A HANDFUL OF STATES ALLOWED SPIRITS SHIPMENTS. WHICH RESTRICTED OUR EFFORTS AND FRUSTRATED CONSUMERS. THE NEXT YEAR OUR FRIENDS AT THE WINE INSTITUTE ASKED KENTUCKY LAWMAKERS TO FINALLY OPEN OUR BORDERS TO WHINE IN SHIPMENTS. AND FULL ECOMMERCE WITHOUT THAT IN PERSON SALES. THIS ESCALATED DISCUSSIONS AND NEGOTIATIONS OVER DIRECT CONSUMER SHIPPING FOR NOT ONLY WINE BUT BEER AND SPIRITS. AND LEAD TO A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW- IN OUR LEGISLATURE INVOLVING ALL STAKEHOLDERS AS SEGMENTS OF THE THREE TIER SYSTEM JUST AS YOU'RE HAVING HERE TODAY. A BILL ALLOWING FULL DTC WAS FILED IN FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY AND ONLY PASSED BY THE KENTUCKY GENERAL ASSEMBLY A YEAR LATER. JUST AS YOU KNOW CONSUMERS RAMPED UP THEIR DEMAND FOR ALCOHOL SHIPPING AND DELIVERY AS THE PANDEMIC CLOSE RESTAURANTS BARS AND FORCE PEOPLE TO QUARANTINE AT HOME. YOU CAN CHECK THE LATEST UPDATED THE NEW ALL THIS YEAR TO ALLOW FOR FILMING CENTERS UPON THE REQUEST AGAIN FROM THE WINE INSTITUTE. AND A LARGE WINERIES THAT USE THEM TO EFFICIENTLY PROCESS SHIPMENTS. AND I SHOULD POINT OUT HERE THAT WE ENCOURAGE OUR WHOLESALE PARTNERS TO BECOME THE FILM CENTERS FOR DTC SHIPPING- IN KENTUCKY SINCE THEY ALREADY HAVE OUR PRODUCTS. BUT THEY DID THE CLIENT AND INSTEAD THEY THEY DID OPPOSE THE BILL. SO I'VE BEEN ASKED TO KIND OF QUICKLY EXPLAIN HOW KENTUCKY'S DID YOU SEE WHAT WORKS. AND IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO THE BILL THAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU. OUR DISTILLERS ALLOWED TO SHIP ONE CASE OF SPIRITS PER CONSUMER PER MONTH. WHILE WINERIES IN BEER CAN SPEECHES TEN CASES PER CONSUMER PER MONTH. BOTH IN STATE AND OUT OF STATE MANUFACTURERS MUST SUBMIT THEIR HOME STATES LICENSE IN ORDER TO GET A KENTUCKY SHIPPERS LICENSE. WHICH ONLY COST A HUNDRED DOLLARS. THEY'RE REQUIRED TO COLLECT AND REMIT ALL TAXES MONTHLY AND THEN SEND A REPORT OF ALL SHIPPING TRANSACTIONS QUARTERLY. TO OUR STATE DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE INTERSTATE EIGHTY C. ALL MANUFACTURERS MUST KEEP DETAILED SHIPPING RECORDS FOR AT LEAST FOUR YEARS. AND MAKE THEM AVAILABLE FOR AUDIT INSPECTION BY THE DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE AND THE ABC UPON REQUEST. COMMA CARRIERS LIKE ABC CAN ONLY SHIP FOR MANUFACTURERS TO HAVE THIS DIRECT APPROACH LIGHTS. THEY'RE REQUIRED TO UPDATE THAT LIST OF LICENSEES EVERY QUARTER AND STOP SHIPPING FOR ANY MANUFACTURER THAT DOES NOT MAINTAIN THEIR LICENSE. AND LIKE YOUR BILL EACH SHIPMENT MUST BE CLEARLY LABEL CONTAINS ALCOHOL SIGNATURE OF PERSON AGE TWENTY ONE OR OLDER REQUIRED FOR DELIVERY. AND OUR LAW ALSO REQUIRES DISTILLERS INCOMING CARRIERS TO CHECK A GOVERNMENT ISSUED ID SUCH AS A LIGHT DRIVER'S LICENSE UPON DELIVERY. SO HOW WAS THE T. C. WORKING IN KENTUCKY. WELL THE KENTUCKY ABC TODAY HAS ISSUED SIX HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN DIRECT STRIPPERS LICENSES SIX HUNDRED SEVEN THOSE ARE FROM OUT OF STATE MANUFACTURERS OF WHICH 75% ARE FROM CALIFORNIA. WE CURRENTLY HAVE ABOUT EIGHTY NINE KENTUCKY DISTILLERIES WINERIES AND BREWERIES THAT HAVE OBTAINED DIRECTION FIRST LICENSE. A LOT OF OUR KENTUCKY DISTILLERS ARE SHIPPING AGAIN STATE AND THE TARGETED AREAS LIKE WASHINGTON DC AS THEY LEARN HOW TO LEGALLY RESPONSIBLY NAVIGATE THE DTC PROCESS EITHER BY THEMSELVES OR THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY COMPIANCE SYSTEMS LIKE YOU HEARD SHIP COMPLIANT POOR SPIRITS THREE SIXTY. ARE BIGGER DISTILLERS HAVE RELIED ON CLUBS WITH SPECIALLY BOTTLES LIKE MAKER'S MARK WHICH S CREATED UNIQUE VARIATIONS OF ITS MAKER'S% MARK FORTY SIX BRAND USING THEIR WOOD FINISHING SERIES THAT HAS BEEN VERY POPULAR WITH CONSUMERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THANK SOME DISTILLERS QUITE FRANKLY- WAITING FOR MORE STATES TO PASS DTC LAWS HOPEFULLY LIKE CALIFORNIA BEFORE REALLY INVESTING IN THE STAFF IN THE PROCESS OF THE SHIP. ANY CRAP TO. OBVIOUSLY ARE USING THIS OPPORTUNITY TO MARKET THEIR BRANDS ESPECIALLY SINCE SOME SAILORS. DO NOT KERRY EVERY EXPRESSION THE DISTILLERY MAKES SAID YOU'RE YOU'RE GONNA HEAR FROM OPPONENTS ABOUT A LOSS OF TAX REVENUE IN PROBLEMS WITH RESPONSIBILITY. I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT'S NOT HAPPENING IN KENTUCKY I CHECKED IN YESTERDAY WITH OUR A. B. C. AND THE PARTNER REVENUE. AND THE DEPARTMENT REVIEW REPORTED THAT SHIPPERS ARE PAYING THEIR TAXES AND THEY'RE NOT AWARE OF ANY COMPLIANCE ISSUES AND THE SAME THING GOES FOR A. B. C. THEY SAID THEY HAVE NOT SEEN ANY PROBLEMS OR COMPLAINTS WITH TTC IN KENTUCKY. FINALLY LET ME WRAP UP AND SAY. THAT THE KDHE IN OUR MEMBERS DO STRONGLY SUPPORT THE PREACHER SYSTEM. BUT WE ALSO SUPPORT MEETING CONSUMERS DEMANDS. AND THAT'S WHERE THE DTC COMES INTO PLAY AS A COMPLEMENT TO THE EXISTING PRINTER SYSTEM. WE DON'T WE'VE SEEN AND HEARD ALL THE SCARE TACTICS DURING KENTUCKY. FROM OPPONENTS SOON JUST DON'T WANT TO CHANGE. AND AS WE POINTED OUT CALIFORNIA'S INCREDIBLE WINE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN SHIPPING FOR DECADES. WITH BARELY A PEEP OF OPPOSITION AND THE REALITY IS THE THREE TIER SYSTEM IS ALIVE AND WELL ACROSS THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. OUR DISTILLERS LIKE YOU'RE FINE WINERIES TAKE RESPONSIBILITY SERIOUSLY. OUR LICENSES AS THE DIMENSIONS ARE ON THE LINE. WE PARTNER KENTUCKY WAS STATE OF THE ART STATE OF THE ART DEVELOPERS LIKE INTELLICHECK. TO CHECK ID'S AND WE MIGHT SPONSOR SAFE RIDE PROGRAMS WITH LEFT ON MAJOR HOLIDAYS. THAT TAKE POTENTIAL DRUNK DRIVERS OFF THE ROADS. IN FACT OUR KENTUCKY D. C. LAW IS MUCH STRONGER ON ANY CHECKS. ON LICENSED RETAIL DISTILL DELIVERY SERVICES THAT ARE NOT REQUIRED BY STATUTE YOU CAN TAKE A CHECK ID'S UPON DELIVERY. AND THEY'RE EVEN ALLOWED TO USE UNDER A DRIVER TO PERSONALLY. DELIVER BOTTLES WITH LITTLE OR NO OVERSIGHT. SO WHEN YOU HEAR THE SUBSTANTIALLY CONCERNS ABOUT THINGS LIKE CONSOLIDATION OF THE STORE MANUFACTURERS. WHICH IS ALSO UNTRUE- YOU KNOW REMEMBER THERE ARE NOW OVER TWO THOUSAND DISTILLERS AND ALL FIFTY STATES. THEY'RE CREATING GOOD PAYING JOBS LOCAL BRANDS AND INVESTING IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. WE'RE GONNA HEAR ARGUMENTS ABOUT COMING HERE IS NEEDING MORE REPORTING. WHICH ALL THAT REALLY DOES IS CREATE AN UNNECESSARY BUREAUCRATIC RED TAPE AN ARTIFICIAL BARRIER TO DIRECT TO CONSUMER SHIPPING. THE KENTUCKY LAW PUTS THE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTING ON THOSE WHO KNOW WHAT IS BEING SHIPPED AND WHERE IT'S BEING SHIPPED. WHICH IS THE MANUFACTURER. AND WHEN IT COMES TO TAXES. YOU KNOW OUR OPPONENTS ARE STATING THAT THE STORY SOMEONE USUAL BREAK THE LAW. AND WILL REMIT TAXES THAT ARE OWED EVEN THOUGH WE'RE FOLLOWING THE SAME INTERSTATE PROCESS THAT AMAZON AND OTHER OUTLETS DUE TO COLLECT AND PAY TAXES. WE'VE ALSO HEARD ALLEGATIONS THAT WE'RE GONNA SHIP COUNTERFEIT PARK BROUGHT UP COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS. IN ROOM TWO HUNDRED YEARS OF CREDIBILITY AND GOODWILL. YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S QUITE FRANKLY OFFENSIVE TO US- BOTTLE PRODUCED BY DISTILLER WHICH IS BOTTLED AND SEALED AND THEN DELIVERED DIRECTLY TO CONSUMER. IS JUST AS SAFE AND HOW IT'S HANDLED TODAY. THE TRUTH IS THERE ARE LAWS ON THE BOOKS TO CATCH STOP LOSS AND CHRIS WE ALSO SUPPORT STRICTER ENFORCEMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY. OPPONENTS ARGUE THAT'S GONNA COST MORE BUT IT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO COST AS MUCH AS THE INCREASED BROCK PROCEED TO REVIEW BIRDS SOME COMIC EUROPEAN WORK THAT THEY OFTEN RECOMMEND. SO THE BOTTOM LINE FOR KENTUCKY IS DTC HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR DECADES THANKS IN LARGE PART TO YOUR ONE INDUSTRY. A CALIFORNIA STANDS TO BENEFIT MORE THAN ANY OTHER STATE. ACCORDING TO THE TTB CALIFORNIA LEADS THE NATION WITH NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED OPERATING PERMITS FOR DISTILLED SPIRITS PRODUCERS ABOUT OURS. THAT'S ALMOST FIVE TIMES AS MANY AS WE HAVE HERE IN KENTUCKY AND WE'VE BEEN DISTILLING FOR OVER TWO HUNDRED YEARS. WITH THE GROWTH AMERICAN SPIRITS ACROSS THE COUNTRY CONSUMERS ARE DEMANDING ACCESS TO PIONEERING NEW CRAFT BRANDS AS WELL AS INNOVATIVE EXPERIMENTAL AND PERSONAL SELECTIONS FROM LARGER DISTILLERS. SO AS THE CALIFORNIA ONE HISTORY HAS PROVEN SUCCESSFULLY TIME AND TIME AGAIN. ALCOHOL CAN BE SHIPPED RESPONSIBLY AND EFFECTIVELY WITH ALL TAXES PAID IN THE THREE TIER SYSTEM IT'S A LOT OF WELL. SO THANK YOU FROM KENTUCKY AND I'LL BE GLAD WHEN THE COUNCIL TO ENTRY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER GREGORY- AS A POINT OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE- I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO- GO ON A FIELD TRIP AND VISIT THE BOURBON TRAIL I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT- TO ANYBODY AND I THINK THAT YOU INDICATED IN YOUR TESTIMONY THAT- YOU'RE TRYING TO REPLICATE WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE CALIFORNIA. WINE INDUSTRY AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT- IMITATION IS THE HIGHEST FORM OF FLATTERY AND YOU'VE GOT A HELL OF A GOOD JOB BUT I REALLY ENJOYED IT VERY VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. SO AT THIS POINT IN TIME I'M GONNA CALL ON NATALIE SOLAR SO- CHILLERS- SKEWS ME THAT WITH THE CALIFORNIA CRAFT BREWERS ASSOCIATION- MISSED CHILDREN CHILLER WHOSE- SORRY FOR **** UP YOUR NAME YOU MAY BEGIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S MY USBAND'S FAULT SO GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- AS SENATOR DODD SAID- MY NAME IS NATALIE CHILLERS- AND I'M THE CO OWNER OF RUSSIAN RIVER BREWING COMPANY IN SANTA ROSA AND WINDSOR CALIFORNIA. IN CINEMA COUNTY- WHERE WE HAVE TO BREW PUBS WE SELF DISTRIBUTE WITHIN A ONE HUNDRED MILE RADIUS OF ARMORIES WE PARTNER WITH SIXTY THIRD PARTY WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTORS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE HAVE THREE OUT OF STATE ARMORIES BEEN IN BUSINESS SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN AND WE OPENED OUR FIRST BREWPUB IN DOWNTOWN SANTA ROSA IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR I ALSO RECENTLY SERVED NINE YEARS ON THE CALIFORNIA CRAFT BREWERS ASSOCIATION'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS. TWO OF THOSE AS BOARD CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE TODAY TO SHOW MY SUPPORT OF THE CALIFORNIA CRAFT BEER INDUSTRY IS ALREADY EXISTING PRIVILEGE ALLOWING BEER MANUFACTURERS TO SHIP DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. UNLIKE DISTILLED SPIRITS THIS IS A PRIVILEGE THAT BOTH REASON WINERIES HAVE ENJOYED IN CALIFORNIA FOR DECADES TODAY I AM REPRESENTING ALL CRAFT BREWERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA TO IMPRESS UPON YOU THE IMPORTANCE OF SHORING UP THIS EXISTING PRIVILEGE. THROUGH LEGISLATION TO HARMONIZE OUR STATE STATUTES WITH FEDERAL. LAWS HERE'S OUR STORY. IN EARLY MARCH TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. 51% OF OUR TOTAL COMPANY REVENUE WAS GENERATED THROUGH OUR TOO BUSY BREWPUBS IN CINEMA COUNTY FALL BARS RESTAURANTS AND STORES THROUGH SELF DISTRIBUTION AND OUR WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR PARTNERS HAVE ARE DISTRIBUTED BEERS RESULTING K. EGGS TO BARS AND RESTAURANTS. ON MARCH NINETEENTH GOVERNOR NEWSOM LIKE SO MANY OTHER GOVERNORS AND HEADS OF STATE IN THE UNITED STATES AND BEYOND ISSUED A MANDATORY STATE HOME ORDER AND SHUT DOWN ALL GROUP PUBS VERY TAPROOMS WINERY AND DISTILLERY TASTING ROOMS RESTAURANTS AND BARS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. SUDDENLY BOTH OF OUR BREWPUBS WENT DARK AND WE WERE FORCED TO FURLOUGH ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO EMPLOYEES EVERY BAR AND RESTAURANT TO HIM WE AND OUR WHOLESALERS DELIVERED BEER WERE GONE IN AN INSTANT AND EVERY TANK OF BOTH PARISE WAS COMPLETELY FULL. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE PENICK SAID AND IMMEDIATELY HOW ARE WE GOING TO MAKE OUR MASSIVE LOAN PAYMENTS WHAT WE HAVE TO DUMP ALL OF THAT BEER DOWN THE DRAIN WE'RE GOING TO LOSE EVERYTHING WE HAVE WORKED SO HARD TO BUILD. BUT IF WE ARE GOING TO LOSE IT ALL WE WEREN'T GOING DOWN WITHOUT A FIGHT MY HUSBAND DANNY SUGGESTED WE STARTED SELLING MORE BEER ONLINE DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA. WHICH WAS SOMETHING WE HAD DONE ON A LIMITED BASIS SINCE WE OPENED OUR FIRST PROPOSED EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO WE HAD ABOUT EIGHTEEN HUNDRED CASES OF OUR FLAGSHIP DOUBLE IPA PLINY THE ELDER AND DOG A BLIND PIG IPA THE REMARKS ARE NOW CLOSED GROUP HUBS ALTHOUGH WE ONLY HAD ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SHIPPING BOXES ON HAND NO LABEL PRINTERS AND ABSOLUTELY ZERO EXPERIENCE SELLING HIGH VOLUMES OF ANYTHING ONLINE. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GREAT IDEA TO MAKE ALL EIGHTEEN HUNDRED CASES AVAILABLE IN OUR ONLINE STORE I WASN'T COMPLETELY SOLD ON THE IDEA BUT AGREED ONCE YOU CONVINCE ME THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO BUY MORE SHIPPING BOXES IF NEEDED. SO I ADDED BOTH YOUR STORE ONLINE STORE MADE A POST ON SOCIAL MEDIA WE SAT THERE. AND WATCHED ORDER START TRICKLING IN. THEN THEY WERE ROLLING IN ST ONE HUNDRED CASES WERE SOLD DOWN TO. CASE BY THE TIME WE WENT TO BUY THAT NIGHT WE WERE OUT TO ABOUT TWO HUNDRED. I WAS GETTING WORRIED ABOUT NOT HAVING ENOUGH SHIPPING BOXES AND SEE JUST TO PULL IT DOWN. REALLY CONVINCED ME NOT REALLY. THAT HE WOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM FINDING MORE BOXES SO I WISH HIM GOOD LUCK AND WENT TO BED. THE NEXT MORNING TO REMOVE BOTH BEERS FROM OUR ONLINE STORE AFTER SELLING MORE THAN FIFTEEN HUNDRED CASES. OF COURSE WE SPENT THE NEXT WEEK SCRAMBLING TO FIND AS MANY SHIPPING BOXES BECAUSE- SO HAVING THE ABILITY TO IMMEDIATELY CHANGE OUR BUSINESS MODEL IN A MATTER OF DAYS TO INCLUDE. DIRECT TO CONSUMER SHIPPING OF BEER THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT LITERALLY SAVED US DURING KIND OF IT WAS THE LIFELINE WE NEEDED TO HELP FINANCIALLY GET THROUGH THE MOST DIFFICULT AND DARKEST OF TIMES. DIRECT TO CONSUMER ALSO SAVED HUNDREDS OF SMALL WORRIES FROM GOING OUT OF BUSINESS DURING THE PANDEMIC WHEN THEIR TAPROOMS AND BREWPUBS WERE COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN. THOUSANDS OF SMALL BREWERIES AROUND THE COUNTRY RELY PRIMARILY ON WHAT'S CALLED ON PREMISE SALES. FOR THEIR TAPROOMS BREWPUBS AND ONLINE. IT ALSO GAVE US AND OTHER BREWERIES THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE JOBS FOR EMPLOYEES. WHO WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN LAID OFF. ANOTHER BRIGHT SPOT IN OUR TOTAL SWITCH TO DIRECT TO CONSUMER WERE ALL VERY NICE COMMENTS AND MESSAGES WE RECEIVE FROM CONSUMERS. LETTING US KNOW HOW ORDERING OUR BEER ONLINE WE'LL START GOING HOME WITH SOMETHING THEY REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO. THAT BOX OF OUR BEER SHOWING UP ON THEIR DOORSTEP WAS. IN SOME SMALL BUT MEANINGFUL WAY HELPING THEM GET THROUGH COVERAGE. WE CONTINUE TO SELL BOTTLES AND CANS ONLINE WEEKLY THROUGHOUT TWENTY TWENTY. INCLUDING OUR EVER POPULAR PLAN FOR PRESIDENT A DOUBLE DRY HOPPED DOUBLE IPA IN A CAN TO COMMEMORATE THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. I EVEN KNOW OF A FEW STATE LEGISLATORS ABOUT. LINE FOR PRESIDENT ONLINE TO. DIRECT AGAINST WENT FOR LESS THAN PERCENT OF OUR TIME OVER COME REVENUE 12% BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY. WHILE WHOLESALE SALES TO DISTRIBUTORS. INCREASED FROM 49% TO FIFTY EIGHT PERCENT. THANKFULLY LIMITED OPERATIONS IN OUR GROUP PUBS ALSO ALLOWED US TO MAINTAIN SOME ON SITE SALES. YOU MIGHT BE ASKING RIGHT NOW BUT WHAT ABOUT YOUR WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTORS. DOESN'T DIRECT TO CONSUMERS CUT INTO THEIR PROFITS WITH CUSTOMERS HAVING THE ABILITY TO ORDER DIRECTLY FROM YOU. AND NOT HAVE TO GO TO THE STORE. BY PASSING THE THREE TIER SYSTEM ALL TOGETHER. ONE WOULD THINK THIS TO BE THE CASE BUT THE EXACT OPPOSITE IS TRUE. YOU IN APRIL AND SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THE FIRST FULL SIX MONTHS OF THE PANDEMIC. WHEN IT WOULD DRAMATICALLY AFFECTED OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS SALES AND CHART CALIFORNIA WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTORS ALONE. NOT INCLUDING OUT OF STATE WHOLESALERS OR SOMEHOW STOCKS STOCK DISTRIBUTION. WERE UP 63% OVER TWENTY NINETEEN AND KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY BOTTLED BEER WHICH IS MORE PROFITABLE. TO US AND WHOLESALERS THEN KAY. NOW THAT OUR BUSINESSES ARE MOSTLY RE OPENED AND YOUR CONSUMERS HAVE MORE OPTIONS FOR PLACES TO BUY AND CONSUME CRAFT BEER. DIRECT TO CONSUMER CONTINUES TO REMAIN AN IMPORTANT AND VIABLE PART OF OURS AND OTHER BREWERIES OVERALL BUSINESS. THERE'S A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY TO REACH NEW CUSTOMERS IN AREAS WHERE WE ARE NOT YET DISTRIBUTED. AND DIRECT TO CONSUMERS A GREAT MARKETING TOOL TO ATTRACT AND MAINTAIN LOYAL CUSTOMERS. WERE THEN ABLE TO BUY OUR BEER AND BARS STORES AND RESTAURANTS. THUS HELPING TO BUILD OUR BRANDS INCREASED DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. DIRECT TO CONSUMER IS ALSO A GREAT WAY TO SELL BEERS ONLINE THAT ARE NOT AVAILABLE AT ALL FOR DISTRIBUTION. SUCH AS ALL OF OUR CANNED BEERS AND SPECIALTY ONE OFF SMALL BATCH BREWS. THE FEEDBACK FROM CUSTOMERS HAS BEEN OVERWHELMINGLY POSITIVE. NOW THAT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO PURCHASE ARE HARD TO FIND BEERS. IT IS ALSO THE ONLY WAY WE ARE ABLE TO MAINTAIN OUR BEER CLUBS AND SUCH A GEOGRAPHICALLY LARGE STATE. AND WAS. A SAFE WAY TO DELIVER THOSE. I'M DURING THE COUNTDOWN. THIS IS WORKING TO PRINT THIS. PRIVILEGE FOR THE INTRODUCTION TWO BILL. SB FIVE ONE SEVEN REQUIRE AN SP SIX TWO ZERO ALAN WHICH WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING. THESE BILLS WILL HARMONIZE OUR STATE STATUTES WITH EXISTING FEDERAL LAWS. THUS AVOIDING DISRUPTION TO THIS VERY IMPORTANT PRIVILEGE FOR CALIFORNIA CACKERS. THANK YOU AGAIN MISTER CHAIR AND FELLOW COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR ALLOWING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. AND ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND THE REST OF THE PANEL AND WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MYSTERIES OF APPRECIATE YOUR- PRESENTATION- WE HAVE QUESTIONS- FREDDY THE PANEL MEMBERS. I'M NOT. SURE RUBIO THANK YOU JUST A CLARIFYING QUESTION- YOU KNOW I REALLY AM. I'M JUST THANKFUL THAT YOU WERE ABLE TO CONTINUE N. DOT BE ABLE TO KEEP ALL THOSE FOLKS EMPLOYED BECAUSE AT THE EXEMPTION CAN SOMEONE HELP- LET ME KNOW WHEN IS THE EXEMPTION. CONCLUDED WHEN IS THIS GOING TO TERMINATE. YEAH WITH THE NEW YEAR YEAH. BY THE END OF THIS YEAR IS THAT WHAT THE ANSWERS. OKAY THAT'S IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR WELL VERSED THANK YOU MR CHAIR- JUST MISTER VILLA CON AND NOT A QUESTION A COMMENT YET IN MY CABINET HOME IS YEAR CUCUMBER VODKA WHICH IS REALLY QUITE REFRESHING SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR PRODUCING THAT IT'S ONE OF MY WIFE'S FAVORITES. IN TERMS OF QUESTIONS- THE GOVERNMENT FOR MISTER GREGORY HE TALKED ABOUT HOW THERE'S TWO THOUSAND DISTILLERIES ACROSS AMERICA A MORNING IF THIS WENT INTO EFFECT IT WILL IF THIS WOULD AFFECT WHOLESALERS IN ANY WAY AND BEING-ABLE TO CARRY EVERY BRAND AND- VARIETAL IN ANY GEOGRAPHIC REGION THE UNITED STATES SAID IT MIGHT BE A SPECIAL BOTTLE THAT CONSUMERS ARE LOOKING FOR IS IT WITH THERE WERE TO BE ANY. IMPEDIMENT TO THAT. I'M I'M TO TRYING TO FOLLOW YOUR QUESTION SO IF. YOU'RE SAYING IF IT OPENED UP TO ALL. TO PRECLUDE ANY WHOLESALER FROM BEING ABLE TO OFFER ANY PARTICULAR PRODUCT NO. NOPE NOT NOT EVEN ON OUR OPINION I MEAN ONE OF THE YOU KNOW BUT AS WAS MENTIONED ABOUT THE WINE INDUSTRY DO THE CONSUMERS ARE LOOKING FOR- YOU KNOW SPECIALTY BOTTLES- IN DIFFERENT EXPRESSIONS AND THINGS LIKE THAT- WHICH WE HAVE PLENTY OF HERE IN KENTUCKY SO- THAT'S NOT GONNA STOP US FROM YOU KNOW PUTTING THOSE BOTTLES OUT TO WHOLESALERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND RETAILERS EITHER. I GOT A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS FOR YOU I MEANT TO ASK ANOTHER ONE FOR SOMEBODY ELSE BUT THAT'S OKAY AS THE GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GRANDSON OF DANIEL BOONE I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT SUPPORT TACKY I FOUND THAT OUT LAST YEAR REALLY PRETTY INTERESTING SO YOU MENTIONED THAT THAT THAT THE BIG BOURBON PRODUCERS HAVE HAVE- CLUB SO I'M ASSUMING THAT LIKE WINE CLUBS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. RIGHT YES. I DO THIS DO THE SMALLER. OFFER THE SAME OPPORTUNITY AS WELL. MANY OF THEM ARE YOU KNOW IT AND AGAIN THIS IS SUCH AS AT AND EARLY ENDEAVOR. INDUSTRY I'M SORRY YEAH IT'S AN EARLY INTEREST YOU UNDERSTAND THAT EARLY JUST RESET MOST OF THEM ARE SHIPPING YOU KNOW BOTTLES THAT- THERE THE RETAILERS TYPICALLY DON'T CARRY THE HOPES ARE STILL KERRY WHERE IS THE LARGEST STORIES- YOU KNOW NOBODY'S GOING TO BUY A BOTTLE OF REGULAR MAKERS MAC BY RICK REGULAR BALLOT MAKER'S MARK AND HAVING IT SHIPPED IN PAPER SIPPING AWAY TWO WEEKS TO GET IT WHEN THEY GO TO THEIR LOCAL LIQUOR STORE GET IT. ENJOYED IMMEDIATELY- SO THE BIGGEST SOURCE FOR MOST OF LOOKING AT CLUBS RIGHT NOW OKAY THAT WAS MY NEXT QUESTION SO PEOPLE ARE NOT BUYING SOMETHING THAT I COULD I COULD GO TO THE LIQUOR STORE OR COSCO OR WHATEVER THEY'RE THEY'RE BUYING SPECIALTY BLENDS CORRECT RIGHT RIGHT SO FAR YES. AND AGAIN WE DON'T ANTICIPATE IT HAVING AN EFFECT ON THE REGULAR BRANDS YOU CAN GET IN JOY- BECAUSE JUST FOR CONVENIENCE PURPOSES AND FOR COST PURPOSES WHY WOULD YOU- AGAIN GO PAY ME TO PAY MORE AND WAIT. TO HAVE IT SHIPPED WHEN YOU CAN GO TO YOUR LOCAL PACKAGE STORE GET IT IMMEDIATELY GREAT THANK. YOU SO MUCH- THANK YOU. THE QUESTION MR GRADY COMING YOUR WAY A COUPLE OF MAYBE. IN YOUR EXPERIENCE TO KENTUCKY DISTILLERS. SHIP MAINLY TO CONSUMERS IN KENTUCKY. OR TO OTHER STATES THAT ALLOW DTC I JUST DIDN'T REALLY. GET I THINK YOU COMMENT ON THAT BUT I DIDN'T REALLY FALL. RIGHT NOW IT'S MOSTLY CONSUMERS IN KENTUCKY IN A FEW SELECT IN STATES WHERE IT'S EASY TO SHIP BECAUSE AS MR OSCAR MENTION THERE'S ONLY. ELEVEN STATES INCLUDING DC THAT ALLOW SOME FORM DTC SHIPPING SO- WE'RE STILL TRYING TO WORK THROUGH I KNOW THE- THE RED TAPE IN THE LICENSING EVERYTHING ELSE ALL OF THOSE STATES- THAT- YOU KNOW AND WE HOPE TO HAVE MORE- SO RIGHT NOW A LOT OF WE'RE DOING KENTUCKY ONLY JUST TO KIND OF. WORK OUT THE BUGS. IN DC IN ALASKA IN SOME OTHER PLACES LIKE THAT BUT WE WOULD HOPE TO SHIP MORE YOU KNOW IT'S MORE STATES COME ONLINE. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND THEN ALSO ARE THERE ANY LIMITATIONS ON HOW MANY BOTTLES EACH DISTILLER. KINSHIP IN KENTUCKY. AND YOU SEE IF THERE ARE DO YOU THINK THOSE LIMITATIONS ARE WORKING FOR MOST DISTILLERS. YES SO. THE SOURCING A TECHIE YOU CAN SHIP. UP TO TEN BOTTLES PER CUSTOMER PER MONTH- AND THAT WOULD BE THE SAME COMING INTO KENTUCKY- UNDER A WALL- WINERIES AND BREWERIES CAN SHIP UP TO TEN CASES. PER CUSTOMER PER MONTH. AND SO FAR I HAVEN'T HEARD ANY COMPLAINTS FROM ANYBODY ABOUT THOSE LIMITS MISS CHILLAR SO- ARE ARE THERE ANY CONCERNS THAT ALLOWING OUT OF STATE BREWERS TO SHIP INTO CALIFORNIA CAN HURT CROP GROWERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ALL I DON'T BELIEVE SO- IT'S VERY IT'S PRETTY COST PROHIBITIVE TO SHIP OUT OF STATE- YOU KNOW FOR US FOR EXAMPLE WE DID START LOOKING INTO SHIPPING TO THE STATE OF NEVADA BECAUSE BECAUSE IT HAS SOME- SOME. DIRECTION BEING LAWS THAT ALLOW CALIFORNIA BURRIS TO SHIP TO NEVADA ONCE WE STARTED TO GO DOWN THAT RABBIT HOLE WE REALIZE THAT IT WOULD BE REALLY REALLY EXPENSIVE TO SHIP TO NEVADA EVEN JUST YOUR RENO- THERE'S ALSO SOME CRAZY STATE LAWS THAT WOULD ONLY ALLOW US TO SHIP LIKE EIGHT A HALF BOTTLES PER PERSON SO GENERALLY IN ANY SENSE FOR US TO DO IT- BUT YOU DID IT DID END UP BEING PRETTY EXPENSIVE LIKE FOR EXAMPLE I THINK THERE'S SOME LEGISLATION GOING IN HAWAII. RIGHT NOW- TO ALLOW- DIRECTORSHIP TO CONSUMER SHIPPING THERE AND WE HAVE FRIENDS THAT LIVE ON QUIET AND WHENEVER WE SEND THEM YOU KNOW CASE OF BEER FOR SOMETHING- IT'S LIKE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS SO I DON'T REALLY FORESEE. THAT BEING- HUGE ISSUE JUST NUMBER ONE IT'S COST PROHIBITIVE AND NUMBER TWO- YOU KNOW WE HAVE MADE GREAT BEER IN CALIFORNIA SO I'M NOT I'M NOT TOO WORRIED ABOUT THE COMPETITION WE ALSO HAVE FORTY MILLION PEOPLE IN OUR STATES WE HAVE QUITE A LARGE BEER DRINKING POPULATION TO ABSORB A LITTLE BIT MORE SO I'M I'M NOT TOO WORRIED ABOUT IT. THANK YOU MISTER VILLA CONDO SAME QUESTION FOR YOU IN THE- CRAFT DISTILLERS. FROM FROM THAT STANDPOINT. YEAH I KNOW I WOULD TO CONCUR. IN AND BE ON THE Y. SIDE WE HAVE THE TO SHIP WINES- SO BASICALLY I'M VIRTUALLY EVERY STATE AND IN THE UNITED STATES. AND IT DOES COME DOWN TO COST AND YOU KNOW EACH STATE HAS DIFFERENT SET OF REGULATIONS I'M SOME REQUIRE BONDS- ANNUAL LICENSES REPORTING. AND UNLESS YOU ACTUALLY HAVE YOU KNOW ENOUGH CUSTOMERS IN EACH STATE YOU CAN MAKE THAT DECISION IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR ME TO I SAW THAT BUT TO. GET A LICENSE TO SELL IN THAT STATE AND A LOT OF TIMES IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE UNLESS YOU HAVE A REALLY BIG CUSTOMER BASE- I'M ASSUMING THE SAME THING IS WHEN PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE SHIPPING TO CALIFORNIA. AND YOU KNOW FOR US. WE HAVE THE BENEFIT OF WE HAVE THE AGRITOURISM PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE COMING HERE- THEY'RE GONNA BE VISITING THE DISTILLERS. VISITING BIRDS VISITING WINERIES AND THEN THEY BASICALLY THEY WANT TO BASICALLY GET IT WHEN THEY GO BACK HOME AND SO IF ANYTHING I THINK IT GIVES US THE ADVANTAGE- TO BASICALLY OPEN UP SHIPPING OUT GOING BOTH WAYS- BECAUSE- FOR US. IT'LL GIVE THE SMALL CRAFT DISTILLERS CROPPERS I CRAFT WINERIES AND THEIR ABILITY TO BASICALLY HAVE A MUCH BIGGER MARKET- AND CALIFORNIA AGRITOURISM. YOU KNOW IT'S ALREADY ESTABLISHED AND SO I THINK IT'S A IT'S A REAL BENEFIT- I IT'S NOTHING THAT I THINK IS A SMALL DISTILLER. I'M AFRAID I THINK YOU KNOW IT LIKE IN THE WIND IS STREET I YOU KNOW THERE'S BRANDS OF ALL SIZES- AND YOU KNOW. THAT THE SAYING IN INDUSTRIES YOU KNOW THE RISING TIDE RAISES ALL BOATS AND SO I THINK THE SMALL DISTILLER AND THAT THE LARGEST DEALER CAN ALL WORK TOGETHER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND US SENATOR RUBIO- YEAH CALL EARLIER TO I THINK I MR FOR KENTUCKY- DISCUSS A BILL THAT YOU HELPED I BELIEVE IN FEBRUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY KENTUCKY AND YOU TALKED ABOUT LIKE THE COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW PROCESS AT THREE TIERS DO YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION YOU CAN JUST FORWARD TO WHAT THE COMMITTEE I'M SORRY WE DON'T RECEIVE ANY INFORMATION FOR THIS COMMITTEE BUT IF WE CAN MAKE SURE WE GET THAT INFORMATION SO WE CAN REVIEW AND- AND JUST YOU KNOW EXPLORE A LITTLE FURTHER I WOULD APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU. ABSOLUTELY PERFECT- I WAS GETTING S. SENATOR BOONE- I MEAN SENATOR WILK- TO SEE IF HE COULD- PIE BUT HE'S APPARENTLY LEFT THE MEETING TEMPORARILY I KNOW THAT HE HAD ANOTHER APPOINTMENT- WE GOT TO BE A LITTLE LIGHT HEARTED AROUND HERE- BUT NOW I DID HAVE- AND. EXCUSE ME A SECOND HERE. OKAY MISTER OZ GO YOU'RE STILL WITH US SIR I GUESS I AM ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOUR ORGANIZATION IS MADE UP OF BOTH BIG AND SMALL DISTILLERS DO YOU THINK DIRECT TO CONSUMER SHIPPING CAN BE GOOD FOR BOTH. I CERTAINLY YOU HAVE SOME OF THE LARGE TRADITIONAL DISTILLERS THAT EVEN THOUGH MANY OF THEIR BRANDS- PROBABLY WOULD NOT BE SHIPPED DIRECT BECAUSE THE PRICE POINT. THEY ALSO HAVE A LOT OF LINE EXTENSIONS AND HIGHER END BRANDS THAT- YOU KNOW WHEN WE LOOK AT THOSE PRODUCTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY GOING DIRECT TO CONSUMER SHIPPING THEY AVERAGE ABOUT FORTY FIVE DOLLARS PER BOTTLE. THAT'S ABOUT TRIPLE THE AVERAGE- RETAIL PURCHASE OF A BOTTLE OF SPIRITS. SO THEY CERTAINLY HAVE THOSE HIGHER END BRANDS THAT THEY WOULD BE INTERESTED IN SHIPPING- YOU KNOW THEY CERTAINLY HAVE- SPECIALLY BOTTLES BOTTLE SPECIAL BOTTLINGS THAT THEY THEY WOULD LIKE TO SHIP- AND THEN OF COURSE THE CRAFT DISTILLERS DATE ALSO- YOU KNOW THEY SIMPLY WANT MARKET ACCESS- IN MANY CASES YOU KNOW. YOU ASK MISTER GREGORY EARLIER- IF THE PRODUCTS WOULD IF ANY PRODUCTS SHIPPED DIRECT WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE TO- WHOLESALERS ALSO PRACTICAL MATTER A LOT OF SMALL CRAFT. DISTILLERS COMPLAIN IF I HAVE A HARD TIME BEATING GETTING A WHOLESALER- TO GET THEIR PRODUCTS AND THEN EVEN IF THEY CAN THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'RE THE WHOLESALER DOESN'T GET THEIR PRODUCT. THEIR PRODUCTS TO THE PROPER TIME AND ATTENTION. YEP SO AS A RESULT THE LARGE. RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WELL I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE SPEAKERS THAT- JOINED US FOR THIS PARTICULAR ANEL VERY INFORMATIVE- WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE TIME AND ATTENTION YOU PUT INTO THIS AT THIS TIME WE MOVED OUT OF THE LAST PANEL WILL BEGIN WITH HELLO HEATHER KALLIO WITH THE WINE AND SPIRITS WHOLESALERS. OF AMERICA. MISS KELLY ARE YOU HERE WITH US. YES GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- I'M GOING TO JUST SHARE. MY SCREEN REALLY QUICKLY OUR PRESENTATION- THANK YOU AGAIN- AS NOTED MY NAME IS HEATHER KALLIO I'M THE SENIOR DIRECTOR OF THE WINE AND SPIRITS WHOLESALERS OF AMERICA- I AM HEARING THIS AFTERNOON TO DISCUSS THIS VERY COMPLEX ISSUE- AND APPRECIATE THE TIME- GIVEN TO US TO. ADD YOUR WALK THROUGH THIS- WE WELCOME THAT OPPORTUNITY- AND WE'D LIKE TO DISCUSS HOW CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT MARKET PLACE IS SAFETY PERSON COMPETITIVE- UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM WHOLESALERS IN THE STATE PROVIDED MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND JOBS THE FEELING UNNECESSARY ROLE AS A KEY COMPONENT. OF THE SYSTEM. WHICH ENSURES EFFICIENT TAX COLLECTION A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR BUSINESSES OF ALL SIZES AND ACCOUNTABLE BUSINESS PRACTICES TO PREVENT UNDERAGE ACCESS ANOTHER PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUES. POLICY UNDER CONSIDERATION TODAY WOULD CREATE MORE REGULATORY BURDENS- UNDER MY NOSE BALANCE. OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY BENEFITS AND INCREASES- SPENDING FOR OUR REGULATORS AND STATE. MOST IMPORTANTLY- THAT THERE ARE OTHER MARKETPLACE OPTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO BUSINESSES INTO CONSUMERS JUST AWESOME DISNEY- WST WAY AND ARE ON LOCAL WHOLESALER PARTNERS WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THE pMEMBERS OF THE INDUSTRY I WANT RESPECT. HUMAN NEEDS ARE SMARTER REGULATIONS- CALIFORNIA WHOLESALERS- HOW ARE BIRDS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES- THANK YOU RESPONSIBILITY SERIOUSLY I AM AT WORK WITH THEIR ART SUPPLIER IN REGIONAL PARTNERS TO ACCOMPLISH THESE GOALS I WE TOOK A LOT OF PRIDE IN THE BRAND BUILDING AND MARKETING THIS IS DONE TO BRING SOME OF THESE WONDERFUL PRODUCTS TO MARKET- AND THEN TO WORK WITH OUR RETAIL PARTNERS TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS SOLD OUT RESPONSIBLY AND THERE'S MINE ESTATE FOR REGULATORS WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT IN THIS INDUSTRY CONSIDERING THAT ALCOHOL IS NOT LIKE ANY OF THOSE OTHER PRODUCTS THAT YOU WOULD FIND ON AMAZON NOT. YOU KNOW THE PAPER IT'S NOT SNEAKERS IT IS A NON TOXIC AND WE DO TEND TO TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF HAVING THESE STATE BASED SYSTEM- WHERE YOU HAVE ACCESS TO SOME OF THOSE BUSINESSES TO MAKE SURE THEY. ARE IN COMPLIANCE- THE JOBS THAT ARE SUPPORT. BY OUR- YOU KNOW MASSIVE IMPACT CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY- DISTRIBUTORS CONTRIBUTE TO BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. TO THE OVERALL ECONOMIC IMPACT AND WE PARTNER WITH- YOU KNOW UNION UNION PARTNERS THE TEAMSTERS TO. PROMOTE AND PROTECT YOU OVER TEN THOUSAND. IN STATE JOBS THIS IS A REALLY REALLY- YOU KNOW. EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT NUMBERS EARLIER. BUT I TEND TO THINK THEY'RE IMPORTANT THEY'RE NOT SCARY THESE ARE REAL NUMBERS THESE ARE REAL BUSINESS SENSE- THAT REAL JOBS ARE SUPPORTED. THESE FAMILIES AREN'T BAD. STABLE SALARIES- AND I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THIS SHOULD TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION. WE NOW- AS WELL THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM WORKS IT IS STATE ITS DIVERSE IN ITS COMPETITIVE AND IT WORKS FOR ALL MEMBERS OF THE HELPS A LOT OF SUPPLIERS- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK THIS AFTERNOON ABOUT THE EXPLOSIVE GROWTH OF OUR- DISTILLERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THAT'S HAPPENED WITHIN THE THREE TIER SYSTEM AND THAT'S HAPPENED FOR. AVS BECAUSE THESE ARE REGULATIONS ENSURE THAT HERE'S A PREDICTABLE MARKET PLACE WHERE YOU CAN GROW UP DISCUSSED- THAT THEIR TRADE PRACTICE REGULATIONS THAT ARE- THAT ARE ENFORCED AND RESPECTED SO THAT YOU KNOW YOU A LARGE SUPPLIER CAN'T FORCE OUT OF SMALLER SUPPLIER THE- SHELF SPACE THANKS THANKS TO THAT NATURE. ALL THAT DOES JUST APPEAR WHEN YOU GET INTO THAT DTC MARKET PLACE- IT BECOMES A LOT HARDER TO ENFORCE THEM AND HONESTLY IT'S NOT FEASIBLE FOR AID YOUR NAVY STREET APARTMENT IN A STATE THAT WAS BUILT TO ENFORCE THE FINITE NUMBER STATE LICENSEES. TO START HAVING TO POLICE YOU KNOW FORTY NINE OTHER STATES IN DC IS BUSINESSES ARE. REALLY HARD TO MAKE THAT REACH- BUT WE KNOW THAT IN CALIFORNIA THE WAY THAT THINGS ARE STRUCTURED THEY JUST WORK- AND THAT IF THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT. I HAD TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION. I DIRECT TO CONSUMER- YOU KNOW IF ABOUT IT FROM A LOT OF DIFFERENT TODAY AND I REALLY DO AGAIN WE DO APPRECIATE THIS HONEST AND OPEN CONVERSATION BECAUSE I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. THAT THIS ISSUE DOES GET SOME YOU KNOW SOME AIR TIME SOME DISCUSSION- BUT THERE'S A LOTTHAT GOES ON IN THESE DISCUSSIONS THAT. AND IT TENDS TO GET OVERSIMPLIFIED. THE FACT IS IT'S NOT A VERY SIMPLE ISSUE- THIS COUNTRY- IN EVERY SINGLE STATE HAS HAD A YOU KNOW THEIR STRUGGLES WITH ALCOHOL AS THE PRODUCT HOW IT SHOULD BE SOLD WHEN IT SHOULD BE SOLD. WHAT CAN BE SOLD ARE YOU ALL EVERY SINGLE QUESTION AND- AND THOSE THOSE QUESTIONS ARE ABOUT IT FOR A LONG TIME WE'VE SETTLED ON A SYSTEM THAT DOES WORK. OTHER THREE TIER SYSTEM IT HAS A LOT OF BENEFITS FOR THE INDUSTRY AND FOR CONSUMERS- SO. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SAY THAT YOU HAVE TO KNOCK IT DOWN. FOUR YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE TODAY IS NOT A VERY HONEST. LOOK AT YOU KNOW AT WHAT THE SITUATION REALLY YES. I DID YOU SEE DOESN'T COEXIST WITH A THREE TIER SYSTEM IT'S AN END RUN AROUND. ALL I CANNOT SCARE TACTICS BUT I WILL GET INTO SOME OF THE DATA LATER. ON IT. THE EXISTENCE OF DIRECT TO CONSUMER- OUTSIDE OF THAT STATE REGULATORY SYSTEM IT DOES DIRECTLY UNDERMINE THE ADVOCACY AND BENEFITS OF. OF EVERY. EVERYONE WHO IS PARTICIPATING IN THAT SYSTEM RIGHT ALL OF THAT PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY BENEFITS THAT YOU SEE- FROM THOSE IN ST THAT'S- ALSO UNDERMINES A LOT OF YOU KNOW LOCAL RETAILERS. NOT JUST THE WHOLESALERS BUT ALSO THE RETAILERS. IF A PRODUCT IS COMING IN FROM OUT OF STATE ON REGULATED. THERE IS NO WAY TO ENFORCE THOSE PRICECONTROLS OR ANYTHING ELSE AND PRODUCT APPROVALS THAT THAT YOU KNOW IN ANY STATE. YES SIR THESE ARE. ISSUES IT ALSO DOES TAKE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF RESOURCES TO HELP POLICE EFFECTIVELY REGULATE. RESOURCES THAT REALLY. WEREN'T DEDICATED NOTHER WE ISSUE YOU KNOW POLICE EDUCATION OR. EFFECTIVE REGULATION OF. STATE OWNED- BRING LICENSEE ACROSS LICENSE AND- R. ONE THANK YOU AT W. AUSTIN WAY ALL OF OUR STATE TO SEIZE ALL OF OUR PARTNERS WE ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON SEEKING SOLUTIONS WE KNOW THAT THE MARKETPLACE IS CHANGING AND E-COMMERCE IS HERE AND WE'VE GONE AHEAD IN THE RACE THAT WE WANT TO BE PART OF THAT- BUT DIRECT TO CONSUMER IS NOT THE ONLY E. COMMERCE SOLUTION I THINK IT'S REALLY REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT DISCUSSION TO HAVE HERE. WITH THIS PANEL- AND WE'LL CONTINUE THAT. AS AS I GO ON- BUT WE STRONGLY SUPPORT AFFECTIVE STATE REGULATORY SYSTEMS OR FOR ALL SALES OF ALCOHOL- WE DO REJECT THE IDEA THAT JUST ASSEMBLY OF EFFECTIVE REGULATORY OVERSIGHT IS NECESSARY FOR CONSUMER CONVENIENCE AND WE DO SUPPORT COMPLIANT CONVENIENT OPTIONS LIKE LOCAL LICENSE RETAILER DELIVERY INSTEAD OF INTERSTATE SHIPPING. AGAIN WE DO THINK THAT THE DATE I WHICH I WILL GET INTO NOT AS A SCARE TACTIC BUT BECAUSE THE DATA THAT USED TO MATTER IN THIS ARGUMENT- I WILL GET INTO THAT LATER WE HAVE TO BE A THREE WAY ALL ALONG WITH OUR STUDENT ASSOCIATION. HAS ISSUED- MULTIPLE SETS OF GUIDANCE ON STATE INSPECTED. I COMPU COMMERCE SOLUTIONS SUCH AS DELIVERY- WE ARE YOU KNOW WE SEE A LOT OF SUCCESS WITH THAT AROUND THE COUNTRY AND KNOW THAT THAT IS REALLY WHAT IS BEST FOR. YOUR CONSUMERS IN THE MARKETPLACE OVERALL- AS FAR AS INNOVATION ON THE WHOLESALE CHEER TO- TO ANSWER YOU KNOW SOME OF THE INCREASED NEEDS WITH- A LOT OF THESE PRACTICE DEALERS THAT ARE POPPING UP ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. YOU KNOW THE WHOLE SHELTER HAS INTEGRATED- BUSINESS SUCH AS COLLECTIVE EXPATS WHICH REACHES 50% OF THE U. S. MARKET PLACE AND CARRIES TEN THOUSAND PRODUCTS IN. THERE AS IS DOWN THE ROAD STATE DISTRIBUTION FOR ALL OUR LIVES IT IS A MEMBER OF W. S. TO BE WAYNE'S BASED IN CALIFORNIA AND IT PROVIDES INNOVATIVE WHOLESALE SOLUTIONS FOR THESE CRAFT BRANDS THAT ARE LOOKING FOR WHOLESALE. PARTNERS TO HELP THEM DISTRIBUTE THE REST OF THE COUNTRY SO THERE AREN'T THERE'S A LOT OF. INNOVATION GOING ON IN THE MARKET PLACE RIGHT NOW THIS ISN'T YOUR BINARY CHOICE BETWEEN. THE TWO THING YOU KNOW ACCESS TO THE MARKET PLACE THERE'S- A LOT THAT GOES ON- THERE AS WELL. I W. S. TO BE WAY HAS PARTNERED WITH MANY CRAFT BRANDS AROUND THE COUNTRY WE- REALLY PUT A LOT OF RESOURCES AND TIME INTO LESSENING BECOMING BETTER PARTNERS FOR ALL OF OUR CRAFT BRICK BRANDS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY- YOU KNOW TO SAY OKAY YOU KNOW. ATC HAS PERCEIVED INSIST ON THE SOLUTION WE KNOW THAT THE LONG TERM IMPACT OF THIS IS. THAT WE SEE IN OTHER STATES FROM. FRONT LINE WHICH IS NOT ALL SUNSHINE AND RAINBOWS. BUT WE HAVE SEEN THAT THERE ARE YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME SERIOUS ISSUES. YOU KNOW HOW DEPENDENT. WE HELP THESE BRANDS. I DO WE LESSEN BETTER HOW DO I CLOSE THE UNDERTAKE AND- AT. IT WILL BE ROLLING WE HAVE LOT W. W. A. ACCESS- WHICH DOES CONNECT SOME OF THOSE BRANDS. THESE WITH WHOLESALERS- AND AGAIN IT'S OUR WAY OF BEING A BETTER LISTENER WE KNOW. THAT A THREE TIER SYSTEM HAS BENEFITS THAT ARE WORTH. PROTECTING THAT RE WORTH FIGHTING FOR BETTER OR WORSE KEEPING IN THIS INDUSTRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE. THE US MARKET PLACE IT IS. IS THE MODEL THAT IT ISN'T A WORLD. SO WE KNOW IT'S INCUMBENT ON OUR- THAT. TO OFFER MORE SOLUTIONS- AGAIN BACK IN ABOUT A WEEK OUR NEW OUR ROLE OUR NEW AXIS PLAYBOOK WILL ROLL OUT AND AGAIN THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING THAT. OUR OUR ANSWER TO A LOT OF THESE QUESTIONS. ARE BY THE NUMBERS. ALL OF THIS WHICH YOU KNOW AGAIN NOT SCARE TACTICS- BUT JUST- NOW EIGHTEEN STATES THIS YEAR THAT CONSIDER DTCS. SHIPPING MEASURES- THERE ARE FIVE STATES IN DC RIGHT NOW THAT ALLOWS SHIPPING AND THE NUMBER IS SO LOW BECAUSE A LOT OF THESE STATES HAVE TAKEN A LOOK AT WHAT THE ONLINE MARKETPLACE REALLY YES. THERE ARE SOME ISSUES NOW THERE'S A LOT OF. YOU KNOW HOW WE DISCUSS THESE THINGS WITH MY MYSTERY WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE YOU KNOW ENCOURAGE ALL OF THEIR MEMBERS TO BE COMPLIANT AND THEY DO A GREAT JOB AT THAT HOWEVER THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT ACTORS IN THE EAST IN THE SHIPPING MARKET PLACE. AND THERE'S  LOT OF QUESTIONS A LOT OF EXTRA WORK A LOT O PROBLEMS ON A TRACKING DOWN CRIMINAL ELEMENTS. THAT THE IS STATE REGULATORS NEED TO DO ONCE DTC IS OPENED UP SO YOU SEE THAT. EVERY STATE RIGHT NOW THAT CONSIDERS. MEASURES THIS YEAR DID NOT MOVE FORWARD- AGAIN IF IT DOES ALSO HAVE LAID OUT ON THE NATIONAL AGENT A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT NATIONAL POLICY GROUPS WHERE AGAIN- THAT DATA WAS CONSIDERED AND PRESENTED AND WHAT WAS UNDERSTOOD IS THAT ENFORCEMENT MEASURES ADDITIONAL ENFORCEMENT MEASURES. FOR STATE REGULATORS SHOULD BE PURSUED TO GET A BETTER IDEA OF WHAT GOES ON IN THE WIND SHIPPING MARKETPLACE AS OUT OF STATE COMPANIES ALL SUPPLIERS AND RETAILERS SHIPPING AND THIS COLUMN. YES COULD I ASK YOU TO CALL WE'VE GOT- FOUR SPEAKERS IN THIS THING AND SO CAN I WE WANT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET A COPY OF THIS DEBT BECAUSE I FOUND A LOT OF- SO VERY INTERESTING AND NEW INFORMATION TO ME SO. I WOULD LIKE TO GET A DEATH BUT IF YOU COULD KIND OF. GET THROUGH THIS I WOULD CERTAINLY APPRECIATE JUST SO- WE CAN LET THE OTHER SPEAKERS SPEAK. ABSOLUTELY AND I DO WANT TO GET MY COLLEAGUES TIME SO I WILL SAY YOU THERE WAS MENTION OF. THIS TO SHARE SOME OF THIS DATA IT'S NOT SCARE TACTICS THAT IN ACTUAL REPORTS FROM REGULATORS THROUGH THEIR LEGISLATURES FROM KANSAS FROM VIRGINIA OR MANY OTHER STATES.

I'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AFTER THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU MISS KELLY- NOW WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO OUR NEXT WITNESS IS DAVID KRIEGER WITH THE CALIFORNIA BEER AND BEVERAGE DISTRIBUTORS. MR KRIEGER WELCOME. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MR MEMBERS STEPHEN HERE TODAY. CALIFORNIA BEER AND BEVERAGE DISTRICT. ARE TRADERS THAT'S- RIGHT. AND OF BEER BEVERAGES. HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF DIRECT TO CONSUMER SIPPING A BEER AND MALT BEVERAGES FROM OUT OF STATE. ACTORS I DO NOT HAVE A CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS LICENSED PREMISES WITHIN THE STATE. THE B. B. B. ACCORDING. THREE TIER SYSTEM OF REGULATED ALCOHOL DISTRIBUTION CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS THE REGULATORY DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS OF LICENSING AND DELIVERY OF. THE CURRENT SYSTEM HAS WORKED WELL TO MAINTAIN A SAFE AND ORDERLY MARKETPLACE C. B. D. RESPECTFULLY OPPOSES EXPANSION OF DIRECT TO CONSUMER SIPPING A BEER FROM PRODUCERS IMPORTERS WHOLESALERS AND RETAILERS FROM ACROSS STATE LINES. EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW PERMITS BEER MANUFACTURERS WITHIN STATE GROUP BREWERY LICENSE ID EIGHTY EIGHT SHIFTER PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO CALIFORNIA RETAILERS AND CONSUMERS. EXPANDING DIRECTION FROM OUT OF STATE ACTIONS UNDER NOT UNDERMINE THE STATE'S RECORDING REGULATORY INTERESTS. IN MAINTAINING A SAFE MARKET PLACE AND COULD LEAD TO SOME UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. CORRECTION A BEER AND MALT BEVERAGES ACROSS STATE LINES AND DIRECTLY INTO THE HANDS OF CONSUMERS INCREASED UNDERAGE ACCESS TO REGISTERED TO A LACK OF STATE REGULATORY OVERSIGHT. BACKSTAGE SHIPPERS EVEN WELL INTENTIONED ONES OFTEN HAVE MINIMAL TIES TO OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND HAVE LESS ABILITY AN ECCENTRIC HELP KEEP OUR CALL AND ANSWER CHANTS. THE KNITTING SYSTEM WORKS WELL TO ENSURE THAT A LOCALLY PRESENT RESPONSIBLE AND STATE LICENSE ACTUALLY COMPLIES WITH CALIFORNIA LAW INCLUDING AGE VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS WHILE MAINTAINING A LONG TERM INTEGRITY IN OVERSIGHT. OF STATE LICENSED. AND REGULATED BEER DISTRIBUTION HELP. INTERSTATE DIRECT OF BEER INTO QUESTIONS WHY. AND QUALITY CONTROL SUPPLY CHAIN. IT RAISES ISSUES OF CONCERN SUCH AS THE POTENTIAL SHIPMENT OF EXPIRED- OR ADULTERATED PRODUCTS. ASHLEY CONCERNING THE- ARTICLE HAS A LIMITED SHELF LIFE AND OFTEN REQUIRES REFRIGERATION TO MAINTAIN PRODUCT QUALITY. QUALITY DEGRADATION IS DAMAGING TO THE OVERALL BEER CATEGORY. THAT'S RIGHT THE QUESTION WHO WILL BE RESPONSIBLE. REGULATORS WOULD HAVE LIMITED AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE AND ENFORCE PENALTIES ON OUT OF STATE CHAIRPERSON ALCOHOL PRODUCTS ARE RECEIVED BY MINOR OR WHEN ADULTERY OR EXPIRED BEVERAGES ARE SHIPPED INTO THE STATE. IT'S AN ONGOING INDUSTRY ISSUE IN THE INDUSTRY IN FACT RECENTLY- TELLING YOUR DRESS CONCERNS OVER EXPIRED BEVERAGES BOSTON BEER. THE PRODUCER OF TRULY MORE BASED ON SEARCH AND DESTROY- IT'S OVER PRODUCTION OF RESULTS ARE BECAUSE IT WAS NEAR EXPIRATION. IT WAS THE ENGINE NO LONGER MEET STANDARD OF COMMERCIAL QUALITY. CORRECT THE CONSUMER SHIPMENTS MAY ALSO RESULT IN BEER AND OTHER MALTED BEVERAGES BEING SENT INTO THE STATE WITHOUT PAYING FOR THE REQUIRED HELPING EXTEND AXONS. STATE LOCAL TAXES OR THE APPROPRIATE STATE REGULATORY OVERSIGHT. PRACTICING ALREADY CHALLENGING TASK. ALLOWING OUT OF STATE YOUR MANUFACTURERS TO DIRECTLY SHOULD BE HELPING CONSUMERS MAKE TAX RETURNS A COLLECTION EVEN MORE DIFFICULTY TENUOUS. AND CONCORD CALIFORNIA BREWERS AT A DISADVANTAGE. IT'S CLEAR THAT THE PROBLEMS ARE MOST AFFECTED DEALT WITH TWENTY EXISTING CREATURES SYSTEM I'LL CALL DISTRIBUTIONS MAINTAIN. BASED ON THESE ISSUES WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE POTENTIAL EXPANSION OF DIRECT TO CONSUMER SIPPING A BEER AND OTHER MALTED BEVERAGES FROM OUT OF STATE. ACTORS ON THE CALL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR KRIEGER NOW WILL MOVE TO A MISTER MARLAND MANSUR- PRESIDENT THE NEIGHBORHOOD MARKET ASSOCIATION OF SAN DIEGO- THANK YOU MR MONTOUR- PLEASE BE BEGIN. THANK YOU AS WELL GOOD AFTERNOON SHARED COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING. IN ALLOWING US ALL THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOICE OUR CONCERNS WITH S. E. SIX TWENTY. MY NAME IS MARLIN SORT AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD MARKET ASSOCIATION ORGANIZATION CONSISTING OF OVER SIX HUNDRED FIFTY INDEPENDENT RETAILERS. IN FAMILY OWNED BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA THE VAST MAJORITY OF WHICH SELL THE BEVERAGES BEING DISCUSSED IN INVOLVED WITH S. P. SIX ONE. WE HAVE MANY CONCERNS WITH THE POTENTIAL ENACTMENT OF THIS BILL FAMILY OWNED BUSINESSES. THE IMPACT ON FAMILIES IN THE COMMUNITY. CALIFORNIA JOBS IN THE TREMENDOUS ISSUES OF CREATING A REGULATORY SCHEME. TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE NOW FIRST IN REGARDS TO THE IMPACTS THIS LAW WOULD HAVE A FAMILY OWNED BUSINESS CALIFORNIA FAMILY BEST DISTILLER. WOULD BE ONE TAKEN AWAY FROM A CALIFORNIA REACH. THESE ARE RETAILERS WHOSE SALES ARE VITAL TAX REVENUE FOR OUR GOVERNMENT. IN TURN THIS EFFECTS OF THIS NEGATIVE IMPACTS WOULD HAVE ON SMALL FAMILY OWNED BUSINESSES AND LOCAL BUSINESS OWNERS WHAT FLOW DOWN AND REALLY AFFECTS CALIFORNIANS FROM GETTING QUALITY JOCKS AT THESE MARKETS. SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND RETAILERS. HAVE BECOME A PART OF THE FABRIC OF THE COMMUNITY. THEY'RE NOT ONLY JOB CREATORS ENGINE DRIVERS FOR OUR ECONOMY. ESPECIALLY AS WE SEEN IN THE LAST TWENTY PLUS MONTHS ESPECIALLY IN TIMES WHERE IT'S MOST NEEDED. OUR MEMBERS ARE ACTIVELY IN LOCAL CHARITY ORGANIZATIONS RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS COMMUNITY AND SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS THEY'RE PART OF THE FABRIC OF OUR GREAT STATE. WHAT THIS LAW DOES IS HURT SMALL BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS. WHO ALSO REPRESENT THE EASIEST AND MOST SIMPLE TRACK ON INSURING COMPLIANCE UNDER REACH ACCESS TO ALCOHOL SOMETHING THEY DO ON A DAILY BASIS. IN REGARDS TO THIS COMMITMENT TO COMPLIANCE IN THESE ISSUES WITHOUT OF STATE COMPLIANCE. OUR ORGANIZATION THE NEIGHBOR MARCUS DECISION. LIKE MANY SMALL BUSINESSES AND RETAILERS HAVE A GREAT CONNECTION AND OUTREACH WITH OUR OUR STATE ABC. WE TEAM UP WITH THE RECEIPTS ORGANIZED MASSIVELY TRAININGS WITH OUR MEMBERS TO ENSURE THEY ARE UP TO DATE WITH NEW LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH. ALL THE LOSS JUST IN THE PAST COUPLE WEEKS WE'VE HOSTED THE ABC SUPERVISING AGENT IN CHARGE LOCALLY DOWN HERE IN SAN DIEGO. WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE JUST A ONE HOUR MEETING ENDED UP SURPASSING AN HOUR AND A HALF. OUR BOARD MEMBERS AND MEMBERS. WERE ASKING QUESTIONS WANTING TO KNOW WHAT WAS NEW. WHAT IS THE ABC CONCERNED WITH WHAT ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO AS RETAILERS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE. AND ENSURE THAT EVERYONE IS BENEFITING FROM WHAT HAPPENS. WE'RE IN CONSTANT CONTACT WITH ABC LEADERSHIP YOU SEE GENERAL COUNSEL SPOKE EARLIER TODAY. ENSURING THAT WE HAVE A RELATIONSHIP TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ALWAYS IN CONSTANT COMMUNICATION CONTACTS. THAT BENEFITS OUR MEMBERS IN BENEFITS B. B. C. AS WELL. LET'S GET A BIT OF BACKGROUND ON ME JUST THREE MONTHS AGO I WAS WORKING AS A PROSECUTOR HANDLING DRUG DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE CASES MINORS IN POSSESSION. SALES TO MINORS. CASES IN THIS ROCK. WHY WOULD YOUR ORGANIZATION WHOSE. BIG FOCUS HAS THE SALE OF ALCOHOL LIQUOR BEER AND WINE WHY WOULD THEY HAVE SOMEONE LET ME RUN THIS ORGANIZATION. THE ANSWER IS SIMPLE. SCIENCE IS PARAMOUNT TO SMALL BUSINESSES IT IS THEY'RE LIKELY. IT AFFECTS THEIR STANDING IN THE COMMUNITY. IF A LOCAL RETAILER IS FOUND TO HAVE SOLD TO A MINOR AND THAT WE'RE GETS AROUND TOWN. THAT HURTS AND DAMAGES THEIR REPUTATION MAKING IT. IT IS VITAL THE FINES AND SUSPENSIONS FOR VIOLATING. IT IN A. B. C. REGULATION OR ANY OF OUR LOSS. GREATLY IMPACTS OUR RETAILERS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. NOW I SEE DISTRIBUTORS AND CONGLOMERATES ARE NOT GOING TO DO THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE. A CONNECTION WITH THEIR STATE ABC THEY'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A COMMITMENT TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE ON A DAILY BASIS. HOW TO USE FOR THEM TO BE A DROP IN THE BUCKET AND ONE NOT SUCCESSFULLY DID SURE. DID TURN THESE LARGE CORPORATIONS FROM ENSURING COMPLIANCE. READ AN AVALANCHE OF ISSUES WITH UNDERAGE ACCESS TO ALCOHOL. IT pWOULD CAUSE THIS COMMITTEE AND OTHER COMMITTEES. TALK TO FOCUS ON CREATING A REGULATORY SCHEME FROM THESE OUT OF STATE DISTILLERS. IN SOME OUR FOCUS IS TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA FAMILY OWNED BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIANS SIX FEET ABOVE ALL ELSE I URGE THIS COMMITTEE TO THINK OF THE TREMENDOUS. NEGATIVE IMPACTS THIS BILL WOULD HAVE ON A FAMILY OWNED BUSINESS. ON LOCAL TAXPAYERS ARE EMPLOYEES THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE HERE WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR- MONSOOR- NOW WE HAVE- MR BACK- PLEASE- MR BACK IS- THE BUSINESS REPRESENTATIVE FOR TEAMSTERS LOCAL EIGHT FIFTY THREE WELCOME THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING TO OUR HEARING TODAY VIRTUALLY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. MY NAME IS STEVE BACK AND I'M A BUSINESS REPRESENTATIVE FOR TEAMSTERS LOCAL EIGHT FIFTY THREE LOCATED IN OAKLAND. I'M HERE TODAY TO GIVE SOME INSIGHT ON WHY SB SIX TWENTY BY SENATOR ALAN IS NOT IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE WORKING CLASS PEOPLE. NOT ONLY IN MY BUSINESS REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE WINE AND SPIRITS INDUSTRY I'VE ALSO SPENT TWENTY THREE YEARS OF MY LIFE WORKING AS A SALES PERSON IN SAN FRANCISCO. WHAT IS BEING DISCUSSED TODAY NOT ONLY WILL ALLOW LICENSED DISTILLERS TO GET A FOOT IN THE DOOR TURNED OUT THE FABRIC OF THE THREE TIER SYSTEM. IT WILL DESTROY SEVERAL THOUSANDS OF WELL PAYING UNION JOBS AT ALL LEVELS FROM CUSTOMER SERVICE SALESPEOPLE MERCHANDISERS TELEMARKETING SALES DRIVERS AND WAREHOUSE PERSONS. THOUSANDS OF HARD WORKING MEN AND WOMEN WILL LOSE GREAT MEDICAL BENEFITS HI PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS. RETIREMENT MEDICAL COVERAGE FOR THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES. AND MANY OTHER NEGOTIATED BENEFITS. OVER MANY YEARS WE HAVE BUILT A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE LARGEST DISTRIBUTORS IN CALIFORNIA. I KNOW SAME DISTRIBUTORS HIRE HUNDREDS OF UNION EMPLOYEES. IN ADDITION WE HAVE ALSO PARTNER WITH THESE SAME EMPLOYERS TO CREATE A SAFER SALLY MARKET FREE FROM VIOLATIONS OF A. B. C. AND D. T. B. RULES LAWS AND REGULATIONS. WE WORK TOGETHER ON COMPLIANCE TRAINING FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES ARE MEMBERS TO HELP EVERYONE UNDERSTAND WHAT A LEGAL OR ILLEGAL PRACTICE WOULD BE IN THE INDUSTRY AND HOW TO STAY CLEAR OF VIOLATIONS. DO WE REALLY BELIEVE THIS BILL IS TAKING ALL OF WHAT I'VE JUST STATED INTO CONSIDERATION. I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER IF THIS WILL BE THE FOOT IN THE DOOR THAT WILL ALLOW THE LARGER DISTILLERS AND OTHERS TO DISMANTLE THE THREE TIER SYSTEM. AND THEN WHAT WILL BE WILL WE BE COMPETING WITH AMAZON IF THEY DECIDE TO START MANUFACTURING SPIRITS. WE BE REPLACING GOOD UNION JOBS HERE IN CALIFORNIA WITH LOW WAGE OPPORTUNITIES FROM OUT OF STATE. WELL AS A SALES PERSON AND A REPRESENTATIVE OF SALES PEOPLE I APPRECIATE THE NEED TO BRING A WIDE ARRAY OF PRODUCTS TO THE MARKET. BUT WE BELIEVE THIS CAN BE DONE SAFELY AND EFFICIENTLY THROUGH THE THREE TIER SYSTEM. A MODEL THAT HAS BALANCED PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS WITH EDUCATION TAXATION AND THE CREATION OF JOBS AND LISTENING TO SOME OF THE STATEMENTS MADE HERE TODAY. FINDS ME OF WHEN I WAS A SALES PERSON A SAN FRANCISCO AND I WAS WORKING WITH A SMALL CRAPS DEALER ON TRYING TO INTRODUCE PRODUCTS INTO SOME OF THE ACCOUNTS AT SAN FRANCISCO. AND IT REMINDS ME OF COMPLIANCE WHERE THIS. SUPPLIER WAS OFFERING FREE GOODS FOR EVERY BOTTLE THAT WAS PURCHASED TO THESE. TO THESE BUYERS AND HALFWAY THROUGH THE DAY I HAVE TO PULL TO THE SIDE AND EXPLAIN TO HIM THAT THAT'S A VIOLATION OF ABC LAW. YOU CANNOT DO THAT AND HE HAD NO IDEA WHAT HE WAS FROM OUT OF OUT OF STATE AND TWO I REALLY DON'T BELIEVE IT REALLY AFFECTED HIS DECISION ONE WAY OR ANOTHER BECAUSE HE WENT ON FOR THE REST OF THE DAY TO CONTINUE TO OFFER THE FREE GOODS. AND THAT IS JUST A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THAT I'VE HAD- WRITING WITH- ONE OF THE SMALL CRAFT DISTILLERS. WITH THAT I'LL GLADLY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE PANELISTS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SEVERAL. I'M I'M JUST PLAIN FOLKS I'M I'M LETTING IT RUN IN THE EFFORT TO GET ON A PLANE SECOND YOUR DINNER MY FAMILY BUT I DO APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY OF S. RELLY HELPS A LOT OF THOUGHTS ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS HAVE BEEN SAID BUT I WILL BE LISTENING TO THE DISCUSSION AND THE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE ON THE FEET AS I. HEAD TO THE AIRPORT TO THANK% EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SENATOR. YOU KNOW I'M JUST GOING TO KIND OF GO THROUGH AND- AND- JUST SELECTIVELY ASK SOME QUESTIONS HERE- SO MISS MISS KELLY- IT IS THERE SOME KIND OF LIMITATION ON HOW MANY MANUFACTURERS CAN SHIP ORGANIZATION WOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH. I MEAN IF IT'S NOT EVERYBODY IS THERE. IS THERE SOME NUMBER JUST TRYING TO- YOU KNOW GET A REFERENCE ON THAT- YOU KNOW I THINK THAT ONCE YOU OPEN UP THE SYSTEM IT IT'S OPEN RIGHT IT'S EITHER. DID YOU KNOW THAT THEY HAVE REGULATORY PROTECTIONS ARE EITHER THERE OR IF THEY'RE NOT THERE SO- NO I DON'T THINK THERE'S A NUMBER AT THIS TIME THAT WE WOULD. BE DISCUSSING- DEFINITELY A DIFFERENT. SIDE A DIFFERENT. WAY BUT NOT YOU INTERSTATE SHIPPING RIGHT WHICH IS THE IMPORTANT SIDE IF THAT'S COMING IN FROM OUT OF STATE. SHE DID ANSWER AND THEN I'M A FOLLOW UP WITH THAT. ANOTHER QUESTION IS WHAT WHAT HAS BEEN THE IMPACT OF WIND THE WIND INDUSTRY HAVING THE ABILITY. TO SHIP DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS. HAS THAT HURT DISTRIBUTORS. I YOU KNOW HONESTLY IT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT DISTRIBUTORS IT IS ABOUT THIS INDUSTRY IS SO CLOSELY TIED TOGETHER- IT IMPACTS EVERYONE FROM YOU KNOW ALL THREE TIERS OF THE BUSINESS TRUE. THE CONSUMER HONESTLY- AND ESPECIALLY THE STATE IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS SO YOU KNOW. AGAIN I THINK THE OTHER PANEL WAS TALKING A LOT ABOUT SCARE TACTICS AND AGAIN I DON'T I DON'T THINK THAT THEY ARE SCARE TACTICS THEY ARE ACTUALLY DATA. PROVIDED BY- THE REGULATORY AGENCIES TO STATE AN OFFICIAL REPORTS THE LEGISLATURES THAT SHOW. IN THE INSTANCE OF RIGID NIGH AND WENT OVER 38% OF THE SHIPMENTS COMING IN THAT COULD BE IDENTIFIED. ARE ACTUALLY LEGAL IT DOESN'T MEAN- BECAUSE- THERE WAS NO WAY FOR THOSE BUSINESSES TO GET LICENSES THAT THEY CHOSE NOT TO GET A LICENSE AND CHOSE NOT TO BE TAXES. EXCISE TAX INVOLVED GREAT RETAIL TAX. AS YOU KNOW ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES JUST POINTED OUT THEY WOULD NEVER MIND I GOT YOU YOU IDIOTS ARE PRETTY MUCH THE QUESTION I GUESS GOT TO GET ENOUGH QUESTIONS OUT TO EVERYBODY AND THEN WE HAVE. PUBLIC COMMENTS SO SORRY TO CUT YOU SHORT THERE I DID GET YOUR POINT I AM LOOKING FOR TO GET YOUR DESK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME- MR KRIEGER IN YOUR OPINION HOW DIFFICULT IS IT. FOR A BREWERY ENTER INTO A DISTRIBUTION. CONTRACT WITH THE DISTRIBUTOR. WHERE ARE SURE I- QUALIFIED TO TALK THE- DETAILS ON ON HOW DOES THE START BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY IT'S BACK. WHEN THINGS ARE REALLY PROUD OF- IS THAT WE HAVE BEEN THE PATHWAY- TO. THE DIVERSITY THAT YOU FIND ON SHELVES OR YOU WALK INTO A GROCERY STORE. AND YOU SEE THE LARGE ARRAY OF CRAFT BEERS IN FRONT OF YOU THAT ARE AVAILABLE. A BIG REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE THREE TIER SYSTEM AND THE INVOLVEMENT OF OUR DISTRIBUTORS ABOUT PROCESS OKAY. WELL I'VE NOT BEEN PERSONALLY INVOLVED IN. IN YOU KNOW THAT THE CREATION OF THOSE ROADS BUSINESS OUR ARRANGEMENTS- I CAN TELL YOU THAT HISTORICALLY WE REALLY HAVE LED TO THAT. ACCESS AND AVAILABILITY- WHICH I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY IS ULTIMATELY ONE OF THE GOALS RIGHT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT CONSUMERS HAVE CHOICE. YEAH I'M GONNA ASK YOU THE SAME QUESTION I ASKED- MS KALLIO IN THEN- MR BACK YOU CAN BE PREPARED SOMEONE ASK YOU THE NEXT QUESTION BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ONE IS HAVE REPEALED- HAS THE ABILITY OF WINE TO SHIP DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS IMPACTED THE NUMBER OF JOBS AVAILABLE. R. I CAN'T SAY THAT ON BEHALF OF BEER I HAVE AN ANSWER A QUESTION I APOLOGIZE I CAN FOLLOW UP. YEAH I THINK I THINK IF YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE TODAY IS WE HAVE A CONCRETE EXAMPLE I JUST WANT TO MAKE CLEAR. WE GOT A CONCRETE EXAMPLE OF WHAT IS WORKING WITH DIRECT TO CONSUMER IN OUR COUNTRY IN OUR STATE. IT'S SO AS WE- TRANSFER THE OLD MOVE DOWN THE LINE AND START TALKING TO PEOPLE AND WE'VE HEARD A LOT TODAY. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU LOOK AT THESE THINGS AND ARE ABLE TO COMMENT DIRECTLY ON THAT MR BACK DO YOU HAVE A- IN THE ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT. MISTER CHAIRMAN I DO NOT- BUT I CAN SAY IT IN THE TIME OF BEING A SALES PERSON. WHEN I WAS A SALES PERSON- WE WORK HAND IN HAND WITH ALL OF THE DISTILLERS AND SUPPLIERS- TO GET PRODUCT THAT THEY NEEDED TO THE MARKET- I EAT INNOVATIVE BRANDS ANY BRAND NEW GRAPE VODKA BUT WHATEVER THEY'D CREATED IT WAS OUR JOB TO GET IT OUT INTO THE MARKET AND WE WERE VERY SUCCESSFUL AT IT I HAD A VERY GOOD LIVING. SELLING BRANDS THAT THEY PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SELL AT THEIR OWN FACILITIES OUT IN THE MARKET PLACE- IF THAT HELPS IT I KNOW DOESN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION- BUT I JUST DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT HOUSE SO I THINK FOR THIS PANEL THAT SOMETHING THAT- WHAT WE NEED TO HAVE SOME FURTHER DIALOGUE ON- AS WE GO FORWARD CERTAINLY SENATOR ALLEN'S GONNA BE INTERESTED IN HEARING OUR THOUGHTS AS- THE REST OF THE COMMITTEE WILL BECAUSE THAT. IS YOU KNOW FOR KIND OF A SHINING EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'VE HEARD TODAY AND SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO GET YOUR VOICE ON THIS ISSUE. ON THE ON ON ON THE SPECIFIC ISSUES OF HEY IF IT'S WORK FOR THIS HOW DO YOU SEE IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFERENT WITH SPIRITS HOW DO YOU SEE IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFERENT WITH BEER SO THANK YOU ALL OF YOU ALL FOUR OF YOU.

TO SELL TO CONSUMERS. WHEN I STARTED THERE WAS NOT EVEN A INKLING OF A DREAM THAT WE'D BE ABLE TO SELL DIRECT TO CONSUMER- WE DIDN'T HAVE A CRAPPY. LIFE THAN I AM HI OR BUY OFF THE WHOLE THE WINEGROWERS LIGHT THE MY FARM OVER. SIXTY ACRES OF WINE GRAPES MY- PRODUCT IS SOLD THE BRANDY WINE MAKER FOR THE DISTILLER SECOND. I HAVE THE RIGHT TO SELL DIRECT TO CONSUMER AND ACTUALLY THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER LICENSEE TYPE THE CALIFORNIA BRANDY MANUFACTURERS WHO CAN SELL THEIR PRODUCTS AND HAVE BEEN SELLING THEIR PRODUCT. DIRECT TO CONSUMER WITHIN THE STATE.

THANK YOU THE CHAIRMAN THANK THE COMMITTEE PLAYING SPEAK MY NAME IS CARSON BENOWITZ FREDERICKS AND RESEARCH DIRECTOR ALCOHOL JUSTICE BEEN REBEL. I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS OPPOSITION TO EXPANSION DIRECT DELIVERY- WE UNDERSTAND THAT- DIRECT DELIVERY IS GOING TO MAKE IT MUCH MORE LIKELY THAT ALL SALES WILL OCCUR WITHOUT- ANY ABILITY TO MONITOR OR- ENGAGE RESPONSIBLE BEVERAGE SERVICE PRACTICES- IT'S- USUALLY THAT. INCLUDES THAT- FAILURES TO CARD RECIPIENTS- AND ALSO- DURING CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE IT'S BEING SOLD SOMEBODY WAS DANGEROUSLY INTOXICATED OR OTHERWISE ENGAGE IT RECEIVED. THAT PRODUCTS ARE- MOREOVER IT- DRAFT CANCER CAL THE ONLY TO SEND ENFORCE REGULATIONS WHEN YOU END UP HAVING- THAT NATIONWIDE DIRECT DELIVERY ARE THERE IF THEY ALREADY AN EXAMPLE OF THIS WHICH IS THAT IF YOU GO TO- MAN AT AN ONLINE MARKETPLACE FOR ALCOHOL. ROB SIXTY FIVE WARNING BECAUSE THAT THE CANCER WARNING THAT WE ARE ALL VERY FAMILIAR SEEING IN EVERY CORNER STORE. HI IT'S TURNED INTO A- OPT IN LINK CLICK HERE IF YOU'D LIKE TO VIEW THIS MORNING AND THAT IS. EVENTUALLY- AND IN A WAY TO IGNORE CALIFORNIA'S SOVEREIGNTY AND IN TERMS OF SETTING. THAT PARTICULAR WARNING STANDARD. ARE THE- AREA STILL YOU CAN EITHER SIDE THE SPIRALING INTO AN INABILITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO- THAT ANY. STANDARD- MORE THAN THAT ALSO WE HEAR THAT THIS BILL IF IT WORKS AS ADVERTISED WILL RESULT IN- OVERALL INCREASE IN SALES OF ALCOHOL TO CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS- THAT THERE IS KIND OF NO WAY FOR THIS TO NOT HARM ANY ANY. OTHER BUSINESS FACTOR IN THIS FACTOR WITHOUT NEEDING THAT CALIFORNIANS ARE DRINKING MORE. AND WE'RE GONNA BE WE AS WE ARE EVERY TIME WE'RE GOING TO BE THE VOICE OF REASON HERE WHICH IS THAT ALCOHOL HARM IS BEEN ON A STEADY CLIMB IN THE STATE FOR TWENTY YEARS. ALL WE HAVE SEEN A- 50% INCREASE IN DIAGNOSES IN ALCOHOL USE DISORDER IN IN THIS COUNTRY IN TWO THOUSAND TO TWO THOUSAND WE HAVE SEEN A DRASTIC INCREASE IN DEATHS FROM LIVER DISEASE WE HAVE SEEN- IT AND- A REMARKABLE AMOUNT OF THAT HAS BEEN CONCRETE IN YOUNG. CONSUMERS THAT MEANS THAT THIS IS NOT JUST.

MAXIMO CAROLINE FORTY THREE AGAIN NINE FORTY THREE PLEASE GO AHEAD. MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS- THIS IS JOE LANG REPRESENTING REPUBLIC NATIONAL DISTRIBUTING- PREVIOUSLY KNOWN I THINK HERE IS YOUNG'S MARKET COMPANY FOR OVER A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE YEARS. OKAY MISTER CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE THE TIME TO CHAT- A COUPLE OF IMPORTANT POINTS I THINK ONE I LIKED HIM MAKE IT CLEAR THAT AS WHOLESALERS HERE CALIFORNIA WE ARE SENSITIVE TO THE NEEDS OF SMALL DISTILLERS TO CALIFORNIA. WE WORKED OVER THE YEARS TO HELP THEM HELP THEM GET THEIR PRODUCTS TO MARKET BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THEY ARE OUR FUTURE CUSTOMERS AND THE FUTURE. PRODUCTS THAT WE WILL DISTRIBUTE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SURE WE WORKED WITH THEM IN THE PAST A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT PIECES OF LEGISLATION- HELPING THEM TO GROW. HOWEVER ALLOWING LARGE OUT OF STATE SELLERS TO SHIP DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT MAP. THERE IS REALLY IN FACT NO DEMONSTRATED NEED TO MAKE THIS CHANGE FOR LARGE OUT OF STATE TO STORES- THEY'RE NOT HURTING BUT THEY WEREN'T IMPACTED BY CODED. AS FOR OUR SMALL CALIFORNIA DISTILLERS HERE AND SO WE NEED AND WE THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE A DISTINCTION. BETWEEN OUR SMALL CALIFORNIA BASED DISTILLERS AND THE NEED TO HELP FOSTER AND FACILITATE THEIR GROWTH VERSUS LARGE OUT OF STATE THE SELLER'S SHIPPING DIRECTLY TO CALIFORNIA. TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION MISTER CAIR DIRECTLY ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE WITH WINE THE REPORT DID NOTE THAT WINE ACTUALLY THE PRIVILEGE TO SHIP TO CONSUMERS WAS DEVELOPED OVER DECADES AS PART OF. THE ORIGINAL LEGISLATION RECOGNIZING THE WINE IN FACT IS THE CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS. THE SYSTEM THE RETAIL SYSTEM THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM SYSTEM PERFECT SHE GREW UP WITH THAT PRIVILEGE. THAT'S A VERY DIFFERENT SITUATION THAN THE CASE WITH DISTILLED SPIRITS WERE THE CHANGE THE- CONTEMPLATED HERE. WOULD BE A COMPLETE CHANGE FROM THE SYSTEM THAT EXISTS RIGHT NOW AND THEN BECAUSE OF A WHOLE VARIETY OF DISRUPTIONS PUT JOBS AT RISK. BOTH AT THE WHOLESALE LEVEL AND AT THE RETAIL LEVEL SO I THINK. THE ANSWER YOUR QUESTION VERY DIFFERENT VERY DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF HOW THE INDUSTRY'S DEVELOPED AND EVOLVED AND WHILE WHOLESALERS RETAILERS HAVE GROWN WITH THE WINE INDUSTRY AND IT'S BEEN TO THE BENEFIT OF ALL THE SITUATION WITH DISTILLED SPIRITS THAT IMPACT THE VERY DIFFERENT. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN APPRECIATE THE TIME THANKS MR LYING NEXT CALLER PLEASE. MAXIMUM OF TEN NINE THIRTY TWO PLEASE GO AHEAD LINE THIRTY TWO. GOOD AFTERNOON A CHAIR AND MEMBERS HERE TODAY MY NAME IS MINA JIMENEZ I AM SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ALCOHOL POLICY ALLIANCE AND WE'RE OPPOSED TO THE DIRECT TO CONSUMER SHIFTING LEGISLATION BECAUSE OF WHAT WAS ALREADY UP PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED- MATERNITY LEAVE A COMMENT THAT WAS MADE BY THE SPEAKER I THINK THAT IT IS. DEFINITELY A DIFFERENT BALL GAME WHEN IT COMES TO THE DISTILLERS WITH EXPERIENCE- ANYTHING NOW WITHIN A SIMILAR TIME LINE AND WE'D LOOK CRITICALLY AT THAT- BUT WE HAVE PARTICULAR CONCERNS OVER THE LACK OF OVERSIGHT I'M FOR COMPLIANCE- WERE ALREADY HAVING EXISTING ARCHIVE HAD EXISTING CHALLENGES WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT IN ADDITION. TO THE INCREASING COSTS RELATED TO ALCOHOL HARMS THAT ALREADY EXISTS I PRAY IT PRIOR TO COVERT NINETEEN WIDE- IN CALIFORNIA WE DO LIKE THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH EIGHTY P. DEPARTMENT WHO'S BEEN ONGOING- HAVING ONGOING CHALLENGES WITH ENSURING COMPLIANCE. FOR ON SITE ALSO LICENSEES ALREADY WAVING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY WE HAD-A 70% NONCOMPLIANCE RATE FOR SERVING ALCOHOL TO MINORS THE THIRD PARTY ALCOHOL DELIVERY COMPANIES BUT WE HAVE HAD SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES WITH ENSURING COMPLIANCE LET ALONE AN ADDITIONAL LAYER OF CHALLENGES WITH IT SHIPPING DIRECTLY EVEN INCLUDING NOW NATIONAL LEVEL. SHIFTING- OKAY A REALLY PRETTY POINT TO BECOME- THAT WE WANT BRING THE- TO DO. IT AROUND THAT ANGLE OF WHAT DO WE HAVE TO DO THAT- WE ALSO WANT CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE PUBLIC SPACE WE CONTINUING. CONTINUE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW TO COMPLAIN LOUDLY SHARING IT DISREGARDING THE EXISTING **** ABOUT THE HARM. WE KNOW THAT THE CDC PARTLY COVERED NINETEEN WAS ALREADY- NOTING- THE COST TO THE ARCADE AS THIRTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THAT'S NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLARS PER PERSON. TWO DOLLARS AND FORTY CENTS PER DRINK IN TERMS OF ALCOHOL HARM DISTANT EDP DATA AND WE ARE COMPLETELY DISREGARDING. THAT FACT THAT WE ALREADY KNOW THE EXISTING COST OF HARM BUT THE PRIOR TO COVER NINETEEN. AND THERE'S BEEN MUCH CONVERSATION IN THE COURT ABOUT THE POLITICAL CONTENT OF THE BILL ABOUT HOW A LOT MORE ALCOHOL WILL BE SOLD BUT NOT ENOUGH EMPHASIS IS FOCUSED ON HOW DO YOU SPELL. IMPACT ON REAL PEOPLE YOUR CHILDREN YOUR GRANDCHILDREN EVEN FAMILY MEMBERS IMPACTED BY. YOU AND THOUGHT WELL TELL. CAN YOU PLEASE WRAP UP. YOUR OVER WRAPPING UP. WE THINK SOME. IN RESOLVED IN PEOPLE HAVING A LOT MORE ALCOHOL CONTENT. AND THIS IS INCREASE OUR BONITA RECOGNIZED THE COLD NINETEEN. WALLET IN THE BUSINESS OF THE- IN. PEOPLE AND IS SOMETHING THAT WE TO LOOK CRITICALLY AT WORK FIRST OF PEOPLE FORTY INCREASED DRINKING DURING THE ACADEMIC THANK YOU KNOW YOU REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT THE MARKET. VERY MUCH NEXT SPEAKER. NEXT CALLER PLEASE THANK YOU FOR YOUR- THANK YOU. THAT NICER MOTEL LINE TWENTY THREE PLEASE GO AHEAD LINE TWENTY THREE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF COMMUNITY THIS IS PEAK DOWNS. RESIDENTS FAMILY WINEMAKERS CALIFORNIA. WELL I'LL KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF BECAUSE I KNOW WE'RE CONSTRAINED BY TIME. MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT VANGUARD RECORDS WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN GETTING THE GRAND HOME PAGE TO THE SUPREME COURT. HAVING EXCEPTIONAL HOW COME THERE. I CAN I CAN CHOOSE- MADE A POINT EARLIER THAT I CAN REINFORCE CERTAINLY AND THAT IS BECAUSE MANY OF MY MEMBERS ARE SO SMALL. HELLO THERE WOULD BE SOME OF THOSE MEMBERS THAT WOULD NO LONGER BE WITH US WITHOUT DIRECT TO CONSUMER SHIPMENTS IT REALLY WAS A LIFESAVER FOR MANY MANY SMALL WINERIES AS I'M SURE IT WILL BE FOR THE AIRCRAFT BURST IN PARTITION TO STROLLERS. THE OTHER POINT I WANT TO MAKE- SENATOR DODD IS THAT. B. DISTRICT CURRENT DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM TRICKED YOUR SYSTEM REALLY DOESN'T WORK FOR SMALL WINERIES. AND I SUSPECT IT ISN'T WORKING WELL FOR THE PREPARATION THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT. WHOLESALER CONSOLIDATION HAS HAPPENED OVER THE LAST DECADE AND THE SMALL WINERIES THAT AT ONE POINT. MIGHT HAVE A CHANCE TO GETTING DISTRIBUTION THROUGH THE STRINGERS THAT IS SUBSTANTIALLY IN THAT AREA. SO I WOULD SAY THAT- EMILY WINEMAKERS WOULD LIKE TO SUPPORT JUST. CURRENT LEGISLATION. ON BEHALF OF ALL THOSE SMALL LOCAL BUSINESSES NOT JUST THE ONE CHARACTERS BUT THE BREWERS AND DISTILLERS THANK YOU SURE THANK YOU MR DOWNS NEXT WEEK PLEASE. IN MAXIMO TO LINE FORTY TWO AGAIN NINE FORTY TWO PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU THIS IS PATRICIA SWANSON CHAIRMAN OF SHELTER DISTILLING IN MAMMOTH LAKES CALIFORNIA SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF CONTINUED BPC SHIPPING. SHELTER DISTILLING OPENED ITS DOORS IN DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN OUR ANNUAL SALES WILL REACH TWO AND A HALF MILLION THIS YEAR AND WE EMPLOY THIRTY PEOPLE. AT THE TRUE FOR SO MANY HOSPITALITY BUSINESSES THE TWENTY TWENTY COLBERT SHOT DOWN THE DEVASTATING. THANKS TO THE ABC AND GOVERNOR THE EMERGENCY ORDER ENABLING US TO SHIP PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO OUR CALIFORNIA CUSTOMERS HELP ENSURE OUR SURVIVAL NEARLY TWO YEARS pTO FLOURISH AUGMENTING THE IN STORE SALES. SINCE OUR DISTILLERY IS LOCATED IN A TOURIST DESTINATION THE ABILITY TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS ONLINE KEEPS OUR CUSTOMERS ENGAGED LONG AFTER THEY RETURNED HOME WE CAN BRING IN REVENUE AND BUILD OUR BRAND TO THIS IMPORTANT SALES CHANNEL SH IT ALSO ALLOWS US TO PROVIDE AN ESSENTIAL SHIPPING SERVICE FOR CUSTOMERS IN STORE WHO WANT TO PURCHASE OUR SPIRITS. BUT ARE NOT ABLE TO EASILY TRAVEL HOME WITH THEM. AS AN ASIDE MIS COLEGAS ASSERTION EARLIER THAT LOCAL LICENSED RETAIL DELIVERY ISN'T ADEQUATE ALTERNATIVE P. E. T. C. WELL THAT DOESN'T WORK FOR DISTILLERIES LIKE OURS LOCATED IN TOURIST DESTINATION. THOSE OPPOSED TO THIS EXPANSION PROVIDE NO VIABLE OPTIONS FOR CRAFT DISTILLERS TO REPLACE ITS IMPORTANT REVENUE STREAM SHOULD PROVIDE THE CUSTOMER CONVENIENCE AND IMPORTANTLY THE INCREASED EMPLOYMENT IT COMES FROM INCREASED PRODUCTION. EACH INDIVIDUAL CRAFT DISTILLERY IS TOO SMALL TO BE PROFITABLE TO DISTRIBUTORS WE CANNOT SCALE TO MEET THE DEMAND DISTRIBUTORS MUST HAVE MAKE PITCHING OUR PRODUCTS WORTH THEIR EFFORT WE KNOW BECAUSE WE'VE TRIED. THIS IS A CLASSIC CHICKEN AND EGG DILEMMA WITHOUT THE PROMISE OF DISTRIBUTION WE CANNOT AFFORD TO EXPAND PRODUCTION YET WITHOUT EXPANDED PRODUCTION WE CANNOT MEET THE DEMAND REQUIRED FOR DISTRIBUTION. THIS IS ALSO. WHERE DTC SALES CAN HELP WE CAN INCREASE PER PROFITABLY WELL BUILDING A BRAND AND TRY ALL. WHICH ULTIMATELY WILL MAKE US MORE APPEALING TO DISTRIBUTORS. FINALLY WINERIES HAVE ENJOYED THIS BENEFITS SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX AND WE ALL KNOW HOW VALUABLE THE WINE INDUSTRY IS THE CALIFORNIA WE ARE SIMPLY ASKING FOR PARITY WITH OUR BROTHER IN THE WINE INDUSTRY. SO PLEASE CONSIDER MAKING DTC SALES AND SHIPPING PERMANENT. IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT- I'M JUST GOING TO.
