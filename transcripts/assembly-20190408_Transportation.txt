WHERE YOU'RE AT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- AB ELEVEN EIGHTY THREE CLARIFIES DEFINITION A VESSEL OPERATOR CLOSING A DANGEROUS LUPONE ALLOWING THE LEGISLATURE TO HOLD VESSEL OPERATORS -- ACCOUNTABLE FOR DANGEROUS BEHAVIOR ON THE STATE WATER WAYS THE HARBORS A NAVIGATION CODE ALLOW SPECIFIED MINERS TO OPERATE A VESSEL UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS IF THE MINOR IS ACCOMPANIED BY AN ADULT WHO IS AT LEAST EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE AND WHO IS ATTENTIVE AND SUPERVISING THE OPERATION OF THE VESSEL THE COAST DEFINITION OF OPERATOR IS THE PERSON ON BOARD WHO IS STIRRING THE VESSEL WELL UNDER WAY THE INTERPLAY OF THESE TWO STATUES MEANS THAT THE ADULT SUPERVISING THE MINOR WHO WAS OPERATING THE VESSEL IS NOT TECHNICALLY THE OPERATOR UNLESS THE ADULT IS DURING THE VESSEL THIS MEANS THAT RECKLESS BEHAVIOR ON THE WATER WAYS SUCH AS A LACK OF SUPERVISION DRINKING OR OTHER DANGEROUS BEHAVIOR CAN GO UNCHECKED DUE TO LOOSE DEFINITION OF OPERATOR AB ELEVEN EIGHTY THREE SIX TO CLARIFY THIS DEFINITION TO ENSURE THE BEHAVIOR THAT PUTS OTHER PEOPLE AT RISK CAN AND WILL BE ACCOUNTABLE IN DOING SO THIS BILL WILL IMPROVE THE SAFETY OF OUR WATER WAYS AND THE SECURITY AND PEACE OF MIND FOR ALL THOSE WHO ENJOY THEM WITH ME TODAY THIS IS A MOOT TESSLER FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION THE SPONSOR OF THE BILL AND LIEUTENANT DAVID COOK THE COMMANDER OF CONTRA COSTA COUNTY'S MARINE SERVICE UNIT AND CO CHAIR OF THE STATE SHARES BOATING AND WATER CRAFT SAFETY COMMITTEE TO PROVIDE THE PERSPECTIVE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS WHO WORK ON OTHER ON OUR WATER WAYS EVERY DAY YEAH BUT WITNESSES TODAY MYSTERON I HAVE WITNESSES HERE RESEARCH IN NEW YORK AFTER MINISTER CHAIR MEMBERS WHO SHALL MUCH LOWER ON BEHALF TO CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION ARE PLEASED TO BE THE SPONSORS OF AB ELEVEN EIGHTY THREE -- AND WE WANT TO THANK SYMBOL MAIL RAMOS FOR -- OFFERING THIS LEGISLATION -- AS HE I MENTIONED WE DO HAVE THE TEN AND DAVID COOK HERE WITH US I'M FROM THE CONTRA COSTA OFFICE OF SHERIFF WHO OVERSEES ADD THESE OPERATIONS AND HE'S HERE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS ON THE MEMBERS MAY HAVE THANK YOU AND WE AT RICHARD YOUR IPHONE ON THIS LEGISLATION START VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO COME BEFORE YOU IN -- TEST FRIDAY AND I'D LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALMOST FOR AUTHORING THE BILL IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE TEACHERS ASSOCIATION FOR SPONSORING IT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION -- TO CLARIFY HAVE ON THE WATER WAY TO BE SAFE OPERATING VESSEL OR SUPERVISING A MINOR ONE RESPONDED WHEN -- OPERATING VESSEL -- SO THAT -- IS OPERATING A VESSEL SOMEBODY IS AVAILABLE AND RESPONSIBLE AND ABLE TO TAKE CONTROL THE VESSEL SOMETHING GOES WRONG THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU FOR THAT ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT WOULD LIKE TO TEST FINDS FORTY AUTHORS BILL THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC LIKE TO TESTIFY OPPOSITION OR HAVE CONCERNS OF THE AUTHORS BILL SEEING NONE MIST -- WILL TAKE ME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE CAN QUESTIONS OF MR ALMOST O'DONNELL YES SIR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST A COUPLE QUESTIONS HERE SO AND AND I THINK MAYBE THIS IS BETTER FOR FOR FOR THE SHERIFF IF IF I COULD -- SAID SO THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL IS TO COULD YOU JUST WALK ME THROUGH WHAT BUT THE INTENT IS HERE YES SIR -- SO THE WAY LAW CURRENTLY READS OF A VESSEL -- THAT PERSON IS THE PERSON WHO'S ACTUALLY IN PHYSICAL CONTROL THE VOTE -- HOWEVER THE LAW DOES ALLOW FOR FIFTEEN ILLEGALLY OPERATE A BOAT AS LONG AS THAT PERSON IS UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A RESPONSIBLE ADULT SO THE WAY LARA'S RIGHT NOW IS A TWELVE YEAR OLD A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD CAN OPERATE THE BOAT -- BUT THEY HAVE TO BE UNDER SUPERVISION WITH SOME OF THE THE SUIT THE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES SUPERVISOR CAN'T BE HELD RESPONSIBLE AS THE OPERATOR IT IS SO THAT TOLD A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD WOULD NOT NEED A VOTERS LICENSE UNDER CURRENT LAW THEY ARE THE BILL UNDER THE CIVIL DISTRICT IN YEAR OLD HAS TO BE UNDER SUPERVISION BUT CURRENTLY DOES NOT REQUIRED TO HAVE A BOATING SAFETY CARD OKAY OKAY THAT'S THE VOTING LICENSE THE NEW THING IT'S SO YES SIR IT'S THE IT'S THE RIGHT SAFETY IT'S A SAFETY EDUCATOR HARDER OKAY -- SO THERE ARE SEVERAL PEOPLE ON BOARD OF ABOVE THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN WE WOULD BE THE VESSEL OWNER TWO OR JUST ONLY THAT TWELVE TO FIFTEEN YEAR OLD GOT THE TERM CONFUSE LIKE WHAT WHAT TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T COVER JUST EVER VOTE RIGHT NOW THE WAY THE LAW READS IF A BOAT IS A DRAFT WHICH MEANS THE -- THE PERSON WHO WOULD BE THE OPERATOR OR MAYBE THE ONLY PERSON ON BOARD GOES TO WORK THE RATING -- OR CHANGE SOME OTHER STATUS ON THE BOAT THAT PERSON TO TECH TECHNICALLY NOT THE OPERATOR BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE THEIR HANDS ON THE CONTROLS ABOUT BUT THEY'RE THE ONLY PERSON THERE WHO'S COULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE THE SAFE CONDUCT OF THE VOTE SOME REALLY WITH THE TWELVE TO FIFTEEN YEAR OLD -- SOMEBODY HAS TO BE RESPONSIBLE THERE SOBRE AND ABLE TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE VOTE IN CASE OF EMERGENCY SO THIS BOAT DOES THIS VOTE SPEAK TO SOBRIETY IN ANY IT'S COVERED UNDER THE TENETS OF THE BILL IS NOT NECESSARILY DOESN'T IDENTIFY THE GOAL IS TO DEFINE THE PERSON WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT MINOR AS AN OPERATOR AND AS AN OPERATOR THAT RESPONSIBILITY WAS OVER SO IF I HAVE A BOAT AND I TURN IT OVER TO ANOTHER PERSON TO TO TO -- TO PILOT IN THIS PERSON KNOWS HOW TO DRIVE A VOTE THIS PERSON'S VOEPEL EXPERIENCE AND THEY DO SOMETHING NEFARIOUS WHEN MY BACK'S TURNED AND GET INTO HARM'S WAY OR SOMETHING THAT'S ILLEGAL WHAT I THE OPERATORS TO BE HELD LIABLE I GUESS THE KEY PIECE OF INFORMATION SIR WOULD BE WHO IS WHO IS A PERSON CURRENTLY OPERATING ABOUT IS THAT PERSON AUTHORIZED OPERABLE IF THEY'RE TWELVE TO FIFTEEN YEARS OLD THEY CAN'T THEY CAN'T BE THE OPERATOR BECAUSE THEY CAN ONLY OPERATE UNDER SUPERVISION THE ONE THEY'RE NOT I MEAN THIS IS THE ONLY SPEAK TO THAT TWELVE TO FIFTEEN ONE NOW -- IN THE CONTEXT AYE AS I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING YES SIR WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT TRYING TO CREATE A GREAT A LIABILITY TO THE OWNER OF THE BOAT VERSUS SOMEBODY WHO LEGALLY OPERATING ABOUT A PERSON LEGALLY OPERATING ABOUT HAS A VOTER CARD AND THAT PERSON IS IN PHYSICAL CONTROL THEN THE INVESTIGATION WOULD LEAN TO THAT PERSON BEING THE OPERATIVE ABOUT SO TOOK DOES THE BILL SPEAK TO THE TWELVE TO FIFTEEN YEAR OLD THAT'S WHERE HAVE USES COVER EVERY AGE OR IS IT JUST AIMED AT THE TWELVE TO FIFTEEN YEAR OLD THE WHICH I BELIEVE AS THE LAW WAS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN PEOPLE OUTSIDE THAT GAP ARE ALREADY ALREADY CAPTURED THEY WOULD THE OPERATOR THE BOAT THIS IS A PERSON WHO HAS THEIR HANDS ON CONTROL AS WELL WILL BE LABOR THE POINT EITHER I'M JUST A LITTLE CONFUSED ON WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO CAPTURE LISTEN I'M SUPPORTER IF IT IS -- IT AND I'M A VOTER AND I TURN MY VOTE OVER TO TO PEOPLE MORE THAN ONCE AND SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT PEOPLE SWIMMING YOU'VE GOT TO YOU KNOW WAIT DOWN YOU'VE GOT TO GO TEND TO THEM AND AND AND MAYBE YOU'D THROAT NEUTRAL RUN BACK OR MAYBE YOU GIVE YOU KNOW YOU LET SOMEBODY ELSE PILOT VÀ SO I SAID THAT'S WHY I'M CURIOUS IS WHAT WHAT THIS REALLY CAPTURES ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS SAYS THE PERSON WHO IS AT LEAST EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE AND WHO WAS ATTENTIVE AND SUPERVISING THE OPERATION OF THE VESSEL BY A PERSON TWELVE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE PURSUANT TO SPECIFY PROVISION OKAY SO THE INTENT IS TO CAPTURE THAT CERTAIN ADRIN IN ANY OKAY THANK YOU AND ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO THE PERSONAL WATERCRAFT ISSUES ON THE WATER I THINK IS POSITIVE SO I HOPE THIS SPEAKS TO THAT TOO BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE REAL IT'S A REAL CHALLENGE OUT THERE ON OUR WATER IS THAT WHAT WE CALL SEEN THAT'S RIGHT FLYING ALL OVER THE PLACE AND AND OFTEN WITH KIDS AND THEY'RE NOT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THESE DON'T HAVE BREAKS YOU'RE ON THE WATER RIGHT SO -- OKAY I THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR AND THANK YOU TO THE SPONSOR THANK THE OTHER QUESTIONS OF THE FROM THE

SIDE THIS BILL WILL ACCOMPLISH THE FOLLOWING ONE CREATE A MECHANISM FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO TRACK SITE SHOWS AND A CLEAR PATH FOR ENFORCEMENT TO OUTLINE PENALTIES FOR PARTICIPATION INCLUDING ORGANIZING THIS RECKLESS BEHAVIOR THREE DETER SIDESHOW ACTIVITIES FROM CONTINUING -- THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL CRIMES AND A SIDE SHOW IS THE ELEMENT OF BLOCKING FREE MOVEMENT AND THE ROAD TO OTHER PEOPLE IF A PERSON IS RESPONSIBLE FOR BLOCKING ACCESS TO TRAFFIC AND SOMEONE DIES THERE SHOULD BE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES THE CONDUCT IN A SIDE SHOW IS MORE THAN JUST STREET RACING THE BUT RECKLESS ACTIVITY WHERE INDIVIDUALS DON'T COMPLY WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PUT LIVES AT RISK WITH ME IN SUPPORT IS JONATHON FELDMAN FROM THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION AND BRANDON APP FROM THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT BUT -- BEFORE THE OF MY WITNESSES SPEAK MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ALLOW FOR THE BRIEF VIDEO I WANTED ALL THE MEMBERS -- -- TO ON THE COMMITTEE

COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND IN SUPPORT ON BEHALF OF OUR DEPARTMENT -- WE'RE NO STRANGER TO THESE THESE INSTANCE OF SIDESHOWS IN FACT -- WE'VE HAD SOME INSTANCE DOWN SOUTH THAT MADE SOME SOME

JONATHON FELDMAN ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION WE HAVE ALSO SPONSORED BILLS ON SIDE SHOWS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS -- INDICATIVE OF THE FACT THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM STATEWIDE IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN ASKING THE LEGISLATURE FOR HELP WITH TRYING TO ADDRESS THE PENALTY SYSTEM THAT'S IN PLACE FOR WHATEVER IT'S WORTH IS NOT -- EFFECTIVELY DETERRING THE BEHAVIOR YOU KNOW WERE SEEN SIDE SHOWS -- PROMOTED ON SOCIAL MEDIA -- AS SHOWS THAT HAVE RESULTED IN DEATH OR GREAT BODILY HARM TO THE BYSTANDERS AND PARTICIPANTS IN AGAIN WE'RE ASKING FOR SOME HELP IN ENSURING THESE DOWN AND AND PROTECTING THE STREET SO WE ASK WHERE I VOTE THANKS THANK YOU ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE AUTHORS BILL SEEING NONE ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC STILL LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND WE REPRESENTING PLEASE GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS KATHY SURE ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA WHO PARTICIPATE INSIDE CHOSEN AND SPEED CONTESTS ARE ALREADY SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL PENALTIES UNDER EXISTING LAW WHERE SOMEONE INJURES OR KILLS SOME SOMEONE IN THE COURSE OF ONE OF THE SIDE SHOWS -- IN MOST CASES FELONY PENALTIES WOULD APPLY A SEVERE INCREASE IN THE PENALTIES SUCH AS PROPOSED IN EIGHTY FOUR TEN WILL DO NOTHING TO DETER THE ACTIVITIES AND QUESTION BEYOND WHAT IS ALREADY IN EXISTING LAW AND WILL ONLY RESULT IN LONGER JAIL AND PRISON SENTENCES AT GREAT COST TO THE STATE AND NO BENEFIT TO PUBLIC SAFETY IN ADDITION I WOULD POINT OUT THAT THIS BILL CRIMINALIZES A BROAD ARRAY OF BEHAVIOR AS AIDING AND ABETTING A SIDE SHOW INCLUDING ORGANIZING FACILITATING ENCOURAGING OR PROMOTING A SIDE SHOW THIS COULD RESULT IN INDIVIDUALS BEING PROSECUTED FOR SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS JUST BE SHARING TO FACEBOOK POSTER TELLING SOME FRIENDS ABOUT THE EVENT WE ARE JOURNAL VOTE THANK YOU FOR THAT ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC FEEL LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION OF THE AUTHORS BILL SEEING NONE OF MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR MR GRAYSON THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I DO WANNA THANK -- THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND AND I CAN SEE WHY IT'S AN TRANSPORTATION -- I JUST WANT TO STATE THAT -- I FULLY SUPPORTED FROM THE TRANSPORTATION PERSPECTIVE -- THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS THAT I'D I HAVE AS WELL -- BUT I DO UNDERSTAND THIS IS GOING TO BE ALSO HEARD IN ANOTHER COMMITTEE SO BASED ON HOW THAT THE COMMITTEE TURNS OUT AND THE LANGUAGE AND HOW IT GETS TIGHTENED UP A LITTLE BIT -- I LOOK FOR THE REMAINING AND AND FULL SUPPORT OF THE BILL AS IT HOPEFULLY REACHES THE FLOOR THANK YOU THE STRUGGLE I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I TUNE GOING TO BE VERY SUPPORTIVE I'VE DRIVEN DOWN THE ONE TEN OR THE ONE OH FIVE MORE THAN ONCE AND SEEN CIRCLES AND YOU ALWAYS WONDER WHAT TIME DID THAT HAPPEN RIGHT AND I'VE SEEN WHERE THEY ACTUALLY DO SHOW YOUR CORRECTLY TO SHUT DOWN THE FREEWAY AND THEN PUT ON THE SHOW AND THEN GET OUT OF THERE WITHIN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME I JUST THINK THERE ARE SOME CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES OF PARTS OF THE BILL THAT I I HOPE YOU DO -- ADDRESSES IT HEADS DOWN THE PATH THANK YOU I DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING CONTINUING TO WORK WITH ACLU AND SEE WHAT MEDIUM WE CAN GET TO THAT MAKES US BOTH A CONTENT MISTER CUNNINGHAM THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AS ONE IF THE SUPPORTERS OR THE AUTHOR COULD ADDRESS THE ARGUMENTS PUT FORWARD BY A SEAL YOU SPECIFICALLY WHETHER EXISTING LAWS LIKE RECKLESS DRIVING EXHIBITION OF SPEED AND THERE'S A THIRD ONE I THINK THAT WAS CITED -- WHY THEY'RE INADEQUATE TO COVER THIS PARTICULAR TYPE OF CONDUCT WE ASK THE US FOR SILICON IF YOU'RE FOR STILL HARBORS CONCERN I STILL THINK THAT THERE ARE THE PUNISHMENT IS IS STERN ENOUGH -- YOU CONDUCT A YOU KNOW KIND OF SOMEWHAT CONTROL THREE SIXTIES IN THE MIDDLE OF AN INTERSECTION YOU INJURE SOMEBODY AND THE MAX TIME YOU'RE LOOKING AT IS YOU KNOW SIX MONTHS -- WE JUST DON'T THINK IT'S OF OF ENOUGH ENTER A DETERRENT WE THINK JUST AS TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE OOMPH BEHIND THE PUNISHMENT THIS IS NOT THERE RIGHT NOW THAT BUT AND ALSO I'D LIKE TO ADD THAT THERE REALLY ISN'T RIGHT NOW ANY SECTION IN THE CODE THAT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES THIS SO UNFORTUNATELY THIS ACT GETS MISLABELLED MEAN FORGET ABOUT THE PENALTY PORTION FOR A MINUTE -- THERE ISN'T ANYTHING THAT CITATION THAT REALLY ACCURATELY DENOTES THIS ACT AND HAS A COMMON CODE SECTION NEXT TO IT TO BE REFERENCED SO THAT WE CAN ALSO COLLECT DATA TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE IMPACT OF THIS INCREASING OUR ACT IS TO RIGHT NOW EVERY JURISDICTION LABELS IT WHAT IT SEIZE IT FIT SO IT'S CREATING AN INCONSISTENCY AND IT'S LOSING THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH OF A RISE THERE IS IN THIS ACTIVITY SO IF I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING SOME COUNTIES OLES SE PEOPLE FOR RECKLESS DRIVING SOME WILL CITE THEM FOR TWENTY THREE ONE ON AYE EXHIBITIONS BE SOME SIGN FOR SOME OTHER THING AND THE WRITTEN SO CONSEQUENTLY THERE'S NO WAY TO GET A HANDLE ON HOW WIDESPREAD THIS

THOUSAND OR JUST EIGHTY PERCENT OF WHAT WE NEED EXISTING LAW REQUIRES THE PROVIDER OF ANY V. CHARGING STATION TO ACCEPT PAYMENT VIA CREDIT CARD OR MOBILE TECHNOLOGY OR BOTH THIS ENSURES OPEN ACCESS TO CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE WITHOUT MANDATING ONE SPECIFIC TECHNOLOGY HOWEVER THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD HAS PROPOSED A REGULATION WHICH WOULD MANDATE ALL EXISTING AND FUTURE PUBLIC CHARGING STATIONS TO BE OUTFITTED WITH PHYSICAL CREDIT CARD READERS WHILE I APPRECIATE THE A ARBY'S WORK ON THIS ISSUE THE REGULATION WOULD RESULT IN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT ARE DETRIMENTAL TO THE STATE'S EAGLES SPECIFICALLY THIS REGULATION WOULD REQUIRE EXISTING PUBLIC CHARGING STATIONS TO BE RETROFITTED REPLACED AT A COST OF SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS PER CHARGER ACCORDING TO THE A. ARBY'S ANALYSIS THIS WILL COST NEARLY ONE HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS AND TAKE VALUABLE EXISTING CHARGING STATIONS OUT OF OPERATION IT WOULD AT LEAST DOUBLE THE COST OF FUTURE CHARGING STATIONS AB FOURTEEN TWENTY FOUR WOULD PRESERVE EXISTING LAW AND IS FOR OPEN ACCESS TV CHARGING STATIONS IT WOULD PROVIDE DRIVERS WITH MULTIPLE PAYMENT OPTIONS WHILE AVOIDING THE COSTLY SETBACKS OF A CREDIT CARD READER MANDATE AB FOURTEEN TWENTY FOUR REQUIRES CHARGING STATIONS TO BE EQUIPPED WITH A TOLL FREE NUMBER FOR CREDIT CARD PAYMENTS TAKEN OVER THE PHONE IN AT LEAST TWO ADDITIONAL PAYMENT METHODS INCLUDING OUR IF ID CARDS MOBILE APPLICATIONS OF VEHICLE TELEMATICS AND ONSITE CAPACITY FOR CREDIT CARD PAYMENT A PHYSICAL CREDIT CARD READER IS AN OPTION BUT NOT A REQUIREMENT I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING CLOSELY WITH MY OFFICE ON THIS BILL SHOULD THE COMMITTEE MOVE THIS BILL FOR TODAY WE WILL CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO WORK TOWARD A COMPROMISE THAT ADVANCES ACCESS TO EVEN CHARGING STATIONS ACROSS CALIFORNIA RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE NINE WITH ME TODAY I AFRAID NO WHERE FROM THE SALON THAT LEADERSHIP GROUP AND RICHARD SHORE SKI FROM ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING ASSOCIATION THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS FRED NO WE'RE REPRESENTING THE SILICON VALLEY LEADERSHIP GROUP AND WE'RE HERE TODAY AND VERY PLEASED TO SUPPORT AB FOURTEEN TWENTY FOUR TO ENSURE THAT ALL PUBLIC CHARGING STATIONS IN CALIFORNIA WILL MEET MODERN PAYMENT REQUIREMENTS CALIFORNIA HAS A GOAL AND THE LEADERSHIP GROUP SUPPORTS THE DEPLOYMENT OF ONE POINT FIVE MILLION ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND FIVE MILLION BY TWENTY THIRTY IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE DIVERT DEPLOYMENT GOAL TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND PUBLIC EVEY CHARGING STATIONS ARE NEEDED GIVE ME THIS CALL AND ENABLE EVEY ADOPTION CHARGING STATIONS ARE BEING INSTALLED BY BUSINESSES AND GOVERNMENT ENTITIES ACROSS THE STATE LARGELY IN MUNICIPAL PARKING GARAGES RETAIL CENTERS BUSINESSES UNIVERSITIES AND MULTI FAMILY HOUSING OUR MEMBER COMPANIES HAVE INSTALLED CHARGING STATIONS AND MANY OF THEIR WORK PLACES THAT ARE USED BY BOTH THEIR EMPLOYEES AND THE PUBLIC THE AIR BE HAS ANNOUNCED A PROPOSED RULE TO REQUIRE ALL PUBLIC CHARGING STATIONS BE REMOVED AND REPLACED WITH STATIONS THAT ARE OUTFITTED WITH CREDIT CARD READERS OR FACE A HEFTY FINE THIS WOULD CENTER STATE BACK IN THE NUMBER OF STATIONS DEPLOYED WHILE COSTING BUSINESSES MONITOR DOLLARS TO REPLACE PERFECTLY FUNCTIONING STATIONS THE LEADERSHIP'S GROUP SUPPORTS INNOVATION PAYMENT METHODS AND TECHNOLOGY AND WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT DRIVERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO CHARGE THEIR CARS IN A CLEAN AND EFFICIENT WAY FOR THIS REASON SILICON VALLEY LEADERSHIP GROUP SUPPORTS THIS BILL WHICH UPDATES A LAW PASSED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN TO ENSURE THE DRIVERS CAN NOW ACCESS ALL PUBLIC CHARGING STATIONS THROUGH MULTIPLE PAYMENT OPTIONS INCLUDING NEW TECHNOLOGIES LIKE A CONTRACT LAST CREDIT CARDS IN NEAR FIELD COMMUNICATION ON A MOBILE DEVICE THE ARBY'S PROPOSAL SETS THE STATE BACKED THIS BILL WOULD MOVE THE STATE FORD RAPIDLY BEER IN SUPPORT AND WE WOULD RESPECT LATER TONIGHT THANK YOU THANKS WHAT IS PLEASE GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS RICHARD CHOI SKI ON BEHALF OF THE U.

FOURTEEN TWENTY FOUR SIEMENS HAS EIGHTY TWO CALIFORNIA LOCATIONS THAT INCLUDE MOST OF YOUR DISTRICTS WE MANUFACTURE AND ASSEMBLE EVEY CHARGERS IN CALIFORNIA USING INCLUDING USING A MINORITY OWNED BUSINESS SUBCONTRACTOR SEMEN STRONGLY SUPPORTS UNIVERSAL NON DISCRIMINATORY ACCESS TO PUBLIC CHARGERS WHAT THE BILL WOULD DO IS PERPETUATE A SYSTEM OF CLOSED PROPRIETARY PAYMENT TECHNOLOGIES CURRENTLY IN USE THAT PUBLIC CHARGING STATIONS MANY OF WHICH WERE INSTALLED USING PUBLIC FUNDS HOW FOCUSED ON TECHNOLOGY INCLUDING THE COSTS THAT WOULD RESULT FROM AN ARBY'S DRAFT REGULATIONS REQUIRING AN EMV CHIP CARD READER THAT WOULD SUPPORT NOT ONLY CREDIT AND DEBIT CARDS BUT ALSO PREPAID CARDS MAKING THOSE CHARGERS ACCESSIBLE TO ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF CALIFORNIANS SOME CLAIM A CARD READERS INSECURE AND WOULD INCREASE FRAUD ON THE CONTRARY ACCORDING TO MASTER CARD HIM THE CHIP CARDS HAVE REDUCED FRAUD BY SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT MOREOVER SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF CHIP CARDS FORTY PERCENT OF FRAUD A SHIFTED ONLINE THE MASTER CARD THERE IS NO OTHER PAYMENT METHOD THAT IS SAFER FOR CONSUMERS THAN EMV CHIP CARDS SOME ALSO CONTEND THAT PHYSICAL CARDS ARE BECOMING OBSOLETE BUT ONLY SIXTEEN PERCENT OF AMERICANS HAVE USED A DIGITAL WALLET ACCORDING TO JP MORGAN EVEN IN THE EUROPEAN UNION WHICH IS A DECADE OR MORE AHEAD OF THE U.

THE ADOPTION RATES ONLY FORTY FIVE PERCENT APPLE JUST ANNOUNCED ITS OWN CREDIT CARD NOW WHY WOULD THE WORLD'S MOST INNOVATIVE COMPANY LAUNCH A PRODUCT THAT SUPPOSEDLY OBSOLETE HOLD TECHNOLOGY FINALLY THE PROPONENTS CONTEND IT'LL COST A HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION TO RETROFIT CHARGERS THIS IS THE WORST CASE SCENARIO MORE CHARGES WOULD HAVE TO BE RIPPED OUT AND REPLACED AT AN ESTIMATED UNIT COST OF SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS HOWEVER USING ACTUAL PUBLISHED DATA FOR LAST YEAR THAT UNIT COSTS WOULD BE ONLY NINETEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS MAKING THE WORST CASE SCENARIO LESS THAN FORTY MILLION FOR NEW CHARGERS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE TOTAL INSTALLED COSTS THE COST INCREASE TO ENSURE UNIVERSAL ACCESS YOUR CARD READERS WOULD BE LESS THAN FOUR PERCENT IN CONCLUSION I ASK YOU HONORABLE MEMBERS WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU HAD TO PROVIDE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION THE CHEVRON -- SHELL TO FILL YOUR CAR WITH GAS THEN WHY SHOULD CALIFORNIANS BE REQUIRED TO DO THAT FOR CHARGING THEIR TV'S WE URGE YOU TO VOTE NO THANK YOU OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC FEEL LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THE -- AUTHORS BILL PLEASE TAKE YOUR NAME AND WHO YOU REPRESENT PLEASE MARK TAYLOR WITH THE GOLDEN GATE ELECTRIC VEHICLE ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL SIX WITH THIS -- GARLAND REPRESENTING GREEN LAUGHS -- WERE LEADING PROVIDER EVEY CHARTING SOFTWARE AND SERVICES MARKET FOR TRANSPORTATION LITIGATION IN CALIFORNIA AND IS INVOLVED IN CHARGING HIS DENTURE DEPLOYMENTS ACROSS THE STATE I'M HERE TODAY TO COMMUNICATE OUR OPPOSITION THE PRESENT FORM OF THIS BILL -- GREEN MUST TESTIFIED BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE SIX YEARS AGO IN SUPPORT OF SB FOUR FIVE FOR WHICH THE INSTEAD PROPOSED LEGISLATION WITH UNDERMINE EVERY PLACE -- WELL THE REPROCESS DEVELOPERS AND SLOW THE AIR RESOURCE BOARD LET PROCESS -- HAS A LOT ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO SAY THEIR PIECE AND -- ON THIS ISSUE -- AS SUCH WE AGREE WITH THE COMMITTEES -- ANALYSIS THAT THIS BILL MAYBE THE MATURE AND INDEED -- SUBMIT THAT IT THAT IT ACTUALLY IS RICHER SO FOR THESE REASONS -- WE -- DO NOT SUPPORTED IN ITS CURRENT FORM AS IT SUPERSEDES CARD ONGOING MILITARY PROCESS AND AS SUCH GREEN NOT SO IT IS IF YOU TAKE SPEAKER PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME WE REPRESENT PLEASE HI GOOD AFTERNOON I'M CATHERINE GARCIA WITH SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS AND SUPPORTERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA A WE WERE IN SUPPORT OF SB FOUR FIFTY FOUR AND -- WITH THE CURRENT ITERATION OF AB FOURTEEN TWENTY FOUR OUR MEMBERS ARE IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS AARON RODRIGUEZ FOR THE UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS WE BELIEVE THIS BILL IS PREMATURE AND CARP SHOULD FIRST COMPLETE THE REGULATORY PROCESS FOR THESE REASONS WE OPPOSE WHAT WE LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH OTHERS THANK YOU IF YOU'RE TWITTER JUST COULDN'T SAY THAT HI HANNIBAL SMITH AND THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA ELECTRIC TRANSPORTATION COALITION WE DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE A POSITION ON THIS BILL BUT WE WANTED TO WEIGH IN AND SAY THAT WE THINK THAT CONVERSATION THAT HAS BEEN SPARKED BY THIS BILL IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT -- THERE NEEDS TO BE AN APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN REGULATION GOING ON IT CARP AS WELL AS ENSURING THAT THE STATE'S FOCUS IS ON ACHIEVING RAPID ACCELERATION AND EXPANSION OF CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE TO METERS OF GOALS WE DO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE CURRENT PROPOSAL AT THEIR RESOURCES BOARD PARTICULARLY FOR EXISTING STATIONS -- SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO ENGAGE IN THIS PROCESS THANK YOU THANK YOU HERE THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC FEEL LIKE TO TESTIFY OPPOSITION OR CONCERNS OF THE BILL SEEM NONE QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE AUTHOR PART CARP HERE THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM CAR NO WELL MAYBE YOU CAN ADDRESS THIS -- -- IN IN IN IN TERMS OF THIS BILL MY CONCERN IS THAT WE HAVE THESE CHARGING STATIONS THAT REPAIRS AND TAXPAYERS PAY TO PUT IN AND THEN NOW LET'S CERTAIN KERR WAS ASKING FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF THEM -- AT TAXPAYER COSTS SO CAN IT THAT THAT'S MY THAT'S WHY I'M SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I'M OF COURSE WOULD LIKE SOME COULD BE MADE TO TO TO -- TO MAKE THE OPPOSITION -- YOU KNOW ME DOUBLE TO THAT TO TO TO SUPPORTING THIS BILL IN THE FUTURE I'M SUPPORT OF IT HI MY VIEW IS THAT FROM A GOOD GOVERNMENT STANDPOINT IN ITS TWO IS THE TAX DOLLARS -- WE CAN BE YOU KNOW HAVING USING TAX ARE TO PUT IN CHARGING STATIONS AND THEN USING TAX DOLLARS TO TAKE HIM OUT THANK YOU ARE SOMEONE OVER FONG AND I AGREE WITH YOU A THOUSAND PERCENT THAT'S ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS WHY I INTRODUCED THE BILL -- AND CAR REGULATIONS ARE GOING IT WOULD BE REQUIRED -- TO RIP OUT ANY CHARGING STATIONS THAT DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE CREDIT CARD -- A CREDIT CARD OPTION IN THE THE COST OF THAT WAS QUESTIONED BY THE OPPOSITION BUT IT'S CARBS OWN NUMBERS THAT STATE IT WOULD BE SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS PER CHARGER FOR A TOTAL OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN WASTED TAXPAYER MONEY THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE RIPPED OUT BECAUSE THEY DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE A CREDIT CARD AND THE REASON THEY DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE CREDIT CARDS EVEN THOUGH -- SB FOUR WAS MISREPRESENTED BY THE OPPOSITION SB FOUR FIFTY FOUR CLEARLY STATES THAT YOU CAN HAVE A CREDIT CARD OR YOU CAN HAVE A DIFFERENT PAYMENT METHOD IT'S NOT AN AND IT'S IN A WAR I THINK WE ALL KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A HAND IN A WAR AND BECAUSE AS BEFORE FIFTY FOUR HAD THAT THAT MEANS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF CHARGING STATIONS OUT THERE THAT DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE A CREDIT CARD PAYMENT METHOD -- AND SO THAT'S THAT'S -- YOU KNOW WHY MY BILL IS FRANKLY MORE ACCESSIBLE THAN AB ARE THEN AS BEFORE FIFTY FOUR WAS BUT ALL SIX MORE THOSE COMING TO A CLOSE I AM I APPRECIATE THE ANSWER AND SAID I'VE MET WITH THE OPPOSITION AND I'M ON I'M SYMPATHETIC IN TERMS OF MOVING FORWARD WITH ANY NEW CHARGING STATIONS IF IF THEY PROVIDE CREDIT CARD OPTIONS ARE NOT -- HOPEFULLY THAT IF THEY DO BOTH AND I'M OF COURSE SUPPORT OF THAT BECAUSE HE CERTAINLY -- IN THE CENTER VALLEY FOR EXAMPLE -- YEAH MAYBE PEOPLE THAT NEED TO USE THAT AND SO FOR ME IF THERE'S SOME WAY THAT WE CAN DO WE CAN MAKE CHANGES THE BILL -- THAT SOMETHING THAT WOULD MAKE THE BILL BETTER I'M OFF SUPPORT OF IT SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU BRIDGET YEAH THE OPPOSITION SIDE WE HAVE SIXTY THREE OKAY I'M SORRY HE WASN'T DIRECTLY THE QUESTION DO YOU KNOW IF YOU MUST ADDRESS A QUESTION TO THE WITH MY APOLOGIES THANK YOU BERMAN WAS LIKE CLOSE YEAH THE -- QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION BUT IT'S IMPORTANT WOULD BE CLEAR ABOUT A COUPLE OF FACTS -- THE OPTIONS LAID OUT A B. FOURTEEN TWENTY FOUR OR STRONGER IN TERMS OF ACCESSIBILITY IN CONSUMER CHOICE AN EXISTING LAW AND THE PROPOSED REGULATION WE WANT TO MAKE A LECTURE VEHICLES ACCESSIBLE TO FOLKS IN ALL COMMUNITIES ACROSS ALL INCOME LEVELS AND THE PAYMENT STANDARDS UNDER AB FOURTEEN TWENTY FOUR DO NOT REQUIRE DRIVERS TO HAVE A SMARTPHONE TO USE AND EASY CHARGING STATION BUT IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT SMARTPHONE OWNERSHIP IS MORE UBIQUITOUS IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THAN CREDIT CARD OWNERSHIP IS SIXTY BURKE SEVEN SIXTY SEVEN PERCENT OF ADULTS EARNING LESS THAN THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OWN A SMARTPHONE ACCORDING TO THE PEW RESEARCH CENTER AND ONLY SIXTY PERCENT OF HOUSEHOLDS EARNING LESS THAN FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ON A CREDIT CARD ACCORDING TO FEDERAL RESERVE DATA FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN SO CREDIT CARD READER MANDATE WOULD NOT PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL COVERAGE FOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES -- I ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF THE COST THAT WAS RAISED EARLIER -- ALL TO SAY THAT WE ALL WANT TO REACH OUR STATE'S ELECTRIC VEHICLE GOALS TAKING EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE OUT OF OPERATION TO BE REPLACED IN ADDING COSTS IS NOT HOW WE GET THERE AB FOURTEEN TWENTY FOUR WILL REDUCE UNNECESSARY COSTS BARRIERS AND SHORE OPEN ACCESS TO CHARGING STATIONS IN ADVANCE CALIFORNIA'S ELECTRIC VEHICLE GOALS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE THANK YOU MISTER BERMAN ALL THIS FOR YOUR BILL TODAY YOU KNOW THE -- WITH THE WRONG AMOUNT OF CHARGING STATIONS NOT ENOUGH YEAH HANDED LIKE TO TAKE THAT OTHER HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS AND ACTUALLY CAPTURE INFRASTRUCTURE WHEN WE HAVE THESE HUGE MANDATES MOVING FORWARD AND I'VE HAD CONSTITUENTS ACTUALLY COMPLAIN TO ME THAT THEY'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO CHARGE BECAUSE THERE'S TOO FEW AND FAR BETWEEN SO WHEN WE LOOK AT ADVANCING A TECHNOLOGY I DON'T WANNA PUT PARAMETERS IN IN PLACE AND ACTUALLY PREVENT US FROM MOVING FORWARD I WOULD THINK THAT WE WANT TO PUT THE CART BEHIND THE HORSE AND ACTUALLY GET INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE BEFORE WE HAVE ALL OF THESE CARS THAT I'M SUPPORTIVE OF BUT ONLY IF THEY CAN BE UTILIZED IN A PRACTICAL FASHION WITH THAT I KNOW THIS POLICY IS NOT PERFECT I WANT YOU TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WILL COME TO A COMPROMISE OUR BALANCE BUT RIGHT NOW EVERY TIME THAT THESE AGENCIES PUT ANOTHER SEE OR COST ON THE CONSUMER MAKES IT FURTHER AND FURTHER UNATTAINABLE THAT'LL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL AND SECRETARY PLUS WE HAVE A FIRST MISTER GRAYSON SECOND WITH MISTER NAZARIAN -- MAPS OKAY PLEASE CALL THE MOTION IS TO PASSED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS FRAZIER RAISE YOUR AYE FONG FONG I THANK YEAR CURRY HI

IS THIRTY WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN OF FRAPH SO MEMBERS BREAK DO REALLY ASK YOU TO WORK THE OPPOSITE ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU AB FORTINO SEVEN PLEASE BECAUSE -- PROCEED WITH DIRECT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS -- SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THIS BILL WILL LAST YEAR THIS IS THE -- THE SAME BILL I'M VERY PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO BRING IT BACK THIS YEAR A RECKLESS DRIVING ILLEGAL STREET RACING HAVE BEEN AN ONGOING PROBLEM IN MY DISTRICT AND MOSTLY PROBABLY IN YEARS AS WELL A DRIVERS PUTTING THE PUBLIC IN HARM'S WAY EVERY TIME THEY SPEED THROUGH A NEIGHBORHOOD RACE ON INTERSTATE OR PARTICIPATE IN A SIDE SHOW AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT IMPOUNDING VEHICLES HOUSTON STREET RACING SERVES AS AN ATTACK EFFECTIVE TOOL TO DEFER TO DETER THE BEHAVIOR FOR TWO REASONS IT'S COSTLY TO RETRIEVE A VEHICLE FROM AND POUND AND IT LIMITS THE DRIVER'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO RACE AND ANECDOTALLY WHEN WE SPEAK TO LAW ENFORCEMENT MY OWN DISTRICT THEY SAY THAT A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN HAVE NO PROBLEM PAYING THE FINE THEY'RE MAKING MONEY IN THE STREET RACING THEY'RE MAKING MONEY FROM THE SIDE SHOWS SO PAYING A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR FINE IS NOT AN ISSUE FOR THEM BUT HAVING THEIR CAR IMPOUNDED FOR THIRTY DAYS THAT'S A REAL DETERRENT IN ADDITION THIS BILL WILL BE THE FIRST TIME THAT THE LAW WOULD REQUIRE THAT ANY ILLEGAL MODIFICATIONS MADE TO MAKE -- THESE VEHICLES -- INTO RACE RACE CARS INSTEAD OF JUST REGULAR STREET CARS THIS IS THE FIRST BILL THAT WOULD REQUIRE THOSE MODIFICATIONS TO BE REMOVED BEFORE THE CAR IS RETURNED TO ITS OWNER AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN YOU GET A CAR BACK TO CAN GO THREE TWO MILES AN HOUR AND YOU KNOW HOW IT IS ALL TRICKED OUT YOU'RE JUST ASKING FOR TROUBLE SECOND THANK YOU I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU MS FREEMAN -- GIVE ME WITNESSES OKAY MEMBERS THE PUBLIC FEEL LIKE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE AUTHORS BILL GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN RESOLUTION MUCH LONG HAVE THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT GREG TURNER ON BEHALF OF TRIPLE A NORTHERN CALIFORNIAN SUPPORT ATTENTION FOR THE AUTO CLUB OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ALSO IN SUPPORT THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT OF THE PUBLIC WHO WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME IN THE REPRESENTING PLEASE GOOD AFTERNOON CATHY SURE FOR THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA WITH REGARD TO IMPOUNDMENT THIS BILL DOES ONE THING IT DID NUYS JUDGES THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE THEIR DISCRETION TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE LENGTH OF EMPOWERMENT OF THE VEHICLE -- IF THE JUDGE FINDS IN A CASE NOW -- FOR THESE CRIMES THAT IMPOUNDMENT FOR THIRTY DAYS IS THE BEST THE BEST LENGTH OF TIME FOR IMPOUNDMENT THE JUDGE CAN CAN DO THAT BUT THEY CAN ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENSE AND THE OFFENDER AND DECIDE THAT A LESSER IMPOUNDMENT WILL SERVE THE PURPOSES -- OF OF THE COURT -- EMPOWERMENT OF THE VEHICLE AND ESPECIALLY FOR AS LONG AS THIRTY DAYS ALL TOO OFTEN BECOMES A DE FACTO FORFEITURE OF A VEHICLE AS MANY DEFENDANTS ARE UNABLE TO PAY THE STORAGE FEES CHARGED WHEN A VEHICLE IS HELD FOR THAT LONG LOSS OF A VEHICLE WHETHER FOR THIRTY DAYS OR AS MAY BE THE CASE PERMANENTLY CAN RESULT IN THE DEFENDANT LOSING A JOB OR BEING UNABLE TO FILL FELT FULFILL FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES -- WELL THE BILL ALLOWS THE JUDGE SOME DISCRETION WHEN EMPOWERMENT WILL RESULT IN HARDSHIP FOR THE FAMILY IT DOES NOT ALLOW THE JUDGE TO CONSIDER HARDSHIP TO THE DEFENDANT OR WHETHER THE DEFENDANT WILL BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO GET THE CAR BACK AFTER THIRTY DAY IN TOWN THEN JUDGES SHOULD RETAIN THE DISCRETION THEY HAVE UNDER EXISTING LAW TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PENALTY IN EACH CASE INCLUDING WHETHER AND FOR HOW LONG TO IMPOUND THE VEHICLE WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE FOR YOUR NO VOTE THANK YOU -- ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION OR HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE AUTHORS BILL ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE AUTHOR THIS ARE YOUR CURRENT -- I LIKE YOUR BILL BECAUSE THE FACT THAT ONCE YOU IMPOUND YOU HAVE TO TAKE OFF ALL THE EXTRA EQUIPMENT THE MAKES IT FASTER AND I DON'T KNOW WHATEVER IT DOES -- BUT I I THINK THAT THAT'S A REALLY GOOD PIECE OF IT THAT IT -- IMPOUNDS A BILL WHEN IT GETS RETURNED YOU GOT IT PRETTY MUCH STRIPPED DOWN TO A FACTUAL ON MOBILE THANKS THE THE OTHER QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE MISTER CUNNINGHAM SAID JUST TO CLARIFY THE THE EXEMPTION FOR THE SECOND RECKLESS DRIVING CONVICTION WOULD BE LIMITED TO FINANCIAL HARDSHIP FOR THE FAMILY ON UNDER THE THERE'S ACTUALLY A WHOLE LIST OF EXEMPTIONS THERE'S FINANCIAL HARDSHIP THERE'S ALSO IF THE VEHICLE IS THERE SOME EXEMPTIONS THERE'S EXEMPTIONS OF THE VEHICLE WAS DRIVEN BY SOMEONE OTHER THAN THE REGISTERED OWNER SO IF YOUR CHILD TAKES THE CAR SO THERE ARE OTHER SORT OF OUTS FOR JUDGES TO CONSIDER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ISRAEL WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I JUST TO SAY THAT I DO APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS FROM THE ACLU WE HAVE TRIED TO ADD EXEMPTIONS SO THAT WE WOULD -- TRY TO PREVENT THESE KINDS OF OF YOU KNOW AND REASONABLE HARDSHIPS BUT AT THE SAME TIME THIS IS A GROWING PROBLEM AROUND THE STATE IT'S A PROBLEM THAT LEADS THE LOSS OF OF PEOPLE'S LIVES AND DRIVING THE CAR IS A PRIVILEGE NOT A RIGHT AND WHEN WE HAVE CHILDREN BEING RUN DOWN IN INTERSECTIONS IN LOS ANGELES WHEN WE HAVE PEOPLE CONVICTED OF MISDEMEANOR RECKLESS DRIVING WHICH IS NOT ROLLING A STOP SIGN THIS IS PEOPLE WHO ARE DRIVING WITH A WANTON DISREGARD FOR OTHERS IT'S ONE OF THE TOP CONCERNS IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD WE'VE HAD REGULAR BASIS IN GLENDALE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IT'S A IT REALLY IS BECOME A CRISIS AND YOU
