A GRANT PROGRAM- IN THE BASIS OF A POTENTIAL JOB CREATION AND BY TRAINING R. Y. ELLA- PHONING- TWELVE TO TWENTY FOUR MONTHS OF A PERIOD THE SO SUMMARY I READ HERE BUT I WONDER HOW YOU PLAN TO PROVIDE THE FINANCIAL BASE IS SO FULL OF THE GRANT. BECAUSE IT'LL TAKE MONEY YEAH I MEAN IT'S SO IT'S ONLY GOES IN AFFECTED SORRY TO THE CHAIR- IT GOES INTO EFFECT UPON A PREPARATION OF THE BUDGET- SO WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT. AT WHAT THAT'S ALL KIND OF- UNDER CONVERSATION RIGHT NOW THE GOVERNOR HAD PUT IN SOME MONEY AND HIS INITIAL BUDGET AND- I'M SO IT'S TIED IN WITH HIS IT WITHOUT INITIAL LAST BUT IT'S NOT SPECIFIED YET. OH OH I SEE SO YOU DON'T KNOW THE HOW MUCH AND NO- WHETHER THAT'LL BE- FUNDED BY THE TAXABLE FROM FROM THE INDUSTRY- OCCURS- DONATION IS OF FOUR AS I LOOK A SCHOLARSHIP FORMAT. WELL IT'S A GRANT- FORMAT BUT I DO LOVE THE IDEA OF A OF A- SERVER HYBRID FINANCING MODEL ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT YOU SUGGEST MAYBE SOME PUBLIC PRIVATE FINANCING. I'M SO. THAT'S STILL THAT'S STILL BEING AS HAVING WORKED OUT RIGHT NOW NICE IS THIS IS JUST AN IDEA THEY'RE SORTED OUT CREATE THE JOB BUT AN INTERNAL WHY THEY ARE THIS PROGRAM WILL ALLOW. THE POTENTIAL ARTESIA THROUGH TO LEARN. THE INDUSTRY WELL RIGHT AND TO GET RIGHT AND STRESS THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT AND WE THERE WAS A- SIGNIFICANT ASK IN THE ARTS BUDGET SOME OF WHICH WOULD BE FUNDED SOME SOME OF SOME OF THAT SO THAT MONEY WOULD HAVE TO FIND THIS KIND OF PROJECT. BOB AS THEY SAY IT'S STILL SUBJECT TO NEGOTIATIONS. OKAY SO THE ALWAYS- PROMOTER AND A SUPPORTER OF- A SMALLER BUSINESSES OR ANY PROGRAMS SO AND EVENTUALLY JOB CREATION I THINK THIS HAS. GOOD POTENTIAL OF CREATING MORE JOBS SO AS LONG AS YOU CAN COME UP WITH A VERY SOUND PROGRAM. NOT ONLY- INSTEAD- INSTEAD OF FUNDING pBE GOOD TO GO AND CAR ENCOURAGE RATHER THAN POORLY RELYING UPON. A TAXPAYERS MONEY SO I THINK I SAID I HAVE A SUGGESTED THAT I THINK THAT THIS IS A REALLY THE A TYPE OF PROGRAM- THE INDUSTRY- ITSELF WE SHOULD BE INTERESTED IN. CREATING FUTURE JOB WHAT FORCES SO THERE MAY BE YOU KNOW IF WE CAN CREATE. OUR LACK OF THE NATION AND- TAX DEDUCTION AND ENCOURAGE THEM YEAH YEAH I OR FOUNDATIONS AS WELL I MEAN I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT MAYBE YOU AND I CAN SIT DOWN AND GO OVER CUT LEAD THAT EVERY RIGHT. EVERY GRAYSON KALRA AND ON THAT BASIS I'LL BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BOULDERS. AND THINK I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL'S.

ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO FOR MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES AS WELL. YEAH I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION AND I AND I I'M AND YOU MAY BE ONE OF THE THINGS TO LOOK AT IS PEOPLE ENTER YOU KNOW KIND OF AT THE END EARLY STAGES. AND YOUNGER PEOPLE WHO MIGHT REALLY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES AND- AND JUST BECAUSE- NO THEY DON'T GROW UP IN. ABSOLUTE DESTITUTE DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY CAN'T. ABSOLUTELY AND- BENEFIT FROM IN THE FACT. THAT WE NEED A PROGRAM LIKE THIS SO. I'M HAPPY THAT TO LOOK AT HOW WE CAN EXPAND THE LANGUAGE IN A WAY THAT.

MY STAFF AND I HAVE WORKED MANY HOURS MANY DAYS AND REALLY HAVE REALLY COME TO A NICE AGREEMENT THIS BILL DOES TWO CRITICAL THINGS FIRST AND ALLOW THE SMALL SMALL NONPROFIT PERFORMING ARTS ORGANIZATIONS TO INTER INTER GRANT PROGRAMS. AS WE KNOW THE COVERED NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS DEVASTATED THESE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO OPEN LAST YEAR AND REALLY RELY ON FUND RAISING EFFORTS AND SO THIS BILL REALLY IS A LIFELINE TO HELP THEM STAY OPEN AND HELP THEM TAKE CARE OF THEIR EMPLOYEES. UNDER THIS PROGRAM THIS BILL FOCUSES ON THE SMALLEST MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND IT DOES REALLY GIVE THEM. SOME HOPE SO THEY CAN CONTINUE AND BE SUCCESSFUL. ONCE IT'S ESTABLISHED ALL THE ORGANIZATIONS CAN PAY INTO THIS PAYMASTER THERE WILL BE CREATED AND IT WILL ALSO BE COST NEUTRAL AS THEY ENTER INTO THIS MASTER PROGRAM. BY CREATING ECONOMIES OF SCALE PARTICIPATING NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS WILL BE ABLE TO CUT DOWN ON THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS BY USING THE SAME PROGRAM. HOLLY'S I ALSO WANT TO SHARE THAT THIS IS A LITTLE BIT PERSONAL. TO ME. I GREW UP IN DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES AT A TIME. WHERE DRUGS VIOLENCE EVERYTHING YOU DON'T WANT YOUR LITTLE GIRL NEXT TO WAS VERY PREVALENT. AND I WAS A VERY CREATIVE CHILD VERY EXPRESSIVE AND I WAS ABLE TO PUT THAT ENERGY INTO. POSITIVE WAYS AND I FOUND THE ART. AND SO LUCKILY BECAUSE I HAVE THAT OUTLET I WAS ABLE TO DO POSITIVE THINGS WITH MY LIFE. BUT I ALSO KNOW. THAT THESE ORGANIZATIONS ARE REALLY NOT ONLY HELPFUL TO THEMSELVES BUT ALSO TO THE SURROUNDING BUSINESSES AND COMMUNITIES- I STARTED ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO WHEN FASSEL SAID ONO. AND THE HEART OF BOYLE HEIGHTS CAME BACK IN A COMMUNITY THAT WASN'T DESIRABLE AT THE TIME. AGAIN IT WAS A LOT OF GANGS AND DRUGS AT THE TIME BUT I SAW THE LABOR OF LOVE. OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS NOT JUST IN BOYLE HEIGHTS BUT ACROSS OUR STATE AND THERE IS ABOUT. TWO THOUSAND THAT WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS PROGRAM. I'M AND I ALSO WANTED TO SHARE THAT WHEN I WAS. THEIR ACOSTA TWENTY YEARS AGO IT WAS INCREDIBLE TO SEE HOW. HOLE FIFTEEN A LOPEZ WHO OPENED THIS LITTLE THEATER EMBRACED ALL THOSE ARTISTS THAT DIDN'T HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE LITERACY TO TOOK ALL THOSE KIDS THAT DIDN'T HAVE A PLACE TO GO. I REALLY OFFERED A SAFE PLACE FOR THEM TO COME AND LEARN. REALLY IT ALSO GAVE A VOICE AND A PLATFORM TO ALL THOSE ARTISTS THAT DIDN'T HAVE EXPERIENCE. THEY WANTED TO GO FURTHER. BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT MONEY. IT REALLY IS ABOUT EQUITY IN ACCESS TO THOSE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AS WELL AS SOCIAL JUSTICE I KNOW. ADDITIONALLY THE PERFORMING ARTS HAVE BEEN A POWERFUL TOOL FOR THOSE VOICELESS AND HISTORICALLY MAJOR SOCIAL MOVEMENTS IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY HAVE. RELIED ON PERFORMING ARTS TO ELEVATE THE COSTS AND TELL THEIR STORIES WE CAN GO BACK TO THE WOMAN SUFFRAGE WHEN THEY WERE ENGAGING WEALTHY AFFLUENT FAMILIES TO JOIN THEIR CALLS AND HELP THEIR MOVEMENT TO BRING EQUAL RIGHTS TO WOMEN. THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT WAS ALSO KNOWN AS AN ERA OF CREATIVE ACTIVISM. THEY USED EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER THEY USE THEATER STRONG IMAGERY POETRY SPOKEN WORD. BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO CONVEY THEIR STORY AND WHAT THEY NEED IT. IN RETURN AT THE OPERA COMPASS EMAIL. IS A SMALL NONPROFIT THAT STARTED IN THE FIELD AND HELPED ORGANIZE THE FARMWORKERS TO GET BETTER PAY AND BETTER WORKING CONDITIONS. AND DURING THIS PANDEMIC A LOT OF THE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE NOW THREATENED TO CLOSE WERE USED BY COMMUNITIES TO EDUCATE. FOR EXAMPLE PROCESS SAID ONO AS I STATED IN THE HEART OF LOW HEIGHTS WAS HIRED BY L. A. COUNTY TO EDUCATE ABOUT THE VACCINE AND COVERT NINETEEN. SO TO ME IT IS UNDENIABLE. THAT PERFORMING ARTS GO HAND IN HAND WITH SOCIAL MOVEMENTS AND PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN OUR SOCIETY. AT A LOCAL LEVEL THEY PROVIDE ACCESS TO POOR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES THE INVITE SCHOOL THEM PROVIDE CLASSES AND WORKSHOPS FOR CHILDREN THAT OTHERWISE WOULD NOT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. AND AS A CLASSROOM TEACHER I CAN SHARE WITH YOU. THAT THE ARTS LITTLE BY LITTLE HAVE BEEN DISAPPEARING IN OUR SCHOOLS AND SO WE NEED THESE ORGANIZATIONS TO CONTINUE TO BE PARTNERS. AND CONTINUE TO EDUCATE TO CREATE WELL ROUNDED INDIVIDUALS. SO TODAY I HAVE THE HONOR OF HAVING TO DISTINGUISH GAS. FIRST I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE LARA STOPPER SHE'S CURRENTLY SERVES AT THE INTERNET SOCIO DIRECTOR UNTIL JULY FIRST FOR THE CENTER FOR BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT. OF THE ARTS CLAREMONT GRADUATE UNIVERSITY AND A LONGTIME ADVOCATE. I ALSO HAVE MICHELLE. CRUZ SICK WHO MOST RECENTLY PLAYED ANNA MAY WONG IN THE NETFLIX SERIES HOLLYWOOD SHE PRESENTLY SERVES. THE FBI DIRECTOR MARK SHOP FOR WOMEN'S ADVOCATES FOR API ISSUES SUCH AS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS. SO IF THEY MAY THE AUTHOR OF MODERATOR. PLEASE WELCOME OUR GUESTS. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M LORD SECTOR CAN YOU HEAR ME YES. GREAT THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK IN ADDITION TO BEING THE INCOME ARE COMING DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT OF THE ARCTIC CLAREMONT GRADUATE UNIVERSITY I'M ALSO FORMERLY. THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF ARTS AND CULTURE FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND I'M SPEAKING IN STRONG SUPPORT OF S. B. EIGHT FIFTY AND I JUST WANT TO ALSO MENTION HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE THE PASSAGE OF SB SIX TWENTY EIGHT. THANK YOU. SENATOR RUBIO PEER LEADERSHIP AND WORKING WITH A LARGE COALITION TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER NIZARI AND- FOR YOUR CONTINUING SUPPORT ON THIS ISSUE AS YOUR CONSTITUENT FROM SHERMAN OAKS. I GREATLY APPRECIATE YOUR FORWARD THINKING REPRESENTATION AND I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T MENTION SENATOR ALAN. AND THE OTHER MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE WHO HAVE WORKED SO HARD TO ADVANCE THE ARTS SECTOR. THIS MEASURES FORWARD THINKING ON THIS COMMITTEES PART. BECAUSE IT NOT ONLY IS ABOUT CORRECTING PAST SYSTEMIC INEQUITIES IN FUNDING FOR SMALL THEATERS A SYSTEM THAT MANDATES SPENDING IS ALWAYS IN RELATION TO BUDGET SIDE ENSURING THAT SMALL ORGANIZATIONS STAY SMALL. AND IT'S NOT ONLY ABOUT PROVIDING IMMEDIATE CRITICAL RELIEF FOR THE CURRENT ISSUES BROUGHT ON BY THAT THE PANDEMIC ISSUES YOU KNOW THREATEN THE SURVIVAL OF THE CREATIVE LIFE BLOOD OF OUR STATE. AND WHILE IT'S TRUE THAT THIS MEASURE WILL PROVIDE EMPLOYMENT OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS FOR MORE THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND OF THOSE WORKING IN THE TRENCHES AT SMALL NON PROFITS. IT'S MORE THAN THAT. IT'S A BRIDGE. THAT WILL ALLOW SMALL THEATERS TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO EMPLOY PEOPLE AT LIVING WAGES IN THE FUTURE BEYOND TO THIS PROGRAM. BECAUSE OF THESE FUNDS ALLOW BUDGETS TO GROW IT WILL MAKE NONPROFIT THEATERS ELIGIBLE FOR GREATER SUPPORT FROM DONORS AND FOUNDATIONS. IT'S GOVERNMENT FUNDING WILL SIGNIFICANTLY LEVERAGE PRIVATE SECTOR SUPPORT PROVIDING A PATHWAY TO SUSTAINABILITY. THE MEASURE WILL FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE GAME FOR OPERATING THEATRES IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE CRIED QUADRUPLE BOTTOM LINE OF BENEFITS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING YOUR COMMENTS IN TAKING ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. THANK YOU WE HAVE OUR NEXT WOULD WITNESS AND. IN PERSON. SURE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR A SEEN ME IT'S ACTUALLY VERY IMPORTANT TO ME THAT YOU SEE ME TODAY BECAUSE AS AN ASIAN AMERICAN WOMAN I AM USED TO FEELING INVISIBLE IN THIS COUNTRY AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE AS AN API WOMAN I AM AN ARTIST BECAUSE I HAVE MOSTLY EXPERIENCED INVISIBILITY AS PART OF MY IDENTITY AS AN AMERICAN AND I FIGHT FOR VISIBILITY AS AN ARTIST I AM AN ACTOR WRITER AND NOW DIRECTOR AND I AM INTERESTED IN CREATING NARRATIVES FOR MARGINALIZED PEOPLE AS WELL AS MY OWN COMMUNITY. MY STORY IS THAT IN TWO THOUSAND ONE I WROTE A SOCIAL CALLED MADE IN TAIWAN IT WAS ABOUT MY CRAZY DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY AND AT THE HEART OF IT IT WAS A COMEDY REALLY ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE- I WOULD THEN LATER GO ON TO BECOME AN ADVOCATE FOR DOMESTIC MYSTIC RUNS AWARENESS BUT- THIS SHOW STARTED MY CAREER IT GAVE ME CREDIBILITY. GAVE ME ACCESS TO RESOURCES. AND WHAT I. DEVELOP TO THE SHOW IN SMALL THEATERS THROUGHOUT LOS ANGELES. AND LATER TWENTY YEARS LATER I WOULD BECOME PART OF THE MORE MAINSTREAM- IDENTITY OF HOLLYWOOD- BUT YOU HAVE TO BEGIN SOMEWHERE AND TO FOR ME AS A YOUNG ARTIST WHERE I STARTED WERE IT WAS IN THE SMALL THEATERS. AND NOT EVERYONE GETS ACCESS TO THE RESOURCES I WAS ABLE TO HAVE. AND MOST ARTISTS WHEN THEY'RE NOT WORKING COUPLE EVERYTHING THEY HAVE SO THEY CAN GO BACK TO THE THEATER TO WORK. ON THEIR CRAFT BECAUSE THESE THEATERS ARE INCUBATORS FOR IDEAS AND THEY GROW ARTISTS SO THAT THEY CAN BECOME. AWARE OF WHAT THEIR VOICES AND HOW TO HAVE A VOICE IN THE LARGER INDUSTRY. THEATER COMPANIES. LINK ARTISTS TO THE AUDIENCE AND THIS INFRASTRUCTURE IS VITAL BUT WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO ME IN MY EXPERIENCE IS THAT THEY ARE BUILDING COMMUNITY. AND THE CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE UNFOLDING IN THESE SMALL THEATER COMPANIES. THEY WILL CREATE A SYNERGY OF EXPERIENCE THAT THEN PERMEATE TO THE REST OF OUR CULTURE. IN CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY WE EXPORT CULTURE TO THE REST OF THE WORLD THAT IS HOW POWERFUL WE ARE IN THE ARTS. SO YOU ARE INVESTING NOT ONLY IN BUILDING THESE COMMUNITIES HOLDING TO THEM TOGETHER BUT LIKE SENATOR RUBIO SAID. GIVING THESE ARTISTS WHO DON'T HAVE OTHER PLACES TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES. YOU'RE GIVING THEM A PLACE IN WHICH THEY CAN BIRTH THEIR OWN IDENTITIES. AND I WOULDN'T BE HERE IF I DIDN'T COME FROM THE THEATER AND IF I WOULDN'T BE UTILIZING EVERYTHING I UNDERSTAND FROM THE THEATER RIGHT NOW AND EXPRESSING THESE IDEAS. SO PLEASE INVEST IN THESE SMALL COMMUNITIES DON'T UNDER ESTIMATE THE POWER AND VALUE THEY BRING. AND THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE HERE TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL YOUR WORK AND FOR YOUR BRILLIANT UP A CREATIVE. BEING THANK YOU. ALRIGHT WE HAVE- TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT DO WE HAVE ANY TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION. SINAN WE WILL INVITE OUR AUDIENCE IN SUPPORT.

A HAPPY TO MOVE. SUCH A MOTION TO MOVE A SECOND TO ANY OTHER COMMENTS ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOI. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW- CONCEPT IS- NOT GOOD SUPPORTING ON NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION IN PARTICULAR AND PERFORMING ARTS. THERE ARE SO MANY SMALL NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS- AND THE STATE OR EVEN IN THE COUNTRY. FOR A GOOD CAUSE. R. AND THEN ALSO DURING THE UP AND THEN MAKE A- MANY HAVE A CELL PHONE. BECAUSE OF OBVIOUS OF FINANCIAL REASONS- SO IT IS OUT OF COURT TIME THE FORTY TWO PERCENT- TO HELP WILL IS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS- AND- THE PERFORMING ASA- ABOUT THE- MY ONLY A PERFORMING ARTS A NONPROFIT SOCIAL KEPT AS THE STATE HOW. OUR WITH THE TAXPAYERS MONEY IF WE START DOING THAT THE ISN'T THERE ANY EQUITY ISSUE THAT THAT. I CAN COME UP WITH THE OR THE A SIMILAR APPEARANCE OF ALL OTHER SECTORS. HOW CAN WE MANAGE TO FUND ALL SMALL NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS SO IF WE STOP THE- TAKING OUT THE A SPECIFIC CAR INDUSTRY. WELL FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION AND THAT YOU KNOW OF COURSE I WOULD LIKE TO SAVE EVERY INDUSTRY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER GRANT PROGRAMS FOR DIFFERENT. REASONS YOU KNOW THERE IS GRANT PROGRAMS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND SO IN PARTICULAR I CHOSE THIS- BECAUSE YOU KNOW I WAS INTIMATELY INVOLVED WITH THESE ORGANIZATIONS- AND I FELT TO MENTION THAT I ACTUALLY PERFORMED MYSELF INTO THEATER LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND I SAW FIRST HAND WHAT THEY DID TO OUR- INNER CITY COMMUNITIES THE VALUE THEY BROUGHT HOW THEY KEPT THEIR KIDS OFF THE STREET AND TEST. THE POWER THAT THEY BRING TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR SO FOR ME IT WAS ABOUT TRYING TO CONTINUE THE GOOD WORK THAT THESE COMMUNITY ARTS PERFORMING ARTS- ORGANIZATIONS DO TO HELP THE UNDER SERVICE ON PARTICULAR FOR ME THAT'S BECAME IMPORTANT AS I MENTIONED AS A TEACHER. I SAW THE ARTS DISAPPEAR AND I KNOW HOW VITAL IT IS THAT WE CONTINUE TO ENGAGE OUR KIDS SO FOR ME THE CHILDREN ARE INNER CITY COMMUNITIES WAS TO WHY I WANTED TO DO THIS BUT- I AGREE WITH YOU WE NEED TO HELP A LOT OF PEOPLE AND WHAT THIS IS JUST CREATING THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR SMALL NONPROFIT COMMUNICATORS TO HELP THEMSELVES WE'RE JUST SETTING THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND WHICH THEY WILL PAY A FEE TO BE PART OF AN UNTAPPED. AND AGAIN THIS IS JUST GIVING THEM A LIFE. LINE FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS. THANK YOU OF US. MEMBER AN ASSYRIAN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IDEA I'D BE REMISS IF I JUST DIDN'T POINT OUT THAT- FIRST OF ALL- SMALL THEATERS ARE SMALL LITTLE HUMAN LABORATORIES- NOT JUST FOR THE PERFORMING ARTS BUT FOR MANY OTHER VITAL- COMPONENTS OF WHAT MAKES US INTO DECENT HUMAN BEINGS- MY WIFE AND I ENJOY GOING TO. FIRST OVER FORTUNATE TO BE LIVING IN A PLACE WHERE THERE ARE MULTIPLE SMALL LITTLE THEATERS IN THE AREA PART OF THE REASON FOR THE SMALL THEATERS IS BECAUSE IT'S THE ACTOR'S FUTURE ACTORS AND ACTRESSES. WORKSHOP AS THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO PERFORM AND TO BE ABLE TO BUILD A CAREER SLOWLY- IN SMALL STEPS SO IT'S EXTREMELY VITAL FOR US TO SUPPORT THESE PROGRAMS AND THEN SECOND. IF WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT DOLLARS AND- AND HOW VIS A INVESTING IN THESE PROGRAMS COME BACK TO BENEFIT US- I WOULD LOVE TO SEE NUMBERS BECAUSE I DO KNOW THE EXIST. ON TO WHAT EXTENT SUPPORTING SMALL THEATERS GENERATES MONEY BACK LOCALLY. BECAUSE FOR EVERY PERFORMANCE THAT STARTS AT SEVEN SIX PM THERE ARE DINNER RESERVATIONS STARTING AT FIVE FIVE THIRTY IN ORDER FOR PEOPLE TO GO OUT. ENJOY A MEAL TOGETHER AND COUPLES OR SEVERAL PEOPLE AND THEN GO OVER THANK I SEE RESTAURANTS PACKED- ANYTIME THERE ARE PERFORMANCES- LATER ON IN THE NIGHT ESPECIALLY FRIDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHTS AND SUNDAY. SUNDAYS NIGHTS AS WELL SO- I VERY MUCH SUPPORT THIS BILL AND- LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND- TO CONTINUE MOVING IT FORWARD. HEY WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND- ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. ALL JUST MAKE A FEW COMMENTS IN THE SENSE THAT I REALLY WANT TO APPLAUD THE- ARE SENATOR- WHO IS ALSO A FORMER ELEMENTARY TEACHER AS I AM AND- THEY SAW FIRST HAND. WITH OUR SMALL NON PROFIT- ARTS VENUES NOT JUST THEATER BUT OTHER STORYTELLING ALL MEET MUSIC. HOW IT REALLY CAN CHANGE LIVES I KNOW THAT THERE WAS A DONOR IN FULLERTON WHERE I TAUGHT FOR MANY MANY YEARS HE WOULD SOMETIMES BUY UP. A GOOD LOT OF TICKETS THAT WEREN'T BEING USED AND I WAS ABLE TO TAKE STUDENTS- THAT I HAD FOR THREE YEARS IN A ROW SAME STUDENTS I HAD FOR THIRD FOURTH AND FIFTH GRADE. TO NOT JUST ONE PERFORMANCE BUT MANY PERFORMANCES AT THIS LOCAL MUSICAL REPERTOIRE AND THOSE STUDENTS NOW WHO ARE YOUNG ADULTS HAVE SAID THAT SOME SEEN THIS LIVE PERFORMANCE AT THE LEVEL IT WAS REALLY WAS LIFE CHANGING. SO WE KNOW THAT THE ARTS CAN CHANGE LIVE WE KNOW THAT IT IS ALSO PART OF OUR CREATIVE ECONOMY. BUT THE ARTS ARE ABOUT STORIES ABOUT OUR LIVES AND WE JUST SEE THIS BLOCKBUSTER MOVIE COMING OUT IN THE HEIGHTS BUT THAT PARTICULAR ARTIST AND DIRECTOR AND PRODUCER ALL OF THEM STARTED SOMEWHERE. AND THEY DON'T ALWAYS START ON BROADWAY MANY OF THEM START AT SMALL NONPROFIT THEATERS AND THAT'S HOW WE BUILD THAT DIVERT DIVERSITY IN ORDER TO SHARE THOSE STORIES THAT REALLY ARE OUR AMERICAN STORIES. SO WITH THAT- I NOT ONLY SUPPORT S. B. NUMBER IS A- FIVE EIGHT OH FIVE BUT I THOUGHT THE- US SENATOR FOR HER DILIGENCE AND WE HAVE A MOTION. AND A SECOND MADAM SECRETARY.
