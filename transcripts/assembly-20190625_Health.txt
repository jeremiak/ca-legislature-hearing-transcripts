OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHTS WILL GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO TAKE THANK YOU AND YOURSELF FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS BILL IS MUCH APPRECIATED -- I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS SUGGESTED ON PAGE EIGHT OF THE COMMITTEE AND ALICE'S. AS YOU REMEMBER MAY REMEMBER SEVERAL OF YOU SAW A SIMILAR VERSION OF THIS BILL LAST YEAR SB TWELVE EIGHTY EIGHT WHICH WAS UNFORTUNATELY VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR. NURSE TO PATIENT RATIOS ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR BOTH THE COUNT WAS PATIENTS WHO SEE KAREN HOSPITALS AS WELL AS THE NURSES WHO WORK HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SB TWO TWO SEVEN EMPOWERS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. CD PH. I'M TO ENSURE PATIENT SAFETY BY ENFORCING MANDATED LONGSTANDING NURSE TO PATIENT RATIOS AND FINING HOSPITALS THAT REPEATEDLY BREAK THE STANDARDS. FROM 200-082-2000 SEVENTEEN THERE WERE A TOTAL OF SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR OUT OF RATIO DEFICIENCY ALLEGATIONS REPORTED TO C. T. CD PH. UNFORTUNATELY THE DEPARTMENTS PRESENT ENFORCEMENT MEASURES ARE SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH CURRENTLY THE DEPARTMENT CONDUCTS S. M. INSPECTIONS EVERY THREE YEARS. TO ENSURE THE HOSPITALS ARE COMPLYING WITH THE LAW THIS PERIODIC CHECK AS FAR TOO INFREQUENT AND ALLOWS HOSPITALS TO PREPARE BEFORE TWO CD PH OFFICIALS CONDUCT THEIR INSPECTIONS. SB TWO TWO SEVEN WOULD ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM BY REQUIRING THAT THE DEPARTMENT CONDUCT UNANNOUNCED VISITS TO INSPECT FOR COMPLIANCE WITHIN THEIR STAFFING RATIOS. THIS MEASURE WOULD ALSO EMPOWER THE DEPARTMENT TO ENFORCE THE STAFFING REQUIREMENTS WITH FINES IN CASES WHERE THOSE RATIOS HAVE BEEN VIOLATED. SB TWO TWO SEVEN IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT SO THAT WE CAN PROTECT PATIENT SAFETY. AND THE SAFETY HEARING CALIFORNIA HERE WITH ME IN SUPPORT IS GILBERT TEASED THE PRESIDENT OF SEIU LOCAL ONE TWO ONE ARE IN. MARK WINDOWS OF WITH SCA YOU AND FAITH CONCEPCION WITH UNIACKE. THAT RIGHT. OKAY VERY GOOD. THANK YOU SO IT TOTAL SIX SHE OF ALL THREE PLANNING TO SPEAK OUT OF TOTAL SIX MINUTES OKAY TOTAL OF SIX MINUTES. OKAY OKAY OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS -- AS JUST SAID MY NAME'S GILBERTESE AND I'M THE PRESIDENT OF SEIU LOCAL ONE TO ONE OR IN A UNION REPRESENTS REGISTERED NURSES THROUGHOUT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. I'M ALSO AN OPERATING ROOM NURSE AT NORTHRIDGE HOSPITAL MEDICAL CENTER AND IT BECAME A NURSE THIRTY SIX YEARS AGO BECAUSE I WANTED TO HELP. THE SICK TO CARE FOR THE SICK AND THE RUNNABLE. WHEN I STARTED WORKING AS A NURSE'S AIDE THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF HOSPITALS WAS PATIENT CARE? TODAY IT SEEMS THAT THEIR PRIMARY FOCUS IS PROFIT. HOSPITALS ARE NOTORIOUS FOR BREAKING THE LAW IN ORDER TO SAVE A BUCK. CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY STATE IN THE NATION WITH NURSE TO PATIENT RATIOS LAW. AND YET HOSPITAL'S ALWAYS BREAKING IT EACH TIME THEY PUT A NURSE OUT OF RACIAL NOT ONLY ARE THE BREAKING THE LAW. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THEY ARE PUTTING PATIENT SAFETY AT RISK. EVEN THOUGH THE NURSE TO PATIENT RATIO LAW WAS PASSED IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE THERE HAS NEVER BEEN AN ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM MECHANISM. IMPLEMENTED FOR IT. AND THAT IS WHY SOME HOSPITALS HAVE GONE SO FAR AS TO SAY TITLE TWENTY TWO IS A GUIDELINE OUR SUGGESTION. BUT NOT ACTUAL ALL. IN FACT SOME HAVE BEEN BOLD ENOUGH TO ASK NEW HIRES IF THEY WOULD BE WILLING TO GO OUT A RACIAL. I EQUATE THE RATIOS TO SPEAK. IF WE DON'T HAVE PENALTIES FOR VIOLATING SPEED LIMITS DRIVERS WOULD HAVE NO INCENTIVE TO FOLLOW THEM. AND THEN THEY'LL CONTINUE TO SPEED UNTIL ONE DAY SOMEONE GETS INJURED OR WORSE DICE. SO IF WE HAVE SPEEDING LAWS WHEN FORCE BUT MECHANISMS THAT PROTECT THE PUBLIC AGAINST RECKLESS DRIVERS. WHY DON'T WE HAVE THE SAME TO HOLD HOSPITALS ACCOUNTABLE FOR BREAKING THE LAW? THE NURSE TO PATIENT RATIO KAT CURRENTLY. WHAT IS THE VIOLATED A NURSE TO PATIENT LAWS ARE NEARLY NONEXISTENT? IN FACT MOST OF THE TIME WHEN A HOSPITAL IS FOUND TO BE IN VIOLATION OF THE NURSE TO PATIENT RATIOS. CITY PH GIVES THEM CITATIONS KNOWN AS PLANS OF CORRECTION. SURPRISINGLY THERE IS NO LIMIT ON HOW MANY PLANS OF CORRECTION A HOSPITAL CAN GET. THESE RATIOS AND ARE INTENDED TO KEEP OUR PATIENTS SAFE AND PRODUCE THE MOST OPTIMAL HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR THEM. AND THAT IS WHY I'M HERE TODAY TO ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB. TWO TWO SEVEN THE NURSESHERE TODAY THAT WILL SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE WILL ALSO ATTEST TO THE IMPORTANCE OF STAFFING RATIOS. AND HOW THEY PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF PATIENTS. CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO PROTECT OUR PATIENTS BETTER AND ENSURE THEY RECEIVE THE HIGHEST QUALITY OF CARE. IN FACT I HAVE RECENTLY RECEIVED AN EMAIL FROM A NURSE WHO WORKS IN THE NICK YOU. NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT WHICH IS THE NEWBORNS. MAKING US FOR HELP. THESE NURSES THAT CARE FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE OF THE VULNERABLE PATIENTS SICK BABIES. THERE ARE TIMES THAT THE HOSPITAL SO OUT OF RATIO THAT A NURSE IN THAT UNIT HAS ONE TO FOR A ONE TO SIX WHEN PATIENTS ARE IT SHOULD BE. AT THE MOST WANTED. TO BUT WHAT OUT ACTUAL PENALTY PENALTIES THE HOSPITAL WILL CONTINUE TO PUT THESE BABIES AT RISK [inaudible] IMAGINE. THAT WAS YOUR DAUGHTER YOUR SON YOUR NIECE OF YOUR NEPHEW OR YOUR GRANDCHILD AND THAT I SEE YOU. SB TWO TWO SEVEN WOULD CREATE A GREATER DISINCENTIVE BY INSTITUTING REPEAT OFFENDER LANGUAGE HOSPITALS THAT WILL FULLY AND CONSTANTLY VIOLATE NURSE TO PATIENT RATIOS. WOULD NOW FACE FINES DEPENDING ON HOW OFTEN THEY VIOLATE TITLE TWENTY TWO REGULATIONS LASTLY. SB TWO TWO SEVEN WOULD ALLOW CITY PH INVESTIGATORS TO CONDUCT UNANNOUNCED VISITS SO THAT THESE REPEAT OFFENDERS WON'T BE ABLE TO SKIRT THE LAW BEFORE THE STATE CAN INVESTIGATE VIOLATIONS. AS THE NURSES WE TOOK IN -- TO PROTECT AN ADVOCATE FOR OUR PATIENTS. AS I HELD SENATE COMMITTEE HEARING THE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION BLAME NURSES FOR BEING OUT OF RACIAL BECAUSE THEY WERE STUCK IN TRAFFIC OR BECAUSE THE NURSE LEAVES THE FLOOR TO GO TO THE BATHROOM OR TO LACTATE. AS A NURSE MYSELF I CAN TELL YOU FIRSTHAND IF THE NURSES RUNNING LIKE THE CURRENT NEWS CAR CARING FOR THE PATIENT WILL WHITE. WE DON'T JUST LEAVE THAT'S CALL PATIENT ABANDONMENT AND WE TOOK AN OATH AGAINST OUT. SB TWO TWO SEVEN IS SOUND POLICY OUTLINES WHAT ARE OPEN. IN ADDITION I'M NOT SURE OF THE HOSPITAL'S AWARE BUT NURSES ARE HUMAN BEINGS. TO AND WE NEED TO USE THE RESTROOM JUST LIKE ANYONE ELSE. IN FACT BY LAW A HOSPITAL IS SUPPOSED TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS IN THEIR DAILY STAFFING PLAN ON BEHALF. OF ALL THE NURSES OF S. YEAH YOU WANT TO ONE ARE AND AND THE ROUTE CALIFORNIA I RESPECTFULLY URGE YOU TO PASS. SB TWO TWO SEVEN TO PROTECT PATIENTS THANK YOU -- GOT TWO MINUTES [inaudible] SORRY. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN WOULD IN MEMBERS OF THE HEALTH COMMITTEE I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY SPEAK TO YOU TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL. TWO TWO SEVEN MY NAME IS FAITH CONCEPCION I WORK IN CRITICAL CARE I AM A REGISTERED NURSE. I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF THE UNITED NURSES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA IN THE I SEE YOU MY PATIENTS ARE CRITICALLY ILL AND OFTEN DEALING WITH EXTENSIVE INJURIES OR LIFE THREATENING DISEASES. OUR WORK ENVIRONMENT IS FAST PACED IT'S INTENSE AND IT'S STRESSFUL AS A NURSE AND I SEE YOU -- WERE REQUIRED TO BE HIGHLY VIGILANT OF OUR PATIENTS MONITORING FOR ANY CHANGES BIGGER SMALL THAT COULD POTENTIALLY AFFECT THEIR OUTCOME. THIS IS ALSO THE SAME SENTIMENT NURSES IN OTHER UNITS HAVE FOR THEIR PATIENTS MANY TIMES WE FACE SITUATIONS THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO SPEND TIME WITH THEIR PATIENTS DUE TO THE HOSPITAL'S UNDERSTAFFED BEING. LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE WE COME IN WITH THE EXPECTED RATIO OF TWO PATIENTS PER NURSE OR EVEN ONE PATIENT PER NURSE A PENDING ON THE SEVERITY OF THEIR ILLNESS. BUT ALMOST EVERY DAY WE STRUGGLE TO HAVE THE PROMISED BREAK OF THIRTY MINUTES AND TWO TEN MINUTE BREAKS ONE IN THE MORNING AND ONE IN THE EVENING. DUE TO UNDER STAFFING SOMETIMES WERE ASKED TO COVER ONE ANOTHER. PATIENTS WHILE THE OTHER NURSE GOES TO THEIR BREAK IN ADDITION THERE ARE SITUATIONS. WHERE A NURSE WILL COVER TO NURSES MEANING FOR PATIENTS SO HE'S COVERING FOR PATIENTS PUTTING HIM OR HER AT FOR PATIENTS THIS IS DANGEROUS ESPECIALLY NICE YOU AND ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN IN TEN MINUTES LET ALONE THIRTY MINUTES? THIS IS DANGEROUS FOR ME AS A NURSE AND FOR THE PATIENTS AND SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE QUALITY OF CARE THAT I'M ABLE TO PROVIDE TO MY PATIENTS. THIS IS A STORY NURSES KNOW TOO WELL BE SURE STAFF AND ULTIMATELY BEING FORCED TO SACRIFICE QUALITY OF CARE HOSPITALS ON ACCIDENTALLY SHORT STAFF IT'S A CALCULATED RISK THE ADMINISTRATION TAKES HOPING NO SERIOUS HARM HAPPENS. TO THE PATIENT BECAUSE ONLY THEN CAN A HOSPITAL BE FINE. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA DOESN'T HAVE A PENALTY FOR HOSPITALS WHO VIOLATE OUR STATE RACIAL ALL HOSPITALS KNOW THIS FACT TO WELL AN UNDERSTAFFED CONTINUOUSLY. SO WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE SIR BREAKS WE MISS OUR LUNCH WE MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY BREATHING COMPOSE OURSELVES IN A STRESSFUL ENVIRONMENT. AND IT'S NOT FAIR THAT WE COME TO WORK AND GIVE IT 1100% IN HOSPITALS ON STAFF 1100%. SO WE WANT -- TO SEE STAFFING EVERYWHERE IN SB TWO TWO SEVEN IS THE FIRST STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO VOTE YES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT JUST YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION PLEASE. MARY MILLER SERVICE LIKE MANY HOSPITAL AT FACILITY AND I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. JENNIFER LAURIE ARE IN KINDRED HOSPITAL OF SOUTH BAY. I SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. MONIQUE NICOLE HERNANDEZ RIVERSIDE COMMUNITY HOSPITAL ACA AND I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU.

MISTER CHAIR MEMBER SERRA FLOCKS CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MATT BROWN BE AFTER THE TEAMSTERS AND ENGINEERS AND SCIENTISTS OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. LOCAL BURGER CLOSE REGISTERED NURSE I'M A MEMBER OF THE UNITED YOURS IS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT OF TWO TWO SEVEN THANK YOU. STEVEN WEBER AND UP CALIFORNIA ASKS ME WE SUPPORT THIS BILL. CATHERINE USE REGISTERED NURSE DIRECTOR OF SCA UNIVERSAL LINES OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THANK YOU. THE ONE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL NURSES AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE. THREE ONE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. GET AFTERNOON CATHERINE'S CARBON IN THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WE ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL IMPRINT AND ARE REVIEWING THE AMENDMENTS HOWEVER -- OUR HOSPITALS DO WORK DAILY TO MEET THE RATIOS AND WORK WITH OUR NURSES I'M TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE PATIENTS. THE LAW IS AN OUT ALL TIMES LAW AND WE DO STRUGGLE WITH THAT AT ALL TIMES BECAUSE IT'S BASED ON THE PATIENTS ACUITY. AND A CUTIE FOR PATIENT CAN CHANGE AT ANY GIVEN TIME IT'S A DYNAMIC SITUATION ON THE FLOOR. AND AS WE MOVE NURSES TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS -- THERE ARE TIMES WHEN WE'RE STRUGGLING TO GET THERE AT ALL TIMES BUT WE PUT THE PATIENT FIRST -- AS OUR NURSES DO AS WELL -- ARE NURSES TO CALL IN SICK WE HAVE ABOUT A ONE IN FIVE TWO ONE IN FOR INSTANCE WHETHER COLIN SICK AND WE DO HAVE FLOW POOLS AND ACTION NURSES AND BREAK NURSES. AND THEY'RE STILL SITUATIONS WHERE -- WE MAY FIND OURSELVES OUT OF RATIO IN AN EFFORT TO PUT A PATIENT FIRST WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GET A BREAK -- IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES EVEN WITH THE VARIOUS BACKUP POOLS ARE HOSPITALS EMPLOY. I'M WHEN WE LOOK AT THE BILL AND NOW THE ANALYSIS STATED -- OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS CD PH HAS -- HAD WHAT ABOUT 1% OR LESS THAN THE THIRTY FIVE MILLION HOURS THAT HAVE BEEN WORKED OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS -- BUT WE ARE LOOKING AT THIS BILL -- AND THE AMENDMENT OFFERED BY THE COMMITTEE -- TO SEE IF THEY ADDRESS THE DYNAMIC SITUATIONS WE'VE BEEN TALKING THROUGH -- I THINK OUR CONCERN IS IS THAT -- HOUSE WE PUT THE PATIENTS FIRST AND HOURS ARE HOSPITAL'S WORK IN GOOD FAITH -- TO DO THAT THAT THEY'RE NOT IN TURN PENALIZED AT RATES THAT ARE SIMILAR TO OR OR BELOW THE RATE WRITTEN WHICH WE CURRENTLY HAVE THE SYSTEM -- WHICH USES PATIENT HARM SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAD A MEDICATION AIR -- AS STATED THE ANALYSIS IT WOULD BE A SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR PENALTY -- BUT IF YOU HAD A NURSE THAT NEEDED TO ADDRESS A PATIENT'S ACUITY -- AND WE THEN WERE HAD A GAP IN THAT RATIO WOULD BE A THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR PENALTY SO AS WE LOOK AT FOR THE SECOND VIOLATION OF THE LOOK AT THIS BILL WE THINK ABOUT THE CURRENT SYSTEM. WHERE THERE'S TO PUT DUPLICATION IN THE SYSTEM I'M IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM AND IN THIS BILL AND THEN HOW WE ADDRESS THAT FINE -- AMOUNT SO WE ARE LOOKING AT THE AMENDMENTS TO IT TOO I'M SEE IF THEY ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF THE DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH WE WORK AND WILL CONTINUE. TO ADDRESS THE THOSE CONCERNS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. AND HOW THEY GOT IS ALSO WITH KAISER PERMANENTE HEY WE'RE REVIEWING THE AMENDMENTS AS WELL BUT AT THIS POINT WE REMAIN IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU. JONATHAN CLAY ABOUT THE SCRIPTS HELP STUDIO -- RETURNING THE MINUTES AND THEN OPPOSITION STILL THANK YOU. I AM WORKING WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE DISTRICTS IN THE SAME POSITION WHERE REVIEWING THE AMENDMENTS THAT REMAIN OPPOSED THANK YOU. MEGAN OVER ON BEHALF THE UNITED POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION DID OUT TO THE POSITION OF MY COLLEAGUES THANK YOU. KAREN CIRCUITS YOU CAL CHAMBER AND WITH THE SAME SAME POSITION OR POST. MAYOR MARTIN WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL CESSATION SAME WE ARE OPPOSED IN LOOKING AT THE AMENDMENTS THANKS THANK YOU. TWENTY DELGADO I'M WE HAVE THE DISTRICT HOSPITAL LEADERSHIP FORUM SAME POSITION LOOKING AT A MINIMUM THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MY SHEPHERD ON BEHALF OF STANFORD HEALTHCARE SAME AND IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. AARON TAYLOR ABOUT THE MEMORIAL CARE HEALTH SYSTEMS ALSO IN OPPOSITION AND REVIEWING THE AMENDMENTS. MANUALLY ON BEHALF OF SUTTER HEALTH IN OPPOSITION ANYONE ELSE. SONORA BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] MISS KOREA. THANK YOU SENATOR LEYVA FOR BRINGING -- THIS BILL BACK TO BACK TO LIFE I'M PROUD TO JOIN AS A CO AUTHOR -- TO SHARE VERY QUICKLY -- A YEAR OR SO AGO MY GRANDMOTHER WAS VERY SICK AND CONSTANT VISITS TO THE HOSPITAL'S TO ACTUALLY IN MY DISTRICT. WHERE I SAW NURSES RUN AROUND -- WHAT APPEARED TO BE A LACK? OF STAFF -- AS WE TRY TO ASK QUESTIONS THEY WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE AND HELPFUL. BUT I ALSO FELT THAT -- THEY NEEDED A LITTLE BIT MORE SUPPORT -- I'M GLAD. THAT THE HOSPITALS ARE IN COMMITTEE ARE IN DISCUSSION AS TO HOW TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. I THINK EVERYONE IN THE ROOM WANTS TO KNOW THAT THE SAFETY. OF OUR FAMILY MEMBERS WHETHER IT'S FAMILY MEMBERS OR OUR SELVES IS THE PRIORITY. BUT THAT CAN'T HAPPEN IF NURSES ARE OVER WORKED. AND IF THERE'S AN UNDERSTAFFED THE STAFF. SO I HOPE THAT THERE'S A RESOLUTION I HOPE THAT WE CAN COME TOGETHER TO REALLY FULLY -- GET TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE ON THIS BILL SO THAT THE GOVERNOR SIGNED SAID AND ULTIMATELY. NURSES HAVE -- A NURSE TO PATIENT RATIO THAT IS -- TO THE CORE OF WHAT NURSES DO WHICH IS TAKE CARE OF PATIENTS. AND MAKE SURE THAT THE FAMILY MEMBERS THAT ARE THERE WITH THEIR WITH THE PATIENTS HAVE THE RESOURCES AND OPPORTUNITIES TO DISCUSS THE CASES. OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS SO THAT WE FEEL SECURE. THAT THEY ARE BEING TAKEN CARE OF AND I THINK THE HOSPITAL'S PLAYED A CRITICAL ROLE. IN MAKING SURE THAT THAT HAPPENED SO I'M I'M GLADLY SUPPORTING THIS BILL AND I HOPE THAT IT MOVES FORWARD AND YOU COME TO A RESOLUTION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MCCARTY. THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD -- I I SUPPORT THE BILL AYE AYE BUT IT FOR LAST YEAR THERE IS ONE WHEN ISSUE I KNOW THAT -- THE REPRESENTATIVES I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S BEEN ADDRESSED BY THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU TOOK. LAST YEAR. THERE WAS AN ELEMENT WITH THE PENALTIES CORRECT THEIR WEIGHT THERE WE TOOK OUT BEFORE IT WENT TO THE GOVERNOR. AND HE VETOED IT. AND IS THE VERSION THAT WE'RE PRESENTING TODAY EVEN WITH THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TO THAT STILL HAVE THAT PIECE IN THERE. IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T IT THIS IS IT WE'VE LOWERED SIGNIFICANTLY THE PENALTY AMOUNT THOSE PART OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE TOOK SO IT'S FIFTEEN THOUSAND AND THIRTY THOUSAND FOR A SECOND VIOLATION -- AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE NEW GOVERNOR WILL DO THAT'S PART OF THE REASON WE RE INTRODUCED IT. ARE YOU ARE YOU PROPOSING ARE WILLING TO TO GO TO THE THRESHOLD YOU HAD AT THE BILL THAT YOU SENT TO THE GOVERNOR LAST YEAR WERE AT THAT NOW. WE ARE YES OKAY. AND THAT'S WITH THE AMENDMENTS YOU TOOK TODAY THAT IS CORRECT OKAY. ALRIGHT THANK YOU YOU'RE WELCOME ANYONE ELSE. SEE NO ONE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE CENTER YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU FOR THE DISCUSSION I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT TWO THINGS THAT THE OPPOSITION RAISED. I DON'T KNOW IF THE SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR OUT OF RATIO DEFICIENCIES THAT I MENTIONED EQUAL THE 1% THAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT. BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS SIX HUNDRED AND THORPE THIRTY FOUR OUT OF RATIO DEFICIENCIES THAT'S A MINIMUM OF SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR PATIENTS SO SOMETIMES WE LOOK AT THINGS THAT WE THINK 1% 2% IT SEEMS VERY LOW. BUT TO ME THOSE ARE SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR LIVES AT A MINIMUM THAT WERE AFFECTED BY THOSE OUT OF RATIO -- DEFICIENCIES AND THEN THE SECOND IS TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER MCCARTY'S ABOUT THE THE VIOLATIONS YOU KNOW NGUYEN DOCTOR WOULDN'T I TALKED ABOUT -- REDUCING THE AMOUNT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I MENTIONED TO HIM WAS I WORRIED THAT FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WAS NOT ENOUGH AND THAT I WAS WORRIED THAT HOSPITALS WOULD SEE IT AS A COST OF DOING BUSINESS. SO WE FEEL LIKE WE ARE IN A POSITION WHERE THIS WILL BE SOME SORT OF A PENALTY THAT WILL THEY WILL WAKE UP AND NOT WORK A LITTLE HARDER. ON MAKING SURE THEY'RE NOT OUT OF RATIO SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE TOOK -- ANOTHER AMENDMENT THAT WE TOOK THAT I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT. IS AN EXEMPTION FOR WHEN NURSES ARE SIX UNEXPECTEDLY INJURED OR LATE IT NOW SAYS OF A HOSPITAL CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT THERE WERE PROBLEMS EFFORTS MADE. TO REPLACE THE NURSE AND MAINTAIN THE REQUIRED STAFFING LEVELS SUCH AS EXHAUSTING THEY'RE ON CALL LISTS AND UTILIZING THE CHARGE NEW NURSE THEN THE HOSPITAL WOULD NOT BE PENALIZED. SO I THINK THOSE ARE AMENDMENTS THAT I HOPE WILL GO A LONG WAY IN ALLEVIATING THE FEARS OF THE OPPOSITION AT THE END OF THE DAY WERE LOOKING TO TAKE CARE OF PATIENTS. FOR ALSO LOOKING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR NURSES AS MANY OF YOU HAVE HEARD ME SAY -- PEOPLE WHO BECOME NURSES DON'T DO IT NECESSARILY FOR THE MONEY THEY DO BECAUSE THEY TRULY CARE ABOUT PEOPLE AND THEY WILL SKIP BREAKS THEY WILL SKIP LUNCHES BECAUSE THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THEIR PATIENTS. SO WE HOPE THAT THIS BILL WILL MAKE THINGS BETTER FOR EVERYONE AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH US -- SENATOR MY PLEASURE THE BILL DOES ENJOY DO PASS RECOMMENDATION. AND LOOKING FOR A MOTION A MOTION BY MISS CARILLO THANK YOU. DURING THE SECOND THE SECOND BY MISTER MCCARTY. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS -- OUT OF SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL WHAT I WOULD AYE MAYES AGUIAR-CURRY. AGUIAR-CURRY AYE BIGELOW. BONTA. BURKE CARILLO. CARILLO AYE FLORA. LIMóN. MCCARTY. MCCARTY I'D NAZARIAN. SORRY SINCE I CAME IN LATE I JUST WANTED TO SAY AT LEAST I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT NOW BUT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING. HOW MUCH MORE WE CAN WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION BECAUSE OF THE TENUOUS MISS NATURE OF HOW SOMETIMES HOSPITALS CAN? BE PAYING FOR SOMETHING THAT -- THAT THAT THAT. HE IS OUTSIDE OF THEIR CONTROL SO. I FOR NOW AND I APOLOGIZE BUT THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY THAT THANK YOU. IS THERE AND I RAMOS. RAMOS NOT VOTING RODRIGUEZ SANTIAGO. WALDRON. YOU HAVE FIVE VOTES WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR OTHER WILL BE THE BILL ON CALL EXCUSE ME FOR FOR OTHER MEMBERS TO ADD ON SO. SO THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE HAVE THIS YEAR ANOTHER BILL. THE SECOND BEST BE [inaudible] FIVE SEVENTY FOUR PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I AM HAPPY TO BE HERE TO PRESENT YOU SB FIVE SEVENTY FOUR AND I DO WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE AGAIN FOR YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT BILL. FOR SEVERAL MONTHS -- WE'VE HAD GOOD FAITH NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE BILL'S SPONSORS AN OFFICE OPPOSITION AND WE HAVE REACHED A COMPROMISE. WHICH I HAVE TO SAY I'M VERY PROUD OF EVERYONE WHO'S BEEN WORKING ON THIS AS WE KNOW IN THIS -- BUILDING IT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY TO REACH A COMPROMISE SO I APPRECIATE THE SPIRIT IN WHICH A COMPROMISE WAS REACHED. AND HOW HARD EVERYONE HAS WORKED TO GET THERE. WITH THE SPORT THE SUPPORT THE CHAIR I AM OFFERING THE FOLLOWING AMENDMENTS TODAY. DELETE THE DEFINITION OF INTENTIONALLY ADDED INGREDIENT WITH NO ADDITIONAL CHANGES TO THE FRAGRANCE AND FLAVOR INGREDIENT DEFINITIONS. THIS THE MAIN AMENDMENT WILL ALIGN THE DEFINITION OF INGREDIENTS WITH EXISTING LAW AND REMOVE ANY CONCERNS OF OVER REACHING OR IMPRACTICAL. DISCLOSURE OF INGREDIENTS COMPONENTS. TO EXTEND THE IMPLEMENTATION DATE AND REPORTING FOR COMPLYING WITH THE BILL'S DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS TO JANUARY. ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE THIS AMENDMENT PROVIDES ADDITIONAL TIME TO REPAIR FOR IMPLEMENTATION COMPLAINTS AND PRODUCT REFORMULATION WITH. THANKS SIR WITH THESE AMENDMENTS THE IN THE LEAD INDUSTRY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MOVED TO NEUTRAL. TO DATE WE HAVE WORKED WITH INDUSTRY TO TAKE TWENTY SEVEN SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS PLUS TWO ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS WHICH I MENTIONED EARLIER. MEMBERS SB FIVE SEVENTY FOURS A BALANCED MEASURE THAT EMPOWERS CONSUMERS PROVIDES APPROPRIATE BUSINESS PROTECTION AND ADVANCES PUBLIC HEALTH SPECIFICALLY FIVE SEVENTY FOUR REQUIRES THE DISCLOSURE FRAGRANCE AND FLAVOR INGREDIENTS. AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS THAT APPEAR ON DESIGNATED AND AUTHORITY OF HAZARD CHEMICAL LIST TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THIS BILL VERY IMPORTANTLY DOES NOT BAN ANY PRODUCT IN GREEN NOR DOES IT REQUIRE ADDITIONAL PRODUCT LABELING I THINK THOSE ARE VERY IMPORTANT ASPECTS. SB FIVE SEVENTY FOUR PROTECTS TRADE SECRETS INCLUDING PRODUCT INGREDIENT FORMULAS SO THAT WE'RE PROTECTING VALUABLE RECIPES AND FORMULATIONS. MEMBERS TODAY IN CALIFORNIA THE PUBLIC KNOWS MORE ABOUT THE FRAGRANCE INGREDIENTS AND CLEANING PRODUCTS THAN THOSE WE USE TO CLEAN AND SENT OUR BODIES. PUT ANOTHER WAY WE ACTUALLY KNOW MORE ABOUT THE FRAGRANCES AND FLOOR CLEANERS AND DISTRICT THE DISINFECTANTS THEN OUR SHAMPOOS DEODORANTS AND BODY SPRAYS. WE ALSO KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE FLAVORS IN CHAPSTICK MOUTHWASH AND LIP CLASSES I BROUGHT MY LITTLE FAVORITE STRAWBERRY FIZZ LIP GLOSS I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW WHAT. MAKES IT STRAWBERRY FIELDS. CURRENTLY. CURRENTLY NO STATE OR FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES THE DISCLOSURE OF FRAGRANCE OR FLAVOR INGREDIENTS TO CONSUMERS A REGULATORY AGENCIES NOT EVEN THE FTA. THIS LOOPHOLE RICK RESULTS AND LITTLE REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OF THE SAFETY OF THOSE INGREDIENTS AND NO WAY TO IDENTIFY THE CHEMICALS THAT ARE BEHIND THE WORD FRAGRANCE OR FLAVOR ON THE LABEL OF BEAUTY AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS. THESE THE PRODUCTS YOU USE EVERY DAY IN THE MORNING AND IN THE EVENING THOUSANDS OF CHEMICALS ARE USED TO CREATE THE FRAGRANCES AND FLAVORS THAT COMPRISE THE BEAUTY. AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS SOME OF THESE CHEMICALS HAVE BEEN LEAD TO NEGATIVE HEALTH IMPACTS RANGING FROM ALLERGIC REACTIONS TO REPRODUCTIVE HARM AND INCREASED RISK OF BREAST CANCER. SB FIVE SEVENTY FOUR ONE POWER CONSUMERS TO MAKE EDUCATED DISS DECISIONS ABOUT WHICH PRODUCTS TO USE WITH THEMSELVES THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES. SB FIVE SEVENTY FOUR WILL ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO BE A NATIONAL AND GLOBAL LEADER ON PUBLIC HEALTH. THIS BILLS BROADLY SUPPORTED BY LABOR PUBLIC HEALTH ENVIRONMENTAL MULTI ETHNIC AND CANCER PREVENT PREVENTION ORGANIZATIONS. THIS MEASURE MEASURE IS ALSO SUPPORTED BY DOZENS OF BUSINESSES THAT ARE FINDING SUCCESS IN DISCLOSING FRAGRANCE AND FLAVOR INGREDIENTS INCLUDING UNILEVER THE SECOND LARGEST BEAUTY AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS. IN THE WORLD. HERE WITH ME IN SUPPORT. IS DOCTOR MEGAN SCHWARTZMAN A PHYSICIAN AN ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENTIST AT UC BERKELEY'S UP SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND AN ADDITIONAL SUPPORTER WHOSE NAME I DON'T HAVE A VERY SORRY [inaudible] PLEASE. MY NAME IS JANET MIDDLEMAN ON ONE OF THE BILL'S SPONSORS BREAST CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS AND I'M JUST HERE TO ANSWER TECHNICAL QUESTIONS AND DOCTOR SCHWARTZMAN IS GOING TO TAKE THE FULL FIVE TO SIX MINUTES. THAT'S OKAY. OKAY OR LESS IF YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD AND MEMBERS OF THE HEALTH COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS DOCTOR MEGAN TOWARDS MEN I AM A FAMILY PHYSICIAN AND AN ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENTIST IN UC BERKELEY SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH. I PRACTICE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE AND MY RESEARCH AND TEACHING FOCUSES ON THE HEALTH EFFECTS OF CHEMICAL EXPOSURES. I WORKED ON CALIFORNIA CHEMICALS POLICY FOR A DECADE I SERVE ON CALLIE PEES GREEN RIBBON SCIENCE PANEL AND I CHAIR THE BY MONITORING SCIENTIFIC ANNE'S PANEL SO. I'M HERE TODAY TO SUPPORT SB FIVE SEVENTY FOUR REQUIRING COMPANIES TO DISCLOSE THE PRESENCE OF HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS. IN THERE -- FRAGRANCE AND FLAVORING -- FORMULATIONS AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS. THIS IS NOT A SMALL CATEGORY OF CHEMICALS AS YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD FRAGRANCE AND FLAVOR CHEMICALS APPEAR IN THE GREAT MAJORITY OF PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS. AND OUT OF THE THREE THOUSAND FRAGRANCE CHEMICALS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED BY THE INTERNATIONAL FRAGRANCE ASSOCIATION IN. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN FULLY A THIRD OF THEM ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED OVER TWELVE HUNDRED CHEMICALS HAVE BEEN FLAGGED AS KNOWN OR POTENTIAL HAZARD -- CHEMICALS OF CONCERN BECAUSE THEY APPEAR ON ONE OR MORE SORTED OF LISTS OF HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS. THESE AUTHORITATIVE LISTS INCLUDE CHEMICALS LINKED TO CANCER BIRTH DEFECTS REPRODUCTIVE TOXICITY. ENDOCRINE DISRUPTION AND ALLERGIC SENSITIZATION. SOME OF THE HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS FOUND IN FRAGRANCE. FORMULATIONS INCLUDE PHTHALATES LINK TO REPRODUCTIVE TOXICITY THE VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUND ACETALDEHYDE WHICH IS A CARCINOGEN ON THE PROP SIXTY FIVE LIST. AND THE COMPOUND STYRENE WHICH HAS BOTH CARCINOGENIC AND ENDOCRINE DISRUPTING AFFECTS. YET AS WE'VE HEARD NO FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES THE DISCLOSURE OF THESE INGREDIENTS NOT TO CONSUMERS BUT ALSO NOT TO PRODUCT MANUFACTURERS OR THE FDA. THIS MEANS THAT WELL RECOGNIZED CHEMICAL HAZARDS CAN HIDE BEHIND THE TERM FRAGRANCE OR FLAVOR LISTED ON A PRODUCT LABEL. I BELIEVE THAT CONSUMERS AND WORKERS HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW. AND PHYSICIANS SCIENTISTS AND REGULATORS HAVE A NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE PRESENCE OF TOXIC CHEMICALS IN PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS. WHY ARE THESE EXPOSURES RELEVANT? MAYBE THERE'S ONLY A TINY AMOUNT OF THIS HAZARDOUS CHEMICAL IN A PRODUCT. THERE ARE THREE IMPORTANT POINTS ABOUT THIS THE FIRST IS THAT THE EXPOSURES AREN'T TINY MY OWN ANALYSIS OF THE MOST RECENT CARP CONSUMER CONSUMER PRODUCT SURVEY DATA. SHOWS THAT THE EMISSIONS OF VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS FROM FRAGRANCES IN PERSONAL PRODUCT CARE PRODUCTS ALONE TOTALED SIX TONS A DAY IN CALIFORNIA. THIS GIVES YOU A SENSE OF THE VOLUME OF THESE CHEMICALS IN COMMERCE. SECOND EXPOSURES TO EVEN VERY LOW DOSES OF HORMONALLY ACTIVE CHEMICALS TURNED OUT TO BE PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT FOR PREGNANT WOMEN INFANTS AND CHILDREN WHOSE DEVELOPING BODIES AND BRAINS ARE HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO SMALL FLUCTUATIONS IN HORMONAL SIGNALS. AND FINALLY WE'RE NOT EXPOSED TO THESE CHEMICALS IN ISOLATION WERE EXPOSED TO COMPLEX MIXTURES FROM A MULTIPLE PRODUCTS. WE NOW KNOW UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT EXPOSURE TO EVEN VERY LOW DOSES OF SOME CHEMICALS PARTICULARLY DURING DEVELOPMENT. MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF BREAST AND PROSTATE CANCERS. NEURO DEVELOPMENTAL AND NARROW DEGENERATIVE DISEASES LIKE ADHD AND PARKINSON'S. METABOLIC DISORDERS LIKE OBESITY AND DIABETES AND REPRODUCTIVE PROBLEMS SUCH AS INFERTILITY AND MALE GENITAL BIRTH DEFECTS. IN ADDITION TO THESE CHRONIC HEALTH EFFECTS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWO AND 11% OF THE GLOBAL POPULATION SUFFERS FROM FRAGRANCE ALLERGIES. WHICH MEANS THAT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE LACK THE INFORMATION TO AVOID THE SUBSTANCES THAT TRIGGER THEIR ALLERGIC REACTION. WHO IS EXPOSED GIVEN THE SIX TONS OF FRAGRANCE CHEMICALS EMITTED EVERY DAY FROM PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS IN CALIFORNIA WE ALL ARE? BUT THE HIGHEST USERS A FRAGRANCE PRODUCTS ARE WOMEN AND GIRLS PRECISELY THE POPULATION MOST AT RISK FOR HEALTH EFFECTS FROM THOSE CHEMICALS. ON AVERAGE US WOMEN USE TWELVE DIFFERENT PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS EVERY DAY. AND INDUSTRY MARKET RESEARCH INDICATES THAT NEARLY 40% OF GIRLS AGE SIX TO EIGHT USE PERFUME OR BODY SPRAY. FOR THE MORE THE WORK PLACES WITH SOME OF THE HIGHEST EXPOSURES TO FRAGRANCE TO PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS ARE DOMINATED BY WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE. NAIL AND HAIR SALON SPECIFICALLY WHERE WORKERS HAVE NEARLY FIVE FOLD ELEVATED RISK OF FRAGRANCE ALLERGIES COMPARED TO OTHER OCCUPATIONS FOR THOSE WORKERS. EXPOSURE TO PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS IS NOT ACTUALLY A PERSONAL CHOICE. FINALLY CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTED THAT NEARLY THREE HUNDRED CASES OF WORK RELATED ASTHMA ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE USE OF FRAGRANCE PRODUCTS IN THE WORKPLACE. THESE ARE COMPLETELY PREVENTABLE. FORTUNATELY AS WE'VE HEARD HUNDREDS OF COSMETIC COMPANIES ARE NOW VOLUNTARILY FULLY DISCLOSING THEIR FRAGRANCE INGREDIENTS INCLUDING INDUSTRY GIANTS LIKE UNILEVER AND PROCTER AND GAMBLE. RETAILERS ARE ALSO BECOMING PART OF THE SOLUTION TARGET WILL REQUIRE ITS NATIONAL BRANDS TO DISCLOSE FRAGRANCE INGREDIENTS BY. TWENTY TWENTY THIS SHOWS THAT IT'S POSSIBLE. BUT WE SHOULDN'T RELY ON VOLUNTARY ACTION ALONE TO SET PUBLIC POLICY WE NEED A REGULATORY FLOOR REQUIRING AT THE VERY LEAST DISCLOSURE OF KNOWN HAZARDOUS INGREDIENTS IN PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS FRAGRANCES AND FLAVORS. SB FIVE SEVENTY NINE FOUR IS NOT ABOUT AGAINST FRAGRANCE IT'S ABOUT THE RIGHT TO KNOW. EVEN CONSUMERS AND WORKERS THE INFORMATION THEY NEED. AS AN ADDED BENEFIT WE'VE LEARNED FROM OTHER RIGHT TO KNOW LAWS AT BOTH THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVEL THAT THE SIMPLE ACT OF HAVING TO DISCLOSE THE USE OF HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS.

WITH ADDITIONAL QUALIFICATIONS TO MEET THE CRITERIA OF THE FOR THE AUTISM PROFESSIONALS IMPAIR PROFESSIONALS. AND OUR OPPOSITION IS BASED ON THE FACT THAT WE THINK THIS WILL DILUTE HE QUALITY OF CARE CURRENTLY RECEIVED BY OUR ROWLEY'S -- GENERALLY SPEAKING HEALTH PLANS CONTRACT WITH LICENSED PROFESSIONALS TO ENSURE SERVICES PROVIDES TO THEIR ENROLLEES ARE ROOTED IN EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENT -- HEALTH PLAN COVERAGE DECISIONS ARE ROOTED ENOUGH EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENT TO STUDIES -- ONE WITH A SAMPLE SIZE OF TWENTY TWO YOU KNOW CUT THAT KIND OF HAVE OUTLINED IT SOME OF THOSE SERVICES OR THE MODALITIES THAT WOULD PROVIDE BE PROVIDED BY.

CENTER HER TAUGHT OF YOU HAVE A WAY TO ISSUE. YOU HAVE ITEM FOR SB TO SIXTY SB THREE THIRTY ONE IS ALREADY PASSED ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR SO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS -- TODAY I'M HERE TO PRESENT SB TWO SIXTY WHICH AIMS TO HELP EVERY DAY CALIFORNIANS AVOID COVERAGE% GAPS AND WHEN THEY UNDERGO LIFE CHANGES THAT TRIGGER LOSSES IN COVERAGE -- MANY OF THEM WILL UNDERGO LIFE EVENTS LIKE GETTING JOBS ARE EARNING MORE AT THEIR JOBS WHICH CAN CAUSE THEM TO LOSE MEDI CAL. AND BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR COVERED CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL ALLOWS COVERED CALIFORNIA TO EXPEDITE ENROLLMENT FOR PEOPLE LOSING MEDI CAL AND CHIP FUNDED PROGRAMS BY AUTO ASSIGNING. THEM TO THE PLAN WITH THE MOST ASSISTANCE WHILE STILL ALLOWING THEM TO SHOP AROUND. IT ALSO REQUIRES HEALTH PLANS AND INSURERS TO TRANSFER A LIST OF PEOPLE WHO LOSE COVERAGE FOR ANY REASON TO COVERED CALIFORNIA SO COVERED CALIFORNIA CAN REACH OUT TO GET THEM COVERED. WE'VE A SEPTIC TECHNICAL MOMENTS FROM THE STAKEHOLDERS AND HAVE DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION TO JULY TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO ALLOW COVERED CALIFORNIA TIME TO SET UP THE PROGRAM AND TO ENSURE WE ADDRESS. ANY OTHER OPERATIONAL QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS. THAT THE HEALTH PLANS MAY HAVE. THIS BILL HAS NO OPPOSITION AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE TODAY DON'T HAVE. THANK YOU. AND TODAY HAVE CHEN FLORI -- AND FROM THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AND MERRY JUNE DS WITH HEALTH ACCESS IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AND JDS HERE ON BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA PROUD TO CO SPONSOR SB TWO SIXTY WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. THIS BILL IS REALLY MEANT TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR CALIFORNIANS TO KEEP COVERAGE AND AVOID COVERAGE GAPS. EVERY DAY PEOPLE UNDERGO DIFFERENT TYPES OF LIFE EVENTS FOR EXAMPLE GETTING MARRIED GETTING DIVORCE HAVING A BABY TWENTY TWENTY SIX THAT COULD TRIGGER A LOSS OF HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. AND OUR BILL IS REALLY MEANT TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR THEM TO GET ACCESS TO COVERAGE WHETHER IT'S THROUGH MANY CAL OR COVERED CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL BUILDS ON EXISTING CALIFORNIA AT LAW THE ALREADY REQUIRES HEALTH PLANS AND INSURERS TO NOTIFY CONSUMERS OF THE AVAILABILITY OF COVERAGE AND MEDI CAL. OR COVERED CALIFORNIA REGARDLESS OF WHATEVER FOR WHATEVER REASON THEY LOST COVERAGE -- I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE CHEN FOR YOU WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT THE MEDI CAL TO COVER CALIFORNIA TRANSITION AND WE REQUEST YOUR I SUPPORT THANK YOU. CHEN FLORES THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY YEAH IN SOME OF THE EARLIEST IMPLEMENTATION. IMPLEMENTING LEGISLATION THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WE ENVISIONED A SYSTEM WHERE SOMEBODY. WHERE WOULD HAVE NO WHAT'S WRONG DOOR BASICALLY SOMEONE WOULD APPLY FOR ONE PROGRAM AND IF THEY WERE FOUND IN ELIGIBLE FOR THAT PROGRAM WE DO USE ALL THEIR INFORMATION TO SEE IF THEY WERE ELIGIBLE FOR ANY OF? ANY OTHER PROGRAM. MOST OF THIS IS WORKING WHEN SOMEONE'S INCOME GOES UP SUCH THAT THEY'RE NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL OR ANOTHER PROGRAM LIKE AN CAP OR SEE CHIP. THE COUNTY ELIGIBILITY WORKERS DO INDEED DETERMINE IF THE PERSON'S ELIGIBLE FOR COVER CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THEY ALREADY HAVE THE NECESSARY INFORMATION. THEY THEN PUT THAT PERSON INTO THE ELIGIBILITY SYSTEM IN THE COVER CALIFORNIA PROGRAM WE KNOW WHAT THEIR INCOME IS WE KNOW HOW MUCH FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE ARE ELIGIBLE. FOR HOWEVER BECAUSE OF HOW THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS INVOLVING PLAN SELECTION OVERLAY WITH OUR STATE LAW REGARDING TIMELY NOTICE WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE PEOPLEMOVE LOSING THEIR MEDI CAL OR OTHER PROGRAM OFTEN HAVE LESS THAN TEN DAYS INCLUDING WEEKENDS AND HOLIDAYS TO SELECT A PLAN. OR THEY FACE A GAP IN COVERAGE. PLAN SELECTION MAY NOT SEEM LIKE AN INSURMOUNTABLE BARRIER BUT PEOPLE OFTEN DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GET HELP OR UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY MUST DO TO EFFECTUATE COVERAGE. THE NETWORKS BETWEEN MEDI CAL AND CAPS EACH SHIP AND COVER CALIFORNIA DON'T ALWAYS MATCH. SADLY WE'VE ALSO SEEN A NUMBER OF CONSUMERS WHO ENDED UP IN THE ER DURING THAT GOT PERIOD AND INCURRED MEDICAL BILLS THEY COULDN'T PAY AND SOME OF THEM HAD ALREADY IN FACT AND ROLE AND COVERED CALIFORNIA. BUT THEIR COVERAGE WOULDN'T BE EFFECTIVE UNTIL THE NEXT MONTH. SB TO SIXTY IS A TECHNICAL FIX IT THREADS THE NEEDLE BETWEEN STATE AND FEDERAL LAW BY HAVING COVER CALIFORNIA START THE ENROLLMENT PROCESS TO AVOID THE GAP IN COVERAGE WHILE STILL ALLOWING CONSUMERS TO CHANGE PLANS OR FORGO COVERAGE IF THEY DON'T WANT IT. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE THANK YOU. VERY MUCH OTHERS IN SUPPORT. HELLO HOW TO CONTACT US ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS CALIFORNIA CHAPTER IN SUPPORT.

YOUR MIND SIR. THE MOTION IN THE SECOND. I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN TWENTY THIRTEEN I AUTHORED AB THREE SIX ONE WHICH AUTHORIZES THE CREATION OF HEALTH HOMES PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA. THAT WAS SHORTLY AFTER THE RECESSION IN THE BILL WAS ALLOWED -- TO THE BILL WILL NOT WAS ALLOWED TO SUNSET AFTER TWO YEARS AS YOU KNOW HEALTH PLANS PROVIDERS READ THIS IS A PILOT PROGRAM BACK IN THE TWO YEARS AND ARE LESS LIKELY TO TO FULLY IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM. NOW THAT OUR ECONOMY IS IN A MUCH BETTER POSITION SB THREE SIX ONE WHICH IS BEFORE YOU TODAY WILL ENSURE THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE HEALTH HOMES PROGRAM IS CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT. OF THE ORIGINAL LAW. YOU KNOW IF MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THE GOAL OF THE HEALTH HOMES PROGRAM IS TO HELP MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES WHO ARE HOMELESS. AND OR LIVE WITH MULTIPLE CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS -- WITH THEIR ADHERENCE TO MEDICATION LINK THEM TO PEER FAMILY SUPPORT SYSTEMS AND PROVIDE HOUSING TRANSITION SERVICES AMONG OTHER SERVICES -- I KNOW THAT THERE BEEN SOME CONCERNS FROM HEALTH PLANS ABOUT THE TIERED RATES AT THAT. THE REQUIRED TO PAY -- HEALTH HOME PROVIDERS AND WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE PLANS AND HAVE YET TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT. ON THAT WILL ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS THAT WOULD PRESERVE OUR GOAL TO INCREASE PARTICIPATION AMONG MEMBERS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS HOWEVER WE ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THEM. AND THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT ON THE LANGUAGE IN THE REQUIREMENT FOR TIERED PAYMENT RATES. I WILL POINT OUT TO FOR YOU TO HEAR FROM THE CHIU EXPERTS AS WE WORK SO HARD THAT THE ALL THOSE YEARS AGO -- AND YOU'LL HEAR FROM SHARING REPORT AND LINDEN WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER AND THE CORPORATION FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING RESPECTIVELY. AND I'LL BE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS BUT ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH PLEASE GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS LED AWAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY PROUD CO SPONSORS OF THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE WE FIRSTLY IT WOULD LIKE TO APPRECIATE THAN ASSEMBLY MEMBER. MITCHELL'S LEADERSHIP AND AUTHORIZING THE STATE TO CREATE THE HEALTH HOMES PROGRAM AND THE BIT AND THIS BILL TO ENSURE THE PROGRAM IS OPERATING AS INTENDED. FIRSTLY WOULD LIKE TO START WITH LESSONS LEARNED FROM OTHER STATES THAT CAN HELP CALIFORNIA IMPROVE THE PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY MAIN EVALUATORS REPORTED A PERCEPTION THAT THE PROGRAM IS NOT SUSTAINABLE OR PREDICTABLE BECAUSE OF A POTENTIAL TO YEAR. END DATE -- WHICH DISCOURAGES PLANS AND PROVIDERS FROM HIRING STAFF CALIFORNIA'S EXPERIENCES THAT'S FAR BEEN CONSISTENT WITH MAINS. A FURTHER I THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STATES ON THAT -- INSUFFICIENT DATA AFTER TWO YEARS TO ASSESS OUTCOMES DUE TO DATA LACKS AND SO IT DOES TAKE SOME TIME TO SHOW THAT THIS PROGRAM IS WORKING. AND EVALUATORS AT NEW YORK'S HEALTH HOME PROGRAM RECOMMENDED TIERED RATES WITH HIGHER RATES FOR PEOPLE SIR -- FOR A PROVIDER SERVING INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS A TIERED RATE STRUCTURE ALLOWS PROVIDERS TO GET PAID FOR THE TYPE AND INTENSITY OF SERVICES PROVIDED. CALIFORNIA'S HOMELESS THIS CRISIS IS GROWING WHILE DECLINING BETWEEN TWENTY TEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN CALIFORNIA SAUL AND 9% OVERALL INCREASE IN HOMELESSNESS WHILE THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE SAW A 13% DECLINE. UNTIL CALIFORNIA'S ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT THE BILL WOULD IMPROVE CARE TO MEDI CAL ENROLLEES WHO ARE HOMELESS AND HAVE A CHRONIC CONDITION OR A SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS WE ARE DRIVE VOTE. ON THIS MEASURE THAT HAS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND NO NO VOTE. GOOD AFTERNOON SHARON REPORT WITH THE CORPORATION FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING -- BENEFICIARIES EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND KERR DISPROPORTIONATE MEDI CAL COSTS WE KNOW THIS FROM DECADES OF RESEARCH THAT THEIR COSTS ACTUALLY INCREASE OVER TIME WHILE THERE HOMELESS EVEN IF THEY'RE RECEIVING THE BEST CARE COORDINATION SERVICES. DECADES OF DATA ALSO SHOW THAT WHEN YOU CONNECT THESE BENEFICIARIES TO INTENSIVE SERVICES TO HELP THEM GET STABLY HOUSE. AND TO AT AND ACHIEVE HELL STABILITY THAT BENEFICIARIES ARE ABLE TO NOT ONLY IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH OUTCOMES DRAMATICALLY THEY SAVE SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC RESOURCES. THANKS TO SENATOR MITCHELL'S A. B. THREE SIXTY ONE THE HEALTH HOMES PROGRAM IS FUNDING SERVICES TO HELP PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. GET CONNECTED -- TO HOUSING NAVIGATION SERVICES AND TENANCY STABILITY SERVICES. WELL THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES REQUIRES HEALTH HOME PROGRAM PROVIDERS TO OFFER THESE SERVICES. THE STATE HAS SOME DISTANCE TO GO BEFORE THE PROGRAM FOR FILLS THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF AB. THREE SIXTY ONE IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SERVE MANY MANY MORE CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. AND TO HAVE GREATER IMPACT ON THIS POPULATION. SB THREE SIXTY ONE THAT WILL ENSURE HEALTH PLANS CAN DETERMINE WHICH MEMBERS ARE EXPERIENCING CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS AT THE MOMENT THEY HAVE NO WAY OF IDENTIFYING MEMBERS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. BUT LONG CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS SO THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE -- PROVIDERS TO OUR REACH TO PEOPLE ON THE STREETS AND PROVIDE INCENTIVES TO HEALTH HOME -- PROVIDERS TO SERVE THE POPULATION CURRENTLY PROVIDERS. WHO ARE PROVIDING HEALTH HOME SERVICES? NOW THAT PROVIDING SERVICES TO THIS POPULATION IS MORE DIFFICULT AND MORE EXPENSIVE FOR THEM AND SO THEY HAVE FEW INCENTIVES TO TACKLE THE NEEDS OF THIS -- THESE BENEFICIARIES. THOUGH PROVIDERS DO NOT HAVE ANY CURRENT INCENTIVES TO SERVE PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS THE PLANS AND THE STATE DO -- I HAD ONE EXAMPLE IS A JOURNAL OF AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION STUDY THAT SHOWED. THAT -- A HOMELESS BENEFICIARIES RECEIVING THESE TYPES OF SERVICES SAVED TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER MONTH BY PROVIDING INTENSIVE SERVICES THAT CONNECT PEOPLE TO HOUSING. OVER THEIR PREVIOUS COSTS -- TO MEDICAID. IN A REPORT TO CONGRESS THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES EVALUATORS REPORTED HOUSING INSTABILITY AS AMONG THE GREATEST REPORTED NEED. AND THE LACK OF CONNECTION TO HOUSING IS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE TO PROGRAM'S SUCCESS. PARTICULARLY CONSIDERING HOW MANY OF THE HIGHEST COST MEDICAID BENEFICIARIES EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS. SB THREE SIXTY ONE REMOVE BARRIERS TO SUSTAINING THE HEALTH HOMES PROGRAM. AND EMPLOYMENT TO HOLD HOMES PROGRAM THAT ADDRESSES THE NEED FOR SERVICES AMONG MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT.

THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF OBSTETRICIANS AND GYNECOLOGISTS IN THEIR TWENTY SEVENTEEN REPORT ENTITLED POLICY ON RACIAL BIAS NOTES QUOTE. THE RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN WOMEN'S HEALTH CANNOT BE REVERSED WITHOUT ADDRESSING RACIAL BIAS BOTH IMPLICIT AND EXPLICIT. WITHOUT EXAMINING THESE DISPARITIES THROUGH A LENS THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT RACE GENDER AND CLASS AND EQUITABLE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT SERVES ALL WOMEN CANNOT BE REALIZED IN QUOTE. SB FOUR SIX FOUR CALLS FOR THIS THOROUGH AN INTERSECTIONAL EXAMINATION OF BIAS. THE BILL REQUIRES EVERY HOSPITAL AND ALTERNATIVE BURST CENTER TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE BASED IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING TO ALL PERINATAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. THESE TRAININGS WILL CALL ATTENTION TO THE INTERPERSONAL INSTITUTIONAL AND STRUCTURAL BARRIERS TO EQUITABLE CARE IN ORDER TO CATALYZE A CULTURAL CHANGE IN HOSPITALS. SO THAT ALL WOMEN ARE ASSURED A DIGNIFIED. EXPERIENCE DURING CHILDBIRTH. ALTHOUGH OPPOSITION REPORTS THAT FACILITY BASED TRAININGS ARE NOT THE APPROPRIATE VEHICLE TO DELIVER THESE TRAININGS TO PHYSICIANS RESEARCH SHOWS THAT IMPLICIT BIAS TRAININGS WORK. AND DO AND DO SO BEST WHEN THEY ARE DONE IN PERSON. IN A GROUP SETTING AND OUR INTERACTIVE. SENATE BILL FOUR SIX FOUR ENCOURAGES IN PLACE TRAINING WITH ALL PERINATAL STAFF TO MAXIMIZE THE POTENTIAL OF THE FACILITIES WIDE IMPACT. SB FOUR SIX FOUR WILL ALSO REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO TRACK AND PUBLISH MATERNAL MORTALITY AND SEVERE MORBIDITY RATES TO BETTER MONITOR THESE ISSUES.

I DID A FULL AUDIT A ONE OF THE HOSPITALS IN BERKELEY. OOPS I GUESS I GAVE IT AWAY FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT MIGHT KNOW THE AREA -- I DID A FULL AUDIT TO MY STAFF DID A FULL ON IT WHEN I WAS A DIRECTOR MATERNAL CHILD HEALTH FOR THE CITY OF BERKLEY. OF ALL THEIR RECORDS FOR ONE YEAR PERIOD OF TIME ALL THEIR DELIVERY RECORDS TO SEE WHAT THERE WERE MANY. WE DON'T NEED TO GO INTO THAT WE KNOW THAT WE CAN TELL THAT THERE ARE BIASES BASED ON INFANT MORTALITY THAT IS FOUR TIMES HIGHER -- THREE TWO TIMES HIGHER AND MATERNAL MORTALITY AS FOUR TIMES HIGHER IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY. WE CAN NO LONGER JUST SIT BACK BUT YOU KNOW I SAID THAT THIRTY YEARS AGO. AND MICKEY LELAND'S HEARING IN IN IN [inaudible] WASHINGTON -- BUT WE NEED MORE INFORMATION ON OUR BIRTH CERTIFICATES THAT WEEKEND THEN AUTOMATICALLY NOW IN OUR ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS. SHARE WITH THE PHYSICIANS TO DELIVERED. THE BABIES THEY DON'T HAVE TO SHARE THE NAMES BUT THEY SHOULD KNOW OF ALL THEIR DELIVERIES HOW MANY OF THESE BABIES ACTUALLY DIED IN CONGREGATE. HOW MANY OF THE MOTHERS HAD PROBLEMS POST PARTUM AND PASSED AWAY POSTPARTUM? WE DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT AS OF THIS POINT THE PHYSICIAN RECORDS ARE NOT ACCURATE ENOUGH THEY NEED TO HAVE A CASE. THERE HAS TO COME FROM THE BIRTH RECORD. AND THE PHYSICIANS OFTENTIMES DO NOT HAVE THAT. SECONDLY I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE AN ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM. FOR THE DOCKS AND THIS WOULD BE ONE OF THE ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEMS THERE'S RIGHT NOW THEY'RE NOT ACCOUNTABLE TO ANYBODY IN REALITY. THEY'RE NOT ACCOUNTABLE TO ANYBODY. EVEN TO SOME OF THE COMMITTEES IN THE HOSPITALS THEY DON'T HAVE TO ACTUALLY REPORT ON ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE MAY HAVE RISEN AND WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO IMPROVE. ON THOSE ISSUES. NEEDLESS TO SAY. THINGS AROUND IMPLICIT BIAS. WHICH IS IN THE OLD DAYS YOU JUST CALLED STRAIGHT UP RACISM. BASED ON THE COLOR OF A PERSON'S SKIN AND BY THE WAY WHEN A WOMAN COMES IN IS AND THE THE NURSES TO THE DOCK WE GOT A TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLD BLACK WOMAN. ALREADY THAT BIASES THERE HASN'T EVEN SEEN THE PATIENT. THAT IS REALLY A PROBLEM. SO WE REALLY NEED TO BE ABLE TO NOT ONLY TRAIN PEOPLE AROUND IMPLICIT BIAS BUT ALSO BE ABLE TO HAVE THEM. LEARN FROM IT AND TO SEE THEIR OWN BEHAVIOR AND HOW THEIR BEHAVIOR -- IN THE DELIVERY WOULD WORK. I STRONGLY SUPPORT SENATE BILL FOUR SIXTY FOUR IS SOMETHING IS REALLY GOT TO BE DONE -- AND WE NEED TO GET RID OF THIS ON GOING IN EQUITY BETWEEN RACES IN THIS COUNTRY.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE. SAY NO ONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS CAM IN. THREE NINE WE DO HAVE A MOTION BY MISTER MAYES A SECOND BY MISS CARILLO CENTER WHICH WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I WOULD VERY MUCH THANK YOU -- AS A T. SHIRT SAY THAT FEEL GREEN TEA FOR SINCE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO TRAVEL -- UP HERE TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT AND TELL THEIR STORIES BLACK WOMEN DO DESERVE BETTER. AND WHEN WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE BLACK MATERNAL MORTALITY RATE IN CALIFORNIA REMAINS FOUR TIMES HIGHER THAN THOSE OF OTHER RACIAL RACIAL ETHNIC GROUPS. THAT'S WHY THE BILL IS BEFORE YOU TODAY -- I HAVE TO SAY MISTER CHAIR YOU KNOW I STAFF SENATE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE. ALMOST THIRTY YEARS AGO. WHEN WE DIDN'T HAVE A MOVEMENT BY AND FOR BLACK WOMEN TO ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF THEIR OWN LIVES AND THEMSELVES? THIS WOULD GIVE ME GREAT PRIDE TO STAND HERE TODAY TO SEE A HEARING ROOM FILLED WITH WOMEN. WHO ARE CLEAR THAT THEY DO DESERVE BETTER AND ARE WILLING TO STEP UP AND ENGAGE IN ADVOCACY TO MAKE SURE THAT -- BIAS BE IT IMPLICIT OR EXPLICIT -- WILL NO LONGER IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO DELIVER A FULL TERM BABY. OR TO SURVIVE CHILDBIRTH THEMSELVES. THE GOAL OF THIS BEFORE SIX FOR IS TO DO THAT. WITH THIS BILL IN THE MOVEMENT THAT IT IS HELPING TO CREATE -- WHETHER -- A DOCTOR VOLUNTARILY CHOOSES TO TAKE THE IMPLICIT IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING OR NOT. IT IS OUR HOPE THAT WOMEN WILL ASK THEIR PROVIDERS. AS WE INTERVIEW DOCTORS AS WE ALL ARE TAUGHT WHEN WE GO TO THE TWO OR OF THE BIRTHING CENTER IN THE OLD BE SO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU GOING TO DELIVER THE BABY WE'RE GETTING COURAGE BLACK WOMAN TO ASK THEIR PROVIDER. HAVE YOU GONE TO IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING I WANT TO INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF MY SURVIVAL. OF DELIVERING THIS BABY. SO WITH ALL THAT I HOPE THAT YOU WILL JOIN US IN THIS MOVEMENT AND SUPPORT SENATE BILL FOUR SIX FOUR I THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE. I THINK YOU CENTER MITCHELL AND I REALLY WANT TO THANK YOUR WITNESSES -- FOR SHARING WITH US TODAY AND ALL THE PEOPLE CAME HERE TODAY FROM GREAT DISTANCES TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL -- THE SCIENCE DOESN'T LIE AND IT'S SAD THAT WE ARE IN THE STATE THAT -- IN FOR WE'RE COUNTY IN THE AND THE RISK OF MOTHERS IS MUCH HIGHER FOR WOMEN OF COLOR -- I AM PLEASED TO SEE THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. AND I WOULD HOPE THAT THEY WOULD REQUIRE OF THE DOCTORS -- WHO DELIVER IN THEIR HOSPITALS TO UNDERGO THIS TRAINING AS A CONDITION OF WORKING -- AND DELIVERING AND THEIR HOSPITALS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT -- AND I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR YOUR BRINGING THIS TO OUR ATTENTION IT'S IMPORTANT THAT EVERYBODY HAVE THE CHANCE TO HAVE A LIGHT HEALTHY BABY. HAD A HEALTHY OUTCOME FOR THE MOTHER AS WELL WITH THAT -- I WILL ASK MADAM SECRETARY -- TO CALL THE ROLL OF THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS MA'AM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

RODRIGUEZ AYE SANTIAGO WALDRON HI [inaudible] SEVEN ALSO. THE BILL HAS SEVEN WE STILL HAVE -- MEMBERS WHO ARE HERE BELIEVE THE BILL ON CALL THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE DOCTOR PAN. GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON DOCTOR PAN. GIVE IT JUST A SECOND SIR. GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF TIME THIS CAN BE A SPENT WITH ME A READY I NEVER WANT TO KEEP YOU WAITING APPRECIATE THAT [inaudible] OKAY. YOU HAVE TO BILLS BEFORE US THE FIRST ONE WILL BE -- ITEM NUMBER EIGHT SB THREE FORTY THREE THAT'S OKAY. THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU DOCTOR CHAIR MEMBERS -- SB THREE FORTY THREE REMOVES PROVISIONS IN THE LAW THAT ALLOWS KAISER PERMANENT TATE REPORTS. LESS INFORMATION TO REGULATORS THEN OTHER HEALTH PLANS AND HOSPITALS. TRANSPARENCY LAWS LIKE RATE REVIEW IN HOSPITAL FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES WERE CREATED TO HELP PURCHASERS AND REGULATORS MINOR COSTS THAT DRIVE HEALTH. INSURANCE PREMIUM RATES AS HEALTHCARE COSTS CONTINUE TO RISE POLICYMAKERS PURCHASERS AND CONSUMERS SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT IS DRIVING COST INCREASES AT KAISER. THEY HAVE ABOUT EVERY OTHER HOSPITAL AND HEALTH PLAN. I RECENTLY AGREED TO AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS SOME OF KAISER'S CONCERNS -- DUE TO KAISER SO UNIQUE STRUCTURE THEY STATED THAT THEY WERE UNABLE TO REPORT BALANCE SHEETS ARE CASH FLOW STATEMENTS BY EACH INDIVIDUAL FACILITY. WE AGREED TO REINSTATE THE KAISER LANGUAGE FOR THOSE PORTIONS OF THE HOSPITAL ANNUAL REPORTS. ADDITIONALLY BECAUSE OZ PART WILL BE HALF TO DEVELOP REGULATIONS TO CHANGE THE WAY KAISER COMPLETES ANNUAL REPORTS WE AGREE TO THE LAY CHANGES THE KAISER AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND TO OUR SPOT COMPLETES THE REGULATIONS. THE MYTH OF THIS ISN'T EVERYTHING KAISER ASKED FOR BUT WE ARE AT LEAST. AT A POINT WHERE WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR ANYTHING THE KAISER'S UNABLE TO COMPLY WITH. NOW GIVEN HOW MANY HOSPITALS KAISER OPERATES AND HOW MANY PATIENTS ARE COVERED BY CRISIS HEALTH PLANS THIS BILL REPRESENTS A HUGE LEAP FORWARD IN TRANSPARENCY OF HEALTH CARE COSTS. I DO WANT TO RECOGNIZE AND I THINK HIGHS ARE FOR WORKING WITH ME AND THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL. I KNOW WE'RE NOT QUITE THERE YET BUT I WOULD POINT OUT AND A LITTLE I GUESS I SHOULD THE THAT I THINK THAT WERE WE WERE WE WERE WE ARE ASKED I THINK IT'S SOMEPLACE THAT'S IN MY MIND IS -- REASONABLE WE TRY TO BRING THINGS TOGETHER AND WITH THAT ASPECT WE ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE MY MY WITNESSES AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU PLEASE GO AHEAD GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHARITY OR ON BEHALF OF THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION ON BEHALF OF SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS WE ARE THE PROUDSPONSORS OF SB. THREE FORTY THREE AGAIN A BILL TO ENSURE THAT OUR HOSPITALS AND HAVE HEALTH PLANS ON A LIVING PLATE LEVEL PLAYING FIELD WHEN IT COMES TO TRANSPARENCY ABOUT HEALTH CARE COST. I THINK ALL OF US ARE AWARE ABOUT THE INCREASING COST OF HEALTHCARE ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ON BEHALF OF SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS WHO HAVE EMPLOYER COVERAGE IN HEALTHCARE THEIR COST CONTINUE TO RISE ON A DAY TO DAY AND I THINK YOUR CONSTITUENTS I'M SURE YOU HEAR IT ON A DAY TO DAY WE HEAR IT FROM MEMBERS OF SCA YOU. MEMBERS OUTSIDE OF S. YEAH YOU THE HUGE RATE OF GROWTH IN HEALTHCARE COSTS AND THE ONLY WAY THAT WE CAN TACKLE THIS PROBLEM IS HAVING INFORMATION I THINK WE OFTEN HEAR THE TERM INFORMATION IS POWER IN ORDER FOR US. TO BE ABLE TO TACKLE THE PROBLEM OF HEALTH CARE COSTS WE HAVE TO ENSURE EVERYONE'S ON A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD AND THE DATA THAT WE GET FROM OTHER HOSPITAL SYSTEMS. IS CONSISTENT WITH THE DATA THAT WE GET FROM A KAISER WHO SERVES OVER 60% OF THE POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF WHAT OUR MEMBERS ARE EXPERIENCING -- HEALTHCARE COSTS HAVE GONE UP SO HIGH IN THE YEAR OF NINETEEN NINETY NINE EMPLOYER SPONSORED COVERAGE WAS AT ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY ONE DOLLARS. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN HEALTHCARE COSTS HAVE GONE UP TO OVER EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS SO I DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO ALL OF YOU HERE ON THE DíAS THE PROBLEM THEY WERE ATTEMPTING TO TACKLE IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE COMMITTED TO HAVING A RICH CONVERSATION. WITH THE ALLIES IN FOLKS ACROSS THE AISLE ABOUT HOW TO TACKLE THAT BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT KAISER HAS TO BE ON THE SAME LEVEL PLAYING FIELD AS EVERY OTHER HOSPITAL IN ASSOCIATION IN CALIFORNIA. AND MAKE SURE THAT THOSE PRICES AND THEIR RATES ARE TRANSPARENT SO WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM TACKLE THE PROBLEM AND DO SOMETHING TO ADDRESS THE COST FOR CONSTITUENTS IN THE FOLKS THAT WE CARE ABOUT ACROSS THE STATE [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS YES MEAN PALETTE FOR HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA THE STATE WIDE HEALTH CARE CONSUMER ADVOCACY COALITION HERE IN SUPPORT OF SB. THREE FORTY THREE MEMBERS HELP ACCESS WAS THE SPONSOR OF THE ORIGINAL RATE REVIEW LEGISLATION WHICH SB THREE FORTY THREE A MAN'S WE DRAFTED THE SENTENCE WHICH ALLOWS KAISER DOCTORS TO DISCLOSE ACTUAL EXPERIENCE USING BENEFIT CATEGORIES THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE USED BY OTHER PLANS. THE RATE REVIEW LAW REQUIRES HEALTH PLANS TO SAY HOW MUCH THEY SPENT ON TEN CATEGORIES PHYSICIAN SERVICES INPATIENT HOSPITAL CARE OUTPATIENT EMERGENCY CARE LABS AND IMAGING. MEMBERS DUES DOES KAISER KNOW HOW MUCH PHYSICIAN SERVICES COST SEPARATED OUT FROM HOSPITAL SERVICES DO THEY HAVE A BUDGET THAT SEPARATES LAB SERVICES FROM X. RAYS AND CAT SCANS MRI AND OTHER IMAGING COSTS. HOW ARE THEY PROVIDING CARE TO ALMOST NINE MILLION CALIFORNIANS IF THEY DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THEY SPEND ON DOCTORS COMPARED TO HOSPITALS? WE KNOW FROM OUR WORK ON OTHER RATE REVIEW BILLS THAT KAISER PROVIDES TO LARGE PURCHASERS MUCH MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ON UNIT COSTS AND UTILIZATION FOR TYPES OF CARE. AND THEY DO IT QUARTERLY YET ON THE RATE FILINGS KAISER SAYS THEY CANNOT PUBLICLY EXPLAIN WHAT THEY SPEND ON DOCTORS HOSPITALS LABORATORIES AND IMAGING. FOR THESE REASONS WE SUPPORT SB THREE FORTY THREE AND REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN SUPPORT JUST YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION PLEASE.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THERESA START WITH KAISER PERMANENTE A WE DO HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION. ON THE BILL AND WE DO WANT TO EXPRESS OUR THANKS AND APPRECIATION TO THE AUTHOR AND SPONSOR -- FOR WHAT I BELIEVE HAVE BEEN HOURS AND HOURS OF CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS BILL -- AND OUR CONCERNS WITH IT IN AND WE REALLY DO APPRECIATE THAT THEY HAVE LISTEN TO US AND AS YOU HEARD FROM SENATOR PAN -- THEY DID MAKE A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENT TO THE BILL -- I LAST WEEK WHICH WHICH WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE AND DOES GO -- QUITE A WAYS IN ADDRESSING OUR CONCERNS SO WE ACTUALLY ARE REALLY REALLY CLOSE IN BEING ABLE TO RESOLVE THIS BILL AND AND COME TO A COMPROMISE A LOT OF THAT GOING ON IN THE COMMITTEE TODAY -- THEY THE ONLY AMENDMENT THAT WE ARE STILL REQUESTING IT IS SIMILAR TO WHAT ALREADY WHEN IN THE BILL ON THE NEW REQUIREMENTS THAT WE HAVE AGREED TO REPORT. AT A MORE GRANULAR LEVEL ON THE ANNUAL -- HOSPITAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS TO OSHKOSH WE ARE SIMPLY LOOKING FOR THE SAME DELAY -- INTO LAS POD CAN DO REGULATIONS -- AND GET READY FOR THIS NEW DATA ON THE QUARTERLY REPORTING SIDE SO KAISER HAS AGREED -- TO ALL OF THE NEW DATA ELEMENTS AT THE FACILITY LEVEL AT AT THE QUARTERLY REPORTING BUT WE SIMPLY WOULD ASK FOR A DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION TO ALLOW. A KAISER PERMANENTE TO RAMP UP FOR THAT AND TO GET READY FOR THAT NEW REQUIREMENT AS WELL AS TO ALLOW OFSHE TIED TO RAMP UP AND GET READY FOR THAT SO -- WE HAVE AGREED TO ALMOST EVERYTHING IN THIS BILL WE WE ACTUALLY HAVE MET THE AUTHOR. A HALF WHERE MORE THAN HALF WAY ACTUALLY ON IN AND AGAIN DO APPRECIATE -- ALL OF THAT THE CONVERSATIONS SENATOR PAN COMMITTED EARLY ON I IN IN THE SENATE TO WORK WITH US IN IN TO ENTERTAIN REASONABLE AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS WHICH WE DO APPRECIATE. I THINK THIS IS THE EPITOME OF A REASONABLE MAN AND AND JUST TO ADDRESS THAT THE SPONSORS -- HEALTHCARE COSTS ARE ARE CONCERNED AS WELL -- WE ABSOLUTELY SURE THAT CONCERN WHICH IS ACTUALLY WHY THIS AMENDMENT IS SO IMPORTANT IS IT. WILL ALLOW US -- TO HAVE ADMINISTRATIVELY MORE SIMPLIFIED WAY OF REPORTING THIS DATA IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS IF WE WAIT EIGHTEEN MONTHS -- OFSHE BUT WILL HAVE UPGRADED THEIR TECHNOLOGY SO I WON'T HAVE TO HIRE ADDITIONAL PEOPLE TO DO THIS THOUSANDS OF FIELD OF MANUAL DATA ENTRY WHICH IS HOW WE WOULD HAVE TO DO IT NOW -- WE THINK IT MAKES MORE SENSE -- AND IS MORE COST EFFECTIVE TO JUST ALLOW OURSELVES TO BUILD UP TO THAT SYSTEM ALLOW OCCUPIED TO BUILD UP TO THAT AND TO CONTINUE -- TO BE GOOD STEWARDS OF OUR MEMBER DOLLARS SO -- UNFORTUNATELY WITHOUT THAT A MINUTE WE WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO OPPOSE THE BILL BUT AGAIN -- EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION TO THE AUTHOR IN PARTICULAR HIS STAFF WHO'S BEEN VERY PATIENT WITH ME ANYONE ELSE. TO KNOWN BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS MR. FOR DR PANDERING TO SEE YOU AND THE FIRST TIME I HEARD THIS BILL IT HAS COME A LONG WAY SO I MEAN DESERVE A TIME A CREDIT FOR WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE REMARKABLE HOW WELL THIS IS COME TOGETHER. BUT I DO HAVE JUST THAT ONE QUESTION IN YOUR OPINION WHAT IS THE CONCERN. WITH THE LANE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE QUARTERLY FILINGS. SO -- I THINK THE CHALLENGES IS THAT -- WHAT WE THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL IS TO HAVE KAISER REPORT -- RECOGNIZING THE KAISER IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT -- TO HAVE THAT ESSENTIALLY REPORT THAT SAME OR SIMILAR DATA -- WITHIN REASON AS ALL OTHER HOSPITALS AND HEALTH PLANS RIGHT AND SO. THE CHALLENGE ON THE QUARTERLY REPORT RIGHT NOW SO I CERTAINLY -- YOU KNOW KAISER SAID CAN WE WAIT EIGHTEEN MONTHS BECAUSE I ASK WHAT'S GOING TO MOVE TO ELECTRONIC SYSTEM. AND SO THEREFORE THEY WOULD HAVE TO FILE THESE REPORTS MANUALLY. I GUESS THE CHALLENGE WERE FACED WITH IS THAT. HOSPITALS ALL THE OTHER HOSPITALS IN THE STATE. ARE HAVING TO REPORT THE SAME OR SIMILAR DATA MANUALLY. ALREADY RIGHT SO THEY ARE CURRENTLY DOING IT NOW AND SO I GUESS THE QUESTION IS IS THAT AND THERE YOU KNOW I MEAN WE DON'T WANT TO SUPPOSE EXPECTS FENCES ON EVERYBODY BUT THEY'RE ALSO THEY'RE ACTUALLY OCCURRING THAT EXPENSE OF MANUALLY AND THINGS THAT THE ONLY WAY TO DO. IT RIGHT NOW. I THOUGHT IS MOVING TO ELECTRONIC SYSTEM SO HOPEFULLY EVERYBODY WILL BE ABLE TO MOVE AT THE SAME TIME -- IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS. BUT I THINK THE CHALLENGES SO THE QUESTION IS IS THIS IT'S NOT THAT KAISER CAN'T REPORT THE DATA [inaudible] RIGHT. BUT IT WOULD TAKE SOME EXTRA EFFORT TO DO THAT BUT EVERY OTHER HOSPITAL IN THE STATE IS CURRENTLY REQUIRED BY LAW TO EXERT THAT EFFORT THEMSELVES TO DO THAT. AND SO YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S A QUESTION IF THERE IF THERE'S A SO THIS IS LIKE THIS FINAL LITTLE BIT BUT THERE'S A QUESTION OF FAIRNESS ABOUT WELL. IF KAISER DOESN'T HAVE TO DO IT EVERY OTHER HOSPITAL AND THEY HAVE BY THE WAY THEY'RE SPENDING MONEY TRY YOU KNOW PROVIDING THAT INFORMATION AND THAT INFORMATION IS USEFUL. I MEAN IT'S NOT IT'S NOT JUST LIKE ALWAYS WANT YOU FILL OUT PAPER JUST STOPPED PAPER. IT IS IT IS IT USEFUL TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON YOU KNOW AT SO YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS IS IT FAIR TO SAY WELL BECAUSE YOU HAVE IT WOULDN'T GIVE YOU EXTRA TIME. VERSES EVERYONE ELSE TO ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO IT STILL HAS TO DO IT RIGHT AND I THINK THAT'S THAT THAT THAT'S THE BIT WERE STRUGGLING WITH BECAUSE I CERTAINLY HEAR WHAT KINDS ARE SAYING YOU KNOW WE HAVE A DUE TO WE RAMP UP AND SO FORTH BUT IT'S NOT. THAT THEY CAN'T DO IT IT'S JUST THAT. THEY SAID YEAH IT DOES TAKE -- SOME EXTRA PEOPLE SOME EXTRA WORK BUT EVERY OTHER HOSPITAL. WE'VE ACTUALLY MADE ALSO THEY'RE READY HAVE MEET THEY HAVE TO ALSO SPEND THAT EXPENSE DOING IT AS WELL AND I AM GLAD THAT OXFORD'S MOVING TO A SYSTEM THEY'LL ACTUALLY REQUIRE LESS EFFORT IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS. BUT UNTIL THEN EVERY OTHER HOSPITAL CLEAN HOSPITALS IN YOUR DISTRICT ARE NOT KAISER ARE. TAKING THE TIME TO DO THAT SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THE DATA AND WE NEED TO DO THE OVERSIGHT AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HAVING. THIS YEAH WE DECIDE NOT TO TAKE THEM AND THAT -- YEAH. BUT THE FAIRNESS ISSUE THERE. NO IT IS AND I APPRECIATE THAT RESPONSE YOU KNOW AND JUST RIDLEY ALL ALL WRAPPED UP BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A LONG COMMITTEE. IN ON ON THE ON THE STRICTLY BUSINESS SIDE OF IT YOU KNOW COMING FROM OUR OUR FAMILY SIDE A MUCH SMALLER SMALLER SCALE LIKE WHEN WE IMPLEMENT A NEW PROCEDURE WHETHER WE HAVEN'T DONE IT BEFORE. AND THEN IT'S GOING TO CHANGE IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGAIN IT'S KIND OF DOUBLE NOT SAYING THAT THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT PRIOR NOT SEEN ANY OF THAT. BUT JUST KIND LIKE THIS DOUBLE WHAMMY SO WHAT KIND OF TEACHING AN OLD DOG NEW TRICKS TWICE. YES THAT'S MY ONLY CONCERN WITH THIS BUT I ACTUALLY -- I RESPECT YOUR POSITION ON THIS AND I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL IN CONCERT YOU'VE TAKEN SO FAR PROJECT OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE. YOU KNOW I JUST A COMMENT -- ALONG THE SAME LINES -- YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM THERE IT'S THINK KAISER'S HAD AN EXCEPTION TO THIS FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS -- THIS REPORTING REQUIREMENT AND AS WE HEARD I BELIEVE. INFORMATION IS POWER AND IS IMPORTANT I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SO -- GRANTED THERE IS EXPENSE TO EVERYTHING WE DO AND THE OTHER HOSPITALS OF ENCOURAGING THESE EXPENSES FOR MANY MANY YEARS AND WE'RE GETTING VALUABLE INFORMATION FROM THAT. I THINK AN EIGHTEEN MONTH DELAY IS IS UNFAIR TO OTHERS IN CALIFORNIA WE COULD BE BENEFITING FROM THAT INFORMATION. AND WHICH IS WHY WE DIDN'T ASK YOU TO TAKE THAT AMENDMENT. AND I WOULD HOPE THAT AS BLOOM WAS FOR THAT WE WE STAY THE COURSE ON THAT BECAUSE I THINK THIS INFORMATION IS VERY IMPORTANT. SO -- WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE SENATOR. I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I THAT THANK YOU AND I DO WANNA THANK HIGHS ARE FOR ALL THE WORK THEY'VE DONE TO US SO WE CAN TRY TO COME TOGETHER ON THIS THANK YOU.
