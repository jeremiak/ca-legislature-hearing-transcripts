FOUR MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR.

00:26:02.527 --> 00:26:04.129
THEY CHARGE US BASED ON THE

00:26:04.195 --> 00:26:06.164
HOURS THAT WE USE SO WE DON'T

00:26:06.231 --> 00:26:07.866
USE ALL THE FUNDS EVERY YEAR WE

00:26:07.933 --> 00:26:09.534
DON'T EXPEND ALL OF THAT IT ALL

00:26:09.601 --> 00:26:11.569
DEPENDS ON HOW COMPLEX OUR CASES

00:26:11.636 --> 00:26:11.770
ARE.

00:26:11.836 --> 00:26:13.805
WITH A LOT OF INVOLVED A LOT OF

00:26:13.872 --> 00:26:16.908
EXPERT WITNESSES TRAVEL WHETHER

00:26:16.975 --> 00:26:18.009
THEY GO TO TRIAL.

00:26:18.076 --> 00:26:19.544
AND WE'RE ASKING TO UP OR

00:26:19.611 --> 00:26:20.879
AUTHORITY AND MILLION DOLLARS

00:26:20.946 --> 00:26:22.247
BECAUSE WE HAVE BUMPED UP

00:26:22.314 --> 00:26:23.615
AGAINST THAT THREE POINT FOUR

00:26:23.682 --> 00:26:24.616
MILLION DOLLARS.

00:26:24.683 --> 00:26:26.251
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'VE HAD THESE

00:26:26.318 --> 00:26:28.286
COMPLICATED TRIALS GRANT IS

00:26:28.353 --> 00:26:30.622
BEATING AND INCREASED COSTS FOR

00:26:30.689 --> 00:26:31.790
TWO REASONS.

00:26:31.856 --> 00:26:33.258
FIRST OF ALL.

00:26:33.325 --> 00:26:34.292
WE ARE PURSUING ADDITIONAL

00:26:34.359 --> 00:26:35.961
EMISSION STANDARDS CASES WE'VE

00:26:36.027 --> 00:26:37.329
HEARD ABOUT THE V. VOLKSWAGEN

00:26:37.395 --> 00:26:38.964
CASE WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THE FIAT

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:40.265
CHRYSLER CASE.

00:26:40.332 --> 00:26:41.800
IN THOSE CASES THE AG'S OFFICE

00:26:41.866 --> 00:26:43.268
ACTUALLY DIDN'T CHARGE US FOR

00:26:43.335 --> 00:26:44.903
THE LITIGATION COSTS BECAUSE

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:46.638
THERE IS A CONSUMER COMPONENT.

00:26:46.705 --> 00:26:48.106
AND THE CONSUMER LAW SECTION WAS

00:26:48.173 --> 00:26:50.475
INVOLVED AND SO THE AG'S OFFICE

00:26:50.542 --> 00:26:51.676
ABSORB THOSE COSTS AND THEN

00:26:51.743 --> 00:26:53.712
RECEIVED REIMBURSEMENT AS PART

00:26:53.778 --> 00:26:55.080
OF THE SETTLEMENTS.

00:26:55.146 --> 00:26:56.281
WE ARE WORKING TO INVESTIGATE

00:26:56.348 --> 00:26:58.116
ADDITIONAL EMISSION CASES RIGHT

00:26:58.183 --> 00:26:59.117
NOW.

00:26:59.184 --> 00:27:00.585
THE CONSUMER LAW SECTION AT THE

00:27:00.652 --> 00:27:02.220
AGES IS NOT INVOLVED SO THEY

00:27:02.287 --> 00:27:03.655
HAVE STARTED TO CHARGES FOR

00:27:03.722 --> 00:27:04.956
THOSE CASES.

00:27:05.023 --> 00:27:06.458
THE SECOND REASON IS AS THIS

00:27:06.524 --> 00:27:08.159
COMMITTEE KNOWS WE ARE CURRENTLY

00:27:08.226 --> 00:27:09.427
ENGAGED IN A FIGHT WITH THE

00:27:09.494 --> 00:27:10.996
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OVER.

00:27:11.062 --> 00:27:12.430
THE RIGHT OF CALIFORNIA TO SET

00:27:12.497 --> 00:27:14.199
OUR OWN ADMISSION STANDARDS

00:27:14.265 --> 00:27:15.266
THEY'RE TRYING TO ROLL BACK OUR

00:27:15.333 --> 00:27:16.668
STANDARDS WHICH IS GOING TO MAKE

00:27:16.735 --> 00:27:17.535
IT HARDER.

00:27:17.602 --> 00:27:19.270
IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO MEET OUR

00:27:19.337 --> 00:27:20.572
CLEAN AIR AND CLIMATE GOALS.

00:27:20.638 --> 00:27:22.273
SO WE'VE ALREADY FILED A FREEDOM

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:23.908
OF INFORMATION ACT REQUEST TO

00:27:23.975 --> 00:27:29.681
TRY TO FIND OUT WHAT LEGAL BASIS

00:27:29.748 --> 00:27:31.649
THEY HAVE ROLLING BACK THE

00:27:31.716 --> 00:27:32.150

WAY.

00:46:54.311 --> 00:46:56.146
THAT EXPENDITURE CONCEPT I

00:46:56.213 --> 00:46:58.182
BELIEVE INFLUENCE THE BUDGET ACT

00:46:58.248 --> 00:47:00.384
OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN OUR

00:47:00.450 --> 00:47:01.385

00:47:15.799 --> 00:47:17.734
WHY ARE WE IN THE SPOT?

00:47:17.801 --> 00:47:19.269

BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT IS ONE OF

00:47:20.637 --> 00:47:21.838

WE HARD TO AVOID.

00:49:45.882 --> 00:49:47.751
THAT COST IS ABOUT ONE POINT

00:49:47.818 --> 00:49:48.285
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR A

00:49:48.352 --> 00:49:49.553

00:49:49.619 --> 00:49:52.489
WE USE THE REMAINING FIVE

HUNDRED THOUSAND TO COVER A

ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN OF

00:50:02.499 --> 00:50:04.668
OUR BEST AND BRIGHTEST FOLKS. TO

00:50:04.735 --> 00:50:06.470

I'M VERY SERIOUS ABOUT THIS

00:50:08.071 --> 00:50:09.206
BEING THE DEPARTMENTS ONE

00:50:09.272 --> 00:50:11.775
OPPORTUNITY. TO COMPLETE OUR

00:50:11.842 --> 00:50:12.909
EFFORT ON BUILDING TRUST

00:50:12.976 --> 00:50:14.845
TRANSPARENCY IN CANDOR.

00:50:14.911 --> 00:50:17.514
OUR HUNDRED FIFTEEN FOLKS HAVE

00:50:17.581 --> 00:50:18.281
GONE THROUGH A RIGOROUS

00:50:18.348 --> 00:50:19.750
ANALYTICAL EFFORT AND HAVE

00:50:19.816 --> 00:50:22.519

WE PROVIDE TO THE PUBLIC.

00:50:25.489 --> 00:50:26.523
NOW AS WE GO THROUGH THE

00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:28.692
INEVITABLE ARE YOU A LUMBER OR

00:50:28.759 --> 00:50:29.826
SPLITTER.

00:50:29.893 --> 00:50:31.428
I THINK THAT MAY BOIL DOWN TO

00:50:31.495 --> 00:50:33.363
ABOUT TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED

00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:33.897
TASKS.

00:50:33.964 --> 00:50:34.898
BUT NONE THE LESS WE'RE IN THE

00:50:34.965 --> 00:50:37.067
MIDDLE OF A DATA RICH.

00:50:37.134 --> 00:50:39.503
KIND OF REVIEW AND ASSESSMENT OF

00:50:39.569 --> 00:50:41.538
WHAT WE ACTUALLY DO.

00:50:41.605 --> 00:50:43.240
WITH HOSTED MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDER

MEETINGS WE'VE ENGAGED OUR

00:50:45.609 --> 00:50:47.411
EXTERNAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE OF

00:50:47.477 --> 00:50:48.578

HAPPENS WITH THE REMAINDER OF

00:50:54.484 --> 00:50:56.186
THIS PHASE.

00:50:56.253 --> 00:50:58.221
I BELIEVE AS WE GO TO ABOUT THE

00:50:58.288 --> 00:50:59.990
FALL OF THIS YEAR.

00:51:00.056 --> 00:51:01.925

ALL THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE WORK.

00:51:10.033 --> 00:51:12.569
WHY ISSUE A AND THE REQUEST FOR

00:51:12.636 --> 00:51:14.738
AN ADDITIONAL TWO MILLION?

00:51:14.805 --> 00:51:16.907
LET ME PAUSE THERE I CAN EXPLAIN

00:51:16.973 --> 00:51:18.608
THE SPRING FINANCE LETTER AS

00:51:18.675 --> 00:51:19.543
ISSUE.

00:51:19.609 --> 00:51:21.011
EIGHT OR FIELD ANY QUESTIONS YOU

00:51:21.077 --> 00:51:22.145
MAY HAVE ON JUST THE SERVICE

00:51:22.212 --> 00:51:23.947
BASED BUDGETING BEFORE WE GO

00:51:24.014 --> 00:51:31.288
INTO THAT -- JUST QUICK QUESTION

00:51:31.354 --> 00:51:33.990
I VIEW OF YOU CAN INDULGE OUR

00:51:34.057 --> 00:51:35.058
SHARES SO SHOULD SOME LIGHT INTO

00:51:35.125 --> 00:51:36.793
THE WHAT THE INITIAL FINDINGS

00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:37.694
ARE.

00:51:37.761 --> 00:51:40.297
A WHAT WHAT DELAYED HAS HAS --

00:51:40.363 --> 00:51:43.600
INDICATED OR FOUND AMONGST YOUR

00:51:43.667 --> 00:51:44.634
THIS REVIEW YES.

00:51:44.701 --> 00:51:46.636
THIS IS MY TRANSLATION OF WHAT

00:51:46.703 --> 00:51:48.438
I'M SEEING AS DIRECTOR I'M

00:51:48.505 --> 00:51:49.773
MAKING SURE I PERSONALLY

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:51.174
INVOLVED ON A WEEKLY BASIS

00:51:51.241 --> 00:51:51.475
[inaudible]

00:51:51.541 --> 00:51:57.047
I SEE. THREE MAIN TAKEAWAYS FOR

00:51:57.113 --> 00:51:59.816
ME SO FAR FIRST.

00:51:59.883 --> 00:52:02.686
I THINK THE DELOITTE PROCESS HAS.

00:52:02.752 --> 00:52:06.156
FORCED US TO STOP THINKING ABOUT

00:52:06.223 --> 00:52:09.025
HOW WE IDENTIFY OURSELVES.

00:52:09.092 --> 00:52:09.993
WITHIN THE BUREAUCRACY OF OUR

00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:11.661
DEPARTMENT.

00:52:11.728 --> 00:52:14.097
BUT RATHER ASK OUR CUSTOMERS AND

00:52:14.164 --> 00:52:15.499
CLIENTS.

00:52:15.565 --> 00:52:16.967
HOW THEY THINK WE SHOULD

00:52:17.033 --> 00:52:18.635
IDENTIFY OURSELVES SO IT'S

00:52:18.702 --> 00:52:20.237
HELPED US SHIFT OUR FOCUS FROM

00:52:20.303 --> 00:52:22.539
INTERNAL? TO EXTERNAL.

00:52:22.606 --> 00:52:24.741
BECAUSE ONE OF THE TASKS IS

00:52:24.808 --> 00:52:26.209
DEFINING YOUR SERVICES.

00:52:26.276 --> 00:52:28.912
CONNECTED TO YOUR LABOR HOURS.

00:52:28.979 --> 00:52:30.247
NOT AS WE SEE IT.

00:52:30.313 --> 00:52:32.949
BUT AS OUR CUSTOMERS SO I THINK

00:52:33.016 --> 00:52:33.583
THAT'S BEEN INCREDIBLY VALUABLE

00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:37.621
SECOND.

00:52:37.687 --> 00:52:40.323
I THINK IT'S ALLOWED US TO LOOK

00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:41.691
THROUGH THREE THOUSAND PLUS

00:52:41.758 --> 00:52:43.560
ITEMS.

00:52:43.627 --> 00:52:44.828
AND IS THE BEGINNING OF THE

00:52:44.895 --> 00:52:46.096
DISCUSSION ARE SOME OF THOSE

00:52:46.162 --> 00:52:48.798
NECESSARY ARE THEY RELEVANT.

00:52:48.865 --> 00:52:50.634
ARE THEY REDUNDANT ARE THERE

00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:52.536
EFFICIENCIES TO BE HAD WITHIN

00:52:52.602 --> 00:52:55.438
THAT SORTING OF TASKS.

00:52:55.505 --> 00:52:57.807
AND THEN LASTLY I'D SAY.

00:52:57.874 --> 00:52:59.409
AND THIS SURPRISE ME FRANKLY

00:52:59.476 --> 00:53:01.177
ASSEMBLYMEMBER FONG.

00:53:01.244 --> 00:53:03.013
I THOUGHT I WOULD FACE MORE

00:53:03.079 --> 00:53:05.315
INTERNAL RESISTANCE AND ACTUALLY

00:53:05.382 --> 00:53:06.950
IN THAT CAST OF ABOUT A HUNDRED

00:53:07.017 --> 00:53:08.418
AND TWENTY FOLKS I'M FINDING IT

00:53:08.485 --> 00:53:09.719
IS YES.

00:53:09.786 --> 00:53:12.422
AN ABILITY TO USE A TOOL.

00:53:12.489 --> 00:53:13.657
AND ACTUALLY COME OUT WITH A

00:53:13.723 --> 00:53:16.092
PRODUCT THAT WILL HELP OUR STAFF

00:53:16.159 --> 00:53:17.661
IN THEIR DAILY LIVES.

00:53:17.727 --> 00:53:19.396
BECAUSE THE TOOL WOULD BE USABLE

00:53:19.462 --> 00:53:22.032
REGULARLY UPDATED ANNUALLY IS

00:53:22.098 --> 00:53:23.667
ACTUALLY A DIGITAL PASSPORT THAT

00:53:23.733 --> 00:53:25.035
ALLOWS YOU TO LOOK AT ALL THIS

00:53:25.101 --> 00:53:26.002
QUANTIFICATION.

00:53:26.069 --> 00:53:28.038
SO OWES THE THREE MAIN THINGS I

00:53:28.104 --> 00:53:30.941
SEE SO FAR.

00:53:31.007 --> 00:53:34.744
SO HE I'M SORRY.

00:53:34.811 --> 00:53:36.880
NOW THAT CLEARS ISSUE A ISSUE

00:53:36.947 --> 00:53:38.515
EIGHT IS OUR REQUESTS THROUGH

00:53:38.582 --> 00:53:40.083
SPRING FINANCE LETTER FOR A ONE

00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:41.851
TIME AUGMENTATION OF TWO MILLION

00:53:41.918 --> 00:53:43.920
DOLLARS FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL

00:53:43.987 --> 00:53:46.923
LICENSE PLATE FUND [inaudible]

00:53:46.990 --> 00:53:48.124
TO ALLOW US TO COMPLETE WHAT WE

00:53:48.191 --> 00:53:51.127
CALL PHASE.

00:53:51.194 --> 00:53:53.496
TWO I TELL YOU TODAY THAT WE

00:53:53.563 --> 00:53:55.065
WILL GO THROUGH THIS FALL.

00:53:55.131 --> 00:53:56.933
AND COMPLETE ALL OF THE LARGE

00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:58.635
BODY OF WORK.

00:53:58.702 --> 00:54:00.403
BUT A MORE IN POURTANT TASK MAY

00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:02.405
EMERGING FACE.

00:54:02.472 --> 00:54:03.840
TO AFTER WE'RE DONE WITH THAT I

00:54:03.907 --> 00:54:06.309
THINK.

00:54:06.376 --> 00:54:08.011
THE LONG RUN SUCCESS IS

00:54:08.078 --> 00:54:08.311
[inaudible]

00:54:08.378 --> 00:54:11.681
DEPENDED ON ME EDUCATING THREE

00:54:11.748 --> 00:54:13.817
THOUSAND EMPLOYEES.

00:54:13.883 --> 00:54:16.686
WHY THIS IS THE RIGHT TOOL? TO

00:54:16.753 --> 00:54:19.756
USE FOR OUR FUTURE.

00:54:19.823 --> 00:54:21.391
EDUCATING THE PUBLIC HOW TO

00:54:21.458 --> 00:54:23.760
CONSISTENTLY USE IT.

00:54:23.827 --> 00:54:25.495
AND TRAINING ALL THESE

00:54:25.562 --> 00:54:28.031
CONSTITUENTS AND OUR OWN BODY OF

00:54:28.098 --> 00:54:29.633
EMPLOYEES.

00:54:29.699 --> 00:54:30.934
WE LEARN FROM THE PARKS

00:54:31.001 --> 00:54:33.236

00:54:33.303 --> 00:54:34.671
BRIEFINGS WITH THEM.

00:54:34.738 --> 00:54:37.007
AND THEY HAD A SIGNIFICANT BODY

00:54:37.073 --> 00:54:38.441
OF WORK WHICH WAS ABOUT.

00:54:38.508 --> 00:54:42.812
MAKING THE TOOL A WAY OF LIFE.

00:54:42.879 --> 00:54:45.081
AND THIS TWO MILLION DOLLARS WE

00:54:45.148 --> 00:54:46.082
SEEK TO THE SPRING FINANCE

00:54:48.385 --> 00:54:51.921
SUBSEQUENT PHASE.

00:54:51.988 --> 00:54:56.226
TWO MR FUNG HAS QUESTION JUST --

00:54:56.292 --> 00:54:57.994
TO TO TO DELVE INTO THAT.

00:54:58.061 --> 00:54:59.763
WHAT GOES INTO THIS --

00:54:59.829 --> 00:55:00.764
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TOOL

00:55:00.830 --> 00:55:02.799

00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:11.274
TECHNOLOGY BUT I'M NOT THE

00:55:11.341 --> 00:55:15.378
TECHNOLOGY EXPERT.

00:55:15.445 --> 00:55:17.180
UNDER OUR CURRENT PHASE ONE

00:55:17.247 --> 00:55:19.082
CONTRACT IN FUNDING WE WILL

00:55:19.149 --> 00:55:21.184
ACTUALLY DEVELOP AN ANALYTICAL

00:55:21.251 --> 00:55:23.586
TOOL IT'S KIND OF A IT'S GOT

00:55:23.653 --> 00:55:26.089
ALGORITHMS AS GOT A DATABASE AND

00:55:26.156 --> 00:55:28.792
ITS SEARCHABLE -- THROUGH

00:55:28.858 --> 00:55:30.927
DIFFERENT INPUTS.

00:55:30.994 --> 00:55:32.562
AND THEN IT WILL.

00:55:32.629 --> 00:55:33.897
DISPLAY IN A PUBLIC OUT FACING

00:55:33.963 --> 00:55:35.632
WAY.

00:55:35.699 --> 00:55:38.368
PIE CHARTS AND BAR GRAPHS IT'LL

00:55:38.435 --> 00:55:42.338
ALLOW YOU US OUR CONSTITUENTS.

00:55:42.405 --> 00:55:44.374
TO ZOOM IN AT REGION OR LAND

00:55:44.441 --> 00:55:46.676
FACILITY LEVEL UNDERSTAND THE

00:55:46.743 --> 00:55:48.478
TASKS RELATED TO WHATEVER YOU'RE

00:55:48.545 --> 00:55:49.813
SEARCHING.

00:55:49.879 --> 00:55:51.614
THE PROJECTED NEED YOU KNOW THE

00:55:51.681 --> 00:55:54.984
UP THE IDEAL VERSION OF THE

00:55:55.051 --> 00:55:56.753
MISSION VERSES THE CURRENT.

00:55:56.820 --> 00:55:58.788
THAT'S THE TOOL WE EXPECT TO

00:55:58.855 --> 00:56:01.558
EMERGE IN THE FALL WITH.

00:56:01.624 --> 00:56:02.926
WE MADE A STRATEGIC DECISION.

00:56:02.992 --> 00:56:04.060
DO WE HAVE THE CAPACITY

00:56:04.127 --> 00:56:05.628
INTERNALLY TO DEVELOP THE WE DID

00:56:05.695 --> 00:56:07.063
A LOT OF CONVERSATION WITH THE

00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:08.998
PARKS DEPARTMENT DETERMINED

00:56:09.065 --> 00:56:09.532
WHETHER WE COULD USE THEIR

00:56:09.599 --> 00:56:10.366
FORMAT.

00:56:10.433 --> 00:56:11.768
AND ADAPTED TO US RATHER THAN

00:56:11.835 --> 00:56:13.269
GOING OUT FOR HIGHER WE MADE

00:56:13.336 --> 00:56:14.571
THAT CHOICE.

00:56:14.637 --> 00:56:15.672
IT'S PROVING OUT TO BE A SOLID

00:56:15.739 --> 00:56:17.207
CHOICE.

00:56:17.273 --> 00:56:18.942
BUT FACE.

00:56:19.008 --> 00:56:20.243
TO THE TWO MILLION DOLLARS WE

00:56:20.310 --> 00:56:23.546
NOW SEE IS ABOUT REALLY.

00:56:23.613 --> 00:56:25.148
MAKING SURE THREE THOUSAND

00:56:25.215 --> 00:56:26.382
EMPLOYEES KNOW HOW TO USE THAT

00:56:26.449 --> 00:56:27.817
THING.

00:56:27.884 --> 00:56:29.719
WELCOME THAT THING USE THAT

00:56:29.786 --> 00:56:31.755
THING IT BECOMES PART OF OUR

00:56:31.821 --> 00:56:33.022
STANDARD PRACTICE FOR BUDGET

00:56:33.089 --> 00:56:34.257
CHANGE PROPOSALS.

00:56:34.324 --> 00:56:35.625
THE MATERIALS WE MIGHT APPEAR

00:56:35.692 --> 00:56:38.027
WITH YOU AS WE DISCUSS FUTURE

00:56:38.094 --> 00:56:39.395
BUDGET.

00:56:39.462 --> 00:56:40.864
THAT'S A WINNING OF THE HEARTS

00:56:40.930 --> 00:56:42.832
AND MINDS AND IT ACTUALLY MAY BE

00:56:42.899 --> 00:56:44.501
HARDER IN THE LONG RUN THAN SOME

00:56:44.567 --> 00:56:46.569
OF THE DATA ANALYTICS SO THIS IS

00:56:46.636 --> 00:56:49.305
THE TOOL EXISTS RIGHT CURRENTLY

00:56:49.372 --> 00:56:50.640
OR IS THAT BEING DEVELOPED.

00:56:50.707 --> 00:56:52.642
IT'S AN ITERATIVE STAGES IT'S

00:56:52.709 --> 00:56:54.344
NOT FINAL AND IT'S NOT IN THE

00:56:54.410 --> 00:56:55.678
PHASE WERE READY TO SHARE.

00:56:55.745 --> 00:56:56.646
BUT I DO THINK THAT'S A

00:56:56.713 --> 00:56:58.148
MILESTONE MOMENT WHEN WE CAN

00:56:58.214 --> 00:57:00.183
SHORT START TO GIVE PEOPLE A

00:57:00.250 --> 00:57:01.084
CHANCE TO TEST DRIVE IT.

00:57:01.151 --> 00:57:03.153
BUDGET IN AND IN AND IN TERMS OF

00:57:03.219 --> 00:57:05.455
THE BUDGET REQUEST DOES THAT

00:57:05.522 --> 00:57:06.489
COMPLETE THE WHOLE THING OR IS

00:57:06.556 --> 00:57:07.490
THIS.

00:57:07.557 --> 00:57:09.692
YEAH BECAUSE I WAS ONE TIME SO

00:57:09.759 --> 00:57:10.894

WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT WAS

00:57:33.316 --> 00:57:34.350
INITIATED BY THE DEPARTMENT AS

00:57:34.417 --> 00:57:36.019
IT WAS A LEGISLATIVE THAT

00:57:36.085 --> 00:57:36.820
THEY'VE REALLY EMBRACED IT AND

THIS POINT SO WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT

00:57:40.690 --> 00:57:43.326
IT WILL YIELD A POSITIVE TOOL

00:57:43.393 --> 00:57:45.995
FOR ALL OF US TO USE.

00:57:46.062 --> 00:57:47.530

SERGEANT A BROCHURE. FOR THE

01:03:34.010 --> 01:03:35.878
COAST OVERNIGHT PROGRAM THIS IS

01:03:35.945 --> 01:03:37.213
THE PROGRAM THAT WAS CREATED

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:39.815
WITH AB TWO FIFTY THE LOWER COST

01:03:39.882 --> 01:03:42.285
COASTAL ACCOMMODATIONS PROGRAM.

01:03:42.351 --> 01:03:44.320
I'M IT THAT PROGRAM DIRECTED THE

01:03:44.387 --> 01:03:45.955
CONSERVANCY TO COMPLETE AN

01:03:46.022 --> 01:03:48.357
ASSESSMENT -- THAT ASSESSMENT

01:03:48.424 --> 01:03:50.359
WAS COMPLETED IN MARCH PROP

01:03:50.426 --> 01:03:51.394
SIXTY EIGHT INCLUDED THIRTY

01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:52.728
MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE COASTAL

01:03:52.795 --> 01:03:54.630
CONSERVANCY TO FIND OUT THE

01:03:54.697 --> 01:03:55.998
LOWER COST OVERNIGHT

01:03:56.065 --> 01:03:57.466
ACCOMMODATION PROGRAM.

01:03:57.533 --> 01:03:59.468
AND THE BUDGET PROPOSAL WOULD BE

01:03:59.535 --> 01:04:03.739
AN INITIAL -- INITIAL FUNDING TO

01:04:03.806 --> 01:04:06.442
START FINDING THOSE PROJECTS.

01:04:06.509 --> 01:04:08.611
WHAT KIND OF RESULTS YOU GET FOR

01:04:08.678 --> 01:04:09.245
THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS WOULD YOU

01:04:09.312 --> 01:04:11.847
ANTICIPATE -- DOESN'T SOUND LIKE

01:04:11.914 --> 01:04:13.549
MUCH MONEY GIVEN YEAH WELL I

01:04:13.616 --> 01:04:15.551
WILL HAVE THE SEAT THERE'S

01:04:15.618 --> 01:04:16.152
THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE

01:04:16.219 --> 01:04:17.153
COASTAL CONSERVANCY THERE'S

01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:18.955
ANOTHER THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS

ACCOMMODATIONS IN STATE PARKS I

01:04:23.659 --> 01:04:25.428
THINK IT REALLY DEPENDS ON

01:04:25.494 --> 01:04:26.462
WHETHER WE'RE BUILDING NEW

01:04:26.529 --> 01:04:28.130
FACILITIES.

01:04:28.197 --> 01:04:31.033
OR ADDING ON AND I DON'T I DON'T

THINK WE HAVE A SPECIFIC ANSWER

01:04:32.735 --> 01:04:34.704
OF HOW MANY UNITS WE THINK WE'LL

01:04:34.770 --> 01:04:37.106

MY DISTRICT THAT THE BANK --

01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:47.183
BRANCH MOTEL I THINK IS -- ON

01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:51.821
PCH WHICH HAS BEEN SITTING THERE.

01:04:51.887 --> 01:04:52.355
FOR THE DETERIORATING FOR

01:04:52.421 --> 01:04:54.624

MIKE RIGHT IN THAT YEAH -- THAT

01:04:56.525 --> 01:04:57.927
THE STATE PARK PROJECT BUT I

01:04:57.994 --> 01:04:59.562
THAT SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT AND I

01:04:59.629 --> 01:05:01.430
KNOW THAT THAT ONE ALONE WILL BE

01:05:01.497 --> 01:05:03.733
FAIRLY EXPENSIVE AT THE HISTORIC.

01:05:03.799 --> 01:05:06.102
PROPERTY SO THE RENOVATIONS ARE

01:05:06.168 --> 01:05:09.138

01:05:09.205 --> 01:05:11.574
BUT ALSO A GREAT OPPORTUNITY IN

TERMS OF ITS LOCATION IT WOULD

01:05:13.843 --> 01:05:16.045
BE NICE TO HAVE A ROAD MAP FOR

01:05:16.112 --> 01:05:19.715
PROJECTS LIKE THAT -- SO THAT WE

01:05:19.782 --> 01:05:21.917

GETTING -- GETTING THOSE FUNDED

01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:26.656

TRICKLE OF MONEY -- AND AND THE

01:05:29.725 --> 01:05:33.296
TIMELINE FOR REALLY DOING SOME

01:05:33.362 --> 01:05:34.030
GOOD ON THIS ISSUE.

01:05:34.096 --> 01:05:34.697
