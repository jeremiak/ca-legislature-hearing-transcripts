MEMBERS OF A QUORUM IS PRESENT WE ASK OUR GUESTS AND VISITORS IN THE REAR OF THE CHAMBER AND IN THE GALLERY TO PLEASE STAND FOR THE PRAYER. THE DAYS PRAYER WILL BE OFFERED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GABRIEL. LAST WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON I RECEIVED THE CALL. SOMEONE OUT OF THE BLUE I JOIN THE FAMILY FACE TIME WHERE MY FATHER SHARED DISTURBING NEWS. AFTER COMPLAINING FOR SEVERAL MONTHS OF PERSISTENT NECK PAIN AN MRI HAD REVEALED CONCERNING ABNORMALITIES. BASED ON THE MRI AND OTHER SYMPTOMS THE DOCTORS RAISED THE PROSPECT OF A RARE AND HIGHLY DEADLY FORM OF METASTATIC BLOOD AND BONE CANCER WITH AN EXPECTED SURVIVAL RATE. THAT LEFT US BREATHLESS IN A MOMENT MY WORLD WAS TURNED UPSIDE DOWN. PRIOR TO THE CALL MY AFTERNOON HAD BEEN FILLED WITH THE TYPICAL FRUSTRATIONS AND ANNOYANCES THAT TOO OFTEN MARK END OF SESSION IN THE LEGISLATURE. DISTRACTIONS FROM THE REAL AND URGENT WORK OF SERVING THE PEOPLE. IN THE MY AFTER THE CALL ALL OF THAT MELTED AWAY. WE ARE APPROACHING THE SEASON THE HIGH HOLIDAYS WHICH WILL BE CELEBRATED BY COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA ISRAEL AND AROUND THE WORLD. IN WAYS SUBTLE AND OBVIOUS THE HIGH HOLIDAYS- JUST TO CONSIDER OUR MORTALITY. TO CONFRONT THE INESCAPABLE REALITY THAT OUR TIME ON THIS PLANET IS FINITE. THE CONFRONTATION WITH OUR OWN INEVITABLE DEATH IS NOT MEANT TO SCARE US BUT RATHER TO ENCOURAGE THE DIFFICULT WORK OF REFLECTION AND INTROSPECTION. TO HELP US ASK OURSELVES THE TOUGH QUESTIONS. ARE WE LIVING THE LIFE WE INTENDED. ARE WE BEING TRUE TO OURSELVES ARE WE SPENDING OUR PRECIOUS TIME AND ENERGY ON WHAT REALLY MATTERS. WITH LUCK WE WILL COME OUT OF THE HIGH HOLIDAYS WITH A RENEWED SENSE OF PURPOSE AND PERSPECTIVE. WE WILL LAY DOWN OLD GRIEVANCES SET ASIDE NEEDLESS DISTRACTIONS AND REFOCUS ON THAT WHICH IS MOST DESERVING OF OUR TIME AND TALENTS AND ENERGY. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS MY DAD HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO A BATTERY OF BLOOD TESTS AND SCANS. MY FAMILY HASN'T TOWARD SLEEPLESS NIGHTS AND EXTREME FEAR. SOMEHOW BY THE INCREDIBLE GRACE OF GOD THE RESULTS OF THOSE TESTS HAVE SURPRISED HIS DOCTORS AND DELIGHTED OUR FAMILY. GONE IS THE SHADOW OF CANCER REPLACED BY DIAGNOSIS OF AILMENTS THAT WHILE DIFFICULT ARE FAR LESS SCARY. WE HAVE STEPPED BACK FROM THE ABYSS. HELLO HELLO HELLO HELLO TENOVER IN MONTANA ARE GOD AND GOD OF OUR ANCESTORS. AS WE APPROACH THE FINAL DAYS OF A DIFFICULT SESSION MAY WE BE GRANTED THE PERSPECTIVE AND INSIGHT TO DECIPHER WHAT REALLY MATTERS. TO SEPARATE THE HOLY WORK OF PUBLIC SERVICE FROM THE DISTRACTIONS OF PETTY POLITICS. TO SEE THE BEST IN EACH OTHER. TO APPRECIATE THE PASSION OF OUR COLLEAGUES STAFF CONSTITUENTS IN ADVOCATES INCLUDING THOSE WITH WHOM WE MAY NOT ALWAYS AGREE. TO RISE ABOVE THE NOISE AND FOCUS ON THE IMMENSE PRIVILEGE WE HAVE BEFORE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE LAWS THAT CAN UPLIFT OUR COMMUNITIES ADVANCINGJUSTICE AND HEAL OUR WORLD. TO RECALL WITH CLARITY WHY WE ARE HERE AND WHAT WE ARE FIGHTING FOR. IN MAY WE ARE TIRED CAPITAL COMMUNITY AND ALL HUMANKIND BE GRANTED THE ULTIMATE BLESSINGS OF GOOD HEALTH. A MAN.

ASSEMBLY HOUSE RESOLUTION ONE OH FIVE. URGES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PRESERVE THEIR OPERATIONAL CAPACITY OF THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE AND BY EXTENSION THE INTEGRITY OF OUR AMERICAN DEMOCRACY. WHEN BET MAIL IN BALLOTS PRESENT THE ONLY SAFE OPTION TO VOTE IN THE COMING ELECTION. MANY OF US DON'T REMEMBER THE MODEL OF THE U. S. POSTAL SYSTEM. THE RAIN NEITHER SNOW. NOR RAIN NOR HEAT NOR GLOOM OF NIGHT STAYS THESE CURRENT THESE COURTEOUS FROM THE SWIFT COMPLETION OF THEIR APPOINTED ROUNDS WE PROBABLY COULD ADD PANDEMIC. BECAUSE NONE OF US HAVE HAD TO DIMINISH DIMINISH CAPACITY OF US GETTING OUR MAIL AT THIS TIME. IN RECOGNITION OF THE CURRENT CHALLENGES WE AS A LEGISLATOR LEGISLATIVE BODY HAVE VOTED TO SEND EVERY REGISTERED VOTER IN CALIFORNIA A MAIL IN BALLOT. IN RECOGNITION THIS DECISION WAS MADE WITH THE HEALTH AND WELFARE OF THE PUBLIC IN MIND AS OUR STATE PRICE TO OVERCOME COVERT NINETEEN. WHICH HAS ALREADY INFECTED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS AND IMPACTED THE LIVES OF COUNTLESS MORE. THE DEVASTATION OF COVERT NINETEEN HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY HAPPY AND THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES WHICH HAS ALREADY HAD TO DEAL WITH NEARLY A HUNDRED THOUSAND CASES AND APPROX ME TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DEATHS. AMONG THE HARDEST HIT HAVE BEEN THOSE OF THE LATINO COMMUNITY WHO MADE UP ABOUT 50% OF ALL KNOWN CASES IN LOS ANGELES. MY OWN DISTRICT WHICH IS LARGELY LATINO AND I HAVE BEEN WORKING TIRELESSLY PROTECT THEM DURING THIS PANDEMIC. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS AMPLE EXPERIENCE WITH MAIL IN BALLOTS WITH THE INSTRUCTION OF ABSENTEE VOTING SINCE THE NINETEEN TWENTIES. CALIFORNIA VOTERS HAVE HISTORICALLY FAVORED THE OPTION TO VOTE BY MAIL AND SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE TO STATE HAS ALLOWED ANY REGISTERED VOTER REGARDLESS OF STATUS AND CIRCUMSTANCE TO VOTE REMOTELY IF THEY SO CHOOSE. DURING THE MARCH TWENTY TWENTY PRIMARY ELECTIONS AS COVERT NINETEEN BEGAN TO AFFECT EVERY ASPECT OF DAILY LIFE I 72% OF VOTERS CAST THEIR BALLOT BY MAIL. YOU CAN BE SURE IT MATTERED THAT THEY HAD A WORKING ANY FISSION POSTAL SERVICE. THERE IS NO. EXCUSE FOR THE TIMING OF POSTMASTER GENERAL LEWIS THE JOYS RESTRUCTURING. OF THE US POSTAL SERVICE I NONPARTISAN INSTITUTION THAT HAS SINCE. SEVENTEEN SEVENTY FIVE CERTAINLY AMERICAN PEOPLE IN GOOD FAITH. SENSES INSTALLATION IN MAY OF THIS YEAR TO THE POSITION OF POSTMASTER GENERAL. MISTER DETROIT HAS WORKED PURPOSE FULLY TO LIMIT THE POST. SERVICES THE POSTAL SERVICE'S OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY THESE EFFORTS HAVE INCLUDED BANNING OVERTIME AND AFTER DELIVERY A TRIP TRIPS REMOVING COUNTLESS MAILBOXES THROUGHOUT THE NATION. AND WITHDRAWING MAIL SORTING MACHINES FROM POST OFFICES INCLUDING SEVENTY SIX THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND EIGHTEEN IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES ALONE. IN THE NAME OF COST REDUCTION THE POSTAL SERVICE IS BEING SYSTEMATICALLY CRIPPLED BY AN ADMINISTRATION DETERMINED TO DISENFRANCHISE VOTERS WHOSE COMMUNITIES HAVE GONE THEY NEGLECTED UNDER ITS CARE. INCLUDING THOSE IN MY OWN DISTRICT AND OTHERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AS THIS IS THIS MANTLING THE POSTAL SERVICE THREATENS TO INHIBIT FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS. SO TOO HAS BEGUN OBSTRUCTING THE LIVES AMERICANS RELY ON PROMPT. AND CONSISTENT DELIVERIES IN CORRESPONDENCE FOR EXAMPLE THE POSTAL SERVICE DELIVERS IT ROUGHLY FOUR MILLION SHIPMENTS A PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION. EVERY DAY. SIX DAY OF. THE RECIPIENTS OF THESE DELIVERIES INCLUDE PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC ILLNESSES THE ELDERLY AND OUR NATION'S VETERANS. ARE WE PREPARED TO LET THEM SUFFER FOR THE SAKE OF COST CUTTING COSTS OR TRULY FOR THE SAKE OF DRIVING VOTERS AWAY. THE CHANGES MADE AT THE POSTAL SERVICE HAS BEEN SUPPORTED BY UNFOUNDED CLAIMS THAT MAILING BALLOTS LEAD TO MASSIVE BORDER VOTER FRAUD. IN TRUTH. RESEARCHERS HAVE AGAIN AND AGAIN DISAPPROVE DISPROVEN THIS CLAIM FINDING IN THE STUDY SAID UNITED STATES HAS SEEN SEEN EXTREMELY LOW RATES ARE FRAUGHT THROUGHOUT ITS ELECTORAL HISTORY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ITSELF HAS IMPLEMENTED NUMEROUS SAFEGUARDS TO PREVENT ABSENTEE VOTER FRAUD INCLUDING SIGNATURE MATCHING AND UNIQUE BARCODES ON EACH BALLOT RETURN ENVELOPE. FURTHERMORE ABSENTEE BALLOTS GIVE ORDERS AND LEVEL FLEXIBILITY TO POLLING CENTRES SIMPLY CANNOT MATCH MAILING VOTING IS POWER TO THE PEOPLE THERE IS MOM THERE IS MUCH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COULD LEARN FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE'RE MAILING VOTERS HAVE BECOME ELECTORAL MAJORITY AND WE'RE WE SOLVE PROBLEMS RATHER THAN SIMPLY BREAKING THINGS DOWN WE DON'T LIKE. WE AS ELECTED OFFICIALS HAD TO DO REALLY HAVE A DUTY TO PROTECT NOT ONLY THE SANCTITY OF OUR FREE ELECTIONS BUT ALSO TO CONTINUE HEALTH AND EFFICIENCY OF THE UNITED STATES POST OFFICE WHOSE MISSION THE POSTAL SERVICE SHALL HABITS IS BASIC PARTISAN THE OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE POSTAL SERVICES. TO BIND THIS NATION. THE ME SAY IT AGAIN BUYING THIS NATION TO MISTER JOHNSON PERSON EDUCATIONAL LEADER LITERACY AND BUSINESS CORRESPONDENCE OF THE OF THE PEOPLE AS YOUR PROVIDE PROMPT RELIABLE AND EFFICIENT SERVICES TO PATRONS IN ALL AREAS. AS SHALL RENDER POSTAL SERVICES TO ALL. ALL COMMUNITIES. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS THANK YOU MISTER JONES SAWYER MR BERMAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I JUST WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SOUTH LOS ANGELES FOR TAKING A LEADERSHIP ROLE- ON THIS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE I'VE SAID TIME AND AGAIN- THAT NO CALIFORNIANS SHOULD HAVE TO RISK. THEIR HEALTH AND POSSIBLY THEIR LIFE TO EXERCISE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO VOTE- BUT IT IN ORDER FOR THAT TO BE THE CASE IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. THAT OUR CIVIC INFRASTRUCTURE- IS STRONG AND FOR THE ELECTION IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE US POSTAL SERVICE. IS STRONG SO THAT EVERYONE HAS THE ABILITY TO VOTE SAFELY FROM HOME AND HAVE THEIR VOICE HEARD- SO I ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY TO VOTE ON AYE ON H. R. ONE OH FIVE- BY OUR MY COLLEAGUE. BECAUSE IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HEAR THE MESSAGE LOUD AND CLEAR THAT WE NEED THEM TO HELP DEFEND OUR DEMOCRACY- AND WHAT'S HAPPENED OVER THE PST.

TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD BE ABLE TO VOTE SAFELY- AND- FROM THE SAFETY OF THEIR OWN HOME AND SUPPORT THE US POSTAL SERVICE WHICH IS ACTUALLY ONE THE MOST POPULAR. FEDERAL AGENCIES IRONICALLY SO THIS IS A WIN WIN FOR EVERYBODY- INCLUDING MOST IMPORTANTLY NO MATTER WHETHER YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN OR NO PARTY PREFERENCE OR ANY OTHER PARTY- IT'S TO DEFEND OUR DEMOCRACY AND I HOPE THAT EVERYBODY CAN BE IN AGREEMENT THAT THAT IS SOMETHING WORTH FIGHTING FOR.

THAT OUR DEMOCRACY IS THE BEDROCK OF OUR OF THIS AMERICAN SOCIETY WE SHOULD NOT BE DOING. ANYTHING THAT'S GOING TO HINGED UPON THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE FROM VOTING IN THIS UPCOMING ELECTION MAIL BALLOT FRAUD IS A MYTH. THAT HAS FREQUENTLY RAIDERS UGLY HEAD AND BEEN DISPROVEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN OUR RECENT PRIMARY ELECTION SHOWS THAT WE HAVE- WE HAVE MAIL IN VOTING STATEWIDE WITHOUT ANY VOTING FRAUD WHILE KEEPING CALIFORNIA AND DEALING WITH A PANDEMIC AT THE SAME TIME. REPORTS VARIES BUT INDICATES BETWEEN TEN TO FIFTEEN PERCENT. SLOWDOWN IN MAIL DELIVERY SERVICES EVEN A SMALL SLOWDOWN COULD DRAMATICALLY AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION AND SIMPLY- WOULD BE INEXCUSABLE IF IN FACT THAT SHOULD HAPPEN. OUR SENIORS DEPENDS ON THEIR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS BEING RECEIVED BY POST OFFICE- SO MUCH PRODUCTS COMES THROUGH THE POSTAL SERVICE WE CANNOT AFFORD THIS TIME TO DIMINISH THEIR RESOURCES AND ALSO THE SERVICES THAT THIS POST OFFICE PROVIDES DAY IN AND DAY OUT.

WHEN MOST OF US IN THE CLASS OF TWENTY SIXTEEN WE'RE STILL LEARNING THEIR COLLEGE NAMES MONIQUE WAS CARING BILLS TAKING ON THE OIL INDUSTRY. NEXT AFTER RISING TO BECOME CHAIR OF THE BANKING COMMITTEE SHE TURNED HER SIGHTS ON THE PAYDAY LENDING INDUSTRY WHICH FOR YEARS. HAD ESCAPED APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT AND REGULATION IN CALIFORNIA. WHEN MONIQUE TOLD ME SHE WAS SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING RUNNING FOR SENATE I DID EVERYTHING I COULD TO OUTWARDLY LOOK LIKE I WAS BEING A SUPPORTIVE FRIEND. WHILE SUBTLY TRYING TO UNDERMINE AND SABOTAGE THE IDEA. THEN ONE DAY MONIQUE AND HER HUSBAND MIKE GOT TOGETHER WITH ME AND MY WIFE AMY FOR LUNCH. AS WELL AS MONIQUE LAID OUT THE PROS AND CONS OF RUNNING ANY WAS QUICK TO AFFIRM ALL OF THE REASONS WHY MONIQUE SHOULD RUN. SHE EVEN CAME UP WITH A FEW REASONS MONIQUE HADN'T THOUGHT OF.

WE'VE HEARD THAT SHE'S ABLE TO FIND COMMON GROUND WITHOUT COMPROMISING HER IDEALS. WE'VE HEARD SHE'S ABLE TO TAKE HERSELF SHE'S ABLE TO NOT TAKE HERSELF TOO SERIOUSLY AND CAN LAUGH AT HERSELF.

IT SO'S GOT OF INTERESTING WHEN THEY TOLD HE WAS COME. THEN I TOLD ME HE'S REALLY RICH THAT'S THE FIRST THING I TOLD HIM ABOUT HIS REALLY RICH. AND HE FLIES HIS OWN PLANE. AND SOMEONE TOLD ME NOT JUST A- LITTLE PLANE THAT JUST PUT PUT PUT BUT IT ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS PLANE. THAT HE FLIES INTO TO THE CAPITOL EVERY BISHOP EVERY WEEK. AND THAT HE LIVES IN A PENTHOUSE. I THOUGHT OH MY GOD YOU KNOW THIS IS A GAME OF THIS BEAUTIFULLY WRAPPED PERSON. AND I THOUGHT OH MY GOODNESS HOW RELEVANT HE'S GONNA BE. AND HOW IT- AGAIN HE'S GOING TO BE. AND HOW HE'S GOING TO MAKE US ALL FEEL% SO SMALL BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE GOOD STUFF HE HAS. AND HOW WILL I EVER EXPLAIN TO HIM. WHAT LIFE IS LIKE IN THE SEVENTY NINTH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT. HOWEVER EXPLAINED TO HIM MY LIFE. AND THOSE THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO ME. THE DRIVE THE EVERYDAY PERSON IN CALIFORNIA. BUT I SAID I WON'T I'LL GIVEN THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT. AND I'LL SEE WHAT IT'S REALLY LIKE. AND THEN WE HAD OUR BOWLING EXPERIENCE AND HE PROBABLY DOESN'T EVEN REMEMBER THIS BECAUSE MY OFFICE WAS KIND OF NEXT TO HIS. AND HE CAN REALLY BOWL. AND I SAID NO RICH DO GLOBAL LIKE THIS. YOU KNOW HOW HE WOULD HAVE HIS BUTLER'S BOWLING HE DIDN'T TAKE THE SCORE I MEAN YOU KNOW THERE'S NO THERE'S NO WAY THAT HE COULD HAVE THIS LEVEL OF BALI AND HE WAS STRIKING THINGS AND HE WAS JUST I MEAN IT REALLY WAS REMINDED ME OF THE DAYS WHEN I WAS A KID AND WE ACTUALLY HAD THESE. FOLKS WHO COULD REALLY BOWL YOU KNOW BECAUSE THIS GENERATION DOESN'T REALLY BALL A LOT BUT NINETY IT NOTHING COULD PRETTY CAN GET HOLD THIS BALDING FROM AND THEN I HAD A CHANCE TO SEE HIS WIFE AND SHE WASN'T YOU KNOW. ALL THAT SHE WAS LIKE YOU KNOW SOMETHING FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY SHE WAS JUST AN ORDINARY EVERYDAY WOMAN. AND I THOUGHT HOME THIS IS A DIFFERENT PERSON THIS IS A DIFFERENT PACKAGE THIS IS CONTENT THAN THE PACKAGE I GOT THAT WAS ALL WRAPPED PRETTY. AND I DECIDED I WOULD INVESTIGATE WHO THIS PERSON IS. AND I BEGAN TO TALK TO HIM. AND I LEARNED IS JUST HOW MUCH HE WAS LIKE ME. A KID WHO GREW UP WITH VERY LITTLE. BUT WHOSE PARENTS BELIEVED STRONGLY IN HIM HIS MOTHER. RAISED IN WITH SOME VERY STRONG VALUES ABOUT LIFE AND PEOPLE AND HIS FAMILY. AND HOW MUCH SHE CARED ABOUT CALIFORNIA. AND HOW MUCH YOU CAN REACH ACROSS THE LINES IN THE IN THE PARTY'S AND BASICALLY GET TO THE ISSUES THAT WOULD BE HERE. I LEARNED HE WAS VERY SMART. AND ONE OF THINGS I'VE ALWAYS TRIED TO MY LIFE BECAUSE PEOPLE LOOK AT YOU AND SAY ALL YOU HAVE ALL THESE DEGREES I'VE TRIED TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD THAT THOSE DEGREES DIDN'T DEFINE ME. THERE WERE THINGS I DID IN ORDER TO MAKE MY LIFE A LITTLE EASIER BUT I WAS STILL THIS LITTLE GIRL FROM PROJECTS. AND WHEN I MET HIM HE WAS STILL THIS ORDINARY PERSON. HE WAS SMART BUT IT WAS AN ARROGANT. AND I COULD SIT AND TALK TO HIM ABOUT EDUCATIONAL ISSUES AND HIS FAMILY AND HIS CHILDREN AND HOW HE WAS RAISING HIS SONS. AND UNDERSTAND THE CONFLICTS THAT HE WAS IN WITH REGARDS TO ONE BEING ONE WAY AND ONE BEING ANOTHER THE KIND OF CHALLENGES THAT FAMILIES HAVE. ANY REALLY WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THEM. I LEARNED A LOT ABOUT HIS WIFE AND HOW MUCH SHE CARED ABOUT HIM AND THE FAMILY. AND HOW HE EVERYTHING HE DID WAS REALLY DESIGNED TO BUILD A STRONG FAMILY. BUT I LEARNED A OF HIM ONE TIME WHEN I WAS MY FAMILY WAS DEBATING WHERE WE'RE GOING TO GO FOR. THE NEW YEAR FOR THANKSGIVING. AND WE HAD A CHOICE BETWEEN JAMAICA.A HAWAII IN BIG BEAR. I WANT TO GO TO BIG BEAR OKAY EVERYBODY ELSE WILL SOMEWHERE ELSE. AND SO I WENT TO JANE I SAID J. CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME RECOMMENDATIONS. OF SOME NICE PLACES IN BIG BEAR WHAT WE COULD STAY WE'LL GET A NICE PLACE TO STAY. SO I SAID SURE I CAN DO THAT. OKAY THANK YOU. SO WHAT I'M GONNA WEAR THAT THURSDAY CAME BACK OF MONDAY HE SAID. YOU DON'T HAVE A LIST FOR YOU HE SAYS BUT- WE HAVE ANOTHER RECOMMENDATION I SAID OKAY WHAT IS THAT. HE SAID. WE'RE GOING TO GO AWAY FOR THANKSGIVING AND YOU CAN HAVE A HOUSE. I SAID WHAT. HE SAID YOU AND YOUR FAMILY CAN STAY AT HOME. AND I THOUGHT THIS IS REALLY WE NEVER HAD SOMEBODY WHO KIND OF KNOWS ME THAT WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT WHO TRUST ME WITH HIS HOUSE. BUT IT ALSO SAID A LOT ABOUT THE FACT THAT POSSESSIONS WERE NOT REALLY THAT IMPORTANT. IT'S NICE TO HAVE BUT IT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO SHARE. AND HE REALLY WAS HONEST ABOUT IT. OF COURSE MY FAMILY CHOSE GO TO Y. COURSE. BUT I FELT SO HONORED I FELT SO HONORED THAT DESPITE THAT YOU KNOW I TOLD WE WOULD WANT TO WHY BUT I TOLD MY FAMILY I SAID YOU KNOW I FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE THAT IF WE WANTED TO GO TO BIG BEAR. THAT WE WOULD NOT BE IMPOSING UPON HIM. AND THAT WAS JUST A SMALL EXAMPLE WHEN I'M STRUGGLING WITH THE ISSUE OF COMING BACK AND WHETHER NOT OF MY AGE IT WOULD BE SMART. WHAT WE WOULD DO THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AND WAS COMMITTEE HEARING IT. WE GOT INFORMATION THAT WE COULD REMOTE AND WE COULDN'T MOVE BACK AND FORTH BACK AND FORTH. AND I SAID WELL IT WAS RIGHT AFTER THE ALL THE PANDEMIC STARTED. AND OFFERED TO PICK ME UP. IN THIS PLANE J. AND I SAID NO I CAN'T HAVE YOU FLY BACK IN GO FORWARD YOU CAN YOU KNOW TO COME GET ME AND I BUT I BUT I KNEW THAT IF I WANTED IT. HE WOULD DO IT. AND HE WOULD DO I WOULD LOVE AND GRATEFULNESS AND WE'RE CALLING THIS. WE HAVE BEEN TRULY BLESSED TODAY BY YOU BEING HERE. BECAUSE YOU STAND OUT IN A VERY UNIQUE WAY. YOU'RE SMART BUT YOU'RE NOT ERICA. YOU'RE KIND AND GENTLE AND WHEN YOU MAKE POINTS ABOUT THINGS WE NEED TO DO WE DON'T FEEL ATTACKED AND OFFENDED. WE FEEL ENLIGHTENED BY YOUR PERSPECTIVE PERSPECTIVE AND WE FEEL THAT YOUR HELPFUL. VERY HELPFUL IN THE ISSUES THAT WE REYES BUT YOU GIVE US A PERSPECTIVE IT'S NOT NECESSARILY GROUNDED JUSTIN PARTY BUT GROUNDED IN FACTS AND INFORMATION AND YOU CHALLENGES EVERYDAY TO BE BETTER. WHEN I HEARD YOU WERE GOING TO RUN FOR. CONGRESS I WAS REALLY SAD. I WAS REALLY SAD BUT IT I KNOW I SAID WELL MAYBE JUST MAYBE THIS IS WHAT CONGRESS NEEDS WHICH IS A TREMENDOUS CHALLENGE TO TAKE SOMEBODY LIKE YOU AND PUTIN THE MIDST OF. ALL THE STUFF THAT'S HAPPENING WHEN YOU REALLY ARE PERSON WHO WANTS THE OF THE FINAL. PRODUCT TO MAKE SURE THAT THINGS ARE BETTER. BUT I WISH YOU WELL. YOU'LL ALWAYS BE MY FRIEND. UNION WIFE WILL ALWAYS BE WELCOME IN SAN DIEGO TO MY HOME. AND I HOPE AT SOME POINT. I WILL GET A CHANCE TO EXPRESS THAT TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY WHEN WE CAN BE. CLOSER TOGETHER. AND BETTER. MORE FRIENDLY. WE WILL COME TO BIG BEAR SOON. I HOPE. IN THE NEAR FUTURE. AND I WILL FEEL EVEN BETTER THAN I DID WHEN I WAS A KID AND USED TO GO TO BIG BEER BECAUSE- I DON'T HAVE TO GO TO A CAMP ACTING THE VISIT JAY OBERNOLTE AND HIS FAMILY. AND KNOW THAT I WILL BE WELCOME. AND I WISH YOU AND YOUR WIFE YOUR FAMILY THE BEST. AND IF CONGRESS DOESN'T WORK OUT YOU STILL HAVE A WHOLE. THANK YOU. THANK.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS- I JUST FOUND OUT THAT WE WERE DOING A TRIBUTE TO J. TODAY AND- REALLY WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I WAS ABLE TO PUT SOME OF MY MEMORIES OUT THERE- MY FIRST RECOGNITION OF WORKING WITH JAY. WAS WHEN I WAS FLOOR LEADER SO I WAS ARE IT WAS A NEW FLOOR LEADER AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON AND J. WAS SITTING OVER THERE I THINK CLOSE TO WHERE FRANK IS SITTING NOW. AND I REMEMBER WE HAD A WHOLE SLEW OF BILLS ADDED TO THE FILE I MEAN THE MUST HAVE BEEN FIFTEEN OR EIGHTEEN BILLS ADDED AND I WENT UP WITH THE LIST AND I STARTED TELLING HIM THE FILE NUMBER IN THE BILL NUMBER AND HE JUST KEPT LOOKING AT ME. AND I'M LIKE IS HE GOING TO WRITE THESE DOWN AND WHY WENT THROUGH THEM ONE AT THE TIME AND HE SAID OKAY I GOT IT AND I'M LIKE THAT'S JAY OBERNOLTE HE HAS A BRAIN I ALWAYS SAID LIKE A COMPUTER JUST TAKES IN THE INFORMATION CAN PROCESS IT IN AN ORDERLY MANNER AND COME OUT WITH AN AMAZING RESULTS AND I WAS I WAS BLOWN AWAY BY THAT SO. THAT'S THE FIRST TIME I HAD WORKED WITH HIM- WHEN I WAS FLOOR LEADER I'M THE WORK IS DONE AS BUDGET CHAIR I MEAN WEEK WE ALL KNOW HOW AMAZING HE'S BEEN. PEAKING WITHOUT NOTES KNOWING. ABOUT THE BUDGET IN. AND OUT WORKING. WITHTHE BUDGET CHAIR- YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN FANTASTIC WE'RE- AND- YOU KNOW IS THIS THE- BEEN SUCH AN ASSET TO OUR HOUSE. AS WE WORK ON THAT VERY IMPORTANT. ISSUE HERE IN THE ASSEMBLY- WHEN I BECAME LEADER. I APPOINTED JAY TO BE OUR CAUCUS CHAIR. HE HAS BEEN THERE. PRETTY MUCH ALL THE TIME I THINK HE'S ONLY MISSED ONE MEETING. ALWAYS ALWAYS READY ALWAYS PREPARED. RUNNING OUR OUR CAUCUS AND I'VE APPRECIATED THAT VERY MUCH YOU KNOW IT ABOUT SOME OF THE PERSONAL THINGS HE'S VERY BALANCED IN HIS LIFE HE THOSE THOSE TRIATHLONS AND ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF EVENTS LIKE THAT. YOU KNOW THAT KEEPS YOU KIND OF A MORE OF A BALANCE- WHEN I MY FAMILY WENT UP TO LAKE ARROWHEAD. I CALLED JAY AND HEATHER AND I SAID ALL WERE UP HERE AND- THEY CAME OVER ALL THE WAY I KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING THE NEEDLES I THINK THAT. THAT WEEKEND WHICH IS DISTRICT IS HUGE SO HE HAD ACTUALLY THAT- OBLIGATION TO DO CAME DOWN TO LAKE ARROWHEAD TO VISIT US IN THE IT'S YOU KNOW SINCE LIKE ARROWHEADS VERY CLOSE TO BIG BEAR IT'S IN THE SAME THIS. AND OUR THAT- YOU KNOW THAT HE TOOK THE TIME TO DO THAT- ALSO AS WAS MENTIONED THE BIPARTISAN DINNERS. THE TACO NIGHTS HEATHER MAKING THESE TACOS JUST. BAR NONE AMAZING AND ALL THE TIMES WE WERE ABLE TO SPEND OVER AT THEIR PLACE- ENJOYING TIME TOGETHER AND CAMARADERIE. REALLY BROUGHT US ALL TOGETHER SO YOU KNOW YOU'LL BE A GREAT ASSET TO CONGRESS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. BUT A BIG LOSS FOR US HERE IN THIS HOUSE AND I KNOW WE'LL KEEP IN TOUCH BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE. IT'S JUST AMAZING MEMBER AND THE GREAT INTEGRITY AND ABILITY SO- WE WISH YOU LUCK THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OBERNOLTE THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THE KIND WORDS AND THE NOT SO KIND WORDS I WANT YOU ALL TO KNOW THAT- SERVING AS A MEMBER OF THIS BODY AND SERVING WITH ALL OF YOU IS MY COLLEAGUES HAS BEEN ONE OF THE HIGH HONORS OF MY LIFE. WHEN I WAS FIRST ELECTED. TO THE ASSEMBLY SIX YEARS AGO. I TOOK SOME TIME AND MET WITH. DEPARTING MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE WHAT ADVICE THEY WOULD GIVE TO A NEOPHYTE FRESHMAN. AND MUCH TO MY SURPRISE. MOST OF THEM SAID THIS THEY SAID THE THING THAT I'M GOING TO MISS THE MOST. IS THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT I BUILT. WITH THE PEOPLE THAT I SERVE WITH. AND THAT REALLY WENT COUNTER TO MY EXPECTATIONS COMING INTO THE BODY I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY PARTISAN I THOUGHT IT WAS ERY POLITICAL I REALLY HADN'T GRASPED THIS IDEA. THAT YOU COULD BUILD PERSONAL FRIENDSHIPS AND RELATIONSHIPS. WITH SEVENTY NINE OTHER PEOPLE AND FORTY PEOPLE IN THE SENATE. BUT NOW AS I LOOK BACK ON MY TIME I THINK THEY WERE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT BECAUSE THAT'S THE THING THAT I AM GOING TO CHURCH THE MOST. IS MY FRIENDSHIPS AND MY RELATIONSHIPS WITH SOME AMAZING PEOPLE THAT I SERVE WITH. WHAT WHAT I WAS FIRST ELECTED. I REMEMBER FRESHMAN ORIENTATION WAS RUN BY RICH GORDON RIMMER RICH. AN AMAZING HUMAN BEING AN AMAZING FRIEND. AND. I REMEMBER THAT BEING ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF MY FIRST TERM AND SO WHEN HE TURNED OUT I SAID TO HIM RICH. THESE BIPARTISAN DINNERS YOU KNOW REALLY CHANGED MY TRAJECTORY OF THE LEGISLATURE IN- WE NEED TO KEEP DOING THEM SO LET ME KNOW WHO YOU ARE PICKING BECAUSE I WANT TO HELP. AND HE SAID WHAT J. NO ONE HAS STEPPED UP SO IT'S GOING TO BE YOU. AND I SAID RICH I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE NOTICED BUT I'M A REPUBLICAN. ANY SORT OF DOESN'T MATTER THEY'RE BIPARTISAN DINNERS AND SO FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS HEATHER AND I HAVE BEEN DOING THOSE AND- WHAT A BLESSING IT'S BEEN FOR US TO ACTUALLY SIT DOWN BREAK BREAD WITH PEOPLE. GET TO KNOW. COLLEAGUES ON A PERSONAL LEVEL KIND OF OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDING IN THE HUSTLE AND BUSTLE OF LEGISLATION- IT'S BEEN AMAZING AND SO I WANT TO CHALLENGE YOU SOMEBODY'S GONNA TAKE UP THAT MANTLE BECAUSE IT'S AN IMPORTANT PROGRAM. IT'S AN IMPORTANT EFFORT AND SOMEBODY NEEDS TO STEP UP AND DO IT SO. LET ME KNOW IF I CAN HELP. ANOTHER THING THAT HAS BEEN. REALLY UNEXPECTED AND AMAZING TO ME IS THAT SOME OF THE PEOPLE. THAT I BUILT THE CLOSEST FRIENDSHIPS AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH ON THIS FLOOR HAVE BEEN THE PEOPLE. I ACTUALLY FROM A POLICY STANDPOINT DISAGREE WITH THE MOST. AND AT FIRST IT SEEMED VERY ODD TO ME BUT IN RETROSPECT I THINK IT'S VERY NATURAL BECAUSE I THINK WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION. NOT ONLY IS LAWMAKERS BUT AS HUMAN BEINGS TO BROADEN OUR HORIZONS. TO SEEK OUT ALTERNATE OPINIONS AT THE FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS IN SOMEONE'S BACKGROUND THAT MAKES THEM HOLD. A VIEWPOINT THAT'S SO DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE THAT WE HOLD. BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT- THAT I TREASURE ABOUT THE FRIENDSHIPS I'VE BUILT HERE. IS THAT THERE'S ALWAYS A REASON. I MEAN WE ARE HERE. FOR THE SAME PURPOSE WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME TEAM WE PLAY FOR TEAM CALIFORNIA. AND WE ALL CARE PASSIONATELY ABOUT MAKING LIFE BETTER FOR THE PEOPLE THAT ELECTED US THE PEOPLE WE REPRESENT. SO IF WE DISAGREE ON SOMETHING IT'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING FUNDAMENTAL ABOUT UR BACKGROUND. AND WE ALL BRING. DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES AND DIFFERENT A DIFFERENT LIFE EXPERIENCE TO OUR SERVICE HERE. SO I'VE BEEN FASCINATED TO TALK TO PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT IT IS YOU KNOW I THINK THIS YOU THINK THAT OKAY I WANT TO KNOW WHY. YOU HOLD THAT VIEWPOINT SO PASSIONATELY. SO I WANT TO THANK YOU. ALL OF YOU FOR GIVING ME THAT EDUCATION. AND FOR GIVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET TO KNOW YOU- IT IS REALLY REALLY BAD ON ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF MY LIFE. AND I- SO BIG THANK YOUS FIRST OF ALL TO MY STAFF. WE ALL KNOW THAT WE COULDN'T DO WHAT WE DO HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE WITHOUT THE HELP OF OUR STAFF I'VE HAD AN AMAZING STAFF. BOTH HERE IN THE CAPITAL AND IN THE DISTRICT. I'VE BEEN BLESSED TO HAVE VERY LITTLE STAFF TURNOVER SO IT'S BEEN KIND OF A CONSTANT PRESENCE IN MY LIFE. AND SO I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR THE PEOPLE. THAT I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE TO WORK WITH I'M TOLD. THAT I'M NOT THE EASIEST PERSON TO WORK FOR. I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S TRUE FOR THE RECORD BUT- WITH I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE- THAT THEY'VE GIVEN ME SIX YEARS OF THEIR LIFE. I ALSO WANT TO SAY A BIG. THANK YOU TO MY FAMILY AND MY WIFE HEATHER. HAS BEEN. SHE'S BEEN JUST AMAZING WHEN THE BIG THE BIG FEARS THAT I HAD WHEN I WAS ELECTED IS THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO SACRAMENTO AND HAVE A LIFE APART FROM HER. AND SO WE KIND OF MADE A DEAL WHEN I GOT THROUGH THE PRIMARY THAT THAT SHE WOULD COME ONE WEEK A MONTH. UP TO SACRAMENTO WITH ME. BECAUSE IF I SAID. YOU KNOW THAT- ASSEMBLY MEN TAKEN I HAD. A LUNCH OF PIZZA ROCK WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MY DAY I WANT I WANT. TO KNOW WHO FILLERS ANO FOR TO KNOW WHERE PETE'S ARRAKIS. ADDED WANTED TO HAVE THAT LIFE APART FROM HER. AND SO SHE CAME UP HERE STARTED COMING UP ONE WEEK A MONTH AND HERE'S THE THING I REALLY DIDN'T FACTOR AND- EVERYONE LIKES HER BETTER THAN ME. SO BUT IT'S BEEN AMAZING TO HAVE HER WE WELCOMED UP HERE AND- TO SHARE THIS EXPERIENCE WITH HER AND I WANT TO SAY THE ALSO THANK YOU TO MY CHILDREN. MOST OF YOUR PARENTS AND HERE YOU KNOW WHAT A SACRIFICE IT IS FOR OUR FAMILIES FOR US TO BE HERE. FOUR DAYS A WEEK. EVERY SINGLE WEEK- I MISSED A LOT OF PARITY TO CONFERENCES MISSED A LOT OF SCHOOL EVENTS. MISSED A LOT OF PLAYS- MISSED A LOT OF SPORTING EVENTS. AND SO I AM VERY TARGETED THE FACT THAT. THEY ARE THE ONES THAT PAY THAT PART OF THE PRICE FOR MY PUBLIC SERVICE. AND ALSO WANT TO THANK A- I THANK RE THANK OUR LEADERSHIP BUT IT'S BEEN AMAZING TO BE IN CAUCUS LEADERSHIP FOR THE SIX YEARS THAT I'VE SERVEDHERE. AND I THINK IT OF OUR SPEAKER. A REALLY. CREATES A VERY BIPARTISAN ATMOSPHERE MAKES ALL OF US FEEL WELCOME. BOB AND IN CLOSING I WANT TO SAY. THAT THERE'S ONE MORE THING I'M THANKFUL FOR THE FIRST DAY THAT I WALK ON TO THIS FLOOR I WAS OVERCOME BY A SENSE OF AWE. WHEN I WALKED INTO THE CHAMBER IS THE FACT THAT WE GET TO SERVE. THE NEEDS OF FORTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS THAT THEY'RE ENTRUSTING US TO MAKE GOOD DECISIONS FOR THEM HERE I JUST I MEAN IT WAS I WAS UNBELIEVABLE BUT I WAS ACTUALLY. BEING ENTRUSTED TO PUSH THOSE BUTTONS. AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF THE ON THAT DAY SIX YEARS AGO. I HOPE I NEVER LOSE THE SENSE OF AWE. WHEN I WALK IN THIS CHAMBER BECAUSE IF I EVER CAN WALK INTO THE CHAMBER AND THINK WELL YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS MY ORDINARY LIFE- IT AND- I DIDN'T TAKE FOR GRANTED THE RESPONSIBILITY I HAVE WELL IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON. AND DO SOMETHING ELSE IN LIFE AND I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT THAT EVERY DAY SINCE THEN I'VE WALKED THROUGH THOSE DOORS. WITH A SENSE OF AWE AND WONDER. SO I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING MY FRIENDS MY COMPANIONS ON THIS JOURNEY- AND- AS YES MY COLLEAGUES TOLD ME SIX YEARS AGO. THE WIDELY WITH THE SENSE THAT THE THING THAT I'M GONNA MISS THE MOST IS ALL OF YOUR FRIENDSHIP- AND THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT I BUILT WITH ALL OF YOURSELF. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR OBERNOLTE AS WITH SAID WE WILL MISS YOUR INCREDIBLE QUESTIONS IN COMMITTEE. THAT TRULY MAKE POLICY BETTER FOR CALIFORNIA. MOVING TO ATTRIBUTE FOR MISTER GLORIA.

LEADING A TRIBUTE FOR MISMATCH IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER JACQUI IRWIN IS THERE WHEN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER SPEAKER AND- AS JAY MENTIONED EVERY YEAR OR- EVERY EVERY TWO YEARS AT THE END OF SESSION WE SAY GOODBYE TO OUR COLLEAGUES AND ONE OF THE OF THAT'S ONE OF THE HARDEST PARTS OF THE YEAR BECAUSE SO MUCH OF THIS JOB IS ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS AND- OF FIVE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER FOR A LONG TIME ALL REALLY MISS YOU OF. MS MON HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE COLLEAGUE ALSO. BUT I'M- HEARTBROKEN YOU BECAUSE YOU WERE HERE FOR SUCH A SHORT TIME AND- THERE WAS SUCH INCREDIBLE- ENERGY BEHIND EVERYTHING THAT YOU DID ALREADY. SO I AM RISING TO HONOR MY FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE- CHRISTY SMITH. NOT ONLY DID WE SIT AND ADJACENCIES BUT WE WERE IN ADJACENT DISTRICTS AND- JUST A FUN FACT ABOUT THE OF VENTURA COUNTY VENTURA COUNTY EIGHT OF THE NINE REPRESENTATIVES IN VENTURA COUNTY WOMEN. PROBABLY HIGHER PERCENTAGE THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE STATE AND UNFORTUNATELY- MS SMITH IS LEAVING AND- I'M NOT SURE WHO'S GONNA BE TAKING YOUR SPOT THERE BUT IT WAS- YOU WERE THE ONE THAT REALLY FOUGHT FOR THAT SEAT I MET CHRISTIE. WHEN SHE WAS RUNNING FOUR YEARS AGO FOR THE STATE ASSEMBLY AND I'VE NEVER MET ANYBODY THAT WAS MORE DETERMINED AND WORKED HARDER YOU ARE JUST AN INCREDIBLE DYNAMO YOU ARE A FIGHTER AND WHEN IT DIDN'T GO THE DIRECTION THAT WE WANTED TO GO IN THAT ELECTION FOR TWO MORE YEARS YOU FOUGHT TO GET THE SEAT. AND YOUR CONSTITUENTS ARE SO LUCKY THAT YOU REPRESENTED THEM FOR TWO YEARS. UNFORTUNATELY OF. I HEARD A CONGRESS PERSON RIZ. AND BRIGHT AWAY CRISTINA THAT SHE HAD TO STEP UP BECAUSE THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO REALLY HOLD ON TO THAT SEATS- DUTY CALLED. AND AFTER ALL THE EFFORT TO WIN THE ASSEMBLY C. YOU ARE RUNNING FOR CONGRESS. HE WAS ELECTED TO AN AREA THAT HAS VERY SIMILAR POLITICS TO THE POLITICS I HAVE AND WE OFTEN TO SIT HERE AND MOST OF YOU DON'T KNOW THIS BUT WE PLAY COMMERCIALS IN OUR HEAD. OR OUT LOUD ABOUT HOW YOUR BILLS ARE GOING TO BE RUNNING IN OUR DISTRICT. THE ATTACK ADS THAT ARE GOING TO BE COMING WE DO IT VERY SOFTLY SO WE DON'T OFFEND ANYBODY BUT- I REALLY AND ENJOYED THAT SHE'S WORKED INCREDIBLY HARD. TO REPRESENT HER DISTRICT AND TO BRING RESOURCES TO OUR DISTRICT. THAT SAID NOBODY ELSE EVER HAD SHE'S HIGHLY DEDICATED TO EDUCATIONAL ISSUES SHE SERVED ON THE- NEW HALL SCHOOL BOARD AND THE PTA. SHE FOUNDED THE VALENCIA VALLEY TECHNOLOGICAL EDUCATION FOUNDATION AND SERVED AS ITS FIRST CHAIR. BUT WHAT SHE'S REALLY SHE'S JUST REALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT IS MAKING SURE. THAT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE. WHEN YOU HEAR HER TALK ABOUT THE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT SHE WORKED WITH. THAT HELPED HER GET ELECTED. IT'S SOMETHING THAT I DON'T HEAR FROM VERY MANY OTHER PEOPLE ABOUT HOW WE MAKE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO SUCCEED AND SHE HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE MENTOR TO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE AS A MATTER OF FACT HER DISTRICT DIRECTOR. A VERY YOUNG MAN IS RUNNING FOR CITY COUNCIL IN SEAMY VALLEY AND ALAN. I KNOW THAT YOU REALLY PUSH HIM IN THAT DIRECTION. WHEN SHE CAME HERE SHE JUST HIT THE GROUND RUNNING AND PASSED SOME VERY VERY IMPORTANT LEGISLATION THAT TOOK A VERY LONG TIME HAS THIS LIMóN CAN ATTEST WITH THE BANKING LEGISLATION. NOBODY HAD REALLY BEEN ABLE TO GET THROUGH AND MAKE SOME OF THE CHANGES YOU DID BUT YOU REALLY USE YOUR EXPERIENCE TO GET THAT DONE YOU ARE BRIGHT. AND FUNNY AND YOU ARE REALLY GOING TO BE MISSED HERE I HAVE I'VE ENJOYED. YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF POLICY I'D LOVE pHOME WE GET HERE AND COMPARE NOTES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE THINKING THE SAME WAY. AND I'M REALLY I'M REALLY GOING TO MISS YOU BUT- I'M TO BE VISITING YOU IN DC AS I'M SURE MANY OF YOUR COLLEAGUES WHERE ALL WILL BE WHEN WERE LOBBYING YOU FOR CALIFORNIA. AND GOOD LUCK AND THANK YOU FOR ALL THE CONTRIBUTIONS YOU HAVE MADE TO THIS BODY. THANK YOU MISERABLE HIS DARK HAIR AND YOU ARE RECOGNIZED FOR YOUR TRIBUTE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBERS. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I AM SO HAPPY TO HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO RISE TODAY TO CELEBRATE THE SERVICE ASSEMBLY WOMAN CHRISTY SMITH. I WAS THINKING ABOUT THE SPEECH AND I WAS THINKING ABOUT HER CHRISTIE'S DEPARTURE NEARS HER TENURE HERE IN THIS HOUSE. EVERY DAY THE CHRISTIE CAME ON THIS FLOOR AND TOOK A VOTE AND SAT N FRONT OF HER COMMITTEE SHE ALWAYS ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT WHAT HER DISTRICT WANTED HER TO DO AND PUT HER COMMUNITY FIRST. THIS COMMUNITY THAT SHE KNOWS SO DEEPLY HAVING LIVED THERE FOR DECADES RAISING HER GIRLS THERE AND SERVING ON THEIR LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD. AND SO WHEN THE CALL CAME. THAT THEY NEEDED HER TO RUN FOR OFFICE IN WASHINGTON. SHE PUT COUNTRY OVER SELF AND DECIDED TO RUN FOR THAT OFFICE. AND AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHEN SAID IT'S TOO SOON WE'RE NOT READY TO LOSE YOU CHRISTY. BUT WE'RE SO GRATEFUL FOR ALL THAT YOU HAVE DONE HERE ON THE SCREEN CARPET IN IN THIS BUILDING. CHRISTINE I MET ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. SHE A WIZENED SECOND TIME CANDIDATES IN ME AS GREEN AS THEY COME TRYING TO FIGURE IT ALL OUT. AND THEN SINCE OUR TEAMS HAD TO SIT IN THE BASEMENT TO REGISTER AS VOTERS FOR WEEKS BEFORE VICTORIES WERE DECLARED. WE WENT THROUGH FRESHMAN ORIENTATION JUST THE TWO OF US. NOW I QUICKLY LEARNED THAT IF YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH FRESHMAN ORIENTATION WITH JUST ONE OTHER PERSON CHRISTY IS THE PERSON YOU WANT IN THE ROOM. QUIET SELF ASSURED WAYS MAKE FOR THE PERFECT ORIENTATION PARTNER. QUESTIONS WERE ON POINT CLICK AND THERE WEREN'T TOO MANY OF THEM. WE BECAME FAST FRIENDS PICKING OUR CHIEF TOGETHER THAT WEEK CELEBRATING MILESTONES IN OUR OFFICES AND FIGHTING FOR THE LEGISLATION AND IS- ASSEMBLY MEMBER LIMON SAID TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THESE HARD BILLS THROUGH THIS BUILDING. YOU HAVE ACCOMPLISHED MORE IN YOUR TWO YEARS HERE THAN MOST CONGRESS PEOPLE HAVE IN A DECADE. YOU PASSED BILLS PROTECTING OUR STUDENTS FROM SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND EXPANDING THEIR ACCESS TO RESOURCES. YOU WROTE POLICY THAT WILL HOLD CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOLS ACCOUNTABLE AND EXPANDED RESOURCES FOR INJURED CHILDREN. YOU ENSURING HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS RECEIVE THEIR JUST COMPENSATION AND INDIVIDUALS THE RISK OF LOSING THEIR HOMES CAN STAY HOUSE. YOU STOOD UP FOR YOUR VALUES AT EVERY TURN MAKING SURE YOU PROTECTED THE BUDGETS OF OUR STATE AND OUR COMMUNITY. AND IF THAT ALL WASN'T ENOUGH IN HER VERY SHORT TWO YEARS HERE SHE ALSO DELIVERED SO MUCH FOR HER DISTRICT FUNDING AN UPDATE TO A LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE A FREE CLINIC IN SEAMY VALLEY HELPING A SENIOR CENTER. AND ESTABLISHING A CHILD CARE CENTER AT CSU CHANNEL ISLANDS KNOWING THAT THIS WILL GET MORE WOMEN TO GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE. THE FIGHT FOR WOMEN'S EQUITY IS ALWAYS TOP OF MIND FOR CHRISTY. IN FACT YOU MAY NOT KNOW THAT SHE IS THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN. NOT ASSEMBLY MEMBER. AND SHE EXPLAINED TO ME THAT SHE WANTS TO BE CALLED ASSEMBLY WOMAN BECAUSE- IF YOU LOOK AROUND THERE AREN'T AS MANY OF US AS THERE ARE SIMPLY MEANT. AND SO ONCE WE'RE EQUAL WE CAN ALL THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS BUT UNTIL THEN SHE'S AN ASSEMBLYWOMAN. YOU FINISH A TROOPS GIRL. AND THEN YOU SIR YOUR CAN. AND YOU WILL CONTINUE. TO SERVE YOUR COMMUNITY IN VALUABLE WAYS AND WE- KNOW THAT. FOR WOMEN OF HOW. AND NOW THE GREAT. CHRIS I WILL MISS NOT ONLY ARE. BUT YOUR GUIDANCE ON THINGS. I MEAN STILL CALL YOU BE WARNED- AND YOUR QUICK WIT. MANY PEOPLE IN THIS FOR MAKING BE AS QUIET BUT THEY JUST HAVEN'T HEARD IT. I KNOW THAT YOU. ALL OF US WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. WE WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK WE WILL MISS YOU SO. AND WE KNOW WE'LL SEE YOU BACK HERE LEADING SACRAMENTO SUNDAY. THANK YOU SOMEONE ABOUT. ASSEMBLY WOMAN SMITH. YOU LIKE TO MAKE SOME COMMON. THANK YOU ALL- I ECHO THE SENTIMENTS OF MY FELLOW COLLEAGUES WHO FIND THEMSELVES OF DEPARTING BUT WITH WITH ONE CAVEAT- I DID NOT ANTICIPATE MY ASSEMBLY EULOGY TO COME SO SOON- BUT THE INTERNET LIKE POLITICS CAN BE A REALLY CRAZY WILD RIDE. AND SO HERE I AM BUT IT HAS BEEN THE PRIVILEGE OF A LIFETIME. TO SERVE NOT ONLY MY CONSTITUENTS FORTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS BUT TO SERVE WITH EACH OF YOU. WHO BRINGS WITH YOU YOUR OWN UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE DEVELOPED FROM YOUR DISTRICT FROM YOUR SERVICE. IN PRIOR BODIES FROM THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE THAT BROUGHT YOU ALL TO THIS PLACE SO THAT WE CAN ALL WORK TOGETHER ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIANS. I HAVE LEARNED SOME AAZING THINGS WITH YOU I HAVE SEEN ACTS OF POLITICAL HEROISM AND DETERMINATION THAT ASTONISHED ME. FROM OUR COLLEAGUE IN SAN DIEGO- WITH HER LANDMARK BILL TO COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE MOVED FROM PERHAPS ONE POLITICAL PERSPECTIVE. TO ANOTHER AND SOME OF YOU WHO HAVE FOUGHT DILIGENTLY FOR ISSUES THAT BROUGHT YOU HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND MAYBE YOUR FIGHT ISN'T FINISHED YET BUT YOU CONTINUE. I'VE LEARNED A FEW IMPORTANT THINGS. ONE APPRECIATE YOUR STAFF BECAUSE LITERALLY WE CAN'T DO THIS WORK WITHOUT THEM SOMETIMES WHERE THE IDEA AND THERE THE EXECUTION. SO I WOULD SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH VERY DEEPLY TO MY ENTIRE STAFF MY SACRAMENTO TEAM MY DISTRICT TEAM. MY SACRAMENTO TEAM WILL BE LOOKING FOR HOMES AND THEY ARE ALL WONDERFUL AMAZING TALENTED GIFTED PEOPLE PLEASE TAKE IN. IF YOU HAVE AROUND. MY DISTRICT TEAM HAS BEEN PHENOMENAL IN PART OF OUR SUCCESS WAS JUST BEING IN THE COMMUNITY BEING ACCESSIBLE LITERALLY BEING AT EVERYTHING IF THERE WAS A RIBBON CUTTING FOR A DOG GROOMERS WE WERE THERE THERE WAS A CHAMBER MEETING WE WERE THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD COUNCILS. WE WERE THERE. THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS SERVICE SHOULD BE ABOUT. IT IS EQUAL PARTS WHAT WE DO HERE IN THIS ROOM ON BEHALF OF ALL. BUT WHAT WE SERVE. TO OUR COMMUNITY. CAN BE SO MUCH MORE MEANINGFUL. SOFTENS THAT OUR GREATEST FEAR OF INFLUENCES THOSE IMMEDIATELY AROUND US AND I LEARN FROM ALL OF YOU TO EMBRACE THAT ROLE AS WELL AND DIVE RIGHT IN. I LEARNED NEVER TO TAKE A VOTE YOU CAN'T DEFEND. SO I NEVER WALKED OFF THIS FLOOR NOT THINKING IN MY HEAD THERE'S GOING TO BE A REPORTER OUTSIDE THE DOOR ASKING ME WHY. AND I DEVELOPED THAT. BEFORE I TOOK EVERY SINGLE VOTE. AND SOME OF YOU WERE VERY HELPFUL. IN YOUR WORDS IN YOUR GUIDANCE IN YOUR INSPIRATION IN YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT. YOUR BILL MEANT WHAT SOMEONE ELSE'S BILL MEANT WHAT THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES MIGHT BE WHAT THE REAL COSTS. MIGHT BE. AND HOW WE COULD ALL WORK TO LEAVE THIS ROOM. KNOWING THAT WE HAD TAKEN ABOUT WE ARE PROUD OF. I LEARNED A RIGHT BILLS. AND ADVOCATE FOR BILLS. THAT I WAS PROUD OF. WHERE THE WORK WAS MEANINGFUL. AND ALTHOUGH I'VE BEEN HERE A SHORT TIME I AM PROUD OF EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THAT I PUT FORWARD AND WAS PRIVILEGED TO HAVE SIGNED. BUT I ALSO LEARNED. NOT TO WASTE MY TIME. AT THE MICROPHONE. AND I'VE STRUGGLED OVER THIS MOMENT OVER WHAT TO SAY TO NOT HAVE IT BE TRITE. AND TO HAVE IT BE MEANINGFUL. BUT WHAT I HAVE LEARNED. MOST FROM THIS BRAND AND WHY EXPERIENCE THAT I AM SO PROUD OF IS THAT IN CALIFORNIA IN DO THINGS WELL AND IT MADE IT SO EASY FOR ME TO REPRESENT MY SERVICE WHEN I WAS OUT IN THE COMMUNITY. WE HAVE BEEN THE NATION'S LEADERS ON CLIMATE CHANGE NOW WE'RE GETTING THERE ON HOUSING AND PROTECTING OUR COAST ON PROTECTING WORKERS. IN THIS STATE WE DO GOVERNMENT WELL WE HAVE A RAINY DAY FUND WE DO BI PARTISANSHIP WELL HERE. AND THAT'S A LESSON NOW THAT NEEDS TO BE CARRIED FORTH TO THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. SO I WAS PRIVILEGED TO COME INTO A SYSTEM THAT WAS ALREADY WORKING YOU GUYS WERE ALREADY PROOF OF CONCEPT. THAT WE COULD DO THIS AND THAT CALIFORNIA HAS LED THE WAY. BUT NOW CALIFORNIA HAS ONE MORE GREAT CHALLENGE. AS WE SEE THIS COUNTRY PARTICULARLY IN THIS POLITICAL CYCLE NEARLY TORN ASUNDER BY THE POLITICS OF OTHER ISM. END OF FEAR. IT HAS TO BE CALIFORNIA THAT STANDS UP AND SAYS WE KNOW HOW TO DO THIS OUR CITIES OUR SUBURBS ARE NEIGHBORHOODS LOOK LIKE WHAT THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY WILL BE. RACIALLY RELIGIOUSLY ECONOMICALLY DIVERSE. YET WE KNOW HOW TO GOVERN AND CREATE SYSTEMS TO PROVIDE EQUITY. IN SUPPORT AND CARING AND COMPASSION YES WE HAVE MORE WORK HERE TO DO IN CALIFORNIA STILL. BUT WE HAVE BEEN AND WE MUST CONTINUE TO BE. THE BEACON OF LIGHT ON ALL OF THOSE IMPORTANT ISSUES THIS COUNTRY IS DEPENDING ON THAT. TO BE PROUD OF THE WORK THAT WE CONTINUE TO DO. IN SUPPORTING EVERY PEOPLE. REGARDLESS OF INCOME. SKIN COLOR. IMMIGRATION STATUS EMPLOYMENT STATUS HOUSING STATUS. WE KNOW HOW TO DO THAT WORK BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT CALIFORNIA LOOKS LIKE THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WE ALREADY SERVE WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO DO IT WITH PRIDE. AND LEAD THE WAY. SO IT HAS BEEN A PRIVILEGE TO DO THAT WORK WITH YOU FOR SUCH A SHORT TIME. BUT WHEN I'M SUCCESSFUL IN NOVEMBER MY DOORS- OPEN AND LET'S CONTINUE TO DO GREAT THINGS THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY. WOMAN SET YOUR COMMENTS. MEMBERS WE WILL NOW MOVE TO ATTRIBUTE FOR MISTER KANSEN CHU. WE WILL BEGIN WITH MISS GONZALES GONZALES ARE RECOGNIZED. I CAN'T SEND YOU KNOW I WAS THE- HONORED MOST SURPRISED WHEN I GOT THE CALL TO ASK IF I WOULD DO YOUR TRIBUTE. AND THEN I REALIZED IT WAS REALLY BECAUSE A DAISY NOT HERE RIGHT. SO FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T I'M JOKING OF COURSE THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW KANSEN IS BETTER HALF- I'VE HAD SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY TO NOT ONLY GET TO KNOW KANSEN BUT- HIS STRONG. BRILLIANT WIFE WHO- IT'S I DON'T THINK OF ANY OTHER SPOUSE THAT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET TO KNOW IN THAT WAY AND I REALLY APPRECIATED. KNOWING BOTH OF THEM. I AS SUPPORTING KANSEN BEFORE I KNEW HIM. THERE WERE TWO DEMOCRATS RUNNING YOU USUALLY TRY TO STAY OUT OF THAT. BUT HE HAD SUCH GLOWING REVIEWS FROM PEOPLE WHO HAD WORKED WITH HIM FOR SO LONG. PEOPLE IN SAN JOSE IN THE LABOR COMMUNITY PEOPLE IT SERVED ON THE CITY COUNCIL WITH HIM. AND THEY JUST SAID. KANSEN IS A STAND UP GUY HE IS A GUY WHO WILL GIVE YOU HIS WORD AND BE THERE. HE'S THE KIND OF GUY YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK TWICE. AND SAY ARE YOU SURE. I THINK IN THIS. IN THIS HOUSE AND IN POLITICS IN GENERAL THAT'S AN INCREDIBLE INCREDIBLE. ALREADY TO HAVE SOMEONE WHO YOU'RE NOT CHECKING BACK WITH YOU JUST KNOW KANSEN SOLID. AND WHEN HE GOT HERE PROVED TO BE TRUE. RIGHT AWAY- WE ACTUALLY DIDN'T SERVE ON THE LABOUR COMMITTEE BUT SOMEBODY MIGHT BILLS WENT THROUGH THERE AND I CHECK IN WITH KANSEN HE'S A I'M FINE. AND HE'D BE FINE NEVER HAVE TO CHECK AGAIN. BUT THEN ONE DAY I HAD A BILL ON THE FLOOR THAT IS. VOTED ON HE'D BEEN FINE HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN BEEN A CO AUTHOR ON. IT WAS TOUGH IT WAS STUCK I WAS TAKING MEASUREMENTS AND TAKING AMENDMENTS TO TRY TO GET IT WHERE IT WAS. SO THEN I WENT BACK AND I THINK I HAVE THE VOTES. WE SAT OVER THERE AT THE TIME AND KANSEN WALKED UP TO ME AND I'VE JUST GOTTEN TO FORTY ONE AND WE'RE ABOUT TO TAKE A BACK UP OFF CALL. AND HE SAID OH I CAN'T VOTE FOR YOUR BILL. AND I. WHAT KANSEN YOUR VOTED FOR LIKE WHAT ARE YOU TALKING I TOOK ALL THESE AMENDMENTS IT'S ACTUALLY EASIER TO VOTE FOR THAT NOW YOU TOOK TO ME AMENDMENTS IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING ANYMORE I'M NOT GONNA VOTE FOR YOUR BILL. IN I LOOKED AT HIM I START LAUGHING HE'S LIKE NOW NOW. AND THEN I WAS LIKE OH MY GOSH I DON'T HAVE FORTY ONE BILLS AND THEN OF COURSE HE STARTS LAUGHING HE THOUGHT THAT WAS THE BEST JOKE EVER. GREATEST JOKE. FROM THAT DAY ON EVERY DAY I HAD ASKED KANSEN ARE YOU TELL ME THE TRUTH BECAUSE LIKE I CAN'T SPELL. BUT I SAW HIM GROW AS A LEGISLATOR AS WELL AND- THIS MAY SOUND PETTY BUT FROM THE DAY I WAS ELECTED I REALLY WANTED TO DO A TIME CHANGE BILL. AS APPEARANCE I HATE TIME CHANGE IN MY STAFF WOULDN'T LET ME DO IT. THEY JUST SAID NO YOU YOU KNOW. IT'S TOO BIG THERE'S TOO MANY MOVING PARTS YOU CAN'T CHANGE DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME AND THEN ONE DAY OUT OF THE BLUE KANSEN ANNOUNCES HE'S GOING TO TRY TO TAKE ON DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME VERSUS. THE TIME CHANGE. SIZE A LITTLE JEALOUS AND I WENT TO CAMP ANYTHING YOU CAN BE MY CO AUTHOR. OKAY GOOD WE'RE GONNA DO THIS PROPOSITION WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH ITS STILL WAITING DON'T WORRY I'LL I'LL BRING IT UP NEXT YEAR AGAIN- BUT- KANSEN. ME SAYS I HAVE. A MEDIA.

TIFFANY WANTED TO HELP THE WORLD BY BECOMING PRESIDENT SOME DAY NO I KNEW THIS CHILD AND BELIEVE ME WHEN I TELL YOU THAT THIS CHILD HAD A LIGHT AROUND HER. THAT IS RARE IN THIS WORLD. ONE DAY IN PARTICULAR I WAS AT THE PLAYGROUND WITH MY DAUGHTER WHO WAS MAYBE FOUR YEARS YOUNGER THAN TIFFANY. NOW MOST OF THE TIME BIG KIDS DON'T REALLY WANT TO PLAY. WITH TODDLERS. BUT TIFFANY SAW THAT RACHEL WAS ALONE. AND SPENT THE ENTIRE TIME AT THE PLAYGROUND. PLAYING WITH HER PLAYING LITTLE KID GAMES WITH HER. AND THEN AFTERWARDS ASKED ME IF SHE COULD BABYSIT SHE EVEN CAME OVER TO ME AND TOLD ME WHEN SHE FELT RACHEL. WAS FEELING SAD. SHE WAS TRULY A GLOWING PERSON AND WHEN I HEARD ABOUT HER VERY UNTIMELY. DEMISE I CAN TELL YOU THAT I CRIED AND I WAS TRULY SHOCKED.

REMINDED ME OF A MOVIE LIKE A MIRACLE ON THIRTY FOURTH STREET. ONE OF THESE HOLLYWOOD MOVIES WHERE SOMEONE SAYS LET'S GO PUT ON A SHOW WELL SHE MADE IT HAPPEN BY FORCE OF NATURE AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT FILM FESTIVAL BECAME A MECCA. FOR ASPIRING YOUNG FILMMAKERS FROM ACROSS THE REGION. WHO COULDN'T GET INTO THE MORE ESTABLISHED FESTIVALS LIKE SLAMDANCE AND SUNDANCE. SHE MADE A TRULY COOPERATIVE WITH THE FILMMAKERS CONTROL THEIR DESTINY AND TO SEE THEIR JOY OF WATCHING THEIR FILMS BEING. PUT ON A BIG SCREEN WHICH SHE WAS ABLE TO DO.
