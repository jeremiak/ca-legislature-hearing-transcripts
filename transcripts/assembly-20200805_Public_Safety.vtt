00:57:38.121 --> 00:57:42.091
OUTED OUT OVER FIVE THOUSAND-

00:57:42.158 --> 00:57:43.593
WELL OVER FIVE THOUSAND CRIMES

00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:45.128
THERE WERE ABOUT EIGHT THAT

00:57:45.195 --> 00:57:47.564
WERE EXCLUDED FROM- DIVERSION

00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:51.701
CONSIDERATION IN AB TWENTY ONE

TWENTY FOUR AB THIRTY TWO FOUR

DOESN'T. CONTAIN THOSE

00:57:55.071 --> 00:57:59.008
EXCLUSIONS- FOR THE REASON THAT

00:57:59.075 --> 00:58:01.511
EVEN THOUGH IT IS UNLIKELY THAT

00:58:01.578 --> 00:58:04.614
A JUDGE WOULD EXTEND DIVERSION

00:58:04.681 --> 00:58:06.316
IN SOME OF THOSE. EIGHT TYPES

00:58:06.382 --> 00:58:09.118
OF CASES CASES THAT INVOLVED A

00:58:09.185 --> 00:58:11.387
SEXUAL OFFENDER REGISTRATION

00:58:11.454 --> 00:58:13.756
PURSUANT TO. EIGHTY TO NINETY

00:58:13.823 --> 00:58:14.824
EIGHT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THIRTY

00:58:14.891 --> 00:58:17.360
WHY DEADLY OR DANGEROUS WEAPON

00:58:17.427 --> 00:58:19.662
ON IT IS POSSIBLE THAT

00:58:19.729 --> 00:58:20.797
INTERSTATE WITH FORTY MILLION

00:58:20.864 --> 00:58:23.233
PEOPLE UNIQUE CASES COLORIZED

00:58:23.299 --> 00:58:25.501
THERE WAS ONE PUBLISHED CASE-

00:58:25.568 --> 00:58:31.708
THEY CAME OUT OF. L. A. COUNTY

00:58:31.774 --> 00:58:33.209
TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN IN WHICH I

00:58:33.276 --> 00:58:34.344
PERSONALLY GRANTED DIVERSION IN

00:58:34.410 --> 00:58:36.045
A DEADLY OR DANGEROUS WEAPON

00:58:36.112 --> 00:58:38.181
CASE AND THAT WAS EXCLUDED AND

00:58:38.248 --> 00:58:41.050
I WAS REVERSED AND- I THINK IT

00:58:41.117 --> 00:58:43.019
ILLUSTRATES THE PROPRIETY OF

00:58:43.086 --> 00:58:44.821
NOT HAVING EXCLUSION THAT WAS

00:58:44.888 --> 00:58:46.856
THE CASE. INVOLVED A FORTY

00:58:46.923 --> 00:58:48.291
THREE YEAR OLD. WITH NO

00:58:48.358 --> 00:58:49.726
CRIMINAL RECORD WHO GOT PULLED

00:58:49.792 --> 00:58:52.028
OVER ON A ROUTINE TRAFFIC STOP

00:58:52.095 --> 00:58:53.263
IN IN THE TRUNK OF HIS CAR HE

00:58:53.329 --> 00:58:56.766
HAD NOT. HE SAID THE NINE

00:58:56.833 --> 00:58:57.767
CHECKS BELONG TO EIGHTEEN OLD

00:58:57.834 --> 00:59:00.036
SON IT WAS UNCLEAR. I TO WHOM

00:59:00.103 --> 00:59:01.905
THEY BELONGED I THOUGHT THAT

00:59:01.971 --> 00:59:06.576
WAS AN APPROPRIATE CASE TO. GET

00:59:06.643 --> 00:59:09.412
OFFER DIVERSION- BUT BECAUSE

00:59:09.479 --> 00:59:10.613
THAT WAS CONSIDERED A DEADLY OR

00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:13.383
DANGEROUS WEAPON IT WAS MY

00:59:13.449 --> 00:59:14.717
DECISION WAS REVERSED. I THINK

00:59:14.784 --> 00:59:19.789
THAT IT HIGHLIGHTS THEIR IN-SUCH A HUGE STATE IT'S

00:59:19.856 --> 00:59:22.058
IMPOSSIBLE TO ALWAYS ANTICIPATE

00:59:22.125 --> 00:59:23.927
WHAT CASES MIGHT COME UP AND

00:59:23.993 --> 00:59:25.662
INSTEAD I THINK IT'S SAFE TO

00:59:25.728 --> 00:59:27.397
TRUST THE DISCRETION OF JUDGES

00:59:27.463 --> 00:59:30.033
TO- APPLY TO VERSION ONE

00:59:30.099 --> 00:59:34.837
APPROPRIATE. YOU REMOTE

PROTECTED- THERE WAS A STUDY

00:59:53.089 --> 00:59:54.724
ACTUALLY THAT CAME OUT THAT

00:59:54.791 --> 00:59:56.492
THAT CALIFORNIA'S OWNERS MEANT

00:59:56.559 --> 00:59:58.127
BY CALIFORNIA'S OWN ASSESSMENT

00:59:58.194 --> 01:00:03.199
ABOUT 50% OF OUR INCARCERATED I.

01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:08.671
AT VERY LOW RISK OF RECIDIVISM

01:00:08.738 --> 01:00:12.575
OF ANY KIND- AND MOST OF THE

01:00:12.642 --> 01:00:16.212
FOLKS IN THAT STUDY ARE

01:00:16.279 --> 01:00:18.848
ELDERLY. I'M EVEN MIDDLE AGED

AGED OUT OF CRIME AND I DO

01:00:23.486 --> 01:00:25.188

REPORT THAT CAME OUT THAT SET.

01:00:28.124 --> 01:00:32.495
FOR WHO ARE SENIOR. THERE'S

01:00:32.562 --> 01:00:33.696
ACTUALLY LESS THAN A TEN PERSON

01:00:33.763 --> 01:00:37.433
CHANCE OF RECIDIVISM I. ALSO

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:40.069

MISTER CHAIR FOR FIRST LET ME

01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:19.909
JUST AGAIN. REITERATE THAT THIS

01:01:19.976 --> 01:01:21.611
IS A PROPOSAL FOR JUDICIAL

01:01:21.677 --> 01:01:24.347
DISCRETION AROUND MISDEMEANOR

01:01:24.414 --> 01:01:26.516
DIVERSION IT IS NOT A

01:01:26.582 --> 01:01:28.818
AUTOMATIC. DIVERSION PROGRAM IT

01:01:28.885 --> 01:01:30.787
IS NOT A PRESCRIPTIVE DIVERSION

01:01:30.853 --> 01:01:33.222
PROGRAM- I THINK JUDGE LOW

01:01:33.289 --> 01:01:37.360
FALLS EXAMPLES EXCELLENT- THE

01:01:37.427 --> 01:01:41.264
NUMB TRUCK INCIDENT IS VERY-

01:01:41.330 --> 01:01:41.764
VERY COMICAL BECAUSE THE

01:01:41.831 --> 01:01:44.600
BECAUSE- COULD HAVE BEEN AFTER

01:01:44.667 --> 01:01:47.270
CARRYING. PROP FORGOT TO

01:01:47.336 --> 01:01:49.605
RESIDENTS A DEAD WEAPON I THINK

01:01:49.672 --> 01:01:52.575
IT IS. THAT CALIFORNIA AND I

01:01:52.642 --> 01:01:53.810
KNOW I NOTED THAT BECAUSE ABOUT

01:01:53.876 --> 01:01:55.945
BELIEVE ARIZONA JUST RECENTLY-

01:01:56.012 --> 01:01:58.481
LABELED NUN CHUCKS NOT A DEADLY

01:01:58.548 --> 01:02:00.817
WEAPON I THINK IT IS ON THAT

01:02:00.883 --> 01:02:04.020
CALIFORNIA STILL LABELS NUMBER

01:02:04.087 --> 01:02:07.356
DALY RIGHT. I'M I THINK UNDER

01:02:07.423 --> 01:02:08.257
THE RIGHT BUDGET OFTEN THAT

01:02:08.324 --> 01:02:12.161
PARTICULAR. THE CITY. FROM IN

01:02:12.228 --> 01:02:13.830
TERMS OF ELDERLY PAROLE AGAIN

01:02:13.896 --> 01:02:16.299
IT IS JUST INCREASING THE POOL

01:02:16.365 --> 01:02:18.334
OF PEOPLE WHO COULD GO BEFORE

01:02:18.401 --> 01:02:20.770
THE PAROLE BOARD DOES NOT

01:02:20.837 --> 01:02:24.240
PRESCRIBE PAROLE IT DOES NOT

01:02:24.307 --> 01:02:24.841
TELL THE PAROLE BOARD. AFTER

01:02:24.907 --> 01:02:27.844
THESE VIGILS AS- PART MAKE UP

01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:30.146
OF THE PAROLE BOARD IT IS VERY

01:02:30.213 --> 01:02:32.148
DIFFICULT TO GET PAROLE IN THE

01:02:32.215 --> 01:02:34.383
STATE OF CALIFORNIA EVEN AS WE

01:02:34.450 --> 01:02:37.286
INCREASE THE POOL. IN ADDITION

01:02:37.353 --> 01:02:40.289
MAKES A COMPLETE FISCAL SENSE

01:02:40.356 --> 01:02:42.425
TO GO BROACH BECAUSE WITH THE

01:02:42.492 --> 01:02:45.428
ELDERLY POOR- YOU KNOW WALL ON

01:02:45.495 --> 01:02:48.698
AVERAGE WHAT WE SPEND ABOUT A

01:02:48.764 --> 01:02:52.735
THOUSAND DOLLARS PER INTO. OF

01:02:52.802 --> 01:02:56.672
FOR. TO REACH INTO. IT IS UP OF

01:02:56.739 --> 01:02:57.473
TO THE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR

01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:58.107
FOR ELDERLY PERSONS BECAUSE THE

01:02:58.174 --> 01:03:00.243
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN

01:03:00.309 --> 01:03:01.777
HEALTHCARE COSTS AND DR CORPUS

01:03:01.844 --> 01:03:04.547
ACTUALLY RIGHT THAT A FIFTY

01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:08.151
YEAR OLD WHO'S BEEN IMPRISONED

01:03:08.217 --> 01:03:10.586
FOR TWENTY YEARS. NOT HAVE THE

02:18:42.047 --> 02:18:44.516

EXCLUDED OFFENSES. IF YOU'RE IN

02:18:51.556 --> 02:18:53.191
CUSTODY IT DOESN'T APPLY. TO

02:18:53.258 --> 02:18:55.393
THE I THINK THAT WHEN YOU LOOK

AT IT IN TOTALITY ENTERTAINS OF

02:18:57.529 --> 02:18:59.431
HOW IT OPERATES. I THINK IT

02:18:59.497 --> 02:19:01.566
MAKES SENSE- BECAUSE WE TRY TO

02:19:01.633 --> 02:19:04.469

02:19:07.305 --> 02:19:08.973
OTHERS. PRESSTITUTE THE LIKE

02:19:09.040 --> 02:19:11.776
THOSE THINGS CAN BE TAKEN CARE

02:19:11.843 --> 02:19:17.015
OF THE- DISTRICT ATTORNEY

02:19:17.082 --> 02:19:19.884

02:19:28.293 --> 02:19:32.363

02:26:37.555 --> 02:26:39.957
VIRUS. BUT I WOULD ACTUALLY

02:26:40.024 --> 02:26:41.993
ARGUE THAT THIS IS SOMETHING

02:26:42.059 --> 02:26:43.327
THAT WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN

02:26:43.394 --> 02:26:45.530
LOOKING AT EVEN BEFORE THE- I

02:26:45.596 --> 02:26:49.300
KNOW. ABOUT IN BELL IN- YOUR

02:26:49.367 --> 02:26:51.269
STATEMENTS. THAT THIS WILL HELP

02:26:51.335 --> 02:26:53.504
ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE BACKLOG

02:26:53.571 --> 02:26:55.106
THAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR COURTS

02:26:55.173 --> 02:26:58.109
AS ROADS ARE TO AS A RESULT OF

02:26:58.176 --> 02:27:01.479
THE PANDEMIC. BUT I ALSO THINK

02:27:01.546 --> 02:27:05.349
IT'S RESTING PLUGGING OF POOR.

02:27:05.416 --> 02:27:06.551
THE REST OF THE DAY MAY BE

02:27:06.617 --> 02:27:08.886
BECAUSE OF HOW WE USE THE

02:27:08.953 --> 02:27:11.956
COURTS AT OPPORTUNITY IN A

02:27:12.023 --> 02:27:18.095
SENSE TO KIND OF. TRY. I

02:27:18.162 --> 02:27:21.799
NECESSARY. STOPPABLE CHARGES

02:27:21.866 --> 02:27:24.202
USING THE SYSTEM TO FIGURE OUT

02:27:24.268 --> 02:27:26.971
ALL OF THE DIFFERENT MOVERS

02:27:27.038 --> 02:27:30.374
THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED TO

02:27:30.441 --> 02:27:31.509
EIGHT HAVE MORE WILL GO TO

02:27:31.576 --> 02:27:33.778
COURT SINCE WE RECOGNIZE THAT

02:27:33.844 --> 02:27:34.779
IT'S PLOY. AND REVENUE

02:27:34.845 --> 02:27:37.215
GENERATING SYSTEM AND ALSO TO

02:27:37.281 --> 02:27:39.317
GIVE IN MY OPINION AND I KNOW

02:27:39.383 --> 02:27:41.085
THIS IS BIASED DISTRICT

02:27:41.152 --> 02:27:44.288
ATTORNEYS NUMEROUS BITES AT THE

02:27:44.355 --> 02:27:46.757
APPLE WHEN IT'S ABOUT TRYING TO

02:27:46.824 --> 02:27:50.194
CHARGE AND PROSECUTE- WELL I

02:27:50.261 --> 02:27:54.532
ACTUALLY THINK THAT THIS IS. A

02:27:54.599 --> 02:27:57.101
GOOD. OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO FIX

02:27:57.168 --> 02:27:59.270
OUT HOW WE CAN CREATE GREATER

02:27:59.337 --> 02:28:03.207
EFFICIENCY IN COURT SYSTEM. I

02:28:03.274 --> 02:28:06.978
HAVE BEEN WITH NEW PEOPLE WHO

02:28:07.044 --> 02:28:09.347
ARM THEMSELVES IN THE CAR

02:28:09.413 --> 02:28:12.950
EVERYTHING DAY AND HAVE ALSO

02:28:13.017 --> 02:28:15.152
HAD TO DURING THE PANDEMIC.

02:28:15.219 --> 02:28:20.625
THEY TAUGHT ABOUT. THREE THESE

02:28:20.691 --> 02:28:22.560
ARE THE FIRST HAS BEEN A LIMB

02:28:22.627 --> 02:28:23.661
FROM THE PROCESS THESE THEY'RE

02:28:23.728 --> 02:28:27.531
INVOLVED IN BAILIFFS CLERKS

02:28:27.598 --> 02:28:30.534
JUDGES DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND

02:28:30.601 --> 02:28:33.504
DEFENSE COUNSEL ARE READING

02:28:33.571 --> 02:28:36.841
WHAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE-

02:28:36.907 --> 02:28:38.876
DELIVERING ARE MUCH MORE. THIRD

02:28:38.943 --> 02:28:41.946
BECAUSE NOT TIME BASED BECAUSE

02:28:42.013 --> 02:28:44.649
LIVES ARE AT STAKE AND IT'S

02:28:44.715 --> 02:28:47.084
AMAZING THAT THIS KIND NATIONAL

02:28:47.151 --> 02:28:50.254
PANDEMIC HAS BEEN NOTHING TO

02:28:50.321 --> 02:28:54.058
ENCOURAGE THE COURTS TO GET

02:28:54.125 --> 02:28:57.128
MORE OF FICTION AND THOUGHTFUL

02:28:57.194 --> 02:28:59.797
ABOUT HOW THE SYSTEM IS USED I

02:28:59.864 --> 02:29:02.300
THINK BECAUSE THEY WANT TO PUT

02:29:02.366 --> 02:29:08.339
THE SPEECH WHAT. A SYSTEM BUT

02:29:08.406 --> 02:29:09.206
AS I WROTE. ACTUALLY YOU JUST

02:29:09.273 --> 02:29:12.243

THEY ARE A CO BY CHARGED THANKS.

02:29:14.979 --> 02:29:16.614
AND SO I THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY

02:29:16.681 --> 02:29:19.116
WHERE WE SHOULD BE GULLWING

02:29:19.183 --> 02:29:20.284
WITH HOW WE'RE TRYING TO

02:29:20.351 --> 02:29:23.154

SUBJECT TO THE SWEAT AS OF THE

02:29:41.305 --> 02:29:43.240
POLITICAL AND CULTURAL WHIMS

02:29:43.307 --> 02:29:45.242

02:29:45.309 --> 02:29:48.412
USED WHEN YOU ARE DELIBERATING

02:29:48.479 --> 02:29:50.581

THAT SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN IN

CUSTODY THEY'RE NOT QUALIFIED.

02:31:17.802 --> 02:31:19.603

SO I DON'T DISAGREE IT'S NOT

02:31:34.118 --> 02:31:36.754
PERFECT. BUT WE ARE IN THE MOST

02:31:36.821 --> 02:31:39.223
DIFFICULT OF TIMES WHERE IT'S

02:31:39.290 --> 02:31:40.491
IMPOSSIBLE TO ADMINISTER

02:31:40.558 --> 02:31:42.426

ARTICULATED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:31:46.864 --> 02:31:50.067

IT'S EASY. I'M NOT SUGGESTING

02:32:08.085 --> 02:32:09.653
IT IS IN A WAY THAT COULD BE

02:32:09.720 --> 02:32:12.423
THE CREDIBILITY CAN BE ATTACKED

CONSIDERING THIS IMPORTANT

03:33:52.786 --> 03:33:54.655
ISSUE. THE COMMITTEE DESERVES A

03:33:54.721 --> 03:33:56.323
LOT OF CREDIT FOR TAKING BRADY

03:33:56.390 --> 03:33:58.525
SO SERIOUSLY. BUT THIS BILL IS

03:33:58.592 --> 03:34:00.994
DEEPLY FLAWED. IT'S NOT JUST A

03:34:01.061 --> 03:34:02.963
MISSED OPPORTUNITY IT'S

03:34:03.030 --> 03:34:03.564
ACTUALLY GOING TO MAKE THINGS

03:34:03.630 --> 03:34:06.867
WORSE. THE BASIC PROBLEM. IS

03:34:06.934 --> 03:34:09.503
THAT THE PREVIOUS. BILL IS MUCH

03:34:09.570 --> 03:34:11.238
NARROWER MUCH NARROWER THAN

03:34:11.305 --> 03:34:14.141
WHAT BRADY REQUIRES. IF YOU'RE

03:34:14.208 --> 03:34:14.675
GOING TO MAKE IT A FEDERAL

03:34:14.741 --> 03:34:16.143
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW LIKE BRADY

03:34:16.210 --> 03:34:18.412
INTO A STATUTE. YEP MAKE SURE

03:34:18.478 --> 03:34:21.014
THE STATUTE SWEEPS AT LEAST AS

03:34:21.081 --> 03:34:22.549
BROADLY AS BRADY. THE PREVIOUS

03:34:22.616 --> 03:34:25.252
HERE FELT THAT PASSED. HERE A

03:34:25.319 --> 03:34:26.653
FEW EXAMPLES OF CONDUCT IT

03:34:26.720 --> 03:34:29.189
SHOULD LAND AN OFFICER. ON A

03:34:29.256 --> 03:34:31.758
REAL BRIEF THE LAST. BUT NOT

03:34:31.825 --> 03:34:33.193
THE LIST TO FIND IN THIS BILL.

03:34:33.260 --> 03:34:34.995
FOR EXAMPLE AN OFFICER

03:34:35.062 --> 03:34:35.862
TESTIFIED THAT A SUPPRESSION

03:34:35.929 --> 03:34:37.831
HEARING. THE JUDGE FINDS THE

03:34:37.898 --> 03:34:39.833
OFFICER LIED AND TO SUPPRESS

03:34:39.900 --> 03:34:41.935
THAT THE EVIDENCE. THAT SHOULD

03:34:42.002 --> 03:34:42.869
PUT THE OFFICER ON THE BRADY

03:34:42.936 --> 03:34:44.871
LIST BUT IT WOULDN'T IN THE WAY%

03:34:44.938 --> 03:34:49.610
THE BREEDING AT IS DEFINED. IN

03:34:49.676 --> 03:34:51.845
MIGHT FIND OFFICER LIABLE. FOR

03:34:51.912 --> 03:34:53.480
VIOLATING SOMEONE'S CIVIL

03:34:53.547 --> 03:34:55.882
RIGHTS BY FABRICATING EVIDENCE.

03:34:55.949 --> 03:34:57.651
FOR A PROSECUTOR DURING TRIAL

03:34:57.718 --> 03:34:58.885
PRESS MIGHT DETERMINE THAT AN

03:34:58.952 --> 03:35:00.153
OFFICER IS NOT TELLING THE

03:35:00.220 --> 03:35:01.321
TRUTH AND DECIDE NOT TO CALL

03:35:01.388 --> 03:35:04.791
THE OFFICER AS A WITNESS. IN

03:35:04.858 --> 03:35:06.226
THESE INSTANCES THE OFFICERS

03:35:06.293 --> 03:35:07.561
CONDUCT SHOULD WIN THE OFFICER

03:35:07.628 --> 03:35:09.896
ON A PREVIOUS. BUT A PROSECUTOR

03:35:09.963 --> 03:35:12.399
FOLLOWING YOUR BILL DEFINITION

03:35:12.466 --> 03:35:15.602
OF THE PREVIOUS WITH MISTY AND

03:35:15.669 --> 03:35:16.136
OTHER EXAMPLES OF READING

03:35:16.203 --> 03:35:18.572
MATERIAL. THE BILL CONTAINS

03:35:18.639 --> 03:35:20.507
SOME OTHER WORRISOME CARGO.

03:35:20.574 --> 03:35:22.576
BREEDING MUST BE TURNED OVER

03:35:22.643 --> 03:35:25.078
CONTINUOUSLY BUT YOUR BILL

03:35:25.145 --> 03:35:27.147
ALLOWED JUST YEARLY UPDATE. THE

03:35:27.214 --> 03:35:29.216
PROCESS FOR NOTIFYING OFFICERS

03:35:29.283 --> 03:35:30.651
AND ALLOWING THEM TO APPEAL

03:35:30.717 --> 03:35:32.853
PRETTY DETERMINATION. IF THAT

03:35:32.919 --> 03:35:33.754
AT ALL INTERFERES WITH THE

03:35:33.820 --> 03:35:35.489
PROSECUTOR'S JUDGMENT ABOUT WHO

03:35:35.555 --> 03:35:38.091
SHOULD BE ON THE LIST WHAT THE

03:35:38.158 --> 03:35:40.327
F. I WOULD REDUCE WELL. IN AN

03:35:40.394 --> 03:35:41.128
OFFICER WHO LEADS THE

03:35:41.194 --> 03:35:43.397
DEPARTMENT. UNDER INVESTIGATION

03:35:43.463 --> 03:35:45.465
AND GOES TO ANOTHER DEPARTMENT.

03:35:45.532 --> 03:35:47.467
WOULD LIKELY BE ABLE TO EVADE

03:35:47.534 --> 03:35:48.669
DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS MIGHT

03:35:48.735 --> 03:35:50.437
NOT APPEAR ON EITHER

03:35:50.504 --> 03:35:52.539
DEPARTMENTS FREEDOS. SO YEAH

03:35:52.606 --> 03:35:54.741
THERE ARE FLAWS IN YOU MAY BE

03:35:54.808 --> 03:35:56.143
THINKING WELL THE BILL BETTER

03:35:56.209 --> 03:35:58.512
THAN NOTHING. IN I REALLY WISH

03:35:58.578 --> 03:36:01.114
I COULD AGREE WITH THAT. BUT

03:36:01.181 --> 03:36:01.815
THE TROUBLE IS THERE'S

03:36:01.882 --> 03:36:04.818
BASICALLY NO BENEFIT TO A U. S.

03:36:04.885 --> 03:36:06.887
BASED ON THE MATERIAL DESCRIBED

03:36:06.953 --> 03:36:09.389
IN SUBDIVISION G. TO. BECAUSE

03:36:09.456 --> 03:36:11.291
THE CURRENT GET ACCESS TO ALL

03:36:11.358 --> 03:36:13.260
THAT INFORMATION ON THEIR OWN

03:36:13.327 --> 03:36:15.295
THROUGH PUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS

03:36:15.362 --> 03:36:17.197
FOR COURT SEARCHING. SO WHEN

03:36:17.264 --> 03:36:18.298
YOU HAVE SUCH A MARGINAL

03:36:18.365 --> 03:36:20.000
BENEFIT IN TERMS OF WHAT THE

03:36:20.067 --> 03:36:21.802
BRADY WHAT IS GOING ON COVER IF

03:36:21.868 --> 03:36:23.704
THE THINK ABOUT WHAT THE COSTS

03:36:23.770 --> 03:36:27.074
ARE AND- I THINK. THE

03:36:27.140 --> 03:36:28.275
PRESIDENTIAL ONE. AT FIRST WHAT

03:36:28.342 --> 03:36:30.077
WELL INTENTIONED PROSECUTORS

03:36:30.143 --> 03:36:32.179
WHO BASED THEIR RESPONDENTS

03:36:32.245 --> 03:36:33.914
DEFINITION IN THIS BILL WILL

03:36:33.980 --> 03:36:35.215
END UP VIOLATING BRADY BECAUSE

03:36:35.282 --> 03:36:38.885
OF. THE BILL'S NARROW

03:36:38.952 --> 03:36:39.453
DEFINITION OF WHAT COUNTS.

03:36:39.519 --> 03:36:41.288
BORING ON THE BRIDGE LIST. IN

03:36:41.355 --> 03:36:41.855
THERE'S THE ADDITIONAL ISSUE

03:36:41.922 --> 03:36:43.623
THAT ANY PROSECUTOR WHO IS NOW

03:36:43.690 --> 03:36:45.158
FOLLOWING BRADY BY LOOKING AT

03:36:45.225 --> 03:36:46.760
THE FULL RANGE OF MISCONDUCT

03:36:46.827 --> 03:36:48.962
MATERIAL YOU KNOW BEYOND WHAT

03:36:49.029 --> 03:36:49.996
THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE. WELL

03:36:50.063 --> 03:36:51.298
THAT PROSECUTOR IS IMMEDIATELY

03:36:51.365 --> 03:36:52.766
GOING TO FACE PRESSURE FROM

03:36:52.833 --> 03:36:54.835
POLICE UNIONS. WHO ARE GONNA

03:36:54.901 --> 03:36:56.536
SAY JUST STICK TO WHAT THE

03:36:56.603 --> 03:36:57.871
STATUTE REQUIRES THE GONNA.

03:36:57.938 --> 03:36:59.272
ATTACK THAT A PROSECUTOR BUT

03:36:59.339 --> 03:37:02.042
POLITICALLY- IN TERMS OF

03:37:02.109 --> 03:37:04.444
LITIGATION. M. THEN REALLY

03:37:04.511 --> 03:37:05.946
WORST OF ALL THERE ARE BAD

03:37:06.012 --> 03:37:06.980
ACTORSWHO WILL SUPPRESS

03:37:07.047 --> 03:37:08.749
READING MATERIAL AND HIDE

03:37:08.815 --> 03:37:11.885
BEHIND THE EXCUSE. THAT THEY'RE

03:37:11.952 --> 03:37:13.687
JUST FOLLOWING THE STATUTE. ON

03:37:13.754 --> 03:37:15.555
TOP OF ALL THIS. I THINK THIS

03:37:15.622 --> 03:37:17.290
BILL IS GOING TO KEY UP ABOUT

03:37:17.357 --> 03:37:18.358
HALF A DOZEN CONSTITUTIONAL

03:37:18.425 --> 03:37:20.260
CHALLENGES AND IT WILL BE A

03:37:20.327 --> 03:37:22.529
REAL MESS. SO I DON'T WANT TO

03:37:22.596 --> 03:37:23.530
CLOSE I THINK THERE IS

03:37:23.597 --> 03:37:25.132
LEGISLATIVE ACTION THAT COULD

03:37:25.198 --> 03:37:26.733
IMPROVE PRETTY COMPLIANCE. I'M

03:37:26.800 --> 03:37:27.367
CONFIDENT YOU'RE GOING TO GET

03:37:27.434 --> 03:37:30.637
THERE. BUT FIRST YOU HAVE TO

03:37:30.704 --> 03:37:31.238
VOTE AGAINST THIS BILL. THANK

03:37:31.304 --> 03:37:34.708

ABLE TO BE ACCESSIBLE TO THE

04:04:13.872 --> 04:04:16.508
PUBLIC IN A VERY LIMITED SET- I

04:04:16.575 --> 04:04:18.110
THINK WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN

04:04:18.176 --> 04:04:20.812
RECENT MONTHS IS THAT. OUR

04:04:20.879 --> 04:04:24.249
COMMUNITIES. DEMAND MORE. AND

04:04:24.316 --> 04:04:27.419
THAT ALL OF US DESERVE TO KNOW

04:04:27.486 --> 04:04:28.587
ABOUT THE CONDUCT OF THE

04:04:28.653 --> 04:04:30.655
OFFICERS WHO WERE ON THE BEACH

04:04:30.722 --> 04:04:34.059
IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. AND WHILE

04:04:34.126 --> 04:04:35.594
SOME OF OUR POLICE UNIONS

04:04:35.660 --> 04:04:38.497
FOUGHT AGAINST FOURTEEN TWENTY

04:04:38.563 --> 04:04:40.465
ONE VERY STRENUOUSLY. THERE IS

04:04:40.532 --> 04:04:41.767
A VERY DIFFERENT ATTITUDE

04:04:41.833 --> 04:04:43.702
AMONGST OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT

04:04:43.769 --> 04:04:46.338
COMMUNITY TODAY AND PORAC HAS

04:04:46.405 --> 04:04:48.273
RECENTLY THOSE LARGEST UNION

04:04:48.340 --> 04:04:50.175
HAS RECENTLY PUT OUT THEIR

04:04:50.242 --> 04:04:52.110
STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES WHERE

04:04:52.177 --> 04:04:55.313
THEY INCLUDE. SUPPORT FOR MORE

04:04:55.380 --> 04:05:00.018
TRANSPARENCY. AND SO WHAT SB

04:05:00.085 --> 04:05:00.685
SEVEN SEVEN SIX DOES IS IT

04:05:00.752 --> 04:05:04.689
BUILDS ON FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE.

04:05:04.756 --> 04:05:05.557
AND IT STRENGTHENS OUR CURRENT

04:05:05.624 --> 04:05:08.760
LAW BY EXPANDING ACCESS TO

04:05:08.827 --> 04:05:10.962
RECORDS ON A WIDER RANGE OF

04:05:11.029 --> 04:05:14.199
USES OF FORCE. IT ALSO ALLOWS

04:05:14.266 --> 04:05:16.334
US TO FIND OUT ABOUT ANY

04:05:16.401 --> 04:05:17.869
OFFICERS THAT MAY HAVE A

04:05:17.936 --> 04:05:20.639
HISTORY OF ENGAGING IN RACIST

04:05:20.705 --> 04:05:23.542
OR DISCRIMINATORY ACTIONS. IT

04:05:23.608 --> 04:05:25.410
ALSO ALERT SAYS FIND OUT ABOUT

04:05:25.477 --> 04:05:27.412
INFORMATION ABOUT OFFICERS WHO

04:05:27.479 --> 04:05:28.847
HAVE A HISTORY OF CONDUCTING

04:05:28.914 --> 04:05:30.916
WRONGFUL ARRESTS OR WRONGFUL

04:05:30.982 --> 04:05:35.120
SEARCHES. AND SO THOSE ARE SOME

04:05:35.187 --> 04:05:36.321
OF THE WAYS IN WHICH THE

04:05:36.388 --> 04:05:37.456
RECORDS ARE EXPANDED.

04:05:37.522 --> 04:05:40.992
ADDITIONALLY WHAT WE HAVE FOUND

04:05:41.059 --> 04:05:44.062
IS THAT IN SOME CASES AN

04:05:44.129 --> 04:05:46.498
OFFICER WHO MAY HAPPENED WHERE

04:05:46.565 --> 04:05:48.867
THERE MAY BE THE AGENCY MAY BE

04:05:48.934 --> 04:05:50.902
INITIATING INVESTIGATION THAT

04:05:50.969 --> 04:05:54.573
THE OFFICER CHOOSES TO RESIGN.

04:05:54.639 --> 04:05:55.774
AND THEN THE INVESTIGATION

04:05:55.841 --> 04:05:57.809
THERE'S NO REAL PAPER TRAIL.

04:05:57.876 --> 04:06:00.779
AND THEN THE NEXT AGENCY WHO

04:06:00.846 --> 04:06:03.248
MIGHT HIRE THAT OFFICER HAS NO

04:06:03.315 --> 04:06:05.784
INFORMATION ABOUT THAT CONTACT

04:06:05.851 --> 04:06:08.620
SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS ALSO

04:06:08.687 --> 04:06:09.354
REQUIRED THAT A RECORD BE

04:06:09.421 --> 04:06:12.090
COMPLETED IF AN OFFICER RESIGNS

04:06:12.157 --> 04:06:13.592
PRIOR TO ANY COMPLETED

04:06:13.658 --> 04:06:18.830
INVESTIGATION. AND THEN IF- IF

04:06:18.897 --> 04:06:20.966
YOU ARE THE HIRING AGENCY IN

04:06:21.032 --> 04:06:22.567
YOUR HIRING SOMEONE WHO WAS A

04:06:22.634 --> 04:06:26.004
FORMER OFFICER THAT YOU REQUEST

04:06:26.071 --> 04:06:28.140
THE FULL ARRAY OF RECORDS SO DO

04:06:28.206 --> 04:06:30.775
YOU HAVE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THE

04:06:30.842 --> 04:06:31.877
BACKGROUND OF THE OFFICER THAT

04:06:31.943 --> 04:06:33.145
YOU'RE HIRING BECAUSE THE OTHER

04:06:33.211 --> 04:06:34.379
THING THAT WE HEAR VERY

04:06:34.446 --> 04:06:35.947
COMMONLY AS WE SOMETIMES HEAR

04:06:36.014 --> 04:06:39.084
EITHER MAYORS POLICE CHIEFS

04:06:39.151 --> 04:06:40.318
RATHER SAY WE DID NOT KNOW. THE

04:06:40.385 --> 04:06:42.053
HIS THIS BACKGROUND ABOUT THIS

04:06:42.120 --> 04:06:43.555
OFFICER. SO IT HELPS ENSURE

04:06:43.622 --> 04:06:47.092
THAT WE KNOW. IT ALSO ALLOWS

04:06:47.159 --> 04:06:47.893
FOR THE HOLDING OF RECORDS

04:06:47.959 --> 04:06:49.928
LONGER THAN FIVE YEARS NOW THE

04:06:49.995 --> 04:06:51.963
RECORDS OR ELECTRONIC OUR

04:06:52.030 --> 04:06:53.999
STATUTE THAT ONLY REQUIRED FIVE

04:06:54.065 --> 04:06:55.834
YEARS OF RECORDS ONE WAS REALLY

04:06:55.901 --> 04:06:57.335
APPROPRIATE WHEN OUR RECORDS

04:06:57.402 --> 04:06:58.403
WERE JUST PAPER NOW ALL OF OUR

04:06:58.470 --> 04:07:00.872
RECORDS OR ELECTRONIC THERE'S

04:07:00.939 --> 04:07:02.340
NO REASON TO HAVE THEM.

04:07:02.407 --> 04:07:03.542
ELIMINATED AFTER FIVE YEARS

04:07:03.608 --> 04:07:07.145
ONLY FINALLY IT DEALS WITH THE

04:07:07.212 --> 04:07:09.247
FACT THAT SOME AGENCIES WERE

04:07:09.314 --> 04:07:10.982
VERY RELUCTANT TO RELEASE

04:07:11.049 --> 04:07:15.153
RECORDS AND EITHER. DID NOT

04:07:15.220 --> 04:07:17.189
FOUR CHARGED EXORBITANT FEES TO

04:07:17.255 --> 04:07:20.225
THE PUBLIC- REQUESTING THEM SO

04:07:20.292 --> 04:07:22.260
THE BILL HAS SOME PROVISIONS

04:07:22.327 --> 04:07:23.461
REGARDING THAT. AND I WOULD

04:07:23.528 --> 04:07:25.163
NOTE THAT THE BILL DOES NOT GO

04:07:25.230 --> 04:07:27.199
AS FAR AS THE LAW THAT NEW YORK

04:07:27.265 --> 04:07:28.833
PASSED RECENTLY WHEN THEY

04:07:28.900 --> 04:07:31.870
REPEALED THEIR LAW FIFTY EIGHT.

04:07:31.937 --> 04:07:33.705
BUT I THINK THIS IS A VERY IT

04:07:33.772 --> 04:07:35.607
BRINGS CALIFORNIA MUCH CLOSER

04:07:35.674 --> 04:07:37.676
IN LINE WITH MANY MANY OTHER

04:07:37.742 --> 04:07:39.644
STATES THAT HAVE MORE

04:07:39.711 --> 04:07:41.546
TRANSPARENCY AROUND POLICE

04:07:41.613 --> 04:07:43.682
RECORDS AND I THINK THAT IT

04:07:43.748 --> 04:07:48.486
FITS. THAT APPROPRIATE- THAT

04:07:48.553 --> 04:07:50.589
APPROPRIATE RIGHT OF THE PUBLIC

04:07:50.655 --> 04:07:53.491
TO KNOW. WHILE STILL PROTECTING

04:07:53.558 --> 04:07:56.328
OUR OFFICERS FROM HAVING

04:07:56.394 --> 04:07:59.097
FRIVOLOUS OR- OR YOU KNOW

04:07:59.164 --> 04:08:00.632
COMPLAINTS THAT ARE UNFOUNDED

04:08:00.699 --> 04:08:02.767
BEING RELEASED THERE'S NO

04:08:02.834 --> 04:08:04.402
REASON FOR SUCH THINGS LIKE

04:08:04.469 --> 04:08:05.570
THAT. BUT WE CERTAINLY ALL

04:08:05.637 --> 04:08:07.772
DESERVE TO KNOW IF AN OFFICER

04:08:07.839 --> 04:08:10.242
HAS ANY KIND OF HISTORY OF-

04:08:10.308 --> 04:08:12.177

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE RELEASE

04:30:01.084 --> 04:30:02.619
ABILITY ARE LEAST THE

04:30:02.686 --> 04:30:04.655
PROTECTION THAT YOU JUST

04:30:04.721 --> 04:30:06.356
INDICATED TO CITIZENS

04:30:06.423 --> 04:30:08.959
COMPLAINTS. OR WE TALKING ABOUT

04:30:09.026 --> 04:30:10.427
INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS LIKE

04:30:10.494 --> 04:30:12.195
ADVERSE ACTIONS INVESTIGATIONS

04:30:12.262 --> 04:30:13.897
WHICH ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

04:30:13.964 --> 04:30:15.966
SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES BECAUSE

04:30:16.033 --> 04:30:17.534
ARE USUALLY DRIVEN THROUGH THE

04:30:17.601 --> 04:30:19.002
AGENCY THAT SHELTERS ARE

04:30:19.069 --> 04:30:20.804
INITIATED THROUGH THE AGENCIES.

04:30:20.871 --> 04:30:25.676
AT AROUND- THE BILL WOULD ALLOW.

04:30:25.742 --> 04:30:26.910
FOR COMPLAINTS BUT ALSO FOR

04:30:26.977 --> 04:30:28.845
INTERNAL DOES NOTREQUIRE SO IN

04:30:28.912 --> 04:30:31.048
OTHER WORDS IF THE AGENCY

04:30:31.114 --> 04:30:33.817
ITSELF HAS FOUNDED THAT THE

04:30:33.884 --> 04:30:35.619
OFFICER HAS ENGAGED IN THESE

04:30:35.686 --> 04:30:37.554
INCREASE RECORD THEN THAT'S AN

04:30:37.621 --> 04:30:39.189
AVAILABLE RECORD. BUT WHAT IF

04:30:39.256 --> 04:30:41.692
THEY'RE FOUND. DIFFERENTLY AND

04:30:41.758 --> 04:30:42.826
FOUND THERE IS NOT IF IT IS

04:30:42.893 --> 04:30:44.761
FOUND UNFOUNDED THEN THE RECORD

04:30:44.828 --> 04:30:47.064
WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE BECAUSE

04:30:47.130 --> 04:30:48.365
THAT THAT SEEMS TO BE REALLY

04:30:48.432 --> 04:30:50.400
AMBIGUOUS AND CAUSE RIGHT. AND

04:30:50.467 --> 04:30:52.002
THIS PARTICULAR BELT AT THAT

04:30:52.069 --> 04:30:54.204
TALKS ABOUT. THE RECORD OF THE

04:30:54.271 --> 04:30:56.773
CIVILIAN COMPLAINT AND YOU'RE

04:30:56.840 --> 04:30:58.175
STRUCK THE WORD CIVILIAN. AND

04:30:58.241 --> 04:31:00.944
JUST INDICATED COMPLAINT BUT I

04:31:01.011 --> 04:31:02.613
JUST THINK IT'S REALLY.

04:31:02.679 --> 04:31:05.382
CONCERNING THE WAY THAT IT'S

04:31:05.449 --> 04:31:07.551
CURRENTLY WRITTEN AND- I WOULD

04:31:07.618 --> 04:31:09.419
HOPE THAT MAYBE WE CAN CLARIFY

04:31:09.486 --> 04:31:12.422
THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT- C. H.

04:31:12.489 --> 04:31:14.324
HERE'S WHERE LAW ENFORCEMENT.

04:31:14.391 --> 04:31:16.693
AND MYSELF SHARE OF DEEP DEEP

04:31:16.760 --> 04:31:18.795
CONCERNS I MEAN. WE HAD SENATE

04:31:18.862 --> 04:31:22.199
BILL FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE WHICH-

04:31:22.265 --> 04:31:26.703
I FELT WAS NEGOTIATED AND- IT

04:31:26.770 --> 04:31:29.706
WAS AN ISSUE THAT. WAS TRYING

04:31:29.773 --> 04:31:30.340
TO IT CAME WITH SOME RESISTANCE

04:31:30.407 --> 04:31:33.310
NO QUESTION BUT I THINK THAT

04:31:33.377 --> 04:31:35.579
THE MOTIVATION WAS WAS IN THE

04:31:35.646 --> 04:31:38.548
RIGHT AREA AND I THINK THAT WE

04:31:38.615 --> 04:31:40.417
ARE MOVING IN A WAY THAT. THE

04:31:40.484 --> 04:31:43.253
PUBLIC WAS BENEFITTED AND NOW

04:31:43.320 --> 04:31:45.022
WE'VE GONE TO AN AREA THAT'S

04:31:45.088 --> 04:31:47.224
CREATED SO MUCH UNCERTAINTY.

04:31:47.290 --> 04:31:49.626
AND HERE'S WHERE THE ROBINS

04:31:49.693 --> 04:31:52.396
WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND I KNOW

04:31:52.462 --> 04:31:53.997
I KNOW IT'S PERCEIVED

04:31:54.064 --> 04:31:55.198
DIFFERENTLY BUT WE WANT TO MAKE

04:31:55.265 --> 04:31:57.000
SURE BECAUSE THERE ARE. LISTEN

04:31:57.067 --> 04:32:00.937
I WAS THE FIRST LINE SUPERVISOR

04:32:01.004 --> 04:32:01.571
FOR EIGHTEEN OF MY TWENTY EIGHT

04:32:01.638 --> 04:32:03.273
YEARS. AND I'VE INVESTIGATED

04:32:03.340 --> 04:32:04.574
MANY MANY MANY CITIZENS

04:32:04.641 --> 04:32:07.978
COMPLAINTS. SOME WERE WELL WELL

04:32:08.045 --> 04:32:10.080
WELL FUNDED AND- WE'RE THANKFUL

04:32:10.147 --> 04:32:11.648
THAT THEY WERE BROUGHT FORWARD.

04:32:11.715 --> 04:32:14.084
BECAUSE THEY- THEY WERE PART OF

04:32:14.151 --> 04:32:15.052
THE HEALING PROCESS AND THEN

04:32:15.118 --> 04:32:17.454
WERE PAR ALSO PART OF MAKING

04:32:17.521 --> 04:32:19.356
SUPERVISION AND THE DEPARTMENT

04:32:19.423 --> 04:32:21.124
AWARE OF MISCONDUCT. AND THAT

04:32:21.191 --> 04:32:23.060
ISN'T THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING

04:32:23.126 --> 04:32:25.062
TO BUILD BACK TRUST WITH OUR

04:32:25.128 --> 04:32:28.732
WITH OUR PUBLIC. HOWEVER THERE

04:32:28.799 --> 04:32:32.502
ALSO ARE SOME. HIGHLY MOTIVATED

04:32:32.569 --> 04:32:34.337
INDIVIDUALS WHO JUST WANT TO

04:32:34.404 --> 04:32:37.774
DISCREDIT. PEOPLE IN UNIFORM.

04:32:37.841 --> 04:32:40.610
AND I KNOW THAT SOME MAY FIND

04:32:40.677 --> 04:32:42.446
THAT TROUBLING SOME MAY NOT

04:32:42.512 --> 04:32:44.948
EVEN CARE BUT I WILL TELL YOU

04:32:45.015 --> 04:32:47.651
THAT. THE INTEGRITY THAT'S

04:32:47.718 --> 04:32:49.653
ATTACKED UNFAIRLY ALSO NEEDS TO

04:32:49.720 --> 04:32:53.090
BE GUARDED. AND I'M I'M JUST

04:32:53.156 --> 04:32:54.891
TELLING YOU THAT- THERE'S TOO

04:32:54.958 --> 04:32:56.093
MANY AMBIGUITIES IN THIS

04:32:56.159 --> 04:32:57.961
PARTICULAR BILL THAT MAKES ME

04:32:58.028 --> 04:32:59.396
FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT THOSE ARE

04:32:59.463 --> 04:33:01.531
NOT GUARDED. AND IF WE CAN GET

04:33:01.598 --> 04:33:03.033
TO A POINT TO WHERE WE COULD

04:33:03.100 --> 04:33:05.302
KNOW THAT THOSE FALSE

04:33:05.368 --> 04:33:07.571
ACCUSATIONS BECAUSE- ESPECIALLY

04:33:07.637 --> 04:33:10.006
NOW. WHEN THE SENTIMENT TAZ

04:33:10.073 --> 04:33:14.811
BECOME WHITE ANTI POLICE THAT'S

04:33:14.878 --> 04:33:16.079
PROBABLY THE MORE LIKELY THAT

04:33:16.146 --> 04:33:17.447
THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME OF

04:33:17.514 --> 04:33:20.383
THOSE ALLEGATIONS BROUGHT

04:33:20.450 --> 04:33:23.754
FORWARD AND- PEOPLE WHO ARE IN

04:33:23.820 --> 04:33:24.621
LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO ARE JUST

04:33:24.688 --> 04:33:26.890
TRYING TO SERVE THE PUBLIC AND

04:33:26.957 --> 04:33:28.992
ARE DOING THEIR LEVEL BEST BUT

04:33:29.059 --> 04:33:31.228
YET. THEY HAVE. THE FIERCELY

04:33:31.294 --> 04:33:33.363
MOTIVATED PEOPLE. TO BRING

04:33:33.430 --> 04:33:34.698
THESE ALLEGATIONS FORWARD THERE

04:33:34.765 --> 04:33:36.333
NEEDS TO BE SAFEGUARDS TO

04:33:36.399 --> 04:33:38.268
PROTECT THOSE OFFICERS. AND WE

04:33:38.335 --> 04:33:40.036
BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL GOES IN

04:33:40.103 --> 04:33:41.838
THE WRONG DIRECTION. AND I KNOW

04:33:41.905 --> 04:33:44.040
THAT'S NOT YOUR INTENTION. BUT

04:33:44.107 --> 04:33:46.409
WE HAVE TO FEEL AT LEAST DIED I

04:33:46.476 --> 04:33:47.244
CAN'T SPEAK FOR THEM BUT I KNOW

04:33:47.310 --> 04:33:50.213
I NEED TO FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE

04:33:50.280 --> 04:33:52.382
BUT THOSE ARE PRETTY. BECAUSE

04:33:52.449 --> 04:33:54.050
WE'RE WE'RE NOT AFFORDED THAT.

04:33:54.117 --> 04:33:55.619
THAT COMPANY COOPER RIGHT NOW

04:33:55.685 --> 04:33:58.722
SO- YEAH I WON'T BE ABLE TO

04:33:58.789 --> 04:34:00.457
SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY. BUT

04:34:00.524 --> 04:34:01.792
HOPEFULLY WE CAN AMENDED TO A

04:34:01.858 --> 04:34:03.560
POINT TO WHERE. WE CAN FEEL

04:34:03.627 --> 04:34:08.064
LIKE THOSE. UNFAIR ALLEGATIONS

04:34:08.131 --> 04:34:13.203
CAN BE PROTECTED. YEAH ANY

04:34:13.270 --> 04:34:18.375

CAN BE TO TARGET CERTAIN PEOPLE

04:34:38.695 --> 04:34:40.730
BUT IF WE THINK ABOUT. ANYONE

04:34:40.797 --> 04:34:44.467
IN PUBLIC SERVICE THERE CAN BE-

04:34:44.534 --> 04:34:47.604

04:35:39.823 --> 04:35:43.026
CERTAIN. LEVEL THAT WAS ALMOST

04:35:43.093 --> 04:35:46.863
SO HIGH THAT IT DIDN'T UNCOVER.

IS AN ACTUAL CRIME COMMITTED

05:01:36.511 --> 05:01:39.915
NOW ON THE ON THE POINT OF.

05:01:39.981 --> 05:01:43.718
WHETHER THIS DOES NOT ELIMINATE.

05:01:43.785 --> 05:01:46.288

IT DOES NOT ELIMINATE THAT.

05:02:01.002 --> 05:02:03.071
WHAT IT DOES IS REQUIRED BEFORE

BECAUSE THERE COULD BE

05:02:23.225 --> 05:02:25.927
MOTIVATIONS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO
