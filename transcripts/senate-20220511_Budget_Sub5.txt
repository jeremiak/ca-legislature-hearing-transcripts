AGAIN WE WILL BE DISCUSSING ALL THE ISSUES LISTED IN THE DISCUSSION SESSION SECTION OF THE AGENDA FIRST THEN TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT AND FINALLY TAKE OUR VOTES ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS THAT WE DISCUSSED IN OUR MARCH FIRST. TWENTY TWO FEB HEARINGS. WE WILL NOW BEGIN WITH ISSUE SIXTEEN THE SENATE DEMOCRATS PUTTING WEALTH TO WORK PROPOSALS FOR RETURNING CARE GIVERS TO WORK. WE WILL BEGIN WITH A CASE ALAMO FROM THE- BELIAU THEN MOVE ON TO CHRISTINE SCHUMACHER CALIFORNIA BUDGET AND POLICY CENTER AND THEN CATHERINE WHICH IT FROM LEGAL AID AT WORK MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAS ALOE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'M AS YOU SIXTEEN IS A COMPONENT OF THE SENATE BUDGET PLAN AND SOME OF THE WRITERS THE PREFABRICATION SCRIPTURE OF THE PROPOSAL- BEFORE TURNING IT OVER TO YOUR OTHER PANELISTS- THE PROPOSAL HAS TO DO WITH WAYS REPLACEMENT RATES FOR THE STATE'S SUPPOSED ABILITY INSURANCE AND PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM FOR. AN INDIVIDUAL'S BECOME DISABLED FOR TAKE LEAVE FOR- REASONS ELIGIBLE UNDER THE PAID FAMILY THE MOST AND ONE TO ONE WITH. A NEW CHILD- THERE ALWAYS WILL RECEIVE A CURRENT LAW SIX OR SO PER. OF THEIR- DIFFICULT WAGES ARE FOR PERIOD OF EIGHT TO SEE WEEKS DEPENDING ON PUBLIC. THE PROPOSAL THE SENATE FORTY IN THE WAIT REPLACE RATES SIXTY AND 70% AS I MENTIONED I TWO SEVENTY EIGHT AND NINETY PERCENT- THE DIFFERENCE BEING THAT WAITER BOYS RACE WOULD BE SET AT 70% FOR. MIDDLE AND UPPER WAGE EARNERS AND WILL BE SAID IF 90% WAGE REPLACEMENT FOR LOW ANSWERED LOW MIDDLE RANGE- INCOME WORKERS YOU'RE A WAITER PLACEMENT RATES WOULD GO INTO EFFECT BEGINNING IN. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. IT IS. FINALLY EIGHT AT THE SAME TIME THE PROPOSAL WOULD IN THE WAY REPLACE RATES IT WOULD ALSO ELIMINATE A CAP ON IN STATE LAW- ON THE TAXABLE WAGE BASE- SO THAT PAID FAMILY LEAVE AND DISABILITY INSURANCE PROGRAM IS FUNDED. BY A LEAD PAINT PAYROLL THOSE TAXES ARE ONLY DO UNDER CURRENT LAW ON THE FIRST A HUNDRED FORTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN WAGES SO ANY MONEY THAT WORKERS ARE IN ADDITION A SORT OF AN ACTUAL FORTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IS NOT SUCH TO THIS WORLD. THAT. WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE TAX. IN THE END DEVELOPMENT FOR APART- DAY ON THE- IT APPEARS ABOUT TWENTY PER OF WE- CURRENTLY OR ABOUT THAT CAP SO BY. HOW THE EXISTING PAYROLL. WOULD DISTRICT GENERATE ADDITIONAL HUNDRED TO FUND THESE INCREASED BENEFITS BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE I HAVE TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS BUT OTHERWISE I'LL TURN IT OVER TO YOUR OTHER PANELISTS THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SHOE MACHER. SHARE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KRISTEN SURE HER NUMBER THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET POLICY CENTER APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY I'VE BEEN ASKED TO REVIEW KEY POINTS FROM TWO ANALYSES RELEASED BY THE BUDGET CENTER. JUST THIS YEAR. THE VAST MAJORITY OF WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA CONTRIBUTED TO THE STATE'S PAID FAMILY LEAVE AND DISABILITY INSURANCE PROGRAMS. AND THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR PAID TIME OFF AS CARE NEEDS ARE RICE. BUT LOW PAYMENT RATES BLOCK WORKERS FROM USING THESE PROGRAMS IN TIMES OF NEED. BECAUSE MANY WORKERS CAN'T PAY THE BILLS WITH A FRACTION OF THEIR ATTORNEYS. OUR RECORDS WITH LOW WAGE. WHO AND HEALTH ARE JUST. WOMEN BLACK AND WHITE NEXT WORKERS THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE BECAUSE THEY'RE ALREADY STRUGGLING TO GET BY ON 1100% OF THIRTY. SO THIS FIRST CHART SHOWS THAT 37% OF THE WORKERS ELIGIBLE FOR PAID TIME OFF OUR WORKERS PAID LESS THAN TWENTY THOUSAND ANNUALLY. YES THE SAME WORKERS ARE UNDER REPRESENTED IN THOSE UTILIZING PAID FAMILY LEAVE THEY COMPRISE JUST 40% OF THOSE WHO TOOK PAID LEAVE IN TWENTY TWENTY. ONE NOT SHOWN HERE IN THIS CHART WORKERS PAID THE WAGES ARE ALSO UNDER REPRESENTED AMONG THOSE USING THE STATE'S DISABILITY INSURANCE PROGRAM. FOR THEIR OWN HEALTH CONCERNS. THE GRAPHIC ILLUSTRATES THE BENEFIT TO CALIFORNIA'S PAID FAMILY LEAVE AND DISABILITY INSURANCE PROGRAMS ARE LOWER THAN BENEFITS. IN MOST OTHER STATES WITH SIMILAR PROGRAMS. SO CALIFORNIA WORKERS WITH VERY LOW WAGES FOR C. PANT REYES EQUAL OTHER WORKERS EARN 60% OF EARNINGS. EVEN FULL TIME WORKERS EIGHT THE STATEWIDE MINIMUM WAGE TO FIFTEEN DOLLARS PER HOUR TOO MUCH. TO QUALIFY FOR THE HIGHER PAY RATE. OTHER STATES HEALTH. REPRESENT ON THE SHIRT WITH THE ORANGE BAR HAS THE SECOND LOWEST PAYMENT RATE FOR WORKERS MAKING FIFTEEN DOLLARS PER HOUR. STATE AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA WOULD PROVIDE AT LEAST 90% WE JUST WELL TAKING TIME OFF AN OREGON HAS THE HIGHEST PAYMENT RATES FOR WORKERS WITH LOW WAGES PROVIDING 1100% OF WAGES WHEN TAKING LIFE. AND WITHOUT ACTUALLY THIS YEAR OUR PAYMENT RATES FOR THESE PROGRAMS WILL REVERT TO JUST 55% OF EARNINGS AT THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO FAMILY LEAVE AND STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE PROGRAMS ARE FUNDED ENTIRELY WITH WORKERS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE DISABILITY INSURANCE FUND. AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THIS FUND REMAINS SOLVENT TO ENSURE WORKERS RECEIVE THE BENEFITS THAT THEY'VE PAID FOR. CURRENTLY WORKERS DO NOT CONTRIBUTE ONCE A FINE ON EARNINGS OVER CERTAIN AMOUNT AGAIN REFER TO AS THE WEEKS ON. SET AT ABOUT A HUNDRED FORTY FIVE THOUSAND PER YEAR. THE CURRENT PROPOSAL TO INCREASE PAYMENT RATES WILL ENSURE THAT DISABILITY INSURANCE FUND REMAIN SOLVENT REMOVING THIS WEEK CEILING. AS ILLUSTRATED IN THE FINAL TURN- DATA. INVESTITORI OF HEALTH BURKE WOULD BE HONEST. BY THE CHANGE. JUST 9% OF HIGH INCOME WORKERS HAD. ABOUT THAT WE SILLY. TWENTY TWENTY. BUT I DO SEE PAYMENT RTES PARTICULARLY FOR LOWER WAGE WORKERS. WE WOULD ELIMINATE A KEY BARRIER TO ACCESS YOU NEED TO PROGRAMS. AND A LOT MORE CALIFORNIANS TAKE PAID TIME OFF PAID TIME OFF THAT THEY PAY FOR THE CARE FOR THEMSELVES. AND THEIR FAMILIES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS MY CONTACT INFORMATIONS ON THE SLIDE IF YOU WERE TO GET IN TOUCH AFTER THE HEARING AS WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS US YOU. AND NOW WE WILL CONTINUE WITH MISS WHICH IS. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME MY NAME IS KATHERINE WHICH AND I'M A STAFF ATTORNEY FOR LEGAL AID AT WORKS WORK AND FAMILY PROGRAM WHICH EMPOWERS WORKERS WHO ARE PREGNANT PARENTS FAMILY CARE GIVERS OR WITH THEIR OWN SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITIONS. TIME OFF FROM WORK AND GET OTHER WORK PLACE TO COMMONSENSE AND AS A PART OF THAT WORK WE OPERATE A FREE WORKING FAMILY HEALTH LINE WHERE WE OFFER LEGAL ADVICE AND INFORMATION ABOUT CARE GIVING AND PARENTING WORKPLACE RIGHT. EVERY YEAR WE RECEIVE OVER THOUSAND CALLS FROM FOLKS WORKING IN INDUSTRIES ALL ACROSS THE STATE STRUGGLING TO SEE HOW THEY CAN MEET THEIR FAMILY CARE NEEDS WITHOUT RISKING ECONOMIC RUIN. AND ONE ISSUE THAT WE'VE SEEN COME UP FREQUENTLY FOR YEARS IS THE INACCESSIBILITY OF PAID FAMILY LEAVE AND STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE TO CALIFORNIANS WITH LOW INCOMES. ALMOST ALL WORKERS ACROSS THE STATE PAYS ALL FRACTION OF THEIR I'M INTO THE FIND. THE IDEA BEING THAT THIS WILL WHEN THEY RECEIVE INCOME FROM THE FUNDS FOR FAMILY CAREGIVING FUNDING OR THEIR OWN HEALTH IT WILL ALLOW THEM TO TAKE TIME OFF FROM WORK AND SURVIVE WITHOUT THEIR REGULAR WAGES. MOST WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA RECEIVE 60% OF THEIR REGULAR INCOME ON STI OR PAID FAMILY LEAVE AND ONLY THOSE MAKING UNDER ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY WILL RECEIVE 70% OF THEIR INCOME. SO NOT ONLY DOES THIS NOT PROVIDE ENOUGH INCOME BECAUSE IT ASSUMES THAT THE LOWEST WAGE CALIFORNIANS CAN AFFORD TO GET DO YOU LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS QUALIFY THAT COMPARATIVELY HIGHER WAGE REPLACEMENT. RATE THE- WORKERS. ENFOLDS MINIMUM WAGE WORKERS IT DRAWS THE LINE ADDED IN LEVELS LOW THAT IN A TWO INCOME HOUSEHOLD TO PARENTS RECEIVING BENEFITS COULD NOT EVEN COVER THE BASIC COSTS OF LIVING FOR TWO ADULTS AND AN INFANT AND MODOC COUNTY MUCH LESS LOS ANGELES OR THE BAY AREA AND WE'VE SEEN THIS BORN OUT IN OUR WORK WE'VE HEARD FROM NEW MOTHER FAR MORE. FIRST WORKWEEKS HAVING THEIR BABY THEY COULDN'T AFFORD TO LIVE ON THE REST YEAH I BENEFITS SOME HAVE LATER HAD TO RE APPLY FOR STI BECAUSE THEY WERE INJURED FROM RETURNING TO WORK EARLY WE'VE HEARD FROM TWO PARENT COLLEGE GRADUATE HOUSEHOLDS WERE NEITHER PARENT BABY BONDING LEAVE BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT AFFORD TO LIVE OFF 60% OF THEIR INCOME AS WELL AS THE DAD WHO WAS ONLY ABLE TO SPEND TWO HOURS WITH HIS NEW BABY AND THE NEXT YEAR BECAUSE HE COULDN'T AFFORD. MORE TIME UP. AND DOCTORS HAVE SHARED WITH US HOW LOW WAGE REPLACEMENT RATES HAVE INTERFERED WITH THEIR PATIENT CARE. A HUSBAND AND FATHER WHO WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER AND KEPT WORKING IN DELAYING TREATMENT FOR TOO LONG. BECAUSE HE COULDN'T AFFORD LEAVES WHO THEN DIED TUESDAY. TO ADULT CHILDREN WHO HAD TO TAKE WHO COULDN'T AFFORD TO TAKE LEAVE CELL LEFT THEIR MOTHER WHO HAD DEMENTIA HOME ALONE HAVING NO OTHER CHOICE. AND IT RESULTED IN AVOIDABLE EMERGENCY CARE. I'VE SPOKEN WITH NEW MOTHERS FOR WHOM THE IDEA THAT THEY COULD LIVE OFF OF 60% OF THEIR INCOME WAS SO ABSURD THAT THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND HOW THIS COULD BE HOW THE PROGRAM WAS ACTUALLY DESIGNED. CALIFORNIA NEEDS A PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES 90% OF INCOME TO LOWER WAGE WORKERS. AND DEFINES LOWER WAGE WORKERS REALISTICALLY. THANK YOU FOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SOME WE HAVE WILL COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. SENATORS QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. GOOD GOOD GOOD THANK YOU YEAH WELL OF I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL THIS IS SOMETHING THAT- YOU KNOW MANY OF US HAVE ENCOUNTERED IN OUR WORK- AS FAR AS YOUR LOW WAGE. YOUR LOW WAGE WORKER YOU'RE TRYING TO SPEND TIME WITH YOUR FAMILY WHETHER IT'S A AN ELDERLY. PERSON WHO MAY BE ILL OR YOUR NEWBORN BABY- THESE ARE ALL SORT OF THINGS THAT WE SAY WE KNOW MAKE YOUR- MONGER UP. MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO HAVE THE KIND OF RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR FAMILY THAT THAT STRENGTHENS IT LEADS TO A STRONGER COMMUNITY- SO I THINK THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS THAT ARE IMPACTED BY THIS THAT IT'S- KIND OF EMBARRASSING THAT CALIFORNIA'S THE LOW COMPARED TO- COMPARED TO OTHER STATES AS FAR AS WHAT WE ACTUALLY- PROVIDE. AND I THINK THE LAST POINT IS THAT THIS IS A BENEFIT THAT'S PAID FOR BY THE WORKERS THEMSELVES. LAWYERS DO NOT CONTRIBUTE BUT SO BEING ABLE TO UTILIZE SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE PAYING INTO I THINK IS THE MOST FAIR THING THAT WE CAN DO BESIDES THE STRENGTH THAT IT PROVIDES FOR OUR- FAMILY. OF I'M REALLY PROUD OF THIS AS- SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO- URGE THE- GOVERNOR TO ACCEPT IN HIS BUDGET SO- THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. THANK YOU TO THE MEMBERS OF THE PANEL WHO ARE HERE TODAY YOU SHOULD YOU'RE VERY MUCH AND THANKS FOR THE SPECIFIC. EXAMPLES THAT YOU GAVE ABOUT THE IMPACT THAT THIS HAS ON ON PEOPLE.

A WHAT'S THE CONNECTION DOES THIS PROGRAM START- ONCE- THE INDIVIDUAL IS RELEASED OR PRIOR TO THAT WHAT'S THE CONNECTION TO. OF PREPARATION BEFORE THE INDIVIDUALS ARE RELEASED- TO GO INTO THESE PROGRAMS OF GETTING THE JOB AFTER THEY'RE RELEASED. YES MA'AM SO THIS PARTICULAR ONE WAS SUPPORT PEOPLE THAT ARE RELEASED UPON THEIR RELEASE- THE WAY IT WORKS IS THEY'RE PAID A STIPEND OR FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR SPECIFICALLY TO TRAIN IN A PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. OR ANOTHER TRACK THE PANEL WITH THE WITH THE APPOINTMENT FOR OUR PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM IS FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR. BUT THIRTEEN WEEKS. YOU'RE GOING TO A YOUNG. AND SO I'VE THAT THIRTEEN WEEK WHEN THEY SHOW UP ON TO DO EVERYTHING CORRECTLY THEY'RE ABLE TO GOING TO THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM WHICH IS THE FIRST STEP INTO A UNION PROGRAM. WITHIN THREE TO FIVE YEARS THE JOURNEY OUT AND SOLD THIS ALLOWS THE INDIVIDUALS HAS BEEN RELEASED FROM INCARCERATION TO NOT HAVE TO STRUGGLE WITH BOTH. PURSUANT EDUCATION OR TRAINING AND WORKING. BY ALLOWING THEM TO COMBINE THE TWO TRAINING AND BE IN A WORD ABOUT EARNS SOME MONEY SO THAT THEY CAN SURVIVE WHILE THE WILD WILD. IN SOCIETY. I LIKE TO SHOW UP ON A ON A- HIGH NOTE WHEN YOU THINK THAT SOME OF OUR MEMBERS SHARE WITH ME. EVERY A JOURNEY OUT BETWEEN THREE AND FIVE YEARS EARNS EASILY SIX FIGURES IN THE MORNING. THAT'S VERY GOOD TO KNOW. THAT'S VERY GOOD THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO. ANYONE YEAH THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SENATORS COMMENTS QUESTIONS. SOMEWHAT TIMELY I GUESS I WAS AT THE TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE REENTRY CENTER IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY- JUST- TEN DAYS TEN DAYS AGO. IN HERE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THE WORK IS THE- REALIGNMENT- I GUESS NO PUN INTENDED BUT- THE HOUSING IN THE EMPLOYMENT BARRIERS ARE STILL- THE TWO BIGGEST THINGS THAT THAT YOU SEE THE PROGRAM'S WORKING THE- YOU KNOW THE- SORT OF THE BUILT IN WRAPAROUND SERVICES IN. THE RECEPTION AND EVERYTHING THAT GOES ALONG WITH RE ENTRY PROCESS THAT I COULD SEE AT LEAST OUR OWN COUNTY IS. WONDERFUL BUT THE INCOME TO AFFORD HOUSING IS- THIS IS STILL A HUGE ISSUE SO IT'S GREAT TO SEE THIS. THIS EFFORT. THANK YOU THANK YOU. AND FINALLY MR LEWIS COULD YOU EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE- WHAT US SENATOR CORTESE JUST MENTIONED THE WRAPAROUND SERVICES HOW THEY FIT INTO THIS OF OPPORTUNITY FOR. PRE APPRENTICESHIP AND THEN APPRENTICESHIP- THE WORK THAT YOU DO BUT HOW DID THE WRAPAROUND SERVICES FIT INTO ALL OF THIS HOW DO YOU COORDINATE.

SUM GOES INTO ALL THE PRISONS EVERY PERSON IS INCARCERATED WILL BE AWARE OF THE SERVICES AVAILABLE BECAUSE WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT.

THEN SPECIFICALLY TO THE QUESTION THAT YOU JUST ACT WRAPAROUND SERVICES INCLUDE EVERYTHING FROM THERAPY OFTENTIMES PEOPLE GOING TO PRISON WHAT A GREAT DEAL OF COMEDY HAS NOT BEEN ADDRESSED AND SADLY WHILE IMPRISONED THOSE PROBLEMS ARE NOT ADDRESSED AND SO WHEN A WRAPAROUND SERVICES WILL BE ACCESS TO REPAIR. ANOTHER IS HOUSING IN ORDER FOR A PERSON TO BE ABLE TO REALLY SEE SEED- AND EMPLOYMENT AND CREATE A PATHWAY FROM INCARCERATION YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SAFE PLACE TO REST ANDTO PREPARE TO GO TO WORK TODAY SO HOUSING IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE- BROWSERS. OF THE BILL'S WRAPS AROUND SERVICES AS A PERSON LEARNS HOW TO MANAGER AND BUDGET MIGHT FINANCIAL LITERACY GUIDANCE- BLOOD TO THE TRANSITION FROM INCARCERATION- TWO OF THREE.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF WE WANT TO MOVE ON NOW TO OF ONE EITHER DOUGLAS PLEASE. MORNING EVERYONE REALLY LIKES IT THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY. DO YOU CONSTRUCTION TRADES PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES UP WORK SOCIAL MOBILITY FOR WOMEN IN THE UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITY. THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY HAS ONE OF THE SMALLEST PAY GAPS BETWEEN WOMEN AND MEN. WITH WOMEN EARNING ON AN AVERAGE OF NINETY DOLLAR COMPARED TO ME. DESPITE WOMEN MAKING UP 2407% OF THE TOTAL EMPLOYMENT IN THE U. S. ONLY TEN POINT THREE. PERCENT ARE REPRESENTED IN THE NATION WIDE CONSTRUCTION WORK FORCE ACCORDING TO THE U. S. BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS. FARTHER ONLY FIELD JOB. WITH MOST WOMEN IN THE TRADES PLACED IN OFFICE POSITIONS REINFORCING OUTDATED IDEAS THEY CANNOT HANDLE THE PHYSICAL DEMANDS OF THE TRADE. BUT PERCENTAGE OF WOMEN IN THE FIELD OF RAISING DUE IN PART TO TRAILBLAZERS PAVING THE WAY FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF WOMEN IN CONSTRUCTION. HELLO MY NAME IS JUANITA I WAS ONE OF THE ONLY WOMEN IN THE TRENCHES WHEN I JOIN THE CONSTRUCTION TRADE AS A CARPENTER APPRENTICE IN NINETEEN AS A CARPENTER APPRENTICE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE I WORKED AS A COMMERCIAL CARPENTER FOR SIXTEEN YEARS. ADD A LAND SURVEYOR FOR ANOTHER FIFTEEN. AS A SINGLE MOTHER. I INTO THE TREE TO PROVIDE FOR MY SON AND GIVE US A STABILIZE. BECAUSE OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE UNION TRADES I WAS ABLE TO SEND MY CHILD OFF TO A FOUR YEAR COLLEGE DEBT FREE. THIS WAS THE MOST REWARDING EXPERIENCE. L. A. CATALYST TO SHARE MY TESTIMONY AND TO ENCOURAGE MY COMMUNITY TO UNDERSTAND THAT UNION CONSTRUCTION CAREERS OR A PATHWAY TO BECOME STABLE AND FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE. MY RESEARCH SHOWS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A NEW FIVE YEAR INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN GUARANTEED FUNDING IN VARIOUS SECTORS OF THE STATE THIS MEANS JOBS JOBS WOMEN JOBS FOR YOU ESPECIALLY JOBS RESIDENTS TO WORK. ON THE LOCAL PROJECTS UNDERWAY NOW WHAT I DO EVERY DAY. I TEACH THE PRE APPRENTICE CONSTRUCTION TRAINING PROGRAM. ON MAY SIX I GRADUATED THIRTEEN WHEN. THIS IS MY NINTH CLASS THREE OF THE CLASSES HAVE BEEN WOMEN THE FIRST CLASS WE GRADUATED FOURTEEN WOMEN. ALL WOMEN COLD WAR SECOND CLASS I GRADUATED TWENTY FIVE WOMEN ALL WOMEN FOR. EVERY ONE OF THESE NINE CLASSES. ALL THE CLASSES HAVE BEEN 50% PLUS WOMEN. ALL BUT ONE AND ONLY HALF THREE THE CLASS I GRADUATED IN DECEMBER. IN WOMEN AND FOUR MEN. I AM HERE TO INSPIRE YOU ON THE IMPORTANCE OF NOT ONLY JOINING THE CONSTRUCTION TRADES BUT ALSO SUPPORTING PATHWAYS FOR THE NEXT GENERATION ENTERING THE TREE. MAKING SPACE FOR MORE WOMEN FROM ALL BACKGROUNDS PARTICULARLY LOW INCOME SINGLE MOTHERS OF COLOR NOW IS THE TIME ESPECIALLY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO ACTIVELY RECRUIT AND STAND BEHIND BILLS ARE COMING THIS WAY TO SUPPORT THAT VERY CALL. WITH THIS PROGRAM. WHEN WE GRADUATE WE WORK WITH THEM ANOTHER YEAR TO PLACE THEM IN CONSTRUCTION TRADES NOW THIS CLASS I JUST GRADUATED I HAVE A YOUNG LADY THAT JUST ENTERED THE PLUMBERS. YESTERDAY I HAVE THREE YOUNG LADIES THAT WILL GO DIRECTLY TO THE LABORS I HAVE THREE YOUNG LADIES THAT JUST PASSED THE SURVEY. SO I KNOW IT'S POSSIBLE WE JUST NEED MORE HELP THANK YOU IF I HAD HEARD YOU. OF WHEN I WAS MUCH YOUNGER AND DECIDING WHAT TO DO IN MY LIFE I THINK I WOULD HAVE GONE INTO ONE OF THE TRAITS. IT YEAH I'VE GOTTA ADMIT MANAGER IT IS NEVER TOO LATE. YOU CAN YOU ARE TERM LIMITED I WOULD POINT OUT SHE- USED TO THINKING ABOUT THAT RIGHTNOW. WELL YOU- THANK YOU SO MUCH- THANK YOU FOR.

ONE AND A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK ALL EVERYTHING'S DONE IN BIG NUMBERS BUT ONE BY ONE BY ONE IS WHAT ADDS UP TO MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN OUR COMMUNITIES SO YOU'VE A YOU'VE ADDED A WHOLE NEW LEVEL OF EXCITEMENT AND ENTHUSIASM FOR ME- I'VE BEEN FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO KNOW- AND BE WITH WOMEN IN THE TRADES THAT IS NOT TRUE. HELLO OF WOMEN IN NONTRADITIONAL TRADE- CAREERS AND EXTRAORDINARY JUST AS OBVIOUSLY JUST AS EXTRAORDINARY AS THE MAN- AND TO SEE THEM AND THE DIVERSE TRADES IS VERY EXCITING AT THE TO SEE THAT YOUR EXPERIENCE- CAN I JUST ASK YOU ONE QUESTION WHAT WHAT DO YOU FIND. THE SINGLE OR WHATEVER ONE OR TWO BIGGEST ISSUES THAT WOMEN THEMSELVES FACE. AS THEY DECIDE TO ENTER INTO THESE CAREERS HEALTHCARE. MMHM THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE PROBLEM BECAUSE OF THE HOURS THAT YOU WORK IN CONSTRUCTION I WOULD HAVE TO REALLY TAKE MY SON TO FRESNO AND DROP HIM OFF AT MY MOTHER'S. BECAUSE THE CONSTRUCTION TRADES USUALLY START AT SIX AM OR SEVEN AM AND THERE'S- NO ONE THAT OPENS OF CHILD CARE EARLY ENOUGH OVERTIME IT'S USUALLY LIKE YOU GETTING READY TO GO HOME AT THREE PM AND IT'S LIKE OH NO NO NO YOU GOT TO SAY THAT AFTERWARDS SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN HOURS A DAY. AND YOU CAN'T JUST CALL YOUR CHILD CARE PROVIDER AND TELL THEM I CAN'T COME UNTIL NINETY NINE PM WBB OFF IT FOR RIGHT. THE CHILD HERE WAS THE BIGGEST. THE MOST BIGGEST ISSUE OKAY GREAT WELL WE'LL HAVE TO TAKE THAT UP WE HAVE A WE HAVE A VERY SUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGN TO INCREASE NOT ONLY THE SLOTS FOR CHILD CARE BUT I THINK TAKING THAT INTO CONSIDERATION WE SHOULD CONNECTED.

THE TWO MOST COMMON FORMS OF RETALIATION HE FIRED AND THEN THE REST TO CALL IMMIGRATION MAKING IMMIGRANTS AND LOW WAGE WORKERS WHO LITERALLY CAN'T MISS A PAYCHECK. EXTREMELY VULNERABLE TO THE CHILLING EFFECTS OF RETALIATION. YES DESPITE BACK EVERY YEAR NEARLY FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE BRAVE ENOUGH TO FILE A COMPLAINT WITH ONE OF THE LABOR COMMISSIONER SIXTEEN OFFICES.

SO WE'LL START WITH A DIR- AND I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS THAT- MISS. WHO WILL BE SPEAKING FOR. OKAY MISTING UP OR MISTER IVERSON- OKAY- COULD YOU GO THROUGH AND- I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS- AND DOUG TELL ME HOW MANY VACANCIES THERE ARE AT THE I. R. TODAY I AM AND THANK YOU FOR HIGHLIGHTING THE PROGRESS THAT WAS MADE OF ESPECIALLY SINCE THE ADA AUTHORITY WAS. READ DELEGATED OF WHAT IS THE WHAT IS THE NUMBER OF VACANCIES VACANCIES THAT EXIST TODAY WHAT'S YOUR VACANCY RATE OF PER DIVISION. OF AN OVERALL I THINK YOU MENTIONED THIS WHAT IS YOUR RECRUITMENT AND- AND ESPECIALLY RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION STRATEGY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. THANK YOU CAN I PAINT DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS SO. CURRENTLY DIR HAS NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR BANQUETTE BACON POSITIONS OUT OF THREE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE WHICH IS THAT VACANCY RATE OF APPROXIMATELY TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT. I AND I'M GONNA JUST GO BY DIVISION AS I WAS WHAT WAS REQUESTED SO. FOR THE DIVISION OF APPRENTICESHIP STANDARDS THERE'S THIRTY SEVEN POSITIONS VACANT. I WHICH IS A COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE IS TWO HUNDRED THIRTY NINE POSITIONS VACANT. WHICH IS A THIRTY TWO POINT. ZERO WELL HELLO. HOUSE TWO HUNDRED FORTY TWO POSITIONS VACANT WHICH IS A 30% VACANCY RATE AND THEN THE DIVISION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION HAS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TWO POSITIONS VACANT WHICH IS A 23% VACANCY RATE. I WOULD LIKE IF I MAY PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL CONTEXT IN RELATION TO THESE POSITIONS THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL FOR THE COMMITTEE. TO START THAT THE VACANT POSITION FIGURE ALSO INCLUDES ABOUT A HUNDRED NINETY SIX POINT FIVE NEW POSITION. ALLOCATED TO THE DEPARTMENT AND BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL FROM PREVIOUS YEARS IT'S HARD TO PUT THAT AN ADDITIONAL CONTACTS THAT MEANS THOSE NEW POSITIONS MAKE UP ABOUT TWENTY ONE PERCENT. OF THE BACON POSITIONS THAT I JUST REFERENCED. I WOULD ALSO JUST LIKE TO NOTE AS WELL THAT LIKE MANY DEPARTMENTS SOME OF OUR HIRES ARE INTERNAL TRANSFERS OR PROMOTIONS WHICH AREN'T REFLECTED. IN VACANCY RATE BUT WE DO THINK IT REPRESENTS AN IMPORTANT MOBILITY OPPORTUNITY FOR THE MEMBERS OF OUR TEAM. I'VE AND IF AND I CAN PAUSE THERE BUT THEN I CAME WARRANT. HIRING AND RETENTION STRATEGY IF THE COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE. YES PLEASE COULD YOU. YES THANK YOU THE CLIP. SO IN TERMS OF OUR FOR HIRE. RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION STRATEGY SO FOR HIRING WE DO IT IS VITAL TO ENSURE THAT OUR HIRING MANAGERS HAVE THE TOOLS AND INFORMATION THEY NEED. TO ASSIST THEM IN THE HIRING PROCESS AS WELL AS ENSURE THAT OUR RECRUITMENT FOLLOW THE MERIT BASED HIRING SYSTEM AND SO JUST TO PROVIDE SOME CONCRETE EXAMPLES FOR THE COMMITTEE IN CASE IT'S HELPFUL OF WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. WE'VE TRAINED ALL OF OUR HIRING MANAGERS AND SUPERVISORS ON COLLEGE OUR HIRING PRACTICES. WE'VE DEVELOPED AND DISTRIBUTED I TOOL KIT OF RESOURCES AND JOB AIDS FOR OUR TEAM MEMBERS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN HIRING TWO ASSISTANT THINGS LIKE DROPPING DUTY STATEMENTS. INTERVIEW QUESTIONS AND ALSO HELP ENSURING THE COMPLETION OF HIRING PACKAGES. AND THEN WE'VE ALSO IMPLEMENTED STRATEGIES THAT CAN HELP FACILITATE MORE HIRING AT SCALE I AND SO THIS CAN INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE INTERVIEWING LARGER POOLS OF CANDIDATES AND MAKING MULTIPLE HIRES WHEN WE HAVE. OPENINGS FOR THE SAME CLASSIFICATION TRENDS THE FOR EXAMPLE WE HAD ONE DIVISION RECENTLY DO THIS WHERE THEY INTERVIEWED OVER FIFTY CANDIDATES AND WERE ABLE TO SELL SIXTEEN LEGAL POSITIONS. ARE ON ON THE RECRUITMENT SIDE WE'VE EXPANDED OUR EFFORTS TO MEET PROSPECTIVE CANDIDATES WHERE THEY ARE SO THAT THEY CAN LEARN THE I. R. DOT CA DOT GOV SLASH DIR JOBS AND THIS WEBSITE IN A WAY IS A ONE STOP SHOP FOR DIR EMPLOYMENT INFORMATION SO THIS INCLUDES INFORMATIONAL VIDEOS ABOUT OUR DEPARTMENT HIGHLIGHTS OF CERTAIN JOB CLASSIFICATIONS WE ALSO GIVE YOU SOME GUIDANCE TO APPLICANTS REGARDING THAT STATE HIRING PROCESS BENEFITS FOR WORKING FOR US AND THEN ALSO JUST DIFFERENT HIRING EVENTS THAT WE HAVE. AND I HAVE FOR EXAMPLE WE'VE ALSO EXPANDED OUR REACH THROUGH IN PERSON AND ONLINE CAREER FAIRS SO OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS WE'VE HELD SEVERAL VIRTUAL CAREER FAIRS FOR CALLOW SHOT THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE AND ALSO THE DIVISION APPRENTICESHIP STANDARDS WHICH HAS ALLOWED US TO CONNECT WITH HUNDREDS OF CANDIDATES TO THE MORE TAX ALL WORK OUT WE DO AS WELL AS THE STATE HIRING PROCESS AN INTERVIEW YES. AND ALSO IN AND TRY TO IMPROVE ACCESS IS. WE ARE YOUR TIES TO MAKING EXAMS MARC SENSIBLE THROUGH AUTOMATION AND BEING ONLINE SO PREVIOUSLY MANY OF THE I. R. AS EXAMS WERE PAPER BASED TODAY MANY POTENTIAL APPLICANTS CAN QUALIFY ONLINE. FOR SOME OF OUR ESPECIALLY HIGH PRIORITY OF POSITIONS SUCH AS THE DEPUTY LABOUR COMMISSIONER. INDUSTRIAL HYGIENIST AND SAFETY ENGINEERS WHICH MAKE THE QUALIFICATION PROCESS A BIT MORE ACCESSIBLE AND EFFICIENT. HI AND LASTLY WE'VE REALLY BEEN EXPANDING OUR USE OF ONLINE ADVERTISEMENT TO DRIVE ENGAGEMENT WITH OUR JOB POSTINGS ON RECRUITMENT SITE. ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS YOUR TO TRY AND BROADEN OUR CANDIDATE POOL I AND THEN JUST LASTLY ON ON THE RETENTION SIDE I JUST LIKE TO SAY IN MY LAST TWO YEARS HERE WITH THE DEPARTMENT I'VE JUST BEEN CONTINUES INSPIRED BY THE TEAMS THAT WE HAVE IN THIS DEPARTMENT WHO DAY TO DAY AFTER DAY CONTINUE TO HELP US MOVE FORWARD OUR MISSION AND SO IT'S FOR THAT REASON THAT WE'VE IMPLEMENTED A STRATEGY TO HELP WITH THE RETENTION OF OUR EXISTING I TEAM THAT INCLUDES THE REESTABLISHMENT OF SUPERIOR ACCOMPLISHMENT AWARDS. I HAD TO RECOGNIZE THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF OUR TEAM MEMBERS ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT WE ALSO THIS IS WHY WE'RE PRIORITIZING THE FILLING OF VACANCIES TO HELP ALLEVIATE THE WORKLOAD ON THE EXISTING TEAMS AND THEN ALSO PROMOTING MOBILITY TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL AS DEPARTMENT Y. JOB OPPORTUNITIES TO ENCOURAGE CONTINUED GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT WITHIN OUR DEPARTMENT. TURNED OFF. HEY I GUESS I'M NOT MOVING TO MASS.

ON THIS ISSUE COLLEGE ARE WITH NO HIRING SOMEONE CHALLENGE NATIONWIDE IN BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS IN LARGE PART DUE TO A COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC SOME PEOPLE OF LEFT THE WORK FORCE AND OTHERS- HAVE RETIRED. HOW IT STARTS TRACKING DATA CLOSELY TO IDENTIFY TRENDS AND THE STATE DEPARTMENT WE HOPE THAT MANY OF OUR PC'S HE'S THE BEST LATER TODAY UNDER ISSUE TWENTY ONE. WELL ASSIST. IN THIS AREA. WE WERE ALSO AFTER A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. MADAM CHAIR REGARDING- COLLEGE DEGREE- AND OTHERS YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO GOING FROM HAPPY TO WAIT- TO SEE IF. THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS. NO ONE TO TOUCH ON THE- AND RESPOND TO THOSE QUESTIONS. SURE TO THE QUESTION OF WHAT IT COLLEAGUES ARE DOING TO REVIEW DEGREE REQUIREMENT FOR STATE HIRING WHEN KELLY JOHN LOOKS AT JOB APPLICATIONS FOR MINIMUM QUALIFICATION UPDATE WE WORK WITH DEPARTMENTS TO DETERMINE WHAT REQUIREMENTS ARE TRULY JOB RELATED. AND LEAD TO SUCCESS IN THE CLASS I THINK TWENTY FOURTEEN COUNTY CHARTER AN ENGAGED IN A NUMBER OF PRODUCTS THAT NOT. MINIMUM QUALIFICATION WHERE YOU HAVE FOUND THAT THE EXISTING MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS OF A FIVE CREATED ARTIFICIAL BARRIERS TO ENTRY ARTICULAR ONLY. RELATED TO GREEN REQUIRE- THE STATE FACES REACH OUT THAT ARE OF. SECTORS ESPECIALLY THAT WERE SPECIALIZED EDUCATION. KNOWLEDGE OUR REVIEWS DEPARTMENTAL REQUIRED TO RE EVALUATE EXISTING MINIMUMQUALIFICATION WHENEVER A DEPARTMENT PROVIDE CALORIE CHART DATA TO INDICATE THANK YOU ARE A POTENTIAL BARRIER- THE HIRING. THAT IS A- THE END OF MY COMMENTS MANAGER AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU OR THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE. SENDER COURTESY WANT TO GO AHEAD AND ASK- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IN IN I JUST WANT TO KNOW AND I'M VERY APPRECIATIVE OF- THE SENATE'S. YOU KNOW SPENDING PLANNER PROPOSAL RELATIVE TO AUG BIDDING- EFFORTS IN THIS AREA- JUST A QUESTION FOR MISS PAYING HIS. WHAT IS THE- OR OR MISTER GROW AND MATURE. BUT DISTINGUISHED TALKING QUITE A BIT ABOUT RETENTION WHAT IS THE CHIEF OBSTACLE OR- M. NOT SURE THE RIGHT WORD IT'S PROBABLY NOT COMPETITOR BUT THE CHIEF COUNTERPOINT TO RETENTION RIGHT NOW- BESIDES JUST. YOU KNOW EFFORT IN AND PROMOTION AND ALL THOSE THINGS THAT WE DO AND WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT- YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE FEELING VALUED IN THE ORGANIZATION ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE OUTSIDE FORCES THAT- JUST MAKING IT. MORE DIFFICULT- PERHAPS A WHAT I HEARD- MAYBE SPOKE ABOUT THAT AND IT WENT OVER MY HEAD. SENATE DEMOCRATS ARE DEPARTMENT INVESTOR RELATIONS I'M HAPPY TO TOUCH ON THAT AND THEN MY COLLEAGUE I COLLEGE ARM MAY WANT. TO ADD A BIT MORE ON THE TREND THAT. THEY'RE SEEN ACROSS THAT. DEPARTMENT BUT JUST IN TERMS OF THE QUESTION ON. WHAT WE'RE NOTICING WITH RESPECT TO RETENTION I IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S JUST NOT UNIQUE TO OUR DEPARTMENT I THINK IT'S HOPPING ACROSS STATE GOVERNMENT AND ALSO JUST HAPPENING ACROSS FOR EMPLOYERS ACROSS THE STATE ACROSS THE COUNTRY OF WE'RE JUST SEEING MORE MOBILITY. AND TERMS OF FOLKS. THAT ARE ARE MOVING IN I'M JOBS AND SO THAT'S NOT. STANDS BY SOMEWHERE WHAT YOU WERE SAYING OUR OUR PRIORITY HAS JUST BEEN WE RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S BEEN A VERY CHALLENGING COUPLE OF YEARS AND LIKE I MENTIONED WE HAVE SOME. REALLY IMPRESSIVE AND DEDICATED FOLKS WITHIN OUR DEPARTMENT AND SO OUR PRIORITY IS JUST TO GET. TO GET MORE HELP THEY ALSO HELP OUR FOLKS WHO ARE WITHIN OUR DEPARTMENT GOT ADDITIONAL TRAINING AND SUPPORTS. AND THEN ALSO SHOW THEM PATHWAYS WITHIN OUR DEPARTMENT THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO LEARN AND GROW. YES IT'S YOU KNOW WE'RE IN A IN A BUDGET COMMITTEE HERE- IN WE HAVE I THINK SOME OF US HAVE OUR OWN. ON GOING TO LIVED EXPERIENCE. WITH RETENTION ISSUES YOU KNOW EVEN AMONG- EVEN IN OUR DEPARTMENT ZERO EVEN AMONG THEIR OWN. STUFF WHICH YOU KNOW PRESSURE SEEMS TO BE OF COURSE THE MACRO ECONOMY AND INFLATION YOU TALK ABOUT THIS BEING. A TREND ALL OVER- I GUESS THE COULD THE CONCERN WOULD BE EVEN WITH THE PROPOSALS THAT ARE ON THE TABLE NOW IS THERE ENOUGH. THERE TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE. I GUESS THAT'S PERHAPS MORE DIRECT QUESTION. AND I'M AND I GUESS I'M IMPLYING THAT THE LACK OF COMPETITION YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF. FOLKS. IT IN TERMS OF PREVENTING AN EXODUS THAT- YOU KNOW- YOU KNOW SALARY AND BENEFIT COMPETITION IS A THING. I MAY HAVE TO ADD. A DEFERRED TO MY COLLEAGUE AT COLLEGE ARE WITHOUT QUESTION GREAT. MISTER GOOD OTHER THAN ARE THE ONLY- INFORMATION I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR IS THAT STUFF I WOULD JUST REITERATE THE CALYX ARE- YOU KNOW THAT WE ARE SEEING THESE ARE HIRING CHALLENGES NATIONWIDE BOTH IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR AS WELL AS THE PRIVATE SECTOR- OR KELLY GEORGE PART- ON THE HIRING PART- WE- HAVE BEEN PROVIDING BEST HIRING PRACTICES TRAINING FOR. HR LIAISON AND HIRING MANAGERS- FACILITATE AND SUPPORT AFTER PARKLAND HIRING PROPERTIES- ON THE RETENTION- PORTION- AS YOU MAY KNOW YOU WE HAVE BARGAINING WITH- UNION FOR- BENEFITS AND OTHER ISSUES. THAT MAY IMPACT- RETENTION. YEAH WE WOULD BE GOOD TO KNOW- MORE SPECIFICALLY IT IN THERE I DON'T THINK I DON'T THINK THAT DRIVES THIS PARTICULAR. BUDGET CONVERSATION RIGHT NOW BUT TO NOTE- IF- YOU KNOW A COMPETITIVE YOU KNOW CONTENT COMPETITIVE COMPENSATION IS IN AND OF ITSELF A NEW ISSUE I MEAN OBVIOUS OBVIOUSLY THE PROBLEM IS- NUMBER ONE- WE WANT PEOPLE TO FEEL THAT- THIS IS THEIR EMPLOYER OF CHOICE RIGHT TO FEEL VALUED IN THERE'S A LOT THAT CAN BE DONE I THINK THAT- WAS WAS BEING DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF JUST. CULTURE BUT IT'S BUT SECONDLY IF WE'RE LOSING PEOPLE AND THAT IN TURN IS FUELING A BACKLOG- IN TERMS OF ABILITY TO DO ENFORCEMENT IN THIS IS REALLY KIND OF A DOUBLE WHAMMY IN IN MY MIND I MEAN WE'RE WE'RE LOSING PEOPLE THAT ARE GOOD PEOPLE TO. OUTSIDE COMPETITION OR WHEREVER THEY'RE GOING PERHAPS INTEREST STATE COMPETITION- YOU KNOW BETWEEN AGENCIES I SUPPOSE I DON'T REALLY I DIDN'T CATCH. IT WE'RE WE THINK FOLKS ARE GOING- BUT WHILE THAT'S HAPPENING A WHOLE. A WHOLE OTHER SET OF EMPLOYEES- YOU KNOW UP AND DOWN THE STATE WHO. ARE ARE WAITING FOR ENFORCEMENT COMPLIANCE OR IMPACTED SO I GUESS THIS IS TO SAY- I THINK WE TAKE THIS VERY SERIOUSLY AND- YOU KNOW PERHAPS ARE IN THE POSITION TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT TO MAKE SURE- YOU KNOW THAT. THE LEGISLATURE'S PROVIDING THE RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE THAT- THAT THEY CHOOSE THE DIR CAN COMPETE- IS NOT ONLY RETAIN BUT BUT COMPETE- SO THAT IT. I DON'T THINK THAT REQUIRES ANY FURTHER RESPONSE BUT- AND ONE EXPRESSED THAT SENTIMENT- IT'S NOT A BLAME FREE. THE A. WHY AREN'T YOU DOING BETTER I THINK WE'RE- WE'VE BEEN AROUND ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT THAT SOMETIMES NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY IF YOU JUST AREN'T COMPETITIVE- EITHER ON ON A LATERAL OR PROMOTIONAL BASIS THAT. IS AN ACCOMPLICE COMPENSATORY BASIS- YOU KNOW WE CAN HAVE A CASCADING IMPACT ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH. AN AGENCY LIKE THIS THAT'S- REALLY DIRECTLY- THE ESSENTIALLY THE ONLY AGENCY THAT CAN HELP FOLKS- YOU KNOW WHO ARE BEING OPPRESSED OR TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF OUT THERE. THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU SENATOR I DO WANT TO DIVE INTO- THE MORE PARTICULARS HERE WITH WITH EACH OF YOU AND- AFTER REPEAT EVERYTHING THAT THIRTY CORTESE FAYE- SAID BUT WE GREATLY APPRECIATE THE WORK OF- ALL THE ALL OF YOU THAT ALL THE CURRENT STAFF DO IT'S CRITICAL. I'VE BEEN A DOING THIS LABOR WORK ALL MY LIFE AND THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ESPECIALLY LOW WAGE LAW LOW PAID. INDUSTRIES WHICH IS WHERE THE MOST EXPLOITATION TAKES PLACE SO I'M VERY VERY CONCERNED- ABOUT THE DIRECT IMPACT THAT THE LACK OF HAVING A SUFFICIENT STAFF IS HAVING ON THOSE OF LOW PAID COMMUNITIES THOSE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES THOSE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES THE FACT THAT THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH COVERT THEY'VE BEEN HIT THE HARDEST. THEY NEED THE MOST ATTENTION THEY NEED THE MOST RESOURCE SO- I KNOW- MAYBE MISTER GHETTO CAN YOU JUST WALK ME THROUGH A SHORT VERSION BUT FROM START TO FINISH UP- FOR PERSON TO BE HIRED IN- DIR. MANAGER I BELIEVE THAT THAT QUESTION IS- THAT'S DIRECTED AT THE I. R. WE HABITS AND LYFT HIRING- STRUCTURE AND THE I. R. DOES THE HIRING DIRECTLY. OKAY NOT SO- UGH CAL HR DOESN'T HAVE A ROLE IN THAT. IN THE HIRING. FIVE YOU KNOW MADAM CHAIR- YEAH THE R. HAS IT I'LL GET IT I DURING A FORTY- THE HIRE EMPLOYEES DIRECT THEMSELVES. OKAY I'M HAPPY TO TAKE THAT QUESTION MADAM CHAIR YES GO AHEAD THANK YOU THANK YES OF COURSE I DEVELOPING I HAD THE I. R. SO AS AS WE MENTIONED DR HAS A TIRING DELEGATION BACK ON THANKS TO THE SUPPORT OF CALLIE CHARGE. AND SO. IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS I SAID D. I. R. WE FOLLOW CALLIE JARS BEST HIRING PRACTICE GUIDELINES AND SO IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT OTHER STATE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS DEAL. BUT BUT I WILL NOTE THAT OUR HUMAN RESOURCES OFFICE THAT'S COMPLETE A REVIEW OF THINGS LIKE A NATIONAL ALLOCATION LEVELS. HELLO AS IN WHICH WE IDENTIFIED THAT THERE WAS A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL CONTROLS AND OVERSIGHT AND SO WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK ON A BUT THAT WITH WITHOUT BEING SAD WE ARE PRO ACTIVELY EVALUATING OUR EXISTING PROCESS TO IDENTIFY AND IMPLEMENT STRATEGIES TO BE MORE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE WE ACTUALLY RECENTLY COMPLETED A PEER REVIEW OF OUR HIRING PROCESS AND WE'RE WORKING ON IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDATIONS SO THAT WE CAN IMPROVE OUR PROCESS IN ADDITION TO LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO AUTOMATE- WHAT IS A LARGELY MANUAL PROCESS CURRENTLY. SO CAN YOU WHAT CAN YOU I'D ASK THIS OF A MISTER GET A LITTLE CAN YOU WALK ME THROUGH THAT START TO FINISH HOW DO YOU FEEL VACANCY. IN TERMS OF THAT BE INCREMENTAL STEPS- TO FILL A VACANCY SO I I'M HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP TO PROVIDE A BIT MORE I CAN GIVE A HIGH LEVEL IN. SOME OF THOSE PIECES LOOK LIKE AND SO IT'S- DIFFERENT LAD AND- IF MY COLLEAGUE AT COLLEGE I WANTS TO JUMP AT A TIME FEEL FREE BUT SO IT CAN LOOK LIKE YOU ARE SUBMITTING A FORM IN WHICH YOU'RE ESTABLISHING A POSITION THAT'S A FORM ONE I'M YOU'RE ALSO THERE'S THE PIECE ON THE PROGRAM SIDE AND THERE'S THE PIECE ON OUR HUMAN RESOURCES OFFICE SIDE YOU ALSO HAVE A DUTY STATEMENT THAT YOU'RE CRAFTING SO ABOUT THAT. ESSENTIALLY. A LIST OF WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT. PLEASE A POSITION IS DOING IN THE DIFFERENT PERCENTAGES OF TIME BUT BUT LOOKS LIKE. ARE YOUR POSTING A JOB AND LOOKING FOR PEOPLE TO APPLY YOUR SCREEN APPLICATIONS JUST MAKE SURE THAT THEY MEET MATH MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS. INTERVIEWING ENOUGH ABOUT THAT SORT OF PROCESS AND THEN YOU COMPLETE SCORING AND SUBMIT A COMPLETE HIRING POCKET. AND THEN THAT'S WHAT GETS REVIEW TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF THE BEST PRACTICES WERE FOLLOWED. WE'VE BEEN OUT WERE ALSO CHECKING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE FOLLOWING THE BEST PRACTICE GUIDELINES RIGHT TO ENSURE ABOUT WHERE WE'RE MEETING BAD EXPECTATION TO FOLLOW THE MERIT BASED HIRING SYSTEM. FIVE THOSE ARE SOME OF THE DIFFERENT I GUESS MILESTONES BUT HAPPY TO CIRCLE BACK WITH WITH YOUR STAFF TO WALK THROUGH WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE MORE OPERATIONALLY. YES IN TO BE CLEAR IN TERMS OF WHERE THE WHERE IS THE POTENTIAL. YOU KNOW ISSUES OR BOTTLENECKS EARTH YOU KNOW AS YOU SAY YOUR DATA EVALUATING- THIS THE PROCESS- TO HIRE- WHAT'S THE ROLE OF THE IR IN. THE DELISSIO ON THE D. O. S. H. HIRING. YEAH OF COURSE I'VE- BEEN A TWENTY YARD SO OUR HUMAN RESOURCE OFFICE AYE SO THE DIVISION OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE AS WELL AS CALLOW SHOWS THAT UNDER OUR DEPARTMENT D. I. R. AND SO WE HAVE A CENTRALIZED HUMAN RESOURCE OFFICE WHICH HELPS GUIDE THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE. AS WELL AS CAL OSHA SUPERVISORS AND MANAGERS ON THE RECRUITMENT HIRING PRACTICES TO ENSURE THAT ALL HIRES ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE STATE'S MERIT BASED PRINCIPLES I HAD AN ALIGNMENT WITH COLLEGE OURS BEST HIRING PRACTICES. SO LIKE I MENTIONED THIS CAN INCLUDE REVIEWING AND APPROVING HIRING PACKAGES WHICH HAS DUTY STATEMENTS ORGANIZATIONAL CHARTS SO THIS IS SHOULD WEAR SHOWS WHERE POSITIONS THAT'S- IN A UNIT FOR EXAMPLE IN WHERE REPORTS TO- JUSTIFICATION MEMORANDUM SCREENING CRITERIA AND ALSO INTERVIEW QUESTIONS AND THEN. ONCE AGAIN IT HAS BEEN SELECTED THAT TEAM ALSO VERIFIES THAT THE CANDIDATE MEETS ALL REQUIREMENTS AND MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS TO ENSURE THAT IT'S A MERIT BASED HIGHER I THINK IN TERMS OF WHAT OPPORTUNITIES WERE FINDING WITHIN THAT PROCESS. I'VE TRIED TO REALLY BRING MORE EFFICIENCIES AND TO BE MORE ACTIVE I THINK WE'RE STILL IN THE EARLY STAGES OF EVALUATING THIS REVIEW IN THE FEEDBACK BUT ALSO HAPPY TO CIRCLE BACK TO TALK A BIT MORE CONCRETELY ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING I'M FLAMAND. BUT WE HAVE BEEN FOR EXAMPLE LIKE I MENTIONED EARLIER TRYING TO PROVIDE MORE RESOURCES TO ENSURE THAT FOR EXAMPLE THERE IS FIVE BUT OUR HIRING MANAGERS HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO ENSURE THEY HAVE THE MOST COMPLETE AND EFFECTIVE DO STATEMENT OR INTERVIEW QUESTIONS. ABOUT THEIR IN ALIGNMENT WITH BEST. THAT YOU HAVE. COULD YOU TALK ABOUT THAT IN TERMS OF EITHER HOW MANY OR- AND I'M PARTICULARLY ARE ASKING ABOUT THAT OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE JUST AS I SAID A LITTLE WHILE AGO. THERE ARE STILL MANY AW INDUSTRIES LOW WAGE INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE LIKELY TO HAVE. OF CLAIMS AND THEIR- DOMINANTLY NON ENGLISH SPEAKING SO HOW DO YOU YOU KNOW HOW ARE YOU ADDRESSING THAT HI WE ADDRESSING THE NEED FOR THAT FROM. UP WORKING CALIFORNIANS OUT THERE WHO ARE YOU KNOW COMING TO YOU FOR HELP. YES OF COURSE THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- MADAM CHAIR JANET PAYING DIR SO ON THE QUESTION OF BILINGUAL POSITION SO WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF MAKING ART DEPARTMENTS WORK MORE ACCESSIBLE AND MEETING WORKERS WHERE THEY ARE. AND SO TECH TO GIVE A BIT OF BACKGROUND I BELIEVE THERE WAS A QUESTION ABOUT FIVE. HOW SOME BACKGROUND HOW BILINGUAL POSITIONS ARE ESTABLISHED SO JUST TO START TO OUR DIVISIONS HAND AND HAVE DESIGNATED SPECIFIC POSITIONS I WAS NEEDING A BILINGUAL SKILLS THAT HOWEVER THERE ARE ALSO POSITIONS AND WHICH ON OUR POSTINGS WE ENCOURAGE OUR RECRUITMENT SPY LINGLE CANDIDATES TO APPLY I JUST TO GIVE AN EXAMPLEON THE FORMER CAL OSHA THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE AND THE DIVISION OF WORKERS COMP ALL RECENTLY ADVERTISED AND RECRUITED FOR EXAMPLE FOR A BILINGUAL OUTREACH AND EDUCATION ANALYST NOT TO HELP YOU WITH FLIGHT OUR DEPARTMENT A MULTILEVEL OUTREACH EFFORTS. I AND JUST TO GIVE SOME MORE INFORMATION SO CURRENTLY ON THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S SIDE WE HAVE SIXTY SEVEN EMPLOYEES THAT ARE BILINGUAL I BETTER DESIGNATED BILINGUAL SO JUSTICE I JUST BECAUSE THERE DOESN'T MEAN THAT DOESN'T MEAN THERE AREN'T OTHERS- AND THEN FIFTY ONE EMPLOYEES AND CAL OSHA- WHO AREN'T RECEIVING THE BILINGUAL PAY DIFFERENTIAL AND SO I ON THE BILINGUAL PAY DIFFERENTIAL AND HOW THAT WORKS I WOULD JUST SAY THAT WE FOLLOW THAT STATE GUIDELINES FOR THE BILINGUAL PAY DIFFERENTIAL SO. FOR EXAMPLE IF A NEW POSITION IS ESTABLISHED AND THE DIVISION SIDE ADDED DIVISION DEMONSTRATES THAT IT HAS TO BE A BILINGUAL POSITION CANDIDATES WOULD NEED TO PASS A LANGUAGE ASSESSMENT AT THE SAME FOR THEIR INCUMBENT EMPLOYEE WHO IS GETTING AB FILING WILL PAY DIFFERENTIAL WE WOULD HAVE TO ESTABLISH THAT THEY'RE USING THEIR BILINGUAL SKILL SET AT LEAST 10% OF THE TIME IN THEIR POSITION AND THEN ALSO THAT DAY THEY MEET THE REQUIREMENTS AS SET BY OUR- STATE GUIDELINES. SO I- IS THAT SIXTY SEVEN FIFTY ONE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS IN THE SCHEME OF THE TOTAL THERE BUT I- I KNOW THERE MUST BE IN SOME POSITION. AND I DON'T KNOW TECHNICAL THE WITH THE CLASSIC IS. BUT THERE MAY BE ON. OF A NEED IN SOME. SOME JOBS THEN THERE IS A OTHER AND SOME OF THOSE THAT ARE DIRECT. MORE DIRECTLY INVOLVED WITH THE PUBLIC OF OR OR WITH THE CLAIMANTS I'M SORRY THEN- THAT MUST BE A MUCH HIGHER PERCENTAGE- AND I KNOW COMING FROM AND WORKING IN THESE INDUSTRIES. THAT OF THE LEVEL OF TRUST. THAT COMES WITH YOU KNOW OF GOING TO OUR AGENCIES. A LOT OF IT DEPENDS ON ARE YOU BILINGUAL ARE YOU BY CULTURAL- THAT GIVES A LEVEL OF TRUST THAT'S NEEDED BECAUSE IT AS WAS SAID EARLIER YOU'RE SO MUCH FEAR. ODD TO- TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE RIGHTS THAT THE WORKERS HAVE SO. HOW DO I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THAT THE NEED HAS ONLY GROWN FOR A BI LINGUAL- BILINGUAL STAFFING HOW DO YOU SEE YOURSELF ADDRESSING THAT GREATER NEED. ALL WERE PUTTING A LOT OF RESOURCES INTO COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT. HOW HOW CAN YOU MEET THAT NEED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR DANCING WITH THE I. R. SO IT OKAY VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT A BIT MORE ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING AN INFORMATION- AND ALSO OUR SERVICES ACCESSIBLE HEAR CALIFORNIANS AND THE LANGUAGE THEY'RE COMFORTABLE SPEAKING ART OR CAN'T SPEAK TO BANG OUT OF THERE MONOLINGUAL. AND SO I ON THE SIDE OF ALSO WE'RE TRYING TO RECRUIT MORE CANDID SIDE MENTIONED AND ESTABLISHING MORE POSITIONS THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED AS BILINGUAL ALSO ENCOURAGING MORE MULTILINGUAL CANDIDATES TO APPLY WE'VE ALSO BEEN TRYING TO ADVERTISE OUR POSITIONS TO. MORE JUST A WIDER BREADTH TO GET MORE DIVERSE CAN ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF CALIFORNIA INCLUDING OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS THAT WE WORK WITH OUR AND OUR WORK. AND I WOULD ALSO JUST LIKE TO NOTE AS WELL BUT IN ADDITION TO HIRING MORE OF. MORE STAFF. THAT HAVE BILINGUAL SKILL SETS WE ARE ALSO ASSESSING OUR CONTRACTED RESOURCES FOR BILINGUAL ACCESS THAT WE HAVE A WORKING GROUP. CURRENTLY INTERNALLY WHERE WE'RE WORKING TO ENSURE THAT ALL OF OUR TEAM MEMBERS HAVE ACCESS EITHER TO AN EMPLOYEE OR SOME KIND OF BILINGUAL TRANSLATION SERVICE VIA PHONE OR EMAIL SO THAT. THAT DOESN'T BECOME A HINDRANCE AS WELL WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE MOREOF OUR ACTUAL MATERIALS AND RESOURCES AVAILABLE IN MORE LANGUAGES AS WELL TO WORKERS. DO YOU HAVE- DO YOU HAVE PARTICULAR GOALS OR TIME FRAME TO REACH THOSE GOALS GOALS IN TERMS OF THE HIRING OF PARTICULAR NINE- NON ENGLISH SPEAKERS BUT JUST OVERALL. YOU MENTIONED- BOMB EARLIER THE LEVEL OF VACANCIES THAT THAT YOU HAVE- WE DIDN'T GET INTO EVERY DETAIL OF THE PROCESS- ALL THE HIRING PROCESS BUT IF WE CONNECT THAT BACK TO THE NUMBER THAT THE VACANCIES AND I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING REALLY HARD BUT THE NUMBER OF VACANCIES THE INCREASED NUMBER OF A NEED FOR NON ENGLISH SPEAKERS HOW DO YOU REALLY HOPE TO- ADDRESS THAT. IN THE STRONGER STINT YOU KNOW WAY POSSIBLE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND I ASK THAT BECAUSE AND CONNECTION ALSO TO THE PROCESS OF HIRING YOU KNOW SOMETIMES AT HIRING COULDN'T GET IN THE WAY OF. HIRING THE GOOD PEOPLE OUT THERE SO I KNOW YOU MENTIONED- EVALUATING YOUR PROCESS BUT- IT SEEMS TO ME WE'VE GOT A- WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE POTENTIAL BOTTLENECKS OUR- TO REALLY ADDRESS THIS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. AND I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND THE URGENCY HERE I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT JUST SPEEDING IT UP FOR THE SAKES OF. OKAY SOMEBODY COULD GET SOMETHING DONE IN A FEW MONTHS EARLIER- MY EXPERIENCES. THIS GOES ON FOR YEARS OF SOMETIMES AND NOT EXACTLY. YOU KNOW I WANNA USE THE EXACT TIME FRAME OF A YEAR WHICH YEARS BUT- OF THAT WAS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WHEN I CAME HERE TO THE LEGISLATURE. HE WAS TAKING YEARS TO GET OF- FOR EXAMPLE WAGE CLAIMS ARE TAKEN CARE OF SO THAT'S NOT EXACTLY THE SITUATION NOW BUT IT COULD BE AND THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF. THANK YOU MADAM. YAKKING DIR AND SO I HEAR YOU AND WE SHARE THAT THE COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE TO HIRE AND RECRUIT MULTI LINGUAL STAFF. I DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE SPIDER-MAN HAPPY TOOK TO FOLLOW UP ON WHY ARE SPECIFIC STRATEGY LOOKS LIKE ASIDE FROM. IT REALLY IS. TRYING TO BE INTENTIONAL ABOUT ARE HIRING AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND WHEN WE'RE PUT IN POSITIONS REALLY EVALUATING THE DIVISION'S EVALUATE. WHAT THE LANGUAGE COMPETENCY IS NEEDED I'M I'M HAPPY TO GO AND LOOK AT WHAT SOME OF OUR RECRUITMENT. ARE IN TERMS OF HOW WE'RE EVALUATING- LANGUAGE ACCESS AND ON THOSE THINGS BUT ALSO IN THE INTERIM AT LEAST WE'RE REALLY DEDICATING TIME AND ENERGY TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE. BETTER RESOURCES AND IN PLACE. ANY OF OUR STAFF THAT NEEDS SOME KIND OF TRANSLATION AND I'VE SERVICE OR ASSISTANCE HABITS AS WELL SO WE'RE TRYING TO JUST TAKE A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH TO ENSURE THAT THAT ACCESS IS AVAILABLE. OKAY I DON'T KNOW IF MR GET RID OF IT IF YOU HAVE ANY THING TO ADD TO MISS THINGS- RESPONSES. YES MADAM CHAIR I THE ONLY THING I WOULD ADD IS THAT ALL STATE AGENCIES ARE CONDUCTING BI ANNUAL SURVEY TO DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF VIOLENCE WILL MEET- AND STAFFING- AT THE NECESSARY IT AGENCIES DEVELOP A PLAN RESPOND TO ANY ARTIFICIAL FEES. I IN IT LOOKS. AND SO THAT IS A- SOMETHING THAT EACH OUR DEPARTMENT BECAUSE IT. MISTER WITH REGARD THE LIVE OF BIG AND DO I ARE- THE IT RANGES FROM APPRENTICESHIP LABOR COMMISSIONER OSHA WORKERS COMP. HOW HOW DOES THAT RANGE IS THAT NOT. OF A RED FLAG IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING THOSE VACANCIES. AT THE END OF YOUR AND YOUR AND YOUR ROLE IN AND YOUR ROLE IN ADDRESSING THAT. R. KELLY CHARCOAL IN IN- IN THAT AREA IS REALLY JUST TO- PROVIDE HIRING PRACTICES TRAINING- TO. THEIR HR LIAISON AND HIRING MANAGERS- MANY THE ITEM- THAT THE I. R. IDENTIFIED- MAKING SURE THAT THEY MEET UP- PRINCIPAL- IS THAT THEY HAVE- I HAVE A PROPRIA TO THE STATEMENT THAT THEY HAVE. A ROBUST RECRUITMENT TOOL AND SO- ON THE DEFICIENCY SIDE BECAUSE THE I. R. HAS. AUTHORITY TO HIRE THAT IS. DIRECTLY. A QUESTION I BELIEVE FOR THE I. R. OKAY OKAY JUST ONE WAS ANOTHER QUESTION I BELIEVE WITH. WAS NEAR OF ROOM. OKAY FORUM- DILISIO IN AND DO ES AGE IS OF THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES OR HOW MUCH TIME IS SPENT ON HIRING- OF HOW MUCH TIME OR HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS ARE SPENT ON HIRING. IN THE END UP PAYING DR JUST A QUICK POINT OF CLARIFICATION MADAM CHAIR YOU YOU MEAN WITHIN OUR HUMAN RESOURCES. NO WITHIN THE DIVISION. OKAY SO LATE LIKE I MENTIONED THERE'S PARTS OF THAT HIRING PROCESS THAT HAPPENED THAT ARE SUPPORTED BY HUMAN RESOURCES OFFICE AND THEN THEY'RE ALSO THAT ARE ON THE PROGRAM SITES THAT WITHIN THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE AND CAL OSHA I DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE BAD HOW OSHA. NUMBER IN FRONT OF ME BUT I CAN AT LEAST SAY ON THE LABOR COMMISSIONER SIDE EIGHT CREATE A HIRING TEAM AND RE DIRECTED SEVENTEEN MEMBERS WHO HELPED FOCUS ON ON HIRING AND DOING THIS HIRING LIAISON ROLE IN ADDITION. YOU HAVE HIRING LIAISONS WHO HELD AT DOING BAG BACK AND FORTH WITH OUR HR TEAM BUT THEN YOU ALSO HAVE HIRING MANAGERS AND IF THE HIRING MANAGERS TO REALLY DO SOME OF THAT HE SAID OF. MAKING SURE THE DUTY STATEMENTS ADDRESS ALL OF THEIR DUTIES THAT THIS POSITION YOU'RE HIRING FOR ENTAILS- THAT WAS ENTERED DEVELOPING INTERVIEW QUESTIONS EXCEPT TRUCK AND SO IT'S A BIGGER NUMBER THAN THAT IN TERMS BECAUSE WE'RE HIRING SO MANY POSITIONS WE HAVE A LOT OF HIRING MANAGERS. WHO ARE PLAYING THAT ROLE AND THEN WE HAVE THOSE HIRING LIAISONS WITHIN THE DIVISIONS AND THEN WE HAVE OUR HUMAN. RESOURCES OFFICE AS WELL KNOWS TRAIN BEGIN A LITTLE BIT MORE BUT- THIS IS AN- AN OVERSIGHT- ITEM AND WANTED TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING BECAUSE IT CONNECTS SO MUCH TO OUR BUDGET OUR INVESTMENT IN- ENFORCEMENT AND COMPLIANCE- AND YOU ALL ARE THE ONES WHO CARRY OUT THIS HARD WORK FOR OUR COMMUNITIES AND IS IT IS- IT IS- VERY VERY HEART BREAKING WHEN WE SEE SO MANY CALIFORNIANS THAT CAN GET PAID SO MANY CALIFORNIANS THAT ESPECIALLY DURING THE PANDEMIC. ALL WORKPLACE HEALTH AND SAFETY WAS COMPLETELY IGNORED WHEN THERE'S SO MANY WORKPLACE ISSUES AND- YOU KNOW WHATEVER WE NEED TO DO AS THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE THE RESOURCES THIS BUDGET- AND ANY OTHER KIND OF RESOURCES. OF WE NEED YOU KNOW WE WANT TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF WHAT THAT NEED IS- THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR WORK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO JUST- SPOKE APPRECIATE YOU VERY MUCH MISS BEING MISTER IVERSON- MISTER GET RATTLE THANK YOU ALL. VERY MUCH AND MISS COLLINS. OKAY WE'RE MOVING ON NOW TO- WE WANT TO LOOK AT A WHOLE THIS ITEM OPEN CONTINUE ON TO A ISSUE. TWENTY TWO. I'M SORRY- OKAY AT THE REAR OKAY ISSUE TWENTY ONE THE SENATE DEMOCRATS PUTTING WELL TO WORK PROPOSALS TO SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS AND- WE WILL BEGIN WITH MR ALAMO FROM THE LA O'S OFFICE. HELLO WITH THE L. A. ON THANK YOU- THIS ITEM- CONSISTS OF TWO COMPONENTS OF THE SENATE BUDGET PLAN RELATED TO SMALL BUSINESS AND NONPROFIT RELIEF. THE FIRST COMPONENT IS A PROPOSAL TO REIMBURSE CERTAIN SMALL BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS FOR THE COSTS- INCREASE PAYROLL TAX COSTS THE RESULT FROM- THE STATE'S NEED TO REPAY FEDERAL LOANS THAT WERE TAKEN DURING THE PANDEMIC I HAD TO KEEP PAYING UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS- SO TELL TO UNPACK THAT A BIT- DURING THE PANDEMIC. AS YOU KNOW THAT THE STATE- YOU I TRUST FUND BECAME INSOLVENT SO THAT THE STATE BORROWED ABOUT TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO KEEP PAYING UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS- UNDER FEDERAL LAW- THE REPAYMENT PLAN. TO REPAY THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THOSE LOANS- IS A INCREMENTAL INCREASE IN THE FEDERAL PORTION OF BUSINESSES YOU I PAYROLL TAXES ARE BEGINNING WITH- I MEAN CREATION OF ONE THIRD. OR THREE TENTHS OF A PERCENT- AND NEXT YEAR AND THEN INCREASE INCREMENTALLY INCREASING UNTIL THOSE LOANS ARE REPAID A CUSTOMARILY THE STATE GENERAL FUND HAS PAIDANNUAL INTEREST ON THOSE FORMS I'M INTO THIS SENATE PROPOSAL. WOULD PROVIDE A- ONE TO ONE. OF THOSE. FEDERAL YOU I CUTS. FOR BUSINESSES AND NOT. BOB THE FIRST YEARS IN INCLUDES LEGISLATIVE AND WHEN TO CONVEY PER THAT DIRECTOR. FOR THE- OF THE FEDERAL LOAN. THE SECOND COMPONENT THIS ITEM- RELATES- I DID RELIEF. FOR SMALL BUSINESSES- WHO HAVE PROVIDED EMPLOYER PAID PAID SICK LEAVE FOR KOBE NINETEEN RELATED REASONS- AS PART OF A- RECENT STATE LAW THAT MANDATED EMPLOYERS PROVIDE THAT PAID COVERAGE- OUR OFFICE HAS NO SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT OF EITHER THE PROPOSALS- WERE SIMPLY ASKED TO DESCRIBE THEM ABOUT HOW TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. CLARIFIER CONTEXTUAL OR- OBVIOUSLY GET BACK TO STAFF WITH WITH ANY ISSUES THAT ARE ARE MORE COMPLEX HAVE ANYONE ELSE SPEAKING ON THIS OKAY OF. MEMBERS. YOUR COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS ARTICLE THING SO THERE'S A REFERENCE IN THE ANALYSIS TO. A TABLE I ASSUME TROUBLE FIND. YEAH SAID JUST FIGURE WITH THE L. A. OSHA'S I IMPORTS COMBINED STATE YOUR TAX LIFE OR OF HAVING TROUBLE FOR. THAT ITEM NUMBER. THREE SURE THAT THERE WOULD A GOOD CONTACT. OKAY. OKAY OKAY HELLO ARE YOU SEE I DO HAVE A QUESTION- YOU KNOW WITH RESPECT TO AID FOR SMALL BUSINESSES HOW WILL THIS OPPORTUNITY- THIS BENEFIT BE PUBLICIZED- IS THERE WILL BE AUTOMATIC OR IS IT IS IT KIND OF IS THE ONUS ON THE BUSINESS TO ACCESS THE RELIEF HOW IT HOW WILL THAT WORK. THIS IS. ON AS I UNDERSTAND IT BUT DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL ARE STILL BEING WORKED OUT- BUT THAT THE INTENT WAS THAT- FOR BOTH THE YOU ARE COST REIMBURSEMENT AS WELL AS THE PAID SICK LEAVE GRANT REIMBURSEMENT THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE IN A DEEP WOULD. INITIATE THOSE PROGRAMS- AUTOMATICALLY RATHER THAN HAVING A BUSINESS NEED TO COME FORTH AND PRO ACTIVELY- REQUEST OR OR MAKE A CLAIM FOR REIMBURSEMENT. THAT THAT'S OCCURRING OBVIOUSLY THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS FROM WE CAN WHEN WE LOOK BACK OVER THE LAST. COUPLE YEARS FISH AND THINGS LIKE WOULD YOU KNOW RENT RELIEF YOU KNOW THAT THAT HAS BEEN A STICKING POINT WHERE UNCLEAR. ESPECIALLY LIKE ACROSS THE CALENDAR LIKE WHEN PEOPLE KNEW ABOUT IT NOW THEY WERE YOU KNOW WELL EQUIPPED TO ACCESS IS TO THE C. THANK YOU. MISTER- I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO WE COULD REMIND ME ONE IS ON AS FAR AS YOU AYE COST. IS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES WITH UP TO FIFTY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EMPLOYEES. AND OBVIOUSLY THAT'S AN EASIER THING IT'S A REBATE SYSTEM. THE RELIEF OF GRANT FOR PAID SICK LEAVE COSTS IS FOR BOTH SMALL BUSINESS AND NONPROFITS UP TO A HUNDRED FIFTY EMPLOYEES. OF AND THAT'S THROUGH A GRANT PROGRAM COULD. OF COULD YOU TALK ABOUT WHY THAT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO I BEEN- APPROACH BY THE NUMBER OF NON PROFITS WERE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE CAP. OF YOU KNOW BEING BEING CAPPED AT A HUNDRED FIFTY EMPLOYEES THEIR NONPROFITS AND SO OBVIOUSLY SEE THEMSELVES AND ALSO THEIR ABILITY TO ACCESS I THINK BECOMES MORE DIFFICULT TO MORE COMPLICATED THEY GO THROUGH A GRANT. OF PROGRAM SO ANY THOUGHTS ON HOW TO ADDRESS THAT YOUR FIRST QUESTION ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATIVE ENTITIES ON FOR THE U. I. COST REIMBURSEMENT THE STATE HAS REPLIED MINISTRY TO ADVANTAGE OF KNOWING A GREAT DEAL ABOUT THE EMPLOYERS YOU WHY COSTS INCLUDING THE INCREASED FEDERAL YOU AYE COST BECAUSE OF THE CLOSE RELATIONSHIP THAT THE EMPLOYER COMMUNITY HAS. WITH THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT WHO OVERSEES THE PROGRAM SO IT'S A NATURAL. PROPOSAL TO HAVE ON THE STATE DIRECTLY TO MINISTER THAT REIMBURSED BACK ON FOR THE PAIN SICK LEAVE. PROVISIONS THAT THERE DOESN'T EXIST THE SAME NATURAL- OVERSIGHT OR ADMINISTERING ENTITY AND THIS IS AS I UNDERSTAND IT THE REASON WHY A GRAND ADMINISTRATOR HAS BEEN PROPOSED- THERE ARE PROS AND CONS WITH WITH GOING FOR THE ADMINISTRATOR BUT I IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH A CLEAR STATE ENTITY- IT'S OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THE- THE- MOST VIABLE ALTERNATIVES. YOUR SECOND QUESTION SENATOR ALSO ABOUT THE- THE SCOPE OF BUSINESS SIZE OR NONPROFIT SIZE IT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR RELIEF THAT REALLY IS A QUESTION FOR THE SUB COMMITTEE AND FOR THE SENATE TO DETERMINE ITS IN IN ITS PRIORITIES. OBVIOUSLY EXPANDING- ABOVE. TO LARGER EMPLOYERS IN IN EITHER PROGRAM WOULD INCREASE STATE COSTS FOR THE GRANTS- WHILE HAVING A MORE RESTRICTED PROGRAM THAT'S MORE NARROWLY TARGETED SMALLER BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS WHICH WOULD DECREASE STATE COSTS RELATIVE TO THE CURRENT PROPOSAL. I MEAN THAT'S REALLY- WILL HAVE A VALUES QUESTION FOR THE SUB COMMITTEE AND HOW IT FITS INTO THE BROADER SENATE BUDGET- OUR PORTFOLIO AND PLAN. YEAH OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WORSE YES SENATE COURTESY. YEAH THEN I APPRECIATE THE EXPLANATION ON THE DIFFERENCE IN ADMINISTRATION AND IT IT DOES- NO OCCURRED TO ME THAT. JUST BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE RELIEF ON PAID SICK LEAVE- THAT THE ONLY EMPLOYER WOULD WOULD REALLY KNOW AND BE ABLE TO CERTIFY- YOU KNOW WHAT THEIR OUT OF POCKET ON HOW MANY EMPLOYEES HAVE ACTUALLY. IF YOU WILL STEP FORWARD AND CLAIM THAT KIND OF RELIEF- SO IT'S- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY SOME OF THE SAFEGUARDS IN IMPLEMENTATION THE ADMINISTRATOR GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT- YOU KNOW ALL THAT'S DONE- WITH USUAL SAVE CARS IN A PENALTY OF PERJURY AND- YOU KNOW PROP PROTECTION AND EVERYTHING ELSE BUT- BUT IT IT IT WOULD BE PRETTY IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE EMPLOYER. FOR THE STATE TO KNOW. YOU KNOW WITHOUT SOME KIND OF A SURVEY OR SOMETHING WHO. EVEN YOU KNOW WHAT. THE MAGNITUDE OF THESE CLAIMS ARE GOING TO BE OVERALL UNTIL THEY START COMING IN SO LIKE I GET IT I A GRANT PROGRAM IS NOT AS ATTRACTIVE AS- AS YOU KNOW SORT OF AUTOMATED WAY THAT THE U. I. IS GOING TO BE HANDLED BUT- YOU KNOW I'M NOT SURE EITHER. I CAN COME UP WITH A BETTER. BUT A WAY OF DOING THAT- AS WE SEE HERE TODAY. I DO SUPPORT BOTH ITEMS I SUPPORT EVERYTHING IN THIS ITEM- YOU KNOW HOW 2% YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF THE NEED IN TERMS OF THE BUDGET. BUDGET PRIORITY AND- I KNOW OF. SEVERAL BUSES IT PROBABLY ACTUALLY THE SAME COHORT APPEAR ON THIS PANEL BEEN PRETTY VOCAL ABOUT. MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S RELIEF- FOR THE SMALL BUSINESSES IT LEAST AS DEFINED HERE- BUT WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE HARDSHIP ALREADY SO WHATEVER WHATEVER'S HAPPENING OUT THERE N TERMS OF REIMBURSEMENTS NEEDED IT'S SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH OF BECAUSE WE'RE HEARING. FROM CONSTITUENCIES FROM EMPLOYERS THAT IT'S HURTING- IT'S PUTTING A REAL HURT ON ON ON SMALL BUSINESSES OUT THERE AND OF COURSE IF THAT'S- NOT RELIEVED SOMEHOW- YOU RISK OF SOME SORT OF YOU KNOW INSOLVENCY OR LAYOFFS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHICH IN TURN- GOES BACK IT HURTS THE EMPLOYEES THEMSELVES- KIND OF DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF THE PAID SICK LEAVE IN THE FIRST PLACE SO. I'M ALL FOR IT- I HAD NOT HEARD OF BILL IS MUCH OF. FROM THE NONPROFIT COMMUNITY- CHAIRED RUSSELL AND WHICH IS AMAZING BECAUSE WE HAVE SUCH OF. THE NETWORK OF. ACTIVE IN SOMETIMES SIZABLE NONPROFITS- IN MY COUNTY SO- HOPEFULLY WE CAN HELP- YOU KNOW HOW FIGURE OUT. WHAT THE NEED IS THERE AND IF THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME KIND OF- THE SPECIAL OUTLET FOR THEM- I'VE I THINK WITH- THE FOR PROFIT EMPLOYERS. BUT WE'VE HEARD PRETTY CLEARLY THAT HUNDRED FIFTY IS A PRETTY GOOD CUT OFF BUT DUMP. THEM I I'D I'D LIKE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THAT I'M SURE WE WILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANKS RECENT QUESTION. OKAY THANK YOU I ALSO THE OTHER THING I APPRECIATE ABOUT THESE TWO IS THAT IT'S UP TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EMPLOYEES- UP TO A HUNDRED FIFTY EMPLOYEES VERSUS THE OTHER WAY WHICH WAS. THE HIGHER ALL INCLUSIVE DOWN TO TWENTY FIVE AND SO THOSE WHO ARE UNDER TWENTY FIVE WERE WERE LEFT OUT OF RELIEF IN THE PAST- AND- IS THERE A WAY OF. GENERALLY CALCULATE MISTER ALAMO IF WE WENT FROM WITH THE NONPROFIT'S NOT WITH THE FOR PROFIT BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS WE WOULD HIGHER. IS THERE SORT OF A- A WAY TO GENERALLY CALCULATE LIKE UP TO FIVE HUNDRED IF YOU'RE A NONPROFIT OR NO CAP IF YOU'RE NONPROFIT HOW HOW DO YOU BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THIS COMES DOWN TO WHERE WE GONNA PUT. THE FUNDS THAT WE HAVE. MADAM CHAIR- IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS WE WOULD LIKE IT TO BE- WE'D BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH WITH- THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT ON I'M GATHERING SOME DATA AND THINKING ABOUT IT WANT ONE. KEEP CONSIDERATION NONPROFIT SECTOR IS THAT. AS YOU KNOW MANY NONPROFITS DIRECTLY REIMBURSE FOR THEIR YOU AYE COSTS- AND SO. DOES NONPROFITS. WOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO THE INCREASE FEDERAL YOU MIGHT TAXES NUMBER NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THIS GRANT PROGRAM SO THAT. THE SUBSET OF NON PROFITS THAT THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE HIS PHYSICAL RELATIVELY SMALL PORTION- I SAID ONLY TO. HELP PUT SOME. A. B. CONTACT ON THE ORDER OF ADDED TO- IT'S NOT WORK A PARTNER AND GET SOMETHING MORE KIND BACK TO OKAY THANK YOU MOVE ON OUT LEAVE THAT OPEN.

HEY I THINK I ANSWERED ALL OF YOU KNOW I DID I DIDN'T DIDN'T EXPECT ANSWERED ALL BUT A DONE GONE GLAD TO HEAR THAT IT'S CONSIDERED- YEAH AND I GUESS YOU KNOW I'M I'M STILL. KIND OF INTERESTED IN THIS QUESTION OF WHAT WE KNOW WHAT IS THE STANDARD OF THE END OBJECTIVE THAT THAT'S- A QUANTIFIABLE YOU KNOW BY WAY OF- YOU KNOW THE MEASURE TO IMPROVEMENT. AND THEN I TO TERRY QUESTION TO BE YOU KNOW WHICH IS ABOUT OUTRAGE YOU KNOW HOW HOW. HOW DO YOU. JOBS J. YOU KNOW GET CLASSIC- CAL. AND WHAT'S THE IN TERMS TO MAKE THAT BETTER- TO BETTER. UP FOR SHE WOULD TO A- DIVERSE PERSPECTIVES. THANK YOU AT NEWMAN FOR THE FALL UP- FIRST I WOULD NOTE THAT THE- IS- THESE IT WE HAVE A FRONT THAT SO AGES IN THE- ARE- I HAVE- HIRING. I ADD THAT- MANY OF THE DATA- FUNDING THAT WE'RE REQUESTING TO CALIFORNIA LEADS WOULD. BE DOCTOR TO SPECIALLY IN TARGETED TARGETING- APPLIQUE. SO CHARACTER YEARS IMPROVE IN TO. THE AT HALF DATA COLLECT- AND ANALYSIS WE ARE YOU CAN JUST ANALYZING THE INFORMATION WE CURRENTLY HAVE- WILL HOPEFULLY HELP APARTMENT- BETTER TARGET- DIFFERENT COMMUNITY. THANK YOU MR CENTER BECAUSE HE HERE ARE THE AT THE RISK OF SOUNDING CRITICAL AND I DON'T. YEAH I'M I'M GOOD THIS IS GOING FORWARD BUT- I THINK. THE OUT REACH QUESTION IS- IT I I'M NOT HEARING THE ANSWER THAT I WAS HOPING I WAS GOING TO HEAR FROM CENTER NEWMAN'S QUESTION WHICH- IT IT IT FEELS LIKE. THE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE SYSTEM THOSE FOR- ON WHAT I WOULD CALL THE PASSIVE SIDE OF THE SYSTEM- IN IT MAY NOT BE THE CASE MAYBE IT'S JUST NOT IN OUR YOU KNOW ON OUR REPORT HERE RECEIVE- IN WRITING OR ORALLY- BUT THE POINT OF COURSE OF. THE WEBSITE- CENTRALIZED OR DECENTRALIZED I DON'T I DON'T THINK CAL HR LEADERS PREFER COLLEGE OR TO SAY. YOU KNOW OUT REACH- ON THIS IS GOING TO BE DECENTRALIZED THE QUESTION WAS BUT OUR REGION ABOUT REACHES CAN BE DECENTRALIZED AND WE'RE WAY WAY OFF I THINK WHERE WE WANT TO BE THAT'S- GROUP THAT'S GONNA BE COMPLETELY COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. I THINK THE WHOLE POINT HERE. IF YOU KNOW OF. YOU KNOW THE DIRECTION THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO GO IS TO. IS TO DRIVE IMPLEMENT IN A MORE DIVERSE MANNER WHICH MEANS DRIVE PEOPLE TO THE WEBSITE. HOPEFULLY A WEBSITE THAT WORKS BUT HOPE DRIVE PEOPLE TO THE WEBSITE FROM FROM EVERY SECTOR EVERY DEMOGRAPHIC- YOU KNOW ESSENTIALLY A UBIQUITOUS WAY. IN THAT HAS TO BE DONE TO CENTRAL IS WHERE IT IS. YOU KNOW CERTAINLY DEPARTMENTS AND DIVISIONS CAN GIVE INPUT AS TO- IN IT WOULD HAVE TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE OUT REACHES. AS IS EFFECTIVELY DESCRIBING THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE- BUT. YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY. YOU KNOW HE DOES NOT TO BUT- I. PART OF WHAT I'M HEARING THE L. A. C. IS. YOU KNOW GET REPORTS BACK ON THIS LEGISLATURE YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT THINGS LIKE THAT IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT HOW. A PROGRESSIVE WERE AFFIRMATIVE THE OUR REACH IS GOING TO BE IN A USE THAT WORD IN THE LAYMAN'S CONTEXT WHEN IS THE AFFIRMATIVE BUT HOW HOW AGGRESSIVE IN AFFIRMATIVE IS IT COULD BE. AN PLEASURE TO BEGIN REPORTS BACK- SO THAT WE CAN REVISIT THIS SO WE DON'T GET DOWN SEVENTY YEARS DOWN THE ROAD IN ESSENTIALLY HAVE HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM- IT I THINK THE OTHER THING THAT IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO REVIEW IS NOT ONLY. HAS TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THE RECRUITMENT IS BECOMING MORE DIVERSE WITHIN OUR PEOPLE WHO COME IN THROUGH THAT EXPANDED THE FIRST RECRUITMENT PROCESS BEING TAPPED ON THE SHOULDER THE MANAGEMENT OPPORTUNITIES YOU KNOW AS IN EIGHT A YOU CAME IN THREE YEARS AGO THROUGH THIS PROGRAM- IN. WE'D LIKE TO HAVE YOU- YOU KNOW BURN IT TO CERTAIN PEOPLE BECAUSE WITHOUT THAT THERE'S NO UPWARD MOBILITY IN TERMS OF FUTURE. DIRECTORS AND- ADMINISTRATORS AND PEOPLE WHO BASED THE ARE CALLING THE SHOTS SO I THINK ALL OF THAT IS POLICY OF THE FORGET THE FUN THIS. IS A LEGISLATURE WE SHOULD BE SAYING WE'D LIKE TO COME BACK AND REVIEW THE IMPLEMENTATION SIDE OF IT TO MAKE SURE IT'S IT REALLY IS. GOING IN THE- FROM APOLLO STAMP THAT WE LIKE TO GO SO. YOU MIGHT. CAN THE SOME CARE IF I MAY- UP HELLO YES COURSE. DEPARTMENT CURRENTLY REQUIRED TO HAVE A PLAN TO INCREASE UPWARD MOBILITY FOR STATE WORKERS AND LITTLE THINGS THAT THEY SHOULDN'T. RETIRING OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. ADDITIONALLY COUNTY CHAR LACKS THE STAFF OF THE DATA WE HAVE ACCESS TO ANY INFORMATION WE WANT TO GATHER TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS. WITH A FUNDING CHARACTER WILL BE ABLE TO ANALYZE DATA DATA TO BETTER INFORM OUR POLICIES AND PROGRAMS. AND HEALTH DEPARTMENTS DO THE THING. FOR EXAMPLE THE DATA RESOURCES- THAT I MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY WOULD ALLOW KELLY CHART AND EMPOWERMENTS TO ENHANCE THEIR PLANT- THEIR CURRENT PLANS- AND- LOOK AT ADDITIONAL TARGETED. RECRUITING. THE TWO THAT YOU'RE THAT'S THAT'S APPRECIATED I'D I JUST. MY SENSE IS MY FEELING IS AFTER HEARING ALL THIS THAT. THERE NEEDS TO BE A GREATER EMPHASIS ON. WHAT YOU WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT AT THE END THERE IN TERMS OF- THE TARGETED RECRUITMENT. WE ARE WE'RE IN A WORLD OF DATA AND AGGREGATED DATA AND EVIDENCE BASED DATA AND ALL THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO SEE THE DATA THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING WHAT THE DATE IS GOING TO SHOW WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW IF THERE'S IF THERE'S NO EFFECTIVENESS IN THE OUTREACH FIVE YEARS FROM NOW IT'S GOING TO. IS GONNA BE GREAT DATA BUT THIS IS GOING TO SHOW SAME OLD SAME OLD- DIFFERENT YEAR SAME RESULTS IN LESS THE OUTREACH IS REALLY EFFECTIVE SO PERHAPS WHAT I'M ASKING FOR IS. YOU KNOW THE ASSURANCE THAT WHAT WE'RE REALLY DOING HERE IS DRAMATICALLY ALTERING BOTH THE- THE INVESTMENT IN AND THE AND THE CULTURE AROUND- DIVERSE RECOUP RECRUITMENT IN IN. IT TARGETING IS OKAY I JUST WANNA SAY THIS OUT LOUD BUT THE WORLD OUT THERE IS ALREADY DIVERSE IF YOU DO COMPREHENSIVE UBIQUITOUS OUT REACH YOU GENERALLY WILL GET- DIVERSE A DIVERSE APPLICATION POOL IN IT SO HE- YOU KNOW I'M I'M NOT HOLDING MYSELF ALL ITEMS ACT AS AN EXPERT ON THIS BUT THE EACH. ONE OF US UP HERE IN. ASSEMBLY ANY WOULD CARDUS A THEIR BACK WAS IN LEAD TO. RIGHT NOW HAS THE SAME TASK YOU KNOW EVEN IN THE MICRO LEVEL OF RECRUITING ARE ON STAFF AND WE KNOW WHEN WE GO OUT.

DEMOCRATIC ALLIANCE HAS TO BE ENGAGED IN IN HOUSE BE TOUCH MULTIPLE TIMES WITHOUT REACH. AND THEN THE HIRING POOL. WILL BE WHAT YOU WANTED TO BE TO THERE'S A COST COMPONENT TO OUR REACH RIGHT WHICH BE CONSIDERED. MOVING FORWARD AND I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S BEEN CENTRAL TO THIS CONVERSATION BUT THE E. NOTED THAT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES IN. HIRING AND RECRUITMENT ISSUES BRANDON MARKETING. BY MR ARE YOU YOU MEANT- AND EMPHASIS ON DATA- YOU KNOW TO INTERNALLY TO MAKE SMART DECISIONS- I I'D SUGGEST AS YOU DO THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL- CUT ALONG THE WAY PER. SECRETARY'S COMMENTS TO DEVELOP A DASHBOARD. WHERE YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE ALSO HAVE SOME INSIGHT. INTO THAT DATA OVER TIME INTO ADDITIONAL WE CAN GAUGE.
