IN CALIFORNIA STUDENT AT ALICE YEAH I IMPACTS NEARLY FOUR MILLION PEOPLE WITH A COLLECTIVE. HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT OWED RIGHT HERE IN THE GOLDEN STATE ALONE THE AVERAGE- CARRIES MORE THAN THIRTY SEVEN. THOUSAND DOLLARS. THAT AND THEN FIVE HOURS ARE BEHIND ON THEIR STUDENT LOAN.

BUT NINETY NINE. 99% THIS WILL I. SERVICE LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAM WERE REJECTED THIS IS AN ACCEPTABLE AND IT REALLY HIGHLIGHTS THE URGENCY FOR CALIFORNIA TO ACT IN FOR CALIFORNIA TO STEP INTO THIS GAP AND DEMONSTRATE LEADERSHIP AND I IN THIS AREA AND TO DEVELOP SOLUTIONS IN THIS AREA WHICH IS WHY WE ARE HERE I TODAY WILL BE ON HOUSING HOW STUDENT THAT IS A IN LOCAL EIGHTIES TODAY. EFFECTIVELY TEEN ECONOMIC PROSPERITY FOR SOME OF OUR MOST SMALLER.

ARE WITH THAT I AM VERY PLEASED TO WELCOME FOR THAT. PRESS I DID INCREASE SOME OF THAT EXTRA I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME LINDA H<U>&LT;C.CYAN&GT; WHO IS. A&LT;/C&GT;</U> DRESSY WITH PASADENA CITY COLLEGE LINDA THINK. NOT I WOULD ALSO DO WELL. THREE XIN POLICY THE EIGHT COMMISSION AND LASTLY ALEX A KEY C. N. ARE THE STUDENT TRUSTEE FROM PASADENA CITY COLLEGE THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE THIS MORNING AND TIED FOR SHARING YOUR PERSPECTIVES WITH FAST. WITHOUT LINDA WOULD LOVE TO KICK OFF WITH YOU. THANK YOU YEAH I THINK WE'RE WE'RE FORTUNATE IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE LEGISLATORS REALLY UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION- IN OUR OUR STATE SO WE'RE ONE OF THE FEW STATES THAT ACTUALLY CARRIES THE COST OF STUDENTS. TUITION IN CALIFORNIA MANY COLLEGE WE HAVE A FAIRLY LOW RATE FOR ON CALIFORNIA'S STUDENTS EVEN AT THE SEASON C. S. USE. NEVER THE LESS WE SEE ON THE STRUGGLE FOR STUDENTS. SO UNDER THE AS DR JOHN IS THAT I PARTICIPATE- I AM THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRUSTEES SAYS XIN TWENTY ONE OF A SELECTIVE PROCESS STATE- AND LAST YEAR WE IMPLEMENTED I'M ARE WE INITIATED TO TASK FORCES TO AT THE- INSISTENCE FACE AND- FELT. THAT ARE GETTING IN THE WAY OF STUDENTS BEING ABLE TO SUCCEED I WAS HEADED BY DR KEITH CURRY OF COMPTON DR PAMELA SKIN OF SAN DIEGO. AND I CO CHAIRED THE FINANCIAL AID TASK FORCE- AND I CALLED THE ONE POINT OH TASK FORCE BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH TO LOOK AT AND SO MANY THREATS TO CONSIDER. I'M SO WE FOCUSED ON. THE RESEARCH. CALIFORNIA AND WHAT CAN WE DO TO. MORE AVAILABLE TO OUR STUDENTS. SO IS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAID I MEAN THERE'S POSSIBILITY THERE'S LOTS OF SOLUTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT OUT BUT WHY ARE THEY BEING IMPLEMENTED AND WHY ARE NICE FOR STUDENTS NOT GETTING ACCESS TO IT. SO ONE OF THE THINGS WE LOOKED AT WAS- THE FINANCIAL AID ACCESS FOR STUDENTS. AND HOW IS THAT HOW IS THAT EMPLOYMENT AND HOW MANY OF OUR STUDENTS ARE ACTUALLY GETTING TO IT. I'M THERE. AND REPORT- IT WAS A LITTLE DAUNTING HOW WE ACTUALLY JUST PRESENTED THE RIVERSIDE CONFERENCE. I WAS PROUD BUY TICKETS CALLED GREEN LIGHT RED TAPE ABOUT FINANCIAL AID AND WHAT HE DID WAS HE TALKED ABOUT BARRIER. BETTER BUSINESS FROM GETTING THE FINANCIAL AID THAT'S ON THE TABLE. WHAT ARE FINANCIALLY TASK FORCE IT IN THIS WAS ACTUALLY INITIATED BY FRENCH LATEX. OFFICERS ACROSS THE STATE. WAS IDENTIFIED OVER A HUNDRED BEST PRACTICES THAT COULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE OPERATION WITHOUT ANY LEGISLATIVE CHANGES. THAT WITH JAZZ NOT DOWN THESE BARRIERS. SO ONE OF THE FINANCIAL AID OFFICERS CAME UP WITH THE TAGLINE I DON'T KNOW IF ITS ORIGINAL BUT I LIKED IT IT WAS. DOUBT COULD GIVE IT. BUT YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS WE RECOGNIZE THE FINANCIAL AID OFFICERS HAVE SO MUCH THEY FEEL BURDEN OF LIABILITY AND PROTECTING THE COLLEGES LIABILITY FROM NOT. DOTTING ALL THE I'S AND CROSSING OF THE TEASE AND SO YOU CAN ASK THEN LOTS OF QUESTIONS BUT WHEN ESPECIALLY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT STUDENTS WHO HAVE OUR FIRST AND STUDENTS TO COLLEGE NOT HAD- THIS DISTANCE AND SUPPORT THEY NEED IF NOT ALL THIS PAPERWORK WE ARE UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS IN OUR SYSTEM. I FELT PRESS PHOTO SELECT RIGHT. THE MONEY GETS LEFT TABLE THAT REALLY SHOULD BE IN THE HANDS FOR STUDENTS I'M REALLY PROUD THAT WE PUT OUT A FRAMEWORK DOCUMENT. REALLY REALLY SPEARHEADED BY FINANCIAL AID THERE REALLY CHANGES THE CULTURE. OF THE- OF HOW WE OPERATE ON OUR CARS COLLEGES AND IT REALLY SHOULD BE STUDENT CENTERED BUT SHOULD OPERATE LIKE A CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER. WE SHOULD BE LOOKING HOW WE PUT. THIS YEAR SERVICE WHEN YOU LOOK AT PRIVATE COLLEGES THAT'S WHAT THEY DO ONE OF THE FOUR LAKES OF GOING AFTER STUDENTS IS YOU KNOW HOW TO GET THEM TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD EDUCATION. IN CALIBRATING BECAUSE WE TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THAT CAN THAT. CAN IS LOW. WE DON'T WE DON'T MAKE THAT ONE OF OUR OUR- OUR MAJOR POINTS AND SO I THINK THAT WE DO NEED TO CHANGE OUR FOCUS ON THAT- I GET THE SIX LEGISLATORS DONE A GREAT JOB IN HELPING US TO GET. TO SEE. YOU BOB. TO BE ABLE TO HELP OUR STUDENTS BUT WE ALSO NEED TO. NOT DOWN THE BARRIERS SO I THINK. AREAS THAT THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT ONE IS THE LEGISLATIVE CHANGES I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE- ONE OF THINGS WE LOOK AT IN AFFORDABILITY OF FIRST POLICIES IS THERE THERE'S A GREAT DISPARITY. IN THE- FOR THE FOR YOUR STUDENTS VERSUS THE TO YOUR STUDENTS SO WHILE WE HAVE LOW TUITION. THE COST OF- JUST BEING ABLE TO LIVE TO GET TO SCHOOL IS SO HIGH FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WHEREAS EVEN AT. THE COST OF EDUCATION IS HIGHER FOR THE FOR YOUR STUDENTS THEY HAVE ACCESS TO OTHER FORMS OF FINANCIAL AID THAT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE PROFANITY HAVING. SO WHAT ARE THINGS WE TALK ABOUT ALSO ACROSS. AT THE SYSTEM WIDE LEVELS HOW DO WE CREATE SORT OF WHAT IS THE BASS LINE THAT IS NEEDED FOR ALL STUDENTS JUST TO GET THROUGH SCHOOL AND THEN HOW DO WE EQUALIZED- THE ACCESS TO RESOURCES FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME THAT- FOR YOUR STUDENT. WE RECOGNIZE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE STUDENTS WHO FOR YEARS TO- BE ABLE TO GET FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR THEIR THING- DON'T THINK THAT'S NECESSARY FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE WE THINK THEY'RE ALL OF HOME BUT IN REALITY. NO THEY'RE NOT AND A LOT OF THEM. TO READ THE SEE. A LOT OF RETURNING STUDENTS WE HAVE STUDENTS WHO ARE WORKING JOBS WHO ARE TRYING TO GET THROUGH THEIR EDUCATION SO I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT- HOW THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF CHANGE FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS. AND THEN EQUALIZE FROM THAT ACTS. SOME CHANGE IN OUR LEGISLATION IT NEEDS TO BE SOME CHANGE IN OUR CULTURE. I RECENTLY- SENATE BILL TWO NINETY ONE AND GOT. US THROUGH WORD EIGHT IT INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WAS BEING GIVEN TO STUDENTS WHICH- I REALLY APPLAUD LEGISLATORS ARE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATORS AGAIN FOR THAT. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO CHANGE THE PELL GRANTS THERE'S SO MANY RESTRICTIONS ON THAT IT'S SUCH A DAUNTING PROCESS FOR STUDENTS TO GO THROUGH. AND ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN. BEFORE AND AFTER FALLOUT MOUNDS OF PAPERWORK- AND RECENTLY ONE OF THINGS WE DID AND IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM UNDER THE JOINT CAUCUSES WHICH ARE AT THE ASIAN AMERICANS AFRICAN AMERICANS LATINOS IN THE VETERANS. IS WE PUSH FOR THE SEGREGATION OF THE DATA SO. MANY TIMES AND WE FEEL THAT ESPECIALLY IN THE ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITIES BECAUSE- OFTEN WE THINK ASIAN AMERICANS. NO NO PROBLEM GREAT STUDENTS MODEL MINORITY. BUT IT'S NOT. SO MUCH IN THIS GROUP THERE'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT SUBGROUPS IN ASIAN AMERICAN JUSTICE WE SEE AN AFRICAN AMERICANS NOW THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF CHANGING. AND THE LATINOS IT'S NOT ALL NOT EVERYBODY COMES MEXICO THEY COME FROM ALL OVER FROM DIFFERENT AREAS AND SO NOW WE'RE JUST AGGREGATING THE DATA SO THAT WE CAN START TO DO IS TO UNCOVER. SOME OF THOSE GROUPS THAT HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN HIDDEN MARK YOU SO THAT WE CAN BETTER SERVE PROCESS- NEED ACCESS. SO PAPA ONE OF THIS PART OF THIS IS LEGISLATION THE OTHER TASK FORCE I FOR SERVED ON THREE YEARS AGO- THERE'S BEEN CHANGING HAS BEEN THE- WORK. THAT'S WHERE HE- YES WHEN I RAN FOR THE COLLEGE BOARD I ALWAYS BELIEVE THAT. NOT COMING TO COLLEGE JUST TO GET AN EDUCATION TO HAVE A PIECE OF PAPER IN YOUR HAND YOU CAME TO COLLEGE TO GET THAT PIECE OF PAPER BECAUSE YOU BELIEVED IT WAS A KEY FOR YOU TO GET A BETTER JOB. AND THAT I THINK IS THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF EVERYONE SO THIS BIFURCATION WE SEE IN OUR OWN EDUCATION SYSTEM OF HOW WE BY FOR KATE A STUDENT WHO IS GOING FOR WORK. CAN AGREE YOU'RE GETTING A CERTIFICATE VERSUS ONE WHO'S GETTING A FOUR YEAR DEGREE AND BEING ABLE TO TRAVEL ALL THE WAY ON THAT FOUR YEAR I'M TRAJECTORY IS OP I THINK THAT MEANS WE NEED TO THE LINES ARE. TRULY IN REAL LIFE BEING BLURRED AND WE NEED TO ACCEPT THAT IT'S REALLY THE SAME STUDENT THEY JUST HAVE. TAPPED FOR TIMELINES BUT THEY'RE ALL GOING TO GET TO US. WE ALL WE WANT THEM TO ALL GET TO A PLACE OF SUCCESS. WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE RESOURCES THAT WE OFFER IN THE CURRICULUM THAT WE HAVE. IN COLLEGE- NEEDS TO LEAD TO THAT SUCCESS. SO PART OF THAT IN ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE BEEN A VERY STRONG ADVOCATE OF IS- X. MUCH STRONGER PARTNERSHIPS WITH HER OWN INDUSTRY. I THINK WE HAVE TO ACCEPT INDUSTRY AS- PARTNERS IN DEVELOPING CURRICULUM. AND I ALSO THINK THAT WE NEED TO ACCEPT- WE NEED TO WORK MORE CLOSELY WITH INDUSTRY TO PROVIDE. INTERNSHIPS JOB EXPERIENCE FOR OUR STUDENTS. FOUR AND THEN FOR. WHAT YOU GET FROM TO GET THAT CERTIFICATE OR WOULD YOU GET THAT DEGREE HOW DOES THAT LEAD YOU DIRECTLY INTO A JOB AND A GOOD PAYING JOB WHEN ONE THAT- HELPS YOU THEN PUT INTO PRACTICE THOSE THINGS YOU FOR THE CLASS SO THAT THE TWO FOCUSES I THINK ARE REALLY IMPORTANT. THANK YOU AND- GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU CHAIR FOR- ASSEMBLING THIS HEARING ON THIS TOPIC MY NAME IS PATRICK PERRY AND I AM CURRENTLY THE- CHIEF OF POLICY RESEARCH AND DATED OF IT FOR THE CALIFORNIA TO NAY COMMISSION AND I CAN PROBABLY SAY I. FOR MANY MANY YEARS THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM AND AT THE CSU SYSTEM SO I'VE- BEEN AROUND THE BLOCK. WE GIVE YOU A GENERAL OVERVIEW OF SEIZE WE ADMINISTER THE STATE'S FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM THE STATE HANDS OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN TWO BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF INSULATE EVERY YEAR THROUGH THE GRANT PROGRAM- AND WERE WERE VERY LUCKY THAT WE ARE IN A STATE THAT IS PROVIDING ALL THIS FINANCIAL AID AS FAR AS A- AN ACTUAL GUARANTEED PROGRAM IT'S AN ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM WHICH IS. SOMETHING YOU DON'T SEE. FORTY NINE STATES. AND AS SUCH CALIFORNIA DOES HAVE I'D SAY THE MOST ROBUST AND PROGRESSIVE FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRY. IN TERMS OF SUPPORTING LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME STUDENTS. AROUND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY ONE THOUSAND STUDENTS RECEIVED A CAL GRANT LAST YEAR. DISCOVERED THEIR FULL SYSTEM WIDE TUITION AND FEES FOR STUDENTS ATTENDING UIUC OR SEE ISSUE. AND OF COURSE TUITION FOR STUDENTS ATTENDING PRIVATE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. AND THEN ABOUT ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND STUDENTS LOW INCOME STUDENTS RECEIVED A CAL GRANT ACCESS AWARD- OF APPROXIMATELY SEVENTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS TO HELP OFFSET THE COST OF BOOKS SUPPLY. AND ROOM AND BOARD HELP HOLD THAT NUMBER. YOUR HEAD AND IT ACTUALLY. FOR THE ACTUAL REAL COSTS. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THE CALIFORNIA- SUPPORTS UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS THE CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT APPLICATION ALLOWS ELIGIBLE UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS TO ACCESS STATE FINANCIAL AID WHICH IS GREAT ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THEY ARE UNABLE TO ACCESS FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID OR FEDERAL WORK STUDY PROGRAMS. NOW ONE THING ABOUT CAL GRANT IS THAT ITS FOCUS VERY SQUARELY ON TUITION ASSISTANCE- AND THIS IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN ACCUMULATION OF STUDENT DEBT INSOFAR AS CALIFORNIA'S COSTS ARE ARE REALLY RISING RAPIDLY IN THE AREA OUTSIDE OF TUITION IT'S JUST SIMPLY NOT. ENOUGH TO THE HIGH COST OF LIVING STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA TO JUST SIMPLY COVER TUITION AND- LEAVE THE REST TO THE STUDENT- THE STATE DOES NEED TO BE MORE COGNIZANT AND BETTER DRESSED WE CALL THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE. BEYOND JUST TUITION AND FEES ESPECIALLY CENTER IN CALIFORNIA HAS A VERY VERY HIGH HOUSING COSTS- FOOD TRANSPORTATION BOOKS AND SUPPLIES CHILD CARE THESE ARE ALL COLLECTIVELY OUTPACING TUITION AND FEES CALIFORNIA. IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND NINETEEN WITH THE STUDENT A COMMISSION SET UP TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE COST THE ACTUAL COST AND THE RESOURCES THAT STUDENTS HAVE AVAILABLE TO THEM. BY RELAUNCHING WHAT WE CALL THE STUDENT EXPENSES AND RESOURCES SURVEY OR SEARS- IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE COLLEGE FUTURES FOUNDATION AND MATHEMATICA. THE SURVEY SAMPLE THE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIA COLLEGE STUDENTS FROM ALL SEGMENTS OF HIGHER EDUCATION ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES AND PERCEPTIONS OF COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY. AND THE RESULTS REVEALED MORE MEANINGFUL DIFFERENCES IN THE EXPENSES FOR COLLEGE COSTS WHEN BROKEN DOWN BY RACE AND ETHNICITY BROKEN DOWN BY AGE AND ALSO BROKEN DOWN BY GEOGRAPHICAL REGION. AS WELL AS VALUABLE INSIGHTS ABOUT STUDENTS CAPTIONS ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO PAY FOR. HIGHER COST OF THEIR EDUCATION OUR INITIAL ANALYSIS OF THE DATA FOUND ROUGHLY TWO THIRDS OF THE STUDENTS SURVEYED SAID THAT THEIR NUMBER ONE OBSTACLE IS. THEIR SUCCESS THIS EITHER THE COST OF CALL FOR BALANCING THEIR SCHOOL AND WORK RESPONSIBILITIES SO ALSO PLAYING IN THE COST OF COLLEGE AS WELL. FOR THE FOR THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE OF NON TUITION COSTS REPORTED BY STUDENTS IS ROUGHLY A LITTLE BIT NORTH OF TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS PER MONTH FOR ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR SO THINK ABOUT THAT NUMBER FOR A MOMENT. THANK OKAY THIS IS NOT A LIVING HIGH ON THE HOG TYPE OF NUMBER THINK ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE TO LIVE ON TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH IN CALIFORNIA. THE OTHER COSTS IN THE FACE OF HOUSING AND THINGS LIKE THAT AS A RESULT IT WAS NO SURPRISE TO US THAT NEARLY ONE IN THREE STUDENTS. CROSSED ALL THE SECTORS. XP A REPORTED EXPERIENCE WHAT WE CALL FOOD OR HOUSING IN SECURITY AND ANY GIVEN MONTH WE HAVE A BANK OF QUESTIONS ON THE SURVEY THAT ASK QUESTIONS LIKE YOU KNOW IN THIS MONTH ARE YOU WERE YOU UNABLE TO PAY A UTILITY BILL WERE YOU UNABLE TO PAY THE FULL AMOUNT OF YOUR RENT. DID YOU MOVE MORE THAN TWO TIMES DID YOU SKIP MEALS THIS MONTH BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T HAVE A SOURCE OF MONEY OR YOU JUST RAN OUT OF MONEY- AND ALL THESE PLAY INTO WHAT WE CALL FOOD AND HOUSING AND SECURITY. IS A ONE IN THREE IN CALIFORNIA REPORTED THAT IN A GIVEN MONTH. THE DATA COLLECTED THROUGH THE SEARS SURVEY IS THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE DATA AVAILABLE ON ACTUAL STUDENT EXPENSES. AND INCOME SOURCES TO PAY FOR COLLEGE. AND THE DATA COME DIRECTLY FROM THE STUDENTS THEMSELVES AND IT CONFIRMS A LOT OF OUR ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE THAT THERE'S A GROWING PROPORTION OF STUDENTS WHO JUST HAVE A DIFFICULTY IN MEETING THE BASIC COST OF ATTENDING COLLEGE. I'M AND ALSO PROVIDES DATA SUPPORT THE CONSIDERATION OF REGIONAL DIFFERENCES- IT DOCUMENTS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER PROPORTIONS OF HISPANIC AND BLACK STUDENTS REPORT DIFFICULTY IN MEETING THE COSTS OF COLLEGE. EXPERIENCE GREATER RATES OF BASIC FOOD AND HOUSING AND SECURITY. THREATS DATA POINTS RELATED TO STUDENT DEBTS- THERE WERE SOME QUESTIONS ON THIS YEAR'S SURVEY REGARDING STUDENT DEBT BUT THEY PRIMARILY WERE RELATED TO THE USE OF CREDIT CARDS AND STUDENT THAT. WE DON'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF DATA POINTS RELATED TO STUDENT DEBT- THIS FOR AS LONG TERM LOANS AND THINGS LIKE THAT WE DO COLLECT SOME INFORMATION FROM INSTITUTES ON COVERT DEFAULT RATES WHICH IS THE INDICATOR OF A STUDENT'S ABILITY TO REPAY THEIR STUDENT LOANS. AFTER GRADUATING FROM A PARTICULAR INSTITUTION- WE DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO GET WAGE DATA TO SHOW HOW MUCH STUDENTS ARE MAKING BOTH DURING COLLEGE AND AFTER COLLEGE AND WHAT ARE THEIR ABILITY TO PAY THESE LOANS. HOWEVER THIS DOESN'T TELL US A WHOLE LOT ABOUT THE STUDENT THAT STUDENTS ARE TAKING ON. PRESUMABLY TO PAY FOR A LOT OF OUT OF POCKET COSTS THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY OTHER TYPES OF AID. AS THE STATE'S FINANCIAL AID AGENCY WE'D LIKE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW OUR STUDENTS ARE IMPACTED BY STUDENT DEBT- WE CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT YOU KNOW. WHERE SHOULD WE BEST PLACE STATE BASED ON ACTUAL RATE IN THE ENTIRE PACKAGE OF FINANCIAL AID AVAILABLE TO EVERYBODY THE CALIBER IN THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP OR ALL ABOUT MAKING COLLEGE AFFORDABLE AND DESIGNED TO OFFSET THE NEED TO TAKE OUT STUDENT LOANS IN THE FIRST PLACE. WHILE WE DO COLLECT A LOT. PFAFF SOME OF FAMILY SIZE INCOME THINGS LIKE THAT WE ARE MISSING KEY DATA POINTS THAT WOULD HELP US UNDERSTAND WHETHER ARE FINANCIALLY PROGRAMS ARE WORKING IN THE WAYS IN WHICH WE WANTED TO BASICALLY BECAUSE WE CAPTURE A LOT OF DATA AT THE START OF A STUDENT'S EDUCATIONAL PROCESS AND NOT NECESSARILY AT THE END. WE HAVE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT STUDENT LEVEL FINANCIAL AID PACKAGING SUCH AS YOU KNOW A SINGLE SOURCE OF DATA WHERE WE CAN LOOK AT YOU KNOW DID THEY GET FEDERAL AID STATE AID LOCAL AID GRANTS AND THEN WHAT WAS LEFT OVER FROM LOAN. I MEAN THAT WAS DATA POINTS ALL EXIST BUT WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE THEM IN ONE SCENE LOCATION WHERE WE CAN GET TO THAT AND REALLY EXAMINE AT THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE. REALLY LIKE TO GET. AND FURTHERMORE ASSIST. THE WE HAVE THIS THE FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR. EXAMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS THAT WE PUT OUT AND FINANCIAL AID EVERY YEAR. WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF EXAMINING CAL GRANT REFORM EFFORTS- STATE HAS AVENUES TO INCREASE SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS STRUGGLING WITH THESE OUT OF POCKET COSTS. OF FORCING THEM TO LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR SUPPORT INCLUDING STUDENT LOANS AND I WAS I WOULD ALSO SAY AND CREDIT CARDS. SO IF YOU'RE LIVING OFF A TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH. IMMEDIATE PROBLEM IS I HAVE TO PAY A BILL OR I NEED TO GO TO THE GROCERY STORE YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO GO DOWN AND FILL OUT. THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID LOAN PACKAGE TO TRY AND SOLVE YOUR IMMEDIATE PROBLEM OF THE DAY. MORE OFTEN THAN NOT THAT GOES ON A CREDIT CARD WHICH IS YOU CAN PROBABLY IMAGINE IS THE WORST POSSIBLE PIECE OF STUDENT DEBT YOU COULD PROBABLY CUMULATE. THE MAJOR STATEWIDE GRANT PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES SUPPORT FOR NON TUITION EXPENSES WHICH IS THE CAL GRANT BE ACCESS AWARD CURRENTLY THAT ACCESS AWARD PROVIDES ELIGIBLE STUDENTS WITH ABOUT SEVENTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS PER ACADEMIC YEAR. THAT'S A YEAR REMEMBER THERE SPENDING TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH ON NON TUITION COSTS SO IT REALLY DOESN'T DOESN'T COVER A WHOLE LOT WITH THAT AMOUNT- THAT ACCESS AWARD WAS WAS IMPLEMENTED IN THE LATE NINETEEN SIXTIES ORIGINALLY IT WAS NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS HAD THAT KEPT PACE WITH AND FOR. THE ACCESS OR WOULD BE ABOUT SIXTY DOLLARS TODAY. AND SO IT'S WORTH ROUGHLY TWENTY FIVE CENTS ON THE DOLLAR OF WHAT IT ORIGINALLY WAS DESIGNED TO COVER. THE COMMISSION CERTAINLY ENCOURAGES THE LEGISLATURE TO APPROPRIATE FUNDING TO PHASE IN INCREASES TO CAL GRANT BE ACCESS AWARDS TO COVER AN OFFSET SOME OF THESE AREAS THAT STUDENTS ACCUMULATE DEBT ON. AND WHILE WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT WOULD INCREASE AND CARRY A SUBSTANTIAL FISCAL IMPACT TO THE STATE IT CERTAINLY WOULD PAY SIGNIFICANT DIVIDENDS BY REDUCE STUDENT FOOD AND HOUSING AND SECURITY AND ULTIMATELY REDUCING STUDENTS RELIANCE ON LOAN THAT SEE SACK IS COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE STATE AND ALL OF ITS LEADERS ON. TO HELP FIND OUT WHAT IS AND WHAT IS NOT WORKING FOR STUDENTS AND CREATE A VERY EQUITABLE FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM THAT SERVES THE NEEDS OF THE STATE AND ITS STUDENTS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I DO HAVE A FEW FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS BUT I THINK WHAT WE'LL DO IS- WE TO HEAR FROM MR CASEIN AND THEN WE CAN. LOOK BACK. THANKS GOOD MORNING EVERYONE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. I'M AN ART MAJOR SO NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE HERE. SO. HOME AS MENTIONED I DO SERVICE THAT INTEREST THE HERE AT. THE COLLEGE- ELECTED WITH HIM BODY AND MY MAIN JOB IS JUST BEING THE LIAISON BETWEEN ACT AMAZING PURCHASE THE NUMBERS. AND THE STUDENTS- SO RIGHT NOW WHAT'S ON A LOT OF STUDENTS STUDENTS MIND IS WE JUST TURN INTO YOU SEE AND CAL STATE UPS. IT WAS A FUN NIGHT. AND I KIND OF JUST TO START OFF YOU KNOW THE COST OF THESE APPLICATIONS SO IT IS SEVENTY DOLLARS PER APPLICATION AND- AS I MENTIONED AS A DESIGN MAJOR. AT A LOT OF THE SCHOOLS THERE IS A SUPPLEMENTAL FEATURES TURN IN MY PORTFOLIO TO THE SCHOOL SO FOR UCLA IT'S AN ADDITIONAL FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS A TO PAY ON TOP OF THE SEVENTY DOLLARS. AND JUST BECAUSE YOU KNOW NOT ALL THE UC'S OUR HOUSES OFFER NO INTENT OF DESIGN PROGRAMS I HAVE A LOT OF DESIGN STUDENTS FACE THEMSELVES. APPLYING TO THE UC BECAUSE THE SYSTEM AND PRIVATE HIGH SCHOOL SYSTEMS. SO THE ST STE THE ARTICLE IS NEAREST TO US AND AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH IS ARTS CENTER. AND YOU KNOW THIS IS A SCHOOL THAT IS GEOGRAPHICALLY VERY VERY CLOSE TO US BUT FINANCIALLY IT COULD NOT BE FARTHER APART. IT IS ABOUT TWENTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS PER TRIMESTER TO IT ARTS CENTER AT THE MOMENT WHICH IS. AT THE VERY QUICKLY IN THE END USER IN THIS IS A COST NO DOES NOT. SUPPLY IS NOT INCLUDED. AND SOMETHING WE ALSO REALIZE THAT WHEN WE DO TRANSFERRED TO THESE PRIVATE SCHOOLS IT IS NOT YOU KNOW. WE ARE NOT CHANGING THEIR THE JUNIOR WE SOUGHT TO COMPLETE FOUR YEARS AT THESE PRIVATE SCHOOLS A LOT OF COMMITTEE BECAUSE HE DIDN'T. COME HERE YOU KNOW KIND OF LIKE THE 50% OFF MENTALITY OF LIKE TWO YEARS HERE. HERE'S ANOTHER UNIVERSITY BUT A LOT OF THE SCHOOLS IS GONNA BE AND AT LEAST A THREE YEAR SYSTEM WHICH IS NOT BAD YOU KNOW YOU DO YOU WANT TO BE. PREPARED AND WHAT HAPPENS IS WHENEVER YOU TAKE THESE COURSES THAT- COMING COLLEGE THAT BASICALLY LEAVES HOLES. IN YOUR SYSTEM ANY AND ALL THE GENERAL IT IS AND YOU CAN FILL IT. WITH OTHER CLASSES SO PERSONALLY- OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL I APPLIED TO GO TO SCHOOL DESIGN WHICH IS AND MARINA DEL REY. AND THERE I A- I WAS ACCEPTED. BUT IT WAS ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THE TUITION. I DID RECEIVE TWENTY THOUSAND AMERICANS LIKE OH COOL BUT THEN I FOUND OUT ROOM AND BOARD WAS ANOTHER TWENTY THOUSAND SO. THE AND YOU KNOW THIS CULTURE OF MAKING SURE YOU ATTEND THE UC AND CAL STATE NOTE STATE GHOST THEIR HIGH SCHOOL SO I AM FROM THE LOCKERS IN A BLOCKING OUT AREA AND OF MY HIGH SCHOOL I'VE A LOT OF FRIENDS WHO JUST WENT TO A CAL STATE OR YOU SEE JUST FOR THE SAKE OF GOING TO THAT SCHOOL NOT FOR THE SAKE OF YOU KNOW. WHAT WHAT THEIR MAJOR WAS IF HE HAD A FEEL FOR THE CAMPUS ITEM AND WHO CAME FROM UC RIVERSIDE TO PCC SHE TOOK WHILE SHE'S AT RIVERSIDE FOR A FOR FIRST SEMESTER SHE TOOK A BUNCH OF ELECTIVE COURSES SENATOR THEM TRANSFERRED BACK HERE SO THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS THAT WAS SPENT ON COURSES- AND IT'S JUST A LOT OF SINCE THE PLANS FOR THE SAKE OF. I GO TO UC SO PERSONALLY. AS I MENTIONED I LIVE IN THE LOCKER CENTER AREA. AND THERE'S A LOT OF INCREASING COSTS THERE RIGHT NOW AND AT THE MOMENT I FOUND OUT ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO I HAD TO MOVE. FROM THE HOUSE THEY LIVED IN FOR ABOUT FORTY FOR FOURTEEN YEARS OF MY LIFE IT'S LIKE. AND TWENTY SOMEONE THEIR LIFE- DIGESTED ANY CREASING COSTS AND RENT OF THE AREAS OUR LANDLORD GAVE US UNTIL. MARCH TWENTY TWENTY TO MOVE OUT OF OUR TOWN HOUSE AND MONTROSE. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY JUST WEARING NOT ONLY AS A STUDENT BUT AS A- CHILD NOW. CAN I PERRANCE AFFORD TO BUY A NEW HOME. AND SEND A CHILD TO UNIVERSITY IN A SIX MONTH PERIOD YOU KNOW. MARCH WE HAVE TO BE OUT OF THERE. SEPTEMBER AUGUST I'LL BE GOING TO A SCHOOL. AND IT'S JUST A VERY VERY. HEAVY RELIANCE ON SCHOLARSHIPS SO. THROUGHOUT THIS WEEK LEADING UP- TO THIS HEARING I JUST TALKED TO A LOT OF MY- FELLOW STUDENTS JUST LIKE. PART OF MY JOB AS TRUSTEE NOW I KNOW I'M NOT. THE SOLE VOICE OF THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE. AND A LOT OF THEIR CONCERNS THERE IS A I HAVE A STUDENT AND MY ART HISTORY CLASS HE'S A PUBLIC HEALTH MAJOR. IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW SHE DOESN'T WANT TO SPEND THE REST OF HER LIFE PAYING OFF STUDENT AT. THIS IS. A VERY VERY REAL CONCERN. FOR A LOT OF ME BECAUSE STUDENTS AS- WE LIVING IN LOS ANGELES UNIT HOUSING IS GOING TO BE. VERY EXPENSIVE. IF YOU WANT TO STAY HERE. AS A- STUDENT- IN. MY CLASS WITH UNDER SOMETHING AND SHE SAID I HAVE A SNEAKING SUSPICION THAT I'M ONLY PINPOINT PAYING FOR THE NAME BRAND. OF THE SCHOOL TO STRAIN TO GO TO. AND THERE'S A HEAVY RELIANCE ON SCHOLARSHIPS THAT ARE NOT GUARANTEED. SO YOU KNOW THERE IS ITEM ANOTHER FRIEND I WAS TALKING TO ABOUT THIS. AND YOU'RE SAYING YOU KNOW I'M RELYING ON SCHOLARSHIPS BUT DEEP DOWN I DON'T I'M GOING TO GET IT YOU KNOW SOMETIMES. WAY OR YOU ARE FINANCIALLY WHERE INCOME IS MINE YOU MAY NOT QUALIFY FOR THAT. THE SITUATIONS LIKE I MENTIONED I'M GONNA BE MOVING SOON. I LIVE IN A MIDDLE CLASS AREA BUT THAT'S GONNA BE A HUGE BURDEN ON MY PARENTS. SO KIND OF JUST GETTING A IT'S A VERY VERY REAL CONCERN TO THEM THAT FOR COMEY COLLEGE STUDENTS EVEN THOUGH RIGHT NOW. NOT THE MAJORITY OF US ARE FACING THIS BUT IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT'S- LOOMING- IN THE BACK OF OUR HEADS AS WE PLAYED THE SCHOOLS. WE HAVE TO CONSIDER THE COST WOULD BE PAYING DOWN THE LINE. THANK YOU THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR THE WORK THAT YOU DO ON BEHALF OF YOUR STUDENT BODY FROM. TWO COUPLE OF QUESTIONS YOU ADD IT TO SEE WHY YOU MENTIONED THE FACT THAT WE'RE LEAVING A LOT OF MONEY ON THE TABLE. THERE IS FOR YOU KNOW FOR ANYONE ON THAT HOW DO WE HAVE A SENSE OF HOW MUCH WE'RE LEAVING ON THE TABLE EITHER TO FEDERAL OR STATE LEVEL. AND ARE THERE SPECIFIC POPULOUS YOUR LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS THAT WE COULD INTRODUCE TO HELP CLOSE THAT GAP AND LEAVE LEAVE US THAT MONEY ON THE TABLE. FOR YEAH- SO- I MENTIONED THE TPS REPORT. GREEN READ A I THINK THEIR CALCULATION IT'S LIKE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION PER SEMESTER WHICH IS JUST AMAZING I DON'T KNOW IF THAT NUMBER STILL ACCURATE IT'S BEEN ABOUT FIVE OR SIX YEARS I THINK SINCE I HAVE THAT REPORT THE AMERICAN CHANGES SO AS THE FINANCIAL A TASK FOR STARTERS LOOK AT THIS YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S- WHEN THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT AT THE STATE LEVEL PLACE. IT'S IT DOESN'T. MAKE A GOOD STORY FOR US TO GO TO LEGISLATURE ASK FOR MORE MONEY FOR LEAVING MONEY ON THE TABLE THAT. PUTS THEM IN A POSITION OF WONDERING WHY. THE MONEY THAT THEY'VE ALLOCATED IS NOT BEING USED SO AS WE DELVED INTO THIS ISSUE. WE THE LOW HANGING FRUIT WAS TO CHANGE THE CULTURE OF THE OPERATION IN OUR COLLEGES. AS I SAID- THERE SO THE HEAVY BURDEN ON OUR FINANCIAL AID OFFICERS TO- THAT THEY FILL OUT BURDEN. THAT THEY ARE ONE OF THREE ENTITIES ON COLLEGES THAT CAN HELP PERSONALLY. LIABLE FOR NOT HAVING COMPLETED ALL OF THEIR- THE NECESSARY VERIFICATION OF AS STUDENTS QUALIFICATIONS BEFORE THEY GIVE OUT THE AID BUT I AM PROUD TO SAY THAT THEY CAME UP WITH THAT THESE OVER HUNDRED RECOMMENDATIONS OF WHAT COULD BE CHANGE SOMEONE IS FIND A WAY TO GET THE MONEY TO STUDENTS EARLY- IF STUDENTS IN A LOOK AT THE NUMBER CATIONS A GOT TURNED AND HOW MANY DID GET ACTUALLY COMPLETED BUT START THAT GOT STARTED THANK YOU SORT OF A FLY. THAT FLIGHT YOUR OPERATION THAT THE STUDENT NEEDED HELP THE- MAYBE THEY CAME FROM AND UNDOCUMENTED FAMILY OR MORE. FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO GET THE INFORMATION TURNED IN OR THEIR PARENTS FELT RELUCTANT TO TURN THEIR THE INFORMATION AND IF THEY WERE- MINORS. SO THEY THEMSELVES ARE HAVE KNOCKED DOWN- ARE FOUND SOLUTIONS TO KNOCK DOWN THE STAIRS SO THIS WAS JUST IDENTIFIED I THINK IT'S GOING TO TAKE US- I. MAYBE A YEAR FOR US TO IT LOOK AT. HOW THAT CULTURE CHANGE- IS REALLY WILL CHANGE HOW WE ARE MONIES STUDENTS BUT CHEST. AT JUSTIN THE LAST CONFERENCE WE HAVE LAST MONTH A FEW OF THE COLLEGES WHO BEGAN TO IMPLEMENT THOSE CHANGES HAVE REPORTED LIKE A CHANGE OF- ALMOST 85% OF THOSE STUDENTS WHO APPLIED GOT THEIR AID GOT IT ON TIME KIND OF BEFORE THE SEMESTER STARTED. WHEN COLLEGE REPORTED THAT THEY ONLY HAD TO ISSUE I'M- SOMETHING LIKE I DON'T KNOW. LESS THAN A HUNDRED LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED- BOOK VOUCHERS SO WHERE DOES THAT MEAN WHAT THAT MEANT IS THEY GOT THE MONEY TO STUDENTS IN TIME FOR THEM TO PAY FOR THE REGISTRATION AND PAY FOR THEIR BOOKS. WERE IN BEFORE THEY WERE WAITING FOR ALL VERIFICATION TO- ALL OF THE DOCUMENTS TO BE VERIFIED AND MANY TIMES OF STUDENTS THEN HAD TO FIND WAYS TO PAY FOR THE REGISTRATION OR HAD TO GO OUT AND GET A VOUCHER FOR A LOAN FROM THE SCHOOL TO PAY FOR THEIR BOOKS. AND HAD TO REPEAT IT BACK ONCE THEY GOT THEIR FINANCIAL AID- SO THESE ARE SMALL THINGS IS A CULTURE CHANGES THAT WE CAN WE CAN MAKE SO IT WAS EMBARRASSING FOR US TO LOOK AT THAT TO REALIZE IT BUT IT ALSO WAS A GOOD. A FLAG FOR US TO THEN SAY THERE'S SOME THINGS WE COULD DO A LOT BETTER AND STUDENTS HIMSELF CAME UP WITH SOME REALLY GREAT IDEAS LIKE PUT PEER TO PEER MENTORING HAVE A LITTLE A STUDY CENTER SO THAT STUDENTS COMMAND AND THEY HAVE THEY NEED ASSISTANCE OF FINANCIAL AID. INSTEAD OF HAVING TO GO TO AN ADULT WHICH THEY MAY BE RELUCTANT TO DO THEY HAVE HERE THAT WILL COME IN AND HELP THEM GET THROUGH THE FOR WORK I ONE THING. THAT INTERESTS ME SIR TO SEE AN. ARE A S. AND TOM WE TALKED ABOUT A COUPLE OF. AT LAST MONTH AT THE RIVERSIDE CONFERENCE AS ADAM PUT IN AND JUST SORT OF A STUDENT FEEDBACK. LOU JUST TO FIND OUT WHAT ARE THE THINGS YOU KNOW HOW HOW WAS THE SERVICE AT THAT DESK WHAT IF THINGS GOT YOUR WAY TO GET GREAT SERVICE. AND IT'S TO DOING ANY EMPLOYEES BECAUSE I THINK EVERYBODY IS DOING THE BEST THEY CAN- BUT THERE COUPLE YOU KNOW I THINK THAT- IT GIVES YOU GOOD FEEDBACK ON WHETHER OR NOT THAT STUDENT FEELS LIKE THEY'RE BEING SERVED. AND THEN ALSO IT'S A TAKE FOR US IS AS TRUSTEES THAT IF THERE'S AN OPERATION THAT IS HAVING A HARD TIME SERVING STUDENTS AND WE NEED TO BE. MINDFUL WHEN WE ALLOCATE BUDGETS AND WE APPROVED TO MAKE SURE THE RESOURCES ARE THERE STUDENTS SERVICES IT'S BEEN A REALLY I'M- OUR- FIRST AREA MANY COLLEGES. BECAUSE MOST VEGAS ACADEMICS BUT YOU KNOW WITH ALL OF THE INITIATIVES THAT WERE PUTTING FORWARD ON. FOR COLLEGE AND FOR CAREER CENTER IT REALLY REQUIRES- THAT CONSIDER SERVICE IN BUT IT REQUIRES TO RESOURCES FOR CONCIERGE SERVICE TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH STUDENTS. GOT IT. SOME CAMPUSES HAS- MADE. PFAFF THE COMPLETION DISCOVER MANDATORY PART AS THE- IN A REGULAR ENROLLMENT PROCESS IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING UNIVERSALLY AND SYSTEM WIDE. I DO IMPACT WOULD BE I DO KNOW THAT TOM. A SO I DID I HAVE TALKED TO THE CHANCELLOR OF ONE OF THE COLLEGES AND WHEN THEY GO TO THE HIGH SCHOOL THEY JUST TELL THE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WE DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE WE DON'T KNOW IF HE FINANCIALLY. FILL ALL THE PAPERWORK ADDING WAY BECAUSE IN A BE READY FOR YOU IF YOU TO. TO IF YOU MAKE A DECISION ON THE ASSET IS A REALLY LONG PROCESS AND I JUST HEARD ONE STUDENTS SAY THAT SHE- TOOK A FIFTEEN MINUTES TO GET THROUGH BECAUSE IT WAS AUTOMATED WAS SO FAST. BUT I TALKED TO CONGREGATE CHEF. JUST STARTING COLLEGE AND HE SAID IT WAS A DAUNTING PROCESS AS IT CAN'T COME A WILL TO HELP HER FIGURE ADDED TO THIS AND- I. WISH THAT. WE SAW. A LOT PAUL FIGURE SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT ONE OF START CONGRESSMAN HAVE TIME HELPING IS DAUGHTER HOW HOW DAUNTING THIS MUST BE FOR STUDENTS SO I DO THINK THAT THE EARLIER WE CAN GET- STUDENTS TO DO THIS I THINK- AND TAKE OFF SIR THE STIGMA OF OKAY MAYBE IT WASN'T YOUR FOR SURE JUST WHAT HAD FELT THE PAPERWORK AND GET YOURSELF READY. I THINK THOSE MAYBE THINGS THAT COULD BE FOR. AND THEN I. YOU TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT- ABOUT SOME DATA GAPS IN TERMS OF THAT THE INFORMATION THAT YOU HAVE ACCESS TO- YOU KNOW WHAT- KIND OF THEM. THEN THIS CRITICAL GATE DATA GAPS HOW CAN WE CLOSE THEM. AND WITH THAT INFORMATION HOW CAN WE CREATE MORE TRANSPARENCY. FOR STUDENTS AND FOR POTENTIAL BORROWERS. OKAY AS PART OF THAT SURE- SO. CALLOUS THE HIGHER ED SEGMENTS AND THE STUDENT AID SEGMENT WE WE'VE LIVED IN DATA SILOS FOR QUITE AWHILE NOW- AT AND I THINK. WE NOW HAVE AN ADMINISTRATION WHO IS VERY EAGER TO- ADVANCE BECAUSE OF DATA SHARING AND YOU KNOW A LOT OF DATA WE DO HAVE IT'S JUST THAT WE DON'T HAVE A- SHARE THIS GOVERNOR HAS BEGUN THE PROCESS OF DOING THE CREDIT. WHICH WERE VERY MUCH GOING TO BE LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING DONE AND WITHOUT SIMPLE THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW IN THE STUDENT AID OF. DATA SAID. IN A WAY WHERE YOU GO FOR THE STUDENTS WHO DID NOT TAKE A CAL GRANT OF WHICH THERE'S A DECENT AMOUNT OF STUDENTS WHO DO NOT TAKE A CAL GRANT WILL GET BACK TO LEAVING MONEY ON THE TABLE. WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY WENT OR WHAT WAS THE BLOCKADE BEHIND THAT SO JUST SIMPLY MATCHING WITH ENTITIES LIKE SHE ISSUE IN YOU SEE- THE NATIONAL STUDENT CLEARINGHOUSE TO FIND OUT OKAY DID THEY LEAVE CALIFORNIA. ARE THEY NOT IN COLLEGE ANYWHERE CAN WE MATCHING THE EDT DATA FILES THEY'RE WORKING HOW MUCH THEY WORKING JUST SIMPLY SIMPLY TRACKING TO GET A HAND ON. THE DAY. OF. METRICS OF BOTH ACCOUNTABILITY AND STUDENT MOVEMENT BETWEEN THE SEGMENTS WOULD HELP GREATLY. THE OTHER THING I MENTIONED TO WAS WE NEED TO HAVE A SINGLE PLACE WHERE WE CAN LOOK AT THE ENTIRE STUDENT LOAN FINANCING PACKAGE RIGHT NOW WE ALL HAVE A SILO LIKE HERE'S THE FEDERAL DATA HERE'S THE STATE DATA. HERE'S THE LOCAL FINANCIAL AID HERE THE SCHOLARSHIPS THEY GOT HERE'S THE WORK STUDY BUT WE DON'T HAVE A SINGLE PLACE WE CAN EXAMINE ALL OF THIS SINGULARLY IN HOLISTICALLY TO FIND OUT WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO MANAGE ALL OF THIS. THOSE TO ME ARE THE TWO BIGGEST DATA GAPS I MENTIONED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SUIT. WHO YOU KNOW THE WHAT WE CALL THE PAID RATE FOR CAL GRANT IS NOT AS HIGH AS WE WOULD LIKE IT TO BE THERE'S A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS WHO WERE. WHO GET A CAL GRANT LETTER SAYING HERE'S FREE MONEY AND THEY DON'T TAKE IT- THAT MONEY LEFT ON THE TABLE AND WE ACTUALLY DON'T. REALLY KNOW WHY THOSE STUDENTS ARE NOT TAKING IT ARE THEY GOING OUT OF STATE OR ARE THERE ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES THAT CAMPUSES THAT WE COULD FIGURE OUT. IT EASIER FOR THEM TO GET IT- WE'VE GOT TO START WITHOUT. SOURCE LEAVING FEDERAL MONEY ON ON THE TABLE- GOOD COMMENTS ALREADY. YOU KNOW WHAT. YOU DID SEE SOME STATES RIGHT NOW WHO ARE ON. FULLY TO MAKE. THAT HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS. OKAY I THINK TENNESSEE HAS DONE. I AM THIS IS KIND OF AN EXTREME THING- AND YOU DO HAVE SOME CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOLS WILL VOLUNTARILY DONE US. I KNOW SEE SEXUALLY RUNS A COMPETITION WHERE WE REWARD HIGH SCHOOLS WHO HAVE VERY HIGH FAST OF COMPLETION RATES. SO I WOULD START WITH JUST SIMPLY MAKING THAT A VERY. POPULAR OF HI PUBLIC VIEW METRIC I'M NOT. SAYING WHAT'S YOU KNOW PUT ACCOUNTABILITY ON IT YET BUT LET'S JUST MAKE THAT A VERY VISIBLE PUBLIC PATRICK TO START WITH SO WE KNOW WHERE EVERYONE IS OUT. AND WE KNOW WHERE EVERYONE SHOULD BE MOVED TO. AND THEN ONE OTHER QUESTION AROUND CAL GRANT YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU'RE IN THE PROCESS AS- EVALUATING YOU SPECIAL CAL GRANT REFORMS. WHEN IS THAT. REPORT OR- ANY OF SAID RECOMMENDATIONS EXPECTED TO BE JAIL THIS IS THIS IS A PRETTY FAST TRACK SO- WE HAVE A WORK GROUP THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH RIGHT NOW AND OUR GOAL IS TO GET. THIS INTO SOME TYPE OF LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE HERE FOR THE NEXT CYCLE SO WE'RE LOOKING AT PROBABLY FEBRUARY OR SO A GREAT HAS SOMETHING AVAILABLE FOR BOTH THE GOVERNOR. AND THE LEGISLATURE TO START LOOKING. AND YOU EXPECT THAT THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS LEAVE MORE THAN THE OBVIOUS HAVE INCREASING FRIENDLY YES CORRECT IT YEAH GREAT- WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO SIMPLIFY. THE PROCESS IN CERTAINLY EXPAND THE POOL WHEREVER POSSIBLE GREAT LOCAL THAT FOR TODAY TO THAT CERTAINLY IN FEBRUARY. I'M WITHOUT WITH THANK YOU AGAIN ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE AND FOR SHARING YOUR PERSPECTIVES- AND FOR ALL THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING. ON THIS REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE THANK YOU FOR THAT THANK YOU. CREDIT WILL GO AHEAD AND TRANSITION OUR NEXT PANEL. I THE TITLE OUR NEXT PANELIST IMPACTS ON CALIFORNIA NEIGHBORHOODS. ARE FOCUSED ON LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE'VE GOT. AS A SEND A FELLA WHO IS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR WITH THE LA COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AND BUSINESS AFFAIRS. OUT WE'D ALSO LIKE TO WELCOME TO NASH'S SMITH WHO IS THE CHIEF AT THE LA COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AND BUSINESS AFFAIRS AT THE CENTER FOR FINANCIAL EMPOWERMENT. THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING HERE AND JOIN US THIS MORNING. IF. GOOD MORNING EVERYONE SO WE'D ALSO LIKE TO START OFF BY THANKING YOU FOR STAYING I'M SUCH AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION AND FOR INVITING US TO BE A PART OF IT I'M THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AND BUSINESS AFFAIRS HAS BEEN PROVIDING ARMED SERVICES TO CONSUMERS SMALL BUSINESSES I'M IN THE COUNTY SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX AND SO TODAY WILL FOCUS IN ON TO- AREAS OF OUR WORK THAT DIRECTLY CONNECTED WITH NOT JUST STUDENT AT THE HIGH COST LOANS AND SO ALSO. TELLING YOU HOW I AM SOME OF OUR SERVICES TO THE YOU CAN SEE THE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH THAT WE TAKE- TO PROTECT CONSUMERS I AM. IN THE COUNTY AND SO MORE RECENTLY- WE'VE EXPANDED OUR TENANT PROTECTIONS FOCUSED ON RENT STABILIZATION AS YOU'VE HEARD TODAY THERE'S A DIRECT. CONNECTION BETWEEN STUDENTS NOT JUST BEING ABLE TO ACCESS EDUCATION BUT ALSO HAVING STABILITY- IN HOUSING AND FOOD AND SECURITY- WE LOOK AT WAGE ENFORCEMENT MAKING SURE THAT EMPLOYERS ARE PAYING ON THE COUNTY MINIMUM WAGE SO OUR- OUR OUR OUR STUDENTS IN OUR THEIR PARENTS RECEIVING. THE WAGES THAT THEY RIGHTFULLY DESERVE SO WITH AN INVESTIGATION UNIT FOR THAT WE HAVE- IMMIGRANT AFFAIRS IT'S FOCUSED ON PROTECTING AGAIN THOSE PEOPLE'S PHONE HERBAL I'M- IT MAY NOT NECESSARILY OR EASILY CONNECT TO. TO PUBLIC SERVICES ARE WE HAVE A SMALL BUSINESS UTILIZATION THAT'S FOCUSED ON INCREASING- CONTRACTS- TO SMALL BUSINESSES. I'M WE HAVE FORECLOSURE PREVENTION FOR HOMEOWNERS EXPERIENCING CHALLENGES WITH THEIR MORTGAGES. AND THEN TODAY WILL FOCUS ON CONSUMER PROTECTION AND THE CENTER FOR FINANCIAL EMPOWERMENT OVERSEEN BY DONNIE CHAU MY COLLEAGUE SO YOU'LL GET TO HEAR FROM HER TODAY AS WELL SO WE- ARE IN DOING SOME OF THE RESEARCH AS WE WERE PREPARING FOR THIS CONVERSATION. YOU'VE HEARD A LOT AROUND OUR INFORMATION ON STUDENTS ATTENDING PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND SO WHEN WE STARTED TO LOOK AT OUR DATA INTERNALLY AND UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OUR TRACKING SYSTEM ONLY GOES BACK TO TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN IN TERMS OF A FORMAL A DATABASE AND TRACKING SYSTEM- WHAT WE FOUND. IS TWO THINGS ONE IS THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE CONSUMERS OR BORROWERS THAT COME TO US OUR BORROWERS- THAT HAVE ATTENDED A FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS I. GOT SCHOOL DOWN THERE IS A BIG WAVE OF THOSE THAT THAT SHUT DOWN A FEW YEARS AGO AND SO MANY OF THOSE FOR CALLING OUR CENTER LOOKING FOR. AN. THEN I HAVE BEEN GROUP BEFORE. I'M CALLING ON BECAUSE MAYBE THEY TOOK ADVANTAGE OF WHAT THEY THOUGHT WAS A FEDERAL STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAM AND SO NOW THEY WERE THEY WERE VICTIMS OF A DIFFERENT SORT OF SCAM YOU'LL ALSO HEAR TODAY SOME OF THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON FOSTER YOUTH AND SO WILL TELL YOU SOME OF THE EFFORT ON THAT THE COUNTY IS TAKING THE FOCUS ON. POPULATION SO WHAT YOU'LL HEAR IS OUR WORK IS REALLY FOCUSED ON THE FOR AN EDUCATION IN ON THE ACT CAN ONCE CONSUMERS FARMERS ARE VICTIMS OF POTENTIALLY SCAMS RIGHT UNDERNEATH THAT AND ALSO OUR WORK AROUND SOME OF THE POLICY WE'RE- FOCUSED ON. HIGH COST. SO WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER I'M TO MY COLLEAGUES. TELL YOU ABOUT I'M THE EDUCATION EFFORTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY UNDER WAY IN THE CENTER FOR FINANCIAL EMPOWERMENT. GOOD MORNING EVERYONE THE CENTER FOR FINANCIAL EMPOWERMENT WORKS TO BUILD ECONOMIC STABILITY IN HOUSEHOLD WEALTH FOR LOW TO MODERATE INCOME LA COUNTY RESIDENTS. AND WE DO THAT BY EDUCATING AND EMPOWERING CONSUMERS TO MAKE INFORMED FINANCIAL CHOICES BUILDING SYSTEMIC LONG TERM CHANGES THAT ADVANCE WEALTH EQUITY AND HELPING TO FACILITATE CAPACITY BUILDING FOR LOCAL NONPROFITS THAT DELIVER SERVICES AND COUNTY DEPARTMENTS AS WELL. SO ONE EXAMPLE OF HOW WE WORK TO EDUCATE- YOUNG ADULTS WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH TRANSITION AGE USE SO ROUGHLY SPEAKING YOUTH BETWEEN SIXTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR ON BECAUSE THEY ARE A VERY HIGH RISK FOR BEING VICTIMS OF A FINANCIAL EXPLOITATION. WE WORK WITH TRANSITION AGE YOUTH THAT ARE EXITING THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM WE PROVIDE CONSUMER PROTECTION AND FINANCIAL EDUCATION WORKSHOPS TO USE TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE READY TO TRANSITION INTO ADULTHOOD. AS A CONSUMER SAVVY ADULT AND A FINANCIALLY EMPOWER ADULT. WE ALSO HOLD WORKSHOPS FOR YOUTH WHOSE PARENTS RECEIVED PUBLIC BENEFITS AS A WAY OF ADDRESSING GENERATIONAL POVERTY THAT WE OFTEN SEE WITHIN OUR DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SOCIAL SERVICES. AND THEN IN ADDITION TO THOSE WE ALSO WORK WITH FOSTER USED TO CLEAR THEIR CREDIT REPORTS ON BECAUSE WE HAVE FOUND THAT AT TIMES UNFORTUNATELY NGUYEN FOSTER YOUTH ARE IN THE SYSTEM THEY MAY BE VULNERABLE TO BEING VICTIMS OF ID THEFT. AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AT THE TIME OF EMANCIPATION THEY LEAVE WITH A CLEAN A CREDIT REPORT THAT WILL NOT BE AN ADDITIONAL BARRIER THAT IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO BE. SELF SUFFICIENT ADULT APPOINTMENTS XIN. ALSO JUST A FEW EXAMPLES OF SOME OF THE EDUCATION WORK THAT WE DO. SO WHEN WE STARTED TO GET THE INFORMATION WE FOUND- THE CENTER FOR RESPONSIBLE LENDING- HAS. FOUND THAT A FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS IMPACT- LOW INCOME FAMILIES THE MOST WOMEN IN AFRICAN AMERICANS AND SO WHEN WE STARTED TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT'S AVAILABLE SOME OF THE DATA PIECES- WE FOUND THAT THE MAJORITY 40% OF THE STUDENTS- THAT ARE ATTENDING THE FOR PROFIT COLLEGES. ARE NOT JUST FOR PROFIT COLLEGES BUT THERE THERE. NOT THE HIGHEST RANKING SCHOOLS AND SO THEY'RE ENDING UP WITH STUDENT DEBT SOME OF THEM ARE NOT GRADUATING COMPLETING A DEGREE OR ARE UNABLE TO SECURE AND STABLE EMPLOYMENT EMPLOYMENT THAT WILL GENERATE THE INCOME NEEDED TO PAY THE DEBT. AND SO. AS WE WERE GOING THROUGH SOME OF THE STORIES AND SOME OF THE CASES THAT WE HAD I'M STARTING IN ABOUT TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WHEN THE SCHOOLS WHEN MANY OF THE PRIVATE SCHOOL STARTED TO CLOSE. OUR WHAT WE WERE FINDING IS THAT THE STUDENTS WERE AT A LOSS CITY GENERALLY RECEIVED A LETTER IN THE MAIL WITH VERY LITTLE INSTRUCTION AND SO OUR INVESTIGATORS ARE CONSUMER ADVOCATES- THEN HAD TO SUPPORT WITH GUIDANCE IN NAVIGATING- WHETHER IT WAS. DIRECTLY WITH THE SCHOOL OR WITH CREDIT BUREAUS IN TERMS OF WHAT THEIR OPTIONS WERE TO DISSOLVE- THE DEBT THAT THEY HAD AND KURT SO WE KNOW THAT TO THEIR ENTERING THE SCHOOLS AT A HIGHER RATE AND WE KNOW THAT THEIR LEAVING THE SCHOOLS WITH HIGHER DEBT. AND MANY TIMES ARE NOT SECURING ARMS I QUIT PAYING JOBS IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO REPAY I HAVEN'T THE DEBT. AS DONATION MENTIONED IDENTITY THEFT IS ALSO A BIG FACTOR IT IS ANOTHER A SECTOR IN TERMS OF OUR CASELOAD THAT COMES IN- FOLKS THAT FEEL LIKE SOMEONE. ATTEND HOUSEHOLD ARMY MAY HAVE USED THEIR IDENTITY TO SECURE THAT. ARM AND SO THOSE AGAIN CASES THAT ARE VERY PREVALENT. I'M A BIG SOURCE IN A BIG NUMBER OF THE CASES THAT WE WERE SEEING- LIKE I MENTIONED EARLIER WERE AROUND SCAMS. AND SO UNFORTUNATELY WITH SOCIAL MEDIA AND SOCIAL MEDIA INFLUENCERS ARE WE HAVE FOLKS IT- VALIDATING SOME OF THESE. THESE AGENCIES THAT ALLEGE THEY CAN SECURE- DEBT FORGIVENESS FOR THE STUDENTS AND THEY DON'T KNOW THAT WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY DOING IS ENTERING INTO FORBEARANCE SO IF THE STUDENT AND THE BORROWER IS LUCKY THEY WILL CALL US FIRST TO VERIFY IF THIS IS A LEGITIMATE COMPANY- BUT MOST TIMES ARE CALLING ONCE THEY'VE ALREADY SIGNED SOME SORT OF CONTRACT. AND ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEIR OPTIONS ARE NOW- THE OTHER PIECE TO ALSO CONSIDER IS THAT WANTS TO STUDENTS MAYBE THEY WERE ON THE RIGHT PATH FOR A DEBT FORGIVENESS PROGRAM BUT ONCE YOU'VE SIGNED ON TO A DIFFERENT PROGRAM. WHAT ARE THE THINGS YOU DO IS YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHTS TO GO BACK AND SO AGAIN WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THAT ADVANTAGE OF THE DEBT FORGIVENESS. IT BECOMES VERY SMALL AND WE START TO THINK ABOUT I'M THE ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND WHO ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS ADVOCATES TO HELP THEM NAVIGATE THE SYSTEMS TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE DECISIONS THAT THEY'RE MAKING SO. AGAIN AS VIC DOT THINKING ABOUT YOUR IN A VULNERABLE SITUATION YOU ARE. TRYING TO FIND THE RIGHT RESOURCES TO HELP SUPPORT I'M FINE NOW SITUATION AT THE MOMENT BUT LONG TERM YOU END UP IN A MUCH- MORE SEVERE COMMISSION BECAUSE NOW CREDIT SCORE PROBABLY IMPACTED. THE OPTIONS ARE MUCH MORE LIMITED IN TERMS OF WHAT OUR APARTMENT CAN ACTUALLY DO AT THAT POINT SO WE HAD SUCCESS RATES WITH SCHOOLS. WERE WE CLOSING BECAUSE THERE WERE READY FOR THAT BOB THIS IS DAN HOW POTENTIALLY SIGNED ON TO A MEMORY DIMM OF CAM IN THE OPTION. IT IN THOSE SITUATE INTO DEPARTMENT SERVICEMEN AS GOT. I'M ACTUALLY IN THE PAST TO GET HER FOR IT THE CASE. I'M OUT TURN IT BACK OVER TO YOU DON YOU SHOULD TO TALK ABOUT THE POLICY WORK THAT WE CAN ON RECENTLY. ABSOLUTELY ANGEL NINETY BORDER THERE'S HI THE FACT THAT RISEN FROM THE DEAD IMPACT INCLUDING STUDENTS AND HIGH COSTS LENDING AND WHEN I SAY HIGH COST LENDING I'M REFERRING TO AUTO TITLE LOANS PAYDAY LOANS AND OTHER SMALL DOLLAR LENDING- PRODUCTS THAT HAVE INCREDIBLY HIGH APR SO USUALLY IN THE TRIPLE DIGITS WE'VE FOCUSED ON PROTECTING CONSUMERS FROM THESE FINANCIAL PRODUCTS. AND PROVIDING THEM WITH EDUCATION SO THAT THEY CAN BE BETTER INFORMED AS TO THE RISK OF THESE PRODUCTS. THIS YEAR THE COUNTY SPONSORED ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE THIRTY NINE ALSO KNOWN AS THE FAIR ACCESS TO CREDIT ACTS AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE MONN WHICH WAS SIGNED INTO LAW BY GOVERNOR NEWSOME AND THIS BILL WILL CAP INTEREST RATES AT THIRTY SIX PERCENT. PLUS FED FUND RATE ON LOANS BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED AND NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED NINETY NINE DOLLARS BECAUSE WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR RESEARCH IS THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE SHORT ON CASH AND ANY MONEY RIGHT AWAY. THEY MAY GO TO THEIR LOCAL- PAYDAY LENDING STOREFRONT TO GET A PAYDAY LOAN BUT ULTIMATELY BE STEERED INTO A HIGHER DOLLAR LOAN ABOVE THE THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR PAYDAY LIMIT BECAUSE OF THOSE LOANS UNBEKNOWNST TO THEM. CURRENTLY AT THE TIME DID NOT HAVE AN INTEREST RATE CAPS SO AB FIVE THIRTY NINE WILL EMPLOY THIRTY SIX PER INTEREST RATE CAPS TO PROVIDE IT CONSUMER PROTECTION ALL. FIND PRODUCTS. THE COUNTY ALSO SPONSORED A- BILL THREE SEVEN SIX. OUR BILL OF RIGHTS. BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE WHICH WOULD CREATE STATE STANDARDS TO REGULATE STUDENT LOAN SERVICES AND INCREASED CONSUMER PROTECTIONS FOR STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS. ADDITIONALLY OUR DEPARTMENT IS WORKING TO IDENTIFY SAFE AND AFFORDABLE FINANCIAL PRODUCTS THAT COULD BE A HEALTHIER ALTERNATIVE TO A TRADITIONAL PAYDAY LOAN SO RIGHT NOW WE ARE WORKING WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS INCLUDING LOCAL CREDIT UNIONS TO TRY AND DEVELOP A SAFER ALTERNATIVE LENDING PRODUCTS. AND ULTIMATELY OUR GOAL IS TO FOSTER PARTNERSHIPS ACROSS SECTORS- BY LEVERAGING COLLECTIVE ACTION TO IMPROVE THE FINANCIAL PRACTICES PROVIDE ACCESS TO FAIR AFFORDABLE CREDIT AND PROMOTE FINING TO EMPOWERMENT FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. SO WITH THAT WILL TURN IT BACK OVER TO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR US THANK YOU. I'M TO AS YOU MENTIONED WE DID MAKE SOME PROGRESS THIS YEAR WITH AB FIVE FIVE THIRTY NINE IN TERMS OF CRACKING DOWN ON PREDATORY LENDING WHICH I THINK IS A- MUCH. STEP FORWARD. HOWEVER THERE WERE A COUPLE OF OTHER BELLS THAT YOU MAY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THAT. I DID NOT MAKE IT THROUGH THE PROCESS- WHICH WERE TENDING TO ADDRESS. FOR PROFIT COLLEGES SPECIFICALLY PARTICULARLY CRACKING DOWN ON SOME DECEPTIVE MARKETING PRACTICES. I'M I THINK THAT IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT THOSE WILL BE REINTRODUCED THIS SESSION EITHER HIM. FROM THE PREVIOUS AUTHORS ARE OR BY OTHER AUTHORS AND- I'M JUST I THINK WE'RE GONNA NEED. A LOT HAS HAPPENED SUPPORT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE EFFECTIVELY ADVOCATING WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO MAKE PROGRESS ON THAT AREA BECAUSE- I THINK AS YOU POINTED OUT. SO MANY THE PEOPLE THAT COME TO YOU. IT'S BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY THESE FOR PROFIT COLLEGES AND- I THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE THAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE. AND AS POLICY MAKERS CAN DO. I INCHED HER THAT WE'RE PROTECTING PEOPLE FROM. US THIS AMP EQUALLY PRESS. A PRACTICE SAYS. ON IT IN ADDITION TO AYE THINKS LEGISLATIVE STEPS. I FEEL LIKE WE CAN ALSO DO MORE. TO GIVE POTENTIAL BORROWERS JUST BETTER INFORMATION ABOUT. THE QUALITY OF THE PROGRAM THAT THEY'RE ENTERING INTO WHETHER THAT'S- DEFAULT RATES ARE AND- EARNING RIGHT. I'M YOU AS YOU TALK TO CONSUMER AS YOU TALK TO PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DO YOU. FROM YOUR FIRST OF WHAT CAN I. DO TO GIVE PEOPLE BETTER INFORMATION AND HELP THEM MAKE CHOICES NOT ALL RATE THE SCAM. SO WHEN THINGS AREN'T THAT THE CFE THERE ARE WAS SUPPOSED A SERIES OF FOCUS GROUPS. AND SO WE WERE LOOKING AT HIGH COST LOANS SPECIFICALLY UP AS THEY THINK ABOUT SOME OF THE LESSONS WE TOOK AWAY FROM THAT- DONATION YOU CAN SPEAK MORE TO THAT IS. WHAT WE HEARD BACK VERY CLEARLY IS THE- A MARKETING STRATEGY THAT FOCUSES ON THE INTEREST RATE OR THAT FOCUSES AND FEELS LIKE IT'S A SHAMING TACTIC. IS NOT EFFECTIVE AND SO BECAUSE OPTIONS IN MOST OF THESE COMMUNITIES ARE ALREADY LIMITED THEY'RE VERY AWARE- THAT THIS IS PROBABLY THE ONLY ACCESS POINT THAT THEY HAVE TO HIGHER EDUCATION WHICH IS WHAT THEY'VE BEEN TOLD RIGHT. GO TO SCHOOL YOU'LL HAVE HIGHER YOU'LL EARN HIGHER INCOME- BUT WHAT WE'RE AT THE PART THAT WE'RE NOT HAVING A VERY CLEAR CONVERSATION ABOUT IS THE DEBT THAT COMES AFTER THAT- CHALLENGES WITH MAYBE GRADUATING. AND SO WE CAN FIND THE RIGHT- THE RIGHT TALKING POINTS IN THE RIGHT MESSAGING TO REALLY CONVEY TO STUDENTS. I'M ABOUT WHAT THEIR OPTIONS TRULY ARE IT COMES FROM A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE DIFFERENT FROM OUR CONCERNS AS WE THINK ABOUT INTEREST RATES AND FEES. I'M AN INCOME IS THAT SADDAM. CAN WE THINK ABOUT HOW TO DELAY THAT- AN- IMMEDIATE NEED FOR A DEGREE YOU KNOW IS IT A FOUR MONTH PROGRAM IS THAT IT WHEN YOU'RE PROGRAM. CAN THINK OTHER STRATEGIES TO REALLY HELP MAXIMIZE THE STUDENT'S POTENTIAL I'M NOT A GET LOSE MONEY IN THE PROCESS. AND WE THINK WE HEARD A LOT. THE PHOTO IS. LIKE WAS DESIGNED FOR THEM WHICH IS VERY SHOCKING RIGHT BECAUSE WE THINK ABOUT THOSE PLACES AS YOU KNOW QUICK YOU COME IN FIVE MINUTES THE ASK VERY LITTLE QUESTIONS THEY JUST WANT TO KNOW IF YOU HAVE SOME SORT OF IN COM MAYBE IT'S THEIR STUDENT LOAN CHECK THAT IS YOU KNOW COUNTING AS AS THAT SOURCE OF INCOME AND SO WE THINK ABOUT DEVELOPING APPROPRIATE CAMPAIGNS THAT HELP GET THAT TO THE STUDENTS WE ALSO LEARNED THAT THERE ARE MORE LIKELY TO RECEIVE THE INFORMATION FROM TRUSTED SOURCES SO ARE THEY PART OF ALREADY CONNECTED TO A SCHOOL ARE THE PART IT MAY BE A CHURCH OR THEY- WERE NOT. AFFECT HOW DO WE THE MESSAGING TO THEM IN THIS IS A. STATE IS YOU KNOW AT. THE BUS SHELTER OR AT THE TRAIN SO THINKING ABOUT WAYS IN WHICH WE MAXIMIZE SOME OF OUR MARKETING DOLLARS TO REALLY HIT THE MESSAGE HOME. AND WHAT ARE SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT THAT YOU HAVE ROTH AND IMPLEMENTED THAT YOU FEEL HAVE BEEN MOST ACTIVE. IN TERMS OF THE HIGH COST LOANS RIGHT NOW WE'RE AN EXPLORATORY PHASE AND SO WE ARE DOING SOME HOMEWORK WITH SOME ARE FOR NOT NONPROFIT PARTNERS TO EXPLORE WHAT ARE AT AN ATTENTIONAL PRODUCTS. ODD LOAN PRODUCTS FOR SOME OF OUR CONSUMERS AND SO THERE'S A FEW NOT LOCAL NONPROFITS TRUSTWORTHY NONPROFITS THAT ARE PILOTING- LOW COST INTEREST RATE LOANS I ONE OF THEM FOR EXAMPLE IS FOCUSED ON SMALL BUSINESSES. ARE THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS TO TRADITIONAL CAPITAL AND THEY CAP THEY'RE INTERESTED 8% ARE WE HAVE ANOTHER NONPROFIT PARTNER ARMED THAT PARTNERED WITH THE FIN TECH COMPANY IS EXPLORING WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE TO. AND THEY WOULDN'T CALL IT FINANCING BUT SUPPORTING A BARBER TO REPAY BACK. I EIGHTY LOANS AND HAVING AN INTEREST RATE ALSO FIXED ON THAT OR MODELING IT LIKE A SAVINGS PROGRAM. AND SO WE THINK THAT THERE'S FOLKS OUT THERE THERE ARE DOING CREATIVE THINGS WE JUST NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHERE GOVERNMENT CAN FIT IN THAT EQUATION DO WE SUPPORT IT IS IT'S A SUSTAINABLE IN THAT WAY OR IS THERE A PRODUCT. THAT AS A COUNTY AGENCY WE CAN LOOK AT EXPLORING AND CREATING. AND I WOULD ADD THAT THE COUNTY IS A MINIMUM WAGE CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE ACTIVE ARE HONEST WORK FAIR CAMPAIGN. AND WHAT HAS MADE THAT SO ACTIVE IS OUR ABILITY TO LEVERAGE LOCAL NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS SO WE WANTED TO INFORM. LA COUNTY RESIDENTS SAY HEY THERE'S A NEW MINIMUM WAGE ORDINANCE HERE'S THE NEW PAY SCHEDULE BUT NOT JUST RELYING ON OUR OWN VOICE TO GET THE WORD OUT THE BUILDING A CADRE. OF DOZENS OF NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO HELP US BE THAT THE MESSENGER AGAIN GOING BACK TO THE TRUSTED MESSENGER APPROACH. AND THEN FROM THE OTHER PANEL WE TALKED A BIT ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE'RE LEAVING. SO MUCH MONEY ON THE TABLE AS A STATE. AND AS YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE FOLKS THAT COME TO YOU THEY THEY FEEL LIKE MAYBE THEY'RE ONLY OPTIONS ARE. THESE YOU KNOW HI COST FOR PROFIT COLLEGES OR THESE REALLY HIGH I. HI COSTS LENDING PRODUCTS. IS THAT TRUE OR ARE WE JUST NOT DOING A GOOD ENOUGH JOB OF. LETTING PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THEY ACTUALLY QUALIFY FOR. ATC SO SURE THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT IS THE NATION'S LARGEST ANTI POVERTY PROGRAM AND EVEN THOUGH IT'S THE NATION'S LARGEST ANTI POVERTY PROGRAM RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS GOES AND CLAIMED EVERY YEAR IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES IS A REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT IT'S A WAY TO PUT MORE MONEY BACK INTO THE HANDS OF SOME OF OUR HARDEST WORKING INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PUT IT ON YOUR INCOME TAX RETURN IF YOU QUALIFY YET THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN FAMILIES DON'T SO I DO THINK THAT OUT REACH IS CRITICAL BUT AGAIN IT'S- THE RIGHT. OUT EACH RIDE IS THING NONPROFIT IT'S DOING INNOVATIVE THINGS LIKE TEXT MESSAGE CAMPAIGNS AND NOT JUST RELYING ON CONSTITUENTS TO COME TO US CAN ASK QUESTIONS BUT US LEVERAGING WHATEVER RESOURCES WE HAVE TO PUSH OUT CONTENT. YEAH AND THE TIME THAT I WOULD MAKE BACK IS PART OF WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM SOME OF OUR PARTNERS. IS THAT WE CAN SUPPORT OUR REGION WE CAN. IMPROVE OUR MARKETING BUT THEN ALSO SUPPORTING THE CAPACITY BUILDING ON THE BACKEND SO THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY ABSORB THE INFLUX OF NEW FILERS AND SO AS I THINK ABOUT YOUR QUESTION IS ARE WE DOING A GOOD. JOB OF INFORMING PEOPLE AREN'T WE CAN PROBABLY DO A BETTER JOB OF DOING THAT BUT THEN ALSO HOW DO WE TRAIN AND WORK WITH. HIGH SCHOOL KIDS SLIPPERS MAYBE IT'S A COLLEGE COUNTS. TO IMPROVE PASSED TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT SURE THIS IS JUST A FORM BUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF WHETHER THAT STUDENT FILLED OUT CORRECTLY OR NOT. GOES FAR GREATER THAN JUST YOU KNOW THOSE FIFTEEN MINUTES THAT THEY GET TO SPEND WITH THE STUDENT. AND SO THAT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS NOT JUST FOR THIS VERY MOMENT WITH THE STUDENT IN THEIR FIRST YEAR BUT THEN LONG TERM THEIR GRADUATION RATES THE- FACT. THAT THEY WILL CARRY FORWARD AND SO I THINK THERE'S WORK THAT WE CAN DEFINITELY DO DO I. BY ALLIED TO CAN HELP SUPPORT IN THIS EFFORT. AND THEN. WE TALKED ABOUT THE- ISSUE AB RIGHT SWITCH YOUR YOU'VE BEEN A SPONSOR. I HAVE AND I KNOW PEOPLE. TO WORK HARD ON NEXT YEAR IN ADDITION TO THAT PIECE OF LEGISLATION ARE THERE SPECIFIC. NO LEGISLATIVE OUR POLICY FIXES THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE AS INTRODUCED NEXT YEAR. WE'VE WE'VE NOT WE HAVEN'T DISCUSSED THOROUGHLY ADAM BUT WE ALWAYS COME BACK TO CONSUMER PROTECTION AND HOW DO WE TIGHTENED THE ROPES AROUND SOME OF THESE THINGS SO FOR EXAMPLE- WE WERE ALREADY HEARING ABOUT. WORK AROUNDS THAT SOME FOLKS ARE COMING UP WITH AROUND THE 36% CAP AND SO HOW DO WE THINK JUSTICE CREATIVELY AS THEY ARE I'M TO TIGHTEN- SOME OF THOSE LOOSE ENDS. AND CONSUMER PROTECTION FOR US IS BIG OUT TO ENSURE THAT- WE'RE NOT JUST BE REACTIVE WE CAN BE PROACTIVE IN IN OUR APPROACH. EXCELLENT GREAT WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH AGAIN FOR BEING HERE AND DIVE FOR THE WORK THAT YOU DO YOU. THINK YOU ARE ON BEHALF OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS. RIGHT SO I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND CALL UP OUR OF FINAL PANEL. AS THE AS SUBJECT IS BUILDING SOLUTIONS AND WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME INTO THE PERIOD POLICY ANALYST. AT THE INSTITUTE FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS. AND CAP WHILE BACK THE CIVIL RIGHTS COUNCIL OF FROM THE STUDENT POWER PROTECTION CENTER. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. RIGHT I WOULD LIKE TO START OUT BY NEXT WEEK EVERYONE ELSE IS VERY POOR ASSEMBLY THIS. AND REALLY TAKING A LOOK AT THE MEDICAL ISSUES ARE. I AM HERE TO PROVIDE SOME INFORMATION TO ECHO- SOME OF THE EARLIER CONCERNS WE HEARD- ARMED WITH INFORMATION ON HOW FOR PROFIT COLLEGES TYPICALLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE STUDENT STRUGGLES OF CALIFORNIA. THE INSTITUTE OF COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS IS A NONPROFIT NONPARTISAN RESEARCH AND POLICY ORGANIZATION WITH HEADQUARTERS IN OAKLAND IN WASHINGTON WE FOCUS ON FEDERAL AND CALIFORNIA STATE POLICY AIMED AT IMPROVING COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY EQUITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. SO THAT'S HOW WE COME TO THIS WORK- I SPECIFICALLY LOOK AT FOR PROFIT WORK AT STUDENTS OFTEN- AND STUDENT AT IS A PROBLEM FOR MANY STUDENTS BUT ITS IMPACT CAN BE ESPECIALLY OUTSIDE FOR STUDENTS OF FOR PROFIT COLLEGES. I'M GRADUATES OF FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE DEBT THAN THEIR PEERS FROM PUBLIC AND NONPROFIT SCHOOLS AND THEY GENERALLY END UP WITH MORE DEBT OVERALL FROM THEIR EDUCATIONS. NEARLY 65% OF STUDENTS TO CALIFORNIA FOR YOUR FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS TAKE OUT LOANS TO PAY FOR THEIR EDUCATION WHICH IS ALMOST TWICE AS MANY AS THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT ATTEND PUBLIC PROGRAMS. AB GRADUATES FROM FOUR YEAR FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS ALSO LEAVE WITH AN AVERAGE OF THIRTY ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE DOLLARS IN DEBT WHICH IS TWICE AS MUCH AS STUDENTS GRADUATING FROM PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES IN CALIFORNIA. PARTICULARLY TROUBLING OR THE STRUGGLES THE STUDENTS FACE WHEN IT COMES BE PAYING THEIR DEBT OUT WELL STUDENTS ENROLLED AT FOR PROFIT COLLEGES REPRESENT ONLY 9% OF HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA. THE ACCOUNT FOR HALF OF THE STUDENT LOAN DEFAULTS IN THE STATE. AT THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION RECENTLY RELEASED UPDATED DATA ON HOW WELL BORROWERS ARE PAYING DOWN THEIR DEBT. AND MORE THAN HALF 55% OF BORROWERS FROM CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS WERE NOT PAYING DOWN THEIR PRINCIPLES. HAD ATTENDED FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS- WHEN CALIFORNIA STUDENTS ARE HARMED BY FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS IT IS LOW INCOME FAMILIES AFRICAN AMERICANS AND WOMEN THAT ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED. PROFIT WHICH IS OUR LOW INCOME FIFTEEN PER CENT ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN AND SIXTY THREE ARE FEMALE THESE ALL HIGHER THAN THE AVERAGE PERCENTAGE IS WHEN COMPARED TO PUBLIC AND NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS. BAD ACTORS SECTOR HAVE HISTORICALLY TARGETED THE MOST DISADVANTAGED GROUPS THE STUDENTS MOST IN NEED OF THE BENEFITS HIGHER EDUCATION CAN OFFER BUT WHO CAN LEAST AFFORD THE STAT. CONCERNS ABOUT POOR QUALITY PROGRAMS RESULTING IN ON AFFORDABLE DEBT LET THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TO CREATE THE GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT RULE WHICH REQUIRED POORLY PERFORMING PROGRAMS TO IMPROVE IN ORDER TO STAY ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID. DATA MADE AVAILABLE UNDER THE RULE SHOWED THAT AMONG CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS ALONE MORE THAN FIFTY SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS GRADUATED FROM THE WORST PERFORMING PROGRAMS VIRTUALLY ALL OF THEM FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS. I AND THOSE STUDENTS HAD NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT TO REPAY. THE ROLE UNFORTUNATELY HAS SINCE BEEN ROLLED BACK BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. THE ADMINISTRATION HAS ALSO TAKEN STEPS TO SCALE BACK RULES PROVIDING STUDENT LOAN JUST CHARGES TO STUDENTS IN CONNECTION WITH FRAUD OR OTHER ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES OF THEIR COLLEGES. AND IT IS NOT PROCESSING THE CLAIMS OF TWO HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND APPLICANTS FOR BORROWER DEFENSE. STATE LEVEL ACCOUNTING SO THE CLAIMS BY STATE FOR BOTH TOTAL CLAIMS SUBMITTED AND THE CLAIM STILL PENDING SHOW THAT MORE THAN ONE IN FIVE BAR DEFENSE CLAIMANTS ARE FROM CALIFORNIA. AT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S OWN VERSION OF THE BAR DEFENSE RULE FINALIZED IN AUGUST WILL LEAVE OUR WORST REPAIR 897% OF ALL OF THE DEBT INCURRED AS THE RESULT OF COLLEGES MISCONDUCT NOT AS ACCORDING TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S OWN CALCULATIONS. DESPITE ALL OF THIS CALIFORNIA HAS TAKEN STEPS TO ADDRESS THE RISKS FACED BY STUDENTS OF FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS AND IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE STATE PASSED THREE BILLS WHICH WILL ALLOW CALIFORNIA TO STEP FORWARD. EVEN AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS STEPPED BACK. ON THE FIRST OF THOSE BILLS IS AB THIRTEEN FORTY- WHICH WAS AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU- AND THAT ESTABLISHED A PATH TOWARDS MAKING MORE RELIABLE STATE VERIFY DATA ABOUT POST COLLEGE EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS AT FOR PROFIT CALL. IN CALIFORNIA FOR THE FIRST TIME. AT THIS IMPROVED DATA WILL BENEFIT BOTH STUDENTS AND LAWMAKERS AS THEY EVALUATE WHICH STUDENTS WHICH SCHOOLS ARE PREPARING CALIFORNIANS FOR GOOD JOBS AND WHICH ONES ARE NOT. OUR SECOND AB THIRTEEN FORTY FOUR FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER REBEKAH POWER QUE HAN- IMPROVED THE STATE'S OVERSIGHT PROCESS FOR OUT OF STATE ONLINE SCHOOLS WHICH IN ROLE CALIFORNIANS. OUT MOST CALIFORNIANS ENROLLED IN ONLINE PROGRAMS ACTUALLY ATTEND CALIFORNIA BASED SCHOOLS WE DO A VERY GOOD JOB OF SERVING OUR OWN STUDENT BODY. BUT THE STUDENTS WHO ENROLL IN PROGRAMS OUTSIDE OF THE STATE ARE AT THE SCHOOLS WHERE STUDENTS ARE LESS LIKELY TO PAY DOWN THEIR DEBT AND MORE LIKELY TO DEFRAUD ON IT. AT RETAINING AND USING FOR HIS AUTHORITY TO OVERSEE THE SCHOOLS IS A CRITICAL STEP TO PROTECTING CALIFORNIANS FROM AFFORDABLE THAT. I AND THE LAST BILL AB THIRTEEN FORTY SIX FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA EXPANDED RELIEF FOR STUDENTS SEEKING TO REBUILD THEIR LIVES AFTER THEIR SCHOOLS CLOSE. UP GOING FORWARD STUDENTS WILL BE ABLE TO RECLAIM RELIEF FOR ANY DEBT INCURRED TO OBTAIN THEIR EDUCATION WHETHER IT WAS USED TO PAY FOR TUITION HOUSING CHILD CARE OR ANY OTHER RECOGNIZED COST OF ATTENDANCE. TWENTY TWENTY IS GOING TO BRING MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CALIFORNIA TO IMPROVE OVERSIGHT FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS. TWENTY TWENTY IS THE YEAR THE BUREAU FOR PRIVATE POST. EDUCATION THE AGENCY CHARGED WITH OVERSIGHT FOR CAP ARGUES FOR PROFITS. WILL BE UP FOR SUNSET REVIEW AND RE AUTHORIZATION. THAT PROCESS HAS HISTORICALLY REPRESENTS OPPORTUNITY TO ABOUT THE WAIT WHAT IS WORKING WELL AT THE BUREAU. AND WHAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT. TKS LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE IN TWENTY TWENTY ON THESE ISSUES PARTNERING WITH YOU TO ENSURE THE BUREAU IS RE AUTHORIZED IN A WAY THAT ENHANCES OVERSIGHT OF COLLEGES. ALONG WITH PROTECTIONS FOR STUDENTS. OUT WHILE ANY AGENCY HAS ROOM TO IMPROVE THE PURE AND ESSENTIAL OVERSIGHT AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ROLE FOR SOME CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS. AND IT'S IMPERATIVE STUDENTS BE SERVED BY THE STATE OF CALIPARI. THOUGHTS AT ARMS AFTER. THE NEXT. WE WILL TAKE SOME QUESTIONS. A GOOD MORNING AGAIN AND BEFORE IT STARTED AGAIN I WANT. EVERYONE SAID JUST IN HERE AGAINST YOUR OWN BEACON ARTS WERE HOLDING OF THIS HEARING GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT THESE ISSUES- AGAIN MY NAME IS CAT WHILE BACK I'M A COUNSEL AT THE CEDAR BAR PROTECTION CENTER- WORK OKAY ON CIVIL RIGHTS IN FAIRLY ISSUES AND THE SUIT THAT CRISIS. OUR PARTY JOIN JOIN SB. FIVE YEARS. AND SO. I'M HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT OUR NATION'S ONE POINT SIX TRILLION DOLLARS STUDENT DEBT CRISIS THAT'S AFFECTING NEARLY FORTY FIVE MILLION BARBERS AND- AS WE'VE HEARD- THROUGHOUT TODAY THIS CRISIS IS TOUCHING BARS IN EVERY. EVERY CORNER OF OUR COUNTRY INCLUDING NEARLY FOUR MILLION BARS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- THE AVERAGE TO LEARN THAT BALLOTS NATIONWIDE ISN'T IS IN EXCESS OF THIRTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS. OVER NINE MILLION BORROWERS ARE IN THE FALL AND MILLION MORE HEARING TO FALL STATUS. AND AS I SAID BEFORE AND AS HAS BEEN SHARED HERE TODAY. THE NUMBERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA ARE EQUALLY DIRE WITH- OVER ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY BILLION DOLLARS IN OUTSTANDING DEBT. AND FIFTEEN POINT 4% OF STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS SEVERELY DELINQUENT. ON THEIR LIVES IN THE STATE- ACROSS THE COUNTRY OVER ONE MILLION BORROWERS DEFAULTED LAST YEAR ALONE- THAT'S ONE BORROWER DEFAULTING EVERY TWENTY EIGHT SECONDS. AND AT THIS CRISIS UNFOLD IN NEIGHBORHOODS ALL ACROSS OUR COUNTRY BAR WAS THE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR FEEL THIS BURDEN MOST ACUTELY SO THERE REALLY EXPERIENCE SOME EXPERIENCING SOME OF THE MOST SEVERE CONSEQUENCES. ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CRISIS- THROUGHOUT THE LIFECYCLE OF THEIR LOANS BORROWERS A COLOR BASICALLY THINK IMPAIR ST PETE PROGRESS. AND COMPOUND HISTORIC SOCIOLECT SOCIO ECONOMIC INEQUALITY FACED BY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. MORE THAN 90% OF AFRICAN AMERICAN AND 72% OF LATINO STUDENTS FIND THEIR HIGHER EDUCATION IT ALLOWS. A COMPARISON WITH 66% OF THEIR WHITE PEERS. THE AVERAGE WHITE BORROWER PAYS DOWN ALMOST NINETY FIVE ANOTHER. TWENTY YEARS. COLLEGE AND THAT'S A STARK CONTRAST TO THEIR BLACK PEERS HE'S STILL- AFTER THE SAME PERIOD. RECENT RESEARCH FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF NEW YORK HAS PROVIDED COMPREHENSIVE DATA THAT FURTHER EXAMINES THESE DISPARITIES ALONG PERFORMANCE FOR BARS OF COLOUR. BUT ONLY ONE COMMUNITIES HAVE THE HIGHEST AND FASTEST GROWING. STUDENT LOAN BALANCES WITH AN AVERAGE BALANCE OF THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH IS ALSO GREATER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE DATA ALSO POINTS TO LEARNING TRENDS REPAYMENT DISPARITIES DEFAULT RATES ARE APPROXIMATELY SEVENTEEN POINT 7% MAJORITY BLACK ZIP CODES ABOUT 13% AND- LET'S UNION LATINO MAJORITIES OF CODES AND THAT'S COMPARED WHITE ZIP CODES- IT HERE CALIFORNIA. THE SAME RING TRUE WITH REGARD TO BORROW DISTRESS THE FINDINGS FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK BANK. IN SAN FRANCISCO SHOW THE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES FACING BARS THE COLOR IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO I'M HERE LOS ANGELES A DEFAULT RATES A PROFOUNDLY MINORITIES OF CODES OR DOUBLE THOSE. AND WOULD ONLY WHITE ZIP CODES- NEARING THE DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS HERE ACROSS THE COUNTRY ALSO THE BAY AREA CIP HAS THE HIGHEST LEVEL DELINQUENCY AND A FALL ALSO HAVE. LARGER PERCENTAGES OF BLACK AND LATINO RESIDENTS. THE SURVEY. CO FOUNDER BAY AREA COMMUNITIES WITH THE LARGEST PERCENTAGES OF BLACK AND LATINO RESIDENTS HAD. NINETEEN POINT FIFTEEN POINT 3% OF OUR WAS IN THE FALL. AND SINCE TWO THOUSAND THREE EIGHT TWENTY SIX POINT 9% OF BORROWERS IN THIS COMMUNITIES ON THE FAULT ON A STUDENT LOAN. AND THAT'S ABOUT THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN NEIGHBORHOODS- WITH THE LOWEST PERCENTAGES. OF BLACK AND LATINO RESIDENTS. SO WITH A LOT OF- SIMILARITIES TO THE MORTGAGE CRISIS OF THE PAST DECADE WE'RE SAYING THAT- PREDATORY ACTORS ARE PREYING UPON BARS OF COLOUR. SEEING THEM SIMPLY AS A MEANS TO GET RICH- INTO EIGHTEEN HOURS OF THE CALIFORNIA SUED NOW. FOR THEIR SERVICE DECEPTIVE SERVICING PRACTICES. THAT YOU HAVE ARE OUT OF THERE RIGHT FULLER PAYMENT- SIMILARLY THIS IF YOU BE. ILLINOIS PENNSYLVANIA AND WASHINGTON SU NAVVY SIMILAR PIECES THE YEAR BEFORE- DEBT COLLECTORS ARE ALSO MORE. THIS IS AN RATES OF REPAYMENT. RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA NOW THAT ALSO SUED WELLS FARGO FOR DISCRIMINATING AGAINST QUALIFIED LOAN APPLICANTS BASED ON IMMIGRATION STATUS YEAH IN THE FACE OF ALL THIS COUNTY EVIDENCE THAT DEMONSTRATES THE NEED FOR MORE RIGOROUS OVERSIGHT IN THE INDUSTRY WE SEE THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS REALLY JUST TURNED ITS BACK ON BORROWERS- TO SEE IF. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ARE CHARGED WITH PROTECTING BARBAROUS FROM THESE COUNTLESS ENOUGH OF ABUSES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT IT BUT WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT THIS IN ACTION ISN'T REALLY ALLOWING THE INDUSTRY TO RIGHT. TO RUN. AND JUST LAST WEEK- DEMOCRACY FOR ON BEHALF OF STUDENT DEBT CRISIS AS TO THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION- FOR EXACTLY ITS DUTY TO SUPERVISE IT'S STILL IN THE MARKET- THIS LAWSUIT WAS FILED WITH SUPPORT FROM MY ORGANIZATION WHICH IS COMPRISED OF FORMER SEER. SEE IF YOU THE OFFICIALS WHO ONCE LED THIS CRITICAL OVERSIGHT WORK. SERVICE YOU CAN BE HAS PRETTY MUCH ABANDONED ITS CHARGE SUPERVISOR FEDERAL STUDENT LOAN MARKET. AND HIRED A FORMER EXECUTIVE FROM ONE OF THE NATION'S LARGEST SERVICERS AS A STUDENT LOAN OMBUDSMAN. DESPITE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS LODGED AGAINST HIS FIRM FORMER EMPLOYER. AND UNDER BETSY TO BOSS IS HOME THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAS REPEATEDLY TRIED TO BLOCK EFFORTS THE WHOLE SERVICES ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR PRACTICES. SO THE ABSENCE OF FEDERAL SUPERVISION IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT STATES AN ADVOCATE STAND IN PERFECT FARCE FROM HER KOREAN LEGAL MARKET PRACTICES THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE'RE HERE TODAY. HAVING THIS DISCUSSION AND- CALIFORNIA REALLY HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD THE NATION BY PASSING ASSEMBLY MEMBER MARK STONE AB THREE SEVENTY SIX- FOR WHICH ARE YOUR TEARS BEEN. A STRONG ADVOCATE- THIS LEGISLATION BECAUSE SPONSORED BY THE SB PC PROVIDES A MEANS FOR CALIFORNIANS GREAT PROTECTIONS FOR BARS FOR VALOR ACTION HAS WANED- THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY. IS SO IMPORTANT- IN THIS COMMITTEE CAN REALLY HELP YOU SIMPLY UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTS OF THIS CRISIS. PROVIDE A FOUNDATION FOR EVIDENCE TO JUSTIFY FURTHER ACTION. ON THIS LEGISLATOR MUST ACT FOR. THE TEACHERS HAVE BEEN BY THE RIGHTS OF PUBLIC SERVICE ON FORGIVENESS THE DISABLED VETERANS AND THEIR RIGHTS HAVE LOANS JUST HEART DISCHARGED. AND ESPECIALLY THE MILLIONS OF BARS OF COLOUR ORGANIZER STILL RIGHT. SO I HAVE MY ORDERS. OF OTHER CONSUMER ALL RIGHTS AND LABOR GROUPS. ACROSS THIS SUPPORT AB SEVENTY. ALL RIGHT. FOR THE LAWYERS OF OUR STRONG THE WAY TO THE START DATE AND IN DOING SO PAVE THE WAY FOR THE NATION TO ADDRESS THE STUDENT DEBT CRISIS IS A THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE GOT. TO BE HERE TODAY. ONE THANK YOU. AS YOU AS YOU MENTIONED I THINK- AS THE SENATE STANDS. AS STUDENT BORROWER BILL BILL OF RIGHTS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT AND ONE THAT I DO HAVE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN TAKING. IN THE TWENTY TWENTY CYCLE I'M- ARE THERE OTHER SPECIFICS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE LANDSCAPE. AND THE HUGE GAP THAT WE HAVE REALLY GIVEN BY THE ACTIONS OF THE INACTION. OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND ARE THERE OTHER THINGS THAT YOU LOOK AT AND SAY THAT IS. IT A PRIORITY THAT WE URGENTLY NEED TO ADDRESS NEXT YEAR. I CAN SPEAK AT LEAST TO THE FOR PROFIT PEAS AS I AYE FORESHADOWED A LITTLE BIT. TWENTY TWENTY IS GOING TO BE SUNSET REVIEW. EURO AT THAT DOES REPRESENTS OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY DO SOME ASSESSMENTS OF HOW OVERSIGHT IS BEING CONDUCTED FOR THESE VULNERABLE COMMUNITY. WELLS WHAT PROTECTIONS SHOULD BE IN PLACE- I THINK THAT THIS YEAR THERE ARE ACTUALLY I TALKED ABOUT THREE BILLS BUT THERE WERE OTHER BILLS THAT RELATED TO FOR PROFIT EDUCATION- AND I THINK THAT THOSE BILLS OFFER. A REALLY- GOOD PLACE TO START IN TWENTY TWENTY THERE WERE BUILT ON OUR INCENTIVE COMPENSATION THERE WAS. BILL ONLINE. THE NINETY TEN FULL THERE WAS A BILL ON THEIR TWO BILLS ON CONVERSIONS SO- COVERT FOR PROFITS OR OR FOR PROFITS THAT ARE CONVERTING TO BECOME NON PROFITS. AS WELL AS- NONPROFITS BEING PURCHASED BY FOR PROFIT SO- THERE ARE THOSE WERE A LOT OF IDEAS I THINK ALSO WE STARTED THE BALL ROLLING WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT DATING APPS TODAY- THIRTEEN FORTY ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOOSE BILL STARTED TOOK A VERY IMPORTANT FIRST STEP IN CLOSING SOME OF THOSE DATA GAPS BY MAKING. OUTCOMES DATA AVAILABLE LIKE I SAY FOR THE FIRST TIME THE STUDENTS AT FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS I THINK THAT THAT OPENS THE DOOR TO POTENTIALLY LOOKING AT COULD WE RECREATE SOMETHING LIKE THE GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT LOVE RULE AT THE STATE LEVEL. AND THAT WAS ORIGINALLY PART OF THAT BILL- AND I THINK IS A REALLY PROMISING IDEA GOING FORWARD COULD WE DO SOMETHING LIKE BORROWED DEFENSE AT THE STATE LEVEL SO THERE ARE THESE THESE OPPORTUNITIES ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN A STEP BACK. FOR CALIFORNIA REALLY STEPPED FORWARD- I THINK THOSE ARE ALL ALL IDEAS THAT. SEE IN TWENTY TWENTY. AND I'VE I'VE GOT MY PERSPECTIVE I'M CURIOUS TO KNOW YOUR PERSPECTIVE YOUR Y. HIVE WE ENCOUNTERED IT'S LIKE YOU SAID I THINK THAT THE FOR PROFIT PACKAGE WAS TEN BELLS MAY BE ALIVE AND SO. IT WAS SEVEN OKAY. SO YOU KNOW. THREE OF THEM THREE OF THEM MADE IT THROW. WHY DO YOU THINK WE'VE ENCOUNTERED. SUCH CHALLENGES WHEN IT COMES TO REGULATING FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS HERE THE FORMULA- I THINK. IT IS- IT'S A SEGMENT OF STUDENTS THAT HASN'T HISTORICALLY PATRICK MENTIONED SEILING EARLIER I THINK THAT THAT. OFTEN WE TEND TO FOCUS ON DIFFERENT SEGMENTS OF EDUCATION AND HIGHER EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA. I AM REALLY EXCITED. HERE MULTIPLE PEOPLE TALK. THE RIVER SEINE. HARM THAT IS HAPPENED STUDENTS OF FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS I THINK THAT THERE IS- MORE ATTENTION BEING PAID TO IT I THINK THAT THIS WAS A BIG YOU'D LIKE TWENTY NINETEEN WITH A HUGE SEVEN IS A HUGE NUMBER OF BILLS ON THIS TOPIC SO- I THINK THERE WAS A LOT. MORE ATTENTION PAID AND I THINK THAT AS WE LEARN AS THOSE FOLKS LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND BECOME MORE- INFORMED ESPECIALLY AS WE CLOSE THE DATA GAPS THERE WILL BE MORE. EVIDENCE THAT CAN HELP SUPPORT SOME OF THE POLICY POSITIONS THAT REALLY NEED TO BE MADE. IT HERE THAT- YEAH AND I WAS JUST GOING TO TOUCH POINT OF THIS EVERYTHING PIECE JUST LOOKING AT. THE STUDENT. IS THIS THROUGH THE LENS OF CIVIL RIGHTS IN RELEASING THAT- LIKE I WAS TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF THAT IS. LOT OF THE DISPARITIES BETWEEN BARS A COLLAR AND THEIR WHITE PEERS BUT ALSO WHEN WE LOOK AT SERVICING WE SEE THAT. ARGUE BARS A COLOR ARE YOU ROLLING AND INCOME REPAYMENT. OF THE SAME WEIGHT RATE AS- WHITE FARMERS AND WE KNOW THAT. BARS HAVE MUCH BETTER OUTCOMES WHEN THEY ARE ENROLLED IN- INCOME RETURN PAYMENT PLANS AND SO I WAS REALLY. LOOKING AT SIR RESOURCES SAYING WHY ARE WE HAVING THESE GAPS IF WE KNOW THAT- BARS ARE MUCH. LESS INCLINED TO DEFAULT LATEST TWENTY TIMES LESS INCLINED TO THE BALL WHEN. THEY'RE OLD ID ARBOR WE'RE SEEING THAT- BAR WAS A COLOR NEARLY AS LIKELY TO NOT BE MAKING PAYMENTS AS THEY ARE TO BE INVOLVED IN IT ARE PLANNED SO. REALLY MAKING THAT PUSH TO MAKE ME DO TO BE LOOKING AT SERVICERS AND IN. EXAMINING THEIR PRACTICES IN SAYING WHAT ARE WE HAVING THESE GAPS IS. THIS IS A CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE. CAN'T. WEAR MISSING IN. PLACE TO PROTECT OUR. RIGHT TALKS ABOUT THE FACT THAT. CAN USE A COLOR HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF DAT. DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF DEFAULT AND END UP AS A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE STUDENTS ARE ENROLLED IN THESE FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS. AND WE DID SPEAK TO THE FACT THAT IT IN IT SEEMS THAT THAT HAS BEEN A DELIBERATE TARGETING A MARKETING STRATEGY. I'M ARE THERE AND IT ALSO SEEMS AS IF THERE ARE- HE SAID SOME DISPARITIES IN SERVICING. CAN'T ENTER QUINCY. ARE THERE ANY OTHER THINGS THAT YOU THINK WE NEED TO BE DOING FROM HIM IN EDUCATION- COMMUNICATION PERSPECTIVE TO TRY TO CLOSE SOME OF THOSE GAPS. AT THE STATE LEVEL I THINK THAT. IN ONE IS A TWENTY SIXTEEN BUT DON'T QUOTE ME ON THAT ARE THERE A BIG OFFICE OF STUDENT ASSISTANCE AND RELIEF WAS CREATED AT THE BUREAU FOR PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION THEY HAVE IN THEIR SHORTS TENURE THERE REALLY TRIED TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF OUTREACH THAT THEY ARE DOING THEY ARE TRYING TO ATTEND COLLEGE FAIRS AND- DO. MORE INFORMATION. FOR MORE INFORMATION WITH AT CRITICAL TIMES I THINK THAT THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT I ALSO I'LL I'LL REPEAT MYSELF I THINK THAT AS WE GET MORE DATA IF THAT WILL BE VALUABLE NOT ONLY TO STUDENTS BUT ALSO TO- POLICY MAKERS AS WE AS WE DESIGN PROGRAMS THAT HELP GUIDE STUDENTS AND SMALL GRANTS AND HELPFUL INTO THEIR EDUCATIONS I THINK HAVING DATA ON OUTCOMES AND WHAT REALLY THAT RESULTS OF THAT EDUCATION WILL BE WILL REALLY HELP A LOT I THINK THAT. BECAUSE LOS DATA GINGER GENERAL. WAITING ON THAT BUT I DO THINK THAT IT IS IT IS A HUGE BENEFIT TO BOTH STUDENTS AND POLICY MAKERS- TO REALLY BE ABLE TO ASSESS WHAT THE OUTCOMES OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE AND THEN TO BE ABLE TO MAKE EDUCATED AND INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT THE POLICIES WE WANT TO CREATE AROUND THEM SO THAT THAT IS ONE PIECE FOR ME. I REALLY LOVE IT HE SAID ABOUT THE DATA VIEWS AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY POWERFUL THAT WE ALSO HAVE REALLY BELIEVE THAT THE MORE THAT WE ACTUALLY THE SEED WE CAN SEE THAT THIS REALLY IS A CRISIS EIGHT I KNOW THAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO THAT. THE RACIAL WEALTH GAP IN THIS COUNTRY WE KNOW THAT- WHITE HOUSEHOLDS HAVE THIRTEEN TIMES THAT WEALTH OF BLACK ALSO IT'S IN ABOUT 10% OF LATINO HOUSEHOLDS AND SO WE CAN SEE THAT THERE WAS GAPS WILL CREATE THE ISSUES WHERE WE HAVE BARS OF COLOUR TAKING OUT MORE THAN THAT WE HAVE DATA ON SERVICING OR THEY DON'T COME IN WITH OTHER ISSUES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT WILL DISABLE- THESE ARE DIFFERENT IS. IS YAKKING UP AS- WE KNOW THAT. CALLING FOR. YEAH THESE THINGS WERE STILL SAYING ARE A GAP BETWEEN THE BARS SO JUST REALLY RATING READER REITERATING THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING DATA TO REALLY PINPOINT WHERE THESE PROBLEMS ARE COME BY ALSO I LOVE DATA AS WELL SO AND IF YOU WERE IN A DATA DRIVEN POLICY MAKING I'M BUT I THINK THIS YET TO ME THAT YOU YOU MENTION THE FACT THAT THERE IS YOU KNOW THERE'S A WEALTH AND INCOME DISPARITY THERE THAT IMPLIES THAT A LOT OF THESE VIEWS OF COLOR QUALIFY FOR LOANS QUALIFY FOR PROGRAMS THAT THEY'RE EITHER NOT AWARE RATHER NOT APPLYING FOR. I'M IN ON THE ONE HAND THIS FEELS LIKE A IN A HUGE INTRACTABLE PROBLEM BUT WHEN YOU DO THINK ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY RELATING ON THE TABLE BUT THE NUMBER OF TIMES IT COMES DOWN TO PEOPLE NOT HAVING GOOD INFORMATION I'M FOR PROFIT IN A DECISION TENDS TO BE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BUT MOST PEOPLE ARE MAKING A DECISION ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO FOR COLLEGE AT A POINT IN TIME THAT WE KNOW WHERE IT IS SO IN TERMS OF FOR US AS POLICY MAKERS BE ABLE TO HAVE AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION. IT IS AN EASIER INTERVENTION THAT IN SO MANY OF THE YOU KNOW THE CHALLENGES THAT WE GRAPPLE IT'S HAPPENING AT THE END OF HIGH SCHOOL AND SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO AN EFFECTIVE JOB OF PROVIDING PEOPLE WITH EIGHT EASY TO UNDERSTAND COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION OF YOUR HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO HERE THEY ARE FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND HERE'S THE- PERSON IF. I WEEK BETTER. FOR LEASE AT. FACE I WOULD I WOULD DEFINITELY AGREE ESPECIALLY FOR SORT OF YOUR TRADITIONAL COMING OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT- THE TRICKY PART IS THE- OFFICE. YOUR NONTRADITIONAL STUDENT- IT IS IT IS MORE COMMON THAT YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A RETURNING STUDENT A FIRST TIME COLLEGE STUDENT THAT TOOK A FEW YEARS BETWEEN HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE SINGLE PARENTS- FOSTER THAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE. FOR PROFITS REALLY DO TENDS TO TARGET THE FOLKS THAT HAVE THE LEAST AMOUNT OF SORT OF SUPPORT- UNFORTUNATELY AND SO- AT LEAST THE BAD ACTORS TO AND SO. IT IS THERE LIKE I SAY THERE ARE THERE HAVE BEEN SOME STATS CALIFORNIA IS TRYING TO DO STUFF BUT THE SORRY THE OFFICES STUDENTS. RELIEF I'M REALLY HAS DONE A GOOD JOB OF TRYING TO REACH STUDENTS WHERE THEY ARE THEY'RE ALSO PARTNERING WITH- TRYING TO DO SOME WORK ON MILITARY BASES WHICH IS ANOTHER BIG SEGMENT VETERANS AND ACTIVE MILITARY ARE OFTEN ALSO- ONE OF THOSE TARGETED DEMOGRAPHICS. SO TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO REACH THOSE STUDENTS ESPECIALLY THE NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS WHERE THEY ARE I THINK IS ALSO GOING TO BE REALLY CRITICAL- AND OFTEN TOUGHER BECAUSE AS YOU SAY THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY ALL WRAPPED UP. IN THE HIGH SCHOOL AND SO IT IS. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE PROBABLY COULD BE DOING A BETTER JOB OF WHEN I THINK I READ I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS AN- ACCURATE STATISTIC BUT I READ AN ARTICLE THAT. I'M INNOCENT. THE AVERAGE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS- FOUR YEAR COLLEGE STUDENT SPENDS YEAR MONTHS AN HOUR'S DELAY IN RESEARCHING THAT THE DECISION OF WHERE TO ATTEND A FOR PROFIT COLLEGE OFTENTIMES HAPPENS IN LIKE IT'S LIKE A MINUTE IT'S THE UC ONE AD THEY SAY THE RIGHT THING YOU GET THAT ONE PHONE CALL. AND PEOPLE ARE NOT- YOU KNOW THERE'S NOT A LOT OF COMPARES PAYING SEVENTY THINK THERE'S SOMETHING THAT YET AGAIN THERE'S WAYS FOR US TO HELP PEOPLE COMPARISON SHOP I THINK AND INCREASED WHAT DO YOU THINK- BECAUSE I AM HOPEFUL THAT AND THE ROLL OUT AS OUR AG CALIFORNIA'S FREE UNIVERSAL COMMUNITY CALL IN AN ONLINE COLLEGE PROGRAM WHICH IS TARGETING THIS FOR THESE NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS WILL HELP TO SORT OF YOU KNOW FILL THAT SENSE OF UNMET NEEDS. AND HOPEFULLY BUT- THE FIRST PLACE PEOPLE GO UNDER ARE YOU HOPEFUL ABOUT THAT AS A STEP FORWARD YEAH I THINK I THINK THAT THAT IS I'M I'M HOPEFUL FOR ANY OPPORTUNITIES TO TRY TO GET STUDENTS TO HAVE. ANOTHER SET OF. YOU SAID RECRUITMENT IS A IS A BIG PIECE OF FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS AND SO IT IS OFTEN THAT THEY GOT THEIR NAME THROUGH A DATABASE OR THEY DID A GOOGLE SEARCH AND PUT AN EMAIL ADDRESS AND THEN THEY THEY WILL CALL YOU THEY WILL RECRUIT YOU. AND SO I THINK THAT ANY OPPORTUNITY THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE ANOTHER ONE STOP LOCATION SOMEWHERE WHERE FOLKS KNOW TO GO AND IF IT AT I THINK THAT EVEN THE ALL MY COMMUNITY COLLEGE. IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR STUDENTS TO CONSIDER THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE IT IS JUST IT'S ANOTHER PLACE TO DRAW FOLKS INTO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THE ENSURE ELITE I DO THINK THAT THAT IS IT'S A IT IS A VALUABLE TOOL IN TRYING TO RE DIRECT FOLKS TO. THE PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. OKAY WELL AGAIN THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU IN THE NEXT SESSION TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE. THAT WE GET THESE BILLS THERE NEXT YEAR. AND THEN UP WITH THAT WE WILL GO AHEAD AND OPEN IT UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT IF THERE'S ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK WITH AHEAD AND FORMALIZED BEHIND. THAT MICROPHONE OVER THERE.

THANK YOU. THANK YOU. HELLO GOOD. FOR AFTERNOON- MY NAME IS A LESSON I'M A RECENT GRADUATE FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS AND I'M HERE TO PROVIDE A VERY PERSONAL REASON AS TO WHY IT'S CRUCIAL TO ESTABLISH. CONSUMER PROTECTION STANDARDS FOR- STUDENT BORROWERS WHEN I ORIGINALLY APPLIED FOR MY STUDENT LOANS I WAS TOLD BY MY LOAN SERVICE PROVIDER I WOULD HAVE TO MAKE MY FIRST PAYMENT ON MY LOANS UNTIL SIX MONTHS AFTER GRADUATION. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN NOVEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. AND I OUR POSITION AS A CALIFORNIA SENATE FELLOW THAT'S ONE OF THIS COUNTRY'S MOST PRESTIGIOUS UP PROGRAMS FOR THOSE ENGAGING IN PUBLIC SERVICE AND THE POLICY MAKING PROCESS. IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE CAPITOL BUILDING. THROUGHOUT THE YEAR I WAS OFFERED A YEAR LONG DEFERMENT WOULD HAVE PROLONGED MY FIRST PAYMENT TO BE DUE IN SEPTEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN. HOWEVER IN SEPTEMBER I RECEIVE THIS ENVELOPE. WITH EIGHT DIFFERENT LETTERS INFORMING ME OF A LATE FEE THAT HAS BEEN CHARGED TO MY ACCOUNT. OF THE SERVICE AREA HAS LED ME TO ALLOWING NOW HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS IN LATE FEES. UP THAT'S FAIR TO BE AND AS A PASSED. OLD A BLUE GOLD OPPORTUNITY. RISK WHICH SURE IS I NEVER TO PAY UP WISHIN I. GET ITS FAIR I CAN AFFORD THAT AS A D. HONOREE I CANNOT AFFORD. AS SOMEONE WHO CAN BARELY A FOR BREAK EVERY MORNING CANNOT AFFORD THAT. AS A LOW INCOME FIRST YEAR IN COLLEGE. I'M IN OF COLOR AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN I CANNOT AFFORD THESE JUST A DOLLARS IN LATE FEES PASSING THIS BILL IS NOT ONLY VITAL FOR MY WELL BEING IT'S ALSO VITAL AND CRUCIAL FOR THE EMOTIONAL. PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL BEING OF OVER FOUR MILLION STUDENT BARS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I FEAR I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE PROMISE OF A PROSPEROUS LIFE THAT HIGHER EDUCATION HAS TO OFFER WITHOUT THE SUPPORT IN ADVOCACY OF AB THREE SEVENTY SIX. THIS SITUATION IS UNFAIR HOWEVER THE GROUPS WORKING TO AT LEVY EIGHT THE SITUATION IN ALL I ASK IS THAT. THOSE PEOPLE COME TO THE TABLE AND ALLOW US TO DISCUSS ENVELOPES LIKE THESE IN OPPORTUNITIES TO HAVE THE LIFE THAT OUR PARENTS ARE COMMUNITIES HAVE SACRIFICED SO MUCH FOR US TO GET THERE THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR STORY I AGREE THAT IS COMPLETELY UNFAIR AND I HOPE THAT THERE ARE SOME FOLKS HERE TODAY THAT CAN HELP YOU. ENSURE THAT WE ADDRESS THAT SPECIFIC ISSUE AND LIKE YOU SAID IT'S YOU KNOW IT IS ABOUT YOUR PERSONAL STORY IT'S ALSO ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE. WHO'S IN THAT SITUATION THAT WE ARE PASS WE PASS AB THREE SEVENTY SIX SO WE ENSURE THIS DOES NOT KEEP HAPPENING TO PEOPLE. TO THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT WAS AMAZING I DON'T REALLY WANT TO FOLLOW YOU BUT I WILL ANYWAY. SUZANNE MARTIN TELL US IN YOUR POLICY COUNCIL CONSUMER REPORTS- PROUD CO SPONSOR OF AB THREE SEVEN SIX WORKING WITH A LOT OF WONDERFUL PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM. HOW TO TRY TO. CLEAN UP THE MESS THAT POLICYMAKERS AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL ON A HAVE FORCED UPON ALL OF US AND ALSO STUDENT BAR MYSELF AND EVEN AS A LAWYER. WHO WORKS ON THE STUFF FOR A LIVING I'VE HAD LOAN SERVICERS ME OVER TO. AND THAT TELLS YOU ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW. RIGHT SO. YOU WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT LIKE DATA AND COUNSEL IT INFORMATION ALL THAT IS WONDERFUL IT'S NECESSARY BUT IT IS INSUFFICIENT. TO FIX THE PROBLEM BECAUSE THE PROBLEM IS WE HAVE PUT THE BURDEN OF NAVIGATING THIS MORASS. INDIVIDUAL THEIR FAMILIES. AND THEIR PRIVATE COME. THE PROFIT OFF OF THAT CONFUSION. THEY ARE PROFITING. SO BIG LOAN SERVICERS AND DEBT COLLECTORS AND ALL OTHER MANNER PRIVATE AFTER DEBT RELIEF COMPANIES BECAUSE FOR THEM IN THERE TOO. ARE THERE THEY'RE OPERATING WITH RELATIVE IMPUNITY BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE. THE KINDS OF CLEAR ENFORCEABLE CONSUMER PROTECTION. THE PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE SHOULD THEY BE PUT MISTER BLASIER MORE IN ORDER TO GET EDUCATION THEY HAVE TO CALL WILL DO SO WE PROTECT PEOPLE WITH MORTGAGES. PEOPLE WITH CREDIT CARDS WE'RE NOT THE SAME THING FOR STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS. AND SOMEONE ADVOCATE AND A POWER MYSELF IT MAKES ME ANGRY. IT MAKES ME. ANGRY BECAUSE STUDENTS. WONDERFUL STUDENTS LIKE YOU. CORD SO. YOU DON'T. KNOW WHAT DESERVES THAT. SO OUR COLOR. NO HOLD THE COME. IS A PROP. FEDERAL LOAN PROGRAM. WOULD MAKE THEM ACCOUNTABLE TO HAVE TO PROVIDE COMPETENT. WELL TRAINED STAFF TO HAVE. ACCURATE ACTIONABLE INFORMATION IT WOULD BAN THEM FROM TAKING ON REASONABLE ADVANTAGE OF YOUR CONFUSION OVER YOUR LOANS AND- ABUSIVE PRACTICES. AND IF THEY VIOLATED ANY THOSE PROVISIONS WE COULD TAKE THEM TO COURT. SO THAT BILLS HELD UP AND SENATE APPROPRIATIONS RIGHT NOW THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS SHARE. HIS DISTRICTS- SO IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED IN GETTING INVOLVED IN THIS BILL WITH OUR CAR PARTNERS IN ACTION WITH THE WEEK OF ACTION THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS WILL GET TO THE FINISH LINE BECAUSE STUDENT BORROWERS CAN'T WAIT. THANK YOU THANK YOU YES. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY WOMAN FOR BEING HERE TODAY- MY NAME'S CODY NANNY AND I'M THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR AT STUDENT DEBT CRISIS WE REPRESENT ABOUT A MILLION SUPPORTERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY IMPACTED BY STUDENT DEBT- AND I FIRST IS WANTING KNOWLEDGE ONLY FOR START WORKING ON THIS ISSUE GETTING A ROOM TOGETHER THIS BIG TO TALK ABOUT THIS ISSUE WAS IMPOSSIBLE I'M SO THIS IS A BIG WIN JUST TO BE HERE TALKING ABOUT TO USE IT THANKS VERY MUCH- I HEAR EVERY DAY FROM DOZENS OF. TO SHARE THEIR STORIES WITH US. WHO HAVE SIMILAR. AND HAVE HAD THEIR LIVES TURNED UPSIDE DOWN. BY STUDENT LOAN DEBT- THERE'S NOT ENOUGH PUBLIC COMMENT IN THE WORLD TO GET THROUGH THEM SO I'LL SHARE MY PERSONAL STORY WITH YOU- AS ONE OF THE FORTY FIVE MILLION PEOPLE STUDENT AT- I HAVE STUDENT LOANS. I HAVE A TWIN BROTHER WHO ALSO HAS STUDENT LOANS. AND IT TOOK MY PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS TO CO SIGN STUDENT LOANS TO PAY FOR EDUCATION- MY MOTHER WAS PERMANENTLY TOTALLY APPARENTLY DISABLED AND WAS NEVER TOLD. THAT STUDENT LOAN. THIS WAS AN OPTION FOR HER. MY TWIN BROTHER A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER HERE IN THIS DISTRICT NEWS NEVER TOLD THAT STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS IS AN OPTION FOR HIM BECAUSE HE'S A PUBLIC SERVICE WORKER- I'VE HAD. A THOUSANDS AN EXTRA COST BECAUSE OF MISS COMMUNICATIONS. BETWEEN ME AND MY STUDENT LOAN SERVICER. SO IN MY OWN FAMILY ALONE. ALL OF US HAVE BEEN. BY US TO KNOWN INDUSTRY RUN AMOK AND THAT'S WHY THE DEBT CRISIS. I PERSONALLY- ARE STRONG SUPPORTERS IN CO SPONSORS STUDENT. BILL OVER. AND SO ANYONE ENGAGED WITH. MARCUS SPONSORS AS WELL AS NEXT IN POLICY- THE SB PC CONSUMER REPORTS- BUT I THINK THIS LEGISLATION IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT- FOR NOW- ADVOCATES LIKE US WILL CONTINUE TO HOST WORKSHOPS LIKE WE'RE GONNA DO HERE TODAY- BUT IT IS NOT ENOUGH THESE ARE SYSTEMIC ISSUES. THAT START WITH THE STUDENT LOAN SERVICING COMPANIES- AND WORK THEIR WAY DOWN SO PLEASE CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME IS THE STOMACH ON JOB I'M A FIRST YEAR PHYSIOLOGICAL SCIENCE STUDENT AT UCLA AND A VOLUNTEER- INTERN WITH CALPERS STUDENTS FROM LOS ANGELES CALIFORNIA- FOR MANY OF US. PURSUING ANY SORT OF HIGHER EDUCATION IS IN ITSELF A RISK. WE TAKE ON THIS DEBT AND WE HOPE THAT WILL GIVE US A CHANCE FOR A BETTER FUTURE WE- JUST HOPE. I WANT TO PURSUE A CAREER IN MEDICINE BUT THERE ISN'T A DAY THAT GOES BY THAT I DON'T WORRY ABOUT HOW MUCH I'M BURDENING MY PARENTS AND MYSELF. WITH JUST THE COST OF MY UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES ALONE. AFTER THAT'LL HAVE TO TAKE OUT EVEN MORE TO PAY FROM HEAD SCHOOL DEBTS THAT EVEN ON A PHYSICIAN'S PAYROLL WILL TAKE DECADES OR EVEN MY ENTIRE LIFETIME TO PAY ALL. COMPOUNDING THAT STRESSES THE REALITY THAT DIFFERENT LOAN SERVICERS TREAT THEIR BORROWERS VERY DIFFERENTLY. AND THAT. THAT MIGHT MEAN PAYING MORE OVER THE LIFETIME OF MY LOAN JUST BECAUSE OF WHAT SERVICE ARE I WAS ASSIGNED TO. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIANS AND I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU THIS BUT CALIFORNIANS OVER A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS A HUNDRED. IN DOLLARS IN IN JUST STUDENT LOAN DEBT AND- MOST OF US ARE JUST REGULAR PEOPLE WERE NOT FINANCIAL EXPERTS WERE NOT LAWYERS. WE NEED STRICTER PROTECTIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TREATED FAIRLY AND WITH DIGNITY AND NOT. HELD HOSTAGE BY THE POWERFUL FINANCIAL INDUSTRY SO I URGE YOU TO PASS THE STUDENT BORROWERS THE BILL OF RIGHTS AND TO ENCOURAGE ALL OF OUR STATE SENATORS TO. TO VOTE YES ON THE BILL THIS SEASON.

AND THIS NUMBER IS GONNA AND ACTUALLY GROW EVERY SINGLE YEAR FOR ALL THESE PEOPLE. THEIR DEGREE IS GONNA PERHAPS TURN FROM LIKE A OF OPPORTUNITY INTO YOU KNOW. A CRUSHING DEATH SENTENCE. AND TO PROTECT STUDENT BORROWERS ARE WORDS I HOPE YOU URGE ALL OF OUR STATE SENATORS TO SPUR STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS BILL OF RIGHTS- SO WE CAN. PURSUE OUR EDUCATION LITTLE YOU KNOW OUR WORRY FREE. THANK YOU. FOR. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS KRISTEN MCGUIRE I'M THE OWNER I'M DOING THE SAME THING WESTERN REGION DIRECTOR FOR YOUNG INVINCIBLE- AND NATIONAL POLICY AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. I'M AS YOU HEARD TODAY AS THE WAY THAT STUDENT LOANS ARE BEING SERVICED IS NOT ONLY- A FINANCIAL ISSUE WITH THE SOCIAL JUSTICE ISSUE- WHERE WE FIND LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND BLACK FAMILIES AND LATINO FAMILIES. OF BEING DISPROPORTIONATELY- SERVICED AND EFFECTIVELY- PERSONALLY- OR WILL YOUNG MISSILES IS ALSO A CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. BUT FOR VERY PERSONAL REASON- I TOO WAS A FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENT. FUNNY STORY I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT- MY SINGLE MOTHER I DON'T KNOW OUR FAMILY WAS LOW INCOME AND SO I DID ARE FASTER AND MY ESE WITH ZERO. AND I SAID MOM I THINK REPORT. IS THE LIKE I'VE BEEN TRYING TO TELL YOU THAT- THAT THAT THE TRUE STORY LIKE I CAN PICTURE BEING IN OUR DINING ROOM TABLE- BACK WHEN PASSES WERE PAPER- BUT ANYWAY- SO BECAUSE OF THAT- I TOOK OUT. LOANS TO HELP FINANCE MY CAREER AT CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY- FOUR AND A HALF YEARS LATER I LEFT COLLEGE GOING TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS- WHICH WASN'T TOO BAD RIGHT IT'S UNDER THE AVERAGE EVERYTHING'S FINE. BUT BECAUSE I WASN'T EDUCATED- PROPERLY BY MY SERVICE THERE I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ALL OF THE RULES I DIDN'T KNOW- THAT WORKING FOR NONPROFIT APPLY DIFFERENT BENEFITS TO ME. I'M I'M ALL FORTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS AND I HAVE BEEN OUT OF COLLEGE FOR FIFTEEN YEARS. AND I HAVE BEEN IN REPAYMENT IT IS THE TYPES OF ISSUES WHEN WE'RE SAYING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND FOR GENERATION FAMILIES. A WHEN THE SERVICES DON'T GIVE YOU THE INFORMATION THAT YOU NEED PROPERLY PAY OFF. ON A YOU CAN'T DO IT IT'S NOT THAT WE DON'T WANT TO READ WE ARE DEBT IT'S THAT WE'RE TRYING TO REPAIR THAT DON'T HAVE THE SKILLS AND THE RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO DO SO EFFECTIVELY. I'M A LUCKY IN MY LATE I WAS ABLE TO EDUCATE MY BROTHERS I WAS ABLE TO EDUCATE COUSINS BEYOND BEING BEHIND ME AND THEN MY CHILDREN WILL HAVE THE SAME ISSUES. BUT AGAIN LIKE SUZANNE SAID IT SHOULD BE LEFT UP TO THE INDIVIDUAL TO FIGURE THESE THINGS OUT PASSED THIS IN INFORMATION DOWN AND I DON'T BELIEVE THROUGH THROUGH. LATE TO HELP OURSELVES OUT POP. I'M INSTEAD THAT'S WHY BILLS I AB THREE SEVENTY SIX NEEDS CONSERVE THROUGH. AND BE PASSED. OR DO YOU WANT BE HALF OF YOUR INSTABLE AT YOUR COLLEAGUES. IN THE. THIS OPPORTUNITY CRESCENT. I MY NAME IS RIGHT BUT I LIST AND I AM A UCLA I ATTEND UCLA I'M DOING MY MASTERS IN SOCIAL WELFARE AND PUBLIC POLICY IT'LL MASTERS- AND- ACTUALLY I'M HERE TO SHARE TWO THINGS. I AM ALSO A FINANCIAL COACH AND IN MY EXPERIENCE WITH WORKING WITH INDIVIDUALS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY- I. HAVE WITNESSED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH PARTICULARLY THERE HAS BEEN- A AT A VERY MUCH A NEED IN ADDRESSING THE POPULATION WITH MENTAL ILLNESS- AND BEING TARGETS FOR THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY INCOME. I'M SO ONE OF MY PATIENTS WILL I WAS WORKING WITH SHE YES I SHE ENROLLED IN YOU YEAH I AND THEY PRACTICALLY TOLD HER HEY. YES YOU CAN PAY FOR COLLEGE WILL GO AHEAD TAKE OUT LOANS AND WILL ALSO YOU CAN. IT CAN BE SOMETHING I THROUGH CAN PAY FOR THREE YEARS SO. I'M IT WAS JUST AS EASY AS THAT SIX SIGNATURE AND- THERE SHE WAS ENROLLED NOW TODAY I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE IS DOING WITH THOSE STUDENT LOANS. IF SHE HAS COMPLETED THE PROGRAM I WAS ONLY AN INTERN AT THE TIME. AND I COULD NOT DO MORE THAN TO JUST ADVISER. SO THAT WAS THAT IS A VERY PARTICULAR- NEED AND PERHAPS A GAP IN THINGS THAT WERE NOT CONSIDERING. I'M ANOTHER THING AS ALSO A STUDENT BORROWER GOING FROM SAN DIEGO STATE TO NOW YOU SEE LATE. I ACTUALLY WHEN I WAS MAKING THE PAYMENTS FOR MY LOANS MY- SERVICER DID NOT WITH GREAT LAKES DID NOT EVEN KNOW HOW TO CALCULATE MY INTEREST RATE- SO. IT WHEN I WAS ASKING THEM ABOUT HOW TO GO ABOUT MAKING THOSE PAYMENTS OBVIOUSLY I ALREADY KNEW THAT I NEEDED TO MAKE THE PAYMENTS TOWARDS THE HIGHEST INTEREST RATE BUT- THEY DID NOT KNOW HOW TO CALCULATE DATED EIGHT. TRYS HOW WOULD HOW WOULD I ACCUMULATED WHAT WOULD BE MY OUTCOME IN TWO OR THREE YEARS. SO THAT WAS A HUGE. THAT IT DISAPPOINTMENT I DID NOT EXPECT THAT AT ALL BUT- I WOULDN'T BE THE ONLY ONE. I'M IS SO TODAY I AM HERE ALSO I AM WORKING WITH CONSUMER REPORTS WAS IS AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY- THEY ARE ALSO. A REACHING OUT BECAUSE WE'RE WORKING HER MASTERS IN PUBLIC POLICY DOING ON OUR THESIS AND- ADVOCATING TOWARDS THE BILL OF RIGHTS- FIRST BILL PARK RIGHT. A ONE INTERVIEW FOLKS TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCES ASKING BARBERS- WE REALLY. ARE UP IN THE DATA COLLECTION SO THAT THEY CAN FOR THESE STORIES AND PUSH FOR THIS BILL. OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH. ZERO THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO JOINED US TODAY ACTUALLY TO OUR EXCELLENT PANELISTS ARE BOTH FOR BEING HERE AND FOR ALL THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING ON THIS. REALLY CRITICAL ISSUE I THINK. FOR ME I COME OVER WITH A COUPLE OF TAKE WAYS I'M SO. NUMBER ONE WE CLEARLY NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE AT DOING MORE TO PROTECT OUR STUDENTS ARE WORSE AND I THINK THAT STARTS. WITH MORE EFFECTIVE CONSUMER PROTECTION ODD. ODD LEGISLATION AND OVERSIGHT WE TALKED QUITE A BIT ABOUT EIGHTY THREE SEVENTY SIX IS BEING. A REALLY CRITICAL FIRST STEP IN THAT JOURNEY- AND IT CERTAINLY ONE I WILL BE ADVOCATING. FOR NEXT SESSION ALONGSIDE SO MANY OF YOU I'M- I THINK THE SECOND THING THAT I TAKE AWAY FROM THIS REALLY IS JUST- THE POINT WE MADE IN THE FIRST PANEL THAT WE ARE LEADING A LOT OF MONEY. ON THE TABLE AND I THINK THAT THERE IS. A LOT THAT WE CAN DO IS CALIFORNIA TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE HELPING OUR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. GET EVERY FEDERAL DOLLAR THAT'S AVAILABLE AND THAT WE PUT THAT PUT THAT TO USE. I'M AND THEN THIRD FOR ME IS THE NEED TO- CAN. A CONVERSATION ON CAL GRANT TO EXPAND AND- I'M- AS WE TALK ABOUT IN THE- TUNNEL. I THE YOU GROWTH AS THE CAL GRANT- AS- CERTAINLY NOT KEPT UP WITH THE PACE OF INFLATION AND A PIECE OF COST OF LIVING HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE HAVE GOT TO ADDRESS THAT SO THAT WE ENSURE THAT. OUR STUDENTS WHO ARE HERE TO. LEARN TAKE A DEGREE. TO START THEIR CAREER. ULTIMATELY ACHIEVE THAT DREAM UP. IN A BETTER LIGHT. CAN DO THAT ARE. NOT WORRY ABOUT WHERE THEY SLEEP OUR HOUSE GOING HOW THEY'RE GOING TO EAT I'M FOR THE MONTH. USERS MIGHT BE TAKE WAYS AND I THINK THE OTHER TECH WAY FOR ME REALLY IS THAT. I'M THERE'S A POWERFUL GROUP OF ADVOCATES ASSEMBLED RIGHT HERE IN THIS ROOM FROM SO MANY DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS AND- FROM SO MANY DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONS AND I THINK LEX. AND SOMEONE MADE THE POINT THAT SEVERAL YEARS AGO. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. STUDENTS COULDN'T GET. REPLACE THIS TICKET. I THINK THAT YOU HAVE DONE SO MUCH TO. ELEVATE THIS CONVERSATION TO MAKE CLEAR THAT. THIS IS A CRISIS IT'S NOT JUST IMPACTING THE- THE MILLIONS OF STUDENT BORROWERS HEARING CALIFORNIA. IT HAS RIPPLE EFFECTS ALL ACROSS THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY AND WE NEED TO URGENTLY ADDRESS IT SAID THAT WE- ENSURE THAT. OUR STUDENTS ARE WORRIES ARE ABLE TO. BUY HOMES THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO START A FAMILY THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO INVEST. IN THEIR FUTURES AND THAT WERE ABLE TO START TO CLOSE SOME THE GENERATIONAL GAPS. THAT WE TALKED ABOUT I AM IN ONE OF OUR PANELS- BUT I HAVE TO SAY I'M VERY ENCOURAGED BY THE GROUP OF FOLKS THAT ARE HERE AND- I'M I THINK THEY IT. AT YOUR ADVOCACY IS GOING TO ENSURE THAT WERE ABLE TO TAKE SOME REALLY. CONCRETE AND MEANINGFUL STEPS IN ON NEXT YEAR'S LEGISLATIVE SESSION SO. THANK YOU FOR THAT ON THIS CONVERSATION WILL CERTAINLY INFORM OUR LEGISLATIVE ACTION AS WE MOVE FORWARD. IT IS CERTAINLY THE BEGINNING OF A CONVERSATION AND NOT THE AND- BUT THAT LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THANKS SO MUCH
