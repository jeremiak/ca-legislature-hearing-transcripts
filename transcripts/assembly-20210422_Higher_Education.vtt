00:28:55.533 --> 00:28:59.003
IS TO HAVE A SYSTEM IN PLACE IN

00:29:07.812 --> 00:29:10.315
THEY'RE EIGHTEEN. THE FIVE

00:29:10.381 --> 00:29:11.749
TWENTY NINE ACCOUNT WILL GROW

00:29:11.816 --> 00:29:13.952

00:29:35.807 --> 00:29:37.909
BECOMING ALL THE MORE DIFFICULT

00:29:37.976 --> 00:29:40.311

00:42:34.418 --> 00:42:35.719
MAKING SURE THAT EVERY CHILD IN

00:42:35.786 --> 00:42:37.855
CALIFORNIA KNOWS THAT THERE'S-

00:42:37.922 --> 00:42:40.958
SOMETHING THERE FOR THEM- WHEN

00:42:41.025 --> 00:42:42.026
IT'S TIME FOR THEM TO GO TO

00:42:42.092 --> 00:42:44.461
COLLEGE. IS IT'S AN ADMIRABLE

00:42:44.528 --> 00:42:47.965
GOAL- WE NEED TO DO THIS AT THE

00:42:48.032 --> 00:42:48.799
BACK THE COST OF COLLEGE IS

00:42:48.866 --> 00:42:53.270
SKYROCKETING SO I FULLY SUPPORT

00:42:53.337 --> 00:42:56.407
THAT- THAT GOAL THAT YOU HAVE

00:42:56.473 --> 00:42:57.408
AND THEN WE NEED TO CONTINUE

00:42:57.474 --> 00:42:59.610
WORKING ON. HOW TO FIGURE OUT

00:42:59.677 --> 00:43:02.446
HOW TO DO THAT IT ALSO RAISES.

00:43:02.513 --> 00:43:03.847
IN THE WAY THAT YOU WANT TO

00:43:03.914 --> 00:43:05.416
FUND THIS WHICH I THINK HAS HAS

00:43:05.482 --> 00:43:07.851
MANY PROBLEMS- IN THAT WE'VE

00:43:07.918 --> 00:43:09.787
DISCUSSED THIS I THINK A LOT OF

00:43:09.853 --> 00:43:10.587
A LOT OF US RECORD RECOGNIZE

00:43:10.654 --> 00:43:13.724
THAT. ALSO ALERTS US AND

00:43:13.791 --> 00:43:16.593
REMINDS US ABOUT HOW WE FINANCE

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:17.528
HIGHER EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA

00:43:17.594 --> 00:43:20.297
SO. PEOPLE SOME PEOPLE ARE

00:43:20.364 --> 00:43:23.067
EXPECTED TO PASTE. SOME OR ALL

00:43:23.133 --> 00:43:25.102
OF THE COSTS OTHERS ARE GIVEN

00:43:25.169 --> 00:43:27.604
GRANTS OR SCHOLARSHIPS. AND

00:43:27.671 --> 00:43:29.340
DIED IN THEIR LIVING EXPENSES

00:43:29.406 --> 00:43:31.108
WHICH ARE VERY EXPENSIVE AS

00:43:31.175 --> 00:43:32.810
WELL WE KNOW THAT CERTAINLY IS

00:43:32.876 --> 00:43:33.510
THE CASE FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:43:33.577 --> 00:43:37.081
STUDENTS BUT- FOR FINANCE-

00:43:37.147 --> 00:43:40.184
HIGHER READ. ALSO WITH PRIVATE

00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:43.921
BANKING DOLLARS REALLY- THAT

00:43:43.988 --> 00:43:46.056
THAT. MANY STUDENTS END UP-

00:43:46.123 --> 00:43:47.691
WITH THAT DATA SO THERE'S THE

00:43:47.758 --> 00:43:50.027
STATE RELATED AID THERE IS THE-

00:43:50.094 --> 00:43:51.895
PHILANTHROPIC AID THAT OUR

00:43:51.962 --> 00:43:55.032
UNIVERSITIES ARE NOW SEEKING.-AND THEN THERE IS THE BANKING

00:43:55.099 --> 00:43:57.801
MONEY- THAT- ISSUES ALSO RELY

00:43:57.868 --> 00:44:03.107
ON THE FUN- THAT THAT WHOLE

00:44:03.173 --> 00:44:05.075
HIGHER EDUCATION JOURNEY. E IF

00:44:05.142 --> 00:44:07.578
WE AD MORE STATE SUPPORT FOR

00:44:07.644 --> 00:44:08.545
WE WOULDN'T WE WOULDN'T NEED

00:44:08.612 --> 00:44:11.415
THEM TO DO SO HAVE ANY SAVINGS

00:44:11.482 --> 00:44:12.649
ACCOUNTS OR INVESTMENT

00:44:12.716 --> 00:44:16.820
ACCOUNTS- IS ONE WAY TO DO THAT

00:44:16.887 --> 00:44:18.389
BUT HOW WE FUNDED IS REALLY

00:44:18.455 --> 00:44:21.025
TRICKY AND THERE'S GOTTA BE A

00:44:21.091 --> 00:44:23.394
WAY FOR PERHAPS NOT JUST THE

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:24.328
STATE OF CALIFORNIA OFFLOAD

00:44:24.395 --> 00:44:26.764
THIS BOTH TO PRIVATE LENDERS

00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:27.698
AND THEN TO STUDENTS TO PAY

00:44:27.765 --> 00:44:30.300
THAT BACK- BUT TO FIGURE OUT A

00:44:30.367 --> 00:44:31.402
DIFFERENT WAY I MEAN PEOPLE

00:44:31.468 --> 00:44:33.704
TALK ABOUT STATE BANKS THINGS

00:44:33.771 --> 00:44:36.006
LIKE THAT BUT HOW ELSE CAN THE

00:44:36.073 --> 00:44:39.043
STATE FUND FUTURE. COSTS OF

00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:42.312
HIGHER EDUCATION THAN THE WAY

00:44:42.379 --> 00:44:44.715
THAT WE'RE DOING IT- SO YOU

00:44:44.782 --> 00:44:45.783
KNOW CONTINUE ON THIS JOURNEY

00:44:45.849 --> 00:44:47.084
WITH THIS BILL TRY TO FIGURE

00:44:47.151 --> 00:44:50.687
OUT A WAY TO FIND THIS FOR.

00:44:50.754 --> 00:44:53.857
FUTURE STUDENTS- BUT I YOU KNOW

00:44:53.924 --> 00:44:54.458
I THINK THAT A LOT OF US HAVE

00:44:54.525 --> 00:44:56.794
CONCERNS THAT THERE'S NO WAY.

00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:58.629
WE COULD ASK FOR A TAX ON BEING

00:44:58.695 --> 00:44:59.930

00:44:59.997 --> 00:45:03.700

THROUGH COLLEGE SO- A LOT OF

00:45:07.071 --> 00:45:07.838
WORK TO DO BUT THIS IS THE

00:45:07.905 --> 00:45:09.973
FIRST STOP. ON THE LEGISLATIVE

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:11.708

OPPORTUNITY MAYBE TO ENHANCE

00:48:46.123 --> 00:48:47.924
THEIR CAREER. AND SO THIS. BILL

00:48:47.991 --> 00:48:50.160
WAS AIMING. TO CREATE AN

00:48:50.227 --> 00:48:52.562
ENVIRONMENT WHERE IT PUTS THE

00:48:52.629 --> 00:48:54.698
SEED MONEY FOR IT TO GROW. IT

00:48:54.765 --> 00:48:57.467
ALSO ENCOURAGES PARENTS TO

00:48:57.534 --> 00:48:59.603
PARTICIPATE IN THE FIVE TWENTY

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:00.170
NINE PLAN BECAUSE LET'S BE

00:49:00.237 --> 00:49:04.007
CLEAR HERE. THOSE OF US WHO-

00:49:04.074 --> 00:49:05.409
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE

00:49:05.475 --> 00:49:07.511
THAT. MODICUM OF AN INVESTMENT

00:49:07.577 --> 00:49:08.979
FOR OUR CHILDREN'S FUTURE CAN

00:49:09.046 --> 00:49:11.048
DO SO BUT THAT'S SPEAKING TO

00:49:11.114 --> 00:49:13.717
LESS THAN ABOUT ROUGHLY 4% OF

00:49:13.784 --> 00:49:15.752
CALIFORNIANS HELLO CALIFORNIA

00:49:15.819 --> 00:49:17.988
PARENTS. SO IT'S A VERY SMALL

00:49:18.055 --> 00:49:20.490
NUMBER. AND SO IN ORDER TO

00:49:20.557 --> 00:49:21.958
CREATE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE

00:49:22.025 --> 00:49:24.127
KIDS ESPECIALLY IN POORER

00:49:24.194 --> 00:49:26.630
NEIGHBORHOODS TO BE ABLE. TO

00:49:26.697 --> 00:49:28.398
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO COMPETE

00:49:28.465 --> 00:49:30.634
IN THE FUTURE AND ADVANCE THEIR

00:49:30.701 --> 00:49:32.369
CAREERS THROUGH AN EDUCATIONAL

00:49:32.436 --> 00:49:33.904
DEGREE OR ANY TYPE OF A DEGREE

00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:36.006
THAT WILL HELP THEM. HAVE A

00:49:36.073 --> 00:49:38.075
CAREER PATH WE NEED TO FIGURE

00:49:38.141 --> 00:49:40.744
OUT HOW WE MAKE AN IMPORTANT

00:49:40.811 --> 00:49:42.813
INITIAL INVESTMENT FOR THEM SO

00:49:42.879 --> 00:49:44.448
THAT THEN THE PARENTS.

00:49:44.514 --> 00:49:46.049
PHILANTHROPIC ORGANIZATIONS AND

00:49:46.116 --> 00:49:48.652
EVERYBODY ELSE CAN HELP FINANCE

00:49:48.719 --> 00:49:51.288
THE REST OF THE WAY THERE- I

00:49:51.355 --> 00:49:52.923
COMPLETELY AGREE ON THE BANKING

00:49:52.989 --> 00:49:54.424
SIDE OF THE ISSUE OF THE

00:49:54.491 --> 00:49:56.560
CONCERNS I TO HAVE THAT CONCERN

00:49:56.626 --> 00:49:58.328
BECAUSE IN NO WAY WOULD I WANT

00:49:58.395 --> 00:50:02.065
MY BILL. CREATE A FEE THAT

00:50:02.132 --> 00:50:04.501
WOULD THEN BE IMPOSED ON THE

00:50:04.568 --> 00:50:06.470
CURRENT GENERATION OF STUDENTS

00:50:06.536 --> 00:50:08.305
WHO NEED THAT MONEY TO BE ABLE

00:50:08.372 --> 00:50:09.740
TO FINANCE THEIR OWN EDUCATION

00:50:09.806 --> 00:50:11.408
SO. OBVIOUSLY THAT IS NOT THE

00:50:11.475 --> 00:50:14.277
INTENTION IN FACT MOST BANKS IF

00:50:14.344 --> 00:50:16.780
NOT ALL HAVE ALREADY WITHDRAWN

00:50:16.847 --> 00:50:19.449
THEMSELVES FROM- EDUCATIONAL

00:50:19.516 --> 00:50:22.919
LOANS LOAN INDUSTRY- WITH WALL

00:50:22.986 --> 00:50:23.754
WELLS FARGO BEING ONE OF THE

00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:27.524
LAST ONES. THEY SOLD THEIR

00:50:27.591 --> 00:50:30.861
SHARE TO NELNET LAST YEAR- AND

00:50:30.927 --> 00:50:32.229
AS YOU SEE WHAT'S GOING ON IN

00:50:32.295 --> 00:50:33.697
THIS INDUSTRY AT LEAST THE

00:50:33.764 --> 00:50:36.133
BANKING INDUSTRY HAS THE C. R.

00:50:36.199 --> 00:50:38.969
A. THE COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT

00:50:39.035 --> 00:50:43.039
ACT THAT IMPOSES UPON BANKS TO

00:50:43.106 --> 00:50:45.008
ACTUALLY MAKE A REINVESTMENT

00:50:45.075 --> 00:50:46.676
BACK INTO THE POOR COMMUNITIES

00:50:46.743 --> 00:50:48.245
THAT THEY WORK IN SO THE BANKS

00:50:48.311 --> 00:50:51.047
ARE COVERED. THE EDUCATIONAL

00:50:51.114 --> 00:50:54.184
LENDING INDUSTRY DOES NOT HAVE.

00:50:54.251 --> 00:50:57.754
SUCH A GOAL. AND BEING THAT

00:50:57.821 --> 00:51:00.791
ALMOST ALL OF THEM OPERATE

00:51:00.857 --> 00:51:01.291
OUTSIDE OF THE STATE OF

00:51:01.358 --> 00:51:03.927
CALIFORNIA YET REAP THE

BENEFITS OF A LARGE MARKET LIKE

00:51:06.129 --> 00:51:08.899

00:51:19.242 --> 00:51:22.646
SO. THIS WAS A LOFTY WAY OF

00:51:22.712 --> 00:51:24.714
LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN ACHIEVE

00:51:24.781 --> 00:51:27.150
REVENUE AND A LOT OF WORK

00:51:27.217 --> 00:51:29.686

00:51:32.989 --> 00:51:34.958
GENERATE THE REVENUE NECESSARY

00:51:35.025 --> 00:51:36.660
FOR THE FOR THE STATE FOR THESE

00:51:47.571 --> 00:51:49.372

TO BE ABLE TO SEE WHAT WE CAN

00:51:52.776 --> 00:51:54.544

TO THE STUDENTS. AS YOU KNOW

02:18:01.840 --> 02:18:03.008

THOSE STUDENTS SPECIFICALLY AND

02:18:48.386 --> 02:18:50.121
THAT WE NEED TO SHED LIGHT ON

02:18:50.188 --> 02:18:52.323
MAKING SURE THAT WE WORK WITH

02:18:52.390 --> 02:18:53.258

02:18:55.326 --> 02:19:02.100
ACTUALLY HAPPENING. OKAY I- SEE

YEAH. THIS IS- YEAH THEY HAVE

02:19:07.605 --> 02:19:10.075
GOOD TASTE GOOD SIZE SO IT IS

02:19:10.141 --> 02:19:12.977
SYSTEM SOME SCHOOLS- HAVE

02:19:13.044 --> 02:19:16.247

THINK- NTEND TO BUT- PRIVATE

02:19:42.640 --> 02:19:44.609
COLLEGES. WHEN THE STATE

02:19:44.676 --> 02:19:47.879
DOESN'T PROVIDE ANY DIRECT AID

02:19:47.946 --> 02:19:49.981
TO THE SCHOOL EVEN SO SOON SO

02:19:50.048 --> 02:19:52.717
MAY BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR A

02:19:52.784 --> 02:19:57.789

02:20:12.370 --> 02:20:14.205
IS SELECTED INTRUSION INTO THE

02:20:14.272 --> 02:20:17.709
ACADEMIC FREEDOM- WHEN WE DON'T

02:20:17.776 --> 02:20:20.411
PROVIDE THE- ANY DIRECT AID TO

02:20:20.478 --> 02:20:27.619
TWO PRIVATE SCHOOLS. V. DE AS

02:20:27.685 --> 02:20:29.220
AS YOU AS YOU MAY UNDERSTAND-

02:20:29.287 --> 02:20:31.756
TAXES DOWN WITH DAVID DOMINANCE

02:20:31.823 --> 02:20:32.891
THE TAXATION IS PUBLICLY

02:20:32.957 --> 02:20:34.893
SUBSIDIZED AT TAXPAYERS'

02:20:34.959 --> 02:20:35.860
BECAUSE THEY RECEIVE THAT

02:20:35.927 --> 02:20:37.996
BENEFIT THAT THERE'S COMES

02:20:38.062 --> 02:20:39.964

WHEN THE DONOR. GIVE THAT MONEY

02:21:27.512 --> 02:21:28.046
R. AS A PARTY IN DAMAGE TO THE

02:21:28.112 --> 02:21:30.148
INSTITUTION. NOW THERE'S

02:21:30.215 --> 02:21:31.616
ALREADY FEDERAL LAW THAT

02:21:31.683 --> 02:21:35.220
REGULATES HOW. IT WOULD BE

02:21:35.286 --> 02:21:36.554
AGAINST THE LAW FOR AN

02:21:36.621 --> 02:21:37.789

NO OVER THEM TO THE CONTRARY

02:21:59.143 --> 02:22:01.045
IT'S ACTUALLY- TO HELP INSURE

02:22:01.112 --> 02:22:01.479
THAT THERE'S GREATER

02:22:01.546 --> 02:22:05.383
TRANSPARENCY ON DATA PURPOSE AS

02:22:05.450 --> 02:22:05.917
YOU MAY KNOW SOME OF THESE

02:22:05.984 --> 02:22:09.821
INDICTMENTS HAVE GROWN. TO

02:22:09.888 --> 02:22:10.388
FIFTEEN TWENTY EIGHT AND UP

02:22:10.455 --> 02:22:12.090
BILLION DOLLARS- AND THESE

02:22:12.156 --> 02:22:13.358
ENDOWMENTS AND WHEN THEY ANSWER

02:22:13.424 --> 02:22:14.993
THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE

02:22:15.059 --> 02:22:17.428
PURPOSE OF IT IS BEING SPENT

02:22:17.495 --> 02:22:18.997
DIRECTLY TO THAT OF THEIR

02:22:19.063 --> 02:22:20.765
DIRECTIVE PURPOSE IN ADDITION

02:22:20.832 --> 02:22:23.401
AS YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS A

02:22:23.468 --> 02:22:25.069
FINANCIAL TAX BENEFIT FOR THAT

02:22:25.136 --> 02:22:26.404
INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE RIGHT

OFFICE FOR THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS

02:22:28.339 --> 02:22:29.107
BECAUSE WE MADE FOR THEN

02:22:29.173 --> 02:22:30.375
DOWNLOADS I THINK THAT'S

02:22:30.441 --> 02:22:31.476
FUNDAMENTALLY THE QUESTION IS

02:22:31.542 --> 02:22:32.911
WHAT'S ENOUGH FOR A DOWN TO

02:22:32.977 --> 02:22:34.779
GROW TO FIFTY BILLION TWO

02:22:34.846 --> 02:22:36.781
HUNDRED BILLION. IF THAT IT WAS

02:22:36.848 --> 02:22:37.849

WE DON'T HAVE UNINTENDED

02:22:53.665 --> 02:22:55.300
CONSEQUENCES ESPECIALLY FOR

02:22:55.366 --> 02:22:57.302

ENDOWMENTS OR OR DONATIONS-

02:23:01.673 --> 02:23:02.340

02:23:02.407 --> 02:23:03.841
PRECEDENT SO THAT'S DEEPLY

02:23:03.908 --> 02:23:05.877
