MY ISSUE IS I WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:27:29.147 --> 00:27:30.782
THAT THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

00:27:30.849 --> 00:27:32.217

00:27:35.186 --> 00:27:37.389
THAT THE BEST PROGRAMS ARE

CONTINUE TO BE FUNDED AND MORE

00:27:39.324 --> 00:27:41.192
IMPORTANT THAT WE GROW EVEN MORE

00:27:41.259 --> 00:27:44.462
SO -- I GUESS WHEN I ALWAYS

00:27:44.529 --> 00:27:46.197
WOULD SAY THE SECOND PART WHICH

00:27:46.264 --> 00:27:48.900
IS THE ONES THAT NEED SOME HELP.

00:27:48.967 --> 00:27:50.602
THAT WE DO PROVIDE THE FUNDING

00:27:50.668 --> 00:27:52.904
FOR THEM AND THAT WE GET THEM TO

00:27:52.971 --> 00:27:54.839
CAPACITY WHERE THEY CAN GROW.

00:27:54.906 --> 00:27:56.608
BUT MOST PEOPLE GENERALLY JUST

00:27:56.674 --> 00:27:58.977
HERE THE ONES THAT DON'T WORK

00:27:59.044 --> 00:28:00.512
AND WE CAN SHOW THAT THEY'RE NOT

00:28:00.578 --> 00:28:02.447
WORKING AND IT NOT ABLE TO GET

00:28:02.514 --> 00:28:04.549
UP TO CAPACITY.

00:28:04.616 --> 00:28:06.684
WE HAVE A FIDUCIARY

00:28:06.751 --> 00:28:09.287
RESPONSIBILITY TO CUT THOSE

00:28:09.354 --> 00:28:11.056
PROGRAMS AND I'M HOPING THAT WE

00:28:11.122 --> 00:28:13.725
THEN MOVED THOSE RESOURCES

00:28:13.792 --> 00:28:15.527
REMEMBER WHAT I SAID THEM REMOVE

00:28:15.593 --> 00:28:16.861

RESOURCES IN MONEY AND AND STAFF

00:28:19.197 --> 00:28:21.366
OVER TO PROGRAMS THAT ACTUALLY

00:28:21.433 --> 00:28:23.868
WORK. FOR ME THAT IS THE MOST

00:28:23.935 --> 00:28:26.704
IMPORTANT THING THAT WE NEED TO

00:28:26.771 --> 00:28:26.871
DO.

00:28:26.938 --> 00:28:30.675
BECAUSE I WORK FOR CRLA FOR

00:28:44.789 --> 00:28:46.357
PEOPLE WE TREAT BUT WE NEVER

00:28:46.424 --> 00:28:47.826
TALK ABOUT HOW MANY.

00:28:47.892 --> 00:28:49.494
PEOPLE WE HELP THE MOST

00:28:49.561 --> 00:28:51.863

00:30:08.706 --> 00:30:10.508
AND CUT DOWN ON THE EVER

00:30:10.575 --> 00:30:11.809
INCREASING CORRECTIONS BUDGET.

00:30:11.876 --> 00:30:13.978
WITH THIS KNOWLEDGE I REQUESTED

00:30:14.045 --> 00:30:15.480
THE OUGHT THE AUDIT HOPING THAT

00:30:15.547 --> 00:30:16.714
THE INFORMATION WE GOT BACK

00:30:16.781 --> 00:30:18.049
WOULD HIGHLIGHT SUCCESSFUL

00:30:18.116 --> 00:30:18.983
PROGRAM.

00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:20.451
AND ALSO ILLUMINATE WHICH

00:30:20.518 --> 00:30:21.786
PROGRAMS ARE IN NEED OF

00:30:21.853 --> 00:30:24.455
ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. TO IMPROVE

00:30:24.522 --> 00:30:25.590
THEIR SUCCESS RATES.

00:30:25.657 --> 00:30:27.659
WHAT WE GOT BACK WAS PARTLY

00:30:27.725 --> 00:30:29.160
POSITIVE IN THAT WE LEARN

00:30:29.227 --> 00:30:31.462
COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR PROGRAM CBT

00:30:31.529 --> 00:30:33.498
ARE AVAILABLE IN ALL STATE

00:30:33.565 --> 00:30:34.532
PRISONS?

00:30:34.599 --> 00:30:36.668
BUT UNFORTUNATELY MUCH MORE WORK

00:30:36.734 --> 00:30:38.303
MUST BE DONE.

00:30:38.369 --> 00:30:39.938
WE LEARNED A TO SYSTEMS FOR PARK

00:30:40.004 --> 00:30:42.006
PRIORITIZING INMATES FOR

00:30:42.073 --> 00:30:43.408
PROGRAMMING ARE OUTDATED.

00:30:43.474 --> 00:30:44.642
WE LEARNED THAT INMATES ARE NOT

00:30:44.709 --> 00:30:46.044
PRIOR TO RISE FOR PROGRAM

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:48.179
PLACEMENT BY NEED AND THERE IS

00:30:48.246 --> 00:30:49.881
NO SYSTEM IN PLACE TO MAKE.

00:30:49.948 --> 00:30:50.782
THAT.

00:30:50.848 --> 00:30:52.083
MAKE SURE THAT THAT INMATES THAT

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:54.652
INMATES CLOSEST TO RELEASE ARE

00:30:54.719 --> 00:30:55.787
PLACED IN PROGRAM.

00:30:55.853 --> 00:30:57.155
WE LEARNED A PROGRAM'S REALLY

00:30:57.222 --> 00:30:59.857
HAVE PERFORMANCE METRICS TO

00:30:59.924 --> 00:31:00.825
EVALUATE OUTCOMES.

00:31:00.892 --> 00:31:02.126
WE ALSO LEARNED SOME POSITIVE

00:31:02.193 --> 00:31:04.996
THINGS AS WELL LEARN THAT.

00:31:05.063 --> 00:31:07.966
THAT AT ELEVEN AT 11% SUCCESS

00:31:08.032 --> 00:31:10.201
WORK RATE THAT WOULD MEAN TO

00:31:10.268 --> 00:31:11.836
PROGRAMS PAY FOR THEMSELVES.

00:31:11.903 --> 00:31:14.038
LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN.

00:31:14.105 --> 00:31:16.274
IF ONE IN NINE PROGRAM

00:31:16.341 --> 00:31:18.176
PARTICIPANTS.

00:31:18.243 --> 00:31:21.913
DO NOT RETURN TO JAIL OR PRISON.

00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:24.682
WE COULD SAVE THE STATE NEARLY

00:31:24.749 --> 00:31:26.651
THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS.

00:31:26.718 --> 00:31:27.752
WE LEARNED THAT THE CAL.

00:31:27.819 --> 00:31:29.988
P. I. A PROGRAMS THOSE THAT

00:31:30.054 --> 00:31:31.556
TRAIN INMATES AND UNION

00:31:31.623 --> 00:31:33.791
AFFILIATED TRADE PROGRAMS ALSO

00:31:33.858 --> 00:31:35.393
HAVE REMARKABLE SUCCESS.

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:36.828
NOT ONLY DO THESE PROGRAMS LEAD

00:31:36.894 --> 00:31:37.996
TO INMATES ENTERING THE

00:31:38.062 --> 00:31:39.497
WORKFORCE WOULD GOOD PAYING

00:31:39.564 --> 00:31:40.898
UNION JOBS BUT THEY ALSO

00:31:40.965 --> 00:31:44.569
REPORTED A RECIDIVISM RATE.

00:31:44.636 --> 00:31:46.070
OF ONLY 7%.

00:31:46.137 --> 00:31:47.839
IT'S DATA LIKE THIS THAT IS MY

00:31:47.905 --> 00:31:49.807
INTEREST TODAY.

00:31:49.874 --> 00:31:51.109
I THINK WE ABLE TATIAN PROGRAMS

00:31:51.175 --> 00:31:52.710
WERE TOO IMPORTANT FOR US NOT TO

00:31:52.777 --> 00:31:53.845
DO ANYTHING.

00:31:53.911 --> 00:31:55.446
AND NOT TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN

00:31:55.513 --> 00:31:56.814
TO SEE THEM SUCCEED SUCCEED

00:31:56.881 --> 00:31:58.049
FURTHER AS STEWARDS OF THE

00:31:58.116 --> 00:31:59.450
PUBLIC'S MONEY IS IMPERATIVE

00:31:59.517 --> 00:32:01.085
THAT WE MAKE WISE INVESTMENTS IN

00:32:01.152 --> 00:32:02.387
TRACK DATA.

00:32:02.453 --> 00:32:03.488
THIS IS THE SUBJECT OF MY

00:32:03.554 --> 00:32:04.656
INTEREST TODAY.

00:32:04.722 --> 00:32:06.557
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT WORKS SO WE

00:32:06.624 --> 00:32:07.859
CAN DOUBLE DOWN.

00:32:07.925 --> 00:32:09.394
ON IT I WANT TO KNOW WHAT

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:11.129
DOESN'T WORK SO WE CAN ADJUST

00:32:11.195 --> 00:32:12.230
AND FIX IT.

00:32:12.297 --> 00:32:13.464
I WANT TO KNOW WHERE WE NEED

00:32:13.531 --> 00:32:14.899
MORE RESOURCES SO WE CAN

00:32:14.966 --> 00:32:16.067
ADVOCATE FOR THEM.

00:32:16.134 --> 00:32:17.268
AND I WANT TO KNOW WHERE THERE

00:32:17.335 --> 00:32:19.237
IS WAY SO WE CAN MAKE CHANGES

00:32:19.304 --> 00:32:20.672
FOR ME REAL WITH PATIENT

00:32:20.738 --> 00:32:22.373
REHABILITATION IS A MORAL ISSUE

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:24.309
BUT IS ALSO A FINANCIAL ONE AS

00:32:24.375 --> 00:32:25.310
WELL.

00:32:25.376 --> 00:32:26.944
IS THE FACT THAT EVERY INMATE

00:32:27.011 --> 00:32:29.113
COSTS EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:30.415
DOLLARS PER YEAR TO HOUSE IN

00:32:30.481 --> 00:32:32.317
ADDITION EACH PERSON KEPT BEHIND

00:32:32.383 --> 00:32:33.785
BARS ALSO MEANS A LOSS OF

00:32:33.851 --> 00:32:35.119
PROPERTY TAX.

00:32:35.186 --> 00:32:37.689
INCOME TAX AND SALES TAX TO

00:32:37.755 --> 00:32:39.724
SOMETHING OF DISTASTE NOTHING OF

00:32:39.791 --> 00:32:42.694
THE VALUE OF EACH INDIVIDUAL TO

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.195
THE FAMILY COMMUNITY.

00:32:44.262 --> 00:32:45.363
WE CAN QUALIFY QUANTIFY THE

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:46.698
SAVINGS AND CAPTURE THEM THIS IS

00:32:46.764 --> 00:32:48.566
WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT WE CAN

00:32:48.633 --> 00:32:50.234
PROVE THE VALUE REHABILITATION

00:32:50.301 --> 00:32:51.769
PROGRAMS WE CAN LAY THE

00:32:51.836 --> 00:32:54.572
FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE FUNDING.

00:32:54.639 --> 00:32:56.407
WE CAN SUPPORT THE ARE.

00:32:56.474 --> 00:32:58.776
IN CD C. R. BUT WE CAN ALSO DO

00:32:58.843 --> 00:33:01.245
THAT WITH DEPARTMENTAL BY IN TO

00:33:01.312 --> 00:33:02.980
HELP US UNDERSTAND SUCCESS.

00:36:03.361 --> 00:36:04.929
OF THE CORRECTIONAL EXPERIENCE

00:36:04.996 --> 00:36:06.564
AND I ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO

00:36:06.631 --> 00:36:08.032
HEARING FROM THE SECONDARY IN

00:36:08.099 --> 00:36:09.166
BEING INVOLVED OVERALL IN THE

00:36:09.233 --> 00:36:10.301
OVERSIGHT EVERITT AND JUST AS A

00:36:10.368 --> 00:36:11.602
PERSONAL SIDE THE REASON THAT I

00:36:11.669 --> 00:36:13.104
GOT INVOLVED IN THIS ISSUE.

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:14.539
IS THAT I LOS AN OFFICER IN MY

00:36:14.605 --> 00:36:16.841
DISTRICT AND IN REVIEWING A BILL

00:36:16.908 --> 00:36:18.242
IN DOING THE RESEARCH INTO

00:36:18.309 --> 00:36:20.344
RECIDIVISM BRAWLING EVERYTHING

00:36:20.411 --> 00:36:23.314
ELSE ONE OF THE ONE OF THE STAFF

00:36:23.381 --> 00:36:23.915
TO SET OUT TO ME THE MOST WAS

00:36:23.981 --> 00:36:25.983
THE FACT THAT -- ALTHOUGH WE AS

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:29.720
A STATE -- SPEND AROUND FOUR

00:36:29.787 --> 00:36:30.354
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR

00:36:30.421 --> 00:36:32.089
ON REHABILITATION PROGRAMS THERE

00:36:32.156 --> 00:36:33.624
HAD NEVER ONCE BEEN AN AUDIT.

00:36:33.691 --> 00:36:35.493
OF THE REHABILITATION PROGRAMS --

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:37.428
THROUGH C. C. R. HOW CAN WE

00:36:37.495 --> 00:36:39.730
EFFECTIVELY SPEND THAT MONEY

00:36:39.797 --> 00:36:41.899
UNLESS WE'RE BEING TOLD OR HAVE

00:36:41.966 --> 00:36:43.334
ANY EVIDENCE TO TO POINT

00:36:43.401 --> 00:36:46.537
DIRECTLY -- TO SPECIFIC

00:36:46.604 --> 00:36:48.272
INFORMATION THAT EITHER SHOWS US

00:36:48.339 --> 00:36:49.173
THAT.

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:51.275
THESE PROGRAMS THAT WERE PAYING

00:36:51.342 --> 00:36:52.109
FOR PAYING A LOT OF MONEY FOR

00:36:52.176 --> 00:36:53.544
OUR AFFECTIVE OR THEY'RE NOT

00:36:53.611 --> 00:36:56.414
EFFECTIVE THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO --

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:57.648
WITH ANYTHING OTHER THAN MAKING

00:36:57.715 --> 00:36:59.951
SURE THAT WE ARE PERFORMING ARTS

00:37:00.017 --> 00:37:01.686
OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY AS A

00:37:01.752 --> 00:37:03.221
LEGISLATIVE BODY WHEN SPEAKER

00:37:03.287 --> 00:37:04.789
RENDON TOOK OVER HE WAS VERY

00:37:04.855 --> 00:37:06.857
CLEAR ABOUT WHAT HE WANTED US.

00:37:06.924 --> 00:37:08.192
AS THE LEGISLATURE TO DO

00:37:08.259 --> 00:37:08.826
ESPECIALLY THROUGH THE COMMITTEE

00:37:08.893 --> 00:37:10.661
PROCESS AND THAT WAS TO

00:37:10.728 --> 00:37:11.862
REESTABLISH OUR AUTHORITY

00:37:11.929 --> 00:37:12.997
THROUGH OVERSIGHT.

00:37:13.064 --> 00:37:14.565
AND THIS IS WHAT THAT IS

00:37:14.632 --> 00:37:16.267
REESTABLISHING THE LEGISLATURE'S

00:37:16.334 --> 00:37:18.102
AUTHORITY TO OVERSIGHT SO THAT

00:37:18.169 --> 00:37:19.103
WE FULLY.

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:21.706
UNDERSTAND COMPETENTLY THE

00:37:21.772 --> 00:37:23.074
DYNAMICS OF WHICH WE ARE MAKING

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:24.375
THE DECISIONS IN THE DETAILS

00:37:24.442 --> 00:37:25.242
THAT ARE DRIVING THE DECISIONS

00:37:25.309 --> 00:37:26.677
THAT WERE MAKING THAT'S WHAT

00:37:26.744 --> 00:37:28.245
THIS IS ABOUT THAT'S WHY WE

00:37:28.312 --> 00:37:30.214
REQUESTED THIS AUDIT THIS AUDIT

00:37:30.281 --> 00:37:31.749
V. YIELDED THINGS WE KNEW THINGS

00:37:31.816 --> 00:37:32.817
WE DID AND NOW.

00:37:32.883 --> 00:37:34.752
AND FOR THAT WE WERE ABLE -- TO

00:37:34.819 --> 00:37:35.886
AT LEAST I WAS ABLE TO CRAFT A

00:37:35.953 --> 00:37:37.655
PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT I HOPE

00:37:37.722 --> 00:37:39.557
IS GOING TO GO TOWARDS MAKING --

00:37:39.624 --> 00:37:41.692
THIS PROCESS AND A REDUCTION IN

00:37:41.759 --> 00:37:45.529
RECIDIVISM -- MORTGAGE OF A

00:37:45.596 --> 00:37:46.430
GUARANTEE AND THAT WE ARE.

00:37:46.497 --> 00:37:47.865
WE AS A STATE AND THE MONEY THAT

00:37:47.932 --> 00:37:50.334
WE PUT INTO WERE SEVEN REDUCTION --

00:37:50.401 --> 00:37:52.336
IS IS IS A FACT IS AS EFFECTIVE

00:37:52.403 --> 00:37:54.405
AS WE EXPECTED TO BE BUT IS AS

00:37:54.472 --> 00:37:56.240
EFFECTIVE AS OUR CONSTITUENTS

00:37:56.307 --> 00:37:57.808
AND THE PEOPLE THAT WE REPRESENT

00:37:57.875 --> 00:37:59.143
IN WHOSE MONEY WE'RE SPENDING.

00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:01.178
NEED THESE PROGRAMS TO BE SO

00:38:01.245 --> 00:38:02.480

THINGS WE THINK ARE POSITIVE --

00:39:39.343 --> 00:39:40.644
STEPS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION --

00:39:40.711 --> 00:39:42.113
BUT MR FELDER WILL GO OVER THAT

00:39:42.179 --> 00:39:43.881
SO MY PART OF THE PRESENTATION

00:39:43.948 --> 00:39:45.449
WILL BE THE KEY FINDINGS IN THE

00:39:45.516 --> 00:39:46.317
REPORT.

00:39:46.383 --> 00:39:47.818
SO WE WE TALKED ABOUT THREE

00:39:47.885 --> 00:39:48.819
DIFFERENT.

00:39:48.886 --> 00:39:50.387
KEY AREAS IN THE REPORT AND IN

00:39:50.454 --> 00:39:51.822
YOUR OPENING COMMENTS MEMBERS

00:39:51.889 --> 00:39:53.157
YOU TOUCHED ON SOME OF IT.

00:39:53.224 --> 00:39:54.759
THE FIRST SECTION OF THE REPORT

00:39:54.825 --> 00:39:56.460
REALLY TALKS ABOUT -- THE

00:39:56.527 --> 00:39:57.962
REHABILITATION PROGRAMS AND

00:39:58.028 --> 00:39:59.330
WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE BEEN

00:39:59.396 --> 00:40:00.865
EFFECTIVE IN.

00:40:00.931 --> 00:40:02.833
REDUCING RECIDIVISM AND WE

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:04.568
ACTUALLY -- IDENTIFIED CONTROL

00:40:04.635 --> 00:40:05.669
GROUPS WORKED WITH --

00:40:05.736 --> 00:40:07.872
STATISTICIAN AND DID AN ANALYSIS

00:40:07.938 --> 00:40:09.840
OF INMATES WHO HAD BEEN RELEASED

00:40:09.907 --> 00:40:12.376
AND FISCAL YEAR.

00:40:12.443 --> 00:40:13.077
FIFTEEN SIXTEEN REASON WE

00:40:13.144 --> 00:40:14.645
SELECTED THAT YEAR IT'S IT'S

00:40:14.712 --> 00:40:16.714
SUBSEQUENT TO WHEN CORRECTIONS

00:40:16.781 --> 00:40:19.016
WAS COLLECTING DATA THAT WAS

00:40:19.083 --> 00:40:20.684
MORE ACCURATE THAN IN THE PAST

00:40:20.751 --> 00:40:22.219
WHAT IT ALLOWED US TO DO IS LOOK

00:40:22.286 --> 00:40:24.722
AT RECIDIVISM JUST TWO YEARS OUT.

00:40:24.789 --> 00:40:27.057
SO -- IN IN THOSE TWO PARTICULAR

00:40:27.124 --> 00:40:28.626
YEARS WE IDENTIFIED THAT THE

00:40:28.692 --> 00:40:30.661
RECIDIVISM RATE ESSENTIALLY WAS

00:40:30.728 --> 00:40:32.863
THE SAME. FOR INMATES WHO HAD

00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:35.933
BEEN THROUGH SOME CBT COGNITIVE

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.235
BEHAVIORAL THERAPY PROGRAMS AND

00:40:38.302 --> 00:40:39.837
THOSE WHO HAD NOT RECEIVED THAT

00:40:39.904 --> 00:40:42.540
TYPE OF REHABILITATION -- AND

00:40:42.606 --> 00:40:47.745
AND ACCESS TO THOSE PARTICULAR

00:40:47.812 --> 00:40:48.646
PROGRAMS.

00:40:48.712 --> 00:40:50.147
BOTH AT YEAR ONE AND A YEAR TO

00:40:50.214 --> 00:40:50.815
YEAR -- ONE THE RECIDIVISM RATE

00:40:50.881 --> 00:40:53.584
WAS AROUND 1213% FOR BOTH GROUPS

00:40:53.651 --> 00:40:56.954
AT YEAR TWO IT WAS 2425%.

00:40:57.021 --> 00:40:58.889
SEEM SURPRISING SO WE SAID WHY

00:40:58.956 --> 00:41:00.858
IS THAT WHY IS THERE A

00:41:00.925 --> 00:41:02.159
DIFFERENCE IS IT BECAUSE THERE'S

00:41:02.226 --> 00:41:03.727
A PROBLEM WITH THE PROGRAMS NOT

00:41:03.794 --> 00:41:06.063
NECESSARILY AS AS YOU INDICATED

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:07.298
MISTER JONES SAWYER.

00:41:07.364 --> 00:41:08.599
SO WE LOOKED AT WHAT IS THE

00:41:08.666 --> 00:41:10.568
METHOD WHAT IS CORRECTIONS DOING

00:41:10.634 --> 00:41:11.969
TO ENSURE THAT.

00:41:12.036 --> 00:41:13.771
THE CORRECT THE INMATES WHO HAVE

00:41:13.838 --> 00:41:15.039
HIGH NEEDS.

00:41:15.105 --> 00:41:16.507
AND A HIGH RISK OF RECIDIVISM

00:41:16.574 --> 00:41:18.709
ARE BEING PRIORITIZED AND PLACED

00:41:18.776 --> 00:41:20.444
IN THOSE PARTICULAR PROGRAMS ARE

00:41:20.511 --> 00:41:22.012
WE ENSURING THAT THOSE PROGRAMS

00:41:22.079 --> 00:41:23.547
ARE EVIDENCE BASED THOSE ARE THE

00:41:23.614 --> 00:41:24.915
BEST PROGRAMS.

00:41:24.982 --> 00:41:26.684
THAT WE THIS WE AS A STATE

00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:28.385
SHOULD BE PROVIDING TO THOSE

00:41:28.452 --> 00:41:30.254
INMATES.

00:41:30.321 --> 00:41:31.989
AND WHAT WE FOUND IS.

00:41:32.056 --> 00:41:33.591
FIRST OF ALL -- AND LOOKING AT

00:41:33.657 --> 00:41:35.226
HOW THEY ARE ASSESSING THE

00:41:35.292 --> 00:41:36.393
DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:38.162
ASSESSES INMATES COMING IN AND

00:41:38.229 --> 00:41:39.597
THEY USED THREE DIFFERENT TOOLS

00:41:39.663 --> 00:41:41.332
AND WE IDENTIFIED THAT SOME OF

00:41:41.398 --> 00:41:42.900
THOSE TOOLS HAVE NOT BEEN

00:41:42.967 --> 00:41:43.868
VALIDATED.

00:41:43.934 --> 00:41:45.636
AS TO AS TO THEIR EFFECTIVENESS

00:41:45.703 --> 00:41:47.671
IN IDENTIFYING HIGH NEED HIGH

00:41:47.738 --> 00:41:50.441
RECIDIVISM HADN'T BEEN EVALUATED

00:41:50.507 --> 00:41:52.042
IN AT LEAST.

00:41:52.109 --> 00:41:54.245
IN ONE CASE COMPASS WHICH IS

00:41:54.311 --> 00:41:57.481
ASSESSES -- AN INMATE --

00:41:57.548 --> 00:41:59.550
CRIMINAL RECORD LOOKS AT WHAT

00:41:59.617 --> 00:42:01.652
TYPES OF A COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL

00:42:01.719 --> 00:42:03.454
PROGRAMS WOULD BE HELPFUL TO

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:04.788
THAT INDIVIDUAL.

00:42:04.855 --> 00:42:06.023
THAT HAD NOT BEEN REASSESSED

00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:07.658
SINCE.

00:42:07.725 --> 00:42:08.225
TWENTY TEN AND WHEN THEY'RE

00:42:08.292 --> 00:42:10.194
ASSESSING IT TWENTY TEN THEY'RE

00:42:10.261 --> 00:42:11.528
USING DATA THAT'S EVEN OLDER.

00:42:11.595 --> 00:42:13.497
NOW ANOTHER ANOTHER TOOL THEY

00:42:13.564 --> 00:42:16.333
USE IS CALL IS A CS ARE RAY.

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.168
AND THAT REALLY LOOKS OUT THERE

00:42:18.235 --> 00:42:19.637
IT'S CALLED THE STATUS STATIC

00:42:19.703 --> 00:42:21.672
RISK ASSESSMENT THAT'S LOOKING

00:42:21.739 --> 00:42:23.107
AT THE RISK OF RECIDIVISM BUT

00:42:23.173 --> 00:42:24.575
AGAIN THAT TOOL HAVEN'T BEEN

00:42:24.642 --> 00:42:26.744
EVALUATED SINCE.

00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:27.278
TWENTY THIRTEEN AND AGAIN

00:42:27.344 --> 00:42:28.913
THEY'RE USING DATA THAT'S QUITE

00:42:28.979 --> 00:42:33.651
OLD SO THESE ASSESSMENT TOOLS

00:42:33.717 --> 00:42:35.286
COMPASS CS ARE A TAPE IS THEIR

00:42:35.352 --> 00:42:36.387
ACADEMIC IT'S ARE BASICALLY A

00:42:36.453 --> 00:42:39.089
TEST OF ACADEMIC BASIC EDUCATION.

00:42:39.156 --> 00:42:41.892
ARM THAT HAD BEEN REASSESSED AND

00:42:41.959 --> 00:42:43.994
EVALUATED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN SO

00:42:44.061 --> 00:42:44.528
WE HAD A LITTLE BIT MORE

00:42:44.595 --> 00:42:46.096
CONFIDENCE AND THAT PARTICULAR

00:42:46.163 --> 00:42:47.865
PROGRAM AND THAT FEEDS INTO.

00:42:47.932 --> 00:42:49.400
THE TYPES OF ACADEMIC PROGRAMS

00:42:49.466 --> 00:42:51.335
THAT INMATES WOULD RECEIVE BUT

00:42:51.402 --> 00:42:52.903
BOTH COMPASS AND CS ARE A HAVE

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:54.838
NOT BEEN EVALUATED AND DETERMINE

00:42:54.905 --> 00:42:56.140
WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE REALLY

00:42:56.206 --> 00:42:58.609
THE APPROPRIATE TOOL TO BE USING.

00:42:58.676 --> 00:42:59.810
AND ASSESSING INMATES IN

00:42:59.877 --> 00:43:00.778
DETERMINING WHETHER THEY HAVE

00:43:00.844 --> 00:43:02.313
HIGH NEEDS AND WHAT TYPES OF

00:43:02.379 --> 00:43:03.480
PROGRAMS THEY SHOULD BE PLACED

00:43:03.547 --> 00:43:05.215
IN SO THAT WAS THE FIRST CONCERN

00:43:05.282 --> 00:43:06.550
THAT WE IDENTIFIED.

00:43:06.617 --> 00:43:07.885
THE SECOND CONCERN IS WHEN WE

00:43:07.952 --> 00:43:09.253
ACTUALLY LOOKED AT THE EVIDENCE

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:11.989
THAT THE THIS CBT PROGRAMS WE

00:43:12.056 --> 00:43:13.157
FOUND THAT A VARIETY OF

00:43:13.223 --> 00:43:14.491
INSTITUTIONS WERE NOT

00:43:14.558 --> 00:43:16.026
NECESSARILY ENSURING.

00:43:16.093 --> 00:43:18.529
THAT THE PROGRAMS WERE EVIDENCE

00:43:18.595 --> 00:43:19.830
BASED -- THERE'S A UP YOU

00:43:19.897 --> 00:43:21.465
CLEARING HOUSE THAT ACTUALLY HAS

00:43:21.532 --> 00:43:22.800
AN EX THAT HAS DONE EXTENSIVE

00:43:22.866 --> 00:43:24.134
RESEARCH ON EVIDENCE BASED

00:43:24.201 --> 00:43:25.836
PROGRAMS HAS ESSENTIALLY A

00:43:25.903 --> 00:43:27.638
CATALOG OF PROGRAMS THAT

00:43:27.705 --> 00:43:29.640
INSTITUTIONS COULD USE -- AND

00:43:29.707 --> 00:43:31.608
CORRECTIONS CONTRACTS ACTUALLY

00:43:31.675 --> 00:43:33.978
REQUIRE VENDORS IS A CONTRACT

00:43:34.044 --> 00:43:36.213
OUT FOR MOST OF THESE PROGRAMS.

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:40.484
TO USE EVIDENCE BASED.

00:43:40.551 --> 00:43:40.951
CURRICULA.

00:43:41.018 --> 00:43:41.618
BUT WHAT WE WERE FINDING IS THEY

00:43:41.685 --> 00:43:42.219
ARE NOT MONITORING WHETHER OR

00:43:42.286 --> 00:43:44.488
NOT THOSE VENDORS ACTUALLY ARE

00:43:44.555 --> 00:43:46.190
USING THAT TYPE OF CURRICULA.

00:43:46.256 --> 00:43:48.659
AND WHAT WE FOUND AT AT TEN OF

00:43:48.726 --> 00:43:50.060
THE INSTITUTIONS IS.

00:43:50.127 --> 00:43:52.963
THERE WAS A RANGE BETWEEN A LOW

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:57.334
OF THREE OR 4% TO A HIGH OF 22%

00:43:57.401 --> 00:43:59.069
OF THESE CLASS OR NOT ACTUALLY

00:43:59.136 --> 00:44:01.138
56% SO LET ME LET ME BACK UP FOR

00:44:01.205 --> 00:44:02.039
SECOND.

00:44:02.106 --> 00:44:03.741
SO WE REVIEWED VENDORS TEN

00:44:03.807 --> 00:44:06.744
INSTITUTIONS ON AVERAGE ABOUT

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:09.480
17% OF THOSE PROGRAMS THOSE CBT

00:44:09.546 --> 00:44:12.282
PROGRAMS WERE NOT EVIDENCE BASED

00:44:12.349 --> 00:44:14.018
BUT THAT REALLY DID RANGE IT WAS

00:44:14.084 --> 00:44:16.687
A LOW OF ABOUT 3% TO A HIGH OF

00:44:16.754 --> 00:44:19.456
56% SO OVER HALF OF THE PROGRAMS.

00:44:19.523 --> 00:44:21.692
AT A PARTICULAR INSTITUTION RJ

00:44:21.759 --> 00:44:24.228
DONOVAN WERE USING CBT PROGRAMS

00:44:24.294 --> 00:44:26.130
THAT WERE NOT EVIDENCE BASED SO

00:44:26.196 --> 00:44:27.431
THERE WASN'T SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE

00:44:27.498 --> 00:44:28.766
TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THIS IS THE

00:44:28.832 --> 00:44:30.234
APPROPRIATE TYPE OF PROGRAM TO

00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:32.302
BE PROVIDING. TO INMATES WHO

00:44:32.369 --> 00:44:34.538
HAVE A HIGH NEED FOR THESE TYPES

00:44:34.605 --> 00:44:36.640
OF SERVICES TO TO YOU KNOW

00:44:36.707 --> 00:44:38.108
STRENGTHEN THEIR ABILITY FOR

00:44:38.175 --> 00:44:39.410
WHEN THEY'RE RELEASED TO NOT

00:44:39.476 --> 00:44:40.911
RESET OF EIGHT AND NOT RETURN TO

00:44:40.978 --> 00:44:41.678
PRISON.

00:44:41.745 --> 00:44:43.080
SO WE REALLY HAD CONCERNS ABOUT

00:44:43.147 --> 00:44:44.648
THAT THOSE EVIDENCE BASED

00:44:44.715 --> 00:44:45.682
PROGRAMS CORRECTIONS NOT

00:44:45.749 --> 00:44:47.017
MONITORING THOSE PARTICULAR

00:44:47.084 --> 00:44:48.786
PROGRAMS.

00:44:48.852 --> 00:44:50.487
NOW THEY HIRED UC IRVINE TO

00:44:50.554 --> 00:44:52.089
ASSIST THEM IN DETERMINING HOW

00:44:52.156 --> 00:44:54.558
DO WE MANAGE THESE CONTRACTS

00:44:54.625 --> 00:44:55.893
WHAT TYPES OF THINGS SHOULD WE

00:44:55.959 --> 00:44:57.261
BE DOING AND FAR AS FAR AS A

00:44:57.327 --> 00:44:58.362
PROGRAM REVIEW.

00:44:58.429 --> 00:44:59.496
NOT JUST IDENTIFYING WHETHER

00:44:59.563 --> 00:45:01.799
IT'S EVIDENCE BASED BUT ACTUALLY

00:45:01.865 --> 00:45:03.500
GOING OUT AND OBSERVING.

00:45:03.567 --> 00:45:05.269
US SOME OF THE PROGRAMS SPENDING

00:45:05.335 --> 00:45:06.437
MORE TIME OUT AT THE

00:45:06.503 --> 00:45:08.772
INSTITUTIONS INCREASING THE

00:45:08.839 --> 00:45:11.041
NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS SO THE UC

00:45:11.108 --> 00:45:12.543
IRVINE HAD A VARIETY OF

00:45:12.609 --> 00:45:15.212
RECOMMENDATIONS. TO GIVE OUR

00:45:15.279 --> 00:45:16.747
CORRECTIONS THE OPPORTUNITY GET

00:45:16.814 --> 00:45:18.048
OUT THERE AND DO A BETTER JOB OF

00:45:18.115 --> 00:45:19.950
MONITORING THESE VENDORS WHO ARE

00:45:20.017 --> 00:45:21.452
PROVIDING THESE PROGRAMS.

00:45:21.518 --> 00:45:22.886
WHEN WE ASKED CORRECTIONS ABOUT

00:45:22.953 --> 00:45:24.755
THAT THEY THEY INTENDED TO PILOT

00:45:24.822 --> 00:45:27.324
IT AND STARTED PILOTING -- THIS

00:45:27.391 --> 00:45:29.326
NEW PROGRAM REVIEW AND A COUPLE

00:45:29.393 --> 00:45:30.894
OF INSTITUTIONS AND THEY INTEND

00:45:30.961 --> 00:45:31.895
TO ROLL THAT OUT TO MORE

00:45:31.962 --> 00:45:33.764
INSTITUTIONS OR OVER THE COMING

00:45:33.831 --> 00:45:35.065
YEAR THEY THEY INTENDED TO START

00:45:35.132 --> 00:45:37.034
DOING THAT IN JANUARY OF THIS

00:45:37.101 --> 00:45:37.835
YEAR SO HOPEFULLY WHEN THEY

00:45:37.901 --> 00:45:38.368
PRESENT.

00:45:38.435 --> 00:45:39.937
THEY'LL HAVE MORE INFORMATION

00:45:40.003 --> 00:45:41.205
FOR YOU ABOUT THAT BUT THAT'S A

00:45:41.271 --> 00:45:42.973
KEY ISSUE IT'S NOT NECESSARILY

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:46.610
THE PROGRAMS AREN'T ANY GOOD BUT

00:45:46.677 --> 00:45:47.211
YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE

00:45:47.277 --> 00:45:48.445
USING THE APPROACH.

00:45:48.512 --> 00:45:49.279
TYPES OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE GOING

00:45:49.346 --> 00:45:49.913
TO BENEFIT THE INMATES AND THAT

00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:51.482
ARE PROVEN PROGRAMS AND EVIDENCE

00:45:51.548 --> 00:45:53.117
BASED PROGRAMS HAVE CLEARLY BEEN

00:45:53.183 --> 00:45:55.052
PROVEN TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE IN

00:45:55.119 --> 00:45:56.987
REDUCING RECIDIVISM SO WE NEED

00:45:57.054 --> 00:45:57.955
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

00:45:58.021 --> 00:45:59.490
INSTITUTIONS ARE USING THOSE

00:45:59.556 --> 00:46:01.859
TYPES OF PROGRAMS.

00:46:01.925 --> 00:46:03.494
THE SECOND AREA THE REPORT --

00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:05.262
TALKS ABOUT PLACEMENT AND

00:46:05.329 --> 00:46:06.864
DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT THE

00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:08.866
INSTITUTIONS ARE APPROPRIATELY

00:46:08.932 --> 00:46:10.934
PRIORITIZING INDIVIDUALS WHO

00:46:11.001 --> 00:46:12.202
HAVE HIGH NEED.

00:46:12.269 --> 00:46:14.138
AND HIGH RISK A RESET OF A RESET

00:46:14.204 --> 00:46:16.440
EVADING -- INTO INSTITUTIONS AND

00:46:16.507 --> 00:46:18.809
WHAT WE FOUND IS THEY ARE NOT

00:46:18.876 --> 00:46:21.044
DOING THAT -- UNFORTUNATELY WE

00:46:21.111 --> 00:46:24.915
FOUND THAT IN FIFTY FISCAL YEAR

00:46:24.982 --> 00:46:27.251
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WE IDENTIFIED

00:46:27.317 --> 00:46:27.885
TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND INMATES WHO

00:46:27.951 --> 00:46:29.386
HAD BEEN RELEASED -- WHO HAD

00:46:29.453 --> 00:46:31.121
MODERATE TO HIGH RISK IN BOTH

00:46:31.188 --> 00:46:33.557
CATEGORIES HIGH RISK HIGH NEEDS

00:46:33.624 --> 00:46:35.259
AND HIGH RISK OF RETURNING TO

00:46:35.325 --> 00:46:37.094
PRESENT RESET EVADING-- BUT OF

00:46:37.161 --> 00:46:39.963
THOSE INDIVIDUALS ONLY ABOUT 30%

00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:42.432
38% OR EVEN A SIGN.

00:46:42.499 --> 00:46:44.101
TO A REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS OR

00:46:44.168 --> 00:46:45.769
HAD COMPLETED ANY PORTION OF

00:46:45.836 --> 00:46:47.237
THOSE PARTICULAR PROGRAMS THERE

00:46:47.304 --> 00:46:49.206
WAS A HIGH NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS.

00:46:49.273 --> 00:46:50.874
WHO DIDN'T HAVE HIGH NEEDS OR

00:46:50.941 --> 00:46:52.442
WHO WERE AT HIGH RISK OF

00:46:52.509 --> 00:46:54.011
RECIDIVISM RECEIVING CORPS

00:46:54.077 --> 00:46:55.012
ENDING UP IN SOME OF THESE

00:46:55.078 --> 00:46:56.513
PROGRAMS SO CORRECTIONS WAS NOT

00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:58.382
DOING A GOOD JOB AT THE VARIOUS

00:46:58.448 --> 00:46:59.550
INSTITUTIONS?

00:46:59.616 --> 00:47:02.186
OF MAKING SURE THAT THEY PUT

00:47:02.252 --> 00:47:03.687
THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO.

00:47:03.754 --> 00:47:05.088
REALLY NEEDED THESE PROGRAMS AT

00:47:05.155 --> 00:47:06.523
THE TOP OF THE LIST AND GAVE

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:09.993
THEM PRIORITY TO GET INTO SOME

00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:11.428
OF THESE THESE COURSES.

00:47:11.495 --> 00:47:12.729
I'M ANOTHER ISSUE THAT THAT WE

00:47:12.796 --> 00:47:13.997
HEARD FROM THE DEPARTMENT AND

00:47:14.064 --> 00:47:16.099
REALLY WAS VALIDATED BY SOME OF

00:47:16.166 --> 00:47:16.934
THE WORK THAT THE OFFICE OF THE

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.468
INSPECTOR GENERAL DOES THEY DO

00:47:18.535 --> 00:47:20.237
SOME OVERSIGHT OF THE DEPARTMENT

00:47:20.304 --> 00:47:20.904
CORRECTIONS AS I'M SURE YOU'RE

00:47:20.971 --> 00:47:21.905
AWARE.

00:47:21.972 --> 00:47:23.740
AND THEY FOUND THAT.

00:47:23.807 --> 00:47:25.209
YOU KNOW THE VACANCY RATE THEY

00:47:25.275 --> 00:47:27.978
STILL SUFFER FROM ISSUES RELATED

00:47:28.045 --> 00:47:29.580
TO TRYING TO HIRE INDIVIDUALS

00:47:29.646 --> 00:47:31.315
BOTH FOR ACADEMIC AND VOCATIONAL

00:47:31.381 --> 00:47:32.883
PROGRAMS AS I SAID THERE

00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:34.384
COGNITIVE BEHVIOR PROGRAMS THEY

00:47:34.451 --> 00:47:35.786
PRETTY MUCH CONTRACT THAT OUT

00:47:35.852 --> 00:47:38.222
WITH VENDORS -- BUT FOR ACADEMIC

00:47:38.288 --> 00:47:39.523
AND VOCATIONAL EDUCATION%

00:47:39.590 --> 00:47:41.725
PROGRAMS THEY CONTINUE TO HAVE.

00:47:41.792 --> 00:47:43.126
A VACANCY RATES THAT ARE A

00:47:43.193 --> 00:47:44.861
LITTLE HIGHER THAN THEY THEY

00:47:44.928 --> 00:47:46.697
BELIEVE WOULD BE BEST -- FOR THE

00:47:46.763 --> 00:47:48.532
INSTITUTIONS AND FOR THEM TO BE

00:47:48.599 --> 00:47:50.467
ABLE TO MEET THEIR THEIR TARGETS

00:47:50.534 --> 00:47:52.202
FOR PROVIDING THESE TYPES OF

00:47:52.269 --> 00:47:54.371
PROGRAMS TO THE INMATES -- SO

00:47:54.438 --> 00:47:56.206
THAT REMAINS AN ISSUE NOW WHAT

00:47:56.273 --> 00:47:57.507
DID WE HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT

00:47:57.574 --> 00:47:58.442
ONE OF THE THINGS WE HEAR IS

00:47:58.508 --> 00:47:59.643
THEY DO HAVE DIFFICULTY IN

00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:01.078
HIRING INDIVIDUALS.

00:48:01.144 --> 00:48:02.346
IN CERTAIN LOCATIONS IN

00:48:02.412 --> 00:48:03.714
CALIFORNIA A CERTAIN

00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:06.717
INSTITUTIONS AND I'M SURE

00:48:06.783 --> 00:48:07.317
MEMBERS YOU HAVE HEARD THAT IN

00:48:07.384 --> 00:48:07.584
THE PAST.

00:48:07.651 --> 00:48:10.187
THE LAST ISSUE WITH RESPECT --

00:48:10.254 --> 00:48:11.188
TO PLACEMENT.

00:48:11.255 --> 00:48:13.724
IN INTO THESE VARIOUS PROGRAMS

00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:15.592
IS THE ENROLLMENT RATES.

00:48:15.659 --> 00:48:17.961
SO THEY HAVE THEY HAVE A GOAL OF

00:48:18.028 --> 00:48:21.365
PROVIDING AT LEAST 70%.

00:48:21.431 --> 00:48:23.033
OF THE TARGET POPULATION THESE

00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:25.035
TYPES OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS

00:48:25.102 --> 00:48:26.336
BUT WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE

00:48:26.403 --> 00:48:29.139
CAPACITY FOR ACADEMIC PROGRAMS

00:48:29.206 --> 00:48:31.341
VOTE GET PROGRAMS AND C. B. T.

00:48:31.408 --> 00:48:32.542
PROGRAMS THEY WERE NOT AT

00:48:32.609 --> 00:48:34.411
CAPACITY THEY HAD THE BUDGET FOR

00:48:34.478 --> 00:48:35.112
IT.

00:48:35.178 --> 00:48:36.480
BUT THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO ENROLL

00:48:36.546 --> 00:48:39.916
AS MANY INMATES AS THE PROGRAMS

00:48:39.983 --> 00:48:41.418
WERE PROVIDED -- BUDGET

00:48:41.485 --> 00:48:44.254
AUTHORITY -- ACADEMIC WAS ABOUT

00:48:44.321 --> 00:48:45.889
76% OF CAPACITY BUDGETED

00:48:45.956 --> 00:48:49.760
CAPACITY CBT ABOUT 76% INVOKE AT

00:48:49.826 --> 00:48:51.228
ABOUT 68%.

00:48:51.295 --> 00:48:52.529
NOW IN ADDITION TO THE HIRING

00:48:52.596 --> 00:48:54.531
ISSUES SOME OF THE INSTITUTIONS

00:48:54.598 --> 00:48:56.566
RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT PHYSICAL

00:48:56.633 --> 00:48:58.935
SPACE -- AT FOLSOM IN PARTICULAR

00:48:59.002 --> 00:49:00.537
THERE WERE SOME ISSUES RELATED

00:49:00.604 --> 00:49:02.105
TO THE FACILITIES THEIR WORDS A

00:49:02.172 --> 00:49:04.308
ROOF THAT NEEDED REPAIR SO THEY

00:49:04.374 --> 00:49:05.309
WERE HAVING TO SHUT DOWN SO.

00:49:05.375 --> 00:49:06.910
SOME OF THE COURSES AND SOME OF

00:49:06.977 --> 00:49:08.245
THE CLASSES WERE NOT AVAILABLE

00:49:08.312 --> 00:49:09.846
TO INMATES BECAUSE THEY HAD TO

00:49:09.913 --> 00:49:11.348
INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES.

00:49:11.415 --> 00:49:12.916
AT RJ DONOVAN THEY TALK TO US

00:49:12.983 --> 00:49:15.252
ABOUT -- ISSUES THAT THE FIRE

00:49:15.319 --> 00:49:17.120
MARSHAL REYES WHERE THEIR CLASS

00:49:17.187 --> 00:49:18.789
CLASS SIZES WERE TOO LARGE SO

00:49:18.855 --> 00:49:20.190
THEY WERE FORCED TO REDUCE SOME

00:49:20.257 --> 00:49:21.425
OF THOSE CLASS SIZES.

00:49:21.491 --> 00:49:23.093
BUT WHEN WE ASK CORRECTIONS OKAY

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:24.895
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ADDRESS

00:49:24.961 --> 00:49:26.563
SOME OF THESE ISSUES -- OF SOME

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:27.998
OF THE RESPONSES WERE RELATIVELY

00:49:28.065 --> 00:49:29.299
SHORT THEY HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT

00:49:29.366 --> 00:49:31.068
WHAT THEY NEEDED TO DO TO

00:49:31.134 --> 00:49:32.402
INCREASE YOU KNOW PHYSICAL

00:49:32.469 --> 00:49:33.870
CAPACITY IN ADDITION TO THE

00:49:33.937 --> 00:49:35.972
HIRING -- ISSUES THAT I JUST

00:49:36.039 --> 00:49:37.507
SPOKE ABOUT A LITTLE BIT AGO.

00:49:37.574 --> 00:49:39.276
NOW ON THE POSITIVE SIDE AS YOU

00:49:39.343 --> 00:49:41.478
SAID MISTER JONES SAWYER WE

00:49:41.545 --> 00:49:42.746
LOOKED AT CAL PIAA AND THEIR

00:49:42.813 --> 00:49:44.414
THEIR RECIDIVISM RATE IS QUITE

00:49:44.481 --> 00:49:45.816
LOW I MEAN IT WAS ASSESSED BACK

00:49:45.882 --> 00:49:48.418
IN JULY OF TWENTY ELEVEN AND IT

00:49:48.485 --> 00:49:51.521
WAS AT 7% -- BUT CALPE CALPE I

00:49:51.588 --> 00:49:52.856
ATE THEIR ENROLLMENT RATES WERE

00:49:52.923 --> 00:49:54.324
RELATIVELY LOW WHEN WE LOOKED AT

00:49:54.391 --> 00:49:56.526
THEM WAS ABOUT 48%.

00:49:56.593 --> 00:49:58.028
SO WE TALK TO THEM ABOUT THAT

00:49:58.095 --> 00:49:59.930
AND AND WHAT THEIR RESPONSE TO

00:49:59.996 --> 00:50:01.398
US WAS.

00:50:01.465 --> 00:50:02.666
THEY WEREN'T NECESSARILY AND

00:50:02.733 --> 00:50:04.134
I'LL USE MY TERMINOLOGY IN THE

00:50:04.201 --> 00:50:05.602
ROOM WHEN DECISIONS WERE MADE

00:50:05.669 --> 00:50:08.705
ABOUT ASSIGNING INMATES -- TO

00:50:08.772 --> 00:50:10.107
EITHER REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS

00:50:10.173 --> 00:50:11.842
ARE PRO OR JOBS IN THE

00:50:11.908 --> 00:50:13.877
INSTITUTIONS AND AND CAL P. I.

00:50:13.944 --> 00:50:15.512
A.'S SAYING WE NEED TO BE PART

00:50:15.579 --> 00:50:17.280
OF THAT DECISION MAKING PROCESS

00:50:17.347 --> 00:50:18.648
BECAUSE THEN WE CAN INCREASE THE

00:50:18.715 --> 00:50:22.619
ENROLLMENT.

00:50:22.686 --> 00:50:23.820
AND SOME OF THE PROGRAM -- THAT

00:50:23.887 --> 00:50:24.621
WE HAVE AND THAT HAVE BEEN VERY

00:50:24.688 --> 00:50:26.323
SUCCESSFUL -- WITH RESPECT -- TO

00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:27.591
INMATES WHO ARE RELEASED TO GET

00:50:27.657 --> 00:50:29.326
GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT AND DO NOT

00:50:29.393 --> 00:50:30.994
RESET AVE IT'S A VERY LOW

00:50:31.061 --> 00:50:32.662
PERCENTAGE AND AND THEY INTEND

00:50:32.729 --> 00:50:33.730
TO HAVE AN UPDATE OF THEIR

00:50:33.797 --> 00:50:36.299
ANALYSIS ON RECIDIVISM IN MAY OF

00:50:36.366 --> 00:50:38.735
THIS YEAR -- AND HOPEFULLY IT'S

00:50:38.802 --> 00:50:40.103
RELATIVELY CLOSE TO TO PASS

00:50:40.170 --> 00:50:43.407
PERFORMANCE NOW THERE HAS BEEN.

00:50:43.473 --> 00:50:45.509
A PILOT PROGRAM THAT HAS BEEN

00:50:45.575 --> 00:50:47.944
STARTED -- BY CAL P. I. A AND

00:50:48.011 --> 00:50:49.045
WERE WORKING WITH CORRECTIONS

00:50:49.112 --> 00:50:51.448
WORK CAL P. I. A IS NOW PART OF

00:50:51.515 --> 00:50:53.016
THAT DECISION MAKING PROCESS.

00:50:53.083 --> 00:50:54.418
AND WE'RE SEEING INCREASING

00:50:54.484 --> 00:50:55.752
ENROLLMENT AND SOME OF THE CAL

00:50:55.819 --> 00:50:57.754
PI AIR PROGRAMS IT INCREASED

00:50:57.821 --> 00:50:59.222
FROM JULY THIS PILOT JUST

00:50:59.289 --> 00:51:01.491
STARTED THIS LAST YEAR -- IN IN

00:51:01.558 --> 00:51:04.161
JULY IT INCREASE IT WAS AT 44%

00:51:04.227 --> 00:51:06.296
AND IT WENT UP 253% IN OCTOBER

00:51:06.363 --> 00:51:07.831
OF EIGHTEEN SO HOPEFULLY THIS

00:51:07.898 --> 00:51:10.400
PROGRAM WILL CONTINUE -- TO

00:51:10.467 --> 00:51:12.169
ALLOW AND ENCOURAGE INMATES TO

00:51:12.235 --> 00:51:13.437
ENROLL IN SOME OF THE P. I. A

00:51:13.503 --> 00:51:14.938
PROGRAMS AND WHERE THEY CAN

00:51:15.005 --> 00:51:15.572
REALLY GAIN SOME.

00:51:15.639 --> 00:51:17.974
SOME -- AND VALUABLE SKILLS --

00:51:18.041 --> 00:51:19.476
UPON YOU KNOW PRIOR TO THE

00:51:19.543 --> 00:51:20.877
RELEASE OFF FROM THE

00:51:20.944 --> 00:51:21.978
INSTITUTIONS.

00:51:22.045 --> 00:51:23.980
THE LAST SECTION IS RELATED TO

00:51:24.047 --> 00:51:25.982
OVERSIGHT PERFORMANCE MEASURES

00:51:26.049 --> 00:51:27.350
METRICS THOSE SORTS OF THINGS

00:51:27.417 --> 00:51:29.085
AND AGAIN THIS IS ANOTHER AREA

00:51:29.152 --> 00:51:30.520
WHERE THE DEPARTMENT CORRECTIONS

00:51:30.587 --> 00:51:31.788
IS FALLING SHORT WE WEREN'T

00:51:31.855 --> 00:51:33.690
SEEING A LOTS OF PERFORMANCE

00:51:33.757 --> 00:51:33.957
MEASURES.

00:51:34.024 --> 00:51:36.226
ARE DEVELOPED WE ACTUALLY LOOKED

00:51:36.293 --> 00:51:37.627
AT WHAT SOME OTHER STATES WERE

00:51:37.694 --> 00:51:39.563
DOING THE STATE OF MINNESOTA

00:51:39.629 --> 00:51:41.364
ACTUALLY RECEIVE SOME FEDERAL

00:51:41.431 --> 00:51:43.166
MONEY THERE'S A FEDERAL GRANT.

00:51:43.233 --> 00:51:44.367
THAT'S AVAILABLE TO STATES

00:51:44.434 --> 00:51:45.836
CALLED STATEWIDE RECIDIVISM

00:51:45.902 --> 00:51:47.471
REDUCTION GRANT THE STATE OF

00:51:47.537 --> 00:51:48.905
MINNESOTA PUT TOGETHER SOME

00:51:48.972 --> 00:51:50.941
METRICS AND SOME GOALS FOR

00:51:51.007 --> 00:51:53.510
REDUCING RECIDIVISM -- THEIR

00:51:53.577 --> 00:51:54.845
FIRST CALL WAS TO REDUCE IT BY

00:51:54.911 --> 00:51:56.513
THREE I THINK IT WAS AROUND 3%

00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:57.881
AND THEY RECEIVED A THREE

00:51:57.948 --> 00:52:00.016
MILLION DOLLAR GRANT FROM THE

00:52:00.083 --> 00:52:02.118
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT US DEPARTMENT

00:52:02.185 --> 00:52:04.187
OF JUSTICE. TO BASICALLY ENHANCE

00:52:04.254 --> 00:52:05.956
SOME OF THEIR PROGRAMS TO REALLY

00:52:06.022 --> 00:52:08.492
FOCUS ON COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL

00:52:08.558 --> 00:52:09.860
THERAPY PROVIDING.

00:52:09.926 --> 00:52:11.561
SERVICES TO INMATES IN IN THE

00:52:11.628 --> 00:52:12.863
STATE OF MINNESOTA TO HOPEFULLY

00:52:12.929 --> 00:52:17.100
REDUCE THAT RECIDIVISM RATE AND

00:52:17.167 --> 00:52:18.101
THEIR STATE AS WELL.

00:52:18.168 --> 00:52:18.668
BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT WE

00:52:18.735 --> 00:52:19.169
BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT

00:52:19.236 --> 00:52:20.370
CORRECTIONS REALLY NEEDS TO

00:52:20.437 --> 00:52:21.838
DEVELOP METRICS.

00:52:21.905 --> 00:52:23.206
FOR HOW MANY INMATES DO THEY

00:52:23.273 --> 00:52:24.641
WANT TO ENROLL IN THESE

00:52:24.708 --> 00:52:26.443
PARTICULAR -- PROGRAMS WHAT

00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:27.911
ABOUT COMPLETION RATES YOU KNOW

00:52:27.978 --> 00:52:29.346
YOU'RE NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO

00:52:29.412 --> 00:52:30.614
HAVE A 100% COMPLETION BUT

00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:31.848
YOU'VE GOT TO SET YOURSELF SOME

00:52:31.915 --> 00:52:34.618
GOALS. FOR GETTING.

00:52:34.684 --> 00:52:36.052
THE CORRECT INMATES WHO HAVE

00:52:36.119 --> 00:52:37.621
HIGH NEEDS AND HIGHER AND HIGHER

00:52:37.687 --> 00:52:39.456
RISK A RESET OF AIDING INTO THE

00:52:39.523 --> 00:52:41.591
PROGRAMS -- AND REALLY MEASURE

00:52:41.658 --> 00:52:44.027
AGAINST HOW SUCCESSFUL YOU ARE

00:52:44.094 --> 00:52:45.428
DOING THAT.

00:52:45.495 --> 00:52:47.230
NOW THEY THEY DEPARTMENT TALK TO

00:52:47.297 --> 00:52:48.598
US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT --

00:52:48.665 --> 00:52:49.966
COORDINATING AND WORKING WITH

00:52:50.033 --> 00:52:51.668
EXTERNAL RESEARCHERS TO CONDUCT

00:52:51.735 --> 00:52:53.270
A PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF

00:52:53.336 --> 00:52:54.671
THEIR PROGRAMS FROM A COST

00:52:54.738 --> 00:52:57.140
EFFECTIVENESS STANDPOINT AND

00:52:57.207 --> 00:52:59.042
LOOKING AT A DEVELOPING METRICS

00:52:59.109 --> 00:53:00.844
ETCETERA THAT WAS DURING DURING

00:53:00.911 --> 00:53:02.646
THE AUDIT ITSELF -- BUT ALTHOUGH

00:53:02.712 --> 00:53:04.080
THEY HAD DONE THAT BY THE TIME

00:53:04.147 --> 00:53:05.782
WE HAD COMPLETED OUR FIELD WORK

00:53:05.849 --> 00:53:07.117
THEY REALLY HADN'T TAKEN ANY

00:53:07.183 --> 00:53:08.251
FORMAL STEPS.

00:53:08.318 --> 00:53:09.719
ARE TO INITIATE THE PROCESS

00:53:09.786 --> 00:53:11.221
THAT'S WHY WE FELT THE

00:53:11.288 --> 00:53:13.189
LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATION --

00:53:13.256 --> 00:53:14.891
AND WE'VE SEEN THE BILLS -- THAT

00:53:14.958 --> 00:53:16.893
THAT ARE ARE OUT THERE A LOOKING

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:18.528
AT CARRYING OUT SOME OF OUR

00:53:18.595 --> 00:53:19.462
IMPLEMENTING SOME OF OUR

00:53:19.529 --> 00:53:21.097
RECOMMENDATIONS AND AND WE WERE

00:53:21.164 --> 00:53:22.232
WE'RE EXCITED TO SEE THAT

00:53:22.299 --> 00:53:23.633
BECAUSE WE THINK THAT'S REALLY

00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:25.168
REALLY IMPORTANT NEEDS TO HAPPEN --

00:53:25.235 --> 00:53:26.403
BUT WE HAVE NOT SEEN MUCH

00:53:26.469 --> 00:53:30.240
PROGRESS WITH RESPECT TO THAT --

00:53:30.307 --> 00:53:32.008
THE ALSO THE THE DEPARTMENT

00:53:32.075 --> 00:53:33.376
CORRECTIONS HADN'T ANALYZE

00:53:33.443 --> 00:53:34.744
WHETHER OR NOT THERE PROGRAMS

00:53:34.811 --> 00:53:36.646
WERE REDUCING RECIDIVISM -- THEY

00:53:36.713 --> 00:53:38.348
DID CONTRACT WITH UC IRVINE

00:53:38.415 --> 00:53:40.684
AGAIN TO EXAMINE WAYS TO MAKE

00:53:40.750 --> 00:53:42.986
SURE THAT THEIR C. B. T. CLASSES

00:53:43.053 --> 00:53:44.921
WERE UNIFORMED AND WERE BEING

00:53:44.988 --> 00:53:45.689
PRESENTED.

00:53:45.755 --> 00:53:47.657
AND ANY UNIFORMED MANNER THEY

00:53:47.724 --> 00:53:49.459
TALK ABOUT PROGRAM FIDELITY AND

00:53:49.526 --> 00:53:50.660
THERE HAS BEEN RESEARCH DONE AS

00:53:50.727 --> 00:53:52.562
FAR AS PROGRAM FIDELITY IF THESE

00:53:52.629 --> 00:53:53.930
PROGRAMS ARE REALLY TRULY

00:53:53.997 --> 00:53:55.298
EVIDENCE BASED.

00:53:55.365 --> 00:53:57.567
AND ARE BEING PROVIDED TO

00:53:57.634 --> 00:53:59.369
INDIVIDUALS ARE INMATES IN THE

00:53:59.436 --> 00:54:00.971
INSTITUTIONS CONSISTENTLY THEN

00:54:01.037 --> 00:54:02.305
YOU WILL REALLY HAVE POSITIVE

00:54:02.372 --> 00:54:04.507
OUTCOMES SO YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE

00:54:04.574 --> 00:54:06.142
SURE THAT YOU'RE USING EVIDENCE

00:54:06.209 --> 00:54:07.811
BASED PROGRAMS YOUR YOUR

00:54:07.877 --> 00:54:09.179
ADMINISTERING THOSE PROGRAMS

00:54:09.245 --> 00:54:11.181
CONSISTENTLY BECAUSE THEN WHEN

00:54:11.247 --> 00:54:12.449
YOU MEASURE YOU CAN GET A TRUE.

00:54:12.515 --> 00:54:15.051
ARE TRUE IDEA OF HOW SUCCESSFUL --

00:54:15.118 --> 00:54:16.886
THE PROGRAMS ARE AND MAKE.

00:54:16.953 --> 00:54:18.221
INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT WHERE

00:54:18.288 --> 00:54:19.556
TO CONTINUE TO INVEST FUNDS OR

00:54:19.623 --> 00:54:21.224
WHERE TO PERHAPS PULL FUNDS BACK

00:54:21.291 --> 00:54:22.859
AND AND SHIFT TO THE MORE

00:54:22.926 --> 00:54:24.661
SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS BUT THAT

00:54:24.728 --> 00:54:26.763
NEEDS TO HAPPEN -- UC IRVINE

00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:28.365
ACTUALLY PROVIDED A REPORT TO

00:54:28.431 --> 00:54:30.266
THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS IN

00:54:30.333 --> 00:54:32.502
JUNE OF EIGHTEEN AT WEST

00:54:32.569 --> 00:54:33.603
BASICALLY CAME UP WITH A

00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:35.672
CHECKLIST AND A WAY FOR

00:54:35.739 --> 00:54:37.107
CORRECTIONS TO IDENTIFY.

00:54:37.173 --> 00:54:39.442
THE CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE BOARD

00:54:39.509 --> 00:54:41.177
AND THAT PROGRAM FIDELITY WHEN

00:54:41.244 --> 00:54:43.046
CORRECTIONS -- TALK TO US ABOUT

00:54:43.113 --> 00:54:44.681
THAT WE QUESTION THEM ABOUT THE

00:54:44.748 --> 00:54:46.716
IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT.

00:54:46.783 --> 00:54:48.151
THEY ASSERTED TO US THAT THEY'RE

00:54:48.218 --> 00:54:49.119
NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO DO THAT

00:54:49.185 --> 00:54:50.553
UNTIL THE BEGINNING OF THIS NEXT

00:54:50.620 --> 00:54:55.759
FISCAL YEAR A NINETEEN BY JULY

00:54:55.825 --> 00:54:57.460
OF OF NINETEEN LATER THIS YEAR --

00:54:57.527 --> 00:54:58.595
THEY'VE HAD THE REPORT AS I SAID

00:54:58.662 --> 00:54:59.362
FROM IRVINE.

00:54:59.429 --> 00:55:01.631
AS AS FAR BACK AS JUNE OF TWENTY

00:55:01.698 --> 00:55:03.033
EIGHTEEN SO AGAIN A LITTLE BIT

00:55:03.099 --> 00:55:04.768
OF CONCERN THERE WHERE WE NEED

00:55:04.834 --> 00:55:06.403
TO BE MAKING BETTER PROGRESS

00:55:06.469 --> 00:55:08.204
STRONGER PROGRESS IN SOME OF

00:55:08.271 --> 00:55:09.339
THESE AREAS.

00:55:09.406 --> 00:55:11.307
ON THE LAST COUPLE OF ISSUES

00:55:11.374 --> 00:55:12.742
WITH RESPECT TO PROGRAMS IS

00:55:12.809 --> 00:55:15.245
FALLEN VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS AND A

00:55:15.311 --> 00:55:16.780
LOT OF THESE DO GET ATTENTION.

00:55:16.846 --> 00:55:17.847
CERTAINLY FROM THE MEDIA BECAUSE

00:55:17.914 --> 00:55:18.948
THEY'RE DIFFERENT TYPES OF

00:55:19.015 --> 00:55:21.017
PROGRAMS AS FAR AS A HORSE

00:55:21.084 --> 00:55:22.218
THERAPY IN THOSE SORTS OF THINGS

00:55:22.285 --> 00:55:24.120
THEY HAVE A HUGE NUMBER OF THESE

00:55:24.187 --> 00:55:26.790
PROGRAMS -- THAT CAN BE VERY

00:55:26.856 --> 00:55:29.259
BENEFICIAL AGAIN THE PROBLEM IS

00:55:29.325 --> 00:55:30.226
THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS

00:55:30.293 --> 00:55:32.095
HAS NOT ASSESSED THE THE SUCCESS

00:55:32.162 --> 00:55:33.329
OF THESE PROGRAMS THERE ARE A

00:55:33.396 --> 00:55:34.497
LOT OF INDIVIDUALS ARE

00:55:34.564 --> 00:55:35.832
INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING IN

00:55:35.899 --> 00:55:37.300
THESE PROGRAMS.

00:55:37.367 --> 00:55:39.436
CERTAINLY BECAUSE PART OF THE

00:55:39.502 --> 00:55:41.071
BENEFIT TO THEM IS SOME OF THEIR

00:55:41.137 --> 00:55:42.472
SENTENCES REDUCED IF THEY THEY

00:55:42.539 --> 00:55:44.007
PARTICIPATE IN COMPLETE SOME OF

00:55:44.074 --> 00:55:45.575
THESE VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS.

00:55:45.642 --> 00:55:48.378
BUT THE IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN

00:55:48.445 --> 00:55:49.112
CORRECTIONS.

00:55:49.179 --> 00:55:50.346
INVESTED ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS

00:55:50.413 --> 00:55:51.881
IN THESE PROGRAMS HAD ON AVERAGE

00:55:51.948 --> 00:55:53.316
ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND INMATES

00:55:53.383 --> 00:55:54.784
PARTICIPATING IN THESE PROGRAMS

00:55:54.851 --> 00:55:56.352
WHERE THEY FELL SHORT IS THEY

00:55:56.419 --> 00:55:57.387
HAVEN'T ASSESSED THESE

00:55:57.454 --> 00:55:58.922
PARTICULAR PROGRAMS HOW

00:55:58.988 --> 00:56:01.257
SUCCESSFUL HAVE THEY BEEN -- IN

00:56:01.324 --> 00:56:03.126
AND HELPING INMATES WITH ANGER

00:56:03.193 --> 00:56:04.761
MANAGEMENT WITH OTHER TYPES OF

00:56:04.828 --> 00:56:06.362
OUR CHARACTERISTICS THAT THEY

00:56:06.429 --> 00:56:08.598
NEED TO WORK ON TO MAKE THEM --

00:56:08.665 --> 00:56:09.999
MORE SUCCESSFUL WHEN THEY ARE

00:56:10.066 --> 00:56:11.901
RELEASED FROM PRISON --

00:56:11.968 --> 00:56:13.236
CORRECTIONS DID.

00:56:13.303 --> 00:56:14.704
INFORM US THAT THEY INTENDED TO

00:56:14.771 --> 00:56:16.806
PARTNER WITH PP I SEE BUT AGAIN

00:56:16.873 --> 00:56:18.108
WHEN WE FINISHED OUR FIELD WORK

00:56:18.174 --> 00:56:19.542
ON IT LATE LAST YEAR IN NOVEMBER

00:56:19.609 --> 00:56:21.277
DECEMBER AT THAT POINT THEY

00:56:21.344 --> 00:56:22.679
HADN'T REACHED ANY AGREEMENT

00:56:22.746 --> 00:56:24.214
WITH PP I SEE RELATED TO THE

00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:25.582
SCOPE OF THE REVIEW.

00:56:25.648 --> 00:56:26.416
HOW THEY WOULD GO ABOUT

00:56:26.483 --> 00:56:27.717
REVIEWING THESE VOLUNTEER

00:56:27.784 --> 00:56:28.718
PROGRAMS AND WE THINK IT'S

00:56:28.785 --> 00:56:29.819
REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT THAT

00:56:29.886 --> 00:56:31.087
THOSE PROGRAMS BE ASSESSED AS

00:56:31.154 --> 00:56:32.155
WELL AS?

00:56:32.222 --> 00:56:33.957
THE EVIDENCE BASED OTHER TYPES

00:56:34.023 --> 00:56:34.457
OF PROGRAMS BECAUSE IN

00:56:34.524 --> 00:56:36.493
CONJUNCTION THEY COULD BE VERY

00:56:36.559 --> 00:56:38.161
BENEFICIAL TO INMATES.

00:56:38.228 --> 00:56:40.330
IN THE VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS.

00:56:40.396 --> 00:56:41.865
AND THEN THE LAST PIECE IS

00:56:41.931 --> 00:56:43.533
LOOKING WE LOOKED AT SEE ROB --

00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:44.367
WHICH I'M SURE YOU'RE ALL

00:56:44.434 --> 00:56:45.401
FAMILIAR WITH THAT

00:56:45.468 --> 00:56:47.103
REHABILITATIVE OVERSIGHT BOARD

00:56:47.170 --> 00:56:48.171
THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR

00:56:48.238 --> 00:56:49.706
GENERAL AND THE BENEFITS THAT

00:56:49.773 --> 00:56:51.508
THEY COULD PROVIDE -- IN

00:56:51.574 --> 00:56:53.042
MONITORING REHAB PROGRAM

00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:54.711
PERFORMANCE REQUIRING

00:56:54.778 --> 00:56:55.745
CORRECTIONS TO REPORT BACK TO

00:56:55.812 --> 00:56:57.714
THEM OVERSEEING AN EXTERNAL

00:56:57.781 --> 00:56:59.516
RESEARCHER AT WE TALK ABOUT IN

00:56:59.582 --> 00:57:01.417
OUR RECOMMENDATIONS -- BECAUSE

00:57:01.484 --> 00:57:03.386
THEY DO HAVE THAT RESPONSIBILITY

00:57:03.453 --> 00:57:04.487
AND WE THINK THAT COULD PLAY A

00:57:04.554 --> 00:57:06.055
VERY VERY IMPORTANT ROLE.

00:57:06.122 --> 00:57:08.124
IN ASSESSING THE SUCCESS OF

00:57:08.191 --> 00:57:09.192
THESE PARTICULAR PROGRAMS AND

00:57:09.259 --> 00:57:10.794
THE PROGRESS THAT CORRECTIONS

00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:12.829
HAS OR HAS NOT MADE -- AS WE

00:57:12.896 --> 00:57:13.997
MOVE FORWARD.

00:57:14.063 --> 00:57:15.498
IN IN HOPEFULLY IMPLEMENTING

00:57:15.565 --> 00:57:16.699
SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE

00:57:16.766 --> 00:57:18.101
MADE IN THE REPORT AND IMPROVING

00:57:18.168 --> 00:57:20.270
THE THE REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS

00:57:20.336 --> 00:57:21.671
IN OUR INSTITUTIONS.

00:57:21.738 --> 00:57:23.206
SO WITH THAT MEMBERS I WILL TURN

00:57:23.273 --> 00:57:24.674
IT OVER TO MR FELDER AND HE'LL

00:57:24.741 --> 00:57:26.109
GO THROUGH -- THAT THE

00:57:26.176 --> 00:57:27.577
CATEGORIES OF RECOMMENDATIONS

00:57:27.644 --> 00:57:31.414
THAT WE MADE WE DID TALK ABOUT A

00:57:31.481 --> 00:57:32.649
THREE YEAR PLAN.

THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON --

00:57:41.991 --> 00:57:43.459
OF THE FOURTEEN RECOMMENDATIONS

00:57:43.526 --> 00:57:45.628
DIRECTED THE CDC ARE IT IS STILL

00:57:45.695 --> 00:57:46.796
IN THE PLANNING STAGES FOR

00:57:46.863 --> 00:57:48.698
IMPLEMENTING THIRTEEN OF THOSE

00:57:48.765 --> 00:57:50.967
AND HAS PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED.

00:57:51.034 --> 00:57:52.001
ONE SO SPECIFICALLY WE

00:57:52.068 --> 00:57:53.403
RECOMMENDED THAT CDC ARE RE

00:57:53.469 --> 00:57:55.405
VALIDATE COMPASS AND CS ARE A

00:57:55.471 --> 00:57:57.073
THAT IS THE MEASURE THAT

00:57:57.140 --> 00:57:57.507
MEASURES AND INMATES

00:57:57.574 --> 00:58:00.043
REHABILITATIVE NEEDS AS WELL AS

00:58:00.109 --> 00:58:01.611
THEIR RISK -- IT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:58:01.678 --> 00:58:02.579
KEEP THESE TOOLS ACCURATE

00:58:02.645 --> 00:58:03.479
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU NEED TO

00:58:03.546 --> 00:58:05.615
ASSESS THE CORRECTLY BUT ALSO

00:58:05.682 --> 00:58:07.483
ANY TIME THE INMATE DEMOGRAPHICS

00:58:07.550 --> 00:58:09.185
CHANGE THOSE TOOLS COULD BECOME

00:58:09.252 --> 00:58:10.753
AN ACCURATE AND WE'VE SEEN A BIG

00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:12.188
CHANGE IN THE WAY POPULATION

00:58:12.255 --> 00:58:15.325
SINCE REALIGNMENT -- FOR EXAMPLE --

00:58:15.391 --> 00:58:17.527
IN TWENTY TEN FOR CRIMES AGAINST

00:58:17.594 --> 00:58:19.362
PEOPLE'S THE NUMBER OF INMATES

00:58:19.429 --> 00:58:20.463
CONVICTED OF THOSE CRIMES IN A

00:58:20.530 --> 00:58:22.465
AND INSTITUTIONALIZED WAS 56% OF

00:58:22.532 --> 00:58:23.967
THE POPULATION.

00:58:24.033 --> 00:58:25.902
NOW IT'S SEVENTY NINE SO YOU SEE

00:58:25.969 --> 00:58:27.570
A BIG JOB THAT MEANS YOU NEED TO

00:58:27.637 --> 00:58:29.706
MAKE SURE THESE TOOLS ARE STILL

00:58:29.772 --> 00:58:31.174
ACCURATELY ASSESSING INMATES.

00:58:31.241 --> 00:58:32.976
CCIR HAS A TEAM WORKING ON A

00:58:33.042 --> 00:58:34.811
SCHEDULE AND IS RE ABOUT TO

00:58:34.878 --> 00:58:36.679
RETALIATE THE TOOLS AND THAT

00:58:36.746 --> 00:58:39.115
SCHEDULE SHOULD BE AVAILABLE

00:58:39.182 --> 00:58:40.416
SOMETIME THIS MONTH.

00:58:40.483 --> 00:58:41.517
SO OTHER MAKING PROGRESS THERE

AT LEAST TO GET A SCHEDULE GOING

00:58:42.418 --> 00:58:44.487
FOR THAT RETALIATION WE ALSO

00:58:44.554 --> 00:58:45.955
RECOMMENDED THAT CDC ARE AMEND

00:58:46.022 --> 00:58:47.023
ITS CONTRACTS TO ENSURE THE

00:58:47.090 --> 00:58:49.692
VENDORS WERE ONLY USING --

00:58:49.759 --> 00:58:51.361
EVIDENCE BASED FOR THEIR CBT I

00:58:51.427 --> 00:58:52.695
CURRICULA.

00:58:52.762 --> 00:58:55.498
AS DESIGNATED BY PEW -- CDC ARE

00:58:55.565 --> 00:58:56.866
HAS.

00:58:56.933 --> 00:58:59.469
SO FAR RIDE REVISED ITS TEMPLATE

00:58:59.535 --> 00:59:00.503
FOR THE CONTRACT FOR THE SCOPE

00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:02.372
OF WORK TO MANDATE ONLY EVIDENCE

00:59:02.438 --> 00:59:04.007
BASED CURRICULUM

00:59:04.073 --> 00:59:05.508
NOW THAT SHOULD BE IN YOU

00:59:05.575 --> 00:59:07.176
SOMETIME NEXT MONTH AND THAT'LL

00:59:07.243 --> 00:59:09.245
BE USED AN ONGOING BASIS SO

00:59:09.312 --> 00:59:10.546
ANYTIME THEY NEED TO MAKE TO

00:59:10.613 --> 00:59:11.648
CONTRACTS WITH THE VENDORS.

00:59:11.714 --> 00:59:12.749
NOW THEIR RESPONSE DID NOT

00:59:12.815 --> 00:59:14.150
INCLUDE ANY MENTION OF ANY

00:59:14.217 --> 00:59:15.351
OVERSIGHT MECHANISM SO HOW

00:59:15.418 --> 00:59:16.886
THEY'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY ENSURE

00:59:16.953 --> 00:59:17.520
THAT.

00:59:17.587 --> 00:59:19.155
THESE EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES

00:59:19.222 --> 00:59:21.291
ARE EVIDENCE BASED CRIGLER USED

00:59:21.357 --> 00:59:22.225
SO WE'RE STILL WAITING ON THAT.

00:59:22.292 --> 00:59:23.593
IN ADDITION WE RECOMMENDED THAT

00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:24.794
A PRIORITIZE INMATES

00:59:24.861 --> 00:59:27.297
APPROPRIATELY AND IT UPDATE IT'S

00:59:27.363 --> 00:59:29.499
WAIT LIST SYSTEM -- THIS MONTH

00:59:29.565 --> 00:59:30.767
CDC OR IS PLANNING ON

00:59:30.833 --> 00:59:31.935
IMPLEMENTING A WEIGHTLESS SYSTEM

00:59:32.001 --> 00:59:33.670
THAT PRIORITIZES INMATES BASED

00:59:33.736 --> 00:59:34.904
ON THE REHABILITATIVE NEEDS AND

00:59:34.971 --> 00:59:38.041
RISKS SO ONCE WE SEE THAT AND

00:59:38.107 --> 00:59:39.509
THEN THE SIX MONTH.

00:59:39.575 --> 00:59:41.544
RESPONSE PERIOD IN JULY WILL

00:59:41.611 --> 00:59:43.146
HOPEFULLY GET SOME EVIDENCE THAT

00:59:43.212 --> 00:59:44.580
IN FACT THAT NEW WEIGHTLESS

00:59:44.647 --> 00:59:47.183
SYSTEM IS ACTUALLY SHOWING A

00:59:47.250 --> 00:59:50.820
COMPASS AND CS SORRY SCORES.

00:59:50.887 --> 00:59:51.621
AND THEN ACTUALLY SLIDING

00:59:51.688 --> 00:59:52.588
INMATES NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE

00:59:52.655 --> 00:59:53.656
ON A SIGN FOR BECAUSE THEY HAVE

00:59:53.723 --> 00:59:55.825
HIGH NEED TO THE RISKS -- IS

00:59:55.892 --> 00:59:56.726

CORRECTIONAL COUNSELORS THOSE

01:00:01.497 --> 01:00:03.232
THE ONES THAT ACTUALLY ASSIGN

THE INMATES INTO THE PROGRAMS --

01:00:05.001 --> 01:00:06.269
WE RECOMMENDED THAT CDC OUR

STAKEHOLDERS.

01:00:43.673 --> 01:00:45.441
EARLIER SO WE COULD SEE EXACTLY

01:00:45.508 --> 01:00:46.676
WHAT -- WHAT THAT WORK WITH A

01:00:46.743 --> 01:00:48.611
TAIL BEFORE ANY CONTRACT IS

01:00:48.678 --> 01:00:50.213
FINALIZED?

01:00:50.279 --> 01:00:52.081
NOW -- THERE ARE SOME AREAS

01:00:52.148 --> 01:00:53.683
WHERE WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY

01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:55.585
NOTABLE PROGRESS -- FOR EXAMPLE

01:00:55.651 --> 01:00:57.854
WE RECOMMENDED THAT CDC OR

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:58.855
CREATE A PLAN TO MEET ITS

01:00:58.921 --> 01:01:01.858
STAFFING GOALS AND MONITOR THOSE --

01:01:01.924 --> 01:01:04.394
EFFORTS NOW CDC ARE DOES HAVE

01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:06.095
MECHANISMS TO MONITOR THE

01:01:06.162 --> 01:01:07.397
VACANCY RATES OF ITS STAFF AND

01:01:07.463 --> 01:01:08.865
ALL OF ITS INSTITUTIONS ON A

01:01:08.931 --> 01:01:10.566
MONTHLY BASIS THAT'S GOOD.

01:01:10.633 --> 01:01:12.468
BUT IT STILL HAS A YET TO

01:01:12.535 --> 01:01:14.303
DEVELOP ANY PLAN TO ENSURE THAT

01:01:14.370 --> 01:01:15.271
IT MEETS THOSE STAFFING GOALS

01:01:15.338 --> 01:01:17.240
ESPECIALLY INSTITUTIONS WHERE

01:01:17.306 --> 01:01:18.107
THEY'VE HAD VACANCIES IN

01:01:18.174 --> 01:01:20.977
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION FOR YEARS.

01:01:21.044 --> 01:01:23.212
AND THE OF THESE ARE THE SPOTS

01:01:23.279 --> 01:01:25.014
ARE SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO FILL

01:01:25.081 --> 01:01:26.249
BECAUSE OF THE GEOGRAPHY WORTH

01:01:26.315 --> 01:01:28.117
PRISONS LOCATED SO DOES GOING TO

01:01:28.184 --> 01:01:29.118
TAKE A LITTLE EXTRA ATTENTION

01:01:29.185 --> 01:01:31.354
AND ON CORRECTIONS BEHALF

01:01:31.421 --> 01:01:32.655
ACTUALLY GET PEOPLE IN THERE.

01:01:32.722 --> 01:01:33.823
AND SO WE'D LIKE TO SEE THAT

01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:35.491
PLAN DEVELOPED.

01:01:35.558 --> 01:01:36.959
IN ADDITION CDC OURS YET TO

01:01:37.026 --> 01:01:38.394
DEVELOP ANY PROGRAM TARGETS OR

01:01:38.461 --> 01:01:40.096
METRICS FOR ITS REBUILT ASIAN

01:01:40.163 --> 01:01:41.030
PROGRAMS.

01:01:41.097 --> 01:01:42.231
THAT THOSE WOULD INCLUDE SAY THE

01:01:42.298 --> 01:01:43.332
YOU KNOW THE PERCENTAGE OF

01:01:43.399 --> 01:01:44.567
INMATES AND ROLLED AND

01:01:44.634 --> 01:01:45.601
REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS THE

01:01:45.668 --> 01:01:47.070
PERCENTAGE THE COMPLETE WE'D

01:01:47.136 --> 01:01:48.438
LIKE TO SEE WHAT YOU KNOW WHERE

01:01:48.504 --> 01:01:49.839
WE'RE TO SEE TO SEE I THINK THAT.

01:01:49.906 --> 01:01:51.841
THAT NUMBER SHOULD BE AS WELL AS

01:01:51.908 --> 01:01:54.544
YOU KNOW EVENTUALLY WITH THE HOW

01:01:54.610 --> 01:01:55.978
WELL THESE PROGRAMS ARE ACTUALLY

01:01:56.045 --> 01:01:57.447
REDUCING RECIDIVISM.

01:01:57.513 --> 01:01:59.048
AND SETTING GOALS THERE.

01:01:59.115 --> 01:02:01.384
FINALLY -- ONE REASON IN ME TO

01:02:01.451 --> 01:02:02.251
ROLL MADE.

01:02:02.318 --> 01:02:04.020
IN THESE CLASSES WAS LOW --

01:02:04.087 --> 01:02:07.457
CITIES ARE IDENTIFIED AS SPACE

01:02:07.523 --> 01:02:08.191
LIMITATIONS.

01:02:08.257 --> 01:02:09.358
SO -- WE RECOMMENDED THAT CDC

01:02:09.425 --> 01:02:10.927
ARE PREPARE REPORT ON ITS

01:02:10.993 --> 01:02:12.595
CURRENT SPACE YOU KNOW WHAT WAIT

01:02:12.662 --> 01:02:14.063
WHERE DID IT NEED TO ADD MORE

01:02:14.130 --> 01:02:15.698
AND HOW MUCH WOULD THAT COST TO

01:02:15.765 --> 01:02:17.133
PRESENT TO THE LEGISLATURE.

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:18.835
CDC ARE STATED THAT IT WOULD NOT

01:02:18.901 --> 01:02:20.169
HAVE A FUNDING REQUEST READY

01:02:20.236 --> 01:02:23.272
UNTIL FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY

01:02:23.339 --> 01:02:24.040
ONE TWENTY TWO SETS OVER THREE

01:02:24.107 --> 01:02:26.476
AND A HALF YEARS FROM NOW -- WE

01:02:26.542 --> 01:02:28.344
THINK THAT THEY CAN SB THAT UP A

01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:29.912
LOT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE NOT

01:02:29.979 --> 01:02:31.214
GOING TO GET THESE IN ROMAN

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:32.949
NUMBERS AT THE MAXIMUM BUDGET

01:02:33.015 --> 01:02:34.383
CAPACITY UNLESS YOU HAVE THE

01:02:34.450 --> 01:02:36.018
SPACE FOR IT SO THE SOONER YOU

01:02:36.085 --> 01:02:37.587
GET THAT SPACE THE SOONER YOU

01:02:37.653 --> 01:02:38.988
CAN ACTUALLY GET MORE.

01:02:39.055 --> 01:02:41.324
INMATES WHO NEED THAT --

01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:42.892
RESULTED OF PROGRAMMING.

01:02:42.959 --> 01:02:45.027
AND WELL WE'LL BE FOLLOWING UP

01:02:45.094 --> 01:02:47.330
WITH CDC ARE AT SIX MONTH AND

01:02:47.396 --> 01:02:48.798
ONE YEAR FROM REPORT ISSUANCE.

01:02:48.865 --> 01:02:50.666
AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

01:02:50.733 --> 01:02:51.300
QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE AT THIS

01:02:51.367 --> 01:02:53.903
TIME.

01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:54.804
THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT

01:02:54.871 --> 01:02:56.239
APPRECIATE THAT OVERVIEW I THINK

01:02:56.305 --> 01:02:57.340
THERE WAS A LOT IN THERE AND

01:02:57.406 --> 01:02:58.808
THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS FOR

01:02:58.875 --> 01:02:59.909
THE NEXT PANEL.

01:02:59.976 --> 01:03:01.611
BASED OFF OF YOUR INFORMATION

01:03:01.677 --> 01:03:05.414
BUT LET ME JUST ASK A GENERAL

01:03:05.481 --> 01:03:07.049
FIRST QUESTION MAYBE YOU KNOW

01:03:07.116 --> 01:03:08.618
BECAUS WE READ THE HEADLINES

01:03:08.684 --> 01:03:10.820
AND YOU MENTIONED -- MADAM

01:03:10.887 --> 01:03:13.055
AUDITOR THE THE HEADLINES THAT

01:03:13.122 --> 01:03:13.890
WE'VE BEEN READING OUT IN THE

01:03:13.956 --> 01:03:15.391
MEDIA ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES

01:03:15.458 --> 01:03:16.993
TO CORRECTIONS ON WHETHER OR NOT

01:03:17.059 --> 01:03:21.597
THEY ARE BEING EFFECTIVE -- THAT

01:03:21.664 --> 01:03:23.299
A FAIR ASSESSMENT IN YOUR VIEW

01:03:23.366 --> 01:03:24.600
BECAUSE I THINK YOU POINTED OUT

01:03:24.667 --> 01:03:26.102
SOME OF THE PROGRAMS AND SOME OF

01:03:26.169 --> 01:03:26.669
THE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE

01:03:26.736 --> 01:03:28.337
LOOKED AT BUT YOU KNOW I ALSO

01:03:28.404 --> 01:03:30.206
LOOKED AT THE AUDITED I FOUND

01:03:30.273 --> 01:03:31.007
THINGS LIKE FOR INSTANCE

01:03:31.073 --> 01:03:34.310
SATISFIED IN CORCORAN IN MY AREA.

01:03:34.377 --> 01:03:36.612
SEEM TO BE DO AND AN OKAY JOB IN

01:03:36.679 --> 01:03:37.947
TERMS OF THE ACTUAL RECIDIVISM.

01:03:38.014 --> 01:03:39.615
I MEAN CAN YOU TALK TO THE

01:03:39.682 --> 01:03:40.983
PARENTS OF WHICH PROGRAMS THAT

01:03:41.050 --> 01:03:42.585
YOU SOLVE PROBABLY ARE WORKING

01:03:42.652 --> 01:03:43.786
BUT THEN MAYBE WE ASK QUESTION

01:03:43.853 --> 01:03:44.987
WHY AREN'T THOSE BEING

01:03:45.054 --> 01:03:46.055
REPLICATED EVEN IF.

01:03:46.122 --> 01:03:47.256
IT'S ALREADY IN THE SYSTEM AND

01:03:47.323 --> 01:03:48.257
SOMETHING THAT'S ACTUALLY

01:03:48.324 --> 01:03:49.959
WORKING COMPARED TO SOME OF

01:03:50.026 --> 01:03:50.893
THESE OTHERS WHERE THEY DON'T

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.295
HAVE THE METRICS OF THE

01:03:52.361 --> 01:03:53.796
ANALYTICS TO ACTUALLY SHOW.

01:03:53.863 --> 01:03:57.166
ANY PROGRESSION OR TOWARDS

01:03:57.233 --> 01:03:58.734
REDUCING THE RECIDIVISM RATE.

01:03:58.801 --> 01:04:00.102
WELL I I THINK I'D LIKE TO

01:04:00.169 --> 01:04:01.537
ADDRESS AT A FIRST PLEASE THAT'S

01:04:01.604 --> 01:04:02.905
THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT

01:04:02.972 --> 01:04:04.473
FACILITY.

01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:06.442
AND YOU THAT WAS NOT ONE OF THE

01:04:06.509 --> 01:04:08.144
PRISONS WHERE WE CONDUCTED AN IN

01:04:08.211 --> 01:04:09.145
DEPTH REVIEW THAT WAS ENERGY DOT

01:04:09.212 --> 01:04:10.846
OF IN SYNC WONDERFUL SOME BUT WE

01:04:10.913 --> 01:04:12.215
DID HAVE A CHANCE TO SPEAK WITH

01:04:12.281 --> 01:04:14.650
THE ADMINISTRATOR THERE -- AND

01:04:14.717 --> 01:04:17.053
HE INDICATED THAT THAT SEVERAL

01:04:17.119 --> 01:04:18.754
THINGS KIND OF SET THAT PROGRAM

01:04:18.821 --> 01:04:20.256
APART FROM OTHER FACILITIES AT

01:04:20.323 --> 01:04:22.525
CDC OURS PRISONS SPECIFICALLY --

01:04:22.592 --> 01:04:24.026
THEY OFFERED INCENTIVE PROGRAM

01:04:24.093 --> 01:04:25.928
SO IF YOU STATE ON TRACK WITH

01:04:25.995 --> 01:04:27.630
YOUR PROGRAMMING -- YOU THERE

01:04:27.697 --> 01:04:28.864
WERE INCENTIVES IN IN MAY COULD

01:04:28.931 --> 01:04:30.800
RECEIVE SUCH AS HAVING AS SOLO

01:04:30.866 --> 01:04:34.270
SELL -- AND IN ADDITION -- HE

01:04:34.337 --> 01:04:35.137
INDICATED THERE WAS KIND OF

01:04:35.204 --> 01:04:36.772
IMMERSIVE CBT ENVIRONMENT WHERE

01:04:36.839 --> 01:04:38.307
YOU WERE HOUSED WITH PEOPLE ALL

01:04:38.374 --> 01:04:39.742
TAKEN THE SAME COURSES AT THE

01:04:39.809 --> 01:04:40.776
SAME TIME.

01:04:40.843 --> 01:04:41.877
AND THAT REALLY THAT WAS MUCH

01:04:41.944 --> 01:04:43.980
MORE CONDUCIVE -- TO HAVING MORE

01:04:44.046 --> 01:04:48.651
INMATES COMPLETE THE PROGRAM --

01:04:48.718 --> 01:04:50.653
WITH WHATEVER THE PROGRAM A. B. --

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:51.287
HOWEVER IF YOU NEED MORE DETAILS

01:04:51.354 --> 01:04:52.822
ON CAN THE PAST OR CURRENT

01:04:52.888 --> 01:04:54.257
PRACTICES AT SAD IF I'M SURE

01:04:54.323 --> 01:04:55.358
CITIES HERE CAN PROVIDE YOU MORE

01:04:55.424 --> 01:04:58.995
DETAILED INFORMATION ON THAT --

01:04:59.061 --> 01:05:00.296
AND I I SHE TO THE SECOND PART

01:05:00.363 --> 01:05:01.464
YOUR QUESTION RELATED TO THE

01:05:01.530 --> 01:05:03.132
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAMS

01:05:03.199 --> 01:05:04.600
AND BY.

01:05:04.667 --> 01:05:06.335
SO WHAT WE DID FIND WAS THAT.

01:05:06.402 --> 01:05:08.004
WE FOCUSED ON C. B. T. BECAUSE

01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:09.605
ITS THE NEWEST SUITE OF

01:05:09.672 --> 01:05:10.773
PROGRAMMING OFFERED BY

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:12.508
CORRECTIONS AND ALSO THAT.

01:05:12.575 --> 01:05:15.144
YOU KNOW 70% OF THE BUDGET AND

01:05:15.211 --> 01:05:15.778
SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN WHEN THEY DID

01:05:15.845 --> 01:05:17.046
MAKE THAT BIG EXPANSIVE EFFORT

01:05:17.113 --> 01:05:18.314
TO INCREASE REHABILITATIVE

01:05:18.381 --> 01:05:19.749
PROGRAMMING 70% OF THAT WAS

01:05:19.815 --> 01:05:20.883
TARGETED CBT.

01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:22.418
SO IT ME ALTHOUGH IT MAKES UP

01:05:22.485 --> 01:05:25.288
ONLY ABOUT 25% OF THE INMATES --

01:05:25.354 --> 01:05:26.389
AVAILABLE SLOTS FOR

01:05:26.455 --> 01:05:28.157
REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING WE

01:05:28.224 --> 01:05:29.892
FELT THAT THAT WAS THE HIGHEST

01:05:29.959 --> 01:05:31.394
RISK POPULATION TO GO AFTER.

01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:33.562
AND YOU KNOW ALTHOUGH OUR

01:05:33.629 --> 01:05:35.331
PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS FOUND THAT

01:05:35.398 --> 01:05:36.932
WILL THAN TWO YEARS RECIDIVISM

01:05:36.999 --> 01:05:38.768
REALLY DIDN'T CHANGE THAT MUCH.

01:05:38.834 --> 01:05:40.102
FOR US TO DRIVE TRIGGERED YOU

01:05:40.169 --> 01:05:42.138
KNOW -- KIND OF A TWO FOLD IDEA

01:05:42.204 --> 01:05:43.372
THAT ONE THERE NEEDS TO BE A

01:05:43.439 --> 01:05:45.007
MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS

01:05:45.074 --> 01:05:47.410
CONDUCTED. TO SEE OKAY WHAT IS

01:05:47.476 --> 01:05:48.644
WORKING WHAT ISN'T IMPROVE

01:05:48.711 --> 01:05:49.812
BETWEEN ALL THE PROGRAMS NOT

01:05:49.879 --> 01:05:51.681
JUST C. B. T. AND WITH THREE

01:05:51.747 --> 01:05:53.683
YEAR ANALYSIS OF ALL THREE

01:05:53.749 --> 01:05:56.786
DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF

01:05:56.852 --> 01:05:57.386
REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING --

01:05:57.453 --> 01:05:58.587
AND THEN YOU CAN START MAKING

01:05:58.654 --> 01:05:59.422
DECISIONS ON WHAT'S EFFECTIVE

01:05:59.488 --> 01:06:00.656
WHAT ISN'T BASED ON THAT

01:06:00.723 --> 01:06:02.491
ANALYSIS BECAUSE OURS OBVIOUSLY

01:06:02.558 --> 01:06:04.327
IS THE FLAG TO GOES UP THAT SAYS

01:06:04.393 --> 01:06:05.795
YOU NEED TO DO MORE WORK HERE.

01:06:05.861 --> 01:06:08.764
I THINK SECONDLY IT YOU KNOW IT

01:06:08.831 --> 01:06:09.932
SAYS THE CDC ARE THAT.

01:06:09.999 --> 01:06:12.568
THERE'S WAYS -- THAT YOU COULD

01:06:12.635 --> 01:06:14.070
ADMINISTER THESE PROGRAMS BETTER

01:06:14.136 --> 01:06:15.338
THAT IN FACT THE POOR

01:06:15.404 --> 01:06:16.706
MINISTRATION IS LIMITING THE

01:06:16.772 --> 01:06:18.074
EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE PROGRAMS

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:19.475
AND THAT WITH YOU KNOW --

01:06:19.542 --> 01:06:21.077
PRIORITIZING THE WEIGHTLESS

01:06:21.143 --> 01:06:23.746
ISSUE -- THE EVIDENCE BASED

01:06:23.813 --> 01:06:25.247
ISSUE OF YOU KNOW YOU FIX THESE

01:06:25.314 --> 01:06:26.649
YOU FIX THESE ADMINISTRATIVE

01:06:26.716 --> 01:06:28.718
AREAS YOU COULD SEE -- BETTER

01:06:28.784 --> 01:06:31.420
RESULTS.

01:06:31.487 --> 01:06:33.723
THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION.

01:06:33.789 --> 01:06:35.057
YES THANK YOU.

01:06:35.124 --> 01:06:36.025
LET ME OPEN IT UP LET ME ASK

01:06:36.092 --> 01:06:37.827
THERE'S ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS.

01:06:37.893 --> 01:06:38.994
MISTER JONES SAWYER.

01:06:39.061 --> 01:06:42.798
SO -- YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE -- WE

01:06:42.865 --> 01:06:43.833
PUT IN THIS CONTEXT IS THIS

01:06:43.899 --> 01:06:45.368
WHOLE DISCUSSION OF EVIDENCE

01:06:45.434 --> 01:06:47.937
BASED I KIND OF WANT TO GET YOUR

01:06:48.003 --> 01:06:50.139
YOUR DEFINITION OF IT -- BECAUSE

01:06:50.206 --> 01:06:53.008
WHEN I WHEN I SPEAK TO

01:06:53.075 --> 01:06:54.577
INDIVIDUALS AND I'LL GIVE AN

01:06:54.643 --> 01:06:56.879
EXAMPLE WHEN TIM ROBBINS CAME

01:06:56.946 --> 01:06:59.281
INTO MY OFFICE TO TALK ABOUT.

01:06:59.348 --> 01:07:01.550
THE THE ACTORS GANG.

01:07:01.617 --> 01:07:04.186
ANY HAD TO INDIVIDUALS -- WHO

01:07:04.253 --> 01:07:04.820
HAD GONE TO HIS PROGRAM

01:07:04.887 --> 01:07:05.121
[inaudible]

01:07:05.187 --> 01:07:08.424
AND ED NOT WE SHOULD HAVE AIDED

01:07:08.491 --> 01:07:09.525
IN A YEAR.

01:07:09.592 --> 01:07:11.060
ARMY LOOK ME STRAIGHT IN THE EYE

01:07:11.127 --> 01:07:13.362
AND SAID WE'RE NOT AN EVIDENCE

01:07:13.429 --> 01:07:13.562
BASED.

01:07:13.629 --> 01:07:15.231
PROGRAM.

01:07:15.297 --> 01:07:18.501
AND I'M I'M SITTING THERE GOING.

01:07:18.567 --> 01:07:20.336
I LOOK AT ONE PERSON HERE.

01:07:20.403 --> 01:07:21.871
L. ONE PERSON THERE.

01:07:21.937 --> 01:07:24.039
THAT WE NO LONGER HAVE TO SPEND

01:07:24.106 --> 01:07:24.640
EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS A

01:07:24.707 --> 01:07:25.541
YEAR.

01:07:25.608 --> 01:07:26.842
IN MY MIND.

01:07:26.909 --> 01:07:28.611
THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT WE JUST

01:07:28.677 --> 01:07:31.947
SAVE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:07:32.014 --> 01:07:32.481
HUNDRED SIXTY TWO THOUSAND

01:07:32.548 --> 01:07:34.583
DOLLARS A YEAR BECAUSE THESE TWO

01:07:34.650 --> 01:07:35.951
INDIVIDUALS DID NOT.

01:07:36.018 --> 01:07:38.788
WE SHOULD HAVE A BECAUSE OF THE

01:07:38.854 --> 01:07:40.289
WAY WE THINK OF BANKS.

01:07:40.356 --> 01:07:41.824
BY THE WAY WE CALCULATED A NO

01:07:41.891 --> 01:07:43.392
DISRESPECT TO THE AUDITOR'S

01:07:43.459 --> 01:07:45.961
OFFICE SORT OF FINANCE OR TO THE

01:07:46.028 --> 01:07:47.730
LA OWES IN THE OF THE WORLD ANY

01:07:47.797 --> 01:07:48.631
OTHER.

01:07:48.697 --> 01:07:51.467
PENCIL PUSHERS THEY HAVE A THEY

01:07:51.534 --> 01:07:53.235
HAVE A WAY OF LOOKING AT THINGS

01:07:53.302 --> 01:07:55.838
THAT MAY NOT HELP.

01:07:55.905 --> 01:07:57.773
US ACTUALLY.

01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:59.608
DO EVIDENCE BASED.

01:07:59.675 --> 01:08:01.177
AND THEN IT ALSO MEAN NO

01:08:01.243 --> 01:08:02.745
DISRESPECT TO ACADEMICS IS

01:08:02.812 --> 01:08:05.114
SPECIALLY UCI BUT THEY MAY HAVE

01:08:05.181 --> 01:08:06.715
SOME IDEA OF WHAT IT IS.

01:08:06.782 --> 01:08:11.153
BUT WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS.

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:12.955
YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GET THAT

01:08:13.022 --> 01:08:14.423
EVIDENCE BASED ON THE FRONT END

01:08:14.490 --> 01:08:15.591
BUT YOU MAY BE ABLE TO GET IT ON

01:08:15.658 --> 01:08:18.194
ON THE BACK IN THE SAME WAY WITH --

01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:20.029
THERE'S A PROGRAM [inaudible]

01:08:20.095 --> 01:08:26.168
THAT -- A MAJOR TRAINING --

01:08:26.235 --> 01:08:29.071
SERVICE DOGS SERVICE ANIMALS.

01:08:29.138 --> 01:08:30.339
AND THEN THEY GIVE OUT TO PEOPLE

01:08:30.406 --> 01:08:32.074
WHO NEED THEM.

01:08:32.141 --> 01:08:33.142
BUT THEY ALSO FOUND THAT

01:08:33.209 --> 01:08:34.643
INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN THAT

01:08:34.710 --> 01:08:36.745
PROGRAM -- THE NUMBER OF

01:08:36.812 --> 01:08:38.247
INCIDENTS THAT THEY'RE INVOLVED

01:08:38.314 --> 01:08:39.415
IN VIOLENCE.

01:08:39.482 --> 01:08:43.018
DRUG OFFENSES BEING ON DRUGS --

01:08:43.085 --> 01:08:45.554
HAVE GONE WAY DOWN AND I AND AND

01:08:45.621 --> 01:08:48.591
I AND I ASKED THE THE SECRETARY.

01:08:48.657 --> 01:08:49.992
WE KINDA HAD OF JUST A QUICK

01:08:50.059 --> 01:08:51.560
CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT AND HE

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:53.062
SAID YOU KNOW EVERY TIME WE

01:08:53.128 --> 01:08:56.365
WRITE A REPORT ABOUT AN INCIDENT.

01:08:56.432 --> 01:08:57.766
THAT'S LIKE A THOUSAND DOLLARS.

01:08:57.833 --> 01:09:00.803
AND IF THERE'S LIKE [inaudible]

01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:02.771
NINETEEN HUNDRED A YEAR.

01:09:02.838 --> 01:09:04.840
IN ONE FACILITY THAT'S ONE POINT

01:09:04.907 --> 01:09:06.242
NINE MILLION.

01:09:06.308 --> 01:09:07.910
IF YOU COULD REDUCE THAT DOWN

01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:08.978
SIGNIFICAN THAT'S ANOTHER

01:09:09.044 --> 01:09:10.613
SAVINGS AND THAT COULD BE

01:09:10.679 --> 01:09:12.581
SOMETHING YOU COULD USE TO SAY.

01:09:12.648 --> 01:09:14.016
YOU KNOW THIS PROGRAM WERE

01:09:14.083 --> 01:09:15.284
SOMEBODY THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE

01:09:15.351 --> 01:09:16.886
MORE HARD KNOWS ABOUT

01:09:16.952 --> 01:09:18.053
REHABILITATION.

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:20.122
THEY MAY LAUGH AT THAT PROGRAMS

01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:21.056
LIKE THAT.

01:09:21.123 --> 01:09:24.026
WE COULD ACTUALLY SHOW THAT IT

01:09:24.093 --> 01:09:25.995
WORKS BUT IT MAY NOT FIT IN HIS

01:09:26.061 --> 01:09:27.329
BOX.

01:09:27.396 --> 01:09:30.566
CALLED EVIDENCE BASED SO I KIND

01:09:30.633 --> 01:09:31.834
OF WANT TO GET YOUR TAKE.

01:09:31.901 --> 01:09:34.403
ON EVIDENCE BASED BECAUSE FOR ME.

01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:35.638
STOP IT IT COULD BE.

01:09:35.704 --> 01:09:37.706
IF WE ALL SAT IN REALLY THOUGHT

01:09:37.773 --> 01:09:40.576
ABOUT IT -- AND I MAYBE WE NEED

01:09:40.643 --> 01:09:42.344
TO ELIMINATE THIS TERM EVIDENCE

01:09:42.411 --> 01:09:43.679
BASE AND TALK ABOUT RETURN ON

01:09:43.746 --> 01:09:44.780
INVESTMENT.

01:09:44.847 --> 01:09:48.784
R. A WHY THAT MIGHT GET US. TO A

01:09:48.851 --> 01:09:51.987
BETTER PLACE OF OF OF GETTING

01:09:52.054 --> 01:09:53.889
MORE MONEY GETTING MORE.

01:09:53.956 --> 01:09:55.391
MORE SKEPTICAL MEMBERS IN THE

01:09:55.457 --> 01:09:59.828
ASSEMBLY -- INVOLVED IN THIS.

01:09:59.895 --> 01:10:01.163
SO FAR IT'S RESPOND I THINK THE

01:10:01.230 --> 01:10:02.464
BATTERY ME THE CLINICAL

01:10:02.531 --> 01:10:05.167
DEFINITION OF EVIDENCE BASED

01:10:05.234 --> 01:10:07.269
OKAY GOT IT.

01:10:07.336 --> 01:10:09.738
THAT'S ALL -- WE WE'VE GOT A

01:10:09.805 --> 01:10:11.073
WE'VE DIVIDED IS SIMPLY --

01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:12.074
PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN PROVEN

01:10:12.141 --> 01:10:13.776
THROUGH RESEARCH TO REDUCE

01:10:13.842 --> 01:10:15.411
RECIDIVISM BUT WE'RE ONLY

01:10:15.477 --> 01:10:16.946
SPEAKING TO THAT OF THE CVT

01:10:17.012 --> 01:10:18.647
PROGRAM SO THAT'S JUST FAMILY

01:10:18.714 --> 01:10:20.316
RELATIONSHIPS CRIMINOLOGICAL

01:10:20.382 --> 01:10:22.651
THINKING SUBSTANCE ABUSE -- AND

01:10:22.718 --> 01:10:25.354
ANGER MANAGEMENT SO THAT THAT'S

01:10:25.421 --> 01:10:25.921
KIND OF ITS BOX OVER HERE

01:10:25.988 --> 01:10:27.356
THERE'S THERE'S HUNDREDS AND

01:10:27.423 --> 01:10:29.224
THOUSANDS OF OTHER PROGRAMS THAT

01:10:29.291 --> 01:10:30.960
CDC ARE OFFERS THEIR VOLUNTEER

01:10:31.026 --> 01:10:34.530
PROGRAMS THAT NEED TO BE STUDIED

01:10:34.597 --> 01:10:34.797
AND THOSE.

01:10:34.863 --> 01:10:38.500
THE YOU KNOW IT ENTITIES -- IT

01:10:38.567 --> 01:10:39.101
OUTSIDE RESEARCH ORGANIZATION

01:10:39.168 --> 01:10:40.369
CAN KIND OF LOOK AT SOME OF

01:10:40.436 --> 01:10:43.439
THOSE -- IN QUALITY OR PROGRAMS

01:10:43.505 --> 01:10:45.574
AND SAY OKAY WE OF BASED ON THE

01:10:45.641 --> 01:10:47.242
EVEN A SMALL SAMPLE SIZE THIS

01:10:47.309 --> 01:10:48.577
THIS WORKS A COULD BE SHOULD BE

01:10:48.644 --> 01:10:50.613
EXPANDED TO OTHER INSTITUTIONS.

01:10:50.679 --> 01:10:51.814
WE THINK THAT THAT WORK SHOULD

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:53.182
BE DONE SO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY

01:10:53.248 --> 01:10:54.817
EVIDENCE BASED FOR EVERYBODY BUT

01:10:54.883 --> 01:10:56.485
WE DO THINK THAT YOU NEED TO

01:10:56.552 --> 01:10:58.554
LOOK AT YOU KNOW X. AMOUNT OF

01:10:58.621 --> 01:10:59.321
INDIVIDUALS WHO LEFT IN TAKEN

01:10:59.388 --> 01:11:00.422
THIS.

01:11:00.489 --> 01:11:03.158
PARTICULAR VOLUNTEER PROGRAM

01:11:03.225 --> 01:11:03.759
WOULD HAVE BEEN THE RESULTS OF

01:11:03.826 --> 01:11:04.693
THAT.

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:05.561
SO DON'T NECESSARILY EVIDENCE

01:11:05.628 --> 01:11:07.496
BASED BUT SIMPLY JUST -- YOU

01:11:07.563 --> 01:11:08.464
KNOW.

01:11:08.530 --> 01:11:10.599
AND I'M LOOKING AT THE OUTCOMES.

01:11:10.666 --> 01:11:12.034
RIGHT MISTER JONES ARE THE WAY

01:11:12.101 --> 01:11:13.569
AND I APPRECIATE AARON'S ANSWER

01:11:13.636 --> 01:11:15.638
I THINK WHAT WHAT YOU'RE GETTING

01:11:15.704 --> 01:11:16.739
AT IS.

01:11:16.805 --> 01:11:17.873
WE DON'T NEED JUST ONE

01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:19.508
PARTICULAR TYPE OF PROGRAM WHICH

01:11:19.575 --> 01:11:21.610
IS C. B. T. EVIDENCE BASE THERE

01:11:21.677 --> 01:11:22.645
ARE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT

01:11:22.711 --> 01:11:24.046
PROGRAMS THERE'S ACADEMIC

01:11:24.113 --> 01:11:25.648
THERE'S VOCATIONAL EDUCATION.

01:11:25.714 --> 01:11:27.316
AND THERE'S A VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS

01:11:27.383 --> 01:11:29.218
AND LET'S NOT JUST DISMISS THOSE

01:11:29.284 --> 01:11:30.686
OTHER PROGRAMS BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:11:30.753 --> 01:11:32.354
NOT EVIDENCE BASED WE WOULD

01:11:32.421 --> 01:11:34.456
ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH THAT AND

01:11:34.523 --> 01:11:35.090
THAT'S WHY WE DISCUSSED IN THE

01:11:35.157 --> 01:11:35.924
REPORT.

01:11:35.991 --> 01:11:37.660
BOTH ACADEMIC AND VOCATIONAL

01:11:37.726 --> 01:11:38.961
EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND THE

01:11:39.028 --> 01:11:40.996
ISSUES THERE WITH RESPECT TO

01:11:41.063 --> 01:11:42.665
THEY HAVE MORE BUDGET CAPACITY

01:11:42.731 --> 01:11:43.999
THEY MIGHT NEED TO HIRE MORE

01:11:44.066 --> 01:11:45.534
INDIVIDUALS TO PROVIDE THOSE

01:11:45.601 --> 01:11:47.302
TYPES OF THE ACADEMIC TRAINING

01:11:47.369 --> 01:11:49.371
FOR IT FOR INDIVIDUALS TO GET

01:11:49.438 --> 01:11:50.706
THEIR READING LEVEL UP AT CETERA.

01:11:50.773 --> 01:11:52.374
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION ALLOWED THE

01:11:52.441 --> 01:11:53.509
FOLK AT WORK THAT IS DONE AND

01:11:53.575 --> 01:11:55.911
CAL PA A IS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL.

01:11:55.978 --> 01:11:57.413
WHAT WE'RE SUGGESTING IS IF

01:11:57.479 --> 01:12:00.082
YOU'RE GOING TO USE CBT PROGRAMS

01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:01.850
THEY RESEARCH PROVES THAT THE

01:12:01.917 --> 01:12:03.585
EVIDENCE THE MOST EFFECTIVE CBT

01:12:03.652 --> 01:12:04.787
PROGRAMS ARE THOSE THAT ARE

01:12:04.853 --> 01:12:05.921
EVIDENCE BASED?

01:12:05.988 --> 01:12:07.156
THAT IS NOT TO SUGGEST THAT

01:12:07.222 --> 01:12:08.691
THESE VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS LIKE

01:12:08.757 --> 01:12:10.459
YOU SAID SERVICE DOGS WE TALK

01:12:10.526 --> 01:12:14.563
ABOUT HORSE THERAPY AND SOME

01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:15.464
PEOPLE MAY SAY OUT.

01:12:15.531 --> 01:12:16.065
YOU KNOW WHY ARE YOU PROVIDING

01:12:16.131 --> 01:12:16.565
THESE KINDS OF PROGRAMS

01:12:16.632 --> 01:12:18.200
INDIVIDUALS WELL IT IT'S LOOKING

01:12:18.267 --> 01:12:20.569
OUT OF THE INDIVIDUAL AN INMATE.

01:12:20.636 --> 01:12:22.705
FROM A HOLISTIC PERSPECTIVE AND

01:12:22.771 --> 01:12:23.906
IF A HORSE THERAPY PROGRAM IS

01:12:23.972 --> 01:12:25.374
GOING TO SUGGEST THAT INDIVIDUAL

01:12:25.441 --> 01:12:26.709
AND WE'VE EVALUATED AND

01:12:26.775 --> 01:12:29.244
DETERMINED THAT IT HAS BEEN

01:12:29.311 --> 01:12:31.013
SUCCESSFUL IN REDUCING --

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.481
INCIDENTS IN THE INSTITUTION

01:12:32.548 --> 01:12:34.516
ANGER MED ADDRESSED ANGER

01:12:34.583 --> 01:12:35.784
MANAGEMENT THOSE SORTS OF THINGS

01:12:35.851 --> 01:12:37.886
TEACHING DISCIPLINE ETCETERA

01:12:37.953 --> 01:12:40.422
LET'S CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THOSE

01:12:40.489 --> 01:12:41.724
PROGRAMS SO.

01:12:41.790 --> 01:12:43.525
I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO CONCLUDE

01:12:43.592 --> 01:12:44.960
FROM OUR REPORT THAT.

01:12:45.027 --> 01:12:46.395
THERE ARE PROGRAMS IN THE

01:12:46.462 --> 01:12:48.397
INSTITUTIONS THAT IF THEY'RE NOT

01:12:48.464 --> 01:12:49.164
EVIDENCE BASED THEY SHOULD BE

01:12:49.231 --> 01:12:50.766
TOSSED THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE

01:12:50.833 --> 01:12:52.868
SUGGESTING WE ARE SUGGESTING IF

01:12:52.935 --> 01:12:54.436
YOU'RE GONNA USE THESE COGNITIVE

01:12:54.503 --> 01:12:56.872
BEHAVIORAL TREATMENT PROGRAMS.

01:12:56.939 --> 01:12:58.874
THE RESEARCH SHOWS EVIDENCE

01:12:58.941 --> 01:12:59.942
BASED THIRD THAT.

01:13:00.008 --> 01:13:02.144
YOU WORK THE BEST LET'S CONTINUE

01:13:02.211 --> 01:13:03.879
TO SUPPORT OUR OUR VOLUNTEER PRO

01:13:03.946 --> 01:13:05.414
BONTA EERIE PROGRAMS BUT LET'S

01:13:05.481 --> 01:13:06.582
ASSESS THOSE TO DETERMINE

01:13:06.648 --> 01:13:08.183
WHETHER OR NOT THEY WORK IF THEY

01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:10.285
DO WORK AND MANY OF THEM I WOULD

01:13:10.352 --> 01:13:11.487
ASSUME DUE.

01:13:11.553 --> 01:13:12.821
OUT LET'S CONTINUE TO INVEST IN

01:13:12.888 --> 01:13:14.923
THAT AND THEN LET'S ALSO ASSESS

01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:16.358
OUR ACADEMIC AND VOCATIONAL SO I

01:13:16.425 --> 01:13:18.594
THINK IT'S A COMBINATION OF

01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:20.028
DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROGRAMS BUT

01:13:20.095 --> 01:13:24.066
AS WE INDICATED IN THE REPORT

01:13:24.133 --> 01:13:24.967
CORRECTIONS NEEDS TO EVALUATE.

01:13:25.033 --> 01:13:25.534
FIRST OF ALL EVALUATE YOUR

01:13:25.601 --> 01:13:28.137
ASSESSMENT TOOLS BECAUSE THE THE

01:13:28.203 --> 01:13:30.105
POPULATION HAS CHANGED THE TOOLS

01:13:30.172 --> 01:13:32.274
HAVEN'T BEEN VALIDATED FOR A YOU

01:13:32.341 --> 01:13:33.542
KNOW NEARLY A DECADE SOME OF THE

01:13:33.609 --> 01:13:35.144
DATA THEY'VE USED TO VALIDATE

01:13:35.210 --> 01:13:35.978
SOME OF THESE.

01:13:36.044 --> 01:13:37.679
ASSESSMENT TOOLS IS IS BACK FAR

01:13:37.746 --> 01:13:40.849
AS 200-022-0003 THAT'S TOO OLD --

01:13:40.916 --> 01:13:42.217
AND SO.

01:13:42.284 --> 01:13:43.552
THERE'S A VARIETY OF THINGS THAT

01:13:43.619 --> 01:13:45.154
DEPARTMENT CORRECTIONS NEEDS TO

01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:46.789

01:13:53.395 --> 01:13:54.163
DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROGRAMS

PROGRAMS OR A COMBINATION OF

01:13:58.667 --> 01:14:00.702
MULTIPLE PROGRAMS SO THAT THAT

01:14:00.769 --> 01:14:01.937

01:14:10.712 --> 01:14:11.947
TO WHAT WE ALL NEED ABOUT

01:14:12.014 --> 01:14:14.850

01:14:24.259 --> 01:14:25.060
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

01:14:25.127 --> 01:14:26.428
SOMEONE HAS A MISTER DAVID DATE

SOME KIND OF WE GET AN ANSWER WE

01:14:29.097 --> 01:14:30.666
DON'T KNOW.

01:14:30.732 --> 01:14:31.700
AND I WOULD SAY WHAT.

01:14:31.767 --> 01:14:33.535
DEAR IS A WAY YOU CAN CALCULATE

01:14:33.602 --> 01:14:35.237
THAT NAY SAID HOW I SAID WELL

01:14:35.304 --> 01:14:36.705

OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS.

01:14:42.177 --> 01:14:43.345
I'M PRETTY SURE UNLESS THEY'RE

01:14:43.412 --> 01:14:45.080
REALLY GOOD CRIMINALS THAT

01:14:45.147 --> 01:14:46.949
THEY'RE GOING TO WORK NINE TO

01:14:47.015 --> 01:14:48.884
FIVE EVERY DAY.

01:14:48.951 --> 01:14:50.853

DOING CRIME AGAIN.

01:14:59.628 --> 01:15:01.129
AND IS PROBABLY 1100% CHANCE

01:15:01.196 --> 01:15:01.864
THAT IF THEY'RE GOING TO WORK

01:15:01.930 --> 01:15:03.065
EVERY DAY DURING THOSE FIVE

01:15:03.131 --> 01:15:04.633
YEARS THEY DID NOT.

D. PROGRAMS BUT WE'RE ONLY

01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:21.069
LOOKING AT UP 225% OF THOSE AND

01:17:21.136 --> 01:17:22.604
MISTER -- JONES SAWYER WAS

01:17:22.671 --> 01:17:23.739
TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF OTHER

01:17:23.805 --> 01:17:25.340
PROGRAMS AND SOME I'VE ACTUALLY

01:17:25.407 --> 01:17:27.476
SEEN AS WELL OVER A CAL CITY AND

01:17:27.542 --> 01:17:29.911
THE DOGS AND WHAT THAT ACTUALLY

01:17:29.978 --> 01:17:30.812
DOES FOR THE INMATES.

01:17:30.879 --> 01:17:32.014
WHO WERE YOU ABLE TO FIND

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:35.150
ANALYTICS FROM?

01:17:35.217 --> 01:17:37.452
THE CDC ARE ON HOW THAT HAD AN

01:17:37.519 --> 01:17:38.420
AFFECT MEAN BECAUSE IT SOUNDED

01:17:38.487 --> 01:17:39.821
LIKE YOU WERE.

01:17:39.888 --> 01:17:41.656
HAVING ISSUES WITH THE NUMBERS

01:17:41.723 --> 01:17:43.025
IN THE ANALYTICS FOR THE C. B.

01:17:43.091 --> 01:17:44.493
T. PROGRAMS BUT THESE OTHER

01:17:44.559 --> 01:17:45.861
PROGRAMS I WOULD IMAGINE.

01:17:45.927 --> 01:17:47.329
WAS IT THE SAME.

01:17:47.396 --> 01:17:48.997
OUTCOME OR NOT BECAUSE AND

01:17:49.064 --> 01:17:50.999
THAT'S QUESTION WE CAN ASK THE

01:17:51.066 --> 01:17:52.801
NEXT BATTLE.

01:17:52.868 --> 01:17:54.569
RIGHT WHAT WHEN WE I TALKED A

01:17:54.636 --> 01:17:55.904
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE VOLUNTEER

01:17:55.971 --> 01:18:01.610
PROGRAMS AND THEY WERE WERE OF

01:18:01.676 --> 01:18:03.111
HOW SUCCESSFUL THOSE PROGRAMS

01:18:03.178 --> 01:18:04.246
HAVE BEEN BUT WE HAVEN'T SEEN

01:18:04.312 --> 01:18:05.547
ANY PROGRESS TO DATE WITH

01:18:05.614 --> 01:18:07.115
RESPECT TO THAT SO WE DIDN'T SEE

01:18:07.182 --> 01:18:08.250
ANY ANALYTICS.

01:18:08.316 --> 01:18:09.284
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG WE

01:18:09.351 --> 01:18:11.686
DIDN'T SEE ANY ANALYTICS RELATED

01:18:11.753 --> 01:18:13.021
TO HOW SUCCESSFUL OR HOW COST

01:18:13.088 --> 01:18:14.556
EFFECTIVE THESE VOLUNTEER

01:18:14.623 --> 01:18:16.224
PROGRAMS ARMY WE TRY TO USE SOME

01:18:16.291 --> 01:18:17.426
OF THAT TERMINOLOGY IN THE

01:18:17.492 --> 01:18:19.061
REPORT COST EFFECTIVENESS.

01:18:19.127 --> 01:18:20.796
OF THESE PARTICULAR PROGRAMS AND

01:18:20.862 --> 01:18:22.164
THAT'S WHY WE DID THE ANALYSIS

01:18:22.230 --> 01:18:23.665
OF IF YOU.

01:18:23.732 --> 01:18:25.634
YOU KNOW PREVENT ONE ONE OUT OF

01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:26.868
NINE FROM RECENT EVADING IT THE

01:18:26.935 --> 01:18:29.071
PAPER THE THE FOR SOME OF THESE

01:18:29.137 --> 01:18:30.305
PROGRAMS PAY FOR THEMSELVES.

01:18:30.372 --> 01:18:32.307
SO THERE NEEDS TO BE THAT FISCAL

01:18:32.374 --> 01:18:34.876
ANALYSIS OF THE BENEFITS OF SOME

01:18:34.943 --> 01:18:36.111
OF THESE PROGRAMS AND WE DID NOT

01:18:36.178 --> 01:18:37.446
SEE THAT WE LOOKED AT C. B. T.

01:18:37.512 --> 01:18:38.847
BUT WE ALSO TALK TO THEM ABOUT

01:18:38.914 --> 01:18:40.148
THE VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS.

01:18:40.215 --> 01:18:41.850
AND DID NOT SEE ANY IN ANALYTICS

01:18:41.917 --> 01:18:44.052
OR ANY ANALYSIS OF THE COST

01:18:44.119 --> 01:18:45.220
EFFECTIVENESS OF THOSE

01:18:45.287 --> 01:18:46.688
PARTICULAR PROGRAMS AND I WAS

01:18:46.755 --> 01:18:47.522
GONNA ASK THIS LATER A BABY

01:18:47.589 --> 01:18:48.557
ASSETS NOW.

01:18:48.623 --> 01:18:49.825
OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS YOU CAME

01:18:49.891 --> 01:18:50.859
OUT WITH BECAUSE NOW WE'RE AT

01:18:50.926 --> 01:18:53.795
THE SIXTY DAY MARK I COUNTED

01:18:53.862 --> 01:18:55.330
TWENTY FOUR RECOMMENDATIONS.

01:18:55.397 --> 01:18:56.832
THAT WERE LISTED THERE AND OF

01:18:56.898 --> 01:18:57.599
THOSE TWENTY FOUR

01:18:57.666 --> 01:18:59.034
RECOMMENDATIONS HOW MANY.

01:18:59.101 --> 01:19:00.368
THE MISTER PHONE OR YOU WERE

01:19:00.435 --> 01:19:00.969
TALKING ABOUT HOW MANY WERE

01:19:01.036 --> 01:19:02.671
ACTUALLY BEING IMPLEMENTED OF

01:19:02.737 --> 01:19:04.906
THE TWENTY FOUR SO WE CAN AT

01:19:04.973 --> 01:19:06.141
THIRTEEN IS PENDING SO THEY'RE

01:19:06.208 --> 01:19:07.609
IN THE PLANNING STAGES TO BE

01:19:07.676 --> 01:19:09.177
PLANNING IMPLEMENTING OF THOUGHT

01:19:09.244 --> 01:19:10.679
FOR SO THEIR FOURTEEN FOR CDC

01:19:10.745 --> 01:19:12.681
ARE -- THIRTEEN OF THOSE WITH

01:19:12.747 --> 01:19:14.116
CANADA'S PENDING IS AND THERE

01:19:14.182 --> 01:19:15.484
WERE SOME ACTION BUT IT KIND OF

01:19:15.550 --> 01:19:16.685
WAS SO PRELIMINARY THAT WE COULD.

01:19:16.751 --> 01:19:17.919
MAKE A JUDGMENT CALL ON WHETHER

01:19:17.986 --> 01:19:19.054
WAS IMPLEMENTED OR NOT.

01:19:19.121 --> 01:19:20.422
AND THEY HAD PARTIALLY

01:19:20.489 --> 01:19:23.325
IMPLEMENTED ONE RELATED -- TO

01:19:23.391 --> 01:19:23.592
STAFFING.

01:20:06.601 --> 01:20:07.135
THESE ISSUES AND MANY OF THESE

01:20:07.202 --> 01:20:07.936
RECOMMENDATIONS THE THE

01:20:08.003 --> 01:20:09.704
DEPARTMENT WAS AWARE OF MONTHS

01:20:09.771 --> 01:20:10.372

01:20:10.438 --> 01:20:11.840
LONG BEFORE WE ISSUED A REPORT

01:20:11.907 --> 01:20:14.643
IN JANUARY SO THEY HAVE HAD A

01:20:14.709 --> 01:20:16.011
FAIR AMOUNT OF TIME TO REALLY

01:20:16.077 --> 01:20:16.978
THINK ABOUT SOME OF THESE

01:20:17.045 --> 01:20:18.079

01:20:18.146 --> 01:20:19.314
PROGRESS MADE.

01:20:19.381 --> 01:20:20.815
NOW OFTENTIMES I SAY WE DON'T

01:20:20.882 --> 01:20:22.350
LOOK FOR A LOT OF PROGRESS IN

01:20:22.417 --> 01:20:23.285
SIXTY DAYS.

01:20:23.351 --> 01:20:24.853
BUT WE WOULD EXPECT OUR SIX

01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:26.821
MONTH RESPONSE TYPICALLY IS

01:20:26.888 --> 01:20:28.957
WHERE WE REALLY EXPECT PROGRESS

01:20:29.024 --> 01:20:30.392
TO BE MADE AND WE DO HAVE

01:20:30.458 --> 01:20:32.928
CONCERNS BASED ON HISTORICAL.

01:20:32.994 --> 01:20:34.696
OUR WORK IN AUDITING THE

01:20:34.763 --> 01:20:36.231
DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS IN AND

01:20:36.298 --> 01:20:37.832
SOME OF THE DISCUSSION I HAD.

01:20:37.899 --> 01:20:39.100
A WITH YOU REGARDING YOU KNOW

01:20:39.167 --> 01:20:40.635
THEY'VE THOUGHT ABOUT USING AN

01:20:40.702 --> 01:20:41.870
EXTERNAL RESEARCHER BUT THEY

01:20:41.937 --> 01:20:43.038
HAVEN'T DEVELOPED A SCOPE YET

01:20:43.104 --> 01:20:44.172
THEY'RE SUGGESTING THEY'RE GONNA

01:20:44.239 --> 01:20:45.307
HAVE A SCOPE.

01:20:45.373 --> 01:20:47.676
AND A CONTRACT BY APRIL OF

01:20:47.742 --> 01:20:48.276
TWENTY TWENTY THEY SHOULD BE

01:20:48.343 --> 01:20:49.511
WORKING ON THAT NOW THEY SHOULD

01:20:49.578 --> 01:20:51.079
BE ABLE TO SHOW THE LEGISLATURE

01:20:51.146 --> 01:20:52.581
AND PERHAPS US AT LEAST.

01:20:52.647 --> 01:20:54.449
THE BEGINNINGS OF A SCOPE BY THE

01:20:54.516 --> 01:20:56.451
SIX MONTH REACHED A RESPONSE IN

01:20:56.518 --> 01:20:57.385
JULY.

01:20:57.452 --> 01:20:59.354
US BECAUSE WE'RE WE'RE GIVING

01:20:59.421 --> 01:21:00.922
THEM A THREE YEAR PLAN BUT WE

01:21:00.989 --> 01:21:02.624
NEED TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE TO

01:21:02.691 --> 01:21:05.026
THAT PLAN.

01:21:05.093 --> 01:21:07.028
AND AS AS MR FELDER SAID A LOT

01:21:07.095 --> 01:21:08.296
OF MORE PENDING AND THAT'S A

01:21:08.363 --> 01:21:10.398
REALLY THAT'S A CONCERN TO US TO

01:21:10.465 --> 01:21:11.566
ME IN PARTICULAR AS THE STATE

01:21:11.633 --> 01:21:12.334
AUDITOR.

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:14.302
I WANT TO SEE MORE PROGRESS FROM

01:21:14.369 --> 01:21:16.805
THE DEPARTMENT -- AND HOPEFULLY

01:21:16.871 --> 01:21:18.106
WE WILL SEE THAT AT THE SIX

01:21:18.173 --> 01:21:19.074
MONTH OR PERHAPS WILL BE OVER

01:21:19.140 --> 01:21:20.208
HERE FROM THE DEPARTMENT TODAY

01:21:20.275 --> 01:21:21.743
WHERE THEY'VE MADE A BIT MORE

01:21:21.810 --> 01:21:23.378
PROGRESS IN SOME OF THESE AREAS

01:21:23.445 --> 01:21:25.780
BECAUSE THAT EXTERNAL RESEARCHER

01:21:25.847 --> 01:21:27.082
GETTING THE DATA.

01:21:27.148 --> 01:21:28.817
THEY WILL HAVE THE INFORMATION

01:21:28.883 --> 01:21:30.585
TO BE ABLE TO DO AN ANALYSIS OF

01:21:30.652 --> 01:21:31.953
THE RECIDIVISM RATE.

01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:32.988
YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE

01:21:33.054 --> 01:21:34.756
SCOPE IS IS COPING TO BE LIMITED

01:21:34.823 --> 01:21:36.124
TO CBT PROGRAMS IS GOING TO BE

01:21:36.191 --> 01:21:37.492
LOOKING AT THE ACADEMIC IS A

01:21:37.559 --> 01:21:38.860
GOING TO BE LOOKING AT FOLK AT

01:21:38.927 --> 01:21:39.628
IS GOING TO BE LOOKING AT

01:21:39.694 --> 01:21:40.495
VOLUNTEER.

01:21:40.562 --> 01:21:41.529
ARE YOU GONNA LOOK AT HOW ARE

01:21:41.596 --> 01:21:43.398
THEY PRIORITIZING WHEN ARE THEY

01:21:43.465 --> 01:21:44.933
GOING TO RE ASSESS THESE TOOLS

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.334
THERE'S A VARIETY OF FACTORS

01:21:46.401 --> 01:21:48.203
THAT IN IMPACT.

01:21:48.270 --> 01:21:49.537
THE STATE'S ABILITY TO REALLY

01:21:49.604 --> 01:21:52.140
PROVIDE SERVICES AND MY WORDS TO

01:21:52.207 --> 01:21:54.376
INMATES TO TO INCREASE THEIR

01:21:54.442 --> 01:21:55.343
THEIR POSSIBILITY BEING

01:21:55.410 --> 01:21:57.545
SUCCESSFUL MAKE WHEN THEY ARE

01:21:57.612 --> 01:21:58.513
RELEASED FROM PRISON IN

01:21:58.580 --> 01:21:59.247
CALIFORNIA.

01:21:59.314 --> 01:22:00.215
SO THAT THEY ARE NOW AND I WOULD

01:22:00.282 --> 01:22:01.383
IMAGINE IT WOULD BEHOOVE THE

01:22:01.449 --> 01:22:02.784
DEPARTMENT ACTUALLY HAVE SOME OF

01:22:02.851 --> 01:22:03.985
THOSE ANALYTICS ESPECIALLY WHEN

01:22:04.052 --> 01:22:04.953
YOU'RE LOOKING AT EDUCATION

01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:06.588
PROGRAMS OF YOU COULD SAY 80% OF

01:22:06.655 --> 01:22:07.555
THE FOLKS.

01:22:07.622 --> 01:22:09.190
THAT RUN IT IS PROGRAM GRADUATE

01:22:09.257 --> 01:22:11.493
WITH A DEGREE ECCENTRIC -- SO

01:22:11.559 --> 01:22:12.460
DEFINITELY AGREE WITH YOU LET'S

01:22:12.527 --> 01:22:13.228

MISS JONES SAWYER WAS TRYING TO

01:22:17.666 --> 01:22:22.270
MAKE BECAUSE YOU KNOW.

01:22:22.337 --> 01:22:23.905
OUR INTENT IS IN -- TO BE MYOPIC

01:22:23.972 --> 01:22:25.607
WHEN IT COMES TO THE APPROACH

01:22:25.674 --> 01:22:27.375
THAT WE EXPECT THE DEPARTMENT TO

01:22:27.442 --> 01:22:28.943
TAKE WHEN IT WHEN IT COMES TO

01:22:29.010 --> 01:22:30.445
THESE PROGRAMS WE WE WANT ALLOW

01:22:30.512 --> 01:22:32.113
FOR CREATIVITY WE WANT ALLOW FOR

01:22:32.180 --> 01:22:34.182
INNOVATION -- BUT ONE THING THAT

01:22:34.249 --> 01:22:36.484
HAS BEEN SO -- PREVALENT IN MY

01:22:36.551 --> 01:22:37.919
IN MY EXPERIENCE IN THE SEVEN

01:22:37.986 --> 01:22:38.520
YEARS THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE

01:22:38.586 --> 01:22:39.654
LEGISLATURE OUR STATE AGENCIES

01:22:39.721 --> 01:22:40.855
IN THE COMPLACENCY WITHIN THE

01:22:40.922 --> 01:22:42.390
STATE AGENCIES TO JUST GO ALONG

01:22:42.457 --> 01:22:43.491
AND GO WITH WITH THIS IS THE WAY

01:22:43.558 --> 01:22:44.592
THINGS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN DONE.

01:22:44.659 --> 01:22:45.794
THAT'S THAT'S WHY WE GET INTO A

01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:48.229
LOT OF TROUBLE AND THAT'S WHY --

01:22:48.296 --> 01:22:49.864
OVERSIGHT OVER THIS LEGISLATIVE

01:22:49.931 --> 01:22:51.433
BODY HAS BECOME SO IMPORTANT IN

01:22:51.499 --> 01:22:54.436
SUCH A IT ISSUE SUCH THAT WE ARE

01:22:54.502 --> 01:22:56.838
FOCUSING A LOT MORE ATTENTION ON

01:22:56.905 --> 01:22:58.306
I'M A LOT MORE ATTENTION ON OUR

01:22:58.373 --> 01:23:02.277
OVERSIGHT -- CAPACITY BECAUSE

01:23:02.344 --> 01:23:03.845
YOU KNOW.

01:23:03.912 --> 01:23:05.213
WE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY AND WE

01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:06.715
DO KNOW THAT THAT MONEY IS BEING

01:23:06.781 --> 01:23:09.184
SPENT IN THE RIGHT PLACES -- YOU

01:23:09.250 --> 01:23:11.353
KNOW THERE COULD BE A PROGRAM

01:23:11.419 --> 01:23:13.355
YOU KNOW IT FROM FOLKS THAT I'VE

01:23:13.421 --> 01:23:13.955
BEEN ABLE TO TALK TO THAT'S IN

01:23:14.022 --> 01:23:14.689
OUR PROGRAM.

01:23:14.756 --> 01:23:16.958
THAT DOES WONDERS FOR CERTAIN

01:23:17.025 --> 01:23:18.159
GROUP CERTAIN GROUP OF PEOPLE

01:23:18.226 --> 01:23:19.227
AND WE WERE DEALING WITH SO MANY

01:23:19.294 --> 01:23:20.795
DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES SO MANY

01:23:20.862 --> 01:23:22.130
DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS.

01:23:22.197 --> 01:23:24.366
YOU KNOW VARIETY AND PROGRAMS

01:23:24.432 --> 01:23:27.802
ARE IMPORTANT -- AND YOU KNOW IT

01:23:27.869 --> 01:23:29.838
IT WAS IT IS INTERESTING HERE

01:23:29.904 --> 01:23:30.805
ABOUT THE EVIDENCE BASED

01:23:30.872 --> 01:23:32.240
PROGRAMS THAT THE THE LIMITED

01:23:32.307 --> 01:23:34.075
PULL I IN TERMS OF THE SCOPE OF

01:23:34.142 --> 01:23:35.310
THOSE PROGRAMS THAT THAT IT

01:23:35.377 --> 01:23:36.444
DOESN'T REALLY GO BEYOND LIKE

01:23:36.511 --> 01:23:38.580
SAY JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS -- I

01:23:38.646 --> 01:23:40.281
THINK JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS ARE

01:23:40.348 --> 01:23:42.250
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT -- WHEN IT

01:23:42.317 --> 01:23:44.185
COMES TO REHABILITATION YOU HAVE

01:23:44.252 --> 01:23:46.087
SOMEBODY WHO SPENT TEN YEARS IN

01:23:46.154 --> 01:23:47.288
PRISON?

01:23:47.355 --> 01:23:48.690
YOU KNOW THEY MAY MAY HAVE GONE

01:23:48.757 --> 01:23:52.227
IN FOR A DRUG CHARGE -- BUT TEN

01:23:52.293 --> 01:23:53.428
YEARS IN PRISON IF THEY DIDN'T

01:23:53.495 --> 01:23:54.696
GET THE THE THE SERVICE AT THAT

01:23:54.763 --> 01:23:55.797
THEY THAT THEY NEEDED TO TAKE

01:23:55.864 --> 01:23:57.332
CARE OF THEIR JOB DRUG PROBLEM

01:23:57.399 --> 01:23:59.100
WHICH OFTEN HAPPENS -- AND

01:23:59.167 --> 01:24:00.468
SOMETIMES THEY HAVE A DRUG

01:24:00.535 --> 01:24:01.936
PROBLEM THIS DEVELOP BECAUSE OF

01:24:02.003 --> 01:24:04.906
OF A MISDIAGNOSIS UNDIAGNOSED

01:24:04.973 --> 01:24:06.975
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE -- BUT THEY

01:24:07.041 --> 01:24:08.443
SPEND TEN YEARS PLUS IN PRISON

01:24:08.510 --> 01:24:09.677
BECAUSE OF THAT.

01:24:09.744 --> 01:24:10.979
AND THEY COME OUT THEY'RE

01:24:11.045 --> 01:24:12.547
DIFFERENT PERSON -- AND IT IS

01:24:12.614 --> 01:24:14.015
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO EXPECT

01:24:14.082 --> 01:24:15.417
THEM TO BECOME AN ACTIVE

01:24:15.483 --> 01:24:17.986
PARTICIPANT IN SOCIETY WHEN YOU

01:24:18.052 --> 01:24:20.455
KNOW WE ARE NOT OFFERING.

01:24:20.522 --> 01:24:22.690
PROGRAMS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO

01:24:22.757 --> 01:24:23.591
WHAT THEIR LIFE IS GOING TO BE

01:24:23.658 --> 01:24:25.326
LIKE WHEN THEY GET OUT OF PRISON

01:24:25.393 --> 01:24:26.961
BECAUSE ALSO WHEN THEY WENT INTO

01:24:27.028 --> 01:24:28.863
PRISON THE WORLD WAS A VERY

01:24:28.930 --> 01:24:29.764
DIFFERENT PLACE THAN WHEN

01:24:29.831 --> 01:24:30.565
THEY'RE COMING OUT.

01:24:30.632 --> 01:24:32.934
OF PRISON -- AND SO YOU KNOW OUR

01:24:33.001 --> 01:24:35.937
INTENT OUR INTENT IS IN TO TO

01:24:36.004 --> 01:24:36.805
LIMIT THE ABILITY FOR THE

01:24:36.871 --> 01:24:38.740
DEPARTMENT TO BE CREATIVE AND

01:24:38.807 --> 01:24:39.574
INNOVATIVE IN THE PROGRAMS

01:24:39.641 --> 01:24:40.809
AREN'T OUR INTENT IS TO

01:24:40.875 --> 01:24:42.744
HOPEFULLY INSPIRE THEM -- BUT

01:24:42.811 --> 01:24:44.212
ALSO WE NEED METRICS TO

01:24:44.279 --> 01:24:45.580
PERFORMANCE METRICS IN ORDER TO

01:24:45.647 --> 01:24:47.849
DETERMINE THAT -- WE ARE GETTING

01:24:47.916 --> 01:24:48.850
THAT RETURN ON INVESTMENT IS

01:24:48.917 --> 01:24:51.052
JONES JONES SAWYER DOES.

01:24:51.119 --> 01:24:52.654
ALLUDE TO AND WE HAVE TO HAVE A

01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:55.323
HIGH STANDARD WHEN IT COMES TO

01:24:55.390 --> 01:24:56.324
THE PEOPLE THAT WE ALLOWED TO

01:24:56.391 --> 01:24:58.059
COME AND RUN A REHABILITATION

01:24:58.126 --> 01:24:59.561
PROGRAM BECAUSE I KNOW THAT

01:24:59.627 --> 01:25:00.428
THERE ARE PROGRAMS THAT ARE RUN

01:25:00.495 --> 01:25:03.231
WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT -- THAT

01:25:03.298 --> 01:25:05.567
SOMETIMESME THEY GET PAID BASED

01:25:05.633 --> 01:25:07.202
OFF OF THE INDIVIDUAL SOME

01:25:07.268 --> 01:25:08.837
INDIVIDUALS THEY GET TO SIGN UP

01:25:08.903 --> 01:25:12.140
AND MAYBE -- IT ISN'T SO MUCH

01:25:12.207 --> 01:25:14.309
ABOUT ACTUALLY HAVING THEM DO

01:25:16.077 --> 01:25:16.578

WHATEVER.

01:25:17.378 --> 01:25:19.013
WHATEVER THEY'RE OFFERING IT'S

01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:20.515
IT'S ABOUT GETTING THE

01:25:20.582 --> 01:25:21.649
SIGNATURES AND GETTING THE NAMES

INCENTIVES THAT ARE THAT MY AND

01:25:31.659 --> 01:25:32.994

OFFER A PROGRAM.

01:25:36.231 --> 01:25:37.198
WITHOUT NECESSARILY HAVING TO

01:25:37.265 --> 01:25:38.633
PARTICIPATE.

01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:40.535
IN THAT PROGRAM THE WIDGET WE WE

01:25:40.602 --> 01:25:42.170
SPEND SO MUCH MONEY WE HAVE TO

01:25:42.237 --> 01:25:43.137
WE HAVE TO KNOW WHERE THAT

01:25:43.204 --> 01:25:44.939
MONEY'S GOING AND HAS TO BE

01:25:45.006 --> 01:25:45.507
ACCOUNTABILITY AND HOW THESE

01:25:45.573 --> 01:25:48.610
PROGRAMS ARE.

01:25:48.676 --> 01:25:49.777
ADMINISTERED WELL.

01:25:49.844 --> 01:25:50.311
I I'M GONNA HAVE TO LEAVE

01:25:50.378 --> 01:25:52.013
BECAUSE I HAVE -- MEETING THEM

01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:53.348
HAVE TO GO ATTEND BUT AND I LOOK

01:25:53.414 --> 01:25:55.483
FORWARD TO HEARING THE TESTIMONY

01:25:55.550 --> 01:25:56.885
AND THE MEN THE SUMMARY FROM MY

01:25:56.951 --> 01:25:58.353
STAFF WHEN IT COMES TO THE

01:25:58.419 --> 01:26:00.955
TESTIMONY OF THAT -- THE THE THE

01:26:01.022 --> 01:26:02.290
DEPARTMENT BOB.

01:26:02.357 --> 01:26:04.959
BUT THIS MATTERS AND WE SPEND A

01:26:05.026 --> 01:26:06.194
LOT OF MONEY NOT JUST IN A

01:26:06.261 --> 01:26:07.595
REHABILITATION PROGRAM BUT ON

01:26:07.662 --> 01:26:08.663
CORRECTIONS.

01:26:08.730 --> 01:26:12.433
AND SO THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS

01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:14.602
AUDIT WAS TO GET.

01:26:14.669 --> 01:26:15.970
WAS TO GET THE INFORMATION THAT

01:26:16.037 --> 01:26:18.373
WE GOT IT ISN'T SURPRISING TO ME

01:26:18.439 --> 01:26:20.108
THAT THE MAN FROM NATION.

01:26:20.174 --> 01:26:20.708
THE INFORMATION THAT WE DID

01:26:20.775 --> 01:26:22.777
RECEIVE BECAUSE THAT WAS THIS

01:26:22.844 --> 01:26:24.479
THAT'S DOUBTS WHAT WE SUSPECTED

01:26:24.546 --> 01:26:25.813
BUT IT'S ALSO PARTLY OUR FAULT

01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:26.915
BECAUSE WE NEVER.

01:26:26.981 --> 01:26:28.650
LOOKED AT IT BECAUSE WE WERE

01:26:28.716 --> 01:26:33.154
NEVER FOR SMALL IN AND IN OUR IN

01:26:33.221 --> 01:26:34.889
OUR ABILITY TO ASK FOR THAT

01:26:34.956 --> 01:26:36.357
INFORMATION IN TO GET THAT A

01:26:36.424 --> 01:26:38.126
TYPE OF INFORMATION SO WE REALLY

01:26:38.192 --> 01:26:39.827
APPRECIATE I REALLY APPRECIATE.

01:26:39.894 --> 01:26:41.796
THE WORK THAT YOU GUYS HAVE DONE --

01:26:41.863 --> 01:26:43.865
BUT I REALLY WANT THIS TO BE

01:26:43.932 --> 01:26:46.267
MOTIVATING.

01:26:46.334 --> 01:26:47.602
FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED ESPECIALLY

01:26:47.669 --> 01:26:49.837
THE DEPARTMENT TO HAVE A HIGHER

01:26:49.904 --> 01:26:50.972
STANDARD HOLD THEMSELVES TO A

01:26:51.039 --> 01:26:53.841
HIGHER STANDARD AND UNDERSTAND.

01:26:53.908 --> 01:26:56.177
THE IMPORTANCE OF RUNNING THESE

01:26:56.244 --> 01:26:57.612
PROGRAMS AND MAKING SURE THAT WE

01:26:57.679 --> 01:26:58.813
HAVE THE BEST POSSIBLEPROGRAMS

01:26:58.880 --> 01:26:59.747
THAT ARE PROVIDING THESE PEOPLE

01:26:59.814 --> 01:27:01.449
THAT ARE GONNA GET OUT

01:27:01.516 --> 01:27:02.784
EVENTUALLY THE THE BEST

01:27:02.850 --> 01:27:04.152
OPPORTUNITIES TO BE SUCCESSFUL

01:27:04.218 --> 01:27:05.420
SO THAT THEY DO NOT RECEIVE A

01:27:05.486 --> 01:27:06.788
BECAUSE IT COSTS TOO MUCH MONEY.

01:27:06.854 --> 01:27:08.423
AND WE ARE MOVING AWAY FROM THIS

01:27:08.489 --> 01:27:09.991
IDEA OF LOCK HIM UP AND THROW

01:27:10.058 --> 01:27:11.225
AWAY THE KEY.

01:27:11.292 --> 01:27:13.561
AND TOWARDS THE IDEA AND TOWARDS

01:27:13.628 --> 01:27:15.530
A PRACTICE OF REHABILITATE AND

01:27:15.597 --> 01:27:16.931
THEN ALSO INJECT MORE MONEY INTO

01:27:16.998 --> 01:27:17.932
LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES WHICH

01:27:17.999 --> 01:27:19.334
WE STILL NEED TO DO THIS AND TO

01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:20.668
LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES TO

01:27:20.735 --> 01:27:21.569
PREVENT.

01:27:21.636 --> 01:27:22.804
THOSE KIDS ARE GROWING UP IN

01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:24.172
THIS LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES TO

01:27:24.238 --> 01:27:25.506
FROM EVER BELIEVING THAT THE

01:27:25.573 --> 01:27:26.708
ONLY WAY THAT THEY CAN BE

01:27:26.774 --> 01:27:27.809
SUCCESSFUL AND HAVE A GOOD LIFE

01:27:27.875 --> 01:27:29.243
IS TO SELL DRUGS TO JOIN A GANG.

01:27:29.310 --> 01:27:30.345
BECAUSE THAT'S ALL THEY KNOW AND

01:27:30.411 --> 01:27:31.512
THAT'S WHAT THEY GREW UP WITH

01:27:31.579 --> 01:27:32.747
AND THAT'S WHAT THE ROLE MODELS

01:27:32.814 --> 01:27:32.947
DID.

01:27:33.014 --> 01:27:34.549
IN ORDER STE IN ORDER TO SURVIVE

01:27:34.616 --> 01:27:36.050
AND SO THAT'S WHERE THE FOCUS

01:27:36.117 --> 01:27:39.153
NEEDS TO BE NOT NECESSARILY ON

01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:39.754
YOU KNOW.

01:27:39.821 --> 01:27:40.989
THIS LOCK THEM UP AND THROW AWAY

01:27:41.055 --> 01:27:42.423
THE KEY ENTRY EVERYBODY THE SAME

01:27:42.490 --> 01:27:43.524
AS IF EVERYBODY'S LIFE TO BE

01:27:43.591 --> 01:27:44.525
EXPERIENCES ARE THE SAME

01:27:44.592 --> 01:27:45.660
EVERYBODY GREW UP THE SAME SET

01:27:45.727 --> 01:27:46.628
OF CIRCUMSTANCES BECAUSE IT

01:27:46.694 --> 01:27:48.496
MATTERS AND THAT EVERYBODY DID.

01:27:48.563 --> 01:27:49.731
BUT I REALLY THINK YOU -- AND

01:27:49.797 --> 01:27:54.202

ABOUT THE SIXTY FOUR MILLION WE

01:28:01.009 --> 01:28:02.176
GAVE THREE YEARS AGO AND WHAT

01:28:02.243 --> 01:28:03.378
ARE WE GETTING OUT OF THAT ARE

01:28:03.444 --> 01:28:05.246
MORE THE ANALYTICS FOR IT -- THE

01:28:05.313 --> 01:28:06.347
SIXTY DAY CHECK IN BUT WE ALSO

01:28:06.414 --> 01:28:07.081
HAVE THE SIX MONTH AND

01:28:07.148 --> 01:28:08.716
ESPECIALLY AS WE MOVE INTO THE

01:28:08.783 --> 01:28:09.884
MAY REVISE.

01:28:09.951 --> 01:28:11.519
AND THE ULTIMATE -- BUDGET IN

01:28:11.586 --> 01:28:13.755
JUNE THESE ARE THESE ARE ANSWERS

01:28:13.821 --> 01:28:15.523
THAT WE ALL UP HERE WANT. TO

01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:16.958
HAVE SO THAT WERE INFORMED ABOUT

01:28:17.025 --> 01:28:18.660
HOW WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT I

01:28:18.726 --> 01:28:20.361
KNOW MISS COM LONGER DOVE HAS A

01:28:20.428 --> 01:28:22.163
QUESTION.

01:28:22.230 --> 01:28:24.866
WE'LL GO AHEAD AND MOVE TO MESS

01:28:24.932 --> 01:28:26.768
BAUER-KAHAN.

01:28:26.834 --> 01:28:29.303
FIRST PLACE RIBBON.

01:28:29.370 --> 01:28:29.671
COMMENTED AFTER.

01:28:29.737 --> 01:28:33.174
YES -- THANK YOU FOR THIS REPORT

AND FOR YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS I

01:28:34.575 --> 01:28:36.177
WANT TO ECHO THE OPINIONS OF MY

01:28:36.244 --> 01:28:38.246
COLLEAGUES THAT YOU KNOW WE WANT

01:28:38.312 --> 01:28:39.747
TO RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENT WHEN

01:28:39.814 --> 01:28:40.882
IT COMES OR SPENDING.

01:28:40.948 --> 01:28:42.684
IN OUR PRISON SYSTEM BUT I ALSO

01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:43.951
WANT TO SAY THAT.

01:28:44.018 --> 01:28:45.820
RECIDIVISM ALSO MEANS CRIMES ARE

01:28:45.887 --> 01:28:47.288
BEING COMMITTED OUR COMMUNITIES

01:28:47.355 --> 01:28:48.756
WHICH MEANS WHEN WE REDUCE

01:28:48.823 --> 01:28:49.957
RECIDIVISM WE MAKE OUR

01:28:50.024 --> 01:28:51.325
COMMUNITIES SAFER WE ALSO

01:28:51.392 --> 01:28:53.027
INCREASE WE ARE OUTCOMES ARE

01:28:53.094 --> 01:28:53.961
BETTER FOR THOSE WHEN THEY CAN

01:28:54.028 --> 01:28:55.163
REENTER SOCIETY AND DO SO

01:28:55.229 --> 01:28:56.230
SUCCESSFULLY SO THERE'S A WHOLE

01:28:56.297 --> 01:28:57.231
HOST OF REASONS.

01:28:57.298 --> 01:28:58.866
WHY WE SHOULD BE DRIVING FOR

01:28:58.933 --> 01:28:59.667
SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMMING OUR

01:28:59.734 --> 01:29:00.935
PRISONS AND SO I APPRECIATE YOUR

01:29:01.002 --> 01:29:02.570
WORK ON THAT -- ONE OF THE

01:29:02.637 --> 01:29:03.805
THINGS THAT WE KEEP TALKING

01:29:03.871 --> 01:29:06.441
ABOUT IS EVIDENCE BASED IN

01:29:06.507 --> 01:29:07.008
METRICS IN THE IMPORTANCE OF

01:29:07.075 --> 01:29:07.975
THAT.

01:29:08.042 --> 01:29:09.277
I AM NEW TO POLITICS INTO

01:29:09.343 --> 01:29:10.411
GOVERNMENT I COME OUT OF THE

01:29:10.478 --> 01:29:11.479
PRIVATE SECTOR AND TO ME IT IS

01:29:11.546 --> 01:29:13.881
FASCINATING THAT WE CAN'T MAKE

01:29:13.948 --> 01:29:15.650
MORE DATA DRIVEN DECISIONS.

01:29:15.717 --> 01:29:17.018
WHICH IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS

01:29:17.085 --> 01:29:17.919
HOW WE MAKE DECISIONS IF YOU

01:29:17.985 --> 01:29:19.387
KNOW SO ONE OF THE THINGS I'M

01:29:19.454 --> 01:29:20.922
LEARNING IS THAT OUR DATA IS SO

01:29:20.988 --> 01:29:22.523
SEGREGATED THAT IT IS HARD TO

01:29:22.590 --> 01:29:24.792
KNOW OBVIOUSLY THE QUESTION THE

01:29:24.859 --> 01:29:25.860
ONE NEEDS TO ASK TO SEE IF THESE

01:29:25.927 --> 01:29:26.494
PROGRAMS.

01:29:26.561 --> 01:29:27.695
ARE WORKING -- VERY

01:29:27.762 --> 01:29:29.263
STRAIGHTFORWARD WEEK PEOPLE SIGN

01:29:29.330 --> 01:29:30.832
UP WE KNOW WHICH PROGRAMS EACH

01:29:30.898 --> 01:29:32.400
INMATE TAKES IF THEY COMMIT A

01:29:32.467 --> 01:29:33.367
CRIME THERE'S A SEPARATE SYSTEM

01:29:33.434 --> 01:29:34.402
THAT TELLS US THAT THEY'VE BEEN

01:29:34.469 --> 01:29:35.737
CHARGED WITH A CRIME.

01:29:35.803 --> 01:29:37.004
SO THE QUESTION OF RESIDENT

01:29:37.071 --> 01:29:38.740
RECIDIVISM AND THE PROGRAMMING

01:29:38.806 --> 01:29:40.274
THAT WORK SHOULD BE VERY

01:29:40.341 --> 01:29:41.375
STRAIGHT FORWARD BUT WHAT I'M

01:29:41.442 --> 01:29:42.710
HEARING TODAY IS THAT WE'RE NOT

01:29:42.777 --> 01:29:44.278
ABLE TO PUT THAT DATA TOGETHER

01:29:44.345 --> 01:29:45.613
TO MAKE DATA DRIVEN DECISIONS

01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:47.215
ABOUT WHICH OF THESE PROGRAMS.

01:29:47.281 --> 01:29:49.117
ARE SUCCESSFUL REPLICATE THOSE

01:29:49.183 --> 01:29:50.384
INSURE THOSE ARE BEING PUT INTO

01:29:50.451 --> 01:29:52.053
ALL OF OUR PRISONS AND ENSURE

01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:53.788
THE PEOPLE OF ACCESS TO THOSE DO

01:29:53.855 --> 01:29:55.256
YOU HAVE A SENSE AND WE CAN ASK

01:29:55.323 --> 01:29:56.624
THE DEPARTMENT THIS IS WELL.

01:29:56.691 --> 01:29:58.860
YOU KNOW WE'RE IS THE FAILURE IN

01:29:58.926 --> 01:30:00.595
OUR DATA SYSTEM TO BE ABLE TO

01:30:00.661 --> 01:30:02.096
PUT THESE ANSWERS TOGETHER.

01:30:02.163 --> 01:30:03.664
I THINK A GOOD EXAMPLE THAT FROM

01:30:03.731 --> 01:30:05.666
OUR REPORT IS -- THE LACK OF

01:30:05.733 --> 01:30:08.236
COORDINATION BETWEEN EDT AND CDC

01:30:08.302 --> 01:30:09.871
ARE REGARDING VOCATIONAL

01:30:09.937 --> 01:30:11.906
PROGRAMMING SO WE THOUGHT THAT

01:30:11.973 --> 01:30:13.508
IT BE PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD TO

01:30:13.574 --> 01:30:14.242
HEAD INMATE.

01:30:14.308 --> 01:30:15.309
ALL RIGHT THEY'VE GOT YOU KNOW

01:30:15.376 --> 01:30:16.344
THEY GET THE X. RECEIVES A

01:30:16.410 --> 01:30:17.879
VOCATIONAL TRAINING AND THEN

01:30:17.945 --> 01:30:19.413
THEY'RE GOING TO GO OUT WELL DID

01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:20.515
THEY GET A JOB.

01:30:20.581 --> 01:30:21.983
IS AND THE THING THEY WERE

01:30:22.049 --> 01:30:22.583
TRAINED IT RIGHT IN THERE IN

01:30:22.650 --> 01:30:23.618
THAT FIELD.

01:30:23.684 --> 01:30:26.053
AND THAT CDC ARE IN ET DE HAD

01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:27.488
BEEN TRYING TO WORK TOGETHER FOR

01:30:27.555 --> 01:30:28.456
A LONG PERIOD OF TIME BUT THERE

01:30:28.523 --> 01:30:30.458
HAD BEEN SEVERAL ISSUES RELATED%

01:30:30.525 --> 01:30:31.659
TO SHARING AND SOCIAL SECURITY

01:30:31.726 --> 01:30:35.763
pRELATED CONCERNS.

01:30:35.830 --> 01:30:36.397
AND IT'S A WE HAVE A

01:30:36.464 --> 01:30:38.766
RECOMMENDATION ALL REPORT -- ONE

01:30:38.833 --> 01:30:40.835
LEGISLATIVE TO AMEND THE LAW TO

01:30:40.902 --> 01:30:42.203
MAKE IT EASIER TO COORDINATE.

01:30:42.270 --> 01:30:44.038
AND SECONDLY JUST TO ENCOURAGE

01:30:44.105 --> 01:30:45.807
YOU TO SEE OUR I NEEDED TO WORK

01:30:45.873 --> 01:30:46.407
TO WORK OUT THEIR DIFFERENCES

01:30:46.474 --> 01:30:47.875
NOW THERE ARE THERE ARE.

01:30:47.942 --> 01:30:49.343
DIFFICULTIES BECAUSE OF SOCIAL

01:30:49.410 --> 01:30:51.579
SECURITY NUMBERS -- YOU NOTED

01:30:51.646 --> 01:30:58.953
THAT -- A FORMER APART MAYBE BY

01:30:59.020 --> 01:30:59.754
USING MULTIPLE SO SECURITY

01:30:59.821 --> 01:31:00.555
NUMBERS ARE DIFFERENT NAMES.

01:31:00.621 --> 01:31:01.389
BUT THE THERE ARE CERTAINLY WAYS

01:31:01.455 --> 01:31:03.324
YOU CAN DO THIS AND THAT YOU

01:31:03.391 --> 01:31:04.926
KNOW.

01:31:04.992 --> 01:31:05.993
THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:31:06.060 --> 01:31:07.528
WE FOUND IT OKAY IF WE CAN IF WE

01:31:07.595 --> 01:31:08.596
CAN BRING THESE TWO ENTITIES

01:31:08.663 --> 01:31:09.597
TOGETHER AND GET A WORKING

01:31:09.664 --> 01:31:10.131
TOGETHER.

01:31:10.198 --> 01:31:11.566
THEN WE CAN ACTUALLY SEE WHICH

01:31:11.632 --> 01:31:13.701
VOCATIONAL PROGRAMS WORK BEST

01:31:13.768 --> 01:31:15.536
AND THEN FINAL IT'LL BE FUN TO

01:31:15.603 --> 01:31:16.404
MORE MONEY TOWARD THOSE GUYS

01:31:16.470 --> 01:31:17.738
WERE SAYING -- THESE ARE THE

01:31:17.805 --> 01:31:19.307
ONES THAT WORKING THERE COULD

01:31:19.373 --> 01:31:20.675
NOT ONLY KEEP PEOPLE PLOY THAT

01:31:20.741 --> 01:31:21.242
THAT MEANS ARE NOT POSITIVE

01:31:21.309 --> 01:31:22.143
AIDING.

01:31:22.210 --> 01:31:24.612
SO -- THAT.

01:31:24.679 --> 01:31:28.049
THAT KIND OF GIVES YOU SOME IDEA

01:31:28.115 --> 01:31:28.916
OF WHAT WE'RE TO WHAT WE FOUND.

01:31:28.983 --> 01:31:29.750
YEAH I MEAN AS I'VE COME HERE

01:31:29.817 --> 01:31:31.686
AND YOU KNOW ASK THESE QUESTIONS

01:31:31.752 --> 01:31:32.553
YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE NEED TO LOOK

01:31:32.620 --> 01:31:33.454
AT THE STATE LEVEL BUT ALSO THE

01:31:33.521 --> 01:31:34.822
COUNTY LEVEL RIGHT WHICH WERE

01:31:34.889 --> 01:31:36.958
IMPRISONED MORE PEOPLE IN THE

01:31:37.024 --> 01:31:37.558
COUNTY PRESENCE AS WELL THESE

01:31:37.625 --> 01:31:39.694
DAYS. ONE OF THE ANSWERS I GOT

01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:41.295
WAS WELL WE DON'T WANT TO TELL

01:31:41.362 --> 01:31:41.929
YOU THAT BECAUSE YOU MIGHT TAKE

01:31:41.996 --> 01:31:43.598
THE MONEY AWAY CLICK WELL.

01:31:43.664 --> 01:31:44.632
YES OF ITS NOT WORKING WE ARE

01:31:44.699 --> 01:31:46.534
GOING TO STOP WE SHOULD NOT BE

01:31:46.601 --> 01:31:48.069
SPENDING ON THAT PROGRAM THAT

01:31:48.135 --> 01:31:48.836
ISN'T TO SAY WILL TAKE MONEY

01:31:48.903 --> 01:31:50.571
AWAY FOR PROGRAMMING BUT LET'S

01:31:50.638 --> 01:31:52.206
SPEND IT ON THE ONES THAT WORK

01:31:52.273 --> 01:31:52.874
AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO HAVE

01:31:52.940 --> 01:31:53.708
A MORE.

01:31:53.774 --> 01:31:55.243
OPEN DIALOGUE ABOUT WHAT IS

01:31:55.309 --> 01:31:57.178
SUCCESSFUL WHAT IS WORKING AND

01:31:57.245 --> 01:31:58.412
SPEND APPROPRIATELY AND TO THE

01:31:58.479 --> 01:31:59.814
EXTENT THAT THEIR FIXES THAT WE

01:31:59.881 --> 01:32:01.716
CAN PUT IN TO MAKE THAT EASIER I

01:32:01.782 --> 01:32:03.451
THINK WE SHOULD LOOK LONG AND

01:32:03.517 --> 01:32:04.452
HARD AT THAT THANK YOU.

01:32:04.518 --> 01:32:05.686
AND I THINK THAT'S CORRECT WAIT

01:32:05.753 --> 01:32:07.922
ACTUALLY ASSASSIN LOOK AT IT

01:32:07.989 --> 01:32:10.258
BECAUSE YOU DON'T SHOW IF IT'S

01:32:10.324 --> 01:32:11.726
ACTUALLY WORKING.

01:32:11.792 --> 01:32:12.860
YOU KNOW I KNOW THE BUDGET SUB

01:32:12.927 --> 01:32:13.995
COMMITTEES WILL PROBABLY BE LIKE

01:32:14.061 --> 01:32:14.762
WELL IF YOU CAN'T PROVE THAT

01:32:14.829 --> 01:32:16.964
IT'S WORKING WILL PUT IT TO

01:32:17.031 --> 01:32:18.332
ANOTHER PROGRAM THAT DOES SHOW.

01:32:18.399 --> 01:32:18.966
THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY REDUCING

01:32:19.033 --> 01:32:20.134
RECIDIVISM AND I KNOW THAT'S A

01:32:20.201 --> 01:32:21.202
DISCUSSION I HAD WITH MY

01:32:21.269 --> 01:32:23.905
COLLEAGUES UP HERE WITH THAT

01:32:23.971 --> 01:32:24.505
WILL MOVE TO MISS COME LONGER

01:32:24.572 --> 01:32:25.973
TOUGH.

01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:27.975
THANK YOU SO -- YOU KNOW THIS

01:32:28.042 --> 01:32:29.343
MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LONG DAY FOR

01:32:29.410 --> 01:32:30.878
ME BUT HE DID THIS IS VERY

01:32:30.945 --> 01:32:33.080
DISCOURAGING THERE'S SOME HOPE

01:32:33.147 --> 01:32:35.549
BUT IT'S DISCOURAGING.

01:32:35.616 --> 01:32:37.351
I ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW --

01:32:37.418 --> 01:32:38.619
YOU DON'T EVALUATE WHAT YOU

01:32:38.686 --> 01:32:40.955
DON'T VALUE.

01:32:41.022 --> 01:32:42.924
YOU KNOW AND IF WE AREN'T

01:32:42.990 --> 01:32:45.126
VALUING.

01:32:45.192 --> 01:32:47.295
CORRECTIONS AND THE PEOPLE THAT

01:32:47.361 --> 01:32:49.830
ARE INCARCERATED.

01:32:49.897 --> 01:32:50.865
THEN WE'RE ACTUALLY NOT GOING TO

01:32:50.932 --> 01:32:53.234
TAKE THE DEEP DIVES THAT WE NEED

01:32:53.301 --> 01:32:54.335
TO TO FIGURE OUT WHAT PROGRAMS

01:32:54.402 --> 01:32:55.703
ARE WORKING.

01:32:55.770 --> 01:32:57.838
I WOULD ALSO ARGUE THAT SOME

01:32:57.905 --> 01:32:59.674
PEOPLE MAY BE VERY EXCITED ABOUT

01:32:59.740 --> 01:33:02.543
RECIDIVISM RATES EITHER GOING UP

01:33:02.610 --> 01:33:04.312
OR STAYING AT HIGH RATES.

01:33:04.378 --> 01:33:06.147
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THAT MEANS

01:33:06.213 --> 01:33:08.449
THAT THOSE SYSTEMS ARE STILL

01:33:08.516 --> 01:33:09.984
RUNNING AND PEOPLE ARE STILL

01:33:10.051 --> 01:33:12.620
BEING EMPLOYED OPERATING THEM.

01:33:12.687 --> 01:33:13.688
AND SO HOW DO WE GET TO A

01:33:13.754 --> 01:33:16.023
CONVERSATION OR A PLACE WHERE WE

01:33:16.090 --> 01:33:18.326
CAN REDUCE RECIDIVISM BUT STILL

01:33:18.392 --> 01:33:19.226
HAVE.

01:33:19.293 --> 01:33:21.662
YOU KNOW ROBUST EMPLOYMENT.

01:33:21.729 --> 01:33:23.164
MAYBE JUST HAVING FOLKS DOING

01:33:23.230 --> 01:33:26.000
DIFFERENT THINGS RIGHT IN I'M

01:33:26.067 --> 01:33:27.234
INTERESTED IN HOW WE GET TO A

01:33:27.301 --> 01:33:28.803
PLACE WE CAN BOTH PROTECT THE

01:33:28.869 --> 01:33:30.137
RIGHTS OF THE INNOCENT.

01:33:30.204 --> 01:33:32.673
WHILE RESPECTING THE HUMANITY OF

01:33:32.740 --> 01:33:33.541
THE GUILTY.

01:33:33.607 --> 01:33:35.176
AND YOU RESPECT THE HUMANITY OF

01:33:35.242 --> 01:33:37.044
THE GUILTY WHEN YOU'RE ACTUALLY

01:33:37.111 --> 01:33:38.879
PUTTING PROGRAMS WITHIN

01:33:38.946 --> 01:33:40.614
CORRECTIONS.

01:33:40.681 --> 01:33:43.184
AND EVALUATING THEM AND FIGURING

01:33:43.250 --> 01:33:45.486
OUT WHAT WORKS BECAUSE PEOPLE

01:33:45.553 --> 01:33:47.221
SHOULD KNOW THEIR RIGHTS THEY

01:33:47.288 --> 01:33:48.489
SHOULD BE GAINING FINANCIAL

01:33:48.556 --> 01:33:50.524
LITERACY THEY SHOULD BE WORKING

01:33:50.591 --> 01:33:52.093
ON COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT.

01:33:52.159 --> 01:33:53.294
THEY SHOULD BE WORKING ON

01:33:53.361 --> 01:33:54.628
THERAPY THEY SHOULD BE WORKING

01:33:54.695 --> 01:33:56.430
ON EDUCATION AND WE SHOULD BE

01:33:56.497 --> 01:33:58.599
WORKING WITH THEM TO HELP THEM

01:33:58.666 --> 01:34:00.568
HAVE THE TOOLS THAT THEY NEED.

01:34:00.634 --> 01:34:04.839
TO INTEGRATE BACK INTO SOCIETY.

01:34:04.905 --> 01:34:06.107
THE CHALLENGE MAY BE.

01:34:06.173 --> 01:34:08.542
THAT NO [inaudible]

01:34:08.609 --> 01:34:11.812
ONE APPRECIATE FAILURE.

01:34:11.879 --> 01:34:13.514
IT'S OKAY TO ACTUALLY HAVE A

01:34:13.581 --> 01:34:14.682
PROGRAM.

01:34:14.749 --> 01:34:16.517
YOU EVALUATE IT YOU LOOK AT THE

01:34:16.584 --> 01:34:18.686
DATA THE DATA IS AS IS NOT

01:34:18.753 --> 01:34:19.987
WORKING.

01:34:20.054 --> 01:34:22.623
YOU TRY SOMETHING NEW.

01:34:22.690 --> 01:34:24.525
YOU KNOW NOT EVERY IDEA IS A

01:34:24.592 --> 01:34:26.727
GREAT IDEA BUT IF PEOPLE ARE

01:34:26.794 --> 01:34:29.730
AFRAID TO EVALUATE IT BECAUSE TO

01:34:29.797 --> 01:34:32.233
MS BAUER CANS POINT IF IT FAILS

01:34:32.299 --> 01:34:33.868
THEN YOU JUST TAKE AWAY THE

01:34:33.934 --> 01:34:35.002
MONEY.

01:34:35.069 --> 01:34:36.070
THEN OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO

01:34:36.137 --> 01:34:38.005
HAVE THESE HALF BAKED.

01:34:38.072 --> 01:34:38.906
BIG DOESN'T THE WORD I WANT TO

01:34:38.973 --> 01:34:42.643
USE HALF BAKED PROGRAMS.

01:34:42.710 --> 01:34:47.248
WHICH GOES BACK TO OT VALUING.

01:34:47.314 --> 01:34:49.316
THE CORRECTIONAL AND THE

01:34:49.383 --> 01:34:51.485
REHABILITATION.

01:34:51.552 --> 01:34:57.658
COMPONENTS OF CDC ARE.

01:34:57.725 --> 01:34:58.526
SO.

01:34:58.592 --> 01:34:59.994
IS THAT IT'S A CULTURE SHIFT IN

01:35:00.061 --> 01:35:01.295
MY MIND IN TERMS OF HELPING

01:35:01.362 --> 01:35:02.830
FOLKS UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW

01:35:02.897 --> 01:35:04.799
THIS IS A CONTINUUM RIGHT IN

01:35:04.865 --> 01:35:07.535
TERMS OF THESE CHECK INS THAT WE

01:35:07.601 --> 01:35:09.036
SHOULD ALL BE DOING TO MAKE SURE

01:35:09.103 --> 01:35:11.005
THAT WE'RE ON THE RIGHT PATH.

01:35:11.072 --> 01:35:13.240
BECAUSE YOU ACTUALLY CAN GET

01:35:13.307 --> 01:35:14.975
RETURN ON INVESTMENT.

01:35:15.042 --> 01:35:16.410
RIGHT I THINK THE ECONOMICS WORK

01:35:16.477 --> 01:35:17.678
IN THE OTHER WAY IF YOU GET

01:35:17.745 --> 01:35:19.213
FOLKS OUT.

01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:21.148
IN THEIR IN COMMUNITIES OR IF

01:35:21.215 --> 01:35:21.916
YOU'RE FIGURING OUT WHO THE

01:35:21.982 --> 01:35:22.850
RIGHT PEOPLE ARE THAT YOU SHOULD

01:35:22.917 --> 01:35:24.452
BE CONTRACTING WITH TO BRING

01:35:24.518 --> 01:35:26.320
THEM INTO CORRECTIONS AND INTO

01:35:26.387 --> 01:35:28.422
THE PRISONS.

01:35:28.489 --> 01:35:30.624
YOU CAN PROBABLY CUT COSTS

01:35:30.691 --> 01:35:32.426
BECAUSE YOUR OPERATING PROGRAMS

01:35:32.493 --> 01:35:37.031
THAT ACTUALLY INMATES MEET

01:35:37.098 --> 01:35:37.331
[inaudible]

01:35:37.398 --> 01:35:43.471
THANK YOU.

01:35:43.537 --> 01:35:44.672
THANK YOU WAS COMMANDEERED OF I

01:35:44.738 --> 01:35:46.240
BELIEVE MISTER JONES SAWYER HAS

01:35:46.307 --> 01:35:47.108
A QUICK COMMENT REALLY WILL MOVE

01:35:47.174 --> 01:35:48.542
WITH THE NATIONAL.

01:35:48.609 --> 01:35:52.012
IN YOUR REPORT -- YOU SAID THAT --

01:35:52.079 --> 01:35:54.849
BASICALLY -- AS FAR AS THE

01:35:54.915 --> 01:35:56.784
BUDGET IS CONCERNED FOR PEOPLE

01:35:56.851 --> 01:35:57.685
WHO ARE EMPLOYED IN

01:35:57.751 --> 01:35:59.386
REHABILITATION MONIES YOU NEED

01:35:59.453 --> 01:36:00.521
TO CONTINUE REHABILITATION

01:36:00.588 --> 01:36:02.022
PROGRAMS.

01:36:02.089 --> 01:36:04.358
THAT YOU DIDN'T SEE US GIVEN AN

01:36:04.425 --> 01:36:05.793
ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATION THAT

01:36:05.860 --> 01:36:07.094
THE DEPARTMENT.

01:36:07.161 --> 01:36:10.564
HAS THE RESOURCES FINANCIALLY.

01:36:10.631 --> 01:36:12.066
I'LL TAKE AWAY THE SPACE

01:36:12.133 --> 01:36:12.566
REQUIREMENT TO THAT'S A

01:36:12.633 --> 01:36:14.368
DIFFERENT DISCUSSION. FOR RIGHT

01:36:14.435 --> 01:36:16.737
NOW -- PRETTY ON THE SPOT KIND

01:36:16.804 --> 01:36:17.972
OF PUTTING THEM ON THE SPOT THAT

01:36:18.038 --> 01:36:19.406
THEY CAN.

01:36:19.473 --> 01:36:21.442
THEY CAN MAKE THE CHANGES WITH

01:36:21.509 --> 01:36:23.210
EXISTING FUNDING.

01:36:23.277 --> 01:36:24.712
THAT'S CORRECT AS FAR AS THE THE

01:36:24.778 --> 01:36:26.580
BUDGETED AMOUNT THEY HAVE TO

01:36:26.647 --> 01:36:28.449
STAFF THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS WE

01:36:28.516 --> 01:36:29.783
FELT THAT THEY HAD SUFFICIENT

01:36:29.850 --> 01:36:32.853
BUDGET -- TO BE ABLE TO TO HIRE

01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:34.788
PEOPLE AND PROVIDE --

01:36:34.855 --> 01:36:36.390
INSTRUCTORS FOR THOSE VARIOUS

01:36:36.457 --> 01:36:38.959
PROGRAMS SO WE DIDN'T SEE A NEED

01:36:39.026 --> 01:36:41.228
FOR INCREASED RESOURCES FROM

01:36:41.295 --> 01:36:42.863
THAT PERSPECTIVE BUT FACILITIES.

01:36:42.930 --> 01:36:45.132
AS AS MUCH OF MISTER FILNER SAID

01:36:45.199 --> 01:36:46.534
THEY'VE GOT TO DO -- AND IT'S AN

01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:47.768
ANALYSIS OF ALL THEIR DIFFERENT

01:36:47.835 --> 01:36:49.236
FACILITIES AND WHAT SPACE DO

01:36:49.303 --> 01:36:51.472
THEY HAVE ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS

01:36:51.539 --> 01:36:51.972
AND WHAT ARE SOME OF THE

01:36:52.039 --> 01:36:53.707
SOLUTIONS -- THAT THEY COULD

01:36:53.774 --> 01:36:56.110
BRING FORWARD TO EXPAND -- THOSE

01:36:56.177 --> 01:36:57.945
COURSES.

01:36:58.012 --> 01:36:59.513
THANK YOU SIR.

01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:00.981
THANK YOU WITH THAT NUMBER

01:37:01.048 --> 01:37:02.750
QUESTIONS THANK YOU.

01:37:02.816 --> 01:37:04.385
FRENCH RESTAURANT HERE MEMBERS

01:37:04.451 --> 01:37:06.086
YES SIR SHARE IT.

01:37:06.153 --> 01:37:07.955
THANK YOU AND MORE THAN WELCOME

PERSPECTIVE.

01:38:25.899 --> 01:38:27.735
OF WHAT THAT IS -- I BEGAN THE

01:38:27.801 --> 01:38:30.304
DEPARTMENT WHEN IT WAS JUST --

01:38:30.371 --> 01:38:32.806
CDC IT WAS OVERCROWDED THERE WAS

01:38:32.873 --> 01:38:34.742
NO ARE THE PROGRAMS WEREN'T AS

01:38:34.808 --> 01:38:36.477
ROBUST AND THEY WEREN'T FUNDED

01:38:36.543 --> 01:38:37.344
AS THEY ARE TODAY.

01:38:37.411 --> 01:38:38.946
I SARS A CORRECTIONAL OFFICER IN

01:38:39.013 --> 01:38:41.081
THE NINETEEN NINETIES -- AND

01:38:41.148 --> 01:38:42.983
MADE MY WAY UP AND DURING THE

01:38:43.050 --> 01:38:43.917
HEIGHT OF OVERCROWDING I WAS THE

01:38:43.984 --> 01:38:45.286
CAPTAIN ON A FACILITY RIGHT

01:38:45.352 --> 01:38:46.287
ABOUT THE TIME THAT THE

01:38:46.353 --> 01:38:47.655
RECESSION HIT THE PROGRAMS WERE

01:38:47.721 --> 01:38:48.689
CUT.

01:38:48.756 --> 01:38:49.623
AND THAT WAS A PRETTY HIGH

01:38:49.690 --> 01:38:51.191
INTENSE FACILITY WITH A LOT OF

01:38:51.258 --> 01:38:52.726
NEEDS BUT THAT WHEN THE FUNDING

01:38:52.793 --> 01:38:53.927
GOT CUT FOR THESE PROGRAMS.

01:38:53.994 --> 01:38:55.796
BECAME VERY INTENSE AND IT WAS A

01:38:55.863 --> 01:38:57.931
HARD PLACE TO MANAGE FOR THE

01:38:57.998 --> 01:38:59.333
INMATES AND THE EMPLOYEES.

01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:01.702
I BEGAN WITH THE IDEA YOU KNOW

01:39:01.769 --> 01:39:03.137
AT THAT TIME.

01:39:03.203 --> 01:39:04.538
THAT -- WHEN I BEGAN MY CAREER

01:39:04.605 --> 01:39:06.340
IT WAS ALL ABOUT JUST LOCKING

01:39:06.407 --> 01:39:07.608
THE DOORS AND COUNTING -- AND

01:39:07.675 --> 01:39:09.243
HOPEFULLY WE ALL GO HOME SAFELY.

01:39:09.310 --> 01:39:10.110
BUT I CAN TELL YOU THE

01:39:10.177 --> 01:39:12.012
TRAJECTORY THAT I'VE MADE FROM A

01:39:12.079 --> 01:39:12.980
CORRECTIONAL OFFICER DURING

01:39:13.047 --> 01:39:14.748

CORRECTIONS TO WHERE I AM NOW.

01:39:16.483 --> 01:39:17.918
AS AGENCY HEAD INTO WHERE WE

01:39:17.985 --> 01:39:19.586

01:39:19.653 --> 01:39:22.056
WAS PLACED ON IN CORRECTIONS.

I BELIEVE WE ARE WHAT WE NEED TO

01:39:23.457 --> 01:39:25.526
BE IN CORRECTIONS HOWEVER.

01:39:25.592 --> 01:39:26.827
I DO NEED TO SAY THE TWO YEARS

AGO SOMETHING HAPPENED

01:39:27.961 --> 01:39:28.962
CALIFORNIA THAT I BELIEVE WAS

01:39:29.029 --> 01:39:30.331
SIGNIFICANT.

01:39:30.397 --> 01:39:31.498
THE RAMIFICATIONS OF OUR

01:39:31.565 --> 01:39:33.534

FIFTY SEVEN WAS VOTED

01:39:47.581 --> 01:39:48.682
OVERWHELMINGLY BY THE VOTERS OF

CALIFORNIA IT GAVE AUTHORITY TO

01:39:50.718 --> 01:39:52.252
THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS

01:39:52.319 --> 01:39:52.786

01:39:58.792 --> 01:40:00.661
IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE PROGRAMS

01:40:00.728 --> 01:40:02.029
BY THE PRIOR SECRETARY AND

01:40:02.096 --> 01:40:04.164
MYSELF -- WE STRUGGLED WITH IT

01:40:04.231 --> 01:40:07.401
TO DETERMINE WHAT THAT MEANT. TO

01:40:07.468 --> 01:40:09.203

01:40:09.269 --> 01:40:10.871
WE BOTH WORK IN A DAY WHEN THIS

01:40:10.938 --> 01:40:12.406
DIDN'T MEAN A WHOLE LOT.

01:40:12.473 --> 01:40:13.307
AND WE KNEW THAT THERE WAS A DAY

01:40:13.374 --> 01:40:14.675
THAT WE COULD BE BETTER AND WE

01:40:14.742 --> 01:40:15.776
KNEW THAT THERE WAS A DAY THAT

01:40:15.843 --> 01:40:16.910
WERE AT THE TIME.

01:40:16.977 --> 01:40:17.711
WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE

01:40:17.778 --> 01:40:18.946

01:40:20.714 --> 01:40:21.682
BY CORRECTIONS.

01:40:21.749 --> 01:40:22.516
THE MORE TRADITIONAL

01:40:22.583 --> 01:40:23.717
CORRECTIONAL STAFF ARGUED THAT

01:40:23.784 --> 01:40:25.619

01:40:31.792 --> 01:40:33.494
EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAM THAT'S

01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:35.329
THE ONLY WAY TO GO.

01:40:35.396 --> 01:40:36.363
NOW OTHERS IN THE DEPARTMENT

01:40:36.430 --> 01:40:37.965
THEY ADVOCATED THAT WE NEED TO

01:40:38.031 --> 01:40:39.233
GO A DIFFERENT DIRECTION.

01:40:39.299 --> 01:40:40.300

THEY ARE IN PRISON NOT SO MUCH

01:40:54.681 --> 01:40:55.716
FROM THE RELEASE BECAUSE YOU

01:42:40.254 --> 01:42:41.722
RECREATIONAL PROGRAMS CULTURAL

01:42:41.788 --> 01:42:44.191
PROGRAMS AMONG OTHERS.

01:42:44.258 --> 01:42:45.726
AND FOUND THAT THERE WAS LITTLE

01:42:45.792 --> 01:42:46.994
TO NO RESEARCH STUDIES THAT

01:42:47.060 --> 01:42:48.495
SHOWED FOR INSTANCE THAT A DOG

01:42:48.562 --> 01:42:50.397
PROGRAM.

01:42:50.464 --> 01:42:52.232
COULD BE DIRECTLY CORRELATED TO

01:42:52.299 --> 01:42:53.800
RECIDIVISM AND WE TALKED ABOUT

01:42:53.867 --> 01:42:55.135
THAT A LITTLE BIT ALREADY BUT

01:42:55.202 --> 01:42:56.537
YET WE KNOW THAT THE BONDING THE

01:42:56.603 --> 01:42:57.671
AFFECTION.

01:42:57.738 --> 01:42:59.206
AND THE CARE OF LIVING CREATURES

01:42:59.273 --> 01:43:01.308
CAN HELP CULTIVATED CHANGED IN

01:43:01.375 --> 01:43:02.943
AN INDIVIDUAL BUT ALSO ON A

01:43:03.010 --> 01:43:04.745
PRISON YARD.

01:43:04.811 --> 01:43:06.380
I HAVE WITNESSED THAT PERSONALLY.

01:43:06.446 --> 01:43:07.881
PROGRAMS LIKE THAT A VERY

01:43:07.948 --> 01:43:10.150
INNOVATIVE TO ATTACH AN ANALYTIC

01:43:10.217 --> 01:43:12.352
TO SAY THAT IT IS -- EVIDENCE

01:43:12.419 --> 01:43:14.054
BASE AND IT DOES AFFECT

01:43:14.121 --> 01:43:16.390
RECIDIVISM BUT WHAT IT DOES DO.

01:43:16.456 --> 01:43:16.990
IT AFFECTS THE CULTURE OF THE

01:43:17.057 --> 01:43:17.624
YARD.

01:43:17.691 --> 01:43:18.458
AND I HAVE WITNESSED I

01:43:18.525 --> 01:43:19.660
PERSONALLY WE HAVE FOUND NO

01:43:19.726 --> 01:43:21.194
EVIDENCE.

01:43:21.261 --> 01:43:22.229
THE MEXICAN AMERICAN OR AFRICAN

01:43:22.296 --> 01:43:23.597
AMERICAN AND NATIVE AMERICAN

01:43:23.664 --> 01:43:25.299
ASSOCIATIONS IN THESE GROUPS

01:43:25.365 --> 01:43:26.767
CULTURAL GROUPS.

01:43:26.833 --> 01:43:28.168
HAVE ANY IMPACTS ON RECIDIVISM

01:43:28.235 --> 01:43:29.703
BUT YET WE KNOW HONORING THAT

01:43:29.770 --> 01:43:31.805
SHARED HISTORY AND TRADITION

01:43:31.872 --> 01:43:32.573
GIVES PEOPLE A SENSE OF

01:43:32.639 --> 01:43:34.641
BELONGING THAT GOES DEEPER THAN

01:43:34.708 --> 01:43:36.343
ANY GANG AFFILIATION.

01:43:36.410 --> 01:43:38.312
WE FIND NO RESEARCH THAT GOING

01:43:38.378 --> 01:43:40.314
TO CHURCH REDUCES RECIDIVISM.

01:43:40.380 --> 01:43:41.648
AND YET WE KNOW THAT FAITH

01:43:41.715 --> 01:43:43.183
CREATES A STRONGER MORAL CODE

01:43:43.250 --> 01:43:44.818
THAT ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY

01:43:44.885 --> 01:43:46.086
COULD ENFORCE.

01:43:46.153 --> 01:43:47.921
I DO WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY

01:43:47.988 --> 01:43:49.289

01:43:52.826 --> 01:43:54.995
GIVING ME A FORM TO DISCUSS A

01:43:55.062 --> 01:43:56.129
MORE PROFOUND.

01:43:56.196 --> 01:43:57.197
PHILOSOPHICAL SHIP IN

01:43:57.264 --> 01:43:59.700
REHABILITATION BUT IT ALSO HAS

01:43:59.766 --> 01:44:02.269
MADE IMPORTANT TO TO EXPLAIN HOW

01:44:02.336 --> 01:44:04.938
WE HOW WE ANALYZED FOR THE

01:44:05.005 --> 01:44:07.240
METRICS HOW WE IMPROVE HOW WE

01:44:07.307 --> 01:44:08.408
AUDIT HOW WE HOLD EACH OTHER

01:44:08.475 --> 01:44:09.443
ACCOUNTABLE HOW WE HOLD

01:44:09.509 --> 01:44:11.044
OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE. TO THE

01:44:11.111 --> 01:44:12.279
FUNDS THAT ARE GIVEN TO US BY

ON THE FINDINGS OF THE AUDIT BUT

01:44:18.852 --> 01:44:19.987
ALSO SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS

01:44:20.053 --> 01:44:21.021
THAT WE'VE ALREADY PUT IN PLACE

01:44:21.088 --> 01:44:22.823
SINCE UP ON IT.

01:44:22.889 --> 01:44:24.024
WAS -- CONDUCTED.

01:44:24.091 --> 01:44:25.425
I ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT THE OUT

01:44:25.492 --> 01:44:27.127

01:44:27.194 --> 01:44:29.696
FROM TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TWENTY

01:44:29.763 --> 01:44:30.330
FIFTEEN AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS

01:44:30.397 --> 01:44:31.898
ARE CONSISTENT WITH EFFORTS

01:44:31.965 --> 01:44:33.800
ALREADY UNDERWAY WITHIN DIVISION

01:44:33.867 --> 01:44:35.569
REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS.

01:44:35.636 --> 01:44:37.004
AND MY REMAINING TIME I WOULD

01:44:37.070 --> 01:44:37.771
LIKE TO TELL YOU THAT THE

01:44:37.838 --> 01:44:39.573

SPOKE OF BRIEFLY.

01:44:44.444 --> 01:44:47.414
DEPART WITHIN PROPOSITION.

PARTICIPATED IN THESE PROGRAMS

01:44:53.820 --> 01:44:54.655
I'M GONNA BREAK DOWN WHAT THAT

01:44:54.721 --> 01:44:57.224
MEANS IN PRISON YEARS EARNED SO

01:44:57.290 --> 01:44:58.692
IN MISSING GET OUT SOONER.

01:44:58.759 --> 01:45:00.227
AND I AGREE THAT WE KNEW WE DO

01:45:00.293 --> 01:45:02.262
NEED TO ATTACH AN ANALYTIC ON TO

01:45:02.329 --> 01:45:03.063
THOSE NUMBERS ON HOW MUCH YOU'VE

01:45:03.130 --> 01:45:04.498
SAVED JUST BASED.

01:45:04.564 --> 01:45:05.799
ON THAT.

01:45:05.866 --> 01:45:07.501
ON THE EDUCATION MERIT CREDITS

MILESTONE CREDITS WHICH ARE ALSO

01:45:21.782 --> 01:45:23.984
EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS THEY'VE

01:45:24.051 --> 01:45:26.920
BEEN AWARDED 200-190-00100 AND

01:45:32.559 --> 01:45:33.694
AND THE REAR BILL HEAD OF

ACHIEVEMENT CREDITS IN THOSE ARE

01:45:35.128 --> 01:45:36.963
IN ESSENCE OUR TRADITIONAL SELF

01:45:37.030 --> 01:45:37.597
HELP SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT

01:45:37.664 --> 01:45:39.533
WE THAT WE TEND TO LABEL MAYBE

01:45:39.599 --> 01:45:41.368
NON EVIDENCE BASE BUT WE KNOW

01:45:41.435 --> 01:45:43.303
THEY'RE GOOD FOR THE POPULATION --

01:45:43.370 --> 01:45:46.073
THEY HAVE BEEN AWARDED FIFTY ONE

01:45:46.139 --> 01:45:46.707
THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED NINE AWARDS

01:45:46.773 --> 01:45:49.009

01:45:50.177 --> 01:45:51.611
OFFENDERS RELEASED FROM THE DATA

01:45:51.678 --> 01:45:53.213
PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN WAS

01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:54.047
ENACTED.

01:45:54.114 --> 01:45:55.215
ON AN AVERAGE OF HAD THEIR

01:45:55.282 --> 01:45:57.384
SENTENCES SHORTENED BY ONE

01:45:57.451 --> 01:45:58.585
HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS AND THAT

01:45:58.652 --> 01:46:00.220
THEY'RE NOT GIVEN ANYTHING.

01:46:00.287 --> 01:46:01.822
WE DON'T GIVE THESE INMATES

01:46:01.888 --> 01:46:02.456
ANYTHING JUST BECAUSE THEY SHOW

01:46:02.522 --> 01:46:03.423
UP.

01:46:03.490 --> 01:46:04.858
THEY HAVE TO EARN THEM.

01:46:04.925 --> 01:46:06.359
WE OVERSEE THEM WE MAKE SURE

01:46:06.426 --> 01:46:07.494
THEIR PRESENT.

01:46:07.561 --> 01:46:09.196
AND BUT WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT

01:46:09.262 --> 01:46:10.864
NOT EVERYONE YOU CAN'T RECEIVE A

01:46:10.931 --> 01:46:12.399
CERTIFICATE FOR ON WHAT.

01:46:12.466 --> 01:46:13.800
HOW AN INDIVIDUAL CHANGES THEIR

01:46:13.867 --> 01:46:15.569
MIND SET FOR THEIR APTITUDE IS

01:46:15.635 --> 01:46:17.471
HOW THEY COMPORT THEMSELVES

01:46:17.537 --> 01:46:18.805
DIFFERENTLY?

01:46:18.872 --> 01:46:19.973
AND THAT IN ITSELF BEGINS WITHIN

01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:21.541
THOSE PRISONERS BY TAKING THESE

01:46:21.608 --> 01:46:23.410
PROGRAMS I HAVE WITNESSED IT.

01:46:23.477 --> 01:46:24.444
I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT THE LIFE OF

01:46:24.511 --> 01:46:26.146
POPULATION FOR A MINUTE.

01:46:26.213 --> 01:46:27.380
WHEN I WAS AN OFFICER AND

01:46:27.447 --> 01:46:28.982
INDETERMINATE SENSE LIVE FOR AND

01:46:29.049 --> 01:46:30.350
MET WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF

01:46:30.417 --> 01:46:32.419
PAROLE SAY FIFTEEN TO LIFE?

01:46:32.486 --> 01:46:33.186
WHEN I WAS A CORRECTIONAL

01:46:33.253 --> 01:46:34.121
OFFICER AND EVEN THE CAPTAIN

01:46:34.187 --> 01:46:35.989
EVEN EVEN TO THE POINT WHEN I

01:46:36.056 --> 01:46:37.424
WAS A WARDEN AT S. A. T. F.?

01:46:37.491 --> 01:46:39.059
THAT SENTENCE IN ESSENCE MEANT

01:46:39.126 --> 01:46:40.560
LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE.

01:46:40.627 --> 01:46:42.496
PAROLE DATES WERE GIVEN AND THAT

01:46:42.562 --> 01:46:43.964
WAS VERY DISCOURAGING.

01:46:44.030 --> 01:46:45.298
AND THAT WAS AT A TIME WHEN THE

01:46:45.365 --> 01:46:46.900
RECESSION HIT.

01:46:46.967 --> 01:46:48.568
PROGRAMS WERE CUT.

01:46:48.635 --> 01:46:49.736
PEOPLE THOUGHT DIFFERENTLY ABOUT

01:46:49.803 --> 01:46:52.739
THE INCARCERATED AND IT WAS

01:46:52.806 --> 01:46:54.207
REALLY HARD FOR ME AS PRISON

01:46:54.274 --> 01:46:55.475
ADMINISTRATIVE GOING TELL THE

01:46:55.542 --> 01:46:56.977
POPULATION STAYING COURAGE

01:46:57.043 --> 01:46:58.912
PARTICIPATING PROGRAM.

01:46:58.979 --> 01:46:59.479
BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T GETTING

01:46:59.546 --> 01:47:00.447
DATES.

01:47:00.514 --> 01:47:02.983
SINCE 200-014-3000 LIFERS HAVE

01:47:03.049 --> 01:47:04.384
BEEN RELEASED INTO THE COMMUNITY

01:47:04.451 --> 01:47:06.219
WITH ONLY THREE POINT ONE

01:47:06.286 --> 01:47:08.188
RECIDIVISM RATE.

01:47:08.255 --> 01:47:09.456
AND I THINK THAT NUMBER ITSELF

01:47:09.523 --> 01:47:10.557
DEMONSTRATE TO THE OTHER

01:47:10.624 --> 01:47:11.591
POPULATION THAT IF YOU

01:47:11.658 --> 01:47:12.993
PARTICIPATE IN THESE PROGRAMS

01:47:13.059 --> 01:47:14.327
THE FULL BREADTH OF THEM.

01:47:14.394 --> 01:47:16.263
REGARDLESS OF WHAT IT IS THAT

01:47:16.329 --> 01:47:17.230
HOPE IS THERE AND I CAN'T

01:47:17.297 --> 01:47:18.632
EXPRESS HOW MUCH HOPE IS

01:47:18.698 --> 01:47:20.367
IMPORTANT IN THESE PRISON

01:47:20.433 --> 01:47:22.035
SYSTEMS NOT ONLY TO THE INMATES.

01:47:22.102 --> 01:47:23.603
BUT TO THE STAFF TO FACILITATE

01:47:23.670 --> 01:47:24.671
THESE PROGRAMS.

01:47:24.738 --> 01:47:26.006
ADDITIONALLY MYSELF FROM THE

01:47:26.072 --> 01:47:27.474
SECRETARY BEFORE ME HAVE BEEN

01:47:27.541 --> 01:47:29.576
EXERCISING AUTHORITY VESTED IN

01:47:29.643 --> 01:47:31.945
THIS IN STATUTE UNDER PENAL CODE

01:47:32.012 --> 01:47:32.846
ELEVEN SEVENTY D. WHICH THERE IS

01:47:32.913 --> 01:47:35.849
A PROGRAMMING COMPONENT TO THIS.

01:47:35.916 --> 01:47:37.884
AND THAT -- THIS ELEVEN SEVENTY

01:47:37.951 --> 01:47:40.187
HAS EXISTED FOR MANY YEARS BUT

01:47:40.253 --> 01:47:41.154
WE RARELY USED IT.

01:47:41.221 --> 01:47:42.556
AND WHAT THAT DOES IT GIVE THE

01:47:42.622 --> 01:47:44.090
AUTHORITY FOR THE SECRETARY

01:47:44.157 --> 01:47:45.458
CORRECTIONS TRUST JUDGES TO

REVIEW SENTENCES FOR

01:47:46.593 --> 01:47:49.296
DISCREPANCIES THAT INMATES FOR

01:47:49.362 --> 01:47:50.263
EXCEPTIONAL CONDUCT.

01:47:50.330 --> 01:47:51.398
OVER NINE HUNDRED LETTERS HAVE

01:47:51.464 --> 01:47:52.966
BEEN MAILED TO THE COURTS SINCE

01:47:53.033 --> 01:47:54.601
WE STARTED UTILIZING THIS.

01:47:54.668 --> 01:47:55.502
WE PROVIDE JUDGES WITH

01:47:55.569 --> 01:47:56.570
INFORMATION REGARDING THE

01:47:56.636 --> 01:47:59.372
PROGRAMS IN MESA PARTICIPATED IN.

01:47:59.439 --> 01:48:00.440
BUT THEY HAVE RECEIVED IN THE

01:48:00.507 --> 01:48:01.842
BENEFITS OF STAFF HAVE WITNESSED

01:48:01.908 --> 01:48:03.176
BECAUSE THEY PARTICIPATED IN

01:48:03.243 --> 01:48:04.110
THESE PROGRAMS.

01:48:04.177 --> 01:48:05.645
WE NOW SPEAK TO THEIR

01:48:05.712 --> 01:48:07.314
DISCIPLINARY HISTORY THEIR DRUG

01:48:07.380 --> 01:48:09.783
FREE HISTORY -- AND THE JUDGES

01:48:09.850 --> 01:48:11.418
HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE

01:48:11.484 --> 01:48:13.086
WHETHER TO RE SENTENCE OR NOT.

01:48:13.153 --> 01:48:14.354
CALIFORNIA JUDGES HAVE REDUCED

01:48:14.421 --> 01:48:16.189
SENTENCES IN OVER THREE HUNDRED

01:48:16.256 --> 01:48:18.124
CASES BY A COMMUNITY OF TOTAL OF

01:48:18.191 --> 01:48:19.659
NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN YEARS.

01:48:19.726 --> 01:48:20.827
AND THAT'S DIRECTLY RELATED TO

01:48:20.894 --> 01:48:22.362
THE REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS THAT

01:48:22.429 --> 01:48:24.431
ARE BEING UTILIZED FACILITATED

01:48:24.497 --> 01:48:26.299
BY THE INSTITUTIONS FIVE LIFERS

01:48:26.366 --> 01:48:28.301
HAVE BEEN RE SENTENCED BY THE

01:48:28.368 --> 01:48:28.869
COURTS FOR THIS EXCEPTIONAL

01:48:28.935 --> 01:48:30.437
CONDUCT.

01:48:30.503 --> 01:48:32.105
THE RECIDIVISM RATE FOR INMATES

01:48:32.172 --> 01:48:33.740
BEING RELEASED FROM CDC YEAR NOW

01:48:33.807 --> 01:48:36.409
IS FORTY SIX POINT 1%.

01:48:36.476 --> 01:48:37.911
THAT'S FIVE POINT FOUR PER

01:48:37.978 --> 01:48:39.512
PERCENT LOWER THAN IT WAS IN TWO

01:48:39.579 --> 01:48:42.082
THOUSAND AND SEVEN AT THE MAX

01:48:42.148 --> 01:48:43.850
OVERCROWDING IN EIGHT POINT 2%

01:48:43.917 --> 01:48:46.753
LOWER THAN IT IS PEAK IN.

01:48:46.820 --> 01:48:47.320
TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WELL THE

01:48:47.387 --> 01:48:48.255
RESEARCHER RAISE THEM IS NOT

01:48:48.321 --> 01:48:49.756
CHANGED IT HASN'T CHANGED IN THE

01:48:49.823 --> 01:48:51.691
LAST YEAR I WANT TO POINT OUT IT

01:48:51.758 --> 01:48:52.225
I THINK IT'S ALREADY BEEN

01:48:52.292 --> 01:48:54.227
DISCUSSED HERE -- IN THE PRIOR

01:48:54.294 --> 01:48:54.794
PANEL.

01:48:54.861 --> 01:48:57.030
THAT -- THAT'S BEEN STABLE EVEN

01:48:57.097 --> 01:48:59.199
THOUGH THE OFFENDERS -- THAT ARE

01:48:59.266 --> 01:49:01.368
IN PRISON NOW ARE ARE SERIOUS

01:49:01.434 --> 01:49:02.168
ABOUT AN OFFENDER'S.

01:49:02.235 --> 01:49:04.237
AND I WOULD THINK THAT.

01:49:04.304 --> 01:49:05.605
YOU KNOW YOU WOULD THINK THAT

01:49:05.672 --> 01:49:06.773
THOSE NUMBERS WILL BE GOING UP.

01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:07.908
BUT THE REMAINING STABLE AND

01:49:07.974 --> 01:49:09.542
WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO FUTURE

01:49:09.609 --> 01:49:10.977
RECIDIVISM NUMBER SO WITH.

01:49:11.044 --> 01:49:13.079
THAT WE WOULD GO DOWN.

01:49:13.146 --> 01:49:15.148
WE HOUSE INMATES -- DIFFERENTLY

01:49:15.215 --> 01:49:18.318
THAN WE DID IN.

01:49:18.385 --> 01:49:18.919
TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN A DECADE

01:49:18.985 --> 01:49:19.986
AGO ONLY A QUARTER OF OUR

01:49:20.053 --> 01:49:22.222
POPULATION WAS HOUSING OR MOST.

01:49:22.289 --> 01:49:24.124
PROGRAMMING FACILITIES ARE LOWER

01:49:24.190 --> 01:49:24.724
LEVELS ONLY A QUARTER OF THEM

01:49:24.791 --> 01:49:26.593
BECAUSE WE WERE THINKING

01:49:26.660 --> 01:49:28.128
DIFFERENTLY WE DIDN'T THINK THAT --

01:49:28.194 --> 01:49:30.130
IT MAKES COULD -- BEHAVE IN A

01:49:30.196 --> 01:49:31.431
WAY THAT THEY WILL TAKE

01:49:31.498 --> 01:49:32.766
ADVANTAGE OF THESE PROGRAMS BUT

01:49:32.832 --> 01:49:34.100
WE HAVE OVER A THIRD OF OUR

01:49:34.167 --> 01:49:36.202
POPULATION HOUSE AND OUR LEVEL

01:49:36.269 --> 01:49:38.004
TO LOWER LEVEL FACILITY SO NOW

01:49:38.071 --> 01:49:38.805
THESE POPULATIONS A THIRD OF

01:49:38.872 --> 01:49:39.572
THEM.

01:49:39.639 --> 01:49:40.840
ARE PARTICIPATED IN ROBUST

01:49:40.907 --> 01:49:42.909
PROGRAMMING AND THE POPULATION

01:49:42.976 --> 01:49:44.210
IS EXPECTED TO GROW IN COMING

01:49:44.277 --> 01:49:45.145
YEARS.

01:49:45.211 --> 01:49:47.013
FURTHER MORE IN MY POPULATION --

01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:48.748
IN OUR SHOE UNITS HAS PLUMMETED

01:49:48.815 --> 01:49:49.950
ALSO.

01:49:50.016 --> 01:49:51.685
WE USED TO HOUSE INMATES I THINK

01:49:51.751 --> 01:49:52.953
WE OVER UTILIZED ISSUE.

01:49:53.019 --> 01:49:55.422
AT ONE TIME WERE AT ABOUT.

01:49:55.488 --> 01:49:56.256
FOUR THOUSAND INMATES ISSUE IN

01:49:56.323 --> 01:49:57.390
THE TERM REALLY JUST BECAUSE OF

01:49:57.457 --> 01:49:59.192
GANG STATUS AND NOW WE HAVE

01:49:59.259 --> 01:50:00.627
LISTED EIGHT HUNDRED BECAUSE WE

01:50:00.694 --> 01:50:02.028
NOW ARE UTILIZING SOME OF THOSE

01:50:02.095 --> 01:50:03.697
SAME FACILITIES WHERE WE HOUSE

01:50:03.763 --> 01:50:05.966
SHOE INMATES. TO FACILITATE AT

01:50:06.032 --> 01:50:07.167
PELICAN BAY SOME OF THESE

01:50:07.233 --> 01:50:08.401
PROGRAMS I'M TALKING ABOUT.

01:50:08.468 --> 01:50:10.136
WE ARE THINKING DIFFERENTLY WE

01:50:10.203 --> 01:50:11.738
ARE BEING INNOVATIVE WE'RE DOING

01:50:11.805 --> 01:50:13.907
A COATING PROGRAM AT PELICAN BAY

01:50:13.974 --> 01:50:15.542
WE RECENTLY HAD A GRADUATION.

01:50:15.608 --> 01:50:17.310
SO AGAIN EVEN OUR POPULATION IS

01:50:17.377 --> 01:50:18.712
ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY SERIOUS

01:50:18.778 --> 01:50:20.046
COMBINED OFFENDERS.

01:50:20.113 --> 01:50:21.081
THE DEPARTMENT IS PROUD TO SAY

01:50:21.147 --> 01:50:23.616
WE'RE HOUSING AS MANY OFFENDERS

01:50:23.683 --> 01:50:25.251
AS WE CAN AT LOWER LEVELS.

01:50:25.318 --> 01:50:26.920
AT A RELATED -- AND RELATED AND

01:50:26.987 --> 01:50:28.521
THAT -- THESE MASSIVE CHANGES IN

01:50:28.588 --> 01:50:30.223
HOUSING CLASSIFICATION ACCESS TO

01:50:30.290 --> 01:50:32.359
JOBS AND PROGRAMS WE REALLY ICE

01:50:32.425 --> 01:50:34.094
WE REALLY CAN'T ISOLATE THE

01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:35.829
AFFECTS OF HOW WE'RE ABLE TO DO

01:50:35.895 --> 01:50:38.598
THIS SUCCESSFULLY ON ONE PROGRAM

01:50:38.665 --> 01:50:39.866
EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMMING.

01:50:39.933 --> 01:50:41.601
IT'S IT'S IT'S JUST A BREATH OF

01:50:41.668 --> 01:50:42.669
THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE OUT THERE

01:50:42.736 --> 01:50:44.337
THAT WE SEE THE SUCCESS THAT

01:50:44.404 --> 01:50:46.306
WE'RE WITNESSING INSIDE PRISON.

01:50:46.373 --> 01:50:47.707
THE AUDITOR DID PUT OUT A REPORT

01:50:47.774 --> 01:50:49.743
THAT IS VERY CRITICAL ON HOW WE

01:50:49.809 --> 01:50:53.813
ARE NOT -- BEING AS BEING AS

01:50:53.880 --> 01:50:55.448
ACCOUNTABLE TO THIS COMMITTEE

01:50:55.515 --> 01:50:56.549
INTO THE LEGISLATURE OF THE

01:50:56.616 --> 01:50:57.851
FUNDING GIVEN TO US.

01:50:57.917 --> 01:50:59.652
AND MR SHOES IT IS GOING TO

01:50:59.719 --> 01:51:01.388
ILLUSTRATE AND TALK ABOUT WHAT

01:51:01.454 --> 01:51:02.522
WE ARE DOING.

01:51:02.589 --> 01:51:03.556
BUT I CAN SAY IF ANY OF THOSE

01:51:03.623 --> 01:51:04.924
OVERSIGHT THROUGH THE AUDIT

01:51:04.991 --> 01:51:06.393
WHICH WE DID TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY

01:51:06.459 --> 01:51:08.094
IT WASN'T THE FACT THAT.

01:51:08.161 --> 01:51:09.796
WE WE DIDN'T CARE THAT WE

01:51:09.863 --> 01:51:11.064
THOUGHT WE COULD JUST DO IT AND

01:51:11.131 --> 01:51:12.766
WE ARE NOT JUST THE STATUS QUO

01:51:12.832 --> 01:51:13.933
DEPARTMENT OF THE PAST WHAT WE

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:14.434
SAY.

01:51:14.501 --> 01:51:15.935
IF IT WORK FIVE YEARS AGO MUST

01:51:16.002 --> 01:51:17.670
WORK TODAY WE'RE NOT THAT AGENCY.

01:51:17.737 --> 01:51:18.638
I'VE HEARD SOME COMMENTS HERE

01:51:18.705 --> 01:51:20.040

01:51:21.641 --> 01:51:24.144
AGENCY THAN WE WERE TEN FIFTEEN

01:51:24.210 --> 01:51:25.345
AND TWENTY YEARS AGO.

BE GROWING THEM.

01:51:45.732 --> 01:51:46.232
I WANT TO END WITH THE STORY

01:51:46.299 --> 01:51:47.934
THOUGH.

01:51:48.001 --> 01:51:48.868

CONSISTENT WITH THE WORK THAT

01:54:58.558 --> 01:55:02.829
WE'VE ALREADY BEGUN -- IN LATE.

01:55:02.895 --> 01:55:03.663
TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE IN

01:55:03.730 --> 01:55:04.931
TERMS OF THE AUDIT FINDINGS

IN LATE -- TWO THOUSAND

01:55:11.771 --> 01:55:12.372
SEVENTEEN WE STARTED AS THE DOWN

01:55:12.438 --> 01:55:14.140
INTO A FACT FINDING DISCUSSION

01:55:14.207 --> 01:55:15.975
ABOUT THE PROGRAMS THAT HAD

01:55:16.042 --> 01:55:17.176
SUBSTANTIALLY ROLLED OUT.

01:55:17.243 --> 01:55:18.077
WE FULLY UNDERSTOOD AND

01:55:18.144 --> 01:55:19.646
APPRECIATED OUR RESPONSIBILITY

01:55:19.712 --> 01:55:21.247

ENHANCE THE PRISON ENVIRONMENT

01:55:22.382 --> 01:55:24.350
IMPACT PUBLIC SAFETY AND BE

01:55:24.417 --> 01:55:26.152
TRANSPARENT AND NOT WORK -- I

01:55:26.219 --> 01:55:27.754
WILL TAKE A COUPLE MINUTES TO

01:55:27.820 --> 01:55:29.322
JUST DISCUSS EACH OF THEM I'M

01:55:29.389 --> 01:55:30.690
AND AND THEN BE HAPPY TO ANSWER

01:55:30.757 --> 01:55:31.991
ANY QUESTIONS AFTERWARDS.

01:55:32.058 --> 01:55:34.160
AGAIN IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN

01:55:34.227 --> 01:55:34.927
WE SAT DOWN AS A GROUP WE

01:55:34.994 --> 01:55:35.928
STARTED A FACT FINDING MISSION

01:55:35.995 --> 01:55:37.864
TO SAY WHAT ARE ALL THE REASONS

01:55:37.930 --> 01:55:39.666
THAT -- ADMINISTRATIVELY THESE

01:55:39.732 --> 01:55:41.167
PROGRAMS WOULD NOT BE AS

01:55:41.234 --> 01:55:42.568
EFFECTIVE AS THEY SHOULD BE OR

01:55:42.635 --> 01:55:44.170
WHEN WE GO TO DO FUTURE RESEARCH

01:55:44.237 --> 01:55:45.638
WHERE THERE WOULD BE -- LACKING

01:55:45.705 --> 01:55:47.206
OUTCOMES BECAUSE OF CERTAIN

01:55:47.273 --> 01:55:48.508
VARIABLES THAT IMPACT ABOUT

01:55:48.574 --> 01:55:51.110
RESEARCH WE SAT DOWN AND REALLY

01:55:51.177 --> 01:55:52.278
WALK THROUGH EACH OF THOSE

01:55:52.345 --> 01:55:53.780
THINGS THAT OVER THE LAST TWO

01:55:53.846 --> 01:55:54.747
YEARS WE REALLY DISCUSSED THOSE

01:55:54.814 --> 01:55:56.449
THINGS -- AND WORKED ON

01:55:56.516 --> 01:55:57.650
SOLIDIFYING IN WHICH IS GOING TO

01:55:57.717 --> 01:55:58.985
BE A REPRESENTED IN THE AUDIT

01:55:59.052 --> 01:56:00.653
FINDINGS AND AND IS WHY WE ARE

01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:01.854
ABLE TO DO IT.

01:56:01.921 --> 01:56:03.790
AND A SUCH A SHORT TIME.

01:56:03.856 --> 01:56:05.058
SO IN THE FIRST TWO FISCAL YEARS

01:56:05.124 --> 01:56:06.459
WE BEGIN WORK WITH THAT P.

01:56:06.526 --> 01:56:07.860
RESULTS FIRST CLEARING HOUSE

01:56:07.927 --> 01:56:09.662
THAT WORK REALLY GAVE US INSIGHT

01:56:09.729 --> 01:56:10.797
INTO THE BROAD CURRICULA THAT

01:56:10.863 --> 01:56:11.597
WAS.

01:56:11.664 --> 01:56:12.498
ON THE REPRESENTED IN OUR

01:56:12.565 --> 01:56:13.666
CORRECTIONAL EXCUSE ME IN OUR

01:56:13.733 --> 01:56:16.135
PROGRAMS -- WE CATEGORIZE THAT

01:56:16.202 --> 01:56:17.337
WE REVIEWED IT WITH THE RESULTS

01:56:17.403 --> 01:56:18.905
FIRST CURRICULUM IT WAS RELATED

01:56:18.971 --> 01:56:19.972
TO OUR TREATMENT PROGRAMS ARE

01:56:20.039 --> 01:56:23.976
COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL TREATMENT

01:56:24.043 --> 01:56:24.510
WHICH WAS REVIEWED BY THE

01:56:24.577 --> 01:56:25.111
AUDITOR.

01:56:25.178 --> 01:56:25.778
THAT GAVE THE R. P. THE ABILITY

01:56:25.845 --> 01:56:26.412
TO UNDERSTANDING CATEGORIES HOW

01:56:26.479 --> 01:56:28.247
TO WORK WITH RESULTS FIRST TO

01:56:28.314 --> 01:56:29.982
UNDERSTAND THE IMPACTS OF THE

01:56:30.049 --> 01:56:31.784
RESULTS FIRST CLEARING HOUSE

01:56:31.851 --> 01:56:33.119
THAT IS EVIDENCE BASED ON

01:56:33.186 --> 01:56:34.487
RESEARCH TO NOT CLEARING HOUSE.

01:56:34.554 --> 01:56:35.621
AND HE GAVE US THE ABILITY TO

01:56:35.688 --> 01:56:37.290
FOCUS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF

01:56:37.357 --> 01:56:39.359
CURRICULA COLOR COLLECTION AND

01:56:39.425 --> 01:56:39.759
CASE MANAGEMENT.

01:56:39.826 --> 01:56:40.860
AND SO.

01:56:40.927 --> 01:56:42.695
THROUGH THAT EFFORT WE INITIALLY

01:56:42.762 --> 01:56:44.731
SAID OKAY THERE ARE -- BASICALLY

01:56:44.797 --> 01:56:46.132
WHAT WAS REPRESENTED THE AUDIT

01:56:46.199 --> 01:56:47.934
ABOUT 20% OF OUR CURRICULUM

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.403
WHICH HAS NOT BEEN -- EVIDENCE

01:56:50.470 --> 01:56:52.171
BASED AND RESEARCHED AND IS

01:56:52.238 --> 01:56:53.406
CONTAINED WITHIN THE FEW RESULTS

01:56:53.473 --> 01:56:54.674
FIRST CLEARING HOUSE NOW IT

01:56:54.741 --> 01:56:56.075
MIGHT BE EVIDENCE BASED IT HAS

01:56:56.142 --> 01:56:57.343
BEEN AROUND FOR DECADES IN SOME

01:56:57.410 --> 01:56:59.212
CASES BUT NIGHT MIGHT NOT HAVE

01:56:59.278 --> 01:57:00.146
JUST BEEN ANY EVIDENCE BASED

01:57:00.213 --> 01:57:01.948
RESEARCH WITHIN CLEARING -- THE

01:57:02.014 --> 01:57:03.316
RESULTS FIRST CLEARING HOUSE SO

01:57:03.383 --> 01:57:04.350
WE SAID LET'S FOCUS ON DATA

01:57:04.417 --> 01:57:05.551
COLLECTION AN EXTRACTION NOW

01:57:05.618 --> 01:57:07.053
THAT WE'VE GOTTEN THAT FIGURE

01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:08.187
BECAUSE THAT IS ONE OF THE MAIN

01:57:08.254 --> 01:57:09.756
THINGS I THINK THE DEPARTMENT

01:57:09.822 --> 01:57:10.656
HAS ALWAYS HISTORICALLY

01:57:10.723 --> 01:57:11.224
STRUGGLED WITH.

01:57:11.290 --> 01:57:14.427
IS REALLY SAYING THAT WE HAVE

01:57:14.494 --> 01:57:15.161
THE DATA AVAILABLE.

01:57:15.228 --> 01:57:16.662
WE FINALIZE THE CASE MANAGEMENT

01:57:16.729 --> 01:57:18.131
SYSTEM THAT WAS RELATED TO

01:57:18.197 --> 01:57:19.866
TREATMENT IN THE LAST TWO YEARS --

01:57:19.932 --> 01:57:21.567
ROLLED OUT ROBUSTLY AND NOT

01:57:21.634 --> 01:57:23.536
ALLOWED US TO GET INSIGHT INTO

01:57:23.603 --> 01:57:25.772
TREATMENT PLANS CASE NOTES --

01:57:25.838 --> 01:57:27.006
ENROLLMENT WITHIN OUR TREATMENT

01:57:27.073 --> 01:57:28.641
PROGRAMS TO REALLY UNDERSTAND

01:57:28.708 --> 01:57:29.809
THE IMPACT THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE

01:57:29.876 --> 01:57:31.277
WHEN WE LOOK AT ACCOUNTABILITY

01:57:31.344 --> 01:57:33.413
INFIDELITY IN THE FUTURE -- THAT

01:57:33.479 --> 01:57:35.381
CASE MANAGEMENT PLAN COMBINED

01:57:35.448 --> 01:57:37.617
WITH OUR TEAM SITTING DOWN AND

01:57:37.683 --> 01:57:39.152
DEVELOPING OR CREATING HUNDREDS

01:57:39.218 --> 01:57:40.253
OF COUNTING RULES AND BUSINESS

01:57:40.319 --> 01:57:42.054
RULES RELATED TO OUR STRATEGIC

01:57:42.121 --> 01:57:43.523
OFFENDER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.

01:57:43.589 --> 01:57:44.791
REALLY COLLECTS AT THIS POINT

01:57:44.857 --> 01:57:46.592
MILLIONS OF INMATE LEVEL DATA

01:57:46.659 --> 01:57:48.394
POINTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO US

01:57:48.461 --> 01:57:50.163
FOR FUTURE OUTCOME EVALUATIONS

01:57:50.229 --> 01:57:52.799
OUTPUT EVALUATIONS AND CONSTANT

01:57:52.865 --> 01:57:54.300
OPERATIONAL MONITORING.

01:57:54.367 --> 01:57:55.701
DON'T THE STAR THIRD THING WE

01:57:55.768 --> 01:57:57.136
REALLY FOCUSED ON WAS --

01:57:57.203 --> 01:57:58.504
PRIORITIZE PLACEMENT.

01:57:58.571 --> 01:57:59.605
THAT'S MENTIONED IN THE AUDIT

01:57:59.672 --> 01:58:01.207
REPORT A NUMBER OF TIMES RELATED

01:58:01.274 --> 01:58:02.875
TO THE WAIT LIST OR AN ACCURATE

01:58:02.942 --> 01:58:04.610
PLACEMENT PROGRAMS WE RECOGNIZE

01:58:04.677 --> 01:58:05.711
THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUR

01:58:05.778 --> 01:58:07.113
TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS.

01:58:07.180 --> 01:58:09.382
THEY HAD AN ARCHAIC PERSPECTIVE

01:58:09.449 --> 01:58:11.350
IN TERMS OF PLACING PEOPLE THEY

01:58:11.417 --> 01:58:12.118
WERE VALUABLE WHEN THEY WERE

01:58:12.185 --> 01:58:14.320
CREATED BUT WHAT IT TOOK WAS AN

01:58:14.387 --> 01:58:16.422
INDIVIDUAL ANALYSIS OF OFTEN ARE

01:58:16.489 --> 01:58:17.890
IN ME TO SIGN IN OFFICE. TO SAY

01:58:17.957 --> 01:58:19.826
WHO WAS PRIORITIZE BASED ON

01:58:19.892 --> 01:58:21.360
MEMORANDUMS THAT WE HAD SUBMIT

01:58:21.427 --> 01:58:22.328
OUR WITH THAT WE HAVE

01:58:22.395 --> 01:58:23.663
IMPLEMENTED IN TERMS OF POLICY

01:58:23.729 --> 01:58:25.698
THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE IN A SYSTEM

01:58:25.765 --> 01:58:26.866
THIS LARGE AND COMPLEX.

01:58:26.933 --> 01:58:29.535
SO IN LATE TWO THOUSAND

01:58:29.602 --> 01:58:30.169
SEVENTEEN LONG BEFORE THE AUDIT

01:58:30.236 --> 01:58:32.138
WE BEGAN WORK WITH OUR STRATEGIC

01:58:32.205 --> 01:58:33.306
OFFENDER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

01:58:33.372 --> 01:58:35.007
UPDATE THE BACK END OF THE

01:58:35.074 --> 01:58:36.175
SYSTEM IN THOSE WAIT LIST SO

01:58:36.242 --> 01:58:37.643
THAT WE ARE PRIORITIZING PEOPLE

01:58:37.710 --> 01:58:38.778
IN THE RIGHT MANNER.

01:58:38.845 --> 01:58:40.146
CONSISTENT WITH THE POLICIES

01:58:40.213 --> 01:58:42.348
THAT WE PUT IN PLACE -- AND TO

01:58:42.415 --> 01:58:43.716
RELY ON TECHNOLOGY SO THAT WE

01:58:43.783 --> 01:58:44.917
CAN START NOT ONLY RELYING ON

01:58:44.984 --> 01:58:46.986
TECHNOLOGY BUT MAKE DATA DRIVEN

01:58:47.053 --> 01:58:47.753
DECISIONS BASED ON THAT

01:58:47.820 --> 01:58:48.855
TECHNOLOGY.

01:58:48.921 --> 01:58:50.256
SO WE ISSUED IN THAT TERM --

01:58:50.323 --> 01:58:52.458
CLEAR POLICY DIRECTIVES -- IN

01:58:52.525 --> 01:58:54.427
LATE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN

01:58:54.494 --> 01:58:55.828
FOCUSING ON THOSE RISKS TO RE

01:58:55.895 --> 01:58:57.430
OFFEND AND THOSE CRIMINAL GENIC

01:58:57.497 --> 01:59:00.166
NEEDS -- AGAIN POLICY DIRECTIVES

01:59:00.233 --> 01:59:02.201
ARE ARE NOT IDEAL BECAUSE THEY

01:59:02.268 --> 01:59:03.336
DO NOT RELY ON THE TECHNOLOGY

01:59:03.402 --> 01:59:04.670
AND THAT'S WHEN WE BEGIN THAT

01:59:04.737 --> 01:59:06.739
WORK WITH THE TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS --

01:59:06.806 --> 01:59:08.608
THAT TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM THE WAIT

01:59:08.674 --> 01:59:10.476
LIST -- AS MENTIONED BY THE SEA

01:59:10.543 --> 01:59:13.446
OTTER AND IN PREVIOUS HEARINGS

01:59:13.513 --> 01:59:15.114
WENT INTO EFFECT THIS WEEK AND

01:59:15.181 --> 01:59:16.516
THAT CREATES AN AUTOMATED

01:59:16.582 --> 01:59:17.984
PRIORITIZATION FOR AWAY THE SO

01:59:18.050 --> 01:59:19.452
WE EXPECT TO SEE SUBSTANTIAL

01:59:19.519 --> 01:59:20.152
GROWTH.

01:59:20.219 --> 01:59:21.954
IN THE PLACING THE RIGHT IN MADE

01:59:22.021 --> 01:59:22.788
IN THE RIGHT PROGRAM AT THE

01:59:22.855 --> 01:59:24.590
RIGHT TIME -- THAT WILL HELP

01:59:24.657 --> 01:59:26.292
LEVERAGE ALL OF THE STUFF THAT

01:59:26.359 --> 01:59:27.894
WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON AND MAKING

01:59:27.960 --> 01:59:29.328
SURE THAT IT'S MOVING FORWARD.

01:59:29.395 --> 01:59:31.030
WE ALSO IN THIS PROCESS IN THE

01:59:31.097 --> 01:59:33.399
LAST TWO YEARS -- DEVELOPED TO

01:59:33.466 --> 01:59:34.634
DATA ANALYTICS TOOLS FOR

01:59:34.700 --> 01:59:36.302
OPERATIONAL USE THOSE DATA

01:59:36.369 --> 01:59:38.170
ANALYTICS TOOLS CAN MONITOR

01:59:38.237 --> 01:59:40.439
PEOPLE BOTH IN PROGRAMMING TO

01:59:40.506 --> 01:59:41.641
ENSURE THAT THEY'RE THE RIGHT

01:59:41.707 --> 01:59:43.042
PERSON IN THE RIGHT PROGRAM.

01:59:43.109 --> 01:59:44.443
AND THEY'RE AVAILABLE TO OUR

01:59:44.510 --> 01:59:45.344
CORRECTIONAL COUNSELORS IN THE

01:59:45.411 --> 01:59:47.547
FIELD AND WILL BE AVAILABLE IN

01:59:47.613 --> 01:59:49.081
THE NEAR FUTURE TO PRINCIPLES

01:59:49.148 --> 01:59:50.716
AND EVERYONE ELSE THAT HAS AND

01:59:50.783 --> 01:59:55.454
ONCE ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION

01:59:55.521 --> 01:59:55.855
SO THAT THEY CAN.

01:59:55.922 --> 01:59:57.223
ON THE FLY IN REAL TIME SEE HOW

01:59:57.290 --> 01:59:57.857
THEY'RE INTERACTING WITH THEIR

01:59:57.924 --> 01:59:58.824
POPULATIONS AND MAKE SURE AGAIN

01:59:58.891 --> 02:00:00.526
THAT THEY HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO

02:00:00.593 --> 02:00:01.694
HELP THEM SO THEY'RE NOT

02:00:01.761 --> 02:00:02.795
INDIVIDUALLY PULLING PEOPLE UP

02:00:02.862 --> 02:00:04.297
AND SEEING IF THERE PRIORITIZE

02:00:04.363 --> 02:00:05.331
FOR PROGRAMMING.

02:00:05.398 --> 02:00:07.366
AGAIN -- THOSE TWO DATA

02:00:07.433 --> 02:00:08.634
ANALYTICS TOOLS HAVE BEEN

02:00:08.701 --> 02:00:10.136
DEVELOPED IN THE LAST TWO YEARS --

02:00:10.202 --> 02:00:12.071
AND THEN WE ALSO -- ARE AROUND

02:00:12.138 --> 02:00:13.239
PERFORMANCE ACCOUNTABILITY

02:00:13.306 --> 02:00:15.074
INFIDELITY WAS A HEAVY TOPIC IN

02:00:15.141 --> 02:00:15.708
THE AUDIT ABOUT ADMINISTRATIVE

02:00:15.775 --> 02:00:19.145
PRACTICES WE RECOGNIZED IN TWO

02:00:19.211 --> 02:00:19.779
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THAT IF YOU

02:00:19.845 --> 02:00:20.913
DO NOT HAVE THE PROPER

02:00:20.980 --> 02:00:21.714
ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURES AND

02:00:21.781 --> 02:00:22.481
SITE.

02:00:22.548 --> 02:00:23.449
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO

02:00:23.516 --> 02:00:24.984
MEASURE IT AND IT OFTEN IMPACTS

02:00:25.051 --> 02:00:26.485
RECIDIVISM ESPECIALLY AS IT

02:00:26.552 --> 02:00:28.020
RELATES TO FIDELITY.

02:00:28.087 --> 02:00:29.755
WE BEGAN WORK -- I STATED IN THE

02:00:29.822 --> 02:00:32.625
AUDIT -- IN TWO THOUSAND

02:00:32.692 --> 02:00:33.192
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WITH THE

02:00:33.259 --> 02:00:34.327
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE

02:00:34.393 --> 02:00:36.462
TO CREATE TWO TOOLS THOSE TOOLS

02:00:36.529 --> 02:00:37.997
ARE OUR PROGRAM ACCOUNTABILITY

02:00:38.064 --> 02:00:40.232
REVIEW TOOL -- WHICH ESSENTIALLY

02:00:40.299 --> 02:00:42.368
MONITORS CONTRACT COMPLIANCE --

02:00:42.435 --> 02:00:44.170
AT THE VERY MINUTE LEVEL THAT IS

02:00:44.236 --> 02:00:45.504
ONLY ABLE TO BE ACCOMPLISHED

02:00:45.571 --> 02:00:46.806
BECAUSE OF THE CASE MANAGEMENT

02:00:46.872 --> 02:00:47.940
SYSTEM WE ARE ALSO ROLLING OUT

02:00:48.007 --> 02:00:49.742
AT THE SAME TIME AND OUR DATA

02:00:49.809 --> 02:00:50.576
COLLECTION EFFORTS SO WE KNOW

02:00:50.643 --> 02:00:52.178
THAT THESE -- ITEMS ARE ALL

02:00:52.244 --> 02:00:53.813
INTERTWINED AND ARE PART OF THE

02:00:53.879 --> 02:00:57.049
SUCCESS IN THE FUTURE -- THAT WE

02:00:57.116 --> 02:00:58.250
PLAN ON DISPLAYING.

02:00:58.317 --> 02:00:59.785
THAT PROGRAM ACCOUNTABILITY TOLD

02:00:59.852 --> 02:01:02.622
WAS FINALIZED IN TWO THOUSAND

02:01:02.688 --> 02:01:04.624
AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND WE

02:01:04.690 --> 02:01:06.892
DID STAFF TRANING -- AND SOME

02:01:06.959 --> 02:01:08.594
PILOTING FOR THE FIRST COUPLE OF

02:01:08.661 --> 02:01:09.161
MONTHS AND THAT'S WHAT WAS

02:01:09.228 --> 02:01:11.030
ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED IN JANUARY

02:01:11.097 --> 02:01:12.798
OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE ARE

02:01:12.865 --> 02:01:14.500
DOING STATEWIDE ASSESSMENTS ON

02:01:14.567 --> 02:01:15.101
PROGRAM ACCOUNTABILITY AT THIS

02:01:15.167 --> 02:01:17.870
POINT -- AND WE PLAN ON DOING

02:01:17.937 --> 02:01:18.337
TWO TO THREE OF THOSE

02:01:18.404 --> 02:01:19.538
ASSESSMENTS EACH YEAR SO WE HAVE

02:01:19.605 --> 02:01:21.073
MEASURABLE MARKERS FOR FUTURE

02:01:21.140 --> 02:01:22.041
RESEARCH.

02:01:22.108 --> 02:01:23.743
IN ADDITION TO THAT WE HAD

02:01:23.809 --> 02:01:24.777
DEVELOPED WITH UNIVERSITY OF

02:01:24.844 --> 02:01:26.646
CALIFORNIA IRVINE -- PROGRAM

02:01:26.712 --> 02:01:28.481
FIDELITY MARKERS AND TOOLS AND

02:01:28.547 --> 02:01:30.216
REPORTS AND THAT IS AGAIN A

02:01:30.282 --> 02:01:31.517
PRODUCT OF OUR DATA COLLECTION

02:01:31.584 --> 02:01:32.852
EFFORTS IN OUR CASE MANAGEMENT

02:01:32.918 --> 02:01:34.987
SYSTEM THAT WE ROLLED OUT --

02:01:35.054 --> 02:01:36.188
CONCURRENTLY.

02:01:36.255 --> 02:01:37.823
THOSE FIDELITY MEASURES ARE

02:01:37.890 --> 02:01:39.725
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO THE

02:01:39.792 --> 02:01:41.427
SUCCESS OF PROGRAMMING IF THE

02:01:41.494 --> 02:01:43.062
THERE'S NO EFFICACY TO THE

02:01:43.129 --> 02:01:44.830
PROGRAM IT'S NOT BEING INTENDED --

02:01:44.897 --> 02:01:46.198
IT'S NOT BEING IMPLEMENTED AS IT

02:01:46.265 --> 02:01:47.900
WAS INTENDED WE KNOW THAT THERE

02:01:47.967 --> 02:01:50.136
ARE JUST BEAR IMPACTS AND

02:01:50.202 --> 02:01:52.838
ULTIMATELY AFFECTS ON RECIDIVISM.

02:01:52.905 --> 02:01:55.041
SO ALL OF THOSE THINGS REALLY

02:01:55.107 --> 02:01:56.108
ADDRESS A LOT OF WHAT THE

02:01:56.175 --> 02:01:58.344
AUDITOR -- RECKON -- RECOMMENDS

02:01:58.411 --> 02:01:58.878
AND THOSE ARE SOME OF THE

02:01:58.944 --> 02:02:00.012
RESPONSES WE'VE DEVELOPED

02:02:00.079 --> 02:02:02.014
ADDITIONALLY WE'VE DEVELOPED

02:02:02.081 --> 02:02:03.582
WEEKLY BASED ON THOSE DATA

02:02:03.649 --> 02:02:04.850
POINTS AND A CASE MANAGEMENT

02:02:04.917 --> 02:02:06.185
SYSTEM WE DEVELOPED A WEEKLY

02:02:06.252 --> 02:02:07.386
OPERATIONAL REPORTS SO THAT WE

02:02:07.453 --> 02:02:08.821
CAN MAKE REAL TIME DECISIONS ON

02:02:08.888 --> 02:02:10.289
PLACES WHERE THERE'S LACKING

02:02:10.356 --> 02:02:11.090
ENROLLMENT.

02:02:11.157 --> 02:02:12.892
OR LOWER CAPACITY WE HAVE

02:02:12.958 --> 02:02:14.660
MONTHLY OPERATIONAL REPORTS THAT

02:02:14.727 --> 02:02:16.495
WE NOW SEND OUT -- AND THAT HAVE

02:02:16.562 --> 02:02:18.464
DEVELOPED THAT DEAL WITH --

02:02:18.531 --> 02:02:20.466
ATTENDANCE -- COULD PERCENTAGES

02:02:20.533 --> 02:02:22.501
WE NEED TO WE HAVE GOALS AND

02:02:22.568 --> 02:02:24.270
MARKERS RELATED COMPLETIONS

02:02:24.336 --> 02:02:25.404
GOALS AND MARKERS RELATED TO

02:02:25.471 --> 02:02:26.706
ENROLLMENT ALL OF THOSE THINGS

02:02:26.772 --> 02:02:28.074
ARE DEVELOPED IN IN PLACE AND

02:02:28.140 --> 02:02:29.141
HAVE BEEN IN PLACE.

02:02:29.208 --> 02:02:31.310
NOW FOR A YEAR THE AUDITOR --

02:02:31.377 --> 02:02:32.778
HAD MENTIONED THAT WE HAD NOT

02:02:32.845 --> 02:02:34.814
FORMALLY DEVELOPED --

02:02:34.880 --> 02:02:37.650
PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND WE HAVE --

02:02:37.717 --> 02:02:39.085
IN TERMS OF ATTENDANCE

02:02:39.151 --> 02:02:40.653
COMPLETIONS ENROLLMENTS THOSE

02:02:40.720 --> 02:02:41.854
TYPES OF THINGS ARE NOW IN OUR

02:02:41.921 --> 02:02:43.589
MONTHLY REPORTS AND THEY HAVE

02:02:43.656 --> 02:02:45.157
BEEN INFORMALLY WELL WE HAVEN'T

02:02:45.224 --> 02:02:46.358
DEVELOPED IN WHAT WE PLAN ON

02:02:46.425 --> 02:02:47.827
DEVELOPING WITH RESEARCH IS

02:02:47.893 --> 02:02:48.694
REALLY MAKING THOSE DATA DRIVEN

02:02:48.761 --> 02:02:49.462
DECISIONS.

02:02:49.528 --> 02:02:51.163
ON RECIDIVISM REDUCTIONS THAT'S

02:02:51.230 --> 02:02:52.531
SOMETHING I THINK WE STILL HAVE

02:02:52.598 --> 02:02:53.332
TO WORK ON TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:02:53.399 --> 02:02:55.167
WERE APPROPRIATELY FINING THOSE

02:02:55.234 --> 02:02:57.336
MARKERS -- AND THEN FINALLY THE

02:02:57.403 --> 02:02:59.205
RESEARCH IT'S A BIG TOPIC WE

02:02:59.271 --> 02:03:00.773
KNEW WE WANTED TO IMPLEMENT ALL

02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:02.675
OF THESE THINGS BECAUSE OUR FEAR

02:03:02.742 --> 02:03:04.677
WAS HIRING A RESEARCHER HAVING

02:03:04.744 --> 02:03:05.644
ENOUGH QUANTITY WHICH NEEDED

02:03:05.711 --> 02:03:07.313
ENOUGH LONGITUDINAL DATA AFTER

02:03:07.379 --> 02:03:08.481
THE ROLL OUT OF THE ARE PEOPLE

02:03:08.547 --> 02:03:09.248
COMING.

02:03:09.315 --> 02:03:10.449
AND THEN HAVING THAT RESEARCHER

02:03:10.516 --> 02:03:11.550
COME BACK AND SAY WELL YOU

02:03:11.617 --> 02:03:12.985
SHOULD HAVE BEEN COLLECTING THIS

02:03:13.052 --> 02:03:14.153
OR YOU REALLY IT MIGHT BE

02:03:14.220 --> 02:03:15.654
RELATED TO THE FIDELITY AND I

02:03:15.721 --> 02:03:16.822
REALLY TO BE RELATED TO THE

02:03:16.889 --> 02:03:18.057
CONTRACT ACCOUNTABILITY.

02:03:18.124 --> 02:03:19.391
SO ALL OF THESE PIECES COME

02:03:19.458 --> 02:03:20.926
TOGETHER TO SAY AS WE HAVE

02:03:20.993 --> 02:03:22.728
ENOUGH LONGITUDINAL DATA WHICH

02:03:22.795 --> 02:03:24.330
IS STILL LIMITED AT THIS POINT

02:03:24.396 --> 02:03:25.464
WE BELIEVE THAT OUR RESEARCH

02:03:25.531 --> 02:03:26.432
UPON WILL HAVE EVERYTHING THEY

02:03:26.499 --> 02:03:27.967
NEED TO MAKE REALLY RELEVANT

02:03:28.033 --> 02:03:29.135
DECISIONS.

02:03:29.201 --> 02:03:33.939
ON PROGRAMMING AND ITS SUCCESS --

02:03:34.006 --> 02:03:35.174
SO THAT'S A IN GENERAL -- THE

02:03:35.241 --> 02:03:36.375
STUFF THAT WE REALLY FOCUSED ON

02:03:36.442 --> 02:03:37.643
I DID WANT TO GO BACK AND JUST

02:03:37.710 --> 02:03:39.044
TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE

02:03:39.111 --> 02:03:40.546
LONGITUDINAL DATA WHICH OFTEN

02:03:40.613 --> 02:03:42.314
COMES UP -- SECRETARY TIAS

02:03:42.381 --> 02:03:46.051
MENTIONED IT AND IN.

02:03:46.118 --> 02:03:46.652
TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN FIFTEEN

02:03:46.719 --> 02:03:48.788
HIS MERE BLUEPRINT WHICH WAS TWO

02:03:48.854 --> 02:03:49.822
THOUSAND TWELVE THIRTEEN TO THE

02:03:49.889 --> 02:03:50.990
THIRTEEN FOURTEEN WE HAD I HAD A

02:03:51.056 --> 02:03:54.560
BASE LEVEL OF OUR PROGRAMS IN.

02:03:54.627 --> 02:03:55.194
TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN WE

02:03:55.261 --> 02:03:56.529
EXPANDED TO TEN ADDITIONAL

02:03:56.595 --> 02:03:57.963
INSTITUTIONS FOR SUBSTANCE USE.

02:03:58.030 --> 02:04:00.633
AND IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN

02:04:00.699 --> 02:04:01.300
SEVENTEEN WE EXPANDED ALL OF OUR

02:04:01.367 --> 02:04:02.301
C. B. T. PROGRAM SO THE

02:04:02.368 --> 02:04:04.236
REMAINING INSTITUTIONS THAT WERE

02:04:04.303 --> 02:04:05.604
NOT INCLUDED IN BROUGH BLUEPRINT.

02:04:05.671 --> 02:04:07.039
AND EXPANDED C. B. T. AT ALL OF

02:04:07.106 --> 02:04:09.175
OUR PROGRAM SO IN THAT SHORT

02:04:09.241 --> 02:04:12.611
TIME PERIOD WE COMPLETELY ARE.

02:04:12.678 --> 02:04:15.080
YOU KNOW ROLLED OUT A MASSIVE --

02:04:15.147 --> 02:04:16.448
PROGRAM FOR D. R. P. RELATED TO

02:04:16.515 --> 02:04:17.950
C. B. T. TREATMENT SO SOME OF

02:04:18.017 --> 02:04:19.018
THAT COMPONENT IS REALLY WAITING

02:04:19.084 --> 02:04:20.853
FOR THE LONGITUDINAL DATA TO

02:04:20.920 --> 02:04:21.854
MAKE SURE THAT RESEARCHERS HAVE

02:04:21.921 --> 02:04:23.756
THAT THE CAPACITY. TO MEASURE

02:04:23.823 --> 02:04:27.526
BECAUSE IT'S BEEN SO -- FEW

02:04:27.593 --> 02:04:28.460
FISCAL YEAR SINCE THE ROLLOUT.

02:04:28.527 --> 02:04:29.328
AND SO THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT

02:04:29.395 --> 02:04:32.264
WE'VE DONE IN TERMS OF REALLY

02:04:32.331 --> 02:04:33.966
PUTTING IN PROCESSES IN PLACE

02:04:34.033 --> 02:04:35.568
THE RISK IN NEEDS TOOLS THAT THE

02:04:35.634 --> 02:04:37.269
AUDITOR MENTIONEDARE ABSOLUTELY

02:04:37.336 --> 02:04:38.504
RELEVANT TO OUR PLACE AND

02:04:38.571 --> 02:04:40.005
PROGRAMS WE IDENTIFIED BATHROOM

02:04:40.072 --> 02:04:41.774
SECRETARY D. AS A NUMBER OF

02:04:41.841 --> 02:04:42.474
OTHER STAKEHOLDERS IN THE

02:04:42.541 --> 02:04:43.142
DEPARTMENT.

02:04:43.209 --> 02:04:44.410
THAT ARE CURRENTLY HAVING A WORK

02:04:44.476 --> 02:04:45.778
GROUP AS THEY REFERENCE AND

02:04:45.845 --> 02:04:46.679
THEY'RE COMING BACK WITH

02:04:46.745 --> 02:04:48.480
RECOMMENDATIONS ON WHAT WE

02:04:48.547 --> 02:04:49.448
SHOULD BE DOING FOR THOSE RISK

02:04:49.515 --> 02:04:50.616
ANY TOOLS TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:04:50.683 --> 02:04:51.784
WE'RE PUTTING IN PLACE.

02:04:51.851 --> 02:04:53.652
THE SAME THING WITH -- THE SPACE

02:04:53.719 --> 02:04:55.521
SURVEY AND CONTRACTS FOR

02:04:55.588 --> 02:04:57.489
RESEARCH WE ARE ACTIVELY AND

02:04:57.556 --> 02:04:58.958
AGGRESSIVELY ENGAGING ON THESE

02:04:59.024 --> 02:05:00.426
THE SPACE SURVEYS WE ARE KIND OF

02:05:00.492 --> 02:05:02.027
CURRENTLY CONDUCTING TO MAKE

02:05:02.094 --> 02:05:02.728
SURE THAT WE ARE DOING IT

02:05:02.795 --> 02:05:03.329
CORRECTLY.

02:05:03.395 --> 02:05:04.630
PART OF WHAT WE WANTED TO AVOID

02:05:04.697 --> 02:05:06.832
IN TERMS OF A SPACE SURVEY IS D.

02:05:06.899 --> 02:05:09.301
R. P. ACTING IN A SILO WHEN

02:05:09.368 --> 02:05:10.202
THERE'S OTHER DIVISIONAL THINGS

02:05:10.269 --> 02:05:11.604
HAPPENING AND GOING OUT AND

02:05:11.670 --> 02:05:13.038
ATTEMPTING TO SAY WE HAVE A

02:05:13.105 --> 02:05:13.606
DEFICIT IN SPACE WHAT WE'RE

02:05:13.672 --> 02:05:14.573
DOING IS.

02:05:14.640 --> 02:05:16.275
AS A DEPARTMENT REALLY GETTING

02:05:16.342 --> 02:05:17.443
TOGETHER AND SAYING WE ALL NEED

02:05:17.509 --> 02:05:18.577
TO BE GOING OUT HERE WE ALL NEED

02:05:18.644 --> 02:05:19.945
TO BE ASSESSING THIS TOGETHER SO

02:05:20.012 --> 02:05:21.914
THAT WE ARE NOT HAVING A SHOVING

02:05:21.981 --> 02:05:23.549
MATCH ON WHO SHOULD BE WHERE.

02:05:23.616 --> 02:05:26.485
AND SO THAT'S ACTIVELY HAPPENING

02:05:26.552 --> 02:05:27.386
AT THIS POINT.

02:05:27.453 --> 02:05:28.053
AND WE'RE BEGINNING TO DEVELOP A

02:05:28.120 --> 02:05:29.021
PLAN OF ACTION ON HOW TO GET OUT

02:05:29.088 --> 02:05:30.389
THERE WE DO EXPECT THAT TO TAKE

02:05:30.456 --> 02:05:32.024
SOME TIME BECAUSE IT IS THE VERY

02:05:32.091 --> 02:05:33.692
LOCAL LEVEL THERE ARE THOUSANDS

02:05:33.759 --> 02:05:35.094
OF PROGRAMS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

02:05:35.160 --> 02:05:36.462
OUR ACCOUNTED.

02:05:36.528 --> 02:05:38.297
FOR BUT THAT IS BEGINNING AND

02:05:38.364 --> 02:05:39.698
THEN THE LAST THING.

02:05:39.765 --> 02:05:42.668
BUT I JUST WANTED TO MENTION WAS --

02:05:42.735 --> 02:05:44.270
THAT THE RESEARCH CONTRACTING

02:05:44.336 --> 02:05:45.771
POINTS WE HAVE BEEN HAVING

02:05:45.838 --> 02:05:47.106
CONVERSATIONS WITH RESEARCHERS

02:05:47.172 --> 02:05:48.674
BUT WE DIDN'T WANT ENGAGE THEM

02:05:48.741 --> 02:05:50.109
TOO EARLY BECAUSE GETTING INTO A

02:05:50.175 --> 02:05:51.043
CONTRACT BEFORE THEY CAN

02:05:51.110 --> 02:05:52.378
ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH THE RESEARCH

02:05:52.444 --> 02:05:54.613
WAS NOT WHAT WERE OUR INTENTION --

02:05:54.680 --> 02:05:56.348
WHAT WE DO WANT TO WORK WITH

02:05:56.415 --> 02:05:58.183
THIS COMMITTEE AND THE AUDITOR'S

02:05:58.250 --> 02:05:59.752
AN ABSOLUTELY SUBMIT ANY SCOPES

02:05:59.818 --> 02:06:00.686
OF WORK AND WE THINK THAT THE

02:06:00.753 --> 02:06:01.921
SCOPES OF WORK WILL GENERALLY BE

02:06:01.987 --> 02:06:04.690
DRAFTED -- LONG BEFORE OUR APRIL

02:06:04.757 --> 02:06:06.625
TIMELINE THAT WE HAD REFERENCE

02:06:06.692 --> 02:06:07.159
IN TERMS OF THE CONTRACT

02:06:07.226 --> 02:06:08.794
EXECUTION SO WE'RE HAPPY TO

02:06:08.861 --> 02:06:09.962
SHARE ANY OF THAT INFORMATION

02:06:10.029 --> 02:06:11.497
AGAIN SOMETHING THAT I PRIDE

02:06:11.563 --> 02:06:12.431
MYSELF IN.

02:06:12.498 --> 02:06:14.199
IS REALLY ATTEMPTING TO MAKE

02:06:14.266 --> 02:06:15.200
SURE THAT WE ARE BEING

02:06:15.267 --> 02:06:16.435
TRANSPARENT AND I'M HAPPY TO

02:06:16.502 --> 02:06:18.203
HELP -- AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO

02:06:18.270 --> 02:06:20.005
PROVIDE THE AUDITOR UPDATES WITH

02:06:20.072 --> 02:06:20.673
ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT WILL BE

02:06:20.739 --> 02:06:21.440
DOING.

02:06:21.507 --> 02:06:24.076
THAT THE LAST THING IS --

02:06:24.143 --> 02:06:25.444
SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE HAS

02:06:25.511 --> 02:06:26.512
TALKED ABOUT A BIT TODAY WHICH I

02:06:26.578 --> 02:06:29.014
APPRECIATE IS DEAR P. -- IN

02:06:29.081 --> 02:06:31.016
TERMS OF OUR CONVERSATIONS WE

02:06:31.083 --> 02:06:32.484
UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITIES OF

02:06:32.551 --> 02:06:34.553
RACISM -- RECIDIVISM ANALYSIS

02:06:34.620 --> 02:06:35.955
AND DATA LIMITATIONS AND WE

02:06:36.021 --> 02:06:37.523
RETREAT WE THINK THERE IS NO

02:06:37.589 --> 02:06:39.458
SILVER BULLET TO RECIDIVISM

02:06:39.525 --> 02:06:40.359
EVERYONE MENTIONED HERE TODAY

02:06:40.426 --> 02:06:42.094
THAT IT CREATES A LAYERED

02:06:42.161 --> 02:06:43.796
APPROACH WE MUST EDUCATE --

02:06:43.862 --> 02:06:44.964
INMATES WHILE THEY'RE

02:06:45.030 --> 02:06:46.699
INCARCERATED LAYER TIME SPRINT --

02:06:46.765 --> 02:06:48.834
SPENT IN PRISON WITHIN WITH

02:06:48.901 --> 02:06:50.369
ACTIVITY GROUPS THAT ARE LED BY

02:06:50.436 --> 02:06:50.803
OUR COMMUNITY BASED

02:06:50.869 --> 02:06:52.938
ORGANIZATIONS CONNECT TO OUR

02:06:53.005 --> 02:06:54.073
TREATMENT PROGRAMS PRIOR TO

02:06:54.139 --> 02:06:54.773
RELEASE.

02:06:54.840 --> 02:06:56.742
CONNECT IN THE COMMUNITY REENTRY

02:06:56.809 --> 02:06:58.677
RESOURCES AFTER RELEASE AND THEN

02:06:58.744 --> 02:07:00.579
ULTIMATELY CREATE COLLABORATIONS

02:07:00.646 --> 02:07:01.547
WITH THE COUNTY TO MAKE SURE

02:07:01.613 --> 02:07:02.915
THAT THERE'S LONG TERM

02:07:02.982 --> 02:07:03.749
SUSTAINABLE HOUSING AND

02:07:03.816 --> 02:07:05.217
EMPLOYMENT SO ALL OF THOSE

02:07:05.284 --> 02:07:06.185
THINGS CREATE.

02:07:06.251 --> 02:07:07.619
THE ANALYSIS THAT WERE AIMING

02:07:07.686 --> 02:07:09.355
FOR SO THAT WE CAN'T LOOK AT

02:07:09.421 --> 02:07:12.091
SOMETHING -- IN A TARGET WE CAN

02:07:12.157 --> 02:07:13.258
LOOK AT IT HOLISTICALLY THIS

02:07:13.325 --> 02:07:14.793
EVERY MEETING THE INDIVIDUAL

02:07:14.860 --> 02:07:17.429
NEEDS OF THESE -- INMATES AND

02:07:17.496 --> 02:07:19.431
THEN AS WAS MENTIONED HERE TODAY

02:07:19.498 --> 02:07:21.300
THERE THE NEEDS VASTLY ARE

02:07:21.367 --> 02:07:22.501
VASTLY DIFFERENT.

02:07:22.568 --> 02:07:26.271
AND WE MUST PROVIDE THIS

02:07:26.338 --> 02:07:28.640
FOUNDATIONAL PIECES -- I I WOULD

02:07:28.707 --> 02:07:29.308
YOU KNOW HAVE MORE TO DISCUSS ON

02:07:29.375 --> 02:07:29.875
THE ON EVIDENCE BASED BUT I

02:07:29.942 --> 02:07:31.243
THINK EVERYONE HERE STATED

02:07:31.310 --> 02:07:32.144
EXACTLY WHAT I HAD ORIGINALLY

02:07:32.211 --> 02:07:32.745
WRITTEN DOWN.

02:07:32.811 --> 02:07:34.446
IT'S THAT -- THERE ARE CERTAIN

02:07:34.513 --> 02:07:35.714
PROGRAMS THAT WE BELIEVE SHOULD

02:07:35.781 --> 02:07:37.816
BE EVIDENCE BASED AND CONTAINED

02:07:37.883 --> 02:07:38.650
WITHIN THE RESULTS FIRST

02:07:38.717 --> 02:07:39.718
CLEARING HOUSE AND THOSE ARE

02:07:39.785 --> 02:07:41.253
TREATMENT PROGRAMS WE THINK THAT

02:07:41.320 --> 02:07:42.388
THE INTERVENTION OUR CURRICULUM

02:07:42.454 --> 02:07:43.889
LEVEL THAT'S APPROPRIATE FOR A

02:07:43.956 --> 02:07:44.823
TREATMENT PROGRAM.

02:07:44.890 --> 02:07:46.859
BUT I'D JUST LIKE -- MISTER

02:07:46.925 --> 02:07:48.560
JONES SAWYER NOTED WE WANNA TAKE

02:07:48.627 --> 02:07:50.095
CAUTION AND BEING TOO EXTREME IN

02:07:50.162 --> 02:07:52.064
THAT -- INTERPRETATION BECAUSE

02:07:52.131 --> 02:07:53.165
IT LEAVES OUT COMMUNITY BASED

02:07:53.232 --> 02:07:55.200
ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN

02:07:55.267 --> 02:07:56.502
WITH THE EUROPEAN THIS

02:07:56.568 --> 02:07:57.436
DEPARTMENT THROUGH THICK AND

02:07:57.503 --> 02:07:59.204
THIN WHEN THEY WERE YOU KNOW

02:07:59.271 --> 02:08:00.672
NGUYEN REHABILITATION WAS TAKEN

02:08:00.739 --> 02:08:03.175
AWAY ARE MINIMIZED -- OUR

02:08:03.242 --> 02:08:04.510
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS

02:08:04.576 --> 02:08:06.278
WERE THERE AND I GO OUT TODAY

02:08:06.345 --> 02:08:07.913
AND GET TO SEE THE IMPACTS OF A

02:08:07.980 --> 02:08:09.415
PARENT READING TO A CHILD ARTS

02:08:09.481 --> 02:08:10.582
CLASSES THAT HAVE.

02:08:10.649 --> 02:08:12.384
DIFFERENT RACES COMING TOGETHER

02:08:12.451 --> 02:08:13.352
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DESCRIBING

02:08:13.419 --> 02:08:14.987
THAT TO ME AND THOSE IMPACTS I

02:08:15.054 --> 02:08:16.688
KNOW EXIST AND THAT'S WHERE WE

02:08:16.755 --> 02:08:18.257
WANTED TO FIND WITH RESEARCHERS --

02:08:18.323 --> 02:08:19.558
IT DIDN'T IT DOESN'T HAVE TO

02:08:19.625 --> 02:08:21.627
JUST BE ABOUT -- RECIDIVISM THAT

02:08:21.693 --> 02:08:22.861
IS THE ULTIMATE GOAL AND WE

02:08:22.928 --> 02:08:24.229
SHOULD BE MEASURING THAT BUT

02:08:24.296 --> 02:08:25.330
WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE LOCAL

02:08:25.397 --> 02:08:27.166
LEVEL HOW ARE THEY OUTPUTTING

02:08:27.232 --> 02:08:28.834
CHANGES RIGHT NOW HOW ARE THEY

02:08:28.901 --> 02:08:30.135
REDUCING RIGHT UP POWER THERE

02:08:30.202 --> 02:08:31.603
LESS VIOLENCE ON THE ARTS THOSE

02:08:31.670 --> 02:08:32.971
ARE ALL THINGS WE BELIEVE WE CAN

02:08:33.038 --> 02:08:33.238
MEASURE.

02:08:33.305 --> 02:08:34.706
WE BELIEVE THAT -- THESE

02:08:34.773 --> 02:08:35.974
PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDING

02:08:36.041 --> 02:08:37.676
SUBSTANTIAL BENEFIT TO THE THE

02:08:37.743 --> 02:08:39.645
POPULATION -- THANK YOU FOR

02:08:39.711 --> 02:08:40.646
ALLOWING ME TO TAKE THE TIME TO

02:08:40.712 --> 02:08:42.014
DISCUSS THESE THINGS -- I'M

02:08:42.081 --> 02:08:43.649
HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY SPECIFIC

02:08:43.715 --> 02:08:45.150
QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE AUDIT

02:08:45.217 --> 02:08:49.588
OR THINGS THAT WERE IMPLEMENTING

02:08:49.655 --> 02:08:50.355
THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED.

02:08:50.422 --> 02:08:50.956
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY

02:08:51.023 --> 02:08:51.457
THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR

02:08:51.523 --> 02:08:52.091
TESTIMONY IN ON THAT LAST POINT

02:08:52.157 --> 02:08:52.891
I KNOW I'LL BE INTERESTED IN

02:08:52.958 --> 02:08:54.226
HEARING WHAT THE NEXT PANEL HAS

02:08:54.293 --> 02:08:55.894
A SAY ON SOME OF THOSE -- SOME

02:08:55.961 --> 02:08:57.162
OF THE DISCUSSION UP HERE HAS

02:08:57.229 --> 02:08:59.064
BEEN YOU KNOW THE DISTINCTIONS

02:08:59.131 --> 02:08:59.798
BETWEEN ALL THE DIFFERENT

02:08:59.865 --> 02:09:02.267
PROGRAMS A CVT PROGRAMS AND THEN.

02:09:02.334 --> 02:09:03.302
SOME OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT

02:09:03.368 --> 02:09:05.337
WE'VE ALREADY MENTIONED -- NOT

02:09:05.404 --> 02:09:06.972
WITHSTANDING THAT AT FIRST OF

02:09:07.039 --> 02:09:08.574
QUESTIONS I'D LIKE TO ASK JUST

02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:11.577
KIND OF BASED OFF THE AUDITOR'S

02:09:11.643 --> 02:09:12.177
PRESENTATION AND MAYBE WE JUST

02:09:12.244 --> 02:09:13.045
START.

02:09:13.112 --> 02:09:14.480
START THERE KNOWING THAT THERE'S

02:09:14.546 --> 02:09:15.314
A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ALL THE

02:09:15.380 --> 02:09:16.515
PROGRAMS AND HOW WE ACTUALLY

02:09:16.582 --> 02:09:18.317
MEASURE THOSE OUTCOMES BUT LIKE

02:09:18.383 --> 02:09:20.919
YOU SAID A CHILD.

02:09:20.986 --> 02:09:22.688
READING TOO I MEAN -- A FORMER

02:09:22.754 --> 02:09:24.623
INCARCERATED INDIVIDUAL EADING

02:09:24.690 --> 02:09:25.991
TO THEIR CHILD YOU KNOW THERE BE

02:09:26.058 --> 02:09:28.060
A METRIC THERE TO SHOW THAT THEY

02:09:28.127 --> 02:09:29.328
DID NOT GO BACK INTO PRISON.

02:09:29.394 --> 02:09:31.096
AS WELL AND I THINK THAT'S ONE

02:09:31.163 --> 02:09:32.397
OF THE MAIN THINGS IS.

02:09:32.464 --> 02:09:33.699
HOW?

02:09:33.765 --> 02:09:35.367
HISTORICALLY HOW ARE WE MOVING

02:09:35.434 --> 02:09:36.068
TO ACTUALLY IMPROVE THOSE

02:09:36.135 --> 02:09:37.503
ANALYTICS YOU KNOW EARLIER WE

02:09:37.569 --> 02:09:39.404
HAVE TALKED ABOUT -- YOU KNOW

02:09:39.471 --> 02:09:43.175
COMPASS AND CS ARE A BUT WHAT IS

02:09:43.242 --> 02:09:44.843
PART IT MOVING AND I APPRECIATE

02:09:44.910 --> 02:09:45.744
YOUR COMMENTS SAYING YOU KNOW

02:09:45.811 --> 02:09:47.312
THIS ISN'T SAME DEPARTMENT AS

02:09:47.379 --> 02:09:48.914
FIVE YEARS AGO WE'RE THINKING

02:09:48.981 --> 02:09:52.885
ABOUT THINGS DIFFERENTLY AND HOW

02:09:52.951 --> 02:09:54.286
WE'RE DOING THAT AND SO YOU KNOW.

02:09:54.353 --> 02:09:54.953
TO BE A LOT OF THE AUDIT IS YOU

02:09:55.020 --> 02:09:55.587
MAY BE DOING GREAT PROGRAMS BUT

02:09:55.654 --> 02:09:56.889
WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE ANALYTICS

02:09:56.955 --> 02:09:58.290
OR THE DATE AND ACTUALLY BACK

02:09:58.357 --> 02:09:59.324
THAT UP.

02:09:59.391 --> 02:10:00.225
AND I THINK YOU'RE HEARING FOR

02:10:00.292 --> 02:10:01.460
MEMBERS OF THE BIASES WE WANT TO

02:10:01.527 --> 02:10:02.361
JUST MAKE SURE THAT THOSE

02:10:02.427 --> 02:10:04.329
PROGRAMS ARE WORKING EFFECTIVELY

02:10:04.396 --> 02:10:05.197
WE CONTINUE THEM IN THOSE THAT

02:10:05.264 --> 02:10:05.831
ARE NOT.

02:10:05.898 --> 02:10:08.133
MAYBE WE RE THINK ABOUT HOW WE

02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:10.502
DO THAT APPROACH -- WE TO

02:10:10.569 --> 02:10:12.004
BOLSTER UP THOSE PROGRAMS THAT

02:10:12.070 --> 02:10:13.005
ARE.

02:10:13.071 --> 02:10:14.406
AND SO IF YOU COULD JUST SPEAK

02:10:14.473 --> 02:10:15.541
TO YOU KNOW GOING FROM COMPASS

02:10:15.607 --> 02:10:17.743
AND C. C. S. R. A. AND HOW WE'RE

02:10:17.809 --> 02:10:21.180
ACTUALLY DOING THAT -- I THINK

02:10:21.246 --> 02:10:22.648
THAT BE BENEFICIAL FOR US.

02:10:22.714 --> 02:10:24.416
I'LL SPEAK TO CAMPUS -- COMPASS

02:10:24.483 --> 02:10:26.885
HAS BEEN WITH AS A PART OF OUR

02:10:26.952 --> 02:10:28.921
ASSESSMENT TOOLS ON HOW WE'RE

02:10:28.987 --> 02:10:30.489
GOING TO ASSIGN INMATES. TO

02:10:30.556 --> 02:10:32.624
PROGRAMS AND WHAT WE FOUND AS WE

02:10:32.691 --> 02:10:34.226
IMPLEMENTED IT'S IT'S NOT A

02:10:34.293 --> 02:10:35.794
DYNAMIC TOOL.

02:10:35.861 --> 02:10:37.362
IT IS VERY STATIC.

02:10:37.429 --> 02:10:38.564
WHAT WE FIND IS THAT AS

02:10:38.630 --> 02:10:40.299
INDIVIDUAL STAR PARTICIPATED IN

02:10:40.365 --> 02:10:41.867
PROGRAMS FOR THE BE?

02:10:41.934 --> 02:10:43.101
EDUCATION LOCATION OR

02:10:43.168 --> 02:10:44.870
NONTRADITIONAL PROGRAMMING OR

02:10:44.937 --> 02:10:46.638
YOUR SELF HELP GROUPS.

02:10:46.705 --> 02:10:48.240
EVEN THOUGH WE HAD ACHIEVEMENTS

02:10:48.307 --> 02:10:50.442
AN INDIVIDUAL GOT EDUCATED THEN

02:10:50.509 --> 02:10:51.877
DID RECEIVE CERTIFICATES.

02:10:51.944 --> 02:10:53.378
THERE'S NO METRIC TO CHANGE WITH

02:10:53.445 --> 02:10:54.513
THE COMPASS AND WE NEEDED MORE

02:10:54.580 --> 02:10:57.549
DYNAMIC ASSESSMENT -- I WANT

02:10:57.616 --> 02:10:58.584
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE IDENTIFIED

02:10:58.650 --> 02:11:00.285
THAT NEED AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE

02:11:00.352 --> 02:11:01.753
NOT LOOKING FOR THAT TOOL.

02:11:01.820 --> 02:11:02.988
WE'RE LOOKING AT AT THE STATE'S

02:11:03.055 --> 02:11:04.489
WE'RE LOOKING AT OTHER AGENCIES

02:11:04.556 --> 02:11:06.024
ON WHAT IS THE BEST TOOL TO USE

02:11:06.091 --> 02:11:08.560
AND WHAT IS DYNAMIC AND HOW IT

02:11:08.627 --> 02:11:11.230
CAN BE MORE -- USEFUL AT THE ON

02:11:11.296 --> 02:11:12.397
A YEAR BY YEAR BASIS SO THE

02:11:12.464 --> 02:11:14.233
CORRECTIONAL COUNSELOR CAN DO

02:11:14.299 --> 02:11:15.701
ASSESSMENTS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS

02:11:15.767 --> 02:11:17.603
INDIVIDUAL INDIVIDUAL AS A GROWN

02:11:17.669 --> 02:11:19.104
PROGRESS IN THE REHABILITATION.

02:11:19.171 --> 02:11:20.706
AS THEY GET CLOSER TO THEIR

02:11:20.772 --> 02:11:21.974
PAROLE DATES AS WE GET CLOSER TO

02:11:22.040 --> 02:11:23.575
BOARD DATES ARE THEY IN THE

02:11:23.642 --> 02:11:25.677
RIGHT PROGRAM AND IT'S JUST --

02:11:25.744 --> 02:11:28.313
IT IN WHAT WE FOUND IS IT THESE

02:11:28.380 --> 02:11:30.082
ARE NOT TOOLS IN THESE ARE TOOLS

02:11:30.148 --> 02:11:31.817
THAT ARE OFF THE SHELF THAT FIT

02:11:31.883 --> 02:11:33.318
PERFECTLY WITH CDC ARE.

02:11:33.385 --> 02:11:34.553
AND THE LAST WE WANT TO DO IS

02:11:34.620 --> 02:11:35.854
GET A A TOOL OR AN ASSESSMENT

02:11:35.921 --> 02:11:37.155
TOOL AND PLUG IT IN.

02:11:37.222 --> 02:11:39.057
AND FIND OUT A YEAR LATER IT

02:11:39.124 --> 02:11:40.225
DOESN'T WORK FOR US.

02:11:40.292 --> 02:11:41.059
THAT'S WHY WE'RE TAKING THIS

02:11:41.126 --> 02:11:42.861
CAUTIOUS APPROACH WE ARE WORKING

02:11:42.928 --> 02:11:45.230
WITH -- VARIOUS OTHER WE'RE

02:11:45.297 --> 02:11:46.365
LOOKING AT OTHER AGENCIES BUT

02:11:46.431 --> 02:11:48.500
INTERNALLY WE HAVE DIVISION OF

02:11:48.567 --> 02:11:49.868
RESEARCH A DIVISION OF AUDITING

02:11:49.935 --> 02:11:51.803
AND COMPLIANCE AND THEY ARE IN

02:11:51.870 --> 02:11:53.272
THIS ALSO ALONG WITH THE VISION

02:11:53.338 --> 02:11:56.708
OF REALLY BUDGET A PROGRAM. TO

02:11:56.775 --> 02:11:58.677
FIND THAT TOOL -- WHETHER WE

02:11:58.744 --> 02:11:59.278
HAVE TO DEVELOP BETTER ON OUR

02:11:59.344 --> 02:12:00.479
OWN BUILD OUR OWN OR PICK ONE

02:12:00.545 --> 02:12:01.246
OFF THE SHELF I THINK THE MOST

02:12:01.313 --> 02:12:02.981
IDEAL IS TO MAKE IT OFF THE

02:12:03.048 --> 02:12:04.616
SHELF IN ITS PLUG AND PLAY.

02:12:04.683 --> 02:12:06.451
BUT WE FIND IS IT MAY WORK FOR

02:12:06.518 --> 02:12:07.919
THE FIRST YEAR BUT ASK

02:12:07.986 --> 02:12:09.421
CORRECTIONS EVOLVES AND AS

02:12:09.488 --> 02:12:10.789
PROGRAMS CHANGING AS WE SEE

02:12:10.856 --> 02:12:11.723
GROWTH.

02:12:11.790 --> 02:12:13.125
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE ONE

02:12:13.191 --> 02:12:16.595
IN PLACE AT ITS -- IS JUST AS

02:12:16.662 --> 02:12:17.162
DYNAMIC AS THE DEPARTMENT IS

02:12:17.229 --> 02:12:17.596
RIGHT NOW.

02:12:17.663 --> 02:12:18.730
AND HAS IDENTIFIED AS A

02:12:18.797 --> 02:12:20.332
DEPARTMENT IDENTIFIED MAYBE A

02:12:20.399 --> 02:12:22.434
PROGRAM OFF THE SHELF OR

02:12:22.501 --> 02:12:23.035
SOMETHING THAT WOULD ACTUALLY

02:12:23.101 --> 02:12:24.536
HELP.

02:12:24.603 --> 02:12:25.103
AT THOSE ANALYTICS AND DRIVE

02:12:25.170 --> 02:12:26.271
THAT DATA.

02:12:26.338 --> 02:12:28.674
I HAVE I HAVE A BRIEFING FROM

02:12:28.740 --> 02:12:31.109
THAT GROUP -- THIS MONTH -- AND

02:12:31.176 --> 02:12:32.678
THE INITIAL INFORMATION I DID

02:12:32.744 --> 02:12:33.412
RECEIVE I WASN'T SATISFIED

02:12:33.478 --> 02:12:34.813
BECAUSE THE SOUND A LOT LIKE

02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:35.681
COMPASS.

02:12:35.747 --> 02:12:39.885
IN THIS WITH A DIFFERENT PRODUCT

02:12:39.951 --> 02:12:41.920
TO YOU -- AND THEY REGION FROM

02:12:41.987 --> 02:12:43.355
THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND WE'RE

02:12:43.422 --> 02:12:45.023
VERY CAUTIOUS IN WHO WOULD BRING

02:12:45.090 --> 02:12:46.758
IN ON IT HAS TO FIT OUR MOLD AS

02:12:46.825 --> 02:12:48.660
HAS TO FIT OUR NEEDS NOT THEIR

02:12:48.727 --> 02:12:49.795
FINANCIAL NEED.

02:12:49.861 --> 02:12:51.563
CORRECT AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT

02:12:51.630 --> 02:12:52.397
WE WANT TO SEE RIGHT.

02:12:52.464 --> 02:12:53.965
NOW AS WE DRIVE TO THIS BECAUSE

02:12:54.032 --> 02:12:55.667
ONE OF THE THINGS YOU KNOW FOR

02:12:55.734 --> 02:12:57.069
MY PERSPECTIVE.

02:12:57.135 --> 02:12:58.637
YOU KNOW LIKE I SAID WE'VE THREE

02:12:58.704 --> 02:13:00.806
YEARS AGO WE DID THE SIXTY FOUR

02:13:00.872 --> 02:13:02.574
MILLION BUT FOR FOR PUTTING

02:13:02.641 --> 02:13:04.743
MONEY INTO THE ARE PART OF CDC

02:13:04.810 --> 02:13:06.812
ARE THE RE HAVE BUT THEN WHEN WE

02:13:06.878 --> 02:13:07.913
HERE WE SEE AUDIT.

02:13:07.979 --> 02:13:09.514
TALKING ABOUT EMPTY SEATS ARE

02:13:09.581 --> 02:13:11.516
UNDER UTILIZATION I WOULD CALL

02:13:11.583 --> 02:13:12.384
IT.

02:13:12.451 --> 02:13:13.518
AND YOU KNOW THAT I'M HEARING

02:13:13.585 --> 02:13:15.721
FROM THE DEPARTMENTS WELL WE

02:13:15.787 --> 02:13:17.689
DON'T HAVE.

02:13:17.756 --> 02:13:18.990
PROGRAMS OR MAYBE IS IT I'M

02:13:19.057 --> 02:13:19.825
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS IT

02:13:19.891 --> 02:13:21.426
ADMINISTRATIVE IS A PROGRAM HOW

02:13:21.493 --> 02:13:23.261
DO WE CAPITALIZE ON THE

02:13:23.328 --> 02:13:24.730
INVESTMENTS WE MADE ON THE OUR

02:13:24.796 --> 02:13:26.264
PART AND THEN THE SECOND PART OF

02:13:26.331 --> 02:13:27.199
THAT IS.

02:13:27.265 --> 02:13:28.700
ACTUALLY SEEING THE ANALYTICS TO

02:13:28.767 --> 02:13:29.835
SAY THAT PEOPLE ARE AYE I HAVE

02:13:29.901 --> 02:13:31.336
SEVERAL RESPONSES OF AND I

02:13:31.403 --> 02:13:32.537
REALLY DON'T WANT TO COME OFF AS

02:13:32.604 --> 02:13:33.472
DEFENSIVE AND ALL THESE MAKING

02:13:33.538 --> 02:13:35.240
AN EXCUSE BECAUSE I DON'T ACCEPT

02:13:35.307 --> 02:13:36.074
THAT FROM MY PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR

02:13:36.141 --> 02:13:36.808
ME.

02:13:36.875 --> 02:13:38.543
BUT I CAN SAY THAT THE DATA THAT

02:13:38.610 --> 02:13:40.178
WAS USED FROM.

02:13:40.245 --> 02:13:40.812
FOURTEEN FIFTEEN THE SHIPS THAT

02:13:40.879 --> 02:13:42.114
WERE GOING ON WITHIN CORRECTIONS

02:13:42.180 --> 02:13:43.849
AND FOURTEEN FIFTEEN EVERYTHING

02:13:43.915 --> 02:13:44.816
I'VE EXPLAINED FROM.

02:13:44.883 --> 02:13:46.184
BRINGING DOWN A SECURITY HOUSING

02:13:46.251 --> 02:13:47.919
UNITS CHANGING HOW WE CLASSIFY

02:13:47.986 --> 02:13:49.888
INMATES TAKING GREATER --

02:13:49.955 --> 02:13:52.057
ALLOWING INMATES WHO AT ONE TIME

02:13:52.124 --> 02:13:52.958
WE WOULD NEVER PUT AT LOWER

02:13:53.024 --> 02:13:55.727
LEVELS -- ON YARDS THAT WE THINK

02:13:55.794 --> 02:13:56.762
THAT -- THAT THE TWO DANGERS TO

02:13:56.828 --> 02:14:00.065
BE ON THE RECOGNIZING THE GOING

02:14:00.132 --> 02:14:00.899
HOME ANYWAY.

02:14:00.966 --> 02:14:01.800
I WOULD RATHER THAN PAROLE FROM

02:14:01.867 --> 02:14:02.734
THE LOWER LEVEL FACILITIES --

02:14:02.801 --> 02:14:04.035
EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY HAVE A

02:14:04.102 --> 02:14:05.570
TRADITIONAL WRIST LEVEL THAT

02:14:05.637 --> 02:14:06.905
WE'RE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THAT

02:14:06.972 --> 02:14:08.540
THE REALITIES ARE GOING HOME.

02:14:08.607 --> 02:14:09.875
AND I NEED THEM ON FACILITIES

02:14:09.941 --> 02:14:11.943
WHERE THEY HAVE -- ACCESS TO

02:14:12.010 --> 02:14:14.446
PROGRAMS ACCESS TO LOWER -- MORE

02:14:14.513 --> 02:14:16.515
PROGRAM RICH OPPORTUNITIES BUT

02:14:16.581 --> 02:14:17.716
THE PROBLEM WAS.

02:14:17.783 --> 02:14:19.317
WE HAD POLICY CHANGES IN PLACE

02:14:19.384 --> 02:14:22.421
WE HAD -- FACILITY SHIFT IN

02:14:22.487 --> 02:14:24.256
POPULATION WHICH IN ESSENCE

02:14:24.322 --> 02:14:25.457
CREATES VACANCIES AND SOME OF

02:14:25.524 --> 02:14:27.726
THESE PROBLEMS OTHER ISSUES THAT

02:14:27.793 --> 02:14:28.460
WE HAD TO HAVE A WE HAVE WORK

02:14:28.527 --> 02:14:29.027
THROUGH.

02:14:29.094 --> 02:14:29.995
AND SO I KNOW IT SOUNDS LIKE AN

02:14:30.061 --> 02:14:31.596
EXCUSE BUT WE HAD A SHIFT IN HOW

02:14:31.663 --> 02:14:33.665
WE HOUSE WHERE WE HOUSE AND WHAT

02:14:33.732 --> 02:14:35.100
TIME WE HOUSING EVEN.

02:14:35.167 --> 02:14:35.767
THERE WERE TIMES WHEN WE DIDN'T

02:14:35.834 --> 02:14:38.270
EVEN ALLOW INMATES OUT AFTER A

02:14:38.336 --> 02:14:39.971
CERTAIN TIME.

02:14:40.038 --> 02:14:40.772
WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN CERTIN

02:14:40.839 --> 02:14:41.440
INMATES WEREN'T LET OUT OF THEIR

02:14:41.506 --> 02:14:41.673
CELLS?

02:14:41.740 --> 02:14:42.874
WHICH WAS WHICH WAS AN

02:14:42.941 --> 02:14:44.743
OPPORTUNITY FOR I HAVE MORE

02:14:44.810 --> 02:14:46.178
SPACE IN PRISONS BECAUSE FOR

02:14:46.244 --> 02:14:47.245
PROGRAMMING BECAUSE THOSE

02:14:47.312 --> 02:14:49.114
CLASSROOMS AT TRADITIONALLY ARE

02:14:49.181 --> 02:14:50.849
THERE FROM.

02:14:50.916 --> 02:14:51.516
EIGHT TO FOUR ARE BEING UTILIZED

02:14:51.583 --> 02:14:54.186
FROM FIVE TO WHENEVER.

02:14:54.252 --> 02:14:55.520
BUT BECAUSE OF SECURITY CONCERNS

02:14:55.587 --> 02:14:56.955
ON OUR AND WE HAD TO CHANGE

02:14:57.022 --> 02:14:58.990
POLICY AND THAT TOOK TIME.

02:14:59.057 --> 02:15:00.158
SO HOW DO YOU BALANCE --

02:15:00.225 --> 02:15:02.194
FULFILLING THOSE VACANCIES WITH

02:15:02.260 --> 02:15:03.762
THE SECURITY CONCERNS.

02:15:03.829 --> 02:15:05.497
RIGHT NOW THE BALANCE IS WE ARE

02:15:05.564 --> 02:15:07.098
LOOKING AT THE REHABILITATIVE

02:15:07.165 --> 02:15:08.733
NEEDS OF THE IN MAY AND WE BASE

02:15:08.800 --> 02:15:10.502
HIS CURRENT BEHAVIOR AND WHERE

02:15:10.569 --> 02:15:12.571
WE PUT HIM NOT HIS PAST BEHAVIOR.

02:15:12.637 --> 02:15:14.039
HIS CURRENT BE HERE RECOGNIZING

02:15:14.105 --> 02:15:15.507
THAT HE NEEDS A REHABILITATIVE

02:15:15.574 --> 02:15:16.508
OPPORTUNITY.

02:15:16.575 --> 02:15:18.810
THAT TOOK TIME A CULTURE SHIFT

02:15:18.877 --> 02:15:20.011
INSIDE THE PRISON FOR STAFF.

02:15:20.078 --> 02:15:21.213
AND SOME OF THE FACILITATORS

02:15:21.279 --> 02:15:23.048
ALSO BECAUSE IT IS A HUGE SEA

02:15:23.114 --> 02:15:24.816
CHANGE THAT WHY ARE YOU ALLOWING

02:15:24.883 --> 02:15:26.218
MORE INMATES OUT IN THESE

02:15:26.284 --> 02:15:28.353
PROGRAMS AT THESE TIMES.

02:15:28.420 --> 02:15:29.387
AND AS IT AT THE TIME I WAS THE

02:15:29.454 --> 02:15:31.056
UNDERSECRETARY EVEN DEPUTY

02:15:31.122 --> 02:15:32.724
DIRECTOR TELLING THESE WARDENS

02:15:32.791 --> 02:15:34.693
BECAUSE ARE GOING HOME.

02:15:34.759 --> 02:15:35.794
WE NEED TO GIVE THEM ON OUR PART

02:15:35.861 --> 02:15:37.329
OPPORTUNITY WE NEED TO GET THEM

02:15:37.395 --> 02:15:38.563
TO THESE LOWER LEVEL FACILITIES.

02:15:38.630 --> 02:15:40.298
IT TOOK TIME.

02:15:40.365 --> 02:15:41.433
IT WAS A CULTURE SHIFT WITHIN

02:15:41.500 --> 02:15:42.667
OUR PRISON SYSTEM FOR OUR

02:15:42.734 --> 02:15:44.636
WARDENS AND OUR CUSTODY STAFF IN

02:15:44.703 --> 02:15:46.671
OUR CUSTODY SUFFER MORE ENGAGED.

02:15:46.738 --> 02:15:48.840
BECAUSE THEY SEE THE CHANGE THEY

02:15:48.907 --> 02:15:50.542
SEE THAT THEY ARE TAKING PART IN

02:15:50.609 --> 02:15:52.110
THE REHABILITATIVE PROCESS OF

02:15:52.177 --> 02:15:53.812
THE IN RIGHT NOW WHICH WHICH

02:15:53.879 --> 02:15:54.012
WILL.

02:15:54.079 --> 02:15:57.182
WHICH IS LEAD TO BETTER NUMBERS

02:15:57.249 --> 02:15:58.650
UTILIZATION IN THESE PROGRAMS.

02:15:58.717 --> 02:16:00.218
I WISH I HAD MORE SPACE AND GOT

02:16:00.285 --> 02:16:00.752
TALKED ABOUT A LITTLE BIT

02:16:00.819 --> 02:16:02.754
EARLIER THE SPACE ISSUES I KNOW

02:16:02.821 --> 02:16:05.557
THERE WE DO HAVE -- ROOF ISSUES

02:16:05.624 --> 02:16:07.526
WE DO HAVE FACILITY IMPROVEMENT

02:16:07.592 --> 02:16:10.161
ISSUES AND THAT'S THE DISCUSSION

02:16:10.228 --> 02:16:11.830
THAT THAT WE ARE IN -- IN THE

02:16:11.897 --> 02:16:13.865
BUDGET DISCUSSION NOW AND THIS

02:16:13.932 --> 02:16:15.500
REALLY GEARED TOWARDS.

02:16:15.567 --> 02:16:17.335
FINDING MORE SPACE SO WE CAN

02:16:17.402 --> 02:16:18.737
PROVIDE BETTER UP REHABILITATIVE

02:16:18.803 --> 02:16:19.704
OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE WHEN THESE

02:16:19.771 --> 02:16:21.306
PRISONS WERE BUILT WHAT WE HAVE

02:16:21.373 --> 02:16:22.507
A LOT OF OUR INMATES.

02:16:22.574 --> 02:16:24.142
THE BILL FROM THE EIGHTIES TO

02:16:24.209 --> 02:16:25.877
THE TWO THOUSANDS.

02:16:25.944 --> 02:16:26.478
THE PRISONERS THAT WERE BUILT

02:16:26.545 --> 02:16:27.579
WEREN'T BUILT WITH

02:16:27.646 --> 02:16:29.014
REHABILITATION IN MIND.

02:16:29.080 --> 02:16:30.815
I I I'M FROM THAT ERA I WAS AN

02:16:30.882 --> 02:16:32.350
OFFICER DURING THOSE TIMES THEY

02:16:32.417 --> 02:16:34.219
WERE BUILT WITH SECURITY IN MIND

02:16:34.286 --> 02:16:35.253
NOTHING ELSE.

02:16:35.320 --> 02:16:36.788
YOU GOT YOUR EDUCATION CLASSES A

02:16:36.855 --> 02:16:37.989
FEW VOCATIONAL CLASSES AND

02:16:38.056 --> 02:16:39.524
THAT'S IT.

02:16:39.591 --> 02:16:41.126
NOW SOME OF OUR OLDER PRISONS

02:16:41.192 --> 02:16:42.294
THEY WERE BUILT WITH

02:16:42.360 --> 02:16:43.428
REHABILITATION IN MIND LIKE ARE

02:16:43.495 --> 02:16:45.230
SAYING CLINTON'S ARE CHINOS ARE

02:16:45.297 --> 02:16:47.232
NOR BECAUSE THAT WAS A TIME WHEN

02:16:47.299 --> 02:16:48.934
THE DEPARTMENT REALLY BELIEVE IN

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:50.001
REHABILITATION.

02:16:50.068 --> 02:16:51.336
WE DIDN'T WE WE FORGET ABOUT

02:16:51.403 --> 02:16:52.938
THOSE DAYS BUT I'M TRYING TO

02:16:53.004 --> 02:16:55.140
REMIND THE AGENCY AND THE STAFF

02:16:55.206 --> 02:16:55.740
THAT THOSE DAYS ARE STILL HERE

02:16:55.807 --> 02:16:58.009
BUT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A

02:16:58.076 --> 02:16:59.244
SPACE.

02:16:59.311 --> 02:17:00.178
AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE LEADING

02:17:00.245 --> 02:17:01.446
INMATES OUT AT NIGHT BEYOND

02:17:01.513 --> 02:17:03.181
TRADITIONAL TIMES WE HAVE BEEN

02:17:03.248 --> 02:17:04.549
ABLE TO SECURE FUNDING TO HIRE

02:17:04.616 --> 02:17:06.151
ADDITIONAL STAFF TO FACILITATE

02:17:06.217 --> 02:17:08.286
SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS IN AREAS

02:17:08.353 --> 02:17:08.920
WHERE I DON'T HAVE STAFFING IN

02:17:08.987 --> 02:17:10.255
THE EVENING.

02:17:10.322 --> 02:17:11.356
SO WE CAN FACILITATE THESE

02:17:11.423 --> 02:17:12.857
PROGRAMS.

02:17:12.924 --> 02:17:14.426
SO IS IT JUST A SCHEDULING THING

02:17:14.492 --> 02:17:16.494
IS A RESOURCES I MEAN ASIDE FROM

02:17:16.561 --> 02:17:18.330
THE CLASSROOMS BUT I'M JUST

02:17:18.396 --> 02:17:20.632

02:17:20.699 --> 02:17:25.804
VACANCIES. FOR TEACHERS AND AND

02:17:25.870 --> 02:17:26.738
WHAT ARE NOT DIRECTOR SAYS THE

02:17:26.805 --> 02:17:27.839
CAN SPEAK ON THE TEACHERS BUT I

02:17:27.906 --> 02:17:29.774
DO KNOW THAT -- ON THE

02:17:29.841 --> 02:17:30.675
VOCATIONAL TRADES THE VOCATIONAL

02:17:30.742 --> 02:17:32.210
TRADE WE DO STRUGGLE AND HIRING

02:17:32.277 --> 02:17:34.145
SOME OF THOSE -- INSTRUCTORS

02:17:34.212 --> 02:17:37.382
BECAUSE OF FORTUNATE ENOUGH --

02:17:37.449 --> 02:17:39.084
THE STATE WHAT WERE THOSE ROBUST

02:17:39.150 --> 02:17:40.151
BUILDING GOING ON SO THAT

02:17:40.218 --> 02:17:42.120
INSTRUCTORS WHO USED TO

02:17:42.187 --> 02:17:42.921
TRADITIONALLY COMING TO WORK ON

02:17:42.988 --> 02:17:44.322
OUR PRISONS.

02:17:44.389 --> 02:17:45.190
THE GORE CONSTRUCTION OUTSIDE

02:17:45.256 --> 02:17:48.727
THE MAY MAKE MORE MONEY IS MORE

02:17:48.793 --> 02:17:50.595
FLEXIBLE -- DURING THE DOWNTURN

02:17:50.662 --> 02:17:51.796
WE HAD STAFFING.

02:17:51.863 --> 02:17:53.064
BECAUSE THE THERE WASN'T A WHOLE

02:17:53.131 --> 02:17:53.565
LOT OF BUILDING FOR THE

02:17:53.632 --> 02:17:54.799
AGGRESSIVE APPROACH IN THE

02:17:54.866 --> 02:17:56.635
DIRECTION I GAVE THE R. P. IS

02:17:56.701 --> 02:17:57.802
THE RECRUITMENT EFFORTS NEED TO

02:17:57.869 --> 02:17:59.204
BE NONTRADITIONAL GOING IN THE

02:17:59.270 --> 02:18:00.405
AREAS THAT WE WOULDN'T THINK OF

02:18:00.472 --> 02:18:01.640
GOING HITTING.

02:18:01.706 --> 02:18:03.308

VOCATIONAL SCHOOL DIRECTLY AND

02:18:05.944 --> 02:18:07.078

02:18:08.613 --> 02:18:09.681
NUMBERS.

02:18:09.748 --> 02:18:11.216
THEY NEED TO BE THINKING AND AND

02:18:11.282 --> 02:18:13.652
AND GOING INTO AREAS THAT THEY

02:18:13.718 --> 02:18:15.020
TRADITIONALLY WOULD GO.

02:18:15.086 --> 02:18:18.023
AND ALSO HIRING FORMERLY

02:18:18.089 --> 02:18:19.758

WHERE VACANCIES EXIST AND REACT

02:18:32.070 --> 02:18:33.238

INSTITUTIONS TO HELP THEM THE

02:18:39.844 --> 02:18:41.980
JOB PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

02:18:42.047 --> 02:18:43.515

02:18:43.581 --> 02:18:45.884
OFTENTIMES ESPECIALLY IN OUR

02:18:45.950 --> 02:18:46.584
CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION.

02:18:46.651 --> 02:18:48.053
IT CAN SEEM VERY DRAMATIC IN

02:18:48.119 --> 02:18:49.187
TERMS OF VACANCIES BUT THERE

02:18:49.254 --> 02:18:50.622

THEY'RE IN A HARD TO FILL AREA

02:18:55.493 --> 02:18:56.861
THAT COULD LOOK LIKE A 50%

02:18:56.928 --> 02:18:58.697
VACANCY FOR OCCUR TECHNICAL

02:18:58.763 --> 02:19:00.165

SHOULDN'T BE REACTING THAT

02:19:01.166 --> 02:19:01.933
DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULD BE

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:02.801
AGGRESSIVE IN.

02:19:02.867 --> 02:19:03.835
AND RECRUITING IT JUST MEANS

02:19:03.902 --> 02:19:06.504
THAT THOSE VIEWS ARE OUT THERE

02:19:06.571 --> 02:19:08.873

ACADEMIC TEACHERS ARE ACTUALLY

02:20:11.169 --> 02:20:12.203
COVERING RIGHT AROUND I THINK

02:20:12.270 --> 02:20:14.005
10% BUT WE WANT THEM TO CONTINUE

02:20:14.072 --> 02:20:15.206
COMING DOWN.

02:20:15.273 --> 02:20:16.975
ON THE WHERE WE'VE REALLY HAD I

02:20:17.041 --> 02:20:18.810
THINK SOME HISTORICAL STRUGGLES

02:20:18.877 --> 02:20:19.310

1-516-161-7718 AND WE DID

02:20:23.815 --> 02:20:25.216
ADDITIONAL EXPANSIONS THERE SO

02:20:25.283 --> 02:20:26.284
WHEN YOU ADD HUNDREDS OF

TREATMENT COUNSELORS INTO A

02:20:27.752 --> 02:20:30.221
SYSTEM THAT ONLY HAS SIX OR

SEVEN HUNDRED YOU'RE EXPANDING

02:20:30.889 --> 02:20:32.590
YOUR WORKFORCE FOR THIRTY OR 40%.

02:20:32.657 --> 02:20:34.058
IT DOES TAKE SOME TIME TO GET

02:20:34.125 --> 02:20:35.560
THAT HIRING DONE -- AND I KNOW

02:20:35.627 --> 02:20:36.561

TERMS OF HIRING BUT THAT'S

02:20:52.477 --> 02:20:53.645
BECAUSE WE'VE EXPANDED SO MUCH

02:20:53.711 --> 02:20:54.979
AND WE CAN STILL CONTINUE TO DO

02:20:55.046 --> 02:20:57.315
THE HIRING WE HAVE -- SO THERE'S

02:20:57.382 --> 02:20:58.850
SOME GROWTH TO DO THERE BUT

02:20:58.917 --> 02:21:01.019
EVERYTHING IS IS RANGING IN A

02:21:01.085 --> 02:21:02.320
REASONABLE RATE BUT WE HAVE

SPEAR THAT.

02:25:06.397 --> 02:25:08.566
THAT PARTY APARTMENT DON'T WANT

THIS RETICENCE TO SHOW HOW.

02:25:23.581 --> 02:25:27.151
SUCCESSFUL THESE PROGRAMS ARE.

02:25:27.218 --> 02:25:30.555
AND THE MORE MORE I ASKED FOR IT

02:25:30.621 --> 02:25:32.290
THE MORE MORE I GET NO

02:25:32.356 --> 02:25:33.991
DISRESPECT MISSUS SOSA THE MORE

02:25:34.058 --> 02:25:36.027
MORE I GET THIS WIDGET IN THING.

02:25:36.094 --> 02:25:38.629
IT DRIVES ME NUTS BECAUSE THAT'S

02:25:38.696 --> 02:25:40.298
NOT WHAT I RECENTLY ASKED FOR

02:25:40.364 --> 02:25:41.332
THE AUDIT.

02:25:41.399 --> 02:25:42.400
THAT'S NOT WHAT I ASKED FOR WHEN

02:25:42.467 --> 02:25:45.336
I MET WITH YOU.

02:25:45.403 --> 02:25:46.838

YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO GET THIS

02:26:01.853 --> 02:26:02.386
DONE BECAUSE THIS SEEMS TO ME

02:26:02.453 --> 02:26:03.888
COULD BE.

02:26:03.955 --> 02:26:06.991
FAIRLY SIMPLE. SIX GET THIS.

02:26:07.058 --> 02:26:08.392
DONE.

02:26:08.459 --> 02:26:09.760
I THINK I THINK TO BEGIN TO

02:26:09.827 --> 02:26:11.729
RESPOND -- I APPRECIATE THE

02:26:11.796 --> 02:26:13.598
CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD AND I

02:26:13.664 --> 02:26:14.999
THINK THE CONVERSATIONS FOR ME

02:26:15.066 --> 02:26:16.567
THE TAKE AWAY I HAD.

02:26:16.634 --> 02:26:18.903
AS A WE WERE SPEAKING THE SAME

02:26:18.970 --> 02:26:19.437
THING BUT JUST SAYING IT

02:26:19.504 --> 02:26:20.471
DIFFERENTLY.

02:26:20.538 --> 02:26:22.607
AND MAYBE THAT'S THAT THAT I'LL

02:26:22.673 --> 02:26:25.076
CALL OWN THAT AND THAT WE WE ARE

02:26:25.143 --> 02:26:25.877
JUST SO INGRAINED THAT THIS IS

02:26:25.943 --> 02:26:27.745
THE YOU KNOW THE MEASURE IT IN

02:26:27.812 --> 02:26:29.180
THE FORMAL RESPONSE.

02:26:29.247 --> 02:26:30.815
BUT WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS

02:26:30.882 --> 02:26:32.583
LIKE I SAID HOW DO YOU MEASURE

02:26:32.650 --> 02:26:35.052
THE SUCCESS -- AND ONE OF THE

02:26:35.119 --> 02:26:36.521
ANALYTICS ON A PARTICULAR

02:26:36.587 --> 02:26:38.656
PROGRAM TO SHOW THAT THEY DIDN'T

02:26:38.723 --> 02:26:40.091
COME BACK TO PRISON IN THIS

02:26:40.158 --> 02:26:40.858
SAVINGS FROM THAT AND THROUGH

02:26:40.925 --> 02:26:43.661
THAT SAME IS NOW WE CAN RELOCATE

02:26:43.728 --> 02:26:44.629
THESE FUNDS OVER HERE.

02:26:44.695 --> 02:26:45.730
CORRECT BUT ALSO IF THEY'RE

02:26:45.796 --> 02:26:48.232
WORKING.

02:26:48.299 --> 02:26:50.434
THE NOT RAPING PILLAGING SO

02:26:50.501 --> 02:26:53.671
ROBBING BASED BASICALLY ON

02:26:53.738 --> 02:26:55.506
OFFENSE IS EITHER.

02:26:55.573 --> 02:26:56.140
SO BASED ON OUR CONVERSATION I

02:26:56.207 --> 02:26:57.441
DID MEET.

02:26:57.508 --> 02:26:58.843
AND WE'D I DID HAVE THAT FRANK

02:26:58.910 --> 02:27:00.745
DISCUSSION THAT WE TO DO WE TEND

02:27:00.811 --> 02:27:02.813
TO GET VERY BUREAUCRATIC.

02:27:02.880 --> 02:27:04.549
AND OTHER ONE USED TO BE WERE

02:27:04.615 --> 02:27:05.683
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT WE TEND TO GET

02:27:05.750 --> 02:27:06.784
VERY BUREAUCRATIC AND I THINK

02:27:06.851 --> 02:27:07.752
IT'S MAYBE JUST OUT OF OUT OF

02:27:07.818 --> 02:27:09.654
FEAR CONCERN THAT WE'RE GONNA

02:27:09.720 --> 02:27:11.689
SAY THE WRONG THINGS.

02:27:11.756 --> 02:27:13.524
AND AND THAT'S THAT THAT'S JUST.

02:27:13.591 --> 02:27:15.226
MY STANCE SOLD MET WITH THE TEAM

02:27:15.293 --> 02:27:16.594
WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH A BETTER

02:27:16.661 --> 02:27:17.695
WAY TO EXPLAIN.

02:27:17.762 --> 02:27:18.996
WHY WERE SUCCESSFUL AND IF WE'RE

02:27:19.063 --> 02:27:21.465
SUCCESSFUL THE SAVINGS OF THE

02:27:21.532 --> 02:27:23.834
COST BENEFIT FROM THAT?

02:27:23.901 --> 02:27:25.403
WHERE WE GONNA SAY WE COULD USE

02:27:25.469 --> 02:27:26.704
IN OTHER PLACES TO ASK CAN WE

02:27:26.771 --> 02:27:28.206
USE A SOMEWHERE ELSE BECAUSE

02:27:28.272 --> 02:27:29.373
WE'VE BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL HERE?

02:27:29.440 --> 02:27:30.908
AND THE FEAR MAYBE WHILE THEY'RE

02:27:30.975 --> 02:27:32.043
GOING TO TAKE THE FUNDS THAT'S

02:27:32.109 --> 02:27:32.843
NOT OUR FAIR ANYMORE.

02:27:32.910 --> 02:27:34.178
I FOR IS THAT WE HAVE TO SHOW

02:27:34.245 --> 02:27:36.314
WERE SUCCESSFUL IS NOT ABOUT THE

02:27:36.380 --> 02:27:37.148
FUNDS BUT THE PERSON.

02:27:37.215 --> 02:27:38.816
THE IMPACT THE LESS VICTIM.

02:27:38.883 --> 02:27:40.318
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING.

02:27:40.384 --> 02:27:44.488
FOR SO FOR ME IT'S READING.

02:27:44.555 --> 02:27:46.524
I'LL RE READ NHà REORGANIZING

02:27:46.591 --> 02:27:47.825
OUR THOUGHT PROCESS ON HOW TO

02:27:47.892 --> 02:27:48.793
RESPOND TO THESE THINGS NOW

02:27:48.859 --> 02:27:49.460
THEY'RE GONNA BE TIMES WHEN WE

02:27:49.527 --> 02:27:50.394
WILL GET THE BUREAUCRATIC

02:27:50.461 --> 02:27:52.563
RESPONSE BECAUSE THAT'S YOU KNOW

02:27:52.630 --> 02:27:54.031
THAT'S WHAT'S REQUIRED AT THE

02:27:54.098 --> 02:27:56.000
TIME BUT I I TAKE OUR

02:27:56.067 --> 02:27:57.535
CONVERSATION.

02:27:57.602 --> 02:27:59.036
THE THE WILL HAVE TO RE CRAFT --

02:27:59.103 --> 02:28:00.238
RESPOND TO THAT AND WE CAN'T BE

02:28:00.304 --> 02:28:02.773
AFRAID TO SAY THIS JUST IN WORK.

02:28:02.840 --> 02:28:04.542
AND IT'S NOT WORKING WE CAN BE

02:28:04.609 --> 02:28:06.377
AFRAID BECAUSE AT LEAST WE TRIED.

02:28:06.444 --> 02:28:07.612
AND WHAT I CAN AS SHE GAVE ME A

02:28:07.678 --> 02:28:09.080
LITTLE GLIMPSE AND SO I I

02:28:09.146 --> 02:28:10.348
PROBABLY NEED TO BE SITTING

02:28:10.414 --> 02:28:11.849
WHERE YOU'RE SITTING AND LOOKING

02:28:11.916 --> 02:28:13.384
BACK AND REMEMBER WHAT THAT.

02:28:13.451 --> 02:28:15.086
WAS LIKE ESPECIALLY DURING HARD

02:28:15.152 --> 02:28:19.190
ECONOMIC TIMES BECAUSE YOU DID

02:28:19.257 --> 02:28:19.824
REAL WELL.

02:28:19.890 --> 02:28:20.825
AND YOU SAVE.

02:28:20.891 --> 02:28:21.959
MONEY ANY DEPARTMENT.

02:28:22.026 --> 02:28:23.227
THAT THE STANDARD OPERATING

02:28:23.294 --> 02:28:24.962
PROCEDURES TO SAY YOU NEED LESS

02:28:25.029 --> 02:28:26.197
MONEY IN YOUR BUDGET NEXT YEAR

02:28:26.264 --> 02:28:29.100
INSTEAD OF RE TOOLING THAT MONEY

02:28:29.166 --> 02:28:30.101
BACK YOU DEPARTMENTS YOU COULD

02:28:30.167 --> 02:28:31.736
SAY MORE TO COULD DO MORE AND BE

02:28:31.802 --> 02:28:33.604
MORE EFFICIENT.

02:28:33.671 --> 02:28:35.139
AND THAT JUST DADS.

02:28:35.206 --> 02:28:37.074
THAT'S BEEN A TIME HONORED.

02:28:37.141 --> 02:28:39.043
THING THAT'S BEEN DONE SO AT

02:28:39.110 --> 02:28:41.279
LEAST FROM OF AB SET YOUR

02:28:41.345 --> 02:28:42.847
POSITION BEING AHEAD OF A

02:28:42.913 --> 02:28:46.517
DIVISION THAT WORRIED THAT --

02:28:46.584 --> 02:28:47.752
PEOPLE WOULD CUT.

02:28:47.818 --> 02:28:49.387
BODIES IN AND RESOURCES OUT OF

02:28:49.453 --> 02:28:52.256
MY DIVISION AND SO.

02:28:52.323 --> 02:28:55.126
I I DID DID TO BE A CREDIT TO

02:28:55.192 --> 02:28:56.861
STEPS SO THAT HI HI I COULD KEEP

02:28:56.927 --> 02:28:57.695
PEOPLE ALSO.

02:28:57.762 --> 02:29:00.231
AT LEAST THAT HELP THAT HELPS --

02:29:00.298 --> 02:29:01.532
MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE

02:29:01.599 --> 02:29:04.335
COULD LEGISLATE WITH THE BUDGET

02:29:04.402 --> 02:29:05.736
AS BEST WE CAN SAVE YOU.

02:29:05.803 --> 02:29:07.838
IF YOU DO HAVE SAVINGS THAT SOME

02:29:07.905 --> 02:29:10.007
OF IT NEEDS TO GO BACK INTO

02:29:10.074 --> 02:29:11.942
CONTINUING DOING THAT'S WHY I'M

02:29:12.009 --> 02:29:15.346
TRYING YOU TO RETURN THE RETURN

02:29:15.413 --> 02:29:16.547
ON INVESTMENT.

02:29:16.614 --> 02:29:18.282
BECAUSE IN BUSINESS THEY

02:29:18.349 --> 02:29:20.985
UNDERSTAND THAT THAT IF YOU PA

02:29:21.052 --> 02:29:21.952
MORE MONEY.

02:29:22.019 --> 02:29:23.587
INTO A SUCCESSFUL.

02:29:23.654 --> 02:29:26.190
CAR LINE THEN YOU'LL MAKE MORE

02:29:26.257 --> 02:29:27.458
MONEY AND YOU'LL BE MORE

02:29:27.525 --> 02:29:29.794
SUCCESSFUL YOU CAN YOU CAN --

02:29:29.860 --> 02:29:31.562
HIRE MORE PEOPLE.

02:29:31.629 --> 02:29:32.763
THAT IS NOT THE GOVERNMENT AWAY

02:29:32.830 --> 02:29:34.999
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT SO THAT

02:29:35.066 --> 02:29:37.401
AT LEAST NOW YOU'VE GIVEN ME --

02:29:37.468 --> 02:29:39.403
A GLIMPSE OF WHAT WHAT YOU'RE

02:29:39.470 --> 02:29:41.138
SEEING A MAYBE EVEN THE FEAR.

02:29:41.205 --> 02:29:42.473
A WHAT'S GOING ON AND MAYBE

02:29:42.540 --> 02:29:44.508
THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO TO

02:29:44.575 --> 02:29:46.243
WORK ON THAT WE'RE NOT GOING.

02:29:46.310 --> 02:29:47.278
TO IF YOU HAVE SIGNIFICANT

02:29:47.345 --> 02:29:48.579
SAVINGS WERE NOT GOING TO

02:29:48.646 --> 02:29:50.114
DECIMATED APARTMENT.

02:29:50.181 --> 02:29:52.550
BECAUSE YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.

02:29:52.616 --> 02:29:54.618
AND THE AND THE IT'S THE SAME

02:29:54.685 --> 02:29:57.221
VOTE TO SWITCH SPACE -- WE'VE

02:29:57.288 --> 02:29:58.689
ELIMINATED.

02:29:58.756 --> 02:30:00.291
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OUT OF CDC

02:30:00.358 --> 02:30:01.792
ARE.

02:30:01.859 --> 02:30:04.261
AND WE'RE BEING TOLD.

02:30:04.328 --> 02:30:07.698
WE STILL NEED ALL THIS SPACE --

02:30:07.765 --> 02:30:09.200
IN MY MIND WHEN I USED TO DO

02:30:09.266 --> 02:30:12.103
REAL STATED -- BUT THE MISSED

02:30:12.169 --> 02:30:13.237
MORE LIKE AND I'VE HAD SOME

02:30:13.304 --> 02:30:16.307
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THAT -- YOU

02:30:16.374 --> 02:30:18.175
WOULD CONSOLIDATE RIGHT AND IF

02:30:18.242 --> 02:30:19.143
YOU DIDN'T NEED A BUILDING YOU

02:30:19.210 --> 02:30:20.911
COULD ACCESS ALL OUR OPERATIONS

02:30:20.978 --> 02:30:22.813
YOU WOULD DO THAT -- AND THAT

02:30:22.880 --> 02:30:24.882
THAT'S SCARY BECAUSE THEN YOU

02:30:24.949 --> 02:30:25.783
LOSE A BUILDING IN.

02:30:25.850 --> 02:30:28.452
AND YOU LOSE EVEN MORE PEOPLE

02:30:28.519 --> 02:30:29.286
AND SO.

02:30:29.353 --> 02:30:30.721
THERE I BELIEVE THERE'S ENOUGH

02:30:30.788 --> 02:30:32.156
SPACE.

02:30:32.223 --> 02:30:34.191
THERE WE JUST HAVE.

02:30:34.258 --> 02:30:36.394
TO HAVE PEOPLE THAT KNOW HOW. TO

02:30:36.460 --> 02:30:38.429
RECONFIGURE.

02:30:38.496 --> 02:30:40.498
SPACE ALLOCATIONS AND YOU HIGHER

02:30:40.564 --> 02:30:42.166
IS GIVE GROUPS THAT DO THAT ALL

02:30:42.233 --> 02:30:43.434
THE TIME.

02:30:43.501 --> 02:30:44.068
THEY DID IT WHEN I WAS THE CITY

02:30:44.135 --> 02:30:46.470
OF LA HE PROBABLY DID IT WHEN

02:30:46.537 --> 02:30:47.104
MISTER MOORE LOCK WHICH AT THE

02:30:47.171 --> 02:30:48.406
COUNTY SO YOU CAN LOOK AT YOUR

02:30:48.472 --> 02:30:50.741
SPACE ALLOCATION AND MAKE.

02:30:50.808 --> 02:30:53.544
SOME -- TO ME DECISIONS ARE

02:30:53.611 --> 02:30:54.712
SMART DECISIONS SO YOU CAN DO

02:30:54.779 --> 02:30:57.214
THAT SO THAT'S MY SECOND.

02:30:57.281 --> 02:30:58.983
FRUSTRATION OF HOW CAN WE WOULD

02:30:59.049 --> 02:31:00.651
GET YOU SIGNATURE CLASSROOM

02:31:00.718 --> 02:31:01.485
SEEING.

02:31:01.552 --> 02:31:04.221
ULTIMATELY GET PEOPLE DOING THAT

02:31:04.288 --> 02:31:05.723
I KNOW THE PROJECT WAS CHOMPING

02:31:05.790 --> 02:31:06.557
TO SAY SOMETHING YEAH I WANT TO

02:31:06.624 --> 02:31:08.292
SAY THAT I COMPLETELY CONCUR

02:31:08.359 --> 02:31:09.960
WITH YOU UNDERSTAND -- NOW

02:31:10.027 --> 02:31:11.929
ESPECIALLY WHAT YOU'RE TALKING

02:31:11.996 --> 02:31:13.697
ABOUT IN TERMS OF THAT YOU KNOW

02:31:13.764 --> 02:31:14.598
WE ARE WHAT WE PUT THESE MINUTE

02:31:14.665 --> 02:31:15.699
ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS IN

02:31:15.766 --> 02:31:16.967
BECAUSE WE WANTED TO KNOW AT THE

02:31:17.034 --> 02:31:18.235
END OF THE DAY WE ARE STILL.

02:31:18.302 --> 02:31:19.503
IMPLEMENTING THE BEST PROGRAMS

02:31:19.570 --> 02:31:20.704
WE COULD BUT I ABSOLUTELY

02:31:20.771 --> 02:31:21.772
UNDERSTAND -- SAYING THE ONE

02:31:21.839 --> 02:31:23.174
FEAR THAT WE'VE HAD INTERNALLY

02:31:23.240 --> 02:31:24.575
IS WHEN YOU DO A RESEARCH

02:31:24.642 --> 02:31:25.910
ANALYSIS ON SOMEBODY THAT HAD

02:31:25.976 --> 02:31:27.545
SAY TWENTY YEARS INCARCERATED

02:31:27.611 --> 02:31:30.781
AND THEY'VE TAKEN THIRTY

02:31:30.848 --> 02:31:32.016
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS.

02:31:32.082 --> 02:31:33.284
THAT THAT RECIDIVISM ANALYSIS

02:31:33.350 --> 02:31:34.452
ARE WE GOING TO PINPOINT THAT

02:31:34.518 --> 02:31:35.386
ONE PROGRAM IS A THAT WAS IT OR

02:31:35.453 --> 02:31:36.887
PINPOINT ACADEMIC AND SAY THAT

02:31:36.954 --> 02:31:38.255
WAS IT THAT'S WHY WE WANTED TO

02:31:38.322 --> 02:31:39.490
CALL IN A RESEARCHER TO SAY.

02:31:39.557 --> 02:31:41.192
A REAL REGRESSION ANALYSIS HAS

02:31:41.258 --> 02:31:43.027
TO BE DONE HERE TO PICK OUT THE

02:31:43.093 --> 02:31:44.295
RIGHT PIECES SO THAT WE'RE NOT

02:31:44.361 --> 02:31:46.263
GIVING YOUR RECIDIVISM FACT

02:31:46.330 --> 02:31:47.164
ABOUT SOMEBODY.

02:31:47.231 --> 02:31:48.566
THAT WAS ACTUALLY TIED TO

02:31:48.632 --> 02:31:49.700
SOMETHING ELSE THAT DONE SO

02:31:49.767 --> 02:31:50.935
THAT'S PART OF THE RESEARCH

02:31:51.001 --> 02:31:52.770
PROJECTS THAT WE WANT.

02:31:52.837 --> 02:31:54.038
TO BE CONTRACTED IN AND HAVE

02:31:54.104 --> 02:31:56.407
THEM LOOK AT IS JUST OUR FEAR IN

02:31:56.474 --> 02:31:57.775
MAKING THE WRONG IS --

02:31:57.842 --> 02:31:59.376
ASSESSMENT BY LOOKING AT

02:31:59.443 --> 02:32:01.078
RECIDIVISM TIED TO MAYBE ONE

02:32:01.145 --> 02:32:02.446
THING WHEN THEY'VE DONE TWENTY

02:32:02.513 --> 02:32:03.514
TWO DIFFERENT THINGS OVER THE

02:32:03.581 --> 02:32:04.482
COURSE OF DECADES WHETHER

02:32:04.548 --> 02:32:06.517
INCARCERATED SO I THINK THAT'S

02:32:06.584 --> 02:32:07.184
WHERE WE'RE COMING FROM A LITTLE

02:32:07.251 --> 02:32:08.586
BIT IN TERMS OF HESITANCY.

02:32:08.652 --> 02:32:09.386
BUT WE ARE ABSOLUTELY

02:32:09.453 --> 02:32:10.821
BRAINSTORMING EVERY DAY BECAUSE

02:32:10.888 --> 02:32:12.356
I RECOGNIZE WHAT YOU WANT I

02:32:12.423 --> 02:32:14.358
THINK THERE'S A WAY TO GET THERE --

02:32:14.425 --> 02:32:16.093
WE HAVE THE RECIDIVISM DATA WE

02:32:16.160 --> 02:32:18.295
HAVE THE DOJ DATA IT'S JUST

02:32:18.362 --> 02:32:19.029
ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE

02:32:19.096 --> 02:32:19.630
NOT.

02:32:19.697 --> 02:32:21.098
RESPONSIBLE ONE TAGGING IT TO

02:32:21.165 --> 02:32:22.399
ONE CERTAIN FACTOR CORRECTION I

02:32:22.466 --> 02:32:23.968
THINK WE WOULD BE COGNIZANT OF

02:32:24.034 --> 02:32:25.269
THAT AND ACTUALLY LOOK FOR THE

02:32:25.336 --> 02:32:26.303
TRENDS.

02:32:26.370 --> 02:32:28.072
RIGHT BECAUSE USUALLY MOST

02:32:28.138 --> 02:32:29.507
INMATES ARE INVOLVED IN SEVERAL

02:32:29.573 --> 02:32:31.141
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND NOT JUST

02:32:31.208 --> 02:32:31.809
ONE BUT I THINK FROM MY

02:32:31.876 --> 02:32:32.977
PERSPECTIVE WE'RE JUST TRYING TO

02:32:33.043 --> 02:32:34.512
FIGURE OUT WHICH ONES ARE TRULY

02:32:34.578 --> 02:32:35.513
ARE WORKING I HAVE THE BETTER

02:32:35.579 --> 02:32:37.948
TRENDS BECAUSE YOU'LL BE ABLE.

02:32:38.015 --> 02:32:41.619
TO TO TEASE THAT DATE.

02:32:41.685 --> 02:32:44.555
THAT DATA OUT.

02:32:44.622 --> 02:32:46.423
SO THE MIST MORE OR MISTER MOORE

02:32:46.490 --> 02:32:47.324

02:37:53.297 --> 02:37:54.798
SOMETHING IN TERMS OF

02:37:54.865 --> 02:37:55.499

THIS YEAR.

02:40:44.601 --> 02:40:50.340
IN TERMS OF ACADEMIC EDUCATION I

02:40:50.407 --> 02:40:51.742
MENTIONED IN ONE HEARING WE SEE

02:40:51.808 --> 02:40:53.076

LONGITUDINALLY WE DON'T HAVE A

02:40:54.811 --> 02:40:54.945
LOT.

02:40:55.012 --> 02:40:55.879

02:40:57.514 --> 02:41:00.150

IT.

02:41:13.096 --> 02:41:14.798
WE SEE RECIDIVISM IMPACTS

02:41:14.865 --> 02:41:16.400
SOMETIMES OFFER PEOPLE STAYING

02:41:16.466 --> 02:41:17.734
LONGER THAN SIX MONTHS OUT THOSE

02:41:17.801 --> 02:41:21.004

BE BROUGH.

02:41:44.995 --> 02:41:46.797
I THINK THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO

DOWN TO THE PERSON TAKING A

02:43:21.158 --> 02:43:22.592
CERTAIN ASPECT OF A CURRICULUM

02:43:22.659 --> 02:43:24.094

02:43:24.161 --> 02:43:25.762
THAT'S RELATED TO HIM SO VERY

02:43:25.829 --> 02:43:26.997
DETAILED INFORMATION BECAUSE WE

02:43:27.063 --> 02:43:27.631
KNOW IT'S GONNA BE USEFUL FOR

02:43:27.697 --> 02:43:28.331
RESEARCH.

02:43:28.398 --> 02:43:29.533
AND SO THERE'S BEEN THIS

02:43:29.599 --> 02:43:31.801
CATEGORIZATION OF EVERYTHING HAS

02:43:31.868 --> 02:43:34.070
TO BE IN THE RESULTS FIRST

02:43:34.137 --> 02:43:35.405
CLEARING HOUSE.

OUR CONTRACTS TO SAY THAT IT

02:43:39.676 --> 02:43:41.878
MUST BE EVIDENCE BASED WHEN WE

02:43:41.945 --> 02:43:43.079
DID A REVIEW OF SANSA.

02:43:43.146 --> 02:43:44.481
THEY SAID JUST BECAUSE IT'S NOT

02:43:44.548 --> 02:43:45.715
IN THIS CLEARING HOUSE DOES NOT

02:43:45.782 --> 02:43:46.950
MEAN IT'S EVIDENCE BASE JUST

02:43:47.017 --> 02:43:48.084
MEANS NOT RESEARCHED AND PUT IN

02:43:48.151 --> 02:43:49.252
THIS CLEARING HOUSE.

02:43:49.319 --> 02:43:50.987
SO WE WERE TRYING TO BE --

02:43:51.054 --> 02:43:52.889
COGNIZANT OF NOT APPROACHING

02:43:52.956 --> 02:43:55.392
THAT TOO AGGRESSIVELY TO SAY

02:43:55.458 --> 02:43:56.560
BECAUSE NOT EVERYTHING'S IN THE

02:43:56.626 --> 02:43:57.794
CLEARING HOUSE OUR PROVIDERS

02:43:57.861 --> 02:43:59.162
SOME OF THE 20% THAT'S

02:43:59.229 --> 02:44:00.197
REFERENCED IN HERE.

02:44:00.263 --> 02:44:02.465

THAT HAS HAD RESEARCH STUDIES

02:44:05.335 --> 02:44:07.804
BEHIND IT THAT SHOW THAT IT --

02:44:07.871 --> 02:44:09.873
RESULTS AND EFFECTIVE RECIDIVISM

02:44:09.940 --> 02:44:11.575
SO WE TRIED NOT TO BE SOMEWHAT

02:44:11.641 --> 02:44:12.809
BY THE DISCONNECT IN THE

02:44:12.876 --> 02:44:14.511
AUDITOR'S ACTUALLY SAYING IT'S

REFORM ACT WHICH MEANT THAT AT A

02:47:07.083 --> 02:47:08.451
CERTAIN POINT IN TIME.

02:47:08.518 --> 02:47:10.086
BETWEEN THREE AND FOUR THOUSAND

02:47:10.153 --> 02:47:10.987
LIFE INMATES WERE RETURNING TO

02:47:11.054 --> 02:47:12.856
THEIR COMMUNITIES AFTER HAVING

02:47:12.922 --> 02:47:14.391
BEEN FACING A LIFE SENTENCE.

02:47:14.457 --> 02:47:17.193
MANY OF THEM HAD BEEN IN PRISON

02:47:17.260 --> 02:47:17.761
FOR TEN TO SEVENTEEN TWENTY

02:47:17.827 --> 02:47:21.064
YEARS AT THIS POINT -- AND WE

02:47:21.131 --> 02:47:22.866
KNEW THAT THE SUCCESS OF THIS

02:47:22.932 --> 02:47:24.868
REFORM THE SUCCESS OF SENTENCING

02:47:24.934 --> 02:47:25.535
REFORM.

02:47:25.602 --> 02:47:27.170
CHANGED IN LARGE PART ON THE

02:47:27.237 --> 02:47:29.806
SUCCESS OF THE INDIVIDUALS OR

02:47:29.873 --> 02:47:30.140
GETTING OUT.

02:47:30.206 --> 02:47:33.009
AND BECAUSE WE ARE BECAUSE WE

02:47:33.076 --> 02:47:36.479
WORK WITH MULTIPLE COUNTIES --

02:47:36.546 --> 02:47:38.748
WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF DIFFERENT

02:47:38.815 --> 02:47:40.183
THINGS A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS

02:47:40.250 --> 02:47:43.353
A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH

02:47:43.420 --> 02:47:44.687
RE ENTRY HAS BEEN DONE -- OUR

02:47:44.754 --> 02:47:47.490
BIGGEST CONCERN FOR OUR CLIENT'S

02:47:47.557 --> 02:47:49.192
WAS THAT THEY HAVE A BAD

02:47:49.259 --> 02:47:49.492
[inaudible]

02:47:49.559 --> 02:47:50.960
AND FOOD.

02:47:51.027 --> 02:47:54.397
AND BASIC NECESSITIES IN A SAFE

02:47:54.464 --> 02:47:56.065
AND SOBRE ENVIRONMENT.

02:47:56.132 --> 02:47:58.001
THAT WAS WHAT WE THAT WAS WHAT

02:47:58.067 --> 02:47:59.803
WE FELT WAS AT THE BARE MINIMUM

02:47:59.869 --> 02:48:00.203
WHAT THEY NEEDED.

02:48:00.270 --> 02:48:03.006
AND IN MOST CASES THAT WAS A

02:48:03.072 --> 02:48:05.942
VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND WE

02:48:06.009 --> 02:48:07.977
SCOURED THE STATE GOING FROM

02:48:08.044 --> 02:48:09.145
COUNTY TO COUNTY TRYING TO FIND

02:48:09.212 --> 02:48:10.647
PROGRAMS WE HAD STANFORD LAW

02:48:10.713 --> 02:48:12.081
SCHOOL INTERNS.

02:48:12.148 --> 02:48:13.283
GOING THROUGH BOOKS TRYING TO

02:48:13.349 --> 02:48:15.485
FIND PLACES WHERE WE CAN SAFELY

02:48:15.552 --> 02:48:17.554
HOUSE OUR CLIENTS IT WAS VERY

02:48:17.620 --> 02:48:18.922
VERY DIFFICULT.

02:48:18.988 --> 02:48:20.557
WE EVENTUALLY FOUND A COUPLE OF

02:48:20.623 --> 02:48:21.591
PROGRAMS THAT WE REALLY BELIEVED

02:48:21.658 --> 02:48:23.493
IN THAT WE KNEW WERE GOING TO BE

02:48:23.560 --> 02:48:24.727
HELPFUL.

02:48:24.794 --> 02:48:25.895
EVEN THEN THERE WERE HUGE

02:48:25.962 --> 02:48:27.964
BARRIERS TO GETTING OUR CLIENTS

02:48:28.031 --> 02:48:29.466
IN THERE IF THEY WERE COMING

02:48:29.532 --> 02:48:30.967
FROM THE COUNTY IN WHICH A

02:48:31.034 --> 02:48:32.235
PROGRAM DIDN'T.

02:48:32.302 --> 02:48:34.070
THE PROGRAM DIDN'T EXIST WE

02:48:34.137 --> 02:48:34.604
WOULD HAVE TROUBLE EITHER

02:48:34.671 --> 02:48:36.206
GETTING THEIR PROBATION

02:48:36.272 --> 02:48:37.540
TRANSFERRED TO THE WE WOULD SAY

02:48:37.607 --> 02:48:38.942
LOOK WE HAVE A BED FOR THIS

02:48:39.008 --> 02:48:40.243
PERSON IN A PROGRAM THEY'RE

02:48:40.310 --> 02:48:41.244
GONNA FEED THIS PERSON THEY'RE

02:48:41.311 --> 02:48:42.612
GONNA HELP THIS PERSON GET THE

02:48:42.679 --> 02:48:43.813
SERVICES THEY NEED.

02:48:43.880 --> 02:48:45.114
AND GIVE THIS PERSON CBT

02:48:45.181 --> 02:48:46.983
PROGRAMMING AND HELP THEM RETURN

02:48:47.050 --> 02:48:48.284

TRANSFERRED OR WE'RE NOT GOING

02:48:53.723 --> 02:48:54.824
TO ALLOW THIS PERSON'S PAROLE TO

02:48:54.891 --> 02:48:56.860
BE TRANSFERRED BECAUSE THAT'S

02:48:56.926 --> 02:48:58.461
JUST NOT THE WAY WE DO THINGS.

02:48:58.528 --> 02:49:00.296
THIS MEANS THAT A CLIENT COMES

02:49:00.363 --> 02:49:03.266
OUT OF PRISON WITH TWO HUNDRED

02:49:03.333 --> 02:49:04.334
DOLLARS.

02:49:04.400 --> 02:49:05.568
GOES TO A BUS STOP.

02:49:05.635 --> 02:49:06.803
AND TAKES THAT BUS WHEREVER

02:49:06.870 --> 02:49:07.737
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO GO AND

02:49:07.804 --> 02:49:09.339
INSTRUCTIONS TO REPORT TO A

02:49:09.405 --> 02:49:11.774
PAROLE OFFICE -- INDIVIDUALS WHO

02:49:11.841 --> 02:49:13.510
ARE COMING OUT OF PRISON HAVE A

02:49:13.576 --> 02:49:16.079
THIRD THIRTEEN X. GREATER CHANCE

02:49:16.145 --> 02:49:18.381
OF DYING WITHIN THE FIRST TWO

02:49:18.448 --> 02:49:19.782
WEEKS OF RELEASE.

02:49:19.849 --> 02:49:21.518
THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF DEATH IS

02:49:21.584 --> 02:49:23.086
OVERDOSE THE SECOND LEADING

02:49:23.152 --> 02:49:24.888
CAUSE OF DEATH IS A HEART ATTACK

02:49:24.954 --> 02:49:26.322
WHICH IS GENERALLY RELATED TO

02:49:26.389 --> 02:49:27.423
OVERDOSE.

02:49:27.490 --> 02:49:29.392
IT IS INCREDIBLY STRESSFUL AND

02:49:29.459 --> 02:49:30.927
INCREDIBLY UNSTABLE TIME AND I

02:49:30.994 --> 02:49:32.795
WOULD ARGUE THAT WE SEND PEOPLE

02:49:32.862 --> 02:49:33.830
TO PRISON.

02:49:33.897 --> 02:49:35.665
FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME TEN

02:49:35.732 --> 02:49:38.401
YEARS AND MORE.

02:49:38.468 --> 02:49:39.669
WHEN THEY COME BACK AND?

02:49:39.736 --> 02:49:40.803
THEY'RE NOT THE SAME PERSON THEY

02:49:40.870 --> 02:49:41.404
WORE AND SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE

02:49:41.471 --> 02:49:43.506
MENTIONED THAT AND THEY NEED A

02:49:43.573 --> 02:49:46.276
SAFE PLACE AND WHICH TO READJUST.

02:49:46.342 --> 02:49:48.411
IN ORDER TO BE GOOD MEMBERS OF

02:49:48.478 --> 02:49:49.812
THEIR COMMUNITY -- IT'S AN

02:49:49.879 --> 02:49:51.114
INCREDIBLE BURDEN ON FAMILY

02:49:51.180 --> 02:49:53.116
MEMBERS TO SUDDENLY HAVE SOMEONE

02:49:53.182 --> 02:49:54.951
I KNOW I PERSONALLY FEEL

02:49:55.018 --> 02:49:56.619
BURDENED WHEN MY PARENTS STAY

02:49:56.686 --> 02:49:58.454
WITH ME FOR A WEEK EVEN IF

02:49:58.521 --> 02:49:59.088
THEY'RE LIVING IN A DIFFERENT.

02:49:59.155 --> 02:50:01.257
PLACE -- THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT

02:50:01.324 --> 02:50:03.293
ARE COMING TO FREQUENTLY -- THE

02:50:03.359 --> 02:50:05.395
SAME HOME IN WHICH THEY HAD

02:50:05.461 --> 02:50:06.362
COMMITTED THEIR CRIMES OF THEIR

02:50:06.429 --> 02:50:07.430
RETURN TO THEIR FAMILIES THEY

02:50:07.497 --> 02:50:08.531
MAY BE GOING TO THE SAME PLACE

02:50:08.598 --> 02:50:09.899
THEY WERE BEFORE.

02:50:09.966 --> 02:50:12.669
THEY WERE COMMITTED TO PRESENT --

02:50:12.735 --> 02:50:13.803
THEIR FOOT ON THE COMING TO

02:50:13.870 --> 02:50:15.772
PLACES IN WHICH THERE ARE FEW

02:50:15.838 --> 02:50:17.707
FINANCIAL RESOURCES.

02:50:17.774 --> 02:50:19.776
AND THEY'RE SUDDENLY PUT IN A

02:50:19.842 --> 02:50:21.044
POSITION WHERE THEY'RE RELYING

02:50:21.110 --> 02:50:23.346
ON FAMILY MEMBERS TO FEED THEM

02:50:23.413 --> 02:50:25.248
TO HOUSE THEM TO CLOSE THEM --

02:50:25.315 --> 02:50:25.949
TO TAKE THEM TO THEIR

02:50:26.015 --> 02:50:28.151
APPOINTMENTS THEIR HUGE HUGE

02:50:28.217 --> 02:50:30.086
NEEDS SOME PEOPLE NEED REGULAR

DIALYSIS APPOINTMENTS SOME

02:50:31.721 --> 02:50:32.622
PEOPLE NEED MENTAL HEALTH

02:50:32.689 --> 02:50:34.357
MEDICATIONS SOME PEOPLE NEED. TO

02:50:34.424 --> 02:50:35.558
BE CONNECTED WITH SERVICES

02:50:35.625 --> 02:50:37.293
WITHIN THE COMMUNITY AND WITHOUT

02:50:37.360 --> 02:50:40.296
THE SUPPORT REENTRY SUPPORT.

02:50:40.363 --> 02:50:41.631
THEY'RE REALLY NOT EQUIPPED TO

02:50:41.698 --> 02:50:42.765
DO THAT AND IT'S INCREDIBLE

02:50:42.832 --> 02:50:44.100
BURDEN ON THEIR FAMILIES WHO

02:50:44.167 --> 02:50:45.802
FREQUENTLY ARE ALSO NOT EQUIPPED

02:50:45.868 --> 02:50:47.637
TO DO THAT -- MY EXPERIENCE

02:50:47.704 --> 02:50:48.938
WORKING WITH THIS POPULATION

02:50:49.005 --> 02:50:50.273
OVER THE PAST SEVEN YEARS HAS

02:50:50.340 --> 02:50:53.042
CONVINCED ME THAT HAVING HAD AN

02:50:53.109 --> 02:50:54.877
INDIVIDUAL HAS BEEN INCARCERATED

02:50:54.944 --> 02:50:56.312
RETURN TO THEIR COMMUNITIES TO

02:50:56.379 --> 02:50:57.480
PROFESSIONAL.

02:50:57.547 --> 02:50:59.549
WRAPAROUND REENTRY PROGRAMS IS

02:50:59.616 --> 02:51:02.852
KEY. TO REDUCING RECIDIVISM AND

02:51:02.919 --> 02:51:03.820
TO PRODUCING THE KIND OF

02:51:03.886 --> 02:51:05.388
OUTCOMES THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR

02:51:05.455 --> 02:51:07.190
IN TERMS OF KEEPING OUR

02:51:07.256 --> 02:51:08.524
COMMUNITY SAFE.

02:51:08.591 --> 02:51:09.559
AND REALLY.

02:51:09.626 --> 02:51:10.393
I FEEL WE HAVE A BIT OF A MORAL

02:51:10.460 --> 02:51:12.028
OBLIGATION EVER GOING TO SEND

02:51:12.095 --> 02:51:13.196
PEOPLE TO PRISON FOR SUCH LONG

02:51:13.262 --> 02:51:14.564
PERIODS OF TIME.

02:51:14.631 --> 02:51:15.698
WE CAN'T JUST PUT THEM OUT ON

02:51:15.765 --> 02:51:17.133
THE STREET AND EXPECT THEM TO

02:51:17.200 --> 02:51:19.102
SUCCEED I THINK THERE ARE A LOT

02:51:19.168 --> 02:51:20.703
OF BARRIERS.

02:51:20.770 --> 02:51:21.471
RIGHT NOW THAT EXIST

02:51:21.537 --> 02:51:22.705
BUREAUCRATIC BARRIERS THAT

02:51:22.772 --> 02:51:24.173
PREVENT PEOPLE ACCESS TO THE

02:51:24.240 --> 02:51:26.209
ACTUAL PROGRAMMING THAT IS THERE

02:51:26.275 --> 02:51:26.843
FOR THEM BUT MAYBE IT'S IN THE

02:51:26.909 --> 02:51:27.677
WRONG COUNTY.

02:51:27.744 --> 02:51:29.712
AND THERE'S ALSO I THINK A REAL

DEARTH.

02:51:30.847 --> 02:51:33.216

02:51:39.689 --> 02:51:40.256
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT

02:51:40.323 --> 02:51:41.057
ARE INCARCERATED TODAY THE VAST

02:51:41.124 --> 02:51:42.892
MAJORITY OF THEM.

02:51:43.860 --> 02:51:45.895
COMMUNITIES AND IF WE WANT TO

02:51:45.962 --> 02:51:48.064
COMMUTERS TO BE SAFE WE NEED TO

02:58:59.295 --> 02:59:01.063
BUT I WANT TO SHARE ONE MORE

02:59:01.130 --> 02:59:02.798
STORY -- THERE'S A SEVEN YEAR

02:59:02.865 --> 02:59:05.301
OLD GIRL WHO LOST HER MOTHER AND

02:59:05.367 --> 02:59:06.402
GRANDMOTHER LAST YEAR TO A

02:59:06.469 --> 02:59:07.970
HEROIN OVERDOSE IN A FATHER

02:59:08.037 --> 02:59:09.772
WHOSE ONLY SEEN A FEW MONTHS IN

02:59:09.839 --> 02:59:10.339
OUR LIFE.

02:59:10.406 --> 02:59:12.374
HIGHS BEEN INCARCERATED FIVE

02:59:12.441 --> 02:59:14.009
TIMES NOW.

02:59:14.076 --> 02:59:15.377
SHE'S INTELLIGENT YOUNG LOVING

02:59:15.444 --> 02:59:18.013
BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL AND

02:59:18.080 --> 02:59:19.448
UNFORTUNATELY SHE LIVES IN A

02:59:19.515 --> 02:59:20.416
STATE WHERE THESE KIND OF

02:59:20.483 --> 02:59:21.984
SERVICES ARE SIMPLY JUST NOT

02:59:22.051 --> 02:59:23.719
AVAILABLE BOTH FOR HER MOTHER

02:59:23.786 --> 02:59:26.055
AND FOR HER FATHER -- THAT THE

02:59:26.122 --> 02:59:27.690
YOUNG LADY IS MY NIECE I'M IN

02:59:27.756 --> 02:59:28.891
THE PROCESS OF WORKING ON THE

02:59:28.958 --> 02:59:30.559
ADOPTION RIGHT NOW WITH MY WIFE

02:59:30.626 --> 02:59:31.794
AND DAUGHTER BRINGING HER HERE

02:59:31.861 --> 02:59:32.795
TO CALIFORNIA.

02:59:32.862 --> 02:59:34.029
I WANT TO MENTION THAT BECAUSE

02:59:34.096 --> 02:59:36.499
EVERYTHING WE DISCUSS HERE HAS A

02:59:36.565 --> 02:59:38.901
VERY HUMAN AND HAPPEN TO IT -- I

02:59:38.968 --> 02:59:40.269
IN I DID SHARE THAT STORY NOT

02:59:40.336 --> 02:59:43.139
JUST TO SHOW -- THE HUMAN ASPECT

02:59:43.205 --> 02:59:44.240
OF IT BUT JUST TO REMIND THAT

02:59:44.306 --> 02:59:45.975
CALIFORNIA IS TAKING PROGRESSIVE

02:59:46.041 --> 02:59:47.276
STEPS WE LOOK AT SO MANY

02:59:47.343 --> 02:59:48.911
EVIDENCE BASED MODELS THAT ARE

02:59:48.978 --> 02:59:50.012
IN OTHER STATES.

02:59:50.079 --> 02:59:51.747
CALIFORNIA TRULY SHOULD BE AN

02:59:51.814 --> 02:59:53.516
EVIDENCE BASED MODEL WHAT WE'RE

02:59:53.582 --> 02:59:55.050
DOING HERE NEEDS TO BE EVALUATED

02:59:55.117 --> 02:59:56.118
AND IT DOES NEED TO BE THE

02:59:56.185 --> 02:59:57.520
EVIDENCE BASED MODEL MANY OF THE

02:59:57.586 --> 02:59:58.921
THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT AND I'VE

02:59:58.988 --> 02:59:59.922
HEARD TODAY.

02:59:59.989 --> 03:00:01.490
ARE MODELS THAT ARE REPLICATED

03:00:01.557 --> 03:00:03.392
FROM OTHER STATES AND I'D REALLY

03:00:03.459 --> 03:00:05.394
LIKE TO SEE CALIFORNIA BECOME

03:00:05.461 --> 03:00:06.629
THE LEADER IN TERMS OF

03:00:06.695 --> 03:00:08.631
RECIDIVISM REDUCTION.

03:00:08.697 --> 03:00:10.766
IN THE UNITED STATES.

03:00:10.833 --> 03:00:12.234
JUST A FEW PROGRAMS THAT I THINK

03:00:12.301 --> 03:00:13.502
WERE MENTIONED HERE EARLIER

03:00:13.569 --> 03:00:15.237
TODAY'S M. C. R. P. PROGRAMMER

03:00:15.304 --> 03:00:16.605
THE MEN'S COMMUNITY RANCHER

03:00:16.672 --> 03:00:18.274
PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO

03:00:18.340 --> 03:00:19.642
STAY THE LAST YEAR THERE SENS ON

03:00:19.708 --> 03:00:20.943
AN ANKLE MONITOR IN THE

03:00:21.010 --> 03:00:21.877
COMMUNITY.

03:00:21.944 --> 03:00:23.712
AND THOSE PROGRAMS ARE SEEN VERY

03:00:23.779 --> 03:00:25.781
SUCCESSFUL RESULTS WE COUPLED

03:00:25.848 --> 03:00:28.050
WITH -- THE LIFE FOR PROGRAMS

03:00:28.117 --> 03:00:29.318
WERE LIFERS ARE ACTUALLY SERVING

03:00:29.385 --> 03:00:30.920
AS MENTORS THEY'RE RECEIVING

03:00:30.986 --> 03:00:32.388
SOME OF THE SERVICES THEY NEED.

03:00:32.454 --> 03:00:34.089
AND WE'RE ACTUALLY ABLE TO HIRE

03:00:34.156 --> 03:00:35.658
A LARGE AMOUNT OF OUR WORK FORCE

03:00:35.724 --> 03:00:37.226
IT'S FORMALLY INCARCERATED I

03:00:37.293 --> 03:00:38.561
THINK THE STATE SHOULD ALSO LOOK

03:00:38.627 --> 03:00:40.763
AT PROVIDERS THAT EMPLOYEE MEN

03:00:40.829 --> 03:00:41.864

03:00:41.931 --> 03:00:42.965
INCARCERATED.

03:00:43.032 --> 03:00:44.967
AND SHOULD PROVIDE PATHWAYS OF

03:00:45.034 --> 03:00:46.835
EMPLOYMENT BECAUSE NONPROFITS A

03:00:46.902 --> 03:00:48.704
COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDERS ARE A

03:00:48.771 --> 03:00:51.540
LARGE EMPLOYER IN THE COMMUNITY

03:00:51.607 --> 03:00:52.374

JUST A LITTLE BIT OF A DATA

03:00:53.342 --> 03:00:54.443
POINT HERE AND ONE THING THAT

03:00:54.510 --> 03:00:56.145
OFTEN GETS LEFT OUT IS YOUR

03:00:56.212 --> 03:00:57.746
SEVEN TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE RE

03:00:57.813 --> 03:00:59.448
INCARCERATED A RETURN TO PRISON

03:00:59.515 --> 03:01:00.783
IF YOU'RE HOMELESS.

03:01:00.849 --> 03:01:02.284
THERE'S A HUGE DISCONNECT IN

03:01:02.351 --> 03:01:03.485
TERMS OF THE SERVICES THAT ARE

03:01:03.552 --> 03:01:05.487

DISCUSSION ON RETURN ON

03:01:13.495 --> 03:01:14.563

03:01:16.332 --> 03:01:17.900
SUCCESSFUL REENTRY SERVICES WE

ACCOUNTABLE TO THOSE STANDARDS.

03:01:22.004 --> 03:01:23.172
THEN THERE SHOULD BE A DIRECT

03:01:23.239 --> 03:01:25.674

03:05:15.604 --> 03:05:16.705
REINTEGRATION BACK INTO THE

03:05:16.772 --> 03:05:17.840
COMMUNITY OF THEY ALLOW THAT

03:05:17.906 --> 03:05:19.775
TIME AND I THINK THEY ARE

03:05:19.842 --> 03:05:22.110
SUCCESSFUL -- I DON'T HAVE ANY

03:05:22.177 --> 03:05:23.612
LONG TERM DATE ON IT BUT I CAN

03:05:23.679 --> 03:05:25.614
TELL YOU OUT OF THE TWO PROGRAMS

03:05:25.681 --> 03:05:27.850
THAT WE HAVE -- STARTING JUST

03:05:27.916 --> 03:05:30.652
FROM JULY TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN

03:05:30.719 --> 03:05:32.921
UP UNTIL MARCH OF THIS YEAR WE

03:05:32.988 --> 03:05:35.491
HAD -- FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY

03:05:35.557 --> 03:05:36.024
FIVE WOMEN DOES CHARGE THE

03:05:36.091 --> 03:05:36.792
PROGRAM.

03:05:36.859 --> 03:05:38.961
OF THAT FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY

03:05:39.027 --> 03:05:40.963
WERE SUCCESSFULLY DISCHARGED --

03:05:41.029 --> 03:05:42.631
ON A PAROLE AND SO THAT'S A

03:05:42.698 --> 03:05:44.166
SEVENTY NINE POINT 2% SUCCESS

03:05:44.233 --> 03:05:46.168
RATE AND THESE ARE ALL VOLUNTEER

03:05:46.235 --> 03:05:48.871
PROGRAMS SO -- THEIR WOMEN THE

03:05:48.937 --> 03:05:50.172
VOLUNTEER FOR THE PROGRAM COME

03:05:50.239 --> 03:05:51.607
THERE AND IF THEY DON'T WANT TO

03:05:51.673 --> 03:05:52.875
BE IN THE PROGRAM THEY CAN ASK

03:05:52.941 --> 03:05:54.243
TO BE.

03:05:54.309 --> 03:05:55.644
SENT BACK -- THE OTHER PROGRAM

03:05:55.711 --> 03:05:57.212
I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IS THE

03:05:57.279 --> 03:05:58.313
SPECIALIZED TREATMENT FOR

03:05:58.380 --> 03:06:03.585
OPTIMIZE PROGRAMMING THE STOP

03:06:03.652 --> 03:06:04.186
PROGRAM AND THAT'S THE AFTER

03:06:04.253 --> 03:06:04.386
CARE.

03:06:04.453 --> 03:06:06.522
NOW WORK FOR OUR IN PRISON

03:06:06.588 --> 03:06:08.023
TREATMENT PROGRAMS -- THIS

03:06:08.090 --> 03:06:09.057
RELIES ON COMMUNITY BASED

03:06:09.124 --> 03:06:11.226
PROGRAMS IN EACH COUNTY -- TO BE

03:06:11.293 --> 03:06:13.662
THE RE ENTRY -- LOCATION FOR

03:06:13.729 --> 03:06:14.930
PEOPLE COMING OUT IT'S

03:06:14.997 --> 03:06:16.632
PRIORITIZE FOR PEOPLE WITHIN THE

03:06:16.698 --> 03:06:18.200
FIRST YEAR OF RELEASE HE EITHER

03:06:18.267 --> 03:06:19.701
UPON RELEASE OF THE FIRST YEAR

03:06:19.768 --> 03:06:20.769
OF RELEASE.

03:06:20.836 --> 03:06:24.006
BUT ANYBODY ON PAROLES ELIGIBLE --

03:06:24.072 --> 03:06:26.441
THIS PROGRAM I THINK IS IS

03:06:26.508 --> 03:06:28.343
SUCCESSFUL IT RELIES ON GOOD

03:06:28.410 --> 03:06:29.945
COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS THAT

03:06:30.012 --> 03:06:31.713
ARE THAT ARE IN EACH COMMUNITY

03:06:31.780 --> 03:06:33.315
TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES THEY CAN

03:06:33.382 --> 03:06:34.750
PROVIDE RESIDENTIAL.

03:06:34.816 --> 03:06:36.518
OUTPATIENT AND SOBER LIVING IN

03:06:36.585 --> 03:06:39.354
TRANSITIONAL HOUSING SERVICES --

03:06:39.421 --> 03:06:40.989
I THINK THAT THE PROGRAM COULD

03:06:41.056 --> 03:06:42.457
USE SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING

03:06:42.524 --> 03:06:44.526
BECAUSE THERE IS NOT WALT WHILE

03:06:44.593 --> 03:06:46.528
THE R. P. I THINK ALLOCATES ALL

03:06:46.595 --> 03:06:47.462
FUNDING THAT THEY HAVE TOWARDS

03:06:47.529 --> 03:06:50.198
IT -- THERE IS A GREATER NEED OF

03:06:50.265 --> 03:06:52.534
PEOPLE COME IN -- PER ALL COMING

03:06:52.601 --> 03:06:54.336
TO US FOR PLACEMENTS THEN WE

03:06:54.403 --> 03:06:56.271
HAVE THE THE ABILITY TO PLAY

03:06:56.338 --> 03:06:58.373
SINCE AWAITING LESSER ARE --

03:06:58.440 --> 03:06:59.808
HAPPENING BECAUSE OF THAT WITHIN

03:06:59.875 --> 03:07:01.777
THE STOP NETWORK WE ARE WORKING

03:07:01.843 --> 03:07:03.745
WITH THE R. P. TO LEVERAGE MEDI

03:07:03.812 --> 03:07:05.080
CAL THROUGH THE ORGANIZED

03:07:05.147 --> 03:07:06.481
DELIVERY SYSTEM.

03:07:06.548 --> 03:07:08.250
AND I KNOW THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT

03:07:08.317 --> 03:07:10.052
HOW DO WE LEVERAGE OTHER FUNDING --

03:07:10.118 --> 03:07:12.487
BUT I THINK THE KEY THING IS TO

03:07:12.554 --> 03:07:17.960
REALIZE HAT NUMBER ONE IT.

03:07:18.026 --> 03:07:20.295
AND SOME COUNTIES DIDN'T OFTEN.

03:07:20.362 --> 03:07:22.264
PERIOD SO IT'S NOT AVAILABLE IN

03:07:22.331 --> 03:07:23.999
EVERY COUNTY SO WE ARE WORKING

03:07:24.066 --> 03:07:25.500
WITH THEM TO ROLL THIS OUT AND

03:07:25.567 --> 03:07:27.669
USE THAT TO TO LEVERAGE THE

03:07:27.736 --> 03:07:33.875
FUNDS -- I THINK THAT -- WHEN I

03:07:33.942 --> 03:07:36.645
WHEN I LOOK AT THIS I LOOK AT

03:07:36.712 --> 03:07:37.446
WE TALK ABOUT EVIDENCE BASED

03:07:37.512 --> 03:07:39.748
PROGRAMMING SOMETIMES EVIDENCE

03:07:39.815 --> 03:07:41.083
BASED PROGRAM IS A LITTLE TRICKY.

03:07:41.149 --> 03:07:42.985
BECAUSE YOU TALK ABOUT EVIDENCE

03:07:43.051 --> 03:07:44.386
BASED PROGRAMMING PRACTICES.

03:07:44.453 --> 03:07:45.554
WELL THESE PROGRAMS A LOT OF

03:07:45.621 --> 03:07:47.189
TIMES WHEN THEY GET ON THESE ON

03:07:47.255 --> 03:07:49.157
THESE LISTS WERE DONE.

03:07:49.224 --> 03:07:50.626
IN A REALLY.

03:07:50.692 --> 03:07:52.327
HEIGHTENED CONTROLLED

03:07:52.394 --> 03:07:53.895
ENVIRONMENT WHETHER SPECIFIC

03:07:53.962 --> 03:07:56.298
POPULATION WITH SPECIFIC FUNDING

03:07:56.365 --> 03:07:59.334
LEVELS -- FOR A SPECIFIC PERSON

03:07:59.401 --> 03:08:01.403
AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS REP OF

03:08:01.470 --> 03:08:04.206
GLOBAL EXACTLY -- SO WE HAVE TO

03:08:04.272 --> 03:08:05.907
WATCH APPLES FOR APPLES IS THAT

03:08:05.974 --> 03:08:08.110
REALLY THE SAME POPULATION IS IT

03:08:08.176 --> 03:08:09.778
REALLY THE SAME CONDITIONS IS IT

03:08:09.845 --> 03:08:10.579
REALLY.

03:08:10.646 --> 03:08:12.481
IS EVERYTHING THE SAME SO IF YOU

03:08:12.547 --> 03:08:14.282
WANT TO DO THE STATS THEN YOU

03:08:14.349 --> 03:08:15.984
REALLY HAVE TO COMPARE APPLES TO

03:08:16.051 --> 03:08:17.786
APPLES -- YOU CAN'T SAY WELL

03:08:17.853 --> 03:08:19.354
THIS POPULATION GOT TO GO

03:08:19.421 --> 03:08:23.692
THROUGH THIS PROGRAM --

03:08:23.759 --> 03:08:24.359
SPECIFICALLY WITH NO

03:08:24.426 --> 03:08:25.827
INTERRUPTIONS IN THIS POPULATION

03:08:25.894 --> 03:08:26.294
WELL YEAH THEY HAD.

03:08:26.361 --> 03:08:27.529
HALF THE TIME THEY WERE IN THERE

03:08:27.596 --> 03:08:29.598
THEY GOT LOCKED DOWN AND BECAUSE

03:08:29.665 --> 03:08:30.899
OF OTHER THINGS THAT HAPPENED.

03:08:30.966 --> 03:08:33.702
AND SO HOW DO YOU COMPARE THE

03:08:33.769 --> 03:08:34.302
TWO JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE

03:08:34.369 --> 03:08:36.238
SAME CURRICULUM DOESN'T MAKE A

03:08:36.304 --> 03:08:38.740
COMPARISON OF THE TWO I THINK

03:08:38.807 --> 03:08:40.042
CDC ARE WORKS.

03:08:40.108 --> 03:08:41.109
OUT REALLY GOOD AND WE'VE HAD

03:08:41.176 --> 03:08:42.944
GOOD CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM

03:08:43.011 --> 03:08:44.613
ABOUT THE RIGHT PERSON.

03:08:44.680 --> 03:08:47.315
IN THE RIGHT PROGRAM AT THE

03:08:47.382 --> 03:08:48.684
RIGHT TIME.

03:08:48.750 --> 03:08:51.420
SO I THINK THAT IF YOU DO THAT

03:08:51.486 --> 03:08:52.387
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE THE BEST

03:08:52.454 --> 03:08:55.824
OUTCOMES -- I THINK THAT WE NEED

03:08:55.891 --> 03:08:57.626
TO LOOK AT UGH.

03:08:57.693 --> 03:08:59.961
I WOULD SUGGEST THAT -- CDC ARE

03:09:00.028 --> 03:09:02.264
NEED SOME FLEXIBILITY IN THERE

03:09:02.330 --> 03:09:03.498
AND SOME OF THEIR CONTRACTING TO

03:09:03.565 --> 03:09:05.033
ADAPT TO CHANGES THAT HAPPEN.

03:09:05.100 --> 03:09:06.401
CHANGES IN THE ENVIRONMENT

03:09:06.468 --> 03:09:08.036
CHANGES AND SO WE HAVE A

03:09:08.103 --> 03:09:09.604
CONTRACT THAT COMES ALONG AND

03:09:09.671 --> 03:09:11.273
NOW ALL THE SUDDEN YOU HAVE WILL

03:09:11.339 --> 03:09:12.774
JUST GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE THE

03:09:12.841 --> 03:09:14.009
ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM AND

03:09:14.076 --> 03:09:16.578
NOW -- MEDICAID MEDICARE WAS

03:09:16.645 --> 03:09:18.580
PAYING FOR RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT

03:09:18.647 --> 03:09:21.783
WILL WHAT USED TO BE A LEVEL OF

03:09:21.850 --> 03:09:24.119
REIMBURSEMENT WILL SAY IS EIGHTY

03:09:24.186 --> 03:09:27.422
ONE DOLLARS A DAY IS NOW GONE UP

03:09:27.489 --> 03:09:28.056
TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE DOLLARS

03:09:28.123 --> 03:09:29.691
A DAY IN YOUR BE ABLE TO HIRE

03:09:29.758 --> 03:09:30.425
STAFF.

03:09:30.492 --> 03:09:32.027
AT HIGHER SALARIES AND THINGS

03:09:32.094 --> 03:09:33.862
LIKE THIS AND SO THE MARKET

03:09:33.929 --> 03:09:35.564
CHANGES AND IF YOU'RE STUCK IN

03:09:35.630 --> 03:09:37.365
CONTRACTS FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND

03:09:37.432 --> 03:09:39.234
YOU CAN'T ADAPT TO THOSE MARKET

03:09:39.301 --> 03:09:39.701
CHANGES.

03:09:39.768 --> 03:09:41.436
THAT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO

03:09:41.503 --> 03:09:44.106
HIRE STAFF RETAIN STAFF AND DO

03:09:44.172 --> 03:09:45.640
THOSE THINGS AND WHEN YOU TALK

03:09:45.707 --> 03:09:50.946
ABOUT -- ALSO -- WHAT THEY'RE

03:09:51.012 --> 03:09:55.217
WHAT THE STAFFING YOU KNOW

03:09:55.283 --> 03:09:55.517
[inaudible]

03:09:55.584 --> 03:09:57.552
VACANCIES ARE.

03:09:57.619 --> 03:09:58.553
UNLESS YOU KNOW STAFF MEMBERS

03:09:58.620 --> 03:10:00.822
GONNA DO SOME.

03:10:00.889 --> 03:10:02.224
STRANGE THAT'S GET OUT GET THEM

03:10:02.290 --> 03:10:03.992
FIRED ARE THERE GOING TO GO LOOK

03:10:04.059 --> 03:10:04.893
FOR A JOB AND THEY TELL USE

03:10:04.960 --> 03:10:06.995
SEVERAL TIMES MONTHS IN ADVANCE.

03:10:07.062 --> 03:10:08.697
IF SOMEBODY JUST LEAVES ARE AS

03:10:08.764 --> 03:10:09.531
REMOVED FROM A PROGRAM.

03:10:09.598 --> 03:10:13.201
IT'S TIME ONE TO ADVERTISE TO TO

03:10:13.268 --> 03:10:14.936
GET A BACKGROUND CLARENCE DONE.

03:10:15.003 --> 03:10:16.471
THREE TO DO YOU KNOW DO YOUR

03:10:16.538 --> 03:10:17.506
INTERVIEWING AND ALL THAT.

03:10:17.572 --> 03:10:18.840
YOUR YOUR PHYSICAL YOUR YOUR

03:10:18.907 --> 03:10:20.609
DRUG TEST BACKGROUND TO SO IT

03:10:20.675 --> 03:10:21.977
TAKES TIME SO IT'S VIRTUALLY

03:10:22.043 --> 03:10:23.645
IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP THESE

03:10:23.712 --> 03:10:26.081
PROGRAMS FAILED STAFFING WISE A

03:10:26.148 --> 03:10:29.251
100% OF THE TIME -- IT JUST IS --

03:10:29.317 --> 03:10:30.085
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE DON'T

03:10:30.152 --> 03:10:35.524
STRIVE FOR IT BUT IS IT IS TOUGH --

03:10:35.590 --> 03:10:37.159
I THIS REMINDS ME OF A OF A

03:10:37.225 --> 03:10:37.759
QUOTE THAT -- HARRY TRUMAN'S

03:10:37.826 --> 03:10:39.361
THAT IT SAYS IT'S AMAZING WHAT

03:10:39.427 --> 03:10:40.896
YOU CAN DO WHEN YOU ACCOMPLISH.

03:10:40.962 --> 03:10:41.930
IT'S AMAZING WHAT YOU CAN

03:10:41.997 --> 03:10:44.466
ACCOMPLISH IF YOU DON'T CARE WHO

03:10:44.533 --> 03:10:45.801
GETS THE CREDIT.

03:10:45.867 --> 03:10:46.802
I THINK THAT ALSO NEEDS TO LOOK

03:10:46.868 --> 03:10:49.638
AT WHO TAKES THE BLAME.

03:10:49.704 --> 03:10:51.006
AND I THINK WE HAVE A GREAT

03:10:51.072 --> 03:10:53.241
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE WITH CDC

03:10:53.308 --> 03:10:54.309
ARE IN THE RP I THINK WE ALL

03:10:54.376 --> 03:10:55.277
TAKE THE BLAME FOR SOME OF THE

03:10:55.343 --> 03:10:58.847
RESULTS -- SOME OTHER THINGS --

03:10:58.914 --> 03:11:00.916
THAT AND I APPLAUD THEIR

03:11:00.982 --> 03:11:04.186
OPENNESS TO LISTEN DASS

03:11:04.252 --> 03:11:06.154
PROVIDERS AS VENDORS IN TO SAY

03:11:06.221 --> 03:11:09.090
HEY THIS DOESNT WORK -- THIS

03:11:09.157 --> 03:11:10.826
DOESN'T WORK IF -- WE NEED TO

03:11:10.892 --> 03:11:11.793
MAKE A CHANGE HERE THIS ISN'T

03:11:11.860 --> 03:11:12.961
GONNA GIVE US A SUCCESSFUL

03:11:13.028 --> 03:11:14.029
OUTCOME AND I THINK THAT THEY

03:11:14.095 --> 03:11:15.263
ARE LISTENING.

03:11:15.330 --> 03:11:17.232
AND THEY ARE WILLING TO TO MAKE

03:11:17.299 --> 03:11:18.300
THE CHANGE AND MAYBE THE AUDIT

03:11:18.366 --> 03:11:19.601
DIDN'T SHOW THAT BUT I COULD

03:11:19.668 --> 03:11:20.969
TELL YOU OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH

03:11:21.036 --> 03:11:23.305
THEM SHOWS ADAPTABILITY AND AND

03:11:23.371 --> 03:11:25.841
BEING WILLING TO CHANGE -- BUT I

03:11:25.907 --> 03:11:26.908
THINK IT TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF

03:11:26.975 --> 03:11:28.310
TIME YEAH AND I THINK THAT'S

03:11:28.376 --> 03:11:29.945
WHERE EVERYONE'S EXPERIENCE OF

03:11:30.011 --> 03:11:31.479
PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN DOING THIS

03:11:31.546 --> 03:11:32.647
FOR A LONG TIME.

03:11:32.714 --> 03:11:34.216
CAN HELP INFORM THE DISCUSSION

03:11:34.282 --> 03:11:35.283
ARE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT THE

03:11:35.350 --> 03:11:36.785
OUTCOME SO IT'S NOT IT'S LOOKING

03:11:36.852 --> 03:11:38.153
AT THE DATA BUT LOOKING THROUGH

03:11:38.220 --> 03:11:39.688
IT WITH THE LANDS OF ONE

03:11:39.754 --> 03:11:41.089
COMPARING APPLES APPLES.

03:11:41.156 --> 03:11:43.024
MAYBE YOU'RE COMPARING YOU KNOW

03:11:43.091 --> 03:11:44.526
A LEVEL TWO IN MAY TO A LEVEL

03:11:44.593 --> 03:11:45.961
TWO IN MAY BUT WHAT FACILITY AND

03:11:46.027 --> 03:11:47.529
SEE WHAT THOSE TRENDS ARE.

03:11:47.596 --> 03:11:48.997
BECAUSE YOU CAN YOU KNOW LOOK AT

03:11:49.064 --> 03:11:50.599
ONE FACILITY AND MAYBE IT WAS A

03:11:50.665 --> 03:11:52.801
LOCK DOWN A LOT MORE OFTEN THAN

03:11:52.868 --> 03:11:55.570
ANOTHER FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS.

03:11:55.637 --> 03:11:56.204
BUT SEEING WHAT THOSE OUTCOMES

03:11:56.271 --> 03:11:56.671
ARE.

03:11:56.738 --> 03:11:57.672
AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE

03:11:57.739 --> 03:11:59.174
THINGS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

03:11:59.241 --> 03:12:01.142
FIGURE OUT IS -- WHAT ARE THOSE

03:12:01.209 --> 03:12:01.810
BEST OUTCOMES AND THAT'S WHY WE

03:12:01.877 --> 03:12:02.644
KEEP?

03:12:02.711 --> 03:12:04.446
ASKING FOR THE ANALYTICS I THINK

03:12:04.512 --> 03:12:06.314
THE AUDITOR'S REPORT IS ASKING

03:12:06.381 --> 03:12:07.249
FOR THOSE.

03:12:07.315 --> 03:12:11.720
NOT TO SAY SOMEONE'S DOING

03:12:11.786 --> 03:12:12.587
SOMETHING WRONG.

03:12:12.654 --> 03:12:13.355
BUT TO REALLY INFORM THE

03:12:13.421 --> 03:12:15.190
DISCUSSION ON HOW DO WE KEEP

03:12:15.257 --> 03:12:15.557
DOING IT RIGHT.

03:12:15.624 --> 03:12:16.691
HOW MUCH OF THOSE PROGRAMS ARE

03:12:16.758 --> 03:12:17.592
DOING IT RIGHT AND HOW DO WE

03:12:17.659 --> 03:12:18.393
MAXIMIZE ON THAT?

03:12:18.460 --> 03:12:21.796
I APPRECIATE YOUR GUISES

03:12:21.863 --> 03:12:22.931
TESTIMONY BECAUSE I DO THINK AND

03:12:22.998 --> 03:12:24.666
IT NEEDS TO BE A WRAPAROUND

03:12:24.733 --> 03:12:28.603
SERVICES THINK -- THAT'S WHAT --

03:12:28.670 --> 03:12:29.271
MISS CHAMPION WAS TALKING ABOUT.

03:12:29.337 --> 03:12:30.739
IT AND ALL OF YOU ARE TALKING

03:12:30.805 --> 03:12:32.274
ABOUT HOW DO WE DO IT DIGEST.

03:12:32.340 --> 03:12:33.608
NCDC ARW BUT WHEN THEY COME OUT

03:12:33.675 --> 03:12:35.543
AND I KNOW I'VE BEEN PRIVY TO

03:12:35.610 --> 03:12:37.846
SEE SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS -- IN

03:12:37.913 --> 03:12:42.284
MY OWN BACKYARD WHERE.

03:12:42.350 --> 03:12:43.318
IF NAY MAY TRULY WANTS TO NOT GO

03:12:43.385 --> 03:12:45.353
BACK IN THE SYSTEM IS HOW DO WE

03:12:45.420 --> 03:12:47.956
CONNECT THEM WITH THE SERVICES.

03:12:48.023 --> 03:12:50.992
TO GIVE THEM THE MAXIMUM.

03:12:51.059 --> 03:12:52.460
CHANCE AT AT SUCCESS.

03:12:52.527 --> 03:12:54.262
AT HOLDING DOWN A JOB AT

03:12:54.329 --> 03:12:55.030
CONNECTING WITH SERVICES IF THE

03:12:55.096 --> 03:12:56.498
NEED SERVICES SPECIALLY IF THEY

03:12:56.564 --> 03:12:57.999
HAVE CHILDREN AND LOVED ONES.

03:12:58.066 --> 03:12:59.935
RIGHT IN THAT AS A MOTIVATION TO

03:13:00.001 --> 03:13:00.769
CONTINUE TO MOVE THEM FORWARD

03:13:00.835 --> 03:13:02.604
SOME JUST ASK A GENERAL QUESTION

03:13:02.671 --> 03:13:04.239
OF ALL OF YOU AND THAT'S JUST --

03:13:04.306 --> 03:13:06.107
YOU KNOW WHAT MORE WOULD YOU

03:13:06.174 --> 03:13:07.676
GUYS NEED FROM SAY EITHER CDC

03:13:07.742 --> 03:13:09.444
ARE THE STATE TO ACTUALLY HELP

03:13:09.511 --> 03:13:10.045
WITH THESE OUTCOMES BECAUSE I

03:13:10.111 --> 03:13:11.646
THINK WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE

03:13:11.713 --> 03:13:14.015
IN TERMS OF WHAT WE WANT TO

03:13:14.082 --> 03:13:15.617
ACHIEVE.

03:13:15.684 --> 03:13:16.952
SO IS THERE SOMETHING THAT

03:13:17.018 --> 03:13:19.154
YOU'VE IDENTIFIED. TO HELP WITH

03:13:19.220 --> 03:13:23.558
THAT LOVE TO HEAR YOUR RESPONSES.

03:13:23.625 --> 03:13:24.926
THIS BIG GENERALLY ALLEYS OUR

03:13:24.993 --> 03:13:26.328
PROGRAM HAS A RE ENTRY PROGRAM

03:13:26.394 --> 03:13:28.129
THAT WE DESIGNED WITH FORMER

03:13:28.196 --> 03:13:29.397
INMATES.

03:13:29.464 --> 03:13:31.566
THROUGH THE ANTI RECIDIVISM

03:13:31.633 --> 03:13:35.170
COALITION WE HAVE FORMER FORMER

03:13:35.236 --> 03:13:36.571
INMATES PICK UP.

03:13:36.638 --> 03:13:37.672
FROM THE PRISON GATES THEY ARE

03:13:37.739 --> 03:13:38.173
IN A POSITION TO REALLY

03:13:38.239 --> 03:13:38.740
UNDERSTAND THEM.

03:13:38.807 --> 03:13:39.607
THAT PROGRAM WAS PICKED UP BY

03:13:39.674 --> 03:13:40.942
THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE AND SO WE

03:13:41.009 --> 03:13:42.043
STARTED DOING THAT FOR FEDERAL

03:13:42.110 --> 03:13:43.678
CLEMENCY RECIPIENTS SO WE WOULD

03:13:43.745 --> 03:13:46.047
HAVE OUR TEAM OF FORMERLY

03:13:46.114 --> 03:13:47.215
INCARCERATED GO MEET THEM.

03:13:47.282 --> 03:13:48.950
PICK THEM UP THE VAST MAJORITY

03:13:49.017 --> 03:13:50.552
OF THESE FEDERAL INMATES WOULD

03:13:50.618 --> 03:13:51.553
GO ON TO WHAT'S CALLED OF

03:13:51.619 --> 03:13:55.223
RESIDENTIAL REENTRY CENTER RC.

03:13:55.290 --> 03:13:56.191
TWO IF YOU'RE A FEDERAL INMATE

03:13:56.257 --> 03:13:57.559
WE FOUND IT AMAZING TO KNOW THAT.

03:13:57.625 --> 03:13:59.027
OUR CLIENTS WERE ACTUALLY GOING

03:13:59.094 --> 03:14:01.029
SOME PLACE WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE

03:14:01.096 --> 03:14:02.564
SECURITY WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE.

03:14:02.630 --> 03:14:04.766
SOME STRUCTURE WHERE THEY

03:14:04.833 --> 03:14:05.500
WOULDN'T BE A BURDEN ON THEIR

03:14:05.567 --> 03:14:06.968
FAMILIES WHERE THEY HAVE ACCESS

03:14:07.035 --> 03:14:08.269
TO SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER

03:14:08.336 --> 03:14:09.371
PROGRAMMING WHERE THEY WOULD

03:14:09.437 --> 03:14:10.705
HAVE THE ABILITY TO GET THEIR

03:14:10.772 --> 03:14:13.041
DRIVER'S LICENSE OR SOCIAL

03:14:13.108 --> 03:14:14.442
SECURITY CARD IN THERE IS THAT

03:14:14.509 --> 03:14:15.377
ALL THE PAPERWORK THAT THEY NEED.

03:14:15.443 --> 03:14:16.411
AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOME

03:14:16.478 --> 03:14:19.080
VOCATIONAL TRAINING AND TO WORK

03:14:19.147 --> 03:14:22.684
WITHIN THE COMMUNITY.

03:14:22.751 --> 03:14:25.387
I'M WE FOUND THAT MODEL.

03:14:25.453 --> 03:14:27.756
WELL SOMEWHAT -- UNEVENLY

03:14:27.822 --> 03:14:30.025
ADMINISTERED EVERY STATE HAD

03:14:30.091 --> 03:14:31.693
THERE ARE SEASON EVERYBODY HAD

03:14:31.760 --> 03:14:32.961
ACCESS TO THE R. C. ANYBODY WAS

03:14:33.028 --> 03:14:34.095
COMING OUT COULD GO AND MOST DID

03:14:34.162 --> 03:14:36.831
GO TO THE R. C..

03:14:36.898 --> 03:14:38.366
AND WE FELT THAT THAT REALLY WAS.

03:14:38.433 --> 03:14:40.001
AN INCREDIBLE.

03:14:40.068 --> 03:14:41.669
VALUE AND A RELIEF TO THEM TO

03:14:41.736 --> 03:14:43.038
KNOW THAT THEY HAD A PLACE TO GO.

03:14:43.104 --> 03:14:44.706
AND THAT THAT PLACE WAS GOING TO

03:14:44.773 --> 03:14:46.908
SUPPORT THEM IN THEIR SOBRIETY

03:14:46.975 --> 03:14:48.943
GOALS IN THEIR LOCATION UNCLES

03:14:49.010 --> 03:14:51.312
IN THEIR BEHAVIOR REHABILITATION

03:14:51.379 --> 03:14:52.714
GOALS.

03:14:52.781 --> 03:14:54.015
SO THAT I THINK.

03:14:54.082 --> 03:14:55.150
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IS AN IDEAL

03:14:55.216 --> 03:14:56.985
MODEL HAVING SOMETHING LIKE THAT

03:14:57.052 --> 03:14:58.453
IN EVERY COUNTY THAT HAD

03:14:58.520 --> 03:15:01.022
CAPACITY BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT'S

03:15:01.089 --> 03:15:03.525
BEEN -- SORT OF INTIMATED THAT

03:15:03.591 --> 03:15:04.492
THERE'S A GREAT.

03:15:04.559 --> 03:15:06.795
NEED FOR MORE OF THESE THAT

03:15:06.861 --> 03:15:08.563
THESE SERVICES AND FOR LONGER

03:15:08.630 --> 03:15:10.331
PERIODS OF TIME.

03:15:10.398 --> 03:15:11.299
KNOW WHAT'S ONE OF THE MODELS

03:15:11.366 --> 03:15:14.402
WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY LOOK TO

03:15:14.469 --> 03:15:16.371
WHERE THIS IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING.

03:15:16.438 --> 03:15:19.274
THE CZ TRP THEN THE M. C. R.

03:15:19.340 --> 03:15:21.509
PAYS THAT WAY THEY HAVE THEY

03:15:21.576 --> 03:15:22.143
ALREADY DO IT AND I THINK THAT.

03:15:22.210 --> 03:15:26.481
I THINK YOU KNOW ONE OF THE AND

03:15:26.548 --> 03:15:29.184
NOW THIS GETS WILL.

03:15:29.250 --> 03:15:29.651
WILL.

03:15:29.717 --> 03:15:32.053
OUT THERE A LITTLE BIT BUT IF WE

03:15:32.120 --> 03:15:33.855
BECAUSE THEY'RE INMATES WHEN

03:15:33.922 --> 03:15:34.389
THEY WHEN THEY'RE IN THESE

03:15:34.456 --> 03:15:34.889
PROGRAMS.

03:15:34.956 --> 03:15:35.490
THEN THEY'RE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR

03:15:35.557 --> 03:15:37.192
MEDICAL SERVICES SO I THINK THAT

03:15:37.258 --> 03:15:37.759
IF THERE WAS A WAY YOU TALK

03:15:37.826 --> 03:15:38.359
ABOUT LEGISLATIVELY HOW COULD

03:15:38.426 --> 03:15:38.760
YOU DO SOMETHING.

03:15:38.827 --> 03:15:40.061
IF THERE WAS A DIFFERENT

03:15:40.128 --> 03:15:42.764
DESIGNATION -- AND THEY WEREN'T

03:15:42.831 --> 03:15:43.698
NECESSARILY INMATES NUMBER ONE

03:15:43.765 --> 03:15:45.333
THEIR HEALTHCARE COSTS WOULD GET

03:15:45.400 --> 03:15:46.401
PAID FOR THROUGH MEDICARE ALL

03:15:46.468 --> 03:15:48.303
INSTEAD OF CDC ARE -- YOU CAN

03:15:48.369 --> 03:15:49.971
ALSO IT WOULDN'T BE A PANACEA SO

03:15:50.038 --> 03:15:51.172
WOULDN'T COVER EVERY PLACE BUT

03:15:51.239 --> 03:15:52.874
YOU COULD LEVERAGE MEDI CAL FOR

03:15:52.941 --> 03:15:54.008
TREATMENT SERVICES IN CERTAIN

03:15:54.075 --> 03:15:56.077
LOCATIONS -- THAT COULD REDUCE

03:15:56.144 --> 03:15:59.380
SOME COST I THINK ALSO THERE WAS --

03:15:59.447 --> 03:16:01.015
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT AND AND I

03:16:01.082 --> 03:16:02.884
THINK IT WAS ALREADY SPOKE ABOUT

03:16:02.951 --> 03:16:04.219
WITH?

03:16:04.285 --> 03:16:05.954
THE S. A. T. F. WHEN YOU'RE IN

03:16:06.020 --> 03:16:07.322
YOU'RE IN CUSTODY PROGRAMS IF

03:16:07.388 --> 03:16:10.658
YOU CAN HOUSE PEOPLE IN THE

03:16:10.725 --> 03:16:13.862
PROGRAM TOGETHER -- AND HOUSE

03:16:13.928 --> 03:16:14.729
THEM TOGETHER WHEN THEY'RE IN

03:16:14.796 --> 03:16:15.630
THE PROGRAM TO KEEP THEM HOUSE

03:16:15.697 --> 03:16:15.897
TOGETHER.

03:16:15.964 --> 03:16:19.234
AND IF THEY AND IF THEY IF THEY

03:16:19.300 --> 03:16:23.004
PAROLE FROM THAT PROGRAM BECAUSE

03:16:23.071 --> 03:16:24.105
ONE YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO

03:16:24.172 --> 03:16:26.708
THINK OF IT KIND OF JUST.

03:16:26.774 --> 03:16:28.676
TEN IN GENERAL TERMS IF YOU ARE.

03:16:28.743 --> 03:16:30.545
IF.

03:16:30.612 --> 03:16:32.113
IF YOU HAVE AN ALCOHOLIC AND HE

03:16:32.180 --> 03:16:33.081
GOES TO TREATMENT DO YOU WANT

03:16:33.148 --> 03:16:34.883
THAT ALCOHOLIC TO GO FROM

03:16:34.949 --> 03:16:36.784
OUTPATIENT TREATMENT BACK TO AN

03:16:36.851 --> 03:16:37.952
ALCOHOLIC HOME.

03:16:38.019 --> 03:16:39.654
EVERY NIGHT.

03:16:39.721 --> 03:16:41.689
NO YOU DON'T THAT'S NOT THE BEST

03:16:41.756 --> 03:16:44.626
CASE SCENARIO -- FOR CAN THEY

03:16:44.692 --> 03:16:45.426
MAKE IT.

03:16:45.493 --> 03:16:47.095
CERTAINLY THERE'S BEEN PEOPLE

03:16:47.162 --> 03:16:48.263
THAT HAVE DONE IT.

03:16:48.329 --> 03:16:49.797
BUT DOES THE STATE STATISTICS

03:16:49.864 --> 03:16:51.766
SAY THAT IT'S A LOT MORE

03:16:51.833 --> 03:16:54.269
DIFFICULT YES IT IS AND SO IF WE

03:16:54.335 --> 03:16:56.204
IF WE TAKE SOMEBODY THAT'S IN A

03:16:56.271 --> 03:16:57.505
PROGRAM.

03:16:57.572 --> 03:16:59.340
AND THEN YOU PUT HIM BACKINTO A

03:16:59.407 --> 03:17:01.209
MIXED HOUSING UNIT WORK NOW I

03:17:01.276 --> 03:17:03.211
HAVE TO ACT THIS WAY SO I GOT A

03:17:03.278 --> 03:17:05.180
PROTECT MYSELF HERE.

03:17:05.246 --> 03:17:06.247
AND THEN I'M SUPPOSED TO GO AND

03:17:06.314 --> 03:17:07.215
FLIPPED THE LIGHT SWITCH WHEN I

03:17:07.282 --> 03:17:08.850
GO BACK TO PROGRAM.

03:17:08.917 --> 03:17:10.285
IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT AND

03:17:10.351 --> 03:17:10.785
THEY'RE ALREADY HAVING A

03:17:10.852 --> 03:17:12.353
DIFFICULT TIME.

03:17:12.420 --> 03:17:13.888
AND SO THEN.

03:17:13.955 --> 03:17:16.391
SO THEN TO WHAT I TALKED ABOUT

03:17:16.457 --> 03:17:17.992
THE THE SEAMLESS EPISODE THEN TO

03:17:18.059 --> 03:17:18.993
TAKE THEM INCOMPLETE THAT

03:17:19.060 --> 03:17:20.261
PROGRAM AND THEIR SENTENCE NOT

03:17:20.328 --> 03:17:23.765
BE DONE YET. TO PUT THEM BACK IN

03:17:23.831 --> 03:17:25.400
THE GENERAL POPULATION YOU'VE

03:17:25.466 --> 03:17:26.834
KIND OF SUCK THAT.

03:17:26.901 --> 03:17:28.703
EVERYTHING BACK OUT OF THEM --

03:17:28.770 --> 03:17:30.038
AND IT AND IT'S HARD CAN THEY

03:17:30.104 --> 03:17:30.972
STILL MAKE IT YES THERE'S A

03:17:31.039 --> 03:17:32.373
GIVEN THE BEST RESULTS NO I

03:17:32.440 --> 03:17:34.275
DON'T THINK SO -- AND I THINK

03:17:34.342 --> 03:17:36.377
THAT WE'VE TALKED WITH THE RP

03:17:36.444 --> 03:17:36.978
ABOUT I THINK THAT THEY AGREE

03:17:37.045 --> 03:17:37.912
WITH US.

03:17:37.979 --> 03:17:38.580
AND I THINK THAT THEY'RE LOOKING

03:17:38.646 --> 03:17:40.848
AT HOW CAN HOW CAN THEY DO THAT

03:17:40.915 --> 03:17:41.349
HOW CAN THEY MAKE THOSE

03:17:41.416 --> 03:17:42.350
ADJUSTMENTS.

03:17:42.417 --> 03:17:44.085
BUT I DO THINK THAT THE YOU KNOW

03:17:44.152 --> 03:17:45.753
THE STOP ARE A GREAT EXAMPLE OF

03:17:45.820 --> 03:17:48.156
PROGRAMS THAT ARE SUCCESSFUL THE

03:17:48.223 --> 03:17:49.757
THE M. C. R. PEAS IN THE C. C.

03:17:49.824 --> 03:17:50.291
T. R. PEAS.

03:17:50.358 --> 03:17:51.559
ARE REALLY GOOD EXAMPLES OF

03:17:51.626 --> 03:17:53.261
WHERE YOU CAN TAKE THE IN THE

03:17:53.328 --> 03:17:54.629
SOMEBODY SENTENCE AND RE

SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR SO THAT --

03:24:07.802 --> 03:24:09.670

WOMEN WHO ARE INCARCERATED.

03:24:44.572 --> 03:24:46.374
ARE GOING OUT OF THEIR WAY. TO

03:24:46.440 --> 03:24:48.576
GET THESE PROGRAMS TO CUT DOWN

03:24:48.643 --> 03:24:49.910
THERE THE THIRD TIME THE CREDIT

03:24:49.977 --> 03:24:51.579
TIME AND ALL OF THAT SO YOU CAN

03:24:51.646 --> 03:24:53.147
GET OUT AND GET RECONNECTED TO

03:24:53.214 --> 03:24:53.814
HER FAMILY.

03:24:53.881 --> 03:24:55.583
BECAUSE ONCE YOU'RE DISCONNECTED

03:24:55.650 --> 03:24:58.419
FROM YOUR FAMILY YOU'RE.

03:24:58.486 --> 03:25:00.187
YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE IN THAT.

03:25:00.254 --> 03:25:01.055
YOU'RE CUTTING THAT PRISON

03:25:01.122 --> 03:25:02.590
POPULATION MENTALITY YOU DON'T

03:25:02.657 --> 03:25:04.158
WANT TO GET OUT AND SO HOW DO WE

03:25:04.225 --> 03:25:05.726
HOW DO WE FIGURE THAT OUT.

03:25:05.793 --> 03:25:07.695
SO WE CAN MAYBE IT'S TO DO THAT

03:25:07.762 --> 03:25:10.264
AND CDC ARE -- SO SOON IN IN THE

03:25:10.331 --> 03:25:12.299
WOMEN'S FACILITIES -- AND I

03:25:12.366 --> 03:25:15.403
THINK WE COULD GET SOME AMAZING --

03:25:15.469 --> 03:25:18.305
RESULTS FROM THAT IF WE WERE.

03:25:18.372 --> 03:25:21.108
TO HAVE WOMEN -- STAY CONNECTED

03:25:21.175 --> 03:25:21.676
TO THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR

03:25:21.742 --> 03:25:22.977
FAMILIES.

03:25:23.044 --> 03:25:25.312
SO PICK ONE ANYONE OR JUST.

03:25:25.379 --> 03:25:26.914
IN GENERAL START WITH THE FIRST

03:25:26.981 --> 03:25:28.015
THE FIRST ONE IN TERMS AYE

03:25:28.082 --> 03:25:29.850
UTILIZES OF HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS

03:25:29.917 --> 03:25:31.419
I THINK THAT IS THE APPROPRIATE

03:25:31.485 --> 03:25:32.887
APPROACH IS TO WORK WITH LOCAL

03:25:32.953 --> 03:25:34.522
RESOURCES IN TERMS OF COUNTY AS

03:25:34.588 --> 03:25:35.923

03:25:35.990 --> 03:25:36.857
ANGELES.

03:25:36.924 --> 03:25:37.625
WITH THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH

03:25:37.692 --> 03:25:39.160
SERVICES SO INDIVIDUALS LIKE

YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT

03:25:40.294 --> 03:25:40.928
SHOULDN'T BE IN THE PRISON

03:25:40.995 --> 03:25:42.997
SYSTEM AND ARE BETTER SERVED IN

03:25:43.064 --> 03:25:44.832
A COMMUNITY BASED SETTING WITH

03:25:44.899 --> 03:25:45.566
WRAPAROUND.

03:25:45.633 --> 03:25:47.368
COMPREHENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT

03:25:47.435 --> 03:25:48.669
HEALTH CARE SERVICES TIED TO

03:25:48.736 --> 03:25:50.571
THEM IS A MUCH BETTER APPROACH

03:25:50.638 --> 03:25:52.406
AND WERE SEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL

03:25:52.473 --> 03:25:53.708
RESULTS IN THAT LOS ANGELES I'D

03:25:53.774 --> 03:25:54.608
BE HAPPY.

03:25:54.675 --> 03:25:55.876
TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU IN TERMS

03:25:55.943 --> 03:25:57.845
OF THE LIFERS WORK WITH A OR C.

03:25:57.912 --> 03:26:00.281
ON THAT PROGRAM AND SUPPORT THEM

03:26:00.347 --> 03:26:01.782
THERE ARE A A WONDERFUL

03:26:01.849 --> 03:26:03.217
ORGANIZATION I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH

03:26:03.284 --> 03:26:05.553
ABOUT LIFERS WE ACTUALLY HIRE.

03:26:05.619 --> 03:26:06.721
A NUMBER OF FORMER LIFERS AN

03:26:06.787 --> 03:26:09.156
ORGANIZATION WE HAVE A FACILITY

03:26:09.223 --> 03:26:10.558
THAT'S ENTIRELY DEDICATED TO

03:26:10.624 --> 03:26:12.626
FORMER LIFERS THERE WE JUST OPEN

03:26:12.693 --> 03:26:13.961
IT THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS

03:26:14.028 --> 03:26:15.763
WHAT WORKED WITH US ON ABOUT SIX

03:26:15.830 --> 03:26:16.597
MONTHS AGO.

03:26:16.664 --> 03:26:18.232
AND THAT'S A WONDERFUL PROGRAM

03:26:18.299 --> 03:26:20.401
AS YOU HEARD SECRETARY IDEAS SAY

03:26:20.468 --> 03:26:22.737
THE RETURN RATE FOR LIFERS IS

03:26:22.803 --> 03:26:25.740
ABOUT 3% BUT THE MARGIN OF ERROR.

03:26:25.806 --> 03:26:28.409
WITH SERVING LIFERS IS EVEN LESS

03:26:28.476 --> 03:26:29.276
THAN THAT SO WE HAVE TO BE

03:26:29.343 --> 03:26:31.011
CAREFUL IN TERMS OF PROVIDING

03:26:31.078 --> 03:26:32.413
THOSE SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY.

03:26:32.480 --> 03:26:34.281
BUT THEY'RE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT

03:26:34.348 --> 03:26:36.183
PART OF OUR WORK FORCE IN THEIR

03:26:36.250 --> 03:26:37.418
EIGHT EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL IN

03:26:37.485 --> 03:26:38.919
TERMS OF MENTORING A YOUNGER

03:26:38.986 --> 03:26:40.621
GENERATION OF PEOPLE THAT ARE

03:26:40.688 --> 03:26:42.022
COMING THROUGH THE SYSTEM NOW.

03:26:42.089 --> 03:26:43.824
ANY THAT SUPPORT AND THEN I'LL

03:26:43.891 --> 03:26:45.025
JUST SAY FINALLY BECAUSE OF

03:26:45.092 --> 03:26:46.927
COURSE I WAS IMPACTED BY

03:26:46.994 --> 03:26:48.095
PROGRAMS LIKE THAT.

03:26:48.162 --> 03:26:49.363
I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT FAMILY

03:26:49.430 --> 03:26:50.931
REUNIFICATION PROGRAMS I BELIEVE

03:26:50.998 --> 03:26:52.833
THERE'S A VERY SMALL ONE THAT

03:26:52.900 --> 03:26:55.336
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ALLOWS

03:26:55.402 --> 03:26:57.705
FOR UP TO FIVE YEARS I BELIEVE --

03:26:57.772 --> 03:26:59.039
WHILE THEY'RE STILL INCARCERATED

03:26:59.106 --> 03:27:01.375
I CAN'T THINK OF THE ACRONYM FOR

03:27:01.442 --> 03:27:02.009
RIGHT NOW YOU CAN FIND IT OUT

03:27:02.076 --> 03:27:03.544
LET ME KNOW AND THAT OUT AND I

03:27:03.611 --> 03:27:05.513
BELIEVE THERE'S ABOUT TWENTY

03:27:05.579 --> 03:27:07.882
FIVE THIRTY BEDS -- IN LA COUNTY

03:27:07.948 --> 03:27:08.883
I BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE OPERATING

03:27:08.949 --> 03:27:11.218
WITH ACTUALLY ALLOW WOMEN TO

03:27:11.285 --> 03:27:11.752
REUNITE WITH THEIR FAMILY

03:27:11.819 --> 03:27:13.320
MEMBERS BUT WOULD LOVE TO SEE

03:27:13.387 --> 03:27:15.356
MORE OF THOSE KIND OF PROGRAMS

03:27:15.422 --> 03:27:16.524
AND THEY HAVE PROGRAMS LIKE

03:27:16.590 --> 03:27:17.691
PHOTO.

03:27:17.758 --> 03:27:23.364
THAT ACTUALLY ALLOW WOMEN.

03:27:23.430 --> 03:27:23.898
TO I'M OUT ON ALTERNATIVE

03:27:23.964 --> 03:27:24.865
CUSTODY ANKLE MONITORS AND

03:27:24.932 --> 03:27:25.966
REUNITE WE ACTUALLY FUND THOSE

03:27:26.033 --> 03:27:26.934
PROGRAMS THERE ARE STOP SERVICES

03:27:27.001 --> 03:27:28.569
AND SHAUN DOES AS WELL.

03:27:28.636 --> 03:27:29.436
IN THE COST OF THAT IS

03:27:29.503 --> 03:27:30.905
SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN BEING

03:27:30.971 --> 03:27:32.606
INCARCERATE YES AND THE IMPACT

03:27:32.673 --> 03:27:34.742
IS IMMEASURABLE IN SOME CASES

03:27:34.809 --> 03:27:36.243
LIKE I MENTIONED YOU KNOW THAT

03:27:36.310 --> 03:27:38.646
NOBODY EVER TRACKS WHAT THE TRUE

03:27:38.712 --> 03:27:40.181
COST IS TO A FAMILY.

03:27:40.247 --> 03:27:41.749
WITH THE TRUE IMPACT IS TO THE

03:27:41.816 --> 03:27:42.683
CHILDREN THAT ARE ACTUALLY

03:27:42.750 --> 03:27:44.151
BROUGHT THROUGH THOSE SERVICES

03:27:44.218 --> 03:27:45.252
AND WE ALWAYS FOCUS ON THE

03:27:45.319 --> 03:27:46.754
INDIVIDUAL THAT'S INCARCERATED

03:27:46.821 --> 03:27:47.822
WHICH IS GOOD.

03:27:47.888 --> 03:27:49.190
BUT THERE'S SO MANY -- INDIRECT

03:27:49.256 --> 03:27:50.491
RIPPLE EFFECTS OF IN TERMS OF

03:27:50.558 --> 03:27:53.027
PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES

03:27:53.093 --> 03:27:55.563
SUCCESSFULLY IN THE COMMUNITY.

03:27:55.629 --> 03:27:57.064
CAN I MAKE THAT YOUR DAD ON TO

03:27:57.131 --> 03:27:58.065
THE TO LIVE FOR PEACE THERE

THOSE ARE THE MOST -- MOTIVATED

03:28:00.167 --> 03:28:01.802
INDIVIDUALS YOU'LL SEE THEY THEY

03:28:01.869 --> 03:28:03.003
KNOW THEY GOT THEIR ONE CHANCE

03:28:03.070 --> 03:28:05.439
THIS IS MY ONE SHOT AND I'M NOT

03:28:05.506 --> 03:28:06.040

THEIR SERIOUS -- THEY KNOW WHAT

03:28:10.678 --> 03:28:11.579
THEY WANT TO DO AND I THINK THE

03:28:11.645 --> 03:28:12.947

03:30:51.605 --> 03:30:53.574
IF YOU WERE SITTING IN MY CLASS

03:30:53.640 --> 03:30:56.377

LIKE IN A P. I. A PROGRAM.

03:30:58.245 --> 03:30:59.947
AND THE REASON I I KIND OF SAY

03:31:00.014 --> 03:31:03.984
THAT LIKE FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT NOW --

03:31:04.051 --> 03:31:07.054
I AM THE TUTOR FOR THE

03:31:07.121 --> 03:31:08.288
ELECTRONICS TEACHER.

03:31:08.355 --> 03:31:10.624
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T HAVE THE TIME

03:31:10.691 --> 03:31:13.594
TO TEACH MATH AND SCIENCE AT THE

03:31:13.660 --> 03:31:15.963
SAME TIME TEACHING ELECTRONIC SO

03:31:16.030 --> 03:31:17.464
AS A VOCATIONAL TEACHER.

03:31:17.531 --> 03:31:19.366
MUST MY SCHEDULES A LITTLE BIT

03:31:19.433 --> 03:31:20.367
MORE FLEXIBLE SO I CAN GO OVER

03:31:20.434 --> 03:31:21.668

AND WHAT HAVE YOU.

03:31:25.272 --> 03:31:27.474
BUT IT ISN'T BECAUSE THE

03:31:27.541 --> 03:31:31.979
ACADEMIC TEACHERS -- DON'T HAVE

03:31:32.046 --> 03:31:34.248
THE RESOURCES OR WHAT HAVE YOU

03:31:34.314 --> 03:31:36.216
IT'S JUST THAT THERE'S A SLIGHT

03:31:36.283 --> 03:31:38.252
DISCONNECT FOR EXAMPLE.

03:31:38.318 --> 03:31:39.920
THIS YOUNG MAN THAT I'M TEACHING

03:31:39.987 --> 03:31:42.456
IN THIS -- VOCATIONAL CLASS OR

03:31:42.523 --> 03:31:42.956
IN THE ELECTRONICS CLASS

03:31:43.023 --> 03:31:45.192
SHOULDN'T EVER BEEN CLASSIFIED

03:31:45.259 --> 03:31:46.326
TO BE IN THAT CLASS.

03:31:46.393 --> 03:31:48.595
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

03:31:48.662 --> 03:31:50.230
SO THERE'S A SLIGHT DISCONNECT

03:31:50.297 --> 03:31:51.732
BUT AT THE SAME TIME BE

03:31:51.799 --> 03:31:53.600
ACADEMICS ARE DOING I THINK A

03:31:53.667 --> 03:31:54.968
BANG UP JOB FOR THE DEPARTMENT

03:31:55.035 --> 03:31:56.870
OF CORRECTIONS I'M SURE THAT THE

03:31:56.937 --> 03:31:57.971
NEW DIRECTOR IS.

03:31:58.038 --> 03:31:59.506
SENDING US THE RESOURCES THAT WE

03:31:59.573 --> 03:32:02.242
NEED BUT AT THE SAME TIME I

03:32:02.309 --> 03:32:04.878
THINK THAT MAY BE.

03:32:04.945 --> 03:32:07.514
WHEN THEY DID THEIR OF STUDY

03:32:07.581 --> 03:32:09.783
WHATEVER I'D LIKE I'D I'D BE

03:32:09.850 --> 03:32:11.752
CURIOUS TO KNOW WHO THEY TALK?

03:32:11.819 --> 03:32:13.387
TO I REALLY WOULD BECAUSE I

03:32:13.454 --> 03:32:15.222
COULD HEAR.

03:32:15.289 --> 03:32:17.624
MISSISSAUGA ASKING OKAY.

03:32:17.691 --> 03:32:19.126
WHAT I GET THE WAGES I GET THAT

03:32:19.193 --> 03:32:20.894
THIS BUT HOW ARE YOU HELPING

03:32:20.961 --> 03:32:23.664
THESE GUYS WHAT ARE YOU DOING

03:32:23.730 --> 03:32:25.599
BEYOND THE WAGES?

03:32:25.666 --> 03:32:27.401
I THINK THE ACADEMIC OUTAGES AT

03:32:27.468 --> 03:32:28.902
PELICAN BAY ARE DOING THAT.

03:32:28.969 --> 03:32:30.604
AGAIN THERE'S SOME DISCONNECTS

03:32:30.671 --> 03:32:31.605
IN THERE AND EVERYTHING RIGHT

03:32:31.672 --> 03:32:33.640
THERE BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE

03:32:33.707 --> 03:32:35.242
PROGRAMS LIKE P. I. E. AND THE

03:32:35.309 --> 03:32:36.110
OTHER THINGS THAT THEY'RE

03:32:36.176 --> 03:32:37.511
WORKING WITH IT'S LIKE COMPARING

03:32:37.578 --> 03:32:39.313
APPLES AND ORANGES.

03:32:39.379 --> 03:32:41.448
I'M NOT SIT IN THE CLASS.

03:32:41.515 --> 03:32:43.517
MAKING NO MONEY.

03:32:43.584 --> 03:32:45.119
OR I CAN GO SIT OVER IN THIS

03:32:45.185 --> 03:32:46.019
CLASS.

03:32:46.086 --> 03:32:47.521
MAKE A DOLLAR AN HOUR.

03:32:47.588 --> 03:32:50.357
AND THEN I HEARD THEM SAY A 7%

03:32:50.424 --> 03:32:53.827
RECIDIVISM RATE.

03:32:53.894 --> 03:32:55.762
WHERE YOU GET THAT NUMBER IT?

03:32:55.829 --> 03:32:58.065
IS THIS SELF REPORTED.

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:16.201
FOR USE WHEN THEY ARE IN HOME

00:27:16.267 --> 00:27:18.236
BASED FAMILY CARE SITUATIONS

00:27:18.303 --> 00:27:23.408
WITH IT WITH A A MORE LIMITED --

00:27:23.475 --> 00:27:24.309
GROUP GROUP AROUND THEM -- THAT

00:27:24.376 --> 00:27:25.443
THEY CAN BE CARED FOR YOU

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:26.678
OBVIOUSLY CAN'T JUST TAKE KIDS

00:27:26.745 --> 00:27:28.513
OUT OF A GROUP HOME YOU HAVE TO

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:29.914
HAVE SOME PLACE TO PUT THEM.

00:27:29.981 --> 00:27:31.950
SO THAT WAS THE REFLECTION IN

00:27:32.017 --> 00:27:33.485
THE INITIAL INVESTMENTS MADE IN

00:27:33.551 --> 00:27:36.454
THE C. C. R. IN TERMS OF FAMILY --

00:27:36.521 --> 00:27:38.156
RECRUITMENT RETENTION AND

00:27:38.223 --> 00:27:39.391
SUPPORT.

00:27:39.457 --> 00:27:41.493
IN -- RE RE CASTING THE

00:27:41.559 --> 00:27:43.395
EXPECTATIONS OF THE VARIOUS

00:27:43.461 --> 00:27:45.030
FACILITY TYPES THAT WE HAVE.

00:27:45.096 --> 00:27:46.798
A MAKING SETTING THE EXPECTATION

00:27:46.865 --> 00:27:48.400
THAT GROUP HOMES WOULD BE PHASED

00:27:48.466 --> 00:27:49.868
OUT IN THE CHILD WELFARE ARENA

00:27:49.934 --> 00:27:50.935
IN FAVOR OF SHORT TERM

00:27:51.002 --> 00:27:53.838
RESIDENTIAL THERAPEUTIC PROGRAMS --

00:27:53.905 --> 00:27:55.206
I DON'T WANT TO USE THE WORD

00:27:55.273 --> 00:27:56.941
CRISIS STABILIZATION BUT THEY

00:27:57.008 --> 00:27:58.143
WERE ENVISIONED AS SIX MONTHS

00:27:58.209 --> 00:27:59.878
MAXIMUM PLACEMENTS AND LAST

00:27:59.944 --> 00:28:01.079
THOSE STRENGTHS AND NEEDS OF THE

00:28:01.146 --> 00:28:03.248
CHILD AND YOUTH INDICATED A

00:28:03.314 --> 00:28:04.616
LONGER PERIOD OF TIME WAS NEEDED.

00:28:04.682 --> 00:28:06.217
AND THAT REALLY THE FOCUS OF OUR

00:28:06.284 --> 00:28:08.853
EFFORT WAS TO GET HOME BASE

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:12.457
FAMILY KERR -- WE HAVE GONE TO

00:28:12.524 --> 00:28:14.526
SINCE JANUARY TWENTY FIFTEEN

00:28:14.592 --> 00:28:15.927
THROUGH SEVERAL YEARS OF POLICY

00:28:15.994 --> 00:28:18.196
DEVELOPMENT AND GUIDANCE A LOT

00:28:18.263 --> 00:28:20.298
OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE -- WITH

00:28:20.365 --> 00:28:22.067
COUNTIES WITH PROVIDERS IN THE

00:28:22.133 --> 00:28:24.135
SYSTEM AND WE'VE BEEN MOVE NOW

00:28:24.202 --> 00:28:25.670
BEYOND THE JUST THE POLICY

00:28:25.737 --> 00:28:27.272
DEVELOPMENT AND INTO THE

00:28:27.338 --> 00:28:29.274
IMPLEMENTATION PHASE AND MORE

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:30.608
NOW A COUPLE YEARS INTO THAT.

00:28:30.675 --> 00:28:32.277
AND YOU'LL SEE THAT REFLECTED IN

00:28:32.343 --> 00:28:35.380
THE IN THE FUNDING -- THAT THAT --

00:28:35.447 --> 00:28:38.583
IS IS PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET AND

00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:40.018
HAS BEEN PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET --

00:28:40.085 --> 00:28:42.187
IN ADDITION TO EFFORTS TO A

00:28:42.253 --> 00:28:44.656
RETAIN AND RECRUIT FAMILIES AND

00:28:44.722 --> 00:28:46.658
TO CHANGE THE THE MIX OF

00:28:46.724 --> 00:28:48.126
PROVIDER TYPES AND OUR SERVICE

00:28:48.193 --> 00:28:50.462
EXPECTATIONS OF THOSE PROVIDERS.

00:28:50.528 --> 00:28:51.896
A CHILD AND FAMILY TEAMING

00:28:51.963 --> 00:28:53.998
CONCEPTS WERE A MAJOR FEATURE OF

00:28:54.065 --> 00:28:55.433
THIS IT'S IMPORTANT.

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:56.534
I THINK IT'S NO SECRET TO

00:28:56.601 --> 00:28:57.969
ANYBODY THAT WHEN PEOPLE

00:28:58.036 --> 00:28:59.270
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING TO

00:28:59.337 --> 00:29:00.271
THEM AND THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'VE

00:29:00.338 --> 00:29:02.340
HAD A VOICE AND BEEN ABLE TO BE

00:29:02.407 --> 00:29:03.141
HEARD THEY HAVE MORE BY INTO

00:29:03.208 --> 00:29:04.676
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THEM.

00:29:04.742 --> 00:29:06.311
AND SO CHILD AND FAMILY TEAMING

00:29:06.377 --> 00:29:08.813
AROUND DECISIONS ABOUT PLACEMENT

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:12.884
ABOUT SERVICE NEEDS -- ABOUT

00:29:12.951 --> 00:29:13.785
DURATION OF CARING OVERALL CASE

00:29:13.852 --> 00:29:14.886
MANAGEMENT AND WHAT'S IN A COURT

00:29:14.953 --> 00:29:17.088
REPORT THOSE ARE ALL FEATURES OF

00:29:17.155 --> 00:29:20.758
CHILD AND FAMILY TEAMING.

00:29:20.825 --> 00:29:23.862
EXCUSE ME SACRAMENTO ALLERGIES --

00:29:23.928 --> 00:29:25.797
THE OTHER MAJOR FEATURE -- WELL

00:29:25.864 --> 00:29:27.065
IT WAS A DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW

00:29:27.132 --> 00:29:29.501
RATE SYSTEM FOR ABOUT TWENTY

00:29:29.567 --> 00:29:30.969
YEARS PRIOR TO THIS -- WE'VE HAD

00:29:31.035 --> 00:29:32.804
AN AGE BASED SYSTEM WHERE AS A

00:29:32.871 --> 00:29:34.539
CHILD GOT OLDER RATE RATES

00:29:34.606 --> 00:29:37.542
CHANGED -- WE'VE DOW IMPLEMENTED

00:29:37.609 --> 00:29:38.776
A RATE SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA

00:29:38.843 --> 00:29:41.045
THAT'S BASED ON THE SS STRENGTHS

00:29:41.112 --> 00:29:42.380
AND NEEDS OF THE CHILD.

00:29:42.447 --> 00:29:44.349
AND INTENDED TO BETTER SUPPORT

00:29:44.415 --> 00:29:46.384
FAMILIES -- ROUGHLY A HUNDRED

00:29:46.451 --> 00:29:47.619
AND TEN HUNDRED TWENTY DOLLAR A

00:29:47.685 --> 00:29:49.287
MONTH INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT

00:29:49.354 --> 00:29:50.788
GIVEN TO FAMILIES.

00:29:50.855 --> 00:29:53.625
A CHANGE IN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY

00:29:53.691 --> 00:29:54.993
THAT WE PROVIDE FOR SERVICES AND

00:29:55.059 --> 00:29:57.228
ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT TO FOSTER

00:29:57.295 --> 00:29:58.963
FAMILY AGENCIES -- AND OTHER

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:01.666
CHANGES -- TO FOR EXAMPLE THEY

00:30:01.733 --> 00:30:03.601
THE PHASE OUT OF THE GROUP HOME

00:30:03.668 --> 00:30:05.103
RATES AND REPLACEMENT WITH A

00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:06.771
SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT

00:30:06.838 --> 00:30:09.807
PROGRAM I'M GONNA TRY NOT TO

00:30:09.874 --> 00:30:13.912
CALL THEM S. T. R. T. P. S. --

00:30:13.978 --> 00:30:14.712
AS DESCRIBED IN YOUR AGENDA THEY

00:30:14.779 --> 00:30:16.781
HAVE NEW RATES AS WELL -- THOSE

00:30:16.848 --> 00:30:18.183
THOSE ARE REALLY THE HIGHLIGHTS

00:30:18.249 --> 00:30:19.551
I WANTED TO HIT FOR YOU THERE

00:30:19.617 --> 00:30:21.619
WAS MAYBE ONE OTHER ON PAGE

00:30:21.686 --> 00:30:22.520
THIRTEEN THERE'S A MENTION OF

00:30:22.587 --> 00:30:24.322
ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:25.990
AND THAT'S BEEN A HUGE FOCUS FOR

00:30:26.057 --> 00:30:27.592
MANY YEARS IN CALIFORNIA EVEN

00:30:27.659 --> 00:30:29.827
DATING BEFORE THE C. C. R..

00:30:29.894 --> 00:30:32.430
WE KNEW IT AS KATIE A LITIGATION

00:30:32.497 --> 00:30:33.064
KATIE.

00:30:33.131 --> 00:30:36.267
A WAS THE THE NAME OF THE YOUTH --

00:30:36.334 --> 00:30:38.469
IN THAT LITIGATION -- AND WE'VE

00:30:38.536 --> 00:30:40.405
DONE AND MADE GREAT STRIDES IN

00:30:40.471 --> 00:30:41.806
CALIFORNIA INCREASING THE

00:30:41.873 --> 00:30:44.742
ABILITY OF CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN

00:30:48.046 --> 00:30:49.547
AS I MENTIONED WHEN WE RE CAST

00:30:49.614 --> 00:30:50.848
THE EXPECTATIONS OF OUR SERVICE

00:30:50.915 --> 00:30:53.218

TREATMENT THERAPEUTIC PROGRAMS

00:30:57.589 --> 00:30:58.990
THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER HAVE

00:30:59.057 --> 00:31:00.625
MENTAL HEALTH CONTRACTS AS A AS

00:31:00.692 --> 00:31:03.761
A PRIMARY FOCUS OF THEIR SERVICE

00:31:03.828 --> 00:31:05.063
PREVENTION.

00:31:05.129 --> 00:31:05.830
IN TERMS OF FINDING YOUR CHART

00:31:05.897 --> 00:31:07.865
ON PAGE.

00:31:07.932 --> 00:31:09.400
SIXTEEN OF AT THE TOP THERE ARE

00:31:09.467 --> 00:31:10.935
LATE LAYS OUT THAT THE THE

00:31:11.002 --> 00:31:14.072
RECENT HISTORY AND A PROPOSAL --

00:31:14.138 --> 00:31:16.107
FOR FOR C. C. R. YOU WILL NOTICE

00:31:16.174 --> 00:31:17.508
THE TOP FOUR LINES ALIGNED WITH

00:31:17.575 --> 00:31:19.611
THE MAJOR THEMES THAT I TALKED

00:31:19.677 --> 00:31:21.012
ABOUT THE THE THE RATE CARE --

00:31:21.079 --> 00:31:22.814
PAYMENTS THE CHILD AND FAMILY

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:25.016
TEAMS THE THE SUPPORT FOR FOSTER

00:31:25.083 --> 00:31:27.252
PARENT CARE GIVERS AND RESOURCE

00:31:27.318 --> 00:31:28.987
FAMILY APPROVAL WHAT WE USED TO

00:31:29.053 --> 00:31:30.922
CALL A FOSTER FAMILY HOME IS NOW

00:31:30.989 --> 00:31:33.958
KNOWN AS A RESOURCE -- FAMILY --

00:31:34.025 --> 00:31:35.226
SO THAT'S A TERMINOLOGY CHANGE

00:31:35.293 --> 00:31:36.561
BUT THE CONCEPT IS THE SAME

00:31:36.628 --> 00:31:38.263
THOSE ARE THAT THE HOME BASED

00:31:38.329 --> 00:31:40.698
FAMILY KERR -- PROVIDERS CARE

00:31:40.765 --> 00:31:41.266
GIVERS THAT WE WERE TALKING

00:31:41.332 --> 00:31:42.767
ABOUT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

00:31:42.834 --> 00:31:44.202
OTHER THINGS THAT ARE DISCUSSED

00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:46.804
IN YOUR AGENDA -- THERE'S BEEN A

00:31:46.871 --> 00:31:48.239
LOT OF CHANGE MANAGEMENT THAT'S

00:31:48.306 --> 00:31:50.074
BEEN DIFFICULT UNDERSTANDING

00:31:50.141 --> 00:31:52.076
ROLES AND EXPECTATIONS THE THE

00:31:52.143 --> 00:31:54.545
TRANSFER OF OF FAMILIES FROM A

00:31:54.612 --> 00:31:56.948
FOSTER FAMILY DESIGNATION TO A

00:31:57.015 --> 00:31:58.449
RESOURCE FAMILY DESIGNATION.

00:31:58.516 --> 00:32:00.351
HAS BEEN SLOWER N

00:32:00.418 --> 00:32:02.387
EVERYBODY ANTICIPATED -- THERE'S

00:32:02.453 --> 00:32:03.621
BEEN SOME INVESTMENTS AND BY THE

00:32:03.688 --> 00:32:05.290
LEGISLATURE AND AND THE LAST

00:32:05.356 --> 00:32:06.758
ADMINISTRATION IN THE CURRENT

00:32:06.824 --> 00:32:08.192
BUDGET TO GET -- THROUGH A

00:32:08.259 --> 00:32:10.194
BACKLOG TO APPROVE THOSE MORE

00:32:10.261 --> 00:32:13.231
TIMELY -- BUT THERE WAS A

00:32:13.298 --> 00:32:15.233
FUNDING AUGMENTATION MADE A

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:18.036
COUPLE YEARS NOW -- THAT WE USED

00:32:18.102 --> 00:32:20.772
TO PAY -- FAMILY CARE GIVER WHEN

00:32:20.838 --> 00:32:22.674
THE CHILD I AM SORRY WHEN THEY

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:24.876
HOME WAS APPROVED AS A PLACEMENT.

00:32:24.942 --> 00:32:26.878
BUT VERY OFTEN WE FIND PLACEMENT

00:32:26.944 --> 00:32:29.147
PRIOR TO APPROVAL AND SO THERE

00:32:29.213 --> 00:32:30.148
WAS A PERIOD OF TIME WHERE

00:32:30.214 --> 00:32:31.749
FAMILIES DIDN'T HAVE FINANCIAL

00:32:31.816 --> 00:32:33.217
SUPPORT THAT MAYBE WOULD HAVE

00:32:33.284 --> 00:32:34.185
HELPED THEM.

00:32:34.252 --> 00:32:35.586
EITHER BE A BETTER CARE GIVER OR

00:32:35.653 --> 00:32:37.188
BE WILLING TO ACCEPT A CHILD IN

00:32:37.255 --> 00:32:38.256
THE FIRST PLACE SO THAT'S A

00:32:38.323 --> 00:32:40.391
MAJOR INVESTMENT THE LEVEL OF

00:32:40.458 --> 00:32:41.859
CARE PROTOCOL TOOL HELPS US TO

00:32:41.926 --> 00:32:43.695
SIGN THE NEEDS BASE RATE TO A

00:32:43.761 --> 00:32:44.629
CHILD.

00:32:44.696 --> 00:32:46.064
CANS THE CHILD ASSESSMENT OF

00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:47.699
NEEDS AND STRENGTHS IS THE

00:32:47.765 --> 00:32:48.866
FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT WE'RE

00:32:48.933 --> 00:32:50.702
USING TO IDENTIFY THE NEEDSAND

00:32:50.768 --> 00:32:52.270
STRENGTHS OF THE YOUTH.

00:32:52.337 --> 00:32:53.071
AND THEN THERE ARE THE OTHER

00:32:53.137 --> 00:32:55.006
BUCKET WHICH I WON'T DESCRIBE

00:32:55.073 --> 00:33:00.011
BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY MANY

00:33:00.078 --> 00:33:02.013
THINGS LUMPED INTO THAT -- ON

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.314

OF CARE -- AND AND HOW WE GET

00:33:21.466 --> 00:33:22.800
EVERYBODY WHO NEEDS TO BE

INVOLVED IN THE CARE OF A KID

00:33:24.168 --> 00:33:26.270
THERE'S OBVIOUSLY CROSSOVER A

00:33:26.337 --> 00:33:27.171
FOSTER YOUTH ISN'T JUST A FOSTER

00:33:27.238 --> 00:33:28.406

THE USE.

00:33:42.153 --> 00:33:43.354

THAT WERE POSED INTO THE AGENDA.

00:37:16.701 --> 00:37:17.768
THE THE FIRST TWO QUESTIONS ARE

WE DO KNOW FROM DATA AT THE H.

00:50:55.218 --> 00:50:57.788
C. S. IS THAT A ROUGHLY THREE IN

00:50:57.854 --> 00:50:59.022
TEN KIDS IN OUT OF HOME CARE.

00:50:59.089 --> 00:51:01.525
MEET THE ENGAGEMENT RATE WHICH

00:51:01.591 --> 00:51:02.659
IS A STATE THE TERM RATE -- THAT

00:51:02.726 --> 00:51:04.027
IS THE SORT OF THE METRIC OF

00:51:04.094 --> 00:51:05.495
MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENT IN THE

00:51:05.562 --> 00:51:06.096
SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM

00:51:06.163 --> 00:51:08.865

00:51:08.932 --> 00:51:10.867
A YEAR -- AND SO SEVEN IN TEN

00:51:10.934 --> 00:51:13.303
ARE NOT AND THAT'S IN PART

00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:15.605
BECAUSE AS MR ROSE SAID THAT.

00:51:15.672 --> 00:51:18.375
THE MEDICAL NECESSITY DEFINITION.

00:51:18.442 --> 00:51:21.645
AS IT'S APPLIED SCREENS SOME

00:51:21.711 --> 00:51:23.013
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF KIDS IN

00:51:23.079 --> 00:51:23.780
OUT OF HOME CARE OUT OF THE

00:51:23.847 --> 00:51:25.515
SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM.

00:51:25.582 --> 00:51:27.884

00:51:27.951 --> 00:51:29.853
KIDS NOT GETTING SICK AND TO THE

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:31.555

NOT TO HAVE THE MENTAL HEALTH

00:51:32.889 --> 00:51:34.424
CONVERSATION HERE BECAUSE THE

00:51:34.491 --> 00:51:35.492

AT SOME LENGTH ALL YEAR BUT THIS

00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:41.498
QUESTION OF WHAT IS MEDICAL

TRAUMA OF ABUSE AND NEGLECT AND

00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:51.741
A REMOVAL -- I THINK IT'S A

00:51:51.808 --> 00:51:52.809
SIGNIFICANT ONE FOR THE

00:51:52.876 --> 00:51:54.144
LEGISLATURE BECAUSE IT SEEMS

00:51:54.211 --> 00:51:56.213
COUNTERINTUITIVE AN INCONSISTENT

00:51:56.279 --> 00:51:58.048

FOSTER CARE OF EXPERIENCED.

00:51:59.649 --> 00:52:01.318
THAT THINK THAT SEVEN OUT OF TEN

00:52:01.384 --> 00:52:02.719

DEFINITION OF MEDICAL NECESSITY.

00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:18.101
IS THAT SOMETHING THEM I HOPE WE

00:52:18.168 --> 00:52:20.570

ONE REFORM CC ARE IS NO FEWER

00:59:42.679 --> 00:59:44.614
THAN FIVE MAJOR REFORMS THAT ARE

00:59:44.681 --> 00:59:46.416
ALL BEING UNDERTAKEN AT THE SAME

00:59:46.482 --> 00:59:47.083
TIME.

00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:48.318
WE'RE CHANGING THE WAY WE DO

00:59:48.384 --> 00:59:51.054
SOCIAL WORK WERE CHANGING THE

00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:52.789
NATURE OF RESIDENTIAL.

00:59:52.855 --> 00:59:53.690
CARE INTO INTO SHORT TERM

00:59:53.756 --> 00:59:54.824
TREATMENT WE'RE CHANGING THE WAY

00:59:54.891 --> 00:59:57.060
WE APPROVED FAMILIES WERE

00:59:57.126 --> 00:59:59.095
CHANGING THE LIGHT THE THE RATE

00:59:59.162 --> 01:00:00.530
SYSTEM FOR FAMILIES WERE

01:00:00.596 --> 01:00:04.334
CHANGING THE WAY AND THE NATURE --

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:05.501
BUT TWO OF THE RELATIONSHIP

01:00:05.568 --> 01:00:07.070
BETWEEN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND

01:00:07.136 --> 01:00:09.205
AND CHILD WELFARE AND ALL OF

01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:09.839
THIS IS HAPPENING AT THE SAME

01:00:09.906 --> 01:00:10.740
TIME.

01:00:10.807 --> 01:00:12.508
AND SO I WOULD JUST UNDERSCORE

01:00:12.575 --> 01:00:15.478
WHAT MR JOVANKA SAID THERE'S A

01:00:15.545 --> 01:00:16.379
LOT OF WORK HAPPENING.

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:17.580
ALL THAT BEING SAID I DO THINK

01:00:17.647 --> 01:00:19.182
IT MAKES SENSE TO TAKE SOME

01:00:19.248 --> 01:00:21.217
STOCK AND HOW IT'S GOING WE MADE

01:00:21.284 --> 01:00:23.052
SOME BIG ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT.

01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:24.354
WITH C. C. R. WOULD BE ABLE TO

01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:26.456
PRODUCE AND BY WHEN AND I DO

01:00:26.522 --> 01:00:28.458
THINK THAT IT'S FAIR TO SAY.

01:00:28.524 --> 01:00:30.593
SERVE HOW THE GOING AND AS AS

01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:31.661
YOU MIGHT IMAGINE AND AS WE

01:00:31.728 --> 01:00:33.196
SHOULD PROBABLY EXPECT THERE ARE

01:00:33.262 --> 01:00:34.731
SOME THINGS THAT ARE GOING WELL.

01:00:34.797 --> 01:00:35.898
AND THERE ARE SOME AREAS THAT

01:00:35.965 --> 01:00:37.400
ARE STILL VERY MUCH A WORK IN

01:00:37.467 --> 01:00:39.702
PROGRESS AND PROBABLY GIVE RISE

01:00:39.769 --> 01:00:41.838
TO SOME REASON FOR SOME MID

01:00:41.904 --> 01:00:44.774
COURSE THINKING -- AND SO WE

01:00:44.841 --> 01:00:46.209
SORT OF A LINE WITH MR ROSE A

01:00:46.275 --> 01:00:47.877
SENSE OF OF WHAT'S WHAT'S

01:00:47.944 --> 01:00:49.679
WORKING THE REDUCTION IN THE

01:00:49.746 --> 01:00:50.680
NUMBER OF KIDS IN CONGREGATE

01:00:50.747 --> 01:00:52.448
CARE BOTH PROBATION AND CHILD

01:00:52.515 --> 01:00:53.583
WELFARE KIDS.

01:00:53.649 --> 01:00:55.018
CHILD AND FAMILY TEAMING IS A

01:00:55.084 --> 01:00:56.652
MUCH BETTER WAY OF DOING SOCIAL

01:00:56.719 --> 01:00:58.187
WORK FOR EVERYBODY INVOLVED AND

01:00:58.254 --> 01:01:00.056
THAT'S WELL UNDER WAY THE

01:01:00.123 --> 01:01:02.859
RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL PROCESS.

01:01:02.925 --> 01:01:04.127
AS ARGUE WITH HIM LABOR

01:01:04.193 --> 01:01:06.229
INTENSIVE AS IT IS AND AT GET IT

01:01:06.295 --> 01:01:07.463
SO MUCH MORE WORK THAN WE

01:01:07.530 --> 01:01:09.832
ANTICIPATED TO GET THE EXISTING

01:01:09.899 --> 01:01:10.733
CASES SORT OF THROUGH THE

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:12.035
PIPELINE.

01:01:12.101 --> 01:01:13.736
IT IS A MUCH BETTER WAY. TO

01:01:13.803 --> 01:01:16.139
APPROVE AND SUPPORT FAMILIES

01:01:16.205 --> 01:01:17.840
BECAUSE YOU DO A ROBUST HOME

01:01:17.907 --> 01:01:18.975
ASSESSMENT.

01:01:19.042 --> 01:01:21.444
AND SO CARE GIVERS.

01:01:21.511 --> 01:01:22.745
ARE BETTER ABLE TO CARE FOR

01:01:22.812 --> 01:01:24.447
CHILDREN WHERE BET BETTER ABLE

01:01:24.514 --> 01:01:25.048
TO DETERMINE IF IT'S A RIGHT

01:01:25.114 --> 01:01:27.617
MATCH SO I DON'T WANNA GET LOST

01:01:27.683 --> 01:01:28.618
IN THE DISCUSSION ABOUT OUR A

01:01:28.684 --> 01:01:30.153
FAIT.

01:01:30.219 --> 01:01:32.155
THE VALUE OF OF IT -- AS A

01:01:32.221 --> 01:01:36.225
DIFFERENT AND BETTER WAY OF

01:01:36.292 --> 01:01:38.728
APPROVING RELATIVES -- AND MANY

01:01:38.795 --> 01:01:39.328
FOSTER FAMILY AGENCIES ARE NOW

01:01:39.395 --> 01:01:40.430
STARTING TO INCREASE THE NUMBER

01:01:40.496 --> 01:01:42.732
OF INTENSIVE SERVICES FOSTER

01:01:42.799 --> 01:01:44.033
CARE FAMILIES.

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:45.401
THIS IS ONE OF TWO MAJOR

01:01:45.468 --> 01:01:47.537
CATEGORIES OF FAMILY BASED

01:01:47.603 --> 01:01:49.639
PLACEMENTS THAT CC ARE ASSUMED

01:01:49.705 --> 01:01:51.741
WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR KIDS WHO

01:01:51.808 --> 01:01:53.076
WERE IN LOWER LEVEL GROUP COMES

01:01:53.142 --> 01:01:54.610
BUT SHOULDN'T BE LIVING THERE.

01:01:54.677 --> 01:01:55.812
THEY DON'T THEY DON'T NEED

01:01:55.878 --> 01:01:56.746
TREATMENT BUT THEY SHOULD BE

01:01:56.813 --> 01:01:58.281
WITH FAMILIES AND WE MADE SOME

01:01:58.347 --> 01:01:59.549
ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT.

01:01:59.615 --> 01:02:01.651
BUILDING OUT INTENSIVE SERVICES

01:02:01.717 --> 01:02:03.119
FOSTER CARE AND TREATMENT FOSTER

01:02:03.186 --> 01:02:04.754
CARE WHAT WAS WHICH WAS ACTUALLY

01:02:04.821 --> 01:02:05.822
A REQUIREMENT OF THE KD ES

01:02:05.888 --> 01:02:06.789
SETTLEMENT.

01:02:06.856 --> 01:02:08.791
AN INTENSIVE SERVICES FOSTER

01:02:08.858 --> 01:02:10.359
CARE WE'RE STARTING TO SEE SORT

01:02:10.426 --> 01:02:11.594
OF TAKE OFF.

01:02:11.661 --> 01:02:13.296
THE AREAS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE

01:02:13.362 --> 01:02:14.831
STILL VERY MUCH A WORK AND AND

01:02:14.897 --> 01:02:17.033
AND PROCESS AND THERE ARE SOME

01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:18.167
AREAS OF CONCERN.

01:02:18.234 --> 01:02:19.735
ARE ONES THAT YOU'VE HIGHLIGHTED

01:02:19.802 --> 01:02:20.970
ALREADY ONE IS.

01:02:21.037 --> 01:02:22.472
THE RELATIVELY SLOW RATE OF

01:02:22.538 --> 01:02:24.774
CONVERSION OF GROUP HOMES --

01:02:24.841 --> 01:02:27.877
INTO -- S. T. R. TEEPEES.

01:02:27.944 --> 01:02:29.512
ABOUT HALF OF THE KIDS WHO ARE

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:32.181
IN CONGREGATE CARE ARE IN FILL

01:02:32.248 --> 01:02:33.749
IN FACILITIES RIGHT NOW THAT

01:02:33.816 --> 01:02:36.719
HAVE AN S. T. R. T. P. LICENSE.

01:02:36.786 --> 01:02:39.088
YOU PROVIDED THE AUTHORITY FOR

01:02:39.155 --> 01:02:40.990
US TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW THOSE

01:02:41.057 --> 01:02:42.225
FACILITIES TO CARE FOR THOSE

01:02:42.291 --> 01:02:43.226
CHILDREN.

01:02:43.292 --> 01:02:44.861
UNTIL THE END OF THIS YEAR

01:02:44.927 --> 01:02:46.129
BECAUSE OF THAT.

01:02:46.195 --> 01:02:48.331
SORT OF THAT THAT SLOWER RATE OF

01:02:48.397 --> 01:02:52.502
CONVERSION -- AND WE DO THINK

01:02:52.568 --> 01:02:54.303
THAT FOR MANY OF THOSE

01:02:54.370 --> 01:02:56.005
FACILITIES THEY'RE SMALLER

01:02:56.072 --> 01:02:57.740
FACILITIES THERE COMMUNITY BASED

01:02:57.807 --> 01:02:58.374
FACILITIES.

01:02:58.441 --> 01:03:00.543
MAY.

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:02.979
THEY ARE QUALITY AND THEY COULD

01:03:03.045 --> 01:03:05.314
BE VERY THERAPEUTIC PLACES FOR

01:03:05.381 --> 01:03:06.549
YOU FOR YOU.

01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:08.684
BUT THE STEPS TO BE CALM

01:03:08.751 --> 01:03:10.520
APPROVED ARE NOT INSIGNIFICANT

01:03:10.586 --> 01:03:11.854
MISTER ROSE.

01:03:11.921 --> 01:03:13.656
OUTLINED SORT OF THE THREE THE

01:03:13.723 --> 01:03:15.391
THREE STEPS AND SO THERE'S BEEN

01:03:15.458 --> 01:03:17.160
A LOT OF WORK TO TRY TO HELP

01:03:17.226 --> 01:03:18.661
THOSE FACILITIES.

01:03:18.728 --> 01:03:20.796
ALONG THE PROCESS OF LICENSING

01:03:20.863 --> 01:03:21.964
AND APPROVAL AND THEN

01:03:22.031 --> 01:03:23.266
CONTRACTING.

01:03:23.332 --> 01:03:25.334
BUT I DO THINK IT IT'S TIME AND

01:03:25.401 --> 01:03:27.570
WE ARE BEGINNING TO HAVE THOSE

01:03:27.637 --> 01:03:28.070
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

01:03:28.137 --> 01:03:29.872
ADMINISTRATION. TO THINK ABOUT

01:03:29.939 --> 01:03:31.073
PERHAPS WHETHER WE NEED SOME

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:32.575
MORE INTENSE SEVEN MORE

01:03:32.642 --> 01:03:33.843
INTENTIONAL.

01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:35.978
SORT OF SPECIFIC TRAINING AND

01:03:36.045 --> 01:03:38.181
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR THOSE.

01:03:38.247 --> 01:03:39.749
IN A FACILITY THAT WE REALLY

01:03:39.815 --> 01:03:41.450
BELIEVE ARE IMPORTANT PARTS OF

01:03:41.517 --> 01:03:43.452
THE CARE NETWORK AND WE INTEND

01:03:43.519 --> 01:03:45.188
TO TALK TO THE ADMINISTRATION

01:03:45.254 --> 01:03:45.788
ABOUT.

01:03:45.855 --> 01:03:48.424
IDEAS -- IDEAS FOR DOING JUST

01:03:48.491 --> 01:03:52.762
THAT -- THAT CONTRACTING -- THE

01:03:52.828 --> 01:03:54.263
BEHAVIOR HEALTH CONTRACTING

01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:56.332
ISSUE I THINK IT'S ONE THAT THAT

01:03:56.399 --> 01:03:58.801
BEARS KEEPING OUR EYE ON THERE'S

01:03:58.868 --> 01:04:00.636
ONLY NINETEEN S. T. R. T. PEAS

01:04:00.703 --> 01:04:03.105
IN THE STATE HAVE HAVE PASSED

01:04:03.172 --> 01:04:06.842
ALL THREE STEPS -- AND SO.

01:04:06.909 --> 01:04:09.011
THERE'S ABOUT NINE HUNDRED

01:04:09.078 --> 01:04:10.146
CONGREGATE CARE FACILITIES IN

01:04:10.213 --> 01:04:11.847
THE STATE BUT I SHOULD QUALIFY

01:04:11.914 --> 01:04:12.915
THAT BY SAYING THAT'S NOT

01:04:12.982 --> 01:04:14.250
NECESSARILY TO SAY.

01:04:14.317 --> 01:04:15.818
THAT WE BELIEVE THERE OUGHT TO

01:04:15.885 --> 01:04:19.021
BE NINE HUNDRED BUT BUT NINETEEN

01:04:19.088 --> 01:04:21.991
IS A LOW NUMBER -- AND BOB AS WE

01:04:22.058 --> 01:04:24.360
GET S. T. R. T. PEAS THAT ARE

01:04:24.427 --> 01:04:25.494
IMPORTANT.

01:04:25.561 --> 01:04:27.230
THROUGH THE LICENSING PHASE I

01:04:27.296 --> 01:04:28.965
THINK WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO

01:04:29.031 --> 01:04:30.399
CONTINUE TO PROBLEM SOLVE.

01:04:30.466 --> 01:04:32.134
ABOUT HOW THOSE FACILITIES GET

01:04:32.201 --> 01:04:33.636
MENTAL HEALTH CONTRACTS FROM

01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:35.204
COUNTY MENTAL COUNTY MENTAL

01:04:35.271 --> 01:04:37.073
HEALTH PLANS AND THAT'S AN AREA

01:04:37.139 --> 01:04:38.274
I THINK THE BEARS.

01:04:38.341 --> 01:04:41.777
ARE OUR INTENTIONALITY AND YOUR

01:04:41.844 --> 01:04:43.980
AND AND YOUR OVERSIGHT -- AND

01:04:44.046 --> 01:04:45.481
THEN THE LAST THING I'LL SAY IS

01:04:45.548 --> 01:04:46.716
THEM AJ BUT THEY'RE PEDIC FOSTER

01:04:46.782 --> 01:04:47.917
CARE.

01:04:47.984 --> 01:04:50.953
WAS OF AN OUTCOME OF THE KD ES

01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:52.355
SETTLEMENT THE KATIE A LAWSUIT

01:04:52.421 --> 01:04:53.823
WITH THE LAWSUIT THAT THE STATE

01:04:53.889 --> 01:04:56.826
LOST -- THAT -- FOUND THAT THE

01:04:56.892 --> 01:04:59.762
STATE WAS NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH

01:04:59.829 --> 01:05:01.364
THE FEDERAL EPA STT LAW.

01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:02.531
AND PART OF COMING INTO

01:05:02.598 --> 01:05:04.667
COMPLIANCE WITH WITH THE PST TO

01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:06.369
THE COURT REQUIRED WITH REST

01:05:06.435 --> 01:05:06.969
THAT DEVELOP TREATMENT FOSTER

01:05:07.036 --> 01:05:08.070
CARE.

01:05:08.137 --> 01:05:10.106
AND THAT'S BEEN VERY SLOW TO GET

01:05:10.172 --> 01:05:12.508
OFF THE GROUND AND AND I DON'T

01:05:12.575 --> 01:05:14.176
THINK THAT'S BECAUSE ANYONE'S

01:05:14.243 --> 01:05:18.481
BEEN DRAGGING THEIR FEET -- BUT

01:05:18.547 --> 01:05:20.016
WE MADE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT

01:05:20.082 --> 01:05:21.717
WHETHER OR NOT TREATMENT FOSTER

01:05:21.784 --> 01:05:23.419
CARE WOULD BE A VIABLE.

01:05:23.486 --> 01:05:27.089
APPROACH -- TO TO SERVE SOME

01:05:27.156 --> 01:05:30.126
CHILDREN WHO SEE SEE OUR SAYS

01:05:30.192 --> 01:05:31.560
GET OUT OF THE GROUP HOPES.

01:05:31.627 --> 01:05:34.797
BOMB AND I THINK WE NEED TO WORK

01:05:34.864 --> 01:05:36.532
ON EITHER DEVELOPING TREATMENT

01:05:36.599 --> 01:05:38.734
FOSTER CARE WITH INTENTIONALITY

01:05:38.801 --> 01:05:40.369
OR COMING UP WITH A CONTINGENCY

01:05:40.436 --> 01:05:41.871
PLAN IF IT TURNS OUT THE

01:05:41.937 --> 01:05:42.972
TREATMENT FOSTER CARE TO IT.

01:05:43.039 --> 01:05:45.808
IT IS PERHAPS NOT VIABLE IN THE

01:05:45.875 --> 01:05:47.376
WAY THAT THAT KATIE A COURT --

01:05:47.443 --> 01:05:50.579
THOUGHT IT WAS -- THE LAST AND

01:05:50.646 --> 01:05:53.082
LAST THING I WOULD SAY IS THAT --

01:05:53.149 --> 01:05:55.384
THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS IT'S

01:05:55.451 --> 01:05:56.686
TAKEN MORE TIME.

01:05:56.752 --> 01:05:59.221
THAN PERHAPS SOME ORIGINALLY

01:05:59.288 --> 01:06:01.223
IMAGINED I SHOULD SAY PROBABLY

01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:03.292
NOT MORE TIME THAN MY MEMBERS

01:06:03.359 --> 01:06:05.428
IMAGINE -- BUT WE WERE

01:06:05.494 --> 01:06:08.464
INCREDIBLY AUDACIOUS IN SCOPE AN

01:06:08.531 --> 01:06:10.066
AMBITIOUS AND TIME FRAME.

01:06:10.132 --> 01:06:12.234
AND SO WE'LL TALK LATER ON IN

01:06:12.301 --> 01:06:13.636
THE PROPOSALS FOR INVESTMENT BUT

01:06:13.703 --> 01:06:15.137
OUR MEMBERS EXTREMELY ORRIED

01:06:15.204 --> 01:06:16.806
ABOUT PULLING OUT THE RUG.

01:06:16.872 --> 01:06:18.474
PULLING THE RUG OUT FROM UNDER

01:06:18.541 --> 01:06:20.576
THOSE UP FROM UP FROM UP FRONT

01:06:20.643 --> 01:06:23.479
INVESTMENTS LIKE RFA AND THE

01:06:23.546 --> 01:06:26.782
FAMILY STABILITY FUND BECAUSE

01:06:26.849 --> 01:06:28.084
THE FAMILY.

01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:30.519
ARE THE ALTERNATIVE -- TO

01:06:30.586 --> 01:06:31.120
GROUPON PLACEMENTS AND WE ALL

01:06:31.187 --> 01:06:32.521
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE DON'T HAVE

01:06:32.588 --> 01:06:35.925
ENOUGH OF THEM AND IT'S REALLY

01:06:35.991 --> 01:06:36.525
IMPORTANT THAT I THINK THAT WE

01:06:36.592 --> 01:06:37.093
NOT.

01:06:37.159 --> 01:06:39.495
BECAUSE OF AN UNREALISTIC TIME

01:06:39.562 --> 01:06:41.097
FRAME THAT WE SET OUT AT THE

01:06:41.163 --> 01:06:42.765
BEGINNING BECAUSE WE WERE REALLY

01:06:42.832 --> 01:06:43.966
AUDACIOUS AN AMBITIOUS.

01:06:44.033 --> 01:06:45.634
THAT WE NOT PULLED THE RUG OUT

01:06:45.701 --> 01:06:46.202
FROM UNDER THE REFORM IN MID

01:06:46.268 --> 01:06:52.007
STREAM.

01:06:52.074 --> 01:06:54.577
WE'RE GOING TO BE SHARING THE

01:06:54.643 --> 01:06:58.247
CHAIR SHIP -- WE BOTH HAVE BILLS

01:06:58.314 --> 01:06:59.181
WE'RE PRESENTING.

01:06:59.248 --> 01:07:01.550
SO WE SINCERELY APPRECIATE YOUR

01:07:01.617 --> 01:07:07.022
UNDERSTANDING IN THAT REGARD --

01:07:07.089 --> 01:07:07.957
ALL RIGHT.

01:07:08.023 --> 01:07:09.492
BEFORE THE FIFTY ABSOLUTELY YEAH

01:07:09.558 --> 01:07:11.594
SO SO BEFORE WE CONTINUE OUT WE

01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:13.229
TALKED ABOUT THE NINE HOT.

01:07:13.295 --> 01:07:15.431
NINE HUNDRED OF FACILITIES IN

01:07:15.498 --> 01:07:16.232
NINETEEN HAVE PASSED ALL THREE

01:07:16.298 --> 01:07:18.401
STEPS SOUL CAN YOU ELABORATE

01:07:18.467 --> 01:07:19.802
JUST A LITTLE BIT NOT TOO MUCH

01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:21.337
BUT I JUST WANT TO KNOW.

01:07:21.404 --> 01:07:22.571
IF THERE'S ONLY NINETEEN PASS

01:07:22.638 --> 01:07:24.607
DOES THAT MEAN THAT SOME KIDS

01:07:24.673 --> 01:07:26.208
ARE CURRENTLY IN THOSE

01:07:26.275 --> 01:07:26.876
FACILITIES.

01:07:26.942 --> 01:07:29.612
AND IF THERE IS ONLY NINETEEN

01:07:29.678 --> 01:07:30.746
AND HAVING FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES.

01:07:30.813 --> 01:07:33.849
WHAT WHAT HAPPENS TO THE?

PROGRAMS BUT DON'T YET HAVE A

01:09:59.228 --> 01:10:01.096
MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM SO THEY'RE

THAT ARE IN SOME OF THAT --

01:10:27.823 --> 01:10:28.824
BECAUSE THE CURRENT CONGREGATE

01:10:28.891 --> 01:10:30.759
CARE FACILITIES THAT MAKE THAT

01:10:30.826 --> 01:10:31.727

FAMILIES ARE ALL OF THAT CAN

01:10:45.874 --> 01:10:49.178
CARE FOR THEM IF IN JUST I AGREE

01:10:49.244 --> 01:10:54.416

01:11:01.290 --> 01:11:02.758
DECISION RIGHT TO CONTINUE IN

01:11:02.825 --> 01:11:04.893
THE LIMBO PERIOD OR DECIDE THIS

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:07.863

BE AN S. T. R. T. P..

01:11:15.938 --> 01:11:17.640
IT'S IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT THEY

NOT BECOME PART OF THE THE S. T.

01:11:19.742 --> 01:11:21.844

THEY'RE CARING FOR AND SOME OF

01:11:37.693 --> 01:11:39.995

01:11:40.062 --> 01:11:41.096
SOME POINT.

01:11:41.163 --> 01:11:42.564
THEY HAVE TO DECIDE ARE WE GONNA

01:11:42.631 --> 01:11:44.933
CONTINUE IN THIS IT TO TO TRY TO

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.035
DELIVER THE SERVICE ON BEHALF OF

EXCUSE ME THAT IT WAS TAKING.

01:12:32.514 --> 01:12:35.984
APPROPRIATE STEPS TO TRY -- TO

01:12:40.089 --> 01:12:40.289
APPROVED.

01:12:40.355 --> 01:12:41.190
THE QUESTION THAT THAT OUR

01:12:41.256 --> 01:12:43.659
MEMBERS BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE TO

01:12:43.726 --> 01:12:44.960
ANSWER WITH YOU AND WITH THE

01:12:45.027 --> 01:12:46.929
ADMINISTRATION BEFORE THIS

01:12:46.995 --> 01:12:49.565
BUDGET AND IS DO WE THINK

01:12:49.631 --> 01:12:51.333
DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST OF

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:52.301
NINETEEN CONTINUES TO BE A

01:12:52.367 --> 01:12:53.302
REASONABLE DATE.

01:12:53.368 --> 01:12:55.270
AND I BELIEVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS

01:12:55.337 --> 01:12:58.874
WILL START PROBABLY TOMORROW

01:12:58.941 --> 01:13:02.911
MORNING AROUND EIGHT O'CLOCK.

01:13:02.978 --> 01:13:04.813
CLEARLY THAT WOULD BE THE NEXT

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:08.283
BEST A PARTY BUT NUMBER SAID SHE

01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:10.586
IS A BAR IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE

01:13:10.652 --> 01:13:11.553
THAT IT'S GOING TO BED THAT.

01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:12.521
ALL THE FACILITIES THAT THAT WE

01:13:12.588 --> 01:13:14.123
WANT BECAUSE THEY DELIVER GOOD

01:13:14.189 --> 01:13:15.891
CARE AND THEY CAN REALLY -- NEED

01:13:15.958 --> 01:13:17.960
A CHILD'S NEEDS TO HEAL -- IT'S

01:13:18.026 --> 01:13:20.028
HARD TO IMAGINE THAT ALL OF THEM

01:13:20.095 --> 01:13:23.065
WILL WILL GET PAST THE FINISH

01:13:23.132 --> 01:13:24.566
LINE BY DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST.

01:13:24.633 --> 01:13:25.400
SO IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S NOT GOING

01:13:25.467 --> 01:13:28.070
TO BE REASONABLE TO EXPECT IT TO

01:13:28.137 --> 01:13:29.438
HAPPEN BY DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST.

01:13:29.505 --> 01:13:31.039
IT IS IT YOUR INTENTION THAN TO

01:13:31.106 --> 01:13:33.375
ASK FOR AN EXTENSION. TO ANY TO

01:13:33.442 --> 01:13:36.545
BEGIN THAT PROCESS.

01:13:36.612 --> 01:13:37.679
THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WERE ABOUT

01:13:37.746 --> 01:13:38.914
TO HAVE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION

01:13:38.981 --> 01:13:41.550
IS TO SORT OF IDENTIFY WHETHER

01:13:41.617 --> 01:13:42.918
OR NOT WE HAVE A SORT OF A

01:13:42.985 --> 01:13:44.920
COMMON ASSESSMENT OF THE

01:13:44.987 --> 01:13:47.322
LIKELIHOOD OF DECEMBER THIRTY

01:13:47.389 --> 01:13:48.257
FIRST BEING REASONABLE OR NOT

01:13:48.323 --> 01:13:50.659
AND AND IF IT TURNS OUT THAT MY

01:13:50.726 --> 01:13:52.961
SUPPOSITION HERE TODAY -- IS

01:13:53.028 --> 01:13:54.463
BORNE OUT IN THE ADMINISTRATION

01:13:54.530 --> 01:13:56.331
CAN KERR'S WE WOULD NEED A

01:13:56.398 --> 01:14:00.035
STATUTORY CHANGE TO ALLOW -- FOR

01:14:00.102 --> 01:14:01.737
EXCEPTIONS AND I ASSUME THE

01:14:01.804 --> 01:14:03.672
ADMINISTRATION WOULD WOULD WANT

01:14:03.739 --> 01:14:05.674
TO SIMILARLY.

01:14:05.741 --> 01:14:08.610
ENSURE THAT -- ANNEKE.

01:14:08.677 --> 01:14:09.878
IN THOSE CASES WERE EXTENSIONS

01:14:09.945 --> 01:14:12.881
OCCUR DUE DILIGENCE AS BEING

01:14:12.948 --> 01:14:13.715
MATT.

01:14:13.782 --> 01:14:15.951
AND TERMS OF FINDING FAMILIES

01:14:16.018 --> 01:14:18.353
AND AND BECAUSE IT'S NO ONE'S

01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:20.923
INTENT. TO HAVE AN INDEFINITE

01:20:59.754 --> 01:21:00.789
FOR ALL OF US WHICH WAS

01:21:00.855 --> 01:21:02.224
INDICATED BY MAINTAINING THE

01:21:02.290 --> 01:21:03.925
ORIGINAL INVESTMENT THAN.

01:21:03.992 --> 01:21:05.393
THAT THE ORIGINAL INVESTMENT

01:21:05.460 --> 01:21:07.028
INDICATED TO ME THAT THERE WAS A

01:21:07.095 --> 01:21:08.697
PRIORITY FROM THE ADMINISTRATION

01:21:08.763 --> 01:21:10.498
I I I KNOW WE'RE GONNA BE GOING

01:21:10.565 --> 01:21:11.399
BACK AND FORTH BUT THE POINT

01:21:11.466 --> 01:21:12.467
BEING.

01:21:12.534 --> 01:21:14.236
THAT YOU'RE PUTTING IT BACK ON

01:21:14.302 --> 01:21:16.605
US I WHICH I CAN APPRECIATE

01:21:16.671 --> 01:21:20.408
HOWEVER THE THE THE ORIGINAL

01:21:20.475 --> 01:21:21.776
INVESTMENT INDICATED THAT THERE

01:21:21.843 --> 01:21:22.844
WERE SOME WILLINGNESS FROM THAT

01:21:22.911 --> 01:21:25.013
THE ADMINISTRATION TO CONTINUE

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:26.248
WITH THIS.

01:21:26.314 --> 01:21:34.956
CELL. EIGHT I DON'T SEE THE I'M.

01:21:35.023 --> 01:21:35.624
THE INTENT.

01:21:35.690 --> 01:21:36.758
I GUESS FROM THE ADMINISTRATION

01:21:36.825 --> 01:21:37.325
TO CONTINUE YOUR YOU KEEP

01:21:37.392 --> 01:21:38.793
INDICATING THAT IF THERE'S AN

01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:40.528
INTENT FROM THE LEGISLATURE.

01:21:40.595 --> 01:21:42.597
THAN THAN -- THAN THE

01:21:42.664 --> 01:21:43.798
ADMINISTRATION WILL COMPLY BUT

01:21:43.865 --> 01:21:45.567
THE NICHOLS CAUGHT UP BACK TO

01:21:45.634 --> 01:21:47.202
WHAT YOU ORIGINALLY SAID THAT.

01:21:47.269 --> 01:21:48.370
THEY WERE MAINTAINING THE

01:21:48.436 --> 01:21:50.105
ORIGINAL INVESTMENT THE IN IT

01:21:50.171 --> 01:21:51.906
JUST THERE THERE'S NO INTENT

01:21:51.973 --> 01:21:53.742
ISN'T WHAT MY QUESTION IS ARE MY

01:21:53.808 --> 01:21:55.310
POINT IS.

01:21:55.377 --> 01:21:59.648
BY THE NINE INVESTMENT THIS TIME.

01:21:59.714 --> 01:22:05.854
AND MADAME CHAIRS -- THE FROM

01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:06.855
THIS FROM THIS THAT FROM THE

01:22:06.921 --> 01:22:07.489
STANDPOINT OF THE COUNTIES THAT

01:22:07.555 --> 01:22:08.723
ARE THAT ARE IMPLEMENTING THIS

01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:09.991
REFORM ON YOUR BEHALF WE ASSUMED

01:22:10.058 --> 01:22:10.925
A LOT OF THINGS THREE YEARS AGO.

01:22:10.992 --> 01:22:13.194
SO IT MAY BE TRUE THAT THREE

01:22:13.261 --> 01:22:16.064
YEARS AGO WE ASSUMED THAT WE

01:22:16.131 --> 01:22:16.665
WOULD HAVE ALL THE FAMILIES WE

01:22:16.731 --> 01:22:19.067
NEEDED -- WE ASSUMED THAT ALL

01:22:19.134 --> 01:22:20.302
THE S. T. R. T. PIECE WOULD HAVE

01:22:20.368 --> 01:22:21.736
CONVERTED.

01:22:21.803 --> 01:22:23.638
THE KD ES COURT ASSUME WE HAVE

01:22:23.705 --> 01:22:25.307
TREATMENT FOSTER CARE WE ASSUMED

01:22:25.373 --> 01:22:27.208
A LOT OF THINGS SOME OF THEM

01:22:27.275 --> 01:22:29.311
HAPPENED AND SOME OF THEM DID

01:22:29.377 --> 01:22:30.979
NOT AND SO.

01:22:31.046 --> 01:22:33.315
IT SEEMS I WOULD ASK THE

01:22:33.381 --> 01:22:35.216
ADMINISTRATION THAT INHERITED CC

01:22:35.283 --> 01:22:35.650
ARE FROM THE PRIOR%

01:22:35.717 --> 01:22:37.719
ADMINISTRATION TO UNDERSTAND

01:22:37.786 --> 01:22:40.855
THAT -- WE'RE ALL IN GOOD FAITH

01:22:40.922 --> 01:22:42.590
MAKING MID COURSE CORRECTIONS

01:22:42.657 --> 01:22:43.625
AND WORKING AS HARD AS WE

01:22:43.692 --> 01:22:45.794
POSSIBLY CAN TO IMPLEMENT THIS

01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:48.296
REFORM SOME THINGS ARE GOING AS

01:22:48.363 --> 01:22:49.698
PLANNED AND SOME THINGS AREN'T.

01:22:49.764 --> 01:22:51.499
SO TO SAY WELL THREE YEARS AGO

01:22:51.566 --> 01:22:52.634
WE THOUGHT IT WAS ALL GOING TO

01:22:52.701 --> 01:22:54.035
BE DONE AND IT'S NOT SO IF YOU

01:22:54.102 --> 01:22:55.203
WANT TO DO IT AFTER THREE YEARS

01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:56.638
IT'S ON YOU BUT THAT'S NOT OUR

01:22:56.705 --> 01:22:57.806
PRIORITY.

01:22:57.872 --> 01:22:59.007
I DON'T THINK THAT THAT IS AN

01:22:59.074 --> 01:23:00.809
APPROPRIATE WAY TO VIEW OUR

01:23:00.875 --> 01:23:02.344
RESPONSIBILITY TO IMPLEMENT

01:23:02.410 --> 01:23:04.279
CURRENT LAW BECAUSE CCAR'S

01:23:04.346 --> 01:23:05.814
CURRENT LAW.

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:07.649
AND IF WE'RE ALL TOGETHER MAKING

01:23:07.716 --> 01:23:09.718
A GOOD FAITH MID COURSE

01:23:09.784 --> 01:23:11.586
CORRECTIONS AND ASSESSMENT OF

01:23:11.653 --> 01:23:13.021
HOW WELL WE'RE DOING.

01:23:13.088 --> 01:23:14.222
THEN WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE

01:23:14.289 --> 01:23:15.957
THOSE SAME ADJUSTMENTS ON THE

01:23:16.024 --> 01:23:17.625
FINANCING SIDE.

01:23:17.692 --> 01:23:19.227
I THINK THAT THE THE BOTTOM LINE

01:23:19.294 --> 01:23:20.395
IS.

01:23:20.462 --> 01:23:22.530
ARE THESE REDUCTIONS GOING TO

01:23:22.597 --> 01:23:25.200
HELP OR HURT C. C. R..

01:23:25.266 --> 01:23:26.201
AND I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE

01:23:26.267 --> 01:23:28.336
THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WILL

01:23:28.403 --> 01:23:29.804
HURT IT I MEAN I ASSUME WE CAN

01:23:29.871 --> 01:23:31.106
ALL AGREE THAT THE REDUCTIONS

01:23:31.172 --> 01:23:32.273
WILL HURT IT.

01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:33.742
I THINK THAT THE THE IF WE TALK

01:23:33.808 --> 01:23:35.977
ABOUT PRIORITIES IT ISN'T

01:23:36.044 --> 01:23:37.679
LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY ONLY I

01:23:37.746 --> 01:23:38.713
THINK IT HAS TO BE A MUTUAL

01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:39.948
PRIORITY.

01:23:40.014 --> 01:23:41.416
AND I THINK IF WE VIEW IT THAT

01:23:41.483 --> 01:23:44.552
WAY JUST AS YOU SAID WE'RE ALL

01:23:44.619 --> 01:23:45.987
IN THIS TOGETHER.

01:23:46.054 --> 01:23:47.956
ARE WE WE WE END.

01:23:48.022 --> 01:23:49.791
WE HAVE TO AT TIMES TAKE A

01:23:49.858 --> 01:23:51.292
REFRESHED LOOK.

01:23:51.359 --> 01:23:53.128
AT ANY VALUATION AS OPPOSED TO

01:23:53.194 --> 01:23:55.063
SAYING THIS IS WHAT WE DECIDED

01:23:55.130 --> 01:23:56.131
ON AND THAT'S IT.

01:23:56.197 --> 01:23:58.333
EVERY YEAR I THINK WE NEED TO

01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:00.769
LOOK AT THIS AGAIN AND YOU'RE

01:24:00.835 --> 01:24:02.203
RIGHT WE'RE ALL TRYING TO DO.

01:24:02.270 --> 01:24:03.772
THE ABSOLUTE BEST THAT WE CAN

01:24:03.838 --> 01:24:05.640
WILL HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF

01:24:05.707 --> 01:24:07.075
RESPONSIBILITY DIFFERENT LEVELS

01:24:07.142 --> 01:24:09.911
OF EXPERTISE TO BE ABLE TO OFFER

01:24:09.978 --> 01:24:11.746
MORE TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT WE

01:24:11.813 --> 01:24:12.881
DO IN THE END.

01:24:12.947 --> 01:24:16.618
WILL HELP US TAKE CARE OF THAT

01:24:16.684 --> 01:24:17.886
SUIT THE C. C. R..

01:24:17.952 --> 01:24:19.854
IT HELPS TO TO REACH THE THE THE

01:24:19.921 --> 01:24:22.424
GOALS THAT WE WANT FROM THE C.

01:24:22.490 --> 01:24:24.159

I THINK MAYBE THE IF I MAY THE

01:36:06.627 --> 01:36:07.595
ONLY OTHER THING THAT I WOULD

01:36:07.661 --> 01:36:09.830
ADD TO THIS IS THAT -- AS WE'VE

01:36:09.897 --> 01:36:11.332
SEEN WITH OTHER INVESTMENTS LIKE

01:36:11.398 --> 01:36:14.034
THE RFA BACKLOG REDUCTION.

01:36:14.101 --> 01:36:15.503
WHEN WE PUT MONEY INTO SOMETHING

01:36:15.569 --> 01:36:17.037
BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

01:36:17.104 --> 01:36:18.139
WE SHOULD ALSO BE CLEAR ABOUT

01:36:18.205 --> 01:36:19.773
WHAT WE EXPECT TO GET OUT OF

01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:21.041
THAT INVESTMENT OR WHAT THE

PROGRESS OR MILESTONES ARE THAT

01:36:22.810 --> 01:36:24.044
WE'RE EXPECTING AND SO I WOULD

01:36:24.111 --> 01:36:24.912
JUST ADD THAT TO THE

01:36:24.979 --> 01:36:26.380
CONVERSATION?

01:36:26.447 --> 01:36:28.415

FOUNDER AND CEO OF SENECA FAMILY

01:41:17.571 --> 01:41:21.308
OF AGENCIES WHERE ONE OF THOSE

NINETEEN STI TEEPEES IN THE

01:41:21.942 --> 01:41:22.109
STATE.

01:41:22.176 --> 01:41:23.444
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WERE ONE OF

01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:24.711
THE LARGEST WRAPAROUND PROVIDERS

01:41:24.778 --> 01:41:25.779
IN THE STATE.

01:41:25.846 --> 01:41:27.347
AND WE PROVIDE SERVICES ACROSS

01:41:27.414 --> 01:41:29.049
CHILD WELFARE MENTAL HEALTH

01:41:29.116 --> 01:41:31.418
JUVENILE JUSTICE AND EDUCATION

01:41:31.485 --> 01:41:33.687
IN INTEGRATED SYSTEMS. TO THAT

01:41:33.754 --> 01:41:35.522
END AND BECAUSE OF THAT WORK

01:41:35.589 --> 01:41:37.891
WE'VE SEEN UP CLOSE.

01:41:37.958 --> 01:41:40.260
THE IMPACTS OF SOME OF THE GAPS

01:41:40.327 --> 01:41:41.929
IN OUR SERVICE SYSTEM FOR KIDS

01:41:41.995 --> 01:41:42.896
AND FAMILIES.

01:41:42.963 --> 01:41:44.798
AND SEEING THOSE GAPS THREE

01:41:44.865 --> 01:41:46.200
YEARS AGO WE GOT A GRANT FROM

01:41:46.266 --> 01:41:47.701
THE IRVINE FOUNDATION. TO BRING

01:41:47.768 --> 01:41:50.804
LEADERS IN THE STATE TOGETHER TO

01:41:50.871 --> 01:41:52.506
LOOK AT HI NEEDS YOU.

01:41:52.573 --> 01:41:53.440
AND THE SAY ONE OF THE THINGS

01:41:53.507 --> 01:41:56.810
THAT COULD BE MOST IMPACTFUL FOR

01:41:56.877 --> 01:41:57.811
THOSE WHO.

01:41:57.878 --> 01:41:59.112
AND AND THROUGH THAT PROCESS

01:41:59.179 --> 01:42:00.981
WHAT WE SAW IS THAT YOUTH ARE

01:42:01.048 --> 01:42:02.216
ENDING UP.

01:42:02.282 --> 01:42:03.984
IN HOSPITALS.

01:42:04.051 --> 01:42:05.619
IN JUVENILE HALLS.

01:42:05.686 --> 01:42:07.187
AND HOMELESS.

01:42:07.254 --> 01:42:08.722
THAT NEVER NEEDED TO BE.

01:42:08.789 --> 01:42:09.756
AND THEY DIDN'T NEED TO BE

01:42:09.823 --> 01:42:11.091
BECAUSE THERE ARE MOMENTS IN

01:42:11.158 --> 01:42:12.693
THOSE WHOSE LIFE AND THEIR

01:42:12.759 --> 01:42:13.894
FAMILIES LIVE.

01:42:13.961 --> 01:42:15.596
WHERE WE CAN OPTIONALLY

01:42:15.662 --> 01:42:17.664
INTERVENE USING A MOBILE CRISIS

01:42:17.731 --> 01:42:20.133
RESPONSE SYSTEM THAT CAN CHANGE

01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:21.235
THEIR TRAJECTORY?

01:42:21.301 --> 01:42:23.470
THE TRUTH IS I DON'T THINK WE

01:42:23.537 --> 01:42:25.239
KNOW HOW MANY S. T. R. T. P.

01:42:25.305 --> 01:42:26.106
BETS WE NEED IN THE STATE.

01:42:26.173 --> 01:42:27.341
I DON'T THINK WE KNOW HOW MANY

01:42:27.407 --> 01:42:29.476
FOSTER VETS WE NEED IN THE STATE

01:42:29.543 --> 01:42:30.477
BECAUSE UNTIL WE BUILD THAT ARE

01:42:30.544 --> 01:42:32.579
OUR SYSTEM OF FOSTER CARE WE

01:42:32.646 --> 01:42:33.647
DON'T KNOW HOW MANY US T. I. T.

01:42:33.714 --> 01:42:35.182
PEOPLE AT TWENTY EIGHT AND UNTIL

01:42:35.249 --> 01:42:36.016
WE BUILD OUTS THAT THINGS LIKE

01:42:36.083 --> 01:42:37.551
MOBILE RESPONSE.

01:42:37.618 --> 01:42:39.219
THAT DIVERT KIDS AN OPPORTUNITY

01:42:39.286 --> 01:42:42.256
MOMENTS INTO AWAY FROM PLACES

01:42:42.322 --> 01:42:44.124
LIKE HOSPITALS AND GROUP CARE

01:42:44.191 --> 01:42:46.226
AND INTO MORE -- SUPPORTED HOME

01:42:46.293 --> 01:42:47.861
BASED SERVICES THEN WE'LL KNOW

01:42:47.928 --> 01:42:52.699
WHAT WE NEED FOR HIGHER AND

01:42:52.766 --> 01:42:53.233
SERVICE.

01:42:53.300 --> 01:42:53.934
WE'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF

01:42:54.001 --> 01:42:54.835
RUNNING FOR CONTRA COSTA AND SAN

01:42:54.902 --> 01:42:56.503
FRANCISCO MOBILE RESPONSE TEAMS.

01:42:56.570 --> 01:42:57.137
AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN I STARTED I

01:42:57.204 --> 01:42:58.639
HAD WRITTEN DOWN HERE OF THAT

01:42:58.705 --> 01:43:01.341
WE'VE SEEN IN 80% DIVERSION RATE

01:43:01.408 --> 01:43:03.277
BUT OUR CLINICAL DIRECTOR IS

01:43:03.343 --> 01:43:05.045
HERE TODAY AND SHE REMINDED ME

01:43:05.112 --> 01:43:07.714
THAT WAS EIGHTY THREE POINT

01:43:07.781 --> 01:43:10.617
SOMETHING PERCENT.

01:43:10.684 --> 01:43:11.552
YOU CAN'T FORGET THE DECIMAL

01:43:11.618 --> 01:43:12.052
POINT.

01:43:12.119 --> 01:43:14.588
THE BOTTOM LINE IS MORE THAN

01:43:14.655 --> 01:43:16.056
EIGHT OUT OF TEN KIDS DON'T END

01:43:16.123 --> 01:43:19.092
UP IN A HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM

01:43:19.159 --> 01:43:20.527
GOING TO PEOPLE WHO ARE SICK.

01:43:20.594 --> 01:43:21.929
THEY DON'T END UP IN JUVENILE

01:43:21.995 --> 01:43:23.764
HALL AND THEY DON'T USE A LOCAL

01:43:23.830 --> 01:43:25.666
POLICE OFFICER AS THEIR CRISIS

01:43:25.732 --> 01:43:27.000
COUNSELOR.

01:43:27.067 --> 01:43:28.769
AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IN OUR

01:43:28.835 --> 01:43:30.037
CURRENT SYSTEM A YOUTH IS IN

01:43:30.103 --> 01:43:32.205
CRISIS THE PARENT DOESN'T KNOW

01:43:32.272 --> 01:43:34.341
WHO OR WHAT WHO TO CALL OR HOW

01:43:34.408 --> 01:43:35.108
TO GET HELP.

01:43:35.175 --> 01:43:36.510
IN THE END UP COMING INTO A

01:43:36.577 --> 01:43:38.278
SYSTEM THAT WAS NEVER DESIGNED

01:43:38.345 --> 01:43:39.746
TO MEET THEIR NEEDS AND TO KEEP

01:43:39.813 --> 01:43:41.515
THEM OUT OF HIGHER AND SYSTEMS

01:43:41.582 --> 01:43:42.849
AND PROVIDE SUPPORT.

01:43:42.916 --> 01:43:45.118
WE'VE DONE SO MUCH IN THE STATE

01:43:45.185 --> 01:43:46.787
BY PROVIDING WRAPAROUND SERVICES

01:43:46.853 --> 01:43:48.789
ACROSS THE STATE BY CREATING

01:43:48.855 --> 01:43:51.024
SYSTEMS TO INTERVENE AND SCHOOLS

01:43:51.091 --> 01:43:52.993
BY CREATING SYSTEMS THAT CAN

01:43:53.060 --> 01:43:54.094
INTERVENE EARLIER.

01:43:54.161 --> 01:43:55.662
THROUGH THE PROCESS OF THE OF

01:43:55.729 --> 01:43:57.331
THE IRVINE GRANT AND TALKING

01:43:57.397 --> 01:43:58.565
WITH LEADERS AROUND THE STATE

01:43:58.632 --> 01:43:59.333
ABOUT WHAT WE COULD DO

01:43:59.399 --> 01:44:01.101
DIFFERENTLY I BELIEVE THERE IS

01:44:01.168 --> 01:44:02.669
NOTHING WE CAN DO.

01:44:02.736 --> 01:44:04.938
THAT WOULD BE MORE IMPORTANT AND

01:44:05.005 --> 01:44:06.573
MORE IMPACTFUL THAN TO PROVIDE

01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:08.508
STATEWIDE URGENT RESPONSE SYSTEM

01:44:08.575 --> 01:44:10.344

01:44:13.780 --> 01:44:17.317
KNOWS WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT.

01:44:17.384 --> 01:44:18.986
WE CALLED JOHANNA I THINK WE

01:44:19.052 --> 01:44:32.866

01:44:48.081 --> 01:44:50.617
DOMINANCE HOW MY PROGRAM.

01:44:50.684 --> 01:44:51.752
SO WE'VE BEEN RUNNING OUR

01:44:51.818 --> 01:44:53.120
PROGRAMS ARE IT WOULD YOU GAVE

01:44:53.186 --> 01:44:54.321
YOU MADE IT FOR THE HARSH AS I

01:44:54.388 --> 01:44:55.922
THOUGHT ARE COMING UP FOR ONE

01:44:55.989 --> 01:44:57.591
MINUTE TO TELL US NUMBER.

01:44:57.658 --> 01:44:58.392
SO WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN RUNNING A

01:44:58.458 --> 01:44:59.860
PROGRAM FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS IN

01:44:59.926 --> 01:45:00.794
OUR COUNTY -- WHICH IS REALLY

01:45:00.861 --> 01:45:02.029
SIGNIFICANT A REALLY LONG TIME

01:45:02.095 --> 01:45:03.296
TO BE RUNNING A PROGRAM HALF OF

01:45:03.363 --> 01:45:03.964
OUR STAFF HAS BEEN WORKING WITH

01:45:04.031 --> 01:45:04.564
US FOR MORE THAN FIVE YEARS

01:45:04.631 --> 01:45:05.999
WHICH IS WHILE CONSIDERING THAT

01:45:06.066 --> 01:45:06.933
IT'S MENTAL HEALTH IT'S

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:08.769
COMMUNITY BASED AND IT'S CRISIS

01:45:08.835 --> 01:45:10.537
WORK -- I THINK THE BEAUTY OF

01:45:10.604 --> 01:45:11.905
OUR PROGRAM IS THAT WE'RE JUST

01:45:11.972 --> 01:45:13.273
REALLY ABLE TO SERVE.

01:45:13.340 --> 01:45:14.574
FAMILIES AT A TIME THAT'S

01:45:14.641 --> 01:45:16.343
CONVENIENT FOR THEM AT THEIR

01:45:16.410 --> 01:45:18.278
HOME ADD IN A SPACE THAT'S

01:45:18.345 --> 01:45:19.513
COMING UP FOR THEM IN THEIR

01:45:19.579 --> 01:45:21.548
LANGUAGE -- IT'S REALLY MENTAL

01:45:21.615 --> 01:45:22.716
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS RESPONDING

01:45:22.783 --> 01:45:24.418
MENTAL HEALTH CRISES -- REALLY

01:45:24.484 --> 01:45:25.686
THERE TO ADVOCATE FOR THEM AND

01:45:25.752 --> 01:45:26.787
REALLY SUPPORT THEM THROUGHOUT

01:45:26.853 --> 01:45:28.388
THAT ENTIRE PROCESS WHAT WE DO

01:45:28.455 --> 01:45:30.524
HAVE A GREAT DIVERSION RATE IT

01:45:30.590 --> 01:45:32.492
WE DON'T ALWAYS GET TO DIVERT

01:45:32.559 --> 01:45:34.161
BUT WE DO GET TO HELP -- CHANCE

01:45:34.227 --> 01:45:34.928
FOR THEM TO THE HOSPITAL BE WITH

01:45:34.995 --> 01:45:36.329
THEM THROUGHOUT THAT PROCESS AND

01:45:36.396 --> 01:45:38.732
REALLY SUPPORT THEM AND PROVIDE

01:45:38.799 --> 01:45:40.000
FOLLOW UP SERVICES IF THEY NEED

01:45:40.067 --> 01:45:41.902
ANY -- SO THE CONFLICT OVERVIEW

01:45:41.968 --> 01:45:45.739
OF WHAT WE DO -- HAPPY AND IF IF

01:45:45.806 --> 01:45:47.307
I COULD JUST ADD TO THAT TIME

01:45:47.374 --> 01:45:48.308
AND TIME AGAIN.

01:45:48.375 --> 01:45:50.210
WE IN MOST OF OUR COUNTY STACK

01:45:50.277 --> 01:45:52.145
PROVIDES PROGRAMS ACROSS THE

01:45:52.212 --> 01:45:52.379
STATE.

01:45:52.446 --> 01:45:54.147
AND MOST OF OUR CAN AS WE DON'T

01:45:54.214 --> 01:45:54.715
HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF HAVING

01:45:54.781 --> 01:45:55.248
LEVEL RESPONSE.

01:45:55.315 --> 01:45:56.383
AND SO WHAT WE SEE IS A CYCLE

01:45:56.450 --> 01:45:59.119
WHETHER WHERE EITHER POLICE OR

01:45:59.186 --> 01:45:59.686
SOMETIMES MENTAL HEALTH AND

01:45:59.753 --> 01:46:00.287
BEING.

01:46:00.353 --> 01:46:01.054
A CHILD ENDS UP IN AN EMERGENCY

01:46:01.121 --> 01:46:02.522
ROOM IN THE HOSPITAL USUALLY

01:46:02.589 --> 01:46:04.057
THOSE WAIT TIMES WHEN SOMEBODY'S

01:46:04.124 --> 01:46:06.460
IN THE KID PSYCHIATRIC CRISIS.

01:46:06.526 --> 01:46:08.328
IS OUR FOUR SIX EIGHT AT THE

01:46:08.395 --> 01:46:10.163
I'VE HEARD NIGHTMARE STORIES OF

01:46:10.230 --> 01:46:12.766
MUCH LONGER YOU KNOW THE STORIES --

01:46:12.833 --> 01:46:14.434
OFTEN ARE TEENAGERS SIMPLY WALK

01:46:14.501 --> 01:46:15.435
OUT.

01:46:15.502 --> 01:46:23.310
THEY DON'T EVEN WAIT TO GET HELP.

01:46:23.376 --> 01:46:24.111
THAT'S BEST CASE SCENARIO.

01:46:24.177 --> 01:46:24.845
WORST CASE SCENARIOS LAW

01:46:24.911 --> 01:46:26.213
ENFORCEMENT IS CALLED.

01:46:26.279 --> 01:46:27.581
THE SOMETHING HAPPENS THAT TAKES

01:46:27.647 --> 01:46:28.915
THEM DOWN THAT TRAJECTORY AND

01:46:28.982 --> 01:46:30.217
THEY'RE IN JUVENILE HALL AND

01:46:30.283 --> 01:46:31.451
THEN IN RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT OR

01:46:31.518 --> 01:46:32.652
IN A GROUP HOME.

01:46:32.719 --> 01:46:34.254
OF AT AND AND SO MANY OF THOSE

01:46:34.321 --> 01:46:36.990
SITUATIONS ARE UNNECESSARY.

01:46:37.057 --> 01:46:38.792
SO MANY OF THE SITUATIONS WHEN

01:46:38.859 --> 01:46:39.993
WE GET TENER BEING AT THE

01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:41.394
OPTIMAL POINT.

01:46:41.461 --> 01:46:43.363
CAN PROVIDE THE PIVOT POINT THAT

01:46:43.430 --> 01:46:46.032
ALLOWS US TO KEEP KIDS AT HOME

01:46:46.099 --> 01:46:48.668
OR IN A FOSTER HOME.

01:46:48.735 --> 01:46:49.269
OR IN THE COMMUNITY AND IN THE

01:46:49.336 --> 01:46:53.039
COMMUNITY -- I KNOW THAT THE SO

01:46:53.106 --> 01:46:54.775
WE HAVE MANY SOCIAL WORKERS HERE

01:46:54.841 --> 01:46:56.643
AT THE CAPITOL FOR THEIR LOBBY

01:46:56.710 --> 01:46:57.444
DAY.

01:46:57.511 --> 01:47:00.847
AND THEY HAVE SHARED THE TO WHAT

01:47:00.914 --> 01:47:02.516
A NIGHTMARE FOR THEM IS TO PICK

01:47:02.582 --> 01:47:03.917
UP THE PHONE AND TO HAVE A

01:47:03.984 --> 01:47:05.485
PARENT SAY.

01:47:05.552 --> 01:47:07.988
I'VE GIVEN UP ON GIVING MY CHILD

01:47:08.054 --> 01:47:08.622
TWENTY FOUR HOURS TO GET OUT OF

01:47:08.688 --> 01:47:13.126
HERE -- THE AFTER OUR CHILDREN

01:47:13.193 --> 01:47:15.362

TO BE PLACED INTO FOSTER CARE.

01:47:20.934 --> 01:47:22.002
IT'S SO IMPORTANT BE ABLE TO

01:47:22.068 --> 01:47:24.070
MAINTAIN THAT AND I THINK THAT

01:47:24.137 --> 01:47:25.672
THIS FAMILY URGENT RESPONSE

01:47:25.739 --> 01:47:27.307
SYSTEM.

01:47:27.374 --> 01:47:31.011
IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT -- WE WE

01:47:31.077 --> 01:47:34.481
NEED TO PRESERVE THE PLACEMENT.

01:47:34.548 --> 01:47:36.583
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND NOT FOR

01:47:36.650 --> 01:47:37.984
THE TRAUMATIZED THAT FOSTER

01:47:38.051 --> 01:47:39.252
YOUTH.

01:47:39.319 --> 01:47:41.154

01:47:49.329 --> 01:47:50.096
YOUTH.

01:47:50.163 --> 01:47:51.064
THERE WAS ONE INSTANCE WHERE

01:47:51.131 --> 01:47:52.365
THEY WERE ALL HOLDING UP THEIR

01:47:52.432 --> 01:47:54.467

ALL.

01:48:01.842 --> 01:48:04.211
UNACCEPTABLE HAVING A HOTLINE

01:48:04.277 --> 01:48:06.079
HAVING DOING EVERYTHING THAT WE

01:49:36.703 --> 01:49:38.138

OURSELVES -- WE FIND THAT WE

01:49:55.922 --> 01:49:56.389
NEED TO HAVE THAT INITIAL

01:49:56.456 --> 01:49:58.525
ASSESSMENT WERE ABLE -- TO IT'S

01:49:58.591 --> 01:49:59.693
LIKE A WARM HAND OFF AND THEY'RE

01:49:59.759 --> 01:50:03.263
MORE LIKELY TO UTILIZE US DURING

01:50:03.330 --> 01:50:05.432
A CRISIS.

01:50:05.498 --> 01:50:06.900
THANK YOU WERE PLAYING MUSICAL

01:50:06.967 --> 01:50:07.267
CHAIRS.

01:50:07.334 --> 01:50:08.335
ACTUALLY THE LAST TWO WEEKS HAVE

01:50:08.401 --> 01:50:09.803
BEEN THAT WAY SO I APPRECIATE

01:50:09.869 --> 01:50:12.939
YOUR OF FLEXIBILITY HERE -- SOUL

01:50:13.006 --> 01:50:14.541
ANY REACTION OR FEEDBACK FROM

01:50:14.607 --> 01:50:16.843
THE ADMINISTRATION DEPARTMENT OF

01:50:16.910 --> 01:50:17.844
FINANCE ARE ALEJO.

01:50:17.911 --> 01:50:18.979
I'D SAY THE GREG ROSE AGAIN FOR

01:50:19.045 --> 01:50:20.180
THE DEPARTMENT CERTAINLY WERE

01:50:20.246 --> 01:50:22.749
AWARE OF THESE TYPES OF SERVICES --

01:50:22.816 --> 01:50:24.784
AND PROGRAMS AND IN OTHER STATES

01:50:24.851 --> 01:50:26.953
AND AND IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS

01:50:27.020 --> 01:50:29.055
AND I THINK THAT THE KEY FOR US

01:50:29.122 --> 01:50:30.256
IS THAT THE KEY FOR ME WHEN I

01:50:30.323 --> 01:50:31.358
THINK ABOUT IS.

01:50:31.424 --> 01:50:33.560
HOW WE GO ABOUT HOW

01:50:33.626 --> 01:50:35.662
IMPLEMENTATION AGO ABOUT IT MANY

01:50:35.729 --> 01:50:36.629
OF THE PLACES I'M AWARE IT ARE

01:50:36.696 --> 01:50:38.565
RIGHT OUR SMALL SMALLER --

01:50:38.631 --> 01:50:42.435
JURISDICTIONS AND DO WE DO HAVE.

01:50:42.502 --> 01:50:43.303
URBAN AND RURAL AND DISTANCE AND

01:50:43.370 --> 01:50:44.337
A NUMBER OF THINGS TO CONSIDER

01:50:44.404 --> 01:50:46.740
BUT WE ARE IN FACT AWARE OF OF

01:50:46.806 --> 01:50:48.408
OF THE UTILITY OF THESE KINDS OF

01:50:48.475 --> 01:50:49.642
PROGRAMS AND WE'VE SEEN THEM IN

01:50:49.709 --> 01:50:51.611
OTHER JURISDICTIONS.

01:50:51.678 --> 01:50:53.580
AND IF I MAY THE ALLEN BEATS SO

01:50:53.646 --> 01:50:55.348
WAS ONE OF THE ENGINEERS OF THE

01:50:55.415 --> 01:50:56.816
NEW JERSEY SYSTEM WHICH IS

01:50:56.883 --> 01:50:58.585
ACTUALLY A LARGER MORE SKILLED

01:50:58.651 --> 01:51:00.186
SYSTEM AND HE WORKED.

01:51:00.253 --> 01:51:02.389
WITH US ON SOME OF THE IDEAS

01:51:02.455 --> 01:51:03.323
AROUND CONSTRUCTION OF THE

01:51:03.390 --> 01:51:06.726
SYSTEM AND HOW IT CAN BE SCALED --

01:51:06.793 --> 01:51:08.595
MOBILE RESPONSE ACTUALLY.

01:51:08.661 --> 01:51:09.729
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH IS IN A

01:51:09.796 --> 01:51:11.398
MORE COST EFFECTIVE PROGRAM AT

01:51:11.464 --> 01:51:13.900
SCALE THE THE SMALLER IT IS THE

01:51:13.967 --> 01:51:15.168
MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE YOU HAVE

01:51:15.235 --> 01:51:16.102
TO HAVE AVAILABILITY.

01:51:16.169 --> 01:51:18.171
AND AN UNUSED AVAILABILITY IS

01:51:18.238 --> 01:51:19.773
REALLY EXPENSIVE.

01:51:19.839 --> 01:51:21.508
SO SO TO THE DEGREE THAT YOU CAN

01:51:21.574 --> 01:51:23.543
HAVE DEPTH IN TEAMS TO RESPOND

01:51:23.610 --> 01:51:26.379
TO A BROADER AREA YOU DO GET.

01:51:26.446 --> 01:51:27.947
NOT JUST SMALL ECONOMIES OF

01:51:28.014 --> 01:51:30.050
SCALE BUT BIG ECONOMIES OF SCALE

01:51:30.116 --> 01:51:31.618
AROUND THE INITIAL RESPONSE

01:51:31.684 --> 01:51:33.119
ESPECIALLY SO THERE ARE SOME

01:51:33.186 --> 01:51:34.487
THINGS THAT REALLY WORK ABOUT A

01:51:34.554 --> 01:51:36.056
STATEWIDE SYSTEM THAT ARE VERY

01:51:36.122 --> 01:51:39.559
DIFFICULT IN THE SMALLER SYSTEMS

01:51:39.626 --> 01:51:42.062
THAT WE'RE RUNNING.

01:51:42.128 --> 01:51:44.564
THANK YOU DEPARTMENT.

DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON ANY OF

01:51:48.034 --> 01:51:50.737
THEM AT THIS TIME -- SO AGAIN.

01:51:50.804 --> 01:51:53.039
TO THE EXTENT IT'S PRIORITY OF

01:51:53.106 --> 01:51:56.876
THE LEGISLATURE WERE HAPPY.

01:51:56.943 --> 01:52:00.313
TO ENGAGE WITH ON THE DON'T.

TALKING A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT

01:52:37.817 --> 01:52:39.219
THE FUNDING -- AS A STATE

01:52:39.285 --> 01:52:40.120
MANSION LAST YEAR THE

01:52:40.186 --> 01:52:40.987
LEGISLATURE IN THE

01:52:41.054 --> 01:52:42.622
ADMINISTRATION CAME TOGETHER HEN

01:52:42.689 --> 01:52:44.057
THEY STAND A CRISIS.

01:52:44.124 --> 01:52:45.492
AND YOUR FOR YOUR FUNNY AT THE

01:52:45.558 --> 01:52:46.860
TIME A PLACEMENT HAS JUST BEEN A

FAMILY TO ME JUST SO MANY FOLKS

01:52:51.764 --> 01:52:53.366
ON WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT

01:52:53.433 --> 01:52:54.167
HOWEVER WE'RE VERY CONCERNED

01:52:54.234 --> 01:52:54.834
ABOUT THE COMING YEAR.

01:52:54.901 --> 01:52:55.835
SO IN THE DEAL THAT WAS MADE

01:52:55.902 --> 01:52:57.937
LAST YEAR WE THOUGHT WE WOULD BE

01:52:58.004 --> 01:52:59.606
AT NINETY DAYS ISSUE NOTED THE

01:52:59.672 --> 01:53:00.673
STATE THOUGHT WE WOULD BE THERE

01:53:00.740 --> 01:53:01.708
AND SO.

01:53:01.774 --> 01:53:03.476
IN THE LEGISLATION WE NOW CUT

01:53:03.543 --> 01:53:05.745
OFF THAT FUNDING IT NINETY DAYS

01:53:05.812 --> 01:53:07.347
STARTING ON JUNE THIRTIETH.

01:53:07.413 --> 01:53:08.615
AND THERE'S ALSO NO GOOD BECAUSE

01:53:08.681 --> 01:53:10.650
EXEMPTION ANYMORE SO ALL THE

01:53:10.717 --> 01:53:12.652
PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE AND ALL

01:53:12.719 --> 01:53:13.453
THIS GOOD NEWS THAT THE STATE

01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:14.687
GAVE YOU.

01:53:14.754 --> 01:53:16.156
ALL ENDS ON JUNE THIRTIETH.

01:53:16.222 --> 01:53:17.624
SAYS ADVOCATES WERE VERY

01:53:17.690 --> 01:53:18.825
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT WE WOULD

01:53:18.892 --> 01:53:20.960
ASK THE LEGISLATURE TO REALLY

01:53:21.027 --> 01:53:22.929
WHO WORK WITH US TO CONTINUE THE

01:53:22.996 --> 01:53:24.764
AMAZING WORK THAT HAPPENED. TO

01:53:24.831 --> 01:53:26.266
MAKE SURE THAT WE EXTEND TO AT

01:53:26.332 --> 01:53:28.101
LEAST A HUNDRED AND TWENTY OR A

01:53:28.168 --> 01:53:29.068
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT EIGHTY

01:53:29.135 --> 01:53:29.402
DAYS.

01:53:29.469 --> 01:53:31.337
BECAUSE A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS IS

01:53:31.404 --> 01:53:32.305
THE CURRENT AVERAGE.

01:53:32.372 --> 01:53:33.973
SAID ANYTHING BELOW THAT REALLY

01:53:34.040 --> 01:53:35.642
IS GOING TO PUT FAMILIES AT RISK

01:53:35.708 --> 01:53:37.410
WE ALSO REALLY ENCOURAGE THE

01:53:37.477 --> 01:53:38.611
GOOD BECAUSE EXEMPTION WOULD

01:53:38.678 --> 01:53:39.979
NEED THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME

01:53:40.046 --> 01:53:41.414
FAMILIES THAT.

01:53:41.481 --> 01:53:43.550
FOR REASONS BEYOND THEIR CONTROL

01:53:43.616 --> 01:53:44.984
IT GOES PAST THAT THEY CAN'T

01:53:45.051 --> 01:53:46.786
JUST LOSE FUNDING OVER THINGS

01:53:46.853 --> 01:53:48.354
THAT ARE NOT UNDER THEIR CONTROL.

01:53:48.421 --> 01:53:52.292
IT HARMS NOT ONLY THESE FAMILIES

01:53:52.358 --> 01:53:52.892
BUT ALSO THE CHILDREN IN THEIR

01:53:52.959 --> 01:53:54.661
CARE.

NOW WE HAVE TO OBVIOUSLY

01:54:01.568 --> 01:54:02.936
CONTINUE BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT

01:54:03.002 --> 01:54:04.204
TO LOSE THAT AGAIN PUTTING IN

01:54:04.270 --> 01:54:05.505
DANGER THOSE FAMILIES.

01:54:05.572 --> 01:54:08.208
THAT HAVE STEPPED UP TO SUPPORT

01:54:08.274 --> 01:54:11.077
THOSE CHILDREN SOUL WHAT CAN WE

01:54:11.144 --> 01:54:14.447
TOGETHER DO AND OUT WHAT

01:54:14.514 --> 01:54:16.716

01:54:26.926 --> 01:54:28.962
CONVERSATION AMONGST MULTIPLE

01:54:29.028 --> 01:54:30.029

ADMINISTRATION AND COUNTIES IN

01:54:31.664 --> 01:54:32.899
THE LEGISLATURE.

01:54:32.966 --> 01:54:34.634
RESULTED IN A GOOD SOLUTION TO A

01:54:34.701 --> 01:54:36.202

PERSONALLY SEEN IT SO I I'M NOT

02:02:17.897 --> 02:02:18.497
QUALIFIED PROBABLY TO TALK ABOUT

02:02:18.564 --> 02:02:19.331
IT I WILL TELL YOU THAT SCHOOL

02:02:19.398 --> 02:02:21.033

02:02:21.100 --> 02:02:22.501
REALIGNED IN TWENTY ELEVEN TO

02:02:22.568 --> 02:02:24.270
COUNTIES SO STATE VISIBILITY

02:02:24.336 --> 02:02:25.705
INTO EXACTLY WHAT'S BEING SPENT

02:02:25.771 --> 02:02:26.639
TODAY AND HOW.

02:02:26.706 --> 02:02:28.708
MUCH A CASE COSTS IS SOMEWHAT

02:02:28.774 --> 02:02:31.243
LIMITED.

02:02:31.310 --> 02:02:32.912
JUST IMPRISONMENT FINANCE WHO I

02:02:32.978 --> 02:02:33.446
BELIEVE -- THERE'S ALSO

02:02:33.512 --> 02:02:35.648
COMPANION LEGISLATION THAT'S

02:02:35.715 --> 02:02:37.149
RELATED TO THAT SO I THINK IT'S

02:02:37.216 --> 02:02:40.419
A ASSEMBLY BILL -- THREE THREE

02:02:40.486 --> 02:02:42.688
SEVEN AND AND FINANCES -- I

02:02:42.755 --> 02:02:45.458
BELIEVE OUR ANALYSIS MIGHT BE

02:02:45.524 --> 02:02:47.093
OUT I'M NOT SURE BUT I THERE

02:02:47.159 --> 02:02:49.762
MIGHT BE SOME QUESTIONS WITH THE

02:02:49.829 --> 02:02:51.797
THE ACTUAL LAST IMMINENT -- WE

02:02:51.864 --> 02:02:53.365
HAVEN'T REALLY DUG DEEP INTO

02:02:53.432 --> 02:02:55.601
EVERYTHING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

02:02:55.668 --> 02:02:57.002
THE CASELOAD IS AND BECAUSE

02:02:57.069 --> 02:02:58.204
THERE'S A LOT OF COMPONENTS THAT

02:02:58.270 --> 02:02:59.538
GO INTO THIS SOME.

02:02:59.605 --> 02:03:01.574
OF THE WAY THE PROGRAM WORKS --

02:03:01.640 --> 02:03:02.441
FOR THOSE FAMILIES THAT ARE

02:03:02.508 --> 02:03:04.443
APPROVED IN YOUR FUNDING AMOUNT

02:03:04.510 --> 02:03:05.978
IS DEPENDENT UPON YOUR MILEAGE

02:03:06.045 --> 02:03:07.546
FROM THE HOME.

02:03:07.613 --> 02:03:11.450
OR IF -- IT'S A A MONTHLY BUS

02:03:11.517 --> 02:03:13.085
STIPEND AND SO ON SO.

02:03:13.152 --> 02:03:16.055
THE SIMPLE ANSWER FOR YOU IS --

02:03:16.122 --> 02:03:17.156
WE'RE NOT SURE IF THAT'S THE

02:03:17.223 --> 02:03:18.791
CORRECT ESTIMATE WE'RE NOT SURE

02:03:18.858 --> 02:03:21.093
IF IT'S TO HIRE IF IT'S TOO LOW --

02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:22.128
BUT THERE ARE BECAUSE THERE ARE

02:03:22.194 --> 02:03:26.966
SOME VARIABLES TO LOOK INTO ON

02:03:27.032 --> 02:03:28.100
THAT -- SO.

02:03:28.167 --> 02:03:29.435
I I WON'T SAY WHAT YOU DON'T

02:03:29.502 --> 02:03:32.538
WANT ME TO SAY -- BUT BUT WE I I

02:03:32.605 --> 02:03:33.606
I CAN DOUBLE CHECK FOR YOU AND

02:03:33.672 --> 02:03:34.373
FIND OUT OF OUR ANALYSIS IS

02:03:34.440 --> 02:03:37.042
PUBLIC RIGHT AND AND AND HOW.

02:03:37.109 --> 02:03:38.611
NOT ONLY -- IF THE ANALYSIS IS

02:03:38.677 --> 02:03:39.278
CORRECT BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO

02:03:39.345 --> 02:03:40.179
DETERMINE.

02:03:40.246 --> 02:03:43.482
IF IT IS TOO HIGH OR TOO LOW --

02:03:43.549 --> 02:03:45.017
I THOUGHT THAT WAS A A KIND OF

02:03:45.084 --> 02:03:47.653
AN ACCOUNTING TYPE OF ISSUE WELL

02:03:47.720 --> 02:03:48.687
IT'S JUST IT'S LIKE USUAL

02:03:48.754 --> 02:03:49.588
EVERYTHING IS AN ESTIMATE FOR

02:03:49.655 --> 02:03:50.256
ITS RIGHT BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW

02:03:50.322 --> 02:03:51.724
WHAT THE CASE THAT IS GOING TO

02:03:51.791 --> 02:03:52.925
BE AWARE YOUTH MAY.

02:03:52.992 --> 02:03:55.294
NOT BE PLACED -- GETS A ONE BY

02:03:55.361 --> 02:03:56.295
ONE TIME A YOUTH COULD

02:03:56.362 --> 02:03:57.630
POTENTIALLY BE PLACED. THREE

02:03:57.696 --> 02:03:59.765
MILES FROM -- THEIR SCHOOL BOARD

02:03:59.832 --> 02:04:01.066
CHEN AND THEN A NEW PLACE

02:04:01.133 --> 02:04:02.868
SPENDING GREG IF YOU WANT TO ADD

02:04:02.935 --> 02:04:03.469
ANYTHING.

02:04:03.536 --> 02:04:04.203
THEY COULD BE PLACED SOMEWHERE

02:04:04.270 --> 02:04:06.572
WHERE IT'S TEN MILES AWAY SO --

02:04:06.639 --> 02:04:08.407
WE WE DO TAKE AND ALL THOSE

02:04:08.474 --> 02:04:10.042
CONSIDERATIONS WITH WORKING WITH --

02:04:10.109 --> 02:04:11.944
THE DEPARTMENT WHEN WE TRY TO

02:04:12.011 --> 02:04:16.916
COME UP WITH THAT CEMENT SO

02:04:16.982 --> 02:04:18.184
YOU'RE CORRECT THERE'S NO.

02:04:18.250 --> 02:04:19.251
PERFECT POINT WE CAN SAY EXACTLY

02:04:19.318 --> 02:04:20.319
WHAT IT IS BUT WE NEED TO TRY TO

02:04:20.386 --> 02:04:21.453
DO OUR BEST TO TO GIVE AN

02:04:21.520 --> 02:04:22.588
ACCURATE OR A BEST ESTIMATE FOR

02:04:22.655 --> 02:04:24.423
THE LEGISLATURE WHEN WE MAKE OUR

02:04:24.490 --> 02:04:25.224
ANALYSES.

02:04:25.291 --> 02:04:26.192
REGRETS THE DEPARTMENT I JUST

02:04:26.258 --> 02:04:27.059
SAY TO HISTORICALLY WHAT WE DO

02:04:27.126 --> 02:04:29.328
WE OFTEN DO IS LOOK AT PREVIOUS

02:04:29.395 --> 02:04:30.763
EXPENDITURES FOR A SIMILAR --

02:04:30.830 --> 02:04:32.331

02:04:35.334 --> 02:04:36.502
WE CAN LOOK AT THOSE PREVIOUS

02:04:36.569 --> 02:04:37.403
EXPENDITURES.

02:04:37.469 --> 02:04:40.105
AS AS AS MISTER SPEAKER JUST

02:04:40.172 --> 02:04:42.308

REALIGNMENT THAT THE PRECISION

02:04:43.642 --> 02:04:45.978
OF THE OF KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT

02:04:46.045 --> 02:04:47.680
WAS SPENT -- IS IS A LITTLE LESS

02:04:47.746 --> 02:04:51.217
PRECISE THAN IT HAS HISTORICALLY

02:04:51.283 --> 02:04:52.384
BEEN BUT THERE ARE SOME.

02:04:52.451 --> 02:04:53.385
WAYS IN WHICH WE COULD PARTNER

02:04:53.452 --> 02:04:54.386
WITH FINANCE AND THE ADVOCATES

02:04:54.453 --> 02:04:55.287

CARE TO AGE TWENTY ONE IN?

02:22:44.555 --> 02:22:44.989
TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THE

02:22:45.056 --> 02:22:45.890
POPULATION SERVED BY TEACH

02:22:45.957 --> 02:22:48.559
PEOPLE PLUS CHANGED CONSIDERABLY.

02:22:48.626 --> 02:22:51.496
INSTEAD OF LARGELY SERVING

02:22:51.562 --> 02:22:52.530
EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY ONE YEAR OLDS

02:22:52.597 --> 02:22:55.566
THP PLUS NOW SERVES OLDER MORE

02:22:55.633 --> 02:22:57.302
VULNERABLE FORMER FOSTER YOUTH.

02:22:57.368 --> 02:22:58.536
THIS INCLUDES PRIMARILY

02:22:58.603 --> 02:23:00.338
CUSTODIAL PARENTS AND YOUTH WITH

02:23:00.405 --> 02:23:01.606
DISABILITIES.

02:23:01.673 --> 02:23:03.374
TEACH PEOPLE ALSO SERVES AS A

02:23:03.441 --> 02:23:05.276
VALUABLE SAFETY NET FOR A NOT

02:23:05.343 --> 02:23:06.945
SMALL BUT LARGELY INVISIBLE

02:23:07.011 --> 02:23:08.513
GROUP OF YOUNG PEOPLE THESE ARE

02:23:08.579 --> 02:23:10.949
YOUNG PEOPLE AGED EIGHTEEN TO

02:23:11.015 --> 02:23:11.716
TWENTY ONE WHO DON'T QUALIFY FOR

02:23:11.783 --> 02:23:13.217
EXTENDED FOSTER CARE.

02:23:13.284 --> 02:23:14.752
THIS IS A GROUP THAT WE WE VERY

02:23:14.819 --> 02:23:18.556
RARELY SPEAK OF AND UTILIZE

02:23:18.623 --> 02:23:19.490
TEACH PEOPLE IT'S CONSIDERABLY.

02:23:19.557 --> 02:23:21.025
THIS PROGRAM IS BEEN EVALUATED

02:23:21.092 --> 02:23:22.460
EVERY YEAR SINCE.

02:23:22.527 --> 02:23:23.294
TWO THOUSAND SIX A CONSISTENTLY

02:23:23.361 --> 02:23:25.196
FOUND TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR

02:23:25.263 --> 02:23:27.031
YOUTH NOTABLY IN AREAS OF

02:23:27.098 --> 02:23:28.766
HOUSING STABILITY MONTHLY

02:23:28.833 --> 02:23:29.901
EARNINGS AND EMPLOYMENT.

02:23:29.968 --> 02:23:31.803
SO CLEARLY THIS IS A WELL

02:23:31.869 --> 02:23:33.371
ESTABLISHED EFFECTIVE STATE

02:23:33.438 --> 02:23:34.739
PROGRAM.

02:23:34.806 --> 02:23:36.407
HOWEVER IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN

02:23:36.474 --> 02:23:38.743
THIS PROGRAM IS AT RISK.

02:23:38.810 --> 02:23:39.744
THE STATE BUDGET FOR TEACH

02:23:39.811 --> 02:23:40.578
PEOPLE PLUS HAS REMAINED

02:23:40.645 --> 02:23:43.748
UNCHANGED SINCE.

02:23:43.815 --> 02:23:44.349
TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN DURING THE

02:23:44.415 --> 02:23:45.984
SAME SENSE THAT SAME PERIOD OF

02:23:46.050 --> 02:23:47.085
TIME THE COST OF HOUSING

02:23:47.151 --> 02:23:48.353
CALIFORNIA.

02:23:48.419 --> 02:23:50.888
HAS INCREASED BY 50%.

02:23:50.955 --> 02:23:52.957
SO NOT SURPRISINGLY AS THE

02:23:53.024 --> 02:23:53.992
DEMAND FOR HOUSING HAS

02:23:54.058 --> 02:23:56.661
SKYROCKETED SO HAS DEMAND FOR

02:23:56.728 --> 02:23:58.129
THIS VITAL SAFETY NET PROGRAM.

02:23:58.196 --> 02:24:00.231
WE DID A MOMENT IN TIME SNAPSHOT

02:24:00.298 --> 02:24:03.101
IN A AND IN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND

02:24:03.167 --> 02:24:04.235
EIGHTEEN THERE WERE OVER FOUR

02:24:04.302 --> 02:24:05.269
HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN ELIGIBLE

02:24:05.336 --> 02:24:06.871
YOUTH WAITING TO ENTER TEACH

02:24:06.938 --> 02:24:07.972
PEOPLE PLUS.

02:24:08.039 --> 02:24:09.340
LOS ANGELES AND SAN DIEGO

02:24:09.407 --> 02:24:11.109
COUNTIES EACH HAD A WAITING LIST

02:24:11.175 --> 02:24:13.211
OF OUR FIFTY YOUNG PEOPLE AGAIN

02:24:13.277 --> 02:24:15.079
OVER HALF OF WHO ARE CUSTODIAL

02:24:15.146 --> 02:24:16.180
PARENTS.

02:24:16.247 --> 02:24:17.715
THESE ARE FORMER FOSTER YOUTH

02:24:17.782 --> 02:24:20.585
WHO WERE IN CARE UNTIL AGE.

02:24:20.651 --> 02:24:21.285
EIGHTEEN WE'RE NOT ABLE TO

02:24:21.352 --> 02:24:23.988
ACHIEVE PERMANENCE AND NOW FIND

02:24:24.055 --> 02:24:26.257
THEMSELVES YOU DON'T.

02:24:26.324 --> 02:24:27.492
SEVERAL YEARS AFTER HOMELESS.

02:24:27.558 --> 02:24:28.726
SO THE CURRENT BUDGET PROPOSAL

02:24:28.793 --> 02:24:30.128
IS AN EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR

02:24:30.194 --> 02:24:31.729
INVESTMENT TEACH PEOPLE US.

02:24:31.796 --> 02:24:33.731
THIS WOULD ALLOW THE EXPANSION

02:24:33.798 --> 02:24:35.633
OF THIS VITAL SAFETY NET PROGRAM

02:24:35.700 --> 02:24:37.735
IT WOULD ALSO SLIGHTLY MODIFIED

02:24:37.802 --> 02:24:39.270
THE ELIGIBILITY FOR THE PROGRAM

02:24:39.337 --> 02:24:41.072
REALLY IT'S CLOSING MORE OF A OF

02:24:41.139 --> 02:24:42.073
A LOOPHOLE.

02:24:42.140 --> 02:24:43.674
CURRENTLY TO BE IN THIS PROGRAM

02:24:43.741 --> 02:24:46.244
YOU HAVE TO BE IN CARE AT AGE

02:24:46.310 --> 02:24:47.145
EIGHTEEN IT WOULD SLIGHTLY

02:24:47.211 --> 02:24:48.513
MODIFY THE PROGRAM SO THAT IF

02:24:48.579 --> 02:24:50.548
YOU WERE IN CARE BETWEEN SIXTEEN

02:24:50.615 --> 02:24:52.683
AND EIGHTEEN IF YOU LATER BECAME

02:24:52.750 --> 02:24:53.851
HOMELESS YOU COULD.

02:24:53.918 --> 02:24:55.553
PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM THERE

02:24:55.620 --> 02:24:56.821
ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF YOUNG

02:24:56.888 --> 02:24:58.322
PEOPLE WHO CHEAT PERMITS DURING

02:24:58.389 --> 02:24:59.824
THAT TWO YEAR WINDOW.

02:24:59.891 --> 02:25:02.026
HOWEVER THESE YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE

02:25:02.093 --> 02:25:03.594
LARGELY THE SAME EXPERIENCE OF

02:25:03.661 --> 02:25:04.629
YOUNG PEOPLE WHO REMAINING CARE

02:25:04.695 --> 02:25:07.131
TELL EIGHTEEN AND YET WE CUT OFF

02:25:07.198 --> 02:25:08.499
ACCESS TO THIS VITAL PROGRAM.

02:25:08.566 --> 02:25:10.802
AND WE ACTUALLY CREATE A

02:25:10.868 --> 02:25:11.869
DISINCENTIVE FOR PERMANENCE.

02:25:11.936 --> 02:25:13.004
SO THIS IS A VERY LONG STANDING

02:25:13.071 --> 02:25:14.806
SUCCESSFUL STATE PROGRAM THAT IS

02:25:14.872 --> 02:25:16.407
REALLY OFFERED A BETTER BRIGHTER

02:25:16.474 --> 02:25:18.976

02:47:02.879 --> 02:47:03.747
OUT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT'S BEEN

02:47:03.813 --> 02:47:05.582
I I THOUGHT IT WAS TWO YEARS NOT

02:47:05.648 --> 02:47:07.016
THREE UNDER DISCUSSION -- I

02:47:07.083 --> 02:47:08.184
THINK THERE'S BEEN SOME BACK AND

02:47:08.251 --> 02:47:09.886
FORTH THERE I'M NOT PERSONALLY

02:47:09.953 --> 02:47:11.521
FAMILIAR WITH THAT SO I I'M NOT

02:47:11.588 --> 02:47:12.989
SURE WHAT THE STATUS OF THOSE

02:47:13.056 --> 02:47:15.392
CONVERSATIONS ARE.

02:47:15.458 --> 02:47:16.893
THE STAFF IS YEAH GREG ROSE THE

02:47:16.960 --> 02:47:17.694
DEPARTMENT WE'VE BEEN WE HAVE

AT WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR SOME

02:47:32.108 --> 02:47:33.843
ACTUAL LANGUAGE TOOK TOOK TAKE A

02:47:33.910 --> 02:47:35.779
LOOK AT SO THAT WE CAN -- SEE IN

02:47:35.845 --> 02:47:40.483
FACT IF THE IF THE THAT THAT

02:47:40.550 --> 02:47:41.484
THAT THE NARROWNESS THAT THAT

02:47:41.551 --> 02:47:42.318
HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS

02:47:42.385 --> 02:47:45.522
ARTICULATED THERE AS WELL -- ARE

02:47:45.588 --> 02:47:46.055
ARE ARE.

02:47:46.122 --> 02:47:47.257
CLEARLY WE AREN'T INTERESTED WE

02:47:47.323 --> 02:47:48.591
ARE WE ARE INTERESTED IN NOT

02:47:48.658 --> 02:47:50.326
HAVING YOUNG PEOPLE FALL THROUGH

02:47:50.393 --> 02:47:52.495
THE CRACKS BECAUSE OF SOME KIND

02:47:52.562 --> 02:47:54.464
OF YOU KNOW DELAY IN COURT OR

02:47:54.531 --> 02:48:01.237
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS -- THE THE

02:48:01.304 --> 02:48:02.372
NUMBER THAT WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN

02:48:02.439 --> 02:48:03.807
AND BECAUSE WE DON'T A WE HAVE A

02:48:03.873 --> 02:48:04.908
HARD TIME ACTUALLY VERIFYING

02:48:04.974 --> 02:48:07.210
THEM -- ARE IN FACT VERY SMALL

02:48:07.277 --> 02:48:08.778
SO -- I WE WE WERE WAITING ON

02:48:08.845 --> 02:48:09.612
SOME LANGUAGE AND WE ARE GOING

02:48:09.679 --> 02:48:10.280
TO FINISH CRUNCH IN SOME NUMBERS

02:48:10.346 --> 02:48:11.481
AND AND AND PRIVATE PROVIDING

02:48:11.548 --> 02:48:13.817
THAT BACK TO THE TO THE THE

02:48:13.883 --> 02:48:16.286
ADVOCATES. TO THE THE EARLIEST

02:48:16.352 --> 02:48:18.288
WE CAN GET THE UPDATED CASELOAD

02:48:18.354 --> 02:48:20.256
NUMBERS.

02:48:20.323 --> 02:48:22.492
RETHINKING A MONTH.

02:48:22.559 --> 02:48:23.626
LESS -- LESS LESS THAN LESS THAN

02:48:23.693 --> 02:48:24.260
A MONTH I MEAN WE'RE BASED ON

02:48:24.327 --> 02:48:25.462
THAT THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

02:48:25.528 --> 02:48:26.863
THAT THEY'VE ASKED FOR WE SHOULD

02:48:26.930 --> 02:48:28.665
BE ABLE TO ONCE WE HAVE THE THE

02:48:28.731 --> 02:48:30.533
THE THE THAT THAT LANGUAGE BE

02:48:30.600 --> 02:48:33.269
ABLE TO TO VERIFY IT TO TO COME

02:48:33.336 --> 02:48:35.672
UP WITH SOME.

02:48:35.738 --> 02:48:37.974
NUMBER -- AND THEN IT HAS TO BE

02:48:38.041 --> 02:48:39.342
PART OF THE OVERALL BUDGET

02:48:39.409 --> 02:48:40.210
PROCESS.

02:48:40.276 --> 02:48:41.711
TO RECONCILE EVERYTHING BUT

02:48:41.778 --> 02:48:43.580
CERTAINLY WE CAN DO THAT.

02:48:43.646 --> 02:48:44.814
IT REALLY APPEARS LIKE A

02:48:44.881 --> 02:48:48.318
BUREAUCRATIC ISSUE YES -- I I

02:48:48.384 --> 02:48:50.553
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE ARE

02:48:50.620 --> 02:48:51.921
DAHLE SUPPORTING THIS.

02:48:51.988 --> 02:48:53.256
BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT ONCE WE

02:48:53.323 --> 02:48:54.657
HAVE THE NUMBERS AND PERHAPS

02:48:54.724 --> 02:48:55.825
WILL BE ABLE TO MOVE.

02:48:55.892 --> 02:48:57.727
IS THERE ANY REASON TO BELIEVE

02:48:57.794 --> 02:48:59.529
THAT THE NUMBER.

02:48:59.596 --> 02:49:02.532
IS LARGER THAN THE CASE THAT THE

02:49:02.599 --> 02:49:03.833
CASELOAD THAT THE LA -- HAS

02:49:03.900 --> 02:49:08.137
ESTIMATED.

02:49:08.204 --> 02:49:09.873
I THINK THAT WE I DON'T I DON'T

02:49:09.939 --> 02:49:11.674
BELIEVE WE HAVE ANY INFORMATION

02:49:11.741 --> 02:49:13.710
THAT WOULD BE DIFFERENT THAN THE

02:49:13.776 --> 02:49:17.080
LA -- TESTAMENT [inaudible]

02:49:17.146 --> 02:49:18.214
THE END.

02:49:18.281 --> 02:49:20.450
FINALLY I THINK THIS IS

02:49:20.517 --> 02:49:21.784
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IS

02:49:21.851 --> 02:49:23.953
CONSIDERING.

02:49:24.020 --> 02:49:26.422
THAT THIS IS A RELATIVELY SMALL

02:49:26.489 --> 02:49:29.158
GROUP WAS THE SMALL NUMBER -- IN

02:49:29.225 --> 02:49:31.294
DESPERATE CIRCUMSTANCES I THINK

02:49:31.361 --> 02:49:33.863
THAT THAT IS CLEAR AND ALSO FROM

02:49:33.930 --> 02:49:37.400
ASSEMBLYMEMBER GIBSON'S --

02:49:37.467 --> 02:49:39.936
TESTIMONY OF THROUGH NO FAULT OF

02:49:40.003 --> 02:49:41.170
THEIR OWN.

02:49:41.237 --> 02:49:46.776
THAT IS CLEAR -- ARE THERE ANY

02:49:46.843 --> 02:49:49.012
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT.

02:49:49.078 --> 02:49:51.014
DO NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AS A

02:49:51.080 --> 02:49:56.686
RESULT OF AS A RESULT OF THIS.

02:49:56.753 --> 02:49:58.321
AGAIN I THINK IT WILL BE ONLY

02:49:58.388 --> 02:50:00.590
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE -- THAT I

02:50:00.657 --> 02:50:03.793
COULD IMAGINE IS -- IS IF THERE

02:50:03.860 --> 02:50:06.229
ARE SOME IF THE THE L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G THE&lt;/c&gt;

02:50:06.296 --> 02:50:08.097
LANGUAGE THAT WOULD -- THAT IS

02:50:08.164 --> 02:50:10.833
BEING CLARIFIED SOMEHOW HAS A

02:50:10.900 --> 02:50:13.403
HAS HAS AN OPENING IN IT THAT

02:50:13.469 --> 02:50:16.639
WHERE THAT IS IS IN IS DIFFERENT

02:50:16.706 --> 02:50:17.540
THAN WHAT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED

02:50:17.607 --> 02:50:19.108
MADE BUT I'M WAITING TO ACTUALLY

02:50:19.175 --> 02:50:22.278
SEE THE THE SPECIFIC THE THE

02:50:22.345 --> 02:50:23.212
SPECIFIC LANGUAGE OTHERWISE.

02:50:23.279 --> 02:50:24.814
ANY ENDED THE ONLY UNINTENDED

02:50:24.881 --> 02:50:26.883
CONSEQUENCES COULD BE DOES DOES

02:50:26.950 --> 02:50:28.418
THAT IS THERE ANY KIND OF

02:50:28.484 --> 02:50:30.386
PERVERSE INCENTIVE FOR FAMILIES

02:50:30.453 --> 02:50:32.622
TO NOT DO THE RIGHT THING AND

02:50:32.689 --> 02:50:35.191
HAVE THEIR YOUNG PEOPLE AND UP --

02:50:35.258 --> 02:50:36.693
IT IN EXTENDED FOSTER CARE

02:50:36.759 --> 02:50:38.695
THERE'S BEEN -- THERE HAVE BEEN

02:50:38.761 --> 02:50:40.763
OTHER STATES WHO HAVE EXPERIENCE

02:50:40.830 --> 02:50:43.132
THAT -- NOT IN THIS SPECIFIC

02:50:43.199 --> 02:50:44.634
INCH IS INSTANCE BUT THAT WOULD

02:50:44.701 --> 02:50:45.501
BE THE ONLY THING I WOULD SAY WE

02:50:45.568 --> 02:50:47.203
HAVE TO GUARD WE WOULD WANT TO

02:50:47.270 --> 02:50:47.570
GUARD AGAINST.

02:50:47.637 --> 02:50:49.739
I HAVE NO INDICATION AT THIS

02:50:49.806 --> 02:50:51.107
POINT THAT THERE WILL BE.

02:50:51.174 --> 02:50:52.909
ON UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES BUT

02:50:52.976 --> 02:50:54.577

ACTUALLY SEE THE PROPOSED

02:50:55.979 --> 02:50:57.847
LANGUAGE I THINK WE WON'T BE

02:50:57.914 --> 02:50:59.449
ABLE TO BE AS DEFINITIVE THAT

02:50:59.515 --> 02:51:03.286
YOU'D LIKE US TO BE AT THE

02:51:03.353 --> 02:51:07.523

THE TESTIMONY THAT WAS GIVEN --

02:52:17.260 --> 02:52:19.462
IN AND PRIOR IT REALLY GOES TO A

02:52:19.529 --> 02:52:21.297
PASSION -- THAT WE'VE SPOKEN

02:52:21.364 --> 02:52:22.732
ABOUT ALSO WITH THE HOMELESS

02:52:22.799 --> 02:52:24.267
YOUTH IN IN THE STATE OF

02:52:24.333 --> 02:52:25.935
CALIFORNIA BEING MORE PROACTIVE

02:52:26.002 --> 02:52:27.303
IN MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S

02:52:27.370 --> 02:52:28.171
RESOURCES THAT ARE THERE FOR

02:52:28.237 --> 02:52:28.838
THEM.

02:52:28.905 --> 02:52:30.506

PROACTIVE MEASURE -- TO KEEP A

02:52:39.248 --> 02:52:41.084
BALANCE ON FINANCIAL RESOURCES

02:52:41.150 --> 02:52:42.385
ARE BEING USED IN THE FUTURE

02:52:42.452 --> 02:52:42.952
BECAUSE OF WERE ABLE TO BE

02:52:43.019 --> 02:52:44.487
PROACTIVE GET THOSE RESOURCES

02:52:44.554 --> 02:52:46.489
NOW THAT WE HAVE THAT GREATER

02:52:46.556 --> 02:52:47.724
IMPACT ON THE HOMELESS YOUTH

02:52:47.790 --> 02:52:50.193
POPULATION THAT WERE SEEN.

02:52:50.259 --> 02:52:52.562
IN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

02:52:52.628 --> 02:52:53.696
GEN SEEN THOSE THINGS MOVE

02:52:53.763 --> 02:52:54.263
FORWARD.

02:52:54.330 --> 02:52:55.465
WE WE WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF

02:52:55.531 --> 02:52:56.733
THIS MOVING FORWARD BUT WHEN YOU

02:52:58.267 --> 02:52:59.602
MIND THAT ASPECT OF IT IN THE

02:52:59.669 --> 02:53:00.937
SAVINGS THAT WILL HAPPEN DOWN

02:53:01.003 --> 02:53:01.904
THE ROAD.

02:59:48.344 --> 02:59:50.112
SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE

02:59:50.179 --> 02:59:50.779
ISSUE FORWARD.

02:59:50.846 --> 02:59:51.947
OBVIOUSLY REDUCING THE

02:59:52.014 --> 02:59:53.315
CRIMINALIZATION OF YOUTH AND

02:59:53.382 --> 02:59:55.484
THEIR BEHAVIORS IS A GOOD THING

02:59:55.551 --> 02:59:57.386
WE WENT ALL SUPPORT THAT -- I I

02:59:57.453 --> 02:59:58.654
WOULD SAY IT'S PROBABLY TOO

02:59:58.721 --> 02:59:59.755
EARLY TO TELL WHETHER THE MONEY

02:59:59.822 --> 03:00:00.723
THAT WAS IN THE CURRENT YEAR

03:00:00.789 --> 03:00:02.691
BUDGET IS HAVING AN IMPACT OR

03:00:02.758 --> 03:00:04.493
THE IMPACT THAT WAS INTENDED OF

03:00:04.560 --> 03:00:04.894
IT.

03:00:04.960 --> 03:00:06.095
THE COMMENT THAT I'VE MADE

03:00:06.162 --> 03:00:07.630
PREVIOUSLY ABOUT YOU KNOW WHEN

03:00:07.696 --> 03:00:09.064
WE MAKE AN INVESTMENT WHAT ARE

03:00:09.131 --> 03:00:11.534
WE GETTING FOR IT WHAT WE EXPECT

03:00:11.600 --> 03:00:12.501
TO SEE FOR IT.

03:00:12.568 --> 03:00:14.403
PER SHARE THE CLARIFICATION THIS

03:00:14.470 --> 03:00:15.871
IS A ONE TIME REQUEST.

03:00:15.938 --> 03:00:17.273
THAT COMES ALONG WITH SOME

03:00:17.339 --> 03:00:18.607
CONCERNS ABOUT STARTING

03:00:18.674 --> 03:00:20.009
SOMETHING AND THEN STOPPING

03:00:20.075 --> 03:00:22.711
SOMETHING OR WHAT COMES NEXT AS

03:00:22.778 --> 03:00:24.346
THE NEXT STOP FOR THESE

03:00:24.413 --> 03:00:26.015
PROVIDERS AS THEY EXPAND THE

03:00:26.081 --> 03:00:26.882
CAPACITY.

03:00:26.949 --> 03:00:29.118
UP SO AGAIN COMING BACK TO THE

03:00:29.185 --> 03:00:31.153
HOW DO WE PROVE THAT IT WORKS SO

03:00:31.220 --> 03:00:32.021
THAT WE KNOW WHETHER WE WANT TO

03:00:32.087 --> 03:00:34.156
CONTINUE IN THE FUTURE OR NOT.

03:00:34.223 --> 03:00:35.624
SO THOSE WOULD BE SOME KINDS OF

03:00:35.691 --> 03:00:37.126
THE QUESTIONS I WOULD

03:00:37.193 --> 03:00:39.595
ADDITIONALLY NOTE -- AND COULD

03:00:39.662 --> 03:00:40.696
PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE DONE IT

03:00:40.763 --> 03:00:42.531
EARLIER THERE'S A LOT OF OVERLAP

03:00:42.598 --> 03:00:44.567
IN THE ADDRESSING OF THE ISSUES

03:00:44.633 --> 03:00:46.335
BETWEEN THE VARIOUS PROPOSALS

03:00:46.402 --> 03:00:48.070
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY.

03:00:48.137 --> 03:00:50.072
YOU HEARD THP PLUS TALK ABOUT

03:00:50.139 --> 03:00:52.541
BAD CAPACITY AN INCREASE IN THE

03:00:52.608 --> 03:00:53.909
NUMBER OF BEDS AVAILABLE.

03:00:53.976 --> 03:00:56.245
THEN WE HEARD A PROPOSAL ABOUT --

03:00:56.312 --> 03:00:58.214
AT ADVOCATING FOR NAVIGATORS TO

03:00:58.280 --> 03:01:00.883
HELP PEOPLE FIND PLACES TO STAY

03:01:00.950 --> 03:01:01.684
HERE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

03:01:01.750 --> 03:01:03.319
HELPING THEM ACHIEVE PERMANENCY

03:01:03.385 --> 03:01:04.520
WHEN THEY'RE ALREADY IN A

03:01:04.587 --> 03:01:06.722
CONGREGATE CARE SITUATION.

03:01:06.789 --> 03:01:08.524
AND DIVERTING THEM FROM CRIMINAL

03:01:08.591 --> 03:01:09.992
JUSTICE SO THERE'S A CERTAIN

03:01:10.059 --> 03:01:12.261
PIECE TO THAT WE WOULD LIKE A

03:01:12.328 --> 03:01:13.696
PART IN THE CONVERSATION NOT

03:01:13.762 --> 03:01:14.897
JUST WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO

03:01:14.964 --> 03:01:16.198
ACHIEVE IN ARE WE GETTING AT BUT

03:01:16.265 --> 03:01:17.333
ALSO HOW DO THESE THINGS

03:01:17.399 --> 03:01:18.834
INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER SO IT'S

03:01:18.901 --> 03:01:24.773
A MORE COMPLICATED CONVERSATION.

03:01:24.840 --> 03:01:25.541
VALID ISSUE AND AGAIN FIRST

03:01:25.608 --> 03:01:26.475
THING I SAID REDUCING THE

03:01:26.542 --> 03:01:27.076
CRIMINALIZATION OF YOUTH AND

03:01:27.142 --> 03:01:28.510
THEIR BEHAVIORS IS A REALLY

03:01:28.577 --> 03:01:29.078
IMPORTANT HUMAN THING TO BE

03:01:29.144 --> 03:01:32.948
DOING.

03:01:33.015 --> 03:01:35.017
BERMAN FINANCE -- ARE JUST

03:01:35.084 --> 03:01:36.118
INTEREST FROM FINANCE ANSWERED

03:01:36.185 --> 03:01:37.052
LIKE THAT ON THE ADMINISTRATION

03:01:37.119 --> 03:01:38.053
HAS TAKEN SOME APPROACHES ON

03:01:38.120 --> 03:01:39.188
THIS I BELIEVE -- REGULATIONS

03:01:39.255 --> 03:01:40.122
WERE JUST FINALIZED IN OCTOBER

03:01:40.189 --> 03:01:42.224
OF LAST YEAR TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE

03:01:42.291 --> 03:01:44.727
IN AND IT WITH -- A LOT OF THESE

03:01:44.793 --> 03:01:46.962
FACILITIES ON ADDRESS SCENE --

03:01:47.029 --> 03:01:48.297
PICTURED COULD END IN AN EFFORT

03:01:48.364 --> 03:01:49.999
TO LIMIT THE NEED FOR CALLING

03:01:50.065 --> 03:01:54.036
LAW ENFORCEMENT SO I JUST WANT

03:01:54.103 --> 03:01:55.437
TO ADD THAT ON THERE.

03:01:55.504 --> 03:01:56.005
THANK YOU AND I THINK YOU'RE

03:01:56.071 --> 03:01:57.072
CORRECTIVE PARENTS AREN'T GOING

03:01:57.139 --> 03:01:57.606
TO CALL.

03:01:57.673 --> 03:01:58.941
POLICE LAW ENFORCEMENT TO COME

03:01:59.008 --> 03:01:59.275
AND HELP THEM.

03:01:59.341 --> 03:02:01.043
OUT.

03:02:01.110 --> 03:02:02.578
SOLVE ISSUES THAT YOU'RE RIGHT

03:02:02.645 --> 03:02:05.447
THIS THE USER TEENS AND THEY'RE

03:02:05.514 --> 03:02:07.516
ACTING OUT AND BUT ONCE THEY'RE

03:02:07.583 --> 03:02:10.786
CRIMINALIZE ONCE THEY ARE PUT

03:02:10.853 --> 03:02:12.087
INTO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.

03:02:12.154 --> 03:02:13.789
THEN IT'S SO HARD TO GET THEM

03:02:13.856 --> 03:02:15.491
OUT BECAUSE THAT REMAINS WITH

03:02:15.557 --> 03:02:16.458
THEM.

03:02:16.525 --> 03:02:17.693
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING

03:02:17.760 --> 03:02:19.895

03:02:50.192 --> 03:02:52.061
MY NAME AGAIN IS DAVID DOWN WHEN

03:02:52.127 --> 03:02:53.262
I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR A

03:02:53.329 --> 03:02:55.064
NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION FOSTER

03:02:55.130 --> 03:02:58.600
FAMILY AGENCY THAT PROVIDES A

03:02:58.667 --> 03:02:59.134
ADOPTIONS AND FOSTER CARE

03:02:59.201 --> 03:03:00.569
SERVICES.

03:03:00.636 --> 03:03:02.004
AT LEAST FOR OUR AGENCY IN ANY

03:03:02.071 --> 03:03:04.840
GIVEN YEAR WE SERVE ABOUT A

03:03:04.907 --> 03:03:05.941
THOUSAND FOSTER CHILDREN.

03:03:06.008 --> 03:03:07.943
ARE PRIMARILY CHILDREN OF COLOR

03:03:08.010 --> 03:03:09.478
AND MINORITIES.

03:03:09.545 --> 03:03:11.246
I I WANT TO FIRST SAY THAT WE

03:03:11.313 --> 03:03:12.414
APPLIED.

03:03:12.481 --> 03:03:14.149
THE COMMITMENT FROM THE

03:03:14.216 --> 03:03:16.185
LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR. TO

03:03:16.251 --> 03:03:18.053
INCREASE THE WAGES AWFUL WORKERS

03:03:18.120 --> 03:03:19.888
BY RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE I

03:03:19.955 --> 03:03:21.323
THINK THAT'S A POSITIVE.

03:03:21.390 --> 03:03:22.658
FOR ALL THE WORKERS SEEN IN

03:03:22.725 --> 03:03:24.927
CALIFORNIA.

03:03:24.993 --> 03:03:26.662
I'M HERE TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT

03:03:26.729 --> 03:03:27.563
TO OUR BUDGET REQUEST THAT DEALS

03:03:27.629 --> 03:03:29.164
WITH THE IMPACT.

03:03:29.231 --> 03:03:30.666
THAT THE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES

03:03:30.733 --> 03:03:32.134
ON THE ABILITY OF THE NONPROFIT

03:03:32.201 --> 03:03:34.703
SUCH AS THE ONE THAT I WORKED

03:03:34.770 --> 03:03:38.340
WITH. TO PAY OUR SOCIAL WORKERS.

03:03:38.407 --> 03:03:39.742
THE STATE SAID IF A FAIR RATES

03:03:39.808 --> 03:03:40.309
FOR SOCIAL WORKERS HAVE BEEN

03:03:40.376 --> 03:03:43.078
FROZEN SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND

03:03:43.145 --> 03:03:46.915
ONE AND WERE CUT 10% IN.

03:03:46.982 --> 03:03:47.449
TWO THOUSAND NINE WE SAW A

03:03:47.516 --> 03:03:48.817
SLIGHT INCREASE OUR THREE YEARS

03:03:48.884 --> 03:03:50.352
AGO.

03:03:50.419 --> 03:03:52.221
BUT NOTHING CLOSE ENOUGH TO

03:03:52.287 --> 03:03:53.222
COVER THE COST OF INCREASING

03:03:53.288 --> 03:03:54.690
SOCIAL WORKER SALARIES.

03:03:54.757 --> 03:03:56.492
I THINK YOU KNOW WE ALL AGREE

03:03:56.558 --> 03:03:57.826
THAT SOCIAL WORKERS ARE GREAT

03:03:57.893 --> 03:04:00.295
ADVOCATES AND MENTORS WERE OUR

03:04:00.362 --> 03:04:01.430
FOSTER CHILDREN.

03:04:01.497 --> 03:04:03.365
IN THE SYSTEM.

03:04:03.432 --> 03:04:05.067
MAKING MATTERS WORSE FOR IF A

03:04:05.134 --> 03:04:05.401
FACE.

03:04:05.467 --> 03:04:07.403
THE STATE LAW REQUIRES THE EXAM

03:04:07.469 --> 03:04:09.538
PROFESSIONAL EMPLOYEES BE PAID

03:04:09.605 --> 03:04:11.140
DOUBLE THE MINIMUM WAGE.

03:04:11.206 --> 03:04:12.474
WHILE THE MINIMUM WAGE ACT

03:04:12.541 --> 03:04:15.177
MANDATES ANNUAL INCREASES TO THE

03:04:15.244 --> 03:04:17.045
STATE'S MINIMUM WEIGHT.

03:04:17.112 --> 03:04:18.914
FFA RAID DID NOT COVER THE COST

03:04:18.981 --> 03:04:20.549
OF PAYING OUR SOCIAL WORKERS

03:04:20.616 --> 03:04:22.885
DOUBLE THAT MINIMUM WAGE.

03:04:22.951 --> 03:04:24.486
NOT SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO DO

03:04:24.553 --> 03:04:26.255
WE DO WITH AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE

03:04:26.321 --> 03:04:27.523
FUNDING SOURCES.

03:04:27.589 --> 03:04:28.724
AND WE DON'T SEE ANY RATE

03:04:28.791 --> 03:04:30.025
INCREASES.

03:04:30.092 --> 03:04:32.528
IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

03:04:32.594 --> 03:04:34.263

WHO RECEIVE A MANUAL ADJUSTMENT.

03:04:38.267 --> 03:04:40.702
ONE IS THE FAA RATE AND SADLY

03:04:40.769 --> 03:04:43.305
THE OTHER ONE NEEDS FOR INFANT

03:04:43.372 --> 03:04:44.973
CARE SUPPLEMENT. TO COME INTO

03:04:45.040 --> 03:04:47.176

SO DO TO MY A A I'M GOING

03:10:13.335 --> 03:10:15.103
DILIGENCE THE CHILD WAS SAID

THE CHILD WAS A MINUTE A NEATLY

03:10:20.876 --> 03:10:21.543

DIFFERENT TYPES OF INFECTION

03:10:32.154 --> 03:10:33.421
AROUND THE TRACK AND IN THE

03:10:33.488 --> 03:10:35.323
TRICK AND THE DOCTORS THAT THE

03:10:35.390 --> 03:10:37.492
POINT TOLD ME THAT I SAY THAT

03:10:37.559 --> 03:10:38.527
CHILD'S LIFE.

03:10:38.593 --> 03:10:40.262
ANOTHER STORY I WANT TO MENTION

03:10:40.328 --> 03:10:42.130
IS THAT I HAVE A FOURTEEN YEAR

03:10:42.197 --> 03:10:43.231
OLD ON CONTROL DIABETIC.

03:10:43.298 --> 03:10:44.866

INSULIN DEPENDENT.

03:10:46.334 --> 03:10:47.736
OF THE SOCIAL WORKER NOTIFIED ME

03:10:47.803 --> 03:10:49.604
THAT THE SCHOOL SAID THAT THE

03:10:49.671 --> 03:10:51.406
CHILD'S BLOOD SUGAR WAS FIVE

03:10:51.473 --> 03:10:52.073
HUNDRED I ASKED THE SOCIAL WORK

03:10:52.140 --> 03:10:53.475
AND TAKE THE CHILD TO EMERGENCY

03:10:53.542 --> 03:10:54.810
ROOM TO HAVE THAT MEDICAL

03:10:54.876 --> 03:10:55.977
ASSESSMENT.

03:10:56.044 --> 03:10:57.512
DUE TO I HEARD ABOUT THE PAIR'S

03:10:57.579 --> 03:10:59.481
NOT COMPLIANCE AND UNSUPERVISED

03:10:59.548 --> 03:11:01.116
IN SUBDIVISION OF THE CHILD.

03:11:01.183 --> 03:11:02.417
ALSO I DID COMPLETED THE JOY

03:11:02.484 --> 03:11:04.886
HOME VISIT THAT SAME WEEK I WAS

03:11:04.953 --> 03:11:07.255
ABLE TO ASSESS THE FAMILIES NEED

03:11:07.322 --> 03:11:09.124
SAW THAT THERE WAS SOME EMOTION

03:11:09.191 --> 03:11:10.759
THE SO THEY NEED TO BE CONNECTED

03:11:10.826 --> 03:11:11.927
TO MENTAL HEALTH.

03:11:11.993 --> 03:11:13.428
MOM WAS CRYING AND STRUGGLING

03:11:13.495 --> 03:11:20.268
WITH THE TEEN TEEN ALSO

03:11:20.335 --> 03:11:21.269
STRUGGLING.

03:11:21.336 --> 03:11:22.337
SO I WAS ABLE TO CONNECT THEM

03:11:22.404 --> 03:11:23.438
ALSO I WAS ABLE TO LOOK AT THE

03:11:23.505 --> 03:11:25.273
THE METER FOR THE BLOOD SUGARS

03:11:25.340 --> 03:11:26.474
AND NOTICED THAT THE CHILD HAD.

03:11:26.541 --> 03:11:27.108
SEVERE HIGHS CONTINUOUSLY FROM

03:11:27.175 --> 03:11:29.277
MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED TO

03:11:29.344 --> 03:11:29.878
SIXTEEN HUNDRED CELLS ABLE TO

03:11:29.945 --> 03:11:31.313
SHOW THAT THAT FAMILY THAT IF

03:11:31.379 --> 03:11:33.081
THEY GO ON CHECK AT THE INSULIN

03:11:33.148 --> 03:11:34.649
IF THE BLOOD SUGAR IS UNCHECKED

03:11:34.716 --> 03:11:35.817
AND NOT COVER.

03:11:35.884 --> 03:11:37.085
THE NO CHILD THE BLOOD SUGAR

03:11:37.152 --> 03:11:38.753
WILL KEEP GOING UP IN THE CHAO

03:11:38.820 --> 03:11:39.988
COULD POSSIBLY DIE.

03:11:40.055 --> 03:11:41.990
SO WHAT DO TO MY DILIGENCE I

03:11:42.057 --> 03:11:44.392
RECOMMENDED THAT THE FAMILY ALSO

03:11:44.459 --> 03:11:46.728
GO BACK INTO THE ENDOCRINOLOGIST

03:11:46.795 --> 03:11:49.030
TO BE RETESTED ON HOW TO MANAGE

03:11:49.097 --> 03:11:51.399
THE DIABETES REGIMENT WHICH IS

03:11:51.466 --> 03:11:53.268
STILL SO IMPORTANT.

03:11:53.335 --> 03:11:56.271
ALSO OF THAT IMPACT IF WE WERE

03:11:56.338 --> 03:11:59.140
IF I WAS ABLE TO GO IN SOONER.

03:11:59.207 --> 03:12:01.042
LIKE THE ONE WITH THE TRICK

03:12:01.109 --> 03:12:02.444
THEY'RE NOT PREVENTED THE CHILD

03:12:02.510 --> 03:12:04.446
FROM BEING DETAINED AND KEPT THE

03:12:04.512 --> 03:12:06.014
CHILD IN THE HOME WITH THE

DIABETIC PATIENTS.

03:12:07.482 --> 03:12:08.984
I WAS ABLE TO SO FAR KEEP THE

03:12:09.050 --> 03:12:10.619
CHILD IN THE HOME DUE TO THE

03:12:10.685 --> 03:12:12.320
SERVICE CONNECTIONS AND THEN

03:12:12.387 --> 03:12:15.190
ALSO TO DO A FOLLOW UP VISIT. TO

03:12:15.257 --> 03:12:16.591
MAKE SURE EVERYTHING THAT I HAD

03:12:16.658 --> 03:12:17.993
SUGGESTED IN RECOMMENDED THAT IS

03:12:18.059 --> 03:12:19.794
IN PLACE AND THAT THEY ARE

03:12:19.861 --> 03:12:20.896

WILL MAKE THAT DETERMINATION AT

03:12:28.169 --> 03:12:30.672
THAT TIME. TO PREVENT THE CHILD

03:12:30.739 --> 03:12:31.640
FROM BEING REMOVED FROM THE HOME

03:12:31.706 --> 03:12:32.207
WE LIKE TO KEEP THE FAMILIES

03:12:32.274 --> 03:12:32.474
TOGETHER.

03:12:32.540 --> 03:12:33.508

WE TALKING TO THE FOSTER YOUTH

03:13:56.658 --> 03:13:57.892
THAT'S IMPORTANT OVER TALKING TO

03:13:57.959 --> 03:13:58.727
PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY DOING

03:13:58.793 --> 03:14:00.562

QUESTIONS Y. LA COUNTY WHY SO

03:14:07.335 --> 03:14:08.536

OF ALL THE CASELOAD FOR THE

03:14:13.341 --> 03:14:14.342
STATE OF CALLAHAN'S A LITTLE BIT

03:14:14.409 --> 03:14:16.111
THERE'S SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND

03:14:16.177 --> 03:14:17.946
FOSTER YOUTH IN CALIFORNIA ALONE

03:14:18.013 --> 03:14:20.482
AND LA COUNTY HAS.

03:14:20.548 --> 03:14:21.416
TWENTY THOUSAND SO WE'RE HUGE

03:14:21.483 --> 03:14:22.851
COUNTY YES YOU ARE -- IF WE

03:14:22.917 --> 03:14:26.554
COULD GET THE PILOT GOING IN AND

03:14:26.621 --> 03:14:27.655
THEN EVENTUALLY IF I COULD TO

03:14:27.722 --> 03:14:32.394
ONLY DISCREDIT STATEWIDE

03:14:32.460 --> 03:14:35.063
ABSOLUTE ALL RIGHT.

03:14:35.130 --> 03:14:36.297
ALL RIGHT SEVEN GET OR OR LOOK

03:14:36.364 --> 03:14:38.933
AT SOME TYPE OF PILOT PROGRAM --

03:14:39.000 --> 03:14:41.469
IN BOTH AREAS I THINK ON A ON A

03:14:41.536 --> 03:14:43.972
DIFFERENT SCALES.

03:14:44.039 --> 03:14:47.208
SINCE WE'RE THE ONLY ONES LEFT.

03:14:47.275 --> 03:14:49.411
RIGHT NOW YEAH YOU KNOW.

03:14:49.477 --> 03:14:50.945
YOU KNOW COUNTY REMAINS THE

03:14:51.012 --> 03:14:52.347
LARGEST COUNTY WITH WITH THE

03:14:52.414 --> 03:14:53.214
GREAT GREAT NEED THIS OVERLOOKED

03:14:53.281 --> 03:14:53.882
ALSO COUNTY AND WE HAVE MULTIPLE

03:14:53.948 --> 03:14:54.949
COMPLEXES BECAUSE WE HAVE THE

03:14:55.016 --> 03:14:56.351
SOCIAL ECONOMICS AND ALSO

03:14:56.418 --> 03:14:56.851
THEY'RE NOT.

03:14:56.918 --> 03:14:58.520
ALWAYS EDUCATED A LOT ON THE

03:14:58.586 --> 03:15:00.088
BELOW SIX GRADE LEVEL SO THERE'S

03:15:00.155 --> 03:15:02.524
A LOT OF EXTRA THINGS THAT WE

03:15:02.590 --> 03:15:03.158
HAD TO DO AN AUDIT TAKE CARE OF

03:15:03.224 --> 03:15:04.592
OUR ANOTHER REASON WHY SHOULD BE

03:15:04.659 --> 03:15:08.029
A PILOT PROGRAM IN BOTH COUNTIES.

03:15:08.096 --> 03:15:10.165
IS BECAUSE A LOT OF THE MEMBERS

03:15:10.231 --> 03:15:12.467
AND CLIENTS TO DO -- TRAVEL ON

03:15:12.534 --> 03:15:14.102
BECAUSE IT'S SO CLOSE FROM LA

03:15:14.169 --> 03:15:15.036
COUNTY IN DECEMBER YOU KNOW

03:15:15.103 --> 03:15:16.738
COUNTY SO IT COULD BE SERVING

03:15:16.805 --> 03:15:18.573
THE SAME FOLDED STARED JUST A A

03:15:18.640 --> 03:15:19.707
FOOD FOR THOUGHT.

03:15:19.774 --> 03:15:20.775
AND IF WE KEEP TALKING WILL

03:15:20.842 --> 03:15:21.976
DAVID GIVE YOU EVER REASON

03:15:22.043 --> 03:15:23.144
POSSIBLE.

03:15:23.211 --> 03:15:28.550
THE HOUSING IS LESS EXPENSIVE SO

03:15:28.616 --> 03:15:31.252
WE KNOW THAT.

03:15:31.319 --> 03:15:32.253
THAT LA COUNTY HI THAT'S RIGHT

03:15:32.320 --> 03:15:32.887
THAT'S RIGHT BUT THE POPULATION

03:15:32.954 --> 03:15:34.022
DOES CONTINUE.

03:15:34.089 --> 03:15:35.323
TO MOVE DOESN'T SEE COUNTY LINES

03:15:35.390 --> 03:15:37.826
IT SEES THE NEED GOING.

03:15:37.892 --> 03:15:39.194
AND EVERYWHERE THIS NEED IT SO

03:15:39.260 --> 03:15:40.361
WE WOULD -- AVIC OUR IN OUR

WE GOT TO GET WATER LA FOR FOR

03:15:46.734 --> 03:15:47.802

03:15:50.839 --> 03:15:52.240
THE FOSTER USE.

03:15:52.307 --> 03:15:54.209
IF WE CAN GET THAT PILOT GOING

03:15:54.275 --> 03:15:55.710

YOU'LL PROBABLY BE HAPPY ABOUT

03:16:01.349 --> 03:16:01.883
THAT BECAUSE YOU WON'T HAVE TO

03:16:01.950 --> 03:16:02.684

03:17:24.999 --> 03:17:26.534
BASED ON WHAT WE SAW WITH THE

03:17:26.601 --> 03:17:27.835
GROWING CONCERN IN CALIFORNIA

03:17:27.902 --> 03:17:29.304
OVER THE LINK BETWEEN CHILD

HOMELESSNESS AMONG FAMILIES.

AND MORE HOMELESSNESS BUT CAN

03:17:40.615 --> 03:17:42.083
NOT IN AND OF ITSELF BE A BASIS

03:17:42.150 --> 03:17:44.152
FOR REMOVAL THERE'S ABSOLUTELY A

03:17:44.219 --> 03:17:46.721
LINK BETWEEN REFERRALS TO CPS.

03:17:46.788 --> 03:17:48.056
AND HOMELESSNESS.

03:17:48.122 --> 03:17:49.591
AND EVEN MORE COMMON FAMILIES

03:17:49.657 --> 03:17:51.359

REUNIFY WE KNOW ARE NOT BEING

03:17:55.396 --> 03:17:56.965
REUNIFIED BECAUSE JUDGES ARE

03:17:57.031 --> 03:17:59.734
LOATH. TO REUNIFY CHILDREN TO

THE STREETS.

03:18:01.035 --> 03:18:02.370
I'M IN SO WE LITERALLY HAVE A

03:18:02.437 --> 03:18:03.671
SITUATION WHERE THEIR CHILDREN

03:18:03.738 --> 03:18:04.973
IN FOSTER CARE FOR NO OTHER

03:18:05.039 --> 03:18:05.907
REASON.

03:18:05.974 --> 03:18:07.141
BUT FOR THE FACT THAT THEIR

03:18:07.208 --> 03:18:09.210
PARENTS CAN'T FIND SAFE AND

03:18:09.277 --> 03:18:10.612

EXISTING CHILD WELFARE TRAINING

THOUSAND ELEVEN REALIGNMENT AND

03:23:45.880 --> 03:23:46.581

TRAINING WITH ONE OF THEM.

03:23:54.288 --> 03:23:55.890
THE BELIEF AT THE TIME AND I

03:23:55.957 --> 03:23:56.524
THINK IT'S THOUGH IF IT'S THE

03:23:56.591 --> 03:23:58.125
RIGHT BELIEF WAS THAT FOR

03:23:58.192 --> 03:24:00.528
PURPOSES OF ENSURING CONSISTENCY.

03:24:00.595 --> 03:24:02.930
AND ACHIEVING ECONOMIES OF SCALE

03:24:02.997 --> 03:24:04.498
THAT THE STATE SHOULD BE THE

03:24:04.565 --> 03:24:05.299
PROVIDER OF TRAINING IN THE

03:24:05.366 --> 03:24:07.368
STATE HAS A ROBUST

03:24:07.435 --> 03:24:08.636
INFRASTRUCTURE.

03:24:14.108 --> 03:24:14.675
THE TRAINING WITH CAP WITH THE

03:24:14.742 --> 03:24:15.509
STATE.

03:24:15.576 --> 03:24:17.778
UNFORTUNATELY THAT FUNDING FOR

03:24:17.845 --> 03:24:20.114
STATE TRAINING HAS NOT KEPT PACE

03:24:20.181 --> 03:24:21.983
WITH THE MAJOR CHANGES IN THE

03:24:22.049 --> 03:24:23.584

03:24:33.361 --> 03:24:34.328
FEDERALLY REQUIRED PROGRAM

03:24:34.395 --> 03:24:36.397
IMPROVEMENT PLAN THAT REQUIRES

03:24:36.464 --> 03:24:37.865
THAT WE IMPROVE OUR PRACTICE AND

03:24:37.932 --> 03:24:39.300
ONE OF THE METHODOLOGIES FOR

03:24:39.367 --> 03:24:40.601
DOING THAT.

03:24:40.668 --> 03:24:42.637
IS IS BETTER TRAINING -- SO

03:24:42.703 --> 03:24:44.672

03:24:44.739 --> 03:24:47.041
ENHANCE THE TRAINING AND AND IT

03:24:47.108 --> 03:24:48.976

03:25:03.057 --> 03:25:03.591
MORE TRAINING FOR THE REASONS

03:25:03.658 --> 03:25:04.825
THAT I'VE MENTIONED BUT ALSO

03:25:04.892 --> 03:25:06.727
SOME OTHER ENHANCEMENTS TRAINING

03:25:06.794 --> 03:25:08.429
OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM LIKE

03:25:08.496 --> 03:25:09.997

MODALITIES OF LEARNING.

TRAINING FOR SUPERVISORS BECAUSE

03:25:13.434 --> 03:25:14.735
WE ALL KNOW THAT SUPERVISION IS

03:25:14.802 --> 03:25:17.471
AS IMPORTANT. TO OUTCOMES AS AS

03:25:17.538 --> 03:25:19.273
THE WORK OF THE LINE -- CASE

03:25:19.340 --> 03:25:20.141
