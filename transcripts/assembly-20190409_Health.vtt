01:09:10.613 --> 01:09:11.413
THE THOUGHT THAT THE SUPER

01:09:12.915 --> 01:09:14.316
BANNED AS A FORM OF COUPONING

01:09:14.383 --> 01:09:16.519

01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:40.142
SO AT THE SAME TIME OBESITY

01:09:40.209 --> 01:09:42.044
PREVALENCE FOR ADULTS INCREASED

01:09:42.111 --> 01:09:45.014
BY 30% AND YOUTH BY 33% WE'RE

01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:46.482

01:09:47.483 --> 01:09:48.684
WERE SIMPLY COMING IN ARGUING

01:09:48.751 --> 01:09:51.420
THAT SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES

01:09:51.487 --> 01:09:52.688
ALONE OR NOT THE DRIVER OF THIS.

01:09:52.755 --> 01:09:54.590
TODAY IN FACT AND THIS IS AGAIN

01:09:54.657 --> 01:09:56.125
FROM THE RETAILER PERSPECTIVE

01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:57.693

THE DISCOUNTS HAD TO BE BANNED

01:10:07.670 --> 01:10:08.704
THEN WHY AREN'T WE SEEING A

01:10:08.771 --> 01:10:09.972
REVERSAL ON THESE NUMBERS

01:10:10.039 --> 01:10:11.807

01:17:18.166 --> 01:17:19.935
CONSUMPTION MAY BE DECLINING --

01:17:20.002 --> 01:17:22.137
IN SOME FORMS -- BUT THAT NUMBER

01:18:00.742 --> 01:18:02.611
ELASTIC THAT WHEN PRICES -- GO

01:18:02.677 --> 01:18:05.280
DOWN CONSUMPTION GOES UP.

01:18:05.347 --> 01:18:06.515

CONSUMPTION -- GOES DOWN.

01:18:09.751 --> 01:18:11.887

THE HUMAN TOLL OF THIS HEALTH

01:25:05.667 --> 01:25:06.768

COMMUNITIES.

01:25:13.541 --> 01:25:15.109
AND THE ECONOMIC IMPACT IS NO

01:25:15.176 --> 01:25:16.277
SMALL MATTER.

01:25:16.344 --> 01:25:18.780
DIABETES ALONE COST THE STATE AN

01:25:18.847 --> 01:25:21.416

01:25:25.019 --> 01:25:26.888
IS DRIVING UP SYSTEM WIDE HEALTH

01:25:26.955 --> 01:25:28.156

01:25:42.303 --> 01:25:44.172
AS DAUNTING AS THE HEALTH CRISIS

01:25:44.239 --> 01:25:45.273
IS TODAY WE HAVE AN

AND AGAIN.

01:25:51.846 --> 01:25:53.348
LET ME REPEAT THE SCIENCES

01:25:53.414 --> 01:25:54.849
OVERWHELMING.

01:25:54.916 --> 01:25:56.351
SUGARY DRINKS HAVE PLAYED A

01:25:56.417 --> 01:25:58.353
UNIQUE ROLE IN DRIVING THE

01:25:58.419 --> 01:26:00.255
HEALTH EPIDEMIC THAT WE FACE

01:26:00.321 --> 01:26:01.122
TODAY.

01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:02.857
THEY ARE THE SINGLE LARGEST

01:26:02.924 --> 01:26:04.492
SOURCE OF ADDED SUGAR IN THE

01:26:04.559 --> 01:26:05.994
AMERICAN DIET.

01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:07.428
AND LEAD TO INCREASED RISK OF

01:26:07.495 --> 01:26:09.297
DIABETES HEART DISEASE LIVER

01:26:09.364 --> 01:26:12.000

AND EVEN SOME CANCERS.

01:26:14.402 --> 01:26:15.403
AND NO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT

01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:18.273
CALORIES SUGARY DRINKS ARE

01:26:18.339 --> 01:26:20.141
UNIQUELY ON HEALTHY.

01:26:20.208 --> 01:26:21.442
THEY ARE EMPTY CALORIES THAT ARE

01:26:21.509 --> 01:26:23.077
METABOLIZED QUICKLY IN A WAY

01:26:23.144 --> 01:26:25.613
THAT CAN OVERWHELM THE PANCREAS

01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:27.081
AND LEAD TO THE KIND OF WEIGHT

01:26:27.148 --> 01:26:28.850
GAIN THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH

01:26:28.917 --> 01:26:30.418
CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE.

01:26:30.485 --> 01:26:32.086
AS WELL AS PROSTATE AND BREAST

01:26:32.153 --> 01:26:33.721
CANCER.

01:26:33.788 --> 01:26:35.423
ABOUT HALF OF ADULTS IN TWO

01:26:35.490 --> 01:26:37.292
THIRDS OF YOUTH CONSUMER SUGARY

01:26:37.358 --> 01:26:37.492
DRINK.

01:26:37.559 --> 01:26:39.427
EVERY DAY.

01:26:39.494 --> 01:26:42.463
ON AVERAGE CHILDREN CONSUME OVER

01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:44.532
THIRTY GALLONS OF SUGARY DRINKS

01:26:44.599 --> 01:26:46.234
EVERY YEAR THAT'S ENOUGH TO FILL

01:26:46.301 --> 01:26:48.002
A BATH TUB.

01:26:48.069 --> 01:26:49.437
AND SO HERE WE ARE WITH THE

01:26:49.504 --> 01:26:50.438
HEALTH CRISIS.

01:26:50.505 --> 01:26:52.407
AND LITTLE TO NO PREVENTION

01:26:52.473 --> 01:26:53.308
FUNDING.

01:26:53.374 --> 01:26:54.776
AND WITH THE PRODUCT IN AN

01:26:54.842 --> 01:26:56.244
INDUSTRY THAT IS.

01:26:56.311 --> 01:26:57.979
TRULY.

01:26:58.046 --> 01:26:59.514
A UNIQUE AND THAT'S WHERE.

01:26:59.581 --> 01:27:02.350
MY BILL COMES IN AB ONE THIRTY

01:27:02.417 --> 01:27:04.018
EIGHT PROPOSES TO LEVY A TWO

01:27:04.085 --> 01:27:05.987
CENT PER OUNCE.

01:27:06.054 --> 01:27:08.056
UGH UGH THAT FLUID OUNCE.

01:27:08.122 --> 01:27:10.191
TAX ON SUGARY DRINKS THE REVENUE

01:27:10.258 --> 01:27:11.626
OF WHICH WOULD BE USED TO

01:27:11.693 --> 01:27:12.894
CONFRONT THESE NEGATIVE HEALTH

01:27:12.961 --> 01:27:14.395
IMPACTS HAD ON THROUGH

01:27:14.462 --> 01:27:16.097
PREVENTION PROGRAMS AND

01:27:16.164 --> 01:27:17.832
PARTICULARLY IN THE COMMUNITIES

01:27:17.899 --> 01:27:19.033
THAT ARE HARSH HARDEST HIT BY

01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:21.402
THE DIABETES.

01:27:21.469 --> 01:27:23.037
AND OBESITY EPIDEMICS.

01:27:23.104 --> 01:27:25.006
THIS PROPOSAL IS DESIGNED TO DO

01:27:25.073 --> 01:27:27.375
TWO THINGS FIRST REDUCE

01:27:27.442 --> 01:27:28.910
CONSUMPTION ANDSECOND.

01:27:28.977 --> 01:27:30.478
RAISE THE FUNDING NEEDED TO

01:27:30.545 --> 01:27:33.081
EDUCATE AND EMPOWER CALIFORNIANS

01:27:33.147 --> 01:27:35.416
TO LIVE HEALTHIER LIVES A GOAL I

01:27:35.483 --> 01:27:37.018
THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE ON THIS

01:27:37.085 --> 01:27:39.354
BILL HOLDS IMMENSE POTENTIAL TO

01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:40.855
COUNTERACT THE ALARMING HEALTH

01:27:40.922 --> 01:27:42.323
TRENDS THAT WE'VE WITNESS.

01:27:42.390 --> 01:27:43.658
CITIES AROUND THE U. S. AND

01:27:43.725 --> 01:27:45.093
COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD HAVE

01:27:45.159 --> 01:27:46.260
ALREADY PASSED THEIR OWN SUGARY

01:27:46.327 --> 01:27:48.196
DRINK TAXES WHO WOULDN'T BE

01:27:48.262 --> 01:27:49.163
FIRST IN THIS.

01:27:49.230 --> 01:27:50.965
AND THEY'VE SEEN POSITIVE

01:27:51.032 --> 01:27:53.501
RESULTS NEARBY A FEE BY A FEE

01:27:53.568 --> 01:27:55.303
AND BERKELEY REDUCE CONSUMPTION

01:27:55.370 --> 01:27:57.905
BY ALMOST 10% OVERALL.

01:27:57.972 --> 01:27:59.907
AND 21% IN LOW INCOME

01:27:59.974 --> 01:28:02.610
NEIGHBORHOODS AND THAT'S JUST

01:28:02.677 --> 01:28:03.845
WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR.

01:28:03.911 --> 01:28:05.713
CONSUMPTION OF TAP AND BOTTLED

01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:09.784
WATER INCREASED BY AN ESTIMATED

01:28:09.851 --> 01:28:10.985
63%.

01:28:11.052 --> 01:28:13.121
IN MEXICO A SUGARY DRINK TAX

01:28:13.187 --> 01:28:16.624
REDUCE PURCHASES OF THESE -- BY

01:28:16.691 --> 01:28:19.093
FIVE POINT 5% IN THE FIRST YEAR

01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:21.462
AND NINE POINT 7% IN THE SECOND

01:28:21.529 --> 01:28:22.597
YEAR.

01:28:22.664 --> 01:28:23.698
IN ADDITION TO REDUCING

01:28:23.765 --> 01:28:25.366
CONSUMPTION.

01:28:25.433 --> 01:28:26.534
REVENUES WERE HELP FUND

01:28:26.601 --> 01:28:29.303
IMPORTANT PREVENTION PROGRAMS.

01:28:29.370 --> 01:28:31.172
EVERYTHING FROM SCHOOL NURSES TO

01:28:34.075 --> 01:28:36.244
AND ACCESS TO SAFE.

01:28:36.310 --> 01:28:38.046
AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER

01:28:38.112 --> 01:28:39.714
AND I'D LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY

01:28:39.781 --> 01:28:42.050

THAT TOPIC AFFORDABLE DRINKING

WATER.

01:28:46.954 --> 01:28:48.623
AND I WANT YOU ALL TO KNOW THAT

01:28:48.690 --> 01:28:50.558
I'M COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT A

SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE FUNDS

01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:54.195
ARE DEDICATED TO THE SAFE

DRINKING WATER SUPPLEMENTAL

01:28:56.097 --> 01:28:57.565
BENEFITS PILOT PROGRAM.

01:28:57.632 --> 01:28:58.833
WHICH WILL HELP CONFERENCE

01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:01.736
RECIPIENTS AFFORDABLY ACCESS

01:29:01.803 --> 01:29:04.172
DRINKING WATER [inaudible]

01:29:04.238 --> 01:29:06.107
CALIFORNIA'S INACTION ON THE

01:29:06.174 --> 01:29:07.675
SEWERS ISSUE IS NO LONGER

01:29:07.742 --> 01:29:09.844
EXCUSABLE ESPECIALLY BECAUSE

01:29:09.911 --> 01:29:12.180
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN NO LONGER

01:29:12.246 --> 01:29:13.648
PASSED THEIR OWN ORDINANCES.

01:29:13.715 --> 01:29:15.416
A POLICY THAT THE AMERICAN

01:29:15.483 --> 01:29:18.086
BEVERAGE INDUSTRY FOUGHT.

01:29:18.152 --> 01:29:19.387
FOR AND AS YOU ALL REMEMBER

01:29:19.454 --> 01:29:20.855
STRONG ARMED THROUGH THIS

01:29:20.922 --> 01:29:24.692
LEGISLATURE IN THE LAST SESSION.

01:29:24.759 --> 01:29:26.594
I'D LIKE TO CLOSE BY ADDRESSING

01:29:26.661 --> 01:29:28.229
SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE

01:29:28.296 --> 01:29:29.731
BEEN RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION.

01:29:29.797 --> 01:29:32.300
THE FIRST IS THAT SIN TAXES

01:29:32.366 --> 01:29:33.835
DON'T ACTUALLY CHANGE BEHAVIOR

01:29:33.901 --> 01:29:35.837
AND WE KNOW THAT THAT IS

01:29:35.903 --> 01:29:38.606
DEMONSTRABLY FALSE.

01:29:38.673 --> 01:29:40.775
WE HAVE DECADES OF EVIDENCE FROM

01:29:40.842 --> 01:29:43.144
TOBACCO TAXES THAT HAVE SHOWN

01:29:43.211 --> 01:29:44.846
THEIR EFFECTIVENESS AT REDUCING

01:29:44.912 --> 01:29:47.949
TOBACCO USE AND IMPROVING HEALTH

01:29:48.015 --> 01:29:49.417
OUT OUTCOMES.

01:29:49.484 --> 01:29:50.985
AS I AS I MENTIONED WE ALSO HAVE

01:29:51.052 --> 01:29:52.320
IT OF EVIDENCE FROM OTHER

01:29:52.386 --> 01:29:53.488
JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE PASSED

01:29:53.554 --> 01:29:55.923
THEIR OWN SUGARY DRINK TAXES.

01:29:55.990 --> 01:29:56.791
AND I'D LIKE TO REMIND THE

01:29:56.858 --> 01:29:58.559
COMMITTEE THAT IMMEDIATE

01:29:58.626 --> 01:30:00.595
REDUCTION IN CONSUMPTION IS ONLY

01:30:00.661 --> 01:30:02.964
PART OF THE BILL'S GOAL THE

01:30:03.030 --> 01:30:06.434
SECOND LONG TERM GOAL.

01:30:06.501 --> 01:30:08.469
WHICH IS EQUALLY IF NOT MORE

01:30:08.536 --> 01:30:10.271
IMPORTANT IS TO CREATE A

01:30:10.338 --> 01:30:12.740
DEDICATED FUNDING SOURCE FOR

01:30:12.807 --> 01:30:14.475
PREVENTION PROGRAMS.

01:30:14.542 --> 01:30:15.643
ANOTHER CONCERN THAT HAS BEEN

01:30:15.710 --> 01:30:17.211
RAISED BY OPPOSITION IS THAT THE

01:30:17.278 --> 01:30:19.547
BILL WOULD NOT ACTUALLY HAVE

01:30:19.614 --> 01:30:20.982
POSITIVE OUTCOMES.

01:30:21.048 --> 01:30:22.817
AS MUCH AS WE LOVE INSTANT

01:30:22.884 --> 01:30:24.719
GRATIFICATION TRANSFORMING

01:30:24.786 --> 01:30:27.555
HEALTH OUTCOMES DOES TAKE TIME.

01:30:27.622 --> 01:30:28.956
AND WE KNOW THAT SUGARY DRINK

01:30:29.023 --> 01:30:31.025
TAXES REDUCE CONSUMPTION AND WE

01:30:31.092 --> 01:30:33.094
ALSO HAVE A LITANY OF HEALTH

01:30:33.161 --> 01:30:34.796
PROGRAMS THAT WE KNOW ARE

01:30:34.862 --> 01:30:36.364
EFFECTIVE.

01:30:36.430 --> 01:30:39.200
IF WE COULD JUST FUND THE AND OF

01:30:39.267 --> 01:30:41.269
COURSE WE HAVE THE TOBACCO TAX

01:30:41.335 --> 01:30:43.805
EXAMPLE THAT HAS OVER TIME

01:30:43.871 --> 01:30:46.674
DEMONSTRABLY AFFECTED THE HEALTH

01:30:46.741 --> 01:30:48.876
OF CALIFORNIANS OF AMERICANS OF

01:30:48.943 --> 01:30:50.344
PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD. FOR THE

01:30:50.411 --> 01:30:52.513
BETTER.

01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:54.148
THE COALITION OPPOSE LETTER IN

01:30:54.215 --> 01:30:55.883
ARGUING IT'S POINTS LINKS TO THE

01:30:55.950 --> 01:30:57.718
HEARTLAND INSTITUTE.

01:30:57.785 --> 01:30:59.320
A THINK TANK KNOWN FOR ITS

01:30:59.387 --> 01:31:01.622
PARTNERSHIP WITH PHILIP MORRIS

01:31:01.689 --> 01:31:04.125
TO UNDERMINE TOBACCO TAXES.

01:31:04.192 --> 01:31:05.793
AND AS WELL IT'S CLIMATE DENIAL

01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:07.628
RESEARCH.

01:31:07.695 --> 01:31:09.096
BACKING FOR THE COALITION'S

01:31:09.163 --> 01:31:10.631
CLAIMS ALSO COMES FROM

01:31:10.698 --> 01:31:11.899
RESEARCHERS AT THE AMERICAN

01:31:11.966 --> 01:31:14.602
COUNCIL ON SCIENCE AND HEALTH

01:31:14.669 --> 01:31:15.937
WHICH IS AN INDUSTRY FUNDED

01:31:16.003 --> 01:31:17.271
SCIENCE GROUP.

01:31:17.338 --> 01:31:19.774
THAT ADVOCATES AGAINST CHEMICAL

01:31:19.841 --> 01:31:21.442
AND HEALTH REGULATIONS AMONG

01:31:21.509 --> 01:31:23.477
OTHER THINGS.

01:31:23.544 --> 01:31:24.846
FINALLY THOUGH THE INDUSTRY

01:31:24.912 --> 01:31:27.148
ARGUES THAT THE COULD BE JOBS

01:31:27.215 --> 01:31:29.417
AND ECONOMIC IMPACT -- NUMEROUS

01:31:29.483 --> 01:31:31.118
STUDIES FROM BERKELEY AND FROM

01:31:31.185 --> 01:31:33.120
PHILADELPHIA HAVE SHOWN THAT

01:31:33.187 --> 01:31:34.789
THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY THE CASE

01:31:34.856 --> 01:31:36.657
THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN.

01:31:36.724 --> 01:31:38.593
I'D ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT

01:31:38.659 --> 01:31:40.461
THERE ARE A ARE IMMENSE COSTS TO

01:31:40.528 --> 01:31:42.230
OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IF WE

01:31:42.296 --> 01:31:45.266
LEAVE THIS CRISIS UNCHECKED.

01:31:45.333 --> 01:31:47.835
AND THINK ABOUT THE QUALITY OF

01:31:47.902 --> 01:31:50.438
LIFE FOR PEOPLE THAT WE ALL KNOW

01:31:50.504 --> 01:31:53.441
WHO ARE AFFECTED BY THE DISEASES

01:31:53.507 --> 01:31:56.444
THAT I HAVE MENTIONED.

01:31:56.510 --> 01:31:58.579
THAT DOESN'T HAVE A PRICE TAG

01:31:58.646 --> 01:31:59.513
AND YET.

01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:03.117
WE CAN EXPECT IMPROVEMENTS IF WE

01:32:03.184 --> 01:32:04.886
MOVE FORWARD ON THIS INITIATIVE.

01:32:04.952 --> 01:32:06.654
OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS WE HAVE

01:32:06.721 --> 01:32:08.923
SEEN STUDY AFTER STUDY THAT

01:32:08.990 --> 01:32:10.591
CONFIRMS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN

01:32:10.658 --> 01:32:12.927
SUGARY DRINKS AND I'D BE THIS.

01:32:12.994 --> 01:32:15.663
THE SCIENCE IS QUITE CLEAR.

01:32:15.730 --> 01:32:17.164
WE'VE WITNESSED LANCS THE

01:32:17.231 --> 01:32:19.033
INDUSTRY WILL GO TO TO PROFIT

01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:21.702
CONSUMERS EXPENSE MUCH LIKE BIG

01:32:21.769 --> 01:32:24.005
TOBACCO DID INCLUDING MISLEADING

01:32:24.071 --> 01:32:25.306
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES.

01:32:25.373 --> 01:32:27.008

01:32:29.043 --> 01:32:30.344
COLOR.

01:32:30.411 --> 01:32:31.579
SUPPORT HAS GROWN IN THE PUBLIC

01:32:31.646 --> 01:32:32.947
HEALTH AND MEDICAL COMMUNITIES

IN RESPONSE TO BOTH THE

01:32:34.148 --> 01:32:35.983
SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE WHICH IS

01:32:36.050 --> 01:32:37.184
COPIOUS.

01:32:37.251 --> 01:32:38.419
AND THE RESULTS FROM OTHER

01:32:38.486 --> 01:32:41.155
SUGARY DRINK DRINK TAXES.

01:32:41.222 --> 01:32:44.225
IT IS NOW TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO

01:32:44.292 --> 01:32:47.428
STEP UP AND DO ITS PART.

AS PEDIATRICIANS EVERY DAY MY

01:33:47.188 --> 01:33:48.122
COLLEAGUES AND I SEE CHILDREN

01:33:48.189 --> 01:33:50.224
HARMED BY SUGARY DRINKS FROM THE

01:33:50.291 --> 01:33:51.659
TEAM THAT'S DIAGNOSED WITH TYPE

01:33:51.726 --> 01:33:53.561
TWO DIABETES TO THE TODDLER RT

01:33:53.627 --> 01:33:54.795
SHOWING SIGNS OF FATTY LIVER

01:33:54.862 --> 01:33:55.863
DISEASE.

01:33:55.930 --> 01:33:57.298
A DIFFICULT CHILD IS MENTIONED

01:33:57.365 --> 01:33:59.600
CONSUMES OVER THIRTY GALLONS OF

01:33:59.667 --> 01:34:01.202
SUGARY DRINKS EVERY YEAR CURRENT

01:34:01.268 --> 01:34:03.170
DIETARY GUIDELINES RECOMMEND

01:34:03.237 --> 01:34:04.372
THAT CHILDREN AND TEENS CONSUME

01:34:04.438 --> 01:34:07.074
FEWER THAN 10% OF CALORIES FROM

01:34:07.141 --> 01:34:07.942
ADDED SUGARS.

01:34:08.009 --> 01:34:09.343
BUT DATA SHOWS THAT THE NOW

01:34:09.410 --> 01:34:10.678
CONSUME NEARLY DOUBLE THAT

01:34:10.745 --> 01:34:12.046
RECOMMENDED LET ME AND MORE THAN

01:34:12.113 --> 01:34:14.115
HALF OF IT COMING FROM SUGARY

01:34:14.181 --> 01:34:14.715
DRINKS.

01:34:14.782 --> 01:34:16.283
WHILE INDIVIDUAL CHOICES IN

01:34:16.350 --> 01:34:16.784
CREATING A HEALTHY HOME

01:34:16.851 --> 01:34:17.952
ENVIRONMENT ARE CRITICALLY

01:34:18.019 --> 01:34:20.421
IMPORTANT THEY ARE NOT ENOUGH

01:34:20.488 --> 01:34:21.622
AND WE'VE SEEN THAT.

01:34:21.689 --> 01:34:23.290
PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY APPROACHES

01:34:23.357 --> 01:34:24.792
WERE NECESSARY TO CURB TOBACCO

01:34:24.859 --> 01:34:26.360
AND ALCOHOL USE AND WE NEED

01:34:26.427 --> 01:34:28.062
SIMILAR INITIATIVES TO REDUCE

01:34:28.129 --> 01:34:28.996
SUGARY TRIP AND DRINK

01:34:29.063 --> 01:34:31.198
CONSUMPTION IN CHILDREN AND

01:34:31.265 --> 01:34:33.200
ADOLESCENTS.

01:34:33.267 --> 01:34:34.969
AS TOBACCO TAXES INCREASED IT'S

01:34:35.036 --> 01:34:36.270
A GREAT USED DROP PRECIPITOUSLY

01:34:36.337 --> 01:34:38.239
ALCOHOL TAXES REDUCE EXCESS

01:34:38.305 --> 01:34:40.741
ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AND ALCOHOL

01:34:40.808 --> 01:34:42.843
ASSOCIATE MOTOR VEHICLE

01:34:42.910 --> 01:34:44.345
AND EXCISE TAXES ON SUGARY

01:34:44.412 --> 01:34:45.880
DRINKS HAVE SUCCESSFULLY REDUCED

01:34:45.946 --> 01:34:47.982
CONSUMPTION IN CITIES LIKE

01:34:48.049 --> 01:34:49.517
BERKELEY AND SAN FRANCISCO.

01:34:49.583 --> 01:34:50.851
STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT SUGARY

01:34:50.918 --> 01:34:51.685
DRINK WOULD BE THE MOST

01:41:54.074 --> 01:41:54.608
FIRST OF ALL WHEN A POINT OUT

01:41:54.675 --> 01:41:55.876
THAT WE MAKE THESE LABELS ABOUT

01:41:55.943 --> 01:41:56.477
SUGARY SWEET BEVERAGES BUT THE

DEFINITIONS KEEP ROTATING FROM

01:41:57.878 --> 01:41:58.178
ONE TO ANOTHER.

01:41:58.245 --> 01:42:01.048
THIS YEAR -- AB ONE THIRTY EIGHT

01:42:01.114 --> 01:42:03.517
HAS A DEFINITION LEVEL FOR

01:42:03.584 --> 01:42:05.752
SERVICE WE BEVERAGE AT TWENTY

01:42:05.819 --> 01:42:06.587
FOUR TWENTY FIVE CALORIES IN A

01:42:06.653 --> 01:42:07.654
TWELVE OUNCE SERVING.

01:42:07.721 --> 01:42:08.989
DIFFERENT THAN IT HAS BEEN IN

01:42:09.056 --> 01:42:10.724
THE PAST WHICH WAS AT SEVENTY

01:42:10.791 --> 01:42:12.092
FIVE CALORIES HUGE DIFFERENCE

01:42:12.159 --> 01:42:13.827
OUR COMPANIES HAVE BEEN WORKING

01:42:13.894 --> 01:42:15.629
OVER SEVERAL YEARS. TO TRY TO

01:42:15.696 --> 01:42:17.865
HAVE MORE INCREASE LOW AND NO

01:42:17.931 --> 01:42:20.067
CALORIE BEVERAGES -- THERE'S A

01:42:20.133 --> 01:42:21.835
TYPICAL SO TO WOULD BE A HUNDRED

01:42:21.902 --> 01:42:24.071
AND FIFTY CALORIES THIS NOW WITH

01:42:24.137 --> 01:42:27.040
CAPTURE SAY ITS HEAT THAT HAS

01:42:27.107 --> 01:42:28.842
FIFTY CALORIES IN IT AND NOW

01:42:28.909 --> 01:42:30.377
WOULD BE TAX ON IT SO WE'RE

01:42:30.444 --> 01:42:32.646
TRYING TO MOVE PEOPLE. TO THOSE

01:42:32.713 --> 01:42:34.414
HEALTHIER OPTIONS HOPEFULLY DOWN

01:42:34.481 --> 01:42:36.383
TO A ZERO OPTION -- THAT IS NOW

01:42:36.450 --> 01:42:39.286
TAX -- OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS

01:42:39.353 --> 01:42:41.088
60% OF OUR NEW BRAND PRODUCTS

01:42:41.154 --> 01:42:43.657
HAVE BEEN LOWER NO CALORIE

01:42:43.724 --> 01:42:44.725
BEVERAGES WHAT ARE STILL SAY

01:42:44.791 --> 01:42:46.760
THAT 50% OF WHAT SOLD UP OUR

01:42:46.827 --> 01:42:48.529
PRODUCT OUR ZERO CALORIE

01:42:48.595 --> 01:42:50.163
PRODUCTS.

01:42:50.230 --> 01:42:51.832
I'M SO THIS WOULD CAPTURING IT --

01:42:51.899 --> 01:42:53.200
MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED A LITTLE

01:42:53.267 --> 01:42:54.701
EARLIER IN THE OF TESTIMONY ON

01:42:54.768 --> 01:42:56.069
THE EARLIER BILL IS THAT

01:42:56.136 --> 01:42:59.306
CONSUMPTION IS DOWN 2526% IN

01:42:59.373 --> 01:43:01.942
ADULTS THIRTY FIVE POINT 9% IN

01:43:02.009 --> 01:43:02.910
USE.

01:43:02.976 --> 01:43:04.378
AND AT THE SAME TIME THE OBESITY

01:43:04.444 --> 01:43:06.780
RATES HAVE GONE UP THIRTY AND

01:43:06.847 --> 01:43:09.016
33% AT THE SAME TIME PERIOD.

01:43:09.082 --> 01:43:11.218
SO OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS

01:43:11.285 --> 01:43:13.587
THE US DOUBT -- CALORIES DIET

01:43:13.654 --> 01:43:15.856
HAS GONE UP FOUR HUNDRED AND

01:43:15.923 --> 01:43:17.090
TWENTY THREE CALORIES SO THE

01:43:17.157 --> 01:43:19.259
AVERAGE PERSON IS CONSUMING MORE

01:43:19.326 --> 01:43:20.894
THAN. FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY THREE

01:43:20.961 --> 01:43:22.563
CALORIES MORE PER DAY THAN THEY

01:43:22.629 --> 01:43:23.730
HAD IN THE PAST.

01:43:23.797 --> 01:43:27.568
MOST OF THAT 38% IS NOT -- IS

01:43:27.634 --> 01:43:30.137
COMING FROM STARCHESSOLD MOST

01:43:30.203 --> 01:43:31.738
OF THOSE EXTRA CALORIES A WE ARE

01:43:31.805 --> 01:43:33.307
CONSUMING IT IS NOT JUST

01:43:33.373 --> 01:43:35.375
CIGARETTES START IN FACT AS WELL

01:43:35.442 --> 01:43:37.177
SO WE ARE INCREASING THE AMOUNT

01:43:37.244 --> 01:43:38.445
OF CALORIES THAT WE ARE

01:43:38.512 --> 01:43:38.979
CONSUMING.

01:43:39.046 --> 01:43:41.248
EVERY DAY EVERYONE LOVES TO TALK

01:43:41.315 --> 01:43:43.650
ABOUT BERKELEY AS A SUCCESS RATE.

01:43:43.717 --> 01:43:46.653
AND BERKELEY DID PASS IN TWO

01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:47.187
THOUSAND FOURTEEN BUT THE

01:43:47.254 --> 01:43:52.659
REALITY OF IT IS IS THAT

01:43:52.726 --> 01:43:54.728
BERKELEY WHEN THE THE COLLEAGUES

01:43:54.795 --> 01:43:56.396
ONLY DID -- THE STUDY THEMSELVES

01:43:56.463 --> 01:43:58.098
IN BERKELEY THEY INDICATED THAT --

01:43:58.165 --> 01:43:59.266
THE CALORIE CONSUMPTION FROM

01:43:59.333 --> 01:44:00.067
SODAS WENT DOWN -- SIX CALORIES

01:44:00.133 --> 01:44:01.068
PER DAY WHICH DOESN'T EVEN

01:44:01.134 --> 01:44:01.668
INDICATING ANY KIND OF WEIGHT

01:44:01.735 --> 01:44:02.903
LOSS BUT THEY STARTED DRINKING

01:44:02.970 --> 01:44:04.671
SMOOTHIES AND SO THEIR CALORIE

01:44:04.738 --> 01:44:06.206
COUNT WENT UP THIRTY TWO

01:44:06.273 --> 01:44:07.307
CALORIES A DAY.

01:44:07.374 --> 01:44:08.976
AND SO BERKELEY ALSO SAYS --

01:44:09.042 --> 01:44:10.577
WE'VE HAD THIS DECREASE BUT

01:44:10.644 --> 01:44:12.346
THERE THERE ARE AMOUNT OF

01:44:12.412 --> 01:44:15.248
REVENUE HAS BEGUN INCREASING AND

01:44:15.315 --> 01:44:16.783
BERKELEY SO IT THAT'S ON

01:44:16.850 --> 01:44:18.752
BERKELEY'S WEBSITE SO IT CAN'T

01:44:18.819 --> 01:44:21.154
BE GOING DOWN AND YOUR REVENUES

01:44:21.221 --> 01:44:22.990
ARE CONTINUING TO GO UP.

01:44:23.056 --> 01:44:24.625
THERE WAS JUST A GATE STUDY BAD

01:44:24.691 --> 01:44:26.259
WAS FUNDED NOT BY OUR INDUSTRY

01:44:26.326 --> 01:44:28.829
BUT THE GATES FAMILY THAT WAS A

01:44:28.895 --> 01:44:29.696
TWENTY SEVEN YEARS WORLD WIDE

01:44:29.763 --> 01:44:32.199
STUDY OF WHAT WE'RE CONSUMING.

01:44:32.265 --> 01:44:33.467
AND THEY THOUGHT THAT SUGARY

01:44:33.533 --> 01:44:34.568
DRINKS WOULD BE ON THE TOP OF

01:44:34.635 --> 01:44:37.104
THAT LIST UNFORTUNATELY WHAT WE

01:44:37.170 --> 01:44:38.038
FOUND IS THAT PEOPLE WEREN'T

01:44:38.105 --> 01:44:40.273
EATING HEALTHIER PRODUCTS SO WE

01:44:40.340 --> 01:44:41.608
ACCESS TO FRESH FRUITS.

01:44:41.675 --> 01:44:43.010
FRESH VEGETABLES AND THE

01:44:43.076 --> 01:44:45.045
EXAMPLES WERE NOT JUST THE US

01:44:45.112 --> 01:44:47.114
BUT ALSO IN MEXICO CLEAN

01:44:47.180 --> 01:44:48.915
DRINKING WATER AT THOSE WERE THE

01:44:48.982 --> 01:44:50.317
FACTORS.

01:44:50.384 --> 01:44:55.689
I'VE BEEN GIVEN TIME GO AHEAD

01:44:55.756 --> 01:44:58.992
LET MY PROBABLY FINISHED.

01:44:59.059 --> 01:45:01.995
I GOTTA TALK FASTER.

01:45:02.062 --> 01:45:02.829
THIS GERMAN MEMBERS -- JOHN MY

01:45:02.896 --> 01:45:04.297
RUN HAVE CALIFORNIA RETAILERS

01:45:04.364 --> 01:45:06.266
ASSOCIATION -- FIRST OF ALL ARM

01:45:06.333 --> 01:45:07.000
OUR MEMBERS ARE OPPOSED -- TO

01:45:07.067 --> 01:45:07.901
PRODUCT SPECIFIC TARGETED TAXES

01:45:07.968 --> 01:45:09.636
AGAIN WE HAVE A PHILOSOPHY WE

01:45:09.703 --> 01:45:11.538
WANT OUR ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS.

01:45:11.605 --> 01:45:13.173
TO BE ABLE HAVE CHOICES AND WE

01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:13.807
DON'T THINK WE SHOULD TAX THOSE

01:45:13.874 --> 01:45:15.942
CHOICES -- WE SHOULD PROVIDE

01:45:16.009 --> 01:45:17.644
THEM WITH A RANGE OF OPTIONS AND

01:45:17.711 --> 01:45:19.146
LET THEM MAKE WHAT BUT HOPEFULLY

01:45:19.212 --> 01:45:20.814
IS THE BEST OPTION FOR THEM -- I

01:45:20.881 --> 01:45:21.915
DO WANT TO GO BACK TO DATA POINT

01:45:21.982 --> 01:45:23.617
THAT GETS TRANSPOSED AWFUL LOT

01:45:23.684 --> 01:45:27.187
HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:45:27.254 --> 01:45:28.588
THE MAY.

01:45:28.655 --> 01:45:29.923
OFFERED BY THE PROPONENTS AND

01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:30.924
THE AUTHOR THAT THAT ADDED

01:45:30.991 --> 01:45:32.059
SUGARS THAT SOFT DRINKS SUGAR

01:45:32.125 --> 01:45:33.226
SWEETENED BEVERAGES ARE THE

01:45:33.293 --> 01:45:34.895
FOREIGN AWAY THE MAJORITY OF THE

01:45:34.961 --> 01:45:36.029
CALORIES FROM ADDED SUGARS IN

01:45:36.096 --> 01:45:36.897
OUR DIET.

01:45:36.963 --> 01:45:38.865
AND WHILE I DON'T DISAGREE THAT

01:45:38.932 --> 01:45:40.200
THE CDC NUMBERS TO TELL US THE

01:45:40.267 --> 01:45:41.334
MOST RECENT ONES THAT THE

01:45:41.401 --> 01:45:43.003
PERCENTAGE OF CALORIES FROM

01:45:43.070 --> 01:45:44.705
ADDED SUGARS IN OUR DIE.

01:45:44.771 --> 01:45:45.872
FROM ALL BEVERAGES THAT ARE

01:45:45.939 --> 01:45:48.108
SUGAR SWEETENED OR ABOUT 48% OF

01:45:48.175 --> 01:45:49.576
THOSE CALORIES.

01:45:49.643 --> 01:45:51.211
WHAT'S NOT CLEAR HOWEVER WE HAVE

01:45:51.278 --> 01:45:53.146
TO BE CLEAR HEREIS THAT THE

01:45:53.213 --> 01:45:55.048
CALORIES FROM ADDED SUGAR IN OUR

01:45:55.115 --> 01:45:57.150
DIET OR LESS THAN 6% OF THE

01:45:57.217 --> 01:45:58.585
CALORIES IN OUR DIET.

01:45:58.652 --> 01:46:00.053
SO IT ISN'T THAT THE NUMBER OF

01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:01.722
CALORIES FROM ADDED SUGAR THAT'S

01:46:01.788 --> 01:46:02.956
COMING FROM SUGAR SWEETENED

01:46:03.023 --> 01:46:04.424
BEVERAGES YES IT'S IT'S THE

01:46:04.491 --> 01:46:05.225
LARGEST.

01:46:05.292 --> 01:46:06.560
LARGEST PERCENTAGE NOT THE

01:46:06.626 --> 01:46:09.029
MAJORITY TO LARGEST PERCENTAGE

01:46:09.096 --> 01:46:11.298
BUT AS OF THE CALORIES OF ADDED

01:46:11.364 --> 01:46:13.433
SUGAR AS AS MS -- AS FREDERICK

01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:14.935
WAS SAYING A MOMENT AGO.

01:46:15.001 --> 01:46:16.403
THE CALORIES THAT ARE DRIVING

01:46:16.470 --> 01:46:17.971
THE CONSUMPTION PATTERN IN THE

01:46:18.038 --> 01:46:19.873
AMERICAN DIET IN PARTICULAR ARE

01:46:19.940 --> 01:46:22.275
NOT FROM BEVERAGES THERE FROM

01:46:22.342 --> 01:46:23.210
MANY OTHER FOOD SOURCES

01:46:23.276 --> 01:46:25.412
INCLUDING DAIRY PRODUCTS OVER

01:46:25.479 --> 01:46:26.813
GRAIN PRODUCTS.

01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:28.248
BEEF PRODUCTS ETCETERA ETCETERA

01:46:28.315 --> 01:46:29.950
SO BUT IT'S AGAIN IT'S IMPORTANT

01:46:30.016 --> 01:46:31.518
TO UNDERSTAND THAT PROPER THAT

01:46:31.585 --> 01:46:32.619
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN

01:46:32.686 --> 01:46:34.721
TERMS OF THE DATA HERE -- FINAL

01:46:34.788 --> 01:46:37.190
FINAL POINT AGAIN WE HAVE

CONSISTENTLY OPPOSED THESE

01:46:37.791 --> 01:46:39.793
MEASURES -- THE ONE THING THAT

01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:41.862
WE WOULDN'T DISPUTE -- THAT -- A

01:46:41.928 --> 01:46:43.096
SOMEONE BLOOM SAID THERE IS A

01:46:43.163 --> 01:46:44.631
CLEAR CAN'T BE IMPACTS CERTAINLY

01:46:44.698 --> 01:46:45.766
ON OUR CONSUMERS AND IT MAY

01:46:45.832 --> 01:46:46.800
CHOOSE THEM TO SWITCH.

01:46:46.867 --> 01:46:48.301
BUT BUT THE INDUSTRY AND

01:46:48.368 --> 01:46:50.403
RETAILERS HAVE GONE ON THEIR OWN

01:46:50.470 --> 01:46:51.671
TO AGGRESSIVELY PUT MEANT

01:46:51.738 --> 01:46:57.344
MULTIPLE OTHER CHOICES OUT THERE

01:46:57.410 --> 01:47:01.281
FOR FOLKS.

ANY PROGRAM THAT CAME OUT OF

01:49:57.023 --> 01:49:57.791
THIS.

01:49:57.857 --> 01:49:59.592

CHEAPER OR FREE WAS A REAL ISSUE

01:50:01.828 --> 01:50:03.063

VOTED NO.

01:50:12.572 --> 01:50:13.506

DAD HAS THE MONEY TO CHOOSE

01:50:15.308 --> 01:50:16.509
DIFFERENTLY.

01:50:16.576 --> 01:50:17.877

THERE'S BEEN SOME -- ASSUMPTIONS

01:51:07.694 --> 01:51:10.196
THAT THE THAT THE THE AMOUNT OF

01:51:10.263 --> 01:51:11.731

THINK -- IT'S A TECHNICAL

01:51:20.173 --> 01:51:22.175
QUESTION BEST ANSWERED BY THEM

01:51:22.242 --> 01:51:25.678
BUT IT SHOULD BE SELF EVIDENT

01:51:25.745 --> 01:51:28.048
THAT CONSUMPTION IS SOMETHING

01:51:28.114 --> 01:51:30.250
THAT TAKES PLACE TODAY THE D.

01:51:30.316 --> 01:51:32.552
DISEASE PROCESS PROCEEDS OVER A

01:51:32.619 --> 01:51:33.853
LONG PERIOD OF TIME SO WHEN

WE'RE STUDYING THESE THINGS

01:51:36.122 --> 01:51:36.589

01:51:52.338 --> 01:51:53.273
GONE DOWN BUT IT REMAINS HIGH SO

01:51:53.339 --> 01:51:54.707
HALF OF ADULTS CONSUMERS AGREE

01:51:54.774 --> 01:51:56.643
DRINK ON ANY GIVEN DAY AND MORE

01:51:56.709 --> 01:51:58.111
THAN 60% OF CHILDREN.

01:51:58.178 --> 01:51:59.612
SO THE NUMBERS ARE GOING DOWN

01:51:59.679 --> 01:52:01.614
BUT THEY'RE STILL UBIQUITOUSLY

01:52:01.681 --> 01:52:08.855

THAT AND THEN I WILL ALSO ADD

01:52:18.998 --> 01:52:20.333
THAT I'M IN CALIFORNIA FOR

01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:22.135

SODAS OUT OF SCHOOLS CHILDHOOD

01:52:24.270 --> 01:52:25.672
OBESITY RATES -- PREVALENCE

01:52:25.738 --> 01:52:27.440
RATHER AND DECREASED AN

01:52:27.507 --> 01:52:28.908
OVERWEIGHT RATES HAVE DECREASED

01:52:28.975 --> 01:52:33.980
AS WELL SO THE LOCUS OF AND OF

01:52:34.047 --> 01:52:34.581
EFFORT HAS BEEN ON CHILDHOOD

01:52:34.647 --> 01:52:35.548
OBESITY PREVENTION AND THAT IS

01:52:35.615 --> 01:52:36.983
THE AREA OF THE POPULATION WHICH

01:52:37.050 --> 01:52:39.219
WE HAVE SEE AN APPLIED TELLING

01:52:39.285 --> 01:52:43.056
ABOUT THE CITY RATES.

01:52:43.123 --> 01:52:44.357
Q..

01:52:44.424 --> 01:52:45.325
AND THIS.

01:52:45.391 --> 01:52:50.330

THAT'S ALL WE HAVE OKAY OKAY AND

01:52:54.901 --> 01:52:56.002
THE SECOND QUESTION IS -- I

01:52:56.069 --> 01:52:57.737
THINK I KNOW THE ANSWER BY NEED

01:52:57.804 --> 01:52:58.371
MAYBE YOU CAN HELP AND LIGHTNESS

01:52:58.438 --> 01:52:59.038
THAT.

01:52:59.105 --> 01:53:00.507
NO THERE'S ARGUMENTS IT'S NOT

01:53:00.573 --> 01:53:01.674
YES SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES

01:53:01.741 --> 01:53:02.842
LIKE A TV TO THE CAN TO

01:53:02.909 --> 01:53:04.844
CONTRIBUTE TO THE INSANE

01:53:04.911 --> 01:53:06.746
INCREASE IN -- IN CALORIES FOR

01:53:06.813 --> 01:53:09.115
INDIVIDUALS AND OF COURSE THE

01:53:09.182 --> 01:53:10.917
THE OBESITY RATE.

01:53:10.984 --> 01:53:11.484
AND THAT FOLKS WOULD SAY WHY

01:53:11.551 --> 01:53:13.052
DON'T YOU DISCRIMINATING AGAINST

01:53:13.119 --> 01:53:14.687
CHOCOLATE CAKE HEARD SNICKERS

BARS OR CHEESE BURGERS AND I I

01:53:16.256 --> 01:53:17.657
THINK YOUR YOUR ARGUMENT IS THAT.

01:53:17.724 --> 01:53:19.626
SODA ARE ARE EMPTY CALORIES

01:53:19.692 --> 01:53:21.227
UNLIKE A POTENTIAL SMOOTHLY

01:53:21.294 --> 01:53:22.695
WHICH HAS SOME VALUE IN

01:53:22.762 --> 01:53:26.065
NUTRITION A SODA FOR SERVICE WE

01:53:26.132 --> 01:53:27.467
MEMBERS ARE EMPTY CALORIES IS

01:53:27.534 --> 01:53:28.968
THAT WHAT THEY ARE WE I THINK

01:53:29.035 --> 01:53:30.770
IT'S A MISTAKE TO GET LOST IN

01:53:30.837 --> 01:53:33.540
THE DISCUSSION OF OF OF CALORIES --

01:53:33.606 --> 01:53:36.209
THE A SIMPLE FACT ABOUT SUGARY

01:53:36.276 --> 01:53:38.845
BEVERAGES IS THAT LIQUID SUGAR

01:53:38.912 --> 01:53:40.747
IS METABOLIZED DIFFERENTLY AND

01:53:40.813 --> 01:53:44.918
IN THE IN THE BODY -- IT TO A IS

01:53:44.984 --> 01:53:46.052
PROCESS BY THE PANCREAS AND IS

01:53:46.119 --> 01:53:49.322
DEPOSITED IN THE BODY IS FAT --

01:53:49.389 --> 01:53:51.591
IN VERY RAPID FASHION SO THE

01:53:51.658 --> 01:53:54.894
MORE LIQUID SUGAR ONE CONSUMES

01:53:54.961 --> 01:53:56.896
THE MORE LIKELY ONE AS TO BECOME

01:53:56.963 --> 01:53:59.332
OBESE OVER A RELATIVELY SHORT

01:53:59.399 --> 01:54:00.266
PERIOD OF TIME.

01:54:00.333 --> 01:54:05.038
OKAY AND THEN JUST JUST A FEW

01:54:05.104 --> 01:54:07.707
POINTS I WANT.

01:54:07.774 --> 01:54:09.375
TO TOUCH ON AS YOU NOTED.

01:54:09.442 --> 01:54:10.443
THESE POLICIES WORK WHEN THESE

01:54:10.510 --> 01:54:12.245
POLICIES STARTED IN MEXICO THE

01:54:12.312 --> 01:54:12.879
OPPOSITION SAID.

01:54:12.946 --> 01:54:13.913
WELL THAT'S MEXICO IS DIFFERENT

01:54:13.980 --> 01:54:15.381
THERE.

IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS IT'S

01:54:50.450 --> 01:54:50.984

OVER USE THE TERM CRISIS BUT IT

01:59:36.702 --> 01:59:39.338
IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE -- THAT WHEN

01:59:39.405 --> 01:59:41.774
IT COMES TO DIABETES AND AND AND

01:59:41.841 --> 01:59:42.875

THINGS THAT WE HAVE A WE HAVE A

01:59:44.410 --> 01:59:47.079

WHO IS A PEDIATRIC DENTIST --

01:59:50.449 --> 01:59:51.751
AND JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO THAT

01:59:51.817 --> 01:59:52.952
WAS IN THE OFFICE HAVING A

01:59:53.019 --> 01:59:54.387
MEETING WENT OVER TO MY PHONE

01:59:54.453 --> 01:59:57.223
AND SAW ON MY PHONE -- A PICTURE

01:59:57.290 --> 01:59:59.825
OF A OF A OF A CHILD THAT SHE

01:59:59.892 --> 02:00:01.127
JUST WORKED ON WAS ABOUT TO WORK

02:00:01.193 --> 02:00:03.996
ON AT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE

02:00:04.063 --> 02:00:05.665
THE THE THE THESE TEETH WERE

02:00:05.731 --> 02:00:07.466
COMPLETELY CAVITY WRITTEN EVERY

02:00:07.533 --> 02:00:11.804
SINGLE ONE OF THEM COMPLETELY.

02:00:11.871 --> 02:00:12.371
DARK.

02:00:12.438 --> 02:00:13.606
AND THEN SHE TEXTED AFTER I

02:00:13.673 --> 02:00:14.206
LOOKED AT THIS AND SAID OH MY

02:00:14.273 --> 02:00:14.607
GOSH.

02:00:14.674 --> 02:00:17.310
THE FIVE YEAR OLD CHILD.

02:00:17.376 --> 02:00:19.245
THE FIVE YEAR OLD CHILD EVERY

02:00:19.312 --> 02:00:20.646
SINGLE TOOTH WAS COMPLETELY

02:00:20.713 --> 02:00:22.548
CAVITY OF LADEN AND IT WAS

02:00:22.615 --> 02:00:24.150
BECAUSE OF SUGAR SWEETENED

02:00:24.216 --> 02:00:25.651
SWEETENED BEVERAGES.

02:00:25.718 --> 02:00:27.019
AND THEN YOU THINK TO YOURSELF

02:00:27.086 --> 02:00:28.254
WELL WHAT IS IT THAT WE GET WITH

02:00:28.321 --> 02:00:29.655
THAT WE CAN -- THAT WE CAN DO

02:00:29.722 --> 02:00:31.857
ABOUT ABOUT THIS -- IS IT

02:00:31.924 --> 02:00:33.225
EDUCATION WELL THAT IS

02:00:33.292 --> 02:00:35.127
INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT -- BECAUSE

02:00:35.194 --> 02:00:36.562
IT REALLY IS A PART OF OUR OF

02:00:36.629 --> 02:00:38.598
OUR SOCIETY AND YET THE REASON I

02:00:38.664 --> 02:00:40.232
SAID THAT I WAS A TORN ABOUT

02:00:40.299 --> 02:00:42.001
THIS BECAUSE I THINK THE INTENT

02:00:42.068 --> 02:00:44.236
OF THE AUTHORS -- BILL IS TO BE

02:00:44.303 --> 02:00:46.339

AND YET I ALSO KNOW -- THAT --

02:00:51.377 --> 02:00:52.912
TOBACCO IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM AND

02:00:52.979 --> 02:00:54.914
I VOTED AGAINST THE TOBACCO TAX

02:00:54.981 --> 02:00:56.048
AND THE REASON I VOTED AGAINST

02:00:56.115 --> 02:00:57.416
THE TOBACCO TAXES BECAUSE

02:00:57.483 --> 02:00:59.585
PHILOSOPHICALLY WHEN I THINK.

02:00:59.652 --> 02:01:02.421
OF OF OF WHAT OUR TAX SYSTEM IS

02:01:02.488 --> 02:01:03.689

INTO THE THE GOVERNMENT TO BE

02:01:05.391 --> 02:01:08.227
ABLE -- TO TO DEAL WITH -- ARE

02:01:08.294 --> 02:01:10.196
ARE THE NEEDS OF OUR BAR BASIC

02:01:10.262 --> 02:01:11.497
OUR BASIC NEEDS IT'S NOT TO

02:01:11.564 --> 02:01:13.599
INCENTIVIZE -- OR DISINCENTIVE

02:01:13.666 --> 02:01:15.368
EYES BEHAVIOR AND SO I DO I

02:01:15.434 --> 02:01:16.836
STRUGGLE WITH THIS AND I'VE GONE

02:01:16.902 --> 02:01:18.270
BACK AND FORTH IN MY HEAD WITH

02:01:18.337 --> 02:01:19.338
THAT WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS --

02:01:19.405 --> 02:01:20.873
TODAY BECAUSE YOUR INTENT IS

02:01:20.940 --> 02:01:22.675
ABSOLUTELY ACCURATE WE HAVE A

02:01:22.742 --> 02:01:24.210
PROBLEM AND I WISH THAT PEOPLE

02:01:24.276 --> 02:01:26.078
ARE WATCHING AT HOME WATCHING

02:01:26.145 --> 02:01:26.646
THIS COMMITTEE HEARING WHICH

02:01:26.712 --> 02:01:28.114
THEY'RE NOT.

02:01:28.180 --> 02:01:30.549
I WISH THAT WE ARE HAVING THESE.

02:01:30.616 --> 02:01:36.522
THEY'RE NOT -- I DON'T KNOW WHY

02:01:36.589 --> 02:01:40.993
YOU ALL ARE HERE BUT BUT BUT

02:01:41.060 --> 02:01:41.627
PEOPLE AREN'T PAYING ATTENTION

02:01:41.694 --> 02:01:42.294
TO BUT IT IS AFFECTING OUR LIVES

02:01:42.361 --> 02:01:42.962
IT IS AFFECTING BY THE WAY IT IS

02:01:43.029 --> 02:01:43.796
AFFECTING OUR BUDGET.

02:01:43.863 --> 02:01:44.630
IS WELL -- I'VE HAD LOTS OF

02:01:44.697 --> 02:01:45.965
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS OVER

02:01:46.032 --> 02:01:47.233
OVER THE FALLS -- WAS AT A

02:01:47.299 --> 02:01:48.768
CONFERENCE A LEARNED QUITE A BIT

02:01:48.834 --> 02:01:50.169
QUITE A BIT ABOUT IT AND SUGAR

02:01:50.236 --> 02:01:51.671
IS TOXIC.

02:01:51.737 --> 02:01:53.472
AND THE LEVELS OF SUGAR THAT WE

02:01:53.539 --> 02:01:55.875
ARE TAKING IN IS IS TOXIC AND

02:01:55.941 --> 02:01:57.176
YET I STILL STRUGGLE WITH

02:01:57.243 --> 02:01:59.378
WHETHER THIS IS THE BEST AVENUE.

02:01:59.445 --> 02:02:01.313
A TO BE ABLE TO BUT TO GO DOWN

02:02:01.380 --> 02:02:02.982
TO BE ABLE TO SOLVE A SOLVE THIS

02:02:03.049 --> 02:02:04.984
PROBLEM -- BUT THERE'S NO

02:02:05.051 --> 02:02:09.188
QUESTION THERE BUT JUST AGAIN

02:02:09.255 --> 02:02:09.789
THE THE LADY YOU KNOW WHERE I

02:02:09.855 --> 02:02:11.924
WHERE I'M AT WELL ASSEMBLY

02:02:11.991 --> 02:02:12.525
MEMBER LET ME TRY TO ANSWER IT

02:02:12.591 --> 02:02:14.326
ANYWAY -- THE THERE'S NO

02:02:14.393 --> 02:02:15.327
QUESTION PENDING WITH THE

02:02:15.394 --> 02:02:19.598
PERMISSION OF THE CHAIR -- WE

02:02:19.665 --> 02:02:21.567
DON'T HAVE ANYWHERE ELSE TO LOOK

02:02:21.634 --> 02:02:22.835
FOR THIS KIND OF PREVENTION

02:02:22.902 --> 02:02:24.270
PROGRAM AND IF YOU IF IF IF YOU

02:02:24.336 --> 02:02:26.405
THINK ABOUT IT WE HAVE TO FUND

02:02:26.472 --> 02:02:28.441
PREVENTION IN ORDER TO MAKE SOME

02:02:28.507 --> 02:02:29.842
PROGRESS JUST LIKE WE DID.

02:02:29.909 --> 02:02:34.380
WITH TOBACCO AND I DISAGREE WITH

02:02:34.447 --> 02:02:36.082
HOW YOU VOTED ON THE TOBACCO TAX

02:02:36.148 --> 02:02:37.416
BUT I THINK WE WOULD PROBABLY

02:02:37.483 --> 02:02:39.652
AGREE THAT THERE HAS BEEN A

02:02:39.719 --> 02:02:41.987
SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE IN PEOPLE'S

02:02:42.054 --> 02:02:43.222
BEHAVIOR.

02:02:43.289 --> 02:02:45.725
AND AS A RESULT OF THAT FROM THE

02:02:45.791 --> 02:02:47.359
TOBACCO TAXES OVER TIME.

02:02:47.426 --> 02:02:49.929
AS A RESULT OF THAT WE HAVE SEEN

02:02:49.995 --> 02:02:51.297
PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING LONGER

02:02:51.363 --> 02:02:53.933
LIVES WHO ARE LESS DISEASE

02:02:53.999 --> 02:02:55.668
RIDDEN THAN A HAPPEN AND AND IN

02:02:55.735 --> 02:02:57.503
THE PAST.

02:02:57.570 --> 02:02:58.771
SO.

02:02:58.838 --> 02:03:00.973
YOU KNOW I'LL I LOOK AT THIS AS

02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:02.875
SOMETHING THAT IS VERY NOW IT'S

02:03:02.942 --> 02:03:05.111
VERY FOCUSED SOME FOLKS HAVE

02:03:05.177 --> 02:03:06.946
SAID DON'T TAKE MY CHOICE AWAY

02:03:07.012 --> 02:03:10.149
WE DON'T TAKE ANYBODY'S CHOICE

02:03:10.216 --> 02:03:11.717
AWAY TO DRINK ANYTHING.

02:03:11.784 --> 02:03:13.052
IT WILL BE A LITTLE BIT MORE

02:03:13.119 --> 02:03:14.787
EXPENSIVE FOR YOU TO DRINK

02:03:14.854 --> 02:03:17.356
SOMETHING THAT IS LESS HEALTHY

02:03:17.423 --> 02:03:18.224
FOR YOU.

02:03:18.290 --> 02:03:20.226
AND SO THAT IS A FACT BUT WE

02:03:20.292 --> 02:03:21.827
DON'T TAKE THE ULTIMATE CHOICE

02:03:21.894 --> 02:03:24.463
AWAY FROM PEOPLE WHAT WE DO IS

02:03:24.530 --> 02:03:26.265
WE TAKE THAT MONEY AND WE POUR

02:03:26.332 --> 02:03:26.932
IT.

02:03:26.999 --> 02:03:29.435
INTO PROGRAMS THAT WILL HELP

02:03:29.502 --> 02:03:30.636
EVERYONE.

02:03:30.703 --> 02:03:33.405
EVE EVEN IF YOU ARE ONE OF THE

02:03:33.472 --> 02:03:38.110
FORTUNATE WHO NEVER HAVE A BAD --

02:03:38.177 --> 02:03:39.712
HEALTH PROBLEMS IN YOUR LIFE AND

02:03:39.779 --> 02:03:41.614
IT DOES YOU KNOW WE WE MARVEL AT

02:03:41.680 --> 02:03:43.449
THOSE PEOPLE WHO LIVE HEALTHY

02:03:43.516 --> 02:03:45.951
LIVES AND PASS AWAY HAVING HAD

02:03:46.018 --> 02:03:48.053
NO SERIOUS ILLNESSES -- THOSE

02:03:48.120 --> 02:03:50.089
CASES DO EXIST BUT EVEN FOR

02:03:50.156 --> 02:03:51.924
THOSE PEOPLE THEIR INSURANCE

02:03:51.991 --> 02:03:54.393
RATES WILL BE LESS OVER TIME IF

02:03:54.460 --> 02:03:57.296
WE'RE ABLE. TO BRING THIS

02:03:57.363 --> 02:03:59.064
DISEASE AND THE AND THE VARIOUS

02:03:59.131 --> 02:04:01.667
DISEASES THAT EXIST AS A RESULT

02:04:01.734 --> 02:04:03.202
OF THE CRISIS THAT WE'RE TALKING

02:04:03.269 --> 02:04:05.571
ABOUT IF WE'RE ABLE TO BRING

02:04:05.638 --> 02:04:07.406
THOSE DISEASE RATES DOWN.

02:04:07.473 --> 02:04:10.442
SO THERE IS NO NEGATIVE SIDE TO

02:04:10.509 --> 02:04:12.077
THIS OTHER THAN IT WILL COST A

02:04:12.144 --> 02:04:19.618
FEW MORE PENNIES. FOR A DRINK.

02:04:19.685 --> 02:04:20.419
MR FLOOR.

02:04:20.486 --> 02:04:21.754
MR BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON

02:04:21.821 --> 02:04:23.055
THIS -- OBVIOUSLY I'M I'M NOT

02:04:23.122 --> 02:04:25.691
GONNA BE ABLE TO TO GET THERE

02:04:25.758 --> 02:04:28.828
BUT I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS

02:04:28.894 --> 02:04:33.332
OBVIOUS.

02:04:33.399 --> 02:04:35.134
I'M I'M HOLDING OUT HOPE.

02:04:35.201 --> 02:04:36.035
YEAH.

02:04:36.101 --> 02:04:37.369
WELL WE'LL WE'LL TALK ABOUT SOME

02:04:37.436 --> 02:04:38.070
OTHER BILLS -- BUT I AM

02:04:38.137 --> 02:04:38.938
CONCERNED -- WITH THIS BECAUSE

02:04:39.004 --> 02:04:39.939
THERE IS I MEAN I REPRESENT A

02:04:40.005 --> 02:04:40.806
POPULATION OF OF THE CENTRAL

02:04:40.873 --> 02:04:41.440
VALLEY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CLEAN

02:04:41.507 --> 02:04:41.807
DRINKING WATER.

02:04:41.874 --> 02:04:43.709
THERE ARE PLACES WHERE -- I WAS

02:04:43.776 --> 02:04:44.510
JUST LOOKING AT SOME OF THE

02:04:44.577 --> 02:04:45.778
AVERAGE IS ON WHAT IT COSTS FOR

02:04:45.845 --> 02:04:47.413
BOTTLE WATER VERSUS THE COST FOR

02:04:47.479 --> 02:04:50.349
A TWELVE OUNCE SODA.

02:04:50.416 --> 02:04:51.417
THESE NUMBERS ARE REAL.

02:04:51.483 --> 02:04:51.951
AND SO LIKE HAVING THESE

02:04:52.017 --> 02:04:52.952
CONVERSATIONS I THINK ARE VERY

02:04:53.018 --> 02:04:53.586
VERY IMPORTANT BUT I EIGHT I DO

02:04:53.652 --> 02:04:54.920
THINK THERE'S ONE VERY IMPORTANT

02:04:54.987 --> 02:04:55.688
THING WE'RE MISSING IN ALL OF

02:04:55.754 --> 02:04:57.990
THIS -- CHILDHOOD OBESITY

02:04:58.057 --> 02:05:00.593
CONVERSATION AND AS A LACK OF

02:05:00.659 --> 02:05:02.228
EXERCISE THAT OUR KIDS ARE DOING.

02:05:02.294 --> 02:05:03.128
LIKE THIS STATE WE DON'T WE

02:05:03.195 --> 02:05:04.630
DON'T ADDRESS THIS AT ALL WE

02:05:04.697 --> 02:05:06.332
TEND TO TAX EVERYTHING THAT WE

02:05:06.398 --> 02:05:07.700
DON'T WANT TO OUR KIDS TO DO

02:05:07.766 --> 02:05:09.101
WHAT WE DON'T WANT OUR KIDS TO

02:05:09.168 --> 02:05:10.269
CONSUME THESE THINGS.

02:05:10.336 --> 02:05:11.704
BUT THE EXERCISE PROGRAMS AFTER

02:05:11.770 --> 02:05:13.839
SCHOOL PROGRAMS THE THINGS WE DO

02:05:13.906 --> 02:05:15.808
FOR OUR KIDS TO GET THEM OUT

02:05:15.875 --> 02:05:17.977
THERE AND TO GET THEM ACTIVE I

02:05:18.043 --> 02:05:19.245
THINK WE'RE MISSING THAT.

02:05:19.311 --> 02:05:20.346
WE CAN CUT OUT ALL THE SODA IN

02:05:20.412 --> 02:05:21.914
THE WORLD THEY COULD DRINK WATER

02:05:21.981 --> 02:05:24.850
1100% OF THE TIME. TO GO TO ANY

02:05:24.917 --> 02:05:26.685
TO WHATEVER THEY'RE EATING AND

02:05:26.752 --> 02:05:27.820
THEY'RE NOT EXERCISING DEFER

02:05:27.887 --> 02:05:29.255
SETTING IN FRONT OF THEIR TV.

02:05:29.321 --> 02:05:30.689
PLAYING VIDEO GAMES ALL DAY WHEN

02:05:30.756 --> 02:05:31.523
THEY GET HOME.

02:05:31.590 --> 02:05:32.992
THIS WILL BE EASY THING IS A

02:05:33.058 --> 02:05:36.595
TRUE TRUE ISSUE LIKE CHAD -- I

02:05:36.662 --> 02:05:37.463
DRINK A LOT OF SO WHEN I WAS A

02:05:37.529 --> 02:05:39.031
KID BUT WAS ALSO VERY ACTIVE.

02:05:39.098 --> 02:05:40.799
OTHERWISE I WOULD HAVE ISSUES

02:05:40.866 --> 02:05:42.534
RIGHT MY DAUGHTERS I GOT TWO

02:05:42.601 --> 02:05:43.769
LITTLE GIRLS I'M IT'S A DECISION

02:05:43.836 --> 02:05:46.105
MY WIFE AND I HAVE MADE WE DON'T

02:05:46.171 --> 02:05:47.273
HAVE A LOT OF STUDENTS IN OUR

02:05:47.339 --> 02:05:48.040
HOUSE WE HAVE OTHER THINGS FOR

02:05:48.107 --> 02:05:48.540
THEM.

02:05:48.607 --> 02:05:50.676
OKAY THIS IS DECISIONS AND I AM

02:05:50.743 --> 02:05:52.311
JUST IN THE MODERN ERA OF

02:05:52.378 --> 02:05:53.746
TECHNOLOGY AND THE WAY THAT WE

02:05:53.812 --> 02:05:54.980
COMMUNICATE.

02:05:55.047 --> 02:05:57.283
STUDIES AND DATA AND AND THE

02:05:57.349 --> 02:05:59.151
DRIVERS IN THE MARKET YOU GO

02:05:59.218 --> 02:06:00.286
DOWN TO THE SUPERMARKET.

02:06:00.352 --> 02:06:01.453
THERE'S ALL SORTS OF HEALTHY

02:06:01.520 --> 02:06:03.722
OPTIONS AND THOSE WOULDN'T BE

02:06:03.789 --> 02:06:04.790
THERE IF CONSUMERS WERE BUYING

02:06:04.857 --> 02:06:06.158
THEM MANUFACTURERS ARE GOING TO

02:06:06.225 --> 02:06:07.693
PRODUCE PRODUCTS IF NOBODY'S

02:06:07.760 --> 02:06:08.694
BUYING THEM.

02:06:08.761 --> 02:06:10.396
SO I THINK AS A AS A GENERATION

02:06:10.462 --> 02:06:11.864
IS A CULTURAL CHANGE THAT WE ARE

02:06:11.931 --> 02:06:13.599
MAKING HERE THE MANUFACTURERS

02:06:13.666 --> 02:06:15.100
ARE MAKING THOSE ADJUSTMENTS.

02:06:15.167 --> 02:06:16.035
AND I DO APPLAUD THAT NEW

02:06:16.101 --> 02:06:17.670
CONSUMERS OUT THERE FOR MAKING

02:06:17.736 --> 02:06:18.971
BETTER CHOICES BUT I WOULD I

02:06:19.038 --> 02:06:20.039
JUST WANNA PUT IT ON RECORD WE

02:06:20.105 --> 02:06:21.607
NEED TO HAVE SOME CONVERSATIONS

02:06:21.674 --> 02:06:23.275
ABOUT THE SCHOOL PROGRAMS.

02:06:23.342 --> 02:06:24.343
AND WHAT WE'RE DOING TO MAKE

02:06:24.410 --> 02:06:25.678
SURE OUR KIDS GET OUT OF THE

02:06:25.744 --> 02:06:27.479
HOUSE AND INTO AN EDUCATION

02:06:27.546 --> 02:06:29.915
PROGRAM AS RELATES TO EXERCISE

02:06:29.982 --> 02:06:31.417

02:07:55.768 --> 02:07:59.171
I'M YOUNG I DON'T REMEMBER WHEN

02:07:59.238 --> 02:08:03.375
WE WERE YOUNG AND WEALTHY.

02:08:03.442 --> 02:08:03.776
I'M STILL YOUNG.

02:08:03.842 --> 02:08:05.077
OF YEAH WE WE TALK ABOUT THESE --

02:08:05.144 --> 02:08:06.145
EXPERIENTIAL IS AND AND AND AND

02:08:06.211 --> 02:08:08.080
AND I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE MY

YOU'RE HAVING.

02:08:14.353 --> 02:08:16.422
AND AND AND APPLYING IT TO YOUR

02:08:16.488 --> 02:08:18.490
REAL LIFE EXPERIENCE -- BUT WE

02:08:18.557 --> 02:08:20.692
ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT THE CHANGES

02:08:20.759 --> 02:08:22.394
THAT HAVE HAPPENED IN THE PAST

02:08:22.461 --> 02:08:23.962
COUPLE OF DECADES WHILE WE'VE

02:08:24.029 --> 02:08:24.830
BEEN.

02:08:24.897 --> 02:08:27.032
OF MATURING IN THIS PROCESS SO

02:08:27.099 --> 02:08:28.233
WHEN WE WERE YOUNG WE DIDN'T

02:08:28.300 --> 02:08:30.936
HAVE TO THE SUPER GULP SIZES.

02:08:31.003 --> 02:08:32.104
OF OUR MADE MAYBE I'M A LITTLE

02:08:32.171 --> 02:08:33.705
OLDER THAN YOU SO MAYBE YOU HAD

02:08:33.772 --> 02:08:36.141
IN YOUR YOUTH -- BUT BUT

02:08:36.208 --> 02:08:39.812
MARKETING HAS CHANGED OF THE THE

02:08:39.878 --> 02:08:41.980
PRODUCT HAS CHANGED -- THE

02:08:42.047 --> 02:08:43.715
AGGRESSIVENESS.

02:08:43.782 --> 02:08:45.517
OF THESE PRODUCTS AND THEIR

02:08:45.584 --> 02:08:47.453
MARKETING HAS CHANGED.

02:08:47.519 --> 02:08:48.720
IN FACT THEY I WASN'T REALLY

02:08:48.787 --> 02:08:50.289
GOING TO MAKE A COMMENT BUT WHEN

02:08:50.355 --> 02:08:51.757
I ALSO HEARD ABOUT HOW.

02:08:51.824 --> 02:08:53.992
SODA CONSUMPTION HAS GONE DOWN

02:08:54.059 --> 02:08:58.997
BUT IN ITS PLACE -- SMOOTHIE

02:08:59.064 --> 02:08:59.898
CONSUMPTION HAS GONE UP.

02:08:59.965 --> 02:09:00.499
I DON'T CLAIM TO BE A HEALTH

02:09:00.566 --> 02:09:01.767
CARE PROFESSIONAL.

02:09:01.834 --> 02:09:04.336
BUT I THINK IT'S BETTER.

02:09:04.403 --> 02:09:06.939
TO CONSUME YOGURT BASED.

02:09:07.005 --> 02:09:08.907
NUTRITIONAL PRODUCTS THAT HAVE

02:09:08.974 --> 02:09:10.976
CERTAIN BACTERIA IN IT THAT IS

02:09:11.043 --> 02:09:12.444
ACTUALLY HELPFUL TO YOUR BODY.

02:09:12.511 --> 02:09:16.348
UP VERSES OF AS A SUGAR BASED

02:09:16.415 --> 02:09:18.250
DRINK THAT QUICKLY TURNS INTO

02:09:18.317 --> 02:09:21.120
STARCH AND CONTRIBUTES TO MANY

02:09:21.186 --> 02:09:23.388
OTHER DISEASES THAT WE SEE.

02:09:23.455 --> 02:09:25.457
ON A DAILY BASIS IMPACTING OUR

02:09:25.524 --> 02:09:26.892
STATE BUDGET AND IS ONLY GOING

02:09:26.959 --> 02:09:28.360
TO GROW.

02:09:28.427 --> 02:09:29.361
OVER TIME.

02:09:29.428 --> 02:09:32.097
WE THINK WE HAVE PROBLEMS NOW --

02:09:32.164 --> 02:09:34.566
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE BIGGEST COST

02:09:34.633 --> 02:09:37.169
DRIVERS IN HEALTH CARE?

02:09:37.236 --> 02:09:40.239
THE HEART DISEASE CANCER BY THE

02:09:40.305 --> 02:09:42.474
END DIABETES RELATED DISEASES

02:09:42.541 --> 02:09:45.177
AND IT'S ONLY GONNA GET WORSE

02:09:45.244 --> 02:09:46.945
OVER TIME IF WE DON'T.

02:09:47.012 --> 02:09:49.615
TRY TO TAKE STEPS THAT ARE GONNA

02:09:49.681 --> 02:09:51.216
IN A MEASURED WAY.

02:09:51.283 --> 02:09:53.418
UP CREATE A BALANCE.

02:09:53.485 --> 02:09:54.686
WE SAW THAT BALANCE HAPPEN IN

02:09:54.753 --> 02:09:56.155
THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY.

02:09:56.221 --> 02:09:57.823
AND AND I'M HOPING THAT THIS

02:09:57.890 --> 02:09:59.858
BALANCE HAPPENS -- THROUGH A

02:09:59.925 --> 02:10:01.160
MEASURE LIKE THIS THIS BALANCE

02:10:01.226 --> 02:10:03.328
HAS BROUGHT ABOUT IN THIS ARENA

02:10:03.395 --> 02:10:03.929

THE OTHER BILLS TODAY.

02:10:10.969 --> 02:10:12.771
BECAUSE I FEEL THAT IT'S GOING

02:10:12.838 --> 02:10:15.140
AFTER A GENERAL PRACTICE ON THE

02:10:15.207 --> 02:10:16.608
MARKETING SIDE.

02:10:16.675 --> 02:10:18.277
OF WHICH CAN THEN APPLY TO MANY

02:10:18.343 --> 02:10:19.411
OTHER.

02:10:19.478 --> 02:10:22.147
ARENAS BUT THIS IS SPECIFIC TO

LEAST. THREE YEARS -- AND THEN

02:10:34.026 --> 02:10:35.827
GOING ON MAYBE EVEN FIVE YEARS

02:10:35.894 --> 02:10:39.264

02:10:46.038 --> 02:10:47.506
CONCERNS I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO

02:10:47.573 --> 02:10:48.607
GO BACK ON MY COLLEAGUES HERE

02:10:48.674 --> 02:10:49.208
WITH WITH CHAD AND AND HE'S

02:10:49.274 --> 02:10:50.042
TALKING ABOUT.

02:10:50.108 --> 02:10:51.743
WHEN THEY'RE YOUNGER YEARS THEY

02:10:51.810 --> 02:10:53.912
STRIKE FIVE OR SIX SODAS A DAY

02:10:53.979 --> 02:10:54.713
AND THEN?

02:10:54.780 --> 02:10:56.481
IN I DON'T SEE THE HAVING ISSUES

02:10:56.548 --> 02:10:58.050
NOW WITH WITH OBESITY OR OR

02:10:58.116 --> 02:11:00.485
ANYTHING FOR THAT MATTER -- AND

02:11:00.552 --> 02:11:01.119
I THINK A LOT OF IT COMES UNDER

02:11:01.186 --> 02:11:02.754
CHOICE RIGHT YOU KNOW I TALK

02:11:02.821 --> 02:11:04.823
ABOUT MY GROUND SINCE -- I'D TO

02:11:04.890 --> 02:11:06.558
BILLY TAKE YOUR MY GRAND KIDS

02:11:06.625 --> 02:11:07.626
EVERY WEEKEND.

02:11:07.693 --> 02:11:10.629
AND I MAKE SURE THAT THEY EAT

02:11:10.696 --> 02:11:12.397
HEALTHY STAY ACTIVE.

02:11:12.464 --> 02:11:13.365
BUT NOT EVERYBODY HAS THAT

02:11:13.432 --> 02:11:14.900
OPPORTUNITY GLOVER STARTS AT

02:11:14.967 --> 02:11:16.768
HOME WITH THE UPBRINGING ARE.

02:11:16.835 --> 02:11:18.837
OUR PARENTS OR GRANDPARENTS OR

02:11:18.904 --> 02:11:21.306
WHOEVER SPECIALLY OR OR YOUR

02:11:21.373 --> 02:11:23.108
GENERATION COMES FOR THAT COMMON

02:11:23.175 --> 02:11:23.976
SENSE TELLS YOU THAT YOU

02:11:24.042 --> 02:11:24.977
SHOULDN'T BE DRINKING SODA EVERY

02:11:25.043 --> 02:11:27.312
DAY OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN IN

02:11:27.379 --> 02:11:34.219
I THINK SODA OR ANY ANY BEVERAGE

02:11:34.286 --> 02:11:35.320
THAT CONTAINS.

02:11:35.387 --> 02:11:36.388
MORE SUGAR THAN WHAT IT SHOULD.

02:11:36.455 --> 02:11:37.356
IS MAYBE PART OF IT BUT THAT'S

02:11:37.422 --> 02:11:38.457
NOT THE ONLY PART WHERE PEOPLE

02:11:38.523 --> 02:11:39.324
ARE HAVING DIABETES OBESITY

02:11:39.391 --> 02:11:40.392
THERE'S OTHER THINGS THAT WE DO

02:11:40.459 --> 02:11:41.493
IN LIFE OTHER THINGS THAT WE EAT --

02:11:41.560 --> 02:11:42.494
THESE ARE WE CONSUME AND I THINK

02:11:42.561 --> 02:11:44.563
THE LACK OF EXERCISE IS HUGE

02:11:44.630 --> 02:11:46.898
WITH THAT AS WELL.

02:11:46.965 --> 02:11:47.499

THEIR THEIR CHILD IN HIGH SCHOOL

02:11:50.369 --> 02:11:51.870
WHEN HE HAS P. E. ONE DAY A WEEK

02:11:51.937 --> 02:11:53.171
AND I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THAT EVEN

02:11:53.238 --> 02:11:55.707
CHANGE WERE WE ALREADY GOING TO

02:11:55.774 --> 02:11:58.243
A DIFFERENT WAY OUT OF LIFESTYLE

02:11:58.310 --> 02:12:00.679
THAT -- WE'RE NOT KEEPING

02:12:00.746 --> 02:12:01.413

DON'T SEE THAT IMPOSING A TAX ON

02:12:11.957 --> 02:12:13.125
SODA.

02:12:13.191 --> 02:12:14.960
IS GOING TO FIX EVERYTHING YOU

02:12:15.027 --> 02:12:16.161

02:12:16.228 --> 02:12:17.462
COMPONENT OF MANY OTHER

02:12:17.529 --> 02:12:18.930

AND ONCE AGAIN I LOOK BACK AT IT

02:12:23.702 --> 02:12:25.070
AS BEING.

02:12:25.137 --> 02:12:25.971
A CHOICE.

02:12:26.038 --> 02:12:28.540

ALMOST FOUR THOUSAND

CALIFORNIANS WERE HOSPITALIZED.

02:30:52.877 --> 02:30:55.179

02:30:56.714 --> 02:30:57.581
THOSE WHO HAVE A HISTORY OF

02:30:57.648 --> 02:30:58.783
SUBSTANCE ABUSE ARE

PRISONS AND JAILS.

02:31:03.020 --> 02:31:04.889
A RECENT RAND STUDY FOUND THAT

02:31:04.955 --> 02:31:06.991
58% OF CALIFORNIA INMATES REPORT

02:31:07.057 --> 02:31:08.526

FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS

02:31:12.997 --> 02:31:14.031
COMBINES COUNSELING AND

02:31:14.098 --> 02:31:15.866
BEHAVIORAL THERAPY WITH THE USE

02:31:15.933 --> 02:31:18.002

02:31:19.403 --> 02:31:20.438
PATIENT APPROACH.

02:31:20.504 --> 02:31:21.739
NEWER STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT

02:31:21.806 --> 02:31:23.407
MATT IS A MORE EFFECTIVE

02:31:23.474 --> 02:31:25.276
INTERVENTION TO TREAT OPIOID USE

02:31:25.342 --> 02:31:27.178
AN ALCOHOL ABUSE DISORDER THAN

02:31:27.244 --> 02:31:29.447
EITHER BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS

02:31:29.513 --> 02:31:30.915
OR MEDICATIONS ALONE.

02:31:30.981 --> 02:31:32.149
PROVIDING ACCESS TO THIS

02:31:32.216 --> 02:31:33.150
TREATMENT COULD RESULT IN

02:31:33.217 --> 02:31:35.219
SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL SAVINGS.

02:31:35.286 --> 02:31:36.754
A RECENT STUDY FOUND THAT

WHO RECEIVES TREATMENT FOR

02:31:39.590 --> 02:31:41.425
OPIATE USE COULD RESULT IN A

02:31:41.492 --> 02:31:42.726
THREE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR

02:31:42.793 --> 02:31:45.196
SAVINGS RELATED TO REDUCE COSTS?

02:31:45.262 --> 02:31:46.464
WITH REGARDS TO OUR CRIMINAL

02:31:46.530 --> 02:31:47.665
JUSTICE SYSTEM.

02:31:47.731 --> 02:31:50.935
OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND OUR

02:31:51.001 --> 02:31:51.802

02:31:51.869 --> 02:31:52.436
ALTHOUGH TREATMENT FOR SUBSTANCE

02:31:52.503 --> 02:31:53.304
ABUSE IS EXPANDING THROUGHOUT

02:31:53.370 --> 02:31:54.939
THE STATE COUNTY JAILS DO NOT

02:31:55.005 --> 02:31:56.574
RECEIVE ANY STATE OR FEDERAL

02:31:56.640 --> 02:31:57.842
FUNDS TO PROVIDE MAP FOR

02:31:57.908 --> 02:31:59.610
INDIVIDUALS IN CUSTODY.

02:31:59.677 --> 02:32:00.744
EXPOSURE TO THESE PROGRAMS

02:32:00.811 --> 02:32:02.613
DURING INCARCERATION CAN REDUCE

02:32:02.680 --> 02:32:04.348
DEATHS AND DRUG RELATED

02:32:04.415 --> 02:32:05.816
POISONINGS. FOR THE MORE STUDIES

02:32:05.883 --> 02:32:07.117
HAVE INDICATED THAT MAC REDUCE

02:32:07.184 --> 02:32:09.119
RE ENTRY INTO THE CRIMINAL

LINDEN BREED MAYOR OF THE CITY

AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO.

02:32:33.410 --> 02:32:35.479
WITH A HISTORY OF SUBSTANCE USE

02:32:35.546 --> 02:32:36.780
AND ARE SIGNIFICANTLY OVER

02:32:36.847 --> 02:32:38.349
REPRESENTED IN OUR JAILS AND

02:32:38.415 --> 02:32:40.351
PRISONS IN SAN FRANCISCO AN

02:32:40.417 --> 02:32:42.586
ESTIMATED 80%.

02:32:42.653 --> 02:32:44.121
OF THE EIGHTEEN THOUSAND

02:32:44.188 --> 02:32:45.389
INDIVIDUALS BOOKED IN OUR COUNTY

02:32:45.456 --> 02:32:46.390
JAIL.

02:32:46.457 --> 02:32:48.592
IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN HAD A HISTORY

02:32:48.659 --> 02:32:49.894
OF SUBSTANCE USE WHEN WE

02:32:49.960 --> 02:32:51.428
INCARCERATE PEOPLE WITHOUT

02:32:51.495 --> 02:32:52.930
PROVIDING THE PROPER SERVICES

02:32:52.997 --> 02:32:54.765
AND TREATMENT IT OFTEN LEADS TO

02:32:54.832 --> 02:32:56.734
SERIOUS HEALTH COMPLICATIONS.

02:32:56.800 --> 02:32:59.103
INCLUDING UNTREATED WITHDRAWAL

02:32:59.169 --> 02:33:01.305
DISRUPTED TREATMENT AND INCREASE

02:33:01.372 --> 02:33:03.140
RISK OF OVERDOSE.

02:33:03.207 --> 02:33:04.575
THESE HARMS ARE PREVENTABLE AND

02:33:04.642 --> 02:33:06.443
OUR PRIMARY DUE TO THE LACK OF

02:33:06.510 --> 02:33:07.878
ACCESS TO TREATMENT WHILE THEY

02:33:07.945 --> 02:33:10.614
IN CAR WHY THEY'RE IN JAIL. TO

02:33:10.681 --> 02:33:11.282
HELP THOSE SUFFERING FROM

02:33:11.348 --> 02:33:13.751
ADDICTION WE HAVE TO MEET THEM

02:33:13.817 --> 02:33:15.352
WHERE THEY ARE WITH PROVEN AND

02:33:15.419 --> 02:33:18.188
EFFECTIVE TREATMENT OPTIONS.

02:33:18.255 --> 02:33:20.257
IF WE CAN GET PEOPLE HELP WHILE

02:33:20.324 --> 02:33:22.459
THERE INCARCERATED WE CAN SET

02:33:22.526 --> 02:33:23.928
THEM UP FOR LATER SUCCESS AND

02:33:23.994 --> 02:33:25.729
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN

02:33:25.796 --> 02:33:27.631
OUR COMMUNITY STRUGGLING WITH

02:33:27.698 --> 02:33:29.233
SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER.

02:33:29.300 --> 02:33:30.935
I'VE SEEN TOO MANY PEOPLE I GREW

02:33:31.001 --> 02:33:33.003
UP WITH TOO MANY PEOPLE I WORK

02:33:33.070 --> 02:33:34.772
WITH IN THE COMMUNITY WHO WERE

02:33:34.838 --> 02:33:36.040
ADDICTED TO DRUGS.

02:33:36.106 --> 02:33:37.775
WENT TO JAIL AND WHEN THEY CAME

02:33:37.841 --> 02:33:39.543
OUT THEY WERE STILL STRUGGLING

02:33:39.610 --> 02:33:41.045
WITH ADDICTION.

02:33:41.111 --> 02:33:42.913
I'VE SEEN TOO MANY PEOPLE WHOSE

02:33:42.980 --> 02:33:44.448
ADDICTION WHILE INCARCERATED

02:33:44.515 --> 02:33:46.817
ONLY GOT WORSE PEOPLE LIKE MY

02:33:46.884 --> 02:33:48.886
BROTHER WHO'S BEEN IN JAIL FOR

02:33:48.953 --> 02:33:51.021
TWENTY YEARS AND WHO IS STILL TO

02:33:51.088 --> 02:33:52.623
THIS VERY DAY STRUGGLING WITH AN

02:33:52.690 --> 02:33:53.724
ADDICTION.

02:33:53.791 --> 02:33:55.893
HE HAS TRIED TO SEEK TREATMENT

02:33:55.960 --> 02:33:57.461
BUT LIKE SO MANY OTHER HE SO

02:33:57.528 --> 02:33:59.697
MANY OTHERS HE CONTINUES TO

02:33:59.763 --> 02:34:00.297
STRUGGLE.

02:34:00.364 --> 02:34:03.100
THE TRUTH IS IT'S EASY TO GET

02:34:03.167 --> 02:34:05.469
DRUGS IN JAIL AND WE NEED TO

02:34:05.536 --> 02:34:07.037
ALSO HAVE AN HONEST CONVERSATION

02:34:07.104 --> 02:34:08.172
ABOUT THAT.

02:34:08.238 --> 02:34:10.074
BUT SADLY IT'S NOT EASY TO GET

02:34:10.140 --> 02:34:12.376
TREATMENT WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT

02:34:12.443 --> 02:34:14.345
AND WITH THIS BILL WE CAN CHANGE

02:34:14.411 --> 02:34:15.012
THAT.

02:34:15.079 --> 02:34:16.513
ALTHOUGH TREATMENT FOR SUBSTANCE

02:34:16.580 --> 02:34:18.716
USE IS EXPANDING THROUGHOUT THE

02:34:18.782 --> 02:34:20.718
STATE THE COUNTY JAILS DO NOT

02:34:20.784 --> 02:34:21.986
HAVE ANY STATE OR FEDERALLY

02:34:22.052 --> 02:34:23.320
FUNDED SUPPORT TO PROVIDE

02:34:23.387 --> 02:34:25.155
TREATMENT TO INDIVIDUALS IN

02:34:25.222 --> 02:34:27.458
CUSTODY BECAUSE INMATES DON'T

02:34:27.524 --> 02:34:28.892
QUALIFY FOR MEDICARE.

02:34:28.959 --> 02:34:30.527
REIMBURSEMENT THE FACT THAT

02:34:30.594 --> 02:34:32.129
SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT IS

02:34:32.196 --> 02:34:33.731
COVERED UNDER MEDICARE ONCE AN

02:34:33.797 --> 02:34:35.799
INDIVIDUAL IS RELEASED FROM JAIL

02:34:35.866 --> 02:34:37.968
BUT NOT COVERED WALL THAT

02:34:38.035 --> 02:34:40.104
INDIVIDUAL IS ACTUALLY IN JAIL

02:34:40.170 --> 02:34:42.039
MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE WE

02:34:42.106 --> 02:34:43.841
NEED TO DO EVERYTHING THAT WE

02:34:43.907 --> 02:34:45.376
CAN TO REHABILITATE PEOPLE.

02:34:45.442 --> 02:34:47.811
AND FOR MANY PEOPLE SUBSTANCE

02:34:47.878 --> 02:34:49.947
USE TREATMENT WHILE INCARCERATED

02:34:50.014 --> 02:34:50.948
IS A CRITICAL POINT OF

02:34:51.015 --> 02:34:52.216
REHABILITATION.

02:34:52.282 --> 02:34:54.218
SAN FRANCISCO HAS STEPPED UP TO

02:34:54.284 --> 02:34:56.453
THE PLATE AND PROVIDES RESOURCES

02:34:56.520 --> 02:34:58.222
TO SUPPORT TREATMENT FOR INMATES

02:34:58.288 --> 02:35:00.024
IN OUR COUNTY JAIL BUT THIS

02:35:00.090 --> 02:35:03.193
SUPPORT IS IN SUSTAINABLE AND WE

02:35:03.260 --> 02:35:04.828
JUST CAN'T DO IT ALONE.

02:35:04.895 --> 02:35:07.164
THIS CARE INCLUDES COMPREHENSIVE

02:35:07.231 --> 02:35:09.366
AND INTEGRATED SYSTEMS A MEDICAL

02:35:09.433 --> 02:35:11.035
PSYCHIATRIC AND SUBSTANCE USE

02:35:11.101 --> 02:35:12.469
DISORDERS TREATMENTS WITH THE

02:35:12.536 --> 02:35:15.472
GOAL OF REDUCING THEIR RISK OF

02:35:15.539 --> 02:35:16.707
OVERDOSE.

02:35:16.774 --> 02:35:19.076
THIS DECREASES COSTS ASSOCIATED

02:50:37.160 --> 02:50:39.862
WAS NECESSARY -- BUT HAD AS HIS

02:50:39.929 --> 02:50:41.731
AT HIS INSISTENCE AS A MEDICAL

02:50:41.798 --> 02:50:44.267
PROFESSIONAL I AGREE TO IT --

COVER MYSELF WITH.

02:51:00.683 --> 02:51:02.986
AND HE PROCEEDED TO TELL ME THAT

02:51:03.052 --> 02:51:05.355
HE WOULD NEED -- TO DO A PELVIC

02:51:05.421 --> 02:51:06.923
EXAM TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE

02:51:06.990 --> 02:51:09.392
WERE NO ABNORMALITIES -- SO HE

02:51:09.459 --> 02:51:11.594
DIGITAL DIGITALLY PENETRATED ME

02:51:11.661 --> 02:51:13.396
WITH HIS HAND WITH HIS UNCLE

02:51:13.463 --> 02:51:19.002

02:51:26.275 --> 02:51:27.644
SEVERAL MINUTES HE WAS VERY

02:51:27.710 --> 02:51:32.315
PAINFUL -- I HAD NO IDEA THAT IT

JUST TRYING TO GET THROUGH IT --

02:51:41.758 --> 02:51:43.326
SO I DIDN'T REALIZE.

02:51:43.393 --> 02:51:45.728

I COULD BE A MODEL.

02:51:51.801 --> 02:51:54.137
AND AND THAT HE WAS SURE THAT MY

02:51:54.203 --> 02:51:56.139
MOTHER WAS BEAUTIFUL AS WELL AND

02:51:56.205 --> 02:51:56.873
THAT SHE COULD BE A MODEL AS

02:51:56.939 --> 02:51:57.573
WELL.

02:51:57.640 --> 02:52:02.178
HE ALSO COMMENTED THAT -- MY

02:52:02.245 --> 02:52:03.913
THAT I WAS I MUST BE A RUNNER

02:52:03.980 --> 02:52:06.949
BECAUSE I WAS TIGHT -- AND THEN

02:52:07.016 --> 02:52:09.786
AS HE CONCLUDED THE EXAM.

02:52:09.852 --> 02:52:12.288
HE ASKED IF HE COULD TAKE

02:52:12.355 --> 02:52:16.025
PICTURES -- BECAUSE HE WANTED TO

02:52:16.092 --> 02:52:18.194
USE THE PHOTOS -- FOR RESEARCH

02:52:18.261 --> 02:52:21.497
THAT HE WAS WORKING ON ONE THING

02:52:21.564 --> 02:52:23.099
THAT -- WE ARE PAINFULLY

02:52:23.166 --> 02:52:24.033
LEARNING.

02:52:24.100 --> 02:52:26.169
THROUGH THIS -- CASE IS THAT

02:52:26.235 --> 02:52:27.470
IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO HAVE A

02:52:27.537 --> 02:52:29.105
CHAPERONE IN THE ROOM.

02:52:29.172 --> 02:52:32.275

02:52:34.277 --> 02:52:36.846
CHAPERONES IN THE ROOM -- AND

02:52:36.913 --> 02:52:38.081
WE'RE LEARNING THAT IT'S NOT

02:52:38.147 --> 02:52:39.582

02:56:43.426 --> 02:56:44.927
THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THE RISKS

02:56:44.994 --> 02:56:46.829

02:56:46.896 --> 02:56:49.298
WAY IT SHOULD BE DONE AND SO I

ENROLLMENT.

03:02:20.095 --> 03:02:22.631
AND SO THIS PROPOSAL -- IS -- A

03:02:22.698 --> 03:02:24.800
SMART STRATEGY BY GOING TO WHERE

03:02:24.867 --> 03:02:26.568
LARGE NUMBERS OF CHILDREN LIVE

03:02:30.572 --> 03:02:31.840

03:02:31.907 --> 03:02:33.042
AND SO THIS OFFERS US AN

03:02:33.108 --> 03:02:35.711
OPPORTUNITY TO ENROLL THEM FROM

03:02:35.778 --> 03:02:37.646

AS YOU HEARD IS THAT THEY

QUICKLY AND ROLL THEM INTO MEDI

03:02:44.987 --> 03:02:47.222
CAL AND AS YOU ALSO HEARD -- THE

03:02:47.289 --> 03:02:49.191
THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT WE KNOW

THEIR NUMBERS AND WE'RE NOT.

03:02:55.230 --> 03:02:56.598
IN ROLLING THEM BUT THE GOOD

03:02:56.665 --> 03:02:58.467
NEWS IS THAT WE HAVE A

03:02:58.534 --> 03:03:00.202

CAPABILITY OF DOING THIS ALREADY

04:05:31.349 --> 04:05:32.617
IS THERE SEVERAL PILOT PROJECTS.

04:05:32.684 --> 04:05:34.786
WHY DOES IT?

04:05:34.853 --> 04:05:40.358

HEALTH CARE WORK FORCE PILOT

04:05:47.332 --> 04:05:48.400
PROGRAM.

04:05:48.467 --> 04:05:49.668
OF THE WHOLE FUNCTION OF ALL

04:05:49.734 --> 04:05:51.169
SHIFTED PILOT PROGRAMS IS TO

04:05:51.236 --> 04:05:53.071

IT'S EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT

04:05:56.208 --> 04:05:58.443
THOSE ARE TIME LIMITED PILOTS.

04:05:58.510 --> 04:06:00.745
AND SO THEY HAVE UNDERGONE

04:06:00.812 --> 04:06:02.547
MULTIPLE EXTENSIONS AND I THINK

04:06:02.614 --> 04:06:03.715
THE OFFER DIRECTOR BECAUSE

04:06:03.782 --> 04:06:05.450

MORE YEAR.

04:06:06.418 --> 04:06:08.120
AFTER THE VETO MISTER GIBSON'S

04:06:08.186 --> 04:06:09.988
BILL AND SO WE ARE CONTINUALLY.

A BY HIS SIDE TO NATION'S THE

04:06:11.423 --> 04:06:12.891
FIGHTING TO GET THESE PROGRAMS

04:06:12.958 --> 04:06:14.759
AUTHORIZED STATEWIDE ABSENT THAT

04:06:14.826 --> 04:06:17.629
AUTHORIZATION THOSE PILOTS WILL

04:06:17.696 --> 04:06:19.030
HAVE TO SHUT DOWN BUT DOT BUT

SECOND CONTINUE MISTER CHAIR.

04:06:20.398 --> 04:06:25.403
OF BUT THAT DOESN'T NEED.

04:06:25.470 --> 04:06:26.705
IT DOESN'T AVOID DIDN'T NEED

04:06:26.771 --> 04:06:27.005
[inaudible]

04:06:27.072 --> 04:06:28.707
LEGISLATIVE INTERVENTION -- THAT

04:06:28.773 --> 04:06:31.309
WAS A REGULATORY BODY THAT PLACE.

04:06:31.376 --> 04:06:36.715
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST CONTINUE THIS?

04:06:36.781 --> 04:06:37.516
I THINK I DON'T KNOW WHERE ELSE

04:06:37.582 --> 04:06:38.984
TO GO ON THAT ASKED AND ANSWERED

04:06:39.050 --> 04:06:40.886
THIS IS A A PARAMEDIC WHO IS

04:06:40.952 --> 04:06:42.053
OPERATING.

04:06:42.120 --> 04:06:44.022
IN A DIFFERENT ROLE AS DESCRIBED

04:06:44.089 --> 04:06:46.491
BY THE AUTHOR AND SO THEREFORE.

04:06:46.558 --> 04:06:49.461

MONITORING AND DATA AND

04:06:55.634 --> 04:06:56.868
REPORTING WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE

04:06:56.935 --> 04:06:58.170
THE UCSF STUDIES.

04:06:58.236 --> 04:06:59.671
SUGGESTING HOW EFFECTIVE THESE

04:06:59.738 --> 04:07:01.339
PROGRAMS ARE BECAUSE THERE HAVE

04:07:01.406 --> 04:07:03.008
BEEN ZERO NEGATIVE PATIENT

04:07:03.074 --> 04:07:05.310
OUTCOMES IN ANY OF THE PILOTS

04:07:05.377 --> 04:07:06.178
OVER THE COURSE OF THE FOUR

04:07:06.244 --> 04:07:06.978
YEARS.

04:07:07.045 --> 04:07:08.446
THAT THEY ARE THEN GOING TO RELY

04:07:08.513 --> 04:07:10.682
ON THAT DATA IN AND PRESENT THIS

04:07:10.749 --> 04:07:12.784
TO YOU THE DECISION MAKERS TO

04:07:12.851 --> 04:07:13.818
WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO PASS A

04:07:13.885 --> 04:07:15.120
LAW TO AUTHORIZE THESE PROGRAMS

04:07:15.187 --> 04:07:17.055
PERMANENTLY STATEWIDE OR TO LET

04:07:17.122 --> 04:07:19.791
THEM SUNSET.

04:07:19.858 --> 04:07:21.226
AND MOVE ON TO ANOTHER IDEA.

04:07:21.293 --> 04:07:25.230
SO IS THIS IS THIS.

04:07:25.297 --> 04:07:27.332
WELL -- WHAT WOULD TEND TO BE

04:07:27.399 --> 04:07:29.167
THE NEXT STEP AFTER THIS IF THIS

04:07:29.234 --> 04:07:30.669
WERE TO PASS AND IF THIS COME

04:07:30.735 --> 04:07:33.038
BECOMES LAW?

04:07:33.104 --> 04:07:34.739
THEN WHAT HAPPENS.

04:07:34.806 --> 04:07:36.041
EXCELLENT QUESTION AND AND MAYBE

04:07:36.107 --> 04:07:38.043
IT ALSO ADDRESS SOME OF THE

04:07:38.109 --> 04:07:39.411
COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE IN

04:07:39.477 --> 04:07:41.346
OPPOSITION THAT IS.

04:07:41.413 --> 04:07:43.682
MISTER GIVENS BILL IS OPTIONAL.

04:07:43.748 --> 04:07:45.016
SO TO THE POINT ABOUT.

04:07:45.083 --> 04:07:45.984
POTENTIALLY CREATING A

04:07:46.051 --> 04:07:48.453
FRAGMENTED SYSTEM NOT SO.

04:07:48.520 --> 04:07:51.156
COUNTIES ARE EXCLUSIVELY IN

04:07:51.223 --> 04:07:53.358
CONTROL OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY

04:07:53.425 --> 04:07:55.260
PURSUE A COMMUNITY PARAMEDICS

04:07:55.327 --> 04:07:57.395
SPECIALTY OR ALTER DESTINATION

04:07:57.462 --> 04:08:00.465
SPECIALTY AND WHICH ONE HOW MANY

04:08:00.532 --> 04:08:02.400
AND IT IS THEIR JOB TO THEN

04:08:02.467 --> 04:08:03.635
COLLABORATE WITH ALL OF THE

04:08:03.702 --> 04:08:05.737
SYSTEM STAKEHOLDERS. TO DEVELOP

04:08:05.804 --> 04:08:09.307
THE PROGRAM THAT FITS RIGHT FOR

04:08:09.374 --> 04:08:15.447
THAT COUNTY IN THAT COMMUNITY --

04:08:15.513 --> 04:08:17.816
I I'VE.

04:08:17.882 --> 04:08:19.317
I'VE BEEN RELUCTANT TO SUPPORT

04:08:19.384 --> 04:08:22.420
THIS IN THE PAST -- I STILL HAVE

04:08:22.487 --> 04:08:26.324
CONCERNS WITH THIS.

04:08:26.391 --> 04:08:27.392
ON SEVERAL LEVELS.

04:08:27.459 --> 04:08:29.894
AB.

04:08:29.961 --> 04:08:33.398
ONE I REALLY DON'T KNOW IF.

04:08:33.465 --> 04:08:38.336
SOMEONE IN A PARAMEDIC POSITION --

04:08:38.403 --> 04:08:39.771
AND I'M NOT DISCOUNTING THEIR

04:08:39.838 --> 04:08:42.507
CAPABILITY.

04:08:42.574 --> 04:08:44.809
THE SAVE LIVES BUT IN A

04:08:44.876 --> 04:08:45.944
SITUATION LIKE THIS WHERE YOU

04:08:46.011 --> 04:08:46.945
DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE

04:08:47.012 --> 04:08:48.713
DEALING WITH I DON'T KNOW IF

04:08:48.780 --> 04:08:50.115
THAT TRAINING IS GOING TO BE

04:08:50.181 --> 04:08:51.683
ENOUGH TO ALWAYS.

04:08:51.750 --> 04:08:53.718
ADDRESS SOME ISSUES.

04:08:53.785 --> 04:08:54.753
ABOUT SOME OF THE STUDIES THAT

04:08:54.819 --> 04:08:56.087
HAVE COME OUT HAVEN'T

04:08:56.154 --> 04:08:58.790
NECESSARILY SHOWN.

04:08:58.857 --> 04:08:59.924
ADVERSE OUTCOMES.

04:08:59.991 --> 04:09:04.062
BUT THAT'S ALSO VAN I THINK ON

04:09:04.129 --> 04:09:04.696
STUDIES BASED ON ONLY ABOUT TWO

04:09:04.763 --> 04:09:05.797
YEARS.

04:09:05.864 --> 04:09:08.366
SO I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE

04:09:08.433 --> 04:09:09.968
CASE LOAD HAS BEEN.

04:09:10.035 --> 04:09:11.870
I HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN A LOT OF

04:09:11.936 --> 04:09:13.738
NUMBERS ON THIS SO IT'S PART OF

04:09:13.805 --> 04:09:20.045
MY THAT'S ON ME -- BUT THERE'S

04:09:20.111 --> 04:09:21.980
THAT INHERENT ISSUE THAT KIND OF

04:09:22.047 --> 04:09:24.149
BOTHERS ME BECAUSE YOU DON'T

04:09:24.215 --> 04:09:25.216
WANT TO MISCALCULATE SOMETHING.

04:09:25.283 --> 04:09:26.951
SECOND.

04:09:27.018 --> 04:09:31.556
IT IT'S CREATING ISSUES AMONGST.

04:09:31.623 --> 04:09:32.924
THE LABOR FAMILY THAT I DIDN'T

04:09:32.991 --> 04:09:34.092
REALLY EXPECT [inaudible]

04:09:34.159 --> 04:09:37.429

04:09:37.495 --> 04:09:39.464

04:09:42.801 --> 04:09:44.069
WITH ALL SIDES TO FIGURE OUT HOW

04:09:44.135 --> 04:09:48.173
YOU CAN -- ADDRESS SOME OF THESE

04:09:48.239 --> 04:09:49.808
ONGOING ISSUES BECAUSE I FEEL

04:09:49.874 --> 04:09:51.543

04:09:51.609 --> 04:09:54.145
THERE ARE OUTSIDE PRESSURES.

04:09:54.212 --> 04:09:56.247
SAYING THAT THE COSTS ARE TOO

04:09:56.314 --> 04:09:57.315
MUCH.

04:09:57.382 --> 04:09:59.517
BUT THEN THE ARGUMENT.

04:09:59.584 --> 04:10:01.086
COMES DOWN TO IN BETWEEN FOLKS

04:11:30.141 --> 04:11:32.177
IS A GUNSHOT VICTIM WE TRUST

04:11:32.243 --> 04:11:33.778
THEM WHICH WAS THE NEXT PROBLEM

04:11:33.845 --> 04:11:34.846
MOTHERS OR FATHERS ARE HAVING A

04:11:34.913 --> 04:11:37.115
HEART ATTACK OR STROKE WE TRUST

SOMEONE IS HAVING A MENTAL

BREAKDOWN OR SUICIDAL TENDENCIES

04:11:50.895 --> 04:11:52.564
THAT SO THEY WON'T HAVE TO SIT

04:11:52.630 --> 04:11:53.231
INTO EMERGENCY ROOM.

04:11:53.298 --> 04:11:55.200
BUT THEY'LL BE TRANSPORTED TO A

04:11:55.266 --> 04:11:56.935
BEHAVIOR HEALTH FACILITY SO THEY

04:11:57.001 --> 04:11:59.237

AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE HERE

04:12:03.975 --> 04:12:05.844
TODAY WITH FIFTEEN FORTY FOUR WE

DEATH.

04:12:20.225 --> 04:12:21.025
SO THIS BILL DEMONSTRATES THAT

04:12:21.092 --> 04:12:22.427
THAT SAME KIND OF TRUSTS.

04:12:22.494 --> 04:12:23.428

I'M REALLY TORN ABOUT THIS ISSUE

04:12:33.872 --> 04:12:35.573
BECAUSE WE'VE HAD THIS

04:12:35.640 --> 04:12:36.875
DISCUSSION LAST YEAR.

04:12:36.941 --> 04:12:39.077
ON THE ISSUES REGARDING THE

04:12:39.143 --> 04:12:41.846
ALTERNATE DESTINATIONS -- BUT I

04:12:41.913 --> 04:12:43.448
THINK LOOKING BACK IN.

04:12:43.515 --> 04:12:45.416
MY CAR OF OVER THIRTY YEARS

04:12:45.483 --> 04:12:47.085
WORKING THE EMS INDUSTRY.

04:12:47.151 --> 04:12:48.553
I'VE ALWAYS TAUGHT WE DON'T

04:12:48.620 --> 04:12:50.288
DIAGNOSE RIGHT SO SOMETIME I

04:12:50.355 --> 04:12:51.422
HAVE A HEART ISSUE ONE WERE.

04:12:51.489 --> 04:12:52.957
ASKING OUR PARAMEDICS TO MAKE

04:12:53.024 --> 04:12:54.592
THAT DECISION WHERE WE TAKE

04:12:54.659 --> 04:12:57.028
SOMEBODY TO EMERGENCY ROOM OR TO

04:12:57.095 --> 04:12:59.364
A NON EMERGENT CENTER -- BECAUSE

04:12:59.430 --> 04:13:00.798
THEY COULD BE SOMEBODY SUFFERING

04:13:00.865 --> 04:13:02.934
FROM A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS OR

04:13:03.001 --> 04:13:04.736
COULD BE INTOXICATED.

04:13:04.802 --> 04:13:06.471
AND SOMETIMES I JUST FEEL TORN

04:13:06.538 --> 04:13:07.205
THAT.

04:13:07.272 --> 04:13:08.907
WE'RE NOT DOCTORS AS PARAMEDICS

04:13:08.973 --> 04:13:10.074
RIGHT WERE WERE NOT THERE TO

04:13:10.141 --> 04:13:11.743
DIAGNOSE THAT THIS PERSON HAS

04:13:11.809 --> 04:13:12.777
THIS CONDITION IS THAT CONDITION

04:13:12.844 --> 04:13:14.512
WE'RE TRYING TO DO WHAT'S BEST

04:13:14.579 --> 04:13:16.147
FOR THE PATIENT.

04:13:16.214 --> 04:13:17.015
I GET IT WE'RE TRYING TO

04:13:17.081 --> 04:13:18.216
ALLEVIATE THE CONGESTION IN

04:13:18.283 --> 04:13:19.851
HOSPITALS BECAUSE MANY THESE

04:13:19.918 --> 04:13:21.185
PATIENT DON'T NEED TO BE THAT WE

04:13:21.252 --> 04:13:22.854
WE GET IT IF THEY WOULD JUST

04:13:22.921 --> 04:13:24.489
FALL WITH THEIR DOCTORS AND DO

04:13:24.556 --> 04:13:25.890
THE MINOR THINGS THAT WOULDN'T

04:13:25.957 --> 04:13:26.891
BE A LOT IN THE E. ARE SITTING

04:13:26.958 --> 04:13:27.992
BUT THAT'S KIND OF SOMETHING.

04:13:28.059 --> 04:13:30.428
WE'RE GOING -- TO BUT MY BIGGEST

04:13:30.495 --> 04:13:32.397
ISSUE I'M HAVING AS THE POST

04:13:32.463 --> 04:13:34.632
DISCHARGE WHEN SOMEBODY IS BEING

04:13:34.699 --> 04:13:35.900
DISCHARGED FROM HOSPITAL.

04:13:35.967 --> 04:13:38.536
SOMEBODY WITH HOSPICE CARE.

04:13:38.603 --> 04:13:41.472

04:13:41.539 --> 04:13:43.641
PARAMEDIC AS AS YOU ALLUDED TO

04:13:43.708 --> 04:13:44.742

PEOPLE'S LIVES IN AND I GET THAT.

04:13:49.247 --> 04:13:50.815
BUT SOMETIMES I FEEL THAT THAT

04:13:50.882 --> 04:13:51.516
COULD BE AN ISSUE WITH.

04:13:51.583 --> 04:13:53.251
OUR NURSES RIGHT BECAUSE TO ME.

04:13:53.318 --> 04:13:53.718
I'M NOT HERE.

04:13:53.785 --> 04:13:55.753
TO PICK SIDES BUT JUST LOOKING

04:13:55.820 --> 04:13:59.190
AT THE OVERALL ASPECT OF OF THE

04:13:59.257 --> 04:14:01.893
PROFESSION A PARAMEDIC AND NURSE

04:14:01.960 --> 04:14:03.661
THE NURSE INNOCENCE IS THE

04:14:03.728 --> 04:14:04.662
HIGHER MEDICAL AUTHORITY.

04:14:04.729 --> 04:14:06.097
BECAUSE THAT MORE TRAINING MORE

04:14:06.164 --> 04:14:09.767
EDUCATION. TO SEE THAT THAT TYPE

04:14:09.834 --> 04:14:11.135
OF PATIENT.

04:14:11.202 --> 04:14:12.337
GETTING THE TREE WITH THE FOLLOW

04:14:12.403 --> 04:14:14.405
UP CARE THAT SOMETIMES HARD FOR

04:14:14.472 --> 04:14:16.541
ME. TO TO TO THE GRAPHS THAT THE

04:14:16.608 --> 04:14:18.009
PARAMEDIC IS BETTER THAN THE

04:14:18.076 --> 04:14:21.112
NURSE BECAUSE THE NURSES USUALLY

04:14:21.179 --> 04:14:21.646
WHAT THEY NORMALLY DO THEY

04:14:21.713 --> 04:14:24.282
FOLLOW UP -- WITH PATIENTS ONCE

04:14:24.349 --> 04:14:24.782
THEY'RE DISCHARGED FROM

04:14:24.849 --> 04:14:25.917
HOSPITALS.

04:14:25.984 --> 04:14:27.785
SO I'M I'M KIND OF TRANSFER TO

04:14:27.852 --> 04:14:29.053
HOW THIS WOULD WORK.

04:14:29.120 --> 04:14:30.288
I LIKE A BIT THAT IT WOULD BE

04:14:30.355 --> 04:14:32.290
IT'S NOT MANDATORY ITS REGULAR

04:14:32.357 --> 04:14:33.091
FOR EVERY COUNTY OR CITY TO DO

04:14:33.157 --> 04:14:34.792
IT'S IT'S AN OPTION WHICH WHICH

04:14:34.859 --> 04:14:36.561
I LIKE THAT BUT I JUST DON'T

04:14:36.628 --> 04:14:38.029
KNOW HOW THE HOW THE AGENCIES.

04:14:38.096 --> 04:14:39.597
WORK TOGETHER WITH OUR NURSES

04:14:39.664 --> 04:14:42.867
RIGHT IS THAT SOMETHING THAT.

04:14:42.934 --> 04:14:44.802
WE ARE EXCLUDING THE NURSES FROM

04:14:44.869 --> 04:14:46.004
DOING THEIR JOB THAT WE HAVE IN

04:14:46.070 --> 04:14:47.171
A PARAMEDIC DOING THAT OR I KNOW

04:14:47.238 --> 04:14:48.006
DEPARTMENTS ARE WORKING WITH

04:14:48.072 --> 04:14:49.641
NURSES TOGETHER TO PROVIDE THAT

04:14:49.707 --> 04:14:51.743
SERVICE.

04:14:51.809 --> 04:14:52.677
CAN SOMEBODY ELABORATE TO ME ON

04:14:52.744 --> 04:14:56.614
THAT ASPECT OF THE CARE.

04:14:56.681 --> 04:14:57.882
I CAN SPEAK TO MY EXPERIENCE

04:14:57.949 --> 04:14:59.484
JUST -- IN THE WITH A POST

04:14:59.550 --> 04:15:00.985
DISCHARGE FEEL BECAUSE I WAS ONE

04:15:01.052 --> 04:15:01.886
OF THE THINGS WE LOOKED AT SO

04:15:01.953 --> 04:15:03.054
AGAIN BACK TO THE POINT THAT I

04:15:03.121 --> 04:15:04.422
MADE -- EARLIER WE'RE NOT

04:15:04.489 --> 04:15:05.857
REPLICATING SERVICES WERE NOT

04:15:05.923 --> 04:15:07.458
ACTING OUTSIDE OF OUR PROTOCOLS

04:15:07.525 --> 04:15:08.760
WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE BEHOLDEN

04:15:08.826 --> 04:15:10.028
TO ALL THE SAME PROTOCOL SO WE

04:15:10.094 --> 04:15:12.130
ARE WE'RE WORKING IN AND THEN I

04:15:12.196 --> 04:15:12.797
WANT CAPACITY.

04:15:12.864 --> 04:15:13.698
PROBABLY ALSO WORTH NOTING TO

04:15:13.765 --> 04:15:14.999
THAT IN MY POSITION RIGHT NOW

04:15:15.066 --> 04:15:16.200
I'M NOT I'M NOT PART OF

04:15:16.267 --> 04:15:18.436
SUPPRESSION THEY TOOK ME OFF OFF

04:15:18.503 --> 04:15:19.570
THE SUPPRESSION LINE I'M WORKING

04:15:19.637 --> 04:15:21.706
IN THE ADMIN POSITIONS WITH THE

04:15:21.773 --> 04:15:23.007
FORTY HOUR WORK WEEK MONDAY

04:15:23.074 --> 04:15:24.942
THROUGH THURSDAY -- THE TEN HOUR

04:15:25.009 --> 04:15:26.811
DAYS SO -- REALISTICALLY WHAT

04:15:26.878 --> 04:15:27.879
HAPPENS WHEN WE GO AND VISIT

04:15:27.945 --> 04:15:28.413
PEOPLE AFTER THEY'VE BEEN

04:15:28.479 --> 04:15:30.648
DISCHARGED AGAIN A LOT OF TIMES

04:15:30.715 --> 04:15:32.283
THESE ARE FOLKS THAT DON'T HAVE

04:15:32.350 --> 04:15:33.751
FAMILY MEMBERS TO HELP NOT WITH

04:15:33.818 --> 04:15:35.286
THE WITH THE YOU KNOW MEDICATION

04:15:35.353 --> 04:15:37.655
PICK UPS OR TO FOLLOW DOCTOR

04:15:37.722 --> 04:15:40.058
VISITS THINGS LIKE THAT -- SO

04:15:40.124 --> 04:15:41.092
WE'LL BE FOR WHAT WE DO WHAT WE

04:15:41.159 --> 04:15:41.659
DO IS WE WE FILL THESE GAPS

04:15:41.726 --> 04:15:42.393
AGAIN.

04:15:42.460 --> 04:15:43.361
THERE'S THERE'S A GAP THAT THAT

04:15:43.428 --> 04:15:44.328
HAPPENS NATURALLY BETWEEN WHEN A

04:15:44.395 --> 04:15:45.730
PATIENT IS DISCHARGED HOME TO

04:15:45.797 --> 04:15:47.131
WIN HOME HEALTH SERVICES START

04:15:47.198 --> 04:15:48.066
WHAT WE ATTEMPT TO DO IN THAT

04:15:48.132 --> 04:15:50.068
INTERIM IS BASICALLY MAKE SURE

04:15:50.134 --> 04:15:51.035
THAT THEY'RE SET UP FOR SUCCESS.

04:15:51.102 --> 04:15:52.503
SO IF THEY IF THEY HAVE DISTRICT

04:15:52.570 --> 04:15:54.238
MEDICATIONS UNFORTUNATELY OUR

04:15:54.305 --> 04:15:55.740
HOSPITAL IN ALAMEDA DOES NOT

04:15:55.807 --> 04:15:56.340
HAVE A DISCHARGE PHARMACY SO

04:15:56.407 --> 04:15:58.743
PEOPLE ARE REQUIRED TO PICK THEM

04:15:58.810 --> 04:15:59.911
UP ON THEIR OWN OR HAVE SOMEONE

04:15:59.977 --> 04:16:01.179
PICK THEM UP ON THEIR BEHALF --

04:16:01.245 --> 04:16:02.480
SO WHAT WE DO IS WE MAKE SURE

04:16:02.547 --> 04:16:03.381
THEY HAVE THE DISCHARGE

04:16:03.448 --> 04:16:04.382
MEDICATIONS THAT THEY WERE

04:16:04.449 --> 04:16:05.283
SUPPOSED TO HAVE.

04:16:05.349 --> 04:16:06.350
ENSURE THAT THERE THAT THEY KNOW

04:16:06.417 --> 04:16:07.985
THAT THEY YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE

04:16:08.052 --> 04:16:08.619
SUPPOSED TO HAVE AN THAT THEY'RE

04:16:08.686 --> 04:16:09.554
TAKING IMPROPERLY.

04:16:09.620 --> 04:16:10.788
AND THEN BASICALLY MAKING SURE

04:16:10.855 --> 04:16:12.223
THEY'RE FOLLOWING UP AND LIKE I

04:16:12.290 --> 04:16:14.292
SAID TO OFTENTIMES ON THE ON

04:16:14.358 --> 04:16:15.793
MAKING FOLLOW UP CALLS TO THE

04:16:15.860 --> 04:16:16.794
HOME HEALTH AGENCIES THAT HAVE

04:16:16.861 --> 04:16:17.462
BEEN ASSIGNED TO THESE FOLKS. TO

04:16:17.528 --> 04:16:18.463
MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE

04:16:18.529 --> 04:16:20.164
FOLLOWING UP THAT THEY ARE GOING

04:16:20.231 --> 04:16:21.466
TO COME IN I'M NOT THERE TO DO

04:16:21.532 --> 04:16:22.400
THE THINGS THAT THE NURSE THAT'S

04:16:22.467 --> 04:16:23.501
ASSIGNED TO THAT PERSON.

04:16:23.568 --> 04:16:25.703
IS DOING I'M SIMPLY THERE AGAIN

04:16:25.770 --> 04:16:27.171
TO BRIDGE THIS GAP TO HOPEFULLY

04:16:27.238 --> 04:16:28.272
ENSURE THAT THIS PERSON DOES NOT

04:16:28.339 --> 04:16:29.607
GO BACK TO THE HOSPITAL FOR

04:16:29.674 --> 04:16:30.241
SOMETHING THAT COULD HAVE EASILY

04:16:30.308 --> 04:16:31.209
BEEN AVOIDED.

04:16:31.275 --> 04:16:33.878
BY SIMPLY TAKING A MEDICATION OR

04:16:33.945 --> 04:16:35.079
MAKING A FOLLOW UP CALL OR IN IN

04:16:35.146 --> 04:16:42.320

SO.

04:16:46.891 --> 04:16:48.059
I THINK A LOT MORE CLEAR YEAH

04:16:48.126 --> 04:16:48.860
MAKES LEVEL MORE SENSE SO WE'RE

04:16:48.926 --> 04:16:49.794
NOT ACTUALLY TAKING.

04:16:49.861 --> 04:16:51.229
A UNIT THAT'S PRIMARILY ORDERED

04:16:51.295 --> 04:16:53.030

04:17:00.438 --> 04:17:02.106
I I GET THAT I FEEL A BIT MORE

04:17:02.173 --> 04:17:04.075
COMFORTABLE WITH THAT -- BUT

04:17:04.142 --> 04:17:05.476
ALSO WANTED TO COLLABORATE MORE

04:17:05.543 --> 04:17:07.378
ON THE OPPOSITION TALKED ABOUT

04:17:07.445 --> 04:17:09.046

THOSE PUBLIC PROGRAMS ADDRESS

04:17:25.196 --> 04:17:25.763
THOSE ISSUES WHY THAT HAPPENED

04:17:25.830 --> 04:17:27.098
IN MAKING SURE THAT.

04:17:27.165 --> 04:17:27.665
THE OUTCOMES ARE BETTER THAN

WITH WHAT THE OPPOSITION.

04:17:43.281 --> 04:17:45.616
THAT THE READMISSION RATES DID

04:17:45.683 --> 04:17:47.084
NOT CHANGE AND SOME TASTE CASES

04:17:47.151 --> 04:17:48.386
THAT INCREASED AND THEY ARE

04:17:48.452 --> 04:17:49.787
FOCUSED ON COMPLEX.

04:17:49.854 --> 04:17:51.856
MEDICAL ISSUES AND SO WHAT

04:17:51.923 --> 04:17:52.957

REVIEWED THE PROTOCOLS IN

04:17:59.664 --> 04:18:00.731
DETERMINED THAT THE PROTOCOLS

04:18:00.798 --> 04:18:01.833
WHEN APPROPRIATE THE SHOULD HAVE

04:18:01.899 --> 04:18:03.935
BEEN MAKING AN IN PERSON VISIT

SAFETY CONCERNS RELATED TO THE

04:30:06.456 --> 04:30:07.591
DELIVERY OF FOOD.

04:30:07.658 --> 04:30:09.026
FIRST LET ME SAY THAT FOOD

04:30:09.092 --> 04:30:10.427
SAFETY AND CUSTOMER TRUST AND

04:30:10.494 --> 04:30:12.262
SAFETY IS A TOP PRIORITY FOR

04:30:12.329 --> 04:30:13.497

RETAIL AND GROCERY PARTNERS.

04:30:16.967 --> 04:30:18.335
THEY HAVE IMPLEMENTED FOOD AT

RISK BASED FOOD SAFETY MEASURES

04:30:19.703 --> 04:30:21.738
APPROPRIATE FOR THE POTENTIAL

04:30:21.805 --> 04:30:23.540
FOOD SAFETY RISKS.

04:30:23.607 --> 04:30:24.675
I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO STATE THAT

04:30:24.741 --> 04:30:26.176
WE BELIEVE IS CONVERSATIONS ARE

04:30:26.243 --> 04:30:27.477
CONTINUING TO DEVELOP REGARDING

04:30:27.544 --> 04:30:29.313
WORKER CLASSIFICATION BILLS LIKE

04:30:29.379 --> 04:30:30.781
THESE CREATE CONFLICT AND

04:30:30.847 --> 04:30:32.316
CONFUSION THAT WILL NOT HELP IN

04:30:32.382 --> 04:30:33.550
COMING TO A SOLUTION TO THOSE

04:30:33.617 --> 04:30:34.918
CONVERSATIONS.

04:30:34.985 --> 04:30:35.752
THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE

COMPANIES TO RE ENGINEER THEIR

04:30:37.421 --> 04:30:39.156
PLATFORMS AND EXERT MORE CONTROL

04:30:39.222 --> 04:30:40.791
OVER THEIR DRIVERS WHICH COULD

04:30:40.857 --> 04:30:43.727
PUT THESE COMPANIES IN CONFLICT

04:30:43.794 --> 04:30:44.328
WITH CURRENT CALIFORNIA LABOR

04:30:44.394 --> 04:30:44.828
LAWS.

04:30:44.895 --> 04:30:46.096
AB THIRTEEN SIXTY SINGLES OUT

04:30:46.163 --> 04:30:47.631
THE CALIFORNIA GROCERY INDUSTRY

04:30:47.698 --> 04:30:49.933
IN CRATES POTENTIAL UNNECESSARY

04:30:50.000 --> 04:30:51.535
REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS THAT

04:30:51.602 --> 04:30:52.436
COULD REDUCE THE EARNING

04:30:52.502 --> 04:30:53.503
POTENTIAL OF MILLIONS OF

04:30:53.570 --> 04:30:55.739
CALIFORNIANS AND NEGATIVELY

04:30:55.806 --> 04:30:57.040
IMPACT SMALL BUSINESSES.

04:30:57.107 --> 04:30:58.375
LET ME JUST QUICKLY EXPLAIN HOW

04:30:58.442 --> 04:31:00.110
THESE PLATFORMS WORK THERE ARE

04:31:00.177 --> 04:31:02.079
TWO BASIC MODELS FIRST FOR MANY

04:31:02.145 --> 04:31:03.480
GROCERY DELIVERY ORDERS A

04:31:03.547 --> 04:31:04.781
CUSTOMER SUBMITS AN ORDER THE

04:31:04.848 --> 04:31:05.882
GROCERY STORE AND A GROCERY

04:31:05.949 --> 04:31:07.584
STORE EMPLOYEE ASSEMBLES THE

04:31:07.651 --> 04:31:09.086
ORDER THAN A DRIVER.

04:31:09.152 --> 04:31:10.687
WORKING ON THE PLATFORM PICKS UP

04:31:10.754 --> 04:31:11.955
THE ORDER AND DELIVERS IT TO THE

04:31:12.022 --> 04:31:15.125
CUSTOMER THE DRIVER NEVER

04:31:15.192 --> 04:31:16.159
TOUCHES ARE HANDLES THE FOOD.

04:31:16.226 --> 04:31:17.628
I CAN'T FOR OTHER ORDERS A

04:31:17.694 --> 04:31:19.129
SHOPPER GOES THE GROCERY STORE

04:31:19.196 --> 04:31:20.364
PICKS UP THE GROCERIES IN THE

04:31:20.430 --> 04:31:21.865
SAME WAY A CUSTOMER DOES AND

04:31:21.932 --> 04:31:23.700
THEN DIRECTLY DELIVERS THE

04:31:23.767 --> 04:31:25.335
GROCERIES TO THE CUSTOMERS. FOR

04:31:25.402 --> 04:31:27.270
THESE ORDERS A SHOPPER ACTS

04:31:27.337 --> 04:31:28.805
EXACTLY LIKE A CUSTOMER WOULD

04:31:28.872 --> 04:31:30.007
GOING TO GROCERY STORE PICKING

04:31:30.073 --> 04:31:31.742
OUT YOUR PRODUCE PICKING OUT

04:31:31.808 --> 04:31:33.377

04:31:33.443 --> 04:31:34.878
SHIPS AND THEN PAYING FOR YOUR

04:31:34.945 --> 04:31:36.446
GROCERIES AND TRANSPORTING THEM

04:31:36.513 --> 04:31:37.681
TO THE CUSTOMER'S HOME.

04:31:37.748 --> 04:31:38.815
SO FOR THE PROVISIONS OF THE

04:31:38.882 --> 04:31:40.017
BILL THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE

04:31:40.083 --> 04:31:41.485

THE PROCESS OF GETTING A FOOD

04:31:52.562 --> 04:31:54.164
HANDLER CARD IS BURDENSOME BOTH

04:31:54.231 --> 04:31:56.033

FEW HOURS A WEEK.

04:31:59.870 --> 04:32:01.705
THE AVERAGE IS USUALLY ABOUT

04:32:01.772 --> 04:32:03.373
THREE TO FIVE HOURS A WEEK -- IT

04:32:03.440 --> 04:32:04.741
REQUIRES TAKING A NINETY MINUTE

04:32:04.808 --> 04:32:06.276

04:32:16.586 --> 04:32:17.721
WORKERS AT RESTAURANTS AND OTHER

04:32:17.788 --> 04:32:19.156
ESTABLISHMENTS WHERE FOOD IS

04:32:19.222 --> 04:32:20.724
BEING PREPARED AND SERVED WHICH

04:32:20.791 --> 04:32:22.926

RESEARCH THAT HAVE MADE

04:57:23.158 --> 04:57:27.396
FERTILITY TREATMENTS EASIER AND

04:57:27.462 --> 04:57:29.131
MORE SUCCESSFUL.

04:57:29.198 --> 04:57:29.631
WHEN I FIRST STARTED FOR

THE HORMONE INJECTIONS WERE

04:57:31.600 --> 04:57:32.434
DIFFERENT THE PROCESS WAS

04:57:32.501 --> 04:57:33.702
DIFFERENT.

04:57:33.769 --> 04:57:35.537
TODAY TREATMENT IS MORE TAILORED

ALL OF THESE ADVANCES IN

04:57:45.614 --> 04:57:47.015
TREATMENT ARE DUE TO ADVANCE

04:57:47.082 --> 04:57:48.417

04:58:43.071 --> 04:58:44.306
AS I WORKED WITH PATIENTS

04:58:44.373 --> 04:58:45.874
UNDERGOING THESE PROCEDURES FOR

04:58:45.941 --> 04:58:47.576
OVER THIRTY YEARS I CAN SPEAK

04:58:47.643 --> 04:58:48.977

POTENTIAL RISKS.

04:58:51.647 --> 04:58:53.749
AND HOW TO MINIMIZE THESE RISKS

04:58:53.815 --> 04:58:55.284
ADDITIONALLY THE RESEARCH I DO

04:58:55.350 --> 04:58:57.319
ON A DAILY BASIS HAS CLEARED

04:58:57.386 --> 04:58:59.254
DIRECT AND POTENTIALLY IMMEDIATE

04:58:59.321 --> 04:59:00.989

PATIENTS.

04:59:03.725 --> 04:59:04.793
AND I KNOW THAT WITHOUT

04:59:04.860 --> 04:59:06.762
COMPENSATION WE CANNOT OBTAIN --

04:59:06.828 --> 04:59:08.697
SITES TO DO THE RESEARCH THAT

04:59:08.764 --> 04:59:10.732
ONE DAY WILL IMPROVE MEDICAL

04:59:10.799 --> 04:59:11.800
CARE FOR WOMEN.

04:59:11.867 --> 04:59:13.568
OVARIAN STIMULATION AND SITE

04:59:13.635 --> 04:59:15.237
RETRIEVAL IS A TIME CONSUMING

04:59:15.304 --> 04:59:17.506
AND ARDUOUS PROCESS THE TIME

04:59:17.572 --> 04:59:18.707
COMMITMENT FOR ONE ASSISTED

04:59:18.774 --> 04:59:20.042

04:59:20.108 --> 04:59:22.678
ESTIMATED AT FIFTY SIX HOURS.

04:59:22.744 --> 04:59:24.146
AND INCLUDES MEDICAL SCREENING

04:59:28.183 --> 04:59:29.384
MEDICAL PROCEDURES.

04:59:29.451 --> 04:59:30.552
THE ETHICS COMMITTEE OF THE

04:59:30.619 --> 04:59:32.087
AMERICAN SOCIETY OF REPRODUCTIVE

04:59:32.154 --> 04:59:33.355
MEDICINE HAS CONSIDERED THE

04:59:33.422 --> 04:59:35.624
ISSUE OF COMPENSATION FOR DONORS.

04:59:35.691 --> 04:59:36.925
AND HAS COME TO THE CONCLUSION

04:59:36.992 --> 04:59:39.728
THAT COMPENSATION IS WARRANTED

04:59:39.795 --> 04:59:41.029
AND ETHICAL.

04:59:41.096 --> 04:59:42.164
OUR ANALYSIS OF COMPENSATION

04:59:42.230 --> 04:59:44.866
DOES NOT CHANGE DEPENDING ON THE

04:59:44.933 --> 04:59:46.034
AND USE OF THE DONATION WHETHER

04:59:46.101 --> 04:59:48.070
TO HELP CREATE A FAMILY OR TO BE

04:59:48.136 --> 04:59:49.771
USED IN RESEARCH WHICH

04:59:49.838 --> 04:59:51.640
ULTIMATELY MAY HELP MILLIONS.

04:59:51.707 --> 04:59:53.675
BUT IN CALIFORNIA COMPENSATION

04:59:53.742 --> 04:59:55.410
IS PROHIBITED ESSENTIALLY

04:59:55.477 --> 04:59:56.978
CLOSING OFF RESEARCH THAT COULD

04:59:57.045 --> 04:59:58.880
OTHERWISE BE DONE BY OUR WORLD

05:00:01.917 --> 05:00:03.752
WE ARE ONE OF ONLY THREE STATES

05:00:03.819 --> 05:00:05.153
THAT HAS SUCH A BAN.

05:00:15.697 --> 05:00:17.466
ADDITIONALLY EVERY MEDICAL

PROCEDURE COMES AT WITH SOME

05:00:19.401 --> 05:00:20.736
LEVEL OF RISK.

05:00:20.802 --> 05:00:22.471
OVARIAN STIMULATION RETRIEVAL

05:00:22.537 --> 05:00:23.939
ARE STANDARD MEDICAL PROCEDURES

05:00:24.005 --> 05:00:28.009
THAT HAVE BEEN UTILIZED FOR OVER

05:00:28.076 --> 05:00:29.111
THIRTY YEARS AND IN THE LAST

05:00:29.177 --> 05:00:29.611
YEAR THIS PROCEDURE WAS

05:00:29.678 --> 05:00:31.246
PERFORMED OVER ONE POINT FIVE

STRATEGIES ARE THOUGHT TO ALL

05:00:35.550 --> 05:00:36.918
BUT ELIMINATE THE COMPLICATION

05:00:36.985 --> 05:00:38.620
OF OVARIAN HYPER STIMULATION

REASSURING.

05:00:43.358 --> 05:00:44.559
AND THERE APPEARS TO BE NO

05:00:44.626 --> 05:00:46.395
SIGNIFICANT INCREASED RISK FOR

FROM UNDUE RISK AN INFLUENCE.

05:01:02.411 --> 05:01:04.146
IT IS ALSO THE JOB OF THESE

05:01:04.212 --> 05:01:05.147
REVIEW BOARDS TO SET

05:01:08.250 --> 05:01:09.684
THERE IS NO REASON THAT THIS

05:01:09.751 --> 05:01:11.987
ESTABLISHED POLICY OF OVERSIGHT

05:01:12.053 --> 05:01:13.822

05:01:30.639 --> 05:01:32.274
LASTLY IT IS IMPORTANT TO

05:01:32.340 --> 05:01:34.309
UNDERSTAND THE NEED -- FOR SITES

05:01:34.376 --> 05:01:36.578
FOR RESEARCH IN ADDITION TO USE

05:01:36.645 --> 05:01:38.280
AND STEM CELL RESEARCH THERE IS

05:01:38.346 --> 05:01:40.015
A NEED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND

05:01:42.684 --> 05:01:44.519
AND A VERY AN AGING IMPROVING

05:01:44.586 --> 05:01:45.287
OUR KNOWLEGE ABOUT THE

05:01:45.353 --> 05:01:47.088
OVERSIGHT MAY IMPROVE TREATMENT

05:01:47.155 --> 05:01:48.457
FOR INFERTILITY AND ALLOW

05:01:48.523 --> 05:01:49.691
PROTECTION OF THE FREE FROM

05:01:49.758 --> 05:01:53.028
TOXIC EFFECTS OF CHEMOTHERAPY.

05:01:53.094 --> 05:01:56.765
THANK YOU.

05:01:56.832 --> 05:01:58.366
GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND

05:01:58.433 --> 05:01:59.534
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE.

05:01:59.601 --> 05:02:01.470
MY NAME IS NOT CRYSTAL OFF AND I

05:02:01.536 --> 05:02:03.171
AM CO OF OF IT RESEARCH THANK

05:02:03.238 --> 05:02:04.005
YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TO

05:02:04.072 --> 05:02:05.774
TESTIFY TODAY ON THE IMPORTANCE

05:02:05.841 --> 05:02:07.476
OF INCREASING ACCESS TO OTHER

05:02:07.542 --> 05:02:10.212
SITES -- FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES.

05:02:10.278 --> 05:02:11.680
I BELIEVE THERE IS VERY BIG

05:02:11.746 --> 05:02:12.514
POTENTIAL TO MAKE ASSISTED

05:02:12.581 --> 05:02:13.915
REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGIES MUCH

05:02:13.982 --> 05:02:15.617
EASIER MUCH HEALTHIER AND MUCH

05:02:15.684 --> 05:02:17.252
MORE AFFORDABLE FOR MANY

05:02:17.319 --> 05:02:18.153
MILLIONS OF WOMEN THROUGHOUT THE

05:02:18.220 --> 05:02:18.820
WORLD.

05:02:18.887 --> 05:02:20.222
I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

05:02:20.288 --> 05:02:21.690
EXPLAIN WHY THANK ADOPTING THIS

05:02:21.756 --> 05:02:24.059
LAWS IMPORTANT TO THAT.

05:02:24.125 --> 05:02:25.894
THERE ARE OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY

05:02:25.961 --> 05:02:27.095
THOUSAND CASE OF CASES OF IN

05:02:27.162 --> 05:02:28.363
VITRO FERTILIZATION OCCURRING

05:02:28.430 --> 05:02:30.465
PER YEAR IN THE U. S. COSTING ON

05:02:30.532 --> 05:02:31.933
AVERAGE TEN TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND

05:02:32.000 --> 05:02:32.868
DOLLAR PER PROCEDURE.

05:02:32.934 --> 05:02:34.336
AND USUALLY BEING PAID DIRECTLY

05:02:34.402 --> 05:02:36.071
BY THE PATIENT.

05:02:36.137 --> 05:02:37.339
RIGHT NOW PATIENTS MYSELF IN

05:02:37.405 --> 05:02:38.707
JACK'S TEN FIFTEEN HORMONE

05:02:38.773 --> 05:02:40.275
INJECTIONS BEFORE THEY'RE ABLE

05:02:40.342 --> 05:02:41.476
TO DO THE PROCEDURE.

05:02:41.543 --> 05:02:42.477
THESE INJECTIONS CAN BE

05:02:42.544 --> 05:02:44.346
UNPLEASANT RESULTING AND USUALLY

05:02:44.412 --> 05:02:45.814
AND USUALLY UNCOMFORTABLE

05:02:45.881 --> 05:02:47.649
BLOATING AND SWELLING.

05:02:47.716 --> 05:02:48.750
BUT THERE'S CLEAR PROMISE TO

05:02:48.817 --> 05:02:49.951
DEVELOP A WAY WHERE MOST WOMEN

05:02:50.018 --> 05:02:51.152
WOULD NOT REQUIRE THESE HORMONE

05:02:51.219 --> 05:02:52.888
INJECTIONS IF WE FURTHER DEVELOP

05:02:52.954 --> 05:02:54.322
PROMISING RESEARCH.

05:02:54.389 --> 05:02:55.557
THE ORGANIZATION I RUN IS A

05:02:55.624 --> 05:02:57.092
RESEARCH ORGANIZATION THAT'S

05:02:57.158 --> 05:02:58.460
TRYING TO DEVELOP THE WAY FOR

05:02:58.527 --> 05:02:59.995
WOMEN TO NOT NEED HORMONE

05:03:00.061 --> 05:03:01.396
INJECTIONS PRIOR TO DOING IVF.

05:03:01.463 --> 05:03:03.064
AND RIGHT NOW IT'S FAR TOO HARD

05:03:03.131 --> 05:03:04.499
TO DO OUR RESEARCH IN CALIFORNIA

05:03:04.566 --> 05:03:05.800
BECAUSE WE CAN'T GET ACCESS TO

05:03:05.867 --> 05:03:07.702
THE NEEDED TO SHE IS. TO TEST

05:03:07.769 --> 05:03:08.737
OUR WORK WE NEED TO WORK WITH

05:03:08.803 --> 05:03:09.971
EGGS THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN

05:03:10.038 --> 05:03:11.673
EXPOSED TO HORMONE INJECTIONS

05:03:11.740 --> 05:03:12.541
AND WE CAN'T JUST GET -- SITES

05:03:12.607 --> 05:03:13.975
LEFT OVER FROM FERTILITY

05:03:14.042 --> 05:03:14.776
TREATMENTS AS THEY'VE BEEN

05:03:14.843 --> 05:03:16.278
EXPOSED THE MEDICATIONS WERE

05:03:16.344 --> 05:03:17.612
TRYING TO AVOID.

05:03:17.679 --> 05:03:18.446
THE ONLY WAY TO OBTAIN THE

05:03:18.513 --> 05:03:19.948
NEEDED TISSUES IS TO COMPENSATE

05:03:20.015 --> 05:03:21.182
WOMEN FOR THEIR PARTICIPATION

05:03:21.249 --> 05:03:23.351
AND DONATIONS CYCLES.

05:03:23.418 --> 05:03:25.387
WITHOUT ACCESS TO EX WE CAN'T

05:03:25.453 --> 05:03:26.555
DEVELOP THIS RESEARCH AND

05:03:26.621 --> 05:03:27.989
PERPETUATES THE INABILITY TO

05:03:28.056 --> 05:03:30.025
MAKE THINGS BETTER FOR MILLIONS

05:03:30.091 --> 05:03:30.659
OF WOMEN AND COUPLES THROUGHOUT

05:03:30.725 --> 05:03:31.893
THE WORLD.

05:03:31.960 --> 05:03:33.461
OUR ORGANIZATION IS NOT UNIQUE

05:03:33.528 --> 05:03:35.030
IN BEING LIMITED ON PURSING

05:03:35.096 --> 05:03:36.998
PROMISING RESEARCH INCREASE CARE.

05:03:37.065 --> 05:03:38.400
THERE ARE MANY OTHER ACADEMIC

05:03:38.466 --> 05:03:39.701
PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS

05:03:39.768 --> 05:03:41.002
ARE BEING STYMIED FROM DOING

05:03:41.069 --> 05:03:41.870
MEANINGFUL RESEARCH AND

05:03:41.937 --> 05:03:42.971
DEVELOPMENT THAT COULD

05:03:43.038 --> 05:03:44.205
TREMENDOUSLY BENEFIT WHEN AND

05:03:44.272 --> 05:03:45.774
EXPAND ACCESS TO POPULATIONS

05:03:45.840 --> 05:03:47.275
ACCOUNT CURRENTLY AFFORD THE

05:03:47.342 --> 05:03:48.276
EXPENSIVE TREATMENTS.

05:03:48.343 --> 05:03:50.111
ARE THOSE WHO DON'T WANT OR

05:03:50.178 --> 05:03:51.646
CAN'T USE THE HORMONE INJECTIONS.

05:03:51.713 --> 05:03:52.881
IF THEY CAN GET ACCESS TO ADD

05:03:52.948 --> 05:03:55.016
THIS THESE RESEARCHERS CAN DO.

05:03:55.083 --> 05:03:56.484
THIS IS A SOLVABLE PROBLEM OUR

05:03:56.551 --> 05:03:57.552
NEIGHBOR IN OREGON ALLOWS

05:03:57.619 --> 05:03:59.988
COMPENSATION FOR A DONATION FOR

RESEARCH PURPOSES AS DOES NEW

05:04:00.655 --> 05:04:01.389
YORK.

05:04:01.456 --> 05:04:02.857
WE CAN TAK THEM BOTH AS PROOF

05:04:02.924 --> 05:04:04.059
THERE IS A WAY TO DO THIS

05:04:04.125 --> 05:04:05.460
WITHOUT EVIDENCE OF EXPLOITATION

05:04:05.527 --> 05:04:07.162
OR ABUSE.

05:04:07.228 --> 05:04:08.830
I WOULD CAUTION TO THAT RESEARCH

05:04:08.897 --> 05:04:09.965
CAN LEAVE CALIFORNIA.

05:04:10.031 --> 05:04:11.166
GREAT COMPANIES AND RESEARCHERS

05:04:11.232 --> 05:04:12.300
STRUGGLING TO DO THIS TYPE OF

05:04:12.367 --> 05:04:13.201
WORK IN CALIFORNIA WILL GO

05:04:13.268 --> 05:04:14.536
ELSEWHERE.

05:04:14.603 --> 05:04:16.271
MY COMPANY FOR EXAMPLE IS DOING

05:04:16.338 --> 05:04:17.572
SOME OF OUR WORK IN LOCATIONS

05:04:17.639 --> 05:04:19.507
OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA AND MAY

05:04:19.574 --> 05:04:20.141
EVENTUALLY BE FORCED TO MOVE ALL

05:04:20.208 --> 05:04:21.576
TOGETHER.

05:04:21.643 --> 05:04:23.078
MASSACHUSETTS WHICH SIMILAR HAS

05:04:23.144 --> 05:04:23.979
MADE IT DIFFICULT TO DONATE EGGS

05:04:24.045 --> 05:04:25.080
FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES HAS

05:04:25.146 --> 05:04:26.481
ALREADY EXPERIENCED THIS.

05:04:26.548 --> 05:04:27.682
THE BOSTON AREA IS THE CLASSIC

05:04:27.749 --> 05:04:29.117
PLACE FOR LIFE SCIENCE RESEARCH

05:04:29.184 --> 05:04:30.885
IN THE US MANY RESEARCHERS AND

05:04:30.952 --> 05:04:31.686
COMPANIES HAVE ALREADY MOVED TO

05:04:31.753 --> 05:04:32.721
NEW YORK WHERE THE LAWS AROUND

05:04:32.787 --> 05:04:34.489
OBTAINING EGGS FOR RESEARCH AS

05:04:34.556 --> 05:04:35.590
MUCH FRIENDLIER.

05:04:35.657 --> 05:04:36.891
SO I COME HERE TO ASK PLEASE

05:04:36.958 --> 05:04:38.493
CONSIDER PASSING THIS LAW.

05:04:38.560 --> 05:04:39.694
THE BENEFITS IT COULD BRING TO

05:04:39.761 --> 05:04:41.463
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE SO HIGH

05:04:41.529 --> 05:04:43.665
AND THE RISK IS LOW.

IN MY JOINTS AND BODY.

05:06:39.280 --> 05:06:40.949
I DID NOT CONNECT THIS PAIN TO

05:07:14.549 --> 05:07:15.283
I WAS HEALTHY AND STRONG.

05:07:15.350 --> 05:07:18.419
I WAS FIREFIGHTER.

05:07:18.486 --> 05:07:20.088
I CAN NO LONGER WORKING MY

05:07:44.679 --> 05:07:46.848
MY ONGOING HEALTH PROBLEMS ARE

05:07:46.915 --> 05:07:48.216
LINKED TO THE SAME HORMONE

05:07:48.283 --> 05:07:50.185
DISRUPTORS THAT RESEARCH

05:07:50.251 --> 05:07:51.886
SUBJECTS WOULD YOU.

05:07:51.953 --> 05:07:54.656
USE.

05:07:54.722 --> 05:07:55.690
I'VE SPOKEN WITH HUNDREDS OF

05:07:55.757 --> 05:07:58.026
OTHER DONORS WHOSE LIVES WERE

05:07:58.092 --> 05:08:00.061
RUINED DUE TO OUR DONATIONS NO

05:08:00.128 --> 05:08:00.762
ONE SHOULD ENTER A LIFE OF

05:08:00.829 --> 05:08:03.731
SUFFERING FOR RESEARCH.

05:08:03.798 --> 05:08:05.600
INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON PROCURING

05:08:05.667 --> 05:08:07.402
EGGS AS RESEARCH MATERIALS WE

05:08:07.468 --> 05:08:10.138
NEED A LONG TERM STUDIES ON

05:08:10.205 --> 05:08:11.639
DONOR ILLNESS AND MORTALITY.

05:08:11.706 --> 05:08:12.674
THE SCIENCE HAS BEEN AROUND

05:08:12.740 --> 05:08:14.542
SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE AND

05:08:14.609 --> 05:08:16.578
WE HAVE STILL YET TO HAVE ONE

05:08:16.644 --> 05:08:18.313
LONG TERM STUDY ON A DONOR

05:08:18.379 --> 05:08:19.247
HEALTH.

05:08:19.314 --> 05:08:21.382
WOMEN DESERVE INFORMED CONSENT

05:08:21.449 --> 05:08:24.285
WITHOUT STUDIES WE DON'T HAVE IT.

05:08:24.352 --> 05:08:27.255
I ASK YOU TO OPPOSE AB NINE

TODAY I'M GOING TO DRAW UPON A

05:09:06.995 --> 05:09:09.130
COMPLETED SURVEYS WITH A HUNDRED

05:09:09.197 --> 05:09:09.697
FORTY ONE AND DONE IS LIKE

05:09:09.764 --> 05:09:11.766
COLLECTED IN TWO THOUSAND

NOTE MOST AND DONORS ARE FINE

05:09:19.007 --> 05:09:20.408
BUT THAT THERE'S ENOUGH CAUSE

05:09:20.475 --> 05:09:21.776
FOR CONCERN WAS THAT SOME OF THE

05:09:21.843 --> 05:09:23.811
OTHER ONES WHO NOT.

05:09:23.878 --> 05:09:25.046
THAT MAKE ME FEEL LIKE I NEED TO

INFORMATION THAT COULD BE

05:09:28.650 --> 05:09:29.183
HELPFUL.

05:09:29.250 --> 05:09:30.518
THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS ARE

05:09:30.585 --> 05:09:31.386
IN MY STUDY WERE IN THE EARLY TO

05:09:31.452 --> 05:09:32.754
MID TWENTIES AT THE TIME OF THE

FIRST CYCLE A DONATION CYCLE.

05:09:34.956 --> 05:09:36.057
OVER HALF REPORTED IN INCOMES BE

05:09:36.124 --> 05:09:37.592
LOWER SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE FEDERAL

MORE THAN SIX TAUGHT CYCLES.

05:09:46.067 --> 05:09:47.702
DUE IN PART TO POTENTIAL UNKNOWN

DONOR CYCLES AND NO OVERSIGHT

05:10:12.694 --> 05:10:16.965
WHICH MEANS THERE IS ESSENTIALLY

05:10:17.031 --> 05:10:18.199
NO INFORMED CONSENT.

05:10:18.266 --> 05:10:18.866

COMPLICATIONS MORE FREQUENTLY

05:10:20.468 --> 05:10:21.736
THAN THE 1% CITED IN MUCH OF THE

05:10:38.419 --> 05:10:40.088
OR VERY INTO PORTION REQUIRING

05:10:40.154 --> 05:10:41.756
REMOVAL OF THE OVARY.

05:10:41.823 --> 05:10:42.991
SEVERAL HAD ENDOMETRIOSIS --

05:10:49.731 --> 05:10:53.101
THIS IS CONNECTED TO THE REC

05:10:53.167 --> 05:10:54.168
DONATIONS ARE NOT.

05:10:54.235 --> 05:10:55.169
ACCORDING TO THE BILL TEXT

OVER TIME SO WE CAN HAVE A

05:11:47.422 --> 05:11:48.756
BETTER IDEA OF WHAT THE LONG

MINIMAL IMPACT TO OUR MEMBERSHIP

05:35:05.785 --> 05:35:06.886
UNFORTUNATELY THOSE WHAT THIS

IT WOULD TIE THEM TO DE MHC

05:35:25.004 --> 05:35:26.372

05:35:26.439 --> 05:35:28.308
QUESTION OF DUE PROCESS WITH

05:35:28.374 --> 05:35:29.843

05:43:51.077 --> 05:43:52.578

THAT THE MANUFACTURERS WOULD PAY

05:44:02.488 --> 05:44:04.023

05:44:04.090 --> 05:44:05.358

WE DON'T HAVE WE SIMPLY DON'T

05:44:16.836 --> 05:44:17.536

05:44:17.603 --> 05:44:21.040
CAPABILITY. TO TAKE ON THE

05:44:21.107 --> 05:44:22.174

TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BUT WE

05:52:30.429 --> 05:52:31.530
DON'T THINK THIS BILL IS THE

05:52:31.597 --> 05:52:32.865
RIGHT APPROACH WE'RE

05:52:32.931 --> 05:52:34.633

05:52:42.207 --> 05:52:43.041
THEY'RE ALREADY HAVING A

05:52:43.108 --> 05:52:45.744
DIFFICULT TIME MAINTAINING STOCK

05:52:45.811 --> 05:52:47.446

GOAL TO PREVENT.

05:52:52.150 --> 05:52:53.619
THIS COSTS FROM BEING PASSED ON

TO THE PURCHASER WITH THIS

05:52:54.786 --> 05:52:56.188
PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION

05:52:56.255 --> 05:52:57.990
AND PURCHASED SO THERE IS THE

05:52:58.056 --> 05:52:59.157
PHARMACIST.

05:52:59.224 --> 05:53:00.826

DISTRIBUTORS AND THE

05:53:05.163 --> 05:53:07.332
MANUFACTURERS WE DO NOT BELIEVE

05:53:07.399 --> 05:53:09.134
THAT THERE IS A WAY.

05:53:09.201 --> 05:53:11.904
TO ENFORCE THE THE PROVISION OF

THE BILL AGAIN WHICH ATTEMPTS TO

05:53:13.505 --> 05:53:15.274
PROHIBIT THE PASSING DOWN OF

WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THIS

05:53:21.513 --> 05:53:22.781
MEDICATION WILL BECOME

05:53:22.848 --> 05:53:26.518
UNAFFORDABLE FOR PHARMACISTS TO

BE ABLE TO START.

05:53:27.286 --> 05:53:27.886
MAKING IT DIFFICULT AND IN SOME

05:53:27.953 --> 05:53:29.221
CASES IMPOSSIBLE FOR PATIENTS TO

BE ABLE TO A CAR THE MEDICATIONS

05:53:31.189 --> 05:53:32.558
WE KNOW THERE'S A PROBLEM OUT

05:53:32.624 --> 05:53:34.259

AND IT'S BECOMING INCREASINGLY

05:53:41.133 --> 05:53:42.634
DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO AND TO GET

PEOPLE SIGNED A PETITION.

06:03:20.678 --> 06:03:21.579
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE CALL THE

06:03:21.646 --> 06:03:23.448

WORKING WITH COUNTIES INTERESTED

06:03:33.158 --> 06:03:35.360
ON INFO ON IMPLEMENTING THIS --

06:03:35.426 --> 06:03:36.995
IN ISSUING HOME COOKING PERMITS

06:03:37.061 --> 06:03:38.263
HOWEVER IT'S KIND OF BEEN REALLY

06:03:38.329 --> 06:03:39.397
SLOW TO IMPLEMENT THE LAW

06:03:39.464 --> 06:03:40.331
BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN CONFUSION

06:03:40.398 --> 06:03:41.699
AROUND BOTH JURISDICTIONAL

06:03:41.766 --> 06:03:42.634
ISSUES.

06:03:42.700 --> 06:03:44.402
AND SOME PUBLIC HEALTH

06:03:44.469 --> 06:03:45.670
REQUIREMENTS.

06:03:45.737 --> 06:03:46.638
SO IT THIS BILL SO THIS IS

06:03:46.704 --> 06:03:47.805
SIGNIFICANTLY SLOW THE

06:03:47.872 --> 06:03:49.474
IMPLEMENTATION IN MANY COUNTIES

06:03:49.541 --> 06:03:51.176
EFFECTIVELY BLOCKING THIS THIS

06:03:51.242 --> 06:03:52.477
NEW OPPORTUNITY FOR THOUSANDS OF

06:03:52.544 --> 06:03:53.344

HE SUPPORTERS CONTINUE TO BE

06:03:59.350 --> 06:04:00.485
EXCITED TO EMBRACE THE

06:04:00.552 --> 06:04:01.352
OPPORTUNITY AND WE BELIEVE THAT

06:04:01.419 --> 06:04:03.688
AB THREE SEVEN SEVEN ONE BLOCK

06:04:03.755 --> 06:04:05.490
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SIXTY SIX

06:04:05.557 --> 06:04:07.125
BECAUSE IT CREATES MORE CLARITY.

06:04:07.192 --> 06:04:08.927
AROUND PUBLIC HEALTH AND HOW IT

06:04:08.993 --> 06:04:09.561
COUNTIES AND OF COURSE THE FOUR

06:04:09.627 --> 06:04:11.329

06:04:11.396 --> 06:04:12.764

COLLABORATION BETWEEN PUBLIC

06:04:14.732 --> 06:04:15.767
HEALTH OFFICIALS AND HOME

06:04:15.833 --> 06:04:18.536
COOKING ADVOCATES THREE SEVEN

06:04:18.603 --> 06:04:19.137

RISK OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.

06:04:26.010 --> 06:04:27.278

06:04:27.345 --> 06:04:28.746
ALLOWING HOME COOKS WHICH ARE

06:04:28.813 --> 06:04:30.248

MAKES IT CLEAR TO CHELATION OF

06:04:53.371 --> 06:04:54.272
THE FACT THAT HOME KITCHEN

THE UNDERLYING BILL AND WE

06:05:58.569 --> 06:05:59.837
THOUGHT THAT THE DIRECTION THE

06:05:59.904 --> 06:06:01.139
BILL WAS TO ALLOW JURISDICTIONS

06:06:01.205 --> 06:06:02.540

APPROPRIATE THING FOR THIS

06:06:22.393 --> 06:06:23.194
DECISION TO BE MADE FOR THAT

06:06:23.261 --> 06:06:23.828

BROKEN BONE WITH SOME METAL AND

06:11:13.250 --> 06:11:14.885
PLANTED IT'S ALMOST CERTAIN THE

06:11:14.952 --> 06:11:16.754
FEROCITY WOULD HAVE BEEN USED

06:11:16.821 --> 06:11:18.456
DURING THAT PROCEDURE -- WE

REPAIRED BONE WITH A ROD AND

06:11:35.406 --> 06:11:36.507
SOME SCREWS IN PLACE THE

06:11:36.574 --> 06:11:37.975
FLUOROSCOPY IS CRITICAL DURING

06:11:38.042 --> 06:11:40.011
THE SURGERY TO DO THIS FIRST TO

06:11:40.077 --> 06:11:41.045
MAKE SURE THE BONES ARE ALIGNED

06:11:41.112 --> 06:11:42.647
PROPERLY BEFORE THE PLACE IN THE

06:11:42.713 --> 06:11:43.280
HARDWARE.

06:11:43.347 --> 06:11:45.082

06:11:46.283 --> 06:11:48.653
PROPERLY -- SO THAT THE BONES

06:11:48.719 --> 06:11:49.887
WITH YOUR WHOLE CORRECTLY.

06:11:49.954 --> 06:11:51.722
ON THE CORRECT POSITION AND NONE

06:11:51.789 --> 06:11:52.256

06:11:58.763 --> 06:11:59.530
SURGERIES.

06:11:59.597 --> 06:12:01.132
SO HERE'S THE PROBLEM.

06:12:01.198 --> 06:12:02.266
EVERYONE AGREES IT FOR US TO BE

06:12:02.333 --> 06:12:04.402

SOCIETY.

06:15:08.719 --> 06:15:09.587
WE'RE GOING TO WE WERE OPPOSED

06:15:09.653 --> 06:15:12.089
WE OF UNDERSTAND THE THE

06:15:12.156 --> 06:15:13.691
COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE COMPLEX IS

06:15:13.757 --> 06:15:15.392
THE PROCESS WOULD WELCOME -- ANY

06:15:15.459 --> 06:15:17.161
REFORM THAT EFFORT THE TEST IS

06:15:17.228 --> 06:15:19.330
ADMINISTERED BY AN OUTSIDE

06:15:19.396 --> 06:15:20.698
NATIONALIZATION.

06:15:20.764 --> 06:15:21.332
WAS THE WEARABLE THE TIME FRAME

06:15:21.398 --> 06:15:21.899
ISSUES BUT CERTAINLY THAT'S

06:15:21.966 --> 06:15:23.067
SOMETHING WE WOULD SUPPORT --

06:15:23.133 --> 06:15:25.102
REVISIONS ON THE TEST ITSELF IS

06:15:25.169 --> 06:15:25.903
SOMETHING THE MEASURE THE

06:15:25.970 --> 06:15:27.371
COMPETENCY THE POSITION THEIR

06:15:27.438 --> 06:15:28.839
KNOWLEDGE OF RADIATION SAFETY

06:15:28.906 --> 06:15:31.075
AND RADIATION DOSE -- AS THE

06:15:31.141 --> 06:15:32.977
ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON TESTIFIED FOR

06:15:33.043 --> 06:15:34.278
OSCAR B. AS A REAL TIME IMAGE

06:15:34.345 --> 06:15:35.746
STANDING ON THAT PEDAL TOO LONG

06:15:35.813 --> 06:15:37.381
EXPOSE THE PATIENT NECESSARILY

06:15:37.448 --> 06:15:38.349
TO EXCESS RADIATION.

06:15:38.415 --> 06:15:39.850
AS WELL AS POSITION THEMSELVES

06:15:39.917 --> 06:15:40.818
SO HAVING THAT KNOWLEDGE WE

06:15:40.885 --> 06:15:42.286
THINK IS ESSENTIAL TO

06:15:42.353 --> 06:15:45.322
APPROPRIATE -- USE OF THE

06:15:45.389 --> 06:15:45.823
EQUIPMENT FOR IN PATIENT

06:15:45.890 --> 06:15:46.724
PROTECTION.

06:15:46.790 --> 06:15:47.258
THE PHILOSOPHY PERMIT WAS

06:15:47.324 --> 06:15:48.692
CREATED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE

06:15:48.759 --> 06:15:49.927
BECAUSE THE PERCEPTION THAT

06:15:49.994 --> 06:15:51.562
TRAINING EDUCATION WAS ON EVEN

06:15:51.629 --> 06:15:53.731
IN THE STATE SO MODEL SYLLABUS

06:15:53.797 --> 06:15:54.465
WAS DEVELOPING A TEST WAS

06:15:54.531 --> 06:15:55.432
CREATED.

06:15:55.499 --> 06:15:57.434
BUT HAS BEEN MODIFIED THE PASS

06:15:57.501 --> 06:16:00.137
RATE IS 83% THE LAST TWO YEARS

06:16:00.204 --> 06:16:00.905
SO I WAS OF THE TEST ITSELF IS

06:16:00.971 --> 06:16:02.806
NOT AN IMPEDIMENT GETTING TO THE

06:16:02.873 --> 06:16:04.341
TEST SEEMS TO BE THE PROBLEM.

06:16:04.408 --> 06:16:05.442
SO WOULD WELCOME THAT EFFORT TO

06:16:05.509 --> 06:16:06.877
REFORM IT THINK THE PERMIT

06:16:06.944 --> 06:16:10.080
PROCESS IS LEGITIMATE REGIONAL

06:16:10.147 --> 06:16:11.615
FOR PATIENT PROTECTION.

06:16:11.682 --> 06:16:12.483
THE NEW JAYCO REQUIREMENTS ARE

06:16:12.549 --> 06:16:14.285
HEADING TOWARDS MORE

06:16:14.351 --> 06:16:16.086
DOCUMENTATION NOT LESS SO I

06:16:16.153 --> 06:16:16.954
THINK CALIFORNIA MAY HAVE BEEN

06:16:17.021 --> 06:16:18.255
OUT IN FRONT OF THIS ISSUE BUT

06:16:18.322 --> 06:16:18.889
PROBABLY OTHER STATES GOING TO

06:16:18.956 --> 06:16:19.857
CATCH UP.

06:16:19.924 --> 06:16:21.125
IN TERMS OF THE REQUIREMENTS ARE

06:16:21.191 --> 06:16:22.559
TO BE PLACED OPPOSITION SO

06:16:22.626 --> 06:16:24.762
REGRETFULLY REPOSE THE CURRENT

06:16:24.828 --> 06:16:26.797
VERSION THANK YOU.

06:16:26.864 --> 06:16:27.398
Q. QUESTIONS CONCERN FROM THE

06:16:27.464 --> 06:16:30.000
COMMITTEE [inaudible]

06:16:30.067 --> 06:16:32.603
MR MAKES.

06:16:32.670 --> 06:16:34.071
YOU KNOW THESE THINGS ARE --

06:16:34.138 --> 06:16:37.808
SPEED OF DIFFICULT THE BOMB.

06:16:37.875 --> 06:16:38.776
AND IN I ALWAYS WONDER IT'S

06:16:38.842 --> 06:16:40.044
ALWAYS THE QUESTION WHY THE

06:16:40.110 --> 06:16:42.012
RADIOLOGICAL SOCIETY WOULD WOULD

06:16:42.079 --> 06:16:43.447
BE OPPOSE IS IT.

06:16:43.514 --> 06:16:46.650
IS IT TRULY BECAUSE OF THIS

06:16:46.717 --> 06:16:48.619
PERMIT PROCESS OR IS THERE SOME

06:16:48.686 --> 06:16:50.554
OTHER ECONOMIC INTEREST ON THAT

06:16:50.621 --> 06:16:52.056
IS GUIDING OF THE IT GOT IN THE

06:16:52.122 --> 06:16:53.757
OPPOSITION -- SO IT IS OR

06:16:53.824 --> 06:16:56.260
SOMEONE A WORKAROUND IS TO GET

06:16:56.327 --> 06:16:57.661
YOU TO SUPPORT.

06:16:57.728 --> 06:16:58.996
WELL I I DON'T THINK WE WOULD

06:16:59.063 --> 06:17:00.397
THERE'S NO ECONOMIC AUTOMATION A

06:17:00.464 --> 06:17:01.598
RADIOLOGIST OF THE PRIMARY

06:17:01.665 --> 06:17:03.100
PROVIDERS IMAGE SERVICES YOU

06:17:03.167 --> 06:17:04.835
KNOW AND PROBABLY DO A FAIR

06:17:04.902 --> 06:17:06.837
AMOUNT OF FLUOROSCOPY BUT IN THE

06:17:06.904 --> 06:17:08.405
SURGERY SUITE IS THE SURGEON

06:17:08.472 --> 06:17:08.672
DOING IT.

06:17:08.739 --> 06:17:10.207
AND THE PODIATRY -- SURGICAL

06:17:10.274 --> 06:17:12.609
OFFICE IT'S A PODIATRIST WE

06:17:12.676 --> 06:17:14.111
ALL WE'RE SAYING IS THAT

06:17:14.178 --> 06:17:15.679
PHYSICIAN AND THE PATIENT SHOULD

06:17:15.746 --> 06:17:16.747
HAVE.

06:17:16.814 --> 06:17:18.449
A PRACTITIONER KNOWLEDGEABLE OF

06:17:18.515 --> 06:17:20.017
RADIATION DOSE AND SAFETY IT'S

06:17:20.084 --> 06:17:22.019
NOT SOMETHING IT'S INDICATIVE OF

06:17:22.086 --> 06:17:23.754
THOSE SPECIALTIES IT IS FOR

06:17:23.821 --> 06:17:24.888
RADIOLOGY.

06:17:24.955 --> 06:17:27.725
BUT THE TEST AND 83% PASS IS NOT

06:17:27.791 --> 06:17:28.659
AN IMPEDIMENT.

06:17:28.726 --> 06:17:30.294
AND SEEMS TO BE REASONABLE IN

06:17:30.361 --> 06:17:31.795
TERMS OF EDUCATION SO.

06:17:31.862 --> 06:17:33.564
IT'S REALLY A MATTER OF GETTING

06:17:33.630 --> 06:17:35.032
TO A POINT WHERE THE PHYSICIAN

06:17:35.099 --> 06:17:36.133
CAN ACCOMPLISH THE PERMANENT

06:17:36.200 --> 06:17:37.768
TIMELY BASIS AND WE WOULD

06:17:37.835 --> 06:17:39.069
SUPPORT THAT -- THAT'S MORE THE

06:17:39.136 --> 06:17:40.371
BUREAUCRACY AND NOT SOMETHING WE

06:17:40.437 --> 06:17:42.740
CONTROL -- IMAGE WISE IT WAS

06:17:42.806 --> 06:17:43.507
MENTIONED RADIOLOGIST THE

06:17:43.574 --> 06:17:45.009
FOREFRONT OF REDUCING THE DOSE

06:17:45.075 --> 06:17:46.043
MAKING THE DOES THE MINIMUM

06:17:46.110 --> 06:17:47.778
NECESSARY TO ACCOMPLISH THE

06:17:47.845 --> 06:17:48.712
DIAGNOSTIC PURPOSE.

06:17:48.779 --> 06:17:50.180
SO WE'RE NOT THERE'S NOTHING

06:17:50.247 --> 06:17:51.281
HERE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO RUN

06:17:51.348 --> 06:17:54.284
OTHER PHYSICIANS FROM PRACTICING

06:17:54.351 --> 06:17:56.086
AT ALL.

06:17:56.153 --> 06:17:57.488
THE ANSWERS A QUESTION WOULD

06:17:57.554 --> 06:17:58.689
IMAGES TO THE I THINK THE

06:17:58.756 --> 06:17:59.890
RADIOLOGIST SO OBVIOUSLY --

06:17:59.957 --> 06:18:00.758
SPECIALISTS BY HERE AND HAVE THE

06:18:00.824 --> 06:18:03.260
THE KNOWLEDGE IN ANY INSIGHT --

06:18:03.327 --> 06:18:05.229
AND AND SO IT'S TO ME IT'S IT'S

06:18:05.295 --> 06:18:06.497
IT'S A CONCERN THAT YOU GUYS ARE

06:18:06.563 --> 06:18:07.898
ARE OPPOSED TO THIS AND I'M JUST

06:18:07.965 --> 06:18:09.400
WONDERING.

06:18:09.466 --> 06:18:10.567
IF THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE TO BE

06:18:10.634 --> 06:18:14.004
ABLE TO GET -- YOU KNOW TO WHERE

06:18:14.071 --> 06:18:14.605
YOU GUYS CAN GET TO A SUPPORT

06:18:14.671 --> 06:18:16.840
POSITION.

06:18:16.907 --> 06:18:17.641
I DON'T KNOW IS THAT THE AUTHOR

06:18:17.708 --> 06:18:18.942
OF YOU GUYS HAVING CONVERSATIONS

06:18:19.009 --> 06:18:20.444
WE CONTINUE TO KEEP WORKING WITH

06:18:20.511 --> 06:18:21.812
THEM TO WELL -- I'M HAPPY TO

06:18:21.879 --> 06:18:22.446
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM AND

06:18:22.513 --> 06:18:23.614
THEY LET LET ME FIRST START OFF

06:18:23.680 --> 06:18:24.815
BY SAYING THAT I WOULD BE WITH

06:18:24.882 --> 06:18:26.350
ANY STANDARDS TRAINING SAFETY.

06:18:26.417 --> 06:18:29.086
A MEASURE THAT AT THAT -- THAT

06:18:29.153 --> 06:18:30.988
THEY WOULD PUT ON THE TABLE --

06:18:31.055 --> 06:18:32.689
WHEN I AGREED TO TAKE THE BILL I

06:18:32.756 --> 06:18:33.457
KIND OF I CAN LOOK AT THIS AND

06:18:33.524 --> 06:18:34.358
THOUGHT IT WAS AND -- GOOD

06:18:34.425 --> 06:18:36.894
EFFICIENCY BILL SO IF YOU HAVE

06:18:36.960 --> 06:18:38.162
TESTING THAT IT THAT THAT IS

06:18:38.228 --> 06:18:39.496
STATE MANDATED IN NOW THE

06:18:39.563 --> 06:18:41.565
HOSPITALS HAVE TO DO THIS SORT

06:18:41.632 --> 06:18:41.899
OF TRAINING.

06:18:41.965 --> 06:18:44.168
EVERY YEAR -- WE CAN EASILY WORK

06:18:44.234 --> 06:18:45.035
ON CHANGING THE TRAINING AT THE

06:18:45.102 --> 06:18:46.770
HOSPITAL IF THERE'S SOMETHING

06:18:46.837 --> 06:18:48.705
THAT THAT IS SEEN IS DEFICIENT --

06:18:48.772 --> 06:18:50.107
FROM THE RADIOLOGIST PERSPECTIVE

06:18:50.174 --> 06:18:51.909
BUT WHY IF THE TRAINING OF THE

06:18:51.975 --> 06:18:53.310
HOSPITAL AND THE DOCTOR HAS TO

06:18:53.377 --> 06:18:54.178
THE TRAINING AT THE HOSPITAL

06:18:54.244 --> 06:18:54.778
THEY WERE GONNA SEND OF THE

06:18:54.845 --> 06:18:56.847
STATE -- THE CERTIFICATION

06:18:56.914 --> 06:18:58.449
PROCESS WHEN WE COULD JUST DO AT

06:18:58.515 --> 06:18:59.917
THE HOSPITAL WHEN THEY'RE DOING

06:18:59.983 --> 06:19:00.984
THEIR I MEAN I HAVEN'T.

MY MEMBERS ARE VERY ENGAGED IN

06:29:29.145 --> 06:29:30.580
IN IMPLEMENTING THESE.

06:29:30.647 --> 06:29:32.248
INVOLVES CHANGING ON HOW THEY

COLLECT DATA FROM PROVIDERS H.

06:29:34.117 --> 06:29:35.752
EDUCATING PROVIDERS THAT THEY

AND THEY'RE VERY COMMITTED TO

06:29:39.656 --> 06:29:42.425
MAKING THAT WORK AND SO -- TO

06:29:42.492 --> 06:29:43.593
REQUIRE THAT A STAKEHOLDER

06:29:43.660 --> 06:29:46.329
PROCESS BE DEVELOPED TO CREATE A

06:29:46.396 --> 06:29:47.931
NEW QALITY PROGRAM IS A PROBLEM

06:29:47.997 --> 06:29:49.199
FOR US BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW HOW

06:29:49.265 --> 06:29:50.767
THAT WILL LINE WITH THE WORK

06:29:50.834 --> 06:29:55.839
THAT WE'RE DOING TO IMPLEMENT

06:29:55.905 --> 06:29:58.141
THE NEW -- PROCESS OUTLINES THAT

06:29:58.208 --> 06:29:58.808
I JUST THAT COVERED -- AND WE'RE

06:29:58.875 --> 06:29:59.476
ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT SOME OF THE

06:29:59.542 --> 06:30:00.643
REQUIREMENTS -- FOR HEALTH PLANS

06:30:00.710 --> 06:30:02.212

06:30:02.278 --> 06:30:04.848
DATA -- SOME OF THE INFORMATION --

06:30:04.914 --> 06:30:06.149
IN THE DEMOGRAPHICS THAT THEY

06:30:06.216 --> 06:30:07.617
WANT HEALTH POINT MINT MEDI CAL

06:30:07.684 --> 06:30:09.219
MANAGED CARE PLANS DO NOT HAVE

06:30:09.285 --> 06:30:10.487
WE DO NOT GET IT.

06:30:10.553 --> 06:30:11.921
FROM THE FILE OF OUR ENROLLEES

06:30:11.988 --> 06:30:13.356
THAT JUST THEIR PROCESS TO THE

06:30:13.423 --> 06:30:14.491
COUNTIES BECAUSE THAT

06:30:14.557 --> 06:30:16.025
INFORMATION IS A FAST.

06:30:16.092 --> 06:30:18.394
AND SO TO SET AN EXPECTATION OF

06:30:18.461 --> 06:30:20.430
THAT WE WOULD -- PROVIDE CERTAIN

06:30:20.497 --> 06:30:22.165
INFORMATION ON OUR ROLE IS THAT

06:30:22.232 --> 06:30:23.767

THIS IN AN AWKWARD POSITION WHEN

06:30:25.168 --> 06:30:26.369
WE'RE LOOKING AT THE QUALITY OF

06:30:26.436 --> 06:30:28.171
THOSE REPORTS ONCE THEY BEGIN

06:30:28.238 --> 06:30:29.539
BEING PUBLISHED.

06:30:29.606 --> 06:30:32.642
AND SO -- WE DO A LIKE THE

06:30:32.709 --> 06:30:34.878
APPROACH TO INCLUDE A FINANCIAL

06:30:34.944 --> 06:30:36.613
INCENTIVE PROGRAM FOR PLANTS

06:30:36.679 --> 06:30:38.248
THAT EXCEED THEIR QUALITY LEVELS

06:30:38.314 --> 06:30:39.649
THAT'S A DIFFERENT APPROACH THAN

06:30:39.716 --> 06:30:40.617
WE'VE SEEN BEFORE WE DON'T

06:30:40.683 --> 06:30:42.452

06:30:44.220 --> 06:30:45.789
AND PAY FOR PERFORMANCE IS

06:30:45.855 --> 06:30:46.990
SOMETHING THAT WE DO DO WITH OUR

06:30:47.056 --> 06:30:48.091
