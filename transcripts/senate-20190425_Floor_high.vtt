CHARITABLE FOUNDATIONS AND THE

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:09.755
VERY DRAMATICALLY IN THE

00:23:09.821 --> 00:23:11.256
METHODOLOGY THE USED TO

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.695
MORE CONCERNING IS THE FACT THAT

UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW OUR CURRENT

00:23:18.563 --> 00:23:20.499

ACCURATELY ESTIMATES THE RISK

00:23:32.811 --> 00:23:35.447
WHILE MINIMIZING BIAS.

REGARDING THE USE OF RISK

ASSESSMENT TOOLS. ONE ANY COUNTY

00:23:45.824 --> 00:23:47.793
THAT USES A TOOL MUST VALIDATE

00:23:47.859 --> 00:23:50.028
THE TO ON A REGULAR BASIS THAT

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:56.067
TRANSPARENT.

00:23:56.134 --> 00:23:57.402
THAT MEANS IT COUNTIES NEED TO

00:23:57.469 --> 00:23:59.137
TELL THE PUBLIC EXACTLY HOW THE

00:23:59.204 --> 00:24:03.508
RISK CORES ARE BEING CALCULATED.

00:24:03.575 --> 00:24:04.576

THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'D STOOD ON

00:25:04.936 --> 00:25:07.405
THE FLOOR AS WE DEBATED THE BAIL

00:25:07.472 --> 00:25:09.241
BILL LAST YEAR -- WHEN SOME

00:25:09.307 --> 00:25:10.809
FOLKS HAD SOME CONCERNS ABOUT

00:25:10.876 --> 00:25:12.143
THE FINAL VERSION OF THE BILL

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:13.645
AND WHETHER OR NOT?

00:25:13.712 --> 00:25:15.247
IT WAS TIMELY WEATHER NOT IT WAS

00:25:15.313 --> 00:25:16.348
COOKED YET AND SAID THAT I WOULD

00:25:16.414 --> 00:25:17.682
STAND WITH MISTER HERTZBERG

00:25:17.749 --> 00:25:18.516
AGAIN.

00:25:18.583 --> 00:25:21.353
THIS YEAR TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

00:25:21.419 --> 00:25:22.420
GET IT RIGHT.

00:25:22.487 --> 00:25:24.689
AND I BELIEVE SB THIRTY SIX IS

00:25:24.756 --> 00:25:26.391
THE APPROPRIATE NEXT STEP IN

00:25:26.458 --> 00:25:27.425
GUARANTEEING THAT WE GET IT

00:25:27.492 --> 00:25:29.728
RIGHT.

00:25:29.794 --> 00:25:32.163
WE CAN DEBATE THE INHERENT BIAS

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:34.566
OF RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS FRANKLY

00:25:34.633 --> 00:25:36.234
UNTIL THE COWS COME HOME.

00:25:36.301 --> 00:25:37.235
BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS

00:25:37.302 --> 00:25:39.638
THAT ANY PREDICTIVE TOOL WE USE

00:25:39.704 --> 00:25:41.172
IN ANY PART OF OUR LIVES IS IN

00:25:41.239 --> 00:25:44.843
SOME WAY GOING TO USE THE PASS.

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:46.811
TO SHED LIGHT ON THE FUTURE.

00:25:46.878 --> 00:25:47.712
THIS IS TRUE WHEN JUDGES LOOK AT

00:25:47.779 --> 00:25:48.647
RAPSHEETS TO MAKE A BILL

00:25:48.713 --> 00:25:50.181
DETERMINATION ARE WHEN

00:25:50.248 --> 00:25:51.650
ECONOMISTS LOOK AT BOOM AND BUST

00:25:51.716 --> 00:25:53.285
CYCLES TO TRY AND PREDICT THE

00:25:53.351 --> 00:25:54.619
NEXT RECESSION.

00:25:54.686 --> 00:25:56.788
WE HAVE A CHOICE WE CAN GIVE

00:25:56.855 --> 00:25:58.323
INTERFERE CENSORSHIP SYSTEM

00:25:58.390 --> 00:25:59.958
ACTORS OF A VALUABLE TOOL THAT

00:26:00.025 --> 00:26:02.260
HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PROTECT

00:26:02.327 --> 00:26:03.495
INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY.

00:26:03.561 --> 00:26:06.197
AND PUBLIC SAFETY OR WE CAN DO

00:26:06.264 --> 00:26:07.532
THE HARD WORK OF BUILDING IN

00:26:07.599 --> 00:26:09.601
SAFEGUARS TO MAKE SURE THIS

00:26:09.668 --> 00:26:13.872
TOOL IS USE THE RIGHT WAY.

00:26:13.939 --> 00:26:15.006
THERE'S THIS HOVERING FEAR OUT

00:26:15.073 --> 00:26:17.275
THERE ABOUT THE USE OF MACHINES

00:26:17.342 --> 00:26:18.376
AND YOU'LL READ IT FROM BOTH

00:26:18.443 --> 00:26:19.611
CRITICS.

00:26:19.678 --> 00:26:21.279
AND SUPPORTERS ON BOTH SIDES

00:26:21.346 --> 00:26:22.547
THAT IF WE ALLOW COURTS AND

00:26:22.614 --> 00:26:24.883
COUNTIES TO USE THESE TOOLS WILL

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:27.152
BE LEADING MACHINES MAKE

00:26:27.218 --> 00:26:29.421
DECISIONS ABOUT OUR LIBERTY.

00:26:29.487 --> 00:26:30.889
THE CRITICS ARE WRONG.

00:26:30.956 --> 00:26:33.658
THESE MACHINES DO NOT MAKE

01:25:16.544 --> 01:25:17.412
SENATOR JACKSON.

01:25:17.479 --> 01:25:18.980
GOOD MORNING MADAM CENTER THANK

01:25:19.047 --> 01:25:22.484
YOU VERY MUCH MISTER PRESIDENT

01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:24.018
COLLEAGUES I AM.

01:25:24.085 --> 01:25:25.386
I LOOK BACK AT MY EARLY CAREER

01:25:25.453 --> 01:25:26.621
WHICH FOR SOME WAS A LONG LONG

01:25:26.688 --> 01:25:28.490
TIME AGO AND THEY PROBABLY

01:25:28.556 --> 01:25:31.125
WEREN'T EVEN ALIVE YET -- AS A

01:25:31.192 --> 01:25:32.827
DEPUTY DA.

01:25:32.894 --> 01:25:34.462
BACK TRUST.

01:25:34.529 --> 01:25:35.930
A FEW DECADES AGO.

01:25:35.997 --> 01:25:38.933
A MAN COULD NOT RAPE HIS WIFE.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.603
THE LAW SPECIFICALLY SAID RAPE

01:25:41.669 --> 01:25:43.304
IS A CRIME COMMITTED AGAINST

01:25:43.371 --> 01:25:47.509
SOMEONE OTHER THAN YOUR WIFE.

01:25:47.575 --> 01:25:50.411
SO IT HASN'T BEEN THAT LONG.

01:25:50.478 --> 01:25:52.814
SINCE WE HAVE RECOGNIZED HOW

01:25:52.881 --> 01:25:56.184
SIGNIFICANT AND SERIOUS A CRIME

01:25:56.251 --> 01:25:57.018
RAPE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT.

01:25:57.085 --> 01:26:01.356
OUR IT IS THESE ARE CRIMES THAT

01:26:01.422 --> 01:26:04.225
ARE DESIGNED TO HUMILIATE. TO

01:26:04.292 --> 01:26:06.861
DEGRADE TWO SUBORDINATE TO

01:26:06.928 --> 01:26:09.564
SUBJUGATE WOMEN.

01:26:09.631 --> 01:26:12.400
AND SO I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS

01:26:12.467 --> 01:26:15.737
RESOLUTION BUT ALSO TO REMIND.

01:26:15.803 --> 01:26:17.872
OUR COLLEAGUES THAT.

01:26:17.939 --> 01:26:21.342
THE ATTITUDES ABOUT RAPE.

01:26:21.409 --> 01:26:23.811
HAVE CHANGED BUT NOT QUITE AS

01:26:23.878 --> 01:26:26.447
QUICKLY AS WE WOULD HOPE.

01:26:26.514 --> 01:26:29.517
AND SO WE HAVE TO ALSO CONSIDER

01:26:29.584 --> 01:26:31.519
THE FACT THAT.

01:26:31.586 --> 01:26:33.555
RAPE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT ARE

01:26:33.621 --> 01:26:35.290
CRIMES.

01:26:35.356 --> 01:26:38.893
THAT A REPORTED ONLY ABOUT 23%

01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:41.162
OF THE TIME.

01:26:41.229 --> 01:26:44.866
WHY BECAUSE WOMEN ARE AFRAID OF

01:26:44.933 --> 01:26:47.769
BEING ACCUSED AGAIN THE FAULT

01:26:47.835 --> 01:26:49.170
LAY WITH THE WOMAN WHO WAS

01:26:49.237 --> 01:26:51.306
WEARING BLUE JEANS?

01:26:51.372 --> 01:26:53.141
WE NOW HAVE MOVEMENT MOVEMENTS

01:26:53.207 --> 01:26:54.876
ARE OF HEAD MOVEMENTS LIKE TAKE

01:26:54.943 --> 01:26:56.411
BACK THE NIGHT.

01:26:56.477 --> 01:26:58.580
BECAUSE WOMEN ARE AFRAID OFTEN

01:26:58.646 --> 01:27:00.248
TO GO OUT IN THE EVENING AND IF

01:27:00.315 --> 01:27:01.749
THEY ARE IF THEY DO AND THEY

01:27:01.816 --> 01:27:02.750
WERE ASSAULTED.

01:27:02.817 --> 01:27:05.353
IT IS THEIR FAULT.

01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:06.921
AND SO WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE IT

01:27:06.988 --> 01:27:10.325
AS MUCH AS WE SYMBOLICALLY WEAR

01:27:10.391 --> 01:27:12.226
JEANS ONE DAY A YEAR.

01:27:12.293 --> 01:27:14.996
THIS IS A CULTURAL PROBLEM.

01:27:15.063 --> 01:27:16.898
AND WE MUST SHIFT THAT CULTURE

01:27:16.965 --> 01:27:19.000
IN OUR SOCIETY WE MUST DO IT

01:27:19.067 --> 01:27:21.903
WITH OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS WE

01:27:21.970 --> 01:27:23.471
MUST DO IT WITH OUR CHILDREN.

01:27:23.538 --> 01:27:25.273
WE MUST MAKE SURE THAT AS WE

01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:26.774
MOVE IN THE FUTURE.

01:27:26.841 --> 01:27:28.643
THIS IS THE KIND OF BEHAVIOR

01:27:28.710 --> 01:27:31.079
THAT SOCIETY MAKES VERY CLEAR IT

01:27:31.145 --> 01:27:33.548
WILL NOT ACCEPT UNDER ANY

01:27:33.615 --> 01:27:34.749
CONDITIONS AND SO IT IS

01:27:34.816 --> 01:27:37.385
IMPORTANT FOR US TO RECOGNIZE.

01:27:37.452 --> 01:27:39.954
THE THE EVENT ITS IMPACT ON THE

01:27:40.021 --> 01:27:41.889
WOMEN WHO ARE VICTIMIZED OR

01:27:41.956 --> 01:27:43.191
OTHERS WHO ARE RAPED WE KNOW

01:27:43.257 --> 01:27:44.659
THAT WOMEN ARE NOT.

01:27:44.726 --> 01:27:46.728
EXCLUSIVELY THE VICTIMS OF THIS

01:27:46.794 --> 01:27:49.297
KIND OF HUMILIATION AND

01:27:49.364 --> 01:27:51.399
SUBJUGATION AND VIOLENCE BUT WE

01:27:51.466 --> 01:27:53.267
MUST AS A SOCIETY AND AS A

01:27:53.334 --> 01:27:55.536
LEGISLATURE BE AWARE OFF AND

01:27:55.603 --> 01:27:58.139
CONCERNED ABOUT AND TAKE ACTION.

01:27:58.206 --> 01:28:00.174
BASED UPON THE REALITIES THAT

01:28:00.241 --> 01:28:01.542
THIS IS NOT A CRIME.

01:28:01.609 --> 01:28:03.444
OF SEX THIS IS A CRIME OF

01:28:03.511 --> 01:28:04.912
VIOLENCE.

01:28:04.979 --> 01:28:06.180
AND THIS IS A CRIME OF

01:28:06.247 --> 01:28:09.484
HUMILIATION AND SUBJUGATION AND

01:28:09.550 --> 01:28:12.587
SO WHAT MANY OF US WARD CHANGE

01:28:12.654 --> 01:28:14.255
YESTERDAY.

01:28:14.322 --> 01:28:15.289
CHANGE OR FUND WHERE.

01:28:15.356 --> 01:28:16.958
BUT THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE AND

01:28:17.025 --> 01:28:18.226
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER GOING

01:28:18.292 --> 01:28:20.461
FORWARD THAT THIS BEHAVIOR HAS

01:28:20.528 --> 01:28:22.096
GOT TO BE STOPPED AND WE ARE IN

01:28:22.163 --> 01:28:23.998
A POSITION AS POLICY MAKERS TO

01:28:24.065 --> 01:28:25.466
ASSIST IN THAT EFFORT AND WITH

01:28:25.533 --> 01:28:26.834
THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK

01:28:26.901 --> 01:28:27.702

TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO SENATOR

01:28:32.273 --> 01:28:34.108
SKINNER AND WE LIKE TO RECOGNIZE

01:28:34.175 --> 01:28:35.143
SENATOR STONE.

01:28:36.744 --> 01:28:38.212
THANK YOU -- MISTER PRESIDENT

01:28:38.279 --> 01:28:40.048
MEMBERS I ALSO STAND IN SUPPORT

01:28:40.114 --> 01:28:43.518
OF THIS RESOLUTION AND I THANK

01:28:43.584 --> 01:28:45.086
MY COLLEAGUES FOR SPEAKING TO

01:28:45.153 --> 01:28:47.121
AND I APPRECIATE THAT -- OR

01:28:47.188 --> 01:28:47.889
SENATOR FROM SANTA BARBARA

01:28:47.955 --> 01:28:50.158
REFERENCED THAT IT IS NOT ONLY

01:28:50.224 --> 01:28:51.325
WOMEN WHO ARE SUBJECT TO THIS

01:28:51.392 --> 01:28:52.260
CRIME.

01:28:52.326 --> 01:28:54.062
AND I THINK THAT WE IN A FUNNY

01:28:54.128 --> 01:28:59.333
WAY THE CHOICES OF WORDS WE USE --

01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:01.636
THEY HAVE A FACTOR IN OUR

01:29:01.703 --> 01:29:03.237
LOOKING AT THIS CRIME AND BY

01:29:03.304 --> 01:29:05.273
CALLING IT SEXUAL ASSAULT WELL

01:29:05.339 --> 01:29:06.874
THAT IS ACCURATE.

01:29:06.941 --> 01:29:10.411
IT IS IT IT IS VIOLENCE AND IT

01:29:10.478 --> 01:29:11.779
IS SUBJUGATION.

01:29:11.846 --> 01:29:15.183
AND IN FACT -- MEN.

01:29:15.249 --> 01:29:18.152
AND TRANSGENDERED PEOPLE ARE

01:29:18.219 --> 01:29:20.388
SUBJECT TO THIS CRIME IN GREAT

01:29:20.455 --> 01:29:22.957
NUMBERS AND REPORT AT EVEN A

01:29:23.024 --> 01:29:25.560
LOWER PERCENTAGE THAN WOMEN DO

01:29:25.626 --> 01:29:27.829
SO WHILE WE KNOW THAT THE VERY

01:29:27.895 --> 01:29:30.431
REPORT OF RAPE AND SEXUAL

01:29:30.498 --> 01:29:30.832
ASSAULT.

01:29:30.898 --> 01:29:33.568
IS LOW AND LOW FOR WOMEN IT IS

01:29:33.634 --> 01:29:35.636
EVEN LOWER FOR MEN AND

01:29:35.703 --> 01:29:38.873
TRANSGENDER PEOPLE WHY BECAUSE

01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:40.508
OF THE SHAME.

01:29:40.575 --> 01:29:42.844
AROUND SUCH A CRIME BECAUSE OF

01:29:42.910 --> 01:29:45.480
THE FEAR THAT YOU BE CONSIDERED

01:29:45.546 --> 01:29:47.115
THAT IT YOU ASKED FOR IT FOR IT

01:29:47.181 --> 01:29:48.649
IS YOUR FAULT OR THAT YOU WOULD

01:29:48.716 --> 01:29:49.984
NOT BE BELIEVED.

01:29:50.051 --> 01:29:51.552
SO I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT

01:29:51.619 --> 01:29:53.387
FOR US TO LOOK AT THIS THROUGH A

01:29:53.454 --> 01:29:55.523
GENDER NEUTRAL LANDS AND TO LOOK

01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:57.258
AT IT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF

01:29:57.325 --> 01:29:59.527
THE VIOLENCE AND THE SUBJUGATION.

01:29:59.594 --> 01:30:01.996
THAT SUCH A CRIME IS REALLY

01:30:02.063 --> 01:30:05.700
ABOUT AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR

01:30:05.767 --> 01:30:07.001
YOUR AYE VOTE.

01:30:07.068 --> 01:30:08.636
