00:29:10.815 --> 00:29:13.017
PERENNIAL PROBLEM FOR US IN TWO

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES

00:29:26.431 --> 00:29:27.332
THE SHIP FISCALLY.

THOSE DIDN'T COME TO PASS

00:29:28.366 --> 00:29:29.601
LARGELY BECAUSE THE ECONOMY SO

WE'VE CUT THIS CORNER THAT

00:29:47.685 --> 00:29:48.987
CORNER BUT WE DON'T THINK WE CAN

00:29:49.053 --> 00:29:50.355
CUT ANYMORE WITHOUT CUTTING BONE

00:29:50.421 --> 00:29:51.322

HAVE TO LOOK AT ANOTHER OPTION I

00:30:04.869 --> 00:30:06.104
THINK POTENTIALLY GOING UP TO

00:30:06.171 --> 00:30:07.405
THREE QUARTERS OF A CENT.

00:30:07.472 --> 00:30:08.606

BUDGET PROCESS -- IN MAY OR JUNE

00:30:12.577 --> 00:30:13.411
BUT PERSONALLY I THINK IT'S BEEN

00:30:13.478 --> 00:30:14.879
FAR MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT

00:30:14.946 --> 00:30:15.647

00:32:18.436 --> 00:32:19.637
WE'RE SYMPATHETIC TO THAT

00:32:19.704 --> 00:32:21.706
OBVIOUSLY UP TO A POINT BUT WE

00:32:21.773 --> 00:32:23.074
HAVE TO REMEMBER A LOT OF THIS

00:32:23.141 --> 00:32:25.343
MONEY IS GOING TO GO TO UNFUNDED

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:26.944
PENSION LIABILITIES ESPECIALLY

00:32:27.011 --> 00:32:27.712
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A

00:32:27.779 --> 00:32:29.847
GENERAL TAX WHICH WE ARE HERE.

00:32:29.914 --> 00:32:30.848
THERE'S NO REASON THAT THIS

00:32:30.915 --> 00:32:32.550
FUNDS CAN'T BE SPENT FOR

00:32:32.617 --> 00:32:33.918
ANYTHING INCLUDING UNFUNDED

00:32:33.985 --> 00:32:35.320
PENSION LIABILITIES.

00:32:35.386 --> 00:32:36.287
AND WE JUST THINK DEALING WITH

00:32:36.354 --> 00:32:38.556
PROGRESSIVE TAXES OF THIS TYPE

00:32:38.623 --> 00:32:44.462
FOR THAT PURPOSES UNWISE SO FOR

00:32:44.529 --> 00:32:46.164

00:32:46.831 --> 00:32:48.666

IF YOU LIKE TO COME UP TO THE

00:32:49.334 --> 00:32:59.210

PARKING IS HORRENDOUS I JUST GO

00:33:01.145 --> 00:33:03.247
HERE.

00:33:03.314 --> 00:33:10.922
YEAH THE NO IT SHOULD BE ON

00:33:10.988 --> 00:33:15.193
RIGHT.

00:33:15.259 --> 00:33:15.793
AND THEN AS WE LOOK IT UP JUST

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:18.463
LIKE THAT.

00:33:18.529 --> 00:33:20.164
I'M IN A POSITION I I ASSUME

00:33:20.231 --> 00:33:23.634
WE'RE STILL IN A CA ONE NO.

00:33:23.701 --> 00:33:24.535
THOUGH THIS IS.

00:33:24.602 --> 00:33:26.237
ANOTHER BILL I SAW MR WEALTH

00:33:26.304 --> 00:33:27.839
HERE AND FIGURED THIS WAS THE

00:33:27.905 --> 00:33:29.774
ONE AND PARKING IS THE PITS OUT

00:33:29.841 --> 00:33:32.243
THERE THANK YOU.

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:35.680
HE'LL BE HERE FOR AWHILE TODAY.

00:33:35.747 --> 00:33:38.549
OKAY IS THE WHAT.

00:33:38.616 --> 00:33:40.718
ANY OTHER OPPOSITION FOR ABC SIX

00:33:40.785 --> 00:33:42.387
EIGHTEEN THING NONE.

00:33:42.453 --> 00:33:42.887
MEMBERS DO YOU HAVE ANY

00:33:42.954 --> 00:33:44.489
QUESTIONS.

00:33:44.555 --> 00:33:46.290
I HAVE A MOTION [inaudible]

00:33:46.357 --> 00:33:47.592
SECOND IT.

00:33:47.658 --> 00:33:48.192
HEY WE HAVE A MORE SECOND ANY

00:33:48.259 --> 00:33:49.660
QUESTIONS.

00:33:49.727 --> 00:33:51.129
SEEING NONE WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE

00:33:51.195 --> 00:33:52.330
I WOULD.

00:33:52.397 --> 00:33:52.997
BUT OF SHARON AND JUST BRIEFLY I

00:33:53.064 --> 00:33:53.865
FIND THE OPPOSITION A LITTLE BIT

00:33:53.931 --> 00:33:54.198
DISINGENUOUS.

00:33:54.265 --> 00:33:55.032
YES SALES TAXES ARE REGRESSIVE

00:33:55.099 --> 00:33:56.267
ABSOLUTELY AND IF WE'RE GONNA

00:33:56.334 --> 00:33:57.568
HAVE AN HONEST CONVERSATION

00:33:57.635 --> 00:33:59.237
ABOUT SALES TAX IN THE AFFECTED

00:33:59.303 --> 00:34:00.138
SALES TAXES.

00:34:00.204 --> 00:34:01.372
THE REASON THE RATE IS SO HIGH

00:34:01.439 --> 00:34:02.740
IS THE SALES AND USE TAX WAS PUT

00:34:02.807 --> 00:34:04.876
IN PLACE WHEN WE WERE PROBABLY

00:34:04.942 --> 00:34:06.277
70% GOODS ECONOMY.

00:34:06.344 --> 00:34:08.312
NOW SIT CALIFORNIA'S PROBABLY

00:34:08.379 --> 00:34:09.781
70% SERVICES ECONOMY.

00:34:09.847 --> 00:34:11.816
SO THOUGH THE RATE GOES UP

00:34:11.883 --> 00:34:14.152
BECAUSE THE BASE HAS GONE DOWN

00:34:14.218 --> 00:34:17.221
AND IF BY THEIR CONCERN FOR A

00:34:17.288 --> 00:34:18.689
REGRESSIVE TAX THE HOWARD JARVIS

00:34:18.756 --> 00:34:20.491
TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION SAYING WE

00:34:20.558 --> 00:34:21.959
SHOULD LOOK AT MAKING.

00:34:22.026 --> 00:34:22.827
SALES AND USE TAX LESS

00:34:22.894 --> 00:34:24.429
REGRESSIVE BY TAXING ACROSS THE

00:34:24.495 --> 00:34:26.030
ECONOMY I WOULD WHOLEHEARTEDLY

00:34:26.097 --> 00:34:27.465
AGREE AND I'M HOPING THAT

00:34:27.532 --> 00:34:29.967
THEY'LL BE A PARTNER TO HELP US

00:34:30.034 --> 00:34:30.568
ADDRESS THE REQUESTED MISS OF

00:34:30.635 --> 00:34:31.002
THAT.

00:34:31.068 --> 00:34:32.370
OTHER THAN THAT WE HAVE REMOVED

00:34:32.437 --> 00:34:33.771
FROM LOCAL JURISDICTIONS MANY OF

00:34:33.838 --> 00:34:35.640
THE LEVERS THAT THEY NEED IN

00:34:35.706 --> 00:34:37.809
ORDER TO FUNCTION AND TO OPERATE

00:34:37.875 --> 00:34:39.544
WE EVER SEVERELY RESTRICTED.

00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:40.945
THEIR ABILITY TO RAISE AND TAKE

00:34:41.012 --> 00:34:43.214
BENEFIT OF THEIR LOCAL PROPERTY

00:34:43.281 --> 00:34:44.882
TAXES IS ONE PROP THIRTEEN WAS

00:34:44.949 --> 00:34:46.384
PUT INTO PLACE CITIES LIKE

00:34:46.451 --> 00:34:47.985
SCOTTS VALLEY WHICH ARE VERY

00:34:48.052 --> 00:34:49.320
SMALL IN IN A RURAL AREA.

00:34:49.387 --> 00:34:50.822
HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO TAKE

00:34:50.888 --> 00:34:52.490
ADVANTAGE OF THE GROWTH OF THE

00:34:52.557 --> 00:34:54.158
VALUE OF THEIR PROPERTIES OVER

00:34:54.225 --> 00:34:56.327
THE YEARS BECAUSE OF THESE RULES

00:34:56.394 --> 00:34:58.296
THAT HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE AND

00:34:58.362 --> 00:34:59.497
REALLY STRANGLED CITIES.

00:34:59.564 --> 00:35:01.566
SO THAT THIS IS A CITY THAT HAS

00:35:01.632 --> 00:35:03.234
BEEN FISCALLY VERY RESPONSIBLE

00:35:03.301 --> 00:35:04.702
OF A CITY THAT HAS ALWAYS GONE

00:35:04.769 --> 00:35:06.270
OUT TO THE VOTERS IN A

00:35:06.337 --> 00:35:07.538
TRANSPARENT WAY.

00:35:07.605 --> 00:35:08.539
ALL WE'RE ASKING HERE TODAY IS

00:35:08.606 --> 00:35:10.007
THAT WE ALLOW THE VOTERS

00:35:10.074 --> 00:35:12.176
THEMSELVES TO ASK THE QUESTION

00:35:12.243 --> 00:35:13.611
OF THEMSELVES THAN HOLD THEIR

00:35:13.678 --> 00:35:15.146
CIVIC LEADERS ACCOUNTABLE. TO

00:35:15.213 --> 00:35:17.081
THE TO THE DECISION OF WHETHER

00:35:17.148 --> 00:35:18.549
OR NOT THEY WANT.

00:35:18.616 --> 00:35:19.917
TO RAISE THE SALES TAX NOW THEY

00:35:19.984 --> 00:35:21.819
WOULD I'M SURE LOVE TO NOT HAVE

00:35:21.886 --> 00:35:23.621
TO USE THIS PARTICULAR LEVER.

00:35:23.688 --> 00:35:24.789
BUT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OTHERS

00:35:24.856 --> 00:35:26.791
WE'VE HAD BETWEEN THE CITY IN

00:35:26.858 --> 00:35:27.391
THE COUNTY.

00:35:27.458 --> 00:35:28.526
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME DISPUTES

00:35:28.593 --> 00:35:29.927
BACK AND FORTH BECAUSE HE'S BEEN

00:35:29.994 --> 00:35:31.662
TRYING TO PROTECT ITSELF AND ITS

00:35:31.729 --> 00:35:33.331
ABILITY TO TAKE ITS FAIR SHARE.

00:35:33.397 --> 00:35:35.099
OF THAT PROPERTY TAX REVENUES

00:35:35.166 --> 00:35:36.400
BUT UNDER THE EXISTING STRUCTURE

00:35:36.467 --> 00:35:39.070
THAT HAS PROVEN IMPOSSIBLE TO DO.

00:35:39.136 --> 00:35:44.709
SO WE HAVE TO PROVIDE SOME

00:35:44.775 --> 00:35:46.143
RELIEF SOMEWHERE.

00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:47.345

THERE IS LITTLE TO NO ROOM TO

01:07:58.507 --> 01:08:00.476
TAKE IN DEPTH LOOK AT AREAS WERE

01:08:00.543 --> 01:08:02.278

OVER MY TEN YEARS ON OUR

01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:18.681
COUNTIES LAUGHTER WE HAVE DONE A

01:10:18.747 --> 01:10:20.182
NUMBER OF MUNICIPAL SERVICE

01:10:20.249 --> 01:10:21.684
REVIEWS ARE MS OURS THAT

01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:23.519
APPOINTED TO AREAS WHERE SERVICE

01:10:23.586 --> 01:10:25.154
PROVIDERS COULD GAIN

01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:26.221
EFFICIENCIES AND SERVICE.

01:10:26.288 --> 01:10:27.957
ABOUT A DOZEN YEARS AGO WE USED

01:10:28.023 --> 01:10:29.825
ALL OF OUR SPECIAL STUDIES FUNDS

01:10:29.892 --> 01:10:30.993
TO LOOK AT FIRE DISTRICTS COUNTY

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:33.596
WIDE AT A COST OF ABOUT A

01:10:33.662 --> 01:10:34.129
HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND

01:10:34.196 --> 01:10:35.164
DOLLARS.

01:10:35.230 --> 01:10:36.198
OUR STUDY POINTED TO AREAS WERE

01:10:36.265 --> 01:10:38.000
CONSOLIDATION OF SERVICES OR

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:39.435
MERGERS MIGHT MAKE SENSE TO

01:10:39.501 --> 01:10:41.303
IMPROVE THE FINANCIAL PICTURE A

01:10:41.370 --> 01:10:43.072
LONG TERM VIABILITY OF SERVICES.

01:10:43.138 --> 01:10:44.640
WE HELD HEARINGS -- WHEN

01:10:44.707 --> 01:10:45.975
PRESENTED TO EVERY FIRE DISTRICT

01:10:46.041 --> 01:10:47.176
AND FOUND THAT NONE OF THE FIRE

01:10:47.242 --> 01:10:48.644
DISTRICTS EVEN WHEN PRESENTED

01:10:48.711 --> 01:10:49.812
WITH THIS INFORMATION WERE

01:10:49.878 --> 01:10:50.646
INTERESTED IN MAKING THE

01:10:50.713 --> 01:10:51.747
ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES TO THEIR

01:10:51.814 --> 01:10:53.148
DISTRICT?

01:10:53.215 --> 01:10:55.017
IN OUR LAST ROUND OF MSR AS WE

01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:56.685
DID NOT INTEND TO DO A DETAILED

01:10:56.752 --> 01:10:58.287
STUDY OF EACH FIRE DISTRICT

01:10:58.354 --> 01:10:58.821
GIVEN THE RESPONSE OF THE

01:10:58.887 --> 01:11:00.222
PREVIOUS ROUTE PREVIOUSLY

01:11:00.289 --> 01:11:01.190
RECEIVED.

01:11:01.256 --> 01:11:02.524
BUT UNLIKE BEFORE ONE OF THE

01:11:02.591 --> 01:11:04.126
DISTRICT TOLD US THEY WERE READY

01:11:04.193 --> 01:11:05.861
TO SERIOUSLY LOOK AT THIS ISSUES.

01:11:05.928 --> 01:11:07.529
THE DISTRICT CONTAINS A SIZEABLE

01:11:07.596 --> 01:11:08.697
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY AND

01:11:08.764 --> 01:11:09.932
COUNTS ON THE FIRE DISTRICT FOR

01:11:09.999 --> 01:11:11.700
PUBLIC SAFETY AND COMMUNITY

01:11:11.767 --> 01:11:12.635
SUPPORT.

01:11:12.701 --> 01:11:13.636
WE REACHED OUT TO THE

01:11:13.702 --> 01:11:15.170
NEIGHBORING FIRE DISTRICT AND

01:11:15.237 --> 01:11:16.572
FOUND INTEREST THERE AS WELL.

01:11:16.639 --> 01:11:17.973
AT LEAST ONE BOARD WAS READY TO

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:19.642
GO AND BOTH FIRE JESTER COULD

01:11:19.708 --> 01:11:20.943
JUST LIKE OTHER FIRE CHIEFS

01:11:21.010 --> 01:11:22.511
PRESENTING A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY

01:11:22.578 --> 01:11:23.579
TO CLEAR THE HURDLES THAT

01:11:23.646 --> 01:11:24.747
USUALLY STAND IN THE WAY.

01:11:24.813 --> 01:11:26.682
OF THESE DISCUSSIONS WE HAD GOOD

01:11:26.749 --> 01:11:28.951
INTEREST BUT LOW FUNDS TO

01:11:29.018 --> 01:11:30.452
CONDUCT A STUDY THAT CAN LEAD TO

01:11:30.519 --> 01:11:33.288
BETTER SERVICES AND FINANCIAL

01:11:33.355 --> 01:11:33.789
STABILITY FOR THESE FIRE

01:11:33.856 --> 01:11:34.089
DISTRICTS.

01:11:34.156 --> 01:11:35.157
THE REASON THAT THE FIRE

01:11:35.224 --> 01:11:36.992
DISTRICT WERE INTERESTED WAS DUE

01:11:37.059 --> 01:11:38.193
TO THE INCREASING COSTS IN

01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:40.729
OPERATION OUR LOCAL LASKO

01:11:40.796 --> 01:11:42.364
HOWEVER HAD SPENT MOST OF OUR

01:11:42.431 --> 01:11:43.766
SPECIAL STUDY REVENUE.

01:11:43.832 --> 01:11:45.134
ON ARE LOOKING AT PARKS AND

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:46.735
SANITATION DISTRICT WHICH IS

01:11:46.802 --> 01:11:48.470
ALSO OUR RESPONSIBILITIES SO WE

01:11:48.537 --> 01:11:50.005
FACED A CROSSROADS.

01:11:50.072 --> 01:11:51.440
IF WE HAD A GRANT PROGRAM LIKE

01:11:51.507 --> 01:11:54.576
THE ONE ENVISIONED IN AB TWELVE

01:11:54.643 --> 01:11:55.144
FIFTY THREE THE CHOICE WOULD

01:11:55.210 --> 01:11:55.711
HAVE BEEN CLEAR.

01:11:55.778 --> 01:11:57.479
THROUGH A SUCCESSFUL APPLICATION

01:11:57.546 --> 01:11:58.614
WE COULD STUDY THE ISSUES OF

01:11:58.681 --> 01:12:00.315
INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICE DELIVERY

01:12:00.382 --> 01:12:02.985
SALARY AND BENEFITS PARITY A

01:12:03.052 --> 01:12:04.520
LONG TERM PERSONAL BENEFITS.

01:12:04.586 --> 01:12:05.654
A STUDY LIKE THIS WOULD COST

01:12:05.721 --> 01:12:07.589
ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND

01:12:07.656 --> 01:12:09.358
DOLLARS AND WOULD TAX THE BUDGET

01:12:09.425 --> 01:12:12.127
OF ALL THE THREE AGENCIES -- IF

01:12:12.194 --> 01:12:13.662
WE HAD TO DO IT OURSELVES.

01:12:13.729 --> 01:12:14.430
OF THE TOP REASON THAT LAUGH

01:12:14.496 --> 01:12:16.665
BECAUSE DO NOT INITIATE ACTIONS

THRESHOLD IN THE BILL UNDER

01:15:04.433 --> 01:15:06.168
EXISTING LAW WHEN I LAUGHED --

01:15:06.235 --> 01:15:07.636
INITIATES AN ORGANIZATION A

01:15:07.703 --> 01:15:11.940

PROTEST THE PROPOSED ACTION THIS

01:15:31.126 --> 01:15:34.062
BILL WOULD CREATE A DUPLICATE OF

01:15:34.129 --> 01:15:36.365
PROTEST THRESHOLD -- A TIERED

01:15:36.431 --> 01:15:38.734

THE EXACT SAME LASKO INITIATED

01:15:43.038 --> 01:15:45.340
THIS WOULD CONFUSE EXISTING LAW

01:15:45.407 --> 01:15:48.143

01:16:04.326 --> 01:16:06.094
THAT WOULD THAT THEORY IS BASED

01:16:06.161 --> 01:16:08.096
ON THE FACT THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:16:08.163 --> 01:16:09.831
IS GIVEN THE STATE WATER BOARD.

01:16:09.898 --> 01:16:12.701

01:17:26.241 --> 01:17:28.176
BEST TO MAINTAIN THE EXISTING

01:17:28.243 --> 01:17:30.245

01:19:20.789 --> 01:19:23.258
HISTORY ABOUT WHY THEY ARE THE

01:19:23.325 --> 01:19:24.126
WAY THEY ARE.

01:19:24.192 --> 01:19:27.329
AND SO THERE 25% WAS PUT IN

01:19:27.395 --> 01:19:29.131
PLACE MANY MANY.

01:19:29.197 --> 01:19:33.835
YEARS AGO FOR NON LAUGH CONUS

01:19:33.902 --> 01:19:34.503
SHADED ACTIONS.

01:19:34.569 --> 01:19:37.506
IT WAS BACK IN I BELIEVE

01:19:37.572 --> 01:19:38.140
NINETEEN NINETY THREE WHEN LAUGH

01:19:38.206 --> 01:19:39.541
COAST ACTUALLY WERE GIVEN THE

01:19:39.608 --> 01:19:41.343
AUTHORITY TO INITIATE ACTION IT

01:19:41.409 --> 01:19:42.577
WAS THROUGH ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:19:42.644 --> 01:19:44.980
GOTCH OF RAN A BILL.

01:19:45.046 --> 01:19:49.551
AND THE ORIGINAL BILL HAD 25% AS

01:19:49.618 --> 01:19:51.887
THE THRESHOLD SO IT MIRRORED

01:19:51.953 --> 01:19:53.622
EXISTING STATUTE.

01:19:53.688 --> 01:19:54.055
COME.

01:19:54.122 --> 01:19:57.926
UP AS WE KNOW HOW THINGS GO WHEN --

01:19:57.993 --> 01:19:59.194
WHEN THEY GO THROUGH THE

01:19:59.261 --> 01:20:00.195
LEGISLATURE?

01:20:00.262 --> 01:20:04.166
THAT WAS NEGOTIATED DOWN 210%.

01:20:04.232 --> 01:20:05.967
AN ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS WERE

01:20:06.034 --> 01:20:08.136
PLACED ON LAUGH KOS IN ORDER FOR

01:20:08.203 --> 01:20:10.305
THEM TO ACTUALLY INITIATE ACTION

01:20:10.372 --> 01:20:11.740
THAT DON'T EXIST FOR NON LAUGHED

01:20:11.806 --> 01:20:13.441
WHEN SHE DID ACTION.

01:20:13.508 --> 01:20:14.643
AT THAT AT THAT POINT IT WAS

01:20:14.709 --> 01:20:17.078
NEGOTIATED DOWN A BECAUSE FOLKS

01:20:17.145 --> 01:20:18.680
WERE AFRAID AGAIN THAT LAUGH

01:20:18.747 --> 01:20:19.814
BECAUSE WE'RE JUST GOING TO GO

01:20:19.881 --> 01:20:21.316
WILD WITH.

01:20:21.383 --> 01:20:22.751
INITIATING ACTIONS AND THE

01:20:22.817 --> 01:20:25.353
REALITY IS THAT -- COOK NOTHING

01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:27.122
COULD BE FARTHER FROM THE TRUTH

01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:29.224
I MEAN THERE PROCESSES IS

01:20:29.291 --> 01:20:31.059
DELIBERATE IT'S BEEN CREATED

01:20:31.126 --> 01:20:36.364
THAT WAY BY THE LEGISLATURE --

01:20:36.431 --> 01:20:39.067
AND OUT SO -- WHEN THE WHEN THE?

01:20:39.134 --> 01:20:44.039
THE OF LEVEL IS 10% OF IT IT IS

01:20:44.105 --> 01:20:46.208
A HUGE DETERRENT.

01:20:46.274 --> 01:20:47.275
AND SO -- WHAT?

01:20:47.342 --> 01:20:49.077
OR WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING IS FOR

01:20:49.144 --> 01:20:50.979
PURPOSES OF THIS GRANT PROGRAMS

01:20:51.046 --> 01:20:52.447
THAT IT BE TIERED AND SO FOR

01:20:52.514 --> 01:20:53.481
EXAMPLE IF.

01:20:53.548 --> 01:20:54.950
IF WE USE THE ELECTION CODE THAT

01:20:55.016 --> 01:20:57.052
IS BEING USED IF YOU HAVE A

01:20:57.118 --> 01:20:59.821
HUNDRED A HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:20:59.888 --> 01:21:01.223
REGISTERED VOTERS.

01:21:01.289 --> 01:21:02.090
I WANNA MAKE SURE I'M I'M

01:21:02.157 --> 01:21:04.192
GETTING THIS A 100% ACCURATE I

01:21:04.259 --> 01:21:05.560
HAVE HERE WITH ME.

01:21:05.627 --> 01:21:07.262
SO IF.

01:21:07.329 --> 01:21:08.630
IF THE REGISTER EFFORT IF

01:21:08.697 --> 01:21:09.831
THERE'S LESS THAN A THOUSAND

01:21:09.898 --> 01:21:11.533
REGISTERED VOTERS THE THRESHOLD

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:13.868
WOULD BE 30% AND IT IT IT TEARS

01:21:13.935 --> 01:21:15.003
FROM THERE.

01:21:15.070 --> 01:21:16.204
AND IF THERE'S A HUNDRED

01:21:16.271 --> 01:21:17.005
THOUSAND OR MORE REGISTERED

01:21:17.072 --> 01:21:20.542
VOTERS THAN THE LEVEL IS 10% SO

01:21:20.609 --> 01:21:23.745
CLEARLY THE LARGER THE COMMUNITY

01:21:23.812 --> 01:21:25.614
THE LARGER THE PROTESTS

01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:29.084
THRESHOLD IS [inaudible]

01:21:29.150 --> 01:21:32.420
MAY I SO YOU SAID IT WAS A

01:21:32.487 --> 01:21:33.788
DETERRENT.

01:21:33.855 --> 01:21:35.890
A DETERRENT TO WHO.

01:21:35.957 --> 01:21:38.593
SO -- IF FOR THE LAUGH CO TO

01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:40.295
INITIATE ACTION.

01:21:40.362 --> 01:21:43.231
ALL I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE --

01:21:43.298 --> 01:21:47.168
ONE OF ONE EXAMPLE IS -- IN ONE

01:21:47.235 --> 01:21:48.803
OF THE A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:50.572
COUNTIES THE LAUGHTER WAS

01:21:50.639 --> 01:21:52.340
LOOKING AT A NUMBER OF A FIRE

01:21:52.407 --> 01:21:53.708
PROTECTION DISTRICTS.

01:21:53.775 --> 01:21:55.877
OF FOR CONSOLIDATION AND THEY

01:21:55.944 --> 01:21:57.012
HAD DONE A MUNICIPAL SERVICE

01:21:57.078 --> 01:21:58.613
REVIEW AND THEY HAD ALL THE THE

01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:00.248
BACKUP MATERIAL.

01:22:00.315 --> 01:22:02.050
AND THEY WERE CONSIDERING --

01:22:02.117 --> 01:22:04.252
INITIATING A CONSOLIDATION OF

01:22:04.319 --> 01:22:05.587
THESE FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICTS.

01:22:05.654 --> 01:22:08.189
THERE THEY WERE VERY VERY SMALL

01:22:08.256 --> 01:22:12.360
AND SO THE THRESHOLD -- TO ANISH

01:22:12.427 --> 01:22:13.695
TO TRIGGER AN ELECTION WOULD

01:22:13.762 --> 01:22:16.431
HAVE BEEN ONE HUNDRED SIGNATURES

01:22:16.498 --> 01:22:20.268
OR PROTESTS -- ANNA TO REACH THE

01:22:20.335 --> 01:22:21.736
10% THRESHOLD.

01:22:21.803 --> 01:22:24.205
SO THE LEFT -- REALIZED THAT --

01:22:24.272 --> 01:22:25.807
THAT WITH THIS SUCH A SMALL

01:22:25.874 --> 01:22:29.844
COMMUNITY THEY KNEW THAT.

01:22:29.911 --> 01:22:30.679
IT.

01:22:30.745 --> 01:22:31.946
IT WOULD FAIL.

01:22:32.013 --> 01:22:34.716
AND O THE LAUGH CO IS THE ONE

01:22:34.783 --> 01:22:36.318
THAT INITIATES THE ACTION THEY

01:22:36.384 --> 01:22:37.919
PUT ALL OF THEIR OWN RESOURCES

01:22:37.986 --> 01:22:40.655
NOBODY FUNDS IT IT COMES OUT OF

01:22:40.722 --> 01:22:42.390
THIS SMALL LAUGH CHO BUDGET. TO

01:22:42.457 --> 01:22:44.859
PROCESS THE APPLICATION TO TO DO

01:22:44.926 --> 01:22:47.128
THE ELECTION ALL OF THOSE THINGS

01:22:47.195 --> 01:22:50.231
AND SO -- WE'RE SIMPLY ASKING

01:22:50.298 --> 01:22:52.767
FOR A LITTLE A LITTLE LENIENCY

01:22:52.834 --> 01:22:55.503
THEIR IF I COULD MAKE ONE MORE

01:22:55.570 --> 01:22:57.505
COMMENT ABOUT THE PROTEST.

01:22:57.572 --> 01:22:59.074
THIS LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION

01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:00.809
REPORT THAT WE'VE ALL A YOU KNOW

01:23:00.875 --> 01:23:02.310
HEARD ABOUT -- THAT WE WE'VE

01:23:02.377 --> 01:23:04.546
LIVED FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS NOW --

01:23:04.612 --> 01:23:05.780
THEY MADE A NUMBER OF

01:23:05.847 --> 01:23:07.115
RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO LAUGH

01:23:07.182 --> 01:23:10.218
CO AND ONE OF THEM WAS REGARDING.

01:23:10.285 --> 01:23:12.620
THE PROTEST THRESHOLDS -- WE

01:23:12.687 --> 01:23:13.988
HAVE GATHERED A GROUP OF

01:23:14.055 --> 01:23:16.324
STAKEHOLDERS AND WE ARE FORMING

01:23:16.391 --> 01:23:17.559
RIGHT NOW.

01:23:17.625 --> 01:23:20.862
A WORKING GROUP OF TO TAKE A AT

01:23:20.929 --> 01:23:22.630

01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:27.936

CONVOLUTED.

01:23:31.005 --> 01:23:34.376
UP -- BUT WE FEEL THAT -- THAT

01:23:34.442 --> 01:23:37.078
IS OF SEPARATE AND APART THAT

01:23:37.145 --> 01:23:39.647
THE THAT THIS ACTION THIS GRANT

WHAT'S CONTAINED IN THE PROGRAM

01:23:45.987 --> 01:23:46.688
IS SEPARATE FROM.

01:23:46.755 --> 01:23:49.657
THAT FULL REVIEW.

01:23:49.724 --> 01:23:50.191

OTHER QUESTIONS MAY I MAKE A

01:23:53.595 --> 01:23:55.830
CLOSING STATEMENT.

OVER 10%.

01:24:06.941 --> 01:24:08.977
LEFT GO MAY HAVE A TIGHT BUDGET

01:24:09.043 --> 01:24:10.779
I I GET THAT.

01:24:10.845 --> 01:24:13.281
AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER REVERSE I

01:24:13.348 --> 01:24:14.883
UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHERE YOU'RE

01:24:14.949 --> 01:24:16.484
COMING FROM AND I SUPPORT ALMOST

01:24:16.551 --> 01:24:18.920
I SUPPORTED ALL ALL EXCEPT FOR

01:24:18.987 --> 01:24:20.321
THE 10% HERE'S WHY.

01:24:20.388 --> 01:24:21.389
YOU HAVE A TIGHT BUDGET.

01:24:21.456 --> 01:24:23.057

01:24:23.124 --> 01:24:24.759
CITIZENS.

01:24:24.826 --> 01:24:27.095
THAT ARE PROTESTING A CHANGE TO

01:24:27.162 --> 01:24:29.531
THEIR LITTLE WORLDS OR THEIR BIG

01:24:29.597 --> 01:24:31.566
WORLD'S DEPENDING UPON.

01:24:31.633 --> 01:24:33.435
THE POPULATION LEVEL.

01:24:33.501 --> 01:24:35.570
THEY SHOULD HAVE.

01:24:35.637 --> 01:24:37.372
THE ABILITY TO PROTEST AT THE

01:24:37.439 --> 01:24:40.008
10% LEVEL BECAUSE YOU GOT MONEY

01:24:40.074 --> 01:24:41.376
THEY DON'T.

01:24:41.443 --> 01:24:43.945
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO ORGANIZE

01:24:44.012 --> 01:24:46.614
A CITIZEN PROTEST WITHOUT MONEY

01:24:46.681 --> 01:24:48.249
UNLESS THERE'S SOME OUTSIDE

01:24:48.316 --> 01:24:49.017
MONEY.

01:24:49.083 --> 01:24:50.785
SO YOU HAVE A TREMENDOUS

01:24:50.852 --> 01:24:54.722
ADVANTAGE TO ME -- THE 10% LEVEL

01:24:54.789 --> 01:24:55.690
IS FAIR.

01:24:55.757 --> 01:24:57.425
THEY HAVE A CHANCE.

01:24:57.492 --> 01:25:00.028
AND I WAS MAYOR OF A CITY FOR

01:25:00.094 --> 01:25:00.929
SIXTEEN YEARS.

01:25:00.995 --> 01:25:03.298
AND WE DID A LOT OF BUSINESS

01:25:03.364 --> 01:25:05.366
WITH LAUGH CO AND ON A FEW

01:25:05.433 --> 01:25:08.870
OCCASIONS THE CITIZENS REVOLTED.

01:25:08.937 --> 01:25:12.106
AND LOST ONE OUT OF TWO OKAY

01:25:12.173 --> 01:25:14.142
THAT I RECOLLECT.

01:25:14.209 --> 01:25:16.144
SO THE POINT I'M MAKING IS.

01:25:16.211 --> 01:25:19.013
GREAT BILL EVERYTHING BUT

01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:21.015
CHANGING THE 10% IS THERE ANY

01:25:21.082 --> 01:25:23.785
WAY THERE COULD BE AN AMENDMENT

01:25:23.852 --> 01:25:26.354
ON THAT.

01:25:26.421 --> 01:25:27.522

OR AUTHORIZATION THERE'S

01:38:25.366 --> 01:38:26.433

01:38:53.294 --> 01:38:54.461
PERSONAL TAXES ARE VERY

01:38:54.528 --> 01:38:57.131
AGGRESSIVE IN THAT IT'S THE SAME

01:38:57.197 --> 01:38:58.932
FLAT RATE AMOUNT THAT IMPACTS

01:38:58.999 --> 01:39:00.834

01:39:11.679 --> 01:39:13.080
TO WHY THE TWO THIRDS VOTE IS SO

01:39:13.147 --> 01:39:14.048
IMPORTANT.

01:39:14.114 --> 01:39:15.349

01:39:32.833 --> 01:39:34.001
THERE WAS A COMMENT THAT WAS

01:39:34.068 --> 01:39:35.302
MADE AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE ON

01:39:35.369 --> 01:39:38.572

50% OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:39:43.677 --> 01:39:44.878
THAT ACTUALLY OWNS THEIR OWN

01:39:44.945 --> 01:39:45.346
HOMES.

01:39:45.412 --> 01:39:47.414
AND I'M ONE OF THEM WE ARE

01:39:47.481 --> 01:39:49.350
BASICALLY A MINORITY.

01:39:49.416 --> 01:39:50.784
IN OTHER WORDS WE'RE THE SHEEP

01:39:50.851 --> 01:39:51.418
THAT DON'T WANT TO GET EATEN BY

01:39:51.485 --> 01:39:53.187
THE WOLVES POTENTIALLY ADDING

01:39:53.253 --> 01:39:54.788
HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS TO PROPERTY

01:39:57.424 --> 01:39:58.525
TAX.

01:39:58.592 --> 01:40:00.227
NEXT POINT THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO

01:40:00.294 --> 01:40:02.229
LIMIT TO THE NUMBER OF BONDS OR

01:40:02.296 --> 01:40:04.431

SPECIAL DISTRICTS.

01:40:08.335 --> 01:40:10.371
AGAIN THE QUESTION NEEDS REPOSE

01:40:10.437 --> 01:40:12.172
HOW DO HIGHER BONDS AND PERSONAL

01:40:12.239 --> 01:40:14.508

HOMEOWNERSHIP.

01:40:17.044 --> 01:40:18.445
AND THE ANSWER IS VERY SIMPLE

01:40:18.512 --> 01:40:21.382
THEY DO NOT.

01:40:21.448 --> 01:40:23.083
ALSO WE NEED TO QUESTION WHETHER

01:40:23.150 --> 01:40:24.952
OR NOT LOWERING THE THRESHOLD IS

01:40:25.018 --> 01:40:26.687
EVEN NECESSARY THERE HAVE BEEN

01:40:26.754 --> 01:40:28.622

TAXES HAVE OVER A 50% TAX RATE?

01:40:52.746 --> 01:40:54.448
PASS RATE SO IS IT DIFFICULT TO

01:40:54.515 --> 01:40:56.116
PASS THESE MEASURES OF COURSE IS

01:40:56.183 --> 01:40:57.951
IT IS IT IMPOSSIBLE ABSOLUTELY

THIRTEEN OKAY WE WE ARE VERY

01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:14.735
HIGH PROPERTY TAX STATE AND

01:41:14.802 --> 01:41:16.470
THAT'S PRECISELY BECAUSE OF

01:41:16.537 --> 01:41:17.938
THESE LOCAL BONDS IN PERSONAL

01:41:18.005 --> 01:41:19.840
TAXES BEING APPROVED BY VOTERS

01:41:19.907 --> 01:41:21.575
AND WHY WOULD HE MAKE THAT

01:41:21.642 --> 01:41:22.843
PROCESS EASIER.

01:41:22.910 --> 01:41:25.913
AND MEMBERS FINALLY IN CLOSING --

01:41:25.979 --> 01:41:27.414
THE ARGUMENTS BEEN NAY HEY WE

01:41:27.481 --> 01:41:28.315

01:41:31.051 --> 01:41:31.919
BALLOT.

01:41:31.985 --> 01:41:33.620
AND THE FACT REMAINS THAT TWICE

01:41:33.687 --> 01:41:35.622
IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS VOTERS

01:41:35.689 --> 01:41:38.792
HAVE DECIDED MOST RECENTLY IN

01:41:38.859 --> 01:41:40.194
TWO THOUSAND SIX PROPOSITION

01:41:40.260 --> 01:41:40.828
EIGHTY EIGHT WAS ON THE BALLOT

01:41:40.894 --> 01:41:42.262
BACK THEN.

01:41:42.329 --> 01:41:44.064
THAT WAS A FIFTY DOLLAR PERSONAL

01:41:44.131 --> 01:41:46.500
TAX INCREASE ON PRETTY MUCH ALL

01:41:46.567 --> 01:41:48.602

01:41:48.669 --> 01:41:49.369

REJECTED SEVENTY FIVE TO TWENTY

01:41:57.511 --> 01:41:58.111

01:41:58.178 --> 01:41:59.580
SPOKEN VERY VERY CARLY BOTH

01:41:59.646 --> 01:42:01.148
RECENTLY AND AGAIN THROUGH THE

01:42:01.215 --> 01:42:02.749
PPA SEE POLLS THAT THEY DON'T

01:42:02.816 --> 01:42:05.586
WANT THIS THRESHOLD WORRIED SO

01:42:05.652 --> 01:42:06.186
FOR ALL THOSE REASONS ASPIRIN

01:42:06.253 --> 01:42:07.821
OVER.

01:42:07.888 --> 01:42:09.056
OKAY FAHRRAD REPRESENTING

01:42:09.122 --> 01:42:10.457
COALITION PRODUCT WITH SCHOOL

01:42:10.524 --> 01:42:11.892
HOUSING.

01:42:11.959 --> 01:42:14.695
I IN OUR LETTER WE WERE CLEAR --

01:42:14.761 --> 01:42:16.396
WE WERE NOT ASKING FOR NOVELL

01:42:16.463 --> 01:42:17.698
TODAY WERE IN THE PROPOSAL AS

01:42:17.764 --> 01:42:18.832
AMENDED.

01:42:18.899 --> 01:42:19.566
AND THAT IS BECAUSE WE

01:42:19.633 --> 01:42:20.868
APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:42:20.934 --> 01:42:22.669
HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

01:42:22.736 --> 01:42:22.903
AUTHOR.

01:42:22.970 --> 01:42:24.538
AND OUR STAFF.

01:42:24.605 --> 01:42:26.006
WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO HAVE

01:42:26.073 --> 01:42:29.776
THOSE CONVERSATIONS.

01:42:29.843 --> 01:42:31.945
FROM A SCHOOL POINT OF VIEW.

01:42:32.012 --> 01:42:32.112
HI.

01:42:32.179 --> 01:42:34.848
WE ARE.

01:42:34.915 --> 01:42:37.417
WANTING TO BE SURE ON THE

01:42:37.484 --> 01:42:39.052
PROVISIONS THAT THERE'S A

01:42:39.119 --> 01:42:40.554
UNDERSTANDING THAT UNDER TO

01:42:40.621 --> 01:42:42.523
SCHOOL 55%.

01:42:42.589 --> 01:42:43.690
WE HAVE A CAP ON THE AMOUNT OF

01:42:43.757 --> 01:42:47.394
DEBT WE CAN ISSUE -- WE ALSO ARE

01:42:47.461 --> 01:42:49.796
CAPPED ON OUR TAX RATE.

01:42:49.863 --> 01:42:51.598
SO YOU WANT TO SEE IF WE CAN

01:42:51.665 --> 01:42:53.200
HAVE THOSE TYPES OF DISCUSSIONS.

01:42:53.267 --> 01:42:54.735
NOT IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL

01:42:54.801 --> 01:42:56.403
AMENDMENT.

01:42:56.470 --> 01:42:58.805
BECAUSE THAT'D BE TOO

01:42:58.872 --> 01:43:01.141
RESTRICTIVE AND CONSTRAINING.

01:43:01.208 --> 01:43:03.277
BUT IN SEPARATE STATUTE.

01:43:03.343 --> 01:43:04.845
I WOULD SAY IF THE AMENDMENT

01:43:04.912 --> 01:43:05.712
PASSES.

01:43:05.779 --> 01:43:09.049
THAN SIMILAR TYPES OF PROVISIONS.

01:43:09.116 --> 01:43:10.984
WOULD BE APPLICABLE.

01:43:11.051 --> 01:43:13.720
OF FOR THIS 55% HAS ARE

01:43:13.787 --> 01:43:17.024
APPLICABLE TO THE SCHOOL 55%.

01:43:17.090 --> 01:43:18.792
SO WE HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE

01:43:18.859 --> 01:43:20.294
HAVE CONVERSATIONS WE CAN

01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:23.597
CONTINUE TO DISCUSS THESE ISSUES

01:43:23.664 --> 01:43:24.898
AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT.

01:43:24.965 --> 01:43:26.633

01:43:36.443 --> 01:43:37.411
BILL.

01:43:37.477 --> 01:43:38.812
NUMBER ONE IS THAT THIS BILL

01:43:38.879 --> 01:43:40.480
COULD POTENTIALLY HARM THOSE

01:43:40.547 --> 01:43:41.949
THAT IT INTENDS TO HELP.

01:43:42.015 --> 01:43:43.951
BY FACILITATING TAX INCREASES ON

01:43:44.017 --> 01:43:46.453
BOTH SALES AND PARCEL TAXES.

01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:48.388
IT COULD POTENTIALLY INCREASE

01:43:48.455 --> 01:43:49.957
THE COST OF HOUSING CONSTRUCTION.

01:43:50.023 --> 01:43:52.693
SECONDARILY IT IMPOSES A TAX ON

01:43:52.759 --> 01:43:54.094
THOSE WORKING FAMILIES THAT IT

01:43:54.161 --> 01:43:55.696

MAY BE INADVERTENT CONSEQUENCES

01:44:03.637 --> 01:44:05.305
AS A RESULT OF FACILITATING TAX

INCREASES.

DISCRIMINATION AGAINST YOUNG

EXPLAIN THE HISTORY OF HOW WE

01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:08.462
GOT HERE -- BUT THE FACT THE

01:46:08.528 --> 01:46:09.763
MATTER IS MOST MEMBERS OF THE

01:46:09.830 --> 01:46:10.931
PUBLIC BELIEVE IN OUR DEMOCRATIC

01:46:16.737 --> 01:46:18.205
MAJORITY OF OUR COMMUNITY IS

01:46:18.271 --> 01:46:19.806

MOMENT I DO UNDERSTAND AND

OF THE BUSINESS TRADE

01:46:24.377 --> 01:46:25.479

01:46:26.079 --> 01:46:27.614
I'VE HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH

01:46:27.681 --> 01:46:30.150
BUSINESS LEADERS WHO BELIEVE.

01:46:30.217 --> 01:46:31.651
THAT OUR ECONOMY IS DEEPLY

01:46:31.718 --> 01:46:33.453
THREATEN AT THIS TIME BECAUSE OF

01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:35.489
OUR STATES LACK OF INVESTMENT IN

01:46:35.555 --> 01:46:37.190
HOUSING AND INFRASTRUCTURE THE

01:46:37.257 --> 01:46:38.492
FACT THAT WE HAVE SO MANY

01:46:38.558 --> 01:46:39.359
COMPANIES THAT ARE TRYING TO

01:46:39.426 --> 01:46:40.927
DECIDE WHETHER.

01:46:40.994 --> 01:46:42.529
THEY CAN HAVE WORKERS WHO CAN

01:46:42.596 --> 01:46:44.064
AFFORD TO LIVE NEAR THEIR JOBS

01:46:44.131 --> 01:46:45.999
WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF WORKERS

01:46:46.066 --> 01:46:46.600
WERE THINKING OF LEAVING OUR

01:46:46.666 --> 01:46:47.067
STATE.

01:46:47.134 --> 01:46:48.268
A BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE HOUSING

01:46:48.335 --> 01:46:50.003

REASONS HAPPY TO VOTE FOR THIS

RIGHT TO ANY OTHER.

01:47:03.150 --> 01:47:05.352
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THEN --

01:47:05.418 --> 01:47:06.820
I'LL I'LL JUST AT THAT -- I

01:47:06.887 --> 01:47:08.155
THINK THIS IS AN EXTREMELY

01:47:08.221 --> 01:47:10.624
IMPORTANT BILL -- TO ALL

01:47:10.690 --> 01:47:12.025
ASSOCIATE MY COMMENTS WITH THE

01:47:12.092 --> 01:47:14.494
THOSE OF OUR HOUSING CHAIR

MISTER CHIU -- AND AND JUST ADD

01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:25.238
THAT -- IT'S A CRISIS OF WE HAVE.

01:47:25.305 --> 01:47:27.140
TO MAKE A STATEMENT ABOUT

01:47:27.207 --> 01:47:27.941
WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE GOING TO

01:47:28.008 --> 01:47:30.477
TREAT IT AS A PRIORITY IN THIS

01:47:30.544 --> 01:47:34.815
HOUSE -- AND IF WE WAIT AROUND --

01:47:34.881 --> 01:47:37.184
FOR SOMETHING THAT IS A PERFECT

01:47:37.250 --> 01:47:40.053
VEHICLE THEN NOTHING WILL EVER

01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:42.722
HAPPEN -- THERE IT I THINK IT'S

01:47:42.789 --> 01:47:45.392
FAIR TO SAY THAT TO NOBODY --

01:47:45.458 --> 01:47:48.295
TAKES A RAISING FEES OR TAXES

01:47:48.361 --> 01:47:50.697
LIGHTLY -- BUT THERE ARE TIMES

01:47:50.764 --> 01:47:52.599
WHEN WE HAVE TO DO IT AND IF

01:47:52.666 --> 01:47:55.302
THIS IS NOT THAT TIME -- THEN I

01:47:55.368 --> 01:47:57.537
DON'T KNOW -- WHAT IS AND AGAIN

01:47:57.604 --> 01:47:59.406
WERE SIMPLY ALLOWING LOCAL

01:47:59.472 --> 01:48:00.707
GOVERNMENTS A LITTLE MORE

01:48:00.774 --> 01:48:02.943
FLEXIBILITY AND GETTING TO THAT

01:48:03.009 --> 01:48:06.179

01:48:09.216 --> 01:48:11.618
THIS BILL ENJOYS DO PASS

01:48:11.685 --> 01:48:12.953
RECOMMENDED SHARE.

01:48:13.019 --> 01:48:14.654
A HOME WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE.

01:48:14.721 --> 01:48:17.123
YES I WOULD I LIKE TO WHILE ONCE
