00:29:20.558 --> 00:29:22.026
ARGUMENT THAT THERE'S NOTHING

00:29:22.093 --> 00:29:24.262
IN THE BILL. TO PRECLUDE BUT

00:29:24.329 --> 00:29:25.530
THERE'S ALSO DOESN'T SEEM TO BE

TELCOS TO BE ABLE TO USE DIESEL

00:30:06.104 --> 00:30:08.573

YOU'VE BEEN VERY CLEAR ABOUT

SHOULDN'T BE DEFERRING TO THE

00:37:24.508 --> 00:37:27.411
PC. ON THESE MATTERS. THIS IS

00:37:27.478 --> 00:37:30.247
ABOUT LEGISLATING. NOT

00:37:30.314 --> 00:37:30.781
REGULATING AND WE SHOULD

00:37:30.848 --> 00:37:32.883
LEGISLATE. BUT THIS BILL IN

00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:34.919
THIS AUTHOR HAS TRIED TO BLOCK

00:37:34.986 --> 00:37:36.554
THIS FINE LINE AND SHOW

00:37:36.621 --> 00:37:39.657

IN A WAY THAT HAS- OFFENDED THE

00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:48.366
POWER OUT THERE- THAT HAS

00:37:48.432 --> 00:37:49.600
SOMEHOW STOPPED US FROM

00:37:49.667 --> 00:37:51.869
LEGISLATING IN THIS AREA. AND

00:37:51.936 --> 00:37:54.572
IT'S WORTH NOTING. I WOULD ALSO

00:37:54.639 --> 00:37:55.706
LIKE TO SAY THAT WE'VE FACED

00:37:55.773 --> 00:37:57.141

00:58:27.303 --> 00:58:29.772
I'M NOT JUST. HI GENERATE LARGE

00:58:29.839 --> 00:58:31.274
BIG GREEN ELECTROLYTIC HYDROGEN

00:58:31.341 --> 00:58:33.142
AND LOOKING AT THE PORTS. THE

00:58:33.209 --> 00:58:36.613
REASON WE- WE DIDN'T SORT OF

00:58:36.679 --> 00:58:40.083
FOCUSING ON HYDROGEN HERE- IN

00:58:40.149 --> 00:58:42.151
THE STATE IT SORT OF LIGHT DUTY

00:58:42.218 --> 00:58:46.122
FOCUSED SECTOR- THERE'S ALREADY

00:58:46.189 --> 00:58:47.690
SOMETHING I CALL THE FUEL CELL

00:58:47.757 --> 00:58:50.894
PARTNERSHIP ON UNDER ALL THE

00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:51.661
UNDER THE CURRENT INCENTIVE

00:58:51.728 --> 00:58:52.795
PROGRAMS IN THE HIGH DURING

00:58:52.862 --> 00:58:54.597
SPACE THAT IS SORT OF THE

00:58:54.664 --> 00:58:56.432
CENTRAL AUTHORITY FOR PLANNING.

00:58:56.499 --> 00:58:59.035
HYDROGEN FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE

00:58:59.102 --> 00:59:01.504
WE HAD A GOAL OF I THINK- A

00:59:01.571 --> 00:59:02.639
HUNDRED STATIONS AT ONE POINT

00:59:02.705 --> 00:59:04.274
AND NOW IT'S I THINK THE GOAL

00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:06.175
HAS INCREASED SO WE ACTUALLY

00:59:06.242 --> 00:59:07.911
WERE TRYING TO COPY THAT MODEL

00:59:07.977 --> 00:59:09.679
A LITTLE BIT HERE FOR THE

00:59:09.746 --> 00:59:11.080
ELECTRIC VEHICLE CITED DIDN'T

00:59:11.147 --> 00:59:12.649
HAVE THAT SAME AUTHORITY. BUT

00:59:12.715 --> 00:59:14.384
IF THERE'S A NEED TO THE

00:59:14.450 --> 00:59:16.119
CENTRALIZER DO ANYMORE THAT

00:59:16.185 --> 00:59:18.388

CELL AND HYDROGEN SIDE I'M I'M

00:59:22.225 --> 00:59:23.760
MORE THAN WILLING TO WORK WITH

00:59:23.826 --> 00:59:25.695
YOU ON THAT MIGHT MY SENSE FROM

STAKEHOLDERS THAT WE'VE BEEN

00:59:27.163 --> 00:59:28.965
TALKING TO IS. THEY KIND OF HAD

00:59:29.032 --> 00:59:30.833

LISTENING THE TESTIMONIAL FIND

01:28:31.406 --> 01:28:34.342
THAT IT'S VERY HARD TO FIND ANY

TWO PEOPLE AGREE ON ANYTHING

01:28:34.976 --> 01:28:38.379
RELATED TO GAME AND- BUT-

01:28:38.446 --> 01:28:40.982
GAMINE IS EXTREMELY EXTREMELY

01:28:41.049 --> 01:28:43.317
LUCRATIVE BUT IT'S ALSO A VICE

01:28:43.384 --> 01:28:46.220
AND IT'S WELL KNOWN TO HAVE

01:28:46.287 --> 01:28:48.923
CERTAIN SOCIAL IMPACTS ARE- YOU

01:28:48.990 --> 01:28:52.694

MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY SO

01:28:55.930 --> 01:28:57.732
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT OBVIOUSLY

01:28:57.799 --> 01:28:59.400
REQUIRES ITS ITS ITS HEAVY

01:28:59.467 --> 01:29:03.071
REGULATION- CALIFORNIA WAS

01:29:03.137 --> 01:29:04.872
DIVIDE IS A VERY DIVERSE STATE

01:29:04.939 --> 01:29:06.741
WE PRIDE OURSELVES OF HAVING

01:29:06.808 --> 01:29:08.543
SUCH A DIVERSIFIED ECONOMY THAT

01:29:08.609 --> 01:29:11.479
AGES MAKES US THE MOST

01:29:11.546 --> 01:29:12.046
PROSPEROUS BUT STATEMENT THE

01:29:12.113 --> 01:29:14.082
NATION. MANY PEOPLE IN

01:29:14.148 --> 01:29:16.150
CALIFORNIA I GUESS WOULD BE

01:29:16.217 --> 01:29:17.852
VERY HAPPY TO SEE NEVADA STYLE

01:29:17.919 --> 01:29:18.886
GAMING BUT THAT IS NOT

01:29:18.953 --> 01:29:20.488
CALIFORNIA I THINK CALIFORNIA

01:29:20.555 --> 01:29:23.057
REQUIRES. SOME LEVEL OF

01:29:23.124 --> 01:29:25.126
MODERATION IN THIS INDUSTRY.

01:29:25.193 --> 01:29:27.462
HOWEVER THERE'S ONE PROVISION

01:29:27.528 --> 01:29:29.030
OF THE BILL THAT I HAVE A

01:29:29.097 --> 01:29:31.666
PROBLEM WITH IN THE THAT

01:29:31.733 --> 01:29:32.266
PROVIDES AT THE CITY COUNTY OR

01:29:32.333 --> 01:29:34.669
CITY. AND COUNTIES

01:29:34.736 --> 01:29:35.603
JURISDICTIONAL LIMIT MAY

01:29:35.670 --> 01:29:37.438
EXPAND. TO ACCOMMODATE THE

01:29:37.505 --> 01:29:38.940
INCREASE OF GAMING TABLES

01:29:39.006 --> 01:29:41.743
PERCENT TO THE SECTION. AND YOU

01:29:41.809 --> 01:29:43.711
KNOW I'M IT'S NOT THAT I'M NOT

01:29:43.778 --> 01:29:46.380
IN A OPPOSED TO A PROCESS OF

01:29:46.447 --> 01:29:50.084
REEVALUATING. THE AMOUNT OF

01:29:50.151 --> 01:29:52.019
TABLES PER COUNTY BUT IT'S-

01:29:52.086 --> 01:29:54.555
PROVIDING THAT. A CITY OR

01:29:54.622 --> 01:29:58.593
COUNTY- MAY EXAMINE THAT AND

01:29:58.659 --> 01:29:59.994
FOR MEANT THAT I HAVE A BIG

01:30:00.061 --> 01:30:01.162
PROBLEM WITH THAT IN A IN A

01:30:01.229 --> 01:30:02.864
STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA THIS DOES

01:30:02.930 --> 01:30:05.733
SO DIVERSE. IF YOU ACTUALLY

01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:07.502
LOOK AT A MAP OF CALIFORNIA

01:30:07.568 --> 01:30:10.805
YOU'LL FIND. THAT WE HAVE SOME

01:30:10.872 --> 01:30:14.041
COUNTIES THAT ARE ENORMOUS BUT

01:30:14.108 --> 01:30:16.644
BARELY HAVE A FEW PEOPLE IN ON

01:30:16.711 --> 01:30:18.312
SOME THAT ARE VERY SMALL.

01:30:18.379 --> 01:30:19.547
EXTREMELY SMALL COUNTIES LIKE

01:30:19.614 --> 01:30:22.216
THE COUNTY OF ALPINE WITH HAS A

01:30:22.283 --> 01:30:23.851
THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE.

01:30:23.918 --> 01:30:27.555
WHOSE ENTIRE COUNTY- I MEAN

01:30:27.622 --> 01:30:28.890
EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT. OF THE

01:30:28.956 --> 01:30:30.725
ENTIRE COUNTY OF ALPINE IS

01:30:30.792 --> 01:30:32.693
OWNED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:35.363
THIS IS FEDERALLY OWNED LAND.

01:30:35.429 --> 01:30:36.964
YOU TAKE THAT AND YOU COMPARE

01:30:37.031 --> 01:30:39.500
THAT TO L. A. COUNTY. THAT IS-

01:30:39.567 --> 01:30:41.903
A FLOW OF MODERATELY SIZED

01:30:41.969 --> 01:30:42.470
COUNTY BUT WITH TEN MILLION

01:30:42.537 --> 01:30:45.072
PEOPLE. OR LOOK COMPARE THAT TO

01:30:45.139 --> 01:30:46.741
A VERY VERY SMALL COUNTY AS A

01:30:46.808 --> 01:30:50.745
SAN FRANCISCO WITH. A SEVEN

01:30:50.812 --> 01:30:51.479
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE

01:30:51.546 --> 01:30:54.849
WITH THAT IS CURRENTLY THE MOST

01:30:54.916 --> 01:30:56.818
DENSE PART OF OUR STATE. YOU

01:30:56.884 --> 01:30:58.419
SEE THAT IT'S VERY HARD TO

01:30:58.486 --> 01:31:00.688
DRAFT THE POLICY THAT- COVERS

01:31:00.755 --> 01:31:01.889
EVERY PART OF THE STATE AND IF

01:31:01.956 --> 01:31:03.591
YOU GIVE THE POWER TO THE LOCAL

01:31:03.658 --> 01:31:06.427
LEVEL TO REALLY. LEAD TO A OVER

01:31:06.494 --> 01:31:08.830
CONCENTRATION OF GAMING IN SOME

01:31:08.896 --> 01:31:10.364
PARTS OF THE STATE VERSUS.

01:31:10.431 --> 01:31:12.767
OTHERS IN SOME PARTS OF THE

01:31:12.834 --> 01:31:13.401
STATE THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE CAME

01:31:13.467 --> 01:31:15.837
IN WILL HAVE. A MORE THAN THEIR

01:31:15.903 --> 01:31:17.705
FAIR SHARE AND I THINK. THE

01:31:17.772 --> 01:31:19.273
STATE OF CALIFORNIA REQUIRES A

01:31:19.340 --> 01:31:21.275
POLICY THAT WILL. EQUALLY

01:31:21.342 --> 01:31:24.512
DISTRIBUTE. GAMING OR AT LEAST

01:31:24.579 --> 01:31:26.514
TO FIND A WAY TO ACTUALLY.

01:31:26.581 --> 01:31:28.716
MINIMIZE ITS NEGATIVE IMPACT

01:31:28.783 --> 01:31:31.485
AND MAXIMISE ITS ECONOMIC

01:31:31.552 --> 01:31:33.354
BENEFIT I THINK THERE'S A WAY.

01:31:33.421 --> 01:31:37.959
TO DO THAT AND WE HAVE A DOUBLE

01:31:38.025 --> 01:31:40.061
TIER SYSTEM I WAS HERE LAST

01:31:40.127 --> 01:31:44.065
TIME WE- ADVANCE THIS AND- AND

01:31:44.131 --> 01:31:46.133
IT JUST SEEMS THAT EVERY SINGLE

01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:47.535
TWO OR THREE OR FOUR YEARS WERE

01:31:47.602 --> 01:31:49.070
KICKING THE CAN DOWN. THE ROAD

01:31:49.136 --> 01:31:52.340
ON ON. EXAMINING HOW ARE STATE

01:31:52.406 --> 01:31:54.809
ISSUES THESE LICENSES HOW WE

01:31:54.876 --> 01:31:57.845
TREAT GAMING- WHEN IT COMES TO

01:31:57.912 --> 01:32:00.014
THE TRIBES THEY'RE REQUIRED TO

01:32:00.081 --> 01:32:01.649
COME INDIVIDUALLY AND GET A

01:32:01.716 --> 01:32:03.818
COMPACT TO VERY EXPENSIVE AND

01:32:03.885 --> 01:32:05.686
DIFFICULT PROCESS THAT REQUIRES

01:32:05.753 --> 01:32:07.922
LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL. AND AT

01:32:07.989 --> 01:32:09.757
THE LOCAL LEVEL THEY'RE THEY'RE

01:32:09.824 --> 01:32:11.659
SUBJECT TO THIS PROCESS WHICH

01:32:11.726 --> 01:32:14.495
SEEMS TO BE. STATUS QUO YEAR IN

01:32:14.562 --> 01:32:17.999
YEAR A YEAR AFTER YEAR AND- I

01:32:18.065 --> 01:32:20.768
THINK THIS BILL- I THINK IT'S

01:32:20.835 --> 01:32:21.903
AN IMPORTANT BILL IT'S AN

01:32:21.969 --> 01:32:23.404
IMPORTANT MEASURE I THINK IT

01:32:23.471 --> 01:32:25.373
NEEDS TO MOVE FORWARD I'M GONNA

01:32:25.439 --> 01:32:28.743
SUPPORTED TODAY. BUT OF I HATE

01:32:28.809 --> 01:32:30.611
TO OVERBURDEN THE AUTHOR AND

01:32:30.678 --> 01:32:32.647
ASK HIM TO COMPLETELY REDESIGN.

01:32:32.713 --> 01:32:35.049
THE PROCESS BUT AT LEAST IN

01:32:35.116 --> 01:32:35.583
THIS BILL WE SHOULD ADD A

01:32:35.650 --> 01:32:39.186
PROVISION THAT- THE- AS FOR A

01:32:39.253 --> 01:32:40.888
STUDY TO RE EXAMINE HOW WE

01:32:40.955 --> 01:32:44.492
APPROVE GAMING CALIFORNIA AND

01:32:44.558 --> 01:32:46.494
IF IT'S GOING TO INCREASE IT

01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:48.162
SHOULD INCLUDE THE THAT THE I

01:32:48.229 --> 01:32:50.097
DON'T THINK THE GAME ROOM

01:32:50.164 --> 01:32:51.832
SHOULD BE TREATED INDEPENDENTLY.

01:32:51.899 --> 01:32:53.434
OF THE TRIBES IN TERMS OF HOW

01:32:53.501 --> 01:32:55.002
THEY'RE APPROVED AND HOW THEIR

01:32:55.069 --> 01:32:57.238
AUTHORIZED BECAUSE AS- AS WE'VE

01:32:57.305 --> 01:32:59.807
UP SEEING HOW WE APPROVED

01:32:59.874 --> 01:33:01.075
GAMING HERE THERE IS AND THERE

01:33:01.142 --> 01:33:03.678
JUST SEEMS TO BE ONE PROCESS.

01:33:03.744 --> 01:33:04.612
FOR THE TRIBES AT ANOTHER

01:33:04.679 --> 01:33:06.213
PROCESS FOR THE GAME AND FISH

01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:08.416
WHICH I THINK IS JUST PATENTLY

01:33:08.482 --> 01:33:10.384
UNFAIRNESS IS BASED ON. THE

01:33:10.451 --> 01:33:14.855
STATE'S. HISTORY OF TREATING

01:33:14.922 --> 01:33:15.456
PEOPLE SEPARATELY ON THE SPARE

01:33:15.523 --> 01:33:18.893
LEE. AND ANOTHER UNEQUALLY AND

01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:20.094
I THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AT THIS

01:33:20.161 --> 01:33:22.263
INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE AND IT

01:33:22.330 --> 01:33:24.465
REALLY EVALUATE ITS IMPACT ON

01:33:24.532 --> 01:33:25.533
THE STATE AND WHETHER CERTAIN

01:33:25.599 --> 01:33:27.435
AREAS ARE HAVE AN OVER

01:33:27.501 --> 01:33:30.204
CONCENTRATION OR NOT. AND I

01:33:30.271 --> 01:33:33.007
JUST WANTED TO EXPRESS THAT NOW

01:33:33.074 --> 01:33:34.475
LOOKING AT THIS BILL HOPEFUL

01:33:34.542 --> 01:33:37.411

01:33:42.283 --> 01:33:45.720
PROCESS. THAT ONE THAT THAN

01:33:45.786 --> 01:33:46.320

THAT OUTLINES HOW WE DEAL WITH

01:33:54.729 --> 01:33:56.397

I'VE BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE

01:34:05.673 --> 01:34:08.209
SIX. YEARS I THINK THIS IS THE

01:34:08.275 --> 01:34:10.277
THIRD EXTENSION WE'VE SEEN SOME

01:34:10.344 --> 01:34:12.179
SHORT EXTENSIONS NOW WE'RE

01:34:12.246 --> 01:34:13.781
SEEING A WHOLE LOT LONGER

01:34:13.848 --> 01:34:16.350
EXTENSIONS. BUT IT'S A BALANCE

01:34:16.417 --> 01:34:18.786
BETWEEN SMALL CARD ROOMS MEDIUM

01:34:18.853 --> 01:34:22.156

PEOPLE THAT DON'T WANT. ANY
