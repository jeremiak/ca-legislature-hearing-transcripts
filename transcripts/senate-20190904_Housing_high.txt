I'M HAPPY TO BE BACK PRESENTING THIS BILL TO AND I WANNA JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN AND ESPECIALLY SENATOR MCGUIRE FOR YOUR DEEP ENGAGEMENT ON THIS AND HELPING US TO CHART. A NONTRADITIONAL PATH FOR THIS BILL AS A REFRESHER AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN IS A REGIONAL BEAR A BILL TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING CRISIS IN THE BAY AREA REGION. THE INTENT OF THIS BILL HAS BEEN TO ENABLE THE BAY AREA TO HELP ITSELF TO GIVE OUR NINE COUNTY REGION THE AUTHORITY TO RAISE FUNDING. FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING SIMILAR TO HOW OUR REGION HAS LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY TO RAISE MONIES FOR TRANSPORTATION. AS WELL AS FOR RESTORATION OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY.THE HOPE IS THAT THIS AUTHORITY WILL HELP ADDRESS OUR HOUSING CRISIS WE CONTINUE TO SUFFER FROM THE STATE'S HIGHEST HOME PRICES. RECORD RENTS RECORD EVICTIONS AND RECORD HOMELESSNESS LEVELS. THE LAST TIME WE WERE IN THIS COMMITTEE IN MID JUNE THE REGIONAL AGENCIES WERE IN THE MIDST OF CONSIDERING RECOMMENDING AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL. THAT WOULD CONVEY THE SUPPORT OF A BROAD RANGE OF CITIES AND COUNTIES IN THE BEER. SINCE THAT TIME THE REGIONAL AGENCIES HAVE CONCLUDED THE PROCESS. AND IN JULY I'M PLEASED TO REPORT THAT THEY VOTED TO SUPPORT THE BILL. WITH SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS BY A VOTE OF TWENTY TO THREE. AT A BAG THE ASSOCIATION BAY AREA GOVERNMENTS AND BY THIRTEEN THREE VOTE. AT THE END TO SEE THE MEASURE TO METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. WE HAVE SINCE INCORPORATED THEIR PROPOSED AMENDMENTS AND WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH SENATOR MCGUIRE TO ADDRESS CONCERNS. THAT HE AND OTHERS HAVE ALSO REYES WITH THE BILL. MANAGER SHARE SOME OF THE HIGH LEVEL DETAILS OF THE BILL. IN TERMS OF GOVERNANCE. WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE CREATING A NEW REGIONAL AGENCY OR BUREAUCRACY WITH THIS BILL. INSTEAD ALL MAJOR DECISIONS RELATED TO REVENUES EXPENDITURES EXCEPT FOR WILL BE MADE BOTH BY A BAG AN MTC. WITH A BAG AS THE LEAD AGENCY. IN TERMS OF REVENUE. THE SHARE FUNDS TO BE DISTRIBUTED DIRECTLY TO COUNTIES HAS BEEN INCREASED BY FROM 75% TO AT LEAST EIGHTY PERCENT. REFLECTING THE DESIRE FOR HIGHER RETURNS SOURCE. WITH THE REMAINING 20% TO GO TO REGIONAL POOL. THE EXCEPTION IS A POTENTIAL TAX EMPLOYMENT WHERE POLL. WHICH ENABLES OUR REGION TO SUPPORT CITIES AT FACE THE BURDEN OF HOUSING THE WORK FORCE. WITHOUT TAX REVENUES THAT THESE JOBS WOULD PROVIDE. ADDITIONALLY THE THREE LARGEST CITIES IN THE REGION WOULD GET THEIR ALLOCATION OF FUNDS FOR THEIR COUNTIES REFLECTING THEIR DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE BURDEN. OF BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. OTHER CITIES IN THE REGION WOULD GET GUARANTEED FUNDING OF THEY HAVE MORE THAN CAMINO NUMBERS. IN TERMS OF EXPENDITURE. AT LEAST TWO THIRDS OF THE FUNDING AT THE REGIONAL COUNTY LEVELS MUST BE. DEDICATED TO PRODUCTION AND PRESERVATION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND MONIES COULD ALSO BE SPENT ON TENT PROTECTIONS INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND STAFF SUPPORT. WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THESE CHANGES. AND OUR REGION WIDE COLLABORATION AND I WANT TO JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO THANK THE MANY STAKEHOLDERS THROUGHOUT THE BAY AREA AS WELL AS ALL OF YOU. FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR WITNESS. FROM THE MTC REBEKAH LAW. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO GOOD EVENING AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE I'M THE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS MANAGER FOR M. T. C. AND A BAG. AND WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO REACH THIS STAGE IN THIS LONG PROCESS WE HAD A VERY COLLABORATIVE. PROCESS AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL THERE WERE A LOT OF CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL WHEN IT FIRST WAS INTRODUCED BY MANY LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS INCLUDING. ON MANY OF THEM ON OUR BOARD. WE HAD AN AD HOC COMMITTEE THAT FOCUSED ON THE GOVERNANCE QUESTIONS BECAUSE THAT IN PARTICULAR WAS A VERY THORNY ONE WHO'S GOING TO DO WHAT. WE HAVE ONE STAFF THAT SERVES TWO DIFFERENT BOARDS. AND ULTIMATELY AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO DESCRIBED WE ARE GOING TO HAVE BOTH BOARDS. ON MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT EVERY ASPECT. OF THIS PROGRAM. AND SO WE HAD A NUMBER OF SPECIFIC AMENDMENTS THEY HAVE ALL BEEN INCORPORATED ON WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU IN CENTER MCGUIRE FOR WORKING CLOSELY ON WITH OUR- OWN BOARD MEMBERS AND WITH OTHER ELECTED OFFICIALS IN THE REGION.

MAYBE ONLY ONE CHAIR WITH LONG INCOME BACK. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MICHAEL GUNNING WITH THE C. B. I A ONE OF MY FAVORITE GOLF MOVIES IS CADDYSHACK AND I FEEL LIKE THE KID THAT THROUGH THE- ROOF DAY BABY RUTH IN THE POOL RIGHT NOW. COME IN COME IN HERE BUT- I GUESS FOR ALL THAT OUR MEMBERSHIP PARTICIPATED IN THE IN THE CASA AGREEMENT. AND WE LEFT THERE WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT NEW HOUSING RESIDENTIAL HOUSING WOULD NOT BE INCLUDED. AS A TAX BASE FOR THIS AND SO WHY ARE OPPOSITION HERE CENTERS AROUND THAT. IN FACT I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT PAGE THIRTEEN IT'S SPECIFICALLY SAYS OF THE BILL. THAT THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING NEED TO THE REGION ACROSS COMMERCIAL DEVELOPERS. BUSINESSES ABOVE A CERTAIN SIDE TAXPAYERS AND PROPERTY OWNERS WITHIN THE REGION NOT NECESSARILY NEW RESIDENTIAL HOUSING. SO FOR ME THE US IS DIFFICULT. CHAIRMAN CHOOSE A FRIEND AND WE CERTAINLY WANT TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT I THINK OUR OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED REALLY HAS TO DEAL WITH IF THERE'S A WAY TO CARVE OUT. NEW RESIDENTIAL HOUSING THAT'S WHAT OUR GOAL IS HERE AND CERTAINLY WANT TO WORK WITH BOTH FUTURE MCGUIRE AND YOU MISTER JUNIOR TO FIGURE THAT OUT. OKAY THANK YOU ALEX GIVES HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE TWO. MY APOLOGIES OF COURSE THERE. AN OPPOSITION GREAT THANK YOU YES ALEX GIVE HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CITIES OF DANVILLE PLEASANTON LAFAYETTE AND WALNUT CREEK WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING WITH US BUT OUR CONCERNS REALLY STAND WITH THE RETURN TO SOURCE. THANK YOU GREAT THANK YOU. ANY OTHER OPPOSITION. OKAY WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE SO IF I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT THE AUTHOR AND I AND CENTER MCGUIRE WERE ALL I TRY TO BE FOR THE HEARING I AM GLAD AND I UNDERSTAND THE BEING CAN DURING CONVERSATIONS WITH WITH CVI A ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE COULD YOU ME BABY SISTER ELABORATE ON YOUR THINKING AROUND THIS ISSUE CERTAINLY IN ALSO A FEW THINGS I WAS JUST PERSONALLY APPRISED OF THE DETAILS OF THIS ISSUE REALLY A FEW HOURS AGO I HAD BEEN HEARD A FEW DAYS AGO THERE MIGHT BE SOME QUESTIONS SAID BEEN EXPECTING A PHONE CALL THE WEEKEND IT DIDN'T HAPPEN HERE WE ARE TODAY. A FEW THINGS IT IS NOT BEEN OUR INTENT TO TARGET AND TAX RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT WHAT I UNDERSTAND WE'RE BEING ASKED TO DO IS TO CARVE OUT OF THE APPLICATION OF GENERAL TAXES FOR A SPECIFIC SEGMENT THAT IS REPRESENTED BY BY MR GUNNING AND I WILL SAY A FEW THINGS ABOUT THAT FIRST THIS BILL HAS BEEN A DISCUSSION INTENSE DISCUSSION AROUND THE BAY AND HERE IN THE CAPITAL AND A PORTION OF THIS IS VERY LAST MINUTE WHAT I'D COMMITTED TO THE PUBLIC WAS TO WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH A BAG AN EMPTY SEE ON THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE ARE ACCEPTING TODAY. THIS IS SIMPLY JUST NOT AN ISSUE THAT WE HAVE DISCUSSED I WISH THAT WE'VE HAD TIME BUT BUT BUT WE DON'T SECONDLY EIGHT THERE WAS A SUGGESTION ABOUT WHAT WAS DISCUSSED AT CASA AND REGARDLESS OF WHAT WAS DISCUSSED ACOSTA OR NOT THIS IS THIS IS A STAND ALONE BILL THIS BILL IS FRANKLY THAT MANY MANY ELEMENTS OF IT ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT CASA WAS ABOUT BUT I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THAT POINT AND THEN I WOULD JUST AND WITH. ITS TYPICALLY VERY UNPRECEDENTED TO CARVE UT AN INDUSTRY FROM AGAIN GENERAL TAXATION I THINK WE SHOULDN'T DO THAT LATELY I DO THINK THERE'S A CONVERSATION WE HAD AND I JUST WILL AND WITH THIS POINT WHICH IS IT'S NOT MY INTENT THAT IF THERE REVENUES TO BE RAISED IN THE BAY AREA FOR HOUSING THAT WE DO IT IN A WAY THAT WOULD SOMEHOW. IMPEDE NEW HOUSING CONSTRUCTION THAT WOULD BE. COMPLETELY COUNTERINTUITIVE SO I THINK WE- SHARE THE SAME GOALS WHAT I TOLD MR GOING. I IS IF WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO FIGURE OUT THE MAN THAT THAT MAKES SENSE ALL PARTIES I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT. THAT I WE WOULD BE WILLING IF WE CAN GET TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF THIS. TO CONSIDER A LETTER TO THE JOURNAL THIS TOPIC AND A VERY MUCH. WILL WILL CERTAINLY BE WORKING. SEE TO SEE IF WE CAN GET THERE BUT- THOSE ARE MY COMMENTS. AND I APPRECIATE THAT ALL TURNED OVER TO THE CENTER MCGUIRE ON. I AND IT IS OBSERVE A LAST MINUTE THING SO I AM. AS SOMEONE WHO IS ALSO AN AUTHOR. I UNDERSTAND THAT IS. A HARD. ON I ALSO KNOW THAT YOUR RECENTLY REPORT CAME OUT. A MONTH AGO. SHOWING THE VERY VERY HEAVY. OCT THE LOAD ON RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT AND CALIFORNIA. WITH HUGE DISPARITIES AMONG US CITIES AND- I ENDING UP. MAKING HOUSING MORE EXPENSIVE. AND SO IT'S SOMETHING IS AN ISSUE THAT I'M MINDFUL OF I KNOW THAT THE AUTHOR IS MINDFUL OF A AND- SO I. APPRECIATE YOU CONTINUING THE AND NOT DIALOGUE TO SEE IF THERE IS. A WAY TO RESOLVE THOSE. SENATE MCGUIRE. SO MUCH WAS THAT YOUR FIRST THOUGHT WHEN I TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THINK OF THE CHAIR WHO IS. A BEEN DEEPLY ENGAGED IN THIS PROCESS TRAVELING. TO MEETINGS TO ENSURE ALL OF US WERE AT THE TABLE. WITH LOCAL ELECTED LEADERS BY THE WAY IN TO SEE NAY BAG ESTABLISH AN AD HOC COMMITTEE. THAT MET WITH THE CHAIR THE CHAIR OF ASSEMBLY HOUSING MYSELF ON AND WE'VE HAD MORE CONFERENCE CALLS IN PERSON MEETINGS TO BE ABLE TO WORK THROUGH THIS ISSUE. I WANNA TAKE A MOMENT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AS THE NUMBER TWO SIMILAR TO I IS A WARRIOR. HE TAKES ON BIG ISSUES LIKE THIS AT WITH MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDER HOLDERS TRY TO DRIVE CONSENSUS NAY BELIEVE WHAT YOU SEE IN FRONT OF US TODAY. IS THE FRUITS OF A CONSENSUS DRIVEN PROCESS AS HAD MULTIPLE VOICES OF THE TYPE TABLE AND BY THE WAY. FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS IN ORGANIZATIONS. SO IF IT'S OKAY MISTER CHAIR JUST SHARING CANDIDLY SOME FRUSTRATION AS WE SIT HERE TONIGHT AT TEN TO EIGHT. WE HAVE BEEN VERY CAUTIOUS WE BEING THE AUTHOR THE CHAIR OF HOUSING IN MYSELF ABOUT NOT. CREATING ANY TYPE OF SIDE DEALS THE PROCESS THAT'S BEEN ESTABLISHED BY AND HE'S SEEN A BAG IS THAT DAY HAVE APPOINTED AN AD HOC. THAT AD HOC WOULD BRING BACK RECOMMENDATIONS FROM WORKING MEETINGS WHICH WOULD THEN BE ADOPTED BY MTC METROPOLITANS PETITION COMMISSION AND THE ASSOCIATION OF BAY AREA GOVERNMENTS. THERE'S BEEN DEEP ENGAGEMENT BY THAT I AD HOC. WE HAVE HAD DEEP ENGAGEMENT WITH MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS EVERYTHING FROM NONPROFIT HOUSING DEVELOPERS A FOR PROFIT HOUSING DEVELOPERS CITIES AND COUNTIES TENETS. ORGANIZATIONS YOU NAME IT THEY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS AND WHILE WE HAVE NOT ALWAYS AGREED ON ALL ISSUES WE WERE ABLE TO COME TO THE AGREEMENT THAT YOU SEE IN FRONT OF US HERE TONIGHT. WE ESTABLISH A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS WITH DEEP ENGAGEMENT FROM CITIES AND COUNTIES ACROSS THE BAY AREA BY THE WAY. MULTIPLE VOICES WITH DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS AND AS WE ALL KNOW ANYONE WHO'S BEEN FOCUSED ON HOUSING. NOT EASY TO DRIVE CONSENSUS. I WILL CHARACTERIZE THIS IS A LAST MINUTE BOND. AND QUITE FRANKLY IT'S A LUDICROUS APPROACH. WE HAVE. SO I WILL SPEAK FOR MYSELF GOVERNS IN FINANCE. HI THE CONSULTANT GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE HAVE NOT HEARD FROM THIS ORGANIZATION WITH ALL DUE RESPECT FOR THE REPRESENTATIVE BECAUSE HE IS FANTASTIC WHAT HE DOES. BUT FOR THE ORGANIZATION WE HAVE NOT HEARD FROM THEM. THE FIRST THING THAT WE HEAR FROM IS AN HOUR AGO. AN HOUR AGO. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. THERE HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE OPPORTUNITIES BOTH WORKING WITH CHAIR OF HOUSING UP FROM BOTH THE ASSEMBLY INNOCENT. TO WORK WITH US TO BE ABLE TO BE PART OF THIS COLLABORATIVE PROCESS NOT ONCE HAS THIS EVER HAPPENED I CAN JUST SPEAK FOR MYSELF UP FOR GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE THERE ARE ALSO PUBLIC MEETINGS IN WHICH ORGANIZATIONS PARTICIPATING OR COULD ATTENDED. THAT DID NOT HAPPEN. SO I WANNA MAKE A NOTE. THAT IN THIS BILL IF THERE NEEDS TO BE A FURTHER DISCUSSION ABOUT TAXES IT COULD BE HAD AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. ALL THIS BILL IS DOING. IS ALLOWING THE VOTERS IN THE BAY AREA TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A DECISION ON REVENUE OPTIONS. IT IS ESSENTIALLY A PROVIDES CHOICES FOR A BAG IN IN DC TO BE ABLE TO PICK AND CHOOSE FROM. EVERYTHING THAT WOULD BE OUR IN FOR EVERYTHING THAT IS IN FRONT OF US TONIGHT WOULD ALL HAVE TO BE VOTER APPROVED WHICH MEANS THERE CAN BE. A IN DEPTH DISCUSSIONS AT THE A BAG IN IN DC LEVEL AND BY THE WAY BOTH BOARDS HAVE TO APPROVE BEFORE ANYTHING IS PUT ON THE BALLOT. ON THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE. BUT QUITE CANDIDLY I HAVE NO APPETITE WITH A ONE HOUR NOTICE PRIOR TO THIS WITH OPPOSITION THE BILL TO TAKE ANYTHING UP HERE THIS EVENING. AND OUR FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK THIS IS. LESS THAN LAST MINUTE NIGHT WILL GET OFF THE FRUSTRATION BOX HERE IN JUST SAY HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE BOTH AT THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE AND SENT OVER TO FOR ALL THE WORK AND I DO LOOK FOR TO BE IN A SIT DOWN C. B. I A TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION. THEY DO GREAT WORK THERE ADVOCATING FOR HOUSING. ACROSS THE STATE BUT ON THIS ONE ISSUE I HAVE TO DISAGREE. I CENTERS SKINNER THANK YOU. BUT WE'VE ALL BEEN IN THIS KIND OF CIRCUMSTANCE NONE OF US LIKE TO BE IN A SITUATION WHERE SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN WORKED ON FOR. CLOSE TO A YEAR NOW. GETS A LAST MINUTE OPPOSITION LETTER THAT. FROM FROM AN ORGANIZATION THAT IS BOTH RESPECTED AND CARRIES CONSIDERABLE WEIGHT BUT THE THING THAT I WANT TO CLARIFY IS SO MISTER WHERE YOU MAY HAVE BEEN REFERENCING THIS BUT- AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND IT. THIS BILL IT'S NOT JUST THAT SOMETHING HAS TO HAVE VOTER APPROVAL BUT WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS OFF THE RICE. MT SEEN A BACK. TO DEVELOP VOTER MEASURES. AND THEY COULD ANY GIVES THEM THE TYPE OF. OF TAX POSSIBILITIES BUT IT DOES NOT SAY. AND THIS IS WHERE I WANT YOU TO CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG FOR EXAMPLE IF THEY WERE TO CHOOSE IF THEY WERE TO PUT FORWARD SAY A PROPERTY TAX MEASURE. THAT WERE INCLUDE PROPERTY TAXES IF THEY WERE TO CHOOSE THAT IT WOULD NOT BE INCLUDED ON ANY EITHER NEW. HOME CONSTRUCTION OR- SIGNIFICANT. ADDITIONS TO YOU I'M JUST. THE CARD EXACTLY THE TYPE OF THING WHEN WE LOOK AT THE OTHER WAYS THAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO BOTH FACILITATE GREEN LIGHT AND STREAMLINE HOUSING BY EITHER TRYING TO CAPPER LIMIT FEES OR GIVE SOME TAX EXEMPTIONS AND SUCH AS FAR AS I CAN TELL THIS BILL DOES NOT TIED THE HANDS OF THE BACK ROOM AND TO SEE IN TERMS OF PUTTING IN. THE KIND OF EXEMPTION THAT WILL BE A MIGHT BE ADVOCATING FOR CORRECT YOU ARE ENTIRELY CORRECT OKAY SO GIVEN THAT IN AYE I APPRECIATE THEIR RAISING THE POINT. BECAUSE I THINK IT AT LEAST I IS A BAY AREA MEMBER ESPECIALLY ONE WHERE I KNOW WE HAVE CALIFORNIA HAS THE HIGHEST COST TO CONSTRUCTION RIGHT NOW ANYWHERE BUT THE BERRY HAS EVEN HIGHER COST OF CONSTRUCTION AND THE REST TO CALIFORNIA. SO CLEARLY WE DON'T WANT TO ADD ANYTHING TO. TWO MAKING IT WORSE AND WE ALREADY ARE SEEING NOW ON WOULD YOU CALL IT PROJECTS THAT ARE THAT HAVE PERMITS ARE FULLY ENTITLED ENORMOUS NOT STARTING CONSTRUCTION BECAUSE AGAIN THEY'RE FINANCING IS IT'S JUST NOT MAKING SENSE RIGHT. SO ANYWAY SO MY POINT BEING THAT. THE BILL STILL ALLOWS FOR WHAT WAS ADVOCATED WITHOUT OUR HAVING TO AMEND OR FIX IT. NOW SECONDARILY. I AM GLAD THAT IT DOES NOT. MY I'M TIRED FROM THE LONG DAY LC DICTATE I DON'T USUALLY WOULDN'T USUALLY USE THAT TERM BUT IT DOESN'T DICTATE WHAT TYPES OF REVENUE MEASURES THE IT'S IT PUTS AROUND YEAR ROUND YOU CAN HERE ARE WHAT YOU HAVE OPTION FOR BUT IT DOESN'T DICTATE YOU MUST DO THIS WHEN YOU MUST DO THAT ONE. AND I'M VERY GLAD ABOUT THAT BECAUSE- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT A LOT OF SALES TAX. AND WE'VE GOT EVERY COMMUNITY IN COUNTY IN OUR DISTRICT TALKING ABOUT EXTRA. EXTRA SALES TAXES FOR EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN WE HAVE OUR SAME AREA WARNING SALES TAX FOR REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION MEASURES AND WE- AND A CERTAIN POINT AND- I PROBABLY ALREADY. WE ARE BEYOND WHAT WE CAN HANDLE SALES TAX SO I'M VERY GLAD IT DOESN'T DICTATE IT BECAUSE THERE ARE CERTAIN. TAXES THAT. I WOULD NOT BE SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT. I AM VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BILL AND OF CREATING THIS. AUTHORITY AND ABILITY TO PURSUE IT BUT I WILL BE WATCHING VERY CAREFULLY WHAT IS EXACTLY STRUCTURED BECAUSE I THINK THAT GIVEN THE INCOME. DISCREPANCIES IN OUR AREA AND THE COST OF HOUSING IN OUR AREA THAT WHATEVER IS DESIGNED REALLY NEEDS TO BE AS LESS REGRESSIVE AS POSSIBLE. BUT ANYWAY I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL AND SPECIALLY YOU SEVEN NUMBER TWO FOR. BEING PERSISTENT HONEST WORKING SO HARD ON IT AND I WANT TO THANK THE- ALL OF THE ENTITIES IN THE BAY AREA STARTING WITH CASA AND THEN CONTINUING ON TOO MANY MORE. WHO HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW CREATED TO CONDITION THE EVEN ALLOW THIS TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE IT IS TODAY. AND WITHOUT IT WILL BE SUPPORTING IT. THANK YOU AND I JUST. I FIRST OF ALL OBVIOUSLY IT WOULD ROOM YOU KNOW I DO OF. IF WE IF WE THE ISSUE A BAN. RAISED A FEW WEEKS AGO NOT. A DISPUTING THAT BURKE REGARDLESS OF THE TIMING. AND I. AND I AGREE WITH THOSE CENTER MCGUIRE AND CENTER SKINNER. THAT HAVING FLEX THE DISS FLEXIBILITY FOR WHAT THE- REGION WILL DECIDE TO DO. AND OF COURSE IF THERE IS ACTIVE. OPPOSITION TO ANY YOU KNOW REVENUE MEASURE. THAT'S ALWAYS PROBLEMATIC AND SO CLEARLY THERE WILL BE LOVERS AND HAVING THOSE DISCUSSIONS LOCALLY. BUT I DO I DON'T WANT IT TO GET LOST BY THE LATE OPPOSITION. THE CONCERN THAT WE HAVE. YOU KNOW IN IN OURS. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE AROUND HOUSING. IS THAT. WE DON'T TAX LONG TERM. PROPERTY OWNERS THE OTHER PASS. DRAMATICALLY REDUCE PROPERTY TAXES AND WHAT WE END UP TAXING IS. ODD BOTH OUR NEW RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION DOCKETS HEAVILY TAXED VIA AND IMPACT FEES AND THE NEW HOMEOWNERS BECAUSE THEY GOT TAX THE MARKET RATE UNDER PROP THIRTEEN. SO WE HAVE THIS SYSTEM WHERE WE YOU KNOW SAY NEW HOMEOWNERS THE TAX LAW AND HOMES THAT DON'T EVEN HAVE PEOPLE LIVING IN THEM YET. THE TAX LAW. AND SO IT IS IT IS A REAL ISSUE AND SO AGAIN THANK THE AUTHOR FOR GREEN TO CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION. AND. WITH THAT ARE THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS JUST CENTER MICHAEL SKI. THE BEARER PERSON ALL MOVED TO THE MEASURE BUT I WANTED TO DRIVE OUR ATTENTION BACK TO PAGE THIRTEEN BECAUSE. FOUR SIX FOUR SIX FOUR SIX HUNDRED. HE SEE SAYS IT'S THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT THE FUNDING AS THE CHAIR POINTS OUT SHE COME FROM COMMERCIAL DEVELOPERS BUSINESSES OF CERTAIN SIZE TAXPAYERS AND PROPERTY OWNERS ACROSS THE REGION SO AGAIN IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT THE MEASURE ELOQUENTLY GIVES THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES SAY BANK AND AN MTC THE AUTHORITY THAT THE TO PUT ON A MEASURE HOWEVER THEY STRUCTURE THAT WHICH IS WE LIKE TO HAVE THAT LOCAL CONTROL IN IT DOESN'T BALI BUT IT AND- IT LAYS OUT THE INTENT WHICH DOESN'T INCLUDE WHAT THIS LETTER SAYS ARE LOOPHOLES IT DOESN'T INCLUDE ANY THAT THERE'S A SINGLE. TAX NEW CONSTRUCTION IT. SPECIFICALLY DOESN'T CALL THAT OUT SO. I KNOW THIS IS A LATE HOUR I DON'T WHEN I READ THE OPPOSITION LETTER AND I READ THAT PLAIN TEXT AND I KNOW THAT THE PROCESS IS FOR. THE REGIONAL AGENCIES TO PUT THIS ON. AM I MISSING HERE ASSEMBLYMEMBER THESE DO YOU SEE ANYWHERE IN HERE THIS SPECIFICALLY CALLS OUT FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION TO FOOT THE BILL HERE FOR THE EAST FOR A HOUSING DEVELOPMENT I DON'T AND THAT'S WHY I AM STILL FRANKLY AS I'VE EXPRESSED TO SEE A STILL A LITTLE MYSTIFIED AS TO EXACTLY WHAT THE OBJECTION IS BECAUSE WE ARE NOT SAYING IN THIS BILL THEY'LL SHELL TAX RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPERS. WERE ST WE MAY TAX BUSINESSES OVER CERTAIN SIZE TAXPAYERS PROPERTY OWNERS EXCEPT TRUCK BUT WERE NOT SPECIFICALLY TAXING THAT ENTITY BUT THEIR CONCERN IS IF THEY'RE NOT SPECIFICALLY CARVED OUT FOR MORE GENERAL TAX THAT THEY WOULD BE BEARING ATTACKS THAT IS GONNA BE APPLIED GENERALLY. I THINK IT'S A CONVERSATION WE CAN HAVE AN AGAIN AS I SAID I REMEMBER ONE HAVE IT IF WE BELIEVE AS THE CHAIRMAN HAS INDICATED THAT THEY'RE ALREADY OVERTAXED WITH THOSE ARGUMENTS BE COMPELLING IN FRONT OF HIM TO SEE IN A BAG WHEN THEY WERE CONSIDERING A REGIONAL TAP I THINK IT VERY WELL COULD AND AS THE GOOD CENTER FOR BERKELEY POINTED OUT THIS IS ABSOLUTELY DISCUSSION THAT CAN HAPPEN BETWEEN A BAG AND THE FTC WHEN THEY CONSIDER. WHAT THEY WANTED TO AGAIN WE'RE WE'RE NOT BE PRESCRIPTIVE WERE PROVIDING A NUMBER OF OPTIONS AND ALSO JUST BE ABUNDANTLY CLEAR AS CENTER SKINNER SAID ALLUDED TO WE SPECIFICALLY TOOK OUT THE SALES TAX IS ONE OF THE OPTIONS BECAUSE WE HEARD FROM ALL OF COUNTIES THAT THAT IS NOT AN OPTION THEY WANT TO PROVIDE. TO THE NIGHT COUNTY REGION SO MOVING TRAIL. OKAY WITH MOTION THAT. QUESTIONS ABOUT YES AND REBATES. YEAH HI I'M- LOOKING AT PAGE THIRTEEN AND. SO I WOULDN'T THINK THAT BE I A IS NOT FAR OFF YOU OF THIS PARTICULAR STATEMENT IN THE INTENT SAYS PROPERTY OWNERS WITHIN THE REGION. THOSE COULD BE PROPERTY OWNERS WHO HAVE ENTITLEMENTS RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT AND THEREFORE THEY WOULD BE SUBJECT BILL LEFT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THEY'RE GONNA SPECIFICALLY BE CARVED OUT. AND THAT'S A LOT OF. THAT'S A LOT OF FAITH TO PUT IN AN ODD TO WHAT GOES ON AT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS EXCUSE ME AND I'VE THOUGHT ON THEM FOR YEARS AND YEARS. SO I THINK THEY HAVE A LEGITIMATE CONCERN OVER THAT THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED GOING FORWARD SECONDLY. I THINK THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE HARSH TO BE JUMPING ALL OVER THEM WHEN IN THEIR OWN LETTER. ARE THEY THEY SAY THAT IN JULY THEY RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT. WHAT WAS BEING BROUGHT FORWARD SO I'M NOT I AM JUST SAYING I THINK TONIGHT YOU GUYS BEEN A LOT OF TIME A LOT OF COMPROMISE CONVERSATIONS. BUT I THINK THAT THEY'RE JUST ASKING AND MAYBE IT IS A LITTLE TOO LATE I DON'T KNOW WHEN THE AMENDMENTS CAME. WERE PUT INTO THE BILL AND WHEN THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THEM. BUT I THINK THEY RAISE SERIOUS CONCERNS HOW THIS CAN BE. MANAGED WHEN HE GETS OUT TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND HOW IT'S ADDRESSED BY THE PARTNERS TO DOUBT. TO THOSE. AREAS LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENTITIES AND I'VE THIRD. PROBABLY TOO LONG TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVELS THESE ARE THINGS THAT WHEN YOU'VE GOT THAT KIND OF A LOOPHOLE YOU JUST KIND OF PUT YOUR FORTUNE ON THE TABLE IN FRONT OF A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT SHARE THE SAME. CONCERNS THAT YOU HAVE REGARDING PROPERTY RIGHTS THAT YOU CURRENTLY WERE GIVEN THREE YEAR ENTITLEMENT SO I JUST THROW THAT OUT FOR A DISCUSSION AND MAYBE GOING FOR WE DO TAKE A DEEPER LOOK AT THAT TO NOT I COULDN'T SUPPORT IT. VERY YOU KNOW BASED ON THAT ALONE. APPRECIATE THE PERSPECTIVE ALSO A FEW THINGS JUST SIMPLE PROCESS. I DO UNDERSTAND THERE WAS. THERE WAS RELEASED A CONVERSATION TO WITH MY STAFF. I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THERE WERE SOME MISUNDERSTANDINGS BETWEEN BOTH SIDES OF WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO GET OUT. IT WASN'T REYES WITH ME I AND- AND THE CHAIRMAN OF THIS COMMITTEE SOME REQUIRED I WE WERE ALL VERY DEEPLY GAUGE FOR MANY MANY MONTHS AND NO AND IT BROUGHT IT TO. TO OUR ATTENTION BUT PUT THE PUTTING THAT ASIDE. IN ALSO APPRECIATE YOUR POINT AROUND PROPERTY OWNERS AROUND THE REGION YES IT IS POSSIBLE. THAT CITY I MEMBERS COULD BE IN THAT SUBSET. I THINK THE POINT HERE IS IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A CAR ABOUT. OF ANY THESE GENERAL TAXES BECAUSE OF THIS LENGTHY PROCESS WE WENT THROUGH. THAT CARVING OUT ONE INDUSTRY IS LIKE PULLING OUT THE STRING. BECAUSE EVERY OTHER INDUSTRY SECTOR THAT DOESN'T WANT YOU TAX WILL BE ASKING FOR THE SAME THING AND SO THE IDEA WAS. WE THOUGHT WAS FAIRLY SAY GIVE THE REGION THE OPTION CONSUMER GENERAL TAX. IT'S UP TO THEM TO DECIDE WHO IT WOULD APPLY TO AND THAT IS THE INTENT. BUT THAT BEING SAID YOUR FIRST POINT WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE IN THIS COUNTRY SO I WOULD JUST ASK THAT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PROPERTY OWNERS WHO HAVE CURRENT ENTITLEMENTS FOR SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL. THAT HAS TO BE DISCUSSED OR YOU'VE GOT A HUGE LOOPHOLE HERE. SPECIFICALLY AND- YOU KNOW GENERALLY. THERE'S NO QUESTION BECAUSE GOVERNMENTS THAT CURRENTLY. HAVE ZONING ON THOSE PROPERTIES THAT WILL BE IN YOUR REGION. THEY CURRENTLY HAVE ENTITLEMENTS. THIS EITHER COMMERCIAL. FOR IS GOING TO BE RESIDENTIAL MY THE MULTI FAMILY. BUT IF THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT TAXING RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES. AND THEY BELIEVE THEY WERE NOT GOING TO BE INCLUDED. THAT WOULD SEEM TO ME YOU'D USE THE ENTITLEMENT APPROACH. HI BECAUSE YOU CAN. YOU KNOW AND THAT WAS ONLY CAN CHANGE. BUT SERIOUSLY THAT LEFT THAT'S A HUGE LOOPHOLE IN A BY. I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT THE LAST MAJOR DEVELOPMENT OF SOUTH. COUNTY IS CALLED THE RANCH. YET IT HAS ENTITLEMENTS FOR. HER SO I REMEMBER THIS RIGHT JOHN IS ABOUT FOURTEEN THOUSAND HOMES AND THERE'S MULTI FAMILY. THERE'S COMMERCIAL WITHIN THAT THAT IS ALL SET OUT IN A MAJOR GENERAL PLAN IF YOU WOULD EXPECT. WELL IF THAT YOU KNOW THINKING ABOUT BEING ABLE TO TAX THAT MANY SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL HOMES IN THAT HUGE DEVELOPMENT. BECAUSE SHE WANTED MORE AFFORDABLE OR WHATEVER TO FULL HUGE EMPOWER. INDIVIDUALS AND THEY NEED TO GO TO MARKET TO GET FINANCING WHATEVER. THEY'VE GOT HEALTH SOME PREDICTABILITY. AND I THINK THAT THAT. IS SOMETHING I'M JUST SAYING YOU KNOW TONIGHT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THE DECISION. ON. THIS BILL AND A LITTLE THE GOVERNOR BUT YOU GUYS NEED TO KEEP WORKING ON NOW. IT'S GOING TO BE I THINK VERY DIFFICULT WHEN IT GETS TO THE LEVEL OF A BACK. AND I'VE SAT ON YOU KNOW REGIONAL. PLANNING. ORGANIZATION LIKE THAT I'M JUST SUGGESTING THAT APPRECIATE WERE CERTAINLY BEAT IT TO DEATH CERTAINLY GONNA KEEP THE CONVERSATION GOING AGAIN IF WE IF WE TAKE OUT ONE SEGMENT OF PROPERTY OWNERS THE SEGMENT THAT'S LEFT IS GOING TO HAVE REAL ISSUE SO THAT'S HARD. AND THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY IS THIS WILL GET DISCUSSED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND IF FOR EXAMPLE OF THE CBA LOCAL COUNTERPARTS RACES ISSUE AND SAID THEY WOULD OPPOSE A REVENUE MEASURE. I HAVE A FEELING AND TO SEE NAY BACK WILL THINK EIGHT TIMES BEFORE MOVING FOR WITH THAT BECAUSE WE KNOW TO GET A TWO THIRDS VOTE IN A REGION LIKE THIS. REALLY DOES. REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT CONSENSUS AND THAT IS WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE PUSHING FOR. OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS COLLEAGUES. OKAY SEEING NINE SOME OF THE ROAD LIKE TO CLOSE LET ME JUST CLOSE BY RETIRING TWO THINGS FIRST DINNER DRINK SOME MAY. AND THEN SECONDLY I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR DEEP GAUGE MEANT EVERYONE ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS BUT IN PARTICULAR THE CHAIRMAN WHO SPENT MANY MANY HOURS WORKING WITH ME ON THIS.
