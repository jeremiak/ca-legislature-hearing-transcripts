THANK YOU WILL LEAVE THE RECORD OPEN FOR OUR ABSENCE MEMBER. ALL RIGHT LET'S BEGIN ITEM NUMBER ONE AB TWENTY ONE SEVENTY FOUR ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER. WELCOME TO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS- APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB TWENTY ONE SEVENTY FOUR WHICH WOULD AUTHORIZE YUBA AND SUTTER COUNTIES TO FORM A JOINT HOMELESS MULTI DISCIPLINARY PERSONNEL TEAM- THE TEAM WOULD FACILITATE INFORMATION SHARING- TO SUPPORT THE IDENTIFICATION ASSESSMENT AND LINKAGE OF HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS TO HOUSING AND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES ANDY TEAS ARE PROVEN TOOL THAT ALLOWED TEAMS FROM A VARIETY OF DISCIPLINES TO COORDINATE THEIR EFFORTS AND EIGHTY HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY USED FOR THE PAST THIRTY YEARS TO ADDRESS CHILD ABUSE OR NEGLECT. ALLOWING COUNTY SERVICE PROVIDERS TO WORK TOGETHER TO SHARE CASE INFORMATION MOST RECENTLY ANDY TIAS A MAN USED TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. UNFORTUNATELY CURRENT LAW LIMITS THE UTILIZATION OF HOMELESS NDTV'S TWO PROVIDERS WITHIN A SINGLE COUNTY. THIS CAN BE PROBLEMATIC FOR COUNTIES THAT WISH TO BETTER COORDINATE SERVICES ACROSS COUNTY LINES FOR THEIR HOMELESS POPULATIONS LIKE YUBA AND SUTTER COUNTIES YUBA AND SUTTER COUNTIES ARE ADJACENT TO EACH OTHER- THERE COUNTY SEATS YUBA CITY IN MARYSVILLE OR- BORDER ON THE FEATHER RIVER ACROSS FROM EACH OTHER- AND THEY HAVE MANY DIFFERENT PROGRAMS ARE ACTUALLY BY COUNTY THEIR MENTAL HEALTH IS B COUNTY- THERE- IN JUVENILE HALL AS BY COUNTY AND SO THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THEY ALREADY OPERATE TOGETHER. ON A BY COUNTY BASIS BECAUSE OF THEIR UNIQUE TO YOU GEOGRAPHY- THE HOMELESS POPULATION IN THIS AREA FREQUENTLY MOVES- ON BOTH SIDES OF THE RIVER- IN BETWEEN THESE TWO COMMUNITIES. YUBA AND SUTTER COUNTIES- AS I SAID OF CREATED BY COUNTY SERVICES PROGRAM FOR IT FOR GENERAL PLANNING. OF REGIONAL HOMELESSNESS EVER EFFORTS AND TO UNIFY PROPOSED INITIATIVES- PART OF THIS EFFORT INCLUDES EXPANDING AND UNIFYING THE COUNTY'S HOMELESS ENGAGEMENT AND RESOLUTION TEAMS. WHICH ARE CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW TO SEPARATE COUNTY TEAMS COORDINATION AND INFORMATION SHARING MAKES A LOT OF SENSE FOR THESE COUNTIES AS A ALREADY SHARE HOMELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE A BY COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT. AND HAVE CREATED A BY COUNTY HOMELESS CONSORTIUM. SO AB TWENTY ONE SEVENTY FIVE WOULD HELP THESE EFFORTS. TO PROVIDE HOUSING IN SUPPORT OF SERVICES TO HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS- WHICH ARE ESPECIALLY CRITICAL TO CONTAINING- COVERT NINETEEN. ARE HOMELESS POPULATION IS PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE DURING THIS CRISIS. SO INCREASE COORDINATION BETWEEN THE COUNTIES WOULD ALSO CREATE COST SAVINGS AND IMPROVE GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY EFFICIENCY BY PREVENTING DUPLICATIVE EFFORTS THE BETTER COORDINATION. AND SO THIS WOULD BE A VERY HELPFUL AND USEFUL TOOL FOR THESE COUNTY TO ALREADY WORKING TOGETHER IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS AND WITH ME TO TESTIFY ON THE PHONE ARE MARKS LET'S MEYER THE ADULT SERVICES BRANCH DIRECTOR FOR SUTTER COUNTY. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND CHI AGO EASY- THE YUBA COUNTY CAL WORKS HOMELESS PROJECT MANAGER. Q. AND I'D ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. GIFFORD FIRST WITNESS MISTER SCHULTZ MEYER. HI MARKS BUT FIRE- THEY DON'T SERVICES BRANCH DIRECTOR FOR START COUNTY HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR PROVIDING THIS TIME TO IN SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSED DAHLE I'D LIKE TO JUST PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE BACKGROUND ON THE BY COUNTY HOW MUCH EFFORT THAT'S CURRENTLY HAPPENING IN SOUTHERN YUBA COUNTY. ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND THE CA AS IF YOU'VE BEEN SUTTER COUNTY. CAME TOGETHER TO CREATE A BY COUNTY HOW MUCH PARTNERSHIP. THERE'S A LEADERSHIP GROUP HAS GATHERED ON A MONTHLY BASIS. TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS IN OUR REGION- IT CONSISTS OF BOARD OF SUPERVISOR REPRESENTATIVES FOR BOTH YUBA AND SUTTER COUNTY. AS WELL AS CITY COUNCIL REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE CITIES OF THE YUBA CITY MARYVILLE AND WE WENT. AS WELL AS THE CA OF THE BOTH SUTTER AND YUBA COUNTIES. SO THAT'SGOOD THIS COLLABORATIVE BY COUNTY GROUP HAS BEEN COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS AS A REGIONAL ISSUE. AND IS CONSTANTLY STRIVING TO CREATE A BALANCE OF STRONG SERVICES AND SUPPORT ON BOTH SIDES OF THE RIVER. THAT DIVIDES OUR TO COUNTY. ONE OF THE MAJOR TASKS AT THE BY COUNTY HOMES PARTNERSHIP IS TAKEN ON IS TO CREATE SUB COMMITTEES. TO ADDRESS- REGIONAL HOMELESSNESS AND AS A FAMILY MAN GALLAGHER POINTED OUT WE HAVE A- A SUBCOMMITTEE FOCUSED ON A HOMELESS OUTREACH- AND ENFORCEMENT TEAM CALLED HEART TEAM THAT- THE HOMELESS ENGAGEMENT RESOLUTION TEAM ACTUALLY- THIS CAME COMBINED SOCIAL SERVICES. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND ENFORCEMENT STAFF MEMBERS INTO ONE. REGIONAL WHAT THAT MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM. AND THE TEAM PROVIDE IT WILL THE TEAM IS GOING TO BE PROVIDING EXTENSIVE SUPPORT AND LINKAGE TO SERVICES IN AN EFFORT TO. PROVIDE WHAT WE CALL CAN COMPASSIONATE AND CODE ENFORCEMENT. SO BUT COUNTIES IN ALL FOUR OF THE MAJOR MUNICIPALITIES HAVE NOW APPROVED A SHARED AND- YOU. THAT WILL ALLOW THIS MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM. TO OPERATE IN ALL JURISDICTIONS. THE BILL FOR. A CRITICAL PIECE OF THE WORK THAT THIS TEAM WILL DO AS WITH OTHER MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM THE ABILITY TO SHARE. MINIMAL BASIC INFORMATION AMONG TEAM MEMBERS OF THE CENTRAL TO ACCOMPLISHING THE TEAM'S MISSION- AND AS YOU'RE AWARE HOMELESSNESS IS A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE TO ADDRESS AND COMMUNICATION AMONG THOSE TRYING TO SOLVE IT. IS A BASIC REQUIREMENT FOR SUCCESS. ARE TO CARRY TO PLACE THE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF EFFORT SO FAR INTO OUR COOPERATIVE APPROACH AND WITHOUT PASSAGE OF THIS BILL WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO ACCOMPLISH OUR MISSION OF ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS. IN OUR REGION SO I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. Q. KAYAK ELISE YEAH. AND I REMIND OUR WITNESSES THAT WE'RE LIMITED TO TWO MINUTES PER WITNESS. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M I'M PAYING AT LEAST YOU HAVE THE PROJECT MANAGER FOR HOMELESS AND HOUSING INITIATIVES AND YUBA COUNTY THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO BRING THE AUTHORIZATION OF A BY COUNTY HOMELESS MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM. THE TEAM THAT'S UNDER DEVELOPMENT IS IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO A LOCAL NEED THAT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED REGARDING COORDINATION OF CARE AND CONTINUATION OF SERVICES. ARE AREAS HAD RECOGNIZED CONTINUUM OF CARE IS THE SUTTER YUBA HOMELESS CONSORTIUM WHICH WAS FORMALIZED IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX. SINCE THAT TIME THE CONSORTIUM HAS SERVED BOTH YOU BY ANSWER COUNTIES WITH THE MISSION OF REDUCING DUPLICATION OF EFFORT AND INCREASING COMMUNICATION AMONG HOMELESS SERVICE AGENCIES. AB TWENTY ONE SEVENTY FOUR FALLS IN LINE WITH THE VISION OF OUR FIELD FEET THAT EVERYONE HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A SAFE PLACE TO CALL HOME. THE HOMELESS POPULATION AND EVENTS THAT ARE COUNTIES IS BLUE IT AND TRANSIENT AND DURING THE TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN BY COUNTY POINTED KIND COUNT 20% OF EACH COUNTY HOMELESSNESS AND CLAIM THEIR LAST RESIDENTS WITHIN THE NEIGHBORING JURISDICTION. WITH THE ONSET OF HOMELESSNESS AND ONE COUNTY AND THE MIGRATION ABOUT THEIR LIVING BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTIES EFFECTIVELY ADDRESSING AND BREAK THE BARRIERS TO HOUSING AND PROMOTING HEALTH AND WELL BEING IS DIFFICULT AT BEST FOR SOME OF UR REGION'S MOST VULNERABLE CITIZENS. I CREATING A JOINT HOMELESS MULTI DISCIPLINARY PERSONAL TEAM WE WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SEAMLESS CASE MANAGEMENT AND VACATION FOR THE END OF IT TOO OTHERWISE RIGHT IN THE CLUE AREA OF THE COUNTY'S. ONLY EVER INTERACT WITH ENFORCEMENT. WITH YOUR AUTHORIZATION AB ONE TWENTY FOR IDENTIFICATION MEANT AND SUPPORT OF BUT THAT WILL BE ANYWHERE. EVEN PLAYED AN INTERIM OR.

DID A DEAL THAT HAS SOME KIND OF GENERATIONS AND AMENDMENTS- JUST MAKING SURE THAT DOESN'T HURT SOME THE ALREADY EXISTING PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE- THE WORKING PROGRAMS LOS ANGELES COUNTY SO- I'LL BE INTERESTED TO HEAR YOUR RESPONSE THAT. JUST GALLAGHER SURE SO. I MYSELF- YOUR MANY ASPECTS HAVE BEEN VERY CONCERNED ABOUT PRIVACY- SO CERTAINLY THAT'S A CONCERN OF MINE AS WELL- I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANY PRIVACY CONCERNS- BY THE PRESENT BILL. IT MATCHES- WHAT LA COUNTY- LA COUNTIES PROGRAM HAS DONE- AND SO WE'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY THAN WHAT LA COUNTIES- PROGRAM. UNDER OUR PROPOSED. BILL THERE HAVE BEEN- ISN'T IN YOUR ANALYSIS PRIVACY COMMITTEE HAS RAISED SOME CONCERNS- YEAH BUT THE AMENDMENTS THAT THEY WANT WOULD ACTUALLY CHANGE MISTER SANTIAGO'S BILL. AND MY BILL ON THE ISSUE OF CONSENT- AND THAT WOULD BE PROBLEMATIC I MEAN I I'M NOT IN A PLACE WHERE I CAN ACCEPT AMENDMENTS IS GONNA CHANGE- A PROGRAM THAT'S ALREADY IN PLACE IN LA COUNTY AND LA COUNTY COULD PROBABLY SPEAK MORE TO THOSE CONCERNS I THINK THERE. ONE OF THE ENTITIES ITS ON THE CALL- SO MAYBE THEY COULD SPEAK MORE SPECIFICALLY TO THAT BUT- YOU KNOW I CAN'T ACCEPT AMENDMENTS THAT THEY'RE PROPOSING THAT WOULD CHANGE. WHAT THIS COMMITTEE AND LEGISLATORS ALREADY BETTER THAN APPROVED LAST LAST YEAR WITH MR SANTIAGO'S BILL. WE'RE JUST KEEPING IT THE SAME AS WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN IN PLACE. PREVIEW TO RESPONSE THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER STONE. THANK YOU WELL FOR CLARITY THAT THAT'S NOT ENTIRELY TRUE WHAT THIS DOES. IS THAT IT CREATES TWO DIFFERENT CLASSES SO THAT THERE IS AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT IF THERE IS SOMEONE WHO IS AT RISK OF BEING HOMELESS FOUR BEING SERVED BY THESE MULTIPLE THE MOTTO THIS FIRE TEAMS. BUT IF SOMEONE IS ALREADY HOME WAS THERE IS NO AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT SO IT'S GOOD THAT'S THE CHALLENGE HERE IS IT'S CREATING. A DICHOTOMY AND SO FOR SOMEONE WHO IS AS SUPPORTIVE OF PRIVACY RIGHTS AS I THOUGHT MISTER GALLAGHER HAD BEEN ON I'M SURPRISED AT THAT HE HASN'T TAKEN THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THAT DISCREPANCY. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. WE DO HAVE ONE ON THE PHONE LINES HOMICIDE SHERRY'S ARION PLEASE GO AHEAD.

I HAD BEEN TOLD THAT THEY MIGHT BE COMING ONLINE OKAY THERE IS REALLY THEIR CONCERN AS WELL THAT WE DON'T TAKE THAT ELEMENT BECAUSE IT WOULD SET A PRECEDENT AND CHANGE THEIR BILL IT WOULD ACTUALLY CHANGE THEIR PROGRAM.

IS NOT I MEAN THERE IS NO THERE IS NO HOMELESS ADVOCACY PROGRAM HAS RAISE THIS AS A CONCERN THERE HAS BEEN NO OPPOSITION STATED THIS IT IT KEEPS IT THE SAME AS LA COUNTIES PROGRAM THAT AGAIN HAS ALREADY BEEN APPROVED BY THIS LEGISLATURE- PREVIOUSLY SO I DON'T SEE THE CONCERN THAT IS BEING. THAT IS BEING REYES I JUST I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT AND AGAIN AT FIVE TAKE THAT AMENDMENT LA COUNTY WOULD BE OPPOSED TO THIS. TO THIS PROGRAM BECAUSE IT. WOULD CREATE. IT WOULD SET THAT IN IN PLACE FOR THEM AS WELL AND WE'RE JUST SAYING HEY WHAT'S BEEN ALLOWED HERE LET'S ALLOWED FOR YUBA AND SUTTER COUNTY AS WELL WHO ARE WORKING. IN THESE MD MD TEAS WHO WANT TO WORK IN THESE ENTITIES AS WELL. IT IS THE AS WAS NOTED AT THE BEGINNING.

ALONG WITH RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY ARE COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS BOARDING CARE STAY OFFER RESIDENTIAL LIVING FOR INDIVIDUALS NO LONGER ABLE TO LIVE INDEPENDENTLY. WHILE RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES SERVE SENIORS AYRES'S SERVE MANY OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS INCLUDING THOSE WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESSES OR OTHER CHRONIC CONDITIONS. IN RECENT YEARS THESE FACILITIES HAVE BEEN CLOSING AT AN ALARMING RATE. THIS TREND IS HIT AIR OF RESIDENTS PERIOD HARD SINCE THEY'RE CLOSE REQUIREMENTS ARE LESS PROTECTIVE THAN THOSE FOR RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES PUTTING RESIDENTS AT GREATER RISK FOR HOMELESSNESS. THIS BILL WOULD ADDRESS THE SITUATION BY EXPANDING THE ERROR OF CLOSURE REQUIREMENTS TO BE MORE SIMILAR TO THOSE FOR RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY. AND GIVING GOVERNMENT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TOOLS TO ENSURE THAT THESE FACILITIES STAY OPEN. AIR IF OPERATORS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE SIX MONTHS NOTICE TO RESIDENTS PRIOR TO CLOSURE. GIVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE A FACILITY WITHIN TWO MONTHS AT FAIR MARKET VALUE. PROVIDE A RELOCATION PLAN FOR ALL RESIDENTS SUBMIT A CLOSURE PLAN TO THE STATE. AND ALLOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FLEXIBILITY IN USING MENTAL HEALTH AND HOMELESS PREVENTION FUNDS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE. BEFORE COVER NINETEEN THIS BILL WAS IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS HER HOMELESSNESS CRISIS WITH THE PANDEMIC IT'S CRITICAL TO PROTECTING THE PUBLIC HEALTH OF BOTH AIR F.

IT IS PLACE CLIENTS FROM THESE RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES ARE OFTEN DEPENDENT ADULT YEARS WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE HISTORY THEY NEED A STRUCTURED SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENT. MANY HAVE SUFFERED FROM TRAUMATIC EVENTS AND ALSO HOW COMPLEX MEDICAL CONDITIONS HAVE EXPERIENCED HOMELESSNESS AND ARE AN ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR BASIC NEEDS LIKE FOOD AND SHELTER.

AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY SEVEN ESTABLISHES SOME IMPORTANT MANDATE THAT WILL MAKE LIFE BETTER WHO RESIDENTS TO BOARD HOMES. NOW WITH AN OPERATOR PLANS TO CLOSE THERE'S VERY LITTLE OF THIS REQUIREMENT BEYOND THAT GIVEN TO THE PART OF THE SOCIAL SERVICES. AN EXAMPLE HOW HOW THAT CAN WORK OUT WITH HOME BECAUSE IN BERKELEY A FEW YEARS AGO. RESIDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES HEARD RUMORS THAT THE STUDY WAS PLAN TO CLOSE. THE FINALLY CONFRONTED THE OPERATORS SAID THAT WAS THE CASE. IN THIS CASE THERE WAS NO REQUIREMENT- THAT THEY SHE FIND A DATA FILE THE POTENTIAL HOUSING OR MAKE ANY KIND OF RELOCATION PLAN TO SHE DIDN'T. WHAT THIS RESULTED IN WAS A MAN FOR THE- AND FAMILIES TRYING TO FIND OTHERHOUSING. FOR THEMSELVES. AT THAT POINT THERE WAS NO NOTICE REQUIREMENT THAT WOULD GIVE THIS CITY OF BERKLEY THE COUNTY LEVEL MEDIA. TIME TO DECIDE TO TRY TO PURCHASE THIS IS SO THEY- AND IN THIS CASE A PRIVATE PARTY SHOULD BUT- RELATIVELY QUICKLY. AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY SEVEN AND IT. ESTABLISHES IMPORTANT NOTICE REQUIREMENTS AS WELL HAVE BEEN REFERRED TO BEFORE. IN ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT I THINK IN ADDITION TO THE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS. IS THE MANDATE THE OPERATOR TO ASSIST RESIDENTS NEED TO THE DEMOCRATIC SUITABLE CREW SO THESE. WITHIN SIXTY MILES. SO THIS THESE ARE VERY IMPORTANT CHANGES THAT WILL BE VERY VERY HELPFUL TO PEOPLE.

AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY ONE WILL CREATE THE DEPARTMENT OF EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT ALIGNING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ENSURING FINALLY A STREAMLINED GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE FOR EARLY CHILD DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. WE ALL KNOW THAT THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OFLIFE FOR THE MOST IMPORTANT FOR A CHILD'S BRAIN DEVELOPMENT AND PROVIDING QUALITY EARLY EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS DURING THESE CRITICAL YEARS ENHANCES A CHILD'S OPPORTUNITY TO SUCCEED FURTHER IN COP IN SCHOOL COLLEGE AND ULTIMATELY THE WORK FORCE. OUR CURRENT SYSTEM IS GOVERNED UNDER A VARIETY OF STATE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES THIS BIFURCATED GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE OFTEN FORCES. PARENTS AND PROVIDERS SHOULD NEVER GET MULTIPLE CONTRACTS AND ENGAGE WITH MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS SOMETIMES EVEN SEEING A DISRUPTION IN SERVICES. A STRONG YOU SEE SYSTEM JUST LIKE ANY OTHER SEGMENT OF OUR EDUCATION CAN ONLY EXIST. WITH A STRONG GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE WHICH OPERATES TO GUARANTEE OUR EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS ARE CHEATING EDUCATIONAL GOALS AND PROMOTING EQUITY AS INTENDED. SINCE THE START OF THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC IT HAS BECOME INCREDIBLY CLEAR HOW IMPERATIVE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION PROGRAMS ARE FOR MANY OF CALIFORNIA'S FAMILIES INCLUDING OUR CENTRAL WORKERS. THE RELIANCE ON THESE PROGRAMS AND THE RECENT NEED AND SCRAMBLE TO STREAMLINE AN ORGANIZED ACROSS DEPARTMENTS TO PROVIDE EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS IN LIGHT OF THE PANDEMIC. ONLY FOR THEIR ILLUSTRATES THE NEED TO HAVE A CENTRALIZED GOVERNING STRUCTURE. MY OFFICE CONTINUES TO ENGAGE IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO ENSURE THAT AS THIS PROPOSAL DEVELOPS AND STAKEHOLDERS CONCERNS ARE MITIGATED IN FUTURE AMENDMENTS THIS DEPARTMENT TRULY SERVES THE CHILDREN. FAMILIES AND PROVIDERS AT ISN'T AS IT IS INTENDED TO. THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT HIGH QUALITY EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION CAN BE THE GREATEST EQUALIZER THE CALIFORNIA CAN PROVIDE FOR FAMILIES AND CHILDREN. AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT WILL ENSURE THAT WE PROVIDE THESE SOCIO ECONOMICALLY AND DEVELOPMENTALLY TRANSFORMATIVE PROGRAMS IN AN EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT MANNER. TO SPEAK ON THE MATTER OR SCOTT MORE DIRECTOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF COULD THEN GO AND PATRICIA LOZANO EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF EARLY EDGE CALIFORNIA AND I UNDERSTAND OUR SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC EDUCATION.

I'D REALLY CHILD HEALTH NUTRITION SERVICE I COULD GO ON HOWEVER. IF YOU'RE A PARENT OF A CHILD THAT NEEDS EARLY INTERVENTION DEVELOPMENTAL- OR SPEECH THERAPY- YOU MAY GO AND- GO TO THE REGIONAL CENTER- AND REQUEST- FOR YOUR CHILD TO BE OBSERVED- AND THEY MAY FIND THAT YOUR CHILD ACTUALLY DOES QUALIFY- FOR SPEECH THERAPY- HOWEVER- IF YOU ASK FOR SPEECH THERAPY- THAT IS IN CONJUNCTION WITH FULL THEY CHILD CARE- YOU MAY VERY WELL HERE THAT THAT NOT AVAILABLE- THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT. THE LAW CENTER DOES AND THAT BUT WHAT EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES IS ABOUT. THAT ULTIMATELY- MEANS THAT THAT FAMILY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SPEECH THERAPY- OR THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CHILD CARE SIR I DO NEED FOR THE REALITY IS.

AND THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE TO ASK YOU TO THINK ABOUT TODAY WHAT IS THE INTENDED GOAL FOR CHILDREN FOR EDUCATION FOR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. BECAUSE THIS BILL FAILS TO FAR IT FAR SHORT OF BRINGING ABOUT ANY SUCCESSFUL GOAL. THE BILL WILL CREATE GOVERNMENT PRIVATE COMMUNITY SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS P AND DOWN THE STATE FUNDED WITH TAX DOLLARS. THESE GROUPS WILL BE TASKED WITH DELIVERING MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELING THROUGH THE SCHOOL SYSTEM TO OUR CHILDREN. THOUGH THE PROMOTIONAL MATERIAL SPEAKS OF ALSO HELPING FAMILIES THERE'S LITTLE CAN NO MENTION OF FAMILIES IN THE BILL. WE BY THIS TIME IT GETS TO THE CHILDREN IT WILL BE SO WATERED DOWN MONEY DRAINED OUT OF IT THAT THERE WILL BE NO PROBLEMS GOAL AVAILABLE IT'S APPARENT THAT YOU HAVE COMPASSION FOR WHAT YOU SEE IS A LACK OF EQUITY AND THE CALIFORNIA LIFESTYLE. BUT THIS BILL WILL ONLY EXPAND THAT BLACK DRIVE WEDGES BETWEEN CHILD AND PARENT. OVER BURDEN OF SCHOOL SYSTEM BY TURNING IT AND GOING MENTAL HEALTH REPAIR SHOP. PLEASE DO THINK OF THE CHILDREN.
