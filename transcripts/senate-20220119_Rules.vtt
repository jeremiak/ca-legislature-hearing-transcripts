THAT WATER RELIABILITY AND

00:31:10.101 --> 00:31:11.970
COMMENT IS IT YOUR OPINION THAT

00:31:12.036 --> 00:31:13.905
WE WOULD NEED MORE ABOVE GROUND

00:31:13.972 --> 00:31:18.543

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:23.348
THERE IS- A LOT OF EMPHASIS PUT

00:31:23.414 --> 00:31:26.417
ON STORAGE AND ALTHOUGH I DO.

00:31:26.484 --> 00:31:28.353

CONSERVATION RECYCLING AND

00:31:33.891 --> 00:31:35.293
MAKING MORE INVESTMENTS WHEN IT

COMES TO WATER SUPPLY SO I DON'T

00:31:38.396 --> 00:31:40.465
THINK THAT STORAGE IS THE ONLY

00:31:40.531 --> 00:31:42.667
ANSWER I THINK THAT THERE'S GOT

00:31:42.734 --> 00:31:43.534
TO BE MORE WAYS- AGAIN

00:31:43.601 --> 00:31:45.603

DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES- OF

00:32:03.021 --> 00:32:05.156

CONVEYANCES STEM AND SO DOES THE

00:32:10.028 --> 00:32:11.629
CENTRAL VALLEY AND I CAN TELL

00:32:11.696 --> 00:32:13.298
YOU THAT WE START CONSTITUENTS

00:32:13.364 --> 00:32:14.899

00:32:14.966 --> 00:32:16.934
MYSELF MISS CAN BE- OPUS HER

00:32:17.001 --> 00:32:19.370
TADO- OUR CONSTITUENTS TURN

00:32:19.437 --> 00:32:20.605
THERE ARE SOME OF THEM THAT TURN

00:32:20.672 --> 00:32:23.007
ON THE FAUCET THERE'S NO WATER

00:32:23.074 --> 00:32:25.043
THAT COMES. AND DOES DOES THE

00:32:25.109 --> 00:32:27.645
COUNTY OR THE STATE- I THINK

00:32:27.712 --> 00:32:30.315
IT'S A CITY BUT THEY DELIVER-

00:32:30.381 --> 00:32:31.983
WATER TO THEIR HOUSES IN THESE

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:35.219
BIG BLACK- CONTAINERS EVERY WEEK

00:32:35.286 --> 00:32:36.754
SO THAT THERE'S SOME TYPE OF

00:32:36.821 --> 00:32:38.790
WATER SO. HOW DO YOU BALANCE THE

00:32:38.856 --> 00:32:40.024
NEEDS OF DISADVANTAGED

00:32:40.091 --> 00:32:42.360
COMMUNITIES- THAT RECEIVE THEIR

00:32:42.427 --> 00:32:44.329
DRINKING WATER FROM THE DELTA

00:32:44.395 --> 00:32:46.230
WITH THE INTEREST OF THE DELTA

00:32:46.297 --> 00:32:49.434
COMMUNITY. COLLEGE MEN'S AND R.

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:50.835
FOUR MILLION STRONG. GREAT

00:32:50.902 --> 00:32:53.071
QUESTION AND- AGAIN WITH ALL

00:32:53.137 --> 00:32:56.074
TRANSPARENCY IDEA. TO WORK WITH

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:58.443
COMMUNITIES- THAT DID HAVE TO

00:32:58.509 --> 00:33:01.979
GET. THEIR WATER. AND

00:33:02.046 --> 00:33:03.548
TRANSPORTED IN A BECAUSE HE

00:33:03.614 --> 00:33:04.782

YOU CAN AND BE ABLE TO DRINK OUT

00:33:10.254 --> 00:33:11.989
OF THE TAP- I THINK THAT IT'S-

00:33:12.056 --> 00:33:15.293
CRITICAL THAT WE WORK WITH OUR

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:17.362
LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND IS A MEMBER

00:33:17.428 --> 00:33:19.030
OF THE COUNCIL I'M SUPPOSED TO

00:33:19.097 --> 00:33:21.099
REPRESENT THE STATE AND NOT ONE

00:33:21.165 --> 00:33:26.070
REGION. YES AS I READ- WHAT THE

00:33:26.137 --> 00:33:27.238
LEGISLATURE INTENDED FOR US TO

00:33:27.305 --> 00:33:30.141
DO. I BELIEVE THAT THE DELTA%

00:33:30.208 --> 00:33:32.143
PROTECTION COMMISSION EXISTS TO

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:34.812
BE ABLE TO ELEVATE THOSE VOICES

00:33:34.879 --> 00:33:39.117
AND THOSE NEEDS- AND I DO

00:33:39.183 --> 00:33:40.785
BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO WORK.

00:33:40.852 --> 00:33:42.186
VERY STRATEGICALLY WITH OUR

00:33:42.253 --> 00:33:43.421
LOCAL REPRESENTATIVES AND IT

00:33:43.488 --> 00:33:46.224
THRILLS ME AND I'M SO GRATEFUL

00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:47.925
THAT WE HAVE OUR OWN. LOCAL

00:33:47.992 --> 00:33:49.260

BEING SUPERVISOR DONNA TOLD ME

00:33:53.064 --> 00:33:54.465
SO I THINK THAT IT'S THAT

00:33:54.532 --> 00:33:57.034
BALANCE THAT DELICATE BALANCE-

00:33:57.101 --> 00:34:00.471
BUT FOR ME I TAKE IT ONE STEP

00:34:00.538 --> 00:34:02.106

PRECIOUS DRINKING WATER- I WILL

00:34:10.915 --> 00:34:12.884
ALWAYS CONTINUE TO BE A VOICE

00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:15.019
AND MAKE CERTAIN. THAT

00:34:15.086 --> 00:34:17.321
COMMUNITIES CONTINUE TO HAVE THE

00:34:17.388 --> 00:34:20.024
RESOURCES OF THE BOYS AND THE

00:34:20.091 --> 00:34:23.461
ADVOCACY WHEN IT COMES TO CLEAN

00:34:23.528 --> 00:34:24.796
DRINKING WATER IN CALIFORNIA. I

00:34:24.862 --> 00:34:26.397

ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE

00:34:31.569 --> 00:34:34.005
RELIABLE CLEAN DRINKING WATER- I

00:34:34.071 --> 00:34:36.374
REALLY APPRECIATE IT BECAUSE

00:34:36.441 --> 00:34:37.608
IT'S BEEN YEARS SINCE SOME OF

00:34:37.675 --> 00:34:39.277
OUR CONSTITUENTS HAVE HAD THAT

00:34:39.343 --> 00:34:41.212
OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO TURN

00:34:41.279 --> 00:34:42.680
ON THEIR- FAUCET AND GET WATER

00:34:42.747 --> 00:34:44.449
AND SO I'M I'M LOOKING FORWARD

00:34:44.515 --> 00:34:47.051
TO WHAT YOU WILL DO. I'M IN THE

00:34:47.118 --> 00:34:47.518
BALANCE TO HELP THOSE

00:34:47.585 --> 00:34:52.990

VALLEY WHICH YOU GREW UP IN. AS

00:36:49.874 --> 00:36:51.208
THEIR SEVERAL COMMITTEES I THINK

00:36:51.275 --> 00:36:52.877
THERE'S OVER A HUNDRED AND

00:36:52.944 --> 00:36:53.511
SOMETHING COMMODITIES WHICH THE

00:36:53.578 --> 00:36:57.715
CENTRAL VALLEY GIRLS 99% OF. SO

00:36:57.782 --> 00:36:58.849
I MEAN IF YOU WERE GOING TO

00:36:58.916 --> 00:37:00.751
START BRING PISTACHIOS- CUTIES

00:37:00.818 --> 00:37:02.920
ARE ALL THOSE THINGS IN ANOTHER

00:37:02.987 --> 00:37:04.922
LOCATION AT THE UNITED STATES OR

00:37:04.989 --> 00:37:06.791
ANOTHER COUNTRY IT WOULD TAKE

00:37:06.857 --> 00:37:08.793
TIME FOR THOSE TREES MATURE TO

00:37:08.859 --> 00:37:11.462
PROVIDE THOSE PRODUCTS. OR THOSE

00:37:11.529 --> 00:37:13.698
COMMODITIES AND- IS THERE A

00:37:13.764 --> 00:37:15.666
BACKUP PLAN I'M REALLY

00:37:15.733 --> 00:37:17.335
INTERESTED TO KNOW IF THERE IS A

00:37:17.401 --> 00:37:18.769
BACK UP PLAN FROM THESE AGENCIES

00:37:18.836 --> 00:37:20.805
AND WHEN I SAY BACKUP PLAN I

00:37:20.871 --> 00:37:21.706
MEAN THAT. IN OUR FARMERS AND

00:37:21.772 --> 00:37:23.474
GROWERS THE CARD IS ZERO

00:37:23.541 --> 00:37:25.343
ALLOCATION FOR WATER LAST YEAR I

00:37:25.409 --> 00:37:27.612
DON'T ANTICIPATE IT BEING HIRED

00:37:27.678 --> 00:37:30.114
THIS YEAR. AND FROM THE STATE

00:37:30.181 --> 00:37:31.449
WATER PROJECT WHICH IS I KNOW

00:37:31.515 --> 00:37:33.751
THIS IS NOT THE DELTA- BUT YOU

00:37:33.818 --> 00:37:36.387

00:37:36.454 --> 00:37:38.522
BUT WE ARE LOOKING AT WATER

00:37:38.589 --> 00:37:40.257

00:38:35.112 --> 00:38:36.113
- YOU KNOW FOR CERTAIN COVERED

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:38.983
ACTIONS THAT LOCAL AGENCIES THAT

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:40.284
WOULD BENEFIT FROM A WATER

00:38:40.351 --> 00:38:43.154
PROJECT MUST. READ MUST

00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:44.922
DEMONSTRATE THEIR REDUCED

00:38:44.989 --> 00:38:46.724
RELIANCE ON THE DELTA AND TO DO

00:38:46.791 --> 00:38:49.026
SO THEY HAVE TO SHOW THEIR LOCAL

00:38:49.093 --> 00:38:50.394
URBAN AND ADD WATER MANAGEMENT

00:38:50.461 --> 00:38:52.763
PLANS. AND SO I DON'T BELIEVE

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:54.398
THAT THE LEGISLATURE REALLY

00:38:54.465 --> 00:38:56.600
SHOWED US HOW WE'RE SUPPOSED TO

00:38:56.667 --> 00:38:59.603
SHOW THE REDUCED RELIANCE- BUT I

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:01.372
DO BELIEVE THAT THE DEPARTMENT

00:39:01.439 --> 00:39:03.340
OF WATER RESOURCES. HAS THE

00:39:03.407 --> 00:39:08.012
GUIDANCE AND IS WORKING WITH US-

00:39:08.079 --> 00:39:09.680
IN IN TERMS OF HOW- THESE

00:39:09.747 --> 00:39:11.148
PROJECTS ARE GOING TO BE

00:39:11.215 --> 00:39:13.184
COMPLYING WITH THE REDUCED

00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:15.052
RELIANCE AND- REPORTING

00:39:15.119 --> 00:39:19.056
MECHANISMS. I DO OBVIOUSLY YOU.

00:39:19.123 --> 00:39:21.125
EMPATHETICALLY UNDERSTAND THAT

00:39:21.192 --> 00:39:23.060
AND AGAIN HAVING BEEN RAISED IN

00:39:23.127 --> 00:39:26.430
AGONY- MY PARENTS WORKED IN AG I

00:39:26.497 --> 00:39:28.666
AM A CHAMPION IF YOU WILL FOR

00:39:28.733 --> 00:39:32.236
ADD- AND RECOGNIZING THAT. WE

00:39:32.303 --> 00:39:35.039
NEED TO DO MORE- AND WE HAVE TO

00:39:35.106 --> 00:39:37.942
DO MORE TO PROVIDE AND THAT

00:39:38.008 --> 00:39:39.810
WATER TESTS WITH OUR FRESH FRESH

00:39:39.877 --> 00:39:41.712
FRUITS AND VEGETABLES- BUT I

00:39:41.779 --> 00:39:44.381
ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S

00:39:44.448 --> 00:39:46.817
GONNA BE SOME. MEDIATION BANDEL

00:39:46.884 --> 00:39:50.421
WORK- SOME GUIDANCE FOR HOW WE

00:39:50.488 --> 00:39:52.757
CAN ALL COME AT THIS TOGETHER

00:39:52.823 --> 00:39:55.025
AND I DO BELIEVE THAT REDUCING

00:39:55.092 --> 00:39:57.128
EVERYBODY'S RELIANCE- AND

00:39:57.194 --> 00:39:59.530
FINDING OTHER WAYS. OF YOU KNOW

00:39:59.597 --> 00:40:01.265
SO THAT EVERYBODY HAS ITS FAIR

00:40:01.332 --> 00:40:03.501
SHARE BUT WE CAN'T COMPROMISE IN

00:40:03.567 --> 00:40:06.504
MY OPINION WE CAN'T COMPROMISE-

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:10.174
MUCH OF WHAT. LEADS US ON A

00:40:10.241 --> 00:40:12.143
DAILY BASIS. AGAIN I APPRECIATE

00:40:12.209 --> 00:40:14.845
YOUR COMMENTS I YES I DO I JUST

00:40:14.912 --> 00:40:18.149
I THINK THAT PEOPLE FOCUS A LOT

00:40:18.215 --> 00:40:19.083
WHICH IS THERE IS A PORTION OF

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:21.018
THIS YOU KNOW. JOBS FARMWORKERS

00:40:21.085 --> 00:40:23.287
JOBS YOU KNOW OUR FARMS THAT

00:40:23.354 --> 00:40:25.756
HAVE BEEN THERE FOREVER AND BUT

00:40:25.823 --> 00:40:27.558
I THINK WE'RE COMING TO A POINT

00:40:27.625 --> 00:40:29.593
WITH THE WATER RESTRICTIONS AND-

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:31.428
YOU KNOW THAN NOT BEING ABLE TO

00:40:31.495 --> 00:40:33.130
PUMP GROUNDWATER. AND SOME OTHER

00:40:33.197 --> 00:40:35.332
STUFF FOR HOW FARMER SURVIVED I

00:40:35.399 --> 00:40:38.602
KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE FOR

00:40:38.669 --> 00:40:39.570
HALLOWEEN- HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

00:40:39.637 --> 00:40:41.472
OF ACRES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY-

00:40:41.539 --> 00:40:44.041
THIS YEAR ALONE AND SO. I AM

00:40:44.108 --> 00:40:45.609
VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE FUTURE

00:40:45.676 --> 00:40:49.013
AND FOOD SECURITY ISSUES AND-

00:40:49.079 --> 00:40:50.281
YOU KNOW WE'RE GETTING THIS FROM

00:40:50.347 --> 00:40:52.449
VISA I KNOW WE CAN GET THEM FROM

00:40:52.516 --> 00:40:53.751
OUR SOUTHERN NEIGHBOR THAT

00:40:53.818 --> 00:40:55.452
MEXICO I KNOW WE CAN GET FOOD

00:40:55.519 --> 00:40:57.788
THAT WE GROW IN THE CENTRAL

00:40:57.855 --> 00:40:59.456
VALLEY FROM VENEZUELA. BUT I

00:40:59.523 --> 00:41:00.958
HAVE A HUGE CONCERN ABOUT FOOD

00:41:01.025 --> 00:41:02.526
SECURITY ISSUES AND THE CENTRAL

00:41:02.593 --> 00:41:04.295
VALLEY WITHOUT WATER. I

00:41:04.361 --> 00:41:06.063
UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WANT TO ADD

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:07.665
THAT THERE IS SUPPOSED TO BE

00:41:07.731 --> 00:41:08.766
PLANS PUT TOGETHER SO THAT

00:41:08.833 --> 00:41:10.367
PEOPLE DON'T RELY ON THE ON THE

00:41:10.434 --> 00:41:12.903
DELTA FOR WATER RESOURCES. AT

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:14.338
BUT IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THE

00:41:14.405 --> 00:41:15.840
CENTRAL VALLEY IS BEING REDUCED

00:41:15.906 --> 00:41:17.041
FROM WATER FROM ALL SITES

00:41:17.107 --> 00:41:19.143
WHETHER IT'S GROUND WATER THAT

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:20.110
DELTA THE CONVENIENCE SUSPEND

00:41:20.177 --> 00:41:21.412
SURFACE WATER WHICH THEY HAD A

00:41:21.478 --> 00:41:22.947
CONTRACT TO AGREE WITH I MEAN.

00:41:23.013 --> 00:41:24.949
IT JUST SEEMS THAT I THINK THAT

00:41:25.015 --> 00:41:27.084
WE'RE NOT LOOKING LONG TERM AND

00:41:27.151 --> 00:41:30.287
F. AND- HERE THAT MAYBE BECAUSE

00:41:30.354 --> 00:41:31.555
WHEN I'M NOT GONNA SAY I DON'T

00:41:31.622 --> 00:41:34.225
KNOW IF IT'S BECAUSE OF TERM

00:41:34.291 --> 00:41:35.559
LIMITS AND YOU KNOW IN. YOU KNOW

00:41:35.626 --> 00:41:36.560
TWENTY YEARS ALL OF US WILL NOT

00:41:36.627 --> 00:41:38.729
BE HERE BUT I BELIEVE THAT YOU

00:41:38.796 --> 00:41:39.964
KNOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOME

00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:41.498
SERIOUS ISSUES FOR FOOD SECURITY

00:41:41.565 --> 00:41:44.835
IF WE DON'T FIX THIS SITUATION

00:41:44.902 --> 00:41:46.003
SPECIFICALLY. IN THE CENTRAL

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:50.808

SENATOR GROW BECAUSE I THINK

00:42:53.337 --> 00:42:55.572
THAT I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THE

00:42:55.639 --> 00:42:57.174
ISSUE BALANCE. OF THE LAW THAT

00:42:57.241 --> 00:43:01.211
CREATED THE STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL.

00:43:01.278 --> 00:43:02.813
IN TRYING TO BOUNCE IN THE WALL

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:05.449
IT SAID THERE WILL BE DOOR GOALS

00:43:05.516 --> 00:43:08.319
OF WATER RELIABILITY. AND

00:43:08.385 --> 00:43:11.322
HABITAT PROTECTION. IN IT AS I

00:43:11.388 --> 00:43:12.589
USED TO SAY IN A PRIOR

00:43:12.656 --> 00:43:13.691
INCARNATION AND EVERYBODY'S

00:43:13.757 --> 00:43:15.526
FIRMLY COMMITTED TO ONE OF THE

00:43:15.592 --> 00:43:18.028
TWO GIRLS. AND I THINK IT WAS

00:43:18.095 --> 00:43:19.163
DESIGNED TO BRING PEOPLE

00:43:19.229 --> 00:43:20.998
TOGETHER AND SO IF YOU WERE

00:43:21.065 --> 00:43:23.367

OF YOU AND THE COVERED ACTIONS

00:43:25.169 --> 00:43:28.305
WHICH IS YOUR STEP TOWARD QUORUM

00:43:28.372 --> 00:43:29.473
. HOW ARE YOU GONNA REFER THE

00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:31.608
BALANCE THAT'S REQUIRED BY THE

00:43:31.675 --> 00:43:33.444
LAW. TO MAKE SURE THAT HABITAT

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:34.645
PROTECTION IS ADEQUATELY

00:43:34.712 --> 00:43:36.747
PROTECTED AND WATER RELIABILITY

00:43:36.814 --> 00:43:38.882
IS ADEQUATELYPROTECTED HOW CAN

00:43:38.949 --> 00:43:41.585
I MAKE SURE DOESN'T TIP ONE WAY

00:43:41.652 --> 00:43:43.520
ORANOTHER AND WHAT YOU DO.

00:43:43.587 --> 00:43:45.456
THANK YOU SO MUCH- SENATOR LARRY

SPEAK WITH YOU EARLIER TODAY.

00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:53.063
WELL I REALLY TRULY FEEL THAT

00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:54.932
THE DELTA STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL-

00:43:54.999 --> 00:43:57.368
IS IN A- GREAT POSITION AND

00:43:57.434 --> 00:43:59.269
PROBABLY THE ONLY POSITION TO BE

00:43:59.336 --> 00:44:02.473
ABLE TO PUSH HARD- AGAIN ON IT

00:44:02.539 --> 00:44:06.210
THE REDUCING THE RELIANCE- AS A

00:44:06.276 --> 00:44:07.745
STATUTORY POLICY IN THE STATE OF

00:44:07.811 --> 00:44:10.447
CALIFORNIA I THINK THAT- AND WE

00:44:10.514 --> 00:44:11.615
SHARED AND DISCUSSED A LITTLE

00:44:11.682 --> 00:44:14.351
BIT IN OUR CALL EARLIER TODAY.

00:44:14.418 --> 00:44:16.420
IN THAT WE ARE NOT A SCIENTIST

00:44:16.487 --> 00:44:18.689
BUT WE ARE ALSO INDEPENDENT

00:44:18.756 --> 00:44:20.824
BOARD ITSELF I ALWAYS WANT TO

00:44:20.891 --> 00:44:22.526
LOOK AT IT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE

00:44:22.593 --> 00:44:25.062
OF WHAT MAKES SENSE AND CLEARLY

00:44:25.129 --> 00:44:28.399
WE HAVE SOME. AREAS OF CONCERN

00:44:28.465 --> 00:44:29.733
THAT WE NEED TO PROTECT THE

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:33.103
ECOSYSTEM- THAT THAT WE KEEP

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:35.639
TALKING ABOUT BUT IT'S ALSO

00:44:35.706 --> 00:44:38.642
ENSURING THAT WE AREN'T DOING.

00:44:38.709 --> 00:44:40.611
THE VERY BEST THAT WE CAN YOU

00:44:40.677 --> 00:44:43.213
KNOW REDUCING THE RELIANCE. S

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:45.883
I'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS AND

00:44:45.949 --> 00:44:46.350
CONTINUE TO HAVE MORE

00:44:46.417 --> 00:44:47.484
CONVERSATIONS AND LOOK FORWARD

00:44:47.551 --> 00:44:49.553
TO HAVING FURTHER CONVERSATIONS

00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:52.556
WITH YOU AS WELL. IT'S THE DELTA

00:44:52.623 --> 00:44:54.525
STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL IS A LONG

00:44:54.591 --> 00:44:56.794
TERM PLANNING AGENCY AND AS I

00:44:56.860 --> 00:45:00.364
LEARN MORE. I DO SEE THAT WE

00:45:00.431 --> 00:45:02.933
HAVE SOME. SOME DIFFICULT

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.301
DECISIONS THAT WE'RE GOING TO

00:45:04.368 --> 00:45:06.603
HAVE TO BE MAKING- IN THE VERY

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:08.705
NEAR FUTURE AND I DO TAKE A LOOK

00:45:08.772 --> 00:45:11.275
AT DELTA DOUBTS IS PART OF WHAT

00:45:11.341 --> 00:45:12.476
YOU'RE SAYING RIGHT NOW IN. WE

00:45:12.543 --> 00:45:14.311
HAVE DONE A BOULDER ABILITY

00:45:14.378 --> 00:45:15.212
ASSESSMENT IT'S ALREADY BEEN

00:45:15.279 --> 00:45:18.382
DONE AND SO PART OF THAT USED TO

00:45:18.449 --> 00:45:19.917
INCLUDE AGAIN THE SOCIAL BOTH

00:45:19.983 --> 00:45:21.685
VOTER ABILITIES THAT EXIST. AND

00:45:21.752 --> 00:45:24.521
LOOKING AT. ME AT THOSE

00:45:24.588 --> 00:45:26.590
COMMUNITIES THAT WE IDENTIFIED-

00:45:26.657 --> 00:45:28.692
TO FIND AGAIN THE MOST PRACTICAL

00:45:28.759 --> 00:45:29.860
AND EFFECTIVE AND THAT

00:45:29.927 --> 00:45:31.295
ADAPTATION STRATEGIES AND I

00:45:31.361 --> 00:45:32.663
THINK THAT'S KIND OF WHERE

00:45:32.729 --> 00:45:35.699
WE'RE- I'M GOING WITH YOUR- WITH

00:45:35.766 --> 00:45:37.968
YOUR COMMENTS- I THINK THAT

00:45:38.035 --> 00:45:39.436
THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A LOT THAT I'M

00:45:39.503 --> 00:45:40.704
GOING TO BE LEARNING AND I'M

00:45:40.771 --> 00:45:42.206
LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING THESE.

00:45:42.272 --> 00:45:45.642
CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU AND- SOME

00:45:45.709 --> 00:45:46.877
OF THE OTHER SENATORS THAT HAVE

00:45:46.944 --> 00:45:48.345
ALWAYS ALREADY ASKED FOR ME TO

00:45:48.412 --> 00:45:49.379
YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY HAVE SOME

00:45:49.446 --> 00:45:53.250
FURTHER CONVERSATIONS. I DO SEE

00:45:53.317 --> 00:45:53.917
. THAT THE DELTA STEWARDSHIP

00:45:53.984 --> 00:45:55.285
COUNCIL WAS CREATED FOR A

00:45:55.352 --> 00:45:58.555
PURPOSE- BACK PURPOSE CONTINUES

00:45:58.622 --> 00:45:59.923
TO INVOLVED BECAUSE THE SCIENCE

00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:01.792
IS NOT STAGNANT AND AS I LEARNED

00:46:01.859 --> 00:46:05.429
MORE- AND AS WE- ARE APPROACH ON

00:46:05.496 --> 00:46:07.131
A MONTHLY BASIS WITH REPORTS

00:46:07.197 --> 00:46:10.134
FROM. INDEPENDENT SCIENCE BOARD.

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:12.669
THE BILL SCIENCE SCIENTIST IF

00:46:12.736 --> 00:46:14.404
YOU WILL TO SHARE WITH LEYVA

00:46:14.471 --> 00:46:17.040
PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF. ARE GIVING

00:46:17.107 --> 00:46:20.344
US AGAIN THE APPROACHES- AND THE

00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:22.379
THOUGHT OF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO

00:46:22.446 --> 00:46:24.982
NEED TO BE PREPARED FOR IN THE

00:46:25.048 --> 00:46:28.352
VERY NEAR FUTURE. THEN I WON'T

00:46:28.418 --> 00:46:30.187
EXCUSE ME I WILL ENJOY HAVING

00:46:30.254 --> 00:46:32.256
THOSE TALKS WITH YOU I'D I DO

00:46:32.322 --> 00:46:33.924
HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE ON THE ISSUE

00:46:33.991 --> 00:46:36.026
AND HE SORT OF WALKED INTO MY

00:46:36.093 --> 00:46:37.494
OTHER QUESTION BECAUSE YOU SAID

00:46:37.561 --> 00:46:40.297
THAT. THE DISTRICT COUNCIL WAS

00:46:40.364 --> 00:46:42.966
CREATED FOR A PURPOSE YOU ALSO

00:46:43.033 --> 00:46:46.103
SAID IT WAS A LONG TERM PLANNING

00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:47.871
AGENCY. IT WAS ACTUALLY CREATED

00:46:47.938 --> 00:46:51.542
TO REVIEW THE DELTA PLAN. AND I

00:46:51.608 --> 00:46:52.676
DON'T THINK IT WAS DESIGNED TO

00:46:52.743 --> 00:46:55.012
BE A LONG TERM AGENCY. ONCE IT

00:46:55.078 --> 00:46:57.347
COMPLETED ITS OBLIGATION TO

00:46:57.414 --> 00:47:00.150
REVIEW THE PLANS. AND WHAT SEEMS

00:47:00.217 --> 00:47:01.618
TO BE HAPPENING IS THE THING

00:47:01.685 --> 00:47:02.286
THAT HAPPENS WITH SOME

00:47:02.352 --> 00:47:04.955
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES IF THEY FIND

00:47:05.022 --> 00:47:07.357
A WAY TO PERPETUATE THEMSELVES.

00:47:07.424 --> 00:47:09.860
AND TO KEEP GROWING AND SO. ARM

00:47:09.927 --> 00:47:12.129
I JUST GATHERED IN OUR TALK THIS

00:47:12.196 --> 00:47:13.797
MORNING IT IT TOTALLY AGREE WITH

00:47:13.864 --> 00:47:16.800
ME. BUT OUR I THOUGHT MAYBE IT

00:47:16.867 --> 00:47:18.402
TALK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE IT I

00:47:18.468 --> 00:47:19.970
THANK THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD

00:47:20.037 --> 00:47:22.873
REVISIT THIS IF IT. IF IT MEETS

00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:25.209
ITS ORIGINAL STATUTORY DIRECTION

00:47:25.275 --> 00:47:27.811
FOR ITS PURPOSE- WOULD YOU

00:47:27.878 --> 00:47:31.582
COMMENT ON THAT. YES SO AND THAT

00:47:31.648 --> 00:47:34.952
WAS MY UNDERSTANDING- AFTER WE

00:47:35.018 --> 00:47:36.320
CHATTED EARLIER TODAY AND THAT

00:47:36.386 --> 00:47:37.854
THE DELTA STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL

00:47:37.921 --> 00:47:43.093
WAS IN FACT. A PART OF THE- PART

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:44.061
OF THE I GUESS PLAN WITH

00:47:44.127 --> 00:47:46.830
EXPERIENCE PROJECT BUT MY AND

00:47:46.897 --> 00:47:48.599

00:47:48.665 --> 00:47:51.001
EDUCATE ME AND INFORMED ME-

00:47:51.068 --> 00:47:53.370

00:47:53.437 --> 00:47:55.339
THAN JUST THE CONVEYANCE PROJECT

00:47:55.405 --> 00:47:57.441
BUT IT WAS TO ALSO PROVIDE

00:47:57.507 --> 00:47:59.643
REGULATORY AUTHORITY. FOR ALL

00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:01.578
OTHER PROJECTS THAT ARE GOING TO

EARLIER TODAY- THE OTHER PART

00:48:09.519 --> 00:48:11.788
THAT POPPED INTO MY MIND IS WHO

00:48:11.855 --> 00:48:14.958
ELSE WOULD TAKE THE ROLE OF THE

00:48:15.025 --> 00:48:16.260
DELTA STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL IF WE

00:48:16.326 --> 00:48:18.362
PRETTY MUCH COMPLETE. BECAUSE I

00:48:18.428 --> 00:48:19.863
SEE THAT THE DELTA STEWARDSHIP

00:48:19.930 --> 00:48:21.598
COUNCIL IS REALLY THE ONLY

00:48:21.665 --> 00:48:24.101
AGENCY AT LEAST AS QUIET AS I

00:48:24.167 --> 00:48:25.369
SEE IT YOU MAY DISAGREE AND I

00:48:25.435 --> 00:48:27.638
AND AGAIN I WOULD WELCOME THIS

00:48:27.704 --> 00:48:29.373
CONVERSATION WITH YOU. OF WHO

00:48:29.439 --> 00:48:32.342
HAS THE VISION AND THE

00:48:32.409 --> 00:48:35.078
RESPONSIBILITY IN ENSURING THAT

00:48:35.145 --> 00:48:36.580
WE DO HAVE THAT BALANCE OF THE

00:48:36.647 --> 00:48:37.681
CALL WE WILL BUILD FOR BOTH THE

00:48:37.748 --> 00:48:39.349
EAGLE RESTORATION AND THE

00:48:39.416 --> 00:48:42.119
RELIANCE ON WATER. SO YOU'RE

00:48:42.185 --> 00:48:44.087
CORRECT I MAY BE MISINFORMED BUT

00:48:44.154 --> 00:48:46.957
I WELCOME THAT CONVERSATION

00:48:47.024 --> 00:48:48.592
FURTHER CONVERSATION WITH YOU.

00:48:48.659 --> 00:48:50.294
MALHAR WAS CHANNELING SENATOR

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:51.662
GROWTH BECAUSE USUALLY I COUNT

00:48:51.728 --> 00:48:55.032
ON OR- TO SAY THAT AN AGENCY

00:48:55.098 --> 00:48:56.800
MIGHT HAVE OUTLIVED ITS PURPOSE

00:48:56.867 --> 00:48:58.535
AND WE NEED TO REVISIT IT AND SO

00:48:58.602 --> 00:49:00.437
I JUST THOUGHT I WOULD DO IT ON

00:49:00.504 --> 00:49:02.472

THERE'S A WHLE HOST OF AGENCIES

00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:19.189
AND- I THINK THIS HAD A PURPOSE

00:49:19.256 --> 00:49:21.925
AND WHEN IT REALIZES ITS PURPOSE

00:49:21.992 --> 00:49:23.293
I THINK IT'S TIME TO HAVE A

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:25.595
