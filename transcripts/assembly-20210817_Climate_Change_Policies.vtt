PROGRESS- AND OBVIOUSLY. THE

00:31:05.563 --> 00:31:06.764
PROGRESS WAS LIMITED BUT THAT

00:31:06.831 --> 00:31:07.865
IT WAS REALLY LIMITED BY THE

00:31:07.932 --> 00:31:09.367
TECHNOLOGY WE REALLY WEREN'T

00:31:09.434 --> 00:31:11.836

THE TECHNOLOGY IS CLEARLY THERE

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:18.409
TO ACCOMPLISH OUR GOALS. AND SO

00:31:18.476 --> 00:31:21.546
WITH THAT IT REALLY IS A POLICY.

00:31:21.613 --> 00:31:23.248
QUESTION CALIFORNIA NEEDS

00:31:46.871 --> 00:31:47.939

CALIFORNIA'S ALWAYS BEEN A

00:31:56.481 --> 00:31:58.049
GLOBAL LEADER IN CLIMATE POLICY.

00:31:58.116 --> 00:32:00.251

00:33:17.161 --> 00:33:19.263
CRISIS THAT WE ARE FACING RIGHT

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:21.366
NOW AND THE SCIENCE. THE

00:33:21.432 --> 00:33:23.000
CLARITY OF THE SCIENCE THAT THE

00:33:23.067 --> 00:33:24.902
I. P. P. C. REPORT JUST

00:33:24.969 --> 00:33:28.740
REVEALED. AND SO WHAT I AM ALSO

00:33:28.806 --> 00:33:31.142
INTERESTED IN CLEARLY I WANT US

00:33:31.209 --> 00:33:33.911
TO CONTINUE TO SEND VERY STRONG

00:33:33.978 --> 00:33:36.948
MARKET SIGNALS BUT I ONE OF US

00:33:37.014 --> 00:33:37.949
TO ALSO MAKE SURE THAT WE LOOK

00:33:38.015 --> 00:33:41.919
AT. THOSE WAYS THAT WE CAN

00:33:41.986 --> 00:33:43.755
CAPTURE CARBON AND BY THAT I

00:33:43.821 --> 00:33:46.257
DON'T MEAN ONLY THAT CAPTURING

00:33:46.324 --> 00:33:48.192
CARBON SAY AT A FOSSIL FUEL

00:33:48.259 --> 00:33:50.528
FACILITY BUT RATHER. IN ALL OF

00:33:50.595 --> 00:33:53.531
THE NATURAL SYSTEMS BECAUSE

00:33:53.598 --> 00:33:55.967
THERE IS THE I. P. P. REPORT

00:33:56.033 --> 00:33:57.835
ALSO REVEALS THAT THERE IS

00:33:57.902 --> 00:34:00.671
GREAT CAPACITY WITHIN OUR

00:34:00.738 --> 00:34:02.273
NATURAL SYSTEMS SOILS.

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:05.176
GRASSLANDS OTHERS TO DO THAT

00:34:05.243 --> 00:34:06.778
FOR US IN ADDITION TO VARIOUS

00:34:06.844 --> 00:34:09.313
TECHNOLOGIES AND TECHNOLOGICAL

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:12.316
WAYS TO DO IT AND I- IT'S

00:34:12.383 --> 00:34:14.018
UNDERSTANDABLE THAT WE MAY NOT

00:34:14.085 --> 00:34:15.319
HAVE FOCUSED ON THAT BECAUSE

00:34:15.386 --> 00:34:17.855
OUR- FOCUS TO DATE LEGITIMATELY

00:34:17.922 --> 00:34:18.823
HAS BEEN AN EMISSIONS

00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:20.691
REDUCTION. BUT I THINK WE ALSO

00:34:20.758 --> 00:34:23.895
NEED TO GREATLY- FOCUS IN THAT

00:34:23.961 --> 00:34:25.730
AREA AND I'M CURIOUS TO HEAR

00:34:25.797 --> 00:34:30.268
FROM. OUR PANELISTS- THOUGHTS

00:34:30.334 --> 00:34:32.136
ON THAT SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU

00:34:32.203 --> 00:34:34.872
VERY MUCH CENTER SKINNER.

00:34:34.939 --> 00:34:38.342
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. I WASN'T

00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:40.311
PLANNING ON SPEAKING- BUT OUT

00:34:40.378 --> 00:34:40.878
OF THE HABIT IS TO SAY A FEW

00:34:40.945 --> 00:34:44.081
WORDS. I DO THINK IT IN WITH MY

00:34:44.148 --> 00:34:45.850
COLLEAGUES HERE- I THINK I'M

00:34:45.917 --> 00:34:48.786
THE ONE I NINE- A PARTISAN ON

00:34:48.853 --> 00:34:50.788
THIS- ON THIS DAY IN THIS

00:34:50.855 --> 00:34:52.523
COMMITTEE. BUT IT'S ALSO

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:53.491
CLIMATE CHANGE HAS BEEN ONE OF

00:34:53.558 --> 00:34:55.193
THOSE THINGS THAT- AFTER

00:34:55.259 --> 00:34:56.494
LOOKING AND STUDYING THE

00:34:56.561 --> 00:34:57.495
SCIENCES SOMETHING I'VE I'VE

00:34:57.562 --> 00:34:59.597
TAKEN UP- AND UNDERSTANDING

00:34:59.664 --> 00:35:02.133
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS- THAT

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:04.168
IS NOT JUST A REAL IT'S AND

00:35:04.235 --> 00:35:04.735
IT'S WITH THOSE PURSING IT

00:35:04.802 --> 00:35:06.604
EVERY SINGLE DAY. I THINK THE

00:35:06.671 --> 00:35:08.439
ONE FRUSTRATION FOR ME IS WHEN

00:35:08.506 --> 00:35:09.707
WE LOOK AT CALIFORNIA

00:35:09.774 --> 00:35:11.976
CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A LEADER.

00:35:12.043 --> 00:35:12.810
IN THIS SPACE ARE CERTAINLY NO

00:35:12.877 --> 00:35:14.245
DOUBT ABOUT THAT GLOBALLY WE'VE

00:35:14.312 --> 00:35:15.847
BEEN WE'VE BEEN A LEADER. I

00:35:15.913 --> 00:35:16.747
STILL DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE A

00:35:16.814 --> 00:35:18.683
VERY CLEAR ROADMAP ON WHAT IT

00:35:18.749 --> 00:35:21.152
IS THAT WE'RE GOING. TO DO WAS

00:35:21.219 --> 00:35:23.955
IT JUST. A REDUCING OUR CARBON

00:35:24.021 --> 00:35:25.523
EMISSIONS IS NOT ENOUGH WE HAVE

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:27.458
TO GET TO A POINT. TO NOT ONLY

00:35:27.525 --> 00:35:28.793
A CARBON NEUTRAL ABOR ALSO

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:30.795
CARBON NEGATIVE. THE QUESTION

00:35:30.862 --> 00:35:32.363
IS HOW DO WE GET THERE AND WHAT

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:33.264
DOES THAT LOOK LIKE WHAT'S THE

00:35:33.331 --> 00:35:35.366
ROAD MAP. FOR US TO FOLLOW AND

00:35:35.433 --> 00:35:37.368
THAT'S NOT CLEAR I EVEN STATE

00:35:37.435 --> 00:35:38.769
POLICY WE'VE DONE SOME AMAZING

00:35:38.836 --> 00:35:41.105
STATE POLICY. IN THIS SPACE BUT

00:35:41.172 --> 00:35:43.441
IT ISN'T VERY CLEAR VERY WELL

00:35:43.508 --> 00:35:45.510
THOUGHT OUT POLICY WE PICKED A

00:35:45.576 --> 00:35:47.311
LOT OF WINNERS AND LOSERS. AND

00:35:47.378 --> 00:35:49.013
YET BUT WE HAVEN'T DONE IS JUST

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:50.448
DECIDED HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA

00:35:50.515 --> 00:35:51.849
DO HERE IS THE ROADMAP FOR US

00:35:51.916 --> 00:35:52.383
TO BE ABLE TO GET YOU SO

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:53.818
HOPEFULLY. WITH THIS COMMITTING

00:35:53.885 --> 00:35:55.520
AS WE BEGIN TO WORK- WITHIN

00:35:55.586 --> 00:35:58.022
BOTH HOUSES. AND NOT JUST THIS

00:35:58.089 --> 00:35:58.723
LEGISLATIVE SESSION BUT NEXT

00:35:58.789 --> 00:36:01.559
LEGISLATIVE SESSION. WE CAN PUT

00:36:01.626 --> 00:36:03.027
THAT TOGETHER. ALL RIGHT THANK

00:36:03.094 --> 00:36:04.161

JUST AS AN ASIDE. I DO HAVE A

00:36:06.297 --> 00:36:07.532
PLAN FOR THAT BUT WE CAN TALK

00:36:07.598 --> 00:36:08.833
ABOUT THAT. AND THEN THE

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:10.568
LOCATION. I ALSO WANT TO

PRETTY FIRED UP ABOUT THIS

00:36:22.013 --> 00:36:22.947
ISSUE I'VE GOT ALL THE MORE SO

00:36:23.014 --> 00:36:24.949
BY READING THAT IPCC REPORT

SLIGHTEST PART OF MY

00:37:01.252 --> 00:37:03.688
PRESENTATION- THIS IS THE-

00:37:03.754 --> 00:37:05.456
FIRST OPPORTUNITY I HAVE PRIDE

WANTED TO START- WITH AIR

00:37:24.775 --> 00:37:28.579
QUALITY. THAT CALIFORNIA HAS

00:37:28.646 --> 00:37:30.681
HAD REMARKABLE SUCCESSES IN

00:37:30.748 --> 00:37:34.085
TERMS OF- DEALING WITH OUR AIR

00:37:34.151 --> 00:37:36.454
QUALITY RESPONSIBILITIES BPA

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:38.222
THAT HEALTH BASED STANDARDS AND

00:37:38.289 --> 00:37:40.191
IT'S REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW TO

00:37:40.257 --> 00:37:41.225
REGULARLY REVIEW THOSE

00:37:41.292 --> 00:37:42.693
STANDARDS TO ENSURE THAT THEIR

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:44.629
HEALTH PROTECTIVE BASED ON THE

00:37:44.695 --> 00:37:47.164
LATEST SCIENCE AND INPUT FROM

00:37:47.231 --> 00:37:49.967
CARD. NOT OXIDES OF NITROGEN

00:37:50.034 --> 00:37:51.736
ARE ONE OF THE KEY SMOG FORMING

00:37:51.802 --> 00:37:53.137
POLLUTANTS WE CONTROL TO

00:37:53.204 --> 00:37:56.741
PREVENT OZONE. FORMATION AND

00:37:56.807 --> 00:37:57.942
THE CHART ON THE SLIDE SHOWS

00:37:58.009 --> 00:37:59.377
CALIFORNIA'S PROGRESS IN

00:37:59.443 --> 00:38:03.114
REDUCING NOT COMMISSION SINCE

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:03.881
TWO THOUSAND. EMISSIONS HAVE

00:38:03.948 --> 00:38:05.216
BEEN STEADILY DECREASING SINCE

00:38:05.282 --> 00:38:06.717
THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES DUE TO

00:38:06.784 --> 00:38:08.653
MULTIPLE REGULATIONS OVER

00:38:08.719 --> 00:38:10.921
ADOPTED OVER TIME. AND THAT'S

00:38:10.988 --> 00:38:12.523
PROGRESS REALLY REFLECTS THE

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:14.525
BENEFITS OF CARBONI PA PROGRAMS

00:38:14.592 --> 00:38:16.527
FOR MOBILE BIRTH IS AN AIR

00:38:16.594 --> 00:38:17.728
DISTRICT PROGRAMS FOR

00:38:17.795 --> 00:38:20.297
STATIONARY. MOBILE SEARCHES ARE

00:38:20.364 --> 00:38:21.599
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LARGEST

00:38:21.666 --> 00:38:22.633
SHARE OF NOT EMISSIONS

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:24.502
REDUCTION DUE TO MORE STRINGENT

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:32.510
REFLECTS THESE BENEFITS.

00:38:32.576 --> 00:38:33.744
BECAUSE MOBILE SOURCES THEIR

00:38:33.811 --> 00:38:35.813
RESPONSIBLE 480% OF ****

WIENER FEELS AN INCENTIVE

00:38:41.085 --> 00:38:42.953
FINDINGS HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:44.955
FOR A LARGE PORTION OF THIS

00:38:45.022 --> 00:38:47.091
PROGRESS. FOR EXAMPLE EMISSIONS

00:38:47.158 --> 00:38:50.728
FROM A NEW CAR ARE 99% CLEANER

00:38:50.795 --> 00:38:52.496
THAN A CAR FROM THE EARLY

00:38:52.563 --> 00:38:53.964
NINETEEN SEVENTIES. AND AS YOU

00:38:54.031 --> 00:38:55.700
KNOW THE STANDARD SET HERE IN

00:38:55.766 --> 00:38:58.269
CALIFORNIA A COPY THROUGHOUT

00:38:58.335 --> 00:39:00.304
THE COUNTRY AND THE WORLD. THAT

00:39:00.371 --> 00:39:03.074
PEOPLE WELL BEYOND OUR BORDERS

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:05.876
BENEFIT FROM OUR LEADERSHIP.

00:39:05.943 --> 00:39:07.812
HARPER AND THE AIR DISTRICTS

00:39:07.878 --> 00:39:09.714
HAVE ALSO WORKED TO REDUCE RISK

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:11.582
OF EXPOSURE TO AIR TOXICS FROM

00:39:11.649 --> 00:39:13.517
INDUSTRIAL SOURCES LIKE

00:39:13.584 --> 00:39:15.619
REFINERY. SMALLER SOURCES LIKE

00:39:15.686 --> 00:39:18.622
GAS STATIONS AND MOBILE SOURCES

00:39:18.689 --> 00:39:20.024
LIKE DIESEL TRUCKS. CALIFORNIA

00:39:20.091 --> 00:39:22.927
THEIR TACTICS PROGRAM BEGAN IN

00:39:22.993 --> 00:39:23.527
NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE WITH THE

00:39:23.594 --> 00:39:24.295
ADOPTION OF THE TOXIC AIR

CONTAMINANT IDENTIFICATION AND

00:39:26.097 --> 00:39:28.099
CONTROL ACT. AND THE STATE HAS

00:39:28.165 --> 00:39:29.934
IDENTIFIED OVER TWO HUNDRED

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.569
SUBSTANCES THAT ARE HAZARDOUS

00:39:31.635 --> 00:39:33.270
TO HEALTH. AND HAVE ADOPTED

00:39:33.337 --> 00:39:35.272
NUMEROUS REGULATIONS TO REDUCE

00:39:35.339 --> 00:39:37.374
EMISSIONS AND EXPOSURE TO THESE

00:39:37.441 --> 00:39:39.376
POLLUTANTS INCLUDING LIMITING

00:39:39.443 --> 00:39:40.444
THE LEVELS OF BENZENE IN

00:39:40.511 --> 00:39:42.246
GASOLINE AND PHASING OUT THE

USE OF. CARCINOGENS FROM DRY

00:39:45.416 --> 00:39:47.451
CLEANERS BY TWENTY TWENTY

00:39:47.518 --> 00:39:48.085
THREE. THE STATE'S EFFORTS

00:39:48.152 --> 00:39:49.920
CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON REDUCING

00:39:49.987 --> 00:39:51.756
EMISSIONS OF DIESEL PARTICULATE

00:39:51.822 --> 00:39:54.091
WHICH ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT 70% OF

00:39:54.158 --> 00:39:56.660
THE TOTAL KNOWN CANCER RISK

00:39:56.727 --> 00:39:57.094
RELATED TO TOXIC AIR

00:39:57.161 --> 00:40:00.765
CONTAMINANT. THESE NUMBERS AND

00:40:00.831 --> 00:40:01.799
TRENDS ARE IMPRESSIVE. THE AIR

00:40:01.866 --> 00:40:05.069
IS CLEANER. THREE THIRTY

00:40:05.136 --> 00:40:06.337
THOUSAND PREMATURE DEATHS ARE

00:40:06.403 --> 00:40:08.506
AVOIDED EACH YEAR TWO HUNDRED

00:40:08.572 --> 00:40:10.407
AND FIFTY THOUSAND ASTHMA CASES

00:40:10.474 --> 00:40:12.376
HAVE BEEN AVOIDED. ALL THE

00:40:12.443 --> 00:40:13.878
WHILE CALIFORNIA HAS GROWN TO

00:40:13.944 --> 00:40:15.346
BE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN

00:40:15.412 --> 00:40:18.916
THE WORLD. BUT LET ME BE CLEAR

00:40:18.983 --> 00:40:19.517
THERE ISN'T MORE WORK AHEAD OF

00:40:19.583 --> 00:40:22.319
US. ACTION AT LEAST ONE THIRD

00:40:22.386 --> 00:40:24.054
OF CALIFORNIA'S THIRTY NINE

00:40:24.121 --> 00:40:25.656
POINT FIVE MILLION RESIDENTS

00:40:25.723 --> 00:40:26.991
STILL LIVE IN COMMUNITIES THAT

00:40:27.057 --> 00:40:28.425
EXCEED FEDERAL HEALTH

00:40:28.492 --> 00:40:31.195
PROTECTIVE STANDARD. EXPOSURE

00:40:31.262 --> 00:40:32.029
TO DIESEL PARTICULATE IS TOO

00:40:32.096 --> 00:40:34.131
HIGH ESPECIALLY IN COMMUNITIES

00:40:34.198 --> 00:40:36.033
NEAR FREIGHT FACILITIES AT THE

00:40:43.207 --> 00:40:44.275
GRAPHIC SHOWS SOME OF THE

00:40:44.341 --> 00:40:46.710
PROGRESS WE'VE MADE SINCE

00:40:46.777 --> 00:40:47.511
EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO WEST SIDE

00:40:47.578 --> 00:40:49.313
AND SINCE WE STARTED DISCUSSING

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:52.183
PLAN PROCESS. IN TWO THOUSAND

00:40:52.249 --> 00:40:52.883
WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT

00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:54.885
PROGRESS IN REDUCING EMISSIONS

00:40:54.952 --> 00:40:57.955
PER CAPITA THIRTY EIGHTY P. AND

00:40:58.022 --> 00:41:00.591
IN TOTAL WHILE THE ECONOMY AND

00:41:00.658 --> 00:41:02.459
POPULATION CONTINUE TO GROW.

00:41:02.526 --> 00:41:03.761
THE PIE CHART SHOWS WHICH

00:41:03.828 --> 00:41:05.362
SECTORS CONTRIBUTE THE MOST TO

00:41:05.429 --> 00:41:08.699
OUR GHG EMISSIONS IN THE AB

00:41:08.766 --> 00:41:10.968
THIRTY TWO GHG INVENTORY. SB

00:41:11.035 --> 00:41:13.304
THAT 24% IS INDUSTRIAL AND

00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:14.738
APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THAT

00:41:14.805 --> 00:41:16.574
INDUSTRIAL SECTOR IS RELATED TO

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:17.908
OIL AND GAS EXTRACTION AND

00:41:17.975 --> 00:41:19.977
REFINING. WHICH PUTS THE

00:41:20.044 --> 00:41:23.080
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR AT ABOUT

00:41:23.147 --> 00:41:25.482
50% OF THE STATE'S EMISSIONS.

00:41:25.549 --> 00:41:27.051
SO FOCUSING ON THE

00:41:27.117 --> 00:41:27.551
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IS

00:41:27.618 --> 00:41:30.721
CRITICAL. IN TWENTY NINETEEN

00:41:30.788 --> 00:41:33.691
CALIFORNIA'S GHG EMISSIONS WERE

00:41:33.757 --> 00:41:34.291
FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTEEN MILLION

00:41:34.358 --> 00:41:35.159
METRIC TONS OF CO TWO

00:41:35.226 --> 00:41:37.995
EQUIVALENT. TRANSPORTATION IS

00:41:38.062 --> 00:41:39.997
THE LARGEST ANTHROPOGENIC

00:41:40.064 --> 00:41:41.732
SOURCE OF CALIFORNIA GHG

00:41:41.799 --> 00:41:45.135
EMISSIONS. THE TRANSPORTATION

00:41:45.202 --> 00:41:46.937
SECTOR IS ALSO THE DOMINANT

00:41:47.004 --> 00:41:48.873
SOURCE OF NITROGEN OXIDES ARE

00:41:48.939 --> 00:41:50.774
NOT EMISSIONS THAT CONTRIBUTE

00:41:50.841 --> 00:41:52.543
TO OZONE AND OUR PARTICULAR AIR

00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:54.278
QUALITY PROBLEMS AS I MENTIONED

00:41:54.345 --> 00:41:57.214
EARLIER. DOMINATED BY THE HEAVY

00:41:57.281 --> 00:41:58.716
TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT

00:41:58.782 --> 00:42:00.918
INCLUDING HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS

00:42:00.985 --> 00:42:02.686
BUSES READY TO QUIT MEANT

00:42:02.753 --> 00:42:05.856
LOCOMOTIVES. MARINE VESSEL. AND

00:42:05.923 --> 00:42:07.558
OTHER OFF ROAD EQUIPMENT

00:42:07.625 --> 00:42:09.994
ACCOUNTING FOR OVER 60% OF THE

00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:11.795
STATE'S NOT COMMISSION. IN

00:42:11.862 --> 00:42:13.264
ADDITION DIESEL PARTICULATE

00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:15.432
MATTER MAKES UP 30% OF ALL

00:42:15.499 --> 00:42:17.101
PARTICULATE MATTER EMISSIONS

00:42:17.167 --> 00:42:19.703
FROM THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR.

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:20.804
UNLIKE THE OTHER PARTICULATE

00:42:20.871 --> 00:42:22.273
MATTER INCLUDED IN THE PIE

00:42:22.339 --> 00:42:23.908
GRAPHS DIESEL PM IS NOT A

00:42:23.974 --> 00:42:26.143
CRITERIA POLLUTANT BUT IT'S A

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:29.280
TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS. SO

00:42:29.346 --> 00:42:31.181
LET'S PIVOT TO THE AB THIRTY

00:42:31.248 --> 00:42:32.583
TWO STEPPING PLAN AND THE WORK

00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:34.985
THAT LIES AHEAD. THE THIRTY

00:42:35.052 --> 00:42:36.854
PLANT ARE ACTIONABLE PLANS TO

00:42:36.921 --> 00:42:38.555
LAY OUT COST EFFECTIVE AND

00:42:38.622 --> 00:42:40.291
TECHNOLOGY FEASIBLE

00:42:40.357 --> 00:42:42.359
TECHNOLOGICALLY FEASIBLE PATH

00:42:42.426 --> 00:42:44.128
TO ENSURE THAT WE MEET THESE

00:42:44.194 --> 00:42:45.963
GHG REDUCTION TARGET. EACH

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:47.531
CUTTING PLAN HAS INCLUDED A

00:42:47.598 --> 00:42:49.533
SUITE OF POLICIES AND HAVE

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:52.269
NEVER RELIED ON JUST ONE

00:42:52.336 --> 00:42:53.837
APPROACH TO REDUCING EMISSIONS.

00:42:53.904 --> 00:42:55.606
THEY EACH HAVE A COMBINATION OF

00:42:55.673 --> 00:42:58.342
INCENTIVES REGULATIONS AND

00:42:58.409 --> 00:43:00.210
CARBON PRICING MECHANISMS.

00:43:00.277 --> 00:43:02.079
IMPORTANTLY THE PLAN IS ECONOMY

00:43:02.146 --> 00:43:05.149
WIDE AND SPANS MANY YEARS I

00:43:05.215 --> 00:43:06.483
THOUGHT IT COULD NOT GO INTO

00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:08.652
THE DESIGN DETAILS OF ANY

00:43:08.719 --> 00:43:10.621
PARTICULAR PROGRAM A REGULATION

00:43:10.688 --> 00:43:13.357
NORDIC AT THE PLANT OR CREATE

00:43:13.424 --> 00:43:15.392
NEW STATUTES AND REGULATIONS.

00:43:15.459 --> 00:43:17.127
THE FIRST STEPPING PLAN WAS

00:43:17.194 --> 00:43:18.829
RELEASED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AND

00:43:18.896 --> 00:43:20.397
SUBSEQUENT UPDATES HAVE BEEN

00:43:20.464 --> 00:43:22.333
RELEASED AT LEAST ONCE EVERY

00:43:22.399 --> 00:43:24.468
FIVE YEARS. EVERY PREVIOUS

00:43:24.535 --> 00:43:25.836
SCOPING PLAN WAS DESIGNED TO

00:43:25.903 --> 00:43:29.239
PROVIDE GHG AND AIR POLLUTION

00:43:29.306 --> 00:43:30.541
EMISSIONS REDUCTION. WE ARE

00:43:30.607 --> 00:43:32.609
REQUIRED TO IN A- MINIMIZE

00:43:32.676 --> 00:43:34.712
LEAKAGE WHICH IS WHEN THE

00:43:34.778 --> 00:43:36.280
PRODUCTION OF GOODS AND JOBS

00:43:36.347 --> 00:43:38.615
LEAVES THE STATE. SO IT LOOKS

00:43:38.682 --> 00:43:40.651
LIKE WE REDUCED EMISSIONS BUT

00:43:40.718 --> 00:43:42.252
IN FACT THEY MERELY REMOVED

00:43:42.319 --> 00:43:44.154
WERE MOVED OUT OF OUR INVENTORY

00:43:44.221 --> 00:43:46.457
THAT WE NEED TO BE CAREFULLY

00:43:46.523 --> 00:43:49.259
ANALYZING LEAKAGE. FINALLY AB

00:43:49.326 --> 00:43:50.527
THIRTY TWO REQUIRES US TO

00:43:50.594 --> 00:43:51.962
FACILITATE SUBNATIONAL AND

00:43:52.029 --> 00:43:53.797
NATIONAL COLLABORATION. AND

00:43:53.864 --> 00:43:56.000
THAT POLICIES BECAUSE DEFECTIVE

00:43:56.066 --> 00:43:58.335
AND FLEXIBLE WITH COMPLIANCE.

00:43:58.402 --> 00:43:59.503
CLIMATE CHANGE IS A GLOBAL

00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:01.638
ISSUE AND WITHOUT ACTION FROM

00:44:01.705 --> 00:44:03.173
LIKE MINDED PARTNERS WE WILL

00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:05.009
STILL FACE THE IMPACTS OF

00:44:05.075 --> 00:44:06.577
CLIMATE CHANGE. OR GLOBAL

00:44:06.643 --> 00:44:08.512
POLLUTANTS SUCH AS GREENHOUSE

00:44:08.579 --> 00:44:11.482
GASES. A REDUCTION ANYWHERE IS

00:44:11.548 --> 00:44:13.784
A BENEFIT EVERYWHERE. OUR GOAL

00:44:13.851 --> 00:44:15.052
HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO DEVELOP

00:44:15.119 --> 00:44:16.653
SCALABLE AND EXPORTABLE

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:17.955
PROGRAMS THAT OTHER

00:44:18.022 --> 00:44:19.390
JURISDICTIONS CAN USE TO

00:44:19.456 --> 00:44:22.092
IMPLEMENT AND REDUCE EMISSIONS

00:44:22.159 --> 00:44:26.130
WITHIN THEIR BORDERS. THE

00:44:26.196 --> 00:44:26.997
TWENTY TWENTY TO THE SCRAPPING

00:44:27.064 --> 00:44:28.465
PLAN WILL AFFECT PROGRESS TO

00:44:28.532 --> 00:44:29.933
ACHIEVING OUR TWENTY THIRTY

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.301
TARGET AND IT WILL IT WILL

00:44:31.368 --> 00:44:33.137
EVALUATE HOW TO PUT OURSELVES

00:44:33.203 --> 00:44:35.339
ON A PATH THAT ULTIMATELY

00:44:35.406 --> 00:44:36.874
ACHIEVES CARBON NEUTRALITY.

00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:38.942
ONYX GRAPHICS YOU CAN SEE THE

00:44:39.009 --> 00:44:40.778
TWENTY THIRTY TARGET OF 40%

00:44:40.844 --> 00:44:42.646
BELOW NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS BY

00:44:42.713 --> 00:44:44.214
TWENTY THIRTY. IF WE ACHIEVE

00:44:44.281 --> 00:44:46.350
THAT TARGET AND MAINTAIN THAT

00:44:46.417 --> 00:44:47.851
RATE OF REDUCTION WE WOULD BE

00:44:47.918 --> 00:44:50.888
ABLE TO ACHIEVE 80% BELOW

00:44:50.954 --> 00:44:51.422
NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS BY

00:44:51.488 --> 00:44:53.991
TWENTY FORTY. THAT PUTS US IN A

00:44:54.058 --> 00:44:56.393
GOOD POSITION TO ACHIEVE CARBON

00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:58.495
NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY FORTY

00:44:58.562 --> 00:44:59.329
FIVE. TWENTY THIRTY IS A

00:44:59.396 --> 00:45:01.498
MILESTONE ON THE WAY TO

00:45:01.565 --> 00:45:02.766
ACHIEVING CARBON NEUTRALITY.

00:45:02.833 --> 00:45:05.269
THE LEVEL OF TRANCE FORMATION

00:45:05.335 --> 00:45:06.670
REQUIRED TO HIT CARBON

00:45:06.737 --> 00:45:08.772
NEUTRALITY BY MIDCENTURY MEANS

00:45:08.839 --> 00:45:10.174
THAT WE SHOULD PRIORITIZE

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:12.009
ACTIONS IN TECHNOLOGIES THAT

00:45:12.076 --> 00:45:13.243
WILL NOT RESULT IN STRANDED

00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:15.345
ASSETS AFTER TWENTY THIRTY. AND

00:45:15.412 --> 00:45:16.180
THAT WE NEED TO BE THINKING

00:45:16.246 --> 00:45:19.049
ABOUT LONGER POLICY SIGNAL. TO

00:45:19.116 --> 00:45:20.684
ATTRACT PRIVATE CAPITAL FOR

00:45:20.751 --> 00:45:23.320
ACTION AND INVESTMENT IN CLEAN

00:45:23.387 --> 00:45:26.290
TECHNOLOGY. I LAUGHED AT THE

00:45:26.356 --> 00:45:28.659
PLAN ADOPTED IN TWENTY

00:45:28.725 --> 00:45:29.359
SEVENTEEN LAID OUT A PATH TO

00:45:29.426 --> 00:45:30.627
ACHIEVE THE TWENTY THIRTY

00:45:30.694 --> 00:45:33.864
TARGET A 40% BELOW NINETEEN

00:45:33.931 --> 00:45:35.132
NINETY. BUT INCLUDE ACTION ON

00:45:35.199 --> 00:45:36.733
EVERY SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY AND

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:38.535
IDENTIFIED THE NEED FOR CLEAN

00:45:38.602 --> 00:45:40.404
ENERGY AND TECHNOLOGY.

00:45:40.471 --> 00:45:42.239
ALTERNATIVE MOBILITY OPTIONS.

00:45:42.306 --> 00:45:44.274
THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AND

00:45:44.341 --> 00:45:45.976
SLASHING SHORT LIVED CLIMATE

00:45:46.043 --> 00:45:47.945
POLLUTANT. IMPORTANTLY IT

00:45:48.011 --> 00:45:49.146
HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED TO

00:45:49.213 --> 00:45:50.047
LEVERAGE OUR EXISTING AIR

00:45:50.114 --> 00:45:52.282
QUALITY PROGRAMS TO ACHIEVE OUR

00:45:52.349 --> 00:45:54.718
GHG TARGETS AND CONTINUE TO

00:45:54.785 --> 00:45:55.986
DRIVE DOWN HARMFUL AIR

00:45:56.053 --> 00:45:57.354
POLLUTION IN VULNERABLE

00:45:57.421 --> 00:46:00.657
COMMUNITIES. IMPORTANTLY KEEP

MINISTRATIONS THE LEGISLATURE

00:46:29.553 --> 00:46:31.054
AND STATE AGENCIES HAVE BEEN

00:46:31.121 --> 00:46:32.689
WORKING DILIGENTLY TO SEND

00:46:32.756 --> 00:46:35.225
STEADY POLICY SIGNALS THAT WE

00:46:35.292 --> 00:46:38.162
WANT TO REDUCE GHGS AND ADDRESS

00:46:38.228 --> 00:46:39.696
CLIMATE CHANGE. WE ARE NOW IN

00:46:39.763 --> 00:46:41.131
THE SECOND DECADE OF TACKLING

00:46:41.198 --> 00:46:42.866
CLIMATE CHANGE AND WE ARE

00:46:42.933 --> 00:46:44.668
SEEING OUTCOMES THAT WE HAD

00:46:44.735 --> 00:46:46.670
HOPED FOR. WE KNOW CLIMATE

00:46:46.737 --> 00:46:47.905
ACTION COULD CREATE AND KEEP

00:46:47.971 --> 00:46:49.873
HIRING JOBS SUCH AS IN OUR

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:51.875
CLEAN TECH SECTORS. WE HAVE

00:46:51.942 --> 00:46:53.377
SEEN SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT AND

00:46:53.443 --> 00:46:56.847
INCREASED INVESTOR INTEREST IN

CLEAN ENERGY AND CLEAN

00:46:57.381 --> 00:46:59.283
TECHNOLOGY. FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE

00:46:59.349 --> 00:47:00.851
AT LEAST TWO REFINERIES

00:47:00.918 --> 00:47:02.386
DEVASTATED THEY WILL STOP

00:47:02.452 --> 00:47:04.054
PRODUCING CONVENTIONAL DIESEL

00:47:04.121 --> 00:47:05.622
AND INSTEAD PRODUCE RENEWABLE

00:47:05.689 --> 00:47:08.992
DIESEL. WHICH PRODUCES 30% LESS

00:47:09.059 --> 00:47:11.595
DIESEL PM. THEY CANCER CAUSING

00:47:11.662 --> 00:47:13.197

HEAVILY BURDENED COMMUNITIES

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.103
WHICH ARE OFTEN ADJACENT. SO I

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:21.238
WANT TO DIGRESS FOR A MOMENT

00:47:21.305 --> 00:47:23.173
AND TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANT

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:23.740
ROLE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN

00:47:23.807 --> 00:47:26.376
THIS WORK. MANY FACILITIES WE

00:47:26.443 --> 00:47:28.946
NEED TO MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS

00:47:29.012 --> 00:47:29.880
SUCH AS RENEWABLE ENERGY

00:47:29.947 --> 00:47:31.682

SITING REQUIREMENTS. IT'S

00:47:45.996 --> 00:47:47.397
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT LOCAL

00:47:47.464 --> 00:47:49.199
GOVERNMENTS TAKE THE URGENCY OF

00:47:49.266 --> 00:47:50.667
ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE INTO

00:47:50.734 --> 00:47:53.337
ACCOUNT AS THEY ARE REVIEWING

00:47:53.403 --> 00:47:54.504
THESE LAND USE ISSUES.

00:47:54.571 --> 00:47:56.106
ACHIEVING SUCCESS ON CLIMATE

00:47:56.173 --> 00:47:58.242
CHANGE MEANS THAT WE NEED TO

00:47:58.308 --> 00:48:00.143
REMOVE OBSTACLES FOR THE CLEAN

00:48:00.210 --> 00:48:01.612
TRANSITION OF EXISTING

00:48:01.678 --> 00:48:04.147
INFRASTRUCTURE. OR BUILD OUT OF

00:48:04.214 --> 00:48:05.983
NEW CLEAN ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE

00:48:06.049 --> 00:48:07.618
AND RECOGNIZE THE EXECUTION OF

00:48:07.684 --> 00:48:09.886
THE SCOPING PLAN. REALLY DOES

00:48:09.953 --> 00:48:12.789
RELY ON A STORY AT BOTH THE

00:48:12.856 --> 00:48:17.194
STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL. WE

00:48:17.261 --> 00:48:19.229
KICKED OFF THE TWENTY TWENTY TO

00:48:19.296 --> 00:48:21.198
SCOPING PLAN WITH A SERIES OF

00:48:21.265 --> 00:48:24.167
WORKSHOPS IN JUNE. AND THE PLAN

00:48:24.234 --> 00:48:26.536
WILL BE CONSIDERED BY THE BOARD

00:48:26.603 --> 00:48:29.106
IN LATE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. IT

00:48:29.172 --> 00:48:30.874
DOES DIFFER FROM THE TWENTY

00:48:30.941 --> 00:48:32.309
SEVENTEEN STEPPING PLAN IN

00:48:32.376 --> 00:48:34.811
CONTENT AND PURPOSE. ANY THIRTY

00:48:34.878 --> 00:48:37.114
TARGETED IN STATUTE AND WE MUST

00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:39.316
REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS BY AT

00:48:39.383 --> 00:48:42.152
LEAST 40% FROM NINETEEN NINETY

00:48:42.219 --> 00:48:45.055
LEVELS BY TWENTY THIRTY BY LAW.

00:48:45.122 --> 00:48:45.589
BUT WE WILL BE ASSESSING

00:48:45.656 --> 00:48:47.224
PROGRESS TOWARDS ACHIEVING THAT

00:48:47.291 --> 00:48:49.860
TARGET. WE ALSO RECOGNIZE AS I

00:48:49.926 --> 00:48:51.895
MENTIONED EARLIER THAT TWENTY

00:48:51.962 --> 00:48:53.297
THIRTY IS A MILE DOWN ON WHERE

00:48:53.363 --> 00:48:55.365
RECENT GIANT SAYS WE NEED TO BE

00:48:55.432 --> 00:48:57.334
BY MID CENTURY. SO WE CAN'T

00:48:57.401 --> 00:49:00.037
WAIT UNTIL TWENTY THIRTY ONE TO

00:49:00.103 --> 00:49:00.671
START PLANNING FOR TWENTY FORTY

00:49:00.737 --> 00:49:02.072
FIVE. BECAUSE THE LEVEL OF

00:49:02.139 --> 00:49:04.308
TRANSFORMATION NEEDED ACROSS

00:49:04.374 --> 00:49:06.977
THE ECONOMY IS UNPRECEDENTED SO

00:49:07.044 --> 00:49:07.577
WE NEED TO START PLANNING FOR

00:49:07.644 --> 00:49:09.680
THAT NOW. WHICH MEANS LOOKING

00:49:09.746 --> 00:49:10.947
FOR ACTION TO DEPLOY CLEAN

00:49:11.014 --> 00:49:13.717
ENERGY AND CLEAN TECH HIT THE

00:49:13.784 --> 00:49:14.584
TWENTY THIRTY TARGET AND PUT US

00:49:14.651 --> 00:49:16.753
ON THE PATH TO THE TWENTY FOUR

00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:18.822
FORTY FIVE TARGET. CAN'T THE

00:49:18.889 --> 00:49:25.062
COUPLE THE TWO. IT LOOKS OUT

00:49:25.128 --> 00:49:26.830
OVER TWENTY YEARS THIS COPING

00:49:26.897 --> 00:49:27.931
PLAN WILL HAVE THE LONGEST

00:49:27.998 --> 00:49:29.566
PLANNING HORIZON OF ANY

00:49:29.633 --> 00:49:32.235
PREVIOUS VERSION. BUT AS NOTED

00:49:32.302 --> 00:49:33.870
EARLIER WE ARE ALSO WE VALUE IT

00:49:33.937 --> 00:49:35.339
IN A PATH TO ACHIEVE CARBON

00:49:35.405 --> 00:49:38.141
NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY THIRTY

00:49:38.208 --> 00:49:38.642
FIVE HER DIRECTION FROM

00:49:38.709 --> 00:49:40.143
GOVERNOR NEWSOM. MEANS THAT WE

00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:41.778
WILL PLACE A LARGER FOCUS ON

00:49:41.845 --> 00:49:43.180
OUTCOMES WE NEED TO ACHIEVE BY

00:49:43.246 --> 00:49:45.582
THAT TIME. IN IDENTIFYING

00:49:45.649 --> 00:49:47.417
OUTCOME THE MODELING WILL

00:49:47.484 --> 00:49:49.686
PROVIDE PASSED FOR CLEAN

00:49:49.753 --> 00:49:50.153
TECHNOLOGY AND ENERGY

00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:52.222
DEPLOYMENT. FOR EXAMPLE THE

00:49:52.289 --> 00:49:53.457
RATE OF SALES OF LIGHT DUTY

00:49:53.523 --> 00:49:55.292
ELECTRIC VEHICLE OR ELECTRIC

00:49:55.359 --> 00:49:57.828
APPLIANCES. METRICS IN ADDITION

00:49:57.894 --> 00:50:00.831
TO THE ANNUAL GHG INVENTORY CAN

00:50:00.897 --> 00:50:01.431
HELP US TRACK PROGRESS MOVING

00:50:01.498 --> 00:50:04.000
FORWARD. IMPORTANTLY THESE

00:50:04.067 --> 00:50:05.335
OUTCOMES MUST BE CONSIDERED

00:50:05.402 --> 00:50:06.703
BOTH IN THE CONTEXT OF

00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:08.372
ACHIEVING NEAR TERM AIR QUALITY

00:50:08.438 --> 00:50:10.707
BENEFITS AND LONGER TERM

00:50:10.774 --> 00:50:13.677
GREENHOUSE GAS BENEFITS. THE

00:50:13.744 --> 00:50:15.712
COPING PLAN UPDATE WILL ALSO

00:50:15.779 --> 00:50:17.013
REQUIRE US TO REDEFINE OUR

00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:20.183
SCOPE OF SOURCES AND THINK IN

00:50:20.250 --> 00:50:20.684
THE FRAMEWORK OF CARBON

00:50:20.751 --> 00:50:22.919
NEUTRALITY. THAT PROTECTS

00:50:22.986 --> 00:50:24.554
CONFIDENTIALITY IS ACHIEVED

00:50:24.621 --> 00:50:28.058
REMISSION SOURCES EQUAL THANK.

00:50:28.125 --> 00:50:30.394
UP UNTIL NOW EVERY SCOPING PLAN

00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:31.461
AS MENTIONED EARLIER HAS

00:50:31.528 --> 00:50:33.063
FOCUSED ON REDUCING EMISSIONS

00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:36.333
FROM THE SOURCES DEFINED IN AB

00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:37.100
THIRTY TWO INVENTORY WHICH

00:50:37.167 --> 00:50:39.669
FOCUSES ON FOSSIL ENERGY AND

00:50:39.736 --> 00:50:41.371
INDUSTRIAL FORCES. AND WE DO

00:50:41.438 --> 00:50:43.206
HAVE A SEPARATE INVENTORY FOR

00:50:43.273 --> 00:50:45.242
NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS. BUT

00:50:45.308 --> 00:50:46.510
AS WE SHIFTED A FRAMEWORK OF

00:50:46.576 --> 00:50:47.811
CARBON NEUTRALITY WE WILL

00:50:47.878 --> 00:50:49.579
EXPAND THE SCOPE TO INCLUDE ALL

00:50:49.646 --> 00:50:50.947
SOURCES WHICH MEANS THE

00:50:51.014 --> 00:50:52.115
EMISSIONS FROM NATURAL THE

00:50:52.182 --> 00:50:55.252
WORKING LAND AT ALL THINK.

00:50:55.318 --> 00:50:55.919
WHICH CAN BE NATURAL AND

00:50:55.986 --> 00:50:57.821
WORKING LANDS CARBON CAPTURE

00:50:57.888 --> 00:50:59.189
AND SEQUESTRATION FOR LARGE

00:50:59.256 --> 00:51:02.058
EMITTERS DIRECT AIR CAPTURE AND

00:51:02.125 --> 00:51:04.895
PERMANENT STORAGE OF CO TWO

00:51:04.961 --> 00:51:06.863
FROM THE ATMOSPHERE. THE

00:51:06.930 --> 00:51:08.365
PATHWAY TO CARBON NEUTRALITY

00:51:08.432 --> 00:51:10.500
STUDY DEVELOPED FOR CARP BY

00:51:10.567 --> 00:51:12.035
ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL

00:51:12.102 --> 00:51:14.438
ECONOMICS EXAMINES THREE BROAD

00:51:14.504 --> 00:51:16.773
PATHWAYS. TO ACHIEVING CARBON

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:18.975
NEUTRALITY. EACH PATHWAY

00:51:19.042 --> 00:51:21.211
CHARTED THE SAME PATH 280% OF

00:51:21.278 --> 00:51:24.414
REDUCTIONS THEN CHARTED

00:51:24.481 --> 00:51:25.949
DIFFERENT PATHWAYS AFTER. ONE

00:51:26.016 --> 00:51:27.384
SCENARIO MADE USE OF EXPANDED

00:51:27.451 --> 00:51:28.785
CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL

00:51:28.852 --> 00:51:31.655
STRATEGIES ANOTHER ACHIEVED

00:51:31.721 --> 00:51:34.124
ZERO FOSSIL FUEL EMISSIONS BY

00:51:34.191 --> 00:51:34.758
TWENTY FORTY FIVE AND THE THIRD

00:51:34.825 --> 00:51:36.693
SCENARIO WOULD HAVE BEEN A

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:38.862
BLENDING OF THE TWO. WATER ZERO

00:51:38.929 --> 00:51:40.363
CARBON ENERGY SCENARIO ACHIEVED

00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:42.866
IN 92% REDUCTION IN GREENHOUSE

00:51:42.933 --> 00:51:44.968
GASES BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. THE

00:51:45.035 --> 00:51:46.503
IDEAL BALANCE OF REDUCTIONS

00:51:46.570 --> 00:51:49.206
PURSUE COVERING NOUVEAU REMOVAL

00:51:49.272 --> 00:51:51.007
STRATEGIES IS NOT YET NOW.

00:51:51.074 --> 00:51:52.809
ENTER THIS PROCESS WITH AN OPEN

00:51:52.876 --> 00:51:55.712
MIND ON EVALUATING STRATEGIES.

00:51:55.779 --> 00:51:57.180
BUT AS THE SCALE OF THE CRISIS

00:51:57.247 --> 00:52:00.417
BECOMES CLEARER IT IS BECOMING

00:52:00.484 --> 00:52:02.018
VERY APPARENT THAT WE NEEDED

00:52:02.085 --> 00:52:03.854
NOT ONLY THINK ABOUT REDUCING

00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:05.789
EMISSIONS BUT ALSO WAYS THAT WE

00:52:05.856 --> 00:52:08.124
CAN ACTIVELY REMOVE GREENHOUSE

00:52:08.191 --> 00:52:10.927
GASES FROM THE ATMOSPHERE.

00:52:10.994 --> 00:52:12.262
THERE WILL BE SOME CHANGES TO

00:52:12.329 --> 00:52:13.697
THE DATA AND METRICS FOR THE

00:52:13.763 --> 00:52:17.667
SCOPING PLAN. AS REQUIRED UNDER

00:52:17.734 --> 00:52:18.301
EIGHTY ONE NINETY SEVEN WE WILL

00:52:18.368 --> 00:52:19.603
BE INCLUDING THE COST PER TON

00:52:19.669 --> 00:52:21.972
OF POLICY. THE SOCIAL COST OF

00:52:22.038 --> 00:52:24.441
CARBON. AN ESTIMATED AIR

00:52:24.508 --> 00:52:26.676
QUALITY BENEFITS. WE DO BELIEVE

00:52:26.743 --> 00:52:27.978
THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION WILL

00:52:28.044 --> 00:52:29.779
HAVE UPDATED SOCIAL COST OF

00:52:29.846 --> 00:52:30.881
CARBON VALUES THAT ARE

00:52:30.947 --> 00:52:32.916
PROJECTED TO BE HIGHER THAN THE

00:52:32.983 --> 00:52:34.484
OBAMA ERA VALUES THAT WE USED

00:52:34.551 --> 00:52:36.753
IN THE LAST PLAN THAT WE WILL

00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:38.588
INCORPORATE THAT INTO OUR WORK.

00:52:38.655 --> 00:52:39.890
AND I WORK WITH THE C. E. C.

00:54:52.722 --> 00:54:54.824
ARE PARTICULARLY THOSE MOST

00:54:54.891 --> 00:54:57.861
IMPACTED. AS WAS DISCUSSED AT

00:54:57.927 --> 00:54:59.529
THE OUTSET OF THE HEARING WE

00:54:59.596 --> 00:55:00.830
CANNOT UNDERSTATE HOW

00:55:00.897 --> 00:55:03.233
SIGNIFICANT THE CHALLENGES

00:55:03.299 --> 00:55:05.301
AHEAD ARE. ACHIEVING CARBON

00:55:05.368 --> 00:55:07.537
NEUTRALITY REQUIRES A NEARLY

00:55:07.604 --> 00:55:08.672
COMPLETE TRANSFORMATION OF

00:55:08.738 --> 00:55:11.641
CALIFORNIA FROM A STATE STILL

00:55:11.708 --> 00:55:12.208
HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON FOSSIL

00:55:12.275 --> 00:55:13.810
FUELS. WE DO EVERYTHING FROM

00:55:13.877 --> 00:55:16.413
GET TO WORK THE LIGHTER HOME.

00:55:16.479 --> 00:55:17.681
IT WAS STATE WHERE ALMOST

00:55:17.747 --> 00:55:21.317
EVERYTHNG WE CAN DO IF POWERED

00:55:21.384 --> 00:55:23.353
BY RENEWABLE ENERGY. WE NEED A

00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:25.455
MASSIVE EXPANSION OF CLEAN

00:55:25.522 --> 00:55:27.524
PUBLIC TRANSIT WE NEED CHANGES

00:55:27.590 --> 00:55:28.992
IN HOW WE DESIGN OUR BUILT

00:55:29.059 --> 00:55:31.594
ENVIRONMENT. WE NEED COULD UNDO

00:55:31.661 --> 00:55:33.930
POLICIES AND INCENTIVES THAT

00:55:33.997 --> 00:55:36.666
FAVOUR SPRAWL. WILL NEED TO

00:55:36.733 --> 00:55:37.100
EXPAND OUR REGIONAL

00:55:37.167 --> 00:55:39.102
PARTNERSHIPS. COORDINATE WITH

00:55:39.169 --> 00:55:41.037
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND

00:55:41.104 --> 00:55:42.205
COLLABORATE WITH THE FEDERAL

00:55:42.272 --> 00:55:43.807
GOVERNMENT TO ACHIEVE NATIONAL

00:55:43.873 --> 00:55:46.309
CLIMATE SOLUTIONS THAT BUILD ON

00:55:46.376 --> 00:55:46.876
OUR PIONEERING WORK HERE IN

00:55:46.943 --> 00:55:48.912
CALIFORNIA. WITH THE NEW

00:55:48.978 --> 00:55:50.013
FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION THERE'S

00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:51.347
AN OPPORTUNITY TO NOT ONLY

00:55:51.414 --> 00:55:54.751
EXPORT. OUR POLICIES NATIONALLY

00:55:54.818 --> 00:55:56.319
BUT ALSO WORK TO ACHIEVE

00:55:56.386 --> 00:55:57.821
REDUCTIONS PROTECTORS WE

00:55:57.887 --> 00:55:59.622
CURRENTLY CAN'T REGULATE SUCH

00:55:59.689 --> 00:56:03.426
AS AVIATION AND THE RAIL SECTOR.

00:56:03.493 --> 00:56:05.929
I THANK GOD THE IPCC JUST

00:56:05.995 --> 00:56:07.530
RELEASED A STUDY SHOWING THAT

00:56:07.597 --> 00:56:09.065
RECENT CHANGES IN OUR CLIMATE-

00:56:09.132 --> 00:56:11.267
WIDESPREAD RAPID AND

00:56:11.334 --> 00:56:14.971
INTENSIFYING. ACHIEVING NET

00:56:15.038 --> 00:56:18.975
ZERO IF NECESSARY. YET THIS IS

00:56:19.042 --> 00:56:20.977
AN ALL HANDS ON DECK MOMENT

00:56:21.044 --> 00:56:22.412
THAT REQUIRES OLD COMMITTED

00:56:22.479 --> 00:56:25.248
LEADERSHIP. THE TIME FOR

00:56:25.315 --> 00:56:26.883
QUIBBLING OVER DEFINITELY

00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:29.686
MANISHA OR AGONIZING OVER

00:56:29.753 --> 00:56:31.387
DEMAND IN A SPENDING CHANGES AS

00:56:31.454 --> 00:56:34.124
LONG PASSED. BUT AFTER THAT

00:56:34.190 --> 00:56:37.093
FIRE NO ONE WORRIES THAT THERE

00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:39.229
ARE TOO MANY FIRE TRUCKS. ALL

00:56:39.295 --> 00:56:39.963
THAT MATTERS IS PUTTING OUT THE

00:56:40.029 --> 00:56:42.165
FIRE. IT'S TIME FOR US TO BE

00:56:42.232 --> 00:56:43.099
THINKING ABOUT THE CLIMATE

00:56:43.166 --> 00:56:45.335
CRISIS THE SAME WAY AND TO

00:56:45.401 --> 00:56:47.771
FOCUS ON BOTH PLANS AND ACTION

00:56:47.837 --> 00:56:49.873
AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT.

00:56:49.939 --> 00:56:51.941
THE TASK IS DAUNTING BUT I HAVE

00:56:52.008 --> 00:56:53.109
FAITH WITH THE HEART IN THE

00:56:53.176 --> 00:56:54.611
HARD WORK AND DEDICATION OF OUR

00:56:54.677 --> 00:56:56.279
STAFF WITH THE AMBITION OF

00:56:56.346 --> 00:56:58.281
GREEN ENTREPRENEURS AND THE

00:56:58.348 --> 00:56:59.916
VISION OF THE GOVERNOR AND THE

00:56:59.983 --> 00:57:01.718
LEGISLATURE WE CAN MEET THE

00:57:01.785 --> 00:57:02.886
CHALLENGE AND CREATE A

00:57:02.952 --> 00:57:05.889
HEALTHIER AND MORE EQUITABLE

00:57:05.955 --> 00:57:07.090

DON'T WANT TO THANK YOU- IT

00:57:43.259 --> 00:57:44.527
JUST THAT THE QUESTION THAT

00:57:44.594 --> 00:57:46.095
REALLY THAT I HAVE IS KNOWING

00:57:46.162 --> 00:57:47.764
WHERE WE'RE AT TODAY EVEN WITH

00:57:47.831 --> 00:57:53.369
THE RECENT- IPCC REPORT- AND

00:57:53.436 --> 00:57:55.772
HOW DIRE SITUATION IS. CAN YOU

00:57:55.839 --> 00:57:57.740
TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHETHER

00:57:57.807 --> 00:58:01.010
CURRENT STATE POLICY. NOT A

00:58:01.077 --> 00:58:02.979
WEATHER WE'VE MAXIMIZED.

00:58:03.046 --> 00:58:06.282
EFFICIENCY WITH MAXIMIZED

00:58:06.349 --> 00:58:06.850
DOLLARS THAT ARE BEING

00:58:06.916 --> 00:58:08.985
COLLECTED WHETHER WE'VE

00:58:09.052 --> 00:58:11.154
MAXIMIZE THE THAT THE POLICIES

00:58:11.221 --> 00:58:12.222
THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE TODAY

00:58:12.288 --> 00:58:15.191
HAVE WE USED THOSE POLICIES IN

00:58:15.258 --> 00:58:16.893
THOSE DOLLARS TO BE ABLE TO

00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:19.495
REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

00:58:19.562 --> 00:58:22.732
TO. THE GREATEST EXTENT. WE

00:58:22.799 --> 00:58:25.702
HAVE A LOT MORE TO DO- I THINK

00:58:25.768 --> 00:58:27.370
IT MET WE HAVE BEEN VERY

00:58:27.437 --> 00:58:29.906
EFFECTIVE IN- IN REDUCING

00:58:29.973 --> 00:58:31.741
GREENHOUSE GASES UP TO THIS

00:58:31.808 --> 00:58:33.343
POINT- AND WE HAVE ACHIEVED

00:58:33.409 --> 00:58:35.979
SOME SUCCESSES BUT THE REALITY

00:58:36.045 --> 00:58:36.713
IS IT'S NOT ENOUGH AND IT'S NOT

00:58:36.779 --> 00:58:39.482
FAST ENOUGH- AS I MENTIONED

00:58:39.549 --> 00:58:40.884
THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT

00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:44.621
IMPLEMENTATION- STRATEGIES THAT

00:58:44.687 --> 00:58:47.624
WE NEED TO LEAN INTO- AND WE

00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:50.860
NEED TO DEPLOY ALL OF THE-

00:58:50.927 --> 00:58:52.295
INCENTIVES THAT. THE REGULAR

00:58:52.362 --> 00:58:55.331
START REGULATORY STAT- AND THE

00:58:55.398 --> 00:58:57.333
MARKET MECHANISMS THAT WE CAN

00:58:57.400 --> 00:59:01.170
TO GET WHERE WE NEED TO GO- I

00:59:01.237 --> 00:59:02.372
THANK YOU. YOU KNOW I'LL GIVE A

00:59:02.438 --> 00:59:04.774
SMALL EXAMPLE- ONE OF THE

00:59:04.841 --> 00:59:08.411
CHALLENGES AROUND- INCENTIVE

00:59:08.478 --> 00:59:10.446
PROGRAM IS SORT OF THIS KIND OF

00:59:10.513 --> 00:59:11.681
THE STOP AND START NATURE OF

00:59:11.748 --> 00:59:12.548
THEM YOU KNOW WE'LL HAVE

00:59:12.615 --> 00:59:14.183
FUNDING AND THEN IT'LL RUN OUT

00:59:14.250 --> 00:59:14.817
AND THEN WE'LL GET MORE

00:59:14.884 --> 00:59:17.120
SPENDING OR- WILL RECONSTRUCT

00:59:17.186 --> 00:59:20.456
THE PROGRAM. AND I THINK IT'S

00:59:20.523 --> 00:59:24.827
IT CAN BE CHALLENGING- AND SO-

00:59:24.894 --> 00:59:26.596
THAT'S JUST ONE SMALL EXAMPLE

00:59:26.663 --> 00:59:28.998
OF. AREAS WHERE WE CAN REALLY

00:59:29.065 --> 00:59:31.935
LEAN AND- ANOTHER EXAMPLE AS I

00:59:32.001 --> 00:59:33.970
MENTIONED WAS- THINKING ABOUT

00:59:34.037 --> 00:59:36.272
THE ROLE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS-

00:59:36.339 --> 00:59:40.009
AND- THEIR STRATEGIES AROUND.

00:59:40.076 --> 00:59:41.911
LAND USE AND REDUCING VEHICLE

00:59:41.978 --> 00:59:45.014
MILES TRAVELED AND INCITING-

00:59:45.081 --> 00:59:46.883
RENEWABLE ENERGY FACILITIES

00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:48.618
THINGS LIKE THAT SO WE REALLY

00:59:48.685 --> 00:59:50.320
ALL NEED TO BE WORKING TOGETHER

00:59:50.386 --> 00:59:53.423
AT THE STATE- AS HARD AND AS

00:59:53.489 --> 00:59:55.792
FAST AS WE POSSIBLY CAN. WELL

00:59:55.858 --> 00:59:58.027
THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT-

00:59:58.094 --> 00:59:59.228
AND I GUESS PART OF THIS AND

00:59:59.295 --> 01:00:00.263
YOU BROUGHT UP VEHICLES MOUNT

01:00:00.330 --> 01:00:01.965
THE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED

01:00:02.031 --> 01:00:04.000
WHICH IS A SORE SUBJECT FOR

01:00:04.067 --> 01:00:08.671
AREAS LIKE MINE IN THE INLAND

01:00:08.738 --> 01:00:10.373
BUILDING A MORE AFFORDABLE

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:11.774
HOUSING OR HOUSING THAT'S MORE

01:00:11.841 --> 01:00:13.476
AFFORDABLE THAN IT IS IN. IN

01:00:13.543 --> 01:00:15.511
ORANGE COUNTY AND LA AND YET

01:00:15.578 --> 01:00:16.779
WE'VE GOT POLICIES LIKE V. M.

01:00:16.846 --> 01:00:18.748
T. THAT HAVE SAID ALWAYS WE'RE

01:00:18.815 --> 01:00:20.083
NOT GONNA WE'RE NOT GONNA LIE

01:00:20.149 --> 01:00:21.184
TO BE ABLE TO BUILD ANYMORE

01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:21.951
ROAD SO THERE'S MORE

01:00:22.018 --> 01:00:23.553
TRANSPORTATION ISSUES I WANT TO

01:00:23.619 --> 01:00:25.355
GET GO DOWN THAT ROAD. THE

01:00:25.421 --> 01:00:26.289
REASON PART OF THE REASON I'M

01:00:26.356 --> 01:00:27.557
ASKING THIS QUESTION IS THAT I

01:00:27.623 --> 01:00:28.891
THINK ABOUT HOW WE'RE SPENDING

01:00:28.958 --> 01:00:30.259
MONEY WITH THEM WITHIN THE G.

01:00:30.326 --> 01:00:32.395
G. R. F. FUND- AND I CAN TELL

01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:34.998
YOU. A FOR ME A FEW YEARS AGO I

01:00:35.064 --> 01:00:36.199
WE SPENT A HUNDRED MILLION

01:00:36.265 --> 01:00:38.201
DOLLARS OR MORE ON WATER- WHICH

01:00:38.267 --> 01:00:41.337
BY THE WAY IS. SUPER NEEDED WE

01:00:41.404 --> 01:00:42.038
KNOW NOW WE'RE IN A IN A

01:00:42.105 --> 01:00:44.173
DROUGHT. AND YET I THOUGHT THAT

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:45.775
THE REASON THAT WE USED TO THE

01:00:45.842 --> 01:00:47.477
G. R. F. DOLLARS WERE SUPPOSED

01:00:47.543 --> 01:00:49.245
TO BE USED TOWARD REDUCING

01:00:49.312 --> 01:00:50.780
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND

01:00:50.847 --> 01:00:52.548
SO. IT SEEMS AS THOUGH ON ONE

01:00:52.615 --> 01:00:54.017
SIDE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A

01:00:54.083 --> 01:00:56.886
POLICIES. THAT THAT WERE SAYING

01:00:56.953 --> 01:00:57.553
THAT WERE TALK ABOUT THIS

01:00:57.620 --> 01:01:02.291
OVERALL. PLAN THAT WE'VE GOT TO

01:01:02.358 --> 01:01:02.925
REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

01:01:02.992 --> 01:01:03.559
AT THE WORLD IS. AS FUN AS THIS

01:01:03.626 --> 01:01:04.761
ACCESS TO THREAT BEFORE A- BUT

01:01:04.827 --> 01:01:08.231
TO BE VERY REAL- OUR POLICIES

01:01:08.297 --> 01:01:09.966
AND OUR EXPENDITURES. DON'T

01:01:10.033 --> 01:01:11.968
ALIGN WITH THAT AND SO AGAIN I

01:01:12.035 --> 01:01:13.302
WANT TO GO BACK TO THANKING YOU

01:01:13.369 --> 01:01:15.004

I THINK YOU MADE THAT YOU MADE

01:01:16.472 --> 01:01:17.340

WANT TO KNOW THAT WE CAN HIT

01:02:11.828 --> 01:02:12.361
THE TARGET WITH CONSERVATIVES

01:02:12.428 --> 01:02:15.598
OPTIONS. I'M AND THERE FOR HAVE

01:02:15.665 --> 01:02:16.566
A GOOD CHANCE EXCEEDING THE

01:02:16.632 --> 01:02:18.434
TARGETS ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT

01:02:18.501 --> 01:02:19.936
A CLIMATE PLAN THIS WAY IN THE

01:02:20.002 --> 01:02:24.040
SCOPING PLAN AND- PRINTED PLANT.

01:02:24.107 --> 01:02:24.507
TO GET A PLANTS WILL

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:25.942
CONSERVATIVELY HIT THE TARGETS

01:02:26.008 --> 01:02:26.843
THAT WILL POTENTIALLY

01:02:26.909 --> 01:02:28.778
OVERACHIEVE. IF THINGS GO WELL

01:02:28.845 --> 01:02:30.246
OR WE RISK THAT IF ANY OF THESE

01:02:30.313 --> 01:02:32.682
POLICIES DON'T GO AS PREDICTED

01:02:32.748 --> 01:02:33.216
THAT WE WILL MISS OUR- OUR

01:02:33.282 --> 01:02:38.721
TARGETS. NAY ALLEN. I GUESS I

01:02:38.788 --> 01:02:41.524
WOULD SAY A COUPLE THINGS- DEAN

01:02:41.591 --> 01:02:43.392
THE PURPOSE OF THE SCOPING PLAN

01:02:43.459 --> 01:02:45.928
IS. REALLY TO KIND OF LAY OUT

01:02:45.995 --> 01:02:48.664
THAT STRATEGY AND LOOKING AT

01:02:48.731 --> 01:02:52.101
DIFFERENT- TIME FRAMES LIKE.

01:02:52.168 --> 01:02:54.637
LOOKING AND TO TWENTY THIRTY

01:02:54.704 --> 01:02:55.238
FIVE FOR CARBON NEUTRALITY AS

01:02:55.304 --> 01:02:56.973
WELL AS TWENTY FORTY FIVE. WILL

01:02:57.039 --> 01:02:59.041
REALLY GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY

01:02:59.108 --> 01:03:01.277
TO THINK ABOUT. WAYS THAT WE

01:03:01.344 --> 01:03:03.279
CAN MOVE FASTER IN IN DIFFERENT

01:03:03.346 --> 01:03:07.116
AREAS- AND FULLY ANALYZING HOW

01:03:07.183 --> 01:03:09.218
MUCH. EACH OF OUR PROGRAMS WE

01:03:09.285 --> 01:03:11.020
ANTICIPATE TO ACHIEVE THE

01:03:11.087 --> 01:03:13.689
REDUCTIONS THAT WE NEED- WE

01:03:13.756 --> 01:03:15.958
WERE FORTUNATE WE REACHED OUR

01:03:16.025 --> 01:03:16.559
TWENTY TWENTY GOALS A SENIOR

01:03:16.626 --> 01:03:19.128
THAN WE THOUGHT- SO I THINK WE

01:03:19.195 --> 01:03:22.231
HAVE- EFFECTIVELY LAID OUT

01:03:22.298 --> 01:03:24.167
STRATEGIES THAT HAVE THE

01:03:24.233 --> 01:03:26.469
POTENTIAL TO- CAN MOVE. MORE

01:03:26.536 --> 01:03:28.004
QUICKLY- AND THAT'LL BE

01:03:28.070 --> 01:03:32.408
SOMETHING THAT WE WILL BE-

01:03:32.475 --> 01:03:32.942
ANALYZING IN THE SKIPPING

01:03:33.009 --> 01:03:39.081
PLANET. THANK YOU. I DON'T

01:03:39.148 --> 01:03:42.351
SKINNER I'M CHAIR AND OFF YOU

01:03:42.418 --> 01:03:45.555
MENTIONED THAT THE- SCENARIO

01:03:45.621 --> 01:03:47.356
THE- REPORT THAT YOU RECEIVED

01:03:47.423 --> 01:03:50.359
THE SCENARIOS THAT GAVE THE SAY

01:03:50.426 --> 01:03:52.828
IT WELL IN FACT HAD THE SAME

01:03:52.895 --> 01:03:54.797
MEASURES FOR REACHING 80% BUT

01:03:54.864 --> 01:03:56.199
THEN THE 20% WERE DIFFERENT

01:03:56.265 --> 01:04:00.803
OPTIONS- AND IT I THINK IF I

01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:02.371
HEARD IT RIGHT BUT I MAY HAVE

01:04:02.438 --> 01:04:04.941
NOT HEARD CORRECTLY THE ONLY

01:04:05.007 --> 01:04:07.176
ONE OF THE THREE OPTIONS WAS A

01:04:07.243 --> 01:04:09.745
MORE FOCUSED ON THE CAPTURING

01:04:09.812 --> 01:04:12.415
AND SEQUESTERING OF CARBON. IS

01:04:12.481 --> 01:04:17.119
THAT ACCURATE. RIGHT RIGHT SO

01:04:17.186 --> 01:04:20.523
ONE LEANED INTO AND THAT HE

01:04:20.590 --> 01:04:22.391
NEEDED TO THAT OF THE STRATEGY

01:04:22.458 --> 01:04:23.226
I'M ALONE I'M JUST DOUBLE

01:04:23.292 --> 01:04:24.360
CHECKING MY NOTES I WANT TO

01:04:24.427 --> 01:04:25.461
MAKE SURE I'M NOT GIVING YOU

01:04:25.528 --> 01:04:30.066
THEIR- INFORMATION- AND THEN

01:04:30.132 --> 01:04:32.401
THE- AT ONES THAT ARE YELLOW.

01:04:32.468 --> 01:04:34.203
AT LEANED HEAVILY INTO THAT

01:04:34.270 --> 01:04:36.172
REMOVAL STRATEGIES WHILE THE

01:04:36.239 --> 01:04:39.742
OTHER SCENARIO- LEANED INTO AT

01:04:39.809 --> 01:04:41.611
JERRY WE MISSION SO OKAY OKAY

01:04:41.677 --> 01:04:42.678
THING MORE ON REDUCING

01:04:42.745 --> 01:04:43.913
EMISSIONS AND THEN THE THIRD

01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:46.115
SCENARIO DID A COMBINATION OF

01:04:46.182 --> 01:04:50.753
COMBO OKAY. SO OF THE 80% HOW

01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:53.389
MUCH WAS REMOVAL FACTORED IN IN

01:04:53.456 --> 01:04:57.526
JUST GETTING TO THE 80% WAS IT.

01:04:57.593 --> 01:04:58.027
OR WAS IT PRIMARILY ARMS

01:04:58.094 --> 01:05:00.563
REDUCTION IT WAS PRIMARILY IN

01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:06.369
THIS INTRODUCTION OKAY- AND

01:05:06.435 --> 01:05:07.203
THERE ARE THESE THE ONLY

01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:09.305
SCENARIOS THE BOARD IS GOING TO

01:05:09.372 --> 01:05:11.540
LOOK AT THE REASON I RAISE IT-

01:05:11.607 --> 01:05:13.242
YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW. OKAY GO

01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:15.845
AHEAD. YEAH I THOUGHT SORRY TO

01:05:15.911 --> 01:05:16.712
INTERRUPT BUT I JUST WANT TO

01:05:16.779 --> 01:05:18.114
MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THE DANCE

01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:20.283
THAT WAS THE CARBON NEUTRALITY

01:05:20.349 --> 01:05:21.250
STUDY THAT WAS DONE BY E

01:05:21.317 --> 01:05:24.220
THREE- AND WE WILL BE LOOKING

01:05:24.287 --> 01:05:26.088
AT A MUCH BROADER SUITE OF

01:05:26.155 --> 01:05:27.757
POSSIBLE SCENARIOS. IN THE

01:05:27.823 --> 01:05:30.293
SCOPING PLAN OKAY- AND THE

01:05:30.359 --> 01:05:31.627
REASON I REASON AND I DON'T I

01:05:31.694 --> 01:05:34.397
MEAN OBVIOUSLY I. I DO WANT TO

01:05:34.463 --> 01:05:35.564
ASK QUESTIONS AND HAVE THE

01:05:35.631 --> 01:05:36.832
ANSWERS BUT I'LL AND I DON'T

01:05:36.899 --> 01:05:37.933
WANT TO JUST BE SETTING UP

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.802
QUESTIONS FOR LEADING LEADING

01:05:39.869 --> 01:05:43.172
YOU TO I'M- GOING TO EXPRESS

01:05:43.239 --> 01:05:44.073
THE OPINION THAT I THINK THAT.

01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:50.046
WE- THAT WE NEED TO HAVE

01:05:50.112 --> 01:05:52.748
REMOVAL EVEN IN OUR 80% AND

01:05:52.815 --> 01:05:55.318
THAT AND I DON'T MEAN I IN NO

01:05:55.384 --> 01:05:57.653
WAY WANT TO DIMINISH. THE

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:59.722
EMISSIONS REDUCTION SO I AM NOT

01:05:59.789 --> 01:06:01.791
ADVOCATING THAT WE MOVE AWAY

01:06:01.857 --> 01:06:04.694
FROM THAT EMPHASIS I'M ONLY

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:08.264
ALSO ADVOCATING. THAT WE AT WE

01:06:08.331 --> 01:06:10.266
CONCURRENTLY PUT AS MUCH

01:06:10.333 --> 01:06:12.735
EMPHASIS ON THE REMOVAL GIVEN

01:06:12.802 --> 01:06:16.005
WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW.

01:06:16.072 --> 01:06:18.074
ABSOLUTELY I COMPLETELY AGREE I

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:19.342
MEAN I THINK ONE OF THE KEY

01:06:19.408 --> 01:06:20.943
STRATEGIES FOR THIS ROUND OF

01:06:21.010 --> 01:06:23.346
THE SCOPING PLAN IS REALLY- IT

01:06:23.412 --> 01:06:24.680
DIVING INTO WHAT ARE THE

01:06:24.747 --> 01:06:26.115
OPPORTUNITIES AND NATURALLY

01:06:26.182 --> 01:06:27.750
WORKING LAND AND THEN WHAT OUR

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:30.786
TECHNOLOGICAL OPPORTUNITIES-

01:06:30.853 --> 01:06:33.389
BUT BY NO MEANS ARE WE GOING TO

01:06:33.456 --> 01:06:36.659
I'M NOT ALSO CONSIDER- THE

01:06:36.726 --> 01:06:38.094
EMISSIONS REDUCTION SO. I THINK

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:39.962
WE ARE IN COMPLETE ALIGNMENT ON

01:06:40.029 --> 01:06:41.130
AND REALLY MAKE REALLY

01:06:41.197 --> 01:06:43.232
UNDERSTANDING WAYS THAT WE CAN

01:06:43.299 --> 01:06:48.671
REMOVE CARBON- AS WE TRY TO YOU

01:06:48.738 --> 01:06:52.575
KNOW. ADDRESS THAT CRISIS.

01:06:52.641 --> 01:06:58.881
THANK YOU. FOLLOWING CENTER

01:06:58.948 --> 01:07:01.350
SCANNERS- QUESTIONS REGARDING

01:07:01.417 --> 01:07:04.320
THE IMPORTANCE OF CARBON

01:07:04.387 --> 01:07:07.757
REMOVAL- TECHNOLOGIES I- I'M

01:07:07.823 --> 01:07:11.293
REFERRING CHAIR AROUND OFF- TO.

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:14.563
A COPY OF THE- THE PATHWAYS

01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:16.232
STUDY THAT I BELIEVE YOU'RE

01:07:16.298 --> 01:07:18.334
REFERRING TO THAT THE- WE'RE

01:07:18.401 --> 01:07:20.069
EXPLORING THAT THE THREE-

01:07:20.136 --> 01:07:23.105
POTENTIAL. BROAD PATHWAYS IN

01:07:23.172 --> 01:07:25.274
ACHIEVING CARBON NEUTRALITY BY

01:07:25.341 --> 01:07:28.144
TWENTY FORTY FIVE ARM. AND IN

01:07:28.210 --> 01:07:32.314
THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF THE R.

01:07:32.381 --> 01:07:34.817
PATHWAY STUDY- IT TALKS ABOUT

01:07:34.884 --> 01:07:39.955
HOW. WHILE THE- THIS IS

01:07:40.022 --> 01:07:41.457
ANDERSON ERROR RESULTS IN THE

01:07:41.524 --> 01:07:42.925
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY UNDER THE

01:07:42.992 --> 01:07:46.629
HIGH. CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL

01:07:46.695 --> 01:07:49.498
SCENARIO THAT- THAT THIS

01:07:49.565 --> 01:07:51.600
SCENARIO RELIES ON QUOTE

01:07:51.667 --> 01:07:54.003
RELATIVELY UNTESTED CARBON

01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:56.105
DIOXIDE REMOVAL STRATEGIES-

01:07:56.172 --> 01:07:57.440
WHICH ARE NOT WIDELY

01:07:57.506 --> 01:08:00.709
COMMERCIALIZED. COULD YOU-

01:08:00.776 --> 01:08:02.244
ASCHE SHARE YOUR OPINION IN

01:08:02.311 --> 01:08:05.314
TERMS OF. YOU KNOW WHAT IS.

01:08:05.381 --> 01:08:10.052
THE- WHAT WHAT WHERE WE ADD IN

01:08:10.119 --> 01:08:13.355
TERMS OF THE- THE- THE

01:08:13.422 --> 01:08:18.994
RELIABILITY AND THE- THE TESTED

01:08:19.061 --> 01:08:20.729
THE NATURE OF THE OF THESE

01:08:20.796 --> 01:08:23.399
TECHNOLOGIES I MEAN I MY

01:08:23.466 --> 01:08:25.000
QUESTION IS REALLY TRYING TO

01:08:25.067 --> 01:08:27.102
GET A GET OUT WHETHER WE ARE

01:08:27.169 --> 01:08:28.237
YOU KNOW WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:08:28.304 --> 01:08:29.271
THAT WE PUT OUR EGGS IN THE

01:08:29.338 --> 01:08:31.440
BASKET OF REAL TECHNOLOGY THAT

01:08:31.507 --> 01:08:36.078
ACHIEVE REAL. REDUCTIONS.

01:08:36.145 --> 01:08:39.315
WHETHER IN- CAPTURING CARBON

01:08:39.381 --> 01:08:41.050
BEFORE RELEASED OR WHETHER AND

01:08:41.116 --> 01:08:44.753
REMOVING. CARBON THROUGH THE

01:08:44.820 --> 01:08:47.623
SINKS CAN CAN YOU GIVE US. A

01:08:47.690 --> 01:08:49.625
SENSE OF- SOME OF THE STATE OF

01:08:49.692 --> 01:08:53.028
THE CARBON- REMOVAL A

01:08:53.095 --> 01:08:53.562
TECHNOLOGY AS IT CURRENTLY

01:08:53.629 --> 01:08:57.500
STANDS. YES ABSOLUTELY- WE

01:08:57.566 --> 01:09:00.102
RECENTLY HAD A- WORKSHOP ON

01:09:00.169 --> 01:09:01.871
THIS TOPIC WHERE WE HAVE THE

01:09:01.937 --> 01:09:03.105
OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS SOME OF

01:09:03.172 --> 01:09:06.075
THE KEY POLICY ISSUES AROUND-

01:09:06.141 --> 01:09:08.477
CARBON CAPTURE AND REMOVAL AND

01:09:08.544 --> 01:09:10.946
THEN ALSO HAD. SOME

01:09:11.013 --> 01:09:13.215
PRESENTATIONS ABOUT DIFFERENT-

01:09:13.282 --> 01:09:16.819
PROJECTS THAT EXIST- AND I

01:09:16.886 --> 01:09:18.854
GUESS I WOULD SORT OF JAM IT UP

01:09:18.921 --> 01:09:21.056
BY SAYING IT'S EARLY DAYS-

01:09:21.123 --> 01:09:23.125
THERE ARE AND THERE ARE

01:09:23.192 --> 01:09:26.161
STRATEGIES THAT ARE- THAT HAVE

01:09:26.228 --> 01:09:27.930
BEEN DEPLOYED- BUT THERE'S

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:31.333
STILL A LOT OF. QUESTIONS ABOUT

01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:32.668
AND F WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THE

01:09:32.735 --> 01:09:35.170
STATE OF CALIFORNIA HOW EXACTLY

01:09:35.237 --> 01:09:36.472
AT THESE PROJECTS TO BE

01:09:36.539 --> 01:09:38.374
DEPLOYED WHAT TYPES OF- WHAT

01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:41.243
THE DIFFERENT. OPTIONS ARE AND

01:09:41.310 --> 01:09:42.611
WHAT SOME OF THE CONCERNS ARE

01:09:42.678 --> 01:09:45.147
I'M THINKING ABOUT- AIR QUALITY

01:09:45.214 --> 01:09:46.982
ISSUES ARE THINKING ABOUT-

01:09:47.049 --> 01:09:48.884
PERMANENCY AS RUDE AS IT

01:09:48.951 --> 01:09:50.553
RELATES TO SEE FRUSTRATION AND

01:09:50.619 --> 01:09:52.288
NEITHER ARE REALLY IMPORTANT

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:53.522
KEY THINGS THAT NEED TO BE

01:09:53.589 --> 01:09:55.257
DISCUSSED- AS PART OF THE

01:09:55.324 --> 01:09:57.893
SCOPING PLAN PROCESS- SO THAT

01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:00.195
WE CAN UNDERSTAND- HOW WE

01:10:00.262 --> 01:10:01.297
CHARACTERIZE IT AND HOW WE

01:10:01.363 --> 01:10:02.698
THINK ABOUT IT AND IN THE

01:10:02.765 --> 01:10:04.199
CONTEXT OF THE SUITE OF

01:10:04.266 --> 01:10:06.869
STRATEGIES- AS I'VE AS I

01:10:06.936 --> 01:10:08.637
MENTIONED EARLIER AND I SAY ALL

01:10:08.704 --> 01:10:11.273
THE TIME- THIS IS REALLY THIS

01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:13.576
IS NOT AN EITHER OR KIND OF.

01:10:13.642 --> 01:10:16.111
MOMENT DIFFER THEY LET'S SEE

01:10:16.178 --> 01:10:18.347
BUT- HE WAS MUCH AS WE CAN AND

01:10:18.414 --> 01:10:19.548
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING TO BE

01:10:19.615 --> 01:10:21.850
THE MOST EFFECTIVE- AND SO

01:10:21.917 --> 01:10:26.689
THAT'S A LOT OF WHAT THE.

01:10:26.755 --> 01:10:27.256
WORKING THE SKIPPING PLAN IS

01:10:27.323 --> 01:10:28.090
GOING TO BE ABOUT. YES I AND I

01:10:28.157 --> 01:10:30.092
CERTAINLY. YOUR CALL FOR BOLD

01:10:30.159 --> 01:10:32.661
ACTION WERE. AND THIS IS NOT A

01:10:32.728 --> 01:10:34.997

LEGISLATURE VIEWS- THE

01:13:02.010 --> 01:13:03.078
DIFFERENT STRATEGIES THE

PLAYS TOGETHER. IT'S GOING TO

01:13:09.384 --> 01:13:10.285

BETWEEN THE DIRECT EMISSION

01:13:21.363 --> 01:13:24.099
REDUCTIONS VERSES THE- RELIANCE

01:13:24.166 --> 01:13:27.703
ON. CARBON CAPTURE AND

01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:30.139
SEQUESTRATION TECHNOLOGIES AS

01:13:30.205 --> 01:13:36.879
WELL AS NATURAL- SOLUTIONS- IF

01:13:36.945 --> 01:13:38.714
EFFORT FIRST FALL EVERITT WHICH

01:13:38.781 --> 01:13:40.549
WHICH YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT-

THAT THERE ARE CO BENEFITS TO

01:13:42.618 --> 01:13:44.219
THE EMPHASIS ON THE DIRECT

01:13:44.286 --> 01:13:46.989
EMISSION REDUCTIONS NAMELY THE

01:13:47.055 --> 01:13:48.824
ODD AND NOT JUST IT SHAVING THE

01:13:48.891 --> 01:13:50.592
CARBON NEUTRALITY GOALS NOT

01:13:50.659 --> 01:13:52.227
JUST IN ITS EVEN THE GREENHOUSE

01:13:52.294 --> 01:13:55.497
GAS REDUCTION GOALS BUT ALSO

01:13:55.564 --> 01:13:56.865
THE- ACHIEVING THE AIR

01:13:56.932 --> 01:13:58.867
POLLUTION REDUCTIONS IN. THE

01:13:58.934 --> 01:14:00.836
AND OUR FRONT LINE COMMUNITIES

01:14:00.903 --> 01:14:02.871
WITH AN EMPHASIS ON THE DIRECT

01:14:02.938 --> 01:14:09.211
EMISSION REDUCTIONS. YES I MEAN

01:14:09.278 --> 01:14:13.148
I THINK THAT I THINK WE KNOW

THAT- AB ONE NINETY SEVEN YOU

01:14:17.085 --> 01:14:19.121
KNOW REQUIRES US TO BE- MEANING

01:14:19.188 --> 01:14:21.056

01:14:21.123 --> 01:14:24.026
REDUCTIONS AND- AND WE HAVE

01:14:24.092 --> 01:14:25.360

ACHIEVE BOTH AND I THINK IT'S

01:14:26.795 --> 01:14:28.897
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT A LOT OF

01:14:28.964 --> 01:14:31.333
THE WORK- REGARDING DIRECT

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:33.669

THE AIR DISTRICT LEVEL- A

01:14:35.704 --> 01:14:37.372
COUPLE OF RECENT EXAMPLES WHERE

01:14:37.439 --> 01:14:38.774

OPERATIONS SO THAT WORK

01:14:52.321 --> 01:14:56.491
CONTINUES- AND- AND AS YOU

01:14:56.558 --> 01:14:58.894

FORTY FIVE- AND MORE RECENTLY

01:15:35.197 --> 01:15:36.231

TIMELINE TO TWENTY THIRTY FIVE-

01:16:00.255 --> 01:16:04.259
TIMELINE. I GUESS THE WAY I

01:16:04.326 --> 01:16:06.261
WOULD ARTICULATED IS THAT WHAT

YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT A TWENTY

01:16:08.397 --> 01:16:09.765
THIRTY FIVE GOAL YOU'RE REALLY

01:16:09.831 --> 01:16:12.634

SHORT TIME FRAME INTO YOU'RE

01:16:14.069 --> 01:16:15.704
REALLY THINKING ABOUT THE

01:16:15.771 --> 01:16:16.905
TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE ALREADY

01:16:16.972 --> 01:16:20.442
HAVE THAT ARE EITHER. YOU KNOW

01:16:20.509 --> 01:16:24.613
IN THE MARKET OR ARE ABOUT TO-

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:27.082
REACH MARKET- AND REACH MORE

01:16:27.149 --> 01:16:29.184
WIDESPREAD ADOPTION. IF YOU'RE

01:16:29.251 --> 01:16:30.719
THINKING ABOUT TWENTY FORTY

01:16:30.786 --> 01:16:33.322
FIVE- YOU YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME

01:16:33.388 --> 01:16:34.856
FLEXIBILITY AND THINKING ABOUT

01:16:34.923 --> 01:16:37.192
OKAY WHAT WHAT MIGHT THE FUTURE

01:16:37.259 --> 01:16:39.761
HOLD- WHAT MIGHT WE SEE IN

01:16:39.828 --> 01:16:42.531
TERMS OF- NEW TYPES OF

01:16:42.597 --> 01:16:44.032
BATTERIES FOR INSTANCE YOU KNOW

01:16:44.099 --> 01:16:45.400
WILL THERE BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:16:45.467 --> 01:16:47.102
MOVE BEYOND LITHIUM ION YOU

01:16:47.169 --> 01:16:48.937
KNOW. HOW ARE WE THINKING ABOUT

01:16:49.004 --> 01:16:52.874
ARE THERE GOING TO BE ANY- AT.

01:16:52.941 --> 01:16:54.710
ANY ENERGY STRATEGIES THAT WE

01:16:54.776 --> 01:16:56.378
DON'T YET HAVE RIGHT NOW THAT

01:16:56.445 --> 01:17:00.415
WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DEPLOY- SO

01:17:00.482 --> 01:17:03.385
I THINK AS AS YOU LOOK AT THE-

01:17:03.452 --> 01:17:05.387
THE DIFFERENT TIME FRAMES- WHEN

01:17:05.454 --> 01:17:07.322
YOU CAN GET ABOUT TWENTY THIRTY

01:17:07.389 --> 01:17:07.889
FIVE YOU'RE REALLY THINKING

01:17:07.956 --> 01:17:09.424
ABOUT OKAY WHAT HERE IN FRONT

01:17:09.491 --> 01:17:13.862
OF US- IN EITHER. SITUATION YOU

01:17:13.929 --> 01:17:14.863
KNOW YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO BE

01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:17.132
THINKING ABOUT WHAT ARE THE

01:17:17.199 --> 01:17:19.301
AND- THE RIGHT COST EFFECTIVE

01:17:19.368 --> 01:17:21.036
STRATEGIES AND HOW ARE YOU

01:17:21.103 --> 01:17:24.039
GOING TO BE- INCENTIVIZING THEM

01:17:24.106 --> 01:17:25.640
AND ROLLING THEM OUT AND

01:17:25.707 --> 01:17:27.909
DEPLOYING THEM IN AN EFFECTIVE

01:17:27.976 --> 01:17:30.145
WAY AND THAT'S TRUE- AT WHICH

01:17:30.212 --> 01:17:31.847
EITHER A TIME FRAME THAT YOU'RE

01:17:31.913 --> 01:17:34.950
THINKING ABOUT. ALL RIGHT

01:17:35.017 --> 01:17:36.351
UNLIKE MY LAST QUESTION FOR NOW

01:17:36.418 --> 01:17:42.491
IS. AGAIN GOING TO THAT- THAT

01:17:42.557 --> 01:17:44.860
THE BALANCING ACT BETWEEN THE

01:17:44.926 --> 01:17:45.761
DIRECT EMISSION REDUCTIONS

01:17:45.827 --> 01:17:49.064
VERSUS- THE RELIANCE ON CARBON

01:17:49.131 --> 01:17:51.833
CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION. IN

01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:52.801
YOUR OPINION SHOULD THE

01:17:52.868 --> 01:17:55.037
LEGISLATURE- REQUIRE A MINIMUM

01:17:55.103 --> 01:17:57.472
LEVEL OF EMISSION RDUCTIONS-

01:17:57.539 --> 01:17:58.373
THAT MUST BE ACHIEVED IN

01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:01.243
CALIFORNIA. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE

01:18:01.309 --> 01:18:06.681
OUR CARBON NEUTRALITY GOAL. I

01:18:06.748 --> 01:18:12.354
THINK HE- THE IMPORTANCE OF THE

01:18:12.421 --> 01:18:14.790
SCOPING PLAN PROCESS IS THAT

01:18:14.856 --> 01:18:17.659
EVERY FIVE YEARS WE GET TO LOOK

01:18:17.726 --> 01:18:20.662
AT WHERE WE ARE. AND WHAT WE'VE

01:18:20.729 --> 01:18:22.531
ACHIEVED WHAT WE HAVEN'T

01:18:22.597 --> 01:18:24.166
ACHIEVED AND WHERE WE NEED TO

01:18:24.232 --> 01:18:26.501
GO NOW. AND I THINK THE

01:18:26.568 --> 01:18:28.236
IMPORTANCE OF THAT CAREFUL

01:18:28.303 --> 01:18:30.672
DETAILED ANALYSIS THAT

01:18:30.739 --> 01:18:33.708

HAPPENING IN THE REAL WORLD. I

01:18:40.782 --> 01:18:43.418
THINK THAT PROCESS IS THE RIGHT

01:18:43.485 --> 01:18:47.322
PROCESS YOU THINK ABOUT.

01:18:47.389 --> 01:18:48.790
MAINTAINING THAT NEEDED THE

01:18:48.857 --> 01:18:52.794
FLEXIBILITY TO GET TO THE GOAL

01:18:52.861 --> 01:18:55.664

ISSUES YOUR CON AND HOW YOUR-

01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:13.448
SEEING THEIR WORK MOVING

01:19:13.515 --> 01:19:14.983
FORWARD HI GIVEN SOME OF THE

01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:16.718
THINGS WE'RE HEARING KIND OF

01:19:16.785 --> 01:19:19.187
THE WHITE HOUSE. AND ALSO OTHER

01:19:19.254 --> 01:19:26.194
STATES. SURE WE AT CARP HAVE

01:19:26.261 --> 01:19:28.964
ENGAGED- WITH THE FEDERAL

01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:31.533
EMIGRATE FOR MANY YEARS AND-

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:34.035
AND WHEN I STARTED MY POSITION

01:19:34.102 --> 01:19:36.438
I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE-

01:19:36.505 --> 01:19:37.839
YOU KNOW A NEW ADMINISTRATION

01:19:37.906 --> 01:19:39.441
THAT WAS- INTERESTED IN THE

01:19:39.508 --> 01:19:43.912
SAME GOALS WE WERE- AND SO- WE

01:19:43.979 --> 01:19:47.315
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO. ENGAGE WITH

01:19:47.382 --> 01:19:49.050
THEM AND REALLY ADVOCATE ON

01:19:49.117 --> 01:19:50.318
SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE

01:19:50.385 --> 01:19:52.020
THINK ARE REALLY CRITICAL NEXT

01:19:52.087 --> 01:19:56.825
STEPS- THE NEW- EMISSION

01:19:56.892 --> 01:19:58.960
STANDARDS- IN LIGHT DUTY

01:19:59.027 --> 01:20:01.930
VEHICLES BUT ALSO- THINKING

01:20:01.997 --> 01:20:03.899
ABOUT WHERE- THE FEDERAL

01:20:03.965 --> 01:20:06.234
LEADERSHIP CAN BE IN FEDERALLY

01:20:06.301 --> 01:20:10.405
REGULATED SOURCES- SO THAT.

01:20:10.472 --> 01:20:11.706
ASKING THEM TO CONSIDER

01:20:11.773 --> 01:20:13.441
ADOPTING SOMETHING SIMILAR TO

01:20:13.508 --> 01:20:15.644
OUR LOW NOT OMNIBUS RULE TO

01:20:15.710 --> 01:20:18.914
CLEAN UP- TRACKING NATIONWIDE-

01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:21.149
THE THINKING ABOUT ACTORS LAKE

01:20:21.216 --> 01:20:24.553
LOCOMOTIVES AND AVIATION- AND

01:20:24.619 --> 01:20:25.720
SO WE HAVE REALLY BEEN

01:20:25.787 --> 01:20:29.858
ADVOCATING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL-

01:20:29.925 --> 01:20:31.960
THAT. THAT MAY INTO THE STRAW

01:20:32.027 --> 01:20:34.796
THAT WILL HAVE NATIONWIDE- AND

01:20:34.863 --> 01:20:37.032
WORLDWIDE BENEFITS- BUT AS WE

01:20:37.098 --> 01:20:40.268
MENTIONED EARLIER- YOU KNOW WE

01:20:40.335 --> 01:20:42.070
NEED THE WHOLE COUNTRY TO BE

01:20:42.137 --> 01:20:45.373
MOVING IN THE SAME DIRECTION-

01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:47.342
SO AND THEN OF COURSE THE BIG

01:20:47.409 --> 01:20:48.043
DISCUSSION AROUND

01:20:48.109 --> 01:20:50.212
INFRASTRUCTURE- IS REALLY

01:20:50.278 --> 01:20:52.581
IMPORTANT THE- INVESTMENTS THAT

01:20:52.647 --> 01:20:56.218
WE NEED TO BE. IN AT VERY

01:20:56.284 --> 01:20:59.421
MISSION TECHNOLOGIES AND- AND

01:20:59.487 --> 01:21:01.690
THAT THE HEALING INFRASTRUCTURE

01:21:01.756 --> 01:21:03.925

WE HAVE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL-

01:21:07.762 --> 01:21:09.631
AND SO I THINK I AM VERY

01:21:09.698 --> 01:21:12.167
OPTIMISTIC- THAT WE CAN MAKE IT

01:21:12.234 --> 01:21:18.540

PRESENTATION HERE ONE WHAT WE

01:25:30.058 --> 01:25:32.026
KNOW ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

01:25:32.093 --> 01:25:33.461
THE STATE'S PROGRAMS THAT WE

01:25:33.528 --> 01:25:36.030
HAVE RIGHT NOW- TO ARE WE ON

01:25:36.097 --> 01:25:38.566
TRACK TO MEET THE STATE'S SB

01:25:38.633 --> 01:25:39.334
THIRTY TWO GOALS IN TWENTY

01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:40.802
THIRTY. AND THREE WHAT ARE THE

01:25:40.869 --> 01:25:42.036
IMPLICATIONS OF CAN ANSWER

01:25:42.103 --> 01:25:44.005
STUDENTS QUESTIOS FOR A LONG

01:25:44.072 --> 01:25:45.840
TERM CARBON NEUTRALITY GOALS.

01:25:45.907 --> 01:25:46.808
ARE SO BEFORE I KIND OF GET

01:25:46.875 --> 01:25:48.409
INTO THOSE QUESTIONS I DID JUST

01:25:48.476 --> 01:25:50.011
WANT TO REITERATE A COUPLE

01:25:50.078 --> 01:25:50.845
THINGS AND PROVIDE JUST A

01:25:50.912 --> 01:25:52.647
LITTLE BIT MORE CONTEXT AT SOME

01:25:52.714 --> 01:25:55.149
OF THIS DISCUSSION- AS CHAIR

01:25:55.216 --> 01:25:57.385
RANDOLPH MENTIONS AND AS I'M

01:25:57.452 --> 01:25:58.119
SURE ALL OF YOU KNOW WE'VE MET

01:25:58.186 --> 01:26:00.288
OUR- TWENTY TWENTY GOAL EARLY

01:26:00.355 --> 01:26:03.124
BUT THE TWENTY THIRTY GOAL- WE

01:26:03.191 --> 01:26:03.758
HAVE AS MUCH MORE AMBITIOUS AND

01:26:03.825 --> 01:26:06.561
JUSTIN. QUANTITATIVE TERMS THE

01:26:06.628 --> 01:26:07.829
ANNUAL REDUCTIONS NEEDED TO

01:26:07.896 --> 01:26:10.098
MEET OUR THE TWENTY TWENTY GOAL

01:26:10.164 --> 01:26:12.200
IS ABOUT ONE PERSON PER YEAR-

01:26:12.267 --> 01:26:13.735
WHEREAS THE REDUCTIONS NEEDED

01:26:13.801 --> 01:26:14.969
TO MEET THE TWENTY THIRTY GOALS

01:26:15.036 --> 01:26:17.238
ABOUT 4% PER YEAR SO THAT'S A-

01:26:17.305 --> 01:26:18.773
BIG DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF. THE

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:21.809
LEVEL OF AMBITION- AND AS FAR

01:26:21.876 --> 01:26:23.044
AS CERTAIN MEETING OUR GOALS SO

01:26:23.111 --> 01:26:25.647
FAR- AGAIN COMPANIES YOUR

01:26:25.713 --> 01:26:27.315
PROBABLY ALL WELL WELL AWARE OF

01:26:27.382 --> 01:26:29.117
BUT THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR

01:26:29.183 --> 01:26:29.751
EMISSIONS HAVE REALLY BEEN THE

01:26:29.817 --> 01:26:32.353
LARGEST CONTRIBUTOR TO THE

01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:34.589
REDUCTION SO FAR- BUT IN ORDER

01:26:34.656 --> 01:26:35.924
TO MAKE THAT MORE AMBITIOUS

01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.524
TWENTY THIRTY GOAL IT'S GONNA

01:26:36.591 --> 01:26:38.626
REQUIRE REDUCTIONS FROM OTHER

01:26:38.693 --> 01:26:44.165
AREAS BESIDES JUST. THE

01:26:44.232 --> 01:26:46.401
ELECTRICITY SECTOR- THEY ARE

01:26:46.467 --> 01:26:47.135
THING I JUST WANTED TO ON THIS

01:26:47.201 --> 01:26:50.138
HAS. AS I DO KNOW BRIAN OF

01:26:50.204 --> 01:26:51.539
POWER I'M NOT TO WALK ALL OF

01:26:51.606 --> 01:26:53.308
THEM. AROUND OFF ON A LOT OF

01:26:53.374 --> 01:26:55.577
THEM INCLUDING RIGHT. AND SEND.

01:26:55.643 --> 01:26:57.779
CAP AND TRADE- I THINK FROM OUR

01:26:57.845 --> 01:26:59.314
OFFICES PERSPECTIVE WHAT KIND

01:26:59.380 --> 01:27:00.281
OF SOME OF THE FRAMING THAT WE

01:27:00.348 --> 01:27:02.317
USED TO THINK ABOUT- YOU KNOW

01:27:02.383 --> 01:27:04.185
CONSIDERATIONS FOR MERIT TO THE

01:27:04.252 --> 01:27:06.287
DIFFERENT POLICIES. INCLUDE THE

01:27:06.354 --> 01:27:07.789
COST EFFECTIVENESS IS ALWAYS

01:27:07.855 --> 01:27:09.724
KIND OF- AN IMPORTANT

01:27:09.791 --> 01:27:11.292
CONSIDERATION FOR OUR OFFICE

01:27:11.359 --> 01:27:12.226
AND SOMETHING THAT WE LOOK

01:27:12.293 --> 01:27:15.029
INTO- BUT ALSO- COMPENSATES

01:27:15.096 --> 01:27:16.397
WHICH APARTMENT DISCUSSED ABOUT

01:27:16.464 --> 01:27:18.132
THINGS LIKE ARTICLE POLLUTION

01:27:18.199 --> 01:27:20.234
LOCAL AIR POLLUTION. EQUITY

01:27:20.301 --> 01:27:22.236
CONSIDERATIONS AND DISTRIBUTION

01:27:22.303 --> 01:27:23.771
OF COSTS AND BENEFITS. AND

01:27:23.838 --> 01:27:25.506
FINALLY THE AFFECTS OF THE

01:27:25.573 --> 01:27:27.375
STATE'S POLICIES- BUT HAPPENS

01:27:27.442 --> 01:27:29.811
IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS- AND

01:27:29.877 --> 01:27:31.112
THAT COULD MEAN. THINGS LIKE

01:27:31.179 --> 01:27:32.246
THAT RICH WHICH CALIFORNIA'S

01:27:32.313 --> 01:27:34.015

01:27:36.117 --> 01:27:37.752
COST OF DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES

01:27:37.819 --> 01:27:38.286
THAT CAN GET UP IN OTHER

01:27:38.353 --> 01:27:40.188
JURISDICTIONS. OR WHETHER OR

01:27:40.254 --> 01:27:42.123
NOT IT'S A POLICY IS SERVICES

OTHER JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE

01:27:45.259 --> 01:27:46.894
LOOKING TO ADOPT. MORE

01:27:46.961 --> 01:27:47.829
AMBITIOUS CLIMATE POLICIES AND

01:27:47.895 --> 01:27:49.864
SO- THESE ARE ALL KIND OF

01:27:49.931 --> 01:27:51.065
THINGS TO THINK ABOUT OF COURSE

01:27:51.132 --> 01:27:51.933
I'M THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.267
WHAT WE'VE ACHIEVED SO FAR IN

01:27:53.334 --> 01:27:59.540
TERMS OF POLICIES BUT ALSO.

01:27:59.607 --> 01:28:00.408
CONSIDERATIONS GOING FORWARD.

01:28:00.475 --> 01:28:01.109
SO WITH THAT I WANT JUST

01:28:01.175 --> 01:28:03.411
OUTLINED INTO AN- MY- ON A OF

01:28:03.478 --> 01:28:04.579
THE BY. THAT I'M- MISTER MY

01:28:04.646 --> 01:28:05.780
TIME ON THIS FOR QUESTION ABOUT

01:28:05.847 --> 01:28:07.115
WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE EFFECTS

01:28:07.181 --> 01:28:09.817
OF. OTHER PROGRAMS AND POLICIES

01:28:09.884 --> 01:28:11.819
THAT WE ALREADY HAVE IN PLACE-

01:28:11.886 --> 01:28:13.621
FOR CONTEXT OUR OFFICE DOES

01:28:13.688 --> 01:28:15.890
HAVE AN ANNUAL REPORTING

01:28:15.957 --> 01:28:17.125
REQUIREMENT AND STATUTE RIGHT

01:28:17.191 --> 01:28:19.293
NOW. TO REPORT ANNUALLY ON THE

01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:21.029
ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND COSTS OF

01:28:21.095 --> 01:28:23.097
THE STATE'S. CLIMATE PROGRAMS

01:28:23.164 --> 01:28:25.333
AND SO RICHARD A COUPLE REPORTS

01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:26.901
ONE OF THEM I FOCUSED ON THE

01:28:26.968 --> 01:28:28.302
STATE'S MAJOR TRANSPORTATION

01:28:28.369 --> 01:28:30.438
POLICIES. ANOTHER FOCUS ON

01:28:30.505 --> 01:28:32.540
ELECTRIC ELECTRICITY GENERATION

01:28:32.607 --> 01:28:33.107
SO SOME OF MY COMMENTS ARE

01:28:33.174 --> 01:28:35.109
REALLY BASED ON. FINDING AND

01:28:35.176 --> 01:28:36.878
FINDING THEM THOSE RECORDS. I

01:28:36.944 --> 01:28:38.346
THINK REALLY THE KEY FINDING

01:28:38.413 --> 01:28:40.114
FROM- ONE OF THE KEY FINDINGS

01:28:40.181 --> 01:28:41.816
FROM BOTH OF THOSE REPORTS IS

01:28:41.883 --> 01:28:42.884
THAT WE REALLY DON'T HAVE

01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:44.552
GREAT. PROGRAM ABOUT ASIAN

01:28:44.619 --> 01:28:46.487
INFORMATION- ABOUT KIND OF THE

01:28:46.554 --> 01:28:48.089
OVERALL COSTS AND BENEFITS OF

01:28:48.156 --> 01:28:49.991
SPECIFIC POLICIES AND SPECIFIC

01:28:50.058 --> 01:28:52.560
PROGRAMS- THERE'S A MAKING OF

01:28:52.627 --> 01:28:53.661
LIMITED INFORMATION IN MANY

01:28:53.728 --> 01:28:55.997
CASES- NOW BASED ON THAT

01:28:56.064 --> 01:28:58.199
INFORMATION THAT IS AVAILABLE-

01:28:58.266 --> 01:28:59.467
BUT SOME OF THAT THE FINDINGS

01:28:59.534 --> 01:29:01.202
THAT WE DON'T HAVE OR THAT- YOU

01:29:01.269 --> 01:29:01.769
KNOW THAT THINGS LIKE THE

01:29:01.836 --> 01:29:03.771
RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO. LIKELY HAD

01:29:03.838 --> 01:29:06.274
THE BIGGEST EFFECT ON A MISSION

01:29:06.340 --> 01:29:07.075
REDUCTIONS OF THE LAST SEVERAL

01:29:07.141 --> 01:29:09.944
YEARS. AND A RELATIVELY MODEST

01:29:10.011 --> 01:29:11.946
OR MODERATE COSTS ARE BASED ON

01:29:12.013 --> 01:29:12.547
OUR SOME OF OUR BACK OF THE

01:29:12.613 --> 01:29:14.782
ENVELOPE CALCULATIONS IS ABOUT

01:29:14.849 --> 01:29:16.250
SIXTY TO SEVENTY DOLLARS. PER

01:29:16.317 --> 01:29:17.885
TON WHICH IS NO MORE THAN THAT

01:29:17.952 --> 01:29:18.986
ARE THE PRICE OF A CAP AND

01:29:19.053 --> 01:29:20.755
TRADE ALLOWANCE BUT LESS THAN.

01:29:20.822 --> 01:29:21.656
SOME OF THE OTHER POLICIES

01:29:21.723 --> 01:29:23.991
WHICH- THE AVAILABLE

01:29:24.058 --> 01:29:24.792
INFORMATION SUGGESTS THE COST

01:29:24.859 --> 01:29:26.794
PER TON ARE. YOU KNOW NOT TWO

01:29:26.861 --> 01:29:27.695
HUNDRED DOLLARS PER TIME

01:29:27.762 --> 01:29:29.464
ROUGHLY IN THE CASE OF THE LCS

01:29:29.530 --> 01:29:31.432
US FOR EXAMPLE OR IN THE CASE

01:29:31.499 --> 01:29:32.900
OF SOME OF OUR- INCENTIVE

01:29:32.967 --> 01:29:34.869
PROGRAM THAT'S OVER A- THOUSAND

01:29:34.936 --> 01:29:37.638
DOLLARS PER TIME- AND SO I

01:29:37.705 --> 01:29:38.840
DON'T BUT IN MOST CASES THERE'S

01:29:38.906 --> 01:29:40.408
REALLY LIMITED KIND OF RELIABLE

01:29:40.475 --> 01:29:42.243
INFORMATION ON THE COSTS. AND

01:29:42.310 --> 01:29:42.744
BENEFITS OF SOME OF THE

01:29:42.810 --> 01:29:46.514
DIFFERENT POLICIES- AND SO I

01:29:46.581 --> 01:29:47.949
MEAN I DO IT IN THAT VEIN I

01:29:48.015 --> 01:29:49.183
THINK I DO WANT TO ALSO

01:29:49.250 --> 01:29:51.853
RECOGNIZE THAT. IN MANY CASES.

01:29:51.919 --> 01:29:52.987
IT'S VERY HARD TO KIND OF

01:29:53.054 --> 01:29:54.288
MEASURE THESE THINGS REALLY

01:29:54.355 --> 01:30:01.896
WELL- IT'S NOT JUST A MATTER OF

01:30:01.963 --> 01:30:02.463
COLLECTING DATA AND TRACKING

01:30:02.530 --> 01:30:03.664
EMISSIONS INTERPRET. SO I WE

01:30:03.731 --> 01:30:04.866
WANT TO KNOW EFFECT OF THE

01:30:04.932 --> 01:30:05.800
PARTICULAR POWER. THERE'S A LOT

01:30:05.867 --> 01:30:06.601
OF OTHER. FACTORS CHANGING.

01:30:06.667 --> 01:30:08.136
CONDITIONS CHANGES IN MY PRICE

01:30:08.202 --> 01:30:08.770
THAT MIGHT HAVE OCCURRED

01:30:08.836 --> 01:30:10.505
OTHERWISE FEDERAL AND LOCAL

01:30:10.571 --> 01:30:12.807
POLICIES. AS WELL AS JUST

01:30:12.874 --> 01:30:14.475
OVERLAP BETWEEN KIND OF THE

01:30:14.542 --> 01:30:15.676
DIFFERENT STATE POLICIES THAT

01:30:15.743 --> 01:30:17.678
WE HAVE BEEN SO WONDERFUL THIS

01:30:17.745 --> 01:30:19.647
IS OUR- ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES

01:30:19.714 --> 01:30:22.617
WE HAVE. REGULATION ENCOURAGING

01:30:22.683 --> 01:30:23.217
I'M MORE PRODUCTION OF ZERO

01:30:23.284 --> 01:30:25.453
EMISSION VEHICLES. AS WELL AS

01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:27.054
INCENTIVES TO ENCOURAGE

01:30:27.121 --> 01:30:28.890
CONSUMERS TO PURCHASE VEHICLES

01:30:28.956 --> 01:30:31.292
AN ANSWER AS TO. ENCOURAGE

01:30:31.359 --> 01:30:32.126
ADDITIONAL CHARGING

01:30:32.193 --> 01:30:34.495
INFRASTRUCTURE AND SO- TRYING

01:30:34.562 --> 01:30:35.797
TO THIRTIES OUT. WOULD BE

01:30:35.863 --> 01:30:37.431
AFFECTED AFFECTED NURSING

01:30:37.498 --> 01:30:38.766
AFFECTS ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT

01:30:38.833 --> 01:30:39.967
POLICIES THAT EXTREMELY

01:30:40.034 --> 01:30:42.103
CHALLENGING SO THAT. WE SAY

01:30:42.170 --> 01:30:43.771
THANK ARE ARE RELATED MAIN

01:30:43.838 --> 01:30:44.872
RECOMMENDATION FROM SOME OF

01:30:44.939 --> 01:30:47.175
THESE RECORDS- IF YOU KIND OF

01:30:47.241 --> 01:30:48.776
THE IT'S MY TESTIMONY WITH ONE

01:30:48.843 --> 01:30:49.811
THING I THINK THIS IS REALLY AT

01:30:49.877 --> 01:30:51.279
AS- WE DO RECOMMEND THE

01:30:51.345 --> 01:30:52.113
LEGISLATURE REALLY KIND OF

01:30:52.180 --> 01:30:54.015
THINK ABOUT CONSIDER PROCESS

01:30:54.081 --> 01:30:55.216
FOR GETTING BETTER INFORMATION

01:30:55.283 --> 01:30:57.418
ABOUT PROGRAM AFFECTS. A POLICY

01:30:57.485 --> 01:30:58.586
THAT WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED SO

01:30:58.653 --> 01:31:00.254
FAR. AND THIS COULD INCLUDE

01:31:00.321 --> 01:31:01.856
THINGS LIKE- PLANNING

01:31:01.923 --> 01:31:03.891
BEFOREHAND BEFORE POLICY IS

01:31:03.958 --> 01:31:05.126
IMPLEMENTED A NEW POLICIES

01:31:05.193 --> 01:31:05.860
IMPLEMENTED OR PROGRAM IS

01:31:05.927 --> 01:31:07.695
EXPANDED. ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING

01:31:07.762 --> 01:31:09.697
TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS. AND I

01:31:09.764 --> 01:31:10.965
CAN INCLUDE THINGS LIKE WORKING

01:31:11.032 --> 01:31:12.700
WITH EXPERTS OUR OUTSIDE

01:31:12.767 --> 01:31:14.402
APPETITE ECONOMICS ON WHAT DATA

01:31:14.468 --> 01:31:15.937
WOULD BE NEEDED. YOU KNOW WHAT

01:31:16.003 --> 01:31:17.505
METHODS MIGHT BE USED WHAT ARE

01:31:17.572 --> 01:31:23.578
NOT THERE'S A. FINALLY IT GOOD

01:31:23.644 --> 01:31:25.112
COULD LIKELY MANY CASES REQUIRE

01:31:25.179 --> 01:31:26.581
A LITTLE BIT A BIT MORE FUNDING

01:31:26.647 --> 01:31:27.882
TO. SUPPORT THESE TYPES OF

01:31:27.949 --> 01:31:29.517
EFFORTS BUT IN OUR DELUXE ARE.

01:31:29.584 --> 01:31:30.384
RELATIVELY IT WOULD BE A

01:31:30.451 --> 01:31:31.385
RELATIVELY MODEST AMOUNT

01:31:31.452 --> 01:31:33.621
PROBABLY COMPARED TO JUST THE

01:31:33.688 --> 01:31:34.255
OVERALL SIZE AND SCOPE OF THESE

01:31:34.322 --> 01:31:36.524
PROGRAMS. I REALLY THAT. YOU

01:31:36.591 --> 01:31:38.693
HAVE THAT REASON FOR- IN

01:31:38.759 --> 01:31:40.761
FOCUSING ON EVALUATING PROGRAMS

01:31:40.828 --> 01:31:42.029
WE HAD I THINK ARE ARE KIND OF

01:31:42.096 --> 01:31:43.798
TWO FOLD ONE. JUST YOU KNOW

01:31:43.865 --> 01:31:44.866
HAVING THAT INFORMATION ABOUT

01:31:44.932 --> 01:31:46.400
WHAT'S WORKING AND WHAT'S NOT-

01:31:46.467 --> 01:31:47.501
IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR

01:31:47.568 --> 01:31:48.769
INFORMING LONG TERM POLICY

01:31:48.836 --> 01:31:50.171
DECISIONS IN CALIFORNIA ON THE

01:31:50.238 --> 01:31:51.772
EFFECTS THAT. OCCUR IN

01:31:51.839 --> 01:31:53.808
CALIFORNIA. TRYING TO ADOPT THE

01:31:53.875 --> 01:31:56.310
MOST AFFECTED PROGRAMS. BUT

01:31:56.377 --> 01:31:57.278
ALSO IN THE SPACE AND THE

01:31:57.345 --> 01:31:59.247
CLIMATE CHANGE SPACE. ARE AT

01:31:59.313 --> 01:32:00.248
STAKE I HAVE THE POTENTIALLY

01:32:00.314 --> 01:32:02.083
HELP SERVICE. I'M NOT SORT OF

01:32:02.149 --> 01:32:03.551
DEMONSTRATION ROLE TO THE REST

01:32:03.618 --> 01:32:04.785
OF THE WORLD TO THE DEGREE WE

01:32:04.852 --> 01:32:06.220
HAVE. BETTER INFORMATION ABOUT

01:32:06.287 --> 01:32:07.788
WHAT'S WORKED WHAT WORKS WHAT

01:32:07.855 --> 01:32:09.090
DOESN'T QUITE WORK WHAT TE

01:32:09.156 --> 01:32:10.491
DIFFERENT TRADE OFFS OF ARE

01:32:10.558 --> 01:32:11.025
ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENT

01:32:11.092 --> 01:32:13.060
OPTIONS. I CAN REALLY CAN HELP

01:32:13.127 --> 01:32:14.662
INFORM SOME OF THOSE DECISIONS

01:32:14.729 --> 01:32:15.830
IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS AND

01:32:15.897 --> 01:32:21.302
PERHAPS GOING TO PROMOTE. MORE

01:32:21.369 --> 01:32:23.304
AMBITIOUS ACTION THERE. SO THAT

01:32:23.371 --> 01:32:25.172
WAS MAIN THOSE ARE OF THE MAIN.

01:32:25.239 --> 01:32:26.340
I WANTED TO MAKE A KIND OF TALK

01:32:26.407 --> 01:32:28.242
ON A COUPLE OTHER. ARE OTHER

01:32:28.309 --> 01:32:30.444
ONE I WE ON. TO THE TWENTY

01:32:30.511 --> 01:32:33.080
THIRTY GOAL. ARE B. MOST RECENT

01:32:33.147 --> 01:32:35.816
SCOPING PLAN TWENTY SEVENTEEN-

01:32:35.883 --> 01:32:36.784
RELIES PRETTY HEAVILY ON CAP

01:32:36.851 --> 01:32:38.920
AND TRADE TO MEET THE- TWENTY

01:32:38.986 --> 01:32:40.488
THIRTY GOALS AND IN GENERAL OUR

CARBON PRICING. INCLUDING CAP

01:32:44.725 --> 01:32:46.360
AND TRADE IS REALLY A- A CORE

01:32:46.427 --> 01:32:47.395
STRATEGY FOR ACHIEVING

01:32:47.461 --> 01:32:48.696
REMISSION REDUCTIONS WE DO

01:32:48.763 --> 01:32:50.865
THINK. THERE'S A LOT OF

01:32:50.932 --> 01:32:51.732
EVIDENCE SUGGESTING THAT THE

01:32:51.799 --> 01:32:53.067
MOST COST EFFECTIVE APPROACH TO

01:32:53.134 --> 01:32:56.337
REDUCING EMISSIONS- BUT IT'S

01:32:56.404 --> 01:32:57.772
NOT CLEAR THAT THE PROGRAM HAS

01:32:57.838 --> 01:32:59.173
STRUCTURED TODAY. TODAY IN

01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:01.108
DESIGNS AND IMPLEMENTED TODAY

01:33:01.175 --> 01:33:02.009
IT'S REALLY SET OUT TO

01:33:02.076 --> 01:33:03.577
ACCOMPLISH THE TASK PASCO

01:33:03.644 --> 01:33:05.546
COUNTY. ALLOWING THE STATE TO

ME THAT'S TWENTY THIRTY GOALS

01:33:06.781 --> 01:33:08.049
ARE HAPPY TO KIND OF DISCUSS

01:33:08.115 --> 01:33:09.116
THOSE CAP AND TRADE ISSUES AND

01:33:09.183 --> 01:33:11.986
DESIGN ISSUES. ARE FURTHER- BUT

01:33:12.053 --> 01:33:13.054
IT IT JUST KIND OF WANT TO FLAG

01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:14.355
THAT IS SORT OF ONE OF THE KEY

01:33:14.422 --> 01:33:16.023
KIND OF UP TO DRAW CONCERNED

01:33:16.090 --> 01:33:17.058
AREAS OF CONCERN WE HAVE ABOUT

01:33:17.124 --> 01:33:18.459
WHETHER NOT THE CURRENCY TO

01:33:18.526 --> 01:33:20.127
POLICIES. IS SET UP TO CHEAT

01:33:20.194 --> 01:33:25.599
THE LEGISLATORS. TWENTY THIRTY

01:33:25.666 --> 01:33:27.501
GOALS- FINALLY. OUT WHAT IS.

01:33:27.568 --> 01:33:30.071
ALL FIVE CARBON. BY THEY'RE

01:33:30.137 --> 01:33:30.638
THEY'RE STILL I THINK A LOT

01:33:30.705 --> 01:33:31.806
WORK TO- TO MEET THOSE TWENTY

01:33:31.872 --> 01:33:33.341
THIRD. OUR GOALS THAT WE

01:33:33.407 --> 01:33:34.942
ALREADY HAVE IN STATUTE AND I

01:33:35.009 --> 01:33:36.577
SOME UNCERTAINTY RIGHT NOW

01:33:36.644 --> 01:33:37.345
ABOUT EXACTLY HOW THOSE GOALS

01:33:37.411 --> 01:33:39.480
WILL BE MET- AND OF COURSE

01:33:39.547 --> 01:33:40.514
THERE. WILL BE CAN'T EVEN MORE

01:33:40.581 --> 01:33:42.216
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT. SOME OF THE

01:33:42.283 --> 01:33:42.950
LONGER TERM GOALS AND HOW

01:33:43.017 --> 01:33:45.086
THEY'RE NOT. OUT WE DO THINK

01:33:45.152 --> 01:33:45.886
LONGER TERM GOALS CAN BE

01:33:45.953 --> 01:33:47.655
HELPFUL TO REALLY GUIDE

01:33:47.722 --> 01:33:50.057
PLANNING- AND HELP. OUT FOR

01:33:50.124 --> 01:33:51.759
EXAMPLE- AVOID THINGS LIKE

01:33:51.826 --> 01:33:53.327

SCHOOLS AND- ARABI SORT OF

01:37:22.703 --> 01:37:24.004
CLEAREST WAY TO ADDRESS THAT

01:37:24.071 --> 01:37:26.674
COULD BE SOMETHING LIKE.

01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:27.808

01:38:56.096 --> 01:38:58.165
THE BOTTOM OF THE MARKET. RIGHT

01:38:58.232 --> 01:38:58.999

TRANSPORTATION AS A- AS ONE OF

01:39:20.988 --> 01:39:22.656
THE AREAS OF REDUCING.

01:39:22.723 --> 01:39:25.726

THAT WE'VE COLLECTED- FOR- FROM

01:41:13.767 --> 01:41:14.735
THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM THE

01:41:14.802 --> 01:41:16.570
G. G. R. F. HOW WE SPENT THOSE

01:41:16.637 --> 01:41:19.406
DOLLARS AND THE MOST EFFECTIVE

01:41:19.473 --> 01:41:21.909
WAY TO MAXIMIZE REDUCTIONS IN

01:41:21.975 --> 01:41:25.612
GREENHOUSE GASES. ARE THERE

01:41:25.679 --> 01:41:27.714
OTHER ALTERNATIVES- THAT WE

01:41:27.781 --> 01:41:29.082
SHOULD HAVE DONE AND SHOULD

01:41:29.149 --> 01:41:30.818
LOOK AT THE TOWARD REDUCING

01:41:30.884 --> 01:41:34.388
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. YEAH

01:41:34.455 --> 01:41:35.989
I MEAN I THINK IN TERMS OF JUST

01:41:36.056 --> 01:41:37.157
THE INFORMATION WE HAVE

01:41:37.224 --> 01:41:39.827
AVAILABLE AND THE ABSTINENCE OF

01:41:39.893 --> 01:41:40.994
WHAT EACH PROGRAM IS

01:41:41.061 --> 01:41:42.729
ACCOMPLISHING IN TERMS OF COST

01:41:42.796 --> 01:41:46.300
PER TIME REDUCED- AT LEAST IN

01:41:46.366 --> 01:41:47.768
TERMS OF DIRECT REDUCTIONS I

01:41:47.835 --> 01:41:48.869
THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT

01:41:48.936 --> 01:41:50.304
YOU KNOW WE ARE NOT NECESSARILY

01:41:50.370 --> 01:41:52.906
FOCUSING OUR SPENDING ON. THE

01:41:52.973 --> 01:41:55.742
MOST COST EFFECTIVE- APPROACHES

01:41:55.809 --> 01:41:57.277
I MEAN IF YOU LOOK AT EVEN JUST

01:41:57.344 --> 01:41:58.345
THE REPORTING FROM THE AIR

01:41:58.412 --> 01:42:00.247
RESOURCES BOARD ON A COST PER

01:42:00.314 --> 01:42:03.250
TIME YOU'LL SEE A RANGE FROM

01:42:03.317 --> 01:42:04.218
YOU KNOW ROUGHLY TEN DOLLARS

01:42:04.284 --> 01:42:06.487
PER TIME OUT TO A FEW THOUSAND

01:42:06.553 --> 01:42:09.089
DOLLARS PER TIME- NOW I THINK

01:42:09.156 --> 01:42:10.190
YOU KNOW OUR PERSPECTIVE IS

01:42:10.257 --> 01:42:11.625
THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO KIND OF.

01:42:11.692 --> 01:42:13.026
NOTE THAT YOU KNOW THAT'S KIND

01:42:13.093 --> 01:42:14.528
OF LOOKING AT IT FROM A TERROR

01:42:14.595 --> 01:42:16.330
SORT OF DIRECT CARBON EMISSION

01:42:16.396 --> 01:42:18.465
REDUCTIONS AND THAT'S OBVIOUSLY

01:42:18.532 --> 01:42:19.700
IMPORTANT I THINK A LOT OF

01:42:19.766 --> 01:42:20.934
OTHER CONSIDERATIONS GO INTO

01:42:21.001 --> 01:42:22.803
SPENDING DECISIONS OF COURSE AS

01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:25.038
YOU KNOW- AROUND KIND OF OTHER

01:42:25.105 --> 01:42:26.507
TYPES OF COAL POLLUTANTS AND CO

01:42:26.573 --> 01:42:28.108
BENEFITS THAT MIGHT SORT OF

01:42:28.175 --> 01:42:28.609
PLAY INTO SOME OF THOSE

01:42:28.675 --> 01:42:31.345
CONSIDERATIONS- I THINK ANOTHER

01:42:31.411 --> 01:42:33.280
BIG PIECE. IS THE SORT OF

01:42:33.347 --> 01:42:34.882
TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT AND

01:42:34.948 --> 01:42:36.283
QUESTION A LOT OF THE PROGRAMS

01:42:36.350 --> 01:42:38.252
WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON PILOTS AND

01:42:38.318 --> 01:42:40.821
DEMONSTRATIONS ARE WITH KIND OF

01:42:40.888 --> 01:42:42.256
THE IDEA THAT THERE WILL BE A

01:42:42.322 --> 01:42:43.123
LONG TERM BENEFITS ASSOCIATED

01:42:43.190 --> 01:42:45.626
WITH. PROMOTING A- KIND OF

01:42:45.692 --> 01:42:47.461
NEWER TECHNOLOGY AND SO THOSE

01:42:47.528 --> 01:42:48.362
ARE THOSE ARE BENEFITS THAT ARE

01:42:48.428 --> 01:42:49.496
A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT TO

01:42:49.563 --> 01:42:50.430
QUANTIFY AND DON'T REALLY SHOW

01:42:50.497 --> 01:42:52.032
UP IN SOME OF THOSE JUST CARE

01:42:52.099 --> 01:42:54.001
COST PER TIME CONSIDERATIONS

01:42:54.067 --> 01:42:55.302
BUT WE ARE WE DO WE DO THINK

01:42:55.369 --> 01:42:56.737
THAT'S KIND OF ONE IMPORTANT

01:42:56.803 --> 01:42:58.272
THING TO THINK ABOUT AS WELL.

01:42:58.338 --> 01:42:59.506
RIGHT RIGHT AND DID YOU THINK

01:42:59.573 --> 01:43:00.707
IT BE DIFFERENT IF THERE ARE

01:43:00.774 --> 01:43:02.643
SOME OTHER MECHANISM OF REVENUE

01:43:02.709 --> 01:43:04.411
LIKE A CARBON TAX THAT THERE'S

01:43:04.478 --> 01:43:05.812
A DIRECT CARBON TAX DO YOU

01:43:05.879 --> 01:43:07.748
THINK THAT WE WOULD BE BETTER-

01:43:07.814 --> 01:43:08.916
WITH COLLECTING THAT REVENUE

01:43:08.982 --> 01:43:14.588
AND SPENDING. IT TOWARD

01:43:14.655 --> 01:43:15.088
REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS

01:43:15.155 --> 01:43:15.689
EMISSIONS. THAT'S SOMETHING I

01:43:15.756 --> 01:43:18.025
CAN'T- I CAN'T REALLY SAY I

01:43:18.091 --> 01:43:20.127
MEAN THOSE- APPROPRIATION

01:43:20.193 --> 01:43:21.828
DECISIONS ARE ARE UP TO THE

01:43:21.895 --> 01:43:24.031
LEGISLATURE- AND MEMBERS OF THE

01:43:24.097 --> 01:43:25.465
LEGISLATURE. SO I CAN'T SAY

01:43:25.532 --> 01:43:27.534
SORT OF HOW ON A SPENDING WITH

01:43:27.601 --> 01:43:29.202
THIS. CHANGE AT ALL IF THEY

01:43:29.269 --> 01:43:30.837
WERE JUST A DIFFERENT KIND OF

01:43:30.904 --> 01:43:32.472
MECHANISM FOR COLLECTING. FOR

01:43:32.539 --> 01:43:34.408
COLLECTING THE REVENUE I WHAT I

01:43:34.474 --> 01:43:35.342
CAN SAY ON THE REVENUE SIDE AS

01:43:35.409 --> 01:43:37.578
THE- YOU KNOW THERE ARE

01:43:37.644 --> 01:43:39.379
ALTERNATIVE OPPORTUNITIES

01:43:39.446 --> 01:43:42.215
ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES- LIKE A

01:43:42.282 --> 01:43:43.884
CARBON TAX- THEY DO HAVE

01:43:43.951 --> 01:43:44.851
DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS IN

01:43:44.918 --> 01:43:46.219
TERMS OF THE VOLATILITY OF THE

01:43:46.286 --> 01:43:48.121
REVENUE SO THERE'S- POTENTIALLY

01:43:48.188 --> 01:43:49.323
WAYS TO KIND OF STRUCTURE THOSE

01:43:49.389 --> 01:43:51.158
THAT- REDUCE SOME OF THE

01:43:51.224 --> 01:43:52.326
REVENUE VOLATILITY THAT WE'VE

01:43:52.392 --> 01:43:54.361
SEEN IN PAST YEARS SO- I THINK

01:43:54.428 --> 01:43:55.329
A LOT OF A DIFFERENT SORT OF

01:43:55.395 --> 01:43:57.164
SHOW UP ON THAT SIDE OF THINGS-

01:43:57.230 --> 01:43:58.465
BETTER KIND OF DECISIONS ABOUT

01:43:58.532 --> 01:43:59.900
HOW THE MONEY IS ALLOCATED.

01:43:59.967 --> 01:44:01.535
REALLY SORT OF DEPENDS ON

01:44:01.602 --> 01:44:02.069
LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES AND

01:44:02.135 --> 01:44:06.273
ALLOCATIONS. OKAY THANK YOU.

01:44:06.340 --> 01:44:09.009
ASSEMBLY WOMAN- BURKE. SO MIKE

01:44:09.076 --> 01:44:12.012
A GROUP BECAUSE BY TO THIS.

01:44:12.079 --> 01:44:12.813
COMING ABOUT THOSE WHO TRY

01:44:12.879 --> 01:44:15.582
FURTHER- AND A CARBON TAX AND

01:44:15.649 --> 01:44:17.150
THE COST AFFECTS I WAS

01:44:17.217 --> 01:44:18.285
WONDERING WHEN YOU LOOK AT

01:44:18.352 --> 01:44:19.620
THOSE THINGS ESPECIALLY FOR

01:44:19.686 --> 01:44:20.754
PEOPLE OF MY DISTRICT THEY

01:44:20.821 --> 01:44:22.589
DRIVE FURTHER BECAUSE- THEY

01:44:22.656 --> 01:44:24.191
CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE. WHERE

01:44:24.257 --> 01:44:26.827
THEY WORK- ARE THOSE EQUITY

01:44:26.893 --> 01:44:28.328
CONVERSATIONS GOING TO BE

01:44:28.395 --> 01:44:29.796
INCLUDED IN ANY REPORT YOU'RE

01:44:29.863 --> 01:44:30.998
DOING ARE ARE THEY INCLUDED IN

01:44:31.064 --> 01:44:33.000
THOSE CONVERSATIONS- AND

01:44:33.066 --> 01:44:36.036
REPORTS AS YOU'RE HAVING THEM-

01:44:36.103 --> 01:44:37.804
DIRECT EFFECT WE DON'T HAVE

01:44:37.871 --> 01:44:38.338
ELECTRIC VEHICLES IN OUR

01:44:38.405 --> 01:44:39.640
DISTRICT BECAUSE WE CAN'T.

01:44:39.706 --> 01:44:41.375
AFFORD THEM NOR DO OUR HOUSING

01:44:41.441 --> 01:44:43.844
STRUCTURES ALLOW- HAVE THE

01:44:43.910 --> 01:44:45.779
FLEXIBILITY OR THE ABILITY TO

01:44:45.846 --> 01:44:47.714
HAVE THEM SELL- I'M JUST

01:44:47.781 --> 01:44:50.283
WONDERING WHERE EQUITY FALLS IN

01:44:50.350 --> 01:44:52.686
THAT CONVERSATION. YEAH I MEAN

01:44:52.753 --> 01:44:53.654
IT THREE EQUITIES

01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:56.490
CONSIDERATIONS- AND ARGUE

01:44:56.556 --> 01:44:57.424
SHOULD ABSOLUTELY BE PART OF

01:44:57.491 --> 01:45:00.160
THE- CONVERSATION- AND I THINK

01:45:00.227 --> 01:45:01.795
THAT'S PART OF WHAT SORT OF

01:45:01.862 --> 01:45:03.697
MAKES A LOT OF THE DECISIONS SO

01:45:03.764 --> 01:45:05.899
DIFFICULT AND ONE. POLICY

01:45:05.966 --> 01:45:08.769
MIGHT- MIGHT WORK WELL I'M KIND

01:45:08.835 --> 01:45:11.805
OF ONE METRIC WHETHER IT COST-EFFECTIVENESS- AND MAYBE NOT AS

01:45:11.872 --> 01:45:16.009
WELL ON SOME OTHER METRIC- LIKE

01:45:16.076 --> 01:45:16.743
EQUITY I MEAN I THINK IN THE

01:45:16.810 --> 01:45:18.812
CASE OF. A CAP AND TRADE OR A

01:45:18.879 --> 01:45:19.680
CARBON PRICING IN GENERAL

01:45:19.746 --> 01:45:21.915
THERE'S- IT HAS THE BENEFIT OF

01:45:21.982 --> 01:45:24.084
HAVING A LOT OF OPTIONS FOR

01:45:24.151 --> 01:45:25.419
TRYING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE%

01:45:25.485 --> 01:45:27.120
EQUITY CONSIDERATIONS THE FACT

01:45:27.187 --> 01:45:28.288
THAT. THE STATE DOES COLLECT

01:45:28.355 --> 01:45:29.690
REVENUE AS A RESULT IN CAN USE

01:45:29.756 --> 01:45:31.558
THAT REVENUE IN A WAY THAT. IS

01:45:31.625 --> 01:45:33.160
TARGETED TO OFFSET

01:45:33.226 --> 01:45:34.961
SOME OF THOSE EFFECTS- IS SORT

01:45:35.028 --> 01:45:36.596
OF A BENEFIT OF CARBON PRICING

01:45:36.663 --> 01:45:38.365
IN GENERAL BUT I THINK OVERALL.

01:45:38.432 --> 01:45:39.666
WE THINK ABOUT THE DIFFERENT

01:45:39.733 --> 01:45:41.268
POLICY OPTIONS WE HAVE THINKING

01:45:41.334 --> 01:45:42.369
ABOUT NOT JUST COST

01:45:42.436 --> 01:45:43.804
EFFECTIVENESS BUT HOW THOSE

01:45:43.870 --> 01:45:44.604
COSTS AND BENEFITS ARE

01:45:44.671 --> 01:45:46.273
DISTRIBUTED IS REALLY.

01:45:46.339 --> 01:45:47.441
IMPORTANT PART OF THE

01:45:47.507 --> 01:45:48.275
CONVERSATION OF SOMETHING THAT

01:45:48.341 --> 01:45:51.611
WE- WILL CONTINUE TO TRY TO-

01:45:51.678 --> 01:45:53.814
CONSIDER AND ACTIVISTS ACTORS

01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:54.815
GET INFORMATION KIND OF

01:45:54.881 --> 01:45:56.283
HIGHLIGHT I WAS SORT OF ONE OF

01:45:56.349 --> 01:46:00.987
THE TRADE ALSO CONSIDERATIONS.

01:46:01.054 --> 01:46:01.488
AND THE DIFFERENT POLICY

01:46:01.555 --> 01:46:05.992
OPTIONS WE HAVE. THANK YOU. FOR

01:46:06.059 --> 01:46:08.628
I GUESS I'D LIKE TO- RUN OUT

01:46:08.695 --> 01:46:10.130
OUR- REQUEST FOR YOU MISTER

01:46:10.197 --> 01:46:13.166
BROWN WITH THE- YOU BRING IT

01:46:13.233 --> 01:46:15.936
BACK TO. ONE OF MY MAIN

01:46:16.002 --> 01:46:17.738
QUESTIONS- GLENN ONE OF MY MAIN

01:46:17.804 --> 01:46:19.139
GOALS FOR THIS HEARING TODAY IS

01:46:19.206 --> 01:46:23.143
TO TRY TO GET. YOU KNOW. AS

01:46:23.210 --> 01:46:25.178
CLOSER DEFINITIVE ANSWER IN IN

01:46:25.245 --> 01:46:26.747
IN TERMS OF WHETHER WE'RE ON

01:46:26.813 --> 01:46:28.048
TRACK TO MEET OUR TWENTY THIRTY

01:46:28.115 --> 01:46:31.752
GOAL- I HEARD YOU SAY THAT. THE

01:46:31.818 --> 01:46:32.519
TWENTY THIRTY GOAL IS MUCH MORE

01:46:32.586 --> 01:46:34.521
AMBITIOUS I HEARD YOU SAY THAT

01:46:34.588 --> 01:46:38.024
THE TWENTY THIRTY- SCOPING PLAN

01:46:38.091 --> 01:46:39.826
THE LAST CUP INCLINED- THE PLAN

01:46:39.893 --> 01:46:42.596
RELIES HEAVILY. ON CAP AND

01:46:42.662 --> 01:46:47.033
TRADE THAT WHILE- IT IT- IS

01:46:47.100 --> 01:46:47.801
APPEARS TO BE THE MOST COST

01:46:47.868 --> 01:46:50.437
EFFECTIVE THAT IT'S- WHAT I

01:46:50.504 --> 01:46:52.005
HEARD YOU SAYING WAS ADDED

01:46:52.072 --> 01:46:53.640
RAISES CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER

01:46:53.707 --> 01:46:56.009
WE ARE IN FACT ON TRACK TO

01:46:56.076 --> 01:47:00.147
MEETING OR TWENTY THIRTY GOAL.

01:47:00.213 --> 01:47:04.317
YEAH I MEAN I THINK- BASED ON

01:47:04.384 --> 01:47:05.952
KIND OF THE INFORMATION WE HAVE

01:47:06.019 --> 01:47:07.420
NOW IN THE PLAN THAT THE STATE

01:47:07.487 --> 01:47:09.556
ADOPTED SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND

01:47:09.623 --> 01:47:11.658
WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT- THE ROLE

01:47:11.725 --> 01:47:13.927
CAP AND TRADE PLAYED AND SO

01:47:13.994 --> 01:47:15.896
KIND OF HOW IT'S ACTUALLY-

01:47:15.962 --> 01:47:17.497
DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED RIGHT

01:47:17.564 --> 01:47:19.633
NOW I THINK WE HAVE WE DON'T I

01:47:19.699 --> 01:47:21.234
FRANKLY HAVE A LOT OF

01:47:21.301 --> 01:47:21.802
CONFIDENCE THAT KIND OF THE

01:47:21.868 --> 01:47:24.504
CURRENT- POLICY FRAMEWORK AND

01:47:24.571 --> 01:47:25.572
KIND OF SET OF POLICIES AND

01:47:25.639 --> 01:47:27.941
DESIGN OF POLICIES IT'S GONNA-

01:47:28.008 --> 01:47:30.210
IS GONNA HELP US MEET THAT

01:47:30.277 --> 01:47:30.811
TWENTY THIRTY BALK NOW THERE'S

01:47:30.877 --> 01:47:32.979
A LOT OF. A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY

01:47:33.046 --> 01:47:34.881
OF COURSE BETWEEN NOW AND

01:47:34.948 --> 01:47:35.482
TWENTY THIRTY THERE ARE A LOT

01:47:35.549 --> 01:47:37.417
OF THINGS THAT COULD CHANGE-

01:47:37.484 --> 01:47:38.451
EVEN OUTSIDE OF SORT OF THE

01:47:38.518 --> 01:47:40.086
STATE POLICY WORLD LIKE

01:47:40.153 --> 01:47:42.155
CHANGING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WE

01:47:42.222 --> 01:47:43.557
OBVIOUSLY ARE STILL NOT A

01:47:43.623 --> 01:47:44.891
PANDEMIC WHICH AS YOU KNOW HUGE

01:47:44.958 --> 01:47:46.660
EFFECTS THERE COULD BE CHANGES

01:47:46.726 --> 01:47:48.228
IN FEDERAL POLICY THAT HAVE. A

01:47:48.295 --> 01:47:50.263
SIGNIFICANT AFFECTS ON ON STATE

01:47:50.330 --> 01:47:51.398
EMISSIONS AND SO ALL THOSE

01:47:51.464 --> 01:47:53.733
THINGS- YOU KNOW COULD SORT OF

01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:55.035

GOING FORWARD OUT OF TWENTY

01:47:56.803 --> 01:47:58.305
THIRTY BUT AS FAR AS- WHERE WE

01:47:58.371 --> 01:48:00.574
SIT NOW AND WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT

01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:01.975
KIND BUT IT'S NOT A PLAN THAT

01:48:02.042 --> 01:48:06.746
WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. WE DON'T

01:48:06.813 --> 01:48:07.347
HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE THAT

01:48:07.414 --> 01:48:08.748
WERE. OUR CURRENT SORT OF. IS

01:48:08.815 --> 01:48:09.616
GOING TO HELP US MEET THOSE.

01:48:09.683 --> 01:48:11.218
ARE I THINK WE DON'T. A LOT OF

01:48:11.284 --> 01:48:13.687
FOLKS THAT- THAT THEY- NEW

01:48:13.753 --> 01:48:15.455
MODELING DONE BY A RP. THAT'S

01:48:15.522 --> 01:48:17.324
OF ITS TWENTY SCOPING PLAN WILL

01:48:17.390 --> 01:48:19.492
REALLY- HELP ANSWER THIS

01:48:19.559 --> 01:48:20.961
QUESTION OF RIGHT A LITTLE BIT

01:48:21.027 --> 01:48:22.929
MORE INSIGHTS INTO. WHERE WE

01:48:22.996 --> 01:48:24.731
ARE RIGHT NOW- GIVEN THAT THE

01:48:24.798 --> 01:48:25.265
LAST GOVERNMENT PLAN WAS

01:48:25.332 --> 01:48:27.133
SEVERAL YEARS AGO. IN TERMS OF

01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:28.201
WHAT OUR CURRENT POLICY

01:48:28.268 --> 01:48:29.669
SCENARIO IS AND WHAT WE SORT OF

01:48:29.736 --> 01:48:31.738
INVASION. OUR CURRENT POLICIES

01:48:31.805 --> 01:48:33.573
ARE GOING TO ACHIEVE AND THEN-

01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:34.708
AND THEN HELP SPREAD THIS

01:48:34.774 --> 01:48:35.909
CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT IF

01:48:35.976 --> 01:48:37.444
ANYTHING- IN TERMS OF

01:48:37.510 --> 01:48:40.447
ADDITIONAL POLICIES ARE NEEDED

01:48:40.513 --> 01:48:41.181
TO MEET UP TWENTY THIRTY GOAL.

01:48:41.248 --> 01:48:46.219
SO YOU WITH YOUR. CONCERN ABOUT

01:48:46.286 --> 01:48:49.422
WHETHER. ARE YOUR YOUR YOUR

01:48:49.489 --> 01:48:51.992
LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE AND WHETHER

01:48:52.058 --> 01:48:53.260
WE ARE ON TRACK TO MEETING OUR

01:48:53.326 --> 01:48:56.963
TWENTY THIRTY GOAL- I KNOW THAT

01:48:57.030 --> 01:49:00.467
FOR EXAMPLE ASSEMBLY BILL ON

01:49:00.533 --> 01:49:01.835
ONE NINETY SEVEN. REQUIRED DATE

01:49:01.902 --> 01:49:03.703
THE A R. B. TO PRIORITIZE

01:49:03.770 --> 01:49:10.577
DIRECT EMISSION REDUCTIONS- AND

01:49:10.644 --> 01:49:12.812
YET- THE AND THE TWENTY

01:49:12.879 --> 01:49:14.714
SEVENTEEN SCOPING PLAN- HAS

01:49:14.781 --> 01:49:17.384
INCREASED IN THE- BED THE

01:49:17.450 --> 01:49:19.853
EXPECTED ROLE OF REDUCTIONS TO

01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:22.422
NEARLY HALF OF ALL REQUIRED-

01:49:22.489 --> 01:49:24.591
THROUGH CAP AND TRADE- SHOULD

01:49:24.658 --> 01:49:28.561
WE BE. PASSING POLICIES THAT

01:49:28.628 --> 01:49:30.263
PLACE GREATER EMPHASIS ON

01:49:30.330 --> 01:49:32.132
PRIORITIZING DIRECT EMISSION

01:49:32.198 --> 01:49:36.903
REDUCTIONS OVER CAP AND TRADE.

01:49:36.970 --> 01:49:38.605
I THINK THE ANSWER THAT COMIC

01:49:38.672 --> 01:49:40.473
COMES DOWN TO SOMEBODY'S THE

01:49:40.540 --> 01:49:41.541
QUESTIONS WE'VE ALREADY BEEN

01:49:41.608 --> 01:49:43.643
DISCUSSING AROUND- YOU KNOW HOW

01:49:43.710 --> 01:49:47.047
THE LEGISLATURE PRIORITIZES-

01:49:47.113 --> 01:49:48.748
DIFFERENT CRITERIA ON HONEST

01:49:48.815 --> 01:49:50.684
POLICIES ON TERMS OF COST

01:49:50.750 --> 01:49:53.086
EFFECTIVENESS THINK AGAIN KIND

01:49:53.153 --> 01:49:54.955
OF YOU KNOW CONCENTRATE OR SOME

01:49:55.021 --> 01:49:56.589
SORT OF CARBON PRICING POLICY.

01:49:56.656 --> 01:49:58.024
IF THAT'S YOUR OVER PRIMARY

01:49:58.091 --> 01:50:00.260
METRIC FOR ACHIEVING THOSE

01:50:00.327 --> 01:50:01.928
GOALS WE THINK KIND OF ANGEL

01:50:01.995 --> 01:50:03.396
CHANGES THEY ARE FOCUSING ON

01:50:03.463 --> 01:50:04.264
MAKING SURE THAT THAT THE

01:50:04.331 --> 01:50:05.732
PRICING POLICIES ARE CONSISTENT

01:50:05.799 --> 01:50:07.133
WITH THE STATE'S GOALS THAT IS

01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:07.834
REALLY WHERE YOU SHOULD FOCUS

01:50:07.901 --> 01:50:09.736
YOUR EFFORTS. I'M NOT

01:50:09.803 --> 01:50:11.104
NECESSARILY KIND OF OTHER-

01:50:11.171 --> 01:50:12.706
DIRECT EMISSION REDUCTION

01:50:12.772 --> 01:50:14.341
POLICIES HOWEVER THERE ARE

01:50:14.407 --> 01:50:18.678
pCONSIDERATIONS- AROUNDS- YOU

01:50:18.745 --> 01:50:19.879
KNOW- DEVELOPING NEWER

01:50:19.946 --> 01:50:22.549
TECHNOLOGIES OR- OTHER CO

01:50:22.615 --> 01:50:24.651
POLLUTANT ISSUES THAT THERE ARE

01:50:24.718 --> 01:50:25.452
ARE JUST KIND OF THERE'S A

01:50:25.518 --> 01:50:26.853
PROFIT OTHER POLICIES WILL

01:50:26.920 --> 01:50:28.855
REDUCE COPELAND'S MORE THAN CAP

01:50:28.922 --> 01:50:30.623
AND TRADE FOR EXAMPLE. AND THAT

01:50:30.690 --> 01:50:32.025
COULD BE A CONSIDERATION ONE OF

01:50:32.092 --> 01:50:33.526
THE THINGS THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:50:33.593 --> 01:50:35.829
WAYS THOSE OF THE OTHER THINGS-

01:50:35.895 --> 01:50:37.630
I BELIEVE AND- THERE CAN

01:50:37.697 --> 01:50:42.535
CERTAINLY BE AN ARGUMENT. FOR

01:50:42.602 --> 01:50:43.169
FOCUSING ON SOME OF THOSE OTHER

01:50:43.236 --> 01:50:43.837
POLICIES. IF OUR PRIMARY IF THE-

01:50:43.903 --> 01:50:48.108
PRIMER. IS TO TUNE IN MATE V.

01:50:48.174 --> 01:50:52.979
STATUTORY- GOAL OF- SB THIRTY

01:50:53.046 --> 01:50:55.915
TWO THAT THE TWENTY THIRTY GOAL.

01:50:55.982 --> 01:50:56.516
SHOULD A GREATER EMPHASIS BE

01:50:56.583 --> 01:50:58.118
PLACED ON DIRECT EMISSION

01:50:58.184 --> 01:51:03.723
REDUCTIONS. I THINK NOT

01:51:03.790 --> 01:51:05.725
NECESSARILY AND I THINK- I

01:51:05.792 --> 01:51:07.460
THINK YOU YOU HAVE THE OPTION

01:51:07.527 --> 01:51:09.362
OF LOOKING AT DIRECT EMISSION

01:51:09.429 --> 01:51:11.731
REDUCTIN POLICIES OR CARBON

01:51:11.798 --> 01:51:12.866
PRICING IN CAP AND TRADE AND I

01:51:12.932 --> 01:51:15.568
THINK- IF IT'S IF IT'S STRICTLY

01:51:15.635 --> 01:51:17.337
ON KIND OF A- COST

01:51:17.404 --> 01:51:17.971
EFFECTIVENESS CARBON

01:51:18.038 --> 01:51:21.174
REDUCTIONS. OUT WE THINK KIND

01:51:21.241 --> 01:51:23.043
OF FOCUSING ON- MODIFYING THE

01:51:23.109 --> 01:51:24.644
CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM TO KIND

01:51:24.711 --> 01:51:26.379
OF PROVIDE GREATER INCENTIVES

01:51:26.446 --> 01:51:27.781
FOR THAT PROGRAM IT'S REALLY

01:51:27.847 --> 01:51:30.717
SORT OF THE WAY TO GO- WELL I

01:51:30.784 --> 01:51:32.085
THINK IT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO

01:51:32.152 --> 01:51:33.620
NOTE THAT THAT THAT REALLY

01:51:33.686 --> 01:51:35.055
MEANS EFFECTIVELY THAT YOU WERE

01:51:35.121 --> 01:51:36.423
HAVING. QUITE A BIT HIGHER

01:51:36.489 --> 01:51:38.191
CARBON PRICES LIKELY AND SO YOU

01:51:38.258 --> 01:51:39.259
KNOW THERE ARE THINGS THAT YOU

01:51:39.325 --> 01:51:39.726
NEED TO THINK THROUGH

01:51:39.793 --> 01:51:41.761
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT BUT- I

01:51:41.828 --> 01:51:43.730
DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARILY I

01:51:43.797 --> 01:51:44.497
HAVE THAT DIRECT EMISSION

01:51:44.564 --> 01:51:47.934
REDUCTIONS- ARE ARE NEEDED- OR

01:51:48.001 --> 01:51:49.569
KIND OF A- NON CAP AND TRADE

01:51:49.636 --> 01:51:50.737
RELATED POLICIES ARE

01:51:50.804 --> 01:51:52.305
NECESSARILY NEEDED TO MEET THE

01:51:52.372 --> 01:51:52.872
TWENTY THIRTY BILLS THERE'S

01:51:52.939 --> 01:51:54.240
ALSO THE OPTION OF. A CHANGES

01:51:54.307 --> 01:51:55.675
TO THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM.

01:51:55.742 --> 01:51:59.345
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH

GONNA TOUCH ON A COUPLE OF

01:52:30.543 --> 01:52:32.445
ISSUES FOR THE AGENDA RELATED

01:52:32.512 --> 01:52:33.847
TO CARBON REMOVAL AND THE

01:52:33.913 --> 01:52:34.781

THOSE MATTERS I WANT TO AFFIRM

01:52:39.552 --> 01:52:41.488
EVERYTHING I HEARD FROM DOCTOR

01:52:41.554 --> 01:52:42.288
BROWN- IN THE PREVIOUS

01:52:42.355 --> 01:52:45.692
DISCUSSION- THE FACT THAT. I

01:52:45.758 --> 01:52:48.194
THINK LET ME ACTUALLY EMPHASIZE

01:52:48.261 --> 01:52:49.129
WHAT HE SAID AND GO A STEP

01:52:49.195 --> 01:52:50.630
FURTHER IN IN MY PROFESSIONAL

01:52:50.697 --> 01:52:51.764
OPINION I'M VERY CONFIDENT WE

01:52:51.831 --> 01:52:53.399
ARE NOT ON TRACK TO THE TWENTY

01:52:53.466 --> 01:52:54.267
THIRTY TARGET THEM YOU NEED TO

01:52:54.334 --> 01:52:55.735
MAKE SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN

01:52:55.802 --> 01:52:57.403
OUR POLICY AMBITION TO BRING

01:52:57.470 --> 01:52:58.538
THAT ONLINE I THINK THAT'S

01:52:58.605 --> 01:53:00.173
ENTIRELY TECHNICALLY FEASIBLE

01:53:00.240 --> 01:53:01.374
IT ON THE COULD ANY CONCERNS

01:53:01.441 --> 01:53:02.909
ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO DO THAT AT

01:53:02.976 --> 01:53:04.344
THE CURRENT PACE OF PROGRESS

01:53:04.410 --> 01:53:05.645
IT'S NOT IN LINE WITH WHERE WE

01:53:05.712 --> 01:53:07.380
NEED TO GO. WE HAD A VERY GOOD

01:53:07.447 --> 01:53:09.549
YEAR IN THE EMISSION REDUCTIONS

01:53:09.616 --> 01:53:12.285

01:53:17.056 --> 01:53:19.092
NEED TO ABOUT DOUBLE THAT RATE-

01:53:19.159 --> 01:53:20.193
INSISTING THAT RATE EVERY

THIRTY TO GET THAT JOB DONE IF

01:53:37.644 --> 01:53:38.545
YOU LOOK AT THE CUMULATIVE

01:53:38.611 --> 01:53:40.246

OF A CUMULATIVE PRODUCTIONS- I

01:53:48.188 --> 01:53:49.088
DON'T THINK WE'RE ON TRACK FOR

01:53:49.155 --> 01:53:51.558
THAT AND AS DR BROWN TOLD YOU.

01:53:51.624 --> 01:53:52.859
ALMOST ALL OF THE REDUCTIONS WE

01:53:52.926 --> 01:53:54.194
OBSERVE TODAY HAVE BEEN IN THE

01:53:54.260 --> 01:53:55.662
LECTURES THE SECTOR WHERE OTHER

01:53:55.728 --> 01:53:57.497
REGULATORY AGENCIES AND

01:53:57.564 --> 01:53:59.866
TECHNOLOGY CHANGES PLAYED A

01:53:59.933 --> 01:54:00.700
SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN DRIVING

01:54:00.767 --> 01:54:02.335
THOSE OUTCOMES WE CANNOT RELY

01:54:02.402 --> 01:54:03.603
ON THOSE OUTCOMES AND OUR

01:54:03.670 --> 01:54:05.538
CONTINUED POLICY GOALS TO

01:54:05.605 --> 01:54:06.673
DECARBONIZE THE ELECTRICITY

01:54:06.739 --> 01:54:08.608
GRID TO GET TO TWENTY THIRTY

01:54:08.675 --> 01:54:14.080
LET ALONE. DEEPER TARGETS

01:54:14.147 --> 01:54:14.681
AROUND CARBON NEUTRALITY. WITH

01:54:14.747 --> 01:54:16.482
THAT- PRACTICE OF THE WAY I

01:54:16.549 --> 01:54:17.050
WANTED TO A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

01:54:17.116 --> 01:54:17.951
CARBON NEUTRALITY AND CONCEPT

01:54:18.017 --> 01:54:20.820
OF CARBON NEUTRALITY- AND IT'S-

01:54:20.887 --> 01:54:21.554
TO BE HONEST IT'S VERY

01:54:21.621 --> 01:54:22.956
DIFFICULT TO TALK ABOUT THIS

01:54:23.022 --> 01:54:25.225
BECAUSE IT INVOLVES. OFTEN A

01:54:25.291 --> 01:54:26.659
LOT OF MAGICAL THINKING AND

01:54:26.726 --> 01:54:28.561
MAGICAL THINKING AROUND ISSUES

01:54:28.628 --> 01:54:29.896
THAT I THINK ARE HURTING.

01:54:29.963 --> 01:54:31.497
PEOPLE RIGHT NOW AND I JUST

01:54:31.564 --> 01:54:32.532
WANT TO TAKE NOTE OF THE FACT

01:54:32.599 --> 01:54:34.434
THAT. YOU KNOW. PEOPLE JUST

01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:35.435
EAST OF WHERE YOU ARE IN

01:54:35.501 --> 01:54:36.769
ELDORADO COUNTY HER BY PULLING

01:54:36.836 --> 01:54:38.037
FROM THEIR HOMES IS A MASSIVE

01:54:38.104 --> 01:54:39.072
WILDFIRE HAS ERUPTED YET

01:54:39.138 --> 01:54:41.040
ANOTHER. AND WE'RE HEADED INTO

01:54:41.107 --> 01:54:44.110
RED FLAG CONDITIONS- THIS IS A

01:54:44.177 --> 01:54:46.045
HUGE DEAL FOR. COMMUNITIES THAT

01:54:46.112 --> 01:54:47.447
ARE IMPACTED BY FAR IT'S A HUGE

01:54:47.513 --> 01:54:49.115
DEAL I'M PREPARING TO ROLL OUT

01:54:49.182 --> 01:54:50.516
MY AIR PURIFIERS BECAUSE THE

01:54:50.583 --> 01:54:51.784
ENTIRETY OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

01:54:51.851 --> 01:54:53.453
IS ABOUT TO BE INUNDATED WITH

01:54:53.519 --> 01:54:54.420
PARTICULAR MATTER AS THE WIND

01:54:54.487 --> 01:54:57.757
SHIFTS- THIS IS A LIFE. RIGHT

01:54:57.824 --> 01:55:00.893
NOW. AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND

01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:02.262
TO THINK ABOUT TO GET TO CARBON

01:55:02.328 --> 01:55:04.297
NEUTRALITY WHICH IS HOW WE STOP

01:55:04.364 --> 01:55:05.665
ADDING PRESSURE TO MAKE THE

01:55:05.732 --> 01:55:07.734
CLIMATE PROBLEM WORSE. INVOLVES

01:55:07.800 --> 01:55:09.902
A LOT OF HARD WORK. AND OFTEN

01:55:09.969 --> 01:55:11.371
INVOLVES PEOPLE MAKING HER

01:55:11.437 --> 01:55:12.772
WROTE AND I'M JUSTIFIABLE

01:55:12.839 --> 01:55:14.440
ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT HOW WE'RE

01:55:14.507 --> 01:55:18.044
GOING TO GET THE JOB DONE.

01:55:18.111 --> 01:55:18.645
PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO

01:55:18.711 --> 01:55:19.679
CARBON REMOVAL- I SAID THIS IS

01:55:19.746 --> 01:55:20.613
SOMEBODY THINKS. REMOVED IS

01:55:20.680 --> 01:55:22.215
GOING TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT.

01:55:22.282 --> 01:55:24.117
PART OF OUR OVERALL STRATEGY IN

01:55:24.183 --> 01:55:25.051
CALIFORNIA AND FRANKLY

01:55:25.118 --> 01:55:26.185
EVERYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD IF

01:55:26.252 --> 01:55:26.886
WE'RE GOING TO SOLVE THIS

01:55:26.953 --> 01:55:29.956
PROBLEM. BUT WE CANNOT INDULGE.

01:55:30.023 --> 01:55:31.157
IN MAGICAL THINKING TO GET THE

01:55:31.224 --> 01:55:33.026
JOB DONE. IT'S GOING TO TAKE

01:55:33.092 --> 01:55:35.094
DIFFICULT WORK TO GET TO THE

01:55:35.161 --> 01:55:36.596
CARBON NEUTRALITY GOAL

01:55:36.663 --> 01:55:37.830
PARTICULARLY BY TWENTY FORTY

01:55:37.897 --> 01:55:39.465
FIVE- I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

01:55:39.532 --> 01:55:41.734
TECHNICAL WORK THAT SHOWS. HOW

01:55:41.801 --> 01:55:42.201
TO MAKE THE KINDS OF

01:55:42.268 --> 01:55:44.170
TRANSITIONS THAT ARE NEEDED.

01:55:44.237 --> 01:55:45.238
HOW YOU WOULD DO THAT HOW YOU

01:55:45.305 --> 01:55:46.706
WOULD IMPLEMENT THAT- I'M

01:55:46.773 --> 01:55:48.441
ENCOURAGED THE CARD IS PLANNING

01:55:48.508 --> 01:55:49.942
AND THINKING ABOUT THAT. AND

01:55:50.009 --> 01:55:51.511
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT TALKING

01:55:51.577 --> 01:55:53.980
ABOUT CARBON NEUTRALITY BY

01:55:54.047 --> 01:55:54.580
TWENTY THIRTY FIVE WHEN WE ARE

01:55:54.647 --> 01:55:56.249
NOT ON TRACK FOR A 40% CUT AND

01:55:56.316 --> 01:55:59.419
REDUCTIONS LET ALONE SOMETHING

01:55:59.485 --> 01:56:00.720
CLOSER TO A 100% NOT CUT. I'M

01:56:00.787 --> 01:56:02.655
ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE EXTENT

01:56:02.722 --> 01:56:04.524
TO WHICH- PROMISES ABOUT THE

01:56:04.590 --> 01:56:06.125
FUTURE ROLE OF CARBON REMOVAL

01:56:06.192 --> 01:56:08.061
HAVE BEEN USED. IN CLIMATE

01:56:08.127 --> 01:56:10.163
POLICY CONVERSATIONS. INCLUDING

01:56:10.229 --> 01:56:11.864
THE PRIVATESECTOR TO DEFRAY

01:56:11.931 --> 01:56:13.066
THE NEEDED ACTION THAT IS

01:56:13.132 --> 01:56:14.500
NEEDED RIGHT NOW. AND I WANT TO

01:56:14.567 --> 01:56:15.868
BE VERY VERY CLEAR AND RAISING

01:56:15.935 --> 01:56:17.403
THESE CONCERNS I'M NOT SOMEBODY

01:56:17.470 --> 01:56:19.105
WHO SAYS CARBON REMOVAL SHOULD

01:56:19.172 --> 01:56:21.708
BE PART OF THE CONSIDERATION- I

01:56:21.774 --> 01:56:22.308
THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART.

01:56:22.375 --> 01:56:24.110
OF WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO. BUT IF

01:56:24.177 --> 01:56:25.845
ONE WANTS TO BANK ON EXTENSIVE

01:56:25.912 --> 01:56:28.047
CARBON REMOVAL AS A GET OUT OF

01:56:28.114 --> 01:56:28.948
JAIL FREE CARD FOR REDUCING OUR

01:56:29.015 --> 01:56:30.917
EMISSIONS. WE'RE SETTING

01:56:30.983 --> 01:56:32.652
OURSELVES UP FOR SERIOUS

01:56:32.719 --> 01:56:35.621
PROBLEMS- I THINK. IT'S REALLY

01:56:35.688 --> 01:56:37.357
PART IN THESE CONVERSATIONS TO

01:56:37.423 --> 01:56:38.324
TALK ABOUT CARBON REMOVAL

01:56:38.391 --> 01:56:40.159
BECAUSE- IT MEANS SO MANY

01:56:40.226 --> 01:56:41.127
DIFFERENT THINGS TO DIFFERENT

01:56:41.194 --> 01:56:44.097
PEOPLE- THE TYPICAL CATEGORIES

01:56:44.163 --> 01:56:45.598
WE SEE BROKEN DOWN WHEN PEOPLE

01:56:45.665 --> 01:56:46.966
TALK ABOUT CARBON REMOVAL THE

01:56:47.033 --> 01:56:47.867
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT ARE

01:56:47.934 --> 01:56:49.302
CALLED. ENGINEERED SOLUTIONS

01:56:49.369 --> 01:56:50.970
FOR YOU THINK ABOUT. CARBON

01:56:51.037 --> 01:56:52.372
CAPTURE AND STORAGE UNDERGROUND

01:56:52.438 --> 01:56:54.273
GEOLOGIC INJECTION MAYBE YOU'RE

01:56:54.340 --> 01:56:55.675
GONNA MINERALIZED CO TWO OUT OF

01:56:55.742 --> 01:56:56.743
THE ATMOSPHERE THROUGH

01:56:56.809 --> 01:56:58.811
CHEMISTRY- PEOPLE ALSO TALK

01:56:58.878 --> 01:56:59.979
ABOUT NATURAL CLIMATE SOLUTIONS

01:57:00.046 --> 01:57:01.814
ARE NATURAL CARBON REMOVAL-

01:57:01.881 --> 01:57:04.684
WHERE WE TALK ABOUT FORESTS AND

01:57:04.751 --> 01:57:05.952
SOILS SEQUESTER MORE CARBON.

01:57:06.018 --> 01:57:07.019
THESE ARE VERY DIFFERENT

01:57:07.086 --> 01:57:08.988
APPROACHES- AND THEY ALL HAVE

01:57:09.055 --> 01:57:10.957
MAJOR RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH%

01:57:11.023 --> 01:57:12.024
THEM THE RISKS ARE OFTEN

01:57:12.091 --> 01:57:14.360
COMPLETELY DISTINCT. AND

01:57:14.427 --> 01:57:15.795
REQUIRE VERY CAREFUL THOUGHT TO

01:57:15.862 --> 01:57:17.697
NOT. TOO HARD ON THE WRONG

01:57:17.764 --> 01:57:19.165
STRATEGY OR COMBINATION OF

01:57:19.232 --> 01:57:21.534
STRATEGIES. ENGINEER CARNIVAL

01:57:21.601 --> 01:57:22.969
IS VERY EASY TO MEASURE IT'S

01:57:23.035 --> 01:57:24.404
VERY EASY TO BE CONFIDENT IN

01:57:24.470 --> 01:57:25.838
THE OUTCOMES WHEN YOU BUILD A

01:57:25.905 --> 01:57:28.241
FACILITY TO- CARBON DIOXIDE

01:57:28.307 --> 01:57:29.275
INTO THE ATMOSPHERE THERE ARE

01:57:29.342 --> 01:57:30.676
SOME DEMONSTRATION FACILITIES

01:57:30.743 --> 01:57:32.478
THE DIFFERENCE. IT IS NOT HARD

01:57:32.545 --> 01:57:34.080
TO MEASURE IT IS VERY HARD TO

01:57:34.147 --> 01:57:34.881
GET COMFORTABLE WITH

01:57:34.947 --> 01:57:35.982
PARTICULARLY WHEN WE THINK

01:57:36.048 --> 01:57:37.517
ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

01:57:37.583 --> 01:57:39.452
THESE TECHNOLOGIES. AND THE

01:57:39.519 --> 01:57:39.919
INCUMBENT FOSSIL FUEL

01:57:39.986 --> 01:57:41.954
INDUSTRIES- WHICH COULD

01:57:42.021 --> 01:57:43.523
POTENTIALLY BE SUPPORTED AND

01:57:43.589 --> 01:57:45.525
HAVE THEIR LIVES EXTENDED BY

01:57:45.591 --> 01:57:46.159
THESE APPROACHES DEPLOYED IN A

01:57:46.225 --> 01:57:47.894
CERTAIN WAY. AND WHICH COULD

01:57:47.960 --> 01:57:49.262
ALSO SEE THESE TECHNOLOGIES

01:57:49.328 --> 01:57:50.563
BECOME A SUSTAINABLE AND

01:57:50.630 --> 01:57:51.964
EQUITABLE PATHWAY FOR HIGH

01:57:52.031 --> 01:57:53.866
QUALITY JOBS TO BE MAINTAINED

01:57:53.933 --> 01:57:55.368
IN THE LOCATIONS IN COMMUNITIES

01:57:55.435 --> 01:57:58.337
WHERE THEY ARE CURRENTLY

01:57:58.404 --> 01:57:58.871
ASSOCIATED WITH THE FOSSIL

01:57:58.938 --> 01:58:00.440
ENERGY SYSTEM. NATURAL CARBON

01:58:00.506 --> 01:58:03.476
SOLUTIONS- ARE VERY EASY TO GET

01:58:03.543 --> 01:58:05.211
COMFORTABLE WITH PEOPLE LOVE

01:58:05.278 --> 01:58:07.146
FORESTS AND SOILS- IT'S

01:58:07.213 --> 01:58:08.548
EXTREMELY HARD TO MEASURE

01:58:08.614 --> 01:58:10.283
CARBON IN THE SYSTEMS IN FACT

01:58:10.349 --> 01:58:11.851
IT'S NOT REALLY BEING DONE WELL

01:58:11.918 --> 01:58:13.186
AT ALL WHEN IT COMES TO

01:58:13.252 --> 01:58:14.887
AGRICULTURAL OR SOIL CARBON.

01:58:14.954 --> 01:58:15.888
AND WHEN IT COMES TO FOREST

01:58:15.955 --> 01:58:17.023
CARBON WE ARE MUCH BETTER AT

01:58:17.089 --> 01:58:18.090
MEASURING IT WILL BE A VERY

01:58:18.157 --> 01:58:19.826
VERY CHALLENGED BY OUR ABILITY

01:58:19.892 --> 01:58:22.161
TO MAKE IT STAY PUT. AND ANYONE

01:58:22.228 --> 01:58:23.596
LIVING IN CALIFORNIA KNOWS WHAT

01:58:23.663 --> 01:58:24.864
THAT MEANS RIGHT NOW WITH THE

01:58:24.931 --> 01:58:26.365
FIRE SEASONS WE HAVE THIS YEAR

01:58:26.432 --> 01:58:28.367
AND LAST YEAR. THE WAY THE

01:58:28.434 --> 01:58:29.969
CALIFORNIA RESOURCES BOARD HAS

01:58:30.036 --> 01:58:32.038
MANAGE THESE ISSUES IN RELATED

01:58:32.104 --> 01:58:33.406
FOREST CLIMATE POLICIES

01:58:33.473 --> 01:58:35.374
INCLUDING A VERY PROMINENT ROLE

01:58:35.441 --> 01:58:36.275
FOR EXPORT CARBON FOREST CARBON

01:58:36.342 --> 01:58:38.344
OFFSETS. IS NOT AT ALL IN

01:58:38.411 --> 01:58:39.345
KEEPING WITH THE SCIENTIFIC

01:58:39.412 --> 01:58:41.280
UNDERSTANDING. OF THE THREAT OF

01:58:41.347 --> 01:58:42.882
FIRE OR ECOLOGICAL SYSTEM

01:58:42.949 --> 01:58:45.585
CHANGE TO FIRES FOR STARRING IN

01:58:45.651 --> 01:58:47.320
THE WESTERN UNITED STATES. I

01:58:47.386 --> 01:58:47.987
THINK IT'S GONNA BE VERY

01:58:48.054 --> 01:58:49.021
DIFFICULT TO GET OUR HEADS

01:58:49.088 --> 01:58:49.956
AROUND THESE THINGS EEN THOUGH

01:58:50.022 --> 01:58:52.191
IT'S VERY EASY TO SAY. WE LIKE

01:58:52.258 --> 01:58:56.529
TREES AND WE LIKE SOILS. AND

01:58:56.596 --> 01:58:57.163
LIKE HEALTHY FARMING PRACTICES.

01:58:57.230 --> 01:58:58.297
AND I ALL THE THINGS WE THESE

01:58:58.364 --> 01:58:59.031
TWO DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO

01:58:59.098 --> 01:59:00.066
CARBON REMOVAL HAVE THEIR OWN

01:59:00.132 --> 01:59:02.101
UNIQUE CHALLENGES AND IF WE-

01:59:02.168 --> 01:59:03.236
ASSUME WE ARE GOING TO SOLVE

01:59:03.302 --> 01:59:05.371
THE PROBLEM. BY ANYONE OF THOSE

01:59:05.438 --> 01:59:06.672
WORKING OUT AT A VERY LARGE

01:59:06.739 --> 01:59:08.841
SCALE AND WE CHOOSE NOT TO TAKE

01:59:08.908 --> 01:59:10.443
SIGNIFICANT ACTION TO INCREASE

01:59:10.510 --> 01:59:12.144
OUR CLIMATE POLICY AMBITIONS.

01:59:12.211 --> 01:59:14.146
WE WILL GET NOW CLOSE. TO

01:59:14.213 --> 01:59:15.381
CARBON NEUTRALITY AND WE WILL

01:59:15.448 --> 01:59:16.849
WASTE OPPORTUNITIES TO

01:59:16.916 --> 01:59:17.984
MEANINGFULLY IMPROVE

01:59:18.050 --> 01:59:18.718
CALIFORNIANS LIVES IN THE

01:59:18.784 --> 01:59:21.287
INTERIM. I APOLOGIZE FOR THE

01:59:21.354 --> 01:59:22.788
TONE OF MY REMARKS BUT IT IS A

01:59:22.855 --> 01:59:24.390
VERY DIFFICULT THING TO LOOK

01:59:24.457 --> 01:59:25.424
FOR CLIMB THE PROBLEM SQUARE IN

01:59:25.491 --> 01:59:27.927
THE EYE AND TO. ACKNOWLEDGE THE

01:59:27.994 --> 01:59:28.995
GRAVITY OF WHAT IS HAPPENING

01:59:29.061 --> 01:59:30.930
AND WHAT IS REQUIRED TO ADDRESS

01:59:30.997 --> 01:59:32.765
THE PROBLEMS BEFORE US. AND IT

01:59:32.832 --> 01:59:34.800
IS DEEPLY FRUSTRATING AND-

01:59:34.867 --> 01:59:37.336
PAINFUL TO. PARTICIPATE IN

01:59:37.403 --> 01:59:39.739
CONVERSATIONS WHERE WE DO NOT

01:59:39.805 --> 01:59:40.740
SPEAK HONESTLY ABOUT WHAT IS

01:59:40.806 --> 01:59:43.042
REQUIRED. TO BEGIN TO SOLVE THE

01:59:43.109 --> 01:59:44.644
PROBLEMS THAT ARE BEFORE US.

01:59:44.710 --> 01:59:45.912
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR

01:59:45.978 --> 01:59:47.146
TIME AND LOOK FOR THE ANSWER

01:59:47.213 --> 01:59:50.383
ANY QUESTIONS. THAT THE

01:59:50.449 --> 01:59:51.217
COMMITTEE MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU

01:59:51.284 --> 01:59:53.219
VERY MUCH CALLING WORD. CENTER

01:59:53.286 --> 01:59:56.889
SKINNER. SO DOCTOR CONGER YOU

01:59:56.956 --> 01:59:58.991
APOLOGIZE FOR YOUR TOTAL BUT

01:59:59.058 --> 02:00:01.360
YOU KNOW I DON'T I APPRECIATE

02:00:01.427 --> 02:00:02.895
SOMEONE BEING FRANK HOWEVER.

02:00:02.962 --> 02:00:11.737
WHAT I. THE ENORMITY THE

02:00:11.804 --> 02:00:14.240
GRAVITY OF THE CRISIS YOU ARE

02:00:14.307 --> 02:00:16.409
BEING VERY FRANK ABOUT THE

02:00:16.475 --> 02:00:18.811
THEIR REALITY IN THE NECESSITY

02:00:18.878 --> 02:00:20.980
FOR THE TRANSITION OFF FOSSIL

02:00:21.047 --> 02:00:24.951
FUELS AS FAST AS WE CAN. FRANK

02:00:25.017 --> 02:00:26.452
HOWEVER I FEEL LIKE THE

02:00:26.519 --> 02:00:31.057
DISCUSSION AROUND THE CAPTURE

02:00:31.123 --> 02:00:33.426
OR THE SEQUESTRATION WITHIN.

02:00:33.492 --> 02:00:36.796
THE NATURAL SYSTEMS. YOU KNOW I

02:00:36.862 --> 02:00:41.434
GUESS I FEEL IT'S. I FELT YOUR

02:00:41.500 --> 02:00:44.337
VET CAVALIER BECAUSE I IN NO

02:00:44.403 --> 02:00:47.907
WAY WANT TO DIMINISH. THE

02:00:47.974 --> 02:00:50.309
ESSENTIAL OF THE OTHER AND DO

02:00:50.376 --> 02:00:54.680
NOT WANT A DIRECTION OR

02:00:54.747 --> 02:00:56.148
INACTION TOWARDS ANYTHING

02:00:56.215 --> 02:00:59.585
WITHIN OUR NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS

02:00:59.652 --> 02:01:01.554
TO BY ANY MEANS REPLACE OR TO

02:01:01.621 --> 02:01:03.589
BE THE DOMINANT STRATEGY.

02:01:03.656 --> 02:01:07.827
HOWEVER I. EIGHT I. D. I GUESS

02:01:07.893 --> 02:01:10.496
I QUESTION YOUR DESCRIPTION

02:01:10.563 --> 02:01:12.898
THAT THE SCIENCE AROUND THE

02:01:12.965 --> 02:01:16.369
CAPACITY OF BIOLOGICAL.

02:01:16.435 --> 02:01:20.506
PROSTHESES TO IT HAS THAT'S

02:01:20.573 --> 02:01:21.674
INEFFECTIVE WE LOOK AT THE

02:01:21.741 --> 02:01:23.042
CARBON CYCLE THAT'S WHAT THE

02:01:23.109 --> 02:01:26.779
CARBON CYCLE IS AND WHILE WE

02:01:26.846 --> 02:01:28.547
MAY NOT HAVE GOOD MEASURING

02:01:28.614 --> 02:01:30.249
TOOLS AND I AGREE WITH THAT AND

02:01:30.316 --> 02:01:32.251
CLEARLY AS OUR FORESTS BURNED

02:01:32.318 --> 02:01:34.820
OBVIOUSLY RELYING ON OUR

02:01:34.887 --> 02:01:37.456
FORESTS TO BE OUR CARBON

02:01:37.523 --> 02:01:42.428
CAPTURE IS INADEQUATE BUT THE

02:01:42.495 --> 02:01:47.166
CAPACITY OF. MICROORGANISMS

02:01:47.233 --> 02:01:49.902
WITHIN A VARIETY OF ECOSYSTEMS

02:01:49.969 --> 02:01:52.705
IS STRONG AND THERE ARE OTHER

02:01:52.772 --> 02:01:55.975
BENEFICIAL. OF BENEFITS TO THAT

02:01:56.042 --> 02:01:59.578
SO I GUESS. I WONDER IF YOUR

02:01:59.645 --> 02:02:03.683
ARE YOU BEING ASKED IN MY WORDS

02:02:03.749 --> 02:02:05.818
CAVALIER BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID

02:02:05.885 --> 02:02:07.853
THAT THAT THAT WE WOULD GO IN

02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:10.322
THAT DIRECTION AT THE EXPENSE

02:02:10.389 --> 02:02:12.091
OF THE FOSTER REDUCTIONS OR

02:02:12.158 --> 02:02:13.659
BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME SIGNS

02:02:13.726 --> 02:02:17.730
THAT I'M NOT SEEN. THANK YOU

02:02:17.797 --> 02:02:18.731
SENATOR SKINNER AND I

02:02:18.798 --> 02:02:20.966
APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:02:21.033 --> 02:02:24.870
SPEAK FRANKLY- I THINK THE

02:02:24.937 --> 02:02:27.540
NATURE OF MY CONCERN IS

02:02:27.606 --> 02:02:29.141
PRIMARILY ONE THAT DEPENDING ON

02:02:29.208 --> 02:02:30.476
HOW WE SET UP OUR POLICY

02:02:30.543 --> 02:02:32.344
TARGETS WE COULD SUBSTITUTE.

02:02:32.411 --> 02:02:34.046
AWAY FROM DIRECT EMISSION

02:02:34.113 --> 02:02:35.815
REDUCTIONS BY ASSUMING WE WILL

02:02:35.881 --> 02:02:37.817
DELIVER LARGE VOLUMES OF CARBON

02:02:37.883 --> 02:02:39.251
REMOVAL THAT TURNS OUT NOT TO

02:02:39.318 --> 02:02:40.686
BE POSSIBLE IN THE WAYS WE HAD

02:02:40.753 --> 02:02:42.421
HOPED AN ANTICIPATED SO I DO

02:02:42.488 --> 02:02:44.290
WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT CONCERN

02:02:44.356 --> 02:02:46.792
AND I HEAR YOU SAYING THAT IT'S

02:02:46.859 --> 02:02:47.326
NOT FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU ARE

02:02:47.393 --> 02:02:49.729
ADVOCATING FOR- AND I DIDN'T

02:02:49.795 --> 02:02:51.263
MEAN TO SUGGEST OTHERWISE. HOW

02:02:51.330 --> 02:02:53.032
WE DEFINE CARBON NEUTRALITY AND

02:02:53.099 --> 02:02:54.800
WHETHER OR NOT WE REQUIRE A

02:02:54.867 --> 02:02:56.068
MINIMUM DIRECT EMISSION

02:02:56.135 --> 02:02:57.903
REDUCTION SPEAKS DIRECTLY TO

02:02:57.970 --> 02:03:00.039
THAT QUESTION AND ON THAT ISSUE

02:03:00.106 --> 02:03:02.708
I THINK. THE SCIENCE STRONGLY

02:03:02.775 --> 02:03:04.643
COUNSELS BEING RISK AVERSE ON

02:03:04.710 --> 02:03:06.045
THESE ISSUES AND BEING

02:03:06.112 --> 02:03:06.912
THOUGHTFUL AND CONSIDERATE

02:03:06.979 --> 02:03:09.148
ABOUT PUSHING FIRST AND

02:03:09.215 --> 02:03:09.949
FOREMOST ON DIRECT EMISSION

02:03:10.015 --> 02:03:11.784
REDUCTIONS AND I SAID THIS IS

02:03:11.851 --> 02:03:12.518
SOMEBODY WHO THINKS CARBON

02:03:12.585 --> 02:03:14.386
REMOVAL HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE

02:03:14.453 --> 02:03:15.287
TO PLAY AND I DON'T WANT TO

02:03:15.354 --> 02:03:19.492
DIMINISH- THE MOTIVATIONS THAT-

02:03:19.558 --> 02:03:21.160
THAT HAD EVEN OTHERS BRING TO

02:03:21.227 --> 02:03:22.695
THAT CONVERSATION. YOU

02:03:22.762 --> 02:03:23.629
UNDERSTAND THE SCIENCE SIDE

02:03:23.696 --> 02:03:24.530
ACTUALLY THE SCIENCE IS

02:03:24.597 --> 02:03:25.931
INCREASINGLY CLEAR THAT THE

02:03:25.998 --> 02:03:28.868
RISKS FROM FIRE AND DROUGHT TO

02:03:28.934 --> 02:03:30.169
THE PROMINENCE OF FOREST NOT

02:03:30.236 --> 02:03:31.437
THE ABILITY OF TREES THE UPTAKE

02:03:31.504 --> 02:03:32.705
CARBON BUT THE ABILITY OF

02:03:32.772 --> 02:03:34.473
ECOSYSTEMS TO SUSTAIN IN THE

02:03:34.540 --> 02:03:36.175
FACE OF THE ECOLOGICAL CHANGE

02:03:36.242 --> 02:03:37.276
WE ARE OBSERVING WHICH IS

02:03:37.343 --> 02:03:38.911
ACCELERATING RAPIDLY. IT'S

02:03:38.978 --> 02:03:40.646
INCREASINGLY CLEAR THERE ARE

02:03:40.713 --> 02:03:42.248
PARTS OF CALIFORNIA THAT ARE

02:03:42.314 --> 02:03:43.516
NOT GOING TO HAVE FOREST BY THE

02:03:43.582 --> 02:03:44.483
END OF THE CENTURY THAT

02:03:44.550 --> 02:03:45.651
HISTORICALLY THROUGHOUT ALL OF

02:03:45.718 --> 02:03:47.286
OUR LIVES TO THE MEMORIES OF

02:03:47.353 --> 02:03:48.354
THE FAMILIES WHO MOVED HERE

02:03:48.420 --> 02:03:50.689
BEFORE. I'M OUT FOR US I THINK

02:03:50.756 --> 02:03:51.857
THAT'S ACTUALLY INCREASINGLY

02:03:51.924 --> 02:03:53.726
CLEAR AS A SCIENTIFIC FACT THAT

02:03:53.793 --> 02:03:55.628
IT'S VERY LIKELY TO HAPPEN SOME

02:03:55.694 --> 02:03:58.030
AREAS THE PRESSURES FROM THE

02:03:58.097 --> 02:03:59.331
CLIMATE SYSTEM ON THE

02:03:59.398 --> 02:04:01.300
FUNDAMENTAL DRIVERS OF FIRE

02:04:01.367 --> 02:04:05.204
RISK ARE INCREASING RAPIDLY AS

02:04:05.271 --> 02:04:06.472
THE CONCERN HERE IS NOT WHETHER

02:04:06.539 --> 02:04:08.407
NOT TREES UP TO CARMEN. IT'S

02:04:08.474 --> 02:04:09.942
HOW STABLE ARE OUR CURRENT

02:04:10.009 --> 02:04:11.443
LANDSCAPE PATTERNS AND THE WAY

02:04:11.510 --> 02:04:13.245
WE MANAGE THOSE LANDS ARE THE

02:04:13.312 --> 02:04:15.281
TRADE OFFS BETWEEN TRYING TO

02:04:15.347 --> 02:04:16.148
MANAGE FOR CARBON AND MANAGING

02:04:16.215 --> 02:04:18.017
FOR FIRE. AND IF WE PUT ALL OUR

02:04:18.083 --> 02:04:18.884
EGGS IN THE FOREST CARBON

02:04:18.951 --> 02:04:20.419
BASKET AND WE DO SO IN A WAY

02:04:20.486 --> 02:04:25.691
THAT SUBSTITUTES. AWAY FROM

02:04:25.758 --> 02:04:26.325
DIRECT EMISSION REDUCTIONS THAT

02:04:26.392 --> 02:04:27.459
I THINK IT'S SOMETHING AVOID.

02:04:27.526 --> 02:04:28.861
EVEN THOUGH I WHICH- AND WHO.

02:04:28.928 --> 02:04:29.528
WANTS TO CAREFULLY LOOK AT

02:04:29.595 --> 02:04:30.729
POTENTIAL INCLUDING THE CURRENT

02:04:30.796 --> 02:04:32.731
RISKS. WITH NATURAL CLIMATE

02:04:32.798 --> 02:04:34.300
SOLUTIONS I'M LOOKING AT WHAT

02:04:34.366 --> 02:04:36.101
WE CAN DO ON THAT FRONT.

02:04:36.168 --> 02:04:38.904
WITHOUT CLOSING OUR EYES TO. BE

02:04:38.971 --> 02:04:40.873
CLIMATE RISKS THAT ARE VERY

02:04:40.940 --> 02:04:48.647
MUCH IN FRONT OF US. FREESHEET

02:04:48.714 --> 02:04:49.949
CLARIFICATION THOUGH I DON'T

02:04:50.015 --> 02:04:51.050
THINK IT NECESSARILY ANSWER THE

02:04:51.116 --> 02:04:53.219
QUESTION IT REINFORCED THAT YOU

02:04:53.285 --> 02:04:55.487
DON'T WANT US WHICH I AGREE

02:04:55.554 --> 02:04:58.791
WITH TO RELY. NOT ONLY DOMINANT

02:04:58.858 --> 02:05:01.260
LEAD BUT EVEN WHATEVER TO HAVE

02:05:01.327 --> 02:05:03.963
ANY ILLUSION ABOUT. THE

02:05:04.029 --> 02:05:06.866
NECESSITY FOR THE ACTUAL

02:05:06.932 --> 02:05:10.069
REDUCTIONS- MEANING DIRECT

02:05:10.135 --> 02:05:11.904
EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS NOW

02:05:11.971 --> 02:05:14.340
HOWEVER I THINK THAT THE

02:05:14.406 --> 02:05:17.710
SCIENCE ON. THE CAPACITY OF THE

02:05:17.776 --> 02:05:22.147
CARBON CYCLE TO IF WE WERE-

02:05:22.214 --> 02:05:25.517
RESPECTING IT. GREATER THE

02:05:25.584 --> 02:05:26.952
CAPACITY FOR IT TO KEEP TO

02:05:27.019 --> 02:05:31.690
STORE CARBON IS STILL HIGH.

02:05:31.757 --> 02:05:34.727
THANKING CENTER BACKER. THANK

02:05:34.793 --> 02:05:37.429
YOU I GUESS. I'M MOVE AWAY FROM

02:05:37.496 --> 02:05:38.898
EITHER OR FROM AN EXTERNAL

02:05:38.964 --> 02:05:40.332
DON'T AS TO CENTER SKITTISH

02:05:40.399 --> 02:05:42.434
POINTED DIMINISH THE ABILITY OF

02:05:42.501 --> 02:05:43.936
AN ACTUAL WORKING LANDS TO

02:05:44.003 --> 02:05:46.672
SEQUESTER CARBON BUT- THIS CALL

02:05:46.739 --> 02:05:49.008
WOULD YOU BEEN OUTSPOKEN ABOUT

02:05:49.074 --> 02:05:49.541
THE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:05:49.608 --> 02:05:51.043
OFFSETS WE'RE GRANTING. THAT

02:05:51.110 --> 02:05:53.646
REALLY HAVE A CLIMATE BENEFIT

02:05:53.712 --> 02:05:54.980
EQUIVALENT TO ALLOWING. POWER

02:05:55.047 --> 02:05:56.181
PLANT OR FACTORY TO MEET AN

02:05:56.248 --> 02:05:58.317
EXTRA. TEN OF CO TWO RIGHT

02:05:58.384 --> 02:06:00.019
OTHERWISE WERE ALLOWING. EXTRA

02:06:00.085 --> 02:06:01.687
POLLUTION WITHOUT TRULY GETTING

02:06:01.754 --> 02:06:04.556
OFFSETTING. THE BENEFITS SO CAN

02:06:04.623 --> 02:06:05.124
YOU ELABORATE ON SOME

02:06:05.190 --> 02:06:07.259
SITUATIONS IN WHICH- YOU ARE

02:06:07.326 --> 02:06:08.661
CONCERNED THESE OFFSETS ARE

02:06:08.727 --> 02:06:12.431
NOT. MEETING THAT STANDARD

02:06:12.498 --> 02:06:12.965
WE'RE GETTING A OFFSETTING

02:06:13.032 --> 02:06:16.068
BENEFITS. SURE I'LL BE HAPPY TO

02:06:16.135 --> 02:06:18.971
AND I WANT TO- BEFORE I DO THAT

02:06:19.038 --> 02:06:20.372
JUST MENTIONED THAT THE FRAMING

02:06:20.439 --> 02:06:21.874
OF CARBON OFFSETS FOR YOU ALLOW

02:06:21.941 --> 02:06:22.908
A POLLUTER TO CONTINUE

02:06:22.975 --> 02:06:24.243
POLLUTING IN RETURN FOR A

02:06:24.310 --> 02:06:25.844
PROMISE OF A REDUCTION ST IN A

02:06:25.911 --> 02:06:28.080
FOREST SYSTEM. IS THE OPPOSITE

02:06:28.147 --> 02:06:29.548
OF WHAT I HEARD SENATOR SKINNER

02:06:29.615 --> 02:06:30.749
ADVOCATE FOR WHAT WE'RE YOU'RE

02:06:30.816 --> 02:06:32.418
PURSUING IDEALLY BOTH

02:06:32.484 --> 02:06:33.585
STRATEGIES AT THE SAME TIME

02:06:33.652 --> 02:06:35.487
THIS IS AN EITHER OR SITUATION

02:06:35.554 --> 02:06:37.156
AND I THINK THAT'S THE CRUX OF

02:06:37.222 --> 02:06:39.258
THE PROBLEM. WITH THE OFFSETS

02:06:39.325 --> 02:06:41.026
PROGRAM TODAY THERE ARE A

02:06:41.093 --> 02:06:42.394
COUPLE DIFFERENT PROBLEMS IN

02:06:42.461 --> 02:06:43.662
THE OFFSETS PROGRAM I THINK

02:06:43.729 --> 02:06:46.699
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF- I THINK

02:06:46.765 --> 02:06:47.900
VERY IMPORTANT INVESTIGATIVE

02:06:47.967 --> 02:06:49.368
JOURNALISM THAT IS DOCUMENTED

02:06:49.435 --> 02:06:50.669
SCENARIOS WHERE PEOPLE ARE

02:06:50.736 --> 02:06:52.304
CLAIMING CREDIT FOR BUSINESS AS

02:06:52.371 --> 02:06:53.973
USUAL ACTIVITIES. SO THEY'RE

02:06:54.039 --> 02:06:55.207
DOING THE SAME THINGS THEY WERE

02:06:55.274 --> 02:06:57.076
PLANNING TO DO THEY'RE NOW

02:06:57.142 --> 02:06:57.977
CLAIMING THAT THE THING THAT

02:06:58.043 --> 02:06:59.244
THEY WERE ALWAYS DOING IS A NEW

02:06:59.311 --> 02:07:01.080
CHANGE AND THEREFORE JUSTIFIES

02:07:01.146 --> 02:07:03.248
CREDITS THAT ALLOW FOR EXAMPLE

02:07:03.315 --> 02:07:05.250
A STATIONARY SOURCE REFINERY OF

02:07:05.317 --> 02:07:06.785
POWER PLANT TO INCREASE OR

02:07:06.852 --> 02:07:08.921
MAINTAIN ITS EMISSIONS. SO THIS

02:07:08.988 --> 02:07:10.222
PROBLEM OF NONTRADITIONAL

02:07:10.289 --> 02:07:11.557
CREDITING I THINK WHEN WE LOOK

02:07:11.623 --> 02:07:12.958
REALLY CAREFULLY THE SYSTEM TO

02:07:13.025 --> 02:07:14.259
FIND A LOT OF EVIDENCE THAT

02:07:14.326 --> 02:07:15.427
THAT PEOPLE ARE DOING BUSINESS

02:07:15.494 --> 02:07:16.595
AS USUAL ACTIVITIES AND

02:07:16.662 --> 02:07:18.664
CLAIMING THAT SOMETHING NEW- I

02:07:18.731 --> 02:07:20.032
WAS INVOLVED IN ON A LARGE

02:07:20.099 --> 02:07:20.833
SCALE STUDY THAT LOOKED AT

02:07:20.899 --> 02:07:22.301
ANOTHER QUESTION WHERE THE

02:07:22.368 --> 02:07:23.502
FUNDAMENTAL ACCOUNTING

02:07:23.569 --> 02:07:25.204
MECHANISMS BY WHICH- THE

02:07:25.270 --> 02:07:26.171
CREDITS ARE AWARDED IT

02:07:26.238 --> 02:07:28.140
CALIFORNIA'S CARBON OFFSETS

02:07:28.207 --> 02:07:29.942
SYSTEM. HI MY COLLEAGUES AND I

02:07:30.009 --> 02:07:31.410
THINK ARE INFLATING THE STATED

02:07:31.477 --> 02:07:33.345
CLIMATE REDUCTIONS BY ABOUT 30%

02:07:33.412 --> 02:07:34.713
FROM WHAT WE COULD SEE WITH

02:07:34.780 --> 02:07:35.714
WHETHER IT TO THE BEST OF MY

02:07:35.781 --> 02:07:37.449
KNOWLEDGE AS THE FIRST

02:07:37.516 --> 02:07:38.083
INDEPENDENT AUDIT OF THE ENTIRE

02:07:38.150 --> 02:07:41.053
PROGRAM- WE ARE ALSO SEEING

02:07:41.120 --> 02:07:42.988
RIGHT NOW I THINK A CRISIS-

02:07:43.055 --> 02:07:44.356
STARTED IN A MOST VISIBLY LAST

02:07:44.423 --> 02:07:46.225
YEAR BUT IT'S BEEN AN ISSUE IN

02:07:46.291 --> 02:07:47.159
THE PROGRAM FOR SOME TIME

02:07:47.226 --> 02:07:49.528
WHERE. THE PREVALENCE OF FOREST

02:07:49.595 --> 02:07:50.963
FIRES IS RENDERING THAT

02:07:51.030 --> 02:07:52.064
PROMINENCE CLAIMS THAT THESE

02:07:52.131 --> 02:07:53.565
OFFSET PROJECTS ARE MAKING THAT

02:07:53.632 --> 02:07:54.466
THEY'RE GOING TO PROTECT AND

02:07:54.533 --> 02:07:56.835
STORE THE CARBON IN THE TREES.

02:07:56.902 --> 02:08:02.307
FOR AT LEAST A HUNDRED YEARS.

02:08:02.374 --> 02:08:02.908
I'M THAT IS NOT LOOKING LIKE A

02:08:02.975 --> 02:08:03.509
VERY SAFE THAT. I'M WE HAD A

02:08:03.575 --> 02:08:04.143
COUPLE OF FIRE IN THE LAST FEW

02:08:04.209 --> 02:08:06.111
YEARS. THE LIKE FIRE IN

02:08:06.178 --> 02:08:06.912
SOUTHERN OREGON VERY

02:08:06.979 --> 02:08:08.180
PROMINENTLY HAS BEEN

02:08:08.247 --> 02:08:09.114
SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTING A LARGE

02:08:09.181 --> 02:08:11.683
PROJECT- CALLED PLYMOUTH EAST

02:08:11.750 --> 02:08:12.951
AND WE HAVE RIGHT NOW AN

02:08:13.018 --> 02:08:14.486
UNCONTROLLED FIRE BURNING IN

02:08:14.553 --> 02:08:16.188
ONE OF THE LARGEST PROJECTS.

02:08:16.255 --> 02:08:17.823
THE OFFSETS PROGRAM UP EASTERN

02:08:17.890 --> 02:08:21.860
WASHINGTON THE COCOA PROJECT-

02:08:21.927 --> 02:08:23.929
THE SCALE OF THE CARBON LOSSES

02:08:23.996 --> 02:08:25.731
THAT WE EXPECT FROM THE

02:08:25.798 --> 02:08:27.066
PROJECTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY ON

02:08:27.132 --> 02:08:28.133
FIRE AND IT RECENTLY BEEN ON

02:08:28.200 --> 02:08:30.269
FIRE ARE NOT AT ALL CONSISTENT.

02:08:30.335 --> 02:08:31.637
WITH THE PROTECTIONS THAT THE

02:08:31.703 --> 02:08:34.406
PROGRAM IS ANTICIPATED- FOR

02:08:34.473 --> 02:08:35.374
MAKING SURE THAT THE OVERALL

02:08:35.441 --> 02:08:37.009
INTEGRITY THE PROGRAM DELIVERS

02:08:37.076 --> 02:08:38.944
THOSE REAL CLIMATE BENEFITS.

02:08:39.011 --> 02:08:40.345
AND IT'S ALSO PRETTY CLEAR AT

02:08:40.412 --> 02:08:42.181
THIS POINT THAT THE PROGRAM IS

02:08:42.247 --> 02:08:43.549
NOT DESIGNED WITH EITHER

02:08:43.615 --> 02:08:45.451
CLIMATE RISKS IN MIND OR EVEN

02:08:45.517 --> 02:08:46.919
TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT

02:08:46.985 --> 02:08:48.520
THAT. WESTERN FORESTS ARE MUCH

02:08:48.587 --> 02:08:50.622
MORE FIRE PRONE EASTERN FORESTS

02:08:50.689 --> 02:08:52.458
EVERYBODY FACES THE SAME SORT

02:08:52.524 --> 02:08:54.326
OF INSURANCE RISK PREMIUM.

02:08:54.393 --> 02:08:55.461
WHETHER THEY'RE LOCATED IN AN

02:08:55.527 --> 02:08:57.096
AREA THE PARENTS REGULARLY AND

02:08:57.162 --> 02:08:59.198
WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY KERN- AS

02:08:59.264 --> 02:09:00.299
AREAS OF EASTERN WASHINGTON

02:09:00.365 --> 02:09:02.267
SOUTHERN OREGON AND PARTS OF

02:09:02.334 --> 02:09:03.035
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WILL IN OUR

02:09:03.102 --> 02:09:04.570
LIFETIMES. OR WHETHER THEY'RE

02:09:04.636 --> 02:09:05.938
LOCATED IN A IN A FAIRLY FIRE

02:09:06.004 --> 02:09:07.573
SAFE PLACE LIKE FOR EXAMPLE

02:09:07.639 --> 02:09:10.676
UPSTATE NEW YORK. OR VERMONT SO

02:09:10.742 --> 02:09:12.044
MR JUST THREE WISHES I COULD GO

02:09:12.111 --> 02:09:13.679
ON BUT I THINK THE OFFSETS

02:09:13.745 --> 02:09:15.647
PROGRAM IS AN EXAMPLE OF AN

02:09:15.714 --> 02:09:18.117
AREA WHERE WE HAVE-

02:09:18.183 --> 02:09:21.854
COLLECTIVELY. IN THE STATE

02:09:21.920 --> 02:09:23.489
EMPHASIZED. OUR FOR CLAIMING

02:09:23.555 --> 02:09:25.691
CLIMATE BENEFITS IN FORESTS AND

02:09:25.757 --> 02:09:26.825
THE SO CALLED NATURAL CLIMATE

02:09:26.892 --> 02:09:28.427
SOLUTIONS THAT HAVE DIVERTED

02:09:28.494 --> 02:09:29.728
ATTENTION AWAY FROM DIRECT

02:09:29.795 --> 02:09:31.964
EMISSION REDUCTIONS. THAT IS

02:09:32.030 --> 02:09:33.699
NOT THE ONLY WAY WE CAN PURSUE.

02:09:33.765 --> 02:09:35.534
ACTIVITIES IN THAT SPACE BUT IT

02:09:35.601 --> 02:09:37.603
IS THE WAY WE HAVE INVESTED

02:09:37.669 --> 02:09:40.005
SEVERAL BILLION DOLLARS SO FAR.

02:09:40.072 --> 02:09:45.577
THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS

02:09:45.644 --> 02:09:48.213

KNOW IT CAN BE INCREDIBLY

02:09:58.357 --> 02:10:01.493
FRUSTRATING- THE AS AS WE ARE

02:10:01.560 --> 02:10:02.461
TRYING TO FIGURE ALL OF THIS

02:10:02.528 --> 02:10:05.664
OUT AFFECT IF IT'S OKAY- TO

02:10:05.731 --> 02:10:06.365
REPEAT SOMETHING IT SENATORS

02:10:06.431 --> 02:10:08.000
SKINNER SAID EARLIER TALKING

02:10:08.066 --> 02:10:08.901
ABOUT THAT SHE'D BEEN WORKING

02:10:08.967 --> 02:10:11.003
ON THIS- BEEN ALMOST TWENTY

02:10:11.069 --> 02:10:12.771
FIVE YEARS SINCE. SHE WAS EIGHT

02:10:12.838 --> 02:10:14.373
THAT KYOTO I KNOW IT'S A LOT OF

02:10:14.439 --> 02:10:15.607
PEOPLE TO WORK ON THIS FOR A

02:10:15.674 --> 02:10:18.076
VERY VERY LONG TIME AND EVEN

02:10:18.143 --> 02:10:19.378
THOUGH I HEAR THE INTENSITY IN

02:10:19.444 --> 02:10:22.047
YOUR VOICE- I DIDN'T HEAR A

02:10:22.114 --> 02:10:24.650
WHOLE LOT OF HOPE AND SO MAYBE

02:10:24.716 --> 02:10:26.752

LITTLE BIT OF HOPE- AND I WANT

TO COME BACK TO THAT AND HAVE

02:10:34.226 --> 02:10:36.328
YOU ADDRESS IT. BUT WHEN YOU

02:10:36.395 --> 02:10:37.930
TALK ABOUT DIRECT EMISSIONS

02:10:37.996 --> 02:10:39.498
REDUCTIONS AND I WANT TO TALK A

02:10:39.565 --> 02:10:41.033
LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT AS A

02:10:41.099 --> 02:10:42.000
MEMBER BURKE WAS SAYING WE'RE

02:10:42.067 --> 02:10:43.902
TALKING ABOUT EQUITY THE FOLKS

02:10:43.969 --> 02:10:45.871
THAT LIVE IN IN MY DISTRICT IN-

02:10:45.938 --> 02:10:47.873
IN THE INLAND EMPIRE ASSEMBLY

02:10:47.940 --> 02:10:49.775
IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY AND THEY

02:10:49.841 --> 02:10:51.009
CAN AFFORD TO LIVE THERE THEY

02:10:51.076 --> 02:10:52.477
CAN AFFORD TO BUY HOMES THERE

02:10:52.544 --> 02:10:53.378
BUT FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO

02:10:53.445 --> 02:10:54.947
AFFORD. A TO BUY HOMES THERE

02:10:55.013 --> 02:10:56.515
THEY HAVE TO GET IN THEIR CAR-

02:10:56.582 --> 02:10:58.183
WHICH ARE POLLUTERS A TO BE

02:10:58.250 --> 02:10:59.585
ABLE TO DRIVE INTO SAN DIEGO

02:10:59.651 --> 02:11:02.454
THE ORANGE COUNTY AND LA WHERE

02:11:02.521 --> 02:11:03.789
THEY WORK THEY CAN AFFORD TO

02:11:03.855 --> 02:11:06.858
LIVE IN THOSE COUNTIES SO THEY

02:11:06.925 --> 02:11:08.794
LIVE IN A MY TO COUNTIES AND

02:11:08.860 --> 02:11:09.995
THEN GET IN THEIR CAR AND THEY

02:11:10.062 --> 02:11:12.097
DRIVE A TWO TWO AND A HALF

02:11:12.164 --> 02:11:13.832
HOURS EVERY SINGLE DAY. A TO BE

02:11:13.899 --> 02:11:15.133
ABLE TO WORK AND THEY'RE

02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:16.535
POLLUTING THERE'S A COST FOR

02:11:16.602 --> 02:11:17.869
THAT THEY'VE MOVED OUT BECAUSE

02:11:17.936 --> 02:11:18.837
THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE IN

02:11:18.904 --> 02:11:20.439
THOSE IN THOSE OTHER COUNTIES

02:11:20.505 --> 02:11:22.007
AND SO THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE

02:11:22.074 --> 02:11:23.442
OF GETTING IN THEIR CAR AND

02:11:23.508 --> 02:11:24.643
THEIR- PUTTING GAS IN THEIR

02:11:24.710 --> 02:11:25.744
VEHICLES- AND THEY ARE

02:11:25.811 --> 02:11:27.613
POLLUTING BY DRIVING INTO

02:11:27.679 --> 02:11:28.747
THESE- IN THESE OTHER COUNTIES

02:11:28.814 --> 02:11:30.882
THIS IS THE QUESTION OF. OF

02:11:30.949 --> 02:11:32.517
EQUITY THAT COMES UP SO WE ARE

02:11:32.584 --> 02:11:33.785
TALKING ABOUT THE DIRECT

02:11:33.852 --> 02:11:35.787
EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS A WHAT I

02:11:35.854 --> 02:11:37.222
HEAR IN THAT IS THAT IT'S GOING

02:11:37.289 --> 02:11:38.123
TO COST THE PEOPLE IN MY

02:11:38.190 --> 02:11:41.193
DISTRICT MORE MONEY TO BE ABLE

02:11:41.260 --> 02:11:43.161
TO SURVIVE TO BE ABLE TO LIVE.

02:11:43.228 --> 02:11:48.100
SOME OF US HAVE SOME HOPE WHEN

02:11:48.166 --> 02:11:49.401
WE HEAR OF FROM- THE- THERE'S

02:11:49.468 --> 02:11:49.935
TWO COMPANIES THAT I KNOW

02:11:50.002 --> 02:11:51.637
BECAUSE- WORKS AND CARBON

02:11:51.703 --> 02:11:53.605
ENGINEERING- THAT ARE. I'VE

02:11:53.672 --> 02:11:54.439
BEEN WORKING ON A DIRECT AIR

02:11:54.506 --> 02:11:56.675
CAPTURE- THE TECHNOLOGY MAYBE

02:11:56.742 --> 02:11:58.610
ISN'T. NECESSARILY THERE YET

02:11:58.677 --> 02:11:59.978
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE. THEY'RE ABLE

02:12:00.045 --> 02:12:01.847
TO SUCK STUFF OUT OF THE AREA

02:12:01.913 --> 02:12:03.949
BE ABLE TO REDUCE- OF THE

02:12:04.016 --> 02:12:05.751
CARBON IN IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND

02:12:05.817 --> 02:12:07.653
I THINK TO MYSELF. WHY ARE WE

02:12:07.719 --> 02:12:08.720
SPENDING AS MUCH MONEY AS WE

02:12:08.787 --> 02:12:09.988
POSSIBLY CAN IN TRYING TO SUCK

02:12:10.055 --> 02:12:11.390
THE CARBON DIRECTLY. OUT OF THE

02:12:11.456 --> 02:12:12.624
ATMOSPHERE BUT YOU ADDRESSED

02:12:12.691 --> 02:12:13.592
THAT A LITTLE BIT IN YOUR

02:12:13.659 --> 02:12:15.193
OPENING. A SUGGESTING THAT

02:12:15.260 --> 02:12:16.528
MAYBE THAT MIGHT BE OF A FAIRY

02:12:16.595 --> 02:12:18.363
TALE IF I HEARD YOU CORRECTLY

02:12:18.430 --> 02:12:20.465
THAT MIGHT THAT MIGHT BE. A

02:12:20.532 --> 02:12:26.038
FAIRY TALE OF THAT WE. BE ABLE.

02:12:26.104 --> 02:12:28.807
AND TO THINK THAT WAS. THE

02:12:28.874 --> 02:12:30.342
ANSWER SO I GUESS THE ONE. IS

02:12:30.409 --> 02:12:31.043
IS THE HOPE. WHAT WE DO HAVE WE

02:12:31.109 --> 02:12:31.610
HAVE A- ECONOMY AT THE SAME

02:12:31.677 --> 02:12:32.411
TIME. A RETREAT. THIS NEGATIVE

02:12:32.477 --> 02:12:35.647
EXTERNALITY- AND- AND SOLVE

02:12:35.714 --> 02:12:38.317
THIS CRISIS. I THINK THAT THE

02:12:38.383 --> 02:12:39.318
FIRST ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IS

02:12:39.384 --> 02:12:40.118
BY HAVING AN HONEST

02:12:40.185 --> 02:12:41.219
CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT'S GOING

02:12:41.286 --> 02:12:42.387
ON THAT INCLUDES THE EQUITY

02:12:42.454 --> 02:12:43.655
CONSIDERATIONS INCLUDING

02:12:43.722 --> 02:12:45.490
GEOGRAPHIC CONSIDERATIONS THAT.

02:12:45.557 --> 02:12:48.260
THAT I HEARD FROM BOTH YOU. AND

02:12:48.327 --> 02:12:50.028
ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE- TWO

02:12:50.095 --> 02:12:51.630
THINGS TO SAY. ONE I'M ACTUALLY

02:12:51.697 --> 02:12:53.298
ACTUALLY ON THE VERY OPTIMISTIC

02:12:53.365 --> 02:12:54.766
SIDE OF THE DIRECTOR CAPTURE

02:12:54.833 --> 02:12:56.301
SPECTRUM. I THINK THERE'S SOME

02:12:56.368 --> 02:12:57.636
REALLY INTERESTING STUFF GOING

02:12:57.703 --> 02:12:59.171
ON AND IT COULD POTENTIALLY BE

02:12:59.237 --> 02:13:00.539
A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE WAY

02:13:00.605 --> 02:13:02.541
WE TACKLE THESE PROBLEMS- YOU

02:13:02.607 --> 02:13:04.509
ARE NOT. I DON'T THINK GOING TO

02:13:04.576 --> 02:13:05.811
BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN. THE

02:13:05.877 --> 02:13:07.779
CURRENT. STATUS AND STRUCTURE

02:13:07.846 --> 02:13:10.349
OF HOW. WE DRIVE CARS AND THE

02:13:10.415 --> 02:13:12.217
KINDS OF CARS WE DRIVE IT'S NOT

02:13:12.284 --> 02:13:14.920
SUSTAINABLE IN THE LONG RUN- SO

02:13:14.986 --> 02:13:15.854
DIRECTOR CAPTURES IN THE

02:13:15.921 --> 02:13:16.988
QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT WE

02:13:17.055 --> 02:13:18.223
HAVE TO COME UP WITH THE FOUR

02:13:18.290 --> 02:13:19.658
DOUBLE AN EQUITABLE SOLUTIONS

02:13:19.725 --> 02:13:20.959
BOTH TO HOUSING AND THE

02:13:21.026 --> 02:13:22.627
TRANSPORTATION COSTS THAT YOU

02:13:22.694 --> 02:13:23.962
SITE. BUT IT COULD BE A BIG

02:13:24.029 --> 02:13:25.330
PART OF WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.

02:13:25.397 --> 02:13:26.965
THE PROBLEM IS YOU HAVE LIKE

02:13:27.032 --> 02:13:28.500
TWO DEMONSTRATION FACILITIES IN

02:13:28.567 --> 02:13:30.235
ICELAND RIGHT NOW AND MOST OF

02:13:30.302 --> 02:13:31.403
THE DEPLOYMENT THAT IS BEING

02:13:31.470 --> 02:13:32.971
CONSIDERED. TO TEST THESE

02:13:33.038 --> 02:13:34.339
SYSTEMS AT SCALE. IS ABOUT

02:13:34.406 --> 02:13:35.674
PRODUCING MORE OIL AND GAS

02:13:35.741 --> 02:13:36.842
RATHER THAN DIRECTLY

02:13:36.908 --> 02:13:38.410
SEQUESTERING CO TWO AN

02:13:38.477 --> 02:13:39.511
UNDERGROUND STORAGE RESERVOIRS

02:13:39.578 --> 02:13:40.879
MOUNTED ON THE GAS PRODUCTION

02:13:40.946 --> 02:13:43.014
PURPOSE. SO I COULDN'T BE MORE

02:13:43.081 --> 02:13:44.516
OPTIMISTIC WORK VERY CLOSELY

02:13:44.583 --> 02:13:45.951
WITH COMPANIES. THAT ARE

02:13:46.017 --> 02:13:46.785
THINKING ABOUT INVESTING IN

02:13:46.852 --> 02:13:48.687
THESE ISSUES. AND WORKING

02:13:48.754 --> 02:13:49.788
SPECIFICALLY WITH THE COMPANIES

02:13:49.855 --> 02:13:50.956
YOU MENTIONED THERE'S A LOT OF

02:13:51.022 --> 02:13:53.392
GOOD STUFF HAPPENING- THAT IS

02:13:53.458 --> 02:13:54.893
NOT AN ANSWER. TO THE QUESTION

02:13:54.960 --> 02:13:56.595
OF HOW WE HANDLE TRANSPORTATION

02:13:56.661 --> 02:13:59.164
SECTOR EMISSIONS. SO IN LAST

02:13:59.231 --> 02:14:00.532
FOR OTHER ISSUES OKAY. AGAIN

02:14:00.599 --> 02:14:02.501
THE BIG EXASPERATION HEARING IS

02:14:02.567 --> 02:14:03.802
IF WE INDULGE IN FANTASY

02:14:03.869 --> 02:14:05.637
THINKING WE WILL SCREW THIS UP.

02:14:05.704 --> 02:14:07.472
BUT I HOPE SENATOR SKINNER

02:14:07.539 --> 02:14:09.307
REMEMBER ME WHICH SHE BEGAN.

02:14:09.374 --> 02:14:11.743
HER INNOVATIVE ADVOCACY. WELL

02:14:11.810 --> 02:14:12.644
BEFORE HER TIME IN THE

02:14:12.711 --> 02:14:13.979
LEGISLATURE. I THINK ANYBODY

02:14:14.045 --> 02:14:14.980
THOUGHT RENEWABLES ARE GOING TO

02:14:15.046 --> 02:14:16.281
BE AS CHEAP AS THEY ARE. IT IS

02:14:16.348 --> 02:14:17.849
REMARKABLE HOW QUICKLY THE

02:14:17.916 --> 02:14:19.718
ELECTRICITY SECTOR HAS STARTED

02:14:19.785 --> 02:14:21.086
TO MOVE. ON RENEWABLE ENERGY

02:14:21.153 --> 02:14:23.021
AND I THINK STORAGE. AND THE

02:14:23.088 --> 02:14:24.923
PACE OF ELECTRIC VEHICLE

02:14:24.990 --> 02:14:26.191
INNOVATION IS JUST OUT OF

02:14:26.258 --> 02:14:29.294
CONTROL IN A POSITIVE WAY THAT-

02:14:29.361 --> 02:14:30.762
MY GREAT HOPE IS THAT. IN A FEW

02:14:30.829 --> 02:14:31.797
YEARS WE WILL BE HAVING A

02:14:31.863 --> 02:14:33.732
CONVERSATION ABOUT. WHETHER OR

02:14:33.799 --> 02:14:38.303
NOT THERE ARE EFFORT. YOUR COST

02:14:38.370 --> 02:14:39.070
BARRIERS FOR FOLKS WHO ARE

02:14:39.137 --> 02:14:39.938
LIVING FAR AWAY FROM CENTERS TO

02:14:40.005 --> 02:14:42.140
DOCTOR. THE BE SHORT. IN OUR-

02:14:42.207 --> 02:14:42.774
TO GET ENOUGH KERR TO PEOPLE AS

02:14:42.841 --> 02:14:45.277
QUICKLY AS THEY WANT THEM-

02:14:45.343 --> 02:14:46.178
THAT'S HOPE. AND I AM REALLY

02:14:46.244 --> 02:14:47.646
EXCITED ABOUT THE ELECTRICITY

02:14:47.712 --> 02:14:49.381
SYSTEM AND THE TRANSPORTATION

02:14:49.448 --> 02:14:51.349
SYSTEM IN THE MEDIUM TERM. WHAT

02:14:51.416 --> 02:14:53.752
I'M WORRIED ABOUT IS. TALKING

02:14:53.819 --> 02:14:55.086
ABOUT. THE IDEA THAT WE ARE ON

02:14:55.153 --> 02:14:56.755
TRACK FOR CUTTING OR POLLUTION

02:14:56.822 --> 02:14:58.423
BY 40% IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS

02:14:58.490 --> 02:14:59.758
WITHOUT STEPPING UP THE PACE OF

02:14:59.825 --> 02:15:02.194
MEDICATION POLICIES- AND I'M

02:15:02.260 --> 02:15:03.094
I'M WORRIED IF WE DON'T HAVE

02:15:03.161 --> 02:15:04.162
HONEST CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

02:15:04.229 --> 02:15:05.630
THESE THINGS. WE WON'T BE ABLE

02:15:05.697 --> 02:15:06.898
TO BALANCE THE EQUITY AND

02:15:06.965 --> 02:15:08.400
GEOGRAPHIC CONSIDERATIONS THAT

02:15:08.467 --> 02:15:10.068
HAVE TO BE A PART OF THIS LONG

02:15:10.135 --> 02:15:12.070
TERM THINKING. SO PLEASED TO

02:15:12.137 --> 02:15:13.572
HEAR ME AS SOMEBODY WHO IS

02:15:13.638 --> 02:15:14.973
DEEPLY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT SOME

02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:17.442
<u>&lt;c.green&gt;ASES OF THOSE. ALSO SO&lt;/c&gt;</u>

02:15:17.509 --> 02:15:19.678
INCREDIBLY CONCERNED ABOUT. THE

02:15:19.744 --> 02:15:22.147
MAGICAL THINKING THAT I SEE- IN

02:15:22.214 --> 02:15:23.348
MANY CONVERSATIONS NOT

02:15:23.415 --> 02:15:24.883
EXCLUSIVE TO THE CALIFORNIA

02:15:24.950 --> 02:15:27.586
POLICY SITUATION BUT DEFINITELY

02:15:27.652 --> 02:15:31.756
PRESENT HERE AS WELL.

02:15:31.823 --> 02:15:33.492
GENERALITY I LOVE TO GET YOUR

02:15:33.558 --> 02:15:34.593
PERSONAL THINGS AGAIN I I'VE

02:15:34.659 --> 02:15:35.594
GOTTEN A CHANCE TO HEAR YOUR

02:15:35.660 --> 02:15:36.862
THOUGHTS AS THEY'VE EVOLVED

02:15:36.928 --> 02:15:38.363
OVER THE YEARS AND I ALWAYS

02:15:38.430 --> 02:15:40.799
APPRECIATE YOUR CANDOR AND- AND

02:15:40.866 --> 02:15:44.202
REAL TALK- I LOVE TO GET YOUR

02:15:44.269 --> 02:15:47.405
THOUGHTS. ON THE- EVER EVOLVING

02:15:47.472 --> 02:15:49.741
DISCUSSION OVER THE EXTENT TO

02:15:49.808 --> 02:15:52.177
WHICH WE REALLY- DOUBLE DOWN ON

02:15:52.244 --> 02:15:54.279
ELECTRIFICATION VERSUS OTHER

02:15:54.346 --> 02:15:55.547
ALTERNATIVE FUELS AND THAT'S

02:15:55.614 --> 02:15:57.048
OBVIOUSLY A BIG BATTLE THAT

02:15:57.115 --> 02:16:00.285
THAT TAKES PLACE HERE- YOU KNOW

02:16:00.352 --> 02:16:01.586
MONKS AMONGST PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:16:01.653 --> 02:16:03.655
PUSHING FOR EVERYTHING FROM

02:16:03.722 --> 02:16:06.324
HYDROGEN TO. NATURAL GAS AND

02:16:06.391 --> 02:16:10.495
IT'S AFTER. SENATOR ARE YOU

02:16:10.562 --> 02:16:11.429
ASKING WITH RESPECT TO THE

02:16:11.496 --> 02:16:12.597
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR

02:16:12.664 --> 02:16:16.434
ADVERTISING SECTOR I'M SORRY. I

02:16:16.501 --> 02:16:17.369
THINK THERE ARE OTHERS WHO ARE

02:16:17.435 --> 02:16:28.146
PROBABLY. HAVE DEEPER EXPERTISE

02:16:28.213 --> 02:16:29.014
ON THIS ISSUE WHEN I TO WHO ARE

02:16:29.080 --> 02:16:29.948
SERIOUS EXPERT IN THE SPACE. I

02:16:30.015 --> 02:16:31.249
DON'T. MUCH INTO THE FOR NOW

02:16:31.316 --> 02:16:33.485
ELECT STRATEGY IN THE DUTY ARE

02:16:33.552 --> 02:16:34.519
AND I HEAR A ROBE DEBATE. FOR

02:16:34.586 --> 02:16:36.321
HAVING VEHICLE BEEN TRY SPACE

02:16:36.388 --> 02:16:37.756
AND- I AM NOT ENOUGH OF THE

02:16:37.822 --> 02:16:40.258
EXPERT TO SAVE YOU. I'M TO PUT

02:16:40.325 --> 02:16:41.459
MY FINGER IN THE AIR ANSWERED

02:16:41.526 --> 02:16:42.961
GASSET THAT'S ALL GOING TO GO

02:16:43.028 --> 02:16:44.362
THE FALLING COST OF BATTERIES

02:16:44.429 --> 02:16:45.964
AND THE RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL

02:16:46.031 --> 02:16:50.302
INNOVATIONS THAT SPACE HAS

02:16:50.368 --> 02:16:50.869
OPENED UP POSSIBILITIES THAT

02:16:50.936 --> 02:16:52.637
SEEMED. LESS LIKELY A COUPLE OF

02:16:52.704 --> 02:16:55.173
YEARS AGO- I'M ALSO WATCHING

02:16:55.240 --> 02:16:57.375
CAREFULLY I THINK. YOU KNOW IF

02:16:57.442 --> 02:16:58.243
WE WATCH CAREFULLY

02:16:58.310 --> 02:16:59.611
CONVERSATIONS IN EUROPE AND THE

02:16:59.678 --> 02:17:01.246
UNITED KINGDOM FOCUS MORE ON

02:17:01.313 --> 02:17:02.881
HYDROGEN IN VARIOUS PARTS OF

02:17:02.948 --> 02:17:04.449
THE LONG TERM DECARBONISATION

02:17:04.516 --> 02:17:06.384
BY THAN WE HAVE THUS FAR TALKED

02:17:06.451 --> 02:17:08.720
ABOUT IN CALIFORNIA- I TRY TO

02:17:08.787 --> 02:17:09.854
BE AGNOSTIC ABOUT THESE THINGS

02:17:09.921 --> 02:17:12.123
BUT- THE- MAIN MESSAGE I'M

02:17:12.190 --> 02:17:13.558
HEARING FROM COLLEAGUES WHO.

02:17:13.625 --> 02:17:14.826
CONCENTRATE ON THE CERES THAT

02:17:14.893 --> 02:17:17.629
LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES THE CARS

02:17:17.696 --> 02:17:18.229
AND TRUCKS THAT REGULAR PEOPLE

02:17:18.296 --> 02:17:20.165
DRIVE. THE ELECTRIC DRIVE TRAIN

02:17:20.231 --> 02:17:21.399
IS WHERE THE ACTION IS GOING TO

02:17:21.466 --> 02:17:22.834
BE THERE. AND WHEN YOU MOVE

02:17:22.901 --> 02:17:24.369
INTO THE HAVE YOUR TUTOR DUTY

02:17:24.436 --> 02:17:26.204
VEHICLES THERE ARE. ROBUST

02:17:26.271 --> 02:17:27.906
DEBATES ABOUT THE EXACT PATH

02:17:27.973 --> 02:17:30.008
FORWARD. BUT WHEN YOU SEE CRAZY

02:17:30.075 --> 02:17:31.843
THINGS LIKE PEOPLE FIGURED OUT

02:17:31.910 --> 02:17:34.012
HOW TO ELECTRIFY YOU KNOW. LIKE

02:17:34.079 --> 02:17:35.380
SHIPPING BARGES LIKE SOME OF

02:17:35.447 --> 02:17:37.749
THE BARGE BASED TRANSPORTATION

02:17:37.816 --> 02:17:39.417
ON THE OCEANS LIKE PEOPLE ARE

02:17:39.484 --> 02:17:41.086
ELECTRIFYING THINGS THAT. DID

02:17:41.152 --> 02:17:42.554
NOT SEEM POSSIBLE SEVERAL YEARS

02:17:42.621 --> 02:17:44.255
AGO AND IT'S JUST IT'S

02:17:44.322 --> 02:17:45.690
FASCINATING TO WATCH. THE

02:17:45.757 --> 02:17:46.791
DEGREE TO WHICH GIVE LIKE- YOU

02:17:46.858 --> 02:17:48.093
YOU COULD TURN THAT INTO AN

02:17:48.159 --> 02:17:49.995
ELECTRIC APPLICATIONS WELL THAT

02:17:50.061 --> 02:17:50.929
SEEMS TO BE PLAYING OUT IN

02:17:50.996 --> 02:17:53.665
PLACES. TEN YEARS AGO I NEVER

02:17:53.732 --> 02:17:59.904
WOULD HAVE IMAGINED. ALL RIGHT

02:17:59.971 --> 02:18:01.640
THANK YOU SEEING NO FURTHER

02:18:01.706 --> 02:18:04.109
QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH

02:18:04.175 --> 02:18:06.311
DR COLIN WARD. THANK YOU FOR

02:18:06.378 --> 02:18:11.249
YOUR TIME. LAST BIGGER ON THIS

02:18:11.316 --> 02:18:15.520
PANEL IS- DR MEREDITH VALLEY

02:18:15.587 --> 02:18:17.822
SHE IS AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR

02:18:17.889 --> 02:18:22.160
AT UC BERKELEY- FIRST VALLEY.

02:18:22.227 --> 02:18:23.428
THANK YOU CAN YOU HEAR ME OK

02:18:23.495 --> 02:18:25.764
YES THANK YOU GREAT THANK YOU

02:18:25.830 --> 02:18:27.165
AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE

02:18:27.232 --> 02:18:28.566
OPPORTUNITY TO BE PART OF THIS

02:18:28.633 --> 02:18:30.835
CONVERSATION I AM A UC BERKELEY

02:18:30.902 --> 02:18:32.837
ECONOMIST HYMAN DEPARTMENT OF

02:18:32.904 --> 02:18:34.239
AGRICULTURE RESOURCE ECONOMICS

02:18:34.305 --> 02:18:35.807
AND FACULTY DIRECTOR OF THE

02:18:35.874 --> 02:18:38.276
ENERGY IS CHEATED HAAS SO MY

02:18:38.343 --> 02:18:40.378
EXPERTISE- THIS IS RELATIVELY

02:18:40.445 --> 02:18:42.514
NARROW- LOOKING AT- THE

02:18:42.580 --> 02:18:45.150
ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC

02:18:45.216 --> 02:18:46.584
REGULATION OF ENERGY MARKETS.

02:18:46.651 --> 02:18:48.553
AND GIVEN THE URGENCY OF THE

02:18:48.620 --> 02:18:50.255
CLIMATE CHANGE PROBLEM I REALLY

02:18:50.321 --> 02:18:52.023
APPRECIATE THAT TODAY'S SESSION

02:18:52.090 --> 02:18:53.792
IS NOT ASKING WHETHER

02:18:53.858 --> 02:18:55.560
CALIFORNIA SHOULD ACT BUT WHAT

02:18:55.627 --> 02:18:56.861
PATH TO TAKE WHICH POLICY

02:18:56.928 --> 02:18:59.030
LEVERS TO PULL. AND HOW SWIFTLY

02:18:59.097 --> 02:18:59.964
TO MOVE THE WORLD'S FIFTH

02:19:00.031 --> 02:19:01.766
LARGEST ECONOMY ONTO A MORE

02:19:01.833 --> 02:19:03.902
SUSTAINABLE PATH. IT'S LATE AND

02:19:03.968 --> 02:19:05.570
I KNOW I'VE MY TIME IS LIMITED

02:19:05.637 --> 02:19:06.371
SO I'M JUST GOING TO TRY AND

02:19:06.438 --> 02:19:07.772
MAKE THREE POINTS ALL STATE

02:19:07.839 --> 02:19:09.607
THEM UP FRONT AND THEN. EXPAND

02:19:09.674 --> 02:19:12.143
AS TIME PERMITS SO THE FIRST

02:19:12.210 --> 02:19:14.713
POINT IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S NET

02:19:14.779 --> 02:19:16.314
ZERO GOAL IS A MEANS TO AN END

02:19:16.381 --> 02:19:18.016
NOT AN END TO ITSELF AND I KNOW

02:19:18.083 --> 02:19:19.184
WHO THE COMMITTEE APPRECIATE

02:19:19.250 --> 02:19:21.019
FAST BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

02:19:21.086 --> 02:19:21.553
TO KEEP IN MIND THAT OUR

02:19:21.619 --> 02:19:23.455
GUIDING PRINCIPLE. SHOULD BE TO

02:19:23.521 --> 02:19:26.124
INNOVATE AND DEMONSTRATE-

02:19:26.191 --> 02:19:27.592
TECHNOLOGY THE POLICIES THAT

02:19:27.659 --> 02:19:28.727
CAN BE EXPORTED TO OTHER

02:19:28.793 --> 02:19:30.295
JURISDICTIONS FOR THE VAST

02:19:30.361 --> 02:19:32.263
MAJORITY OF PROJECTED TO FUTURE

02:19:32.330 --> 02:19:33.698
GREENHOUSE GASES ARE ARE

02:19:33.765 --> 02:19:36.134
EXPECTED TO HAPPEN. MY SECOND

02:19:36.201 --> 02:19:37.569
POINT IS THAT IT'S NOT JUST

02:19:37.635 --> 02:19:39.104
WHAT WE DO BUT HOW WE DO IT

02:19:39.170 --> 02:19:40.939
THAT MATTERS SO IN PARTICULAR

02:19:41.005 --> 02:19:43.074
IF WE WANT TO ENSURE A CLEAN

02:19:43.141 --> 02:19:44.275
ENERGY TRANSITION THAT

02:19:44.342 --> 02:19:46.411
EQUITABLE AND AFFORDABLE. WE

02:19:46.478 --> 02:19:47.545
NEED INNOVATION ACROSS THE

02:19:47.612 --> 02:19:49.814
BOARDS OF COURSE WE NEED NEW

02:19:49.881 --> 02:19:51.182
TECHNOLOGIES WE NEED

02:19:51.249 --> 02:19:52.784
INFRASTRUCTURE MODERNIZATION

02:19:52.851 --> 02:19:54.586
BUT IT'S ALSO GOING TO REQUIRE

02:19:54.652 --> 02:19:55.987
REINVENTING THE INSTITUTIONAL

02:19:56.054 --> 02:19:58.323
AND REGULATORY STRUCTURES. THAT

02:19:58.389 --> 02:20:00.091
GUIDE WHICH INVESTMENTS WE MAKE

02:20:00.158 --> 02:20:01.793
HOW WE PAY FOR THEM AND WHO

02:20:01.860 --> 02:20:03.495
ULTIMATELY PAYS THE PRICE. AND

02:20:03.561 --> 02:20:05.163
FINALLY- AND THIS IS PICKING UP

02:20:05.230 --> 02:20:06.664
ANYTHING THAT'S COME UP ALREADY

02:20:06.731 --> 02:20:09.667
THERE'S A TEMPTATION TO MANDATE

02:20:09.734 --> 02:20:12.036
OUR WAY TO THE ZERO CARBON- AND

02:20:12.103 --> 02:20:14.439
THIS COULD UNDERMINE- THE ROLE

02:20:14.506 --> 02:20:15.440
OF CALIFORNIA'S CARBON MARKET

02:20:15.507 --> 02:20:16.674
IN THE COST EFFECTIVENESS IT

02:20:16.741 --> 02:20:18.309
BRINGS WE DON'T KNOW THE PATH

02:20:18.376 --> 02:20:19.711
FROM HERE TO THERE. THAT'S

02:20:19.778 --> 02:20:21.579
GOING TO DEPEND ON INNOVATION

02:20:21.646 --> 02:20:23.381
AND TO BE DETERMINED ADVANCES

02:20:23.448 --> 02:20:24.582
AND SO AN IMPORTANT ADVANTAGE

02:20:24.649 --> 02:20:26.050
OF A CARBON MARKET IS IT

02:20:26.117 --> 02:20:27.452
PROVIDES A WAY TO INCENTIVIZE

02:20:27.519 --> 02:20:29.320
THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE-

02:20:29.387 --> 02:20:30.655
MEASURES WITHOUT REALLY KNOWING

02:20:30.722 --> 02:20:33.725
WHERE OR- HOW THEY CAN THAT.

02:20:33.792 --> 02:20:37.395
THEY. CAN MANIFEST OR CAN BE

02:20:37.462 --> 02:20:39.130
FOUND. SO FIRST POINT. IN THE

02:20:39.197 --> 02:20:40.465
PROJECTIONS ARE THAT GLOBAL

02:20:40.532 --> 02:20:41.766
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ARE

02:20:41.833 --> 02:20:43.535
GOING TO REACH SIXTY FIVE GIGA

02:20:43.601 --> 02:20:45.103
TONNES UNDER BUSINESS AS USUAL

02:20:45.170 --> 02:20:46.604
BY TWENTY THIRTY. OUR

02:20:46.671 --> 02:20:48.406
CALIFORNIA INVENTORY IS

02:20:48.473 --> 02:20:50.275
ESTIMATING TWENTY NINETEEN

02:20:50.341 --> 02:20:51.309
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AT

02:20:51.376 --> 02:20:53.178
JUST OVER POINT FOUR GIGA TONS

02:20:53.244 --> 02:20:55.346
SO. EVEN IF WE ZERO OUT OUR

02:20:55.413 --> 02:20:57.248
CALIFORNIA EMISSIONS WOULD

02:20:57.315 --> 02:20:58.316
REDUCE PROJECTED GLOBAL

02:20:58.383 --> 02:21:00.084
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY.

02:21:00.151 --> 02:21:01.920
POINT SEVEN PERCENT. AND THIS

02:21:01.986 --> 02:21:03.221
IS NOT TO SUGGEST THAT

02:21:03.288 --> 02:21:04.923
CALIFORNIA'S DECARBONIZATION

02:21:04.989 --> 02:21:06.558
EFFORTS ARE FEW TILE BUT RATHER

02:21:06.624 --> 02:21:08.359
TO UNDERSCORE THE FACT. THAT

02:21:08.426 --> 02:21:09.794
THE REASON WE'RE HERE TODAY IS

02:21:09.861 --> 02:21:10.461
TO MOVE THE GLOBAL BALL

02:21:10.528 --> 02:21:12.564
FORWARD. NEVER GOING TO MAKE A

02:21:12.630 --> 02:21:13.464
DENT IN THE CLIMATE CHANGE

02:21:13.531 --> 02:21:14.299
PROBLEM IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN

02:21:14.365 --> 02:21:15.400
THROUGH LEADERSHIP AND

02:21:15.466 --> 02:21:16.434
DEMONSTRATING THE MOST

02:21:16.501 --> 02:21:18.603
PROMISING CLIMATE SOLUTIONS. SO

02:21:18.670 --> 02:21:19.938
THIS IS TRUE FOR TECHNOLOGY

02:21:20.004 --> 02:21:21.639
INNOVATION AND MANY FIRMS IN

02:21:21.706 --> 02:21:23.675
CALIFORNIA ARE WELL. POSITIONED

02:21:23.741 --> 02:21:25.009
TO CAPITALIZE ON THAT SO IN

02:21:25.076 --> 02:21:26.377
THAT RESPECT I THINK INCENTIVES

02:21:26.444 --> 02:21:28.479
ARE RELATIVELY WELL ALIGNED.

02:21:28.546 --> 02:21:30.014
BUT IT'S ALSO TRUE FOR POLICY

02:21:30.081 --> 02:21:32.016
INNOVATION. AND I THINK IN SOME

02:21:32.083 --> 02:21:33.384
CASES THERE WILL BE TENSIONS

02:21:33.451 --> 02:21:34.886
BETWEEN THE PURSUIT A VERY

02:21:34.953 --> 02:21:37.322
AMBITIOUS STATE LEVEL TARGETS.

02:21:37.388 --> 02:21:39.357
AND FOCUSED EFFORTS TO CRAFTING

02:21:39.424 --> 02:21:40.758
DEMONSTRATE MODELS THEY CAN BE

02:21:40.825 --> 02:21:42.427
EXPORTED ELSEWHERE AND SO WHEN

02:21:42.493 --> 02:21:44.229
THAT WHERE THOSE TENSIONS ARISE

02:21:44.295 --> 02:21:45.163
I HOPE WE PRIORITIZE THE

02:21:45.230 --> 02:21:47.565
LATTER. I ALSO WANT TO PICK UP

02:21:47.632 --> 02:21:49.200
ON AN IMPORTANT POINT THAT ROSS

02:21:49.267 --> 02:21:51.402
BROWN MADE- IF WE WANT TO

02:21:51.469 --> 02:21:53.037
MAXIMIZE THE GLOBAL IMPACT OF

02:21:53.104 --> 02:21:54.806
OUR CLIMATE POLICY INNOVATION.

02:21:54.873 --> 02:21:56.274
WE SHOULD BE DOING MORE TO

02:21:56.341 --> 02:21:58.243
EXTRACT UNDERSTAND LESSONS THAT

02:21:58.309 --> 02:21:59.811
WE'RE LEARNING BY DOING SO

02:21:59.878 --> 02:22:03.014
OTHERS CAN FOLLOW- SO ROSS

02:22:03.081 --> 02:22:04.482
BROWN MADE REALLY ARTICULATE

02:22:04.549 --> 02:22:06.117
ARGUMENTS ALONG THOSE LINES I

02:22:06.184 --> 02:22:07.719
WANT TO ALSO DRAW YOUR

02:22:07.785 --> 02:22:08.519
ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT

02:22:08.586 --> 02:22:09.754
THERE'S PRECEDENT FOR DOING

02:22:09.821 --> 02:22:10.355
THIS DELIBERATELY AND

02:22:10.421 --> 02:22:12.790
EFFECTIVELY. SO QUICK EXAMPLE

02:22:12.857 --> 02:22:14.726
BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THE

02:22:14.792 --> 02:22:16.294
FEDERAL RECOVERY ACT INCLUDED

02:22:16.361 --> 02:22:19.163
BILLIONS. IN MATCHING FUNDS TO

02:22:19.230 --> 02:22:20.798
ACCELERATES MARKET INVESTMENTS.

02:22:20.865 --> 02:22:22.767
RECOGNIZING THAT THIS PRESENTED

02:22:22.834 --> 02:22:24.202
AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY LEARN

02:22:24.269 --> 02:22:25.770
ABOUT WHAT INVESTMENTS WORK IN

02:22:25.837 --> 02:22:27.772
WHICH FALL SHORT. THEY DO YOU

02:22:27.839 --> 02:22:29.707
REQUIRED GRANT RECIPIENTS

02:22:29.774 --> 02:22:31.175
DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT PROGRAM

02:22:31.242 --> 02:22:32.543
ABOUT AERATION PLANS THAT MET

02:22:32.610 --> 02:22:37.815
PREDETERMINED CRITERIA. SO I

02:22:37.882 --> 02:22:38.349
WAS FORTUNATE TO WORK WITH

02:22:38.416 --> 02:22:39.651
SMART ON THERE FROM INTO SMART

02:22:39.717 --> 02:22:41.052
GRID ELECT PRICE PROGRAM. AND

02:22:41.119 --> 02:22:42.153
THAT'S ABA. TO THINK ABOUT

02:22:42.220 --> 02:22:44.022
EVALUATION AS WE DESIGNED THE

02:22:44.088 --> 02:22:45.890
PROGRAMS MEANT THAT ONCE THE

02:22:45.957 --> 02:22:47.091
PROGRAMS ARE UP AND RUNNING WE

02:22:47.158 --> 02:22:48.226
HAD WHAT WE NEEDED TO

02:22:48.293 --> 02:22:49.761
RIGOROUSLY STUDY WHAT WAS

02:22:49.827 --> 02:22:51.029
WORKING AND WHAT WAS FALLING

02:22:51.095 --> 02:22:52.730
SHORT OF EXPECTATIONS. AND

02:22:52.797 --> 02:22:53.865
FINDINGS FROM THOSE STUDIES

02:22:53.932 --> 02:22:55.400
HAVE SINCE INFORMED AND SHAPED

02:22:55.466 --> 02:22:58.036
CQC'S DECISIONS INCLUDING SOME

02:22:58.102 --> 02:22:59.003
RECENT DECISIONS WHICH WILL

02:22:59.070 --> 02:23:00.338
REDUCE THE COST OF INTEGRATING

02:23:00.405 --> 02:23:01.572
HIGHER LEVELS OF RENEWABLE

02:23:01.639 --> 02:23:03.975
GENERATION. SO I SOME I THINK

02:23:04.042 --> 02:23:05.043
THAT CALIFORNIA'S POLICY

02:23:05.109 --> 02:23:06.511
EXPERIMENTATION CAN HAVE A

02:23:06.577 --> 02:23:07.912
GLOBAL IMPACT BUT TO REALIZE

02:23:07.979 --> 02:23:09.914
THAT POTENTIAL WE NEED TO FOCUS

02:23:09.981 --> 02:23:11.582
ON EXPORTABLE SOLUTIONS. AND

02:23:11.649 --> 02:23:12.684
IDEALLY INVEST MORE IN

02:23:12.750 --> 02:23:15.119
UNDERSTANDING HOW THIS

02:23:15.186 --> 02:23:16.454
EXPERIMENTATION IS WORKING. THE

02:23:16.521 --> 02:23:17.789
SECOND POINT I WANT TO MAKE I

02:23:17.855 --> 02:23:19.157
THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND

02:23:19.223 --> 02:23:21.025
IF WE TAKE ONE AWAY FROM HIM

02:23:21.092 --> 02:23:22.160
FROM THE CENTER AND THINGS COME

02:23:22.226 --> 02:23:23.795
UP THAT I HOPE WITH THIS ONE.

02:23:23.861 --> 02:23:25.730
IT'S ABOUT THE NEED FOR ENERGY

02:23:25.797 --> 02:23:27.699
SECTOR REFORM SO IT'S REALLY

02:23:27.765 --> 02:23:29.133
EXCITING TO THINK ABOUT THE NEW

02:23:29.200 --> 02:23:31.302
TECHNOLOGIES WE CAN DEPLOY. AND

02:23:31.369 --> 02:23:32.537
THE STEPS WE CAN TAKE TO FIGHT

02:23:32.603 --> 02:23:34.305
CLIMATE CHANGE SOMEWHAT LESS

02:23:34.372 --> 02:23:36.374
EXCITING WESTERN ECONOMIST- BUT

02:23:36.441 --> 02:23:37.675
NO LESS IMPORTANT IS TO THINK

02:23:37.742 --> 02:23:39.310
ABOUT HOW WE PAY FOR ALL THIS.

02:23:39.377 --> 02:23:40.979
SO HOW WE FUND OUR CLIMATE

02:23:41.045 --> 02:23:42.480
AMBITION IS GOING TO DETERMINE

02:23:42.547 --> 02:23:44.382
WHAT IT COST AND WHO PAYS THE

02:23:44.449 --> 02:23:45.883
PRICE. AND TO ELUCIDATE THIS

02:23:45.950 --> 02:23:47.418
POINT I WANT TO DRAW FROM SOME

02:23:47.485 --> 02:23:49.120
WORK I'M DOING WITH AND ENERGY

02:23:49.187 --> 02:23:50.421
INSTITUTE COLLEAGUES THAT

02:23:50.488 --> 02:23:52.156
INVESTIGATES WHY CALIFORNIA'S

02:23:52.223 --> 02:23:53.858
REGULATED RETAIL ELECTRICITY

02:23:53.925 --> 02:23:55.994
PRICES. SO THE PRICE WE ALL PAY

02:23:56.060 --> 02:23:56.961
PER KILOWATT HOUR FOR

02:23:57.028 --> 02:23:58.763
ELECTRICITY FROM THE GRID. OUR

02:23:58.830 --> 02:24:00.565
HIGH AND INCREASINGLY ALIGNED

02:24:00.631 --> 02:24:02.133
WITH THE REST OF THE COUNTRY

02:24:02.200 --> 02:24:03.434
HAS THE ANSWERS HAVE IMPORTANT

02:24:03.501 --> 02:24:06.337
IMPLICATIONS FOR THE

02:24:06.404 --> 02:24:07.005
CONVERSATION WE'RE HAVING TODAY.

02:24:07.071 --> 02:24:08.573
SO IF ECONOMY WITH OR DOES

02:24:08.639 --> 02:24:10.875
ELECTRO PRICES. I WOULD SET THE

02:24:10.942 --> 02:24:11.909
PRICE PER KILOWATT HOUR TO

02:24:11.976 --> 02:24:13.244
REFLECT THE MARGINAL SOCIAL

02:24:13.311 --> 02:24:15.013
COST OF CONSUMING ELECTRICITY

02:24:15.079 --> 02:24:16.414
SO WHEN I RUN MY DISHWASHER AND

02:24:16.481 --> 02:24:17.615
CONSUME A KILOWATT HOUR OF

02:24:17.682 --> 02:24:19.150
ELECTRICITY. THE PRICE TO

02:24:19.217 --> 02:24:20.451
REFLECT THE COST OF THE FUEL

02:24:20.518 --> 02:24:22.086
AND THE CLIMATE COST OF THAT

02:24:22.153 --> 02:24:23.855
INCREMENTAL CONSUMPTION. BUT

02:24:23.921 --> 02:24:25.123
WHAT WE'RE SHOWING IN OUR WORK

02:24:25.189 --> 02:24:26.491
IS THAT THE MARGINAL SOCIAL

02:24:26.557 --> 02:24:28.026
COST IS ARE EFFICIENT PRICE

02:24:28.092 --> 02:24:29.827
BENCHMARK FOR ELECTRICITY IF

02:24:29.894 --> 02:24:31.829
YOU WELL. HAS BEEN DECLINING IN

02:24:31.896 --> 02:24:33.531
CALIFORNIA HAS OUR GREAT GETS

02:24:33.598 --> 02:24:35.099
CLEANER SO WE'RE ESTIMATING

02:24:35.166 --> 02:24:36.968
THAT IN TWENTY NINETEEN. THIS

02:24:37.035 --> 02:24:38.870
EFFICIENT PRICES ABOUT EIGHT TO

02:24:38.936 --> 02:24:40.238
TEN CENTS PER KILOWATT HOUR.

02:24:40.304 --> 02:24:41.539
BUT THE RETAIL PRICES WERE

02:24:41.606 --> 02:24:43.441
PAYING ARE MUCH HIGHER SO IN MY

02:24:43.508 --> 02:24:45.676
TERRITORY. MOST CUSTOMERS PAY

02:24:45.743 --> 02:24:47.512
ABOUT THREE TIMES THAT. LOW

02:24:47.578 --> 02:24:49.013
INCOME CUSTOMERS WHO QUALIFY

02:24:49.080 --> 02:24:51.249
FOR THE CARE RATE HE TWO TIMES

02:24:51.315 --> 02:24:52.917
THAT EFFICIENT PRICE. AND THE

02:24:52.984 --> 02:24:53.851
REASON WE'RE PAYING AND

02:24:53.918 --> 02:24:54.852
EFFICIENTLY HYLEK CHRISTY

02:24:54.919 --> 02:24:58.423
PRICES. IF CALIFORNIA HAS A

02:24:58.489 --> 02:24:59.924
PRACTICE OF. SB CONSUMPTION TO

02:24:59.991 --> 02:25:01.893
THE REVENUES WE REALLY NEED FOR

02:25:01.959 --> 02:25:03.361
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS AND

02:25:03.428 --> 02:25:05.396
GRID MODERNIZATION AND WILDFIRE

02:25:05.463 --> 02:25:07.165
ADAPTATION. AND ROOFTOP SOLAR

02:25:07.231 --> 02:25:09.100
SUBSIDIES THE LIST GOES ON. WE

02:25:09.167 --> 02:25:11.536
HAVE A LOT OF THESE EXPENSES.

02:25:11.602 --> 02:25:12.403
PARTLY PREVENT MITIGATE CLIMATE

02:25:12.470 --> 02:25:14.105
CHANGE. PARTLY BECAUSE WE'RE

02:25:14.172 --> 02:25:14.906
TRYING TO ADAPT TO CLIMATE

02:25:14.972 --> 02:25:16.774
CHANGE. THESE COSTS ARE ONLY

02:25:16.841 --> 02:25:18.276
GOING TO ESCALATE. AND SO

02:25:18.342 --> 02:25:20.178
HERE'S MY KEY POINT RECOVERING

02:25:20.244 --> 02:25:21.712
THESE COSTS IN ELECTRICITY

02:25:21.779 --> 02:25:23.014
RATES TAXING ELECTRICITY

02:25:23.081 --> 02:25:25.083
CONSUMPTION IS PROBLEMATIC FOR

02:25:25.149 --> 02:25:26.784
TWO REASONS. ONE AS WE'VE

02:25:26.851 --> 02:25:28.453
DISCUSSED ELECTRIFICATION IS A

02:25:28.519 --> 02:25:31.189
KEY TO THE DECARBONISATION. HI

02:25:31.255 --> 02:25:32.190
ELECTRICITY PRICES ARE GONNA

02:25:32.256 --> 02:25:33.424
SLOW PROGRESS ON

02:25:33.491 --> 02:25:35.526
ELECTRIFICATION. SO IN CARP

02:25:35.593 --> 02:25:37.061
SCOPES OUT THAT WE NEED X.

02:25:37.128 --> 02:25:38.896
PERCENT OF ELECTRIC CARS BY

02:25:38.963 --> 02:25:40.898
TWENTY THIRTY. WE NEED DRIVERS

02:25:40.965 --> 02:25:42.133
TO CHOOSE TO GET INTO ELECTRIC

02:25:42.200 --> 02:25:43.901
CARS AND RESEARCH SHOWS THAT

02:25:43.968 --> 02:25:45.903
IT'S MUCH HARDER. TO PROMOTE

02:25:45.970 --> 02:25:46.904
ELECTRIFICATION WHEN

02:25:46.971 --> 02:25:48.539
ELECTRICITY PRICES ARE HIGH AND

02:25:48.606 --> 02:25:50.741
RISING. AND THE SECOND REASON

02:25:50.808 --> 02:25:52.310
TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT A TAX ON

02:25:52.376 --> 02:25:53.845
ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION IS ONE

02:25:53.911 --> 02:25:55.646
OF THE MOST REGRESSIVE TAXES WE

02:25:55.713 --> 02:25:57.081
CAN THINK OF. BECAUSE LOW

02:25:57.148 --> 02:26:02.086
INCOME. THIS IS MARCUS OF THAT

02:26:02.153 --> 02:26:04.322
GAS TAX A SALES TAX MUCH MORE

02:26:04.388 --> 02:26:06.357
AGGRESSIVE THAN IN INCOME TAX.

02:26:06.424 --> 02:26:07.158
SO WE'RE THINKING ABOUT

02:26:07.225 --> 02:26:08.693
DECARBONISING THE CALIFORNIA

02:26:08.759 --> 02:26:10.628
ECONOMY IT'S CLEAR WE NEED TO

02:26:10.695 --> 02:26:12.296
REVOLUTIONIZE HOW WE GENERATE

02:26:12.363 --> 02:26:13.331
ELECTRICITY AND PUBLIC

02:26:13.397 --> 02:26:14.499
TRANSPORT ELECTRICITY AND HOW

02:26:14.565 --> 02:26:16.400
WE CONSUME ELECTRICITY. BUT WE

02:26:16.467 --> 02:26:17.835
ALSO NEED TO RETHINK HOW WE PAY

02:26:17.902 --> 02:26:19.904
FOR ELECTRICITY FOR BOTH EQUITY

02:26:19.971 --> 02:26:21.739
AND EFFICIENCY REASONS. I KNOW

02:26:21.806 --> 02:26:22.874
I'M AT A TIME LET ME MAKE MY

02:26:22.940 --> 02:26:24.108
FINAL POINT BRIEFLY WE'VE

02:26:24.175 --> 02:26:26.077
ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THIS. BUT

02:26:26.144 --> 02:26:27.044
WITH RESPECT TO THE CARBON

02:26:27.111 --> 02:26:29.013
MARKET CARBON PRICING IS NOT A

02:26:29.080 --> 02:26:30.281
SILVER BULLET BUT IT'S AN

02:26:30.348 --> 02:26:32.049
ESSENTIAL PIECE OF CALIFORNIA'S

02:26:32.116 --> 02:26:34.218
CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES. SO WE

02:26:34.285 --> 02:26:35.887
HAVEN'T PLACED AN ECONOMY WIDE

02:26:35.953 --> 02:26:37.688
CARBON MARKET WHICH ENSURES

02:26:37.755 --> 02:26:39.357
THAT SOME PART I'D LIKE TO SEE

02:26:39.423 --> 02:26:40.858
THE PRICE BE HIGHER BUT SOME

02:26:40.925 --> 02:26:42.426
PART OF THE COST OF EMITTING

02:26:42.493 --> 02:26:43.961
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. IS

02:26:44.028 --> 02:26:45.563
TRANSMITTED IN THE FORM OF A

02:26:45.630 --> 02:26:47.098
CARBON PRICE ALMOST EVERYWHERE.

02:26:47.165 --> 02:26:48.799
CARBON IS IMPLICITLY BOUGHT AND

02:26:48.866 --> 02:26:50.168
SOLD SERVICE PROVIDES AN

02:26:50.234 --> 02:26:52.270
INCENTIVE. FOR AGENTS TO

02:26:52.336 --> 02:26:53.104
INTERNALIZE PART OF THE CLIMATE

02:26:53.171 --> 02:26:55.740
COST. IF WE RELY PRIMARILY ON

02:26:55.806 --> 02:26:57.041
MANDATES AND STANDARDS AND

02:26:57.108 --> 02:26:58.476
SUBSIDIES TO ACHIEVE OUR FUTURE

02:26:58.543 --> 02:27:00.945
TARGETS WILL DEPRESSOR DILUTE

02:27:01.012 --> 02:27:02.280
THIS CARBON PRICING ALSO I

02:27:02.346 --> 02:27:03.181
THINK THERE'S A BALANCE TO

02:27:03.247 --> 02:27:04.916
STRIKE. BETWEEN RELYING ON THE

02:27:04.982 --> 02:27:06.184
CARBON MARKET VERSUS

02:27:06.250 --> 02:27:07.585
PRESCRIPTIVE REGULATIONS TO GET

02:27:07.652 --> 02:27:09.220
WHERE WE NEED TO GO. SO I'VE

02:27:09.287 --> 02:27:10.354
ONLY SCRATCHED THE SURFACE I'M

02:27:10.421 --> 02:27:12.223
WAY OVER TIME I WILL CLOSE BY

02:27:12.290 --> 02:27:13.824
SAYING THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF

02:27:13.891 --> 02:27:14.692
RESEARCHERS STUDENTS AND

02:27:14.759 --> 02:27:16.761
FACULTY. AT UC BERKELEY DOING

02:27:16.827 --> 02:27:18.029
RESEARCH RELEVANT TO THE THREE

02:27:18.095 --> 02:27:19.697
THINGS I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT.

02:27:19.764 --> 02:27:21.199
AN IMPORTANT MOTIVATION THIS

02:27:21.265 --> 02:27:22.633
WORK IS TO INFORM HIGH STAKES

02:27:22.700 --> 02:27:24.936
POLICY DECISIONS SO PLEASE DO

02:27:25.002 --> 02:27:26.003
NOT HESITATE TO FOLLOW UP WITH

02:27:26.070 --> 02:27:27.405
ME. IF ANY OF THE COMMENTS I

02:27:27.471 --> 02:27:28.339
MADE PEAK YOUR INTEREST BECAUSE

MUCH. A FELL. I'M SURE EACH OF.

02:27:37.882 --> 02:27:38.649
TOUCHED UPON WHAT YOU NORMALLY

02:27:38.716 --> 02:27:40.084
CALL A COVER AN ENTIRE

02:27:40.151 --> 02:27:41.986
SEMESTER'S OUR TEXTBOOKS. ABOUT

02:27:42.053 --> 02:27:43.955
WE APPRECIATE THE- THE

02:27:44.021 --> 02:27:46.290
HIGHLIGHTS ANY. QUESTIONS FROM

OR YOUR GROUP PLANNING ANY-

02:27:55.066 --> 02:27:56.033
BASED ON YOUR RESEARCH ANY

02:27:56.100 --> 02:27:58.269
REPORTS ON A POLICY

02:27:58.336 --> 02:27:59.971
RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND

02:28:00.037 --> 02:28:02.373
ELECTRICITY PRICING CALIFORNIA.

02:28:02.440 --> 02:28:05.243
YEAH SO WE- WROTE A QUICK

02:28:05.309 --> 02:28:07.678
SURVEY- ONE REPORTER

02:28:07.745 --> 02:28:09.680
PRELIMINARY REPORT THAT WAS

02:28:09.747 --> 02:28:11.249
PARTLY SUPPORTED BY NEXT TEN

02:28:11.315 --> 02:28:13.084
WHICH WE RELEASED A LAST SPRING

02:28:13.150 --> 02:28:14.285
IN ORDER TO TRAIN INFORM THE

02:28:14.352 --> 02:28:15.386
POLICY DISCUSSION AS IT

02:28:15.453 --> 02:28:17.121
UNFOLDED BUT THIS WORK IS I'M

02:28:17.188 --> 02:28:17.622
GOING SO THEY'LL BE A

02:28:17.688 --> 02:28:20.791
SUBSEQUENT REPORT COMING OUT IN

02:28:20.858 --> 02:28:21.392
THE FALL AND PROBABLY MORE TO

02:28:21.459 --> 02:28:23.194
FOLLOW. BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO

02:28:23.261 --> 02:28:24.862
SHARE THE REPORT WITH YOU- THAT

02:28:24.929 --> 02:28:28.065
WE HAVE. THAT'S ALREADY OUT- IN

02:28:28.132 --> 02:28:29.634
FUTURE REPORTS AS THEY BECOME

02:28:29.700 --> 02:28:32.003
AVAILABLE. THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

02:28:32.069 --> 02:28:33.437
SEND IT TO THE FOLKS THAT

02:28:33.504 --> 02:28:34.872
CONTACTED YOU TO ARRANGE FOR

02:28:34.939 --> 02:28:36.574
YEP BECAME HAPPY TO DO THAT AND

02:28:36.641 --> 02:28:38.309
HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP IF YOU HAVE

02:28:38.376 --> 02:28:44.882
ANY QUESTIONS WE CAN.

02:28:44.949 --> 02:28:47.351
DEFINITELY YOU YOU TALKED ABOUT

02:28:47.418 --> 02:28:50.021
HOW YOU KNOW WE NEED TO KEEP A-

02:28:50.087 --> 02:28:52.123
VIA THE PROPER PERSPECTIVE ON

02:28:52.189 --> 02:28:54.792
ON CALIFORNIA'S. ROLE WHICH IS

02:28:54.859 --> 02:28:56.327
TRYING TO MAXIMIZE THE GLOBAL

02:28:56.394 --> 02:28:59.897
IMPACT ON ON ON CLIMATE CHANGE-

02:28:59.964 --> 02:29:03.834
GIVEN OUR- YOU KNOW A FRACTION

02:29:03.901 --> 02:29:06.103
OF OUR GLOBAL CONTRIBUTION TO

02:29:06.170 --> 02:29:09.840
THE GREENHOUSE GAS GASES IT AND

02:29:09.907 --> 02:29:12.043
I AND OUR LARGER POTENTIAL TO

02:29:12.109 --> 02:29:13.711
BE ABLE TO INNOVATE AND EXPORT

02:29:13.778 --> 02:29:20.484
EXPORT. TO- IN A GAME CHANGING-

02:29:20.551 --> 02:29:24.055
TECHNOLOGY- DO YOU HAVE ANY ANY

02:29:24.121 --> 02:29:25.723
TOPLINE RECOMMENDATIONS IN

02:29:25.790 --> 02:29:28.659
TERMS OF HOW. THE LEGISLATURE

02:29:28.726 --> 02:29:31.729
CAN BEST INCENTIVIZE THOSE TYPE

02:29:31.796 --> 02:29:37.034
OF- INNOVATIONS. YEAH I MEAN

02:29:37.101 --> 02:29:38.836
GENERALLY SPEAKING- I'VE BEEN

02:29:38.903 --> 02:29:39.904
TRYING TO THINK ABOUT SOMETHING

02:29:39.970 --> 02:29:41.005
MORE CONCRETE I CAN OPERATE

02:29:41.072 --> 02:29:42.239
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A REALLY

02:29:42.306 --> 02:29:45.509
GOOD QUESTION- I DO HAVE SOME

02:29:45.576 --> 02:29:47.511
CONCERNS ABOUT PUSHING TOO

02:29:47.578 --> 02:29:49.246
QUICKLY TOWARDS GOALS THAT WE

02:29:49.313 --> 02:29:51.182
NEED TO REACH AT SOME POINT MY

02:29:51.248 --> 02:29:52.616
UNDERSTANDING OF THE COST OF

02:29:52.683 --> 02:29:55.553
THAT LAST 23% REDUCTIONS ARE

02:29:55.619 --> 02:29:56.387
GOING TO BE QUITE HIGH GIVEN

02:29:56.454 --> 02:29:57.788
THE TECHNOLOGIES WE ALREADY

02:29:57.855 --> 02:30:00.091
HAVE IN HAND TODAY BUT THAT

02:30:00.157 --> 02:30:01.592
THOSE COSTS COULD FALL AS

02:30:01.659 --> 02:30:03.327
TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION PROCEED

02:30:03.394 --> 02:30:05.696
TO PAY SO- I GUESS STRIKING A

02:30:05.763 --> 02:30:09.033
BALANCE BETWEEN DOING IT BY

02:30:09.100 --> 02:30:09.633
TWENTY THIRTY FIVE AT GRAPHIC

02:30:09.700 --> 02:30:11.602
OFTEN POTENTIALLY. IMPACTED

02:30:11.669 --> 02:30:12.937
PARTICULARLY TO LOWER INCOME

02:30:13.003 --> 02:30:16.607
CALIFORNIANS OF VERSES US ARE

02:30:16.674 --> 02:30:17.608
MORE MEASURED APPROACH OF

02:30:17.675 --> 02:30:18.409
THINKS ABOUT ALL THE

02:30:18.476 --> 02:30:19.777
INNOVATIONS IN THE CHILLING

02:30:19.844 --> 02:30:21.212
WE'RE GONNA NEED TO MAKE FROM

02:30:21.278 --> 02:30:22.079
THE INFRASTRUCTURE FROM THE

02:30:22.146 --> 02:30:23.881
TECHNOLOGY TO THE INSTITUTIONS

02:30:23.948 --> 02:30:25.649
AND REGULATIONS SO WE CAN

02:30:25.716 --> 02:30:27.752
DEMONSTRATE A SYSTEMIC OUT SET

02:30:27.818 --> 02:30:30.521
OF POLICY INTERVENTIONS AND AN

02:30:30.588 --> 02:30:31.756
INCENTIVE THAT WE NEED TO GET

02:30:31.822 --> 02:30:32.790
THERE SO I THINK IT'S JUST

02:30:32.857 --> 02:30:34.658
THINKING ABOUT WHY WE'RE DOING

02:30:34.725 --> 02:30:37.595
IT AND WHETHER- PUSHING HARD AT

02:30:37.661 --> 02:30:39.697
GREAT COST TO HIT A TARGET I'M

02:30:39.764 --> 02:30:41.232
IN CALIFORNIA WHAT THAT

02:30:41.298 --> 02:30:42.733
DEMONSTRATES THE WORLD CLASS

02:30:42.800 --> 02:30:44.368
VERSUS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE

02:30:44.435 --> 02:30:45.536
VARIOUS CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE

02:30:45.603 --> 02:30:46.704
GONNA NEED TO MAKE TO MAKE SURE

02:30:46.771 --> 02:30:47.338
THE EFFORT OF THAT THE

02:30:47.405 --> 02:30:51.409
TRANSITION. IS EQUITABLE AND

02:30:51.475 --> 02:30:51.976
SUSTAINABLE AND AFFORDABLE.

02:30:52.042 --> 02:30:54.311
ASSEMBLY ONE BURKE YEAH ON THE

02:30:54.378 --> 02:30:56.247
CHAIRS QUESTION ABOUT OUR ROLE

02:30:56.313 --> 02:30:58.416
AS A LEADER AND- I APPRECIATE

02:30:58.482 --> 02:30:59.550
THE LAST THING YOU JUST SAID

02:30:59.617 --> 02:31:01.218
BECAUSEYOU DID MENTION THAT.

02:31:01.285 --> 02:31:02.319
YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE THINGS

02:31:02.386 --> 02:31:03.788
ARE AGGRESSIVE A LOT OF.

02:31:03.854 --> 02:31:05.456
OPPORTUNITIES WE'RE TAKING OUR

02:31:05.523 --> 02:31:07.258
OUR REGRESSIVE AND- I AM

02:31:07.324 --> 02:31:09.026
CURIOUS WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE

02:31:09.093 --> 02:31:11.362
ON WHAT OUR RESPONSIBILITY. IS

02:31:11.429 --> 02:31:12.663
AS A LEADER TO SHOW THAT ALL

02:31:12.730 --> 02:31:15.132
COMMUNITIES COME ALONG ON THIS

02:31:15.199 --> 02:31:17.668
JOURNEY- TWO OF OUR NINE

02:31:17.735 --> 02:31:20.838
PANELISTS ARE. PEOPLE OF COLOR.

02:31:20.905 --> 02:31:23.574
AND SO I AM CURIOUS WHAT WHAT

02:31:23.641 --> 02:31:24.809
YOU THINK OUR ROLE AS LEADERS

02:31:24.875 --> 02:31:27.411
IS. IS IN NOT ANY OF OUR IN THE

02:31:27.478 --> 02:31:31.482
SPACE- NOT OBVIOUSLY JUST TO

02:31:31.549 --> 02:31:33.250
EACH OTHER BUT TO THE WORLD. I

02:31:33.317 --> 02:31:33.751
REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR

02:31:33.818 --> 02:31:36.654
QUESTION- SO I GUESS ONE THING

02:31:36.720 --> 02:31:37.488
THAT I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO

02:31:37.555 --> 02:31:40.324
GET INTO DO AS I THINK I WANNA-

02:31:40.391 --> 02:31:42.593
MAKE CLEAR THAT. THE WHAT I SEE

02:31:42.660 --> 02:31:43.594
IS THE PROMISE SPECIALLY IN THE

02:31:43.661 --> 02:31:44.728
ELECTRICITY IN THE CASE OF

02:31:44.795 --> 02:31:46.764
ELECTRICITY IS NOT NOT

02:31:46.831 --> 02:31:48.299
NECESSARILY INVESTMENTS WERE

02:31:48.365 --> 02:31:49.633
MAKING BUT HOW WE'RE PAYING FOR

02:31:49.700 --> 02:31:51.602
THEM. SO FOR EXAMPLE IN OUR

02:31:51.669 --> 02:31:53.504
REPORT WE TALK ABOUT HOW AND

02:31:53.571 --> 02:31:55.072
INCREASED INCOME TAX WOULD BE

02:31:55.139 --> 02:31:56.807
FAR LESS REGRESSIVE YOU WOULD

02:31:56.874 --> 02:31:58.342
WRITE RECOVER THE REVENUES WE

02:31:58.409 --> 02:32:00.177
NEED TO COVER THESE COSTS BUT

02:32:00.244 --> 02:32:01.846
IN A FAR LESS AGGRESSIVE WAY.

02:32:01.912 --> 02:32:03.214
AND IN A MORE EFFICIENT WAY TO

02:32:03.280 --> 02:32:04.181
THE EXTENT THAT ALLOWS US TO

02:32:04.248 --> 02:32:05.416
REDUCE ELECTRICITY PRICES

02:32:05.483 --> 02:32:07.151
CLOSER TO WHERE EFFICIENT PRICE

02:32:07.218 --> 02:32:09.119
WOULD BE. I SEE AND WE HAVE

02:32:09.186 --> 02:32:10.187
BEEN ARGUING AS PART OF THE

02:32:10.254 --> 02:32:11.856
PROJECT I MENTIONED THAT WE DO

02:32:11.922 --> 02:32:13.591
HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO

02:32:13.657 --> 02:32:14.859
DEMONSTRATE LEADERSHIP NOT ONLY

02:32:14.925 --> 02:32:17.027
IN TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION AND

02:32:17.094 --> 02:32:18.662
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. BUT

02:32:18.729 --> 02:32:20.764
ALSO IN DEMONSTRATING HOW YOU

02:32:20.831 --> 02:32:22.867
DEPLOY THESE TECHNOLOGIES AND

02:32:22.933 --> 02:32:23.968
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THIS

02:32:24.034 --> 02:32:25.569
TRANSITION IN AN EQUITABLE AND

02:32:25.636 --> 02:32:27.838
AFFORDABLE WAY SO I DO SEE. AND

02:32:27.905 --> 02:32:29.373
I'D BE HAPPY TO TALK FURTHER WE

02:32:29.440 --> 02:32:31.342
TALKED ABOUT INCOME BASED FIXED

02:32:31.408 --> 02:32:32.476
CHARGES THERE ARE NUMBER OF

02:32:32.543 --> 02:32:33.978
DEGREES OF FREEDOM WE HAVE AND

02:32:34.044 --> 02:32:34.745
WE'RE TRYING TO RAISE THE

02:32:34.812 --> 02:32:35.913
REVENUES TO COVER THESE

02:32:35.980 --> 02:32:38.015
INVESTMENTS IN COSTS. THAT

02:32:38.082 --> 02:32:39.149
STRIKES A BETTER BALANCE

02:32:39.216 --> 02:32:41.051
BETWEEN CLIMATE CHANGE ACTION

02:32:41.118 --> 02:32:43.487
WE NEED TO MAKE. ANY EQUITY.

02:32:43.554 --> 02:32:44.788
EQUITY AND AFFORDABILITY

02:32:44.855 --> 02:32:48.859
CONCERNS. THAT SHOULD BE TOP OF

02:32:48.926 --> 02:32:49.326
MIND IN MY OPINION. I

02:32:49.393 --> 02:32:51.729
APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. ANY

02:32:51.795 --> 02:32:52.229
OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE

02:32:52.296 --> 02:32:55.900
COMMITTEE. THANK YOU JUST REAL

02:32:55.966 --> 02:32:56.534
QUICK I THINK YOU YOU SAID THIS

02:32:56.600 --> 02:32:58.102
BUT DO YOU BELIEVE. A CURRENT

02:32:58.168 --> 02:32:59.570
CAPTURE MARKET PRICES ARE

02:32:59.637 --> 02:33:01.839
PLANNING A STRONG ENOUGH. PRICE

02:33:01.906 --> 02:33:02.573
SIGNAL RELATIVE TO THE PACE OF

02:33:02.640 --> 02:33:05.242
CHANGE WE NEED. NOW YEAH. I

02:33:05.309 --> 02:33:06.143
THINK THEY NEED TO BE HIGHER

02:33:06.210 --> 02:33:08.445
AND I THINK ONE THING TO. TO AT

02:33:08.512 --> 02:33:09.580
RUNS AND BROWN AND HIS

02:33:09.647 --> 02:33:10.648
COLLEAGUES HAVE DONE EXCELLENT

02:33:10.714 --> 02:33:12.249
WORK AND IF HE ARTICULATED IT

02:33:12.316 --> 02:33:13.317
CAN BE HARD TO UNDERSTAND THE

02:33:13.384 --> 02:33:15.386
MARGINAL. IMPLICIT COSTS WERE

02:33:15.452 --> 02:33:17.354
PAYING FOR OTHER MEASURES BUT I

02:33:17.421 --> 02:33:17.988
THINK THE BULK OF THE EVIDENCE

02:33:18.055 --> 02:33:19.657
SUGGESTS THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT

02:33:19.723 --> 02:33:21.225
WE'RE PAYING PER TON OF CARBON

02:33:21.292 --> 02:33:22.893
REDUCE BY SOME OF OUR MANDATES

02:33:22.960 --> 02:33:24.128
MORE PRESCRIPTIVE REGULATIONS

02:33:24.194 --> 02:33:25.329
AS WELL ABOVE THE PRICE WE'RE

02:33:25.396 --> 02:33:27.031
SEEING. IN THE MARKET WHICH

02:33:27.097 --> 02:33:28.732
SUGGESTS THAT THERE COULD BE.

02:33:28.799 --> 02:33:29.967
RELATIVELY COST EFFECTIVE

02:33:30.034 --> 02:33:32.036
CARBON REDUCTION OPTIONS AND

02:33:32.102 --> 02:33:32.970
MEASURES THAT WE'RE NOT

02:33:33.037 --> 02:33:34.138
DEPLOYING THAT COULD BE

02:33:34.204 --> 02:33:36.840

PUBLIC INVESTMENTS IN RENEWABLE

EXPANDED AS WE FURTHER DEPLOY

02:42:41.685 --> 02:42:43.887
EVEY VEHICLES. SOME OF THE

02:42:43.954 --> 02:42:45.388
THINGS THAT WE WANT THE

02:42:45.455 --> 02:42:46.590
LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER MOVING

02:42:46.656 --> 02:42:48.558
FORWARD. WE BELIEVE THAT

02:42:48.625 --> 02:42:50.160
SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC INVESTMENT

02:42:50.227 --> 02:42:51.661

FIRST CARBON REDUCTION AND

02:42:53.597 --> 02:42:55.832
RENEWABLE PORTFOLIOS. CARBON

SOLAR ALL OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES

02:43:03.440 --> 02:43:05.609
ARE VIABLE THEY ALL DESERVE

02:43:05.675 --> 02:43:07.110
ATTENTION THEY SHOULD BE

MODELED AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH

02:43:08.778 --> 02:43:10.547
THE SCOPING PLAN. AND THEY

02:43:10.614 --> 02:43:12.349
THEY'RE DEFINITELY SIGNIFICANT

02:43:12.415 --> 02:43:14.317
ENOUGH THAT PUBLIC INVESTMENT

02:43:14.384 --> 02:43:16.253
SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. WE ALSO

02:43:16.319 --> 02:43:18.321
BELIEVE STRICT LABOR STANDARDS

WE DON'T THINK THINGS SHOULD

02:43:57.060 --> 02:43:58.695
GET TO THIS POINT. WE BELIEVE

02:43:58.762 --> 02:43:59.563
LABOUR'S VOICE SHOULD BE

02:43:59.629 --> 02:44:01.665

STRATEGIES LIKE CARBON CAPTURE

02:45:13.770 --> 02:45:14.971
BECAUSE SOME WOULD RATHER SEE

02:57:04.280 --> 02:57:06.382
IMPORTANT. ESPECIALLY AS THE

LEGISLATURE IS CONSIDERING NEW.

02:57:08.351 --> 02:57:09.285

02:57:32.274 --> 02:57:34.343
IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE KNOW

WHICH TOOLS AND PATHWAYS WILL

02:57:35.978 --> 02:57:38.647
BE AVAILABLE TO TREAT THE NEW

02:57:38.714 --> 02:57:39.982
GOALS THAT REACH BEYOND TWENTY

02:57:40.049 --> 02:57:41.584
THIRTY. WITHOUT THIS

MEAN. TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS INTO

02:57:50.226 --> 02:57:52.228
THE STATE'S ECONOMY. THE PATH

BOTH THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM

02:57:53.963 --> 02:57:54.797
AND THE LOW CARBON FUEL

02:57:54.864 --> 02:57:56.098
STANDARD PROGRAM HAVE DRIVEN

02:57:56.165 --> 02:57:57.533
TREMENDOUS INNOVATION AND

02:57:57.600 --> 02:57:59.268
CERTAINLY IN OUR INDUSTRY AND

02:57:59.335 --> 02:58:01.203
OTHERS. AND WE MUST CONSIDER

02:58:01.270 --> 02:58:03.672
HOW THESE POLICIES CONTINUE TO

02:58:03.739 --> 02:58:05.041
EFFECTUATE THE PORTENT

INNOVATIONS GOING FORWARD

02:58:07.843 --> 02:58:10.413
FORWARD. AND I BELIEVE RATHER

02:58:10.479 --> 02:58:12.948
THAN SETTING A NEW GOAL TWENTY

02:58:13.015 --> 02:58:14.917
FOUR YEARS OUT. AS PROPOSED IN

02:58:14.984 --> 02:58:16.619
AB THIRTEEN NINETY FIVE THAT

02:58:16.685 --> 02:58:18.020
THIS LEGISLATURE CAN MAKE MUCH

02:58:18.087 --> 02:58:19.722
MORE SIGNIFICANT CLIMATE

02:58:19.789 --> 02:58:21.657
PROGRESS THIS YEAR. BY

02:58:21.724 --> 02:58:23.793
DEMONSTRATING THE POLITICAL

02:58:23.859 --> 02:58:27.163
WILL NECESSARY TO DEPLOY CARBON

02:58:27.229 --> 02:58:28.764
CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION IN

02:58:28.831 --> 02:58:31.000
CALIFORNIA AND ENSURING THAT

02:58:31.067 --> 02:58:32.468
THE STATE IS ON TRACK TO MEET

02:58:32.535 --> 02:58:34.870
OUR CLIMATE GOALS. AND I HAVE

02:58:34.937 --> 02:58:36.972
BEEN IN THAT CONVERSATION FOR

02:58:37.039 --> 02:58:38.040
QUITE SOME TIME WHEN I WAS

02:58:38.107 --> 02:58:39.975
APPOINTED. BY THE LEGISLATURE

02:58:40.042 --> 02:58:41.177
IN THE ENERGY COMMISSION TO SIT

02:58:41.243 --> 02:58:43.345
ON A PANEL WHEN WE MAPPED OUT

02:58:43.412 --> 02:58:46.248
C. C. U. S. QUITE SOMETIME AGO

02:58:46.315 --> 02:58:46.916
FOR HOW TO REACH THAT IN

02:58:46.982 --> 02:58:49.285
CALIFORNIA. AN EXPERT INCLUDING

02:58:49.351 --> 02:58:52.388
THE IPCC AND FRANKLY. THE

02:58:52.455 --> 02:58:53.322
ENTIRE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY

02:58:53.389 --> 02:58:56.625
AGREED THAT CCS TECHNOLOGY WILL

02:58:56.692 --> 02:58:59.361
BE KEY IN ADVANCING OUR CLIMATE

02:58:59.428 --> 02:59:00.896
GOALS. AND SENATOR SKINNER

APPRECIATE YOU KNOW THE

02:59:02.231 --> 02:59:04.200
OPPORTUNITIES HERE AND I KNOW

02:59:04.266 --> 02:59:05.101
THAT THEY ARE BROUGHT

02:59:05.167 --> 02:59:08.237
OPPORTUNITIES AND WE- ARE

02:59:08.304 --> 02:59:10.439
INTERESTED IN ALL OF THEM- IT

02:59:10.506 --> 02:59:11.774
CERTAINLY EVEN ONCE ON THE

02:59:11.841 --> 02:59:13.709
NATURAL WORKING LANDS. SO WHY

02:59:13.776 --> 02:59:15.411
OTHER STATES AND COUNTRIES ARE

02:59:15.478 --> 02:59:16.712
PERMITTING AND BUILDING THESE

02:59:16.779 --> 02:59:18.747
PROJECTS AND THERE ARE MANY

02:59:18.814 --> 02:59:20.249
WHICH I COULD ARTICULATED BUT

02:59:20.316 --> 02:59:22.852
THAT PART TIME. CALIFORNIA IS

02:59:22.918 --> 02:59:24.653
IN MY OPINION FALLING WOEFULLY

02:59:24.720 --> 02:59:27.123
BEHIND DESPITE HAVING SOME OF

02:59:27.189 --> 02:59:28.791
FRANKLY THE BEST SKILLED AND

INDUSTRIAL SECTOR AND SOME OF

02:59:37.233 --> 02:59:39.635
FRANKLY THE BEST GEOLOGY IN THE

02:59:39.702 --> 02:59:42.004
WORLD TO STORE CARBON. SO NOW

02:59:42.071 --> 02:59:43.772
IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO FRANKLY

02:59:43.839 --> 02:59:45.808
MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME ENSURE

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION GOAL.

03:01:06.088 --> 03:01:07.523
AND I'M ALSO GOING TO BRIEFLY

03:01:07.590 --> 03:01:08.557

THIRTY TO CONTINUE CALIFORNIA'S

03:01:15.464 --> 03:01:16.966
CLIMATE LEGACY OF CLIMATE

03:01:17.032 --> 03:01:19.602
LEADERSHIP AND CODIFIED- TWENTY

03:01:19.668 --> 03:01:21.170
THIRTY GOAL. IN MEETING THIS

03:01:21.237 --> 03:01:23.906
GOAL IS ESSENTIAL FOR LIMITING

03:01:23.973 --> 03:01:24.440
CALIFORNIA'S IMPACT ON THE

03:01:24.506 --> 03:01:26.875
CLIMATE. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT

03:01:26.942 --> 03:01:28.444
CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAS THE

03:01:28.510 --> 03:01:29.845
SWEET OF POLICIES IT NEEDS TO

03:01:29.912 --> 03:01:31.947
MEET THIS GOAL INCLUDING THE

03:01:32.014 --> 03:01:34.283
ECONOMY WIDE DECLINING LIMIT ON

03:01:34.350 --> 03:01:36.952
GREENHOUSE GASES. WHEN WELL

03:01:37.019 --> 03:01:38.854
DESIGNED TO THIS LIMIT OR CAP

03:01:38.921 --> 03:01:40.456
PROVIDES THE GREATEST POSSIBLE

03:01:40.522 --> 03:01:42.024
CERTAINTY OF MEETING THE WRIT

03:01:42.091 --> 03:01:43.826
BEATING REDUCTION GOALS AND IT

03:01:43.892 --> 03:01:45.527
IS V. ESSENTIAL FEATURE OF THE

03:01:45.594 --> 03:01:47.463
CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. IT'S

03:01:47.529 --> 03:01:48.964
SECTOR SPECIFIC POLICIES

03:01:49.031 --> 03:01:50.733
ACHIEVE GREATER REDUCTIONS THAN

03:01:50.799 --> 03:01:52.534
EXPECTED THEN THERE IS LESS

03:01:52.601 --> 03:01:53.902
PRESSURE ON THE CAP AND THAT'S

03:01:53.969 --> 03:01:55.871
FINE. BUT IF OTHER PROGRAMS

03:01:55.938 --> 03:01:58.107
DELIVER FEWER REDUCTIONS IN THE

03:01:58.173 --> 03:02:00.242
CAP HAS TO REMAIN THE BACKSTOPS

03:02:00.309 --> 03:02:01.944
TO ENSURE EMISSIONS CONTINUE TO

03:02:02.011 --> 03:02:04.880
DECLINE AT THE PEACE REQUIRED

03:02:04.947 --> 03:02:06.982
TO MEET OUR GOALS. HOWEVER IN

03:02:07.049 --> 03:02:08.417
ORDER TO CONTINUE PLAYING THE

03:02:08.484 --> 03:02:10.953
ROLE OF BACKSTOPS EMISSIONS CAP

03:02:11.020 --> 03:02:13.022
HAS TO BE CALIBRATED TO

03:02:13.088 --> 03:02:14.290
ACTUALLY MEET THE TWENTY THIRTY

03:02:14.356 --> 03:02:16.492
PEOPLE. IN CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO

03:02:16.558 --> 03:02:17.626
INCREASE THE AMBITION OF THE

03:02:17.693 --> 03:02:19.295
CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM THAT IS

03:02:19.361 --> 03:02:21.497
TIGHTEN THE CAP. TO ENSURE

03:02:21.563 --> 03:02:23.465
REQUIRED REDUCTIONS BY TWENTY

03:02:23.532 --> 03:02:25.834
THIRTY. A TIGHTER CAP MEANS THE

03:02:25.901 --> 03:02:27.503
EMISSIONS BUDGET IS SMALLER

03:02:27.569 --> 03:02:30.739
FEWER ALLOWANCES ARE ISSUED AND

03:02:30.806 --> 03:02:32.374
THE LEVEL OF EMISSIONS IS LOWER.

03:02:32.441 --> 03:02:33.609
AND WE HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY

03:02:33.676 --> 03:02:35.577
BECAUSE THIS STATE CELEBRATED

03:02:35.644 --> 03:02:38.080
AND JUSTIFIABLY SO A GREAT

03:02:38.147 --> 03:02:39.982
ACHIEVEMENT WHEN IT MET ITS

03:02:40.049 --> 03:02:40.649
TWENTY TWENTY GREENHOUSE GAS

03:02:40.716 --> 03:02:44.086
REDUCTION GOAL OF RETURNING TO

03:02:44.153 --> 03:02:44.653
NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS FOUR

03:02:44.720 --> 03:02:46.355
YEARS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. AND

03:02:46.422 --> 03:02:47.890
THAT'S SUCCESS MEANS THAT WE

03:02:47.956 --> 03:02:49.258
HAVE THE CHANCE TO INCREASE THE

03:02:49.325 --> 03:02:51.126
STRINGENCY OF THE CAP BY

03:02:51.193 --> 03:02:52.628
SETTING IT BASED ON ACTUAL

03:02:52.695 --> 03:02:54.630
EMISSIONS WHICH ARE BELOW THE

03:02:54.697 --> 03:02:56.465
TWENTY TWENTY TARGET. A LOWER

03:02:56.532 --> 03:02:58.934
EMISSIONS CAP ESSENTIALLY MAKES

03:02:59.001 --> 03:03:00.703
THOSE REDUCTIONS PERMANENT.

03:03:00.769 --> 03:03:02.638
ADDITIONALLY THE LEGISLATIVE

03:03:02.705 --> 03:03:04.340
ANALYST'S OFFICE ESTIMATED THAT

03:03:04.406 --> 03:03:05.708
THERE ARE BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED

03:03:05.774 --> 03:03:06.742
AND THREE HUNDRED MILLION

03:03:06.809 --> 03:03:08.210
BANKED ALLOWANCES IN THE CAP

03:03:08.277 --> 03:03:09.945
AND TRADE PROGRAM. THAT IS

03:03:10.012 --> 03:03:11.747
ALLOWANCES THAT HAVE BEEN SAVED

03:03:11.814 --> 03:03:14.049
FOR FUTURE COMPLIANCE USE. NOT

03:03:14.116 --> 03:03:15.718
WILL BANKING IS NOT INHERENTLY

03:03:15.784 --> 03:03:17.820
PROBLEMATIC THE BANK HAS TO BE

03:03:17.886 --> 03:03:19.455
ACCOUNTED FOR IN SETTING THE

03:03:19.521 --> 03:03:21.757
ADMISSIONS CAP. SO TAKEN

03:03:21.824 --> 03:03:23.592
TOGETHER THERE IS A NEED TO RE

03:03:23.659 --> 03:03:25.327
CALIBRATE THE EMISSIONS CAP TO

03:03:25.394 --> 03:03:27.563
ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA IS ON

03:03:27.629 --> 03:03:29.198
TRACK TO MEET ITS TWENTY THIRTY

03:03:29.264 --> 03:03:31.100
GOAL. IS NOT THE ONLY THING THE

03:03:31.166 --> 03:03:32.601
STATE NEEDS TO DO BUT IT ISN'T

03:03:32.668 --> 03:03:34.703
NECESSARY. THE STATE HAS TO

03:03:34.770 --> 03:03:36.138
AGGRESSIVELY INCREASE THE

03:03:36.205 --> 03:03:37.172
AMBITION OF ITS POLICY

03:03:37.239 --> 03:03:39.274
ESPECIALLY CAP AND TRADE AND IT

03:03:39.341 --> 03:03:41.377
MUST HAPPEN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE

03:03:41.443 --> 03:03:43.846
TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS STILL

03:03:43.912 --> 03:03:45.013
TIME TO GET ON TRACK TO TWENTY

03:03:45.080 --> 03:03:46.982
THIRTY. AT THE SAME TIME

03:03:47.049 --> 03:03:48.650
CALIFORNIA SHOULD ALSO SEEK

03:03:48.717 --> 03:03:50.085
ADDITIONAL MEASURES TO ENSURE

03:03:50.152 --> 03:03:51.120
THE STATE IS ACHIEVING

03:03:51.186 --> 03:03:52.654
REDUCTIONS IN LOCAL AIR

03:03:56.859 --> 03:03:58.360
CALIFORNIA HAS MADE GREAT

03:03:58.427 --> 03:03:59.628
PROGRESS IN IMPROVING AIR

03:03:59.695 --> 03:04:01.029

EXPLAINED EARLIER TODAY. MUCH

03:04:03.065 --> 03:04:04.566
OF THE STATE STILL SUFFERS FROM

03:04:04.633 --> 03:04:06.402
DANGEROUS AIR POLLUTION AND

03:04:06.468 --> 03:04:07.703
THIS PROBLEM IS ESPECIALLY

03:04:07.770 --> 03:04:10.038
ACUTE IN COMMUNITIES WITH LOWER

AIR QUALITY PROVISIONS THAT

03:04:19.248 --> 03:04:20.949
CALIFORNIA COULD CONSIDER

03:04:21.016 --> 03:04:23.619
INCLUDING. PERCENT DISABILITY

NET ZERO EMISSIONS BY. BY

03:08:40.275 --> 03:08:40.776

03:08:42.778 --> 03:08:44.012
YOU SENATOR AND YOU KNOW I'M

I'M A COMBINATION OF A PRACTICE

03:08:46.081 --> 03:08:49.217
MEDICINE AND OPTIMISTIC- I DO

03:08:49.284 --> 03:08:51.520
BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE IN THE

03:08:51.586 --> 03:08:52.988
SCOPING PLAN AND I THINK THE

03:08:53.055 --> 03:08:54.589
FOCUS- THIS HEARING ON THE

03:08:54.656 --> 03:08:55.857
SCOPING PLAN IS REALLY

03:08:55.924 --> 03:08:57.526
IMPORTANT. BECAUSE ALL OF THOSE

03:08:57.592 --> 03:08:59.594
SCENARIOS THAT EVERYONE REFERS

03:08:59.661 --> 03:09:01.830
TO. THAT WE WILL BE LOOKING AT

03:09:01.897 --> 03:09:03.899
ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AS

03:09:03.965 --> 03:09:06.802
YOU'RE BALANCING. BE GOALS WITH

03:09:06.868 --> 03:09:08.770
THE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY AND I

03:09:08.837 --> 03:09:11.373
SAY THAT. BECAUSE AS WE ALL

03:09:11.440 --> 03:09:13.408
KNOW AND I DON'T SAY THIS THAT

03:09:13.475 --> 03:09:14.776
CALIFORNIA SHOULD NOT BE A

03:09:14.843 --> 03:09:16.178
LEADER IN THE SPACE OF COURSE

03:09:16.244 --> 03:09:18.647
WE SHORT. BUT CALIFORNIA'S LESS

03:09:18.714 --> 03:09:21.049
THAN 1% OF THE GLOBAL EMISSIONS

03:09:21.116 --> 03:09:23.485
IN THIS WORLD AND SO WE DO HAVE

03:09:23.552 --> 03:09:24.820
TO DEMONSTRATE LEADERSHIP

03:09:24.886 --> 03:09:26.655
THROUGH PROGRAMS THAT WORK AND

03:09:26.722 --> 03:09:28.056
THAT BALANCE THE ECONOMY AND

03:09:28.123 --> 03:09:29.458
THE ENVIRONMENT AND OUR SOCIAL

03:09:29.524 --> 03:09:30.859
JUSTICE NEEDS ARE OF OUR MIDDLE

03:09:30.926 --> 03:09:32.127
JUSTICE NEEDS. THAT'S GOING TO

03:09:32.194 --> 03:09:34.396
BE IMPERATIVE. BUT THE ECONOMIC

03:09:34.463 --> 03:09:35.630
SIDE OF THIS IS EQUALLY

03:09:35.697 --> 03:09:37.733
IMPORTANT BECAUSE AS WE LOOK AT

03:09:37.799 --> 03:09:39.768
THESE SCENARIOS AND WE LOOK AT

03:09:39.835 --> 03:09:41.136
THE TARGET DATES AND WE LOOK AT

03:09:41.203 --> 03:09:43.271
THE SCOPING PLAN. THEY'RE GOING

03:09:43.338 --> 03:09:45.373
TO BE ONES THAT CAN THAT IS

03:09:45.440 --> 03:09:47.008
THAT HAVE OF MUCH HIGHER COSTS

03:09:47.075 --> 03:09:48.210
THAN OTHERS AND YOU CAN STILL

03:09:48.276 --> 03:09:50.378
ACHIEVE THE GOALS. IN THE MOST

03:09:50.445 --> 03:09:52.581
COST EFFECTIVE WAY SO IT'S A

03:09:52.647 --> 03:09:54.649
LONG WAY TO SAY THAT I THINK

03:09:54.716 --> 03:09:56.918
WHAT CARP HAS OUTLINED GIVES US

03:09:56.985 --> 03:09:59.054
MULTIPLE OPPORTUNITY. TO

03:09:59.121 --> 03:10:01.089
EXPLORE THE RIGHT COMBINATION

03:10:01.156 --> 03:10:02.724
OF WHAT'S GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE

03:10:02.791 --> 03:10:04.392
TO MEET THESE GOALS BECAUSE

03:10:04.459 --> 03:10:05.961
THEY ARE AGGRESSIVE THEY DO

03:10:06.027 --> 03:10:08.163
SHOW LEADERSHIP. BUT WE CAN'T

03:10:08.230 --> 03:10:09.898
BRING SO MUCH ECONOMIC CARD ON

03:10:09.965 --> 03:10:11.500
THE CONSTITUENTS AND CITIZENS

03:10:11.566 --> 03:10:13.835
OF THE STATE. THAT WE CAN'T

03:10:13.902 --> 03:10:15.070
HAVE A PROGRAM THAT WILL

03:10:15.137 --> 03:10:18.039
SURVIVE AND SO I AM OPTIMISTIC

03:10:18.106 --> 03:10:20.475
ARC OUR MEMBERS ARE ALL OVER

03:10:20.542 --> 03:10:22.310
INNOVATION IT'S AN EXCITING

03:10:22.377 --> 03:10:24.679
TIME- I DIDN'T MENTION ALL OF

03:10:24.746 --> 03:10:26.414
THE CCS ACTIVITY WE HAVE IN THE

03:10:26.481 --> 03:10:27.916
STATE THAT'S EITHER ON THE

03:10:27.983 --> 03:10:29.518
BOOKS ARE BEING DISCUSSED. I

03:10:29.584 --> 03:10:31.153
THINK IT'S VERY EXCITING

03:10:31.219 --> 03:10:33.922
OPPORTUNITIES AND MANY OF THOSE

03:10:33.989 --> 03:10:35.957
ARE ARE NOT IN THE FOSSIL FUEL

03:10:36.024 --> 03:10:38.527
SECTOR THEY ARE AND THEY ARE IN

03:10:38.593 --> 03:10:42.731
OTHER SECTORS AS WELL SO. WHERE

03:10:42.798 --> 03:10:43.431
THERE WERE YOU KNOW INNOVATION

03:10:43.498 --> 03:10:44.533
IS AN R. D. AS I'VE SAID BEFORE

03:10:44.599 --> 03:10:46.802
OF MANY MANY YEARS AND BEING

03:10:46.868 --> 03:10:47.402
OUT THIS FOR FORTY YEARS I CAN

03:10:47.469 --> 03:10:50.205
SAY THAT- BUT I DO THINK IT'S

03:10:50.272 --> 03:10:51.907
GOING TO BE A BALANCE OF ALL OF

03:10:51.973 --> 03:10:53.241
IT. AND I DON'T THINK IT'LL BE

03:10:53.308 --> 03:10:55.343
A SINGLE ANSWER AND I THINK WE

03:10:55.410 --> 03:10:56.812
WILL BE ABLE TO FIND THE RIGHT

03:10:56.878 --> 03:10:58.780
PATH. TO GET US THERE IN THE

03:10:58.847 --> 03:11:00.682
MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY-

03:11:00.749 --> 03:11:03.985
POSSIBLE. YEAH THANK YOU FOR

03:11:04.052 --> 03:11:05.554
THAT AND I GUESS YOU SEE. THE

03:11:05.620 --> 03:11:07.155
ISSUE IN THE FUTURE WITH PARK

03:11:07.222 --> 03:11:09.858
IF WE FAR FEWER- GAS OR DIESEL

03:11:09.925 --> 03:11:11.660
POWERED. VEHICLES ON THE ROAD I

03:11:11.726 --> 03:11:12.761

HYDROGEN OR- CCS FIVE FUELS IN

03:11:17.632 --> 03:11:18.166
THE FUTURE. BUT HOW HOW DO YOU

03:11:18.233 --> 03:11:20.402
THINK THE- INDUSTRY LOOKS LIKE

03:11:20.468 --> 03:11:22.504

A LOT OF THE SCENARIOS THAT

03:11:32.581 --> 03:11:33.582
SOME OF THE COMPANIES PUT

03:11:33.648 --> 03:11:35.283
TOGETHER WHETHER IT'S SHALL OR-

03:11:35.350 --> 03:11:37.886

WILL THESE TECHNOLOGIES REALLY

03:11:53.201 --> 03:11:54.002
TAKE OFF WHEN WILL THEY

03:11:54.069 --> 03:11:56.638
INTERSECT WHEN WILL NATURAL GAS

03:11:56.705 --> 03:11:57.372

03:12:13.321 --> 03:12:14.723
AN EXCITING TIME WE HAVE SO

03:12:14.789 --> 03:12:16.558
MUCH INNOVATION GOING ON. I

03:12:16.625 --> 03:12:18.560
THINK OUR INDUSTRY IS JUST

GOVERNOR PLANS TO BAN THE SALE

03:14:31.092 --> 03:14:32.460
OF INTERNAL COMBUSTION TO

03:14:32.527 --> 03:14:33.495
TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. WE'RE STILL

03:14:33.561 --> 03:14:34.396
GOING TO HAVE CLOSE TO THAT

IS A FACT THAT THIS STATE IS

03:14:52.013 --> 03:14:53.481
THE THIRD LARGEST CONSUMER OF

03:14:53.548 --> 03:14:54.816
TRANSPORTATION FUELS IN

03:14:54.883 --> 03:14:56.584
CALIFORNIA THAT'S ALL OF US.

STRIDES IN ELECT AND IN

03:15:11.232 --> 03:15:13.068
ELECTRIC VEHICLES. BUT WE STILL

03:15:13.134 --> 03:15:14.869
ONLY HAVE LESS THAN A HUNDRED

03:15:14.936 --> 03:15:16.237
THOUSAND OF THEM AND SO. THE

03:15:16.304 --> 03:15:18.139
TIMING OF THIS IS VERY VERY

03:15:18.206 --> 03:15:20.308
CRITICAL WE ARE TOTALLY

INVESTED IN MAKING LIQUID

03:15:21.609 --> 03:15:23.945
FUELS. AS CLEAN AS POSSIBLE.

03:15:24.012 --> 03:15:25.513
WE'RE TOTALLY INVESTED IN

03:15:25.580 --> 03:15:27.048
THINGS LIKE RENEWABLE NATURAL

03:15:27.115 --> 03:15:29.184
GAS RENEWABLE DIESEL HYDROGEN.

03:15:29.250 --> 03:15:32.287
WE ALSO ARE VERY INVESTED. IN

03:15:32.353 --> 03:15:33.388
AND FIVE THOUSAND THIS

THE GERMAN SUGGESTED. THE

03:15:38.359 --> 03:15:39.761
INNOVATIONS INITIATIVE WE PUT

03:15:39.828 --> 03:15:41.296
TOGETHER THAT CATALOGS WHAT

03:15:41.362 --> 03:15:43.331
THIS INDUSTRY IS DOING IN WIND

03:15:43.398 --> 03:15:44.766
AND SOLAR AND INVESTING IN

03:15:44.833 --> 03:15:46.868

OF THAT IS WONDERFUL OPTIMISTIC

03:15:53.575 --> 03:15:55.844
AND INNOVATIVE WHILE WE STILL

03:15:55.910 --> 03:15:57.745
HAVE TO KEEP ORDER FIRST AND

SOMEWHERE AND SO. IT IS YOU

03:16:03.952 --> 03:16:05.620
KNOW GASOLINE DIESEL JET FUEL

03:16:05.687 --> 03:16:06.855
ARE GOING TO BE WITH US TO YOUR

03:16:06.921 --> 03:16:12.193
POINT. FOR QUITE A WHILE AS

03:16:12.260 --> 03:16:13.294
WE'RE DOING THIS. AS FAST AS

03:16:13.361 --> 03:16:15.063
FAR. AND YOU'RE SEEING IT THE

03:16:15.130 --> 03:16:16.664
CAP AND TRADE. LOW CARBON FUEL

03:16:16.731 --> 03:16:18.600
STANDARD THEY ARE DELIVERING

03:16:18.666 --> 03:16:20.635
THE INNOVATIONS. YOU HAVE TO

03:16:20.702 --> 03:16:22.337
REFINERS- JUST CONVERTED A

03:16:22.403 --> 03:16:24.305
HYDROCARBON. BASED OUR

03:16:24.372 --> 03:16:26.274
REFINERIES IN THE BAY AREA TWO

03:16:26.341 --> 03:16:27.475
WERE LOCALS COMPLETELY

03:16:27.542 --> 03:16:29.844
RENEWABLES SO. THE INNOVATION

03:16:29.911 --> 03:16:31.679
IS STARTING IT IS IT IS

03:16:31.746 --> 03:16:34.115
HAPPENING YOU'VE GOT WONDERFUL

03:16:34.182 --> 03:16:35.884
INNOVATION HAPPENING WITH OUR

03:16:35.950 --> 03:16:37.552
OUR INDUSTRY IN THE CENTRAL

03:16:37.619 --> 03:16:39.254
VALLEY YOU'VE GOT CHEVRON AND

03:16:39.320 --> 03:16:41.089
SHELL. YOU KNOW AND NEW ENERGY

03:16:41.156 --> 03:16:43.224
AND MICROSOFT AND CLEAN ENERGY

03:16:43.291 --> 03:16:44.626
WHO JUST ANNOUNCED PLANS ON A

03:16:44.692 --> 03:16:47.562
BIOENERGY CCS PROJECT. TO GIVE

03:16:47.629 --> 03:16:48.563
CARBON NEGATIVE POWER TO

03:16:48.630 --> 03:16:51.166
MENDOTA. THAT'S EXCITING.

03:16:51.232 --> 03:16:53.768
YOU'VE GOT DODD C. R. C. WHO IS

03:16:53.835 --> 03:16:55.703
ANNOUNCED A SUSTAINABILITY GOAL

03:16:55.770 --> 03:16:58.406
TO CAPTURE THEIR CARBON FROM A

03:16:58.473 --> 03:16:59.073
FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY MEGAWATT

03:16:59.140 --> 03:17:01.042
POWER PLANT NOW KILLS SO. ALL

03:17:01.109 --> 03:17:03.645
OF THESE GET AT THE METRIC TONS

03:17:03.711 --> 03:17:06.047
THAT WE HAVE TO GET. IN A

03:17:06.114 --> 03:17:08.883
COMBINATION. OF EVERYTHING IN

03:17:08.950 --> 03:17:11.052
EVERY SECTOR SO. I HOPE THAT

03:17:11.119 --> 03:17:12.820
BEGINS TO ANSWERED I SEE GREAT

03:17:12.887 --> 03:17:14.422
INNOVATION FOR THE FUTURE I SEE

03:17:14.489 --> 03:17:17.225
OUR COMPANIES ALL OVER IT. AND

03:17:17.292 --> 03:17:19.661
IT'S EXCITING BUT WE ALSO HAVE

03:17:19.727 --> 03:17:21.296
TO REMEMBER WE GOT A LOT OF

03:17:21.362 --> 03:17:23.364
PEOPLE HERE. THAT WE ARE

03:17:23.431 --> 03:17:26.701
REQUIRED TO SUPPLY FUEL. IN ALL

03:17:26.768 --> 03:17:28.903
OF THESE SECTORS AND- YOU KNOW

03:17:28.970 --> 03:17:30.138
I THINK SOUTHWEST JUST

03:17:30.205 --> 03:17:31.839
ANNOUNCED THAT A GREAT THING

03:17:31.906 --> 03:17:33.174
FOR RENEWABLE JET FUEL SO

03:17:33.241 --> 03:17:35.310
AGAIN. SO MUCH GOING ON I'M

03:17:35.376 --> 03:17:37.111
VERY OPTIMISTIC BUT WE MUST

03:17:37.178 --> 03:17:39.247
KEEP A REALISTIC CONVERSATION

03:17:39.314 --> 03:17:40.181
GOING REAL TALK I THINK AS

03:17:40.248 --> 03:17:41.950
SOMEONE SAID EARLIER. ABOUT

03:17:42.016 --> 03:17:44.152
WHAT THE FACTS ARE OF WHERE WE

03:17:44.219 --> 03:17:45.486
ARE AND WHERE WE NEED TO GO.

03:17:45.553 --> 03:17:47.589
AGAIN IN THE FUTURE IF I CAN-

03:17:47.655 --> 03:17:50.091
KATHY THANK YOU FOR THAT- I

03:17:50.158 --> 03:17:52.994
KNOW- YOU KNOW FOR ME BECAUSE A

03:17:53.061 --> 03:17:54.929
LOT OF FOLKS IN MY- DISTRICT IN

03:17:54.996 --> 03:17:56.965
MY REGION THE DRIVE GAS POWERED

03:17:57.031 --> 03:17:58.299
VEHICLES I DO BOTH OF MY

03:17:58.366 --> 03:17:59.701
VEHICLES ARE BOTH GAS. A GAS

03:17:59.767 --> 03:18:02.003
POWERED. I'M SO EVERY TIME I GO

03:18:02.070 --> 03:18:02.904
TO THE GAS TANK AND I AND I

03:18:02.971 --> 03:18:04.439
PHILIP. IT'S THE MISSIONS THAT

03:18:04.505 --> 03:18:05.440
ARE COMING OUT OF MY TAIL PIPE

03:18:05.506 --> 03:18:11.079
THAT I AM I'M ACTUALLY PUTTING.

03:18:11.145 --> 03:18:11.613
CARBON INTO THE ATMOSPHERE

03:18:11.679 --> 03:18:12.680
THAT'S THAT'S ON. A FOR- FOR

03:18:12.747 --> 03:18:13.314
DOING I THINK WE ALL HAVE TO.

03:18:13.381 --> 03:18:13.915
HAVE TO RELY BUT I DON'T HAVE

03:18:13.982 --> 03:18:15.250
ANOTHER OPTION BECAUSE I DON'T

03:18:15.316 --> 03:18:16.818
HAVE. AN ELECTRIC POWERED

03:18:16.884 --> 03:18:18.786
POWERED VEHICLE- AND IF I CAN

03:18:18.853 --> 03:18:20.788
ASK MAYBE DIFFICULT QUESTION-

03:18:20.855 --> 03:18:23.157
BECAUSE- YOU KNOW I WAS- IN

03:18:23.224 --> 03:18:25.927
CONSERVATIVE POLITICS- BACK IN.

03:18:25.994 --> 03:18:28.263
THE NINETEEN NINETIES- AND I

03:18:28.329 --> 03:18:29.931
REMEMBER BACK IN THE NINETEEN

03:18:29.998 --> 03:18:31.466
NINETIES. I THAT THERE WAS AN

03:18:31.532 --> 03:18:33.835
AWFUL LOT OF TALK IN FACT HAD

03:18:33.901 --> 03:18:35.937
SEVERAL FRIENDS. THAT WORKED

03:18:36.004 --> 03:18:37.472
FOR DIFFERENT GROUPS- THAT

03:18:37.538 --> 03:18:39.073
WE'RE TRYING TO SKEW. OF THE

03:18:39.140 --> 03:18:41.542
PUBLIC RELATIONS IN REGARDS TO-

03:18:41.609 --> 03:18:43.911
THE QUESTION OF CLIMATE CHANGE-

03:18:43.978 --> 03:18:45.913
I KNOW THAT- THE OIL ALMOND BIG

03:18:45.980 --> 03:18:47.749
OIL BIG OIL'S REALLY BAD I

03:18:47.815 --> 03:18:48.816
GUESS BIG WHEELS REALLY BAD

03:18:48.883 --> 03:18:49.784
ALTHOUGH I USED A PRODUCT BIG

03:18:49.851 --> 03:18:51.653
WHEELS REALLY BAD- BUT IN THAT.

03:18:51.719 --> 03:18:54.188
IT IN THE NINETIES- A BIG OIL

03:18:54.255 --> 03:18:56.124
WAS FUNDING- SOME OF THAT WE

03:18:56.190 --> 03:18:56.858
KNOW THAT WE KNOW THAT THAT IS

03:18:56.924 --> 03:19:00.628
THAT IS TRUE. I MYSELF- IN THE

03:19:00.695 --> 03:19:01.162
NINETEEN NINETIES DID NOT

03:19:01.229 --> 03:19:02.563
BELIEVE THAT CLIMATE CHANGE.

03:19:02.630 --> 03:19:04.265
WAS WAS REAL THE IN THE TWO

03:19:04.332 --> 03:19:06.167
THOUSANDS I DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT

03:19:06.234 --> 03:19:08.469
CLIMATE CHANGE. I WAS REAL OF

03:19:08.536 --> 03:19:10.338
COURSE IS A MANY ARE AWARE- I

03:19:10.405 --> 03:19:11.372
ENDED UP HAVING SORT OF A

03:19:11.439 --> 03:19:13.074
RECKONING AFTER I WENT LOOKED

03:19:13.141 --> 03:19:13.841
AT THE SCIENCE MYSELF AND SAID

03:19:13.908 --> 03:19:15.543
NO ACTUALLY. THIS IS SOMETHING

03:19:15.610 --> 03:19:16.711
THAT'S VERY REAL WE HAVE

03:19:16.778 --> 03:19:18.246
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THAT

03:19:18.313 --> 03:19:20.815
ARE INCREASING IT'S MY BEHAVIOR

03:19:20.882 --> 03:19:23.751
THAT IS CAUSING- THAT- AND-

03:19:23.818 --> 03:19:26.087
I'VE COME TO THE REALIZATION-

03:19:26.154 --> 03:19:27.855
OR EVOLUTION YOU MIGHT SAY.

03:19:27.922 --> 03:19:29.290
THAT I HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO

03:19:29.357 --> 03:19:30.958
BE ABLE TO DO THAT TO DO

03:19:31.025 --> 03:19:32.660
SOMETHING ABOUT IT. I'VE ALSO

03:19:32.727 --> 03:19:35.029
SEEN THAT- WITH. WITH BIG OIL

03:19:35.096 --> 03:19:37.065
AS WELL. IN FACT A COUPLE YEARS

03:19:37.131 --> 03:19:39.567
AGO I REMEMBER BEING- IN- IN

03:19:39.634 --> 03:19:41.636
THE NETHERLANDS. ACT THAT DOES

03:19:41.703 --> 03:19:43.404
SHOW FOR THE RESEARCH FACILITY

03:19:43.471 --> 03:19:45.606
AND I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE. THAT

03:19:45.673 --> 03:19:47.975
A COMPANY LIKE SHELL WAS SAYING

03:19:48.042 --> 03:19:49.210
THAT THERE'S GOT TO BE THAT WE

03:19:49.277 --> 03:19:51.012
ARE PART OF THE PROBLEM- AND

03:19:51.079 --> 03:19:51.913
WE'VE GOT ALSO GOT TO BE PART

03:19:51.979 --> 03:19:53.481
OF THE SOLUTION IN FACT WE'RE

03:19:53.548 --> 03:19:54.816
TALK TALKING ABOUT AN

03:19:54.882 --> 03:19:55.650
INTERNATIONAL GLOBAL PRICE ON

03:19:55.717 --> 03:19:57.185
CARBON. IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY

03:19:57.251 --> 03:19:59.087
IS LIKE FIFTY DOLLARS SO IT

03:19:59.153 --> 03:20:00.321
SEEMS TO ME THAT BIG OIL'S COME

03:20:00.388 --> 03:20:02.256
AROUND TO THIS IDEA. THAT

03:20:02.323 --> 03:20:04.258
SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE AND SO

03:20:04.325 --> 03:20:06.561
IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE MAYBE A FOR

03:20:06.627 --> 03:20:10.465
US AS POLICYMAKERS. INSTEAD OF

03:20:10.531 --> 03:20:10.965
THINKING OF BIG WELL THE

03:20:11.032 --> 03:20:11.733
PROBLEM MAYBE WE- ALL. THINK OF

03:20:11.799 --> 03:20:12.867
BIG OIL AS MAYBE PART OF THE

03:20:12.934 --> 03:20:14.435
SOLUTION. AS WELL TO HELPS

TRULY BELIEVE WE ALMOST HAVE A

03:21:34.048 --> 03:21:36.050
SEAT AT THE TABLE TO MAKE SURE

03:21:36.117 --> 03:21:38.419

INDUSTRY CERTAINLY DOESN'T AND

03:21:46.227 --> 03:21:48.696
BUT WE DO BRING TO THE TABLE IN

03:21:48.763 --> 03:21:50.965
MY OPINION. JUST AMAZING

TOGETHER SO I'M- THAT'S MY

03:21:57.038 --> 03:21:59.106
OPTIMISTIC SIDE AND THEN MY

03:21:59.173 --> 03:22:01.075
PRAGMATIC SIDE IS TO JUST MAKE

03:22:01.142 --> 03:22:03.177
SURE WE ARE LOOKING AT THE

03:22:03.244 --> 03:22:04.779
FACTS OF THE SITUATION WHERE WE

03:22:04.846 --> 03:22:05.847
ARE WHERE WE NEED TO GO

03:22:05.913 --> 03:22:08.182
BECAUSE- IT ISN'T EASY. WE JUST

03:22:08.249 --> 03:22:09.851
CANNOT SWITCH OFF YOU KNOW FLIP

03:22:09.917 --> 03:22:11.285

WE ARE AND WHERE WE NEED TO GO

03:22:17.592 --> 03:22:19.026

03:22:19.093 --> 03:22:20.528
SCOPING PLAN IS A GOOD ONE IT

03:22:20.595 --> 03:22:22.096
