00:15:19.485 --> 00:15:22.054
REQUIRED NOW- WE'RE CERTAINLY

00:15:22.121 --> 00:15:23.822
URGING THEM AND THEY THEY- SAY

00:15:23.889 --> 00:15:25.758
THEY'VE BEEN CLEAR THAT. IT WAS

00:15:25.824 --> 00:15:28.327
REQUIRED ALL ALONG- AND THAT

00:15:28.394 --> 00:15:30.529
THAT THAT THIS IS AN ALTERNATIVE

00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:32.898
THAT- EVERYONE SHOULD VERY MUCH

00:15:32.965 --> 00:15:35.401
AVAIL THEMSELVES TO WORK. WHEN I

00:15:35.467 --> 00:15:36.702
CLEAR GUIDANCE WAS ALWAYS- CLEAR

00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:38.070
IN THE PAST FROM DOJ WERE

00:15:38.137 --> 00:15:39.672
STRONGLY URGING THEM TO.

00:15:39.738 --> 00:15:41.440
CONTINUE TO CLARIFY GOING

00:15:41.507 --> 00:15:44.443
FORWARD- BUT THEY HAVEN'T SAID

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:46.578
OR NO ONE HAS SAID THAT THERE'S

00:15:46.645 --> 00:15:49.915
ANY. SITUATION WHERE YOU NEED TO

00:15:49.982 --> 00:15:51.583
HAVE FOR CORRUPTION. I'M I

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:53.352
SUPPORT THE BILL AND- WHEN IT'S

00:15:53.419 --> 00:15:55.487
APPROPRIATE I WOULD MOVE IT.

00:15:55.554 --> 00:15:59.692
THANK YOU SENATOR TROUBLED- GOOD

00:15:59.758 --> 00:16:00.626
MORNING THANK YOU TO MISTER

00:16:00.693 --> 00:16:02.961
CHAIR AND- THANK YOU SENATOR

00:16:03.028 --> 00:16:04.363
BAKER FOR BRINGING THIS BILL

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:08.567
FORWARD- BEING THAT I AM NOT AN

00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:10.269
pEXPERT IN OUR PUBLIC SAFETY AND

00:16:10.336 --> 00:16:11.970
LEARNING QUITE A BIT. I DO HAVE

00:16:12.037 --> 00:16:13.839
SOME WRITTEN STATEMENTS HERE

00:16:13.906 --> 00:16:16.208
THAT I WOULD LIKE TO- PUT IN THE

00:16:16.275 --> 00:16:19.645
RECORD. AND FIRST OF ALL MOST

00:16:19.712 --> 00:16:21.246
STRONG BELIEVER THE FIRST

00:16:21.313 --> 00:16:23.449
AMENDMENT VERY VERY MUCH SO AND

00:16:23.515 --> 00:16:24.683
I DO BELIEVE THAT OUR

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:26.218
JOURNALISTS PLAIN IMPORTANT

00:16:26.285 --> 00:16:27.152
PUBLIC SAFETY ROLE IN OUR

00:16:27.219 --> 00:16:29.054
SOCIETY AND I BELIEVE OUR

00:16:29.121 --> 00:16:30.222
CITIZENS HAVE A RIGHT TO

00:16:30.289 --> 00:16:31.890
REASONABLE ACCESS FOR PUBLICLY

00:16:31.957 --> 00:16:34.793
FUNDED INSTITUTIONS. HOWEVER I

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.762
DO BELIEVE THAT OUR SMALLER

00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:37.896
POLICE DEPARTMENTS WHO HAVE

00:16:37.963 --> 00:16:40.132
SPENT A LOT OF MONEY. UPGRADING

00:16:40.199 --> 00:16:41.834
THEIR SYSTEMS FOLLOWING THE

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:42.534
TWENTY TWENTY MEMO FROM THE

00:16:42.601 --> 00:16:44.536
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAVE A

00:16:44.603 --> 00:16:46.038
LEGITIMATE CONCERN. OVER THE

00:16:46.105 --> 00:16:47.806
ABILITY TO INSTITUTE ANOTHER

00:16:47.873 --> 00:16:51.143
OVERHAUL. TO THEIR SYSTEMS.

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:52.578
CHANGE IT BACK TO THE F.

00:16:52.644 --> 00:16:54.580
TWINNING CRYPTID SYSTEM AS WELL

00:16:54.646 --> 00:16:56.382
AS THE CLUB'S PRIVATE CHANNEL

00:16:56.448 --> 00:17:01.086
WOULD BE EXTREMELY COSTLY. FOR-

00:17:01.153 --> 00:17:02.855
AND DIFFICULT FOR OUR POLICE

00:17:02.921 --> 00:17:04.957
DEPARTMENTS TO IMPLEMENT I DO

00:17:05.023 --> 00:17:07.226
UNDERSTAND THAT THE CHP HAS BEEN

00:17:07.292 --> 00:17:08.327
ABLE TO DEVELOP A MORE NEW

00:17:08.394 --> 00:17:10.529
WINCED OUR SYSTEM THAT THREAD

00:17:10.596 --> 00:17:11.563
THE NEEDLE BETWEEN PRIVACY

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:13.132
CONCERNS AND LEGITIMATE PUBLIC

00:17:13.198 --> 00:17:15.968
ACCESS. THE CHP IS A STATEWIDE

00:17:16.034 --> 00:17:17.369
ORGANIZATION WITH CONSIDERABLE

00:17:17.436 --> 00:17:19.772
MORE FUNDING THAN MANY OF OUR

00:17:19.838 --> 00:17:20.739
LOCAL DEPARTMENTS WHO STRUGGLE

00:17:20.806 --> 00:17:22.307
TO MAKE ENDS MEET. AND HAVE YOU

00:17:22.374 --> 00:17:23.742
CONSIDERED A FUNDED PILOT

00:17:23.809 --> 00:17:25.043
PROGRAM FOR POLICE DEPARTMENTS

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:26.445
TO LOOK AT THE BEST WAY TO

00:17:26.512 --> 00:17:27.579
IMPLEMENT A MORE BALANCED

00:17:27.646 --> 00:17:29.915
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM SIMILAR TO

00:17:29.982 --> 00:17:32.117
WHAT THE CHP HAS. BEEN ABLE TO

00:17:32.184 --> 00:17:34.086
ACCOMPLISH SO THAT THERE IS A

00:17:34.153 --> 00:17:35.754
MODEL FOR SMALLER DEPARTMENTS TO

00:17:35.821 --> 00:17:38.190
FOLLOW. WELL I THINK ONE OF THE

00:17:38.257 --> 00:17:39.525
- THROUGH FRIDAY DRESS HERE IS

00:17:39.591 --> 00:17:41.560
THAT IT'S ACTUALLY MUCH CHEAPER

00:17:41.627 --> 00:17:43.228
TO NOT FULLY CRAP SO FOR EXAMPLE

00:17:43.295 --> 00:17:47.232
SAN BRUNO IN MY- IN MY DISTRICT

00:17:47.299 --> 00:17:49.268
IS REACHING OUT FOR FIVE MILLION

00:17:49.334 --> 00:17:50.436
DOLLARS TO MOVE IN LARGE PART

00:17:50.502 --> 00:17:52.471
JUST TO MOVE TO A- FULL QUESTION

00:17:52.538 --> 00:17:53.705
BECAUSE THAT WAS THEIR

00:17:53.772 --> 00:17:55.507
INTERPRETATION OF THE DOJ MEMO.

00:17:55.574 --> 00:17:57.142
AND WHICH IS WHAT WE THINK DJ

00:17:57.209 --> 00:17:58.544
CLARIFYING THAT EARLIER WOULD BE

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:00.712
WOULD BE BETTER- BUT THAT'S-

00:18:00.779 --> 00:18:02.381
SWEAT WHILE WE THINK THIS BILL

00:18:02.448 --> 00:18:03.882
IS NECESSARY BECAUSE WE TELL

00:18:03.949 --> 00:18:05.117
THEM- IT WAS REALLY OUR JOB TO

00:18:05.184 --> 00:18:06.785
TELL THEM THAT- ACTUALLY YOU

00:18:06.852 --> 00:18:08.153
PROBABLY DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:10.088
RIGHT AND THAT IF I DON'T SPEND

00:18:10.155 --> 00:18:11.623
ANYTHING. AND IT'S ACTUALLY VERY

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:13.125
CHEAP WAYS TO MOVE FORWARD AND

00:18:13.192 --> 00:18:14.526
JUST MAKE SURE LIKE CHP HAS

00:18:14.593 --> 00:18:16.428
DONE- TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:18:16.495 --> 00:18:17.196
PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE

00:18:17.262 --> 00:18:18.931
INFORMATION IS NOT GOING OUT

00:18:18.997 --> 00:18:21.767
THERE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF. OF

00:18:21.834 --> 00:18:23.435
OF WAYS TO DO THAT SO I

00:18:23.502 --> 00:18:24.436
APPRECIATE YOUR SUGGESTION BUT I

00:18:24.503 --> 00:18:26.238
THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR LOOKING

00:18:26.305 --> 00:18:28.373
CHP WORK YOU KNOW MANY OTHER

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.242
AGENCIES WERE DOING AT THAT

00:18:30.309 --> 00:18:32.211
THERE ARE WAYS TO JUST MAKE SURE

00:18:32.277 --> 00:18:33.445
THE PERSONAL INFORMATION DOESN'T

00:18:33.512 --> 00:18:35.380
GO OUT. ON UNDER THE CURRENT

00:18:35.447 --> 00:18:36.482
CURRENT CHANNEL SO I DON'T I

00:18:36.548 --> 00:18:38.550
PIECES YES I DON'T THINK WE NEED

00:18:38.617 --> 00:18:41.353
A PILOT TO SHOW THAT- AND I

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:42.354
THINK THIS BILL IS NEEDED

00:18:42.421 --> 00:18:44.022
BECAUSE ONE MAKE SURE MORE

00:18:44.089 --> 00:18:45.123
POLICE DEPARTMENT DOES BUT ALL

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:47.025
THE MONEY TO MOVE TO FOREIGN

00:18:47.092 --> 00:18:48.026
CORRUPTION WHICH- AGAIN WE THINK

00:18:48.093 --> 00:18:51.296
IT'S NOT NECESSARY AND- HARMFUL

00:18:51.363 --> 00:18:53.065
TO THE PUBLIC. THEN I HAVE. ONE

00:18:53.131 --> 00:18:54.466
MORE QUESTION SIR MISTER CHAIR.

00:18:54.533 --> 00:18:55.968
I'M ALSO. MY UNDERSTANDING THAT

00:18:56.034 --> 00:18:59.071
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE SCANNERS THAT

00:18:59.137 --> 00:19:02.307
CAN MONITOR- READER TRAFFIC PLUS

00:19:02.374 --> 00:19:04.276
WHAT NARCOTICS AND GANG UNITS

00:19:04.343 --> 00:19:05.210
USED ENCRYPTION DURING THEIR

00:19:05.277 --> 00:19:07.679
OPERATIONS- AND THEN THEY CAN

00:19:07.746 --> 00:19:10.749
ALSO SUBPOENA RADIO TRAFFIC AS

00:19:10.816 --> 00:19:12.718
WELL SO THE PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY

00:19:12.784 --> 00:19:13.986
HAVE ACCESS TO ALL OF THIS

00:19:14.052 --> 00:19:15.187
INFORMATION BASED ON MANY

00:19:15.254 --> 00:19:18.056
SCANNERS. I WAS ADVISED TO GO

00:19:18.123 --> 00:19:19.224
INTO THE APP STORE AND SEE HOW

00:19:19.291 --> 00:19:21.159
MANY AT LEAST SCANNERS WERE

00:19:21.226 --> 00:19:24.296
AVAILABLE- FOR PEOPLE TO USE AN

00:19:24.363 --> 00:19:26.465
EVERYDAY BASIS AND THE CONCERN

00:19:26.532 --> 00:19:28.433
THAT HAS ARISEN IS THAT WE DON'T

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.869
WANT TO MAKE IT A LITTLE EASIER

00:19:30.936 --> 00:19:33.539
TO HAVE. THE VARIOUS ACTORS NO

00:19:33.605 --> 00:19:36.174
WITH THE MOVE BY MOVE OR AFP OUT

00:19:36.241 --> 00:19:37.643
YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION OR

00:19:37.709 --> 00:19:39.211
STRATEGY INFORMATION BY OUR

00:19:39.278 --> 00:19:41.980
POLICE DEPARTMENTS GIVE ANY

00:19:42.047 --> 00:19:43.048
FEEDBACK ON THE- BUT MIGHT ASK

00:19:43.115 --> 00:19:44.850
MORE MY WITNESSES WOULD LIKE TO

00:19:44.917 --> 00:19:46.151
COMMENT I THINK IT'S EASIER FOR

00:19:46.218 --> 00:19:47.819
YOUR FIRST POINT- I THINK WITH

00:19:47.886 --> 00:19:49.288
FOR CORRUPTION THE PUBLIC'S NOT

00:19:49.354 --> 00:19:51.123
GETTING INFORMATION AND I THINK

00:19:51.189 --> 00:19:53.392
THE WITNESSES. THAT COULD SPEAK

00:19:53.458 --> 00:19:56.595
TO THAT- IN TERMS OF- YOU KNOW.

00:19:56.662 --> 00:19:59.131
BAD ACTORS I THINK WHAT I THINK

00:19:59.197 --> 00:20:00.966
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THEY CAN

00:20:01.033 --> 00:20:02.234
BE THE BAD ACTORS CAN GET

00:20:02.301 --> 00:20:03.435
INFORMATION WHETHER CERTAIN

00:20:03.502 --> 00:20:04.670
GROUPS THAT ARE NOT- SO I CAN'T

00:20:04.736 --> 00:20:06.104
QUITE COMMENT ON THAT I DON'T

00:20:06.171 --> 00:20:08.073
THINK. I DON'T THINK THAT THIS

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:10.409
BILL WILL- AGAIN BECAUSE WE MAKE

00:20:10.475 --> 00:20:12.778
SURE PERCENT AFFIRMATION IS NOT.

00:20:12.844 --> 00:20:16.248
IS NOT GETTING OUT- WE'LL BE ANY

00:20:16.315 --> 00:20:17.215
WILL CREATE ANY ADDITIONAL

00:20:17.282 --> 00:20:19.318
DANGERS TO. TO THE TO THE PUBLIC

00:20:19.384 --> 00:20:23.055
BUT BUT JUST WHEN THE WITNESSES

00:20:23.121 --> 00:20:24.156
ONE ADDRESS EITHER EITHER THOSE

00:20:24.222 --> 00:20:25.924
POINTS. JENNIFER FEEL LIKE I

00:20:25.991 --> 00:20:27.593
WOULD SIMPLY SAY I THINK YOU

00:20:27.659 --> 00:20:29.494
KNOW YOU'VE HAD IT SPOT ON

00:20:29.561 --> 00:20:30.929
YOU'RE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT

00:20:30.996 --> 00:20:32.931
AND YOUR ASSESSMENT I'M HAPPY TO

00:20:32.998 --> 00:20:36.134
EXPLORE THIS TOPIC FURTHER IF

00:20:36.201 --> 00:20:37.402
YOU HAVE MORE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS

00:20:37.469 --> 00:20:41.740
ABOUT IT. BRITAIN'S GOOD MORNING

00:20:41.807 --> 00:20:45.611
AND- SO AS TO THE LATTER PART OF

00:20:45.677 --> 00:20:47.512
THE QUESTION THERE WAS ASKED

00:20:47.579 --> 00:20:49.915
ABOUT- NEFARIOUS ACTORS BEING

00:20:49.982 --> 00:20:51.516
ABLE TO MONITOR SO THE BILL

00:20:51.583 --> 00:20:52.684
LANGUAGE DOES CONTAIN AN

00:20:52.751 --> 00:20:54.519
EXEMPTION FOR UNDERCOVER

00:20:54.586 --> 00:20:56.722
OPERATIONS AND OTHER ISSUES-

00:20:56.788 --> 00:20:58.457
ISSUES THAT WOULD BE COVERED I

00:20:58.523 --> 00:20:59.791
BELIEVE UNDER YOUR QUESTIONS SO

00:20:59.858 --> 00:21:01.226
THAT'S A DRESSED IN THE BILL

00:21:01.293 --> 00:21:02.861
LANGUAGE HOW DOES THAT ACTUALLY

00:21:02.928 --> 00:21:06.865
LOOK I APOLOGIZE. THAT THIS

00:21:06.932 --> 00:21:08.233
REPORT BUT YES OUR FOOTFALL.

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:12.704
YOUR SO HOW DOES THAT LOOK IN

00:21:12.771 --> 00:21:13.305
PRACTICE HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY

00:21:13.372 --> 00:21:15.307
PROTECTIVE GEAR HAVE RIDDLED THE

00:21:15.374 --> 00:21:19.711
AXIS AND HOW DOES THAT. RETIRED

00:21:19.778 --> 00:21:21.613
ACTUAL PRACTICE THE PEOPLE WHO

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:27.386
ARE UNDER COVER OR- ATTACKED.

00:21:27.452 --> 00:21:28.587
THE SYSTEM FROM THE VARIOUS

00:21:28.654 --> 00:21:32.257
ACTORS. SO TO BE FAIR I'M NOT AN

00:21:32.324 --> 00:21:34.126
EXPERT ON THE POLICE END OF

00:21:34.192 --> 00:21:36.328
THINGS- WE ARE NEWS

00:21:36.395 --> 00:21:37.763
ORGANIZATIONS MONITOR THE

00:21:37.829 --> 00:21:39.297
ENCRYPTION FOR THE PENAL CODE

00:21:39.364 --> 00:21:41.833
DOES ALSO MAKE IT A CRIME TO

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:44.169
SHARE ANY INFORMATION THAT'S

00:21:44.236 --> 00:21:46.171
ONGOING THAT WOULD AID IN

00:21:46.238 --> 00:21:47.873
CRIMINAL ACTIVITY THAT'S AN

00:21:47.939 --> 00:21:50.709
EXISTING LAW WASN'T NOTED IN THE

00:21:50.776 --> 00:21:53.512
ANALYSIS. I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT

00:21:53.578 --> 00:21:54.780
PERSPECTIVE BUT IN PRACTICE WHEN

00:21:54.846 --> 00:21:56.114
YOU WANT TO HAVE READILY

00:21:56.181 --> 00:21:58.684
AVAILABLE INFORMATION IT'S JUST

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:00.585
ME I JUST WOULD LIKE TO SEE HOW.

00:22:00.652 --> 00:22:03.055
THE SYSTEM IN PLACE TO BE-

00:22:03.121 --> 00:22:05.257
PROTECTED FROM HAVING FULL

00:22:05.323 --> 00:22:07.526
ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION AS ITS

00:22:07.592 --> 00:22:10.362
ON GOING. LIVE FROM THE

00:22:10.429 --> 00:22:11.663
NEFARIOUS ACTORS KNOWING THIS

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:13.398
THE STEP BY STEP STRATEGIES FIRE

00:22:13.465 --> 00:22:16.334
PUBLIC SAFETY. I JUST I I'M ALL

00:22:16.401 --> 00:22:18.170
ABOUT THE FIRST AMENDMENT BUT

00:22:18.236 --> 00:22:20.238
I'M ALSO WHEN IT COMES TO PUBLIC

00:22:20.305 --> 00:22:22.007
SAFETY- BOTH LOCAL AND FEDERAL

00:22:22.074 --> 00:22:23.975
I'M VERY VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT

00:22:24.042 --> 00:22:25.343
PROTECTING BOTH THE INDIVIDUALS
