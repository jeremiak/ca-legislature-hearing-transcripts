I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR TIME IN CONSIDERATION OF THIS BILL CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA IS ONLY ONE OF THREE STATES THAT REQUIRES HEALTH PROVIDERS TO REPORT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT IF THEY'RE TREATING PATIENTS FOR A BROAD RANGE OF VIOLENT PHYSICAL INJURIES. EVEN IF THE PATIENT DOES NOT WANT THE REPORT TO BE MADE THE CURRENT STATUTE COVERS A BROAD RANGE OF PHYSICAL INJURIES AND THIS STATUTE IS OVERWHELMINGLY IN EXCLUSIVELY APPLIED TO SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT FEAR OF MANDATORY REPORTING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT HAVE KEPT SURVIVORS FROM SEEKING HEALTH CARE ENSURING INFORMATION WITH THEIR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. IN ADDITION SURVEYS HAVE SHOWN THAT 51% OF SURVIVORS STATED THAT MANDATORY REPORTING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT ME THEIR SITUATIONS WORSE AND ANOTHER 32% STATED THAT IT EITHER MADE THINGS WORSE OR DID NOT HELP THEM AT ALL. AB TWENTY SEVEN NINETY WILL MODERNIZE CALIFORNIA'S MEDICAL MANDATING REPORTING. BY REMOVING THE LEGISLATIVE MANDATE TO REPORT. TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OLY REQUIRING FIRE ARM INJURIES. TO REPORT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. THIS BILL WILL INSTEAD MANDATE THAT HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. PROVIDE REFERRALS TO COMMUNITY BASED A NATIONAL DOMESTIC AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND ADVOCACY SERVICES. TO BE CLEAR CHANGES TO THE STATUE WILL NOT AFFECT MANDATED REPORTING WITH REGARD TO CHILD ABUSE AND ELDER ABUSE. STATUTES MOREOVER THIS BILL DOES NOT TAKE AWAY THE OPTION TO REPORT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. PATIENTS CAN STILL MAKE REPORT ON FORSMAN ASK THEIR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS TO REPORT. IF THAT IS WHAT THEY CHOOSE. THIS BILL IS ABOUT ENSURING THAT SURVIVORS HAVE THE AGENCY AND INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED TO BE SAFE AND HEALTHY. I WANT TO THANK OUR SPONSORS FUTURES WITHOUT VIOLENCE ALLIANCE FOR BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR. AND THE UC IRVINE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LAW CLINIC. I WILL LET MY WITNESSES ITSELF INTRODUCED AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU- YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES- DIVVIED UP ANYWAY RELY. I'M SURE JONES SAWYER. BUT TO MY OTHER MY CONFRONTED THE- I'M SURE JONES SAWYER SENIOR AND OTHER MEMBERS OF PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU MY NAME IS DOCTOR LEE KIMBER I'M A PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO AND A SAFETY NET PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER- WITH TWENTY SIX YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IMPLEMENTING AND EVALUATING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH CARE. I'M HERE TO SHARE MY ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPORTANCE OF AB TWO SEVEN NINE NO IN IMPROVING THE SAFETY AND HEALTH OF PEOPLE SURVIVING DOMESTIC AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN CALIFORNIA I'LL HIGHLIGHT THREE ISSUES FIRST MANDATORY REPORT TO TURNER'S DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DV SURVIVORS FROM SEEKING HEALTH CARE AND DISCLOSING VIOLENCE IN OUR STUDY IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. OF PEACE THANKS TO MERGING SEA DEPARTMENT PATIENTS IN SAN FRANCISCO AND OAKLAND WE FOUND THAT OUR RESPONDENTS STATED THAT ALMOST HALF OF THE DV SURVIVORS THAT THEY KNEW YOU WERE AFRAID TO SPEAK HEALTH CARE AND THAT MANY OF THE FEARFUL NEVER SOUGHT HEALTH CARE DUE TO FEAR THE TOP TWO FEARS THAT THEY NAMED WHERE THE DV SURVIVORS FEAR THE DOCTOR ACCORDING TO THE POLICE AND THE PERSON PERPETRATING THE DV FINDING OUT ABOUT THE DISCLOSURE. IN MY PRACTICE WHEN I SHARED MY REPORTING OBLIGATIONS WITH A SURVIVOR OF SEXUAL ASSAULT SHE REFUSED AN EXAMINATION NEVER RETURNED TO OUR HEALTH CENTER AGAIN. SECOND MANDATORY REPORTING IS MOST OFTEN I THEY'RE NOT HELPFUL OR EVEN HARMFUL AND THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT MANDATORY REPORTING OF INJURIES REDUCES VIOLENCE THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION AND THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION STRONGLY RECOMMEND AGAINST HEALTH CARE MANDATORY REPORTING LAWS THIRD THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM CAN IMPROVE THE SAFETY OF SURVIVORS WITHOUT MANDATORY REPORTING. IS CURRENTLY OTHER STATES AND ON FOR AN INJURED PATIENTS IN CALIFORNIA WE CAN RESPECT SURVIVOR AGENCY AND SHARE SAFETY PROMOTING OPTIONS AND REFERRALS COMPASSIONATELY AND CONFIDENTIALLY A SURVIVOR AND ONE OF OUR STUDY SHARED- THEN THERE WAS MY DOCTOR WHO CONNECTED ME WITH ADVOCATE IT FELT LIKE THE DOCTORS WERE ALL LISTENING AND TRY TO GET A S. WHATEVER. WE NEEDED THAT'S WHY SHE HAD THE ADVOCATE COME IN AND TALK TO ME I FELT CARED FOR THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE TODAY. MY NAME IS PAT LEFT LOTUS AND I OVERSEE INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE SEXUAL ASSAULT AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING SERVICES FOR COMMUTE SOLUTIONS AND MULTISERVICE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION AND SANTA CLARA COUNTY. I HAVE WORKED IN THE ANTI GENDER BASED VIOLENCE FIELD FOR ALMOST TWENTY YEARS AND HAVE WITNESSED HOW MEDICAL MANDATED REPORTING DETER SURVIVORS FROM SEEKING MEDICAL CARE DUE TO FEAR OF LAW ENFORCEMENT INVOLVEMENT. THIS FEAR IS AMPLIFIED FOR SURVIVORS WITHOUT LEGAL STATUS. AB TWENTY SEVEN NINETY IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS REMOVING BARRIERS THAT HINDER SURVIVORS FROM ACCESSING MEDICAL CARE. THIS BILL NEITHER TAKES AWAY SURVIVORS OPTION TO CALL LAW ENFORCEMENT NOR DOES IT PROHIBIT MEDICAL PROVIDERS FROM REPORTING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. SURVIVORS ARE MORE LIKELY TO REPORT ABUSE CANDIDLY TO PER CONFIDENTIAL PROVIDERS. LAST YEAR A REVIEW DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DANGER ASSESSMENTS CONDUCTED BY CONFIDENTIAL ADVOCATES AND FOUND THAT 42% OF VICTIMS SHARE THAT THEY HAD BEEN STRANGLED BY THEIR PARTNER OR EX PARTNER. I ALSO REVIEWED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE POLICE REPORTS FROM THE SAME TIME PERIOD AND THE PUT THAT THEY SHOW THAT ROUGHLY 13% OF VICTIMS REPORTED TO THE POLICE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN STRANGLED BY THEIR PARTNER OR EX PARTNER. SOME SURVIVORS WILL EVEN REFUSE CRITICAL MEDICAL CARE TO AVOID INVOLVEMENT WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. A TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD WOMAN WE WORKED WITH WAS RAPED AND STRANGLED BY HER STEPBROTHER. SHE URGENTLY NEEDED MEDICAL CARE BUT FEAR POLICE INVOLVEMENT. AFTER SEVERAL DAYS OF DEALING WITH BREATHING ISSUES THE SURVIVOR HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION DESPITE NOT WANTING THIS INCIDENT REPORTED AND THE AFTERMATH THAT CAME WITH IT. THIS TYPE OF DELAYED MEDICAL CARE CAN BE LIFE THREATNING. AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHT SEP TWENTY SEVEN NINETY AIMS TO UPLIFT SURVIVOR SAFETY METONYMY AN AGENCY. THROUGH INCREASED ACCESS TO MEDICAL CARE AND COMPREHENSIVE SUPPORT. UPLIFTING SURVIVORS REQUIRE SURVIVOR CENTERED COLLABORATIVE INTERSECTIONAL STRATEGIES THAT PRIORITIZE SURVIVORS VOICE IN CHOICE. AND EXTEND BEYOND A CRIMINAL SYSTEM APPROACH. THESE STRATEGIES INCLUDE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PRACTICES AND COMMUNITY BASED ALTERNATIVES TO LAW ENFORCEMENT INTERVENTIONS. PLEASE SUPPORT AB TWENTY SEVEN NINETY THANK YOU PROTECT. THANK YOU RT WITNESSES IN SUPPORT IN THE ROOM NAME AND ORGANIZATION. COME TO THE MIKE. HELLO I AM CAIT VENDOR TAG AND I'M A STAFF MEMBER AT FUTURES WITHOUT VIOLENCE HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND I SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU. HELLO MANY SALLY A STAFF MEMBER FUTURES WITHOUT VIOLENCE I'M IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THINK THANK YOU. I AM SHARING THE NON ANTI TRAFFICKING AT- ATTORNEY AND I SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK A KRAMER MATTER ON BEHALF OF ACLU CALIFORNIA ACTION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING GOING BACK AS FOR THE ELLA BAKER CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. SHARE AND CHER- JONES SAWYER THAT I HAVE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR SIGNATURES OF HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS IN SUPPORT. WELL- OUR HELP IN IN PROVIDERS- NOTABLY- JACQUELINE CAMPBELL WHO IS THE INTERNATIONAL CARE DID YOU HAVE A HARD WORK OKAY HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR THANK YOU. THE RECALL THE FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET IT INTO THE RECORD. ANYTHING ELSE OKAY ARE THERE IT ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IN. COULD YOU. CHOOSE LET THEM HAVE A SEAT PLEASE. YEAH. OKAY. HEY YOU HAVE THE SAME FIVE MINUTES YOU SPLIT IT UP ANYWAY YOU WANT TO MINUTES TO ADMINISTER PIECE OR WHICHEVER YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TODAY MY NAME IS JOYCE BLUE AND I'M IN OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL. AS A SURVIVOR OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE MYSELF WHO WENT TO THE HOSPITAL MANY TIMES THROUGHOUT A TEN YEAR MARRIAGE AS A RESULT OF BEING ABUSED I HAD WOULD HAVE WELCOMED HEALTHCARE PROVIDER MAKING REPORT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO ME I FEEL THAT IF THE REPORT HAD BEEN MADE THE VERY FIRST TIME. I WENT TO THE DOCTOR THAT MAYBE MY VIEWS OR WHAT HAVE AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN ARRESTED HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR HURTING ME IN FOR BREAKING THE LAW. I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT IF THE HEALTHCARE PROVIDER REPORTED TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. THE VERY FIRST TIME I WENT TO THE HOSPITAL WITH BROKEN BONES. AND INTERNAL INJURIES IT WOULD HAVE PREVENTED FURTHER ABUSED BY MY HUSBAND SUCH AS BEING STRANGLED SEVERAL TIMES ANTI BLACKED OUT BROKEN JAW. RIBS AND BEING ASSAULTED WHILE EIGHT MONTHS PREGNANT AND OTHER TYPES OF VICTIMIZATION WHICH EVENTUALLY LED. AFTER TEN YEARS OF REVIEWS LED TO MY VIEWS YOU'RE SHOOTING ME WITH AN M. SIXTEEN ASSAULT WEAPON WHICH HAD TWENTY ROUNDS AND IT. AND HE DID THIS IN FRONT OF OUR TWO SMALL CHILDREN THE ONLY REASON WELL I'M HERE TODAY IS BECAUSE THE GUN DOWN ON THE THIRD ROUND AFTER GOING THROUGH MY HAIR ON THE TOP OF MY HEAD. I FIRMLY BELIEVE IF IT WAS PORTED THE FIRST TIME I SOUGHT MEDICAL CARE MAYBE THE ABUSE WOULD HAVE BEEN FINALLY OVER FOR ME AND MY CHILDREN HAD SEVEN DURING TEN YEARS OF ABUSE. SINCE WORKING WITH SURVIVORS FOR FORTY YEARS NOW AS A PROFESSIONAL. I'VE NEVER ONCE ENCOUNTERED A VICTIM NOT WE NEED TO GET THE MEDICAL TREATMENT THEY NEED IT OUT OF FEAR IN. A REPORT BEING MADE TO LOG BACK FORSMAN HAVE FACT IT OFTEN TIME A VICTIM HAS BEEN TO THE DOCTOR AS A RESULT OF BEING ABUSED. LAW ENFORCEMENT OR CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES AND ADULT PROTECTIVE SAID SIR THIS HAS ALREADY BEEN INVOLVED IN THEIR LIVES ADDITIONALLY IT HAS BEEN MY EXPERIENCE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT TEND TO RESPOND QUICKER. WHEN REPORTED BY A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER THEN IF IT WAS REPORTED ON MY OWN AS A SURVIVOR AND PROFESSIONAL WHO HAS BEEN WORKING EVERY WITH SURVIVORS IN THEIR STORE DAY. IT IS MY EX THAT WHEN I HOW VAIDER SO THEY NEED TO REPORT. TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. THE REPORT EVEN IF I WANTED TO. I WAS SO PETRIFIED AND SCARED BUT I WANTED SOMEONE ELSE TO DO WHAT I COULD NOT DO. I PREFER SOMEONE ELSE DOING IT BESIDES ME BECAUSE IT WAS BAD ENOUGH KNOWING. THAT I WAS GOING TO GET BEAT UP AGAIN NO MATTER WHO IS INVOLVED WHETHER IT WAS HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. LAW ENFORCEMENT FAMILY MEMBER OR NEIGHBOR. AT LEAST THE BURDEN IS OFF OF ME. WHEN A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER REPORTS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. IT FEELS LIKE THEY CARE AND THAT THEY'RE ADVOCATING FOR MY SAFETY AND THE SAFETY OF. MY CHILDREN. IT ALSO SENDS THE MESSAGE THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS SERIOUS. AND IT'S A CRIME. MOST VICTIMS TEND TO MINIMIZE THE ABUSE. I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THE RELATIONSHIP THEY JUST WANT THE ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR TO STOP. MY HELP BY HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS REPORTING IT MIGHT BE THE THING THAT SAVES THAT VICTIM'S LIFE. SOMEONE UP MAKING THAT REPORT VERSUS THE VICTIM. IT REALLY IS MORE THAN ABOUT REPORTING IT IS ALSO ABOUT GETTING SURVIVORS CONNECTED TO RESOURCES CREATED A SAFETY PLAN FOR VICTIMS AND THEIR CHILDREN. AND SEEING WHAT CAN BE DONE. THERE'S ACCOUNTABLE FOR HURTING SOMEONE AND FOR NOT AND WE'RE BREAKING THE LAW BY REPORTING AND PROSECUTING. IN CONCLUSION JUST IMAGINE IF YOUR SISTER. YOUR DAUGHTER YOUR MOTHER YOUR GRANDMOTHER. ENTERED THEIR MERGER ROOM BECAUSE SHE WAS BEAT UP SHE WAS STABBED. AND STRANGLED AND LEFT FOR DEAD YOU WOULD WANT SOMEONE TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR HURTING THEM. AND FOR BREAKING THE LAW. MAYBE IF MORE PEOPLE REPORTED VERSUS NO ONE REPORTED THEN MAYBE THERE WOULD BE LESS VIOLENCE. YOU ALL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW TODAY AND THIS ROOM TO SAVE LIVES AND PREVENT FURTHER VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND CHILDREN. AND ISN'T THAT WHAT WE ALL WANT TO DO. I ASK THAT YOU PLEASE DO NOT SUPPORT THIS BILL. AT THE LEAST PUT IT ON HOLD UNTIL THERE CAN BE MORE DISCUSSION. THAT INCLUDES SURVIVORS AND WITH FACTUAL INFORMATION I REMEMBER THIS. AS YOU MAKE YOUR DECISION ON THIS DANGEROUS BILL. IF NO ONE REPORTS THEN THERE IS NO ONE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND YUR LOVE ONE MIGHT BE THE NEXT TO GET SHOT OUT WITH AN M. SIXTEEN. AND THAT GUY JUST MIGHT NOT JAM THANK YOU. THIRTY SECONDS I'LL GIVE YOU A MINUTE HEY GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS DOCTOR DUGAN I'M ACTUALLY THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR OVER THE STATEWIDE TRAINING- THE CONDUCT THESE TYPES OF.

THAT OVERTURNING THIS BILL WOULD LEAD TO INCREASE PATIENT SAFETY AND ESCAPE FROM TV I WOULD BE IN FULL SUPPORT.

AND SIDE THAT'S WHY I'M OPPOSED TO THIS BILL THE OTHER CONCERN I HAVE IS WHAT ABOUT THE SURVIVORS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. THEY PRESENT TO THE E. OURS WITH NEARLY THE SAME IDENTICAL INJURIES YET NO ONE HAS TALKED ABOUT HOW THIS WILL IMPACT TRAFFICKING SURVIVORS. SO MYOPINION. I RECOMMEND THAT WE MOVED TO YOUR BILL.

AB TWENTY SIX I'M A TWENTY THREE SIXTY ONE MIA BONTA JUVENILE TRANSFERRED TO COURT OF CRIMINAL JURISDICTION. GOOD MORNING YOU READ. GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR HELP WITH THE AMENDMENTS IN THE PAST DECADE CALIFORNIA HAS ENACTED LEGISLATION MEANT TO REDUCE THE TRANSFER OF JUVENILES TO ADULT COURT. AND PROVIDE JUVENILES OPPORTUNITY TO REHABILITATE UNFORTUNATELY YOUTH OF COLOR CONTINUE TO DISPROPORTIONATELY THE VICTIMS OF STRUCTURAL RACISM AND THE CUTS IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN 202096% OF JUVENILE TRANSFERS TO ADULT COURT. WHERE YOUTH OF COLOR MORE SPECIFICALLY 71% WERE HISPANIC AND TWENTY PERCENT WERE BLACK THIS IS IN PART DUE TO THE LACK OF GUIDANCE PROVIDED TO JUDGES MAKING THIS CRITICAL DECISION REGARDING JUVENILE TRANSFERS CURRENTLY JUDGES ARE REQUIRED TO WEIGH FIVE CRITERIA BEFORE DECIDING IF YOU SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO ADULT COURT. AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY ONE IT WOULD STRENGTHEN THE FIVE CRITERIA ANALYSIS BY REQUIRING A JUDGE TO MAKE AN AFFIRMATIVE FINDING THAT A JUVENILE IS NOT AMENABLE TO REHABILITATION IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. BEFORE MAKING A MOTION TO TRANSFER THAT JUVENILE TO ADULT COURT THAT FINDING WILL HAVE TO BE SUPPORTED BY CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE AND INCLUDE THE REASON SUPPORTING THE COURT'S FINDING THAT THE MINOR IS NOT AMENABLE TO REHABILITATION WELL UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE JUVENILE COURT. THANK YOU AND I'VE WITNESSES HERE WITH ME TODAY I HAVE JOHNSON LABEL WITH THE PACIFIC JUVENILE DEFENDER SYSTEM A CO SPONSOR TO THE BILL AND CANCER MENDOZA WITH THE ENTIRE RECIDIVISM COALITION. THANK YOU. FIVE MINUTES. THANK YOU UGH GOOD MORNING SO THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAS CALLED THE DECISION TO TRANSFER YOU FROM JUVENILE COURT TO ADULT COURT. THE WORST PUNISHMENT BUT THE JUVENILE SYSTEM IS EMPOWERED TO INFLICT. A YOUTH WHO WAS TRANSFERRED TO ADULT COURT FACES EXACTLY THE SAME PUNISHMENT AS AN ADULT- COMMITTED THE SAME CRIME UP TO LIFE IN PRISON. A YOUTH WHO WAS TRANSFERRED WILL BE INCARCERATED IN THE SYSTEM THAT FOCUSES ON PUNISHMENT AND NOT REHABILITATION. AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY ONE IS A MODEST CHANGE TO CODIFY A PRINCIPLE THAT MAY ALREADY SEEM OBVIOUS IF A JUVENILE COURT JUDGE FINDS THE TO USE IS AMENABLE TO REHABILITATION. THE YOUTH SHOULD STAY IN JUVENILE COURT. CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT STATED OVER FIFTY YEARS AGO THAT THE CRITICAL QUESTION AT A TRANSFER HEARING IS THE MINERS AND MEAN ABILITY TO TREATMENT IN JUVENILE COURT. BUT OUR CURRENT STATUTES DO NOT CLEARLY REFLECT THAT PRINCIPLE. INSTEAD THE CURRENT LAW PROVIDES NO GUIDANCE TO JUDGES ABOUT HOW THEY SHOULD WEIGH THE FIVE FACTORS THAT ARE CONSIDERED IN THE TRUCK IN THIS TRANSFER DECISION. THIS IS LED TO SIGNIFICANT DISPARITIES IN JUDICIAL DECISION MAKING AND IT'S CONTRIBUTED TO THE PROFOUND RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES AMONG YOUTH WERE TRANSFERRED TO ADULT COURT. IT ALSO RESULTS IN YOU BEING TRANSFERRED TO ADULT COURT EVEN IF THE JUVENILE JUDGE CONCLUDES AFTER HEARING WITH PRESENTATION OF EVIDENCE BY BOTH PROSECUTION AND DEFENSE THAT THE YOUTH IS AMENABLE TO REHABILITATION IN JUVENILE COURT ENSURE THAT YOU TWO ARE AMENABLE TO REHABILITATION WILL REMAIN IN JUVENILE COURT. WITHOUT RESTRICTING IN ANY WAY A JUDGE'S ABILITY TO TRANSFER A YOUTH WHO IS NOT AMENABLE TO REHABILITATION. I WANT TO EXPRESS APPRECIATION TO COMMITTEE COUNCIL AND TO THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL FOR SUGGESTING AMENDMENTS THAT WERE ADOPTED LAST WEEK TO CLARIFY THE STANDARD FOR THIS JUDICIAL DECISION. WE HOPE THESE COMMONSENSE PRINCIPLES EARNED THE SUPPORT OF THE COMMITTEE AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME IS KEN MENDOZA I AM INTO ACTIVISTS AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZER WITH THE HEBER BURNS INSTITUTE AND ANTI RECIDIVISM COALITION THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY. WHEN I WAS JUST FOURTEEN YEARS OF AGE I SPENT MY FIRST NAME DEVON HALL WHEN I WAS SEVENTEEN YEARS OF AGE I WAS IN FRONT OF A JUDGE WHO HAD TO DECIDE WHETHER I WOULD BE SENT TO ADULT COURT TO SERVE EIGHT TWENTY FIVE TO LIFE. PRISON SENTENCE OR WHETHER I WILL BE ALLOWED TO REMAIN IN JUVENILE COURT. HOW TO HAD A DIFFERENT JUDGE SUCH AS ONE WHO BELIEVE THAT OUR KIDS WHO COMMIT SERIOUS OFFENSES SHOULD BE SENT TO ADULT COURT. I WILL BE IN PRISON RIGHT NOW AND WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BE RELEASED ON TO TWENTY THIRTY. OF THAT WOULD BE A WASTE OF POTENTIAL. MMHM FOR SORRY BUT THE I'M I'M I'M IN MY SPEECH- WHEN I WAS THE HOW TO HOW TO YOU SO- IS THE OF THE G. THAT I WAS IN FRONT OF THE SITE THAT TO GIVE ME A CHANCE AND I WAS ABLE TO TAKE A BUNCH OF THE COUNSELING MENTORSHIP AND EDUCATION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF. YOUR DEPARTMENT JUST WANTED JUSTICE HAD TO OFFER I WAS ABLE TO EARN AN EARLY RELEASE IN A FEW IN FEW YEARS SINCE THEN I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DEDICATE MY LIFE IN MENTORING OTHERS TO KEEP THEM OUT OF THE SYSTEM I HAVE DONE EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT WITH THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. AS A MEMBER OF AN STAFF WITH THE ANTI RECIDIVISM COALITION I WORKED ON MORE THAN TWENTY LEGISATIVE BILLS- AND MANY COUNTY INITIATIVES WHICH HAVE POSITIVELY IMPACTED MANY LIVES IN RETURN I IN TURN MAKING OUR COMMUNITY SAFER I'M SORRY IT'S HARD TO HEAR- DO I HAVE NOT BE POSSIBLE IF THE COURTS WILL HAVE NOT THEM INTO PRISON. NOT THAT I AM A TWENTY OR TWENTY EIGHT YEAR OLD GUY I RECOGNIZE THAT AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN I WAS JUST A KID A TEENAGER IMPACTED BY THE SEVERE TRAUMA THAT I HAD AS A KID I AM GLAD THAT THE JUDGE DIDN'T JUST THROW AWAY MY LIFE I THINK MY LIFE DIDN'T MATTER. MANY OF MY FRIENDS WERE NOT SO LUCKY FOR EXAMPLE MY FRIEND NELSON AROUND I'M IN THEM IS MORE ON A TELEPHONE RECEIVE A PRISON SENTENCE AND WAS JUST REALLY SAID URKEL OR MICHEAL ROMERO WHO I MET IN JUVENILE HALL AND HAD RECENTLY. HAD BORN DAUGHTER WHO RECEIVE A THIRTY YEAR TO LIFE SENTENCE HE HAS FINALLY RECONNECTED WITH DAUGHTER WHO'S NOT A TEENAGER THEY HAD JUDGES WHO TRANSFERRED IN HOW TO ADULT COURT WHERE THEY RECEIVE LENGTHY SENTENCES THEY WERE KIDS JUST LIKE ME. ARE THEY DO THEY WERE ABLE TO REMAIN IN JUVENILE COURT COULD RECEIVE ABILITY OF SERVICES AND NOW OUR FUTURE LEADERS LIKE MY MEDICINE THERE'S A MEMBERS IS STICKING TO SHAUNA WHO WAS RELEASED AT THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN AND FROM THE TODAY AND IS NOW A TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD COMMISSION ABOUT THE L. A. COUNTY OR MILDER MEANT TEAM- Q. ONE THE CAME INTO WAS RELEASED FROM THE A DAY. AND IS IN KAPALI POINT IN PERSON LAW DEGREE. I THINK IT IS BUT- PASS THIS BILL SO THAT. CAN BE REHABILITATED. IN THE JUVENILE. SYSTEM IN NOT FROM TO ADORE PRISON. TO BE. FOR DEBT. VICTIM AT RISK OF SOURCE. AND CON TO SERVE WITHOUT A- SERVICE AND- THAT COULD HAVE HELPED. BECOME THE- VERSIONS OF THEM. LET'S KEEP THE ROAD TO. THE OPEN. AND I.AND YES ON A BETWEEN THREE SIX ONE AND I. FOR SAID IN A LOT. IT IS A HUNDRED HE DID A GREAT MR MENDOZA. SO AN- HERE IN SUPPORT. AND WITH A THE ROOM.

A TO US TO THIS POINT BUT TODAY I'M PRESENTING AB TWENTY SIX FORTY FOUR THE BILL THAT PROHIBITS LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS FROM USING THREATS PHYSICAL HARM OR PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIPULATION INTERROGATION TACTICS WHEN QUESTION OF YOUTH TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE OR YOUNGER. MEMBERS FOR NEARLY A YEAR MY OFFICE IS WORKING LAW ENFORCEMENT POST PUBLIC DEFENDERS VARIOUS NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION SPECIALIZING IN JUVENILE JUSTICE. AND PUBLIC SAFETY CONSULTANTS HERE IN THE ASSEMBLY AS WELL AS THE SENATE. TO PUT FOR THOUGHTFUL LEGISLATION SURROUNDING JUVENILE INTERROGATIONS. AS I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE THERE CONTINUES TO BE A GROWING BODY OF RESEARCH THAT SUGGESTS THAT ONE FALSE CONFESSIONS OR ONE OF THE LEADING CAUSES OF WRONGFUL CONVICTIONS AND TO THE BRAIN IS NOT FULLY DEVELOPED UNTIL THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE. WELL CURRENT LAW REQUIRES THAT YOU SEVENTEEN YEARS OF AGE OR YOUNGER TO CONSULT WITH LEGAL COUNSEL EXISTING LAW FAILS TO RECOGNIZE THAT EVEN AN INFORMAL WAIVER OF RIGHTS DOES NOT PROTECT YOU FROM FALSELY IMPLICATING THEMSELVES OR OTHERS AND SERIOUS CRIMES WHEN AN INTERROGATION INVOLVES COERCIVE MANIPULATIVE AND GIL PRASOON LAW ENFORCEMENT. TECHNIQUES IN ADDITION. TO PROHIBITING THE USE OF AFTER MENTION TACTICS AB TWENTY SIX FORTY FOUR RECOGNIZES THAT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THESE LIMITATIONS SHOULD NOT APPLY PARTICULARLY WHEN IT IS NECESSARY. TO PROTECT LIFE OR PROPERTY FROM IMMINENT HARM. FINALLY IN WORKING WITH THE COALITION OF LOS ANGELES AND SANTA CLARA COUNTY PROBATION UNIONS. I HAVE EXTENDED THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT PROBATION OFFICERS NEED TO NOTIFY THE PUBLIC DEFENDER WHEN A MINOR IS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY AT A JUVENILE HALL OR ANY OTHER PLACE OF CONFINEMENT. IN CLOSING MEMBERS I KNOW THAT THERE HAS BEEN SOME CONCERN REGARDING THE CLASSIFICATION OF A TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD AS A JUVENILE. HOWEVER I JUST WANT TO REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED AB THIRTEEN OH EIGHT STONE. WHICH NOW REQUIRES THE BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS TO CONDUCT YOUTH OFFENDER PAROLE HEARINGS. FOR OFFENDERS THAT WERE TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE OR YOUNGER AT THE TIME OF THE OFFENSE. THAT BILL RECOGNIZE THAT THE BRAIN IS NOT FULLY DEVELOPED AT THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE. THIS BILL RECOGNIZES THE SAME ASSESSMENT AND THEREFORE THESE INDIVIDUALS SHOULD BE SHIELDED FROM IMPROPER INTERROGATION METHODS AS WELL. WITH ME TO TESTIFY TODAY BUT TO ROLES WITH WILL WE ALSO HAVE. NOTABLE WILLIE PELOTA- DRILLS WITH WHO WAS WRONGLY WRONGFULLY CONVICTED IN ILLINOIS' AS A YOUTH AND NOW LIVES IN CALIFORNIA AND WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN PASSING ILLINOIS' ANTI DECEPTION LAW.

GOOD MORNING MISTER TURNER MEMBERS. COURCELLES ALONE WE HAVE A CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION RESPECTFULLY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL FIRST PEACE OFFICER CANDIDATES AND PERSONS SERVING AS PEACE OFFICERS ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE INITIAL AND CONTINUING EDUCATION ABOUT AND TRAINING ABOUT MYRIAD TOPICS RELATED TO THE LIVERY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT SERVICES. THE STANDARDS ARE OVERSEEN BY POST COMMISSION ON PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING AND INSTEAD OF RELYING ON POST STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES DEVELOPED BY EXPERTS AND STAKEHOLDERS BASED ON BEST PRACTICE THIS BILL IMPOSES RIGID LEGISLATIVE MANDATES FROM ONE PERSPECTIVE AS TO HOW INTERROGATIONS OF PERSONS AGED TWENTY FIVE YEARS OR YOUNGER SHOULD BE CONDUCTED. CERTAINLY WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE SITUATIONS THAT PRESCRIBED BY THE PROPONENT BUT I'M TRYING TO AVOID THOSE THE BILL GOES TOO FAR- MANY OF THE DEFINITIONS IN THE BILL ARE UNCLEAR. AMBIGUOUS AND OTHERS WILL PREVENT REASONABLE METHODS OF INVESTIGATION. DOES QUOTE UNQUOTE MAKING ACCUSATIONS INCLUDE STATEMENTS RELATING FACTS THAT ARE KNOWN TO BE TRUE AND ARE NOT IN DISPUTE. CITING EVIDENCE WOULD BE PRECLUDED IF IT WERE DETERMINED THAT DOING SO WAS QUOTE WOULD DEMONSTRATE THE HOUSTON ALSO BE FUEL. IT'LL BE DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHAT'S ALLOWABLE UNDER THIS BILL AND AS A RESULT IT'S LIKELY IMPORTANT INFORMATIONAL GO UNDISCOVERED OR BE WITHHELD. IN VETOING SENATE BILL FOUR NINETY FOUR LAST YEAR THE GOVERNOR DIRECTED POST TO DEVELOP TRAINING ON INTERPERSONAL COMMUNICATION SKILLS. AND ETHICAL SCIENCE BASED INTERVIEWING SO FOR THAT REASON AND THOSE PREVIOUSLY STATED WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION THERE WERE VOTER PHONE LINES EIGHTEEN T. OPERATOR ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. WE'LL GO TO LINE TWENTY EIGHT. THANK YOU CAN STONE STONE ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. HELLO FOR THE LINES INTO MR CARE. THANK YOU NOW BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MR BLACKETT. YEAH I THINK THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS VERY NOBLE AND I ADMIRE YOUNG MAN. WHO CAME FORWARD AND I'M VERY VERY SORRY THAT YOU HAD TO PAY- A PRICE FOR SOMETHING YOU DIDN'T DO. THAT'S COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE AND- IT SHOULD BE REPUDIATED IN EVERY WAY HOWEVER I ALSO THINK THAT. HAVING THEN IN THE CAPACITY OF THESE INTERROGATION CIRCUMSTANCES I WILL TELL YOU THAT- IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT MANY OF. THE OFFENDERS THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT INTERVIEW ARE VERY AFRAID AND HAVE NO TRUST. A LAW ENFORCEMENT AND SO SOME OF THE TACTICS THAT ARE USED TO GET PEOPLE TO NOT BE AFRAID. OF FALL UNDER QUESTION AND I'D- I DO THINK THAT IT IS IMPROPER. PERSONALLY TO USE DECEPTION TO TRY TO GET PEOPLE EVEN TO ADMIT TO TRUTH BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT I DON'T THINK THE ENDS JUSTIFIES THE MEANS- IN MANY CIRCUMSTANCES BUT I DO THINK THAT THIS BILL UNFORTUNATELY GOES TOO FAR. AND MAKE SOME GENERALIZATIONS THAT I THINK ARE UNREASONABLE TO THINK THAT. ALL PEOPLE DON'T HAVE A DAHLE JUDGEMENTAL THERE TWENTY SIX IS TOO. UNREASONABLE I DON'T THINK THAT'S A REASONABLE JUDGMENT I KNOW THAT THERE'S SOME STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT THERE'S SOME DEVELOPMENTAL. CIRCUMSTANCES THAT AREN'T REACHED UNTIL THAT AGE HOWEVER I DO THINK THAT THE BROAD POLICY OF NOT- RECOGNIZING PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO USE ADULT JUDGE UNTIL THEY'RE TWENTY SIX IS UNREASONABLE- AND THAT'S JUST OF. OPINION ON OF MINE BASED ON EXPERIENCE. AND- RIGHT I THINK THAT THERE ARE MANY MANY COMMENDABLE PARTS OF THIS BILL THAT- ARE. VERY SUPPORTABLE AND I DO THINK THERE'S WORK TO BE DONE. ON TO MAKE SURE THAT- WE DON'T HAVE OUTCOMES LIKE THIS POOR GENTLEMAN THAT CAME TO TESTIFY TODAY BUT THIS BILL IS NOT THE VEHICLE THAT- ADDRESSES THE PROBLEMS APPROPRIATELY SO I WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT UNFORTUNATELY BUT I WANT TO EXPLAIN WHY. RESPOND TO. I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY I GREW UP IN NEW YORK CITY GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE. WHEN THE CENTRAL PARK FIVE WERE TAKEN FROM US THEIR YOUTH WAS TAKEN FROM US. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY TO SHARE THE WAYS IN WHICH OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. TOOK YOUR YOUTH AND YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY BE. A YOUNG PERSON THERE IS A PREPONDERANCE OF RESEARCH AND EVIDENCE THAT DEMONSTRATES THAT THE ADOLESCENT MINE IS ACTUALLY STILL DEVELOPING UNTIL THEY'RE TWENTY FIVE I ALSO HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH MANY ADOLESCENTS. HAVE BEEN QUESTIONED BY POLICE AND SEE THE POWER DYNAMIC THAT HAPPENS- IN THOSE IN THOSE SITUATIONS AND I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING FORWARD. THIS LEGISLATION LET LEGISLATION WHICH WILL ALLOW THAT INTERROGATION ROOM TO ACTUALLY BE A PLACE WHERE. YOU CAN BE PROTECTED AND HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE JUSTICE- IN THOSE MOMENTS AS THEY ARE DEALING WITH THAT AT A POWER DYNAMIC- AND A SITUATIONAL DYNAMIC IN TERMS OF THEIR OWN DEVELOPMENTS THAT CAN BE LEVELED SO FOR THOSE REASONS I WILL BE. SUPPORTING THIS LEGISLATION. YEAH COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY SURE YOU MAY CLOSE. AUTHORS THANK YOU- I THINK THAT THE TESTIMONY- PRETTY MUCH LAYS THE PREDICATE FOR WHY IT'S NECESSARY TO LOOK AT THIS ISSUE AND TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS SCIENCE THIS IS A SO OFTEN THAT I I'VE BEEN COMMITTED INCIDENT HEARD PRESENTATIONS ON BILLS IT SAID WELL YOU KNOW THAT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I YOU JUST HAD SOME DATA. TO SUPPORT WHY WE NEED TO DO X. Y. AND Z. I DON'T THINK THAT AS- NUMBER BONTA HAS OUTLINED THERE'S BEEN A BILL QUITE LIKE THIS IN TERMS OF DATA THAT SUPPORTS SCIENTIFICALLY. V. THE DEVELOPMENTAL STATUS OF A YOUNG PERSON'S BRAIN AND NOT JUST THE BRAIN WHICH IS HOW THEY INTERACT IN SOCIETY AND HOW THEIR MOTIONAL. DYNAMICS ARE STILL COMING TOGETHER AND I THINK THAT THAT. WE ALSO GONNA TRY ON ALL THESE BILLS I TRY VERY HARD TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR HOW. OF MUCH OF VALUE WORKING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND HOW I WORK WITH THEM EARLY. AND AS WAS PRESENTED OF THE PROVISION OFFICERS RECOGNIZE THAT BUT THEY WERE THE ONLY ONES THAT WE WERE WORKING WITH WORK WITH ALL OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TO TAKE INPUT EARLY IN THIS BILL. AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE REFLECTING SOME OF THE REAL CONCERNS THAT THEY WERE DESCRIBING. AND AS IT RELATES TO POST- TRAINING IS ONGOING. AND WE WORK WITH POST ON THIS BILL. SO THAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE DYNAMICS OF HOW- WITH THE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH WITH THE BILL AND WHY IT'S IMPORTANT THAT- THE TRAINING CONTINUE TO REFLECT THE NEW INFORMATION NEW SCIENCE A NEW DIRECTION THAT WE THINK WE NEED TO ADDRESS AND EMBRACE. IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AND WHEN THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN AN ENVIRONMENT- LIKE THIS THAT THEY ARE. PROTECTED AND THAT- THEY'RE NOT PUT IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY- CAN SAY SOMETHING OR DO SOMETHING THAT. WHAT HUNDRED OF A CRIME TO THE DO. SO WELL OUR- ASK RIVAL. THE MOTION MOTION WITH THE BILL. SECOND YOU HAVE A MOTION IS SECOND CALL FROM QUEST MEMBER HOLDEN THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED AS AMENDED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. LACKEY LACKEY NO BONTA. BONTA HI BRIAN BRIAN I WORK. SANTIAGO SEYARTO. THE MEASURES LOCAL. THANK WITH WITH. OKAY IN THE ROLE YOU MAY CONTINUE WITH AB- TWO SEVEN SEVEN THREE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS- AGAIN I'D LIKE TO- LET THE COMMITTEE KNOW THAT I'M ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THEIR AMENDMENTS THAT I LIKE TO THINK THAT YOU'RE IN THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND CONSULTANT FOR WORKING WITH MY STAFF AND SUPPORTERS TO ADDRESS. SOME OF THE CHAIRS CONCERNS A TODAY I'M PRESENTED AB TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY THREE THE BILL THEY WERE REQUIRE PEACE OFFICER MAKING A TRAFFIC OR PEDESTRIANS STOP TO STATE THE REASON FOR THE STOP BEFORE ASKING ANY QUESTIONS UNLESS THE OFFICER REASONABLY BELIEVES. THAT WITHHOLDING THE REASON FOR THE STOP IS NECESSARY TO PROTECT LIFE OR PROPERTY OR A THREAT. MEMBERS FOR NEARLY A YEAR MY OFFICE AGAIN HAS WORKED WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT POST VARIOUS NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AND PUBLIC SAFETY CONSULTANTS HERE IN THE SIMPLY AS WELL AS THE SENATE. TO PUT FOR THOUGHTFUL LEGISLATION SURROUNDING TRAFFIC AND- PEDESTRIAN STOPS OVER THE PAST YEAR THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS IN DEPTH REPORTS SURROUNDING TRAFFIC STOPS TO INCLUDE INVESTIGATIONS FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES. THE LA TIMES. IN A REPORT FROM THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE. THE COMMON THEME SURROUNDING THESE REPORTS IS THAT PEOPLE OF COLOR MORE SO FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE STOPPED THAN WHITE INDIVIDUALS. WHAT IS MORE TROUBLING IS THAT ACCORDING TO THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE STOPS OF AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO INVOLVE A WEAPON THEN STOPS THE WHITE INDIVIDUALS. WITH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL. POST IN AB AB TWO SEVENTY THREE REQUIRES LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TO DOCUMENT THE REASON FOR THE STOP ON ANY CITATION OR POLICE REPORT RESULTING FROM THE STOP. IN TERMS OF EDUCATING THE PUBLIC THIS BILL REQUIRES THE DMV TO INCLUDE INFORMATION REGARDING THE DUTY TO OF A PEACE OFFICER TO STATE THE REASON FOR THE STOP IN THE DMV HANDBOOK AT THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY. AS YOU MAY RECALL THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED AND GOVERNOR ROWN SIGNED MY BILL AB TWENTY NINE EIGHTEEN IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WHICH NOW REQUIRES A DMV TO INCLUDE INFORMATION REGARDING PERSONS CIVIL RIGHTS DURING A STOP. INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO FILE A COMPLAINT AGAINST THE PEACE OFFICER. FINALLY THIS BILL MAKES FAILURE TO STATE THE REASON FOR THE STOP PROJECT GROUNDS FOR STATUTORY MOTION TO SUPPRESS. I AM AWARE THAT THIS PARTICULAR PROVISION OF THE BILL IS CAUSING SOME CONCERN. FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PLEDGED TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM AS WELL AS THIS COMMITTEE CONSULTANT. TO SEE IF WE CAN FIND AN ALTERNATIVE WAY TO HOLD LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR FAILURE TO DISCLOSE THE REASON FOR THE STOP. IN CLOSING MEMBERS LIKE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS- TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THIS TROUBLING PROBLEM. AS I MENTIONED BEFORE I BELIEVE THAT THE CONFRONTATION BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT THE PUBLIC BEGINS BECAUSE PEOPLE OF COLOR BEING ASKED TO SURRENDER THEIR CIVIL RIGHTS AND DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY THEY WERE BEING STOPPED. BUT THEY ARE FORCED TO COMPLY. SURELY THIS BODY CAN FIND A SOLUTION TO THIS DILEMMA. THIS BILL IS MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. WITH ME TO TESTIFY TODAY KAITLIN DEAN HEY C. O. U. CALIFORNIA ACTION LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE. AND CHRIS LAWSON ADVOCATE COALITION FOR JUST AND EQUITABLE CALIFORNIA I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. AT&amp;T OPERATOR IF WE COULD- HELLO- KALING DEAN FROM ACLU.

STAND BLAND PHILANDO. WHAT STOCK DANTE RIGHT AND GRAY SHORT BOOK FOR ALL BLACK AND STILL THEM DURING ORDINARY STOPS THE VIOLATION THAT DO NOT PLAY PUBLIC SAFETY. IT IS WONDER THAT PEOPLE CAN MURDER AT AND SHEER AFTER BEING STOCK BY AN ALL. WHO CAN THEM OF THE ON THE. I WOULD POLICE OFFICER TO STATE THE REASON FOR TRAFFIC CONTEST STOP AT THE TIME OF THE STOCK BEFORE ASKING ANY. COULD LITERALLY SAVE LIVES IF BILL IS BECAUSE SENSE AND ONE OF ITS FRANKLY LAW OVERDUE. I RESPECTFULLY YOU TO EIGHTY SEVEN SEVEN THREE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OKAY WE'RE READY TO LISTEN TO- CHRIS. LUNCHEON TWENTY CAN YOU HEAR. YES YOU MAY. YOU OPEN THE DOOR NOW YOU'RE GOING TO GET WILL BE SHOT. I'M GOING TO SHOOT YOU WERE PART OF THAT DON'T YOU WANT. I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU WHY I PULLED YOU OVER. ALL YOU OVER BECAUSE I CAN'T. GOOD MORNING ASSEMBLYMEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE CHANCE TO SPEAK IT URGES SUPPORT FOR A BI TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY THREE MY NAME IS CHRIS WATSON WITH THE COALITION FOR JUST AND EQUITABLE CALIFORNIA. THE STATEMENT I THOUGHT OF MY TESTIMONY WITH OUR STATE SPOKE ABOUT OF THE LAW IN OF DURING TRAFFIC STOP THE FIRST IT WAS SPOKEN SENATE VENUE AND WERE. THE SECOND THE MARVIN BIRD BEING THE J. HARTSFIELD AND ALLOW TWO WAS BOTH TO MEET TRAGICALLY THE VENUE MARVIN IN GENERAL ALL KILLED BY THOSE OFFICERS DURING STOPS I THINK MY CONDOLENCE TO THEIR FOR. AND MAY THEY REST IN PEACE ALL RIGHT BY THE BLESSING THE GRACE OF GOD I'M ALIVE TO DAY AS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN WITH A SENSE IMPORTANT INSULATE IN THIS COUNTRY I KNOW THAT AT ANY TIME I CAN BE STOPPED WHILE DRIVING QUESTION SIR I HAVE MY RIGHTS VIOLATED WITH LITTLE EFFECTIVE RECOURSE. IT WAS DONE TIME AND TIME AGAIN TO MY ANSWERS BEFORE THE END OF SLAVERY AND DURING JIM CROW AND I KNOW THAT IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE I'M BLACK IF BECAUSE OF WHAT BEING BLACK MEANS IN THIS COUNTRY. BEING BLACK MEANS YOU HAVE NO POWER AND NO RIGHT THAT CAN'T BE VIOLATED. NOT BECAUSE OF THE COLOROF MY SKIN ONLY BUT BECAUSE OF MY CONNECTION TO INSULATE ANCESTORS IN THIS COUNTRY IN SHORT NOT BECAUSE OF WHO I AM BUT BECAUSE OF WHAT COME FROM. OF COURSE THOSE OFFICER DIDN'T ASK IF I WAS THE DESIGN OF US NAVY BEFORE THEY STOP ME BUT DIDN'T HAVE TO BASED ON MY BACK AGAIN AND IT NEARLY MADE CONNECTION U. S. WITH. THAT'S WHAT WE ARE TOLD ME I STOPPED YOU BECAUSE I CAN LOOK. MARVIN AND J. WERE WERE FEATURED IN EVERY NEW YORK TIMES THANK ONE DAY TRAFFIC STOPS ACCORDING TO THE PROSECUTORS THESE CASE K. QUESTION WHETHER THE STOP WOULD HAVE ENDED THEIR IF BOXER HAD EXT TO THE- WHY WERE ORDERING THEM TO THE CAR IN THE FIRST PLACE AB TWENTY SEVEN SEVEN WOULD REQUIRE A PEACE OFFICER MAKING A TRAFFIC OR PEDESTRIAN STOP BEFORE ASKING ANY QUESTIONS THE STATE. THE REASON FOR THE STOP THE BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THE OF THE TO DOCUMENT THE REASON FOR THE STOP THIS IS COMMON SENSE AND GOOD FOR PUBLIC SAFETY MEMBERS. AB TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY THREE IS COMMONSENSE AND GO. FOR POP. SAFETY TO THE RIGHT. TO DATE. YES ONE AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTY. THANK THANK YOU. K. YOU HAVE ANY OTHER ON THE ROAD THAT WOULD LIKE TO EXT OUR SO FOR THIS. PLEASE GO FORWARD. MAR CHORE ON BEHALF OF THE K. PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. GREGORY PUT OUT WITH INITIATE JUSTICE IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOING BACK A CELL BAKER CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. OKAY DO WE HAVE- ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. YOU MAKE A FORWARD. YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN WRIST CORSAGE ALONG BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION AGAIN- RESPECTFULLY BUT REGRETTABLY IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL WHEN A PEACE OFFICER INITIATES A STOP THERE ARE MANY VARIABLES THAT MUST BE CONSIDERED AN INFORMATION THAT SHOULD BE GATHERED TRAFFIC STOP CAN BE AMONG THE MOST DANGEROUS TYPES OF INTERACTIONS THAT PEACE OFFICERS ENCOUNTER SOMETHING THE CHERNOW'S OR WELL. AND OFTEN MAKES SENSE FOR AN OFFICER TO SEEK AND OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF A CONTACT THIS CAN BE VITAL IN ASSESSING THE RISK EMANATING FROM THE STOP AND PEACE OFFICERS ARE TRAINED DETERMINING RISKS SURROUNDING THE TRAFFIC STOP IS A KEY CONSIDERATION. THE BILL'S LIMITATION IS SO STRICT IN FACT ASKING A PERSON'S IDENTIFICATION OR EVEN ASKING A PERSON TO TURN OFF THE VEHICLE'S IGNITION PRIOR TO DISCLOSING THE REASON FOR THE STOP. ANY QUESTION. OBTAINING MORE INFORMATION FROM THE SUBJECT THE STOP IS VITAL TO PROTECTING EVERYONE'S SAFETY. AND THE BILL'S EXCEPTION BASED ON A QUOTE UNQUOTE IMMINENT THREAT IS NOT ENOUGH TO ADDRESS ALL THESE SITUATIONS THAT ARE IMBUED WITH RISK. FURTHER THE BILL'S PROVISION THAT A FAILURE TO TELL THE PERSON THE REASON FOR THE STOP BEFORE ASKING FOR- ANY QUESTIONS IS GROUNDS FOR FILING A MOTION TO SUPPRESS AND COULD IT. COULD END UP ULTIMATELY KEEPING CRUCIAL INFORMATION FROM A JUDGE OR JURY. IF THERE'S CRIMINAL ACTIVITY DISCOVERED DURING THE STOP. THE CONFESSION TO A MURDER. GIVEN BY THE SUBJECT OF A TRAFFIC STOP AFTER THE PERSON HAS BEEN PROPERLY MORAN DIES. WOULD BE SUBJECT TO A MOTION TO SUPPRESS UNDER THIS BILL IF THE PEACE OFFICER STARTED TO STOP WITH THE QUESTION. ANY QUESTION. BEFORE STATE REASON FOR THE STOP REAL POSSIBILITY OF VAST MISCARRIAGES OF JUSTICE BASED ON THE SIMPLE TIMING OF AN OFFICER ASKING IF THEY MAY SEE THE PERSON'S IDENTIFICATION BEFORE TELLING THE PERSON WHY THEY WERE STOPPED. WITH THIS BILL APPEARS TO BE BASED ON THE NOTION THAT THE CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER IN WHICH THE INTERACTION DEVELOPS- WILL CHANGE THINGS BUT THERE'S NO GUARANTEE OF THAT. BUT THE GUARANTEE THAT DOES EXIST IS IF YOU ASK A PERSON AS AN OFFICER. TO TURN THE RADIO DOWN OR TO TURN OFF THE IGNITION OR TO ROLL DOWN A WINDOW. BEFORE SAYING I STOP YOU BECAUSE YOU HAVE A TAIL LIGHT OUT. THAN ANY EVIDENCE THAT'S DISCOVERED AFTER THAT FACT. IS SUBJECT TO A MOTION TO SUPPRESS AND MAY NOT ULTIMATELY BE ALLOWED IN COURT IF THERE'S OF PROCEEDING. AFTER THE FACT SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU KNOW VOTE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHERS IN THE ROOM TO ELECTRICS PRESSURE OPPOSITION. SAYING NINE OPERATOR CAN WE GO TO THE PHONE LINES AND ASK FOR ANYONE WHO HAS A SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION TO EXPRESS THAT OPINION. TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. WILL FIRST GO TO LINE NINETEEN. A GOOD MORNING REBECCA GONZALEZ OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS CALIFORNIA CHAPTER IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU THANK. NINE SIXTY NINE. OKAY YET THIS IS HENRY WITHOUT SIMILAR SACRAMENTO. THANK YOU. NINE TWENTY. HI YEAH HE COULD A RESIDENT WITH BROKEN PRIVACY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY THREE. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY SAYING NO FOR ENGAGEMENT YOU MAY CLOSER APPRECIATE AGAIN THE COMMITTEE WORKING WITH A SONG ON THIS BILL I DO ALSO APPRECIATE LAW ENFORCEMENT POST- CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL WHO WAS VERY INTEGRAL IN TERMS OF LAYING OUT THE STRUCTURE OF HOW WITH TECHNICAL INPUT- TO THE BILL SO WE WEREN'T FLYING SOLO- WE HAD- PARTICIPATION ALONG THE WAY AND CONTINUE TO REACH OUT AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE. CONVERSATIONS BUT I GUESS AS I THINK ABOUT WHAT WORKS IN THE REAL WORLD- I'M DRIVING A CAR AND I SEE THE LIGHTS AND I'M NEED TO PULL OVER THE FIRST QUESTION IN MY MIND IS WHY. WHY AM I BEING PULLED OVER THE OFFICER APPROACHES- HI I'M GOING TO NO I'M NOT STE THERE'S ALWAYS SOME MARGIN OF FOLKS OUT THERE WHO MAY DO SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT BUT- I'M A LET THE WINDOW DOWN. AND I'M EXPECTING THE OFFICER TO TELL ME WHY. I'VE BEEN PULLED OVER. THAT'S THE FIRST THING I'M LOOKING TO HEAR. AND SO I THINK THAT WHEN WE WENT AND I THINK THAT ON ALL OF THESE EFFORTS HERE'S DESIGNED TO CONTINUE TO BUILD TRUST BUILD. A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PUBLIC BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT IS SUSTAINING. IT SORT OF TURNS THE TIDE. I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU. THAT HIGHWAY PATROLS LIKE THE GOLD STANDARD. JUST IN TERMS OF HOW JUST MY INTERACTION WITH THEM IN RECENT TIMES. THAT THEY PRETTY MUCH NINETY SOME ODD PERCENT. ONCE THEY HAVE THAT INITIAL ENCOUNTER THEY GIVE A WARNING. AND THE PERSON DRIVES OFF. AND SO AS I'M HEARING THEIR STORY. I'M THINKING WELL OKAY IT WORKS IT CAN WORK FOR ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT WORKS FOR CHP. IT WORK FOR EVERYONE. WE RECOGNIZE A SAID IN MY STATEMENT THAT. THE LANGUAGE AROUND- EVIDENCE BEING SUPPRESSED WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT WITH NOWLEDGE THAT THERE MAY BE SOME AREAS THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON WERE PREPARED TO DO THAT- BUT I THINK IT'S A RIGHTEOUS BILL I THINK IT INCLUDES BECAUSE LAW ENFORCEMENT WAS WITH US. EARLY AT THE TABLE. THEIR FINGERPRINTS THEIR THOUGHTS THEIR IMPRESSIONS ARE ON THIS BILL. SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU MR HOLDEN AYE AND I WOULD JUST ADD REAL QUICKLY THAT- I WAS TRAINED THAT IS THE APPROPRIATE WAY TO ADDRESS THE PUBLIC AND- YOU MENTION AN AGENCY I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH THAT- THAT IS OUR STANDARD HOWEVER I DO BELIEVE THIS BILL UNFORTUNATE THIS POINT IS STILL TOO RIGID. AND I THINK IT HAS ASPECTS OF HER VERY VERY SUPPORTABLE MOST OF IT IS VERY SUPPORTABLE BUT I WISH THAT AND I HOPE THAT AS THIS MOVES FORWARD THAT THEY'LL BE SOME CONTINUAL- WORK THAT I'LL GET TO THE POINT WHERE I CAN SUPPORT OF AT THIS POINT I'M NOT THERE SO. WE HAVE A MOTION THE SECOND MOVED BACK. OKAY WILL CALL FOR THE- I AB TWENTY SEVEN SEVEN THREE BY SEPTEMBER HOLDEN THEM IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER LACKEY.

SO POINTS OF CLARIFICATION ON THIS BILL I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT. THAT WE DO CLARIFY WHAT THIS BILL DOES. AND SOME OF THE CONTEXT. THAT WE HAVE THIS BILLS DESIGNED TO PROTECT PEOPLE LIKE KELSEY. FROM PHYSICAL AND SEXUAL ABUSE. DURING A CRIMINAL PROSECUTION THE HEARSAY RULE. STATES THAT A STATEMENT WHICH WAS MADE OTHER THAN BY THE WITNESS WHILE TESTIFYING AT A HEARING IS INADMISSIBLE IN COURT IF THE VICTIM. AND ONLY THE VICTIM OF CHILD ABUSE IS UNDER TWELVE YEARS OF AGE THEY ARE EXEMPTS FROM. THE HEARSAY RULE. THIS BILL WOULD GRANT MINORS WITH AN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY WHO ARE THE VICTIM OF ABUSE UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN TO ALSO BE EXEMPT FROM HERE SEVERAL. DEFINITION OF ABUSE. AGAIN FOR THE SAKE OF CLARITY IN THE HEARSAY EXEMPTION RELATES TO CHILD ABUSE WHICH INCLUDES UNDER PENAL CODE ONE ONE ONE SIX FIVE POINT ONE. ONE PENETRATION HOWEVER SLIGHTLY OF THE VAGINAL OR OPENING OF ONE PERSON BY THE WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS THE EMISSION OF SEMEN TO SEXUAL CONTACT BETWEEN THE GENITALS OR IN A OPENING OF ONE PERSON IN THE MOUTH OR TONGUE OF ANOTHER. THREE INTRUSION BY ONE PERSON INTO THE GENITALS. OR IN A OPENING OF ANOTHER PERSON INCLUDING THE USE OF AN OBJECT FOR THIS PURPOSE EXCEPT THAT IT DOES NOT INCLUDE ACTS PERFORMED FOR A VALID MEDICAL PURPOSE FOR THE INTENTIONAL TOUCHING OF THEIR GENITALS. OR INTIMATE PARTS INCLUDING THE BREAST GENITALIA AREA. GROWING INNER THIGHS AND BUTTOCKS OR THE CLOTHING COVERING THEM OF A CHILD OR OF THE PERPETRATOR BY EACH CHILD FOR PURPOSES OF SEXUAL AROUSAL. OR GRATIFICATION. EXCEPT THAT IT DOES NOT INCLUDE ACTS WHICH MAY REASONABLY BE CONSTRUED TO BE NORMAL CARETAKER RESPONSIBILITIES INTERACTIONS WITH OR DEMONSTRATIONS OF AFFECTION FOR THE CHILD OR ACTS PERFORMED FOR A VALID MEDICAL PURPOSE. FIVE THE INTENTIONAL MASTURBATION OF THE PERPETRATORS D'ITALIA'S. IN THE PRESENCE OF A CHILD. MEMBERS I AM UNCOMFORTABLE EVEN READING THAT CODE. AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN EXPECT A CHILD WITH AN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY TO BE CROSS EXAMINED OVER SUCH HORRIFIC EVENTS. NOW LET'S LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE. AND DATA FROM A TWENTY TWENTY ONE REPORT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FOUND WERE VICTIMS OF 26% OF ALL NONFATAL VIOLENT CRIME WHILE COUNTING FOR ABOUT 12% OF THE POPULATION. THE RATE OF VIOLENT VICTIMIZATION AGAINST PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES FORTY SIX POINT TWO PER ONE THOUSAND AGE TWELVE OR OLDER WAS ALMOST FOUR TIMES THE RATE FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES TWELVE POINT THREE PER ONE THOUSAND. PERSONS WITH COGNITIVE DISABILITIES HAD THE HIGHEST RATE OF VIOLENT VICTIMIZATION. EIGHTY THREE POINT THREE PER ONE THOUSAND AMONG THE DISABILITY TYPES MEASURE. ONLY 9% OF RAPES OR SEXUAL ASSAULTS AGAINST PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES WERE REPORTED TO THE POLICE COMPARED 236% OF THOSE AGAINST PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE COMMITTEE CONCERNS. IN MY TEAM HAS BEEN WORKING. TRYING TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE WE'VE EVEN TAKEN COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE OPPOSED THAT WERE BROUGHT FORWARD BY ARCA TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS AND I'M ALWAYS HAPPY TO REFUND ANY CONCERNS OR AMENDMENTS MOVING FORWARD THE AMENDMENT THAT IS IN PRINT- WITH THE BILL THAT WE DID TAKE FROM OUR COACHES FOR THE RECORD- CHANGES. SECTION B. AND WHAT THE STATUS IS OVER TWELVE YEARS OF AGE AND THE COURT DETERMINES THE VICTIM HAS EIGHT INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY. MEMBERS WE HAVE GATHERED OVER. A HUNDRED LETTERS IN SUPPORT. FROM INDIVIDUALS FOR THIS MEASURE. THIS MEASURES RECEIVE SUPPORT FROM PORAC THE DA'S ARE CRIME VICTIMS UNITED AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY REGIONAL CENTER. IN CONCLUSION. THE EXEMPTION OF THE HEARSAY RULE GROUNDED BY AB TWENTY SEVENTEEN- KELSEY'S LAW. FOR THOSE WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES TO DEVELOPS UPON ESTABLISH PRE EXISTING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND GRANTS THE COURTS THE NECESSARY FLEXIBILITY TO PROTECT THE MOST VULNERABLE AT RISK MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY. THE CRIMINAL COURT PROCESS IS IN PLACE TO PROTECT THOSE IN NEED AND BY FAILING TO PASS AB TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE ARE FAILING THOSE VICTIMS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES AND SHOWING THEM THAT THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THOSE DISABILITIES AND GRANTING THE COURTS THE APPROPRIATE DISCRETION FROM AB TWENTY SEVENTEEN IS A CRUCIAL STEP TO ADDRESSING A SYSTEMATIC ISSUE AND STRENGTHENING CALIFORNIA'S COURT PROCEEDINGS. FOR THOSE WITH DISABILITIES AB TWENTY SEVENTEEN ALLOWS A MORE INCLUSIVE FAIR AND EQUITABLE APPROACH. FOR THOSE WITH DISABILITIES TO BE ADOPTED THE MEASURE ENSURES THAT THE PERPETRATORS OF ABUSE ARE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE IN THAT THOSE VICTIMS WITH DISABILITIES ARE NOT EXCLUDED OR OVERLOOKED. AS A FATHER WITH A SON WITH ELECTION BILL THESE. I KNOW FIRST HAND THE DIFFICULTIES THAT INTERVALS HAVE TO OVERCOME ON A DAILY BASIS THE DAILY STRUGGLES THAT THESE CHILDREN HAVE TO GO THROUGH. IN MEMBERS I URGE YOUR SUPPORT TODAY ON KELSEY'S LAW AB. TEN SEVENTEEN. ON THE OTHER HAND IT OVER TO MR GRAYSON AND THEN TO MISS WHEN YOU BAKER THE MOTHER OF KELSEY AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE ERICA GONZALES WITH THE DA ASSOCIATION ON THE LINE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND- TWO MEMBERS THANK YOU- FOR THE COMMITTEE FOR HEARING THIS BILL AND FOR STAFF FOR YOUR WORK ON IT. WHEN I HEARD ABOUT AB TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND WHAT IT DOES IT TAPPED INTO A PASSION OF MINE. AND IT WAS BECAME JUST A NATURAL RESPONSE ON MY PART TO WANT TO SUPPORT IT- TO THE EXTENT OF BECOMING A JOINT AUTHOR. THE REASON WHY IS BECAUSE THIS BILL EXPANDS THE EXCEPTION OF THE HEARSAY RULE FOR STATEMENTS THAT ARE MADE BY A CHILD. UNDER TWELVE YEARS OF AGE DESCRIBING CHILD ABUSE AND AS UNCOMFORTABLE AS THAT WAS TO HEAR THE LANGUAGE FROM THE CODE SECTION. THAT'S WHAT THEY WOULD BE EXPOSED TO TO ALSO INCLUDE. A PERSON WITH AN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN. WHEN INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES BECOME INVOLVED IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AS VICTIMS SUSPECTS DEPENDENCE. THEY DO FACE FEAR THEY FACE PREJUDICE THEY ALSO FACE A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING. IN FACT THESE INDIVIDUALS WITH IDT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY TO BE VICTIMIZED. AT LEAST TWO TIMES MORE LIKELY FOR VIOLENT CRIMES IN FOUR TO TEN TIMES FOR ABUSE AND OTHER CRIMES HOWEVER. THE ADVERSARIAL NATURE OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM MAKES MANY FOLKS LESS LIKELY TO SEEK JUSTICE. AT LEAST ON THEIR OWN BEHALF. PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL OR DEVELOPMENT DISABILITIES HAVE THE RIGHT TO JUSTICE THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO FAIR TREATMENT. TO ALL AREAS IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND MUST BE AFFORDED THE SUPPORTS. AND BUT ATIONS REQUIRED TO MAKE JUSTICE AND TO MAKE FAIR TREATMENT A REALITY FOR THEM IN THEIR LIFE. THIS IS A HUGE STEP FORWARD. IN ENHANCING FAIRNESS IT'S A HUGE STEP FORWARD IN PROTECTING PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES. AND BY ALLOWING PEOPLE WITH I. D. D. UNDER EIGHTEEN TO ALSO BE EXEMPT. FROM THE HEARSAY RULE WE CAN MEET THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. AND WE CAN ENSURE THAT ALL INDIVIDUALS HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. IF YOU ARE CLOSELY ENGAGED WITH THE IT D. COMMUNITY. THEN IT WOULD BE EASY FOR YOU TO CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR THIS BILL. HAVING GROWN UP IN A HOME. WITH A MEMBER OF THE IDT COMMUNITY HER NAME IS SHERRY. ONE OF THE SWEETEST MOST AWESOME PEOPLE I KNOW. MY SISTER. AT THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE AT THE AGE OF THIRTY HAVE THE MENTAL CAPACITY OF A TWELVE YEAR OLD. SHE HAS DOWN SYNDROME AND A MORE SEVERE WAY BUT SHE HAS BEEN ON THE FLOOR THIS BODY AND HAS MET SOME OF YOU. AND ADVOCATED FOR US SPECIAL OLYMPICS SHERRY WOULD NOT HAVE THAT MENTAL CAPACITY TO BE EXPOSED TO THAT KIND OF LANGUAGE. IN A COURT OF LAW AS TESTIFIED BY A COMMITTEE MEMBER IN THIS COMMITTEE. EVEN AT THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE COGNITIVE ABILITIES ARE STILL DEVELOPING. AND THAT'S WHAT WE WOULD CONSIDER FOR WHAT WE CALL IN SOCIETY A NORMAL PERSON HOW MUCH MORE IS IT LATER AND STRESSED FOR SOMEONE OF THE IDT COMMUNITY I PLEAD WITH  THE TIME COMES. THAT YOU. THE CHIU OF VOTING SO. IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL BUT REALLY THE TO VOTE IN SUPPORT OF MEMBERS OF THE IDT COMMUNITY. THAT NEED YOUR PROTECTION. COULD YOU GO PROCEED GOOD MORNING ASSEMBLYMEMBERS- MY NAME'S BAKER I'M HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SEVENTEEN KELSEY'S STARK. KELSEY. FOR SO LAST YEAR AND MORE. BUT HUNDRED CAME TO ME AND WE HER. EXIT LAW. CHIU UNDER THE CARE OF THE AND ONE QUICK TOUCH PROBE REPLETE. SHE'S TWENTY. AND BRICK DIDN'T HER MENTAL. TO COPE UP WITH THE DETAILS DID THE PLEA OFFICER IN OUR CAR INTERVIEW. NO WE SHE COULD T. V. THAT SHE COULD HAVE MADE IT. LIKE IF THERE'S NO WAY POSH AND THE DETECTIVES ME WHAT SHE SAID I THINK IT'S TO HEAR THE INTERVIEW BUT IF IT BEEN WOULD HAVE BEEN A TO BE USED IN THE COURT OF LAW LIKE IT DEFINITELY WOULD HAVE GOTTEN HER. FURTHER IF WE WOULD'VE HAD ENOUGH PHYSICAL EVIDENCE. BUT I DO THINK THAT BEING THAT SHE IS TWENTY FIVE AND MENTALLY SHE'S HM NEVER GROW PAST BEING THE EIGHT YEAR OLD AND SHE COLORS YOU COULD SPELL CAT AND DOG.  MEAN THAT'S ABOUT AS FAR AS SHE SHOULD UNDERSTAND MONEY SO FOR YOU GUYS IF YOU GUYS WOULD BE WILLING TO SUPPORT THIS I MEAN I JUST COULDN'T SEE PUTTING HER ON THE STAND EVEN IF I KNOW IT WON'T HELP OUR CASE AND I GET THAT. BUT IF I COULD CHANGE IT FOR OTHER PEOPLE AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH WHAT WE HAVE. WITH I MEAN TO GO TO HAPPY TRAILS IS LIKE A HORSE RIGHT. PAYER I MEAN ANYTHING TO HELP HER GET. THIS AND IS A MOM AND DO TO FIGURE OUT HOW I CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE I CAN'T HELP HER KEEP HER PROTECTED OR LIKE HOW GOING TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE I MEAN ALL THE EARS I WORKED ON THE AMBULANCE THAT'S WHAT I DID I HELP PEOPLE I DIDN'T KNOW SO THIS IS KIND OF ANOTHER BRANCH LIKE HOW CAN I HELP OTHERS AND KEEP THEM SAFE GIVE THEM SOME SORT OF LIKE JUSTIFICATION AND THE LEGAL SYSTEM. IT JUST I WOULD HOPE THAT YOU GUYS WOULD BOW I ON THIS AND JUST I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO SAY I HAD A WHOLE THING TYPED OUT AND I DIDN'T GO OFF OF ANY OF. BUT YOU BILL. EIGHTY OP WE A LOT MORE. ONE MORE WITNESS ERICA GONZALES. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU MY NAME IS ERICA GONZALEZ I AM A SUPERVISING DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY WITH THE TULARE COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SEVENTEEN THIS BILL MAKES AN IMPORTANT CHANGE TO ADMISSIBLE EVIDENCE IN COURT CURRENTLY STATEMENTS MADE BY VICTIMS UNDER TWELVE YEARS OF AGE WHEN DESCRIBING ANY ACT OR ATTEMPTED ACT OF CHILD ABUSE ARE ADMISSIBLE IN COURT HOWEVER THIS DOES NOT APPLY TO INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL OR DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES WHO MAY HAVE THE MENTAL CAPACITY. OF A CHILD UNDER TWELVE YEARS OF AGE THE CURRENT SYSTEM DOES NOT PROVIDE ADEQUATE SUPPORT FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES WHO WILL LIKELY FACE THE SAME CHALLENGES WHEN TESTIFYING IN COURT ABOUT PHYSICAL OR SEXUAL ABUSE THAT A CHILD UNDER TWELVE YEARS OF AGE WOULD FACE IT IS IMPORTANT WE RECOGNIZE THE REASON SUCH STATEMENTS ARE ADMISSIBLE IN COURT BY VICTIMS UNDER TWELVE AND EXTEND THE SAME PROTECTIONS TO VICTIMS WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. ON BEHALF OF THE TULARE OUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WE ASK THAT YOU STAND WITH VICTIMS OF ABUSE AND SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY IN THE ROOMTHAT WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS SUPPORT. NINE CATCH MY MOTION TO MOVE THE BILL I DID THANK YOU. ANY OF WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. YOU MAKE UP FOR. I SECOND THE MOTION BY THE WAY. OPPOSITION WEBER STATE. MARCO GEORGIAN I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION TO THE TWENTY SEVENTH AT- AS A PUBLIC DEFENDER OF OVER THIRTY YEARS I HAVE THE NUMBER OF CLIENTS WHO WERE. DEVELOPMENTALLY DELAYED OR HAD COGNITIVE ISSUES AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS YOU KNOW. WE USED TO SAY AND FEEL ABOUT THEM WAS THAT THEY WERE VERY COOPERATIVE. AND WHAT THAT MEANT WAS THAT IT IN A VERY BUSY PUBLIC DEFENDER LIFE WITH A HUGE CASELOAD. THAT MY CLIENTS WHO ARE DEVELOPMENTALLY DELAYED OFTEN JUST SAID YES TO WHATEVER ASKED. WHETHER OR NOT THEY UNDERSTOOD IT. AND MANY TIMES FELT A NEED TO MASK THEIR INABILITY TO COMPREHEND WHAT WAS HAPPENING. AND. MY HEART GOES OUT TO YOU HAVING YOU KNOW A CHILD WHO SUFFERS FROM THIS BUT I THINK THAT. THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT MEANS THAT THE NEEDS AND INTERESTS HAVE TO BE BALANCED. AND THE CURRENT LAW DOES THAT- TWENTY SEVENTEEN IS NOT NEEDED. PRIOR INCONSISTENT STATEMENTS CAN ALREADY BE ADMITTED. BY A WITNESS IF THEY HAVE SAID SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THEY SAY IN COURT. AND THERE'S A FUNDAMENTAL REASON THAT WE DON'T ACCEPT HEARSAY IN CRIMINAL TRIALS. AND IT'S BEEN SETTLED LAW FOR AT LEAST A HUNDRED AND TWENTY YEARS. AND THE ANALYSIS. IT TALKS ABOUT AN EARLY CASE MADDOX WHICH SAID THAT IT'S FUNDAMENTAL TO BE ABLE TO ASK YOUR ACCUSER QUESTIONS TO HAVE THE JURY BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THEM AND EVALUATE THEIR DEMEANOR. AND TO MAKE DRAW THEIR OWN CONCLUSIONS. AND THAT HERE SAY. IS FUNDAMENTALLY UNRELIABLE AND CAN LEAD TO- BE THE RESULT OF SUGGESTED QUESTIONING OR INTERVIEWING AND LEAD TO A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE. ALREADY ASK ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THEIR SPECIAL PROVISIONS AND COURT TO PROTECT DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED INDIVIDUALS ON JUDGES ARE ADVISED IN THEIR TRAINING AND BY LAW THEY MUST TAKE SPECIAL CARE TO MAKE SURE THAT DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED WITNESSES WITH A SUBSTANTIAL COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT ARE PROTECTED FROM UNDUE HARASSMENT OR EMBARRASSMENT. REPETITIVE UNNECESSARY QUESTIONING IS PROHIBITED. AND THE JUDGE IS SUPPOSED TO ENSURE THAT THE FORMER THE QUESTIONS ARE APPROPRIATE TO THE COGNITIVE LEVEL OF THE WITNESS. IF NECESSARY THE DA CAN APPLY FOR IN ORDER TO ADMIT THE PRIOR TESTIMONY FROM A PRELIMINARY HEARING. IF THE COURT FINDS THAT FURTHER TESTIMONY WOULD CAUSE SUCH EMOTIONAL TRAUMA OR MAKE THE VICTIM MEDICALLY UNABLE TO TESTIFY. OR IF THE VICTIM IS UNABLE TO TESTIFY AND I'M KIND OF SHAKING BECAUSE THE DOOR THAT THIS OPENS IS SO IMMENSE BECAUSE BASICALLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE BEING CONVICTED OF A CRIME. AND IT COULD RANGE FROM- A MISDEMEANOR TO A CRIME THAT WOULD PUT THEM AWAY FOR LIFE WITHOUT THE WITNESS EVER COMING TO COURT AND TESTIFYING. AND THERE ARE REAL PEOPLE WHO ARE HARM. I'M YOU HEARD EARLIER THIS MORNING ABOUT- PEOPLE WHO WERE HARMED THROUGH FALSE CONFECTIONS CASES ABOUT THE MEMBER ALLUDED TO. ON. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WERE WRONGLY CONVICTED- AND ONE OF THE MOST OF COURSE DRAMATIC ONES FIRST FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR THROUGH NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX AT LEAST THIRTY DEFENDANTS WERE CONVICTED OF CHILD SEX ABUSE AND RELATED CHARGES AND SENTENCED TO LONG PRISON TERMS IN A SERIES OF INTERRELATED CASES AND KERN COUNTY. OVER TIME TWENTY OF THE DEFENDANTS WHO WERE SENTENCED TO PRISON OR EXONERATED. THE EARLIEST IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE AND THE MOST RECENT ONE AND TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT. AND MOST OF THESE CASES. AND THESE ARE ABOUT CHILDREN WHO ARE TESTIFIED THAT THEY HAD BEEN ABUSED AND THEN LATER RECANTED THEIR TESTIMONY. AND THEY FOUND FROM THESE CASES BUT THESE WERE THE PRODUCT OF SUGGESTIVE QUESTIONING AND THIS IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF SITUATION THAT WOULD BE ALLOWED UNDER AB TWENTY SEVENTEEN. SO IT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE. YEAH I LET THE PROPONENTS GO ALONG CHARLOTTE TO DEFENSE COLOGNE. MORNING J. MEMBERS ARE KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF ACLU CAL ACTION BY THE WHIMS BEEN A SEA CAL ACTION WE HAVE SOME QUESTIONS AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE BILL INCLUDE FOR THE GUARDRAILS AROUND THE COURT DETERMINATION OF INDIVIDUAL HAVE MAKES AN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY WE DON'T WANT JUDGES TO BE IN THE PLACE OF MAKING THAT DETERMINATION SO SOLELY BY THEMSELVES. WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT'S APPROPRIATE SO WE LIKE TO SEE IN THE BILL JUST NO GUARDRAILS TO ENSURE THAT THE INTENDED-A GROUP OF POPULATION IS- CORRECTLY DIAGNOSE AND THAT'S DONE SO BY SOMEONE THAT IS- PROFESSIONALLY CREATE ABLE TO DIAGNOSE THE INDIVIDUAL IN ADDITIONAL COMMENTS MADE BY AS THE PDA SO AT THIS TIME WE MUST OPPOSE THE BILL. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE IN THE REAL LIKE TO EXPRESS OUR OPPOSITION. HI GOOD MORNING MISTER HERNANDEZ ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE ALSO NOT RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION THANK YOU LIKE TO EXPRESS EITHER SUPPORTER OPPOSITION THIS IS THEIR OPPORTUNITY WOULD LIKE TO HEAR.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR HAVE NO ONE ELSE CAN QUEUE AT THIS TIME OKAY WE'LL BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE DELICATE ISSUE AND- I FIND THE- THE OPPOSITION'S ARGUMENTS TO BE NON COMPELLING- I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT YOU CONTINUE TO TRY TO GET AS MUCH SUPPORT AS YOU CAN CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEIR CONCERNS BUT- I I'VE- AS A PERSON. IT HAS A DEGREE IN SPECIAL EDUCATION AND STARTED OFF AS A TEACHER WITH. FOR THAT HAD LEARNING DISABILITIES I AM VERY SENSITIVE. TO THE DELICATE NATURE OF- TRAGEDIES THAT. THE TAKE PLACE AND I THINK EVERYBODY ON THIS COMMITTEE. WOULD- I FELT THAT SAME FEELING. BUT I APPRECIATE. THE ADVOCACY THAT THIS BILL PROVIDES AND I COMPLETELY SUPPORT IT AND- I'M I'M THANKING YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO ADDRESS IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND- MISS BONTA. OR MR BRIAN PARENTS WERE PHOSPHORUS FOR TWENTY SIX YEARS AND YOU FOR THE MOST PART SPECIAL NEEDS FOSTER PARENTS- TO MY ADD UP LITTLE BROTHERS AND SPECIAL NEEDS ONE WHO HAS TROUBLE PAUL THE ONE WHO HAS SEVERE AUTISM. AND THIS IS A VERY COMPLICATED BILL WITH RIGHTEOUS INTENTIONS I THINK ANY TIME YOU CREATE A HEARSAY EXCEPTION IT. ALSO VIOLATES SIX AMENDMENT PROTECTIONS IN THE CONSTITUTION AND THAT'S VERY TOUGH. THERE ARE SOME GUARDRAILS ALREADY IN PLACE AND INCLUDING. JURIES BEEN INSTRUCTED NOT TO JUDGE THE CREDIBILITY OF A WITNESS BASED SOLELY ON THEIR DISABILITY. FOUND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR. FOR WORKING ON THIS ISSUE. AND I THINK IT'S TIMELY THAT IT WAS BROUGHT. THE SAME DAY AS- ANOTHER BILL WE HEARD EARLIER. WHERE TESTIMONY THAT'S GATHERED IN THE EVIDENCE GATHERING PROCESS CAN BE. SUGGESTED AND THEN TO HAVE THAT LEGITIMIZED IN COURT WITHOUT THE PRIMARY WITNESS BEEN PRESENT IS TOUGH- OVERALL I HOPE THAT IF THIS BILL MOVES OR DOESN'T MOVE IT'S AN ISSUE CONTINUE TO WORK ON WITH THE OPPOSITION WITH THE FAMILIES WERE IMPACTED AND AGAIN JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR. PROVIDING YES BONTA. I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT AND I APPRECIATED THAT TESTIMONY THAT THAT OF. OPPOSITION PROVIDING THAT THE CURRENT LAW ALSO ALLOWS THE PROSECUTION TO APPLY FOR A COURT ORDER TO TAPE THE PRELIMINARY HEARING TESTIMONY. OF A DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED VICTIM OF CERTAIN SEX OFFENSES. AND THERE'S ALSO IN THERE THE ABILITY FOR PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES TO- HAVE THEIR TEST AND FORMER TESTIMONY AT TRIAL- IF THE COURT SHOULD FIND A TO HAVE THAT TESTIMONY T. SO I'M JUST OUT WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM THE AUTHOR- JUST HOW THE INTENTION. I HEARD THAT YOU TOOK AN AMENDMENT TO REMOVE THE- HAVING A PARALLEL WITH AT A COGNITIVE. ABILITY INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY THAT- UP TO THE AGE OF TWELVE SO I WANTED TO JUST HEAR A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT AS WELL- BEFORE I DECIDE. THROUGH THE CHAIR WE WANT MANAGING OUR IT IS CLOSE THE CLOSEST FINE THANK YOU WAS THE ARE I'M CAR OF HEARING WHAT WAS YOUR THAT YOU WANT. HI- WE WANTED IT CLARIFIED THE GUARDRAILS AROUND THE COURT'S DETERMINATION THAT THE INDIVIDUAL HAS AN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THAT'S DONE TO SOMEONE WHO HAS A PROFESSIONAL CAPACITY TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION WE THINK THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE CLARIFIED- IN THE BILL. IN THE BUILDING OKAY SO CLARIFICATION OF WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE A DISABILITY WELL FOR THE COURT TO DETERMINE THAT WE WOULDN'T OKAY JUDGE TO BE MAKING THAT DECISION BASED ON A CONVERSATION OF THAT NATURE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S- CLARIFIED IN THE BUILDING. THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY OTHER. YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- TO ADDRESS THE AMENDMENTS FIRST- BARCA IN IT AND THROUGH SOME OF THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION AND THINGS HAVING THE- AGE SPECIFIED VERSUS HAVING- THE VERBIAGE SAY- SOMEONE WITH AN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY KIND OF GOES TO THE POINTS OF CLARIFICATION- THAT ACLU'S ASKING FOR BECAUSE YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE SOMEBODY THAT IS A CONDITION THAT COULD VERIFY. THAT THE INDIVIDUAL DOES INDEED HAVE THE DISABILITY- SO THAT AMENDMENT DOES KIND OF ADDRESS THE ACLU'S POINT ON IF THERE'S ANY OTHER AMENDMENTS I'M AGAIN I'M ALWAYS HAPPY TO TAKE THEM INTO WORK MOVING FORWARD TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS A JUST BILL BECAUSE THERE THERE ARE VICTIMS HERE THEY'RE FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS- TO ADDRESS THE POINTS- MADE BY SOME THE OPPOSITION I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND IMPERATIVE. OF US THAT WE ADDRESS WHAT THE SIXTH AMENDMENT ACCUSER MEANS IN THIS CASE AND WHAT THE EXISTING HERE SAY ROLE IS. THE SIXTH AMENDMENT AND ALL CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS THE ACCUSED SHALL ENJOY THE RIGHT TO. TO BE CONFRONTED WITH THE WITNESSES AGAINST THEM. AGAIN IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE REMEMBER WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. THE VIOLATION UNDER CURRENT LAW THE SIXTH AMENDMENT DOES NOT APPLY TO CHILDREN UNDER TWELVE YEARS OF AGE. SO WE ARE HAPPY TO BEND AND TWEAK THESE ROLES. FOR SOMEBODY WHO'S UNDER TWELVE. BUT NOT FOR A CHILD WHO IS OVER TWELVE. CHAU BEFORE CURRENTLY GOING TO ACCEPT THAT A TWELVE YEAR OLD WHO IS OF NORMAL COGNITIVE ABILITY IT'S OKAY TO APPLY HERE SEVERAL. BEFORE A CHILD WHO IS THIRTEEN WITH AN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY WE ARE NOT GOING TO APPLY THE SAME RULE JUST. AND HOW THAT'S FAIR ESPECIALLY FOR SOMEBODY WHO MIGHT BE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN FIFTEEN WITH AN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY. AS A FATHER. WITH THE SUN WHO LIVES IN A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH HOME I CANNOT IMAGINE PUTTING HIM ON THE STAND AND HAVING THEM CROSS EXAMINED. BECAUSE I KNOW THE COGNITIVE ABILITY ISSUE. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY AMENDMENTS. TO MAKE THIS THE DISK CLERICALLY DEFINITIVE AS POSSIBLE I ALWAYS HAVE BEEN AND I'M COMPLETELY OPEN TO THAT MOVING FORWARD. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS VERY SPECIFIC THERE'S EVIDENCE THERE TO SAY THIS PERSON DOES HAVE AN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY THAT WE ARE FOLLOWING THE SAME ROLE THIS IS APPLIED FOR TWELVE YEAR OLDS MEMBERS I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE IN YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU- MISTER GRAYSON I THINK WOULD ALSO OPEN WITH ONLY HE WAS ONLY ALLOWED TO PRESENT NOT TO CLOSE OKAY- IT I THAT I AND I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT HEARING FROM MR GRAYSON I HAD THE BUDGET COMMITTEE TO GO TO AND I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO HEAR ANY OTHER WITNESSES- ANALOGY AND- MISTER CHAIR THE- I'M ON A TIME. FOR TRYING TO GET TO GET OUT OF HERE. AND SO I'M GONNA MAKE THIS OFFER- THE AUTHOR AND I. HAVE NOT AGREED ON THIS. BUT I'M WILLING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR. WORK WITH. THE PEOPLE WERE SPONSORING AN ADVOCATE SO WE BECAUSE I'M WHAT I'M HEARING FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT THERE COULD BE SOME AMENDMENTS TAKEN WHICH- WE'RE NOT. WE COULDN'T GET TO THAT BEFORE THIS WE NEEDED THIS THIS HEARING TO GET TO WHERE PEOPLE WERE WILLING TO TAKE AMENDMENTS BUT THE OTHER THING IS TO HEAR FROM BOTH SIDES TO UNDERSTAND BOTH SIDES I THINK WE'RE NOW TO POINT WE'RE HEARING BOTH SIDES I DO NOT WANT TO LEAVE DISK. COMMITTEE BECAUSE I DON'T WANT THIS TO BE POLITICIZED. I WANT US TO WORK ON THIS IN A FAIR WAY SOLUTION THAT WORKS FOR BOTH SIDES. HEARSAY AND CRIMINALLY SENDING PEOPLE OF COLOR TO JAIL THAT ABILITY TO DO IT. REALLY IS IMPORTANT TO ME AS IT IS A BLUE ULTIMATELY IMPORTANT FOR YOU WHICH I BELIEVE THERE ARE SOME SAFEGUARDS FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE. DEMENTED BUT DEVELOPMENTALLY. PROBLEMS THAT THAT WE DO HAVE THAT IN IN IN THE LAW RIGHT NOW IT WAS READ BY. MISS BONTA. IT SEEMS I JUST DON'T WANT THAT IGNORED. IF IT'S NOT IF THAT NEEDS TO BE CLARIFIED WHAT THAT GIVES FAMILIES. HIS FAMILY SOME ASSURANCES THAT THEIR FAMILIES WON'T BE BE TRAUMATIZED IN COURT WRITERS VIDEOTAPING OR WHATEVER IF WE NEED TO CLARIFY THAT TO PROTECT THEM. THEN WITH THE EXISTING LAWS THAT WE HAVE AND THEN I'M PERFECTLY WILLING TO DO THAT I WOULD HOPE THAT THE BILL DOES NOT LEAVE HERE. BECAUSE ONCE YOU GET OUT OF HERE I HAVE NO IDEA WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND THAT WE ASK FOR RECONSIDERATION IF IT DOESN'T GET OUT OF THIS BUT UNFORTUNATELY CHAIRS- KALRA RECOMMEND A NO VOTE. AND THEN. WE'LL GO FROM THERE IF I MAY ASK FOR. THE COMMITTEE TO TABLE. THE BILL UNTIL THE FURTHER DAYS WE CAN HAVE TIME TO WORK ON THESE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU SUGGEST YEAH. SO I'M GOING TO.

THANK YOU. A LITTLE. MISTER RODRIGUEZ I THINK I SAW. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY MISTER RODRIGUEZ. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY ONE WHICH WOULD ALLOW ARRESTING AGENCIES TO RECOVER THE BOOKING BECAUSE OF INDIVIDUALS ARRESTED FOR SEX PURCHASING. CALIFORNIA AND THE LAW SAYS REGION PARTICULAR HAS THE HIGHEST RATE OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN THE NATION. THE NUMBER OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING CASE REPORTED IN CALIFORNIA INCREASED TWENTY EIGHTEEN. DESPITE THIS SOME DISTRICT ATTORNEYS DO NOT PROSECUTE INDIVIDUALS ARRESTED. FOR THE ACT OF PURCHASING SEX IN PLACES LIKE POMONA WHICH IS IN MY DISTRICT. THIS REFUSAL TO PROSECUTE HAS LED TO AN INCREASE IN ILLEGAL PROSTITUTION AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR DECADES. AB TWENTY OR FIFTY ONE OR CREATE A PENALTY FOR INDIVIDUALS ARRESTED FOR SEX PURCHASING CREATING A STRONGER DETERRENT FOR SUCH BEHAVIOR. AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY ONE PROVIDED TOOL FOR ARRESTING AGENCIES TO USE SHOULD THEY CHOOSE IN ADDRESSING PROSTITUTION AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING CASES. WITH ME PROVIDE. IN PERSON TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE SERGEANT BRETT PAULSON. WITH THE POMONA POLICE DEPARTMENT THANK YOU. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY SIR GOOD MORNING THE MORNING'S BRAD PAULSON I'M THE SERGEANT OF THE QUALITY OF LIFE UNIT WITH THE POMONA POLICE DEPARTMENT AND WE ALSO REPRESENT THE SEXUAL EXPLOITATION AND TRAFFICKING TEAM. HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS A CRIME THAT INVOLVES COMPELLING- COURSING A PERSON TO PROVIDE LABOR SERVICES. OR TO ENGAGE IN COMMERCIAL SEX ACTS THE COERCION CAN BE SUBTLE OR OVERT PHYSICAL OR PSYCHOLOGICAL AND MAY INVOLVE THE USE OF VIOLENCE THREATS LIES OR DEBT BONDAGE. EXPLOITATION OF A MINOR FOR COMMERCIAL SEX HUMAN TRAFFICKING REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY FORM OF FORCE FRAUD OR COERCION WAS USED. THE UNITED STATES IS WIDELY REGARDED AS A DESTINATION COUNTRY FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING. THE REQUIRED SAID ESTIMATED THAT 1-400-050-0217 THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED VICTIMS ARE TRAFFICKED INTO THE UNITED STATES ANNUALLY. THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE THE NUMBER OF VICTIMS WERE TRAFFICKED WITHIN THE UNITED STATES EACH YEAR. ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL HUMAN TRAFFICKING HOTLINE TRAFFICKING REPORT IN THE UNITED STATES IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE LARGEST SITES OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN THE UNITED STATES. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FIFTY SIX CASES OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING REPORTING CALIFORNIA. OF THOSE ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SIX WERE SEX TRAFFICKING CASES. THERE IS NO SINGLE PROFILE OF A TRAFFICKING VICTIM VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING INCLUDE NOT ONLY MEN AND WOMEN LOWERED INTO FORCED LABOR BY THE PROMISE OF A BETTER LIFE UNITED STATES. BUT ALSO BOYS AND GIRLS WERE BORN AND RAISED HERE IN CALIFORNIA. TRAFFICKING VICTIMS COME FROM A DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS IN TERMS OF RACE COLOR NATIONAL ORIGIN DISABILITY. RELIGION AGE GENDER SEXUAL ORIENTATION GENDER IDENTITY. SOCIO ECONOMIC STATUS EDUCATION LEVEL AND CITIZENSHIP CITIZENSHIP STATUS. BUT ONE CHARACTERISTIC THAT THEY USUALLY SHARE IT IS SOME FORM OF VULNERABILITY. TRAFFICKING VICTIMS ARE OFTEN ISOLATED FROM THEIR FAMILIES AND SOCIAL NETWORKS AND IN SOME CASES ARE SEPARATED FROM THEIR COUNTRY OF ORIGIN NATIVE LANGUAGE AND CULTURE. MANY DOMESTIC VICTIMS OF SEX TRAFFICKING ARE RUNAWAY OR HOMELESS YOUTH AND OR COME FROM BACKGROUNDS OF SEXUAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL ABUSE AND SAYS POVERTY OR ADDICTION. AUTHORS EXPLOIT THESE VULNERABILITIES PROMISING THE VICTIMS LOVE A GOOD JOB OR A MORE STABLE LIFE. HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS AMONG THE WORLD'S FASTEST GROWING CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE AND IS ESTIMATED TO BE A ONE HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION DOLLAR A YEAR GLOBAL INDUSTRY. IS A FORM OF MODERN DAY SLAVERY THAT PROFITS FROM THE EXPLOITATION OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. HUMAN TRAFFICKING STRIPS VICTIMS OF THEIR FREEDOM AND VIOLATES OUR NATION'S PROMISE THAT EVERY PERSON IN THE UNITED STATES IS GUARANTEED BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS. THE INTERNATIONAL LABOR ORGANIZATION ESTIMATES THAT THERE ARE MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR POINT NINE MILLION HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS WORLDWIDE ANYTIME THIS INCLUDES FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION VICTIMS OF SEXUAL EXPLOITATION. THE VICTIMS OF SEX TRAFFICKING ARE OFTEN YOUNG GIRLS AND WOMEN WHO MAKE UP AN ESTIMATED NINETY NINE POINT 4% OF SEX TRAFFICKING VICTIMS. RECENT YEARS TRANSNATIONAL CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS AND AFFILIATED DOMESTIC GANGS HAVE EXPANDED FROM DRUG AND FIREARM TRAFFICKING TO THE TRAFFICKING OF HUMAN BEINGS. IN THE PAST THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE IS ESTIMATED THAT FOURTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED VICTIMS ARE TRAFFICKED INTO THE NIGHT STATES EACH YEAR. THIS FIGURE DOES NOT INCLUDE VICTIMS ARE TRAFFICKED WITHIN THE COUNTRY EACH YEAR CALIFORNIA POPULOUS BORDER STATE WITH A SIGNIFICANT IMMIGRANT. POPULATION HAS THE WORLD'S FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IS ONE OF THE NATION'S TOP DESTINATION STATES FOR TRAFFICKING HUMAN BEINGS. THE PERPETRATORS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING HAVE BECOME MORE SOPHISTICATED ORGANIZED REQUIRING EQUALLY SOPHISTICATED RESPONSE FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ITS PARTNERS TO DISRUPT AND DISMANTLE THEIR NETWORKS. STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS TAKEN STEPS TO FIGHT HUMAN TRAFFICKING SUCH AS THE PASSAGE OF SENATE BILL ELEVEN NINETY THREE SENATE BILL TWO TWENTY FIVE ASSEMBLY BILL TWO SIXTY ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY THIRTY FOUR. AND SENATE BILL SIX THIRTY. PROSTITUTION IS OFTEN REFERRED TO AS THE OLDEST PROFESSION THE WORLD AND IS OFTEN ARE HONESTLY LABELED A VICTIMLESS CRIME. IN OVER TWENTY YEARS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT THE MAJORITY OF WHICH HAVE BEEN SPENT INVESTIGATING PROSTITUTION AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING RELATED CRIMES. I CANNOT REMEMBER A SINGLE VICTIM THAT HAS EVER TOLD ME THEY WERE ENGAGED IN A TRADE BY CHOICE. THE MAJORITY OF SHARED STORIES OF BEING COERCED INTO LIFESTYLES A MINOR BY A TRAFFICKER WHO PROVIDED A FALSE SENSE OF LOVE AND SECURITY AT A TIME THEY WERE MOST VULNERABLE. MOST EXPRESSED FEELING TRAPPED AND UNABLE TO LEAVE THE TRADE AS THEY HAD NOWHERE ELSE TO GO THE NO OTHER MEANS OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT. LIVING ON THE STREETS MOVING FROM MOTEL TO MOTEL AND CITY TO CITY IS NOT A CHOICE. SEX WORK LIKE ANY OTHER INDUSTRY IS BASED ON THE SIMPLE BUSINESS MODEL OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND. THE HIGHER THE DEMAND THE MORE INCENTIVE TO RECRUIT NEW WORKERS BY SEX TRAFFICKERS. AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY ONE AIMS TO REDUCE THE DEMAND BY INCREASING THE FINANCIAL PENALTIES SEX PURCHASERS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE VICTIMIZATION OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS. WELL I CANNOT SPEAK FOR THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I CAN CONFIRM THAT THE MAJORITY OF SEX PURCHASERS ARRESTED IN THE CITY OF HOMEOWNER ARE NOT FROM OUR COMMUNITY. THESE PREDATORS COME FROM ALL OVER THE REGION PLACING STRAIN ON PUBLIC SERVICES AND DRASTICALLY IMPACTING THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF OUR RESIDENTS AND BUSINESS OWNERS. AS MANY ELECTED PROSECUTORS ACROSS THE NATION SEEK ALTERNATIVES TO INCARCERATION. ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY ONE FIFTY ONE PROVIDES A DETERRENT TO SEX PURCHASERS WATER FOLLOWING THIS MODEL. BASED ON THE AVERAGE TIME TO RIP PROCESS IN A REST OF THE SIX PURCHASER. WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY TWO POINT TWO ONE HOURS. THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF POLICE OFFICERS HOURLY PAY RATE THE ANTICIPATED FIND WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO DOLLARS AND FORTY CENTS. WELL THIS DOES NOT COVER THE IMMEDIATE COSTS OF THE OFFICER WHAT IT DOES COVER THE MEDIA COST OF DOCTORS TIME IT IN NO WAY TRULY COVERS THE FULL COST OF THE ENTIRE INVESTIGATION. THE INTENT BEHIND AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY ONE IS NOT TO INCENTIVIZE LAW ENFORCEMENT TO FOCUS ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS ON A SPECIFIC CRIME. BUT RATHER TO OFFER YOU TURNED TO SEX PURCHASERS. MODELED AFTER CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT CODE FIFTY THREE ONE FIFTY PASSED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE WHICH ALLOWS FOR RECOVERY FROM RICH RESPONSE. TO AN ACCIDENT RELATED TO A DRIVER FOUND TO BE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL. BOOKING COSTS INCURRED BY OR IMPOSED UPON THE ARRESTING AGENCY CAN BE RECOVERED. THESE FEES WILL GO BACK TO THE GENERAL FUND OF THE GOVERNING BODY HAVING JURISDICTION OVER CITY AGENCY TO BE UTILIZED AS SEEN FIT BY ELECTED OFFICIALS. PROGRAMS TO INCLUDE PROVIDING YOUTH ASSISTANCE DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPORT ANTI HUMAN TRAFFICKING EDUCATIONAL CAMPAIGNS.

MORE SPECIFICALLY WE HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE IN VICTIMS COMING INTO% CALIFORNIA FROM OTHER STATES. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE CONTACTED THIRTY VICTIMS FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS ALONE. IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS PRIOR WE HAD ONLY CONTACTED NINE. WE'VE ENCOUNTERED VICTIMS FROM NEARLY ALL FIFTY STATES OVER THE PAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGAIN THE DEMAND IN CALIFORNIA IS HIGH IN PART DUE TO A LACK OF DETERRENCE.

THE MILITARY MERECE ON BEHALF OF THE ONTARIO POLICE DEPARTMENT IN SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME. NOW WE HEAR FROM WITNESSES OPPOSITION. AGAIN YEP FIVE MINUTES. THANK A CREAMER MATTER ON BEHALF OF ACLU CALIFORNIA ACTION AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY ONE WHICH WOULD MOVE THE STATE BACKWARDS BY IMPOSING NEW RACIALLY DISPARATE FEES AND HARMING SEX WORKERS AND PEOPLE WHO ARE TRAFFICKED. AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY ONE WILL CREATE MORE DANGEROUS WORKING CONDITIONS FOR PEOPLE ENGAGED IN SEX TRADES. AS AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL HAS NOTED REGARDLESS OF THEIR INTENTION LAWS AGAINST BUYING FACT OFTEN MEAN THAT SEX WORKERS HAVE TO TAKE MORE RISKS TO PROTECT BUYERS FROM DETECTION BY POLICE COUNTRIES HAVE PUSH SEX WORKERS TO OPERATE UNDER RISKIER CONDITIONS WITH HARMFUL IMPLICATIONS FOR THEIR HEALTH. INCLUDING A DECREASE IN CONDOM USE AND INCREASED DRUG AND ALCOHOL USE DEPRESSION AND SUICIDAL THOUGHTS AND VIOLENCE AGAINST SEX WORKERS. HAS ONE SEX WORKER PUT IT EVER SINCE THE LAW CHANGED THE WORST CRIMES ATTACKS RAPES AND ROBBERIES HAVE INCREASED. ADDITIONALLY AN ARREST FOR LOITERING WITH INTENT IS COMPLETELY SUBJECTIVE RELYING ON A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. TO INTO IT THAT A PERSON HAS SUCH INTENT BASED ON NOT OFFICERS BIAS EASE. BETWEEN JANUARY TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND SEPTEMBER TWENTY NINETEEN LATINOS MADE UP SEVENTY POINT 5% OF THOSE CHARGED UNDER SIX FORTY SEVEN BEATS AN LA. INDICATING RACIAL BIAS IN WHO IS PERCEIVED BY POLICE AS A CLIENT OF SEX WORKERS. THE PROVISION OF THIS BILL CREATE HARMFUL FINANCIAL INCENTIVES THAT WILL ONLY INTENSIFY THE CURRENT RACIAL DISPARITIES IN POLICING AND ARREST RATES. AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY ONE WHAT ALSO CREATE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR ARRESTING A PERSON EVEN IF THE CHARGES ARE DROPPED OR THE PERSON NOT FOUND NOT GUILTY. THE ARRESTING AGENCY WOULD GET TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH THE FEE WOULD BE. AND IF THE PERSON ARRESTED HAS THE MONEY TIME AND ABILITY TO CHALLENGE THE FEE THAT SEEM AGENCY WOULD ALSO GET TO DECIDE THE OUTCOME OF THE CHALLENGE. AS A MEMBER OF THE DEBT FREE JUSTICE COALITION WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY FOUGHT FOR MEANINGFUL RELIEF FROM OVERLY BURDENSOME AND PROGRESSIVE FINES AND FEES IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY ONE WOULD BE A STEP BACKWARDS ON THE PROGRESS CALIFORNIA HAS MADE. AND WOULD HARM SEX WORKERS AND PEOPLE TRAFFICKED. FOR THESE REASONS ACLU CALIFORNIA OPPOSES AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY ONE. THANK YOU MARCO GEORGE ON BEHALF OF THE CAN YOU MOVE THAT MICROPHONE OKAY CERTAINLY THANK YOU. MARGO GEORGE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION A RESPECTFULLY WE OPPOSE THE BILL- AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY ONE WELL NOT JUST HER SEX TRAFFICKING. ON THE AUTHOR IS QUOTED IN THE ANALYSIS OF STATING CURRENT PUNISHMENTS HAVE BEEN THE HAVE NOT BEEN EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING SEX PURCHASING AND TRAFFICKING. AND CURRENT PUNISHMENT RUNS THE GAMUT NOW FROM SIX MONTHS THAT AND COUNTY JAIL TO LIFE IN PRISON SO BOOKING FEES ARE NOT GOING TO END ON. SEX TRAFFICKING OR- ON PROSTITUTION HOWEVER ONE THING TO BEAR IN MIND IS THAT PEOPLE THAT THESE FEES WILL AFFECT OUR AS- THE ACLU STATED ARE POOR PEOPLE BECAUSE- RICH PEOPLE WHO ARE PURCHASE SEX DO IT ON THE INTERNET- THEY BELONG TO CLUBS THEY'RE NOT PICKING PEOPLE UP ON STREET. AND AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY ONE FIFTY ONE WILL IMPOVERISH MORE CALIFORNIANS OF JUST TWO YEARS AGO THE LEGISLATURE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BOOKING FEES DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD. AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY NINE THE COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGETS TWENTY TWENTY BILL ABOLISHING BOOKING FEES THE LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS STATED APPROXIMATELY 80% OF CALIFORNIANS IN JAIL OR INDIGENT DISPROPORTIONATELY BLACK OR LATIN NEXT. THE AVERAGE DEBT INCURRED FOR RESPONDENTS AND CARD FOR COURT ORDERED FINES AND FEES WAS ROUGHLY EQUAL TO THE ANNUAL INCOME FOR RESPONDENTS IN THIS SURVEY BY ELLA BAKER CENTER INCARCERATED PEOPLE FOUND THAT FAMILIES OFTEN BEAR THE BRUNT OF FEES THE BURDEN AND THAT 83% OF THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THESE COSTS ARE WOMEN. SO THIS WILL NOT HELP WOMEN WHO ARE SEX TRAFFICKED. FEES AND ARE IN FINES ARE OFTEN ASSIGNED TO PEOPLE WHO SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY THEM THEY MAKE POOR PEOPLE THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES POOR. CRIMINAL JUSTICE FEES HAVE NO FORMAL PUNITIVE OUR PUBLIC SAFETY FUNCTION. THIS IS AGAIN THE LEGISLATIVE FINDING FROM THE BUDGET BILL JUST TWO YEARS AGO. THEY LIMIT ACCESS TO EMPLOYMENT HOUSING EDUCATION AND PUBLIC BENEFITS AND THEY CREATE ADDITIONAL BARRIERS TO SUCCESSFUL RE ENTRY. MOREOVER COUNTIES AND MUNICIPALITIES CAN'T COLLECT THE FEES IN THE FIRST PLACE THEY SPEND MORE MONEY TRYING TO COLLECT THEM THAN THEY EVER GET BACK. SO FOR ALL OF THOSE REASONS WITH RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE ON A B. TWENTY ONE FIFTY ONE THANK YOU- ANYONE ELSE IN THE ROOM. IN OPPOSITION. WHEN BACK IS FOR ELEVATOR CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN OPPOSITION. ALY SLACK I AM ALSO- IN STRONG OPPOSITION- I DON'T SACRAMENTO THANK YOU. BUT NOW GO TO THE PHONE LINES EIGHTEEN T. OPERATOR AND- WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY ONE RODRIGUEZ. TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. MISTER CHAIR WE HAVE KNOWN QUEUED UP. THANK YOU BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE. YES WITH THE COURT- SO THE LAST IN PERSON DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION. WE HAVE A DEMONSTRATION BY A BUNCH OF YOUNG WOMEN SAME SEX WORK IS REAL WORK AND ASKING FOR CHANGES IN THESE LAWS EIGHT YEARS AGO AFTER HEARING WHEN I WAS CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE ENGAGED IN. SEX WORK WHO WANT TO BE ENGAGED IN SEX WORK SOMETIMES STILL YOU KNOW I'VE TALKED TO THEM THOSE SAY THIS IS MEMBER WE HAVE THE KEY WITNESS SAYING THAT THIS IS SOMETHING I WILL DO MY ENTIRE LIFE AND SHE WAS ALREADY IN HER FORTIES. OR MAYBE FIFTIES. I DON'T KNOW IF THE CHAIRMAN REMEMBER THAT BUT- REALLY THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THIS YOUR VOLUNTARY NOW WHAT YOUR WITNESS- ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ TALKED ABOUT WAS SEX TRAFFICKING WHICH- EVERYONE OF US IS AGAINST. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS LAWS ABOUT THIS LAWS ABOUT- PROSTITUTION OR SEX WORKERS I PREFER TO CALL IT GENERALLY- THE BEST WAY TO PREVENT HUMAN TRAFFICKING WOULD BE TO LEGALIZE SEX WORK. THEN YOU WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY AS THEY DO IN CERTAIN COUNTIES IN NEVADA OF BOTH TESTING THE YOUNG WOMEN FOR- SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE DOING THIS VOLUNTARILY. THAT'S THE WAY TO PREVENT SEX TRAFFICKING SO FOR THOSE REASONS I CAN'T SUPPORT YOUR BILL AT THIS TIME I WOULD PREFER A DIFFERENT APPROACH. WHERE WE WOULD IN FACT LEGALIZE SEX WORK BUT PREVENT- HUMAN TRAFFICKING FOR SEX THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MISTER BRIAN- THE BIGGEST PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THE BILL IS JUST THE CONSISTENCY WITH THE IF CONVICTED THIS ISN'T IT IT WILL BE ALLOWING FOR THE BOOKING FEES TO THEN STILL BEING COLLECTED AND RETAINED REGARDLESS OF CONVICTION STATUS OR ACQUITTAL OR HAVING THE CHARGES DROPPED DUE TO LACK OF EVIDENCE SEEMS- BEYONC UNITIVE AND SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO ROLL BACK FOR SEVERAL YEARS THOSE KINDS OF FINES AND FEES AND SO. WITH THAT A CONSISTENCY IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING I CAN'T. SUPPORT TODAY MAY CLOSE MISTER ROGERS. WHAT WHAT THAT SAID OUR- REALLY LIKE TO INVITE THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE AND- FOLKS IN THIS ROOM TO SEE WHERE PROSTITUTION HAS DONE TO. MY DISTRICT AND CITY OF POMONA OF HAS DEVASTATED THIS COMMUNITY SPECIAL LONG THE BUSINESS FRONT WERE A LOT OF THIS HAS BEEN DONE FOR DECADES IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE GOING AWAY IF ANYTHING IT'S GOTTEN WORSE BECAUSE THE PANDEMIC. IF THIS ISN'T THE RIGHT WAY TO APPROACH IT. I'M WILLING TO WORK WITH ANYBODY HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE IN THIS ROOM TO SEE HOW WE CAN ADDRESS THIS. LEGALIZING IT IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT SUBJECT I DON'T KNOW HAS ITS OWN ISSUES WELL BUT THE FACT THAT- IT'S DEVASTATING TO MY COMMUNITY IN THE RESOURCE IS TAKEN FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT TO TAKE HIM OUT. OFF THE STREETS TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES IS DEVASTATING SO WITH THAT SAID I RESPECT US FOR I WROTE IN HOPES THAT YOU CAN HELP ME- DRESSED AS A BIGGER ONCE AGAIN. A HUGE IMPACT. DE AND UPON RUN COMMITTEES THANK YOU. IN THEN I WANT TO THANK YOU. AN INMATE EVEN TO YOU UP ON IT IT'S THIS BILL DOESN'T GET OUT- ASSEMBLY MEMBER. TASHA BOERNER HORVATH- PROBABLY BRING IN A BILL.

UP I HOPE THAT YOU'RE SINCERE IN WANTING TO WORK WITH- THE DISTINGUISHED SIMPLY WOMAN BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS THE FIRST THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST BILL THAT NOT ONLY ADDRESSES IT FROM A- FROM A LEGAL STANDPOINT WITH WITH POLICIES. AND PROCEDURES BUT ALSO PUT SOME MONEY BEHIND IT- I WILL TELL YOU DOESN'T GO AS FAR AS WHAT MR CORK WOULD LIKE TO DO BUT IT DIDN'T. I THINK IT'S RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE AND BOOKABLE ADDRESS- A LOT OF YOUR CONCERNS AS AND LET'S IF IT DOESN'T MAKE IT OUT HERE LET'S LET'S REALLY HAVE DEBT SERVICE CONVERSATION AND- HOPE YOU TALK TO THEASSEMBLY WOMAN UP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SO THAT IF THIS IS SOMETHING YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH YOU WANT TO JOIN- BUT I ALSO OFFER.

SEYARTO HI THEY ARE TOO HIGH. A MEASURE FAILS. AB SO YOU'RE ASKING FOR RECONSIDERATION THAT'S GONNA RECONSIDERATION THERE'S NO OBJECTION WE WILL GRANT RECONSIDERATION BY UNANIMOUS CONSENT THANK YOU KNOW FOLLOW QUOTE ASSEMBLY MEMBER PORTHOLE LIKE THIS ONE THANK YOU. M. REBECCA ASSEMBLY WOMAN REBEKAH BAUR QUE HAN. WE HAVE TO BUILD YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR YOUR PATIENCE FINALLY WERE ABLE TO- COMMITTEE UPSTAIRS. WHICH WILL REACH DO YOU WANT TO DO FIRST I WILL START WITH THE AB TWENTY EIGHTY THREE IF THAT'S OKAY. OKAY. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY TO GO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO START BY ACTUALLY THINKING THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR HARD WORK. ON ALL THREE OF MY BILLS INCLUDING AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY FOUR WHICH THERE ARE HARD WORK WAS ABLE TO GET IN CONSENT WHICH I KNOW IS BIG HELP TO THE COMMITTEE TODAY- BUT RIGHT NOW I'M PRESENTING AB TWENTY EIGHTY THREE. A BILL THAT STRENGTHENS CRIMINAL FINES AGAINST CORPORATIONS WHO ARE CONVICTED OF STARTING WILDFIRES DUE TO A LACK OF EDUCATION ABATEMENT. AROUND POWER LINES. IN CALIFORNIA NO INDIVIDUALS INCARCERATED WHEN A CORPORATION IS FOUND GUILTY OF CRIMES IN WHICH THE PENALTY WOULD BE JAIL OR PRISON. THE PENALTIES AVAILABLE ARE FISCAL. IN TWENTY TWENTY THE CAMPFIRE STARTED WHEN UNMAINTAINED ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT FAILED SPARKING ON MAIN TAIN VEGETATION BELOW THE POWER LINES CAUSING A FIRE THAT DESTROYED AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND TOOK THE LIVES EIGHTY FOUR INDIVIDUALS. WITH ONLY FINANCIAL PENALTIES AVAILABLE BUTTE COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE MICHAEL DEEMS IMPOSED THE HARSHEST PENALTY ALLOWED UNDER CURRENT LAW AGAINST PG&amp;E WHICH AMOUNTED TO THREE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS. THE EQUIVALENT OF THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER LIFE LOST. YOU CAN'T PUT AN AMOUNT OF MONEY ON A LIFE LOST BUT THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE JUSTICE TO ME. THIS IS A CORPORATION BEING SLAPPED ON ITS WRIST WITH A MINIMAL FINE THE COURT'S HANDS ARE TIED TO THE LOW MAXIMUM FINES UNDER CURRENT LAW. IN JUDGE ALSUP'S FINAL COMMENTS ON THE EXPIRATION OF P. GENIES PROBATION IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR HE SAID. IN PROBATION WITH THE GOAL OF REHABILITATION IN MIND WE ALWAYS PREFER THAT THE CRIMINAL OFFENDERS LEARN TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR ACTIONS. SADLY DURING THE FIVE YEARS OF PROBATION PG&amp;E HAS REFUSED TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY I AM INTEREST TO DO SO DURING THE FIVE YEAR PROBATION FOR THAT GAS PIPELINE EXPLOSION IN SAN BRUNO WHICHKILLED EIGHT PEOPLE P. GENIES MALFEASANCE AT THIRTY ONE WILDFIRES BURNED NEARLY ONE AND A HALF MILLION ACRES BURNED ALMOST TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND STRUCTURES AND KILLED ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN CALIFORNIANS. ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER SOME LOUDER THAN WORDS AND THE ACTIONS TO BE CLEAR THAT THE OMPANY IS USING PROFITS OVER THE SAFETY OF CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITIES AB TWENTY EIGHTY THREE PROVIDES THE COURT WITH ADDITIONAL TOOLS BY INCREASING FINANCIAL PENALTIES FOR THOSE FOUND CRIMINALLY GUILTY FOR FIRES CAUSED BY THEIR FAILURE TO ABATE VEGETATION AROUND THE POWERLINES AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THE LEGISLATION IS NARROWLY FOCUSED TO SAY THAT IT HAS TO BE THE PRIMARY BECAUSE OF. THE NEGLIGENCE OF THE FAILURE TO OBEY IT HAS TO BE THE PRIMARY CAUSE WITH ME TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE VEIL IS FORMER CPUC COMMISSIONER PROFESSOR CATHERINE SANDOVAL AND BY PHONE WE HAVE ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY PAT COLLINS WITH THE NAPA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH AUDIBLE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. MY NAME IS KATHERINE SANDOVAL AND I'M A LAW PROFESSOR AT TEN AT TEN A CAR UNIVERSITY WHERE I'M A TENURED PROFESSOR. I TEACH ENERGY LAWS RULES COMMUNICATIONS LAW I'M A FORMER MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. AND I ALSO HAD THE HONOR OF REPRESENTING AS AND MAKE US PRO BONO. PG&amp;E RATEPAYERS IN P. GENIES FEDERAL CRIMINAL PROBATION- IS WHICH JUST CONCLUDED IN JANUARY. SO I AM HONORED TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF. AB TWENTY EIGHTY THREE AND THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR INTRODUCING IT. SO THIS BILL WOULD INCREASE. CRIMINAL PENALTIES ON UTILITIES THAT RECKLESSLY CAUSE WILDFIRES DUE TO CRIMINAL CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE AND WILLFUL NEGLECT OF VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. SO AS WAS MENTIONED THIS BILL IS NEEDED TO PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY. SAVE LIVES PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT AND ALSO FORESTALL CLIMATE CHANGE BECAUSE IT INCREASINGLY THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT WILDFIRES- PRODUCE TREMENDOUS- PARTICULATES WHICH ARE NOT ONLY HARMFUL TO HUMAN HEALTH BUT ALSO SPUR CLIMATE CHANGE. AND SELL THE CALIFORNIA HAS SUFFERED MANY UTILITY BECAUSE WILDFIRES INCLUDING WILDFIRES DURING P. GENIES CRIMINAL PROBATION. I SAID THE FIRST WHAT ROLE OF FEDERAL CRIMINAL PROBATION IS COMMITTED NO MORE CRIMES AND YET PG&amp;E REFUSED TO PLEAD GUILTY EVEN WHEN THEY WERE UNDER INDICTMENT FOR ADDITIONAL CRIMES DURING THEIR FEDERAL CRIMINAL PROBATION PG&amp;E WAS CONVICTED OF UNLAWFUL FIRE START WHICH IS PENAL CODE FOR FIFTY TWO WHICH IS ONE OF THE TRIGGERS IN THIS BILL AS WELL AS- EIGHTY FOUR COUNTS OF INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER FOR THE CAMPFIRE. PG&amp;E IS ALSO CURRENTLY UNDER INDICTMENT- IN CINEMA COUNTY FOR THE KINCAID FIRE AND IN SHASTA COUNTY FOR THOSE AUG FIRE AND SADLY IT FOR THIS LOG FIRE THEY'RE ALSO FOR ALLEGATIONS OF INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER DUE TO P. GENIES CONTACT. SO THIS BILL SEEKS TO DETER OF. CRIMINAL CONDUCT AND IT APPLIES PENALTIES AND ENHANCES THE PENALTIES TO CRIMINALLY RECKLESS CONDUCT. SO FOR ME I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND THE JURISDICTION OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION WHICH I'VE HAD THE HONOR OF SERVING ON. SO THE CPUC HAS NO POWER TO ENFORCE THE CRIMINAL LAW. THE CPSC ENFORCES THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES CODE AND ITS OWN RULES ORDERS AND DECISIONS. WITH THE CPUC DOESN'T CONDUCT CRIMINAL HEARINGS ITS JUDGES ARE NOT DESIGNED TO DO THAT IT'S EVIDENCE THAT- GATHERING IS NOT DESIGNED TO DO THAT THEY HAVE NO CRIMINAL ENFORCEMENT POWER. SO THIS BILL WOULD ONLY APPLY WHERE THERE HAS BEEN A CRIMINAL INDICTMENT AND CONVICTION. SO IT'S ALSO WORTH EMPHASIZING THE DIFFERENCE IN THE STANDARDS BETWEEN CRIMINAL LAW AND AT THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES CODE. SO FOUR CPUC VIOLATIONS THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT EVEN FOR FINDING OF NEGLIGENCE LET ALONE RECKLESSNESS AND NEVER REQUIREMENT FOR A FINDING OF CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE. ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN YOU LOOK AT CONVICTIONS FOR CALIFORNIA PENAL CODE FOR FIFTY TWO UNLAWFUL FIRE START TO BASICALLY UNINTENTIONAL ARSON. AND THERE IS A REQUIREMENT FOR CRIMINAL RECKLESSNESS TO BE FOUND TO HAS A WELL YES THANK YOU HAVE ANOTHER WITNESS TO THANK YOU- ALL CODES UP AS WELL AS A REQUIREMENT FOR CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE WITH REGARD TO THE PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE. SO IN CLOSING THIS BILL IS NOT DUPLICATIVE THERE ARE DIFFERENT TYPES OF LAWS BOTH CRIMINAL LAWS THAT APPLY TO ORDINARY PEOPLE AS WELL AS TO CORPORATIONS THAT CAUSE FIRES THROUGH CRIMINAL WANTON NECKLACE NEGLIGENCE. AND THIS IS A TARGETED INAPPROPRIATE BUILD THAT WOULD HELP TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA FROM CRIMINAL CONDUCT BY UTILITIES THANK YOU. I FOR MISC COLLINS BY TELL. TO DISTRICT ATTORNEY AT THE NAPA COUNTY. AT&amp;T OPERATOR. ONE MOMENT PLEASE WHILE LOCATOR LINE. WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE MISS COLLINS CONNECTED ON THAT ISLAND LIFE. OKAY WELL. GO AHEAD AND SEE IF YOU CAN FIND A WILL GO TO WITNESSES SUPPORT IN A ROW WITNESSES AND SUPPORT BETTER ON THE PHONE. EVERYONE CAN YOU- CAN YOU HEAR ME YES NAME AN ORGAN OKAY GREAT THANK- THIS IS PAT CALLING FROM A DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN THE NAPA COUNTY- ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION SECTION ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY THIS MORNING- I WANT TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. BECAUSE OF SOMETHING IMPORTANT GAP IN WELFARE PROTECTION AND ENFORCEMENT. IT HAD SIGNIFICANT FINES IN THE PRIMARY ACT OF RECKLESSNESS THE CAUSE OF THE FIRE IS A FAILURE TO CLEAR HOUSES TREES AND VEGETATION BROWN POWERFUL THE LINES. AND BEYOND ADDING APPROPRIATE PUNISHMENT FOR THE RECKLESSLY START FIRES. THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH FINES WILL ENCOURAGE COMPLIANCE WITH VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WHICH- WILL HELP PREVENT WILDFIRES AND FUTURE. I THINK THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM OF THIS BILL ATTEMPTS IN PART TO ADDRESS HIGHLIGHTED BY JUDGE ALSO TO COMMENT. ON THE EXPIRATION OF PG&amp;E PROBATION. AND STATED THAT WE REMAIN pPG&amp;E WILDFIRES BECAUSE FOR DECADES IT NEGLECTED ITS DUTIES CONCERNING HAZARDOUS TREE REMOVAL OF VEGETATION CLEARANCE. EVEN THOUGH SUCH DUTIES WERE REQUIRED BY THE PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE. IN TIMES TO COLLECT LEAD HAZARD TREES FALLING ON DISTRIBUTION LINES SPARKING WILDFIRES. DURING ITS CRIMINAL PROBATION ALL OR VIRTUALLY ALL THE WHILE FIRE STARTED BY PG&amp;E DISTRIBUTION LINES HAVE INVOLVED HAZARD TREES. I THINK THAT THE ACK OF ADEQUATE PENALTIES FOR CRIMINAL CONDUCT EXPLAINS AT LEAST IN PART. WHAT THE PROBLEM OF FAILURE TO CLEAR HAZARDOUS TREES AND VEGETATION HAS PERSISTED FOR SO LONG. CURRENTLY PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE SECTIONS. FOUR TWO NINE ZERO FOUR TWO NINE THREE ARE PUNISHABLE MISDEMEANORS THE MAXIMUM FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. A FELONY VIOLATION OF PENAL CODE SECTION FOUR FIVE TWO WHICH REQUIRES RECKLESS RECKLESSLY CAUSING A FIRE THAT BURNS INHABITED STRUCTURES OR CAUSES GREAT BODILY INJURY CARRIED A MAXIMUM FINE OF TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND THAT'S ALL THE PUNISHMENT TO GUILTY CORPORATION SUFFER BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GO TO JAIL. THANK YOU COULD LEAD TO CRIMINAL FIND ADDED BY THIS. YEAH I AM I'M DOING IT RIGHT NOW. OKAY SO IT ADDS. THE REFLECTS SERIOUSNESS THE CONDUCT IT WILL HELP. WITH DETERRENCE IT WILL HELP TO PREVENT WILDFIRES IN FUTURE. SO FOR THAT REASON WE ASK YOU TO PASS A BILL THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. AND ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AT&amp;T OPERATOR COULD YOU OPEN UP THE PHONE LINES. TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME LINE EIGHTY FOUR GO AHEAD. THANK YOU CAN PHONE STONE ADVOCATING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION THAT THE FUNDS ARE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. GET YOUR WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE AND YOU AT THIS TIME AND NOW WE LISTEN TO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. IN THE ROOM. AB BRANDON FEEDBACK FOR PG&amp;E N. ADAM SMITH SAID S. C. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. DURING THE PERSON GRAHA HELLO. THANK YOU CHAIR ADAM SMITH SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON RESPECTFULLY OPPOSING AB TWENTY EIGHTY THREE THIS BILL IGNORES THE AND UNNECESSARILY DUPLICATES EXISTING ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS AND AGGRESSIVE SAFETY COMMITMENTS AND ARE WHILE FOR MITIGATION PLAN IT ALSO DISREGARD SAFETY RELATED FINDS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS RECENTLY INCREASED WE BELIEVE THAT THE BILL ALSO UNDERCUTS THE SIGNIFICANT RECENT ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE TO STABILIZE THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF CALIFORNIA WESTERN UTILITIES. WE WOULD ARGUE THT THE EXISTING ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS ARE NOT BROKEN AB TWENTY THREE WOULD COMPLICATE AND DUPLICATE EXISTING UTILITY SAFETY ENFORCEMENT PROCESSES AND PENALTIES WHICH HAVE BEEN UTILIZED BY THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO ISSUE FINES INTO THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS P. JEANNIE WHO WILL SPEAK NEXT YOU COULD ASK THEM ABOUT THIS HAS RECENTLY BEEN FINED OVER TWO BILLION DOLLARS. TO SUGGEST IF AN INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY CAN BE FINED TWO BILLION DOLLARS THE INCENTIVES FOR COMPLIANCE WITH A UTILITY MEDICATION PLANS IS ALREADY THERE. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD. REMIND ITSELF AND TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THE RECENT SIGNIFICANT PENALTY INCREASES THAT WERE PASSED IN SB NINE A ONE. NO AFTER IF YOU TAKE A LOOK. AT SB NINE ONE PASSED BACK IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE INCREASE THE FINES FROM FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER OFFENSE. AND IF A VIOLATION IS OF A CONTINUING NATURE EACH DAY IS A SEPARATE AND DISTINCT DIFFERENCE WE THINK THAT FURTHER CRIMINALIZATION OF VEGETATION MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING THE CREATION OF MULTIPLE VENUES WHETHER IT'S THE COURTS AND NOT THE PC. FROM FORCING THE SAME OBLIGATIONS IS UNNECESSARY. AND FINALLY WE WOULD ARGUE THAT THE BILL UNDERMINES EXTENSIVE EFFORTS TO STABILIZE INVESTOR CONFIDENCE IN CALIFORNIA UTILITIES. AS WE SAID IN A BEFORE IN WERE UNDERMINING THE RECENT WILDFIRE PACKAGE. SB NINE A ONE AB TEN FIFTY FOUR WITH THIS BILL THE LEGISLATURE PASSES BILLS THE GOVERNOR SIGNED THEM. TO TRY TO ENCOURAGE THE UTILITIES FINANCIAL STABILITY AND VIABILITY IN THE FUTURE. BY PLACING EXCESSIVE UNNECESSARY PENALTIES ON UTILITY VEGETATION MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. THE STATE WOULD ONCE AGAIN PUT IOUS AT RISK OF LOSING INVESTOR CONFIDENCE AND AS WE KNOW THROUGH THE SB NINE A ONE MAYBE TEN FIFTY FOUR DISCUSSIONS. WHEN INVESTOR CONFIDENCE OUR ROADS. HAT LEADS TO RATE INCREASES FOR OUR CUSTOMERS IF TO THE COST OF BORROWING. INCREASE THOSE GET PASSED ON TO OUR CUSTOMERS WHEN WE DO GO OUT FOR WORK. SO WE THINK THAT THERE'S A STRONG ROBUST FRAMEWORK. EVERY INCENTIVE IN THE WORLD WHICH COULD INCLUDE YOU KNOW FINES UP TO INTO THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR THE UTILITIES DO THE RIGHT% THING TO PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY WE- APPLAUDED THE LEGISLATURES. IN A YOU KNOW. BILLS ENCOURAGING UTILITY ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT. WE SUPPORTED SB NINE OH ONE WE SUPPORT OF AB TEN FIFTY FOUR BUT WE OPPOSE THIS BILL TODAY AND WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO AS WELL. THANK YOU- SPREAD ANY BACK PACIFIC GAS LIKE THE AMERICAN I'M NOT FIRST TIME DOING THIS- WE AGREE WITH ALL THE CALLS WERE WITH THERE'S NO OF ABILITY HOLD US FINANCIAL FOR ANY OF OUR THURS NO SHORT OF ABILITIES TO COME AT CHARGERS WITH COLONEL CONNECTIONS- WE ARE SUBJECT ADVERSE COMBINATIONS OF ANY FIRE WE STARTED TO ANY LIABILITY THAT IS SOMETHING WE ARE CAPABLE FOR AND WE BELIEVE THAT VICTIMS SHOULD BE COMPENSATED DIRECTLY. THIS BILL DOESN'T QUITE DO THAT IT INCREASES FINES FOR CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS WHICH DON'T NECESSARILY GO DIRECTLY TO VICTIMS OR THE AT. ARMS FOR WHAT WE DO. WHEN WE PAY FOR COUNTIES REFUSE. THOSE PENALTIES ARE NOT RECOVERABLE REPAIRS ARE MORE STRICTLY BY SHAREHOLDERS. THOSE FINES ARE GENERALLY COMBINATION OF OFFSETS TO REPAIR CONTRIBUTIONS THEY'RE- USUALLY SOMETIMES DIRECTED INTO UPGRADE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH WE ARE ALL IN THE BENEFICIAL INTEREST OF. AND THERE'S ADDITIONAL- PAYMENTS BACK TO GENERAL FUND TO BENEFIT THE STATE FOR COSTS OF FIGHTING FIRES ONE THING I WOULD LIKE TO FLAG IS. THE PC HAS EXTENSIVE FINING AUTHORITY AS DISCUSSED BY ADAM BUT- THAT EXCLUSIVELY APPLIES TO PC REGULATED ENTITIES THE BILL BEFORE YOU WOULD LOOK AND PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE SECTION FORTY TWO NINETY TWO AND FORTY NINETY THREE. WHICH DON'T. WHICH DOESN'T JUST APPLY TO LOCAL CORPORATIONS PUBLIC UTILITIES. PRIVATE LINES INCLUDING THE- THE FIRE WAS STARTED BY PRIVATE INFRASTRUCTURE. TRAVEL GOVERNMENT'S REMOTE MICRO GRANTS PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES HOSPITALS COMMITTEE COLLEGES INDUSTRIAL ACTOR CUSTOMERS AND THE DEPARTMENT WATER RESOURCES. THEY ALL OF. MAINTAIN- OUT GOING FOR OVER SEVEN HUNDRED FOLD THAT WOULD BE. TO INCREASED CRIMINAL FIVE FOR. CORTICAL THE DEATH OF RECKLESS. ONLY INCLUDE. KNOWLEDGE AND A DECISION TO NOT TREAT IT. THERE ARE PLENTY OF REASONS- IN EXISTING LAW WITH REGULATION WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OF WHY WE CAN'T ALWAYS TREAT EVERY VEGETATION MANAGEMENT ISSUE WE ARE FACING WE HAVE. A BACKLOG OF EDUCATE MANAGERS WE ALL MET THAT WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER. TO ADDRESS THAT AS ADAM MENTIONED ANY TIME WE HAVE OUR- WORST CREDIT RATING IT JUST MEANS WE HAVE TO SPEND MORE CUSTOMER DOLLARS. TO GO OUT AND WORK ON THAT BACKLOG. BUT WE DO FACE ISSUES INCLUDING FOR ALAMEDA COUNTY THERE'S A LOT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- WHERE THEY WILL WITHHOLD THE CRUSHER PERMITS DUE TO OUR- WE HAVE A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WHERE THEY WOULD LIKE US TO RE PLANTED TREE EVERYWHERE WE CUT IT OUT OF TREES DUE TO ALAMEDA COUNTY ORDINANCE. HE IS THE AUTHORITIES PRETTY CLEAR THAT IT SUPERSEDES. THE GOVERNMENT BUT WE STILL CAN'T RECEIVING PRESSURE PERMITS FROM THE COUNTY. THOSE ISSUES ARE PERVASIVE ACROSS MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. WE FACE ISSUES FROM PRIVATE LANDOWNERS ENVIRONMENT ORGANIZATIONS THAT DISAGREE WITH OUR DETERMINATION IS TO CUT DOWN TREES. THE PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE SECTIONS ARE MINIMUM STANDARDS ANYTHING ABOVE THAT WE RELY ON. RESTER PRESSURE FORSTER'S ARBORISTS ACTUAL EXPERTS TO DETERMINE WHICH TREES WE SHOULD TREAT. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT PRODUCTION PROBABLY NOT BE LITIGATED IN CRIMINAL COURT- WE ALSO. EVEN STATUTE HAS A- CONFLICT WHERE WE ARE REQUIRED TO GO ON A PRIVATE PRIVATE LAND. WHERE REQUIRED WE ARE ALLOWED TO TRESPASS TO LAND BUT IF WE GO AHEAD AND CUT DOWN THE TREE OR TRIM THE TREE WITHOUT CONSENT OF PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNER THEY CAN SUE US FOR TRESPASS. AND FOR DAMAGES THE PROPERTY FOR THE VALUE TO TREAT THAT'S SOMETHING WE ARE SPONSORING A BILL TO. REMOVE ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL WOULD ONLY INCREASE OUR- CONTRACTORS INSURANCE AMOUNTS BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE FACING MORE LIABILITY BECAUSE THEY ARE ALSO HELD JOINTLY LIABLE WITH US WHENEVER THEIR WORK DOESN'T ACTUALLY ADDRESS THE ISSUE. WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OF CONTRACTING CREWS AS OUR FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS- SO I THINK IT'S SUMMARY WE WOULD ASK FOR A NO VOTE ON THIS BILL BECAUSE WE WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THE ACTUAL FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES OF WHY WE CAN'T. NECESSARILY ALWAYS COMPLY WITH OUR BUDGET MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS SOMETHING WE'RE COMMITTED TO IT SOMETHING WE PUT IN OUR WATER MITIGATION PLANS SOME WEIRD STRICTLY REGULATED BY. THE PC AND THE OFFICE OF ENERGY INSTRUCTOR SAFETY THAT'S RECENTLY ESTABLISHED AND WE ARE UNDERGROUNDING TEN THOUSAND MILES NEXT DECADE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO TO AVOID THE ENDLESS CYCLE BATCH MANAGEMENT. WHICH IF YOU COUNTRY INTEREST BACK WE ARE COMMITTED TO GETTING AWAY FROM THAT ISSUE BUT THAT'S NOT PRODUCTIVE WITH THIS BILL SO WE'D ASK FOR SUPPORT THAT. THANK YOU ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IN A ROW. HELLO NIKOLINA NONE THIS GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FIRST AND YOUR GAS AND ELECTRIC ALSO IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION THERE ON THE PHONE LINE. SPEAKING OPPOSITION PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. TWO GERMAN WE HAVE KNOWN QUEUED UP. J. THEN WILL BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR ANY QUESTIONS CAN MISTER CLARK- A TWO PAGE IN A OF WHO HAS THE BILL- DEALING WITH- ACCESS ACCESS TO TREES. IT'S ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR OKAY. THANK YOU HOW ARE I'LL TALK MY LIKE AUTHOR THAT WE NEED TO MAKE IT EASIER TO TAKE THE STREET DOWN THAT I'M ASHAMED THAT ALAMEDA COUNTY IS MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT- I THINK THAT IS THE APPROACH WE SHOULDTAKE. I HAVE BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE FOR TEN YEARS. AND I HAVE NOT VOTED FOR ANY BILLS THAT INCREASE PENALTIES. I VOTED FOR BILLS THAT WOULD MAKE IT EASIER TO CATCH THE BAD GUY TO REFORM THE BAD GUY- THAT'S MY PREFERRED APPROACH AND I'LL BE ASKING TO BECOME A CO AUTHOR AND BILL THANK YOU. IT WAS JUST HERE TO. THANK YOU- THERE ARE A FEW POINTS THAT WERE MADE THERE MALCOLM- ELABORATE ON- NUMBER ONE THE COSTS FOR THINGS LIKE THIS JUST GET PASSED ALONG TO CUSTOMERS WE'VE ALREADY BEEN HIT YES THEY DO THERE THERE ALONG EIGHT EIGHT AT THE END OF THE DAY IF THEY'RE COSTS EXCEED WHAT THEY'RE BEING ABLE TO CHARGE CUSTOMERS FOR- THEY GO TO THE P. YOU SEE AS YOU KNOW. AND AND THOSE FOLKS- WILL WILL PASS THOSE ELECTRIC RATES ALONG TO US- I'VE SEEN MY BILL INCREASE TEN FOLD SINCE THE LAST FEW YEARS- JUST DUE TO THE INCREASED COSTS FOR THE CHILES. THE BIGGER ISSUE HERE IS THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT- THE UTILITY COMPANIES DO NOT DO NOT CREATE AN OVER VEGETATION OF CALIFORNIA ARE LAWS DO OUR ENVIRONMENTAL LAW EFFORTS DO ALL OF THOSE DO. AND FOR US TO SAY THAT THEY ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR- D. IGNITION- YEAH OU KNOW THERE A LOT OF IGNITION SOURCES OUT THERE BUT WE DON'T SU MOTHER NATURE BECAUSE SHE SENDS DOWN A LIGHTNING STRIKE DURING A LIGHT DRY LIGHTNING STORM. AND A LOT OF FIRES ARE STARTED LIKE THAT. THE UNDERLYING CAUSE OF ALL OF IT IS OUR VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IN CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN NEGLECTED FOR A HUNDRED YEARS AND WE ARE WOEFULLY INADEQUATE AND CATCHING UP WITH THAT. AND WE HAVE CREATED BARRIERS TO PEOPLE INCLUDING THE UTILITY COMPANIES TO CLEARING THEIR BRUSH. IF IT'S PRIVATELY OWNED AS IT IS STATED BEFORE I CAN'T EVEN GET SOMEBODY WHEN I WAS DOING BRUSH CLEARANCE INSPECTIONS FOR THE COUNTY I COULDN'T GO ON PRIVATE PEOPLE'S PROPERTY ADD TO GO LOOK AT. FOR IT THEIR PROPERTY FROM ANOTHER HILL AND THEN SEND THEM A NOTICE SAY HEY YOU REALLY NEED TO TRIM THIS DOWN- BUT- YOU KNOW AT THE END OF THE DAY. WE HAVE LAWS THAT PROTECT PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNERS FROM HAVING. SOMEBODY ELSE COME ONTO THEIR PROPERTY AND REMOVE BRUSH. AND SO UNTIL WE ADDRESS THE BIGGER ISSUE WHICH IS OUR VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IN CALIFORNIA AND THE REGULATIONS AND LAWS THAT PREVENT US FROM DOING A BETTER JOB AT THAT WE CAN'T PINPOINT EVERYTHING ON. ON ONE WANTED ME TO UTILITY COMPANIES OR DID MANUFACTURERS OF BRAKES ON TRUCKS THAT PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD WITH HOT BREAKS AND LIGHT FIRES THAT WAY. OR MOTHER NATURE AND HER LIGHTNING STRIKES OR SOMEBODY'S IN THEIR BACKYARD WITH ELECTRIC GENERATOR OR SOMEBODY OUT DOING SOME BRUSH CLEARANCE WHO ACTUALLY HAD TO STONE WITH THEIR- BRUSH CLEARANCE MATERIAL AND CREATE TO SPARK WHICH SENDS OFF A FIRE. SO BRUSH CLEARANCE IS THE WARY WHAT HOWARD GO AND BRUSH MANAGEMENT AND- FEEL MANAGEMENT IS HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET OUT OF THIS. NOT BY CREATING MORE MECHANISMS TO OR THAT YOU HAVE COSTS THAT ARE PASSED ALONG TO WHO US THE RATEPAYERS. AND AND I JUST I THINK THERE IS ENOUGH- BOOTED OF MEASURES IN PLACE. WE'VE WE TALK OVER AND OVER ABOUT YOU KNOW THESE THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT- THEY'RE NOT EFFECTIVE. WHEN AND DOING MORE IS NOT GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE BUT THEN IN THIS SPACE WERE SAYING OH NO WE CAN DO MORE MORE IN IT SOMEHOW GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE. WHAT'S GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE IT'S GETTING A HANDLE ON OUR FUEL MANAGEMENT. AND WE'RE NOT DOING THE THINGS WE NEED TO DO. POLICY WISE AS A STATE AND AS A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO. TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A REAL IMPACT ON THIS WE NEED ELECTRICITY. WE'RE TRYING TO BE TOTALLY DEPENDENT ON LECTURE CITY. SO THE ONLY WAY TO LIMON EIGHT THAT IS TO ELIMINATE ELECTRICITY AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT. SO. MEASURES PROJECTED TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE BUT THAT'S THAT'S NOT THE PROBLEM THE PROBLEM IS YOU MANAGEMENT AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS. THE BILL MISTER BRIAN I. YES WE TALK A LOT ABOUT THE FACT THAT FINES AND FEES AN ADDITIONAL PENALTIES HARD BLACK BROWN POOR INDIGENOUS PEOPLE AND WE GET A LOT OF PUSH BACK FROM THE SAME FOLKS WHO USE THAT THEN LOGIC NOT TO APPLY TO CORPORATE UTILITY ENTITIES. AND THAT'S- THAT I'M DUMBFOUNDED- BY THAT ABILITY TO APPLY THAT LOGIC IN CERTAIN CASES AND NOT APPLIED IN OTHER CASES OF COURSE THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS WE NEED TO DO WITH BRUSH MANAGEMENT AND MAKING SURE- THAT FIRES AREN'T STARTED IN THAT WE CAN STILL HAVE SUCCESSFUL UTILITIES THAT DON'T INCREASE THE RATES ON INDIVIDUALS- ALL OF THAT IS IMPORTANT BUT I DON'T SEE THAT THIS BILL IS IN VIOLATION OF THAT- GIVEN THAT IT ONLY. ADDS ARE AUTHORIZES THIS FINE IF CONVICTED OF A MISDEMEANOR OR FELONY VIOLATION FOR STARTING A FIRE. WHICH IS A- WILDLY COMMON OCCURRENCE AND FAR TOO COMMON OCCURS AND SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS FOR THE DISCUSSION- I LIVE IN P. JEANNIE TERRITORY ON THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE. I DON'T SLEEP WHEN IT'S WINDY I SET UP WAITING. BECAUSE I KNOW THAT I'M AT RISK BECAUSE OF THE FAILURE TO MAINTAIN THESE LINES TO DO THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. AND YES OUR UTILITY RATES ARE TOO HIGH THERE TOO HIGH BECAUSE FOR TOO LONG UTILITIES BEEN PUTTING INVESTORS FIRST. AND NOT OUR STATE. AND ENOUGH IS ENOUGH WE DIDN'T NEED AN AUDIT THE AUDIT THE CAME OUT LAST WEEK TO TELL US THE WCT ISN'T DOING THEIR JOB. TO HOLD UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE BECAUSE WE SEE IT WHEN OUR STATE BURNS EVERY SINGLE YEAR AT THE HANDS OF UTILITIES. BUT NOW WE HAVE THE AUDIT TO TELL US WHAT WE ALREADY KNEW. AND SO IT IS INCUMBENT UPON US. TO DO WHAT IT TAKES TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE. SAFE FROM THE THREATS TODAY WHEN THE WIND BLOWS AND THEIR FAILURE STARTS A FIRE IN COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE. AND FROM THE FUTURE. BECAUSE YES THIS IS ONE OF THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTORS TO CLIMATE CHANGE RIGHT NOW. SO FOR NOW AND MY KIDS FUTURE WE NEED BE DOUBLING DOWN IN MAKING SURE THAT EVERY SINGLE FORM IN THIS STATE HAS THE ABILITY TO HOLD. THESE COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE AND YOU KNOW WHAT. WE THINK THIS A LOT IN THIS COMMITTEE I USED TO SIT ON THIS COMMITTEE. IF YOU'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING WRONG YOU'VE GOT NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. GO DO YOUR JOB. AND THEN THESE FINES WILL NEVER COME TO PASS. BUT THAT ASTRONOMICAL. THANK YOU IN IT THIS IS A- BUT A TOUGH ONE- AND IN FACT- I USED. GIVE ME THAT I HAD A LOT OF JOBS BEFORE I GOT THIS JOBBUT I USED TO BE DIRECTOR REAL ESTATE AND I JUST REMEMBER THE VEGETATION THAT. DEPARTMENT WATER POWER. NEEDED TO CLEAR. AND I REMEMBER ACTUARIAL. GOING THROUGH A SCENARIO OF. WHAT WOULD IT COST FOR A LAWSUIT VERSUS. DURING THE ACTUAL CLEANUP IN MANAGING THE VEGETATION AND READ WOULD HAVE LAWYERS AN ACTUARIAL SAY IT'S CHEAPER TO JUST NOT DO ANYTHING AT TAKE THE LAWSUIT. THEN BUT NOBODY EVER TALKED ABOUT THE LIFE STEP COULD BE LOST OR WHATNOT WE WOULD BANKRUPT DEPARTMENT WATER POWER AND IT JUST DROVE ME ABSOLUTELY CRAZY AS A- AS A PUBLIC SERVANT THAT THAT IS SOMETHING WE NEEDED TO DO. SO I GENUINE BELIEVE THAT WE NEED. TO RELAX REALLY MAKE UTILITY VEGETATION MANAGEMENT THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY. IS TO BE A PRIORITY NOT ONLY FOR UTILITIES COMPANIES. BUT IT SHOULD BE A PRIORITY FOR US AND DRIVES PEOPLE CRAZY EVEN IF IT MEANS WE NEED TO ALSO. FIGURE OUT A WAY TO PUT MONEY TOWARDS THAT BECAUSE IN THE IN THE BIG PICTURE IS- IT HURTS EVERYONE I WISH I WISH WE HAD MORE TIME TO WORK ON THIS I THINK WE COULD IF WE WERE TO TAKE THIS ON TO A NEW HOST UTILITIES IF I WERE TO GET OUT HERE. YOUR NEW NCM. BECAUSE IT DOES NEED MORE MORE DISCUSSION. IN THE AUTHOR NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE AN OPEN DIALOGUE. WITH THE WITH THE ENERGY COMPANIES- AND I THINK BECAUSE OF THE FIRES AND IF YOU'RE IN HI EVERYBODY WAS TRYING TO BLAME SOMEONE IT JUST GOT IT WE JUST I WAS HERE WHEN WE HAD THOSE DISCUSSIONS IT JUST NEVER GOT TO- WELL I THINK SO MEMBERS ON THIS COMMITTEE HAS SAID ACTUALLY CARE IN A PROBLEM. AND IN MAKING THAT AN EMPHASIS- INSTEAD OF JUST SAYING IT'S NOT MY JOB TO SOMEBODY ELSE'S JOB- WHEN IN FACT IT'S ALL OF OUR JOBS UP TO GET THIS DONE BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY- FREE LOSE ONE LIFE. BEHIND THIS IS JUST ONE LIFE TO ME AND THAT SHOULD BE THE GOAL SPECIAL ON WHEN HAVE US TALKING ABOUT BIG TERMS ALL THE TIME THIS S SOMETHING WE COULD WE COULD ACTUALLY WORK TOGETHER TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF VICTIMS- I WILL BE VOTING FOR TODAY AND IF WE WERE. TO MAKE IT THROUGH- I I'LL BE ACTED. WORKING WITH THE CHARITY TELL THESE- RESERVING MY VOTE IF IT MAKES IT TO THE FLOOR- ON WHAT I'M GOING TO DO BECAUSE THAT I MAY MAY NOT VOTE FOR IT WHEN IT GETS TO THE FLOOR BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE. ENOUGH IN NEAR ABOUT UTILITY VEGETATION MANAGEMENT I THINK THIS BILL COULD GET THERE HI HERE TO OTHER BILLS MOVING ALONG AND- AND MAY WE COULD COLLAPSE SIMILAR READ THEY NEED TO BE IN CONCERT WE SHOULD NOT BE DOING SEPARATELY. AND SO WITH THAT- I'VE MAKE THE MOTION. ON AB TWENTY EIGHTY THREE BY SEVEN MEMBER BARRICADE HAND THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE UTILITIES AND ENERGY COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER JONES SAWYER IRAQI BLACKIE NO BONTA. BRIAN BRIAN I WORK. QUIRK NO SANTIAGO SANTIAGO I SEYARTO NO SEYARTO NO PICTURES IT MEASURES UP NO DETAILS. THE FIVE VOTES TO GET IT OUT SANTA MONICA. BURKE SAID NO- CREDIT- SO THEN I MOVED FOR RECONSIDERATION SIR YES. THERE'S NO OBJECTION WILL BE GRANTED RECONSIDERATION BY UNANIMOUS CONSENT. I AM NOT ON THE COMMITTEE ANYMORE I FORGOT. IT'S STILL FIVE OF. JUST LAST MEMBERS I THINK GREAT MMHM YEAH- BUT IT STAYS THE SAME EVEN OVER SEVEN STATE THE NUMBER- OKAY WITH NUMBER NGUYEN AB TWENTY SIX FIFTY EIGHT ITEM NUMBER FOUR YOU'VE BEEN OUT ELECTRONIC MONITORING. SEVERAS TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR I HAVE THE WRONG NUMBER IN FRONT OF ME THANK YOU MISTER. I HAVE HELP. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF ON TO AB TWENTY SIX C. NINETY SEVEN NUMBER BECAUSE MANY GET WRONG AND AT PRESENTING A BILL THAT ENSURES- EQUITY FOR YOUTH IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM BY ALLOWING THEM TO RECEIVE CUSTODY CREDITS TOWARD THEIR SENTENCES WHEN PLACED ON ELECTRIC MONITORS A MONUMENTAL SHIFT IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM IS UNDER WAY AS WE ALL KNOW INSPIRED BY THE WIDE RECOGNITION THAT INCARCERATION IS NOT THE SOLUTION TO YOUTH CRIME. AS WE MOVE AWAY FROM INCARCERATION ELECTRONIC MONITORING HAS GAINED WIDESPREAD SUPPORT AS AN ALTERNATIVE FOR YOUTH OFFENDERS IN CALIFORNIA OVER 90% OF COUNTIES USES TECHNOLOGY APPROXIMATELY TEN THOUSAND YOUTH ARE PLACED ON ELECTRIC MONITORS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS HOWEVER UNLIKE ADULTS THESE YOUTH CAN REMAIN ON ANKLE MONITORS FOR MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS WITHOUT EARNING ANY CUSTODY CREDITS. OWNER REPEAT THAT THE JUVENILES ARE NOT GIVEN CREDIT BUT ADULTS ARE. CURRENTLY BY LAW JUDGES MAKE UP YOUTH ON ANKLE MONITORS AND PROBATION INDEFINITELY. THE UNMITIGATED USES OF ELECTRONIC MONITORING FOR LOVE RESULTS IN DETERIORATION IN MENTAL HEALTH PERSONAL WELL BEING AND RECIDIVISM. ELECTRONIC MONITORING ITS EFFECTS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT INFLICTED UPON YOU THE COLOR. THIS BILL WILL REMEDY THIS BY REQUIRING A JUDICIAL REVIEW FOR YOUTH PLACED ON ELECTRONIC MONITORS FOR PERIOD LONGER THAN THIRTY DAYS AB TWENTY SIX FIFTY EIGHT WILL ALSO REQUIRE LONG OVERDUE DATA COLLECTION TO MEASURE WHETHER ELECTRONIC MONITORS FURTHER REHABILITATIVE GOALS. SO WE ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH THE CHAIR ALWAYS ASKS FOR WHICH IS MORE DATA TO MAKE DECISIONS AROUND OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WORKS. TIME AND TIME AGAIN WE HEAR STORIES ABOUT YOUTH BEING CURSED RATED DUE TO TECHNICAL VIOLATIONS AB TWENTY SIX FIFTY EIGHT WILL PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED OVERSIGHT ON THE USAGE OF THESE ELECTRONIC MONITORS AND THIS PERPETUAL CYCLE. WITH ME TODAY AND SUPPORT OUR LAURA ARROYO PRESIDENT OF THE PACIFIC JUVENILE DEFENDER CENTER AND IT'S ALSO POLICY COORDINATOR AT FRESH LIFELINES FOR YOU I'M- SORRY. THANK YOU. IN MY SIXTEEN YEARS AS A PUBLIC DEFENDER IN ALAMEDA COUNTY I HANDLED EVERY TYPE OF CASE AND I'VE SEEN IT ALL. BUT LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT GOT TO ME THE MOST. I'VE ONLY CRIED IN COURT ON THE RECORD TWICE IN MY CAREER AND ONE OF THEM WAS SURROUNDING. THE INJUSTICE OF ELECTRONIC MONITORING AND YOUTH OF COLOR. I REPRESENTED A YOUNG MAN NAMED DARIAN WHO HAD STOLEN A PACKAGE FROM THE DOORSTEP. LIKE MANY AFRICAN AMERICAN YOUTH HE WAS NOT GIVEN A WARNING AND SENT HOME HE WAS HANDCUFFED AND TAKEN TO JUVENILE HALL. WHEN HE APPEARED IN COURT WITH ME BECAUSE HE APPEARED IN CUSTODY THE JUDGE WAS ONLY WILLING TO RELEASE HIM WITH AN ELECTRONIC MONITOR. WHEN HE APPEARED FOR PROGRESS REPORTS TO TAKE THE MONITOR OFF THE JUDGE WOULD ALWAYS FIND A REASON TO EXTEND THE TIME ON MONITORING. I DON'T LIKE YOUR ATTITUDE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MORE DAYS- JUST GET THE SEASON TO BEES THEN I'LL- CONSIDER TAKING YOU OFF OR- IF YOU WOULD JUST FOLLOW THE RULES PERFECTLY THEN I WOULD CONSIDER TAKING YOU OFF I'LL SEE YOU AGAIN IN SIXTY DAYS. AFTER TEN MONTHS OF BEING TOLD NO WE BOTH CRIED. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE RULES ARE NOT WRITTEN FOR THE ADOLESCENT BRAIN THEY DON'T ALLOW TEENAGERS TO GO OUT AND HANG OUT WITH THEIR FRIENDS OR GO PLAY BASKETBALL AT THE PARK. AND SO KIDS VIOLATE AND THEY ROTATE IN AND OUT OF CUSTODY EACH TIME MISSING SCHOOL AND GETTING FURTHER AND FURTHER BEHIND AND STARTING TO TAKE ON THE PERSONA AND THE IDENTITY AND THE STIGMA OF CRIMINAL. SOME SAY GPS OF ALL OF ITS PROBLEMS IS A IS BETTER THAN JAIL. BUT BETTER THAN JAIL IS A PRETTY LOW BAR WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT KIDS. THIS BILL WILL FIND WAYS TO CLEAN UP THE PROBLEMS WITH GPS TO MAKE IT A MORE PRECISE AND EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR YOUTH. FIRST IT WILL PROVIDE CUSTODY CREDITS CURRENTLY ADULTS GET TO CUSTODY CREDITS FOR EVERY DAY THERE ON THE MONITOR THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE THAT YOU'D GET ONE DAY OF CUSTODY CREDIT FOR EVERY DAY THERE ON THE MONITOR. SECOND IT WILL REQUIRE COURTS TO HOLD THIRTY DAY REVIEWS WHICH WILL ENCOURAGE COURTS TO EXPLORE OTHER OPTIONS SUCH AS MENTORS RATHER THE MONITORS. THIRD PREVENTING LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM RECORDING AN EAVESDROPPING CONVERSATIONS WILL PREVENT LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM LISTENING TO CONVERSATIONS THEY SHOULDN'T BE LISTENING TO. LIKE WHEN KIDS ARE TALKING TO THEIR PARENTS OR THEIR ATTORNEYS. AND FOURTH DATA COLLECTION WILL ALLOW US TO IDENTIFY PATTERNS OF DISCRIMINATION AND ALSO TO ASSESS WHETHER THE MONITORS ARE CAUSING POOR OUTCOMES FOR YOUTH. I URGE YOU TO VOTE HI I'M TWENTY SIX FIFTY EIGHT THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. YES NEXT. I GET AFTERNOON OR MORNING ALMOST AFTERNOON- MY NAME IS NIKOS JESS ON THE YOUTH VOICE POLICY CODE FOR FRESH I FUNDS FOR YOUTH- THE YOUTH SERVING ORGANIZATION IN THE BAY AREA WORKING WITH FORMERLY AND CURRENTLY. INCARCERATED YOUTH AND SYSTEM IMPACTED FOLKS- IN ADDITION TO BEING HERE ADVOCATING FOR THE YOUTH THAT I WORK WITH- ALSO HERE'S A FORMING CLOSER TO PERSON. WHO HAS BEEN A JUVENILE HALL AND ON HIM P. AS SOMEONE HAS BEEN ON EMP I CAN TELL YOU IT'S NOT CONDUCIVE TO REHABILITATION- AND IS NOT AN ALTERNATIVE TO INCARCERATION BUT JUST ANOTHER FORM OF INCARCERATION. INSTEAD OF BEING LOCKED UP IN A JUVENILE HALL YOU'RE NOT LOCKED UP INSIDE OF YOUR HOME- THE ARBITRARY RULES THAT THEY ARE PLACED ON YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ARE ON EMP ALLOW FOR. YOUNG FOLKS TO GO THROUGH CYCLES OF INCARCERATION WHERE THEY'RE THEY'RE ON EMP FOR LET'S SAY. THERE THE DAY THEY START OFF AT NINETY DAYS ON EMP THEY VIOLATE THEY GO INSIDE JUVENILE HALL THEY COME BACK OUT AND THEY CONTINUE THE CYCLE WHICH- WAS SUPPOSED TO BE NINETY DAYS AND IT TURNS INTO A YEAR- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT SEEN FROM THE PANDEMIC AS ADULTS RIGHT LIKE WE'VE WE'VE ALL HAD A HARD TIME BEING IN OUR HOMES- IT'S BEEN HARD FROM FOREST BE ISOLATED FROM MY FRIENDS FROM MY FAMILY TO BE AWAY FROM THE THINGS THAT THAT MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES HOLE. BY- AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO BOOT TO REMEMBER THAT A LOT OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ARE ON HIM P. ARE PROBABLY NOT LIVING IN IN THE HOMES THAT ARE IS NICE IS ALL OF YOURS RIGHT- THIS GAVE FROM THE HOME IS SOMETIMES THE- THE ONLY A SKATED THEY HAVE FROM ABUSIVE SITUATIONS- FROM NEGLECT. MAYBE IT'S THE ONLY FORM OF ENTERTAINMENT I- IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO TREAT KIDS LIKE KIDS AND GIVE THEM OPPORTUNITIES. AND I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO GIVE YOUNG PEOPLE THE SAME RIGHTS TAT ADULTS HAVE RIGHT. THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET TIME SERVED CREDIT FOR BEING ON EMP- THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO. BE PROVIDED WITH THE BEST POSSIBLE CARE. ON THE DESERVE OPPORTUNITY TO EXIT THE PUNITIVE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND CONTINUE WITH THEIR LIVES- SO I URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON AB TWENTY SIX FIFTY EIGHT.

LOOKING FOR YOU'RE LOOKING BACK ON MAKING SURE THE WITNESS SPOKE WITH HIS BEEN ON SINCE ABOUT NINE THIS MORNING SO WE'RE OKAY SAID IF THE LAW- I THE WAY. PHIL CONTROVERSY. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR I AM MEMBERS I RISE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY FOR A BILL THAT WOULD CREATE A PILOT PROGRAM TO PROVIDE SERVICES FOR SURVIVORS OF CRIME. THAT IS AUTONOMOUS FROM LONG FIRST FORSMAN. CURRENTLY SURPRISE A CRIME MAY RECEIVE VICTIM SERVICES RESOURCES LIKE. CRIME RELATED CRISIS COUNTY EMERGENCY SERVICES ASSISTANCE WITH RESTITUTION COMPENSATION CLAIMS BUT ONLY IF THEY COOPERATE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND IN MANY INSTANCES THAT MEANS OPENING A CASE AGAINST THE DEFENDANT. THE PROBLEM WITH THIS CURRENT SYSTEM IS THAT TYING THE SERVICES FOR SURVIVORS OF CRIME TO CONTACT WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN BE A DAUNTING BARRIER FOR PEOPLE STRUGGLING WITH TRAUMA. IN FACT LESS THAN A THIRD OF CRIME SURVIVORS REPORTED RECEIVING HELP. ONE RECENT SURVEY BY THE NATIONAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HOTLINE REVEALED THAT REPORTED FEELING SOMEWHAT OR EXTREMELY AFRAID TO CALL THE POLICE. AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY FOUR CREATE A PILOT PROGRAM IN FIVE COUNTIES INCLUDING LOS ANGELES AND ALAMEDA COUNTY. TO PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES TO ALL SURVIVORS OF CRIME. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY'RE WILLING TO OPEN A CASE THAT MAY EXPOSE THEMSELVES OR THEIR LOVED ONES TO PROSECUTION OF CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION. COUNTY SHOWS ALMOST ALISON OFFICE OF SURVIVOR SUPPORT HARM REDUCTION THAT IS INDEPENDENT AND AUTONOMOUS FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THE OFFICE WILL ACCEPT WALKEN'S. SELF REFERRALS ARE FROZEN COURTS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS SCHOOL SMALL BUSINESSES PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE PROSECUTORS LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. AND OTHERS. THESE OFFICES WILL SAYS SURVIVORS NEED TO PROVIDE SERVICES INCLUDING HEALTH SERVICES AS WELL AS HEALING SUPPORT FOR INDIVIDUALS EXPOSED TO VIOLENCE ABUSE. OR HARMFUL INTERACTIONS. IT WILL ALSO PROVIDE HOUSING RESOURCES SERVICES AND SUPPORT FOR VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS INCLUDING PROCESSING CLAIMS WITH THE STATE'S VICTIMS COMPENSATION FUND. YOU LIVE IN THESE SERVICES ARE CRITICAL. SURVIVORS ARE VULNERABLE IN SEEKING RESOURCES JOINED BY TRACY STAFFORD A FORMER SPOKESPERSON FOR THE CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP TO END DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND DARCIE GREEN FROM THE ESSIE JUSTICE GROUP. BOTH BY PHONE BY EIGHTEEN T. OPERATOR COULD YOU BRING. ME STAFFORD AND- MS GREEN IN. LUCIO DARCY GREEN AND YOUR LINE IS OPEN. THE SCREEN YOU MAY BEGIN. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DOROTHY GREEN AND I AM AND AS HE JUST DISCRIMINATORY AND LEADER AS HE DOESN'T GIVE THE NATIONAL NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT HARNESSES THE COLLECTIVE POWER OF WOMEN AND GENDER NONCONFORMING PEOPLE BUT INCARCERATED LOVED ONES TO END MASS INCARCERATION HARM TO WOMEN AND COMMUNITIES AND WE ARE PROUD SPONSORS OF AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY FOR THE PART OF THE CARE FOR COLLISION CALIFORNIA COLLISION. WE ARE ONE OF THE WOMEN AND THE ONE INCH BLACK WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN INCARCERATED BOB WHAT. I SURVIVORS DOMESTIC BY. TWO WASN'T ABLE TO ACCESS ANY VICTIMS. SERVICES BE SELECTED BECAUSE OF THE ACTIONS OF THE POLICE. I KNOW FIRST HAND BUT YOUR SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY FOUR IS CRUCIAL TO ENSURING THAT COMMON FORMS TO BUY THEIR SERVICES ARE MADE COMPLETELY ACCEPTABLE TO ALL. UNFORTUNATELY THE POLICE CONTRIBUTED TO THE VIOLENCE I EXPERIENCED. OUR NOT A VIABLE RESOURCE YOU NEED BECAUSE OF THEIR ACTIONS THAT DAY. IN FACT THEY WERE DIRECTOR YOUR KEY EXPECTING VICTIM SERVICES. AND I WASN'T THE PERSON WHO CONTACTED THE POLICE AND THE POLICE ASK NO QUESTIONS AT THE SCENE I WAS INCORRECT READING THE PERSON TO CAUSE HARM. THANKFULLY AFTER GETTING THE FACT TO MY ATTORNEY. THE DA DID NOT PICK UP MY KIDS. BUT THAT ALSO MEANT THERE WAS NO WAY FOR ME TO FORMALLY REVIEW THAT I WAS THE PERPETRATOR SH AND IT WASN'T UNTIL SIX MONTHS LATER IN FAMILY COURT WHERE I WAS FIGHTING FOR CUSTODY OF MY SON. THAT I WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE AT THE TICKET IN MY CASE. DURING THOSE SIX MONTHS. I WAS INELIGIBLE TO ACCESS MANY OF THE TRADITIONAL ROUTE. THAT SERVICES. PROVIDER SERVICES BECAUSE OF THE STRICT RULES OF SOME COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. AND TWENTIETH OFFICES THAT HAVE. TO HAVE AROUND SERVING ONLY THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN FORMALLY TRAINED AS VICTOR MONTHLY SUPPORT DURING COURT. HAVING ACCESS TO ANY. SURVIVORS SUPPORT SERVICES WOULD HAVE REDUCE THE PAIN AND SUFFERING I EXPERIENCED. I HAD TO NAVIGATE MY SITUATION WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF TRADITIONAL VICTIM SERVICES. FOR LEGAL GOVERNMENT. SYSTEM THAT COULD HAVE HELPED ME. I HAD I BEEN. TO ADD. THE SERVICES IN THE- A LOT FOURTH IT WOULD SAVED ME FORTY. DOLLARS I. WHEN COMPANIES OF BAIL ATTORNEY. AND OTHER NEEDS TO THE STATE OF MY FAMILY MYSELF THOUGHT. I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T BEEN AT. HAD I HAD A BILL LIKE IN PLACE. DURING THE PROCESS OF SEEKING SURVIVORS QUICKER THE YOU TEND TO THINK. THAT IF YOU'RE NOT L. TO RECEIVE THESE SERVICES. AND MAYBE NO ONE CARES. YOU START TO THINK THAT MAYBE NO ONE CARES ABOUT THE ABOUT HEALING TRAUMA OR SUPPORTING SURVIVORS. AND THERE IS THERE'S A FEELING THAT IF YOU DON'T THAT THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA THAT EXIST MAYBE YOU DON'T BELONG. HE STARTED TELLING ME TO INCREASE ISOLATION BILLION LIKE YOU'RE A DIFFERENT CLASS OF SURVIVOR AND THAT YOUR EXPERIENCE YOUR TRAUMA IN YOUR TEEN. MAY BE DENIED OR INVALIDATED BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE PROOF OF THE PROOF THAT IT OCCURRED. AND UNFORTUNATELY MY CASE IS NOWHERE NEAR YOU. A LARGE NUMBER OF WOMEN WITH INCARCERATED LOVED ONES AND WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN SYSTEM IMPACTED ARE ALSO VICTIMS OF HARM. EITHER NOT BINARY IDENTITIES. THE NUMBER OF THEM THE NUMBER INCREASES EVEN MORE FOR INCARCERATED WOMEN WITH A VAST MAJORITY HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE PRIOR TO THEIR INCARCERATION. INCLUDING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RAPE. SEXUAL ASSAULT AND CHILD ABUSE. THE WAITER WHICH WOMEN ARE EXPERIENCING HARMON VIOLENCE WHILE ALSO EXPERIENCING STATE VIOLENCE DOING KERR GETTING CRACKED REYES NICARAGUAN. RESULT IN INCREASED ISOLATION ECONOMIC DEVASTATION AND HEIGHTENED EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL TRAUMA. AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY FOUR WOULD REMOVE THE BARRIERS I THINK IN ACCESSING SERVICES BY ESTABLISHING PILOT PROGRAMS IN FIVE COUNTY. STATE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES TO ALL SURVIVORS INDEPENDENT ALONG FORTUNATE. BUT MY KIDS SPECIFICALLY THIS WOULD HAVE CHANGED EVERYTHING I WOULD NOT HAVE THAT MADE A DECISION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT I SHOULD BE CREDITED FOR MYSELF. ARE CRIMINALIZED. MIGHT AND FORMERLY INCARCERATED LOVED ONE. I AM NOT ALONE IN THE INTERNAL CONFLICT EXPERIENCED. AND HAVING TO MAKE THAT DECISION. 80% OF SURVIVORS REPORT FEELING SOMEWHAT WORK SHE NEEDS FOR YOU TO CALL THE POLICE. STATION I KNOW I CERTAINLY BUT- MORE SPECIFICALLY WOMEN WITH INCARCERATED LOVED ONES ESPECIALLY WOMEN OF COLOR. YOU KNOW THE HARM POLICE INVOLVEMENT BECAUSE THIS TO OURSELVES AND OUR FAMILIES. INCLUDING AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY FOUR WITH ESTABLISH A FOUNDATION. FOR HOW TO ADDRESS HARMON VIOLENCE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. THAT RESPOND BY NEEDING PEOPLE'S NEEDS INSTEAD OF RESPONDING TO THE THREE MINUTES AGO. OR DOING CORPORATION. I URGE YOUR VOTE IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY FOUR. PLEASE HELP US TO TRANSFORM THE LIVES AND EXPERIENCES OF ALL SURVIVORS THANK YOU. FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. HAT'S WHAT THE- AFTER. YES HELLO GOOD ACT. OUR BRAINS TRYING TO STAFFORD AND JOB I HAVE TO BUY CHILD ABUSE SEXUAL ASSAULT AND I'M ALSO A THIRD GENERATION DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVOR I TRAVELED TO OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE THE TIME THAT THE FOLKS PERCENT FOR THE CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP ENDED VIOLENCE AND HAVE WORKED WITH THE US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE OFFICE ON VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND I'VE ALSO- WORKED QUITE A BIT WITH THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON THE PROSECUTION OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. I PROVIDED DIRECT ASSISTANCE TO NEARLY IMPACTED- DETERMINES AS WELL AS THOSE ON PAROLE AND BE INCARCERATED I THEREFORE I DEFINITELY. HAVE A FIRST HAND. I IT'S CLEAR WHEN YOU STAND. DESPERATELY FOR COMP VICTIMS AFTER DECADES AND I'VE CREATED LEGISLATORS WITH PROSECUTORS AND ADVOCATES. SHOULD FOCUS ON THE TRUTH AND THAT THE TRUTH THAT VICTIMS AND PERPETRATORS ARE OFTEN WEDNESDAY. MIGHT WORK WITH INMATES I REALIZE THAT MOST HAD A VERY SIMILAR STORY TO MY OWN- WE HAVE A DISTORTED- BURST IN OUR VIEW OF HUMAN INTERACTION- I REALITY- WITHIN WHICH IS GREAT PAINT OUR OWN SPARE. AND PTSD WERE PRETTY MUCH- NORMALIZED IN MY LIFE AND THAT THAT THAT MANY OTHERS- THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE CONTINUES TO GROW GENERATION. AFTER GENERATION. A CALL TO OUR PROPERTY NOT IN A TWO FIVE THIRTY AGAIN TO IN THIS BY. QUICKER BY X. AND SUSTAINABLE TRY INFORM SERVICES. WITHIN A NEW. IN BY WHICH IS KEY ARE A DIFFERENT. THE FACT THAT POLICE INTERVENTION CAN BE A BARRIER TO ACCESSING NEEDED SERVICES AND ACTUALLY ADD TO THE TURMOIL AT THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER MENTIONED. AND IN MY CASE- BEING A BLACK WOMAN AND- IT WAS REALLY JUST BOUGHT THAT I WOULD CALL THE POLICE ON A BLACK MANAGE THAT. ALMOST COST ME MY LIFE. AND I WILL. CLOSE BY JUST SAYING YOU KNOW WHEN I ESCAPED. THAT A DECENT RELATIONSHIP ALL I WANTED WAS BETTER FOR MY DAUGHTER I DIDN'T WANT TO DEAL WITH COOLEY I DIDN'T WANT TO DEAL WITH COURT I DO TWENTY THREE XP THEY SHOULD HAVE MY DAUGHTER BE SAFE. I REMEMBER LOOKING INTO HER EYES YOU KNOW AGAIN THREE YEAR OLD AS SHE WATCHED THE ABUSE THAT I WAS SUFFERING. AND IN HER FACE I SAW. WHAT LOOKED LIKE ANNOYANCE RATHER THAN FEAR. AND SHE WAS WATCHING HE WITH ME BASICALLY ME WATCHING MY MOTHER BE BEATEN SHE WAS MY MOTHER WATCHING MY GRANDMOTHER BE ABUSE. NO IN THAT MOMENT I DECIDED THAT THIS COULD NOT BE YOU KNOW HER NORMAL BUT I WAS NOT GOING TO TREAT CONTINUE THAT CYCLE AND ACTUALLY HE'S NOW THIRTY FOUR AND WE BROKE INTO IT AND- THAT OF MY DAUGHTERS HAVE EXPERIENCED IT TO THIS POINT. AND AND ASKING THAT YOU HELP US TO TRANSFORM THE LIVES OF THOSE WHO HAD BEEN HELD CAPTIVE BY GENERATIONAL TRAUMA AS WELL AS THE VICTIMS. THAT ARE BEHIND BARS SO PLEASE SUPPORT AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY FOUR FOR ALL VICTIMS THANK YOU. ARE THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE IN THE ROOM ED IN SUPPORT. NAME AN ORGANIZATION.

LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY FOUR PLEASE PRESS ONE AND ZERO AT THIS TIME. MISTER CHAIR THERE'S NO ONE COMING UP AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU WILL BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS. PLEASE BONTA THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I THINK IT'S A VERY GOOD DEMONSTRATION OF WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE A PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH TO ENSURING THAT OUR SURVIVORS GET THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED AND- AND I'M THANKFUL TO BE CO AUTHOR WITH THE ON. THANK YOU ANY MISTER LUCKY. YEAH I. I HAVE TO UNFORTUNATELY NOT BE IN A POSITION OF SUPPORT ON THIS PARTICULAR APPROACH TO- IDENTIFIED PROBLEMS I BELIEVE THAT THE VICTIMS COMPENSATION FUND IS ALREADY IN. JEOPARDY OF INSOLVENCY. AND EXPANDING THE DEFINITION OF VICTIMS. IS EXTREMELY PROBLEMATIC I DON'T THINK THAT MOST PEOPLE WHEN I THINK OF VICTIMS WOULD. WOULD LIKE TO HOUSING FOR SEX WORKERS AS A COMPENSATION. FOR VICTIMHOOD I GET A FEELING TO THAT AS YOU DESCRIBED THE NEED FOR THIS BILL THAT IT'S- THE ANTI LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND I THINK WE NEED TO BUILD THAT TRUST NOT A ROAD AND THIS SEEMS LIKE IT'S- MOVING INTHE WRONG DIRECTION SO I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT. THANK YOU- YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU- APPRECIATE ALL THE COMMENTS I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY VICTIMS OF TRAUMA AND VIOLENCE- I'VE COME ACROSS WHO WERE UNABLE TO RECEIVE SERVICES ARE. AS A TOOL OF LEVERAGE FOR PROSECUTORS TO GET CONVICTIONS IS HARMFUL TO VICTIMS. AND I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR US TO EXPAND THE DEFINITION OF VICTIM TO ANYBODY WHO'S HARMED BY VIOLENCE OR TRAUMA- THE IDEA THAT THE VICTIMS COMPENSATION FUND- MAYBE BECOMING INSOLVENT MIGHT BE A QUESTION ABOUT A BUDGETARY PRIORITIES. WHICH I'M HAPPY TO EXPLORE- WITH THE VICE CHAIR AS WELL. BUT THIS PILOT PROGRAM I THINK IT'S SMART IT'S REASONABLE- IT ADDRESSES A MAJOR CONCERN THAT PEOPLE HAVE WHEN SEEKING OUT HELP. IT'S TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE CAN I GET HELP WITHOUT FURTHER TRUMP POSITION AND STIGMATIZATION AND RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES UNTIL PILOTING THIS AND FIVE. COUNTS GATHERING DATA NEXT THE EFFICACY THIS WAS SURVIVORS ARE CALLING ON US TO DO WITH WHAT THEY'VE CALLED MY OFFICE TO DO AND I'M PROUD OFF OF THIS BILL AND RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU AND WE DO NEED TO TRY OF. HAVE A MEDICAL. SERVICES APPROACH RIGHT I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BORCHERS RECOMMENDED I. IS THERE A MOTION HELLO ON AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY FOUR BY SEVEN MEMBER BRIAN THE MISSION IS TO PASS TO THE HEALTH COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER HI JONES SAWYER IRAQI LACKEY NO BONTA BONTA HI BRIAN BRIAN I. WORK SANTIAGO THEY ARE TO LOOK AT MEASURES ON CALL. SHORTER OUR LAST TWO H. MR MCCARTY INVESTORS DOWN I HAVE MISTER MCCARTY FIRST MUCH YOU NEED TO BE SOMEWHERE MISTER STONE AS CHAIR GEN. OKAY MISTER CAR IS GRACIOUS ALLOWING YOU TO GO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IN THIS MCCARTY. REYES SO AB TWENTY SIX FIFTY SEVEN ADDRESSES FOLKS WHO ARE ON DEATH ROW WHO ARE CRIMINALLY INCOMPETENT THE SUPREME COURT. ESTABLISHED THAT THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT PROHIBITS THE EXECUTION OF PEOPLE WHO ARE MENTALLY INCOMPETENT AND AS THE POPULATION ON DEATH ROW AGES AND CIRCUMSTANCES HAPPENING IN PRISON THERE ARE MORE AND MORE FOLKS WHO ARE. DETERMINE TO BE PERMANENTLY INCOMPETENT AND WOULD THEREFORE BE PREVENTED BY THE CONSTITUTION FROM EVER BEING EXECUTED BUT YET THEY SIT ON DEATH ROW THERE'S NO STATUTORY MECHANISM TO REMOVE FOLKS FROM DEATH ROW AS THEY REALLY SHOULD BE. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT IS HUMANE FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN A SITUATION. THAT IS BEYOND THEIR COMPREHENSION THAT COULD NOT BE EXCUSE SHOULD NOT BE ON DEATH ROW AND IT IS FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE AS IT IS INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE TO HOLD PEOPLE UNNECESSARILY ON DEATH ROW. AS WE ARE WORKING TO. HOPEFULLY IN MY VIEW THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS DOES BUT GET RID OF THE DEATH PENALTY IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S NOT REALLY THIS BUT THIS IS. TRYING TO MINIMIZE THE POPULATION ESPECIALLY POPULATION. WHO SHOULD NOT BE THERE AND ACROSS IN THE STATE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY. SO THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES- I AM HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES. AMENDMENTS AND I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE YEAH WITH YOUR COMMITTEE WITH YOUR STAFF RESEARCHER WITH THAT I ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. AND I DO HAVE TWO WITNESSES ASSISTED FEDERAL DEFENDER DEFENDER HARRY SIMON I BELIEVE IS ON THE TELEPHONE AND THEN WITH ME HERE IS NATASHA MINSKER. WHO WILL ALSO. I GUESS ANSWER QUESTIONS IF NECESSARY. OKAY OKAY ASTRONOVA THANK YOU THANK YOU SO I GUESS WE'LL GO TO THE WITNESS ON THE PHONE FIRST. THANK YOU- MEMBERS ARE COMMITTED YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TIME AND- THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL TWO SIX FIVE SEVEN. I AM AN ATTORNEY REPRESENTING PEOPLE SENTENCED TO DEATH IN CALIFORNIA AND I REPRESENTED SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS. WHO ARE PROFOUNDLY MENTALLY ILL IN CONNECTION WITH CLAIMS THAT THIS LEGISLATION WOULD ADDRESS. THAT PART OF ITS DEFINITELY REPORT THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE ON REVISION OF THE PENAL CODE RECOGNIZE THAT THEIR PEOPLE ON DEATH ROW. INTELLECTUAL FUNCTIONING OR PSYCHOLOGICAL CONDITIONS. RATED COUPLED FROM. SUCH AS FROM AIDS RELATED DEMENTIA DURING THEIR INCARCERATION. THEY HAVE LITTLE LIKELIHOOD OF GAINING COMPETENCY. THEY RECOMMENDED THAT THE LEGISLATURE MODIFYING THE EXISTING STATURE REGARDING COMPETENCY PROCEEDING. TO CREATE A CLEAR PROCESS RETURNS THESE PERMANENTLY INCOMPETENT PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY CANNOT BE LEGALLY EXECUTED. PENAL CODE SECTION THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED AND FALLING RESOLVED THE ISSUE OF WHETHER PEOPLE COME TO DEATH ARE MENTALLY INCOMPETENT ON THE EVE OF EXECUTION THESE STATUTES WERE LAST REVISED IN NINETEEN FORTY ONE. KERN THE CALIFORNIA'S NEAR THE U. S. SUPREME COURT HAS ISSUED OPINIONS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX AND CORD PERSONAL LINE RIGHT. AND AGAIN IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN INFINITI PERSONAL PORTMAN SETTING COURTS CLUBS AND HAVE BEEN PROCEDURAL PROTECTIONS AGAINST ACCUSED A MAN LAYING COMMON PEOPLE UNDER THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT. THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO PULL FIRST IT MODERNIZE IN CALIFORNIA LAW CAN WARM WITH. MODERN FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL. SECOND IT. AUTHORIZED THE CALIFORNIA COURT. TO ACT IN A TIMELY. AREN'T UP BRO FROM INCOMPETENT AND FOR THAT REASON NEVER BE A GOOD. THE U. S. SUPREME COURT INCLUDED IT IS ON. KILOGRAM IN. THE LAW OF ONE WHO MENTAL L. PREVENTED CALM THE REASONS FOR THE DEATH PENALTY OR THE IMPLICATIONS BANKAMERICARD MORE THAN AWARENESS OF THE STATE. REASONS FOR AN EXECUTION THE PERSON THE STATE INTENDS TO PUT TO DEATH ALSO HAVE TO HAVE A RATIONAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACT OF THEIR EXECUTION AND THE REASONS FOR. WHAT DO. OUR LOWS WITH MODERNIZE PEOPLE SECTION THIRTY SEVEN POINT FIVE AND FALLING TO CONFORM TO THE REQUIREMENTS THE U. S. CONSTITUTION BUT IT WOULD ALSO PROVIDE EXPLICIT AUTHORIZATION FOR CALIFORNIA COURTS TO CONSIDER PETITIONS RAISING CLAIMS OF PERMANENT INCOMPETENT TO BE EXECUTED IN ADVANCE OF THE DAY THE NEXT WEEK USE NO CONTRAST. AS THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL'S NEPOTIC REPEATEDLY IN LITIGATION OVER THIS ISSUE. COMPELLING REASON TO EXIST FOR REACHING A CLAIM A PERMANENT INCOMPETENCE SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. FOR A PRISONER CAN NEVER BE EXECUTED. THEN ALL OTHER TECH KNOWLEDGE IS THE DE PENALTY ARE MEANT. AND ANY JUDICIAL INQUIRY INTO THE VALIDITY OF THOSE OTHER CHALLENGES WOULD BE POINTLESS. ENACTMENT OF THIS LEGISLATION WOULD PREVENT FUTURE OBLIGATION OF. CONVICTION PROCEEDINGS IN CAPITAL CASE APPEALS MAY BE A CASE- IN STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS WHEN A PERSON SENTENCED TO DEATH. BECOME PERMANENTLY IN COP AND IT WOULD SAVE THE CALIFORNIA FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SIGNIFICANT PHAM IS DEVOTED TO SUCH POINTLESS LITIGATION. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES DID YOU ARE YOU LOOKING AT RIGHT GOOD AFTERNOON ATTACHMENTS FOR HERE FOR CALIFORNIA'S ANTI DEFINITELY COALITION I JUST WANNA MAKE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT THIS BILL DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THESE INDIVIDUALS WILL BE EXECUTED BECAUSE IT'S ABSOLUTELY CLEAR UNDER CURRENT LAW THAT THEY CANNOT BE EXECUTED THE BILL ALSO DOESN'T CHANGE THEIR HOUSING SITUATION BECAUSE THESE FOLKS ARE HOUSED IN SECURE CDCR MEDICAL FACILITIES AND THAT IS WHERE THEY WILL DIE. AND FINALLY THE BILL DOESN'T IMPACT THEIR AWARENESS OF THEIR SENTENCE BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW THEY'VE BEEN SENTENCED TO DEATH OR THE REASONS WHY OR EVEN WHAT IT MEANS TO BE EXECUTED THAT'S THE VERY DEFINITION OF BEING INCOMPETENT FOR EXECUTION THIS BILL SIMPLY ADDRESSES THE ABSURDITY THAT WE KEEPPEOPLE ON DEATH ROW WHO HAVE SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND ADVANCED DEMENTIA TO THE POINT THAT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT DAY IT IS OR WHAT YEAR IT IS OR WHERE THEY ARE. AND IT WILL PUT TO THE END THE CURRENTLY ENDLESS LITIGATION IN THESE CASES ALLOWING US TO DIVERT THOSE RESOURCES TO BETTER USE WAS THAT ACTUALLY IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY WE ASK FOR YOUR I.

AND HOW THEY KNOW THIS HAPPENED BECAUSE THEY WITNESSED HIM BUYING IT AT A GUN SHOW. WITHOUT PROPER OVERSIGHT OF THAT SO THIS BILL WOULD I THINK PUTS SOME REASONABLE REGULATIONS ON GUN SHOWS NOT TO SHUT THEM DOWN. JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE PROPER- SIGNAGE AND INFORMATION OUT FRONT TO KNOWING WHAT THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE IN THE EXPECTATIONS FOR BUYERS. AND- AND SELLERS AND CAN ALSO FOCUS ON THAT ONE ROUGHLY ONE HUNDRED GUN SHOWS THAT OCCUR EVERY YEAR IN CALIFORNIA. THAT THE GUN SHOW- PRODUCERS AND VENDORS OF ABIDE BY THE REQUIREMENTS HAVING THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE PROVIDE- INSPECTIONS- FOR THESE FOR ABOUT HALF OF THEM ONCE A YEAR.

AND WITH AMATEUR WE'VE EXHAUSTED ALL COMMENTS IN Q. AND YOU BRING ABOUT COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OF RESPONDED THAT MR LACK. BUT IT THANK AUTHOR FOR BRINGING FORWARD THIS BILL AND JUST KIND OF TO GIVE US OF THE SCOPE THAT YOU'VE SHARED WITH US- WITH THE HUNT GUN SHOWS. ANNUALLY IN CALIFORNIA WHERE OVER THOUSAND FIREARMS CAN BE SOLD ON ANY SINGLE WEEKEND TO MEANS THAT WE HAVE A HUNDRED GUNS PASSING- THESE FARES AND I JUST WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE YOU ARE PROMOTING. THAT THE ADVERTISING OF SAFE STORAGE OF BEING CLEAR ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES ASSOCIATED WITH- EXPOSING GUNS TO MINORS. AT HELPING PURCHASERS BE CLEAR ON THE SAFE USAGE. OF THAT ENDS AND ALSO ON THEIR WRIST. TO REPORT THE LOSS OF POSSESSION OF A FIREARM- AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT FORWARD AND ALSO GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO. ADDRESS THE CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT THE SCOPE AND RESPONSIBILITY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. I HAVE IT ON GOOD AUTHORITY THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE CARES VERY DEEPLY. ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE REDUCE THE USE OF GUNS. GUNS AND GUN VIOLENCE IN OUR STATE. IF YOU CAN DO THAT IN YOUR CLOTHES IF YOU DON'T. MR LACKEY YEAH I THINK CLEARLY ALL OF US ARE AGAINST THE VIOLENCE OR THE VIOLENT ACTIONS WITH A GUN ESPECIALLY THE TRAGIC CIRCUMSTANCES THAT. ABOUT US AWARE OF THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE NOT MANAGING VERY WELL. BUT I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU THAT ARE APPETITE NEEDS TO BE MORE FOCUSED. TOWARDS THE BEHAVIOR WITH THAT WEAPON ARE NOT THE WEAPON ITSELF- I FIND IT. ALARMING THAT WE ARE SO FOCUSED ON CREATING MORE AND MORE PARAMETERS FOR LEGAL PURCHASERS THOSE ARE NOT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ENGAGING IN THESE VIOLENT ACTS AND- I CLEARLY PREVENTION OF PRECAUTIONS ARE. SOMETHING WE ALL SUPPORT BUT I THINK THAT THIS BILL PROVIDES A VERY ARBITRARY AND UNNECESSARY ACTIONS FOR EXAMPLE. I'M CONFUSED WHY THE LANGUAGE DOESN'T SAY AT LEAST ONE HALF. BUT IT SAYS LITERALLY ONE HALF. SO I THINK THAT THAT'S MAYBE A MINOR THING BUT SOMETHING YOU SHOULD PROBABLY CONSIDER- AMENDING- BUT THIS POINT I'M NOT IN A POSITION TO SUPPORT THE BILL BECAUSE I THINK IT HAS THE- THE PROPER FOCUS OF THIS IS TRUE- ARBITER. THANK YOU ANYMORE COMMENTS MISTER. CLARK SO- IS PART OF THE BELLI LIGHT CAN SO I'LL BE VOTING FOR IT THAT I DON'T BELIEVE IN GENERAL INCREASING PENALTIES AND THAT IS PART OF YOUR BILL. I DO LIKE THE INSPECTIONS MY CONCERN THAT THERE IS DO YOU HAVE- THE MONEY IN THE BUDGET TO ACTUALLY ALLOW FOR THESE INSPECTIONS THEN YOU CAN ANSWER THAT AND CLOSE. IF ANYONE ELSE. YOU MAY CLOSE UP MISSED SANTIAGO ONE OF THE- COOPER AND I'M PLANNING WORK HI MY- THE MAN WHO NUMBER OF PEOPLE RATHER THAN THE BOTTOM LINE MORE GUNS ON THE STREET MORE LIFE. HELLO MATHIS WORKING AWAY. THAT'S NOT SOMETHING. MORE GUNS ON STREET REFLECT. I WANT TO SEE HOW WORKS- BUT WHAT ABOUT ALL THAT HAPPENED. I WILL BE IT'S NOT A ONE SIZE I KIND. WHAT THE ARTICLE. THE TEREMOS. SEVEN THE YOU MOTION ERIC SECOND OKAY WITH THAT SAID YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU I THINK THERE IS THREE FOUR MAYBE FIVE OR SIX THINGS HELLA TO BRIEFLY ADDRESS THE FIRST IS I WONDER THE AMENDMENTS THE- THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WHICH ADDRESS MISTER QUIRKS KIDS ABOUT- THE- PUNISHMENT. OF IT TO SO WE TAKEN A JOB THERE- IN MR SANTIAGO YEAH I AM VERY ANGRY AND SAD AND UPSET BUT I YOU KNOW BELIEVE THAT THE MORE ANGRY YOU ARE THE LOWER YOUR VOICE SHOULD BE. AS I'M TRYING TO BE REASONABLE HERE I DON'T THINK. THAT THE CALLER IS DEAD WRONG I DIDN'T SAY THIS WOULD HAVE PREVENTED BUT WE HAPPENED OVER THE WHAT HAPPENED BUT IT JUST SHOWS THAT. WE KNOW THAT ONE GUNS GET IN THE WRONG HANDS THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS WE CAN LOOK AT THAT. AND TO EVEN OUR OWN IT EVEN OUR OWN DISTRICT ATTORNEY ANNE MARIE SCHUBERT WAS QUOTED AFTERWARDS SAYING THERE ARE WAY TOO MANY OF THESE GHOST GUNS ON THE STREETS THAT ARE SOLD ILLEGALLY. INAPPROPRIATELY WHETHER THE INDIVIDUAL. LET DRIVES TO NEVADA TWO HOURS FROM HERE AND BUYS A MEDIC AND SHOW ZERO REGULATIONS I RIDE THAT THAT PART WE HAVE. A HUNDRED PLUS LAWS ON THE BOOKS HERE. BUT THEY DON'T MEAN A LOT UNLESS WE HAVE A FEDERAL POLICY THAT HAS A UNIFORM STANDARD SO. HAVING NEVADA IN OUR IN OUR NEIGHBORING STATES HAVING STRONG LAWS IS IMPORTANT BUT WHAT CAN WE DO HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE CAN STEP IT UP TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE DON'T LOOK THE CRACKS OF. LITERALLY ON THE DAY. THAT THE LETTER WAS SUBMITTED BY THE- RIFLE AND PISTOL ASSOCIATION AND MY UNDERSTANDING RESTED PC WAS DELIVERED BY I MISS LYNCH- THEY QUESTION HERE WHETHER OR NOT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ANYBODY HAS EVER. FOUND SOMEBODY BUYING ANY LEGAL GUN AT A GUN SHOW THAT SAME DAY OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL. ANNOUNCED THE BIGGEST ACROSS SOUTHERN. WHERE THEY WILL LITERALLY WITNESSED AT ARMS ARE PROHIBITED PERSON. INDIVIDUALS THIRTY YEARS. IN IN STATE PRISON POSSESSING FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION GO TO A GUN SHOW IN SAMBAR DINO. AND THEY WATCHED A BY GOES CAN GET. AND SO WE DO KNOW THAT TERE WASN'T PROPER BACKGROUND CHECKS TO MAKE SURE THIS PERSON SHOULD BE BUYING THIS FIREARM. SO FOR PEOPLE SAYING THIS IS GOING TO INFRINGE UPON THEIR SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHT THAT'S BALONEY. THAT'S B. S. YOU CAN STILL GO TO A GUN SHOW THERE'S BILLS THIS LEGISLATURE TO BAN GUN SHOWS. I'M NOT DOING THAT TODAY MAYBE I DON'T FOR THAT SOMEONE ABANDONED ITS STATE FAIRGROUNDS AND COUNTY FAIRS YEAH BUT THEIR GUN SHOWS THAT ARE LEGAL IN CALIFORNIA. AND THIS IS SAYS IT IS GOOD SHOWS THAT IT THIS THAT THE- MUST PUT SIGNAGE UP THERE WHICH WE HAVE IN MOST GUY READ ANYWAY FOCUS ON THE BASICS OF GUN OWNERSHIP BUT THE RESPONSIBILITIES ARE IF YOU LOSE. YOUR GUN IS STOLEN- AND SAFE STORAGE- WE HAVE A LOT OF BUSINESSES WHETHER CAR CLUBS CASINOS THE L. SALONS WE'RE GOING INSPECTED ONCE A YEAR FOR GOVERNMENT WHAT WE'RE SAYING HERE WE SUSPECT THEM EVERY OTHER YEAR. AND WE'LL LOOK SET MISTER LACKEYS AMENDMENT SAYING THAT IT WILL BE PRECISELY ONE HALF WILL BE AT AN INSPECTION ONCE EVERY OTHER YEAR FOR GUN SHY DON'T% THINK THAT'S AN OVERLY. BURDENSOME REQUIREMENTS ON GUN OWNERS AND SECOND AMENDMENT UP RIGHT FULL LEGAL INDIVIDUALS WILL HAVE NO PROBLEM GOINGAND BUYING THEIR FIREARMS AS THEY WISH AND SO THIS JUST BRINGS A LITTLE BIT MORE. SECURITY AND SAFETY TO- THE SHOWS IN CALIFORNIA AND RESPECTFULLY. ASK RIVAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU IN. AND IT'S- GOOD WHICH DAVID. ON TOP OF THIS- CORPORATE IT'S CALLED GUN BY NOT BE BY THE SO WE REDUCE TO STEP UP OUR EFFORTS TO GET THE GUNS OTHER INDIVIDUALS HANDS THE SHOULDN'T HAVE SODA. I'M GOING TO SUPPORT IT TODAY.
