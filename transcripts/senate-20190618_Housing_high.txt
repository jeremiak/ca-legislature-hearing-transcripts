CAREFREE BUT THE COMMITTEES CENTER ROTH HAS MOVED -- THE BILL COLLEAGUES OF OR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. DO SENATOR BATES -- I NOTICED THERE WAS AN ISSUE WITH THE FIRE SAFETY AND I WONDERED IF THE AUTHOR HAD ADDRESS THAT. WITH THE FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION. A PARTICULAR CONCERN THAT I HAD IS THE WILD LAND. INTERFACE THE AND CERTAINLY LOT COVERAGE ON SOME OF THESE WHEN YOU'RE ON NO LONGER LOOKING AT ZONING REQUIREMENTS. AND ACCESS TO LOTS. WHEN YOU HAVE FIRES AND CERTAINLY ON THEIR PROXIMITY TO THOSE HOMES THAT ARE NEXT TO THEM? HI IF CERTAINLY I THINK A CONCERN OF FIVE FOR FIRE SAFETY AND I WONDERED IF YOU HAVE BEEN. LISTENING AND ADDRESSING THEIR CONCERNS ON THAT I THINK BELIEVE ON MY STAFF JUST MENTION TO ME THEIR MAIN CONCERN WAS REGARDING THE POPULATION GROWTH IN THE PROXIMITY. TO HOUSING OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THIS WOULD INCREASE DENSITY WE ARE SUPPORTER OF THAT -- OBVIOUSLY IF THEY HAD -- SPECIFIC NEED A MORE SPECIFIC CONCERNS OR MOMENTS THAT THEY WANTED TO BRING FORWARD WE WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO LISTEN TO THEM AT THIS POINT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE. A PRODUCT THAT FORMER. TO BEEN SPECIFIC YEAH YES SO I THINK IF THEY WOULD. YOUR SAY HEY WE WOULD LIKE THIS IN THE BILL ABOUT IN THE BILL THEY QUIT THE MORE THAN HAPPY. TO OF COURSE LISTEN TO THE MAJORITY. YEAH AND I AND WE DID RECEIVE. THAT LETTER -- I DID REVIEW IT AND I HAVE. TO ASSIST ON THE LOS POLITICS AND THE AUTHOR I I WAS REALLY PERPLEXED BY THIS BILL THE BILL PROVIDE EARLY SEASON BY THE SOME -- LETTER THE LETTER PROVIDES NO SPECIFICS ABOUT WHAT -- THEY WANT WHICH IS SAYS THIS IS A LOT MORE HOUSING AND POPULATION AND THAT MAKES IT HARDER FOR FIRE FIGHTING OF COURSE WE NEED. TO ADEQUATELY FUND FIRE SERVICES BUT THE REALITY IS CALIFORNIA'S BEEN EXPOSED GROWING POPULATION WE NEED ENOUGH HOUSING. THIS IS AN ARGUMENT AGAINST ADDING ANY NEW HOUSING SO. IT'S A PROBLEMATIC LETTER -- SO YEAH. I I JUST BROUGHT IT UP BUT CHAIRMAN BECAUSE WE'VE HAD A COUPLE I THINK JUST IN THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS WHERE THE PROXIMITY OF ONE HOUSE TO ANOTHER THAT CAUGHT FIRE. ACTUALLY ENGAGE THOUGHT THE OTHER PROPERTIES -- PART OF ZONING IN OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE TO DO IS SET BACK FROM THE SET BACKS HAVE MORE TO DO IT. ACCESS FOR PUBLIC SAFETY THAN THEY DO FOR YOU KNOW THE AND MINORITIES THAT ARE THERE SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED WITH ALL THE EIGHTY YOU -- LEGISLATION ON MY TWO CONCERNS ARE CERTAINLY THAT AND I THINK I'VE BEEN PRETTY PRETTY WELL KNOWN. FOR MY CONCERN ABOUT PARKING ISSUES SO I AM LAYING OFF ALL THESE BILLS TO SEE WHICH ONE FINALLY ALL COMES TOGETHER BUT I DON'T THINK WE CAN DENY. WHAT IS BEEN TRADITIONAL IN TERMS OF ZONING THAT HAS MORE TO DO WITH PUBLIC SAFETY THEY ON? YOU KNOW THE THE ACCOUTREMENT FUNNY ON THE ARCHITECTURAL FEATURES ON THOSE ARE THINGS THAT CERTAINLY. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE SPENT MAYBE TOO MUCH TIME ON DESIGN REVIEW BUT WHEN YOU'RE DOING PUBLIC SAFETY REVIEW AND YOU LOOK AT WHAT HOW THESE -- PLANNERS ORIGINALLY SET FOR ZONING REQUIREMENTS THEY HAD A LOT TO DO WITH PUBLIC SAFETY AND I'D I DON'T WANT US TO MISS THAT AS WE LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE THIS WHICH I THINK IS A POSITIVE I'M NOT SAYING THAT HE TO USE OR NOT I THINK THEY'RE THEY'RE GOOD. BUT I CAN CALL IN LAGUNA BEACH FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE INCORPORATED SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY THEY HAD MANY GRANNY FLAT FOOTED MEET -- PUBLIC SAFETY STANDARDS THE WAY THEY WERE HOOKED UP FOR A LOT -- FOR ENERGY AND ALL OF THAT AND LET US NOT LOSE THAT WHEN THERE ARE LOOKING AT BUILDING STANDARDS SOMEONE YOU HAVE THE FIRE CHOOSE BRING ENOUGH IT JUST STRUCK ME THAT. IS THAT WHAT THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN SPECIFIC SO I THINK I'M IN A SUPPORT THIS. ONE BUT PUT OUT THERE THAT THEY NEED TO BE SPECIFIC ABOUT THE CONCERNED BECAUSE THEN WE WILL NEED TO LOOK AT THE ZONING REQUIREMENTS AND GIVE MORE FLEXIBILITY TO THAT. AND IT I THINK I CAN FIGURE THE MEMBERS WE TOOK IN THIS COMMITTEE ALSO ASKED AT T. TO ADDRESS HEALTH AND SAFETY YEAH -- CONCERNS AS WELL SO -- WE WOULD HOPE THAT THE PARTIES WERE MORE THAN HAPPY TO TALK TO THEM AND IF NOT THEY HAVE EVERY OPPORTUNITY TALK TO EACH CITY AS THEY'RE REVIEWING THIS. THANK YOU AND I JUST DONE APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS CENTER BATES ONE OTHER THING TO KEEP IN MIND IT'S A WHEN COMMUNITIES -- SUPPRESS EIGHTY USE DAY GET BILL ANYWAY AND THEY'RE ILLEGAL -- AND SO THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY INSPECTED OR OR COMPLY WITH THE CODES -- AND SO -- ONE OF THE GOALS HERE IS TO TRY TO BRING EVERYTHING INTO THE SUNLIGHT -- AND HAVE AND HAVE THE SAFETY THAT I KNOW WE BOTH WANT SOME. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. OKAY SEEING NINE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE RESPECT PRESS. FOR THANK YOU -- WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR ROTH AND WE WILL CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTY NINE BY SOMEONE NUMBER CHIANG THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND WE'RE FOR THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS SENATOR WIENER AYE WIENER AYE MORAL. MORRELL AYE BATES BATES AYE CAMARO. CAMARO I DRAWS A MCGUIRE MORE LOCK. MY LOOK I ROUGH. ROUGH I SKINNER. UMBERG LOOK OWSKI BECAUSE HE I SEVEN VOTES WHICH IS AN APPLE OKAY -- PUT ON CALL FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU THANK YOU. HEY I SEE THAT I SOME MEMBER BLOOM IS HERE WHO HAS -- TWO BILLS TODAY ONE THE THIRD IS ON CONSENT. SOME CONTENT [inaudible] RIGHT. WHICH ONE IS IT. ON CONSENT SENATOR. MISTER CHAIR. TOLD NINETY SOME CONCERNS. NO NO THAT'S GLORIA I'M SORRY. THAT'S RIGHT YEAH I'M SORRY MY APOLOGIES -- ALL -- THREE YOU'LL NEED 2% TODAY. OKAY -- SO WE'LL START WITH ITEM NUMBER TEN A. B. E.. EIGHTY ONE PERFECT -- CARRYING ON THE THEME OF ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS AND TO I JUST WANNA OPEN BY SAYING HOW PROUD I AM AND I KNOW SENATOR WHITE HOUSE KEY -- BILLS THE SAME WAY OF BEING THE TO AUTHORS OF THE ORIGINAL LADY LEGISLATION THIS IS SO WE KNEW IT WAS GOING TO CATCH ON BOTH -- WE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW I THINK AT THAT TIME -- JUST HOW MUCH THE IDEA WAS GONNA RESONATE WITH CALIFORNIANS THAT WE NOW KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY MANY THOUSANDS OF UNITS THAT HAVE BEEN BUILT. AS A RESULT OF THAT ORIGINAL LEGISLATION SO -- AND A FURTHER TO YOUR COMMENTS EARLIER MISTER CHAIR -- I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT -- WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING WITH SENATOR WHITE HOUSE KEY -- AND TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING TIM -- MAKE SURE THAT -- ALL THESE BILLS ARE LANDED IN A WAY THAT. IS APPROPRIATE MIKE -- BILLS AT DOES SERVE SEVERAL THINGS A PERSON CLARIFIES THEM DEFINITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING THE DEFINITION OF PUBLIC TRANSIT -- WHEN EIGHTY IS DISTANCE CAN BE FROM TRANSIT AND THE TYPES OF EXISTING STRUCTURES THAT CAN BE CONVERTED TO EIGHTY YEARS SECONDLY? IT REMOVES PROVISIONS THAT HAVE GIVEN CITIES AND REASONABLY BROAD DISCRETION FOR DENYING EIGHTY YOU PERMITS AND FINALLY IT REMOVES THE OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENT IN THE EXISTING STATUTE WHICH IS. UNFAIRLY SUBJECTED EIGHTY USED TO A REQUIREMENT THAT DOESN'T EXIST FOR ANY OTHER TYPE OF HOUSING. COULD RESULT IN EIGHTY IS BEING DEMOLISHED AND IT CREATES LONG TERM UNCERTAINTY AROUND THE UNITS FUTURE AFTER IT'S BEEN BUILT. THE FIVE YEAR SUNSET -- TO THAT PARTICULAR PROVISION WAS -- ADDED TO GIVE THE LEGISLATURE AN OPPORTUNITY TO EVALUATE ITS IMPACT -- AND SO AB EIGHT EIGHT ONE IS HERE TO HELP PAY TO USE REALIZE THEIR FULL POTENTIAL AS THE OTHER OF BILLS TO AS WELL. AND TO TESTIFY IN FAVOR HAVE FOR LOOSE BRONTE FROM CALIFORNIA EMB TO SPEAK MORE ON THE NEED FOR THE BILL. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS LUIS MONTERO CALIFORNIAN BE -- I THINK AB -- EIGHT EIGHT ONE IS IMPORTANT AS IMPORTANT POLICY STEP FOR THE LEGISLATOR LEGISLATURE TO TAKE FOR THE SAME REASONS THAT. I AB SIXTY EIGHT AND SIXTY NINE ARE. MOST IMPORTANTLY PERHAPS THIS BILL ELIMINATES THE OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENTS OR OR THE ALLOWANCE FOR FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO IMPOSE AN OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENT -- WE'VE HEARD FROM HOMEOWNERS AROUND THE STATE THAT THAT OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENT CAN BE A BIG BARRIER TO OBTAINING FINANCING AND IT'S JUST ANOTHER HURDLE FOR THEM TO CEAR. UP BANKS ARE RELUCTANT WE'VE SEEN TO LAND -- WHEN THERE'S GOING TO BE A DEED RESTRICTION THAT COMPLICATES THINGS AND AND THEY SORT OF HAVEN'T YET FIGURED OUT HOW TO HANDLE THAT -- AND SO REMOVING THE ON OCCUPANCY YOU A REQUIREMENT FOR FIVE YEARS. TO SEE YOU SEE HOW SEE SEE HOW THAT CLEARS UP THE MARKET A LITTLE BIT -- IS GOING TO BE A VERY POSITIVE STEP FORWARD -- JUST SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL. WILL COME. WORK WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS IN SUPPORT. MY CLAIM IS SO THE COMBO AT HOME IN SUPPORT. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND SUPPORT. TODAY THE BAY AREA HOUSING OUT TO SEE COALITION SUPPORT. GET THE ROW ENTERPRISE CUNY PARTNERS IN SUPPORT. TURNING BUT WE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION HERE SUPPORT.

ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. OKAY SEEING NONE WERE ABOUT THE COMMITTEES CENTER ROTH HAS MOVED. OF THE BILL ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS COLLEAGUES. FOR I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS SO THIS IS ACTUALLY. QUITE IMPORTANT AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS IS AN IS REQUIREMENTS ARE IMPOSED ON ANY OTHER KINDS OF HOUSING. AND FRANKLY IT'S A ANTI RENTER -- TO TO HAVE THESE KINDS OF REQUIREMENTS AND 40% OF CALIFORNIANS ARE RENTERS -- AND WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE ADAM. STOP PRETENDING THAT EVERYONE ON SERRANO NOT EVERYONE DOES SO. I THANK YOU FOR THIS AND THIS DOESN'T TO A HIGH RECOMMENDATION. IF THERE'S NO OTHER OPTION ACOSTA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND HE LIMITATION THE CRITERIA THAT THE LOCALS AGENCIES COULD BE ABLE TO USE TO LIMIT THE PLACEMENT. JUST HAD A CONVERSATION ABOUT. FIRE SAFETY -- IT INCLUDES WATER SEWER SERVICES TRAFFIC FLOW. IN PUBLIC SAFETY. CAN YOU WHAT IS YOUR THOUGHTS ON ON THIS. EVOLVING ISSUE OF HAVING EIGHTY USED IN THE WE WE AND THAT MAY COMPOUND THE POTENTIAL FIRE DANGER BY HAVING THAT. IT ADDITIONAL DENSITY. I THINK IN THE IN THE TYPICAL SETTING THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM WHEN -- YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT EIGHTY IS HIM NOW RURAL AREAS THERE ARE TYPICALLY GOING TO BE -- BECAUSE THERE'S MORE SPACE ON LOTS ARE TYPICALLY GOING TO BE SEPARATED BUT AND IN OUR THE DENSER URBAN COMMUNITIES -- BUILDINGS ARE ALREADY PACKED IN PRETTY CLOSE TO ONE ANOTHER AND I DON'T THINK THAT -- IT'S A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN WE CERTAINLY HAVEN'T HEARD THAT FROM -- ANY PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCY -- IF IT WERE TO BE IDENTIFIED AS A PROBLEM I THINK THERE ARE PROBABLY LIMITED FIXES THAT TO COULD BE BUILT INTO THE TO THE BELL TO APPLY IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES YEAH HI FIRING IS FOR CAPITAL CONCEIVABLY THAT LOCAL AGENCY EVEN THOUGH IT'S A LIMITATION ON THEIR POWER. IF THE NEW DATA CAME OUT AND INFORMATION ON ON THE FIRE DANGER THAN THAT WOULD BE CORRECT YOUR CRITERIA THAT THEY COULD. THEY COULD INCLUDE IN THEIR EVALUATION THAT'S CORRECT OKAY THANK YOU. CASEY NO ADDITIONAL -- QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS -- CLOSE. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE THANK YOU OKAY -- WE WILL CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS ON THE BILL EIGHTY ONE BY SOME REMEMBER BLOOM THE MOTION IS TO PASS REFER THE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE SENATOR WIENER. WIENER AYE MORRELL AYE MORRELL AYE BATES. CARILLO. CAROL I DRAWS -- MCGUIRE MORE LOCK. MORE LIKE A FIVE ROUGH. ROUGH I SKINNER. UMBERG CASKEY. CASSIE I AT SIX ZERO WILL PUT THE BILL ON CALL AND NOW WE ARE GOING -- TO TEMPORARILY LEAVE -- YOU DO YOU COLUSA AND FOR DIFFERENT EIGHTY VOTES TODAY -- AND WE WILL GO TO ITEM NUMBER TWELVE AB. THIRTEEN NINETY NINE THANK YOU -- THAT MISTER CHAIR -- ALSO IMPORTANT ISSUE -- AND THAT IS THE ELLIS ACT -- THIS IS REFORM BILL AND TO THE BILL MAKES CLARIFYING CHANGES TO THE ELSE ACT THAT ARE INTENDED TO BOTH ENSURE FAIRNESS FOR TENANTS AND REMOVE AMBIGUITY FOR BOTH. LANDLORDS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE ELLIS ACT WAS INTENDED AS A MEANS FOR LANDLORDS TO EXIT THE RENTAL HOUSING BUSINESS. BUT NOT INTENDED AS AN END RUN AROUND LOCAL PROTECTIONS FOR TENANTS AND UNFORTUNATELY -- A LIMITED NUMBER BUT SOME LANDLORDS USED TO LOG TO DO JUST THAT AND THAT'S LEAD TO UNNECESSARY LITIGATION. AND IN MANY CASES DISPLACEMENT OF TENANTS. TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AND ABUSES A. B. THIRTEEN NINETY NINE WILL CLARIFY THE ELLIS ACT IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS. FIRST IT CLARIFIES THAT WHEN A LANDLORD WITHDRAWS A BUILDING UNDER THE ELSE ACT THERE'S ONLY ONE WITHDRAWAL DATE. AND ONE DAY FOR RETURNING THE UNITS TO THE RENTAL MARKET. A LANDLORD WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PICK AND CHOOSE WHICH UNITS TO RETURN -- SECOND THE BILL PROVIDES AN EXCEPTION TO THE TO WHAT I JUST DESCRIBED FOR UNITS THAT ARE OWNER OCCUPIED. AT THE TIME OF WITHDRAWAL AND MAKES CLEAR THAT THE PAYMENT OF A PENALTY DOES NOT EXTINGUISH THE LANDLORDS OBLIGATION TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW. AND FINALLY THE LAW CLARIFIES THAT IF A LANDLORD ALLOWS A TENANT WHO NEEDS MORE TIME. TO MOVE TO STAY BEYOND THE END OF THE TERMINATION NOTICE THAT VOLUNTARY ACTION BY THE LANDLORD DOES NOT EXTEND THE TIME LINE UNDER THE ACT. UPON TAKING THESE LAST -- AT THE THE LAST SET OF AMENDMENTS ON THE BILL WE RAN INTO SOME TECHNICAL ISSUES IN A LANGUAGE WHICH SOMETIMES HAPPENS AND WE'RE WORKING OUT THOSE DIFFERENCES WITH CALIFORNIA REALTORS ASSOCIATION. AND THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION AND WE'LL HAVE THAT FINALIZED BY THE NEXT COMMITTEE. THIS BILL PROVIDES CERTAINTY FOR LANDLORDS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND TENANTS AND PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL SECURITY FOR THOSE WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE FOR A TO DISPLACEMENT IN HERE TO FURTHER DISCUSS THE POST BRYAN ACOSTA WITH THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS BRIAN A GUEST ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION AND THE SANTA MONICA CONTROL BOARD. IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE -- I THINK IT IS REMARKABLE THAT AUTHORS AND A GREAT JOB OF EXPLAINING WHAT THE BILL DOES -- BUT I THINK IT'S REMARKABLE THAT WE HAVE AN ALICE ACT BILL THAT -- IT IN WHICH EVERYONE. THE TENANT ADVOCATES AND THE THE LANDLORDS ARE IN AGREEMENT ABOUT THE CONCEPTS WERE WORKING OUT JUST A FEW. CHANGES TO THE LANGUAGE BARRIER AS A RESULT OF THIS BILL WE WILL BOTH ENHANCE THE CLARITY -- PRESERVE THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE LAW AND REDUCE LITIGATION OVER SOME AMBIGUITIES EXISTED IN THE LAW. SO WE THINK -- THIS COMPROMISE MEASURES VERY IMPORTANT ALL THE MINOR CHANGE THE LAW AND WE WOULD URGE AN AYE VOTE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON ON A LAWLER WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IN SUPPORT. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS HOLY MEASURE BEHALF OF THE CITY OF WEST HOLLYWOOD IN SUPPORT.

OKAY WILL BRING BACK -- TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ON THIS BILL COLLEAGUES. OKAY -- DO PROMOTION. BY SENATOR CABALLERO. AND SOMEONE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE AT THAT THANK YOU -- AS YOU AS YOU HEARD FROM EVERYONE -- I THINK WE ALL ANTICIPATE THAT THE FINAL TECHNICAL -- HURDLES -- WILL BE SURMOUNTED IN SHORT ORDER AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. OKAY WE WILL CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS ONLY A BILL THIRTEEN NINETY NINE BY SOMEONE NUMBER BLOOM THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND REFER THE COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY. SENATOR WIENER. FIVE ZERO BATES MCGUIRE [inaudible] MORE LOCK. ROUGH. ROUGH I SKINNER. AMBERG -- CASKEY. YES. CAROLINE. ROTH I RESERVE. TO THE VOTERS -- THREE ZERO WE'LL PUT THAT ON CALL FOR UP TO MEMBERS. AND YOU HAVE -- SOME NUMBER ONE FINAL BILL THAT IS NUMBER SIXTEEN AB. SIXTEEN FIFTY NINE THANK YOU THIS IS -- AS YOU SAID A. B. SIXTEEN FIFTY NINE MISTER CHAIR AND IT WILL ALLOW FOR THE CREATION OF NONPROFIT TO A PUBLIC BENEFIT CORPORATIONS. TO ISSUE BONDS THAT OUR STATE INCOME TAX EXEMPT TO CREATE A PREDICTABLE AND STABLE SOURCE OF FUNDS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. THIS BILL WILL ALLOW THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES TO CREATE THE STATE'S FIRST LOCAL HOUSING FINANCE CORPORATION WHICH WILL ISSUE STATE INCOME TAX EXEMPT BONDS. AT BELOW MARKET RATE. THE LOW COST BONDS WILL BE USED TO FINANCE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS AND ALLOW THE AGENCY TO OFFER LOW COST MORTGAGES AND LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME -- FOR LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME. HOME BUYERS LOS ANGELES IS NEW HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY WILL USE AN INITIAL TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO FUND A PROJECTED ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS THE SELF SUSTAINING MODEL DOES NOT REQUIRE INVESTMENTS FROM THE GENERAL FUND OR ANY TAXPAYER DOLLARS AND INSULATES THE CITY FROM FINANCIAL RISK. I WANT TO NOTE THAT MY OFFICE IS WORKING WITH STAFF IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE ON AMENDMENTS WHICH WILL INCREASE TRANSPARENCY -- AS IS NOTED IN THE COMMUNITY AT THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS -- AB SIXTEEN FIFTY NINE PROVIDES AN INNOVATIVE TOOL FOR CITIES TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING CRISIS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND WITH ME ARE. BEEN WINTER THE CHIEF HOUSING OFFICER OF FOR THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND SHAUN SPEAR THE ASSISTANT MANAGER AND A HOUSING DEVELOPMENT BUREAU THERE -- BOTH ARE IN THEIR CAR CITIES OFFICES I MENTION AND THEY CAN DISCUSS THE BILL FURTHER ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. BUT GOOD AFTERNOON -- BEEN WINTER TWO THOUSAND OFFICER FOR LOS ANGELES MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI. I'M HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB SIXTEEN FIFTY NINE WHICH WOULD ALLOW CITIES PLANNING TO CREATE A NON PROFIT PUBLIC BENEFIT CORPORATION. TO SELL CONDUIT MORTGAGE REVENUE BONDS THAT ARE EXEMPT FROM TAX -- FROM STATE INCOME TAX TO FUND MUCH NEEDED AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- AS THE HOMELESS POINT IN TIME COUNT START TO ROLL IN ACROSS THE STATE. IT'S BECOME ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT ARE STATEWIDE AFFORDABILITY CRISIS AND HOUSING SHORTAGE. ARE CLEARLY LINKED TO THE RISE IN HOMELESSNESS. THANKS TO VOTERS IN LOS ANGELES WE HAVE MORE THAN FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AUTHORIZED THROUGH TO LOCAL MEASURES PROPOSITION HHH A MEASURE H.. TO TACKLE THIS CHALLENGE OVER THE NEXT DECADE -- AND WE'RE ALREADY STARTING TO SEE SOME PROGRESS FROM THESE MEASURES. IN COORDINATION WITH THE COUNTY WE PERMANENTLY HOUSE MORE THAN TWENTY ONE THOUSAND PERSONS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT'S MORE THAN DOUBLE THAN WHAT WE HAD FOUR YEARS AGO. BUT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT FELL INTO HOMELESSNESS LAST YEAR. OUTPACED HOW MANY PEOPLE THE SYSTEM COULD PLACE AND A HOUSING WHICH MEANS WE NEED AN EVEN MORE AGGRESSIVE. AGENDA ON THAT NOT ONLY REMOVES REGULATORY BARRIERS FOR HOUSING PRODUCTION OVERALL BUT ALSO LAYS THE GROUNDWORK FOR FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGING HOW WE FINANCE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN LOS ANGELES. SO THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT GIVE CITIES LIKE LA A NEW TOOL THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS LIKE WE'VE NEVER DONE BEFORE. LEVERAGING MORE THAN TEN DOLLARS FOR EVERY LOCAL DOLLAR THAT WE PUT INTO AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- IT ALSO WILL GIVE US MUCH MORE FLEXIBILITY TO CREATE A NEW LOAN PRODUCTS -- TO INCREASE THE PIPELINE OF AFFORDABLE IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING AND TO ENCOURAGE MORE MIXED INCOME DEVELOPMENTS SO FOR THOSE REASONS MAYOR CITY IS A PROUD SPONSOR OF AB. SIXTEEN FIFTY NINE AND THANKS ASSEMBLYMEMBERS BLOOM A FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THE MATTER. AND WE'RE JOINED HERE A SHAUN SPARE ASSISTANT GENERAL MANAGER TO HELP ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS IF YOU MAY HAVE THEM. THANK YOU -- ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. PLEASE COME FORWARD. MISTER CHAIRMAN HOLDEN MEASURE BEHALF OF THE CITY OF WEST HOLLYWOOD IN SUPPORT THANK YOU HI. IN ADDITIONAL SUPPORT I SING ON IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SAME NUMBER BACK -- TO THE COMMITTEE -- ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS CENTER MORE LOCK YOUR CINNAMON BLOOM THEIR MICROPHONES ON OFF IT'S TIME TO GET A RED LIGHT ON GET THE SERGEANT -- MAYBE I COULD ASK BUT PERHAPS YOU DON'T SPEAK WITH A LOUD ENOUGH VOICE. I HARPER HARDLY THINK THAT'S THE CASE THOUGH SENATOR. PRETTY QUIET GUY. IF I HEARD THIS RIGHT THE CITY'S NOT LIABLE. AND THERE'S NO GENERAL FUND INVOLVEMENT. THAT'S MY MICROPHONE MIGHT BE BROKEN ADAM. THAT'S CORRECT THE OF THE NONPROFIT A PUBLIC BENEFIT CORPORATION BE SPECIFICALLY SET UP TO INSULATE BOTH THE CITY IN TERMS OF ANY REVENUE OR LEGAL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACTIVITIES OF THE NONPROFIT -- AS WELL AS THE NONPROFIT ITSELF IN TERMS OF LIABILITY IN TERMS OF POSSIBLY HAVING -- FUNDS DIVERTED FROM THE PURPOSES OTHER THAN FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND THEN DO YOU -- HAVE DEFAULT DEFAULT REMEDIES LIKE -- ARE YOU GOING TO ENSURE THE BONDS -- THE THOUGHT SO THERE ARE A COUPLE DIFFERENT -- FINANCING MECHANISMS THAT MIGHT BRING -- BOND AS EFFECTIVELY -- A CREDIT ENHANCEMENT TO THE BONDS OR EFFECTIVELY IN INSURANCE VEHICLE -- THOSE WILL BE EXPLORED AS THE CORPORATION WOULD BE DEVELOPED. SO THEN THE BOND HOLDERS WHICH IS RELY ON THE NONPROFIT AND IF. THERE'S DEFAULT AND THAT'S JUST THE WAY GOES THAT'S YOUR RISK. YES THAT'S THAT IS CORRECT IT WOULD INSULATE THE CITY FROM ANY LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER ANNA CABALLERO. SO FIRST -- LET ME SAY THAT I RIGHT THIS IS -- AN INNOVATIVE CONCEPT I LIKE IT -- SEC A GREAT IDEA BUT I HAVE TO SAY IT'S THE SKINNY AS BILL [inaudible] WITH. I MEAN IT'S TWO PAGES RIGHT -- IT DOESN'T TELL US MUCH IN SO I WAS STRUGGLING WITH THEM WITH SOME OF THE DETAILS IN PARTICULAR -- SINCE I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE THE MODEL FOR OTHER CITIES THAT CAN FIND THEMSELVES IN THE SAME UP WITH THE SAME OPPORTUNITY A BIG CITY WITH. A LOT OF RESOURCES IS -- YEAH I WAS CONCERNED THAT IN AB ONE OF THE ISSUES I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT IS -- IF IT'S A CITY SPONSORED IN THE IT LA IS IN THE NAME -- AT THE CREDIT -- CONFUSION THAT MAY OCCUR YOU'RE YOU'RE DEALING WITH BOND HOLDERS SO YOU'RE GOING TO BE OUT IN THE MARKET -- AND THE OLD REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES HADN'T THE NAME OF THE CITIES AS WELL AND AND AS YOU KNOW THE CITY. THE CITY STOOD BEHIND THE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY OBLIGATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS AND SO -- AT I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THAT I ACT CONCERNED AS WELL AS IN TERMS OF HOW THE BONDS GET REPAID AND I GUESS IT'S OUT OF THE MORTGAGE. THE THE MORTGAGE LENDING THAT'S OCCURRED -- ALSO ABOUT BOND LIMITS -- CAN IT BE. YOU KNOW HOW HOW MUCH BINDING IS APPROPRIATE.% AND AND THEN ALL I'M IN ADDITION CONCERNS ABOUT NEPOTISM. AND I'M ASSUMING THAT SOME OF THIS HOUSING WILL BE MULTI STORY BECAUSE IT'S PRETTY HARD TO BUILD IN A BUILT UP CITY UNLESS YOU'RE YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT WHICH THEN MEANS YOU'RE DOING MAKES USE. AND IF YOU'RE DOING MAKES USE -- THEN -- THE THE CONCERN I HAD WAS THIS ONLY PERTAINS TO HOUSING IT DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OR OR PRIVATE INVESTMENT SO AT SOME POINT YOU MAY HAVE TO DO SOMETHING WITH PRIVATE INVESTORS -- AND THEN -- AT THAT THE FINAL NOTE THAT I HAD IT AND I WAS JUST TRYING. TO THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX BECAUSE LIKE I SAID THERE WASN'T MUCH IN THE BILL -- THERE WEREN'T ANY GUIDE RAILS I GUESS PUT IT THAT WAY -- THAT THAT SAY HERE'S HERE'S OUR MISSION HERE'S OUR GOAL HERE'S WHAT WE WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO DRIVE TOWARDS. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT. THAT CITIES TO BIG CITIES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE SEEN OF A SIGNIFICANT INFLUX OF DOLLARS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES. I THINK WE WANT TO BE CAREFUL THAT -- THERE THERE ISN'T AND AND THE NEPOTISM HAD TO DO WITH. WITH -- THE THAT THAT MORTGAGE THE MORTGAGEE MORTGAGE HOLDERS ARE THE THE PERSON THAT PERSON'S IT WOULD GET MORTGAGE -- MORTGAGES -- BEING FAMILY MEMBERS OR POLITICAL FRIENDS. AND AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS QUITE FRANKLY THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT GETS BUILT ALONG THE COAST IN THE VERY EXPENSIVE AREAS. TENDS TO GO TO THE CHILDREN WHO GREW UP THERE IN THAT COMMUNITY WHO CUT WHO COME BACK GO GET AN EDUCATION COME BACK. AND THEY'RE EARNING THEIR FIRST WAGES AND DON'T MAKE MUCH MONEY AND THEY'RE THE ONES WHO QUALIFIED AS OPPOSED TO THE BLUE COLLAR WORKING CLASS -- MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY THAT HAVE BEEN THERE FOR YEARS AND SO. I'M INTERESTED IN THIS REALLY. DRILLING DOWN INTO THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT HELP KEEP THE ECONOMY MOVING NOT THE SONS AND CHILDREN OF THE ELECTED OFFICIALS AND SO THAT'S THAT'S THE THE REASON I WOULD I WAS LOOKING AT THIS IN TERMS OF OF YOU KNOW THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SOME REAL MAJOR INVESTMENTS. AND TO BRING AFFORDABLE REAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT BUT I THINK THERE'S GOING TO NEED TO BE SOME -- SOME COMMITMENT TO SET SOME OF THIS IS THAT I DON'T SEE IN THE BILL SO I AM GONNA SUPPORTED TODAY BUT I JUST WANT TO THROW THAT OUT THERE -- BECAUSE I DO THINK IT'LL BE I THINK IT CAN BE A MODEL FOR OTHER COMMUNITIES BUT I ALSO DON'T WANT TO SEE A SCANDAL HAPPENED THAT REALLY MAKES AN EMBARRASSING SO. I GUESS IT'S NOT A QUESTION BUT I IF YOU'VE GOT SOME IDEAS IN TERMS OF HOW. IT AND MAYBE THE ENABLING DOCUMENTS OF THAT OF THE OF THE NONPROFIT DEAL WITH SOME OF THIS KIND OF OF CONCERN BUT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT IN THE BALLOT SITE. THE COULD BE HELPFUL IF -- MISTER SPEAKER MISTER WINTER -- YEAH I I THINK TO SOME RESPONSE SURE THANK YOU -- THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND AND CONCERNS THERE I THINK THEY ARE VALID ONES TO HAVE WHEN DEALING WITH INNOCENCE WHAT IS THE PUBLIC RUST IN TERMS OF AN ENTITY THAT WOULD BE -- SUPPORTING THE COMMUNITIES GOALS AROUND OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND MAKING SURE THOSE ARE GOVERNED IN A VERY -- PROPER WAY IN A VERY OPEN PUBLIC WAY SO WHAT I WOULD SAY IN GENERAL IS THAT -- WHILE THIS WOULD BE A NEW ENTITY TO CALIFORNIA THERE ARE SIMILAR ENTITIES -- SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY -- NEW YORK CITY AS AS SORT OF SEEN AS THE BLUE RIBBON MODEL OF THIS WITH THAT THERE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION. THEY REGULARLY ARE DOING MORE THAN ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR -- IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING ACTIVITY. AND AS PART OF THAT THEY ARE SET UP AS THOUGH IT THOUGH IT IS TECHNICALLY SEPARATE ENTITY FROM THE CITY -- IT HAS -- GOVERNANCE RULES AROUND IT ACTING AS A CONDUIT ISSUER AS WELL AS A MORTGAGE REVENUE BOND ISSUER SO-THERE'S OPEN POLICIES IN TERMS OF ITS ANNUAL REPORT IN TERMS OF ITS ANNUAL AUDITS -- AS WELL AS ITS -- PUBLIC MEETING SO THROUGH AFFORDS BOARD OF DIRECTORS WE WOULD BE EMULATING MANY OF THOSE THINGS EXACTLY TO TO THE LETTER -- WHEN IT COMES TO THIS ENTITY BECAUSE IT WILL BE A PUBLIC BENEFIT CORPORATION SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CITY WHAT WE SO WHILE HAS NOT BEEN FORMED YET WHAT WE ARE FULLY EXPECTING? THE CITY COUNCIL AND MAYOR WOULD WANT TO SEE IN THIS IS THAT IT WOULD HAVE A VERY OPEN AND PUBLIC A GOVERNANCE. VEHICLE MAKE SURE THAT IT COMPLIES WITH ALL APPLICABLE HOUSING OF A PARTICULAR FAIR HOUSING RULES AS WELL. SO I THINK MANY OF THOSE ISSUES WOULD BE ADDRESSED AS PART OF THE ORDINANCE THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY CREATE THE THE CORPORATION ITSELF. THOUGH JUST TO JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT YEAR CONCEPT IS JUST GIVE US THE AUTHORITY AND THEN WILL TAKE THE REST OF IT AND WE'LL PUT IT IN AN ORDINANCE. AT THE AT THE CITY LEVEL YES THE KEY THING IS THAT -- CITIES ACTUALLY DO CURRENTLY HAVE THE ABILITY TO CREATE NONPROFIT PUBLIC BENEFIT CORPORATIONS AND SO THERE'S ONE FOR THE AIRPORTS AS AN EXAMPLE IN THE CITY OF LA -- THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST ONE FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON HOUSING THOUGH SO WHAT THE BILL ACTUALLY PROPOSES IS TO HAVE THE THE BONDS THAT WOULD BE ISSUED BY THE CENTER T. THAT THE CITY CAN ALREADY CREATE. BUT HAVE THEM BE EXEMPT FROM STATE TAX. OKAY THANK YOU I YEAH I'M JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE -- THE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN COORDINATING WITH THE GOVERNMENT FINANCES CURRENTS OF FINANCE COMMITTEE AND WE UNDERSTAND I THINK THE AUTHORS INDICATED THE BILL NEEDS TO BE FLUSHED OUT MORE IN. A COMMON FINANCE WILL BE DOING THAT WORK WITH THE AUTHOR. CASEY NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SO AND WE DO HAVE A MOTION. SIR WAS UP FROM CENTER CABALLERO EARLIER. DO WE HAVE A MOTION ON THIS. COMPELLED OKAY MOVE BY CENTER CABALLERO WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU -- AS SENATOR CABALLERO JUST MENTIONED -- THIS IS AN INNOVATIVE IDEA ALL THOUGH IT'S NOT A NEW IDEA IT'S AND USE AND OTHER SETTINGS HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND SPECIFICALLY FOR HOUSING IN.

AND ONE ADULT LIVING IN A MOBILE HOME COMMUNITY THE FIRE STRUCK IN ONE OF THE THREE MOBILE HOME PARKS IN SAN JOSE THE ONLY MONTHS EARLIER HAD FLOODED WITH COYOTE CREEK TOPPED. ITS BANKS DURING THESE LAST TWO YEARS THE SOUND OF THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAS RESPONDED TO TWENTY SIX MOBILE HOME FIRES IN OUR JURISDICTION. THIS BILL REALLY IS ABOUT EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND WHILE FIRST REPORT RESPONDERS KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO AT THE TIME OF A DISASTER WE NEED TO ALSO MAKE SURE THAT RESIDENTS ARE INFORMED. OF EVACUATION READ ANY READINESS AND PREPARED FOR THE NEXT FIRE FLOOD OR EARTHQUAKE FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY URGE DRIVE OUT [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR.

GOOD AFTERNOON KIM STONE OF STONE ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF ALL STATE INSURANCE IN SUPPORT. MICHAEL RIGHT AGAIN I'LL BE OFF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SANTA CLARA COUNTY AND SUPPORT. MELISSA ORDER WITH THE AMERICAN RED CROSS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. IN ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. OKAY OPPOSITION. HELLO COMMITTEE MEMBERS CHAIR THE UNDER GOVERNOR ON BEHALF OF THE WESTERN MANUFACTURED HOUSING COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION WMA. WE ARE THE LARGEST ORGANIZATION REPRESENTING THE LONG PARK OWNERS IN THE STATE. IF THE BILL WERE AMENDED TO JUST BE SECTION ONE WE WOULD SUPPORT THE MEASURE HOWEVER WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE SECTION TO IN THE EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PLANS. MOBILE HOME PARK OWNERS OF THE ONLY NON SUBSIDIZED HOUSING IN THE STATE THAT HAS TO ALREADY PREPARE AND EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PLAN. BUT WE THINK THAT SECTION TWO WAS REFUNDED FOR TWO REASONS NUMBER ONE THE LEGISLATURE JUST ALLOCATED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. TO GO TOWARDS LOCAL COMMUNITIES INTO EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOR DISASTER PREPAREDNESS. THEY ALSO ALLOCATED TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO UPGRADE THE NETWORK FOR EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS. AND THEN FINALLY. AT THE AMERICAN RED CROSS DOT COM FEMA DOT GOV CALLAWAY YES GOT GOV AND READY DOT GOV THE RT TRANSLATE EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AT CISCO US IN THIS BILL IN ALMOST THIRTY LANGUAGES. TO OUR POINT IS WHY DO THIS N THE BILL WHY WHEN YOU JUST SMPLY HAVE EIGHT CD POST ON THEIR WEBSITE ACCESS TO THE WEBSITE. OPERATORS ALREADY UPON TENANTS THE ALREADY AFTER VIDE NOTIFICATION OF WHERE TO LOOK SO WHY WOULD YOU SIMPLY SPEND EXTRA MONEY TO DO SOMETHING THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS ALREADY DONE. AND ACTUALLY EVEN NONPROFIT ENTITIES HAVE DONE SO FOR THESE REASONS RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL. THANK YOU MISTER FOR ANY ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION. CASING THAT WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE COLLEAGUES ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS YES SENATOR MORE LOCK. THANK YOU MEASURE I I WAS THINKING THE SAME THING I WAS THINKING. WHY DON'T WE MAKE IT A LITTLE SIMPLER JUST AND? THE APPLICABLE LANGUAGES SAY PLEASE GO TO W. W. W. DOT. AND THEN USUAL GOOGLE APP TO TRANSLATE TO YOU CAN READ THE EMERGENCY PLAN -- WOMEN JUST SEEM TO MAKE IT IN YET SO OVERBEARING AND THAT I THINK IT'S OUR IT'S AN EASY AMENDMENT TO MAKE TO THE BILL. JUST AN OBSERVATION. THANK YOU MAY I RESPOND YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE QUESTION I EAT. THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THE MOST HELPFUL THE BUT RESIDENTS IN THE MOBILE HOME PARK. WHEN I EVEN HAVE A COMPUTER ACCESS? SO YOU KNOW YOU YOU COULD HAVE ON THE WEBSITE SOMEWHERE. BUT I AT THIS BILL WILL MANDATE THAT THE MOBILE HOME. OWNER TO HAVE SOMETHING IN PRINT IN THE CLUBHOUSE AND THEN NOTIFY THE RESIDENT. TO TERROR THERE IS A DOCUMENT THERE IN A REVIEW IT AND REBUILD IT TO IN THE LANGUAGE OF FEWER. ORIGIN. SO IT IS VERY DIFFERENT YOU KNOW USE USE OF WHILE I HAVE SOMETHING ON THE WEBSITE. AND AND VERSUS A HAND THE DIAL. HANDED DOWN A PRINTED COPY AND AND AND ASK THEM TO READ IT. THIS. THUS OF DIFFERENCES BUT THAT CAN BE DONE BY GOING TO THE PROPERTY MANAGERS OFFICE SAYING I'D LIKE TO HAVE A COPY AND FILL IN THE LANGUAGE A LOT WE XIN. AND THEY COULD THEY COULD THEN GO TO FINALLY GOT A PRINTER AND A AND A COMPUTER HERE WE CAN. DOWNLOAD IT AND JUST PUT IT FOR YOU. AS OPPOSED TO HAVING JUST ALL THESE COPIES OF OF PAPER I RIGHT NOW I THINK THE LOG OF AMENDED THEY HAVE A COPY IN ENGLISH. FOR THE SECOND PART WAS REALLY JUST A TRANSLATION PART WANTED TO BE IN SPANISH BECAUSE THAT'S WHO THE OVER THE STRESSFUL OF 5%. OF THE POPULATION THAT WE SERVE IN CALIFORNIA STOLE THIS BILL WILL ONLY ADD A TRACTOR TRANSLATED VERSION NEXT TO THE ENGLISH VERSION. SO FOES FORWARD -- TO LINK ENGLISH LEARNER AB OVAL TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT -- WELL MAYBE I COULD JUST AS THE OPPOSITION QUESTION YOU KNOW I'M. SOMEWHAT SENSITIVE TO THIS BECAUSE MY FATHER IN LAW LIVES IN ONE OF THESE PARKS AND MY FATHER IN LAW'S. EIGHTY OR EIGHTY ONE YEARS OLD ENOUGH. UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF THE SINCE THE NOTICE REQUIRES OF PLAN BE POSTED IN ENGLISH HE'S AN ENGLISH SPEAKER BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU THE NOT ONLY. DOES NOT HAVE A OWN A COMPUTER DOES NOT HAVE ONE IS MOBILE HOME I DON'T THINK HE WOULD KNOW FRANKLY WITH WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE TURN IT ON IF I PROVIDED HIM ON SO I'M JUST WONDERING. WHAT THE REAL IMPACT IS TO THE? PARK OWNERS TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- TO POST A NOTICE IN SPANISH GIVEN THE NUMBER OF SPANISH SPEAKERS THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE I'M TRYING TO BE SENSITIVE TO REQUIREMENTS ON BUSINESS AND AND I HAVING BEEN A BUSINESS OPERATOR MYSELF AND HAVING HAD THE ENTIRE BACK WALL OF MY OFFICE FILLED WITH POSTERS -- REQUIRED. I GUESS BY US. I'M SOMEWHAT SENSITIVE TO THIS. BUT MAYBE YOU COULD WITH WITH TERMS PERMISSION. WELL FIRST OFF IT'S NOT ABOUT US TRANSLATING RIGHT NOW CAL -- YES HAS DEVELOPED A MODEL PLAN NOT EIGHT CD WHICH IS WHO WOULD BE DOING THE TRANSLATION CALLOW YES IS DONE. EIGHT CD WE WOULD WE GET A GET A REQUEST IN THEORY AND THEN PASS ALONG DATE CITY FOR TRANSLATION ATV IS THE ONE THAT HAS TO DO THE TRANSLATION. BECAUSE WE CAN'T BE LIABLE FOR THE TRANSLATION. IF THERE'S ANY DELAY IN TRANSLATION WRESTLING THE REQUIREMENT WE ACTUALLY GET OUR ABILITY ARE PERMITS OPERATE IS SUSPENDED. WHICH IS THE PERMIT WHICH AN OPERATOR GETS TO COLLECT RENT. SO BY NO ACTION OF OUR OWN COULD WE ACTUALLY BE PENALIZED BY THE DEPARTMENT NOT FILLING THE RESPONSIBILITY I'M BY NO MEANS BY THE WAY DO WE FEEL THAT. EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE THE EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS MATERIAL WE ACTUALLY WORK WITH SENATOR PER DIEM WHEN HE PASSED THE ORIGINAL BILL ON THE EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PLAN. BUT WHAT THE BILL IS NOW BEEN AMENDED TO WAS NOT THE FIRST SECTION OF THE END OF THE THIS PLAN WHICH HAS TO DO WITH EVACUATION OF THE PARK. SECTION TO MERELY HAS TO DO WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF AN INDIVIDUAL FOR INSTANCE HAVE YOU NOTICED DO YOU HAVE A PLACE TO GO IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY. DO YOU REMEMBER TO TAKE YOUR MEDICINES HAVE YOU TAKEN YOUR INSURANCE CARD EVERYTHING THAT WHETHER YOUR LIVE IN A MOBILE HOME PARK AN APARTMENT CONDO OR A HOMEOWNER SHOULD ALL HAVE THAT INFORMATION OUR POINT IS ALWAYS BEEN WE ARE TO PROVIDE THE BASICS IN ENGLISH WE PROVIDE. ACCESS TO LET THEM KNOW WHERE TO GET IT BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE THE MOBILE HOME PARKS OPERATOR. TO TELL EVERY RESIDENT EXACTLY THAT THEY NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THEIR EXTRA MEDICINE BECAUSE REALLY THE THE RESIDENTS THE MANAGER THE LIVES IN A PARK IS ALSO A RESIDENT AND THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO GET OUT AND WE WORK WITH PADILLA ON THE BILL. THE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS DID NOT WANT US TO INTERVENE IN ANY OF THIS BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO GIVE PEOPLE A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY THAT THE MOBILE HOME PARK MANAGER OPERATOR IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR SAFETY. IS IN AN EMERGENCY IT TO JUST BE THE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS SO WE DON'T OBJECT TO HAVING MORE INFORMATION WE JUST LEAVE THE INFORMATIONS ALREADY OUT THERE AND THAT THE GOVERNMENT BOTH THE STATE AND FEDERAL OF ALREADY DONE ALL THESE TRANSLATIONS. IN THAT BASIC SECTION TWO AND IT SHOULDN'T BE REDUNDANT FREIGHT CITY TO HAPPEN NOW SPEND MORE MONEY THAN TRANSLATE THESE EXTRA PLANS. THE SERVER MOMMY MAKE SURE INSTANCE OF THE LAW. PARTY REQUIRES AN ENGLISH VERSION OF THE NOTICE TO BE POSTED. AND SO MAYBE I MISUNDERSTAND THIS BILL THIS BILL ALSO REQUIRES. A NOTE THE NOTE THE SAME NOTICE TO BE PUBLISHED IN ANOTHER LANGUAGE GIVEN CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS. AND THE THE BILL REQUIRES. A STATE AGENCY. TO TRANSLATE THE DOCUMENT AND I PRESUME MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO PARK OWNERS AND POSTED ON ITS WEBSITE. AND POSTERS WEBSITE. AND I GUESS THE OPPOSITION IN YOUR COMPLAINT IS THAT. THERE MAY BE A DELAY IN THE TRANSITIONAL ATION IS SOME LIABILITY BECAUSE WE COULD I WOULD SAY I'M ASSUMING THE AUTHOR WITH A CHEST. THE BILL TO RELIEVE THE PARK OWNERS FROM LIABILITY RESPONSIBILITY IF IT'S THE STATE'S PROBLEM AND THAT YOU DON'T GET THE TRANSLATION IN TIME TO POSTED ON THE BOARD. YES THAT'S PART OF IT YEP THE RIGHT. YEAH I'M A FINANCE ARE NOT. OKAY CENTER CABALLERO. IT'S INTERESTING IT SAM IT'S A PRETTY SIMPLE BILL BUT I MIGHT MY ISSUE IS I WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A TWIST ON ALL OF THIS -- APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY I MEAN I I A WAS THE SECRETARY OVER EACH CD. AND QUITE FRANKLY. WE END UP GIVING THESE DUTIES TO DEPARTMENTS THAT DON'T HAVE THE STAFF OR THIRTY OR ABILITY TO DO TRANSLATING SERVICES SINCE WHEN DO WE SEND INFORMATION EACH CD TRANSLATE YOU KNOW IT IT JUST ALL I'D. I'D MUCH RATHER EACH CD MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE BUILDING HOMES IN COMMUNITIES IN A RECALCITRANT IN THAT ARE NOT BUILDING THE RENO NUMBERS THEN TO BE DOING TRANSLATION SERVICES SO I WAS LOOKING AT THIS AND SAYING. WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE CONCERN WAS FROM -- THE MANUFACTURED HOUSING -- POSITIONED BUT I WAS JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY ARE WE SENDING IT TO EACH CD WHEN WHEN IT IT. THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MOBILE HOME -- BUT BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE ARE ANY YEAR TRANSLATION SERVICES. AND THEY THEY MAY BE LOCATED SOMEWHERE ELSE AND AND AND IT JUST SEEMS ODD TO ME. I'M NOT WILLING TO BLOW IT UP TODAY BUT I'M I IT JUST SEEMED ODD. MY REYES FROM THE DISS ASPIRIN DISCUSSED AND OF WHAT WAS SAID -- H. CITY AND ALL YES AND THE REASON THAT WE LEAVE IT WAS -- TO IT'S EIGHT EIGHT DD IS BECAUSE HER SCHOOL THE ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. AND THIS BILL -- THE FACT THIS BILL DO FOR SOFTBALL REQUIRED. THE FIRE MARK A MARSHALL CERTIFIED THE SMOKE DETECTORS ONE PART. AND SUDDENLY TO TRANSLATION PART AND UNCERTAIN THIRD LEAVE VERY IMPORTANT IS FOR THE PARK OWNER TO PROACTIVELY REACH ALL TO THE REST OF THE LET THEM KNOW ABOUT THIS PLAN IS NOT YOUR SOUL I HELP THIS PLAN BARRY SOMEWHERE. YOU KNOW IF YOU INTEREST DEBUT COMMA ABSOLUTE IN THE OLD PORT AT ALL YOU KNOW AND AND DOES IT ALL AND PROVIDE YOU WITH THE ENGLISH VERSION. OR YOU CAN I YOU WERE READING. SO THAT THE THIRD PART IS VERY IMPORTANT IS FOR THE OWNER TO PRO ACTIVELY REACHING OUT TO TO THE RESIDENT TO SAVE OKAY WILL WELCOME YOU TO THE PARK WELL A LOT WARMER LE LET YOU KNOW. ON A REGULAR BASIS SAFETY PLAN IS HAVING A PAPER ON THE BACK WALL DOESN'T DOESN'T GET THERE AND I AND I HAVE TO AGREE YOU KNOW THE KIND OF POSTING THAT YOU DO AS AN EMPLOYER -- YOU PUT HIM UP BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO AND THEY'RE VERY DETAILED AND VERY RARELY ARE THEY READ IF WE REALLY WANT SAFETY. THAN WHAT MAKES SENSE TO ME% RATHER THAN POSTING NOTICES AND DOING IT IN A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT LANGUAGES THAT MAYBE. ONE PASSING THEM OUT MAY BE GOOD BUT IT IT WOULD BE A BOMB TO DO A DRILL ONCE A YEAR WHERE -- EVERYBODY COMES TO THE CLUBHOUSE OR WHEREVER IT IS THAT YOU CAN MEET ON THE FACILITY AND YOU TALK ABOUT WHETHER IT WHAT'S THE PLAN IF THERE'S A FIRE HERE IF IF WE HAD TO EVACUATE QUICKLY. WHAT SHOULD PEOPLE BE DOING WHAT WHERE SHOULD THEY BE LOOKING FOR ASSISTANCE AND IT'S YOUR ABSOLUTE RIGHT IT'S NOT THE PARK MANAGER IT'S IT'S LISTENING TO THE OFFICIALS -- AND AND THAT THAT SEEM TO ME. TO TO BE -- IF IF SAFETY IS OUR REAL ISSUE THEN WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT A WAY FOR US TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE IN IN MANY OF THESE. THESE UNITS THEIR THEIR SENIORS THEY'RE NOT GONNA MOVE VERY FAST THEY'RE NOT THERE'S GOING TO BE CONFUSION -- AND YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY KNOW WHAT THEY NEED TO DO RIGHT AWAY SO THAT THEY CAN GET THEMSELVES TO A PLACE OF SAFETY AWAY FROM. THE THE THE PERSON I WAS GOING TO COME IN AND TRY TO PUT OUT WHATEVER THE DISASTER IS SO THAT. JUST MY TWO CENTS WORTH BUT WE WOULD DO -- SEND OUT COULD COULD STUDIO DAY THE MANAGERS AND THE RESIDENTS ARE COMMUNICATE ON THE WILL MONTHLY BASIS WHEN THEY HAVE TO PAY THE RENT. SO THIS BILL WOULD JUST SAYING THAT ONCE THE ONCE A YEAR. THAT THE MANAGER SHOULD OF INFORM. AND I LET THE RESIDENTS KNOWS ABOUT THIS PLAN. IS AVAILABLE FOR THEM AND THE CLUB HOUSE INTO CAN COME AND READ OF ALL THAT OCCURRED XIN TO DO. OKAY A SINGLE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS -- DO WE HAVE A MOTION. MOVED BY SENATOR ROTH AND TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE YOU YUBA AGAIN THIS THIS IS THE BILLS SAY FLY FOR I ENCOURAGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE BILL DOES ENJOY AND I RECOMMENDATION AND WILL CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS ON THE BILL THREE THIRTY EIGHT BY SIGN NUMBER TO MOTIONS TO PASS AND REFER THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS SENATOR WIENER. I MORAL. MORRELL NO BATES. BATES NO CARRIER. HI DORADO MCGUIRE. WARLOCK [inaudible] ROUGH [inaudible] I SKINNER. NUMBER. NUMBER I BECAUSE HE THE VOTERS FORTY TWO WILL PUT THAT ON CALL FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS. I THINK IT'S CENTERS THANK YOU FOR AND COLORS AS A REMINDER WE DO AT THE END OF EACH. MEETING WE AWARD THE HONORARY -- MIKE MCGUIRE AWARD TO A MEMBER WHO ARRIVES LAST. I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT THERE ARE THREE MEMBERS WHO ARE COMPETING FOR THE HONOR -- THIS TIME THEY ARE SENATORS TO ROSS SO MCGUIRE AND SKINNER AND CENTER MCGUIRE DOES OFTEN WHEN -- THE AWARD THE SAME AFTER HIMSELF. OKAY -- WE WILL -- WE WILL NEXT -- GOOD ITEM NUMBER SEVEN AB FOR THIRTY BY -- SOME MEMBER GALLAGHER. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND SENATORS -- APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT AB FOR THIRTY TO YOU -- AND I KNOW WE WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ON PAGE FIVE OF THE ANALYSIS -- SO THIS IS THE CAMPFIRE HOUSING ASSISTANCE ACT OF TWENTY NINETEEN HI AS YOU ALL KNOW -- WE'VE BEEN THROUGH -- A DEVASTATING DISASTER IN IN OUR COMMUNITY -- WHEN THE CAMP FIRE SWEPT THROUGH AND -- WIPED OUT -- THE TOWN OF PARADISE IN THE COMMUNITIES OF MIGUEL YET CON CAO AND YANKEE HILL -- THE FIRE DISPLACED OVER [inaudible] FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE. I WILL TAKE MANY YEARS -- FOR THESE COMMUNITIES TO REBUILD -- AND IN THE MEANTIME EVACUEES NEED TO BE ABLE TO FIND STABLE HOUSING IN THE REGION -- WHILE SOME NOW AND I BELIEVE A VERY STRONG CONTINGENT WILL RETURN TO PARADISE AND AND REBUILD THAT. TOWN EVEN MORE RESILIENT SAFER INTO THE FUTURES MANY. PEOPLE WILL. MAYBE DECIDED NOT TO REBUILD AND NEED TO THE STAND THE REGION WHERE THEY HAVE FAMILY JOB OPPORTUNITIES THEIR KIDS GO TO SCHOOL. IN THE REGION. BUT THE PROBLEM IS -- AS AS AS WE KNOW WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT WAS. CERTAINLY THE CASE IN BUTTE COUNTY BEFORE AND IT'S EVEN WORSE NOW 14% OF BUTTE COUNTY'S HOUSING STOCK -- WAS DESTROYED -- THE COUNTY FELL SEVENTEEN PLACES MORE THAN ANY OTHER COUNTY IN THE STATE ON THE AFFORDABILITY INDEX. OF THE RENTAL MARKET VACANCY RATE ALSO FELL TO NEARLY. ZERO AFTER THE FIRE -- SO THIS IS ALL MAKING IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. FOR CAN'T FIE VICTIMS AND OTHERS TO FIND HOUSING -- AND SO EIGHTY FOUR THIRTY WOULD PROVIDE A STREAMLINED MINISTERIAL APPROVAL PROCESS FOR BUILDING HOUSING PROJECTS IN IN THE IN THE VALLEY. IN THE BUTTE COUNTY REGION AND IN THE URBAN CENTERS OF THE REGION -- WE THE BILL DOES ONLY APPLY -- IN THOSE URBAN REGIONS WHERE THERE IS BEEN A GENERAL PLAN. DESIGNATION FOR RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT -- IT ALSO INCLUDES PROTECTIONS PREVENTIVE ELEMENTS FROM BEING BUILT. FOR EXAMPLE IN FLOOD PLAINS OR ON LANDS THAT ARE ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE INCLUDING WETLANDS -- AND WHERE THERE IS -- HABITAT. INVOLVING ENDANGERED SPECIES. SO -- I BELIEVE THIS IS A A GOOD AND USEFUL TOOL I AGAIN WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FOR WORKING WITH US -- I THINK THE OPPOSITION THE ONLY OPPOSITION OF THAT HAS BEEN REGISTERED HAD. WAS DEALING WITH THE CITY OF CHICO ONE AB REMOVED WE HAVE DONE THAT -- AND ALSO SOME TALK ABOUT A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE INCLUSIONARY ZONING WHICH THE AMENDMENT. ADDRESSES OF THIS WOULD PRECLUDE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS -- FOR MAKING THEIR OWN DECISIONS TO IN INCLUDE INCLUSIONARY ZONING -- LOCALLY SO AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE WORK ON THIS IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL FOR MY COMMUNITY AND I WOULD ASK. FOR YOUR AYE THE I THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLYMEMBER. FISH MISTER CHAIRMAN VERY BRIEFLY -- PAUL YOU'RE ON BEHALF OF THE BIÃ£U COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL BUT ALSO JUST DON'T WANT TO MISS ANY OPPORTUNITY THINK THIS ENTIRE LEGISLATURE THE NEWSMEN MINISTRATION. FOR ALL THE MANIFESTATIONS OF SUPPORT FOR BI&lt;c.cyan&gt; COUNTY FOR PARADISE.&lt;/c&gt; BILLS LIKE THIS AND ALSO BUT BUDGET ITEMS WE'RE JUST VERY GRATEFUL TRYING TO REBUILD THANK YOU. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. BUT AFTERNOON JOHN KENNEDY WITH THE WORLD COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIANS STRONG SUPPORT WE THINK IT'S A GOOD WAY TO FACILITATE REBUILDING. AND A HARD HAT AREA THANK YOU. YES OVER THERE WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN SUPPORT I'VE ALSO BEEN ASKED TO REGISTER SUPPORT FOR THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION. SILVIO PRIME HAVE THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION AND THE CIVIL JUSTICE CESSATION CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT OKAY OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS RICHARD HERMAN. ON THE GENERAL COUNSEL FOR THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE CENTER. WE'VE SUBMITTED WRITTEN. OPPOSITION. IN IT SHOULD BE IN THE FILE -- WE OPPOSE THIS BILL. THE BILL HAD DOES NOT REALLY DO WHAT IT SAYS IT DOES. THE NEW AMENDMENTS. TO FOUR THIRTY HEAD DO LITTLE OR NOTHING WITH RESPECT TO EXPEDITING CONSTRUCTION. OF HOUSING FOR DISPLACED PER DAY SURVIVORS. IT IS INTENDED TO EXPLOIT THE EMOTIONAL CAMPFIRE DISASTER TO FAST TRACK URBAN SPRAWL DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOUTH SACRAMENTO VALLEY. I SPEAK FROM EXPERIENCE AS SOMEONE WHO IS LITIGATING ON THE PGA ANY CASES. THAT I TALK WITH THE SURVIVORS OF PARADISE ATTEND. AND THE NUMBERS THAT ARE PRESENTED TO YOU ARE MISLEADING. BECAUSE THERE WILL ALREADY NOT BE ANYWHERE NEAR FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT ARE NEEDED. AS FAR AS THE NEED FOR HOUSING. WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIFIC ISSUES OF THE BILL. THE FACTS IN THE BILL ITSELF REALLY DEMONSTRATE THAT IT DOESN'T ADDRESS WHAT IT SAYS IT'S GOING TO ADDRESS. FIRST OF ALL THE DENSITY THAT IS THE MINIMUM DENSITY. OR IS FOUR UNITS PER ACRE. ANOTHER PROVISION IS IT'S ONLY TWO THIRDS OF THE AREA IS FOR RESIDENTIAL SOME OF IT CAN BE MIXED USE. SO IT'S NOT REALLY FOCUSED ON RESIDENTIAL IT'S AFFORDABLE. AND THAT'S ANOTHER PROBLEM. YOUR STAFF ANALYSIS BY MISUSE. TEED UP THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE INHERENT IN THE BILL IT REALLY DOESN'T ADDRESS. AFFORDABLE HOUSING IT DOESN'T ENSURE THAT PARADISE SURVIVORS WILL BE. BUYERS OR RENTERS OF THE HOUSING. AND WHAT IT REALLY DOES WITH A FIFTY ACRE MAXIMUM THAT'S ALLOWED. AT THE RATE OF FOUR UNITS PER ACRE. IF FOR THE MINIMUM DENSITY IN ORDER TO DO IT IT'S NOT REALLY DENSE HOUSING. SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY HAS A THE DWELLING UNIT PER ACRE. AVERAGE IT SHOOTS FOR WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EFFECTIVELY FAST TRACKING URBAN SPRAWL DEVELOPMENT IN THE CELL SACRAMENTO VALLEY. WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS ALREADY THE LARGE SCALE DEVELOPERS NOW COMING UP TO THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY TO START DEVELOPING? OUR OBJECTION IS THAT THE SEQUEL EXEMPTION IS NOT THE NECESSARY. IT'S ALREADY EXISTENCE SEEK WHAT. AND FURTHER MORE WHAT IT DOES IS IT RADICALLY CHANGES THE RATE OF GROWTH THAT WILL BE EXPERIENCED IN THE COMMUNITIES WHICH ARE DESIGNATED. FINALLY TO CLOSE I DID A DRIVE THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT. OF THE ASSEMBLY MAN THE AUTHORS DISTRICT. THESE ARE SMALL TOWNS. THEY DON'T NEED A SEQUEL EXCEPTION TO START MOVING FORWARD. SHE BECAUSE BEEN WITHDRAWN SHE BECAUSE THE ONE THAT IS A ONE IS CAN BE DEALING WITH IT WHAT WE REALLY NEED IS FUNDING FOR PLANNING AND SUPPORT. FOR MORE DENSE DEVELOPMENT IN THE CITY OF CHICO. BY THE WAY OUR ORGANIZATION AND OTHERS THAT I REPRESENTED SUPPORTED EIGHTY USE IN CHICO WE HAVE ADOPTED THAT MEASURE IN THE CITY CHICO SO WE BELIEVE AND DENSITY. OF DEVELOPMENT WE BELIEVE IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND WE SUPPORT THAT. THIS BILL SIMPLY DOES NOT BRING THAT TO THE VALLEY. IT IS ESSENTIALLY GOING TO REPLICATE THE SAME MISTAKES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE AND URBAN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND THE BAY AREA WHERE I GREW UP AND I REALLY WANT TO SEE THAT HAPPEN AGAIN. THE CUMULATIVE IMPACTS IT WILL BE IGNORED BECAUSE OF THE SEEK TO EXEMPTION ARE THE ONES THAT ARE GOING TO LEAD THE WAY TO MORE SPRAWL. THAT WILL LEAD THE WAY TO FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES FOR THE SMALLER COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO EXPAND SO RAPIDLY. WE'RE GOING TO SEE THE SAME KIND OF TRANSPORTATION AIR QUALITY PROBLEMS AND OTHER PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE ALREADY SEEN IN THE PAST WE DON'T NEED TO BE DRIVING A REAR VIEW MIRROR. IN TWENTY NINETEEN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT NOT BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. CRISTINA WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE -- COLLEAGUES ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ON THIS BILL [inaudible] CENTER MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR. FOR SMALL DO APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON THIS BILL ALONG WITH YOUR FANTASTIC TEAM AND I ALSO WANT. TO TAKE A MOMENT TO RECOGNIZE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF FOR HIS HARD WORK ON THIS ISSUE IN OBVIOUSLY ALL ISSUES THE RECOVERY -- UNDERSTAND IT THERE'S BEEN AMENDMENTS TAKEN TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH A SURROUNDING CITIES. THIS. I UNDERSTAND THERE'S CONTINUE CONCERN [inaudible] AND THERE'S NEVER BEEN AN INCIDENT LIKE THIS IN AMERICAN HISTORY NEVER. TO THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF WHAT'S HAPPENED IN PARADISE -- AND I APPRECIATE. YOU BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- IT'S COMMONSENSE IN REGARDS TO THE STREAMLINING -- END WE DON'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF CHOICE. THE QUICKER THEY'RE STILL CLEANING UP IN THAT COMMUNITY THE QUICKER WE CAN START GETTING SIX UP -- IN PEOPLE BACK IN THEIR HOMES THE BETTER IS GOING TO BE AND UNDERSTAND THAT THERE MAY BE CAN YOU CONCERNED BUT I APPRECIATE YOU LOOKING AT ALL AVENUES TO BE ABLE TO MOVE THIS FORWARD. THANK YOU SENATOR. THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR HELP AS WELL ON ON THE MANY ISSUES WHO ARE WORKING ON ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. OKAY -- WITH A MOTION BY SENATOR CABALLERO AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE -- I JUST YOU KNOW ADDRESS SOME OF THE THINGS WERE BROUGHT UP -- YOU KNOW ONE THIS DISC CANNOT ALLOW SPRAWL SPRAWL. PARTICULARLY BECAUSE THIS CAN ONLY BE USED IN THE CITY LIMITS OF INCORPORATED CITIES IN BUTTE COUNTY -- SO THE UNINCORPORATED PARTS THE COUNTY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THIS STREAMLINED PROCESS -- SO AND THE OTHER IN THE OTHER ISSUE IS YOU KNOW THE BIGGEST OPPOSITION WAS FROM THE CITY OF CHICO THEY DID NOT WANT TO BE PART OF THIS SO THEY'VE BEEN REMOVED FROM THE BILL.

START TO LEAVE HIM WITH THAT -- BUT I DO WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR YOUR WORK WITH US ON THIS LEGISLATION AND I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS OUT ONE ON PAGE FOR THE ANALYSIS. TO ALLEVIATE FLEXIBILITY CONCERNS BROUGHT BY LOCALS SO YOU'VE ALL HEARD TODAY I'M SURE OVER AND OVER AGAIN ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT EIGHTY USE ARE AND HOW WHAT A WONDERFUL TOOL THEY ARE. AND WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS ASKS ARE LOCALITIES TO THINK ABOUT EIGHTY USE IN TERMS OF THE WAYS TO HELP FOSTER PUBLIC PRIVATE INVESTMENTS IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO IN LOS ANGELES THE AVERAGE AFFORDABLE HOUSING NIT WAS RUNNING AROUND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A UNIT RIGHT NOW GIVEN LAND COSTS AND ALL OF THE OTHER OSTS OF BUILDING. IT EIGHTY YOU CAN BE BUILT FOR A FRACTION OF THAT COST PLUS YOU'RE UTILIZING PRIVATELY OWNED LAND SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS AS REQUIRE LOCALITIES TO PLAN FOR AFFORDABLE EIGHTY USE. CAN BE LOW INCOME IT CAN BE MODERATE BUT LOOKING FOR WAYS TO PARTNER WITH THE WITH CITIZENS TO SAY. IT WILL YOU'LL LET US AS A CITY TO INVEST IN YOUR PROPERTY WE DON'T TELL THEM HOW TO DO THAT WE COULD ASK THEM TO COME UP WITH THAT THEMSELVES. WILL HELP YOU BUILD THE EIGHTY USES AN AXE AND IN EXCHANGE YOU WRITE YOUR EIGHTY YOU IS AN AFFORDABLE OR LOW INCOME HOUSING FOR X. AMOUNT OF TIME. IT'S A BARGAIN FOR THE FOR THE CITY -- IT GETS PEOPLE INTO A MUCH NEEDED HOUSING AND FOR MANY HOMEOWNERS WILL BE THE ONLY THING THAT WILL HELP WILL ALLOW THEM TO BUILD EIGHTY YOU BECAUSE THEY THEMSELVES MIGHT BE OF MODERATE MEANS OR MODERATE INCOME IN THIS IS A WAY THAT THEY CAN PARTICIPATE. IN EIGHTY USE AS WELL SO WE THINK IT'S A WIN WIN FOR LOCALITIES IT'S CREATING AFFORDABLE HOUSING AT A FRACTION OF THE COST. AND HOPEFULLY CREATING A MORE EIGHTY USE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AND I DON'T THINK I HAVE ANYTHING ELSE ARE WE SUPPOSED TO SAY -- I WE DO HAVE A WITNESS HERE.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU SENATORS -- AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN IS A REGIONAL BAY AREA BILL TO ADDRESS A HOUSING CRISIS IN OUR BEER A REGION. UNFORTUNATELY IT'S A REGION THAT WAS AND CONTINUES TO BE THE EPICENTER OF OUR STATE'S HOUSING CRISIS WITH RECORD HOME PRICES. RECORD RENTS RECORD EVICTIONS AND RECORD LEVELS OF HOMELESSNESS. UNFORTUNATELY THE INDIVIDUAL EFFORTS OF A HUNDRED AND ONE BAY AREA CITIES AND NINE COUNTIES HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ADDRESS THE CRISIS PARTICULARLY AFTER MANY SAW HOUSING STAFF. AND FUNDING GOT IT AROUND THE REGION AFTER THE DISSOLUTION OF REDEVELOPMENT. THIS BILL WOULD ENABLE THE BAY AREA TO HELP ITSELF GIVEN THE NINE COUNTY REGION THE AUTHORITY TO RAISE FUNDING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SIMILAR TO HOW THE REGION HAS LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY TO RAISE FUNDS FOR TRANSPORTATION AND FOR RESTORATION OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY. THE BILL WOULD ALLOW THE REGION TO ASSIST LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IN PLANNING FOR PRODUCTION PRESERVATION AND PROTECTION ASSEMBLE PARCELS AND MONITOR REGIONAL PROGRESS. THE BILL SPECIFIES THAT THE REGION WOULD FIGURE OUT ITS OWN GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE COMPOSED OF MEMBERS FROM THE REGION'S EXISTING GOVERNANCE BODIES THE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. AS WELL AS THE ASSOCIATION OF BAY AREA GOVERNMENTS AND TO SEE IN A BACK. THE BILL PROVIDES A REGION WITH A RANGE OF FUND RAISING TOOL. AND ENABLES REGION TO DETERMINE WHICH REVENUE MEASURES TO PLACE ON THE BALLOT FOR VOTER APPROVAL. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH REGIONAL LEADERS TO DETERMINE THE BEST WAY TO DISTRIBUTE AND EXPEND FUNDS. INCLUDING AN EXISTING WORKING GROUP SET UP BY THE REGIONAL AGENCIES SPECIFICALLY TO PROVIDE INPUT ON THIS LEGISLATION THAT'S EXPECTED TO PROVIDE INPUT BY TE END OF THIS MONTH. THE BEER IS HOUSING CRISIS THREATENS NOT ONLY THE BAY AREA BUT MAJOR ECONOMIC DRIVERS OF THE STATE THIS BILL WOULD EMPOWER OUR REGION TO FIND THE ADDRESS OUR REGIONAL HOUSING CRISIS. WITHOUT PAYMENT A TURN IT OVER TO OUR WITNESSES. GREAT -- SO TO WITNESSES OKAY SO -- WE WOULD ASK THAT YOU KEEP YOUR COMMENTS TO THREE MINUTES EACH THANK YOU. HI I'M GET THE ROW AND I'M WITH THE AND THE PRICE CAN YOU PARTNERS AND WE'RE DELIGHTED TO BE CO SPONSORING THIS BILL -- OUR MISSION IS TO CREATE OPPORTUNITY FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES THROUGH AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND LAST YEAR I CO AUTHORED THIS REPORT IT'S CALLED ELEPHANT IN THE REGION. TURNING THE PATH FOR BAY AREA METRO TO LEAD A BOLD REGIONAL HOUSING AGENDA. IN IN THIS REPORT WE LOOKED AT HOW OTHER REGIONS ARE ADDRESSING THEIR HOUSING AND THEIR DISPLACEMENT CRISIS. AND THE KEY FINDING FROM OTHER REGIONS THAT ARE DOING IT WHILE IS THAT THERE IS A ROBUST HOUSING INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE TWO COMPONENTS OF THAT INFRASTRUCTURE NUMBER ONE IS FUNDING. AND THE SECOND IS THE CAPACITY TO ADMINISTER EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS AND POLICIES AND DEPLOY INNOVATIVE FINANCING. WE'RE INVESTED IN THIS BILL BECAUSE IT'S THE FIRST STEP TO BUILDING THE REGIONAL HOUSING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE NEED IN THE BAY AREA. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE RELIED ON LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO SOLVE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS. AND SO MANY LOCAL HOUSING DEPARTMENTS THEY'VE BANNED ESSENTIALLY GUIDED SINCE THE DISSOLUTION OF REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES. THERE SIMPLY ISN'T ENOUGH OF FUNDING AND THERE'S NOT ENOUGH STAFF FOR EXPERTISE. THIS BILLS AWAY TO HELP JURISDICTIONS. IT'S ALL CARROTS IT'S FUNDING IT'S TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IT'S HELP WITH LAND ASSEMBLY AND DATA CREDIT TRACK TRACKING. THERE ARE NO STICKS OF OF EMINENT DOMAIN OR OR YOU OUR LAND USE AUTHORITY. FOR THE PAST YEAR WE'VE BEEN ENGAGING ON HOUSING DEPARTMENT AND PLANNING DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THE BAY AREA AND WE'VE ASKED HIM HOW CAN THIS BILL HELP YOU. AND THESE ARE THE EXAMPLES THAT THEY PROVIDED AND OUR PRICE. WHEN THE NEXT NATURAL DISASTER HITS DEPLOYING REGIONAL FUNDING TO REBUILD HOMES AND COMMUNITIES? LAND ASSEMBLY TOOLS TO HELP WITH ACTIVATING PUBLIC LAND FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND HOUSING EXPERTISE THAT CAN HELP CREATE EFFECTIVE RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS FOR THOSE FAMILIES THAT ARE FACING DISPLACEMENT -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO MENTION THE AD HOC COMMITTEE. AND THE INTENT OF THAT IS TO FIGURE OUT THE RIGHT GOVERNANCE AND TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE NOT CREATING ANOTHER REGIONAL AGENCY. THIS BILL IS SIMPLY A SET OF TOOLS TO RAISE FUNDS AND TO ENSURE REGIONAL COORDINATION TO ADDRESS THE WORST HOUSING CRISIS IN THE COUNTRY. SO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND WE DRAPER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF A GOOD AFTERNOON SURE WINNER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE PATRICK OUT PHONE WITH THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE ARE FORTY YEAR OLD FOR DOUBLE HOUSING ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION THAT BELIEVES THAT EVERYONE IN THE BAY AREA SHOULD HAVE AN AFFORDABLE AND STABLE PLACE TO CALL HOME. AND WE BELIEVE THAT AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WILL MOVE US MUCH CLOSER INTO MAKING THAT VISION A REALITY -- BY PROVIDING REGION SPECIFIC BY ADDRESSING A REGION SPECIFIC HOUSING NEEDS BY DEVELOPING YOU FUNDING AND PROGRAMS. AND SO AB FOURTEEN NINETY SEVEN AS I MENTION WILL PROVIDE CRITICAL YOU FUNDING TO ADDRESS THE THREE PIECE OF HOUSING SPECIFICALLY -- TEN PROTECTIONS HOUSING PRESERVATION AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION -- AS YOU ALL KNOW WITH THE DISSOLUTION OF REDEVELOPMENT IN TWENTY TWELVE WE HAVE WE SAW A HUGE. AMOUNT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUNDING VANISHING TO ENTERTAIN AIR IN THE BAY AREA ALONE WE LOST ABOUT A QUARTER BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN DEDICATED FUNDING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WILL MAKE THAT -- WILL HELP US RECOUP SOME OF THOSE LOSSES. THIS IS THESE ARE SOLUTIONS THAT ARE WIDELY SUPPORTED BY BAY AREA RESIDENTS IN POLLING THAT WAS CONDUCTED BY EMC RESEARCH IN LATE APRIL -- THERE IS SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT AMONG VOTERS CONCERNED ABOUT LOW INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED FAMILIES BEING ABLE TO FIND AN AFFORDABLE PLACE TO LIVE. THREE OUT OF FUR VOTERS AGREED THAT WE NEED TO REGIONAL APPROACH TO HOUSING THAT IN THE BAY AREA NOT SIMPLY CITY BY CITY POLICIES. AND THE SENTIMENT IS WIDESPREAD GEOGRAPHICALLY IT WITH AGREEMENT ABOVE A MAJORITY IN EVERY COUNTY AND ABOVE 70% IN ALAMEDA MARIN SAN FRANCISCO AND SAN MATTEO CONTRA COSTA AND SANTA CLARA COUNTIES. THE RESEARCH SHOWED AND OVERWHELMING CONCERN AND THAT CALIFORNIANS. BEING FORCED TO LEAVE THE STATE DUE. TO OVERWHELMING HOUSING COSTS. AND SO. I DON'T HAVE MUCH TO ADD MORE TO THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THE BILL OTHER THAN THAT THIS WILL PROVIDE MORE CRITICALLY NEEDED FUNDING COORDINATION ACROSS THE BAY AREA. AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. MIKE LEMON SILICON VALLEY AT HOME IN STRONG SUPPORT. TO DAVID BAY AREA HOUSING I'M SIXTY COALITION SUPPORT. ERIN EVANS ON BEHALF OF THE SILICON VALLEY SKEWS ME ON BEHALF OF HABITAT FOR HUMANITY OF THE EAST BAY SILICON VALLEY AS WELL AS HIM TO PARTNERS AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. MELISSA WARNER THE SILICON VALLEY COMMUNITY FOUNDATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. LOUIS MANTE WITH CALIFORNIA INDIANS TRANSPORT -- ANYMORE ON BEHALF OF BRIDGE HOUSING ALSO IN SUPPORT. NICCOLO DELUCA HERE BEHALF OF TWO MAYORS HE'LL TO MAYOR LIBBY SCHAAF IN SUPPORT OF THE OF AND THEN THE BERKELEY MARRIAGES HERE AGAIN IN SUPPORT APPRECIATE. ALL THE CHANGES AT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER IN HIS OFFICE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON SO THANK YOU. CHRIS ROSA ON BEHALF OF THE SILICON VALLEY LEADERSHIP GROUP IN SUPPORT. OKAY ANY ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION. SAY NON WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS COLLEAGUES CENTER WHAT CAL SKI THE I GUESS THE CONCERN IS THE EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF THE FUNDS -- INNOVATIVE ALAMEDA COUNTY TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION HAS LODGED IN OPPOSITE OPPOSITION THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT 50% OF THE MONEY BEING REGIONAL THERE'S THAT EXPECTATION OR ARE BEING DISTRIBUTED. REGIONALLY ALSO HAVING A BAG AS A HAVE A LARGER SHARE -- NONE OF THESE NINETY THERE'S NO AMENDMENTS SO AS WONDER IF YOU COULD. ANSWER THAT CONCERN THE PEOPLE HAVE SINCE I DON'T REPRESENT THE SITTING COUNTY SAN FRANCISCO SAN AT WERE OAKLAND SO I HAVE WORRIED ABOUT THOSE OTHER SMALLER CITIES. SO WILL ANSWER THE QUESTION IN TWO SEPARATE WAYS THERE REALLY ISSUES RUN GOVERNANCE OF WHO RUNS IT AND THEN THERE'S THE ISSUE OF OF WHERE THE MONEY GOES. SO AS FAR AS A GOVERNANCE ISSUE -- WE HAVE -- WE HAVE ESSENTIALLY SUGGESTED THAT A COMMITTEE OF MTC IN A BAG THAT IS MEETING AB WE SPEAK THEY WORK OUT WHAT THEY THINK IS APPROPRIATE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. TO THEN BE PROPOSED TO MISTER REQUIRES COMMITTEE AND THAT'S THE HOPE OF WORKING THIS OUT IN THE CHALLENGES SO WE EXPLAINED -- THE MTC AS WE KNOW -- IS VIEWED AS BEING A BIT MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF LARGER CITIES A BAG IS BEING VIEWED AS A BIT MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF SMALLER SUBURBAN CITIES IT'S SORT OF LIKE ASKING THE HOUSE AND SENATE. IN CONGRESS TO KIND OF FIGURE OUT HOW TO BEST FIGURE THIS OUT THAT'S A WE'VE ASKED THEM TO DO WHEN THEY COME OUT BACK WE WILL. VERY LIKELY ASKED TO ADOPT THAT A MISTER REQUIRES COMMITTEE AS FAR AS WHERE THE MONEY'S GOING TO OF THIS IS ALSO BEEN -- AN ONGOING DIALOGUE WITH DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS -- THERE ARE A LOT OF JURISDICTIONS THAT WOULD LIKE AS MUCH MONEY TO RETURN TO SOURCE AS POSSIBLE -- AND THAT WOULD PREFER TO SEE YOU KNOW MORE THAN 75% OF THE MONEY GOING BACK TO THE ORIGINAL COUNTIES WHERE THE MONEY'S REGENERATOR FROM. ON THE OTHER HAND I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT THE AFORDABLE HOUSING COMMUNITY AND CITIES THAT ARE READY TO BILL TODAY WOULD PREFER THERE TO BE A REGIONAL POT SO FOR EXAMPLE NUMBER CLOSER 250%. WE DECIDED TO HIT THE BALL DOWN THE MIDDLE BY PROPOSING THAT 75% OF THE MONEY RETURNED BACK TO THE COUNTIES -- BUT THAT. QUESTION IS ALSO BEING LOOKED AT VERY CAREFULLY AT THIS MOMENT BY AND TO SEE IN A BAG AND AGAIN WE'RE EXPECTING POTENTIALLY SOME MORE NUANCED. RECOMMENDATIONS IN THAT AREA SO -- THAT'S THE DETAILED ANSWER THANK YOU [inaudible] REQUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO TALK WITH THE SOMEONE OVER THERE TODAY WE CAN BE GETTING TOGETHER TOMORROW TO GET A TALK ABOUT GETTING TO BILLS -- FOURTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN SEVENTEEN SIXTY THREE IN NO IN THIS AND THAT WE DISCUSSED HERE TODAY AT SINCE WERE. HAVING THOSE OPEN CONVERSATIONS LIKE I SAY THERE ARE VERY FEW PEOPLE ARE AS GOOD AS A SENT OVER THERE TO WORK WITH I AM VERY GRATEFUL FOR ALL HIS HARD WORK -- GOING TO BE. NOT VOTING ON BOTH OF THE BILL SO WE CAN WORK THIS OUT PRIOR TO GETTING CONFERENCE IN FINANCE AND APPRECIATE ALL HIS HARD WORK. OKAY OFTEN -- CABALLERO. PADRES FOR MISSING -- PART OF THE PRESENTATION BUT I DO APPRECIATE THAT THE LATEST THE X. EXPLANATION THE TICKET RIGHT NOW ENTERED THE TURN TO THE GOVERNMENT -- IN REAP REALIZE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GO OVERTO ANOTHER COMMITTEE IN THE IN THE SENATE -- THAT'S PROBABLY WHERE I WOULD HAVE FOCUSED A LOT OF MY QUESTIONS ON BUT I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE WERE CREATING ANOTHER ENTITY. THAT ON THAT DAY THEN -- READ YOU KNOW COMES UP WITH THE WITH THE PLAN AND HOW THE MONEY SHOULD BE SPENT AND THEN. PAYS THEMSELVES RIGHT WE WANT AS MUCH MONEY AS POSSIBLE GOING TOWARDS THE CREATION AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SO I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S WORK AND I ALSO APPRECIATE. IT WHEN SHE'S YOU GENERATE REVENUE WHERE IT GOES BECOMES A REAL CHALLENGE REGIONALLY SO HI I'M I MEAN IT'S PRETTY BILL TODAY AND WE'LL SEE HOW IT COMES OUT OF THE NEXT COMMITTEE IN THE SENATE. BUDGET THAT THANK YOU. CENTER MORE LOCK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THE SEVEN CHIU IN ORANGE COUNTY WE HAVE -- SEE COG ORANGE COUNTY COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS. AND IT'S A SUB REGIONAL PLANNING OPPORTUNITY. FOR THE SUPERVISORS AND THIRTY FOUR CITIES ARE ABOUT. THERE'S ALSO THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF GOVERNMENTS RECALLS GAG ALSO REGIONAL. HOW WOULD YOUR PROPOSAL COMPARED TO THOSE TWO IF YOU IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THEM? SO I'M I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE SPECIFICS OF YOUR ORANGE COUNTY ENTITIES BUT WHEN I REFER TO SOME OF THE BAY AREA ACRONYMS OF A BAG AN MTC. THOSE ARE TWO REGIONAL BODIES -- THAT REPRESENT CITIES BUT IN SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAYS -- AND THE MTC IS KNOWN AS BEING A LITTLE BIT MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF LARGER MORE URBAN CITIES IN A BAG IS A BIT MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF SMALLER SUBURBAN CITIES. WHAT I WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE BASS THOSE TWO ENTITIES TO WORK TOGETHER ON A JOINT COMMITTEE TO PROPOSE FINAL AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL? SO WHAT I REFER TO AS THAT PROCESS -- IT SHOULD COME TO A CLOSE IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS IN TIME TO PUT AMENDMENTS INTO -- CENTER MAGUIRE'S COMMITTEE FOR FOR CONSIDERATION BUT THE IDEA IS TO REALLY MERGE ALL OF THOSE -- THOSE INTERESTS TOGETHER -- THE OTHER THING I WANT TO SAY AND I AND THIS PARTIALLY RESPONSE TO CENTER COPIERS POINT WE'RE NOT TRYING TO ESTABLISH AN ENTIRELY NEW ENTITY IF WE CAN AT ALL -- ACHIEVE THAT -- RIGHT NOW A BAG AND TO SEE OR ENGAGE IN CONVERSATIONS POTENTIALLY TO MERGE SOME OF THEIR FUNCTIONS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE HOUSING ISSUES BUT THE REALITY IS WE DO NOT HAVE AN ENTITY. IN THE BAY AREA THAT IS FOCUSED ON HOUSING AND THE WAY THAT WE NEED TO WE DON'T HAVE AN ENTITY IN THE BAY AREA. THAT CAN ALLOW US TO REALLY PROVIDE THE SELF HELP ME THAT WE NEED TO DO. IN THE WAY THAT WE ALREADY HAVE IN THE BAY AREA WHEN IT COMES TO TRANSPORTATION AND SAN FRANCISCO BAY RESTORATION AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR WITH THIS BILL. AND I WAS MT A AND EIGHT MTC METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION AND AB A BAG IS A CESSATION OF BAY AREA GOVERNMENTS. BECAUSE HE CAN'T HAVE ENOUGH -- ACRONYMS YEAH NO I'M I'M GONNA DO SOME RESEARCH ON THAT. DO YOU KNOW HOW THEY WERE FORM WHERE THEY DONE THROUGH LEGISLATION OR WERE THEY JUST TODAY THEY DOES THAT. MEAN -- SERVE OUR AND SO -- SO THE MTC -- IS THE MPO METROPOLITAN PLANNING ORGANIZATION FOR THE BAY AREA -- WHICH HAS HISTORICALLY FOCUSED ON TRANSPORTATION A BA IS THE COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS OKAY I THINK IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THEY TEND TO BE COMBINED. INTO ONE ENTITY AND THE AND THE BAY AREA -- THEY'VE NOT BEEN WHICH HAS CAUSED SOME. CHALLENGES AND REDUNDANCY AND SO THAT'S WHY THE TWO ORGANIZATIONS ARE -- DISPENSED. A SEMI MERGER OF STAFF -- AND SO -- WE STILL AS WE OFTEN DO WE DO A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY IN THE IN THE BAY AREA -- AND I APOLOGIZE RESTRICT TRYING TO GET THE CONTEXT BECAUSE I I SEE. A HUNDRED ONE CITIES WHICH IS PHENOMENAL IT'S THAT BIG DUMB. AS HE NINE COUNTIES THAT'S THAT'S AN AMAZING. TASK BUT I DON'T SEE THEM ON THE LIST OF SUPPORTERS SO I'VE. I WOULD EXPECT TO SEE A COUPLE PAGES OF CITY NAMES. AND SO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT -- SO WHY NOT BE A VOLUNTARY JPA AS OPPOSED. TO COMING HERE. SO. THIS CAME OUT OF A OF A BROAD BASED REGIONAL PROCESS -- AND AND THIS IS ONE OF A SERIES OF RECOMMENDATIONS -- I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR CARRYING THIS PARTICULAR -- ONE AND AND SO IT DOES HAVE A LOT OF SUPPORT BUT AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF POLITICS AROUND. A HOUSING IN THE BAY AREA AND SO IT'S IT'S COMPLEMENT IT'S COMPLICATED -- BUT THERE IS A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR THIS IDEA I THINK WHAT I WOULD SAY ALSO SAY YOU DON'T SEE THE CITY'S INDIVIDUALLY BEING LISTED AS SUPPORTERS YOUR OPPONENTS BECAUSE THEY ARE WORKING THROUGH EITHER A BACKER THE MTC. AND SO THEY'RE WORKING ON AMENDMENTS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO PROVIDE TO TO US TO CENTER MCGUIRE -- TO CONSIDER FOR THE NEXT COMMITTEE. AND THAT NEXT MEDIA'S GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE CORRECT SO I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU'RE GOING TO GET TO MCGUIRE BUT BUT I'M NOT GOING TO COMMENT ON THAT. STATE OUT OF THAT. ONE BUT I I WILL DO SOME RESEARCH IN THE MEANTIME SO I CAN GET. YOU KNOW COMPARISON BASED ON MY PERSON AT THE STATE -- BECAUSE A I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT ARE WE CREATING A NEW BUREAUCRACY WHICH I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A GOOD IDEA OR OR SOCIAL IF YOU GET IF YOU HAVE SOME. ANSWER THE QUESTION AROUND THE IDEA OF ANY BUREAUCRACY IT IS NOT OUR INTENT TO CREATE A NEW BUREAUCRACY -- IT IS OUR HOPE THAT -- POTENTIALLY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT COULD GET GET SUBSUMED UNDER WHAT -- YOUR YOUR CHAIRMAN HAS DESCRIBED AS THE THE MERGING OF AND TO SEE AN A BACK WE ALSO HAVE IN THIS BILL A LIMITATION ON ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF 3% SO ANOTHER IS 97%. OF ALL THE FUNDING THAT IS REYES THROUGH THIS WOULD GO OUT TO COUNTIES. OUT TO CITIES TO BE USED FOR ADDRESSING THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS TO THAT WAS ONE WAY WHICH WE REALLY CAP TO ENSURE WE'RE NOT TRYING TO CREATE A BIG BUREAUCRACY THAT'S THE LAST THING THAT I WANT TO DO HERE -- BUT WE ARE GIVING THE pITSELF BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS AND I WOULD SAY TO MEMBERS AND SENATORS WHO DO NOT REPRESENT. THE BAY AREA AN ADVANTAGE OF SUPPORTING THIS BILL IS IF WE ARE SUCCESSFUL THE BAY AREA AT HELPING TO ADDRESS OUR FORTY HOUSING CRISIS. WE WOULD CREATE LESS OF A BURDEN OR COMPETITION FOR DOLLARS ON GENERAL FUND DOLLARS THAT THAN OTHER PARTS THE STATE WOULD WOULD HAVE -- BETTER ACCESS TO SO THAT IS ANOTHER. SUGGESTION AS TO WHY HOPE YOU MIGHT SUPPORT THIS BILL AS OUR SO PROBABLY LATE OFF TODAY AND THEN. DO SOME MORE RESEARCH FOR GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE AND IF CENTER REQUIRED DOESN'T GIVE YOU ENOUGH PUSH BACK LET ME KNOW ALL HELP OUT. WELCOME TO HOUSING COMMITTEE IS. AGAIN NO COMMENT ON THAT COLLOQUY [inaudible] OKAY -- SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU. ARM IT IS SOMEONE NUMBER TWO WHAT IS THE AND YOU MAY HAVE ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS BUT IN SEE IN THE ANALYSIS BUT IS THERE A LIMITATION IN THE BILL ON THE PERCENT OF FUNDS THAT CAN BE USED FOR STAFFORD MINISTRATION. WE JUST I JUST MENTION IT TO US AND WE'RE LIKE 3%. AND THAT STAFF TO THIS IS ALL ADMINISTRATIVE I'M JUST LOOKING MY STUFF ALL MINISTRY EXPENSES STAFF INCLUDED. OKAY BECAUSE THE THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL SHOWS THAT THEY CAN USE SEVENTY CNA BACK STAFF BUT THEY CAN ALSO HIRE STAFF AND SO -- BEGIN MIGHT -- WHEN THIS CONCEPT WAS FIRST PROPOSED BY THE FOLKS IN THE BAY AREA WHO WERE ON? COMING UP WITH THE A WHOLE HOST OF POLICIES THAT COULD HELP ADDRESS OUR HOUSING CRISIS. THIS IS THE ONE THAT I WAS THE MOST SKEPTICAL ABOUT BECAUSE I FELT THAT. WE DON'T NEED TO CREATE A NEW BUREAUCRACY THAT WHILE YES THERE'S NOT A SINGLE ENTITY FOR HOUSING IN THE BAY AREA THERE ARE CERTAINLY -- EVERY LOCAL GOVERNMENT DOES HAVE ITS RESPONSIBILITY AND UNDER LOTS OF STATE LAWS WHETHER THEY ARE MEETING THOSE OR NOT IS A DIFFERENT STORY BUT THEY DO HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY. AND I WAS CONCERNED THAT BY THE TIME SOMETHING NEW GOT ESTABLISHED AND THEN MONEY WAS COOL I MEAN THAT YEAH YOU KNOW THOUSAND CRISIS IS NOW. IT'S NOT A AT FIVE YEARS FROM NOW. AND CONSTRUCTION TAKES SO LONG SO -- I HAVE BEEN DEEPLY SKEPTICAL I WAS ALSO THE WAY IT WAS EVER NATIONALLY PRESENTED NOT THE LANGUAGE IN YOUR BILL THAT. PERHAPS THE SALES TAX MEASURE WHICH I COMPLETELY OPPOSE FOR THIS PURPOSE BECAUSE SALES TAX IS ONE OF THE MOST REGRESSIVE. TAX MEASURES AND IT IS THOSE PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE MOST HIT BY SALES TAX WHO SUPPOSEDLY MIGHT BENEFIT FROM. THIS -- IS THE FINANCING AUTHORITY THAT THIS WOULD CREATE. NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S POTENTIALLY OTHER -- REVENUE MEASURES THAT ARE BEING CONSIDERED AND I UNDERSTAND ALSO THAT SALES TAXES BEEN EXCLUDED FROM THIS -- I STILL HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT REVENUE MEASURES WOULD BE -- PURSUED ON LET ME SAY MORTON CONCERNS I'D SAY RATHER THAT I HAVE BIASES AS TO WHICH I THINK SHOULD BE AND WHICH SHOULDN'T -- BUT BY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THIS WERE GIVING THE AUTHORITY TO THAT INTO DE DETERMINED THAT AND OF COURSE THEN THE VOTERS TO APPROVE BUT BECAUSE I DO REALIZE THAT WE NEED. ADDITIONAL FUNDING SOURCES ESPECIALLY IN THE BAY AREA UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE WE HAVE THE HIGHEST COST OF CONSTRUCTION OF ANYWHERE -- THAT. IF YOU KNOW ADDITIONAL WAYS TO GENERATE REVENUE IN ORDER TO COVER THE COSTS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IS A LEGITIMATE. ISSUE SO I WILL -- LOOK FORWARD TO SOME GOOD AMENDMENTS IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE THAT ADDRESS SOME OF THE CITIES IN AREAS CONCERNS -- AND I WILL -- WHAT I CALL IT I WILL DO A WILLING SUSPENSION OF? DISBELIEF IN TERMS OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN WITH THIS AND SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY IN TERMS OF THE CONCERNS I'VE HAD IN THE PAST. OKAY -- SEEN OTHER COMMENTS I JUST WANNA AGAIN THANK THE SUMMER FOR CARRYING THIS BILL -- ANYTHING LIKE THIS IS GOING TO BE OF SOME OF ALL CONTROVERSY SO APPRECIATE YOUR MOVING THROUGH THAT. I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF YOU -- AS YOU MOVE TO THE GOVERNOR TO FINANCE COMMITTEE BECAUSE KEEP OUR HOUSING COMMITTEE STUFF IN THE LOOP -- ON THIS -- BILL -- AND IN PARTICULAR I KNOW THAT THERE IS A PUSH I SEE IN A LETTER FROM ALAMEDA COUNTY TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION FOR EXAMPLE -- WHICH I'M SURE -- REFLECTS THE VIEWS OF THE SMALL CITIES ARE NOT ALL BUT MANY OF THE SMALL CITIES IN ALAMEDA COUNTY. BOB BASICALLY PUSHING TO SHIP THIS OF THE SMALL CITIES WOULD MAKE ALL THE DECISIONS ABOUT IT -- THERE AND SO THAT THE FEES WOULD BE GENERALLY PAID BY THE BIG CITIES AND THEN SPENT ON THE SMALL CITIES AND NOT REALLY RIDICULOUS -- MEMONS HAS TO BE QUITE FRANK AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT AS WE GO THROUGH THE MEMBER PROCESS -- THAT -- THAT. KIND OF THINKING DOESN'T GET ON MOMENTUM -- THERE ARE SOME WHO -- IT'S IN THE BAY AREA US IN THE SMALLER -- CITIES -- THAT ARE MORE BEDROOM COMMUNITIES -- WILL POINT TO THE BIG CITIES LIKE OAKLAND SAN FRANCISCO. AND SAID IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT FOR CREATING A LOT OF JOBS -- AND WE'RE GOOD BECAUSE WE DIDN'T CREATE A LOT OF JOBS AND OF HOUSING -- BUT OF COURSE THERE RESIDENTS WORK IN THE CITY'S -- THAT HAVE JOBS AND SO I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT HIS REGIONALLY -- AMPLE WITH A COPY OUGHT -- THE SUCH ENJOYING AYE RECOMMENDATION. AND WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. I JUST WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION ON THIS I KNOW THIS IS HARD. WE'RE IN A CRISIS AND SO THE IDEA IS HOW CAN WE AS A REGION THAT WE HEAR FROM MANY OF OUR MEMBERS ARE COLLEAGUES OUTSIDE OF THE REGION WHY CAN'T WE HELP OURSELVES IN ADDRESSING. THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE AND THAT'S THE POINT OF OF THIS BILL TO GIVE THE REGION THE ABILITY TO TO SORT OF DETERMINE OUR FATE AND HOPEFULLY -- DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO -- TO LIFT OURSELVES OUT OF THE CRISIS AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU TO SOLVE OUR STATE HOUSING CRISIS SO. OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS OUTLOOK FOR TWO ASSUMING THIS MOVES FOR FROM THIS COMMITTEE -- THE CONTINUE CONVERSATION BUT CERTAINLY LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGE WITH ALL OF YOU ON THIS AND WITHOUT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU AND I BELIEVE CENTER LIKE CAL SKI AS HE WAS WALKING OUT MADE A MOTION SO WE HAVE A MOTION MY CENTER LIKE HEALTHY -- AND WITHOUT -- WE WILL CALL THE ROLL.

SEVENTEEN SIXTY THREE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF FIRST I WANT TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE MOMENTS AND APPRECIATE -- YOU YOUR FEEDBACK AND STAFF FEEDBACK ON THEM -- THIS IS A BILL THAT IN THE MIDST OF OUR HOUSING CRISIS WOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DENSITY BONUSES FOR A 100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS. OR BILL IS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS A FEW CHALLENGES FIRST THE FACT THAT ZONING IS OFTEN A BARRIER TO HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. AND EXISTING ZONING. IS OFTEN TOO LOW FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS TO PENCIL OUT. CERTAINLY WE ALL KNOW HOW SCARCE FOR WHAT HOUSING FUNDING AS AND WE NEED TO STRETCH EVERY DOLLAR TO BUILD MORE UNITS -- THE THIRD CHALLENGE WE ARE TRYING TO ASSIST THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER COMMUNITY WITH IS IN COMPETING WITH MARKET RATE DEVELOPERS. FOR LAND WHERE WE KNOW MORE DENSITY CAN HELP MAKE A PROJECT FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE AND GIVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS HOW 2% AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR ADDITIONAL DENSITY BONUSES ABOVE EXISTING ZONING DENSITY. AND GIVEN THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND EQUITY BENEFITS OF LOCATING HOUSING YOUR TRANSIT A 100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT YOUR TRANSIT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR UNLIMITED DENSITY BONUSES PLUS AN INCREASE IN FIGHT OR FLOOR AREA RATIO IS. UP TO A LIMIT -- AND WITH THAT WANT TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR WITNESS -- MISTER APRIL. THANK YOU SIMPLY NUMBER TWO MY NAME IS RAY PEARL. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM.

THIS BILL SEEKS TO REDUCE OBSTACLES TO BUILDING A 100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS. THESE ARE PROJECTS WERE EVERY SINGLE UNIT REPRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO HOUSE A CALIFORNIA FAMILY. THAT CAN A POOR AFFORD TO PAY RISING RENTS. THE BILL WOULD HELP MAKE MORE OF THESE PROJECTS POSSIBLE. AND AT LOWER COSTS. WITH HOUSING PRICES AND RENTS ONLY GOING UP WE KNOW HOW DESPERATELY LEGISLATION LIKE THIS IS NEEDED. THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE OF IN SOME OF THE LEGISLATURE'S BIGGEST CHAMPIONS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND YOU KNOW WELL THAT IN SPITE OF ALL THAT WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED TOGETHER CALIFORNIA FOR STILL FACES A SHORTAGE OF ONE POINT FOUR MILLION. AFFORDABLE RENTAL HOMES.

AND THE OTHER STAFF. WE DO AGREE THAT WHEN YOU TAKE A HARD LOOK AT AS A BONUS LAW THEN PERHAPS WE NEED TO ADJUST IT -- IS 80% YOU KNOW THE RIGHT NUMBER HOW TO GET SOMETHING. YOU KNOW WORK WORDS STILL LOOKING AT I THINK WE'RE WE HAVE CONCERNS IS THE UNLIMITED DENSITY ANY ADDITIONAL HEIGHTS. AROUND TRAIN STOPS AND BUS STOPS AND BUS CORRIDORS AND WE'VE HAD THOSE CONCERNS WITH SOME OF THE OTHER BILLS. THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH -- THESE COMMITTEES AND WE HAVEN'T QUITE LANDED AS A LEGISLATURE AND AS A NO STAKEHOLDERS ON WHAT THE RIGHT SOLUTION IS. AND WE CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE. TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION AND TAKE A MORE HOLISTIC LOOK AT WHAT SHOULD STAY GOALS BE AROUND TRAINS AND BUS STOPS AND BOWS CORRIDORS -- AND WE WOULD HAVE WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT YOU'RE SEPARATED I'M FROM THIS MEASURE BUT WE CERTAINLY WANT TO CONTINUE TO TALK TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER IN HIS SPONSORS AND AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET THERE -- BECAUSE DANCING ABOUT A CERTAINLY IS A VERY POWERFUL TOOL AND IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A PROBABLY SHOULD GET A LITTLE BIT MORE. IN WITH THAT WITH RESPECT RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE LAST MINUTE. AN ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION. AFTERNOON CURE ROSS ON BEHALF OF THE CITIES OF BURBANK IN SAN MARCOS ACT WHEN THE CONCERNS THE LEAGUE OF CITIES. JOHNSON CLAIMED THAT THE CITY EVEN SENATORS ALSO IN OPPOSITION ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION. OKAY SIGNAL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE -- MOTION BY SENATOR ROSS AND CENTER MORE LOOK. THANK YOU RESEARCHER I JUST HAD -- QUICK QUESTION AND THAT IS -- WHAT WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT PARKING -- IT WELL WE ARE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE MINUTES ABOUT ELIMINATING PARKING FOR SPECIAL NEEDS HOUSING IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE QUESTIONS ABOUT I APOLOGIZE. FOR SOME CHIU WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT PARKING IN FIRE SAFETY CONCERNS AND CONGESTION AND STREETS AND ALL THE REST AND I I I I SHOULD HAVE PRACTICED IT A LITTLE BIT MORE I APOLOGIZE. I'VE BEEN IMMERSED TODAY AND WE WERE JUST WONDERING ALSO WHY JASON HASN'T BEEN HERE ONCE UNTIL NOW. SO THERE'S NOTHING IN THE BILL EXCEPT FOR WHAT I JUST MENTION AS FAR AS THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT HAVE TO DO A PARKING SO SPECIFICALLY. THE BILL WELL THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE ARE ACCEPTING FROM THIS COMMITTEE WOULD ELIMINATE PARKING REQUIREMENTS FOR SPECIAL NEEDS HOUSING AND SUPPORT OF HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS -- THAT MAKE A 100% OF THE UNITS AFFORDABLE TO LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS AND OBVIOUSLY THE THE THE IDEAS FOR THOSE PARTICULAR -- COMMUNITY SOME PROJECTS -- PARKING IS LESS NECESSARY. THANK YOU IN. DO YOU HAVE ANY RESPONSE. NO I WOULD I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THE THIS BILL DOESN'T CHANGE THE THE THE PARKING SITUATION WITHIN SEE BONUS LAW -- YOU KNOW NAY EVERY IF IT IF AT A DEVELOPER IS GOING TO AGREE TO A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF VENOM RAVEN HUSBAND ME A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF AFFORDABILITY THAN THEIR SOME CONCESSIONS BUT THE PARKING WITH INTENSITY BONES LÃ  CERTAINLY REASONABLE. AND AND WE WOULDN'T OBJECT -- TO THE COMMITTEES MOMENT. THANK YOU. AND IF THE CAR BY SINCE THE MOMENT TO COME FROM THE COMMITTEE. WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT LIMITED SUBSET OF HOUSING -- THE THE CHANCES OF THOSE RESIDENTS ARE GOING -- TO ON A CAR IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER -- AND TO IMPOSE THAT KIND OF DRAMATIC COST. ON TO THESE PROJECTS FOR A POPULATION IT'S MUCH LESS LIKELY TO HAVE A CAR -- JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE BUT IT'S A VERY NARROW SUBSET OF THESE PROJECTS. ANY ADDITIONAL CENTER CABALLERO. VERY MUCH -- I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A COUPLE OF THINGS -- IN ARE GENERALLY -- TRIED TO STAY AWAY FROM A 100% AFFORDABLE UNITS BECAUSE OF THE OVER CONCENTRATION THAT CAN OCCUR WHEN YOU PUTTING -- A LOT OF POOR PEOPLE ON ONE PLACE TO HAVE A SIZE LIMITATION IN TERMS OF OF YOUR CONCEPT OF OF AND THEN LET ME JUST PREFACE IT BY SAYING. I SUPPORT. ALL THE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR BILL I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. NUMBER ONE IF IF THERE'S IF THERE IS IF YOU ANTICIPATE SOME SIZE LIMITATION ON THE ON THE SIZE OF A PROJECT NUMBER. ONE NUMBER TWO IS. IF YOU'VE THOUGHT ABOUT HOW THIS WORKS WITH CITIES THAT HAVE EXISTING DENSE -- INCLUSIONARY HOUSING ORDINANCES WHICH SOMETIMES INCLUDE DENSITY BONUSES IF YOU'RE BUILDING AFFORDABLE UNITS AS WELL -- AND THEN ALSO THE IMPACT ON REAL COMMUNITY SO THAT THE THREE THE THREE THINGS THAT I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT AND I'M NOT SURE I HAVE AN ANSWER SO I'M WONDERING IF YOU DO. SO CENTER I'LL TAKE ONE OF THOSE DEALS WITH THE THE TYPE OF CONSTRUCTION. AND ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT THE CHASE AND BROUGHT UP ABOUT. THE HEIGHT. OF THE BULK OF WHAT. AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS BUILD IS STICK CONSTRUCTION VERSUS STEEL CONSTRUCTION AND WHAT THAT ESSENTIALLY MEANS IS MOST EFFICIENT USE OF THE LAND IN A 1100% AFFORDABLE PROJECT. IS GOING TO BE FIVE TORIES ARE LESS. AND SO THAT IS A VERY BIG COMPONENT OF WHAT OUR DEVELOPERS LOOK LOOK LOOK. FOR AND AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU MENTIONED PART OF WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS ALLOW. AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS TO COMPETE WITH MARKET RATE DEVELOPERS MAKING IT A MUCH MORE LEVEL PLAYING FIELD ON THE TYPE OF HOUSING THAT'S GOING TO BE BUILT IN THE TRANS. AND IF I COULD ANSWER. A COUPLE OF YOUR OTHER PIECES THE QUESTION SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT STRUCTURES DDITIONAL DENSITY UNLESS YOU'RE NEAR MAJOR TRANSIT IN WHICH CASE WE LATER ON MORE SO. WE TRY TO SCULPTED -- DEPENDING THE AREA SO THAT WOULD MEAN IN A RURAL AREA YOU COULD RECEIVE A CERTAIN LEVEL OF DENSITY BUT NOT THE MORE THE THE T. MORE SIGNIFICANT DENSITY THAT YOU WOULD IF YOU WERE IN AN URBAN AREA SO THAT'S A PARTIAL ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION -- YOU ALSO ASKED ABOUT -- YOUR PERSPECTIVE WHICH I SHARE THAT WE WHERE POSSIBLE WOULD NOT WANT -- TO OVER CONCENTRATE -- AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- AND I THINK IDEALLY THAT WOULD BE THE CASE BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT -- THAT'S EASIER SAID THAN DONE ONE AMENDMENT THAT WE HAVE TAKEN AT THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTION WHICH WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE COMMITTEE TO DO. IS TO ALLOW. FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF MODERATE INCOME WORKFORCE HOUSING PROJECTS -- TO RECEIVE THE DENSITY BONUSES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SO WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT A 100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN SOME INSTANCES TO PAYER THE DENSITY BONUS THAT IS ENHANCED THROUGH THIS BILL WITH ARE MIXED INCOME LOAN PROGRAM AT CAL HFA. WHICH WOULD ALLOW FOR MODERATE INCOME HOUSING TO BENEFIT FROM THE DENSITIES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SO THAT WAS AN AMENDMENT THAT -- THE CHAIRED ASKED FOR IN A VERY GOOD SUGGESTION. THAT'S GREAT SO SO THE REASON I ASKED ABOUT RURAL COMMUNITIES IS THAT THE HIGHEST ENTITIES ITS ALLOWED IN -- IN. SALINAS I CAN SPEAK TO THE SALINAS IN THE SALINAS VALLEY AND I WANT TO SAY PROBABLY SAN BENITO COUNTY IT'S REACHED THREE STORIES AND IF YOU DRIVE AROUND YOU WON'T SEE ANYTHING THAT'S A THREE STORY. APARTMENT BUILDING THAT I CAN THINK OF AND SO. SO OF IT GOING TO FIVE BECOMES SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER DENSITY THAN THAN WHAT WOULD NORMALLY BE SO THAT'S THE REASON FOR THAT. IS THERE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN URBAN AND RURAL AND DO YOU HAVE A ARE YOU GONNA BE ROLLING -- RURAL COMMUNITY SAID THAT MOVING ISSUE HAS TO DO WITH -- INCLUSION OR HOW HOUSING ORDINANCES BECAUSE SOME OF THEM -- ALLOW THE DENSITY BONUS. AT THE ROOT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IF YOU ARE BUILDING AFFORDABLE UNITS AS PART OF YOUR PROJECT AND SO HOW DOES THIS WORK THIS ONE TRUMP THE OTHER OR DO ARE THEY CUMULATIVE I GUESS IS THE QUESTION BECAUSE WE'VE HAD THIS ROBLEM. BEFORE WITH OUR DEN WITH OUR INCLUSIONARY HOUSING ORDINANCES BEING OVERRIDDEN BY STATE LAW THAT LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE GIVING AN EXTRA DENSITY BONUS ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE. WHEN I WAS MY CHIEF CONSULTANT TO YOU HAVE AN INCLUSIONARY ORDNANCE THEN THE INCLUSIONARY IS COUNTED WITHIN THE DENSITY BONUS SO IT'S NOT CUMULATIVE OKAY [inaudible] GREAT. OKAY WELL THE THAT THAT THE REAL ISSUE IS HAS ME A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED BUT FRANKLY IF YOU GIVE US MONEY TO BUILD -- TRANSPORTATION CENTERS AND I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE INCREASE IN THE DEBT SEX WE JUST NEVER GET THE MONEY -- AND THAT'S A SUBJECT OF AN EPIC ANOTHER COMES UP AND WORK WITH YOU ON THAT. TOO OKAY -- SEE NO OTHER COMMENTS I ALSO JUST WANT TO KNOW -- IN TERMS OF THE CONCENTRATION ISSUE -- CENTER COMING AIR RAIDS. EVEN -- THANK YOU FOR ACCEPTING AMENDMENT FOR THE KEY -- TO ONE TWENTY MODERATE INCOME -- CATEGORY BUT EVEN UP 280% OF THE AMOUNT AM I EVEN THOUGH WE THAT'S GENERALLY CATEGORIZED SAYS SOME LEVEL OF LOW INCOME WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT SOMEONE WHO'S A 607080% OF AM I DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE IN THE STATE THAT COULD BE SOMEONE MAKING. FORTY OR FIFTY OR SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OF THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY MUCH A PART OF OF WHAT WE WOULD CONSIDER CLASSIC -- QUOTE UNQUOTE WORKING CLASS -- SO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT -- THE THE LOWEST INCOME PEOPLE TO IT'S A REAL MIX REGARDLESS. GREAT -- SO WE DO HAVE A MOTION BY CENTER ROTH AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE JUST AGAIN APPRECIATE THE CONSIDERATION AND HOUSE FOR A VOTE -- WE WILL CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS AN ABLE SEVENTEEN SIXTY THREE BASED ON THE NUMBER TO MOTIONS TO PASS AS AMENDED IN REFER THE COMMITTEE AND GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE SENATOR WIENER HI WIENER I MORAL BATES. CARO. CARO I DRAWS -- MCGUIRE MORE LOCK. ARMONK I ROUGH. ROTH AYE SKINNER. I'M BURKE. CASKEY. FORTY SIX VOTERS FOUR ZERO WILL PUT THE ITEM ON CALL THANK YOU SIR ABSENT MEMBERS AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY AND THEN LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST -- WE HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- GARCIA HERE FOR ITEM FIFTEEN AB. FIFTEEN SIXTY ONE GOOD AFTERNOON I'M GOING TO TRY TO BE BRIEF. GOT SOME IS BACK TO ANOTHER COMMITTEE LIKE THE REST OF A STRANGE DEVELOPED ALL -- GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN AND SENATORS AB FIFTEEN SIXTY ONE IT WOULD REQUIRE A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HOUSING ELEMENT. TO INCLUDE AN ANALYSIS OF GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRUCTION -- CONSTRAINTS. PROVIDE HOUSING FOR INDIVIDUALS IN THAT A FIVE UNDER THE UNDER THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT WERE PROTECTED -- CLASSES. OFTENTIMES AS WE DO YOU POLICIES WE HAVE. UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES SOMETIMES THEY MIGHT BE INTENDED AND MAYBE NOT THE RIGHT INTENTION. OUT THRE IS ALWAYS WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE ARE. TALKING ABOUT HOUSE SCENE THAT WE ARE THINKING ABOUT UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES ON OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES OVER TIME YOU ARE MODIFIED RELATIONS RULES POLICIES ACTIONS ORDINANCES. AND OTHER PLANNING AND ZONING REQUIREMENTS BY CITIES AND COUNTIES HAVE LED TO INCREASE HOUSING COSTS. THIS INCREASED COST HAVE HAD A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE BEING MINDFUL OF THESE COMMUNITIES ALONG THE WAY. MICHAEL DINING WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION IS HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THIS GERMAN MEMBERS THANK YOU MICHAEL DOWNING HERE WITH C. B. I A REPRESENTING THE OVER -- THREE THOUSAND HOME BUILDERS AND DEVELOPERS TO BUILD MOST OF THE SINGLE FAMILY HOUSING IN THE STATE -- IN SUPPORT AND SPONSORING THE BILL. I THINK THE AUTHOR HAS STATED THE PURPOSE HERE THAT SOMETIMES HE'S LOCAL ORDINANCES DO HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE EFFECT ON COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND MINORITIES PARTICULARLY AS WE LOOK BACK IN THE HISTORY OF HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE THOUGHT THIS AN APPROPRIATE MEASURE THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AND NURTURE SUPPORT THANK YOU -- GERMAN MY NAME IS ROBERT ABA DHAKA I'M WITH CALIFORNIA [inaudible] THE BUILDERS. BOB MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY BUILDERS WAS FORMED. TO CLOSE THE WEALTH GAP FROM THE U. S. THROUGH HOMEOWNERSHIP WERE MOST CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. UP TWELVE CAP AMONG -- PERSONS OF COLOR. WE HAVE A ADVOCACY GROUP CALLED THE TWO HUNDRED AND IF SO STATEWIDE COALITION OF ETHNIC MINORITY LEADER CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS CIVIC LEADERS IN PEACE IN COLLEGE STUDENTS. AND WE'RE ADVOCATING FOR INCREASED HOUSING PRODUCTION. THAT ALL INCOME LEVELS -- AS A SPONSOR OF OF THIS BILL ALONG WITH -- CALIFORNIA -- CBO CBI. AND ALSO COR AND THE YEN BEES -- I'M HERE THIS AFTERNOON TO SUPPORT AB FIFTY SIX WANTS BONTA AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA. NEWMAN MODIFIED HOUSING REGULATIONS WITH OTHER LEGISLATIVE AND IMPLEMENTED BY CITIES AND COUNTIES REGARDLESS OF INTENT. OF THE NEW VERSIONS OF REDLINING TO CONTRIBUTE TO KEEPING COMMUNITIES OF COLOR FROM ACCOMPLISHING THE AMERICAN DREAM. THAT IS HOMEOWNERSHIP. THE ENTIRE FAMILY IS AFFECTED BUT CHILDREN SUFFER THE MOST BY NOT HAVING ACCESS TO QUALITY EDUCATION HEALTH CARE. HEALTH FOOD OPTIONS PARTS AMONG THE BENEFITS RELATED TO HOMEOWNERSHIP -- THE TWO HUNDRED SUPPORT AB FIFTEEN SIXTY ONE BECAUSE IT IS CONSISTENT WITH EXISTING LAW AND PARTICULAR AB FIFTEEN SIXTY ONE AFFIRMATIVELY FURTHERS FOR HOUSING. THAT IS PROTECTED BY THE FOR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT. THE FOR ABOUT REASON WE ASK THAT YOU. UP APPROVED A. B. FIFTEEN SIXTY ONE AND ALSO APPROVAL OF THAT LEGISLATION TO INCREASE HOUSING PRODUCTION FOR ALL FAMILIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AARON EVANS ON BEHALF OF HABITAT FOR HUMANITY AND SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON LUIS BRONTE WITH CALIFORNIAN BE IN STRONG SUPPORT. HOLLY FOR MANY ON BEHALF OF SAND HILL PROPERTIES IN SUPPORT. STILL VEHICLE TO ARE YOU ARE IN FOR THE TWO HUNDRED AND STRONG SUPPORT. ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. THREE NUMBER IMPACT THE COMMITTEES SENATOR ROTH MOVES A BILL. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS COLLEAGUES. BUT YES ANNA CABALLERO. SO I'M I A REALLY APPRECIATE THAT -- THE PURPOSE AND I GUESS I'M I'M AT THE RIGHT THINK WE UNIVERSALLY APPEAR EVERYBODY AGREES THAT INCREASE PRODUCTION IS REALLY IMPORTANT. BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING. FOR AND I'M AND I'M A LITTLE PARANOID ABOUT PUTTING ANYTHING MORE. IN GENERAL PLANS AND IN HOUSING ELEMENTS. THAT IS JUST MAKE WORK FOR CITIES. SOME TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU'D BE LOOKING. FOR IN IN IN. IN THIS. AT THE END IN THIS BILL IT'S LIKE WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR AND THEN HOW DOES IT GET RESOLVED BECAUSE AB IT IT SEEMS TO ME. THIS IS MY VIEW OF THE WORLD IS THAT. WEALTHY COMMUNITIES EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO NOT BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING. BECAUSE THEY JUST DON'T WANT THOSE PEOPLE LIVING IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS. AND AND AND AND EVEN IN COMMUNITIES WHERE YOU HAVE -- ECONOMICALLY DIVERSE GROUPS -- EVERYBODY HAS THE SAME KIND OF MANTRA WE DON'T WANT THOSEPEOPLE LIVING I OUR NEIGHBORHOOD ALTHOUGH THEY ARE ALREADY LIVING THERE THERE RIGHT NEXT DOOR THEIR FOR THEIR PEOPLE YOU KNOW ALL ANY THAT YOU SEE. THERE THE PEOPLE THAT SERVE YOU RIGHT SO SO HE TO DO IT CITY BY CITY OR IT DOESN'T GET YOU WHERE YOU WANT. TO WANT TO GO HI I THINK. WHAT WHAT WHAT GET TO WEAR THAT THE ANALYSIS OF OUR IS THEIR DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES HOUSING PRACTICES IS WHEN YOU LOOK ON A REGIONAL BASIS? WHERE ARE THERE VERY FEW PEOPLE OF COLOR LIVING? AND WHERE THEY'RE VERY FEW PEOPLE THAT ARE ON CAN MAINTAINING THE ECONOMY THAT ARE THAT ARE. THAT ARE UNDER THE THE MEDIAN INCOME SO TO SPEAK OR DO THEY LIVE AT NIGHT AND I'M WONDERING HOW YOU GET THAT PUTTING THIS IN INTO -- INTO A A DOCUMENT THAT IS -- PART OF THAT PART OF WITH A CITY PRODUCES AND THAT THEY LOOK AT I'M I'M I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. MAY I THAT I JUST HE AND I AND AND I REALLY RESPECT THE AUTHOR AND THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE HERE IN SUPPORT I THINK IT'S GREAT I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW IT REALLY WORKS -- SO I WILL SAY THAT YOU HAVE CITIES THAT -- NY SAID AT THE BEGINNING UNINTENDED THE FOR SOME FOLKS IT IS AN INTENDED AND VERY INTENDED POLICY. THAT TRYING TO KEEP PEOPLE OUT SO WE'RE ASKING THAT. FOR THOSE THAT ARE UNINTENDED MAYBE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ASKING THEMSELVES THE QUESTION AND ASKING THEM THOUSANDS OF THE QUESTION IS THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS. THEM HAVING MORE EQUITABLE POLICIES IN DECISION MAKING I TING FOR THOSE WERE AT IT IS INTENDED MAYBE PUT IT OUT THERE. IN WRITING MIGHT GIVE US MY ALLOW FOLKS WHO LIKE TO WORK. TO HELP THEM BE MORE EQUITABLE AND HELP THEM WITH THE POSITION TO THAT SPOT I THINK WE COULD LOOK AT IT RECENTLY -- BUT I THINK AT THE A DAY WE HAVE TO START LOOKING AT WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE LOCAL LEVELS OF THE CITY'S GET TO HAVE THEIR OWN ORDINANCE. IT'S NOT GOING TO SOLVE EVERYTHING -- AND IT'S JUST A PIECE OF THE PUZZLE AND HIS CLIENTS TRYING TO CALL ATTENTION. I LOOK AT COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE -- AND THEN I LOOK AT NEIGHBORING COMMITTEES LIKE MINE THAT ARE BEING NEXT NEXT MY THAT ARE BEING IDENTIFIED THAT WERE JUST LIKE MINE AND WHO'S BEING PUSHED OUT AS WE'RE BUILDING UP. AS WERE REMODELING AS A SERENE GENTRIFIED AND PEOPLE BEING PUSHED OUT OUR PEOPLE I LOOK LIKE MY COMMUNITY AND IT'S BEING REPLACED BY. MIDDLE CLASS FOLKS THAT LOOK VERY DIFFERENTLY AND AND THERE'S NOT THAT BALANCE AND I DO THINK. THAT WELL I WANT THAT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT -- AND IN SOME GOOD THINGS HAVE COME FROM FROM THAT JUSTIFICATION WE NEED TO BE ASKING THEMSELVES QUESTIONS IS THAT IT'S JUST PRETENDING THAT. IT DOESN'T MATTER IT DOESN'T EXIST BECAUSE TOO OFTEN WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THE SMOKE SOMEWHERE. INTENTIONAL AND UNINTENTIONAL AT THAT PRACTICE [inaudible] SENATOR BATES. I'M HAVE HAVING SERVED ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND HAND THE STARTING IN A REGIONAL GENERAL PLAN -- INCORPORATED OUR COMMUNITY THIS JUST SEEMS SO COMPLICATED. OUR APPROACH RATHER THAN JUST REQUIRING IN A GENERAL PLAN THAT YOU HAVE AN AX NUMBER OF UNITS THAT ARE. AFFORDABLE BECAUSE THE A FIFTY AFFORDABILITY THAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE FOR PEOPLE LOW INCOME PEOPLE OF COLOR. IT'S ALL ABOUT AFFORDABILITY. SO IF YOU HAVE THAT AS YOUR MEASURE IT WOULD SEEM TO ME YOU MEET THAT STANDARD BUT HAVING SOME OF THE SUBSETS. I'M NOT SURE HOW YOU HOW YOU ACHIEVE THAT. ANGIE AND I ARE ON THE COUNTY OF ORANGE REQUIRED THAT WAS IN THE EIGHTIES THEY REQUIRE 25% AFFORDABLE THEY PUT A TWENTY FIVE YEAR. REQUIREMENT THAT THOSE REMAIN AFFORDABLE AND I WILL TELL YOU WHEN THAT CAME OFF -- THE THE THE RUSH TO BUY SOME OF THOSE HOMES BECAUSE IT WAS REQUIRED IN THE COASTAL AREA. ALONG THE BEACHES AS A MATTER OF FACT THOSE THINGS SOLD LIKE HOTCAKES AT MARKET RATES BY THAT TIME IT WAS FOUR OR FIVE TIMES. A WITH THE ORIGINAL OWNERS PAGE SO THAT THERE WAS A YOU KNOW AN AMAZING BONUS THAT WAS RECEIVED SO. THAT'S GOING TO COME DOWN TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL WHERE YOU PUT THE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR A LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY OF AFFORDABILITY. BUT IT YOU KNOW HOW LONG THEY HAVE TO STATE AFFORDABLE VERSUS THE MARKET RATE SO IT SEEMS TO ME IF YOU WOULD REQUIRE AND A GENERAL PLAN SOMETHING AS BROAD AS YOU HAVE TO MAINTAIN AND PURPOSE TO IT. IN AFFORDABLE LEVEL -- FOR THE VARIOUS INCOME LEVELS YOU KIND OF SOLVE YOUR PROBLEM. THE PUTTING SOME OF THESE OTHER SUBSETS IN THERE I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT. FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO CHIEF BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S GOING TO HAVE A DIFFERENT PERCEPTION OF THAT. IN FROM COMMUNITY TO COMMUNITY AND I SAW OME STATISTICS RECENTLY WHERE. STATES LIKE FOR EXAMPLE TEXAS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LOW INCOME OR PEOPLE OF COLOR. THEY HAVE 51% HOMEOWNERSHIP VERSUS WHAT WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA'S NEARLY 30% I THINK IT'S SOMEWHERE AROUND 24%. SO THERE ARE REGULATIONS THAT ARE IN PLACE HERE IN TERMS OF HOW YOU BUILD HOMES THAT ARE. KEEPING PEOPLE OUT IN ITS ABOUT THE AFFORDABILITY REQUIREMENTS THAT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO PUT AN END GENERAL PLAN. SO A I'M I'M GONNA STAY OFF TODAY BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE WORKING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. BUT I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE SIMPLE IF YOU'RE GOING TO ASK -- IT BE COOKIE CUTTER FOR EVERY GENERAL PLAN AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT'S DEVELOPED BY A LOCAL GOVERNMENT BE THAT A COUNTY OR CITY. GIVE THEM SOMETHING THAT'S VERY WORKABLE AND THEN AT THE MANDATING IT MAKES IT VERY GOOD. BUT CHAU TO HELP BE SUBSETS I THINK THAT -- IT DID VERY DIFFICULT DIRECTION TO ASK THEM TO GO IN AND I WILL SAY COSTS THEM A LOT OF MONEY AND IT CAN ELAY. DELAY DELAY IN GETTING WHERE YOU WANT TO GO. CENTER MORE LUCK. SORRY -- SOMEONE WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND OR I MEAN I I WOULD SAY THAT. WE ARE JUST ASKING THAT THEY ASKED THE QUESTION WE ARE NOT ASKING THAT THEY CARVE OUT OR DO ANY PERCENTAGES OF ANY SORT. IN THEIR BILL THE FIRST STEP IS THAT THE AFTER QUESTION AND MAYBE IN ASKING THE QUESTION THEY MIGHT DECIDE THAT. THEY WANT TO ADDRESS THAT WHEN THE WHEN THE OFFICE OF THE QUESTION DO WE SEE THE SEVERITY HERE MAYBE WE SHOULD ADDRESS IT. BECAUSE THAT THERE BE AN INTENTIONAL BUT THE QUESTIONS BEING ASKED -- THE IDEA OF HAVING -- QUOTAS AND HAVING THEM BE FOR MEN IT IS WORTH THE IDEA IF I THINK A DIFFERENT BLL FOR SOMEONE ELSE TO WORK ON INCLUDING YOURSELF AND SOMETHING FOR YOU TO COME IN SALINAS CITIES ABOUT. I CENTER MORE LOCK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THE SILLY WOMAN GARCIA JUST. TRYING TO I'M I'M STRUGGLING LIKE CENTER CARRIER OF TRYING. TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON IT SEEMS TO ME YOU'RE READING HISTORY. YOU'RE LOOKING BACK AND SAYING THIS IS THE EVOLUTION OF OUR CITY. AND WE WRITE IT DOWN. AND THEN HOW DOES THAT CHANGE EVERY FIVE DAY YEARS. WHAT I DON'T KNOW THAT WHERE I BEING IN ASKING THE QUESTION SO HOW WE HAVE DONE AND IN HISTORY HAVE WE DONE IT RIGHT AND WE HAVE AND THEN A RIGHT CAN WE DO IT BETTER? I THINK WE GET A WE ARE ASKING WE WILL THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO LIKE TO PRETEND THAT WE ARE COLOR COLOR BLIND. THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY IMPLICIT BIAS OUT THERE -- AND AND THAT WE LIVE IN A PRETTY EQUITABLE SOCIETY ALREADY AND I THINK PART OF WHAT I'M ASKING WITH THIS BILL IS IS THAT THE REALITY WE REALLY LIVE IN. AND ASKING FOR THOUSAND SOUTH SOME UNCOMFORTABLE QUESTIONS AT TIMES WE DON'T WANT LIKE BECAUSE OF THESE QUESTIONS. BUT I'VE SEEN OUR SOUTH SOUTH OF UNCOMFORTABLE QUESTIONS ALONG THE WAY. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE UNCOMFORTABLE [inaudible] SO I'M. THERE IS A HISTORICAL. ACTIVITY THAT GOES ON OLDER HOUSING TRACKS TEND TO BE. AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT HISTORICALLY THAT'S WHERE PEOPLE TEND TO MOVE TO AND AND SOME. TRYING TO SEE WHAT WOULD THERE BE LIKE A A STANDARD FOR HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE ON HOW CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOODS INVOLVED AND THEN. IF YOU DEVIATE FROM THAT THAT'S WHERE YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE CHANGE OF ONE OF MY MISSING MISTER GUIDING. ALL I I THINK IN ANSWER TO CENTER BASE TO YOUR QUESTION I THINK WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE HAS BEEN -- DISCRIMINATORY HISTORY IN THE STATE WITH HOUSING AND IN FACT MOST PLANS ALREADY INCLUDE LOW VERY LOW ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING. BUT IT HASN'T BEEN MET BECAUSE WE'RE AT THE CRISIS WERE AT NOW I THINK WHAT THIS BILL **** FOR IT AS THE AUTHOR SAID TO TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THOSE PATTERNS HAVE BEEN AND TO ASK IF THIS NEW HOUSING IS GOING. TO CONTINUE THAT PATTERN. I I THINK IT'S A IT'S A VERY SIMPLE QUESTION THAT THAT THAT CITY PLANNERS HAVE TO ASK THEMSELVES. HELLO SENATOR -- SKINNER IS MENTIONED A BOOK A COUPLE TIMES IN COMMITTEE ISOLATE. WHO WOULD THAT BE COLOR OF LAW SO SO THAT WOULD BE A HISTORICAL OPPORTUNITY THAT YOU COULD? USE IS A MIRROR THEN. THREE SEVEN YEARS THIS APPROACH MISSES WHAT YOUR CITY IS DONE AND HERE'S WHERE THE SELF EVALUATION OR REFLECTION. SHOULD COLLECTIVELY COME FROM I DON'T THINK I I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE CASE CENTER I THINK WHAT THE BOOK DOES THIS POINT OUT THE GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR ROLE IN THE HOUSING PATTERNS WE HAVE IN THE STATE. AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND SO AS A AS AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THAT HISTORY AND GOING FORWARD WE'RE ASKING CITIES AND COUNTIES TO LOOK AT THEIR THEIR GENERAL PLANS AND ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING AGAIN. BEST OF THOUGHT. BUT IF THEY LOOK AT IT AND THEY DON'T SEE SOMETHING. THAT MAYBE SOMEONE ELSE WOULD WHO'S THE REFEREE TO HELP THEM OUT AS ARE GONNA BE LIKE A COACH THAT'LL. HELP OUT OF THESE GENERAL PLANS TO SAY WELL LOOK AT THIS POINTS BY YOU. TOTALLY MISSED IT. I MEAN I WOULD SAY THAT CITIES OFTEN ENGAGE IN PROCESSES THAT ARE BUT WITH THE PUBLIC THAT ARE WITH CONSULTANTS. I TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE BEST DO THIS AN ANSWER THIS QUESTION AND GET THESE ANSWERS -- AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT. I'M CONFIDENT CITIES WILL TRY TO FIGURE OUT AND AND IF THEY DON'T I'M CONFIDENT THAT HOPEFULLY IN SOME OF THESE COMMUNITY STILL BE. FOLKS WHO ARE ALERT AND AWARE AND ARE GONNA SAY HEY THIS IS NOT WITHIN THE SPREAD OF WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING HEAVY ASK YOURSELF. THESE QUESTIONS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT REPEATING PATTERNS WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE LEARNING WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE TAKING THE LESSONS IN THE BOOKS. THAT ARE OUT THERE IN TRYING TO SAY HOW CAN WE DO IT BETTER WE ALSO IN LOSS EVERY HUMAN BEINGS AND SO IT'S ARE GOING TO BE PERFECT AND WE COULD HAVE THAT CONTINUOUS. SELF REFLECTION. THANK YOU MISTER. YES WOULD ALSO YOUR PREFERRED HELL JUST VERY BRIEFLY. I THINK I THINK TO OR TALKING ABOUT IS IT. NEW REGULATIONS -- WELL IN VERY BE THE INCREASE THE COST OF HOUSING. AND SO. THE INTENT MAY NOT BE TO DISCRIMINATE. BUT THE MORE YOU PILE ON THE REGULATIONS. BY DEFINITION. THE COP THE COST GOES UP SO THEIR FOR SOMEBODY WHO'S JUST KIND OF MARGINAL. THANK COULD LIVE IN A SUBURB. IT'S NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO LIVE THERE AND THAT'S DISCRIMINATORY. SO THE EXAMPLE [inaudible] RIGHT NOW. THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD. HAS HE BEEN ON A LOT OF REGULATIONS. WHICH IS GOING TO MAKE IT VERY VERY EXPENSIVE TO BUILD. IN THE SUBURBS. AND FOR THE REASON BECAUSE THE THEY HAVE A NEW POLICIES CALLED OF THE NET. ZERO POLICY SO THAT EVERYTHING IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE SOLD ORDERS ALWAYS OTHER. OF REQUIREMENTS THAT THAT -- THAT THE DETECTION TUNED CALCULATIONS IN TERMS OF HOW MANY MILES OUT HOUSEHOLDS GOING TO DRIVE TO WORK AND SO FORTH SO THEREFORE THE DEVELOPERS GOING TO HAVE TO PAY. IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO PAY. FOR ALL THIS TRANSPORTATION US AND THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL COST -- HAS TO GO IN THERE SO WHAT WAS GOOD WHAT YOU THOUGHT WHAT'S GOING TO BE A POSSIBLE IS NOT GONNA BE POSSIBLE BOB. THANK YOU MR ROBERT GOT BECAUSE THAT YOU BRING UP. THE REAL REASON WHAT WHAT WHERE WERE TRÃªN TRYING TO DIG INTO SO SO THAT YOUR PLANTS AS THANKS TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THE FOLLOWING REGULATIONS. AND IT CREATED THE PROBLEM WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT MY RUN. I THANK YOU -- I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR THIS -- LEGISLATION AYE -- SUPPORTED I'D LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR IF YOU WOULD. BE WILLING TO ACCEPT THAT -- AND I I ACTUALLY DO THINK EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A VERY IT'S A VERY SIMPLE LOOKING BOTH VERY STRAIGHT FORWARD IT'S IT'S NOT -- IS THAT IT'S NOT. FIVE LOOKS. IT IS VERY STRONG FOR A LOT OF WAYS I THINK IT WILL BE VERY USEFUL. FIRST OF ALL IT'S AS FORCING CITIES WHEN THEY GO THROUGH THEIR GENERAL PLAN HOUSING ON THEM PROCESS. TO ACTUALLY. GRAPPLE WITH THIS AND AND TO THINK ABOUT -- AND TO TAKE. AND AND TO BE. ENGAGE IN SELF REFLECTION AND TO BE INTENTIONAL ABOUT IT'S THAT IN OF ITSELF AS A WIN. I ALSO WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT. THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT -- GETTING CITIES TO ALLOW MORE BILL MORE -- AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE DON'T WE ALREADY. REQUIRE THAT AND SOMETIMES IT WORKS SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T. BUT WE KNOW THAT CITIES WILL SOMETIMES PUT ALL THEIR FORMAL HOUSING IN JUST ONE AREA -- WHICH FROM ACTUALLY IT'S NOT PERPETUATE SOME THESE PROBLEMS. AND SO THEY'RE ALL SORTS OF ISSUES THAT COULD BE -- SUGGESTS -- FROM ANTI WHAT KIND OF AND ITS PLACE FROM PROTECTIONS ALLEN PLAYS OWNING IT CETERA CETERA SO -- IN THIS IS A GOOD STEP AND ON INTO IS AN AYE RECOMMENDATION -- WITH THAT WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR ROTH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I'M GONNA BE BRIEF -- WE AT THE STATE PASSED POLICIES THAT HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES -- AND I'M GONNA DISAGREE A LITTLE BIT WITH WHAT I MY WITNESSES AND STUFF THAT. ARE A DISTRICT THAT'S TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES LIKE MINUS IMPORTED AS WELL -- I LIVE IN ONE OF THE MOST TOXIC COMMUNITY THING YOU GUYS HAVE TO HEAR ABOUT. THE TOXICITY TO THE VILLAGE THAT KERRY AND SO I'M NOT SAYING THAT IT DOESN'T ADD ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT ALONG THE WAY. BY -- I I DO WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THAT. BUT WE SHOULD BE ASKING OURSELVES INTENTIONAL QUESTIONS AMERICAN TO BE INCLUDING THAT THEIR DISTRICT ABOUT HOW WE ARE HELPING OR HURTING. COMMUNITIES COMMUNITIES OF COLOR COMMUNITIES ARE THIS ADVANTAGE. ALONG THE WAY AND ALL I'M ASKING HERE IS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WERE INTENTIONAL AND I WILL SAY THIS I WILL USE ONE OF MY SERVICE AS AN EXAMPLE. 70% OF THE NO. AND MY A MY COUNCIL DOES NOT REFLECT MY CITY LOOKS LIKE THEIR POLICIES ARE OFTEN PRETTY DISCRIMINATORY TO THE POPULATION THAT'S INCLUDING ON HOUSING AND HOW WE THINK ABOUT AFFORDABILITY OR TWO IS BUILDING UP. ALONG THE WAY AND WHEN I ASK HIM ABOUT THOSE QUESTIONS ARE PUSHED AND THEY TELL ME THOSE POOR PEOPLE OR THOSE PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HER MEXICAN. REALLY DON'T LIVE HERE AND THE TO STRIVE IN TO GO TO OUR SCHOOLS -- AND AND THEY THEY LIVE ON THE OTHER SIDE IN WHICH YOU COULD GET UP BETWEEN MY CITY IN YOUR CITY. HI AND I GET THAT ON A REGULAR BASIS IN A COMMUNITY LIKE MINE AND SO MAYBE THEY ARE FORCED TO ASK THEMSELVES THE QUESTION A LOOK AT THE REALITY THEY CAN START THINKING OF BETTER MORE INCLUSIVE POLICIES ALONG THE WAY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NAVAL.
