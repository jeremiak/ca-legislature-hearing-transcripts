SPIRITS AND WE ALL KNOW. THAT THERE ARE COUNTLESS HOURS THAT ARE POURED INTO THIS PROCESS MANY HOURS YET TO COME ON TO GET A DOCUMENT TO US ON THAT WE CAN VOTE ON ON BEHALF OF. ALL THE CONSTITUENTS WHO REPRESENT. THE BEAUTY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE OR THE DRAMA THE BUDGET DEVELOPMENT PROCESS IS IT AND HOW IT CULMINATES IN THE. CONFERENCE COMMITTEE IS THAT EACH HOUSE BRINGS TO THE TABLE AN IDEA OR CONCEPT. AND WE ADVOCATE IN ITS BEHALF THE WHOLE POINT OF THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE PROCESS. IS TO SKILLFULLY MERGE ALL THE VARIOUS IDEAS INTO ONE DOCUMENT. I IT'S NEVER OUR INTENT TO WILLFULLY PICK WINNERS VERSUS LOSERS BUT RATHER WE WORK TO DEVELOP A PLAN THAT BROADLY SUPPORTS THE PRESSING NEEDS OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. IN A FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE WAY ON AS THE CHAIRMAN SAID. THE ACTIONS WILL BE TAKING TODAY ARE THE RESULT OF NEGOTIATIONS. BETWEEN BOTH HOUSES LEADERSHIP OF BOTH HOUSES PLUS THE ADMINISTRATION. WE'RE ALREADY HEARING FROM ADVOCATES AND STAKEHOLDERS WHO HAVE SOME DEEP CONCERNS ABOUT ITEMS THAT WON'T BE FUNDED.

FRANKLY IT'S VASTLY LESS TIME THAN THE MAJORITY GOT THAT WE'RE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF GETTING WHAT TIME. WE DID GET. THAT'S WE BEGIN THIS SO CALLED CLOSURE. I MUST COMMENT. FLAWED PROCESS THAT WE HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH HERE FOR SEVERAL DAYS. AND IT IS. NOT THE NORM. IN VERY KEY RESPECTS. IN THOSE RESPECTS IN YOUR TO THE DISADVANTAGE. THE PEOPLE WE REPRESENT. THEIR REPRESENTATIVES LARGELY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. AND HAVEN'T TO THE LAST MANY DAIS. INCLUDING TO THIS DAY. THEY THEREFORE. WON'T KNOW EITHER. AND MAJOR MAJOR POLICY YET AGAIN. IS BEING AFFECTED. IN THE BUDGET. AND WE HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN ALL THE TRAILER BILLS WHERE MOST OF THE LITTLE GAMES. A CAR. I WOULDN'T TREAT. OUR LEADERS. AND OUR MEMBERS. THAT OUR MEMBERS DO HAVE A SAY. DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN. NEXT NEXT YEAR IT NOT BE DONE. THIS WAY. EVERYTHING SO FAR. EXCEPT ABOUT FOUR VOTES. HAS BEEN DONE BEHIND CLOSED DOORS. A CONFERENCE COMMITTEE PROCESS HISTORICALLY IS WHERE BY. TWO VERSIONS OF A BILL OR A BUDGET. NOW RECONCILED HERE. IN A ROOM LIKE THIS. MEMBERS TALK WITH EACH OTHER. NEGOTIATE. MAKE COMPROMISES THE WHOLE WORLD. AND WE VOTE. AND WE WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ALONG THE WAY. AND THERE WAS A DAY. WHEN GEORGE DEUKMEJIAN. TEN BEING THE BIG FIVE. I WAS A PART OF THAT FOR FIVE YEARS. THE BIG FIVE WHERE THE. REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC LEADERS IN THE GOVERNOR. WHOEVER THEY WERE. AND THEY MET ONLY ON THE MOST YOUR RESOLVABLE ISSUES. FEW YEARS AGO WE HAD THE BIG FIVE DOING ALL BUDGET. THE WHOLE BUDGET. THE ONE IS THE REST OF US IN HERE YOU GO. NOW. WE ONLY HAVE THE BIG THREE. FRANKLY OTHER THAN A BUNCH OF WORDS THROWN UP IN THE SKY HERE. AND BOATS IN THE SUB COMMITTEES. WHICH ALREADY HAVE BEEN PUNY BEEN DISREGARDED AND CHANGED THE SUBCOMMITTEE ACTIONS. WELL WE'VE HAD OUR SAY AND WE'VE HAD OUR VOTES. BUT NO REAL HAND. IN CRAFTING OF THESE MAJOR ISSUES. SO MISTER CHAIRMAN WITH THANKS TO YOU AND TO ALL OF OUR STAFF. I DO HAVE A LARGER COMPLETE. ABOUT THE PROCESS WE HAD JUST ENDURED. AND WE DON'T EVEN KNOW YET WHAT IS TO COME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR SIMILAR BELOW. MISTER CHAIR AND AND MY THE ONLY ONE. WHO? HAS NOTICED THAT WE WAITED JUST LONG ENOUGH TO BEGIN THIS HEARING FOR THE GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS. TO BECOME NBA CHAMPIONS. THE I MAYBE I MEAN I THINK YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE BECAUSE THE REST OF US WERE GETTING READY FOR EMIT MISTER CHAIR I MAY. I GOT AN ALERT ON MY PHONE. I MAYBE A LAKERS FAN. AND I WILL ALWAYS BE A LAKERS FAN BUT I THINK IT'S. IT'S IT'S A GREAT THING THAT A CALIFORNIA TEAM HAS TAKEN THE CHAMPIONSHIP PLAN. ON A NIGHT WHEN WE'RE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING AND MAKING PROGRESS ON CALIFORNIA'S BUDGET WHICH. ON I THINK IS ALSO A CREDIT TO THIS GREAT STATE OF OURS THAT TOUCHES ON SO MANY ISSUES THAT ARE OF IMPORTANCE TO. CALIFORNIANS WE HAVE MUCH TO CELEBRATE BE THANKFUL FOR. THANK YOU SUMMIT OBERNOLTE. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'D LIKE TO AMPLIFY SOMETHING THAT SENATOR MITCHELL SAID BUT WE MAY BE HERE LATE AT NIGHT AND BE HERE LATER STILL TONIGHT BUT. THEY ARE BUDGET COMMITTEE STAFF HAS BEEN WORKING LATE NIGHTS FOR WEEKS ON THIS BUDGET AND SO I THINK IT'S ONLY FAIR TO US A BIG THANK YOU. TO OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OF LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND ALL OF OUR RESPECTIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE STAFFS FOR ALL OF THEIR HARD WORK. ARE ALSO I'D LIKE TO AMPLIFY SOMETHING THAT. THAT SENATOR NIELSEN WAS TALKING ABOUT NOW AND THAT IS THAT THE. THIS REALLY COULD BE A MUCH MORE TRANSPARENT PROCESS AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT FRUSTRATES ME IS I LIKE MAKING INFORMED DECISIONS. ON THE THINGS THAT I VOTE ON. EVEN IF ARE NOT IN THE MAJORITY SOMETIMES I LIKE THOSE DECISIONS TO BE INFORMED AND WHEN WE GET. PLACEHOLDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IS RUINED OUR CLEAR WHAT WE'RE VOTING ON SO IT WOULD BE NICE IN THE FUTURE IF WE COULD SEGMENT OUT THOSE SECTIONS OF THE BUDGET. FOR CONSIDERATION LATER BECAUSE WE COULD RUN BUT BUDGET TRAILER BILLS LATER IN THE YEAR USUALLY WITHOUT. ARE AFFECTING THE PROCESS THAT WE DO ANNA IN A VENUE LIKE THIS EVENING. BUT I WANNA THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP MISTER CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU SENATOR MORLOCK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'D LIKE TO DIRECT MY THOUGHTS TO THE OVERALL BUDGET AND AND THE DIRECTION. WE ARE LOOKING AT WHAT I WOULD CALL A BUMPER CROP. HAVING GONE THROUGH SOME PRETTY ROUGH YEARS. AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL ARE RUNNING ONE OF THE LARGEST COUNTIES BY POPULATION IN THE COUNTRY. IT'S KIND OF NICE TO BE. IN THIS POSITION WHERE YOU HAVE A LITTLE EXTRA MONEY AS OPPOSED TO MAKING. LAYOFFS OF ABOUT A THOUSAND PEOPLE. SO EQUITIES ARE UP UNEMPLOYMENT IS DOWN. AND IT SEEMS THAT WHEN YOU GET A LITTLE BIT OF A BONUS WE SHOULD BE PAYING DOWN OUR CREDIT CARD BALANCES. OR WE SHOULD BE PUTTING FUNDS ASIDE. THAT'S A GOOD THING WE'RE DOING THAT IN THIS BUDGET. BUT BUT PAYING DOWN A LITTLE MORE ON OUR PENSION PLAN LIABILITIES OR A RETIREE MEDICAL. NOW. LIABILITIES REP TO NINETY ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IN. WE'LL BE STARING US IN THE FACE WITH THE JUNE THIRTIETH. TWENTY EIGHTEEN BALANCE SHEET WHEN IT COMES OUT NEXT SPRING. THAT'S MY CONCERN ABOUT THE WHOLE THE WHOLE PROCESS IS THE BIGGER PICTURE IN. AND SO. IF WE WERE TO PAY DOWN A PENSION PLAN LIABILITY THAT THAT THAT SEVEN PERCENT INTEREST BECAUSE IRAQ WILL BE EARNING. AS OPPOSED TO. YOU KNOW LESS THAN A HALF A PERCENT RIGHT NOW IS IT LANGUISHES IN THAT THE STATE TREASURY. SO I WANT TO IMPROVE THE BALANCE SHEET SO THAT WOULD BE SOME OF MY BIASES AS. I APOLOGIZE FOR BEING WILL. MAYBE CAN ULTRACONSERVATIVE OR MAYBE AS OBSERVING THE GLASS IS HALF. FULL. I'M BUT SOMETIMES I SIT I THINK WE'RE DANCING ON THE DECK OF THE DIKE TITANIC AND. SO I THINK WE NEED TO BE REAL CAREFUL WE SHOULD LISTEN TO THE GOVERNOR. WHEN HE SAYS WE NEED TO BE PREPARED FOR THE NEXT RECESSION BECAUSE HE AND I ARE OLD ENOUGH. TO KNOW WE GO THROUGH THEM. SO WITH THAT. MISTER CHAIR THIS BUDGET IS DOING A LOT OF GOOD THINGS AND IN A COULD DO MORE. SO WITH THAT I I JUST HAD ONE QUESTION FOR YOU SINCE. THIS IS MY SECOND GO ROUND IN. IT MADE HIM TO BE INTERESTING. A LAST MINUTE INTO THE NIGHT KINDA DEALS. THIS ONE WAS A LITTLE. MORE. BUT WALKING IN THE DARK FOR ME. NOTHING WAS CLEAR. I WILL ONE FOOT AHEAD AND SO I'M JUST ONE IF YOU CAN GIVE AN EVALUATION OF THE PROCESS. THIS YEAR. AND AND THEN MAYBE THEN. WHAT WE DO TO IMPROVE IT OR MAYBE IT'S THE WAY IT IS AND THAT? OR YOU KNOW BECAUSE THINGS HAVE EVOLVED SENATE AND CENTER NIELSEN ALREADY MENTIONED. BIG FIVE BIG THREE HE. YOU NO I I AND SO I WANTED KIND OF WONDER OUR WE RELEVANT. OR ARE WE NOT DO WE NEED TO JUST CLOSE DOWN OR DO WE NEED TO RE EVALUATE. THE WHOLE SYSTEM. I THINK THAT WILL FIRST THANK YOU. TELL MY COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR GREAT COMMENTS I DID WANT TO. JUMP OFF ON WHERE MISTER OBERNOLTE MENTIONED IN JUST AGAIN THANK THE STAFF. THAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LA O. R. ASSEMBLY. BUDGET STAFF THAT THE REPUBLICAN STAFF THE SENATE BUDGET STAFF ALL THE HOURS AND HOURS OF WORK. ON. IT JUST AND TAKING THAT THAT FEEDBACK. THAT THE BUDGET IS NOT. DONE IN CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. THE BUDGET IS A. FOR A FIVE MONTH PROCESS IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE START IN FEBRUARY WILL BE AND YOU KNOW YOU AN EARLIER WE START IN. JANUARY WITH IT WITH THE INITIAL BUDGET PROPOSAL. O. WE HAVE HOURS AND HOURS AND HOURS ON THE SUBCOMMITTEE HEARINGS DEBATE DISCUSSION. ON WE HAVE PUBLIC TESTIMONY PUBLIC COMMENT THE BULK OF THE BUDGET IS DONE IN THAT PROCESS THE VERY. LARGE BALK I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT NUMBER BUT I WOULD SAY PROBABLY NINETY TO NINETY FIVE PERCENT BUDGETS HUNDRED AND. FORTY BILLION DOLLARS YOU'RE PROBABLY SINGLE LARGE PART OF IT DONE STOOD OUT SUBCOMMITTEE PROCESS AND THAT DISCUSSION THAT DEBATE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. IRONS OUT THE FINAL FINAL FINAL DETAILS THE FINAL PUBLISHED FEW BILLION DOLLARS THAT WE ARE EARNING OUTSIDE OF PROP NINETY WHICH. IT'S OBVIOUSLY A LARGE CHUNK OF THE BUDGET A SEPARATE FROM THAT THAT THE FINAL. EVALUATION OF THAT HOME WE ARE IN DISCUSSION ABOUT REALLY JUST FINE TUNING THE ULTIMATE DETAILS OF OUR BUDGET. LARGE PART OF IT AGAIN GHOSTS WITHOUT SUBCOMMITTEE PROCESS THROUGH EXHAUSTIVE DISCRETION IF YOU STICK TO OUR. OR SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER ONE WHICH IS. DOCTOR ARAMBULA CHAIRS AYE IF YOU CAN TELL YOU ABOUT HOW MANY HOURS AND HOURS. HEARINGS ON EVERY SINGLE ITEM THEY HAVE NOT NOT HAVING HAVING SAID IT A WHAT IT CONFERENCE COMMITTEE ITSELF COULD BE IMPROVED AYE I THINK ABSOLUTELY THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT. I THINK THIS YEAR ON. EVERY ETHNIC EVERY BUDGET IS REALLY DEPENDENT ON HOW DISCUSSIONS GO. TO AND HOW THAT FEEDBACK IS DONE TO WEAR IT. THE DIFFERENT VERSIONS ARE AND HOW THAT. DISCUSSION OR GOES THROUGH WHEN THIS YEAR DID SEEM TO BE A LITTLE BIT HARDER THAN THE PREVIOUS TWO YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE BUDGET. ON THINK THERE VARIETY OF FACTORS I DON'T THINK ANY OF THEM ARE. TOM YOU KNOW ARE ANY OF THEM ARE SOME THINGS THAT WE WOULD CARRY OVER TO NEXT YEAR. BUT I THINK IT'S JUST DEPENDENT ON WHERE THE WHERE THE HOUSES ARE AND WHERE THE GOVERNOR'S. BUT AGAIN I THINK THE ARM BULK OF THE BUDGET THIS IS WHAT I FIVE HAD NO NUMBER TOM RESOURCES WITH RESTORED NOTED THAT. THE BULK OF THE BUDGET THE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT THE DISCUSSION IS DONE AND THAT SUB COMMITTEE. PROCESS. AND THAT IS DONE THROUGH HOURS AND HOURS AND HOURS A PAINSTAKING TESTIMONY AND FEEDBACK AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE. WILL TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY I KNOW ALL OUR STAFF TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY AND I JUST ENCOURAGE. EVERYBODY WHETHER IT'S US AS SENATORS ASSEMBLYMEMBERS OR OR THE PUBLIC OR. LA EL OR FINANCED THAT IS REALLY WHERE I FEEL LIKE THE BULK OF THE GIVE AND TAKE ON THE BUDGET PROCESS ART DID THIS IS REALLY DEFINE. THE FINE TUNING THIS IS SORT OF LIKE ICING ON THE CAKE AT THAT POINT THE KICKS ALREADY. BEEN BACK THROUGH THAT PROCESS SO THAT'S THAT'S HOW I WOULD. ANSWER YOUR QUESTION FOR MAYBE JUST TO. TERM ROUTE RESPOND. MY REVIEW OF THIS. LITTLE RESEARCH I GOT ON THE STATE CONSTITUTION IS YOU'RE RIGHT YOU GO THROUGH THE. SUBCOMMITTEE PROCESS AND I'VE. WRITTEN A LITTLE TOO GOOD BINDER FULL OF STUFF. THIS YEAR IN SUB ONE IN. AND BRIGHT ENJOY THE PROCESS. AND AND FLY HOME LATE ON THURSDAYS BECAUSE OF IT. BUT. THAT THE GOVERNOR SUPPOSED TO GIVE THE. BUDGET ON JANUARY TEN WE GO THROUGH SUB WHAT WE GO THROUGH OUR SUBCOMMITTEES. AND. AND THEN WE SHOULD GO THROUGH BUDGET CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. BUT SUCH AND THEN IT GOES TO THE GOVERNOR. THAT'S HOW I I INTERPRETED THE CONSTITUTION BUT NOW IT'S. JANUARY CHEN SUBCOMMITTEES THE GOVERNOR INSERTS. WE GET A BUDGET AND THEN IT COMES TO THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE SO WE GET A PRESS RELEASE THIS MORNING ITS HAS EVERYTHING'S DONE AND. OVER IN. AND SO. I THINK MAYBE A REVIEW OF WHAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS ARE.

THE AGENDA NOTES THAT THE CONFERENCE COMPROMISE DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY FUNDING FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION HOWEVER I WOULD KNOW THAT IN THE LATER ITEM ON ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO RECRUIT SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS IS APPROVED. THANK YOU MISTER BLOW. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I'D LIKE TO RAISE AN ISSUE THAT SAID. ACTUALLY CAUSING ME SOME CONCERN BECAUSE THEY'VE RECEIVED A LETTER. ALL ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS THAT DATA EXPRESSES. A GOOD DEAL OF CONCERN OVER THE. NON INCLUSION OF THE. ASSEMBLY BUDGET PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE. ONGOING FUNDING FOR SUPPLEMENTAL. GRANTS FOR THE LOWEST PERFORMING STUDENTS SUBGROUP. THAT IS A CONCERN. A IN THE CAUCUSES IS SO DEEP THAT. OF THE LETTER EXPRESSES THE THE THOUGHT THAT SOME OF A OF MY COLLEAGUES MIGHT ACTUALLY NOT GO UP ON THE BUDGET OVER THIS ISSUE AND AS YOU KNOW. MISTER CHAIRMAN OF MS COSTA THAT'S A. PRETTY SERIOUS SIR OF A THING TO SAY SO I'M I'M WONDERING IF YOU COULD. A TALK ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION'S THINKING ON THIS ISSUE AND. WHY THE ADMINISTRATION LAND WHERE TED? THANK YOU I WOULD NOTE THIS WAS A WOULD INITIALLY ORIGINALLY A LEGISLATIVE AUGMENTATION AND THAT THE FINAL PRODUCT REPRESENTS AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE THREE PARTIES BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEADERSHIP OF THE RESPECTIVE HOUSES. CAN THE ADMINISTRATION PROVIDE IT AT THIS. SO THIS WAS A PROPOSAL FROM THE ASSEMBLY AND AS I UNDERSTAND IT THE ADMINISTRATION. DIDN'T LIKE THE PROPOSAL SO IS A MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY I'M JUST ASKING WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S THINKING IS AND. NOT BEING ABLE TO SUPPORT IT. I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S AN ACCURATE CHARACTERIZATION OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S VIEW OF THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL THE SENATE HAD A SIMILAR PROPOSAL. ON TO DEAL WITH. LOW PERFORMING STUDENTS THERE WERE SLIGHT DIFFERENCES AND SO. THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME REPRESENTS A COMPROMISE. BETWEEN THOSE TWO PROPOSALS BY BY THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY. I. WHETHER OR NOT I'VE CHARACTERIZED IT ACCURATELY. YOU CAN CHARACTERIZE IT AND PROVIDE US WITH SOME SUBSTANTIVE RESPONSE ACTING. THAT'S WHAT I'M ASKING FOR. I THINK THE UNDERPINNING OF BOTH POLICY PROPOSALS BUFF BROUGHT FORWARD BY THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY. UP WERE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO THE LOWEST PERFORMING STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA. THE SLIGHT DIFFERENCES ARE. THE LANGUAGE APPROACH WHICH I TESTIFIED TO A PREVIOUSLY THIS WEEK. ON AND THE FINAL PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT PACKAGE HAS ONE TIME FUNDING APPROPRIATED FOR THIS PURPOSE VERSES THE ASSEMBLIES VERSION WHICH HAD AN ONGOING FUNDING STREAM. BUT THE POLICY UNDERPINNINGS OF BOTH PROPOSALS ARE VERY SIMILAR AND I THINK ENCOMPASSED IN THE CONFERENCE COMPROMISE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER BLOOM. NEITHER. QUESTIONS CENTER SKINNER. I. WANT TO ADD THAT I'M VERY PLEASED THAT. WE HAVE. A GOOD AMOUNT OF FUNDS PROVIDER SCHOOLS AND THAT WE ARE INCREASING THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. THOUGH I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT WE WERE NOT ABLE TO MAKE THE ADJUSTMENT FOR SPECIAL ED. OR THE ON GOING. THE ABILITY TO DO THE ONGOING FUNDING FOR THE LOW PERFORMING STUDENTS BUT I THINK THIS BOTH OF THOSE THAT IN THE SPECIAL ED. NOT DIGESTING THAT. ON. IS STILL OF BED IN AREA THAT. PUTS A LOT OF OUR CHILDREN AND FURTHER AT RISK IN IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO COMMIT OURSELVES TO CONTINUING TO. ADDRESSING WORK ON. THANK YOU SENATOR. ANY OTHER COMMENTS SIMILAR. I MAYBE MISSED CASA YOU COULD EXPLAIN. THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY TAKING CARE SPECIAL EDUCATION PRETTY THOROUGHLY AND. ISSUE SEVEN TWO TO BALANCE IT OUT SO WAS A CONCERN OF MINE. BECAUSE WELL AS PART OF SUB ONE. I WANT TO JUMP TO FAR AHEAD BUT WE DO HAVE A TEACHER RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION UP BOZELL THAT THE ADMINISTRATION INCLUDED. I'M SPECIFICALLY FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS AND SO ALTHOUGH THE PROPOSAL WAS FOR SPECIAL ED EQUALIZATION WHICH WOULD. BE AN ON GOING FUNDING SOURCE WE DO HAVE SAN AND. DOLLARS BILL TEND TO HAVE INCREASED THE NUMBER OF SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS IN CALIFORNIA WHICH HAS BEEN A HISTORIC SHORTAGE AREA FOR THE STATE. A MOVIE I ITEM. GREAT DRAGON A SECOND TO MOVE FARTHER COMPASS COMMITTEE COMPROMISE THE CONFERENCE COULD CUT. SENATE MITCHELL. I WAS JUST. ALSO AS WERE. NOT TO JUMP AHEAD BUT AS WE THINK ABOUT THIS POPULATION.

OUTWEIGH THE LOSS IN THE IN THE IN THE LC FF FUNDING BUT AS WE TALK ABOUT THIS HIGH NEED POPULATION RECOGNIZING THE EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION THAT THERE'S INVESTMENT ALSO SO WE CAN GET TO THAT LATER ON THE AGENDA BUT IT JUST OCCURREDTO ME THAT WE WANT TO.

THANK YOU MISS COSTA. SENATOR MORLOCK. CHAIR OF THIS COST OF. A QUICK QUESTION TO THE NEXT ITEM ISSUE THIRTEEN. SEEMS TO HAVE A STRONGER ONGOING SUPPORT FOR THE CSU VERSES. THE UC AND SINISTER SORT OF SISTERS I JUST KINDA. CURIOUSWHY THE DIFFERENCE. I WOULD ACTUALLY KNOWN I DON'T WANNA SKIP AHEAD TO FAR BUT THERE'S ALSO A ONE TIME COMPONENT IN THE C. ISSUE BUDGET YOU ARE RIGHT THERE IS AN ONGOING COMPONENT TO THIS YES YOU. BUT BOTH SEGMENTS ACTUALLY AS PROPOSED HAVE SOME A ONE TIME MONEY. ON AND I THINK. IT'S SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WHEN WE GET TO SEE ISSUE ON THE ONE TIME BECAUSE HOUSE TO DO WITH AND. I THINK BLENDING THEIR GRADUATION INITIATIVE FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA I THINK. THERE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT ITEMS HERE EONS. SOME OF THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE OVERALL PRIORITIES. OF GENERAL FUND SPENDING IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE BUDGET ITSELF. SO YOU THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY IT. SORT OF BALANCES OUT THE. ONE TIME MONEY GOING TO UC'S. COMPARABLE TO THE ONGOING. GOT GOING TO THE CSU. I DON'T KNOW IF IT BALANCES OUT BETWEEN THE TWO SEGMENTS I THINK THAT FUNDAMENTALLY THEY SERVE VERY DIFFERENT STUDENTS AND. DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF STUDENTS CANDIDLY BETWEEN THE SEGMENTS. I THINK THAT IT BALANCES THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE BUDGET IN WHICH ALL WE WANTED TO LIMIT OUR ONGOING RESOURCES AND BUILD UP. PRETTY. ROBUST RESERVE FUNDS. OKAY. CHAIR. ARE. YOUR YOUR MATERIAL PROVIDES BULLET POINTS. SO YES IT'S KIND OF HARD TO SAY NUMBER FOUR OR. THE OR FOURTH.

I JUST LIKE TO BRIEFLY SAY IT ONCE AGAIN THAT. THERE IS NO LIMIT ON THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE CAN PUT IN THE SPECIAL FUND FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY. SO THE ONLY REASON FOR CREATING. A THIRD TYPE OF ACCOUNT THE BUDGET DEFICIT SAVINGS ACCOUNT WOULD BE TO AVOID. LOWERING THE STATE SALES TAX RATE WHICH WILL HAPPEN AUTOMATICALLY IF WE PUT MORE MONEY IN THE US AFTER YOU'VE SO. POPULAR REASON I POSE THIS I THINK THAT IT'S APPROPRIATE TO. OFFER THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA TO TO SHARE IN THAT TAX SAVINGS. THANK YOU SIR MORLOCK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I'D LIKE TO HAVE. MISS COST TO REBUT THAT REMARK. I'VE OFTEN TESTIFIED THAT WE BELIEVE IN PRUDENT FISCAL RESERVES.

THAT FREQUENTLY HAVE CASELOAD INCREASES DURING A RECESSION WHEN WERE OFTEN FACE WITH CUTTING THOSE PROGRAMS. IN A SIMILAR VEIN WE SUPPORT THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL WHICH WOULD PROVIDE A HOLDING ACCOUNT OF SORTS FOR THE BSA TRANSFER. ON INTEL WE KNOW BASED ON TRUE UP THE TOTAL AMOUNT NEEDED FOR THAT DEPOSIT. THEN. STATEMENT MADE THAT. TING UP A SEPARATE WOULD. MAYBE I'LL A LOOPHOLE OR IN AROUND OR WHATEVER FOR THE SALES TAX. TERMINATION COMPONENT OF WHAT THEY GOES PROPERTY FIVE SO I JUST. CHRIS IS THAT ACCURATE. I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS I CAN ONLY TELL YOU WE SUPPORT ROBUST RESERVES AND THE INCLUSION OF TWO ADDITIONAL SOMETHING THE ADMINISTRATION SUPPORTS. WELL YOU CAN OPEN A. COUNT ON YOUR CHART OF ACCOUNTS EMIL TIME I'M. CHOMSKY I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT BECAUSE I WANT RESERVES. I'M WITH YOU BUT I BUT I WANT TO BE HONEST. AT LEAST BE ABLE TO TELL TAXPAYERS WHAT WE'RE DOING. I WOULD KNOW THAT BOTH OF THESE RESERVE FUNDS DO INCLUDE DEPOSIT MECHANIZATION SO I DON'T THINK IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT'S ON THE CHART OF ACCOUNTS THERE'S ACTUALLY DOLLARS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH. ADOPTED RESERVE AS PART OF THE BUDGET. WE HAVE A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION. THANK YOU SIR NIELSEN. ON THIS QUITE AS SOMEBODY WHO WORK FOR SO MANY YEARS FOR. PROP TWO. THE RESERVE. I'M. A LITTLE RESERVED ABOUT. CREATING A WHOLE. BUNCH OF NEW LITTLE. RESERVE FOR WHATEVER PURPOSE AND THERE WILL BE NO LIMITATION ON THE NUMBER OF PURPOSES THAT SOMEBODY'S GOING TO FIGURE OUT FOR SOME SORT OF RESERVE. PROSPECTIVELY. THAT COULD THEN BECOME A BIT OF A PROBLEM ALMOST LIKE THE GROWTH OF COLORS OVER THE DECADES HAS BEEN. IF WE'RE GOING TO PROCEED DOWN THIS PATH I WOULD REQUEST OF FINANCE AND THE LEGISLATURE'S WELL TO CONSIDER. SOME OF THE PARAMETERS THE CREATION OF THESE RESERVE ACCOUNT. IF WE DON'T IT'S JUST GONNA BE WILLING LA AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE ALL OVER THE PLACE AND WOULD BE FILL IN THESE BUCKETS FROM ALL COHEN'S KINDS OF SOURCES. AND THEY WILL BE CREATIVELY FOUND THE. THE KIND OF INTERESTING WAY THAT WE NOW DESIGNATE FEES AND DIRECTLY EAST OF THINGS. WELL I'M AFRAID THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO. BURGEONING. AND BUST SO. I WAX CAUTIOUS ON THIS IDEA.

THINK IT WAS BECAUSE I JUST CRIED FIVE THREE POINT TWO MILLION ON GOING FOR TO CORONA COURT JUDGESHIPS CORRECT YES I WAS I AM ADDING THE THREE POINT TWO IN THE ONE POINT TWO SO I APOLOGIZE. I'M SORRY. I APOLOGIZE. CORRECT SO COULD YOU SAY TO GET A BIPARTISAN ABSOLUTELY THERE'S TWO ITEMS THREE POINT TWO MILLION ONGOING FOR TO JUDGESHIPS IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY.

I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THESE JUDICIAL RESOURCES ARE BADLY NEEDED I THINK THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL CURRENTLY ESTIMATES THAT. STATEWIDE WE NEED MORE THAN A HUNDRED EIGHTY ADDITIONAL JUDGES JUST TO MEET THE CURRENT MADE AND IT'S GOING TO GET EVEN WORSE. BOB HOWEVER I HAVE A CONCERN THAT WE ARE VIOLATING LONG STANDING LEGISLATIVE PRACTICE HERE IN. EARMARKING THOSE TWO JUDGES FOR A SINGLE COURTHOUSE IN A SINGLE COUNTY. AND WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST WE HAD JUDGES AS WE LET THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ALLOCATE THEM ACCORDING TO THE JUDICIAL NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND THAT PREVENTS. JUDGE SHIPS FROM BEING A POLITICAL FOOTBALL SO I LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION THAT WE APPROVE THIS REQUEST BUT WE ALLOCATE THOSE JUDGESHIPS. ACCORDING TO THE JUDICIAL NEEDS ASSESSMENT AS WE HAVE DONE IN THE PAST. OKAY WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND LISTENER MORLOCK. I APOLOGIZE MISTER CHAIR I JUST THE MYTHOLOGY THAT SIR IF IF IF AN APPELLATE COURT JUDGE RIVERSIDE COUNTY COSTS ONE POINT TWO MILLION. THAT IS WHY WE. BUT BUT BUT IT BETTER THIS APP AS SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE COSTS ONE POINT SIX. SO IF WE APPROVE THREE POINT SIX MILLION IS AT A. THREE POINT TWO MILLION COULD WE GET THREE JUDGES I DON'T A PROSPEROUS FUNDS CAN ANSWER QUESTIONS. SO A PART OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO COSTS AND THERE THERE'S DIFFERENT AS I GUESS YOU COULD ALL STANDARD COMPLIMENTS THAT COME WITH EACH. TYPE OF JUDGESHIP SO THE THE ONE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS OF FOR THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY JUDGESHIPS. ALSO INCLUDES A BAILIFF FOR EXAMPLE WHICH IT DRIVES AN ADDITIONAL COSTS OVER AT FOR EXAMPLE THE ONE POINT TWO MILLION THAT YOU'RE REFERENCING FOR THE APPELLATE COURT JUSTICE SO THAT'S KIND OF ONE OF THE MAIN MAIN DRIVERS OF THE COST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO IF THAT'S HELPFUL. IT'S HELPFUL. YOU THINK YOU SO WE DO HAVE. OF MISTER OBERNOLTE IS A MOTION TO APPROVE THE ITEMS BETWEEN NOT YOUR MARK THE TWO JUDGES IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY CRACKED INTO GIVEN TO JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO.
