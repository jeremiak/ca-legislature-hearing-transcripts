YOU KNOW THAT IS HOME TO WATER

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:58.570 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO IS HOME TO THE LOT OF

DIFFERENT INNOVATIONS THAT HAVE

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:01.373 region:rollup2
COME UP AND SO WE WANT TO TRY

00:33:59.905 --> 00:34:02.908 region:rollup2
AND CREATE A HARBOR ON THIS

THIS IS WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE.

00:35:50.515 --> 00:35:54.052 region:rollup2
HAD THE SPILLWAY.

00:35:51.616 --> 00:35:54.853 region:rollup2
COLLAPSED.

00:35:54.052 --> 00:35:56.521 region:rollup2
MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:35:54.853 --> 00:35:59.224 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WOULD HAVE JUST BEEN

00:35:56.521 --> 00:35:59.758 region:rollup2
OBLITERATED.

00:35:59.224 --> 00:36:03.294 region:rollup2
AND.

00:35:59.758 --> 00:36:05.497 region:rollup2
LIFE AS WE KNOW IT DOWNSTREAM.

00:36:03.294 --> 00:36:06.064 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE BEEN ERASED ALL OF

00:36:05.497 --> 00:36:09.034 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITIES WOULD HAVE

00:36:06.064 --> 00:36:10.502 region:rollup2
DISAPPEARED. BUT EVEN MORE SO.

00:36:09.034 --> 00:36:12.103 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IS THE

00:36:10.502 --> 00:36:14.906 region:rollup2
COLLAPSE OF THE WATER DELIVERY

00:36:12.103 --> 00:36:16.975 region:rollup2
SYSTEM? FOR TWO THIRDS OF THE

00:36:14.906 --> 00:36:18.109 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA ONE THIRD OF

00:36:16.975 --> 00:36:20.812 region:rollup2
THE WATER DOES COME FROM THE

00:36:18.109 --> 00:36:23.248 region:rollup2
COLORADO RIVER. BUT THE STATE

00:36:20.812 --> 00:36:25.483 region:rollup2
WATER PROJECT WHICH STARTS IN OR

00:36:23.248 --> 00:36:27.052 region:rollup2
AVAIL I SEE MY WATER COMES FROM

00:36:25.483 --> 00:36:29.120 region:rollup2
GOD EVERYBODY ELSE'S WATER COMES

00:36:27.052 --> 00:36:32.791 region:rollup2
FROM US.

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:34.426 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT HAPPEN ANYMORE.

00:36:32.791 --> 00:36:38.063 region:rollup2
IN WITHOUT SAID THE DELIVERY

00:36:34.426 --> 00:36:40.231 region:rollup2
SYSTEM OF THE WATER. WOULD HAVE

00:36:38.063 --> 00:36:42.467 region:rollup2
CREATED A HOLE IN THE

00:36:40.231 --> 00:36:43.968 region:rollup2
AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY. AND THAT

00:36:42.467 --> 00:36:46.471 region:rollup2
WHOLE WOULD STILL EXISTS TODAY.

00:36:43.968 --> 00:36:47.572 region:rollup2
AND MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE

00:36:46.471 --> 00:36:49.240 region:rollup2
ARE PUT THE NUMBERS TOGETHER.

00:36:47.572 --> 00:36:52.544 region:rollup2
BUT.

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:53.878 region:rollup2
WE SUPPLY EIGHTY PERCENT.

00:36:52.544 --> 00:36:56.114 region:rollup2
OF THE NATION'S.

00:36:53.878 --> 00:36:58.249 region:rollup2
FOOD.

00:36:56.114 --> 00:36:59.584 region:rollup2
FROM CALIFORNIA SO REALLY WOULD

00:36:58.249 --> 00:37:03.121 region:rollup2
HAVE CREATED.

00:36:59.584 --> 00:37:04.055 region:rollup2
A UNIQUE SITUATION MANY OF US

00:37:03.121 --> 00:37:06.424 region:rollup2
THAT LIVE IN THIS REGION WHICH

00:37:04.055 --> 00:37:08.293 region:rollup2
THE IF IF YOU'VE GONE TO.

00:37:06.424 --> 00:37:09.594 region:rollup2
IN THIS REGION YOU GOT A SLIGHT

00:37:08.293 --> 00:37:11.963 region:rollup2
PARK.

00:37:09.594 --> 00:37:13.998 region:rollup2
ADD IN SIX GRADE YOUR KIDS GO TO

00:37:11.963 --> 00:37:15.433 region:rollup2
THE SCIENCE CAMPS I KNOW THAT

00:37:13.998 --> 00:37:17.769 region:rollup2
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT MAKING

00:37:15.433 --> 00:37:19.871 region:rollup2
OROVILLE PART ABOUT FOR THE SIX

00:37:17.769 --> 00:37:21.539 region:rollup2
GRADE CENTER. BUT.

00:37:19.871 --> 00:37:24.008 region:rollup2
THE SAME THING WITH THE SIX

00:37:21.539 --> 00:37:26.010 region:rollup2
GRADERS WITH UPPER EDUCATION

00:37:24.008 --> 00:37:28.113 region:rollup2
IT'S WE HAVE ALL THE.

00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:29.948 region:rollup2
WE HAVE THE WATER WE HAVE THE

00:37:28.113 --> 00:37:31.282 region:rollup2
GEOLOGY WE HAVE THE FISH MISTER

00:37:29.948 --> 00:37:31.850 region:rollup2
TELL US WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT

00:37:31.282 --> 00:37:34.252 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE EVERYTHING THAT

00:37:31.850 --> 00:37:36.888 region:rollup2
THE.

00:37:34.252 --> 00:37:38.957 region:rollup2
EVEN GLOBAL HUB COULD USE WHEN

00:37:36.888 --> 00:37:40.592 region:rollup2
IT COMES TO WHAT WE GONNA DO FOR

00:37:38.957 --> 00:37:42.260 region:rollup2
THE NEXT GENERATION AND HOW

00:37:40.592 --> 00:37:43.695 region:rollup2
WATER CAN BE SUSTAINED.

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:45.029 region:rollup2
AND I'M IN FAVOR OF THIS AND I

00:37:43.695 --> 00:37:47.799 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE MY TIME HERE TODAY

00:37:45.029 --> 00:37:51.569 region:rollup2

ORVILLE. AND ALSO.

00:37:57.542 --> 00:38:00.345 region:rollup2
HOUSEBOAT MARINA IN SAUSALITO

00:37:59.778 --> 00:38:01.412 region:rollup2
WHERE I LIVE FOR SIXTY FIVE

00:38:00.345 --> 00:38:03.281 region:rollup2
YEARS.

00:38:01.412 --> 00:38:04.682 region:rollup2
SO MY LIFE IS INEXTRICABLY

00:38:03.281 --> 00:38:06.985 region:rollup2
CONNECTED TO CALIFORNIA WATER

00:38:04.682 --> 00:38:09.454 region:rollup2
HYDROLOGY AS ARE THE OTHER FORTY

00:38:06.985 --> 00:38:10.388 region:rollup2
MILLION PEOPLE IN OUR STATE.

00:38:09.454 --> 00:38:12.390 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO OTHER COMPONENT OF

00:38:10.388 --> 00:38:13.591 region:rollup2
OUR NATURAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:15.360 region:rollup2
IS SO CRITICAL TO CALIFORNIA. AS

00:38:13.591 --> 00:38:16.995 region:rollup2
OUR WATER SYSTEM.

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:18.429 region:rollup2
AND WITH THE BAY IN DELTA PLAN

00:38:16.995 --> 00:38:20.031 region:rollup2
THE DEBATE ABOUT THE TUNNELS

00:38:18.429 --> 00:38:22.200 region:rollup2
CONFLICTING DEMANDS AND WITH

00:38:20.031 --> 00:38:24.369 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CHANGE THE SITUATION IS

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:25.770 region:rollup2
EXTRAORDINARILY FRAUGHT.

00:38:24.369 --> 00:38:28.006 region:rollup2
THE ONLY WAY TO SORT THIS OUT IS

00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:30.441 region:rollup2
WITH GOOD DATA. IN RIGHT NOW THE

00:38:28.006 --> 00:38:31.743 region:rollup2
DATE IS ADEQUATE AND FRAGMENTED.

00:38:30.441 --> 00:38:33.011 region:rollup2
IT IS CRITICAL THAT THESE

00:38:31.743 --> 00:38:35.079 region:rollup2
DECISIONS WHICH HAVE HUGE

00:38:33.011 --> 00:38:35.580 region:rollup2
IMPLICATIONS.

00:38:35.079 --> 00:38:37.282 region:rollup2
BE INFORMED BY THE BEST

00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:38.583 region:rollup2
RESEARCH.

00:38:37.282 --> 00:38:40.185 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATING THE RESEARCH IN

00:38:38.583 --> 00:38:41.686 region:rollup2
ONE PLACE IS NOT ONLY ESSENTIAL

00:38:40.185 --> 00:38:42.654 region:rollup2
FOR CALIFORNIA.

00:38:41.686 --> 00:38:44.088 region:rollup2
BUT THIS RESEARCH WILL HAVE

00:38:42.654 --> 00:38:46.291 region:rollup2
GLOBAL IMPACTS.

00:38:44.088 --> 00:38:47.125 region:rollup2
AS WATER AND WATER QUALITY IS

00:38:46.291 --> 00:38:48.960 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER ONE CRISIS FACING THE

00:38:47.125 --> 00:38:50.461 region:rollup2
WORLD.

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:52.463 region:rollup2
I NOTED THE ANALYSIS THAT THE

00:38:50.461 --> 00:38:54.465 region:rollup2
REVENUE LOSSES ESTIMATED OF FIVE

00:38:52.463 --> 00:38:56.901 region:rollup2
HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION.

00:38:54.465 --> 00:38:58.203 region:rollup2
OVER SURVIVOR TWENTY THOUSAND

00:38:56.901 --> 00:39:00.104 region:rollup2
OVER THREE YEARS.

00:38:58.203 --> 00:39:01.639 region:rollup2
HOWEVER THE POTENTIAL LOSS AND

00:39:00.104 --> 00:39:04.342 region:rollup2
GAIN OF AND OPTIMIZE WATER

00:39:01.639 --> 00:39:05.443 region:rollup2
STRATEGY IS IN THE BILLIONS.

00:39:04.342 --> 00:39:07.045 region:rollup2
IF YOU ATTEMPT TO BALANCE ONE

00:39:05.443 --> 00:39:09.414 region:rollup2
AGAINST THE OTHER THERE IS NO

00:39:07.045 --> 00:39:10.815 region:rollup2
DETECTABLE EQUIVALENCY.

00:39:09.414 --> 00:39:11.950 region:rollup2
THIS IS A VISIONARY PROJECT THAT

00:39:10.815 --> 00:39:13.985 region:rollup2
WOULD BENEFIT OUR STATE WOULD

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:16.120 region:rollup2
BENEFIT EVERYBODY. I URGE YOU TO

00:39:13.985 --> 00:39:18.223 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION IS NOT

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:23.962 region:rollup2
JUST A GOOD DEAL IS IT IS AN

00:39:18.223 --> 00:39:24.596 region:rollup2
ESSENTIAL DEAL.

SEA.

00:39:25.697 --> 00:39:32.670 region:rollup2
WE ARE.

00:39:30.001 --> 00:39:35.206 region:rollup2
DIVISION. WE'VE BEEN AN ORDEAL

00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:35.773 region:rollup2
STARTED OUR CAMPING OR WILL IT

00:39:35.206 --> 00:39:36.474 region:rollup2
DECADE AGO THIS IS OUR TENTH

00:39:35.773 --> 00:39:38.009 region:rollup2
YEAR.

00:39:36.474 --> 00:39:39.577 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE DO IS

THIS.

00:57:41.692 --> 00:57:44.728 region:rollup2
I DO HAVE A FEW CONCERNS HOW

00:57:43.293 --> 00:57:46.229 region:rollup2
ABOUT CURRENT BILL.

00:57:44.728 --> 00:57:47.564 region:rollup2
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY WERE TRYING

00:57:46.229 --> 00:57:49.499 region:rollup2
TO INVOLVE OURSELVES IN FEDERAL

00:57:47.564 --> 00:57:51.068 region:rollup2
TAX LAW YOU KNOW WHETHER YOU

00:57:49.499 --> 00:57:52.836 region:rollup2
LIKE IT OR NOT THIS IS.

00:57:51.068 --> 00:57:54.404 region:rollup2
THE TAX CODE.

00:57:52.836 --> 00:57:55.706 region:rollup2
AND SO THESE FOLKS ARE TAKEN

00:57:54.404 --> 00:57:57.207 region:rollup2
ADVANTAGE OF THE LAWS AS IT'S

00:57:55.706 --> 00:58:00.177 region:rollup2
WRITTEN RIGHT NOW.

00:57:57.207 --> 00:58:02.379 region:rollup2
AND IN CALIFORNIA.

00:58:00.177 --> 00:58:04.247 region:rollup2
WE TAX THIS INCOME WE GET WE

00:58:02.379 --> 00:58:06.149 region:rollup2
TAXIS CAPITAL GAINS AS INCOME SO

00:58:04.247 --> 00:58:06.717 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE A LOOPHOLE IN

00:58:06.149 --> 00:58:08.585 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA SO IT SEEMS LIKE

00:58:06.717 --> 00:58:10.387 region:rollup2
WERE.

00:58:08.585 --> 00:58:13.190 region:rollup2
EIGHT YOU KNOW INSERTED HERSELF

00:58:10.387 --> 00:58:14.224 region:rollup2
INTO FEDERAL TAX LAW. AND IT

00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:15.959 region:rollup2
WILL RESULT IN A SEVENTEEN

00:58:14.224 --> 00:58:17.561 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

00:58:15.959 --> 00:58:17.894 region:rollup2
TAX INCREASE ON THE FOLKS IN

.

00:58:19.997 --> 00:58:23.100 region:rollup2
AND IT'S IT IT SEEMS TO ME AS

00:58:21.331 --> 00:58:24.901 region:rollup2
BEING KIND OF PUNITIVE AND

00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:26.636 region:rollup2
PENALIZES THIS INDUSTRY.

00:58:24.901 --> 00:58:28.205 region:rollup2
UNTIL THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:58:26.636 --> 00:58:29.673 region:rollup2
ADDRESSES IT.

00:58:28.205 --> 00:58:30.640 region:rollup2
AND THEN YOU HAVE A SUNSET IN

COMPETITIVE.

01:17:14.597 --> 01:17:18.968 region:rollup2
AVAILABILITY OF SUPPLY IN THE

01:17:16.832 --> 01:17:21.303 region:rollup2
LIST OF MARKET MAKES IT POSSIBLE

01:17:18.968 --> 01:17:23.405 region:rollup2
FOR CONSUMERS TO TOGGLE BACK AND

01:17:21.303 --> 01:17:24.907 region:rollup2
FORTH BETWEEN THE TWO MARKETS.

01:17:23.405 --> 01:17:26.909 region:rollup2

SIXTY PERCENT OF CONSUMERS

01:17:31.514 --> 01:17:36.519 region:rollup2
OR TWO POINT ONE MILLION.

01:17:34.183 --> 01:17:39.255 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WILL BE PURCHASING IN THE

01:17:36.519 --> 01:17:40.523 region:rollup2

PERCENT EXCISE TAX.

01:17:42.324 --> 01:17:45.828 region:rollup2
AND THE TEMPORARY SUSPENSION OF

01:17:44.193 --> 01:17:48.063 region:rollup2
THE CULTIVATION TAX WOULD

01:17:45.828 --> 01:17:49.732 region:rollup2
THEORETICALLY INCENTIVIZE

01:17:48.063 --> 01:17:52.067 region:rollup2

01:17:49.732 --> 01:17:54.003 region:rollup2
LEGAL SYSTEM.

01:17:52.067 --> 01:17:55.671 region:rollup2
AND WILL MAKE THE PRODUCERS MORE

01:17:54.003 --> 01:17:58.040 region:rollup2
COMPETITIVE WITH RESPECT THE

01:17:55.671 --> 01:17:59.975 region:rollup2
ILLICIT MARKET SUPPLIERS.

01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:01.610 region:rollup2
A FOUR PERCENT REDUCTION IN THE

01:17:59.975 --> 01:18:03.646 region:rollup2
STATE EXCISE TAX FOR EXAMPLE. WE

01:18:01.610 --> 01:18:05.414 region:rollup2
WOULD EXPECT TO SEE AN INCREASE

01:18:03.646 --> 01:18:06.415 region:rollup2
IN LEGAL PARTICIPATION BY ONE

01:18:05.414 --> 01:18:07.850 region:rollup2
HUNDRED NINETEEN THOUSAND

01:18:06.415 --> 01:18:09.185 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS.

01:18:07.850 --> 01:18:10.719 region:rollup2
GENERATING AN ESTIMATED

01:18:09.185 --> 01:18:12.354 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY

01:18:10.719 --> 01:18:14.590 region:rollup2

REVENUE.

01:18:14.590 --> 01:18:19.528 region:rollup2
ASSUMING THAT THE. ILLICIT

01:18:16.458 --> 01:18:21.130 region:rollup2
MARKET IS EVENTUALLY MINIMIZED.

01:18:19.528 --> 01:18:22.398 region:rollup2
THE RESULT WOULD EVENTUALLY BE

01:18:21.130 --> 01:18:24.233 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:18:22.398 --> 01:18:26.135 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS HAVE FEWER SUPPLY

01:18:24.233 --> 01:18:28.537 region:rollup2
OPTIONS.

01:18:26.135 --> 01:18:29.772 region:rollup2
DEMAND WOULD BECOME LESS ELASTIC

01:18:28.537 --> 01:18:31.640 region:rollup2
AND TAXES COULD THEN BE

01:18:29.772 --> 01:18:32.408 region:rollup2
GRADUALLY RAISED.

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:34.510 region:rollup2
