YOU'VE GOT TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MR FOR TH I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- WELL THIS RUN TO LIKE LAST TIME AT THE THROUGH THE BILLS AND- HE COULD HAVE FOLKS ANSWER- WITH ANY ERA. CLARITY HOPEFULLY- IN TERMS OF SB ONE THIRTY ONE- IS IT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT MOST OF THE- CHECKERS LOTS. ARE ARE FUNDED THROUGH FEDERAL FUNDS IS THAT CORRECT. WITH THAT WITH A MIX OF THE STATE FUNDS TERRIFIED. YES THERE ARE THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION MR FONG- THERE ARE A MAKES A FINE STEP ON THE SLOTS AND SPECIFICALLY OPEN FOR THAT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE HI JENNIFER LOPEZ WITH. GOOD AFTERNOON JENNIFER LOPEZ DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT IS CORRECT- PORTION OF THE SPONSOR FUNDED WITH FEDERAL FUNDING AND IN GENERAL FUNDS. OKAY BUT IS THAT. BY THE FOR THE FEDERAL FUNDING MAKES UP MOST OF THEM HAVE I THINK A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE CHILD CARE SLOTS IS THAT CORRECT. THAT IS CORRECT APPROXIMATELY THREE QUARTERS OF THE FUNDING AND BUDGET YEAR IS FUNDED WITH FEDERAL FUNDING OKAY. SO I'VE I'D LIKE TO GET THE DEPARTMENT YOU'RE A PART FINANCES PERSPECTIVE SO- IT IT STARTS OUT. WITH A HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND SLOTS IN APRIL TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND THEN ADDS TWENTY THOUSAND SLOTS IN EACH SUBSEQUENT YEAR. THE FUNDING. FOR THIS BILL IS FOR TWO YEARS IS THAT CORRECT SO WHAT IS THE FUNDING SOURCE IS FOR THE- FOR THE ADDITIONAL YEARS TO GET THE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND IS THERE GOING TO BE A COMMITMENT AT THE GENERAL FUND. FROM THE STATE- AND WHAT IS THAT WHAT IS THE SOURCE OF THOSE FUNDING THAT FOR THE FUNDING STREAM MOVING FORWARD. MOST DEFINITELY JENNIFER LOPEZ DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO IN REGARDS SO IT WOULD KIND OF LOOK AT THE TWO FOLD SO THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE MAY REVISION INITIALLY PROPOSED A HUNDRED THOUSAND SPOTS. OF THOSE A HUNDRED THOUSAND SLOTS THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND WOULD BE FUNDED THROUGH GENERAL FUND FROM BUDGET YEAR ALL THE WAY ON THROUGH THE MULTI YEAR. IN REGARDS TO THE ADDITIONAL TWENTY THOUSAND SLOTS WE HAVE MADE A COMMITMENT TO PROVIDE INCREASED LOTS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS SUBJECT TO THE STATE'S ECONOMIC CONDITION I'M ASSUMING THAT THE STATE CAN ACT ECONOMIC CONDITION CAN CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE OUT YOUR GROWTH WE ARE SENDING TWENTY THOUSAND SLOTS WILL BE ADDED ANNUALLY. IN ADDITION TO THE SPOT SEAT MINISTRATION PROPOSED IN THE MAY REVISION THROUGH TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX. OKAY SO JUST USING THE ROUGH NUMBERS AND OF COURSE IF THE ABOUT SPECIFICS- CERTAINLY HAPPY TO HAVE THEM- SO YOU PROBABLY IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS THERE'S FUNDING FOR THE ONE TWENTY AND UNDER TWENTY THOUSAND SLOTS AND THEN PROBABLY ADDITIONAL TWENTY THOUSAND THE FOLLOWING YEAR. AND FORTY THOUSAND JUST BECAUSE THE BILL HAS TWO YEARS OF FUNDING AND THEN FOLLOWING THAT. THE ONE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND THAT IS THE INDEPENDENT ON. THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE THAT THE STATE HAS TO WHETHER YOU CAN HIT. ANOTHER. TWENTY THOUSAND FOR EACH SUBSEQUENT YEAR. THAT IS. OKAY SO AM I DON'T WANT TO GET MY CORRECT TO NOT ASSUME BUT TO SAY THAT HER FORTY THOUSAND FOR SURE AND THEN MOVING FORWARD HOPEFULLY HIGHER. CORRECT OKAY- IN TERMS OF A MOVING TO AT WORK SB ONE THIRTY THREE THE HEALTH CARE- THE BILL- IN TERMS OF THE DATA EXCHANGE FRAMEWORK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WILL BE CREATED AND MAINTAINED BY. DCHS IS THAT CORRECT. AND NOT THE PHARMACOLOGY OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT'S IT THAT'S IT THAT WILL BE MAINTAINED BY THAT AGENCY. IT WILL BE MAINTAINED BY THE- CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY AND- THIS IS WHEN I LOOK AT MY TICKETS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. APART THE AND WHAT DO THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO CREATE IN. GENERATE AND MAINTAIN THIS- THIS PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL NEW- I. T. SYSTEM. SO THE TWO POINT FIVE MILLION- ONE TIME GENERAL FUND INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET IS- TO GET- THE YOU KNOW TO START ORGANIZING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE AND THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR EXPECT EXPENDITURE FOR THREE YEARS. OKAY. AND WE SOLD WILL BE SAID THAT HHS WILL GO OUT AND SEE CONTRACTS. TO DEVELOP THIS IDEA THAT THIS THE DATA EXCHANGE. SO IT IT'LL BE A PROCESS SO THERE WILL BE A STAKEHOLDER ADVISORY GROUP- THAT WILL SORT OF- LOOK AT HOW BEST TO IMPLEMENT THIS- AND THEN IT ON JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE THERE WILL BE A- SINGLE DATA SHARING AGREEMENT THAT WILL BE- DEVELOPED- SO THE ACTUAL- DATA SHARING WON'T HAPPEN UNTIL. I THINK FOR AYE ONCE WE'VE OTHER MEMBERS BUT I. T. IS SIR CERTAINLY A CONCERN WHEN IT COMES TO- TO A NUMBER OF AGENCIES- SO I THINK THE CAPACITY AND CAPABILITIES ARE SELLING SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO- TO MONITOR- JUMPING TO THE- THE I. S. T. DEFENDANTS- ISSUE IF I COUNTY IS UNABLE TO- TO TAKE- TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR A DEFENDANT WHO IS INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL DO THEY HAVE AN OPTION TO WORK WITH A NEIGHBORING COUNTY HOW DOES THAT HOW DOES THIS AGREEMENT- OPERATE I KNOW THAT- MY COLLEAGUE- FROM THE EAST BAY HAD SIMILAR CHALLENGES ENGINE CONCERNS. SO WHAT WHAT'S HE AGREEMENT HOW DOES IT OPERATE I HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS HERE IN KERN COUNTY. AFTERNOON I JUST THINK IT'S WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO IF A FELONY INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL PATIENT OR A DEFENDANT WHO HAS. COMMITTED A FELONY I'M WHO IS DEEMED INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE. AND I BE ON THE STATE OF DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS SO- ESSENTIALLY SO IF IT'S A- A MISDEMEANOR I S. T. THAT WOULD BE THAT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COUNTIES. AND IN TERMS OF INTERCOUNTY AGREEMENTS FOR A MISDEMEANOR. AT PATIENTS I CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION OUT ABOUT THAT AND GET BACK TO YOU- AND PROMPTLY IF THAT WOULD WORK FOR YOU OKAY SO SAID THE PUSH OR THE EFFORT TO MOVE- INDIVIDUALS FROM STATE HOSPITALS TO COUNTY FACILITIES. THAT IS THAT STILL PROCEEDING AND THEN HOW IS THAT ADDRESSED- WITH THE LANGUAGE IN THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL. I KNOW GALGIANI IS A CONCERN ABOUT THAT I'M SORRY. NO OF COURSE- SO I JUST THINK IT'S WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AGAIN SO THE BUDGET INCLUDES RESOURCES FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS TO CONTRACT FOR SUB ACUTE BED CAPACITY WILL BE WORKING WITH OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PARTNERS- WHICH COULD BE A PUBLIC OR PRIVATE IN ORDER TO- YOU KNOW EXPAND OUR BED CAPACITY. SO TO BE WORKING WITH THE OTHER COUNTIES- TO DO THAT AND IT'S WHERE- IF THERE'S ALSO GOING TO BE A WORKGROUP- TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO THE I. S. T. PATIENT WEIGHTLESS PROBLEM SO THERE WILL BE OF LONG TERM MEDIUM TERM AND SHORT TERM SOLUTIONS IDENTIFIED IN THAT WORK GROUP. AND IN ORDER AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT PARTNERS WILL BE- INCLUDED IN THAT PROCESS OKAY SO WHAT WITH THE FUNDING BE USED SUPPORT FOR THE FOR THIS YEAR AS CURRENT YEAR WOULD THAT BE TO CONTRACT WITH COUNTY FACILITIES. EXISTING CAN IF IT LOOKS. IT COULD BE COUNTY FACILITIES- IT COULD BE INSTITUTIONS FOR MENTAL DISEASE OUR MENTAL HEALTH REHABILITATION CENTERS OR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES FOR EXAMPLE. OKAY I THINK THIS IS AN AREA CERTAINLY THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WATCH VERY CLOSELY I'M I'M CERTAINLY CONCERNED THAT THERE'S GONNA BE ADDITIONAL MANDATES ON THE COUNTIES- AND I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THE INFORMATION IN TERMS OF IF THE COUNTY DOESN'T HAVE CAPACITY. HOW THAT POPULATION GETS- ADDRESS WHETHER IT'S PARTNERING WITH THAT A NEIGHBORING COUNTY- IN TERMS OF THE HOUSING BILL WHEN IT COMES TO THE HOMELESSNESS FUNDING- THE FORMULA THAT'S PROVIDED. WHAT PERCENTAGE OF IT GOES TO URBAN CITIES AND WHAT PERCENTAGE GOES TO RURAL COMMUNITIES DO WE HAVE DO YOU HAVE THAT BREAK DOWN. TWO OF. MY SELF THANK YOU. BRAZIL THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THERE ARE SOME MONEY ASIDE FOR THE THIRTEEN LARGEST URBAN CITIES- AND- I DON'T HAVE AN EXACT SPLIT AS TO HOW MUCH IT'S GOING TO GO TO URBAN VERSUS APPROVAL HOWEVER BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT EVERY COUNTY IN THE STATE IS GOING TO RECEIVE A SHARE THE FUNDING. AND EVERY CONTINUE OF CARE IN THE STATE'S GONNA RECEIVE A SHARE OF THE FUNDING AND ALSO ORDER STERN CITIES UNIVERSITY THE SHARE OF THE FUNDING SO I CAN TELL YOU THAT EVERY ON EVERY LOCALITY IN THE STATE BECAUSE- RULES GOING TO GET A SHARE OF THIS MONEY OKAY SO THAT IS A- THAT IS A DIRECT. ALLOCATION TO. EACH CITY COUNTY IN CONSUMER CARE IT DOESN'T PASSED THROUGH ANYTHING- IT IS IT'S ON A GRANT THAT THEY HAVE TO APPLY. CORRECT FOR THE HOMELESS HOUSING ASSISTANCE AND PROGRAM- THE HELP MONIES THE MONTH AND THE LOCAL HAVE TO APPLY TO RECEIVE THE ONES- THAT'LL THAT'LL GET BUT- I'M HOMES CORNING FINANCING. ALSO A PLAN FOR HOW THEY'RE GONNA EXTEND THE MONIES AND HOW THEY'RE GOING TO ACHIEVE MEASURABLE METRICS FOR. REDUCING THEIR- ALMOST MISSED PROBLEMS AND THEN THEY WILL RECEIVE THOSE MONEYS FROM HDFC HOW MONSTER PLANS BEEN APPROVED. OKAY AND THEN IN TERMS OF METRICS HOW DO YOU DEFINE SUCCESS. WITH THE USE OF THESE RESOURCES. WHICH I WHICH I BELIEVE IS NECESSARY. YES AN ECONOMY IS REALLY BEDROCK THIS PROPOSAL I THINK. AND WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS YOU WILL EACH LOCAL. APPLICANT POOLS- SET IT WILL SET A GOAL SET MEASURABLE GOALS THAT METAL METRICS RATHER THAN ACHIEVE. SUCCESS AND IN A WORK COLLABORATIVE WITH THE HOUSING COURT MEETING FINANCING COUNCIL FOR TO ACHIEVING THE BULK OF BILLS. AND THEN THEY WILL RECEIVE FUNDING TO HELP. MEET THOSE GOALS IN FUNDING FOR THE FUTURE WOULD DEPEND UPON OUR PROGRESS TOWARD ACHIEVING THOSE GOALS. SO AGAIN ACCOUNTABILITY AND MEASURABLE METRICS TOWARDS RESOLVING ALMOST AS IF YOU ARE A KEY TO THIS PROGRAM. SO I WANT TO FOCUS ON THAT BECAUSE THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT SO. THE MEASURABLE GOALS SO WHAT NUMBER DO THEY USE IS AT THE POINT TIME COUNT IS IT A COMBINATION. OF- DIFFERENT DAY. IS ALONG WITH THE POINT TIME COUNT- WHAT'S THE BASELINE AND THEN AND THEN BECAUSE THAT BASS LINES THAT ARE MEANT A WHOLE LOT OF. OF WHAT. WE SEE AS MEASURABLE SUCCESS OR FAILURE. YES THE BASE PLANS GOING TO BE THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN COULD COUNT WHICH IS THE MOST ACCURATE THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY WASN'T. DONE UNIFORMLY THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE AND ALSO TWO THOUSAND TWENTY DID NOT INCLUDE ACCOUNT OF THE- UNSHELTERED HOMELESS SO WE'RE USING TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TED WHICH VOTERS OF COLOR PICTURE WE BELIEVE. OKAY SO THE TWENTY NINETEEN PIC COUNT WILL BE THE BASS LINE THAT WE'LL WILL JUDGE THE SUCCESS OR FAILURE OF THIS SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT. TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTOOD YES SO IT'S LOW THAT'S CORRECT AGAIN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WILL BE THE BASE AND THEN EACH LOCAL APPLICANT WILL DEVELOP A PLAN TO- TO A TRIP THAT NUMBER SO TO SPEAK AND REDUCE THE NUMBER OF. HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY AND THEY WILL WORK COLLABORATIVELY ON THAT PLAN WITH THE HOMELESS CORDY FINANCING COUNCIL AND- SO IT IS NOT GONNA BE ABLE OF COURSE TO SETTING THE VETERANS ON THEIR OWN IT'S GOING TO BE THEY'RE GOING TO BE WORKING WITH IT CSE. SO IT'S YES YOU CAN INSURE THOSE METRICS ARE REALISTIC AND ACHIEVABLE AND SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE THAT THE STATE AND LOCAL WORKING TOGETHER TO INSURE YOUR SETTING ACHIEVABLE REALISTIC GOALS OKAY AND THOSE AND THOSE GOALS WILL BE POSTED SO WE'LL KNOW. WHAT THOSE GOALS ARE SO WE KNOW WHAT KERN COUNTY'S GOAL AS WE KNOW WHAT LOS ANGELES GOALS IS WE KNOW WHAT THANK. ONE IS THAT IS THAT. KIND OF HOW IT'S GONNA BE A GENTLEMAN MEMBER. BOB HAILING A MEMBER EACH- EACH. XCSE WILL POST EACH- EACH APPLICANT'S PLAN CONTROLS OUR WEBSITE OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I TAUGHT A CLASS FOR ONE THING I SENT OF THE DISTRIBUTION IS BASED ON PREVIOUS YEAR SO IT'S BASED ON A PERCENT IT'S ABOUT THE PERCENTAGE BASED ON THE POPULATION. OF THE TWENTY NINETEEN PECAN AND SO THAT'S HOW IT GETS DISTRIBUTED TO THE CBO SEES THE CITIES AS WELL AS THE COUNTIES- ALSO. THE- THERE IS THERE IS A CAP SO THAT NO ONE ENTITY CAN GET MORE THAN FORTY FIVE PERCENT. OKAY SAID THIS SAID THAT THE ALLOCATION OF FUNDS WILL BE A PERCENT IS BASED ON POPULATION GROWTH- OF- THE HOMELESS POPULATION- BUT THAT HOMELESS POPULATION IS THE TWENTY NINETEEN CORRECT TOTAL POPULATION THAT'S OKAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. UP YEAH IT TO THE RESOURCES- BILL- WENT. ONE FORTY EIGHT- WITH THE END I GUESS THERE'S A AN INCREASE IN THE IN THE FEE OF PER BARREL O OIL- FROM SIXTY FIVE CENTS EIGHTY FIVE CENTS- WHERE DID THOSE PROCEEDS GO AND- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO THE AVERAGE CONSUMER- IS THERE CONCERN OF THE- THE OF THE IMPACT ON THE PRICE PER GALLON OF GASOLINE. YEAH THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- I WILL TURN IT OVER TO. OUR SPECIFIC TO MY COLLEAGUES BUT I BELIEVE THE INCREASE IS A PER BARREL FEE FROM SIX POINT FIVE CENTS TO EIGHT POINT 5% I'M SORRY THAT I READ THAT WRONG SIX POINTFIVE CENTS. TO EIGHT POINT FIVE CENTS. YES DRIVE OVER THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SO THE FEE INCREASE IS INTENDED TO ADDRESS A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT AND THE BALLOT FUND. WHICH SUPPORTS- DIFFERENT- CAN REGULARS GOOD ACTIVITIES FOR THE OFFICE OF OIL SPILL PREVENTION AND RESPONSE- AND SO. AS PART OF LAST YEAR. PROVIDE A LOAN TO THE FUNDED GIVEN THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT. BUT THIS- FEE INCREASE WOULD ADDRESS THAT **** UP WITH IT WHICH BASICALLY JUST MAINTAINS THEIR THEIR CURRENT EXPENDITURE LEVEL- WE DID DO HAVE ECONOMIC. IMPACT REVIEW TO SEE WHAT POTENTIAL IMPACT THAT WOULD HAVE ON- THE CONSUMER AND SO THE TWO PURPOSE AND INCREASE AND FEDERAL WOULD RESULT IN APPROXIMATELY 4% OF A PENNY. AT THE GALLON AT THE PUMP. 4% OF THE VALUE OKAY- I GUESS THE QUESTION WOULD BE IF THERE'S A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT AND THERE ARE OTHER STRUCTURAL DEFICITS IN A LOT OF ACCOUNTS THROUGHOUT THE BUDGET WHY NOT WITH THE SURPLUS- USE THE AT THE ADDED RESOURCES THAT CAME TO THE STATE PURSES OF A FEE INCREASE. THIS IS A DEBATE FUND THAT YOU KNOW PER STATUE. THAT THE REVENUE SOURCE THAT FUND THESE ACTIVITIES FOR- THE AUTHOR THE WORLD PROFESSIONAL RESPONSE SO WE THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE TO CONTINUE FUNDING THE STATUTORY MANDATED WORK OF THAT OFFICE- WITH THEIR DESIGNATED- FUND FOR EVERY. SO LET ME CHALLENGE YOU THEIR LITTLE BIT THERE OTHER FEE BASED FUNDS- I THINK- BUT A VEHICLE FUND IS A FEE BASED FUND BUT- BUT YOU'RE NOT RAISING THOSE FEES. FOR THEIR STRUCTURE WITH THEIR SON SOLVENCY ISSUES. MR FONG THANK YOU FOR THAT POINT I THINK IT GENERALLY- BUT WHEN THERE ARE ISSUES WITH PARTICULAR FUNDS WE TRY TO WORK WITH THEM. IN REGARDS TO WIN THEY MAY BECOME INSOLVENT AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE FUNDS THAT- WE'D- YOU KNOW IT'S TAKEN UP THIS YEAR- YOU HAVE A BROADER. QUESTION I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE LOOK AT EVERY YEAR AT VARIOUS OF FINES. AND FEES. MIGHT BE NECESSARY TO BE RAISED- AND YOUR POINT ABOUT THE DMV IS SOMETHING THAT YOU WE'VE LOOKED INTO THAT THE STATUS OF THAT FIND. ANNUALLY THE CIVICALLY BECAUSE THAT IS- ONE THAT MANY PEOPLE THINK IT TOO AND SO I THINK YOUR QUESTION IS MY PRIDE AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE LOOK AT ACROSS ALL SPECIAL FUNDS. OKAY I MEAN I GUESS THAT'S NOT MY POINT IS THAT THIS IS A CHOICE. EVEN BE MADE A POLICY DECISION AND- YOU WANT TO INCREASE THE STREET- EVEN THOUGH I THINK THAT THERE'S PROBABLY ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE. AND BUT THE IMPACT IT WILL BE TOO THERE WILL BE AN IMPACT OF THE CONSUMER I KNOW I'M NOT SURE THE 4% OF A PENNY IS COMPLETELY ACCURATE. BUT- I WILL SAY THAT. TO ROUTE RAISE A FEE FROM SIX POINT FIVE CENTS A POINT FIVE CENTS PER BARREL- WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE PRICE OF GASOLINE IN THE PRICE OF ENERGY IN GENERAL. AND I THINK THAT WITH. THE THAT NGUYEN FATHER SURPLUS I WANTED TO FIND OUT THAT WE HAVE NOW. IF IT IS AS IMMEDIATE AS YOU SAY IT IS. I THINK THAT YOU COULD PROBABLY BACK FILL IT WITH WITH THE S. P. ADDED SURPLUS- IN TERMS OF. IF YOU LOOK INTO THE BRING THE BILL I BELIEVE THERE'S- SEVERAL EXEMPTIONS FROM THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT- FOR PROGRAMS FUNDED THROUGH THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD- EXEMPTIONS- THAT COVER- ALTERNATIVES AG BURNING IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND THE SEVEN CENTER PROGRAMS. THERE HAVE BEEN. A NUMBER OF AUDITS- LED BY- OUR OUR FORMER A TRANSPORTATION CHAIR- CONCERNED ABOUT THE ACTIVITIES OF THEIR RESOURCES BOARD- AND THESE EXEMPTIONS PREVENT PUBLIC INPUT AND PARTICIPATION SO. HOW DID. HOW DID THESE EXEMPTIONS COME INTO PLAY WHO WAS CONSULTED AND WHAT'S THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THEM. YES AGAIN SIR DO I GOT WITH THE PART OF FINANCE AND SO CURRENTLY THE DIFFERENCE THERE ARE PROGRAMS THAT ARE PART OF THE EXEMPTION THEY THEY ALREADY DO HAVE B. A. P. EXEMPTION- WHEN THEY'RE FUNDED OUT OF CAP AND TRADE. AFTER THE THOSE KIND OF CONTINUATION OF THAT BUT GIVEN THAT WE FUNDED THE PROGRAMS WITH A MIX OF CAP AND TRADE AND GENERAL FUND. I WENT TO CUENTA THEIR GENERAL FUND AND THAT SAME EXEMPTION DOES NOT EXTEND ABSOLUTE MERELY JUST IT IS A REFLECTION OF. THE FUN SORT OF CHANGE THAT WE WANT THE PROGRAM TO HAVE THE SAME EXEMPTION IT CURRENTLY HAS- AND SO- IT REALLY JUST IS MORE OF A TECHNICAL BASED OFF OF THE FUND THAT- IS- FUNDING. THE PROGRAM THIS YEAR. OKAY I WOULD SAY THOUGH THAT IF YOU GONNA ON ONCE. YOU ERR ON THE SIDE. TOWARDTRANSPARENCY NOT AWAY FROM IT. WOULDN'T YOU AGREE. OR HAS THE OFFICE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW HAVE THEY BEEN CONSULTED WITH THIS DECISION. I THINK WHAT I WOULD HIGHLIGHT IS ESPECIALLY ON THE THEY ARE BE PROGRAM THEY DO HAVE YOU KNOW- PUBLIC PROCESS THE THROUGH THE BOARD IS JUST NOT THAT SAME. APA- PROCESS. BUT AGAIN JUST GIVEN THAT THE PROGRAMS CURRENTLY ALREADY DO HAVE. THE ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE AND THEN GET THE FUNDING OUT QUICKER RATHER THAN HAVING TO RESTART THE PROGRAM. I WHICH AGAIN CURRENTLY ALREADY HAVE THE AB EXACT OKAY. WELL I WOULD SAY AS AS AS SOMEONE WHO SAT ON THE COMMITTEE THAT REVIEWED THE AUDIT. INCLUSIONS I THINK THAT THAT THERE IS SEVERE CHALLENGES WITH IN CAR. WHEN IT COMES TO- THEIR ABILITY OR CAPACITY TO OVERSEE THESE PROJECTS AND I THINK MORE TRANSPARENCY IS PROBABLY NECESSARY- TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE FUNDS ARE BEING USED PROPERLY- AND I AM CONCERNED THAT. EXPANDING THESE EXEMPTIONS ACTUALLY MOVES US IN THE WRONG DIRECTION- INTIMATE AND THAT MAY BE SOMETHING THAT- WE NEED TO HAVE A BROADER COMMITTEE- CONVERSATION ABOUT- BUT THAT THINGS ITS IT'S- SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO BE COGNIZANT OF- AND I'M- I'M DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT- JUMPING TO YOU- TO BROADBAND- WHY IS THE SEQUEL EXEMPTION LIMITED TO THE MIDDLE MILE WHY NOT APPLY IT TO THE MIDDLE MILE AND LAST MILE. HI MISTER BY WILL TURN THAT QUESTION OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE. NUMBER ONE- TO PARTLY FINANCE. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE SEQUENCE ACTIONS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT IT'S REALLY MORE OF A STREAMLINING RIGHT AND SO- YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT- ON WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT USING. LAND ALONG STATE HIGHWAYS SO THERE'S ALREADY IN YOUR ROBUST ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS THAT HAS BEEN FOLLOWED- TO PUT THE ROAD THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE IS A LOT OF INFORMATION WHERE BEHALF SO REALLY. IT'S NOT- AND BECOME A CONDUIT AND ALREADY EXEMPTION- BUT IT'S REALLY JUST TRYING TO CAPITALIZE ON. THE WORK THAT THE CALTRANS IS ALREADY DONE- AND- IT IS TO SPEED THE PROJECT ALONG- IT WOULD BE MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE AND WE CAN'T REALLY SPEAK TO WEAR IN TERMS OF THE LAST MILE WHERE THAT WOULD GO- THEN THAT'S THAT'S REALLY UP TO THE PROVIDERS TO KIND OF CONTROL THAT SO. WE JUST MADE IT TO THE MIDDLE MILE OKAY WELL LET ME USE YOUR LANGUAGE THEN SO LET'S SAY IT'S EQUESTRIAN RIDING RIGHT I WOULD SAY THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO MAKE OUR DOLLAR GO FURTHER. IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO APPLY IT TO THE MIDDLE MILE AND LAST MILE WOULDN'T YOU AGREE. TO THE EXTENT THAT. I THINK WE CAN ONLY SPEAK TO THE- TO THE SEQUEL PROCESSES THAT CALTRANS ALREADY FOLLOW THE BODY FOUND ON THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM- AND WE- THERE'S NOT WE DON'T HAVE THAT SAME LEVEL OF INFORMATION FOR. WHAT'S THE I WOULD SECTOR WOULD BE DOING IN TERMS OF PROVIDERS YEAH WE'RE GONNA GO TO THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AS WELL- ANSWER MISTER CHAIR THIS SECTION OF THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE ON THIS PARTICULAR- SEQUEL EXEMPTION- IT PLUS THE RIGHT OF WAYS AND IT CAN ACTUALLY IS A ELIGIBLE FOR THE MIDDLE MILE OR FOR NONPROFIT OR EVEN A FOR PROFIT PROVIDERS LONG AS IT'S ALONG THE RIGHT AWAY TO THE EXEMPTIONS REALLY ABOUT WHERE THE WHERE THE LINE IS LAID NOT WHETHER IT'S MIDDLE MILE THE LAST MILE IT'S JUST WHETHER YOU'RE USING THIS RIGHT AWAY FOR THAT OKAY SO ANY. SO ANY. ANY PROJECT THAT IS ON EXISTING RIGHT AWAY IT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS. THE LIMITED- GROUP OF THE GIFT RIGHT OF WAYS BUT YES IF IT IF IT IS THE RIGHT AWAY IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT MENTAL MINE A LOT OF MILEAGE HAVE TO BE USED OKAY. I SEE I SEE YOUR POINT I THINK FOR THOSE OF US IN IT WHO HAVE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED A SEQUEL- FOR A LOT OF PROJECTS WHETHER IT'S ROADS OR ANYTHING ELSE IT TENDS TO BE CUMBERSOME IT TENDS TO BE VERY LINK THEY TEND TO BE LOOKS POOR EXPENSIVE SO. IF WE CAN RUN THAT OUT I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO- TOOK TO LOOK AT- AS WELL- I GUESS IT'S BACK TO THEBOMBING OF FINANCE JUMPING TO JUST METRICS AGAIN- A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY IS BEING. INVESTED I WANT TO SAY IT'S ABOUT FOUR POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS- SO HOW DO YOU DEFINE SUCCESS IS IT THE AMOUNT OF CONNECTIONS IT'S IS THAT THE AMOUNT OF COMMUNITIES THAT ARE BEING GET CONNECTED TO BROADBAND- APPLE. HOW DO WE KNOW WHAT. WHAT IS IN EUROPEAN. OVER THE MISSISSIPPI WHAT IS SUCCESS. WE HAVE. THE INITIAL MEASURE THAT WE HAD USED FOR OR THE- SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND A MONTH- COUNCILS OF THE STATE- AND THOSE ARE HOUSEHOLDS BUT PHYSICALLY DON'T HAVE. ACCESS TO BROADBAND SERVICE I'M SO CERTAINLY THE NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLDS SERVED- COME INTO PLAY COMMUNITY SERVICE. COME INTO PLAY- THERE ARE YOU KNOW LIKE A NUMBER FOR THE COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE THAT. THIS MONTH SAYS DON'T HAVE ACCESS AND SO. SHOULD BE REACHING OUT AND HAVING BROKER BE ABLE TO GET TO ALL OF THE COMMUNITIES. REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY ARE WOULD BE ANOTHER MEASURE. SO THE SIX SEVEN SEVEN FIVE THOUSAND UNSERVED THAT'S THE OTAL AMOUNT OF UNSERVED- HOUSEHOLDS IN CALIFORNIA. THE AND- THAT YOU HAVE THAT YOUR ACCOUNT. THAT IS WHAT. THE INDUSTRY HAS REPORTED TO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. IN TERMS OF WHERE. THEY ARE UNABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICE. SO AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO- THAT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION WILL CONTINUE TO REVISIT MARC ON. OKAY WELL I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AS THE LEGISLATURE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT NUMBER IS. SO IF THE NUMBER IS SIX ARE SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND UNSERVED. HOUSEHOLDS THE NEXT YEAR WHEN WE HAVE THIS DISCUSSION OF HOW THE MONEY IS BEING USED. I WOULD PRESUME THAT WE WOULD HAVE LESS OR WHATEVER THAT NUMBER IS SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY MEASURE. SUCCESS WHO IS THAT IS THAT BUILT INTO THE- INTO THE INTO THE PROJECT OR INTO THE FUNDING. HI MR YES IT IS YES THERE ARE THERE'S A REPORTING MEASURES IN THE BILL THAT ARE ACTUALLY TO THE BUDGET COMMITTEE SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS GOING PERFECT. AND THAT'S AND THAT'S GOING TO BE ANNUALLY WORKS EVERY MARCH EVERY MARCH YES. PERFECT AND THEN THIS IS. IT'S OVERSEEN BY DEPUTY WITHIN DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY IS THAT CORRECT. YES OKAY AND DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY HAS THE CAPABILITY OF. OF OVERSEEING THIS SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF WORK. YES OF THE- THE- SURE THE BILL PROVIDES FOR THE CONTRACT WITH A THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR AND SO- THE TECHNOLOGY THAT C. T. DOES HAVE A CERTAIN LEVEL OF EXPERTISE YOU KNOW. IT DIDN'T WORK IN UNDERSTANDING THAT. THE BROADBAND INDUSTRY INDUSTRY BUT- THIS IS VERY MUCH INTENDED TO DEPEND ON. THE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR THAT THEY WOULD CONTRACT WITH THAT WOULD- THAT UNDERPIN HAS AS A VERY THOROUGH AND IS INVOLVED IN THAT THEIR KNOWLEDGE EVIDENCE INVOLVED IN THE BROADBAND INDUSTRY. I'M SO I'M GONNA BE VERY DEPENDENT ON THEM OKAY WELL. I WILL BE ULLY TRANSPARENT WITH YOU THAT I CONCERNS ABOUT THE DEVICE TECHNOLOGY ARE PRETTY WELL FOUNDED IF YOU LOOK AT FISCALE. YOU LOOK AT THE I. T. PROGRAMS IN THE DMV YOU LOOK AT E. D. D. YOU LOOK AT CALVARY'S YOU EVEN LOOK AT THE MOST RECENTLY ARE ARE IN. THE STATE'S INABILITY TO DISTRIBUTE RENTAL ASSISTANCE. I THINK THAT THERE'S SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS OF THE CAPACITY AND SO WE'RE GOING TO INVEST IN I THINK RIGHTFULLY SO- FUNDING FOR BROADBAND AND CONNECTING- AND UNDERSERVED OR UNSERVED HOUSEHOLDS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MONEY GOES AS FAR AS POSSIBLE. AND AS EFFECTIVE AS POSSIBLE- I THINK THAT CONCLUDES MY QUESTIONS MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU MR VICE TO REMEMBER MISS FRIEDMAN. THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIR- FIRST I WANT TO- REALLY THANK YOU AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE WORK THAT YOU AND YOUR STAFF HAVE BEEN DOING FOR MANY MONTHS NOW ON THIS BUDGET I KNOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN WORKING NIGHT AND DAY OVER WEEKENDS. TRYING TO DEAL WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS THE STATE DEALING WITH PRETTY MUCH EVERY AREA- THAT WE FUNDS SO I WANTED JUST PERSONALLY THANK YOU FOR ALL OF THAT INCREDIBLE WORK. I DO WANT TO RAISE A CONCERN ABOUT- AB ONE FORTY IN TERMS OF THE SPENDING CAP- IT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME TO SAY. THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE SEND MONEY TO THE PLACES WHERE WE'RE EXPERIENCING THE MOST HOMELESSNESS AND THEN AT THE SAME TIME SAY AND WAS THAT PLACE HAPPENS TO BE LOS ANGELES. IT DOESN'T COST LESS PER PERSON TO SERVICE A PERSON ON THE STREETS IN LOS ANGELES AS IT DOES IN ANOTHER COUNTY OR ANOTHER CITY. IF LOS ANGELES CITY HAS THE HIGHEST POPULATION OF HOMELESS THEY SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT PER CAPITA AS ANY OTHER AREA OF THE STATE BECAUSE THIS IS THE EPICENTER OF OUR HOMELESS EPIDEMIC. AND SO I BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD BE SPENT AN EQUAL AMOUNT PER CAPITA ACROSS THE STATE AND NOT HAVE AN ARBITRARY CAP THAT SIPHONS MONEY AWAY FROM LOS ANGELES TO SEND IT TO OTHER AREAS WHERE THEY WILL RECEIVE MORE PER CAPITA- THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME UNLESS I'M MISUNDERSTANDING THIS IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. WE SHOULD BE SENDING MORE FUNDING INTO THE AREAS WHERE WE HAVE THE WORST HOMELESS PROBLEM MORE HOMELESS PEOPLE ARE CONGREGATING- WHERE. WE SEE THE HUGE IMPACTS OF HOMELESS PEOPLE- YOU KNOW WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ADDRESS THAT AND I EIGHT I DON'T UNDERSTAND ANY I CAN'T COME UP WITH ANY POLICY REASON WHY YOU'D WANT TO SPEND LESS PER CAPITA IN THE EPICENTER OF OUR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE. A FAMILY MEMBER FRIEDMAN I'M NOT SURE IF THERE'S- ABOUT THE QUESTION THAT I WOULD JUST ADD. THAT IN THE PAST WHEN WE HAVE- BUT CAPTAIN FOR HAP OR HOMELESSNESS SPENDING- IN REGARDS TO A LATE HUSBAND. WITH THAT. THE END TIMES THAT SOME OF THOSE DOLLARS HAVE- CAN ACTUALLY BE A BENEFIT. BENEFITS THEY'RE A BENEFIT THAT AREA DEGREE DEGREE BECAUSE OF THE SCALE- AND THE AMOUNT OF DOLLARS THAT ARE THAT ARE GOING TO THAT AREA SO THAT THEY CAN MAXIMIZE OUR TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT BUT I WILL TURN IT OVER TO CHRIS HOPE TO SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE THAT. WE ARE I WANNA MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT IS YOUR POINT THAT IT SOMEHOW BENEFITS LOS ANGELES MORE TO RECEIVE LESS FUNDING. NO NO AT. APOLOGIZE FOR THAT I THINK THAT WOULD THERE WAS THERE IS A SENSE THAT BECAUSE THEY ARE SO LARGE. THAT THEY HAVE- THAT THEY CAN BENEFIT FROM SCALE IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO MOVE BACKWARDS. AND OR OR- I WOULD PROVIDE THE SERVICES AND PROGRAMS AT AT AT AT AT AT BURKE FOR CHEAPER ESSENTIALLY WELL I WILL TELL YOU THAT THAT IS CERTAINLY NOT THEIR FEELINGS. I LOS ANGELES DOES NOT FEEL LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO BENEFIT ENOUGH FROM SCALE THAT THEY'RE WILLING THAT THEY THINK THAT THEY SHOULD RECEIVE LESS MONEY PER CAPITA THAN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE. I WOULD SAY THAT THEY HAVE A LOT OF REASONS WHY MAYBE IT'S HARDER TO SERVICE. THE HOMELESS POPULATION IN LOS ANGELES- NOT LESS DIFFICULT AND LOS ANGELES IS EXTREMELY CONCERNED ABOUT THE REDUCTION IN FUNDING- THEY ARE. FACING A HUGE ALMOST INSURMOUNTABLE. CRISIS WITH HOMELESSNESS- YEAH I MEAN I KNOW THAT THERE IS ISSUES IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE BUT I'M NOT FOR THAT THEY WERE APPROACHING AND MOST OF OUR AREAS. THE REAL SENSE OF ALMOST JUST HOPELESSNESS WHEN IT COMES TO THE GROWING HOMELESSNESS HOMELESS POPULATION. IN LOS ANGELES AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE TIME TO SITE TO TAKE MONEY OUT OF THAT SYSTEM AND SEND IT OTHER PLACES I JUST I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY. SOMEHOW IT SHOULD COST LESS MONEY TO SERVICE HOMELESS PEOPLE IN LOS ANGELES. AND APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEING FAIR I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ADD THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER BUCKETS OF FUNDS IN THIS- BUDGET NOT JUST IS THE HELP OF FUNDING- THAT- PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SERVICES MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AS WELL AS OTHER SERVICES HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS- BUT I DO WANT TO TURN IT OVER CHRIS COOK FOR. SOME SPECIFICS. YES CHRIS COOK WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- AS MISLI JUST INDICATED THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER FUNDING SOURCES IN THE BUDGET. THAT DEFINITELY L. A. COUNTY- CITY CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AND I WOULD JUST LIKE THE CARE- CLARIFY. THAT THE CURRENT METHODOLOGY ONLY REALLY IMPACTS- AT LAKE CITY L. A. R. THE CEO SEES IN THE AREA AND THE COUNTIES ARE NOT- HIT THAT THEY DON'T THEY WILL NOT HIT THAT CAP- AND I WILL ALSO NOTE THAT I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD NECESSARILY SAY IF A REDUCTION FUNDING. THIS YEAR'S BUDGET PROVIDES A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF HOMELESS FLEXIBLE EIGHT- THE LARGEST THAT THE STATE HAS EVER MADE IN THIS AREA WHICH IS ALMOST DOUBLE THE HIGHEST THAT WHAT IT'S RECEIVED IN THE PAST. AND I WOULD AND I WOULD SAY THAT A LAKE CITY SPECIFICALLY IS GETTING EIGHTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS MORE THAN THEY HAD RECEIVED IN THE PRIOR YEAR- WHICH IS A FIVE STAR AND YET NOT A REDUCTION FUNDING CERTAINLY COMPARED TO PREVIOUS YEARS. BUT THE REDUCTION OF PER CAPITA FUNDING COMPARED TO OTHER REGIONS SO ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT THERE'S OTHER POTS OF MONEY THAT LOS ANGELES CITY CAN ACCESS AND OTHER CITIES CAN'T ACCESS. OR AND ALL THESE ARE THESE CARE ACT AS MONEY OR MENTAL HEALTH SO I'M GONNA ANSWER THE QUESTION ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION WHICH IS. STILL LA CITY FOR THE NEXT YEAR IS GETTING A HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE. MILLION DOLLARS BY FAR THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF ANY CITY- IN THE ENTIRE STATE BECAUSE OF THE POPULATION. WHAT THEY ARE MISSING OUT ON THIS THIRTEEN MILLION SO. THEIR NEXT ELECTION IS FIFTY SIX MILLION- WHICH I WOULD HAVE AN ISOLATION IS INCORRECT. THE THEIR CALCULATION IS THAT IT'S A REDUCTION IN THAT NOT WITHOUT IT NOT A REDUCTION SORRY WITHOUT THE CAP. URATE REDUCTION IS ABSOLUTELY THE WRONG WE'RE GOING TO BE USING BECAUSE IT'S BASED ON AND OUR BUDGET CONSULTANT CAN WALK THROUGH THE CALCULATION BUT THEIR CALCULATION IS INCORRECT OKAY GENEVIEVE MORALE YEAH THEIR CALCULATION IS NINETY SIX MILLION AND MISLEADING THE- MANAGER OF THE COMMITTEE. SORRY SO WHAT I'M GONNA GO TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION THANKS WITH YOUR QUESTIONS AND THEN YOU CAN COME BACK TO HER HOUSE FOR THE QUESTIONS IN THE COMMENTS. HI JENNIFER MORALES WITH THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. AT GENERAL ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE I MISS FRIEDMAN I THINK WHERE THE CONFUSION COMES IN IS IN THE BILL WHAT WE DID IS WE PROVIDED A- UP. THE TOTAL IS ONE BILLION DOLLARS BUT WHAT DID IS WE PULLED OUT A BONUS POT SO THAT STARTS THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE POT OF FUNDING AT EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION AND I BELIEVE THE FUNDING THAT THE CITY OF ALLEY. PROVIDED FOR YOU WITH THAT ONE BILLION VERSUS EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION AT IN CURRENTLY IN THE BILL SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT THE NUMBERS THERE THE DELTA BETWEEN THE TWO IS FIFTY AROUND FIFTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS THAT THEY'RE SAYING THEY'RE LOSING BUT THAT'S BASED ON UP BILLION DOLLAR POT. AND THE WAY THE BILL READS IT'S BASED OFF OF AN EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR CAUGHT AND SO WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS THIRTEEN MILLION VERSUS FIFTY ONE MILLION SO I THINK THEY JUST READ THE BILL WHEN THEY SEND OUT THEIR THEIR LETTER TODAY. OKAY I WASN'T TRYING TO REPAIRS WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I GOT OUT WITH THEIR CONCERN WAS THAT THEY FELT THAT IT WAS A FIFTY SIX MILLION DOLLAR DELTA. SO THERE IS SO IN OTHER WORDS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT THERE THE INITIAL THAT THE SOME THEIR THEIR OVERSTAFFED OVERSTATING WHAT THE SOME WOULD BE SO THEY'VE DONE THE CALCULATION AND SO YOU'RE SAYING WHAT WHAT THE DIFFERENCE WOULD. BE IS FOURTEEN. THIRTEEN YEAH. YES BUT IS THIRTEEN MILLION WE THIS EIGHTEEN FOR BONUS POT SO THAT'S STARTS OUT WHAT ALLEN DAHLE ARE AT EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION SO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT IS WHERE THEY GET THEIR BIGGER NUMBER AND IF THERE'S I HAVE A DIFFERENCE OF FIFTY ONE MILLION AND THEY HAVE A DIFFERENCE OF FIFTY SIX MILLION BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T TAKE OUT THE ADMIN SO- IF YOU BASE IT OFF OF THE NUMBERS IN THE BILL THAT THE DIFFERENCE THAT ALLEY IS MISSING IS THIRTEEN MILLION AND IF YOU BASE IT OFF ELLIE'S LETTER THE DIFFERENCE EMPTINESS FIFTY SIX MILLION. SO I'M HAPPY TO SHARE I HAVE A COUPLE CHARTS AND HAPPY TO SHARE THEM WITH YOUR OFFICE TO PROVIDE MORE CLARITY THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL AND IT WOULD BE NICE IF I CAN GET A RESPONSE FROM LOS ANGELES BASED ON THAT- SO THAT WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT WE ALL HAVE THE SAME IDEA OF WHAT THE DIFFERENCES BECAUSE THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIRTEEN MILLION AND FIFTY SIX MILLION. I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND THE POLICY REASON WHY YOU WOULD GIVE PER CAPITA THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES WHICH IS THE EPICENTER OF A HOMELESS CRISIS LESS FUNDING PER CAPITA THAN YOU WOULD GIVE OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE IT'S STILL THAT JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY POLICIES AS ME BUT ALL I WILL LEAVE IT THERE AND THAT'S MY CONCERN MISS MISS MORALES CAN YOU WALK THROUGH THE FUNDING AMOUNTS FOR THE OTHER CITIES THE OTHER OF- FOURTEEN CITIES. AT THE OTHER. THE R. THESE. THE OTHER LIFESON. YEAH IN ORDER. OKAY HOLD ON ONE SECOND. ASSEMBLY MEMBER THING I HAVE THOSE AS WELL IF IT'S HELPFUL FEELS PLEASE READ OFFER WELL THANK YOU. THIS CONGRESS CUT FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ARE SO AND- ANAHEIM WOULD RECEIVE- TEN POINT THREE MILLION BAKERSFIELD THREE POINT NINE R. FOUR MILLION- FRESNO SEVEN POINT FIVE. LONG BEACH FIVE POINT SEVEN MILLION LOS ANGELES. A HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE POINT SIX MILLION OAKLAND TWENTY FOUR POINT ONE MILLION. RIVERSIDE EIGHT POINT FOUR SACRAMENTO SIXTEEN POINT SEVEN SAN DIEGO TWENTY SEVEN POINT THREE. SAN FRANCISCO TWENTY FOUR POINT ONE SAN JOSE TWENTY NINE POINT TWO. SANTA ANA TEN POINT THREE MILLION AND STOP AND SEVEN POINT NINE OR EIGHT MILLION. THANK YOU THINK MY ONLY COMMENT IS I THINK BASED ON THAT LISTING OF THE CITIES. YOU CAN SEE AND HEAR FAR AWAY THAT LA RECEIVES HE- LINE SHARE OF THE FUNDING WHICH I THINK IS APPROPRIATE GIVEN THE POPULATION AND I THINK. ARMED WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS I THINK IT'S A VERY APPROPRIATE FUNDING LEVEL SO. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MISSED FRAZIER- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. JUST WANT TO GO BACK TO THE- THE MENTAL HEALTH OF THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ASPECT OF WHEN- VISSCHER FONG AND TALKED ABOUT THE OF COUNTIES IN THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS I KNOW I ADDRESSES CONCERNS. OF PREVIOUSLY IN IN THE HEARINGS. AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. ADDITIONAL CAPACITY. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. STARTING FROM SCRATCH BASICALLY AND BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE THIS THIS- CAPACITY FOR THESE FOR THESE PATIENTS ARE GOING TO BE ESSENTIALLY TURNED OVER TO THE COUNTY- AND I THINK SOLANO COUNTY IT'S LIKE TWENTY HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE- THAT ARE NOW BEING. CONTRACTED THROUGH KAISER. AND LOOK I THINK IT'S EIGHT THOUSAND PLUS IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY I BELIEVE IT WAS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW PHASE IN AND AVAILABILITY AND BEING ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE IT AND MAKING SURE THAT THE INDIVIDUALS ARE BEING CARED FOR. FIRST AND FOREMOST- AND THEN ADEQUATE FUNDING IS THEN PROVIDED FROM THE DEPARTMENTS AT HOSPITALS TO THE COUNTIES CAPACITY I ONCE I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT TRANSITION. IS STREAMLINED AND SMOOTH AS POSSIBLE NOT TO INTERRUPT THE BASIC CARE FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE MORE EXTREME- MENTAL FRAGILE BY MENTALLY FRAGILE I WOULD SAY AND SO- THAT WAS THAT WAS THE FIRST AND FOREMOST ON MIKE HOW MAY YOU KNOW FOUGHT PROCESS THE OTHER ONE WENT IN AND I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE COME THE COMPONENT OF WORKING WITH SCHOOLS. IN THE MENTAL HEALTH AND BEHAVIORAL A CAPACITY BECAUSE YOU LOOK AT ALL THE SCHOOLS THAT I'VE GONE TO MY DISTRICT THEY HAVE IT IN THEIR EL CAP. BUT THEY DON'T THEY DON'T ACCOMMODATE. AND SO THIS GOING OUT AND BEING ACCOMPLISHED IS HUGE FOR- REDUCTION SUICIDES AND IN SO MANY DIFFERENT AREAS WHERE WE A LOT OF US AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO DATE ANYBODY BUT WE HAVE A GUIDANCE COUNSELOR THAT WE WOULD GO TO. THAT WE COULD TALK TO. I DON'T HAVE THAT NOW- THEY DON'T HAVE THAT CAPACITY SO. I'M JUST ALSO ASKING BECAUSE IN THIS MENTAL HEALTH ROLE- WE'VE SEEN THE DUAL DIAGNOSIS WITH THE ID DEEP POPULATION WERE WITH HAVE A- MAYBE A SEVERE AUTISM BUT THEY ALSO HAVE- MAYBE ANOTHER A MENTAL- OF. CHALLENGE AND WANT TO MAKE SURE IN THIS. IT'S BECAUSE SO MANY THINGS ARE SILOS. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT DDS AND- REGIONAL CENTERS AND THE SOME OF THEDIFFERENT THINGS WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS MENTAL HEALTH MONEY. ACCOMMODATES THAT ROLE ALSO IN WITH THE ID POPULATION CHRISTIAN I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN PRETTY WELL. CAN YOU TELL ME- IF IT'S SILENT AND IT HAS TO GO THROUGH DDS OR REGIONAL CENTER FOR THE FOR THE I. D. D. POPULATION OR OR CAN IT BE THROUGH THIS POSSIBILITY THROUGH SPECIAL EDUCATION. THROUGH THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. BUT IT'S FRAZIER I'M SORRY I TOP MY HEAD I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW IF THAT COULD WORK BECAUSE WHEN THINGS GO THROUGH THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THEY'RE USUALLY POP AND EAT. AND IF I GO THROUGH THE TEDIOUS IT ISN'T SO THAT THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A CHALLENGE AND I THINK THERE IS WAYS THAT THINGS CAN WORK OUT BETWEEN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHERE. REGIONAL CENTERS CAN CONTRACT WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND VICE VERSA BUT I. THINK AT THE STATE LEVEL THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE IS THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GO DIRECTLY TO SCHOOL TO ENABLE YEA. THAT'S SHOWING A NINETY EIGHT USE- AS OPPOSED TO NINE NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND SO THAT THAT THAT MAKES WILL COMPLICATED SO- BUT I DEFERRED TO. EITHER FINANCE OR- MY TEAM ON ON WEBEX AND THEY HAVE MORE DETAILS ON THAT OKAY. HEY JUST IF WE CAN WORK OFFLINE ON THAT MISTER CHAIR JUST TO MAKE SURE BECAUSE I THINK BECAUSE THINGS ARE SO SILOS THE THERE IS. A GROUP OF WHAT WE CALL TRAINERS THAT MAY BE CAUGHT UP IN THE- IN THE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES AND SO I'M JUST I'M JUST. A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AND THANK YOU. I ANDREW MARC. WITH A BY COMMITTEE COME. MAYBE THE CALL HI ENTER ENTER MARGOLIS- WITH THAT BUDGET COMMITTEE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRAZIER I THINK I'M PART OF THE CONFUSION HERE IS- WHAT THE VARIOUS DIFFERENT PROPOSALS ARE THERE A LOT OF DIFFERENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH RELATED PROPOSALS IN THIS IN THIS BUDGET- ONE OF WHAT THE FIRST ONE THAT YOU MENTIONED- HAS TO DO THIS IS PART OF KATHLEEN- WITH THE KAISER- CARVED OUT OF SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR SOLANO AND SACRAMENTO COUNTIES. AND THAT- AND THAT CARVE OUT IS THE ENDING IS CARD OF- COUNTY BUT IT WAS DELAYED- AS YOU I THINK MENTIONED TO BE PHASED IN- THAT WITH THE REST OF THE THAT SO IT'S SO IT'S DELAYED UNTIL THE OTHER AT BEAVER HEALTH REFORMS THAT ARE PART OF COUNTY BAR IN PLACE- SO THAT IT CAN BE A SMOOTHER TRANSITION AND CONTINUITY CARE- PROVISIONS CAN BE IN PLACE. SO THAT'S THAT PART OF IT- IN TURN OF THE AYE I AM T. I THERE'S ALSO SOME KIND. AROUND THE FACT THAT THE BUDGET INCLUDED PROPOSALS TO SHIFT B. B. I. S. T. POPULATION TO COUNTIES AND THEN A SECOND PROPOSAL TO SHIFT THE LPS COPULATIONS COUNTY. NEITHER OF THOSE PROPOSALS ARE MOVING FORWARD IN THIS BUDGET- BECAUSE OF THE CONCERNS OF COUNTIES AND FOR OTHER REASONS- AND INSTEAD IS THE BEST THING FUNDS FOR. THE DEVELOPMENT OF CAPACITY AT THE COUNTY LEVEL IN ORDER TO START SHIFTING SOME POPULATIONS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE TO THE COUNTIES IN ORDER TO CREATE MORE CAPACITY IN THE STATE HOSPITAL TO TREAT THE AYE IF HE POPULATION- AND THEN FINALLY IN TERMS. OF THE SCHOOL SERVICES THE GOVERNOR'S CHIU AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE- IT IT. IT I WOULD SAY PRIMARY PURPOSE IS TO CREATE A SYSTEM THAT IS. THAT SERVES ALL KIDS REGARDLESS OF PAYOR SOURCE REGARDLESS OF. THAT YOU KNOW CONDITION MEDICAL CONDITION OR MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION- AND SO I DON'T THINK THERE'S I DON'T THINK IT'S THE IT'S GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN A WAY THAT FILE LOAD IN TERMS OF KIDS YOU KNOW ID TEACH KIDS OR REGIONAL CENTER KIDS. I THINK THE INTENT IS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO ALL KIDS IN A VERY BAD SERVICE EVEN. EQUALLY ACCEPTABLE WAY. MERKEL THANK YOU FOR THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT BREAK DOWN. AND SOME. OF THE PUBLIC. OKAY THANK YOU FOR. THAT SORT OF EXCUSE ME SO MISSILE BITERS IN THE MISTER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'M SO MUCH TO KIND OF GET BACK WE WENT TO THIS SEEK WHAT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. THE SEQUEL EXEMPTION FOR BROADBAND I'M INDIAN MINISTER THE REFINEMENTS FINANCE LET ME KNOW IF THERE WAS ANY CONSIDERATION BECAUSE THIS SECTION I BE MISTAKEN BUT SECTION SIX OF SB ONE FIFTY SIX IS EXTREMELY AMBIGUOUS ON WHETHER OR NOT THE SEQUENCE ACTION WOULD APPLY TO THE LAST MILE. HAS THERE BEEN GIVEN ANY CONSIDERATION OF ALLOWING YOU TO LAST MILE PROJECTS TO USE EXISTING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORTS YOU KNOW MAYBE THREE TO FIVE YEARS AS AN EFFORT TO GET MORE SERVICES MORE QUICKLY- TO TWO INDIVIDUALS SO CRYPTO CHRISTIAN GRIFFITH AFTER THAT QUESTION EARLIER BUT I WILL HAVE HIM REPEAT TAX STATE I'M SIDE QUEST FACT THAT THE SEQUEL EXEMPTION ON THE BROADBAND BILL EXPLAIN. EXACTLY HOW IT CAN BE USED ON THE LAST MILE RIGHT TO IT IT'S BASICALLY FOR RIGHT OF WAYS AND SO IF THE RIGHT OF WAY IT IT IT'S REALLY JUST TOO IT'S A VERY NARROW AROUND RIGHT AWAY ISN'T IT IT'S OPEN TO THE MIDDLE MILE OR NONPROFITS FOR REGULAR PROVIDERS WHO ARE DOING A LAN CABLE ALONG RIGHT AWAY RIGHT SO I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT SO FOR OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES THAT LAST MILE IS WHERE THERE IS NO CONNECTIVITY RIGHT SO IF YOU'RE LIVING IN A RURAL AREA IN ALL GOOD WILL SAY. AND YOU ARE TWO AND A HALF MILES AND YOU KNOW PUTTING UP TO THE NATIONAL FOREST- THAT FINAL MILE GETTING ACCESS TO THAT RESIDENT CONSTITUENT IS THE MOST COMPLICATED HAVING TO DEAL WITH THE QUOTE SO WHY NOT GIVE CONSIDERATION TO ANY EXISTING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORTS THAT COULD HELP EXPEDITE THAT PROCESS WILL ONLY SPECIFICALLY. AROUND THAT LAST MILE. IS I THINK I MAY WHAT I'LL DO SAVE FROM MY UNDERSTANDING IN TERMS OF THIS PARTICULAR BILL THERE'S A LOT OF THIS DIDN'T QUITE FIX EVERY PROBLEM WE'RE GONNA HAVE AN BROADBAND IN EVERY POSSIBLE SITUATION SO THIS IS TRYING TO GET A FRAMEWORK TOGETHER GIVEN THAT THE SIX BILLION DOLLAR PACKAGE BUT I DEFINITELY THINK THE MORE TO CONVERSATION HAS TO IS GOING TO HAPPEN AND OBVIOUSLY MORE OVERSIGHT BECAUSE AND THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO TAKE YEARS TO FULLY BOOK FILLED OUT. YOU KNOW IT'S ANTICIPATED THIS COULD TAKE THREE YEARS SO I THINK THIS IS THAT THAT'S A GOOD POINT TO BRING UP TO THE CONVERSATION BECAUSE I DO THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE SUBSEQUENT LEGISLATION ON THIS GOING FORWARD EXCELLENT AND THAT'S JUST MY POINT IS THAT WE'VE SEEN THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC YOU KNOW OUR ROLE COMMUNITIES AND WHAT PLACES WERE THERE ISN'T CONNECTIVE ITTY- THAT IT WAS A DETRIMENT TO THEM THIS PAST YEAR SO ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO EXPEDITE THAT IN A SAFE MANNER- I THINK WE SHOULD MAKE PRIORITY. MY NEXT QUESTION IS I'M I'M REALLY HAPPY TO SEE THAT THE NEW CHILD CARE SLOTS- AND RATE INCREASES THAT ME AND MY COLLEAGUES ON SUB TO HAVE FOUGHT FOR SO HARD FOUGHT HARD FOR WERE INCLUDED I'M BUT I AM A LITTLE CONCERNED THAT YOU KNOW WHEN I TALK TO PROVIDERS SO WHEN I TALK TO YOU KNOW MY FAMILY WHO HAS A CHILD CARE CENTER- IT'S. REALLY HARD TO HIRE. EARLY LEARN FOR. RIGHT NOW. SO WHY DID THE ADMINISTRATION REMOVE THE FUNDING TO SUPPORT AND GROW THE WORK FORCE IN THIS. THIS AND IN SB ONE THIRTY WHAT. ACTUALLY WITH A PERMANENT FINANCE AND I WILL TURN THE QUESTION OVER TO JENNIFER LOPEZ. OF COURSE GOOD AFTERNOON JENNIFER LOPEZ DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE DID NOT REMOVE THE FUNDING TIED TO THE WORK FORCE- THAT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WAS DONE AS PART OF THAT A TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET ACT. WHAT THIS HAS DONE IS IT TO PRESERVE ALL THE WORK AND THE EFFORT THAT HAS BEEN DONE ON THE WORK FORCE STATUTE IT'S MERELY LIFTING. THIS LANGUAGE FROM EDUCATION CODE AND PUT IT IN THE WELFARE AND INSTITUTIONS CODE GIVEN THAT THE PROGRAM WAS TRANSITIONED FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO SOCIAL SERVICES. SO IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT A LOT OF THE LEGISLATURE IN ON Y COLLEAGUES. ACROSS THE AISLE DO YOU BOB WANT MORE FUNDING FOR WORK FORCE BECAUSE IT'S A PRIORITY AND REALLY. YOU KNOW IF WE DON'T HAVE THE PROFESSIONALS TO SERVE. YOU KNOW. THE EVENTUALLY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILD CARE SLOTS THAN THOSE SLOTS ARE MEANINGLESS IF WE DON'T HAVE THE WORKFORCE OF THE PERSONNEL I'M SO IT GUESS THIS WILL BE A CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION AND I LOOK FORWARD TO IT- AT MY LAST QUESTION IS AROUND SB ONE SIXTY THE CANNABIS. BUDGET BELT. IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THOUSANDS OF ILLEGAL CANNABIS GROWS HOUSE RUNG UP AROUND THE DAY ARE DESERT COMMUNITIES. CRACKING DOWN ON THESE GROWS- LOCAL OFFICIALS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT HAVE FOUND INSTANCES OF FORCED LABOR A CARTEL VIOLENCE WATER THEFT AND THE DESTRUCTION OF FRAGILE DESERT HABITATS AND WILDLIFE. ARE LOCALS FEEL LESS SAFE IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THE ILLEGAL GROWERS CARRY WEAPONS REGULARLY EXCHANGED GUNFIRE AND THREATEN HIKERS AND LOCALS. AND SIGHTSEERS THEY'VE EVEN SHOWN UP TO TOWN HALLS- CARTEL MEMBERS ARMED I'M IT'S- REALLY. BADIN SCARY IN OUR COMMUNITIES IS THERE ANYTHING IN THIS BUDGET THAT WILL ADDRESS THE ILLEGAL GROWERS AND OUR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DESERT COMMUNITIES. YES ALTHOUGH THE QUESTION OVER TO- MS HARBISON. HI KIMBERLY HERBISON DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THERE IS MONEY IN THE BUDGETS- I LIKE I CAN FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON SPECIFICS BUT THERE ARE ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AT THE NEW DEPARTMENT OF CANNABIS CONTROL THERE'S ALSO MONEY FOR- FOR THE YEAR OF STATE COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS AND- WE ALSO WORK IN PARTNERSHIP LARGELY WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND IF. ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES IN THE NEW DEPARTMENT CANNABIS CONTROL WOULD LIKE TO ADD ON THAT WOULD BE. WELCOME AS WELL. YEAH I'M A WHAT ABOUT OUR ARE THEY AVAILABLE EARLY ON ON. YES- EXCELLENT. AND I'M IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO WAY AND ALSO IS THERE IF THERE'S IF YOU COULD LET ME KNOW WHAT IF THERE'S A DOLLAR AMOUNT FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHERE THIS IS REALLY THE MOST EXTREME LEVELS I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT. SURE I'M TERRIBLE SOMETHING DEPARTMENT CANNABIS CONTROL- WE DO HOW THE PEACE OFFICERS- THEY'RE LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE STATE WORKING IN DIFFERENT AREAS INCLUDING SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. A WE DON'T HAVE A SEPARATE BUDGET FOR OUR ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES IT IS ONLY FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AT THIS POINT- BUT THOSE ACTIVITIES ARE INCLUDED. IN OUR BUDGET- FORMS FOR STUDENTS AND WHAT IS YOUR TOTAL BUDGET. HEY WE DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER IN FRONT OF ME FOR TOTAL ENFORCEMENT BUDGET- BUT I THINK WE CAN CERTAINLY GET BACK TO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR ALL THE WORK YOU'VE DONE ON THE ON THE BUDGET AND I KNOW THERE'S A LOT MORE TO TELECOM- I WANT TO RETURN TO THE DISCUSSION OF AROUND TO AB ONE FORTY AND EXPRESSED SIMILAR CONCERNS- THAT TO THOSE THAT WERE EXPRESSED EARLIER BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM GLENDALE- BUT FIRST OFF I WANT TO SAY THAT- IT'S REMARKABLE THAT IN IN THIS YEAR- WERE ABLE. TO A PROVIDED ADDITIONAL FUNDING THIS IS TWO BILLION DOLLARS OVER TWO YEARS THAT'S ALL A LOT OF MONEY- AND IT NEEDS TO BE STRESSED AS FAR AS POSSIBLE AND THROUGH. ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES IN A- IN A FAIR WAY. I'M AND WHETHER THE- DIFFERENCES THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS OR FIFTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS THIS IS A LOT OF MONEY- AT A TIME WHEN BUDGETS ARE BEING STRETCHED THIN AND THIS IS A TRUE IN EVERY CITY THAT HAS A- HOMELESS POPULATION. BUDGETS ARE BEING STRETCHED THIN IN AN EFFORT TO ADDRESS THE MANY ISSUES THAT. EXISTA AMONGST THE ON HOUSED IN IN OUR EFFORTS TO TRY AND RETURN- THOSE WHO ARE ON OUR STREETS TO HOUSING- I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT WE VIEW THIS OR THE THROUGH THE LENS OF EQUITY- AND- LOS ANGELES SHOULD NOT BE SHORT CHANGED BECAUSE- OF FOR ANY REASON AT ALL- THIS SHOULD JUST BE- FLAT OUT AN EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION AND THE- FACT THAT THERE ARE OTHER. BUCKETS OF FUNDS OUT THERE- I THINKTHAT'S GREAT THAT'S ADDITIONAL MONEY THAT CAN BE SOUGHT BY ANY COMMUNITY BUT- THOSE FUNDS CAN BE SOUGHT BY ANY COMMUNITY- AND THAT SHOULD BE TRUE OF THE MAIN- A SOURCE OF FUNDING THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TO THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS. I HAVE. IT'S OUR HOPE THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT CAN BE ADDRESSED I DO UNDERSTAND THAT- THIS IS KIND OF A LEGACY FROM- A PRIOR DISTRIBUTIONS TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS- WHERE THERE WAS A CAP PLACED TO- IN TWO SUCCESSIVE YEARS. I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT- PART OF THE ISSUE IS THAT THERE WAS NO HOMELESS CAP IN- IN IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND SO WE'RE GOING BACK- AND LOOKING AT WHAT HAPPENED TO. IT WHAT THE COUNTS FOR LIKE TWO YEARS AGO- THAT SAID I THINK THERE'S A WAY TO THERE SHOULD BE A WAY TO BALANCE THIS OUT SO THAT IT IS FAIR TO EVERY A COMMUNITY AND CITY AND THE- THAT IS SAID NO LESS THE CASE WITH. LAWCENTER SHOULD BE NO LESS THE CASE WITH LOS ANGELES. BERMAN SKODA- MISTER BENNETT THE MISS REVERSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THIS CHAIR AND I DO WANT TO THANK YOU I KNOW IT'S SO ON GOING STEADY WORK IN TERMS OF STAYING AFTER THE BUDGET ARM I JUST HAVE TO VERY BRIEF COMMENTS ONE I- APPRECIATE THE INCLUSION OF- IN THE ITEM ON THE ITEM EIGHT AND RESOURCES OIL SPILL PREVENTION ADMINISTRATIVE FUND OF THE INCLUSION OF- HAVING THE FEE BE A NEARLY INCREASE CONSISTENT WITH THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX- I THINK THAT THE CONCEPT THAT IS. BENEFICIAL FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA IN TERMS OF TRYING TO COME UP WITH A BUDGET THAT IS- CAN BE A LONG TERM SUSTAINABLE AND AVOID. HAVING US HAVE THE SITUATIONS WERE FEET DOESN'T CHANGE FOR TWENTY YEARS AND THEY- THE ACTIVITY THAT IS FUNDED BY THAT FEET KEEPS INCREASING AND COST. THEM WE GET THIS HUGE PROBLEM- SO- TO THE EXTENT THAT STAFF AS THE- RECEPTIVE TO THAT AND INCLUDE CHAD AND AS MANY FEES AS POSSIBLE I THINK CERTAINLY THINK IT'S BENEFICIAL FOR CALIFORNIA. OF HI ALSO- VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE- THEY WILL WORK ON- THE DROUGHT- CONTRACT RELIEF PROGRAM AND- UNDER THAT I WOULD JUST LIKE TO OFFER- THAT A DROUGHT BY DEFINITION IS SOMETHING THAT IS TEMPORARY AND IS EXPECTED TO GO AWAY. IT IS ATION IS SOMETHING THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE STATUS QUO AND I THINK HAT WE HAVE TO AT LEAST BEGIN THE PROCESS OF CONSIDERING- WHETHER- SIGNIFICANT PARTS OF CALIFORNIA MAY BE PARTICIPATING IN ARABIZATION RATHER THAN A DROUGHT SO AS WE MAKE THESE REFERENCES TO DROUGHT- THE- WE MAY HAVE TO BE TAKING LONGER TERM THAN JUST. THIS IS A TEMPORARY THING- BUT RATHER WE NEED T START MAKING ADJUSTMENTS FOR A JUST A DIFFERENT AVERAGE RAINFALL THAN WE'VE HAD IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISS RIVAS. THANK YOU-MISTER CHAIR- I WANNA ALIGNED MY CONCERNS WITH THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE L. A. COUNTY DELEGATION THAT I'VE ALREADY- DISCUSSED THE HOMELESSNESS FUNDING CAP- IN AB ONE FORTY FIVE YOU KNOW THE THERE'S A CAP- OF IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT WILL GO TO THE LOS ANGELES REGION. YOU KNOW AS A RESULT THE CITY OF LA IS CALCULATING A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR REDUCTION- IN THE AMOUNT OF GRANTS THAT IT WOULD RECEIVE- I KNOW THE BUDGET COMMITTEE HAS STAFF HAS ALREADY MENTIONED THAT THE CALCULATION THAT THEY ARE OF COMING UP WITH IS THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS AND- YEAH I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THAT DIFFERENCE AND I KNEW IT. AND I WANT TO SEE THE CHARTS THAT WERE THAT I KNOW WITH MY COLLEAGUES FROM GLENDALE REQUESTED TORE HER OFFICE I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SEE THAT- TO UNDERSTAND- THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THOSE TWO CALCULATIONS- IT'S VERY IMPORTANT LOS ANGELES IS THE EPICENTER OF HOMELESSNESS IN OUR STATE OF AND YOU KNOW I THINK WERE ALL THOSE OF US IN THE DELEGATION ARE VERY CONCERNED ON THE REDUCTION IN FUNDING. YOU KNOW THE CITY OF LA IS SUGGESTING THAT THEIR NUMBERS ARE RIGHT- BASED ON THE LAST POINT ACCOUNT POINT IN TIME COUNT ON HOMELESSNESS AND JUST NO MATTER HOW MUCH THE REDUCTION IS WHY SHOULD WE HAVE A REDUCTION. YOU KNOW THERE ARE OVER SIXTY THOUSAND HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS YOU KNOW THE MAJORITY OF HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS- IN OUR STATE RESIDE IN OUR COUNTY AND OUR CITY HI AND SO- JUST WANT TO ADD ON TO THAT- AND- AS YOU KNOW AS CHAIR OF NATURAL RESOURCES I HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE SEQUEL EXEMPTIONS THAT ARE- IN SEVERAL OF THESE TRAILER BELLS- YOU KNOW SEEK WHAT IS ONE OF THE FEW LEGAL TOOLS THAT ALLOW THE PUBLIC. TO MEET BOTH THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH NEEDS PARTICULARLY FOR LOW INCOME RESIDENTS AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. I UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT THESE TRAILER BELLS ARE SEEKING TO ADDRESS HOWEVER WE SHOULD NOT BE SACRIFICING CRITICALLY IMPORTANT OVERSIGHT TOOLS LIKE SEEK WHILE IN ORDER TO ADVANCE THESE PROPOSALS. THESE TYPES OF DECISIONS SHOULD GO THROUGH POLICY COMMITTEE SO WE CAN EVALUATE THE IMPLICATIONS ALLOW THE PUBLIC TO COMMENT OF N. YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND THAT THESE BILLS WERE NEGOTIATED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. I JUST WANT EXPRESSED MY FRUSTRATION THESE BILLS WILL AVOID THE POLICY COMMITTEE PROCESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU- FIRST THIS IS THE- FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I'VE BEEN ACCUSED OF BEING BAD AT MATH- I ALSO WILL SAY THIS AS THE PERSON WHO CHAMPION TOUGH FLEXIBLE FUNDING FOR CITIES COUNTIES.
