THE STATE'S COMMITMENT TO PROVIDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR MIGRATORY AGRICULTURE WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES THROUGH THE OFFICE OF MY GOT SERVICES PROGRAM BENEFITS NOT ONLY SENATE RESIDENTS BUT ALSO THE STATE'S ECONOMY AS A WHOLE. MANY OF CALIFORNIA SPECIAL CROPS REMAIN LABOR INTENSIVE DURING PEAK HARVESTING PERIODS WHICH CREATES A GREATER PRESSURE FOR LOCAL HOUSING AND ALL AGRICULTURAL AREAS IN CALIFORNIA. THIS HOUSING DEMAND USUALLY FAR EXCEEDS THE EXISTING RULE HOUSING SUPPLY THIS FARMWORKERS IN THE FAMILIES ARE REQUIRED TO FIND ALTERNATIVE. LESS DESIRABLE MEANS OF TEMPORARY HOUSING WHILE WORKING IN THE AREA. THIS THESE ALTERNATIVES OFF THE RESULT AND CENTER IN AND SEE HOUSING CONDITIONS FOR WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. PROVIDING SAFE HEALTHY AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR MIGRANT FARM WORKERS BENEFITS NOT ONLY WORKERS THEMSELVES BUT ALSO THE FARMERS AND THE CALIFORNIA POPULATION AT LARGE.

WHICH COUNTIES ARE THESE DISPERSED THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THESE. PARTICULAR CENTERS THAT REQUIRE THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE YOU KNOW WHAT COUNTIES. THEY ARE THERE THERE'S TWENTY FOUR CENTERS SO THEY ALL REQUIRE SOME DEFERRED OR JUST SOME ARE GOING TO GET THE DEFERRED. US IN THIS CASE THAT'S NOT MUCH MONEY FOR THAT MANY. WE DID IT WE DID A NEEDS ANALYSIS OF THE VARIOUS REPAIRS. THIS THE TOTAL IS ABOUT NINE MILLION FOR THESE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE THE WATER AND SEWER INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THAT THEY REALLY NEED TO GO VERY SOON. SO -- WE ARE PRIORITIZING THOSE AND THIS THE APPROPRIATION THAT WE ARE SEEKING WILL TAKE CARE THOSE OF THREE DIFFERENT CENTERS. AND THEY'RE ALL OVER CALIFORNIA AND I TRUST WHEN HE FOR SENATOR THROUGHOUT CAL NO NO BUT THAT THE ONES THAT ARE PRIORITIZE TO THE MOST NEEDY AND THEIR AND DIFFERENT COUNTIES RIGHT AROUND ONE COUNTY [inaudible] JOINING -- WELL I WILL LOOK AT THAT WE WILL JUST GET BACK.

IN THE CENTERS. WE HAVE SOME FUNDING AVAILABLE FROM PROPOSITION ONE SEE THE LAST HOUSING BOND NOT A LOT LEFT THAT WE WILL. BE ABLE TO TAP A LITTLE BIT OF THAT -- GOING FORWARD -- WE WILL LOOK AT OTHER OPTIONS THE MAYBE THAT IN THE FUTURE YOUR WOULD COME BACK FOR A GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION -- UNDER SB TO THE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING 10% OF IT HAS TO BE SPENT FOR FARMWORKERS HOUSING SO THAT MIGHT BE ONE OPTION WE COULD USE AS WELL -- AND THEN THERE THERE ARE SOME ABILITY TO TO SMALLER REPAIRS WITH THE YOU KNOW WITH THE ON GOING -- YEAH. RENTAL INCOME THE COMES INTO THAT'S VERY LIMITED BECAUSE OF RENTS ARE EXTREMELY LOW BUT DO WE WILL WE WILL LOOK FOR OTHER OPTIONS GOING FORWARD FROM. ONE OF THOSE TWO OR THREE SOURCES -- AND I JUST A QUESTION I KNOW THESE ARE -- STATE -- HOUSING CENTERS. ARE THESE THESE ARE STATE RUN IT'S IT'S A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE COUNTIES ARE OFTEN LIKE THE HOUSING AUTHORITIES SO -- SORT OF THE STATE I THINK OWN THE IMPROVEMENTS OFTEN THE COUNTY ON THE LAND THE STATE OWNS THE IMPROVEMENTS AND THEN. THE THESE CENTERS ARE OPERATED BY THE COUNTIES AND WE PRIDE THERE'S A GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION TO PROVIDE SOME OPERATING SUPPORT EACH YEAR. OKAY SO I JUST ONE ASSET -- JUST TO MAKE CLEAR THESE ARE NOT WHAT -- GROWERS ARE AGRICULTURAL EMPLOYERS PROVIDE AS FAR AS HOUSING NO YEAH THESE ARE PUBLIC THESE ARE PUBLICLY FUNDED AND PUBLICLY OWNED AND OPERATED MIGRANT CENTERS OKAY AS ONE MAKE SURE BECAUSE THE RESPONSIBILITIES AGRICULTURAL EMPLOYERS HAVE ESPECIALLY WITH GUEST WORKERS. SHOULD NOT IS NOT MIXED IN HERE RIGHT AT MINOR RIGHT AT HOUSING AND I UNDERSTAND AND THE THE THE VISA ISSUES THAT THE EMPLOYER HAS TO PROVIDE THE HOUSING RIGHT. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR FUNDING WAS AN OVERLAPPING WITH THAT THAT IS MY UNDERSTANDING OKAY -- I pTHERE'S WATSONVILLE AND DIXON ARE TO THE CENTERS THERE WOULD BE GETTING THOSE REPAIRS -- IT MIGHT BE JUST THOSE BE THAT -- THERE ARE TWO ISSUES AT THE DIXON CENTER LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER TO THEIR TO CENTERS INDEX AND THERE'S THE RAM INMIGRANTES CENTER AND THE DAVIS MIGRANTS CENTER -- OR AT LEAST INYO COUNTY SO. OKAY -- CAN WE HAVE A MOTION. I'M SORRY I DO ALSO CARRY YES OKAY [inaudible] BROKEN. YOU'RE ALSO YES NIELSEN. NUMBER YES GREAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT NOW WE CAN LEARN. GO BACK TO THE ORDER. UNDER -- ISSUE EIGHT THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH. MORNING. MORNING GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS KAREN BAKER AND I'M THE CHIEF SERVICE OFFICER OF CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR. MORGAN W. DIRECTOR GOVERNOR'S OFFICE PLAN RESEARCH THANKS REVENUE. I'M I'LL JUST GO AHEAD AND BEGIN -- BY SEEING HIM ALSO JOINED HERE TODAY -- BITE SHEILA BOXLEY. WHO IS THE? THESE PREVENTION CENTER AND ONE OF CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS FIFTY TWO GRANTEES. AND THEN THE MOMENT SHE'S ABLE TO CERTAINLY SHARE HER FIRST HAND INSIGHTS. ON WHAT IT MEANS TO UTILIZE THE AMERICORPS RESOURCES WHILE ADDRESSING A COMMUNITY NEED BUT BEFORE THAT I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU KIND OF A GLIMPSE INTO AMERICORPS CALIFORNIA -- AMERICORPS FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO MAY NOT IT IS OR WHAT WHO WE ARE IS OFTEN REFERRED TO AS THE DOMESTIC PEACE CORPS -- INDIVIDUALS OF OF ALL AGES BUT USUALLY BETWEEN THE AGES OF EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE ARE PLACED IN NON PROFITS AND PUBLIC AGENCIES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. AND AS AMERICORPS MEMBERS THEY'RE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY SERVE THEIR COUNTRY. IN EITHER A FULL TIME OR PART TIME CAPACITY IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE OVER FIVE THOUSAND AMERICORPS MEMBERS THEY'RE ABLE TO PLAY A REALLY MEANINGFUL ROLE IN ADDRESSING A WIDE RANGE OF COMMUNITY NEEDS. WHETHER IT'S THE OVER ONE HUNDRED AMERICORPS MEMBERS WHO SERVED IN PARADISE DURING THE RECENT FIRES SOME OF WHOM ARE STILL THERE. OR CITY OR MEMBERS IN BOYLE HEIGHTS WHO SHOW UP EVERY DAY TO SUPPORT YOUNG PEOPLE IN ORDER TO CLOSE THE ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT GAP OR AMERICORPS MEMBERS SERVING IN ORANGE COUNTY. WHO SERVE IN A CLUSTER OF FAMILY RESOURCE CENTERS PROVIDING FAMILY AND COMMUNITY STRENGTHENING ACTIVITIES? WE HAVE AMERICORPS MEMBERS PROVIDING SERVICES FOR VETERANS THE HOMELESS FOR FOSTER YOU. AS WELL AS MEMBERS ENGAGED IN ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP EFFORTS AND HELPING LOW INCOME FAMILIES NAVIGATE THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS EFFECTIVELY OVERSEAS OVER FORTY MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDS ANNUALLY. AND WHILE WE ARE INSPIRED BY THIS WORK THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE. WE CAN'T HELP BUT BE FRUSTRATED BY THE FACT THAT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES. THAT IS WHY WE STAND READY. TO PROVIDE DESPERATELY NEEDED RE THANK NOT BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS THESE GRANTS IN THE PAST SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY LACK THE MATCH FUNDING NEEDED TO SECURE AN AMERICORPS GRANT. WITH THE PROPOSED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDS OUR INTENTION IS TO INVEST TEN MILLION OF THESE FUNDS INTO CREATING STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS WITH NON PROFITS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. WHO ARE YEARNING TO HAVE AMERICORPS MEMBERS? WE SEE THIS AS THE FIRST STEP. TO EXPAND AMERICORPS TO A TOTAL OF TEN THOUSAND AMERICORPS MEMBERS STATEWIDE. THE SECOND TEN MILLION WILL BE USED TO AUGMENT THE CURRENT EDUCATION AWARD. THAT FULL TIME MEMBERS RECEIVE. THE THEY CURRENTLY RECEIVE SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE LIKE TO TAKE THAT TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER MEMBER. THE AVERAGE CALIFORNIA STUDENT DEBT I THIRTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PERSON. AND WE PROPOSE THAT ONE WAY TO PAY DOWN OUR PROPORTION OF THIS DAD IS TO ASSIST THOSE WHO ARE WILLING TO GIVE A YEAR OF THEIR LIFE. IN SERVICE TO HIGH NEED CALIFORNIANS. WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IS THAT AMERICORPS MEMBERS THE TAKE THEIR EXPERIENCE AND BECOME A PART OF THE NONPROFIT AND PUBLIC SECTOR? WORKFORCE AND IN THE OR GO INTO THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND DEVOTE THEIR TIME TO VOLUNTEERING IN A REALLY ROBUST WAY. IN THE END AMERICORPS MEETS COMMUNITY NEEDS BY ADDING CAPACITY TO THE ORGANIZATIONS WHO ARE ON THE GROUND. DOING THE HARD WORK DAY IN AND DAY OUT. IT CREATES A MODE OF WORK FORCED PERSON AND IT ACTUALLY SAVES TAXPAYER DOLLARS I PROVIDING EFFICIENT SOLUTIONS TO SOME OF OUR MOST CHALLENGING PUBLIC NEEDS. BUT ABOVE ALL AMERICORPS UNITES CALIFORNIANS IN SERVICE. AS MANY VETERANS WILL TELL YOU. ALTHOUGH THE SERVICEMAN OR WOMAN STANDING NEXT YOU MAY LOOK DIFFERENT FROM YOU OR COME FROM A DIFFERENT BACKGROUND. SERVING TOGETHER CONNECTION IN A FUNDAMENTAL WAY. AND ENDED IN IN A DAY AND AGE WHERE OUR SOCIETY IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE FRACTURED WE ARE CALLED T INVEST IN OPPORTUNITIES THE BRING CALIFORNIANS TOGETHER THE MAKES A STRONGER AND THAT UNITE US. AGAIN ABOUT HOW THE CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS I JUST REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU SENATORS FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BEFORE WE WILL BONTA -- QUESTIONS -- FINANCE AND LA -- NOW COMES. THANK YOU SENATOR BRIAN YOU ARE WITH THE LA -- OF WHAT WE THINK THE PROPOSAL GENERALLY IS WORTHY OF CONSIDERATION FROM THE SUBCOMMITTEE WE THINK THAT THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER SOME MODIFICATIONS TO THE STRUCTURE OF THE PROPOSAL IN LIGHT OF THE FACT. THAT IT IS BEEN PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION TO BE THE FIRST STEP IN A GREATER EXPANSION OF THE CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS. PROGRAM IN PARTICULAR -- AS WAS MENTIONED -- THAT THERE'S A NG FUND REQUIREMENT FOR THESE FUNDS AS COMPARED TO THE EXISTING PROGRAM THE MATCHING FUNDS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE PUT FORWARD BY THESE. NEW GRANTEES WOULD BE LOWER THAN HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN TRUE WITH THIS PROGRAM IN WALL THERE MAY BE ARGUMENTS -- THAT THAT COULD BE NECESSARY IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE A GRANTEES TO FORM PROGRAMS AND AREAS WHERE THEY DIDN'T EXIST BEFORE. IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THIS -- IS BEING VIEWED AS A FIRST STEP TOWARDS GREATER EXPANSION OF THIS MIGHT BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE TO TEST OUT. WHAT KIND OF MODELS COULD WORK FOR GREATER EXPANSION IN IN PARTICULAR TESTING OUT WHETHER IF WE STICK WITH THE EXISTING MATCHING? WOULD THERE BE WITH THEIR STILL BE ENOUGH DEMAND AMONG GRANTEES TO FORM NEW PROGRAMS IN A FOR THAT WERE THE CASE. THEN THE STATE'S DOLLARS TOWARDS A GREATER EXPANSION WOULD GO FURTHER -- IN COULD CREATE MORE SLOTS IN THE FUTURE. IF -- THE MATCHING FUNDS WERE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER ON THE LOCAL LEVEL SO IT'S SOMETHING TO CONSIDER MOVING FORWARD. COULD YOU RESPOND TO THAT SURE. SO I'VE BEEN IN THIS POSITION FOR TWELVE YEARS. WE HAVE CONSISTENTLY HAD PRIORITY POINTS GIVEN TO THOSE COUNTIES THOSE YOU OFTEN TEND COUNTIES. THAT ARE UNABLE TO PUT FORWARD A GRANT THAT EVER GETS FUNDED. AND THE REASON THEY DON'T GET FUNDED IT BECAUSE IS BECAUSE SIMPLY THERE ARE NOT MATCH DOLLARS AVAILABLE IN THEIR COMMUNITY. SO I'VE GOT. LIKE LIVING EXPERIENCE OF THIS. AND SO SO I WOULD ARGUE TO REALLY TACKLE THIS IS TO RECOGNIZE. AS WE HAVE THAT IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES YOU NEED TO KICK START THIS YOU NEED TO BOTH DEVELOP THAT OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY OF NONPROFITS AND SAY WE'RE GOING TO AUGMENT THIS A BIT. OKAY TO ENSURE THAT YOU CAN GET THIS STARTED AND REALLY ADDRESS CRITICAL NEEDS IN YOUR COMMUNITY OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES ARE CENTRAL VALLEY NEEDS THESE KINDS OF RESOURCES. YOU'VE GOT HIGHER POVERTY RATES YOU'VE GOT JUST REALLY ENTRENCHED ISSUES AND NOT ENOUGHSTRONG NON PROFITS THEY CAN WRITE COMPETITIVE AMERICORPS GRANTS TO SECURE THE FUNDS THEY NEED. THAT'S THE PROBLEM WE'RE TRYING TO KIND OF SOLVE FOR ANNA ALSO COMMENT THAT WE HAVE RUN THIS BY ISSUE A BOX WE CAN ATTEST. BY THE GROUP OF CURRENT GRANT TEASE TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND. OUR STRATEGY FOR THIS AND THEY ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS EVEN THOUGH THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS ADDITIONAL FUNDS BEING GIVEN. TO THIS DESERT OF SERVICE IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR STATE THAT DESPERATELY NEEDS THESE KINDS OF RESOURCES. AND WE NEED PEOPLE WITH IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY TO SERVE THEIR FELLOW COMMUNITY MEMBERS YES. DIRECTOR IDEA CERTAINLY HAVE A SYMPATHY BECAUSE I AM ORIGINALLY FROM IN FRONT FORMED THE CENTRAL VALLEY RIGHT BUT I MUST ADMIT. THERE ARE OTHER VALLEY'S. THAT SHOULD HAVE EQUAL STANDING THAT HAVE EQUAL PROBLEMS COACHELLA SACRAMENTO HAS KICKED TO THE NORTH SACRAMENTO ABOUT. AND DID. SOME CONCERN TO ME THAT YOUR FOCUS SO MUCH JUST ON THE QUOTE CENTRAL VALLEY. WHAT ABOUT OTHER AREAS I KNOW I APPRECIATE THE PEOPLE BEING UP IN PARADISE YEAH HUNDRED OF THEM DEVASTATED AREA HONOR THAT'S PARADISE ON SENATOR OF COURSE GOT FOLKS UP THERE BUT? I HATE TO SEE OTHERS EXCLUDED. AND THAT IS COMMON IN EQUITY BECAUSE SOME OF THE COUNTIES ALREADY. AS TO THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE THE THE HIGHER COST YEAR THAN THOSE WHO ARE COMING IN I THEY DON'T MIND THAT. WHAT DO YOU KNOW THAT FOR EXAMPLE IN BUTTE COUNTY -- IT HAS POINT 6% OF THE STATE'S POPULATION BUT POINT 2% OF OUR AMERICORPS. RESOURCE SAID THEY ARE ACTUALLY. THEY HAVE A HIGHER THAN POPULATION PERCENTAGE OF AMERICORPS SLOTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE I'M NOT SAYING THAT THEY WOULDN'T BENEFIT FROM. THE EXPANSION OF THIS PROGRAM THE PARADISE FOLKS ARE NOT GOING TO PERMIT NO NO NO NO I'M I'M JUST LETTING YOU KNOW AS A COUNTY THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SERVE. AND AND THERE ARE THERE ARE SO MANY NEEDY COUNTIES FOR THIS RESOURCE. I DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOU SIR WE WE COULD AND SHOULD EXPAND THIS TO ALL HIGH NEED COUNTIES YOU KNOW HOWEVER WE WOULD WANTED TO FIND THIS. I THINK THIS WAS AN EFFORT ON THE GOVERNOR'S PARTED REALLY JUST TAKE. A LOOK AT A DECADES LONG PROB PROBLEM OF A LACK OF INVESTMENT A LACK OF CAPABILITY FROM ANY NON PROFITS IN THAT COMMUNITY AND SHEILA BOX WE CAN SPEAK AS SOMEONE WHO IS. WHO'S TRIED -- TO PLACE PROGRAMS IN THAT COMMUNITY AND THESE THESE THIS-DESERT. AND HER CHALLENGES IN RAISING MATCH IT'S JUST BEEN SIGNIFICANT BUT I DON'T DISAGREE THERE'S OTHER NEEDS THAT ARE GOING ON THAT. TO YOUR POINT. BUT LET ME ASK ANALYST IS THAT. AS WE BUILD P. WEISS WE'RE CREATING FUTURE [inaudible] BUDGET OBLIGATIONS. AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO DO SO MUCH. BUT TOO MANY TIMES CALIFORNIA DOES A GO IT ALONE OR GO BEYOND THE FEDERAL AND THAT DOESN'T THAT IMPACT OUR BUDGET TO SOME. SIGNIFICANT DEGREE ON OCCASION COULD THAT NOT BE THE CASE HERE. WE HAVE A KIND OF A CALIFORNIA LOAN PROGRAM. I'M NOT. SURE THAT THIS PROPOSED EXPANSION IS NECESSARILY CREATING KIND OF PERMANENT ANG GOING POSITIONS -- IT WOULD BE COULD KIND OF KICK STARTING THESE NEW PROGRAMS -- THAT WOULD HAVE A DEFINED TIMELINE AND AND THEN IF ADDITIONAL FUNDS WERE PROVIDED IN THE FUTURE -- THAN THEY COULD CONTINUE MOVING FORWARD BUT I THINK THIS MONEY IS FOR KIND OF A DEFINED PROGRAM WITH A DEFINED. TIME I KNOW YOU I MEAN I GUESS IT'S ANOTHER QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT -- PUTTING THIS FUNDING OUT THERE IN PARTICULAR SOME OF THE PARAMETERS AROUND THE LOCAL MATCH OTHER THINGS WHETHER OR NOT THAT CHANGES KIND OF THE PRESIDENT. MOVING FORWARD THE GRANTEES WILL EXPECT -- I THINK THAT THAT'S AN OPEN QUESTION AND ONE THAT ARE GOING TO BE. LIMITED TERM P. WISE OR PERMANENT P. WISE BECAUSE THAT'S IMPORTANT RIGHT THERE THEY'RE NOT SPECIFICALLY P. WISE ITS INVESTMENT -- TO IT IS ONE YEAR FUNDING THAT CAN BE SPENT OVER A TWO YEAR PERIOD AND PERHAPS WELL I GOT IT RIGHT HE WISE IS WHAT I CAN I KNOW I HEAR YEAH I HEAR YEAH HE NEEDS YEAH. BOB AGREES SOURCES STATE RIGHT. I WANT TO ALSO LET YOU KNOW THOUGH YOU YOU MENTIONED SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT MENTION CALIFORNIA IS NOT THE ONLY STATE DURING THIS. MINNESOTA INVEST OVER TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN THESE KINDS OF STRATEGIES THE STATE OF WASHINGTON INVEST DOLLARS SO SO IF ANYTHING WERE A LITTLE LATE TO THE GAME WERE USUALLY LEAD IN THIS AREA WHERE THE LARGEST AMERICORPS PROGRAM. IN THE NATION I WOULD ARGUE THE MOST A FACT -- IF YOU ASK ME. I THINK WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS JUST SIMPLY RECOGNIZE THAT FOR THAT THERE'S THERE'S GAPS THAT WE THINK WE NEED TO KICK START AND IT IS STARTUP MONEY AND AS THE GOVERNOR HAS ALSO PROPOSED. I WILL BE WORKING QUITE ACTIVELY WITH PRIVATE PHILANTHROPY. TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S ALSO ADDITIONAL DOLLARS RAISED BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY KEENLY INTERESTED IN THIS. THANK YOU -- FIRST OF ALL WHAT WHAT A WONDERFUL MISSION YES ISN'T IT GREAT. NUMBER TWO IS DUE TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN ENCOURAGE THE KIND OF DIVERSITY -- THAT THAT. PROVIDES BENEFITS TO BOTH THE THE PERSON TO SPENDING ALL OF US YOU KNOW LET LET US KNOW HOW WE DO IT. NUMBER THREE A QUESTION -- SO THE THE ANNUAL STIPEND SIXTEEN THOUSAND IF THIS IF IF WE APPROVE THIS BUDGET MEASURED SIXTEEN THOUSAND PER. AMERICORPS VOLUNTEER NO SO OKAY SO WHAT WHAT GETS COMPLICATED ON THE NUMBERS AND I REALLY DO APPRECIATE HOW RIDICULOUSLY COMPLICATED -- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS MADE THIS FOR US ALL. RIGHT BUT THE CHALLENGE HERE. IS THAT AN APPLICANT'S TEARS OF WHAT THEY INTEND ON PAIN. THE AM AMERICORPS MEMBER THERE IS A RANGE THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS ABLE TO PAY WHICH RANGES FROM 1-300-022-0000 AS FAR AS OUR CONTRIBUTION. TYPICALLY TO THAT STATEMENT SOME PROGRAMS DEPEND BECAUSE OF THE HOUSING REALITIES LIKE A SAN FRANCISCO JUSTICE CORPS MEMBER. THEY WILL RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO PAY UP TO TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO COVER A STIPEND SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE A SHARED APARTMENT WITH THREE OTHER PEOPLE. RIGHT BECAUSE OF THAT JUST THE LIVING COSTS REALITY FOR THAT. FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL UNDER THIS PROPOSAL WERE PROPOSING TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER MEMBER. UNDER FOR TO BE PROVIDED AS STIPEND. AND RECOGNIZING FOR AN ANNUAL YES THE YES MA'AM FOR A FULL FULL TIME MEMBER. SO WHAT WHAT'S THE RANGING CALIFORNIA. SO YOU HAVE SOME PROGRAMS THAT FOR THAT ARE ONLY REQUESTING. THIRTEEN THOUSAND AND THOSE ARE USUALLY IN MARKETS WHERE YOU HAVE LET'S SAY A SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT IS PROVIDING MATCH. THAT HAS A PRIVATE CORPORATIONS THAT PROVIDE A LOT OF MATCH SO IN SOME PROGRAMS YOU HAVE ONLY ONE THIRD OF THE PROGRAM COSTS. COMING THE JUSTICES SO GIVE ME THE LOWEST AND GIVE ME THE HIGHEST LOS IS THIRTEEN THE HIGHEST IS. TWENTY OKAY YEAH IN AND WHAT WE TEND TO SEE IS THAT HIGHER NUMBER IS NEEDED IN EITHER HIGH PRICED MARKETS OR IN THOSE MARKETS WHERE THERE IS NO MATCH FOR LIMITED MATCH AVAILABLE HE RIGHT SO IF THIS GETS APPROVED YEAH DOES THAT CHANGE THAT AT ALL. NO. IT'S NOT A POLICY CHANGE AT ALL. DOES THEM UP IT BEYOND NO NO NO NO NO. IS THE DEBT FORGIVENESS COLLEGE DEBT FORGIVENESS YEAH WHAT'S WHAT'S EXCITING IS DURING YOUR YEAR OF SERVICE YOUR THERE IS YOU DON'T PAY AGAINST YOUR STUDENT LOAN FOR THE YEAR OF YOUR SERVICE. AND THEN YOU'RE GIVEN THIS EDUCATION AWARD ON THE BACK END OF YOUR SERVICE. IN A SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLAR IN EDUCATION AWARD. SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS TO AUGMENT THAT WITH AN ADDITIONAL. CLOSE TO FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS SO THAT WE CAN IN ESSENCE BE PROVIDING TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A YEAR OF SERVICE THAT'S WHEN TRYING TO GET HER BACK OKAY SO S. WHATEVER THAT SPIKE WHATEVER THAT. THIRTEEN TO TWENTY THOUSAND CORRECT LOS. MAXIMUM OF TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN DEBT YES YES YES. YES. OUR THE FOR THE QUESTIONS. OKAY DID YOU WANT MISS BOXLEY I THINK SHE CAN GIVE SOME REALLY COMPELLING SUPPORT SO IF YOU HAVE A FEW MOMENTS WE CAN DO THAT BE GREAT THANK YOU SIR YES. GOOD MORNING I'M SHEILA BOXLEY I'M THE PRESIDENT AND CEO AND HAVE BEEN FOR TWENTY ONE YEARS OF THE CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION CENTER WHICH IS. A STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION REALLY FOCUSED ON CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION -- DEEP INTO COMMUNITIES AND ENGAGING COMMUNITIES. I'M WE HAVE BEEN UTILIZING AMERICORPS MEMBERS IN FAMILY RESOURCE CENTERS IN EARLY EDUCATION AND WORKING WITH FOSTER CARE IN DOING HOME VISITATION. VERY EFFECTIVELY SINCE AMERICA CORPS FIRST BEGAN SO FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT. AND WHAT I WANT YOU TO KNOW IS PARTICULARLY IN THE PREVENTION ARENA. WITH A NUMBER OF AMERICORPS MEMBERS CURRENTLY SERVING THAT IS REALLY A FOUNDATION FOR CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION AND THE STATE UNLIKE ANY OTHER STATE SO IT'S QUITE CRITICAL TO THE WORK THAT WE DO TO SUPPORT CHILDREN AND FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. I ALSO WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT IS. FOR A PREVENTION PROGRAM BE AT HOME VISITATION OR AND FAMILY RESOURCE CENTERS IT COST US ABOUT A THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR TO WORK INTENSIVELY WITH THE FAMILY 97% OF THOSE FAMILIES DO NOT EVER ENTER TRIAL WELFARE SYSTEM. A FAMILY THAT DOES INTO THAT SYSTEM AVERAGE COST OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS SO THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD INVESTMENT IN OUR FAMILIES AND OUR CHILDREN IN OUR STATE -- WE HAVE BEEN TRYING. DESPERATELY TO HAVE MORE RESOURCES INTO THE CENTRAL VALLEY THERE'S HIGH NEED IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE DATA AND SOME OF THOSE COUNTIES IN TERMS OF MY AREA OF OF PROGRAMMING. YOU'LL SEE THERE SOME SOME VERY FRIGHTENING NUMBERS IN TERMS OF THE LEVEL OF CHILD POVERTY IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE. ON IN TERMS OF THE ALLEGATIONS OF CHILD ABUSE HOWEVER WE SIMPLY DON'T HAVE PARTNERS THERE WHO HAVE THE RESOURCES TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE THE MATCH SO WE'RE NOT ADEQUATELY PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES ARE THESE ARE REALLY CORE FUNDAMENTAL SERVICES. THAT I BELIEVE ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE WHOLE PUBLIC TO TO PROVIDE -- I ALSO WANT YOU TO KNOW A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS ONE IS WE WE PRETTY MUCH EXCLUSIVELY RECRUIT AMERICORPS MEMBERS FROM DEEP WITHIN THE COMMUNITIES THAT WERE SERVING. SO THEY REPRESENT THE CULTURAL THE LINGUISTIC MAKE UP OF THAT COMMUNITY. AFTER THEIR TERM OF SERVICE WHICH IN OUR CASE IS USUALLY SEVERAL YEARS BECAUSE THEY CAN RE UP AND THEY CAN CONTINUE TO DO SERVICE -- THEY STAY IN THOSE COMMUNITIES THEY'VE BEEN TRAINED THEIR ONGOING ASSET AND ROLE MODEL IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. AND WE SEE THAT THEY GO ON TO BE LEADERS WE SEE THAT THEY GO ON TO TAKE THAT AND AWARD AND BECOME LICENSED CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKERS OR TEACHERS OR SOMETHING ELSE IN THE HELPING FIELD. AND SO WE'RE REALLY BUILDING AN INFRASTRUCTURE WITHIN THE COMMUNITY AND DARE I SAY WE'RE TRAINING PEOPLE TO BE READY FOR THE WORK FORCE AS WELL AND THOSE COMMUNITIES WHICH IS MUCH -- I DO WANT TO COMMENT ON THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE ON THE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PERHAPS DISPROPORTIONATE MATCH THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED TO PROJECTS. I AM THE CO CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA MIRACLE REPRESENT ALL OF THE AMERICORPS PROGRAMS IN THE STATE. AND OUR STEERING COMMITTEE MET RECENTLY I THINK ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO. LOOK AT THIS LANGUAGE AND DISCUSSED IT AND WE ARE IN TOTAL SUPPORT SO THAT IS THE EXISTING PROGRAMS. AND WHAT WHAT WE ARE ALSO VERY EXCITED ABOUT IS THE INCREASE IN THE MATCH DOLLARS IS GOING TO ALSO HELP US IN RECRUITING PEOPLE -- EFFECTIVELY AND RETAINING THEM BECAUSE THAT'S A HUGE ASSET A YES IT'S A FOUR THOUSAND DOLLAR DIFFERENCE BUT A FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS AND A FROZEN STUDENT LOAN. IS IS A BIG DEAL AND SINCE MOST OF OUR MEMBERS SERVE AT LEAST TWO YEARS WE'RE TALKING TWENTY THOUSAND SO WITH AN AVERAGE DEBT OF THIRTY THREE THOUSAND THAT'S A PRETTY BIG TRUCK TO BE ABLE TO TO ADDRESS FOR THEM. AND REALLY CHANGE THEIR PROJECTION OF THE THEIR LIFE FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS WE THINK THAT'S QUITE QUITE IMPORTANT SO WE HAVE -- ENDORSE THAT WE ARE WHOLE HEARTEDLY BEHIND IT AND WE WE THINK THAT YOU COULD DO EVEN MORE AND MORE BECAUSE THIS IS A REALLY GREAT WAY TO PROVIDE SERVICES COST EFFICIENTLY. BUT EFFECTIVELY WHILE ENGAGING THE COMMUNITIES WHO NEED THE SERVICES NOT DROPPING INTO DOING SOMETHING FOR THEM AND THEN WALKING AWAY. AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. COLLEAGUES NUMBER -- AND AND I TAKE YOUR POINT ABOUT DEVELOPING LEADERS IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITY BOTH RECRUITING AND EATING THE LEADERSHIP SORT OF POPULATION -- IN. I'M NOT SURE HOW WE DO THIS OR HOW YOU DO THIS BUT I I DO THINK THERE'S SOME VALUE OF TAKING A YOUNG PERSON FROM ORANGE COUNTY. AND HAVING THEM EXPOSED TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY -- AND I THINK THAT THERE'S SOME MUTUAL BENEFIT THERE I'M NOT SURE HOW WE HOW WE BALANCE THOSE. TWO IMPORTANT GOALS BUT JUST SOME THING TO THINK ABOUT IF I CAN JUST MENTION AND SHE CHILTON COMMENT ON THIS AS WELL. PROGRAMS ARE IN CHARGE OF THE RECRUITMENT -- OF THEIR MEMBERS SO WHAT'S -- INTERESTING IS THERE ARE SOME PROGRAMS THAT MAY CHOOSE TO FOCUS PRIMARILY ON RECRUITS FROM THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITY. AND OTHERS THAT RECRUITS STATEWIDE OR EVEN NATIONALLY SO THAT ISN'T A REQUIREMENT THAT IT COME FROM THE LOCAL COMMUNITY BUT WE OFTEN SEE THAT. ON THAT THE COUNTY THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IT OFTEN CAN ATTRACT. YOU KNOW -- OPPORTUNITIES FROM THAT LOCAL ENVIRONMENT THAT YOU CAN FIND AT NIGHTAND I TAKE YOUR POINT YEAH THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF VALUE IN THERE'S JUST THERE'S DEPENDS ON YEAH BUT I AGREE WITH THE ORANGE COUNTY IF THAT WOULD BE. WE HAVE A LARGE CLUSTER OF MEMBERS IN ORANGE COUNTY ACTUALLY WORKING WITH THE NETWORK OF FAMILY RESOURCE CENTERS DOWN THERE -- PROVIDING SERVICES AND NOT EVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT WE RECRUIT IS FROM WITHIN THAT COMMUNITY THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE WHO COME IN AND I ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO TO HAVE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE REAL NEEDS OF OTHER COMMUNITIES AND NOT. JUST PERHAPS IN THEIR OWN THEIR OWN WORLD BUT WHAT WE DO FIND IS IN TERMS OF THE TRUST PARTICULARLY VERY VULNERABLE FAMILIES. VERY OFTEN IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THAT PERSON TO KNOW THAT COMMUNITY AND UNDERSTAND IT A SIMPLE EXAMPLE IS. HI THIS IS HOW YOU CAN GO ABOUT GETTING THIS PARTICULAR SERVICE THAT YOU NEED A WE'RE GOING TO HELP YOU AND THIS IS WHERE IT IS. IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE TO TAKE TO BUST CHANGES AND YOU HAVE AN INFANT AND A TODDLER -- JUST BECAUSE THAT'S THEIR ON THE LIVE I CAN BE VERY AFFECT ALL RIGHT THAT I I I AGAIN I TAKE YOUR POINT I THINK. IT SO ALL RIGHT SIDE OF THE EQUATION THANK YOU COULD -- I THINK THIS IS ALL VERY VERY. GOOD AND POSITIVE I COMMEND YOU ON I THINK THIS IS A A GREAT PROGRAM JUST ONE MORE QUESTION TO BE. A CLEAR ON SENATOR UMBERG'S -- QUESTION ON THE COLLEGE DEBT FORGIVENESS YOU MENTIONED IT WAS OF FEDERAL EDUCATION AWARD OR IS IT FOR SENATE FEDERAL TRUST THAT PROVIDE SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS OUT OF THE CORPORATION FOR NATIONAL AND COMMUNITY SERVICE WHICH IS THE FEDERAL AGENCY. THAT OVERSEES THE TRUST THEY PROVIDE THAT TO EVERY FULL TIME AMERICORPS MEMBER THE COME. A YEAR OF SERVICE. SO THEY'RE CONSIDERED EVEN THOUGH IT'S A FEDERAL PROGRAM. AND OURS IS THE STATE AND ITS WITHIN CALIFORNIA THAT THEY ARE SELECTED. YEAH HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU THAT ALL COME TOGETHER HOW DOES IT COME TOGETHER BETWEEN THE FEDERAL AWARD. AND THE STATE SO GRANT FEDERAL RESOURCE FOR THE FOR THE AMERICORPS MEMBER OF THE STIPEND ONCE THEY'RE SELECTED. GRANT DOLLARS FLOW FROM THE FEDERAL ENTITY INTO CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS. COFFERS WE THEN HOLD A COMPETITIVE PROCESS. SEVEN SHEILA BOXLEY RECEIVES THE GRANT. SHE ENTERS IN TO EAT GROUNDS THAT THESE ARE HER MEMBERS AND ONCE THEY COMPLETE THEIR SERVICE. THAT INFORMATION GET SENT TO ARE THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE COMPLETED THEIR SERVICE SO THEY QUALIFY FOR OUR TRUST. SIX OUTSIDE YEAH YEAH I JUST WANT TO MAKE JOHN GLAD IT ALWAYS CONNECT THE DOTS RIGHT AT THE TWO YEAH RIGHT SO LIKE SOME CRACK WILL GET FOUR THOUSAND AND SOMEONE GETS SICK STYLE DOWN NOW. YOU'LL GET THE TO GET TO TOGETHER. OKAY YEAH. ALL RIGHT. ANNA. SENATE COLLEAGUES [inaudible] QUESTION. OKAY -- I THINK THAT -- FOR NOW OUR STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS TO HOLD IT OPEN SO -- BUT WE I I THINK I CAN ONLY SPEAK FOR MYSELF. I THINK THIS IS A GREAT PROGRAM AND I COMMEND YOU. I THINK ARE YOU CAN. YOU ARE YOUNGER WHOEVER VOLUNTEERS I ASSUME A LOT OF THEM ARE YOUNG. IT'S A GREAT THING TO DO IN THEIR LIFE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE SAME [inaudible] OKAY. NINE NINE OKAY ISSUE. NINE DISCOUNT NINE WHICH IS I'M SURE IS GOING TO BE THE MOST EXCITING THE PRESENTATION -- HERE TODAY ON A PROPOSAL FOR A FUNNY IN -- TO TO DEAL WITH THE FISCAL ACCOUNTING SYSTEM -- WE REQUESTING TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS -- TO ESTABLISH THREE POSITIONS -- TO ASSIST WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION SYSTEM OF CALIFORNIA KNOWN A FISH GO ON THIS IS BASED ON THE INCREASED LEVEL OF WORKING COMPLEXITY FISCAL RELATED TO TASKS. THAT HAVE INCREASED -- OVER THE LAST YEAR IN AND WILL CONTINUE TO CREASE WITH WITH THE AND TO SPEAK WITH -- OR TO SOME OF US STAFF COMMENTS -- THEY MENTIONED -- ADDITIONAL RESOURCES CLEARLY BE BENEFICIAL DEPARTMENT. OF THE PROPER LEVEL OF RESOURCES LESS CLEAR IT'S SIMILAR GRANT MAKING THE OPERATIONS. TYPICALLY HAVE LARGER ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE AND STATUS RELATIVE TO SMALLER ORE ADMINISTRATIVE. ENTITIES BECAUSE OPR HAS BOTH GRANT MAKING AND RESEARCH AND POLICY SECTIONS THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF COUNTY AND FINANCE RESOURCES UNCLEAR ABSENT ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD INFORMATION -- AND WE DON'T NECESSARILY DISAGREE WITH THAT THOSE THOSE STAFF COMMENTS -- WE DID BASED THE THREE POSITIONS ON ON THE NEEDS THAT WE'VE SEEN ON A WORK LOW LEVEL. OVER THE FIRST YEAR OF BEING IN THE FISCAL SYSTEM. AS WELL AS OUR NEED FOR SEPARATION OF DUTIES -- AND THAT'S BEEN AN ONGOING ISSUE WITH THE P. R. OVER THE YEARS VERY SMALL ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF YOU KNOW ONE FULL TIME ACCOUNTANT -- YOU KNOW ONE FULL TIME CONTRACT PERSON DEDICATED THE THE APPEAR PROGRAMS. AND SO WHEN YOU WORK INSIDE FISCAL THERE'S THERE'S A REQUIRED SEPARATION OF DUTIES -- THAT THAT IS IS MUCH MORE INVOLVED THAN THAN HAS BEEN IN THE PAST. AND SO THE THREE POSITIONS BOTH BASED ON ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD AS WELL AS THAT NEED TO TO MEET THE SEPARATION OF DUTIES REQUIREMENTS -- FROM AN ACCOUNTING STANDPOINT TRANSFERRED THE STANDPOINT IN IT AND A CHANCE. A TRANSITION TO THE NEW SYSTEM I RELATED EVERYTHING FROM THE PROCUREMENT TO THE COUNTY TO THE TO THE GRANTS IN THE INTERAGENCY AGREEMENTS WE HAVE TO ENTERTAIN ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS. OKAY. ABOUT FROM MAR FINANCE EARN ANY COMMENTS. SERVICE DEPARTMENT FINANCE I THINK AND I APPRECIATE THAT APPEARS RECOGNIZING THAT -- THE WORKLOAD IS DOES EXIST I THINK THAT THROUGHOUT THE BUDGET YOU'RE SEEN ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IN SEVERAL DEPARTMENTS FOR FIFTH COLUMN WE JUST WANT TO BE SUCCESSFUL MAKE SURE THE DEPARTMENTS ARE SUCCESSFUL. WE OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T KNOW ALL THE PIECES THE COMPONENTS WOULD TO ACTUALLY USING THE SYSTEM AND SO WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE SET UP FOR SUCCESS. THEY ALSO HAVE I'M TAKING ON A LOT OF DIFFERENT SPECIAL PROJECTS FOR THE GOVERNOR -- WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION AND JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO MEET ALL THE OBLIGATIONS THAT WE'VE GIVEN THEM [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] ALEJO'S [inaudible] COM [inaudible] OKAY. A QUICK QUESTION WITH RESPECT TO THE STATUS STABILIZATION WHAT'S THE STATUS OF STABILIZATION. IN FISCAL OF DISCUSSES HIMSELF WELL IT IS STABILIZATION AMONG THE UNITS AND SYSTEM ITSELF RIGHT. SO I MEAN WE'RE WE'RE GETTING TO THAT THAT POINT THAT'S I MEAN PART OF THE REASON FOR THESE THREE POSITIONS IS TRY TO TO TO TO GET TO THAT STABILIZE WORK -- WORKLOAD AND AGAIN TO THAT SEPARATION OF DUTIES -- YOU KNOW ONE THING ABOUT THIS GAL IS IT'S ALSO CONTINUALLY. IMPROVING IF YOU WILL A NEW MODELS COME ONLINE GUIDE NEW TRAINING. WHICH TAKES STAFF TIME AND ALSO REQUIRES KIND OF SEE. YOU KNOW A IT'S IT'S A IT'S A SYSTEM THAT THAT ISN'T. COMPLETELY FINALIZED FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM -- AND SO I YOU KNOW IT WE'RE IT WOULD THIS IS A PROPOSAL TO HELP. US STABILIZE INTERNALLY -- WE'LL SEE HOW THAT PLAYS OUT LONG TERM. WITH THE OVERALL START ANY UNITS% STABILIZED. I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH YOU ANTICIPATE ANY UNITS BEING STABILIZED IN THIS YEAR. I DIED FROM A FISCAL STANDPOINT I DON'T KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN LOOK INTO AND GET BACK TO ME. OKAY YEAH I HAVEN'T I HAVEN'T REALLY LOOKED AT THAT THE STABILIZATION OF OTHER UNITS OF OUR THAT BE GREAT AND IF IF. LATER ON THAT WHAT THE DEFINITIONS OF STABILIZATION HOW MANY UNITS ARE STABILIZED WHEN DO YOU ANTICIPATE. THE STABILIZATION SORT OF I SUPPOSE THE SEQUENCE. OKAY THANK GOD [inaudible] NIELSEN. ALL RIGHT -- WORLD ALL HOLD OPENS ON THIS -- AWAY PUBLIC COMMENT. OKAY TOO MANY PEOPLE AFTER. ALL HAVE TO CUT THE TIME DOWN. NOT ALL AT ONCE. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH CERTAINLY APPRECIATED -- RULE ON TO ISSUE. TEN SB TEN SEVENTY TWO LIMITATION CORRECT -- SO -- OF SPLINTER WEEK RESEARCH REQUEST THREE POSITIONS AND THREE AND A NINETY TO THE NINE FISCAL YEAR TO IMPLEMENT SB. TEN SEVENTY TWO WHICH REQUIRE THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNSEL TO COMPLETE THE FOLLOWING TEST DEVELOPED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GUIDELINES BUDGET BY JULY. ONE TWENTY TWENTY AND ESTABLISH A REGIONAL CLIMATE CLOUDED PROGRAM TO ASSIST UNDER RESOURCE COMMUNITIES TO ACCESS STATEWIDE PUBLIC IN OTHER GRANT MONIES -- SIMILAR CONCERNS -- RAISED BY STAFF -- YOU KNOW ALL ON WORKLOAD -- MOST NOTABLY THAT THAT THE FIRST YEAR IS IS VERY MUCH ABOUT ESTABLISHING GRANT -- GUIDELINES AND PROCESSES -- AND IN OUTLYING YEARS OR MORE ABOUT ADMINISTRATION OF THOSE GRANTS AND THERE IS DEFINITELY UNCERTAINTY IN THOSE OUTLINED YEARS -- ONE WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH FUNDING IS GOING TO BE WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY GRANT APPLICATIONS ARE MIGHT BE -- SO THAT THAT COULD BE AN ISSUE WE HAVE BASS THESE THREE POSITIONS ON OUR EXPERIENCE OF OF DEVELOPING GRANT PROGRAMS THAT APPEAR THROUGH THE STREETS GROWTH COUNCIL -- AND FEEL THAT THOSE THOSE THREE POSITIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE EXPERIENCE WE'VE HAD IN DEVELOPING PROGRAMS IN IMPLEMENTING. A PROGRAMS -- CLEAN THE OUT YEARS. THE FOCUS IS DEFINITELY IN A SHIFT FROM DEVELOPMENT OF THE GUIDELINES -- TO MORE OUR REACH TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES TO IMPLEMENT THOSE GUIDELINES -- AND AND YOU KNOW IT ADMINISTER THE GRANTS IN THOSE OUT YEARS SO THAT'S WHERE WE SEE THE KIND OF THE NEED -- DEFINITELY SHIFTING IN AND MAYBE -- BUT WE THINK FOR NOW THAT THOSE THREE POSITIONS OR WHAT WE NEED TO TO AT LEAST GET THE GRANT PROGRAM. A GUIDE LINES UP AND RUNNING IN AND GET [inaudible] GRAHAM IMPLEMENTED. OF HIS PLAN. THE ONLY THING I WOULD NOTE IS THAT OPR GIVEN THEIR AND MERRY OUT OF RESPONSIBILITIES FROM ST STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNSELOR FOR DUTY IS CAROLINE TEARS. PRECISION MEDICINE THERE ARE JUST A LOT OF THEM -- HEALTH AND ALL POLICIES AT THE JUST MANY AND AND I THINK THAT GENERALLY SPEAKING THERE ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE IS IS FAIRLY SMALL. IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO TAKE ON SOME OF THESE DUTIES SO THIS WAS WHAT WE THINK IS THE RIGHT LEVEL OF RESOURCES BUT WERE WILLING TO TAKE THIS INTO CONSIDERATION THE SOUTH COMMENTS AND JUST RETHINK THIS AND AND COME BACK WITH MORE INFORMATION. OKAY. ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ON SOME. COMMENTS [inaudible] COLLEAGUES [inaudible] SO I MAYBE YOU CAN DIG IN JUST A LITTLE BIT ON ON THE ISSUE OF THE GUIDELINES WILL BE BY NEXT YEAR.

YES OF THE IN SO THE AGAIN THAT THE FIRST YEAR WE HAVE -- DEVELOP GREAT GUIDELINES AND BY OCTOBER -- TWENTY NINETEEN AND THEN TO FELT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GUIDELINES BY JULY -- TWENTY TWENTY WERE ALSO -- REQUIRED -- TO ADVANCE PAYMENT GUIDELINES THERE'S NO DEADLINE ON THAT -- BUT WE HOPE TO INCLUDE THAT IS AND AND COINCIDE WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GRANT PROGRAM -- AGAIN ON THE OUT YEARS -- THE WORKLOAD IS IS GONNA BE CONSIDERABLY DIFFERENT IN THAT IT'S GONNA BE MUCH MORE INVOLVED IN IN. STAKEHOLDER OUT REACH -- OUT WE TO THOSE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES -- TO ONE MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND THAT THE PROCESS IN THE GUIDELINES -- IN TO SET THEM UP TO BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR FOR THE VARIETY OF GRANTS THAT THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE TIME LINE UP TO TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. THE SENSOR THAT WAS CREATED IN IN THE ORIGINAL BILL. FOR THE PROGRAM. OKAY ANYMORE QUESTIONS COLLEAGUES NO PUBLIC COMMENT. NONE HEARING NONE THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH FOR TIME -- ISSUE.

DESPITE RECENT SIGNIFICNT INVESTMENTS TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS IN THE STATE SIGNIFICANT NEED STOCKTON. A EXIST IN THIS AREA AT WELL ABOVE 60% -- CALIFORNIA HAS THE HIGHEST PROPORTION OF A SHELTERED HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AND SO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD MAKE HEADWAY IN ADDRESSING SOME OF THE I'D MET DEMANDS. SPECIFICALLY THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION TOWARD. ON THE OTHER HAND THE OTHER COMPONENT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION FOR MILESTONES IS A RISKY VENTURE IN OUR MIND IT'S UNCERTAIN HOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL RESPOND TO THAT AND SO WE URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER OTHER APPROACHES THAT WOULD HAVE. MORE CERTAIN BENEFITS TOWARDS THE HOMELESS POPULATION THANK YOU. WOULD YOU LIKE. TO RESPOND TO THEM. WE AT LEE BELIEVE THAT TAKING THIS APPROACH PROVIDES INCENTIVES FOR LOCALS TO ACTUALLY DEVELOP SHELTERS -- TO ASSIST THEIR COMMUNITIES AND WE ARE PROVIDING THAT THIS REPORT ON THE BACK AND TO INCENTIVIZE THEM TO DO SO OKAY COLLEAGUES. NO PUBLIC COMMENT. NICOLE ORNAMENT ON BEHALF OF THE SAN BERNADINO COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WE APPRECIATE AND ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR HOMELESSNESS -- WE ARE EAGER TO SEE THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND WE SUPPORT MILESTONES FLEXIBILITY AND TAKING INTO ACCOUNT REGIONS THAT HAVE SPENT A LOT OF THEIR OWN RESOURCES AND ON ALREADY REDUCING THEIR HOMELESS POPULATION AS SAN BERNADINO HOUSE [inaudible] THANK YOU.

I'M WE CERTAINLY SUPPORT ON THE IDEA OF INCENTIVES -- INCENTIVES ARE WEEDS WE SEE IS THE BEST APPROACH TO TO GET CITIES AND ANY BASICALLY ANYBODY TO DO WHAT WE WANTED TO DO ALSO. WITH AFFORD REVIEW IN THAT TRAILER BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU QUESTION FOR YOU I'M WHERE A STATEWIDE ACSI WORKING AS ASIAN REPRESENTING RUNAWAY AND HOMELESS YOUTH PROVIDERS. AND HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO REALLY REVIEW THAT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AS IT WAS LAST NIGHT. AND I WOULD ADVOCATE THAT YOU KNOW YOU'VE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ARE -- A BIG CONSIDERATION IN TERMS OF NEED I'M CALIFORNIA HAS THE SECOND HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF YOU BETTER AND SHELTERED. I'M OVER 80% AND MUST OVERSEE YOUR SEATS HAVE REALLY HIGH NUMBERS OF AND SHELTERED YOU. I'M EVEN IF THEY ARE ONLY 11% OF THE OVERALL HOMELESS POPULATION WE KNOW THAT THEY WILL EXIT INTO BEING A CHRONICALLY HOMELESS ADULT IF WE DON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THEM WHEN THEY'RE HERE. SO I'M JUST LOOKING AT WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS DONE AROUND THE HOMELESS YOUTH DEMONSTRATION PROJECT IS POTENTIALLY A WHAT A MODEL MAY BE FOR ADDRESSING YOUTH NEEDS IN TERMS OF PLANNING AND SERVICES AND SUPPORTS FOR HOW DO WE ADDRESS. WHAT WE NEED TO DO FOR YOU? AND SIR IS ONE THAT WILL CONTINUE TO WEIGH IN ON THE GOOD DEPARTMENT FINANCE AND YOUR OFFICES AROUND HOW WE CAN DO THAT BETTER THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M FAIRLY TAKE TING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES WE REPRESENT ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT. YOU KNOW THEY'RE STILL NEEDS TO BE SOME OF THE SAUSAGE MAKING THAT WE TALK ABOUT IN THESE COMMITTEES ON HOW THIS FUNDING IS -- COMES DOWN TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S COMMITMENT TO FUND HELPING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COMBAT HOMELESSNESS WE WOULD SAY THAT LAST YEAR'S HEAT MODEL WE'RE STILL HAVING SOME LESSONS LEARNED THAT MONEY IS JUST NOW GOING OUT IN CITIES AND COUNTIES AND CONTINUUM'S OF CARE -- FIGURING OUT HOW TO BEST USE THAT MONEY WE THINK WITH COUNTIES BECAUSE WE OFFER THE FULL CONTINUUM OF SERVICES NOT JUST PUBLIC SAFETY AND MAYBE CODE ENFORCEMENT BUT ALSO THE HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS -- EVEN ANIMAL SERVICES PROGRAM I MEANT TO HELP COMBAT HOMELESSNESS SO WILL BE ASKING FOR SOME OF THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION TO COME DIRECTLY TO COUNTIES -- BUT ALSO STRONGLY STRONGLY STRONGLY VALUE COLLABORATION -- BECAUSE NO CITY OR NO COUNTY CAN DO THIS BY THEMSELVES SO AGAIN WE WANT TO THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR HIS PROPOSAL WITH STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS FUNDING THANK YOU THANK YOU. MORNING MADAM CHAIR JEAN HEARST HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE URBAN COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA THE FOURTEEN LARGEST HI COUNTIES IN THE STATE. I HOMELESSNESS AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IS ONE OF THE URBAN CHINESE TOP PRIORITIES WE'RE CERTAINLY VERY SUPPORTIVE -- ADDITIONAL RESOURCES COMING LOCAL LEAD TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AND CERTAINLY ARE INTERESTED IN CONTINUING TO WORK WITH YOU THROUGH THE PROCESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU EVERYONE -- YES -- IT COULD YOU EXPLAIN MORE OF WHAT THE GENERAL PURPOSE INCENTIVE FUNDS. I MEAN. AND WHAT'S. REALLY HOW HOW DO YOU THINK THAT'S GOING TO WORK. AND HOW OLD HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU SEE THE LOCALS QUALIFYING FOR THEM. SO IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR THE REWARDS FINDING -- THAT WILL BE. DESIGNED TO THE APPLICATION PROCESS WHERE THE AGENCY WILL WORK WITH THE CONTINUES OF CARE AND THAT THE LARGE CITIES. I AM TO OUTLINE OF MILESTONES THAT THEY BELIEVE ARE ACHIEVABLE WITHIN THEIR OWN PLANS AND THEN THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL BE MEASURED AGAINST. THEIR OWN -- TARGETS AND OF COURSE AGENCY PROVIDING OVERSIGHT TO ENSURE THAT THOSE TARGETS A REASONABLE -- WITH REGARD TO THE INCENTIVE DOLLARS PURPOSE DOLLARS THAT GO OUT IF THESE TARGETS ARE MET WELL WE ENVISION AND WE WOULD HOPE THAT THEY ARE USED TO CONTINUE OUR FURTHER HOUSING GOALS. WITHIN THOSE JURISDICTIONS ARE WITHIN THOSE -- CEO SEES THEY ARE GENERAL PURPOSE AND THAT WOULD BE LEFT UP TO THE CO SEASON THE JURISDICTIONS WITH. SO HOW HOW DOES NOT DIRECTLY HELP WITH HOMELESSNESS I MEAN THE USER. DOLLARS THAT -- YOU KNOW WE'RE ALL ANXIOUS. TO DO IT DIRECTLY WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO HELP OUR HOMELESS SO HOW DO YOU SEE THAT HOW HOW DOES A GENERAL PURPOSE INCENTIVE FUND. DIRECTLY HELP WITH THE ISSUE OF OUR HOMELESSNESS WE BELIEVE THAT BUT BY CREATING THE SHELTERS AND PROGRAMS WITHIN THE COMMUNITIES IS GOING TO CREATE COSTS. ON THE JURISDICTIONS AND WE LEAVE THESE FUNDS THESE INCENTIVE FUNDS WILL HELP THAT. BUT WE DO WANT TO JURISDICTIONS TO CHOOSE THEIR PATH FORWARD WITH THE PLANNING DOLLARS AND THEREFORE CHOOSE OUR PATH FORWARD WITH THE REWARD FUNDS OKAY [inaudible] RIGHT. NO MORE QUESTIONS ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND GIVE SHADE IT [inaudible] PLEASE. ALRIGHT WE'LL MOVE ON TO ISSUE A TWELVE SHORT TERM PLANNING AND PRODUCTION GRANTS -- MAKING A FRIEND [inaudible] MORNING. I LIKE MY DEPARTMENT PLEASE. WITH SOME QUESTIONS. I'VE DANIELLE BRANDON AGAIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION IN GENERAL FUND IN TRAILER BILL LNGUAGE TO PROVIDE HOUSING PLANNING AND PRODUCTION GRANTS TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. AND WILL BE ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. FOR THE SHORT TERM GOALS H. CD WILL ESTABLISH THESE NEW TO SHORT TERM STATEWIDE HOUSING GOALS. FOR JURISDICTIONS FOR TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE THESE TARGETS WILL BE BASED ON THREE YEARS OF REINA XCELERATED INTO TWO YEARS. EIGHT CITY WILL ALLOCATE THE INCREASE TARGETS TO JURISDICTIONS ACCORDING TO SPECIFIED FACTORS INCLUDING SHARE OF JOBS AVAILABLE. THE FIRST TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TWENTY FIVE MILLION WILL BE AVAILABLE TO JURISDICTIONS AND WILL BE DISTRIBUTED BY DECEMBER. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WITH THE JURISDICTIONS COMMITMENT TO COLLABORATE WITH THE REGION. IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A REGIONAL ACTION PLAN. THE SECOND HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION WILL GO TO REGION'S WITH UP 250% OF THE FUNDS BEING DISPERSED BY DECEMBER. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TO PROVIDE UP FRONT FUNDING. TO CONDUCT REGIONAL -- PLANNING ACTIVITIES AND CONVENE JURISDICTIONS WITHIN THE REGION. THERE ARE MANY 50% WILL BE DISTRIBUTED BY DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY OFFENSIVE MIDDLE AND APPROVAL OF A REGIONAL ACTION PLAN. REGIONAL ACTION PLANS WILL IDENTIFY PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS BARRIERS TO PRODUCTION. AND OTHER ACTIVITIES NECESSARY TO INCREASE PRODUCTION. THE PLAN WILL ALSO IDENTIFY THE METHODOLOGY THAT WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE PRODUCTION REWARD AMOUNTS FOR JURISDICTIONS. IF A JURISDICTION IS IN A REGION OR COUNTY THAT IS NOT SUBMITTED A PLAN THE KIDS WITH THEIR OWN PLAN FOR EACH CD APPROVAL. EIGHT CITY WILL IDENTIFY METHODOLOGY METHODOLOGY TO DISTRIBUTE INCENTIVE AWARDS TO THESE JURISDICTIONS. FINALLY THE REGIONAL PLAN IS THE MOST CRITICAL COMPONENT. OF THIS WE WANT TO INCENT LOCALS AND REGIONS TO WORK TOGETHER TO MEET THE INCREASED PRODUCTION AND INDICATE HOW THEY INTEND TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS. REGION'S WILL DETERMINE THE METHODOLOGY TO AGREED UPON ACTIVITIES. AND I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS IF YOU HAVE ANY OKAY. THE THE ADMINISTRATION'S A PROPOSED ON THE SERVER IT INCLUDES SEVERAL PIECES SOME THAT ARE AIMED AT INCREASING HOUSING PRODUCTION IN THE SHORT TERM AND SOME. AND INCREASING -- PRODUCTION IN THE LONG TERM AS FAR AS THE SHORT TERM COMPONENTS. WE HAVE SEVERAL CONCERNS WITH THESE PROPOSALS -- THE FIRST IS THAT THE STRATEGY THAT'S PROPOSED AN ESTABLISHING THE SHORT TERM GOALS A SEEMS TO BE A CONTINUATION OF THE STATE'S EXISTING STRATEGY THAT IT'S HAD. FOR A SEVERAL YEARS THROUGH THE HOUSING ELEMENT AND REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION ARENA PROCESS. IN OTHER IT'S NOT CLEAR THIS PROPOSAL KIND OF DIFFERENTIATES ITSELF FROM THAT PASSED STRATEGY THAT -- RESEARCH BY OUR OFFICE AND ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS HAS FOUND HAS BEEN GENERALLY INEFFECTIVE IN ACHIEVING ITS GOALS. AND BECAUSE OF THAT WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON THESE SHORT TERM CHANGES A WE WE GREW THE ADMINISTRATION ALSO THAT THAT FOCUSING ON WAYS TO FURTHER IMPROVE THE EXISTING LONG TERM PLANNING STRUCTURE. A WOULD BE A BETTER USE OF THE LEGISLATURE'S EFFORT IN THIS AREA OUR OTHER CONCERN IS WITH THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION AND FUNDING SET ASIDE FOR A KIND OF INCENTIVE FUNDS TO CITIES AND COUNTIES. OF THE STATE HAS A TRIED SIMILAR APPROACHES IN THE PAST OF MAKING POTS OF FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR JURISDICTIONS TO ENCOURAGE THEM -- TO APPROVE A PLAN FOR TO PROVE HOW REVIEW OF THIS PAST PROGRAMS -- DOESN'T -- DOESN'T SUGGEST THAT THEY HAD A A SIGNIFICANT MEASURABLE IMPACT ON THOSE LOCAL APPROVALS OF HOUSING BECAUSE OF THIS. WE THINK THAT THIS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION COULD ESSENTIALLY BE A PRETTY RISKY BET FROM THE LEGISLATURE'S PERSPECTIVE -- YOU KNOW AN ALTERNATIVE USE OF THIS FUNDS FOR EXAMPLE -- ALLOCATING THE FUNDING DIRECTLY FOR SUBSIDIES FOR CONSTRUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING WOULD YIELD A MORE CERTAIN BENEFIT MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE FIVE THOUSAND ADDITIONAL FOR DOUBLE UNITS ACROSS THE STATE -- WALL WERE SKEPTICAL OF THE KIND OF THE SHORT TERM APPROACHES PRESENTED BY THE THE GOVERNOR WE DO AGREE. THAT IT WOULD BE WORTHWHILE. TO CONTINUE TO RETHINK THE LONG TERM PLANNING PROCESS SEES THE LEGISLATURE HAS TAKEN SEVERAL IMPORTANT STEPS IN THIS AREA IN RECENT YEARS. BUT WE DO THINK THAT THERE CONTINUE TO BE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENT -- AND WE DID ISSUE A REPORT ABOUT A MONTH AGO WERE WE OUTLINED A SEVERAL SUGGESTIONS THAT WE THINK WE TAKE IN THE CONSIDERATION OF FURTHER DISCUSSIONS FOR REFORMS. TO THOSE PLANNING PROCESSES AND I'D BE HAPPY TO GO INTO THOSE IF THE KID SUBCOMMITTEE. WOULD BE INTERESTED ONE TO SPEAK TO ONE PARTICULAR ELEMENT OF THE THE GOVERNOR'S LONG TERM CHANGES. ARE THE MINISTRATIONS PROPOSED -- TYING. SB ONE LOCAL STREETS AND ROADS OF FUNDING TO A PROGRESS TOWARDS. MEETING THESE KIND OF LONG TERM. PLANNING GOALS -- IN WALL -- WELL WE AGREE THAT THIS IS A THE STATE DISCRETIONARY POT THAT THE STATE ALLOCATES AT THE CITIES. AND IN THAT RESPECT IT IT IT DOES PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY FROM THE STATE'S PERSPECTIVE IN TERMS OF IF WE ARE INTERESTED IN SHIFTING THE INCENTIVES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IN THE AREA. OF HOUSING BUT AT THE SAME TIME THIS APPROACH COULD PRESENT SEVERAL DRAWBACKS. THE FIRST IS THAT -- TYING. TYING THE SB ONE ALLOCATIONS TO A PROGRESS IN THE RENO PROCESS. SENSUALLY COULD BE ESSENTIALLY HOLDING CITIES AND COUNTIES ACCOUNTABLE FOR FACTORS THAT IN SOME CASES ARE BEYOND THEIR CONTROL -- AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE IF THE SP ONE FUNDS ARE TIED TO MEETING PARTICULAR PRODUCTION -- TARGETS -- NO IN LOOKING AT THE DETAILS OF THE THE TRAILER BILL THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED IN THIS AREA IT APPEARS THAT THEY ARE ATTEMPTING TO TRY TO MITIGATE SOME OF THAT ISSUE. BY TYING THE SB ONE FUNDING MORE TO PROGRESS TOWARDS UP KIND OF PLANE ANGLES HAVING TO COMPLY HOUSING ELEMENT IN MAKING ZONING CHANGES BUT IT APPEARS AT LEAST -- IN THE TRAILER BILL HERE -- THAT THEY ARE KIND OF STOPPING SHORT AT LEAST NOW OF TYING IT DIRECTLY TO MEETING CERTAIN PRODUCTION GOALS SO THAT THE THE MINISTRATION MAYBE TAKEN SOME STEPS TO MITIGATE SOME OF THE CONCERNS THERE. ANOTHER ISSUE THOUGH IS THAT. YOU KNOW THIS PART OF FUNDING OBVIOUSLY WAS SET FORTH BY THE LEGISLATURE AND APPROVED BY THE VOTERS TO MEET ONE PURPOSE WHICH IS THE MAINTENANCE OF LOCAL STREETS AND ROADS -- AND THAT BY TYING IT. YEAH THAT MAY IN NO IN GENERAL. INCREASING THE APPROVAL OF HOUSING ACROSS THE STATE MAY BE WORTHWHILE BUT ATTEMPTING TO DO BOTH OF THESE GOALS WITH ONE PART OF FUNDING KIND OF REDUCES THE STATE'S ABILITY TO ACHIEVE BOTH OF THOSE GOALS [inaudible] YES. ANALYSTS IS BROUGHT UP A POINT IT WAS IT IS MY INTENT TO SPEAK A LOT ABOUT. AS WE PROCEED TO THE BUDGET. THE IDEA OF PUNITIVE ACTION. WITH SB ONE FUNDS TO CITIES AND COUNTIES. IS A SERIOUS SERIOUS BREACH OF PROMISE AND FAITH. TO THE VOTERS. WE WERE TOLD [inaudible] IN. AND SB ONE AND THEN THEY REJECTED THE REFERENDUM. THAT MONEY IS GOING TO BE GOING TO YOU. AND NOW TO THREATEN TO WITHDRAW THAT. IF THEY DON'T MEET HOUSING GOALS AND I'M GONNA TALK A LOT MORE ABOUT THAT AS WE PROCEED. THAT'S UNCONSCIONABLE AND IF THIS IS TO HAPPEN. IT OUGHT NOT HAPPEN SIMPLY IN A TRAILER BILL. TRAILER BILLS HAVE BECOME A VERY CORRUPT WAY TO IMPLEMENT THE BUDGET. AND MY FEAR. AND THAT'S WHY BRING IT UP EVERY CHANCE I GET. THAT IDEAS LIKE THIS TEND TO JUST SLIP IN. THE TRAILER BILLS. THE LEGISLATURE NOW IS DOING MAJOR POLICY EVERY YEAR SUBSTANTIAL. AND TRAILER BILLS. AND EVERY YEAR WE ENTERTAIN MORE TRAILER BILLS I THINK WE'RE UP TO SEVENTY ONE POSSIBLE THIS YEAR. IT WON'T END UP BEING THAT MANY BUT IT'S CERTAINLY GOING TO BE AND THEN IN THE FORTIES. WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL. AND THERE HAVE BEEN OCCASIONS. SEVERAL. WHERE I'M SITTING ON A SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE BUDGET? AND THAT'S THE ONLY COMMITTEE WERE THIS MAJOR POLICY ISSUES GOING TO BE DISCUSSED. NOW THE ONE THAT. ANALYSTS SUGGEST WILL BE DISCUSSED A LOT OF OTHER PLACES I SURE YOU. BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS. ABOUT PROCESS. TO ENSURE THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AND THE DAYS THE LOOSE WAY THAT WE USE TRAILER BILLS IS CERTAINLY PROBLEMATIC BUT GETTING BACK TO THIS POINT. I THINK WE DID A VERY GOOD TREAD VERY SOFTLY. ON ANY PUNITIVE ACTION. TOWARDS AREAS THAT DON'T MEET THEIR HOUSING REQUIREMENTS. IN ANOTHER ITEM I'M GOING TO EMPHASIZE A POINT THAT WILL RELATE TO THIS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR A LET ME [inaudible] TO THAT. THANKS OF A FOLLOW ON THE CENTER NIELSEN QUESTION SO TELL ME HOW EXPLAINED TO VOTERS. THAT VOTED FOR SB. ONE THE NEXUS BETWEEN HOUSING IN AND WHAT THEY VOTED FOR AND SB. ONE SO WE BELIEVE THAT THERE'S A VERY STRONG NEXUS BETWEEN HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION OBVIOUSLY NEED THE ROADS TO GET TO YOUR HOUSE AND TO YOUR WORK -- BUT I DO WANT TO KNOW THAT TO THE SENATOR'S COMMENTS THAT WE HAVE WRITTEN IN A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS TO UNDERGO AN TO REVIEW THE TYPES OF FUNDS THAT WILL BE ELIGIBLE. WE'VE SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED THAT THIS PARTICULAR FUND HOWEVER I WOULD NOTE THAT THE THE REQUIRE. FACE CAN NOT HAVE THOSE FUNDS WITH HELD OUR ACTUAL REQUIREMENTS NOW THEIR CURRENT LAW THAT JURISDICTION'S ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH ITS NOT ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS AND IT'S NOT PRODUCTION. GOALS AT THIS TIME SO SANTA THE CONCERNED HOW YOU DO EXPLAINED I WOULD SAY THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE INVOLVED STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR LOCALS TO BE IN COMPLIANCE BEFORE THOSE FUNDS ARE WITHOUT. OKAY SO WHEN THE VOERS SAYS LOOK AT I THOUGHT SB ONE WAS ABOUT ROAD IMPROVEMENTS. AND I SEE THAT THE STATE IS USING IT FOR LEISURE ALL IMPORTANT I MEAN HOUSING IS VERY IMPORTANT. BOB USING FOR HOUSING AGAIN HOW. TELL ME I I GOT THE WHOLE STAKEHOLDER THING AND OTHERS ARE GOING. TO TALK ABOUT IT BUT YOU KNOW. TO THE VOTER IN GARDEN GROVE WHO VOTED FOR SB ONE BECAUSE FOLKS TOLD THAT PERSON THAT IT WAS GONNA BE USED TO ROADS. EIGHT I NEED THE THIRTY SECOND EXPLANATION AS TO WHAT THAT. NECKLACES ACKLES THAT DEBBIE DR HOUSING POLICY THE CIA JUST WANNA QUICK TOP LINE THIS IS TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE'S RIGHT THE SHORT TERM SELECT OPTION AND THIS LONGER TERM SO THAT EVERYTHING WOULD THAT WOULD BE DISCUSSED MEDICAL POSSIBLE COME BACK TO YOU OFFER RECOMMENDATIONS IN ORDER TO ADOPT RIGHT. SO THERE'S A BLANK THE PROCESS BY WHICH ANY CONCERN VOTER COULD RAISE OR YOU KNOW THROUGHOUT THROUGHOUT THAT PROCESS AND TO BE ABLE. ROBUST DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER THAT MADE SENSE IN TERMS OF TRYING OTHER. YOU KNOW COMPLY TO OTHER STATE HOUSING LAWS TO CERTAIN FUNDING SOURCE SO I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT TO MAKE IN A MULTI YEAR DISCUSSION PROCESS NOTHING'S HAPPENING NOW IN THIS TRAILER BILL TO ENACT THAT. SO. TO THAT POINT RIGHT THERE ARE -- COMPLIANCE WITH HAVING ABOUT HOUSING ELEMENT FOR LOTS OF HOUSING RESOURCES AND EVEN FOR ALREADY FOR SB ONE PLANNING GRANTS. THAT'S A THRESHOLD REQUIREMENT SO THIS IS A WHAT DOES SEEM YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF THE CONVERSATIONS BEEN AROUND IN OH WOW THIS ONE IS GONNA TAKE ME THERE ACTUALLY IS A PRECEDENT FOR US TO SAY HEY YOU NEED TO BE COMPLIANT WITH CERTAIN ASPECTS OF HOUSING LAW. TRANSPORTATION LAW THAT EXISTS BECAUSE THEY ARE INTERCONNECTED IN THE PLANNING PROCESS RIGHT SO IF YOU'RE YOU'RE. YOUNG COMING YOUR NOSE AT LIKE THE HOUSING CORRECTION PROCESS BUT YOU WANT THOSE TRANSPORTATION DOLLARS OR VICE VERSA RIGHT -- THAT COULD BE A ROBE A PART OF THE ROBUST DISCUSSION CYCLIC PROCESS BUT I THINK THE ANSWER IS NOTHING IS BEING DONE RIGHT NOW WE WANT TO DISCUSS THOSE IN A REAL HOLISTIC AND TRANSPARENT WAY. IN A LONG TERM PROCESS NO I I THINK THE DISCUSSION OF GET VERY ROBUST. SO. BUT I GUESS WE'RE NOT TRYING. TO SNEAK THAT IN HERE I TRAILER BILL THERE'S A LINK TO THE SOUL AND WHAT I'M SORRY GO AHEAD IF I MANAGING FOR THE PROVISION Là AND IN THE BILL ITSELF AND I CAN PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AFTER THIS. BUT IT'S ALSO MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THOSE FUNDS WOULD NOT BE TAKEN AND THEN USE ON HOUSING THEY WOULD BE TAKING AND THEN REINVESTED IN -- TRANSPORTATION -- YEAH REDISTRIBUTION OF THE STATE FOR OTHER LOCAL CAR WELL LET ME TELL YOU THAT THE THE FELLOW OR MY ALLEN GARDEN GROVE WHEN WE SAY -- IT'S BEING I KNOW YOU'RE PAYING IT'S BEING RE DISTRIBUTED SOMEWHERE ELSE BECAUSE THE CITY'S NOT IN COMPLIANCE THAT'S BUT WE'LL LEAVE THAT FOR NOW. SO THE NEXT IS WITH RESPECT. TO OTHER LEVERS USED -- TO MAKE SURE THAT THE HOUSING ELEMENT IS COMPLIED WITH -- GOVERNOR SUIT HUNTINGTON BEACH AND THE AYE. I DON'T BELIEVE IN PEAKING TOO EARLY SO AS I SIT HERE I GOT A LETTER FROM THE GOVERNOR SAYING THAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS GONNA GAUGE IN CONVERSATION WITH CITY HUNDRED BEACH GREAT. BECAUSE I DON'T THINK LAWSUITS ARE THE WAY TO MOST EFFECTIVELY RESERVE. TO BE RESOLVED. OF THIS CONTROVERSY SO I'M I'M REALLY PLEASED TO SEE THAT. WHAT OTHER CITIES ARE SORT OF IN THE SIGHTS OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN TERMS OF FILING SUIT? OF IN TO TO BE IN COMPLIANCE SPEC [inaudible] IN POPULATION. WHO IF SANCTIONED WOULD HAVE ALMOST ZERO IMPACT IT WAS COOL KIND OF THE DELICIOUS IRONY OF IN SINGLING OUT FREQUENT? HUNTINGTON BEACH I DON'T LIKE IT EITHER. BUT WE DON'T MY GOODNESS. WELL I WILL SEE THIS IS WE LIVE IN IN YOUR SIGHTS. I WOULD BE TO ANY ANY PENDING LITIGATION I WILL CONNECTED BACK TO THIS RIGHT THE THE PLANNING GRANTS BEING PROPOSED ARE NOT TIED TO BEING HAVING HOW ABOUT HOUSING ELEMENT IN THE PLANT IN FACT THEY CAN BE USED TO GET INTO COMPLIANCE SO THERE'S A REAL LONG. YOU KNOW RUN AWAY RIGHT TO MAKE SURE IF WE CAN HELP ANY JURISDICTION GET COMPLIANCE ALREADY. WITHIN THE FIRST COUPLE MONTHS OF THE GOVERNOR'S TERM WE HAVE ENGAGED IN A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS WITH THOSE RESTRICTIONS WERE VERY PRO ACTIVELY TRYING TO HELP THEM GET INTO COMPLIANCE. ONE THAT WAS ON THE INITIAL LIST OF FORTY SEVEN NOT QUITE RESTRICTIONS THAT EXISTED THE STAR THE GOVERNOR'S TERM OTHERS WILL. I WE'VE BEEN RUNNING QUITE A BIT TACKLE SYSTEMS AND THE GOVERNOR'S INTEREST IS TO FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO HELP YOU KNOW IT'S PROVIDED AND THEY THESE PLANNING GRANTS ARE. YOU PUTTING THAT FORTHRIGHT HEY WHATEVER YOU NEED TO GET TO THE TO TO WHATEVER IT TO BE MORE HOUSING FRIENDLY HAVE A POLICIES THAT. PRIMER DEVELOPED DEVELOPER CERTAINTY TO REDUCE REGULATORY BURDEN LET'S TAKE CARE OF THOSE SO THAT WHEN THE MARKET EXISTS FOR HOUSING IN YOUR JURISDICTION YOU ARE READY TO GO AND OPEN FOR BUSINESS. TO DO HOUSING SO THERE'S QUITE A BIT AND THAT IS THE NEW PART OF THIS PROCESS I WOULD NOTE THESE PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS THAT COULD BE A PART OF THE INCENTIVE PAYMENTS. ARE VERY SIGNIFICAN IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE FUNDED AT THE STATE LEVEL BEFORE IN TERMS OF ACTUAL PLENTY DOLLARS -- TO DEAL WITH MAYBE SECRET STREAMLINING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SPECIFIC PLANNING -- POSTED FEE THE SCHEDULES PROVIDING THOSE THINGS THAT DEVELOPERS NEED SO THAT THAT COMMITTEES MAYBE THAT. YOU KNOW DIDN'T MAKE SENSE DIDN'T PENCIL OUT TO BUILD HOUSING FOR NOW NOW DO RIGHT BECAUSE WHEN I LOOK AT THAT IS ABOUT FOR SAY OKAY THAT IS A RIGHT PLACE TO GO TO GO DEVELOP WILL THERE BE MORE CREATIVE AND AND FOR THE LEVEL SO. THAT IS THE THESIS BEHIND THE THE FRONT LOADING OF THE PLANNING GRANT AT BOTH THE LOCAL JURISDICTION IN THE RETAIL LEVEL IS TO GET READY SO THAT THIS KIND OF SHORT TERM CATALYTIC. INCREASE PRODUCTION PROGRAM CAN CAN HELP BUT ALSO LONG TERM RIGHT IF YOU PUT THOSE POLICIES IN PLACE. KLAY RIGHT YOU'RE MORE OPEN FOR BUSINESS YOU READY TO DEVELOP MORE ON A LONG TERM BASIS AND SO. I DID WANT THAT TO TO GO WITHOUT MENTIONING. SO THOSE ALL THOSE RESOURCES IN ADDITION TO ALL THE STUFF FOR OF COURSE ALREADY DOING WITH WITH WITH JURISDICTIONS. WHEATLAND -- WE ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO IN SITTING DOWN WITH THANK YOU CAN VIEW YOUR CAN GET YOU CAN GET COMPLAINT WE DOING THAT WITH A NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS AND LIKE I SAID WE HAVE. ALREADY GOTTEN SOME BACK IN THE COMPLIANCE CERTAINLY -- IT A LOT OF FIRE ANDERSON JURISDICTIONS THAT HAD BEEN NON RESPONSIVE -- THAT'S THAT'S WITHOUT QUESTION -- BUT WE EVEN HAVE A NUMBER OF OF HOUSING UNLESS IN FOR OF YOU SO WE'RE HOPE WE'RE OPTIMISTIC THAT THAT NUMBER WOULD YOU SIGNIFICANTLY. JUST JUST AS A MOTHER ANOTHER POINT I MADE MY LIVING AS A LITIGATOR -- AND SO. THERE'S A TIME AND PLACE -- I AM CONCERNED THAT LOTS OF TAXPAYER MONEY MAY BE WASTED. I SUPPOSE NOT WASTE IF YOU'RE THE ACTUAL LITIGATOR BUT BUT WASTED -- IN LITIGATION SO TO THE EXTENT THAT AGAIN WE WE CAN COME TO A RESOLUTION. WITHOUT RESORTING LITIGATION -- THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I HOPE WE CAN DO I'LL CONCLUDE BY COMMENDING THE GOVERNOR FOR AGREEING. TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WITH HUNTINGTON BEACH AND AND PERHAPS WE CAN AVOID. WASTING TAXPAYER MONEY. BUT YEAH I MEAN YOU HAVE IT MAYBE ADD IN THE YOU KNOW YOU PRIVACY IN THE GOVERNOR WHAT CAME UP THERE AND SOME THAT WE ARE CERTAINLY ARE AWARE OF IT AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE -- EVEN OUTSTANDING STATE ACTION JURISDICTIONS ARE DON'T HAVE COMPLIANCE ON HOUSING ARE SUBJECT TO OTHER THIRD PARTY ACTION THAT IS ACTUALLY QUITE MORE PERVASIVE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL OF THIRD PARTIES SINGLE CITY SO. THERE IS A VULNERABILITY THERE OF BEING ON COMPLAIN THAT OFTEN REARS ITS HEAD THROUGH LITIGATION BUT NOT FROM THE STATE EVEN BEFORE LOCAL LOCAL. THANK YOU MANAGER -- YES. I WAS GOING TO BRING THIS UP IN A SUBSEQUENT ITEM BUT I MAY WILL BRING IT UP NOW BECAUSE IT'S ENTIRELY RELEVANT HERE. AND UNDERSTAND THIS PHENOMENA DID NOT OCCUR. ON YOUR WATCH YEAR WITH THE DID YOU TO MEMBERS BEING PRESENT NOR -- GOVERNOR NEWSOME [inaudible] PREVIOUS BUDGET. BUT WE HAVE HAD COUNTY. VERY WEALTHY COUNTIES COME IN AND ASK FOR LONG TERM EXEMPTIONS. EIGHT YEARS. FROM THEIR HIDING REQUIREMENTS. THEN SUCCEEDED IN GETTING IT IN THE BUDGET. AND NOT HAVE TO COMPLY. AND I THINK THAT IS THE ULTIMATE IN HYPOCRISY. IN SAN. MARCOS IN THE PAST. AND BECAME LAW THERE'S A PART OF THE BUDGET. THAT SHOULD BE UNDONE. THEN THEY SHOULD NOT. HAVE THAT LONG TERM EXEMPTION. EXACT THE ITEM OF INEQUITY UNFAIRNESS. AND DESTROYS VASE IN GOVERNMENT. AND IT TO ME THE HYPOCRISY OF A VERY WEALTHY COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE. THAT SELL WHAT WE NEED EIGHT YEARS TO DO THIS. BUT HUNTINGTON BEACH WE WENT NO NO. WE'RE GONNA HURT YOU. THAT IS NOT THE WAY WE SHOULD DO POLICY EFFECT POLICY AND CAL -- JUST ONE ONE MORE ITEM FOR ME THAT -- WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE EARLIER ISSUE IS AGAIN HOW MUCH OF THIS FUNDING IS NOT TARGETED AT HOUSING PRODUCTION. OR HOMELESSNESS AND THE USE OF SO MUCH MONEY -- FOR GENERAL PURPOSES. I MEAN. WE HAVE A REAL CRISIS AND I UNDERSTAND AND I REALLY APPRECIATE. EVERYTHING THAT THE GOVERNOR AND YOU AND OTHERS ARE DOING TO COME UP WITH. THE BEST IDEAS BUT THE ACTION OF HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS I MEAN THOSE ARE VERY THOSE ARE EMERGENCY ISSUES -- AND I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE KEEP PUTTING SO MUCH. OF WHAT CITIES AND COUNTIES TO USE FOR GENERAL PURPOSES. I THINK YOU'RE SPEAKING TO THE INCENTIVE PAYMENTS THE PART OF THAT OF THIS PROPOSAL -- I WOULD I WOULD FIRST SAY THAT THIS IS OBVIOUSLY I THINK THE GOVERNOR PERSPECTIVE A COMPLIMENTARY PROPOSAL ALL THE OTHER FUNDING WE HAVE OUT THERE FOR PRODUCTION -- FROM LAST YEAR'S HOUSING BONE THAT'S PASSED FROM A PERMANENT SOURCE FROM SB -- TO ON DOWN THE LINES EVEN SOME OF THE PROPOSALS -- THE IS THAT THE BUDGET HAS INCLUDED -- TO SPEAK TO THE GENERAL PURPOSE IS PART OF THE INCENTIVE PAYMENTS I WILL SAY -- HAVING WE HAVE WORKED IN THE CITY ON A NUMBER OF INCENTIVE PROGRAMS IN THE PAST AND WE HAVE HEARD A LOT OF ANECDOTAL -- EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE ACTUALLY BEING ABLE TO GET PROJECTS THROUGH AN APPROVED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BECAUSE THEY HAD THE COVER OF SAYING HEY IF YOU APPROVE THIS PROJECT WE'RE GOING TO GET MONEY FOR PARKS FOR EXAMPLE OR GONNA GET MONEY FOR THIS KIND OF PURPOSE THAT IS THE THESIS. BEHIND THIS PROPOSAL THAT IT SWEETENS -- SO TO SPEAK THE INCENTIVE TO PRINT TO APPROVE HOUSING WHICH WE KNOW SOMETIMES CAN HAVE A TOUGH ROAD OF GETTING THROUGH THE LOCAL PROCESS AND SO. THERE ARE -- A LOT OF INSTANCES -- THAT WE ALL OFTEN HEAR ABOUT OF THAT BEING A VERY IMPORTANT TOOL -- TO A DEVELOPER TO TO A CITY -- INTEREST MAYBE RECALCITRANT THERE CATHERINE CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS ARE KIND OF SURPRISED ME NOT WANT TO FOR HOUSING IS A OKAY WILL I I'M GOING TO PROVE THIS BECAUSE I KNOW WE'RE ALSO GOING TO GET THESE RESOURCES THAT WE CAN USE. TO FUND OUR OTHER NEED WITH THE PARKS OR A PUBLIC SAFETY NEEDS ARE OR WHAT HAVE YOU SO THAT IS THE IDEA BEHIND THAT THAT THAT PROPOSALS IT. IS AN INCENTIVE -- NOTHING'S BEING PUNITIVE IN THIS WAY BUT IF IF IF CITIES ARE ABLE TO MEET HIGHER GOALS OF THE ARGUMENT PURSUE THESE THINGS THAT MAKE HOUSING EASIER TO BUILD -- MAKE IT MORE ATTRACTIVE DEVELOPERS COMMITTEE COMMUNITY AND THEN THE REWARDED BY YOU KNOW SOME PAYMENT FOR GENERAL PURPOSES CERTAINLY IT'S INCHING POLICY BUT I'M SAYING THAT'S THE THAT'S THE THESIS BOND THAT ARE. ALL RIGHT AND WE'RE QUESTION SENATORS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE OF IF WE DO PUBLIC COMMENT. I'M SORRY REPUBLICAN OKAY. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE KIANA VALENTINE I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF TRANSPORTATION CALIFORNIA. WHICH IS A NONPROFIT NONPARTISAN. ORGANIZATION OF BUSINESS AND LABOR INTEREST THAT HAVE -- ORGANIZED AROUND ADVOCATING FOR TRANSPORTATION SOLUTIONS IMPROVING THE X. AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN CALIFORNIA. I WANNA START BY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT HOUSING CRISIS THAT EXISTS IN THE STATE AND THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS THAT A LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. AT ALL INCOME LEVELS HAS ON THE ABILITY TO LIVE AND THRIVE IN THE STATE ABSOLUTELY. AND WE COMMEND THE GOVERNOR FOR HIS CALLING SUCH SIGNIFICANT ATTENTION TO THE CRISIS IN HIS BUDGET PROPOSAL. THROUGH ADD THE ONE TIME GENERAL FUND MONEY INVESTMENTS AS WELL AS SOME OF THE OTHER POLICY PROPOSALS THAT HE IS -- PUTTING FORTH BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE TO CAN AT THAT BEING SAID MY ASSOCIATION IS VERY CONCERNED. WITH THE PRESIDENT OF TYING HOUSING PRODUCTION OR PLANNING GOALS TO SB ONE OR ANY OTHER TRANSPORTATION FUNDING IN THE STATE -- AS BOTH THE LA -- NOTED AND A CENTER NEAREST NIELSEN NOTED WE THINK THIS RUNS IN THE FACE OF PROMISES THAT WERE NOT ONLY MADE. TO AT THE VOTERS IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN WITH -- THE PASSAGE OF PROPOSITION SIXTY NINE IN THE DEFEAT OF PROPOSITION SIX BUT MANY TIMES BEFORE THAT PROPOSITION FORTY TWO PROPOSITION. TWENTY TWO VOTERS ARE WILLING THEY HAVE SHOWN THEMSELVES TO BE WILLING TO PAY MORE AT THE PUMP AS LONG AS THAT MONEY IS GUARANTEED AND SPENT ON TRANSPORTATION. AND SPENT ON TRANSPORTATION IN EVERY SINGLE COMMUNITY FOR EVERY SINGLE MOTORIST IS PAYING AT THE PUMP AND AT THE REGISTRATION FEE EVERYONE IS DESERVING OF A QUALITY TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM IN THE STATE -- SECONDARILY THOUGH I DON'T WANT THE COMMITTEE TO FORGET THAT SB ONE WAS NEGOTIATED AND CRAFTED AFTER MANY YEARS OF CAREFUL NEGOTIATION AND DIALOGUE. TO ADDRESS ANOTHER CRISIS AND THAT WAS A TRANSPORTATION FUNDING CRISIS. THE STATE AND LOCALS WERE FACING A COMBINED ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY BILLION DOLLAR TEN YEAR FUNDING SHORTFALL FOR JUST THE MAINTENANCE. AND SAFETY OF OUR EXISTING SYSTEM. SO BY POTENTIALLY TAKING AS WE WILL BE IN PETER -- TO AGING BRIDGE HOLES PLEASE STREETS AN ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE DIRECTLY IMPACTING IN A NEGATIVE WAY THE MOBILITY AND SAFETY OF THE TRAVELING PUBLIC. AT SO THANK YOU FOR THE HEALTHY DIALOGUE THIS MORNING AND WE LOOK FORWARD -- TO CONTINUED CONVERSATION THANKS GOOD MORNING. MORTY MANAGER MEMBERS JASON RILEY CALIFORNIA CITIES AND THEY'RE CERTAINLY A AGREED DEAL DONE PACK IN THIS TRAILER BILL AND YOU KNOW IN THE BUDGET AUGMENTATIONS AT THE GOVERNOR'S LOOKING -- FOR WE CERTAINLY SHARE THE GOVERNOR'S DESIRE IN THE LEGISLATURE'S DESIRED INCREASE HOUSING -- IT'S BEEN ONE OF OUR TOP PRIORITIES FOR THREE CONSECUTIVE YEARS LEAVE CITIES WE WANT TO SEE MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE WILL SEE THOUSAND ALL INCOME LEVELS -- BUT WITH THEIR SPECIFIC REGARD TO SOME OF THE POLLS IN THE BILL THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR PLANNING WE'VE YOU THAT IS IT IS VERY IMPORTANT I'M COMES ON THE HEELS OF SB TO FUNDING -- WERE YOU SEE ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OR TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS COME OUT THE PLANET IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND I THINK IT'S EVEN MORE IMPORTANT AND THAT THERE WERE TWO BILLS IT PASSED THIS LEGISLATURE BUT A YEAR AGO. I'M SB A FIVE FORTY IN AB SEVENTY THREE THOSE BILL STREAMLINED THE HOUSING APPROVAL PROCESS YOU FRONT LOAD ALL THE ENVIRONMENT REVIEW YOU PROVIDE CERTAINTY TO DEVELOPERS YOU DO SEEK WERE AND ON THE BACK AND YOU HAVE BY RIGHT PROPOSALS WERE USE HAND THEM AN APPLICATOR THEY GIVE AN APPLICATION. WE HAVE A PERMIT AND THE BUILDING OCCURS NOBODY'S USE THOSE TWO BILLS THAT WENT THROUGH THIS LEGISLATURE BECAUSE RELEASE ANY FUNDING SO WE WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S DESIRE TO PUT MONEY IN THERE -- FOR PLANNING WE'RE GONNA SEE UNITS BUILT BASED ON THOSE TWO BILLS IF FOLKS GET MONEY TO DO THE PLAN ASSOCIATED WITH IT -- BUT WE DO SHARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS ARE ARE OF PLANNING THAT'S GOING TO BE REQUIRED IT'S A LITTLE UNCLEAR HOW WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO DO THAT IN THAT VERY SHORT TIME FRAME -- SO WE LOOK FOR TO DO SOME CONVERSATIONS OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ON THAT BECAUSE IF WE GET THIS LARGER READ A NUMBER OF FOR YOU KNOW FOR A COUPLE YEARS. WE WE WON'T HAVE THE ZONING IN OUR COMMITTEES NECESSARILY TO ABSORB THAT SO WE'RE GONNA GO HAVE TO DO SEQUEL WE'RE GOING TO MENTOR GENERAL PLAN HOW ARE WE IN A BILL TO DO ALL THAT IN A VERY SHORT TIME FRAME. SO WE CERTAINLY HAVE -- CONCERNS WITH THAT -- BUT ALSO THERE'S THIS FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE AND GET BACK TO CENTER NIELSEN COMMENTS ABOUT THE THE POLICY PROPOSALS THAT ARE HERE AND HOW YOU KNOW BIG THEY ARE AND HOW IT'S MUCH MORE THAN A TRAILER BILL. ON THE LANGUAGE IT'S A THE TRAILER NOW RUN THE COGS ON THAT'S GOING TO FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CITIES COUNTIES AND COGS. AND THAT'S A DISCUSSION I THINK THAT WE WOULD CERTAINLY WANT TO HAVE A BECAUSE IT'S BEEN VERY COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIP NOW -- IN THE FOR GONNA PUT THE COGS IN A POSITION WHERE THEY HAVE. YOU KNOW IT CAN SECOND GUESS ACTIONS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL I THINK THAT'S GONNA COMPLICATE THAT RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE OUR CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS AND CAN I CAN SUPERVISORS. SAID ON THAT VERY CAUGHT SO WE CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS AROUND THAT AND THEN FINALLY THE LINKAGE BETWEEN HOUSING PRODUCTION OR HOUSING PLANNING AND ONE DOLLARS. AND WE DO SHARE THE CONCERNS THAT THE KIANA MENTIONED ---WE FEEL THAT IT WOULD BETRAY THE THE VOTERS AND GOVERNOR COMMITTED WERE THE LEGISLATURE OF BECAUSE WE NEED MORE HOUSING SUPPLY AND THERE'S A WAY TO DO IT -- AND WE WANT TO TAKE PART IN THAT SO THANK YOU. CHRISLEY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES I'M SURE A LOT OF THE CONCERNS MENTIONED BY PRIOR SPEAKERS BUT DID ONE ADULT A BIT A CONTEXT THERE'S A THIRD OF THE COUNTY STATEWIDE ARE UPDATING THEIR HOUSING ELEMENTS DO EITHER THIS YEAR. OR IN TWENTY TWENTY SO I THINK WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW THAT PROCESS WHICH IS KIND OF THE ONGOING PLANNING PROCESS. WHICH CONTINUES INTERACTS WITH THIS NEW SHORT TERM PLANNING PROCESS OF FOLKS WILL BE HAVING HIGHER SIX CYCLE NUMBERS VERSES EVERYONE ELSE WILL HAVE DIFFERENT SORT OF FIFTH CYCLE NUMBERS THAT THIS NEW PROCESS. OUTLINED IN THE TRAILER BILL IS BASED UPON SO FOR THOSE MOSTLY RURAL COUNTIES I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION. I'M WE ALSO ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF PLANNING FUNDING -- FOLKS ARE VERY EAGER TO GET THEIR APPLICATIONS IN FOR SB TO PLANNING GRANTS WHICH ARE JUST ABOUT TO COME ONLINE NEXT MONTH SO MORE FUNDING -- FOR THOSE IMPORTANT ACTIVITIES IS OBVIOUSLY HELPFUL FOR EVERYONE -- ON THE SIDE OF THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS I THINK IN COUNTY WORLD A LOT OF WHAT WE REALLY NEED. AFTER WE DO THAT PLANNING IS IMPLEMENTATION FUNDING SO DO WE NEED TO UPGRADE A SEWER PLANT OR BUILD A SEWER PLANT SO WE CAN HAVE DENSER HOUSING IN UNINCORPORATED NEIGHBORHOOD. DO WE NEED TO OFFSET SOME OF THE OTHER COST SO THAT IT DEVELOPMENT THAT WOULDN'T BE PROFITABLE MIGHT ACTUALLY BECOME PROFITABLE WITH THAT INVESTMENT AND SO I THINK THE FOCUS ON PLANNING IS GOOD. BUT IN THE END OF CORPORATE AREAS ESPECIALLY IN SURE -- IS ALSO NECESSARY -- WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THAT BROADER CONVERSATION ABOUT UPDATING THE LONG TERM PRODUCTION GOALS. WE DO SHARE THE RETICENCE ABOUT LINKING TRANSPORTATION FUNDING WITH HOUSING FACTORS THAT ARE BEYOND LOCAL GOVERNMENT CONTROL AND APPRECIATE THE PIVOT TOWARDS PLANNING AND ZONING RATHER THAN PRODUCTION BUT AGAIN WE WANT TO BE AT THE TABLE FOR THAT AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU. I I APPRECIATE THE POINT YOU MADE ABOUT. SO I APPRECIATE THE POINT YOU MADE ABOUT OF YOU KNOW IMPLEMENTATION MONEY SO WITH THE STORE. I THINK ANY KIND OF CONNECTION -- IS DIFFERENT FROM JUST GENERAL PURPOSES IF THERE'S A REAL NEXUS A REAL CONNECTION SO LIKE YOU SAID HOUSING. SO WE NEED. TO MODERNIZE OR RENOVATE OUR SEWAGE SYSTEM THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO ME BUT JUST TO USE IT. FOR BROADLY SOMETHING ELSE I SWEAR I HAVE A PROBLEM BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON THREE ZERO COUNTY REPRESENTS OF CALIFORNIA ALSO ONE ECHO THE COMMENTS OF THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS -- AND POINT OUT THAT -- IN THE WITH THE LA -- WE AGREE THAT REALLY THE EFFORT -- TO FIND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND HELPING WITH PLANNING BUT WE WE THINK THAT OUR TIME WHEN IN MONEY AND EFFORTS OF PARTY BETTER SPENT AT LOOKING AT THE LONG TERM GOALS AND RINA -- THIS PROPOSAL ITSELF ACKNOWLEDGES THAT RINA IS FLAWED AND THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT AND SO. TO BASS SHORT TERM PLANNING GOALS ON SOMETHING THAT WE KNOW IS FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED AND WE NEED TO REVAMP SEEMS LIKE -- SETTING UP LOCALS -- FOR FOR FAILURE IN STATE WHY PRODUCTION OF HOUSING -- FOR FAILURE -- ADDITIONALLY OBVIOUSLY WE WOULD BE VERY OPPOSED TO ANY LINKAGE WITH THAT TRANSPORTATION FUNDING ESPECIALLY RURAL AREAS WHERE -- OUR ROADS ARE IN. SERIOUS DISREPAIR AND SOME OF THE NORTHERN PARTS OF THE STATE AND SO WE LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THAT FUNDING CONTINUES AGO TO TRANSPORTATION. AND AND ONE OTHER THING THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS HAVING THE LONG TERM RENO PROCESS CONVERSATION. THE ONE THAT'S HOLISTIC AND WE REALLY START TO DISCUSS -- HAVING THE STATE INCREASE -- WHERE WE ARE -- THE ROAD CONTINUE TO SEE DEVASTATING WIRE WILDFIRES AND THE RING IT DOESN'T REALLY TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION WE WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THAT CONVERSATION -- HOLISTICALLY AND LOOK AT THOSE AREAS AND WHAT WE CAN DO TO NOT CONTINUE TO DO. MORE PRAT HOUSING PRODUCTION THOSE AREAS THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS JEAN HEARST HER TAMMY HAVE THE URBAN COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA YOU'VE HEARD ON ALL THE POINTS FOR MY COLLEAGUES I DO WANT TO JUST MAKE CLEAR THAT URBAN COUNTIES ONCE AGAIN ARE VERY -- APPRECIATIVE OF THAT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR LOCAL PLANNING AND CERTAINLY SHARE THE SAME CONCERNS ABOUT TYING -- HOUSING PRODUCTION OR HOUSING PLANNING TO SB ONE DOLLARS WE'RE INTERESTED IN WORKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH YOU AND THE ADMINISTRATION ON COMING UP WITH SOME SOLUTIONS THAT. I CAN BE WORKABLE IN THE MOST POPULOUS AREAS OF OUR STATE AS WELL THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE. MOVING TO THIRTEEN I THINK IS. IT CONFUSING THAT. V. ANYWAY. THIRTEEN IF THEY DANIEL IS THE AGAIN WITH THE EACH CD [inaudible] ATVS ROLE. IMPLEMENTING STATE HOUSING LAWS AND INVOLVEMENT AT THE LOCAL REGIONAL AND STATE LEVEL IS KEY TO EFFECTIVELY ACHIEVING THE STATE'S HOUSING GOALS. REVIEW OF LOCAL HOUSING ELEMENTS INSURERS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ADEQUATELY PLAN TO ME EXISTING. AND PROJECTED HOUSING NEEDS AND PRIORITIZE INVESTMENTS IN HOUSING FOR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. IN ADDITION RECENTLY PASSED LEGISLATION EXPANDS EIGHTIES ROLE NOT JUST REVIEWING BEEN FORCING JURISDICTIONS COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR OWN HOUSING ELEMENTS. IS THE REQUEST ONE MILLION THREE HUNDRED SIXTY ONE THOUSAND FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND ONE MILLION TWO HUNDRED FORTY ONE THOUSAND AND ONGOING GENERAL FUND IT ALREADY. FOR AN ADDITIONAL EIGHT HOUSING ELEMENT REVIEW POSITIONS FUNCTIONS FOR THE UPCOMING SIX CYCLE HOUSING I HELD HOUSING ELEMENT REVIEW PERIOD. ANTICIPATED TO BEGIN. TWENTY NINETEEN WE WILL NOW ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE DURING THE PROPOSAL NO -- I HAVE -- WOMEN. NO COMMENTS NO. COMMENT OKAY. UGH JUST OF IN TERMS OF THE WORKLOAD. HOW HAS THE -- THE RINA. CONVERSATION THAT WE JUST HAD HOW DOES THAT IMPACT YOUR WORKLOAD. WELL THE ALREADY EXISTING LAW AROUND RENO RIGHT AND SO THE RENO PROCESS. YOU KNOW CREDIT PRETTY PROCEEDS RIGHT THE THE HAVE THE NEED FOR A HOUSING ELEMENT SO FOR EXAMPLE WE'VE ALREADY GIVEN. SANDBAG THE ARENA FOR THE NEXT CYCLE AND THEN IT KICKS OFF WHEN THOSE HOUSING ELEMENT OR DO AS AS MENTIONED THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION THERE HOUSING L. WITH EVEN COMING DUE. LATER THIS YEAR -- FOR THIS NEXT CYCLE SO IT IS A IT IS A PROCESS THAT IS CONNECTED RIGHT THE DID THE WORK LOWER TALKING ABOUT HERE IS THE ACTUAL REVIEW THOSE HOUSING ELEMENTS ONCE THEY COME IN. SO THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT BACK AND FORTH BASICALLY THERE THEY ALL COME DO FOR CERTAIN REGIONS AT THE SAME TIME FOR WHENEVER THAT REGION APPROVED THE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLAN -- ANDRECEIVED ARENA SO WE HAVE HUGE PEAKS BECAUSE A GROUP LIKE THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SESSIONS GOVERNMENT'S HUNDRED EIGHTY CITIES THEY'RE ALL COME DUE AT THE SAME TIME THERE'S A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH WITH DRAFTS AND REVISIONS THAT THAT THAT. TAKES PLACE THERE ARE A LOT OF DECISIONAL NEW -- NEW LAWS THAT NEED TO BE COMPLIED WITH AS WELL AND SO -- WE WILL PROCEED RIGHT WITH THE THE CURRENT LAW -- WITH THAT RENO PROCESS THAT IS THE STATE SET IN STATUTE -- WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT THE OTHER AT NEXT ITEM RIGHT THERE THERE ARE SOME ACTION YOU LAWS AFFECT THAT RENO PROCESS IN OUR ABILITY TO LOOK AT THE METHODOLOGY THAT OCCURRED AT THE COUNCIL GOVERNMENT. LEVEL AND SO THAT IS OUR STATE LAW AS WELL. SO -- REALLY IS THIS IS ABOUT OUR WORK LOAD IT'S GONNA COME IN BASED ON THE EXISTING LAW IN OUR HOUSING ELEMENT. CENTER DID NOT RENDON I'D LIKE TO ADD THAT WE ENVISION THAT THIS WILL WORK WITH THE NEW PROCESS -- H. CD HAS A ROLE IN REVEALING THE HOUSING ELEMENTS AS AS ACT IDENTIFIED -- AND SO WE KNOW THAT THERE WILL BE AN ONGOING NEED FOR THESE POSITIONS AND WE CAN WRITE SIZE ONCE WE HAVE WITH THAT ADDITIONAL PROCESS. LOOKS LIKE IN A FEW YEARS AND IT JUST EMPHASIZE ITS CURRENT WORKLOAD SAT BASED ON CURRENT LAW [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. SENATE OF PUBLIC COMMENT. OKAY APPRECIATED THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NOW WE GO ON TO ISSUE. FOURTEEN THE REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION PROCESS ALSO KNOWN AS THE ARENA DETERMINES THE AMOUNT OF INCOME DISTRIBUTION OF HOUSING DEVELOPMENT CAPACITY EACH SITTING COUNTY LAST KNOWN OVER FIVE TO EIGHT YEAR PLANNING PERIOD. AND IS INCLUDED IN EACH JURISDICTIONS HOUSING ELEMENT. AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY ONE INCREASES TRANSPARENCY IN THE RING ALLOCATION PROCESS AND PROVIDES JURISDICTIONS AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC ACCESS TO MORE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW RENOWNED CATIONS ARE CALCULATED. SENATE BILL EIGHT TWENTY EIGHT AS METHODOLOGY REVIEW REQUIREMENTS FOR A CD IN THE RENO PROCESS. THE CITY IS REQUESTING TO POSITIONS. SB. EIGHT TWENTY WE'RE REQUESTING SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND FIVE HUNDRED FORTY THREE THOUSAND ON GOING FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO FUND THESE THREE POSITIONS. AND COMING NO [inaudible] NOTHING. QUESTION. AND HOW DOES THIS RELATE TO YOUR OTHER REQUEST WITH RESPECT -- TO LOCAL JURISDICTION PLANNING NEEDS ETCETERA. THIS IS A SEPARATE THIS IS COMPLETELY SEPARATE. SO THIS REQUEST IS BECAUSE WE PASSED THESE LAW PASSES I'D LOVE THE SPECIFIC LAWS -- YOUR LAST FALL AND WHAT THIS DOES IS IT DOES GIVE A CITY AND STATE THERE FOR A LITTLE MORE -- ENFORCEMENT OR REVIEW AUTHORITY OVER -- THE REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS -- ALLOCATION OF RENO AS WELL AS BILLS AND SOME ADDITIONAL METHODOLOGY THESE TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN THOSE THINGS WHEN WHEN THE ACTUAL. RINA NUMBERS ARE DEVELOP SO. I THINK PEOPLE MAY KNOW THIS BUT LIKE THE RENO ACTUAL READING NUMBERS WE GIVE THEM TO THE LARGE REGION THERE THEN DISPERSED AT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL. AND SO THESE BILLS RESPONDED TO I THINK -- FROM CRITICISM AROUND HOUSE SOME OF THE PROPHECIES HAD WORKED. US IN EQUITY AND HOW THIS DISTRIBUTION SAID. AS OF NOW -- AT THE REGIONAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL THEY WILL -- HAVE TO KIND OF DEFEND THOSE NUMBER METHODOLOGY WE NOW GET THE ABILITY TO REVIEW THAT METHODOLOGY MAKE SURE IT IS SOUND. SO THE IDEA HERE IS WE SHOULD -- REDCE THOSE INEQUITIES THAT OCCURRED -- THROUGH THAT GREATER TRANSPARENCY SO THERE IS -- SOME ADDITIONAL WORK LOVE YA WE ALREADY DO RIGHT IN THE BILL THE NEED TO REVIEW THAT THOSE AND AND DEVELOP THOSE KIND OF METHODOLOGY SYSTEM THROUGHOUT THAT PROCESS I DO AMERICAN WILL BE SOME. BACK AND FORTH WITH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE -- ANGLE AND WE ALREADY OF COURSE ARE ENGAGING WITH THEM ON ON HOW THESE ON WHAT THE EXPECTATIONS ARE CAUSES ARE OF COURSE ALREADY IN LAW. OKAY SO WE PASS THE LAWS AND I I DON'T. IN IT BUT EVEN BETTER NOW RIGHT. WE PASSED A NEW LAW IN. NEW LAWS SO I GOT THAT PART. OKAY SO YOU KNOW WE WE MODIFY OUR WORKLOAD RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S STATE LAWS OF JANUARY FIRST -- BUT CERTAINLY THERE'S ADDITIONAL WORK LOAD IN ORDER TO FULLY FULLY SEE THE VISION OF THESE AN ON GOING BASIS -- AND WE WILL GET HIT WITH A LOT OF THE NEED TO REVIEW A LOT OF THESE A SHORT TIME THESE COME IN ALL AT ONCE AND CERTAINLY AN ON GOING YOU TO ASSIST -- ASSIST REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THEIR OBLIGATIONS LOS. AT IT. OKAY. THEY WORK WITH THE SOME OF LEAVE ME. RIGHT NOW IN IGNORANCE NOTHING ABOUT HER SO. TIME OKAY -- APPRECIATE PUBLIC COMMENT. THE NUN OKAY THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH -- ISSUE FIFTEEN MODERATE INCOME HOUSING PRODUCTION THIS REALLY FOR PRODUCTION [inaudible] OKAY. THE MIX THE COME HOUSING THE MEXICAN LOAN PROGRAM WAS CREATED BY SB TWO WHICH ALLOCATE 15% OF ON GOING REAL ESTATE TRANSACTION FEE REVENUES TO CREATE A MIXED INCOME HOUSING FOR LOW TO MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES COMPETITIVE LONG TERM FINANCING FOR NEWLY CONSTRUCTED MULTI FAMILY HOUSING PROJECTS RESTRICTED THE RESTRICTING IS BETWEEN THIRTY AND 100% OF EVERY MEETING COME. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES TO INVEST. FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND ONE TIME. ONE TIME IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSING FOR MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS AND I JUST WANNA KNOW YOU THAT CHALLENGE IF A WILL BE THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM. OKAY. THE COMMENTS. NOTHING TO ADD OTHER THAN THESE FINDINGS WHERE DODD ADD FUNDS FOR KELLY TO FACE EXISTING PROGRAMS. SO THERE'S NO PROGRAMMATIC CHANGES. UNDER THIS MODEL OF LA -- LE THIS PROPOSAL RAISES QUESTIONS FOR OUR OFFICE ABOUT HOW FUNDS ARE PRIORITIZED TO ASSIST IN THE HOUSE IN SPACE. THERE IS SIGNIFICANT NEED ASSIST -- TIES THE NEED OF THE LOWEST INCOME INDIVIDUALS IN THE CITIZENS OF THIS PUSHES THE INCOME LEVELS UP IN SUPPORT OF BROADER BROADER SCOPE OF THE STATE'S POPULATION. A GIVEN THE UNMET NEEDS THAT REMAINS FOR THE LOWEST INCOME WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD PRIORITIZE -- ACCORDINGLY [inaudible] YEAH. NO THIS JUST ILLUSTRATES A NEED THAT THIS IS. SORT OF SELF REFLECTION OF FOR A A CHART TO EXPLAIN. WHAT WHAT WE'RE DOING FOR THE LOWEST INCOME? INDIVIDUALS WHAT WE'RE DOING HOMELESSNESS WHAT WE'RE DOING FOR MODERATE. LEVELS OF THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS THAT EXIST THIS IS YOU DON'T NEED TO RESPOND TO THIS IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT -- ALL. PERHAPS IF YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO EXPLAIN ALL THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL. I THINK THAT'S A GREAT IDEA A GROUP. CAN JUST GET. GET STUCK IN A LOT OF SQUARES WITH MONIES AND THEN NOT KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT ADDS UP. TO DEPARTMENT FINANCE I DON'T KNOW THE WE HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT PREPARED BUT IF WE DO A CHECK AND I'LL HAVE TO SEND THAT OVER TO STAFF. I REMEMBER ONCE -- AND THE UNITED WAY BOARD TALKING ABOUT HOUSING NEEDS AND AND LA COUNTY. AND IF THERE WAS INFORMATION WE GOT INFORMATION ABOUT. THAT PRODUCTION OF HOUSING WASN'T. WASN'T AIMED AT MODERATE. INCOME LEVELS -- AND THERE WAS ACTUALLY I WAS MORE STAGNATED THAN EVEN THE PRODUCTION OF LOW INCOME THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE'S A GREATER NEED. AT THE LOW INCOME LEVEL BUT I REMEMBER THAT WAS THAT WAS A BIT OF A SURPRISE TO ME WHAT I I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS. REALLY WHAT'S THAT NEED AND SO MAYBE I WHY WOULD BE FOCUSED ON MODERATE INCOME. I I KNOW GENERALLY BUT NOT SPECIFICALLY WHY WOULD WE MAKE THAT A PRIORITY. SO IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING NOW IT'S MORE BECAUSE YEAH EVEN EVEN THOUGH WE'RE NOT THE ADMINISTERING ENTITY OF THIS SPECIFIC PROGRAM -- YOU KNOW IT STARTED WITHIN THE CONVERSATION AND SENATE BILL TWO CENTER AS AN AMERICAN THE BILL ON THE FROM A SOURCE BILL SO THAT ALLOCATED 15% TO ADDRESS KIND OF MIDDLE INCOME NEEDS THIS WOULD NOT GET AUGMENTATION FOR KIND OF THAT APPROACH -- EM. THIS VERY HIGH LEVEL MOST PROGRAMS BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE ARE RESTRICTED AT SERVING LOW INCOME FOLKS AT ANFIELD BELOW 6% -- VERY MEDIAN INCOME BUT THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE OF COURSE STRUGGLING THROUGHOUT OUR STATE GIVEN HIGH COST HIGH RISING COSTS -- TRADITIONALLY NO MIDDLE CLASS TEACHER FIVE FIVE SIX CETERA THEY CANNOT LIVE WHERE THEY WORK THAT IS PART OF THE ARGUMENT BEHIND A CERTAINLY -- IT IS COMPLEMENTARY TO SOME OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT SPECIFICALLY TARGET LOW INCOME HEALTH. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. PUBLIC COMMENT. SURE MEMBERS THIS IS A TANKER AGUMBE HOPEFULLY GET CALIFORNIA CITIES -- WE'RE SUPPORT OF THIS -- PROPOSAL -- FOR FOR FUNDING MORE MODERATE IN THE OHIO SO REPRESENTATIVE POINTED OUT THERE CERTAINLY ORAL MANY NEEDS OF FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE STATE. OF THIS SUB PROPOSITION ONE AND AN AXE AND ACTUALLY PROPOSITION TWO AND SOME OF THE RESOURCES THAT ARE JUST COMING ONLINE IT'S REALLY BEEN ABOUT A DECADE SINCE WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD REALLY MUCH AT ALL TO WORK WITH. A INCLUDING WITH THE ELIMINATION OF REDEVELOPMENT. THE MORE RESOURCES ARE COMING ON LINE. IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING MORE RESOURCES BUT A LOT OF THE FOCUS AT LEAST ON THE POLICY FOCUS IN THIS BUILDING IS IS THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT THE IT IS CERTAINLY THE THE ABILITY FOR WORK FORCE HOUSING -- CERTAINLY AND ALONG OUR COAST LINES WE HAVE REALLY HIGH DOLLAR -- LAND VALUES OF WORKER SEARCHES AND HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED WITH THEIR TEACHERS -- OTHER OTHER -- HIGH TECH WORKERS OTHERS HAVE BEEN A LOT OF CHALLENGES A LIVING WHERE THEY WORK. THE SOME OF THOSE -- INDIVIDUALS MANY OF THEM DO NOT -- THAT THEY MAKE MORE THAN AND SO HAVING SOME KIND OF RECOGNITION OF THIS -- THIS THIS ISSUE OF WORK FORCE HOUSING SOMETHING THAT'S OFTEN DISCUSSED IN THIS BUILDING AND HAVING SOME RESOURCES -- DIRECTED TOWARD THAT WE THINK IS APPROPRIATE -- AND END AT LEAST -- ADDRESSES ONE PORTION OF OF A NEED IN THIS STATE WHICH WE THINK OFTEN HAS NOT NOT REALLY BEEN FULLY ADDRESSED. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE TWENTY EIGHT TIME CHAPTER SEVEN EIGHTY FIVE AFFECTED TO THOUGHT OF AND FOURTEEN ALLOWED LOCAL OFFICIALS TO CREATE ENHANCED INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICTS. WHICH AUGMENT THE TAX INCREMENT FINANCING POWER IS AVAILABLE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS UNDER EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICT STATUTES. THESE EF IDEAS ARE ALLOWED TO ISSUE DEBT UPON 55% VOTER APPROVAL HOWEVER ONLY THREE I. F.. E. I. F. THESE HAVE BEEN FORM SINCE THE STATUTE WAS CREATED WITH RENDON'S VALVE VALUABLE WAY -- TO ENCOURAGE PRODUCTION AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WE BELIEVE THAT MOVING THE 55% BUT A THRESHOLD AND MAKING CONFORMING CHANGES TI THE LAW WILL ENCOURAGE THE USE OF THIS PROVISIONS MAY BE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. YES WE WOULD. SO ON THIS ISSUE AND THEY NOTED TO US THAT THERE IS SOME AMBIGUITY ABOUT WHETHER THIS PROPOSAL IS IN CONFLICT WITH THE DEBT CLAUSE OF THE CONSTITUTION THANK YOU. CHRIS STILL DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- IN REFERENCE TO THAT I JUST LIKE TO KNOW THAT -- WE REVIEWED LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S CONCERNS AND WE'VE ALSO LOOKED AT THE CONSTITUTION AND THE OPERATIVE PROVISIONS SECTION. SIXTEEN ARTICLE ANNOUNCER ARTICLE SIXTEEN SECTION. EIGHTEEN WHICH STATES IN RELEVANT PART. FIND IT HERE. SAYS NO COUNTY CITY TOWN TOWNSHIP BOARD OF EDUCATION OR SCHOOL DISTRICT. SHALL OCCUR ANY INDEBTEDNESS RELIABILITY WITHOUT THE ASSENT OF TWO THIRDS OF THE VOTERS. AND THE COURTS HAVE HISTORICALLY INTERPRETED THAT AS BEING STRICTLY CONSTRUCTION THIS IS APPLYING ONLY TO COUNTIES CITIES TOWNS TOWNSHIPS BOARD OF EDUCATION SCHOOL DISTRICTS. SO CONSEQUENTLY -- IT IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S FORMALLY THE TWO THIRDS VOTE PROVISIONS NOT APPLY TO ENHANCE INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICTS. AND SIMILARLY WHEN -- WE CREATED THE I HAVE TO USE AND STATUTES. TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THE THE PREDECESSOR INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICTS REQUIRED A TWO THIRDS VOTE. AND THEN THE AYE ABUSE REQUIRED EXPRESSED THE SAME CONCERNS THAT THE NOT PREVENT THE LEGISLATION GOING FORWARD TO REQUIRE A 55% VOTE FOR THE ISPS. AND CONSEQUENTLY AGAIN THERE'S NOTHING IN THE CONSTITUTION THAT WE SEE THAT REQUIRES HER TO BE ANY BOAT REQUIREMENT WHATSOEVER. FOR THE STATE ISSUANCES. GREAT SOFT BY UNDERSTAND THIS SO THAT THE E. L. D. I. F. D.. CAN INCUR DEBT RIGHT YES SIR. OKAY -- IN THE E. F. I. D. IT KERR IS THAT AND AND HAT DEBT THEN IS ULTIMATELY ON THE TAXPAYERS BACK IS THAT RIGHT YES IT'S SIMILAR TO THE FORMER REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES RIGHT IS -- FITS TAX INCREMENT FINANCING SO IT'S NOT LIVING IN NEW TASKS ACTUALLY YOU CREATE THE IMPRINT. TO IN THE PROJECT AREA IN THE PROJECT RECEIVE THE INCREMENTAL GROWTH IN PROPERTY TAX AND CURSE WITHIN THAT PROJECT AREA THAT USES THAT INCREMENTAL GROWTH TO PAY THE DEBT SERVICE ON THE DEBT THAT IT ISSUES. SO IT'S NOT A NEW TAX LEVY PER SE ON THE VOTERS IS JUST A SWEEPING INCREMENTAL GROWTH AND PROPERTY TAX BUT OF A CITY DID THE EXACT SAME THING. THAT WOULD BE A VIOLATION THE CONSTITUTION IT WOULDN'T AND THE CITY CONTROLLED CITY CREATED ENTITIES SUCH AS JOINT POWERS AGENCIES DO NOT HAVE TO ACTUALLY GET VOTER APPROVAL FOR DEBT ISSUANCES. BUT THE CITY ITSELF DOES. OKAY BUT THESE ARE STATE CREATED I'M THESE ARE CREATED BY LOCAL ENTITIES CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE AUTHORIZED TO CREATE THEM. AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS A PARTNER THE OTHER LOCAL AGENCIES -- EXCEPT FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE NAY PARTNER TOGETHER TO ACTUALLY COME UP WITH A FINANCING PLAN AND CONTRIBUTE TAX TO THE FINANCING. SO LET'S COUNCILS OKAY WITH THIS NOW -- BOWL I THINK LEAD COUNSEL IN ADMINISTRATION HAVE A DISAGREEMENT ON THE INTERPRETATION OF SECTION -- SIXTEEN ARTICLE ARTICLE SIXTEEN SECTION -- EIGHTEEN WE RESPECTFULLY THINK THAT -- THAT. WE DON'T AGREE WITH THEIR INTERPRETATION. THAT'S OUR IN CHINA AS WELL THAT LEDGE COUNCIL -- FEELS THAT. HE WOULD BE IN THE SPACE THAT THE CONCERT A COMMUNICATED TO OUR OFFICE IS THAT BECAUSE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE PLEDGE JEAN SENSUALLY THEIR PROPERTY TAX. TOWARDS THE DEBT TO SORT OF BACK THAT THAT THAT THAT YEAH IF THESE ARE TAKING ON THAT IT WOULD BE CAPTURED BY THIS PROVISION OF THE CONSTITUTION. THE BECAUSE NONE OF THE THERE'S ONLY A FEW EFT IS IN EXISTENCE AND AS FAR AS WE KNOW NONE HAVE ACTUALLY TAKEN ON ANY BOND AT THAT HASN'T BEEN CHALLENGED. AND SO THEY'RE JUST FLAGGING THAT THERE'S A POTENTIAL FOR CONFLICT HERE. YOU KNOW JUST KNOW THAT YOU HAVE TO USE A VERY SIMILAR TO THE FORMER REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES WAS ALSO DID NOT REQUIRE VOTER APPROVAL TO ISSUE. SO WHAT THE INTO MAYBE THIS IS A CONVERSATION FOR ANOTHER TIME AND PLACE SO WHAT HAPPENS IF ONE OF THE E. F. ID'S. ENCOURAGED THAT SOMEBODY'S GONNA SOON RIGHT. THE MINUTEIT THERE'S AN AMBIGUITY SO THUS WE WE WE RESPECTFULLY -- WOULD DISAGREE OF WHAT THERE'S AN AMBIGUITY ON SOME COULD CERTAINLY. A TAXPAYERS CERTAINLY CHALLENGE THE DENTIST RENTS AS THEY SAW FIT BUT WE THINK THE BASED ON THE PRIOR -- BODY OF COURT RULINGS IN CALIFORNIA THAT THE COURTS WOULD DISMISS THAT CASE. BECAUSE AGAIN THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT THAT. SECTION TOM ARTICLE SIXTEEN SECTION EIGHTEEN ONLY APPLIES THOSE SPECIFIC ENTITY YOU DON'T EVEN AGREE THERE'S AN AMBIGUITY WE DON'T WE WE RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH WHAT COUNSEL THERE'S AN AMBIGUITY. OKAY BUT LET'S ASSUME THAT LEDGE COUNCILS JUST. JUST INDULGE MY WRONGFULNESS FOR SECOND -- SO. THAT LEDGE COUNCIL BELIEVES IS AMBIGUITY LET'S ASSUME THE LEDGE COUNCILS RIGHT THERE THAT THERE IS AN AMBIGUITY IN SO ONCE THE TEST THAT THE COURT. WHAT WHAT I'M INTERESTED IN IS IS WHAT HAPPENS SO? A. D. F. I. D. ENCOURAGED THAT -- WHAT WHAT WHAT THEN HAVE WHAT'S THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE LAWSUIT WHILE IT'S PENDING? GOT SORT OF THE CERTIFIED DEED I WOULD HATE TO SPECULATE ON THAT IF. IF SOMEONE WERE TO SUCCESSFULLY CHALLENGE BUT DEBT ISSUANCE AFTER THE CURTAIN COURTS FOR DISABLED YOU'RE TOTALLY WRONG SECTION NOT NOT EVEN CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER IT'S SUCCESSFUL WHAT I'M INTERESTED IN IS THE PERIOD OF TIME WHILE THE LAWSUIT IS PENDING WHAT I THINK DURING THE PENDENCY THE LAWSUIT THAT THEY WOULD. STILL BE ABLE TO COLLECT TAX INCREMENT FINANCE THAT ON JUNCTION MAIN LESSER IS AN INJUNCTION [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] OKAY. FOR LEAVE IT OPEN THE OPEN A OKAY THANK YOU -- I'M SORRY I'M SORRY PUBLIC COMMENT. YOU'RE CURED WITH WE GET CALIFORNIA CITIES -- FIRST OF ALL WE DO SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL OR BY THE ADMINISTRATION AND ACTUALLY DO AGREE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES ANALYSIS THERE WAS A LOT OF ANALYSIS OF THIS ISSUE ESPECIALLY IN THE WAKE OF OF THE LOS REDEVELOPMENT OF JUST WHAT THE OPTIONS WERE GOING FORWARD -- I I THINK WHAT PROBABLY WILL HAPPEN IN MANY CASES IS BEFORE -- THEY'LL ISSUE DEBT -- THEY'LL PROBABLY WANTED TO DO A VALIDATION ACTION I MEAN THAT pGET THE ANSWER -- TO THIS IS -- IT AND IT BUT WE DO WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS FELT THAT THE 55% VOTE IN THIS LAW -- WAS IT NECESSARY AND EASIER SO FOR THIS REASON WE WOULD SUPPORT THANK YOU. OKAY ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- ISSUE. SEVENTEEN CAL HOME PROGRAM CHANGES. THE CALHOUN PROGRAM PROVIDES GRANTS AND APPROPRIATE FUNDS TO LOCAL PUBLIC AGENCIES AND NONPROFIT DEVELOPERS TO ASSIST INDIVIDUAL FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS TO DEFERED PAYMENT LOANS FOR DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE HOME REHABILITATION. INCLUDING MANUFACTURED HOMES NOW ON PERMANENT FOUNDATIONS ACQUISITION REHABILITATION ON BY COUNSELING SO FELT MORTGAGE ASSISTANCE OR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR SELF HELP HOMEOWNERSHIP. FUNDS ARE LOAN FROM GRANT RECIPIENTS TO INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS. DEMONSTRATION AS PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO ALLOW THE PROGRAM TO INCLUDE A THREE DWELLING UNITS IN JUNIOR SAYS REACH ONE UNITS. AND AUTHORIZED THE PROGRAM TO MAKE GRANTS FOR HOUSING PURPOSES AND DECLARED DISASTER AREAS. WITH THAT WILL ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS [inaudible] I KNOW [inaudible] OKAY. I'M AND CRYSTAL [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] PUBLIC COMMENT. YOU'RE GOING TO KILL FORTY CITIES TO SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OKAY MOVE ON THEN. OF ISSUE EIGHTEEN LOCAL HOUSING TRUST FUND. THE LOCAL HOUSING TRUST FROM PROVIDES MATCHING GRANTS TO LOCAL HOUSING TRUST FUNDS THAT ARE FUNDED ON AN ONGOING BASIS FROM. THERE ARE NONE OF THE RISE RESTRICTION RESTRICTED IN THE USE FOR HOUSING PROGRAMS. PRINT LEGIBLE RECIPIENTS INCLUDE CITIES AND COUNTING'S WITH ADOPTED HOUSING ELEMENTS THE CITY IS THE CHAIRMAN TO COMPLY WITH HOUSING ELEMENT LAW INSURABLE. WILL STRUCTURE WILL NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS. THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO ALLOW LOCAL HOUSING TRUST FUND TO MAKE MATCHING GRANTS MAEVE AMERICAN TRIES AND TO INCREASE. THE MINIMUM SIZE OF AWARDS TO VARIOUS LOCAL TRUST [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] NOTHING [inaudible] NOTHING [inaudible] COLLEAGUES [inaudible] OKAY -- OKAY. JUST ONE QUESTION DO THESE -- THESE ARE OF THE MONEY GOES TO THE MUNICIPALITY OR AN ORGANIZATION CAN YOU JUST DESCRIBE EXPLAINED A LITTLE BIT. YEAH THEY'RE TOO OLD BOB IF YOU CAN BE A A CITY OR COUNTY OR CAN BE A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION. AND IN GENERAL THEY ARE. THEY THEY THEY HAVE THE OPTION OF FINDING A VARIETY OF HOMEOWNERSHIP PROGRAMS THAT HELP PEOPLE BECOME OR REMAIN HOMEOWNERS. AND THEY MAKE THE CITY OR THE NONPROFIT AND WORKS WITH THE INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS WE DON'T DO THAT FROM SACRAMENTO WITH INDIVIDUAL PERSON SO WE HAVE THIS INTERMEDIARY WHICH IS THE CITY FOR THE NONPROFIT. AND THERE IS NO IT IT'S NOT BASED ON GEOGRAPHICAL AREA I MEAN. HOW DO WE KNOW THAT? YOU KNOW THESE LOANS ARE AVAILABLE ACROSS THE STATE OR WHERE MOST NEEDED HOW HOW DOES THAT HAVE WE'RE NOT ABLE TO FIND EVERY SITTING COUNTY THE FUNDING IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO TO FIND EVERY JURISDICTION AND AND NOT EVERYONE APPLIES AND NUMBER OF CITIES CAN YOU DON'T RUN THEIR OWN. SORT HOMEOWNERSHIP PROGRAMS NECESSARILY OF BUT WE WE IN THE COMPETITION WE DO HAVE SORT OF THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS. IN OR TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT IT. A GOOD AMOUNT IS A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SORT OF RURAL AREAS AND SO WE DO HAVE THESE GENERAL GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF PARAMETERS. BUT IT IS THAT WE DO NOT WE CANNOT FUND EVERY SITTING COUNTY THE FUNDS ARE JUST INSUFFICIENT FOR THAT [inaudible] OKAY. SO IT'S OKAY -- AND THE NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES TO JUST NOW BE INCLUDED AS AN ENTITY THAT YOU COULD. GIVE A GRANT. TO ACTUALLY BUT I THINK I THOUGHT YOUR TYPE OF THE CALHOUN PROGRAM WHICH I REALIZE NOW IS PROBABLY. TO TO ITEMIZE BEFORE. I'M RIGHT OKAY LOCAL HOW THE JUST AND MY MY MISTAKE AT LOCAL HOUSING TRUST FUND. IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT FIRST OF ALL -- THE WAY THE IT IS THE IT IS GENERALLY A CITY OR COUNTY THAT APPLIES ALTHOUGH IT CAN BE A NONPROFIT AS WELL THAT OFTEN IS SORT OF AN OFFSHOOT OR CITY COUNTY BUT THEY THEY ARE. THEY HAVE AN IDENTIFY REVENUE SOURCE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND WE ARE SORT OF MATCHING THAT RIGHT SO HERE'S THE ELIGIBILITY IS NOT JUST TO BE A CITY CAN OR NONPROFIT BUT IT IS ONE THAT HAS. YOU KNOW IDENTIFIED A A NEW RESIDENCE OR SO CITY FOR EXAMPLE THE CITY AND COUNTY SACRAMENTO. HAVE A COMMERCIAL LINKAGE FEE WHEN. WHEN COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS ARE BUILT THE COMMERCIAL PROPERTY DEVELOPER PAYS A CERTAIN AMOUNT? THAT HELPS THEN SUPPORT AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR THE WORKERS WILL BE WORKING IN THAT BUILDING SO THAT'S A DEDICATED REVENUE SOURCE AND WE'RE THIS PROGRAM THE IDEA OF IT IS TO ENCOURAGE. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND OTHERS TO SORT OF CREATE THESE NEW SOURCES WILL HELP YOU MATCH IT.
