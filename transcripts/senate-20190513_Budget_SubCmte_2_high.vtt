00:07:49.268 --> 00:07:50.837
THAT COULD PROVOKE ADDITIONAL

00:07:50.903 --> 00:07:52.572
WORK FOR OUR DEPARTMENTS SUCH AS

00:07:52.638 --> 00:07:55.608

REPORTING OF THOSE INSPECTIONS.

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:05.218
AND I WOULD NOTE THAT THE BOARD

SENATE BILL NINE A ONE INCREASES

00:08:20.066 --> 00:08:21.667
OUR WORKLOAD IT CAME WITH NO

00:08:21.734 --> 00:08:22.568
FUNDING.

00:08:22.635 --> 00:08:24.637
SINCE THIS BUDGET CHANGED.

00:08:24.704 --> 00:08:26.973
I GUESS THE QUESTION IS THAT YOU

00:08:27.039 --> 00:08:28.774
HAVE AN ANTICIPATION THAT

00:08:28.841 --> 00:08:30.376
THERE'S GOING TO BE MANY MORE OF

00:08:30.443 --> 00:08:32.011

THE DESIRED WORK DONE TO REDUCE

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:53.499
THE AMOUNT OF TIMBER.

00:08:53.566 --> 00:08:55.534
THAT'S A TWENTY AIMS TO TWENTY

00:08:55.601 --> 00:09:00.239
M. GO FAST AND DO MORE -- THE

00:09:00.306 --> 00:09:02.642
THING IS THIS IS THIS GOING TO

DO IT.

00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:05.778
GIVEN THE THE MAGNITUDE OF THE

00:09:05.845 --> 00:09:07.313
OR THE ANTICIPATION THE

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.682
MAGNITUDE OF THAT THE TIMBER

00:09:09.749 --> 00:09:12.385
HARVESTS PLAN CITY COULD BE --

00:09:12.451 --> 00:09:13.386

00:09:13.452 --> 00:09:16.155

YES IT WILL HELP US DO IT

00:09:18.658 --> 00:09:20.159
BECAUSE IN THE ABSENCE OF THIS

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:22.528
BUT TO CHANGE PROPOSAL WE WILL

00:09:22.595 --> 00:09:24.463
HAVE NO ADDITIONAL.

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:27.400
THIS PROPOSAL ADDS FIFTEEN STAFF.

00:09:27.466 --> 00:09:29.368
IT WE CAN PUT SPECIFICALLY ONTO

00:09:29.435 --> 00:09:31.671
THE ASSIGNMENT.

00:09:31.737 --> 00:09:32.338
OF ACHIEVING BOTH OF THOSE

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:34.607
OBJECTIVES FIRST.

00:09:34.674 --> 00:09:35.541
GETTING THE WORK DONE

00:09:35.608 --> 00:09:37.610
EXPEDITIOUSLY TO REDUCE OUR FIRE

00:09:37.677 --> 00:09:39.011
RISK SECOND.

00:09:39.078 --> 00:09:40.980
DOING IT IN A MANNER THAT'S MOST

00:09:41.047 --> 00:09:42.782
PROTECTIVE TO THE ENVIRONMENT.

00:09:42.848 --> 00:09:44.917
CALIFORNIA SHOWS IT'S NOT AN

00:09:44.984 --> 00:09:46.385
EITHER OR PROPOSITION.

00:09:46.452 --> 00:09:48.187
THE OPERATIVE WORD IS A IN.

00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:50.089
YOU CAN REDUCE THE FIRE RISK AND

00:09:50.156 --> 00:09:51.991
DO RIGHT BY OUR BY MIDDLE

00:09:52.058 --> 00:09:53.693
CONCERNED SIMULTANEOUSLY.

00:09:53.759 --> 00:09:55.294
THIS PROPOSAL ALLOWS US THE

00:09:55.361 --> 00:09:57.430
STAFF TO INVEST DIRECTLY INTO

00:09:57.496 --> 00:09:59.765
THAT DIALOGUE WITH HOW FAR.

00:09:59.832 --> 00:10:02.935
AND HOW IS IT GONE WITH.

00:10:03.002 --> 00:10:04.070
SLAVE KAISER HAPPENED TIMBER

00:10:04.136 --> 00:10:05.638
HARVEST LANCERS BEEN THAT YOU'VE

00:10:05.705 --> 00:10:08.574
WORKED WITH THE A CAL FIRE IN

00:10:08.641 --> 00:10:10.042
THE DIFFERENT AFFECTED AREAS

00:10:10.109 --> 00:10:12.945
AREAS HOW HAS THAT --

00:10:13.012 --> 00:10:15.348
COORDINATION WITH THIS ESTATE

00:10:15.414 --> 00:10:17.984
AGENCIES GONE BETTER.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:19.885
CERTAINLY IN MY TENURE IT'S HAD

00:10:19.952 --> 00:10:21.787
ITS UPS AND DOWNS.

00:10:21.854 --> 00:10:23.389
BUT IN MY PERSPECTIVE AFTER

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:25.958
ASSEMBLY BILL.

00:10:26.025 --> 00:10:26.592
FOURTEEN NINETY TWO WHICH IS THE

00:10:26.659 --> 00:10:27.827
OTHER THING THAT WAS DEBATED

00:10:27.893 --> 00:10:31.364
WHEN WE LAST MET AND MARCH.

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:33.733
OUR AGENCIES ARE CO LOCATED.

00:10:33.799 --> 00:10:35.101
OUR CO ASSIGNED TO A COMMON

00:10:35.167 --> 00:10:36.135
PURPOSE.

00:10:36.202 --> 00:10:38.104
AND WHILE THE DATA CAN REFLECT

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:41.240
DIFFERENT TRENDS I THINK OVERALL --

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:43.175
DATA COMING OUT OF THE

00:10:43.242 --> 00:10:45.311
IMPLEMENTATION OF FOURTEEN

00:10:45.378 --> 00:10:46.278
NINETY TWO SHOWS.

00:10:46.345 --> 00:10:47.880
IN MANY REGARDS WERE FINDING

00:10:47.947 --> 00:10:50.116
PERMIT EFFICIENCIES.

00:10:50.182 --> 00:10:51.617
IS IT A WORK IN PROGRESS AND WE

00:10:51.684 --> 00:10:53.119
DO BETTER ABSOLUTELY.

00:10:53.185 --> 00:10:53.786
BUT I THINK IF YOU LOOK

00:10:53.853 --> 00:10:55.821
BACKWARDS OVER THE LAST SAY FIVE

00:10:55.888 --> 00:10:57.089
TO SIX YEARS YOU'LL FIND DATA

00:10:57.156 --> 00:10:58.824
THAT SHOWS.

00:10:58.891 --> 00:11:00.092
EFFICIENCY TREND LINESARE UP

00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:02.061
NOT CATEGORICALLY ACROSS THE

00:11:02.128 --> 00:11:03.329
BOARD DOWN.

00:11:03.396 --> 00:11:04.730

00:12:53.405 --> 00:12:55.040
INDUSTRIES.

00:12:55.107 --> 00:12:56.475
BUT FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP YOU

00:12:56.542 --> 00:12:59.879
WOULD NOT HAVE HAD ASSEMBLY BILL.

00:12:59.945 --> 00:13:00.980
FOURTEEN NINETY TWO AND OUR

00:13:01.046 --> 00:13:02.081

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:08.554
HAS ALLOWED US TO REBUILD THE

00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:10.156
PROGRAM.

00:13:10.222 --> 00:13:13.058
BUT I WOULD SAY IN MY MIND

00:13:13.125 --> 00:13:13.692
FOURTEEN NINETY TWO AND THE WORK

00:13:13.759 --> 00:13:16.061
WE DO WONDER THAT.

00:13:16.128 --> 00:13:18.330
WELL PERHAPS RELATED IS SEPARATE

00:13:18.397 --> 00:13:19.798
FROM THE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL

00:13:19.865 --> 00:13:20.733
TODAY.

00:13:20.799 --> 00:13:22.568
LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT FOURTEEN

00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:25.004
NINETY TWO FROM AN THE NEXT

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:26.472
THING I'D SAY IS IT'S MORE THAN

00:13:26.539 --> 00:13:28.140
OUR DEPARTMENT IT'S STATE WATER

00:13:28.207 --> 00:13:30.242
BOARD IT'S CAL FIRE AND CAL FOR

00:13:30.309 --> 00:13:33.112
HAS NOT BEEN ENGAGED IN THE TO

00:13:33.179 --> 00:13:34.914

00:13:35.981 --> 00:13:38.117
THESE METRIC.

00:13:38.184 --> 00:13:39.852
SINCE WE LAST MET I THINK I

00:13:39.919 --> 00:13:40.819
MENTIONED I WOULD DO THREE

00:13:40.886 --> 00:13:42.788
THINGS.

00:13:42.855 --> 00:13:44.690
AND I'M REMISS ON ONE OF THEM.

00:13:44.757 --> 00:13:50.563
pHARD TO HAVE THE AGENCIES REPORT.

00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:53.199

TIMBER PROGRAM.

00:14:02.374 --> 00:14:03.542
AND I THINK THEY'RE TAKING A

00:14:03.609 --> 00:14:04.610
CAREFUL REVIEW OF THE NEXT

00:14:04.677 --> 00:14:06.912
REPORT.

00:14:06.979 --> 00:14:08.247
THE SECOND THING I SAID I

00:14:08.314 --> 00:14:10.216
BELIEVE I WOULD TAKE CARE OF IS

00:14:10.282 --> 00:14:11.116
PROVIDING YOU ADDITIONAL

00:14:11.183 --> 00:14:11.884

FINANCES SUGGESTED TO YOU A MOCK

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:19.225

00:14:21.227 --> 00:14:22.795
BUT I ALSO BELIEVE MY STAFF HAVE

00:14:22.861 --> 00:14:25.497
OFFERED YOUR OFFICE A SNAPSHOT.

00:14:25.564 --> 00:14:27.299

00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:37.276
THINGS.

00:14:37.343 --> 00:14:39.345

EXPLAINED TO ME YOU'RE RIGHT

00:14:40.412 --> 00:14:42.147
ABOUT THE SHIFT FROM A FOCUS OF

00:14:42.214 --> 00:14:43.816
GREEN TIMBER AND GREEN TREE

00:14:43.882 --> 00:14:46.385
HARVESTING. TO MORE OF THE TREE

00:14:46.452 --> 00:14:48.320
MORTALITY WORK I THINK THAT'S AN

00:14:48.387 --> 00:14:49.855
UNDERLYING FACTOR WILL WE SEE IN

00:14:49.922 --> 00:14:51.257
THE LAST COUPLE YEARS IS.

00:14:51.323 --> 00:14:52.758
COMPANIES SHIFTING OVER TO

00:14:52.825 --> 00:14:54.727
DEALING WITH TREE METALLIC.

00:14:54.793 --> 00:14:56.462
IN USING EXEMPTIONS.

00:14:56.528 --> 00:14:57.930
RATHER THAN PROCESSING AS MANY

00:14:57.997 --> 00:15:00.599
T. H. PLEASE.

00:15:00.666 --> 00:15:02.368
ANOTHER THING I'VE SEEN IS.

00:15:02.434 --> 00:15:03.769
IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS

00:15:03.836 --> 00:15:06.639
WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD NEW -- ANIMAL

00:15:06.705 --> 00:15:08.841
SPECIES LISTED UNDER RELEVANT

00:15:08.907 --> 00:15:10.476
FEDERAL AND STATE LAW.

00:15:10.542 --> 00:15:11.577
AND I THINK THAT THAT HAS

00:15:11.644 --> 00:15:13.479
CONTRIBUTED TO SOME OF THE

00:15:13.545 --> 00:15:14.980
REVIEW PROCESS ON THE T. H. P.

00:15:15.047 --> 00:15:17.182
FRONT.

00:15:17.249 --> 00:15:18.651
I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT MY

00:15:18.717 --> 00:15:20.452
UNDERSTANDING IS CAL FIRES HAD

00:15:20.519 --> 00:15:23.489
SOME VACANCIES -- IN PARTICULAR

00:15:23.555 --> 00:15:24.757
IN THE SANTA ROSA AND READING

00:15:24.823 --> 00:15:28.093
OFFICE WHICH ARE KIND OF THE HUB.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.495
THE T. H. P. REVIEW --

00:15:29.561 --> 00:15:31.563
ENTERPRISE THAT WE STOOD UP

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:33.499
BETWEEN OUR AGENCIES.

00:15:33.565 --> 00:15:36.702
LET ME JUST CHECK MY LOOK.

00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:38.170
IN BEFORE YOU GO TOO FAR SO --

00:15:38.237 --> 00:15:39.371
IN THAT WASN'T WHEN MY QUESTION

00:15:39.438 --> 00:15:41.740
SO IS THAT.

00:15:41.807 --> 00:15:42.875
JUST WANTED TO GET A CLEAR FIVE

00:15:42.941 --> 00:15:45.077
FROM EASTON OVER SO.

00:15:45.144 --> 00:15:46.645
THOSE VACANCIES AS CRITICAL

00:15:46.712 --> 00:15:47.913
VACANCIES ARE WITHIN ONE

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:49.248
DEPARTMENT OR ARE WE LOOKING AT

00:15:49.315 --> 00:15:50.316
MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS I

00:15:50.382 --> 00:15:51.917
UNDERSTAND HE'S CAL FAR OKAY BUT

00:15:51.984 --> 00:15:53.619
I'M DESCRIBING A SERIES OF

00:15:53.686 --> 00:15:55.421
THINGS WHICH I THINK IN THE LAST

00:15:55.487 --> 00:15:56.955
COUPLE YEARS.

00:15:57.022 --> 00:15:58.991
OUR WHAT IS UNDERLYING SOME OF

00:15:59.058 --> 00:15:59.992
THE TREND LINES YOU'RE

00:16:00.059 --> 00:16:01.593
POTENTIALLY HEARING OR SEEING

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:04.863
WHICH IS AN REVIEW OF DHT.

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:06.832
YEAH THE REVIEW TIME MIGHTBE

00:16:06.899 --> 00:16:07.533
CHANGING.

00:16:07.599 --> 00:16:09.201
OR THE SIZE OF THE AMOUNT OF

00:16:09.268 --> 00:16:11.637
ACRES INVOLVED IN THE PLANS

00:16:11.704 --> 00:16:13.839
APPEARS TO BE DECREASING RIGHT.

00:16:13.906 --> 00:16:15.574
AND I THINK THERE ARE REASONS

00:16:15.641 --> 00:16:17.976
FOR THOSE TRENDS ONE REASON AS

00:16:18.043 --> 00:16:19.144
PEOPLE APPEAR TO BE.

00:16:19.211 --> 00:16:20.879
PURSUING LAST HARVEST UNDER THE

00:16:20.946 --> 00:16:22.481
T. H. P..

00:16:22.548 --> 00:16:24.717
AND MORE ARE FOCUSED ON THE

00:16:24.783 --> 00:16:25.784
NOTICE OF EXEMPTIONS RELATED TO

00:16:25.851 --> 00:16:27.953
THE FARMERS.

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:29.722
ANOTHER REASON FOR A POTENTIAL

00:16:29.788 --> 00:16:30.756
SLIGHT INCREASE IN THE REVIEW

00:16:30.823 --> 00:16:32.391
TIME.

00:16:32.458 --> 00:16:33.559
IS.

00:16:33.625 --> 00:16:35.060
THE ADDITIONAL LISTING OF

00:16:35.127 --> 00:16:37.529
SPECIES WHICH REQUIRES MORE

00:16:37.596 --> 00:16:38.931
CONSULTATION MORE PAPERWORK.

00:16:38.997 --> 00:16:41.900
AS WELL AS POTENTIALLY.

00:16:41.967 --> 00:16:43.302
A MOMENTARY LOSS IN CRITICAL

00:16:43.369 --> 00:16:45.404
STAFFING AT CAL FIRE IN THE

00:16:45.471 --> 00:16:48.207
CENTER ROSE IN REDDING OFFICE.

00:16:48.273 --> 00:16:49.975
BUT I ALSO THINK YOU CAN LOOK AT

00:16:50.042 --> 00:16:52.177
THE DATA AND THE TWO THOUSAND

00:16:52.244 --> 00:16:52.845
SEVENTEEN REPORT.

00:16:52.911 --> 00:16:54.246
AND YOU CAN FIND TREND LINES

00:16:54.313 --> 00:16:56.048
THAT ARE SHOWING POSITIVE IF YOU

00:16:56.115 --> 00:16:58.751
THINK JUST ABOUT OUR DEPARTMENTS.

00:16:58.817 --> 00:17:01.086
PROCESSING WE ACTUALLY THINK ARE

00:17:01.153 --> 00:17:03.122
LAKE INSTREAM BAT ALTERATION

00:17:03.188 --> 00:17:04.423
WORKLOAD.

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:06.892
HAS INCREASED BUT THE PERMITTING

00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:07.960
TIMELINE TO DEAL WITH IT IS

00:17:08.026 --> 00:17:11.530
SHRINKING.

00:17:11.597 --> 00:17:12.831
SO MY MY VIEW IS WHEN YOU LOOK

00:17:12.898 --> 00:17:14.500
AT THE DATA YOU CAN FIND SOME

00:17:14.566 --> 00:17:17.002
TREND LINES WHICH ARE.

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:18.303
OF CONCERN THAT WE NEED TO DO

00:17:18.370 --> 00:17:20.305
BETTER AND I THINK YOU CAN FIND

00:17:20.372 --> 00:17:21.607
SOME TREND LINES THE SHOW THE

00:17:21.673 --> 00:17:23.542
FUNDING IS PRODUCING PERMIT

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:26.178
EFFICIENT [inaudible]

00:17:26.245 --> 00:17:28.080
AGAIN JUST.

00:17:28.147 --> 00:17:30.115
I KNOW WHERE WE ARE ALL TRYING

00:17:30.182 --> 00:17:33.252
TO ABSORB THIS -- AT THIS POINT --

00:17:33.318 --> 00:17:34.753
IN IN A LITTLE BIT OF A FIRE

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:35.354
HOUSE I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I

00:17:35.421 --> 00:17:36.755
AM READING CORRECTLY

00:17:36.822 --> 00:17:37.055
[inaudible]

00:17:37.122 --> 00:17:38.690
SO.

00:17:38.757 --> 00:17:41.193
ON THE TV FRONT.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:42.761
REVIEW TO PROVE 6% PURE CHEESE

00:17:42.828 --> 00:17:45.597
PEAS COVERING 32% CURE RATE.

00:17:45.664 --> 00:17:46.665
THE BIGGEST DRIVER FOR THAT

00:17:46.732 --> 00:17:46.965
[inaudible]

00:17:47.032 --> 00:17:48.667
IS.

00:17:48.734 --> 00:17:49.668
GOING THROUGH THE EXEMPTION

00:17:49.735 --> 00:17:52.204
PROCESS.

00:17:52.271 --> 00:17:54.006
YOU'RE NOT CHECK IN THAT JUST

00:17:54.072 --> 00:17:55.274
EXPLAIN IF YOU DON'T MIND TO

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:55.474
MEET.

00:17:55.541 --> 00:17:59.311
THE THAT THAT PROCESS I THE

00:17:59.378 --> 00:18:00.512
EXPEDITED SIDE [inaudible]

00:18:00.579 --> 00:18:02.247
SO.

00:18:02.314 --> 00:18:04.016
YOU HAVE BEEN GIVEN A SNAPSHOT

00:18:04.082 --> 00:18:05.751
METRIC WHICH I GET YOU TO SAID

00:18:05.818 --> 00:18:08.454
REVIEW APPROVE 6% FEWER TICKETS

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:08.687
PLEASE.

00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:10.722
WHY?

00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:11.290
YOU ARE T. H. BEES ARE BEING

00:18:11.356 --> 00:18:11.590
SUBMITTED.

00:18:11.657 --> 00:18:13.992
BECAUSE MORE PEOPLE ARE PURSUING

00:18:14.059 --> 00:18:16.962
A FOCUS ON THE EXEMPTION WORK.

00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:19.331
THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF THAT

00:18:19.398 --> 00:18:20.999
DATA SAID THEN.

00:18:21.066 --> 00:18:21.667
IN WALKED ME THROUGH THEN

00:18:21.733 --> 00:18:23.502
BECAUSE THEN WE SEEN.

00:18:23.569 --> 00:18:26.238
I'M JUST DOING THE MATH HERE BUT

00:18:26.305 --> 00:18:28.574
I THINK I I'M MONTHS LONGER

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.409
THOUGH TO BE A TO DO.

00:18:30.476 --> 00:18:33.145
THE TEACHER PEAS -- BUT THE

00:18:33.212 --> 00:18:34.179
TIMBER HARVEST PLANS HOW MUCH MY

00:18:34.246 --> 00:18:35.147
PIECES AND AGAIN NOT AT ALL

00:18:35.214 --> 00:18:37.816
TRYING TO BE DO I GOTCHA I I'M

00:18:37.883 --> 00:18:38.750
LITERALLY JUST.

00:18:38.817 --> 00:18:40.452
SINCE IT IMPACTS OBVIOUSLY THE

00:18:40.519 --> 00:18:41.854
NORTH COAST AND MISTER DIRECTOR

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:42.721
EVEN ACTIVELY ENGAGE IN THIS

00:18:42.788 --> 00:18:44.423
WHICH I'M GRATEFUL FOR IS JUST

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:44.923
TRYING TO GET A BETTER

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:46.024
UNDERSTANDING OF IF WE'RE

00:18:46.091 --> 00:18:47.559
LOOKING IN A MONTH LONGER IN

00:18:47.626 --> 00:18:48.794
REGARD TO TEACH BEES.

00:18:48.861 --> 00:18:50.395
YOUR CHEESE REASON ACRES COMING

00:18:50.462 --> 00:18:52.197
THROUGH IS TRYING TO RECONCILE

00:18:52.264 --> 00:18:53.832
THAT GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES OR

00:18:53.899 --> 00:18:55.701
THREE EXAMPLES OF WHY THE REVIEW

00:18:55.767 --> 00:19:01.039
TIME APPEARS TO INCREASE OKAY BY

00:19:01.106 --> 00:19:02.174
THE FIRST.

00:19:02.241 --> 00:19:03.742
YOU DO A TYPICALLY YOU DO A PRE

00:19:03.809 --> 00:19:06.378
HARVEST INSPECTION.

00:19:06.445 --> 00:19:08.347
IT RAN LIKE CRAZY THE HEAD

00:19:08.413 --> 00:19:09.715
SERIES ABOUT A DISTRICT RIVER

00:19:09.781 --> 00:19:10.916
EVENTS DURING THIS TIME FRAME

00:19:10.983 --> 00:19:11.416
PEOPLE COULDN'T GET OUT

00:19:11.483 --> 00:19:11.717
[inaudible]

00:19:11.783 --> 00:19:13.285
SECOND.

00:19:13.352 --> 00:19:14.686
IN SOME OF THESE AREAS WHERE WE

00:19:14.753 --> 00:19:15.754
NEED TO DO THE PRE HARVEST

00:19:15.821 --> 00:19:17.422
INSPECTION WHICH IS A MULTI

00:19:17.489 --> 00:19:19.258
DISCIPLINARY TEAM IS JUST NOT MY

00:19:19.324 --> 00:19:19.558
DEPARTMENT.

00:19:19.625 --> 00:19:20.926
NO.

00:19:20.993 --> 00:19:22.127
PREVENTED YOU FROM GETTING OUT

00:19:22.194 --> 00:19:23.529
EARLIER YOU HAD TO GET OUT LATER.

00:19:23.595 --> 00:19:25.063
THIRD AS I MENTIONED WE'VE HAD

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:27.866
SOME ADDITIONAL SPECIES LISTINGS.

00:19:27.933 --> 00:19:29.401
WHICH THEMSELVES CAN CAUSE

00:19:29.468 --> 00:19:30.936
ANOTHER LAYER REVIEW TO MAKE

00:19:31.003 --> 00:19:32.938
SURE YOU'RE DOING.

00:19:33.005 --> 00:19:33.872
YOUR PROCESSING WITH THE

00:19:33.939 --> 00:19:34.573
ENVIRONMENTAL VALUES

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.375
CONSISTENTLY.

00:19:36.441 --> 00:19:38.243
BUT THESE ARE FOURTEEN NINETY

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:40.212
TWO ISSUES AND WHILE I REALIZE

00:19:40.279 --> 00:19:41.013
YOU DON'T HAVE THE MOST CURRENT

00:19:41.079 --> 00:19:42.548
POOR.

00:19:42.614 --> 00:19:44.449
IN MY PERSONAL VIEW THESE ARE

00:19:44.516 --> 00:19:46.785
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE NEXT REPORT

00:19:46.852 --> 00:19:50.055
I CAN COMMIT [inaudible] TO

00:19:50.122 --> 00:19:52.090
COMING AND DISCUSSING THAT

00:19:52.157 --> 00:19:55.027
REPORT WHEN AGENCY RELEASES IT.

00:19:55.093 --> 00:19:58.063
I SEE ASEPARATION BETWEEN THESE

00:19:58.130 --> 00:19:58.497
QUESTIONS.

00:19:58.564 --> 00:19:59.431
ENDED LATE.

00:19:59.498 --> 00:20:00.866
AND SENATE BILL NINE OH ONE

00:20:00.933 --> 00:20:02.034
FUNDING.

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.202
WHICH IS ASKING OUR DEPARTMENT

00:20:04.269 --> 00:20:07.806
GO DO NEW WORK AROUND CAT AS FAR

00:20:07.873 --> 00:20:09.541
AS TRAFFIC PIRATES.

00:20:09.608 --> 00:20:11.276
BROUGH THE EXEMPTIONS AND THAT'S

00:20:11.343 --> 00:20:13.211
ALL OUR PROPOSAL IS SEEKING IT

00:20:13.278 --> 00:20:14.713
WHAT I WAS TAKING A LEASE THAT I

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:15.881
UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS

00:20:15.948 --> 00:20:18.317
THAT YOU ARE WORKING ON BEING TO

00:20:18.383 --> 00:20:20.085
GET IT DONE AND WHAT.

00:20:20.152 --> 00:20:20.752
OUR UNDERSTANDING LEASE ARE MADE

00:20:20.819 --> 00:20:22.554
OUT TO SPEAK FOR MYSELF IS THAT

00:20:22.621 --> 00:20:23.221
WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO SEE THAT

00:20:23.288 --> 00:20:25.691
BECAUSE WHILE THEY MAY BE TWO

00:20:25.757 --> 00:20:26.792
SEPARATE FUND SOURCES AND

00:20:26.858 --> 00:20:27.125
INITIATIVES.

00:20:27.192 --> 00:20:30.562
IT ALL IS SOMEWHAT RELATED SO I

00:20:30.629 --> 00:20:32.598
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HAVING THIS

00:20:32.664 --> 00:20:36.468
CONVERSATION HERE TODAY -- THE

00:20:36.535 --> 00:20:37.669
BIGGEST CHALLENGE IN REGARD TO

00:20:37.736 --> 00:20:39.738
THE DIGITAL THIRTY DAYS IS

00:20:39.805 --> 00:20:42.274
WEATHER RELATED AND STAFFING.

00:20:42.341 --> 00:20:43.809
IN IN THAT SO EVERY SOARING IN

00:20:43.875 --> 00:20:45.777
THE REPORT YOU ANTICIPATE THE IS

00:20:45.844 --> 00:20:46.878
AS IT'S BEEN A GRADUAL TREND

00:20:46.945 --> 00:20:48.213
FROM ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS A

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.449
HUNDRED AND FORTY AS A BEEN A

00:20:50.515 --> 00:20:52.050
TWELVE MONTH -- OR IS THIS

00:20:52.117 --> 00:20:53.919
SOMETHING IN ALL OF THE TO THE

00:20:53.986 --> 00:20:55.253
CHAIR AND THIS LED TO BE RAGING

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:56.221
DISS TO BUILD HAVE A FURTHER

00:20:56.288 --> 00:20:57.823
CONVERSATION BECAUSE I DO THINK

00:20:57.889 --> 00:20:58.790
IT'S IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY SINCE.

00:20:58.857 --> 00:21:01.627
TAKING IN THE GAME IS COMING ON

00:21:01.693 --> 00:21:02.427
THE INDUSTRY SIDE OF JUST.

00:21:02.494 --> 00:21:04.162
WHERE WE'RE AT ON THAT BUT I I'M

00:21:04.229 --> 00:21:05.430

AB ONE SECOND.

00:21:14.673 --> 00:21:17.075
LOOK I I DO THINK THAT THE THE

00:21:17.142 --> 00:21:19.678
T. H. P. REVIEW TIME.

00:21:19.745 --> 00:21:22.547
UNDER THE FOUR YEARS I THINK

00:21:22.614 --> 00:21:24.683
IT'S BEEN A FOURTEEN NINETY TWO

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:25.684
HAS SHRUNK AND THEN GONE UP MOST

00:21:25.751 --> 00:21:27.819
RECENTLY IT'S PLATEAUED AND IT

00:21:27.886 --> 00:21:30.489
MAY ACTUALLY GO UP AGAIN WHEN WE

00:21:30.555 --> 00:21:31.923
LOOK AT THE COP COMING REPORT.

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:33.325
AND THAT'S OF CONCERN.

00:21:33.392 --> 00:21:35.227
WE SHOULD A PRETTY OPEN

00:21:35.293 --> 00:21:35.994
CONVERSATION ABOUT.

00:21:36.061 --> 00:21:37.162
BUT I'M NOT THE CONTROLLER OF

00:21:37.229 --> 00:21:39.031
THE REPORT.

00:21:39.097 --> 00:21:41.366
AGENCY IS THE CONTROLLER OF THE

00:21:41.433 --> 00:21:41.700
REPORT.

00:21:41.767 --> 00:21:44.302
WE HAVE A PROPOSAL ABOUT SENATE

00:21:44.369 --> 00:21:46.371
BILL. NINE ONE FOR CATASTROPHIC

00:21:46.438 --> 00:21:49.941

ANY ITEMS YOU'D LIKE TO BE A

00:21:50.575 --> 00:21:52.644
CONCERN.

00:21:52.711 --> 00:21:54.479
THANKS BRIAN CASH FROM THE

00:21:54.546 --> 00:21:55.781
NATURAL RESOURCES IN C. LIKE THE

00:21:55.847 --> 00:21:56.815

LEADERSHIP FOR FOURTEEN NINETY

00:21:59.317 --> 00:22:01.186
TWO AT THE AGENCY AND THEY ARE

00:22:01.253 --> 00:22:02.921
REVIEWING THE REPORT RIGHT NOW

00:22:02.988 --> 00:22:03.889
AND THEY WILL BE.

00:22:03.955 --> 00:22:05.524
IN THERE DOING A DEEP DIVE INTO

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:06.825
ACTUALLY EACH DEPARTMET HOW

00:22:06.892 --> 00:22:08.593
MUCH FUNDING EACH DEPARTMENT HAS

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:11.163
WHAT THEY'RE DOING FOR WITH AB

00:22:11.229 --> 00:22:12.130
FOURTEEN NINETY TWO AND TRYING

00:22:12.197 --> 00:22:13.331
TO FIND EFFICIENCIES.

00:22:13.398 --> 00:22:16.301
SO UNDER THAT NEW LEADERSHIP

00:22:16.368 --> 00:22:17.536
THERE'S GOING TO BE.

00:22:17.602 --> 00:22:18.103
I WOULDN'T SAY MISSION BASED

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:19.304
REVIEW BUT SOMETHING SIMILAR TO

00:22:19.371 --> 00:22:20.338
WHERE WE'RE REALLY TAKING DOWN

00:22:20.405 --> 00:22:22.340
AND TRYING TO FIND EFFICIENCIES

00:22:22.407 --> 00:22:24.209
AND MAK THIS IS.

00:22:24.276 --> 00:22:24.743
MAKE THIS IS A FASHION AS

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:26.344
POSSIBLE.

00:22:26.411 --> 00:22:27.846
IN INTO WHEN YOU ANTICIPATE THAT

00:22:27.913 --> 00:22:28.947
THE LEGISLATURE WOULD BE A

00:22:29.014 --> 00:22:30.582
RECEIVE A COPY OF THAT REPORT.

00:22:30.649 --> 00:22:31.950
WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON IT AS

00:22:32.017 --> 00:22:34.152
QUICKLY AS HE CAN -- I I WOULD

00:22:34.219 --> 00:22:37.622
SAY WITHIN THE NEXT MONTH.

00:22:37.689 --> 00:22:39.658
CONSIDER SOME OF THE SNAPSHOTS I

00:22:39.725 --> 00:22:41.493
THINK WE SHOULD.

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.462
OUR STAFF SHARED WITH YOUR STAFF

00:22:43.528 --> 00:22:45.764
INCLUDE.

00:22:45.831 --> 00:22:47.666
THE LIKELY METRICS THAT THERE IS

00:22:47.733 --> 00:22:49.534
ACTUALLY SHIFT BACK TO A GREATER

00:22:49.601 --> 00:22:51.870
NUMBER OF T. H. HE'S.

00:22:51.937 --> 00:22:53.338
IN THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN PERIOD

00:22:53.405 --> 00:22:54.740
WHICH MEANS A CORRESPONDING

00:22:54.806 --> 00:22:56.775
INCREASE IN THE AREA.

00:22:56.842 --> 00:22:58.810
OF LAND UNDER THE T. H. IS.

00:22:58.877 --> 00:23:00.412
THAT ALSO SAY.

00:23:00.479 --> 00:23:02.380
SOME REASONS POTENTIALLY FOR THE

00:23:02.447 --> 00:23:05.350
REVIEW TIME BUMPING UP.

00:23:05.417 --> 00:23:07.486
ALSO INCLUDE.

00:23:07.552 --> 00:23:08.754
SOME OF THE T. H. BEES WERE

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:10.922
CONVERSION T. AGENCIES WHICH

00:23:10.989 --> 00:23:12.424
TEND TO BE PRETTY CONTROVERSY.

00:23:12.491 --> 00:23:13.825
THE REQUIREMENT BY MIDDLE IMPACT

00:23:13.892 --> 00:23:16.361
REPORT CERTIFIED BY THE LOCAL

00:23:16.428 --> 00:23:17.796
GOVERNMENT THAT'S INVOLVED.

00:23:17.863 --> 00:23:19.931
AND I THINK WE'VE HAD INSTANCES

00:23:19.998 --> 00:23:21.133
IN THIS LAST COUPLE OF YEARS

00:23:21.199 --> 00:23:22.534
WHERE THE T. H. P. IS THAT

00:23:22.601 --> 00:23:23.535
ORIGINALLY FILED BY THE

00:23:23.602 --> 00:23:25.337
SUBMITTER.

00:23:25.403 --> 00:23:27.339
HAVE BEEN WITHDRAWN BECAUSE THEY

00:23:27.405 --> 00:23:29.040
WANT TO GO FOCUS ON THE DROUGHT

00:23:29.107 --> 00:23:30.609
MORTALITY EXEMPTIONS.

00:23:30.675 --> 00:23:32.010
AND THEN WHEN THEY COME BACK TO

00:23:32.077 --> 00:23:33.078
THE TIMBER PLAN THEY'VE GOT

00:23:33.145 --> 00:23:34.746
SIGNIFICANT REVISIONS BECAUSE

00:23:34.813 --> 00:23:36.414
TIME IS PAST WHAT WHAT I'LL SAY

00:23:36.481 --> 00:23:38.150
IS A AND AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE

00:23:38.216 --> 00:23:39.518
DIRECTOR LOOK.

00:23:39.584 --> 00:23:41.153
NOT AT ALL TRYING.

00:23:41.219 --> 00:23:42.387

ON AN ITEM THAT WE SAID WE WOULD.

00:23:45.423 --> 00:23:48.627

00:23:52.531 --> 00:23:54.599

00:23:54.666 --> 00:23:55.467
ITEMS IN.

00:23:55.534 --> 00:23:56.868
WE'RE UNABLE TO DO A DEEP DIVE

00:23:56.935 --> 00:23:57.803
AT THIS POINT BECAUSE WE ARE THE

00:23:57.869 --> 00:23:58.870
FORMER IMPORTANT FRONT OF US.

00:23:58.937 --> 00:24:00.705

THE FORESTRY ASSOCIATION WAS

00:25:24.923 --> 00:25:26.157
ACTIVE IN.

00:25:26.224 --> 00:25:27.993
AB FOURTEEN NINETY TWO BACK

00:25:42.807 --> 00:25:44.376
AB.

00:25:44.442 --> 00:25:45.844
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TWO THINGS

00:25:45.911 --> 00:25:48.647
FIRST ABOUT THIS SPECIFIC BUDGET

00:25:48.713 --> 00:25:50.482
CHANGE PROPOSAL -- THE DIRECTOR

00:25:50.548 --> 00:25:53.084
IS ASKING FOR FUNDS. TO HIRE

00:25:53.151 --> 00:25:56.621
STAFF TO MONITOR EXEMPTIONS TO

TIMBER HARVEST PLANTS.

00:25:58.456 --> 00:26:00.926
WE BELIEVE THAT EXEMPTIONS TO

00:26:00.992 --> 00:26:01.526
TIMBER HARVEST PLAN SHOULD BE

00:26:01.593 --> 00:26:02.794
MONITORED.

00:26:02.861 --> 00:26:03.795
I WE WANT THAT KIND OF

00:26:03.862 --> 00:26:05.730
ACCOUNTABILITY.

00:26:05.797 --> 00:26:08.099
WHETHER -- FIFTEEN POSITION IS

00:26:08.166 --> 00:26:09.768
CORRECT WE DON'T.

00:26:09.834 --> 00:26:12.137
KNOW.

00:26:12.203 --> 00:26:12.904
HIS JUDGMENT IN TANDEM A GUY

00:26:12.971 --> 00:26:15.573
WILL ACCEPT THAT.

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.542
WHAT WE DO HAVE CONCERN ABOUT IS

00:26:17.609 --> 00:26:18.777
POTENTIALLY THE SOURCE OF THESE

00:26:18.843 --> 00:26:19.978
FUNDS COMING OUT OF THE TIMBER

00:26:20.045 --> 00:26:21.713
TAX?

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:23.748
AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T

00:26:23.815 --> 00:26:24.883
SEEN THE REPORT.

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:26.685
IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS SINCE WE HAD

00:26:26.751 --> 00:26:29.087
A REPORT OF FROM -- THE

00:26:29.154 --> 00:26:31.389

REGULATION AND FORCE RESTORATION

00:26:36.394 --> 00:26:37.862
PROGRAM.

00:26:37.929 --> 00:26:40.165
WITHOUT THAT REPORT AS WE ONLY

00:26:40.231 --> 00:26:41.933
HAVE ANECDOTAL INFORMATION ABOUT

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:42.867
WHETHER ACTUALLY ACHIEVING THE

00:26:42.934 --> 00:26:45.303
GOALS ORIGINALLY IN.

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:46.371
FOURTEEN NINETY TWO OF REDUCING

00:26:46.438 --> 00:26:47.572
THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES TO

00:26:47.639 --> 00:26:51.009
PROCESS THE TIMBER HARVEST PLAN.

00:26:51.076 --> 00:26:52.377
MORE IMPORTANTLY WE ALSO DON'T

00:26:52.444 --> 00:26:54.746
KNOW THE STATUS OF THE FUND.

00:26:54.813 --> 00:26:56.648
IN OUR PROJECTIONS ARE THAT THE

00:26:56.715 --> 00:27:00.218
FUND IS HEADED TOWARDS A DEFICIT.

00:27:00.285 --> 00:27:03.188
IN A ADDITIONAL POSITIONS FROM

00:27:03.254 --> 00:27:04.589
THE FUND AT THIS POINT.

00:27:04.656 --> 00:27:07.258
COULD MAKE THAT DEFICIT.

00:27:07.325 --> 00:27:08.727
OCCUR FASTER.

00:27:08.793 --> 00:27:09.861
WE'RE NOT THERE YET AND SO THEY

00:27:09.928 --> 00:27:11.963
PROBABLY FUNDING TO TO PAY FOR

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:13.231
THESE POSITIONS THIS YEAR.

00:27:13.298 --> 00:27:15.867
BUT WE ARE HEADING TO A POSITION

00:27:15.934 --> 00:27:16.634
WHERE THERE WILL BE SOME

00:27:16.701 --> 00:27:18.370
BRINKMANSHIP AROUND HOW WE

00:27:18.436 --> 00:27:20.905
MANAGE OUR TIMBER HARVEST PLANTS.

00:27:26.044 --> 00:27:27.078
AND DO THAT IN A WAY THAT.

00:27:27.145 --> 00:27:29.881
HOLDS TRUE TO WHAT WAS THE

00:27:29.948 --> 00:27:31.149
ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE
