WE CAN TELL ABOUT THE MOVIE. FOR THAT WE HAVE OF FILE ITEM NUMBER THREE AB TWENTY NINE SIXTY SEVEN GIORDANO WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS- SENATE AMENDMENTS CLARIFY. A TO THIS BILL- CLARIFY THAT A PUBLIC AGENCY MAY NOT AMEND ITS CONTRACT WITH CALPERS TO EXCLUDE GROUPS OF EMPLOYEES THAT ERE PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED. SEVERAL SERVICES SERVING THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA CONTRIBUTE A PORTION OF THEIR EARNINGS TO THEIR CALPERS PENSIONS. TRUSTING THEIR INVESTMENT WILL PROVIDE A SECURE RETIREMENT. MANY OF THOSE EMPLOYEES INCLUDING FIREFIGHTERS PERFORM CHANGERS AND DEMANDING JOBS CONFIDENT THAT THEIR PENSION BENEFITS WILL ENSURE A SECOND A SECURE FUTURE FOR THEIR FAMILIES. SOME LOCAL AGENCIES HAVE DECIDED TO GAMBLE ON A RISKY MODEL THAT THE PRICE PUBLIC EMPLOYEES OF A SECURE RETIREMENT. BY AMENDING THEIR CONTRACTS TO EXCLUDE CERTAIN GROUPS OF EMPLOYEES FROM CALPERS BENEFITS. LIMITING ACCESS TO CALPERS ROB CRITICAL PUBLIC SAFETY WORKERS OF THE PENSION BENEFITS AND FINANCIAL SECURITY THEY DESERVE. ADDITIONALLY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF AGENCIES ADOPT THIS MODEL THE LOSS OF CONTRIBUTIONS TO CALPERS COULD DESTABILIZE THE FUN AND ENDANGER THE RETIREMENT BENEFITS OF ALL PUBLIC EMPLOYEES. AB TWENTY NINE SIXTY SEVEN. TO ENSURE PUBLIC AGENCIES USE THE CALPERS AMENDMENT PROCESS AS INTENDED NOT TO CUT OUT SELECT GROUPS OF EMPLOYEES FROM A SECURE RETIREMENT. DOT TESTIFYING MAYBE ON THE BILL IS CHRISTY BOWMAN REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS I DON'T KNOW IF SHE'S AVAILABLE ON THE PHONE MISTER CHAIR.

THANK YOU OPERATOR ANYBODY ELSE IN THE QUEUE. NO I DON'T THINK HE'LL. GOVERNOR TO GO THROUGH THOSE ON THE PHONE IN OPPOSITION OPERATORS WORK THROUGH THE QUEUE FOR THOSE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL AGAIN WE'RE HEARING FROM THE OPPOSITION ON AB. TWENTY NINE SIXTY SEVEN. ONE MOMENT WHILE WE COLLECT ONLINE NUMBER. AT NINE TWENTY SIX YOUR LINE IS OPEN. I TWENTY SIX YOUR LINE IS OPEN. MEMBERS THIS IS DYLAN GIVENS WITH THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION CALLING OPPOSITION AB TWENTY NINE SIXTY SEVEN I WILL TRY TO KEEP THIS BRIEF FAMILIAR IMAGES TRYING TO WRAP UP EXTRA QUICKLY. I WOULD LIKE TO START BY SAYING THAT THAT CITIES ALONG RECORD OF TO FIND. CONTRIBUTIONS AS A WAY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN EMPLOYEES AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO- ARE OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY NINE FIFTY SEVEN BASED ON THE UNDERSTANDING PUBLIC AGENCIES HAVE A DUTY TO RESPONSIBLY MANAGE PUBLIC FINANCES. IN A PUBLIC AGENCY DETERMINES THAT DEFINED. BENEFIT PENSIONS BUT SOMETHING THEY CANNOT OF. TO RETAIN THE OF WITH CAL. AND THERE AND TO MANAGE THOSE COSTS ON A CASE BY BASIS. CURRENTLY THE PUBLICLY IT IS DETERMINES THAT CA NO LONGER AFFORD BY BENEFIT CONTRIBUTIONS. I WOULD LIKE TO SET UP FOR A POOR ONE CUT STYLE PLAN. THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO EITHER LEAVE THE SYSTEM ENTIRELY OR AMENDED CONTRACT WITH CALPERS WHICH CALPERS HAS TO APPROVE IF THEY BELIEVE IN IT WOULD DESTABILIZE THE FUND THEY WANT TO PROVE IT. THEN THEY CAN REMOVE CERTAIN CLASSIFICATIONS OF EMPLOYEES FROM THE PENSION CONTRACT WITH CALPERS OR IN THE CASE OF PLACENTIA- REMOVE THE CLASSIFICATION PLEASE WITH NO ACTIVE EMPLOYEES UNDER CONTRACT AND THEN HIRE EMPLOYEES AND THE CLASSIFICATION UNDER DIFFERENT PLANTS- WHAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL TO ADDRESS OUR PENSION COSTS. THE BILL TAKES A TOOL AWAY BY STATING THAT BY SAYING IT'S ALL OR NOTHING. WHETHER PROVIDED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION TO ALL EMPLOYEES OR NOT. UNFORTUNATELY BUT THE DRAMATIC INCREASE IN PENSION COSTS THAT WE'VE BEEN EXPERIENCING THAT MAY RESULT AT THAT MAY RESULT IN MORE EMPLOYEES WITHOUT DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION. RATHER THAN LET IT THIS BILL SEEKS. NO TO THAT PUBLIC AGENCIES EXACT SAME GET THIS BILL TO TAKE THE ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH BY LIMITING REALLY USED TO. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF OUR POSITION. AND I ASK FOR YOU KNOW ABOUT. THANK YOU OP CENTER ELSE IN THE- WE HAVE BLIND SIX BUT NOT THAT ONE NO THEY'RE GONNA KILL AT THE TIME. OKAY SEEN THERE'S NO ONE ELSE IN THE QUEUE WE'LL GO TO THE VIDEO REMOTE STATIONS DO WE HAVE. ANY WITNESSES THAT WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT OPPOSITION TESTIMONY. IF SO PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME ORGANIZATION OF ANY POSITION ON THE BILL ENDING BRIEF COMMENTS. SEE NON NOW LET'S GO TO WITNESSES HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM. TO HAVE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION IF SO PLEASE COME FOR TO THE MICROPHONE AND WITHOUT. TOUCHING PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME ORGANIZATION OF ANY POSITION ON THE BILL ON A BRIEF COMMENTS. SAY NONE. A BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. ANY TWENTY QUESTIONS COME OUT OF. WE HAVE A MOTION MISTER COOPER AND SECONDED BY SUMMER COOLEY. A SOME REFLECT CLOSE- YES THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AND I THINK THE GENTLEMAN FROM THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION MADE MY POINT- WHAT HE REALLY ARTICULATED WAS THAT THEY DON'T DESIRE TO OFFER A PENSION PLAN. AND WHAT WE'RE SEEKING HERE TO DO IS TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE ARE PROMISED A PENSION OR- HAVE A JOB THAT MISSISSIPPI TO PENSION BECAUSE THE DAY THAT THE DANGEROUS NATURE OF THE JOB I GET THAT PENSION WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO SEE IN CALIFORNIA IS THAT SUB GOVERNMENT START POPPING UP. AND UNDER THAT WERE MAYBE FORMALLY SPECIAL DISTRICTS CENTER AND OFFERING AND NOT OFFERING PENSION PLANS IT'S ACTUALLY TRYING TO DITCH THAT PENSION PLAN AND GET AROUND- THE LEGAL OBLIGATION ARGUABLY SO WITH THAT I JUST ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FUTURE. THANK WITHOUT. AWESOME REMOTE HONORABLY THIS BILL CLOSES THE LOOPHOLE THAT PREVENTS THE INAPPROPRIATE USE OF THE CALPERS AGENCY. CONTRACTING PROCESS IN THE FUTURE TO EXCLUDE PUBLIC EMPLOYEES FROM A DEFINED BENEFIT RETIREMENT.
