MINORS ARE PROHIBITED FROM GAINING OR PURCHASING TOBACCO PRODUCTS IN THE TRIBE'S ALCOHOL SALES AND PURCHASES WILL COMPLY WITH STATE LAWS CONSISTENT WITH OTHER RECENT CONTACTS THESE CONTACTS ARE SUPPORTIVE OF TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY BY INCORPORATING RATHER THAN DIRECTING TRIBAL LAW. THE CONTACTS FOR EXAMPLE INCLUDE TRIBAL ORDINANCES FOR PAGER DISPUTES COURTS AND EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION WITH AGREEABLE DUE PROCESS PROVISIONS ADDITIONALLY THE TRIBE'S COMMIT TO MINIMUM WAGE STANDARDS AT LEAST AS STRINGENT AS CALIFORNIANS BOTH CONTRACTS REQUIRE THE TRIBES TO MAINTAIN A TRIBAL LABOR RELATIONS ORDINANCE FOR T.

IF BEST EFFORTS BY THE TRIBE IN THE STATE TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE THROUGH GOOD FAITH NEGOTIATIONS DID NOT SUCCEED.

AT THE DISTRICT COURT LEVEL THE COURT FOUND THAT UNITE HERE IN SIX ONE HAD FORMED A CONTRACT. REQUIRING COMPLIANCE WITH THE T. L. R. O. IN ORDER THE PARTY STARTED STRAIGHT. SICK ONES APPEAL BACK TO THE NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS. LAST I KNOW THEY'RE NICE CIRCUIT HAS NOT YET SCHEDULED ORAL ARGUMENT IN THE CASE I THINK PEOPLE ARE EXPECTING IT MAYBE AROUND THE END OF THIS YEAR BEGINNING OF MAX- BUT NO TIMELINE SPECIFICALLY ON A DECISION FOR THATCASE.

YES THANK YOU- GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN DIED AND MEMBERS GOOD MORNING TO GERMAN CISCO CHAIRMAN SIMON AND MR UGLY OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE MY NAME IS MARIO YOU DID YEAH AND ON THE WESTERN POLITICAL DIRECTOR WITH UNITE HERE. INTERNATIONAL UNION THE CASINO WORKERS UNION IN NORTH AMERICA. OUR MEMBERS ARE OVERWHELMINGLY PEOPLE OF COLOR IMMIGRANTS AND WOMEN AND IN CALIFORNIA WERE PROUD THAT SEVEN THOUSAND OF OUR MEMBERS WORKING. NINE TRIBAL CASINOS ACROSS THE STATE WHERE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS ENSURE DIGNITY RESPECT AND FAIR WAGES AND BENEFITS. UNITE HERE HAS NOT OPPOSED TO CONTACT IN THE LEGISLATURE FOR MORE THAN FORTY YEARS. WE HAVE NOT DONE SO BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT THE TRIBAL LABOR RELATIONS ORDINANCES INCORPORATED INTO CONTACTS SINCE THEN HAVE PROTECTED WORKERS ABILITY TO FREELY ASSOCIATE AND ORGANIZE AND WE DO NOT STAND BEFORE YOU THIS MORNING IN OPPOSITION TO EITHER THE SANTA ROSA NOR THE MIDDLETOWN RANCHERIA COMPACTS. HOWEVER WE MUST EXPRESS SIGNIFICANT CONCERN ABOUT THE STATUS OF CASINO WORKER RIGHTS IN CALIFORNIA. FOR THREE REASONS MOST FUNDAMENTALLY WERE WORRIED ABOUT THE STATE'S ENFORCEMENT OF ALL TRIBAL LABOR RELATIONS ORDINANCE SAYS IN LIGHT OF THE ACTIONS OF MANAGEMENT THAT'S A QANTAS YOU KNOW RESORT IN SAN DIEGO SOMETHING WHICH CHAIRMAN DIED. AND MR BOLDLY MADE MENTION OF EARLIER IN THIS HEARING THE FACT IS THAT THE SYCUAN BAND OF THE KUMEYAAY NATION HAS BEEN OPENLY FLOUTING THE TRIBAL LABOR RELATIONS ORDINANCE IN THEIR CONTACT AT THAT THIS YOU KNOW FOR CLOSE TO TWO YEARS. WORKERS AT SAQUON HELD THEIR FIRST COMMITTEE MEETING IN THE SUMMER OF TWENTY NINETEEN AND THEY ASKED THE TRIBE TO HONOR THE T. L. R. O. IN NOVEMBER OF THAT YEAR. BUT SAQUON TURNED AROUND. AND THEY STARTED UNION BUSTING THEY BROUGHT AN ANTI UNION CONSULTANTS AND FORCE THE WORKERS INTO MEETINGS TO BAD MOUTH THE UNION THEN THEY TURNED AROUND AND JUST ABOUT THE T. L. R. O. AS SUCH AND THEY HAVEN'T STOPPED. DESPITE THE FACT THAT ON DECEMBER TENTH TWENTY TWENTY U. S. DISTRICT COURT FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ORDERED SAQUON TO ARBITRATE ITS DISPUTE WITH THE UNION. THE TRIBE CONTINUES TO DRAG ITS FEET AND REFUSES TO ARBITRATE. SO KWAN APPEALED AND THAT CASE IS PENDING BEFORE THE NINTH CIRCUIT WHAT'S MORE. ELEVEN TRIBES HAVE BROUGHT SUIT AGAINST THE STATE. ARGUING AGAINST THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE T. L. R. O. AS A SUBJECT OF COMPACT NEGOTIATIONS. THOSE CASES ARE ALSO PENDING IN FEDERAL COURT. AND FINALLY WE MUST NOTE THAT JUST LAST MONTH FOR THE THIRD TIME IN FIVE YEARS. THE TRIBAL LABOR SOVEREIGNTY ACT A BILL THAT WOULD EXEMPT TRIBAL CASINOS FROM THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT. WAS PUT FORWARD IN CONGRESS. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE SAME BILL PASSED THE HOUSE AND CAME A FEW VOTES SHY OF PASSAGE IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. THIS MEANS THAT WHILE IN CONGRESS NUMEROUS TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS ARE ATTEMPTING TO EXEMPT THEMSELVES FROM FEDERAL LABOR LAW AT THE SAME TIME IN CALIFORNIA. A DOZEN TRIBES ARE ATTEMPTING TO GET AROUND THE LABOR PROTECTIONS INCORPORATED INTO TRIBAL STATE COMPACTS. UNITE HERE RECOGNIZES AND AFFIRMS THE RIGHT OF TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY. WE WELL KNOW THAT THE SANTA ROSA INDIAN COMMUNITY AND GERMAN CISCO. AND THE MIDDLETOWN RANCHERIA CHAIRMAN SIMON DO NOT RUN SAQUON CASINO RESORT AND THEY ARE NOT PARTIES TO THE LAWSUIT SEEKING TO DISALLOW LABOR RIGHTS. FROM BEING A SUBJECT OF TRIBAL STATE COMPACT IN CALIFORNIA. WE DO KNOW THAT THE MIDDLETOWN RANCHERIA IS A MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL INDIAN GAMING ASSOCIATION. WHICH IN ITS OWN WORDS PRIORITIZED AND DEVOTED SIGNIFICANT EFFORT. TO PASS THE TRIBAL LABOR SOVEREIGNTY ACT WHAT ALSO RECOGNIZE INDUSTRIAL PATTERNS AND WE AFFIRM THE RIGHT OF WORKERS TO FREELY ASSOCIATE UNTIL MORGAN EYES THEMSELVES INTO A UNION IF THEY SO CHOOSE. CALIFORNIA TRIBAL GAMING IS A NINE BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY WHERE NO LESS THAN A DOZEN EMPLOYERS ARE SEEKING TO ELIMINATE. TRIBAL STATE COMPACT ENSHRINED LABOR RIGHTS WELL AT THE SAME TIME THE INDUSTRY'S CORE NATIONAL TRADE ASSOCIATION. SEEKS TO UNDO THE SAME RIGHTS FEDERALLY. FOR THE RECORD WE REGISTER OUR CONCERN WITH THE STATUS YOU KNOW WORKER ORGANIZING RIGHTS. AND WE ASKED THE COMMITTEE TO TAKE NOTE OF THESE FACTS MISS MARTIN. GOOD MORNING EVERYONE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU HI MY NAME IS KRISTEN MARTIN-I'M WITH THE LAW FIRM OF THE CRACK IN GOVERNMENT IN SALISBURY AND I'M GENERAL COUNSEL TO UNITE HERE INTERNATIONAL UNION THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION GIVES THE LEGISLATURE AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN DECIDING THE TERMS OF TRIBAL GAMING COMPACTS. ARTICLE FOUR SECTION NINETEEN ACCESS OF THE GOVERNOR YOU GO SHOOTING CONCLUDES COMPAQ'S BUT THOSE CONTACTS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RATIFICATION OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THIS FORMULA THE LEGISLATURE IS NOT A RUBBER STAMP THE LEGISLATURE'S JOB IS TO CAREFULLY REVIEW AND CONSIDER ALL PROVISIONS OF A PROPOSED COMPACT JUST AS IT WOULD O WITH ANY OTHER BILL THAT COMES BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE AND THE LEGISLATURE CAN DEFINE DEFINE EXCUSE ME TO RATIFY A CONTRACT CONTACT IF IT'S NOT SATISFIED WITH THE PROPOSED TERMS SOME HAVE POINTED OUT THAT THE INDIAN GAMING REGULATORY ACT PERMITS TRIBES TO SUE THE STATE FOR NEGOTIATING IN BAD FAITH. WHAT DID IT MEAN GAMING REGULATORY ACT ACTUALLY SAYS IS THAT A TRY MISSOURI STATE FOR FAILING TO RESPOND TO THE TRIBE'S REQUEST TO NEGOTIATE A CONTRACT IN GOOD FAITH THE LEGISLATURE DOES NOT. FAIL TO RESPOND TO REQUESTSTO NEGOTIATE A CONTRACT IN GOOD FAITH. WHEN THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDERS THE TERMS OF THE PROPOSED COMPACT RESENTED YOUR RATIFICATION THE LEGISLATURE I WOULD SUBMIT MUST CONSIDER THAT WHETHER THE TERMS ARE FAIR. ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE INDIAN GAMING REGULATORY ACT AND WILL SERVE CALIFORNIA'S LEGITIMATE INTERESTS I'M IN THE LEGISLATURE DOES THIS IT ACTS IN GOOD FAITH IT EXERCISES ITS CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO RATIFY A CALL I WOULD ARGUE IT CAN NOT BE BAD FAITH TO DO WHAT THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION SAYS THAT THE LEGISLATURE MUST YOU. MISTER YOU DID HEAR REFERENCED THE CHALLENGES WE FACE WITH SUPPOSED TO CLIMB DOWN. LET ME LET ME JUST ADD A LITTLE BIT TO WHAT HE SAYS FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS THE SYCUAN BAND HAS VIOLATED LABOR RELATIONS PROVISIONS OF ITS CONTRACT WITH CALIFORNIA AND THERE'S NO GENUINE DISPUTE ABOUT THIS WHATSOEVER. THE COMPACT REQUIRES TO BOND TO ADOPT AND MAINTAIN THE TRIBAL LABOR RELATIONS WORK AND THAT TRIBAL LABOR RELATIONS ORDINANCE SAYS THAT IF THE UNION MAKES A SERIES OF PROMISES JUST ONE THE BENEFIT THAT FIVE MINUTES IS ENOUGH THOMAS IS NOT TO STRIKE NOT THE TICKET NOT TO BOYCOTT NOT THE POPE WHAT ARE CALLED ATTACK WEBSITES. NOT EVEN DISPARAGE THE TRIBE THE PURPOSE OF ORGANIZING AND NOT TO INTERFERE IN TRIBAL GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS THE BROAD RESTRICTIONS ON THE UNION'S RIGHT OF FREE SPEECH AND THE UNIONS AND THE LABOR RIGHTS OF THE EMPLOYEES THE UNION MAKES THOSE PROMISES SAID MON MON REMAIN NEUTRAL AND ALLOW WORKERS TO ORGANIZE A UNION WITHOUT INTERFERENCE IN OCTOBER TWENTY NINETEEN UNITE HERE LOCAL THIRTY WHICH OPERATES IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY MADE THOSE BOXES THE CROWD RESPONDED THAT THE COMPACT LABOR RELATIONS PROVISIONS ARE INVALID NOW THAT THEPUBLIC RELATIONS ORDINANCE ALLOWS THE UNION TO ENFORCE THE DEALERS TERMS THROUGH ARBITRATION THE LOCAL THIRTY ASK ONE CARPENTRY AND UPON REVIEW SO NOT ONLY REFUSED TO COMPLY WITH THE SUBSTANTIVE PROVISIONS OF THE TRIBAL LABOR RELATIONS ORDINANCE BUT IT ALSO REFUSED TO. USE THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS IN THAT ORDINANCE. IN A NEUTRAL THIRD PARTY ARBITRATOR DECIDE WHO IS RIGHT IN THAT INITIAL DISPUTE. AND AS MR YOU DO THE EXPLAINING SO KANN ALSO DID NOT REMAIN NEUTRAL ALLOW THE WORKERS TO ORGANIZE A UNION WITHOUT INTERFERENCE WHICH IS THE CORE PROMISE OF THE TRIBAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD THIS IS LIKELY NOT WHAT THE MEMBERS OF THIS LEGISLATURE WHO VOTED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN TO RATIFY IT TOOK MONTHS COMPACT. EXPECTED OR INTENDED WHEN THEY SOLD OUT. NO ONE'S COMPACT CONTAINS A DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS THAT APPLIES WHEN EITHER THE STATE OR THE TRIBE REACHES THE CONTACTS ARE RETAINS THE LABOR RELATIONS AND THE OTHER MATERIAL PROVISIONS OF THE CONTACT. THAT WAS A THIRTY DAY WRITTEN NOTICE TO CURE FOLLOWED BY A SUIT IN FEDERAL COURT FOR A DECLARATION THAT THE OTHER PARTY HAS MATERIALLY BREACH THE COMPOUND THE COURT ISSUES THAT DECLARATION AND THE VIOLATIONS CONTINUE THAN THE PARTY BRINGING THAT SUIT CLAIMING A VIOLATION. CAN UNILATERALLY TERMINATE THE CALL THAT'S WHAT THE QUALMS CONTACT SEX IN THE IN THE SITUATION I DESCRIBED IN THE STREET IT IS ROB WITH RESPECT TO LABOR RELATIONS THAT PROCESS PROVED TO BE INEFFECTIVE FOR TWO REASONS. AT THE OUTSET IT DIDN'T TO TURKS UPON FROM VIOLATING. A COMPLEX WEB OF RELATIONSHIPS AND THEN THE PROMPT EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY THE STATE DID NOT USE THIS PROCESS TO TRY TO ENFORCE THE COMPACT IT AND GRADUATED WITH THE STATE DID NOT. WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THE STATE GAVE SOMEONE A NOTICED YOU'RE THAT'S NOT PUBLIC INFORMATION ABOUT THIS WEEK THEY DID NOT. ZERO ONE PARTICULAR TORY JUDGMENT WHICH WOULD'VE FELT. BY WITH THE LEAD LABOR RELATIONS PROVISIONS OF THE COMPACT YEAH UNITE HERE DID SEE AVAILABLE IN THE DISTRICT FOUR AND AS PEOPLE HAVE STAYED IN THAT CASE IS NOW PENDING BEFORE THE NINTH CIRCUIT BUT IT'S BEEN A LONG PROCESS NEARLY TWO YEARS AND WE HAVE A LONG PROCESS. AHEAD OF THIS PROCESS THIS LEGAL PROCESS WILL PROBABLY TAKE LONGER. I THANK I'M CERTAIN THIS PROCESS WILL TAKE LONGER THAN HAVE THE STATE THE STATE BROUGHT THE INITIAL SUIT. UNDER THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISION OF THE CONTRACT ITSELF AND IN THE INTERIM. ONE IS ABLE TO DISREGARD ENTIRELY ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CONTRACT LABOR RELATIONS PROVISION SPEED IS IMPORTANT WHAT ORGANIZED EVERY DAY THAT SAQUON CAN DELAY ITS COMPLIANCE WITH THE KEELER RO MAKES IT MORE LIKELY THAT WORKERS WILL BECOME DEMORALIZED AND THEY WILL GIVE UP ON THEIR- BUT HAVING THE UNION IS RELEVANT TO THIS CASE ISN'T UNIQUE TO THE QUAN MR DELAY IS A STANDARD PLAYBOOK IN A PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYERS ACROSS INDUSTRIES USE THE SMART UNION ORGANIZER YOU COULD YOU WRAP UP PLEASE. YES AND- CALIFORNIA SHOULD LEARN FROM EXPERIENCE WITH THE QUAN- AND IT SHOULD BE WE BELIEVE IT SHOULD NEGOTIATE A DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURES- THAT STRENGTHEN THE STATE'S HANDS IF THERE'S A VIOLATION I JUST WANT TO CORRECT SOMETHING THAT MR VOCALLY SAD. THE COMPACT IT'LL BE FOR YOU DON'T REPLICATE WHAT'S IN THIS APARTMENT COMPLEX ACTUALLY MAKE THE PROCESS MORE TIME CONSUMING BUT NOT AN ALTERNATE BETWEEN ARBITRATION AND USING THE PROCESSES OF BONDS COMPANIES RIGHT. WHAT THE PROPOSED CONTRACT AND HIS SUBSEQUENT EXHAUSTING THE SECTION THREE POINT OUT THIRTEEN POINT OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURES PROVISIONS WHICH IS THE ARBITRATION. ONLY AFTER DOING THAT IN THIS STATE INVOKE. THE DECLARATORY RELIEF PROVISIONS WE THAT THEY PROF INJURED BE I HAPPY TO MY OR HOW THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS FOR MEMBERS DID FOR THE MEMBERS BECAUSE I HAD A NUMBER OF MEMBERS- CONTACT ME. REGARDING THIS TESTIMONY SINCE IT WASN'T REALLY IN REFERENCE TO EITHER ONE OF THE TRIBES HERE I FELT IT WAS- IMPORTANT THAT OUR MEMBERS UNDERSTAND- PARTICULARLY IN THE SPIRIT OF THESE- CONTACTS OVER THE YEARS WITH LABOR AND THE GREAT RELATIONSHIPS THAT- THE TRIBES OF HAD ALSO THIS COMMITTEE'S HAD WITH UNITE HERE. AND THE COOPERATIVE NATURE THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE TO GET A LITTLE BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF- WHAT WHAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON- WITH- THE LAWSUITS JUST TO GET UPDATED SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WILL NOW MOVE ON TO PUBLIC COMMENT.
