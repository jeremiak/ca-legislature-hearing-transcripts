A LOT OF- RESOURCES BEING ALLOCATED TO THOSE ITEMS AND- I'M SORT OF VAMPING HERE WAITING FOR SOMEBODY TO APPEAR ON THE SCREEN- TO HAVE THE- LA- READY TO SPEAK TO THIS ISSUE. ARRIGO. YOUR MUTED. OR MAYBE THREE RIGHT TRY AGAIN. SORRY CAN YOU DON'T KNOW YEAH IT WAS ALL ME. ALL I HAVE. CRISTINA LEGISLATIVE IN ARE THANK SO MUCH FOR HAVING TODAY- I DID YOUR ATTENTION LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED THREE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS AND PRIVATE RESILIENCE PACKAGE THAT WAS ONE OF. IF I'M NOT HAPPY THAT WOULD HAVE LAST YEAR UP FOR SECOND WHILE WE JUST VOLUME LIKE WE DID LAST WEEK. YOUR OUR VOLUME GUINEA PIG AGAIN. DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU DID LAST WEEK I'LL TRY AGAIN I THINK I CAN SPEAK MORE LOUDLY ABOUT TOTAL. YOUR PERFECT AT THE WITH THE VOLUME ON OUR SIDE THANK YOU VERY MUCH WOULD YOU MIND BEGIN YEAH. SURE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME TODAY MY NAME IS KHAN CRISTINA THE LATEST LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- ON. WEDNESDAY CHAIR MENTIONED LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE PASSED THREE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN A CLIMATE RESILIENCE PACKAGE AND I DID A GREAT SPENDING IN A VARIETY OF AREAS RELATED TO CLIMATE RESILIENCE I KNOW IT'S PART IN SEVERAL MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL PACKAGES THAT WERE PASSED LAST YEAR. AND IT PROVIDED OVER AND OVER A MULTI YEAR PERIOD AND WE DID HAVE A COUPLE COMMENTS WE WANTED TO PROVIDE I KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION MAY HAVE SOME COMMENTS AND I UPDATE ON WHERE THEY ARE ON THAT PACKAGE. BUT WHAT WE WANTED TO POINT OUT IS THAT IN IN A NUMBER OF CASES. PENDING WITH SCHEDULED OUT ALREADY FOR THIS YEAR- BUT THERE WAS THERE A COUPLE NOTABLE EXCEPTIONS SO- BUT THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF MONEY PROVIDED FOR NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS. AND EXTREME HEAT- BUT THOSE WERE PROVIDED INSTEAD OF SITES SO THAT THEIR THERE WASN'T A LOT OF I. ABOUT HOW THOSE BANDS WERE TO BE SPENT THOSE BY WERE TO BECOME IN THIS THIS YEAR. TWENTY TWENTY. I'M UNDERSTAND THE ADMINISTRATION IN. TO FORWARD WITH A PROPOSAL WITH THE MORE. HOW WOULD THOSE- THAT THAT MAY HAVE IN THIS. BUT WE HAVEN'T THAT YOU. I'M WE- THINK THAT WOULD BE. HOLD AS PART OF. THIS HEARING IS FOR THE- AFFECTING ABOUT THE FUN. THINKING ABOUT WHY- WHAT IT WOULD LIKE TO DO WITH THE FRIENDS- AND ALSO I AM MINUTES PROVIDE SOME. ON MY THEIR PLAN IS WHEN THEY MAKE COME FOR WITH MORE DETAIL. SPACE SORT OF SKETCH AN PROPOSAL. TO HOW THEY'RE GONNA SEND THOSE FUNDS. I'M BECAUSE WHEN IT CAN BE VERY CHALLENGING I JUST. IS ALL YOU KNOW I'M IT. IS RECEIVE A LOT OF. IN WHEN A VERY. TIME FRAME AND THERE'S NOT A LOT OF TIME TO REALLY CONSIDER THE MERITS. I'M AND THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF MONEY AND- IT'S HARD TO PACKAGE THE WHOLE AS WELL AS FOR THIS TO SPECIFIC. AREAS AND SO I'M REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE MAKE SURE IT'S COMFORTABLE WITH WHATEVER PLAN ADMINISTRATION COMES FORWARD WITH HOPEFULLY HAVE AS MUCH TIME AS POSSIBLE TO CONSIDER IT- AND REALLY START THINKING ABOUT THOSE THINGS BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO PROVIDE. SPECIFIC GUIDANCE FOR EXAMPLE AS PART OF TRAILER BILL OR BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE FUNDS ARE SPENT REALLY IN A WAY THAT CONSISTENT WITH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES. AND SO THAT'S OUR MAIN COMMENTS ON THAT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. EITHER NOW OR AFTER THAT AND I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION MAY ALSO BE AVAILABLE. I'M TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF AN UPDATE ON WHERE THEY ARE AND THAT'S FINE AND- I THINK THIS. THERE'S TO BE. AS WELL AS LARGER PACK. GREAT THANK YOU- I WOULD. QUESTION EFFORTS ARE. TILL AFTER. ALL OF THE- YOU. CAN MANAGEMENT STEP WE- THE THAT THE RESOURCES AGENCY. EVERYONE THIS IS A HANSEN THAT SECRETARY CLIMATE THE NATURAL THE CAN YOU HEAR ME. RIGHT OKAY WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE- I TO WALK THROUGH PRO TO THE STATUS AGREE TO AN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. AND AS YOU ALL KNOW BEEN WORKING WITH PARTNERS ACROSS THE ADMINISTRATION GEN. AT TO DEVELOP THREE PLANS THAT ARE VERY CRITICAL TO DELIVERING ON CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE AND BIODIVERSITY GOALS. THE FIRST IS OUR NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS CLIMATE SMART STRATEGY THIS WAS CALLED OR AND THE GOVERNOR'S NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS EXECUTIVE ORDER IT'S REALLY INTENDED TO SET OUT A VISION FOR GUIDING AND ACCELERATING LAND MANAGEMENT THAT DELIVERS ON CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE GOALS. BOTH CARBON NEUTRALITY AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE. SECOND STRATEGY THAT WE ARE WORKING ON IT IS OUR THIRTY BY THIRTY PATHWAY STRATEGY. WHICH WAS ALSO CALLED FOR IN THE GOVERNOR'S NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS EXECUTIVE ORDER. AND IT'S INTENDED TO OUTLINE OUR APPROACH TO ACHIEVING THE GOAL OF CONSERVING 30% OF OUR LANDS AND COASTAL WATERS BY TWENTY THIRTY. AND THE FINAL PLAN UNDER WAY IS OUR EXTREME HEAT ACTION PLAN. WHICH WAS DEVELOPED AS A RESULT OF OUR WORK TO UPDATE THE STATE'S ADAPTATION STRATEGY AND REALIZING WE REALLY NEEDED STRATEGIC AND COMPREHENSIVE SET. OF STATE ACTIONS TO ADAPT TO AND BUILD RESILIENCE TO EXTREME HEAT- HELLO ALL OF THESE STRATEGIES WERE DEVELOPED THROUGH EXTENSIVE PUBLIC INPUT OVER THE COURSE OF LAST YEAR- WE HELD REGIONAL WORKSHOP WE HAD NUMEROUS COMPLICATIONS WITH CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES. AND WE HELD AN EXTREME HEAT WORKSHOP SERIES. FEEDBACK THAT WE RECEIVED THROUGH ALL OF THIS ENGAGEMENT. HAS DEEPLY INFLUENCED BOTH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DRAFT THAT HAVE ALL BEEN RELEASED- WE'VE ALSO TAKEN A REAL YOU ARE HELPFUL APPROACH TO ENSURING THAT THE FEEDBACK THAT WE RECEIVED ON THE DRAFT PLANS. OR FINAL STRATEGIES AS WELL AS OUR APPROACH TO DEVELOPING PROPOSALS FOR THE FUTURE OF THE SOLUTION SET ASIDE AND THE EXTREME HEAT SET ASIDE WE'RE REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO BUILDING OUT THOSE FINAL STRATEGIES AND TO USING THAT PUBLIC INPUT THAT WE RECEIVE TO INFORM OUR APPROACH. FOR BCPS AND- IN THE SPRING SO I'LL STOP THERE AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME. THANK YOU. THANK GOD- NEXT UP WE HAVE- DOCTOR GOAL FROM THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL. THE MORNING CARE BLOEMEN COMMITTEE MEMBERS ON THE RESOURCES IN THE CURRENT BUDGET WILL ENABLE THE OCEAN TEXTING COUNCIL TO PURSUE A NUMBER OF CRITICAL AREAS RELATED TO BUILDING CALIFORNIA'S- CULTURE RESILIENCE ALL OF THESE EFFORTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR STRATEGIC PLAN TO PROTECT ON CALIFORNIA'S COAST AND OCEAN. ON THE SCIENCE SIDE. WE WILL UPDATE THE TECH GUIDANCE FOR SEA LEVEL RISE FOR THE STATE USING THE LATEST SCIENCE. WELL THE NATIONAL ASSESSMENT FOR SEA LEVEL RISE COMES OUT NEXT WEEK ON FEBRUARY FIFTEENTH AND THAT'LL BE A VERY CRITICAL PART. OF ON DEVELOPING THAT GUIDANCE. ALSO WILL BUILD ON EXISTING EFFORTS TO COMPLETE A HABITAT VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT FOR WETLANDS BEACHES AND ROCKY INTERTIDAL HABITAT. ACTION PLANS WILL BE DEVELOPED FOR ALL THREE OF THESE KINDS OF HABITATS MOVING FORWARD. ON THE RESTORATION SIDE WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THE RESTORATION OF CRITICAL YOUNG GRASS HABITAT- ALONG- THROUGHOUT THE STATE. ALONG OUR SHORES AND ON THE PLANNING SIDE WILL PROVIDE FUNDING ASSISTANCE THROUGH YOUR B. C. D. C. A. R. THEIR BAD DOCTOR EFFORTS TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE COASTAL RESILIENCE PLAN FOR STARTERS. AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH STATE PARKS AND SUPPORT THEM. ON THEIR PART SPECIFIC C. LEVEL RISE ADAPTATION PLANNING EFFORTS TECHNICAL CONSULTATION- TO THE COASTAL CONSERVANCY'S EFFORTS TO FUND PROJECTS TO USE NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS THE BILL CALLED THE RESILIENCE. ON ON OUR CALIFORNIA'S COAST THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT AS THE COASTAL CONSERVANCY. GOOD MORNING A CAN YOU HEAR ME YES I CAN GOOD MORNING RIGHT. HI THIS IS AMY HOW TALL I AM- THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER AT THE STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY AND THE COASTAL CONSERVANCY IS- PROPOSING TO USE THAT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION FOR COASTAL RESILIENCE THAT'S IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- THROUGH OUR EXISTING CLIMATE READY PROGRAM. TO FIND PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A BROAD SUITE OF THE COASTAL RESILIENCE PROJECTS- WE'RE NOT INTENDING TO CREATE A NEW PROGRAM THE WE ARE UPDATING OUR STRATEGIC PLAN THIS CALENDAR YEAR TO AID OUR STAFF AND BOARD IN PRIORITIZING PROJECTS. WE WILL ALSO RELY HEAVILY ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE THIRTY BY THIRTY PATHWAY STRATEGY AND THE NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS CLIMATE SMART STRATEGY SAID THOSE- REPORTS AND ALL OF THE PUBLIC INPUT THAT WENT INTO THOSE REPORTS- WILL HEAVILY INFLUENCE OF THE- SPENDING OF OUR COASTAL RESILIENCE BY- THE COASTAL CONSERVE. FUNDING WILL FOCUS ON SUPPORTING COMMUNITY HE'S THAT HAVE LIMITED OUR CAPACITY TO PLAN AND IMPLEMENT CLIMATE RESILIENCE PROJECTS SO UNDERSERVED. COMMUNITIES ARE COMMUNITIES THAT LACK- THE RESOURCES TO UNDERTAKE THIS WORK BASED COASTAL RESILIENCE PROJECTS SUCH AS PROJECTS THAT EMPLOY BEACHES DUNES WETLANDS AND LIVING SHORELINES. I WOULD NOTE THE GAPS IN THE STATE'S ABILITY TO ADAPT TO SEA LEVEL RISE WILL REMAIN EVEN AND WITH THIS SIGNIFICANT COASTAL RESILIENCE FUNDING- PARTICULARLY FOR LOW LYING RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE SO I THINK THAT SOMETHING. UP FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONTINUE TO THINK ABOUT. AN OF THE NEEDS ARE HUGE THE THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION AND IS- AN EXTREMELY SIGNIFICANT FUNDING LEVEL FOR THE COASTAL CONSERVANCY- IT IS YOU KNOW ON PAR WITH SOME OF THE PAST- BOND FUNDING BUT THIS IS ALL AND- YOU KNOW ONE YEAR COMING TO US- BUT THE NEEDS ARE- VERY SIGNIFICANT WE'RE WORKING ON MAJOR NATURAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. THAT COULD EASILY USE YOU KNOW CAN TELL HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON THEIR OWN AND WE WANT TO REACH AN BUILD A NEW COMMUNITIES TO UNDERTAKE PROJECTS- AND TO BENEFIT COMMUNITIES THAT WILL BE MOST IMPACTED BY CLIMATE CHANGE AND THAT LACK THE RESOURCES- TO UNDERTAKE THE WORK THEMSELVES- SET THAN. YOU VERY. THANK YOU DOES- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAVE CHRIS ARCHER TO WHAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I DON'T HAVE ANY FORMAL PRESENTATION OR COMMENTS BUT- I'M AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE THANK YOU FOR A WHILE WE TAKE QUESTIONS ON- THIS PARTICULAR ITEM THIS IS A BIG ONE- AND- ALL BEGIN BY. ASKING THE- NATURE. NATURE BASED SET ASIDES FIVE HUNDRED NINETY THREE MILLION DOLLARS- CAN YOU TELL US. HOW MUCH OF THAT IS INTENDED TO BE USED FOR CONSERVATION AND- AND- HOW MUCH FOR OUT REACH HOW MUCH FOR RESTORATION TO HAVE A- DIDN'T DO ANY OF YOU HAVE A BREAK JOHN HOW. THAT'S INTENDED TO BE UTILIZED. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AGAIN THE MONEY HANSEN FROM THE RESOURCES AGENCY OUT WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF BUILDING OUT OUR PROPOSALS FOR THE NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS THAT ASIDE WE DON'T HAVE A BREAKDOWN FOR YOU BUT I WILL SAY THAT ALL THREE OF THOSE GOALS ARE AT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS CRITICAL FOR ACHIEVING THE GOALS OF BOTH THIRTY BY THIRTY AND THAT KIND OF HEARTLAND MANAGEMENT SO YOU WILL SEE CONSERVATION RESTORATION AND OUTREACH. IN THE PROPOSAL PUT FORWARD IN THE SPRING. SO A LOT OF THIS IS IN FURTHERANCE OF THE F. THIRTY. I'M SORRY OF THE THIRTY BY THIRTY CONSERVATION GOAL. WHICH I THINK IS VERY LAUDABLE AND I SUPPORTED BUT- HAS THE STATE DEVELOPED A VISION FOR ACHIEVING THAT. AND IF SO. LET US KNOW WHAT IT IS. WELL PERHAPS ALL TAKE A FIRST CRACK AND THEN HANDED OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE MARK IN CASE YOU HAVE ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO HAPPEN BECAUSE I KNOW HE'S BEEN WORKING. CLOSELY ON THIS BUT I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW THE VISION FOR A THIRTY BY THIRTY. IS TO AT. ED SHEERAN DURING CONSERVATION MEASURES% THAT DELIVER ON OUR GOALS OF PROTECTING BIODIVERSITY ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE AND INCREASING ACCESS TO NATURE THAT IS OUR VISION FOR THIRTY BY THIRTY THAT THAT THOSE ARE THE GOALS- AS WHICH IUNDERSTAND- OF THE I THINK THE QUESTION IS. HOW DO WE ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS HOW TO USE THE RESOURCES- THAT WE'RE ALLOCATING AT THIS TIME. OF TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS SO- I ASSUME SOME OF THAT WILL. BE CONTAINED IN THE BCP THAT'LL BE. COMING AT US AT AT SOME POINT CAN YOU GIVE SOME SPECIFICITY AS TO WHEN WE MAY RECEIVE THAT BCP. I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE B. C. B. WILL BE COMING THROUGH THE SPRING PROCESS I CAN ALSO TELL YOU THAT WE ARE FOCUSED ON ENSURING THERE IS FUNDING FOR- ACQUISITION AND EASEMENTS THAT WILL SUPPORT OUR THIRTY BY THIRTY GOAL. YEAH I JUST WANNA JUMP AND- OR BRIEF MOMENT I'M SURE BUT ON. IT IT'S A CITY IT'S A SYSTEM APPROACH BASED ON THE PATHWAYS DOCUMENT AND THE PATHWAYS DOCUMENT ON. I CAME OUT IN DRAFT FORM AND- YOU KNOW VERY VERY PUBLIC FIFTEEN PLUS PUBLIC MEETINGS ETCETERA. AND EXCEL FILE IT FINALIZING THAT DOCUMENT IS BEEN ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL- IN IN BEING ABLE TO DEVELOP ON THE DETAIL THAT. AMANDA HAS TALKED ABOUT ON THAT SO CRITICAL IN PROVIDING YOU HOW TO ACTUALLY REACH ON THE AMBITIOUS GOALS WITHIN THE PATHWAY DOCUMENT WITHOUT A DOCUMENT ITSELF IS LIKE SEVENTY PAGES LONG. AND CONTAINS A LOT OF DETAIL ON HOW. THE APPROACH IS TO ACTUALLY ACHIEVE- THE GOAL STATED. OKAY THAT'S UNDERSTOOD- I APPRECIATE THAT- I THINK THE QUESTION REMAINS- YOU KNOW WHEN WILL RE RECEIVE WHAT THE- VISION. OF THE ADMINISTRATION IS THAT BASED ON THAT DOCUMENT- SO THAT WE HAVE SOME SPECIFICITY. HERE AND CAN INTELLIGENTLY DISCUSS IT WITH YOU- BUT. EVENT PERHAPS YOU CAN- OUR FOR OUR EDIFICATION NOT DOCTOR GOLD SUMMARIZE- THAT PLAN. WHERE YOU ARE RIGHT NOW ON. YEAH I PRETTY MUCH TOOK THE FINAL COMMENTS ON I THINK HURT THE DEADLINE TO RECEIVE ANY OF THEM IS BY NEXT WEEK I'M AND SO I EAT SO FINALIZING THE PLAN WILL BE REALLY IMMEDIATELY THEREAFTER AND THE NEXT AND THE NEXT FEW WEEKS- BUT BUT THAT DISCUSSIONS THAT. DAY THE ITEMS THAT YOU'RE BRINGING UP RIGHT NOW REALLY ARE THE CRITICAL NEXT STEP. ON WHAT WHAT WE DIDN'T WANT TO DO IS SEE AN RNA WAS TO MAKE FUNDING RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO SPEND INTEL THAT PLAN WAS COMPLETED BECAUSE WE DON'T. KNOW WHAT WE FELT THAT THIS WAS SUCH A PUBLIC PROCESS WE DON'T WANT TO DO SOMETHING THAT WAS INCONSISTENT- WITH WITH THE PATHWAY- ON OUR DEVELOPMENT AND SO I'M I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT I MEAN C'MON AT DAWN AND MAYBE BRIAN- I DON'T I DON'T KNOW WHETHER WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE. RECOMMENDATIONS WITHIN- BY TH END. OF ON. BY MAYBE. BY APRIL EARLY APRIL WAIT WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS BE FOR THE STAMP OF USING THE PATH OF DOCTOR AND MAKE. THE SORTS OF RED. THIS IS. WITHIN THAT RESOURCE DEFENSE JEROBOAM WE WORKING. QUICKLY AS- TO- TO GET THE REQUEST YOU- THROUGH THE- SO IT'LL BECOME OUT- BUT WE ARE WORKING TO GET IT TO YOU AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. OKAY BY ME JUST ALSO JUMP IN I WOULD. I WOULD ALSO JUST LIKE THE FLAG THAT WE DID LAY OUT- OUR SORT OF. INITIAL THOUGHTS ON. THE GENERAL WORKSTREAMS AB FOUR. ADS UTILIZING THESE FUNDS AND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET IN JANUARY WE LAID OUT FIVE DIFFERENT WORKSTREAMS. ADDED FOR FUNDING AT. THAT AGE BASED. TAXIS. I WORK. FOR IN. NATURE BASED. BY THAT BASED ON THE IN WE RECEIVED ON THE DRY FOR THIRTY BY THIRTY THE NATIONAL PLAN AT OUR STRATEGY WE ALSO LAID OUT FOR. AREAS FOCUS THE EXTREMES. AB FIVE. AND YOU KNOW. MAYBE A THROUGH THE CORE OF INPUT THAT READ RECEIVE HONEST BY THAT I THINK. LATE OUT OF THE NATIONAL QUITE LIKELY. OKAY I. ALL THE- IT'S HARD FOR ME TO- AND HARD FOR THE SUBCOMMITTEE TO EVALUATE AND WEIGH IN ON- I WHAT I THINK IS OVER TWO BILLION DOLLARS AND ALLOCATION WITHOUT HAVING AT LEAST. OF COURSE YOU WANT TO GO WITH US I THINK THERE'S A GREAT MOTIVATION ON THE PART OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE TO GET ON THE SAME PAGE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION BUT WE'VE GOT TO HAVE THE PAGE BEFORE US SO THAT WE CAN- SEE IT AND COMMENT ON THAT AND TO HAVE AN INTELLIGENT THE- OF CONVERSATION I THINK SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES MAY WANT TO WEIGH. IN ON THIS- MS RIVAS. THANK YOU CHAIR BLOWN- I HAVE QUESTIONS ON THE EXTREME HEAT PROGRAMS AND- THE BUDGET. OF THAT YOU'RE PROPOSING AND I WAS EXCITED- THAT IT WAS THAT THE EXTREME HEAT. ARE WAS. IT PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THIS YEAR. AND YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAVE AN EXTREME HEAT. ACTION PLAN I KNOW IT'S A DRAFT RIGHT NOW AND I'VE DISCUSSED IT- WITH YOUR AGENCY ALREADY- BUT- ONE OF MY QUESTIONS AS YOU KNOW THERE ARE OVER. TWENTY STATE AGENCIES. AND IN A LONG LIST OF TASKS AND RECOMMENDED ACTIONS IN THIS. DRAFT FRAMEWORK. WHICH PROJECTS WILL BE PRIORITIZED AND HOW WILL ALL OF THESE AGENCIES COORDINATE WITH EACH OTHER TO IMPLEMENT THESE TASKS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION YES- THERE THERE WERE A NUMBER OF AGENCIES THAT WE WORK WITH TO DEVELOP AN ACTION PLAN- WHICH REALLY REFLECTS THE NATURE OF THIS PARTICULAR CLIMATE THREAT WHICH I THINK IS YOU KNOW BETTER THAN MOST BUT- IT'S GOING TO AFFECT EVERY CALIFORNIA IN EVERY REGION ACROSS THE STATE- SO TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION ABOUT THAT PRIORITIZATION FOR IMPLEMENTATION. WE DO LAY OUT IN OUR IN OUR ACTION PLAN IN THE DRAFT EIGHT AREAS OF NEAR TERM FOCUS AND I WOULD SAY THAT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THIS IS HOW WE WILL PRIORITIZE THE WORK. THAT WE DO AND THEN TO ANSWER HER QUESTION AROUND CORONATION FOR IMPLEMENTATION YOU KNOW OUR ADMINISTRATION IS WORKING REALLY HARD TO ADDRESS THE CLIMATE CRISIS AS THE CRISIS THAT IT IS AND SO WE WORKED TOGETHER VERY REGULARLY AT TO IMPLEMENT OUR OUR OUR- YOU KNOW. MULTIPLE CLIMATE PLANS TO ACHIEVE OUR CLIMATE TARGETS- AND TO THINK THROUGH YOU KNOW HOW WE CAN ALIGN AND LEVERAGE OUR OUR WORK ACROSS AGENCIES AND SO- WE WILL BE. COORDINATING IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS FOR FINALIZING THIS ACTION PLAN AND WILL CONTINUE THAT ORDINATION. THROUGH OUR IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH. AND HAVE YOU AYE. LIKE WHAT KIND OF PROJECT WOULD BE. IMPACTFUL TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO THIS YEAR. I WOULD POINT AGAIN TO THOSE AREAS OF NEAR TERM FOCUS- IT IS IT IS ALSO BECOME VERY I THINK THOSE WERE IN ADDITION TO REFLECTING THE ADMINISTRATION'S PRIORITIES THOSE WERE BUILT OUT BASED ON WHAT WE HEARD FROM MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THE ACTING AND- SO- YEAH. THOSE WILL BE AT OUR OUR FOCUS IS MOVING FORWARD. OKAY THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENNETT- THANK YOU- I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON- CHAIRMAN BLOOMS- COMMENTS- AND- IN AN ECHO HIS SPIRIT OF COOPERATION THAT HE'S HE'S- OFFERING- IN AND JUST SUGGESTS THAT FOR ALL OF US THIS WEEK WE CAN ALL GET FOCUSED ON DOING GOOD GOVERNMENT FOR THE RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA- IF WE CAN FIND A WAY TO- ADDRESS THE SORT OF ON- THERE'S A- BUDGET YOU KNOW THERE'S A BUDGET REQUEST. AND HOW MUCH SPECIFICITY SHOULD BE IN THE BUDGET REQUEST IS SORT OF A THERE'S A NORMAL TENSION THERE- THERE'S ALSO- A NORMAL- TENSION IN TERMS OF- WANTING TO- AT LEAST BE ABLE TO GIVE FEEDBACK- HAS THAT MONEY BECAUSE IT WE'RE IN THE PROCESS SO IF WE COULD JUST IDENTIFY. SORT OF WHERE ARE YOU KNOW PROACTIVELY BEFORE WE ARE CONSTANTLY IN THE SITUATION WE COULD IDENTIFY PROACTIVELY WE'RE WOULD BE THE REPORTS. YOU KNOW WHERE WHERE DO WE ACTUALLY NEED TO REPORTS IN TERMS OF THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS THE ADMINISTRATION IN TERMS OF SPENDING THE SAYINGS. OF SO THAT WE CAN SAY WE CAN HAVE SOME SENSE OF CERTAINTY HATER REPORTS GOING TO BE AT THIS POINT TIME OR THAT PART TIME- BECAUSE WE DO PRETTY CONSISTENTLY HERE. YOU KNOW WE CAN'T SAY WHEN THAT REPORTS GOING TO BE READY- AND THAT MAKES A GROUP MADE IT JUST MAKES IT DIFFICULT SO IT'S NOT AN ATTEMPT. TO TRY TO CREATE- CREATE MORE TENSION EDITORS ALWAYS GOING TO BE SOME SOME- YOU KNOW SOME TENSION THERE. BUT IT'S REALLY A AN OFFER TO SAY WE CAN. WE CAN GIVE FEEDBACK TO THE ADMINISTRATION BETTER IF WE HAVE THAT AND WE CAN GO BACK AND- SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE ADMINISTRATION EVERYBODY IS EXCITED ABOUT THE THIRTY. TO THIRTY PROPOSITION THAT IS OUT THERE- BUT IF WE'RE SHOOTING BLANKS AND TALKING ABOUT IT WE CAN'T REALLY HELP THE ADMINISTRATION AS MUCH AS WE COULD. IF THAT WASN'T THE CASE SO- THAT WOULD LIKE TO OFFER THAT AND TEN VERY VERY QUICKLY I JUST LIKE TO OFFER MY INPUT IN TERMS OF. WHEN IT COMES TO THE- THE NATURE BASED- FUNDING- THE NATURE SET ASIDE FUNDING THAT WE HAVE THERE- THE- I THINK WE GET TREMENDOUS BANG FOR OUR BUCK EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT A LOT OF LAND SCHOOL. ACREAGE WE GET TREMENDOUS BANG FOR A BUCK WITH WITH WETLANDS INVESTMENTS WESSEL WETLANDS RESTORATION AND WITH MARINE SANCTUARIES. AND SO I JUST LIKE TO RAISE MY VOICE TO SUGGEST THOSE ARE THOSE ARE. HIGH VALUE INVESTMENTS THAT WE CAN MAKE AS WE MOVE FORWARD- AND THEN- ONE OTHER- ON THE SEA LEVEL RISE. IF WE COULD HAVE- THE REPRESENTATIVE AND JUST LIKE TO ASK THIS QUESTION SHE SHE MENTIONED. HOW LITTLE MONEY WE HAVE RELATIVE TO THE NEED OUT THERE. BUT IT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL IF WE HAVE AN IDENTIFICATION OF. WHAT ARE THE MAJOR AND SIGNIFICANT SEA LEVEL RISE. ISSUES THAT WE SHOULD BE ADDRESSING WHAT KIND OF FUNDING ARE WE TALKING ABOUT- IN IN TERMS OF. WHAT REMAINS YOU KNOW IF WE CAN IDENTIFY HATE LOOK AT THESE THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS. THE NEXT THIRTY YEARS BASED ON OUR PROJECTIONS ARE FIFTY YEARS. AND SO WE AT LEAST GET THE LISTINGS IDENTIFIED IN. I WOULD BE WILLING TO SET SOME MONEY ASIDE. FOR THAT IDENTIFICATION SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A HEALTHY CONVERSATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. I SURE SOMEONE OR- OF GO AHEAD OF. RIGHT YOU SO MUCH- YEAH A LOT A LOT DO SO WITH ME- BUT I THINK I THINK I'VE GOT I THINK I'VE GOT THE MALL COP TO SOME MEMBER BAND. ON SO THE CEILING RISE SO SAW ON A YOUR IN YOUR CLASS SOMETHING TO WERE WORD THAT'S ALL THAT'S A TOP PRIORITY FOR THE US INTO CAL TIME AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO IT ON. USING IT WORKING WITH LITERALLY THE TOP SCIENTISTS I'M ON THE WEST COAST ON A RELATED TO THE ISSUE SO STRONG I FEEL VERY VERY GOOD ABOUT THAT I'M YOUR COMMENT ON WETLANDS AND ASHMAN SANCTUARIES I COULD AGREE WITH YOU MORE ON TO HUGE PRIORITIES FOR US. I'M NOT A RESOURCES AGENCY- SECRETARY PROFILE- I'D SENT A LETTER OUT A WEEK AGO- SUPPORTING THE CHUMASH HERITAGE NATIONALLY SANCTUARY- AND WE'RE REALLY EXCITED TO WORK. WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON THAT AND AS WELL AS TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR NATIONAL MEANS SANCTUARIES ARE REALLY PROVIDING MORE CONSERVATION BENEFIT AS PART OF THIRTY BY THIRTY SO THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS ABSOLUTELY AT A TOP PRIORITY AND IS HIGHLIGHTED ON IN THE PATHWAY DOCUMENT. FOR THIRTY BY THIRTY. I'M THEY'RE NOT THE PER CANCER- BUT FOLLOWING ON YOUR IN SCHOOL A LEAST TOPICAL RIGHT SO IT'S NOT GIVING YOU MAY WITHOUT GIVING YOU STATE WHICH KNOW IS WHAT REQUIRE. BUT BY. HEY I DO WANT TO AND UPON YOU THE BILL A GOOD DEAL FROM STANDPOINT OF THE SORT OF. THAT WILL BE FOR AND- THAT THAT YOU'LL A LOT MORE DE. ON IN THE WEEKS AHEAD. AND SO THIS IS- IF YOU CAN IMAGINE THE HABITAT CONSERVATION ON FOREST DESERT OAK WHAT LET WOODLAND RIPARIAN RESTORATION RANGELAND. GRASS GRAZING LAND GRASSLAND PROTECTION ON THE PROJECTS THAT EXPAND EQUITABLE ACCESS TO NATURE PROTECT BIODIVERSITY AND DELIVER CLIMATE BENEFITS ARE MULTI. BENEFITS APPROACH ON TO REALLY PROTECT DANG AND I'M GETTING THE MOST FROM A CONSERVATION BASIS OF OUR BOTH ARE NATURAL AND ARE WORKING LANDS THAT'S A BIG PRIORITY. CATALYZING REGIONAL ACTION PURE EXPANDED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND CAPACITY BUILDING. YOU GOT TO DO CONSERVATION FROM A LOCAL BASIS AND FROM THE STATE BASIS AND SO WORKING WITH THE LOCALS AND PROVIDING THAT. ASSISTANCE IN CAP CAPACITY BUILDING IS CRITICAL INCREASING WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES TO CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS AND LOCAL CONSERVATION CORPS AND TRIBAL CONSERVATION COURSE. ON AN EXPANDING ENVIRONMENTAL LITERACY THAT THAT'S PART OF THIS AS WELL. PARTNERING WITH THEIR NAME CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES TO IMPLEMENT SHARED NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS. WE'RE ALL VERY EXCITED ABOUT POTENTIAL FOR CALL MANAGEMENT AS PART OF THIRTY BY THIRTY AS WELL. I'M AND THEN FINALLY SUPPORTING ADDITIONAL STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS TO DRIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NATIONAL WORKING LANSING CLIMATE STRATEGY AND PATHWAYS THAT THIRTY BY THIRTY DOCUMENTS SO THAT WE TALKED ABOUT AT LENGTH. BUT HOPEFULLY THAT WILL IS A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION I KNOW IT'S NOT AS COMPLETE AS YOU WANT ONE DOLLAR AMOUNTS AND EVERYTHING. THOSE ARE THE CATEGORIES IN WHICH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IF I COULD FOLLOW. YOUR DISCOVERED WITH. AT THE END I APPRECIATE THE WITH THREE TO YOUR YOUR FOR COM ABOUT YOUR VOTE. TO INVEST SUCCESS. IS THERE SOME. OF REAP YOUR TO BE. ANSWERS KIND OF IDENTIFY. OF WHAT MAJOR RISK ARE OUT THERE IN FRONT OF US WITH A MAJOR. SORT OF DOLLAR FIGURE KIND OF COST ARE ANYTHING LIKE THAT. THIS IS SHE LEVEL RISE I ON ON THE AMOUNT ON FOR THE ENTIRE CITY CALIFORNIA THAT HAS NOT BEEN DONE AT THIS POINT THERE'S BEEN SPECIFIC STUDIES HAVE BEEN DONE ON VULNERABILITY ON OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM- CALTRANS IS UNDERTAKEN I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NUMBER OF TIME AHEAD BUT IT'S INCREDIBLY LARGE I'M ALSO STAMPED AS KOBE B. CDC AND OTHERS AS DONE ON SOME ARE SORT OF WORK. BUT THERE HASN'T BEEN A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY FOR THE WHOLE STATE JERRY IS THERE A LIST OF IS THERE JUST A LIST OF WHAT THE PROJECTS ARE WHETHER THERE'S. A DOLLAR AMOUNT ASSOCIATED OR NOT. FONG WE CAN YOU SUCH A LESS THAT- IT IS NOT BILLION PENSION UP AT THE POINT LITERALLY IN OUR STREETS PLAN AND EVERYTHING I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. IS IN THE STRATEGIC PLAN FOR CUTS IN OCEANS WHICH WAS APPROVED TWO YEARS AGO. SO IF YOU COULD PROVIDE THAT STEPHENS SAID RATHER PUSH IT THANK YOU. YOU GOT IT. MR FONG. I THINK RICHARD BLUM A MY QUESTION A I DON'T BELIEVE IN THE- I DO WOULD LIKE TO KNOW FROM A- STANDPOINT DRAFTING- THESE PROPOSALS WHO ARE THE MAJOR STAKEHOLDERS- I'VE SKIMMED THROUGH YOUR SEVENTY THREE PAGE REPORT. IT'S VERY BROAD BUT I WONDER IF YOU COULD JUST GIVE US A FLAVOR OF WHO'S PARTICIPATING. OKAY WELL I'LL GET STARTED AND I CAN OUTLINED LEAST ON THE NATURAL WORKING LANDS CLIMATE MY STRATEGY IN THE EXTREME HEAT ACTION PLAN AND THAT ALL THE END UP TO OTHERS TO WEIGH IN ON THE OTHER. AS HE SAID- I THINK I MENTIONED IN MY REMARKS WE WORKED WITH. AGENCIES MANY MANY AGENCIES ACROSS THE ADMINISTRATION- WHETHER IT WAS YOU KNOW. YOUR TYPICAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCIES COUNTY PA CDFA- WE ALSO WORK WITH OPR NASTY SEAT WE ALSO DID A LOT OF WORK WITH AGENCIES THAT WE HAVEN'T TYPICALLY- YOU KNOW THOUGHT ABOUT OUR NEXUS WITH SO FOR EXAMPLE THAT DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES. CAL STAT- SO BAD IS IT CETERA. STAKEHOLDERS IT IS IT IS AN INCREDIBLE BREATH- ENTITIES THAT WE REACHED OUT TO DEVELOP. BOTH THE EXTREME HEAT ACTION PLAN AND THE CLIMATE SMART LAND STRATEGY- I. I WOULD I WOULD HESITATE TO TRY TO LIST THEM ALL HERE BECAUSE I'M CONCERNED I'LL LEAVE SOMEONE OUT BUT IT WAS A SIGNIFICANT- CROSSED REGIONS AND SECTORS OF CALIFORNIA. IS THERE A LIST SOMEWHERE I COULD SEE WHERE THE WHO WHO PARTICIPATED. I'M SURE WE CAN DEVELOP A LIST OF THOSE WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE- IN THE WORKSHOPS AND- THE EXTREME HEAT SORT OF SERIES THAT WE DID SURE YEAH I'M I'M JUST I'M CURIOUS AS ONE MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT MISSING- FOLKS AT THE ESPECIALLY OF- IT VOICES THAT NEED TO BE INVOLVED- I GUESS THE OTHER DELYLAH LAST QUESTION I GUESS IS THERE IS A AND A DESIRE FOR MORE SPECIFICITY I GUESS AS YOU DEVELOP THE PROPOSAL IN THE SPRING HOW SPECIFIC DO YOU ANTICIPATED TO BE. ARE YOU GOING DOWN AT THE PROJECT LEVEL OR- WHAT WHAT TYPE OF SPECIFICS EVER GONNA GET WHEN WE GET YOUR BCP. SO OUR APPROACH TO BUILDING OUT THE BCP IT IS TO IDENTIFY PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES THAT WILL DELIVER ON. THAT WHAT'S BEING CALLED OR IN THESE VARIOUS STRATEGIES AND SO. I THINK. I'LL I'M NOT SURE IF YOU WANT FURTHER DETAILS FROM THERE BUT- WE WILL BE A LINK SPECIFIC PROGRAMS I DON'T WANT TO GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE OF A OF A PROJECT. THEY GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE WHAT A PROJECT YOU'D WANT TO BE FUNDED. THAT'S IT WELL UNDER CONSIDERATION I'M ON I COULD I COULD TALK ABOUT THAT IN TERMS OF THE COASTAL RESILIENCE FUNDING- YOU KNOW THE COASTAL CONSERVANCY WE HAVE- DEVELOPED- MANY NATURE BASED LARGE SCALE NATURE BASED PROJECTS OVER THE YEARS WE HAVE. REALLY A PIPELINE OF PROJECTS THAT WE HAVE BEEN PLANNING IN SAN FRANCISCO BAG AND ON THE ENTIRE COAST OF CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- THAT- YOU KNOW WITH THAT THIS FUNDING WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT SO THESE INCLUDE PROJECTS LIKE WITHOUT BASS HELP ON. A RESTORATION PROJECT- OR MON BEACH- LOS RETOS WETLANDS- WE DO LIVING SHORELINE PROJECTS OYSTER AND EELGRASS RESTORATION- IN SAN FRANCISCO BAY IN SAN DIEGO BAY A DUNE RESTORATION PARTICULARLY. IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SO ON THE COASTAL RESILIENCE SIDE- WE HAVE A NUMBER OF PROJECTS IN PLAY THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD. WITH THIS FUNDING NEEDS ARE PROJECTS THAT HAVE OF- GONE THROUGH SEE WHAT ARE IN PERMITTING- PHASES IN IN PLANNING AND DESIGN IN ADDITION TO THAT WE WANT TO REACH OUT TO- OTHER COMMUNITIES PARTICULARLY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES- AND DEVELOP- ADDITIONAL PROJECTS AND FOR THE COASTAL CONSERVANCY OUR FOCUS IS VERY MUCH ON WORKING WITH NATURE. ON TO ADDRESS C. LEVEL. RISE THERE OBVIOUSLY- SICKENING AGAIN- AMOUNTS OF IN YOUR- AT AT RISK OF SEA LEVEL RISE WHERE NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS- ARE NOT- NECESSARILY THE BEST ANSWER- SO. YOU KNOW BACK ON THAT DOLLAR FIGURE. THIS THIS BUDGET YEAR SURE I APPRECIATE- I APPRECIATE THE SENTIMENT. I GUESS I'M AN ECHO THAT THIS IS THE BUDGET CAN WE DO WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE AMOUNTS AND WHAT WE'RE- AND THAT THEN THAT TYPE OF SPECIFICITY SO- YOU KNOW. I'M JUST GONNA SAY YOU CAN'T COME BEFORE THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND ASK FOR MONEY AND NOT GIVE US ANY SPECIFICITY- SO IN TERMS OF LIKE PRIVATIZATION LIKE WHAT PART WHAT PART IN. A PRIORITIZE- WERE CAN GOING PER. WHAT THE STRATEGY IS- WHAT THE PROGRAM ARE ONE OF THE FUNDED- THINK THAT'S THE MINIMUM THE WAR AT FOR NOT NOT AS AN OUT DON'T THINK WE'RE ANYTHING THAT IS. ADELINE YEARS SO- I GUESS I SHARE THE FRUSTRATION BUT I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO SET MORE DETAILS AT SUIT WE WANT I GUESS WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS- DEFINITELY NEEDED IS MORE SERVICES TO SPECIFICITY SO AS YOU DEVELOP YOUR- PROPOSAL- IN THE SPRING- I WOULD. ENCOURAGE YOU TO BE AS SPECIFIC AS POSSIBLE THANK YOU WELL- AND I'M GONNA HAVE A FOLLOW QUESTION FOR YOU- A MISSILE SO BUT- THE ME JUST ADD TO THE- I DON'T WANT TO. DEFER THESE ALLOCATE TO YEAR BUT- ODD THE NEXT BUDGETS I. BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THESE THINGS AND THE AMOUNT OF DETAIL THAT'S APPROPRIATE TO THIS SUBCOMMITTEE- AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT. HI I HAVE YOU ALL KNOW THIS WE HAVE- STAFF THAT NEEDS TIME TO DO THEIR ANALYSIS AND REPORT TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE THEN WE NEED TO GET IT INTO THE SCHEDULE AND IT ALL NEEDS TO- FIT WITHIN. OUR- CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY TO PASS A BUDGET- THIS SUMMER SO- LET'S JUST MAKE SURE WE'RE MOVING FORWARD ON A SCHEDULE THAT WORKS FOR EVERYBODY PLEASE- BECAUSE I REALLY DON'T WANT TO DEFER ACTION- ON THIS. TOUR OF FUTURE SUB COMMITTEE THAT I WILL. BE PART OF- AT SO QUESTION FOR ACOSTA CONSERVING- HAS TO DO WITH PARK BEACH SAN GRANT- AND I THINK- THE BEST WAY I CAN ASK THIS QUESTION IS- SIMPLY IS THAT IS THAT CONSIDERED A NATURE BASED. SOLUTION. I AM I AM NOT SURE I KNOW THE DETAILS OF THAT PROJECT I WOULD SAY THAT SETTLEMENT MANAGEMENT. IT IS A NATURE BASED SOLUTION- ENSURING THAT OUR BEACHES AND WETLANDS ARE NOURISHED WITH. SENTIMENT IS CRITICAL- YOU KNOW THE COMBINATION OF SEA LEVEL RISE WITH REDUCED SEDIMENT SUPPLY. IS WHAT. THREE EIGHT- THE ROCHA AND- OF OUR BEACHES AND WETLANDS SO AS MUCH AS WE CAN DO SO IN TERMS OF BENEFICIAL USE OF SETTLEMENT- WHETHER THAT'S DREDGED SEDIMENT OR SENTIMENT COMING DOWN OUR WATERSHED SEDIMENT TRAPPED BEHIND DAMS- YOU KNOW MATTEL HOW DAM FOR EXAMPLE- SO. IF YOU ARE WELL. LET'S JUST PUT THE QUESTION OUT THERE- FEEL FREE TO TAKE SOME TIME AFTER THIS HEARING- TO REPORT BACK TO OUR STAFF BUT I THINK THAT THERE'S SOME- I DON'T OF CONCERN IS THE RIGHT WORD BUT- OF SOME LEVEL OF ANALYSIS THAT STAFF WOULD LIKE TO DO. ON THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE SO- I'LL ASK YOU TO BE IN AND TOUCH- WE JUST SAY. I WOULD JUST SAY REMEMBER DURABILITY I MEAN AMY DID A GREAT JOB OF EXPLAINING THE NEED AND EVERYTHING BUT DURABILITY IS ALSO COMPLAIN ABOUT AS WELL SO IF IT'S JUST A- NO IT CANNOT ON THE DETAILS THE PROJECT AND- AND- AND OBVIOUSLY WE'LL LOOK INTO THAT. YOU KNOW IF IT'S IF IT'S JUST A BEACH REPLENISHMENT PROJECT THAT'S GONNA LAST YEAR AND A HALF THAT THAT'S NOT REALLY A NATURE BASED SOLUTION THAT'S- THAT'S AN ECONOMIC SOLUTION. ON INSTEAD OF JUST. THE FOX IS THERE HAS TO SOME DEGREE OF DOORBELL THAT. M. I THANK YOU A- BOTH OF THOSE RESPONSES- AND I THINK THAT- THAT. KIND OF DISCUSSION IS WHAT UNDERLIES WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY IS THE KIND OF DISCUSSION AND DIALOGUE THAT NEEDS TO BE HAPPENING BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE- AND THE ASSEMBLY SO APPRECIATE THAT AND- LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING IN THE NEAR FUTURE. MORE OF- ABOUT THESE PLANS ELECTRIC WITH THAT UNLESS ANYONE ELSE HAS QUESTIONS WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUES NUMBER TWO AND- WE'LL HEAR FIRST FROM LIVES OF FROM THE ALEJO ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MUSEUM GRANT PROGRAM. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS. I'M HELEN CRISTINA THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO LAST YEAR THE BUDGET APPROPRIATED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO THE CALIFORNIA CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL ENDOWMENT AND I NEVER HEARD THAT AFTER RESOURCES AGENCY AND I WAS REALLY TO PROVIDE GRANTS TO MUSEUMS AND CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS AND ADD YOUR AGENDA MENTIONS OUR UNDERSTANDING. LEGISLATURE INTENDED TO HELP ASSIST THE AND THE CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS THAT- HAD BEEN HARMED BY KOBE NINETEEN- SO THE BUDGET PRIORITIZE TRAINING. THAT HAD BEEN SEVERELY IMPACTED BY. WELL AS- THAT SERVE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY STUDENTS I'M SO WE DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC COMMENTS THIS TIME AND WE DO THINK THIS IS A VERY- HELPFUL INVALUABLE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO GET AN UPDATE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ON THE STATUS OF THOSE FINES- AND- THE PROCESS THAT THEY'RE USING FOR GETTING THOSE FIND OUT TO MAKE SURE THAT- THOSE INSTITUTIONS ARE GETTING THE FUNDS THAT- BUT THEY WERE EXPECTING IN A TIMELY MANNER. THANK YOU THANK EARLY AGREE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PROGRAM AND- IT SOUNDS LIKE WE'LL BE GETTING SOME ADDITIONAL. DETAIL FROM- MISTER CASH. YEAH BRIAN DASCHLE NATURAL RESOURCES THINGS LET FAR FOR INCLUDE THE FACT MILLION MUSEUM GROUNDS THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO BUDGET. IN FOR PRIORITY THE FOR MUSIC THEY SIMPLY SEVERE AFFECTED BY CO CANISTERS HISTORIC UNDERSTOOD COMMUNITIES WELL. WE REALLY WE WERE THE OF THESE FOR FROM AND SO FAR THIS FISCAL YEAR WE'VE- DRAFTING GUIDELINES AND REALLY THEM OUT- FOR PUBLIC COMMENT IN OCTOBER- WE RECEIVED A LOT OF COMMENTS BACK- NOT ONLY FROM THE PUBLIC BUT ALSO FROM OUR BOARD MEMBERS WE HAVE A COUPLE NEW BOARD MEMBERS FROMTHE ASSEMBLY. AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THEIR WORK CAN. AND- IN THEIR COMMENTS- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE CHANGED WHEN WE HELD OUR OUR BOARD MEETING TO SOLICIT COMMENTS- FROM THE BOARD IN THE PUBLIC ON. THE GUIDELINES WAS TO MODIFY THE DEFINITION OF THE MUSEUM SO THAT IT WOULD REACH MORE ORGANIZATIONS SO THAT THESE FUNDS THAT ARE REALLY NEEDED COULD BE GOING OUT TO MORE ORGANIZATIONS- THE- MEETING. IN NOVEMBER TOLD THE BOARD MEETING TO RECEIVE PUBLIC COMMENTS- WE PUT OUT THE FINAL GUIDELINES IN JANUARY- AND APPROVED BY THE BOARD I'M CURRENTLY WE'RE REACHING OUT- I KNOW ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WAS HOW ARE WE REACHING OUT TO THESE COMMUNITIES TO HELP THEM. AND HELP THEM APPLY. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE. FIVE VERTICAL VIRTUAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WORKSHOPS THAT WE'RE DOING- WE'VE ALREADY DONE TO AND THEY'LL BE THREE MORE NEXT WEEK. SEN- THROUGH THE HOUSE OF. A COUPLE OF OUR MEMBERS- WE'RE REACHING OUT TO NEW- MATTER RECEIVED FUNDING FROM THIS FOR. AND REACHING OUT TO- THEY TELL ASSOCIATION MUSEUMS TO FIND- ADDITIONAL ORGANIZATIONS- SO THAT THEY CAN ALSO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM MARCH ELEVENTH.

AND THEN WE'LL DO FIELD VISITS BETWEEN JUNE AND AUGUST AND THEN- FINA EVALUATIONS WILL HAPPEN IN THE FALL AND WE SHOULD BE MAKING- FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS ARE APPROVING RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE FALL. OF THIS YEAR. SO WE- WE DO REALLY APPRECIATE THE FUNDING AND WE'RE WORKING AS HARD AS WE CAN. TO ACHIEVE THAT BALANCE IN GETTING THE FUNDS OUT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE BUT ALSO- IN DEVELOPING A PROGRAM MAKING SURE THAT. WE CAN REACH ALL THE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED TO RECEIVE THIS FUNDING. TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS JUST ONE QUICK QUESTION COULD COULD YOU ELABORATE A LITTLE MORE LIKE YOU'RE SPENDING TWO AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS TRYING TO HIRE STAFF OF THIS PROGRAM COULD YOU. ELABORATE ON THAT. WE'VE ALREADY HIRED WE ALREADY HAVE STAFF FOR THE PROGRAM AND WE ARE MOVING- AND THAT AND THEY'VE BEEN HIRED AND ARE WORKING ON THE PROGRAM ALREADY. THOSE FUNDS WERE SET ASIDE FOR FUNDING THE STAFF THAT WE HAVE WORKING ON THE PROGRAM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. GREAT OF THE WILL TAKE US TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE- THANK YOU CHAIR CASH OF. ISSUE THREE IS THE CALIFORNIA CULTURAL AN ART INSTALLATION IN PARKS PROGRAM AND- THE L. A. O. HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. SURE WE DO- HELEN CRISTINA GAM AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO THIS PROPOSAL WOULD PROVIDE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO FIND ART INSTALLATIONS IN BOTH STATE AND LOCAL PARKS I KNOW CRAZINESS THESE ARE INSTALLATIONS ARE INTENDED TO REFLECT THE PARKS IS. OF LOCAL CULTURAL HERITAGE AS WELL AS AN ACTIVITY TO NATURAL RESOURCES. I UNDERSTAND YOU THAT MONEY OF THE FACT THAT THE MAIN FOCUS OF THE RECEIPT- SUPPORT NEEDS ART AND SO RATHER THAN REPLACING. AN OUTDATED EXHIBITS. I ANYTHING FIVE. VISUAL- KINDS OF- OTHER OTHER TYPES OF VISUAL- EXHIBITS AS WELL AS INTO SIGNS IN THIS OF THINGS. I THINK THIS TIME- I MEAN COME IN IT REALLY IS THAT THERE'S NOT LOT OF EACH ON THIS PROPOSAL PARK HAVEN'T YET IDENTIFY FOR- THE NUMBER THAT WOULD BE IN. THE NEW TAPES THAT INSTALLATION WOULD BE. ON THIS YEAR IT WOULD TO PARKS VERSUS LOCAL PARK. AND THIS IS MADE IT HARD TO A TO WHETHER FIFTY WEATHER THAT THE OF FUNDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE IN THE. I OR WHETHER WE WOULD LIKE TO. PRIORITIZEEVERYTHING- WITHIN THE BUDGET SO- OUR RECORD IS REALLY JUST. I DEPARTMENT PROVIDE IMAGES DETAIL ON ITS WE UNDERSTAND IT DOES INTO TO GO TO SCHOOL PUBLIC PROCESS TO HELP INFORM. WE THINK THAT THE- AS MUCH AS- WITH YOUR HELP OLDER TO THE COMING THING WE'VE HEARD. AND THEN- IN THIS HEARING BUT THEY IT'S- IT'S VERY IT'S VERY I THINK HE AND VERY HELPFUL FOR THE LARGEST TO HAVE MUCH DETAIL POSSIBLE RELIEVE THE DECISION MAKING. AUSTIN THAT THAT MINISTERS NOT HAD A CHANCE THAT IS WHAT. THANK YOU L. A. NEXT TO WILL. DIRECTOR CAN TERO. TO ADD CHAIRMAN BERS MANY IS AMONG LOOKING THAN DIRECTOR OF DEPARTMENT PARTS OR AND THANK YOU THIS OP. TO PRESENT THE CULTURAL AND IS TO AND BY CHAIN PROPOSED THE REQUEST YOU KNOW ONE TIME NON FIFTY DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND FOR A CALL IN OUR INSTEAD IN PRO TO AND IN. STATE AND LOCAL STATE PARKS WILL BE WITH ARE GOING TO SAY SO AS CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL AND NONPROFITS TO DEVELOP ART INSTALLATIONS AND PROGRAMS AND PARKS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. THIS IS A OPPORTUNITY TO REFRESH WE ENVISION AND RE ENTER REENERGIZE PARKS INTERPRETATION EDUCATION AND CULTURAL RESOURCES PROGRAMS- AND- WE SEE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS JUST AN EXTRAORDINARY OPPORTUNITY. NOW DOORS FOR ALL INITIATIVE FOCUSES EFFORTS TO CREATE MEANINGFUL CONNECTIONS AND GREATER RELEVANCY TO ALL PEOPLE THROUGH PARKS CALIFORNIA'S. IN THEIR PROGRAMS THE CALIFORNIA CULTURAL OR INSTALLATION PROGRAM INVEST IN THE PROGRAMMING OPERATE OUR STATE AND LOCAL PARKS. TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO IMPROVING PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT WITH CALIFORNIA'S RICH HISTORY CULTURAL HERITAGE AND CERTAINLY MANY OF THE PRIORITIES AT THE END THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS ADDRESSING THROUGH OTHER PROGRAMS. SUCH AS CLIMATE CHANGE AND- DESPITE SUSTAINABILITY AND ADAPTATION TO THE WORLD THAT WE ARE IT. IN THE MIDDLE OF ART FEATURES A PROMINENT PLACE IN PARKS PROGRAMMING AS A TRUE EXPRESSION OF CULTURAL ENGAGEMENT AND NATURAL HISTORY AND UNDERSTANDING. TOPICS A LITERACY AROUND ISSUES AS I SAT AROUND RESILIENCE AND SUSTAINABILITY CAN ALSO BE EFFECTIVELY. DELIVERED THROUGH THIS PROGRAM. THE DEPARTMENT OR TO BUILD. WITH THE SPECTRUM OF PARTNERS INCLUDING TRIBAL NATIONS TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL PEOPLE TO EXPERIENCE THE INHERENTLY VALUABLE CULTURAL AND THAT ARE CORE FUNCTION OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS. ASIAN AND SYSTEM. IT IS OUR JOB TO INTERPRET THE HISTORY AND CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE TREASURED SPACES IN CALIFORNIA AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO TELLING A THOROUGH AND INCLUSIVE A COMPLETE HISTORY OF THE STATE PROVIDED A MORE INCLUSIVE NARRATION CAN BE ACHIEVED IN THE RECRUITMENT OF ARTISTS AND THE REQUISITION OF ART THAT MORE ACCURATELY AFFECT A REFLECTS CALIFORNIA'S RICH CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL HERITAGE WE WILL RECRUIT PARTNERSHIPS WITH LEADING ARTISTS WRITERS HISTORIANS AND SCIENTISTS TO JOIN IN OUR EFFORTS ACROSS THE STATE IN THIS ENDEAVOR. A RECENT EXAMPLE INCLUDES THE OPENING OF A NEW PUBLIC GATHERING AREA AT OLD TOWN SAN DIEGO STATE HISTORIC PARK. ANDTHAT NEW AREA IS CALLED REPAY T. PICA MAY MOVE A CLOCK WHICH TRANSLATES FROM KUWAIT TO ENGLISH AS THE LAND OF THE FIRST PEOPLE. STATE PARKS WORK WITH KHAMENEI'S ELDERS AND ARTISTS TO DEVELOP EXHIBITS AND ART INSTALLATIONS WHICH HONOR THE CULTURE OF THE COMING. AND THEIR INTERNAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SAN DIEGO RIVER AND OLD TOWN SAN DIEGO. AT LOS ANGELES STATE HISTORIC PARK THE PUBLIC ART AND MONUMENTS PROGRAM CONTAINS ARTWORKS THAT LIVE IN THE PARK YEAR ROUND TO ENGAGE THE PUBLIC IN THE CULTURAL HERITAGE OF LOS ANGELES. AND THE HISTORY OF THAT REGION. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR CONSIDER OF THIS REQUEST BOTH MYSELF AND MY STAFF DR LESLIE HARTZELL ARE HERE TO ANSWER ANY SPEC SPECIFIC QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE. IT ALSO LIKE TO SAY THAT THROUGH THESE PROGRAMMES ON HOW WE CAN ADDRESS ISSUES SUCH AS THE GOALS OF THIRTY BY THIRTY CLIMATE CHANGE ACCESS AND AGAIN ALL OF THIS REALLY IS ABOUT ENGAGING THE PUBLIC FULLY. NOT ONLY IN THEIR LOCAL AND STATE PARKS BUT ALSO IN THE ISSUES THAT WE AS A STATE FACE. IMMEDIATELY THANK YOU. THANK YOU WHAT DOES- THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE HAVE ANY. COMMENTS TO ADD. A GOOD MORNING CHAIR THIS IS GUSTAVO MEDRANO WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE DON'T HAVE ANY FORMAL PRESENTATION BEFORE AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I CERTAINLY AGREE THAT- THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY OPPORTUNITY- AND THAT'S AS FAR AS I KNOW FIRST- FOR RECREATION PARKS WHICH LEADS ME TO MY- FIRST QUESTION AND I WANT TO BE AS SENSITIVE AS POSSIBLE HERE- IN ASKING THE QUESTION- BUT- THE FUNDING. OF ART INSTALLATIONS OR THE- OF DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF ART INSTALLATIONS. DOESN'T STRIKE ME AS BEING AN CANADA IN THE WHEEL HOUSE OF UP A STATE PARKS AND WE HAVE AN ARTS COUNCIL THAT YOU KNOW. THIS IS THIS IS WHAT THEY DO SO- I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND- A- YOU KNOW WHY WHY WERE- BEING ENCOURAGED TO ADOPT THIS PROPOSAL AS IT'S STRUCTURED- AND YOU KNOW PERHAPS I'M MISSING SOMETHING IN THE ARTS COUNCIL ACTUALLY IS INVOLVED IN THIS. IF I COULD ANSWER THAT A GERMAN BLOOM SEVEN OKAY ARMAND THE- GUN SO I JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT THE DEPARTMENT DOES INTEND TO PARTNER WITH THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL AS WE DEVELOP AND ADMINISTER THIS PROGRAM. GIVEN THE ICONIC LANDSCAPE AND CULTURAL SITES AND PARKS AND OUR FOCUS ON INTERPRETATION HISTORIC STORYTELLING AND CULTURAL RELEVANCY OF PARKS- CALIFORNIA'S PARKS THERE'S ALREADY A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND CULTURAL RELEVANCY WORK UNDERWAY AT STATE PARKS. DID MR SHIN- HERE FEELS THAT IT'S APPROPRIATE TO HOUSE THE PROGRAM AT THE STATE PARKS THE PARTNERSHIP WOULD BE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE STRENGTHS OF BOTH ORGANIZATIONS AND THIS PROGRAM CREATES A FORCE MULTIPLIER FOR BOTH ACCESS AND CULTURAL RELEVANCY. X. REPRESENTS THE AND HIS IS THAT COMMUNITY. ARE THERE LOW. AT A COLLABORATION ON ON THIS ENDEAVOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA ARTS CULTURE WILL CERTAINLY BE A BENEFIT FOR BOTH OF US IN- AND LEADING THIS EFFORT. WE EXPECT THAT- THE GUIDANCE FROM THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL WITH THERE ARE PROGRAMS IN- CULTURAL DISTRICTS- A ON THEIR CREATIVE CORE PROGRAM WILL REALLY HELP INFORM THE DISTRIBUTION OF GRANT FUNDS SPECIFICALLY TO LOCAL PARKS FOR INSTANCE. OKAY WILL OF THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING THAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION- I THINK THAT- SOME OF THAT WAS NOT KNOWN TO OUR STAFF WHICH IS YOU KNOW KIND OF ONE OF THE ISSUES SO IT'S BECOMING A THEME A HUB IN THE- IN IN OUR HEARING TODAY BUT WE DO HAVE TIME TO- OF- TO DISCUSS THIS MORE SO THAT'S A GOOD THING AND I'M- GLAD TO HEAR THAT THE ARTS COUNCIL. IN SOME FASHION IS GOING TO BE PARTNERING. WITH PARKS IT SOUNDS VERY APPROPRIATE TO MAKE- IS THERE CURRENTLY A PLAN FOR ALLOCATING A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY TO LOCAL PARKS VERSUS STATE PARKS. I'M I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THAT IF I MAY UM. WE WERE LOOKING AT THIS IN TERMS OF- COMMUTING CASEMENT AS DRIVING THE PROCESS FOR DETERMINING THE SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF FUNDS THAT WOULD BE ALLOCATED I GOT BETWEEN STATE PARK- PROJECTS AND LOCAL PARKS ON THAT WILL HELP INFORM EXACTLY HOW MUCH MONEY SO AT THIS POINT THOUGH I- AND THE DISSIPATING FROM OUR ANALYSIS OF THE MAXIMUM SIZE FOR LOCAL PARK GRAMS. AS I SAID WILL BE DETERMINED TO THE COMMUNICATION PROCESS BUT BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE IN MY TWENTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AND DURING EXHIBIT- DEVELOPMENT WITHIN STATE PARKS ITSELF- WE EXPECT THE LARGEST GRANT AMOUNT TO BE ABOUT TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WE WANT TO ENSURE ROBUST COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PROCESS FOR COMMITTEE BEFORE WE COMMIT TO THAT. WE'RE ALSO ANTICIPATING TO ANSWER THE ALEJO'S QUESTION ARE THAT WE WOULD HAVE APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED ART INSTALLATIONS. OF THROUGH THIS PROGRAM MOST WOULD BE- SMALLER DOLLAR GRANTS THAT WOULD GO TO LOCAL PARKS- FOR PROJECTS THAT MIGHT BE A MORE RELATED IS THAT DIRECTOR HAD MENTIONED TO US. OF OUR- INSTALLATIONS THAT MIGHT BE A TEMPORARY NATURE THAT COULD BE- ARTISTS IN RESIDENCE KIND OF PROGRAMS- THEY COULD BE A SPOKEN WORD ABOUT- EVENTS OTHER BRICK REALLY COMMUNITIES TOGETHER AND THOSE WOULD BE- SOME OF THE SMALLER DOLLAR AMOUNTS THAT WOULD REALLY HELP BUILD WITH THE LOCAL CARE PROGRAMS WE ALREADY DO FIND THE CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF. OF WORK TO BUILD AND ENHANCE LOCAL PARKS AND THIS WOULD BE A WAY TO ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY EVEN FURTHER NOT JUST WITH THE CREATION OF THOSE PARKS AND IMPROVEMENTS IN THOSE PARTS ARE REALLY BRINGING COMMUNITIES TOGETHER THROUGH THIS MEDIA ON A LARGER DOLLAR AMOUNTS OF. WOULD BE- OR SOME OF THE MORE. PART ART IN. WERE THE THOSE WITH- BE FOCUSED MORE STATE PARKS WHERE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THOSE INTO THE FUTURE- SO THAT THEY CAN BE. SUSTAINED AND- IF AND MAINTAIN BASICALLY. I WOULD LIKE I'D LIKE TO ADD SOMETHING TO WHAT YOU HAVE JUST SAID LESLIE THANK YOU AND THAT IS THAT SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE STATE PARKS HAS SUCCESSFULLY DELIVERED GRANT FUNDING TO COMMUNITIES WHICH DEMONSTRATE THE HIGHEST NEEDS ARM OR LEVELS OF NEED WHICH IS INDICATED BY THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHY PLACES INDEX AND ALSO THE STATEWIDE COMPREHENSIVE OUTDOOR RECREATION PLANNER SCORED AND WE USE THOSE TOOLS TO ADDRESS ON MEET. UNMET NEEDS FOR LOCAL PARKS IN THIS CASE ART INSTALLATIONS AND THESE ARE THE KINDS OF TOOLS THAT WE WILL BRING TO THE TABLE AS WE WORK WITH THE ARTS COUNCIL AND AS I KNOW IS- YOU KNOW THE END IS I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT JUST LAST YEAR OUR OFFICE OF GRANTS TO LOCAL SERVICES- IT MADE DECISIONS ON FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF INVESTMENTS IN UNDERSERVED PARK POOR COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND THOSE FUNDS WITH ITS THE LEGISLATURE SUPPORT ACTUALLY HAVE CREATED ARE GOING TO CREATE FIFTY NEW PARKS IN COMMUNITIES THAT DO NOT HAVE EASY ACCESS TO OUTDOOR AREAS AND WILL ALSO- HELP FIND- HI. A HUNDRED AND TWELVE- OR SIXTY TWO RATHER STAY PARK- LOCAL PARKS WHO. AND SO I THINK THAT THE PART BE STATE PARKS IN THE ARTS COUNCIL IN THE COMING YEAR I WILL BE VERY POWERFUL IN BRINGING. MUCH NEEDED MESSAGING AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT OF ACROSS THE STATE- I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT DURING THIS. PANDEMIC ALL OF THESE PUBLIC SPACES HAVE SEEN UNPRECEDENTED VISITATION DEMAND AND SO I THINK THAT WE I KNOW THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH. THE ARTS COUNCIL OF AND OTHER COMMUNITY GROUPS TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DELIVERING ESSENTIAL MESSAGES ON EVERYTHING FROM HOW YOU DEAL WITH HEAT EVENTS AND- IN OTHER. WORDS THAT WE ARE ALL DOING THE TATE TO IMPROVE A CALIFORNIA. AND MAKE CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA FOR A LONG. THANK YOU ARAMBULA OF THE THINGS I LEARNED TO- IN- ALMOST FOURTEEN YEARS OF SERVICE- AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT- WHERE I HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO BE ABLE TO FIND A FAIR AMOUNT OF PUBLIC ART- IS THAT IT HAS TO BE MAINTAINED OVER TIME- IF THERE'S NO FUNDING FOR MAINTENANCE THAT- ARTWORK AND- A QUICKLY. DETERIORATE BE DEFACED- AND- NO LONGER REALLY PROVIDE THE KIND OF ENJOYMENT THAT WE- AND INSPIRATION THAT WE EXPECT FROM OUR- SO- IS THERE GOING TO BE A PLAN- FOR MAINTAINING. THESE ART INSTALLATIONS AND- IN THE CASE OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IS GRANT FUNDING GOING TO INCLUDE- SOMETHING FOR UPKEEP NOT JUST FOR THE INSTEAD. OF PRODUCTION AND INSTALLATION OF THE ART. MY OUT. GO AHEAD LESLIE. THANK YOU ANSWER THAT ONE- YEAH THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE A KEENLY AWARE OF THAT IT IS AN ISSUE THAT'S BEEN IDENTIFIED- AND CERTAINLY THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL- OF WHAT'S VERY FORTHRIGHT ABOUT THIS CONCERN OF FOR MAINTENANCE AND THAT'S WHY I THINK WE WERE DISCUSSING THE FACT THAT WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO HAVE TO BE LOOKING FOR MORE CREATIVE WAYS TO FIND THE GRANTS FOR THE LOCAL PARKS. ON WE HAVE SOME REALLY GREAT MODELS OUT THERE BOTH AT LOCAL PARKS AND WHAT'S BEEN DONE AT LA STATE HISTORIC PARK WHERE COMMUNITY GROUPS COME TOGETHER AND THEY% ARE DEVELOPED THERE- ARTISTIC PROGRAMS AND THEY DO THEIR INSTALLATIONS AND THEY RUN FOR A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME EONS THEY ARE CAPTURED IN FILM AND VIDEO SHARED ON SOCIAL MEDIA- WEBSITES DEVELOPED AROUND THOSE COMMUNITY- ART INSTALLATIONS- WHETHER THEY'RE SPOKEN WORD OR- CREATIVE INSTALLATIONS HAT POP UP AROUND IT- THAT ALSO HAVE. OTHER WAYS TO ENGAGE SO WE'RE REALLY SEEING THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR COMMUNITIES TO DEVELOP REALLY CREATIVE WAYS TO BRING THEM COME TOGETHER HAVE THESE EXPERIENCES AT THESE PARKS AND THEN CURATED- MORE THROUGH- I WOULD SAY A MEDIA PLATFORMS IN THE LONG RUN EVEN IF THEY ARE ARE BROUGHT IN AND WE'RE HOPING TO IT ENGAGES COMMUNITIES LIKE IF THEY HAVE POETRY PROGRAMS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT THAT THEY- ARE SUGGESTING THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO DO. THAT OF THOSE COULD BE THINGS THAT THEY WOULD BUILD THAT COMMUNITY TIES AND THEN CARRY ON INTO THE FUTURE THIS. COULD BE A CATALYST FOR THOSE KINDS OF ACTIVITIES. THANK YOU. CAN YOU PROVIDE US WITH AN UPDATE ON THE FUNDING FROM LAST YEAR FOR OUTDOOR ACCESS FOR ALL. AND A PERHAPS YOU CAN INCLUDE- ANY OTHER SUCCESSES OR CHALLENGES- THAT YOU EXPERIENCE IN EXPANDING. ACCESS DURING POPE IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT QUESTION. YES WE ALREADY ROLLED OUT THE FIRST OF THREE PROGRAMS IN NOVEMBER AND THAT IS SOMETHING CALLED THE ADVENTURE PASS WE ARE FOURTH GRADERS CAN GO ONLINE AND REGISTER FOR A FREE PASS. IT'S ACTUALLY TO DIGITAL PASSED THE DEBATE GET AND IN GIVES FREE ACCESS TO THAT FOURTH QUARTER AND THEIR FAMILIES TO NINETEEN PARKS IN CALIFORNIA AND THEY SPAN CALIFORNIA FROM. HUMBLE ALL THE WAY DOWN TO SAN DIEGO. AND WE'VE ALREADY HAD I THINK IT'S- ELEVEN THOUSAND FOURTH GRADERS REGISTER FOR THE PROGRAM AND GET THEIR FREE PASSES SORRY WHAT WAS THAT NUMBER AGAIN. ELEVEN YEAH GREAT AND UP IN THE PROGRAM IS BEING ACTIVELY USED- AND SO IT'S A IT'S A GREAT JUMP START AND WE DO THINK THAT THIS IS A MODEL PROGRAM- AND WE'VE ACTUALLY- IN IN THESE NINETEEN PARKS WE'VE HIRED AND WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF HIRING OF INTERPRETIVE STAFF THEY'LL ACTUALLY FOCUS ON THE DELIVERY AND DEVELOPMENT OF PROGRAMS- TO THAT DEMOGRAPHIC OF FAMILIES WITH A FOURTH GRADER AND- THE OTHER TWO PROGRAMS THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE ROLLING OUT- THE NEXT PROGRAM IS GONNA ROLL OUT IS THE SOMETHING CALLED A LIBRARY PARK PASS. WHICH IS WE WILL BE DISTRIBUTING PARK PASSES TO VIRTUALLY ALL THE LIBRARIES IN CALIFORNIA WHERE STUDENTS CAN GO TO THE LIBRARY AND CHECK OUT A PARK PASS FOR A WEEK AND THAT WILL ALLOW THAT STUDENTS TAKE THEIR FAMILY TO ANY STATE PARK FILLED THAT USES THE STATE PARKS WHERE THERE'S AN ENTRANCE FEE- TO GET INTO THE PARK FOR FREE AND THAT PROGRAM IS MODELED AFTER A PROGRAM- WHICH ACTUALLY WAS THE MARIN COUNTY A FEW YEARS AGO OUT WHERE THAT PART PASSED BECAME. THE THAT LIBRARY PARK PASS ACCESS WAS THE SECOND MOST CHECKED OUT ITEM- IN THE COUNTY LIBRARIES HERE AND ME IN MARIN AND SO WE DO KNOW OR BELIEVE THAT THIS IS GONNA BE A REALLY WONDERFUL ACCESS TO THAT GOAL A DEMOGRAPHIC AND WE ALSO ARE WORKING WITH THE STATE LIBRARIAN AND OUR EXPECTATION AND OUR EFFORTS REALLY AREN'T PART WITH LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIANS TO HELP DELIVER THE MESSAGES AROUND THE VALUES OF PARKS FOR BOTH MENTAL AND PHYSICAL BASICALLY SOCIAL HEALTH SERVICE REALLY I THINK IT TO BE A VERY POWERFUL IMPACT. AND AGAIN WE'RE GOING TO ROLL THAT OUT- I THINK IN EARLY APRIL. AND THEN THE- THE THIRD PROGRAM THE WE- IMPLEMENTING IS WITH THE PROBLEMS. THE EDA. N. RECIPIES. OF SO. SUPPORT AND CAL INFORMATION THAT IS A LINK WHERE THEY CAN SIGN UP AND ALSO GET A FREE PASS IF YOU'RE ELIGIBLE FOR A NUMBER OF THE- SERVICES FROM- THIS IS SERVICE DEPARTMENT. AND THAT PROGRAMS GOING TO BE ROLLED OUT IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS AND WE EXPECT THAT THOSE THREE PROGRAMS ARE REALLY GOING TO HIT A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA. N. O. ONLY- REALLY A NEW OPEN THE WORLD TO THOSE COMMUNITIES AND I WILL ALSO SAY THAT THIS YEAR. ALTHOUGH HOW WELL WILL THIS YEAR WITH THE GRANTS PROGRAM THROUGH OUR OFFICER GRANTS LOCAL SERVICES- WHICH WILL BE ROLLED OUT FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN LOCAL GRANTS. WE'RE DOING SEVERAL THINGS THAT WE DID SEVERAL THINGS THERE ONE OF THEM IS- WE'RE MAKING SURE THAT ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE ARE AWARE OF THOSE PARKS THAT HAVE BEEN CREATED IN THEIR DISTRICTS BECAUSE OF. THROUGH THE SPONSONS SIXTY FIVE EIGHT AND ALSO WE'RE WORKING WITH- WHEN WE DID THE ROLL OUT THIS YEAR- IT WAS A PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT THE GOVERNOR FOR THE- PARTNER JOINING YET THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AS DID THE SECRETARY OF RESOURCES AND THE UNDER. SECRETARY OF RESOURCES WE ACTUALLY HAD A ZOOM CALL WITH ALL THE COMMUNITY RECIPIENTS AND IT WAS REALLY ONE OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY EXCHANGES WHERE- COMMUNITIES THAT WERE RECEIVING THESE FUNDS LITERALLY N. ARE EXPRESSING WHAT THAT WAS GOING TO MEAN TO THEIR COMMUNITIES. YOU LITERALLY TALKED ABOUT THE CIVIC ENGAGEMENT IN THE CIRCLE OF VOTERS APPROVING FUNDS FOR PROPOSITIONS AND SUCH AND THEN THAT GOING TO. THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND THE LEGISLATURE FOR APPROVAL AND THEN PARKS WORKING WITH COMMUNITIES TO DELIVER THAT SUPPORT AND IT WAS REALLY AN EXTRAORDINARY EXPERIENCE OF SEEING THE VALUE. OF A COUPLE THINGS ONE OF THEM THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. AND THE OTHER IS WE ARE WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE COMMUNITIES KNOW THAT THESE FUNDS COMING TO THEIR COMMUNITIES ARE BEING DELIVERED THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE'S EFFORT TO THE GOVERNOR'S. EFFORTS AND THROUGH THE STATE PARK SO IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A MARKETING EFFORT TO REALLYLET MORE COMMUNITIES NO CALIFORNIA THAT THE STATE PARK SYSTEM IS BEARS. AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT WE'RE REALLY FOCUSED ON ACCESS FOR ALL IN I AM VERY PROUD OF THE TEAM THAT I GET TO WORK WITH HIM PARKS AND CERTAINLY- WITH THE LEGISLATORS IN YOUR SUPPORT. THOSE PROGRAMS SPARE OF OUTDOOR ACCESS ALL WHICH I THINK IS- A GREAT PROGRAM. IT'S LIKE YOU- OF MAKING SICK PROGRESS AND- MOVING FORWARD ON A NUMBER OF FRONTS- BUT IN IN THE SPIRIT OF- OF- ACCESS FOR ALL. HAS THE ADMINISTRATION CONSIDERED A GRANT PROGRAM TO FUND- OF PLACE STRUCTURES FOR ALL OF THE CHILDREN OF ALL ABILITIES- AT STATE OR LOCAL PARKS. AGAIN THIS QUESTION IS INFORMED BY MY EXPERIENCE IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHERE WE WERE FORTUNATE ENOUGH IN SANTA MONICA TO BE ABLE TO- FUND THE- OF PLAY PARKS- WITH- APPARATUS AND- CLIMBING STRUCTURES AND THE LIKE FOR. ALL ABILITIES- CHILDREN OF ALL ABILITIES- AND THEY'VE BEEN. INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL- I'D BE INTERESTED IN KNOWING IF THERE IS A- GRANT. PROGRAM- I IF NOT- IT'S TIME FOR US TO CREATE. WELL OUR OFFICE OF GRANTS AND LOCAL SERVICES EVERY YEAR DELIVERS WORKSHOPS WITH COMMUNITIES TO GET THEM TO MEET WITH THEIR COMMUNITIES SO THAT THE PARKS THAT WE FUND ARE ACTUALLY PARKS ARE DESCRIBED BY THE COMMUNITIES AND THEIR NEEDS- I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK TO OUR- OFFICE OF GRANTS AND LOCAL SERVICES. MY ALL RIGHT I WILL HAVE TO FIND OUT BUT MY ASSUMPTION IS COMMUNITIES HAVE. I HOPE. HEY DOES THIS REQUEST BUT WE WILL I'LL HAVE TO FIND OUT AND GET BACK TO YOU UNLESS THERE'S SOMEONE- ON MY TEAM WHO KNOWS THE ANSWER THE SPECIFIC ANSWER TO THE. SO I WILL GET BACK TO YOU- CHAIR OKAY GREAT- I KNOW WE TYPICALLY HAVE A MEETING WE HAVEN'T HAD ONE. YET THIS YEAR BUT- WHAT WHEN WE DO PERHAPS THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN TALK ABOUT AND I. OF A GREATER DETAIL AS YOU CAN TELL I'M- VERY INTERESTED IN- SEE IF WE CAN'T DO SOMETHING THERE. AND I KNOW YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO- YOU'RE NOT AUTHORIZED TO ASK US FOR FUNDING RIGHT NOW- BUT- I NOT I'M AUTHORIZED TO DISCUSS THAT WITH YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION YOU'RE VERY WELCOME- I DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ON THIS ISSUE I'M SORRY KIND OF FOG THAT THE MICROPHONE HERE- GREAT THEN WILL- THANK GOD OUR PARTICIPANTS ON ISSUE THREE AND MOVE ON. TO ISSUE FOR- HI THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE AS WELL AND VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER ONES THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT- L. A- WOULD YOU LIKE TO. WEIGH IN ON THIS GIVE US YOUR THOUGHTS. THE CARE CHAIR AND BUSINESS UNIT THROW WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. AND SO THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED AS A HUNDRED MILLION FROM THE GENERAL FIND IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND A HUNDRED MILLION AND TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AND A TOTAL OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION OVER TWO YEARS FOR COLLEGE THEN- PLUG WELLS AND DECOMMISSION PATHOLOGY AND- HOUSE THEN I WOULD USE THE PROPOSED FUNDING TO HIRE THREE TYPES SAYS- EXTERNAL CONTRACTORS TO DO THE WORK FOR THAT. I CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT CONTRACTOR TO MANAGE THE REMEDIATION PROJECTS BACK AND A CONTRACTOR TO CONDUCT RESEARCH ON FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS THE LANDOWNER FROM- FOR THE OF THAT THEY'RE THERE TO LOG AND THE THERE IS A CONTRACT TO PLUG WELLS AND DECOMMISSION FACILITY THEY DURING THE ACTUAL. EACH WORK AND HAVE SEVERAL COMMENTS REGARDING THE THIRD- VERY WE RECKON THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER TO PROPOSE. IN CONTEXT OF THE SIGNIFICANT FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR THIS ACTIVITY AND THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR LAST ANNOUNCED CALIFORNIA IS ESTIMATED TO BE ELIGIBLE FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE POINT NINE MILLION AND THE STATE IS LIKELY TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FINDING IN THE COMING MONTHS AS- MORE FEDERAL GUIDELINES ARE RELEASED AB. AND A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE TOTAL AVAILABLE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR WILDER MEDIATION ACTIVITIES WERE REALLY HELP THE LEGISLATURE DETERMINE AND THE DEGREE TO WHICH ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING FOR THESE ACTIVITIES SUCH AS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR IT'S REALLY A PRIORITY. AND SECOND IF THE LEGISLATURE WOULD STILL LIKE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL STATE FIND YOU KNOW WE RECOMMEND THAT CONSIDERING REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF PROPOSED FUNDING ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FEDERAL FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR THESE ACTIVITIES. AND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE CURRENT WALDRON MEDIATION ACTIVITIES OVERSEEN BY CALDERON. AND IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THE DIVISION THE CAPACITY TO. SUCH A LAW AND STATE ANTI FUNDING WITHIN EXISTING RESOURCE GIVEN THAT NUMEROUS OTHER RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE- OVERSIGHT AS- AND GAS INDUSTRY. AND THE LEGISLATURE WITH LIKE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR- WON'T ET. THAT LED TO MIGHT TO CONSIDER BRIDGE TH OF FOR BY THE GOVERNOR AND TARGETING THE FINE SPECIFIC LEAD TO. AND ALLOW INTO WE- ON BY ABA. A LAN. THAT WE THE- YOU VERIFY CAN WILD LOOK AND ACCESS TO. AND THE OWNER BACK. OR Q. AND REDUCE THE AMOUNT YOU ASK FOR THE KIND OF THE MATCHING. FUNDS TO MAXIMIZE FEDERAL FUNDING. AND THIRDLY. CONSIDERING ALTERNATIVE OF FUNDING INSTEAD OF FUNDING THESE ACTIVITIES DURING THE GENERAL FUND THAT'S PROPOSED LET THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO CONTINUE FUNDING WALDRON MEDIATION ACTIVITIES WITH SPECIFIED IN ADDED THE TEST WELL GAS AD GEOTHERMAL AND MINISTRY TO FIND AND THE HAZARDOUS IDYLLWILD BEATEN AND FIND. THAT ARE CURRENTLY FUNDING SIMILAR WORK ON AND DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF FUNDING THE LEGISLATURE DECIDES TO PERFORATE FOR THE PERFECT. IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE CURRENT FUND BALANCE IN THE SENSE. THAT THAT THAT THAT. I IF I REMEMBER MAY REQUIRE REPORTING ON KEEP HER OUT. AND IF THE FIVE IS APPROVED WE RECOMMEND THE- ADOPT BILLING REQUIRING THAT THAT PART TO. REPORT ANNUALLY THE HAVE BEEN FULLY. ON EXPAND. NUMBER DATA A REMEDIATED FINE THE WAR AND WANT TO FIVE BENEFIT ARE THE ROMAN MEDICLINIC COMMITTEE. I ADDITIONAL FOR ON THE COST AND BENEFITS OF THE WILL REDUCE WORK THAT BY CAL AND WOOD BE HOW. FOR THE- HERE I'M DETERMINE WHETHER AND IDEA. FUNDS FOR THE ACTIVITIES IT'S WARM IN THE FUTURE. AND THAT CONCLUDES OUR CAR AND WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE A QUESTIONS AFTER ALL THE THIRD COMMENT. THANK YOU ENTER FROM THE- OF. I THINK WE THE- STATE OIL AND GAS SUPERVISOR WITH US TODAY MISTER AND TOOK. I DIDN'T GOOD MORNING JOURNALISM- COMMITTEE MEMBERS- CAN HEAR ME OKAY YEP PERFECTLY THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING YES THIS- PROPOSAL WILL BE FUNDING TO MITIGATE THE STATE'S A- POTENTIAL LIABILITY AND HELP ADVANCE THE CARRIAGE OF THE EFFORT TO FOCUS ON PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL. PROTECTION I DON'TTHINK THERE'S A HUNDRED MILLION A PROPOSAL FOR FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE WITH THE AND IT'S JUST A HUNDRED MILLION BECAUSE YOU'RE TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR THAT WOULD BE ONE TIME FROM GENERAL FUND TO PLUG AND ABANDON. IN ONE AS WELL AS IN THE COMMISSION ASSOCIATE FACILITIES THAT COULD POSE A DANGER TO LIFE HEALTH WATER QUALITY WILDLIFE AND NATURAL RESOURCES. IF LEFT UNDER MEDIA THESE WELLS ARE SOCIAL ASSOCIATED FACILITIES CAN CONTAMINATE WATERWAYS SOIL SERVE AS A SOURCE OF- CLIMBING AIR POLLUTANTS. THAT CAN PRESENT A PHYSICAL HAZARD TO PEOPLE WILDLIFE- THEY MADE LEAGUE OIL ON THE GROUND- THE JUNCTION FLUIDS FORMATION INTO NEARBY. UNDERGROUND SOURCES OF DRINKING WATER AND SURFACE WATERS AND ALSO RELEASE METHANE HYDROGEN SULFIDE AND OTHER GASES. INTO THE GROUNDWATER AND ATMOSPHERE- BASED ON THE NUMBERS- PROVIDED BY CAL JAM. THAT WOULD NO RESPONSIBLE OPERATOR FOR. UP TO FIFTY THREE HUNDRED WELLS AND THE AVERAGE COST IMPLEMENTED WELLS AND TWO HUNDRED MILLION WHAT WOULD NOT- COULD BE FULLY EXPENDED IN MAKING IMPORTANT IMPACT- IT'S TO NOTE THAT. HIS OR HER. MOST CREATE- THERE HAS WASTED ON THE GROUND- AND THE RISK THROUGH THE STATE BOTH ON AND OFF. DOES CAN BY AND THEN LOT THE CANNOT BE READ THE- AND POLLUTANT. INTO THAT WAS- THERE'S A- MONEY- TO GAINED FROM THE FUN WITH MY FOR. OF THE IS STILL WE'RE STILL PLAN GUIDE FOR THE PART UNTIL- BUT A FROM. THIRTY TO NINETY MILLION DOLLARS UP AS AVAILABLE- BASED ON INCREASE SPENDING. OUR CURRENT SPENDING AMOUNTS- RIGHT NOW WOULD TAKE MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS TO ADDRESS. THE IDENTIFIED A FIFTY THREE HUNDRED WELLS- AND THIS IS UP IF WE DON'T DEAL WITH NOW WILL CONTINUE TO BE A DECADES LONG PROBLEM. WELL GAS IS GOING TO CARRYING CALIFORNIA FOR MORE THAN A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AND HE'S FUNDS WOULD BE FOR. NOT FOR KERN OPERATED BEFORE WHERE THERE'S NO VIABLE OPERATOR- OF DESERTION- AND IT'S BOTH ONSHORE AND OFFSHORE WELLS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED- HAPPY TO TAKE. ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU DOES DEPART OF FIVE. HAVE AN COMMENTS THAT. YES GOOD MORNING CHAIR THIS IS SANDRA WITH THE PER TO FIND A- I'M I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT AND YOU KNOW THE ESTIMATED NEED OF UP TO A BILLION DOLLARS. ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH UTILIZING A COMBINATION OF THE GENERAL FUND FEDERAL FUNDS AND FEE BASED FUNDS- WE CONSIDER THIS A WISE INVESTMENT OF AVAILABLE RESOURCES. WITH THE GENERAL FUND AND FEDERAL FUNDS BEING VIEWED AS COMPLEMENTARY OF EACH OTHER AND IMMEDIATELY ADDRESSES PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES. SO GIVEN THAT- THE- NUMBER OF WELLS- EXCEEDS EVEN THE FUNDING THAT- WE'RE DISCUSSING HERE TODAY WHICH WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN- A HAS BEEN ALLOCATED IN THE PAST. HOW DO YOU PRIORITIZE WHICH WELL AS PLUGGED FIRST. AT YOUR BLUES WOULD WALK A JOINT CHECK- WE'VE DONE SOME PULMONARY THREAT TO ENVIRONMENT- NEAR OR IN WATERWAYS PROXIMITY RESIDENTS- ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES IDENTIFIED IN THE CALAVERAS SCREEN- TOOL- THERE IS ALSO IN THE FEDERAL. REQUIREMENTS TO REPORT BACK IDENTIFIED PRIORITIZATION WE ALSO PLAN TO DO- EXTENSIVE PUBLIC OUTREACH OF THE STAKEHOLDERS TO GET INPUT ON- PRIORITIZATION SOME LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AVERTED REACHED OUT LIKE LOS ANGELES IN CARPINTERIA WHO HAVE LONG. THIS WELLS OF THE THEY WOULD PREFER TO BE TAKE. CARE OF SO WOULD TAKE A LOOK TOURIST PUT AS WELL THAT RESPONSE. MISTER BENNETT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TERRY BLOOM- HI I APPRECIATE- THE CONCEPT OF- HAVING ADDITIONAL GENERAL FUND DOLLARS PARTICULARLY IF WE CAN LEVERAGE MORE FEDERAL DOLLARS WITH THAT- I ALSO APPRECIATE THE L. L. A. POINTING OUT THE- QUESTIONINGTHE USE OF GENERAL FUND DOLLARS HERE- IN THIS SITUATION GIVEN THAT THERE WERE FACT WE HAVE SO MANY WELLS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN AYE- THAT WE DON'T. HAVE BEEN ABANDONED THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHO THE OWNERSHIP IS- THE OWNER WHO THE OWNERS ARE- HI SUPPORT THIS SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OUR EFFORTS BUT I WOULD LIKE TO- TRIED TO SEE IF WE SHOULD TRANSITION TO HIGHER FEES-SO THAT WE CAN MAKE US MORE SUSTAINABLE EFFORT AND NOT HAVE IT BE GENERAL FUND SUPPORTED IN THE FUTURE. AND SO- A QUESTION THAT I HAVE THIS DOES THE DEPARTMENT FEEL THAT THEY COULD SUSTAIN BECAUSE THAT'S ONE OF THE QUESTIONS FROM LA- WAS CAN YOU ACTUALLY ENGAGE IN AND- AND PROPERLY HANDLE THE INCREASED WORKLOAD AND IF YOU CAN DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU CAN SUSTAIN THAT A YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT IF WERE ABLE TO COME UP WITH A CORPORATE FUNDING FROM. CHANGES IT AND HAVING THE PEOPLE WHO ARE THE POLLUTERS AND WHO HAVE PROFITED FROM THAT POLLUTION BE THE ONES WHO ARE PAYING FOR A MORE APPROPRIATELY BE THE ONES WHO ARE PAYING FOR THE- CAPPING OF THE TWELVES AND- PLUGGING OF VISUALS. IT WAS IT WOULD WALKING GET. YES THE CHECK OF WELLS THAT WE'VE JUST BEEN RESOURCE CONSTRAINED. IN THE PAST DECADE WE'VE- PLUS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN WELLS- BUT WE'VE ONLY HAD. ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS SPENDING AUTHORITY FOR MOST LAST DECADE IT'S INCREASED THE THREE MILLION- WITH SB FORTY SEVEN IT WILL NOW GO TO FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR- BUT WE HAVE EXPERIENCE IN STATE CONTRACTING WORKING WITH. A LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WE HAVE UNIQUE AUTHORITIES OF BOTH SERVICE ACCESS AND SUBJECT OF. INFORMATION TO IMPLEMENT THIS A PART OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS- THE TEN PERCENT. CAN BE USED FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS BOTH RESEARCH STAFF BEING COST RECOVERY OUR APPROACH WE WOULD DO COST RECOVERY EVALUATIONS ON ALL LEVELS. THIS IS. A RETAIN. I BELIEVE WE CERTAINLY WOULD. HAVE THE ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT THIS PROGRAM. OF DID IT IT IS THE REGISTRATION INTERESTED IN. MODERN WELL YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO ADVOCATE IN TERMS OF LEGISLATION- WELL WITHDRAW THAT- THE BIG GETTING PART OF THAT QUESTION- I APPRECIATE THAT CHAIRMAN BLOOMS RECALL QUESTION ABOUT PRIORITIZATION OF THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IF YOU HAVE THIS MUCH UNMET NEEDS. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE GETTING MAKE MAXIMUM BAG FOR A BUCK I AM VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR A CONTRACTOR TO CONDUCT THE FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS OF LANDOWNERSHIP- AND- I WOULD LIKE TO AFTER A YEAR FIND OUT HOW AFFECTED OF THAT INVESTMENT OF TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS WAS. BECAUSE IF IT MAY BE A GREAT INVESTMENT TO BE ABLE TO FIND OUT WHO ACTUALLY HAS TE FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND WE MAY BE ABLE RECOVER. AND DRAMATICALLY EXPAND OUR EFFORTS IF WE CAN FIND WAYS TO DO THAT SO- I WOULD ASK THE DEPARTMENT CAREFULLY MONITOR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THAT SPENDING AND WHAT KIND OF DOLLAR RETURN WE GET- FOR DOING THE RESEARCH ON LAND OWNERSHIP AND FINANCIAL OBLIGATION. AS WE GO FORWARD- FROM THE- COST BENEFIT A- THAT YOU REFER TO WOULD ALSO BE SUBJECT TO BE VERY IMPORTANT FOR US. TO LOOK AT- AS WE MOVE FORWARD- THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION AND AS YOU SAID- TAKING A HUNDRED YEARS TO PLUG THESE WELLS JUSTICE IS NOT A FEASIBLE. SOLUTION TO OFFER TO THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA- WE NEED TO FIND A WAY TO- MAKE SURE WE FIND A REVENUE AND THOSE PEOPLE AGAIN THAT HAVE- PROFITED OFF TO PLAY A MAJOR ROLE HERE IN HELPING US COME UP WITH THE REVENUE WE NEED TO PLUG LEASE ABANDONED WELLS. THANK YOU. FOR MR FONG RICHARD THIS IS ANDREW ALL WITH BERMAN FINE. I JUST WANTED IT NOTE THAT- AND WE HAVE ANOTHER PROPOSAL- IMPLEMENTATION OF SB FORTY SEVEN. WHICH DOES INCLUDE SIX POSITIONS AS WELL TO DO SIMILAR WORK AND WE DO CONTINUE TO MONITOR- DEPARTMENT PROGRESS. IN THE EVENT THAT THEY MIGHT NEED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IN THE FUTURE. RIGHT BOB MR FONG AND I WILL GO BACK TO MR ABOUT. I THANK YOU CHAIR BLOOM- JUST JUST REAL QUICK CONTEXT- MAYBE IN THIS QUESTION AS TO- DIRECTOR CALL JIM- THIS IS THE FIRST TIME. THE I UNDERSTAND THAT THE GENERAL FUND HAS BEEN ASKED TO ASSIST YEARS. IS THE INDUSTRY THAT THE ENERGY INDUSTRY. PAYS A HUNDRED PERCENT- FOR REMEDIATION DO THE FEES AND EVERYTHING THAT THEY'VE DONE IS THAT CORRECT. NO THIS NOT BE THE FIRST TIME STATUS IS APPROPRIATE GENERAL FUND FOR CLEAN UP- IT INTO THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION- PLATFORM HOLLY- SOMEONE BEACH I BELIEVE THEY GET BETWEEN FOUR AND SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN JOURNAL PLANNED. FOR THEIR LEGACY WELL ABANDONMENT THAT CYNTHIA THAILAND'S IN OFFSHORE THREE MILES OUT OKAY BUT IT BUT I DID I GUESS THE BROADER POINT IS THE INDUSTRY DOES. PAY FORD THE REMEDIATION AS WELL AS- ARE CURRENTLY OFFERING. WE DO THROUGH AYE WELL FEES- INTO THE HEAD WHILE FUND- ARE ARE ONE MILLION THREE MILLION AND A FIVE MILLION DOLLAR APPROPRIATION DOES COME FROM INDUSTRY FUNDED. OF APPROPRIATIONS OKAY THANK YOU THAT- BUT THAT IS WOEFULLY INADEQUATE IN THAT IT'S ONLY BEEN ABLE TO FUND ELEVEN WELLS A YEAR- OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS- ELEVEN WELLS A YEAR WOULD MEAN IT'LL BE TWO HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE WE- GET CLOSE TO HAVE. TO GETTING THERE OR MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YEARS SO- THAT THERE IS AN INDUSTRY FUND OUT THERE BUT IT IS SIMPLY BOTH ITS CAPTAIN TERMS OF HOW MUCH WE CAN SPEND EACH YEAR AND IT'S GOT TO TURN TO HOW MUCH REVENUE. IS COMING IN AND- I WOULD SUGGEST THAT IT IS CERTAINLY NEEDS TO BE INCREASED BUT THE FINAL POINT THAT I WANTED TO MAKE IT JUST IT'S A VERY QUICK QUESTION BUT- WHEN WE PASSED AB EIGHT NINETY SIX LAST YEAR- THAT WE AUTHORED- THE- THE DEPARTMENT TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO MORE APPROPRIATELY. PUT LIENS ON THE PROPERTY TO TRY TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T HAVE- ABANDONED WELLS SAID TO HAVE WALKED AWAY FROM THE SYSTEM- OWNERS SHOULD HAVE WALKED AWAY AND LEFT US WITH THE ABANDONED WELLS- WE SAID THAT WE WANTED TO HAVE TO TRY TO HAVE THE DEPARTMENT- HANDLE IT ADMINISTRATIVELY- WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT- IF THEY COULD AND AS IF THEY NEEDED TO DO AN ANALYSIS BEFORE THEY WENT OUTSIDE A NOTE IN HERE HAT THERE IS ONE POSITION- THAT YOU'RE REQUESTING TO DO THE ADMINISTRATION OF THAT PROGRAM. AND I JUST WOULD LIKE TO- ASK WAS THERE ANALYSIS DONE OF TRYING TO DO IT IN. HOUSE BEFORE THIS REQUEST CAME FORWARD THIS IS A NON PROTECT PRESENTATION OUT OF A SUMMIT CHEN. BUT I BELIEVE WE GOT A WAY TO DO AT A SIMILAR- COST RECOVERY THAT'S BEEN DONE EVENTUALLY AGENCIES- AND FOUND THAT THAT WAS THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO GO ABOUT. COLLECTIONS AND IT WAS COST NEUTRAL WE NEED ONE. POSITION TO OVERSEE THIS BUT- THERE'S A COLLECTION AGENCY THAT. THEY WOULDN'T GET PAID UNLESS THEY COLLECTED ON THESE LIENS AND WEEK WE DO HAVE- LEXIS NEXIS AND WOULD NEED TO GO THROUGH SOFTWARE EVALUATION SAY. WHICH SPECIFIC PROPERTIES WOULD LEAVES BE APPLIED TO- BUT THEN THE UP THE CONTRACTING IT OUT- IS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY THAT THEY GO OUT AND BASICALLY. ACTION AGENCY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IT DOES SEEM- WITH- THE FUNDING THAT'S PROPOSED HERE IN THE POTENTIAL FEDERAL FUNDING- AND PERHAPS AN ADDITIONAL- INDUSTRY FUNDING OF THAT- WERE TO BE. POSSIBLE WE'RE ON THE PRECIPICE OF- SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES THAT WILL BE. UP A SPENT TO CLEAN UP THE AND THE- CAP THESE- OF OVER FIVE THOUSAND ABANDONED TO AND POTENTIALLY ABANDONED WELLS- IT STRIKES ME THAT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY. TO DO SOME OF THE- EQUITABLE TRANSITION WORK THAT WE SO OFTEN TALK ABOUT IN TERMS OF- PROVIDING EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES. FOR INDIVIDUALS IN THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY- GIVEN A- SHIPS TO OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND SO FORTH- DOES THE DEPARTMENT HAVE A PLAN FOR. A CREATING A EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES SPECIFICALLY- FOR THAT COHORT OF WORKERS. YES IT'S DO WE KNOW THE INCREASED SPENDING SO FAR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S ONLY- ALEX- ANNOUNCES ONE POINT ONE BILLION OF FOUR POINT SEVEN BILLION. STILL YOU KNOW 75% MORE THAN THREE A HALF BILLION DOLLARS OF THE WILL BE AVAILABLE NATIONALLY- THROUGH THE FEDERAL PROGRAM PART OF THAT HAS THE DAVIS BACON REQUIREMENTS A PREVAILING WAGE. WE PLAN TO WORK FOR IN OUR CONTRACTS INCLUDE THEM AS PUBLIC WORKS- WHICH WOULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR GOOD PAYING CAREERS THAT ALLOW FOR FOLKS WHO ARE ENGAGED IN THIS. SECTOR I MEAN THE PAY SCALE- WITH OPERATING ENGINEERS ANYWHERE TO FORTY TO SEVENTY DOLLARS AN HOUR- WHICH PROVIDE A LIVING WAGE ANYWHERE CALIFORNIA AT THAT RATE- AND WE'VE ENGAGE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS TO BEGIN THE PROCESS. I'M I'M- WELL I WANNA MAKE. I AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THESE ARE PREVAILING WAGE JOBS THAT THE- THAT THEY ARE- WELL PAYING JOBS- WILL THOSE WHO ARE EMPLOYED IN THE OIL AND GAS OUR RECENTLY UNEMPLOYED- THE WHO WERE IN THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY- BE PRIORITIZED- FOR THOSE POSITIONS. WE CAN ADD LANGUAGE IN A CONTRACT PRIORITIZE THE FORMALLY- UNEMPLOYED OR LOCAL HIRES- BY THE DIFFERENT REGIONS THAT WE CAN INCLUDE THAT LANGUAGE- THE GOAL OF THE FEDERAL FUNDING IS A JOBS PROGRAM- WORK OF RECENTLY LAID OFF WORKERS THIS TYPE OF WORK- OF. RING HANDS AND VACUUM TRUCK DRIVERS AND- DEMOLITION OF- THANKS IN AND SEPARATE EQUIPMENT IS SIMILAR WORK THAT HAPPENS- IN OTHER PARTS OF THE OIL INDUSTRY SO THAT NOTHING REALLY CAN DO WORK OVER- ACTIVITIES FOR CURRENT OPERATORS pAS WELL AS ANY PLUGIN ABANDONMENT WORK SO IT'S- THE FOLKS ARE LAID OFF IT'S VERY SIMILAR. TO WORK TO THAT THAT TYPE OF- A- DIRECT REAL. WORLD MEDIATION WORK. GREAT WELL I'VE LOOK FORWARD TO- IN FACT ALL AT YOU TO- SHARE- THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE FOR THOSE CONTRACTS- OR FOR THAT FOR THE FOR THE PROPOSAL THAT'S RELEVANT TO THAT ISSUE- IN DETAIL SO THAT- THEY CAN LOOK IT OVER WITH MORE SPECIFICITY.

THE DEPARTMENT IS LAW OF WORK TO DO WITH YOU I SEE YOUR- AND I AM ITS CONSIST WITH AND- REVIEWS AND I. THE CONSERVE IS DONE FOR THIS PROGRAM. SO ON A MISTER HALL- FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE THE L. A. O. RAISES A NUMBER OF ISSUES BUT- THERE THERE ARE THERE ARE EXISTING VACANCIES THAT- THAT NEED TO BE HIRED AND TRAINED UNDER SUPERVISION THAT NEEDS TO BE PROVIDED- ARE YOU SATISFIED THE- OF THOSE THINGS ARE ALL. IN PLACE AND TO- WHAT IT IN A IN A POSITION TO- TO ACCOMPLISH THE GOALS THAT THE FUNDING INTENDS. YEAH THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN AGGRESSIVELY HIRING THIS YEAR AND THERE IS STILL SOME WORK TO DO. WE FELT THAT YOU KNOW THE POSITION REQUEST ITSELF WAS NECESSARY AND THEY'LL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO- YOU KNOW BRING DOWN THE BACON C. RATE WE JUST BEARD THE ACTUAL POSITION NEED AND THE TIMING IS A LITTLE BIT. I AM. SEPARATE THAT WE DO THINK THAT THE PHASED IN APPROACH OF SEVENTEEN POSITIONS A YEAR IS ACHIEVABLE FOR THEM- SO YES THEY THINK THEY CAN MAKE THEIR- IS THERE DATA AVAILABLE ON- HOW THE- THE RECENT POSITIONS HAVE IMPROVED WITNESSING RIGHTS AND- LEASE INSPECTIONS. HOWEVER THREE ARE ARE WE SEEING IMPROVEMENT THERE ARE REALIZE IT'S STILL PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT EARLY AND- IT'S NOT THAT MANY PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN HIGHER BUT- ARE ARE WE SEEING. DATA THAT SHOWS IMPROVEMENT. YES I BELIEVE THERE IS ALL ALL DEFERRED TO THE DEPARTMENT I AM BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE DATA IN FRONT OF ME BUT- I WOULD BE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP UNLESS THEY HAVE THAT. RIGHT NOW. OUR PRELIMINARY REVIEW OF WITNESSING RATES FOR THIS PAST YEAR IS. PROBABLY EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT- THERE IS A SIX EIGHT WEEK LAG IN DATA BECOMING AVAILABLE IN OUR- IN THE WELLSTAR SYSTEM SO. IF THEY'RE NOT IT'S NOT FINAL YET BUT THAT'S OUR PRELIMINARY- BINDING- WE HAVE GONE THROUGH AND- COMPLETED. FIFTY HIRINGS THIS YEAR- ALREADY- HOWEVER ABOUT 70% OF THOSE ENDED UP BEING PROMOTIONS WHICH CREATED. A NEW VACANCIES AND NETWORK TEAM TO WORK THROUGH. AND ARE NOT REVIEW RIGHT NOW WE'RE CURRENTLY ABOUT ELEVEN PERCENT- BASICALLY SEE RATE- WITH- WITH NEW FOLKS COMING ON BOARD- AND HERE IN THE- LAST MONTH THIS MONTH- AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE WORK. TO GET THAT NUMBER DOWN LOWER. THANK YOU YOU MENTIONED- 85% I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE- WHAT THAT'S OVER. WAS IN REFERENCE TO. YEAH MICHAEL OF GOAL OF REACHING HER PERCENT OF THE WITH BUT WE GOT 285% AS OUR PRIMARY- PERCENT OF THE SHELL WITNESSING THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS MISTER BENNETT. THANK YOU- WITH NOT HAVING THIS INFORMATION VERY FAR IN ADVANCE I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TECHNICAL QUESTION ABOUT HOW TO READ YOUR CHART ON PAGE THIRTY EIGHT OF YOUR REPORT- DOWN THE BOTTOM E. IT SAYS OUTCOMES AND ACCOUNTABILITY AT SAYS FIELD PRESENCE AND TALKS ABOUT PROJECTED OUTCOMES THAT AT IT INTO THE CHARGES WORKLOAD MAJOR FIELD PRESENCE THAT HAS C. Y. B. Y. B. Y. PLUS ONE DO I PLEDGE TO BE Y. PLUS THREE AND BEYOND PLUS. CAN YOU JUST TELL ME WHAT THOSE WHAT TO SEE WHY MAIN B. Y. MAIN B. Y. PLUS ONE B. Y. PLUS TO SERVE SOMEBODY WHO COULD ANSWER THAT QUESTION FOR ME PLEASE. SURE THIS IS ANDREW HOLTZ DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I AM. ON THAT CHART- THE C. WHY WOULD REPRESENTS CURRENT YEAR- ACTIVITY IN CURRENT YEAR RESOURCES- BEGINNING AND BEGINNING IN BUDGET HERE AN ONGOING THAT WOULD BE REFLECTING THE OUTCOMES THAT WOULD BE ACHIEVED WITH THE ADDITIONAL POSITIONS EACH YEAR. THE THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE PROJECTING- ONE YEAR OUT TWO YEARS OUT THREE YEARS OUT IS THAT WHAT YOU SUGGEST. CORRECT SO YOU'RE PROJECTING THAT AND THEN YOU BUT WE DON'T HAVE ACTUAL. MEASURABLE DATA FROM THE NEW HIGHER SHARE. IN TERMS OF THAT THE CORRECT. YEAH I WOULD SAY IT THAT IS CORRECT IN A SENSE ALTHOUGH IT THE BEGINNING OF THE DOCUMENT WE ALSO HAVE CHARTS THAT SHOW- EXISTING WORKLOAD METRICS THAT WOULD ALSO. THEY WOULD BE HERE YOUR PAST YOUR INFORMATION. FLOWING UP THROUGH CURRENT YEAR SO IF YOU TAKE THE TWO CHARTS TOGETHER- YOU GET ALL OF THAT ACTIVITY AND THEN IF THE DEPARTMENT WERE TO COME BACK FOR A SUBSEQUENT REQUEST ALL OF THAT INFORMATION WOULD BE IN THAT. BACKGROUND HISTORY SECTION FOR WORKLOAD GREAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH JUST JUST THIS KIND OF DATA BE REALLY IMPORTANT I THINK GOING FORWARD FOR US TO CONTINUE JUST FIVE POSITIONS THANK. TANK YOU. MR VICE CHAIR. OF I THINK YOU JERRY BLUM- MAYBE THIS IS FOR THE BOMBING OF FINANCE OR- THE DIRECTOR OF CAL JIM WHAT IS THE CURRENT- FUNDING LEVEL. OF THE OIL GAS AND GEOTHERMAL MEASURE FUND- I MAYBE THIS WAS A QUESTION THAT COULD HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP AND THE PREVIOUS TOPIC BUT HAS THAT CAMPING GROWING- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS ACCOUNT IS FUNDED BY FEES. COLLECTED FROM FROM OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCERS. HI ALL DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SURE I CAN ASSIST I AM RIGHT NOW THE- THE FUND ITSELF IS BRINGING. PROJECTED TO BRING IN A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AND BUDGET YEAR- WITH EXPENDITURES ABOUT IN LINE WITH THAT. FOR DEPARTMENT CONSERVATION ITSELF IT'S ABOUT NINETY EIGHT MILLION AND EXPENDITURES. BUT THERE ARE A FEW OTHER DEPARTMENTS THAT SPEND OUT OF THE FUND AS WELL. AND SO IT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR MILLION IN REVENUE AND A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION AND EXPENDITURES. BUT THE DEPARTMENT HAS THE AUTHORITY TO SET FEEL LEVELS SUFFICIENT TO COVER EXPENDITURES EACH YEAR OKAY AND HAS THAT THE TREND BEEN AS A GROWN OVER THE- THAT'S A PAST FIVE YEARS- I DON'T HAVE THE FIVE YEAR IN FRONT OF ME I CAN SAY FOR THE THREE YEARS THREE YEARS TO GET HARMON HAS BEEN HAS BEEN SPENDING DOWN THEIR FUND BALANCE A LITTLE BIT- YOU KNOW TRYING TO MAINTAIN A PRUDENT RESERVE. BY THAT TIME. BUT YES IT IT LOOKS LIKE WITH ALL OF THESE PROPOSALS IF APPROVED. IT WOULD BE ABOUT A SEVEN AND A HALF CENT INCREASE PER BARREL ON THREE PAIRS. TO MAINTAIN THE FUND BALANCE SAID. SO MY YEAH AN INCREDIBLE I'M WRONG BUT- TEN MILLION DOLLARS WAS BORROWED- IN IN TWENTY TWENTY AND TRANSFERRED TO THE GENERAL FUND- AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC BECAUSE OF. THE CERTAINLY THE ANTICIPATED BUDGET IMPACT- IS THERE AN EFFORT TO REPAY OR PUT THAT TEN MILLION BACK INTO THE FUND. SEEING THAT IT'S NOT YOU THINK THAT THE FUND IS USED TO DEAL WITH- I TO WELLS AND WELL ABATEMENT. ABSOLUTELY I'M THAT THAT TEN MILLION DOLLAR LOAN WAS ACTUALLY FOR A DIFFERENT FUND THAT'S THE HAZARDOUS AND IDLE WELL ABATEMENT FUND OKAY. THAT'S RIGHT I AM. YEAH AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS. IT WAS BORROWED- IT IS SCHEDULED TO BE PAID BACK IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. BUT WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE FUND BALANCE THERE AND IF IT'S NEEDED EARLIER WE CAN TRIGGER THAT LOAN REPAYMENT OKAY BUT AND I DO THINK RIGHT IT IS A HAD IT HAS JUST IDLE AND DESERVE DESERTED WELL PAYMENT BUT WHY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR- IF I IF I CAN ASK. SINCE IF THIS DOES IT THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT SURPLUS THIS YEAR. I'M YOU KNOW IT WHEN ALL OF THESE LOANS WERE TRIGGERED- WE VIEWED ALL OF THESE AS A YOU KNOW HOW SOON DID WE THINK THAT THE FUNDS WERE ACTUALLY GOING TO NEED THE REPAYMENT- I'M- SO FOR THIS PARTICULAR FUND IT HAD A SUFFICIENT. FUND BALANCE THAT IT COULD COVER ITS EXPENDITURES THREE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR- WE ARE LOOKING AT THIS SINCE THERE ARE SO MANY FUNDS THAT HAD LOANED OUT TO THE GENERAL FUND. THAT WE YOU KNOW WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT REPAYMENTS I AM. EACH YEAR AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THIS YEAR. OKAY DO THE DIRECTOR- THE DIRECTOR CAL JAM. I GUESS. IF I COULD TAKE A STEP BACK- CERTAINLY IT'S BEEN ESTABLISHED- THAT- THE FEES COLLECTED FROM FROM OIL AND GAS PRODUCER'S IS IT IS. THE PREDOMINANT- SOURCE. OF THE OIL GAS AND GEOTHERMAL MR FUND. I GUESS FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE DO YOU WANT THERE TO BE AN OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA. THE NUTCRACKER WITH THE- WELL AS IT MIGHT APPEAR IS THAT YOU WANT THE FEES AND TAXES FROM THE ENERGY INDUSTRY BUT YOU DON'T WANT THE PRODUCT. SO HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU FIND IN YOUR DEPARTMENT. IF YOU DON'T WANT THE INDUSTRY HERE. YEP PERSONALLY- THAT'S NOT MY- PERSPECTIVE OPINION- YEAH THAT'S BEEN CLEAR THAT THERE IS AN ANNUAL ASSESSMENT ON PRODUCTION AND IN THOSE FUNDS GO TOWARDS OPERATIONS OF THE AGENCY. SO IF SOMETHING ASSIGNMENT IS THIS THERE WAS A FURTHER IF WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S GOAL IS TO. ELIMINATE THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY THERE IS NO CULTURE. I CAN'T SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THIS REGIONAL. WHICH BUT YOU ARE LIMITED I MEAN YOU ARE THE REGISTRATION. A POINT OF ORDER AND CHAIRMAN BLUE ACTIVE I WOULD JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THE LEGISLATURE RECENTLY CHANGE THE MISSION OF CAL JIM AND LIKE WE WERE THE ORIGINAL MISSION OF CAL JIM USED TO BE TO ENCOURAGE THE- DEVELOPMENT OF- OF. OIL INDUSTRY TO GAS AND OIL INDUSTRY AND DOES SO AYE AYES I THINK IT'S A AND B. DOES THAT LEGISLATION WENT THROUGH AND WAS PASSED AND SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY. SPEAKS TO WHAT IS THE INTENTION OF EVERYBODY FROM THE GOVERNOR ON DOWN TO THE SURFACE- AND I WANT TO AGAIN I WANT TO STIPULATE THAT I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AND AYE I I'LL I'LL- I WANT TO GET TO THE- TO THE CRUX OF MY QUESTION OVER THE POINT IS. THE BCPS THAT SAID TO THE CASTING DIRECTOR THE YOUR BCPS ARE FUNDED. THROUGH THE FEES. AND TAXES- AND- ON THE INDUSTRY AND IT WAS STATED BY THE PART OF FINANCE. THAT THERE ALSO DOING WHERE WE'RE WE'RE CHARGING FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS CHARGING FEES ON EVERY BARREL OF OIL. THAT GOES INTO THE OIL GAS AND GEOTHERMAL MEASURE TO FUND. AND INTO THE HOUSES IDLE AND DOES VERY WELL ABATEMENT FUND. THE INDUSTRY IS PAYING INTO THOSE- INTO THOSE FUNDS THAT WE ARE ALLOCATING AS THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. SO MY POINT I GUESS TO THE TO THE TO THE TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA BARBARA INTO THIS COMMITTEE IS THAT THE WHOLE OUR WHOLE EXERCISE OF ALLOCATING THESE RESOURCES. TO TO A PLUG I TO WELLS TO FIND THESE PERMANENT POSITIONS. COME FROM SOMEWHERE. IT COMES FROM FEES AND TAXES PAID FOR BY THE INDUSTRY SO IT'S A SIMILAR DYNAMIC I'M TRYING TO EMPHASIZE WHEN IT COMES TO THE CIGARETTE TAX WHEN IT COMES TO OTHER THINGS IS THAT IF THE INDUSTRY GOES AWAY THERE IS NO REVENUE INTO THESE FUNDS. AND SO THAT'S MY POINT AND I'LL JUST AT MY LAST QUESTION AND I APPRECIATE THE CHAIRS PATIENTS IS THAT- TO THE CALCIUM DIRECTOR IS THAT THE TWENTY POSITIONS THAT WERE PRESENTED LAST APPROVED LAST YEAR. I THERE'S A UNDERSTANDING IS THAT YOU YOUR DIVISION WAS KIND ENOUGH TO LOAN SOME STAFF OUT FOR A COVERT CONTACT TRACING SO- WITH ALL THESE STAFFING NEEDS GOING AROUND THE TO OTHER ACTIVITIES. IS THERE A NEED. LOOKING AT THE L. A. ANALYSIS. FOR THESE NEW PERMANENT POSITIONS. YES THERE IS A NEED- ART OUR CURRENT VACANCY RATE IS- JUST BELOW ELEVEN PERCENT- WE HAVE FILLED- WE HAVE NINE POSITIONS. THE LETTER FROM LASHING BCP THAT HAVE BEEN FILLED WITH TO DO THAT ARE ARE MAKING EARNS FIVE HIRING STAGES. BUT WE DID A SUBSTANTIAL WORKLOAD ANALYSIS TWO YEARS AGO THE DALLAS FIVE- WITH THE CURRENT REQUIREMENTS THE- WE ACTUALLY HAVE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT POSITIONS TO BE ABLE TO FILL WHAT'S BEEN ASKED OF THE AGENCY. A REQUEST IS NEXT OKAY- WE DON'T RUBIO WE THERE WAS 2% LAST YEAR AND THIS IS NEXT STEP THAT- IDENTIFIED IN RESOURCE NEED THAT WE HAVE. OKAY I CERTAINLY- WOULD SAY THAT THE L. A. ON THE TO BE LOOKED AT LITTLE FURTHER BUT HI PUSH THE CHAIRS HANDLED THANK. SO ALL- EXERC THE PRO. OF CHAIR- WE THE WRIST TO THE PENALTY TO QUESTION- OF THE VICE CHAIR- WAS WAS POSING WHICH IS IN FACT- YOU KNOW IN A IN A COURT OF LAW WE WOULD SAY THAT CALLS FOR SPECULATION. RIGHT NOW THE INDUSTRY DOES EXIST- ADDED SPECULATIVE AS TO WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IF THE INDUSTRY WERE- TO VANISH BUT I THINK WHAT DOESN'T CHANGE IS THE NEED TO- ADDRESS THESE VERY IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES SO IF THE INDUSTRY NO LONGER EXISTED FOR SOME REASON THEN WE CERTAINLY WOULD WANT TO LOOK ELSEWHERE TO FUND THOSE VERY. IMPORTANT PRIORITIES- AND WITH THAT- LET ME ASK IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM OUR MEMBERS ON THE THIRTY FIVE NON DISCUSSION ISSUES THAT WE HAVE ON THE AGENDA TODAY. MR FONG. I JUST HAVE- ONE QUICK QUESTION IF THE IF THE DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES IS- IS STILL ON THE LINE- IT IS ONE WEEK SINCE- THE YOU SAID THAT THE REPORTS ARE COMING FOR THE LAW FIRE- GROUP OF. REPORTS WERE FORTUNATE TO I WAS WONDERING IF THERE WAS AN UPDATE ON THAT I JUST WANNA TAKE THE MOMENT TO ASK IF. THEY'RE READY. THIS IS LIKE ASKING AFTER RESOURCES AGENCY I'LL CIRCLE BACK WITH OUR- FOR ST LUKE'S AND FIND OUT OUT FOR YOU. YOU ARE WELCOME SO WE WILL NOW BEGIN WITH PUBLIC COMMENTS- WE'RE ALLOCATING ONE MINUTE FOR- A MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK. FOR EACH MEMBER TO SPEAK ABOUT A TOTAL OF ONE. AT HOME WE WILL START WITH THOSE WHO ARE HERE IN THE ROOM AND THEN THAT WILL OPEN THE PHONE LINES AND REMINDING YOU THAT THE PHONE NUMBER IS. NINE TWO. EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN AND THEN- YOU'LL NEED THE ACCESS CODE. ONE THREE ONE FIVE ONE TWO SEVEN ONE THREE ONE. FIVE ONE TWO SEVEN WILL BEGIN WITH PUBLIC COMMENT HERE IN THE ROOM. SALIM GO AHEAD SIR. YES SIR DISTINGUISH MISTER CHAIR DILUTION HERE ON BEHALF OF- WHEN MY CLIENTS THE FORTY ACRE CONSERVATION LEAGUE. NONPROFIT AFRICAN AMERICAN LAND TRUST THAT REALLY LAW TO THE INTENT OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S. MULTI BENEFIT NATURE BASED PROPOSALS THOUGH WE BELIEVE THE PROGRAM THE PROPOSAL IS LACKING IN QUITE A BIT OF DETAIL- AND IT'S NOT A ATTENTIVE ENOUGH TO I THINK THREE PILLARS THAT WE THINK OR BELIEVE OVER LINE WITH THE NATURE BASED- PROPOSALS. WE BELIEVE THE ADMINISTRATION SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AS IT DOES BUT SHOULD ALSO BE REALLY MOVING IN TO TACKLE THIS CONCEPT OF RECREATIONAL JUSTICE. IS WELL AS ECONOMIC JUSTICE WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE BROADER SPECTRUM OF ACTIVITIES THAT THEY'RE GETTING READY TO UNDERTAKE. UNDER THE THIRTY BY THIRTY WE'VE WE HAVE RESPONDED- THROUGH A NUMBER OF REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS. WHEN V. IT MINISTRATION TALKS ABOUT AN OUTDOORS FOR ALL OUR ACCESS FOR ALL. WE'VE BEEN A BIT CRITICAL- BUT IT'S WE'VE HAD SOME GOOD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE FACT THAT ACCESS AND PROXIMITY. SHOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE THE SAME THING- TO GIVE A VERY BRIEF EXAMPLE THERE ARE NUMEROUS CALIFORNIANS I WANT TO FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON PEOPLE OF COLOR. THAT ARM WOULD. SOONER GO THROUGH TSA. ARM BE SUBJECTED TO A PAT DOWN SEARCH AND FLY OFF SOMEWHERE ON AN AIRPLANE FOR FIVE HOURS. TO HAVE A CURATED SORT OF NATURE BASED. EXPERIENCE BEFORE THEY WOULD GO OUT TO A FREE. OUR STATE OR FEDERAL FORSTER OR OR PARK AND- AND I THINK THAT GOES ON A LONG ENOUGH TO SAY THAT. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE GOALS OF THIRTY BY THIRTY IN SOME OF THESE OTHER THINGS. THERE'S ONE THING THAT WE DEFINITELY ALL AGREE ON. IT'S THAT FOSTERING CONNECTIONS TO NATURE. ARM WILL IMPROVE THE LOT OR THE BREADTH OF STAKEHOLDERS IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS THAT YOU ALL ARE DEBATING NOW. ASK YOU TO WRAP UP THE ADMINISTRATION ACKNOWLEDGES IT WE ACKNOWLEDGE IT WOULD BUT WE BELIEVE THIS PROPOSAL. FALLS SHORT IN A FEW WAYS IN AND WE HAVE SOME IDEAS WILL WILL DISTRIBUTE SOME LITERATURE TO THE COMMITTEE. ON HOW TO FIX THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. GOOD MORNING KEVIN BLUHM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE PAUL MASON WITH PACIFIC FOREST TRUST THANK YOU FOR THE HEARING AND FOR. DOING WELL THE CHALLENGES OF THE REMOTENESS AND ACCELERATED TIMELINE THIS MORNING OR THIS YEAR- I WANT YOU TO THE CLIMATE RESILIENCE PACKAGE AS WELL AND IN PARTICULAR. HIGHLIGHT THAT THE SCALE OF THE CHALLENGE AND FEEL THE NEED JUST VASTLY. EXCEEDS WHAT WAS COMMITTED LAST SEPTEMBER- FOR VERTICALLY THE NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS HAVE A SIDE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MILLIONS OF ACRES OF CONSERVATION THAT'S CALLED FOR IN THE PATHWAYS TO THIRTY BY THIRTY. CLEARLY THAT'S GOING TO BE A HUGE- TALENT ON A RELATIVELY QUICK TIGHT TIME LINE. AND ALSO HIGHLIGHT THE SCOPING PLAN UPDATE THAT IS BEING- DEVELOPED OVER THEIR RESOURCES BOARD RIGHT NOW. IT'S GONNA HAVE A MUCH MORE ROBUST DISCUSSION OF THE ROLE OF NATURAL WORKING LANDS IN THE HAS IN THE PAST AND THAT'S ALSO GOING TO CALL FOR. STATE RESOURCES IF WE REALLY WANT ME ARE TWENTY THIRTY AND TWENTY FORTY FIVE GOALS. SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO LOOK AT THE SCALE OF THE CHALLENGE AND WORK BACKWARDS FROM WHAT WE. HAVE COMMITTED TO DOING BY TWENTY THIRTY. DID I DON'T WHAT READ. WILL TO BE AVAILABLE BECAUSE I SUSPECT IN FACT I AM CERTAIN THAT VASTLY EXCEED WHAT WE HAVE ALREADY COMMITTED. AND I WILL CLOSE BY NOTING. THAT CONSERVATION IS A CAPITAL OUTLAY. THEY PUT US IN THAT CATEGORY OF EXPENDITURES THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS MOMENT. AND I THINK THAT MAY BE AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION AS THE BUDGET IS COMING TO FRUITION. AND IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY FOR US THIS YEAR THANK YOU THANK YOU.
