00:33:40.518 --> 00:33:41.886
CULTURE.

00:33:41.953 --> 00:33:43.521
EARLIER THIS YEAR I WAS

00:33:43.588 --> 00:33:45.823
ABSOLUTELY SHOCKED TO FIND OUT

00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:47.358
THE DURING A PERIOD OF ALMOST

00:33:47.425 --> 00:33:49.193
THREE DECADES.

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:50.762
MORE THAN FOURTEEN THOUSAND

00:33:50.828 --> 00:33:52.230
YOUNG WOMEN.

00:33:52.296 --> 00:33:55.133
HAD BEEN SEXUALLY EXPLOITED --

00:33:55.199 --> 00:33:57.769
SEXUALLY.

00:33:57.835 --> 00:33:59.270
EXPLOITED I'M GOING TO USE THAT

00:33:59.337 --> 00:34:00.238
WORD.

00:34:00.304 --> 00:34:02.039
BY DOCTOR TENDO A LONG TIME

00:34:02.106 --> 00:34:05.643
GYNECOLOGIST AT U. S. C. WHO IS

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:07.578
THERE FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS.

00:34:07.645 --> 00:34:09.213
HE HARASSED ALL THESE WOMEN BUT

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.882
HE SPECIFICALLY TARGETED WOMEN

00:34:10.948 --> 00:34:12.984
OF COLOR.

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:15.319
AND IMMIGRANT WOMEN.

00:34:15.386 --> 00:34:16.954
THE INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS.

00:34:17.021 --> 00:34:18.790
THEY WERE IN FACT THE MOST

00:34:18.856 --> 00:34:21.259
VULNERABLE POPULATION.

00:34:21.325 --> 00:34:23.828
I'VE INTRODUCED AB FIFTEEN TAN

00:34:23.895 --> 00:34:25.596
IN RESPONSE TO THIS MY HOPE TO

00:34:25.663 --> 00:34:26.731
REOPEN THE STATUTE OF

00:34:26.798 --> 00:34:28.633
LIMITATIONS.

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:30.501
THAT IS ALREADY EXPIRED AND THEN

00:34:30.568 --> 00:34:32.103
TO ALLOW THE SURVIVORS TO SUBMIT

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:34.005
THEIR CLAIM TO COURT IF THEY SO

00:34:34.071 --> 00:34:35.573
CHOOSE.

00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:37.575
IT'S THE UNFORTUNATE REALITY

00:34:37.642 --> 00:34:39.310
REALITY THAT I HAVE TO AUTHORS

00:34:39.377 --> 00:34:41.078
SUCH A BILL A WE SHOULD BE

00:34:41.145 --> 00:34:44.415
BEYOND ALL OF THIS -- BUT IT WAS

00:34:44.482 --> 00:34:46.717
NECESSARY LEGISLATION IN MY

00:34:46.784 --> 00:34:48.786
OPINION BECAUSE THE ACTS THAT

00:34:48.853 --> 00:34:50.922
OCCURRED OCCURRED OVER SUCH A

00:34:50.988 --> 00:34:52.290
LONG PERIOD OF TIME.

00:34:52.356 --> 00:34:53.524
WE KNOW THE PREVENTION IS

00:34:53.591 --> 00:34:55.760
CRITICAL. TO STOPPING THESE

00:34:55.827 --> 00:34:57.995
EGREGIOUS ACTS AND I APPLAUD YOU

00:34:58.062 --> 00:34:59.397
FOR ALL THE WORK THAT YOU DO AND

DID WANT -- TO TALK ABOUT

00:38:24.935 --> 00:38:26.704
SENATOR SUSAN RUBIO WHO'S BEST

00:38:26.771 --> 00:38:28.072
SAID IN THE LEGISLATURE NOW --

00:38:28.139 --> 00:38:30.474
AND AS A SURVIVOR OF DOMESTIC

00:38:30.541 --> 00:38:37.415
VIOLENCE SHE'S DOING SOME WORK

00:38:37.481 --> 00:38:38.949
ON THE OTHER SIDE AND I DON'T

00:38:39.016 --> 00:38:39.917
WANT TO FEEL -- HEARD THUNDER --

00:38:39.984 --> 00:38:40.818
BECAUSE SHE IS VERY OBVIOUSLY

00:38:40.885 --> 00:38:41.686
MORE VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT THE

00:38:41.752 --> 00:38:42.353
ISSUE AND SHE'S GOT A PIECE OF A

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:43.320
COUPLE PIECES OF LEGISLATION.

00:38:43.387 --> 00:38:44.488
ON THE OTHER SIDE AND I AND THE

00:38:44.555 --> 00:38:45.356
NEXT -- HOPEFULLY THE NEXT

00:38:45.423 --> 00:38:46.991
HEARING WE WE CAN HEAR FROM HER

00:38:47.058 --> 00:38:50.027
AND HOW THE LEGISLATION IS GOING --

00:38:50.094 --> 00:38:51.629
BUT I'VE ALSO PARTNERED WITH

00:38:51.696 --> 00:38:53.597
SENATOR BAIL -- DO AS WE DID

00:38:53.664 --> 00:38:56.200
LAST YEAR TO TO REQUEST A FIFTY

00:38:56.267 --> 00:38:57.635
MILLION DOLLARS -- FOR SIX

00:38:57.702 --> 00:38:58.235
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL

00:38:58.302 --> 00:38:59.970
ASSAULT PART OF THE CONVERSATION

00:39:00.037 --> 00:39:01.338
THAT THE SENATORS HASN'T SENATOR

00:39:01.405 --> 00:39:03.974
SUSAN RUBIO HAS HAD -- IS ABOUT

00:39:04.041 --> 00:39:06.444
THE PREVENTION AND ABOUT HEALTHY

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:09.113
RELATIONSHIPS -- SHE AND I HAD --

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:11.449
ANY DENT IN OUR DISTRICT -- FOR

00:39:11.515 --> 00:39:14.385
YOUNG WOMEN AND WHEN WE TALKED

00:39:14.452 --> 00:39:16.287
ABOUT -- HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS

00:39:16.353 --> 00:39:17.588
ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT CAME UP

00:39:17.655 --> 00:39:19.356
WITH THE YOUNG FOLKS WAS THAT

00:39:19.423 --> 00:39:20.991
THEY DIDN'T REALIZE THAT HEALTHY

00:39:21.058 --> 00:39:22.226
RELATIONSHIPS THEY NECESSARILY

00:39:22.293 --> 00:39:23.327
MEAN TO ME TO BE ROMANTIC

00:39:23.394 --> 00:39:24.762
RELATIONSHIPS.

00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:25.596
BECAUSE WE TALK ABOUT THEM AS

00:39:25.663 --> 00:39:27.665
THE VIOLENCE IN TERMS OF OF A

00:39:27.732 --> 00:39:31.102
ROMANTIC PARTNERS -- THE SPOUSES

00:39:31.168 --> 00:39:33.070
AND GIRLFRIENDS AND BOYFRIENDS

00:39:33.137 --> 00:39:35.306
BUT THE REALITY IS AND THE THE

00:39:35.372 --> 00:39:37.041
YOUNG WOMEN POINTED THAT OUT IS

00:39:37.108 --> 00:39:38.309
THAT THEY THOUGHT.

00:39:38.375 --> 00:39:40.311
THE SAME THING BUT WHEN WE HAD A

00:39:40.377 --> 00:39:42.012
CONVERSATION WITH THEM WE ALSO

00:39:42.079 --> 00:39:43.614
FOUND OUT THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE

00:39:43.681 --> 00:39:44.081
TO BE.

00:39:44.148 --> 00:39:47.284
A ROMANTIC PARTNER YOU CAN BE --

00:39:47.351 --> 00:39:49.587
VIOLATED OUR BULLIED BY BY

00:39:49.653 --> 00:39:52.289

EVEN IF IT'S NOT ROMANTICALLY

00:40:01.232 --> 00:40:02.633
THEN WHEN YOU GET INTO A

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:03.934
RELATIONSHIP A ROMANTIC

00:40:04.001 --> 00:40:04.802
RELATIONSHIP YOU DON'T KNOW THE

00:40:04.869 --> 00:40:06.737
DIFFERENCE AND YOU ASSUME THAT

00:40:06.804 --> 00:40:08.072

OKAY EVEN IF YOUR GUT TELLS YOU

00:40:09.907 --> 00:40:11.342
THAT IT'S NOT OKAY AND SO IS

00:40:11.408 --> 00:40:13.077

BEHAVIOR.

00:52:40.257 --> 00:52:41.291
I AM PROUD TO SAY THAT DURING

00:52:54.304 --> 00:52:55.572
WE KNOW THAT WITH MORE FINANCIAL

00:52:55.639 --> 00:52:57.240
SUPPORT OUR EFFORTS WOULD REACH

00:52:57.307 --> 00:52:59.643
EVEN MORE PEOPLE.

00:52:59.709 --> 00:53:00.844
SOMETIMES DIRECT SERVICE WORK

00:53:00.911 --> 00:53:02.846
CAN FEEL OVERWHELMING AND MAYBE

00:53:02.913 --> 00:53:04.581
EVEN A LITTLE HOPE LESS.

00:53:04.648 --> 00:53:06.283
WE KNOW THAT ONE IN THREE PEOPLE

00:53:06.349 --> 00:53:07.751
WILL EXPERIENCE VIOLENCE IN A

00:53:07.817 --> 00:53:08.985
RELATIONSHIP AT SOME POINT IN

00:53:09.052 --> 00:53:10.387
THEIR LIVES.

00:53:10.453 --> 00:53:12.055
THAT IS A STAGGERING NUMBER.

00:53:12.122 --> 00:53:13.423
WE ALSO KNOW THAT IT TAKES AN

00:53:13.490 --> 00:53:14.858
AVERAGE OF SEVEN TIMES TO LEAVE

00:53:14.925 --> 00:53:16.660
AN ABUSIVE PARTNER.

00:53:16.726 --> 00:53:18.094
BUT THERE IS LIGHT AT THE END OF

00:53:18.161 --> 00:53:18.962
THE TUNNEL.

00:53:19.029 --> 00:53:21.164
PREVENTION BRINGS HOPE TO THE

00:53:21.231 --> 00:53:22.365
CHALLENGING IN OFTENTIMES

00:53:22.432 --> 00:53:24.367

EVERY DAY WITH VICTIMS.

00:53:25.769 --> 00:53:26.836
BY BEING BRAVE ENOUGH TO HAVE

00:53:26.903 --> 00:53:27.904
THESE CONVERSATIONS WITH YOUNG

00:53:27.971 --> 00:53:29.406
PEOPLE WE ARE ABLE TO ELIMINATE

00:53:29.472 --> 00:53:30.840

00:53:32.776 --> 00:53:33.510
THEM TO BREAK THE

00:53:33.577 --> 00:53:36.680
INTERGENERATIONAL CYCLE OF ABUSE.

00:53:36.746 --> 00:53:38.214
WE ALSO KNOW THAT WILL IT WILL

00:53:38.281 --> 00:53:39.816
TAKE A LONG TIME BEFORE WE SEE A

00:53:39.883 --> 00:53:41.184
SUBSTANTIAL DECREASE AND

00:53:41.251 --> 00:53:42.419

00:54:55.825 --> 00:54:57.360
THIS YEAR WE HAD STUDENTS FROM

BYSTANDER INTERVENTION IS A

00:55:06.369 --> 00:55:07.904
REALISTIC AND REASONABLE

00:55:07.971 --> 00:55:09.105
APPROACH PREVENTION.

00:55:09.172 --> 00:55:10.573
WHILE PREVENTING ALL ACTS OF

00:55:13.743 --> 00:55:15.378
FEEL OUT OF REACH CREATING

00:55:15.445 --> 00:55:16.646
ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH PEOPLE WHO

00:55:16.713 --> 00:55:18.348
MIGHT HARM OTHERS DO NOT BELIEVE

00:55:18.415 --> 00:55:19.482
THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH IT.

00:55:19.549 --> 00:55:21.384
IS ATTAINABLE.

00:55:21.451 --> 00:55:22.719
CHOOSING A STEP IN CAN AFFECT

00:55:22.786 --> 00:55:24.087
HOW OTHERS AROUND US THINK ABOUT

00:55:24.154 --> 00:55:26.556
AND RESPOND TO HARMFUL BEHAVIORS.

00:55:26.623 --> 00:55:27.590
THAT'S WHY WE WORK WITH SCHOOL

00:55:27.657 --> 00:55:29.125
COUNSELORS AND ASK THEM TO

00:55:29.192 --> 00:55:30.026

00:55:34.531 --> 00:55:35.732
WE GET THE STUDENTS IN A ROOM

00:55:35.799 --> 00:55:37.801
TOGETHER AND WE ENCOURAGE THEM

00:55:37.867 --> 00:55:38.968

00:55:41.071 --> 00:55:42.605
USE THEIR VOICES FOR POSITIVE

00:55:42.672 --> 00:55:45.775
CHANGE AN ACT AS ROLE MODELS.

00:55:45.842 --> 00:55:46.743
AT FIRST WHEN STUDENTS ARRIVE AT

00:55:48.078 --> 00:55:49.479
GUARDED AND MAYBE EVEN A LITTLE

00:55:49.546 --> 00:55:50.547
SKEPTICAL.

00:55:50.613 --> 00:55:51.881
BUT ONCE WE'VE GOTTEN THEM TO

00:55:51.948 --> 00:55:53.616
TAKE OFF THEIR COOL JACKETS THE

00:55:53.683 --> 00:55:55.151
TRANSFORMATION THROUGHOUT THE

00:55:55.218 --> 00:55:56.419

WE ASK THEM AT THE END OF THE

00:56:02.992 --> 00:56:04.894
DAY TO ANONYMOUSLY SHARE ONE

00:56:04.961 --> 00:56:06.463

AS WELL AS REALLY THE FIRST OF

00:59:15.618 --> 00:59:16.920
ITS KIND OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT

THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND

00:59:30.533 --> 00:59:32.035
PREVENTION IS IMPORTANT NOT ONLY

00:59:32.101 --> 00:59:34.203
BECAUSE WE WANT TO PREVENT YOUNG

00:59:34.270 --> 00:59:36.005
PEOPLE FROM EXPERIENCING

00:59:36.072 --> 00:59:37.373

00:59:41.344 --> 00:59:42.178
THEM NOW.

00:59:42.245 --> 00:59:43.513
AND WE CAN LOOK AT PREVENTION A

00:59:43.579 --> 00:59:44.781
COUPLE OF DIFFERENT WAYS WE CAN

00:59:44.847 --> 00:59:46.649
LOOK AT IT AS YOU KNOW WHAT CAN

00:59:46.716 --> 00:59:48.184
WE DO TO TRY AND PREVENT AN

IS ALREADY DEALT WITH THIS.

00:59:53.656 --> 00:59:55.158
BUT ALSO HOW CAN WE DO PRIMARY

00:59:55.224 --> 00:59:57.460
PREVENTION AND TRAIN US STOP IT

00:59:57.527 --> 00:59:58.861
FROM HAPPENING IN THE FIRST

00:59:58.928 --> 01:00:01.631

HEALTH ISSUE.

01:00:06.035 --> 01:00:08.137
I IT DOESN'T JUST AFFECT THE TWO

01:00:08.204 --> 01:00:09.505
PEOPLE INVOLVED IT SPILLS OUT

01:00:09.572 --> 01:00:10.974
INTO THE COMMUNITY THERE'S

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:12.742
EMERGING RESEARCH THAT THERE'S A

01:00:12.809 --> 01:00:13.943
STRONG CONNECTION TO GUN

01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:16.212

TO GUN VIOLENCE AND WE KNOW THAT

01:00:25.621 --> 01:00:26.189
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S

01:00:26.255 --> 01:00:27.857
IMPACTING OUR COMMUNITIES AND

01:00:27.924 --> 01:00:28.624
OUR SCHOOLS.

01:00:28.691 --> 01:00:30.793
AND ONE THING WE CAN DO TO HELP

01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:32.795
ADDRESS THAT ISSUE IS TALK ABOUT

01:00:32.862 --> 01:00:34.697
THE PREVENTION OF SEXUAL

01:00:34.764 --> 01:00:37.867
VIOLENCE AND DATING VIOLENCE --

01:00:37.934 --> 01:00:39.802

01:00:39.869 --> 01:00:40.670
AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE AGAIN JUST

01:00:40.737 --> 01:00:43.039
HAVE SO MANY SHARED RISK FACTORS

01:00:43.106 --> 01:00:44.741
AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS WITH

01:00:44.807 --> 01:00:46.342
OTHER ISSUES THAT WE CARE ABOUT

01:00:46.409 --> 01:00:47.577
IN OUR COMMUNITIES.

01:00:47.643 --> 01:00:49.712
LIKE GANG VIOLENCE LIKE SUICIDE

01:00:49.779 --> 01:00:51.280
LIKE UNWANTED PREGNANCIES THAT

01:00:51.347 --> 01:00:52.648
AGAIN IF WE COULD JUST KIND OF

01:00:52.715 --> 01:00:54.851
TALK TO YOUNG PEOPLE ABOUT

01:00:54.917 --> 01:00:56.386
BUILDING HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS.

01:00:56.452 --> 01:00:58.121
WE COULD HAVE THIS HUGE RIPPLE

01:00:58.187 --> 01:01:00.289
EFFECT INTO OTHER ISSUES SO WHAT

01:01:00.356 --> 01:01:01.457
I WANTED TO SPEND A LITTLE BIT

01:01:01.524 --> 01:01:03.359
OF TIME DOING WAS TO TELL YOU

01:01:03.426 --> 01:01:05.795

01:01:05.862 --> 01:01:07.230
DIFFERENT PREVENTION PROGRAMS WE

01:01:07.296 --> 01:01:09.098
DO AT PEACE OVER VIOLENCE JUST

01:01:09.165 --> 01:01:09.532
TO SHOW.

01:01:09.599 --> 01:01:10.600
THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF

01:01:10.666 --> 01:01:11.901
DIFFERENT OPTIONS FOR IT AND

01:01:11.968 --> 01:01:13.236
THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS TO GO

01:01:13.302 --> 01:01:17.840
ABOUT IT -- SO.

01:01:17.907 --> 01:01:18.508
I WANTED TO START WITH SOME OF

01:01:18.574 --> 01:01:19.108
OUR SCHOOL BASED PROGRAM JUST

01:01:19.175 --> 01:01:20.343
BECAUSE THAT IS A REALLY GREAT

01:01:20.410 --> 01:01:22.812
WAY TO WORK WITH YOUTH DIRECTLY

01:01:22.879 --> 01:01:24.714
AS WITH THE SCHOOLS SO.

01:01:24.781 --> 01:01:26.449
WE WORKED MOST CLOSELY WITH LOS

01:01:26.516 --> 01:01:28.618
ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT

STAFF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

01:01:37.026 --> 01:01:40.329
STUDENTS -- AND THE UNFORTUNATE

01:01:40.396 --> 01:01:41.864
FACT IS THAT WE CAN'T REACH THEM

01:01:41.931 --> 01:01:43.866
ALL BECAUSE OF THAT SIZE AND SO

01:01:43.933 --> 01:01:44.634
PART OF WHAT WE'RE REALLY

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:46.069
LOOKING FOR IN TRYING TO

01:01:46.135 --> 01:01:47.537

01:02:19.535 --> 01:02:21.070
STUDENTS NOT ONLY LEARN THE

01:02:21.137 --> 01:02:22.538

BOUNDARIES AND CONSENT HOW TO

01:02:29.645 --> 01:02:31.314
UNDERSTAND -- HOW THEY SEE

COLLEGE CAMPUSES AND ACTUALLY --

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:45.094
WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH SOME OF

01:02:45.161 --> 01:02:45.962
THE STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN

01:02:46.028 --> 01:02:48.131

SCHOOLS -- NOT ONLY TO MAKE IT

01:03:07.783 --> 01:03:08.985
MANDATORY BUT TO SAY THAT.

01:03:09.051 --> 01:03:10.286
STUDENTS HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT

01:03:10.353 --> 01:03:15.224
SEXUAL ASSAULT THEY HAVE TO

01:03:15.291 --> 01:03:15.858
LEARN ABOUT -- HEALTHY

RELATIONSHIP SKILLS AND A LOT OF

01:03:16.926 --> 01:03:17.059
THEM.

01:03:17.126 --> 01:03:17.627
THEY DON'T HAVE ALREADY THE

01:03:17.693 --> 01:03:18.961
CURRICULUM TO DO THAT AND SO

01:03:19.028 --> 01:03:20.396
THEY'VE BEEN CALLING US TO HELP

01:03:20.463 --> 01:03:22.698
SUPPLEMENT THAT PART OF THE SEX

01:03:22.765 --> 01:03:25.168
THAT EDUCATION -- BUT AGAIN

01:03:25.234 --> 01:03:26.402
THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES LIKE

01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:27.837
WITH PASADENA UNIFIED SCHOOL

01:03:27.904 --> 01:03:29.872
DISTRICT ANOTHER -- DISTRICT

01:03:29.939 --> 01:03:31.774
WITHIN OUR SERVICE AREA BECAUSE

01:03:31.841 --> 01:03:33.176
OF BUDGET CUTS THAT THAT

01:03:33.242 --> 01:03:34.710
DISTRICTS SPECIFICALLY HAS BEEN

01:03:34.777 --> 01:03:35.578
SEEING.

01:03:35.645 --> 01:03:37.980
THEY'VE CUT HEALTH CLASSES AND

01:03:38.047 --> 01:03:40.249
SO IT'S IT'S REALLY ABOUT LIKE

01:03:40.316 --> 01:03:42.218
WE HAVE MATH TEACHERS TRYING TO

01:03:42.285 --> 01:03:43.619
TEACH SEX ED AND HEALTHY

01:03:43.686 --> 01:03:45.154
RELATIONSHIPS NOT TO SAY THAT

01:03:45.221 --> 01:03:46.789
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT IT OR

01:03:46.856 --> 01:03:47.323
CAN'T DO IT.

01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:49.358
BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S JUST SO

01:03:49.425 --> 01:03:52.128
MUCH COMPETITION FOR THIS -- WE

01:03:52.195 --> 01:03:53.596
ALSO DO CYCLE EDUCATIONAL GROUPS

01:03:53.663 --> 01:03:55.831
WITH YOUNG PEOPLE WHO PERHAPS

01:03:55.898 --> 01:03:57.567
ARE AT HIGH RISK OF BEING

01:03:57.633 --> 01:03:59.535
VICTIMIZED OR OF VICTIMIZING

01:03:59.602 --> 01:04:02.171
OTHERS -- AND A LOT OF TIMES

01:04:02.238 --> 01:04:03.706
THOSE GROUPS ARE GENDER SPECIFIC

01:04:03.773 --> 01:04:05.374
SO WE ARE WORKING SPECIFICALLY

01:04:05.441 --> 01:04:06.609
WITH YOUNG MEN.

01:04:06.676 --> 01:04:08.844
SO THAT WE CAN TALK TO THEM

01:04:08.911 --> 01:04:10.580
ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO BUILD

01:04:10.646 --> 01:04:12.081
HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS ADDRESSING

01:04:12.148 --> 01:04:14.350
LIKE TOXIC MASCULINITY THAT.

01:04:14.417 --> 01:04:15.985
BEING A MAN DOESN'T HAVE TO MEAN

01:04:16.052 --> 01:04:17.720
BEING AGGRESSIVE AND VIOLENT AND

01:04:17.787 --> 01:04:19.956
DOMINATING TOWARDS WOMEN AND

01:04:20.022 --> 01:04:20.923
ADDRESSING LIKE HETERO

01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:22.124
NORMATIVITY IN SOME OF THE

01:04:22.191 --> 01:04:24.093
HOMOPHOBIA WITH YOUNG BOYS AND

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:25.394
REALLY TRYING TO CONNECT THEM TO

01:04:25.461 --> 01:04:27.196
ADULT MALE MENTORS.

01:04:27.263 --> 01:04:29.432
WHO CAN MODEL TO THEM WHAT IT

01:04:29.498 --> 01:04:31.534
MEANS TO BE A HEALTHY MAN -- AND

01:04:31.601 --> 01:04:33.869
AND HAVE HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS --

01:04:33.936 --> 01:04:35.338
AND WE ALSO DO CAMPAIGNS WITH

01:04:35.404 --> 01:04:37.106
THE STUDENTS ACROSS THE SCHOOLS

01:04:37.173 --> 01:04:38.975
LIKE DENIM DAY SO LA UNIFIED IN

01:04:39.041 --> 01:04:41.110
A LOT OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS --

01:04:41.177 --> 01:04:42.578
PROCLAIM DENIM DAY FOR THE

01:04:42.645 --> 01:04:43.746
DISTRICTS AND HAVE THEIR

01:04:43.813 --> 01:04:46.048
TEACHERS AND STUDENTS WHERE

01:04:46.115 --> 01:04:47.984
THESE KINDS OF THINGS -- AND WE

01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:49.585
DO EMPOWERMENT SELF DEFENSE FOR

01:04:49.652 --> 01:04:51.087
GIRLS ALSO WHICH I THINK IS

01:04:51.153 --> 01:04:53.256
REALLY COOL AND WE TRY AND

01:04:53.322 --> 01:04:54.590
INJECT A LOT OF PREVENTION

01:04:54.657 --> 01:04:55.992
STRATEGIES IN THERE THAT IT'S

01:04:56.058 --> 01:04:56.826
NOT JUST ABOUT.

01:04:56.892 --> 01:04:58.561
LIKE THE PHYSICAL TECHNIQUES OF

01:04:58.628 --> 01:04:59.929
LEARNING HOW TO DEFEND YOURSELF

01:04:59.996 --> 01:05:01.530
BUT REALLY TO TALK ABOUT IT'S

01:05:01.597 --> 01:05:03.165
OKAY TO BE ASSERTIVE IT'S OKAY

01:05:03.232 --> 01:05:05.234
TO SET BOUNDARIES -- AND HOW TO

01:05:05.301 --> 01:05:06.435
BE AWARE OF YOUR SURROUNDINGS

01:05:06.502 --> 01:05:08.004
THINGS LIKE THAT AND THEN WE

01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:09.972
ALSO FOCUS A LOT ON LEADERSHIP

01:05:10.039 --> 01:05:13.909
DEVELOPMENT WITH YOUNG PEOPLE SO

01:05:13.976 --> 01:05:14.543
WE ALSO HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE DOING

01:05:14.610 --> 01:05:16.479
PER GRAMS AT OUR OFFICE -- AND

01:05:16.545 --> 01:05:17.046
THROUGHOUT THEIR SCHOOLS TO

01:05:17.113 --> 01:05:18.914
BUILD THEIR LEADERSHIP SKILLS

01:05:18.981 --> 01:05:20.750
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT.

01:05:20.816 --> 01:05:22.285
THE MORE EMPOWERED THAT YOUNG

01:05:22.351 --> 01:05:23.753
PEOPLE FEEL THE MORE OF THESE

01:05:23.819 --> 01:05:24.987
LIKE DEVELOPMENTAL AND

01:05:25.054 --> 01:05:26.856
LEADERSHIP SKILLS THAT THEY HAVE

01:05:26.922 --> 01:05:28.524
THE LESS VULNERABLE THEY ARE TOO

01:05:28.591 --> 01:05:30.293
AGAIN PERPETRATE VIOLENCE OR TO

01:05:30.359 --> 01:05:32.395
BE VICTIMIZED BY A VIOLENT SO --

01:05:32.461 --> 01:05:34.063
WE HAVE A SCHOOL BASED PROGRAM

01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:35.931
CALLED STOP CLUBS THAT STANDS

01:05:35.998 --> 01:05:37.700
FOR STUDENTS TOGETHER ORGANIZING

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:40.536
PIECE -- AND THAT'S FOR STUDENTS --

01:05:40.603 --> 01:05:42.171
ON THEIR SCHOOL CAMPUSES TO

01:05:42.238 --> 01:05:43.639
REALLY TAKE THESE ACTIVITIES

01:05:43.706 --> 01:05:46.008
INTO THEIR HANDS AND DECIDE WHAT

01:05:46.075 --> 01:05:46.842
DO THEY WANT TO DO FOR THEIR

01:05:46.909 --> 01:05:48.444
SPECIFIC COMMUNITY BECAUSE NOT

EVERY SCHOOL IS DEALING WITH A

01:05:51.547 --> 01:05:53.516
DIFFERENT ISSUE -- AND WE HAD A

LIFE I ALSO PRO I'M PROVIDING

01:06:02.358 --> 01:06:03.526
FOR YOU TODAY.

01:06:03.592 --> 01:06:04.994

01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:28.317
TO FEEL LIKE HE COULD BE A

01:06:28.384 --> 01:06:30.219

01:10:17.513 --> 01:10:19.748
AMERICAN -- AND SHE WAS REALLY

01:10:19.815 --> 01:10:21.483
CONCERNED ABOUT HOW HER DAD

01:10:21.550 --> 01:10:23.285
WOULD REACT WHEN HE FOUND OUT

01:10:23.352 --> 01:10:27.189
THAT SHE HAD BEEN SEXUALLY

01:10:27.256 --> 01:10:29.258
ASSAULTED -- AND WAS LIKE

01:10:29.325 --> 01:10:29.959
BEGGING US NOT TO TELL HIM

01:10:30.025 --> 01:10:32.227

MIGHT MEAN TO THEM AND SO IT CAN

01:10:41.203 --> 01:10:42.871
BE REALLY DIFFICULT AND I THINK

01:10:42.938 --> 01:10:45.107
THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT -- TO

BRIEFLY LIKE KIND OF OUTLINE

01:11:18.707 --> 01:11:21.377

WITH THE COMMUNITY AND SO I'M

01:13:16.825 --> 01:13:17.426
TELLING THEM WHAT TO DO KIND OF

01:13:17.493 --> 01:13:18.660

01:13:57.566 --> 01:14:01.570

AND WHAT IS HEALTHY AND WHAT

01:14:08.644 --> 01:14:11.146
ISN'T AND OFTENTIMES CERTAIN

01:14:11.213 --> 01:14:14.783

01:14:18.887 --> 01:14:24.226
JEALOUSY OR SO BEING ABLE. TO TO

01:14:24.293 --> 01:14:25.494

01:14:30.132 --> 01:14:31.600
TO NAVIGATE AND SO THE MORE

01:14:31.667 --> 01:14:33.168
OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE TO TALK

EACH OTHER OUR LESSONS LEARNED

01:20:11.439 --> 01:20:13.375
IN OUR BEST PRACTICES AND WHAT'S

01:20:13.441 --> 01:20:15.177
SURPRISING IS DESPITE HOW

01:20:15.243 --> 01:20:16.611
DIFFERENT OUR COMMUNITIES ARE.

01:20:16.678 --> 01:20:18.079
THERE ARE SIMILARITIES IN THE

01:20:18.146 --> 01:20:19.414
WAY WE ARE SERVING ARE

01:20:19.481 --> 01:20:21.049
VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES SO

01:20:21.116 --> 01:20:22.584
WHETHER YOU'RE IN CENTRAL VALLEY

01:20:22.651 --> 01:20:25.120
WORKING WITH AMONG SHAMANS OR IN

01:20:25.187 --> 01:20:26.421
OAKLAND WORKING WITH BLACK

01:20:26.488 --> 01:20:27.422
CHURCHES.

01:20:27.489 --> 01:20:28.657
ARE BASICALLY ANYWHERE IN

01:20:28.723 --> 01:20:30.292
CALIFORNIA WORKING WITH LATINO

01:20:30.358 --> 01:20:31.126
PRIEST.

01:20:31.193 --> 01:20:33.061
FAITH LEADERS ARE UNIQUELY

01:20:33.128 --> 01:20:35.063
POSITIONED TO INFLUENCE CULTURAL

01:20:35.130 --> 01:20:36.598
NORMS AND SERVE AS FIRST

01:20:36.665 --> 01:20:39.834
RESPONDERS TO FAMILIES IN CRISIS.

01:20:39.901 --> 01:20:40.802
SO THERE'S A LOT OF TRUST

01:20:40.869 --> 01:20:42.537
BUILDING THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN

01:20:42.604 --> 01:20:44.172
WHEN YOU WORK WITH FAITH LEADERS.

01:20:44.239 --> 01:20:46.374
CREE INJURE CHURCHES IN GENERAL

01:20:46.441 --> 01:20:47.442
WE HOLD THE HOLD.

01:20:47.509 --> 01:20:49.377
CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIAN VALUES

01:20:49.444 --> 01:20:51.079
AND FEEL THEIR ROLE IS TO PUT

01:20:51.146 --> 01:20:52.948
THE FAMILY FIRST WHEREAS IN THE

01:20:53.014 --> 01:20:54.749
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FIELD WHERE

01:20:54.816 --> 01:20:56.451
PROGRESSIVE FEMINIST BASED

01:20:56.518 --> 01:20:58.420
MOVEMENT WAY PUT THE SURVIVOR AT

01:20:58.486 --> 01:20:59.454
THE CENTER.

01:20:59.521 --> 01:21:00.855
SO CAN BE CHALLENGING REACHING

01:21:00.922 --> 01:21:02.457
ACROSS THE AISLE AT TIMES WHEN

01:21:02.524 --> 01:21:06.528
VALUES AND PERSPECTIVES SEEMS SO

01:21:06.595 --> 01:21:07.229
DISPARATE.

01:21:07.295 --> 01:21:07.762
SOMETHING TRANSFORMATIONAL

01:21:07.829 --> 01:21:08.697
HAPPENS WHEN YOU BRING A GROUP

01:21:08.763 --> 01:21:10.365
OF FAITH LEADERS TOGETHER AND

01:21:10.432 --> 01:21:11.900
LET THEM TALK TOGETHER ABOUT

01:21:11.967 --> 01:21:13.335
WITH TV LOOKS LIKE IN THEIR

01:21:13.401 --> 01:21:14.569
COMMUNITIES.

01:21:14.636 --> 01:21:15.737
SO WHEN WE HAVE A TWO DAY

01:21:15.804 --> 01:21:18.340
RETREAT AND FEMALE FAITH LEADERS

01:21:18.406 --> 01:21:20.208
CHOOSE TO SET UP TILL TWO AM IN

01:21:20.275 --> 01:21:21.977
THE MORNING SO THEY CAN CONTINUE

01:21:22.043 --> 01:21:23.478
SHARING STORIES.

01:21:23.545 --> 01:21:24.779
SOMETHING MAGICAL HAPPENS IN

01:21:24.846 --> 01:21:26.481
THAT MOMENT BECAUSE WHAT THEY'RE

01:21:26.548 --> 01:21:28.250
DOING IS THEY'RE TAKING THE DB

01:21:28.316 --> 01:21:29.918
EDUCATION THAT THEY'VE LEARNED

01:21:29.985 --> 01:21:31.386
FROM EARLIER IN THAT DAY.

01:21:31.453 --> 01:21:33.888
AND THEY'RE TURNING IT INTO A

01:21:33.955 --> 01:21:34.756
PERSONAL REFLECTION.

01:21:34.823 --> 01:21:38.460
ON HOW THEY OR THOSE AROUND THEM

01:21:38.526 --> 01:21:39.794
HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY TV.

01:21:39.861 --> 01:21:40.695
AND TV SHOULD BE A PERSONAL

01:21:40.762 --> 01:21:43.798
DISCUSSION BECAUSE EVERYONE HAS

01:21:43.865 --> 01:21:45.267
BEEN IMPACTED BY IT.

01:21:45.333 --> 01:21:47.068
WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT ONE IN

01:21:47.135 --> 01:21:49.204
THREE WOMEN EXPERIENCE TV IN HER

01:21:49.271 --> 01:21:51.406
LIFETIME HOW CAN IT NOT BE

01:21:51.473 --> 01:21:54.142
SOMETHING PERSONAL TO ALL OF US?

01:21:54.209 --> 01:21:56.011
STATISTICALLY SPEAKING UNLESS

01:21:56.077 --> 01:21:57.612
YOU LIVE ALONE IN A DESERTED

01:21:57.679 --> 01:22:00.382
ISLAND WE ARE ALL CONNECTED TO

01:22:00.448 --> 01:22:01.916
SOMEONE WHO HAS EXPERIENCE TV

01:22:01.983 --> 01:22:03.585
WHETHER IT'S A RELATIVE OR

01:22:03.652 --> 01:22:05.920
FRIEND A COLLEAGUE OF CONGRESS

01:22:05.987 --> 01:22:08.456
OR OUR AND THAT'S THE VALUE OF

01:22:08.523 --> 01:22:09.991
PREVENTION WORK IT TAKES WE SEE.

01:22:10.058 --> 01:22:11.559
IT TAKES WHAT SEEMS LIKE AN

01:22:11.626 --> 01:22:14.162
ABSTRACT SOCIETAL ILL AND IT

01:22:14.229 --> 01:22:15.864
TURNS IT INTO SOMETHING DEEPLY

01:22:15.930 --> 01:22:17.599
PERSONAL THAT EVERYONE CAN

01:22:17.666 --> 01:22:20.235
RELATE TO AND WANT TO FIX.

01:22:20.302 --> 01:22:22.270
LAST YEAR WHEN I TESTIFIED I

01:22:22.337 --> 01:22:23.972
SHARED WITH SOME OF YOU MY OWN

01:22:24.039 --> 01:22:26.141
PERSONAL STORY ABOUT COMING FROM

01:22:26.207 --> 01:22:28.243
A FAMILY WITH THREE GENERATIONS

01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:29.811
OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.

01:22:29.878 --> 01:22:31.479
HOW MY MOTHER GREW UP WITH AN

01:22:31.546 --> 01:22:32.781
ABUSIVE FATHER?

01:22:32.847 --> 01:22:33.782
AND ONE DAY WHEN SHE WAS A

01:22:33.848 --> 01:22:38.520
TEENAGER.

01:22:38.586 --> 01:22:40.488
SHE WENT TO HER ROOM.

01:22:40.555 --> 01:22:42.090
AND SHE SLIT HER WRISTS.

01:22:42.157 --> 01:22:43.725
AND SHE WROTE A MESSAGE TO HER

01:22:43.792 --> 01:22:46.394
FATHER WITH HER OWN BLOOD.

01:22:46.461 --> 01:22:47.429
AND SHE SAID THAT IF SHE EVER

01:22:47.495 --> 01:22:48.830
SAW MY GRANDFATHER HIT MY

01:22:48.897 --> 01:22:50.432
GRANDMOTHER AGAIN SHE WOULD KILL

01:22:50.498 --> 01:22:52.867
HERSELF.

01:22:52.934 --> 01:22:54.169
I SHARED HOW THEIR FAMILY

01:22:54.235 --> 01:22:56.171
MEMBERS AROUND ME WHO EXPERIENCE

01:22:56.237 --> 01:22:57.605
TV.

01:22:57.672 --> 01:22:59.274
AND HOW I WORRY THAT TV MIGHT

01:22:59.341 --> 01:23:00.709
PASS ALONG TO THE FOURTH

01:23:00.775 --> 01:23:03.478
GENERATION OF MY CHILDREN AND MY

01:23:03.545 --> 01:23:05.814
NIECES AND NEPHEWS.

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:07.349
WHAT I DIDN'T SHARE WAS THAT

01:23:07.415 --> 01:23:08.450
WHEN I STARTED AT DICK AT CAPE

01:23:08.516 --> 01:23:11.252
DAM IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME THAT

01:23:11.319 --> 01:23:12.454
TV WAS A PERSONAL ISSUE?

01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:14.089
MY PARENTS WERE NOT ABUSIVE

01:23:14.155 --> 01:23:15.690
TOWARDS IT THEN IT TOWARDS EACH

01:23:15.757 --> 01:23:17.325
OTHER I HAD NEVER BEEN AN

01:23:17.392 --> 01:23:18.893
ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP.

01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:20.428
THEREFORE IT SEEMS LIKE AN

01:23:20.495 --> 01:23:22.097
ABSTRACT PROBLEM.

01:23:22.163 --> 01:23:23.865
IT WAS ONLY AFTER I STARTED

01:23:23.932 --> 01:23:25.834
WORKING AT QUE PFAM DID I START

01:23:25.900 --> 01:23:27.335
TO REALIZE THAT MY FAMILY'S

01:23:27.402 --> 01:23:30.505
HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE WITH TV

01:23:30.572 --> 01:23:32.374
WAS OF COURSE PERSONAL.

01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:33.842
AND EVEN IF I NEVER WITNESSED

01:23:33.908 --> 01:23:35.977
ABUSE MYSELF KNOWING THAT MY

01:23:36.044 --> 01:23:37.946
GRANDFATHER'S ABUSE HAS LEFT A

01:23:38.012 --> 01:23:40.081
LEGACY THAT'S BEEN PASSED FROM

01:23:40.148 --> 01:23:42.150
GENERATION TO GENERATION DOWN

01:23:42.217 --> 01:23:43.585
OUR FAMILY TREE.

01:23:43.651 --> 01:23:46.054
NOW MAKES IT A DEEPLY PERSONAL

01:23:46.121 --> 01:23:47.922
ISSUE.

01:23:47.989 --> 01:23:49.991
EVERYONE OF THE FAITH LEADERS WE

01:23:50.058 --> 01:23:51.760
TRAIN AT KEITH THEM KNOW SOMEONE

01:23:51.826 --> 01:23:52.927
WHO HAS BEEN A VICTIM OR

01:23:52.994 --> 01:23:55.130
PERPETRATOR OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.

01:23:55.196 --> 01:23:56.698
ALTHOUGH MOST DO NOT REAL

01:23:56.765 --> 01:23:58.600
RECOGNIZE THAT BEFORE THEY COME

01:23:58.666 --> 01:23:59.634
TO OUR TRAINING.

01:23:59.701 --> 01:24:02.704
BUT THEN WE START TO TALK ABOUT

01:24:02.771 --> 01:24:04.105
KOREAN COMMUNITIES.

01:24:04.172 --> 01:24:05.840
AND HOW THE INTERGENERATIONAL

01:24:05.907 --> 01:24:08.042
CYCLE OF VIOLENCE HAS A LONG

01:24:08.109 --> 01:24:10.378
TERM DEVASTATING IMPACT ON OUR

01:24:10.445 --> 01:24:11.913
CHILDREN.

01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:13.648
WHO GO ON TO REPEAT WHAT THEY

01:24:13.715 --> 01:24:15.350
SAW WITH THEIR PARENTS?

01:24:15.417 --> 01:24:16.050
AND THAT'S WHEN OUR FAITH LEADER

01:24:16.117 --> 01:24:17.552
START TO THINK ABOUTTHEIR OWN

01:24:17.619 --> 01:24:19.154
FAMILIES AND THEIR OWN

01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:21.256
CHILDHOODS AND THEIR OWN FRIENDS

01:24:21.322 --> 01:24:22.524
AND THEIR CONGREGANTS AND THEY

01:24:22.590 --> 01:24:24.325
REALIZE THAT THEY WERE PATTERNS

01:24:24.392 --> 01:24:27.228
AND SIGNS OF ABUSE EVERYWHERE

01:24:27.295 --> 01:24:28.329
AROUND THEM.

01:24:28.396 --> 01:24:29.731
AFTER THE TRAININGS WE SEE AN

01:24:29.798 --> 01:24:31.533
INCREASE IN REFERRALS BECAUSE

01:24:31.599 --> 01:24:33.134
THE FAITH LEADERS KNOW NOW HOW

01:24:33.201 --> 01:24:34.669
TO IDENTIFY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:24:34.736 --> 01:24:36.604
BEYOND A BLACK GUY OR HOSPITAL

01:24:36.671 --> 01:24:37.605
VISITS.

01:24:37.672 --> 01:24:38.807
AND THEY KNOW HOW TO APPROACH

01:24:38.873 --> 01:24:41.276
THE SUBJECT OF GETTING SOMEONE

01:24:41.342 --> 01:24:43.511
TO A TV AGENCY FOR HELP.

01:24:43.578 --> 01:24:46.014
RATHER THAN LIMITING THEIR

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:47.081
INTERVENTION TO PRAYER ALONE.

01:24:47.148 --> 01:24:48.883
LAST YEAR KPM SERVED A HUNDRED

01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:50.118
CREE AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:24:50.185 --> 01:24:52.620
SURVIVORS THIS IS THE HIGHEST

01:24:52.687 --> 01:24:54.923
NUMBER WE HAVE EVER SERVED AND A

01:24:54.989 --> 01:24:57.425
33% INCREASE FROM PAST YEARS.

01:24:57.492 --> 01:24:59.194
MANYOF THOSE REFERRALS CAME TO

01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:01.229
US THROUGH THE FAITH LEADERS WHO

01:25:01.296 --> 01:25:03.097
HAD RECEIVED OUR TRAINING. FOR

01:25:03.164 --> 01:25:04.098
MORE THAN JUST THE UP TAKEN

01:25:04.165 --> 01:25:06.601
REFERRALS THERE'S A SLOWER

01:25:06.668 --> 01:25:09.204
SUDLER BUT EVEN MORE PROFOUND

01:25:09.270 --> 01:25:10.705
CHANGE THAT'S OCCURRING THROUGH

01:25:10.772 --> 01:25:11.806
THESE TRAININGS.

01:25:11.873 --> 01:25:13.541
BECAUSE AS FAITH LEADERS CHANGE

01:25:13.608 --> 01:25:15.343
THE WAY THEY THINK ABOUT THE

01:25:15.410 --> 01:25:16.578
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THEY START

01:25:16.644 --> 01:25:18.913
TALKING AND PREACHING ABOUT HOW

01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:20.915
EVIL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS.

01:25:20.982 --> 01:25:22.984
HOW IT DESTROYS OUR FAMILIES AND

01:25:23.051 --> 01:25:25.153
HOW THERE IS NO PLACE FOR IT IN

01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:26.588
A CHRISTIAN FAMILY?

01:25:26.654 --> 01:25:28.289
WHEREAS THE STARTED OFF

01:25:28.356 --> 01:25:30.091
BELIEVING THAT TV MUST BE IN

01:25:30.158 --> 01:25:32.393
TOUR FOR THE SAKE OF PROTECTING

01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:34.529
A FAMILY ONCE THEY GET TRAINED

01:25:34.596 --> 01:25:36.464
THEY REALIZE SAID TV MUST BE

01:25:36.531 --> 01:25:39.534
STOPPED FOR THE SAKE OF THE

01:25:39.601 --> 01:25:40.034
FAMILY.

01:25:40.101 --> 01:25:41.336
THIS CHANGE MENTALITIES BEING

01:25:41.402 --> 01:25:43.538
SPREAD BY ARGUABLY THE MOST

01:25:43.605 --> 01:25:45.940
INFLUENCE INFLUENTIAL LEADERS OF

01:25:46.007 --> 01:25:47.709
OUR CLEAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY.

01:25:47.775 --> 01:25:48.810
AND I SEE ARGUABLY BECAUSE NOW

01:25:48.877 --> 01:25:50.879
WE HAVE BTS THAT'S TAKING OVER

01:25:50.945 --> 01:25:52.680
THE WORLD.

01:25:52.747 --> 01:25:54.315
BECAUSE NO MATTER HOW MANY

01:25:54.382 --> 01:25:57.385
CRISIS CALLS KVM ANSWERS HOW

01:25:57.452 --> 01:25:59.888
MANY SAFETY PLANS WE CREATE OR

01:25:59.954 --> 01:26:01.823
HOW MANY RESTRAINING ORDERS WE

01:26:01.890 --> 01:26:02.891
FILE.

01:26:02.957 --> 01:26:04.125
THOSE WILL NOT LEAD OUR

01:26:04.192 --> 01:26:05.894
COMMUNITY TO END DOMESTIC

01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:07.095
VIOLENCE.

01:26:07.161 --> 01:26:09.330
IT'S THE CHANGE IN ATTITUDE

01:26:09.397 --> 01:26:11.633
TOWARDS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WITH

01:26:11.699 --> 01:26:13.268
ART THOUSAND TRAINED FAITH

01:26:13.334 --> 01:26:14.802
LEADERS ARE SPREADING.

01:26:14.869 --> 01:26:16.304
THAT IS WHAT WILL EVENTUALLY

01:26:16.371 --> 01:26:18.106
LEAD TO THE END OF TV IN OUR

01:26:18.172 --> 01:26:19.440
COMMUNITY.

01:26:19.507 --> 01:26:21.442
THAT IS WHY AS A MEMBER OF THE

01:26:21.509 --> 01:26:22.911
CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE DOMESTIC

01:26:22.977 --> 01:26:24.546
VIOLENCE NETWORK AND AS A PART

01:26:24.612 --> 01:26:26.581
OF THE CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP TO

01:26:26.648 --> 01:26:29.317
END DOMESTIC VIOLENCE -- WE A WE

01:26:29.384 --> 01:26:31.252
URGE THE STATE TO CONSIDER HOW

01:26:31.319 --> 01:26:33.354
TO FIND ADDITIONAL DOMESTIC

01:26:33.421 --> 01:26:35.156
VIOLENCE PREVENTION WORK.

01:26:35.223 --> 01:26:36.491
THAT WILL ALLOW NEW AND

01:26:36.558 --> 01:26:37.825
INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS THAT WILL

01:26:37.892 --> 01:26:40.094
REACH UNDERSERVED CULTURALLY

01:26:40.161 --> 01:26:41.696
SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES LIKE OURS.

THE PERPETRATOR THAT COULD BE

01:33:34.742 --> 01:33:36.777
THE INDIVIDUAL OR VICTIM HEARING

01:33:36.844 --> 01:33:37.712

DOMESTIC VIOLENCE -- YOUR

GRANDMOTHER AND AND SOME OF

01:34:08.309 --> 01:34:09.543
THOSE HOW DID HOW DO YOU THEN

01:34:09.610 --> 01:34:11.145
WORK WITHIN THE THE CULTURAL

01:34:11.212 --> 01:34:13.981
ASPECT TO START TO GET AWAY FROM.

01:34:14.048 --> 01:34:15.549
THOSE THINGS I I KNOW THAT IN

01:34:15.616 --> 01:34:18.686
SOME CULTURES IT'S A VERY RUDE --

01:34:18.753 --> 01:34:20.988
ME IN AND AND HOW THINGS ARE ARE

01:34:21.055 --> 01:34:22.823
BEING PERPETRATED BASED ON WHAT

01:34:22.890 --> 01:34:24.725
THEY'VE SEEN PRIOR AND FEEL THAT

01:34:24.792 --> 01:34:26.427
IS PART OF THE THE THE CULTURAL

01:34:26.494 --> 01:34:27.461
ASPECT OF IT.

01:34:27.528 --> 01:34:28.829
SO HOW DO YOU DIVE INTO THAT AND

01:34:28.896 --> 01:34:30.464
START TO CHANGE THAT FROM THE

01:34:30.531 --> 01:34:31.532
ROOT OF THE PROBLEM FROM THE

01:34:31.599 --> 01:34:33.334
BEGINNING RIGHT AND AND I I

01:34:33.401 --> 01:34:34.902
AGREE WITH THAT I AND I'VE

01:34:34.969 --> 01:34:37.171
SPOKEN TO SOME OF MY LATINO

01:34:37.238 --> 01:34:38.606
COUNTERPARTS IN OTHER ADVOCATES

01:34:38.672 --> 01:34:39.206
SAY TALK ABOUT THEM THAT YOU

01:34:39.273 --> 01:34:40.374
SMALL IN THE COMMUNITY.

01:34:40.441 --> 01:34:42.910
AND THE CULTURE AS WELL -- SO

01:34:42.977 --> 01:34:43.978
CREAM CULTURE BEING THAT IS A

01:34:44.045 --> 01:34:47.214
CONFUCIAN PATRIARCHAL THE OTHER

01:34:47.281 --> 01:34:49.550
BASED SOCIETY THERE IS THIS

01:34:49.617 --> 01:34:51.152
HISTORY OF IT BEING VERY MALE

01:34:51.218 --> 01:34:53.354
DOMINATED AND THE FATHER HAS A

01:34:53.421 --> 01:34:53.854
RULE.

01:34:53.921 --> 01:34:55.189
THE WOMAN'S ROLE WAS

01:34:55.256 --> 01:34:57.224
TRADITIONALLY TO OBEY YOUR HOW

01:34:57.291 --> 01:34:58.826
YOUR FATHER THEN WHEN YOU GET

01:34:58.893 --> 01:35:00.661
MARRIED YOU'LL THEIR HOUSE SIGN

01:35:00.728 --> 01:35:01.295
AND THEN WHEN YOU GET OLDER YOU

01:35:01.362 --> 01:35:03.097
I EXCUSE ME YOUR SPOUSE AND THEN

01:35:03.164 --> 01:35:03.597
WHEN YOU GET.

01:35:03.664 --> 01:35:05.433
OLDER YOU'LL BE YOUR SIGN AND

01:35:05.499 --> 01:35:06.567
THAT WAS THE CONFUSION TEACHING

01:35:06.634 --> 01:35:08.102
AND SO THAT'S DEEPLY ROOTED IN

01:35:08.169 --> 01:35:09.236
OUR COMMUNITY.

01:35:09.303 --> 01:35:10.905
SO WHAT WE DO IS WE TALK ABOUT

01:35:10.971 --> 01:35:12.807
WHAT ARE THE HEALTHY PARTS OF

01:35:12.873 --> 01:35:13.574
OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR CURRENT

01:35:13.641 --> 01:35:15.409
CREAM CULTURE THAT WE WANT TO

01:35:15.476 --> 01:35:16.177
KEEP.

01:35:16.243 --> 01:35:18.145
AND WE DO IT WE DO EMBRACE THE

01:35:18.212 --> 01:35:20.047
IDEA OF IMP FM FOR EXAMPLE

01:35:20.114 --> 01:35:21.749
RESPECTING YOUR ELDERS AND THAT

01:35:21.816 --> 01:35:23.551
IS SOMETHING THAT IS AND THAT

01:35:23.617 --> 01:35:24.885
THE FAMILY UNIT AND HOW

01:35:24.952 --> 01:35:26.320
IMPORTANT THAT IS BUT THEN WE

01:35:26.387 --> 01:35:28.155
START UNPACK SOME OF THE THINGS

01:35:28.222 --> 01:35:29.590
THAT ARE NOT HEALTHY ABOUT IT.

01:35:29.657 --> 01:35:31.725
SO WE TALK ABOUT GENDER NORMS

01:35:31.792 --> 01:35:34.161
AND WHEN YOU TRY TO PUT THE MAN

01:35:34.228 --> 01:35:36.931
FIRST HOW THAT IS SOME OF THE

01:35:36.997 --> 01:35:38.165
THE REASONS WHY DOMESTIC

01:35:38.232 --> 01:35:40.267
VIOLENCE OCCURS IS BECAUSE THIS

01:35:40.334 --> 01:35:41.635
THIS POWER IMBALANCE AND THE

01:35:41.702 --> 01:35:43.771
IMPORTANCE OF RESPECTING ONE MAN.

01:35:43.838 --> 01:35:45.806
IN THE SAME WAY THAT YOU RESPECT

01:35:45.873 --> 01:35:48.442
MAN AND SO IT IS.

01:35:48.509 --> 01:35:50.377
IT IS CHALLENGING BECAUSE

01:35:50.444 --> 01:35:51.946
SOMETIMES PEOPLE FEEL THAT.

01:35:52.012 --> 01:35:53.848
THAT RESPECTING THE MAN IS

01:35:53.914 --> 01:36:01.355
ROOTED IN OUR CREAM CULTURE AND

01:36:01.422 --> 01:36:02.857
SO WE TRY TO TEACH THAT NO --

01:36:02.923 --> 01:36:03.557
CREAM CULTURES.

01:36:03.624 --> 01:36:06.327
NECESSARILY A BALLOT FEES ON

01:36:06.393 --> 01:36:07.027
HEALTHY GENDER.

01:36:07.094 --> 01:36:08.562
NORMS IN DYNAMICS BUT IT IS

01:36:08.629 --> 01:36:09.530
LET'S PROMOTE SOME OF THE

01:36:09.597 --> 01:36:10.531
HEALTHIER PARTS OF OF THAT OUT

01:36:10.598 --> 01:36:11.665
OF THAT WE LIKE ABOUT THE

01:36:11.732 --> 01:36:13.367
COMMUNITY AND NOT OTHERS.

01:36:13.434 --> 01:36:14.001
THERE USED O BE A KOREAN SAYING

01:36:14.068 --> 01:36:15.402
BACK IN THE DAY AND IT WENT

01:36:15.469 --> 01:36:17.972
SOMETHING LIKE -- YOU TREAT EACH

01:36:18.038 --> 01:36:20.374
YEAR WOMEN AND THERE'S A DRIED

01:36:20.441 --> 01:36:22.042
FISH THAT KOREANS EAT IN THE

01:36:22.109 --> 01:36:23.477
SAME WAY THEY SHOULD BE BEATEN

01:36:23.544 --> 01:36:25.179
EVERY THREE DAYS BECAUSE THIS

01:36:25.246 --> 01:36:26.614
FISH NEEDS TO BE POUNDED IN

01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:28.649
ORDER TO BE SOFT ENOUGH TO EAT.

01:36:28.716 --> 01:36:30.384
AS WE TALK ABOUT HOW THAT USED

01:36:30.451 --> 01:36:32.786
TO BE THE NORM IN OUR CREAM

01:36:32.853 --> 01:36:35.556
COMMUNITY BACK WELL MANY MANY

01:36:35.623 --> 01:36:36.757
DECADES AGO BUT WE SAY HOW

01:36:36.824 --> 01:36:38.759
FOOLISH AND HOW WRONG THAT IS

01:36:38.826 --> 01:36:40.060
NOW AND PEOPLE.

01:36:40.127 --> 01:36:42.129
CAN AGREE WITH THAT THAT WE HAVE

01:36:42.196 --> 01:36:43.464
EVOLVED FROM THAT SO IT'S

01:36:43.531 --> 01:36:45.099
CONTINUING TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE

01:36:45.166 --> 01:36:46.433
NEED TO EVOLVE OUR CULTURE AND

01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:47.768
THAT IF WE WANT TO ADDRESS

01:36:47.835 --> 01:36:48.736
THINGS LIKE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:36:48.802 --> 01:36:50.571
AND SOCIAL SEXUAL ASSAULT.

01:36:50.638 --> 01:36:51.972
WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE

01:36:52.039 --> 01:36:53.941
PATRIARCHAL GENDER NORMS AND I

01:36:54.008 --> 01:36:55.509
THINK PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO SEE

01:36:55.576 --> 01:36:56.977
THAT WHEN THEY SEE WHAT.

01:36:57.044 --> 01:36:58.879
WHAT THE IMPACT HOUSE ON THE

01:36:58.946 --> 01:37:00.181
FAMILY?

01:37:00.247 --> 01:37:02.816
AND IF I'M AT MY MAY RESPOND TO

01:37:02.883 --> 01:37:03.817
SOME OF THE OTHER COMMENTS --

01:37:03.884 --> 01:37:05.219
BUT YOU KNOW I DO APPRECIATE YOU

01:37:05.286 --> 01:37:07.154
SHARING WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT WHAT

01:37:07.221 --> 01:37:08.489
YOUR FAITH LEADER HAS SAID TO

01:37:08.556 --> 01:37:09.790
YOU AS A CHILD AND WE'VE HEARD

01:37:09.857 --> 01:37:11.192
COUNTLESS STORIES FROM OUR

01:37:11.258 --> 01:37:12.359
SURVIVORS.

01:37:12.426 --> 01:37:13.661
SOME LIKE THAT THAT ARE REALLY

01:37:13.727 --> 01:37:15.029
DEVASTATING AND OTHERS WHERE

01:37:15.095 --> 01:37:17.965
THEY'VE BEEN REALLY SUPPORTIVE --

01:37:18.032 --> 01:37:19.934
TO THE THE SURVIVOR AND HER

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:20.601
CHILDREN.

01:37:20.668 --> 01:37:22.002
AND IT MAKES A NIGHT AND DAY

01:37:22.069 --> 01:37:23.671
DIFFERENCE THE WAY YOUR FACE

01:37:23.737 --> 01:37:25.773
LEADER RESPONDS YOU KNOW PEOPLE

01:37:25.839 --> 01:37:27.508
HAVE LOST THEIR FAITH IN GOD IF

01:37:27.575 --> 01:37:29.243
THEY HAVE NOT BEEN TREATED AND

01:37:29.310 --> 01:37:30.811
SUPPORTED DURING THEIR MOMENTS

01:37:30.878 --> 01:37:31.879
OF CRISIS.

01:37:31.946 --> 01:37:33.514
AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN REINFORCED

01:37:33.581 --> 01:37:35.649
IN THEIR FAITH -- BECAUSE OF

01:37:35.716 --> 01:37:37.184
WHAT'S HAPPENED AND GONE ON TO

01:37:37.251 --> 01:37:39.553
HELP OTHERS AND SO WE DO SEE IT

01:37:39.620 --> 01:37:40.988
SO POWERFUL WHEN THE FAITH

01:37:41.055 --> 01:37:42.723
LEADERS CAN HAVE SO MUCH

01:37:42.790 --> 01:37:43.691
INFLUENCE.

01:37:43.757 --> 01:37:44.758
IN IN IN CREATING A BETTER

01:37:44.825 --> 01:37:47.595

THINGS THAT COULD BE DIFFERENT

01:42:54.768 --> 01:42:55.903
THAT WOULD FACILITATE.

01:42:55.969 --> 01:42:58.071
A MORE EFFECTIVE WAY TO SERVE

01:42:58.138 --> 01:42:59.606
OUR LGBT COMMUNITY WHO COME IN

BINARY WHEN IT COMES TO WOMEN

01:43:10.183 --> 01:43:12.219
ARE ARE VICTIMS MANNER ARE

01:43:12.286 --> 01:43:13.954
USUALLY THE BATTERS AND WHEN IT

01:43:14.021 --> 01:43:15.589
COMES TO THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY

01:43:15.656 --> 01:43:17.424
IT'S MORE COMPLEX.

01:43:17.491 --> 01:43:18.692
RIGHT BECAUSE THERE'S DIFFERENT

01:43:18.759 --> 01:43:21.061
TYPES OF IDENTITIES -- SEX

01:43:21.128 --> 01:43:22.529
ORIENTATION AND GENDER IDENTITY

01:43:22.596 --> 01:43:24.364
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE TEND TO TO

01:43:24.431 --> 01:43:25.599
GET CONFUSED WHEN IT COMES TO

01:43:25.666 --> 01:43:27.367
THIS RIGHT YOU KNOW LET'S SAY

RIGHT AND THERE'S SOMETHING THAT

01:43:31.371 --> 01:43:33.440
HAPPENS ONE IS MORE MASCULINE

01:43:33.507 --> 01:43:34.174
PRESENTING WITH MORE FEMALE

01:43:34.241 --> 01:43:36.376
PRESENTING SOMETIMES WHEN WHEN --

01:43:36.443 --> 01:43:37.210
LAW ENFORCEMENT GETS INVOLVED

01:43:37.277 --> 01:43:39.112
THEY AUTOMATICALLY ASSUME THAT

01:43:39.179 --> 01:43:40.948
THE MORE MASCULINE PRESENTING --

01:43:41.014 --> 01:43:42.683
WOMAN IS THE AGGRESSOR JUST

01:43:42.749 --> 01:43:44.885
BECAUSE OF OUR OUR GENDER NORMS

01:43:44.952 --> 01:43:46.787
SO DEFINITELY THINKING OUTSIDE

01:43:46.853 --> 01:43:50.357

01:46:04.024 --> 01:46:07.761
AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

01:46:07.828 --> 01:46:08.595
OF STAND STRONG.

01:46:08.662 --> 01:46:10.831
A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ORGANIZATION

01:46:10.897 --> 01:46:12.299
IN SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY.

01:46:12.365 --> 01:46:14.501
I AM NEWISH TO CALIFORNIA I

01:46:14.568 --> 01:46:15.802
MOVED HERE ABOUT TWO AND A HALF

01:46:15.869 --> 01:46:18.071
YEARS AGO FROM ATLANTA GEORGIA.

01:46:18.138 --> 01:46:20.140
SO THIS IS MY FIRST TIME IN YOUR

01:46:20.207 --> 01:46:21.475
CAPITOL BUILDING AND IT'S

01:46:21.541 --> 01:46:22.909
BEAUTIFUL THANK YOU.

01:46:22.976 --> 01:46:24.344
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME AND FOR

01:46:24.411 --> 01:46:26.079
HOLDING THIS HEARING AND THANK

01:46:26.146 --> 01:46:27.614
YOU ESPECIALLY TO YOU.

01:46:27.681 --> 01:46:28.882
ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO FOR

01:46:28.949 --> 01:46:31.251
SHARING THIS COMMITTEE AND FOR

01:46:31.318 --> 01:46:33.253
GIVING VOICE TO THIS ISSUE.

01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:35.455
IN ATLANTA I WORKED AT THE US

01:46:35.522 --> 01:46:36.957
CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND

01:46:37.023 --> 01:46:38.492
PREVENTION THE CDC.

01:46:38.558 --> 01:46:40.427
WHICH AS YOU KNOW IS THE

01:46:40.494 --> 01:46:41.795
NATION'S PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCY.

01:46:41.862 --> 01:46:43.330
MANY PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT IN

01:46:43.396 --> 01:46:44.831
ADDITION TO ADDRESSING THINGS

01:46:44.898 --> 01:46:46.466
LIKE FLU AND EBOLA.

01:46:46.533 --> 01:46:48.201
THE CDC ALSO HAS A DIVISION OF

01:46:48.268 --> 01:46:49.736
VIOLENCE PREVENTION.

01:46:49.803 --> 01:46:51.304
AND THAT IS BECAUSE VIOLENCE IS

01:46:51.371 --> 01:46:52.873
A LEADING CAUSE OF INJURY AND

01:46:52.939 --> 01:46:55.175
DEATH IN THIS COUNTRY.

01:46:55.242 --> 01:46:57.377
SO FOR THAT REASON IT REQUIRES A

01:46:57.444 --> 01:46:58.912
PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH AND THE

01:46:58.979 --> 01:47:00.280
GOAL IS TO TRULY PREVENT THE

01:47:00.347 --> 01:47:02.482
VIOLENCE. TO STOP IT BEFORE IT

01:47:02.549 --> 01:47:03.884
EVEN STARTS.

01:47:03.950 --> 01:47:04.985
IN THE DIVISION OF VIOLENCE

01:47:05.051 --> 01:47:06.620
PREVENTION I LED THE CDC'S

01:47:06.686 --> 01:47:08.388
NATIONAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:47:08.455 --> 01:47:10.157
PREVENTION PROGRAM.

01:47:10.223 --> 01:47:11.758
IN THAT ROLE I GOT TO SEE WHAT

01:47:11.825 --> 01:47:12.959
VIOLENCE PREVENTION LOOKS LIKE

01:47:13.026 --> 01:47:14.795
IN STATES AND COMMUNITIES ACROSS

01:47:14.861 --> 01:47:16.196
THE COUNTRY.

01:47:16.263 --> 01:47:17.430
AND I LEARNED A LOT OF THINGS

01:47:17.497 --> 01:47:18.832
THERE THAT HAVE CARRIED THROUGH

01:47:18.899 --> 01:47:20.367
IN MY ROLE IT STANDS STRONG HERE

01:47:20.433 --> 01:47:24.271
IN CALIFORNIA. FOR ONE THING I

01:47:24.337 --> 01:47:26.139
LEARNED MORE ABOUT A PROGRAM

01:47:26.206 --> 01:47:27.774
CALLED COACHING BOYS INTO MEN.

01:47:27.841 --> 01:47:29.209
WE ARE VERY FORTUNATE TO BE

01:47:29.276 --> 01:47:31.044
IMPLEMENTING THIS PROGRAM IN SAN

01:47:31.111 --> 01:47:32.612
LUIS OBISPO COUNTY.

01:47:32.679 --> 01:47:34.114
THIS IS A PROGRAM WORKING WITH

01:47:34.181 --> 01:47:36.750
HIGH SCHOOL AGE MALE ATHLETES

01:47:36.817 --> 01:47:38.218
BUILDING ON THEIR STRENGTHS AS

01:47:38.285 --> 01:47:39.853
LEADERS AND INFLUENCERS IN THEIR

01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:41.788
PEER GROUPS. TO CHANGE THE

01:47:41.855 --> 01:47:44.257
CULTURE ON THAT TEAM IN THAT

01:47:44.324 --> 01:47:45.992
SCHOOL IN THEIR PEER GROUP.

01:47:46.059 --> 01:47:47.694
IN THEIR COMMUNITY.

01:47:47.761 --> 01:47:48.628
THE CHARACTERISTICS THAT

01:47:48.695 --> 01:47:51.031
ATHLETES OFTEN LEARN ON THE

01:47:51.097 --> 01:47:52.232
FIELD OR ON HE COURT.

01:47:52.299 --> 01:47:54.100
SUCH AS LEADERSHIP RESPECT AND

01:47:54.167 --> 01:47:55.502
COOPERATION.

01:47:55.569 --> 01:47:57.971
CAN ALSO TRANSLATE INTO SKILLS

01:47:58.038 --> 01:47:58.438
FOR PROMOTING HEALTHY

01:47:58.505 --> 01:48:00.807
RELATIONSHIPS WHETHER IT'S WITH

01:48:00.874 --> 01:48:02.142
YOU KNOW OTHERS IN THEIR LIFE

01:48:02.209 --> 01:48:04.277
PARENTS PEERS AND CURRENT OR

01:48:04.344 --> 01:48:06.313
FUTURE ROMANTIC PARTNERS AS YOU.

01:48:06.379 --> 01:48:08.615
DISCUSS IT'S NOT ALWAYS THAT

01:48:08.682 --> 01:48:09.149
ROMANTIC PARTNER COULD BE

01:48:09.216 --> 01:48:10.250
FRIENDS.

01:48:10.317 --> 01:48:11.618
SINCE COACHING BOYS INTO MEN

01:48:11.685 --> 01:48:13.186
BEGAN IN TWO THOUSAND ONE

01:48:13.253 --> 01:48:14.688
THOUSANDS OF COACHES AROUND THE

01:48:14.754 --> 01:48:16.623
WORLD HAVE SIGNED ON AND WHAT'S

01:48:16.690 --> 01:48:17.924
EVEN MORE EXCITING.

01:48:17.991 --> 01:48:19.359
IS THAT THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN

01:48:19.426 --> 01:48:21.895
RIGOROUSLY TESTED AND EVALUATED.

01:48:21.962 --> 01:48:23.697
AND THE RESULTS ARE SOME VERY

01:48:23.763 --> 01:48:25.232
ENCOURAGING OUTCOMES.

01:48:25.298 --> 01:48:26.933
IN THIS STUDY THAT INCLUDED

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:28.468
SIXTEEN HIGH SCHOOLS AND OVER

01:48:28.535 --> 01:48:29.769
TWO THOUSAND ATHLETES THE

01:48:29.836 --> 01:48:31.471
RESULTS SHOW THAT ATHLETES WHO

01:48:31.538 --> 01:48:33.340
PARTICIPATED IN THE PROGRAM NOT

01:48:33.406 --> 01:48:35.208
ONLY HAD GREATER INTENTIONS TO

01:48:35.275 --> 01:48:36.443
INTERVENE.

01:48:36.509 --> 01:48:37.577
WHEN THEY SAW ABUSIVE AND

01:48:37.644 --> 01:48:39.079
DISRESPECTFUL BEHAVIOR AMONG

01:48:39.145 --> 01:48:40.780
THEIR PEERS BUT THEY ACTUALLY

01:48:40.847 --> 01:48:42.816
DID SPEAK UP AND INTERVENE IN

01:48:42.883 --> 01:48:45.018
THESE SITUATIONS AT HIGHER RATES?

01:48:45.085 --> 01:48:46.319
THAN THOSE WHO HAD NOT BEEN

01:48:46.386 --> 01:48:47.888
THROUGH THE PROGRAM.

01:48:47.954 --> 01:48:50.023
NOT ONLY THAT BUT EVEN A YEAR

01:48:50.090 --> 01:48:51.591
AFTER COMPLETING THE PROGRAM.

01:48:51.658 --> 01:48:52.959
THOSE WHO HAD PARTICIPATED IN

01:48:53.026 --> 01:48:55.528
THE PROGRAM HAD LOWER RATES OF

01:48:55.595 --> 01:48:56.897
ABUSE PERPETRATION.

01:48:56.963 --> 01:48:59.099
AND LOWER RATES OF PASSIVELY

01:48:59.165 --> 01:49:00.800
ALLOWING ABUSED TO HAPPEN AMONG

01:49:00.867 --> 01:49:02.402
THEIR PEERS.

01:49:02.469 --> 01:49:04.671
SO THIS RESEARCH TELLS US THAT

01:49:04.738 --> 01:49:07.073
YES IT REALLY IS POSSIBLE. TO

01:49:07.140 --> 01:49:08.675
STOP GENDER BASED VIOLENCE

01:49:08.742 --> 01:49:10.877
BEFORE IT STARTS AND THAT YES WE

01:49:10.944 --> 01:49:13.680
ARE ON THE RIGHT TRACK.

01:49:13.747 --> 01:49:15.415
IN SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY WE'RE

01:49:15.482 --> 01:49:16.883
IMPLEMENTING THIS PROGRAM INTO

01:49:16.950 --> 01:49:18.985
HIGH SCHOOL SO FAR. ONE CATHOLIC

01:49:19.052 --> 01:49:19.586
HIGH SCHOOL IN ONE PUBLIC HIGH

01:49:19.653 --> 01:49:21.321
SCHOOL.

01:49:21.388 --> 01:49:22.956
AT ONE OF THE SCHOOLS WE ARE

01:49:23.023 --> 01:49:24.457
WORKING WITH A VOLLEY BALL A

01:49:24.524 --> 01:49:26.359
GOLF AND THE BASEBALL TEAM RIGHT

01:49:26.426 --> 01:49:27.794
NOW.

01:49:27.861 --> 01:49:28.428
AND WE'RE ADDING FOOTBALL IN THE

01:49:28.495 --> 01:49:29.930
FALL.

01:49:29.996 --> 01:49:31.498
ALTHOUGH IT'S EARLY ON WE'RE

01:49:31.564 --> 01:49:32.933
ALREADY SEEING SOME ANECDOTAL

01:49:32.999 --> 01:49:34.901
EVIDENCE OF THE IMPACT THAT THIS

01:49:34.968 --> 01:49:36.703
PROGRAM IS HAVING.

01:49:36.770 --> 01:49:38.071
COACHES HAVE SHARED THAT THEY'VE

01:49:38.138 --> 01:49:39.339
NOTICED DIFFERENCES IN THEIR

01:49:39.406 --> 01:49:41.408
TEAMS MOSTLY IN THE LANGUAGE

01:49:41.474 --> 01:49:43.109
THAT THEY USE.

01:49:43.176 --> 01:49:44.244
AND HOW THEY HOLD EACH OTHER

01:49:44.311 --> 01:49:45.545
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS

01:49:45.612 --> 01:49:48.014
AND FOR THEIR WORDS.

01:49:48.081 --> 01:49:48.982
THEY'VE ALSO NOTICED THIS

01:49:49.049 --> 01:49:51.284
PROGRAM BRINGING TEAMS TOGETHER

01:49:51.351 --> 01:49:52.619
AND GETTING THEM TO COMMUNICATE

01:49:52.686 --> 01:49:55.522
ON A DEEPER LEVEL. ONE COACH

01:49:55.588 --> 01:49:57.023
SHARE THAT AFTER DISCUSSING

01:49:57.090 --> 01:49:59.125
HARMFUL LANGUAGE DURING ONE OF

01:49:59.192 --> 01:50:00.260
THEIR COACHING BOYS INTO MEN

01:50:00.327 --> 01:50:02.395
SESSIONS ONE STUDENT ACTUALLY

01:50:02.462 --> 01:50:04.464
CALLED ANOTHER ONE OUT.

01:50:04.531 --> 01:50:05.065
WHEN HE STARTED MAKING FUN OF

01:50:05.131 --> 01:50:06.700
HIS TEAMMATES?

01:50:06.766 --> 01:50:07.934
ANOTHER COACH HAS SEEN OLDER

01:50:08.001 --> 01:50:09.602
PLAYERS RISE TO LEADERSHIP ROLES

01:50:09.669 --> 01:50:11.638
IN THE PROGRAM SOMETIMES LEADING

01:50:11.705 --> 01:50:13.006
DISCUSSIONS ON THESE TOPICS

01:50:13.073 --> 01:50:14.341
SOMETIMES FOR OVER THIRTY

01:50:14.407 --> 01:50:15.742
MINUTES.

01:50:15.809 --> 01:50:16.910
HE SAID IT'S OBVIOUS THAT THE

01:50:16.977 --> 01:50:18.578
ATHLETES WANT TO TALK ABOUT

01:50:18.645 --> 01:50:19.813
THESE TOPICS.

01:50:19.879 --> 01:50:21.348
BUT MANY OF THEM HAVE NEVER BEEN

01:50:21.414 --> 01:50:22.782
GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY OR THE

01:50:22.849 --> 01:50:25.018
TOOLS TO COMMUNICATE THEIR

01:50:25.085 --> 01:50:25.852
THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS TO ONE

01:50:25.919 --> 01:50:26.920
ANOTHER.

01:50:26.987 --> 01:50:29.389
PRIOR TO THIS PROGRAM.

01:50:29.456 --> 01:50:30.857
ANOTHER COACH SHARE THAT WHEN HE

01:50:30.924 --> 01:50:32.659
OVER HEARD A DISRESPECTFUL

01:50:32.726 --> 01:50:34.361
DISCUSSION IN THE LOCKER ROOM HE

01:50:34.427 --> 01:50:35.495
WAS PROUD TO HEAR ANOTHER

01:50:35.562 --> 01:50:37.330
STUDENT CHIME IN TO SAY THAT HEY

01:50:37.397 --> 01:50:40.834
WE SHOULD BE SAYING THAT STUFF.

01:50:40.900 --> 01:50:42.135
NOW WHENEVER I TELL PEOPLE ABOUT

01:50:42.202 --> 01:50:43.536
COACHING BOYS INTO MEN THEY

01:50:43.603 --> 01:50:45.005
ALWAYS SAY THAT'S AWESOME FOR

01:50:45.071 --> 01:50:46.306
THE BOYS.

01:50:46.373 --> 01:50:48.641
WHAT ABOUT THE GIRLS?

01:50:48.708 --> 01:50:49.709
IT WAS REALLY HARD TO FIND

01:50:49.776 --> 01:50:51.044
FUNDING TO DO SOMETHING SIMILAR

01:50:51.111 --> 01:50:52.178
WITH GIRLS.

01:50:52.245 --> 01:50:53.913
WE HAD A LOT OF GOOD IDEAS AND

01:50:53.980 --> 01:50:55.415
PLANS AND WE HAD THE PERFECT

01:50:55.482 --> 01:50:56.583
INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:50:56.649 --> 01:50:58.618
BECAUSE WE WERE ALREADY SET UP

01:50:58.685 --> 01:51:00.220
TO DO THE SAME WORK WITH BOYS

01:51:00.286 --> 01:51:02.155
THEIR COACHING BOYS INTO MEN.

01:51:02.222 --> 01:51:03.423
BUT WE WERE NOT ABLE TO

01:51:03.490 --> 01:51:04.924
IMPLEMENTED BECAUSE THERE SIMPLY

01:51:04.991 --> 01:51:06.326
IS NOT A LOT OF FUNDING OUT

01:51:06.393 --> 01:51:08.628
THERE FOR PREVENTION.

01:51:08.695 --> 01:51:10.063
PREVENTION CAN BE HARDER TO

01:51:10.130 --> 01:51:12.532
UNDERSTANDING GRAB HOLD OF THEM

01:51:12.599 --> 01:51:14.100
WHAT FOLKS ARE USED TO FUNDING.

01:51:14.167 --> 01:51:15.468
WHICH IS HOW TO INTERVENE AFTER

01:51:15.535 --> 01:51:18.238
THE DAMAGE HAS BEEN DONE.

01:51:18.304 --> 01:51:20.173
AS A SOCIETY WERE OFTEN MUCH

01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:21.441
BETTER AT HELPING OUT AFTER THE

01:51:21.508 --> 01:51:23.610
FACT.

01:51:23.676 --> 01:51:25.345
WHAT SAVE THE DAY FOR US FINALLY

01:51:25.412 --> 01:51:26.713
WAS THE FAMILY VIOLENCE

01:51:26.780 --> 01:51:28.114
PREVENTION GRANT FOR THE FX

01:51:28.181 --> 01:51:30.216
GRANT FROM CALLOW YES THE

01:51:30.283 --> 01:51:31.785
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY

01:51:31.851 --> 01:51:33.286
SERVICES?

01:51:33.353 --> 01:51:34.854
I'M EXTREMELY HAPPY TO TELL YOU

01:51:34.921 --> 01:51:36.256
THAT WE ARE NOW ABLE TO

01:51:36.322 --> 01:51:37.824
IMPLEMENT A PROGRAM FOR HIGH

01:51:37.891 --> 01:51:39.392
SCHOOL AGE GIRLS.

01:51:39.459 --> 01:51:40.994
CALL ATHLETES AS LEADERS.

01:51:41.061 --> 01:51:42.495
THAT WAS DESIGNED AS THE

01:51:42.562 --> 01:51:43.863
COMPANION PROGRAM TO COACHING

01:51:43.930 --> 01:51:46.066
BOYS INTO MEN.

01:51:46.132 --> 01:51:47.500
AND EVEN THOUGH THAT GRANT JUST

01:51:47.567 --> 01:51:48.802
STARTED WE ALREADY HAVE A GIRLS

01:51:48.868 --> 01:51:50.270
VOLLEYBALL TEAM AND A ROLLER

01:51:50.336 --> 01:51:51.371
DERBY TEAM.

01:51:51.438 --> 01:51:53.073
ON BOARD TO IMPLEMENT THE

01:51:53.139 --> 01:51:55.308
ATHLETES AS LEADERS PROGRAM.

01:51:55.375 --> 01:51:56.776
WE'RE EXTREMELY GRATEFUL FOR

01:51:56.843 --> 01:51:57.610
THIS FUNDING AND FOR THE

01:51:57.677 --> 01:51:59.245
FORESIGHT AND A COMMITMENT FROM

01:51:59.312 --> 01:52:00.947
THE LEGISLATURE THAT HAS MADE

01:52:01.014 --> 01:52:02.715
THIS POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE SIMPLY

01:52:02.782 --> 01:52:05.118
COULD NOT DO THIS WORK WITHOUT

01:52:05.185 --> 01:52:07.620
THIS FUNDING FROM CALLOW YES.

01:52:07.687 --> 01:52:09.022
AND THAT'S ANOTHER LESSON THAT I

01:52:09.089 --> 01:52:11.591
LEARNED IN MY TIME AT CDC.

01:52:11.658 --> 01:52:12.859
I LEARNED THAT STATE FUNDING IS

01:52:12.926 --> 01:52:14.928
ESSENTIAL FOR THE SUCCESS OF

01:52:14.994 --> 01:52:16.663
VIOLENCE PREVENTION EFFORTS.

01:52:16.729 --> 01:52:18.331
WITHOUT THESE FUNDS THERE IS

01:52:18.398 --> 01:52:19.666
JUST A VERY LITTLE FINANCIAL

01:52:19.732 --> 01:52:21.668
SUPPORT FOR VIOLENCE PREVENTION

01:52:21.734 --> 01:52:24.204
AND PARTICULARLY FOR SEXUAL AND

01:52:24.270 --> 01:52:26.439
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PREVENTION.

01:52:26.506 --> 01:52:27.807
EVEN THAT GREAT CDC FUNDING

01:52:27.874 --> 01:52:28.908
WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT A LITTLE

01:52:28.975 --> 01:52:30.510
BIT HERE TODAY WHICH IS

01:52:30.577 --> 01:52:32.178
WONDERFUL.

01:52:32.245 --> 01:52:33.780
IS LESS THAN SIX MILLION DOLLARS

01:52:33.847 --> 01:52:34.914
NATIONWIDE.

01:52:34.981 --> 01:52:37.083
IT ONLY FUNDS TEN STATES.

01:52:37.150 --> 01:52:38.952
AND WE'RE LUCKY THAT

01:52:39.018 --> 01:52:40.186
CALIFORNIA'S ONE OF THEM.

01:52:40.253 --> 01:52:41.621
BUT EACH OF THOSE TEN STATES ARE

01:52:41.688 --> 01:52:43.857
LIMITED TO WORKING WITH THAT

01:52:43.923 --> 01:52:45.892
FUNDING IN ONLY TWO COMMUNITIES.

01:52:45.959 --> 01:52:48.995
SO THAT FUNDING IS A GREAT START.

01:52:49.062 --> 01:52:50.563
BUT IT'S NOT AND REALLY NOT

01:52:50.630 --> 01:52:52.132
INTENDED TO BE.

01:52:52.198 --> 01:52:53.566
ALL ENCOMPASSING AND I'M

01:52:53.633 --> 01:52:55.502
ACTUALLY HAPPY TO ANSWER MORE

01:52:55.568 --> 01:52:56.102
QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT LATER IF

01:52:56.169 --> 01:52:58.571
YOU LIKE -- BUT YOU KNOW OFTEN

01:52:58.638 --> 01:52:59.873
IT'S EASIER FOR FUNDERS TO

01:52:59.939 --> 01:53:02.308
UNDERSTAND.

01:53:02.375 --> 01:53:03.676
PAYING FOR NIGHTS AT THE SHELTER

01:53:03.743 --> 01:53:05.011
FOR CHILD CARE YOU KNOW THOSE

01:53:05.078 --> 01:53:07.447
THINGS THAT FEEL MORE IMMEDIATE

01:53:07.514 --> 01:53:09.215
AND FEEL MORE TANGIBLE.

01:53:09.282 --> 01:53:10.517
AND I REALLY UNDERSTAND

01:53:10.583 --> 01:53:12.118
PERSONALLY WHY IT FEELS GOOD TO

01:53:12.185 --> 01:53:13.720
FUND THOSE THINGS AND THOSE

01:53:13.786 --> 01:53:17.157
THINGS ARE ABSOLUTELY VITAL --

01:53:17.223 --> 01:53:19.826
BUT AS WE LOOK DOWN THE ROAD.

01:53:19.893 --> 01:53:21.294
IF WE WANT TO REACH A DAY WHERE

01:53:21.361 --> 01:53:22.595
WE NO LONGER HAVE TO FIND

01:53:22.662 --> 01:53:25.098
SHELTERS. TO A FUTURE WHERE NO

01:53:25.165 --> 01:53:26.299
ONE HAS TO LEAVE HOME BECAUSE

01:53:26.366 --> 01:53:28.268
THEY'RE BEING TERRORIZED BY

01:53:28.334 --> 01:53:30.470
SOMEONE WHO CLAIMS TO LOVE THEM.

01:53:30.537 --> 01:53:31.738
WE HAVE TO INVEST NOW IN

01:53:31.804 --> 01:53:34.140
PREVENTION.

01:53:34.207 --> 01:53:35.708
FUNDING PREVENTION IS A SMART

01:53:35.775 --> 01:53:38.478
LONG TERM INVESTMENT AND IT IS

01:53:38.545 --> 01:53:40.113
AN INVESTMENT IN OUR CHILDREN.

01:53:40.180 --> 01:53:41.114
IN OUR COMMUNITIES.

01:53:41.181 --> 01:53:42.348
AND IN OUR FUTURE [inaudible]

01:53:42.415 --> 01:53:44.684
THANK YOU.

01:53:44.751 --> 01:53:46.920

MORE AND I THINK WE WE KNOW THAT.

01:53:56.095 --> 01:53:57.897
PREVENTION IS ALWAYS BETTER THAN

01:53:57.964 --> 01:54:00.066
CARE YET YOUR TIME AND AGAIN IN

01:54:00.133 --> 01:54:01.534
ISSUE AFTER ISSUE WE DON'T

01:54:01.601 --> 01:54:03.403
INVEST IN PREVENTION WE WAIT FOR

01:54:03.469 --> 01:54:07.240
THERE TO BE A CRISIS -- SIX

01:54:07.307 --> 01:54:08.308

FUNDING THAT YOU HAVE RIGHT NOW.

01:54:23.990 --> 01:54:25.558
IS SUFFICIENT FOR YOU TO OPERATE

01:54:25.625 --> 01:54:27.060
IN TO COMMUNITIES.

01:54:27.126 --> 01:54:28.528

HIGH SCHOOLS TO THAT.

01:54:34.534 --> 01:54:35.969

LEADERS PROGRAM STARTED MORE

01:54:37.337 --> 01:54:38.538
RECENTLY BECAUSE THAT'S A GRANT

01:54:38.605 --> 01:54:41.307
THAT JUST STARTED FOR US -- AND

01:54:41.374 --> 01:54:42.675
THAT'S THE ONE THROUGH THE THE

01:54:42.742 --> 01:54:44.010
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY

01:54:44.077 --> 01:54:45.778
SERVICES AND THAT'S THE PROGRAM

01:54:45.845 --> 01:54:46.980
FOR THE FEMALE IDENTIFIED

01:54:47.046 --> 01:54:49.782
ATHLETES -- AND THROUGH THAT WE

01:54:49.849 --> 01:54:51.618
HAVE ONE ADDITIONAL HIGH SCHOOL --

VOLLEYBALL AND THEN A NON HIGH

01:54:54.854 --> 01:54:55.355
SCHOOL SETTING WHICH IS THE

01:54:55.421 --> 01:54:56.789
ROLLER DERBY?

01:54:56.856 --> 01:54:58.358
AND HAVE YOU.

01:54:58.424 --> 01:54:59.626
THOUGHT AT ALL ABOUT WHAT IT

01:54:59.692 --> 01:55:01.894
WOULD TAKE.

01:55:01.961 --> 01:55:03.529
TO EXPAND THAT.

01:55:03.596 --> 01:55:05.265
OF COURSE OF COURSE YEAH WE OKAY

01:55:05.331 --> 01:55:07.100
I THINK ABOUT THAT ALL THE TIME --

01:55:07.166 --> 01:55:08.134
WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE

01:55:08.201 --> 01:55:09.636
FUNDING THAT WE HAVE BUT WE ALSO

01:55:09.702 --> 01:55:12.171
KNOW THAT -- IN TERMS OF WHAT

01:55:12.238 --> 01:55:13.840
NEEDS TO BE DONE IT SORT OF JUST

01:55:13.906 --> 01:55:16.309
A DROP IN THE BUCKET -- WITH THE

01:55:16.376 --> 01:55:17.877
WITH THE FEDERAL FUNDING THE CDC

01:55:17.944 --> 01:55:19.946
FUNDING WE DO HOPE TO EXPAND TO

01:55:20.013 --> 01:55:21.281
MORE SCHOOLS HOPING TO

01:55:21.347 --> 01:55:23.149
EVENTUALLY GET. TO FIVE FOR THE

01:55:23.216 --> 01:55:25.585
MALE IDENTIFIED ATHLETES AND

01:55:25.652 --> 01:55:27.253
THAT -- WITH THE ATHLETES AS

01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:29.322
LEADERS I DON'T I DON'T KNOW YET

01:55:29.389 --> 01:55:30.323
WHAT THAT HOLDS BECAUSE IT'S

01:55:30.390 --> 01:55:32.792
STILL A NEWER PROCESS BUT I MEAN

01:55:32.859 --> 01:55:33.893
YOU THINK ABOUT THE NUMBER OF

01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:35.328
SCHOOLS IN ANY GIVEN COMMUNITY.

01:55:35.395 --> 01:55:36.896
AND OF COURSE IT WOULD TAKE A

01:55:36.963 --> 01:55:38.598
LOT MORE TO BE ABLE TO REALLY

01:55:38.665 --> 01:55:40.633
REACH ALL THE SCHOOLS THAT AND

01:55:40.700 --> 01:55:42.735
ONE THING WE KNOW ABOUT

01:55:42.802 --> 01:55:45.972
PREVENTION IS THAT -- YOU HAVE.

01:55:46.039 --> 01:55:47.740
TO REALLY GET IN THERE AND SORT

01:55:47.807 --> 01:55:50.310
OF GO DEEP WE CAN'T SORT OF

01:55:50.376 --> 01:55:51.978
SPRINKLE IT DOWN FROM THE

01:55:52.045 --> 01:55:53.613
DISTRICT LEVEL WE HAVE TO GO

01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:55.415
INTO THE SCHOOLS WE HAVE TO WORK

01:55:55.481 --> 01:55:56.683
WITH THE COACHES WHO THEN.

01:55:56.749 --> 01:56:00.153
WORK WITH THE ATHLETES AND SO --

01:56:00.219 --> 01:56:00.787
UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S NOT A SORT

01:56:00.853 --> 01:56:03.456
OF BROAD.

01:56:03.523 --> 01:56:05.158
TOP DOWN THING THAT WE CAN DO IT

01:56:05.224 --> 01:56:07.093
REALLY IS A MATTER.

01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:09.662
OF GOING INTO EACH SCHOOL.

01:56:09.729 --> 01:56:11.364

THAT CULTURE WITH THE HOPE THAT.

01:56:16.536 --> 01:56:18.971
THE COACHES ARE INFLUENCERS FOR

01:56:19.038 --> 01:56:20.473
THE ATHLETES THE ATHLETES ARE

01:56:20.540 --> 01:56:22.942
INFLUENCERS FOR THEIR PEERS AND

01:56:23.009 --> 01:56:25.178
THAT IT SPREADS THAT WAY.

01:56:25.244 --> 01:56:26.679

WE KNOW THAT CHANGE TAKES TIME

02:00:50.576 --> 02:00:52.078
