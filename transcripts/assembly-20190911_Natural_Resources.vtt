01:08:49.258 --> 01:08:50.326
THE WAY FOR FOLKS TO KNOW THE

01:08:50.392 --> 01:08:52.194
NOTE THAT GOT PASSED TO HIM AND

01:08:52.261 --> 01:08:54.230
WAS AT THE GOVERNOR REFUSE

01:08:54.296 --> 01:08:55.865
RECYCLING COUNCIL JUST GONE ON

01:08:55.931 --> 01:08:58.767
TO NEUTRAL. SO THE GLASS ISSUES

01:08:58.834 --> 01:09:03.405
ARE. A CHALLENGE I THINK THAT

01:09:03.472 --> 01:09:05.107
ON IN THE END OF THE DAY THE

01:09:05.174 --> 01:09:09.111
GLASS HI IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST

01:09:09.178 --> 01:09:09.912
MISTER OF HIS ABSOLUTE RIGHT

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:12.114
IT'S GOT A HIGH RECYCLING RATE

01:09:12.181 --> 01:09:15.184
I IT'S A GOOD PRODUCT FROM ON

01:09:15.251 --> 01:09:16.418
THE MACRO AFFRONT FROM A FROM

01:09:16.485 --> 01:09:18.120
AN ENVIRONMENTAL PERSPECTIVE

01:09:18.187 --> 01:09:21.924
AND THERE'S THERE WITH THE BIG

01:09:21.991 --> 01:09:22.791
FOLKS INVOLVED WITH GLASS

01:09:22.858 --> 01:09:23.826
WORKED WITH US THROUGH THE

01:09:23.893 --> 01:09:25.528
COURSE OF THE YEAR THEY GOT

01:09:25.594 --> 01:09:27.062
THAT WE CREATED A SYSTEM THEIR

01:09:27.129 --> 01:09:28.531
THEIR BIG CONCERN WAS THAT THEY

01:09:28.597 --> 01:09:29.632
WERE GONNA BE DOUBLE CHARGED

01:09:29.698 --> 01:09:30.900
FOR THEIR PARTICIPATION. IN THE

01:09:30.966 --> 01:09:34.069
C. R. V. PROGRAM AND WITHIN SB

01:09:34.136 --> 01:09:36.038
FIFTY FOUR A. B. TEN EIGHTY AND

01:09:36.105 --> 01:09:36.639
AS A RESULT WE STRUCK A DEAL

01:09:36.705 --> 01:09:37.206
WITH THEM WHERE THEY WOULD

01:09:37.273 --> 01:09:40.109
BASICALLY BE IN A FOR THOSE

01:09:40.175 --> 01:09:41.844
FOLKS IN THE GLASS INDUSTRY WHO

01:09:41.911 --> 01:09:43.579
WERE MEETING THEIR TARGETS

01:09:43.646 --> 01:09:45.180
WOULD REMAIN IN SEE EVERY

01:09:45.247 --> 01:09:47.516
PROGRAM AND THEN AT ALL THE WAY

01:09:47.583 --> 01:09:49.285
UP UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY SIX AND

01:09:49.351 --> 01:09:49.852
SO THEY WOULD BASICALLY BE

01:09:49.919 --> 01:09:50.619
EXEMPTED FROM THIS PROGRAM

01:09:50.686 --> 01:09:52.354
UNTIL THEN. AND THAT'S HOW WE

01:09:52.421 --> 01:09:53.856
WERE ABLE TO GET THE BIG

01:09:53.923 --> 01:09:55.090
PLAYERS IN CLASS LIKE THE

01:09:55.157 --> 01:09:57.359
AMERICAN BEVERAGE ASSOCIATION

01:09:57.426 --> 01:09:58.627
AND A LOT OF THE BEER FOLKS IN

01:09:58.694 --> 01:10:00.796
IN OTHER BEVERAGE FOLKS TO MOVE

01:10:00.863 --> 01:10:02.097
INTO A NEUTRAL POSITION THERE

01:10:02.164 --> 01:10:04.099
IS THIS INSTITUTE THE MISTER

01:10:04.166 --> 01:10:06.936
ROPES IN A REPRESENTS. THAT

01:10:07.002 --> 01:10:08.537
CONTINUES TO HAVE CONCERNS I

01:10:08.604 --> 01:10:09.572
CONTINUE TO BELIEVE IN AYE AYE

01:10:09.638 --> 01:10:10.839

THAT WE CAN WE CAN GET THOSE

01:10:13.842 --> 01:10:15.144
ISSUES ADDRESSED BECAUSE IN THE

01:10:15.210 --> 01:10:16.211
END OF THE DAY WE'RE TALKING

01:10:16.278 --> 01:10:17.980
ABOUT AN INDUSTRY HERE THAT

01:10:18.047 --> 01:10:19.515
THERE REALLY DOES MEET THE

01:10:19.582 --> 01:10:22.318
GOALS MUCH HI MUCH MORE THAN A

01:10:22.384 --> 01:10:23.519
LOT OF THE OTHER FOLKS. WHO ARE

01:10:23.586 --> 01:10:24.653

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:25.321
ALWAYS GIVE ME A CERTAIN DEGREE

01:10:25.387 --> 01:10:27.489
OF NERVOUSNESS THERE WAS

01:10:27.556 --> 01:10:28.791
NERVOUSNESS WHEN WE WERE HAVING

01:10:28.857 --> 01:10:29.858
OUR NEGOTIATION WITH THE

01:10:29.925 --> 01:10:30.926
AMERICAN BEVERAGE ASSOCIATION

01:10:30.993 --> 01:10:37.299
BUT I THINK WE MET THEIR. THEIR

01:10:37.366 --> 01:10:37.933
CONCERNS BECAUSE THE END OF THE

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.904

01:10:43.238 --> 01:10:43.706
GET EVERYBODY IN THE GLASS

01:10:43.772 --> 01:10:44.940

01:15:12.608 --> 01:15:14.209
TAKEN CARE OF SO NO MATTER WHAT

01:15:14.276 --> 01:15:15.410
THERE WILL BE. HOLLERS AND

01:15:15.477 --> 01:15:15.878
WASTE MANAGEMENT FOLKS

01:15:15.944 --> 01:15:16.411
INTIMATELY INVOLVED IN THE

01:15:16.478 --> 01:15:17.212
PROCESS THIS DOESN'T CUT OUT

01:15:17.279 --> 01:15:17.813
THE NEED FOR THAT INDUSTRY AT

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:19.147
ALL EFFECTIVE ANYTHING IT IT

01:15:19.214 --> 01:15:20.249
JUST EMPHASIZES THE IMPORTANCE

01:15:20.315 --> 01:15:22.551
OF THAT INDUSTRY HI I THINK

01:15:22.618 --> 01:15:24.052
WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING YOU'RE

01:15:24.119 --> 01:15:25.020
OBVIOUSLY RIGHT ASSEMBLYMEMBER

01:15:25.087 --> 01:15:27.055
THERE'S JUST NERVOUSNESS ARE

01:15:27.122 --> 01:15:29.191
VIEWED THE VERY SPOKE TO BEEN

01:15:29.258 --> 01:15:30.225
INVOLVED WITH THE SPACE OVER

01:15:30.292 --> 01:15:33.896
TIME I. HAVE GOTTEN USED TO THE

01:15:33.962 --> 01:15:37.399
MODEL THAT WE HAVE. AND THEY

01:15:37.466 --> 01:15:38.600
I'M- IN A EVERYBODY KNOWS THE

01:15:38.667 --> 01:15:39.134
MODEL IS ACTUALLY FINALLY

01:15:39.201 --> 01:15:40.535
BROKEN. BUT PEOPLE ARE NERVOUS

01:15:40.602 --> 01:15:41.169
ABOUT ANY CHANGES MIGHT BE MADE

01:15:41.236 --> 01:15:43.538
TO THE MODEL. AND WHERE THEY

01:15:43.605 --> 01:15:47.509
FIT INTO THAT SPACE. AND I

01:15:47.576 --> 01:15:48.143
THINK YOU'RE SEEING I THINK YOU

01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:49.311
SEE I THINK YOU CORRECTLY POINT

01:15:49.378 --> 01:15:51.179
OUT JUST DISPLAY IT BECAUSE IT

01:15:51.246 --> 01:15:52.414
IS BASED ON THAT LEVEL OF

01:15:52.481 --> 01:15:56.385
NERVOUSNESS. I WILL SAY THAT I

01:15:56.451 --> 01:15:58.120
THINK THAT THE FOLKS WHO DO

01:15:58.186 --> 01:15:59.721
CONTINUE TO SUPPORT. THE BILL

01:15:59.788 --> 01:16:02.124
AND IT REALLY IS A SPLIT HERE.

01:16:02.190 --> 01:16:03.458
ARE A WITHIN THE WASTE

01:16:03.525 --> 01:16:04.693
MANAGEMENT BUSINESS

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:05.827
FUNDAMENTALLY RECOGNIZE THAT

01:16:05.894 --> 01:16:08.430
DATE WILL BE. A CRITICAL PART

01:16:08.497 --> 01:16:09.831
OF THE IMPLEMENTATION THIS

01:16:09.898 --> 01:16:11.166
PROGRAM THEY'RE NOT GOING

01:16:11.233 --> 01:16:12.701
ANYWHERE AND THEY WILL BE EVEN

01:16:12.768 --> 01:16:14.002
MORE IMPORTANT AS A RESULT OF

01:16:14.069 --> 01:16:16.071
WHAT WE DO. BECAUSE WE WILL

01:16:16.138 --> 01:16:17.339
HAVE A MORE SOPHISTICATED

01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:18.240
COLLECTION AND RECYCLING

01:16:18.307 --> 01:16:19.574
SYSTEM. AS A RESULT

01:16:19.641 --> 01:16:21.276
IMPLEMENTATIONS PROGRAM AND WE

01:16:21.343 --> 01:16:23.278
HAVE BUILT THEM INTO EVERY

01:16:23.345 --> 01:16:24.746
STAGE OF THE IMPLEMENTATION

01:16:24.813 --> 01:16:26.915
PROCESS THE SCOPING PLAN. THE

01:16:26.982 --> 01:16:27.549
STAKEHOLDER PROCESS THEY WILL

01:16:27.616 --> 01:16:30.018
BE A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF THAT

01:16:30.085 --> 01:16:33.255
CONVERSATION. SO I'M. YOU KNOW

01:16:33.322 --> 01:16:34.423
IN THE END OF THE DAY THAT'S

01:16:34.489 --> 01:16:34.957
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY I CAN

01:16:35.023 --> 01:16:35.557
ANSWER YOUR QUESTION I HAVE A

01:16:35.624 --> 01:16:36.858
SPECIFIC WITH THAT BUT TALK

01:16:36.925 --> 01:16:38.593
MORE ABOUT. THE LONG TERM THAT

01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:40.729
THIS THAT CAL RECYCLE

01:16:40.796 --> 01:16:41.863
REGULATORY SCHEME I'M NOT SURE

01:16:41.930 --> 01:16:45.934
HOW LEDGE COUNCIL. DESCRIBED AS

01:16:46.001 --> 01:16:46.501
IS THAT HOW YOU WOULD JUST

01:16:46.568 --> 01:16:47.369
RATHER THAN A REGIME I SUPPOSE

01:16:47.436 --> 01:16:49.671
YEAH. BUT HOW WILL THAT WORK IN

01:16:49.738 --> 01:16:51.773
PLAIN ENGLISH. YEAH WELL AS FAR

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:54.476
AS IS BILL BECOMES LAW. SO WHAT

01:16:54.543 --> 01:16:55.210
HAPPENS IN THAT YOU'RE NOT

01:16:55.277 --> 01:16:57.012
OVERNIGHT BECAUSE THIS HAPPENED

01:16:57.079 --> 01:16:59.681
HOW IS THAT HOW DOES THIS PLAY

01:16:59.748 --> 01:17:00.415
OUT SO YOU'RE ALL OF BORN IN

01:17:00.482 --> 01:17:03.018
YOUR ON. YOUR ALLUSION TO THE

01:17:03.085 --> 01:17:04.453
GLOBAL WARMING SOLUTION ACT IS

01:17:04.519 --> 01:17:05.387
A GOOD ONE THOUGH I WOULD ONLY

01:17:05.454 --> 01:17:07.522
SAY THAT WE HAVE ON. IT IN THE

01:17:07.589 --> 01:17:09.558
SENSE THAT IT HAS CREATED A

01:17:09.624 --> 01:17:11.526
CREATES STRONG GOALS. AND IT

01:17:11.593 --> 01:17:13.328
SAYS FOLKS WE ALL GOT TO GET

01:17:13.395 --> 01:17:14.596
TOGETHER AND MEET THESE GOALS

01:17:14.663 --> 01:17:16.531
THESE GOALS ARE GOALS THAT ARE

01:17:16.598 --> 01:17:17.532
SET BY THE LEGISLATURE WE WANT

01:17:17.599 --> 01:17:18.467
YOU TO MEET THEM IF THEY'RE

01:17:18.533 --> 01:17:20.202
IMPOSSIBLE TO. MEET THERE WILL

01:17:20.268 --> 01:17:21.870
BE OFFENSE AND FLEXIBILITY BUT

01:17:21.937 --> 01:17:24.773
WE NEED TO SEND A CLEAR MARKET

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:27.909
SIGNALS. TO AT TI INDUSTRY AND

01:17:27.976 --> 01:17:29.644
THE ENTIRE MARKET THAT.

01:17:29.711 --> 01:17:31.246
CALIFORNIA IS SERIOUS ABOUT

01:17:31.313 --> 01:17:31.713
ADDRESSING THIS WASTE

01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:33.448
MANAGEMENT PROBLEM AND WE'RE

01:17:33.515 --> 01:17:35.117
GONNA WE'RE GONNA. CHART A PATH

01:17:35.183 --> 01:17:37.185
TO GET THERE. AND THEN BUT THE

01:17:37.252 --> 01:17:38.420
BIG DIFFERENCE I SUPPOSE

01:17:38.487 --> 01:17:41.123
BETWEEN. THE GLOBAL SOLUTIONS

01:17:41.189 --> 01:17:42.591
MAN YOU KNOW GLOBAL WARMING

01:17:42.657 --> 01:17:45.127
SOLUTIONS ACT. IS THAT THERE'S

01:17:45.193 --> 01:17:46.228
A MORE ROBUST STAKEHOLDER

01:17:46.294 --> 01:17:47.295
PROCESS BUILT IN WE HEARD

01:17:47.362 --> 01:17:49.464
CONCERNS FROM FOLKS ABOUT. THE

01:17:49.531 --> 01:17:50.365
EXTENT TO WHICH CAR WAS

01:17:50.432 --> 01:17:52.034
PERCEIVED AS AND RESPONSIVE

01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:53.468
AND- YOU KNOW DISENGAGED AND AN

01:17:53.535 --> 01:17:55.437
IMPERIOUS AND WE'VE BUILT IN A

01:17:55.504 --> 01:17:57.139
MUCH MORE ROBUST PROCESS FOR

01:17:57.205 --> 01:17:58.774
EVERYBODY TO REALLY BE ENGAGED

01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:00.909
IN. CREATING THE SCOPING PLAN.

01:18:00.976 --> 01:18:02.110
AND I THINK THAT'S WHY WE'VE

01:18:02.177 --> 01:18:03.245
BEEN ABLE TO BUILD IS THE KIND

01:18:03.311 --> 01:18:04.846
OF SUPPORT THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE

01:18:04.913 --> 01:18:05.480
TO BUILD BUT IN THE END OF THE

01:18:05.547 --> 01:18:08.150
DAY. THE SAME. KIND OF MODEL IS

01:18:08.216 --> 01:18:09.484
THERE WHICH IS THAT WE SET

01:18:09.551 --> 01:18:11.119
STRONG GOALS WE CAN WIN POWER

01:18:11.186 --> 01:18:12.587
OUR GOVERNMENT TO HELP US GET

01:18:12.654 --> 01:18:16.258
TO THOSE GOALS. AND WE MAKE IT

01:18:16.324 --> 01:18:17.926
WE DRAW A LINE IN THE SAND

01:18:17.993 --> 01:18:18.894
ABOUT OUR SERIOUSNESS ABOUT

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:20.929
REACHING THOSE GOALS. BUT WE

01:18:20.996 --> 01:18:23.365
BUILDING ENOUGH FLEXIBILITY TO.

01:18:23.432 --> 01:18:24.399
I TO ALLOW US TO CHANGING

01:18:24.466 --> 01:18:29.604
MANEUVER AND ADAPT TO THE

01:18:29.671 --> 01:18:36.078
CHANGING TECHNOLOGY AS. WELL

01:18:36.144 --> 01:18:36.711
AND ONE OF THE THINGS I DID NOT

01:18:36.778 --> 01:18:42.217
WANT TO DO. A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY.

01:18:42.284 --> 01:18:42.818
LAST TO THIS ABOUT HOW WE GET

01:18:42.884 --> 01:18:45.454
THERE. WE ALL KNOW THEM WHO

01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:46.088
WOULD HAVE IS THAT THE KIND OF

01:18:46.154 --> 01:18:46.855
POWER WE'RE CARRYING A POP THE

01:18:46.922 --> 01:18:47.489
TECHNOLOGY THAT DID THAT DIDN'T

01:18:47.556 --> 01:18:49.224
EXIST YOU KNOW JUST A DECADE OR

01:18:49.291 --> 01:18:51.693
TWO AGO. YOU KNOW THERE'S MORE

01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:52.327
COMPUTING POWER IN THESE THINGS

01:18:52.394 --> 01:18:53.462
AND THEN THE FIRST THE SPACE OF

01:18:53.528 --> 01:18:54.096
THE TOOK COMMAND OF THE MAN IN

01:18:54.162 --> 01:18:55.030
THE MOON. YOU KNOW THEY'RE

01:18:55.097 --> 01:18:55.497
THERE CONTINUES TO BE

01:18:55.564 --> 01:18:56.064
INNOVATIONS IN THIS WASTE

01:18:56.131 --> 01:18:56.665
MANAGEMENT SPACE AMINU SORTING

01:18:56.731 --> 01:18:57.566
MACHINES AND- AND NEW

01:18:57.632 --> 01:18:59.901
OPPORTUNITIES FOR HOLLERS AND-

01:18:59.968 --> 01:19:01.203
THAT WE DIDN'T ANTICIPATE A

01:19:01.269 --> 01:19:03.071
BEFORE. AND THAT WILL ONLY

01:19:03.138 --> 01:19:04.139
CONTINUE TO GROW I HOPE EVEN

01:19:04.206 --> 01:19:06.041
FASTER NOW THAT WE WAY ONCE WE

01:19:06.108 --> 01:19:07.442
PASS A BILL LIKE THIS WILL THAT

01:19:07.509 --> 01:19:08.243
WILL SEND MARKET SIGNAL TO THE

01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:10.078
ENTIRE WORLD. THAT THE WORLD'S

01:19:10.145 --> 01:19:11.379
FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IS

01:19:11.446 --> 01:19:12.647
ACTUALLY TAKING THIS WASTE

01:19:12.714 --> 01:19:14.516
REDUCTION GOAL SERIOUSLY AND

01:19:14.583 --> 01:19:15.951
MARKET OUT OF RESPOND WITH NEW

01:19:16.017 --> 01:19:17.119
SORTS OF TECHNOLOGIES AND

01:19:17.185 --> 01:19:18.787
INNOVATIONS IN. AND WAYS OF

01:19:18.854 --> 01:19:22.090
ADDRESSING AND SORTING AND- AND

01:19:22.157 --> 01:19:22.691
ALL OF THOSE SORTS OF THINGS.

01:19:22.757 --> 01:19:25.393
SO I. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE BIG

01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:27.462
BIG PROBLEMS. IT ACTUALLY IS A

01:19:27.529 --> 01:19:29.498
PROBLEM THAT WE CAN. I WHAT

01:19:29.564 --> 01:19:30.899
WHAT I LIKE ABOUT YOUR

01:19:30.966 --> 01:19:31.900
COMPARISON AB THIRTY TWO IS

01:19:31.967 --> 01:19:34.002
THAT IN SOME RESPECTS. IT'S A

01:19:34.069 --> 01:19:34.870
PROBLEM THAT WE KNOW WE CAN

01:19:34.936 --> 01:19:37.439
HELP TO ADDRESS HERE. BUT THE

01:19:37.506 --> 01:19:39.341
WE ACTUALLY. HAVE MORE

01:19:39.407 --> 01:19:40.842
SOLUTIONS HERE THAN WE EVEN HAD

01:19:40.909 --> 01:19:42.077
WITH A. B. THIRTY TWO THERE'S

01:19:42.144 --> 01:19:43.512
MORE LOW HANGING FRUIT IN THIS

01:19:43.578 --> 01:19:45.213
AREA WE KNOW THERE'S BETTER

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:47.082
PACKAGING OUT THERE. THE REASON

01:19:47.149 --> 01:19:48.350
WHY SO MUCH INDUSTRY HAS BEEN

01:19:48.416 --> 01:19:49.818
WILLING TO PLAY BALL WITH US IS

01:19:49.885 --> 01:19:51.386
BECAUSE THE MORE MORE FORWARD

01:19:51.453 --> 01:19:52.821
THINKING FOLKS IN INDUSTRY.

01:19:52.888 --> 01:19:54.589
HAVE BEEN ACTUALLY DEVELOPING

01:19:54.656 --> 01:19:56.591
THE PRODUCTS OVER THE YEARS TO

01:19:56.658 --> 01:19:58.093
RESPOND TO MARKETS LIKE OURS IN

01:19:58.160 --> 01:19:59.094
CALIFORNIA THAT ARE

01:19:59.161 --> 01:20:00.862
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE SUSTAINABLE.

01:20:00.929 --> 01:20:01.463
AND SO THEY KNOW THEY

01:20:01.530 --> 01:20:02.898
COMMITTEES BECAUSE THEY KNOW WE

01:20:02.964 --> 01:20:03.465
NEED TO MEET THESE GOALS WE

01:20:03.532 --> 01:20:04.366
THEY KNOW WE NEED TO MOVE IS A

01:20:04.432 --> 01:20:05.400
PLANET. TOWARD MEETING THE

01:20:05.467 --> 01:20:08.236
KINDS OF GOALS. AND DONE AND

01:20:08.303 --> 01:20:09.404
THE FOLKS THAT HAVE BEEN FOOT

01:20:09.471 --> 01:20:10.839
DRAGGING SOME OF YOU KNOW ABOUT

01:20:10.906 --> 01:20:11.907
THEIR LIVES THEIR LITTLE IF

01:20:11.973 --> 01:20:12.807
THEY'RE USUALLY FOLKS WHO HAVE

01:20:12.874 --> 01:20:14.743
BEEN. BEHIND THE EIGHT BALL IN

01:20:14.809 --> 01:20:16.077
TERMS OF DEVELOPMENT OF MORE

01:20:16.144 --> 01:20:18.480
SUSTAINABLE PACKAGING. AND DONE

01:20:18.547 --> 01:20:19.748
AND SOMETIMES YOU HAVE NATIONAL

01:20:19.814 --> 01:20:21.149
ORGANIZATIONS THAT THAT THAT

01:20:21.216 --> 01:20:21.917
STRUGGLE WITH THIS BECAUSE THEY

01:20:21.983 --> 01:20:23.752
HAVE SOME IN STATE FOLKS. THAT

01:20:23.818 --> 01:20:29.124
HAVE BEEN REALLY GOOD IN THIS.

01:20:29.191 --> 01:20:29.691
SPACE AND OTHERS THAT REALLY

01:20:29.758 --> 01:20:30.292
DON'T WANT TO MAKE MOVES IN A

01:20:30.358 --> 01:20:34.296
SPACE SO. BUT THIS IS

01:20:34.362 --> 01:20:35.230
ULTIMATELY ABOUT SEND ABOUT

01:20:35.297 --> 01:20:36.264
HELPING TO MOVE. THE ENTIRE

01:20:36.331 --> 01:20:38.099
SYSTEM AND I MEAN GLOBAL.

01:20:38.166 --> 01:20:38.600
TOWARD MORE SUSTAINABLE

01:20:38.667 --> 01:20:40.068
PACKAGING. I BE IN BECAUSE IN

01:20:40.135 --> 01:20:41.369
THE END OF THE DAY I SAID THIS

01:20:41.436 --> 01:20:42.871
BEFORE TO THIS COMMITTEE. WE

01:20:42.938 --> 01:20:44.272
WILL HAVE I WOULD DEEM THIS A

01:20:44.339 --> 01:20:46.274
FAILURE. IF WE DON'T SEND THE

01:20:46.341 --> 01:20:47.742
SORT OF MARKET SIGNALS GLOBALLY

01:20:47.809 --> 01:20:49.377
JUST AS WE DID WITH SB THIRTY

01:20:49.444 --> 01:20:49.978
TWO BUT I ACTUALLY WE CAN BE

01:20:50.045 --> 01:20:51.980
MORE EFFECTIVE IN THIS SPACE. I

01:20:52.047 --> 01:20:53.014
TOWARD MORE SUSTAINABLE

01:20:53.081 --> 01:20:54.916
PACKAGING PRODUCTS. BECAUSE

01:20:54.983 --> 01:20:57.752
EVERYBODY ALL OVER THE WORLD IS

01:20:57.819 --> 01:20:58.320
DROWNING. IN THEIR POLLUTION

01:20:58.386 --> 01:21:05.227
PROBLEM RIGHT NOW. HE FINISHED

01:21:05.293 --> 01:21:05.760
RECORDING YOU FINISH MISS

01:21:05.827 --> 01:21:11.166

WITH INDUSTRY I THINK THERE ARE

01:22:38.119 --> 01:22:38.620
A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY

01:22:38.687 --> 01:22:40.555

01:23:03.611 --> 01:23:05.547
NOT ENOUGH INCENTIVE FOR FOLKS

01:23:05.613 --> 01:23:06.948
IN INDUSTRY TO REALLY GET

01:23:07.015 --> 01:23:08.917

OUT THERE BUT A MODEL THAT WE

01:25:11.773 --> 01:25:13.041

IS ALWAYS BEEN IN THE BILL FROM

01:26:11.766 --> 01:26:14.035
THE VERY BEGINNING I YOU KNOW

01:26:14.102 --> 01:26:15.837
IT'S TRUE THAT THE INTENT

01:26:15.904 --> 01:26:17.005
LANGUAGES FOCUS ON PLASTIC AND

01:26:17.071 --> 01:26:19.874
ANY OTHER DAY THIS PLASTIC AND

01:26:19.941 --> 01:26:22.310
PLASTIC POLLUTION IS THE BIG

01:26:22.377 --> 01:26:23.845
BIG BIG PROBLEM THAT WE'RE

01:26:23.912 --> 01:26:25.580

01:26:25.647 --> 01:26:27.582
FROM A COLLECTION PERSPECTIVE

SIGNIFICANT RELIEF TO GLASS IN

THE CONTEXT OF. OF C. R. V. AND

01:26:38.693 --> 01:26:39.527
BASICALLY GIVING THEM THE

01:26:39.594 --> 01:26:41.095
EXEMPTION BECAUSE OF THEIR

01:26:41.162 --> 01:26:41.729
PARTISAN THAT THOUGH YOU THOSE

THAT'S THAT'S A BIG BIG

01:26:45.266 --> 01:26:46.200
EXEMPTION BUT IN THE END OF THE

01:26:46.267 --> 01:26:48.770
DAY. IF YOU LOOK AT SUCCESSFUL

THINK THIS IS JUST NERVOUSNESS.

01:27:02.016 --> 01:27:05.153
ABOUT A BILL AS BIG AS THIS

01:27:05.219 --> 01:27:08.289
FROM SOME FOLKS IN INDUSTRY.

01:27:08.356 --> 01:27:08.957
BUT THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN IN THE

01:27:09.023 --> 01:27:11.159
BILL IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE

01:27:11.225 --> 01:27:13.361
SYSTEM TO BE COMPREHENSIVE. OUT

01:27:13.428 --> 01:27:15.229

CORE GOALS OF THIS BILL. AND

01:27:27.775 --> 01:27:29.143
THAT'S WHY I CONTINUE TO

01:27:29.210 --> 01:27:30.511
BELIEVE THAT WE CAN YOU KNOW

01:27:30.578 --> 01:27:32.747
THROUGH THE COURSE OF AS THE AS

01:27:32.814 --> 01:27:34.515

NOT UP YOUR TIME WITH A GLASS

01:27:53.368 --> 01:27:56.204

RECENTLY MOST OF US HAVE BEEN

01:27:57.805 --> 01:27:59.273
CONFUSED THEN AND IT WASN'T

01:27:59.340 --> 01:28:00.608
JUST ABOUT PLASTICS GLASS IS

01:28:00.675 --> 01:28:03.878
ALWAYS BEEN AND THE BILL WAS

01:28:03.945 --> 01:28:05.980
ALWAYS ABOUT WASTE. REDUCTION

THAT WAS. YOU'RE IN IN THE

01:28:08.783 --> 01:28:10.318
LANGUAGE THERE'S NO QUESTION

01:28:10.385 --> 01:28:11.819
THAT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL FOCUS

01:28:11.886 --> 01:28:12.887
HAS BEEN ON PLASTICS BECAUSE

01:28:12.954 --> 01:28:14.489

01:28:14.555 --> 01:28:16.824

FOLKS CAME IN AND BEFORE WE-

01:28:24.332 --> 01:28:26.167

THIS SPACE IN IN IN GENERAL.

01:28:41.215 --> 01:28:42.383
AND THEY SAY WELL WE UNDERSTAND

01:28:42.450 --> 01:28:43.384
THAT AND THEY WERE WORRIED

01:28:43.451 --> 01:28:44.952
ABOUT DOUBLE CHARGING THAT WAS

01:28:45.019 --> 01:28:45.820
THEIR CORE CONCERNED THEY

01:28:45.887 --> 01:28:46.754
DIDN'T WANT TO BE CHARGED FOR

01:28:46.821 --> 01:28:49.157
BOTH THE BOTTLE BILL CRV. AND

01:28:49.223 --> 01:28:50.658
FOR SB FIFTY FOUR SO THAT'S

01:28:50.725 --> 01:28:51.559
WHAT WE CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA

01:28:51.626 --> 01:28:53.961
OKAY LET'S KEEP YOU OUT. IN

01:28:54.028 --> 01:28:55.363

WITH SB FIFTY FOUR TEN EIGHTY

01:29:01.703 --> 01:29:06.140
TEN EIGHTY. AND THAT WAS ENOUGH.

01:29:06.207 --> 01:29:06.741
BECAUSE I THINK THEY RECOGNIZE

01:29:06.808 --> 01:29:07.375
WHAT WE WERE SAYING THAT IN THE

01:29:07.442 --> 01:29:11.646
END OF THE DAY. THEY'RE THEY'RE

01:29:11.713 --> 01:29:12.246
IN A STRONG PLACE BECAUSE THEY

01:29:12.313 --> 01:29:19.020
HAVE TO TIE RECYCLABILITY GOALS.

01:29:19.087 --> 01:29:20.888

RECYCLE REGULATORY FEE AT THE

POSITION ON THE BILL OKAY I AM

01:31:02.123 --> 01:31:04.358
HERE TO TELL YOU THAT AS

01:31:04.425 --> 01:31:04.859
DRAFTED WE DO THINK. THE

01:31:04.926 --> 01:31:05.459
DEPARTMENT CAN IMPLEMENT THIS

01:31:05.526 --> 01:31:08.529
BILL. AND DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

01:31:08.596 --> 01:31:10.531
OF HOW LARGE THE TASK WILL BE

01:31:10.598 --> 01:31:11.999
OF IMPLEMENTING THE BILL ARE WE

01:31:12.066 --> 01:31:14.302
TALKING ABOUT. FIVE EMPLOYEES A

01:31:14.368 --> 01:31:16.504
HUNDRED EMPLOYEES AT THOUSAND

01:31:16.571 --> 01:31:17.104
EMPLOYEES DO YOU HAVE ANY CLUE

01:31:17.171 --> 01:31:17.672
OF WHAT THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE

01:31:17.738 --> 01:31:20.775
GOOD BUT IT'S A FAIR QUESTION

01:31:20.842 --> 01:31:21.843
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO ANSWER

01:31:21.909 --> 01:31:22.343
THAT QUESTION WITH ANY

01:31:22.410 --> 01:31:24.612
SPECIFICITY BECAUSE- THE- THE

01:31:24.679 --> 01:31:26.547
WAY THE BILL IS. CONSTRUCTED IS

01:31:26.614 --> 01:31:27.481
THAT IT PROVIDES MAXIMUM

01:31:27.548 --> 01:31:29.517
FLEXIBILITY TO THE PRODUCERS TO

01:31:29.584 --> 01:31:31.853
DETERMINE HOW THEY COMPLY. AND

01:31:31.919 --> 01:31:33.487
THEIR CHOICE OF COMPLIANCE WILL

01:31:33.554 --> 01:31:35.122
IMPACT THE RESOURCES NECESSARY

01:31:35.189 --> 01:31:37.158
TO OVERSEE THE PROGRAM. WITH

01:31:37.225 --> 01:31:38.993
RESPECT TO THE FEE ITSELF I.

01:31:39.060 --> 01:31:41.829
ANTICIPATE THIS WILL BE. OF OUR

01:31:41.896 --> 01:31:43.431
SMALLER PROGRAMS BECAUSE THE

01:31:43.497 --> 01:31:45.700
FEE IS STRICTLY FOR THE

01:31:45.766 --> 01:31:46.834
REASONABLE REGULATORY COSTS OF

01:31:46.901 --> 01:31:48.135
IMPLEMENTING THE PROGRAM

01:31:48.202 --> 01:31:50.171
THERE'S NO WE'RE NOT GENERATING

01:31:50.238 --> 01:31:52.106
REVENUE TO SUPPORT MARKETS FOR

01:31:52.173 --> 01:31:53.040
ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN THE

01:31:53.107 --> 01:31:56.310
SPRING IN THIS. IN THIS BILL SO

01:31:56.377 --> 01:31:56.844
THAT FEE WILL BE STRICTLY

01:31:56.911 --> 01:31:59.213
LIMITED ON ON THAT BASIS. ON

01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:01.349
THE TO THE EXTENT THAT.

01:32:01.415 --> 01:32:02.516
COMPLIANCE IS DRIVEN THROUGH

01:32:02.583 --> 01:32:05.586
ONE MECHANISM OVER ANOTHER. IT

01:32:05.653 --> 01:32:06.187
WOULD IMPACT THE MAT RESOURCES

01:32:06.254 --> 01:32:08.956
THAT WE NEED. TO BE DIRECT IN

01:32:09.023 --> 01:32:10.591
RESPONSE THIS IS A VERY

01:32:10.658 --> 01:32:11.893
SIGNIFICANT PROGRAM AND IT WILL

01:32:11.959 --> 01:32:14.128
REQUIRE. A SIGNIFICANT RESPONSE

01:32:14.195 --> 01:32:14.729
FROM FROM THE MINISTRATION TO

01:32:14.795 --> 01:32:17.732
IMPLEMENT. WITH WHAT'S ANOTHER

01:32:17.798 --> 01:32:20.001
EXAMPLE OF ANOTHER PROGRAM WITH

01:32:20.067 --> 01:32:21.269
THIS TYPE OF DIVERSITY IN THE

01:32:21.335 --> 01:32:22.970
FRONT END SINCE YOU'RE SAYING

01:32:23.037 --> 01:32:24.372
IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE FRONT

01:32:24.438 --> 01:32:25.840
AND IF YOU BY DOING WHAT YOU'LL

01:32:25.907 --> 01:32:27.475
HAVE TO DO. AND HOW HAS THAT

01:32:27.541 --> 01:32:30.011
WORKED OUT. SO WE DON'T I CAN'T

01:32:30.077 --> 01:32:31.812
THINK OF AN ANALOGOUS PROGRAM

01:32:31.879 --> 01:32:33.347
RIGHT NOW MOST OF OUR STATUTES

01:32:33.414 --> 01:32:34.415
THAT WE IMPLEMENT EVERY

01:32:34.482 --> 01:32:35.483
SPECIFIC SO WE AS YOU KNOW WE

01:32:35.549 --> 01:32:36.183
HAVE THE FOUR IF YOU ARE

01:32:36.250 --> 01:32:37.919
PROGRAMS THEY'RE VERY SPECIFIC.

01:32:37.985 --> 01:32:39.153
AND THAT WE IMPLEMENT THE

01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:40.388
BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING

01:32:40.454 --> 01:32:43.190
PROGRAM AGAIN IS VERY SPECIFIC

01:32:43.257 --> 01:32:44.425
TO PRESCRIBE HOW HOW WE

01:32:44.492 --> 01:32:47.395
IMPLEMENT THAT PROGRAM. SO WE

01:32:47.461 --> 01:32:49.163
DON'T HAVE WELL THERE'S NOTHING

01:32:49.230 --> 01:32:51.899
CONTEMPLATED IN HERE THAT IS A

01:32:51.966 --> 01:32:52.667
COMPLIANCE MECHANISM THAT WOULD

01:32:52.733 --> 01:32:53.434
BE SOMETHING WERE UNFAMILIAR

01:32:53.501 --> 01:32:55.937
WITH. WE DON'T HAVE AN

01:32:56.003 --> 01:33:00.308
ANALOGOUS STATUTE THAT HAS THE

01:33:00.374 --> 01:33:00.841
BROAD ARRAY OF COMPLIANCE

01:33:00.908 --> 01:33:01.409
MECHANISMS AVAILABLE TO THE

WE'VE HEARD A LOT TODAY ABOUT

01:33:11.919 --> 01:33:13.321
TRY TO REMOVE PRODUCT OUT OF

01:33:13.387 --> 01:33:16.123
THE STREAM RIGHT MOVING WASTE

01:33:16.190 --> 01:33:16.624

THOUGHT PROCESS IF WE'RE GOING

01:33:31.005 --> 01:33:32.073
TO DO ALL THIS IF WE'RE GOING

01:33:32.139 --> 01:33:33.674
TO MEET OUR GOALS. WE HAVE TO

01:33:33.741 --> 01:33:35.309
HAVE A FACILITY IN A SYSTEM TO

01:33:35.376 --> 01:33:37.178

01:34:11.512 --> 01:34:13.414
COLLECTING. TOOK INVOLVE THE

01:34:13.481 --> 01:34:14.915
SET THAT GETS MISSED BY THAT

01:34:14.982 --> 01:34:17.551
FIRST. BY THE BY THE PRIMARY

01:34:17.618 --> 01:34:20.154
MARKS. ON ME THE DAY THIS IS

01:34:20.221 --> 01:34:22.356
ABOUT REAL STRONG COLLECTION

01:34:22.423 --> 01:34:23.958
AND THEN AND THEN CREATING THE

01:34:24.025 --> 01:34:27.028
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR UTILIZING

01:34:27.094 --> 01:34:28.562
THAT MATERIAL. AND A LOT OF

01:34:28.629 --> 01:34:31.165
IT'S ALREADY HAPPENING YOU DO

01:34:31.232 --> 01:34:32.166
SEE A LOT OF IN STATE

01:34:32.233 --> 01:34:33.901
MANUFACTURES AND SOME OUT OF

01:34:33.968 --> 01:34:34.902
STATE THAT ARE DOING REALLY

01:34:34.969 --> 01:34:36.637
GOOD WORK IN THIS SPACE ALREADY

01:34:36.704 --> 01:34:38.606
AND I. YOU KNOW I OKAY BYE BYE

01:34:38.672 --> 01:34:39.807
BUT THE NESTLE LAN NOT TOO

LONG AGO AND THEY ARE YOU HAVE

01:34:41.609 --> 01:34:42.543
WON A PERCENT RECYCLED. YOU

01:34:42.610 --> 01:34:43.711
KNOW PLASTIC BOTTLES THAT THEY

01:34:43.778 --> 01:34:45.212
THEY STARTED MANUFACTURING AND

01:34:45.279 --> 01:34:46.047
THEY'VE GOT OTHER ISSUES BUT

01:34:46.113 --> 01:34:47.581
YOU KNOW THAT BUT THAT WAS A

01:34:47.648 --> 01:34:49.650
REALLY IMPRESSIVE. TO SEE SAID

01:34:49.717 --> 01:34:50.584
SAID THERE THERE IS

01:34:50.651 --> 01:34:51.452
INFRASTRUCTURE OUT THERE IT

01:34:51.519 --> 01:34:52.953
NEEDS TO GROW WE NEED TO BUILD

01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:53.621
OUT AND WE DO WANT TO

01:34:53.687 --> 01:34:55.156
INCENTIVIZE IT HAPPENING RIGHT

01:34:55.222 --> 01:34:56.190
HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:34:56.257 --> 01:34:57.191
I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF JOBS

01:34:57.258 --> 01:34:58.492
OPPORTUNITIES AND- ASSOCIATED

01:34:58.559 --> 01:35:00.694
WITH THIS RIGHT HERE AT HOME.

01:35:00.761 --> 01:35:01.629
IN THERE AND THERE'S LANGUAGE

01:35:01.695 --> 01:35:02.696
IN THE BILL THAT THAT SPEAKS TO

01:35:02.763 --> 01:35:05.299
THAT. BUT THAT IS CERTAINLY ONE

01:35:05.366 --> 01:35:10.604
OF THE THINGS. THAT WERE REALLY

01:35:10.671 --> 01:35:17.011
HOPING TO KIND OF. PUSH UP

01:35:17.078 --> 01:35:17.945
THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE

01:35:18.012 --> 01:35:18.712
IMPLEMENTATION THIS BILL HI AT

01:35:18.779 --> 01:35:19.346
THE END OF ANY COMMENTS MARK.

01:35:19.413 --> 01:35:20.514
MADAM CHAIR THROUGH THE CHAIR

01:35:20.581 --> 01:35:21.549
OF LIKE TO RESPOND TO THAT

01:35:21.615 --> 01:35:22.183
QUESTION GO AHEAD A AND THAT'S

01:35:22.249 --> 01:35:22.817
THAT'S EXACTLY THE POINT. THAT

01:35:22.883 --> 01:35:23.317
WE MADE IN OUR TESTIMONY

01:35:23.384 --> 01:35:24.452
REGARDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:35:24.518 --> 01:35:25.019
FEE IN THE NEED TO GENERATE

01:35:25.086 --> 01:35:28.055
REVENUE TO PROVIDE FOR THAT.

01:35:28.122 --> 01:35:30.391
INFRASTRUCTURE UP. AND WITHOUT

01:35:30.458 --> 01:35:31.692
THAT I THINK IT'S A IT'S A

01:35:31.759 --> 01:35:33.461
CRITICAL COMPONENT THAT THE

01:35:33.527 --> 01:35:35.596
THAT. UNDERMINES THE PROVISIONS

01:35:35.663 --> 01:35:37.665
IN THIS BILL AND SO. FORTH FOR

01:35:37.731 --> 01:35:39.033
THOSE REASONS WERE VERY

01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:40.734
ENCOURAGED THAT THESE AUTHORS

01:35:40.801 --> 01:35:43.304
HAVE CHOSEN TO. COMMIT TO

01:35:43.370 --> 01:35:44.672
MOVING FORWARD WITH THAT

01:35:44.738 --> 01:35:46.407
INFRASTRUCTURE FEE. FOR NEXT

01:35:46.474 --> 01:35:48.576
YEAR. AND SO I HOPE THAT THAT

01:35:48.642 --> 01:35:50.544
ADDRESSES YOUR QUESTION. BUT

01:35:50.611 --> 01:35:52.079
THAT'S THAT'S INTENSE ESSENTIAL

01:35:52.146 --> 01:35:54.014
COMPONENT. BUT A LOT OF WAYS I

01:35:54.081 --> 01:35:54.682
FEEL LIKE WITHOUT THE

01:35:54.748 --> 01:35:56.917
INFRASTRUCTURE. WAS A WASTE OF

01:35:56.984 --> 01:35:58.619
TIME. I MEAN WE'RE JUST GOT THE

01:35:58.686 --> 01:35:59.820
CART BEFORE THE HORSE. BECAUSE

01:35:59.887 --> 01:36:01.455
WE'RE NOT GONNA PROCESS HERE.

01:36:01.522 --> 01:36:02.823
THEN WHAT ARE WE DOING. WE'RE

01:36:02.890 --> 01:36:04.091
SHIPPING IT TO OTHER COUNTRIES

01:36:04.158 --> 01:36:05.326
THAT ARE GOING TO BURN IT. AND

01:36:05.392 --> 01:36:06.494
ALL THESE GREENHOUSE GASES ALL

01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:07.061
THESE EMISSIONS THINGS WERE

01:36:07.128 --> 01:36:10.965
TALKING. ABOUT GO TO OUT THE-

01:36:11.031 --> 01:36:15.035
YOU KNOW JUST BY THE WAYSIDE.

01:36:15.102 --> 01:36:16.103
AREN'T THEY THEY'RE ALMOST TWO

01:36:16.170 --> 01:36:17.338
HORSES HELPING TO DRIVE THE CAR

01:36:17.404 --> 01:36:18.539
RIGHT BECAUSE IN THE END OF THE

01:36:18.606 --> 01:36:19.940
DAY. WITHOUT THESE KINDS OF

01:36:20.007 --> 01:36:21.208
GOALS AND MANDATES. THERE'S NOT

01:36:21.275 --> 01:36:22.576
GONNA BE ENOUGH INCENTIVE TO

01:36:22.643 --> 01:36:23.644
BUILD OUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE

01:36:23.711 --> 01:36:25.179
PART OF OR TRYING TO DO HERE.

01:36:25.246 --> 01:36:26.647
IS SEND THE MARKET SIGNALS AND

01:36:26.714 --> 01:36:28.382
THE REGULATORY SIGNALS. THAT

01:36:28.449 --> 01:36:30.784
WILL HELP TO PUSH EVERYBODY TO

01:36:30.851 --> 01:36:31.385
START TO TAKE THIS PROBLEMS

01:36:31.452 --> 01:36:32.186
YEARS BECAUSE YOUR APPS YOU

01:36:32.253 --> 01:36:34.255
RIGHT RIGHT NOW. ALL THIS STUFF

01:36:34.321 --> 01:36:35.422
IS JUST GETTING IT'S A GAME A

01:36:35.489 --> 01:36:36.957
TREE EYES. AND TALK AND SENT

01:36:37.024 --> 01:36:38.692
OFF TO ASIA INCINERATED IT'S

01:36:38.759 --> 01:36:40.694
GOING SENT TO OUR LANDFILLS.

01:36:40.761 --> 01:36:41.529
IT'S GETTING IT'S ENDING UP IN

01:36:41.595 --> 01:36:45.199
A RIVERS AND STREAMS. AND WORLD

01:36:45.266 --> 01:36:46.333
DURING THE COST OF THAT RIGHT

01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:46.867
OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE

01:36:46.934 --> 01:36:48.335
SPENDING HALF A BILLION DOLLARS

01:36:48.402 --> 01:36:49.603
A YEAR JUST ON LITTER CLEAN UP

01:36:49.670 --> 01:36:51.405
ALONE. THE RATES ARE ABOUT TO

01:36:51.472 --> 01:36:52.373
GO OUT BECAUSE THE BOMBS

01:36:52.439 --> 01:36:53.140
FALLING DOWN THE HALLWAYS

01:36:53.207 --> 01:36:54.909
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. I AND SO

01:36:54.975 --> 01:36:59.480
IT'S OUR TAXPAYERS IT. IN OUR

01:36:59.547 --> 01:37:00.014
REPAIRS THAT ARE GONNA BE

01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:00.548
BEARING THE BURDEN OF OUR

01:37:00.614 --> 01:37:05.853
INACTION. AB SO THEY CAN I

01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:06.487
DON'T CARRY CYCLE ONCE RESPOND

01:37:06.554 --> 01:37:07.087
TO WHAT YOU MEANT. YOU TALK A

01:37:07.154 --> 01:37:07.688
LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT BUT- RIGHT

01:37:07.755 --> 01:37:08.289
NOW IN THE FEES. THERE IS NO

01:37:08.355 --> 01:37:09.557
LIMIT TO WHAT THESE FEES CAN BE

01:37:09.623 --> 01:37:10.090
CURRENTLY WITHIN THIS BILL

01:37:10.157 --> 01:37:11.358
RIGHT. I KNOW WE HAVE NOT SAID

01:37:11.425 --> 01:37:13.260
A- A FEE SCHEDULE WHAT WAS IT.

01:37:13.327 --> 01:37:14.728
ABOUT TWENTY SIX IS THE LIMIT.

01:37:14.795 --> 01:37:16.030
THERE ARE THERE THERE'S NOT A-

01:37:16.096 --> 01:37:18.465
NUMERICAL LIMIT. BUT I DON'T

01:37:18.532 --> 01:37:19.466
THINK IT'S ACCURATE SAY THERE'S

01:37:19.533 --> 01:37:22.203
NO LIMIT BECAUSE- AGAIN. ONCE

01:37:22.269 --> 01:37:23.571
THE BILL IS PASSED IT'S OUR

01:37:23.637 --> 01:37:24.572
OBLIGATION TO DEVELOP

01:37:24.638 --> 01:37:26.273
REGULATIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE

01:37:26.340 --> 01:37:27.708
PROGRAM RIGHT AND WHEN WE DO

01:37:27.775 --> 01:37:29.210
THAT. THE BURDEN IS ON THE

01:37:29.276 --> 01:37:30.678
DEPARTMENT. TO IMPLEMENT IN A

01:37:30.744 --> 01:37:32.279
WAY THAT IS THE LEAST BIRDS

01:37:32.346 --> 01:37:33.547
IMPOSSIBLE AND THAT INCLUDES

01:37:33.614 --> 01:37:35.349
THE FEE STRUCTURE. SO WE ARE

01:37:35.416 --> 01:37:36.684
GOVERNED BY THE RULES OF THE

01:37:36.750 --> 01:37:37.751
OFFICE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW WE

01:37:37.818 --> 01:37:39.086
PRODUCE REGULATIONS AND THAT

01:37:39.153 --> 01:37:40.788
IS. PART AND PARCEL OF HOW. WE

01:37:40.854 --> 01:37:42.423
HAVE TO DEVELOP THOSE RULES SO

01:37:42.489 --> 01:37:43.390
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE ECONOMIC

01:37:43.457 --> 01:37:45.059
ANALYSIS THAT'S WHY AWAY ALL.

01:37:45.125 --> 01:37:48.495
REVIEWS ARE RULES AND MAKE SURE

01:37:48.562 --> 01:37:49.096
THAT WE'RE DOING IN THE LEAST

01:37:49.163 --> 01:37:53.133
BURDENSOME. WAY POSSIBLE. SO

01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:54.134
AGAIN AND ALSO TO JUST ADD THAT

01:37:54.201 --> 01:37:55.436
THAT FEE. IS SPECIFICALLY FOR

01:37:55.502 --> 01:37:56.270
THE COST OF. MANAGING THE

01:37:56.337 --> 01:37:58.606
PROGRAM. SO I DON'T ANTICIPATE.

01:37:58.672 --> 01:37:59.773
YOU KNOW WE HAVE A NUMBER OF

01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:00.908
PROGRAMS THE DEPARTMENT WHETHER

01:38:00.975 --> 01:38:02.443
IT'S- YOU KNOW THE WAY STE. THE

01:38:02.509 --> 01:38:03.978
ENTIRE FEE THESE ARE ALL. VERY

01:38:04.044 --> 01:38:05.446
HIGH TENS OF MILLIONS OF

01:38:05.512 --> 01:38:06.714
DOLLARS. BECAUSE WE'RE NOT ONLY

01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:09.250
MANAGING THE PROGRAM. BUT WE'RE

01:38:09.316 --> 01:38:10.451
PROVIDING MARK INCENTIVES AND

01:38:10.517 --> 01:38:11.719
PAYMENTS FOR THOSE FEES ARE

01:38:11.785 --> 01:38:14.421
HIGHER. THIS FEE IS NOT GONNA.

01:38:14.488 --> 01:38:16.123
AS DRAFTED DOES NOT INCLUDE

01:38:16.190 --> 01:38:17.057
THOSE OTHER TYPES OF.

01:38:17.124 --> 01:38:19.460
PROGRAMMATIC ACTIVITY. USUALLY

01:38:19.526 --> 01:38:21.328
WHEN WE VOTE ON FEES LIKE THIS.

01:38:21.395 --> 01:38:22.963
THERE'S A- A NUMBER THAT WE'RE

01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:24.565
LOOKING AT. THERE'S A THERE'S A

01:38:24.632 --> 01:38:25.466
SET OF NUMBERS THAT WE CAN GO

01:38:25.532 --> 01:38:27.234
BACK TO OUR CONSTITUENCIES AND

01:38:27.301 --> 01:38:28.402
SAY HEY. FOR THIS PRICE WERE

01:38:28.469 --> 01:38:30.638
DOING X. Y. AND Z. I DON'T SEE

01:38:30.704 --> 01:38:32.039
THAT HERE. SO WE'RE GONNA JUST

01:38:32.106 --> 01:38:34.808
MAKE A BLANKET VOTE. TO JUST

01:38:34.875 --> 01:38:36.110
WILL ALLOW FEES TO BE INCREASE

01:38:36.176 --> 01:38:38.245
AT CUT BY FRANKLY THE WILL OF

01:38:38.312 --> 01:38:39.179
CAL RECYCLE. INTEL YOU GUYS GET

01:38:39.246 --> 01:38:41.482
THE- THE MONEY YOU NEED TO

01:38:41.548 --> 01:38:45.552
IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM. I GUESS

01:38:45.619 --> 01:38:50.357
THE CLOSEST ANALOGY WOULD BE.

01:38:50.424 --> 01:38:50.891
IN ANY PR PROGRAM WHEN WE

01:38:50.958 --> 01:38:51.792
IMPLEMENT ANY PR PROGRAM. WE

01:38:51.859 --> 01:38:53.794
HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO REQUIRED

01:38:53.861 --> 01:38:54.428
THE STEWARDSHIP ORGANIZATION TO

01:38:54.495 --> 01:38:54.962
COVER THE STATE'S COST OF

01:38:55.029 --> 01:38:55.529
RUNNING. THAT PROGRAM THAT

01:38:55.596 --> 01:38:58.232
WOULD INCLUDE. REVIEWING THEIR

01:38:58.299 --> 01:39:00.834
PLAN RIGHT AND- ADDRESSING

01:39:00.901 --> 01:39:02.936
ENFORCEMENT ETCETERA. SO I

01:39:03.003 --> 01:39:03.871
GUESS WOULD BE ANALOGOUS TO

01:39:03.937 --> 01:39:06.040
THAT SO WE WOULD DETERMINE WHAT

01:39:06.106 --> 01:39:07.975
THE COSTS ARE JUST TO IMPLEMENT

01:39:08.042 --> 01:39:09.610
THE PROGRAM. AND WE WOULD SAID.

01:39:09.677 --> 01:39:11.145
I APPRECIATE THE CENTER TAKE

01:39:11.211 --> 01:39:12.579
THE SONG BECAUSE THIS IS A HUGE

01:39:12.646 --> 01:39:14.848
ISSUE BUT I MEAN AB THIRTY TWO

01:39:14.915 --> 01:39:15.449
WAS MENTIONED A COUPLE TIMES

01:39:15.516 --> 01:39:16.717
AND IT WAS HERE BEFORE I GOT

01:39:16.784 --> 01:39:18.485
HERE. BUT BECAUSE OF THE SUCH A

01:39:18.552 --> 01:39:20.654
BIG ISSUE IT WAS ALSO WE TOOK

01:39:20.721 --> 01:39:21.622
TIME WE TOOK A COUPLE YEARS TO

01:39:21.689 --> 01:39:22.823
DO IS A GOOD THING IN A BEING A

01:39:22.890 --> 01:39:24.425
TO YOUR BILL. SO SOME OF THESE

01:39:24.491 --> 01:39:25.826
ISSUES LIKE THIS I THERE'S

01:39:25.893 --> 01:39:27.127
CLEARLY A LOT LEFT OUT HERE TO

01:39:27.194 --> 01:39:28.996
BE DISCUSSED AND WORKED OUT.

01:39:29.063 --> 01:39:29.563
YOU KNOW IT'S CERTAINLY MY

01:39:29.630 --> 01:39:30.698
RECOMMENDATION WOULD TURN IT

01:39:30.764 --> 01:39:31.865
INTO A TO YOUR BILL I KNOW

01:39:31.932 --> 01:39:32.599
THAT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO

01:39:32.666 --> 01:39:34.968
HAPPEN BUT I CERTAINLY.

01:39:35.035 --> 01:39:35.969
APPRECIATE THE TIME A CONCERN

01:39:36.036 --> 01:39:38.305
FOR CENTER IN PROCEDURE YEAH. I

01:39:38.372 --> 01:39:40.741
APPRECIATE THAT SOME MEMBER.

01:39:40.808 --> 01:39:41.942
ONE THING I MENTIONED YOU KNOW

01:39:42.009 --> 01:39:44.011
WE APPROVE. THAT THE SYSTEM

01:39:44.078 --> 01:39:44.978
THEY SET UP WITH A PRICE THE

01:39:45.045 --> 01:39:46.180
FEES THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS

01:39:46.246 --> 01:39:47.414
AND SO THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES

01:39:47.481 --> 01:39:48.949
FOR US TO WIN THERE. AND THE

01:39:49.016 --> 01:39:49.817
WHOLE THING IS TETHERED UNDER

01:39:49.883 --> 01:39:52.386
PROPOSITION TWENTY SIX. THAT

01:39:52.453 --> 01:39:58.359
REALLY DOES LIMIT THE. EXTENT

THE ADMINISTRATION IS GOING TO

01:41:31.885 --> 01:41:33.821
WEIGH IN. AND THEY'RE GONNA

THAT WE EASE ALL SIDES OF IT WE

01:42:17.898 --> 01:42:18.632
HEARD IN THE TESTIMONY THERE

01:42:18.699 --> 01:42:20.701
WAS PEOPLE THAT WERE IN FAVOR

01:42:20.767 --> 01:42:22.102
GROUPS THAT WERE IN FAVOR

01:42:22.169 --> 01:42:24.538
NEWMAN MITCH CAME NOW THEY'RE

01:42:24.605 --> 01:42:25.172
NOT IN FAVOR. YOU GOT THIS BACK

01:42:25.239 --> 01:42:29.643
AND FORTH. WITH THIS BILL. THAT

01:42:29.710 --> 01:42:31.178
I THINK THE UNITING MISTER

01:42:31.245 --> 01:42:32.713
FLOORS RIGHT I THINK WE TOOK

01:42:32.779 --> 01:42:34.581
THIS IS THE TO YOUR PROCESS.

01:42:34.648 --> 01:42:36.450
THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO

01:42:36.517 --> 01:42:39.019
AND REALLY IRON IT OUT. WE CAN

01:42:39.086 --> 01:42:41.321
MAKE THIS A LOT BETTER THAN IT

01:42:41.388 --> 01:42:42.990
IS AND I KNOW THE ARGUMENT BACK

01:42:43.056 --> 01:42:44.725
TO THAT IS GOING TO BE DON'T

01:42:44.791 --> 01:42:45.359
LET THE PERFECT. GET IN THE WAY

01:42:45.425 --> 01:42:47.494
OF THE GOOD. BUT THERE ARE SO

01:42:47.561 --> 01:42:51.431
MANY THINGS AT STAKE HERE. THE

01:42:51.498 --> 01:42:53.100
PROCESS THE MANUFACTURING HOW

01:42:53.166 --> 01:42:55.269
ALL OF THESE THINGS GO TOGETHER

01:42:55.335 --> 01:42:56.570
A LOT OF THIS CAME UP BECAUSE

01:42:56.637 --> 01:42:58.605
THE TRADE WAR WITH CHINA WHICH

01:42:58.672 --> 01:43:00.207
WERE NOW STARTING TO SEE AN END

01:43:00.274 --> 01:43:02.342
TO. WE'RE STARTING TO SEE A LOT

01:43:02.409 --> 01:43:03.610
OF THESE THINGS HAPPEN. AND I

01:43:03.677 --> 01:43:07.781
MEAN. WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE

01:43:07.848 --> 01:43:09.883
THAT AS THIS MOVES FORWARD

01:43:09.950 --> 01:43:11.552
THERE'S ABILITIES TO REIN IT IN

01:43:11.618 --> 01:43:13.020
THERE'S ABILITIES TO MAKE SURE

01:43:13.086 --> 01:43:15.322
THAT THE COMPANIES ARE ABLE TO

01:43:15.389 --> 01:43:17.057
ADAPT TO THIS THAT YOU KNOW

01:43:17.124 --> 01:43:18.926
YOU'RE RIGHT THE TECHNOLOGY IS

01:43:18.992 --> 01:43:21.028
HUGE BUT YOU CAN'T FORCE FED

01:43:21.094 --> 01:43:24.698
IT. TO THEM. BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE

01:43:24.765 --> 01:43:28.235
SEEN. EVERYWHERE ELSE IS WHEN

01:43:28.302 --> 01:43:31.171

DISCUSSION HAN. YOU KNOW OUR

01:45:54.514 --> 01:45:54.981
ANY ISSUE WAS RAISED ABOUT

01:45:55.048 --> 01:46:01.521
TECHNOLOGY. AND ARE I SUPPOSE I

01:46:01.588 --> 01:46:02.255
WAS JUST GONNA SAY TO FOLKS

01:46:02.322 --> 01:46:04.458
THAT THE TECHNOLOGY IS THERE WE

01:46:04.524 --> 01:46:06.259
ARE ALREADY HAVING INDUSTRY

01:46:06.326 --> 01:46:08.228
STEP UP ALL OVER THE WORLD BUT

01:46:08.295 --> 01:46:10.330
CERTAINLY TO ATTRACT CERTAIN

01:46:10.397 --> 01:46:13.100
MARKETS HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:46:13.166 --> 01:46:13.734
WITH THIS IS SUBSTANTIALLY MORE

01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:17.637
SUSTAINABLE PACKAGING IT. THE

01:46:17.704 --> 01:46:18.905
MARKET NEED TO LIVE OF

01:46:18.972 --> 01:46:20.240
KNOWLEDGE TO PUSH US MORE IN

01:46:20.307 --> 01:46:23.410
THAT DIRECTION HI THE VIRGIN

01:46:23.477 --> 01:46:24.778
PLASTIC THAT HAS BEEN AT THE

01:46:24.845 --> 01:46:25.746
HEART OF SO MUCH OF OUR

01:46:25.812 --> 01:46:28.482
PACKAGING IS SO DAMAGING AND SO

01:46:28.548 --> 01:46:29.750
COSTLY IN THE LONG TERM FOR ALL

01:46:29.816 --> 01:46:32.619
OF US IN FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS

01:46:32.686 --> 01:46:33.253
AS RATE PAYERS AS TAXPAYERS AND

01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:38.125
AS- HUMAN BEINGS. BUT THERE IS

01:46:38.191 --> 01:46:39.659
TECHNOLOGY THERE IT'S RIGHT

01:46:39.726 --> 01:46:41.628
THERE IT JUST NEEDS A LITTLE

01:46:41.695 --> 01:46:42.996
BIT OF HELP THIS REMINDS ME OF

01:46:43.063 --> 01:46:45.198
THE EXAMPLE OF LOS ANGELES IN

01:46:45.265 --> 01:46:46.233
THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES WHEN THE

01:46:46.299 --> 01:46:47.334
AVERAGE KID WAS GOING UP WITH

01:46:47.400 --> 01:46:49.202
HALF OF THE LUNG CAPACITY OF

01:46:49.269 --> 01:46:50.270
KIDS GOING UP IN OTHER PARTS OF

01:46:50.337 --> 01:46:50.771
THE COUNTRY BECAUSE HOW

01:46:50.837 --> 01:46:53.273
TERRIBLE OUR SMOG WAS IN THE

01:46:53.340 --> 01:46:55.475
CITY OF LOS ANGELES. THERE WERE

01:46:55.542 --> 01:46:56.543
SOME CARS ON THE MARKET THAT

01:46:56.610 --> 01:46:57.310
WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER

01:46:57.377 --> 01:46:59.613
POLLUTING SIGNIFICANTLY LESS

01:46:59.679 --> 01:47:01.515
CONTRIBUTING TO OUR THE SMOG

01:47:01.581 --> 01:47:03.517
PROBLEM AND YET THEY WERE JUST

01:47:03.583 --> 01:47:05.952
A LITTLE BIT MORE EXPENSIVE AND

01:47:06.019 --> 01:47:06.586
THERE'S WASN'T ENOUGH INCENTIVE

01:47:06.653 --> 01:47:08.989
TO GET THOSE OUT ON THE MARKET.

01:47:09.055 --> 01:47:10.190
AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT

01:47:10.257 --> 01:47:11.057
THE GOVERNMENT STEPPED UP AND

01:47:11.124 --> 01:47:12.125
SAID LOOK YOU GOT TO DO BETTER

01:47:12.192 --> 01:47:13.226
ON THE- STREET THEY KICKED AND

01:47:13.293 --> 01:47:14.895
SCREAMED. THEY DIDN'T LIKE IT.

01:47:14.961 --> 01:47:16.196
BUT THERE WERE INNOVATORS IN

01:47:16.263 --> 01:47:17.831
THAT MARKET THEY'RE INNOVATORS

01:47:17.898 --> 01:47:18.765
IN THAT INDUSTRY WHO STEPPED UP

01:47:18.832 --> 01:47:20.967
GOT THOSE CARS ON THE ROAD. AND

01:47:21.034 --> 01:47:22.302
NOW WE HAVE DOUBLE THE NUMBER

01:47:22.369 --> 01:47:24.704
OF PEOPLE LIVING IN LA AND

01:47:24.771 --> 01:47:25.338
BETTER QUALITY. EVEN THOUGH I'M

01:47:25.405 --> 01:47:27.841
STILL DRIVING AROUND IN CARS.

01:47:27.908 --> 01:47:29.176
HI AND SO IT THERE THE

01:47:29.242 --> 01:47:31.812
TECHNOLOGY IS THERE. IT EXISTS

01:47:31.878 --> 01:47:34.314
TODAY. WE KNOW WE CAN SCALE

01:47:34.381 --> 01:47:36.416
THIS. WE KNOW WE CAN DO THIS.

01:47:36.483 --> 01:47:40.187
AND IF WE DON'T ACT. SOON WE

01:47:40.253 --> 01:47:42.055
WILL CONTINUE TO DOUBLE DOWN ON

01:47:42.122 --> 01:47:44.724
A CRISIS THAT IS DROWNING. OUR
