THANKS GOING OUT. AND WHAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. GOOD AFTERNOON WE WANT TO BEGIN THE ASSEMBLY. COMMITTEE ON COMMUNICATIONS AND CONVEYANCE. VIA SUBCOMMITTEE BECAUSE WE HAVE NOTICED THE ABSENCE OF A QUORUM. SO. LET'S GO AHEAD AND BEGIN THIS WHERE. AND. UP BUT ALSO WANT TO MENTION THAT MISTER RODRIGUEZ WILL BE ABSENT TODAY. FOR THIS HEARING. I'M SUPPORT WOULD YOU BEGIN WITH TWENTY SIX FIFTY TWO. SURE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED ON PAGE SIX OF THE ANALYSIS. AB TWENTY SIX FIFTY TO SEEK TO SEEK TO IMPROVE THE ADMINISTRATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFELINE PROGRAM. THERE ARE PROBLEMS IN ADMINISTRATION WE THINK THAT. THIS BILL WILL SOLVE THEM ARE I'LL LET MY WITNESSES CONTINUE WITH THE TESTIMONY SO I CAN CONTINUE TO SAVE MY FOR HIS. THANK YOU WILL GO TO WITNESSES AND SUPPORT. VERY GOOD UP MY NAME IS FELIPE IF WENT AS I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL LIFELINE ASSOCIATION AND A JOINED. TODAY BY MATTHEW JOHNSON FROM CHIU CONNECT AS WELL AS MAKING COOK WITH THE NATIONAL LIFELINE ASSOCIATION SHE IS OUR GENERAL COUNSEL. HERE FOR ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS BUT BILL. ATTEMPTS TO DO A COUPLE OF THINGS. AS THE AUTHOR MENTION IT INTENDS TO MODERNIZE THE LIFELINE PROGRAM BY LOOKING AT PORTABILITY FREEZE IN FIGURING OUT HOW TO ADD SOME CERTAINTY. TO THE PROGRAM SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE WITH INEFFICIENCY IN THE WASTE THAT WE CURRENTLY SEE IN THE PROGRAM AND. MATTHEW CAN SPEAK AN AWFUL LOT MORE TO THAT IN A SECOND IN ADDITION THE BILL TRIES TO MODERNIZE THE PROGRAM BY MAKING IT SO THAT WE CAN HAVE MORE WEB ENROLLMENT OPPORTUNITIES. RATHER THAN HAVING A OF A WHAT SIGNATURE WE WOULD BE ABLE TO ACCEPT A ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE AS WELL AS LOOK AT THE RECERTIFICATION PROCESS AND UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN UNDERSTAND THAT EXPAND THAT. IN A WAY THAT'S MEANINGFUL THAT WILL BENEFIT THE SUBSCRIBER AND PROVIDE CERTAINTY FOR THE PROVIDERS AND WITH THAT BUT MISTER JOHNSON COULD SPEAK A LITTLE MORE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PORTABILITY FREEZE. I OUTSIDE THANK YOU MY NAME IS MATTHEW JOHNSON I'M CO CEO AND CO OWNER OF CHIU CONNECTS LARA LOS ANGELES BASED. COMPANY. IN WEAVING ONLY ACTUALLY CALIFORNIA BATES DTC. AND ALL OF CALIFORNIA THE REST OF THE. COMPETITORS IN THIS MARKET ALL FROM OUT OF STATE. US WHO WE ARE OF HEADQUARTERED LOS ANGELES WE EMPLOY. ABOUT SIXTY TO SEVENTY CALIFORNIANS AND LOS ANGELES AND THROUGHOUT OTHER PARTS IN OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE. DELEGATIONS ARE LOOKING EXPENDITURE RETTELLE OCCASIONS OFFERING BOTH. THE WHILE AND SUBSIDIZE SERVICES WELL AS PREPAID. SO IT'S A LITTLE BACKGROUND ON THE COMPANY. NOW GOODNESS FIX FACILITA PORTABILITY FREEZE. SO OBVIOUSLY WE SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME ACTION HAVE IDENTICAL TWIN BROTHER WHO WAS HERE TESTIFYING BEFORE WHICH MAY BE A LITTLE BIT. DISCERNING AS SOME OF YOU. THAT WHEN WE DID THIS LAST YEAR WENT THROUGH A GREAT. DEAL OF PROCESS AN EFFORT TO GET A BILL PASSED TO ENFORCE SUPPORT FREEZE. REPORT FREEZE IS OF AND NOT ABOUT LIMITING ACCESS TO THE PROGRAM SUPPORT FREEZE IT SPECIFICALLY TO. ADDRESS THE REAL ISSUE OF WASTE FRAUD ABUSE IN THE PROGRAM IS A CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA. IT BILLY OF A CUSTOMER TO LEAVE YOU THE DAY AFTER THEY SIGNED UP WITH THEO. IS IN NO WAY A WAY TO PROMOTE. ACCESS TO THE PROGRAM IT REALLY JUST WASTES MONEY BOTH FOR US IS A CARRIER. BUT ALSO FOR THE FUN AYE AS ITS PAYMENT TEN BY THE P. YOU SEE SO WE ARE. HERE VERY MUCH AND AGAIN THROUGH LIKE WE HAVE TO RE SELL THIS ISSUE AGAIN AFTER WE. HAVE THE PORTABILITY FREEZE IN PLACE FOR ONLY ABOUT NINE MONTHS AND NOW VERY SUDDENLY THE POOR VOTE FREEZES OVERTURNED ABOUT TWO OR THREE WEEKS AGO. SO IT'S IS A MAJOR ISSUE FOR US THE BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA. IT DOES NOT LIMIT ACCESS TO THE PROGRAM SERVICE TO THAT OF THOSE NOT CHALLENGE INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED THIS SERVICE. ODD SO I'M HERE TO SEE SPEAKING VERY MUCH ON BEHALF OF THIS EFFORT IN GETTING IT REINSTATED. OBVIOUSLY MAKES NO SENSE TO US AS TO WHY THIS WAS OVERTURNED. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. YES UP BY MAKING COOK WITH THE NATIONAL LIFELINE ASSOCIATION ARE ALSO KNOWN AS NALA. AND WE SUPPORT. THE. THE BILL. PRIMARILY FOR. A NUMBER OF REASONS INCLUDING THAT IT'LL HELP INCREASE SELF ROBUST SERVICE OFFERINGS BECAUSE WHEN CONSUMER STAY WITH THEIR PROVIDERS OF THE PROVIDERS CAN INVEST IN THE PROGRAM INVEST IN THE DEVICES. AND REALLY. PROVIDE GREATER. OPTIONS FOR FOR THE CONSUMERS AND ALSO REDUCE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS BECAUSE WHEN CONSUMERS MOVE FROM PROVIDER PROVIDER. EVERYTIME THEY TO THAT THE. THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR HAS TO. IN DEPEND TO DATABASES TO. CONFIRM ELIGIBILITY FOR THE SUBSCRIBER SO THAT INCREASES THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FOR THE PROGRAM. AND THEN ALSO A WE SUPPORT IT BECAUSE OF A PROPER MOAT PROGRAM INTEGRITY AND GUARD AGAINST. THE WE ARE PERENNIAL WASTE FRAUD IN THE PRE ABUSE AND THE WAY THAT A LITTLE TOO THAT IS BY. AS MATTHEW HAD MENTIONED THIS IDEA OF SERIAL FLIPPING WHERE A CONSUMER CAN GO TO ONE CARRIER AND THEN THE NEXT DAY OR A FEW DAYS LATER. GO TO ANOTHER CARRIER AND. YET ONLY ONE CAN CLAIM THAT. CONSUMER FOR. FOR THE SERVICE HOWEVER VICIOUS CREATES A LOT OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN AND WITH THE SERIAL FLIPPING IT CREATES OF FRAUD. BID IT ACTUALLY ENCOURAGES FRAUD AND YOU WANT TO SAY WHY PEOPLE FLIP. WELL I THE THE REASON THEY DO THAT IS BECAUSE THE A THE OPPORTUNITY IS IS THERE JUST IF I MIGHT I'D BE HAPPY TO SPEAK FOR THAT YEAH YEAH. I THINK WE HAVE IS SPEAK THAT. AGAIN IT'S I THINK HUMAN NATURE WHEN HE GOT OPPORTUNITY TO. GET SOMETHING FOR FREE AND SOMEONE SAYS YOU CAN GET THAT SERVICE FOR FREE THE NEXT DAY AGAIN. THERE IS THAT OPPORTUNITY THAT INDIVIDUAL TO GET REPEATEDLY IN A GIVEN MONTH WEEKDAY. REPEATEDLY AND GET THAT SERVICE REINSTITUTED AND ACTUALLY IN SOME CASES GET A FREE DEVICE OR DISCOUNTED DEVICE. OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER. THOSE DEVICES EVENT TURNED OUT IS BECAUSE FOR SOMETIMES RESOLD. ARE ON THEIR OWN SO THINGS LIKE THAT'S IT SHOULD NOT BE HAPPY WITH THIS PROGRAM IT'S IT'S COMMON SENSE THAT. IF YOU'RE PROVISION ITS SERVICE WHERE A COMPANY LIKE MINE IS INVESTING IN PROVIDING A SERVICE THIS CUSTOMER. THAT M. LEAVE THE NEXT DAY AYE WE INSTANTLY LOSE MONEY ON A CUSTOMER DAY ONE WHICH DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE AND IT STARTS THE PROGRAM. AND THEN THE FUN GETS DAMAGED BECAUSE. THESE INDIVIDUALS WILL MOVE FROM THIS FROM ONE SOURCE PROVIDED TO THE NEXT. AND IN TURN BY DOING SO OR BASIE RUNNING UP THE SOME COSTS TO THE PC FUND. BY CREATING A REIMBURSEMENT PACKED THAT CARRIER. SO THIS IS NOT SOMETHING WE PROMOTE IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE WANT TO SEE HAPPEN AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT. BE WHEN THE POOR FREEZE WHAT'S IN EFFECT FOR ABOUT NINE MONTHS IT WAS VERY EFFECTIVE. OUR OVERALL CHURN DROPS FROM SHARON MEANS THE NUMBER BECAUSE THAT LEAVE US ANY GIVEN MONTH. DROPPED ABOUT THIRTY THREE PERCENT IN A SPAN OF ABOUT. THE SEVEN MONTHS. AND WE'VE ALREADY SEEN IT INCREASED BY ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT LAST THIRTY DAYS. JUST FROM THE OVERTURNING OF THE SPORT FREEZE. IT DOESN'T BENEFIT THE FUND IT DOESN'T LIMIT THE ABILITY TO GET THE SERVICE AND IT JUST HURTS CARRIED LIKE US WHO ARE HERE. AND POINT CALIFORNIANS INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU I JUMP AHEAD EARLIER SLIMMING NOW ASK FOR ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESS IS NOT POSITION. THE. GOOD AFTERNOON THIS CHAIR MEMBERS OF NOTS HERNANDEZ AYE BEHALF THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK A WE DO HAVE AN OPPOSING THIS AMENDED POSITION. ON JUST VERY BRIEFLY ONE I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR CONDUCT ONGOING COMMUNICATION AND WITH BOTH HIM AND HIS STAFF. ON THIS ISSUE AND AS OTHER BILLS AS ALWAYS WE ALWAYS. A VERY PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS TURNS POSITION HAS BEEN. THAT THE IMPORT FREE SHOULD BE FOUND VERY LIMITED AND WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THIS BILL WOULD OPEN IT UP NOT JUST A CITY BUT BEYOND SIXTY DAYS AND WHAT WE HAVE FOUND. IN THE WORK WE'VE DONE WITH CONSUMERS AND ALSO IN. A THE PROCEEDINGS BUT BOTH AT THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IS THAT. APART FREEZE THAT IS TOO LONG IS ACTUALLY DETRIMENTAL TO CONSUMERS AND EVEN THOUGH YOU HEARD EXAMPLES. OF FRAUD IN IN ABUSE WE UNDERSTAND THAT THAT CAN CAN OCCUR IN THE SHOULD BE WAY SUGGEST THAT. HOWEVER THE OTHER EVIDENCE THAT WAS PROVIDED TO. BOTH FEDERALLY AND STATE LEVEL ON ON THIS ISSUE SHOW THE CONSUMERS BENEFIT WHEN THEY HAVE THE THAT OPTION THE FREEDOM TO MOVE TO VARIOUS CARRIERS THAT IS ACTUALLY VERY IMPORTANT. FOR CONSUMERS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THAT THE THAT THE FREEZE WAS ELIMINATED. ANYTHING BEYOND SIXTY DAYS WE THINK IS VERY PROBLEMATIC I THINK WE HAD DISCUSSIONS LAST YEAR WENT. ON A ARE YOU BEFORE MR QUIRK HAD A BILL ARE ON SIXTY DAYS AND SO WE TRIED TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT ON THAT. ABOUT THIS THEN OPENS OPENS UP AGAIN WE THINK JUST THAT A CONSUMER ISSUES AND CONSUMER PROTECTION IS BETTER. IF THERE'S NOT A FREEZE THAT IS GOING TO BE THAT LONG SO FOR THOSE REASONS WERE POSING AS A MEDIC. IT THERE'S HEAVY AT LEAST SIXTY DAYS BUT. I THINK THAT'S HOW WE READ IT PROVOCATIVE THANK YOU CAN AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE BRENDA PALOMINO HERE WITH SPRINT. ON BEHALF OF OUR LIFELINE. SUBSIDIARY INSURANCE WHY LET'S. WE DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THIS BILL WE HAVE CONCERNS WHICH WE'VE ARTICULATED TO THE AUTHORED WE WORKING WITH HIS OFFICE. WE DO APPRECIATE AND THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THE AMENDED SAY HE'S GOING TO BE TAKING. TODAY. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE ARE CERTAINLY A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IN TERMS OF ALLEVIATING SOME OF THE CONCERNS WE HAD. THE CONCERNS HOWEVER THAT REMAIN ARE WITH THE PROVISIONS THAT WOULD CREATE INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL PROGRAM. ASSURANCE WIRELESS BELIEVES THAT TO HAPPEN. AND EFFECTIVELY LIFELINE PROGRAM IS ONE THAT'S CONSISTENT. AT BOTH LEVELS I'M FOR PURPOSES OF EFFICIENCY I'VE FOR PURPOSES OF OF REDUCING ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND ALSO FOR SIMPLIFYING A LIFE LINE UP PARTICIPATION. WE I LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH US ON MEMBER QUIRK IN HIS OFFICE I'M IN HOPES THAT WE CAN ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE BUT. FOR PURPOSES OF TODAY NO OFFICIAL POSITION BUT WE DID WANT TO REGISTER OUR CONSULTANTS SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I GET ON THE PANTS AND REPRESENTED THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION RURAL TELEPHONE COMPANIES SERVING RURAL CALIFORNIA. BUT WE DO NOT HAVE AN OFFICIAL OPPOSE POSITION ON THIS BILL HOWEVER WE DO HAVE CONCERNS SOME. THAT WERE MENTIONED BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM SPRINT WE HAVE FOUND OUT THAT THERE IS THE POTENTIAL. THERE IS THE POTENTIAL OF LOSING NOT ALL BUT SOME OF THE FCC LIFELINE THAT WE RECEIVE. TO HELP LIFELINE CUSTOMERS WITH CALIFORNIA BEING OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE FCC THAT IS A CONCERN TO US. SO WE REMAIN CONCERNED. ALSO MANY OF OUR CUSTOMERS ARE TRYING TO COME BACK TO TO THEIR SERVICE THAT DOES PROVIDE LIFELINE. THROUGH THROUGH OUR COMPANIES AND THE SIXTY DAY FREEZE CUSTOMERS DON'T UNDERSTAND THEIR LIKE OKAY I JUST WANNA GO BACK TO THE WAY THINGS WERE AND THEY DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND THE PRE SO. PRO LOT OF CUSTOMERS IT AT THE DISADVANTAGE WE CONTINUE TO APPRECIATE THAT THE WORK WITH THE STAFF IN ASSEMBLYMAN QUIRKS OFFICE AND WE HOPE THAT WE CAN GET TO A POINT. OF OF BEING ABLE TO REMOVE OUR CONCERNS. ONE COMMET. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES OPPOSITION. ARE JACQUI CAN FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS AGAIN JUST. HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE BILL AND WILL WORK WITH THE AUTHOR TO. OF REMOVE THOSE CONCERNS AS THE DISCUSSION GOES FORWARD THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS BERNIE OROZCO WITH THE COMPANY CABLE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION NOT OPPOSE RIGHT NOW BUT WE ARE A IN COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE. AUTHOR AND SPONSORS HOPING TO ADDRESS SOME CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE. BUT TODAY JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WE EXPRESSED OUR CONCERNS PICKING. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THROW BUT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR DOCTOR QUIRK I I AM VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE PORTIONS OF YOUR BILL THAT INSTITUTE. THE PORTABILITY FREEZE AS WELL AS THE ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES I COULD TELL YOU I HAD A NUMBER OF A CASE FILED OPEN IN MY DISTRICT PEOPLE. THAT NOT BECAUSE OF THE WHAT THE UP REQUIREMENT TO DO WHAT SIGNATURE WERE HAVING DIFFICULTY RENEWING THEIR SERVICE AND WE HAD TO WALK THEM THROUGH AND. OTHERS WOULD MAKE IT MUCH EASIER FOR THEM SO BOB THANK YOU FOR INCLUDING THOSE PROVISIONS. I DO HAVE A CONCERN HOWEVER WITH THE PROVISION OF THE BILL THAT ESTABLISHES A NINETY PERCENT SUBSCRIPTION RATE FOR THE LIFELINE SERVICE AND LITTLE SURPRISED TO SEE THAT IN THERE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T SEEM TO FIT WITH THE THEME OF THE REST OF THE BILL. AND I WAS WONDERING BECAUSE I WOULD LOVE TO SUPPORT I WAS WONDERING IF YOU WOULD CONSIDER REMOVING THAT MOVING FORWARD. I'M I WILL CERTAINLY CONSIDER IT I CAN'T GUARANTEE IT TODAY I HAVE TO TO TALK WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS BUT I WOULD CERTAINLY CONSIDER IT. WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO. WANTED TO BE MORE THAN NINETY PERCENT. OF THAT THEY CHIEF THING FOR ME IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. OF WHETHER OR NOT HAVING A GOAL ABOVE FORTY PERCENT IS ACTUALLY REALISTIC AND WHAT IT WOULD COST. AND. PENDING THAT INVESTIGATION. I COULD WELL REMOVE IT I JUST I JUST NEED MORE TIME. CHUCK I UNDERSTAND I JUST WITH THAT PROVISION IS OBVIOUSLY ANOTHER BILLS GREEN AUTHORED THE SESSIONS SO. I THE REASON I BROUGHT IT UP IS THAT I WOULD LOVE TO SUPPORT THAT YOUR BILL AND I KNOW. MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES ON MY SIDE OF THE AISLE. WOULD ALSO LOVE TO SUPPORT IT THAT WE CANNOT SUPPORTED ABSENT A COMMITMENT TO REMOVE ITSELF UP YOU KNOW TODAY BUT I MEAN I I HOPE THAT YOU'LL CONSIDER REMOVING IT SO I CAN CHANGE THAT TO YES DEFINITELY CONSIDER IT MAKE AND JUST HAVE TO. TALK WITH EVERYONE INVOLVED. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I'M SCOTT WOULD LIKE CLOSE YES UP SO TURN. THEY'RE RIGHT IT DOES SAY AT LEAST SIXTY DAYS I WILL CERTAINLY LOOK AT CHANGING THAT TO JUST SIXTY DAYS. ARM. LET'S SEE I. IF YOU DON'T MIND ONE OF MY WITNESSES MATTHEW WANTED TO TALK TO ONE OF THE POINTS BROUGHT UP BY THE OPPOSITION. THAT THAT YOU TWO POINTS. NO ONE IS OBVIOUSLY I'M THERE FOR MOST OF OUR COMPETITORS IN THE ROOM. AYE WELCH'S SMALL BUSINESS. BASIN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA NOT SEE THE LACK OF PORT FEES FREEZES. A MAJOR ISSUE PROCESS A COMPANY BECAUSE IT CREATES A UNNECESSARY LOSSES FOR BUSINESS THAT LARGER COMPANIES CAN EASILY SUSTAIN. SO I FEEL LIKE SOME OF ADVICE THERE IS AN OBVIOUS YOU. MIGHT AFFECT US INSURANCE HA. DON'T DON'T INTERPRET OTHER PEOPLE'S MATLOCK HAD JUST SAY WHAT YOU'RE CONCERNED IT MIGHT CONCERN THERE'S ARTSY WITH THE PORT FREEZE IS THE ABILITY TAXI INVEST. INTO A BETTER OFFERING SERVICE FOR THE CUSTOMER. ON THAT ALLOWS US SECTION TO MAKE INVESTMENT IN CAPITAL TO ACQUIRE. A MORE VETS HANDSETS AND WE'RE VINCE TECHNOLOGIES ALLOW THE CUTS FROM A BETTER EXPERIENCE WHAT SAVED JOIN THE SERVICE WITH THOUGHTS. I WITHOUT A PORT VISIT MAKES IN ITS UNITS RECENTLY WERE. A LOT A CARRIAGE ARE PULLING BACK ON QUALITY PRODUCT OFFERING THE CONSUMER. BECAUSE THEY CAN'T TAKE THE RISK THE CONSUMER WILL BE THE NEXT DAY. THE OTHER POINT THAT HASN'T REALLY BEEN TALK ABOUT A LOT IN THIS. HEARING IS. REALLY WILL IT'S SPECIFIC TO THE RECERTIFICATION PROCESS SON OF OF GOING TO THAT LATER CAN SPEAK THAT RIGHT NOW I'M THIS IS YOUR ONLY CHANCE PILOTS HAVE TO FIGURE AS MUCH. SO ARE ON THE RESERVE GETS INSIDE OBVIOUSLY RECERTIFICATION PROCESS OF THE PROCESS BY WHICH A WIFI CUSTOMER NEWS SERVICE AFTER ONE YEAR. OF ABSENCE TO CALIFORNIA THE RENEWAL RATE IS IS NOT GOOD. AT RUNS ABOUT THIRTY TO THIRTY FIVE PERCENT ANNUALLY. THAT IS ARE TYPICALLY OUR BEST CUSTOMERS THAT WE ARE MANY KISSES LOSING. AND THE RULES AROUND THAT ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO MANAGE IN SOME CASES WE CAN'T CONTACT THE CONSUMER. SEE DAYS BEFORE THEIR ABOUT THE LEAVE US WHICH MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE. ARMS WHO WERE TRYING TO REALLY PUSH THAT. THERE'S AN EASIER WAY FOR THESE CONSUMERS TO ROLL SERVICE FOR AN ADDITIONAL YEAR AND OBVIOUSLY IN ANOTHER BILLS BEING SUGGESTED EXTENDING RESURFACED IN A TWO YEARS. OUT TO MATT SIMILAR PROGRAMS EXISTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I THINK IT'S A VERY EASY EFFECTS AND WE'VE GOTTEN. POSITIVE FEEDBACK LOOP YOU SEE ONE OF TALK ABOUT THAT DIRECTLY. THAT IT'S SOMETHING IS WRITTEN ABOUT THAT'S BECAUSE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. THE RESURFACING LEVELS CLOSER TO A NINETEEN NINETY TWO PERCENT. SO CALIFORNIA BEING. THE HOME OF TECHNOLOGY I THINK WE COULD FIX THIS PRETTY EASILY. ARE. AND WILL ALSO LOOK AT. THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE CAN BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE FEDS I. I JUST DON'T KNOW THE DETAILS OF THAT NOW BUT I HAVE PEOPLE WORKING WITH ME YOU DO. SARAH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I THINK IT WAS COKE WHAT AT THIS BILL ON HOLD ABSENCE OF A QUORUM. MAKING. THANK YOU I'M. BUT WILL NOW TAKE UP ITEM NUMBER ONE. AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY SEVEN. MISS CREEL YOU MAY BEGIN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND MEMBERS THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT I PERCENT OF YOUR COMMITTEE SOME EXCITED. I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY SEVEN. A BILL THAT WOULD HELP PROVIDE BETTER REDUCE A COUGH SORRY. BETTER REDUCE COSTS CELL AND HOME PHONE SERVICES FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES. I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND TALKING AND THINKING THEM FOR WORKING WITH MY STAFF AND THE SPONSORS TO ENHANCE THIS BILL. LIFELINE AT THE PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION OR THE CPU SEEM. FOR OUR LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS IN CALIFORNIA THAT HELPS OFFSET THE COST OF THEIR HOME OR CELL PHONE BILLS. THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR MANY YEARS AND HAS UNDERGONE CHANGES TO KEEP UP WITH TECHNOLOGY AND MARKETPLACE DEVELOPMENTS. HOWEVER THERE'S STILL LAGGING RESIDENTIAL CONSUMER PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM WHEN COMPARED TO THE AMOUNT OF OUR RESIDENTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE. FOR LIFELINE. THE CPUC HAVE ATTEMPTED TO ADDRESS THE SHORTFALL BUT THE PROBLEM HAS PERSISTED. TO ADDRESS THIS AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY SEVEN ESTABLISHED ESTABLISHES THE LIFELINE OVERSIGHT BOARD OR OR THE EL EL OB TO ADVISE THE CPUC. ON THE EFFECTIVE DEVELOPMENT IMPLEMENTATION AND ADMINISTRATION OF THE LIFELINE PROGRAM. THE L. L. OB RESTRUCTURES AND CODIFIES AN EXISTING ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR LIFELINE. THIS WITH STRUCTURAL CLARIFY THE SCOPE OF THE DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE BOARD WHILE ENCOURAGING GREATER CONSUMER PARTICIPATION AND INPUT REGARDING. HOW LIFELINE IS RUN? BY GIVING CONSUMERS A GREATER VOICE THE L. L. OB WILL BE MORE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT IN UPHOLDING THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE BOARD TO ADVISE THE COMMISSION. ON THE PRACTICAL DEVELOPMENTAND OPERATION OF THIS LOW INCOME LANDLINE AND CELLPHONE PROGRAM. THIS WOULD STRAIN THE ABILITY OF THIS PROGRAM TO PROVIDE BETTER SERVICES TO A LARGER NUMBER. OF DESERVING LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY IS ON A MONTH THIS THE ORGANIZING DIRECTOR OF THE UTILITIES REFORM NETWORK OR INTENT OPENS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF IT CONCEALED SOMEWHAT THEY'LL COUNTY. AND GILBERT MARTINEZ ON BEHALF OF THE FISCAL INTERTRIBAL COUNCIL. AND I'M ASPER ADDITIONAL UP FOR THE WITNESS SUPPORT SPEAK NO I'M GONNA GO BACK TO. THE WAY I USUALLY IT HERE TO MEETING I WAS A LITTLE BIT LOOSE OUR BECAUSE MISTER COURT AT A. THROATY XIN COULD SPEAK SO I LET PEOPLE JUMP AROUND I WANNA MAKE SURE WE GO BACK TO. TO THE STRUCTURE AND. AND. ALCOHOL LIMIT TIME I KNOW I GIVE A LECTURE TYPE THIS BECAUSE MISTER CORPORATE BORN IN VANCITY WAS NOT ABLE. THANK YOU. SO WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO MINUTES. TWO MINUTES. TOTAL WILL GET FIVE. SITE. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU THIS IS MY NAME IS ON A MOMENT THIS AND ON THE ORGANIZING DIRECTOR AT TURN. AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY SEVEN SIX TWO RESTRUCTURING EXISTING COMMITTEE AND CLARIFY THE DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE BOARD. WITH A GROWING POPULATION OF ELIGIBLE RATE PAYERS IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY UPHOLD THE LIFELINE PROGRAM AND ENSURE A ROBUST PARTICIPATION ON THE BOARD. TO CARRY OUT THE GOALS OF THE PROGRAM WE ALSO ENVISION THAT THE LIFELINE PROGRAM WILL BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE BROADBAND ACCESS AS A LOW INCOME PROGRAM. MAKING IT MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER. ENSHRINING THIS POURED INTO STATUE WILL HELP ENSURE A SUCCESSFUL LIFE A SUCCESSFUL LIFE BY PROGRAM. AS A PAST MEMBER OF THE UNIVERSAL LIFELINE TELEPHONE SERVICE TRUST ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE I AND TO OTHERS OF THE THREE CBO ORGANIZATIONS RESIGNED FROM THE COMMITTEE. BECAUSE I FELT THAT PUBLIC INPUT. BY THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION WAS NOT TAKEN SERIOUSLY OR SUPPORTED UNDER THE CURRENT STRUCTURE. THIS BILL REPRESENTS A LONG OVERDUE UPDATE OF THE BODY TASKED WITH ADVISING THE COMMISSION ON THE AFFECT THE DEVELOPMENT IMPLEMENTATION AND ADMINISTRATION OF THE CALIFORNIA LIFELINE PROGRAM. EIGHT A AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY SEVEN WOULD STRENGTHEN THE ROLE OF THE ADVISORY BOARD. THROUGH THAT THE RESTRUCTURING AND CLARIFYING OF THE DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE BOARD. THEY WOULD RECRUIT ACTIVELY MEMBERS TO FILL VACANT SEATS WHICH HAVE REMAINED VACANT SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN TOOK OR AS FAR AS TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN. IT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THE COORDINATION OF OTHER CALIFORNIA PUBLIC PURPOSE PROGRAMS. EXPAND OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUTREACH AND EDUCATION ABOUT THE PROGRAM THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALLOWING US TO SHARE OUR THOUGHTS ON THOSE. I TWO SERVED OF THE UNIVERSA LIFE BLANK OF TELEPHONE SERVICES TRUST ADMINISTRATIVE BOARD. AND JUST FELT THAT AT THE TIME THE WAY WE STRUCTURE WERE NOT ADDRESSING SOME OF THE ISSUES. I ALSO HAVE SERVED FIFTEEN YEARS JUST ROLLED OFF THE. OF CPUC LOW INCOME OVERSIGHT BOARD WHERE WE DO SEE HAVE SIMILAR OF ITS POSSIBILITIES AND WE DO SEE THE IMPACT IT HAS TO HAVE. THE BROAD BASE OF ALL STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE IMPACTED OR AFFECTED BY IT. AND. THEREFORE THAT HISTORY MAKES A DIFFERENCE I THINK I WORK WITH AN ORGANIZATION CALLED ECLIPSE YOU KNOW SOME UNTIL CONNIE WOULD WORK DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES PRIMARILY LOW INCOME AND THEN LIMITED ENGLISH SPEAKING SENIORS. IMMIGRANTS RECENTLY RE ENTRY AND WE SEE THE IMPACT IT'S HAVING WHEN SOMEBODY'S NOT THERE TO BE THEIR VOICE SHARE THE THOUGHTS AND EXPERIENCES THAT THEY NEED ON THE GROUND. SO I THINK THIS BILL WOULD ADDRESS THIS CLARIFYING IT AND POWERING THIS BOARD. TO FOLLOW TO BE THE CONSCIOUS TO BE THE VOICE TO ENSURE THE COMMUNITIES. IN THE INPUT AND CONCERNS ARE ADDRESSED IN A TIMELY MANNER AND I SUPPORT THAT TWENTY THREE. FIFTH TWENTY FIVE THIRTY SEVEN. BUT NOW I'M HERE TO READ CHARLIE TOLEDO'S. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF SISKEL INTEREST INTERTRIBAL COUNCIL STATEMENT. OBSERVERS ARE FROM OUTSIDE I WAS APPOINTED TO THE LOW INCOME OVERSIGHT BOARD WHICH ADVISES THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION ON LOW INCOME ELECTRIC AND GAS CANISTER CUSTOMER ISSUES. AND SERVES AS A LIAISON FOR THE COMMISSION OF TO LOW INCOME BRACKET REPAIRS ARE REPRESENTATIVES. THE ALLEY WILL BE REPLACE THE CPC LOW INCOME ADVISORY BOARD AND TWO THOUSAND ONE HAS WORKED THE CPUC TO IMPROVE ENROLLMENT. PROVIDE POLICY AND OTHER INPUT TO THE CPC FROM PERSPECTIVE OF THE LOW INCOME COMMUNITY AND PROVIDE CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION FOR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. AND I'LL I'LL BE WORK FOR THE CPC TO EVALUATE IMPLEMENTATION OF PROGRAMS PROVIDED TO LOW INCOME ATROCITY. AND GAS CUSTOMERS. AND HOPE TO INCREASE THE PROGRAM PENETRATION RETHINK CARRY OUT THE GOALS OF THE PROGRAM. THIS IS A SUCCESSFUL MODEL BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY SEVEN EMULATE. IN NOT HERNANDEZ A BEHALF ALSO BE HAVE TURNED AND SUPPORT JUST AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. I GUESS MATTHEW JOHNSON AGAIN FROM MUCH YOU CONNECTS WE'RE SUPPORTER OF THIS BILL. VINCENT LAY WITH THE GREEN LINING INSTITUTE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. I'M MORE SHEILA WHICH ISN'T WHAT AARP AND WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY SEVEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY WITNESSES OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. FOR ARE THANK MISTER CHAIR YOU KNOW. A LIFELINE SERVICE IS FUNDED BY A SURCHARGE ON. A TELEPHONE BILLS IN CALIFORNIA SO I'M WONDERING GIVEN THE CURRENT PARTICIPATION RATE IN THE CURRENT SURCHARGE. THAT IF YOUR BILL WERE TO BE ENACTED AND AND IF YOU WERE TO REACH THE GOAL OF NINETY PERCENT PARTICIPATION. WHAT WOULD THE SURCHARGE BE THAN TO BE ABLE TO FUND THAT PROGRAM? THAT'S THAT THAT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION I THINK THAT WE PROBABLY SHARE THE SAME CONCERNS AND THAT WE WOULD NOT WANT SURCHARGE MYSTICAL UP. WE WOULD LIKE HOWEVER TO ENSURE THAT LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND SENIORS I KNOW THAT I'VE WALKED MY NEIGHBORHOOD AND KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY SENIORS WHO. LET ALONE. THAT. DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO BE ABLE TO PAY FOR INTERNET OR PHONE SERVICES ARE MUCH LESS CELLPHONE SERVICES AND DON'T KNOW HOW TO ACTUALLY USE THAT. A SMARTPHONE. SO AND WE DON'T WANT THEM TO BE ALONE SO WE WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS ENSURE THAT THESE COMMUNITIES HAVE ACCESS TO BE ABLE TO REACH AND. NO CALL FOR AN EMERGENCY. AND THAT IS THE THAT IS THE INTENT SO I WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH YOUR OFFICE AND SEE IF THERE'S A WAY THAT WE CAN COME UP WITH A SOLUTION TO THAT. IF THAT WERE TO BE THE CASE OKAY WELL THANK YOU ARE A WITCH SHARE THE SAME CONCERN MEAN OBVIOUSLY WITH ANY KIND OF STATE PROGRAM WE HAVE TO BALANCE THE BENEFITS THAT WERE PROVIDING AGAINST. THE COSTS TO OUR CONSTITUENTS AND WE SEEK A BALANCE THERE. ARE I'M AFRAID HOWEVER THAT IF WE WERE TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF NINETY PERCENT PARTICIPATION THE SURCHARGE ON EVERYONE'S PHONE BILL WOULD BE SO HIGH THAT THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS WOULD NOT AGREE. WITH THE DECISION TO ESTABLISH THAT AS AS A WHOLE. I WON A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF YOUR BILL GOES TO PAY THE BILL OF OTHER PEOPLE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CERTAINLY MY CONSTITUENTS WOULD HAVE A PROBLEM WITH AND THAT'S WHY I HAVE TO. RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL TODAY. YES THANK YOU FOR THAT TURN IS ALWAYS CONCERNED ABOUT RAISING RATES WELL YOU USE USUALLY BE IF THERE'S A QUESTION ASKED TO THEN YOU RESPOND. JUST TO KEEP ORDER. AS ANY OF THE I WOULD BE FASCINATED TO HEAR YOUR FOR YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS. THANK YOU. TURN IS ALWAYS CONCERNED WHENEVER THERE IS A REQUEST FOR A RATE INCREASE. AND SO. SO WE CERTAINLY ECHO ECHO YOUR SERVICE SENTIMENT THAT WE DON'T WANT TO SEE. OUR RATEPAYERS BURDENED WITH WITH ADDITIONAL INCREASES THERE IS AN EXTENSIVE PROCESS THAT THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION GOES THROUGH AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO IS WE ACTUALLY BRING CONSUMERS TO THE TABLE TO BE ABLE TO OFFER THEIR OPINION. ON HOW IN IMPACT HOW INCREASE WOULD IMPACT THEM SO GETTING THEIR RESPONSES IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT. OP SO THAT IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WOULD SERIOUSLY BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION AS WELL. WELL I APPRECIATE THAT YOU KNOW THE MISTER OF LIMON MIPS DOUBLE CHECK IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE WAS QUESTIONS. ALL THIS CRAP. UP AHEAD OF A BOOK THE THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE IS JUST MY BACK OF THE ENVELOPE MATH. INDICATES THAT IF WE WERE TO SUCCEED IN GETTING A NINETY PERCENT. THAT THAT WAS SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE THE SURCHARGE ON OTHER PEOPLE'S TELEPHONE BILLS AND IT IT'S AN INEVITABLE MATHEMATICAL CONSEQUENCE OF. OF ACHIEVING THAT GOAL AND I DON'T THINK THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS WOULD BE OKAY WITH THE AMOUNT OF SURCHARGE THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED. TO SERVICE THAT GONE THAT'S WHY AFTER RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR BEEN. I NEED TO SHOW QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MISCREANT WOULD LIKE CLOSE. THANK YOU I. I WOULD JUST SAY THAT. WE ARE NOT WE'RE CURRENTLY THE WAY THAT THE PROGRAM IS STRUCTURED NOT MEETING. THE GOALS THAT THE THAT IS THE INTENT BEHIND THIS LIFELINE PROGRAM SO MAYBE THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE IT. AND TO YOUR POINT ABOUT CALIFORNIANS NOT WANTING TO SUPPORT SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA INCREASE SURCHARGE LIKE I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND. BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA'S VALUES ALSO ENSURE THAT SENIORS. AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES LOW INCOME FAMILIES. THEY'RE IT THEY'RE NOT ALONE ESPECIALLY THE SENIOR POPULATION WHO. OFTEN DOES NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES ARE LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK SOURCE SECURITY. TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD WHAT. TRADITIONALLY WOULD BE PAID AND SO I THINK THAT CALIFORNIA VALUES WERE ALSO SUPPORT. ENSURING THAT SENIORS HAVE THOSE RESOURCES WHICH IS WHERE WE WANT TO GET. SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. I KNOW TO MR LOW IS IN THE BACK SO WE'LL GO AHEAD AND ESTABLISH CORMACK EXISTE PUT PER SECOND. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SANTIAGO. I HEAR. OBERNOLTE HERE. BONTA. CERVANTES.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN PERCENT LIKE TO START BY THANKING THE CHAIR AND HIS. COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING DILIGENTLY ON THIS BILL AND AND HELPING CRAFT SOMETHING THAT'S I THINK CAN BE A POSITIVE THING. DISTORT THE THIS BILL COMES WITH A LITTLE BIT OF A STORY AND I'LL TRY TO BE VERY QUICK BUT IF YOU'LL INDULGE ME. EARLIER THIS YEAR THE SENATE SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY MY HOME COUNTIES. A DISTRICT ATTORNEY FILED TEN CHARGES AGAINST AN INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS A LOCAL. TNC DRIVER. HE WAS UTILIZING AN ABUSING THE APP. WHAT HE WOULD DO IS ALLEGEDLY IS? ESSENTIALLY WERE VICTIMS INTO THE. INTO HIS CAR BY SHOWING UP IN PRESENTING HIMSELF AS IF HE WAS. THEY'RE. DRIVER. AND. HE WAS TARGETING WOMEN THAT WERE LEAVING. PARTIES AND SUCH IT AT CAL POLY LOCAL UNIVERSITY. THAT THE VICTIMS RAGED IN AGE FROM NINETEEN TO TWENTY TWO. HE ALLEGEDLY COMMITTED. BURGLARY HE TAKE THEM HOME ENTER THEIR DWELLING COMMITTED COMMIT BURGLARY COMMIT A RAPE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT. AND. CURRENT COUNTERS FOR VICTIMS. THERE MAYBE MORE. IN LOS ANGELES IT'S BEEN REPORTED THAT THERE. ARE OTHER SIMILAR CASES WHERE PEOPLE. ARE POSING TO BE THE PERSONS TNC DRIVER. AND AT. COMMITTING HORRIBLE ATROCITIES. I BELIEVE THAT THESE EVENTS AT THE Q. WONDERFULLY AND INDIVIDUALLY IT. SHAKEN SOME TRUST AND WHAT MY BILL SEEKS TO DO IS IS RESTORE THAT TRUST AND. RIDE SHARING SERVICES WHICH I I SHOULD NOTE FOR THE RECORD I I USE THEM MYSELF. AND I THINK THEY ARE POSITIVE THING AND THEY'RE HAVING POSITIVE EFFECTS JUST. TO GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE FOR THE POSITIVE EFFECT ON PUBLIC SAFETY AND A LOT OF COUNTIES WERE. TNC AT NETWORKS OPERATE. YOU'VE SEEN DRAMATIC DECLINES IN THE AND THE RATE OF A DO YOU LIVE DRUNK DRIVING. SO I THINK THERE'S TREMENDOUS BENEFIT THESE SERVICES. I WHAT THIS BILL SEEKS TO DO IS CODIFYING STATE LAW SOMETHING THAT YOU SEE IS REQUIRING CURRENTLY BY REGULATION. A BUT THAT REGULATION AS YOU ALL KNOW COULD BE CHANGED WITH A SIMPLE THREE VOTE. THREE VOTES OF THE FIVE OF THE COMMITTEE COMMISSION ANYTIME. AND WHAT THAT REQUIREMENT IS THAT THE RIDESHARE APPS TO INFORM THE PASSENGERS SLASH CUSTOMER. THAT THE FIRST NAME OF THE DRIVER. A HAVE A PICTURE OF THE DRIVER. SO THEY CAN BE. NAME IDENTIFICATION VISUAL IDENTIFICATION OF THE DRIVERS APPEARANCE. AN IMAGE OF THE MAKE AND MODEL OF THE VEHICLE. THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE GETTING IN. AND FINALLY THE LICENSE PLATE NUMBER TO IDENTIFY THE VEHICLE. AGAIN IT'S ALREADY BEING DONE BY REGULATION THAT SEEKS TO CODIFY IT SO IT CAN'T BE CHANGED IN LAW. AND. I I RECOGNIZE THAT. THERE IS AND THE CHAIR I'VE HAD NUMEROUS DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND. OF IT IT'S A TRICKY THING A BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT NO LAW CAN PREVENT EVERY TRAGEDY NO LAWS GONNA. KEEP PEOPLE FROM DOING PREDATORY OF THINGS. BUT I I THINK THIS IS A A MODEST STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION OF PROVIDING. A RESTORED TRUST IN A BASELINE. A PUBLIC SAFETY SO THAT. PEOPLE PARTICULARLY AND. YEAH YOUNG COLLEGE WOMEN THAT ARE USING THE SERVICES CAN. PAN. HAVE ADDITIONAL SAFETY FEATURES THEY CAN RELY ON TO BE ABLE TO USE THESE SERVICES IN A. IN A POSITIVE WAY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. SURE I KNOW SOME OF THE WITNESSES MAY HAVE WANTED TO COME UP THE AND IF YOU WANTED TO DO THAT NOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO SORT OF. BUT A ADDITIONAL TIGHT WITNESSES SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS LARA BUT WITH TECH NET MY APOLOGIES FOR NOT HAVING A LETTER ON FILE IN THE ANALYSIS WE ARE PREVIOUSLY OPPOSED TO THEM. VERSION IMPRINTS ON INDUCTION WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE AUTHOR OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE REMOVE THE OPPOSITION AND NOW SUPPORT BILL MOVING FORWARD THANK YOU.

THREE ONE ONE ONE. A WIRELESS LIKE MINE SERVICE IS A VITAL. SERVICE FOR LOW INCOME AND UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS IN CALIFORNIA IT IS ESTIMATED THAT ONLY THIRTY FOUR PERCENT OF THOSE ELIGIBLE. S. WIRELESS SERVICE ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM. UNDER EXISTING LAW. IT'S CRITICAL SERVICES LIMITED TO ONE SUBSCRIBER PER PLACE OF RESIDENCE. THE REENTRY POPULATION OFTENTIMES PARTICIPATES IN SHARED HOUSING AS THEY TRANSITION FROM PRESENT TO CAREER MAKING THE SERVICE UNAVAILABLE TO THEM. ADDITIONALLY THE FORMERLY INCARCERATED POPULATION OFTEN DOES NOT HAVE A VALID ID. TO QUALIFY FOR MY PLANE SERVICES DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY WERE PREVIOUSLY WARDS OF THE STATE. AB THREE ONE ONE ONE ADDRESSES THE LIFELINE PROGRAM DEFICIENCIES RESULTING IN LOW PARTICIPATION BY ALLOWING MULTIPLE LIKE MINE. TELEPHONE SERVICES GRABBERS TO MAINTAIN SAFE. THE SAME PRINCIPLE PLACE A RESIDENCY. RESPECT AS FOR I WILL. BUT WHEN THIS IS A PART. YES WE SUPPORT THIS BILL AS WELL. AND MR GARCIA. DIE HERE THAT YOU ACCEPT THE AMENDED YES WE ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND WE HAVE A A FIRST. AND WE WOULD NEED A SECOND. THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THAT LED WITH THE GREEN LINING INSTITUTE HERE IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MR O.. EXPOSURE CHAIR SO I LIFTING THE ONE. SERVICE PER HOUSEHOLD RULE BUT OBVIOUSLY BE A SUBSTANTIAL EXPANSION OF THE PROGRAM. BUT HOW MANY ADDITIONAL HOUSEHOLDS AS A PERCENTAGE OF THOSE CURRENTLY ENROLLED YOU THINK THIS WOULD ADD. AND WHAT IMPACT DO YOU THINK THAT THAT WOULD HAVE ON. THE TELEPHONE BILLS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE NOT RULED. LOOK IT'S MINOR SENATE CAN SPEAK WITHOUT US IN OUR EFFORTS TO TRY TO SERVICE POPULATION. GIVEN THAT THE LARGE PART OF PUBLIC TO QUALIFY THE SOURCES FROM THE UNDERSERVED AT CURRENT LEVELS. OUR VIEWS THIS POPULATION IS NOT THAT LARGE IT WOULD SIGNIFICANT INCREASE. THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF CONSUMERS GETTING SERVICE THROUGH WHAT FUND PROGRAM. SO IT'S A. ONE WAY OF SAN FROM UP IMPACT ON THE BUDGET OR INCREASING TAXES A LOT THAT WOULD AFFECT AT ALL. OKAY DOT I KNOW I I HAVE TO DISAGREE WITH THAT BECAUSE THE P. YOU SEE. REGULAR SETS THE SURCHARGE ON TELEPHONE BILLS. TO BE ABLE TO FUND THE PROGRAM BASED ON THE CURRENT DEMAND SO I THINK BY DEFINITION IF WE EXPAND THE NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLDS ARE ELIGIBLE. THAT EXPANDS THE PROGRAM IN THE FEW SEE WOULD HAVE TO RAISE A SURCHARGE SO WELL I DON'T. COULD SPEAK UP THAT'S WHEN ANOTHER THROUGH THE CHAIR OKAY I'M SORRY I DON'T START A BACK AND FORTH AND IT. IF YOU'D ASKED THE QUESTION YOU MAY RESPOND. AND I GUESS HE'S ASKING. THAT YOU YOU BELIEVE THAT THERE'S A SKIRT SURCHARGE ON THAT WOULD INCREASE. AND YOU WANTED THE ANSWER TO HOW YOU RECONCILE THAT WITH THE ANSWER OF NOT HAVING SURCHARGE INCREASE LET ME RESTATE SO I BELIEVE THAT. IF THE NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS IN THE PROGRAM. RISES AS A RESULT OF THIS LEGISLATION THE P. YOU SEEN WOULD HAVE NO CHOICE EXCEPT TO RAISE THE SURCHARGE BE ABLE TO FUND THE PROGRAM DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT. ACTION AT THIS YEAR AT THAT BECAUSE THESE SURCHARGE IS ALREADY INCREASED SEVERAL TIMES BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. AND THERE IS AT LEAST FROM OUR MEASURES FOR AN ADEQUATE BUDGET THE FUND. IT SUCKS MATCH THE PROGRAM NOT ONLY FOR. INCREASE ENROLLMENT BUT ALSO FOR INDIVIDUALS LIKE THAT'S WERE NOT SERVE NOW. OKAY WELL WHAT DEGREE TO DISAGREEMENT LAST YEAR THE P. YOU SEE DECREASED THE SURCHARGE BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF DEMAND SO MUCH THAT'S ONE OF MY BIG CONCERNS. ASSEMBLYMAN WITH THIS BILL IS THAT. I THINK THAT IT'S GOING TO INCREASE THE SURCHARGE ON CALIFORNIA'S TELEPHONES BILLS BUT NOT A KIND OF A BIGGER. PHILOSOPHICAL ISSUE WITH THE BILL WHICH IS THAT. THE. MORE UNIVERSAL TELEPHONE SERVICES ACT THAT ESTABLISHED LIFELINE PROGRAM BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TEN THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF THAT WAS NOT TO GIVE CALIFORNIANS SOMETHING THAT WE THOUGHT THEY SHOULD HAVE. IT WAS TO GIVE SOMETHING CALIFORNIANS THAT SOMETHING THAT WAS VITAL FOR THEM TO HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE BIGGEST. CONCERNS WAS THE ABILITY TO CALL NINE ONE ONE SOMEONE'S BREAKING YOUR HOUSE OR IF YOU HAVE A MEDICAL EMERGENCY BUT THAT WAS REALLY THE DRIVER WHEN THE LIFELINE PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED. AND THAT'S WHY THE ONE SUBSCRIBER PER HOUSEHOLD RULE WAS SET INTO PLACE SO I HAVE A BIG PROBLEM WITH CHANGING THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE PROGRAM. NO FROM SOMETHING THAT'S VITAL TO SOMETHING THAT WE JUST THINK PEOPLE OUGHT TO HAVE AND THAT'S WHY AFTER RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE IT. I MEAN WANT TO CLEAR THAT UP IN IN WHEN IT BEGAN IT WAS LANDLINES. AND SO THAT THERE WAS THAT. YOU THAT THAT IDEA THAT YOU ONLY PUT ONE LINE IN. YOU INCREASED THE CELLPHONES AND AND. THAT WAS THE VIEW THAT I TOOK AND SECOND OF YOU SOME OF THESE COMMUTERS REPRESENT YOU HAVE. OF WHAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER ONE TRADITIONAL FAMILY IN A HOME YOU HAVE SEVERAL FAMILIES IN A HOME. AND SO THAT WAS THE VIEW. IT'S ABOUT TWENTY CLEAR THAT THAT PIECE UP FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS.
