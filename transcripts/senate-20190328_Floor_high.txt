NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN SAYS SIZE LIVE WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY EXAMPLE OF HOW ONE PERSON CAN IMPACT ALL OF OUR LIVES. ON A PERSONAL NOTE. I WAS PICKING CROPS FROM THE DAY THAT I COULD WALK. ALL THE WAY THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL. NUMBER SEVEN IN A FAMILY OF ELEVEN WITH PERRANCE ALL WORKED AS MIGRANT FARMWORKER FAMILY. FROM THE LEXICAL TO OREGON. EVERYTHING FROM COTTON TO GRAPES TO PEACHES TO PAIR YOU NAME IT WE PICKED IT. AND I WAS ALWAYS AMAZED AT HOW MY FATHER WAS SO PROUD OF HIS WORK. AND EVEN LET US GET AWAY WITH DOING SHABBY WORK. AND I ALWAYS THOUGHT TO MYSELF. WHY IT'S JUST A PEACH IT'S JUST A OF A YOU KNOW A GREAT WHAT THE HECK IS THE MATTER WITH TAKING SOME SHORT CUTS? AND HE WAS VERY STRINGENT ABOUT DOING IT RIGHT HE LOVED. THE WORK YOU LOVE THE FEELS HE THOUGHT IT WAS A VERY VERY. EXTRAORDINARY THING FOR HIM TO DO THAT. I OF COURSE THOUGHT ABOUT HOW DO I GET OUT OF HERE. WHAT'S THE FASTEST WAY TO GET OUT OF WORKING IN THE FIELDS. BECAUSE OF THE HEAT. BECAUSE OF THE COLD. BECAUSE OF THE WORKING CONDITIONS WERE JUST THE WORST. AND WHEN SAYS ARE CHAVEZ AND THE FARMWORKERS MOVEMENT BEGAN I LEARNED. AND SET ASIDE VALIDATED MY FATHER AND OUR FAMILIES LOVE OF DOING THIS WORK. THE SIDE LIVED AND RESPONSE AND DEPENDED ON THE POWER OF SOLIDARITY BUT HE TAUGHT US THAT WE WERE WORTH MORE. THAN THE INSTRUMENTS OF THE WORK THAT WE DID THAT WE WERE HUMAN BEINGS AND WE DESERVE THE RESPECT FOR THIS HARD WORK. SO HE RELIED ON SOLIDARITY WHEN FARMWORKERS THEMSELVES WHEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY ASKING FOR SUPPORT. IN CITIES AND WAYS THAT THEY HAD NEVER KNOWN BEFORE THEY LEFT THEIR SMALL TOWNS AND THEY TRAVELED ALL THE WAY TO CANADA TO NEW YORK TO BOSTON. PLACES THEY HAD NEVER BEEN BEFORE AND EVERYWHERE THEY WENT NUNS AND PRIESTS AND UNION LEADERS AND ENVIRONMENTALISTS AND COMMUNITY LEADERS. REGULAR MOMS IN THE URBAN AREAS OPENED UP THEIR HOMES. AND JOIN THEM ON THE PICKET LINES. IN SEPTEMBER NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE SAYS SIDE LED A SUCCESSFUL FIVE YEAR STRIKE. AND BOYCOTT THAT RALLIED MILLIONS OF SUPPORTERS WHO THE UNITED FARM WORKERS HE FORGED THE NATIONAL COALITION OF UNIONS AND CHURCHES AND STUDENTS AND CONSUMERS. HE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE ONLY WAY FOR THE POOR AND EXPLOITED FARMWORKERS WITH TO HAVE AND CREATE THEIR OWN UNION. THE FIRST PROHIBITION OF A PESTICIDE IN THE FEELS TO PROTECT BOTH THE FARMWORKERS AND US AS CONSUMERS WAS THROUGH A UNION CONTRACT IT WAS A PROHIBITION OF DDT. THROUGH THE ACTS OF NON VIOLENCE BOYCOTT. AND STRIKES AND FAST HE EMPOWERED THE MOLDS VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN OUR STATE. A TODAY'S SISTERS AND BROTHERS THE ROLE OF FARMWORKERS IS JUST AS VITAL TO THE ECONOMY OF CALIFORNIA AS IT WAS WHEN SAYS SIDE AND THE FARMWORKERS BEGAN THE STRUGGLE. OUR FARMWORKERS FEED OUR STATE AND OUR NATION THROUGH THEIR HARD WORK THEY ARE THE BACKBONE OF THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY. ON BEHALF OF HIS LEGACY WE SEEK SO SHE'LL AND ECONOMIC EQUALITY TODAY [inaudible] TODAY. FOR FARMWORKERS FOR THEIR FAMILIES. THE SIDE CHAVEZ USED TO SAY WE CANNOT SEEK ACHIEVEMENT FOR OURSELVES AND FORGET ABOUT THE PROGRESS AND PROSPERITY FOR OUR COMMUNITY.

IN THE SHAPING OF HIS CHARACTER AND HIS VISION. THE MAN WITH A BURNING DESIRE. TO SERVE IN TO LEAD IN A SELFLESS MANNER. AND WHILE OPPONENTS WOULD ARGUE THAT HE WAS LIVING IN LUXURY UP IN THE PIES AND DRIVING GOLDING CADILLACS. I SAW HOW HE LIVED. I SAW HOW HE SACRIFICED. IN WE JOINED IN THE FAST. IN HIS THIRTY SIX DAY FAST OF WATER ONLY. TO BRING ATTENTION. TO THE DAMAGE BEING CAUSED BY PESTICIDES NOT JUST TO FARMWORKERS BUT IN RURAL AREAS. MANY FEEL THAT THIS FAST. LED TO HIS SHORTENED LIFESPAN BECAUSE OF DAMAGE TO HIS ORGANS THAT WAS YOUR REVERSIBLE -- BUT SAY SAID HIS BROTHER RICHARD DELORES. THE FOUNDERS OF THIS UNION. DID IT PERSON BY PERSON FIELD BY FIELD ANY LOOK AT THE POWER DISPARITY. HE ORGANIZED A GROUP OF IMMIGRANTS. MANY WITHOUT LEGAL STATUS IN THIS COUNTRY WORKING FOR MINIMUM WAGE OR LESS -- OFTEN MUCH OF THE PAYCHECK BEING DIVERTED TO PAY FOR SUBSTANDARD HOUSING. WATER FOOD -- BUILT AN ORGANIZATION.

THESE IMPORTANT SERVICES INCLUDE COPPERS CONTRACEPTIVE CARE PREGNANCY TESTING DIAGNOSING AND TREATING SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS. INFERTILITY SERVICES AND PREGNANCY OPTION COUNSELING. CLEARLY THESE ARE ALL CRITICAL SERVICES. EARLIER THIS MONTH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RELEASED NEW FUNDING REGULATIONS FOR TITLE. TEN THESE REGULATIONS THE NIGHT WOMEN INFORMATION ABOUT HEALTH CARE OPTIONS DISRUPT THE PROVIDER PATIENT RELATIONSHIP ENDED HER CALIFORNIANS FROM ACCESSING CARE. BY TYING FEDERAL FUNDING TO THESE RELATE REGULATIONS MANY HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATIONS AND QUALIFIED FAMILY PLANNING PROVIDERS IN CALIFORNIA WILL BE FORCED TO CHOOSE. BETWEEN A CRITICAL FUNDING SOURCE AND ACCEPTING REGULATIONS THAT WILL REDUCE ACCESS TO QUALITY TIME SENSITIVE CARE FOR LOW INCOME RESIDENTS. ACCORDING TO ESSENTIAL ACCESS HEALTH APPROXIMATELY ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS ARE SERVED BY TITLE TEN PROGRAMS ACCOUNTING 425% OF TOTAL TEN TEN PATIENTS NATIONWIDE. THIS MEANS THAT THE IMPACTS OF THESE NEW TITLE TEN REGULATIONS WILL BE FELT MOST INTENSELY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND CALIFORNIA WOMEN OF FAMILIES WILL BE THE ONES TO BEAR THE BRUNT OF THESE ACTIONS. THE REGULATIONS WOULD ALSO DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND REVERSE THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE IN REDUCING. UNINTENDED PREGNANCY RATES IN OUR STATE.

THESE PROVIDED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH THE WAY FINANCE OF NEEDED INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. WITH TAX INCREMENT FINANCING. THIS IS A USEFUL TOOL BUT IS YOUR UNDERUTILIZED. WE HAVE -- LOOKED INTO SOME OF THE BARRIERS TO USING THESE TOOLS -- AND EF ID'S REQUIRE A THE SENATE OFFICE OF RESEARCH -- THEY DID A REPORT ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FINANCING AND IDENTIFIED THIS IS ONE OF THE MAJOR BARRIERS -- FOR THIS PROGRAM. THE ELECTION REQUIREMENT ADDS AN ELEMENT OF UNCERTAINTY RESTRICTS THE ABILITY OF THE IRAQIS MAKING LONG TERM COMMITMENTS. OF THE LAW -- YES BE ONE TWENTY EIGHT REPLACES THE ELECTION. WITH PROTESTS PROCESS AND ENHANCES IT IN IS MODELED AFTER SB -- NINE SIXTY ONE BY THE CENTER FOR LOS ANGELES -- THE NIFTY TO BILL WHICH PASSED THE SENATE FLOOR LAST YEAR WITH THIRTY EIGHT VOTES. SO WE'RE MONITORING THE PROTEST -- THAT WE ENHANCE IN THIS BILL AFTER THE LAW WE PASSED LAST YEAR. LIKE NIFTY AYE APPEASING CREATORS COMMUNITY REINVEST COMMUNITY REDEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT. PROGRAMS. CHANGES THE TO THESE FINANCING DISTRICTS ARE NOT SUBJECT. TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL DEBT LIMIT AND THE TWO THIRDS VOTING REQUIREMENTS. THE PROPERTY TAXES ALLOCATED TO EACH OF THESE ARE NOT NEW TAXES. THESE -- I OF THE FIFTIES CANNOT AND DO NOT INCREASE TAXES ARE TAX RATES. THE E. I'VE THE LAW REQUIRES PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN THE GOVERNANCE. MANDATING THE BOARD OF OF THE PUBLIC FINANCING AUTHORITY INCLUDE PUBLIC MEMBERS. SB A ONE TWENTY EIGHT ALSO INCLUDES A ROBUST LANDOWNER RESIDENT PROTESTS PROCESS. CREATED BY OUR MEMBERS THAT WE PRODUCE IN MARCH. THE SP ONE TWENTY EIGHT PUBLIC PROCESS. OF MODELED AFTER -- NINE SIXTY ONE REQUIRES A ROBUST THREE STEP PROTESTS PROCESS -- THERE'S GOING TO BE THREE HEARINGS. THE HEARING COMMENT ON ALL PUBLIC COMMENTS -- TO CONSIDER THAT -- E. I. R. P. INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN. REQUIRES THE PUBLIC FINANCING AUTHORITY TERMINATE. THE E. IFT INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN IF THERE IS A MAJORITY PROTESTS. REQUIRES AN ELECTION OF BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE AND 50%. OF THE COMBINED NUMBER LANDERS AND RESIDENTS IN THE AREA. WHO ARE AT LEAST EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE PROFILE PROTEST? THE GOVERNOR TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS CLING TO BROWN AT OPEN MEETING LAW PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. AND POLITICAL REFORM ACT ALL APPLY. TO THESE -- HIGHER TONIGHT VOTE AND THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. A COLLEAGUES -- IT WOULD APPEAR THAT HE AYE EMPTIES AND HANSON PRINT INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICTS DO NOT REQUIRE A TWO THIRDS. VOTER APPROVAL THEREFORE SB ONE TWENTY EIGHT IS MINISTERIAL. AS THE 55% VOTER APPROVAL WAS PROBABLY ORIGINALLY INCLUDED IN THE ORIGINAL INCEPTION LANGUAGE. BUT THE LACK OF VOTER INVOLVEMENT. OTHER THAN ELECTING THEIR CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS. ADD TO HAVE -- IS ABOUT THE ONLY DIRECT WAY THAT THEY CAN GET INVOLVED IN APPROVING THE I'VE D. I. F. D.. BONDS CONSEQUENTLY THE PERCEIVED SAFEGUARD OF A 55% VOTER APPROVAL. WAS ACTUALLY ILLUSIONARY BUT I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL. THE SENATOR FROM SAN JOSE FOR FINDING ALTERNATIVES. TO ASSURE STRONGER FIDUCIARY STANDARDS FOR BOND ISSUANCE THROUGH HIS PROTEST PROCESS BUT I THINK WE SHOULD BE CAREFUL WHEN WE ADOPT PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW FOR THE ISSUANCE OF BONDS. THAT EXCLUDE THE VOTERS FROM BEING INVOLVED BECAUSE OUR STATE CONSTITUTION IS PRETTY CLEAR THAT WE SHOULD HAVE A TWO THIRDS INVOLVEMENT FOR ANY DEBT. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. THANK YOU MISTER MURDOCH. SEE NO FURTHER MIKE SAT -- CENTER BELL YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT SIR WATER -- IN TERMS OF THE LOG SPECIFICALLY THE BONDS -- FROM -- THE E. I. F. THESE ARE ONLY THE DEBT OF THE I. E. I. OF DE NOT CAESAR COUNTIES. AND THE BONDS NOT CONSTITUTE INDIAN DEAFNESS WITHIN THE MEANING OF ANY CONSTITUTIONAL. OR STATUTORY DEPTH LIMITATIONS SO. SO THAT'S WHY THE NORMAL PROCESSES THESE DO NOT REQUIRE A VOTE. I REGION I VOTE ON THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU SENATOR MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ALLEN. I ARCHULETA.

PRESS SECRETARY PLEASE READ SENATE BILL TWO TWENTY THREE BY SENATOR HILL AND ACTUALLY PEOPLE HEALTH. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT -- GOOD MORNING THIS BE TO TWENTY THREE JO JO'S ACT. WILL HELP STUDENTS WITH SEVERE MEDICAL DISABILITIES ATTEND SCHOOL. THE ONLY MEDICATION THAT WORKS FOR SOME OF THESE STUDENTS IS MEDICAL CANNABIS. THIS BILL WILL ALLOW A PARENT OR GUARDIAN TO COME ON CAMPUS TO ADMINISTER MEDICAL CANNABIS TO THEM IN NON SMOKING NON VAPING FORMS. MANY OF THE STUDENTS NEED TO TAKE A DOSE OF MEDICINAL CANNABIS AT REGULAR INTERVALS WHICH OFTEN INCLUDES DURING SCHOOL HOURS CURRENT LAW DOES NOT ALLOW ANY FORM OF CANNABIS ON SCHOOL GROUNDS. THE STUDENTS MUST BE PICKED UP BY THEIR PARENTS. AND TAKEN OFF CAMPUS A THOUSAND FEET TO FROM CAMPUS. IN ORDER TO TAKE THEIR MEDICINE. THIS IS VERY DISRUPTIVE TO THEIR EDUCATION AND TO THEIR LEARNING. SB. TWO TWENTY THREE WILL ALLOW THE GOVERNING BOARD OF A KEY TO TWELVE SCHOOL DISTRICT COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS. TO CHOOSE WHETHER TO ADOPT THIS POLICY. IT IS NOT A STATE MANDATE DISTRICTS AND COUNTIES THAT UP IN CAN OPT OUT FOR ANY REASON INCLUDING IF FEDERAL FUNDING IS PUT AT RISK AS A RESULT OF THIS POLICY. SB TWO TWENTY THREE REQUIRES THE STUDENT TO BE A QUALIFIED MEDICAL CANNABIS PATIENT. WITH A DOCTOR'S RECOMMENDATION. TYPICALLY THE MEDICINE IS ADMINISTERED AS OIL CAPSULES TEACHERS LIQUIDS OR TOPICAL CREAMS. THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES THAT A PARENT MUST GIVE THE SCHOOL A COPY OF THEIR CHILD'S MEDICAL CANNABIS RECOMMENDATION TO KEEPON FILE. SIGN IN WHEN THEY COME ON CAMPUS TO ADMINISTER THE MEDICINE NOT DISRUPT THE EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT INTAKE ALL CANNABIS OFFICE SCHOOL GROUNDS. AFTER ADMINISTRATION WASHINGTON COLORADO FLORIDA MAINE AND NEW JERSEY HAVE ALL PASSED LEGISLATION ALLOWING STUDENTS TO USE MEDICAL CANNABIS ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES. THIS BILL ENJOYS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT HAS NO OPPOSITION AND I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE MEMBERS. THANK YOU SENATOR HILL I WOULD REMIND THE FLORIDA PLEASE HOLD IT DOWN IF YOU HAVE A PRIVATE CONVERSATION PLEASE TAKE IT OFF THE FLOOR. I SENATOR STONE. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT YOU'RE DOING A GREAT JOB. THANK YOU SIR I WON APPLY THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- SCHOOL DISTRICTS CERTAINLY SHOULD NOT GET IN THE WAY OF THE DOCTOR PATIENT RELATIONSHIP -- THE REASON WHY WE HAVEN'T BETTER UNDERSTOOD THE EFFICACY OF THE MEDICAL BENEFITS OF CANNABIS IS BECAUSE IT REMAINS A SCHEDULE ONE DRUG WHICH MEANS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DO RESEARCH IN THE UNITED STATES. FOR THE THERAPEUTIC UTILIZATION OF CANNABIS SINISTER RIVETED. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY IS HYPOCRITICAL. BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY HAVE CAN AVOID THAT ARE LEGALLY ALLOWED THROUGH THE FDA BUT YET THE D. A. STILL SAY IT STILL SAYS THAT THERE'S NO MEDICAL VALUE FOR THEM SO HOPEFULLY THE AND WE PASSED A RESOLUTION THAT I AUTHORED LAST YEAR. THAT -- URGE THE FEDERAL SCHEDULE. ONE BECAUSE IF YOU SEE THE RESEARCH THAT IS DONE IN COUNTRIES LIKE ISRAEL YOU'LL SEE THAT THE EFFICACY. FOR THINGS SUCH AS CHILDHOOD SEIZURE DISORDERS -- THE CBD OILS THAT -- DRAMATICALLY HAVE STOPPER TRADITIONAL MEDICATIONS HAVE NOT AND THE OTHER UTILIZATION THIS -- OF OF CANNABIS THAT HAVE COME TO LIGHT SO I APPLAUD THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- I BELIEVE THAT CANNABIS SHOULD BE NO DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHER PRESCRIBE MEDICATION AND ADMINISTERED ULTIMATELY BY A SCHOOL NURSE FOR THE PERMISSION OF THE PARENT UNDERSTANDING THERE'S A PRESCRIPTION FOR THAT MEDICATION BECAUSE OF A GREAT STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. I APPLAUD THE AUTHOR AND I URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER STONE SEEING NO OTHER MIKE'S UP CENTER HILL YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I WANT TO THANK MY GOOD FRIEND FROM TO MACULA FOR HIS COMMENTS AND REALLY THE THE THOUGHTFULNESS OF OF THE ISSUE. BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY IS PREVENTED PREVENTING CHILDREN FROM GETTING AN EDUCATION GETTING THE OPPORTUNITY HAVING THAT OPPORTUNITY. TO GET AN EDUCATION AT SCHOOL WHEN THEIR PARENTS AND IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE JOE JOE. HAS TO GO OFF CAMPUS IN A WHEELCHAIR A THOUSAND FEET. EVERY DAY WHICH TAKES A LOT OF TIME AND A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY AWAY FROM THE EDUCATION. THAT HE SO MUCH DESERVED I RESPECTFULLY ASK DR OF MEMBERS THANK YOU. AND WITH THAT MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ALLEN HI ARCHULETA [inaudible] I ATKINS [inaudible] BATES [inaudible] BELL. BY FOR JUST. NOPE BRADFORD.

MOVING ON TO FILE ITEM. TWENTY THREE AND THAT WOULD BE S. R. S. C. R. TWENTY SIX CENTER JACKSON ARE YOU PREPARED. MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION TWENTY SIX BY SENATOR JACKSON RELATIVE TO EQUAL PAY DAY. CENTER JACKSON THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES. WE STARTED OFF THIS MORNING TALKING ABOUT EQUALITY AND ACKNOWLEDGING THE EXTRAORDINARY EFFORTS BY SAYS ARE CHAVEZ. TO PROVIDE THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR FARMWORKERS IN OUR STATE. TODAY I BRING FORWARD S. C. R. TWENTY SIX WHICH IS ANOTHER EFFORT TO ACHIEVE EQUALITY IN OUR STATE NATION. RECOGNIZING EQUAL PAY DAY. WHICH IS ON TUESDAY OF THE COMING WEEK. AS MANY OF YOU I WOULD SUBMIT PROBABLY MOST IF NOT ALL OF YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU HAVE SPOUSES OR DAUGHTERS OR MOTHERS. WHO HAVE BEEN IN THE WORK FORCE AND WHO HAVE BY VIRTUE OF GENDER? BEEN DISCRIMINATED AGAINST IN PAY IN OPPORTUNITIES IN THE ABILITY TO ADVANCE TO BE HIRED TO BE PROMOTED OR HAVE BEEN HARASSED SO THAT YOU HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO COMPLETE THE WORK. IN THE KIND OF WAY THAT YOU AS SOMEONE SEEKING EXCELLENCE AND QUALITY IN THE WORK WOULD WARRANT AND SO. WE KNOW THAT FOR SO MANY. WHO HAVE TO INTIMATELY THROUGH LIFE EXPERIENCE IN THOSE WOMEN HERE ON THE FLOOR I WOULD SUBMIT WE HAVE ALL? AT SOME POINT EXPERIENCE THAT LEVEL OF INEQUALITY. WE COME BEFORE YOU TODAY TO ACKNOWLEDGE EQUAL PAY DAY. ADD TO RECOGNIZE CERTAIN FACTS THAT CONTINUE TO EXIST. THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND IN OUR NATION IT IS ESTIMATED. THEIR WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA OR PAID ABOUT EIGHTY EIGHT CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR A MAN MAKES. WHICH AMOUNTS TO AN AVERAGE ANNUAL WAGE GAP OF ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. THAT GAP HOWEVER IS WORSE SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE FOR WOMEN OF COLOR. AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN. MAKE ON AVERAGE SIXTY ONE CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR A WHITE MAN WAY MAKES AND LATINOS IN CALIFORNIA. HAVE THE DUBIOUS DISTINCTION OF HAVING THE WORST. WAGE GAP IN THE NATION. LATINOS ARE PAID APPROXIMATELY FIFTY THREE CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR PAID TO A WHITE NON LATINO. MALE. THIS ISN'T JUST A PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS WOMEN AS I MENTIONED FAMILIES. OUR IS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY THIS BECAUSE WOMEN ARE IN THE WORKFORCE TODAY IN GREATER NUMBERS THAN EVER BEFORE AND ARE IN THE WORKFORCE BECAUSE THEIR INCOME IS NECESSARY FOR FAMILIES TO MAKE. ENDS MEET THAT MONEY STAYS IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT MONEY PURCHASES THE GOODS IN THE SERVICES IN THIS NECESSITIES OF LIFE. THAT FAMILIES NEED. AND CONTRARY TO WHAT SOME BELIEVE THIS IS NOT A GAP THAT CAN BE EXPLAINED AWAY SIMPLY BY WOMEN'S LIFE CHOICES. IT'S A GAP THAT EXISTS REGARDLESS OF THE INDUSTRY WOMAN WORKS IN. WHETHER IT'S NURSING OR MANUFACTURING IT'S A GAP THAT EXISTS REGARDLESS OF A WOMAN. TO OUR EDUCATIONAL LEVEL. WOMEN WITH MASTER'S DEGREES ARE STILL PAID LESS THAN MEN WITH THE SAME DEGREE. WOMEN WITH DOCTORAL DEGREES HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE PAID LESS THAN MEN WITH MASTER'S DEGREES. THIS MEASURE STR TWENTY SIX KNOWLEDGES THAT APRIL SECOND. TWENTY NINETEEN IS EQUAL PAY DAY IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT IS THE DAY OF THE YEAR WHEN THE WAGES PAID TO AMERICAN WOMEN. CATCH UP TO THE WAGES PAID TO MEN FOR THE PREVIOUS YEAR. IN OTHER WORDS WE PUT IN A HARD THREE EXTRA MONTHS BEFORE WE MAKE WHAT A MAN HAS BEEN PAID FOR THE PRIOR YEAR. MORE THAN 60%. OF WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA ARE EMPLOYED. AND NEARLY FOUR IN TEN MOTHERS ARE THE PRIMARY BREADWINNER IN THEIR HOUSEHOLDS. TWO THIRDS OF MOTHERS ARE PRIMARY OR SIGNIFICANT EARNERS MAKING PAY EQUITY CRITICAL THE FAMILIES ECONOMIC SECURITY. I AM VERY PROUD THAT WE WERE ABLE TO PASS. IN THIS LEGISLATURE BACK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WHAT WAS THEN THE STRONGEST EQUAL PAY BILL IN THE COUNTRY. THERE ARE NOW FORTY ONE OTHER STATES THAT HAVE USE THAT EQUAL PAY BILL AS A MODEL. IT WAS PASSED WITH ALMOST UNIVERSAL BIPARTISAN SUPPORT BUT THERE IS MUCH WORK YET TO BE DONE. BECAUSE A LIFETIME OF LOWER PAY MEANS WOMEN HAVE LESS INCOME. TO SAVE FOR RETIREMENT AND LESS INCOME COUNTED INTO SOCIAL SECURITY OR PENSION BENEFITS. PLEASE JOIN ME COLLEAGUES IN SUPPORTING EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN ARE EQUAL PAY DAY AND A REMINDER THAT THERE IS STILL MUCH WORK TO BE DONE WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON'S. SENATOR STONE. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I WANT -- TO APPLAUD MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA BARBARA FOR HER-CHAMPIONING -- EQUAL PAY. FOR WOMEN -- GENDER -- ANY TYPE OF DISCRIMINATION -- SHE'S BEEN A CHAMPION AND I APPRECIATE HER EFFORTS. I'D LIKE TO ANNOUNCE THAT -- LAST WEEK -- I HAVE A NEW GRANDDAUGHTER NAME IS COREY GENEVIEVE STONE. I AM VERY -- EXCITED THAT MY MY DAUGHTER BRITNEY. IS EXPECTING TWIN GIRLS. IN EARLY MAY. SO THAT'S GOING TO GIVE ME -- FOUR GRANDDAUGHTERS. I AM VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. BUT I ALSO THINK CONCERN FOR THEM BECAUSE I WANT THEM. THEY HAVE A BETTER LIFE THAN MYSELF. AND I WANT TO ENSURE THAT. WHEN THEY GET JOBS? THAT THE JOB IS GOING TO BE COMMENSURATE WITH [inaudible] A MALE. AND THAT THE PAY THAT THEY GET WILL BE OBJECTIVE BASED ON THE QUALIFICATIONS THAT THEY BRING IN COMPARISON AND CONTRAST. TO A MALE WHEN THEY APPLY FOR THOSE JOBS. BUT MY FRIENDS IF WE'RE GOING TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT THIS WE CAN ENACT LAWS. WE HAVE TO SET AN EXAMPLE. AND BY THAT I MEAN WE NEED TO TAKE OUR A MAGNIFYING GLASS. TWO OR THREE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND PLUS EMPLOYEES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE. GENDER EQUITY. IN PAY. IN OUR OWN STATE GOVERNMENT. AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE'RE NOT THERE YET. WE HAVE A WAYS TO GO. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR IF SHE'S SO INCLINED. TO ENSURE. THAT PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I UNDERSTAND THAT WE STAND. FOR EQUAL PAY IRRESPECTIVE OF THEIR GENDER IRRESPECTIVE OF THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR IRRESPECTIVE STE ON YOUR QUALIFICATIONS AND YOUR EDUCATION -- AND YOUR ABILITY TO DO THE JOB. EVERYONE SHOULD BE PAID FAIRLY. AND EQUALLY AND WE NEED START RIGHT WITHIN OUR OWN STATE INSTITUTION HERE IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU AGAIN TO THE AUTHOR LOOK FOR TO SUPPORTING THE BILL.

BEFORE THE IMMIGRATED TO THE UNITED STATES IN. NINETEEN SIXTY ONE OF THREE OF MY MOTHER'S BROTHERS HAD ALREADY EMIGRATED TO THE UNITED STATES AND EDWARD THE BORE. MY MOTHER'S. BROTHER WAS OUR SPONSOR AND HE WOULD. IN THE LATE SIXTIES ACTUALLY RUN SUCCESSFULLY FOR THE ORANGE COUNTY REPUBLICAN CENTRAL COMMITTEE WORRY SERVE WITH. WALTER NOT OF KNOTS BERRY FARM FAME. THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SEAT WHEN I WAS A YOUNG PERSON FOR WHERE I AM. TODAY. MY FOLKS AMERICANIZED THEIR NAMES TO CANTON RITA AND MINE TO JOHN AND THEY WOULD HAVE TO MORE CHILDREN CAN'T MICHAEL IN A MEMORY. MY DAD LEFT -- HIS SUCCESSFUL FAMILY BUSINESS IN THE GRAIN INDUSTRY SO IF YOU EVER GO TO NORTHERN HALL AND YOU'LL SEE THE MORE LIVE MAIL FOR BRICK -- SORT OF THE BIGGEST BUSINESS IN TOWN IT'S A FLOUR MILL IN THE CITY ABOUT HER IS HER MAIDEN. BUT HERE IN THE STATES HE WENT INTO THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY -- AND ATTAINED THE CHARTERED LIFE UNDERWRITER OR THE SEAL U. DESIGNATION. HE WAS AN AGENT FOR PENN MUTUAL LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY WHERE HE WAS A COLLEAGUE WITH DAVID ****. WHO WOULD LATER BECOME A CALIFORNIA SOME WOMEN IN SENATOR AND FOR WHOM THE **** LOUNGE? IS NAMED AND SO WHEN I WAS TREASURER OF THE COUNTY I ALWAYS COME UP AND ALWAYS BE GREETED. SO NICELY BY DAVID **** SO IT IS SO NICE TO SEE HIS PHOTO. IN THE LOUNGE BECAUSE HE WAS JUST A A DEAR MAN. MY DAD ALSO SOLD PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE AND PRETTY MUCH SOLD WITHIN THE DUTCH COMMUNITY -- FLOWER ARTESIA NORWALK PARAMOUNT LE PALM AND ALL THE WAY. THE CHINO WERE MOST THE DAIRYMAN STARTED TO MOVE TO WHEN I WAS YOUNGER -- HE HE WAS. IT WAS A BUSY MAN STARTING ALL OVER AND SO I WOULD ALWAYS WILL MINIMIZE MY DAD SO BUSY WHY DON'T WANT ONLY. YOU DON'T SEE A MUCH IT HERE I AM LIKE BUSY. BUT HE INSTILLED LOVES IN ME AT HE TOOK US TO THE BEACH I MEAN. WE WERE KIDS YOU KNOW THE THE PACIFIC OCEAN IS A WHOLE LOT BETTER THAN THE NORTH SEA. YOU KNOW YOU GOTTA WAVES AND AND IT'S JUST IT'S A GREAT MOVIE GO TO BOTH THE CHEEK ON SUNDAY AFTERNOONS. HE WOULD TAKE US TO THE SLOPES MY DAD WHEN HE WAS IN COLLEGE WOULD GO TO THE AUSTRIAN ALPS IN SKI IN THE WINTERTIME AND SO HE BROUGHT US TO A MOUNT BALDY BACK IN NINETEEN SIXTY ONE THAT'S WHEN I STARTED SNOW SKIING HERE LOCALLY IN. AND AND THEN HE WOULD TAKE US ALL OVER -- ANYWAY TAKE US ON TRAILS SO HE TOOK US TO THE TOP OF MOUNT ST YOU'RE GOING YOU KNOW THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TOOK US THE TOP OF MOUNT BALDY ARE. MOUNT SAN ANTONIO THE TECHNICAL NAME ONE OF THE MORE MEMORABLE TRIP TRIPS WAS A HIKING TO THE TOP OF MOUNT WHITNEY IN THE SIERRAS AND ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING TRIPS WAS ACTUALLY HIKING TO THE BOTTOM OF THE GRAND CANYON WE WERE TEENAGERS -- GOING TO PHANTOM RANCH. BUT HE WOULD JOIN ME SAID THAT STARTED IN THE ANNUAL BACKPACK TRIP BY BE SUMMER EVERY. SEPTEMBER MY DAD HIKE WITH US FOR A LONG TIME FOR YEARS HE WOULD SAY LET ME START BEFORE YOU GUYS START. AND HE WOULD GO UP THE TRAIL WE MEET HIM AT THE CAMP. WAS IT DRIVES UP AND DOWN THREE NINETY FIVE TO MAMMOTH. WHEN WE WOULD SKI IN THE WINTER THAT I WOULD SEE ALL THESE HISTORICAL LANDMARK SIGNS FIVE HUNDRED YARDS AHEAD OR WHATEVER AND SO THAT STARTED A HOBBY OF VISITING EVERY HISTORICAL LANDMARK? IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT HIS FOCUS WAS WORLD WAR. TWO AND IT DIDN'T TAKE US TO NORMAL MOVIES HE WOULD TAKE A STEP TOWARD TOWARD TORAH OR THE LONGEST DAY OR PATENT WAS. THAT WAS WHAT MY DAD WATCHING SO MEMBER NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE IN MY SENIOR YEAR IN HIGH SCHOOL STARTING COLLEGE EVERY SUNDAY NIGHT WE HAD WATCH WORLD AT WAR WHICH WAS A SERIES BACK THEN IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE THAT WAS JUST SUCH A FOCAL POINT FOR MY DAD. BUT ONE OF THE FUN THINGS ABOUT MY DAD WAS THAT HE TALKED TO EVERYBODY. YEAH HE WAS VERY RIGOROUSLY IN COMPLETE STRANGERS ANY WITH ENGAGE IN. AND SOMETIMES WE GO. WHAT'S TO NETWORK RIGHT IF YOU KNOW THESE PEOPLE. IT WAS SORT OF A RUNNING KIND OF THING BUT HERE WE ARE AS ADULTS TALKING TO EVERYONE AND HAVING FUN. AND THEN FOR SOME OF US WITHOUT SOMETIMES YOU MAYBE MAYBE HE WAS A LITTLE DISTANT WHEN WE WERE. TOGETHER BUT I THINK THAT MADE IS FIRSTLY INDEPENDENT THIS FOR KIDS -- HE RAISED US IN THE DUTCH REFORMED CHURCH OF AMERICA THE RCA SO WE WERE RAISED IN A CHRISTIAN HOME A GREAT CHURCH. BUT WITH THAT HE HE SORT OF HAD AN ABRAHAM ASPECT OF HIS LIFE HE HE SAID THAT -- WHEN ABRAHAM WAS TOLD BY GOD YOU KNOW LEAVE LEAVE AND GO TO A LAND THAT I WILL SHOW YOU -- THAT THAT SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING THAT WAS EMBEDDED MY FATHER TO BECAUSE LEAVING.
