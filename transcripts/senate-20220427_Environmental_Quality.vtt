00:43:11.255 --> 00:43:12.489
BELIEVE CONTRACTORS SHOULD BE

QUICK PREQUALIFIED FOR HAZARDOUS

00:43:15.826 --> 00:43:18.128

IT WOULD ESTABLISH A PRE

00:43:38.115 --> 00:43:41.051
QUALIFIED CONTRACTOR LIST. AND

00:43:41.118 --> 00:43:43.454

00:51:31.555 --> 00:51:32.556
FURTHER BECAUSE- CONTRACT GOT

00:51:32.622 --> 00:51:35.392
THE- I COST THE- COST MORE MONEY

00:51:35.459 --> 00:51:37.260
AND IT ALSO HURT A LOCAL

00:51:37.327 --> 00:51:38.562
CONTRACTOR BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T

00:51:38.628 --> 00:51:40.630

WANT YOU AS IT GOES FORWARD

00:51:49.339 --> 00:51:50.674
THERE HAS TO BE. ABILITY TO HELP

00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:52.042
MAKE THE COMMUNITY HOLE FOR THE

00:51:52.108 --> 00:51:53.009
PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY LOST

00:51:53.076 --> 00:51:54.177
EVERYTHING IF THEY HAVE THE

00:51:54.244 --> 00:51:58.014
SKILLS AND THEY HAVE THE IN THE

00:51:58.081 --> 00:52:00.517
FACILITIES TO DO IT. RIGHT THIRD

00:52:00.584 --> 00:52:03.587
HERE VETERANS PLEASE YOU I'M AND

00:52:03.653 --> 00:52:05.655
I WILL SOMETIMES GET CHOKED UP

00:52:05.722 --> 00:52:08.258
ABOUT IT AND I APOLOGIZE JUST

00:52:08.325 --> 00:52:09.025
BECAUSE IT'S BEEN. IT'S BEEN

00:52:09.092 --> 00:52:12.028
AWFUL. SEEN YEAR AFTER YEAR SO

00:52:12.095 --> 00:52:14.097
MANY COMMUNITIES WHETHER IT'S IN

00:52:14.164 --> 00:52:16.633
SIR DOLLARS ECHO THE WORDS ARE

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:17.868
ON THE NORTH COAST SO MANY

00:52:17.934 --> 00:52:19.336
COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN LEVELED.

00:52:19.402 --> 00:52:21.705
AND WHAT I HAVE LEARNED IS THAT

00:52:21.771 --> 00:52:24.140
WE WERE NOT PREPARED FOR THIS

00:52:24.207 --> 00:52:25.275
REALITY THAT WE'RE ALL FACING

00:52:25.342 --> 00:52:26.910
RIGHT NOW. SO THERE BEEN THREE

00:52:26.977 --> 00:52:28.211
THAT'S RIGHT THINK THAT WE

00:52:28.278 --> 00:52:30.881
SHOULD TAKE AND- CANDIDLY THANKS

00:52:30.947 --> 00:52:32.816
TO THE LEADERSHIP OF. CARE BY

00:52:32.883 --> 00:52:35.685
CASKEY- WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET

00:52:35.752 --> 00:52:37.921
THERE ON TO THE STEPS THE FIRST

00:52:37.988 --> 00:52:41.224
AND FOREMOST. WE LEARN A LOT IN

00:52:41.291 --> 00:52:42.392
TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AFTER THE

00:52:42.459 --> 00:52:43.560
VALLEY FIRE TORE THROUGH

00:52:43.627 --> 00:52:46.830
MIDDLETOWN. AND BURNED DOWN

00:52:46.897 --> 00:52:49.366
ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED HOMES. IT

00:52:49.432 --> 00:52:52.035
DESTROYED CAL RECYCLE THERE WAS

00:52:52.102 --> 00:52:53.737
NO INTERNAL DEPARTMENT THAT WAS

00:52:53.803 --> 00:52:57.040
FOCUSED ON DEBRIS AND WE HAD TO

00:52:57.107 --> 00:52:59.009
BE A REBUILD IT FROM THE GROUND

00:52:59.075 --> 00:53:00.744
UP. AND IT WAS A STATE SPONSORED

00:53:00.810 --> 00:53:02.445
PROJECTS THE OF TWO DIFFERENT

00:53:02.512 --> 00:53:03.179
PROJECTS WHEN IT COMES TO CLEAN

00:53:03.246 --> 00:53:05.148
UP DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF THE

00:53:05.215 --> 00:53:06.850
FIRE RIGHT STATE AND OR FEDERAL.

00:53:06.917 --> 00:53:10.186
SO IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN IT

00:53:10.253 --> 00:53:10.921
WAS STATE WE LEARNED THAT WE

00:53:10.987 --> 00:53:13.123
NEED TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT AN

00:53:13.189 --> 00:53:14.391
ENTIRE DEPARTMENT FOR DEBRIS

00:53:14.457 --> 00:53:14.891
REMOVAL INTERNAL ACCOUNT

00:53:14.958 --> 00:53:17.727
RECYCLE. THANKS TO THE DIRECTION

00:53:17.794 --> 00:53:20.564
OF DIRECTOR WAGNER. AND THAT MAY

00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:22.532
SEEM LEADERSHIP I'VE JEREMIH

00:53:22.599 --> 00:53:24.200
CASKEY THEY ARE NEARLY FULLY

00:53:24.267 --> 00:53:25.802
STAFFED WITH AN INTERNAL

00:53:25.869 --> 00:53:28.405
DEPARTMENT AND ALL THE FLIPPING

COORDINATE WITH THE OFFICE OF

00:53:34.377 --> 00:53:37.113
EMERGENCY SERVICES. AT THE TABLE

00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:38.748

WE TRY TO WORK THROUGH THE

00:53:49.726 --> 00:53:51.561
CHALLENGES THAT- CENTER DOLLY

00:53:51.628 --> 00:53:53.663
HAS JUST ADDRESSED. WHAT WE'VE

00:53:53.730 --> 00:53:55.565
LEARNED TO A STEP TWO WE GOTTA

00:53:55.632 --> 00:53:57.233
GET OR PRE QUALIFIED LIST THIS

00:53:57.300 --> 00:53:59.936
IS CRAZY WE'RE BRINGING IN LARGE

00:54:00.003 --> 00:54:01.938
CONTRACTORS FROM FLORIDA. I TO

00:54:02.005 --> 00:54:04.808
COME DO THE WORK. AND THEN THEY

00:54:04.874 --> 00:54:07.210
SCRAMBLE TO BE ABLE TO GET THE

00:54:07.277 --> 00:54:08.511
QUALIFIED WORKFORCE SO WHAT WE

00:54:08.578 --> 00:54:10.747
DID IN MIDDLETOWN AND OFFERING

00:54:10.814 --> 00:54:12.849
JUNIORS CAN TALK ABOUT THIS IS

00:54:12.916 --> 00:54:14.317
THEY ACTUALLY WORKING WITH THE

00:54:14.384 --> 00:54:15.619
STATE OFF THE MERCY SERVICES

00:54:15.685 --> 00:54:17.020
WERE ABLE TO HIRE A LITTLE LESS

00:54:17.087 --> 00:54:20.690
THAN A THIRD OF THE ACTUAL

00:54:20.757 --> 00:54:22.158
CLEANUP WORK FORCE. FROM THE

00:54:22.225 --> 00:54:24.060
COUNTY. FROM THE CAP YOU HAVE TO

00:54:24.127 --> 00:54:25.629
GO THROUGH TWO WEEKS

00:54:25.695 --> 00:54:26.162
CERTIFICATION HAS WHOPPER

TRAINING THEY'RE ABLE TO DO THAT

00:54:28.198 --> 00:54:29.666
AND I FIRMLY BELIEVE UNDER THIS

00:54:29.733 --> 00:54:31.501
PLAN WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO GET

00:54:31.568 --> 00:54:33.103
MORE FOLKS BACK TO WORK AND WHEN

00:54:33.169 --> 00:54:35.005
THEY NEED IT MOST BECAUSE THESE

00:54:35.071 --> 00:54:36.139
FOLKS HAVE LOST LITERALLY

00:54:36.206 --> 00:54:38.608
EVERYTHING. IN OUR LIFE. SO IT

00:54:38.675 --> 00:54:39.643
IS ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT TO DO

00:54:39.709 --> 00:54:41.945
THAT. THE THIRD ITEM I WOULD

00:54:42.012 --> 00:54:45.348
JUST SAY IS- WE HAVE TO HAVE TWO

00:54:45.415 --> 00:54:46.282
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. WE HAVE TO

00:54:46.349 --> 00:54:49.119
GET- TREES OUT PLUS WE HAVE TO

00:54:49.185 --> 00:54:51.354
GET DEBRIS OUT AND SO THAT YOU

WOULD HAVE A PRE QUALIFICATION.

00:54:53.156 --> 00:54:55.158
I CALL A CONTRACTOR COULD BE

00:54:55.225 --> 00:54:56.993

00:54:59.095 --> 00:55:00.930
IS THAT ANY OTHER PIECE I'M JUST

00:55:00.997 --> 00:55:02.532
BEING REALLY TRANSPARENT WITH

00:55:02.599 --> 00:55:03.667

01:26:22.677 --> 01:26:25.013
COULD SPEND THE MONEY THE SAME

01:26:25.079 --> 01:26:27.148
MONEY ON VERY TIGHT GESTURES

01:26:27.215 --> 01:26:28.449
FORTY THREE MILLION AS WE DID ON

01:26:28.516 --> 01:26:31.185
PCC'S WE WOULD HAVE FIVE MILLION

01:26:31.252 --> 01:26:33.655
METRIC TONS OF CARBON REDUCTION.

01:26:33.721 --> 01:26:35.957
COMPARED TO TWO HUNDRED MILLION

01:26:36.024 --> 01:26:37.592
WITH THAT SAID I'M JUST I'M

01:26:37.659 --> 01:26:38.660
DOING THAT FOR COMPARISONS

01:26:38.726 --> 01:26:40.995
BECAUSE BECAUSE WE'VE GOT TO GET

01:26:41.062 --> 01:26:44.465
EIGHTY UP ON REDUCING CARBON-

01:26:44.532 --> 01:26:46.901
BUT WE HAVE THIS PROGRAM. AND

01:26:46.968 --> 01:26:48.736
ITS COMPETITIVE PROGRAMS AND

01:26:48.803 --> 01:26:52.674
SOME SMALLER FOLKS ARE NOT BEING

01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:54.842
A- COMPLICATED. AS TO THE HAVE

01:26:54.909 --> 01:26:59.147
NOTS SO. BUT LIKE WE GOTTA GET A

01:26:59.213 --> 01:27:01.149
LOT OF BANG FOR OUR BUCK BUT

01:27:01.215 --> 01:27:03.184
SINCE WE ALREADY GOT THE PUCK

01:27:03.251 --> 01:27:03.952
OUT THERE ARE GOING TO SUPPORT

01:27:04.018 --> 01:27:05.753
THIS PROGRAM WHICH ALLOWS OTHER

01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:07.989
SMALLER ENTITIES TO COMPETE FOR

01:27:08.056 --> 01:27:10.291
THESE PROGRAMS TO GET PERHAPS

01:27:10.358 --> 01:27:11.793
MAYBE A LARGER BENEFITS THAN

01:27:11.859 --> 01:27:13.595
WHAT WE'RE SEEING FROM THE EIGHT

01:27:13.661 --> 01:27:14.896
PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:27:14.963 --> 01:27:16.531
NOTWITHSTANDING WHAT COIN IS

01:27:16.598 --> 01:27:18.066
DOING TO BE UNIFIED THEIR THEIR

01:27:18.132 --> 01:27:19.867
CITY BUT THAT'S THAT'S- I

01:27:19.934 --> 01:27:21.703
THOUGHT IT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY

01:27:21.769 --> 01:27:23.671
FOR CLIMATE LESSONS SO I TOOK

01:27:23.738 --> 01:27:25.106
THE OPPORTUNITY. AND I MOVED THE

01:27:25.173 --> 01:27:29.310
BILL- IT IS UNDERSTOOD. THAT'S

01:27:29.377 --> 01:27:31.112
ALL I WAS GONNA DO IS MOVE THE

01:27:31.179 --> 01:27:32.380
BILL COULD PLEASE LEGISLATION

01:27:32.447 --> 01:27:34.682
NOT MY OWN MAYBE IN YOUR CLOTHES

01:27:34.749 --> 01:27:35.350
YOU CAN DRESS BUT- HOW SMALL CAN

01:27:35.416 --> 01:27:38.920
YOU GET WITH THESE LIKE- BECAUSE-I NOTICED IN THE DEFINITION OF.

01:27:38.987 --> 01:27:40.822
UNDER RESOURCE COMMUNITIES COULD

01:27:40.888 --> 01:27:42.724
EVEN BE A LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLD.

01:27:42.790 --> 01:27:44.125
FOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITY BUT

01:27:44.192 --> 01:27:45.860
BILL. I JUST DON'T I I'M TRYING

01:27:45.927 --> 01:27:47.662
TO THINK. OF THESE LITTLE

01:27:47.729 --> 01:27:49.464
POCKETS OF AREAS LIKE IN LA

01:27:49.530 --> 01:27:51.332
WE'VE CANOGA PARK RIGHT. LOST IN

01:27:51.399 --> 01:27:53.835
THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. HARD TO

01:27:53.901 --> 01:27:57.405
ORGANIZE THEIR IT'S TOUGH. AND

01:27:57.472 --> 01:27:59.107
BUT SO YOU KNOW THEY HAVE ALL

01:27:59.173 --> 01:28:00.308
KINDS OF OPPORTUNITY BUT- I

01:28:00.375 --> 01:28:02.110
DON'T LIKE HOW MUCH ORGANIZING

01:28:02.176 --> 01:28:04.145
AS A COMMUNITY. HAVE TO DO TO

01:28:04.212 --> 01:28:06.047
QUALIFY FOR ONE OF THESE IT

01:28:06.114 --> 01:28:08.116
COULD JUST BE A- HOUSEHOLD

01:28:08.182 --> 01:28:08.716

FIND IS PROJECTS THAT ARE

01:28:15.723 --> 01:28:17.191
PROBABLY THE ONE TO FIVE MILLION

01:28:17.258 --> 01:28:18.393
DOLLAR RANGE THAT. WOULD OKAY

01:28:18.459 --> 01:28:19.694
YOU KNOW AND NEIGHBORHOOD LEVEL

01:28:19.761 --> 01:28:21.295
OF PROBABLY THE SMALLEST UNIT IF

01:28:21.362 --> 01:28:22.864
THAT MAKES SENSE YEAH. IT DOES

01:28:22.930 --> 01:28:26.668

01:28:33.508 --> 01:28:35.510
A BUDGET ASKS US HERE WITH THIS-

01:28:35.576 --> 01:28:37.745
IF YOU COULD CLARIFY. AND JUST

01:28:37.812 --> 01:28:40.014
REAL QUICKLY HI I LIKE THE GOAL

01:28:40.081 --> 01:28:42.550
OF THE BILL BUT- TO HAVE JUST

01:28:42.617 --> 01:28:44.485
YOU KNOW NO IDEA OF HOW MUCH

01:28:44.552 --> 01:28:47.288
MONEY AND- TO SENATOR STERN'S

01:28:47.355 --> 01:28:48.222
QUESTION HOW DO WE KNOW THAT

01:28:48.289 --> 01:28:50.158
SMALLER COMMUNITIES CAN COMPETE.

01:28:50.224 --> 01:28:52.760
I'M GONNA LAY OFF TODAY BUT I DO

01:28:52.827 --> 01:28:55.730
LIKE THE IDEA. OF THAT. GIVE

01:28:55.797 --> 01:28:59.167
GOOD JOB. THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY

01:28:59.233 --> 01:29:02.870
BUDGET I ASKED FOR AN ADDITIONAL

01:29:02.937 --> 01:29:04.806
SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS FOR

01:29:04.872 --> 01:29:06.441
TCC SO IS AS I READ THIS I

01:29:06.507 --> 01:29:08.676
WITHOUT THAT THAT WOULD BE

01:29:08.743 --> 01:29:14.482
FORTUNATE THAT. I HAVE FOR.

01:29:14.549 --> 01:29:18.753
RIGHT WHAT WILL BE. ULTIMATELY

01:29:18.820 --> 01:29:22.590
CITIES YOU SEE LIGHT. YEAH SO

01:29:22.657 --> 01:29:23.825
LOOK I THINK THE ANSWER HERE'S

01:29:23.891 --> 01:29:25.526
THIS. I MEAN I THINK WHAT YOU

01:29:25.593 --> 01:29:27.028
KNOW AND I'VE BEEN HAMMERING THE

01:29:27.095 --> 01:29:28.396
SAME POINT THE SENATE WOULD COST

01:29:28.463 --> 01:29:30.064
YOU DID ALL OF OUR CLIMATE

01:29:30.131 --> 01:29:31.332
GROUPS. YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE

01:29:31.399 --> 01:29:33.101
TALKING ABOUT GETS GET MONEY TO

01:29:33.167 --> 01:29:34.035
REDUCE CAUGHT PEOPLE'S BILLS

01:29:34.102 --> 01:29:35.069
LET'S HAVE MONEY TO DO THESE

01:29:35.136 --> 01:29:37.105
OTHER THINGS AND IF OUR CLEAR

01:29:37.171 --> 01:29:39.240
OBJECTIVE IS JUST TO REDUCE GHGS

01:29:39.307 --> 01:29:41.509
I THINK WE SHOULD SPEND THREE

01:29:41.576 --> 01:29:42.577
BILLION DOLLARS AND ADJUSTERS

01:29:42.643 --> 01:29:44.078
AND THEY SHOULDN'T BE A PLACE

01:29:44.145 --> 01:29:45.079
WHERE WE COULD POSSIBLY PUT IT

01:29:45.146 --> 01:29:46.514
DIGESTED SHOULDN'T BE THERE. NOT

01:29:46.581 --> 01:29:47.915
ONLY BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF

01:29:47.982 --> 01:29:49.951
THE GHGS BUT ALSO THE METHANE

01:29:50.017 --> 01:29:52.286
THE SHORT TERM POLLUTANTS THE

01:29:52.353 --> 01:29:53.988
IMPACT EIGHT WHAT EIGHTY TIMES

01:29:54.055 --> 01:29:55.690
WHAT THE IMPACT IS OF CARBON

01:29:55.757 --> 01:29:58.025
EXTRAORDINARY RIGHT IT IS A IT'S

01:29:58.092 --> 01:29:59.060
A REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION

01:29:59.127 --> 01:30:01.429
ABOUT. WHAT OUR OBJECTIVES ARE

01:30:01.496 --> 01:30:03.097
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S

01:30:03.164 --> 01:30:04.165
HAPPENED WHERE WHERE WE TALKED

01:30:04.232 --> 01:30:05.967
LAST ON THE FLOOR THAT WAS WILL

01:30:06.033 --> 01:30:07.034
CONTROVERSIAL ABOUT THE IDEA OF

01:30:07.101 --> 01:30:08.269
CLIMATE CHANGE VERSUS CLIMATE

01:30:08.336 --> 01:30:10.104
CHANGED WE NOW FIFTEEN EXTREME

01:30:10.171 --> 01:30:12.707
HEAT WE'RE NOW FACING IMPACTS ON

01:30:12.774 --> 01:30:14.575
INDIVIDUALIZED COMMITTEES. THE

01:30:14.642 --> 01:30:17.078
IDEA IT SEEMS TO ME IN TERMS OF

01:30:17.145 --> 01:30:18.713
THE DEMOCRACY IS TO GIVE

01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:20.181
OPPORTUNITIES TO COMMUNITIES

01:30:20.248 --> 01:30:21.282
THAT CAN'T DON'T HAVE THE P. H.

01:30:21.349 --> 01:30:24.652
D.'S IN AND A BUREAUCRACY TO GET

01:30:24.719 --> 01:30:26.621
ACCESS TO FUNDS TO IMPROVE THEIR

01:30:26.687 --> 01:30:28.823
COMMUNITIES THAT MAY NOT REDUCE

01:30:28.890 --> 01:30:30.158
EXCHANGES MUCH BUT MAYBE MAKE

01:30:30.224 --> 01:30:31.058
THINGS MORE COMFORTABLE MAYBE

01:30:31.125 --> 01:30:33.127
DEAL EXTREMELY MAYBE DO OTHER

01:30:33.194 --> 01:30:34.128
THINGS. THAT IMPROVE THE QUALITY

01:30:34.195 --> 01:30:36.164
OF THE COMMITTEE BEING FORMED A

01:30:36.230 --> 01:30:37.398
COMMUNITY IN A WAY THAT DEALS

01:30:37.465 --> 01:30:39.066
WITH THIS CLIMATE CHANGE WE HAVE

01:30:39.133 --> 01:30:40.902
TO YOU KNOW WHEN WE DID AB

01:30:40.968 --> 01:30:42.804
THIRTY TWO BACK IN TWO THOUSAND

01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:43.938
SIX RIGHT HE WAS WITH DARIA FROM

01:30:44.005 --> 01:30:45.940
ARE USED TO CALL THE EYE OF THE

01:30:46.007 --> 01:30:47.008
BEHOLDER BILL NO ONE REALLY

01:30:47.074 --> 01:30:49.010
BELIEVED IT NO ONE KNEW WHICH

01:30:49.076 --> 01:30:49.977
CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL. LOVE

01:30:50.044 --> 01:30:51.946
ABOUT BLOOD SO WE JUST SAID FINE

01:30:52.013 --> 01:30:53.214
LET'S JUST GIVE THIS ALL TO AN

01:30:53.281 --> 01:30:55.783
AGENCY AND SEE WE CAN MOVE IN

01:30:55.850 --> 01:30:56.617
THIS DIRECTION NOW WE'VE EVOLVED

01:30:56.684 --> 01:30:59.754
INTO A MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT

01:30:59.821 --> 01:31:00.354
DISCUSSION AROUND CLIMATE THE

01:31:00.421 --> 01:31:04.492
IMPACT. AND GOING FOR. THE WHAT

01:31:04.559 --> 01:31:07.728
THAT LOOKS LIKE. AND SO AS WE

01:31:07.795 --> 01:31:08.396
ARE TO CREATE THE ARE. FRAMEWORK

01:31:08.462 --> 01:31:09.697
IF YOU WILL. YOU KNOW YOU COURSE

01:31:09.764 --> 01:31:11.199
CORRECT ALONG THE WAY. YOU LEARN

01:31:11.265 --> 01:31:13.100
YOU GROW WE DO TEACH YOU SEE

01:31:13.167 --> 01:31:13.968
THAT SOME INTERESTING IMPACTS.

01:31:14.035 --> 01:31:15.903
YOU KNOW AND SO NOW WHAT WE'VE

01:31:15.970 --> 01:31:17.104
LEARNED IS IT'S HARD. FOR

01:31:17.171 --> 01:31:18.940
SMALLER GROUPS TO BE ABLE TO DO

01:31:19.006 --> 01:31:20.842
THIS GLORIA BOARD THAT HAS TO GO

01:31:20.908 --> 01:31:22.043
BECAUSE PROCESS THERE'S A CHECK

01:31:22.109 --> 01:31:23.845
AND BALANCE OF ALL THE SYSTEMS.

01:31:23.911 --> 01:31:25.346
IS NOT JUST WRITING CHECKS AS

01:31:25.413 --> 01:31:26.914
THE WHOLE PROCESS YOU HAVE TO GO

01:31:26.981 --> 01:31:28.349
THROUGH. WHAT WE WANT TO MAKE IT

01:31:28.416 --> 01:31:30.184
EASIER FOR COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

01:31:30.251 --> 01:31:31.185
OTHERWISE INSPIRED. THE IMPACT

01:31:31.252 --> 01:31:31.986
THEIR LOCAL NEIGHBORHOODS TO

ALLOW THEM TO DO SO. AND I THINK

01:31:34.155 --> 01:31:35.723

TRANSIT PRIORITY AREAS AND

01:38:36.777 --> 01:38:40.014
FRANKLY- I'M- MIKE MY AT ONE OF

01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:42.683
THE CO AUTHORS ON THIS BILL

01:38:42.750 --> 01:38:44.385
SENATOR ROTH ONE OF THE REASON

01:38:44.451 --> 01:38:46.287
HE IS SO SOLIDLY IN FAVOR OF

01:38:46.353 --> 01:38:49.156
COMING UP WITH A SOLUTION. IS

01:38:49.223 --> 01:38:51.525
WHAT THEY HAVE SEEN IN RIVERSIDE

01:38:51.592 --> 01:38:54.428
IS. OF PEOPLE. IN THE LA AREA

01:38:54.495 --> 01:38:55.963
WHO CAN WHO WANT TO BE ABLE TO

01:38:56.030 --> 01:38:57.965
AFFORD TO BUY THEIR OWN HOME AND

THEN GET OUT- IN IN RIVERSIDE

01:39:01.035 --> 01:39:03.404
AND THE CONGESTION AND THE- THAT

01:39:03.470 --> 01:39:06.774
DRIVING IS SO. DIFFICULT THAT

01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:09.910
THEY- THEY THEN START TO

01:39:09.977 --> 01:39:14.381
ORGANIZE AROUND. AT THAT IT

01:39:14.448 --> 01:39:16.684
IMPACTING THE FREEWAY SYSTEMS

01:39:16.750 --> 01:39:17.751
ARE EXPANDING THE FREEWAY

01:39:17.818 --> 01:39:20.587
SYSTEMS- IN AND WHEN YOU REALLY

01:39:20.654 --> 01:39:22.523
THINK ABOUT IT ONE OF THE

01:39:22.589 --> 01:39:23.657
CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE IS THAT

01:39:23.724 --> 01:39:26.093
WERE IMPOSING THIS SYSTEM ON TOP

01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:28.762
OF IN AN EQUAL DEVELOPMENT OF

01:39:28.829 --> 01:39:30.698
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE STATE

01:39:30.764 --> 01:39:34.468
AND SO WE WE'VE DONE IT IN A WAY

01:39:34.535 --> 01:39:35.803
THAT ACTUALLY THAT PENALIZING

01:39:35.869 --> 01:39:37.338
THE COMMUNITIES ARE BUILDING THE

01:39:37.404 --> 01:39:38.339
HOUSING AND THAT PENALIZING THE

01:39:38.405 --> 01:39:41.308
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE POOR-

01:39:41.375 --> 01:39:44.678
BECAUSE- PEOPLE MOVE THERE

01:39:44.745 --> 01:39:46.380
BECAUSE THEY CAN AFFORD TO MOVE

01:39:46.447 --> 01:39:48.482
THERE- AND IT STARTS PUSHING OUT

01:39:48.549 --> 01:39:50.751
RESIDENTS THAT LIVE IN THE

01:39:50.818 --> 01:39:52.920
COMMUNITY BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY.

01:39:52.986 --> 01:39:54.288
IN THE GUEST BOOK THAT ARE

01:39:54.355 --> 01:39:56.390
MOVING IN ARE EARNING TWO TO

01:39:56.457 --> 01:39:58.258
THREE TIMES MORE THAN THE PEOPLE

01:39:58.325 --> 01:40:00.361
WHO ORIGINALLY LIVED THERE AND

01:40:00.427 --> 01:40:02.129
SO IT STARTS CREATING THESE

01:40:02.196 --> 01:40:04.932
INEQUALITIES AND- THE CHALLENGES

01:40:04.998 --> 01:40:06.300
SAID THEN PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO

01:40:06.367 --> 01:40:08.035
BUILD ANYMORE HOUSING BECAUSE IT

01:40:08.102 --> 01:40:10.337
BECOMES IT STARTS IMPACTING

01:40:10.404 --> 01:40:12.206
THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THEIR AND

01:40:12.272 --> 01:40:13.107
THEIR COMMUTE SO. DO WE HAVE

01:40:13.173 --> 01:40:17.745
HERE. WE FLARED OVER A SYSTEM

01:40:17.811 --> 01:40:21.715
IN- IN OUR ATTEMPT TO REDUCE

01:40:21.782 --> 01:40:24.451
GREENHOUSE GASES BUT WILL THE

01:40:24.518 --> 01:40:26.220
COMMUNITIES IT REALLY SHOULD BE

01:40:26.286 --> 01:40:28.722
PROVIDING A LOT MORE HOUSING-

01:40:28.789 --> 01:40:30.591
AREN'T DOING IT AND PEOPLE ARE

01:40:30.657 --> 01:40:32.192
STILL GOING TO COMMUTE LONG

01:40:32.259 --> 01:40:33.927
DISTANCES SO NOT ONLY YOU THINK

01:40:33.994 --> 01:40:35.396
IT'S GONNA COMMUTE LONG

01:40:35.462 --> 01:40:36.397
DISTANCES BUT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE

01:40:36.463 --> 01:40:38.565
TO PAY A LOT MORE MONEY FOR THE

01:40:38.632 --> 01:40:40.367
HOUSING AND- AND OF COURSE AS I

01:40:40.434 --> 01:40:42.436
SAID IT DRIVES UP THE- THE COST

01:40:42.503 --> 01:40:43.737
OF HOUSING IN THOSE COMMUNITIES

01:40:43.804 --> 01:40:46.340
SO THAT. LOCAL PEOPLE CAN AFFORD

01:40:46.407 --> 01:40:50.444
IT EITHER SO- I THINK THAT THE

01:40:50.511 --> 01:40:54.448
WHOLE POINT OF THIS IS THAT-

01:40:54.515 --> 01:40:55.916
WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO IS TO

01:40:55.983 --> 01:40:57.785

01:41:04.858 --> 01:41:06.760
AROUND TRANSPORTATION AND DO IT

01:41:06.827 --> 01:41:08.328
IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T END UP

01:41:08.395 --> 01:41:09.897
NEGATIVELY IMPACT US AGAIN I

01:41:09.963 --> 01:41:11.265

01:41:45.599 --> 01:41:47.267
RIVER SOME ERROR IN TERMS OF

01:41:47.334 --> 01:41:49.703
SUBMITTING SUBMITTING THAT

01:41:49.770 --> 01:41:51.672

STAKEHOLDERS IN THE CHAIR I'M IN

01:41:55.042 --> 01:41:56.210
IT EXCEPT THE COMMITTEE

01:41:56.276 --> 01:41:57.211
AMENDMENTS AT THIS TIME THERE

01:41:57.277 --> 01:41:59.279
OUTLINED ON. PAGES ELEVEN AND

01:41:59.346 --> 01:42:01.181
TWELVE OF THE ANALYSIS IN WITH

01:42:01.248 --> 01:42:03.617
THE CAVIAR- I DON'T LIKE STUDIES

01:42:03.684 --> 01:42:05.552
IT'S USUALLY A WAITED TO SHELVE

01:42:05.619 --> 01:42:06.987
SOMETHING AND NOT GET ANYTHING

01:42:07.054 --> 01:42:09.356
DONE BUT I THINK THIS THERE'S A

01:42:09.423 --> 01:42:11.992
REAL INTERSECTION HERE BETWEEN

01:42:12.059 --> 01:42:14.161
HOUSING TRANSPORTATION AND THE

01:42:14.228 --> 01:42:16.430
ENVIRONMENT. AND WE HAVE TO GET

01:42:16.497 --> 01:42:19.099
IT RIGHT AND SO- IT MAY BE THAT

01:42:19.166 --> 01:42:20.634
THAT THERE'S A SOLUTION THAT WE

01:42:20.701 --> 01:42:22.636
CAN COME TO IF WE GET ALL THE

01:42:22.703 --> 01:42:24.304
GROUPS TOGETHER AND TRY TO

01:42:24.371 --> 01:42:25.372
FIGURE OUT. WE KNOW SOMETHING

01:42:25.439 --> 01:42:27.274
SHORT OF A STUDY BUT IT MAY BE

01:42:27.341 --> 01:42:29.209
THAT THE STUDIES THE ONLY WAY TO

01:42:29.276 --> 01:42:30.310
GET THAT INFORMATION I JUST

01:42:30.377 --> 01:42:32.779
DON'T WANT TO SEND THIS BACK TO

01:42:32.846 --> 01:42:33.747
THE SAME ENTITY THAT PREPARED.

01:42:33.814 --> 01:42:35.482
THE IBM T. IN THE FIRST PLACE

01:42:35.549 --> 01:42:36.783
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK WE'RE

01:42:36.850 --> 01:42:38.151
GOING TO END UP WITH A DIFFERENT

01:42:38.218 --> 01:42:39.353
RESULT AND I DON'T THINK THAT.

01:42:39.419 --> 01:42:41.388
THAT THERE WAS ENOUGH OF AN

01:42:41.455 --> 01:42:42.189
ANALYSIS OF OUR PRIORITY ON

01:42:42.256 --> 01:42:44.291

01:42:44.358 --> 01:42:46.693
THAT WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO

01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:48.262

THIS ISN'T GOING TO GET US THERE

01:42:54.868 --> 01:42:56.537
SO- I PUT I PUT. THE CHAIRS

01:42:56.603 --> 01:42:59.673

SEPTEMBER TWELFTH THAT LOCKS

01:46:05.625 --> 01:46:07.928
NIGHT OF SESSION- IT WAS ABOUT

THE GOLDWASSER BILL THAT THAT

01:46:12.999 --> 01:46:14.301
IN OUR PERSPECTIVE ALWAYS MEANT

01:46:14.367 --> 01:46:15.068
FOR TRANSPORTATION PRIORITY

01:46:15.135 --> 01:46:17.604
AREAS AND SO THIS BILL IS VERY

01:46:17.671 --> 01:46:20.574
CONSISTENT WITH THAT- AND WHILE

01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:21.975
THERE WAS A PROCESS THROUGH. TO

AND SOME AS YOU MENTIONED IN

01:46:51.338 --> 01:46:52.572
YOUR OWN DISTRICT- THAT THEY'RE

01:46:52.639 --> 01:46:55.108
CREATING THESE INEQUITIES AND

01:46:55.175 --> 01:46:57.277
HOUSING COST AND SOCIAL

01:46:57.344 --> 01:46:59.112
INEQUITIES- WE JUST WANTED TO

POINT OUT IN THE ANALYSIS-

01:47:00.747 --> 01:47:01.915
BEFORE I. FINISH UP HERE IS

01:47:01.982 --> 01:47:03.850
THAT- THERE IS A REFERENCE TO

01:47:03.917 --> 01:47:05.418
THE COURT CASE- THE TWO HUNDRED

VERSUS OF THE ARTIFACT. TECH

01:47:06.887 --> 01:47:08.188

GIVE THIS MORE CONSIDERATION. I

01:47:27.574 --> 01:47:29.242
THINK WHEN YOU HEAR FROM OTHER

01:56:18.271 --> 01:56:20.640
THAT IT'S A TRANSFORMATIVE LAW.

01:56:20.707 --> 01:56:21.574

01:56:21.641 --> 01:56:23.343
CHALLENGES IN IMPLEMENTATION AND

01:56:23.409 --> 01:56:26.212
THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WORKING

THAT A- HAVING STUDIES

01:56:53.773 --> 01:56:56.943
REASONABLE AND WE THINK THAT THE

PROPOSED GRANT PROGRAM COULD BE

01:56:58.544 --> 01:57:00.012

WAITING TO BE HEARD INCOME WHICH

02:12:17.529 --> 02:12:19.998
WOULD ALLOW US TO CREATE PRETTY

02:12:20.065 --> 02:12:22.367
CLOSE TO TWO TO THREE MILLION

02:12:22.434 --> 02:12:26.271

ONE OF OUR COMMUNITIES. BUT THIS

02:12:33.445 --> 02:12:36.114
REALLY- THIS REALLY AFFECTS THE

02:12:36.181 --> 02:12:39.017
WAY BEYOND THAT- AND ANNA IT

LISTENING TO PEOPLE SPEAK THAT.

02:12:41.953 --> 02:12:44.156

IS YOU MAY NEVER VISIT ANY OF

02:12:46.191 --> 02:12:47.259
THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

02:12:47.326 --> 02:12:49.828
DESPERATE FOR HOUSING. ARE VERY

02:12:49.895 --> 02:12:52.931
POOR LOCATED RURAL CALIFORNIA

STORES AND PHARMACIES IN THE

02:13:02.307 --> 02:13:07.846
KINDS OF AMENITY. ONE EIGHT

02:13:07.913 --> 02:13:09.881
COMMUNITY THEY- THEN YOU. BUT

02:13:09.948 --> 02:13:11.917
EVERYTHING THERE SO THAT YOU

02:13:11.983 --> 02:13:14.019
FIND- AND SO MAYBE WHAT WE NEED

02:13:14.086 --> 02:13:15.554
TO DO IS ORGANIZE A TRIP

PEOPLE COULD SEE- THAT THE- AND

02:13:24.162 --> 02:13:25.964
TALK TO THE ELECTED OFFICIALS SO

02:13:26.031 --> 02:13:28.400

GROUP- ARRAY OF PEOPLE THAT THE

02:13:35.374 --> 02:13:37.109
FIRST. JEWELS THAT BROUGHT THE

02:13:37.175 --> 02:13:38.276
IS. IT'S BECAUSE HE SAID WE WANT

02:13:38.343 --> 02:13:40.212
TO BUILD WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

02:13:40.278 --> 02:13:42.381
CHANGE OUR- OUR METHODOLOGY AND

02:13:42.447 --> 02:13:44.216
THIS IS REALLY HARD ON OUR

02:13:44.282 --> 02:13:45.851
COMMUNITY SINCE I STARTED ASKING

02:13:45.917 --> 02:13:47.786
WHAT IS THE COST SAN DIEGO CAME

02:13:47.853 --> 02:13:50.489
OUT WITH THAT THE COST FIRST AND

02:13:50.555 --> 02:13:51.790
YOUR FIRST KNOWS WORKING ON

02:13:51.857 --> 02:13:53.625
THEIRS RIGHT NOW WE SPEAK AND

02:13:53.692 --> 02:13:55.227
THERE'S A COST TO CHANGING THE

02:13:55.293 --> 02:13:58.397
METHODOLOGY- BUT THE REAL ISSUE

02:13:58.463 --> 02:14:00.265
IS IT IT IT'S GOING TO HAVE A

02:14:00.332 --> 02:14:02.100
BIG A BIG IMPACT ON THE SMALLER

02:14:02.167 --> 02:14:03.502
COMMUNITY THAT BETTER LOOKING

02:14:03.568 --> 02:14:04.302
FOR HOUSING AND HAVE THE

02:14:04.369 --> 02:14:05.871
CAPABILITY. FOR YOU CAN STILL

02:14:05.937 --> 02:14:07.172
BUY AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THOSE

02:14:07.239 --> 02:14:09.574
COMMUNITIES- AND THAT'S WHAT

02:14:09.641 --> 02:14:11.410
THAT'S REALLY WHAT I'M CONCERNED

02:14:11.476 --> 02:14:13.578
ABOUT AND- WE STUCK WITH THE

02:14:13.645 --> 02:14:17.416
ORIGINAL TENT OF THE OF A BILL

02:14:17.482 --> 02:14:19.317
WHICH WOULD CEASE IT SAID AREAS

02:14:19.384 --> 02:14:23.054
- YEAH WE EXPECT IT TO S. T. HI

02:14:23.121 --> 02:14:28.727
TRANSIT AUTHORITY AREAS AT. I

02:14:28.794 --> 02:14:30.061
POINT. THE WENT IT ALL CENTER

02:14:30.128 --> 02:14:31.163
BECAUSE ABSOLUTE RIGHT JUST

02:14:31.229 --> 02:14:32.798
DOESN'T IT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

02:14:32.864 --> 02:14:34.433
FIND THE SWEET SPOT I APPRECIATE

02:14:34.499 --> 02:14:36.435
THE CHAIR- HIS HIS HIS COMMENTS

02:14:36.501 --> 02:14:38.637
AND- INTEREST IN WORKING WITH ME

02:14:38.703 --> 02:14:39.571
GETTING GROUPS TOGETHER TO

02:14:39.638 --> 02:14:41.440
FIGURE THIS OUT BECAUSE I THINK

02:14:41.506 --> 02:14:43.809
THEY'RE THERE IS A NEED FOR US

02:14:43.875 --> 02:14:45.977
TO LOOK AT THIS AND IF IT IS. IT

02:14:46.044 --> 02:14:51.483
WAS ONLY IF DOING VMT MEANT THAT

02:14:51.550 --> 02:14:53.919
OTHER COMMUNITIES WOULDN'T SEND

02:14:53.985 --> 02:14:55.620
THEIR RESIDENTS. TO OUR TO OUR

02:14:55.687 --> 02:14:57.789
COMMUNITIES AND WE CAN BUILD FOR

02:14:57.856 --> 02:15:00.258
OUR OWN. I'D BE FAT DUMB AND

02:15:00.325 --> 02:15:01.827
HAPPY I MEAN I JUST BE HAPPY THE

02:15:01.893 --> 02:15:04.796
PROBLEM IS THAT WHEN WE BUILD

02:15:04.863 --> 02:15:07.566
HOUSING- IT ATTRACTS PEOPLE TO

02:15:07.632 --> 02:15:10.101
COME FROM AREAS THAT WERE THERE

02:15:10.168 --> 02:15:12.070
NOT BUILDING HOUSING RIGHT AND

02:15:12.137 --> 02:15:15.106
SO. I YOU KNOW I'M I'M I

02:15:15.173 --> 02:15:17.375
STRUGGLE BECAUSE- I REALLY DO

02:15:17.442 --> 02:15:20.812
WANT. THESE COMMUNITIES. TO GROW

02:15:20.879 --> 02:15:22.147
BECAUSE WHEN AFTER TALKED TO THE

02:15:22.214 --> 02:15:23.381
RETAILERS THEY SAY WERE WILLING

02:15:23.448 --> 02:15:25.250
TO GO IN BUT THEY NEED MORE

02:15:25.317 --> 02:15:26.852
HOUSING YOU HAVE TO HAVE MORE

02:15:26.918 --> 02:15:28.720
PEOPLE LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY FOR

02:15:28.787 --> 02:15:30.422
US TO BE THERE. AND- AND SO IS

02:15:30.489 --> 02:15:32.224
THE CHICKEN AND EGG THING HOW DO

02:15:32.290 --> 02:15:34.926
WE GET THERE HOW DO WE- HOW DO

02:15:34.993 --> 02:15:36.495
WE REALLY REDUCE GREENHOUSE

02:15:36.561 --> 02:15:38.663
GASES BUT WE DO IT IN A WAY

02:15:38.730 --> 02:15:39.865
WHERE PEOPLE WERE COMMUNITIES

02:15:39.931 --> 02:15:40.765
ARE ACTUALLY BUILDING HOUSING

02:15:40.832 --> 02:15:45.370
FOR THE JOB. CREATING AND THAT

02:15:45.437 --> 02:15:47.105
THAT GOES BEYOND THIS BILL BUT

02:15:47.172 --> 02:15:49.875
SOMEHOW WE NEED TO TALK. TO GET

02:15:49.941 --> 02:15:52.077

WHEN THEY SAY IT THE BE. THE

02:15:57.115 --> 02:15:58.783
IMPACT ON GREENHOUSE GASES IS

02:15:58.850 --> 02:16:00.752
GOING TO BE MINUSCULE. IN

02:16:00.819 --> 02:16:03.722
COMPARISON TO THE COST- CAN

02:16:03.788 --> 02:16:05.690
BUILD A HOUSE IN THAT. COST THEN

02:16:05.757 --> 02:16:07.125
GETS TRANSLATED INTO THE

02:16:07.192 --> 02:16:08.760

02:35:14.705 --> 02:35:17.074
REFINERIES ACROSS THE STATE. WE

02:35:17.141 --> 02:35:18.509
KNOW FROM RECENT LEGISLATIVE

02:35:18.575 --> 02:35:20.277
OVERSIGHT HEARINGS. AND EXPERT

02:35:20.344 --> 02:35:22.046
ADVISORY REPORTS THAT

02:35:22.112 --> 02:35:23.580
CALIFORNIA'S CAP AND TRADE

02:35:23.647 --> 02:35:25.382
PROGRAM HAS TOO MANY ALLOWANCES

02:35:25.449 --> 02:35:27.284
AND CARBON OFFSETS THAT IT'S TOO

02:35:27.351 --> 02:35:29.186
EASY FOR BIG POLLUTERS TO

02:35:29.253 --> 02:35:31.055
CONTINUE BUSINESS AS USUAL.

02:35:31.121 --> 02:35:32.923
WORSE MANY OF THESE ASSETS

02:35:32.990 --> 02:35:34.124
AREN'T DELIVERING CLIMATE

02:35:34.191 --> 02:35:36.326
BENEFITS. WHAT THAT MEANS ON THE

02:35:36.393 --> 02:35:38.262
GROUND IS THAT YOUNG KIDS LIVING

02:35:38.328 --> 02:35:39.830
NEAR REFINERIES ARE GETTING

02:35:39.897 --> 02:35:41.932
ASTHMA MORE OFTEN. AND THEIR

02:35:41.999 --> 02:35:44.034
FAMILIES ARE TAKING THEM TO THE

02:35:44.101 --> 02:35:45.936
EMERGENCY ROOM MORE OFTEN.

02:35:46.003 --> 02:35:47.204
MEANWHILE THE BURDEN OF AIR

02:35:47.271 --> 02:35:48.605
POLLUTION FROM FACILITIES

02:35:48.672 --> 02:35:50.507
SUBJECT TO CAP AND TRADE

02:35:50.574 --> 02:35:50.908
CONTINUES TO FALL

02:35:50.974 --> 02:35:51.775
DISPROPORTIONATELY ON

02:35:51.842 --> 02:35:53.877
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. MY BILL

02:35:53.944 --> 02:35:55.279
WOULD HELP ADDRESS THESE

02:35:55.345 --> 02:35:56.947
INJUSTICES WITH A SET OF

02:35:57.014 --> 02:35:58.982
PRACTICAL REFORMS FOR THE CAP

02:35:59.049 --> 02:36:01.251
AND TRADE PROGRAM. WE KNOW THAT

02:36:01.318 --> 02:36:03.387
THE R. WANTS TO LINK ITS PROGRAM

02:36:03.454 --> 02:36:04.588
WITH A SIMILAR PROGRAM THAT'S

02:36:04.655 --> 02:36:06.356
UNDER DEVELOPMENT IN WASHINGTON

02:36:06.423 --> 02:36:09.359
STATE. I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT

02:36:09.426 --> 02:36:10.494
WASHINGTON LEGISLATORS HAVE

02:36:10.561 --> 02:36:12.629
STUDIED OUR PROGRAM CLOSELY IN

02:36:12.696 --> 02:36:14.064
THEIR BILL SPONSOR FORMER

02:36:14.131 --> 02:36:16.233
SENATOR CARLYLE. SAID THAT HE

02:36:16.300 --> 02:36:18.736
POURED OVER CRITICAL REPORTS AND

02:36:18.802 --> 02:36:21.405
CALIFORNIA'S PROGRAM IN DRAFTING

02:36:21.472 --> 02:36:23.107
THEIR LAW. AND THEY DECIDED TO

02:36:23.173 --> 02:36:24.875
DO SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT

02:36:24.942 --> 02:36:27.277
FOR PEOPLE LIVING NEXT TO MAJOR

02:36:27.344 --> 02:36:29.079
POLLUTERS. IN CALIFORNIA WE LET

02:36:29.146 --> 02:36:30.514
THESE COMPANIES INCREASED AIR

02:36:30.581 --> 02:36:31.982
POLLUTION WHATEVER THEY CLAIM

02:36:32.049 --> 02:36:33.250
CARBON OFFSETS CREDITS FROM

02:36:33.317 --> 02:36:35.486
EXTRA CARBON SUPPOSEDLY STORED

02:36:35.552 --> 02:36:37.988
IN A TREE OR METHANE THAT'S NOT

02:36:38.055 --> 02:36:40.524
EMITTED FROM A COAL MINE. THE

02:36:40.591 --> 02:36:41.725
WASHINGTON POLICY DECIDED THAT

02:36:41.792 --> 02:36:43.427
THE USE OF CARBON OFFSETS WON'T

02:36:43.494 --> 02:36:44.795
EXPAND THE TOTAL POLLUTION

02:36:44.862 --> 02:36:46.897
ALLOWED IN THEIR PROGRAM THEY

02:36:46.964 --> 02:36:49.466
WON'T LET OFFSET'S OUTSOURCE THE

02:36:49.533 --> 02:36:52.970
HARD WORK OF CLEANING UP THE AIR

02:36:53.036 --> 02:36:55.339
. MY BILL AT THE THIRTEEN NINETY

02:36:55.405 --> 02:36:56.907
ONE WANTS TO BRING THE LESSONS

02:36:56.974 --> 02:36:58.709
WASHINGTON LEARN FROM CALIFORNIA

02:36:58.776 --> 02:37:00.978
BACK TO CALIFORNIA. IT WOULD

02:37:01.044 --> 02:37:02.546
CREATE TWO REQUIREMENTS THAT

02:37:02.613 --> 02:37:03.947
MUST BE MET BEFORE THEY ARE

02:37:04.014 --> 02:37:05.716
FORMALLY LINKS ITS PROGRAM WITH

02:37:05.783 --> 02:37:07.684
THE PROGRAM IN ANOTHER STATE

02:37:07.751 --> 02:37:10.154
FIRST. I WOULD NEED TO DO A

02:37:10.220 --> 02:37:12.089
REGULATORY CHECK UP ON THE CAP

02:37:12.156 --> 02:37:14.258
AND TRADE PROGRAM AT LEAST ONCE

02:37:14.324 --> 02:37:16.860
IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS. THIS IS

02:37:16.927 --> 02:37:18.495
A REASONABLE ASK IT'S BEEN MORE

02:37:18.562 --> 02:37:20.430
THAN FOUR YEARS SINCE THE LAST

02:37:20.497 --> 02:37:22.466
CHECKUP AND DESPITE EVIDENCE

OPPOSITION TO THE BILL- WE PUT

THE BILL MAKES IT HARDER TO LINK

02:43:09.279 --> 02:43:11.047
WHICH IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE

02:43:11.114 --> 02:43:12.949
GIVING OUT LINKING. CAN INCREASE

02:43:13.016 --> 02:43:16.520

ON TO CALIFORNIA. MY VIEW IS

02:43:27.998 --> 02:43:31.334
THAT- THE DECISION OF WHETHER TO

THE ONE PROPOSED IN THIS BILL

02:43:38.909 --> 02:43:41.244

BETTER VERSED ON THIS BUT- IS

02:44:33.430 --> 02:44:37.734
THERE. WHAT WHAT PREVENTS THE

AIRBOARD FROM DOING THIS UNDER

02:44:39.135 --> 02:44:41.338
EXISTING LAW IS THERE ANYTHING

02:44:41.404 --> 02:44:42.405
THAT PREVENTS THE AIR RESOURCES

02:44:42.472 --> 02:44:43.640
BOARD FROM. ALSO MY

02:44:43.707 --> 02:44:45.609
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE IS

02:44:45.675 --> 02:44:47.110
AND THEY JUST HAPPENED. THIS

02:44:47.177 --> 02:44:50.513
WOULD FORCE THEM TO. THEY COULD

02:44:50.580 --> 02:44:56.753
UNDER EXISTING LAW. OKAY- YEAH I

02:44:56.820 --> 02:44:58.355
MEAN MY CONCERN ABOUT THE

02:44:58.421 --> 02:45:02.359
MEASURE. I THE IDEA OF HAVING

02:45:02.425 --> 02:45:04.961
FORMAL REGULATION REVIEW SEEMS.

02:45:05.028 --> 02:45:07.964
STRAIGHTFORWARD ONE- WE KNOW

02:45:08.031 --> 02:45:09.566
THAT THERE ARE SORT OF

02:45:09.633 --> 02:45:10.400
STRUGGLING POLITICAL EFFORTS

02:45:10.467 --> 02:45:11.201
GOING ON IN MANY OTHER

02:45:11.268 --> 02:45:12.235
JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE OF

02:45:12.302 --> 02:45:13.403
CALIFORNIA THE DON'T HAVE CAP

02:45:13.470 --> 02:45:15.138
AND TRADE PROGRAMS OR ANY MARKET

02:45:15.205 --> 02:45:17.674
BASED MECHANISMS I MEAN REGGIE

02:45:17.741 --> 02:45:20.910
ON THE NORTHEAST THIS IS- REALLY

02:45:20.977 --> 02:45:22.445
HARD. REALLY HARD SLOGS FOR

02:45:22.512 --> 02:45:23.947
STATES LIKE PENNSYLVANIA TO GET

02:45:24.014 --> 02:45:26.983
INVOLVED AND- AND OTHERS SO MY

02:45:27.050 --> 02:45:28.551
CONCERN IS THAT. I DON'T WANT

02:45:28.618 --> 02:45:30.520
TO. PUT ANY DETERRENT IN STATE

02:45:30.587 --> 02:45:32.455
LAW FOR SAY A BRIEF STATE LIKE

02:45:32.522 --> 02:45:34.124
PENNSYLVANIA THAT'S GOING TO.

02:45:34.190 --> 02:45:37.927
TRY TO PUT TO. PUT SOME KIND OF

02:45:37.994 --> 02:45:39.062
CARBON MARKET TOGETHER BUT THEY-

02:45:39.129 --> 02:45:43.566
WERE SAYING- WAIT FOR WE'RE NOT

02:45:43.633 --> 02:45:45.568
GONNA LINK WITH YOU- OR WE'RE

02:45:45.635 --> 02:45:46.803
GONNA PUT THIS PUBLIC

02:45:46.870 --> 02:45:49.272
CONSULTATION PROCESS. IN PLACE

02:45:49.339 --> 02:45:54.344
WITH. I. E. MAC- AND SORT OF.

02:45:54.411 --> 02:45:56.046
PUT THEM THROUGH THE WRINGER AS

02:45:56.112 --> 02:45:57.480
IT WERE WHEN IF THEY'RE WILLING

02:45:57.547 --> 02:46:00.183
TO STEP OUT AND MAKE SOME TOUGH

02:46:00.250 --> 02:46:01.151
DECISIONS I GET WHAT'S GOING ON

02:46:01.217 --> 02:46:04.187
WASHINGTON- STATE AND IF THEY'RE

02:46:04.254 --> 02:46:08.491
TAKING CHANCES. THERE TO- BUT

02:46:08.558 --> 02:46:12.929
BUT THE PROVISION THAT ACTUALLY

02:46:12.996 --> 02:46:15.231
IT'S IN AND MICROMANAGES HOW THE

02:46:15.298 --> 02:46:16.833
AIR BOARD REDUCES THE NUMBER OF

02:46:16.900 --> 02:46:19.269
EMISSIONS ALLOWANCE BASED ON THE

02:46:19.336 --> 02:46:21.137
NUMBER OF OFFSETS INVOLVED IN

02:46:21.204 --> 02:46:22.939
LINKAGE I THINK WE'RE SORT OF

02:46:23.006 --> 02:46:25.375
CONFLATING LINKAGE AND OFFSETS

02:46:25.442 --> 02:46:28.011
TO THOSE ARE DIFFERENT THINGS WE

02:46:28.078 --> 02:46:29.012
TAKE OFFSETS FROM OTHER

02:46:29.079 --> 02:46:30.413
JURISDICTIONS BUT- MY

02:46:30.480 --> 02:46:31.815
UNDERSTANDING IS LINKAGE HAS TO

02:46:31.881 --> 02:46:34.017
DO WITH THE ACTUAL ALLOWING

02:46:34.084 --> 02:46:37.187
MARK. SO MUCH THE OFFSETS. I'M

02:46:37.253 --> 02:46:39.589
ALWAYS HESITANT TO DO VERY

02:46:39.656 --> 02:46:45.095
NARROW- TINKERING WITH. A REALLY

02:46:45.161 --> 02:46:47.964
IMPORTANT STATUTE THAT HAS HUGE

02:46:48.031 --> 02:46:49.466
MARKET IMPLICATIONS AND WHAT

02:46:49.532 --> 02:46:51.301
THIS MIGHT DO TO THE MARKET

02:46:51.368 --> 02:46:54.838
PLACE RIGHT NOW IF WE- IF WE TO

02:46:54.904 --> 02:46:57.040
PASS THIS SO I GET THE PEOPLE OF

02:46:57.107 --> 02:46:59.476
YES WITHOUT THE CURRENT PROGRAM

02:46:59.542 --> 02:47:00.510
MR NINE HEARD YOUR LEAD WITNESS

02:47:00.577 --> 02:47:01.911
AND I KNOW HE'S HAD ONGOING

02:47:01.978 --> 02:47:03.079
ISSUES WITH THE CAP AND TRADE

02:47:03.146 --> 02:47:05.281
PROGRAM AND WE HEAR HIM LOUD AND

02:47:05.348 --> 02:47:07.450
CLEAR THAT. BUT I GUESS

02:47:07.517 --> 02:47:10.820
I'M JUST I'M CONCERNED THAT

02:47:10.887 --> 02:47:13.189
PICKING THIS NARROW APPROACH AND

02:47:13.256 --> 02:47:15.191
DECIDING WHAT THAT IS NOW THAT

02:47:15.258 --> 02:47:16.726
WE COULD PROBABLY DEAL BETTER

02:47:16.793 --> 02:47:18.428
WITH THAT THROUGH THE SCOPING

02:47:18.495 --> 02:47:22.298
PLAN- AND ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE

02:47:22.365 --> 02:47:24.334
DEALT WITH SOME OF THIS IN AB

02:47:24.401 --> 02:47:25.235
THREE NINETY EIGHT. I DON'T KNOW

02:47:25.301 --> 02:47:26.302
IF THE GOVERNOR IS NOT PUTTING

02:47:26.369 --> 02:47:27.904
ANY OF THESE CERTIFICATIONS IN

02:47:27.971 --> 02:47:30.473
WRITING OR FOR NOT BEFORE

02:47:30.540 --> 02:47:32.609
PROPOSING OVER THE LINK WITH

02:47:32.675 --> 02:47:35.078
FOLKS WHO HAVE NOT HAD A FORMAL

02:47:35.145 --> 02:47:40.216
REGULARLY REVIEW. BUT YEAH I

02:47:40.283 --> 02:47:41.651
JUST FEEL WOULD PROBLEM WE'RE

02:47:41.718 --> 02:47:43.019
TRYING TO SOLVE HERE OTHER THAN.

02:47:43.086 --> 02:47:45.388
TRY TO FOR THE AIRPORTS- SO.

02:47:45.455 --> 02:47:47.257
THAT'S MY CONCERN RIGHT NOW BUT

02:47:47.323 --> 02:47:49.859
I'M HAPPY IF YOU WANT TO RESPOND

02:47:49.926 --> 02:47:50.960

HAPPY TO HEAR SOME FEEDBACK. I'M

02:47:55.064 --> 02:47:56.599
JUST GENERALLY RECOVER. IN A

02:47:56.666 --> 02:47:57.867
MARKET THAT'S A MULTI BILLION

02:47:57.934 --> 02:48:00.370
DOLLAR CARBON MARKET WITH GLOBAL

02:48:00.437 --> 02:48:02.338
IMPLICATIONS THAT WE WANT A

02:48:02.405 --> 02:48:04.040
STABLE AS POSSIBLE ANYTHING THAT

02:48:04.107 --> 02:48:06.643
DESTABILIZES THAT OR IN ANYWAY

02:48:06.709 --> 02:48:07.377
PUTS A WALL UP AROUND

02:48:07.444 --> 02:48:09.479
CALIFORNIA. AND SAYS WE'RE NOT

02:48:09.546 --> 02:48:10.146
INTERESTED IN LINKING WITH OTHER

02:48:10.213 --> 02:48:13.383
JURISDICTIONS THAT. I WANT TO

02:48:13.450 --> 02:48:15.752
SHARE AND I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW.

02:48:15.819 --> 02:48:17.687
ANYWAY THAT THAT'S WHAT'S THAT'S

02:48:17.754 --> 02:48:18.855
MY QUICK REACTION BUT MAYBE I

02:48:18.922 --> 02:48:20.657
MAYBE MISSED READING THIS AND

02:48:20.723 --> 02:48:21.991
OVERSTATING IT SO I'M I'M I'M

02:48:22.058 --> 02:48:24.727
HAPPY TO BE- DISSUADED OR OR

02:48:24.794 --> 02:48:26.830
WRONG. AT THAT'S THAT'S THE

02:48:26.896 --> 02:48:28.498
CONCERN THIS POINT. OKAY GREAT I

02:48:28.565 --> 02:48:31.000
WOULD LOVE TO HAVE MY LEAD

02:48:31.067 --> 02:48:36.172
WITNESS RESPOND. YES I THINK TO

02:48:36.239 --> 02:48:38.274
- CENTER STERN CORPS QUESTION I

02:48:38.341 --> 02:48:39.309
WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE BILL

02:48:39.375 --> 02:48:41.411
WAS DRAFTED DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY

02:48:41.478 --> 02:48:43.346
ACTION FROM THE AIRPORT SO ONE

02:48:43.413 --> 02:48:45.281
OF THE OPTIONS THE AIRPORT COULD

02:48:45.348 --> 02:48:47.050
TAKE. TAKE NO ACTION AGAINST ME

02:48:47.116 --> 02:48:48.384
THE PROGRAM EXACTLY AS A

02:48:48.451 --> 02:48:50.286
SUSPENDED FINE ORDER FOR THAT

02:48:50.353 --> 02:48:52.789
HARD TO BE LIKE THE REQUIREMENTS

02:48:52.856 --> 02:48:55.592
THE BILL WITH APPLY IF AND ONLY

02:48:55.658 --> 02:48:56.226
THAT IF THE BOARD WANTS TO MAKE

02:48:56.292 --> 02:48:58.328
A NEW BIKE HELMET JURISDICTION

02:48:58.394 --> 02:49:00.363
OF THAT IS MOST APPROXIMATELY IN

02:49:00.430 --> 02:49:01.931
UNDER POTENTIAL CONSIDERATION

02:49:01.998 --> 02:49:03.032
WITH WASHINGTON STATE AND THE

02:49:03.099 --> 02:49:04.701
LONG SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE IN THE

02:49:04.767 --> 02:49:06.803
MARKET ROLES WOULD BE TO ADOPT

02:49:06.870 --> 02:49:08.471
PROTECTION WASHINGTON IS ALREADY

02:49:08.538 --> 02:49:10.874
REQUIRED TO. SO THOSE ARE

02:49:10.940 --> 02:49:13.343
CHANGES I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR

02:49:13.409 --> 02:49:14.944
ABOUT THAT BUT THAT IT'S

02:49:15.011 --> 02:49:19.616
BASICALLY BRINGING CAL.

02:49:19.682 --> 02:49:22.218
WASHINGTON OKAY AND ONE OF THE

02:49:22.285 --> 02:49:24.087
OP BEFORE WOULD PREFER ON THE

02:49:24.153 --> 02:49:26.055
BILL THE IT IS TO TAKE NOT AT

02:49:26.122 --> 02:49:29.526
ALL SO IF THE BOARD WERE TO SAY

02:49:29.592 --> 02:49:30.560
RIGHT DIRECTION WANTED TO THEY

02:49:30.627 --> 02:49:31.861
CAN CONTINUE THE ONE THAT THE

02:49:31.928 --> 02:49:33.796
CURRENT OFF BUT BE ELIGIBLE TO

02:49:33.863 --> 02:49:36.833
MAKE A WITHIN PROGRAM IN THAT

02:49:36.900 --> 02:49:39.035
INSTANCE I'M- BUT IF ANOTHER

02:49:39.102 --> 02:49:45.041
STATE WANTS TO OUT. AND OCT. LAN

02:49:45.108 --> 02:49:46.276
FROM AND I MEANT PENNSYLVANIA

02:49:46.342 --> 02:49:47.911
BECAUSE THAT THAT GUY IS BRAVE

02:49:47.977 --> 02:49:49.779
VETOED A OF ITS IN THE STATE

02:49:49.846 --> 02:49:51.347
LEGISLATURE TO BLOCK THEM FROM

02:49:51.414 --> 02:49:52.649
JOINING THE REGIONAL GREENHOUSE

02:49:52.715 --> 02:49:54.484
GAS INITIATIVE IN THE NORTHEAST

02:49:54.551 --> 02:49:56.686
BUT IF WE WANTED TO REWARD THAT

02:49:56.753 --> 02:49:58.288
KIND OF CLIMATE BRAVERY ON THE

02:49:58.354 --> 02:50:00.557
EAST COAST AND LOOK AT LINKAGES

02:50:00.623 --> 02:50:03.293
THERE. WE'VE NOW DESIGNED OF

02:50:03.359 --> 02:50:05.662
THIS SORT OF PRECONDITION AROUND

02:50:05.728 --> 02:50:10.600
A WASHINGTON. PARITY IDEA BUT-

02:50:10.667 --> 02:50:12.368
ARE WE BUSY LOCKING THE AIRPORT

02:50:12.435 --> 02:50:14.270
INTO TRYING TO FIND PARITY WITH

02:50:14.337 --> 02:50:16.072
THE WITH ONE JURISDICTION BUT

02:50:16.139 --> 02:50:17.540
THEN IF ANOTHER JURISDICTION HAD

02:50:17.607 --> 02:50:19.309
A DIFFERENT SORT OF FRAMEWORK

02:50:19.375 --> 02:50:21.411
WOULD IT. WOULD PRECLUDE US IT

02:50:21.477 --> 02:50:22.245
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE SAYING IT

02:50:22.312 --> 02:50:24.447
WOULD PRECLUDE US FROM LOOKING

02:50:24.514 --> 02:50:26.883
WITH THAT JURISDICTION- I

02:50:26.950 --> 02:50:28.318
BELIEVE IT WOULD ALTHOUGH I

02:50:28.384 --> 02:50:30.453
THINK IT'S WORTH POINTING OUT

02:50:30.520 --> 02:50:31.588
THAT THE EAST COAST

02:50:31.654 --> 02:50:32.121
RESTRICTIONS. LEVINE AND

02:50:32.188 --> 02:50:34.223
PARTICIPATED IN A MARKET THAT I

02:50:34.290 --> 02:50:35.625
THINK IS UNLIKELY TO BE LINKABLE

02:50:35.692 --> 02:50:37.126
UNDER CURRENT MARKET STANDARDS

02:50:37.193 --> 02:50:38.595
IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT STRUCTURE.

02:50:38.661 --> 02:50:40.863
I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY OTHER

02:50:40.930 --> 02:50:42.432
JURISDICTION THAT IS PRETTY FAR

02:50:42.498 --> 02:50:43.399
ALONG IN THE CONVERSATION OTHER

02:50:43.466 --> 02:50:45.568
THAN CALIFORNIA AND WASHINGTON

02:50:45.635 --> 02:50:47.170
TO AN ECONOMY WIDE PROGRAM LIKE

02:50:47.236 --> 02:50:48.871
THAT SO I. WOULD ABSOLUTELY

02:50:48.938 --> 02:50:52.475
CORRECT. AND I. I MIGHT SUGGEST

02:50:52.542 --> 02:50:54.077
THAT HAS LIMITED THE FACT BUT-

02:50:54.143 --> 02:50:59.282
THAT'S DENIED OLDER. FOR THANKS

02:50:59.349 --> 02:51:01.284
. WHAT THE MEAT FROM DOCTOR WHAT

02:51:01.351 --> 02:51:04.954
WITH SO YOU I'M ADDRESS THE

02:51:05.021 --> 02:51:07.624
BROADER THE BROADER CONCERNS

02:51:07.690 --> 02:51:08.725
BEING RAISED BY CENTER STERN

02:51:08.791 --> 02:51:11.227
WHICH IS. WHY WOULD WE WANT TO

02:51:11.294 --> 02:51:14.197
HARM OUR ABILITY TO. I HAD TO IT

02:51:14.263 --> 02:51:16.799
TOOK TO LINK WITH STATES THAT

02:51:16.866 --> 02:51:20.236
ARE REALLY STEPPING UP. WHAT

02:51:20.303 --> 02:51:22.005
SENATOR I THINK AGAIN THERE ARE

02:51:22.071 --> 02:51:24.574
MAKING PROVISION IN THE END OF

02:51:24.641 --> 02:51:26.042
STATE LAW RIGHT NOW THAT REQUIRE

02:51:26.109 --> 02:51:27.110
US TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE LINKED

02:51:27.176 --> 02:51:28.244
INTO COMPARABLY AMBITIOUS

02:51:28.311 --> 02:51:30.480
PROGRAMS. SUPPORT STANDARD RT

02:51:30.546 --> 02:51:33.082
EXISTENCE LONG AND I THINK

02:51:33.149 --> 02:51:33.950
THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN A

02:51:34.017 --> 02:51:35.551
CONSIDERATION THAT WERE SUPPOSED

02:51:35.618 --> 02:51:37.387
TO BE WORKING WITH JURISDICTIONS

02:51:37.453 --> 02:51:39.389
THAT HAVE AGAIN COMPARABLY FISH

02:51:39.455 --> 02:51:44.160
PROGRAMS. THE WASHINGTON. MORE

02:51:44.227 --> 02:51:47.397
THAN OURS IS GOOD- FOR MIKE OF

02:51:47.463 --> 02:51:49.365
VIEW- I THINK THE PRODUCT IS DO

02:51:49.432 --> 02:51:51.100
WE WANT TO HAVE A PROGRAM THAT

02:51:51.167 --> 02:51:52.835
WORKS WELL IF WE WANT TO FOCUS

02:51:52.902 --> 02:51:55.838
ON THE DINING OUT OF HOME OR WE

02:51:55.905 --> 02:51:57.173
MORE INTERESTED IN COLLECTING

02:51:57.240 --> 02:52:01.244
LOOKING EXPERIENCES AND- TRYING

02:52:01.310 --> 02:52:02.245
TO GET THE PROGRAM UNDER. WITH

02:52:02.311 --> 02:52:04.180
CLEAR TO FIND WHAT IT'S GOING TO

02:52:04.247 --> 02:52:06.749
IT A HIGHER PRIORITY THAN THIS

02:52:06.816 --> 02:52:07.483
WOULD BE I THINK THE WAY TO

02:52:07.550 --> 02:52:09.118
ENCOURAGE THAT. BUT CAN I TAKE

02:52:09.185 --> 02:52:10.720
YOUR POINT IF THE PRIMARY GOAL

02:52:10.787 --> 02:52:12.021
IS TO LINK WITH A MATTER OF

02:52:12.088 --> 02:52:13.156
MONTHS FORWARD. INCREASING

02:52:13.222 --> 02:52:14.424
STANDARDS FOR LINKING WILL

02:52:14.490 --> 02:52:15.591
NECESSARILY DISLIKE THAT. BABY

02:52:15.658 --> 02:52:18.161
YOU YOU FEEL- BUT YOU FELT YOU

02:52:18.227 --> 02:52:19.495
FEEL PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT A

02:52:19.562 --> 02:52:23.299
STRONG PROGRAM. LIKE

02:52:23.366 --> 02:52:24.133
WASHINGTON'S WILL NOT BE. I

02:52:24.200 --> 02:52:26.836
SUBSTANTIVELY. BY THIS BILL THEY

02:52:26.903 --> 02:52:30.073
ARE BILLING TO MY ATTENTION. MY

02:52:30.139 --> 02:52:31.507
EDUCATION TO REQUIREMENTS THE

02:52:31.574 --> 02:52:33.543
PROCEDURAL CHECKUPS THE AIRPORT

02:52:33.609 --> 02:52:34.944
WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE

02:52:35.011 --> 02:52:36.512
REGULATORY PROCESS HERE IN

02:52:36.579 --> 02:52:38.281
CALIFORNIA PRIOR TO THE LINK AND

02:52:38.347 --> 02:52:39.282
THE CHANGES IN THE SECOND

02:52:39.348 --> 02:52:41.217
REQUIREMENT WOULD BE TO MATCH

02:52:41.284 --> 02:52:42.752
THE WASHINGTON STATE COACH

02:52:42.819 --> 02:52:44.320
WASHINGTON STATE BECAUSE IT'S

02:52:44.387 --> 02:52:46.189
ALREADY HAPPENED APPROACHES

02:52:46.255 --> 02:52:48.357
BECAUSE STATURE PARTY REQUIRES

02:52:48.424 --> 02:52:51.027
THE SAME KIND OF. SURE THAT

02:52:51.094 --> 02:52:52.361
WOULD BE MY INTERPRETATION OF

02:52:52.428 --> 02:52:55.965
THE AND DRAFTED. OKAY- CENTER

02:52:56.032 --> 02:53:00.336

BILL BECAUSE I LIKE THE BILL AND

02:53:02.605 --> 02:53:05.641
I WOULD INTERPRET ME FIRST SO

02:53:05.708 --> 02:53:07.944
EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS REGGIE ALL

02:53:08.010 --> 02:53:09.145
READ SHE DEALS WITH IS THE

02:53:09.212 --> 02:53:12.048
UTILITIES THEY DO NOT HAVE

02:53:12.115 --> 02:53:13.616
COVERED ENTITIES POWER PLANTS

02:53:13.683 --> 02:53:15.318
SIX ALL THE WITH THIS POWER

02:53:15.384 --> 02:53:17.620
PLANTS IT'S A MUCH SMALLER CAP

02:53:17.687 --> 02:53:23.659
AND TRADE PROGRAM IS TO SPEAK OF

02:53:23.726 --> 02:53:25.161
THEN WHAT WE'RE DOING SO. BUT

02:53:25.228 --> 02:53:27.296
BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY SO MANY.

02:53:27.363 --> 02:53:28.564
SOMEBODY- EMITTER CENTER

02:53:28.631 --> 02:53:30.600
ADMITTING IT SO IT'S AS MUCH

02:53:30.666 --> 02:53:32.668
SKINNIER LITTLE PROGRAM THAT WE

02:53:32.735 --> 02:53:35.304
HAVE WASHINGTONHAS COVERED

02:53:35.371 --> 02:53:37.240
ENTITIES LIKE WE'D GET THE

02:53:37.306 --> 02:53:39.909
LARGEST INDUSTRIAL EMITTERS THAT

02:53:39.976 --> 02:53:41.511
THEY HAVE AND WHAT THEY'VE

02:53:41.577 --> 02:53:43.646
DESIGNED IS A CAP AND INVEST

02:53:43.713 --> 02:53:45.648
PROGRAM IF REUVEN CARLYLE WERE

02:53:45.715 --> 02:53:48.417
HERE HE WOULD SAY IT'S NOT CAPEN

02:53:48.484 --> 02:53:49.285
TREE WE DON'T WANT YOU TO TRADE

02:53:49.352 --> 02:53:52.722
THESE ALLOWANCES WE WANT YOU TO

02:53:52.789 --> 02:53:54.524
INVEST AND THAT'S THE BEAUTY

02:53:54.590 --> 02:53:56.492
YOUR BILL. IS BEFORE YOU CAN

02:53:56.559 --> 02:53:58.661
OFFSET WHICH YES THE CARBON

02:53:58.728 --> 02:53:59.762
MARKETS THEY'RE OUT THERE

02:53:59.829 --> 02:54:01.030
THEY'RE LISTENING TO WHAT WE'RE

02:54:01.097 --> 02:54:04.200
GOING ON HERE YOU CAN'T TRIPS

02:54:04.267 --> 02:54:07.103
**** NILLY GET ALL. WITH AT YOU

02:54:07.170 --> 02:54:09.138
HAVE TO IN THE- YOUR FIX

02:54:09.205 --> 02:54:11.507
FACILITIES YOU DON'T GET AND IF

02:54:11.574 --> 02:54:14.210
YOU DON'T THEN YOU DON'T THAT'S

02:54:14.277 --> 02:54:16.078
WHAT THE MAP OF. STAFF REPORT

02:54:16.145 --> 02:54:17.947
ADEQUATELY EXPLAINS THAT YOU YOU

02:54:18.014 --> 02:54:21.284
HAVE ONLY GET A 5% LESSER 10%

02:54:21.350 --> 02:54:23.352
DEPENDING ON WHAT THE OFFSET IS

02:54:23.419 --> 02:54:25.988
OF YOU MEETING YOUR ALLOWANCES

02:54:26.055 --> 02:54:30.827
SO THIS PROGRAM WE DECIDED IN

02:54:30.893 --> 02:54:33.429
TWENTY TWELVE IT WAS NEVER

02:54:33.496 --> 02:54:34.230
SUPPOSED TO BE STATIC. AS I READ

02:54:34.297 --> 02:54:38.301
. I THINK THAT BOARD TO HAVE A

02:54:38.367 --> 02:54:40.736
FORMAL REGULATORY OF PROCESS

02:54:40.803 --> 02:54:44.874
ONCE WASHINGTON HAS PASSED YOUR

02:54:44.941 --> 02:54:46.843
BILL WHAT WE'RE AND WE'RE

02:54:46.909 --> 02:54:47.944
SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE LINKAGE

02:54:48.010 --> 02:54:49.445
BUSINESS SO THEY HAVE TO SIT

02:54:49.512 --> 02:54:51.414
DOWN AND SAY CAN WE LINK IT IN

02:54:51.480 --> 02:54:53.649
CAN WE NOT WE'RE NOT. IS SO IF

02:54:53.716 --> 02:54:55.918
IT IT WAS NEVER DESIGNED TO BE

02:54:55.985 --> 02:54:57.286
STATIC IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE

02:54:57.353 --> 02:55:01.357
EVOLVE AND IF YOU HAVE A BETTER

02:55:01.424 --> 02:55:02.491
CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. THAT SAYS

02:55:02.558 --> 02:55:05.928
YEAH NOT GOING. TO GIVE YOU A

02:55:05.995 --> 02:55:07.563
CREDIT ON THESE ALLOW ON THESE

02:55:07.630 --> 02:55:08.898
OFFSETS THAT YOU YOU'RE NOT

02:55:08.965 --> 02:55:10.833
REDUCING EMISSIONS UNLESS YOU

02:55:10.900 --> 02:55:12.368
ACTUALLY REDUCE EMISSIONS THEN

02:55:12.435 --> 02:55:15.104
WE- IT INCREASES OUR CLIMATE

02:55:15.171 --> 02:55:17.073
GOALS AND- SO WE GET MORE

02:55:17.139 --> 02:55:18.307
INFORMATION. THAT WE'RE NOT

02:55:18.374 --> 02:55:20.543
GOING TO MEET TWENTY THIRTY.

02:55:20.610 --> 02:55:21.677
MEASURES THEN YOU WOULD THINK

02:55:21.744 --> 02:55:24.614
YOU WANT TO TIGHTEN UP. THE BED

02:55:24.680 --> 02:55:29.418
I'M I THINK IT'S- HE. STROKE OF

02:55:29.485 --> 02:55:31.621
BRILLIANCE THAT YOU DIDN'T SET

02:55:31.687 --> 02:55:32.788
NEW STANDARDS BECAUSE I COULDN'T

03:06:05.988 --> 03:06:07.956
IN THAT. BABIES IN THE UNITED

03:06:08.023 --> 03:06:09.024
STATES HAVE THE HIGHEST

03:06:09.091 --> 03:06:10.392
CONCENTRATION OF THESE

03:06:10.459 --> 03:06:12.427
MICROFIBERS IN THERE YOU KNOW

03:06:12.494 --> 03:06:15.964
BAY BOTTLE IT JUST SAYS- WHEN HE

03:06:16.031 --> 03:06:19.635
CAUGHT- FORGET WHAT THAT TERM IS

03:06:19.701 --> 03:06:22.271
FOR WHEN. BODY DURING YOUR PRIME

03:06:22.337 --> 03:06:24.206
NUMBER BUT ANYWAY. AND NOW WE

03:06:24.273 --> 03:06:27.709
KNOW THAT IT IS A LOT FROM. IT

03:06:27.776 --> 03:06:30.012
IT'S NOT JUST THE BLANKETS OR

03:06:30.078 --> 03:06:32.414
THAT IT'S FROM ALL THESE

03:06:32.481 --> 03:06:34.449
CLOTHES. AND IT'S IN THE

03:06:34.516 --> 03:06:37.586
REMEMBER MEANT IT'S A PHYSICALLY

03:06:37.653 --> 03:06:39.388
IN US IT'S- YOU KNOW PRETTY SOON

03:06:39.454 --> 03:06:41.590
THEY SAY YOU'RE WHAT YOU'RE

03:06:41.657 --> 03:06:42.457
EATING. WE DON'T HAVE TO EAT IT

03:06:42.524 --> 03:06:44.293
WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO BE COMING

03:06:44.359 --> 03:06:45.928
WE'RE JUST BECAUSE WERE IN JUST

03:06:45.994 --> 03:06:47.763
WERE BRIEFING AT THE WHOLE BIT.

03:06:47.829 --> 03:06:49.264
ANYWAY SO THIS IS REALLY REALLY

03:06:49.331 --> 03:06:50.933
IMPORTANT BUT THE OTHER THING.

03:06:50.999 --> 03:06:53.769
THAT IT TO KERR TO ME THAT WE

03:06:53.835 --> 03:06:54.770
HAVE THESE GOALS NOW REGARDING

03:06:54.836 --> 03:06:57.706
DIVERSION FROM LANDFILL FOR

03:06:57.773 --> 03:07:00.042
ORGANIC WASTE AND THE PURPOSE TO

03:07:00.108 --> 03:07:03.078
AVOID METHANE. THAT ANY OF THESE

03:07:03.145 --> 03:07:06.715
MATERIALS THAT ARE. FOSS FUEL

03:07:06.782 --> 03:07:08.684
BASED. BREAKING DOWN IN THE LAND

03:07:08.750 --> 03:07:10.786
PRETTY- NOTHING THEY ARE THE

03:07:10.852 --> 03:07:12.988
SAME AS IF WE PUT FOOD WASTE

03:07:13.055 --> 03:07:14.289
THEY MIGHT TAKE LONGER TO BREAK

03:07:14.356 --> 03:07:16.391
DOWN BUT THEY'RE THE SAME AS IF

03:07:16.458 --> 03:07:18.160
WE PUT PAPER FOOD WASTE OR THOSE

03:07:18.226 --> 03:07:20.662
OTHER ORGANICS IN A LANDFILL SO

03:07:20.729 --> 03:07:22.798
THERE'S YOU KNOW MULTIPLE.

03:07:22.864 --> 03:07:24.933
FORTUNATELY NEGATIVE DIMENSIONS

03:07:25.000 --> 03:07:26.768
TO THE FACT THAT I LOVE CLOTHES

03:07:26.835 --> 03:07:28.770
ANYWAY- THERE ARE MULTIPLE

03:07:28.837 --> 03:07:33.976
OFFICE STAND. THERE AND- YEAH SO

03:07:34.042 --> 03:07:36.745
I THINK THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT

03:07:36.812 --> 03:07:38.313
BUT I ALSO THINK WE MIGHT HAVE

03:07:38.380 --> 03:07:40.148
TO OVER TIME THINK ABOUT HOW TO

03:07:40.215 --> 03:07:41.883
EVEN PREVENT THIS FROM GETTING

03:07:41.950 --> 03:07:45.587
INTO LANDFILLS SO- ANYWAY I

03:07:45.654 --> 03:07:48.857
REALLY APPRECIATE THE BILL. BY

03:07:48.924 --> 03:07:50.158
TO BE A CO AUTHOR NORMAN THE

03:07:50.225 --> 03:07:52.561
BILL. Q. SENATE- I JUST HAVE A

03:07:52.628 --> 03:07:54.630
QUESTION FOR THE WITNESSES IF I

03:07:58.767 --> 03:07:59.901
AMENDS REPORTED I THINK IT'S A

03:07:59.968 --> 03:08:03.338
REALLY GOOD IDEA I WANT. THE IT

03:08:03.405 --> 03:08:06.274
MAY. BUT CAUGHT MUST HIS CAUGHT

03:08:06.341 --> 03:08:08.110
MOMENT KNOW THERE'S LOT OF-

03:08:08.176 --> 03:08:10.646
WILHELM SYNTHETIC IN OUR CLOTHES

03:08:10.712 --> 03:08:12.547
BUT IT CAN IT CAN NOT BE

03:08:12.614 --> 03:08:14.816
REPURPOSE LIKE WE DO- PAPER WE

03:08:14.883 --> 03:08:16.318
CAN TAKE PAPER WE CAN RECYCLE

03:08:16.385 --> 03:08:17.185
AND WE COULD PUT RIGHT BACK IN

03:08:17.252 --> 03:08:19.721
THE PAPER AGAIN IS THERE IS

03:08:19.788 --> 03:08:20.355
THERE ANY- TECHNOLOGY THAT'S

03:08:20.422 --> 03:08:23.725

HAVE ANY MECHANICAL RECYCLERS IN

03:08:30.032 --> 03:08:31.700
STATE HOPEFULLY A FUTURE BILL

03:08:31.767 --> 03:08:33.435
COULD INCENTIVIZE THAT BUT- A

03:08:33.502 --> 03:08:35.604
LOT OF THE MOST MECHANICAL WRIST

03:08:35.671 --> 03:08:36.271
LIKE. FOR COTTON ANOTHER NATURAL

03:08:36.338 --> 03:08:37.372
FIBERS ARE. EAST COAST MEXICO

SPAIN INDIA. YEAH THAT THAT

03:08:39.808 --> 03:08:42.811
TECHNOLOGY EXISTS. AND GREAT

03:08:42.878 --> 03:08:45.013
OPPORTUNITY TO KEEP THESE.

03:08:45.080 --> 03:08:47.683
FIBERS IN USE WITHOUT USING TOO

03:08:47.749 --> 03:08:49.685
MUCH ENERGY INTO MUCH WATER TO.

RECYCLING PROVIDES BASICALLY

03:08:55.057 --> 03:08:56.992
SHREDDING AND RE TWISTING THE

03:08:57.059 --> 03:08:59.261
FIBERS INTO YARN. WELL IN

03:08:59.327 --> 03:09:01.763

SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND I'M

03:09:03.665 --> 03:09:04.900
ASSUMING THAT WHEN WE'RE USING

03:09:04.966 --> 03:09:07.602
THE TERM RECYCLE IN THIS CASE.

03:09:07.669 --> 03:09:09.204
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT CREATING A

03:09:09.271 --> 03:09:11.073
COLLECTION SYSTEM BUT THAT IT

03:09:11.139 --> 03:09:13.141
PROBABLY AND I HOPE THIS IS TRUE

03:09:13.208 --> 03:09:15.377
INCLUDES POTENTIALLY REDUCE

03:09:15.444 --> 03:09:16.678
BECAUSE IF YOU TAKE LIKE

GOODWILL AND MAYBE THEY USE

03:09:38.233 --> 03:09:40.402
MAYBE THEY CAPTURE LIKE 30% OF

03:09:40.469 --> 03:09:42.003

03:37:40.847 --> 03:37:43.216
AS I SAID BEFORE IT'S NOT JUST A

03:37:43.283 --> 03:37:44.418
CENTRAL VALLEY ISSUE IT'S NOT

REPORT TELLS US THAT WATER.

03:37:49.356 --> 03:37:50.924
SCARCITY NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT

03:37:50.991 --> 03:37:52.959
REALLY IN IT AND A NEXUS WITH

03:37:53.026 --> 03:37:55.162
FRAMEWORK WITH FOOD HEALTH

EXPERIENCE WATER PROBLEMS WERE

03:38:10.477 --> 03:38:11.511
JUST POOR WATER QUALITY OR

03:38:11.578 --> 03:38:13.213
FLOODS THAT WILL RISK

03:38:13.280 --> 03:38:14.981
INSTABILITY AND STATE FAILURE

03:38:15.048 --> 03:38:15.982
INCREASED REGIONAL TENSIONS. AND

03:38:16.049 --> 03:38:17.017
DISTRACT THEM FROM WORKING WITH

GROUNDWATER SUPPLIES IN SOME.

03:38:26.092 --> 03:38:27.794
AREAS GOING TO POUR WATER

03:38:27.861 --> 03:38:30.430
MANAGEMENT WILL POSE A RISK TO

03:38:30.497 --> 03:38:31.198
BOTH NATIONAL GLOBAL FOOD

03:38:31.264 --> 03:38:32.165
MARKETS. THAT WATER ENSURE

03:38:32.232 --> 03:38:34.167
BASINS WILL INCREASINGLY BE USED

03:38:34.234 --> 03:38:36.369
AS LEVERAGE AND THE USE OF WATER

03:38:36.436 --> 03:38:38.305
AS A WEAPON OR TWO FOR THE

03:38:38.371 --> 03:38:40.273
TERRORIST. UP PROJECT OBJECTIVES

03:38:40.340 --> 03:38:42.075
WILL ALSO BECOME MORE LIKELY.

03:38:42.142 --> 03:38:43.109
I'VE BEEN WORKING TO FIND YOU

03:38:43.176 --> 03:38:44.044
STRATEGIES AND WAYS TO

COLLABORATE TO HELP ADDRESS THE

03:38:45.979 --> 03:38:47.481
DROUGHT WE ARE FACING A PROTECT

03:38:47.547 --> 03:38:49.549
US FROM WATER AND FOOD SCARCITY.

03:38:49.616 --> 03:38:51.251
NOW AND INTO THE FUTURE. AND I

EIGHT I. LAST YEAR THE SENATE

03:38:55.522 --> 03:38:57.390
MADE- AND PUSH NAVIGATOR FOR

03:38:57.457 --> 03:38:58.625
UNPRECEDENTED INVESTMENTS IN OUR

03:38:58.692 --> 03:38:59.860
WATER INFRASTRUCTURE AND

03:38:59.926 --> 03:39:01.261
CONSTRUCTION HAS ALREADY BEGUN

03:39:01.328 --> 03:39:02.529
TO RIP TO REPAIR THE STATE'S

03:39:02.596 --> 03:39:04.664
WATER CONVEYANCE SYSTEMS THIS IS

03:39:04.731 --> 03:39:06.833
THE BEST INVESTMENT WE CAN MAKE

03:39:06.900 --> 03:39:07.968
TO CONSERVE THE LIMITED WATER

03:39:08.034 --> 03:39:09.503
SUPPLY THAT WE HAVE BEEN

03:39:09.569 --> 03:39:11.104
DELIVERED TO COMMUNITIES ACROSS

03:39:11.171 --> 03:39:12.239
THE STATE. BUDGET THE CENTRAL

03:39:12.305 --> 03:39:13.340
VALLEY. BUT MORE FUNDING IS

03:39:13.406 --> 03:39:15.175
STILL NEEDED FOR REPAIRS BUT

03:39:15.242 --> 03:39:16.810
UNTIL FULL REPAIRS ARE MADE WE

03:39:16.877 --> 03:39:18.178
WILL CONTINUE LOSE WEIGHT TOO

03:39:18.245 --> 03:39:19.279
MUCH PRECIOUS WATER AS IT

03:39:19.346 --> 03:39:20.380
TRAVELS THROUGH THE CENTRAL

03:39:20.447 --> 03:39:21.715
VALLEY. AND TO SOUTHERN

03:39:21.781 --> 03:39:24.851
CALIFORNIA- IT'S WATER THAT WE

03:39:24.918 --> 03:39:27.020
CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE IN IN THIS

03:39:27.087 --> 03:39:29.823
CLIMATE. AND JUST LAST YEAR

03:39:29.890 --> 03:39:31.424
THERE WERE MANY TOWNS ACROSS MY

03:39:31.491 --> 03:39:34.528
SENATE DISTRICT. THAT OTHER

03:39:34.594 --> 03:39:37.230
WELLS RAN DRY AND AS I MENTIONED

03:39:37.297 --> 03:39:38.398
EARLIER WE KNOW THE SIX MILLION

03:39:38.465 --> 03:39:40.634
PEOPLE FROM PARTS OF LOS ANGELES

03:39:40.700 --> 03:39:41.868

THE- ON THE STATE WATER PROJECT

03:39:46.573 --> 03:39:49.142
COULD EXPERIENCE THE SAME. SO

03:39:49.209 --> 03:39:50.110
THE IMPACT THE POOR WATER

03:39:50.176 --> 03:39:51.645

THE TRANSPARENCY THE

03:39:59.953 --> 03:40:02.355
THOUGHTFULNESS AND EFFICIENCY OF

03:40:02.422 --> 03:40:03.490
HOW DECISIONS FOR UNDERWATER

03:40:03.557 --> 03:40:05.458
MEAT. TODAY THERE ARE TOO MANY

03:40:05.525 --> 03:40:06.593
GOVERNMENT ENTITIES AT EACH DEAL

03:40:06.660 --> 03:40:07.994
WITH A PIECE OF WATER MANAGEMENT

03:40:08.061 --> 03:40:09.829
WITH SIMILAR BUT SOMETIMES

03:40:09.896 --> 03:40:11.598
CONFLICTING GOALS. AND THOSE

03:40:11.665 --> 03:40:13.033
MOST IMPACTED BY THE DECISIONS

03:40:13.099 --> 03:40:14.601
THEY MAKE BOTH MOBILE OFTEN LOW

03:40:14.668 --> 03:40:16.503
INCOME AND OR AND RURAL

03:40:16.570 --> 03:40:18.505
COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS AG. ARE

03:40:18.572 --> 03:40:20.040
TOO OFTEN NOT PART OF THE

03:40:20.106 --> 03:40:21.675
DECISION MAKING PROCESS THE LAWS

03:40:21.741 --> 03:40:23.109
OF THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS

03:40:23.176 --> 03:40:26.713

LIVE IN TODAY. WE INTRODUCED

03:40:29.349 --> 03:40:31.051
SENATE BILL TWELVE NINETEEN ALSO

PROTECTED FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS

03:40:39.826 --> 03:40:44.064
ABUSE. MODERNIZING IN TWENTY

03:40:44.130 --> 03:40:45.131
TWENTY TWO MEANS INCREASING

03:40:45.198 --> 03:40:46.466
TRANSPARENCY. MODERNIZING MEANS

03:40:46.533 --> 03:40:48.468
THAT WE HAVE BETTER CONTROL OF

03:40:48.535 --> 03:40:50.804
WATER FEET INCREASES. SOME OF

03:40:50.870 --> 03:40:52.238
THOSE FEE INCREASES BEING FELT

03:40:52.305 --> 03:40:54.040
ACROSS EVERY PART OF CALIFORNIA

03:40:54.107 --> 03:40:56.376
WILL CONTINUE TO RISE MORE THAN

03:40:56.443 --> 03:40:58.612
LIKELY. MODERNIZE IT ALSO MEANS

03:40:58.678 --> 03:41:00.080
THAT WE DO BETTER PROVIDING

DESPERATELY NEED. MODERNIZING

03:41:07.587 --> 03:41:10.490
MEANS WE HAVE A CYBER SECURITY

03:41:10.557 --> 03:41:11.758
ACROSS OUR WATER SYSTEM AND

03:41:11.825 --> 03:41:14.461
ACKNOWLEDGES THE NEW ERA OF

CYBER WARFARE WE ARE IN TODAY.

03:41:16.796 --> 03:41:18.465
AND HOW IT COULD BE USED AGAINST

03:41:18.531 --> 03:41:19.833
US COLLEAGUES FOR WATER

03:41:19.899 --> 03:41:21.568
MANAGEMENT MAKES US ALL

03:41:21.635 --> 03:41:23.436
VULNERABLE AND REALLY I THINK IN

WILL IMPROVE OUR WATER

03:41:31.044 --> 03:41:32.312
MANAGEMENT BY CREATING A

03:41:32.379 --> 03:41:33.380
COMMITTEE THAT WILL PROVIDE

WATER MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK. A

03:41:36.683 --> 03:41:38.218
MODERN SYSTEM THAT WILL HELP US

THINK WHAT'S REALLY REALLY

03:42:02.242 --> 03:42:04.010
IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS BILL IS A

03:42:04.077 --> 03:42:04.878
COUPLE THINGS I WANT TO

03:42:04.944 --> 03:42:07.147
EMPHASIZE. THAT THE BOTTOM OF

03:42:07.213 --> 03:42:09.883
THE- PAGE THREE OF THE ANALYSIS.

03:42:09.949 --> 03:42:13.486
IS WHAT LOOKS LIKE JUST ANOTHER

03:42:13.553 --> 03:42:14.454
ENUMERATED. BULLET POINT IF YOU

03:42:14.521 --> 03:42:16.656
WILL. ABOUT VARIOUS FINDINGS

03:42:16.723 --> 03:42:19.192

PROCESS THAT'S CALLED OUT IN THE

03:42:20.493 --> 03:42:23.563
BILL- BUT- THAT STATEMENT IS

03:42:23.630 --> 03:42:24.431
REALLY ALMOST MORE OF A

03:42:24.497 --> 03:42:26.499
CONCLUSION. TO ENSURE THAT THE

03:42:26.566 --> 03:42:28.401
STATE HAS A MODERN TWENTY FIRST

03:42:28.468 --> 03:42:29.402
CENTURY SAID WATER WAS

03:42:29.469 --> 03:42:31.171
REGULATIONS. AND STATE LOCAL

03:42:31.237 --> 03:42:33.139
WATER AGENCIES. IT'S IMPORTANT

03:42:33.206 --> 03:42:34.874
THAT THE STATE TAKE A TOP TO

03:42:34.941 --> 03:42:36.643
BOTTOM REVIEW OF HOW WATER

03:42:36.710 --> 03:42:38.278
RESOURCES IN THE STATE ARE

03:42:38.344 --> 03:42:40.013
MANAGED IN I'D IN IDENTIFY

03:42:40.080 --> 03:42:42.782
NECESSARY REFORMS. THAT'S

03:42:42.849 --> 03:42:44.217
NECESSARY REFORMS FOR A WATER

03:42:44.284 --> 03:42:45.919
SYSTEM THAT NEEDS TO SERVE.

03:42:45.985 --> 03:42:48.588
EVERYBODY EVERY STAKEHOLDER- IN

03:42:48.655 --> 03:42:50.156
EVERY ISSUE OUT THERE IS THAT

03:42:50.223 --> 03:42:52.959
THE BISHOPS. IN A COMPREHENSIVE

03:42:53.026 --> 03:42:55.829
YES BUT TO DO THAT- THE BILL

03:42:55.895 --> 03:42:58.164
CALLS FOR A MAIN COMMITTEE-

03:42:58.231 --> 03:43:00.867
WHICH WOULD BE SET UP. IT IT THE

03:43:00.934 --> 03:43:03.837
SET UP ITSELF WOULD BE IN A VERY

03:43:03.903 --> 03:43:07.807

FORWARD AT LEAST IN THE

03:43:39.272 --> 03:43:44.344
ANALYSIS- THAT- THAT SOMEHOW

03:43:44.410 --> 03:43:46.780
THIS KIND OF WORK COULD BE DONE.

03:43:46.846 --> 03:43:49.983
IMPLIED NOT AT TAXPAYER EXPENSE

03:43:50.049 --> 03:43:51.151

HAVE A MODERNIZED WATER SYSTEM

03:44:08.535 --> 03:44:10.904
WOULD WANT MODERNIZE WAY TO LOOK

03:44:10.970 --> 03:44:12.272
AT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE WATER

03:44:12.338 --> 03:44:14.340
SYSTEM AT ANY MOMENT NOTHING

03:44:14.407 --> 03:44:16.242
EVEN EQUIPMENT THE ICE SO THAT

03:44:16.309 --> 03:44:18.044
WOULD APPLY TO WATER RIGHT NOW.

03:44:18.111 --> 03:44:20.780
WE NEED IT IT OF COURSE S. B.

03:44:20.847 --> 03:44:23.316
THE PROCESS OR ANALYSIS TO BE

PAID FOR TAXPAYERS EXPENSE-

03:44:25.552 --> 03:44:29.022
TRANSPARENCY IS NOT ONLY NOT A

03:44:29.088 --> 03:44:32.458

03:51:30.343 --> 03:51:32.245
IS NECESSARILY. GONNA BE

03:51:32.311 --> 03:51:34.747
ANTITHETICAL TO OUR

OF THE GOALS OF THE ENVIRONMENT

03:51:45.057 --> 03:51:45.591
COMMITTEE MET THROUGH A BILL.

CALIFORNIA. PERSONALLY I THINK

03:52:13.119 --> 03:52:14.020
WE SHOULD ALWAYS MAKE SURE THE

03:52:14.086 --> 03:52:16.155

03:52:19.692 --> 03:52:21.727
FANTASTIC APPROACH- WE ARE

03:52:21.794 --> 03:52:22.261
CONCERNED ABOUT JUST THE

03:52:22.328 --> 03:52:23.929
APPROACH BEING IN THIS MODEL I

03:52:23.996 --> 03:52:25.031
THINK IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO

03:52:25.097 --> 03:52:27.933
WHO WHO IS WHO IS DEFINING WHAT.

03:52:28.000 --> 03:52:29.335
IT MEANS MODERNIZE MEANS AND- WE

03:52:29.402 --> 03:52:31.671
ARE WE'RE JUST CONCERNED ABOUT-

03:52:31.737 --> 03:52:33.205
MAKING SURE THAT THE GOALS AT

03:52:33.272 --> 03:52:34.440
THE OUTSET OF THIS COMMITTEE ARE

03:52:34.507 --> 03:52:36.008
REALLY ARE THEY GONNA BE FOCUSED

03:52:36.075 --> 03:52:37.743
WITH MAKING SURE THAT THOSE

03:52:37.810 --> 03:52:38.411
ENVIRONMENTAL THIS ENVIRONMENTAL

03:52:38.477 --> 03:52:39.779
JUSTICE BENEFITS OR MATT. IS

03:52:39.845 --> 03:52:41.881
THERE GOING TO BE A PUSH TOWARDS

03:52:41.947 --> 03:52:43.783
TOWARDS OTHER THINGS THAT MAYBE

03:52:43.849 --> 03:52:45.151
THE COMMUNITY IS CONCERNED ABOUT

03:52:45.217 --> 03:52:47.186
AND I JUST- SEEING WHERE THE

03:52:47.253 --> 03:52:49.088
BILL ORIGINATED BECAUSE CONCERT

03:52:49.155 --> 03:52:51.957
WITH US SO WE ARE AND HOW HOW IT

03:52:52.024 --> 03:52:53.826
ORIGINALLY LOOKED AT W.

03:52:53.893 --> 03:52:56.028
APPRECIATE AND SO NATURI AND

03:52:56.095 --> 03:53:00.266
WATER- WE RECOGNIZE THAT. THAT

03:53:00.333 --> 03:53:02.168
THE- LEVEL OF CONCERN ABOUT HOW

03:53:02.234 --> 03:53:04.136
THE PORT ITSELF IS REGULATING-

03:53:04.203 --> 03:53:05.371
WHERE IS FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IT

03:53:05.438 --> 03:53:06.939
HAS BEEN HELPFUL IN IN

03:53:07.006 --> 03:53:07.940
ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF THE

03:53:08.007 --> 03:53:09.642
COMMUNITIES AND- YOU KNOW THAT'S

03:53:09.709 --> 03:53:11.077
WHY WE WORK TO PUT THE SECOND

03:53:11.143 --> 03:53:12.244
PART BILL. THANK REPORTABLE

03:53:12.311 --> 03:53:14.380
DRINKING WATER FUND THERE- SO WE

03:53:14.447 --> 03:53:16.415
ARE CONCERNED THAT THE BOARD IS

03:53:16.482 --> 03:53:18.217
PRESERVED AND WE GOT THAT.

03:53:18.284 --> 03:53:19.185
ORIGINAL PROPOSALS. OFF THE

03:53:19.251 --> 03:53:22.121
TABLE. YEAH YEAH BUT FOR MY FROM

03:53:22.188 --> 03:53:23.456
OUR PERSPECTIVE WE ARE CONCERNED

03:53:23.522 --> 03:53:24.924
ABOUT SETTING UP A PROCESS THAT

03:53:24.990 --> 03:53:27.193
THAT THAT IS THAT IS THE- WHEN

03:53:27.259 --> 03:53:28.728
WE TALK ABOUT WHAT MODERNIZATION

03:53:28.794 --> 03:53:30.563
MEANS. THAT THAT COMES FROM OF

03:53:30.629 --> 03:53:32.698
FROM THAT PLACE THAT THIS COMES

03:53:32.765 --> 03:53:34.467
WROTE FROM WHAT NEEDS TO BE

03:53:34.533 --> 03:53:35.067
MODERNISED GETTING RID OF THE

03:53:35.134 --> 03:53:37.269
WORD OKAY WILL MAYBE WE'RE NOT

03:53:37.336 --> 03:53:38.471
GETTING RID OF THE BOARD

03:53:38.537 --> 03:53:39.305
ANYMORE. BUT IT'S STILL COMING

03:53:39.372 --> 03:53:40.973
FROM THE SIDE OF THINGS THAT THE

03:53:41.040 --> 03:53:43.075
BOARD HAS BEEN AN IMPEDIMENT.

03:53:43.142 --> 03:53:44.143
THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM AND HOW

03:53:44.210 --> 03:53:46.078
THE HOW THE STATE'S GOING AND

03:53:46.145 --> 03:53:48.447
THAT WE NEED TO JUST MOVE

03:53:48.514 --> 03:53:49.115
EVERYTHING TO A DIFFERENT AGENCY

03:53:49.181 --> 03:53:50.383
OR OR TEAR DOWN WHAT'S ALREADY

03:53:50.449 --> 03:53:53.185
THERE- AND SO WE JUST HAVE

03:53:53.252 --> 03:53:54.820
CONCERNS WITH THE PROCESS AS

03:53:54.887 --> 03:53:56.122
WRITTEN. OUT I'M THAT IT'S

03:53:56.188 --> 03:53:57.056
WHETHER OR NOT IT'S SOMETHING

03:53:57.123 --> 03:53:59.125
THAT. IS GOING TO BE DESIGNED IN

03:53:59.191 --> 03:54:00.926
A WAY TOWARDS. THAT WHAT'S FROM

03:54:00.993 --> 03:54:01.527
GETTING TOWARDS ENVIRONMENTAL

THOSE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

03:54:02.928 --> 03:54:04.730
AIMS- AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS

03:54:04.797 --> 03:54:08.634
THAT WE CAN TRUST WHEREAS- AND-

03:54:08.701 --> 03:54:10.102
WHAT WE DON'T WANT IS IF THAT'S

03:54:10.169 --> 03:54:11.971
NOT THE CASE. THAN IS THAT GOING

03:54:12.037 --> 03:54:13.105

GUESS I MEAN THIS IS THIS IS NOT

03:54:20.780 --> 03:54:21.747
LIKE THE STATUS QUO IS GREAT

03:54:21.814 --> 03:54:22.948
EITHER- AND SHE'S ASKING. WITH

03:54:23.015 --> 03:54:24.884
THE OTHERS ARE ASKING FOR IT FOR

03:54:24.950 --> 03:54:26.752
A REAL LOOK I MEAN USING THE

03:54:26.819 --> 03:54:28.554
ANSWERED IT FOR US TO JUST SIT

03:54:28.621 --> 03:54:29.989
DOWN AND TRY TO. WORK ON THE

03:54:30.055 --> 03:54:32.291
LANGUAGE. I MEAN IT WILL LET LET

03:54:32.358 --> 03:54:33.025
LET ME THIRTY YOU- SENATOR IT

03:54:33.092 --> 03:54:35.461
WHAT. IT OBVIOUSLY I THINK YOUR

03:54:35.528 --> 03:54:36.996
ORIGINAL PROPOSAL REALLY TOOK A

03:54:37.062 --> 03:54:39.031
LOT OF PEOPLE BACK I MEAN IT WAS

03:54:39.098 --> 03:54:40.599
OF. A SERIOUS BACKLASH AMONG

03:54:40.666 --> 03:54:41.233
YOUR COLLEAGUES. ABOUT THE IDEA

03:54:41.300 --> 03:54:43.202
JUST TO SPENDING THE WATER

03:54:43.269 --> 03:54:44.103
BOARD- I THOUGHT YOU KNOW COURSE

03:54:44.170 --> 03:54:47.273
NOW THIS IS A TOTALLY.

03:54:47.339 --> 03:54:49.475
DRAMATICALLY CHANGE BILL. YOU

03:54:49.542 --> 03:54:51.343
HAVE A HEARING. I SHARE THE

03:54:51.410 --> 03:54:53.212
CONCERNS OF KYLE'S ARTICULATED-

03:54:53.279 --> 03:54:54.947
I KNOW IF I WERE TO VOTE FOR

03:54:55.014 --> 03:54:56.182
THIS TODAY WOULD BE DONE WITH

03:54:56.248 --> 03:54:57.750
THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT.

03:54:57.817 --> 03:54:59.018
THOSE SOME OF THOSE KEY CONCERNS

03:54:59.084 --> 03:55:00.586
ARE GOING TO BE AN IMPORTANT

03:55:00.653 --> 03:55:02.054
PART OF THE ANALYSIS THAT'S-

03:55:02.121 --> 03:55:03.589
BEING. HI THAT'S BEING BROUGHT

03:55:03.656 --> 03:55:05.558
TO BEAR THROUGH THIS PROCESS BUT

03:55:05.624 --> 03:55:07.092
WHAT WHAT WHAT'S YOUR INTENT.

03:55:07.159 --> 03:55:09.061
WITH THIS BILL AS IT STANDS NOW

03:55:09.128 --> 03:55:11.831
LOOK I UNDERSTAND IT. FOR THE

03:55:11.897 --> 03:55:13.699
CONTROL. THE OPPOSITION IS

03:55:13.766 --> 03:55:15.701
COMING FROM RIGHT THAT WE

03:55:15.768 --> 03:55:17.570
ORIGINALLY WITH THIS BILL WE HAD

03:55:17.636 --> 03:55:20.272
TO. INCLUDE LANGUAGE TO GET RID

03:55:20.339 --> 03:55:21.841
OF THE WATER BOARD LOOK THE REAL

03:55:21.907 --> 03:55:23.909
LET'S BE REAL THE WATER BOARD

03:55:23.976 --> 03:55:25.945
IT'S- IT'S NOT THE MEMBERS IT'S

03:55:26.011 --> 03:55:28.247
JUST IT'S THE SYSTEM. RIGHT THAT

03:55:28.314 --> 03:55:29.715
IS JUST NOT WORKING AND THAT'S

03:55:29.782 --> 03:55:31.984
WHY IT NEEDS TO BE REVAMPED. AND

03:55:32.051 --> 03:55:34.920
IT'S HONESTLY A LITTLE. IT'S

03:55:34.987 --> 03:55:37.389
VERY DISAPPOINTING THAT- THE%

03:55:37.456 --> 03:55:39.592
OPPOSITION I MEAN THERE'S- THIS

03:55:39.658 --> 03:55:42.228
IS A BILL THAT- WE MADE

03:55:42.294 --> 03:55:44.430
AMENDMENTS TO MAKE IT WORK SO IT

03:55:44.497 --> 03:55:46.165
LOOKS AT THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE

03:55:46.232 --> 03:55:47.600
RIGHT. WE TOOK A WHOLE APPROACH

03:55:47.666 --> 03:55:50.769
VERSUS JUST. FOCUSED ON ON ON

03:55:50.836 --> 03:55:53.572
THE WATER FORGE PEACE OR HAVING

03:55:53.639 --> 03:55:55.107
TO PUT IT AS WELL I THINK THIS

03:55:55.174 --> 03:55:57.710
IS MORE OF A PERSONAL OPPOSITION

03:55:57.776 --> 03:55:59.078
TO THIS BILL RIGHT THAN ANYTHING

03:55:59.144 --> 03:56:00.246
ELSE WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE

03:56:00.312 --> 03:56:02.147
BECAUSE WE DO NEED REFORMS. NOW

03:56:02.214 --> 03:56:03.916
I DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER WHAT

03:56:03.983 --> 03:56:05.417
THE OUTCOMES OF WHAT THIS

03:56:05.484 --> 03:56:07.353
COMMITTEE WOULD WHAT YOU KNOW

03:56:07.419 --> 03:56:09.188
PUT PROPOSED AND PUT IN FRONT OF

03:56:09.255 --> 03:56:11.323
US THIS IS. THIS IS A GROUP OF

03:56:11.390 --> 03:56:12.525
PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN DOING THE

03:56:12.591 --> 03:56:14.727
WORK THAT ARE THE EXPERTS IN THE

03:56:14.793 --> 03:56:16.428
AREA THAT ARE THERE ARE COMING

03:56:16.495 --> 03:56:20.766
TOGETHER TO. PRESENT SOLUTIONS.

03:56:20.833 --> 03:56:25.337
TO LEGISLATORS AND SO- I DON'T

03:56:25.404 --> 03:56:27.306
HAVE ANY OUT I MEAN. PROBABLY IF

03:56:27.373 --> 03:56:29.174
APPOINTED. YET THERE ARE

03:56:29.241 --> 03:56:31.377
DIRECTLY SPEAKING I MEAN I THINK

03:56:31.443 --> 03:56:32.978
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT I WOULD

03:56:33.045 --> 03:56:34.780
HAVE SOME SORT OF INFLUENCE IN

03:56:34.847 --> 03:56:36.982
FRONT. AT YOU KNOW OVER WHAT THE

03:56:37.049 --> 03:56:38.984
WHAT THE OUTCOMES ARE FACTS. I

03:56:39.051 --> 03:56:41.053
MEAN THAT'S RIGHT IF LIKE-

03:56:41.120 --> 03:56:43.822
HEATER BUT I GET IT AND YOU CAN

03:56:43.889 --> 03:56:45.124
LOOK AT ANYTHING ELSE RIGHT AND

03:56:45.190 --> 03:56:46.892
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THEY WERE

03:56:46.959 --> 03:56:48.327
NERVOUS GIVEN THE ORIGINAL BILL

03:56:48.394 --> 03:56:49.895
BUT BUT THAT BUT THAT IT'S A NEW

03:56:49.962 --> 03:56:52.264
BILL RIGHT I MEAN WE'VE ALL BEEN

03:56:52.331 --> 03:56:53.465
THERE. I GET THAT THEY'RE

03:56:53.532 --> 03:56:54.333
NERVOUS BUT THE PROBLEM THE

03:56:54.400 --> 03:56:56.035
PROBLEMS ARE STILL THERE AND IT

03:56:56.101 --> 03:56:57.002
SURE DIDN'T TAKE IT PERSONAL

03:56:57.069 --> 03:56:58.270
RIGHT SURE YOU SHOULD BE WORKING

03:56:58.337 --> 03:56:59.838
TOGETHER TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE

03:56:59.905 --> 03:57:01.040
AND I'M SURE THAT. KYLE COULD

03:57:01.106 --> 03:57:03.008
AGREE TO SOME MODEL THAT GOT RID

03:57:03.075 --> 03:57:04.977
OF THE WATER BOARD IN RETURN FOR

03:57:05.044 --> 03:57:06.445
SOMETHING THAT HAD REALLY STRONG

03:57:06.512 --> 03:57:07.413
SAFEGUARDS THAT HE WOULD FEEL

03:57:07.479 --> 03:57:09.114
GOOD ABOUT I MEAN I'M SURE YOU

03:57:09.181 --> 03:57:10.416
DRAFT A OF AN ALTERNATIVE WATER

03:57:10.482 --> 03:57:12.585
BOARD PLAN THAT WOULD BE BAD.

03:57:12.651 --> 03:57:14.553
CURRENT THAT BEING YES SO. IN

03:57:14.620 --> 03:57:16.789
FACT THAT IS BECAUSE WHAT THE-

03:57:16.855 --> 03:57:18.691
WHAT. THE IN YEAH BUT IT MIGHT

03:57:18.757 --> 03:57:20.326
JUST IN A CONTINUE TODAY BE IT'S

03:57:20.392 --> 03:57:21.961
JUST BEEN VALIDATE WAS THAT THE

03:57:22.027 --> 03:57:23.596
ORIGINAL OPPOSITION LETTER PRIOR

03:57:23.662 --> 03:57:25.264
TO THE FIRST COMMITTEE HEARING

03:57:25.331 --> 03:57:27.366
SAID THE SOLUTION IS GONNA BE

03:57:27.433 --> 03:57:29.201
OUT. IN MUCH OF THE REST OF

03:57:29.268 --> 03:57:31.070
BILLS FINE ESSENTIALLY IN

03:57:31.136 --> 03:57:33.172
PARAPHRASING AND THIS IS THERE

03:57:33.238 --> 03:57:35.341
NEEDS TO BE A TOP TO BOTTOM

03:57:35.407 --> 03:57:37.710
REVIEW ALL RIGHT THEN WHAT I SO

03:57:37.776 --> 03:57:39.712
THAT'S ALL TO YOUR POINT. THAT

03:57:39.778 --> 03:57:41.280
WAS. FOR THOSE THOSE AMENDMENTS

03:57:41.347 --> 03:57:43.582
IN IN BEYOND WERE- WORK WERE

03:57:43.649 --> 03:57:46.051
ACCEPTED. THEY WERE HERE TODAY

03:57:46.118 --> 03:57:47.386
WITH THIS DRAMATICALLY REVAMPED

03:57:47.453 --> 03:57:49.355
BILL THREE DISSOLUTION IN IT.

03:57:49.421 --> 03:57:51.223
BUT WHAT WAS. SAID JUST A MINUTE

03:57:51.290 --> 03:57:52.925
AGO IT'S NOT A PARAPHRASE

03:57:52.992 --> 03:57:54.593
SOMEONE TRY TO QUIT EXACTLY IS

03:57:54.660 --> 03:57:56.295
OUR CONCERN IS WHERE THE BILL.

03:57:56.362 --> 03:57:58.831
CAME FROM. WHICH IS PERSONAL. I

03:57:58.897 --> 03:58:00.633
TAKE THAT PERSONALLY AS SOMEBODY

03:58:00.699 --> 03:58:02.301
WHO SPENT TWENTY YEARS PRESIDING

03:58:02.368 --> 03:58:04.003
OVER THE BAY ESTUARY PROJECT AS

03:58:04.069 --> 03:58:05.571
AN ELECTED OFFICIAL. THEY WERE

03:58:05.638 --> 03:58:07.106
RECEIVING A COMPLAINT FROM THE

03:58:07.172 --> 03:58:08.741
UPPER MIDDLE COMMUNITY JOINING

03:58:08.807 --> 03:58:11.076
UP WITH SOMEBODY. THE CERTAINLY

03:58:11.143 --> 03:58:13.178
REPRESENTS A DISTRICT WITH A LOT

03:58:13.245 --> 03:58:14.313
OF THAT CULTURAL INTEREST COMING

03:58:14.380 --> 03:58:16.181
FOR TOGETHER SAYING THERE NEEDS

03:58:16.248 --> 03:58:18.450
TO BE A TRUMP ON REVIEW.

03:58:18.517 --> 03:58:20.285
REGARDLESS IN ALLSTATE CORP

03:58:20.352 --> 03:58:22.688
FOLDERS IN THIS BILL HAVE BEEN-

03:58:22.755 --> 03:58:24.256
THIS BILL HAS BEEN OPENED UP

03:58:24.323 --> 03:58:25.791
WITH WHAT I CALL THE SECOND

03:58:25.858 --> 03:58:27.259
COMMITTEE STAKEHOLDER COMMITTEE.

03:58:27.326 --> 03:58:30.329
BUT TO INVITE STAKEHOLDERS TO BE

03:58:30.396 --> 03:58:31.597
PART OF THE PROCESS IN A VERY

03:58:31.664 --> 03:58:37.870
FAST WAY THOSE. TO WHERE IT CAME

03:58:37.936 --> 03:58:39.104
FROM. BURKE FROM A PERSONAL. AND

03:58:39.171 --> 03:58:40.939
WHAT IT SAID IN THE PAST. THAT'S

03:58:41.006 --> 03:58:42.374
NOT SURE OKAY I UNDERSTAND I

03:58:42.441 --> 03:58:44.176
UNDERSTAND BUT SURELY OR INTENT

03:58:44.243 --> 03:58:44.977
IS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS TO

03:58:45.044 --> 03:58:46.845
BE A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THIS

03:58:46.912 --> 03:58:47.913
ANALYSIS STORY THEY'RE NOT TO GO

ESSENTIALLY- ALL OF THOSE AREAS

03:59:30.889 --> 03:59:33.125

THE BILL CONTINUES TO BE VETTED.

03:59:35.427 --> 03:59:38.330
