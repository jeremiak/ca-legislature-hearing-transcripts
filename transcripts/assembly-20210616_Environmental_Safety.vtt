SERVICE STATION OWNER OPERATOR

00:52:21.471 --> 00:52:23.640
WHO DEALT WITH THE UNDERGROUND

STORAGE TANK LAWS- IN MY FAMILY

00:52:27.244 --> 00:52:29.746
CONTINUES TO THIS DAY-

00:52:29.813 --> 00:52:31.781
IRONICALLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT

00:52:31.848 --> 00:52:33.083
IT WAS MY FATHER'S LEGISLATION

00:52:33.149 --> 00:52:34.885
THAT CREATED THE REQUIREMENT

00:52:34.951 --> 00:52:37.087
THE FIRST PLACE SO. INTIMATELY

00:52:37.153 --> 00:52:39.322
AWARE OF THE ISSUES IN THE

00:52:39.389 --> 00:52:41.691
STEPS AND WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT

00:52:41.758 --> 00:52:42.759
OF FRUSTRATION OUT THERE IN

00:52:42.826 --> 00:52:44.594
TERMS OF WHAT HAPPENS WITH

00:52:44.661 --> 00:52:47.397
CLOSE SITES THAT OUR LEGACY

00:52:47.464 --> 00:52:47.998
SITES ON THE LIST AND WHETHER

00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:52.235
COMMITTEE THAT'LL BE THE ISSUE

00:52:52.302 --> 00:52:53.803
I THINK WHETHER OR NOT THOSE

00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:55.605
SHOULD AUTOMATICALLY TRIGGER

00:52:55.672 --> 00:52:57.741
SEEK WAY IRRESPECTIVE OF THE

00:52:57.807 --> 00:52:59.442
SCOPE OF THE PROJECT ITSELF

00:52:59.509 --> 00:53:03.313
THAT IS BEING PROPOSED. AND I'M

00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:04.648
HAPPY TO REPORT AS OF YESTERDAY

00:53:04.714 --> 00:53:07.751
PERFECT- IN PART DEALING WITH-

00:53:07.817 --> 00:53:09.886
THE ACTUAL PLAN DEPARTMENT IN

00:53:09.953 --> 00:53:13.456
MY HOME CITY SAN JOSE- WHERE

YOU KNOW CERTAINLY THE RUN

00:53:14.591 --> 00:53:17.294
ACROSS- THOUSANDS OF THESE

00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:20.263
CASES OVER TIME- THAT I THINK

00:53:20.330 --> 00:53:22.299
WE HAVE AN ELEGANT SOLUTION IN

00:53:22.365 --> 00:53:23.667
THE FORM OF AMENDMENTS THAT

00:53:23.733 --> 00:53:26.369
WILL- BASICALLY NOT SAY THE

00:53:26.436 --> 00:53:28.505
COMMONSENSE EXEMPTION IS IN

00:53:28.572 --> 00:53:30.640
PLAY BECAUSE THAT WOULD SAY

00:53:30.707 --> 00:53:32.275
THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF

00:53:32.342 --> 00:53:33.944
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ON THIS

00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:35.845
PROJECT GOING FORWARD EITHER

00:53:35.912 --> 00:53:37.914
EITHER FROM. A RESIDUAL FROM

00:53:37.981 --> 00:53:39.282
THE CLOSE SITE OR FROM THE

00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:41.685
SCOPE OF THE PROJECT ITSELF-

00:53:41.751 --> 00:53:42.719
THAT THIS IS NOT A FAIR

00:53:42.786 --> 00:53:43.954
STATEMENT THAT THERE'S NO

00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:45.455
POSSIBILITY OF ENVIRONMENTAL

00:53:45.522 --> 00:53:50.560
IMPACT. SHORT CUT TO SORT OF

00:53:50.627 --> 00:53:52.095
GET IT OFF THE LIST WHAT WE'D

00:53:52.162 --> 00:53:53.997
MUCH RATHER DO IS HAVE AN

00:53:54.064 --> 00:53:55.065
EXEMPTION THAT SAYS IF YOU'RE

00:53:55.131 --> 00:53:58.768
CLOSE SITE- THAT THAT NO LONGER

00:53:58.835 --> 00:54:00.136
WITH A NO FURTHER ACTION LETTER

00:54:00.203 --> 00:54:01.838
NO LONGER AUTOMATICALLY TRIGGER

00:54:01.905 --> 00:54:04.074
SEQUEL- AND THEN YOU'RE AND

00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:05.542
THEN YOUR PROJECT GOES THROUGH

00:54:05.609 --> 00:54:06.843
YOUR LOCAL PLANNING PROCESS

00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:08.311

LIKE THE I. R. IF IT'S BIG

00:54:11.615 --> 00:54:13.883
ENOUGH PROJECT- MAYBE IT HAS

00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:15.385
NOTHING BECAUSE IT'S A NEW ROOF

00:54:15.452 --> 00:54:17.854
ON THE BUILDING- BUT- BUT THAT

00:54:17.921 --> 00:54:20.390
IT WOULDN'T AUTOMATICALLY- FALL

00:54:20.457 --> 00:54:21.825
UNDER. YOU KNOW ANY OF THOSE

00:54:21.891 --> 00:54:23.026

UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON SB

01:05:08.504 --> 01:05:09.472
TWO TWO TWO WE AGREE WITH

SENATOR DODD THAT ANY WATER LOW

OF CALIFORNIA WE APPRECIATE THE

01:05:18.047 --> 01:05:19.849
MOMENTS THAT SENATOR DODD HAS

01:05:19.915 --> 01:05:21.751
MADE TO DATE. WE DO THINK THE

01:05:21.817 --> 01:05:23.753
BILL NEEDS MORE WORK OUR LETTER

01:05:23.819 --> 01:05:26.155
CAPTURES FIVE ISSUES AND ALL

01:05:26.222 --> 01:05:30.593
NOT TO OPPOSE THIS MORNING THAT

01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:31.227
ARE RELEVANT TO THIS COMMITTEE.

01:05:31.294 --> 01:05:33.629
THE FIRST IS- AS BACKGROUND THE

01:05:33.696 --> 01:05:35.398
BILL WOULD APPROPRIATELY HAVE

01:05:35.464 --> 01:05:36.599
THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY

01:05:36.666 --> 01:05:38.434
SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENT

01:05:38.501 --> 01:05:40.703
IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM. BUT THE

01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:43.005
PART OF THE BILL THAT ADDRESSES

01:05:43.072 --> 01:05:44.640
THE ADOPTION OF THE FUND

01:05:44.707 --> 01:05:46.342
EXPENDITURE PLAN FOR THE

01:05:46.409 --> 01:05:48.878
PROGRAM. PROPOSES TO HAVE BOTH

01:05:48.944 --> 01:05:50.479
THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY

01:05:50.546 --> 01:05:52.415
SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENT. IN

01:05:52.481 --> 01:05:54.750
THE STATE WATER BOARD APPROVES

01:05:54.817 --> 01:05:56.719
DEATH FUND EXPENDITURE PLANS.

01:05:56.786 --> 01:05:58.521
SO WE SUGGEST THAT THE

01:05:58.587 --> 01:06:00.589
DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE REQUIRED

01:06:00.656 --> 01:06:01.624
TO CONSULT WITH THE STATE WATER

01:06:01.691 --> 01:06:04.660
BOARD ON THE PLAN BUT THAT THE

01:06:04.727 --> 01:06:05.928
ADOPTION OF THE FUND

01:06:05.995 --> 01:06:07.530
EXPENDITURES PLANNED SHOULD BE

01:06:07.596 --> 01:06:09.365
THE RESPONSIBILITY. OF THE

01:06:09.432 --> 01:06:10.833
AGENCY THAT'S IN CHARGE OF THE

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:13.469
PROGRAM AND THAT'S THE

01:06:13.536 --> 01:06:15.404
DEPARTMENT- SO THAT WOULD BE A

01:06:15.471 --> 01:06:19.442
SIMPLE CHANGE IN SECTION ONE

01:06:19.508 --> 01:06:20.609
ONE SIX NINE THREE ONE POINT

01:06:20.676 --> 01:06:23.713
ONE SUBDIVISION A- THE SECOND

01:06:23.779 --> 01:06:28.551
ISSUE- RELATES TO A PROPOSAL IN

01:06:28.617 --> 01:06:29.318
THE BILL FOR A NEEDS

01:06:29.385 --> 01:06:31.587
ASSESSMENT. IN THE DEVELOPMENT

01:06:31.654 --> 01:06:34.957
BY THREE AGENCIES OF METRICS

01:06:35.024 --> 01:06:37.093
FOR THAT NEEDS ASSESSMENT- WE

01:06:37.159 --> 01:06:38.627
THINK THAT A GOOD LOW INCOME

01:06:38.694 --> 01:06:40.763
WATER RATE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM

01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:43.532
CAN BE VERY EFFICIENT STILL

01:06:43.599 --> 01:06:45.034
INSIDE INSTEAD OF SETTING UP A

01:06:45.101 --> 01:06:47.269
COMPLICATED NEEDS ASSESSMENT

01:06:47.336 --> 01:06:49.004
LIKE THERE YOU KNOW WE HAVE

01:06:49.071 --> 01:06:50.506
THAT FOR SB TWO HUNDRED THAT

01:06:50.573 --> 01:06:51.841
THAT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THAT

01:06:51.907 --> 01:06:52.641
PROGRAM WHICH IS VERY

01:06:52.708 --> 01:06:56.045
DIFFERENT. IN THIS CASE- THAT

01:06:56.112 --> 01:06:58.414
DEPARTMENT OR THE BILL CAN SET

01:06:58.481 --> 01:07:00.449
A FLAT RATE BENEFIT FOR LOW

01:07:00.516 --> 01:07:03.486
INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. AND WE'RE

01:07:03.552 --> 01:07:04.720
EXPECTING THAT THIS PROGRAM

01:07:04.787 --> 01:07:06.989
WOULD COME UP BENEFIT ABOUT A

01:07:07.056 --> 01:07:08.324
THIRD OF THE HOUSEHOLDS IN

01:07:08.391 --> 01:07:10.793
CALIFORNIA BETTER IN THAT'S HOW

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:13.229
MANY ARE LOW INCOME HELP. SO

01:07:13.295 --> 01:07:15.531
INSTEAD OF SPENDING. PROGRAM

01:07:15.598 --> 01:07:17.733
DOLLARS ON ADMINISTRATION AND

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:18.901
IMPLEMENTATION FOR NEEDS

01:07:18.968 --> 01:07:21.670
ASSESSMENT WE SUGGEST JUST YOU

01:07:21.737 --> 01:07:23.038
KNOW FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT FLAT

01:07:23.105 --> 01:07:25.408
RATE IS IN USE THE MONEY FOR

01:07:25.474 --> 01:07:27.543
THE BENEFT IN OTHER WORDS THE

01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:30.012
SUBSIDY. THAT WILL HELP THE LOW

01:07:30.079 --> 01:07:32.581
INCOME FAMILIES- BEFORE THEIR

01:07:32.648 --> 01:07:34.917
WATER BILL. SO WE IN YOU KNOW

01:07:34.984 --> 01:07:36.051
BOTTOM LINE IS WE THINK THERE

01:07:36.118 --> 01:07:38.220
CAN BE A GOOD PROGRAM HERE AND

01:07:38.287 --> 01:07:39.388
WE THINK IT SHOULD BE

01:07:39.455 --> 01:07:41.891
EFFICIENT. SO THAT- THAT CHANGE

01:07:41.957 --> 01:07:43.692
WOULD BE DELETING SUBDIVISIONS

01:07:43.759 --> 01:07:49.064
FEE OF PROPOSED SECTION. ONE

01:07:49.131 --> 01:07:49.999
ONE SIX NINE THREE ONE POINT

01:07:50.065 --> 01:07:51.133
ONE. SO THAT CONCLUDES MY

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:53.269
TESTIMONY AND WE APPRECIATE THE

01:07:53.335 --> 01:07:54.203

THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS

01:19:54.222 --> 01:19:55.657
IN THE EVAN FLOW SOMETIMES

01:19:55.724 --> 01:19:57.492

REALLY BEEN ABLE TO BE FACE TO

01:20:04.299 --> 01:20:04.799
FACE BECAUSE WE JUST OPENED

01:20:04.866 --> 01:20:07.202

THIS TODAY- BUT IT. BUT AS A

01:20:13.341 --> 01:20:14.743
FRIEND AND A COLLEAGUE WHO DOES

01:20:14.809 --> 01:20:16.711
CARE ABOUT THIS- WE HAVE TO GET

01:20:16.778 --> 01:20:19.114
THIS ONE RIGHT. UP TO MAKE SURE

01:20:19.181 --> 01:20:19.881
THAT THERE IS A SOLID FUNDING

01:20:19.948 --> 01:20:22.417
FORMULA. AND I DO BELIEVE THAT

01:20:22.484 --> 01:20:25.620
WITH THE MASSIVE BUDGET

01:20:25.687 --> 01:20:27.756
INCREASE THAT WE'VE SEEN- WHEN

01:20:27.822 --> 01:20:29.858
WE WERE EXPECTING A RECESSION

01:20:29.925 --> 01:20:34.262
TO SEE A- HUGE SURPLUS. WE

01:20:34.329 --> 01:20:35.297
WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THIS

01:20:35.363 --> 01:20:37.666
FUNDING SITUATION IS SET IN AN

01:20:37.732 --> 01:20:40.402
APPROPRIATE WAY. I LOOK FORWARD

01:20:40.468 --> 01:20:41.169
TO WORKING WITH YOU FURTHER ON

01:20:41.236 --> 01:20:44.506
THIS. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

01:20:44.573 --> 01:20:46.508
I'M LET ME JUST ADDRESS THE

01:20:46.575 --> 01:20:50.745
FUNDING ISSUE- UNDER PROP TWO

01:20:50.812 --> 01:20:52.547
EIGHTEEN AS THE SENATOR HAS

01:20:52.614 --> 01:20:57.719
SAID WE CAN'T HAVE- A- QUILLEN

01:20:57.786 --> 01:21:00.021
OF THE CARE PROGRAM THAT WE

01:21:00.088 --> 01:21:03.858
HAVE FOR UTILITIES FOR. BECAUSE

01:21:03.925 --> 01:21:05.694
UNDER PROP TWO EIGHTEEN

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:07.963
EVERYBODY PAYS THEIR OWN WAY

01:21:08.029 --> 01:21:08.697
THERE'S NO WAY TO SET UP

01:21:08.763 --> 01:21:11.099
PROGRAM THE OTHER QUESTION IS

01:21:11.166 --> 01:21:12.634
AND THIS IS WHAT ART WAS

01:21:12.701 --> 01:21:15.737
WORRIED ABOUT IS THAT WE COULD

01:21:15.804 --> 01:21:18.840
PRODUCE A TAX. I'M PUTTING IN

01:21:18.907 --> 01:21:21.409
THE BILL- THAT WE'RE NEVER

01:21:21.476 --> 01:21:24.779
GOING TO HAVE ANY KIND OF TAX-

01:21:24.846 --> 01:21:27.649
IS NOT FEASIBLE BECAUSE A PRE

01:21:27.716 --> 01:21:30.452
AT THE NEXT- LEGISLATURE COULD

01:21:30.518 --> 01:21:32.520
OVERRULE IT THIS IS A AN

01:21:32.587 --> 01:21:34.389
AMENDMENT THAT THEY'RE ASKING

01:21:34.456 --> 01:21:35.957
FOR WHICH SIMPLY. WOULD BE

01:21:36.024 --> 01:21:39.394
USELESS ARE THE NEXT LEGISLATOR

01:21:39.461 --> 01:21:44.266
LEGISLATION- DOES SIMPLY OVERLY

01:21:44.332 --> 01:21:47.202
SO- I DON'T SEE THAT HAPPENING

01:21:47.269 --> 01:21:48.503
THE OTHER THING IS TO GET ANY

01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:50.772
KIND OF TAX INCLUDING THE KIND

01:21:50.839 --> 01:21:52.641
OF TAX THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT-

01:21:52.707 --> 01:21:54.409
IT WOULD REQUIRE ANOTHER VOTE

01:21:54.476 --> 01:21:56.478
SO AGAIN THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE

01:21:56.544 --> 01:21:58.246
DEALING WITH TODAY AND I JUST

01:21:58.313 --> 01:22:00.115
WANT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR. THERE

01:22:00.181 --> 01:22:01.516
IS NO WAY TO DEAL WITH THAT

01:22:01.583 --> 01:22:04.019
FIRST OBJECTION. ALL RIGHT

01:22:04.085 --> 01:22:10.392
ANYONE ELSE. OKAY OF THE

01:22:10.458 --> 01:22:12.360
SENATOR PERHAPS IN YOUR CLOTHES

01:22:12.427 --> 01:22:15.697
YOU COULD TALK ABOUT. THE OTHER

01:22:15.764 --> 01:22:17.632
TWO AMENDMENTS ONE IS TO HAVE A

01:22:17.699 --> 01:22:24.105
SIMPLER- FUND A SIMPLER-

01:22:24.172 --> 01:22:26.341
DETERMINATION OF HOW THE

01:22:26.408 --> 01:22:30.378
FUNDING IS. SPENT AND THE OTHER

01:22:30.445 --> 01:22:34.582
IS- THAT THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN

01:22:34.649 --> 01:22:36.318
THE- CARE PROGRAM WHICH I DO

01:22:36.384 --> 01:22:41.089
NOT. WHAT ARE YOU ADDRESS THOSE

01:22:41.156 --> 01:22:41.690
TWO HOURS ARE SEVEN STRUCTURE

01:22:41.756 --> 01:22:44.559
SURE. SO YEAH THE FIRST ONE IS

01:22:44.626 --> 01:22:47.162
THE FIRST ONE OKAY IN THE

01:22:47.228 --> 01:22:49.331
SECOND ONE THAT THEY BRING UP.

01:22:49.397 --> 01:22:51.399
IS THAT THEY DON'T BELIEVE THAT

01:22:51.466 --> 01:22:56.271
CARE PROGRAM IS- PROPERLY SET

01:22:56.338 --> 01:23:08.283
UP. SO THAT THEY THINK THAT ARE

01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:09.718
ON CARE SHE BE ON THE IS A SAN

01:23:09.784 --> 01:23:10.885
WHAT THE SAYING WELL IF YOU'RE

01:23:10.952 --> 01:23:11.553

01:23:28.937 --> 01:23:30.138
SAME TIME I WANT TO FIND OUT

01:23:30.205 --> 01:23:32.340
WHAT THE COSTS ARE OF DOING IT

01:23:32.407 --> 01:23:34.175
THE WAY IT'S SET UP IN THE BILL

01:23:34.242 --> 01:23:35.777
BECAUSE WE MIGHT WANT TO CHANGE

01:23:35.844 --> 01:23:38.012

BE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO TAKE

CARE OF EVERYBODY AND SO-

01:23:56.765 --> 01:23:58.500
TAKING CARE OF NOBODY IS NOT AN

01:23:58.566 --> 01:24:00.568

01:36:16.403 --> 01:36:17.571
YOU CHAIR QUIRK IN MEMBERS

01:36:17.638 --> 01:36:19.773
CINDY TECH WITH AQUA AQUA DOES

01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:21.408
HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED

01:36:21.475 --> 01:36:24.445
POSITION ON AS BEFORE THREE WE

01:36:24.512 --> 01:36:25.412
REALLY APPRECIATE THE

01:36:25.479 --> 01:36:26.547
AMENDMENTS THAT SENATOR

01:36:26.614 --> 01:36:28.682
GONZALEZ HAS MADE TO DATE WE

01:36:28.749 --> 01:36:30.417
STILL HAVE TWO ISSUES WITH THE

01:36:30.484 --> 01:36:34.088
BILL. THE FIRST ISSUE IS THAT

01:36:34.155 --> 01:36:35.623
WERE OKAY WITH THE PROPOSED

01:36:35.689 --> 01:36:37.458
CONSOLIDATION AT THE READY FOR

01:36:37.525 --> 01:36:39.360
THE ADDRESS PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM

01:36:39.426 --> 01:36:41.128
BUT WE THINK THAT THE PROPOSED

01:36:41.195 --> 01:36:43.497
CONSOLIDATION AUTHORITY FOR AT

01:36:43.564 --> 01:36:45.366
RISK DOMESTIC WELLS IS

01:36:45.432 --> 01:36:47.034
PREMATURE AND SHOULD BE

01:36:47.101 --> 01:36:49.570
DELETED. FONG THE STATE WATER

01:36:49.637 --> 01:36:51.505
BOARD DID JUST RELEASED THAT

01:36:51.572 --> 01:36:53.207
NEEDS ASSESSMENT THAT THE OFFER

01:36:53.274 --> 01:36:55.543
AUTHORED REFERENCED IN IN THAT

01:36:55.609 --> 01:36:56.610
DOCUMENT WHEN THEY'RE TALKING

01:36:56.677 --> 01:36:59.046
ABOUT THE WORK IDENTIFYING THE

01:36:59.113 --> 01:37:01.115
AT RISK WELLS OR THE HIGH RISK

01:37:01.182 --> 01:37:03.884
WELLS THEY SAY THE- THE STATE

01:37:03.951 --> 01:37:06.453
WATER BOARD STAFF STATE. THAT

01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:08.422
THAT DUE TO THE LACK OF DATA

01:37:08.489 --> 01:37:10.224
FROM ACTUAL STATE SMALL WATER

01:37:10.291 --> 01:37:13.060
SYSTEMS AND DOMESTIC WELLS IT'S

01:37:13.127 --> 01:37:14.995
DIFFICULT TO PRECISELY

01:37:15.062 --> 01:37:18.465
DETERMINE THE COUNT OF THE AT

01:37:18.532 --> 01:37:20.734
RISK WELLS. ON THEY KNOW THAT

01:37:20.801 --> 01:37:22.903
THEY USE- PROXY DATA AND

01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:24.939
ASSUMPTIONS AND THE KNOWLEDGE

01:37:25.005 --> 01:37:26.941
THAT THEY HAVE NOT THEY THEY'RE

01:37:27.007 --> 01:37:28.309
NOT USING INFORMATION THAT'S

01:37:28.375 --> 01:37:30.277
BASED ON AN ASSESSMENT OF THE

01:37:30.344 --> 01:37:36.450
COMPLIANCE OF ANY. INDIVIDUAL

01:37:36.517 --> 01:37:37.218
WELL OUR SYSTEM. SO IT'S REALLY

01:37:37.284 --> 01:37:38.919
STE. ND WE DON'T IT FALL.

01:37:38.986 --> 01:37:42.223
AUTHORITY SHOULD BE BASED N A

01:37:42.289 --> 01:37:44.925
SPECULATIVE APPROACH. SO THAT'S

01:37:44.992 --> 01:37:47.161
THE FIRST ISSUE- THE WATER

01:37:47.228 --> 01:37:48.195
BOARD BY THE WAY THEY'RE GOING

01:37:48.262 --> 01:37:50.097
TO WORK ON IMPROVING THE DATA

01:37:50.164 --> 01:37:52.466
AND REFINING THAT RISK

01:37:52.533 --> 01:37:54.201
ASSESSMENT AND THAT'S GREAT BUT

01:37:54.268 --> 01:37:55.636
RIGHT NOW THAT THE STORY WEEKS

01:37:55.703 --> 01:37:58.005
PREMATURE. SO ON THE SECOND

01:37:58.072 --> 01:37:59.673
ISSUE WITH THE PUBLIC PROCESS

01:37:59.740 --> 01:38:02.509
ISSUE THE BILL NOW HAS A GOOD

01:38:02.576 --> 01:38:04.812
PUBLIC PROCESS STEP THAT THE

01:38:04.878 --> 01:38:06.614
POTENTIALLY SUBSUME WATER

01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:09.183
SYSTEM- COULD PROVIDE COMMENTS

01:38:09.250 --> 01:38:11.585
THAT THE SYSTEM IS NOT AT RISK.

01:38:11.652 --> 01:38:13.153
AND IF THE SYSTEM DID SO THE

01:38:13.220 --> 01:38:15.022
WATER BOARD WOULD BE REQUIRED

01:38:15.089 --> 01:38:17.358
DURING A PUBLIC MEETING TO YOU

01:38:17.424 --> 01:38:19.893
KNOW CONSIDER THAT INFORMATION.

01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:22.062
IN IN THEIR DECISION MAKING. WE

01:38:22.129 --> 01:38:24.298
SUGGEST EXPANDING THAT NEW

01:38:24.365 --> 01:38:26.400
PROCESS STEP TO ADDITIONALLY

01:38:26.467 --> 01:38:28.502
ALLOW THE POTENTIALLY RECEIVING

01:38:28.569 --> 01:38:30.037
SYSTEM WHICH WOULD BE

01:38:30.104 --> 01:38:31.905
SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY THE

01:38:31.972 --> 01:38:33.841
ACTION. TO PROVIDE SUCH

01:38:33.907 --> 01:38:37.177
COMMENTS THAT THE SUBSUMED BOND

01:38:37.244 --> 01:38:39.980
SYSTEM IS NOT AT RISK- OR THAT

01:38:40.047 --> 01:38:41.282
YOU KNOW SYSTEM WELLS ARE NOT

01:38:41.348 --> 01:38:43.384
AT RISK AND THEN OF COURSE THE

01:38:43.450 --> 01:38:44.952
DECISION WOULD BE UP TO THE

01:38:45.019 --> 01:38:46.754
STATE WATER BOARD THAT WE THINK

01:38:46.820 --> 01:38:48.222
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PUBLIC

01:38:48.289 --> 01:38:50.624
PROCESS STEP TO ADD. SO THAT

01:38:50.691 --> 01:38:53.294
ANY- CONCLUDES MY TESTIMONY AND

01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:54.995
WE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S

01:38:55.062 --> 01:38:59.166
CONSIDERATION. OF THESE ISSUES

01:38:59.233 --> 01:39:01.302
THANK YOU. EXCELLENT THANK YOU

01:39:01.368 --> 01:39:02.670
IT'S ALWAYS GOOD HEAR FROM

01:39:02.736 --> 01:39:06.006
AQUA. I'LL JUST MAKE A COMMENT

01:39:06.073 --> 01:39:08.275
WHAT THE BOARD IS DOING IS IT'S

01:39:08.342 --> 01:39:10.711
LOOKING AT AREAS WHICH ARE

01:39:10.778 --> 01:39:13.180
KNOWN TO HAVE CONTAMINATION SO

01:39:13.247 --> 01:39:15.649
WITH. THE SITE IS NEAR- ST

01:39:15.716 --> 01:39:18.485
UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANK WHICH

01:39:18.552 --> 01:39:20.554
IS LEAKED- THEY'RE GOING TO

01:39:20.621 --> 01:39:22.089
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT SYSTEM THE

01:39:22.156 --> 01:39:24.425
SYSTEM IS STILL THE- PEOPLE

01:39:24.491 --> 01:39:26.627
USING THE WELL. ARE STILL

01:39:26.694 --> 01:39:31.298
ACTIVE. ABLE TO CHALLENGE THAT.

01:39:31.365 --> 01:39:33.834
AND SHOW THAT IT IS WORTHWHILE

01:39:33.901 --> 01:39:36.670
SO THAT'S THE FIRST OBJECTION-

01:39:36.737 --> 01:39:41.408
THE SECOND ONE I'LL ASK THE-

01:39:41.475 --> 01:39:46.547
AUTHOR TO DISCUSSION OR CLOSE-

01:39:46.613 --> 01:39:50.084
THE R. I'M JUST GOING TO SAY A

01:39:50.150 --> 01:39:52.219
LITTLE BIT ABOUT AND ASK AFTER

01:39:52.286 --> 01:39:55.189
RISK SYSTEMS WE'RE TALKING HERE

01:39:55.255 --> 01:39:58.625
ABOUT MAJOR PROBLEMS- ALREADY

01:39:58.692 --> 01:40:00.461
THE BOARD CAN DEAL WITH-

01:40:00.527 --> 01:40:02.896
FAILING SYSTEMS. UP WHAT DOES

01:40:02.963 --> 01:40:05.332
IT MEAN TO HAVE AN ACT AT RISK

01:40:05.399 --> 01:40:07.935
SYSTEM SO DETERMINING WHICH

01:40:08.001 --> 01:40:09.870
SYSTEMS ARE AT RISK IS A VERY

01:40:09.937 --> 01:40:12.706
COMPLEX RECENT PROCESS THAT THE

01:40:12.773 --> 01:40:14.808
WATER BOARD UCLA DEVELOPED IN

01:40:14.875 --> 01:40:16.477
THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE RISK

01:40:16.543 --> 01:40:19.179
ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY ARE

01:40:19.246 --> 01:40:21.315
WHICH IS PART OF THE TWENTY

01:40:21.382 --> 01:40:22.950
TWENTY ONE NEEDS ASSESSMENT-

01:40:23.016 --> 01:40:27.221
AND- ONE IN PERSON AND FOR

01:40:27.287 --> 01:40:29.456
PUBLIC WOMEN ARE WE SHOULD GO

01:40:29.523 --> 01:40:31.892
WORKSHOPS WERE HELD. IT LOOKS

01:40:31.959 --> 01:40:35.028
AT A NUMBER OF RISK INDICATORS

01:40:35.095 --> 01:40:36.830
IT HAS THRESHOLDS FOR THOSE

01:40:36.897 --> 01:40:39.233
RISKS AND THEN IT DOES SCORES

01:40:39.299 --> 01:40:41.135
AND WAITS BUT THE SORT OF THING

01:40:41.201 --> 01:40:44.304
WE'RE LOOKING AT. IS AND YOU

01:40:44.371 --> 01:40:45.839
KNOW ANY ONE OF THESE I THINK

01:40:45.906 --> 01:40:47.775
AS A REASON TO BE CONCERNED

01:40:47.841 --> 01:40:49.576
HISTORY OF E. COLI PRESENCE

01:40:49.643 --> 01:40:51.512
CREASING THE PRESENCE OF WATER

01:40:51.578 --> 01:40:55.015
QUALITY TRENDS TOWARDS- THE

01:40:55.082 --> 01:40:57.551
MINIMUM. EXCELLENT CONTAMINANT

01:40:57.618 --> 01:40:59.686
LEVEL TREATMENT TECHNIQUES

01:40:59.753 --> 01:41:02.689
VIOLATIONS PAST PRESIDENTS. ON

01:41:02.756 --> 01:41:05.959
THE LIST MAXIMUM DURATION OF

01:41:06.026 --> 01:41:08.595
HIGH POTENTIAL EXPOSURES

01:41:08.662 --> 01:41:11.932
PERCENTAGES SOURCES EXPEDIENT-

01:41:11.999 --> 01:41:14.902
THE MAXIMUM CONTAMINANT-

01:41:14.968 --> 01:41:17.104
ACCESSIBILITY NUMBER OF SOURCES

01:41:17.171 --> 01:41:19.540
ABSENCE OF INTER INTER TIES

01:41:19.606 --> 01:41:22.142
WATER SOURCE TYPES DROUGHT AND

01:41:22.209 --> 01:41:24.077
WATER SHORTAGE RISK CRITICALLY

01:41:24.144 --> 01:41:25.446
OVER DRAFTED GROUNDWATER

01:41:25.512 --> 01:41:28.715
BASINS. AFFORDABILITY PERCENT

01:41:28.782 --> 01:41:30.617
OF THE MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME

01:41:30.684 --> 01:41:32.085
THAT YOU HAVE TO PAY

01:41:32.152 --> 01:41:34.087
STREAMLINER BILLS AND THE

01:41:34.154 --> 01:41:35.956
PERCENT OF SHADOW SO THESE ARE

01:41:36.023 --> 01:41:38.058
VERY- AND THEY'RE ALSO LOOKING

01:41:38.125 --> 01:41:43.230
AT TO. JUST THE NATURE OF THE-

01:41:43.297 --> 01:41:44.698
OUR SYSTEM ITSELF SO THESE ARE

01:41:44.765 --> 01:41:48.302
VERY SERIOUS MATTERS AND IF

01:41:48.368 --> 01:41:50.804
THEY'RE NOT FIXED NOW WE HAVE A

01:41:50.871 --> 01:41:53.440
TREMENDOUS RISK OF PEOPLE BEING

01:41:53.507 --> 01:41:54.408
POISONED BY THE WATER IN THE

01:41:54.475 --> 01:41:57.578
FUTURE. SO IT IS VERY IMPORTANT

01:41:57.644 --> 01:42:02.115
THAT WE GET TOGETHER THESE-

01:42:02.182 --> 01:42:04.852
DISTRICTS SELL THAT- THEY HAVE

01:42:04.918 --> 01:42:06.420
ENOUGH ECONOMIES OF SCALE TO

01:42:06.487 --> 01:42:08.589
FACE THIS ISSUE ALSO THE STATE

01:42:08.655 --> 01:42:10.924
WATER BOARD WILL BE A HAS FUNDS

01:42:10.991 --> 01:42:11.892
TO HELP THEM DO THE

01:42:11.959 --> 01:42:14.628
CONSOLIDATION SO. AGAIN THIS IS

01:42:14.695 --> 01:42:16.430
A VERY SERIOUS MATTER WHEN

01:42:16.497 --> 01:42:18.765
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ASTERISK

01:42:18.832 --> 01:42:19.399
AND I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THAT

01:42:19.466 --> 01:42:23.804
CLEAR- DO WE HAVE ANYONE IN

01:42:23.871 --> 01:42:26.139
OPPOSITION HERE IN THE- OKAY

01:42:26.206 --> 01:42:27.941
NOW WE CAN GO TO THE PHONE

01:42:28.008 --> 01:42:32.212

STATE WATER POLLUTION IS CLEAN

UP. AND ABATEMENT. THAT COUNTS

01:45:32.693 --> 01:45:35.996
WHICH IS RECEIVED ZERO FUNDING

01:45:36.063 --> 01:45:37.998
FROM OUR STATE BODY SINCE WE

01:45:38.065 --> 01:45:40.967
ENACTED IT BACK IN TWENTY

01:45:41.034 --> 01:45:43.236
SEVENTEEN WHICH SPECIFICALLY OF

01:45:43.303 --> 01:45:46.106
THAT BILL IS TO PROVIDE FUNDING

01:45:46.173 --> 01:45:50.677
FOR SUCH AREAS. FIRST THE TO

01:45:50.744 --> 01:45:53.080
THE BILL CITY OF EXETER. OUR

01:45:53.146 --> 01:45:55.315
SITUATION IS A SITUATION VERY

01:45:55.382 --> 01:45:58.018
SIMILAR TO WHAT WE FACED WITH

01:45:58.085 --> 01:46:00.387
EAST SIDE PORT OF ILL VERSUS

01:46:00.454 --> 01:46:03.657
THE CITY OF FORT OF L. THE-

01:46:03.724 --> 01:46:06.093
CITY OF EXETER SIMPLY LACKS THE

01:46:06.159 --> 01:46:09.329
INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE ABILITY.

01:46:09.396 --> 01:46:12.132
TO TIE IN A COMMUNITY THAT IS

01:46:12.199 --> 01:46:17.003
SEVERAL MILES. AWAY FROM THEM.

01:46:17.070 --> 01:46:21.108
SO THE FORCE CONSOLIDATION

01:46:21.174 --> 01:46:23.777
WOULD NOT BE APPROPRIATE WE

01:46:23.844 --> 01:46:26.747
HAVE WORKED WITH THE COUNTY OF

01:46:26.813 --> 01:46:29.015
TULARE WHO HAS JURISDICTION

01:46:29.082 --> 01:46:33.386
OVER. THE COUNTY ISLAND OF TO

01:46:33.453 --> 01:46:36.990
THE BILL AND THE SUPERVISOR AT

01:46:37.057 --> 01:46:38.725
THE TIME WHO WAS SUPERVISOR

01:46:38.792 --> 01:46:40.861
KYLER CROCKER WHO IS NO LONGER

01:46:40.927 --> 01:46:44.064
SUPERVISOR AND WAS VOTED OUT-

01:46:44.131 --> 01:46:45.766
SOME MAY SPECULATE DUE TO HIS

01:46:45.832 --> 01:46:48.368
LACK OF ABILITY IN DEALING WITH

01:46:48.435 --> 01:46:51.438
CERTAIN THINGS- IN HIS IN THE

01:46:51.505 --> 01:46:53.573
ACCESSIBILITY ON CERTAIN ISSUES

01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:55.876
SUCH AS THIS- BUT I WILL NOT

01:46:55.942 --> 01:46:59.212
SPECULATE TO WHY VOTERS CHOSE

01:46:59.279 --> 01:47:01.348
TO REPLACE HIM WITH NOW

01:47:01.414 --> 01:47:03.517
SUPERVISOR LARRY MCCARTY. I

01:47:03.583 --> 01:47:04.618
KNOW BOTH INDIVIDUALS AND

01:47:04.684 --> 01:47:06.820
THEY'RE BOTH GOOD MEN. THE

01:47:06.887 --> 01:47:09.089
SITUATION THOUGH IS THE FACT

01:47:09.156 --> 01:47:11.424
THAT THE COUNTY DEALS WITH THE

01:47:11.491 --> 01:47:13.527
SEWAGE TREATMENT OF THE TWO

01:47:13.593 --> 01:47:15.195
LEGAL COMMUNITY THEY DO WITH

01:47:15.262 --> 01:47:16.930
THE BILLING THEY DEAL WITH ALL

01:47:16.997 --> 01:47:20.801
OF THAT. THE PROBLEM THERE IS

01:47:20.867 --> 01:47:23.370
THAT MANY OF THE HOMES WITHIN

01:47:23.436 --> 01:47:25.705
THE TO REVEAL COMMUNITY. STILL

01:47:25.772 --> 01:47:29.576
RELY ON SEPTIC TANK ISSUES. SO

01:47:29.643 --> 01:47:30.911
THE COUNTY DEALS WITH THAT AND

01:47:30.977 --> 01:47:32.345
DEALS WITH THEIR SEPTIC THEY

01:47:32.412 --> 01:47:33.680
HAVE A SPECIAL DISTRICT

01:47:33.747 --> 01:47:36.483
SPECIFICALLY FOR SEPTIC ISSUES

01:47:36.550 --> 01:47:37.851
THEY ALSO HAVE A SPECIAL

01:47:37.918 --> 01:47:39.286
DISTRICT BILLION WITH THEIR

01:47:39.352 --> 01:47:41.454
WATER IN THERE TO WELLS THAT

01:47:41.521 --> 01:47:42.656
THEY HAVE THAT HAVE

01:47:42.722 --> 01:47:45.859
CONTAMINATION ISSUES PARTIALLY

01:47:45.926 --> 01:47:46.459
IN PART TO THE FAILING SEPTIC

01:47:46.526 --> 01:47:50.530
ISSUES. AGAIN HAVE WORKED ON

01:47:50.597 --> 01:47:54.334
THIS INTIMATELY FOR SEVEN YEARS.

01:47:54.401 --> 01:47:57.103
THE ISSUE THEN BECOMES IF WE DO

01:47:57.170 --> 01:48:00.140
RUN A LINE. TO THE SAID CITY IN

01:48:00.207 --> 01:48:02.242
IN THIS ISN'T SPECIFIC JUST FOR

01:48:02.309 --> 01:48:03.877
THE TO LOUISVILLE THIS IS THE

01:48:03.944 --> 01:48:07.314
SAME STORY ACROSS OUR STATE. IS

01:48:07.380 --> 01:48:10.851
THAT WE HAVE COUNTY ISLANDS.

01:48:10.917 --> 01:48:13.920
THAT SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD. WE

01:48:13.987 --> 01:48:16.423
ALSO HAVE COUNTY ISLANDS THAT

01:48:16.489 --> 01:48:18.458
IN INTO THE BILL'S HISTORY THE

01:48:18.525 --> 01:48:22.863
PAST. FOLKS WHO RAN THEIR WATER

01:48:22.929 --> 01:48:29.336
SYSTEM FRANKLY. IS THERE TO

01:48:29.402 --> 01:48:30.637
SHOW THEY THEY'RE SIMPLY JUST

01:48:30.704 --> 01:48:32.372
DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO DO IT

01:48:32.439 --> 01:48:35.075
BECAUSE THE MONEY THEY DID AT.

01:48:35.141 --> 01:48:35.642
GOBLIN AWAY DUE TO CRIMINAL

01:48:35.709 --> 01:48:38.545
ACTIVITY. AGAIN THIS ISN'T A

01:48:38.612 --> 01:48:42.015
STORY JUST TO THIS SMALL

01:48:42.082 --> 01:48:45.619
COMMUNITY OF TOTALLY THE- NOW

01:48:45.685 --> 01:48:47.053
DO YOU HAVE THE FACT THAT YOU

01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:48.989
HAVE A CITY YOU HAVE A COUNTY

01:48:49.055 --> 01:48:51.591
ISLAND IT. LOGICAL THAT THEY

01:48:51.658 --> 01:48:55.896
TI&lt;c.cyan&gt;. WHO PAYS FOR IT THE&lt;/c&gt;

01:48:55.962 --> 01:48:57.664
FACT IS UNDER CURRENT UTILITY

01:48:57.731 --> 01:49:01.301
CODE MEMBERS AND SENATOR THAT

01:49:01.368 --> 01:49:03.603
IF YOU ADD THAT ADDITIONAL LINE.

01:49:03.670 --> 01:49:05.105
THE NEW PEOPLE TIED INTO THAT

01:49:05.171 --> 01:49:06.907
LINE ARE NOW FINANCIALLY

01:49:06.973 --> 01:49:08.375

01:49:08.441 --> 01:49:11.978
LINE. THAT'S UTILITY COAT AS IT

01:49:12.045 --> 01:49:16.349
CURRENTLY STANDS. CHAU THE

01:49:16.416 --> 01:49:18.618
PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THAT THE

01:49:18.685 --> 01:49:21.221
SMALL COUNTY ISLANDS SIMPLY

01:49:21.288 --> 01:49:23.890
CANNOT AFFORD THAT ADDITIONAL

01:49:23.957 --> 01:49:25.859
COST BECAUSE THEY ALREADY CAN'T

01:49:25.926 --> 01:49:27.827
AFFORD THE WATER SYSTEMS THAT

01:49:27.894 --> 01:49:29.930
THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO GET FIXED

01:49:29.996 --> 01:49:32.899
WE HAVE SEEN THIS ON THE MISTER

ACROSS THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY-

01:49:41.508 --> 01:49:43.610
NOW U. S. SENATOR ALEX VIDEO

01:49:43.677 --> 01:49:44.811
ACTUALLY BEEN WITH HIM OUT AT

01:49:44.878 --> 01:49:46.446
SOME WE HAVE SEEN WATER

01:49:46.513 --> 01:49:48.581
TREATMENT PLANTS PUT IN TO DO A

01:49:48.648 --> 01:49:49.749
ARSENIC ISSUES TO DEAL WITH

01:49:49.816 --> 01:49:51.818
NITROGEN ISSUES TO DEAL WITH

01:49:51.885 --> 01:49:54.220
THE TOXICITY ISSUES. THAT THESE

01:49:54.287 --> 01:49:56.723
COMMUNITIES FACE AND THE FACT

01:49:56.790 --> 01:49:58.024
IS MANY OF THESE PLANTS ARE

01:49:58.091 --> 01:50:00.293
MOTHBALLED BECAUSE THE

01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:01.728
COMMUNITIES THAT THEY ARE PUT

01:50:01.795 --> 01:50:06.199
INTO SERVICE CANNOT AFFORD. TO

PAY TO RUN THE TREATMENT PLANTS

01:50:08.201 --> 01:50:09.369
AND THEY CANNOT AFFORD THE

01:50:09.436 --> 01:50:12.339
WATER THAT THE TREATMENT PLANTS

01:50:12.405 --> 01:50:12.906
PRODUCE FOR THEIR HOMES AND

01:50:12.973 --> 01:50:15.742
THEIR FAMILIES. WHICH LEADS ME

01:50:15.809 --> 01:50:17.610
TO THE POINT. WITH ASSEMBLY

SYSTEM THAT'S ALREADY DEALING

01:52:42.155 --> 01:52:44.891
WITH CITY AND SEWAGE. BECAUSE

01:52:44.958 --> 01:52:46.426
THOSE INFRASTRUCTURES HAVE TO

01:52:46.493 --> 01:52:47.760
BE LOOKED AT AS WELL BECAUSE

01:52:47.827 --> 01:52:49.429

COUNTY NEEDS TO BE RESPONSIBLE

01:53:06.346 --> 01:53:08.014
FOR PART OF THIS. WE KNOW THERE

01:53:08.081 --> 01:53:09.082
ARE MULTIPLE DIFFERENT PIECES

01:53:09.149 --> 01:53:11.117
THAT HAVE TO BE DONE IN

01:53:11.184 --> 01:53:14.187
THREADED THAT NEEDLE JUST RIGHT

IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THESE

01:53:16.523 --> 01:53:18.424
THINGS WORK. AND WE HAVE TO BE

01:53:18.491 --> 01:53:24.264
VERY. THOUGHTFUL. I'M THINKING

01:53:24.330 --> 01:53:25.532
ABOUT IT'S NOT JUST

01:53:25.598 --> 01:53:28.501
CONSOLIDATING WATER. IT'S WATER

01:53:28.568 --> 01:53:30.270
IN SEWAGE TOGETHER WATER

01:53:31.838 --> 01:53:32.939
COME OUT OF THE HOUSE IT'S GOT

01:53:33.006 --> 01:53:35.041
TO GO TO A TREATMENT PLAN HAS

01:53:35.108 --> 01:53:35.608
GOT TO GO THROUGH ALL THESE

01:53:35.675 --> 01:53:37.710
DIFFERENT LITTLE STEPS. THAT

01:53:37.777 --> 01:53:38.311
FRANKLY I DON'T SEE IN THIS

01:53:38.378 --> 01:53:39.913

01:53:39.979 --> 01:53:41.548
MORE THAN HAPPY SENATOR TO WORK

01:53:49.856 --> 01:53:51.291
HAVE TIME IN THIS SESSION TO

01:53:51.357 --> 01:53:53.092
MAKE THIS BETTER BUT THERE ARE

01:53:53.159 --> 01:53:53.993
THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE

01:53:54.060 --> 01:53:55.828

01:54:13.279 --> 01:54:15.782
ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES

01:54:15.848 --> 01:54:18.785
THAT- THREE GOOD ASSEMBLY

01:54:18.851 --> 01:54:21.120
MEMBER BROUGHT UP IT IS UP TO

01:54:21.187 --> 01:54:23.523
THE WATER BOARD TO DECIDE ON

01:54:23.590 --> 01:54:24.791
THESE THINGS I DON'T KNOW ABOUT

01:54:24.857 --> 01:54:28.695
CONSOLIDATING THE SEWER SYSTEM.

01:54:28.761 --> 01:54:29.829

AS- FOR EXAMPLE THE ENTIRE TIME.

01:54:34.033 --> 01:54:35.969

CONSOLIDATE UNLESS THERE WERE

01:54:37.837 --> 01:54:40.206

ABILITY TO PAY FOR THAT INNER

01:54:42.575 --> 01:54:44.410
