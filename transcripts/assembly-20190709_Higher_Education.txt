GOOD AFTERNOON I WANT TO WELCOME LINDSEY MITCHELL THE NEW REPUBLICAN CAUCUS CONSULTANT COVERING THE COMMITTEE. WELCOME TO LINDSEY. SO TODAY WE HAVE TO MEASURES ON THE AGENDA. PLEASE NOTE THAT OUR GENERAL GUIDELINE FOR BILLS HEARD IN THIS COMMITTEE IS TO ALLOW TESTIMONY. FOR TWO WITNESSES FOR SUPPORT AND TWO WITNESSES IN THE OPPOSITION TO SPEAK EACH FOR TWO MINUTES. STAKEHOLDER GROUPS AND ENTITIES THAT ARE NEITHER IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION WILL BE ALLOWED TO GIVE TESTIMONY. FOR NO MORE THAN TWO MINUTES. WHEN I CALL FOR TWEETERS? THE MEASURE HAS MORE THAN TWO ENTITIES THAT WIENER CATEGORY ONLY TWO WILL BE ALLOWED. TO SPEAK FOR TWO MINUTES EACH. AND FIRST ON THE AGENDA AT AGENDA ITEM ONE AS BE TWO ZERO SIX SENATORS CAN. WELCOME QUITE JOINT AUTHORS WELCOME BOTH. YOU MAY BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY CENTERS CAN. YOU SO MUCH -- MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS -- ARE MY JOIN NOT THERE WILL ALSO BE OPENING AND THEN WE WILL HEAR FROM OUR WITNESSES AND I HAVE A TECHNICAL EXPERT IN CASE THERE ARE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SO SB TWO OH SIX FIRST I WILL BE TAKING THE AMENDMENTS THAT -- WE HAVE DISCUSSED WITH THE COMMITTEE. THERE WAS AMENDMENTS RECOGNIZED THAT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM IS NOT A MEMBER OF THE NC TWO WAY. AND THAT'S IS NOT TECHNICALLY GOVERNED BY THEIR RULES -- AND SO THE BILL ALLOWS FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM -- TO FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ESTABLISH A STAKEHOLDER GROUP THAT INVOLVES THE COMMUNICORP SYSTEM PLUS SOME APPOINTEES OF THE LEGISLATURE. TO DISCUSS THEIR RULE CHANGE -- TO IF THIS BILL IS SUCCESSFUL TO BE COMPARABLE TO THE ROLE CHANGE THAT WE ARE THAN TRYING TO AFFECT FOR OUR OTHER CAMPUSES. RECOGNIZING THAT AGAIN AS MENTIONED THAT THE COMMITTEE CALLED SYSTEM IS DIFFERENT AND IT'S ALSO A TWO YEAR SYSTEM SO. I APPRECIATE THE INTERACTION WITH THE CHAIR TO MAKE THOSE GOOD AMENDMENTS. NOW. SB TWO OH SIX WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS GIVE OUR STUDENT ATHLETES THE SAME RIGHTS THAT OLYMPIC ATHLETES HAVE. AND THE SAME RIGHT THE EACH AND EVERYONE OF US HAVE UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW AND THAT IS THE RIGHT TO OUR OWN NAME IMAGE AND LIKENESS NO ONE ELSE UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW CAN MARKET YOUR NAME IMAGE OR LIKENESS. WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION. ONLY STUDENT ATHLETES ARE PREVENTED FROM THE ACT. SB TWO OH SIX DOES NOT REQUIRE SCHOOLS TO PAY ATHLETES DIRECTLY. PURELY GIVES THEM THE RIGHT TO THEIR OWN NAME IMAGE AND LIKENESS SOME ATHLETES MAY CHOOSE NOT TO EXERCISE THAT RIGHT. OTHERS WILL. BUT I ASK YOU. IMAGINE IF ANY OTHER BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY. FOR EXAMPLE TV OR MOVIES RELY. ON COLLEGE STUDENTS AS THEIR PRIMARY SOURCE OF TALENT FOR THE REVENUE OF THEIR INDUSTRY YET DENIED THOSE STUDENTS ANY COMPENSATION. THERE WOULD BE UNIVERSAL OUTCRY NOW SOME OF YOU MAY BE THINKING BUT WAIT A MINUTE. STUDENT ATHLETES GET SCHOLARSHIPS. IF YOU LOOK AT ALL OF OUR COLLEGES OWN DATA. OVER HALF OF STUDENT ATHLETES GET NO SCHOLARSHIP IN OUR PRESENTATION TO THE LAST ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE WE HAD ERIN CAFARO. A ROWER FOR CAL. TWO TIME OLYMPIAN [inaudible] WHO? AT HER FOR YEARS A CAL. SHE WROTE ALL FOUR YEARS QUALIFIED FOR THE OLYMPICS SHE DID NOT GET A SCHOLARSHIP TO HER SENIOR YEAR AND IT WAS PARTIAL. AND YET WITH HER ROWING SCHEDULE. AND HER ACADEMICS SHE COULD NOT HAVE A PART TIME JOB. SHE HAD NO ABILITY TO REALLY COVER ALL OF HEREXPENSES. ON SO OF COURSE SHE WAS HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL -- ANYWAY. YOU HAVE A LETTER FROM THE FORMER CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF THE NC TWO WAY DâN BOGAN WHO IS ALSO A FORMER VICE CHANCELLOR OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION AT UC BERKELEY. WHO IS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IN WHO WRITES THAT ONE OF THE KEY REASONS THAT HE BACKS THE BILL IS BECAUSE? DE NC TO RAISE RULES ARE CONTRADICTORY TO A CORE TENET OF THEIR OWN BYLAWS. AND THEIR OWN BYLAWS STATE. THAT THEIR RULES MUST ASSURE THAT ATHLETIC PARTICIPANTS ARE NOT TREATED DIFFERENTLY FROM ANY OTHER MEMBER OF THE STUDENT BODY. AND YET BY DENYING STUDENTS ANY ABILITY TO MARKET THEIR OWN NAME IMAGE AND LIKENESS THEY'RE TREATING THEM DIFFERENTLY. AND I WANT TO MAKE A SIMPLE POINT BECAUSE VERY OFTEN WE THINK IMMEDIATELY OF THE ELITE ATHLETE AND WE THINK WELL THIS IS JUST GOING TO ALLOW A FEW STUDENTS TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY. BUT LET'S GIVE THE EXAMPLE OF THAT YOUNG PERSON WHO IS THE STAR ATHLETE FROM THEIR SMALL TOWN. AND THEY THEY ARE THE BIGGEST THING THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE JUST CELEBRATED IN THEIR SMALL TOWN. AND THEY GO OFF TO COLLEGE IN THERE MAYBE IN A MINOR SPORT. THEY DON'T GET A SCHOLARSHIP BUT PERHAPS THERE. A LOCAL CAR DEALERSHIP OR THEIR CORNICE CLUBBER THEIR ROTARY CLUB WANTS TO SPONSOR THEM HELP THEM SUPPORT THEM TO GO TO SCHOOL. THAT'S STUDENT WOULD BE DENIED. ANOTHER EXAMPLE YOU'RE THE HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL STAR. YOU'RE NOT THAT GOOD FOR GOING OFF TO PRO OR EVEN BEING AN ELITE SCHOOL BUT YOU'RE REALLY IMPORTANT YOUR TOWN. YOU CAN'T COME BACK AND COACH FOR TRAIN THE OTHER HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS FOR ANY KIND OF COMPENSATION YOU CAN'T RUN A SPORTS CAMP FOR ANY COMPENSATION. ALL BECAUSE OF THE NC TO A ROLES WHY WOULD WE DENY THAT. AND ESPECIALLY WHEN WITH THE AMOUNT OF PRESSURE ON STUDENT ATHLETES IN THE TIME IT TAKES FOR THEM TO KEEP UP WITH THEIR SPORT. THEY REALLY CAN'T HAVE PART TIME JOBS. SO LET ME STOP AND TURN IT OVER TO MY AUTHOR. SENATOR BRADFORD. THANK YOU MISTER MEMBERS AND FIRST LET ME THANK -- SOONER SKINNER FOR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE SB TOOL -- SIX I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IS TO CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE OF TODAY WHEN IT COMES. TO ATHLETES AND SPORTS HERE AND AMERICA. IT'S ABOUT FAIRNESS THIS IS NOT A ISSUE OF SPORTS IT'S ABOUT FAIRNESS IT'S ABOUT ALLOWING THESE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT SMALL WINDOW. THAT MIGHT PROJECTED PRESENT ITSELF FOR THEM TO MONETIZE THEIR NAME IMAGE AND LIKENESS. AND ADDS SENATOR SKINNER STATED THE MAJORITY OF THESE ATHLETES WILL NEVER GO PRO. ONLY 2% OF COLLEGE ATHLETES EVER MAKE IT TO THE PRO LEVEL AND MANY OF THEM HAVE CAREERS LESS THAN THREE YEARS. CHAU SEEING THAT AS A COLLEGE ATHLETE WERE YOU ARE FILLING ARENAS AND STADIUMS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY WERE USE. SELLING SEATS AND HELPING SELL MERCHANDISE THAT YOU BENEFIT NOT ONE IOTA OTHER THAN YES YOU GET A SCHOLARSHIP [inaudible] BUT I WENT TO COLLEGE WITH PLENTY OF SCHOLARSHIP ATHLETES WHO STRUGGLE TO MAKE ENDS MEET FROM MONTH TO MONTH. MANY BORROWED MONEY FROM ME ON A REGULAR BASIS TO PUT. GAS IN THE CAR IF THEY HAD A CAR AND MANY OF THEM DID HAVE CARS BUT THE BY MAIL OR SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE SO A SCHOLARSHIP IN AND OF ITSELF. DOESN'T TAKE CARE OF ALL THE NECESSITIES THAT YOU NEED TO SURVIVE -- OUTSIDE A ROOM AND BOARD AND I TUITION TO LOT MORE EXPENSES AS YOU KNOW TO GO TO COLLEGE NOWADAYS SO -- AGAIN THIS IS THE ISSUE OF FAIRNESS AND AS I SAID CIVIL RIGHTS BECAUSE OF 3% OF THE UNDERGRADUATE POPULATION AFRICAN AMERICANS MAKE UP JUST 3% OF THE UNDERGRADUATE -- Và UNIVERSITY IN COLLEGE POPULATION BUT THEY MAKE UP OVER 50%. OF THE ATHLETES THAT PLAYED FOOTBALL AND BASKETBALL AT THESE MAJOR UNIVERSITIES MANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS COME FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES. BUT THEY'RE RECRUITED BY COACHES NOW WILL MAKE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS COACHES NOW MAKE MORE THAN COLLEGE PRESIDENTS. COACHES WHO ARE ABLE. TO MONETIZE THEIR IMAGE IN THEIR LIKENESS BECAUSE MANY OF THEM HAVE ENDORSEMENT DEALS. AND THAT. MAKES IT VERY ATTRACTIVE AND THAT'S PART OF THE NEGOTIATIONS OF COME TO ME OF THESE COLLEGES THEIR ABILITY TO MONETIZE INTO -- ADVERTISING AND MARKETING AND OTHER -- ENDORSEMENTS ON THE SIDE -- TALK SHOWS PODCASTS YOU NAME IT -- COACHES TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS ATHLETES CAN'T HAVE THAT SAME OPPORTUNITY SO. AGAIN -- THIS IS ABOUT. AGAIN FAIRNESS AND MAKING SURE THAT THESE ATHLETES DON'T STRUGGLE TO STAND IN COLLEGE AND AS SENATOR SKINNER STATED THIS WILL NOT AFFECT THE UNIVERSITY NOT ONE IOTA NOT ONE DIME BECAUSE OF HIS SPONSOR WANTS. TO PAY THEM FOR THAT AGAIN IT DOESN'T COME OUT OF THE COLLEGE KATIE WHATSOEVER COLLEGES WILL NOT BE PAYING FOR THAT IT WOULD BE THE INDIVIDUAL. COMPANY OUR BUSINESS WHO FEELS THAT THIS INDIVIDUALS ARE WORTHY OF AN ENDORSEMENT DEAL OR ARE THE SPONSORSHIP. AND IT IS ALSO GOING TO HAVE PEOPLE SAY WELL IT'S GOING TO ENCOURAGE FOLKS TO LEAVE COLLEGE YOUNG STUDENTS TO STAY IN COLLEGE. BECAUSE AGAIN IF THEY CAN MONETIZE THEIR WORK WHILE THEY'RE THEY WON'T BE DOING THE ONE AND DONE WE ALL. READ ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE DIANE WILLIAMSON. ONE AND DONE. THE LAST BASKETBALL GAME HE PLAYED IN TICKETS SOLD FOR THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A SEAT. THEY SURELY WASN'T PAYING TO SEE THE BLUE DEVIL MASCOT THEY WERE COMING TO SEE CYAN WILLIAMS TO PLAY BASKETBALL. THESE KIDS FILL ARENAS THEY FILL SEATS AND AGAIN THIS IS OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT SMALL WINDOW. AND AS WE SEE IN BASKETBALL MANY OF THESE KIDS SOMETIMES SKIP COLLEGE ALTOGETHER BECAUSE OF THE MONETARY OPPORTUNITIES IN THE NBA WE SIDE WITH THE LEBRON JAMES WE SAW WOULD KOBE BRYANT. KEVIN GARNETT. IN MANY OTHERS WHO JUST BYPASS COLLEGE ALTOGETHER BECAUSE OF THE FINANCIAL NEEDS IN THE BE ABLE TO HELP A SISTER FAMILY SO. AGAIN. BUT THIS I I WISH AS I STATED THIS BILL DOES MORE BUT I THINK IT'S A COMMONSENSE MEASURE THAT'S ABOUT FAIRNESS AND OPPORTUNITY AND I HOUSE AFTER PROPER TIME FOR RIVAL. THANK YOU. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT LET ME INTRODUCE SO QUICKLY SO THEY DON'T USE THAT TIME. WE HAVE -- HEALY HODSON WHO IS A STANFORD -- VOLLEYBALL PLAYER. AND WE HAVE RUSSELL A **** WHO IS THE CURRENT NFL LEFT TACKLE FOR THE LA CHARGERS AND A SUPER BOWL CHAMPION [inaudible] WELCOME. HELLO OF I'M SORRY BEFORE YOU BEGIN WE'RE GOING TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM. ONE ONE SIX MEDINA PRESENT CHOI. ARAMBULA. BLOOM. GABRIEL [inaudible] IRWIN KILEY [inaudible] LEVINE [inaudible] LOW [inaudible] PATTERSON. SANTIAGO. WEBER [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] THAT. FOR A QUORUM IS PRESENT. WELCOME. AND YOU MAY BEGIN EACH WILL HAVE TWO MINUTES. GOOD AFTERNOON -- I'M A FORMER STANFORD WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL PLAYER SENATOR SKIN IT SKINNER MENTIONED -- COMING OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL I WAS THE TOP RANKED RECRUIT IN THE NATION AND A PLAYER ON THE USA WOMEN'S NATIONAL TEAM. I WENT ON TO EARN ALL AMERICAN THE NATIONAL FRESHMAN OF THE YEAR HONORS DURING MY FIRST YEAR AT STANFORD. UNFORTUNATELY FOR ME HOWEVER. I SUFFERED TWO CONCUSSIONS AND ENSUING COMPLICATIONS DURING MY FIRST SEASON AT STANFORD WHICH LED TO MY MEDICAL RETIREMENT AT AGE TWENTY MY CAREER WAS OVER BEFORE IT EVEN STARTED. LIKE MOST COLLEGE ATHLETES MY FAMILY HAS MADE MANY FINANCIAL SACRIFICES OVER THE YEARS IN ORDER TO HELP ME PROGRESS IS BOTH THE STUDENT AND AN ATHLETE. BUT NOW THAT MY CAREER IS OVER IT IS CLEAR THAT EVEN BEING ONE OF THE TOP PLAYERS IN A SPORT WITH PROFESSIONAL OPPORTUNITIES DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT THOSE INVESTMENT OF TIME. AND MONEY WILL PAY OFF. THE NCAA PROFITS FROM THE PERFORMANCE AND LABOR OF MINORS AND YOUNG ADULTS WHILE DENYING THOSE SAME PERFORMERS THE RIGHT TO EARN MONEY BASED ON THEIR ATHLETIC TALENTS AND SUCCESSES THROUGH OTHER MEANS. IN FACT THE NCAA HAS A MONOPOLY ON THE ADVERTISING AND PUBLICITY RIGHTS OF ALL AMATEUR ATHLETES IN THE COUNTRY. WELL SB TWO OH SIX WOULD HELP ALL CALIFORNIA ATHLETES IT WOULD PARTICULARLY BENEFIT WOMEN. THE END SAY IS STILL THE PREMIER ATHLETIC PLATFORM FOR MOST FEMALE ATHLETES IN AMERICA BUT UNIVERSITIES HAVE CHOSEN TO MAKE MEN'S FOOTBALL AND BASKETBALL TEAMS THEIR PRIORITIES. FEMALE ATHLETES WHO ARE THE BEST IN THEIR SPORTS TO PHYSICALLY HAVE FEWER PROFESSIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AFTER COLLEGE AS THEIR MALE COUNTERPARTS IN WOULD BENEFIT QUICK GREATLY FROM BEING ABLE TO MARKET THEMSELVES DURING COLLEGE. FOR THE 98% OF COLLEGE ATHLETES THAT WILL NEVER GO PRO COLLEGE IS THE ONLY TIME THEY HAVE TO PROFIT OFF THEIR HARD EARNED ATHLETICS SUCCESSES AND THEY ARE CURRENTLY DENIED THAT OPPORTUNITY. NO OTHER COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE TREATED THIS WAY MUSICIANS DANCERS ACTORS AND OTHER COLLEGE STUDENTS WITH ACT ATHLETIC ARTISTIC OR ENTREPRENEUR YOUR TALENTS HAVE NO RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR EARNING CAPACITIES. IN HIGH SCHOOL I HAD TO TURN DOWN STIPENDS ENDORSEMENTS AND EVEN A TV SHOW PRIOR TO COLLEGE IN ORDER TO STAY ELIGIBLE TO PLAY IN THE NCAA. I WAS ON TRACK TO BE ONE OF THE FEW COLLEGE ATHLETES THAT WOULD HAVE HAD A PROFESSIONAL CAREER. BUT BECAUSE I RECEIVED A CAREER ENDING IN LIFE CHANGING BRAIN INJURY DURING COLLEGE. I NEVER GOT TO SEE ALL OF MY HARD WORK IN MY FAMILY SACRIFICES PAY OFF AND I'M NOT ALONE MORE THAN 50% OF DIVISION ONE COLLEGE ATHLETE SUFFER FROM CHRONIC SPORTS INJURIES. AND WILL BE FACING PAIN AND MEDICAL BILLS FOR THE RIGHTS OF THEIR LIVES BECAUSE OF THEIR PARTICIPATION IN NCAA SPORTS. MY HOPE IS THAT SB TWO OH SIX WOULD BEGIN TO PROVIDE ATHLETES OF EVERY BACKGROUND A CHANCE TO EARN BACK EVEN JUST A LITTLE OF WHAT THEY SACRIFICE FOR THEIR SCHOOLS. EVEN EVERY SINGLE ATHLETE DESERVES A CHANCE TO MONETIZE HIS OR HER HARD WORK AND TALENT IF YOU'RE STATE SHE CHOOSES TO DO SO. IT IS NEVER ENOUGH TO HAVE LESS THAN EQUAL PUBLICITY RIGHTS OR BE DENIED THE ECONOMIC AND CIVIL RIGHTS PROTECTIONS AFFORDED TO ALL OTHER AMERICANS. THE COMMITTEE TO VOTE YES THANK YOU. YEP -- JUNE TWENTY EIGHTH TWO DOT TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN IT WAS A VERY SPECIAL DAY FOR ME. AT FIVE THIRTY SEVEN FIVE THIRTY SEVEN EIGHT POUNDS THREE OUNCES MCPHERSON WAS BORN. WHILE HOLDING MY NEWBORN SON AMOUNTS FOR THE FIRST TIME ASK MYSELF A QUESTION WHICH I BELIEVE EVERYONE AT THE POINT IN THEIR LIFE TO ASK. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO THE LIFE THAT YOU HAVE LEFT WHEN YOU'RE EXPOSED OPPORTUNITY GIVES YOU OPTIONS OPTIONS REQUIRE DECISIONS AS REFLECT ON THIS DECISION THAT WE MAKE TODAY? HOW SHAPE THE FUTURE ARE JUST COMMITTEE TO RECOGNIZE ENORMOUS STAKES THIS BILL PRESENTS -- FOR COUNTLESS ATHLETES MARK EMMERT OF THE NC DOUBLE A CLAIM TO CALIFORNIA'S BILL TO RETURN THE RIGHTS. AND NAMES IMAGES AND LIKE MR COLLEGE ATHLETES QUOTE THREATENS TO ALTER MATERIALLY PRINCIPLES OF INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETICS HE IS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT. THE SO CALLED PRINCIPLES OF INSTEAD OF WHAT SHOULD BE MATERIALLY ALTERED AS THEY ARE FAR FROM VIRTUOUS. THEY ARE IN FACT ROOTED IN LONG STANDING PRACTICES OF EXPLOITATION OPPRESSION AND A BLACK LABOR WHICH HAS EMBEDDED IN BEEN EMBEDDED AMERICAN HISTORY SINCE THE INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY. ABOUT ONE HUNDRED SIXTY TWO YEARS AGO THE INFAMOUS DRED SCOTT DECISION OF THE SUPREME COURT HELD THAT THE CONSTITUTION WAS NOT MEANT TO INCLUDE AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP PROVIDE PEOPLE. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY WERE ENSLAVED OR FREE THEREFORE THE RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES IT CONFERS UPON AMERICAN CITIZEN SHOULD NOT APPLY TO BLACK PEOPLE A DECADE LATER. THE THIRTEEN THE MEMBER ABOLISHED SLAVERY AND INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE EXCEPT AS PUNISHMENT FOR CRIME WERE OF THE PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN DULY. CONVICTED BUDGET DEFICIT DESCRIBE HOW TO ACCEPT INTO THE THE LETTER TO RISE A WIDESPREAD CONVICT LEASING SYSTEM. WHICH UNDERMINE THE FUNCTION OF THE THIRTEEN MM HE SAID I QUOTE. THE STATE CRIME REPORT MADE TO MAINTAIN STATE CONVICTS WITHIN PRISON WALLS HAS THE CONVICTS RELEASED OUT THE WORK FOR ROADWAY -- CONTRACTORS MINING COMPANIES AND THOSE WHO FARM LARGE PLANTATIONS. 90% OF THE COMPLEX DOUG WAS ONE THAT WERE BLACK. TODAY THE FREE MARKET SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES WORK FOR EVERYONE BUT TWO GROUPS OF PEOPLE THE APTLY AND THE PRESIDENT. BOTH PARTIES TO PROVIDE OF ROOM FOOD BOARD. AND SOME EVEN GET EDUCATION BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY BOTH PARTIES ARE DENIED THE RIGHT TO SIGNIFICANT COMPENSATION FOR THE LABOR. BY NO MEANS AM I SUGGESTING THAT STUDENT ATHLETES ARE SLAVES AGAINST THEIR WILL. BUT I CAN'T HELP BUT TO WONDER WHAT CRIME HAVE THEY COMMITTED TO DESERVE BEING ALIENATED FROM THE FINANCIAL FRUITS OF THEIR LABOR WHAT IS A FREE MARKET SYSTEM WORK FOR EVERYONE. BUT EXCEPT THE ATHLETE. IN A LETTER SUBMITTED TO THIS COMMITTEE COMMITTEE MY MENTOR AND FORMER NBA MVP EXACT DIRECTOR CHARLES GRANTHAM HIGHLIGHTS HOW THIS TO NATALIE TURN BEGAN AS A WAY FOR INTO THE WAY TO AVOID WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS. THIS RATIONALE WAS EMITTED BY NONE OTHER THAN THE PERSON WHO INVENTED THE TERM WALTER BYERS. EVEN IF WE CONCEDE. THAT WAS ARGUMENT THAT STUDENT ATHLETES ARE STUDENTS FIRST AT THE SECOND LET'S EXAMINE THE RIGHTS OF THE AVERAGE STUDENT. EFFORT STUDENT WORKS ARE JOB ON CAMPUS THEY'RE ALLOWED TO MAKE AN HOUR'S PROBABLY WAGE IF THE STUDENT IS GOOD A CHEMISTRY AND CHOOSE THE TUTOR. THEY CAN CHARGE MONEY FOR THIS STUDENTS ARE ALLOWED TO MAKE MONEY FROM THEIR PRESS SPECIALIZED SKILLS. BUT STUDENT ATHLETES EXPLICITLY PROHIBITED ARE PROHIBITED FROM DOING. ANYTHING WITH A SPECIALIZED SKILLS FOR MOMENT [inaudible] PLEASE PONDERED. WHOSE RIGHTS TO THE ATHLETES HAVE MORE SIMPLISTIC. SLAVES OF PRISONERS OR THE STUDENT BODY. THIS RIGHT THIS FIGHT OVER THIS BILL IS A SOLELY -- ABOUT MAKING MONEY IT'S NOT ABOUT CHAMPIONSHIPS IT'S IT'S IT'S ABOUT IT'S NOT ABOUT SCHOOL SPIRIT. IT'S ABOUT HOT ONGOING FIGHT -- FOR THAT WE SERVICE SPECIALLY ASK A COUPLE PEOPLE HIS NATION. IS ABOUT BASIC CIVIL LIBERTIES. AND THAT REPRESSIVE MEASURES STILL EXIST UNTIL TUESDAY. DO WE AS A SOCIETY. SEE COLLEGE ATHLETES AS FULL CITIZENS OR SUGAR LABOR CONTINUE TO BE SHAMEFUL EXPORTED USING OUTDATED LOGIC THAT'S ROOTED IN SLAVERY. ARE THE ASSETS THAT EXIST FOR MERE PRESENCE. FOR OTHER HUMAN BEINGS WHICH HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS AS ANYONE ELSE THANK YOU. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. WITH THIS IS IN OPPOSITION NOT WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OTHER SUPPORT -- I'M SORRY.

NOW WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION AND IF WE COULD PLEASE MAKE ROOM FOR THANK YOU CHAIRMAN MEDINA COMMITTEE MEMBERS TYLER REGULAR BE AFTER THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA -- WE ARE RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION I WANT TO THANK THE TWO FORMER TESTIMONIES. WE APPRECIATE YOU SHARE THE AUTHOR'S INTEREST -- IN STUDENT OUT THE WELFARE YOU SEE TAKES GREAT PRIDE IN BEING A LEADER IN THIS AREA I UC'S COMMITTED TO PROTECTING SEA WELFARE OF STUDENT ATHLETES IN A TWENTY SIXTEEN WENT BEYOND STATE REQUIREMENTS AND ADOPTED PRINCIPLES OF POLICY CHANGES. TO BETTER PREPARE ADVISED PROTECTED ENSURE THE SUCCESS. AND WELFARE OF ALL YOU SEE STUDENT ATHLETES UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL STILL CREATES A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE ARE STILL NOW THAT THAT YOU SEE COULD BE IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF NC DOUBLE THE BY LAWS AS THEY ARE CURRENTLY WRITTEN. I JUST TWO MONTHS AGO THE NC DOUBLE A ANNOUNCED IT FOR NATIONAL WORKING GROUP ON THE ISSUE OF NAME IMAGE AND LIKENESS. COMPOSED OF UNIVERSITY PRESIDENTS ATHLETIC DIRECTORS CONFERENCE COMMISSIONERS AS WELL AS NC DOUBLE A STUDENT ATHLETES FROM DIVISION ONE TWO AND THREE PROGRAMS. OF OUR REPORT IS DUE BACK TO THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS IN OCTOBER WITH AN UPDATE PROVIDED NEXT MONTH IN AUGUST. GIVEN THE SENSITIVELY PROCESS THAT IS CURRENTLY UNDER WAY -- TO FURTHER EXPORTER YOU THE EXTREME COMPLEXITY OF THIS ISSUE -- THE UNIVERSITY CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT IT'S PREMATURE TO PROMOTE LEGISLATION THIS AREA AT THIS TIME -- IF CALIFORNIA WANTS TO MAKE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES TO THE EXISTING LANDSCAPE OF COLLEGIATE ATHLETICS AS WE KNOW IT TODAY. WE HAVE TO BE SURE THAT WE ARE MAKING A DECISION THAT WILL NOT HAVE ANY UNFORESEEN OR NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES ON STUDENT ATHLETES IN CALIFORNIA TODAY. IN CLOSING LET ME AGAIN NOTE THAT YOU SEE APPRECIATE THE ATTENTION AND CONCERN FOR STUDENT ATHLETES BUT IT FOR THE REASONS STATED WE HAVE TO RESPECTFULLY COULD CONTINUE TO BE OPPOSED -- I'M DEAL THE REST OF MY TIME TO ANTI FEE. DIRECTOR ATHLETICS AT LONG BEACH STATE UNIVERSITY. THANK YOU TYLER AND THANK EVERYBODY FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY. I CURRENTLY SERVE AS THE ATHLETIC DIRECTOR AT LONG BEACH STATE UNIVERSITY I'M HERE TODAY IN OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL. NOT NECESSARILY THE CONVERSATION. I BRIEFLY WANT TO SHARE MY THOUGHTS THERE ARE MANY POTENTIAL UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES -- WHICH IN THE END COULD HARM THE VERY STUDENTS -- THAT THE AUTHOR'S INTENT TO HELP. THERE IS A POSSIBLE SCENARIO WITH AUTHORS WORLD WORKS AND THERE MIGHT NOT BE ANY NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO SEVERAL POSSIBLE IMPACTS WHICH WOULD LEAVE A HARSH FOOT PRINT POSSIBLY. THE IRST COULD BE A WORLD WHERE CALIFORNIAN OVERSEAS ARE RESTRICTED FROM COMPETING FOR NC DOUBLE A CHAMPIONSHIPS. WITH OVER TWENTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE WORKING IN NC DOUBLE A I DON'T BELIEVE THE TWO WORLDS CAN CO EXIST. I DON'T THINK YOU CAN HAVE ONE WORLD WHERE THE RULES SAY AXE AND THE OTHER WORLD SAYS WHY AND WE MEET ON THE SAME FEEL THE COMPETITION. I THINK THEY'RE DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED. AS A MEMBER OF THE NC DOUBLE A WERE REQUIRED. TO FOLLOW THE RULES. AND SHE WE KNOW OF ANY VIOLATIONS TO SELF REPORT THOSE RULES ARE SELF REPORT THOSE VIOLATIONS AND BEAR THE REPLICATIONS. MY EXPERIENCE IS THAT SHOULD A SCHOOL REPEATEDLY BREAK NC DOUBLE A RULES HARSH PENALTIES CAN FOLLOW IN EFFECT COMPETITION SCHOLARSHIPS AND MUCH OTHER. AN ADDITIONAL CONCERN A REAL WORLD CONCERN FOR ME IS THE NAME IMAGE AND LIKENESS. WHAT ARE THE PROTECTIONS HERE? WHAT STOP THIS DO NOT LEAVE FROM SIGNING A DEAL WITH MGM GRAND CASINO AND SPORTS BOOK? SPORTS GAMBLING IS A BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY AND NOW FOOTBALL PLAYERS ARE BASKETBALL PLAYERS MIGHT BE TEMPTED AND HAVE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST. WE'VE HAD A HISTORY IN NC DOUBLE A OF POINT SHAVING SCANDALS BEFORE NOW IS THIS AN ENDORSEMENT TO GO OUT THERE AND OPEN UP ANOTHER DOOR ANOTHER PANDORA'S BOX. THE SECOND IS CANNABIS. CANNABIS IS THE IS A BANNED SUBSTANCE THE NC DOUBLE A WHAT IF A STUDENT ATHLETE SIGNED AN ENDORSEMENT DEAL WITH. A DISPENSARY. WHAT IF PART OF THE -- INCENTIVE THERE IS A REQUIREMENT TO USE SAID. CANNABIS THAT'S IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE RULES. AGAIN THESE ARE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES WHERE ARE THE PROTECTIONS THAT. PREVENT THESE THINGS FROM HAPPENING. THAT'S WHY I URGE. A PAUSE THIS IS A GOOD CONVERSATION. IT'S THE MECHANISM THAT I ACTUALLY OPPOSE. IT'S IMPORTANT I'M GLAD THAT WE'RE ALL HERE TODAY HAVING AN OPEN CONVERSATION. AND I WOULD URGE THAT WE TAKE A FURTHER IN DEPTH LOOK THAT WE WE BRING IN MORE STUDENT ATHLETES TO BRING IN MORE COACHES WE BRING IN MORE STAFF AND ADMINISTRATION AND AND THE NC DOUBLE A DOES. BECOME MORE INVOLVED THAN I WOULD URGE SOME TIME TO ALLOW THE NC DOUBLE A WORKING GROUP TO COME BACK -- YOU KNOW THE GOAL IS TO COME BACK IN IN OCTOBER I BELIEVE. AND AGAIN I'M I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE RUSHES TO GET THERE. THESE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES ARE POTENTIALLY VERY REAL AND ONCE THAT DOORS OPEN IT'S VERY TOUGH TO GO BACK. THE OLD ADAGE YOU KNOW OF A WOOD WORKER YOU MEASURE TWICE AND CUT ONCE. LET'S NOT DO THE OPPOSITE. THANK YOU FOR THE TIME THANK YOU. OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU RUN A GIVE YOU LEVELS WITH STANFORD UNIVERSITY IN OPPOSITION. ENJOY WATCHING THIS CALIFORNIA UNIVERSE IN OPPOSITION. ALEX GRAYS THE ASSOCIATION INDEPENDENT CALIFORNIA COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES IN OPPOSITION. KATHLEEN SORRY I NOBODY UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN OPPOSITION. ANY ANY TWEETERS. WRYNECK LANEY WITH CEOS OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION WE'D LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHOR AND THE CHAIRMAN FOR RECOGNIZING THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OUR INSTITUTIONS IN HIGH PROFILE NC DOUBLE A PROGRAMS. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO PARTICIPATING IN ANY DISCUSSIONS -- GOING FORWARD ON HOW BEST TO SUPPORT OUR STUDENT ATHLETES. THANK YOU. JUSTIN SELLER COMBAT FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES CHANCES OFFICE WE DON'T HAVE A A POSITION ON THE BILL. WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE INTENT BUT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS ARE A BIT CONCERNING JUST BECAUSE THE CHANCES OFFICE HAS NOT. TRADITIONALLY HAD A ROLE IN ATHLETICS SO THERE MAY BE SOME ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AT OUR AGENCY MAY NEED TO COMPLETE THE WORK GROUP REQUIREMENTS. THE THANK YOU. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. YES MISTER PATTERSON. ALRIGHT I I GOT ASKING TOUGH QUESTIONS -- I I'M CONFLICTED HERE -- AND I WANT. TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION SPECIFICALLY WITH RESPECT RESPECT TO FRESNO STATE UNIVERSITY I ALMA. ALARM I REPRESENT THE UNIVERSITY IT. FEELS LIKE WE'RE PLAYING A GAME OF CHICKEN WITH THE NC TWO WAY AND ESTABLISHING THIS RULE. THAT PUTS THE STATE OUTSIDE OF THE AND SEE TO IT I I I I I UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT WE ALSO HAVE AN NC TO A SERIOUS INQUIRY INTO THIS. SO PART OF ME SAYS I THINK WE MADE OUR POINT. WHAT I WANT TO ASK IS THE IMPLEMENTATION? WHEN DOES THIS BECOME -- ACTUALIZED. AND IF THERE SHOULD BE -- REPORT FROM THE NC TO WEIGH THAT IN SOME WAYS MY MIRRORS. BUT MAYBE DOESN'T DO EVERYTHING THE BILL DOES. AS THE AUTHORS WOULD WOULD WOULD YOU BE. COMMITTING TO STEPPING BACK. LOOKING AT IT [inaudible] BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION. AND IF A NATIONAL -- NC TO A DECISION. WAS CLOSE ENOUGH. COULD COULD YOU AND WOULD YOU LIVE WITH THAT. THROUGH THE YEAR GET ON SO THE BILL IS DESIGNED. DO NOT TAKE AFFECT. UNTIL. TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND THE PURPOSE OF THAT. IS FOR THE NC TWO WAY. IF THEY CHOOSE. TO RESPOND TO GIVE THEM THAT TIME IT ALSO IF YOU READ THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL IT STATES EXPLICITLY. THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD REVISIT. IF THE NC TWO EIGHT SUBSTANTIALLY CHANGES THE RULES. NOW THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO IN FRAMING THIS IS. IT'S IRONIC TO ME THAT WE HAVE OUR COLLEGES HERE IN OPPOSITION. BECAUSE THE NC TWO EIGHT IS AN ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES. THESE ARE COLLEGES OPPOSING COLLEGES. OUR OWN COLLEGES. HAVE THE ABILITY. TO WORK WITH THE NC TWO WAY TO CHANGE THE RULES. AND IN FACT THE NC TO A HAS A HISTORY. OF FITS AND STARTS IN ALL ASPECTS OF IN OUR ACTUALLY WE AS I INDICATED I HAVE TECHNICAL WITNESS HERE AND I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE HIM. PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION AND ALSO THE LEGAL RESPONSE TO THE ISSUE OF WHETHER THE NC TWO EIGHT COULD. PREVENT CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS FROM PARTICIPATING FOR EXAMPLE AND CHAMPIONSHIPS WOULD THAT BE AMENABLE TO THE CHAIR. BRIEFLY IT. HE'S A LAWYER. I'M IT DID IT DID THIS IS MY PERIOD TO THE QUESTION YES I WOULD MUCH RATHER HEAR FROM THE AUTHOR SPECIFICALLY AND DIRECTLY. AND NOT AND NOT A LAWYER'S AYE AYE. QUESTION IS. IT IS VERY VERY YES EXPLICIT YES IF IF IF YOU IF THIS. BILL MOVES. BECAUSE THEY MOVED THE BALL. AND NC TO A DOZEN FACT COME BACK WITH SOMETHING. REASONABLY ACCEPTABLE PRIOR -- TO THE BILL BECOMING -- EFFECTIVE RIGHT SO IT'S NOT EASY YOU ARE ARE YOU COMMITTING. AS AUTHORS HERE AND NOW. THAT THAT SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD CAUSE YOU TO IN FACT REVISIT THE BILL. AND PRESENT WASTE WHERE WE ARE NOT IN CONFLICT IN CONFLICT. THE VERY. ABSOLUTELY IN THE VERY WARM. THE VERY WAY THE BILL IS WRITTEN MAKES THAT COMMITMENT. THE VERY WAY THE BILL AS WRITTEN IF YOU LOOK AT THE VERY LANGUAGE THAT WE'RE PUTTING INTO STATUTE IT MAKES THAT COMMITMENT. AND BUT THE REASON I FEEL THAT THE BILL IS STILL NECESSARY EVEN WITH THE THREE YEAR DELAY. IS THE ANC TO A COMMISSIONED THEIR OWN THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TASK FORCE THEY'VE HAD ON SUCH A SUBJECT. THEY ASKED CONDOLEEZZA RICE WHICH YOU KNOW HAS AN AFFILIATION WITH THE NFL TO SET UP A COMMISSION. TO LOOK EXACTLY AT THESE ISSUES IN RESPONSE TO THE VARIOUS LAWSUITS THAT THEY HAD EXPERIENCED THE O'BANNON LAWSUIT VARIOUS OTHERS. AND THEY SET UP THE CONDOLEEZZA RICE COMMISSION. THAT COMMISSION. RECOMMENDED THAT IN SITU A CHANGE THE RULES IN RECOMMENDED THAT STUDENTS HAVE THE RIGHT TO THEIR OWN IMAGE AND LIKENESS THE NC TWO EIGHT JUST DIDN'T EVEN WRITE REFERENCE BACK THEY NEVER SAID WELL. WE ACCEPT THESE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR KNOCKING ACT THE JUST. THEY NEVER RESPONDED THAT WAS ONLY LAST OCTOBER OR A YEAR AGO SO. SO AND I COULD CITE MANY ADDITIONAL INCIDENTS WHERE NC. TO EIGHT CHANGE THE RULES A LITTLE OR JUST IGNORED EVEN. TASK FORCES AND COMMISSIONS THAT THEY THEMSELVES SET UP. AND WE WANT TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE THE UNFAIRNESS OF THIS. TENNIS PLAYERS FOR EXAMPLE IN THE UNDER THE NC TWO EIGHT ARE ALLOWED TO TAKE HOME A TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR PURSE EACH YEAR NO OTHER. ATHLETE IS. EVEN THOUGH YOU MIGHT HAVE A WRESTLER FOR IT THANK. OR ANY OTHER STUDENT ATHLETES WHO MIGHT HAVE A SIMILAR ABILITY -- TO PARTICIPATE IN A TOURNAMENT THAT GIVES A CASH AWARD BUT ONLY. THE TENNIS PLAYERS. D. BASKETBALL PLAYERS RECENTLY MEN BASKETBALL PLAYERS THE NC TO A IS NOW ALLOWING TO HAVE AN AGENT. ONLY MEANT WHAT HAPPENED A TITLE. NINE SO WE SEE THE NC TWO WAY WHEN THEY GET UNDER PRESSURE MAKE A LITTLE CHANGE. LET'S SEE IF THEY'RE SERIOUS IN THERE WILL MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE. BUT FINALLY THE THREAT REGARDING. THAT WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PLAY IN CHAMPIONSHIPS. THE I WILL SPEAK FOR MY TECHNICAL EXPERT BUT MIGHT THE TECHNICAL EXPERT THAT I HAVE THAT THE TABLE. IS -- APOLOGIES FOR MY PAPER SIR FLOATING. OCT SKEWS ME MARC ALMOND WHO IS IN NEW YORK LAW PROFESSOR AND THE AUTHOR OF THE FORBES ARTICLE WHY THE NC TO A LIKELY CANNOT KEEP CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS. FOR ME THEIR CHAMPIONSHIPS OR FROM GIVING THIS RIGHT BECAUSE IT WOULD BE AN ANTI TRUST VIOLATION. AND THIS IS WHY NOW YOU SEE THE NC TO A HAS NOT THREATENED TO ELIMINATE CALIFORNIA COLLEGES FROM ANY PARTICIPATION ONLY FROM CHAMPIONSHIPS BECAUSE IT'S THAT IF YOU'RE A COLLEGE ATHLETE. TO THINK THAT YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PLACE CHAMPIONSHIPS IS QUITE IT YOU KNOW THAT. THERE REALLY WOULD BE WORRISOME TO A STUDENT BUT THEY MADE THAT SORT OF MOST POTENT THREAT. BUT THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE THE LEGAL ABILITY TO DO SO BECAUSE IT WOULD BE AN ANTITRUST VIOLATION AND I WOULD REFER YOU TO THAT ARTICLE INTO A NUMBER OF OTHER ARTICLES NOW THAT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY LIKE TO ASK THE REPRESENT A FOR THE C.. CSU -- WHAT WHAT'S WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL? IF WE HAVE A BILL THAT IS NOT GOING TO GO INTO EFFECT. FOR THREE YEARS [inaudible] AND WE CURRENTLY HAVE A PROCESS BY THE NC TWO WAY. TO TAKE A A A A GOOD AND SERIOUS. LOOK AT THIS OP I'M FINDING IT DIFFICULT TO BE SYMPATHETIC. ARE OVER -- SORT OF THIS DOOMSDAY. CLAIM HERE BUT IT IS OF CONCERN TO ME IF. IT TURNS OUT TO BE REAL. SO IT IT IN AND CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG IT SEEMS. THAT NOTHING WILL HAPPEN OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD OF TIME EXCEPT WE WILL BE ABLE TO SEE. HOW SERIOUS THE NC TO A IS ABOUT [inaudible] FIXING THIS. YES I'M PLEASE. THERE IS AND IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF THE WEEDS IN MY NEW **** BUT IT'S ALREADY HAPPENING IT'S CALLED NEGATIVE RECRUITING SO WHAT COLLEGES ARE DOING -- AT THE COLLEGE LEVEL YOU RECRUITED THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL SO THAT THE CLASS OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE ARE ALREADY BEING CONTACTED. TO BE RECOVERABLE PROSPECTIVE STUDENT ATHLETES SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THOSE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO WOULD BE AFFECTED BY THIS RULE. AND THE NEGATIVE RECRUITING COMES FROM COACHES AND WE'VE ALREADY SEEN IT OR COACHES OUTSIDE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ARE USING IT AGAINST SCHOOLS LIKE LONG BEACH STATE. STANFORD AS THE GO DOWN THE LIST WHERE THEY SAY. WELL YOU YOU TO VERBALLY COMMIT TO US WHAT I'M NOT GONNA HAVE A SCHOLARSHIP IN YOU KNOW AND SEE IS NOT GOING TO ALLOW YOU AGAIN WITH TWO WORLDS. THERE'S NO WAY FOR EXAMPLE IF REGGIE BUSH RIGHT NOW IS BEING RECRUITED. TO PLAY FOOTBALL AT TEXAS OR USC. AND HE WENT TO TEXAS IN THE SHOW TO MOST OF THE GREAT GREAT GREAT. HE GOES AS SEE IT'S GOOD IT'S GOOD IT'S GREAT -- AND BY THE WAY WE CAN WE CAN GET YOU A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU KNOW ENDORSING TOYOTA. EVERY TIME REGGIE BUSH IS GONNA GO TO USC THOSE OUTSIDE SCHOOLS ARE NEVER GOING TO ALLOW IT THERE'S THIRTEEN HUNDREDS -- SCHOOLS THAT MAKE UP THE NC DOUBLE WAY CALIFORNIA IS THE DROP IN THE BUCKET IN TERMS OF THE MEMBERSHIP. SO TO TO TO SAY THAT CALIFORNIA IS OF THIS EIGHT HUNDRED POUND GORILLA THAT JUST GONNA BURY ITS WAY THROUGH AND PUSH PEOPLE AROUND -- THAT'S NOT THE CASE I I WILL I WISH IT WAS. YOU KNOW PERSONALLY I THINK IT IF THAT WERE THE CASE WHY DO WE KEEP ADDING MORE AND MORE STATES TO THE BAND TRAVEL LIST. AND WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT NOW WE WE CAN'T CONTRACT GAMES WITH CERTAIN STATES BECAUSE WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO TRAVEL THERE. SO IF WE WERE THESE LEADERS AND I WISH WE WERE I I WISH WE WERE I BELIEVE IN IT I BELIEVE. THAT THE STATES ARE PASSING DISCRIMINATORY LAWS. BUT IT DOES AFFECT WHAT WE DO HERE SO. THERE ARE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IN THIS THREE YEAR PERIOD WHERE YOU WILL SEE A FLIGHT OF TALENTS YOU COULD SEE COACHES LEAVE AM I GONNA HAVE A JOB I'VE GOT A FAMILY TO FEED WHAT IF NEVADA THERE'S A SYSTEM COACHING JOB IN. WELL I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GONNA HAVE A JOB IN [inaudible] TWENTY TWENTY THREE IS THAT. A CERTAIN THING NOW IT IT'S NOT BUT PEOPLE HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS AND YOUR FORCING REALLY YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN IN HIGH SCHOOL TO MAKE DECISIONS AND FAMILIES TO MAKE DECISIONS RIGHT NOW. WHY ARE WE FORCING THAT TO HAPPEN? I I MEAN LET'S JUST TAKE A PAUSE HERE LET'S LET'S SEE WHAT COMES BACK AND AT WERE READY TO TO TO TAKE FURTHER ACTION AND WE TAKE FURTHER ACTION BUT AGAIN. MEASURE TWICE CUT ONCE. MISTER AND APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE QUESTION I I MUST TELL YOU THAT I I AM SYMPATHETIC BUT I ALSO. ABOUT A PLACE HERE WHERE I I I NEED TO HAVE FURTHER CONVERSATIONS WITH RESIDENTS THAT UNIVERSITY OVER THIS THESE THESE THESE CONFLICTS OUR SERIOUS. TWO PEOPLE I KNOW WELL WHO ARE STUDENTS AND WHO ARE WHO MAY BE FACING THIS. SO I'M NOT I'M GONNA BE I'M NOT GOING TO BE CASTING A VOTE TODAY BUT I WANT TO RESERVE MY VOTE FOR THE FLOOR. AND WHEN IT GETS TO THE FLOOR WILL HAVE SOME DISCUSSIONS. UP PRIOR TO THAT WITH WITH RESIDENTS STATE. THAT TO REALLY DIG INTO THE REALITY OF WHETHER OR NOT FRESNO STATE IS EXPERIENCING THIS KIND OF RECRUITMENT FLIGHT AS A RESULT -- AND IT'S NOT JUST GOING TO BE WITH THE EXECUTIVES -- IT'S GOING TO BE WAS STUDENTS AND ATHLETES AND FAMILIES I KNOW VERY VERY WELL SO I I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT. I BUT I'M TROUBLED ABOUT WHAT I DON'T KNOW AND I'VE I'VE GOT THE FIRM THAT UP BEFORE I CAN CAST AND I MR LIVING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU -- TO THE AUTHORS FOR PRESENTING THIS BOMBING OF A FOR IT TODAY I THINK THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF ISSUES THAT STILL NEED TO BE WORKED OUT I I KNOW THAT YOU'VE GOT DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION -- HI HEAR AND UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION BUT THIS IS A IS. AN ISSUE THAT I REMEMBER PEOPLE ON MY CAMPUS TALKING TO ME ABOUT BACK WHEN I WAS A STUDENT BACK IN THE LAST MILLENNIUM. I GUESS I'M TRYING TO MAKE MYSELF SOUND TOO OLD BUT I MEAN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR A LONG TIME. AND AND CA IS GONNA MOVE AS SLOW AS IT WANTS TO MOVE. AND AND IN IN A WAY THAT IS. UNEQUAL AS YOU'VE ALREADY DEMONSTRATED IN IN THE EXAMPLES THAT YOU'VE GIVEN AND THINGS THAT THEY'VE ALREADY ALLOWED -- SO WHETHER THIS BILL ACTUALLY BECOMES LAW -- IS IS ALMOST SECONDARY TO TE FACT THAT WE NEED TO COAX THIS CONVERSATION FURTHER THAN IT'S EVER BEEN BEFORE IN YOUR BILL CERTAINLY IS A VEHICLE FOR THAT THANK YOU MR GABRIEL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- SO IT JUST SOME QUESTIONS FOR FOR THE OPPOSITION IN PARTICULAR FOR THE UC SYSTEM. I CAN UNDERSTAND THE THE CHALLENGES YOU FACE AN ARGUMENT ABOUT GETTING CAUGHT IN BETWEEN THE YOU KNOW PER PERSON REALLY CALIFORNIA STATE LAW AND NC DOUBLE A BY LAWS. THE QUESTION I HAVE IS WHAT'S THE WHAT'S UNIVERSITIES POSITION ON THE CAR ROLE. THE COROLLA OF WHAT THE CURRENT RULE I'M SORRY -- THE GUARD RULE TO NAY MAYBE TO LIKE THIS YEAH I KNOW SO I I I UNDERSTAND. THAT AGAIN WE KIND OF WENT AND TALKED ABOUT HOW WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO THE CONVERSATION THAT WE'RE HAVING TODAY I THINK IT'S ONE THAT NEEDS TO BE HAPPENED I THINK THE BILL. CERTAINLY SERVE THAT PURPOSE I CAN'T SAYING GO ON A LIMB AND SAY WHAT THE UNIVERSE MUSICIAN BECAUSE I MOSTLY CHANNELING. THE CONCERNS FROM ALL THE DIFFERENT ATHLETIC DIRECTOR SMALL THE CAMPUSES SO I CAN'T GO ON A LIMB AND SAY THAT BUT I DO THINK. THERE IS INTEREST IN THIS ISSUE AND I THINK -- YOU KNOW WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT IT MORE THAT'S KIND OF WHY MY TEST MY SUGGESTS THAT WE WAIT TO SEE I GET THAT IT'S AN UNSTABLE A WORKING GROUP BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. A WORKING GROUP THAT'S GOING TO HAVE YOU KNOW PRESIDENT OF THE BIGGEST UNIVERSITIES EIGHTIES FROM THE SMALLEST UNIVERSITIES DO NAPPIES FROM THE THREE AND D. TO ANTI. ONE AND THEN WE CAN LOOK AT IT AS A STATE AND SAY WHAT DOES THIS SAY WHAT IT WHAT DOES IT MEAN YOU KNOW WE DON'T KNOW WE DON'T KNOW AND THAT'S THAT'S PART OF OUR FEARS THAT. WE JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE AND WHAT THE POTENTIAL. YOU KNOW FABRICA POLICE ATHLETIC TO LOOK LIKE PASSED TWENTY TWENTY THREE WHATEVER THE BILL GETS INTO IMPLEMENTATION SO. I HOPE THAT AS YOUR QUESTION BUT I THINK THE CONCERN AGAIN IS THAT WERE KIND OF BEEN STUCK IN THE MIDDLE THIS WHOLE PROCESS AND WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY -- TO YOU KNOW MOVE FOR IN A PRODUCTIVE MANNER BUT IT JUST JUST HASN'T HAPPENED YET. THANK YOU FOR THAT I I WILL SAY AS A AS A AS A PROUD CAL LAMANNA IN A BIG CAL FOOTBALL FAN AND AND SOMEONE WHO CARES A LOT ABOUT. THE CSU SYSTEM IS PROUD TO PRESENT REPRESENTS THE SUN -- YOU KNOW I WISH THAT THE THE THE CSU AND YOU SEE WOULD BE MORE. OUT FRONT ON THIS ISSUE I THINK THAT THE SYSTEM THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS IS DEEPLY EXPLICATE F. AND I THINK IT WOULD WRECK REFLECT REALLY REALLY WELL. ON BOTH OF THOSE SYSTEMS AS MEMBER INSTITUTIONS OF THE NC DOUBLE A TO SAY LISTEN WE THINK THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM WE HAVE ISN'T FAIR AND TREATS ATHLETES ON FAIRLY AND THAT WE WANT TO BE PART OF MAKING POSITIVE CHANGE SO. I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT THERE ARE AS AS THE WITNESS FROM LONG BEACH THEY POINT OUT SOME POTENTIAL DOWNSIDES TO THIS THERE CERTAINLY A LOT THAT WE DON'T KNOW I UNDERSTAND THOSE CONFLICTS BUT I HAVE TO WEIGH. THOSE POTENTIAL DOWNSIDES WHICH ARE UNKNOWN POTENTIAL CONFLICTS IN THE FUTURE WITH THE DOWNSIDE TO THE CURRENT SYSTEM AND THE CURRENT SYSTEM AS I SAID I THINK IS DEEPLY EXPLICATED -- IT'S PARTICULAR EXPLOITATIVE OF PEOPLE OF COLOR AND I THINK IT'S VERY APPROPRIATE FOR CALIFORNIA TO WEIGH IN HERE TO WEIGH IN WITH OUR VALUES TO TRY PUSHING CHANGE I COMMEND THE AUTHORS FOR THE SYSTEM THAT THEY'VE SET UP THEY'VE DELAYED THE IMPLEMENTATION. FOR A LONG TIME SO WE CAN SEE THEY REALLY GIVEN THE NC DOUBLE A TIME TO WORK THIS OUT WE HAVE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES TO SEE THAT. OUR PROCESS COME TO FRUITION IF IT IF THE IF THE NC DOUBLE A DOES THE RIGHT THING -- THEN WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE CALIFORNIA LAW TO CONFORM WITHOUT TO RECOGNIZE THAT BUT IT APPROPRIATELY PLACES A TIME LINE ON THAT AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY KNOW THE CALIFORNIA'S GOING. TO IS GOING TO LEAD WITH ITS VALUES AND SO I WOULD REALLY -- AS SOMEBODY WHO CARES A LOT ABOUT. THESE PUBLIC UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS WHO CARES A LOT ABOUT ATHLETICS AT THOSE SYSTEM -- I REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO HAVE A A FREE CONVERSATION WITH YOUR MEMBERS AND TO SAY LISTEN WE WE FEEL THAT IT'S IMPORTANT. AS INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE COMMITTED TO THE PUBLIC GOOD THAT REFLECT THE VALUES THE PEOPLE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAD A LEAD ON THESE ISSUES AND SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO THAT -- COMMEND THE AUTHORS FOR THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE LOOK FOR TO VOTING FOR TODAY THANK YOU. MISTER KILEY. A GOOD AFTERNOON THAT CAN I JUST GET OUT A LITTLE BETTER SENSE OF WHAT KIND OF ENDORSEMENTS YOU THINK WILL BE -- DEALING WITH I MEAN I YOU MENTIONED -- SENATOR SKINNER AYE YOU KNOW YOU COULD HAVE LOCAL ALREADY CAUGHT ROTARY CLUBS THEY'RE PROVIDING SUPPORT BUT IMAGINE THAT'LL BE PRETTY SMALL SLICE OF THE OVERALL. REVENUES OR WE'D YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA BE VIDEO GAMES CHIU DEALS ATHLETES STARRING KOMMER WHO ARE KIND OF THE BIG POTS OF REVENUE THAT YOU THINK WATCHING MATERIALIZE -- THANK YOU SO MEMBER KILEY -- THE THERE'S ONLY JUST AS WE SEE ONLY A HANDFUL OF ATHLETES ACTUALLY GET TO GO PRO THERE'S ONLY A HANDFUL OF ATHLETES THAT WILL GET. SIGNIFICANT MONEY FROM AN ENDORSEMENT DEAL OR YOU KNOW WHAT CHIU OR OF VIDEO GAME. IN FACT THE VAST MAJORITY OF ATHLETES AND THEY COULD BE OF ANY ANY TYPE OF ANY SPORT. WHAT THIS REALLY JUST GIVES THEM THE ABILITY DO IS MARKET THEMSELVES? SO RIGHT NOW WE SEE COLLEGE STUDENTS AND WE SEE RICHEST EVERYBODY EVERYBODY HAS THE ABILITY TO USE SOCIAL MEDIA WHETHER IT'S YOU TUBE INSTAGRAM HOWEVER. TO THEY CAN MONETIZE SO YOU HAD -- A GENTLEMAN AT CAL MY SAID LIKE ASSEMBLYMEMBER GABRIEL I'M A BEAR -- WILLIAM HAN. WAS APOLOGIES MISTER HAN IF YOU HEAR THIS BUT HE WAS WITHOUT TALENT OKAY HE WAS HE LIKE TO SING. AND HE WOULD STAND ON SPRAWL AND SEEING TERRIBLY BUT YOU TO THEMSELF AND MADE. LIKE A LOT OF MONEY HE MONETIZED HIS YOU TUBE THERE WAS NOTHING THAT PREVENTED HIM FROM DOING SO NOW IF I TAKE. CAITLYN -- HASHI THE INCREDIBLE GYMNAST AT UCLA SHE HAS SEVENTY TWO MILLION YOUTUBE VIEWERS SEVENTY TWO MILLION. SHE COULD MONETIZE THAT. SHE'S NOT ALLOWED. TO WILL SHE HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE PAID PROFESSIONALLY. PRETTY DOUBTFUL MAYBE NOT MUCH -- ANYWAY THAT TIME IN COLLEGE MAY HAVE BEEN THE REAL TIME THAT SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE. TO RECOVER ANY TYPE OF COMPENSATION FOR THE INCREDIBLE TALENT SHE HAD. SO THE NAME IMAGE AND LIKENESS IS NOT RESTRICTED JUST TO AN EXTERNAL ENTITY GIVING YOU A ENDORSEMENT IT COULD BE JUST YOU MARKETING. T. SHIRTS OF YOURSELF HATS. YEAH IF WITH YOUR PERMISSION CLASS FROM THE THIS THE FORMER OF ALL UP WHERE FOR STANFORD SHE STILL HERE I SORRY TO MAKE YOU HAVE TO COME BACK OUT BUT YOU HAD MENTIONED YOU HAD ENDORSEMENT DEALS THAT WHAT KIND OF THAT. IMPORTANT TO YOU OFFER. YOU MAY. I'M SO YEAH I MEAN WE'RE IT SUMMED FOR SOME PEOPLE IT COULD BE REALLY AND BIG ENDORSEMENTS BUT ON ON MY END I WAS TRAINING WITH THE U. S. NATIONAL TEAM DURING HIGH SCHOOL AND HAD LIKE I COULD HAVE BEEN MAKING A WEEKLY STIPEND. AND DID NOT TAKE IT BECAUSE I WAS NOT ONLY BE AND SO I WAS NOT PROTECTED BY THOSE RULES AND I WAS TRYING TO REMAIN ELIGIBLE FOR MY AND SEE A CAREER THAT I WAS NOT YET. EVEN -- PARTICIPATING IN AND SO THE NCAA RULES READ BACK ALL THE WAY TO HIGH SCHOOLERS AND I PLAYED BEACH VOLLEYBALL AS WELL SO I WAS TALKING WITH TWO SPORT ATHLETE I AM IN THE NCAA AND DURING MY TIME IN HIGH SCHOOL -- I WAS APPROACHED FOR YOU KNOW SMALL SUNGLASSES DEALS BUT GOOD SUNGLASSES THAT PROTECT YOUR EYES ARE LIKE TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS AND A PAIR FREE SUNGLASSES WOULD HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE YOU KNOW AND AND THEN THERE WAS ALSO A TV SHOW THAT THEY WANTED TO DO. WAS LIKE SOME STRANGE MTV REALITY SHOW -- AND I DIDN'T WANT TO GET INTO MUDDY WATERS WITHOUT HAVING REPRESENTATION BUT AT THAT AGE YOU'RE TONIGHT AN AGENT -- AND SO REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT I WOULD HAVE DONE THE TV SHOW THE POINT WAS I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A RIGHT TO AN AGENT -- AND SO. FOR SOME PEOPLE THIS COULD BE AS SIMPLE AS GETTING A FREE MEAL EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE FROM A WELL MEANING FAN -- AND FOR OTHERS IT COULD MEAN A LOT MORE -- BUT IT'S REALLY JUST THE RIGHT TO HAVING THE ABILITY TO MARKET YOURSELF I KNOW IT'S PRETTY COMMON FOR OTHER VITAL PLAYERS OF YOUR CALIBER TO RECEIVE SIMILAR OFFERS. YOUR PARENTS I WOULD SAY SO WOMEN'S LEVELS IMMENSELY POPULAR AND I REALLY THINK THAT WERE BEING DENIED A MARKET AT THE END CA LEVEL -- YOU HAVE GIRLS THAT WE ARE WE AT LEAST MY FRESHMAN YEAR I KNOW THAT WE BROKE EVEN IN THE ATHLETIC DEPARTMENT PLEASE THAT'S WHAT I WAS TOLD LIKE WE WERE NOT. WE WERE BRING IN ENOUGH REVENUE FOR THE SCHOOL THAT WE WERE NOT LOSING MONEY FOR THE SCHOOL AND THAT I I THINK. COULD WE COULD BE MAKING EVEN MORE MONEY BOTH FOR THE UNIVERSITIES AND FOR OURSELVES IF WE WERE GIVEN THE CHANCE TO MARKET OURSELVES. ESPECIALLY IN THE AGE OF SOCIAL MEDIA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- DID YOU WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT I JUST WANT TO MENTION. THERE IS THE CONCEPT AGAIN OF AMATEURISM. AND PROFESSIONALISM THERE ARE OPTIONS ONE EXAMPLE WOULD BE TIGER WOODS. HE DECIDED TO GO TO STANFORD HE FOR AGO HE FOR EAGLE ABOUT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BECAUSE HE DECIDED THAT HE WANTED GO TO COLLEGE. HE WANTED TO BE AN AMATEUR. HE DID HAVE THE OPTION TO TURN PRO AND MAKE MONEY. AND TODAY WITH DISTANCE LEARNING YOU CAN STILL GO TO SCHOOL THERE'S VERY OPTIONS WE SEE MANY STUDENT ATHLETES TO EXASCALE TO BE FINISHED UP THE CAREER TAKING. ONLINE COURSEWORK SO YOU KNOW I WENT THROUGH THE LIST OF ALL OF OUR SPORTS. AND IF MONEY WAS THE ISSUE. YOU'RE NOT PROHIBITED FROM MAKING MONEY YOU CAN GO ON THE LPGA. THE PGA. THERE'S WATER POLO VOLLEYBALL THERE'S A V. P. THE I MEAN YOU GO DOWN THE LIST SO IF YOU WANT TO MONETIZE YOURSELF IF YOU'RE GOOD ENOUGH. YOU CAN GO MAKE MONEY THERE THERE'S NOT A RESTRICTION ON MAKING MONEY IN AMERICA AND BEING AN ATHLETE. BUT THERE IS A RESTRICTION NOW IN TERMS OF THE NC DOUBLE A RULES AND THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AMATEURISM AND BEING A PROFESSIONAL. THANK YOU AND JUST ONE MORE QUESTION LET ME GO AHEAD OF YOU -- DID YOU THINK THERE'S ANY ARRESTS THAT -- THIS MIGHT -- ADVANTAGED SCHOOLS AND LARGE MEDIA MARKETS WHERE -- YOU KNOW THEY'LL BE A GREATER ABILITY TO MONETIZE -- YOUR LIKENESS SO THAT YOU KNOW MAYBE IF YOU'RE A SCHOOL IN LA YOU'D BE A ADVANTAGE OVER SCHOOL FROM A SMALLER MARKET. I I I MORE THAN LIKELY BUT I I DON'T AGAIN I DON'T THINK IT'S ABOUT -- WHAT MARKET IT'S THE VALUE THAT? I INDIVIDUAL OR COMPANY OR LOCAL BUSINESSES FIND AND THAT ATHLETES LIKE YOU SAY COULD BE A HOME TOWN KID THAT GREW UP IN. BY CELAYA AND THE LOCAL CAR DEALERSHIPS HAVE LET THIS KID I WANT TO PUT ITS POSTER MY ONE BILL AND I WANNA PANEL FOR THAT I WANT I WANT TO USE HIS IMAGE HOPEFULLY HE'LL SELL PARTS OF OUR OUR OUR FROM OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY I MEAN. WE'RE SAYING TAKE ADVANTAGE OF REGARD TO WHAT MARKET YOUR HEAD AND WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT AND MAKE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THIS IS NOT ABOUT MAKING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WOULD NOT WE I MEAN VERY FEW ATHLETES WILL FALL INTO THAT CATEGORY AND THOSE WHO DO. USUALLY LEAVE SCHOOL EARLY AGAIN AS I ON WILLIAMSON'S OF THE WORLD BUT THE MAJORITY OF I'M GONNA STAY FOR FOUR YEARS AND WHILE THEY'RE THERE PLAYING PLAYING. BASKETBALL LIKE ED O'BANNON GET FOR FOUR YEARS YOU WOULD HOPE THAT. ONCE YOU TURN ON A VIDEO GAME YOU FIND YOUR LIKENESS ON THE VIDEO GAME YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM IT AND THAT'S ALL WE'RE SAYING IF YOU'RE GONNA USE SOMEONE'S. NAME IMAGE AND LIKENESS LET THAT APTLY CONTROL THAT. THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER. THANK YOU I WANT TO THANK -- THE COLLEAGUES WHO COME IN AND OBVIOUSLY FRAME THIS MESSAGE FOR US -- YOU KNOW I'M I WAS READING. IN ONE OF THE ARTICLES -- THAT IF WE PASS THIS BILL THAT OUR STUDENTS WOULD BE BANNED FROM PLAYING IN ANY KIND OF TOURNAMENT BY IN SITU A IS THAT CORRECT. ARE YOU WOULD TRY TO DO THAT. I MAY YES PLEASE POTENTIALLY THE THREATS THERE POTENTIALLY YES IS IT A GUARANTEED NO BUT POTENTIALLY YES I HOPE NOT YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA THAT LIKE RENTS SO THAT MAKES THIS A VERY UNIQUE STATEMENT SENSE. BY IT ALL OUT YES PLEASE ONLY. GIVEN THAT THE OPPOSITION WAS ABLE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION CAN THAT. OVER TECHNICAL EXPERTS. DOCTOR WEBER YES PLEASE OKAY. HI THANK YOU I'M MARC EDELMAN I AM A PROFESSOR OF LAW WITH TENURE AT THE CITY UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK IS A CLEAN SCHOOL OF BUSINESS. I'VE ALSO BEEN ON FACULTY FOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS AS AN ADJUNCT AT FORDHAM LAW SCHOOL. AND THE FORBES PIECE THAT I WROTE I WAS A MICROCOSM OF OVER TWENTY LAW REVIEW ARTICLES I'VE WRITTEN AND PUBLISHED ON ANTI TRUST AND THE NC DOUBLE I MY POSITION AS WELL THE NC DOUBLE A HAS INDEED. MADE THE THREAT THE BAND SCHOOLS THAT ALLOW ATHLETES TO SIGN DOOR SMITH DEALS. ARE MUCH AS IT'S CORRECT. THAT A COLLEGE AT THE FALL THE NC DOUBLE A IS RULES THE NC DOUBLE A ALSO HAVE TO FOLLOW THE LAW OF THE LAND AND THAT INCLUDES SECTION ONE OF THE SHERMAN ACT. WHICH IS ANTI TRUST LAW. THE NC DOUBLE A IS MADE UP OF MORE THAN TWELVE HUNDRED MEMBER SCHOOLS WHICH GIVES THEM A MONOPOLY OVER COLLEGE ATHLETICS. WHEN THESE TWELVE HUNDRED MEMBER SCHOOLS COME TOGETHER AND PASS A RULE THAT SAYS NO MEMBER SCHOOL MAY COMPENSATE OR ALLOW ANY ATHLETE THE COULD MAKE MONEY? ON THEIR OWN NAME AND LIKENESS THAT WOULD AMOUNT TO WHAT'S CONSIDERED BOTH WAGE FIXING AND A GROUP BOYCOTT ALTERNATIVELY KNOWN AS A CONCERTED REFUSAL TO DEAL. BOTH WOULD BE PROBLEMATIC UNDER SECTION ONE OF THE SHERMAN ACT. TWO RECENT CASES THE JENKINS CASE IN THE BANNING CASE PAUL FROM THE NINTH CIRCUIT. AS WELL AS THE SUPREME COURT DECISION IN NC DOUBLE A VERSE BOARD OF REGENTS. HOLD AT THE NC DOUBLE A IS INDEED SUBJECT TO ANTITRUST LAW. AND IT'S MY OPINION THAT FAR MORE LIKELY THAN NOT IF THEY ENACTED THIS RESTRAINT IT WOULD DEEM TO BE ILLEGAL UNDER OUR ANTI TRUST LAWS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MR OF CONTORT MY SENATOR HERE FROM FROM LOS ANGELES OF YOU ARE YOU SAY THIS IS NOT REALLY AN ISSUE OF MAKING MILLIONS. BUT IT REALLY IS IT'S JUST WHO'S GETTING -- MILLION WALLS BILLION FOR THEM. THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT THIS IS A BIG BIG MONEY. AND WE SEEM RULES THAT HAVE CHANGED IN ORDER TO GET BIG MONEY. I MEAN THE FACT THAT WE ARE A DEMANDING THAT DOGS STUDENTS CAN'T PLAY STRAIGHT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL IN CERTAIN SPORTS PARTICULARLY. OF IS ONCE AGAIN NOT ABOUT THE NEED OF THE STUDENTS REALLY ABOUT THE NEED OF THE SPORT IN ORDER TO KEEP THESE FOLKS THESE CAMPUSES COMPETITIVE I GATHER. THAT'S THERE AND YOU KNOW HAVING BEEN THE PROFESSOR OF KAWHI LEONARD AND KNOWING THAT HE'S YEAR THAT HE SPENT IT'S AN EAGLE STATE THAT. BECAME TWO YEARS WAS NOT SOMETHING HE WOULD HAVE EVER WANTED TO DO -- AND THE SAME IS TRUE WITH DIANA AND SO AS I LOOK AT THIS AND I'M THINKING IS THIS IS THE BEST INTEREST OF STUDENTS KNOWS IN INVEST INTEREST OF UNIVERSITY IN MAKING MONEY YES. IT IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF ACADEMICS NO -- BECAUSE THOSE OF THAT'S NOT THE FOCUS OF A IT'S A REALLY ABOUT MAKING LOTS OF MONEY AND THE AND AS I LISTEN TO THESE RULES. A PARTICULARLY THE THE THE THE THE ISSUES OF WHAT YOU CAN'T DO BEGINNING IN HIGH SCHOOL AND I'VE HAD SOME STUDENTS WHO WERE. SOMEHOW ANOTHER VIçT SOMETHING IN HIGH SCHOOL BECAME VERY BIG BECAUSE THEY ACCEPTED SOMETHING THAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT YET. THEY'RE BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO THESE RULES IS IF YOU OWN THESE PEOPLE. AND OBVIOUSLY BEING AFRICAN AMERICAN OWNING PEOPLE IS NOT SOMETHING I'M REALLY -- IN FAVOR OF HAVING US SURVIVED A BITE ANSWERS TO SLAVERY IF THIS I'VE ALWAYS FELT. THIS WHOLE GAME THINGS LIKE BIG SLAVE SYSTEM. THAT OF THAT ROUTE DOESN'T ALLOW YOU TO ACTUALIZE PLAY THE SPORT. OF THE VERY SPORTS AND HE GOT VERY LITTLE OUT OF IT. MOST OF MY STUDENTS ALMOST LIVE IN POVERTY WHILE THEY WERE ON CAMPUS AS IT WERE COULDN'T EVEN GET SOMEONE COULD GET FINANCIAL AID THAT DIDN'T GET ADEQUATE SCHOLARSHIP. THEY COULD WORK IN THE SUMMER THEY COULD WORK IN THE EVENINGS THAT YOU KNOW AND THEY THEY JUST USED EVERY MOMENT OF THEM. IN ORDER -- TO PLAY THE SPORT AND YET THEY WOULD NOT ABLE TO MARKET THEMSELVES IN ANY KIND OF MANNER IN ANY FASHION. AND AND MANY OF THEM WERE NOT GOING PRO SO THIS WAS A A TIME IN THEIR LIFE WHEN THEY COULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING AND THEN TO SEE. IN THE END THAT OUR UNIVERSITIES WERE MAKING MORE AND MORE AND MORE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE FOCUS IS IS IS GETTING ON TV AND DRIVING EVERYTHING ELSE AND MAKING. MORE MONEY AND MORE MONEY AND AND I MOST FACULTY ON CAMPUS EVERY YEAR THERE WAS ALWAYS A PROTEST OR EIGHT EFFORT TO ELIMINATE SPORTS AT SAN DIEGO STATE -- BECAUSE OF THE TREMENDOUS MONEY THAT WAS COMING INTO THE CAMPUS IS THAT WOULD NOT BENEFITING STUDENTS. OF THE HUGE SALARIES OF FACULTY BEPPO THAT NOT FACULTY BUT CULTURES WERE MAKING FAR ABOVE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO THE CULTURES WHO RAN THE VERY SPORTS AND IT'S JUST A HUGE MACHINE OF ITSELF. AND IN THE END WHEN I LOOK AT IT MOST OF MY STUDENTS AND BENEFIT FROM IT. I PROBABLY HAD TO STUDENTS IN ALL THE TIME HAVE BEEN IN WHO REALLY BEEN REALLY SEARS PRO. YOU KNOW AND YOU KNOW FOOTBALL OF THE FOOTBALL PLAYER I MEAN BASKETBALL C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; ISLAND IT OF&lt;/c&gt;</u> COURSE. AND BLOCKING ON POINTED TOE AND TONY GWYNN BASEBALL -- BEYOND THAT THAT'S A FORTY YEAR HISTORY OKAY THEN. IF YOU WANTED -- TO SOMEWHERE BUT YEAH BUT NOT REALLY SERIOUS MONEY I MEAN YOU KNOW LIKE THOSE TO THE ITSELF. SO WHEN I BEGIN TO ASK MYSELF THIS QUESTION AND WHEN IT WAS BROUGHT TO ME I I SAID TO MYSELF YOU KNOW WHO'S MAKING THE MONEY ON THIS AND WE SEE IT EVERY DAY -- WE SEE IT IN SMALL WAYS AND IN LARGE WAYS THIS CAMPUS CALCULATE HOW MUCH THEY CAN MAKE ON THE STUDENTS. AND KNOWING THAT THE STUDENTS WILL BENEFIT VERY LITTLE WHILE THE BEER WHAT THE WHAT THE PROMISE ALWAYS IF THEY WILL GO PRO. AND AND MANY OF THEM BELIEVE THAT KNOWING THAT THEY DON'T HAVE REALLY THE ABILITY IN A COMPETITIVE LEVEL TO ACTUALLY GO PRO -- I'VE SEEN SOME OF THE WORST THINGS IN TERMS OF THAT HAPPENED IN ATHLETICS I REALLY HAVE AS A PROFESSOR. OF ABUSE OF STUDENTS IN WAYS THAT ONE COULD NOT IMAGINE AND EVENTUALLY YOU COUPLE COACHES WHO GOT -- KICKED OUT AND STUDENT WHAT HAVE YOU BUT IN SEE TO A COVER UP A LOT OF STUFF. AND SO I JUST FIND IT APPALLING WHEN I READ AND SAID THAT THEY WILL BE THE EFFORT WOULD BE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STUDENTS. A DID NOT PARTICIPATE ANYTHING ELSE -- AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT THEIR LIVES BASED ON WHAT SCHOOL ARE GOING TO GO TO IN WHO'S GOING TO BE THE AND WHO'S NOT GOING TO BE THERE AND WHAT MONEY IS GOING TO BE THE AND ALL THAT OTHER KIND OF STUFF BUT IT REALLY. IS ABOUT THE PROTECTION AND SEE TO IT AND PROTECTION OF CAMPUSES AND THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE A LOTS AND LOTS OF MONEY ON THE STUDENTS. AND THE AND THE STUDENTS TO BENEFIT MOST OF THEM VERY LITTLE FROM BEING COLLEGE ATHLETES YOU KNOW MOST ATHLETES I KNOW NOW DID NOT MAKE ANY MONEY AS A RESULT OF BEING AN ATHLETE THAT HAVE BENEFITTED VERY LITTLE. IN THE PROCESS -- AND COULD THEY HAVE DONE SOMEONE ELSE MAKES A LITTLE BIT MORE MONEY MAYBE THEY COULD HAVE. BUT THE BUT THE RESTRICTION IS SAYS YOU CAN'T DO IT. IS WHAT I FIND TO BE HONEST MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE THE INABILITY TO USE MY TALENT MY SKILL TO MARKET MYSELF FOR MYSELF. A WHILE OTHER TO DOING THAT IS IS TO ME STILL AN UNACCEPTABLE AND UP SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL AND HOPEFULLY IN THE TIME FRAME. INTO TO A WILL SOMETIMES LOOK AT ITSELF THIS CONVERSATION IS I WOULD SAY PROBABLY OLDER THAN I AM BUT IT'S NOT BECAUSE ONLY THE LAST BY FIFTY SIXTY YEARS. THAT WE REALLY BEEN RAKING IN THE MONEY ON STUDENTS OF THAT I'VE SEEN BUT IT IS AN OLD CONVERSATION REALLY OLD OF THAT PEOPLE TALK ABOUT IF UNIVERSITIES PEOPLE TALK ABOUT. IN COMMUNITIES ALL THE TIME IS WHY CAN'T THE STUDENTS WHO OUT THERE WORKING I MEAN IT LITERALLY WORKING BECAUSE YOU CONSUME. THEIR DAYTIME ALL WE INTO THE EVENING FROM EARLY MORNING TO AFTER SPINAL SWIMMERS WHO HAD THIS WITH A FOUR O'CLOCK EVERY MORNING SAN DIEGO STATE. GO TO CLASS AND COME BACK AND EAT LUNCH OR WHATEVER AND THEN SWIM CLOSE TO SIX TO SEVEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT -- AND AND AND GET VERY LITTLE OUT OF IT. ONE OF MY STUDENTS AT LESS THAN A SEMESTER HAD MESSED UP ALL OF HER MUSCLES IN HER LAKE AND COULD NO LONGER SWIM AFTER AFTER ONE SEMESTER IT'S AN EAGLE STATE. AND SHE HAD NEVER TO TALK ABOUT THE DIFFICULTY IN THE TASK OF THE HARD WORK THAT WAS THERE -- AND IT'S A HARD JOB IT'S A HARD JOB BEING AN ATHLETE AND IF YOU YET AND AND AND THE DEMANDS ARE GREAT. NOT ONLY DO IN THE SEASON WHEN YOU'RE DOING WITH OFF SEASON AND SUMMER AS WELL AND IS VERY LOW COMPENSATION THAT COMES TO THOSE STUDENTS AND A FEW BECOME FAMOUS. SO BE IT BUT THE REST OF THEM ALL THEY GIVE AN AWFUL LOT AND GET VERY LITTLE IN RETURN. AND I THINK IT'S TIME TO BASICALLY PUSHED THE AGENDA. FOR AND TO MAKE SURE THAT -- NC. TWO EIGHT TAKES A SERIOUS LOOK AT ITSELF BECAUSE THIS HAD A COMMITTEE TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE. OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN EVERY TIME THE TOPIC COMES UP IS ALWAYS A DISCUSSION A WE'RE GONNA FORM A COMMITTEE WE DO A COMMITTEE WE GET A REPORT AND WE STILL DON'T DO ANYTHING -- AND AND STE AND AND WHO SUFFERS THE MOST OF THE ATHLETES. I'M OF THE BILL SECOND DOCTOR CHOI. THANK YOU CHAIR AND THE SENATORS SAW. NOW THIS IS MY SECOND TIME. AROUND HEARING. AT THE FIRST TIME I COULD NOT MAKE UP MY MIND THE AT THE ARTS ENTERTAINMENT AS POST COMMITTEE -- AND THE LISTENING TO OR BOTH SIDES OF OUR TESTIMONY -- MANY QUESTIONS THAT I HAD THE OR ARE NOW ANSWERED. I HAD TWO MAJOR QUESTIONS AT THAT TIME. WAS GONNA HAPPEN. IF BUT NOBODY YEARS SUCKED AT NC DOUBLE A WE'RE INSIST UPON ON THEIR CURRENT. A RULES AND THE STEM CALIFORNIA. INFOSYS ARE DIFFERENT RULED BY PASSING THIS -- AND WAS GONNA BE OF WHO'S GONNA WIN. AND AT THE THERE WERE SOME POTENTIAL THE ATHLETES SO WILL GET HURT -- THAT WAS MY FEAR BUT NOW. LISTENING TO THE LAWYERS SO INTERPRETATION I HOPE HIS CRACKED THE THAT THAT HE HAS SO MORE WINNING CHEN SO THAT GIVES ME A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT STONE SO -- THE SECOND QUESTION THAT I HAD WAS THAT SINCE THE CURRENT THE IS IT TO A IS -- STARTING WITH THE TASK FORCE SO. WHAT THE RULES THAT THEY CAN CHANGE -- HOWEVER -- I GOT THE END SO THAT THAT IT HAS BEEN FOR A LONG TIME THEY'VE BEEN ATTEMPTING ATTEMPTING TO CHANGE BUT THAT HAS NOT BEEN. NO DRASTIC CHANGE IT WAS THE THE THE LITTLE BIT THAT LITTLE BIT THAT NOT NOT SO MUCH OF OUR A FRIEND SO FROM CURRENT PRACTICE. AND THEN ALSO A READING -- OWNER -- CASES SO FOR STUDENTS -- BEING PENALIZED. WHO -- VIOLATED THE THE CURRENT NC DOUBLE A AND THAT THIS OF THOSE CHILDREN SO WHO -- COULD OF MADE A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY BUT WELL INTENDED CUP BUT THEY WAS -- THE RULES. OF VIOLATED -- AND THAT THEY WERE BANNED IN THE NEXT BED THE FROM THE MEMBERSHIP. SO I I THINK -- WE EVEN THOUGH I DO READ THAT THE AUTHORS -- INTENDING. TO MAKE A NC DOUBLE A TO THINK HARDER -- THAT THE DESIST TIME AND TO MAKE THEM. MOVE FORWARD AND IF WE I THINK THAT THIS. UP. WILL DEFINITELY UP. UP PROBLEM. UP THROUGH -- TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THREE UNTIL THE IMPLEMENTATION TIME TO SAY ENOUGH TIME. AND THE WEATHER ALSO SO WOULD BE PREPARED TO ALL OUR THE CHANGE OF RULES MAY TAKE PLAYS SO. ARE SO I I THINK THIS WOULD BE COULD PROMPTER -- TO CHANGE THE IN OCTOBER SITUATION THAT OUR ATHLETES ARE. OF PHASING SO WITH THEM MY OBSERVATION ON HEARING AND THAT THE I HAVE FOUND THE ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS THAT HAD THE SO. I WOULD LIKE -- TO CAST EIFFEL TODAY [inaudible] MR BLOOM. MR SURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- WHEN I OF FOR STARTED THINKING ABOUT -- TO ABOUT THIS BILL LIKE -- AND TALK TO BOTH SIDES I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE TURMOIL THAT THE THAT MAY WELL AND SU BY OUR ACTIONS AND THE THOUGHT. TO AS A RELATIVELY CAUTIOUS PERSON TURMOIL MAYBE THAT'S NOT SUCH A GOOD THING -- BUT I'M CONVINCED TODAY THAT NOTHING'S GOING TO CHANGE -- WITHOUT AT LEAST THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME -- A FOR SOME A TERM OTHERS THAT OLD SAYING THAT NOTHING NOTHING GOOD EVER CAME WITHOUT A STRUGGLE. AND SOMETHING HAS TO GIVE HERE I THINK THAT -- OF THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE HERE PARTICIPATING IN THIS HEARING ARE ARE HEARING. A FROM AROUND THE DICE THE SENSE THAT -- THE STATUS QUO IS UNACCEPTABLE AND SOMETHING NEEDS TO CHANGE AND THERE'S A SENSE OF GREAT FRUSTRATION I THINK JUSTIFIABLY. BOB WITH THE FACT THAT THIS ISSUE'S BEEN PERCOLATING FOR QUITE SOME TIME NOW. AND VERY LITTLE HAS CHANGED. SO I'M GONNA ASK A CAST MIKE -- I VOTE TODAY AS AS WELL -- AND HOPE THAT. THAT IS GOING TO HELP DRIVE -- NOT MAYBE A PERHAPS NOT EXACTLY THE CHANGE THAT I THINK IS BEST -- THAT THE AUTHOR THINKS IS BEST -- BUT THAT HELPS THE MOST PEOPLE WHO ARE -- REALLY I THINK THE PEOPLE THAT THE AUTHORS TRYING TO TO HELP HERE OF THE OF THOSE ATHLETES WHO ARE UNABLE -- TO ACCESS FUNDS THAT -- OUR SCHOOLS ARE ACCESSING QUITE EASILY. I I WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST. THAT -- OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND THE CSU SYSTEM. STAND UP AND AND TAKE A LEADERSHIP ROLE ON THIS ISSUE -- I'M NOT HEARING THAT. TODAY. FIVE I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE REGENTS -- TO CONSIDER THIS ISSUE AND TAKE A POSITION ON IT AND PROVIDE SOME LEADERSHIP RATHER THAN -- FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I THINK THERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IS -- WHO WERE WAITING FOR THINGS TO HAPPEN AND NOT -- TO HELPING TO A DRIVE THE ISSUE FORWARD SO -- I HOPE TO HEAR WITH ANNA AND I HOPE THAT THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME I HOPE THAT WE'R NOT GOING TO BE HERE -- IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE ARE CLOSE -- TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND THERE'S FEVERS NEGOTIATIONS HAPPENING AT THAT POINT IN TIME LET'S NOT WAIT LET'S LET'S DEAL WITH THE ISSUE NOW AND MOVE SOMETHING FORWARD IN THAT IN THE NEAR TERM IF IT'S GOING TO BE COMPROMISED. THANK YOU -- AND IF I MAY WITH THE I'M GONNA MAKE SOME COMMENTS AND THEN I'LL GO BACK TO THE SENATORS FOR THEIR CLOSING -- THANK YOU TO ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR VERY -- INSIGHTFUL AND QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS I I WOULD SAY WHEN I FIRST. HAD A THE ISSUE IN FRONT OF ME I SHARED OF MY COLLEAGUES -- MISTER PATTERSON IS A CONCERN OF WHAT EFFECT WILL THIS HAVE. ON ON COLLEGE SPORTS AND AND I JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT I HAD TO COLLEGE EXPERIENCES. BOTH VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER I STARTED MY COLLEGE CAREER -- AT A BIG TEN UNIVERSITY -- IN INDIANA AT PURDUE UNIVERSITY DIVISION ONE WHERE I SHARED CLASSES IN LATIN AMERICAN HISTORY WITH THE MANY ATHLETES FOOTBALL PLAYERS TRACK PLAYERS BASKETBALL PLAYERS MATTER OF FACT. HAD THE FEELING THAT I'M MIGHT HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE FEW NON ATHLETES IN THE CLASS. BUT I ALSO ENJOYED THE THE LEVEL OF COMPETITIONA BIG TEN UNIVERSITY AND FOOTBALL AND BASKETBALL. AND AND HAD ONE EXPERIENCE AT THAT PURDUE UNIVERSITY AND THEN TRANSFERRED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AT RIVERSIDE THAT WAS THEN DIVISION. TWO HAD A FOOTBALL TEAM THAT THAT THE STUDENTS -- VOTED TO END IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR THE YEAR I GRADUATED. AND AND CERTAINLY WAS NOT THE SAME -- EXPERIENCE AS A AS A BIG TEN UNIVERSITY OF THAT PRODUCE AS BOTH WERE VERY VALUABLE BUT BOTH. WERE VERY DIFFERENT AND AND TO DOCTOR WEBER WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS ON ON THE VALUE OF THAT HAVE. ATHLETICS ON THE STUDENT BODY AND STUDENT BODIES MAKE DIFFERENT DECISIONS. TO THIS ISSUE THAT I REALLY WASN'T ALL THAT FAMILIAR WITH -- WHEN THE THE BILL CAME TO MY COMMITTEE? I REACHED OUT TO THOSE FOLKS WHO I KNEW THAT HAD PLAYED IN ATHLETICS. I I WENT AND I READ -- KAREEM ABDUL JABBAR'S COMMENTS OF HIM GOING HUNGRY. AS A COLLEGE STUDENT AT UCLA AS WITH WHEN HE PLAYED BASKETBALL AT UCLA AND AND YOU KNOW I I WAS. SURPRISED. BY THAT COMMENT. I I WENT TO MY FORMER NEIGHBOR. SAM NIGHT WHO PLAYED BASKETBALL FOR RIVERSIDE COMMUNITY COLLEGE I THINK YOU MAY HAVE PLAYED FOR COACH TARKANIAN -- WHEN UNDERLYING BEACH AND THEN THE U. N. L. V. HE HAD THREE SONS? HE HAD THREE SONS ALL OF WHOM WHO PLAYED FOOTBALL AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ALL OF THEM RUNNING BACKS AT USC. AND THEN THE FATHER SAM WAS MY MY NEIGHBOR DOWN THE STREET AND I SAID SAM WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS. YOU KNOW WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS ISSUE. AND HE SHARED WITH ME VERY HONESTLY. THAT AS A FATHER OF THOSE THREE ATHLETES HE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY IF HIS SONS WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BENEFIT. MATTER OF FACT ONE OF HIS SONS THE OLDEST IN THE FIRST ONE TO PLAY IT AT USC CAME ON THE LINE AND SAID THAT HE WOULD SUPPORT THIS. AS WELL TO A PERSON. THERE WAS NO ONE THAT I TALKED TO WHETHER THEY WERE HIGH SCHOOL COACHES OUR FORMER ATHLETES. HAD OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. SO I I THINK THAT -- THE BILL IS IS DEFINITELY WHAT IS NEEDED -- THAT THE NC DOUBLE A NEEDS TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT ITSELF. THAT -- IT IS TIME THAT WE GIVE ATHLETES WHAT IS FAIR. AND YOU CAN NOT ASK I DON'T THINK ATHLETES WERE COACHES MAKE ALMOST HALF A MILLION DOLLARS AND BRING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO A PROGRAM. NOT TO BENEFIT FROM THEIR WHAT THEY ARE DOING. SO I THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT -- THIS AFTERNOON. AND WITH THAT -- CENTER SKINNER IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER WE HAD A GOOD DISCUSSION IT'S INTERESTING THAT YOU REFERENCED KAREEM ABDUL JABBAR BECAUSE HE WAS THE FIRST PERSON THAT I HEARD TO REALLY BRING THIS TO MY ATTENTION AND WE'RE TALKING BACK IN THE SEVENTIES. AND THEN I HAD THE BENEFIT OF AT CAL -- LISTENING TO LECTURES BY PROFESSOR HARRY EDWARDS SOCIOLOGIST WHO OF COURSE HAS CHAMPION THIS NOW FOR A GOOD FIFTY YEARS. AND YOU CAN'T HELP IF YOU WOULD LISTEN TO ANY SPORTS CHANNEL ANY COMMENTATORS ATHLETES THEY REFERENCE THIS ALL THE TIME SO AND THEY HAVE FOR YEARS. SO I THINK -- AS HAS BEEN POINTED OUT THE NOTION THAT SOMEHOW THE NC TWO EIGHT JUST NEEDS A LITTLE MORE TIME. WE ARE GIVING IT TO THEM BUT THEY HAVE CERTAINLY HAD AMPLE -- THERE IS A CONGRESSIONAL BILL RIGHT NOW CONGRESS MEMBER MARK WALKER REPUBLICAN CONGRESS MEMBER CEDRIC RICHMOND A DEMOCRAT HAVE INTRODUCED A BILL. TO DO ALMOST IDENTICAL TO THIS IT'S GOING TO CONGRESS THERE ARE OTHER STATES WERE LOOKING THIS IS A NATIONAL CONVERSATION IT'S NOT GOING AWAY. AND I THINK IT IS -- IT IS SOMETHING THAT CALIFORNIA DOES WHICH IS LEADS WE HAVE MUCH EXPERIENCE WITH HELPING TO BE THE CATALYST FOR IMPORTANT CHANGE WE ALSO HAVE MUCH EXPERIENCE WITH ARMAGEDDON THREATS. FROM ENTRENCHED INTERESTS CORPORATIONS UP AND DOWN THE STATE SAID THEY'D LEAVE OUR STATE WHEN WE DEMANDED GENDER PAY EQUITY THEY HAVE NOT LEFT -- THERE'S BEEN THREATS OF JOB LOSS AND ECONOMIC DOOM WHEN WE ADOPTED OUR BOLD. CLIMATE PROTECTION LAWS WE ARE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD WE'VE WE STOOD THOSE CONSEQUENCES OR THREATS AND DIE WITH THAT -- I WOULD TURN TO MY A JOINT AUTHOR AND OF COURSE I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK ALL THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE AND THE WITNESSES FOR THE GREAT DISCUSSION AND DEBATE AS IT RELATES TO THIS ISSUE. AND AS I SAID HERE I THOUGHT ABOUT MY SIXTEEN YEARS OF COACHING FOOTBALL AND BASEBALL -- BEFORE IT MADE IT TO THE LEGISLATURE AND I USED TO TALK TO THE YOUNG. MEN WHO ARE WERE ALREADY AT TEN TWELVE THIRTEEN IN TRAVEL CLUBS AND PARENTS SCRAMBLING TO HIRE TRAINERS AND COACHES AND THESE KIDS WERE POORLY IDA. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL JUST GOING TO MIDDLE SCHOOL AND THEY WERE ALREADY BEING PURSUED BY. COACHES AND LIKE YOU SAY TRAVEL CLUBS AND THE COST OF PLAYING A GAME THAT THEY LOVED AND HOW PARENTS SCRAMBLED. SCRAPE TOGETHER JUST TO KEEP THEIR KIDS COMPETITIVE I REMEMBER WRITING A CHECK TO IT A FAMILY SO THERE KEY IT COULD GO TO A TOURNAMENT UP IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. ADD. I LISTEN TO THESE PARENTS AND I USED TO TELL THE STUDENTS IF YOU GET NOTHING OUT OF SPORTS. GET A COLLEGE EDUCATION. BUT IT'S THERE IN COLLEGE WHERE THESE ATHLETES ARE BEING EXPLOITED THE MOST. I ATTENDED SAN DIEGO STATE AS DOCTOR WEBER STATED I WENT TO SCHOOL WITH TONY GOING AND I WENT TO SCHOOL WOOD BURNING DEAN ANYONE ON THE PLANET SUPER BOWL. CLINT SAMPSON WHO PLAYED IN SUPER BOWL MICHAEL CAGE PLAYED IN THE NBA BUT MANY OF THESE ATHLETES WHILE ON CAMPUS STRUGGLE. JUST TO KEEP. THE LIGHTS ARE ON FOOD ON THEIR PLATES. AND IF THEY HAD A CAR LEGACY GAS IN THEIR CAR THESE ATHLETES EVEN ON SCHOLARSHIP WERE STRUGGLING. AND THIS IS ABOUT. AS WE STATED FAIRNESS AND THE NC TO A HAS HIT THEIR HEAD IN THE SAND FOR FAR TOO LONG. THERE ARE ANTIQUATED BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY THAT IS USED ATHLETES PRIMARILY AFRICAN AMERICAN ATHLETES AS CHATTEL. FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS AND THE ONLY REASON WE HAVE THE TERM OF STUDENT ATHLETE WAS TO DENY EIGHT INJURED ATHLETES IN THE FIFTIES MEDICAL BENEFITS FOR KNEE INJURY THAT COLLEGE DID NOT WANT TO PAY. SO THE NCAA IS THE REASON WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY. BECAUSE YOU HAVE FAILED TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE OF FAIRNESS. AND AT THE SAME TIME THE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WERE PUT THEIR HANDS UP. THAT'S ARE YOU SEE AND YOU A CSU. YOU ARE THE BOSS OF THE NC TO LET YOU MAKE UP WHAT THE NCAA IS SO IT'S UP TO YOU THE RAISE YOUR VOICE. AS OUR GOVERNOR STATED. CALIFORNIA'S THE NEXT COMING ATTRACTIONS. THIS IS A FINE EXAMPLE OF CALIFORNIA LEADING THE WAY AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL.
