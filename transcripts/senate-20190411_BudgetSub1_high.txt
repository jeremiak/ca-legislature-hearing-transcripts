ARE WONDERING WE WILL GO WE'RE GOING TO GO AND IN ORDER ON THE AGENDA WE WILL START WITH ITEM SIXTY EIGHT SEVENTY CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. ISSUE NUMBER ONE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA. EACH OF THE ITEMS ON THE AGENDA TODAY IS EITHER A HOLD OPEN ITEM OR AN INFORMATIONAL ITEMS WILL BE WE WILL BE TAKING NO VOTES TODAY. OKAY I THINK WE'RE WAITING FOR SOMEONE. SO MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE SIR GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE FACILITIES [inaudible] OR I SEE. WE'RE NOT USUALLY THIS ORGANIZED BUT PART OF THE PROBLEM IS WE HAD A CAUCUS AFTER SESSION AND SO NOBODY KNEW HOW LONG THE **** IS EXAM LAST SO WE COULDN'T SAYS. THE CIVICS ARE TIMES OR HAVE BEEPING PEOPLE WHO ARE -- NOT ELECTED IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHEN TO SHOW UP DOWN HERE AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT WE MADE THEIR JOB ABOUT AS DIFFICULT AS WE POSSIBLY COULD UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES SO. WE'RE GOING TO SHIFT GEARS WE'RE GOING TO TAKE ISSUE NUMBER FOUR FACILITIES FIRST. AND TALK ABOUT THAT AND THEN FIGURE OUT WHO'S AROUND. TO DEAL WITH THE OTHER ISSUES AND PERHAPS WE'LL START BACK IN ORDER ON THE AGENDA SO ISSUE NUMBER FOUR AT FACILITIES. GENTLEMAN IF YOU'D IDENTIFY YOURSELVES FOR THE RECORD STARTING TO MY LEFT YOU'RE RIGHT. AT THE CONTROL OF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE RALPH THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. READY CATS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. IT JUST GETS CHRISTIAN US MANY WITH THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THANK YOU SIR. OKAY WHO WANTS TO START THIS. ONE THANK YOU SENATOR ROSS -- THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY CAPITAL OUTLAY PROPOSALS FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL PROVIDES THREE HUNDRED SIXTY ONE MILLION IN GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND A FORTY FOUR FIFTEEN CONTINUING AND FIFTEEN NEW COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROJECTS STATEWIDE. FOR THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY ADMINISTRATION PROPOSALS BE APPROVED SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR MILLION OF THE TWO BILLION IMPROV FIFTY ONE FUNDS PROVIDED FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES WOULD BE OBLIGATED. CONSISTENT WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S CRITERIA FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY FUNDING FOR A STATEWIDE THE PROJECT RECOMMENDED FOR FUNDING ADDRESS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE FIRE LIFE SAFETY ISSUES. WELL FIRE LIFE SAFETY ISSUES AREN'T NECESSARILY THE SOLE REASON FOR A COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROJECT TO BE CONSIDERED FOR FUNDING IT SHOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT DRIVER. WHEN DETERMINING WHICH PROJECTS TO BE FUNDED THE ADMINISTRATION CONSIDERS WHETHER A REQUESTING DISTRICT CAN PROVIDE SOME LEVEL OF FUNDING MATCH OR IF THERE ARE EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES THAT PREVENTED DISTRICT FROM CONTRIBUTING? AN EXAMPLE OF THE LATTER WOULD INCLUDE REDWOOD COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT A SMALL DISTRICT WAS SIGNIFICANT INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS RESULTING FROM RECENT SEISMIC ANALYSES -- WE NOTE THAT CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSED APPROACH AND THAT IT WOULD CREATE -- I BELIEVE THAT -- CREATE A DISINCENTIVE FOR DISTRICTS TO MAINTAIN THE FACILITY -- HOWEVER WE DISAGREE THAT -- COLLEGES WOULD PURPOSELY ALLOW THEIR BUILDINGS TO FALL INTO DISREPAIR IN ORDER TO ACCESS THE REMAINING ONE POINT THREE BILLION AND ON OBLIGATED PROP FIFTY ONE FONT -- WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT -- FOR PART OF THE REASON IS BECAUSE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ALREADY KNOW IT'S A SIXTEEN POINT SIX BILLION DOLLAR. NEED IN STATE FUNDS ARE SO AS WELL IN EXCESS OF WHAT REMAINS. WELL I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS BUT I THINK I'LL WAIT TO EVERYBODY ELSE THE PRESENTS -- ROLE WITH THE LA -- SO WE HAVE TO TO GENERAL -- COMMENTS ON UNRELATED TO COMMIT CALLED FACILITIES. FIRST IT'S MORE OF A HIGH LEVEL -- SHOULD TERMS OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PROJECTS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THIS BUDGET. I'M AS WE NOTED IN OUR ANALYSIS THERE -- THIS ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROOF SUBSTANTIALLY MORE PROJECTS THAN THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION HAD INCLUDED. WE THINK THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I THINK WE HAVE -- CONCERNS IN THE LAST FEW YEARS THAT -- THERE WERE NOT VERY MANY PROJECTS APPROVED IN THE BUDGET AND THAT THAT MEANS WE WOULD BE A VERY SLOW PACE TO EXHAUST THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS FROM PROP. FIFTY ONE I'M EVEN NOW WITH THESE ADDITIONAL -- PROJECTS APPROVED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WERE STOLEN PACE FOR ABOUT EIGHT OR NINE YEARS UNTIL -- PROP FIFTY ONE FUNDING WOULD BE COMPLETELY EXHAUSTED. AND WE THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER -- APPROVING EVEN MORE PROJECTS IN THE IN THE BUDGET CONSIDERING THAT THE THE REASON WHY -- PROPERTY ONE FUNDS HAVE BEEN SO SLOW IN GETTING ROLLED OUT IS NOT BECAUSE OF THE MAN FROM THE COLLEGES AS YOU CAN SEE FROM YOUR AGENDA. ON PAGE TWENTY SEVEN IS A AN ENTIRE PAGE OF PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE THAT WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET. I'M SO WE DO THINK THAT YOU ARE YOU MIGHT ANT TO CONSIDER ADDING ADDITIONAL -- OFF OF THE ONE BOND SPENDING TO TO FIND MORE PROJECTS. AND THE THE SECOND ISSUE IS -- MR GOVERNMENTS IN LITTLE BIT AS WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE THE WAY THAT FINANCE IS LOOKING AT THESE -- LEASING LACKED THE LIFE SAFETY CRITERIA AS A FILTER FOR DECIDING WHICH PROJECTS TO INCLUDE -- WE ARE CONCERNED THAT -- THE THE FIFTH MEANS THAT THERE ARE SOME PROJECTS -- THAT ARE THAT IT THAT IT YOU KNOW YOU'RE APPROVING A PROJECT IN SOME DISTRICTS WHERE THEY DONE A POOR JOB OF MAINTAINING THE BUILDINGS -- BUT THE THE CHANCES OF IT HAS A LONG ESTABLISHED APPROACH -- TO PROVING PROJECT AND THEY HAVE A LIFE FIFTY CATEGORY SPECIFICALLY TO HAVE SOME SPECIFIC RULES. AND THEN THEY HAVE SEVERAL OTHER CATEGORIES THAT ARE NOT ABOUT LIFE EITHER ABOUT INCREASING INSTRUCTIONAL CAPACITY AND MODERNIZING FACILITIES -- WE DON'T THINK THAT WITH THOSE THOSE CATEGORIES THERE NEEDS TO BE THERE ADDITIONAL LIFE FIFTY LINES AND THE WAY THAT THE THE THIS APPROACH PLAYS OUT IS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. FOR EXAMPLE -- TO TO DISTRICTS WHERE APPLICATIONS TO HAVE A THIRTY YEAR OLD BUILDINGS MODERNIZED. AND EVERYONE DISTRICT HAS DONE A GOOD JOB OF MAINTAINING THEIR BUILDING SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY LIKE SAFETY ISSUES. THEY ARE WOULD BE WOULD GET LEFT PRIOR EVEN A DISTRICT WHO'S THIRTY YEAR OLD BUILDING IS IN PAIN -- DISREPAIR I'M SO WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT SENDING THE WRONG SIGNALS TOOK TO COMPLETE COLLEGE OF AND SO WE WE WOULD RECOMMEND -- THAT WE RECOMMEND DIRECTING THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE CHANCES OFFICE TO DEVELOP ONE SET OF CRITERIA -- FOR IDENTIFYING -- UP FRONT -- FOR DECIDING HOW TO ADDRESS LIKE FIFTY PROJECTS. WE WE WE KNOW ALSO IN ADDITION TO US HAVING CONCERNS ABOUT THAT WE ALSO HAVE HEARD FROM DISTRICTS THAT THEY'RE JUST VERY CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY THE PROCESS IF AND WHAT WHAT IS THE WHAT IS THE RATIONALE FOR WHETHER PROJECTS ARE BEING REJECTED -- IF IF THERE CAN'T BE AN AGREEMENT IF THE LEDGES THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE AND THE CHANCELLOR'S CAN COME TO AN AGREEMENT THAT WE WOULD RECOMMEND THE LET'S SAY YOU COULD CODIFY SOMETHING IN STATUTE. THAT MADE THAT -- HAS AN APPROACH THAT DOES -- HAVE A PROCESS OF THE DISTRICTS CAN GET FUNDING FOR LIFE SAFETY ISSUES WHILE STILL ENSURING THAT THERE IS A STRONG FISCAL INCENTIVE TO MAINTAIN YOUR BUILDINGS. RIGHT ARM. YOUR AGENDA DUKE BY A GREAT JOB OF HIGHLIGHTING OF WHAT WE DO IN TERMS OF PRIVATIZATION BECAUSE I WOULD SAY I THINK THE ISSUE BEFORE THE COMMITTEE -- IS DIFFERENCES IN PRIVATIZATION BETWEEN -- WITH THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES DOES WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DO -- I AM WORKING OFF OF THIS HAND OUT OF IT AND I AM STARTING TO FACILITIES -- MATERIAL STARTS ON PAGE. FOURTEEN YOU ALL THE GOVERNOR THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT US EVERY YEAR TO PRODUCE A FIVE YEAR PLAN. OUR MOST RECENT FIVE YEAR PLAN ESTIMATES THE NEED OF THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS FOR CAPITAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. ABOUT ELEVEN BILLION OF THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH ENROLLMENT GROWTH. TWENTY BILLION ASSOCIATED WITH MODERNIZATION OF EXISTING FACILITIES TO MEET OUR CURRENT PROGRAM TO MEET. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT. MOST CAPITAL OUTLAY FUNDING INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING IN THE SYSTEM IS LOCAL FUNDING SO WE ARE BUILDING ON LOCAL FUNDING -- WITH THE STATE BOND PROGRAM THROUGH PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE DISTRICTS ALSO GENERATE SIGNIFICANT FUNDING FROM OTHER SORTS OF SOURCES FOR THEIR FACILITIES. AND SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE FIFTEEN WE CERTAINLY. CAN'T MEET THAT THIRTY BILLION DOLLAR DEMAND TODAY AND SO WE GO THROUGH A PROCESS OF THE SYSTEM TO PRIOR TO PRIORITIZE PROJECTS -- THAT ARE SUBMITTED FOR STATE FUNDS IF YOU LOOK AT THE CHART ON THE RIGHT FROM THE TOP SLIDE. YOU'LL SEE WHAT MR BRAWL HAS NOTED THE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED -- PROJECTS THAT MEET A VERY STRICT FIRE LIFE SAFETY DEFINITION ARE INCLUDED IN OUR REQUEST -- PROJECTS THAT DO NOT MEET THAT STRICT DEFINITION THOUGH MAY STILL HAVE FIRE LIFE SAFETY COMPONENTS IS THE PART OF FINANCE NOTES. ARE PRIORITIZED BASED ON THOSE CATEGORIES THE FIVE ADDITIONAL CATEGORIES INCLUDED THERE. INCREASING INCREASING INSTRUCTIONAL CAPACITY MODERNIZING SPACE I COMPLETING A CAMPUS TO BECOME A COMPREHENSIVE CAMPUS INCREASING OUR SUPPORT FACILITIES AND MODERNIZING SUPPORT FACILITIES WE TRY TO BALANCE OUR PRIMARY GOAL -- IN THIS -- PROCESS IS BALANCING ACROSS -- MODERNIZATION AND GROWTH AND BALANCING ACROSS INSTRUCTION AND SUPPORT SPACES. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE BOTTOM OF PART OF THAT SLIDE A YOU'LL SEE WITHIN EACH OF THOSE CATEGORIES THEN. WE APPLY ADDITIONAL PRIVATIZATION -- FACTORS FOR PROJECTS THAT ARE IN THE GROWTH CATEGORY WE CONSIDER HOW MUCH GROWTH OF THE COLLEGES PROJECTING WHAT THE EXISTING CAPACITY IS. WHAT THE NEEDED TYPES OF SPACE ARE AND WHAT THE LOCAL CONTRIBUTION AS? FOR MODERNIZATION PROJECTS WE CONSIDER THE AGE OF THE BUILDING THE CURRENT USE OF SPACE THE LOCAL CONTRIBUTION. AMOUNT FOR THOSE IN OUR COMPLETE CAMPUS CATEGORY WE CONSIDER AGE PROGRAM CHANGES PROGRAM DECIDED LOCAL CONTRIBUTION. MOVING ON THEN TO ART OF THE NEXT PAGE PAGE SIXTEEN ARE CLEAR REQUEST FROM THE COMMITTEE THIS YEAR -- IS TO APPROVE THE PROJECTS -- SUBMITTED BY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS TO THE GOVERNOR LEGISLATURE REQUESTING NINETEEN CONTINUING PROJECTS FOR A TOTAL OF FIVE HUNDRED THREE MILLION DOLLARS. AND THIRTY NINE NEW PROJECTS FOR A TOTAL OF FORTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OF THOSE NEW PROJECTS THE COSTS ARE FOR THE PRELIMINARY PLANS FOR THE WORKING DRAWINGS FACES. AGAIN AS OF BOTH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYSTS HAVE NOTED -- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FUNDS FIFTEEN OF THE CONTINUING PROJECTS AND FIFTEEN NEW PROJECTS. ALL CLOSE BY JUST TALKING ABOUT FUTURE ACTIONS RELATED TO CAPITAL OUTLAY -- THEY WERE NOTED IN YOUR AGENDA -- WE ARE WORKING TO SEE HOW OR INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS I CAN FURTHER THE VISION FOR SUCCESS IN THERE TO REALLY -- ISSUES THAT WE ARE MOST INTERESTED IN THINKING ABOUT HOW INFRASTRUCTURE MIGHT BE BETTER INTEGRATED TO SUPPORT COMPREHENSIVE GUIDED PATHWAYS -- WHETHER THIS DISTINCTION BETWEEN INSTRUCTIONAL SPACE AND SUPPORT SPACE CONTINUES TO MAKE SENSE. AND THEN WHETHER IN OUR PRIORITIZATION OF PROJECTS WE SHOULD BE CONSIDERING THE EQUITY GAPS THAT WE SEE ACROSS REGIONS ACROSS GROUPS OF STUDENTS. THE VISION FOR SUCCESS IDENTIFIES REGIONS -- OF PARTICULARLY LOW PERFORMANCE THE EMINEM HIGHER THE CENTRAL VALLEY THE FAR NORTH AND WE ARE LOOKING AT WAYS IN WHICH WE MIGHT THINK ABOUT HOW THOSE GAPS. ARE AFFECTED BY THE ACCESS TO QUALITY FACILITIES THESE DISCUSSIONS ARE VERY PRELIMINARY AND WE WILL SEE -- WE WILL BE SEEKING CONSULTATION TO OUR FORMAL INTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS CONSTANT CONSULTATION PROCESS. HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. WELL LET ME START BY ASKING THIS QUESTION WHY DON'T WE BEFORE I GET INTO HOW THIS FACILITY ALLOCATION. FUND MONEY ALLOCATION PROCESS WORKS WORKS WHICH I COULD CONFESSES CONFUSING TO ME. WHY DON'T WE JUST ISSUE THE REST OF THE BONDS? SO THE REST OF THE BONDS AND HAVE A PRIORITY LIST IN. APPROPRIATE PRIORITY LIST WILL GET TO THAT AND START AT THE TOP. AND THEN FIX WHAT WE CAN AND THEN. FIGURE OUT WHAT THE NEXT STEP IS GOING TO BE. AND I'M NOT BEING CRITICAL -- I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING THAT ADMINISTRATION IS DOING. TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY FLOWING THROUGH THE PIPELINE TO GET SOME OF THESE BUILDINGS AND PROJECTS. BUILDING FIXED IN PROJECTS -- GOING SO BUT I AM CURIOUS AS TO IT'S A RELATIVELY. SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY GIVEN THE MONEY WE DEAL WITH HERE. YEAH -- I'LL BE HAPPY TO TAKE A OR AT LEAST TAKE THE FIRST STEP -- ANSWERING THIS AND CAN GUIDE ME IF I'M GOING A BIT OFF COURSE YOU KNOW YOU HAD ME [inaudible] BUT THE BOND IT MEASURE ITSELF REQUIRES THAT THERE BE A LEGISLATIVE APPROPRIATION AND SOUNDS LIKE YOUR QUESTION IS WHY NOT JUST ONE LET JUST LET ONE APPROPRIATION. TWO BILLION OR STAY THE REMAINING ONE POINT SIX BILLION. COMMITTEE COLLEGE PROJECTS. AND I THINK -- PART OF THE CONCERN FROM THE MINISTRATIONS SIDE WOULD BE JUST KIND OF THE LEVEL OF REVIEW TO MAKE SURE IT'S THE HIGHEST QUALIFYING PROJECTS BUT THAT'S PRETTY MUCH RESTATING SOME OF THE THINGS THAT CONCERNS THAT WE'VE HAD OVER TIME. ON THE OTHER ONE IS A BIT MORE -- MAYBE A BIT MORE INTO THE WEEDS BUT IT'S THE NATURE OF HOW WE SELL THE BONDS THAT IS THE TYPICAL PRACTICE IN CAPITAL OUTLAY WEATHER'S BOND FUNDED OR OR CAST FUNDED. THAT YOU ONLY PROVIDE THE AUTHORITY FOR THE PHASES THAT ARE NEEDED SO FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S THERE'S FIVE CONTINUING PROJECTS THAT ARE NOT FUNDED. FOR FOUR OF THEM IT'S JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT READY THEY'RE NOT EXPECTED TO ADVANCE TO THE POINT. WHERE THEY WOULD NEED TO CONSTRUCTION I SEE SO YOU NEED TO RETAIN ENOUGH FUNDS? BUTTER AVAILABLE FUNDS IN THE FUTURE TO COMPLETE PROJECTS THAT YOU'VE ALREADY STARTED. IF YOU SPEND IT ALL YOUR BOND FUNDS. ON THE PRELIMINARY WORK IN THE PARTIAL WORK ON THE PROJECT AND YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF UNFINISHED STUFF LAYING AROUND THE STATE IS THAT. THAT'S FINE WAY MCEACHERN'S THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING OKAY I GET THAT. SO THEN LET ME TALK ABOUT. LET ME TALK ABOUT THIS RATHER OF CONFUSING TO ME PROCESS WHEREBY THE CALIFORNIA. COMMUNITY COLLEGE ANSWERS OFFICE ORDERS PRIORITY IN TERMS OF OF HEALTH AND SAFETY AND OTHER PROJECTS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. AND THEN THE LIST GOES. TO THE FIRST FLOOR [inaudible] AND THEN. A NEW LIST POPS OUT AT LEAST THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING. SOMETIMES THE PROJECTS ARE REORDERED SOMETIMES THERE ADDITIONAL PROJECTS THERE OF NEW PROJECTS ARE ADDED IN ALL PROJECTS REMOVED [inaudible] I THINK -- IN TERMS OF WHAT WHAT IS PROPOSED TO BE FUNDED FELL. I WOULD SAY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S LIST IS WOULD BE A SUBSET OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT MISSION. OKAY SO. THEY GIVE YOU ONE THROUGH TWENTY AND YOU WHAT COMES AT THE END OF YOUR PIPE IS ONE THROUGH. TEN BUT IT MIGHT NOT BE THE FIRST TEN YOU SKIP AROUND IN THE LIST AND IT MIGHT BE THE NUBER ONE AND NUMBER THREE AND NUMBER SIX IN. NUMBER NINE AND NUMBER TEN WHATEVER THE NUMBERS ARE TO GET THE TEN PROJECTS IS THAT ABOUT RIGHT -- WE WOULD HAVE A WE WOULD HAVE A DIRECT. IT WOULDN'T BE QUITE AS SIMPLE AS A SAYING. OKAY COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE'RE JUST GOING TO IMPROVE THOSE THAT ARE PRIME NUMBERS -- AND AND SAID WE'LL LOOK AT EACH ONE INDIVIDUALLY BASED ON OUR CRITERIA. AND SO IN THIS CASE OTHER. THIRTY NINE NEW REQUEST ABOUT FIFTEEN MET THE ADMINISTRATION'S CRITERIA ORDERS MIKE HERE'S MY CONCERN -- K. THROUGH TWELVE IZZY EQUALLY -- BOGGLING TO MIND BOGGLING TO ME BUT THIS IS PARTICULARLY SO BECAUSE I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHEN. DISTRICTS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS COME TO ME. NOT IN THIS CAPACITY BUT IN THE PAST. DISTRICTS THAT AREN'T EVEN IN MY SENATE DISTRICT. AND ASK ME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SELECTION CRITERIA AND HOW ONE DISTRICT MADE A LIST AND HOW THE OTHER DIDN'T AND HOW. THEY RUN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE ONE DISTRICT IS ON THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES LIST BUT IT DOESN'T. MANAGE TO MAKE ITS WAY TO THE FINAL DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LIST. AND I DON'T HAVE AN EXPLANATION FOR THEM. BECAUSE I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THE THE SELECTIONS ARE MADE AND TO BE FRANK -- I'VE NEVER REALLY HAD A EXPLANATION. WHEN I ASK QUESTIONS THAT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO REALLY UNDERSTAND AND THEN IN TURN ARTICULATE BACK TO THE DISTRICTS THAT HAVE APPROACHED ME? AS TO WHY THEY DIDN'T GET PICKED BECAUSE THIS IT WILL LOOK AT THE HEALTH THE HEALTH AND SAFETY PROJECT. AND IT MAY BE A MATH AND SCIENCE BUILDING. BUT THEN I SAID WELL LOOK THIS DISTRICT OVER HERE ON THE COAST THAT DISTRICT GOT A MAT MATH AND SCIENCE BUILDING THAT HAD A HEALTH AND SAFETY. ISSUE IS THE SAME PRIORITY ONE TWO THREE FOUR WHATEVER YOU CLASSIFY THEM AS OUR FINANCE WHOEVER HAS A CLASSIFICATION. AND I SAY I DON'T KNOW. AND I'M I GUESS I'M. I'M I I OWN A LECTURE I GUESS WHAT I'M ASKING IS THAT WE FIGURE OUT A WAY TO DO. TO DESIGN A PROCESS. THAT IS MORE TRANSPARENT WE'RE GOING IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE STANDARDS ARE. THAT THEY HAVE TO MEET RECOGNIZING WILL NEVER HAVE ENOUGH MONEY. THAT HAS A PRIORITIZATION SYSTEM ATTACHED TO IT SO THEY CAN SORT OF FIGURE OUT WHETHER THEY'RE IN THE TOP 25% OF THE BOTTOM 25%. AND THEY KNOW WHAT THE CHANCES ARE SO AT THE END OF THE DAY WHEN THEY'RE DISAPPOINTED. AS OBVIOUSLY SOME OF THEM ARE GOING TO BE THEY UNDERSTAND. WHY THE DIS DISAPPOINTMENT IS FLOWING THEIR WAY I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE NOT THIS IS NOT IN THE SENATE DISTRICT? SO IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ME PERSONALLY -- DISTRICT CAME TO ME THEY SAID WE HAVE A WE HAD A VERY WE HAD A HIGH PRIORITY HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUE HAVING TO DO WITH THE SCIENCE BUILDING -- GROSS ANATOMY LABS AND ALL THIS OTHER STUFF THAT APPARENTLY THEM I DON'T KNOW WHETHER WAS H. FEES VENTILATION ISSUE OR WHAT. THEY HAD TO MOVE ALL THOSE THINGS OUT AND THEY SET HIM UP IN PORTABLES. WHAT THEY TOLD ME I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S? ACCURATE. I'M JUST REPORTING. IS IT BECAUSE THEY RELOCATED THEIR LABS IN PORTABLE FACILITIES ON THE CAMPUS AT CUT THEM OUT OF THE PROCESS. FOR OBTAINING A HEALTH AND SAFETY. OF A PROJECT APPROVAL IN THIS SYSTEM WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW AGAIN I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'S ACCURATE OR NOT. BUT IF IT IS OR EVEN PART OF IT IS ACCURATE I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO LOOK AT SO YOU HAVE A IF YOU HAVE A DISTRICT IS ATTEMPTING TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE. EVEN ON A TEMPORARY BASIS AND THEN DOESN'T QUALIFY -- FOR CONSIDERATION OR APPROVAL ON ONE OF THESE PROJECTS LIST -- MAYBE THERE WERE HIGHER PRIORITY PROJECTS -- MAYBE THERE WAS A REASON. BUT THE DIFFICULTY IS THE REASONS NOT CLEARLY COMMUNICATED TO THE DISTRICT SO THEY DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PROBLEM IS. AND THEN THEY COME TO PEOPLE IF SOMEBODY LIKE ME AND I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT EITHER SO. I GUESS WHAT I'M ASKING IS THAT WE FIGURE OUT -- A BETTER WAY. TO DISCONNECT WHEN IT COMES. TO IDENTIFYING THESE PROJECTS GRADING THEM SCORING THEM LISTING THEM. BECAUSE IT'S IT'S ALMOST LIKE I DON'T KNOW THE SELECTION OF THE POPE. IN A PUFF OF SMOKE COMES OUT OF THE TOP OF THE CAPITAL AND WE GET A LIST AND NOBODY REALLY KNOWS. WHO VOTED FOR WATER HOW YOU MADE IT TO THE LIST AND? AND IF IT'S NOT YOUR LIST YEAH THEN YOU CAN EXPLAIN IT CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. AND I DON'T KNOW -- WHAT HAPPENS ON THE FIRST FLOOR I RESPECT WHAT HAPPENS ON THE FIRST FLOOR BUT I THINK WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE [inaudible] TRY MAYBE. BEFORE WE GO ON IF YOU DON'T MIND. SO. HE'S ALWAYS HEAR PEOPLE TALK ABOUT BREAKING DOWN SILOS AND I USED TO REALLY NOT UNDERSTAND THAT AND THOUGHT IT MADE NO SENSE UNTIL I GOT THIS JOB. AND IT IS SHOCKING HOW PEOPLE WORK IN SILOS AND TO THE CHAIR'S POINT WE WE DON'T COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER THEN WE GET LEFT WONDERING WHAT'S HAPPENING -- I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF ALL OF YOU ALWAYS KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING BUT TO RICHARD'S POINT OF EXCUSE ME CENTER RAS POINT. ABOUT THEM IF COMMUTING COLLEGES COMING TO US AND WONDERING YOU KNOW HOW MUCH HOW DO I GET ON THE LIST WHY AM I NOT ON THE LIST. THE EXAMPLE THAT YOU GAVE IT IS INCREDIBLE I MEAN WE JUST I THINK I WOULD JUST SAY COMMUNICATE COMMUNICATE COMMUNICATE EVERYONE EVEN IF YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE SOMEBODY BAD NEWS. AS LONG AS YOU TELL THEM WHAT'S GOING ON AND THEY UNDERSTAND IT'S BETTER THAN NO NEWS OR THE WRONG NEWS SO JUST LET'S LET'S BREAK DOWN THOSE SILOS AND TALK TO EACH OTHER. THANK YOU SIR LIVES SO IF IF UP A PROJECT IS IS. IS NOT COMES OUT OF YOUR ON YOUR LIST FINANCE YOU APPLY YOUR CRITERIA AND THE PROJECT DOESN'T MAKE THE LIST FOR A PARTICULAR YEAR. WHEN WE TURN TO THE NEXT ROUND OF BOND FINANCING AND PROJECTS THE NEXT YEAR? TO THOSE PROJECTS STAY ON THE LIST AND ARE THEY RECONSIDERED AND AND DO THEY BUMP UP ON THE ON THE ON THE LISTER DO WE START WITH A CLEAN SLATE AND EVERYBODY GOES BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARDS AND YOU MAY OR MAY NOT MAKE IT. WE'VE BEEN RE SUBMITTING PROJECTS POPS OF PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN ON OUR APPROVED LISTS THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OUR PRACTICES BEEN -- TO TO RESUBMIT PROJECTS ARE THEIR CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THOSE PROJECTS MIGHT DROP OFF THE LIST AND IN IN IN. IN WHAT WOULD THOSE CONDITIONS BE IT SO TO THE EXTENT THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEED NO LONGER EXISTS BUT IF IF THAT IS A VERY LIMITED -- SET OF PROJECTS SO IT IS OUR PRACTICE IN GENERAL WOULD BE TO RESUBMIT. TEN MAYBE I'M JUST I THINK THAT YOUR POINT -- TO BOTH OF THE POINTS -- I THINK THERE ARE SOME CRITICAL QUESTIONS THAT THERE IS INSURED AGREEMENT ACROSS THE PARTIES HERE -- ABOUT. HOW WE APPROACH THIS YEAR TO YEAR I THINK THE CORE ONE ONE CORE ONE IS HOW MUCH MONEY? ARE WE GOING TO SPEND IN A GIVEN YEAR -- SEARCH YOUR POINT ARE WE SPENDING ALL TWO BILLION AND PROP -- PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE FUNDS ARE WE SPOT APPORTIONING IT OUT OVER SOME PERIOD OF YEARS I THINK THERE IS WE'VE HAD WE HAD SOME PLANS INITIALLY. THE SUSPENDED OVER A FORTY FIVE YEAR PERIOD THAT'S OBVIOUSLY DIFFERENT ON THE GOVERNOR'S EIGHT TO NINE YEARS AND SO. I THINK THAT'S A KEY QUESTION THAT AFFECTS HOW WE WHAT WE TELL COMMUNITY COLLEGES I THINK THAT THE OTHER QUESTION IS. ONCE YOU DECIDE ON THAT POT HOW MUCH HOW DO YOU PRIORITIZE PROJECTS WITHIN THAT POT. BUT I WILL SAY YOU KNOW I THINK WE SHARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE IS RAISED THAT A FIRE LIFE SAFETY -- CRITERIA CREATES -- CONCERNING INCENTIVESWHEN MOST OF THE MONEY IS LOCAL SO WHAT ARE YOU SPENDING YOUR LOCAL MONEY ON ND AND WHAT INCENTIVES THAT IS A CREATE -- TO TO MAKE SURE YOUR FACILITY IS -- SUFFICIENTLY -- CONCERNING -- TO TO RECEIVE STATE FUNDS HOW TO YOUR POINT ABOUT KIND OF JUST THIS QUESTION OF WHAT WE TELLING COLLEGES SO. TO GROSSLY OVERSIMPLIFY THIS PROCESS -- YOU KNOW WE MAY SEND TWO PROJECTS TO THE GOVERNOR ON TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BECAUSE WE THOUGHT THEY WERE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS SOME ROLLING. OUT BOTH COLLEGES HAVE SIGNIFICANT ENROLLMENT GROWTH LET'S SAY EQUAL ENROLLMENT GROWTH BOTH NEEDED NEW CLASSROOM FACILITIES -- I THINK IN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT AND SHOULD KIND OF WAY AND BUT YOU KNOW THAT WHEN THEY GET TO FINANCE THE ENROLLMENT GROWTH PLANS GOES AWAY. AND MEDIA OUT LIFE FIRE LIFE SAFETY ONCE THAT BEGINS TO GET APPLIED. AND SO THIS PROJECT THAT WE SENT BECAUSE WE THOUGHT IT WAS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR ENROLLMENT GROWTH. ACTUALLY MIGHT DROP OFF THE LIST BECAUSE ENROLLMENT GROWTH WASN'T THE LANDS AND THE OTHER PROJECT MIGHT GO FORWARD BECAUSE THAT'S THE DIFFERENT LINES FINANCE SUPPLIES. I WILL JUST CLOSE BY SAYING YOU KNOW I THINK WE ARE THE WE HAVE THE LEAST AUTHORITY IN THERE ACROSS THE PLAYERS IN THE ROOM SO. YOU KNOW I THINK IF THE DIRECTION WAS WE WANT ONLY PROJECTS THAT ADDRESS FIRE LIFE SAFETY I THINK THAT'S A CONVERSATION WEEK WE WOULD HAVE THE SYSTEM OF YOU KNOW MAYBE WE SHOULD BEGIN TO PRIORITIZE ONLY ON FIRE LIFE SAFETY. AGAIN THOUGH I THINK THOSE -- I THINK WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE INCENTIVES AND WOULD WANT TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE OLD -- BEFORE WE DID THAT WELL IT SEEMS TO ME THERE A COUPLE WAYS TO DO IT THE NEXT TIME THERE'S A BOND ISSUE WE COULD. DO WHAT WE'VE DONE IN OTHER BOND ISSUES WHICH IS I THINK WHICH IS SPECIFIED THAT CERTAIN PORTIONS OF THE BOND WE USE BOND FUNDS WILL BE USED FOR THIS AND CERTAIN PORTIONS BE USED. FOR SOMETHING ELSE KNOW THAT. THAT SORT OF ELIMINATES FLEXIBILITY. IN THE PROCESS AND I'M ONE FOR FLEXIBILITY JUST AS I'M ONE GENERAL OF ONE FOR LOCAL CONTROL WE CAN DO IT SO. I'D BE A LITTLE RELUCTANT TO DO THAT BUT YOU SEE I WOULD SEEM SEEMS TO ME THAT WE OUGHT TO COME TO SOME AGREEMENT. AS TO WHAT PORTION OF THE MONEY. OUGHT TO BE GENERAL USE FOR LIFE SAFETY ISSUES AND WHAT PORTION CAN BE USED FOR ENROLLMENT GROWTH WITHOUT LOCKING ANYBODY INTO A PARTICULAR FORMULA. AND THEN SORT OF MARCH DOWN THE ROAD WITH THAT IN MIND. OUT OF THE NIGHT OF THE TWENTY FOOT. TWENTY BILLION RIGHT. TWENTY TWO BLOOD TWO BILLION BUT THE NEEDS ARE. OKAY WELL OUT OF THE THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS HOW MUCH IS LIFE SAFETY. DO WE KNOW. WE DO YOU KNOW LET ME FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON THAT. UNDER OUR DEFINITION YEAH YEAH. ONE OKAY WELL I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR THIS MIND MY COLLEAGUES PROBABLY ONE OF MOVE ON TO OTHER THINGS INCLUDING THEIR DISTRICTS BUT YES I HAVE A QUESTION ON THE SPOT ABOUT MY DISTRICT IF I MAY. CERTAINLY THANK YOU. SO DECEMBER AND YOU KNOW VALLEY COLLEGE THE CREW TECHNICAL EDUCATION BUILDING -- IT IT'S SLATED TO RECEIVE THE MONEY TO IMPROVE IT DO THEY HAVE ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT THAT THAT MONEY MIGHT GO AWAY. AND IF NOT WHEN WILL THEY GET THE MONEY. OKAY THANK YOU CENTER LATER THANK YOU -- SO THE STANDARD YOU KNOW -- THE END AND YOU CAN RELATE THIS TO THE MEMBERS THAT THAT PROPOSAL THAT WAS SUBMITTED. IT IS ALMOST THE ARCHETYPE OF WHAT WE AT FINANCE WOULD BE WANTING TO SEE IT VERY. WELL IT WAS HARD WONDERFULLY I WAS SCARED YOU'RE GONNA SAY WE DID A REALLY BAD JOB WHILE WHILE IT IS HOME. WELL IT WAS NOT IN THE IN THE FIRE LIFE SAFETY CATEGORY -- I BELIEVE OF THE MODERNIZATION IS THE CATEGORY WAS AND IT DID IT AND THE THE THE PROPOSAL DID AN EXCELLENT JOB OF THE OF THE SCRIBING THE THE CRITICAL FIRE LIFE SAFETY NEEDS IN THE END THAT FACILITATES GUESS IF YOU VISITED IT YOU WOULD KNOW THAT THERE'S FIRE. FORTUNATELY THEY'RE SO MANY IT -- BUT IT IT WAS -- SO THAT BEING THE CASE THE THE NEXT STEP WOULD BE APPROVAL OF THE LEGISLATURE -- BUT BY THE LEGISLATURE AND AND STANDING BY TO GO FROM THERE ONCE THAT IS DONE SO JULY -- ONE WE GO INTO THE BASICALLY THE PUBLIC WORKS BOARD FACE THE CHANCES OFFICE WILL WILL THE MINUTE -- FUNDING IT GETS ENCUMBERED AND IT'S OFF AND RUNNING. AWESOME THANK YOU VERY MUCH BUT I ALSO JUST WHILE I HAVE IT ON WANTED TO SAY THAT CHRISTIAN IS PRETTY ACCURATE IN IN THAT AND ROMAN CATHOLIC POPULATION EXAMPLE -- THERE'S A LOT OF COMMUNICATION THAT WE HAVE WITH THE CHANCES OFFICE DURING OUR VALUATIONS. BUT THAT SAID THE ADMINISTRATION PERSPECTIVE IS THAT THE ENROLLMENT ISSUE SHOULD BE DEALT WITH LOCALLY THAT SINCE WE HAVE A FIXED PART OF STATE FUNDS WE SHOULD BE AT AND THAT STATE FUNDS JUST A FRACTION OF THE THE OVERALL NEED EVEN WHEN. TAKING LIKE MODERNIZATION THING -- THIS FIRE LIFE SAFETY IN THERE THAT WE FEEL THAT THE STATE FUNDS SHOULD BE ENSURING THAT THE THE STAFF STUDENTS AND FACULTY THAT ATTEND THESE COLLEGES OR SAY. I DON'T NECESSARILY DISAGREE WITH THAT I GUESS OR SOME EXCEPTIONS DEPENDING ON THE DEMOGRAPHICS AND WHAT COMMUNITIES WERE TALKING ABOUT SUMMER. MORE ABLE THAN OTHERS TO BEAR THE LOAD OF OF LOCAL MEASURES BUT BUT I I MICHAEL. MY COLLEAGUE'S QUESTION. RAISES A POINT AND THAT IS HOW DO WE COMMUNICATE TO TWO DISTRICTS AROUND THE STATE. WHAT GOOD PROPOSALS ARE? WHAT WE'RE REALLY LOOKING FOR IN TERMS OF? THE PROPOSED THE KIND OF PROPOSALS THAT FLOAT TO THE TOP AND AND RECEIVE APPROVAL -- AM I MAKING SENSE DO WE DO YOU COMMUNICATE BECAUSE YOU HAVE DISTRICTS OF VARYING SIZES AND I'M SURE SOME HAVE FLEETS OF PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND. HOW THIS PROCESS WORKS AND SOME PROBABLY DON'T? AND EVERYBODY SHOULD YOU KNOW COME TO THE TABLE WITH AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY SO. YET IF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM THE SYSTEM OFFICE DOESN'T. DOESN'T REALLY HAVE A GRASP OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THEN YOU'RE GOING TO BE UNABLE. TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES WITH THE COMMUNITY THE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN OF THEM THAT WE HAVE AROUND. FIFTEEN SKEWS ME ONLINE RIGHT -- HOPEFULLY THEY DON'T HAVE ANY. LIFE SAFETY AND MAINTENANCE NEEDS JUST YET. I DON'T THINK SO WE'LL HERE SOON -- I I WOULD JUST SAY YOU KNOW I THINK -- YOU KNOW OUR EMPHASIS WE HAVE A STAFF OF THAT WORKS ON WITH THE DEPARTMENT FINANCING CAPITAL OUTLAY REQUEST AFTER WE RUN THROUGH OUR PROCESS AGAIN WHICH WE THINK -- YOU KNOW TRIES TO AS OBJECTIVELY USING STATED CRITERIA -- DETERMINE THE HIGHEST PRIORITIES YOU KNOW WE ARE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO MAKE THE CASE FOR THOSE PROJECTS AND HOPEFULLY -- WRITING SUFFICIENTLY COMPELLING -- BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS TO GET THOSE PROJECTS FUNDED. AND SO WE ARE -- WE PLAY A ROLE WITH THE DISTRICT AND PREPARING THE REQUEST FOR FINANCE. SO FOR THOSE DISTRICTS THAT HAVE CONTACTED ME AND THINK THEY WERE DROPPED FROM THE LIST AND WERE RESUBMITTED AND ALL THE REST I'LL -- HAVE THEM WORK WITH YOU ALL TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED. YES. PERFECT ONE FINAL QUESTION ON THIS BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ISSUE AND THAT'S THE THAT'S THE FUTURE ACTION PEAS. AND YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THE ANALYSIS TALKS ABOUT -- VISION FOR SUCCESS LOW INCOME ENGLISH ESL STUDENTS THE CARD SERVICES SERVICE CENTER -- OBVIOUSLY. A VERY VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE EDUCATION. THERE ARE COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN THE STATE THAT ARE LOCATED IN AREAS THAT ARE NOT QUITE OF DEMO GOOD DEMOGRAPHICALLY CHALLENGED. DOES THAT MEAN THAT THEY WILL BE THAT THOSE DISTRICTS WILL BE DISADVANTAGED WHEN IT COMES. TO THIS -- BOND FINANCE THE MAINTENANCE IMPROVEMENT. PEACE SO I WOULD JUST I WOULD. OPEN BY SAYING WE ARE -- EARLY IN OUR PROCESS WE CERTAINLY NEED TO SEEK MORE CONSULTATION FROM THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH A WORKER PRIMARILY OF CHIEF BUSINESS OFFICIALS. AND FACILITIES DIRECTORS ON ALTERNATIVES -- I THINK IT FITS INTO THIS CONVERSATION BY SAYING OF THE THIRTY BILLION WE EXPECT. MUCH OF IT MOST OF IT WILL BE FUNDED LOCALLY. WE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE STATE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE LIMITED AND SO HOW DO WE BEST PRIORITIZE -- THE PROJECTS THAT -- THAT CAN BE FUNDED WITH STATE FUNDS TO YOUR EARLIER POINT COMMUNITIES HAVE DIFFERENT ABILITY TO RAISE LOCAL FUNDS AND SO WE THINK ABOUT IT -- THAT IT WOULD BE REASONABLE TO CONSIDER THAT COMMUNITIES -- THE PROPERTY TAX BASE IS A WAY OF THINKING ABOUT WHAT CAN BE GENERATED LOCALLY. AND WE THINK THE CASE HAS LONG BEEN MADE WE'VE MADE THE CASE THAT FACILITIES ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF IMPROVING STUDENT SUCCESS SO THAT WE SHOULD THINK OF IT AS A KEY LEVER. AS WE THINK ABOUT OUR GOAL TO BUY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE CLOSE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS ACROSS REGIONS ACROSS -- PARTICULARLY -- HISTORICALLY DISADVANTAGED GROUPS SO I THOUGHT YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE OF SCENTED AS AN ALTERNATIVE AS ONE IDEA FOR THE SYSTEM. IS BEGINNING TO INCORPORATE MEASURES OF NEED -- AND THEN ALSO BEGINNING TO THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE RE FRAME OUR CATEGORY SO THAT DISTRICTS ARE FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN -- WHETHER A FACILITY IS -- COMPETES AS AN INSTRUCTIONAL FACILITY OR AS A SUPPORT FACILITY TODAY UNDER GOTTA PATHWAYS MORE AND MORE OF OUR FACILITIES HAVE INTEGRATED PURPOSES AND WE THINK THAT MAKES SENSE -- TO FURTHER -- THE VISION FOR SUCCESS SO -- I THINK THESE WILL BUILD ON THESE WILL BE INCREMENTAL CHANGES TO THE EXISTING WAY IN WHICH WE ALLOCATE FACILITIES DOLLARS PRIOR TEST FACILITIES DOLLARS BUT CERTAINLY -- YOU KNOW IF YOU ALL WERE THE GOVERNOR GONNA USE DIFFERENT CRITERIA THAT I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE SURE TO HAVE THAT. CONVERSATION WITH YOU SO WE ARE PERPETUATING -- THIS INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN WHAT WE PROPOSE AND WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION LEGISLATURE INCLUDED THE BUDGET WELL I THINK I'LL BE LOOKING TO YOU. THE FOLKS AT THIS TABLE TO PROVIDE SOME SUGGESTIONS IN THAT REGARD I MEAN. YOU ARE CERTAINLY THE EXPERTS AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE CERTAINLY HAS A VARIETY OF THINGS ON THE PLATE THAT OF FINANCE HAS TO BALANCE INCLUDING DEBT SERVICE AND ALL THE REST BUT YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE ON THIS NEW TIS FUTURE ACTION BUSINESS I MEAN. PERHAPS HARDSHIP PERHAPS FAILURE TO PASS INABILITY TO PASS LOCAL BOND MEASURES. ARE OUR CRITERIA THAT DID YOU MAY WANT TO LOOK AT AND AND THE REASONS THAT BOND MEASURES DIDN'T PASS -- BECAUSE YOU KNOW AT THE END OF THE DAY WE STILL HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO EDUCATE. TO BOTH THE YOUNG AND THE NOT SO YOUNG AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE IS OFTEN THE PLACE TO DO IT. OKAY YOU FOR THE QUESTION ALSO -- THERE'S NOTHING FURTHER THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH ON ISSUE NUMBER. FOUR ISSUE NUMBER ONE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING. MORNING I THINK IT'S STILL MORNING. IF YOU -- LADIES WOULD IDENTIFY YOURSELVES DURING MY LEFT YOU'RE RIGHT MA'AM. SEAN KNEW AND WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHEN THANKS FOR JOINING US. RIGHT SO IT WOULD BE SO WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THANK YOU OKAY WHO WANTS TO START STUDENT CENTER FUNDING. START YES MA'AM. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET CONTINUES TO IMPLEMENT THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BUDGET I IN ADDITION TO ALLOCATING FUNDS BASED ON ENROLLMENT THE FORMULA ALLOCATES GENERAL PURPOSE APPORTIONMENT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES BASED ON ADDITIONAL FACTORS SUCH AS THE NUMBER OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS ENROLLED. AND SPECIFIED STUDENT SUCCESS METRICS SUCH AS THE COMPLETION OF A DEGREE OR CERTIFICATE. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN APPROXIMATELY 70% OF THE FUNDING IS DISTRIBUTED ON TOTAL ENROLLMENT. 20% ON ENROLLMENT OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS. AND 10% FOR STUDENT SUCCESS METRICS. THIS IS THE FIRST YEAR OF IMPLEMENTATION FOR THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES SOME REVISIONS TO THE IMPLEMENTATION. OF THE FORMULA SPECIFICALLY. ONE MAINTAINING TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN RATES FOR THE FORMULA INTO THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY FISCAL YEAR. TWO CAPPING YEAR OVER YEAR GROWTH FOR THE STUDENT SUCCESS ALLOCATION AT 10%. AND THREE CLARIFYING THAT THE DEFINITION OF TRANSFERS SHOULD REFLECT AN UNDUE BLOCKADED COUNT. THESE REVISIONS WERE PROPOSED TO ADDRESS ISSUES REGARDING ANOMALIES IN THE DATA FOR THE STUDENT SUCCESS AND SUPPLEMENTAL ALLOCATIONS. THIS PROPOSAL IS ALSO INTENDED TO GIVE SUFFICIENT TIME TO ADDRESS THE FORMULAS LONG TERM FISCAL STABILITY. AND IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF DATA REPORTED BY DISTRICTS. GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO PROVIDES PROVIDES ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR ABORTION MINTS INCLUDING. TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS PROPOSITION NINETY GENERAL FUND FOR ENROLLMENT GROWTH OF POINT AND TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT MILLION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND FOR A THREE POINT THANK YOU AND HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS [inaudible] HELLO. BOTH THE AWAY -- AND HAD A HAND ALL PUFFED UP IT'LL USE WITH KIND OF A SUBSET OF SOME OF INFORMATION WITHIN YOUR AGENDA -- USE -- AS THE BASIS FOR MY PRESENTATION BUT ACTUALLY I'LL SKIP OVER TO PAGE THREE ON OUR HAND OUT TO DISCUSS -- I'M LIKE TO DISCUSS TWO ISSUES HERE -- WE DON'T HAVE WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THE COMPONENTS THE ENROLLMENT GROWTH FUNDING IN THE IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WE'LL HAVE NO CONCERNS WITH THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT. WANT TO TALK ABOUT -- TWO THINGS ONE IS -- ON AN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN APPORTIONMENT SHORTFALL -- FOR THIS YEAR -- AND THEN I'LL TALK ABOUT SOME OF OUR ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING SOME MODIFICATIONS TO THE FUNDING FORMULA. ON THE FIRST ARM IN ARM UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ON THEIR RESPECTIVE SHORTFALL -- FOR PERFORMANCE IN -- IN THE CURRENT YEAR OF ESTIMATE IS SIXTY NINE MILLION SO THERE'S THERE'S NOT ENOUGH GENERAL FUND -- TO COVER THE FULL COST OF THE FUNDING FORMULA. AND THIS IS DRIVEN BY -- AND HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED -- COSTS REGARDING THE STUDENTS ACROSS ALL OCCASION WHICH IS THE PORTION OF THE FORMULA BASED ON STUDENT OUTCOMES -- AND AND THIS THIS -- INCREASE I THINK IT'S PARTLY WHAT'S DRIVEN AND MANY OF THE PROPOSALS TO TRY T CAP -- FUNDING AND TO LOOK AT THE DATA AND RELIABILITY OF THAT OF THAT DATA. THAT THE CHANCES OFFICE HAS AN AN ESTIMATE OF THE SHORTFALL THAT'S EVEN HIGHER THAT'S BASED ON THERE A PRELIMINARY WITH I'M LOOKING AT DATA AS OF THE END OF FEBRUARY -- THEIR FORMULA FUNDING FROM THE COSTS ARE EVEN HIGHER IT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE MILLION ABOVE WITH THOSE IN THE BUDGET. AND THEN THEY ALSO PROJECT -- LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED PROPERTY TAX REVENUES. I'M I THINK WE WE WE WERE JUST POINT OUT ONE I THINK IN TERMS OF THE LOCAL PROPERTY TAX REVENUE WE WOULD SAY THAT -- THE THE DATA THAT WE COLLECT THAT HE WANTED THIS PART OF THE YEAR IS CONSISTENTLY UNDER REPORTED DISTRICTS -- BOTH SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT ND TO UNDER REPORT FROM SPECIFIC REVENUES -- REDEVELOPMENT REVENUES AT YOU RIGHT FROM THE NEWS AND SO WE WOULD EXPECT THAT THAT'S NOT AS MUCH OF AN ISSUE -- WHEN YOU GET TO MAIN YOU GET UPDATED INFORMATION? BUT THE THE HIGHER COSTS OF THE FUNDING FORMULA THE TEXAS OFFICES USING THEM THE THE LATEST AVAILABLE DATA WE THINK THAT'S AN ACCURATE REFLECTION OF OF A SHORTFALL YOU'LL HAVE IN IN THE CURRENT YEAR. THAT'S THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION. I AM WHAT WE THINK OF THE THREE IN A MILLION ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE MILLION IS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT THAT IS HIGHER COSTS OF THE FORMULA. THAT WE THINK IS A REAL SHORTFALL YOU HAVE WHETHER IT'S MORE TO THREE HUNDRED MILLION WE THINK IT DEPENDS ON WHETHER THE PROPERTY TAX ISSUE IS REALLY -- JUST THE UNDER REPORTING OF ONE POINT IN TIME OR WHETHER IT'S REALLY IN A SYSTEMIC ISSUE. WITHIN THE HUNDRED FORTY THREE SERVE A MINIMUM THAT YOU SHOULD EXPECT THAT THAT WILL BE USEFUL. FOR JUST A COUPLE A COUPLE COMMENTS IN TERMS OF YOUR CONSIDERATION WE KNOW THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS INDICATING THAT THEY WILL WAIT TILL MADE TO FEEL REVENUES ARE BEFORE THEY DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT. THEY WILL BACK FILL -- THE SHORTFALL. I'M. SORRY IT MIGHT BE ONE OF THE BIG DECISIONS YOU HAVE WHEN YOU GET -- TO YOUR YOUR BUDGET BECAUSE THAT IS WHETHER OR NOT YOU WANT TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO BACK FILL. I'M COVERING THE SHORTFALL DOES HELP SGNAL SUPPORT FOR THE NEW FUNDING FORMULA AND THE FOCUS ON IMPROVING STUDENT OUTCOMES IN THE COMMITTEE CALL SYSTEM -- BUT IF THE LEGISLATURE CHOSE NOT TO COVER THE SHORTFALL THERE WILL BE -- SOME ADJUSTMENT TO COMMUTE COLLEGE AMOUNT OF OF FUNDING FORMULA AMOUNT THAT THE RECEIVED YEAR. AND THAT THE CHANCES OF AS INDICATED THEY WOULD -- TRY TO ASSURE THAT EVERY DISTRICT GOT AT LEAST WHAT THEY GOT LAST YEAR PLUS COLA WHICH IS ALSO -- TIED TO WITH A HOLD HARMLESS PROVISION THAT THAT WAS INCLUDED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET AS WE TRANSITION TO THE FORMULA. COLLEGES ARE -- DISTRICTS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE RECEIVING AT THE BARE MINIMUM A SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN PLUS COLA FOR THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF PERIOD. I'M READING THAT SORT OF DIFFERENT THAT APPROACH -- FROM A PROJECT THAT THE FEW REASONABLE GIVEN THAT THERE ARE SOME DISTRICTS -- MY WHOLE ARE RECEIVING FOR EXAMPLE DOUBLE DIGIT INCREASES UNDER THE NEW FORMULA. THOSE DISTRICTS MIGHT BE MORE EASILY ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE SOME OF THESE OPERATIONS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE YEAR BECAUSE MANY OF THEM DIDN'T KNOW THAT THEY WERE GETTING. FUNDING WITH HIGH BECAUSE ALL OF THE THE THE THE LAST THE LAST MINUTE CHANGES THERE ARE A LOT LIKE MACHINES THE FORMULA IT IS VERY DIFFERENT TO WHAT LOOKED LIKE IN JANUARY. AND SO WE DON'T THINK A LOT OF COLLEGES REALLY EXPECTED THE M. AND BUDGETED FOR THE THINGS THAT MIGHT BE MORE EASY EASIER FOR THEM TO ACCOMMODATE. I'M. THAT I WANT TO MOVE ON INTO THE OURS OF MEN OF FIVE THE PROPOSALS TO YOU -- CHANGE THE THE ACTUAL FORMULA ITSELF IN A MOVE TO PAGE. FIVE SO ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS WE DID WHEN WE HEARD OF THE PROPOSAL AND WE KNEW THAT IT WAS COMING FROM SOME CONCERNS ABOUT -- THE ISSUES WITH THE DATA AS IT -- AND AND YOU KNOW THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET IS USING -- WE'RE USING ONE YEAR DATA IN A REHEARSAL USING SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN OUTCOMES DATA TO DECIDE HOW MUCH EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FUNDING -- DISTRICTS WILL RECEIVE THAT DATA CAME IN HIGHER THAN EXPECTED AND A BATTERY SOME CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER THE STATE OUT THERE SOME ISSUES WITH THE DATA. SO WE WANTED TO LOOK BACK AND SAY IT SO IS THIS SOMETHING NEW IS THIS SOMETHING THAT'S JUST STARTED TO HAPPEN BECAUSE OF THE NEW FUNDING FORMULA OR IS THIS SOMETHING THAT IS SORT OF A INHERENT -- COMPONENT OF THE DATA SO THIS CHART THAT WE HAVE YOU ON PAGE FIVE SHOWS YOU THAT WE WENT BACK TEN YEARS AND LOOK THAT. THIS IS -- SPECIFICALLY ASSOCIATE DEGREES THOUGH WE IF WE DID THE CHART FOR CERTIFICATE THAT WOULD LOOK ALMOST IT WOULD LOOK VERY SIMILAR. JUST LOOKING AT WHAT ARE THE YEAR TO YEAR FLUCTUATIONS IN IN IN THESE AWARDS PER YEAR. AS YOU CAN SEE ON WE HAVE ONE LINE OF THE STATEWIDE LINE THAT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE STABLE THAN THE OTHERS BUT STILL CAN VERY ANYWHERE FROM. FROM 0% INCREASE 213% INCREASE PER YEAR. AND THEN WHEN YOU GO TO INDIVIDUAL DISTRICTS WE CHOSE THREE RANDOM DISTRICT OF A BIGGER FOR SMALL AND MEDIUM JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA. YOU CAN SEE PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL FLUCTUATION FROM YEAR TO YEAR IN TERMS OF THE THE THE OUTCOME SO. THIS DOES RAISE ISSUES OF IF THIS IS THE THE THE WAY WE'RE DISTRIBUTING FUNDING TO DISTRICTS. DO WE WANT TO CREATE THE UNCERTAINTY BOTH FOR THE STATE IN TERMS OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT COSTS ARE BUT THEN ALSO FOR DISTRICT THEMSELVES DISTRICTS ART -- FROM THE INTENT OF THE NEW FUNDING FROM THE WAS TO CREATE GREATER INSTABILITY AND AND PREDICTABILITY IN FUNDING. OR DO KILL WEEDS WHAT WHAT CAUSES THIS THESE WIVES WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WE DO SO WE DID TALK TO A FEW -- DISTRICTS TO GET A FENCE AND WE DON'T THINK WE CAN POINT PINPOINT WHAT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE IN TERMS OF WEIGHT. BUT THEY WERE KIND OF THREE CATEGORIES OF OF REASONS WHY THIS THIS COULD BE THE CASE ONE IS THE DATE OF NOT ACCURATE -- BEFORE THE FUNDING FORMULA WAS ADOPTED THIS WAS SIMPLY LOW STAKES THE THAT'S NOT AUDITED BY AN EXTERNAL ENTITY OR WAS IT USED FOR ANY. FUNDING DECISION SO IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF SCRUTINY ON SIR COULD BE THAT THEY'RE JUST THE DATA IS JUST NOT AN ACTOR HISTORICALLY. IT COULD ALSO HAVE WE CHANGE THAT NOW. I THINK THE CHANCES OF IT ISN'T IS IS GOING TO INCLUDE OUR THERE WILL BE AUDIT THEIR ANNUAL FINANCIAL AUDITS THE DISTRICTS MUST DO I MOVING FORWARD BEGINNING IN NINETEEN TWENTY MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE WILL BE AN AUDIT. THAT DEBT THIS DATA WILL BE AUDITED OF PART OF THAT SO THAT SHOULD HELP ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS WELL. UNLESS THE AUDIT. REFLECTS THAT THE DATA IS ACCURATE AND WE HAVE THESE WIDE SWINGS AND THEN SO MY QUESTION MY FOLLOW UP QUESTION IS THAT I GUESS IT PROBABLY SHOULDN'T GO TO YOU BUT I'LL. YOU FREAKING SO OUR ADDRESS YEAH. WHAT ADDITIONAL DATA POINTS WHAT ADDITIONAL IT'S I THINK THE CHANCELLOR'S ALSO HIRED A FIGMENT TO DO A REVIEW THIS SPRING OF OF OF A RANDOM SAMPLE OF DISTRICT AND ALL LET THEM TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT MORE LATER? BUT YOU ARE ALSO HELPING SET UP MY POINTS THAT I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT WHAT IS THE BEST YES IS THAT IS SUCH THAT YOU. I APPRECIATE THAT. SO THERE ARE A COUPLE OTHER THINGS THAT WE HEARD FROM COLLEGES ARE POSSIBLE REASONS ONE IS JUST SOMETIMES THERE'S LAGS INWINDOWS REPORTED SO FOR EXAMPLE -- IT MIGHT BE THAT TYPICALLY A DISTRICT IS PROCESSING THEIR ASSOCIATE DEGREES IN MAY AND JUNE OF A FISCAL YEAR. AND WHEN YOU'RE FOR WHATEVER REASON THERE'S A LAG THEY DON'T GET TO THEM UNTIL JULY AND AUGUST. THE MONTH OR TWO MONTH DELAY MAYBE FOR A STUDENT DOESN'T MEAN MUCH. FOR THE PROGRAM DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING BUT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE INTO THE DATA IT LOOKS LIKE YOU DROP ONE YEAR AND THEN YOU CAME BACK UP ANOTHER. SO IT COULD BE THAT THERE ARE SOME OF THESE ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES THAT ARE MAKING THE STATE A LOOK THE WAY IT IS. AND THEN THE OTHER ISSUE IS THAT SOMETIMES ARE JUST LOCAL DIFFERENCES IN WHAT'S GOING ON SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU MIGHT IMAGINE. YOU'RE IN A COLLEGE IN A IN AN AREA THAT'S HAD IMPROVEMENTS OR OR PROBLEMS IN THEIR RECORD AND ECONOMICALLY AND THAT MIGHT AFFECT THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS TO ENTER THE SYSTEM SO YOU MIGHT HAVE A BIGGER COHORT OF STUDENTS WHEN YOU'RE. IN A SMALLER COVER DISTANT THE NEXT THAT MIGHT AFFECT HOW WHAT YOU SEE AS AL COMES DOWN THE ROAD. YOU ALSO COULD IMAGINE THAT IF I FOR EXAMPLE CS YOU MIGHT CHANGE ITS POLICIES ON TRANSFERS MIGHT DECIDE THAT THEY'RE GOING. TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF TRANSFER STUDENTS THAT THEY ADMIT. THAT'S GOING TO THEM THAT MIGHT RESULT IN NEIGHBORING COLLEGES HAVING TRANSFER NUMBERS GO UP THESE ARE ISSUES THESE ARE REAL CHANGES AND SO IT'S IT'S FLUCTUATING BUT IT'S BASED ON WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING OUT IN THE IN THE IN THE WORLD. WELL YEAH I WOULD BET THAT IF IT'S IF IT'S BUREAUCRATIC -- UNCERTAINTY OR LACK OF SPEED THE MONEY FLOW WILL PROBABLY TEND TO SPEED THAT UP YEAH THAT COULD BE ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT I THINK THAT POTENTIALLY COULD BE IT COULD BE A WAY TO ADDRESS THAT I'M. SO OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ON WE HAVE TWO RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE TH SHE WON RELATED TO THIS POSITION WE DO THINK THAT THE THE STEPS TO THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IS TAKING -- TOO INCLUDE AUDIT GUIDELINES AROUND THIS DATA AND TRAFFIC NOT TO REVIEW AND MAKE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOW THE PROCESS CAN IMPROVE WILL IMPROVE THE DATA ACCURACY I THINK IT WILL HELP US FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE AT THE DATA WE'RE GETTING IS. WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING IN THE FIELD BUT WE DON'T KNOW THAT THAT NECESSARILY WILL DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT DETECT THE STATE A COMPLEX RATE AND SO WHAT WE RECOMMEND IS THAT THE DISTANCE OF VALIDATION BECAUSE CREATED USING A THREE YEAR ROLLING AVERAGE AS OPPOSED TO WHEN YOU'RE OUT OF TIME. SO THAT THAT PROVIDES A LITTLE BIT OF A SMOOTHING EFFECT SO YOU DON'T HAVE THESE WILD SWINGS UP AND DOWN. OR EVEN IF YOU DO FROM YEAR TO YEAR THAT IT'S NOT REFLECTED IN THE AMOUNTS THAT WERE IS DISTURBING TO DISTRICTS. THE THE NEXT RECOMMENDATION THAT WE HAVE IS THAT YOU RELATED TO THE CAP SO WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THE PROPOSAL TO CAP THE THE THE STUDENTS ACROSS ALLOCATION AT 10% GROWTH PER YEAR. OUR CONCERN THERE IS THAT THERE ARE SOME DISTRICTS THAT MIGHT BE GROWING AT THAT RATE BECAUSE THEY'RE ACTUALLY MAKING GENUINE IMPROVEMENT THAT WE DON'T WANT. TO DISCOURAGE THAT -- SO WHAT WE RECOMMEND IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE EXPLORE OTHER ALTERNATIVES FOR COST CONTAINMENT THAT THAT -- WOULD NOT NECESSARILY REMOVE THE STRONG INCENTIVE FOR SOME DISTRICTS SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS APPROACHES YOU COULD TAKE THEIR ONE SPECIFIC THING THAT WE RECOMMEND IS -- LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF OUTCOMES BASED FUNDING THAT'S GENERATED BY ANY INDIVIDUAL STUDENT IN ANY PARTICULAR YEAR TO THE HIGHEST DEGREE EARNED SUFFER OR THE HIGHEST ORDERED SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU EARNED. TWO ASSOCIATES DEGREES IN A CERTIFICATE IN A YEAR WE WOULD JUST GIVE YOU FUNDING FOR ONE OF THE ASSOCIATE DEGREES I MEAN THE IDEA THERE IS THAT WE DON'T WANT COLLEGES TO TO JUST START SORT OF FINDING STUDENTS WE KNOW ALREADY GONNA GET TO THE SYSTEM AND JUST FINDING NEW CERTIFICATE THE NEW DEGREES TO ADD. TO IT TO INCREASE FUNDING THAT'S NOT KIND OF THE INTENT OF THE FORMULA WE WANT TO BE REWARDING -- DISTRICTS THAT ARE GETTING MORE STUDENTS TO COMPLETE WITH WITH EITHER A DEGREE OR CERTIFICATE SO WE THINK THIS WOULD HELP REDUCE BECAUSE IN A WAY THAT STILL ENCOURAGES STUDENT ODD COLLEGES TO INCREASED IN THREE TH -- TO THOSE OF THE TWO RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE HAVE AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER THE QUESTION. TOO MANY COLLEGES OF LIKE TO INTERESTED IN YOUR COMMENT ON THE LA AS RECOMMENDATIONS AND AND ALSO WHEN WILL WE HAVE DATA. THAT IS ACCURATE. ON WHICH TO BASE SOME FINAL DECISIONS ON WHAT THE FINAL VERSION OF THIS. STUDENT SUCCESS FUNDING PLAN LOOKS LIKE HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE. TO COLLECT DATA TO DETERMINE. HOWARD WHAT WHAT'S GOING ON AND WHO WERE GONNA HURT BY DOING WHAT WE DO AND SO WE HAVE DATA TODAY WE FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WE'RE USING THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN OF THE STATUTE SAYS TO YOU SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN CAL'S OF BOTH THE LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND WHAT WE'RE CALLING THE SUPPLEMENTAL. ALLOCATION AND THEN THE OUTCOMES AND THE STUDENTS XSL CATION I THINK THE CONCERN THAT'S BEEN RAISED IN THE BUDGET IS -- THAT DATA. SUBMITTED AS PART OF OUR NORMAL -- ANNUAL REPORTING PROCESS SEES NOW HAS A NEW LEVEL OF SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT IT DIDN'T BEFORE AND IS THAT DATA -- ACCURATE AND SO I THINK WHAT WERE SO WE'VE SAID IS THAT'S AN IMPORTANT QUESTION THE ANSWER WE ASKED THE FISCAL CRISIS MANAGEMENT ASSISTANT ASSISTANCE TEAM TO PRODUCE A REPORT TO DO A REVIEW OF A SAMPLE OF DISTRICTS -- INTO PRODUCER REPORT FOR US AND SO WE'LL HAVE THAT REPORT IN EARLY MAY THAT -- HOPEFULLY CAN INFORM OUR FINAL DELIBERATIONS -- TO THE DISTRICTS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SUBMIT. TO CORRECTED DATA WE HAVE -- WE HAVE WE GAVE DISTRICTS THE OPPORTUNITY THIS YEAR TO SUBMIT A CORRECTED DATA -- FOR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN MOVING FORWARD -- PART OF THAT FAKE MAD -- CHARGES TO COME UP WITH SOME PROTOCOLS THAT WE SHOULD PUT IN PLACE I WOULD EXPECT THAT ISSUES -- LIKE THAT. OKAY AND THEN WE HAVE THE THREE YEAR ROLLING AVERAGE ISSUE AND THEN WE HAVE THE WHAT I WILL CALL THE LABELING ON OF ASSOCIATE DEGREES AND CERTIFICATES AS PART OF THE FUNDING MECHANISM. THOUGHT SHOULD I WALK THROUGH I CAN WALK THROUGH -- AND AND I THINK I MAY ADDRESS SOME OF IT THOUGH I WILL BE SAYING IT. I ALSO THINK -- THESE SAME THINGS OTHERS HAVE SAID IN DIFFERENT WAYS SO I WILL DO THAT QUICKLY BUT I'M WORKING THROUGH THIS PACKET -- AND I'M STARTING ON PAGE. TWO THE PART THAT I JUST -- YES -- THE PART THAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE COVER IS THAT -- YOU KNOW WHAT WHY DID WE DO THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE AND I THINK WE AS THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAD THREE GOALS ONE TO ENCOURAGE PROGRESS TOWARDS THE VISION FOR SUCCESS. ESPECIALLY CLOSING ACHIEVEMENT GAPS -- FOR THOSE GROUPS WHO HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY MARGINALIZED A SECOND TO VERY EXPLICITLY PROVIDE DISTRICTS SERVING HIGHER NUMBERS OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING. AND THEN THIRD TO MAKE BEANS -- DISTRICTS TO MAKE FUNDING TO DISTRICTS. MOST USEFUL BEST ABLE TO SUPPORT THAT -- IMPROVEMENTS TO ASTON SUCCESS BY MAKING THEM STABLE PREDICTABLE AND FLEXIBLE. AND SO THE YOU KNOW THE PART OF THIS AND I'M GOING TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SLIDE OF PAGE. TWO IS THAT THIS IS A RELATIVELY IT IS A IN SOME WAYS VERY SIMPLE FORMULA WE ARE COUNTING THE NUMBER. OF FACTORS A VARIETY OF THINGS THAT WE ARE COUNTING. AND WE ARE NOW MULTIPLYING THEM BY A RATE THAT THE LEGISLATURE PUT INTO -- THE LAW THE RATES WERE DESIGNED SO THAT ABOUT 70% OF THE MONEY IN THE FIRST YEAR WOULD GO TO THE ENROLLMENT BASE THE BASE ALLOCATION. ABOUT A 20% WOULD GO TO THE ALLOCATION THE SUPPLEMENTAL ALLOCATION FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS ABOUT 10% FOR THE FOR THE STUDENTS XSL OCCASION -- I THINK IT'S JUST IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT YOU SET THE THE RATES OF THE STATUTE THE PROPOSAL THIS YEAR IS TO CHANGE THOSE RATES. I'M MOVING OUT OF PAGE THREE ONE OF THE THINGS -- WE HAVEN'T TALKED AS MUCH ABOUT TODAY IS THE PROVISIONS AROUND FUNDING STABILITY THAT WERE INCLUDED THESE ARE OFTEN CALLED THE HOLD HARMLESS. SO FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WHAT WE ARE. ACTUALLY APPORTIONING TO DISTRICTS IS EITHER THE AMOUNT THAT THE FORMULA CALCULATED. FOR WHAT THEY RECEIVED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN ADJUSTED BY A CHANGE IN THE COST OF LIVING. IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY WE HAD A THIRD -- PROVISION RELATED TO STABILITY THAT SAYS IF YOUR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FUNDING FORMULA CALCULATION WAS HIGHER WE WILL GIVE YOU WHAT YOU GOT -- WOULD HAVE GOTTEN IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TO PROVIDE YOUR GEAR STABILITY. AND SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE THREE WHEN WE THINK ABOUT HOW FUNDS ARE DISTRIBUTED UNDER THE NEW FUNDING FORMULA. YOU'LL SEE MOST OF THE MONEY. VERY SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE MONEY CONSISTENT WITH THE STATUTE IS GOING TO THE BASE ALLOCATION OF MORE THAN FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. ABOUT A YOU KNOW ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IS GOING TO THE SUPPLEMENTAL LOCATION LESS THAN A BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE STUDENT SUCCESS. WITH A SMALL AMOUNT IS NECESSARY TO MAKE SURE THAT DISTRICTS ARE BEING HELD HARMLESS. THE OTHER PART THAT I'M MOVING TO PAGE FOR THAT -- WE HAVEN'T TALKED AS MUCH ABOUT IS THAT -- YOU KNOW THINKING. WORKING WITH FINANCIAL INCENTIVES IS COMPLICATED -- THERE IS A POTENTIAL -- FOR YOU KNOW UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE STATUTE LAST YEAR ENACTED -- WAS A SET OF PROVISIONS THAT WERE INTENDED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE THE WORK DISTRICTS WERE DOING ON THEIR BUDGET WAS ALIGNED WITH THE GOALS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE VISION FOR SUCCESS SO THE STATUTE REQUIRES DISTRICTS TO ADOPT GOALS. THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE'S GOALS OF IMPROVING OUTCOMES IN CLOSING ACHIEVEMENT GAPS. THEN TO ALIGN THEIR LOCAL PLANS FOR HOW THEY'RE SPENDING MONEY -- WITH THOSE GOALS AND ALIGNING THEIR BUDGETS WITH THOSE PLANS SO I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE HOPING -- YOU KNOW HAPPENS MOVING FORWARD IN A PLACE WHERE OUR OFFICE NEEDS TO PLAY AS A ROLE IS SUPPORTING DISTRICTS HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW DO YOU BEST MEET THE THE INCENTIVES THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES THAT ARE CREATED IN THE FUNDING FORMULA. DOING SO IN A WAY THAT SUPPORTS THE THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING THAT THE WORD THAT YOUR STUDENTS NEED -- TO TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES. I WILL SKIP OVER -- TO PAGE FIVE THAN I DID TALK THROUGH SO I'M LOOKING AT THE SIDE THAT SAYS CONSIDERATION OF US -- FUNDING FORMULA MODIFICATIONS SCF MODIFICATIONS. AND SO TO YOUR POINT MR CHER YOU KNOW WE ARE SPENDING A LOT OF TIME WITH THE WORK GROUP -- THAT INCLUDE SYSTEM STAKEHOLDERS TO WORK THROUGH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS AND TO WORK THROUGH THE ALLEY -- ALTERNATIVES AND OTHER ALTERNATIVES THAT HAVE COME UP -- FROM OTHER SYSTEM STAKEHOLDERS. THE LIST IS IN YOUR AGENDA OF THE FULL LIST OF QUESTIONS THAT WE ARE -- CONSIDERING AND ON THIS SLIDE I'VE I'VE BROKEN THEM UP INTO TWO CATEGORIES ONE IS. KIND OF STRUCTURAL ISSUES GENERALLY -- WHAT TYPES OF CONSTRAINTS SHOULD WE PUT ALL THE FORMULA SHOULD WE PUT ON A YEAR OVER YEAR -- CAP ON THE STUDENT SUCCESS ALLOCATION I THINK WE SHARE SIMILAR CONCERNS IN THE ALLEY -- RAISED ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR CAP BUT I THINK WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE FOR THE FORMULA TO BE FINANCIALLY SUSTAINABLE THAT THERE'S LIMITS ON HOW MUCH THE COST WOULD GROW YEAR FOR YEAR. UP WE AGREED WITH THE LA THOSE CONCERNS ABOUT THE FLUCTUATION AND DATA PARTICULARLY FOR THE STUDENT SUCCESS ALLOCATION AND HOW MUCH THAT CHANGES YOUR FOR YOUR WE THINK IT'S REASONABLE. TO USE SOME TYPE OF AVERAGE OF DATA OVER MULTIPLE YEARS IT'S WHAT WE DID IN THE SPACE ALLOCATION ON THE ENROLLMENT SIDE OF THE FORMULA WHERE WE SAID. FOR A FOR A MOMENT FOR FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS WORKING ACCOUNT USING A THREE YEAR CALCULATION THAT LOOKS AT THREE YEARS OF ENROLLMENT TO DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF FUNDING -- AND THEN ON THE STUDENT SUCCESS ALLOCATION -- A CORE ISSUE THAT RE RAISED -- LAST YEAR WAS THIS KILLING OF AWARDS FIRST IS COUNTING OF STUDENTS AND SO I THINK IN GENERAL WE AGREE WITH -- YOU KNOW THE THE THE ALLEY OWES RECOMMENDATION THAT WE SHOULD BE COUNTING SOMETHING LIKE THE HIGHEST AWARD THAT A STUDENT EARNS IN A GIVEN YEAR -- IN ORDER -- TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FOCUS REMAINS ON GUIDED PATHWAYS THAT LEAD A STUDENT TO BE TO THE FOR BOB THERE ARE FEW OTHER -- ISSUES THE GOVERNOR OBVIOUSLY HAS A PROPOSAL TO KILL TRANSFER STUDENTS DIFFERENTLY TO HELP THIS TRANSFER STUDENT ONCE. IN THE DISTRICT WHERE THEY LIVE ONE OF THE CONCERNS WE'VE HAD ABOUT THAT PROPOSAL AND THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED OR STAKEHOLDER CONVERSATIONS. IS THAT ESPECIALLY -- AND URBAN AREAS STUDENTS ARE ATTENDING COMMUNITY COLLEGES -- SOMEWHERE ELSE A PLACE THEY DON'T LIVE -- AGAIN THOUGH WE RECOGNIZE THE GOVERNOR'S INTEREST IN MAKING SURE THAT THERE ARE CONSTRAINTS ON THAT PARTICULAR MEASURE. AND SO WE'RE LOOKING AT ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF OF OF FIGURING OUT HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE. CONTINUING TO ENCOURAGE THE GOAL THAT WE HAVE THAT A STUDENT SUCCESSFULLY TRANSFERS TO A FOUR YEAR INSTITUTION WHILE RECOGNIZING -- THE CONTRIBUTION IN AN ADEQUATELY -- COMPENSATING DISTRICTS FOR THE COUNTRY OCT CONTRIBUTION THEY MAKE. TO THAT OUTCOME COULD DO IS COULD THERE BE SOME WEIGHING OF FOR EXAMPLE WHERE THE STUDENT OBTAINS THE MOST CREDITS IN A PARTICULAR YEAR I MEAN. THE PROBLEM IS OF COURSE IS. SOME OF THEM ANYWAY IF NOT MANY OF THEM ARE IMPACTED AND SO IF YOU ARE FORTUNATE TO LIVE IN A PART OF THE STATE WHERE YOU HAVE FOUR FIVE OR SIX COMMUNITY COLLEGES -- YOU'RE GOING TO GO OR YOU CAN GET THE CHORUS AND YOU MAY BE. YOU MAY BE A FREEWAY FLYER FOR QUITE SOME TIME -- COLLECTING THE CREDIT YOU NEED TO MOVE TO THE SYSTEM BUT PERHAPS YOUR YOUR HOME BASES WHERE YOU. YOU KNOW YOU YOU TAKE NINE CREDITS YOUR EIGHT CREDITS IN A PARTICULAR QUARTER IN FOR SOME PLACE ELSE YOU CAME UP WITH THAT FAR FASTER THAN IT TOOK US TO COME UP ABOUT OUR HOME SO WE I THINK WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT A JOB ON US THERE WERE. NO DOUBT IT'S A IT MAKES ME REALIZE -- MANY PEOPLE COULD -- DO THIS WORK WELL SO -- WE ARE LOOKING AT THE THE PLACE WHERE THE STUDENTS TOOK THE MOST UNITS ARE THE PLACE WHERE THE STUDENT LAST ATTENDED. OR THOUGHT SOME THRESHOLD THAT SAYS WILL KILL THE STUDENT AT ANY DISTRICT WITH A STUDENT AT ATTAINED A MINIMUM NUMBER OF UNITS IN THE MOST RECENT YEAR. FOR WEIGHING DIFFERENT OPTIONS RECOGNIZING THE GOLD OF THE GOVERNOR INCLUDED IN THIS BUDGET GOOD. AND IN THE LAST -- SLIDE ON PAGE SIX AGAIN JUST TO REITERATE -- THIS DATA REVIEW NO I THINK WE SEE THE TWO ISSUES IN THE BUDGET BEING YOU KNOW HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THE FUNDING FORMULAS FINANCIALLY IS A SUSTAINABLE. AND THEN HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THAT WE HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT THE DATA IS VALID AND RELIABLE -- WE PASS THE FAKE NOT TO DO THAT REVIEW SO THE THREE THINGS THEY'RE COMING BACK TO US WITH. OUR REPORT ON WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE SYSTEM TODAY WHAT ARE THE COMMON PRACTICES WHAT OUR BEST PRACTICES THEY'VE NOTED -- HIGHLIGHTING WEAKNESSES AND MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS TO US ABOUT -- PROTOCOLS THAT WE SHOULD PUT IN PLACE POLICIES THAT WE SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTING IT AT A SYSTEM LEVEL TO ENSURE CONFIDENCE AND THEN HOW WOULD WE GO ABOUT AUDITING THESE TYPES OF DATA. AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS [inaudible] EARLIER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WHEN YOU REFER TO THE WORK GROUP IS THAT THE ADVISORY GROUP. THAT IS THE ADVISER WORKGROUP THE LIBELED MAYBE JUST SAY THERE ARE LOTS OF ENTITIES IN THE SPACE RIGHT NOW SO THE STATUTE -- IN YOUR AGENDA NOTED THE STATUTE -- CREATED AN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE A TWELVE MEMBER COMMITTEE MADE UP OF APPOINTEES OF THE GOVERNOR THE LEGISLATURE AND LEGISLATIVE LEADERS. BOB THAT GROUP HAS A VERY SPECIFIC CHARGE IN THE STATUTE HAPPY TO TALK MORE SO THAT IS NOT THE GROUP THAT'S LOOKING INTO THIS. THAT'S REALLY BAD MARKINGS OKAY SO THAT WE HAVE AN ADVISORY WORK GROUP THAT WE HAVE CHARGED WITH REVIEWING FUNDING FORMULA ISSUES AND THEN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA HAS CREATED A WORK GROUP OF A CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND TRUSTEES TO ALSO REVIEW THE FUNDING FORMULA SO THERE'S THANK. ALLAH I NEED FOR COORDINATION WE ARE WORKING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO COORDINATE ACROSS THESE ENTITIES I I AGREE WITH YOU THAT IS MY MY HOPE BECAUSE WHAT I'VE HEARD IS THAT THERE IS A LACK OF COMMUNICATION. BETWEEN THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND IF IN THE DISTRICTS AS FAR AS HOW THEY CHANGED THE FORMULA -- HOW BEST TO MAKE THE FORMULA WORK -- SO DO THE THREE GROUPS EVER TALK. WE HAVE WORK TO HAVE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN OUR OFFICE AND THE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEAGUES -- GROUP -- THE WORKGROUP OR EXCUSE ME THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE HAS HAD ONE MEETING OUR OFFICE -- OR WAS THERE AND SO WE'VE COMMUNICATED WITH THEIR STAFF -- I WOULD SAY THE THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE THOUGH VERY INTENTIONALLY IS INDEPENDENT FROM OUR OFFICE THE STATUTE -- DIRECTED US TO CONTRACT WITH A THIRD PARTY TO HAVE STAFF FOR THAT COMMITTEE SO WE ARE NOT SUPPORTING THE END OF THE DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS BY COMMITTEE. SO THE WORKING ADVISORY GROUP I WOULD JUST -- STRONGLY ENCOURAGE THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO REACH OUT TO THEM TO WORK WITH THEM -- AND THEN ADDITIONALLY I WAS WONDERING IF YOU ARE INCLUDING EMPLOYEES AND FACULTY AND ASKING THEM THEIR OPINION ON HOW THIS WORKS AND HOW TO CREATE A BETTER FORMULA. YES SO -- ON OUR ADVISORY WORK GROUP WE HAVE A VARIETY IT'S HISTORICALLY BEEN MADE UP OF CHIEF BUSINESS OFFICIALS BUT WE'VE WORKED YOU ADD OTHERS INCLUDING FACULTY TO THAT GROUP -- I WOULD SAY I THINK WE HAVE DONE IT IN A VARIETY OF WAYS. WE'VE HAD A BIT OF A ROAD SHOW GOING TO CONFERENCES BUT I I CERTAINLY HEAR THE FEEDBACK AND I THINK WE CAN DO MORE AND SO -- HAPPY -- TO IF THERE ARE SPECIFIC WAYS YOU THINK IT MAKES SENSE OR I'M HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO TALK WITH. YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD JUST SAY JUST TALK TO THEM I IN MY LIFE BEFORE HERE -- SOMETIMES UPON HIGH HAS IDEAS ABOUT HELPING SHOULD WORK AND SOMETIMES ARE GOOD IDEAS BUT NOT TALKING TO THE FOLKS THAT ARE ACTUALLY IN THE TRENCHES THE TEACHERS THE EMPLOYEES THE ONES ARE ACTUALLY DOING THE WORK AND COMMUNICATING WITH STUDENTS AND TRYING. TO HELP THE STUDENTS -- MOVE AHEAD I THINK SOMETIMES WE CAN BE A LITTLE SHORT SIGHTED SO I WOULD SAY THE MORE YOU CAN BRING FACULTY IN. AND TALK TO THEM THE MORE THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE CAN ENGAGE THEM I JUST DON'T SEE ANY DOWNSIDE TO THAT SO I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE YOU TO WORK ON THAT THERE'S ANYTHING I CAN DO TO BE HELPFUL. PLEASE LET ME KNOW WE'LL DO IT AND AND I WOULD SAY ONE OF THE OTHER STRUCTURES AND WE HAVE A LONG. AND FORMALIZE HISTORY OF CONSULTATION THE SYSTEM WE HAVE A CONSULTATION COUNCIL BUT IT AGAIN IS MADE UP OF VARIETY OF STAKEHOLDERS FROM THE SYSTEM WE WILL BE PRESENTING -- AT THEIR MEETING NEXT WEEK A SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE HOPE TO MAKE TO YOU ALL INTO THE ADMINISTRATION A LATER THIS YEAR. VERY GOOD THANK YOU. HELLO SAVING FURTHER. LET ME THANK YOU FOR A GREAT PRESENTATION -- LOOK FORWARD TO FURTHER CONVERSATION ABOUT THESE ISSUES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ISSUE NUMBER TWO ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE THIS IS AN INFORMATIONAL ITEM WHAT'S THE GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE IF I COULD HAVE YOU IDENTIFY YOURSELVES FOR THE RECORD. GOOD MORNING HEATHER HEIL CEO OF THE ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. TO SEE YOU AGAIN MA'AM SIR MORNING AT JULIA ROBERTS CFO AT THE FOUNDATION FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. MISTER ROBERTS THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. OKAY WHO WANTS TO START. I THINK OUR HOPE FOR THEIR UP IF THAT'S OKAY -- I JUST WANT TO SAY. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE SENATORS AND I WANT TO INTRODUCE MYSELF AND GIVE YOU A BIT OF AN UPDATE -- AS TO WHAT WE'VE BEEN UP TO FOR THE PAST. EIGHT WEEKS THAT I'VE BEEN ON THE JOB -- ANTI ANSWER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE -- I HAVE PERSONALLY I'M. A SOCIAL ENTREPRENEUR AND A SERIAL ENTREPRENEUR AND A TECHNOLOGIST. BUT IVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITYTO DO A LOT TO HELP PEOPLE ACHIEVE THEIR ACADEMIC GOALS AS WELL AS THEIR PROFESSIONAL GOALS FOR THE PAST THIRTY YEARS. SO -- I'M A BIT OF AN EXPERT IN WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND VERY DELIGHTED TO BE ABLE TO FACE SUCH A LARGE CHALLENGE AND TO SERVE SUCH IMPORTANT NEEDS -- AS WE'VE OUTLINED -- IN THE IN THE WAY OF YOU KNOW OVER EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHO ARE UNDEREMPLOYED OR UNEMPLOYED. AND NEED SKILLS UPGRADING TO GET LIVING WAGE JOBS -- WE HAVE IN THE WAY OF UPDATES PROBABLY THEM THE MOST PRESSING IN HIM AND INTERESTING. UPDATE IS THAT WE HAVE. STARTED ORGANIZING AND PLANNING FOR OUR FIRST THREE TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT WILL GO LIVE ON OCTOBER FIRST OF THIS YEAR. THE FIRST OF THE TRIP THREE TRAINING PROGRAMS IS MEDICAL CODING. THE SECOND ONE IS A CYBER SECURITY TRAINING PROGRAM. AND A GENERAL I. T. HELP DESK TYPE OF A POSITION THAT WILL BE TRAINING -- FOR SO AS YOU CAN IMAGINE WE ARE WORKING WITH. A NUMBER OF FACULTY ADVISORS HELPING US SELECT THE RIGHT CURRICULA AND DESIGN THE RIGHT TRAINING PROGRAM. WE ARE EXAMINING -- THE RIGHT TECHNOLOGIES TO DELIVER THE TRAINING AND BUILDING IN A LOT OF THE PLANNING AND SUPPORTS. FOR JOB COACHING -- ONCE PEOPLE ARE PLACED INTO THEIR JOBS BUT ALSO BUILDING ON NOT ONLY THE RIGHT ONLINE TRAINING PROGRAM FOR PEOPLE BUT ALSO APPLIED LEARNING EXPERIENCE. AND WE'RE ENGAGING WITH A LOT OF EMPLOYERS TO FIND THE RIGHT EMPLOYERS WHO ARE WILLING TO PAY PEOPLE TO LEARN THEIR JOBS. AND FINALLY -- I'M DOING A LOT OF WHAT A TYPICAL START UP WOULD DO IN THAT I'M LOOKING TO HIRE AT LEAST THIS. CADRE OF SENIOR LEVEL FOLKS WHO ARE GOING TO WORK WITH US TO BUILD OUT THESE PROGRAMS MOVING FORWARD. AND ENGAGING WITH OUR KEY PARTNERS FROM THE EMPLOYER AND UNION COMMUNITY. COMMUNITIES -- AND AND DOING OTHER THINGS LIKE STILL. WE'RE GETTING VERY CLOSE TO BUT FINDING OUR ACTUAL NAME FOR A COLLEGE. SO YOU KNOW THAT'S A LOT OF WHAT HAPPENS IN A START UP IS YOU HAVE TO DO SOME BASICS THAT YOU MIGHT TAKE FOR GRANTED OTHERWISE. SO I JUST WANTED TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU ALL MAY HAVE. LET [inaudible] WITH EVERYONE. LET ME -- GO AHEAD SIR LEGALLY YOU'RE SO PATIENT. SO CONGRATULATIONS THAT'S A BIG JOB STARTING A NEW SCHOOL AND FINDING THE NAME IS KEY BECAUSE YOU WANT TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW ENGAGES FOLKS. SO I JUST WANT TO ASK ABOUT YOU KNOW WITH ONLINE STUDIES I WORRY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT STUDENTS JUST BEING BEHIND THE SCREEN. HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE ABLE TO SOCIALLY ENGAGE -- AND GET THAT GOOD PAYING JOB HOW HOW DO YOU SEE YOURSELF DOING YEAH AND THAT'LL YOU KNOW -- AFTER MY LIFE AFTER I SOLD MY LAST COMPANY AT THE END OF TWENTY FIFTEEN I ENDED UP WORKING WITH THE BILL MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS -- AND I RAN A PORTFOLIO THAT INVESTED IN DEVELOPMENTAL EDUCATION DIGITAL LEARNING -- ADVISING -- FINANCIAL SECURITY ETCETERA -- AND WHAT WE'VE LEARNED THROUGH STUDY AFTER STUDY WHICH HAVE ALREADY KNOWN BUT BUT REALLY -- REINFORCED -- THIS INFORMATION THAT PEOPLE WHO TYPICALLY DIDN'T DO WELL IN TRADITIONAL EDUCATION. DO NOT PERFORM WELL ON A PURELY ONLINE EXPERIENCE. SO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS USE TECHNOLOGY. FOR WHAT IT DOES BEST WHICH IS TO DELIVER. REAL TIME IN A FLEXIBLE WAY WHEN PEOPLE NEED IT WHENEVER THAT IS. THE RIGHT CONTENT THAT THEY CAN REVIEW AND MASTER AND COMPLETE THEIR ASSESSMENTS ONLINE FOR EXAMPLE BUT IT MAY BE THAT SOMEBODY -- EVEN. THROUGH THEIR MOBILE DEVICE GETS THE RIGHT CONTENT TO TAKE YOU KNOW LEARN THE NEXT THING QUICKLY AND EASILY. BUT THAT IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR FOLKS HAVING APPLIED LEARNING EXPERIENCES ON THE JOB WHICH IS WHY PAID WORK EXPERIENCE EXPERIENCE OR APPRENTICESHIP IS CRITICAL TO OUR MODEL. AND ADDITIONALLY WHY WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SUCCESS SUPPORTS ONCE THEY'RE EVEN PLACED INTO THE JOB BECAUSE A LOT OF FOLKS IF THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THEY'VE BEEN IN THIS KIND OF WORK ENVIRONMENT NEED. ONGOING COACHING AND OTHER SUPPORTS. AND AND AND SO I I WOULD ACTUALLY CALL IT MORE ACCURATELY A BLENDED LEARNING EXPERIENCE WHICH MEANS ONLINE PLUS IN PERSON THE ALSO THE FOLKS WERE SERVING -- TYPICALLY DON'T HAVE NETWORKS THEY GET THEM INTO GETTING INTERVIEWED ARE CONSIDERED FOR JOBS EVEN -- AND LINKED IN JUST PRODUCE A STUDY THAT SAID OVER 80% OF US ACTUALLY WE GET OUR JOBS TO REFER ALL FROM FRIENDS AND FAMILY. SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT NETWORK IT'S KIND OF CHICKEN AND EGG HAD EVEN BREAK INTO THE JOBS. SO WE'VE GOT TO HELP THEM BUILD THEIR FIRST NETWORKS. THAT'S VERY HELPFUL THANK YOU. THE GREAT QUESTIONS -- LET. ONE OF MY CONCERNS -- AS WE TALKED. IS THE DEMAND SIDE OF WHAT I CALL CAREER TECH EDUCATION. WHICH IS SOMEWHAT WHAT YOU WERE ENGAGED IN AT THE ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. AND YOUR OPERATING ON A GRAND SCALE STATEWIDE. THE FOLKS AT WILL FOLLOW YOU AND SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES MAY HEAR THE SAME QUESTION. HOW DO YOU COLLECT THE INFORMATION? ON THE DEMAND SIDE -- COMPILE IT SORT IT TO FIGURE OUT HOW MANY JOBS IN MEDICAL CODING FOR EXAMPLE. ARE THERE THAT EXIST ON FILLED. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE SAME FOR THE OTHER. TWO ISSUES OF OUR FIELD TO TURN MENTIONED -- AND IS THERE A SINGLE POINT OF CONTACT IN THE IN REGIONS OR COMMUNITIES. IS IT THE SAME CONTACT THAT YOU GO TO IS THAT THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD REGIONALLY FOR EXAMPLE -- I'M I'M INTERESTED BECAUSE YOU KNOW FRANKLY I THINK WE FACE THE SAME ISSUES. WHEN WE START TALKING ABOUT THE THE CONSORTIUM THAT WE HAVE AROUND THE STATE THAT ARE DEALING WITH -- CTP -- IT'S THE A CRITICAL ISSUE AND AS I LEARNED BACK WHEN I LAUNCHED SF WORKS IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES AS A RESPONSE TO WELFARE REFORM. AND FOCUSING ON HARD SKILLS -- THE DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING AND DELIVERY OF HARD SKILLS TO GET PEOPLE OFF WELFARE INTO LIVING WAGE JOBS WHAT I LEARNED AT THAT POINT IN TIME IN ROCKEFELLER READY CASE STUDY ABOUT ON THIS MODEL WHICH IS THAT YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH EMPLOYERS AND SPECIFIC SHOPS ON THE FRONT END. BECAUSE EMPLOYERS DON'T HAVE CONFIDENCE OR EVEN KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT. COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ARE OTHERS ARE DOING TO REALLY PREPARE THEM FOR THEIR JOBS THEY JUST DON'T HAVE CONFIDENCE. IN KNOWING THAT -- PEOPLE HAVE CERTAIN KINDS OF THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT A LETTER GRADE FROM ONE INSTITUTION TO ANOTHER REALLY REPRESENTS ENOUGH THE FORM OF THIS PERSON BEING READY FOR THEIR JOB. SO. THAT REALLY BE GETS -- THE FACT THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE EMPLOYERS WITH THE JOBS WHERE THEY CAN'T FIND ENOUGH SKILLED PEOPLE AND RETAIN THEM. ON AND THEY NEED -- TO WORK WITH A PLAYER LIKE US TO SUPPLY AND FILL THE NEEDS THAT THEY CAN'T SEEM TO FILL. IT'S IT'S NOT EASY. BUT IT IS I THINK N IMPERATIVE THIS IS THE ONLY WAY THAT I KNOW HOW TO MAKE IT WORK. AND WHAT I WILL SAY IS THAT -- MANY OF OUR COMPANIES -- IN -- IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA ARE AWARE OF THE FACT THAT THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO FIND AND RETAIN THE RIGHT TALENT. ALL LONG ENOUGH AND UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF THOSE COMPANIES ALTHOUGH THEY'RE SITTING ON BILLIONS OF DOLLARS CASH DON'T NECESSARILY INVESTED INTO CALIFORNIANS. OFTENTIMES THEY OUTSOURCE THOSE JOBS THE OTHER PLACES. SO EVEN IN OUR FIRST TRAINING PROGRAM IT'S A VERY INTERESTING -- CASE STUDY BECAUSE MEDICAL CODING IS A VERY WELL PAYING JOB TODAY. BUT A LOT OF THOSE JOBS ARE BEING OUTSOURCED TO INDIA AND OTHER COUNTRIES. AND A LOT OFTHOSE JOBS -- WILL ALSO BECOE OBSOLETE IN THE NEXT DECADES BECAUSE MEDICAL CODING WHICH IS LABOR INTENSIVE NOW WILL BE HANDLED BY A I AND A LOT OF NEW TECHNOLOGY. SO I NEED TO USE THAT AS AN INCH IN ILLUSTRATION. AND A POINT WITH OUR LAWYER ADULT LEARNERS BUT IT IS YOUR ENTRYWAY INTO THE HEALTH CARE PATHWAY. IT IS THE BEGINNING OF YOUR CAREER PATH IT'S NOT THE FINAL DESTINATION. ALL WE KNOW FROM STUDIES TODAY. THAT THE AVERAGE EMPLOYEE TODAY WHO'S AROUND THE AGE OF YOU KNOW EARLY TWENTIES WILL HAVE SEVENTEEN JOBS IN FIVE DIFFERENT SECTORS OF INDUSTRY THROUGHOUT THEIR CAREER. SO THAT MEANS LIKE MY MOTHER HAD ONE JOB WORKING FOR THE IRS FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS AND IT WAS LITERALLY THE SAME JOB FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS. AND I LIKE TO SAY I'VE HAD PROBABLY THIRTY FIVE JOBS. AND IT'S A REALLY DIFFERENT WORLD WE LIVE IN NOW AND YOU CAN CALL THE GIG ECONOMY CAUGHT THIS OR THAT. WHAT I FOUND IS A LOT OF EMPLOYERS FEEL LIKE HAT MAY BE A WAY OF -- TAKING A PASS ON INVESTING IN OUR WORK FORCE AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IS INCREASINGLY MORE PEOPLE ARE GETTING DISCONNECTED FROM FULL TIME EMPLOYMENT WITH BENEFITS. IT'S LIVING WAGE SHOULD WEAR THAT ALLOWS FOR THEM TO THRIVE AND SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES. AND SO WE REALLY I THINK HAVE TO IMPRESS UPON THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY. AND I DO HAVE A STRATEGY FOR THAT -- THAT GETS THEM TO INVEST IN OUR PEOPLE AND OUR ADULT WORKERS AND AND INVESTING IN THEM TO DO BE ABLE TO TO NEW JOBS THAT THEY'VE JUST CREATED -- IN THE WAY THAT WE DO THAT IS I THINK WE MAKE A BUSINESS CASE. SO RECENTLY ACCENTURE DID A RETURN ON INVESTMENT STUDY FOR THE COMPANY DISCOVER WHICH IS A FINANCIAL. CARD CREDIT CARD. AND THEY FOUND THAT WHEN DISCOVER WAS WILLING TO PAY FOR PEOPLE'S ONGOING EDUCATION. THEY HAD BETTER RETENTION AND LOYALTY FROM THEIR EMPLOYEES THEY ALSO HAD EMPLOYEE SATISFACTION IMPROVE. THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT CASES TO BE MADE AND WE'RE RIGHT NOW WORKING WITH THE BAY AREA COUNCIL AND STARTING TO PARTNER AND TALK WITH. ON MANY DIFFERENT -- WHO WATCH ECONOMISTS AND PEOPLE WHO WATCH THE DATA AND THE LABOR STATISTICS WHICH JOBS ARE BEING? ELIMINATED WHICH ONES ARE BEING CREATED HOW MANY ARE THERE HOW MANY ARE PROJECTED TO GROW -- OVER THE NEXT DECADE TO DECADE. AND AND WE WILL PRIORITIZE OUR JOB TRAINING FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF IS THERE A GOOD ENTRY LEVEL POSITION FOR PEOPLE TO GET INTO THAT SECTOR AND INTO THAT PATHWAY. BASED ON THE TRAINING WE CAN PROVIDE CYBER SECURITY IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE THERE SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND UNFILLED JOBS NATIONWIDE. THE ONLY MORE GROWING EVERY DAY AND YOU CAN START OUT AS AN ADDED ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT. LEARN CYBER SECURITY PROTOCOLS ON THAT WHEN THERE'S A BEAUTIFUL CURRICULA WITHIN THE COMMUNICATE SYSTEM FOR THIS EXACT IT -- TRAINING PROGRAM. AND AND ENHANCE YOUR SALARY BY ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS SO THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF OPPORTUNITIES WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD OUT OUR TRAINING PROGRAMS. I REALIZE YOU'VE ONLY BEEN THERE A WEEK'S. BUT I MEAN YOU SORT OF HAVE A CHALLENGE DON'T YOU I MEAN HOW DO PEOPLE KNOW. WHO ON WHO YOU ARE? ONLINE COMMUITY COLLEGE YOU KNOW IF YOU WERE. LIVING IN INLAND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW YOU KNOW THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES YOU MAY GO TO THE FOOTBALL GAMES OF BASEBALL GAMES OR CONCERTS ON THE CAMPUS AND SO YOU GET TO KNOW WHERE THE COLLEGES ARE AND WHAT THEY DO AND AND IS A NATURAL. DRAW THERE IF YOU'RE SO INCLINED. BUT HOW DO OTHER PEOPLE KNOW. ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE I MEAN TO SOME EXTENT I GUESS YOU MADE MAYBE YOU CAN HOOK UP WITH THE LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGES IF THEY'RE WILLING TO DO SO. I WOULD GUESS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO FIND MORE CROP OF COOPERATION IN SOME PARTS OF THE STATE THAN OTHERS -- IS THAT A FAIR QUESTION THAT'S A VERY FAIR QUESTION -- AND BECAUSE WE ARE UNIQUE. INSTITUTION THAT CAN PROVIDE TRAINING THAT IS IN ESSENCE FREE TO THE LEARNER. AND REALLY BORNE BY THE EMPLOYER TO PAY FOR IT. SUCH INSTRUCTION. ON THIS IS A NEW MODEL AND A NEW OFFERING AND HONESTLY A LOT OF OUR COMPETITORS.% ARE THOSE -- PREDATORY INSTITUTIONS SPECIALLY ONLINE COLLEGE IS GOING AFTER PEOPLE'S STUDENT LOAN MONEY WITHOUT PROVIDING THEM ANY KIND OF GUARANTEES TO GOOD EMPLOYMENT OR ANY KIND OF GUARANTEED RETURN ON THEIR INVESTMENT. THAT'S OUR BIG COMPETITOR AND SO WE'RE PARTNERING WITH OUR OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGE [inaudible] PARTNERS -- TO TO RECRUIT OUR ADULT LEARNERS BACK INTO OPPORTUNITIES THAT EITHER -- WORK BEST FOR THEM THROUGH A TRADITIONAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND ENVIRONMENT OR IF THEY'RE THEY'RE KIND OF MID CAREER. AND AND AND NEEDING TO GO DIRECTLY TO EMPLOYMENT AND REALLY DON'T HAVE TIME TO DO TO BE FULL TIME STUDENTS. WELL -- THOSE ARE THE FOLKS THAT ARE PROBABLY BEST TAILORED FOR OUR OUR PROGRAM SO WE'RE REALLY OUR FIRST. TARGET -- A SUBSET OF THE MARKET IF YOU WILL IS THE TWO POINT FIVE MILLION FOLKS. AGES -- AGE. TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FOUR WHO -- WHO ARE IN NEED OF SKILLS UPGRADING BUT THEY'RE ALREADY WORKING -- PROBABLY MORE THAN FULL TIME HONESTLY JUST CAN'T MAKE ENDS MEET -- WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO DO GRASSROOTS MESSAGING TO THEM WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO DO -- OTHER KINDS OF OUTREACH TO GET THE MESSAGE AND WORD OUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT WE ARE AVAILABLE. AND SO HELP HAVING A NAME IN A WEBSITE REALLY HELPS. AND WHY WE'RE KIND OF CLOSE -- TO MASTERING THAT PART BUT THEN WE'RE ALSO GOING TO BE PARTNERING WITH LABOR UNIONS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS HOPEFULLY ALL OF YOU. AND TO TO TO LET YOU KNOW TO GET THE MESSAGE OUT THAT WERE AVAILABLE AND WE'RE HERE WE'RE ALSO GOING TO NEED. TO TAKE A LOOK AT OUR CAL GRANT PROGRAM AND DO SOME MODIFICATIONS TO THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM FOR STUDENTS IN THAT PARTICULAR AGE GROUP BECAUSE THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF LUCK. AS I UNDERSTAND IT'S CORRECT THE WAY OUR PROGRAM IS DESIGNED ONE FINAL QUESTION YOU KNOW I'M I'M SORT OF LOOKING. TO TO YOU IN THE ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. OPERATION. TO GOING BACK TO TO THE DEMAND SIDE. TO BUILD SORT OF A STATE WIDE INFRASTRUCTURE -- THAT EXTENDS THE TENTACLES EXTEND DOWN INTO LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND REGIONS -- TO IDENTIFY. WHETHER IT'S WORK REGIONAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD'S OR SOME OTHER [inaudible] EXISTING GROUP. TO BE THE POINT GROUP. FOR EMPLOYERS TO IDENTIFY JOB AND SKILL NEEDS. IT CAN THEN BE COLLECTED AND COLLATED BY YOU BUT ALSO UTILIZED BY THE REGIONAL EDUCATIONAL CONSORTIA. TO IDENTIFY THE TYPES OF PROGRAMS THAT AND DESIGN THE TYPES OF PROGRAMS THAT THEY NEED TO IN ORDER TO A DARK DRESS REGIONAL NEEDS YEAH BUT BUT YOU ARE ALMOST BEST EQUIPPED. TO DO THAT SORT OF ON A STATEWIDE BASIS SO WE HAVE CONSISTENCY. YOU KNOW FROM CHICO DECEMBER TO DENOTE TUNED. IRVINE TO SAN DIEGO AND AN EMPLOYER WITH ONE SITE WERE TWENTY FIVE SITES IN THE STATE WOULD KNOW. TO GO TO THIS PARTICULAR GROUP AND SAY. I CAN'T FIND AN X. Y. Z.. AND I'VE GOT TWENTY FIVE OF THAT I NEED. CAN YOU HELP AND THEN THAT GROUP COULD THEN PASS IT TO YOU PASS IT TO THE EDUCATIONAL CONSORTIA. AND WE COULD BEGIN TO MEET JOB NEEDS ON A MORE ORGANIZED BASIS I THINK AT LEAST THAT'S MY PERCEPTION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS THAT DOABLE. THAT IS DOABLE GENERAL RIGHT AND I THINK THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL -- VISION AS WELL I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT WHAT I'VE SEEN AGAIN THROUGH SOME OF MY RESEARCH EVEN IN STATES WHERE -- THE LABOR INFORMATION IS MORE READILY AVAILABLE TO THE EDUCATIONAL COMMUNITY -- THERE'S A HUGE LAG BETWEEN -- WHAT EMPLOYERS ARE DOING REAL TIME CREATING NEW JOBS THAT HAVE NEW COMPETENCIES ATTACHED TO THEM? AND HOW IT GETS ACTUALLY PUBLISHED OR ORGANIZED IN A DATABASE WHICH IS USUALLY TWO OR THREE YEARS OUT OF TOUCH BY THE TIME IT'S ACTUALLY UPDATED. AND THEN WHEN IT HOW DOES IT MEAN WHEN DOES IT GET TRANSLATED TO SOME KIND OF INSTRUCTION SYSTEM. WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE ETHER AND SO THE SYSTEM IS UNFORTUNATELY -- UNDER DEVELOPED RIGHT NOW AND I THINK THAT WITH TODAY'S TECHNOLOGIES ESPECIALLY. WELL THERE ARE LOTS OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES BUT WE HAVE A WAY WHERE WE COULD ACTUALLY PUT THAT ONLINE. AND TAKE TAKE THE WITH THE OTHER BENEFITS OF MEDITATED TAKE THAT THAT INFORMATION AND MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE -- THROUGHOUT THE STATE REAL TIME AND I THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE A HUGE CONTRIBUTION TO THE ENTIRE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY BECAUSE I WAS READING IT FOR YOU. I WAS READING IT THE LOGISTICS INDUSTRY AND AND INLAND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT NEEDS. TWENTY TWENTY THOUSAND EMPLOYEES I'VE TRIED OTHER GOOD JOB BUT I THOUGHT WELL WHAT IS WHAT DOES THAT MEAN. WHAT WHAT WHAT KIND DO YOU DO WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT TYPES OF JOBS WHAT JOBS SKILLS ARE REQUIRED FOR THE? TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN IT IT'S IT'S IT'S TWENTY THOUSAND FOOT DATA. BUT THAT'S NOT HOW YOU PLAN AN EDUCATIONAL THAT'S RIGHT. CURRICULAR TRAINING PROGRAMS RIGHT OR TRAINING PROGRAM WE NEED TO HAVE MORE SPECIFIC INFORMATION AND THAT'S WHY I THINK YOU COULD PLAY A KEY ROLE IN THIS. ELEVEN A FOR THE QUESTION. YOUR ANSWER TO ME WAS PERFECT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION I LOOK FORWARD TO THE RESULTS OF YOUR HARD WORK I LOOK FORWARD TO COMING BACK AND GIVE ANY UPDATES THANK YOU THANK YOU. ISSUE NUMBER THREE IS COMMUNITY COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY. ALMOST THE SAME GROUP MA'AM WOULD YOU IDENTIFY YOURSELF FOR THE RECORD PLEASE. THE THINKING WITH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. THANK YOU. OKAY WHO WANTS TO START OFF LEAD OFF WITH THIS [inaudible] ONE FINANCE. SEAN DOING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES FORTY MILLION DOLLARS PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT. A SECOND YEAR FREE TUITION BY EXTENDING THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE THE FIRST TIME FULL TIME STUDENTS IN THEIR SECOND ACADEMIC YEAR. THE PROPOSAL BUILDS ON CURRENT LAW AS ESTABLISHED BY A. B. NINETEEN WHICH ITSELF ESTABLISHED THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE. AND ALLOWS COLLEGES TO WAIVE FEES FOR THAT FIRST YEAR OF COLLEGE FOR FIRST TIME FULL TIME STUDENTS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL DOES NOT CHANGE ANY OF THE EXISTING PROVISIONS OF THE CURRENT LAW EXCEPT FOR EXTENDING THE PROGRAM TO A SECOND ACADEMIC YEAR. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO PROPOSES FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. FOR THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO EXPAND OUT REACH AROUND THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE BY ESTABLISHING THE STUDENT SUCCESS AWARENESS INITIATIVE. AS MORE COLLEGES IMPLEMENT PROMISE PROGRAMS THERE IS A NEED TO ENSURE THAT COLLEGES CAN EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATE TO STUDENTS INFORMATION ABOUT THESE PROMISE PROGRAMS. THE COST OF ATTENDANCE IN THEIR FINANCIAL AID OPPORTUNITIES AND PATHWAYS TO SUCCESS. THIS FUNDING IS INTENDED TO ADDRESS THAT NEED. THANK YOU AND HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. AND AGAIN THE EXPANSION OF COLLEGE PROMISES WITHOUT REGARD TO FINANCIAL NEED [inaudible] CORRECT [inaudible] OKAY -- THANK YOU. I'LL BE SPEAKING FROM YOUR AGENDA STARTING ON PAGE. FIFTEEN AS YOU KNOW THE STATE HAS A LONG STANDING PROGRAM CALLED THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS FEE WAIVER THAT PROVIDES ENROLLMENT FEE WAIVERS FOR STUDENTS WHO HAVE FINANCIAL NEED. CURRENTLY OVER 40% OF CCC STUDENTS RECEIVE FULL FEE WAIVERS THROUGH THIS PROGRAM. AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE A SHARED THE STATE DID RECENTLY EXTENDS THIS PROGRAM RATHER EXPEND FEE WAIVERS. TO SELECTED STUDENTS WITHOUT FINANCIAL. SPECIFICALLY THE STUDENTS ARE FIRST TIME STUDENTS ENROLLING FULL TIME. DURING THE FIRST YEAR OF COLLEGE. ST FIRST FUNDED THIS PROGRAM CALLED THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE PROGRAM. IN THE CURRENT YEAR. TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND IN ORDER TO RECEIVE FUNDS UNDER THIS PROGRAM COLLEGES ARE REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN SIX IN SUPPORT PRACTICES. WHAT ARE DETAILED ON PAGE SIXTEEN OF YOUR AGENDA? IN THE SENSE THIS PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO SERVE AS AN INCENTIVE FOR COLLEGES CAN PROOF CAN SUPPORT. FINANCE TO SHED THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING TO AUGMENT FUNDING FOR THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE PROGRAM. IN ORDER TO FUD A SECONDARY FEE WAIVERS FOR SKIN FLAP FINANCIAL NEED. OUR OFFICE DOES HAVE A NUMBER OF CONSENSUS PROPOSAL. WHICH ARE LISTED ON PAGE EIGHTEEN OF YOUR CONTACT. TOWARD THE BOTTOM. THE FIRST OF OUR THREE CONCERNS IS LARGELY A MATTER OF TIMING. BECAUSE THE STATE FIRST FUNDED THIS PROGRAM IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IT'S TO SEND TOO SOON TO VALIDATE THE OUTCOMES UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT IT'S HAD ON COLLEGE ENROLLMENT FINANCIALLY PARTICIPATION AND SKIP OUTCOMES. AND WITHOUT THIS INFORMATION WE THINK IT MAY BE PREMATURE TO EXPAND THE PROGRAM AND NEARLY DOUBLED FUNDING. OUR SECOND CONCERN IS MRE DISTRIBUTIONAL NATURE. AS THE SUBCOMMITTEE KNOWS WELL THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF UNMET FINANCIAL NEED RIGHT NOW AMONG COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO NON TUITION COSTS WHICH ARE OF COURSE NOT COVERED BY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS WHO EVER. GIVEN THAT THE GOAL HERE IS TO INCREASE COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY WE THINK THAT IT MAY MAKE SENSE TO START WITH ADDRESSING THE UNMET NEED IN THE SYSTEM. BEFORE TURNING TO EXPANDING FEE WAIVERS FOR STUDENTS WITH OUT NEED. I THEIR CONCERN JUST RETURNS TO THE POINT THAT THE COLLEGE PROMISE PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO INCENTIVIZE COLLEGES TO IMPROVE SKIN SUPPORT. HERE WE JUST NOTE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS ALSO ENACTED NUMBER OF REFORMS INCLUDING THE SKIN CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA. THAT PROVIDE LARGER INCENTIVES FOR COLLEGES TO IMPROVE STUDENT SUPPORT NOW COMES. SO FOR THESE REASONS WE DO RECOMMEND REJECTING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO AUGMENT FUNDING FOR THE COLLEGE PROMISE PROGRAM. AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE SHARED THERE IS ALSO A RELATED PUZZLED PROVIDE FIVE MILLION IN ONE TIME FUNDS. EXPAND OUTREACH RELATED TO THE COLLEGE PROMISE AND OTHER STUDENT SUPPORT PROGRAMS. OUR OFFICE IS CURRENTLY REVIEWING THIS PROPOSAL AND WILL BE SURE TO KEEP THE COMMITTEE AND STAFF UPDATED AS WE REACH AN ASSESSMENT. THANK YOU WOULD BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. I'M SURE HELLO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO AS WE SEE IN THE EXAMPLE OF TUITION ONLY ACCOUNTS 45% OF TOTAL COST OF GOING TO A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. SO MY QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT THE ELLIE -- SEES A ROLE FOR A TARGETED GRANT PROGRAM. THAT ADDRESSES THE NON TUITION COSTS FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. WELL THE ANSWER THAT QUESTION AND OUR ASSESSMENT OF THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL OFFICE HAS IN THE PAST EXPLORED OPTIONS TO EXPAND ON TUITION COVERAGE. FOR STUDENTS AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND AT OTHER PUBLIC SEGMENTS. I HAVE A FEW YEARS AGO RELEASED RECORD ON CUTTING IT UP FOR COLLEGE PUZZLE THAT EXAMINES THAT KIND OF MODEL. AND WE DID THAT AT THE REQUEST OF THE LEGISLATURE. THERE ARE ALSO A FEW EXISTING PROGRAMS FUNDED THROUGH PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDS THAT ARE LISTED ON PAGE FIFTEEN OF YOUR AGENDA. THAT SEEK TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE NON TUITION COSTS FACED BY THE STUDENTS. BUT EVEN WITH THESE PROGRAMS IN PLACE MANY STUDENTS YOU HAVE UNMET NEEDS AS YOU KNOW. VERY GOOD SO I DO HAVE A BILL. SB TWO NINETY ONE THAT WOULD HELP FIND A SOLUTION FOR NON TUITION COSTS. AND MY HOPE IS THAT OF COURSE BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR'S DESK AND HE SIGNS IT I JUST HAVE A REAL CONCERN THAT YOU KNOW IN THE EXAMPLE THAT YOU -- PROVIDED ON PAGE NINETEEN IT'S JUST SO CLEARLY LAYS OUT THE TUITION IS JUST SUCH A SMALL FRACTION OF WHAT THE STUDENTS -- NEED TO COME UP WITH AND PAY IN ORDER TO GO TO COMMUNICATE COMMITTEE COLLEGE THERE'S HOPE THAT WE CAN ALL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THAT AND LOOK AT THE OTHER THINGS THAT OUR STUDENTS NEED SO THAT THEY CAN. COMPLETE THEIR DEGREE OR THEIR CERTIFICATE. THANK YOU. WE WILL LIVE. ZERO IT YOU GO COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THEN I HAVE AN OBSERVATION BUT SOUNDS GOOD I'M GONNA GO BACK TO THE PACKET A AHEAD OF WE HAVE PREPARED AND START ON PAGE SEVEN AND THEN I THINK I'LL BE TAKING A A BROADER VIEW OF COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY -- THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ON THIS PANEL YET AND SO I WANTED TO START AND AND SENATOR OUT THIS GOES TO TO YOUR POINT ABOUT WHO ATTENDS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND SO WE WE'VE SHOWN YOU TWO CHARTS THERE. I THINK -- WHAT WE SEE IN THOSE CHARTS IS THAT WE SERVE A -- AN OLDER POPULATION OF STUDENTS STUDENTS WHO ARE COMING TO HIGHER EDUCATION DIRECTLY FROM HIGH SCHOOL. MORE THAN 40% OF OUR STUDENTS ROACH OVER THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE AND IT IN ITS SKEWS SIGNIFICANTLY OLDER GENERALLY. WE ALSO SEE ON THE RIGHT THAT WE SERVE A CONSIDERABLY DIVERSE STUDENT POPULATION WITH A NEARLY HALF OF OUR STUDENTS IDENTIFY AS LATIN ACTS. AND SO AS WE THINK ABOUT THAT. YOU KNOW A COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY IN THE STATE'S POLICIES AROUND CULTURE FORTY ABILITY I THINK WE YOU KNOW WE CARE A LOT ABOUT WHO -- THE EQUITY ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH -- OURS INSTITUTIONS ARE SERVING AND HOW AFFORDABLE IT IS BEEN. US ON THE BOTTOM OF PAGE SEVEN AGAIN WE TALKED ABOUT -- NO THE INFORMATION SHARED THIS CONVERSATION HAS FOCUSED ON TUITION -- AND WE I THINK ARE VERY -- PROUD OF A HISTORY OF LOW TUITION AND OF THE FACT THAT MOST OF OUR STUDENTS -- NEARLY HALF OF OUR STUDENTS. DON'T PAY TUITION. AB NINETEEN I THINK THE ONE THING I WOULD WANT TO KNOW TODAY MOVING TO PAGE. DOES THAT MEAN JUST INTERRUPT AND I APOLOGIZE BUT DOES. DO YOU CAPTURE ALL OF THOSE WHO HAVE FINANCIAL NEED. WITH I GUESS WHAT YOU WE USED TO CALL THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS WAIVER. SO WITHOUT THAT THEN WE HAVE A DEFINITION OF FINANCIAL NEED AS PART OF THE PROGRAM AND WE SAY IF YOU HAVE FINANCIAL NEED YOU HAVE YOUR TUITION WAVED. US STUDENTS WOULD ALSO HAVE THEIR FEES WAIVED OB IF THEY RECEIVED -- OTHER FORMS OF PUBLIC ASSISTANCE OR IF THEY FALL BELOW CERTAIN INCOME THRESHOLDS SO WE'VE TAKEN CARE OF THOSE WITH. WHAT I WOULD CALL FINANCIAL NEED WE HAVE FOCUSED CROSSES AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM CORRECT? I MEAN THE ROUGH BUT IT'S ONE OF THE OF COURSE. I'M ON THE TOP OF PAGE IT I WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT ALTHOUGH A B. -- NINETEEN THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE PROGRAM TALKS -- IT IS IT IS BEEN LARGELY TALKED ABOUT AS A FREE TUITION PROGRAM IF YOU LOOK AT THE GOALS -- THAT THE LEGISLATURE SAT IN A B. NINETEEN THE GOALS ARE MUCH BROADER -- AND THEY ARE VERY CONSISTENT WITH THE BOARD'S VISION TO INCREASE COLLEGE PREPARATION FOR STUDENTS TO IMPROVE PREPARATION FOR IN DEMAND JOBS TO INCREASE TRANSFER. AND ELIMINATE EQUITY GAPS ACROSS REGIONS IN ACROSS GROUPS OF STUDENTS. AND SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE PROGRAM THERE'S A SET OF PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY PARTNER WITH LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES THAT USE THE ABLE MAN OUR REFORMS TO DEVELOPMENTAL EDUCATION THEY PARTICIPATING GOTTA PATHWAYS. AND THEY MAKE SURE THAT STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO THE RANGE OF FINANCIAL AID AVAILABLE INCLUDING FEDERAL LOANS -- WHICH IT WE ARE I THINK OUR POSITION THERE HAS VERY CLEARLY BEEN WE DON'T -- WE WISH WE DIDN'T HAVE AN ENVIRONMENT AND WE'LL TALK LATER ABOUT -- OUR PLAN FOR HOW YOU REDUCE -- BORROWING BUT THAT STUDENTS WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO FEDERAL LOANS -- ARE OFTEN FORCED INTO LESS DESIRABLE WAYS OF BORROWING OR INTO WORKING UNREASONABLE AMOUNTS OF OURS TO MEET THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOALS. AND SO THAT'S HOW THE STILL BE INSTITUTIONS GET INTO THE PROGRAM -- THEY CAN USE THE MONEY TO WAIVE TUITION FOR THOSE STUDENTS WHO ARE FIRST TIME FULL TIME STUDENTS BUT THEY CAN USE IT FOR OTHER PURPOSES THAT ALSO WOULD. ALLOW THE INSTITUTION TO MEET THOSE GOALS. AND SO IF YOU GO TO THE TOP OF PAGE NINE I WOULD JUST NOTE OF THE PROGRAM IN THE CURRENT YEAR WAS FUNDED WITH FORTY SIX MILLION. WE ALLOCATED MOST OF THE DOLLARS -- THE COLLEGES BASED ON THE NUMBER OF THOSE FIRST TIME FULL TIME STUDENTS WHO WEREN'T ALREADY RECEIVING FEE WAIVERS BUT WE ALSO TOOK INTO ACCOUNT -- THE ENROLLMENT AT THE COLLEGES AND THE NUMBER OF POCKET RECIPIENTS OF THE COLLEGES IN NINETEEN TWENTY UP THE LEVEL OF PREPARATIONS OF EIGHTY MILLION OF THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES. WE WOULD LIKELY -- ALLOCATE FUNDING -- OLD WE BASED ON THE NUMBER FOR FIRST TIME FULL TIME STUDENTS. ON THE BOTTOM OF PAGE -- NINE WE PRODUCED A CHART THAT IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE CHART AND THE AGENDA THE CHART ON THE AGENDA LOOKED AT SAN DIEGO MESA COLLEGE WE LOOK HERE AT RIVERSIDE CITY COLLEGE. AND AGAIN THE SAME POINT THAT A VERY SMALL -- FOR ALL OF REGARDLESS OF THE STUDENTS LIVING SITUATION LESS THAN 10% OF THE FUNDS OF THE COST OF ATTENDING A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. ARE THOSE COSTS OF TUITION AND FEES. ON PAGE TEN I JUST WANT TO GO TO YOUR POINT SENATOR ROTH -- THERE ARE BARRIERS IN THE CURRENT CAL GRANT PROGRAMS THAT MAKE IT VERY UNLIKELY THAT A STUDENT AT THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES WOULD RECEIVE A CHARACTER AND THE PRIMARY BERRIER -- IS THAT IN ORDER TO BE ENTITLED TO AN AWARD THE STUDENT MUST ROLAND COLLEGE NO LATER THAN ONE YEAR AFTER HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION. IF A STUDENT DOES NOT GET AN ENTITLEMENT THEY ARE COMPETING FOR ONE OF TWENTY SIX THOUSAND AWARDS. IN A RECENT ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS OUR COMPETING FOR THESE AWARDS. SO IT'S LESS THAN A WATT INTENTIONS. AND THEN -- BECAUSE THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM IS LARGELY LINKED TO TUITION VERY FEW COMMUNITY CALL A VERY FEW OF THE DOLLARS. I GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE TEN ARE WE SHOW ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO WERE RECEIVING AWARDS. SO NEARLY A MILLION STUDENTS RECEIVE THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE GRANT. AROUND A HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS RECEIVE CALTRANS. ALSO WE'VE DECIDED THAT THE STUDENTS RECEIVE THE CALLS FROM SCREENER FINANCIALLY NEEDY -- BUT ARE LESS THAN 10% OF THEM ARE RECEIVING CAL GRANTS BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE RIGHT SIDE. OF THE VERY FEW OF THE CALIBER OF DOLLARS ARE GOING TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS SO WITH WE IN TERMS OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN CALGARY A REFORM. IT IT IT REALLY NEEDS TO BE. MORE THAN JUST INCREASING THE NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE AWARDS CORRECT WE BELIEVE AS I RECALL IF WE TOOK THE SECOND YEAR OF THE PROMISE MONEY WE COULD PROBABLY DOUBLE THE COMPETITIVE AWARDS MAYBE. TO FIFTY THOUSAND FROM TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT POTENTIALLY I WOULD SAY ONE OF THE CONCERNS WE HAVE IN THIS CONVERSATION -- AND SENATOR LABOR THIS BILL -- NOTES THIS IN ITS INTENT NOT ONLY DO COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS RECEIVED VERY LITTLE AND FINANCIAL AID BUT OUR INSTITUTIONS ARE FUNDED AND VERY LOW LOW LEVELS OF PER STUDENT FUNDING COMBAT SPECIALLY COMPARED TO UC AND CSU. EVEN LOWER COMPARED TO K. TWELVE AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WOULD -- HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT A PROPOSAL LIKE THAT -- IS THAT WE WOULD BE TAKING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT DOLLARS POTENTIALLY IN USING IT FOR OTHER PURPOSES WHAT OUR INSTITUTIONS NEED THAT ONEY. TO AND SO I THINK WHAT SENATOR LABORS BILL WE ARE VERY MUCH SUPPORT -- THEY APPROACH CENTER LATEST TAKEN IN HER BILL -- OF ALLOCATING FUNDING OUTSIDE OF THE MINIMUM GUARANTEED TO SUPPORT THE THE ISSUES OF AFFORDABILITY AT COMMUNITY COLLEGES BUT I MEAN I MY POINT WAS THE MAGNITUDE OF THE DOLLARS IT IS LISTED AS INCREASING THE COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM WE HAVE TO CHANGE WHAT THE COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM DOES. VIS A VIS OMMUNITY COLLEGES BECAUSE IT'S BECAUSE IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE FEE. IT'S THE LIVING EXPENSES EVEN FOR STUDENTS WHO GOT WHO -- RECEITA WHO WINDOW THE THE PRICE TO GET THAT COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT THEY GET A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE OF SIXTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS IS THE LIVING STIPEND THAT THAT. THAT THOSE STUDENTS WOULD RECEIVE DEMEANOR UP AND DOWN AND OUT. SOMEONE PAGE -- ELEVEN WE'VE JUST COMPARE THEIR ENROLLMENT ACROSS THE THREE PUBLIC SEGMENTS WHERE YOU SEE THAT ENROLLMENT EARLY AND ENROLLMENT IF HOW GREAT RECIPIENTS IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. TO THE CAL GRANT FUNDS THAT ARE ALLOCATED ACROSS THOSE -- THREE INSTITUTE A THREE SEGMENTS WHERE THE WERE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES RECEIVES BY FAR -- OF LOS MEDI CAL GRANT FUND AGAIN FOR THOSE TWO PURPOSES AND AND I WOULD SAY WE MAKE THIS COMPARISON NOT TO SAY THAT. OTHERS SHOULD RECEIVE LESS BUT TO SAY THAT WE KNOW HOW TO PROVIDE AID TO STUDENTS IN OTHER PLACES WERE JUST NOT PROVIDING IT TO THIS SEGMENT. THAT IS SERVING A CONSIDERABLY A VERY DIVERSE POPULATION IN A POPULATION OF OLDER STUDENTS WHO HAVE FACED THE HIGHEST BIDDERS TO ACCESS. AND SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE IMPACT ON THE BOTTOM OF PAGE -- ELEVEN YOU'LL SEE THAT ACROSS TE THE INSTITUTE FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS DID AN ANALYSIS AND SHOWS THAT IN. ALL NINE REGIONS WHERE THERE'S AN UNDERGRADUATE UC CAMPUS. COMMUNITY COLLEGES. DON'T HAVE THE LOWEST IN THAT PRICE FOR THE LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS AND IN SEVEN OF THOSE REGIONS THEY'RE THE MOST EXPECT A EXPENSIVE OPTION FOR STUDENTS. ON PAGE TWELVE WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS MORE THE NEXT AGENDA ITEM BUT THERE'S AN IMPACT NOT ONLY ON STUDENT SUCCESS. BUT ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR STUDENTS WHILE THEY'RE ATTENDING COLLEGE ARE THE HOPE CENTER -- FOR COLLEGE COMMUNITY AND JUSTICE DID A A STUDY OF BASIC NEEDS SECURITY IN OUR COLLEGES. AND FOUND THAT HALF OF OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WERE FITTED SECURE IN THE PAST THIRTY DAYS 60% WERE HOUSING IN SECURITY AND SECURE AND NEARLY ONE IN FIVE FOR HOMELESS IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR. SO THAT ALL LEADS US. TO OUR BIG CALL FOR REFORM WE'VE GOT SHOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL AID BASED ON FINANCIAL NEED NOTHING ELSE. THAT THEY SHOULD BE THAT FINANCIAL AID SHOULD BE LINKED TO THE TOTAL COST NOT JUST TUITION AND FEES. AND THAT IT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE EQUITABLY ACROSS EDUCATIONAL GOALS NOT NECESSARILY FOCUSED ONLY ON STUDENTS SEEKING DEGREES ARE -- TO TRANSFER TO A FOUR YEAR INSTITUTION BUT ALSO THOSE WHO COME TO OUR COLLEGES WITH CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION GOALS. AND SO ON PAGE THIRTEEN JUST TO CLOSE -- WE THINK -- SP TWO NINETY ONE US AUTHORED BY SENATOR LLEVA IS THE RIGHT WAY TO GO WE ARE VERY PROUD TO FOLLOW IN HER LEADERSHIP. ON THESE ISSUES ESSENTIALLY THE BILL CREATES A NEW GRANT PROGRAM THAT WE CONSIDER THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE. SUBTRACT OUT WHAT WE EXPECT STUDENTS ND FAMILIES TO PAY AS WELL AS WHAT THE WHAT OTHER RECEIVING AND CURRENT GRANTED. AND THEN THAT DIFFERENCE THAT UNMET NEED. WOULD BE PROVIDED IN THE FORM OF A NEW GRANT THAT WOULD PHASE IN OVER SIX YEARS. AND SO THE ASK OF THIS COMMITTEE OBVIOUSLY -- MR SURE WE WOULD LOVE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE BILL BUT ALSO TO INCLUDE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION. IN THE BUDGET FOR NINETEEN TWENTY TO SUPPORT THE FIRST YEAR OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT PER DOES IT ELIMINATE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN ENTITLEMENT GRANTS AND COMPETITIVE GRANTS FOR PURPOSES OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE OF FUNCTIONAL YES IT DOESN'T ELIMINATE THE STATUTES BUT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE STUDENT THE STUDENT WOULD NO. LONGER IF THE STUDENT RECEIVED A CAL GRANT THAT WOULD OFFSET THE TOTAL COST IF IT DOESN'T WE PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE BUT STILL YOU'D HAVE YOUR LIMITED TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND COMPETITIVE GRANTS SO IF YOU'RE NOT. IF YOU'RE NOT. A COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENT WITHIN A YEAR OF GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL AND A LARGE PORTION OF YOUR FOLKS OR NOT YEAH -- SO THEY GET MORE UNDER THIS PROGRAM THAT IS SO YES THEY RECEIVE A COMPETITIVE RIO REGARDLESS SO THIS PROGRAM IS TO SAY -- THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS WHY -- IT'S DIFFICULT TO UNWIND ALL OF THESE DECISIONS WE'VE MADE PREVIOUSLY. BUT FOR THE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE STUDENT FINANCIAL AID -- SHOULD BE AWARDED EQUITABLY IT SHOULD BE THOSE DECISIONS SHOULD BE BLIND TO THE STUDENT THEY SHOULD SUBMIT A A FINANCIAL AID APPLICATION WE CALCULATE THEIR NEED WE LOOK AT WHAT THEY'RE GETTING ALREADY AND THEN WE GIVE THEM A AN AMOUNT TO GO -- TO CLOSE THAT GAP [inaudible] PERFECT. LET ME ASK YOU. SIR. I'M GOOD. IF I COULD HAVE SAID IT BETTER THANK YOU. I WILL USE THIS NET PRICE FLOOD THAT PRICE FOR LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS IS THAT BECAUSE THE COST OF LIVING IN PARTICULAR AREAS. AND THE AND THE LACK OF FOR EXAMPLE DORMITORIES AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES NO IT REALLY IS AT THE POINT THERE IS THAT THE TOTAL COST IS ACTUALLY RELATIVELY SIMILAR ONCE YOU TAKE AWAY THE TUITION -- THE DIFFERENCES INTUITION ACROSS SEGMENTS OF THE OTHER COSTS OF ATTENDANCE -- FOOD HOUSING TRANSPORTATION ARE RELATIVELY SIMILAR CROSS SEGMENTS AND SO STUDENTS FACE SIMILAR TOTAL COST BUT THEY FACE THEY HAVE DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF FINANCIAL AID AVAILABLE TO THEM. WITH STUDENTS AT THE UC WRIST -- HAVING AVAILABLE THE MOST FINANCIALLY. AND SO WHEN YOU SUBTRACT OUT THAT AID -- YOU FIND THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN MANY PLACES IN MOST PLACES ARE THE MOST EXPECT EXPENSIVE I SHOULD BE VERY INTERESTING STATISTIC -- INTERESTING. OKAY I DON'T THINK I HAVE -- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ON THIS. ONE BUT LET ME CHECK. NOPE I READ THEM ALL. EXCELLENT PRESENTATIONS ARE LIVING VIDEO. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LET'S MOVE. TO ISSUE NUMBER. FIVE BASIC NEEDS AND MENTAL HEALTH THIS IS AN INFORMATIONAL ITEM. IT IS GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT OUR EFFORTS AROUND FOOD PANTRIES AND CALIBRATION ROMAN AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. MY NAME IS COLLEEN GALLEON I'M A PROGRAM SPECIALIST WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE I WORK ON ALL THINGS BASIC NEEDS INCLUDING. HOUSING AND FOOD -- MENTAL HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES TO STUDENTS I ALSO WORK ON FOSTER CARE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES TO HOMELESS STUDENTS -- AS YOU KNOW WITH THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET PROVIDED TWO AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO ESTABLISH THEMSELVES AS HUNGER FOR CAMPUSES. THE FUNDS WERE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH STANDARD APPORTIONMENT PROCESSES TO ALL HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN COLLEGES AND THAT WAS BASED ON ENROLLMENT PER EACH OF THE COLLEGES. OF THE FUNDS WERE DESIGNATED TO IDENTIFY STAFF PEOPLE ON CAMPUS TO SUPPORT STUDENTS GETTING CROW ENROLLED IN CAL FIRST BENEFITS AND TO ESTABLISH OR EXPAND UPON. A FOOD PANTRY SERVICES AT EACH OF THE CAMPUSES. OF THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET ALSO PROVIDED TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO ADDRESS HUNGER AND BASIC NEEDS THESE FUNDS WERE DISTRIBUTED ALSO THROUGH APPORTIONMENT. TODAY WE ARE PROVIDING A PRELIMINARY REPORT OUR HUNGER FOR CAMPUS REPORT YOU EACH HAVE A COPY NOW -- WE CURRENTLY HAVE A SURVEY OUT ACROSS OUR SYSTEM TO A HUNDRED FOURTEEN COLLEGES REQUESTING ADDITIONAL DETAILS ABOUT HOW MANY STIRRED STUDENTS THEY'RE SERVING WITH FOOD PANTRY. SERVICES AND WITH CAL FOR GENERAL MEANT. THOUGH TODAY WE CAN REPORT ON SOME PRELIMINARY DATA THAT WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN OUT OF OUR HUNDRED FOURTEEN COLLEGES. THAT ARE OFFERING FOOD PANTRY SERVICES AND OR REGULAR FOOD DISTRIBUTION ON CAMPUS. SIXTY OF THE COLLEGES HAVE PARTNERED WITH THEIR CAL FRESH STAFF FROM THE COUNTY TO HELP STUDENTS GET ENROLLED IN COVERAGE. SEVENTY THREE SEVENTY THREE OF THE COLLEGES ARE ACTIVELY PROVIDING INFORMATION TO STUDENTS ABOUT HOW FRESH. OVER SEVEN THOUSAND STUDENTS IN THIS IS PRELIMINARY DATA OVER SEVEN THOUSAND STUDENTS HAVE BEEN ASSISTED WITH HOW FRESH APPLICATIONS AND WE HAVE. SIX HUNDRED IDENTIFIED FACULTY AND STAFF THAT ARE SUPPORTING STUDENTS TO GET ENROLLED IN CAL FRESH AND OTHER PUBLIC BENEFIT PROGRAMS INCLUDING MEDICARE. THIRTY OF THE COLLEGE'S REPORT OPERATING BASIC NEEDS CENTERS ON THE CAMPUSES. WE ANTICIPATE THESE NUMBERS TO INCREASE AS ADDITIONAL COLLEGES RESPOND TO THE SURVEY AND HOPE TO PROVIDE MORE DETAIL LATER THIS YEAR. OUR OFFICE RECENTLY PARTNERED AS CHRISTIAN MENTIONED OUR OFFICE PARTNERED WITH THE HOPE CENTER TO CONDUCT THIS STUDENT SURVEY AROUND BASIC NEEDS. A 50% OF THE STUDENTS REPORTING OF HUNGER IN THE PREVIOUS THIRTY DAYS 60% REPORTING HOUSING IN SECURITY AND 19% REPORTING. HAVING EXPERIENCED HOMELESSNESS IN THE PREVIOUS TWELVE MONTHS. THE REASONS THERE IS AN INCREASE IN HUNGER AND HOMELESSNESS AMONG COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS AND AGAIN CHRISTIAN IT'S ALREADY ALLUDED TO THIS IS THAT. THEY DON'T RECEIVE ENOUGH FINANCIALLY TO COVER THE TRUE COST OF ATTENDANCE -- AND THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS WITH ZERO EXPECTED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION -- ACCESS TO PUBLIC BENEFITS IS OFTEN COMPLICATED AND IT'S HARD FOR STUDENTS TO NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM'S TO APPLY FOR AND RECEIVE THE BENEFITS FOR WHICH THEY'RE LIKELY ELIGIBLE. AND THEN THE COST OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA IN A SPECIFICALLY AROUND HOUSING HAS INCREASED PRETTY DRAMATICALLY OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS. LET ME ASK A QUESTION ABOUT THE SURVEY I'M LOOKING AT OUR ANALYSIS AND I'M NOT A NUMBERS PERSON WHICH IS WHAT I ONCE WAS A LAWYER BUT SO THE SURVEY. 50% FOOD IN SECURE 60% HOUSING AND SECURE. 19% HOMELESS AND THEN -- ANALYSIS INDICATES THE SURVEY FOUND THAT 22% OF FOOD IN SECURE STUDENTS RECEIVED [inaudible] SNAP BENEFITS HELP FRESH SCENT AND 8% WHO RECEIVED WHO EXPERIENCED HOMELESSNESS RECEIVED HOUSING -- ASSISTANCE SO. 22% VERSUS 50% WHO REPORT FOOD AND SECURITY AND 8% VERSUS OF HOUSING AND SECURITY. THERE IS A DELTA. IF I'M READING IT RIGHT. WHAT ARE WE DOING TO CLOSE WHAT WHAT IT WHAT IT COUNTS FOR THE DELTA AND WHY AREN'T MORE OF THE? STUDENTS WHO. REPORT FOOD AND SECURITY -- RECEIVING SAT BENEFITS IS THERE A REASON WELL I THINK THAT THE HOUSING ISSUE THE THIS SNAP ON CASE OKAY HOW FRESH IS A COMPLICATED BENEFIT TO ACCESS AND IT'S BASED ON A NUMBER OF VARIABLES. HISTORICALLY STUDENTS TAKING SIX OR MORE UNITS WERE. ESSENTIALLY DEEMED IN ELIGIBLE UNLESS THEY COULD VERIFY THAT THEY WORKED TWENTY HOURS PER WEEK ON AVERAGE EIGHTY HOURS PER MONTH. AND FOR MANY OF THE STUDENTS THAT WAS CHALLENGING -- TO PROVIDE THAT CUT THE TYPE OF INFORMATION TO THE COUNTIES AM BACK IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN A BILL PASSED WHICH WAS. NINETEEN THIRTY THAT ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO CREATE A LIST OF PROGRAMS. THAT WOULD -- NEARER EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PROGRAMS AND GIVE STUDENTS AN EXEMPTION. FOR THE TWENTY HOUR WORK WORK ROLE -- AND SO THE DEPARTMENT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE NUMBER OF STAKEHOLDERS CAME UP WITH A PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND PROGRAMS AT FOUR YEAR SCHOOLS. THAT WOULD EXEMPT STUDENTS FROM HAVING TO WORK THIS TWENTY HOURS OR EIGHTY HOURS PER MONTH -- IT'S OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE NEW PROVISIONS HAS BEEN SLOW. WHEN WAS IT? IT WELL THE BILL TO CREATE A WORK GROUP TO BEGIN WORKING ON THE ISSUE -- PAST I BELIEVE IN. TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN NOW THE WORKGROUP DID THE WORK AND A AND A VERY ROBUST WORK TO COME UP WITH A VERY COMPREHENSIVE LIST BUT IT WAS JUST WITHIN THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF. THAT THAT INFORMATION HAS BEEN FORMALIZED AND DOCUMENTED AND ROLLED OUT TO THE COUNTY SO WHAT HAPPENS IS STUDENTS COME. THEY FILL OUT THEIR APPLICATION THEY GO TO THE COUNTY OR THE YOU KNOW GET ON THE PHONE WITH THE COUNTY FOR AN INTERVIEW. AND IF ALL -- AND AND OBVIOUSLY ELIGIBILITY IS COMPLICATED IT'S IT'S MULTI VARIANT THERE'S MANY MANY FACTORS THAT GO INTO DETERMINING YOUR ELIGIBILITY FOR CAL FRESH IT'S NOT JUST SIMPLY WHETHER YOUR STUDENT AND YOU MEET THE INCOME GUIDELINES RIGHT. IT'S A FULL. PROCESS THAT STUDENTS HAVE TO GO THROUGH -- I THINK IT TAKES TIME FOR CHANGES. OF THIS MAGNITUDE TO REALLY -- COME FULL CIRCLE WITHTHE FRONT LINE WE CAN WORK ON THAT. THE YEAR AND A HALF LONG ENOUGH -- I'D LIKE TO KNOW HOW WE MOVE THIS THING ALONG I MEAN IT'S CAL FRESHEN SNAPPER NOT WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF THIS BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE RIGHT I KNOW WHOSE COMMITTEE THEY ARE. I WOULD SAY JUST IN FAIRNESS TO THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES THEY'VE BEEN VERY VERY PROACTIVE ABOUT WORKING WITH THE DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA -- THEY'VE REALLY ARE WORKING DILIGENTLY TOWARDS DEVELOPING STUDENT FRIENDLY POLICIES THAT STAY WITHIN THE GUIDELINES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE SNAP IS A FEDERALLY GOVERNED PROGRAM. IN TERMS OF ELIGIBILITY. CURTIS AND AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EMPHASIZE THE DISTINCTION THERE PROBABLY TWO BUCKETS OF ISSUES THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH ONE THAT IS UP DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS USED TO GET BENEFITS AND ARE IN NEED. COLLEEN AND COLLEAGUES ARE WORKING VERY HARD ON THAT THERE ARE ALSO POLICY PRESUMPTIONS THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR STUDENTS. TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR BENEFITS AND AND THE WORK THAT COLLINS MENTIONED WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS THERE BUT THERE IS. I THINK A A NEED TO THINK ABOUT POLICIES IN THIS AEA TWO ABOUT WHETHER WE HAVE HAD A THERE'S BEEN A LONG STANDING ASSUMPTION THAT IT WOULD BE -- STUDENTS IN GENERAL IF YOU'RE TAKING MORE THAN SIXTY UNITS WOULD NOT BE ELIGIBLE AND LESS YOU MET OTHER CRITERIA. WELL I GUESS WHAT I'M ASKING IS I MEAN I'D LIKE A LIST OF THINGS THAT NEED TO BE FIXED I MEAN. MY MATH IS CORRECT CORRECT IS A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE OR NOT SO YOUNG PEOPLE. WHO ARE HUNGRY? AND YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST INTOLERABLE. TO ME AND IF WE NEED TO MAKE POLICY CHANGES -- WE NEED TO MAKE THOSE POLICY CHANGES THAT WE CAN MAKE. IF WE NEED. TO INCREASE THE FUNDING TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. MOVING DOWN TO THE DISTRICTS. TO FUN NAVIGATORS TO HELP US STUDENTS NAVIGATE THIS PROCESS -- THEN I'D LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT IT BECAUSE I THINK OF ALL THE THINGS THAT WE DEAL WITH UP HERE -- INCLUDING ALL THOSE WHO WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT TODAY -- HUNGER IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS JUST NOT SOMETHING THAT I'M WILLING TO TOLERATE SO. AND I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE N. AS A BY THE WAY WITH THE HOUSING ASSISTANCE WE HAVEN'T. TALKED ABOUT THAT BUT I SUSPECT THERE'S A SIMILAR SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES THAT. THAT CREATE THIS GAP BETWEEN I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE LINK BETWEEN THIS AND THE PREVIOUS ITEM THAT BOTH FOOD AND HOUSING OR ITEMS IN THE COST OF ATTENDANCE THAT IS ADDRESSED BY FAN FINANCIAL AID. AS BETWEEN NINETY ONE WOULD CLOSE THAT GAP AND SO WE VERY FIRMLY BELIEVE THERE'S A LINK BETWEEN THESE ISSUES AND THAT STUDENTS. ARE WE CAN. HELP TO ADDRESS FOOD AND HOUSING AND SECURITY BY EXPANDING FINANCIAL AID FOR STUDENTS RIGHT. AND I'M FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE USE OF THE GENERAL FUND FOR THAT PURPOSE BUT THERE'S OTHER MONEY -- THAT I DO NOT INTEND TO LEAVE ON THE TABLE JUST BECAUSE THE BUREAUCRACY CAN'T MOVE FAST ENOUGH -- MAYBE. TO GET IT TO THE STUDENTS WHO NEEDED OR OR WE NEED TO MAKE POLICY CHANGES TO MAKE THOSE. STUDENTS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING FOOD AND HOUSING AND SECURITY. OF QUALIFIED TO RECEIVE THOSE BENEFITS. THANK YOU I THINK THE NAVIGATION PIECE ON PUBLIC BENEFIT AXIS IS IS. DEFINITELY WORTH RECOGNIZE OR WILL WE WILL VISIT REVISIT THAT -- WHEN WE GET DOWN? TO BREAST TAX AROUND HERE I DIDN'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT YOU MELLOW THAT'S FINE [inaudible] NO APOLOGIES -- SO WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF FINANCIALLY REFORM IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF STUDENT FRIENDLY POLICIES THANK YOU -- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ON THAT PARTICULAR ITEM IN REGARD TO THE HOUSING IT'S A SIMILAR SCENARIO WHERE THE RULES THAT GOVERN HOUSING AND HOMELESS RESOURCES -- THEY ARE TRADITIONALLY FOCUSED ON PEOPLE WHO ARE CONCISE ARE MORE -- OUR HOMELESS CHRONIC HOMELESS PEOPLE STUDENTS AREN'T NECESSARILY. IDENTIFIED AS HOMELESS THE THE THE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE COUCH SURFING OR LISTENING OR SLEEPING IN THEIR CAR OR SLEEPING IN THEIR CAR. SO WHAT WE KNOW WITHIN THE I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A PROCESS HERE. FIRST FLOOR OF PURE. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU DO AND WHAT YOU. WHICH CAN DO WHAT YOU DO DO AND WHAT YOU CAN'T DO. BUT IS SOMEBODY GOING TO SUGGEST SOME CHANGES TO THIS PROCESS SO WE CAN ADDRESS THESE ISSUES UP HERE OR ARE YOU ALL GOING TO RELY ON PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO MAY NOT KNOW ENOUGH. TO DESIGN A CHANGE WE DO HAVE AND WE DO HAVE A WORK GROUP THAT IS CALLED THE STUDENT ELIGIBILITY WORKGROUP AND IT CONSISTS OF A NUMBER OF STAKEHOLDERS PEOPLE FROM THE FOOD BANK PEOPLE FROM ALL SECTORS OF EDUCATION PEOPLE FROM THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES. AND OUR SOLE CHARGE IS TO LOOK AT POLICIES AND PRACTICES AROUND HOW TO STUDENTS GET ON THE COW FRESH AND POSSIBLY OTHER PUBLIC BENEFITS -- AND SO I THINK THAT GROUP WOULD BE THE BEST GROUP TO TRY TO FORWARD SOME RECOMMENDATIONS IF. I LOOK FORWARD TO RECEIVING THEM. WHETHER THEIR BUDGET RELATED OR NOT IF THEY'RE NOT I'LL PASS THEMON TO THE PEOPLE WHO DEAL WITH THOSE ISSUES AND IF THEIR BUDGET RELATED -- I KNOW WERE TO TAKE THOSE [inaudible] THANK YOU. SO I HAVE ANOTHER ITEM ON NOT TRIVIALIZE YOU TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT -- SO FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES JUST A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND INFORMATION CURRENTLY ACROSS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM WE HAVE. SEVENTY A BRICK AND MORTAR HEALTH CENTERS -- MANY OF WHOM PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO STUDENTS -- SOME OF THE COLLEGES HAVE STANDALONE PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES AND BASED ON RESEARCH THAT WE CONDUCTED IN -- TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN PRIOR TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS BECAUSE WE DID RECEIVE. TEN WE RECEIVED FOUR AND A HALF MILLION IN THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET AND TEN MILLION IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO STUDENTS -- BUT JUST AS A LITTLE BACKGROUND -- SOME OF THE COLLEGES HAVE STANDALONE PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES ON CAMPUS -- BASED ON RESEARCH THAT WE DID WE IDENTIFIED NINETY OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT WERE OFFERING SOME LEVEL OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO THEIR STUDENTS -- IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY NINE I JUST MENTIONED WE GOT FOUR AND A HALF MILLION -- THE DELIVERABLES FOR THOSE FUNDS INCLUDED PROVIDING DIRECT SERVICES TO STUDENTS PROVIDING FACULTY STAFF AND STUDENTS WITH TRAINING ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH. SUICIDE PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION STRATEGIES FOR STUDENTS AND TO ESTABLISH FORMAL PARTNERSHIPS WITH COUNTY AND COMMUNITY BASED. A DIRECT SERVICE PROVIDERS -- FOR STUDENTS WHOSE -- MEANT MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS OF WENT BEYOND WHAT THE COLLEGE WAS ABLE TO PROVIDE IN TERMS OF ASSISTANCE -- WE DID FOR THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN DOLLARS WE DID A COMPETITIVE RFA PROCESS -- THESE FUNDS WERE MADE AWARE OF THE AWARDS WERE MADE TO FIFTEEN DISTRICTS ENCOMPASSING TWENTY SEVEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THIS IS FOR THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN FUNDS -- THE GRANTS RANGED FROM 200-500-0023 HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND AND THE COLLEGES WERE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR MATCH -- TO RECEIVE THESE GRANTS. A WE DID HAVE A FEW ADMINISTRATIVE DELAYS IN GETTING THE CONTRACTS IN PLACE THOUGH CURRENTLY ALL TWENTY SEVEN OF THOSE PARTICIPATING COLLEGES. ARE WELL INTO OPERATIONAL ICING THEIR FUNDS. AND FOR THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FUNDS WE DISTRIBUTED THOSE TWO ALL HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES THROUGH OUR PORTION IT PROCESS AND THOSE FUNDS WERE ALSO -- FOR THE SAME PURPOSES TO PROVIDE DIRECT SERVICES TO STUDENTS. TO PROVIDE TRAINING TO FACULTY STAFF AND STUDENTS AND TO CREATE FORMAL PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SO -- I WOULD SAY ALL THE COLLEGES HAVE PROTOCOL -- REGARDING CRISIS INTERVENTION FOR STUDENTS PRESENTING WITH IMMEDIATE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS. OF THE MAJORITY OF THE COLLEGES HAVE ESTABLISHED TEAMS ON CAMPUS TO ADDRESS STUDENTS IN NEED -- THEY'RE CALLED BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTION TEAMS ARE CRISIS INTERVENTION TEAMS -- THEN I'M NOT SURE A WAIT AND SEE IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS I HAVE ANSWERS TO WHAT I THINK MIGHT BE QUESTIONS BUT I REALIZE THAT EACH COMMUNITY COLLEGE IS A STANDALONE AND DISTURBED AS A STANDALONE ENTITY S. HERE. THE THE THE COLLEGES MAKE HEALTH INSURANCE AVAILABLE TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS TO SOME OF THEM ALL OF THEM NONE OF THEM. IT COVERS MENTAL HEALTH BUT HAS NO HEALTH COMPONENT TO IT THE COLLEGES DO NOT OFFER INSURANCE THE THE THERE'S A THEY DO WORK WITH VENDORS WHO CAN PROVIDE INSURANCE AND BUT THAT'S PRIMARILY TARGETING INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS WHO ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE. AS PART OF THEIR ENROLLMENT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. I THINK THE SCHOOLS -- DO WORK WITH THE STUDENTS TO HELP THEM GET ENROLLED IN A CGA AND MEDIC COW. BUT WE DON'T MAN DATE THAT -- THAT THEY HAVE INSURANCE I MEAN THE GOVERNMENT MANDATES THAT THEY HAVE INSURANCE BUT THE SCHOOLS DON'T. AND I REALIZE IT'S DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WAS INDIVIDUAL DISTRICTS WITH LOCAL GOVERNING BOARDS AND THIS AND THAT BUT IS THERE ANY CENTRALIZED COLLECTION OF DATA THAT THE ENABLES THE SYSTEM OFFICE FOR EXAMPLE TO EVALUATE WHETHER THE PROVISION. OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES -- THE NUMBER OF PROVIDERS ON CAMPUS THE WAIT TIMES -- AND ALL THE REST OF THAT THAT WE TAKE A LOOK AT AND YOU SEE IN THE C. ISSUES SEE ISSUE SYSTEM. THE THE THE THE THE DATA INDICATES THAT THERE IS A THERE ARE PROGRAMS IN PLACE THAT ARE MEETING THE NEEDS OF YOUR STUDENTS HOW HOW DO WE DO THAT -- FOR QUESTION -- IT'S A FAIR QUESTION I WOULD SAY WE ARE NOT DOING IT SYSTEMATICALLY TODAY WE HAVE FOLKS -- YOU KNOW WHO IT AND WE HAVE A REGULAR EXPENDITURE REPORTING SO IN MANY WAYS WE WOULD KNOW THE TYPES OF RESOURCES THAT ARE BEING PUT ON DIFFERENT PARTS OF CAMPUSES. WE KNOW THE TYPES OF EMPLOYEES THAT ARE SPREAD ACROSS CAMPUSES. WE HAPPENED HISTORICALLY DONE THE ANALYSIS. TO OB. TO LINK THAT TO STUDENT. TO STUDENT OUTCOMES THAT ARE OF INTEREST TO US OR AT LEAST STUDENT. EXPERIENCES THAT ARE INTEREST OF INTEREST TO US AND WE PROBABLY DON'T HAVE THE DATA ON A SYSTEMATIC BASIS. OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME AT A AT A LEVEL THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO DO THAT IN WAYS THAT WOULD BE INFORMATIVE TO POLICY MAKERS -- HERE THINK IT IS. IN CONJUNCTION WITH VARIOUS FUNDING SOURCES WE'VE ASKED FOR DATA -- BUT I THINK THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO A CAN OF CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU ABOUT ABOUT HOW WE DO IT HOW WHAT WHAT DATA SHOULD WE BE COLLECTING. MORE SYSTEMATICALLY TO GIVE US THE TYPES OF INSECTS THAT WOULD INFORM YOUR YOUR WORK MEANS SO IF IF FOR EXAMPLE IF THE IF WE WERE TO ASK DO YOU THINK THAT GIVEN THE THE INVESTMENT THAT THE STATE MAKES IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM THAT. WE'RE DOING ENOUGH TO ADDRESS THE MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS AND ISSUES OF OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. AS A QUESTION AND THE ANSWER WOULD BE I THINK WE HAVE LOTS OF EVIDENCE THAT -- OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE FACING ISSUES RELATED TO MENTAL HEALTH I DON'T THINK WE BUT I I I DEALT TO THE QUESTION OF ARE WE DOING ENOUGH I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE -- A GOOD SENSE -- OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME -- OUTSIDE OF THE DATA THAT COLLEEN COLLECTS AND AND I WE'VE SHARED -- ABOUT -- WHAT TRENDS LOOK LIKE WHAT SPECIFICALLY? VARIES ACROSS COLLEGES I'M SO I THINK IT TODAY. WE ARE TRYING TO YOU KNOW WE TRY TO MAKE DO WITH THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE BUT CERTAINLY -- I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE SYSTEMATIC ANSWERS FOR THOSE KINDS OF QUESTIONS FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE EXTREME AND DO WE KNOW SUICIDE RATES. WE DO NOT. SO ONE OF MY CONCERNS IS MEAN THAT THERE'S A HIGH DEGREE OF STRESS IN EDUCATION AT ALL LEVELS FROM. I GUESS ALMOST PRE. TO THE END OF THE LINE ON IT AT HIGHER EDUCATION -- WE'RE IN IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SETTING IT SOUNDS LIKE WE AND I'M INCLUDING THE LEGISLATURE IN THIS CONVERSATION. WE ARE SORT OF ALLOWING OR FORCING -- STUDENTS AND STUDENT GROUPS. TO INTERACT WITH LOCALLY ELECTED BOARDS TO TRY TO GET LOCALLY ELECTED BOARDS TO DO THE RIGHT THING. COLLECT DATA RESPONDED DATA. INPUT PROGRAMS IN PLACE AND SERVE A PIECEMEAL BASIS AROUND THE STATE AND AND I DO UNDERSTAND THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE SYSTEM THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH BUT PERHAPS WE OUGHT TO HAVE A CONVERSATION UP HERE. ABOUT A MORE REGULARIZED APPROACH. TO MENTAL HEALTH AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUSES AND OBVIOUSLY THAT. AS WITH EVERYTHING ELSE INCLUDES MONEY BUT IT ALSO INCLUDES HAVING SOME SORT OF DATA SYSTEMS SO WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHO'S DOING WHAT WHERE. WE'RE DEFICIENCIES OCCUR ARE ARE OCCURRING AND HOW WE DIRECT MONEY -- TO THOSE AREAS TO THOSE DISTRICTS TO THOSE REGIONS THAT HAVE. NEEDS THAT ARE BEING MET AND IT'S SORT OF HARD TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. IF WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FOR OR YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEMS ARE AND THAT'S NOT YOUR FAULT WE PROBABLY HAVEN'T FUNDED YOU. TO TO DO THAT I'D LIKE TO TALK TO THE SYSTEM AND THE CHANCELLOR ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO GET A BETTER HANDLE. ON A MENTAL HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH OF OUR STUDENTS AND OUR OWNER COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUSES. AND WHAT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IF ANY WE NEED TO DIRECT DOWN THERE. TO ADDRESS THOSE WERE DOING IT WAS THE ISSUE WERE DOING THE UC MEDICALLY DIFFERENT SYSTEMS. DIFFERENT ARCHITECTURE EASIER TO GET DATA. BUT I DO THINK WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS AND I THINK WORKING WITH -- WITH THOSE DISTRICTS UP FOR US WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION ALSO TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT CONVERSATION IS LOCALLY WHAT THE PRESSURES -- DISTRICTS ARE FACING AND AND HOW DO WE MAKE THIS A PRIORITY FOR DISTRICTS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ADDRESS -- AT THE LOCAL LEVELS RIGHT. THERE'S A FEW ITEMS THAT I JUST WANT TO SHARE AND I DON'T HAVE THAT IN FRONT OF ME BUT WE DO HAVE SOME STATISTICS FROM RAND -- WHO DID A STUDY OF OUR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENT HEALTH PROGRAM WHICH WAS FUNDED THROUGH THE MEDICAL SERVICE ACT PROP SIXTY THREE DOLLARS? SO WE CAN PROVIDE SOME DATA IT'S NOT SYSTEM MY DATA. BUT IT DOES REFLECT I'M PRETTY HIGH RATES OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION THAT ARE IMPEDING THE STUDENTS ACADEMICALLY SO THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL -- I WOULD SAY ALSO COULD PROVIDE THAT DECIDE WHERE WOULD I GO TO REVIEWING -- AND SOMETHING ELSE I THINK IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT THERE IS AN ASSEMBLY BILL RIGHT NOW 1-689- WHICH WOULD ALLOW FOR THE USE OF PROPS SIXTY THREE FUNDS SPECIFICALLY FOR ALL -- THREE SEGMENTS OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND SO PREVIOUSLY YOU KNOW BACK IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WE DID HAVE GRANT MAKING PROCESS USING PROPS SIXTY THREE DOLLARS SPECIFICALLY FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS -- I JUST THINK IT'S IT'S THE IMPORTANT. THING TO LOOK AT THAT ARE AN HSA FUNDS ARE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE ACT FUNDS -- DOING THEIR SHARE -- TO SUPPORT CAN BE COLLEGE STUDENTS IN GENERAL AND SO WE HAVEN'T HAD THAT FUNDING FOR MANY MANY YEARS AND SO IT'S ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTEEN EIGHTY NINE WELL OF COURSE BUT BUT THE I THINK. MONEY IS A GOOD THING RIGHT AND THAT'S GOOD BUT I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE THE PROCESS IN THE ARCHITECTURE IN PLACE. TO ASSESS WHERE THE MONEY'S GOING MAKE SURE IT'S GOING TO THE RIGHT PLACE. GATHER SOME DATA ON HOW IT'S BEING UTILIZED AND THEN MAKE ADJUSTMENTS. TO ENSURE THAT THE THE MONEY'S BEING DIRECTED TO THE PROBLEM AREAS THAT'S ONE OF THE ISSUES WE HAVE WITH PROP SIXTY THREE RIGHT NOW. IN ALLOCATION TO COUNTIES. SOME SPEND IT SOME DON'T SOME HAVE NINE HUNDRED MILLION IN RESERVE SOME OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX MILLION IN RESERVE. SO THAT'S THE SITUATION THAT WE DON'T WANT TO REPLICATE. IN IN HIGHER EDUCATION WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MONEY GOES DOWN AND FIXES PROBLEMS AND YEAH AND AND THIS IS NOT COMING FROM A PERSPECTIVE OF OF DATA AND RESEARCH IT IS COMING FROM A PERSPECTIVE OF HAVING WORKED WITH THE HEALTH OF THE MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ACROSS. THE FIELD THERE IS A NEED WELL FIRST PLACES TO GET THE MONEY THE THE AUTHORITY TO USE THE MONEY. BUT THEN WE NEED TO WORK WITH YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S A PROCESS IN PLACE. TO FIGURE OUT WHERE IT NEEDS TO GO WHAT IT NEEDS TO DO AND THEN ASSESS THE RESULTS -- ONCE WE SET THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES EXCELLENT. WE'VE GOT SOME REPORTS DO THAT I THINK YOU'RE NOT. DO NOT IN YET SO YES WE HAVE -- WE HAVE A SERVICE OUT TO THE COLLEGES FOR BOTH THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN MENTAL HEALTH FUNING. AND WE'RE PROPOSING TO SUBMIT A REPORT TO YOU IN JULY JULY FIRST. LOOK FORWARD -- TO TO REVIEWING IT THANK YOU. ANYTHING FURTHER. EXCELLENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ISSUE NUMBER SIX IS THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM NEW FACE. SERVE YOUR DATA FOR YOURSELF FOR THE RECORD PLEASE SOLELY HI SENATOR ROUGH THAT MATTHEW ROBERTS SIGNED WITH THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES CHANCES OFFICE WORKING ON STRONG WORK FORCE IN K. TWELVE STRONG WORK FORCE THANK YOU THE JUDGE OR THE JOIN YOU DOWN IN RIVERSIDE EARLIER THIS YEAR FOR YOUR HEARING. SO YOU HEARD ALL MY QUESTIONS ARE ANY. OKAY IT WAS THE START. BE THINKING WITH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. I'LL BE SPEAKING FROM A HANDOUT THE SECTIONS ARE JUST DISTRIBUTED. I THINK I RECALL THIS FROM WORK FIRST PROGRAM GREW OUT OF A TASK FORCE THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES BOARD OF GOVERNORS COMMISSIONED IN. TWENTY FOURTEEN THIS TASK FORCE MADE A NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT STRENGTHENING CT ACROSS THE STATE INCLUDING RECOMMENDATION TO INCREASE LINE AND WITH REGIONAL WORK FOR SMITH. THE STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAMS CREATED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN WITH THE GOAL OF EXPANDING THE AVAILABILITY AND QUALITY OF C. T. PROGRAMS AND IMPROVING THAT REGIONAL LINES. CURRENTLY THE STATE PROVIDES TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT MILLION ON GOING FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES PORTION OF THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM. NOTABLY THIS FUNDING IS MEANT TO SUPPLEMENT THE APPORTIONMENT FUNDING THAT THE STATE ALSO PROVIDES IS GENERAL PURPOSE FUNDS FOR CITY AND OTHER INSTRUCTION. THE INTENT HERE IS TO PROVIDE SOME SUPPLEMENTAL RESOURCES FOR HIGHER INSTRUCTIONAL COSTS THAT SOMETIMES COME WITH CTE COURSES. AND ALSO TO SUPPORT THE REGIONAL PLANNING AND COORDINATION REQUIRED UNDER THIS PROGRAM. ON THE SECOND PAGE OF OUR HAND OUT WE OUTLINED IN BRIEF WITHOUT REGIONAL PLANNING COORDINATION CONSISTS OF ACROSS THE STATE THERE ARE EIGHT REGIONAL CONSORTIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THESE COLLEGES IN THEIR CONSORTIA REQUIRED TO COOPERATE WITH VARIOUS REGIONAL STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES AND INDUSTRY LEADERS. TO IDENTIFY REGIONAL NEEDS AND DEVELOP FOR YOUR PLANS. THE CONSORTIUM ALSO REQUIRED HIS LABOR MARKET DATA TIED ON A FIVE PRIORITY INDUSTRY SECTORS WITHIN THE REGION. ON WHICH TO CONCENTRATE THEIR SPENDING. STATE FUNDING FOR THE RECENT RESULTS FOR SURE. IS ALLOCATED ACCORDING TO A FORMULA THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT ENROLLMENT WITHIN THE REGIONS AS WELL AS THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WITHIN THE REGIONS. AND THAT'S A TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THERE'S ALSO PERFORMANCE COMPONENT OF THAT FUNDING FORMULA. FINALLY THE BOTTOM FOR HAND OUT WE BRIEFLY EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENS THE FUNDS ONCE THEY REACH THE CONSORTIA. 60% OF THE FUNDS ARE DIRECTLY ALLOCATED TO THE DISTRICTS. WHERE IS THE OTHER 40% ARE GIVEN TO THE CONSORTIUM WHICH HAVE DISCRETION TO SPEND THEM ON INDUSTRY PRIORITIES? THANK YOU I'D BE HAPPY TO QUESTION [inaudible] NEXT. GOOD AFTERNOON NOW. BUT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET CONTINUES TO PROVIDE TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT MILLION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FIND. FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAM FOR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY WHICH IS THE SAME LEVEL OF FUNDING AS FOR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET MADE A TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT TO SWAP SOME OF THE ALLOCATION FOR RE APPROPRIATED AND SETTLE UP FUNDS TO REFLECT AVAILABLE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL. FUND. AT THE TIME OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. WE WILL BE MONITORING REVENUES IN THE LEVEL OF MINIMUM CARE AND AND THE LEVEL OF THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE AS WE APPROACH THE MAY REVISION. BUT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO FUND THE STRONG WORK FIRST PROGRAM AT ITS CURRENT LEVEL. THANK YOU AND HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. MORNING AGAIN GOOD AFTERNOON SORRY -- MATTHEW ROBERTS. SO WE'RE GOING TO OPERATE FROM PAGE THIRTY TWO BEGINNING ON PAGE THIRTY TWO OF YOUR HAND. THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME. ALREADY IT'S BEEN PRESENTED TODAY THE STRUCTURE OF THE STRONG WORK PROGRAM -- AS IT ROLLED OUT IN NINETEEN SIXTEEN PART SORRY. EIGHTEEN SIXTY SEVEN IT WAS WHEN I WAS BORED. SORRY NINETEEN SIXTEEN YELLING THE EXACTLY EXACTLY EXACTLY IN OUR THIRD YEAR OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM -- AS WAS EXPLAINED 60% OF THE TWO HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT MILLION -- GOES OUT -- TO THE DISTRICTS DIRECTLY TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS TO CREATE MORE AND BETTER SEE TV PROGRAMS. A 40% OF THOSE DOLLARS OF THE TWO HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT MILLION TRICKLE DIRECTLY INTO OUR REGION. TO TAKE CARE OF REGIONAL NEEDS AND REGIONAL PRIORITIES THAT ARE DRIVEN BY THE ECONOMICS OF THAT PARTICULAR AREA -- AND SO WE'RE HAPPY WITH. ROLLING INTO THE THIRD YEAR. LOOKING AT SOME OF THE SOME OF THE GAINS THAT WE'VE HAD. IN TERMS OF OUTCOME SO I WANT TO GO OVER THOSE IN JUST A COUPLE OF MINUTES. I THINK THE WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING THOUGH IS IS REALLY DESIGNED TO REDUCE A LOT OF THE DUPLICATION THAT'S CURRENTLY EXISTING WITHIN OUR SYSTEMS. TO CROSS OVER TO ENSURE THE DOLLARS ARE ARE BEING USED IN BRAIDED LEVERAGE IN SUCH A WAY THAT REALLY MOVES STUDENTS FOR THE BEST IN THE BEST WAY TO THAT CAREER -- A GOAL -- AND CERTAINLY WHAT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT TODAY IN TERMS OF THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS RIGHT IN TERMS OF ATTAINING A LIVING WAGE. IN TERMS OF INSURING THAT STUDENTS ARE ARE MOVING THROUGH SO WE'VE IDENTIFIED CERTAIN TYPES OF STUDENTS THAT THAT -- ARE THE RECIPIENTS OF THESE DOLLARS AND IT'S IMPORTANT I THINK TO NOTE THAT IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. 78% OF CALIFORNIA'S ASSOCIATES DEGREE -- HALF OF WHICH WERE IN PROGRAMS THAT WERE DESIGNED FOR C. T. E. OR SOME SORT OF A C. T.. AND THE NUMBERS -- IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF COURSES THAT ARE OFFERED THE NUMBER OF FACULTY THAT ARE ENGAGED IN CTE COURSES IS HIGH AS WELL -- AND SO WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT STUDENTS THAT ARE COMPLETING IN OTHER WORDS LOOKING AT OUR STUDENTS ATTAINING THAT LIVABLE WAGE. ARE THEY TO ACHIEVING A CERTIFICATE OF SOME SORT THAT'S OF VALUE -- TO INDUSTRY IN BUSINESS OR ARE THEY STARTED MOVING ON TO THE NEXT LEVEL OF THEIR CAREER. WE KNOW FULL WELL THAT STUDENTS ARE NOT GONNA HAVE THE SAME CAREER THEIR ENTIRE LIFE AND SO. IT'S THE IMPORTANCE OF US CREATING PROGRAMS THAT SORT OF STACK. THAT'S SORT OF A CREATE THAT PIPELINE -- TO MOVE THINGS FORWARD AND SO -- A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING WE'RE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW OR THE SHORT TERM A C. T. E. CERTIFICATES AND HOW DO WE MOVE OUR OUR STUDENTS THAT MAYBE COME BACK. IN FOR ONE OR TWO COURSES -- TO SORT OF UP SKILL OR TO GET A RAISE OR TO TO MOVE FORWARD -- SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THOSE STUDENTS AS WELL. THEY ALSO LOOK AT THE THE LEVEL OF ONBOARDING OFF BOARDING THAT OTHER PROGRAMS PROVIDE SUCH AS THROUGH GUIDED PATHWAYS. ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAMS THOSE TYPES OF THINGS WE PRESENT SOME DATA TO YOU IN TERMS OF OUTCOMES BECAUSE I THINK THAT THIS IS. THIS IS REALLY WHAT THE PROGRAM IS PREDICATED ON RIGHT IS CAN WE ACHIEVE THE TYPES OF STUDENT OUTCOMES AND PROGRAM OUTCOMES TO REALLY MOVE THE NEEDLE -- SERVER. PRESENT SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN MOVING FORWARD ONCE THAT FOR THE FUNDS WERE IMPLEMENTED. THE NUMBER OF F. T. S. OR STUDENTS A FULL TIME STUDENT EQUIVALENT IN THE SYSTEM INCREASED. FOR C. T.. BY ABOUT FORTY FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS IN JUST ONE YEAR AND SO WE ARE SEEING SORT OF AN UP TICK. IN THIS IS JUXTAPOZ WE THINK WITH A LARGER DECLINE SYSTEM WIDE -- BOTH ON THE K. TWELVE AND THE THE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SIDE -- SO WE'RE HAPPY TO SEE SORT OF THAT UP TAKE MAKING STUDENTS. MAKE SURE STEVE'S CONNECT TO THEIR PROGRAMS. ANOTHER ONE THAT -- PRESENT TO YOU IS EARNING CERTIFICATES OVER TIME THAT'S ANOTHER METRIC THAT HIS INCREASED. WE WENT IN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN FROM. SEVENTY TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED DEGREES AND CERTIFICATES TO ABOUT SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED DEGREES AND CERTIFICATES IN ONE YEAR SO WE'RE DEFINITELY SAYING THE THE UPTICK IN TERMS OF THE WHAT ARE THEIR THEIR CREDENTIALS ARE THE REQUIREMENTS THAT A STUDENT WILL NEED TO START AGAIN THAT EMPLOYMENT AND MOVE. FORWARD LET ME GO FORWARD HERE -- LOOKING AT MEDIAN ANNUAL EARNINGS OF SHORT TERM CAREER EDUCATION STUDENTS AGAIN IMPLEMENTED. THE THE MEDIAN ANNUAL INCOME WENT UP FROM THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND TO FORTY TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SO THAT WAS A DEFINITE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE. WE'RE LOOKING TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT HAPPENS -- THE THE NOTION OF MAKING THIS PROGRAM TRANSPARENT ENOUGH TO WHERE WE ARE GATHERING THE INPUT FROM BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY MAKING SURE THAT THOSE JOBS ARE SORT OF ADDED. ESPECIALLY THE ONES THAT ARE GOING TO MOVE STUDENTS INTO INTO WHERE WE WANT THEM TO BE -- ANOTHER ONE FOR MEDIA AND CHANGE AND SHORT TERM CAREER EDUCATION EARNINGS. IT WENT UP FROM. FIFTEEN SIXTEEN TO SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN FROM 51% SORT OF ATTRIBUTES COMING FORWARD IN THE PROGRAM. I HAVE TO SAY THAT WHEN WE WHEN WE PULL THE REGION. AND WE PULL THE COLLEGES AND HOW THINGS ARE GOING -- THE BIGGEST IMPACT IS THE AMOUNT OF ATTENTION THAT C. T. E. AND WORK FORCES SORT OF RECEIVING AND AND AND BY THAT. IT'S IT'S SORT OF MOVING THE NEEDLE IT'S HELPING US TO MOVE THE NEEDLE -- TO SORT OF ON BOARD WITH OUR OTHER PROGRAMS SUCH AS GUIDED PATHWAYS -- SEE WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY ASK A QUESTION YEAH SURE GO FOR BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY THE EDUCATION PIECE OBVIOUSLY IS WORKING I MEAN YOU'RE. CALCULATING THE NUMBER OF DEGREES AND CERTIFICATES AT YOU KNOW YOU PRODUCE SURE SOMEHOW ABLE TO ME AT LEAST ON SOME GENERAL LEVEL. CONNECT -- THOSE WITH WHAT -- INCOME IS DOING IN TERMS FOR THE IN TERMS OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MOVING THROUGH BUT RIGHT. YOU FOR MY QUESTIONS BEFORE AND YOU PROBABLY HEARD THEM IN RIVERSIDE. WHAT I DON'T [inaudible] QUITE UNDERSTAND. AND I'M NOT SURE THAT THIS PEACE WORKS AS WELL IS THE DEMAND SIDE FOR EXAMPLE IN THE IN THE ANALYSIS IT SAYS THE IN INLAND EMPIRE DESERT OF REGIONS OF THE STATE THE PROPERTY IN EMERGING SECTORS ARE. ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION AND LOGISTICS OKAY I GET THAT. AND SOMEWHERE ELSE I'LL PROBABLY FIND THAT THERE. TWENTY THOUSAND PROJECTED TO BE TWENTY THOUSAND JOBS IN THAT IN THAT SECTOR OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. AND SO I SAY WELL WHAT DOES THAT REALLY MEAN WHAT HOW WOULD YOU DESIGN A TRAINING PROGRAM. TO NEXT NECESSARILY TRAINED JOE FOR A JOB IN ADVANCE TRANSPORTATION AND LOGISTICS IF YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE JOB IS YOU KNOW REALLY KNOW WHAT THE SKILL SET IS. WAY FOR TALKING ABOUT C. T. RIGHT AND SO IT SEEMS TO ME THERE NEEDS TO BE A MUCH MORE ORGANIZED APPROACH TO THIS WHETHER WE RELY ON THE ONLINE. COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOLKS TO SET UP THE ARCHITECTURE AND THEN LETTING IT LATER AND ON ALL THE REST OF US. AROUND THE STATE OR DO IT SOME OTHER WAY BUT SOMEBODY SOME ENTITY NEEDS TO BE THE POINT OF CONTACT WITH EMPLOYERS. IN IN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE OR THE CENTRAL VALLEY SO IF I'M -- UTC OR WHATEVER THEY'RE CALLED THE DAILY -- ROAR INDUSTRIES AND I'M MAKING ENGINE THIS SELLS FOR BOEING SEVEN TRIPLE SEVENS AND SEVEN THIRTY SEVENS AND I NEED A CERTAIN. HONEY COMB -- AUTOCLAVE OPERATOR THAT NEEDS THESE SORT OF SKILLS I CAN PICK UP THE PHONE AND I KNOW TO CALL. THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD IN RIVERSIDE SAN BENITO COUNTY AND SAY I NEED TEN OF THESE PEOPLE. AND THEY THEN THE BOARD THEN TURNS TO THE CONSORTIUM DOWN THERE AND SAYS I NEED WE NEED TEN OF THESE. PEOPLE TODAY AND WE'RE PROBABLY-GOING TO NEED A HUNDRED OF THEM OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. AND THESE ARE THE SKILL SETS. FIGURE THIS OUT AND TELL ME WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO HELP BUT AN INDUSTRY TO INDUSTRY. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE AND IT'S YOU'RE DESCRIBING A MODEL FOR WHICH WE DO UTILIZE AN IMPLEMENT UNDER EW DE IT. THE WD PROGRAM AND THAT'S THE SECTOR EXPERTS THAT WE DO PUT OUT INTO THE FIELD. THEIR JOB IS TO IS TO RESPOND QUICKLY TO THE NEEDS OF INDUSTRY THE SAY A PARTNER COMES TO THEM AND OR TO A COLLEGE AND SAYS. WE NEED X. NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO DO THIS FOR WE NEED THIS DONE. THAT POSITION IS DESIGNED TO SORT OF MAKE THAT CONNECTION SO THEY'RE THE INDUSTRY PARTNER EXPERT. THAT'S DESIGNED TO TO SORT OF INTERFACE WITH THAT WHAT MUST BE A MARKETING PROBLEM AND BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU MAY RECALL WHEN I WAS IN WHEN WE WERE ALL IN RIVERSIDE AND I ASKED THE I WILL. CALL F THE ENTITY BUT I ASK AN ENTITY THAT WAS ON THE IN THE HOT SEAT. ANSWERING MY QUESTIONS IF I'M AN EMPLOYER AND I NEED TO GO TO TALK TO SOMEBODY TO LET YOU KNOW THAT I HAVE A PARTICULAR NEED FOR A HUNDRED ACTS WHATEVER AXES RIGHT. WHO WOULD I GO TO AND THESE PEOPLE WHO SHOULD KNOW IS THAT I DON'T KNOW? THAT NOW THAT YEAH. IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM AND THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM THAT THE EDUCATION PIECE HAS. THAT'S A PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE OVER HERE AND WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THE OVER HERE BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE YOU PRETTY MUCH HAVE YOUR STUFF TOGETHER. BRIDGING THE DIVIDE YEAH IT'S ABOUT HOW DO YOU SORT OF MAKE THAT CONNECTION YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT AND HOW TO UTILIZE DATA OTHER THAN THE LABOR MARKET INFORMATION ON SUPPLY AND DEMAND BECAUSE IT'S GENERAL IT'S JUST IT'S BACKWARDS FACING YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT -- YOU DO YOU NEED THE EMPLOYER ENGAGED AND THAT'S THAT'S THE WITH SOME OF THE ADVISORIES I THINK SO BUT BUT BUT THE EMPLOYER BUT THE ITSELF BY SAY MARKETING PERHAPS THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT TERM [inaudible] INFORMATION DISSEMINATION BUT THE EMPLOYER COMPLETE COMMUNITY UP AND DOWN THE STATE NEEDS TO KNOW. AND THAT'S WHY IT ALMOST HAS TO BE THE SAME ENTITY -- ON A REGIONAL BASIS UP AND DOWN THE STATE THE EMPLOYER COMMUNITY NEEDS TO KNOW THAT IF I HAVE A NEED. I'M GONNA GO HERE RIGHT AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE THE INVENTORY REPOSITORY REPOSITORY OF JOBS AND JOB SKILL INFORMATION. THAT THEN THE CONSORTIA CAN TURN TO TO DESIGN TRAINING PROGRAMS TO MEET THOSE NEEDS. SO I I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN IF I'M RIGHT. I'M NOT IN MY HEAD SO YES. GOOD CHRISTIAN GREY COMPLETELY THANK YOU. I KNOW THANK YOU. I DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE. IF THAT WAS THE QUESTION I DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE ANY ANY MORE OF THEM AND IF IT WAS A STATEMENT I DON'T THINK I HAVE ANY MORE OF THEM THOSE EITHER SO YOU KNOW WHERE TO REACH US IF YOU HAVE OTHER QUESTIONS. I GUESS I SHOULD ASK WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK THE FOR THE GRIP IS THIS ON PAGE THIRTY SIX OF THE ANALYSIS. IN THIS TO SOME EXTENT THE THIRTY SEVEN C. D. E. F. T. E.'S. JUST TAKE IN THE NAME PER DESERT WHAT WHY IS THERE A DECREASE. THAT MAKES SENSE THE QUESTION. ITHINK I WOULD JUST MAYBE OF MAKE IT MORE GENERAL STATEMENT THAT -- AS WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE FIRST PANEL ENROLLMENT GROWTH HAS BEEN SLOW -- IN ME -- STATEWIDE IN SUMMARY -- AND REGIONS IS DECREASING YOU SEE DECLINES IN K. TWELVE ENROLLMENT YOU SEE A WE SEE A TREND WHEN LABOR MARKETS ARE ARE BETTER STUDENTS ARE LESS LIKELY TO ENROLL IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO I YOU KNOW I THINK WE WOULD ARGUE IN PART IT IS. A REFLECTIVE OF AN OVERALL TREND AS A DEAN ROBERTS NOTED -- YOU KNOW MMHM MOST OF OUR FTS MY MUCH OF OUR FTS IS IN C. T. ANYWAY AND SO I THINK THAT'S I I THINK WE'VE -- YOU KNOW AND LOOKING INTO IT -- ONE OF OUR INITIAL THOUGHTS IS THAT IT'S JUST REFLECTIVE OF THESE DEMOGRAPHICS OKAY. WELL AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION GREAT WORK KEEP IT UP I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THAT OTHER LITTLE PIECE THAT I MENTIONED WOULD LOVE IT THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU. OKAY LET'S MOVE ON WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT ITEM SIXTY ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT SEVENTY CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. ISSUE SEVEN IS K. TWELVE CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS -- MY WATCH JUST TELL ME THAT WE'RE ALMOST THERE SO THAT'S A GOOD THING. LET'S -- ADDENDA FIRES CELLS FOR THE RECORD STARTING TO MY LEFT. AMBER ALEXANDER WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. LENA GRANT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. BRIAN ANDERSON LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. MATTHEW ROBERTS FROM THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. OKAY [inaudible] YES MA'AM. MICHELLE MACINTOSH HEALTH FOR DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IS BACK BECAUSE THANK YOU WHO WANTS -- TO IT WAS THE START. I'LL START -- SO OUR OFFICE PROCESS SAID PROVIDE JUST A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF HIGH SCHOOL CT. I'M GONNA BE SPEAKING FROM A HANDOUT THEYPUT THE SERGEANT JUST. DISTRIBUTED -- ON THE FIRST PAGE OF THIS HANDOUT JUST A REMINDER THAT. THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION IS ORGANIZED -- ALL INDUSTRIES IN THE STATE AND THE FIFTEEN DIFFERENT SECTORS AND FOR EACH OF THESE SECTORS THEY'VE DEVELOPED THE SPECIFIC. I'M SORRY YEAH THIS IS. THAT'S THE ONE YOUR YOU KNOW I GO TO THE PICTURES HEY IF. YOU EMAIL ACCOUNT WHATEVER HELPS YOU. AND FOR EACH OF THESE INDUSTRY SECTORS THE STATE HAS DEVELOPED A SPECIFIC CURRICULUM AND PATHWAY FOR STUDENTS INTERESTED IN CAREERS IN THAT SECTOR. SECOND PAGE JUST TALKS ABOUT THE OBJECTIVES OF PROVIDING CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND SURE IF YOU VISITED HIGH SCHOOL SEE TV PROGRAMS IN YOUR DISTRICT. LOT OF THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING THEIR LOOKS VERY DIFFERENT FROM A TRADITIONAL HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM BUT FACT THE OBJECTIVES OF THOSE PROGRAMS HEARD QUITE COURTS TO THE MISSION OF K. TWELVE THEY INCLUDE. PROMOTING STUDENT ENGAGEMENT SOME STUDENTS HERE JUST FOR INTEREST IN SCHOOL WHEN THEY CAN DO SOMETHING PRACTICAL THAT THEY CAN SEE LEADS TO A FUTURE CAREER -- AND ALSO TEACHING SOFT SKILLS SHOWING UP ON TIME WORKING IN TEAMS. AND OF COURSE HELPING THE STATE MEET ITS WORK FOR SCHOOLS. ON PAGE THREE WE TALK ABOUT THE STATE'S APPROACH TO SUPPORTING CREATE TECHNICAL EDUCATION. THIS WORK WITH THE STATE HAS SUPPORTED -- CT THROW A COMBINATION OF CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS AT PRIOR TO TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN FOURTEEN WHICH IS TO SAY PRIOR TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. THE LARGEST OF THESE PROGRAMS WAS A REGIONAL OCCUPATIONAL CENTERS AND PROGRAMS ARE OVER ROC PEAS -- AT THEIR HEIGHT THEY RECEIVED ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR -- THIS PROGRAM ALONG WITH MANY OTHERS WAS ROLLED INTO ELSE EFF. AND FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS FROM EIGHTEEN HIGH SCHOOL CTU WAS. SUPPORTED BY A COMBINATION OF THE FUNDS PROVIDED UNDER L. C. F. F. L. C. F. F. INCLUDED -- BUMPED TO THE HIGH SCHOOL BASE RATE WHICH WAS INTENDED IN PART. TO ACCOUNT FOR THE HIGHER COST OF PROVIDING C. T. PROGRAMS AND ALSO SOME LIMITED TERM A CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS. UGH THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF WHICH WAS THE CT INCENTIVE GRANT THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT PROVIDED. YOU'RE OVER YEAR DECREASING STATE FUNDING AND AN INCREASING LOCAL MATCH TO GO ALONG. NOW IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WHEN THE C. T. INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM WAS -- SET TO EXPIRE THERE IS INTEREST IN AMONG BOTH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION AND CONTINUING TO SUPPORT HIGH SCHOOL CT THROWED. CATEGORICAL APPROACH THERE IS SOME DISAGREEMENT ABOUT EXACTLY HOW THAT CATEGORICAL APPROACH SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED WHAT WE ENDED UP WITH WORD TWO LARGE ON GOING PROGRAMS. OF ONE ADMINISTERED BY THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THE OTHER BY THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. THE ONE ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WAS A CONTINUATION OF THE CITY INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM. RECEIVES A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY AND SUPPORTED ON COMPETITIVE BASIS -- APPLICANTS ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE TO LOCAL DOLLARS FOR EVERY ONE DOLLAR AND DEDICATED STATE FUNDING THAT THEY RECEIVE. THE OTHER PROGRAM WHICH IS ADMINISTERED BY THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES WAS. A K. TWELVE COMPONENT. ON THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM THAT WE JUST HEARD ABOUT SO THE FINDING HERE IS DISTRIBUTED -- FIRST AS A FORMULA TO THE VARIOUS -- CONSORTIA THAT WE DISCUSSED EARLIER A TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION ON GOING THOSE CONSORTIA THAN AWARD THE FUNDING I GET A COMPETITIVE BASIS SAID OF THE ACE IN THEIR AREA -- AGAIN FOR MOST APPLICANTS THERE'S A TWO TO ONE LOCAL MATCH FOR THIS PROGRAM. FOUND ON PAGE FOUR WE DISCUSS -- IN ADDITION TO THE CATEGORICAL FUNDING THE STATE SIR. SIGNALS ITS SUPPORT FOR C. T. E. BY INCLUDING AND THE ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM THAT WAS ESTABLISHED UNDER L. CFF. ODD SO L. FF A WAS INTRODUCED READ REQUIRED ALL DISTRICTS. TO DEVELOP THE STRATEGIC PLANS THE PLACE SPECIFIC MARKERS FOR STUDENT OUTCOMES AND THEN DETAILED HOW THEY WOULD MEET THOSE MARKERS -- TO SEE THAT THESE PLANS ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED AND ARE SUCCESSFUL WE ALSO INTRODUCED RECENTLY THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DASHBOARD WHICH TRACES A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT INDICATORS AMONG WHICH IS THE COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS INDICATOR. THAT INDICATOR IS SPELLED OUT ON THE FINAL PAGE OF THE HANDOUT PAGE FIVE BUT THE IMPORTATION WAY HERE. IS THAT WHILE THE CITY IS NOT A NECESSARY COMPONENT OF THE COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS INDICATOR. IT IS ONE POTENTIAL COMPONENT STUDENTS CAN BE MARKED AS PREPARED. IF THEY BOTH RECEIVE A HIGH SCHOOL DEGREE AND COMPLETE ONE OF THE CAREER PATHWAYS THAT WE DISCUSSED EARLIER. NOW THE LATEST DASHBOARD DATA INDICATE THAT THE STATE STILL. HAS SOME WAY TO GO IN MEETING THIS -- GOAL -- SPECIFICALLY IT SHOWS THAT ABOUT 40% OF STUDENTS ARE MARKED AS PREPARED BY 20% ARE MARKED IS NEARING PREPARED THAT LEAVES 40% THEY'RE MARKED AS NOT PREPARED. THAT'S THE END OF MY INTRODUCTORYREMARK MARKS ALL HEADED OVER TO THE OTHERS WELL. DOES THAT MEAN THAT IF I LOOK AT THE DASHBOARD AND I SEE THAT. PARTICULAR DISTRICT ARE PREPARED. DOES THAT MEAN NECESSARILY THAT THEY WHEN THEY GET THEIR HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA THAT THEY HAVE A JOB. I KNOW IT DOES NOT A IT'S SUPPOSED TO INDICATE THAT THEY ARE PREPARED FOR EITHER COLLEGE OR CAREER BUT IT. IS DOES NOT NECESSARILY INDICATE THAT THEY'VE BEEN ACCEPTED IN EITHER FIELD SORT OF A DEFECT IN OUR DASH WORDS WELL I I I'LL LET THE PRESIDENT. TO THAT BUT IF. WE JUST SAY. THAT WAS A POOR CHOICE OF WORDS -- PREPSTAR DASH BOARD SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE ENHANCED IN ORDER TO MEASURE THE THE C. T.. PIECE OF CASE. TO TWELVE I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT QUESTION FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER. THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENTS OKAY OF AND WERE LOOKING YES MA'AM NEXT AT LEANA GRAHAM OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES AN ADDITIONAL TWO BILLION FOR THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. BRINGING TOOK TOTAL ELSE EFF FUNDING TO SIXTY THREE BILLION IN. NINETEEN TWENTY IN ADDITION AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO TWO POINT 6% OF THE L. CFF BASE GRANT IS PROVIDED. THROUGH THE NINTH THROUGH TWELFTH GRADE SPAN ADJUSTMENT TERM ACCOUNT FOR THE HIGHER COST OF PROVIDING CT PROGRAMS AT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL. THE SPACE GRANT ADJUSTMENT AMOUNTS TO APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION AN ONGOING FUNDING THAT HAS BEEN FILLED IN ON TOP OF THE LCF BASE. THEY CAN BE USED TO SUPPORT ROBUST CT PROGRAMS TO THE EXTENT THAT THOSE PROGRAMS ARE A LOCAL PRIORITY. FUNDING ALLOCATED THROUGH THE LC FF SHOULD PAY FOR A FULL RANGE OF EDUCATIONAL COSTS INCLUDING C. T. E.. BUT IN RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT HIGH QUALITY C. T. PROGRAMS PLAY ABOUT A VALUABLE ROLE IN PREPARING STUDENTS TO MEET THE STATE'S LABOR TO PARK IT DEMANDS. THE BUDGET MAINTAINS THE ONGOING INVESTMENTS THAT WERE AND NEGOTIATED AS PART OF THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET FOR BOTH THE CITY INCENTIVE. INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAMS YOU TAKE AND THE K. THROUGH TWELVE COMPONENT OF THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM. A DIFFICULT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION -- AN ONGOING PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING IS PROVIDED FOR LOCAL GRANTS TO K. THROUGH TWELVE ENTITIES UNDER EACH PROGRAM. AN ADDITIONAL TWELVE MILLION AN ONGOING PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING IS PROVIDED TO SUPPORT A REGIONAL LEADERSHIP STRUCTURED TO ASSIST TEACHERS AND INDUSTRY PARTNERS. IN IMPLEMENTING HIGH QUALITY C. T. PROGRAMS AS WELL AS TWO MILLION FUN PROVIDED TO SUPPORT REGIONALS REGIONAL COSTS ASSOCIATED. WITH ADMINISTERING THE K. THROUGH TWELVE COMPONENT OF THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM. THESE PROGRAMS ALONG WITH THE FUNDING PROVIDED THROUGH THE LC FF HELP ENSURE THAT STUDENTS HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO TO PARTICIPATE IN EFFECTIVE HIGH QUALITY C. T. PROGRAMS.% THAT ARE A LOT A LINE NOT ONLY WITH COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS STANDARDS. BUT ALSO WITH THE NEEDS OF EMPLOYERS INDUSTRY AND LABOR. FINALLY A NOTED IN THE AGENDA THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT MAKES SEVERAL TECHNICAL CHANGES. THE LANGUAGE GOVERNING BOTH PROGRAMS -- THESE CHANGES ARE PROPOSED IN RESPONSE TO RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WERE MADE BY THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE PATHWAYS JOINT ADVISORY COMMITTEE. AND FEEDBACK RECEIVED FROM OTHER STAKEHOLDERS -- I HAVE WITH ME AND AMBER ALEXANDER FROM FINANCE AND WE'RE HAPPY TO RESPOND TO ANY QUESTIONS. WELL GOOD AFTERNOON BUDGETARY ROCKED AND MEMBERS I MICHELLE MACINTOSH. pLEADERSHIP OFFICE TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF SUPERINTENDENT TONY THURMAN. AND I CAN'T SAY THAT C. T. E. IS INCLUDED IN THE DASHBOARD IS PART OF THE CAREER COMPONENT IF STUDENTS COMPLETE A SEQUENCE -- OF COURSES OF THREE HUNDRED HOURS OR MORE -- THAT IS WHAT MEASURES THAT'S ONE OF THE CURRENT MEASURES FOR AND THE DASHBOARD AT THIS TIME. I'M SO WE ARE PLEASED TO SEE THE GOVERNOR SUPPORT AS THE TAKE AND PROVIDING FUNDING INTO POSITIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE CAREER TECHNICAL. EDUCATION INCENTIVE GRANT UNDER THE SEA TAKE SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CREATE AND EXPAND PROGRAM CITY PROGRAMS DRIVEN. BY STUDENT INTEREST CURRENT REGIONAL AND STATEWIDE LABOR MARKET DATA INDUSTRY ADVOCACY AND INVOLVEMENT. AM I MET WITH PROGRAMS OFFERED AT THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS. K. TWELVE CITIES UNIQUE FROM C. T. PROGRAMS OFFERED IN COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN THAT THEY EMPHASIZE THE INTEGRATION OF GENERAL ACADEMICS. ANNA WITH CTP AND COURSES ARE BASED ON THE CT MODEL CURRICULUM STANDARDS. CORRECT TECHNICAL STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS INSTANT LEADERSHIP'S OURS THE LEADERSHIP ARE INTEGRAL TO CT COURSE OBJECTIVES AND STUDENTS ARE PROVIDED WITH THE CURRICULUM OF WORK BASED LEARNING EXPERIENCES. THROUGH OUT THER CT COURSE SEQUENCE. SO HERE'S A QUICK UPDATE ON EIGHT EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FISCAL YEAR SEE TAKE APPLICATION PROCESS -- THE APPLICATIONS OPEN TO THE ELLIE ETS ON DECEMBER NINETEENTH TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THEY WERE THEN DO BACK TO THE CD E. ON JANUARY TWENTY FIFTH. WE UNDERSTAND THAT WAS A TIGHT TIME LINE BUT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO TO GET THE ALLOCATIONS OUT TO SCHOOLS. PRIOR TO THE MARCH FIFTEENTH NOTICING -- OF TEACHERS. APPLICATIONS RECEIVED I WE HAD A TOTAL OF THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE APPLICATIONS RECEIVED -- OF OF THOSE APPLICATIONS THREE HUNDRED FORTY TWO OF THOSE APPLICATIONS WERE ACTUALLY READ AND SCORED -- THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN GRANTEES SERVING FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO ELEAZAR. OTHER PRELIMINARY ALLOCATION YES IS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND THE TOTAL ASK FROM THOSE THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE APPLICATIONS WAS. THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS -- GRANT AWARD NOTIFICATIONS WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF GETTING THOSE OUT TO THE FIELD -- AND WORKING THROUGH OUR PROCESSES AT THE DEPARTMENT TO DO THAT. SERVER FUNDING RESULTS AS I MENTIONED I AM A TOTAL OF THREE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN APPLICATIONS WILL BE FUNDED. SERVING A TOTAL OF FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY TWO LOCAL EDUCATION AND AGENCIES -- THIS LIST WAS PROVIDED AT THE MARCH BOARD MEETING STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION MEETING -- AGAIN 200-98 INDIVIDUALS A INDIVIDUAL LEDS. THIRTY AND THIRTY NINE CONSORTIUM MADE UP OF TWO OR MORE FOR THIS THIRTY NINE CONSORTIA ACTUALLY MAKE UP A TOTAL OF TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES. AND THEN FIFTY THREE OUT OF FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES ARE REPRESENTED AND LIKE YOU AS SENATOR ROUGH I DO LIKE PICTURES TOO SO THAT WOULD BE HE HE ADDS. I HAVE PROVIDED YOU WITH. THE MAP OF THE STATE AND WHAT THIS ACTUALLY SHOWS IS THE SPREAD OF FUNDING THROUGHOUT THE STATE THE BUBBLE WILL FOR EACH COUNTY THIS IS DONE BY COUNTY IT THE BUBBLE FOR EACH COUNTY. I TELLS YOU HOW MANY GRANTS WERE AWARDED IN THAT COUNTY AND REMEMBER THAT COULD BE AN INDIVIDUAL ELLIE A OR COULD BE CONSORTIA. AND THEN THE TOTAL DOLLARS AWARDED FOR THOSE COUNTIES. SAYS THE POSITIVE THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO AND FOR AT IMPLEMENTATION WITH THE TAG COMING UP BIRTH -- FIRST OF ALL AT THE SUPERINTENDENT OF ABC UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT -- WILL WRITE A LETTER FOR EACH OF THE STUDENT THAT COMPLETES THEIR CAREER PATHWAY EDUCATION PROGRAM GUARANTEEING THEM AN INTERVIEW FOR A TEACHING POSITION ONCE THEY FINISH THEIR POST SECONDARY EDUCATION -- ANOTHER -- POINT IS THAT RED BLUFF HIGH SCHOOL IN THE NORTH OFFERS SIXTY NINE SECTIONS OF CTE COURSES. SERVING FIFTH ELEVEN OF OUR FIFTEEN SECTORS AND THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES ACTUALLY VOTED TO EXPAND THEIR SCHOOL PERIOD FROM SIXTY PERIOD TO A SEVEN DAY PERIOD -- AND ALL STUDENTS AT ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE A TWO YEAR SEQUENCE OF COURSES IN A C. T. E. PATHWAY AS A GRADUATION REQUIREMENT. AND THIS YEAR FOR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE CLASS OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WILL BE THE FIRST CLASS TO HAVE ALL GRADUATES. AND COMPLETING A SEQUENCE OF COURSES IN CT. A COUNTRY COSTA COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION REPORTED NEARLY 86% OTHER TEACHERS REPORT THAT THEIR STUDENTS PARTICIPATE IN WORK BASED LEARNING EXPERIENCES -- WILL CAN THEY'LL CONTINUE TO BE ACTIVE PARTNERS AND THEY EARN AND LEARN EAST BAY INITIATIVE WITH THEGOAL OF EXPANDING. THEIR INDUSTRY PARTNERSHIPS AND WORK BASED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEIR STUDENTS. AND THEN IN SAN BERNADINO COUNTY CONSORTIUM MEMBERS WILL ASSESS THEIR PRACTICES FOR COLLECTING DATA PERTAINING TO WORK BASED LEARNING. AND LOOK AT HOW BEST TO CAPTURE THIS DATA ELEMENT FOR C. T. E.. PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR PEAS COMMUNITY CLASSROOM METHODOLOGY -- COMMUNITY CLASSROOM IS -- AN UNPAID -- UNPAID. FIVE INTERNSHIP AND THEY WILL BE-OFFERING THAT TO COMMUNE CONSORTIUM MEMBERS AND THE CONSORTIUM WILL ALSO LEVERAGE THE WORK OF THE INLAND DESERT. REGIONAL STRONG WORK FORCE CONSORTIUM TO LEARN ABOUT THE LAUNCH APPRENTICESHIP NETWORK PROJECT WHICH HAS A YOUTH APPRENTICESHIP COMPONENT. IS PART OF FOCUSING ON THE EXPANDING ROLE OF RECOGNIZED APPRENTICESHIPS -- AND WITH THAT -- WE ALSO AS OUR FUNDING FOR SEVEN TECHNICAL REGIONAL CENTER SEVEN REGIONAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS -- COMES TO AN END OF THIS JUNE AT TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PUBLICLY THANK THEM FOR THEIR SERVICE IN THE HARD WORK THAT THEY'VE PROVIDED. AND DURING THE PAST THREE YEARS OF SERVING OUR AND LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES WITH THE SEA TO GRANT NO MAYBE MIKE I'M NOT SURE MY QUESTION REALLY MAKES SENSE OR EVEN AS RELEVANT BUT SO IF I'M LOOKING AT A K. THROUGH TWELVE DISTRICT IN THERE A HUNDRED GRADUATES OF YOU KNOW AT THE END OF THE THE THE TERM. I AM ABLE TO TELL THAT SIXTY OF THE HUNDRED ONE TWO OF TWO OR FOUR YEAR. COLLEGE. OF THE TWENTY OF THEM. AS A RESULT OF K. TO TWELVE C. T. PROGRAMS WENT INTO OTHER MANUFACTURING JOBS OR MANUFACTURING APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM THE TEN WENT. TO BECAUSE OF A ICE CAGE YOU -- TWELVE CT PROGRAM WENT INTO AN EITHER IN AEROSPACE. F. MAINTENANCE POSITION OR AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE -- TRAINING OR APPRENTICESHIP JOB AND AT THE LAST TEN WENT TO AG BECAUSE OF WAS A CASE OF TWELVE DISTRICT THAT HAD AN AG SEAT YOU PROGRAM. YES SO THAT'S PART OF THE FOLLOW UP DATA FOLLOWUP STAYS AT WE DO WE'VE TYPICALLY DONE ON THIS FOLLOW UP STUDIES WITH OUR PERKINS FUNDS FROM THE FEDERAL AND THAT WE RECEIVE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- AND WE HAVE STARTED DOING FOLLOW UP STUDIES WITH OUR SEE TEAGUE GRANT -- AND SAID THAT THE OTHER CHART THAT I PROVIDED WITH YOU FOLKS -- AND SO THEN THAT IS IN FOLLOW UP AND THAT WAS PART OF THE LEGISLATION IS TO FIND OUT HOW MANY OF THOSE STUDENTS ACTUALLY CONTINUED ON EITHER WENT TO THE MILITARY AND SO FORTH OR WENT ON TO EMPLOYMENT OR EDUCATION IN THE SAME. IN THE AME PATTERN MAYBE THIS IS GONNA BE PART OF THIS LONGITUDINAL. LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM THE BEST THAT THE GOVERNOR AND THE FIRST FOR TALKING ABOUT. IN A CRADLE TO CAREER -- BUT I WAS GONNA ASK IT AND MAYBE I SHOULD LET EVERYBODY ELSE FINISH BUT AS PART OF THE STRONG WORK FOCE AND THE C. T. INCENTIVE GRANT AND WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A FEW YEARS. WHAT SORT OF DATA DEFICIENCIES? HAVE YOU IDENTIFIED. IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THE DATA SYSTEM OUGHT TO BE STATEWIDE AND YOU KNOW LOCAL OPTION RIGHT. WHAT SORT OF DATA DEFICIENCIES HAVE YOU IDENTIFIED AND AND WHAT ACTION ARE WE TAKING TO REMEDY THE DEFICIENCIES IN ORDER TO GIVE A? GIVE US A ROBUST -- BODY OF DATA FROM WHICH TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS IN THE FUTURE THE FIRST QUESTION I THINK THAT'S A FAIR QUESTION. AND SO AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS IS THAT -- WHEN SEATED FIRST ROLLED OUT A THINK THERE WAS AN EXPECTATION THAT OUR CALL PADS ARE CALIFORNIA LONGITUDINAL PEOPLE DATA SYSTEM? WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO COLLECT A LOT OF THE DATA AND THERE'S BEEN -- A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT AS PRESSURE ON CAL PADS ITSELF TO COLLECT. NOT JUST OUR C. T. E. DATA BUT DATA FOR ALL OF THE STUDENTS RIGHT ACROSS THE STATE -- AND SO. AND SOME THINGS THAT I HELP HAS. CANDY CURRENTLY IS IT CAN COLLECT THE NUMBER C. T. E. STUDENTS THEY CAN COLLECT PATHWAY INFORMATION. BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY AT THIS POINT T. DISAGGREGATED DATA BY FUNDING SOURCE IF YOU'RE ASKING SPECIFICALLY. HOW DO WE KNOW WHICH STUDENTS BENEFITED FROM SEATED WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO TELL YOU THAT EXCEPT WE DID WE JUST STARTED TO IMPLEMENT A SURVEY SYSTEM -- WITH OUR WITH OUR GRANTEES AND THAT'S WHERE THIS DATA CAME FROM -- WE DID A FOR FIRST WE DID A ADAM. A SURVEY TO DO ENROLLMENT DATA TO SEE WHAT TYPES OF OUTCOMES THAT WE DID GET WHAT WE COULD GET -- AND SO THIS IS JUST THE ENROLLMENT DATA AND THEN WE'LL BE ROLLING OUT ANOTHER SURVEY TO OUR FOLKS SPECIFICALLY WITH THE TAG -- TO GET TO GET THAT DATA AS WELL WE ALMOST NEED A SYSTEM THAT WORKS WITHOUT THE NEED FOR SURVEYS RIGHT EXACTLY SO I MEAN THE THE EXISTING SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE DOES IT IT. IT CAN TELL YOU HOW MANY STUDENTS ARE ENROLLED K. THROUGH TWELVE I GUESS HER AND ROLLED IN C. T.. CAN IT TELL YOU HOW MANY OF THOSE STUDENTS SECURE JOBS IN THE FIELD IN THE C. T. THAT DOES NOT IT DOES NOT GIVE US THE FOLLOW UP. ON THE WEATHER OF SOMEBODY WHO'S IN A MANUFACTURING RELATED C. T. PROGRAM WINDS UP AS A PRIEST AT STARBUCKS OR WHETHER THEY'RE ACTUALLY INTO. WE DO FIRMS ARE PERFECT FOR PERKINS WE DO -- BECAUSE THAT'S TRADITIONAL DATA WE'VE ALWAYS COLLECTED FOR PERKINS -- BUT NOT FOR STATEWIDE CT. YES SIR I DID ME I MEAN TO CUT YOU WANNA THAT'S THAT'S PERFECTLY FINE NO -- IT'S I THINK I THINK THE THE TWO LEGISLATIVE PIECES THAT ARE HERE THAT WERE REPORTING ON A REALLY DESIGNED TO SORT OF HELP US TO BEGIN TO CREATE THAT THAT. DISCUSSION ABOUT WHERE DO WE CONNECT THE SYSTEMS IN TERMS OF THE DATA POINTS IN OTHER WORDS WHAT ARE THE RELEVANT PIECES. BY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE COLLEGE AND CAREER INDICATORS THAT ARE COMING OUT OF THE CAGE WILL SYSTEM. AND THEN HOW TO THOSE SORT OF RELATE BECAUSE WE KNOW FULL WELL THAT PART OF THE COLLEGE -- INDICATOR IS -- LIKE DUAL ENROLLMENT -- WHICH IS. A GOOD WAY TO SORT OF MEASURE WHETHER STUDENTS ARE MAKING PROGRESS IN COLLEGE ATTAINMENT SO. WHAT WE'VE DONE NOW THAT'S THE GOAL YEAH IF THAT'S THE GOAL SO I MEAN THE SORT OF METRICS THAT WE HAVE IN STRONG WORK FOR US WE'RE TRYING TO INSURE THAT THEY'RE CONNECTING? AND PART OF THAT WORK IS IT'S THE LONGITUDINAL THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. IT'S INSURING THAT THE DATA MO USER IN PLACE TO TO TO SAY THAT CAL PADS CAN TALK TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN MY S. SYSTEM. SO THAT WE CAN CREATE SORT OF A OF A PIPELINE BECAUSE THIS IS A PIPELINE CREATION RIGHT IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT THESE TWO PIECES OF LEGISLATION ARE DESIGNED TO DO. IS TRY TO CONNECT THE SYSTEMS WHEN WE GO TO OTHER STATES AND PRESENT ON THIS. IS NOT A LOT OF OTHER STATES THAT ARE CONNECTING THAT THE SECONDARY TO POST SECONDARY SYSTEM RIGHT SO WE ALSO NEED THE END RIGHT AND WE NEED TO HAVE THE DATA. THE OUTCOME DATA IN ORDER TO DEVELOP TO EVALUATE THE EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE FINDING AND BE AGILE ENOUGH. TWO SHIFTS TO PIVOT FROM PROGRAM BETA PROGRAM BE IF A IS NOT WORKING. OR WERE PRODUCING PEOPLE WERE TURNING OUT A PRODUCT THAT THAT INDUSTRY DOESN'T NEED RIGHT. YEAH THERE'S CERTAIN PROGRAMS THAT A K. THROUGH TWELVE SYSTEM WILL BE ABLE TO OFFER BETTER THAN A COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN AND VICE VERSA SO. WHERE IS THE DEVELOPMENTAL NEED OF THE STUDENT IN TERMS OF THEIR TRAJECTORY AND I THINK THAT'S THE QUESTION TO GET OUT THERE AND IF I CAN JUST JUMP IN HERE TO REMEMBER ALEXANDER WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- TO PROVIDE TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE CREATION OF THIS. AT CRADLE TO CAREER -- MINOR TIDAL DATA SYSTEM AND HOPEFULLY THAT WILL ACCOMPLISH MANY OF THE GOALS THAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING -- TO GET THAT NO FOR THIS YEAR THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING DISCUSSIONS ON YOU KNOW FOR THE PAST YEAH I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY YEARS -- BUT JUST REALLY BEING ABLE TO TRACK -- AS STUDENTS PROGRESS AS THEY GO FROM K. TWELVE TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE INTO THE WORK FORCE AND REALLY FINDING OUT YOU KNOW WHERE THEY END UP ALONG THAT EDUCATIONAL PATHWAY -- WITH REGARDS TO THESE TWO PROGRAMS SPECIFICALLY -- IN RESPONSE TO SOME OF THE DATA DEFICIENCIES THAT THAT HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED IN PREVIOUS YEARS THERE WERE SOME IMPORTANT CHANGES THAT WERE MADE LAST YEAR -- IT FOR BOTH PROGRAMS AND ONE OF THE KEY CHANGES WAS REALLY THE INCORPORATION OF THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE AND JOINT ADVISORY COMMITTEE. AND FOR BOTH OF THESE PROGRAMS THAT COMMITTEE IS ASKED TO GO IN AND REVIEW THE DATA METRICS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE REPORTED ON BY A GRANT APPLICANTS. AND TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO IF THEY'RE THE MOST APPROPRIATE METRICS ENSURING THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY COLLECTIBLE. AND THEN ALSO LOOKING AT WHETHER NEW METRICS NEEDED TO BE ADDED AND SO AS OUR DATA SYSTEMS CONTINUE TO DEVELOP. THE HOPE IS THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO INCORPORATE MORE CAREER MEASURES INTO -- INDICATORS LIKE THE COLLEGE AND CAREER AND REALLY HAVE THAT DATA THAT WE NEED TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISIONS AT THE STATE LEVEL. IT'S REALLY A CONNECTIVITY ISSUE ISN'T IT BECAUSE WE HAVE THESE. THESE ENTITIES THESE ORGANIZATIONS THESE SYSTEMS WORKING IN THE SAME. YOU KNOW ENVIRONMENT BUT YOU'RE WORKING AND SO THE QUESTION IS HOW YOU CONNECT. AND OPERATE IN THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO INSURE THAT YOUR SERVICING YOUR CUSTOMER CLIENT WHICH IN YOUR CASE IS. OF THE STUDENTS SERVICE AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU DELIVER TO THEM THE PRODUCT THAT THEY THINK THEY'RE GONNA GET WHICH IS AN EDUCATION THAT GETS THEM. A GOOD PAYING JOB IN A FIELD THEY WANT TO WORK IN. WHETHER THEY'RE A HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE OR A COMMUNITY COLLEGE GRADUATE OR SOMETHING BEYOND OR SOMETHING IN BETWEEN. AND THAT'S REALLY THE ISSUE IT REQUIRES DAY THAT REQUIRES EVERYBODY TO TALK TOGETHER IN THE DATA. TO BE ACCESSIBLE BY EVERYONE AND THEN. SOME OF I WEIGH TION OF PROGRAMS AND THE MONEY THAT WE SPEND AND THE RE DIRECTION OF THAT MONEY IF THEY'RE BETTER WAYS. TO USE THAT MONEY BUT ANYWAY GREAT JOB I DID I DO YOU. ANYBODY HAVE ANYTHING ELSE. GREAT PRESENTATION LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU THANK YOU. ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT IS ADULT EDUCATION. OUR FINAL ISSUE FOR THE DAY WELL GOOD AFTERNOON HOAX SO WE HAVE NEW FACES HERE LET'S START TO MY LEFT HER FEW DATA FOR YOURSELF FOR THE RECORD. PASTI NELSON WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN SIR. KEITH IS ON DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. CAROLINE SACRI DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. OF YOUR AMERILA CALIFORNICUM ECOLOGIST CHAPTERS OFFICE OKAY. WHAT'S THE STORY -- GO AHEAD AND START AGAIN HE'S THE KING THAT LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WE FINANCE TO PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAM AND SO THE SECOND SET OF DISTRIBUTED ONE MORE HAND OUT FROM OUR OFFICE FOR TODAY. IF YOU TURN TO THE FIRST PAGE OF THIS HANDOUT WE'LL SEE THAT LITTLE EDUCATION AS MULTIPLE PURPOSES BUT IS PRIMARILY INTENDED TO PROVIDE PRECLUDED KNOWLEDGE SKILLS AND ABILITIES. KIDADA AND ADULT EDUCATION PROVIDERS OFFER COURSEWORK IN BASIC ENGLISH NOT SOMETIMES CULMINATING IN HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA. ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE AND ALSO IN SHORT TERM CT. IN CALIFORNIA THE MAIN PROVIDERS OF ADULT EDUCATION OUR ADULT SCHOOLS FROM WITHIN THAT KIT ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS AS WELL AS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES SYSTEM. HISTORICALLY THESE TWO SYSTEMS IT'LL SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT RULES AND POLICIES AND SO IN TWENTY THIRTEEN FOURTEEN THE STATE. ATTEMPTED TO ADDRESS THAT DIFFERENCE BY RESTRUCTURING ADULT EDUCATION INTO A SYSTEM OF REGIONAL CONSORTIA THAT BRING TOGETHER ADULT SCHOOLS INCLUDING COLLEGES. CURRENTLY THERE ARE SEVENTY ONE OF THESE REGIONAL CONSORTIA ACROSS THE STATE SUED THESE ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE STRONG WORK FORCE CONSORTIA THAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING IN THE EARLIER PANEL. THE STATE DID ALSO BEGAN IN TWENTY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN TO PROVIDE. ONGOING FUNDING FOR ADULT EDUCATION THROUGH WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY CALLED THE ADULT EDUCATION BLOCK GRANT. AND WAS RECENTLY RENAMED THE ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAM THE ORIGINAL AMOUNT THERE WAS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION ON GOING. IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT ADULT EDUCATION PROVIDER SOMETIMES RECEIVE FUNDING FROM OTHER SOURCES. FOR EXAMPLE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES DO RECEIVE APPORTIONMENT FOR THE NON CREDIT ADULT EDUCATION COURSES. AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND ADULT SCHOOLS MAY RECEIVE FEDERAL. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE STATE DID PROVIDE AN AUGMENTATION FOR THE ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAM THE BOOK OF THIS AUTHENTICATION TWENTY TWO MILLION WAS. FOR COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE PROGRAM WAS CREATED. THERE IS ALSO A FIVE MILLION DOLLAR AUGMENTATION ON GOING FOR IT DID IMPROVEMENTS PRIMARILY RELATED TO IMPROVING OUR ABILITY TO TRACK STUDENT OUTCOMES AS THEY MOVE ACROSS PROVIDERS AND EVENTUALLY INTO THE WORK FORCE. YOU'LL HEAR SHORTLY FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT THE GOVERNOR DOES ALSO PROPOSING ADDITIONAL COST OF AN ADJUSTMENT FOR THIS YEAR WHICH WOULD BRING TOTAL FUNDING FOR THE ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAM TO FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE MILLION ON GOING. THE COMPUTER OVERVIEW WE JUST WANTED TO BRIEFLY NOTE SOME ONGOING CONVERSATIONS REGARDING ALIGNMENT IN THE STATE THAT'LL EDUCATION SYSTEM. AS I NOTED THE ADULT EDUCATION SYSTEM AS IT'S DESIGNED AS BRING TOGETHER TO PREVIOUSLY DESPERATE SYSTEMS. AND WHAT THE STATE HAS MADE MANY EFFORTS TO INCREASE ALIGNMENT BETWEEN MIDDLE SCHOOLS IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THERE ARE SOME ISSUES THAT REMAIN UNRESOLVED. ONE OF THOSE ISSUES HAS TO DO WITH HOW THE STATE FUNDS ADULT EDUCATION. BECAUSE THERE IS A SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT APPROACH TO THE ADULT SCHOOLS VERSUS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. PER STUDENT FUNDING LEVELS LIKELY VERY QUITE A BIT ACROSS PROVIDERS WHICH COULD RESULT IN DIFFERENCES IN ACCESSING QUALITY FOR STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE. THERE ARE ALSO A NUMBER OF POLICIES THAT CONTINUE TO DIFFER AT THE ADULT SCHOOLS. COMPARED TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES INCLUDING POLICIES RELATED COURSE FEES AND MINIMUM INSTRUCTOR QUALIFICATIONS. AND FINALLY THERE'S AN ONGOING CONVERSATION AROUND DATA IMPROVEMENTS AS REFERENCED IN THAT BUDGET PROPOSALS FROM LAST YEAR. ON TO DEFEAT THE STATE DOES NOT HAVE COMPLAINTS ABOUT CONSIDER FOR ADULT STUDENTS THOUGH THAT ARMS OF INDICATED THAT IMPROVEMENTS ARE UNDERWAY AND HE'LL LIKELY HERE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT LATER ON THE PANEL. THANK YOU THANK YOU MA'AM THAT. SO KEEP HIS -- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. ON THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES OVER SIX HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL FUNDING FOR THREE PRIMARY ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAMS -- LARGEST OF WHICH IS THE MAIN ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAM THE WHICH HAS FIVE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR POINT SIX MILLION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND -- ALLOCATED TO IT WHICH IS A JOINT ADMINISTERED BY THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCES OFFICE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION -- THERE'S ALSO FIFTEEN POINT SEVEN MILLION PROPOSITION NINETY GENERAL FUND FOR THE DALTON CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES PROGRAM WHICH IS RUN BY THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION -- AND LASTLY THERE'S OVER A HUNDRED FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDS -- FOR THE TITLE TO WORK FORCE INNOVATION OPPORTUNITIES ACT AND CAL WORKS PROGRAMS THAT SERVE ADULT EDUCATION -- PROVIDE ADULT EDUCATION SERVICES -- ADDITIONALLY -- THERE'S ALSO SOME SOME PORTION OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES APPORTIONMENT AND THE K. TWELVE ABORTIONS -- ARE USED TO PROVIDES SERVICES TO THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF STUDENTS THAT -- AND THE TYPE OF PROGRAMS AT THE MAIN ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAM -- PROVIDES -- AS MENTIONED THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES A COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT FOR THE MAIN ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAM OF EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS AND FOR UNDER FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO THE DALTON CORRECTION FACILITIES. PROGRAM [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] YES MA'AM. GOOD AFTERNOON -- AS I SAID I'M CAROLINE'S ACREE AND I AM SPEAKING HERE ON BEHALF OF SUPERINTENDENT TONY THURMAN. THIS WEEK I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IS ADULT EDUCATION WEEK IN SERVICES NOW OPPORTUNE TIME TO TALK ABOUT THIS TOPIC. FROM THE ADULT EDUCATION OFFICE AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DELIVERS ASSISTANCE AND GUIDANCE. TO PROVIDERS IN THE FIELD ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ADULT SERVICES ADULT EDUCATION SERVICES. IN CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA IS THE LARGEST PROVIDER OF ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAMS IN THE COUNTRY. WITH FULL FUNDING FROM AS KEITH SAID WE OWE A TITLE TO ADULT EDUCATION FAMILY LITERACY ACT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. AND THEN IT IN -- JOINT JOINTLY WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE THE CALIFORNIA DELTA G. CATION PROGRAM. RECENTLY WE SENT OVER A DRAFT OF OUR REPORT FOR YOU TO REVIEW THAT ADDRESSES THE KEY -- PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING STATE LEVEL DATA ON STUDENT ENROLLMENT OUTCOMES SKILL GAINS STUDENT DEMOGRAPHICS AND OTHER DATA. I'M USING THE NEW ADULT EDUCATION DATA AND ACCOUNTABILITY METRICS AS WELL AS OUR RECOMMENDATIONS AND I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. I WOULD LIKE TO ADD -- HI YOUR MAIL FROM THE CALIFORNIA COMING UP CALLED DISCOUNTERS OFFICE. ON THE PARTNERSHIP WITH WITH DEPARTMENT EDUCATION WE'VE BEEN FOCUSED ON THE LAST TWO THREE YEARS HAVE BEEN THE STRUCTURAL ISSUES DESCRIBE THAT MEANS WE ADULT EDUCATION WAS RE IMAGINE AND REGIONAL COMES. AS RITA CONSORTIA AND WAS TO BE BASED ON METRICS SO WE VIEW THOSE AS STRUCTURAL ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. SO WE'VE INVESTED AND CAPACITY BUILDING WITHIN OUR REGIONAL CONSORTIA SO THEY COULD DO THE KIND OF PLANNING. WITH THEIR STAKEHOLDERS MONKS THE PROVIDERS THOSE ARE SEVEN ONE CONSORTIUMS OVERSEE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY PROVIDERS -- BEEN ALSO A BIG KEY TO THIS ACTUALLY BECOMING UP A SYSTEM OF A PROGRAM MADE UP OF TWO SYSTEMS. ARE THE METRICS AND THE DATA THAT WE WE ACTUALLY REQUIRE OUR PROVIDERS TO REPORT. AND GLAD TO SAY THAT BUT DURING THE LAST THREE YEARS WE'VE CREATED A UNIFORM DATA COLLECTION SYSTEM. WHICH WAS A PROVIDER FOR THAT WE TITLE TO THAT SEE THE LOCAL CITY FOR MANY YEARS. SO THEY ACTUALLY BECAME A UNIFORM DATA COLLECTION PROVIDER FOR THE KP TWELVE FOR THE STATE PROGRAM AS WELL -- LAST YEAR -- WE ACTUALLY REQUIRED OUR COLLEGES TO PARTICIPATE WITH THE ACTUALLY YOUR PRIOR THE LAST YEAR WE HAVE. ACTUALLY JUST RELY ON THERE ARE EXISTING REPORTING SYSTEM TO MEET OUR REPORTING NEEDS FOR ADULT EDUCATION SO ARE WE NOW HAVE OUR M. I. S.. R. OUR OUR WEEK OUR PROVIDER CROSSES AND ALL THAT DATA -- GETS REPORTED UP TO TO A FILE ON THAT'S PRESENTED UTILIZING A PLATFORM THAT WE REFER TO IN A LARGE BOARD AS ADULT EDUCATION PIPELINE. AND THAT DATA IS UTILIZES. ALARM ARCADY TRIAL DATA AT THE VALIDATE SARAH TRANSITION DATA WHAT AM I A SYSTEM -- AND THEN ACTUALLY -- VALIDATES WITH EDT TAXING NOW THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY PORT WAGE GAINS -- IT AND PUT THAT THERE WERE ACTUALLY WORKING THAT OUT TWO QUARTERS AFTER EXIT. THINGS THAT WE CANNOT TELL YOU IN THE PAST REGARDING ADULT EDUCATION -- SO AND THAT THE PLATFORM IS WHAT WE UTILIZE TO NOW MOVING FORWARD TO REPORT Q.. ON THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR -- BUT ALSO IT PROVIDES A PLATFORM THAT'S USABLE FOR CONSORTIUMS OUR PROVIDERS. SO THEY ACTUALLY HAVE ACTIONABLE DATA IN WHICH THEY COULD UTILIZE FOR THEIR THREE YEAR PLANNING WHICH THEY HAVE UNDER WAY IN WHICH THAT'S PART OF OUR STRUCTURAL WORK THAT WE DID IS THAT WE ACTUALLY CREATED BY THREE YEAR PLANNING PROCESS. THAT HAS FOUR COMPONENTS TO IT ONE IS THEY ACTUALLY -- DO AN ASSESSMENT OF THE RESOURCES REGIONALLY AMONGST THEIR PROVIDERS AMONGST APPROACH THEIR THEIR PARTNERS SUCH AS THE THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD SYSTEMS. AND THEN ALSO THEN THEY ACTUALLY CAN DO CONCERTS LOOK AT THE NEEDS OF THEIR COMMUNITY ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE REGION. THE LABOR MARKET INFORMATION WE'VE MADE A LOT OF VESTMENTS AND MADE A LOT OF DATA AVAILABLE WE ARE ON LABOR MARKET INFORMATION JUST TO GET THE CONVERSATION GOING. WE WANT THEM TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM. THEN AFTER THAT ACTUALLY COME UP WITH SOME STRATEGIES. AND THEN AFTER THAT PILOT SOME NEW IDEAS -- SO THAT'S KIND OF THE STRUCTURAL THINGS WE'VE DONE TO ACTUALLY MOVE -- ACHIEVE I THINK SOME ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS A ON WE EXPECT THAT TO CONTINUE. LET. ME JUST ASK THIS QUESTION I MEAN BEYOND DATA COLLECTION COMPILATION THINGS LIKE THAT -- V. L. A. -- MENTION SOME. EXISTING ISSUES -- IN TERMS OF MAKING THE TWO IN ESSENCE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM IN CASE OF TWELVE WORK SMOOTHLY TOWARD ACCOMPLISHING A COMMON GOAL HERE IN ADULT EDUCATION ONE WAS. EARLY A FUNDING ISSUE THE OTHER IS THERE. MUST BE A CREDENTIALING QUALIFICATION ISSUE -- ALLOWING INSTRUCTORS TO SERVE CROSS TEACH SO TO SPEAK IN DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS. MAYBE YOU COULD DISCUSS SOME OF THE IMPEDIMENTS THAT THAT IF IF THAT'S THE RIGHT WORD -- THEY WE HAVE STRUCTURALLY HERE IN THE STATE. THAT CREATES SOME ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO HAVING -- SMOOTHLY RUNNING ADULT EDUCATION. SYSTEM INVOLVING PARTICIPANTS FROM DIFFERENT COMING FROM TO THE PROCESS FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS THE FIST QUESTION -- CERTAINLY AND I'D LIKE TO CALL IT A CHALLENGE. VERSES AN IMPEDIMENT BECAUSE IT IT IS A CHALLENGE AND I'D LIKE TO TALK OF IT -- CREDENTIALING THE TEACHER QUALIFICATION PIECE FIRST. CURRENTLY -- INDIVIDUALS THAT TEACH IN A K. ADULT. SYSTEM ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE A CURRENT CREDENTIAL ISSUED BY CTC. IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM THEY HAVE TO MEET MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS. ONE OF THOSE MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS CAN BE THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE A TEACHING CREDENTIAL. IF THEY ARE -- AND IT'S UP TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHOOSE WHICH QUALIFICATION THEY'RE GOING. TO TO RECEDE THE OTHER CHALLENGE IS THERE'S A PAY DIFFERENTIAL. THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES RE ABLE TO PAY THOSE TEACHERS AT A HIGHER RATE. THAN MANY OF OUR KD ADULT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE ABLE TO PAY THEIR TEACHERS. AND THAT HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE FOR THAT PAID PIECE AND THEN TO BRING INSTRUCTORS FROM THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE INTO OUR K. TWELVE CABLE SYSTEM. THEY HAVE TO THEN GO AND GET A CREDENTIAL BECAUSE IN ORDER TO TEACH AND BE ON THE PAYROLL THEY HAVE TO HAVE THAT CREDENTIAL AND WE ARE LOOKING AT SOME WAYS THROUGH OUR ADULT EDUCATION ASSOCIATIONS TO COME UP. WITH WAYS TO EASE THAT BURDEN BECAUSE THERE IS A COST TO TO GO AND GET YOUR CREDENTIAL. UP. TO THREE FOUR FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. TO GET THAT CREDENTIAL AND SO IT IS A COST TO THOSE TEACHERS WHO ARE THEN GOING TO BE MAKING. NOT A NOT A LOT OF MONEY TO RECOUP THAT IN THE FUTURE SO WE'RE LOOKING AT WAYS TO STREAMLINE THAT. I REALIZE THE SENSITIVITY OF THIS QUESTION OF BUT IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT MAYBE THIS IS A CONVERSATION THAT WE NEED TO HAVE AT LEAST IN TERMS OF I MEAN I GUESS IT DEPENDS ON WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO TEACH AND WHO WERE TRYING TO TEACH. AND IS IT US THIS IS A SPECIALIZED. AREA OR TO OUR SUBJECT AREA WHERE. IT WOULD IT WOULD. BE VERY DIFFICULT TO NECESSARILY HAVE SOMEBODY CREDENTIALED IN THE CONTEXT OF K. THROUGH TWELVE AT A PARTICULAR DISTRICT BECAUSE MAYBE DON'T TEACH THAT OFTEN. MAYBE THERE THAT THAT MANY STUDENTS INTO TEACHING IT AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE MIGHT HAVE SOMEONE AVAILABLE IN A SPECIALIZED AREA TO TEACH A PARTICULAR COURSE. AND IT WOULD SEEM SORT OF AND DIFFICULT TO REQUIRE. EIGHT TO TWELVE TEACHING CREDENTIAL UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU'RE TEACHING ENGLISH -- IN YOUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE INSTRUCTOR AND THEY WANT TO PUT YOU OUT OF SIGHT SHE WON A CASE OF TWELVE CAMPUS TO KEEP TEACH ENGLISH WELL THAT'S SOMETHING THAT. EIGHT TO TWELVE RB TEACHING. THEN I WOULD THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE A DIFFERENT SCENARIO OR MY COMMENTS MAKING SENSE SUIT SO THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TEACHING SO THEY ARE -- IN THE CREDENTIALING SYSTEM A TEACHER TEACHING INDICATED OLD SCHOOL CAN HAVE. HE A MULTIPLE SUBJECT OR A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHING CREDENTIAL AND THAT ALLOWS THEM TO TEACH ADULTS AND IT'S VERY SPECIFIC ON THEIR CREDENTIAL. THEN THERE IS WHAT'S CALLED A DESIGNATED SUBJECTS CREDENTIAL IN THE THAT IS FOR SOMEONE WHO. HAS A BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN WISHES TO PERHAPS WORK WITH ADULTS WHO ARE LEARNING ENGLISH AND THEY WANT TO COME BACK AND TEACH. WRAPS THE RETIRED NOW AND AND THEY WANT TO DO SOMETHING ELSE. DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND SO THEN THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH COURSE WORK TO EARN THAT DESIGNATED SUBJECTS CREDENTIAL. THE COURSE WORK REALLY FOCUSES ON AND GO G. IN THE TEACHING O ADULTS. AND ADULT LEARNERS VERSUS TEACHING CHILDREN WELL MAYBE MAYBE I NEED TO ASK A DIFFERENT QUESTION. WHAT IS IT EXACTLY WERE TEACHING IN THESE ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAMS? ARE WE TEACHING BUT WE USED TO CALL THE G. E. D.. PROGRAM ARE WE TEACHING -- CAREER TECH EDUCATION TYPE COURSES WERE ACTUALLY TEACHING BOTH OF THOSE OKAY AND ALL OF THOSE FOR TEACHING ADULT BASIC EDUCATION. WHICH IS FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE LOW LEVEL LOW LEVELS OF LITERACY. FOR TEACHING ADULTS SECONDARY EDUCATION SO INDIVIDUALS THAT WANT TO RECEIVE THEIR HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA IS THAT FOR SOME REASON WERE DERAILED. DURING THEIR NORMAL HIGH SCHOOL CAREER OR HIGH SCHOOL EQUIVALENCY SUCH AS THE GED HIGH SET OR TASK THOSE OF THE THREE THAT WE ACCEPTED. ME DOING CALIFORNIA. ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE -- ILL CIVICS FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE MOVING INTO CITIZENSHIP AND WANTING TO ASSIST THEIR FAMILIES LEARNING HOW TO ASSIMILATE INTO GRANT -- IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION INTO OUR COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS SHORT TERM C. T. PROGRAMS. THEY ALSO HAVE PROGRAMS FOR WORK FORCE RE ENTRY. INTO THE RESERVE A HOUR THE WORK FOR SOMEONE TO COME BACK INTO THE WORK FORCE. AND PARENTS HELPING THEIR CHILDREN IN -- IN SCHOOL AND ADULTS WITH DISABILITIES SO -- OUR STATE FUNDING COVERS ALL OF THOSE. AREAS SO PERHAPS IN THE C. T. AREAS SO SPECIAL ICT COURSES CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME EXAMPLES. I MEAN THE ONE LEGACY IN A LIKE A CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANT OKAY WOULD BE A GOOD EXAMPLE OF A SHORT TERM THEY HAVE TO BE LESS THAN A YEAR PROGRAM. AND THAT WOULD REQUIRE SOMEONE THAT HAS AT EITHER INSTITUTION THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO HAVE A STATE LICENSE JR TO BE ABLE TO TEACH -- JORDAN FOR CNA SO WOULD YOU NEED TO HAVE A CASE YOU TWELVE TEACHING CREDENTIALED TEACHERS SEE IN A COURSE ON A CASE TO TWELVE CAMPUS YOU NEED TO HAVE A C. D. E. CREDENTIAL. THERE IS A CITY IN CREDENTIALS FOR THAT FOR THAT. REALLY. IN HEALTH. IN THAT AREA IN THAT AREA YES. IF I MAY ACTUALLY. SO. THAT I CUT YOU OUT NO FOR JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY SOMETHING SO. FOR ADULT SCHOOLS RUN IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. GENERALLY SPEAKING. THE INSTRUCTORS NEED TO HAVE A TEACHING CREDENTIAL ISSUED BY THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING IN ORDER TO INSTRUCT. STUDENTS IN ADULT EDUCATION THERE IS ONE EXCEPTION THE LEGISLATURE MADE TO THAT AND THAT JUST HAPPENED ACTUALLY. RECENTLY AND THAT'S FOR CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANTS THERE'S BEEN A A CHANGE IN. REQUIREMENTS OF RATIOS IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND SO YOU HAVE A LOT OF SKILLED NURSING FACILITY SAYING THEY NEED. A WORKFORCE TO MEET THAT. THAT HIGHER RATIO THAT THAT NEW RATIO AS A RESULT THE LEGISLATURE MADE AN EXCEPTION AND SAID FOR CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANTS STRUCTURES. INSTRUCTOR DOES NOT NEED TO HAVE. A TEACHING CREDENTIAL IN ORDER TO TEACH BUT FOR EVERYTHING ELSE PHARMACY TECHNICIAN. AUTOMOTIVE FOR SOME SORT OF INTRODUCTORY AUTOMOTIVE TECH WHATEVER THE PROGRAM IS A ENGLISH SECOND LANGUAGE. THE INSTRUCTOR IN AN ADULT SCHOOL NEEDS TO HAVE A TEACHING CREDENTIAL NOT SO WITH THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNICABLE JUST CALIFORNIA COMMUNICATE WHICH IS GENERALLY SPEAKING NEED TO HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE. ONLY TO MEET MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS TO TEACH AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. OUR ADULT EDUCATION COURSE WHICH IS DIFFICULT IT'S DIFFICULT FOR ADULTS SCHOOLS TO HIRE IF THEY SEE AN INSTRUCTOR FROM COMMITTEE BECAUSE THEY WANT TO HIRE. THAT THAT MAKES THINGS DIFFICULT. IT'S ALSO RAISES AN ISSUE ABOUT IS THE TEACHER CREDENTIAL REALLY. OFFERING HIGHER QUALITY YOU KNOW FOR THE STUDENTS YOU KNOW WE'VE ACTUALIZED AREAS THE ANSWER TO PHARMACY TECHNICIAN FOR EXAMPLE. OR LET'S SAY YOU ONLY OFFER A PHARMACY TECHNICIAN COURSE BECAUSE HOPEFULLY WE'VE GOT THE DEMAND SIDE OF THIS THING FIGURED OUT. AND YOU ONLY NEED ONE EVERY THREE YEARS. TO MEET THE DEMAND HOW HOW WOULD YOU. HIRE AND RETAIN THE TEACHER IN A CASE TO TWELVE SYSTEM. TO TEACH SAYS SORT OF COURSE [inaudible] WHEN? COMMUNITY COLLEGE MAY BE ABLE TO BRING SOMEBODY ON TO BRING A MAN TO TEACH I MEAN I'M I'M JUST THINKING. THE SYSTEM PROBABLY WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE SYSTEM CONSISTENT WITH THE POLITICS OUTSIDE OF THIS BUILDING AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT GOES ON INSIDE OF K. THROUGH TWELVE DISTRICTS. TO FIGURE OUT IF THERE'S A WAY TO MAKE THIS A LITTLE MORE AGILE WITHOUT STEPPING ON ANYBODY'S TOES AND MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE PROPERLY CREDENTIALED AND AND AND MY MAKING SENSE I MEAN FOR EXAMPLE IF YOUR C. D. E. PROGRAM YOU HAVE YOUR TEACHING. SOMEONE YOU YOU NEED TO TRAIN SOME PEOPLE IN THE ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAM. AS OPPOSED TO WHATEVER WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER. IN IN COMPUTERIZED LOGISTICS WAREHOUSE MANAGEMENT. WHAT I NEED? TO TEACHING CREDENTIAL AND I'M GOING TO DO IT IN THE CASE YOU TO ON THE CASE TO TWELVE CAMPUS DO I NEED A TEACHING CREDENTIAL FOR THAT YES YOU DO. AND WHAT SORT OF BURDEN DOES THAT IMPOSE ON A CASE TO TWELVE DISTRICT IF THEY NEED TO HIRE A CASE TO TWELVE INSTRUCTOR WITH THE TEACHING CREDENTIAL TO TEACH A COMPUTERIZED. LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT COURSE. ONCE EVERY TWO YEARS. IF THEY WOULD CREATE A LARGE BURDEN ON THAT ON THAT DISTRICT HOWEVER. TO TEACH A C. T. E. PROGRAM ON THE K. TWELVE DISTRICT YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE. A STANDARD KATE. TWELVE CREDENTIAL YOU WOULD HAVE A DESIGNATED SUBJECTS CREDENTIAL WHICH MEANS THAT YOU'RE AN EXPERT IN. THAT AREA THAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE FIELD EXPERIENCE AND WORK EXPERIENCE. IN THAT AREA OF LOGISTICS SO THAT YOU ARE AN EXPERT IN YOUR BRINGING THAT INFORMATION TO THE STUDENTS HOW EASY IS IT TO GET THAT SORT OF CREDENTIAL IT'S VERY CHALLENGING AND I KNOW THAT MICHELLE MACINTOSH COULD HAVE SHARED THAT. CD INCENTIVE GRANT WILL AS WELL I GUESS THAT'S WHAT I'M SUGGESTING CHALLENGING TOO BECAUSE WE WE CAN'T IT'S HARD TO BE COMPETITIVE SALARY WISE. WE CAN'T WE'RE NOT GONNA SOLVE THAT PROBLEM TODAY BUT I I DO THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT. AND HAVE BRING ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS TO THE TABLE INCLUDING THE ONES THAT ARE PROTECTIVE OF CREDENTIALING AS THEY SHOULD BE. ABOUT TO MAKE SURE THAT IN APPROPRIATE CASES WE HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY. TO TEMPT IN THE SPECIALIZED AREAS NOT ESL NOT. SOME OF THE OTHER AREAS THAT ARE TRADITIONALLY. IN THE CASE YOU TWELVE ENVIRONMENT. BRING SPECIALIZED PLAYERS TO THE TABLE SO WE'VE WE'VE THE NEEDS OF ADULT STUDENTS AND THE NEED OF FOLKS IN THE MARKETPLACE. JUST ADD. ANOTHER EXAMPLE MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED. DIFFERENCE IN FEES IN COURSE FEES. THESE ARE TWO SYSTEMS ADULT EDUCATION COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT BIT AND CO EXISTED IN KIND OF PARALLEL TRACKS. FOR DECADES AND NOW LET YOUR LEGISLATURE RECENTLY MADE THE DECISION. TO TO HAVE THEM WORK TOGETHER CONSORTIA AND TO TO LEVERAGE EACH OTHERS COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGES AND STRENGTH TO WORK TOGETHER. IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT AND IT'S AND THERE STILL ARE INEQUITIES AROUND THE STATE FOR STUDENTS BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T FULLY AID AS A STATE WE HAVEN'T FULLY INTEGRATED. THESE PROVIDERS YOU TO BE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER AN EXAMPLE IS WITH THE COURSE FEES STICKING WITH THE EXAMPLE OF THE CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANT. PROGRAM [inaudible] FOUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES THEIR NON CREDIT ADULT INSTRUCTION THEY ARE PROHIBITED BY LAW FROM CHARGING COURSE FEES. WERE AS FOR FOR ANY OF THOSE ADULT EDUCATION COURSES BUT FOR FOR THE K. TWELVE ADULT SCHOOLS THEY ARE PERMITTED TO CHARGE COURSE FEES FOR CORRECT TECHNICAL EDUCATION. SO FOR A CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANT YOU ARE SOMETHING WE LOOK AT IS YOU GO -- TO SAY LONG BEACH AND A CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANT PROGRAM AT LONG BEACH CITY COLLEGE -- NEARBY COMMUNICORP WHICH WOULD BE FREE TO THAT STUDENT BUT IF THEY GO THROUGH THE ADULT SCHOOL COULD COST. A THOUSAND MORE DOLLARS IN FEES TO GO THROUGH THAT PROGRAM. IN IN THE SAME AREA ANY ADULT SCHOOLS WILL TELL YOU NOT THEY DON'T CHARGE BECAUSE THEY WANT TO THE CHARGE BECAUSE THEY DO NOT GET AS MUCH MONEY STATE MONEY. FOR INSTRUCTION AS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. TO AS MY COLLEAGUE. MISS KING MENTIONED. YOU DO NOT HAVE WE DO NOT HAVE A SET AMOUNT. PER STUDENT A STANDARD AMOUNT PER STUDENT CURRENTLY IN THE COMMITTEE COLLEGES VERSUS ADULTS% SCHOOLS YOU HAVE WERE ALL OVER THE MAP ON ON THE ADULT SCHOOLS AND WHAT THEY GET FUNDED NOT IT'S NOT. EIGHTY EIGHT RIGHT CORRECT THEY GET THEY GET A AN AMOUNT TO THE CONSORTIUM THE CONSORTIUM DECIDES. HOW MUCH THE PROVIDERS GET THE PROVIDERS? A SERVICE STUDENTS THEY CAN SERVE AS MANY AS THEY CAN. IN ANY WITH THE ADULT SCHOOLS AND SO YOU REALLY DO HAVE DIFFERENCES DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES DIFFERENT FEES CHARGED DIFFERENT FUNDING AMOUNTS PROVIDED TO THE TO THE ADULT EDUCATION. ENTITIES JUST DEPENDING ON WHETHER THEY'RE AN ADULT SCHOOL COMMUNICATION WHERE THEY ARE SO JUST ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF SOME OF THE INEQUITIES THAT EVENTUALLY LEGISLATURES GONNA NEED TO GRAPPLE WITH I THINK. TO WE THINK IN ORDER TO TO REALLY HAVE A SYSTEM THAT'S COHESIVE COHERENT WORKING TOGETHER IN A COLLABORATIVE WAY SO IS THE SOLUTION TO STANDARDIZE THE APPROACH OR TO GIVE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE IS THE SAME DISCRETION THAT THE CASE YOU TWELVE OPERATION AND WE THINK THEY DID. THE BEST WAY FORWARD WOULD BE TO STANDARDIZE THE FEET TO THE TO ASSURE THE ADULT SCHOOLS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GET A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FINDING. OF GENERAL FUND AMOUNT AND HAVING MORE MORE THE STANDARDIZATION LIKE WE HAVE CURRENTLY WITH CANELO SHE'S UNITY COLLEGES TO RECOVER COST. WELL CURRENTLY THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES GET ENOUGH FUNDING. FROM THE STATE AND AND AND AND JUST OVERALL FUNDING THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE INSTRUCTION SERVICES STUDENTS WITHOUT CHARGING THAT FEE WHERE IS THE ADULT SCHOOLS. NOT NECESSARILY THE CASE THEY HAVE TO CHARGE FEES. TO TO MAKE UP FOR THAT THE LACK OF FUNDING ARE CURRENTLY GETTING IN MANY CASES. I'LL LEAVE THAT TO THE FIRST FLOOR. ANYTHING ELSE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. I DON'T THINK I HAVE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR PRESENTATION AND LOOK FORWARD TO FURTHER DISCUSSIONS ON THIS ISSUE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LET'S GO AHEAD AND TAKE A PUBLIC COMMENT. LIKE A REAL OKAY. EVERYBODY CUED UP SO THIS IS A PUBLIC COMMENT I NORMALLY DON'T -- SET TIME LIMITS BUT I WOULD ASK YOU TO LOOK BEHIND YOU AND SEE THE LENGTH OF THE LINE SO. BRIEF IS BETTER IF YOU CAN YES MA'AM.

I'M TEACHING THEM THE OPS STUDENT AND I'M HERE TO SAY THAT IT HAS BEEN A BIT OF ME. A LOT WELL SERVICES THAT THEY PROVIDE IN. YES IF YOU COULD GO KEEP CHARGING AHEAD. HI MY NAME IS CAROLINE I'M FROM SAN JOAQUIN DELTA COLLEGE AND I'M ANOTHER ETHIOPIA'S STUDENT. AND MY BACKGROUND IS IN BUSINESS AND EDUCATION. AND THIS PROGRAM HAS HELPED ME OUT A LOT I'M THE FIRST -- GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENT TO BE ABLE TO ATTEND COLLEGE IS A GREAT THING SINCE I WAS A CHILD I ALWAYS KNEW I WANTED TO ATTEND COLLEGE SO THIS IS A GREAT PROGRAM IT PROVIDES TEXTBOOKS AND SUPPORT SERVICES. AND I REALLY THINK HIS IS A GREAT PROGRAM AND THE FURTHER FUNDING WOULD HELP. OTHER STUDENTS. WE'LL DO THE BEST WE CAN KEEP PLUGGING. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. YES MA'AM HI GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS PAULA JASSEM UPS DIRECTOR OF INTER COLLEGE I'M HERE SPEAK UP ON BEHALF UPS ALSO -- SENATOR ALQUIST AUTHOR ANNE GENIUS LEGISLATION THAT RESULTED IN UPS REGULATIONS. THAT NOT ONLY RULING IDEAL PS PROTECTED UPS HAS BEEN ACCOUNTABLE AND CONTINUES TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN SERVING STUDENTS. THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCES OFFICES A PROPONENT OF FLEXIBILITY IN ITS OVERSIGHT OF THE SYSTEM. THIS FLEXIBILITY SMACKS TO SOME OF US AS NO ACCOUNTABILITY. IS THIS FLEXIBILITY WHAT HAS LED US TO MILLIONS OF SHORTFALL IN OUR SYSTEM. WE HAVE YET TO SEE REAL RESULTS MY CHANCES OFFICE INITIATIVE THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE SCRUTINY ACCOUNTABILITY AS TO WHERE THE THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE LANDING OR WHERE THE OR WHAT THEY ARE CHEATING. WE ASK FOR YOUR CONTINUED SUPPORT OF UPS IT WORKS IT HAS BEEN ACCOUNTABLE WE ASK THE COUNCIL'S OFFICE IS ALSO HELD ACCOUNTABLE. WE ASK THAT YOU -- PSP KEPT WHOLE NOT SUBJECT TO TITLE FIVE REGULATORY CHANGES CONSOLIDATION BLOCK GRANT FUNDING. OR ANY OTHER DESTABILISATION THANK YOU THANK YOU MA'AM THANKS FOR JOINING US YES MA'AM. A LITTLE TALLER -- GOOD AFTERNOON -- MISTER CHAIRMAN -- MY NAME IS DOLLY KING I AM REPRESENTING THE FACULTY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES ALSO NOTICE BACK -- I JUST WANNA SAY THAT WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED COLA AND SIGNIFICANT CASTERS CONTRIBUTIONS -- WE'RE ALSO APPRECIATIVE AS WILLIAM WILLINGNESS TO PAUSE AND TO REVISE THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA -- BACK ALSO APPRECIATES THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE FOR ONGOING FUNDING FOR FULL TIME FACULTY IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. I WILL CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE FOR OF FULL AND PART TIME FACULTY -- THE INCREASE INVESTMENT WILL ALLOW US TO MAKE MORE PROGRESS ON RECRUITING HIGH QUALITY AND DIVERSE FACULTY INTO OUR COLLEGES WHICH NEEDS TO BE A TOP PRIORITY -- NOW SO DURING LAST YEAR'S BUDGET CONVERSATIONS BACK HAD SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS WITH THE FUNDING FORMULA. SPECIFICALLY WITH THE PERFORMANCE BASED METRICS. THAT WOULD DELIVER UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THE GREATEST SYSTEM OF WINNERS AND LOSERS. THESE CONCERNS ARE NOW. AS THE FORMULA HAS ALREADY PROVEN TO BE FINANCIALLY UNSUSTAINABLE AND UNPREDICTABLE -- WE UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE IN THIS PROCESS HOWEVER WE CANNOT DELAY MAKING THE NECESSARY CHANGES TO THE FORMULA I MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT PERFORMANCE BASED FUNDING WILL NEVER BE THE BEST APPROACH FOR STUDENTS -- FINALLY WE CONTINUE TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT THE FULLY ONLINE COLLEGE. AND DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IS THE BEST INVESTMENT FOR STUDENTS. THERE ARE CURRENTLY FACULTY WHO'VE BEEN DEVELOPING BEST PRACTICES CONTENT EXPERIENCE IN PROVIDING ONLINE OPTIONS FOR THEIR STUDENTS OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES. HOWEVER NONE OF THEM WERE INCLUDED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ONLINE COLLEGE. SO NOW THAT NOW WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE FACULTY ON THE OUTSIDE WATCHING AS NO GOOD CONTRACTS ARE ANNOUNCED AND ACCEPTED WITH OUT SO MUCH AS A HEADS UP. DESPITE ALL THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE ON THESE ISSUES MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANKS FOR JOINING US YES MA'AM. GOOD AFTERNOON WHEN I STARTED THIS MIKE REILLY CAN KATE WITH PUBLIC ADVOCATE. AND WE ARE SO EXCITED TO HEAR THE CONVERSATION TODAY AROUND ADDRESSING BASIC NEEDS AND MENTALHEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. AS THE HOPE CENTER SURVEY REVEALED 5260% OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS RESPECTIVELY ARE REPORTING FOOD AND HOUSING IN SECURITY. WE NEED TO STOP GAP MEASURES REAL FINANCIAL AID REFORM AND A STATEWIDE COMMITMENT TO DOING SURVEYS. LIKE THE ONES IN THE HOPE. OF REPORT TO REGULARLY LIFT UP BARRIERS FACED BY OUR FIRST GENERATION LOW INCOME -- STUDENTS OF COLOR. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND THIS COMMITTEE ON THESE VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES THANK YOU THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR FRED JONES ON BEHALF CALIFORNIA BUSINESS EDUCATION ASSOCIATION WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR BUILDING WITH DUAL ENROLLMENT HALF OF MY TEACHERS ARE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE OTHER HALF FOR K.. TWELVE WE'RE ALSO GRATEFUL FOR THIS BODY PUTTING SET ASIDE DOLLARS FOR CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND SEE TAKEN STRONG WORK FORCE. WE THINK THOUGH TO HOLD THESE DOLLARS ACCOUNTABLE THERE NEEDS TO BE CLEAR STATE STAFF STATE OVERSIGHT REGIONALLY LOCATED WHICH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION USED TO DO TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO. THEY NO LONGER HAVE THAT CAPACITY. SO THAT IS ONE THING WE ARE PUSHING FOR ONE SIDE OF THE COIN IS THE DOLLARS THE OTHER SIDE IS THE STAFF TO HOLD THOSE DOLLARS ACCOUNTABLE SO WE'LL DO ALL WE CAN TO WORK WITH YOU IN THAT. GOT IT. THANK YOU. AFTERNOON LEILANI I CANNOT ON BEHALF OF THE CITY EACH APA COALITION OR COALITION HAS BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE C. T. INCENTIVE CURRENT PROGRAM OVER THE YEARS. AND WE SUPPORT CURRENT EFFORTS TO TRY TO PROVIDE ALL OF THE K. TWELVE C. T. FUNDS EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH SEE TECH. WE BELIEVE THAT C. TAKE HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN PROVIDING ONGOING FUNDING TO K. TWELVE PROGRAMS WITH ANNUAL ACCOUNTABILITY THAT ENABLES US TO MAINTAIN. AND IMPROVE CT PROGRAM SYSTEMATICALLY IN A WAY THAT THE INCENTIVE GRANT WAS. ON DESIGNS AND WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE C. TAKE METRICS ARE CLEAR IN FOCUS ON THE ELEMENTS THAT MAKE UP HIGH QUALITY CTP WHICH INCLUDES RELATIONSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGES. FOR ARTICULATION DUAL ENROLLMENT ETCETERA. THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM IN THE MEANTIME WE BELIEVE HAS ONLY ADDED ANOTHER LAYER OF BUREAUCRACY THAT DOESN'T DO. AND THAT DOES NOT ADD VALUE TO HIGHLY EFFECTIVE SEE TV PROGRAMS. AND WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT THE GROUND METRICS WHICH ARE THE SAME AS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAM METRICS WHAT THAT MEANS FOR K. TWELVE PROGRAMS. IS THAT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR PROGRAMS WILL BE DEMONSTRATED FOR MANY YEARS SOMETIMES AS MANY AS FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS BECAUSE THE METRICS OCCUR ONLY AFTER STUDENT COMPLETES COMMUNITY COLLEGE. AND FINALLY HAT -- THE CATO STRONG WORK FIRST PROGRAM METRICS ALSO. DO NOT AND CONSIDER STUDENTS TO ENROLL IN UNIVERSITY APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS ARE OTHER PATHWAYS OUTSIDE OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE AFTER THEY'VE COMPLETED HIGH SCHOOL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. I AM A COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACULTY MEMBER -- I TEACH MATH -- AT YOUR BOW COLLEGE IN HAYWARD MY NAME IS DAVE OKAY I'M ALSO THE PRESIDENT OF THE SHIP -- LAST PROCEED AS FACULTY ASSOCIATION. I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE FUNDING FORMULA AND SPECIFICALLY THE SUPPLEMENTAL ALLOCATION APART THAT'S BASED ON FINANCIAL AID. AND I APPRECIATE THE DESIRE TO DEVOTE 20% OF FUNDING TO RECOGNIZE AND SUPPORT LOW INCOME STUDENTS. BUT 20% IS A VERY LARGE SLICE GIVEN THAT IT WAS SET UP IN ESSENTIALLY TO ROB PETER TO PAY PAUL. AND I ASK YOU TO WRAP YOUR BRAIN AROUND THE IDEA THAT UNDER. THE SUPPLEMENTAL ALLOCATION SOME DISTRICTS WILL LOSE AS MUCH AS WHILE OTHERS WILL GAIN AS MUCH AS A 10% WHEN FULL THAT IS ALMOST A 20% SWING IN THE NUMBERS THAT I PASSED OUT OR TO TO SUPPORT THAT CLAIM. THE LOSER DISTRICTS TEND TO BE IN HIGH CST REGIONS -- WHERE IT IS HARDER FOR STUDENTS TO QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL AID -- AND THAT IS IT IS THE CASE EVENWHEN STUDENTS. WE STILL HAVE STUDENTS WHO DON'T QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL AID EVEN THOUGH THEY FACE FOOD AND HOUSING AND SECURITY SO THERE'S A BIG DISCONNECT THERE THAT WERE THERE. IS STILL EXIST AND IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT'S GONNA GET CLOSE BY THE FUNDING FORMULA. BUT IN HIGH COST REGIONS THOSE DISTRICTS ALSO HAVE HIGHER STAFFING COSTS AND WHILE MOST OF THESE DISTRICTS ARE ON HOLD HARMLESS FOR THE MOMENT -- THE CLIFF IS LOOMING IF THIS FLAW IS NOT FIXED MANY OF THESE DISTRICTS WILL BE FORCED INTO DRACONIAN CUTS AND ALL OF THEIR STUDENTS WILL SUFFER INCLUDING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS. WITH THE SUPPLEMENTAL ALLOCATION WAS INTENDED TO SUPPORT NOW I'VE DONE SOME WORK ON AS A MATH GUY DO AT WORK ANALYZING BUDGETS FOR DISTRICT AND SO ON I'VE ACTUALLY TRIED MODELING SOME SUPPOSE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FIXES TO THIS PROBLEM AND IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THAT HARD TO DO. I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A PRICE TAG ASSOCIATED WITH IT BUT I I ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT THE THE COST FOR FIXING THIS IS LESLIE VAN EXTENDING THE CURRENT HOLD HARMLESS IN PERPETUITY. SO THEY CAN BE DONE FOR LESS COST THAN THAT -- BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO FIX THIS OTHERWISE A LOT OF STUDENTS WILL SUFFER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO COME DOWN AND TALK TO US. YES MA'AM. I AFTERNOON TERASA AND THANK YOU FOR THE COMMITTEE FOR AN EXCELLENT -- AND THOROUGH ANALYSIS MY NAME IS LIZ THAT NEVER IT AND WITH THE MYTHOLOGY CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA IN COLLEGE DISTRICTS -- WE FIRST ONE IN A MENTION THAT WE ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE STRONG COAL THAT IS PROVIDED AND APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH -- TO PERSON STIRS SPECIFICALLY THAT PERSON THE SISTERS CONTRIBUTION -- AND WE SUPPORT THOSE MEASURES WE DO WANT -- TO MENTIONED THAT IN THE LETTER THAT WILL BE WE'VE PROVIDED THE OUTLINE A FEW SENSIBLE MODIFICATIONS TO THE US STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA. ONE OF THE KEY ONES THAT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS THAT WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT THE TOTAL COMPUTATIONAL REVENUE. FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN PLUS THE COLA BE ADOPTED AS A NEW BASE FOR DISTRICTS AS A WAY OF A STABILIZING DISTRICTS -- FROWNED AT FUTURE LOSSES -- AND WE OUTLINE IF IF YOU OTHER MODIFICATIONS WERE ALSO VERY CONCERNED WITH A PROPERTY TAX REVENUE -- ESTIMATES THAT WERE HIGHER THAN WAS ACTUALLY ALLOCATED TO DISTRICTS AND WE HOPE THAT THE MAY REVISE THAT CAN BE CORRECTED -- SO THAT CUTS TO SERVICES ARE NOT MADE -- AND THAT WE DON'T HURT STUDENTS THAT WERE ACTUALLY TRYING. TO HELP. AND THEN LASTLY I'LL MENTION THAT -- SIMILARLY TO YOU WE ARE VERY PERPLEXED WITH THE APPROACH THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN TO A FACILITY SPENDING AND THE SLOW RELEASE OF PROP FIFTY ONE RESOURCES. COLLEGES ARE EXPERIENCING FOR MONTHS WHICH MEANS THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY TAXPAYERS ARE GETTING LESS. FROM ON WHAT THEY INVESTED IN CALIFORNIA AND THE COLLEGES AND WHAT WILL ACTUALLY BE THE RESULT SO WE URGE THAT YOU. FIND ALL THE PROJECTS THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE CAPITAL OUTLAY PLAN ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANKS FOR JOINING US. MR JOURDAN'S KHAKI ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL FOR ADULT EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA DOLE ASSOCIATION. BOTH K. TWELVE ADULT EDUCATION PROVIDERS IN THE STATE -- COUPLE THINGS WITH REGARD TO THE CREDENTIALING ISSUE AND YOUR QUESTIONS I'VE REACHED OUT YOURSELF TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT WE DO HAVE A A SIMPLY BE A VEHICLE OF SOME LEGAL SIXTEEN FIFTY EIGHT BY SOMETHING MEMBER WOULD AGREE -- SO WE'RE WORKING ON THAT ISSUE I WITH REGARD TO FUNDING I WOULD THERE HAS BEEN SOME OPPORTUNITIES ARE PROVIDED -- PROVIDERS ARE GIVEN THE FLEXIBILITY -- BUT THERE ARE STILL SOME ONGOING DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THAT. WITH REGARD TO FEES I'M IN THE CONTEXT OF A BUDGET PROPOSAL WE HAVE BEFORE THE COMMITTEE. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON AND THE ASSEMBLY I WOULD REQUEST AN ADDITIONAL ONE HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS. THAT INCLUDES PERFORMANCE BASED FUNDING TO SERVE HARD TO SURVIVE AND HIGH NEED POPULATIONS ADDITIONALLY ANOTHER THIRTY MILLION IT AS PART OF THAT. HUNDRED TEN TO ADDRESS THOSE C. T. E. FEED RELATED ISSUE AND PROVIDE SOME OPPORTUNITIES TO LOWER FEES FOR OUR STUDENTS. ADDITIONALLY THE FINAL COMPONENT OF THAT HUNDRED TEN MILLION IS FIFTY MILLION TO HELP COVER INCREASING COSTS ASSOCIATE WITH PURRS STIRRERS WHAT HAVE YOU AS WELL AS TO GROW CAPACITY IN THE ADULT EDUCATION SYSTEM ALTHOUGH WE GREATLY APPRECIATE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN ADMINISTRATIONS INCLUSION OF A COLA AS PART. OF THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR ADULT EDUCATION TACKLE IS UNFORTUNATELY NOT -- ADDRESSING THE COST INCREASES WHICH RANGE BETWEEN FIVE AND 10% EACH YEAR FOR ADULT SCHOOLS ABSENT ADDITIONAL FUNDING ARE THEY ARE IN THE POSITION WHERE THEY'RE MAKING CURRENT BUDGET YOUR CUTS TO PROGRAMS. OR AT MINIMUM HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT FOR THE FOLLOWING YEAR WHICH MEANS SOME OF THE MOST MARGINALIZED ON IMMIGRANT STUDENTS WHO NEED CITIZENSHIP YES CELL PATHWAYS. HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED SOME WITH MY SHORT TERM CAREER TRAINING IN BASIC SKILLS AND I COULD GO ON THAT SO APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THAT REQUEST WE ARE FOLLOWING UP WITH STUFF GOOD THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MATT PATTON FROM THE CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURAL TEACHERS ASSOCIATION WE ARE VERY APPRECIATIVE AND SUPPORTIVE OF THE CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION MONEY. BOTH K.. TWELVE STRONG WORK FORCE AND THE C. TWO DOLLARS THAT ARE IN THE BUDGET.

THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA TO HELP SUPPORT PROGRAMS AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE USING THEIR DOLLARS EFFECTIVELY. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANKS FOR JOINING US [inaudible] YES MA'AM. AFTERNOON STEPHANIE GOLDMANAT THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE ASSOCIATION FOR OCCUPATIONAL EDUCATION REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE SUPPORT FOR THE CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION SIDE OF THINGS -- BUT WE ARE PRETTY CONCERNED ABOUT STRONG WORK FORCE. AND THE FACT THAT SOME OF THAT MONEY IN THIS PROPOSED BUDGET IS COMING FROM ONE TEN SETTLE UP FUNDS. MOST NOTABLY WERE CONCERNED THAT THERE MAY BE AN ISSUE. A CHILLING EFFECT FROM THOSE COMING FROM ONE TIME FUNDS -- AND WE WONDER WHERE THOSE FUNDS WOULD COME FROM IT NEXT YEAR WOULD ALSO LIKE TO MEET OUT AT SOME POINT WITH YOUR OFFICE IN THE OTHER OFFICES THAT SIT ON THIS COMMITTEE TO DISCUSS SOME OF THE DATA ISSUES [inaudible] AT THANK YOU SO MUCH AGAIN FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND THE QUESTIONS YOU ASKED ABOUT TRUMP. LOOK FORWARD TO MEETING WITH YOU YES SIR. NICOLAS JARVIS ON BEHALF OF LONG BEACH COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT THEN MONICA COLLEGE LOS RIOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT IN SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY COMMUNITY AND THE MORE OF THE LA AS RECOMMENDATION.

TWO NINETY ONE THANK YOU. THANK YOU [inaudible] YES SIR. GOOD AFTERNOON SURE OFF MANY RODRIGUEZ ON BEHALF OF THE EDUCATION TRUST WES YOU TOUCH ON A FEW THINGS FIRST. WE S. LEGISLATURE TO SUPPORT FUNDING FOR ENROLLMENT GROWTH A SECOND AS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD WE BELIEVE WE CAN DO MORE TO COVER THE BASIC NEEDS OF OUR CLINICAL STUDENTS -- SPECIALLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE DATA COMING FROM THE HELP CENTER'S REAL COLLEGE SURVEY SO REALLY HOPING TO TAKE LEE ON THAT. PART. THIRTY TWO W. SUPPORTS THE STUDENTS CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA AND IT'S EQUITABLE AND TEND TO FOCUS ON STUDENT SUCCESS PARTICULARLY FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND STUDENTS OF COLOR -- WE REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO MORE DETAILS ON HOW THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE WILL ADDRESS DATA QUALITY ISSUES -- AND THE LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY OF THIS WE STAND READY TO HELP OUT IN ANYWAY POSSIBLE. FOURTH WE APPRECIATE THE ALLEY AS VERY HONEST ANALYSIS OF THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE PROGRAM WE VIEW THIS PROGRAM AS A STRATEGY AIMED AT COLLEGE AWARENESS AND ACCESS. UNFORTUNATELY COLLEGES WERE NOT USING THE FLEXIBILITY PROVISION WITHIN THAT LAW -- ARE PRIORITIZING THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS WHO WHO DO NOT HAVE AS HIGH A NEED -- SO WE ASK LEGISLATURE TO DEMAND MORE AND BETTER DATE ON HOW THESE FUNDS ARE BEING USED AND LASTLY WE SUPPORT -- CENTER LABORS AS SPEAK TO ANYONE THINKING. THANKS FOR JOINING YES MA'AM. GOOD AFTERNOON REBECCA CURLY ON BEHALF OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACILITY COALITION TO SPEAK TO THE CAPITAL OUTLAY ITEM. WE URGE YOU TO FIND ALL THIRTY NINE OF THE NEW PROJECTS THAT WERE RECOMMENDED BY THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IN THEIR SPENDING PLAN WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT IT'S APPROPRIATE TO PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS OFF OF THAT PLAN. BUT WE ALSO ECHO THE CONCERN THAT DISTRICTS ARE VERY CONFUSED BY THE TWO COMPETING STANDARDS ON PRIORITIZING PROJECTS. WHEN VOTERS APPROVED PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE THEY APPROVED TWO BILLION DOLLARS -- FOR MORE THAN JUST HEALTH AND SAFETY PROJECTS THE LANGUAGE IN THE BOND ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT CONSTRUCTION RENOVATION RECONSTRUCTION OF QUIPPING. OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS SO THAT CERTAINLY BROADER THAN JUST HEALTH AND SAFETY. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IS REALLY IN THE BEST POSITION TO ASSESS THE SYSTEM'S FACILITY PRIORITIES FROM THAT STATE WIDE PERSPECTIVE. LASTLY YOU ARE ON THE ISSUE OF INCORPORATING VISION FOR SUCCESS METRICS. INTO THAT EVALUATION AND PRIORITIZATION PROCESS WE JUST URGE YOU TO BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT USING NON FACILITIES FACTORS -- WHEN YOUR FUNDING CAPITAL OUTLAY ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE SO MUCH DATA AND INFORMATION ABOUT THE ACTUAL CONDITION? ALL OF OUR SITES WE USE THE FUSION SYSTEM TO UPLOAD OF VERY MY NEW TO DETAIL ABOUT THE CONDITION OF ALL OF OUR FACILITIES. THANK YOU THANK YOU. SIR.

AND THEY FEEL LIKE THE RULES OF THE GAME HAVE BEEN CHANGED ON THEM. ON THE BUDGET -- ONE THE NEW STUDENT SUCCESS FUNDING FORMULA ONE SUGGESTION THAT WE WOULD MAKE WOULD BE TO LOOK AT THE EQUITY ALLOCATION. BY COLLEGE AS OPPOSED TO DISTRICT THERE TOUCH POINTS ON THOSE STUDENTS AT EACH COLLEGE THAT THEY ATTEND. THE OTHER THING IS WE SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR THE INCREASE IN E PROMISE. PROGRAM -- IT REALLY CREATES A COLLEGE GOING CULTURE AT EACH OF THOSE LOCAL AREAS -- FINALLY -- WE WOULD ASK THAT YOU LOOK AT NON CREDIT AND CHANGING THE ACCOUNTING MECHANISM FOR NON CREDIT FROM CENSUS STATE -- FROM POSITIVE ATTENDANTS TO CENSUS DATE THANK YOU [inaudible] YES MA'AM. GOOD AFTERNOON I THINK IT IS MISTER TURNER CALL RICE WITH THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION -- ALSO WE ARE PROUD TO BE THE CO CHAIRS OF THE GET REAL COALITION REAL STANDING FOR RELEVANCE IN EDUCATION AND LEARNING ALONG WITH OUR PARTNERS FROM THE CONSTRUCTION BUILDING TRADES -- JUST WANTED TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE THOUGHTFUL CONSIDERATION AND DELIBERATION ON ALL THE ISSUES PARTICULARLY ON THE KERR TAKE EDUCATION INCENTIVE GRANT AND ALSO -- THE PROGRAM'S INCORPORATION TO THE STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAM OF WE ALSO AGREE WITH THE CHAIRMAN RELATED TO THE DEMAND SIDE OF THIS EQUATION AS INDUSTRY WE ARE INTERESTED IN MAKING SURE THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE LINING WITH THE REGIONAL NEEDS. AND THAT THE PROGRAM DELIVERY AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPMENT IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THOSE JOB NEEDS ARE IN THE REGION.
