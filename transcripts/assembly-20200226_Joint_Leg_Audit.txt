SO I WANT. TO THE COMMITTEE THAT DEPEND. ON MANY CUBA PROOF TODAY. WE WERE HAVE RESOURCE AVAILABLE FOR YOUR AUDITS THAT THE LEGISLATURE ASKED TODAY. WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO IT UP MR CHILDREN IN HE WILL SAY AS AT WE'LL KEEP IT TO. TWO TO MINUTES. ARE TALKING OF ARE LOCAL PROGRAM IN THE F. AFTER. THROUGH UP TOGETHER THE DATA. PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU RIGHT MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE AS MISS IN THE ON THE TALK TO YOU BRIEFLY ABOUT OUR LOW HIGH RISK FOR. WE RELEASE THE DASHBOARD TALKED IN A TERMS BUILDING WHAT WE DO IS WE ANALYZE THE FOR THE HEALTH OF HUNDRED AND SEVENTY pREVIEWING AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION. IN DOING THAT WE EVALUATED THE FISCAL HEALTH OF EACH CITY USING A SET OF TEN FINANCIAL INDICATORS AND THE INDICATORS WERE DESIGNED RIDLEY TO ASSESS EACH CITIES CASH POSITION. OR ABILITY TO PAY ITS BILLS IN THE SHORT TERM OR THE COMING YEAR WE ALSO LOOK AT THE DEBT BURDEN OF EACH CITY ASSESSING ITS ABILITY TO PAY ITS BILLS IN THE LONG TERM. IN RELATED TO THAT WHAT THE SUFFICIENCY OF EACH CITIES FINANCIAL RESERVES THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO COVER ANY UNEXPECTED COSTS. AND WE LOOKED AT REVENUE TRENDS TO SEE IF THE GROWTH IN THOSE REVENUE TRENDS. WOULD KEEP PACE WITH INCREASING COSTS INCLUDING INCREASING RETIREMENT COSTS. FINALLY WE LOOKED AT EACH CITY'S ABILITY TO PAY FOR THE RETIREMENT COSTS OF ITS EMPLOYEES. SO WE WENT THROUGH THE ANALYSIS AND BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE TEN INDICATORS WE CATEGORIZE EACH CITY. AS HAVING LOW. MODERATE OR HIGH FISCAL RISK IN ADDITION WE RANK ALL FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE CITIES. BASED ON FISCAL HEALTH FROM HIGHEST RISK TO LOIS RISK. AND IS MISS HOW INDICATED FOR THE CITIES WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO OUR PROPOSALS TODAY WERE AMONG THE TOP TEN FINANCIALLY RISKY CITIES IN THE STATE. WHAT WHILE THE FIFTH CITY WHICH IS WEST COVINA WAS IN THE TOP TWENTY. SO BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE DASHBOARD AND ARE ON SIDE ASSESSMENTS THAT EACH OF THE FIVE CITIES. WE DETERMINED THAT THE CITIES ARE DEMONSTRATING VARIOUS HIGHER RISK CHARACTERISTICS AND I WANT TO WALK THROUGH THOSE. VERY BRIEFLY. ONE EACH OF THE CITIES IS FACING INCREASING PENSION COSTS NOT ONLY THAT BUT THESE PENSION COSTS ARE VERY HIGH RELATIVE TO THE ANNUAL REVENUES IN EACH CITY COLLECTS. THEY ALSO HAVE SIGNIFICANT LIABILITIES FOR POST EMPLOYMENT HEALTH BENEFITS FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES AND MOST OF THESE CITIES HAVE SET ASIDE VERY LITTLE OR NO FUNDING TO PAY FOR THESE BENEFITS. WE ALSO LOOK THE CASH FLOW AND DETERMINE THAT MOST OF THE CITIES HAVE SIGNIFICANT CASH FLOW PROBLEMS AN INSUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO PAY THEIR BILLS IN THE NEAR TERM. RELATED TO THAT MANY OF THESE CITIES HAVE INSUFFICIENT FINANCIAL RESERVES THAT THEY COULD USE TO FUND THEIR OPERATIONS IN THE EVENT OF A FISCAL EMERGENCY OR ANY KIND OF AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. SOME OF THE CITIES ALSO HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF DEBT. AGAIN RELATIVE TO THEIR ANNUAL REVENUES WHICH IS GOING TO STRAIN THEIR ABILITY TO SERVICE THAT DEBT. AND FINALLY WE TOOK A LOOK AT EACH CITIES REVENUES AND WE FOUND THAT SOME OF THESE CITIES HAVE FLAT OR EVEN DECLINING REVENUES. WHICH IS TROUBLESOME GIVEN THAT THEY HAVE INCREASING COSTS- WITH THAT'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE DASHBOARD. THANK YOU LET ME ASK THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS. SENATE ROTH LEADING MISTER CHAIR I'M JUST CURIOUS TO FIND IN ANY OF THE CITIES THAT ARE IN IN THE HIGH RISK CATEGORY- HAVE USED TO PENSION OBLIGATION BONDS TO ATTEMPT TO DEAL WITH. COSTS OF PENSIONS OTHER POST RETURN BENEFITS. YES WE ACTUALLY DID FIND THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CITIES ACROSS THE STATE IN THE HIGH RISK CATEGORY AS WELL AS IN THE MODERATE RISK CATEGORY THAT HAVE USE PENSION OBLIGATION BONDS TO BASICALLY FIND THEIR UNFUNDED RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS WHEN WE CALCULATE ONE OF OUR INDICATORS ASSESSES THE MAGNITUDE OF THESE UNFUNDED PENSION LIABILITIES AND WHEN WE DO THAT WE INCLUDED. THE PENSION LIABILITY PLUS ANY OUTSTANDING PENSION OBLIGATION BONDS. THE TO THE EXTENT THAT IT. FITS IN WITH YOUR STANDARD PROTOCOL AND THE ISSUES THAT YOU ADDRESS AS A MATTER OF COURSE- WHEN YOU CONDUCT THESE OUT ITS I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN IN- IN READING YOUR- COMMENTARY ON THE EFFICACY. OF PENSION OBLIGATION BONDS- I ASSUME THAT YOU CAN CHOOSE. PERIODS OF TIME WITHIN WHICH THE BONDS ARE ISSUED AND REPAYABLE AND- THAT SORT OF COMMENT AGAIN I DON'T KNOW IF IT FITS WITHIN THE PARAMETERS OF WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU CONDUCT A HIGH RISK GOT IT BUT IF YOU IF IT DOES I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN. IN HEARING FROM. OUR MODERATOR. YOUR VIEWS ON THE EFFORT OF PENSION OBLIGATION BONDS UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF SOME OF THESE CITIES INCLUDING THE HIGH RISK ONCE YOU'RE FACING. IT WOULD ABSOLUTELY BE IN THE SCOPE OF THE AUDITS THAT WE DO AND THAT'S WHY WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE. WHEN WE LAUNCHED THE DASHBOARD THAT WE HIGHLIGHTED THAT INFORMATION FOR YOU. UP THE DATA AND WHERE THEY CAN GO IN AND IDENTIFY CITY ARE BAY. TAKE AN ABA AT. IF A BOND. WHERE THE YOU KNOW A ARE PASSING THAT OP O TO OTHERS AT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A PRACTICE BUT WE WERE AB LOOK AT THAT WHEN WE CAN THE ON AND WOMEN COME MISSED THE AYES THE WITH THE FOR A AND FIFTY WHATEVER IT IS EIGHTY PLUS PLUS IT IS THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MANY OF THEM ARE BUT ONE STEP AWAY FROM THE- HIGH RISK OR ALMOST HIGH RISK LIST AND THEY MIGHT BENEFIT FROM READING YOUR COMMENTS. BEST PRACTICES CERTAINLY CENTER THAT'S WHAT WE WE'RE INTENDING WITH THIS DASHBOARD AND WE HAVE ONE YEAR'S WORTH OF INFORMATION ON THE DASHBOARD AND THE INTENT IS TO HAVE THIS BE A LONGITUDINAL UP RESOURCE FOR CITIES FOR RESIDENTS IN CALIFORNIA TO SEE HOW WELL THEIR CITY IS DOING IS THEY'RE CITY HEADING INTO. A PORT BAD DIRECTION OR ARE THINGS GETTING BETTER SO WE INTEND TO POPULATE THE DATABASE LATER THIS YEAR WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO FINANCES AND WE HOPE THAT CITIES. WILL LOOK AT THE DASHBOARD AND SEE WILL THIS CITY SEEMS TO BE DOING WELL WHAT WHAT ARE THEY DOING DIFFERENTLY THAN WE ARE DOING WHAT ARE THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE THERE THINGS WE COULD LEARN FROM THAT PARTICULAR LATEST THE NORTH HEALT AND HOPEFULLY AS- THE BILL. CALIFORNIA'S WILL TAKE YOUR REPORT WILL SHARED WITH THE OTHER CITIES PARTICULARLY AS YOU. INCLUDE COMMENTARY ON FINANCIAL PRACTICES BEST PRACTICES SOME THAT ARE NOT SO GOOD. I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT'S OKAY I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU DO THANK YOU MADAM ON THANK YOU FOR THE FUTURE. THANK YOU. FOR CLARITY I APPRECIATE THOSE C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; IN&lt;/c&gt;</u> THAT BE BECAUSE THIS IS A CAN DOT IT FROM PREVIOUS CAR. WELL IT'S NOT NECESSARILY CONTINUED AUDIT MISTER CHAIRMAN THE DASHBOARD WAS AN ANALYSIS WE DID WE- MY STAFF MIKE STAFF OUT WENT OUT AND LOOKED AT IT WE WENT TO ALL A LOT OF THE CITY'S WEBSITE WE WENT TO OTHER RESOURCES. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE COLLECTED OPTED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND DID THE ANALYSIS WHAT WERE WHAT THE DAY COMMITTEE WILL BE CONSIDERING TODAY IS AS WE NOTIFIED YOU WE WENT AND SELECTED AS MR CHILDREN INDICATED. SOME OF THE CITIES THAT RANK VERY HIGH AS FAR AS FISCAL DISTRESS A LOT OF THOSE INDICATORS THEY WERE HIGH RISK SO WAY OUR STATUTE WORKS IS WE GO OUT WE NOTIFIED. YOU AND THE AND THE VICE CHAIR THAT WE'RE NOT DOING ASSESSMENT BASED ON THAT ASSESSMENT THEN WE PUT A PROPOSAL TOGETHER. IT WILL STAY AYE. WE THANK. THEY'RE SICK. PROBLEM WE WENT AND GAVE WITH THIS. I DIDN'T HEAR. THAT WERE CAN US THAT THEY HAD EVERYTHING UNDER CONTROL OR HAD ADEQUATE PLANS TO DEAL WITH THEIR FISCAL SITUATION. SO WE THINK IT WOULD BE PRUDENT FOR US TO GET OUT THERE AND CONDUCT AUDIT WORK. AND HOPEFULLY IDENTIFY SOME ISSUES OR SHARE BEST PRACTICES THAT WE'VE SEEN THAT HOPEFULLY WILL BE OF ASSISTANCE TO THE CITIES AND OTHER CITIES THAT. PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT WE'RE DOING GOT IT. AND SO THESE ARE THE- TOP TWENTY MOST CASES THE TOP TEN- HIGH RISK ALREADY IDENTIFIED IN THE DASHBOARD. WHEN WE WHEN WAS THE FIRST HIGH RISK AUDIT CONDUCTED. OR I'D HAVE TO LOOK- WE'VE DONE I THINK FOR. US WE'VE DONE FOR. AUDIT THAT THIS CA HAS APPROVED MISTER CHILDREN INDICATE HE'S THAT THOUGHT THE FIRST WE DID CITY OF HAMMETT MOM AND I THE STATE OF MAY WOOD WERE BOTH CONDUCTED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN OKAY SO THIS ISN'T SOMETHING NEW FOR ALL OF THE CITY'S A SYSTEM THAT'S BEEN AROUND FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS CORRECT CORRECT OKAY GIVE WITHOUT THERE'S A REAL QUESTIONS FROM THE DíAS FOR THE AGENDA ITEM ONE.

AS YOU MIGHT RECALL ON THIS IS THE WORST ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER ON THE WEST COAST THAT WE HAVE NOW BEEN FIGHTING TO CLEAN UP- THIS BODY HAS BEEN VERY GENEROUS- AND WE'RE NOW OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS BUT THERE'S SOME BIG QUESTIONS WE HAVE BASS. NUMBER ONE WHAT TO TAKING SO LONG NUMBER TWO WHY IS THE COST OF BURIED FROM FIFTY FROM THE ESTIMATED FIFTY THOUSAND A PROP NOW EIGHTY THREE THOUSAND A PROPERTY- WE NOW KNOW THAT SOME THAT THE PROCEDURES COULD'VE BEEN DONE THAT. HOW I KNOW THE CAR TO MAKE NOT HELD IN PLACE. AND OF QUESTIONS WE FOLKS. FOLKS OF MEN THAT WE PRINT TO ADD DTS PLEASE QUITE BUT QUITE. ARE THERE'S A BIT THE DISK. AND WE WOULD LIKE THE STATE OUT OF TO AUTO IN GIVE SOME ANSWERS TO WHITES. SO MUCH LENGTH OF TIME AND HOW WE CAN BE IS PUT IN AS WE CAN WITH- PRECIOUS TAX DOLLARS. SAW THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND I'D LIKE TO HAVE SUPERVISED RELEASE ALSO PROVIDE TESTIMONY ON THE NEED FOR THIS. PLACE SUPERVISORS THANKS FOR JOINING US THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND TO THE CHAIR. I ALSO WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER SANTIAGO FOR INVITING ME UP TODAY- OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A VERY CRITICAL ISSUE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS THEIR TAKE FOR THE PAST. YEARS I DO WANT TO. UNDERSCORE THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PROVIDED FUNDING TO PROVIDE HOWEVER WE'VE HAD ISSUES REGARDING THE ADMINISTRATION OF TSC IN TERMS OF HOW THAT CLEAN UP IS CONDUCTED. AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY IN MY OPINION THIS IS OUR FLINT MICHIGAN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IT'S DEVASTATING TEN THOUSAND HEALTH SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN IMPACTED. IN THE SOUTHEAST COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS A STEP HEY- HERNANDEZ AND THE RED. THAT ARE PUT FORWARD NOW I DON'T THINK ARE SUFFICIENT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO ASK FOR DETAILS SEE TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND CONTINUE WITH THE CLEAN UP. AND TO ALSO REVIEW THE TERMS OF AGREEMENTS WITH THE CONTRACTORS BECAUSE AS A- ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAID- THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT. A CONTRACTING OVERHEAD CHARGES AND THAT WILL IMPACT THE CLEAN UP. THAT THEN I THINK CREEK LZ OUT OF HELPING AND HOUSEHOLDS THAT CAN'T BE REVIEWED EFFICIENTLY. AND THE COMMUTE. AND WAITING. MORE THAN TWICE A YEAR THE PLAN HAS BEEN CHAU. WITH THE IMPACT IS WHAT IT A TO. PEOPLE TO WOMEN. IT'S TIME THAT WE TAKE A SECOND LOOK. SEE MY OPINION I UNDERSTAND THE TSC HAS ABOUT NINETY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDS REMAINING THAT ARE ON ALLOCATED. ARE OVER FIFTY YOUR PROPERTIES ROOM TO BE. LOS APPROXIMATELY ONE THOUSAND AND FIFTY. OF PROPERTIES CAN BE CLEANED UP FOR THE NINETY FOUR MILLION IN OUR ESTIMATION. AND IT'S NOT SUFFICIENT FUNDING TO CLEAN UP THE REMAINING FIVE HUNDRED PROPERTIES TO REACH THE INTERIM GOAL OF THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THAT WAS SET BY DE TSC. SO WE KNOW TAT THIS IS A MOVE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IF YOU'LL APPROVED. THIS AUDIT AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ANTI TNC THEY'VE COME DOWN SEVERAL TIMES. TO OUR AREA TO TALK TO CONSTITUENTS BUT I WILL SAY THAT. OF PEOPLE ARE ARE ARE VERY ANXIOUS AND WANT TO SEE REMEDIES WITH A ONE ALSO SEE THAT THERE ARE SOME CULTURAL COMPETENCE THE PROVIDED. THROUGH THE CONTRACTING IS A LIST WITH THE STAFF. BECAUSE YOU DO HAVE MANY MONOLINGUALS SPEAKING END OF IT. AND ARE. ONLY A WILL A WITH THE PATIENTS OF THE CLEAN. AND ALSO OTHER FACT IT STILL. THERE'S A SIX HUNDRED HOUSEHOLDS WERE DTS SEE HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO OUR I'M SORRY. A THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED PROPERTIES THAT HAVE. NOT RECEIVED ADEQUATE ACCESS AGREEMENTS TO BE ABLE TO GO INTO THE PROPERTY TO IDENTIFY THE CLEANUP. AND I KNOW THAT CAN BE HARD BUT AS A COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WERE WILLING TO WORK. WITH THE S. DTS SEE TO HELP FACILITATE THAT BUT WE'VE YET TO HEAR A RESPONSE SO I JUST READ A WRITTEN. REQUEST RESPECTFULLY THAT OU OF.

PARTICULARLY WHEN WITH RESPECT TO PROPERTY OF VALUE BY THE CONTRACT AND THOSE DIFFERENCES REASONABLE WHAT ARE THE FACTORS. BECAUSE THOSE THERE IS. GETTING TO THE DIFFERENT. AS TOXIC SUBSTANCE. ODD IN. PLIED WITH STATE CON. RULES HAVE THEY DONE. THEY CAN COULD OR DID THEY DO EVERYTHING THEY COULD- IN AWARDING THOSE CONTRACTS MAKING SURE THAT THEY GOT THE BEST VALUE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ALSO IN MONITORING THOSE CONTRACTS ARE THEY ENSURING THAT THERE OF TRYING TO AVOID OR CONTAIN ANY COST INCREASES. ALSO HE HAS ASKED US TO LOOK AT THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS WHAT COST IS THE DEPARTMENT TOXICS. SUBSTANCE CONTROL INCURRING IN MONITORING THE CONTRACTS- AND ARE THEY DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO CONTAIN THOSE COSTS AS WELL.

MISTER CENTER OF HIS CHANCE REVIEW GOVERNOR BUDGET WE HAVE BUT LOOK HERE'S WHAT'S ITS AND ALL FRAME WHY THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO US RIGHT BECAUSE WHAT'S AT STAKE IS OUR IS AND I DON'T THINK I THINK I DON'T THINK I HAVE TO CONVINCE ON THAT PART BUT ALL UNDERSTATEMENT THE LAST WHAT'S AT STAKE OUR COMMUNITIES HEALTH BECAUSE WHEN WE STARTED THIS THERE WAS APPROXIMATION OF HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE TO CLEAN. WE NOW PASS THOSE TIMES THERE WAS AN APPROXIMATION OF HOW MUCH EACH PROPERTY COSTS WE HAVE NOW BE GONE BEYOND THAT IT WAS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ONE CONTRACTOR DO CERTAIN PROPERTY FOR CERTAIN COST ABOUT SIXTY ANOTHER CONTRACTOR DOING OF ANOTHER COST ABOUT EIGHTY AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT SOME PROPERTIES. AS THE THREE. ONES WE- OUGHT TO. BUT WHAT WHAT. PERFECTLY THIS BUT PROJECT IT WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY THAT IS NOT WE DON'T BELIEVE IS BEING ADDRESSED WHILE AND WHILE I WHILE I CAN I WELL I UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSES. WE FEEL THAT WE NEED AN INDEPENDENT AUDITOR TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE QUESTIONS WERE SPECIFICALLY REQUESTING TO ENSURE NOT ONLY THAT THE REMAINING DOLLARS ARE SPENT WELL- BUT QUITE FRANKLY GIVE THIS HAPPENS IN ANYBODY ELSE'S COMMUNITY- ANY OF US WHO REPRESENT WE BE DEMANDING THE SAME SORT OF AUDIT. BECAUSE IT THIS CAN HAPPEN IN ANYBODY'S BACKYARD IN THE FACT THAT IT HAPPENED IN OUR BACKYARD LOW INCOME- LATINO NEIGHBORHOODS. BUT WE FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THIS HAPPEN LOOK AT LOOK FOR THIRTY THREE YEARS. EXIDE ALLOWED. DEED FOR X. SORRY DTS HE ALLOWED EXCITE- TO OPERATE UNDER TEMPORARY PERMIT I MEAN THAT THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE BIG RED FLAG WE'VE NOT GONE THROUGH TWO OR THREE FACTORS WILL HAVE A NEW DIRECTOR NOW. WITH A REALLY GOOD OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE A NEW DIRECTOR SHE'S WORKING REALLY HARD TO GET THIS DONE AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL ALL WILL. GIVE HER TOOLS DON'T ARE ALL ON THE WORK OF THE PERSON VOTE FOR THE- TIME AND TO DO THE- TAKE CARE BUT WILL. THEN MOVE FOR AND SPEND LIKE WHY SUPPORT RE ANYMORE DOLLARS CLEAN THIS UP THE END OF THE DAY HEALTH. I DON'T. YOU. WE HAVE TO HAVE THE CONFIDENCE OF THE LET. THE COMPANY OF OUR USE THE MONIES WILL BE. WELL IN THE MOST IF. WAY WHEN IT COMES TO CLEANING UP OUR NEIGHBOR. I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT IME AND QUITE FRANKLY I THINK THE LITTLE BIT LATE THAT WERE HERE. ASKING FOR NOT A FEW YEARS LATER IN. BY CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE GRAVITY OF THE CRISIS AS YOU DESCRIBED ITS- CALIFORNIA'S PLANT. UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE CONTAMINATED WATER SYSTEMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT IS ALSO CALIFORNIA'S FLINT RIGHT. ARM ONE OF MY CONCERNS WE'VE ALLOCATED- GENERAL FUND DOLLARS FOR THIS CLEANUP WHEN. WHAT'S THE STE. WASN'T EXCITED PAYING FOR THIS CLEANUP. THEY ARE WHAT WILL BE WILL BE I MEAN I'LL I'LL GIVE YOU THE VERY HIGH LEVEL UNDERSTANDING. THERE WAS A NON PROSECUTION AGREEMENT THAT WAS SIGNED BACK I BELIEVE IT'S TWO THOUSAND AND- FIFTEEN. THAT AT SOME POINT ONE FOUND CULPABLE- THE X. EXCITE WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE THE DOLLARS TO. BUT FOR THE DOLLARS OF CLEAN UP IN WOULD REIMBURSE THE STATE NOW IF THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN THERE THERE IS A SECOND. A IT WAS A SECOND BILL TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH RIGHT NOW IS CLEANING UP. WITH THE WITH THE DOLLARS HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED. AND I THINK THAT'S I THINK THAT'S A VERY HIGH LEVEL- YEAH BUT IF I CAN JUST ADD ON TO THAT. PLEASE SO THE THROUGH THE CHAIR POLICE- THANK YOU CHAIR I'M SORRY. SO THE US. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FIND A NON PROSECUTION AGREEMENT WITH BACKSIDE. NOT NOT THE STATE DID YOU SEE HAS BEEN ACTIVELY WORKING WITH THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO BUILD A CASE FOR COST RECOVERY AGAINST EXIDE NOT EXCITED FIGHTING US THUS FAR ADMINISTRATIVELY AT EVERY TURN. WE'RE NOT GONNA ACCEPT THAT OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GONNA MOVE FORWARD TO PROSECUTE. COST RECOVERY ACTION AGAINST EXIDE TO RECOVER ALL THE COST THAT WE CAN. WITH THE SCOPE OF THIS ON IT LOOK AT THE STATUS OF. OF THAT IN IN COST REIMBURSEMENT TO THE STATE. THIS QUESTION FOR THE MONITOR NO WE DON'T HAVE I DON'T SEE ANYTHING IN THE SCOPE OF THE HONORED AS FAR AS- COSTA. IT'S REALLY LOOKING AT TOXIC SUBSTANCES AND THEIR ACT ACTIONS WITH RESPECT TO CONTRACT FOR THE CLEAN ACTIVITIES CONTROLLING THE COST ESTIMATING HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE. SO IT'S BASICALLY IN THE SCOPE OF THE AUDIT. RIGHT IT JUST SEEMS LIKE TO GET THE FULL PICTURE THAT WOULD BE A HUMVEE ELEMENT AT. THIS STAGE OF THAT COULD BE A SUPPLEMENTAL WELL COMPONENT IF I MIGHT ADD I I'M SORRY PLEASE SENATOR WE ALL WE ALWAYS HAVE ANYTIME WE CONDUCT AN AUDIT WE ALWAYS HAVE AN OBJECTIVE IN HERE THAT IF THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO THE SUBJECT MATTER. THE FACT YOU'RE BREAKING IT UP IT'S RELEVANT TO THE SUBJECT. SOMETHING WE COULD INCLUDE IN THE SKIN IT WOULDN'T BE A SCOPE MODIFICATION BECAUSE IT'S RELEVANT TO THE ISSUE SO IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN CERTAINLY LOOK AT IF THE AUDITS PRICKED THANK YOU. SHE SO WITHIN. JACK DISMISSED IF YOU COMMENT ON THAT YEAH I WOULD INCUR APPS THAT ALL PART OF THE THAT THAT THE SEGMENT OF THE OF THE WORK IS BEING AUTUMN THAT WE- PROVIDING THE STATE COMPTROLLER.

A CONSENT CALENDARS APPROVAL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR ADDITIONAL MEMBERS TO ADD ON- WITH THAT WILL GO TO RETURN BACK TO THE SANTIAGO IS ITEM I BELIEVE SENATOR GONZALEZ HAS QUESTION THEN MOVED TO CENTER ARTS FOR. I MORE OF JUST A COMMENT I JUST WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU BOTH FOR CONTINUING TO KEEP THE ISSUE ALIVE I KNOW- FURNACE IN MY BACKYARD AS WELL AND I'M NEWER TO THE ISSUE BUT- WITH ALL DUE. RESPECT THIS IS JUST IT'S GREAT THAT WE ARE CONTINUING THE DISCUSSIONS- I THINK THE ONLY. QUESTION I HAD WAS IT SAYS IT'S- THE TSC IS UNCERTAIN AS TO HOW MANY PARCELS WILL ULTIMATELY NEED TO BE CLEANED UP EVEN AS A LEGISLATOR I FEEL LIKE I CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION BUT DO WE HAVE ANY GUESSTIMATES ON WHAT. PERCENTAGE IS. CLEANED UP ALREADY. YEAH SINCE THE CLEANUP PLAN WAS ISSUED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE LATTER HALF OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN. WE CLING OF ABOUT THIRTEEN HUNDRED PARCELS. THAT BRINGS THE ENTIRE AMOUNT A NUMBER PARTIALS CLEANED UP TO OVER SIXTEEN HUNDRED AND FORTY. SO THAT'S PRETTY MUCH AN UNPRECEDENTED CLEAN UP IN THE HISTORY THE STATE IN TERMS RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES TECHNIQUES TO BE DONE AS WELL SO WHAT NEEDS TO BE SO THE LEGISLATURE WHEN THEY PROVIDED THE MONEY. SAID CLEAN UP ACCORDING TO THE THREAT REPRESENTED BY THE MATERIAL ON THE PARTIALS. AND THE POTENTIAL FOR ACTUALLY- THAT THAT HAS A SUBSTANCE THE LEAD IMPACTING HUMAN HEALTH. SO THERE'S NO SET NUMBER OF PARCELS. THAT IS ESTABLISHED IN LAW. WHAT WE THINK WE CAN DO THAT BASICALLY OUR ENGINEERS ESTIMATE SAYS. SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ON AVERAGE PER PARTIALS ABOUT HOW MUCH IT SHOULD COST WE'VE GOT ONE CONTRACTORS SIXTY THOUSAND ANOTHER CONTRACTOR OVER EIGHTY THOUSAND. SO WE WERE STARTING TO SHIFT MORE PROPERTIES TO THE LOWER COST ONE. IN AN EFFORT TO ACTUALLY CLEAN UP MORE PROPERTIES OVER TIME. WITH WE THINK WE CAN GET TO AROUND TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED. BUT THAT'S GONNA VERY A LOT ON THE TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY OF ACTUAL CLEANING UP INDIVIDUAL PARCELS THE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL TAKEN OUT OF EACH PARCEL IT THE WE KIND OF LAID OUT IN IN THAT DOCUMENT FOR YOU. THERE'S A LOT OF FACTORS THAT GO INTO EACH INDIVIDUAL PARCEL ACTUALLY THE COST THAT IT TAKES TO CLEAN IT UP RIGHT. FOR OKAY RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU. SORRY JUST FOR PLEASE CLEAR FONDEST YEAH I'M SORRY IT IS JUST USE A TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED IS YOUR GOAL. OR WEARABLES AS MEN PARTIAL PASTA THE MORE MONEY WE CAN SQUEEZE OUT OF EVERY DOLLAR WE'LL DO IT RIGHT BY. USE MENTIONED. TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED CURRENT PROJECTIONS ARE. THANK YOU.

THE CITY OF COMMERCE ALREADY HAS TWENTY EIGHT CANNABIS LICENSES AND THE PROCESS WITH AN ADDITIONAL TANK CURRENTLY BEING CONSIDERED- RIGHT NEXT DOOR MONTEBELLO WE HAVE TWENTY ONE THAT ARE BEING CONSIDERED.

IS TO COMPARE THEIR CONTRACTING PRACTICES TO PRACTICES THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS BOTH ENDS CON THING MAN. AND STATE IS A STRAIGHT MAN THOSE ARE SENSUAL PRACTICE. IN ADDITION SHE IS ASKING US TO LOOK AT CITY COUNCIL OF THE RESPECTIVE CITY COUNCIL. AND THEIR OVER. OVER THERE STE WHO ARE WORKING THESE CONTACTS. ALSO THING ON THE PERMITTED PROCESS MANY CONTRACT WHAT OF ALL. I BEING CUT LAST LOOK AT US. ARMS LAID OUT IN THE CONTRACT AND DO ARE THEY ENSURING THAT THEY'RE AVOIDING IN ANY TYPE OF A POTENTIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST. AND THEN WITH THE- THE- PERMITTING SIDE.

THE ISSUES FACING THE TOOK ME OR SOME WITH THE- UP. THE PURPOSE OF OUR OF OUR PARENTS THIS MORNING IS TWO FOLD OF FIRST- TO INITIALLY CITY COMMITTEES TO DIAL OF THE RESPECT WE SEE THE COMMITTEES DIAL ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA'S REQUEST. OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE AT THE VERY LEAST YOU DELAY THE CONSIDERATION OF THE AUDIT REQUEST AND ALLOW THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER HER STAFF. AND THE AUDITOR STAFF WITH YOUR CITY STAFF TO DRAW THE QUESTIONS ARE CONCERNED SET FORTH IN THE LETTER DATED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA DATE. JANUARY TWENTY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY. IT'S INTERESTING NOTE THAT LETTER WAS NOT COPY THE CITY OF PARK ALSO NOT COPY TO THE CITY OF COMMERCE. SO WE HAD APPROXIMATELY ONE WEEK IN WHICH TO PREPARE TO ADDRESS THIS COMMITTEE AND TO TRY AND ADDRESS THE- ISSUES OF BRITISH REPLACING THE COMMITTEE. BOB NO I KNOW MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE I BACK ALSO NOTICE SOME OF MEMBER GARCIA AND IT STRUCK ME THAT. AN APPROACH THAT IS MUCH BETTER TO- CONSIDER IS THAT OF INSTEAD OF GOING. DIRECTLY TO THE COMMITTEE IS TO TRY TO MEET WITH YOUR RESPECTIVE COMMUNITIES THAT YOU REPRESENT IN THIS CASE THE CITY OF HUNTINGTON PARK IS OUTSIDE THE JURISDICTION. OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA BUT IT'S STILL A THE CITY OF HUNTINGTON PARK IS STILL OPEN AND WILLING TO MEET WITH HER AND HER STAFF IN THE AUDITOR'S STAFF. IN ORDER TO TRY TO DRAW MINIS IN ORDER TO SAVE TAXPAYER DOLLARS. THE COST OF SUCH AN ODD IT WOULD BE. IS INDICATED IN OVER THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS WELL A I THINK FIFTY YEAH THAT ARE BEING. I'M SURE QUESTION- ARE BEING SOUGHT COULD BE TEST UP. MUCH MORE FIRMLY IN TO GET TO THE SAME CONCLUSION. IN ACTING THE SEVEN. TO OF TEMPLE BURKE. MET BUT HE AUDITORS ARE THEY WERE INITIALLY THE CITY OF PARKING RISK PROFILE WE MET WITH THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE AND AFTER THAT PROCESS STUDENT COMPLETED UP THERE DID NOT MOVE FORWARD ART. WITH RESPECT TO THE K. ISSUES THE CITY FUNDING TO IS ONLY A THREE CANNABIS LICENSE LICENSES OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS- IN FACT THAT MATTER WAS CHALLENGED IN FEDERAL COURT. THE óRDENES OF THIS WAS HAVE UPHELD BY THE FEDERAL JUDGE AND- THE STANCE FOR CONFIRMED BY THE COURTS OF BY THE COURTS. UP WITH RESPECT TO CONTRACT BRIEFLY OF THE CITY'S CONTRA NOT RUBBER STAMP THEY'RE NOT PUTTING CONSENT AGENDA THEY'RE REVIEWED ONE BY ONE BY THE CITY COUNCIL AND I CAN ASSURE THE COMMITTEE. AND ALL INTERESTED PARTIES THAT THE PROPER STEPS ARE BEING TAKEN TO ENSURE THE INTEGRITY. AND THE PARENTS OF APPROVING THOSE CONTRACTS. UP WITH ASKING CLOSING FOR. CAN PARK THE NEGATIVE. IMPACT OF COST TIME EXPENSE TO THREE DAUGHTERS OFFICE OF THE CITY STAFF AND THE BUSINESS ATTRACTION AND RETENTION ISSUES ARE LOSE LOSE LOSE AS OPPOSED TO WHEN. WE ASK THAT YOU RESPECT ME TO THE COMMITTEE TO DENY THE WEST OR EAST TO DISPLAY THIS CONSIDERATION TO ALLOW CITY STUFFED WITH THESE REMEMBERS OFFICE WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY FOR CITY COVERS YEAH THANK YOU SO MUCH- I WOULD LIKE TO START OFF WITH- CONTRACTING PROCEDURES AND JUST TO HIGHLIGHT SOME POINTS THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY FACT THAT ARE VERY RELEVENT- AS TO WHY WE THINK A NOT IT IS NOT APPROPRIATE IN THIS CASE. THE CITY OF COMMERCE HAS BEEN IN A FIGHT BY THE AUDITOR AS A- HAS NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE STATE AUDITOR AS A HIGH RISK MUNICIPALITY- ON THE CONTRARY. I'M GLAD THAT DEPUTY ARE OUR CHILDREN. REFERENCE TO THESE FACTS UP AT THIS HAS BEEN DESIGNATED AS A LOW OVERALL. AND RANKS THREE HUNDRED SO FOURTH. FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE CITIES RACKED WITH THAT THE ARREST CITIES WE HAVE THE LOWEST NUMBER OF FINE. FURTHER THE CITY APPROACHES AUDITED EVERY OTHER CITY AND HAS RECENTLY RECEIVED MARKS. AUDITS WITH A QUALIFY CLEAN UP THIS HAS. BEEN RECOGNIZE AS YEAR'S OVER FIND IT'S. THIS IS THE ASIA PACIFIC BUT SHE- FOR ACCESS TO FIND REPORTING. HI THIS FOLLOWS. PROCUREMENT POLICIES AND HAS NOT HAD ANY REAL ARE COME OF AND BAD ABBE. SINCE THE CITY'S CAN LAW PROGRAM AND A DO TO MAKE CORRECT. I CONCERNING ASSEMBLY GARCIA- I MENTION AS TO HOW MANY A LICENSES THERE HAD BEEN TWENTY NINE LICENSES SAYS THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED AND THAT IS THE- THERE IS THAT THE APPLICATION PROCESS HAS CONCLUDED IN THERE IS NO. A NEAR FUTURE PLANS TO OPEN THE APPLICATION PROCESS- WE WOULD LIKE TO BRING TO LIGHT TO THE COMMITTEE THAT THERE IS ACTIVE PENDING LITIGATION AND THE LA SUPERIOR COURT. ARE CHALLENGING SOME OF THE CITY'S CAN A COMMERCIAL CANNABIS PERMITTING PROGRAM- WE BELIEVE THAT IF THERE'S WOULD BE AN AUDIT THAT IT COULD POTENTIALLY COMPROMISE THIS IS A LEGAL DEFENSE- FURTHER AID I NECESSARILY MAKE CUT- AND THIS UNNECESSARY CAST A NEGATIVE CLOUD- THAT THERE'S SOME SUGGESTION OF WRONGDOING BUT THERE HAS BEEN NO EVIDENCE TO SHOW. AND EVEN THOUGH WE FEEL CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE LITIGATION- SHOULD THAT THAT CASE GO TO CHURCH TRIAL. YOU WILL THAT THIS. BUT GIVE I. I'M UP. TO I THINK THAT TRANSPARENCY IS OF THE CALL THAT WERE MADE AT CITY OF COMMERCE PAINS STAKE IN MATT MATT TO A VERY PROGRAM THE CITIES OR ALONE IS A FOR TWO PAGE OR NAY I'M NOT ONLY DID WE IMPLEMENT ALL OF THIS LICENSE RICK. WHICH BY LAW AND THAT THE OUR MINIMUM STANDARDS BUT WE WENT AHEAD AND MADE ADDITIONAL MORE REQUIREMENTS FROM THE APPLICANTS. ALTHOUGH OUR APPLICATION PROCESS OUR OUR ACTUAL APPLICATION PACKET WITH A TWENTY SIX PAGE APPLICATION PACKET FROM THE INCEPTION AND IN THE SUMMER OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHEN THE CITY STARTED THIS PROGRAM WE DESIGNATED A WEBSITE. AND EVERY ACTION THAT EITHER THE PLANNING COMMISSION WAS TAKEN ANY ACTION THAT THE CITY COUNCIL ACTION WAS TAKEN NOT ONLY WAS IT UNDER A PUBLIC HEARING WHERE WE DID THE PRIOR NOTICING SO THAT EVERYBODY FROM THE PUBLIC HAD THE OPPORTUNITY. BUT EVERY ACTION THAT IS TAKEN AS POSTED ON THE CITY'S WEBSITE IF YOU PRINT THE CITY'S WEBSITE NOW JUST DESIGNATED ON CANNABIS FACTS IT'S ABOUT A TWENTY SIX PAGE DOCUMENT- HAVE ARE TO THE ORDINANCE TO THE APPLICATION ALL OF THE INFORMATION. WAS THAT'S A AND MEANS. ON THE AS WELL. I'M AT AND I IN HE DID I THE CITY OF REQUIRES IT AGREEMENT FROM THE CAN OP. EVERY ALL BUILDING FOR PER EVERY ALL THAT THE MEET ALL STATE REQUIREMENTS AND A BUSINESS LICENSE AND ONLY THEN WILL THE CITY ISSUE A COMMERCIAL CANNABIS PERMIT- THIS THIS PROCESS STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN OF THE SUMMER WERE NOW IN EARLY TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN OUT OF THE TWENTY NINE OPERATORS ONLY THREE APPLICANTS ARE ONLY OPERATING SO TO ME IT JUST SHOWS THAT IT IS A VERY COMPREHENSIVE LONG. AS TO BASED UP START THAT PROCESS AND THE TO ECHO OF THE COMMENTS MADE BY MR GLASSMAN WE TO WE WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA AND HER STAFF FOR HAPPY TO GO OVER ANY OF THE INCREASE IS CONCERNS THAT SHE ASKED. WE JUST MIGHT HAVE THE UPPER. SKIP PROSSER AND COME TO AND TO PUT HAVE ABOUT AND THIS REQUIRE. THAT WOULD BE UNFORTUNATE OKAY THEY YOU. AT THIS TIME OF THE NOTICEABLE COMMENTED WE GOT BOTH CITIES I THINK WE'RE GOOD THIS TIME I'M RETURNING BACK TO THE DíAS ASK FOR- QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE DICE BUT LET ME BEGIN JUST BY ASKING YOU TO THE CITIES. HAS THERE BEEN A BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT THE AUDITS AND YOU MENTIONED THE HIGH RISK GOT ITS BUT CAN I ASK WAS RECIPROCALLY HAS EITHER THE OTHER. EVER DONE AUDIT LOOKING AT JUST THE CONTRACTING OR THE LICENSING OF CANNABIS AND WITHIN THE CITY'S. MISTER CHAIRMAN WITH RESPECT TO HUNTINGTON PARK UP AS I INDICATED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN- WE MET WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE CITY FROM THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE TO REVIEW THE SIMILAR QUESTIONS- EXCLUDING CANNABIS ISSUES. A SIMILAR QUESTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE OF MANAGEMENT OF CONTRACTING WITHIN THE CITY. ARE AFTER CAREFUL REVIEW BY THE STATE AUDITOR BACK IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN IT WAS BE ELECTED NOT TO MOVE FOR BY THE BY THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE. TO TAKE ANY STEPS FOR THE TWO OF A FORMAL AUDIT. OF I GUESS ANOTHER WAY OF RESPONDING MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IS. UP EVERY COUNCIL MEETING THOSE ISSUES ARE ADDRESSED- THEY ARE EXAMINED BOTH BY MR REYES AND HIS STAFF AND ALSO BY THE CITY COUNCIL AND AS I INDICATED. THEY ARE NOT PLACED ON CONSENT THE HANDLED ITEM BY ITEM ON THE CITY COUNCIL CALENDAR ARE NEVER CAME TO ME. THANK YOU. I CAN CAN. HI AND ON MY BE TO THE HIGH RISK PART. OF ACTUALLY HAVE. WELL LET ME. RIGHT WILL TURN IT TO THE ASSEMBLY WELL LET ME START WITH QUESTIONS AND I'M SURE IT'LL COME UP AND QUESTIONS AS WELL- BUT LISTENING TO SET HER OFF THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR YOU KNOW THE FIRST NOTE YOU KNOW THERE APPEAR TO BE SOME PROCESS ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO THIS AUDIT IN TERMS OF NOTIFICATION TO SO MY COLLEAGUES AT LEAST. ONE OF WHOM WHO SITS ON THIS COMMITTEE WHO REPRESENTS THE CITY HERE IN TERMS OF NOTIFICATION OF THE YACHT IT. WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT. SOMEHOW SOME TIME IN ANOTHER WAY BUT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT NOTIFICATION TO THE ROLE RESPONDING CITIES- SIR DID I UNDERSTAND YOU TO SAY THAT YOU ONLY HAD ONE WEEK NOTICE OF THIS AUDIT. QUESTION MR MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND SENATOR THE ANSWER TO THAT IS YES- WE WERE NOT COPIED ON THE ORIGINAL LETTER SO THEY WON'T LET ME FOLLOW WITH THAT THEN SO I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT WE DON'T I DON'T LIKE TO DO BUSINESS THAT WAY. ARE THOSE OF THE OUTCOME. SO WHAT WOULD ADDITIONAL TIME DO FOR YOU AS A CITY IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO RESPOND TO THIS AUDIT REQUEST BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. THIS IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO TELL US WHY YOU NEED MORE TIME. YES MISTER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. IT WOULD GIVE EACH CITY THE OPPORTUNITY TO GATHER THE REQUISITE- DOCUMENTS ORDINANCES AGENDAS OF. THE VERY OTHER ELEMENTS THIS APPROVAL PROCESS AND PRESENT TO THE COMMITTEE AND THEN- AND TO STATE AUDITOR INTO THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN ALSO. THE A COMPREHENSIVE- UNDERSTANDING OF THE STEPS THAT THE CITY'S TAKE IN ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES THAT ARE BEFORE YOU- AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE ADDITIONAL TIME WOULD ALLOW THIS COMMITTEE TO BE. BETTER INFORMED ON EXACTLY WHAT- WHAT STEPS CITIES DO TAKE IN ORDER TO MEET THE QUESTIONS AT HAND. SO WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST A CONTINUANCE OF THE POSTPONEMENT AND WE BELIEVE WE CAN EACH CITY CAN MAKE A COMPELLING A STATEMENT AS TO THE FACT THAT BOTH CITIES ARE IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH STATE LAW WITH AUDITING PROCEDURES AND WITH THE WHAT IS THE GOAL AND OBJECTIVE IS THE- OF THIS COMMITTEE. SO I GUESS MY NEXT QUESTION IS TO THE OTHER PROPONENT GIVEN THE FACT THAT THIS. JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE MEETS ON A REGULAR BASIS DURING THE COURSE OF THE- OF THE YEAR AND WILL DO SO THIS YEAR IS THERE ANY REASON TO. FOR US TO. MAKE A DECISION ON THIS PARTICULAR AUDIT ON THIS PARTICULAR DAY AS OPPOSED TO GIVING THE CITY'S ADDITIONAL TIME TO RESPOND TO THE OTHER REQUEST AND TO GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONSIDER WHATEVER THEY PRESENT I MEAN I'M ASSUMING. YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT THE REQUEST AND I DO YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT THE SITUATION IN THE CITIES AND I DO. YOU'VE JUST HEARD THE RATIONALE FOR WANTING MORE TIME MAYBE THAT HAS VALIDITY MAYBE IT DOESN'T BUT- I GUESS I THINK MY QUESTION THANK YOU SENATOR OFF YES- SELECT TWO ITEMS- TALKING ABOUT BOTH CITIES OFFENSE. THE% HIGH RISK DESIGNATION OR LACK THERE OFF AND IN PART BECAUSE OF ITALY MENTIONED THE WORK WHEN YOU IDENTIFY POTENTIAL IN THE MET WITH THE AUDITOR THE QUESTION I'M ASKING ARE NOT RELATED TO THE HIGHER RISK. A DESTINATION WITH THE AUDITOR CAN EXPLAIN THAT A LITTLE BIT BETTER ON TO DEADLINE A CLARIFICATION. WELL MY QUESTION HAS A HOLD ON IT SO I WILL WILL ANSWER YOUR QUESTION WHICH IS WHY WITH FAMILY LATER NOT IS YOUR PART. BUT I WANTED TO TAKE OPPORTUNITY CLARIFY THAT PIECE OF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU WELL THAT'S FINE I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE SOMEBODY. YEAH I'M A CUSTOM EVERY NOW AND THEN I WILL ANSWER IT WHEN MY OTHER CAREER I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SIT AT THE DíAS AND- GO IN A DIFFERENT SET OF CLOTHES AND- AND SOMEBODY'S THEY NEEDED ADDITIONAL TOP MY LISTEN TO THE RECORD. BEEN DECIDED WHETHER THE ADDITIONAL TIME REQUEST FOR ALL OF THE ORIGINAL THIS WAS REASONABLE AND SECOND WHETHER THE ADDITIONAL TIME REQUEST WAS REASONABLE ON IT WHETHER IT WAS GOING TO LEAD O A MORE PRODUCTIVE. AND I'M DECISION AND SO SOME NEEDS TO. THE LAST ACTUALLY. BUT HONESTLY IN A QUEST SO WILL HAVE ANSWER SECOND I BE ONE NO PROBLEM. SO WE HAVE HAD THE SHORT. SEC IS ONE. THE PART FOR THAT THERE PROCESS CANNABIS. EIGHTEEN IS A COMMERCE STARTED THEIR- ON CANNABIS. NOW WE HAVE THE CITY HUNTINGTON PARK WHEN NEXT. MONTEBELLO STARTING THEIR PA. WITHIN A RELEASE. WINDOW TIME WE'VE HAD. THIS LARGE. OF CANNABIS IN THE COMMUNITY. I AM FOR LEGALIZING REGULATING- AND FOR THESE BUSINESSES FINING HOMES- THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND THAT INCLUDES YOU KNOW MY BACKYARD. ON MAY BE CLEAR THAT. I THINK AT THAT RATE AT WHICH THE GROWTH IS HAPPENING. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ASK THE QUESTION ARE WE USING DESPERATE BEST PRACTICES AS THIS IS GROWING. AND IF WE ARE. THEN GREAT LET ME CONGRATULATE YOU UNLESS MAKE SURE ALL CITIES AROUND THE AREA ARE YOU SEEN THOSE PRACTICES AND THEY WERE NOT. THAT WE EARLY ON THE SIDE OKAY THIS IS NOT HOW WE SHOULD BE YOU KNOW LET'S FIX IT. SO THAT I CITIES ARE LOOKING TO EACH OTHER TO MOVE FORWARD AND BRING IN THIS BUSINESSES. WERE DOING IT IN THE BEST. POSSIBLE WAY- I. I DO NOT KNOW THAT WE NEED TO THE WAITER THAT THINGS ARE GONNA CHANGE WHEN OUR- EXPIRATION IS ABOUT. BEST PRACTICES AND- YOU KNOW IF THE CITIES ARE DOING THAT THEN THEY CREATE A MODEL FOR OTHER CITIES. ARE NOW QUICKLY LOOKING TO EXPAND AT LOOKING AT WHAT NEIGHBORING. ARE GETTING. I THINK THAT THAT GOT WHAT MY- LISTENERS. BY AND IT COULD BE SO. I SHOULD ALSO GET INTO THIS ALONG THE WAY AND SO WE HAVE. THIS DOMINO EFFECT. I TRIED ON. I'M SORRY TO SAY THAT I DIDN'T THAT'S WHAT AT THIS TIME. LET ME SAY THIS I WE DON'T GET MATERIAL VERY EARLY OURSELVES AND WE'RE NOT BEING. TO A STATE AUDIT SO I'M ALL ABOUT DUE PROCESS AROUND HERE AND I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD RECEIVE INFORMATION IN A IN A TIMELY MANNER AND IN A MANNER THAT'S DESIGNED TO GIVE THEM AN ADEQUATE OPPORTUNITY. TO PRESENT THE CASE AS TO WHY WE SHOULDN'T HAVE A STATE ON IT BECAUSE OF COURSE EVERY TIME WE VOTE FOR NOT IT. IT'S SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THREE AND FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OUT OF THE STATE AUDITOR'S BUDGET NOW IF IT'S AN APPROPRIATE ON IT I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT- I. FRANKLY WAS AND I AM PREPARED TO VOTE FOR THIS AUDIT- PROVIDED MY COLLEAGUES WHO- HAD A NOTICE PROBLEM HERE IT. IS OKAY WITH THAT. BUT HAVING SAID THAT I ALSO THINK THAT THE PEOPLE THAT COME BEFORE US I TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THE MATTERS. IN SUPPORT OF THEIR POSITION AND IF PEOPLE ARE GETTING TWO OR THREE DAYS OR FIVE DAYS NOTICE OF ANOTHER REQUEST IN YOUR IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- THAT MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT AND THAT'S- ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT'S WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IT'S AT THIS POINT MORE THE OPTIC TO ME. THAN THE DECISION AND THE DECISION MAY IN FACT BE THE VERY SAME DECISION- THAT ON THE FACE OF IT I'M PREPARED TO MAKE TODAY BUT I CERTAINLY WOULD WANT PEOPLE WHO. DON'T HAVE THAT SAME POSITION TO CAN HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THEIR SO THAT'S THE PURPOSE FOR MY QUESTION AND I'M NOT SURE WHEN- TO BE HONEST MYSELF WOULD COMMITTEE. SENDS OUT THOSE REQUESTS I MEAN THE FOCUSES OR NOT YEAH SO THERE'S A PRETTY TWO PARTS THAT QUESTION SENATE ROTH RIGHT ONE IS- PROCEDURAL IF WITH THE CITY WHICH YOU KNOW STARKLY WE'VE- HI. THANK AT LEAST FOUR FIVE TEARS NOW. ABOUT FOLLOW THAT PROCEURE IN TERMS OF GETTING THE MATERIAL TEACHER THE J. LACK MEMBER SO THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN A FIGHTER TO. ABBOTT SECONDLY I THINK WITHIN A ROTH IS ASKING ASSEMBLY WOMAN IS YOU KNOW REACHING OUT TO THE CITY THAT ARE AFFECTED POSSIBLY. AND MAYBE IF THAT CAN BE DONE MAYBE IN THE FUTURE AS OTHER PEOPLE ARE LISTENING TO THIS HEARING AS WELL. OTHER AUTHORS BABY MINDFUL OF AS WELL. SO I THINK THAT'S A WAY OF UNDERSTANDING IT AS WELL AND I KNOW WE HAVE A NUMBER OF FAIR ENOUGH LATEST YOU LET THE COMMITTEE. THAT NOT TO THE AFFECTED HM IN A- OUT OF. STATEMENT THAT YOU'RE MAKING TO MYSELF AND OUR COLLEAGUES AS WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THIS MOVING FORWARD. WITH THAT WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD THEN SENATOR GONZALEZ AND TO SEND HER MONEY. PLEASE MISTER WHAT THANK YOU- THROUGH THE TRAFFIC COUPLE QUESTIONS AND IT'S- TRYING TO UNDERSTAND- SOMETHING- TO YOU TALKED ABOUT. PERMITS. YOU TALK ABOUT CONTRACT. SO I'M UNCLEAR THE CONTRACTING PART OF THAT SO CAN. EXPLAIN TO ME. IS THE CITY CONTRACTING WITH CANNABIS BUSINESSES. OR YOU CONTRACTING WITH PEOPLE PROVIDING SERVICES THAT ARE AIMED AT HELPING CANNABIS BUSINESSES BECOME COMPLIANT WITH WITH THE CITY YEAH PERHAPS WE COULD HAVE THE CITY'S RESPOND PLEASE YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN PERMITTED DRESS THE MEMBERS CERTAINLY S. UP. MY READ OF THE LETTER IS NOT AS RICH TO CONTRACTING IS NOT RELATIVE TO CANNABIS ISSUES IS RELATED TO JUST GENERAL CONTRACTING PRACTICES OF THE CITY THAT'S MY READING THE LETTER. OUR STATE CANNABIS ELEMENT HOWEVER DOES ADDRESS HOW LICENSES ARE ISSUED AND THE DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTING ELEMENTS OF THAT NO TURN OVER MISS COMPETITIVE. I WANT TO WEAR A OF KIND. AS PART OF A CANNABIS- PERMITTING PROCESS SO I THAT'S THAT'S AND LOOK AND I SAT ON MY AYE AYE HELP RIGHT THE ORIGINAL THING- MEDICAL CANNABIS REGULATORY SAFETY ACT AND THERE'S A LOT OF. THE NEW LAWS ARE BASED ON THAT BUT I NEVER I CANNOT REMEMBER THE USE OF THE WORD CONTRACTING ANYTHING YOU HAVE THAT DOCUMENTATION AND I APOLOGIZE I THINK WHAT WHAT WE'RE DIRECTING IS BASED ON THE RESPONSE OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA'S LETTER. SHE HAS A LIST NINE QUESTIONS AND THERE'S TWO UMBRELLAS TO DIFFERENT TOPICS WHEN IS CANNABIS LICENSING PRACTICES. IN A SEPARATE PART IS THE CITY'S CONTRACT. UP UP PRACTICES SO WHERE THEY ARE I DID THE I IN THIRD THEY'RE RELATED WITH NOT THAT. BY CITIES CONTRACTING WITH KIND OF PROVIDERS A MESSAGE LIKE CLUB SO I'VE GOT A THING BUT I THINK THE CONTRA WITH INDIVIDUALS HELP CREATE THE STANDARDS FOR HOW THEY'RE GONNA BE AWARDING. LICENSES AND STUFF LIKE THAT SO THOSE THOSE CONTRACTS AT THE LAFAYETTE CONTRACTING PRACTICES BUT NOT DIRECTLY WITH THAT THIS MYTH THAT AND THAT WOULD BE MY UNDERSTAND SENATE THERE ARE BUSINESSES THAT. THEIR WORK WAS. WITH YOU KNOW HELP WITH. IN GUIDE FOR APPROPRIATE APPROPRIATE NOW FOR THE SO A COUPLE. I'M SET SIR OF SURPRISED QUITE FRANKLY THIS THAT HAVE A- ROUGHLY. CANNABIS PERMIT FOR LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED RESIDENTS IN THE CITY OF COMMERCE THAT SEEMS. LIKE A PRETTY HIGH NUMBER IF I'M READING YOUR POPULATION OF THIRTEEN THOUSAND AND TWENTY NINE LICENSES THAT. THAT'S A BIG NUMBER- ARE THESE- PERMITS MANUFACTURING EIGHTEEN OR THE DISTRIBUTION OR THE CULTIVATION OR THEY MEAN WHAT ARE THEY BECAUSE CERTAINLY IF YOU GOT TO NINE RETAIL ESTABLISHMENTS THERE YOU GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE GOING OUT OF BUSINESS TOMORROW. AND I TO BE ARE VERY SPECIFIC THE CITY OF COMMERCE DOES NOT HAVE ANY STOREFRONT DISPENSARY NONE OF THE BUSINESSES ARE OPENED TO THE PUBLIC EVERYTHING IS CULTIVATION MANUFACTURING DISTRIBUTION AND THERE IS A NON STOREFRONT DELIVERY. BUT ALL OF THE BUSINESSES ARE CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC OKAY ALL RIGHT THAT'S THAT'S HELPFUL ELSA. BUT IF I MAY- I'D LIKE TO ALSO MAKE ONE CLEAR FIND POINT- O CENTER ROTS QUESTION EARLIER ABOUT REASONS WHY NOT TO HAVE DECIDED I THINK I CAN PROVIDE WHEN AT LEAST ACTUALLY THINK THAT WE KIND OF DRESS THAT IT'S MY TURN TO HAVE CAUGHT. THE RIGHT ARE THIS IS ALSO ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION IS ONE THAT TERMS OF THE CITY BRING TARA JENS INSTANCE OF THE CITY FUNDING TO MARKET IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE CITY. HAS ONLY ISSUE THREE LICENSES PERMISSIBLE COLD A WE WILL WE WILL NOT ISSUE ANY MORE THAN ANY GIVEN TIME- THESE BUSINESS LICENSES WERE ISSUED BACK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE CITY AND ALL THE APPLICATION. SEND RISEN ONE YOU APPLICATIONS THE CITY'S CURRENT TRIGGERING THERE HASN'T SINCE TWENTY. SO IN TERM OF RELEVANT OF THIS TOP. I JUST FEEL HUNTINGTON IS BE POORLY. AND UNFAIRLY TARGETED BECAUSE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG CITY ATTORNEY US GIVE TURN CITY ATTORNEY UP I BELIEVE OUR- MUNICIPAL COURT WAS MODELED OFF THE STATE'S- MEDICAL MARIJUANA REGULATIONS. WELL ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE- YOU KNOW THAT THE STATE THE STATE. GRANTS LICENSES BASED ON ON ON A CITIES- PERMISSION TO OPERATE SO BUT WE DO NOT DICTATE HOW THE CITY ACTUALLY. GOVERNMENTS IT'S CANNABIS INDUSTRY AND WHAT I MEAN WE SET THE FLOOR NOT A CEILING SO YOU CAN BE A LOT MORE RESTRICTIVE AT THE CITY LEVEL THAN THAN WHAT WE WEEK WE-HAVE DONE AT THE STATE LEVEL AND WE'RE VERY RESTRICTIVE SO- SO I. I'M I'M STILL YOU KNOW I'M GONNA I'M I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE AUDIT TODAY BUT I I'M I'M- I'M JUST. STILL THERE'S PARTS OF THIS THAT MAKE ME UNCOMFORTABLE. I FRANKLY AND I THINK LOOKING AT THAT THANK YOU MISTER WOOD. OKAY WITH THAT LET'S GO TO MOVE TO SENATOR GONZALEZ. YES THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND YOU KNOW I SURE THE SAME SENTIMENT I KNOW WE SPOKE ASSEMBLY MEMBER I APPRECIATE YOU YOU KNOW REACHING OUT BUT IT WAS CERTAINLY AFTER THE FACT AND IT WAS SURPRISING TO ME OF COURSE THAT MY CITY WAS BEING AUDITED WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE SO PUT ME IN A POSITION- HERE I AM ON THE COMMITTEE AND CERTAINLY WILLING TO WORK AND I THINK THAT. I CAN'T SPEAK FOR COMMERCE BUT I CAN SPEAK FOR HUNTING PARK THERE CERTAINLY WILLING TO LEAVE THE AUDIT AND DO EVERYTHING THAT THEY NEED TO DO TO ASSURE THAT THEY'RE FOLLOWING BY STATE LAW AND GUIDELINES. YOU KNOW BUT THERE PROCESS AND SO I KNOW WE ARE AT NOW HAVE A FEW QUICK AND I KNOW UP AGAIN RESPECT INTO PARK I TO THE STATE- ALSO IF YOU KNOW JUST HAVE. A REAL TOUGH TIME WITH THIS. BECAUSE I GET IT THERE BEEN A YOU KNOW NEWS ARTICLES WE'VE SEEN YOU KNOW MANY THINGS ABOUT THE SOUTHEAST BUT UNFORTUNATELY- NOT RESPECTIVE TO JUST THESE TWO CITIES THOUGH. AND SO I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW WHEN WE HAVE A GOAL OF LOOKING AT THE REGION WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THE REGION AND I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO SIT DOWN. FIRST WITH ME THEM MANY OF THESE CITIES TO ENSURE THAT WERE CAPTURING ALL. KIND OF FEEL THAT THIS WAS YOU KNOW SORT OF AN ARBITRARY LIKE WE'RE GONNA JUST PICK AND CHOOSE WHO WE WANT TO. AT TO WHO WE WANT TO AUDIT THAT MAKES ME FEEL AN EASY. I'M BUT A QUESTION FOR THE AUDITOR IS THERE WAS A AN AUDIT THAT OCCURRED I THINK IT WAS IT DIDN'T GET COMPLETED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WITH THE CITY OF HUNTINGTON PARK. AND IT DID MENTION IT WAS A REGARDING FUTURE FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AND SORT OF A POTENTIAL HIGH RISK IT DID MENTION CONTRACTING I'M NOT SURE IF YOU. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT WS AT AND SO I WANT TO KNOW WHERE THAT WAS AT RELATIVE TO WHERE WE'RE AT NOW WITH THIS AUDIT RIGHT AND I MIGHT HAVE A MISTER TILDEN ASSIST ME WITH THIS. BUT WHAT WHAT THE CITY IS REFERRING TO WHEN YOU WERE REFERRING TO SENATOR IS WHEN WE WHEN WE CONDUCT THE ANALYSIS THE HIGH LEVEL ANALYSIS SAYS MR CHILDREN WAS REFERRING TO EARLIER. AND WE'RE LOOKING AT FISCAL INDICATORS- YEAH- AS FAR AS YOU KNOW ABILITY TO PAY THEIR BILLS AND SHORT TERM LONG TERM DO THEY HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDS IN RESERVE. AND OF THOSE INDICATORS APPEAR TO US TO SUGGEST THAT THE CITY IS UNDER FISCAL. CONSTRAINT THEN WE WILL GO OUT COCKED AN ASSESSMENT IT IS NOT AN AUDIT WE DO NOT A STATUTORY STODDARD AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT AN AUDIT. LOCAL HIGH RISK PROGRAM UNTIL THIS COMMITTEE APPROVES IT SO WHAT WE DID IS WE WENT OUT AND CONDUCT AN ASSESSMENT ESSENTIALLY WHAT AN ASSESSMENT IS GOING OUT MEET. IF IT PULLS IT DOING SO FOLKS LOOKING AT SOME DOCUMENTS BUT ONE. THING BUT IT WORKS WELL TEST CONTRA. WE'RE NOT TESTING EXPENDITURES THOSE ARE THINGS WERE JUST HAVING. BILLY AKON. OUGHT TO GET A FEEL FOR WHETHER OR NOT WE THINK THE CITY HAS. PLUS PLACE IF THERE IN IN OUR STRUGGLING WITH. ODD REVENUES OVER THERE EXPENDITURES ARE ARE TOO HIGH EACH YEAR- SO. ONCE WE COMPLETE THAT ASSESSMENT THEN WE HAVE TO MAKE A DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT SUFFICIENT CONCERN. TO COME TO THIS COMMITTEE AND ASK FOR AN AUDIT. IN THE CASE OF HUNTINGTON PARK WE DID THE ASSESSMENT. IT COMPARED TO OTHER CITIES THAT WE HAD LOOKED AT IT DIDN'T RISE TO THE LEVEL OF SOMETHING WE THOUGHT WE SHOULD COME TO THIS COMMITTEE. SO WE MAY HAVE LOOKED AT CONTRA I'M SORRY I DON'T HAVE ALL THE DETAILS- WE MAY HAVE TALKED TO THEM ABOUT THEIR CONTRACTING. DISS BUT WE CERTAINLY DIDN'T CONDUCT AUDIT WORK. IN ACTUALLY TEST CONTRA LOOKING OUT THERE PROCESS FOR REPORTING CONTRACTS. AND MONITORING CONTRACT BUT BASED ON THAT ASSESSMENT. THERE WASN'T ANYTHING OF SIGNIFICANT CONCERN TO US. THAT WOULD GENERATE AN AUDIT REQUESTS TO THIS COMMITTEE SO I HOPE THAT HELPS ANSWER YOUR- OKAY AND THEN I KNOW THAT- ASSEMBLY WOMAN YOU'D MENTIONED SOME ARTICLES BUT WAS THERE ANYTHING RECENT THAT WAS. STRIKING TO WARRANT THIS- PARTICULAR AUDIT REQUEST FOR THE CITY OF HUNTINGTON PARK I THINK THAT'S WERE LOOKING AS BUT AT A TRYING TO IDENTIFY BEST PRACTICES AND OF THE CITY FIFTEEN BEST PRACTICES THAT WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO'S BEEN DOING THIS IS SOMEONE THAT HAS. THE SLIGHT LONGER PROCESS THAN A CUP AND THAT WE COULD THEN SAY OKAY LET'S LOOK AT THIS AND DO THEY HAVE EXAMPLES OF THINGS THAT THEY DID OR YOU KNOW THAT MAKES SENSE ON AND WE CAN SAY WELL HERE'S A COUPLE OF THE WITH THE THING THAT MAKES THIS REBEKAH BEST PRACTICES. IN THOSE DAYS. THIS TIME WHO HAVE HAD A SOME LICENSES OUT THERE FOR WHILE- WITH THE LEGALIZATION OF IT IT'S THE YOU KNOW IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S GROWING RAPIDLY NOW ON THAT WITHIN HALF WE HAVEN'T HAD TOO MANY YEARS FOR. I THINK IT'S FOR ME MAKING SURE AS IS. EXPANDING IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY SINCE- WE STEP BACK TO THE EARLY BUT OTHER PEOPLE FACT. APPLIQUE OKAY. I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION HERE PLEASE SENATOR YES RIGHT I'LL I'LL HURRY IT UP OKAY SO ONE MORE THING I WOULD JUST SAY- I THINK THAT ANSWERED ALL OF MY QUESTIONS I SO I'M TEETERING BETWEEN TWO DIFFERENT THINGS BUT THE FIRST AT QUESTION I'LL ASK YOU IS WHETHER HE'D BE- YOU'D BE OKAY POSTPONING THIS UNTIL YOU SIT DOWN WITH THE LEASE. AND THEN WE CAN START A NOT AT THAT POINT. WELL I THINK I GUESS I DON'T- WHEN AUDIT STARTED ON SALE AT THE PASSES THE OUTER COAST I'M NOT SURE I MEAN I WOULD SAY THAT I WOULD. REQUEST THAT THE VOTE FOR THE LATTER TO STARE AT SOME POINT B. TAKEN TODAY WHEN KERR WORK ACTUALLY STARTS AND SO FORTH. I'M WILLING TO SAY THAT MAYBE SEE START OFFICIALLY A MONTH FROM NOW OR SOMETHING WHEN I OR WHATEVER I DON'T KNOW BUT I WOULD SAY THAT WE'RE NOT PLAN TO HAVE A MEETING FOR A COUPLE MONTHS AT LEAST. I AND- SO WHAT CAN MAYBE I CAN ADD SOME CLARITY HERE SO THERE'S TWO THINGS WE CAN DO WITH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE. THREE ONE IS. TO PUT. THE ENTIRE. AND OUR NECKS REGULAR SCHEDULED ONE WHICH WE'RE ANTICIPATING THE FIRST WEEK OF AUGUST. OR WE CAN DO IS APPROVE IT TODAY AND ASK THE AUDITOR IF SHE WOULD DELAY- THE AUDIT GOING INTO THE CITIES. SO WE'VE DONE THAT IN THE PAST AS WELL THERE'S PRECEDENT FOR THAT AS WELL SO THOSE ARE OPTIONS- BUT OF COURSE IS CONTINGENT UPON. THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN SINCE IT IS RIDE IT. AND BEYOND NEGOTIATIONS OR- DISCUSSIONS WITH THAT MEMBERS OF THE DICE. I MEAN I WOULD SAY WAITING UNTIL AUGUST. TROUBLING TO ME BUT- THE LATE IN. OF THAT THE CHAIRMAN HAS STATED TO SOMETHING I'M COMFORTABLE WITH. OKAY. ALL RIGHT- I WOULD LIKE TO THEN SAY- YOU KNOW IF WE WERE ABLE TO POSTPONE AND I WOULD PREFER THAT- TO WAIT TO OUR NEXT- MEETING JUST TO GIVE THIS THESE- TO CITIES TIME TO DISCUSS AND SIT DOWN WITH YOU- IF YOU'D BE WILLING TO DO THAT. WOULD BE MUCH APPRECIATED I'D BE WILLING TO SIT DOWN WITH YOU TO ENSURE THAT WE GET THIS RIGHT FOR THE SOUTHEAST REGION. AND ENSURE THAT THERE'S MORE CITIES THAT WE CAN INCLUDE IF THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AS WELL. I'M MY PREFERENCES THAT WE VOTE FOR A TWO DAY I THINK WAITING THAT MANY MONTHS FOR A VOTE AND THEN- IT MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE UP HAVING A VOTE THAT THIS WILL HAPPEN BUT ALLOWING THE AUDITOR TO DELAY HER WORK WOULD BE WHAT I'M MORE COMFORTABLE WITH- I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT EXTRA TIMES GOING TO SWITCH THE REQUEST- AND THE WORK THAT THE AUDITOR HAVE TO DO. CUT SO THEY GO FROM THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN SHE'S A- MORE COMFORTABLE WITH- THE AUDITOR DELAYING WHEN SHE ACTUALLY GOES INTO THE CITIES. BUT I THAT LET'S GO TO MOVE TO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS WILL COME BACK TO THIS BECAUSE SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING WE'RE GONNA NEED TO COME BACK TO. REMOVED OKAY. SENATOR ROBB MISTER MISTER CHAIR I'D PLEASE CENTER MINING IS WILLING TO LET ME JUST SUPPLEMENT MY- COMMENT. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M CLEAR ON THE RECORD ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES. TO ALLOWING RESPONDING ENTITIES TO BE PREPARED WHEN THEY COME IN HERE. IS WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING TO DEFINE THE SCOPE OF THE AUDIT. AND WHEN WE DON'T HAVE A FULL PLATE OF INFORMATION. THAT'S PRESENTED ONE WAY OR THE OTHER WHEN WE VOTE TO APPROVE AN AUDIT OR NOT. WE DON'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHAPE THE SCOPE OF AN ART. AND THAT'S PART OF THE REASON WHY I'M INTERESTED IN DUE PROCESS WHY I WANT PEOPLE TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE ADEQUATE NOTICE TO COME IN HERE WITH THEIR BRIEF CASE FULL OF MATERIAL. AND TRY TO CONVINCE US. EITHER TO NOT VOTE FOR THE AUDIT OR TO VOTE FOR THE AUDIT AND TO VOTE FOR A FOCUSED ON IT. OR RESHAPE DOTTED AND THAT'S MY POINT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU RESTAURANTS LET ME JUST ASK THE AUDITOR MAYBE THIS OP CLARIFY A LOT OF THINGS FOR A LOT OF FOLKS- MAN WATER YOU'RE- LOOKING AT THE SCOPE OF. MISS GARCIA'S LETTER DO YOU ANTICIPATE THAT EVEN CHANGING VERY MUCH EVEN IF WE ALLOWED ADDITIONAL TIME GIVEN THAT WE'RE ONLY LOOKING AT THE CONTRACTING IN CANNABIS LICENSING. I'D IN YOUR- HISTORY IN YOUR- EXPERIENCE HAVE YOU SEEN MUCH CHANGE. OVER THE COURSE OF A COUPLE MONTHS WELL AGAIN IT. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT IT'S A TO MEMBERS REQUESTS SO IF SHE WOULD HAVE TO BE CONVINCED BY THE CITIES. THAT THEY HAVE PROVIDED- APPROPRIATE MATERIALS TO HER AND HER STAFF. OUT TO CONVINCE HER THAT SHE DOESN'T FEEL THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A STATE AUDITOR ARE AN AUDIT OF APPROVED BY THIS COMMITTEE DIRECTING MY OFFICE TO GO IN AND- ASSESS THEIR CONTRACTING PRACTICES AND ASSESS THEIR PERMITTING PRACTICES- WE CERTAINLY. WE TYPICALLY DON'T ENGAGE WITH AN ENTITY ARE IF AN ORDER IS AN APPROVED WE ARE GOING TO HAVE PLENTY OF WORK FOR US TO DO FOR THE AUDITS THAT THE COMMITTEE. APPROVES TODAY NOW CERTAINLY WE WANT TO BE OF SERVICE TO MEMBERS SO IF MS GARCIA'S OFFICE ENGAGES WITH THE CITIES SHE RECEIVED MATERIALS SHE CERTAINLY COULD ASK US TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE END. BUT IT WON'T BE BASED ON AN AUDIT IT'LL BE JUST BASED ON IN A REASONABLE PERSON- BUT SHE AGAIN- I KNOW I'M I'M NOT BEING EXTREMELY HELPFUL HERE IT'S THE MEMBERS REQUEST AND I CERTAINLY WANT TO RESPECT THAT. IT'S HER DECISION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT SHE'S CONVINCED THAT WHAT THE CITY PROVIDES IS SUFFICIENT TO ANSWER HER QUESTIONS OKAY THANK YOU ATWATER ASSEMBLY WOMAN PLEASE I THINK FOR MYSELF AND FOR THE COMMUNITY HAVING THAT THEIR PARTY IN THE- LA ME. LEANING X. TO AT THIS DOCUMENT CENTER ON MY QUESTION THIRTY SAID THE DOCUMENT THAT I WANT TO SEE AT AGAIN THAT'S SOMETHING THAT AN INDEPENDENT AUDIT WOULD GET TO AND A MUCH BETTER CAPACITY THEM MYSELF. UNDER OKAY THAT WE HAVE A OF COURSE SO FROM THE DíAS WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO REMINDING THEM ASSEMBLY WOMAN RUBIO THAN CENTER BORDERS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. ON SO MY PREFERENCE WOULD BE THAT THE AUDIT REQUEST BE POSTPONED THAT THE- ASSEMBLYMEMBER MEET WITH THE CITIES AND ENGAGE WITH THE CITY'S WITH HER QUESTIONS AND IF NOT SATISFIED RETURN. TO REQUEST THE AUDIT FROM THIS COMMITTEE. MY CONCERN OF GRANTING THE ON IT TODAY AND THEN POSTPONING IT IS THAT THERE'S THE CITY WAS HER REYES TO POTENTIAL ADVERSE IMPACT IN TERMS OF A COMING BALLOT MEASURES- POTENTIAL MISINTERPRETATION OF HEADLINES ABOUT A STATE ON IT. THAT COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THOSE COMMUNITIES AND I JUST WANT TO ECHO THE CONCERNS RAISED BY BOTH SENATOR GONZALEZ AND SENATOR ROTH. THE WHOLE QUESTION OF DUE PROCESS I JUST THESE AUDITS KOSTELANETZ MY TAX ARE FOOTING THE BILL FOR IT AND I DON'T SEE WHY ANYONE WOULD REQUEST AN AUDIT BEFORE ASKING THE QUESTIONS TO THE ENTITY. THAT THEY WANT TO AUDIT IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THAT'S A LOGICAL FIRST STEP SO- I WILL BE NOT VOTING- FOR AN AUDIT TO BE. GENERATED TODAY I'LL BE GLAD TO WORK WITH THE PARTIES IN THE CHAIR ON IN TERMS OF TIME TABLE. ONCE THE COURTESY OF MEETING WITH THE CITY'S HAS BEEN AFFORDED THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR MOUNTING KIT ON BELIEVE THOSE QUESTION AND THAT WILL MOVE TO ASSEMBLY WOMAN REVIEW. THANK YOU- SO FOR ME- AND I UNDERSTAND THAT TIME ISSUE BECAUSE THIS COMMITTEE THE MEAT ON A MONTHLY BASIS LIKE MOST OF THE OTHER COMMITTEE SO I UNDERSTAND WHY WAITING TO AUGUST WOULD BE A DIFFICULT- I THINK WE CAN COME TO MIDDLE GROUND- TO ADDRESS THE POINT OF OUR MEETING WITH THE CITIES. TO QUITE HONEST I DON'T KNOW WHICH QUESTIONS TO ASK IF I WENT TO A CITY- AND OR WHEN I HAVE ACCESS TO DOCUMENTS THAT ARE PERHAPS ONLY THE AUDITOR HAS ACCESS TO SELL TO YOUR POINT I APPRECIATE THAT COMMENT HOWEVER IF I AM. YOU KNOW TRYING TO AUDIT WHEN MY CITIES WERE I DON'T KNOW WHICH DOCUMENTS I WOULD NEED- I CAN GIVE YOU WILL- EXAMPLES OF WHY I THINK I'M NOT SHOULD BE- CONDUCTED BUT I WOULDN'T KNOW WHICH DOCUMENTS I WOULD NEED SO IN TERMS OF MEETING WITH THE CITIES I BELIEVE THAT- IF WE APPROVE AN AUDIT AND POSTPONE IT I THINK THE CITIES WOULD HAVE AN- OPPORTUNITY TO. ADDRESS THE CONCERNS AND NOW HE ASSEMBLY WOMAN WOULD HAVE THE AUDITOR'S YEAR IF YOU WILL TO BE ABLE TO. GUY THAT AND WHY. YOU KNOW BUT- OUT. FORMS OF TARA. QUESTIONS DOES ASSEMBLY WOMAN COULD NOT THAT'S IN OPINION I'M AND AGAIN REASON FOR POSTPONING WOULD BE THAT- WE DON'T MEET ON A REGULAR BASIS WE MEET UNTIL AUGUST AND SO THAT'S THE TIME CONSTRAINT ISSUES SO I AM IN FAVOR OF. OUR VOTING FOR THE AUDITS OF BY POSTPONING IT SO TO GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO THIS FOR THE CITIES TO RESPOND AND AT LEAST THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN WILL HAVE- THE AUDITOR KIND OF AS A SOUNDING BOARD OR BECAUSE NOW THE AUDIT IS YOU KNOW BOB. APPROVED IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT- THE AUDITOR CAN DO PLEASE CLARIFY IF YOU CAN'T THEN BEEN MY WHOLE ARGUMENT IS OUT THE WINDOW. THE SHERMAN. LEASE SO IT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF DISCUSSION NEEDS TO HAPPEN ON THIS- FAIRLY QUICKLY BUT LET'S GO AHEAD AND I DIDN'T HEAR A QUESTION THERE SO LET'S GO TO. PLEASE ATWATER SO IF THE COMMITTEE APPROVES AND AGAIN THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS ALLEGE COUNSEL TO ADVISE ON COMMITTEE RULES BUT THE WHAT THE COMMITTEE APPROVES TODAY- WOULD BE THE SCOPE OF THE AUDIT THAT WE WOULD DO- IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT COMES TO OUR ATTENTION DURING THE COURSE OF THE AUDIT LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT THE PREVIOUS AUDIT ON ON TOXICS WHERE WE WOULD LOOK AT COST RECOVERY IF SOMETHING CAME TO OUR ATTENTION WE COULD EXPAND THE SCOPE OF THE AUDIT BUT WHAT WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DO IS. IF THIS AUDIT GETS APPROVED- PERHAPS IT'S DELAYED WE DON'T START UNTIL JUNE THIS WOULD BE THE SCOPE OF THE AUDIT NOW WE WOULD BENEFIT FROM IF THE CITY BELIEVES THEY HAVE A LOT OF ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS THAT WOULD REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT WOULD TAKE US TO CONDUCT THE AUDIT IT WOULD REDUCE THE COST OBVIOUSLY- BUT WE WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE ENGAGING WITH MS GARCIA- AS FAR AS OKAY THEY CITY HAS TOLD US THIS DO YOU HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THAT NOT HOW THE PROCESS WORKS ONCE THIS. THIS PROPOSAL THAT WE PUT TOGETHER ANALYSIS THAT WE PUT TOGETHER FOR THE COMMITTEE HAS APPROVED. THIS-BASICALLY DICTATES. THE WORK THAT WE WOULD DO WE CERTAINLY CAN DELAY COMMENCING THE AUDIT AND AGAIN. IF THE CITY'S RESPECTFULLY HAVE INFORMATION THAT THEY BELIEVE WOULD. CONVINCE US THAT ALL OF THESE PROCESSES ARE TERRIFIC THEN WE WHAT WE TYPICALLY DO WHEN WE CONDUCTED NOT IF WE GET INTO AN ENTITY AND WE SAY WE'RE GONNA TEST THIRTY ITEMS. AND WE TEST FIFTEEN WE FIND NO PROBLEMS IT'S LIKE WE'RE NOT GOING TO WASTE TIME TESTING ANOTHER FIFTEEN WE WANT TO KEEP THESE AUDITS AS COST EFFECTIVE AS POSSIBLE SO THAT'S THE APPROACH WE WOULD TAKE IN CONDUCTING THE ON IT TRYING TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF. A COST BECAUSE WE ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO YOU KNOW THE EXPENSE OF THESE AUDITS ON WE THINK THEY'RE VALUABLE OBVIOUSLY- BUT THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE AUDITS APPROVED THIS WOULD ESSENTIALLY BE THE SCOPE OF THE WORK. THAT WE WOULD DO. CUT. YEAH AND TYPICALLY WHAT WE DO IN COMMITTEE IS- WILL WE MAKE THE MOTION WE WOULD ASK FOR A DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STATE AUDITOR MOVING IN WHICH WILL. MOST LIKELY DO WITH ONE ANOTHER ITEM THAT'S ALREADY BEEN AGREED TO LATER ON IN OUR AGENDA. SO WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO CENTER BORE JUST REPLACE THANK CHAIRMAN WAS ANTICIPATING A COMMENTING ON THIS BUT THERE. WERE IN THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF ISSUES PUT FORWARD THAT I THINK. HAS CAUSED ME TO QUESTION. THE ROLE OF THIS BODY AND WHAT THE APPROPRIATE PROCESS SEES ARE. INTUITIVELY I WOULD THINK THAT AN AUDIT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE. WHEN AT A COUPLE THINGS HAVE ALREADY OCCURRED NAMELY THAT INFORMATION SAW IT HAS NOT BEEN PRODUCED. ANSWER QUESTIONS POSED HAVE NOT ALLOWED FOR- COMPETENT ANSWERS. OR A LAYER OF SURFACE- CERTAIN LAYERS OF SOPHISTICATION ARE REQUIRED ON THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE DOMAIN OF A GIVEN LEGISLATIVE OFFICE I THINK THAT'S ON THOSE ARE NOT ON FAIR I THINK. PRESUMPTIONS TO MAKE BEFORE IT ELEVATES TOOL FOR FULL FLEDGED USE OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO REVIEW SOMETHING IN IN DETAIL AND I COME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT ON BEFORE I- BEFORE I CAME TO THE SENATE. AND I THINK THAT THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE SAID ABOUT RESPECTING. IN GOING THROUGH A PROCESS OF A WIN- CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS REPRESENT AREAS THAT ARE GOING TO BE THE SUBJECT OF AN AUDIT ON. NOT JUST WITH THIS ISSUE I MEAN THERE'S ONE THAT'S GONNA BE COMING UP ON ITEM ONE OH TWO THAT WE WERE ONLY RECENTLY MADE AWARE OF ON THAT MY- THE AREA THAT I REPRESENT WILL BE THE SUBJECT OF AN AUDIT. I THINK WE HEARD FROM THE SENATOR A MOMENT AGO THAT SAID IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY HELPFUL TO HAVE GOTTEN A HEADS UP AND MAYBE QUESTIONS COULD HAVE BEEN POSED. PRIOR TO THAT IN ANSWERS GOTTEN- SO I THINK THE WRIST THERE'S A DUE PROCESS RESPECT FACTOR THAT I THINK IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD NOT BE OVERLOOKED. BUT ALSO GIVEN THE FACT THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO ELEVATE SOMETHING TO AN AUDIT IT SAYS THAT THE INDIVIDUAL REQUESTING IT OR THE OFFICE REQUESTING IT. WITH A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS REQUESTING IT THAT THEY PUT FORWARD THE DUE DILIGENCE TO GET ANSWERS TO THEIR QUESTIONS SPEAK WITH YOUR WITH ALL PARTIES IN THIS IS A CITY OR TWO. AND IF THEY CAN'T GET IT THEN IT BATES WORE THE LAYER OVER THE AMOUNT OF CITY CATION ON THE ISSUE REQUIRES THE INVOCATION OF ODD THE DEPARTMENT ON THOSE HERE SO WITH THAT BEING SAID. I'M SENSITIVE TO THE IDEA THAT- THERE MIGHT BE A TIMING ISSUE BUT BEAUSE IT THERE IS A DUE PROCESS THAT I THINK IS NOT BEEN FOLLOWED HERE JUST YET THE IDEA OF LAYING OUT. ON LIVE AGAIN SUMS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS SEEMS SLIGHTLY MATURE SO WHY WOULD I WOULD RESPECT TO WISH UP. ON THIS SPOKE EARLIER. MAYBE I COME BACK THE PROBE I'M IN ALL. IF THE DO YOU DILIGENCE THAT SHOULD PUT FOR INTO INTO PRO. DOES NOT YIELD A RESULT TO ME TO. THANK CENTER BORDERS LET'S GO TO BACK TO CENTER ROTH. YOU KNOW I OBVIOUSLY ALIGN MY COMMENTS WITH MY COLLEAGUES GOOD. WHO JUST SPOKE I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M CLEAR ON THIS AND UNFORTUNATELY ASSEMBLY MEMBER YOU HAPPEN TO BE IN MY- LINE OF SIGHT AND UNFORTUNATELY IT'S THIS PARTICULAR AUDIT- IT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE TO ME. THAT AN AUDIT REQUEST COMES IN HERE IMPACTING A LOCAL JURISDICTION. WHEN THE COLLEAGUES WHO REPRESENTS A JURISDICTION IS NOT MADE AWARE OF THE OTHER REQUEST ONE. TWO IT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE TO ME WHEN THE PEOPLE THAT ARE HAVING THE ENTITIES THAT ARE HAVING TO RESPOND TO THE OTHER REQUEST. GET ONE WEEK'S NOTICE. REGARDLESS OF WHAT WE FEEL ABOUT THE CONTENT OF THE REQUEST REGARDLESS OF HOW WE COME IN HERE. THINKING THAT WE'RE GONNA VOTE REGARDLESS OF WHAT WE THINK WE'RE GONNA VOTE AFTER WE HEAR THE INITIAL RESPONSE. I THINK IS A BODY WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO MAKE SURE THAT MEANT THAT. ENTITIES AND INDIVIDUALS WHO DID WHO DO NOT SERVE HERE. THINK THAT WE SERVE HERE AT. A PROPERLY AND THAT WE HAVE CORD PEOPLE WHO COME BEFORE US. THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF DUE PROCESS. DURING OUR DELIBERATIONS. HI WILL UNLESS THINGS CHANGE IN THE NEXT FEW MINUTES I WILL NOT BE VOTING- TO SUPPORT THE AUDIT TODAY. I WOULD SUPPORT A MOVE OF THE AUDIT TO THE NEXT. I THE REGULARLY SCHEDULED OR SPECIALLY SET. A MEETING OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE AND I'M IN FAVOR OF SPECIALLY SETTING AN AUDIT TO HEAR YOUR PARTICULAR REQUEST. AFTER WE GIVE THE INDIVIDUAL THE ENTITIES INVOLVED AN ADEQUATE AMOUNT OF TIME WHATEVER THAT ISTO BE DETERMINED BY YOU. TO COME IN HERE AND RESPOND TO THE OTHER REQUEST THE OUTCOME MAY VERY WELL BE THE SAME BUT IT'S THE OPTIC IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME. AND I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT I WASN'T CLEAR. THAT I WAS FUZZY IN MY COMMENTS BEFORE AND IT HAS I HAVE ABSOLUTE RESPECT FOR WHAT YOU DO AND FOR THIS OTHER REQUEST. I JUST THINK WE NEED TO DO A LITTLE BIT BETTER ON THIS ONE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU CENTER ROTH OKAY WITH THAT LET'S GO AHEAD AND- I DON'T KNOW IF I'D SIMPLY WOMAN YOU LIKED RESPOND IF THAT WILL GO TO MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT. ABOUT ALSO DOES THE SURPLUS AND ACTUALLY AND LEAVE WE'VE BEEN HERE FOR AWHILE I THINK WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE LEVEL OF SOPHISTICATION I MEAN I HAVE GONE ONLINE TO LOOK AT WITHOUT THEIR- AND BEEN TRACKING STUFF AND- IT'S GOTTEN TO THAT POINT OF LEVELS OF THE KIDS THAT THIS OCCASION WHERE IT'S BEYOND. MY ABILITY AND I THINK ALSO THE POINT OF WANTING TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT INDEPENDENT OF US RIGHT AND I COULD HAVE A- DIFFERENT PROFESSIONAL. LAND SO I WOULD SAY TO THAT TO THE- PROCESS TO THE AFFECTED AGENCIES I JUST ASSUME THAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD GIVE THEM. THROUGH THEIR PROCESS THAT WOULD HAPPEN AND- YOU KNOW WHAT THAT PROCESS IS A SOFTWARE THAT THE SEPARATE CONVERSATION- TO THE- TO MY CONVERSATIONS- AND WHAT I COULD HAVE SHOULD HAVE DONE. MISTER ROCK THANK YOU FOR YOUR- CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM OF THINGS THAT I SHOULD WORK ON. TIMES OUGHT WITH MY CITY OF COMMERCE WEEK I HAVE BEEN IN COMMUNICATION WITH COUNCIL MEMBERS AT DIFFERENT TIMES- AND IT'S FOR ME IS THAT THIS PROLIFERATION IS MOVING SO QUICKLY. THAT I HAVE CONCERNS AND I DO HAVE CONCERNS WAITING UNTIL AUGUST I'M NOT TO TRY TO GET TO CALL WHEN HEARINGS HAPPENED OF THEIR SPECIAL OR NOT WITH THAT. OKAY THANK YOU SOMEBODY WOMAN THAT THIS TIME LET'S GO AHEAD AND I. ASK THERE'S ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FROM THE DíAS HEARING. AND SEEING THAT LET'S GO TO MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM. THERE IS THERE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT HEARING AND SEEING. NON ALTERNATE BACK. TO MEMBERS OF THE DICE. SIMILAR AND WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I YOU KNOW I THINK. THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD THAT'S BEEN PROPOSED FOR IT TO BE BY SOME FOLKS I'VE I'VE HEARD VERY AND THINGS RIGHT TO VOTE Y SOME FOLKS TO APPROVE THE AUDIT BUT WAIT- DELAYED WHEN THE UTTER BEGAN TO WORK SOMETHING AND I'M OKAY WITH THAT I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE. MY PERSPECTIVE IN ME GETTING TO THAT POINT WORK THAT THEY'LL ALL WHY I'M I'M NOT PREPARED TO. ASK FOR THE LETTER TO BE ASKING FOR ANY MORE ON MAKING SURE THAT THESE ARE THE BEST PRACTICES IN GENERAL- AND SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR. AN EVO OF SOME VERSION OF THE TAP NEAR TODAY THAT A LOT OF A LOT OF USEFUL DISCUSSION THANK YOU SEVERAL WOMEN AND PERHAPS I CAN. OFFER SOMETHING THAT MAY BE MAY BE USEFUL IN THE SHORT TERM IN AROUND THAT WE HAVE HERE.

NUMBER ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER RIVAS I HAVE MISSED GARCIA FOR JOINING US THIS IS AGENDA ITEM NUMBER FIFTEEN TWENTY TWENTY DASH ONE ONE TWO ALMOST SERVICES COUNTY CONTINUUM OF CARE LEAD AGENCIES MYSTERY OF US WHEN YOU'RE READY TO BEGIN PLACE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AYE AYE IT'S STILL APPROPRIATE TO SAY- YOU KNOW GOOD MORNING I WAS AFRAID I WAS GONNA SAY GOOD AFTERNOON POSSIBLY GOOD EVENING BUT IN ANY CASE IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE ONE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COLLEAGUES IN HIS AS WE ALL KNOW. HOMELESSNESS IS A STATE WIDE CRISIS THAT IS IMPACTING EVERY REGION OF CALIFORNIA AND OVER TIME THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVE ALLOCATED- MILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN EFFORTS TO FIGHT SYSTEMIC AND TO EQUIP LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH THE TOOLS OR THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO CREATE SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS TO REDUCE OUR HOMELESS POPULATION- AND AS WE ALL KNOW BASED ON THE DAILY NEWS ARTICLES WE READ THE PEOPLE WE TALKED TO LOCAL LEADERS ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE NEIGHBORS I AM FROM THE OBSERVATIONS WE CAN MAKE WHETHER IT'S- WHILE IN THE CAR DRIVING A WALL GOING ON A WALK THESE OBSERVATIONS BACK. HOME OR DISTRICTS OR RIGHT HERE IN OUR STATE CAPITOL IN SACRAMENTO. THAT THIS HOMELESS. THIS HOMELESSNESS ISSUE HAS EXPLODED. AND IT HAS EXPLODED IN ALL PARTS OF CALIFORNIA I CLEARLY THE SITUATION THIS CRISIS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO GET MUCH MUCH WORSE WORSE BECAUSE MORE AND MORE CALIFORNIANS. FACE HOUSING IN SECURITY EACH AND EVERY DAY- AND IN RESPONSE OUR STATE HAS INCREASED ITS ROLE IN PROVIDING HOMELESSNESS FUNDING- AND IT IS CLEAR THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDS WILL CONTINUE TO BE ALLOCATED TO ADDRESS THIS CRITICAL ISSUE AND AS THE GOVERNOR SAID THE LAST WEEK IN THE STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS THE ROAD AHEAD IS DIFFICULT. BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE- AND WE AND WE MUST DO ALL WE CAN TO SOLVE THIS CRISIS. AND WHILE WE WRAP UP FUNDING OR AT LEAST WHAT WE CONSIDER IT AND WE DEBATED IN THE COMING WEEKS AND MONTHS IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE ALSO RAMP UP OUR ANALYSIS OF EXISTING PROGRAMS- TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE BOOSTING- THE EFFORTS THAT HAVE SHOWN THE MOST PROMISE- AND SO- I'M HERE. THIS MORNING ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLYWOMAN GARCIA- AND WE ARE CALLING FOR STATE AUDITOR TO ANALYZE A CONTINUUM OF CARE EFFORT. BECAUSE THESE LOCAL AND REGIONAL AGENCIES ARE ANY CENTRAL TOOL- AND ESSENTIAL TOOL FOR THE STATE TO HELP OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. THE CONTINUUM OF CARE IS AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM OF CARE- THAT GUIDES AND TRACKS HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES TO HELP ORGANIZE AND PROVIDE SERVICES TO MEET THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS. N. AS THEY MOVE OR TRANSITION TO STABLE LIVING ENVIRONMENTS ANOTHER SOLUTION TO ANY HOMELESSNESS ISN'T ONLY ABOUT INCREASING THE HOUSING SUPPLY OR THE NUMBER OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS- IT'S ALSO ABOUT FOCUSING ON THE VERY NEEDS OF A SPECIFIC POPULATION. SUCH AS OUTREACH EMERGENCY SHELTERS RAPID RE HOUSING MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORTS TRANSITIONAL HOUSING AND PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING- AND IF WE ARE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW WE AS A STATE CAN BEST SOLVE OUR HOMELESSNESS CRIED. WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE TOOLS ALLIES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO HELP IDENTIFY THE BEST AND MOST EFFECTIVE PRACTICES. I IN ALTHOUGH EVERY COUNTY EVERY REGION'S UNIQUE AND DIFFERENT. THE LEAD THE CONTINUUM OF CARE AGENCIES THEY- WILL PROVIDE OR MAY PROVIDE UNEXPECTED OPPORTUNITIES FOR OTHER CO SEASON OUR STATE OTHER AGENCIES TO STRATEGICALLY IMPROVE THE USE OF CURRENT AND ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AGAIN FOR THE PURPOSE OF EFFECTIVELY ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS AND SUPPORTING PEOPLE IN OUR STATE AND IN CLEARLY CURRENTLY THERE ARE GAPS IN TO EMPHASIZE. THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO BE AWARE OF AFFECTED STRATEGIES TO CONDUCT ACCURATE ANNUAL COUNTS ACCURATE COUNT OF THOSE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS- IN COORDINATION WITH OTHER HOMELESS SERVICE AGENCIES AND FINDING A PATHWAY- A PATHWAY THE STRATEGY THAT WORKS YOU KNOW HAVING AN ACCURATE COUNT OF A HOMELESS POPULATION IS CRITICAL IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE SURE THAT WE GET. THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF FUNDING AVAILABLE AT THE AND LEVEL- AND MOST IMPORTANTLY- TO GIVE US THE ABILITY TO EFFICIENTLY TARGET OR FOCUS- SUCH RESOURCES AND DOLLARS- TO THE PROBLEM- AND SO CERTAINLY THE STATE CAN IDENTIFY AND PROVIDE INCENTIVES TO THE CONTINUUM OF CARE AGENCIES TO WORK ALONGSIDE NON PROFITS AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS TO SECURE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- AND AS A STATE WE SHOULD STRIVE. TO LOCATE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS OR REGIONS THAT HAVE INSUFFICIENT OR IN SOME CASES NO SERVICES- AND FIND THE REASONS WHY THOSE AREAS HAVE INADEQUATE RESOURCES AND WE SHOULD BE READY TO REACH OUT TO UNDER FUNDED REGION'S FOLLOWING THE RESULTS OF THIS AUDIT. TO BE APPROVED QUICKLY SUPPLY OUR COMMUNITIES WITH THE NEST WITH THE RESOURCES TO SOLVE THERE YOU CALL SUCH SHINS I AM WILL BALLOT EN WILL CONTINUE OKAY THEN THIS SOURCE SOLVE THIS CRISIS THIS BUSINESS HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. THIS FUNDING WON'T FULLY OUR GOAL IF UNDER WHAT PRO ARE WERE THAT IS BY THE OP ED IS. OTHER MORE I DAY BUT JUST A HAPPY ON CONTINUE OF EIGHT ON THEIR WORK BUT WE TAX REASON WE THE THEY ARE IT'S A- ON AND THAT THEY A AGENCIES AND FIVE CAN. A RIDGE. THAT INCLUDE SOUTHERN. THE CENTRAL COAST THE BAY AREA THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY AND SO WITH THAT I. WILL HANDED OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE- SOME THE WOMAN GARCIA PLACE NOT THINK I WANT TO THANK MR RIVAS FOR HIS THOROUGH COMMON SO KEEP MINE SHORT. I REPRESENT NINE SMALL CITIES WITHIN IN THE COUNTY OF LA AND WE'VE SEEN OUR POPULATION GROW RAPIDLY LIKE IN MOST OTHER PLACES ACROSS THE STATE WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD ONE OF THE- FASTEST RATES OF INCREASE- AND LA COUNTY. AND THE REGION THAT I AM AND SO AS WE ARE SPEND THIS MONEY I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE NOT ONLY HAVE THE BEST PRACTICES SOMEWHERE AWARE OF- WERE WERE WHAT IS AND ISN'T WORKING. BUT WHILE ALSO MAKING SURE THAT CITIES LIKE MINE ARE NOT OVERSHADOWED BY LARGE CITIES. AND THAT RESEARCHERS ARE BEING DISTRIBUTED EQUITABLY ACROSS COUNTIES AND THE STATE AND SO I DO ALSO APPRECIATE THAT FOCUS TO THE AUDIT AND SO I ALSO RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOUR THE SIMS GO TO MOVED THE OTHERS PRESENTATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS AND GARCIA INDICATED WE WOULD LOOK AT FIVE COUNTIES. IN THE REGIONS THAT MR RIVAS MENTIONED- AND STARTING IN LOOKING AT PLANNING. THESE CONTINUUM OF CARE OF CO SEES ALL REFER TO THEM AS WHAT THEY'RE PLANNING IS THEIR STRATEGIES FOR ADMINISTERING SERVICES TO THOSE. IN THEIR RESPECTIVE COUNTIES WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ARE THEIR BEST PRACTICES THAT COULD BE SHARED AMONG THE THIS CO SEASON PERHAPS OTHER CO SEASON THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ALSO LOOKING AT AS HE MENTIONED IN HIS COMMENTS MR RIVAS. OUR WATER THE CEO SEES DOING TO CONDUCT WHAT STRATEGIES ARE THEY USING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE CONDUCTING COUNTS. OUT THAT RESULT IN AN ACCURATE COUNT OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS- IN THEIR RESPECTIVE COUNTIES. IN ADDITION DETERMINING THE RESOURCES AND WHAT PROTOCOLS THE CEO SEES USED TO MEASURE HOW EFFECTIVE THE PROGRAMS THAT NON PROFITS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. ARE PROVIDING TO A HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS. IN ADDITION LOOKING AT COLLECTING RETAINING AND ANALYZING DATA NOT JUST WITH RESPECT TO HOMELESSNESS BUT ALSO WITH RESPECT TO SERVICES THAT ARE BEING PROVIDED TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS. SKEWS ME- AND VERIFY WHETHER TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH CEO SEES ACTUALLY COLLABORATE AND COOPERATE WITH. NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS ARE WITH RESPECT TO AGAIN AS MR RIVAS INDICATED OUT REACH. OUT REACHING OUT TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE HOMELESS AND- TALKING TO THEM ABOUT OUR ARRAY OF SERVICES THAT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO THEM. I'M ALSO LOOKING AT OPPORTUNITIES AND INCENTIVES THAT PERHAPS STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE CEO SEES WORKING COLLABORATIVELY. OUR COULD SECURE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING YOU MAY RECALL WE ISSUED AN AUDIT A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WHERE WE LOOKED AT HOMELESSNESS WE WERE WERE SPECIFICALLY ASKED TO LOOK AT LA COUNTY. WE EXPANDED THE SCOPE UP BY DOING SOME WORK TO SEE. THE IMPACT ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ONE OF THE RESULTS IN THAT AUDIT WAS WE WERE NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF FEDERAL MONEY LIKE OTHER STATES WERE SO THIS OBJECTIVE WOULD WOULD GET AT THAT WHAT ARE THE CEO SEES DOING TO. WORK COLLABORATIVELY TO TRY TO MAXIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF FEDERAL MONEY THAT COMES INTO CALIFORNIA FOR THIS PURPOSE. A COUPLE OF OTHER OBJECTIVES DETERMINE WHETHER STRUCTURAL CHANGES OR RESOURCES ARE NEEDED. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CEO SEES IN THE COMMUNITIES- HAVE ACCURATE DATA ALL THE WAY THROUGH VARIOUS PROCESSES- AND CERTAINLY DURING THE EVALUATION OF SERVICE PROVIDERS THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE CORRECT ACCURATE DATA WHEN THEY'RE EVALUATING. SERVICES THAT ARE BEING PROVIDED AND THEN THE LAST COUPLE OF OBJECTIVES AS FAR AS WHAT ARE THE CEO SEES DOING TO TRY TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SERVICE PROVIDERS WITHIN THEIR RESPECTIVE COMMUNITIES- FIRST IDENTIFYING HOW MANY THERE ARE OUT THERE IF THERE ARE SERVICE PROVIDERS WHO HAVE NOT.

AFTERNOON ON THE DOCTOR. SINCE THE PASSAGE OF PRISON ALIGNMENT LEGISLATION IN TWENTY ELEVEN CALIFORNIA HAS SENT MORE THAN EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS TO COUNTIES TO COVER THE COST OF MOVING INCARCERATED PEOPLE FROM PRISONS TO JAILS. THIS STATE HAS MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND TEN. LONG TERM JAIL FACILITIES AND DEPARTMENTS ARE NOW RESPONSIBLE FOR POPULATIONS THAT ARE LARGER AND FAR MORE DIVERSE. CONDITIONS SUCH AS OVERCROWDING POOR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT AND MISMANAGEMENT OF FUNDS BY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS HAVE BECOME FAR TOO FREQUENT READS IN ARTICLES IN THE NEWSPAPERS AND ALSO FAR TOO FREQUENT IN JAILS ACROSS THE STATE. AND WE KNOW THAT THE EFFICIENT RESPONSIBLE SPENDING OF PRISON REALIGNMENT FUNDS IS INCREDIBLY CRITICAL. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CONTINUE TO MOVE PRISON REALIGNMENT FUNDS FROM ONE LAW ENFORCEMENT PURPOSE TO ANOTHER WITH LIMITED STATE OVERSIGHT. TODAY I'M HERE TO REQUEST THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SUCH OVERSIGHT PARTICULARLY OVER LOS ANGELES COUNTY ALAMEDA COUNTY AND FRESNO COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS. I ALONG WITH MANY ADVOCATES ARE CONCERNED ABOUT BUDGET BATTLES COUNTY LEVEL REFUSALS TO CONDUCT AN AUDIT AND DEATHS WITHIN FACILITIES RESPECTIVELY THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY JAIL SYSTEM IT'S THE LARGEST SYSTEM IN THE WORLD. HAS ITS FAIR SHARE OF TROUBLES IN OCTOBER TWENTY NINETEEN THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO IMPROVE TO APPROVE A PARTIAL FREEZE OF A HUNDRED FORTY THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OF THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT'S BUDGET. OVER SPEND UNDER THE CURRENT SHERIFF IS MORE THAN FOUR TIMES THAT OF HIS PREDECESSOR. ALAMEDA COUNTY IS JAIL POPULATION HAS DECREASED BY HALF SINCE PRISON ALIGNMENT TOOK EFFECT YET EVEN WITH THE POPULATION DECREASED THE ALAMEDA COUNTY SHERIFF'S HAS EXPERIENCED A BUDGET GROWTH BY A HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. IN THE PAST FOUR YEARS IN THE PAST TEN YEARS MY BAD TOTALING FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS AND TWENTY NINETEEN. FORTY FIVE INCARCERATED PEOPLE DIED WHILE HELD AT ALAMEDA COUNTIES SANTA. RITA JAIL IN THE FIVE YEARS BETWEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN IT'S THE HIGHEST DEATH RATE IN THE BAY AREA. THE FRESNO COUNTY JAIL WHICH HOUSES MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND INMATES HAS SEEN THE SHARPEST INCREASE OF DEATHS OF ANY CALIFORNIA JAIL SINCE THE PASSAGE OF REALIGNMENT LEGISLATION. FRESNO COUNTY LARGER JAIL SYSTEMS THE CALIFORNIA DOJ HAS REPORTED TWENTY THREE DEATHS IN THE SEVEN YEARS PRECEDING PRISON REALIGNMENT. THAT FIGURE HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED SINCE REALIGNMENT AT FORTY SEVEN DEATHS IN ONLY ONE OF THOSE DEATHS WAS CAUSED BY A FELLOW INCARCERATED PERSON. CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE LEADING STATES IN PROGRESS OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM YET THERE IS LITTLE OR NO ACCOUNTABILITY FOR COUNTY SHERIFF'S TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE SPENDING REALIGNMENT FUNDS AS INTENDED. THE VASTLY DIFFERENT WAYS THAT THREE OUT FOR MENTION COUNTIES HAVE SPENT THEIR FUNDS ATTEST TO THIS FACT. MY HOPE IS THAT THIS AUDIT OF THREE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS WILL OPEN THE DOOR TO AUDITING OTHER SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE MUST WORK TO SUPPORT THE DIGNITY AND HEALTH OF INCARCERATED CALIFORNIANS IN ACCESS TO DATA THAT IS FULL AND TRANSPARENT IS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO CRAFT LEGISLATIVE SOLUTIONS SO HERE IN SUPPORT I HAVE MARC ANTHONY CLAYTON JOHNSON OF JUSTICE LA. AS WELL AS EVETTE OUTLAY OF DIGNITY AND POWER NOW AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I. BUT- HI THANK YOU ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY. A GOOD AFTERNOON- MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS DISCUSSION AND THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER COMMA FOR BRINGING THIS TO THE LIGHT JUST SO LAYS A COALITION OF COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ADVOCATES AND FOLKS ARE IMPACTED BY INCARCERATION OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY- AND WE COME TO THIS CONVERSATION REALLY WITH HOLLY PLEASE IF YOU WE COULD HAVE YOUR NAME AS WELL FOR THE RECORD I'M SORRY MARC ANTHONY CLAYTON JOHNSON. WE COME TO THIS CONVERSATION WITH THE HOPE TO GROUND US AND THE IMPETUS BEHIND AB ONE OH NINE WHICH WAS THE BROWN VERSUS PLOT THAT CASE- WHAT'S- AB ONE ANNISE OFTEN TALKED ABOUT. AS A STRATEGY TO REDUCE INCARCERATION- REDUCE OVERCROWDING REDUCE RECIDIVISM. AND WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT THAT CASE WAS ALSO ABOUT MEDICAL NEGLIGENCE AND ABUSE. ON THAT. AMOUNTED TO A CONDITIONS- THAT WORD NAME THIS CRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT AS DEFINED BY THE FOURTH AMENDMENT. AND SO THE FUNDAMENTAL CONTRADICTION WE HAVE TO ASK AN ADDRESS IS HOW WE HAVE MOVED RESOURCES. ON FROM THE PRISON SYSTEM TO THE LOCAL JAIL SYSTEMS- PARTICULARLY IN PLACES LIKE LAST SENTENCE WHICH HAVE FAILED ON THE SAME PREMISE IN FACT THE DOJ IS OPEN UP INVESTIGATIONS- INTO THE LESS IT IS COUNTY JAIL SYSTEM FOR THAT VERY. REASON ARE CRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT AROUND THE ISSUES OF HEALTH CARE ON THE ISSUES OF OVER CUTTING ON AROUND ISSUES OF ABUSE. AND IN IN FACT. THIS LAST YEAR WE'VE SEEN- THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS BUDGETS GO UP WITH RESPECT TO AB ONE OH NINE ALLOCATION SPECIFICALLY ALLOCATIONS LOS ANGELES HAVE GONE TO THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT IS TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND FRESNO SEEN. AGAIN 53% GOING TO CUSTODY ALLOCATION THAT SO WE ARE ALL SET TO ASK OURSELVES. HOW WE ALLOCATING THESE FUNDS. TO ENTITIES ATTACKS DON'T HAVE. A INTEREST DIVERTED. OUT OF THE- THAT THAT MOVES. THOSE PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR WRIST. AND IN THE UPPER. OF A OTHER DEPARTMENTS SUCH AS THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES- AND THEREFORE WEAKENING THE JUSTIFICATION. FOR THAT MONEY IN THEIR BUDGETS I THINK ONE THING IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO NOTE. THAT THESE ISSUES OF- CRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT IN OUR JAIL SYSTEM CONTINUE TO- CONTINUE TO HAPPEN- SUCH AS THE H. THE- OCCURRENCE OF THE DEATH OF ONE GLORIA HE WAS A YOUNG MAN DON'T LÏNG LATINO MEN AND LOSS AND JUST COUNTY JAIL. WHO HAD A MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION WAS PEPPER SPRAY TO DEATH BY THE LOS ANGELES SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. HE IS ONE OF EIGHT PEOPLE HAVE DIED LAST YEAR LOSS CENTERS COUNTY JAIL SYSTEM- WHEN WE HAVE OTHER METHODS OTHER MECHANISMS OF THE STRATEGIES THAT ARE MORE EFFECTIVE IN WE HAVE WAVE THEM. AGAIN TO THE PATTERN OF AB ONE OH NINE ALLOCATIONS AS LAID OUT. WE HAVE THE BENEFIT OF THE PUBLIC DEBATE THAT HAPPENED ON AUGUST THIRTEENTH IN THE COUNTY. OF LOS ANGELES WHERE THE COUNTY ELIMINATED AND DECIDED TO CANCEL A CONTRACT OF FOUR BILLION. FOUR BILLION DOLLARS TO APPROVE A MENTAL HEALTH- JAIL SYSTEM. AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE OFFICE OF DIVERSION AND RE ENTRY IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY HAS A- NON RECIDIVISM RATE OF NINETY ONE PERCENT- AT SIX MONTHS AND EIGHTY FOUR PERCENT. AT TWELVE MONTHS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE MENTAL HEALTH- SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH DISABILITIES VIOLENT CHARGES AND SUBSTANCE USE WHILE THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. HAS A RECIDIVISM RATE OF 60% AND LASTLY I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO ALSO LOOK AT THE BIGGER PICTURE. WHERE THE LAR IN THE LARGEST COUNTY IN LAW IT LARGEST COUNTY IN THE COUNTRY. PARMA MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT HEALTH SERVICES THE OFFICE OF DIVERSION REENTRY AND THE PART IN A PUBLIC HEALTH COLLECTIVELY RECEIVE SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. THAT IS 17% OF AB ONE ON NINE ALLOCATIONS AND 20% OF THE SHARES ALLOCATION OF TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE BEST POISED TO. FACILITATE MORE EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS. THANK YOU IN THE INTEREST OF TIME FOR COULD BE VERY CONCISE BECAUSE WE MVED TO THE STATE AUDITOR'S PRESENTATION. PLEASE KEEP THE FAST MY NAME IS THE BALLET I AM THE SENIOR POLICY LEAD FOR DIGNITY EMPOWER NOW. A MEMBER OF THE JUSTICE LA COALITION FOR NEARLY A DECADE OUR MEMBERS HAVE CALLED FOR THE EVALUATION OF AB ONE OR NINE SPENDING IN OUR COUNTY. AND REINVEST AND COMMUNITY BASED ALTERNATIVES TO INCARCERATION. I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF OUR COALITION IN STRONG SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER COME AUGUST REQUEST FOR AN AUDIT OF LA COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AB ONE OR NINE SPENDING. BUT WE ALSO ASK THAT THE AUDIT EXTEND TO ALL THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES RECEIVING AB ONE OR NINE ALLOCATIONS. INCLUDING THE LA COUNTY PROBATION OFFICE SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN LA COUNTY HAS RECEIVED OVER A BILLION IN AB ONE OH NINE FUNDING INTENDED FOR ALTERNATIVES TO INCARCERATION. BUT SO FAR AB ONE OH NINE HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO FULFILL ITS PURPOSE OF REDUCING RECIDIVISM AND JAIL POPULATIONS BECAUSE THE FUNDING HAS NOT REACHED. COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS WEBER DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ON REENTRY NEEDS. THE MAJORITY OF AB ONE OH NINE FUNDING HAS GONE TO THE COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND PROBATION OFFICE. TO PERPETUATE THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF JAIL INCARCERATION IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. IN FISCAL YEAR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THROUGH TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THESE DEPARTMENTS RECEIPT OVER SEVENTY SEVEN PERCENT. OF AB ONE ON I'M FUNDING AND SAID OF USING THESE FUNDS TO FULFILL THE INTENT OF AB ONE OH NINE THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT HAS CHOSEN TO USE A LARGE PORTION OF THE- FUNDS. TO PAY FOR STOP OVER TIME. THE RETURN ON YOUR INVESTMENT HAS BEEN A RECIDIVISM RATE OF 60% OF OVER OUT. BY CONTRAST THE OFFICE OF DIVERSION RE ENTRY RECEIVED YOUR 5% AND I COLLEAGUES MARK AT THE NO. AT THE 84% RICH. RATE DOLLAR FOR. INVEST. RECEIVE A THOROUGH AUDIT OF ITS AB ONE OR NINE SPENDING. THANK YOU IT WAS GOING TO MOVE TO THE STATE AUDITOR'S PRESENTATION PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER COM LONGER INDICATED WE WOULD GO TO THREE DIFFERENT COUNTIES ALAMEDA FRESNO LA- AND SHE'S ASKED US TO LOOK AT A FEW ISSUES HERE AND I'LL GO A RELATIVELY QUICKLY. FIRST ASKING US TO LOOK AT A TEN YEAR WINDOW- WITH RESPECT TO POPULATION- AND THAT WILL ALLOW US TO LOOK AT POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS PRIOR TO REALIGNMENT AND AFTER REALIGNMENT AND- AND SHE'S ASKED US OVER THAT TEN YEAR WINDOW TO LOOK AT TRENDS. ARE AND CERTAINLY TRY TO LOOK AT SOME DEMOGRAPHICS WITH RESPECT TO RACE RACE AND ETHNIC MAKE UP AND CERTAINLY ON THE NUMBER OF INMATE DEATHS. IN ADDITION ARE ASKING US TO LOOK AT FUNDING THAT IS GOING TO EACH OF THESE COUNTIES. AND THE AMOUNT THAT IS GOING TO SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT'S BUT WE ALSO IN HAPPEN THE OBJECTIVE ANY OTHER RELEVANT DEPARTMENT SO THAT WOULD ON ALL LIKELIHOOD PICK UP THE PROBATION DEPARTMENTS. IN THESE THREE COUNTIES ALSO LOOKING AT WHAT THE COUNTIES ARE PROJECTING AS FAR AS FUTURE REALIGNMENT FUNDING THAT THEY WILL RECEIVE. THEN ON THE FLIP SIDE LOOKING AT EXPENDITURES AND THE CATEGORIES OF EXPENDITURES FIRST OF ALL. ARE THE ARE THE COUNTIES OUT SPENDING ALL THE FUNDS THEY'RE RECEIVING BURST. A SECOND IT IT IN THAT FOR THE EXPENDITURES WHAT MAJOR CATEGORIES ENFORCEMENT TREATMENT- AN OPERATION SO HOW MUCH ARE THEY SPENDING ON ENFORCEMENT VERSUS TREATMENT OF THE AT THE INDIVIDUALS AND IN THEIR RESPECTIVE JAILS. AND FOR OPERATIONS. AND THEN WHETHER OR NOT THESE EXPENDITURES THAT WE LOOK AT OUR ACTUALLY CONSISTENT WITH REALIGNMENT REQUIREMENTS. AND THEN THE FINAL TWO OBJECTIVES EVALUATING AGAIN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ARE AT EACH OF THE RESPECTIVE OF FACILITIES ARE THREE RESPECTIVE COUNTIES. ARE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEIR BEST PRACTICES IN OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE NOT ONLY ACCOUNTABILITY OF THEIR FINANCES AND REALIGNMENT FUNDS BUT TRANSPARENCY OF THAT. OVERSIGHT OF THE USE OF THOSE FUNDS AND THEN FINALLY- TRYING TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF REALIGNMENT ON EACH JAILS POPULATION. NOT JAIL STAFF BUT ENFORCEMENT AND POTENTIALLY LOOKING AT WHAT'S OCCURRING IN THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES- THE BUDGET FOR THIS AUDIT ABOUT TWENTY SIX A LITTLE OVER TWENTY SIX HUNDRED HOURS. THAT WOULD TAKE US A LITTLE OVER SIX MONTHS TO COMPLETE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU MADAM AUDITOR OKAY AT THIS TIME IS GOING TO MOVE TO THE AFFECTED AGENCIES THIRTY AFFECTED AGENCIES I WISH TO SPEAK ON THIS AGENDA ITEM. PLEASE JOIN US UP HERE. YOU CAN BEGIN BY ANNOUNCING A YOUR NAME AND WHICH CITY OR WITH OKAY I'M NOT SURE OF GREG AARON ALAMEDA COUNTY SHERIFF THANK YOU ON A COUPLE THINGS- REGARDS TO THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE- OKAY. CAN I HAVE ONE PERSON ALLOW THE ADDITIONAL. FOR SOME TESTS. PLEASE FUNDS FOR A AB ONE OH NINE OR- CONTROLLED BY THE PROBATION OFFICERS IN EACH COUNTY AND THERE ALLOCATED TO. OF THE DIFFERENT ENTITIES BASED ON APPROVAL FROM THE A- COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS PARTNERSHIP OF SO THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE SIMPLY REQUEST THE FUNDS AND IN OUR CASE OF. A 50% OF MONEY GOES OUT TO COMMITTEE BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO HELP FACILITATE OF THE INMATES AND RE ENTRY WHILE THE FUNDS THAT ASSURES OFFIC ALAMEDA COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICERS ARE A DIRECT PAYMENT FOR THE NUMBER OF DAYS AND MAJOR SPENT IN CUSTODY CHARGED AT AN AVERAGE DAILY RATE. AND SO- WE BILL BASICALLY FOR EACH DAY THAT WE HAVE THE PEOPLE IN CUSTODY ARE RELATED TO AB ONE NINE. A NEXT SOME OF THE NUMBERS THAT- WERE- DEDICATED TO OTHERS BODY A SHOWED THAT THE WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR A FORTY FIVE THAT'S WHEN IN FACT WE BELIEVE THAT NUMBER TO BE THIRTY NINE TO US AND WE- UNDERSTAND THAT ONE DEATH IS TOO MANY. AND WE MONITOR OF THOSE WE HAVE A OVERSIGHT- ALREADY IN PLACE- THE DEALS WITH OUR- MEDICAL PROGRAM OR MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM AND ARE OF. ISSUES REGARDING THE DEATHS THAT OCCUR IN INSIDETHE FACILITY AND I'D BE WILLING TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT- YOU MIGHT HAVE THANK YOU PLEASE ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY. PLEASE ANNOUNCE YOURSELF US WELL FOR THE RECORD MARGARET MEN SHARE FOR FRESNO COUNTY I DID. REALIGNMENT WAS ESTABLISHED AS- PREVIOUSLY OUTLINED. AND THE REALIGNMENT MANY THAT CAME TO COUNTIES WAS TO OFFSET THE IMPACTS OF THAT REALIGNMENT. IN THE IMPACTS WERE GREAT FOR INSTANCE 50% OF THE PAROLE SUPERVISION CASES NOW ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENT THE WAY THE FUNDS GET ALLOCATED AND THE OVERSIGHT IS THROUGH OUR COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS PARTNERSHIP. A SEVEN MEMBER A COMMITTEE THAT MAKES A DECISION ON HOW THE FUNDING IS ALLOCATED DEPENDING ON THE PRESENTATIONS THAT ARE PROVIDED BEFORE THAT COMMITTEE. SO AS A SHERIFF'S OFFICE AND ANYBODY THAT WANTS TO TALK ABOUT NEEDING CCP MONEY HOW WE MAKE THAT PRESENTATION THE COMMITTEE OF SEVEN MEMBERS THAN VOTES. AFTER WE VOTE ON HOW ARE BUDGET WILL GO FOR THE YEAR AT THE IT'S NOT OVER THAT'S NOT THE FINAL APPROVAL GOES ON TO OUR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WHO THEN APPROVED THE BUDGET OR CAN DENY. AT THE BUDGET THAT IS PRESENTED. SO AT AND ALSO RECENTLY WE'VE WE'VE HAD AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL AUDIT OF OUR C. C. P. IN THE WE ARE FUNDS ARE REALIGNMENT FUNDS ARE SPENT- BROWN ARMSTRONG DID THE AUDIT. THERE WERE NO FINDINGS NOTE NO EXCEPTIONS A WE SPEND FROM A REALIGNMENT. I AM AT HAD ANY OF THESE QUESTIONS BEEN ASKED OF ME BEFOREHAND I WOULD I WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE ANSWERED THESE QUESTIONS. ABOUT WE HAVE RECENTLY HAD AN AUDIT THE FUNDING DOES HAVE OVERSIGHT WITH R. C. C. P. OUR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. AT AN OUT ALL INTERNET QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. THANK YOU SHERIFF- AT THIS TIME LET ME ASK IF. I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL AGENCIES AND THE ROOMS THAT ARE AFFECTED. HEARING IN SAYING THAT LET ME TURN IT BACK TO MEMBERS ON THE DíAS FOR QUESTIONS ON A SOUTHERN BORDER JUST IF YOU LIKE. TO BEGIN PLEASE THANK YOU CHAIRMAN OF WE HAD A VERY INTERESTINGAND I THINK CONSTRUCTIVE- CONVERSATION ON. SOMETHING ANALOGOUS TO WHAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING HERE- WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THIS BODYAND WERE RISE TO THE LEVEL- SUBJECT MATTER WISE AND PROCESS WAS- DESERVING- AN AUDIT. ESPECIALLY ONE THAT RAISES THE LEVEL OF THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH IS NOT CHUMP CHANGE. I LOOKED AT A JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE SHEET HERE. AND IT KIND OF CONFIRMED INTUITIVELY I THINK WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE. WHAT THE PROCESS IS FOR SOMEONE ORDERS IN ORGANIZATION TO ELEVATE. A MATTER TO YOU- PURPOSES OF A OF AN AUDIT. AND I THINK THIS IS THE INFORMATION SHEET THAT EVERYONE FILLS OUT WHEN THEY- OF PUT FORWARD. A REQUEST. IT HAS- IT'S CALLED THE INFORMATION SHEET FROM JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE THE REASON I BRING IT UP IS THAT ON- NUMBER SIX SEVEN. THE QUESTION IS EXPLAINED THE STEPS YOU'VE TAKEN TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OR TOPIC OF THE AUDIT. AND THE FIRST QUESTION IS HAVE YOU REQUESTED THE AGENCY TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION YOU SEEK TO OBTAIN. IN THE AUDIT. SO I JUST LEARNED OF THIS AUDIT. RECENTLY AND I THINK OF FRESNO LEARNED OF IT NINETEEN THROUGH THE TWENTIETH LAST WEDNESDAY LAST WEDNESDAY ART SO WE KNOW OF ANOTHER SITUATION WHERE WE'RE WE'RE JUST FINDING OUT ABOUT IT. ADEQUATE PREPARATION MAY NOT HAVE ALLOWED FOR A GIVEN THE TIME CONSIDERATIONS. BUT THE SHERIFF MENTION A COUPLE THINGS I THINK ARE REALLY APPROPRIATE AND IMPORTANT FOR US TO APPRECIATE. THAT THERE WAS IT IN AUDIT OF FRESNO COUNTY BY A FIRM CALLED BROWN AND ARMSTRONG THAT- HAD FINDINGS RELEVANT TO THE AREAS IN OF THE SCOPE OF THIS PROPOSED INQUIRY- WINDED- THE REQUESTING PARTY. GET A COPY OF THAT BROWN ARMSTRONG. ARM AUDIT TO MY KNOWLEDGE IT WAS NEVER REQUESTED ALL RIGHT. THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE FOR THE BOARD OF SUPERVISOR- PROCESS THAT WENT THROUGH IN TERMS OF APPROPRIATING DOLLARS THAT DEAL WITH- ALL THE ISSUES THAT ARE BEING BROUGHT UP TODAY DID- AND AT THAT INFORMATION GET A QUICK REQUESTED AS WELL NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE. ART SO I THINK WE HAVE A SITUATION HERE AGAIN WHERE. WE JUST FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS AUDIT. AND SOME OF THE MOST PRESSING IN CLEAR CUT OPPORTUNITIES TO PROVIDE INFORMATION WERE NOT PURSUED. AND IT'S EVEN NAME EVEN IN OUR OWN COMMITTEE PROCESS SO MY RECOMMENDATION IS THAT THE REQUESTING PARTY. DO THE DUE DILIGENCE GET THE INFORMATION FROM THESE THREE COUNTIES ARE TWO OF THE LEADERS ARE ALREADY HERE IS THAT A REASONABLE REQUEST I WOULD I THINK SO UNDER THE MICE YOU KNOW FOR MY STANDPOINT. AS WE WERE ASKING FOR THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TWENTY SIX HUNDRED WORK HOURS WORTH TWENTY TWO HUNDRED HOURS WORTH OF INVESTMENT. BINDING ON THE AUDIT DEPARTMENT I THINK IT NEEDS TO RISE TO A LEVEL THAT EITHER. YOU'VE DONE THE DUE DILIGENCE AND NOT GOTTEN THE INFORMATION YOU WANTED OR THE LEVEL OF SOPHISTICATION IS JUST TOO MUCH WHEN YOU NEED A THIRD PARTY TO INVOLVE THEMSELVES. BUT I THINK HAVING NOT DONE THAT. I THINK THAT THIS IS EARLY PREMATURE MIGHT IN MY OPINION AND RESPECTFULLY WOULD ASK MAYBE THE MAKER OF THIS- THIS AUDIT REQUEST WOULD IT GO BACK TO THOSE THREE COUNTIES GET THAT INFORMATION AND THEN IF THE IF YOU DON'T LIKE WHAT YOU GET PORTS INCOMPLETE. THEN BRING BACK THIS AUDIT REQUEST AND I THINK THAT WOULD MAKE IT A BILL YOU RIGHT REQUEST AT THAT TIME. TWENTY ASSEMBLY WOMAN IF YOU'D LIKE TO RESPOND WELL YES THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR- THE COMMENTS AND MAYBE- SOME OF THE ADVOCATES CAN ALSO RESPOND WE KNOW THAT REQUESTS AUDIT REQUESTS WERE ASKED- FOR ALAMEDA COUNTY AND OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY IN THOSE ON ITS HAVE NOT HAPPENED AND THAT'S BEEN. AS CONTENTIOUS CONVERSATION THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING IN BOTH OF THOSE COUNTIES RESPECTIVELY WE ALSO KNOW THAT NONE OF THESE COUNTIES HAVE THERE SEE C. PAP CURRENCY CPSC PLANS WHICH TALK ABOUT THE SPENDING. ON THE B. SEC WEBSITE AND THIS IS A WEBSITE WHERE YOU CAN GO TO GET INFORMATION ON HOW THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS ARE SPENDING IN ALLOCATING THE MONIES AND WE HAVE HAD.NO UPDATED PLANS SENSE IN SOME INSTANCES TWENTY ELEVEN OR TWENTY FOURTEEN IT DOES SAY THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE TO REVISE IT BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT IF THEY ARE MAKING CHANGES AND HOW THEY'RE SPENDING THE REALIGNMENT FUNDS. THAT WE AS A STATE AND AS COUNTIES HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY AN OBLIGATION TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THAT INFORMATION. I WOULD JUST ADD LEASE. I WOULD JUST ADD TO THIS CONVERSATION I THINK IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE CERTAINLY. HAD A NUMEROUS. ATTEMPTS BAR COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO ACTUALLY GET INFORMATION FROM THE COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT CLOTHING- INFORMATION ON THE CAUSES DEATHS THAT HAPPEN INSIDE THE COUNTY JAILS INCLUDING INFORMATION ABOUT WHY. THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS REQUESTING THREE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS- FOR ITS BUDGET DESPITE THE FREEZE THAT HAS HAPPENED AND DESPITE A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY AROUND HOW THESE. FUNDS ARE SPENT AND SO THERE IS CERTAINLY A TRACK RECORD IN WHICH WE COULD PROVIDE YOU- A LIST OF SOME OF THOSE MOTIONS AND OUTCOMES OF SOME THOSE MOTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN UNSATISFACTORY TO THE COUNTY AND CERTAINLY TO US. AS WHO FOLKS OF LOVE ONCE INSIDE. THANK YOU IF ALL QUESTIONS ARE BORDERS ARE PRECISELY I THINK- AND- I THINK WE'VE HEARD FROM SOME FOLKS THAT THERE MIGHT BE INSTANCES WHERE THINGS HAVE NOT BEEN PRODUCED AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN OR COULD HAVE BEEN PRODUCED AND WARRANT WE HAVE A GLARING SITUATION HERE AT LEAST ONE POSSIBLY TWO COUNTIES. ARE WHERE REQUEST HAD NOT EVEN BEEN MADE. LIKE I DON'T WANT TO PREJUDGE SITUATION BUT- I WOULD MAKE ONE FINAL RESPECTFUL REQUEST. BRING THIS MATTER BACK IN AT IF YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO GET. WE HAVE OUT FRESNO ONE ALAMEDA- I WOULD JUST RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOU CONSIDER IT I HEAR YOU I ALSO KNOW THAT THEIR OF BEEN CONVERSATIONS OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS LEVEL AT ALAMEDA COUNTY WORK COMMUNITY HAS REQUESTED AUDIENCE. AND THEY HAVEN'T RECEIVED THEM AND SO WE HAVE ONCE AGAIN AND TALKING TO ADVOCATES AND PEOPLE IN THE VARIOUS COUNTIES AND LOOKING AT THE NUMBER OF SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THE STATE. AND WHAT'S BEING DONE WITH REALIGNMENT OR WHAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S BEING DONE WITH REALIGNMENT DOLLARS YOU KNOW WE'VE- LOOKED AT SOME OF THE CAR FEW OF THE DEPARTMENTS WHERE EITHER MOST EGREGIOUS ACTIVITIES. HAVE BEEN TAKING PLACE OR WHERE THERE'S JUST A HIGH DEGREE OF OPAQUE MATH. THANK YOU WITH THAT WE'RE GONNA BE GOING TO MOVE TO SENATOR ROTH. LET ME JUST A OFFICE MY COMMENTS BY SAYING HOW MUCH RESPECT I HAVE FOR THE REQUESTER AND THE SPECTACULAR JOB THAT SHE DOES- IN THE ASSEMBLY AND CERTAINLY WITH THIS REQUEST FRANKLY I. REVIEWED MY- BINDER- OVER THE pPREPARED TO OF. VOTE TO APPROVE THIS REQUEST BUT I HAVE TO JOIN. IN THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE ONCE AGAIN A- I'M BOTHERED BY THE FACT THAT IT'S A. ENTITIES THAT ARE BEING AUDITED DON'T GET SUFFICIENT. ADVANCE NOTICE OF THE FACT OF THE AUDIT REQUEST IN THE DETAILS SURROUNDING IT TO COME TO THIS HEARING THAT WE HAVE PREPARED TO ADDRESS THE REQUEST. PROVIDE INFORMATION THAT MIGHT ENABLE US TO- BUT JUST THE SCOPE OF THE AUDIT WERE APPROPRIATE. ANNA I THINK THAT MAY. REFLECT A STRUCTURAL DEFECT THEY WE HAVE PERHAPS IN OUR PROCESS IF WE HAVE AUDIT REQUESTS AND IF RESPONDING ENTITIES COME HERE WITH SO WEEKS NOTICE FOR FIVE DAYS THREE DAYS NOTICE OR WHATEVER THE NOTICE PERIOD IS. IT MAY VERY WELL BE THAT WE VOTE TO APPROVE THE AUDIT ANYWAY AND I CERTAINLY THINK THAT. IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA THERE PROBABLY NEEDS TO BE A NOT IT SOMEWHERE SOMEHOW. BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE'RE BEING ASKED TO PROVIDE IT'S WHERE THE RESPONDING ENTITIES DON'T REALLY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME IN HERE WITH THEIR- PLATE OF INFORMATION THAT ENABLES US TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION ON THE- THE WAY THE AUDIT IS FRAMED THE SCOPE OF THE IT SO. HAVING SAID I DON'T HAVE A QUESTION I'M JUST NAY ACUTE JOINING IN THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE. IT IT CAUSES ME TO BE UNCOMFORTABLE. AS A MEMBER OF A JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE APPROVING THE EXPENDITURE OF NOT IN SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF MONEY APPROVING ANY IN ESSENCE THE SCOPE OF AN AUDITING THAT IS FRAMED BY THE REQUEST. HOWEVER WELL RESPECTED BY ME AND OTHERS AND HOWEVER WILL ROUTE- RESPECTED BY MY COLLEAGUES. AND JOINED IN BY THE AUDITOR WHEN WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO DECIDE WHETHER THAT'S THE SCOPE OF THE AUDIT THAT SHOULD BE APPROVED OR NOT PERHAPS. AND I DON'T KNOW HOW WE DEAL WITH THAT. MAYBE I COULD SHED SOME LIGHT ON THIS RIGHT JUST BECAUSE HISTORICALLY SPEAKING- WE'VE ALLOWED THE REQUEST YOUR ONE TO TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE HEARING TO ACTUALLY ADJUST THE SCOPE BASED OFF THEIR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ENTITIES INVOLVED. I SEEMS TO ME THAT TODAY'S HEARING THERE SEEMS TO BE TWO DIFFERENT. THINGS GOING ON ONE IS THE ACTUAL NOTIFICATION WHICH WE'VE GIVEN DEFERENCE TO EACH OTHER OUR COLLEAGUES TO CHANGE THE SCOPE WITHIN ONE TO TWO WEEKS BEFORE AND SECONDLY WHETHER THE REQUESTED ARE ACTUALLY REACHING OUT TO THE IT TO THE ENTITIES INVOLVED WHEN THEY'RE EXPLORING THE IDEA. OF A POSSIBLE I REQUEST AND IT'S AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT- THE LATTER IS THAT SEEMS LIKE WERE REQUESTING OF OUR COLLEAGUES IS IF THEY COULD AT LEAST GIVE A- HEADS UP OR HAVE A DISCUSSION WITH THE MEMBER ONE WHOSE JURISDICTION THAT A FAX. AND SECONDLY- PERHAPS EVEN CONTACTING SOME THE AGENCIES PRIOR TO SUBMITTING A REQUEST TO THE ATTIC BUT- READ. MISTER CHAIR IF I MAY BE IF I MAY JUST. FURTHER MY COMMENT THEN I GUESS THE QUESTION I HAVE IS WHAT IS OUR ROLE ARE WE SIMPLY A RUBBER STAMP WHEN SOMEONE COMES IN AND PRESENTS AN AUDIT SCOPE OR DO WE HAVE AS A AS A AS A COMMITTEE THE AUTHORITY TO ADJUST. THE SCOPE OF THE OTHER BASED ON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IF WE'RE SIMPLY RUBBER STAMP THEN I CAN SET UP STAIRS EAT MY LUNCH SINCE WE ALL GET ON IT IN RIGHT CORRECT NO- MAYBE WE NEED TO WOULD HAVE FOR THE YEAH THE CLARIFICATION THEN WOULD BE YOU KNOW AS WE ALLOW OUR COLLEAGUES THE WHAT THE- THE ONE TO TWO WEEKS AS ARE ADJUSTING THEIR SCOPE IS TO WORK WITH COMMITTEE STAFF. IN ADJUSTING THAT SCOPE WHERE APPROPRIATE AND SO- NOT A RUBBER STAMP BUT REALLY ACTUALLY TRYING TO BE INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS AS WELL HELPING THE MEMBERS I DETERMINE THE SCOPE OF THEIR AUDIT AS A BRING THAT BEFORE THE SLUDGE THAT APPLY. AND IF I MAY ADD THEN SAM YOU KNOW WE SOME FINALIZED- ADJUSTED THE SCOPE OF THIS AUDITOR'S REQUEST IN CONSULTATION WITH THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE SO IT WASN'T AS IF THIS OFFICE JUST DECIDED TO ASK A BUNCH OF RANDOM QUESTIONS. WITHOUT SEEKING ANY GUIDANCE FROM THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE WE ALSO KNOW THAT THIS IS A CONTENTIOUS ISSUE QUITE FRANKLY YOU KNOW IN A COUPLE OF THESE COUNTIES AT LEAST AND WE HAVE SEEN AND HEARD OF THE STRUGGLES THAT THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ARE FACING WHEN TRYING TO ACCESS A LOT OF THIS INFORMATION AND SO OFTEN TIMES. IT'S NOT ABOUT RUBBER STAMPING BUT IT'S ABOUT PROVIDING THE WEIGHT. AND THE OVERSIGHT FROM THE STATE TO SAY YOU KNOW THESE ARE OUR DOLLARS THAT WE THEN PASSED ON TO YOU AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS REALIGNMENT OR THIS INVESTMENT IS BEING USED ACCORDING TO THE WISHES OF THE NEEDS OF THE TAXPAYERS. AND LASTLY I THINK AS WE ALL WOULD HOPE I CERTAINLY DO I HOPE THAT WHATEVER TRANSPIRES WITH THE AUDITS ARE DONE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT I GOT YOU BUT IN FACT THIS IS A THIRD ASK TO SAY HOW ARE THESE DOLLARS BEING USED BECAUSE WE CERTAINLY CAN'T SEE THEM ON THE WEBSITE. SO ARE THEY BEING USED WELL ARE THEY YOU BEING USED AND IF NOT WHAT ARE SOME COMMENDATIONS THAT YOU ARE AND- TO MAKE SURE THAT THE- DOLLARS. WELL SPENT AT THE END OF THE DAY I THINK I WAS TAXPAYERS THAT'S WHAT WE WANT WE WANT TO KNOW THAT WE ARE GETTING A STRONG RETURN ON INVESTMENT. WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MENTAL AND THE PHYSICAL HEALTH IN THE CONDITIONS OF THOSE THAT ARE BOTH INCARCERATED IN WORKING IN THOSE FACILITIES. ARE BEING TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT BUT WE CERTAINLY. GIVEN THE FACT THAT REALIGNMENT HAPPENED WANT TO KNOW THAT THAT'S- THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH OUR DOLLARS IS WHAT WE SAID WE WANTED TO HAVE DONE. AND ONCE AGAIN. YOU KNOW. THEY'RE THE ARM OF THE STATE. CAN BE VERY USEFUL AND HELPING TO GUIDE THAT KIND OF. RESEARCH WELL I THINK THE ME JUST MISTER CHAIR IS ME JUST LIKE A FINAL COMMENT. SO MRI THANK YOU YOU AND YOUR AUDIT REQUEST JUST GOT CAUGHT UP IN A LARGER CONVERSATION. IT REALLY HAS NOTHING TO DO FRANKLY WITH THE NATURE OF THE REQUEST. FOR OR THE VALIDITY OF THE REQUEST OR PROBABLY THE NEED FOR YOU GOT IT THIS JUST HAPPENS TO BE THE SECOND TIME WE'VE HAD RESPONDING ENTITIES COME. AND SAY THEY FOR HAD VIRTUALLY NO NOTICE OF REQUEST- AND THEN WE'RE BEING ASKED TO DO WHAT I DON'T KNOW. SO MY COMMENTS REALLY YOU ARE- SIGNAL TO THE PEOPLE THAT RUN THIS SHOP- WHEREVER THEY ARE THAT MAYBE WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS AT THE STRUCTURAL. A MECHANISM BY WHICH WE PROCESS AUDIT REQUESTS AND THE NOTICE THAT WE GIVE TO THE PEOPLE TO COME BEFORE US BECAUSE IF WE WERE. ON THE RECEIVING END. WE WOULD PROBABLY WANT TO BE TREATED A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY WOMAN FOR YOUR RESPONSE THAT WAS GOOD AND. EURO YOUR NEXT. WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON THEN ASSEMBLY WOMAN RUBIO BUT LET ME REMIND THAT THE COMMITTEE THAT WERE ALSO BOUND BY THE RULES- BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES AND SO THIS IS SET OUT IN THE RULES IF WE'D LIKE TO CHANGE THAT MORE THAN HAPPY TO DISCUSS THE CHANGES AS WE MOVE FORWARD BUT THIS IS OUTLINED IN THE RULES BETWEEN THE JOINT HOUSES- FOR HOW THIS COMMITTEE OPERATES SO WITH THAT LET'S GO TO MOVE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON THEM TO ASSEMBLY WOMAN REVIEW. HELLO THINGS HERE THAT UP ARE I THINK. ABSOLUTELY STRIKING. WE HAVE- THE SHARE FOR FRESNO COUNTY SITTING HERE SAYING THAT THEY HAD NO NOTICE. NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO THAT THEY HAVE DOCUMENTATION. WITH RESPECT THERE IS AN OVERSIGHT PROCESS THAT HAS BEEN. UP ARTICULATED AND THAT A THAT WELL REGARDED DEEPLY RESPECTED AUDITING. FIRM HAS IN FACT AUDITED. THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. HOW THIS BODY COULD CONTINUE TO PUSH AN AUDIT FOR A PARTICULARLY FRESNO COUNTY AT THIS MOMENT WITH THIS INFORMATION ON RESOLVED AND NOT A PART OF THEIR DUE DILIGENCE ON THEIR DELIBERATIONS. HONESTLY STRIKES ME FAR MORE MEDICAL THEN A REAL EFFORT AT GETTING AT THE TRUTH. IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN GETTING AT THE TRUTH WE HAVE INFORMATION THAT CAN GET YOU THERE AND IT'S BEEN PUBLICLY NOTED THAT FOR THE RECORD I WANT TO JUST ALSO SAY I'M I'M NEW TO THE COMMITTEE. AND MY EXPERIENCE WITH THIS COMMITTEE FIRST OF ALL WAS WITH A REQUEST FOR AN AUDIT OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL. IT TOOK PROBABLY. TWO YEARS THREE YEARS AGO APPROVED WE ARE UTILIZED A GREAT DEAL OF HELP FROM A BIPARTISAN GROUP OF LEGISLATORS. AND IT DID COME TO THIS BODY THAT'S THE KIND OF PROCESS THAT I THINK WE HAVE TO. AND HERE TO IN ORDER TO BE ABSOLUTELY FAIR THAT THOSE AGENCIES THAT ARE BEING REQUIRE ARE REQUESTED TO BE AUDITED. HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF ENGAGING. WAY PRIOR TO A NOTIFICATION OR WAY PRACTICE AS HAVING TO SIT THROUGH THIS. AND I REALLY AM. RIGHT CONCERNED THAT SENSE I SAT ON THIS COMMITTEE I HAVE HAD THIS. REALLY SERIOUS UNDER CURRENT OF DREAD THAT THIS BODY IS ALLOWING ITSELF TO BE POLITICIZED AND I WANT TO WARN AGAINST THAT THE CREDIBILITY OF THIS GROUP IS AT STAKE I AM NOT SUGGESTING THAT WE DON'T DO ANYTHING. WHAT I'M SUGGESTING IS THERE IS NO NECESSITY TO RUSH INTO THIS PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE PUBLIC TESTIMONY OF AT LEAST ONE AGENCY THAT HAS LEGITIMATE CLEAR INFORMATION READY AT HAND AND READY TO IT AT THAT TO PREPARE TO BE. TO BE PUT FORWARD SO- I I'M I'M GOING TO HAVE TO VOTE NO ON THIS- BUT I DO THINK THAT IT IS A APPROPRIATE WARNING THAT OTHERS HAVE BEEN GIVEN HERE. THAT WE HAVE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE AGENCIES THAT ARE COMING UNDER THE PURVIEW OF IT A LOT OF REQUEST. BE GIVEN A DUE PROCESS OPPORTUNITY OF ENOUGH TIME TO FULLY BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO THE UNDERLYING QUESTIONS. MOST OF THE A QUESTIONS COULD VERY WELL BE ANSWERED WITHOUT OF THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND. DOLLARS WORTH OF INQUIRY IF WE WOULD JUST. SLOW DOWN TAKE A DEEP BREATH. AND ASK THE INFORMATION GIVE PEOPLE PLENTY OF TIME AND THEN GO FORWARD. THE DRESS PATTERSON REMOVED TO ASSEMBLY WOMAN RUBIO THANK YOU AND THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER FOR OUR YOUR REQUEST- I THINK BEING FROM LA COUNTY- I THINK THAT- WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A COUPLE DIFFERENT THINGS THE PROCESS ABSOLUTELY HAS TO BE LOOKED AT HOWEVER IN MY OPINION. IF I AN AGENCY WITH WHOEVER MAY BE EVEN IN MY OFFICE IF SOMEBODY IS DOING THEIR JOB- AND THE QUESTION IS ASKED YOU PULL OUT AND I'M WITH A FILE AND PROVIDE THE INFORMATION SOLD THE ARGUMENT THAT THERE IS NOT ENOUGH TIME TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION. LEADS ME TO THINK THAT THERE OUGHT THEIR PROCESSES ARE NOT NECESSARILY- FLOWING PROPERLY BECAUSE IF YOU NEED MORE THAN THAN YOU KNOW A WEEK'S TIME TO PROVIDE PRODUCE THAT INFORMATION THEN. WHERE WHO IS WORKING ON THAT INFORMATION NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO THIS IS MY FAVORITE COMMITTEE BECAUSE WE GET TO LOOK AT- DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND DIFFERENT- PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO IN THIS CASE WE HAVE MULTIPLE AGENCIES THERE ARE BEING AUDITED SO IF YOU GUYS ARE DOING A GREAT JOB I WOULD LOVE TO TAKE WHAT YOU'RE DOING. AND PUT IN AN ALLEY COUNTY AS A MODEL OF HOW LA COUNTY SHOULD RUN THIS PARTICULAR- ITEM SOUL IN IN AUDITING YOUR YOUR SPECIFIC AGENCIES AND IF YOU ARE DOING A GREAT JOB I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THAT INFORMATION SO THAT WE CAN GO TO LA COUNTY AND SAY LOOK AT THE GREAT JOB THAT THESE TWO AGENCIES ARE DOING. CAN WE MODEL AFTER THAT AND THE STATE AUDITOR'S. JOB IS NOT A GOTCHA BUT STATE EITHER JET AUDITOR'S JOB IN MY OPINION IS TO- PRODUCE BEST PRACTICES FOR WHATEVER AGENCY THAT WE AUDITING AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO HOW OTHER PROPHECIES CAN BE BETTER AND WHAT BETTER WAY TO DO THAT THAN TO SEE. OTHER AGENCIES THAT ARE DOING WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSE TO BE DOING ANY AND IN LA COUNTY TAKE YOU OF THE MODEL SO THAT WE CAN SAY HATE THEY'RE DOING A GREAT GREAT JOB LEADS DO WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND THE OTHER- I GUESS ISSUE IS THAT. WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT MONEY- THE PUBLIC DOES NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO AUDIT ANYBODY ANY OF OUR THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND THE AGENCIES HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET THAT INFORMATION ON THE WEBSITE. THEN THE NORMAL PUBLIC HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET THAT INFORMATION ON THE WEBSITE AND IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MONEY THAT WE PROVIDE IS BEING ACCOUNTED FOR AND IN THIS CASE. AGAIN IF THAT INFORMATION IS NOT PROVIDED WHY IS IT NOT PROVIDED DO THEY NEED A YEAR TO FIX THAT. YOU KNOW SHOULD WE GAVE THEM GIVE THEM A YEAR. IN ADVANCE I HEADS UP THAT WE'RE GOING TO I DID THEM SO THAT THEY NOW THEY PUT IT ON THE WEBSITE THAT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY IS TO PROVIDE ACCURATE INFORMATION. AND IF THEY'RE NOT DOING IT THE MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY THAT WE DO TO AUDIT THESE AGENCIES. SO IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE TAXPAYER AND BEST INTEREST OF OUR MONEY I. THINK THAT WE SHOULD ADDED THESE PROGRAMS AND AGAIN TO THE AGENCIES AFFECTED. YOU KNOW WE WANT TO TAKE YOUR BEST PRACTICES INPUT IN LA COUNTY BECAUSE GUESS WHAT WE HAVE ISSUES AN ALLEY COUNTY IS VERY WELL KNOWN. AND IF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HAVE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET THAT INFORMATION AFTER MULTIPLE REQUESTS THAN IT TAKES US TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT INFORMATION IS PROVIDED. SO I TO YOUR POINT I KNOW I DO UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE TIME FACTOR BUT IF YOU GUYS ARE DOING A GREAT JOB I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT. AND I WILL BE THE FIRST ONE TO SEND OUT A LETTER INTO A PRESS RELEASE ON YOUR BEHALF AND HOW. ELLIE COUNTY SHOULD MODEL AFTER YOUR PRACTICES BECAUSE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN LA COUNTY IS NOT GOOD FOR THE RESIDENTS. SO TO THAT POINT YU KNOW THANK YOU AGAIN FOR PROVIDING THIS INFORMATION BUT TO YOU IT'S NOT A GOTCHA WE WANT TO TAKE YOUR WHAT YOU'RE DOING. AND MODEL AFTER YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE OTHER AS- SHERIFF DEPARTMENTS ARE DOING THE SAME THING AND I JUST AN ALLEY COUNTY BUT IF ACROSS THE STATE. IF THERE ARE PROBLEMS IN THOSE OTHER AGENCIES THAN YOUR WHAT YOU'RE DOING SHOULD BE A MODEL FOR THE STATE NOT JUST FOR ELLIE MONEY. THANK YOU. I WANT. THOSE WELL. THANK YOU FOR THAT ALICE WOULD THE ASSEMBLY WILL INVERTER INTO THE GUNS YEAH I LIKE TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF THE SOME MEMBER WILL BE THAT WAS WELL. MAYBE THE- THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CAN GO THROUGH AND KIND OF OUTLINE WHY YOU CHOSE THESE THREE COUNTIES BECAUSE CLEARLY OF ARTICULATED THE PUBLIC ACCESS ISSUES WITH THE INFORMATION FOR ALAMEDA AND LA RIGHT RIGHT- MAYBE YOU CAN ARTICULATE TO US WHY YOU'VE INCLUDED FRESNO IN THIS IS IT EXAMPLE OF THEY'RE DOING IT WELL OR HOW THEY GOT INCLUDED IN THIS AUDIT NOT HELP CLARIFY. SOME OF THE INFORMATION BE HAPPY TO WE- LOOKED AT THE COUNTY- DEPARTMENTS THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THE STATE. AND DETERMINE THAT WITH AN INCREASE IN DEATHS THAT WERE HAPPENING WITHIN THE COUNTY JAIL IN FRESNO THAT THAT WAS A TRIGGER LOOKING OUT ARTICLES AND RESEARCH THAT HAS BEEN DONE ON SOME OF THE OTHER COUNTY FACILITIES IN THE STATE ALAMEDA IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY HAVE BUBBLED UP REPEATEDLY. EITHER FOR A GROWTH IN THE SPENDING EVEN THOUGH YOU'VE SEEN POPULATION DECREASES IN THE COUNTY JAILS OR WITH A TUG OF WAR THAT'S HAPPENING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WITH REGARDS TO BALLOONING- BUDGETS AND LACK OF ACCESS. SO THAT'S WHY THOSE THREE WERE SELECTED. IN FRESNO COUNTY HAS A LEGITIMATE VALIDATED. AUDIT THE DAY OF RECENTLY COMPLETED. WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THAT BE SHARED WITH THE STATE AUDITOR'S DEPARTMENT BECAUSE THAT COULD INFORM A NUMBER OF THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE ASKED IN THE SCOPE. AND COULD ALSO PROVIDE SOME INCREDIBLY RICH DATA TO BE SHARED WITH THE OTHER COUNTIES ARE ALSO BEING AUDITED THIS IS NOT A GOTCHA BUT WE ARE INCREDIBLY CONCERNED WITH THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT CONTINUES TO GO TO EACH OF THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT IT'S AN INORDINATELY HIGH NUMBER. AND THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THE FUNDING IS BEING USED IT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S BEING USED POORLY. DOES NOT AN INDICTMENT BUT IT IS A REQUEST FOR THE INFORMATION AND YOU CAN OFFER INFORMATION AND I OBJECTIVE WAY IT'S CALLED DATA AND THEN YOU USE THAT TO SAY HOW CAN WE BE HELPFUL EITHER THROUGH LEGISLATION OR REGULATION TO HELP SHIP OR WORK WITH YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOU'RE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO MAYBE INCREASING FUNDING AND PROGRAMS THAT WORK DIVERTING INTO PILOT PROGRAMS THAT WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE GIVEN WHAT MAYBE YOU'VE BEEN TRYING RIGHT OR EXPERIMENTING WITH IN YOUR OWN COUNTY. FOUR HUNDRED FOR RIDE SOME. GLOBAL DECISION MAKING AUTHORITY AROUND THINGS THAT ARE NOT WORKING BUT YOU KNOW THERE HAS TO BE A REASON WHY FORTY SOME FOLKS DIED IN THE COUNTY JAIL. WE WANT TO KNOW WHY THERE'S OVER SPENDING WITH REGARDS TO SOME OF LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL AND MAYBE A DIVERSION AND PROGRAMMING AND HATE MAYBE THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE HAVE MADE. WILL TURN OUT NOT TO BE TRUE BASED ON THE DATA THAT WE RECEIVE BUT IT ALSO DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR US TO SIT AROUND WITH ASSUMPTIONS WITHOUT HAVING THE DATA TO EITHER PROVE OR DISPROVE WHAT WE'RE THINKING AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING AND WHAT WE'RE READING. THANK YOU I AM A SENATOR GONZALEZ PLEASE. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS REQUEST I AM CERTAINLY MOST CONCERNED WITH LA COUNTY BEING IN LA COUNTY MEMBER- BECAUSE I KNOW WE HAVE THE LARGEST SYSTEM AND NOT ONLY THIS STATE BUT THE COUNTRY AND YOU KNOW CERTAINLY A LOT OF CONCERNS THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS THERE SO I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS FORWARD. AND ARTICULATING THIS IN A WAY THAT IS SO VERY- RESPONSIVE TO OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY THEY'RE ASKING FOR PAIN. NOW BUT I ALSO KNOW JUST RESPECTIVE TO WHAT SENATOR ROBB MENTIONED AND GIVEN THE LANDSCAPE OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH IN THIS COMMITTEE JUST TODAY. MYSELF INCLUDED- WONDERING IF THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY I KNOW THAT. TO YOUR- POINTS THAT FRESNO IN ALAMEDA HAVE NOT BEEN RESPONSIVE. ON'T WITH THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HAVEN'T BEEN RESPONSIVE NECESSARILY. I'M SORRY LOS ANGELES MY APOLOGIES GOT THAT WRONG. SO IF WELL I MEAN AS THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HAD ASKED FOR IT AND THAT WAS DENIED. OKAY SO THAT WENT TO THE BOARD SO ALAMEDA NOT TONIGHT OKAY. WORKING FROM A PRIVATE COUNTY I MEAN THIS STAKEHOLDERS IN THE DAY WITH A NINE HUNDRED MEN'S GROUP NO RIGHT OKAY A LOT NO GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL AFTER THAT. SO GIVEN THE FACT THAT I THINK ARE COLLEAGUES ALSO WANT TO BE IN. INCLUDED IN THE DISCUSSIONS GOING FORWARD POTENTIALLY. IT SEEMS LIKE THEY DO- IS IT POSSIBLE TO START WITH LA COUNTY AND THEN PERHAPS FEES IN FRESNO AND ALAMEDA AT LIKE A THREE MONTH POINT. AFTER THERE'S- STILL NO RESPONSE JUST A SUGGESTION WELL I THINK WE WERE CERTAIN WE WOULD BE OPEN TO- THE STARTING WITH ALAMEDA AND LOS ANGELES AND THEN PHASING IN FRESNO GIVEN THEY ARE THE ONLY COUNTY THAT. YOU KNOW HAS COME HERE TO STATE THAT THEY HAVE JUST COMPLETED ON IT BUT ALAMEDA HAS NOT. OKAY WHEN YOU HAVE LOS ANGELES. RESPONSE NO RESPONSE OKAY. GREAT PREP STATE AUDITOR YOU COULD. SO I NEED TO BE CLEAR ON WHAT THE EXPECTATION IS BECAUSE OF THE AUDIT IS APPROVED WE CAN CERTAINLY START IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY SAN THE TEAM THEIR FIRST. AND THEN SEND THAT THE THAT HAVE THE TEAM GO TO ALAMEDA COUNTY NEXT BUT WE WOULD STILL GO TO FRESNO COUNTY- AND CONDUCT THE SAME PROCEDURES IT WOULD JUST BE OUT. FOR A COUPLE MONTHS FROM NOW AS FAR AS WHEN WE GET TO FRESNO VERSES LA OR ALAMEDA. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE IT WAS CLEAR TO THE COMMITTEE THAT WE WOULD STILL BE AUDITING FRESNO. BOB IF THE IF THE- THE REQUESTED APPROVED BY THE COMMITTEE. UNDERSTOOD REMOVED HIS SOMEONE MEMBER PATTERSON YEAH THIS CENTER BOARD JUST HOPEFULLY BRIEFLY. HEY WE SEVEN ADDITIONAL ITEM ON THE AGENDA. FOR THE RECORD I WOULD LIKE TO JUST MAKE SURE I WANT TO ASK THE SHERIFF UP FROM FRESNO TO REITERATE WHEN. WERE YOU NOTIFIED THAT YOU ARE SUBJECT OF THE AUDIT. I RECEIVED AN EMAIL ON WEDNESDAY THE NINETEENTH. WERE YOU AT THAT TIME OR ANY TIME SUBSEQUENT TO THAT. ASK FOR ANY SUPPORTIVE DATA ANY DIRECT INFORMATION ANY AUDITS OR ANY OTHER INFORMATION. NO YOU KNOW MISTER CHAIRMAN OF UNDER ON TO THAT OUGHT TO BE HONEST THAT THAT TO ME WE REALLY. THIS IS NOT A FAIR AND UNBIASED ASSETS FRESNO COUNTY HAS BEEN THROWN IN TO TWO OTHER COUNTIES THAT HAVE APPARENTLY SOME. CONFLICT OR SOME SOME KIND OF RIGHT SO I CAN'T VOTE FOR THIS AND I REALLY WISH MY COLLEAGUES WOULD SAY- YOU GOT TWO OF THEM UP HERE YOU WANT AUDIT FINE FRESNO COUNTY I THINK SHOULD BE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY. TO RESPOND AND TO BE A AT TO BE ABLE TO DIRECTLY ANSWER THE BASIC. QUESTIONS AS TO FIRST OF ALL WHAT DO YOU SPENDING YOUR MONEY ON. 97% IS GOING OUT THE DOOR. AND NUMBER TWO. THAT THAT THE AUDIT IS IN FULL VIEW EXCEPT HERE. THANK THANK YOU MISTER PATTERSON EITHER WASN'T A QUESTION THERE WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO CENTER BORE GISTS BUT THOSE MISTER PATTERSON'S REQUEST AND- WE JUST COMMENT THAT NO WE USUALLY GIVE DEFERENCE TO THE MEMBER THAT REQUEST THE AUDIT TO CHANGED SCOPE WITHIN THE ALLOTTED TIME- SO WITH THAT WILL LOSE CENTER BORDERS IN THE HOME I'LL BE BRIEF. I THINK. I THINK THAT INTO A CENTER GONZALEZ HAD- PUTTING FORWARD AN IDEA THAT. I THINK COULD SATISFY EVERYONE'S INTEREST YOUR DESIRE FOR INFORMATION AND OUR DESIRE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S AN APPROPRIATE PROCESS THAT IS HONORED- I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT. BASED ON THE- AN INFORMATION SHEET WHICH SPECIFICALLY REQUEST INFORMATION ON WHAT STEPS TAKEN WERE TAKEN. TO OBTAIN INFORMATION THAT FORM THE BASIS HAVING NOT GOTTEN RESPONSES THAT FORMS THE BASIS OF THE AUDIT. SO HOW ABOUT THIS. THAT ARE YOU MENTIONED- THAT IN AUDIT LIKE THIS WOULD TAKE ABOUT SIX MONTHS THAT WE SAID THAT'S CORRECT SENATOR HOW ABOUT THIS WHAT IF WE WERE TO- AUTHORIZE. THE AUDIT OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY BECAUSE CLEARLY THERE'S SOME HISTORY THERE WHERE INFORMATION IS NOT BEEN DISCLOSED. AND IN THE- IN THE IN THE INTERIM OVER THE NEXT. TWO MONTHS. THAT ALL THE INFORMATION THAT YOU ARE REQUESTING BE PRODUCED BY BOTH ALAMEDA AND FRESNO FRESNO PARTICULAR BECAUSE I REPRESENT THAT AREA- THAT THEY PROVIDE ALL THE INFORMATION. THAT YOU ARE REQUESTING IF FOR SOME REASON THE DO NOT PROVIDE INFORMATION TO YOUR SATISFACTION. THEN WE'RE MEETING HERE IN AUGUST IS THAT THE NEXT AVAILABLE MEETINGS THAT AUGUST GERMAN CORRECT AND I HAD JUST CONFERRING WITH THE RULES AS WELL AS WE CAN ACTUALLY. IF IT'S UP TO THE AUTHOR SHE WANTED TO EXCLUDE ONE OF THE CONTY SETS HER PER WHAT THE THAN FOR VICE LEE IT IS IF YOU WERE JOKES COLLUDED THAT. IN IF THEY'RE NOT COMPLYING. BRING THIS MATTER BACK IN IOWA ACTUALLY SUPPORT THE AUDIT OF MY OWN COUNTY UNDER THOSE VERY UNIQUE. BUT HOT HARDLY FORESEEABLE CIRCUMSTANCES. THAT I THINK GET YOU EVERYTHING YOU WANT WELL IT DOESN'T PENALIZE FOLKS. WERE BLINDLY BEING BROUGHT INTO THIS PROCESS. WHEN THEY WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN WILLING TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO YOUR PURSUIT OF IT. WAS SENATOR I UNFORTUNATELY DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO CONDUCT MY OWN AUDIT IN MY OFFICE- AND IF I'M HEARING YOU. THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT YOU WOULD BE ASKING OF ME. ARE YOU HAVE NINE QUESTIONS THAT YOU ARE PROPOSING THE SCOPE OF THIS AUDIT. CERTAINLY CERTAINLY. ARE A RESPONSE FROM- FROM A COUNTY. WOULD BE ABLE TO ANSWER THESE NINE QUESTIONS. WITH RELATIVE EASE. THAT WOULD BE MY HOPE TO BUT THAT IS- THE HOPE THAT I'M NOT WILLING TO PUT IN THE BANK I KNOW THAT WE HAVE A STATE AUDITOR'S DEPARTMENT WHO IS GOT THAT PROFESSIONAL. A CAPACITY AS WELL AS THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO CONDUCT THIS AND I CERTAINLY WOULD NOT WANT TO. OVERSTEP MY PAY GRADE IN TRYING TO GO AHEAD OF THE LEGISLATOR AND CONDUCT AN AUDIT. I AM CERTAINLY WILLING TO CONSIDER SOME DEGREE OF FLEXIBILITY WITH REGARDS TO THE AUDIT. AND HAVING ALAMEDA LOS ANGELES BE PART OF THE FIRST WAVE. AND THEN HAVE FRESNO SENSE AS THEY MENTIONED. THEY HAVE JUST COMPLETED AN AUDIT IN HAVING 97% OF FUNDING GO OUT THE DOOR IS ONE THING KNOWING HOW IT IS BEING SPENT AS SOMETHING ELSE AND THAT'S WHAT YOU FIND WHEN YOU CONDUCT AN AUDIT. SO I'VE I CAN I WOULD LIKE TO COUNTER. YOUR OFFER- BY ASKING FOR THOSE TWO TO BE AUDITED FIRST. FOUR THANK YOU THERE'S YOUR ANSWER ME THIS BOERNER HORVATH IF WE COULD MOVE QUICKLY WAS EVIDENT TIONAL ITEMS ON THE AGENDA I KNOW WHEN I'M LYING IS ON THE AGENDA TOO- I APPRECIATE THE ASSEMBLYMEMBER. STAGGERING THAT OUT AND SAYING ALAMEDA AND LA WHERE CLEARLY. YOU THERE HAVE BEEN A REQUESTED INFORMATION HAS NOT COME BACK- HE'S- SO. ALSO ADULT WAS THE TEST OF I'M SORRY. PLEASE WAS BORDERLINE I THOUGHT I HEARD FROM THE REQUESTED- OUR COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLYMEMBER COMMA OTHER THAN THAT INFORMATION IS REQUESTED AND I AM GOING WITH WHAT MY COLLEAGUE SAYS PLEASE DO NOT INTERRUPT ME. AND I DO THINK THERE'S A VALUE IF FRESNO IS ALREADY DONE WE'VE WE'VE DEALT WITH THIS ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS LAST YEAR IF FRESNO IS ALREADY DONE THAT ON IT MAYBE THE STATE ORDER CAN CAN CHIME IN IF THAT INFORMATION IS ALREADY THERE YOU'RE NOT DUPLICATING THE INFORMATION SORRY THERE YOU'RE PROVING OF THAT INFORMATION SATISFIES. THE REQUEST OF THE IDEA IS THAT CORRECT IS NOT ADDITIONAL AUDITING OF AN EXISTING ARE ADDED THAT IS CORRECT SO TO THE EXTENT AN AUDIT HAS BEEN DONE WE WILL LOOK AT THAT WORK DETERMINE WHETHER WE CAN RELY ON IT IF IT'S DONE BY A REPUTABLE FIRM I WOULD ASSUME WE WOULD BE ABLE TO RELY ON IT. WE WOULD WE WOULD. WANT TO MAKE SURE WE COULD RELY ON THE INFORMATION IF WE DEEM THAT WE CAN RELY ON IT THEN WE WILL NOT DUPLICATE. THE WORK THAT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE WE WILL USE THAT WORK TO ANSWER SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ASKED. SO IN THEORY THIS COULD ACTUALLY REDUCE ACTION THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HOURS. IF THE WORK THAT FRESNO HAS BEEN DONE. SATISFIES THE QUESTIONS OF THE AUDIT AS WELL CORRECT THAT IS CORRECT OKAY. OR IF THANK GOODNESS ADAM AT THE REALLY IMPORTANT UNLESS IT WAS A DIRECT QUESTION TO YOU WE NEED TO MOVE ON. OKAY AT THIS TIME HEARING AND SEEING NO MORE. QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE DíAS. LET'S GO TO MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JOHN LINDSAY POLAND I'M WITH THE AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE A HERE IN REPRESENTATION OF MORE THAN FIFTY COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS FROM ALAMEDA COUNTY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS REQUEST. WE HAVE WORKED FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS IN ALAMEDA COUNTY TO TRY TO GET A PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL AUDITS OF THE ALAMEDA COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE THAT A REQUEST HAS ALSO BEEN SUPPORTED MORE THAN A YEAR AGO. BY A LETTER FROM SENATOR SKINNER WHOSE DISTRICT DICTION OF THIS IS IN WHO ALSO CALLS FOR A FULL PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL AUDITS I WOULD NOTE THAT THE ALAMEDA COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE USE ONE ON A AB ONE ONLINE FUNDS. IS COMPLETELY OPAQUE IT IS NOT AVAILABLE ON ANY PUBLICLY AVAILABLE SITE. ED NOT THAT LONG AGO SHERIFF A HER THEMSELVES SAID PUBLICLY THAT HE WELCOMES AN AUDIT. AND I WOULD SAY FINALLY THAT- HOW THE FUNDS ARE I DON'T AS MY UNDERSTAND IT OTHER AUDITS AND REPORTS AND POTENTIALLY EVEN THE ONE FOR FRESNO. ARE NOT ACTUALLY ASKING HOW ARE THE FUNDS THAT THE SHERIFF'S ARE USING FURTHERING THE PURPOSE OF AB ONE ON THE LINE FOR NINE AND QUIRK INCARCERATION pOUT BY MISTER CLAYTON JOHNSON.

JOSH DUGGAR WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES. JUST WANNA MAKE IT CLEAR WE HAVE NO CONCERNS WITH TRANSPARENCY IN REALIGNMENT SPENDING AND WELCOME THAT CONVERSATION. HOWEVER WE DID WANT TO NOTE THAT THE YEAR IT THERE IS A ANNUAL REPORTING FROM COUNTIES TO THE BOARD OF STATE COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS AND REPORTS POSTED ON THE- SEC'S WEBSITE. I THINK THE REPORTS YOU KNOW APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED PAGES INCLUDES INFORMATION ABOUT. PROGRESS IN ACHIEVING OUTCOMES IDENTIFIED IN C. C. P. PLANS. ON ALLOCATION OF FUNDING BETWEEN DEPARTMENTS PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT ARE- TARGETED. AND THERE IS THE ANNUAL FUNDING AND THE ON BOARD OF SAYING COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS BUDGET THAT FUNDS. THE GATHERING OF THE C. C. P.'S IN EACH COUNTY AND COUNTIES DON'T RECEIVE THOSE FUNDS UNLESS THEY- RESPOND TO ALL THE QUESTIONS AND INFORMATION. REQUESTED BY STATE. I WILL SKIP THE PIECE ABOUT THE CONTEXT SETTING ON TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN REALIGNMENT I THINK WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT ALREADY BUT- JUST ONE MAKE IT CLEAR COUNTY STEPPED. UP TO PARTNER WITH THE STATE. TO HELP SOLVE A VERY COMPLEX PROBLEM. AND THE SOLUTION THAT WAS AGREED UPON- DID NOT INCLUDE TRYING TO MAKE EVERY. COUNTY IN THE STATE LOOK LIKE EACH OTHER NOR LOOK LIKE THE STATE SYSTEM- SO LIKE I SAID- WE ARE. OPEN TO TRANSPARENCY IN FURTHER CONVERSATIONS BUT- JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE. IT'S CLEAR WHAT INFORMATION IS OUT THERE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT PLEASE. A MAKE A MOTEL WITH THE YOUNG WOMEN'S FREEDOM CENTER AND THIS IS TO WORRY YEARS FREEDOM COALITION.

MISSIONAL TESTIMONY MISTER CHAIRMAN WRIST CORSAGE ALONG HAVE THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION ON SUPPORTER IN OPPOSITION TO THE REQUEST. BUT WE JUST NOTE THAT REALIGNMENT WAS A MONUMENTAL REFORM.

TO ADDRESS NOT ONLY ALTERNATIVES TO ARBITRATE PRISONER RELEASES THAT WOULD HAVE RESULTED FROM THE PRISON OVERCROWDING- BUT TO ADDRESS LOCAL SYSTEM NEEDS WE STARTED WITH FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT SPOTS. WE HAVE TO REALIZE THAT FLEXIBILITY IN THIS IS VITAL- THE PLANS FOR EACH COUNTY ARE ON THE BSE SEE WEBSITE. THEY ARE UPDATED- THE BE A C. C.

OKAY THAT ITEMS ON CALL LEAVE A FOR ADDITIONAL MEMBERS THAT ON THANK YOU. OKAY MEMBERS AT THIS TIME WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO AGENDA ITEM NUMBER SIXTEEN TWENTY TWENTY DASH ONE ONE FOR CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION PROGRAMS BY SENATOR BRADFORD. AS A ROUGH FOR WHEN YOU'RE READY TO BEGIN PLEASE. THANK YOU. I AFTER AN AFTERNOON AFTERNOON HAVE BEEN HERE SINCE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS WE'RE HERE TODAY ON THE ISSUE THAT IS NOT NEW TO ANY OF US HERE IT'S ONE THAT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED- BOTH OPENLY AND BEHIND CLOSED DOORS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS OF MY NINE YEARS OF BEING HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE'S A ISSUE THAT HAS ALWAYS RISEN ITSELF AND LOOKING AT HOW EFFECTIVE WE ARE ALLOCATING MONEY. TO TRANSPORTATION CLIMATE PROGRAMS AND TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN BUDGET FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE MILLION AND G. G. R. F. MONEY WAS ALLOCATED TO CAR LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS IN TOTAL GARBAGE BIN OUT ALLOCATED TWO POINT TWO BILLION AGAIN TWO POINT TWO BILLION FORCE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS. THIS INCLUDES LIGHT AND HEAVY DUTY EQUIPMENT PROGRAMS. THE CALIFORNIA VEHICLE- RECYCLING PROGRAM SCHOOL BUS REPLACEMENT AND OTHER PROGRAMS AND YET THE LEGISLATIVE LEGISLATURE. HAS NOT ORDERED A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THE THIRTY TWO TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS AT CAR. THERE ARE BE REVIEWS OF CERTAIN PROGRAMS LIKE THE CALL CARL MARKET MORE YOUR PROGRAM- BUT THAT WAS OVER THIRTEEN YEARS AGO. SOME CAR PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN SCOPED INTO MULTI AGENCY AUDITS BUT NOT A SIMILAR AUDIT AS IT RELATES TO CARPET SO. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE ATTEMPTED TO ASSESS THE COST IN GOLD THE VARIOUS CAR PROGRAMS BY THE END OF THE YEAR THOSE COMMUNITIES WERE ABLE TO DO SO TO JUST FIVE OF THOSE PROGRAMS. FOUR YEARS LATER THEY'RE STILL NOT BEEN AN OVER ARCHING REVIEW OF ALL THESE PROGRAMS AND THEIR AGGREGATED A FAX AS A RESULT. AND AS OF- THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE HAS TOLD US WE DO NOT HAVE COMPLETE. A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE VARIOUS PROGRAMS AND AS LEGISLATORS I THINK WE WOULD ALL WANT TO KNOW THE ANSWERS TO THAT. THE REQUEST IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PUT THIS QUESTION TO BED ONCE AND FOR ALL A MOVE FOR WHAT A COMMON UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOESN'T. THE ONLY GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW AGAIN IT ONLY MAKES SENSE WE CAN ASSESS. THESE PROGRAMS BASED ON THE COST OF EACH METRIC TONS OF CARBON DIOXIDE THE REDUCE. AND THAT MEASURE VERY SIGNIFICANTLY SOME PROGRAMS COSTS. LESS IS HUNDRED ALL THE TIME WELL THERE'S OTHER PROGRAMS IT'S COST AS MUCH AS THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS A TODD AGAIN WE SHOULD WANT TO KNOW THOSE COST. BUT A FEW METRICS DOESN'T GET THE UNDERSTANDING TO THE QUESTIONS HERE. WHICH IS HOW EFFECTIVE ARE THESE PROGRAMS WORKING TOGETHER AS A WHOLE. ALTOGETHER THESE PROGRAMS REPRESENT A MASSIVE AGGREGATE AND INVESTMENT IN LOW CARBON FUTURE CARP HAS BEEN AUDITED BEFORE BUT IT'S TRANSPORTATION CLIMATE PROGRAMS HAVE NOT BEEN ANALYZED IN RECENT YEARS THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE TRIED TO TAKE AN INITIAL SURVEY OF THESE PROGRAMS. THE LACK OF CONSISTENT POLICY EVALUATION POTENTIAL FOR COUNTERPRODUCTIVE I MISSION SHUFFLING AND SOME AMOUNT OF ON QUANTIFIABLE RESOURCES ARE BEING WASTED FOR FREE RIGHTS WHAT CAR IS MADE DATA AVAILABLE ON PROGRAM SPENDING IT IS STILL UNCLEAR HOW THEY INTERACT AND WHAT THAT MEANS FOR NET CARBON REDUCTIONS ARE. AS WE'VE SEEN IN THE LECTURE CITY SECTOR SOMETIMES PROGRAMS ARE COMBINED. SO SOMETIME PROGRAM COMBINED EFFECTS LEAD TO A MISSION SHUFFLING RATHER THAN NET REDUCTIONS IT IS ALSO UNCLEAR IF WE ARE UNDER UNDER UNDER FUNDING PROGRAMS. WITH EFFICIENT ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COST OR OVER FUNDING INEFFICIENT PROGRAMS TAKE THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES FOR EXAMPLE WHICH IS IN MY DISTRICT PORCH LEAD TO STAY ON DEVELOPING SHIP TO SHORE POWER. HOWEVER CARPOOL. AT BIRTH. PROPOSED RULE ARE SIGNIFICAN MORE THE EMPIRE REQUIREMENTS IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT IF ANYTHING CARP IS DOING WITH THESE POLICIES TO ENSURE OUR PORTS STAY COMPETITIVE TO PRIVATIZE COST EFFECTIVENESS REQUIREMENTS AND TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP A ROBUST LABOR FORCE AGAIN MEMBERS WE WILL NOT BE THE FIFTH LEADING ECONOMY IF OUR PORCH SHUT DOWN. WHAT OUT AUDIT WE WILL NOT KNOW IF CARBS PROGRAMS ARE PRIORITIZE A LEASE COSTS BEST FITS WHAT OUT OF AUDIT WE WILL NOT KNOW WHETHER THESE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM TO HELP IN THE STATE DEVELOP AN EQUITABLE AND DIVERSE WORKFORCE FOR EXAMPLE IF SIT SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF INSTEAD OF DOLLARS ARE GOING TO WEALTHY FREE RIGHTS THEN THE POLICY NEEDS TO BE CHANGED WE REFORM. THEIR UP THE C. B. R. P. PROGRAM TO FOCUS ON MIDDLE AND WORKING CLASS FAMILIES BUT HOW MANY OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS HAVE THE SAME STRUCTURAL INADEQUACIES ALL THIS AUDIT WOULD ALSO A SENSE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS GIVEN CAR A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITIES AND I SUPPORT CARDS EFFORTS JUST LIKE I SUPPORT CLIMATE INVESTMENTS. IF FOR THESE READ ALONE. THAT I CARE ABOUT THE CONTINUED EXISTENCE AND I WANT THEM TO BE FAIR AND EFFECTIVE BASED ON ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COSTS AND THAT'S WHY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY. THANK YOU SENATOR- MADAM HONOR PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AS AS A SENATOR BRADFORD INDICATED THAT IT WOULD BE AN AUDIT OF THE CAR PROGRAM AND T WOULD BE SPECIFIC TO THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. SO STARTING OUT IDENTIFYING THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF PROGRAMS AS HE INDICATED THERE'S APPROXIMATELY THIRTY FOUR PROGRAMS BUT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THIS THE TYPE. OF PROGRAM AND WHAT WHAT THE INTENT OF THAT PARTICULAR PROGRAM IS AND THAT TIES TO THE NEXT OBJECTIVE WHICH WOULD BE. LOOKING AT THE EXTENT TO WHICH ANY OF THESE PROGRAMS OVERLAP ONE ANOTHER AND HOW THEY- INTERACT WITH ONE ANOTHER. AND THEN HE'S ASKING US TO LOOK AT A SELECTION OF THESE PROGRAMS OF THESE GHG ARM GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTION PROGRAMS. AGAIN SPECIFICALLY IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR- AND DETERMINE WHETHER FIRST OF ALL WHETHER CARB DOES ANY ASSESSMENT OR EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTS OF THE PROGRAMS ON COMMUNITIES. AND HOUSEHOLDS OUT WHAT AFTER THAT AFTER THEY IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAMS. AND IF THAT'S NOT HAPPENING WHICH IT APPEARS THAT IT ISN'T FOR ALL PROGRAMS- HE'S ASKING US TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE. ASSESS HOW EACH OF THESE PROGRAMS AFFECT HOUSEHOLDS IN COMMUNITIES WE MAY NEED TO HIRE A CONSULTANT TO ASSIST US WITH THAT BUT WE'VE DONE THAT IN THE PAST. IN ADDITION- SOME OF THE ADDITIONAL OBJECTIVES RELATED TO THE SELECTION OF PROGRAMS WOULD BE. AS CENTER BRADFORD REFER TO IT AS SHUFFLING IS IT REALLY A REDUCTION OR IS IT A SHIFTING OF. THE MISSIONS RATHER THAN AN ELIMINATION OF THOSE PARTICULAR MISSION THAT'S MOVING THE EMISSIONS ARE SHUFFLING AS A SENATOR REFERRED TO IT. ALSO LOOKING AT THE PROGRAMS IN THEIR COST EFFECTIVENESS- INCLUDING SOCIAL BENEFITS AND COSTS AND COMPARE THE PROGRAMS OUT TO ONE ANOTHER. FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE. ALSO LOOKING AT WHETHER OR NOT CARP STRATEGIES ARE REDUCING THE OCCURRENCE OF A PARTICULAR ISSUE HOW WELL ARE THESE PROGRAMS WORKING. AND ENCOURAGING PARTICIPANTS TO REDUCE. GREENHOUSE GAS. EMISSIONS ARE. REDUCED AND THEIR ACTIVITIES ARE PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO VEHICLES- ALSO A COUPLE OF OTHER OBJECTIVES HE'S ASKED US TO LOOK AT IS ASSESSING THE PROCESS CAR MUSES WHEN THEY- WHEN THEY DRAFT THEIR INITIAL STATEMENT OF REASONS WHEN THEY'RE PROPOSING A NEW PROGRAM. FOR THE SPECIFICALLY AGAIN FOR THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR AND HE'S ASKED US A FEW THINGS RELATED TO THAT. HOW DOES CARB CONSIDER THE EFFECTS OF THE PROGRAM ON AIR QUALITY THE ENVIRONMENT THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS THE OVERALL ECONOMY AND CERTAINLY HOW WITH THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM AFFECT LOW INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES- AGAIN. WITH RESPECT TO THE INITIAL STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR A NEW PROGRAM. HOW IS CARP CONSIDERING POTENTIAL INTERACTIONS AGAIN AND EFFECTS WITH THE ALREADY EXISTING PROGRAMS ARE THEY TAKING THAT INTO CONSIDERATION. AND THEN FINALLY- ASKING FOR SUGGESTED CHANGES- WHETHER THERE NEED TO BE ANY CHANGES TO ANY OF THESE PROGRAMS- AND WHETHER THOSE CHANGES CAN BE. CHANGED THROUGH LEGISLATIVE ACTION OR THROUGH REGULATION BY CARB THEMSELVES OF THE AUDIT IS ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED HOURS AS I INDICATED- BECAUSE OF STE THE TECHNICAL NATURE OF SOME OF THIS WILL MAKE A DETERMINATION IF THE AUDITS APPROVED. WE NEED TO HIRE A CONSULTANT TO ASSIST US WE CERTAINLY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO THAT- AND THE ABILITY TO DEATH WITH THAT MISTER CHAIR ALTERNATE BACK TO YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ARE THE SAME GOING TO MOVE TO THE AFFECTED AGENCIES. PLEASE. ARE A TIME THANK YOU CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MY NAME'S RICHARD CORY I'M THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD I'M JOINED HERE WITH OUR LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR DR DAVID GARCIA. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S APPROACH TO REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND IT'S IMPORTANT. AIR POLLUTION FROM THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. THE CHIEF STATE AND FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING HEALTH BASED AIR QUALITY STANDARDS CALIFORNIA USES A MIX OF MANDATES INCENTIVES AND MARKET MECHANISMS MEANING MANY OF CARBS PROGRAMS ACHIEVE A TRIPLE BANG FOR THE BUCK BY ONE. REDUCING EMISSIONS OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES AND TRADITIONAL AIR POLLUTANTS THAT DIRECTLY IMPACT PUBLIC HEALTH TO REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THAT AFFECT CLIMATE CHANGE AND THREE. CHEATING COST EFFECTIVE AND EQUITABLE OUTCOMES NOW AS FOR HOW CARBS MISSION RELATES TO THIS AUDIT. AB THREE NINETY EIGHT BY ASSEMBLYMAN. GARCIA AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN EXTENDED THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM ADDITIONALLY. AB THREE NINETY EIGHT REQUIRED THE LA- TO REPORT ON THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS AND BENEFITS OF CALIFORNIA'S. GHG EMISSIONS GOALS THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN LA- REPORT SPUR THE AUDIT REQUEST FOR THIS COMMITTEE BUT UNFORTUNATELY. CAR WAS NOT AFFORDED THE OPPORTUNITY RESPOND. NOR WERE EVEN AWARE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN POSED UNTIL. I RECEIVED THE REQUEST TO APPEAR BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE LAST WEDNESDAY. WHAT THE COMMITTEE MAY FIND HELPFUL TO KNOW IS THAT THE LA AUDIT REPORT IS CONSTRAINED BY STATUTE TO FOCUS NARROWLY ON GHG REDUCTIONS GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS IT DOES NOT CONSIDER THE OTHER STATE AND FEDERAL MANDATES ON CARBS PROGRAMS. THE CONSTRAINT ELIMINATES THE ABILITY OF THE REPORT TO ADDRESS THE OTHER KEY DRIVERS TO CALIFORNIA'S TRANSPORTATION STRATEGIES NAMELY. THE NEED TO REDUCE EMISSIONS THAT NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE HEALTH OF ALL CALIFORNIANS PARTICULARLY THOSE AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. SPECIFICALLY THE REPORT FOCUSES ON GHG EMISSIONS RATHER THAN A KEY DRIVER BEHIND THE MOBILE SOURCE MEASURES WHICH REDUCE DIESEL PARTICULATE MATTER. AS WELL SMOG FORMING POLLUTANTS ARE PREPARED TO RESPOND QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. BUT MY MAIN RESPONSE IS WHEN A DISAPPOINTMENT OVER THE FACT IT WOULD NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS AND RESPOND TO THE REQUEST. PRIOR TO APPEARING BEFORE YOU TODAY IN SUMMARY. I REQUEST OF THE COMMITTEE CONSIDER DIRECTING CARB TO WORK WITH SENATOR BRADFORD TO RESPOND AS QUESTIONS. SURE ANSWERED BE INSUFFICIENT COMMITTEE COULD CONSIDER APPROVING A REVISED AND BETTER INFORMED I REQUEST. AT THAT TIME THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR. RIGHT ADDITIONAL I THINK YOU'RE THE ONLY AFFECTED AGENCY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AT THE TIME WAS GOING TO TURN IT TO MEMBERS ON THE DíAS FOR QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD THEN CENTER BORDERS THANK YOU PLEASE VOTE THANK YOU- SENATOR BRADFORD FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD- I THINK THAT THE FACT THAT THERE WAS A POTENTIAL AUDIT REQUEST- LAST YEAR SHOULD HAVE GIVEN YOU PLENTY OF WARNING THAT WE WANTED ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ALTHOUGH THAT ARE DID MOVE FORWARD SO THIS SHOULDN'T REALLY BE A SURPRISE TO YOUR AGENCY QUITE FRANKLY- AND- I THINK THE QUESTIONS ARE VALID- YOU TALK ABOUT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES I'M GONNA GET A LITTLE LITTLE BIT ON THE SUB SOAP BOX HERE BUT- I REPRESENT SOME OF SOME POOR COMMUNITIES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE DON'T QUALIFY UNDER YOUR AND YOUR DEFINITION OF ENVIRO OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES BECAUSE IN GENERAL MOST OF THE YEAR UNLESS WE HAVE A WILD FIRE WHICH YOU GUYS DON'T WANT TO MEASURE THAT BY THE WAY- WE DON'T WE HAVE CLEAN AIR WE ALSO HAVE CLEAN WATER BECAUSE WE SUPPLY WATER TO A HUGE PART OF THE STATE. WE HAVE A LOT OF TREES AND THEY HAD TEND TO BE CARBON SINKS WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE AND MARK COMMUNITY THAT ARE- THAT HAVE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT HAVE RETROFIT REQUIREMENTS FOR TRACTORS FOR TRUCKS AND SO ONE AND THEY DON'T QUALIFY FOR A LOT OF PROGRAMS AND OTHER PEOPLE IN OTHER STATES THAT PART THE STATE DO AND WE'RE LOOKING AT G. H. G. PRODUCTION AS A STATEWIDE ISSUE WHY ARE YOU GUYS DISADVANTAGED PUTTING OUR COMMUNITIES AT A DISADVANTAGE BECAUSE G. H. G. IS A G. H. G WORDS GENERATED IN. THROUGHOUT AND I THINK THAT'S I THINK THAT'S A DISSERVICE TO- TO A LOT OF US IN IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO FEELS THIS WAY THE WHOLE COALITION OF FOLKS WITH THE BAY AREA- CAUCUS THAT FEEL THE SAME WAY AND I GET THAT WE WANT TO FOCUS ON THE COMMUNITIES THAT MAYBE NEED SOME OF THIS THE MOST BUT- I WOULD SAY THERE'S AN IN EQUITY FOR RURAL COMMUNITIES AND WE GIVE AN EXAMPLE EVERYBODY FOR X. THAT RURAL COMMUNITY. IT'S THE TO LIVE IS LOW THEIR- IT'S NOT. THE WE HAVE TO TRY. BY TRUCK. EVERYTHING INTO MY DISTRICT BECAUSE WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE A REAL PORT THAT THAT BRINGS GOODSAND SERVICES AND SO WE ARE INFLUENCED BY THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR SIX IT MAY NOT BE SO THAT THE AIR IS BROWN VISIBLY BROWN BUT WE ARE INFLUENCED BY THAT. AND SO. YOU THERE IS A FRUSTRATION AND IN EQUITY PART OF THIS THAT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT. AND IN IF YOUR DEPARTMENT AS WE'VE HEARD FROM OTHERS IS OTHER PEOPLE HERE IF. IF YOU'RE DOING EVERYTHING GREAT YOU SHOULD WELCOME THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHOWCASE HOW GOOD WHAT A GOOD JOB YOU'RE DOING. AND YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON NOTICE THERE BEEN MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS TO TRY TO GET INFORMATION ABOUT THIS AND YOU SHOULD OF BEEN ON NOTICE THAT THIS MIGHT BE COMING AT SOME POINT. BUT IT'S HERE AND I PLAN TO SUPPORT THIS- FOR THIS AND AMERICA BY THE REASONS. THANK YOU. HELLO MISTER WOULD YOU EXPECT A RESPONSE IF NOT WE'LL MOVE ON TO. PLEASE DON'T HI ACTION I JUMPING BIKE A APPS. LIKED RESPOND TO FEW FEW POINTS. ONE YOUR POINT OF DISOBEY COMMUNITIES. AND YOU'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT I BELIEVE G. G. R. F. CAP AND TRADE FOR EXPENDITURES WHICH ARE APPROPRIATE BY THE LEGISLATURE. BUT THEY ARE APPROPRIATE ACCORDING TO STATE LAW STATE LAW A. B. FIFTEEN FIFTY DEFINES EXPENDITURES AND THE PERCENTAGES THE NEED TO BE EXPANDED DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES NOW IT'S NOT ALL THE DOLLARS ARE SIGNIFICANT. A TRANSPORTATION FUNDING AND MANY OTHER PROGRAMS THE LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATES THOSE DOLLARS TWO DOZEN PLUS AGENCIES. THEY'RE GOING UP AND DOWN THE STATE IF THE POINT IS THERE'S NOT ENOUGH MONEY ABSOLUTELY THE POINT IS THOSE DOLLARS ARE MISSING CERTAIN COMMUNITIES ARE NEVER ENOUGH BUT THEY'RE CERTAINLY MULTIPLE EXAMPLES. OF A COMPETITIVE PROCESS ACROSS THE STATE IN TERMS OF HOW THOSE EXPENDITURES ARE DETERMINED AND I'D I'D SUBMIT AN THIS IS IMPORTANT. WHEN IT COMES TO THE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTION WITH FULLY FOLLOW IT WE FULLY FALL LEGISLATION THAT CONCERNS EXPENDITURESEXPENDITURE THOSE DOLLARS THEN GO THROUGH A FULL PUBLIC PROCESS YOU CAN TAKE A YEAR IN TERMS OF THE SOLICITATIONS THE GUIDANCE IN THE ULTIMATE WHERE THOSE DOLLARS. IN THOSE ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE POINT YOU MADE ABOUT THIS IS MUCH MORE THAN GHGS IT'S DIESEL PM IN FACT THE MENTIONED AT THE CENTER BRADFORD MADE OF FIVE AT BIRTH. BY THE PORTS THAT'S ABOUT DIESEL THAT'S LOCAL EXPOSURE TO DIESEL PM THE ADVERSELY IMPACTS PUBLIC HEALTH RELEASE ANY OF THE GHG ISSUE. SO PROCESS WISE. I ALWAYS OPEN TO HIM AND MAKE SURE THEM CLEAR AND HER OF LAW WE FOR. THE PROCESS WE GO THROUGH. IN THE FULL DISCLOSURE ALL WHAT WE JUST TALKED ABOUT IN TERMS OF EXPENDITURES. DOCUMENTED EVERY YEAR EVERY YEAR TO REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR ALL THOSE EXPENDITURES THOSE APPROPRIATED G.G. G. R. F. DOLLARS. REALLY IMPORTANT IN MY CONCERN ON THE SLEEVE WITH THE REQUEST. WASN'T THE ONE CONCERN WITH THE QUESTIONS ALL ABOUT GHGS WHEN MANY OF THE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS ACTUALLY ARE FOCUSED ON DIESEL AND KNOCKS NGH JENNINGS WAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY WORK FOR OF YOUR POINT ABOUT LAST YEAR WE RESPONDED IN WRITING I RESPOND IN WRITING MULTIPLE TIMES TO EVERY QUESTION THAT WAS RAISED AS WELL AS MET WITH THE CHAIR A FEW TIMES DOING OUR LEVEL BEST MY TO BE FULLY RESPONSIVE AND YOU'LL ALWAYS GET THAT FULL COMMITMENT TO BE FULLY RESPONSIVE. THANK YOU. CAN I MISSED HER WHAT LEASE JUST JUST YOU KNOW AS- A LITTLE BIT AT IS ALL THIS INFORMATION THAT YOU THESE REPORTS ARE THEY ALL ELIGIBLE ARE THEY ALL. TRANSPARENT TO THE PUBLIC THIS CAN PUBLIC SEE ALL THESE REPORTS YES. THE CHALLENGE AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR ON THIS BECAUSE IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A FAIR POINT BECAUSE THE POINT IS BEEN MADE BEFORE. IS THE OTHER AGENCIES FIFTY YEARS WITH FIFTY YEARS OLD THE NUMBER OF MOBILE SOURCE SPECIALS WHY DO WE HAVE ANOTHER MOBILE SOURCE MEASURES WE HAVE THIRTY VEHICLES OF CARS TRUCKS AND VARIOUS EQUIPMENT ON THE ROAD AGENCY. I HAS STRINGENT FEDERAL APARTMENTS IN TERMS OF IMPROVING YOUR QUALITY WHICH BY THE WAY CALIFORNIA'S AIR QUALITY IS VASTLY BETTER THAN IT USED TO BE. OF COURSE INFORMATION'S AVAILABLE BUT ONE THING IT WAS CLEAR IT WAS CLEAR TO ME. IS CLEARLY ACCESSING ANY INFORMATION ON THE WEB THAT CAN BE HARD. THAT CAN BE DIFFICULT WE'VE REVAMPED WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF REVAMPING THE WEBSITES OF THE SEARCH ENGINES MAKE IT EASIER TO FIND INFORMATION. AND RELATED BECAUSE I CAN BE TOUGH SO THAT SO THAT IS AN AREA THAT WE TOOK TO HEART. BASED ON THE LA OLD REPORT AS WELL AS THE PARENTS FOR THIS COMMITTEE LAST YEAR. I WOULD JUST I WOULD JUST SAY THAT I'M I'M GLAD YOU ARE BECAUSE- RECENTLY AT A AT A AT A CONFERENCE I WAS ASKED I ASKED THE CHAIR. WHY WHY- I WENT TO A WEB BUT WHEN YOUR WEB PAGES. AND SAID LAST REVIEWED MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN. I CAPTURED. THAT ON MY PHONE. AND THE ANSWER I GOT WAS SOME THIS. AND I'M- BY THAT FRANKLY. BUT MIRACULOUSLY MONDAY THAT WAS CHANGED IN THE LINKS I WAS ASKING FOR WERE THERE AND IT WAS IT WAS MIRACULOUSLY UPDATED. BUT THAT TROUBLES ME. THAT THAT ON SOMETHING RELATED TO WILDFIRES AND YOUR YOU HAD NO LINKS THERE WERE NO HYPERLINKS THERE. AND IT'D BEEN LAST REVIEWED AND SINCE. TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN. SO THAT MAKES ME WONDER. AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASON I WANT TO SUPPORT SENATOR BRADFORD. HOW MANY OTHER INSTANCES OF THESE KINDS OF THINGS AROUND THERE THERE WERE THERE ISN'T THE INFORMATION. THAT THAT THAT IS A IS AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE. YEAH I THINK AB. YOU KNOW AFTER IS THAT THINK IT'S A IT'S A FOR QUESTION THAT THIS COMMITTEES LOOKED AT IN THE PAST AS WELL MISTER WOULD YOU KNOW IN OTHER COMMITTEES AND SPA REALLY IN THE BUDGET HEARINGS AS WELL IN BOTH HOUSES AT. CENTER BRADFORD ALLUDED TO IS THE EASE OF WHICH TO FIND ALL THE INFORMATION BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES IT WAS. AND ONE PAGE THAT WAS RELATED TO ANOTHER AND IT SOUNDS LIKE MISTER COREY SAYING THEY'RE TRYING TO REVAMP THE- THE WEBSITE TO HELP MAKE THAT A LITTLE MORE MANAGEABLE HOPEFULLY AT. ADDRESSING SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE CONTINUE TO RAISE YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT IN THIS COMMITTEE- I DON'T GET BOGGED DOWN LET'S MOVE TO CENTER BORDERS. THANK YOU. COUPLE RANDOM QUESTIONS IF I MAY QUICKLY. CENTER BRADFORD DO YOU HAVE A SCIENCE BACKGROUND- OR SOME SORT OF- RELEVANT. EDUCATION IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS. SOMETHING LIKE THAT. NOT IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA BUT I WAS OF ALL THE MAJOR IN COLLEGE TO HAVE SUMMONS SALAS GERMAN DO YOU HAVE A SCIENCE BACKGROUND. NOT LICENSED ALL RIGHT- THE REASON WHY I ASK IS WE'VE HAD A COUPLE DISCUSSIONS TODAY ON WHAT THIS BODIES POLICIES SHOULD. BE LIKE IF WE'RE ASKING FOR INFORMATION. THIS IS A HIGHLY TECHNICAL AREA OF INQUIRY. TO ME THAT RISES TO THE LEVEL OF HAVING THE RESOURCES THAT- IN YOUR OFFICE CAN BRING TO BEAR ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE. IN THE EARLIER EXAMPLE THE LAST YEAR YOU REQUESTED ON A LOT OF INFORMATION AND WE HER JUST RECENTLY THAT YOU WERE RESPONSIVE TO OR YOU YOU RESPONDED TO THE REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. THAT TO RISE TO THE LEVEL THAT THE MAKER OF THE INQUIRY LAST YEAR WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH THE INFORMATION THAT HE GOT BACK. BOTH OF THOSE SITUATIONS ARE CLASSIC EXAMPLES OF NGUYEN SOMETHING'S HYPER TECHNICAL RESOURCE DRIVEN AND OUR EFFORTS HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE PAST TO WARRANT AN AUDIT. THIS IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF WHERE IN AUDIT IS MOST APPROPRIATE MY OPINIONS SO I'LL CERTAINLY BE SUPPORTING IT WILL OF COURSE THE WITH THE OUTCOME- BRINGS ABOUT BUT THIS IS REALLY WHAT THIS BOARD IS DESIGNED. ON THIS COMMITTEES DESIGNED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT THANK SENATOR I BELIEVE THE AUDITOR ACTUALLY MENTIONED AS WELL SHE HAS RESOURCES AND CAPACITY TO EVEN BRING IN CONSULTANTS IF SHE NEEDS AT EXPERTISE AS WELL TO CONDUCT THE AUDIT. RIGHT WITH THAT LET ME ASK THERE'S ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS THE DíAS HEARING AND SEEING NONE WE GOT TO MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR ALEX JACKSON ON BEHALF OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO THE PROPOSED AUDIT TODAY LET ME BE CLEAR WHY THOUGH WE ARE CERTAINLY NOT OPPOSED TO TRANSPARENCY. OR RIGOROUS PROGRAM EVALUATION WE HAVE TO KNOW WHAT WE'RE GETTING FOR INVESTMENT DOLLARS. BUT AS WE HEARD THROUGHOUT THE DISCUSSION TODAY ON THE OTHER I REQUEST WE FEEL LIKE THERE'S BEEN A REAL BREAKDOWN IN THE PROCESS WHERE YOU HAVE. THE AGENCY BEING AUDITED GETTING OUR NOTICE A WEEK AGO. A WEEK AGO AND AS A RESULT WE'RE LEFT WITH THE SCOPE THAT WERE CONCERNED IS NOT GOING TO PRODUCE. A AN AUDIT THAT'S GONNA MATERIALLY IMPROVE THESE PROGRAMS MOVING FORWARD BECAUSE IT CLEARLY DOESN'T INCLUDE A HUGE PART OF THEIR BEES MANDATE RELATED TO REDUCING TOXIC AND CRITERIA MISSIONS. IF WE HAD HAD THAT PROPER NOTICE WHICH WAS USED BY MEMBERS ON THIS DíAS TO. YOU KNOW HOW THEY WERE EVALUATING OTHER REQUESTS WE COULD HAVE PRODUCED A MORE RELEVANT INQUIRY WE COULD GIVEN THE AGENCY A CHANCE TO RESPOND. EL AND WE THINK THAT WOULD BE WARRANTED MOVING FORWARD WE ALSO ARE CONCERNED THAT THE NATURE OF THE INQUIRY. AS SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO BE. AS YOU NOTED SENATOR BOARD YES. TECHNICAL AND REQUIRES FOLKS WITH EXPERTISE IN AND TRANSPORTATION POLICY- AND WE ARE WORRIED THAT ADDING THIS REQUEST IN ITS CURRENT SCOPE IT'S GONNA TAKE TIME AND RESOURCES AWAY FROM THE AGENCY. WHO DESPERATELY NEED TO BE FOCUSED ON THE URGENT MISSION OF REDUCING TRANSPORTATION POLLUTION- AT A MINIMUM WE THINK THE- BEAR THE BURDEN OF ESTABLISHING THERE HASN'T BEEN RESPONSIVENESS THAT THERE'S AN ISSUE HAS A BIT MATT. AND AS THE FOR THAT REASON WE OPPOSE THIS REQUEST. THANK YOU IN ALL FAIRNESS YOU KNOW THESE ARE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP YEAR AFTER YEAR. PLEASE ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT. CATHERINE PHILLIPS WAS SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA INDEED THIS. AUDT REQUESTS IS UP FOR ESSENTIALLY THE SECOND YEAR IN A ROW AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE CALIFORNIA RESOURCES BOARD GROUP. LAST YEAR THIS BODY DECIDED NOT TO GO FORWARD WITH AN AUDIT BUT INSTEAD DID AND- A DIRECT CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE CHAIR AND- AND THE- BOARD. AND IT SEEMS THAT. DESPITE THAT WERE COMING BACK NOW WITH THIS AUDIT REQUEST AGAIN. AND THE EFFECT OF THIS IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO IF WE GO FORWARD WITH THIS AUDIT REQUEST WITH LIGHT WHICH I. I MISSED HOW LONG MISS HOWELL SAID IT WOULD TAKE BUT I'M- GONNA GUESS IT'S GONNA TAKE A LOT LONGER. THAN SHE EVEN ESTIMATES BECAUSE THE BREADTH OF THIS AUDIT REQUEST. IS OF FAIRLY INCREDIBLE. THIRTY FOUR TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS. THIRTY FOUR PROGRAMS YOU'RE GONNA LOOK AT WHAT THE GHG IMPACTS COSTS AND BENEFITS ARE FOR EACH OF THOSE PROGRAMS. MANY MANY OF THOSE PROGRAMS. HAVE NOTHING TO WERE NOT INTENDED TO INITIALLY ADDRESS GHGS THEIR ATTENDED TO PROVIDE. PUBLIC YOU KNOW TO GO AFTER CRITERIA POLLUTANTS. TO THAT IMPACT PUBLIC HEALTH. SO FIGURING OUT WHAT THE GHG BENEFITS IT'S A CO BENEFIT IS GOING TO BE PRETTY TECHNICALLY DIFFICULT- FOR AN AUDIT BUREAU. UNLESS YOU'RE BRINGING IN ENGINEERS AND AS AS WAS ALLUDED TO BY OF THE PREVIOUS TESTIFY ARE. BRINGING IN PEOPLE WHO ARE- VERY SKILLED AT- PUBLIC POLICY AT THE TRANSPORTATION POLICY. BUT I'D LIKE TO NOTE SOMETHING ELSE. RIGHT NOW. THIS IS MINUTES THIS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. IS SPENDING AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME. IN OF IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY TE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY AND THE AND CERTAIN AUTOMAKERS THEY'RE SPENDING A LOT OF TIME GOING AFTER CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY TO CONTROL AIR POLLUTION FROM VEHICLES. AND THE WAIVER THAT ALLOWS THIS. STATE THE CONTROL IS HERE POLLUTION TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH IS BEING CHALLENGED. AND MY CONCERN IS THAT ONCE MORE WE'RE GOING TO BE PUT INTO A LEGISLATIVE BODY WILL BE SAYING PUBLICLY WE DON'T TRUST. WE DON'T TRUST THE AGENCY THAT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR CONTROLLING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM TRANSPORTATION. I WOULD BEG YOU TO NOT DO THIS THIS YEAR. DON'T GIVE DONALD TRUMP ANOTHER TALKING POINT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU WILL BE DOING. AND THIS IS NOT THE YEAR TO DO THIS KIND OF AUDIT THE AUDIT IS FAR TOO BROAD AND ONE MORE THING. I WANT TO COMMENT ON THE CONCERN ABOUT THE ABILITY TO FIND INFORMATION I'M ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT GOES IN AND USES CARBS WEBSITE ON A REGULAR BASIS. WE GIVE IT IS CANCER OVER IT IS COMPLEX IT IS CLUMSY. AND I'M I'M HAPPY TO HEAR THAT THEY'RE GOING TO IMPROVE IT BUT THAT BEING SAID IF YOU SPEND THE TIME YOU CAN ULTIMATELY FIND THE ANSWER TO MOST OF THE QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED TODAY. M. MR WHAT I'D LOOK DOCTOR WHAT I'D LOVE TO COME IN AND TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR DISTRICT BECAUSE I THINK I THINK THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT WE SHARE IN COMMON IN OUR CONCERNS ABOUT- THE ABILITY OF YOUR DISTRICT TO GET ACCESS TO CERTAIN KINDS OF FUNDS. THE THANK YOU THANK YOU LET ME ASK THERE'S ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT AT THIS TIME HEARING AND SEEING NON- I DO BELIEVE PROBABLY MEMBERS ON THIS DíAS- DON'T SHARE THE SAME INTERPRETATION AND IN REGARDS TO THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. AND THE OUT A REQUEST AT THIS TIME MISTER BRADFORD IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BY THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND I THINK BASED ON WHAT WE'VE HEARD. THIS AGAIN IS AUDIT THAT'S WALL OVERDUE BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY DESERVING- WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE COMPLEX ISSUES THAT CARP HAS DEALT WET BUT PART OF THE PROBLEM THAT OF PART OF THE CONFUSION IS THE CONSTANT MOVING OF THE GOAL POST ON. WHAT OUR GOALS ARE OR WHAT THEIR GOALS AND OBJECTIVES ARE TO SAY THAT THIS IS GONNA HAND- WASHINGTON A WIN AND I. TEND TO DISAGREE WITH THIS IF ALL WHAT CARNOSINE IT'S TRUE. AND THEY'RE DOING ALL THESE FANTASTIC GROUND IN JUST A- FOR THE- THIS AUDIT WILL SPELL THIS OUT ANY TO HELP BUTTRESS UP THAT WHAT YOU WERE DOING. AND HELP PUSH BACK ON THE CRAZY PROGRAMS THAT WERE SEEN FROM WASHINGTON DC OR THE STOP GAP MEASURES THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO PUT FORTH. SO AUDIT HELPS CONTINUE THE GREAT WORK THAT THIS AGENCY CLAIMS TO BE DOING BUT AGAIN I WANT TO SPEAK TO WHAT. ASSEMBLYMAN WOULD STATED ABOUT. LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AN IMPACT TO COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT MONOLITHIC THEY DON'T LOOK ALIKE. AT I AM REALLY TIRED OF CARP TALKING ABOUT LOW INCOME PEOPLE WHEN VERY FEW OF THOSE PROGRAMS EVER REACHED THOSE COMMUNITIES REGARDLESS OF WHERE THE MONEY IS BEING SPENT. AND I TOO WAS AT A CONFERENCE AND WE HEARD THE DIRECTOR STATE THAT. LOW INCOME PEOPLE WANT ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. LOW INCOME PEOPLE WANT CLEAN AIR THEY WANT CLEAN WATER THEY WANT CLING SOIL BUT I'VE YET TO HEAR ONE SAY I WANTED ZERO EMISSION. VEHICLE THEY SAID I WANT A JOB SO IF THAT IS WHAT THOSE PEOPLE WERE SEEING WERE IS THE DATA FROM THOSE SURVEYS THAT SAY THIS IS WHAT LOW INCOME PEOPLE WANT BECAUSE I'VE YET TO HEAR. NOT ONE LOW INCOME PERSONS AB ONE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE. I'VE HEARD LOW INCOME FOLKS IN THE REASON I DRIVE MY TWENTY YEAR OLD FORD EXPLORERS BECAUSE I CAN'T FIT MY FAMILY A SIX IN THERE AND I CAN'T AFFORD TO US ALL. AND THEY WON'T FIT INTO A PRIUS. SO CONTINUE TO USE POOR PEOPLE AS WHY WE DO A LOT OF THESE PROGRAMS BUT AGAIN THEY DO NOT DIRECTLY SEE THE BENEFITS OF THESE PROGRAMS. I THINK THE AUDIT WILL X. EXPOSED ALL OF THAT. AND I THINK THIS AUDIT ONLY FURTHERS. JUSTIFIES THE WORK THE CARBS DOING BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THE WORK THAT IS LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN DOING I THINK IT'S A COMMONSENSE MEASURE I THINK IT'S LONG OVERDUE BECAUSE AGAIN AT. THE INFORMATION THE CARPETS. I HAVE PUT PUTS OUT BE IT ON THEIR WEBSITE IS PEACE MILLET BASS IS SCATTERED IT'S NOT COMPREHENSIVE. AND AS MY COLLEAGUE STATED YOU ALMOST HAVE TO BE A SCIENTIST TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHICH YOU DO MAKE AVAILABLE SO. THE ARROGANCE OF THIS AGENCY TO ME IT IS JUST SAYING NO IS LONG OVERDUE I AM NOT THE FIRST MEMBER TO ASK FOR THIS AUDIT I WON'T BE THE LAST. AND I THINK IT'S TIMES COMES OUT RESPECT LAST RIVAL. THANK YOU SENATOR BRADFORD- BUT LET ME JUST MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS BEFORE WE MAKE THE MOTION- FIRST THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS AUDIT OBVIOUSLY WE- WE'RE LOOKING AT SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND THESE ARE NOT ISSUES THAT ARE DUE TO THE LEGISLATURE EVEN TO THIS COMMITTEE- WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT AN AGENCY THAT'S BEEN AROUND EVELYN BEST COURSE IT FOR FIFTY PLUS YEARS. HAS NEVER HAD A COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT OF THE TWO POINT TWO BILLION PLUS DOLLARS THAT. HAVE BEEN SPENT I DO APPRECIATE THAT IN YOUR LETTER YOU DO TALK ABOUT BUILDING OFF OF WHAT THE LA JOH. RELEASED IN AND THEIR REPORT AND THEN LOOKING AT THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS AND TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS PARTICULARLY FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. THOSE HEAVILY BURDENED COMMUNITIES WHEREVER THEY EXIST WHETHER THEY EXIST UP. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CENTRAL CALIFORNIA SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- THESE ARE ISSUES THAT- WE HOPE THE OUTER CAN SHED SOME LIGHT ON IN TERMS OF. HOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD- COST EFFECTIVELY BUT WHICH PROGRAMS ARE EVEN WORKING AT CARVE THAT WE CAN. PERHAPS A REPLICATED OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE OF THE ART. HAVING THE TARGETED RESULTS THAT WERE LOOKING FOR SO WITH THAT I'LL ASK FOR A MOTION ON CENTER BRADFORD'S- AUDIT. SECOND MOVE BY ASSEMBLY WOMAN RUBIO SECOND BY MISTER WOOD. MISTER SECTOR KALRA.

NUMBER ELEVEN TWENTY TWENTY DASH ONE OH FOUR CALIBRATE COLLEGE ASSEMBLYMEMBER NEED SOMEONE EVER MEDINA WHEN YOU'RE READY TO BEGIN PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT AND FOR THIS MEETING. I ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUES ASSEMBLY MEMBER- QUIRK SILVA AND SENATOR WIENER SUBMITTED A LETTER TO RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT THIS COMMITTEE APPROVED AN AUDIT THE CALIFORNIA ONLINE COLLEGE WHICH IS ALSO KNOWN AS CAL BRIGHT COLLEGE. CALIBRATE COLLEGE WAS DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED UNDER THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION. THROUGHOUT ITS DEVELOPMENT MY COLLEAGUES IN THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE VOICE SEVERAL CONCERNS ABOUT THE STRUCTURE AND PROGRAMMING. MY COLLEAGUES AND I HOPE THAT THIS AUDIT REQUESTS CAN ACCOMPLISH SEVERAL THINGS. FIRST WE WOULD LIKE THE ADDED TO REVIEW THE CURRENT STATUS OF CAB RIDES COLLEGE EFFORTS TO MEET ITS GOAL OF PROVIDING ECONOMIC MOBILITY. FOR WORKING ADULTS WHO LACK EASY ACCESS FOR TRADITIONAL FORMS OF HIGHER EDUCATION. SECOND WE WOULD LIKE THE IDEA TO REVIEW THE STATUS OF KEY MILESTONES SUCH ACCREDITATION. AS WELL AS EXPENDITURES OF APPROPRIATED FUNDS TO ENSURE THE COB RIGHT COLLEGES PROGRESSIVELY EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY MEETING ITS GOAL. FINALLY WOULD LIKE THE AUDITOR TO REVIEW THE REVISED APPROACH BEING PROPOSED BY THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AS IT RELATES FIRST TO THE ACCREDITATION PATH. SECOND TO COLLABORATION WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THIRD DEFICIENCY OF INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF SCALINGUP ADULTS TOO MANY IMMEDIATELY ENTER THE WORKFORCE. AS THE CHAIR OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND A FORMER EDUCATOR I AM COMMITTED TO ENSURING ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION. HOWEVER WE MUST ENSURE THAT STATE INSTITUTIONS AND PROGRAMS CREATED TO PROMOTE ACCESS ARE IN FACT ACHIEVING THESE GOALS. THIS IS DONE IN A COLLABORATIVE WAY AND THE STUDENTS ARE SUCCESSFUL. WE HOPE THAT THE STATE AUDITOR FINDS THAT THE STAFF WAS SPENT OF THE CUP RIGHT COLLEGE IS PROCEEDING IN AN EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT MANNER. IF CHANGES ARE NEEDED WE BELIEVE THAT IS BEST TO IDENTIFY. THESE CHANGES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. WITH ME HERE TODAY IS JIM MAILER PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS. COMMUNITY COLLEGE COUNCIL AND CARLOS TURNER CORTEZ PRESIDENT OF SAN DIEGO CONTINUING EDUCATION. THANK THANKFUL FOR THEM JOINING ME AND THEY WILL BE ON HAND TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS GREAT THANK YOU YOU HAVE TESTIMONY AS WELL OKAY IF YOU HAVE LIMITED TO TWO MINUTES SIR. I'M JIM MILLER PRESIDENT OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE COUNCIL OF THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS HOPEFULLY THIS AUDIT REQUESTS WILL BE LESS CONTENTIOUS AND SOME OF THE PREVIOUS ONES- I THINK IT'S VERY TIMELY THAT WE ARE HAVING THIS SITE REQUEST IN THAT AND I HOPEFULLY THAT THE COMMITTEE WILL. VOTE TO PERFORM THE AUDIT- IT COULD BE MORE OF A BETTER SPEND THAT AUDIT I THINK IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE FEEL TAXPAYERS ARE CURRENTLY- ON THE HOOK FOR AND I THINK THE STATE IS MISS SPENDING QUITE FRANKLY- WITH RESPECT TO FUNDING CALIBRATE IF YOU LOOK AT THE FUNDING. PER FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENT FOR CAL BRIGHT AND THIS IS NOT AN EXAGGERATION I TEACH MATH SAN DIEGO CITY COLLEGE WHEN I'M NOT DOING THIS JOB- THEY'RE BEING FUNDED AT A RATE OF ONE THOUSAND TIMES WHAT THE RIVER COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE GETTING FOR. OUR TRADITIONAL COLLEGE AND A SITTING THE BACK OF THE ROOM LOOK AT THE OTHER OUT OF YOUR I JUST DID QUICK OUT THE AMOUNT WERE FUNDING FOR CALIBRATED AN ON GOING BASIS EACH YEAR WHAT FUND THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT OF ALL OF THE ODD IT'S BEEN REQUESTED TODAY'S DOCKET SO YOU COULD FIND FORTY EIGHT AUDIT REQUESTS THAT THE AMOUNT OF. FUNDING WE'RE FIGHTING. FOR THIRTY EIGHT. COSTS COULD STUDENTS. IN CALGARY NOW SO. IT'S QUITE BOGGLING IN THE AMOUNT EVERY. IT'S BEING SPENT THE SERVER SO FEW STUDENTS- DUPLICATION IS ANOTHER BIG ISSUE THERE ARE THREE PROGRAMS BEING OFFERED AND CAL BRIGHT ALL THREE OF THOSE PROGRAMS WE CURRENTLY OFFER IN FIFTY ONE DIFFERENT COMMUNITY COLLEGES- SO THERE'S- THERE'S NOT REALLY A NEED TO. REPLICATE THOSE DESPITE CAL BRIGHTS CLAIMS THAT THEY'RE NOT BE A DUPLICATE OF. THEIR EXTRA EXTREMELY DUPLICATIVE WHAT WERE ALREADY OFFERING. ANOTHER MAJOR ISSUE THAT I HOPE THE IF THE AUDITOR WILL FOCUS ON IS THE ACCREDITATION STATUS. ALL HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN COLLEGES IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM ARE ACCREDITED BY ONE AGENCY. THE ACC J. C. AND THAT PROVIDE THOSE STUDENTS TO TAKE COLLEGE COURSES TO. TRANSFER GET FINANCIAL AID IT CETERA CALIBRATE IS NOT ACCREDITED NOT ONLY THAT THEY'RE SEEKING ACCREDITATION. FROM AN OUTSIDE ENTITY THAT'S NOT A TO SEE JC- BECAUSE IT'S BASICALLY A LOWER BAR TO PASS BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO HELP OUR STUDENTS. IF THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL AT THAT ACCREDITATION. LASTLY ON THAT POINT IN ORDER TO PROVIDE MEANINGFUL DISTANCE EDUCATION. THERE HAS TO BE REGULAR AND SUBSTANTIVE CONTACT BETWEEN STUDENT AND TEACHER THAT'S NOT HAPPENING AT CAL BRIGHT THE STUDENTS ARE. DOING NOW PRETTY MUCH OFF THE SHELF COURSES LEARN AS YOU GO KIND OF THINGS. AND YOUR GIVE ME THE I. LIKE I'M OUT OF TIME YOU ARE. I THANK GOD AND I LEADERS QUITE THAT WAS HIS BABY ARISE. FROM THAT COMMENT AS WELL THANK YOU ESTATE. IF YOU MAY BEGIN WITH YOUR PRESENT. RIGHT GIVEN ADDITIONAL PERSON TO GET LEASE WE CAN. CARLIST COURT TO PRESS SAN DIEGO CONTINUING A- OF AN EDUCATOR FOR TWENTY YEARS A CEO FOR OVER TEN YEARS. I'VE BEEN AT THE HELM OF SAN DIEGO CONTINUING EDUCATION A LARGEST ADULT NOT CREDIT ORGANIZATION. IN THE STATE SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN I WAS APPOINTED TO THE FLOW COMMITTEE. AT THAT TIME I DISCLOSE THAT CYNICAL CONTINUING EDUCATION HAD BEEN IN THE PROCESS FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS OF DEVELOPING A FULLY ONLINE EDUCATIONAL. INSTITUTION THAT WOULD HAVE MET THE GOVERNOR'S REQUEST I SHOULD STATE THAT I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE. OF FORMER GOVERNOR BROWN'S REQUEST TO EXPAND DISTANCE EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES JUST NOT HOW IT WAS OPERATIONALIZED BY OUR SYSTEMS LEADERSHIP- I WAS ON THE FLOW COMMITTEE I BROUGHT FOR THE ONLY PROPOSAL TO CREATE A FULLY ONLINE ORGANIZATION. AND THAT PROPOSAL WAS NOT ACKNOWLEDGED NOT AT THAT TIME I DID SHARE THAT WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF LAUNCHING A WE WILL LAUNCH THIS SUMMER. THE INTERACTIVE COMPETENCY BASED ONLINE MICHAEL CREDENTIALING A CAT ACADEMY- IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY WHICH WILL PROVIDE. FULLY ONLINE DISTANCE EDUCATION ADULT EDUCATION CERTIFICATES. THESE PROGRAMS ARE DUPLICATIVE OF PROGRAMS OF THE CURRENT PROGRAMS OFFERED BY CULPRIT ARE DUPLICATIVE OF THOSE IN PLACE. ON THERE ALSO CHARGING THAT THE NEED FOR CAL BRIGHT IS A NEW COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION WHICH WE ALREADY DO WOULD NOT CREDIT EDUCATION. THE KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OUR APPROACH AND THE CALIBER TO APPROACH FIRST IS THE ROLE OF FACULTY FACULTY ARE INVOLVED FROM THE OUTSET AND DEVELOPING THE CURRICULUM. AND DESIGNING THE PROGRAM AS THEY SHOULD BE. SECOND IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FACULTY AND STUDENT THERE WAS REQUIRED SICKNESS FACE TO FACE INSTRUCTION WHICH DOES NOT OCCUR IN THE COUNTERPART ORGANIZATION. AS WELL AS THE REQUIREMENT PER STUDENT THIS. TO COLLABORATION REQUIRE COLLAB WORK IN STUDENTS TO ME ALL. OF TIME WEEK TO FACE AS WELL MOST IMPORTANTLY I SHOULD STATE. THAT THE COST OF LAUNCHING I COME ACADEMY IS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS LESS THAN 1% AND I REITERATE. THAN 1% OF THE INVESTMENT PUT IN CALPERS. WE COULD DO A LOT MORE TO. COME TO SUPPORT STUDENTS. PORT THE EXPANSION IT IS THAT YOU CATION BY REINVEST THAT FUNDING IN EXISTING DISTRICTS THAT ARE. AIMING TO EXPAND DISTANCE EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES. FOR THEIR STUDENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH I ALSO OVER THE STATE OUT OF PRESIDENT PLEASE YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR VERY QUICKLY. AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER. INTO LOOKING AT CAP RIGHT. FIRST OF GIVE IS ASKING A TO I BY. STUDENTS IN. IN THE OFFER AND VARIOUS PER. THAT ARE OF THROUGH CAL BREAK ASKING US FOR SOME DEMO. AND REAL ARE RELATED TO ETHNIC DIVERSITY AGE INCOME THEIR REASONS FOR ENROLLING DID THEY HAVE OTHER OPTIONS OR WAS THIS THEIR BEST OPTION. ALSO WHETHER OR NOT THE STUDENTS ARE ACTUALLY PROGRESSING AND IN THE VARIOUS COURSES AND PROGRAMS. WITH RESPECT TO THERE ARE CERTAIN KEY MILESTONES AND THE ACT IT'S CALLED THE CALIFORNIA ONLINE COMMUTER COLLEGE ACT. ON AND HE'S ASKING US TO EVALUATE THEIR EFFORTS IN ACHIEVING THOSE KEY MILESTONES THAT FIRST ONE IS ACCREDITATION. ON THE SECOND ONE IS RELATED TO FACILITATING INTERNSHIPS AND JOB PLACEMENTS WORKING WITH EMPLOYERS AND INDUSTRY GROUPS. TO GET THE STUDENTS OPPORTUNITIES TO SERVE IN AN INTERNSHIP WHICH HOPEFULLY TRANSLATES INTO A JOB. ALSO ARE THEY ARE PREPARING TO RECEIVE AND EDUCATE STUDENTS WHO ARE THEY RECRUITING FACULTY. ARE AND QUALIFIED FACULTY TO SERVE THE STUDENTS- THE OTHER. OBJECTIVES ARE RELATED TO OUTREACH- WHAT EFFORTS HAVE THEY- ARE ENGAGED IN TO REACH OUT TO THE TYPES OF STUDENTS THAT THIS. TYPE OF ONLINE OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE WAS INTENDED TO SERVE ARE THEY MEETING THEIR ENROLLMENT GOALS- ALSO- WITH RESPECT TO DUPLICATION. HE'S ASKED US TO LOOK AT THEIR PROGRAMS AND COURSES AND COMPARE THOSE TO A SELECTION OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE ONLINE. PROGRAMS AND DETERMINE THERE ARE NOT THEY ARE IN FACT CLICK IF. AND THE FINAL CUT OF. CAR YOU CAN SHOW THAT. ALBRIGHT COLLEGE IS COMPLY WITH LAWS IN RAGS WITH RESPECT EMPLOYMENT PER TO THE TIP THINGS AS A AND THAT'S UP AND THEN THE EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF HOW THEY'RE USING THEIR RESOURCES- AND COMPARING THAT THE ONLINE PROGRAMS THAT CALIBRATE HAS TWO OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN CALIFORNIA AND THEN FINALLY LOOKING AT A SAMPLE OR SELECTION OF SOME EXPENDITURES FOR REASONABLE NESS AND APPROPRIATENESS THE USE OF THOSE FUNDS- THE BUDGET TO START IT'S ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED HOURS AGAIN THAT'S ABOUT A SEVEN MONTH THOUGHT IT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU AT THIS TIME OF GOING TO MOVE TO THE AFFECTED AGENCIES. THE. GOOD AFTERNOON. CHAIRMAN SALAS INVASIVE AT CHRISTMAS ROTH IS IN HERE MET UP MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- LEASE THAT STATE YOUR NAME I AM ALSO FOR THAT'S MY NEXT LINE THANK.

BUT WE WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THIS REQUEST FOR NOT OF CAL AND EXPLAIN THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE SO FAR. WE SHARE THE DESIRE OF ASSEMBLYMAN MEMBER MEDINA TO ENSURE THE CAB RIGHT IS OPERATING IN AN EFFECTIVE AND TRANSPARENT MANNER WE WELCOME YOUR SUGGESTIONS ABOUT HOW WE CAN BETTER ACHIEVE OUR MISSION OR IMPROVE OUR METHODS. RESPECTFULLY THOUGH WE FEEL AN AUDIT IS PREMATURE AND ITS SCOPE COVERS MANY AREAS WHICH CALIBRATED STILL DEVELOPING AND TESTING AS A RESULT WE GOT WE'RE CRESCENT OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATORS TO ASK FOR THE AUDIT. TO MODIFY ITS TIMING AND SCOPE. WE'RE STILL IN THE VERY EARLY STAGES OF LAUNCHING THIS COLLEGE CABARET WAS ANNOUNCED TO THE PUBLIC ONLY LAST MAN BEGAN ACCEPTING APPLICANTS FOR ADMISSION IN OCTOBER. WE HAVE ONLY FOR ME FORTY PERMANENT EMPLOYEES AND OF SPENT A SMALL FRACTION OF OUR INITIAL ALLOCATION. WE ARE PLEASED THAT MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS AND HAVE ENROLLED AND LET ME JUST- RESPOND TO ONE OF THE COMMENTS EARLIER THE NOTION THAT WE'RE SPENDING A THOUSAND TIMES MORE PER STUDENT IS REALLY NOT CREDIBLE GIVEN.

THE GOAL OF THE PROGRAM IS TO PROGRAMS TO HELP INDIVIDUALS MEET REMAIN IN THEIR HOME AND PREVENT MORE COSTLY INSTITUTIONALIZATION HOWEVER IT IS ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THERE'S A SORT SHORTAGE OF PROVIDERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WITH THE PROBLEM BEING MORE CUTE CONCERNED COUNTIES SOME HAVE ATTRIBUTED THE PROBLEM TO THE LESS COMPETITIVE WAGE BEING OFFERED AND THE LACK OF BENEFITS OF A JUMBO PROVIDERS.

HELLO MY NAME IS HANA CARBALLO I'VE BEEN IN AYE HSS PROVIDER FOR ALMOST FORTY YEARS I WORK FOR NON FAMILY MEMBERS. THIS IS MY CAREER THIS IS MY CALLING THIS IS MY LIFE. AND I AM NOT GOING ANYWHERE I'M HERE IN FRONT OF YOU AS I HAVE BEEN IN FRONT OF LEGISLATIVE BODY SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX ADVOCATING FOR HIGHER WAGES FOR AYE HSS WORKERS. I HAVE SEVERAL STORIES TO TELL YOU WHEN I WILL TAKE MY FULL TWO MINUTES THANK YOU. FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT MY OWN PERSONAL HOUSING STORY WHICH IS THAT IN THE SUMMER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN I LOST MY HOUSE RIGHT RENTAL HOME DUE TO AN OWNER MOVE IN EVICTION I LIVE IN BERKELEY CALIFORNIA RENTS ARE VERY HIGH. MY FAMILY COULD NOT AFFORD TO GET A NEW HOME IN CALIFORNIA AND THE BAY AREA MY DAUGHTER WAS GRADUATING HIGH SCHOOL WENT TO COLLEGE. SHE HAS HER COLLEGE TUITION PAID FOR AND HER HOUSING THANK GOODNESS SHE'S A VERY BRIGHT GIRL AND SHE'S GOT SCHOLARSHIP. MY PARTNER. IS NOT WORKING BECAUSE HE WAS TO SAVE.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS- I'M JUST HERE IN SUPPORT OF TWO REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE CITY OF LONDON I'LL JUST GO AHEAD AND HAD THE MIKE OVER TO THEM TO THE OPTION TO SPEAK PERHAPS BEFORE WE GIVE IT TO THAT WE CAN HAVE THE STATE AUDITOR- GIVE A PRESENTATION ON THE CITY OF WHIMSY CERTAINLY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN HER AND HANDED OVER TO MR CHILDREN BUT THIS IS ONE OF THE ARTISTS THAT WE REQUESTED- AUTHORITY TO. CONDUCT AFTER WE CONDUCTED AN ASSESSMENT WE WENT OUT TO THE CITY OF LINDSAY SPENT A COUPLE OF WEEKS MEETING WITH OFFICIALS LOOKING AT SOME DOCUMENTS ARE CONDUCTED THE ASSESSMENT. THE WAY OUR PROCESS WORKS IS WE DO GIVE THE ENTITY THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO OUR ASSESSMENT THAT IS INCLUDED IN THE MATERIALS THAT WE SHARED WITH THE MEMBERS WHAT I'D LIKE MISTER CHILDREN TO DO AND A VERY HIGH LEVEL AND HE'S PREPARED TO DO THAT WILL KEEP IT HIGH LEVEL WHAT THE KEY ISSUES WORK THAT WE IDENTIFIED AND WHY WE STILL BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR. THIS COMMITTEE TO APPROVE NOT IT THANK YOU THANK YOU. A GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE RECORD MY NAME IS. STILL NOT. PARTNER SO IS MISS HOW INDICATED WE ANALYZE THE CITY LYNSEY'S FINANCES WHEN WE ISSUED OUR DASHBOARD AND WE DETERMINED THAT THEY WERE THE FOURTH. MOST FISCALLY CHALLENGED CITY IN THE STATE AND ESSENTIALLY THAT WAS BECAUSE- THEY ARE HAVING DIFFICULTIES IN TERMS OF THEIR CASH POSITION AND RESERVE TO PAY THEIR BILLS. AND THEY ALSO HAVE INCREASING RETIREMENT COSTS. SO WHAT'S GOING ON THERE IS THEY'VE BASICALLY BEEN INCURRING- REGULAR OPERATING LOSSES AND SEVERAL OF THEIR FOR. ANOTHER ISSUE THAT THEY- IS THAT THE GENERAL FUND HAS LOAN SAID STANGEL AMOUNTS OF MONEY TO OTHER FUNDS INCLUDING SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. TO ANOTHER FUND TO BUILD AN INDOOR SPORTS COMPLEX. BECAUSE THAT COMPLEX DIDN'T GENERATE ENOUGH REVENUE TO BASICALLY TO PAY THE LOAN OFF. CITY COUNCIL FOR GAVE THAT LOAN WHICH RESULT IN A PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL HIT THE GENERAL FUND. BECAUSE OF THAT AT THE OPERATING LOSSES THE LOANS THAT WERE WRITTEN OFF. THE CITY WHEN'S THE GENERAL HAS A VERY SIGNIFICANT DEFICIT. GENERAL RESERVES. I AND FROM WE TO THE DASHBOARD THE CITY OF LINDSEY'S. NEGATIVE FIVE. GENERAL FUND RESERVE WAS THE SECOND LARGEST IN. THE ENTIRE STATE AT NINE POINT FOUR MILLION. BECAUSE OF THE ISSUES THIS THESE EXTERNAL HAS A- GOING. ABOUT AND BASICALLY HAS SAID THE CITY HAS SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE CITY'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. IN THE MOST RECENT AUTO REPORT THE ORDER WENT SO FAR AS TO CALL THE CITY FUNCTIONALLY BANKRUPT- SO WE HAVE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT- AUDIT OBJECTIVES BUT TO KEEP IT BRIEF ESSENTIALLY IF THE AUDIT IS APPROVED- THAT WOULD GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO A DEEPER DIVE AND REALLY- PUT TOGETHER A FULL ACCOUNTING OF THE CITY'S FINANCIAL OPERATIONAL MANAGEMENT RISKS. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY WE GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE DETAILED AND PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE CITY THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO CREATE A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN ESSENTIALLY TO ADDRESS THE FINDINGS. AND WE HAVE ESTIMATED THAT THE ART IT WOULD TAKE ABOUT ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED NINETY SIX HOURS TO COMPLETE. AND THAT WOULD EQUATE TO ROUGHLY FOUR FIVE MONTHS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. OKAY THAT GETS US TO THE AFFECTED CITIES A MEASURE REPORT YOUR AND YOU HAVE ANY MORE TO ADD TO THE REPORT NO NO THANK YOU OKAY WELCOME CITY OF ANTI. YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN NAME IS PAM CAMPBELLI'M MAYOR OF THE CITY LINDSEY AND- WELCOME THIS OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TO YOURSELF AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONCERN ABOUT OUR FINANCES. AS A SMALL VERY DISADVANTAGED. OF AG BASED COMMUNITY WE HAVE BUILT MOSTLY ALONE AND- DEALING WITH OUR WITH OUR DEEP CHALLENGES. AND THEY'VE GONE BACK FOR DECADES- WE ARE IN THE CITRUS SPELLED WE FACED A NUMBER OF DEVASTATING FREEZES WE'VE HAD BUSINESSES CLOSE AND LEAVE WE- ARE POPULATION IS PRIMARILY- HISPANIC FARM WORKER. WE HAVE LOW GROWTH THERE'S A FEW WAYS TO RAISE FUNDS IN OUR IN OUR COMMUNITY BUT- WE DON'T THINK OUR STRUGGLES ARE THAT UNIQUE TO US THEIR SHARED BY MOST CITIES IN OUR AREA WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE FACT THAT WE DID. HAVE A MAJOR EFFORT UNDERTAKEN TO TRY TO RISE ABOVE OUR POVERTY. ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS AGO IN CREATING THIS. REGIONAL SPORTS AND RECREATION FACILITY IN AN OLD ABANDONED PACKING HOMES. AND AT THE SAME TIME WE DID DOWNTOWN IMPROVEMENTS TRYING TO INVITE. PEOPLE BACK INTO OUR COMMUNITY- FOR VARIOUS REASONS THIS MAJOR EFFORT. WAS DID FAIL- SOME OF THEM ARE CALDERON WEAKNESSES AND SOME OF THEM WERE THINGS LIKE THE GREAT RECESSION THAT HIT OUR AREA VERY HARD AND WE WERE A LONG TIME CLIMBING OUT OF. OF THE RE SENDING A REDEVELOPMENT WHICH WE HAD RELIED UPON AND THINGS LIKE THAT THAT WERE SOMEONE OUT OF OUR CONTROL BUT IT LEFT US WITH A BIG HOLE ULTIMATELY- WHICH WE HAVE ADMITTED TO IN OUR GENERAL FUND. AND I BELIEVE MADE THE RIGHT DECISION IN. FORGIVING ORLEANS TO OURSELVES SO THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD WE BELIEVE THAT WAS THE RIGHT DECISION WE HAVE OTHER HELLO THAT WE'VE HAD TO. PAY BACK ON SOME GRANTS THAT WERE DEEMED BY THE STATE TO BE. NOT PROPERLY ADMINISTERED AND WE HAVE WORKED THROUGH THOSE ISSUES AS WELL AND MAYES SETTLEMENTS ARE A REALLY CLOSE TO SETTLING WITH. IN AND ALL OF THOSE INSTANCES SO WE FEEL LIKE WE HAVE. TAKEN THE STEPS WE NEED TO CLIMB OUT OF THIS SITUATION WE HAVE MANAGED TO AVOID BANKRUPTCY OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS IT'S BEEN HARD WORK WE'VE DONE. EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE MADE CUTS TO THE BONE WE HAVE RAISED REVENUES THROUGH A ONE CENT SALES TAX THAT WE WERE. SUCCESSFUL IN PASSING. ON BUT WE ARE A POOR COMMUNITY AND THERE'S LIMITS TO REVENUES THAT WE CAN REYES AND THERE'S LIMITS TO SERVICES THAT WE CAN PROVIDE. SO BUT WE FEEL WE MOVED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WE DON'T DISPUTE A LOT OF YOU KNOW THE AUDITOR'S REPORT NECESSARILY BUT WE DO THINK THAT THAT V. I REQUEST LETTER DOES NOT ACCURATELY REFLECT OUR CURRENT SITUATION AND EFFORTS THAT WE HAVE MADE. THE PAST WE THINK WE'VE OVERCOME BUT WE HAVE MANY CONCERNS ABOUT THE FUTURE WE HAVE MANY NEEDS FOR THE FUTURE THAT WE DON'T KNOW HOW WE'RE GOING TO MEET SO WE'RE STILL IN A PRECARIOUS SITUATION. FOR EXAMPLE OUR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE IS A BIG CONCERN FOR US THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED A NEW WATER TREATMENT PLANT FOR EXAMPLE AND WE HAVE NO WAY TO FIND IT- STIGMA IS EVEN A BIG BURDEN WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO. PAY FOR PLANS THAT WILL ULTIMATELY HURT OUR AG ECONOMY AND THOSE ARE ON CITY FINANCES. SO IT'S THINGS LIKE THIS OF DESERT AREA STRUCK THE SHOWING WITH ADEQUATELY STAFFING PUBLIC SAFETY DEPARTMENTS. WE DO THE BEST WE CAN WE OUT OF NECESSITY COMBINED POLICE AND FIRE AND CROSS TRAIN THOSE OFFICERS JUST SO THAT WE COULD HANDLE THESE ISSUES- I MEAN WE WELCOME AT AUDIT IF IT CAN GIVE US ANY ANY IDEAS ON HOW TO DO THINGS BETTER THANK GOD I THINK- THAT'S ONE THING THAT WE HEAR ABOUT AS WELL AS WE FIND BEST PRACTICES. SO THE STATE AUDITOR'S LOOKED AT A NUMBER OF CITIES ALREADY UNDER THE HIGH RISK SO PERHAPS IT. IDEAS THERE THAT MIGHT BENEFIT THE CITY OF LINDSAY AND ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT HAVING AN AUDITOR GOODWIN IS LOOK AT SEE WHAT CITY OF LINDSAY FOR INSTANCE IN THIS CASE IS DOING SAYING OUR FAXES MADE ANOTHER SMALL CITY OR CITY MIGHT ACTUALLY BE ACTUAL SOMETHING MAYBE YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE CONSIDERED OR SOME OTHER FINANCE MECHANISM. HELPED A OUT. SO I THINK THAT'S THE SCOPE AND- IF YOU WANT TO HONOR WE HOPE CAN GET SOME OUT OF WE DO THINK. A YOU FROM NOW. YOU'LL SEE SOME VERY DIFFERENT THINGS BECAUSE WE HAVE PUT A LOT OF THINGS IN PLACE. THANK YOU. ALRGHT LET ME ASK IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS FOR MEMBERS ON THE DíAS CENTER MORLOCK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. MAYOR THANKS FOR COMING. THANK YOU AND YOU SAID IT WAS PAM CAMILLA CAMPBELL CAMPBELL THANK YOU. THERE ARE A FEW CITIES ON OUR AGENDA TODAY- I HAVE REVIEWED YOUR KAFIRS. AND JUST DID A SIMPLE METRIC AND- THE STATE AUDITOR HAS HER OWN DEEP DIVE SHE LOOKS AT ABOUT TEN CRITERIA I ONLY LOOK AT ONE- AND THAT IS YOUR OWN RESTRICTED NEXT POSITION WHICH CURRENTLY IS A DEFICIT- BUT I DIVIDE THAT BY YOUR POPULATION. AND OF THE FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO CITIES- YOUR IN- THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE. THAT'S FOR YOUR RANK TO THE OTHER CITIES AT TODAY THE OTHER FOUR ARE ACTUALLY IN WORSE SHAPE. THAN YOU ARE BASED ON MY METRICS. BLYTH IS AT THREE SEVENTY SIX WEST COVINA IS A. FOUR FOUR FIVE EL SERENO IS A FOUR FIVE FOUR AND THEN GABRIEL IS A FOUR FIVE FIVE. SO WE HAVE A LOT OF CITIES. IN YOUR POSITION AND WORSE AND SO YOU CAN LOOK AT ALL THE OTHER CITIES AND HOW THEY RANK ON MY WEBSITE. BUT IT'S SYSTEMIC OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE STATE AND IT'S BEEN FRUSTRATING FOR ME MISTER CHAIR AS A SENATOR IN THE LEGISLATURE THAT WERE SET NOT TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN THE SURPLUS. IN OUR CITIES HAVE NO WAY OF RAISING REVENUES YOU CAN'T TOUCH THE PROPERTY TAX YOU COULD TRY DO AN ASSESSMENT OR PARTIAL TO ACT YOU CAN DO A SALES TAX INCREASE BUT WE'VE GOT CITIES COMING HERE ASKING TO GO WELL BEYOND THE 2% THAT. WE CAP THE MAT SO- THE DESERT RELISHING TIMES FOR OUR CITIES AND OUR COUNTIES- OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS BUT- I'M JUST CURIOUS AS HOW- HOW MANY OF THESE TYPES OF AUDITS HAVE YOU DONE. HIGHER YEARS FOR CITIES. IN A AND WHAT'S BEEN THE WORK PRODUCT THAT'S BEEN GIVEN TO THE CITY'S. WELL WE'VE AUDITED AT LEAST FOUR OR FIVE CITIES ARE VIA THIS LOCAL HIGH RISK PROGRAM THAT WHERE THAT WE'VE REQUESTED AUTHORITY FROM THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE AS I MENTIONED IN MY OPENING REMARKS THE FIRST TWO WE DID WERE THE CITY OF HAMILTON CITY MAY WOULD. THEN WE ALSO LOOKED AT THE CITY OF MONTEBELLO AND LYNN WORK SO WE AT LEAST FOUR ON MY LAST- AND WE MAKE DIFFERENT TYPES OF RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE CITIES WITH RESPECT TO- OPPORTUNITIES TO RAISE REVENUE AREAS WHERE THEY CAN CUT COSTS- LOOKING FOR EFFICIENCIES HELPING THEM WITH JUST. BASIC MANAGEMENT PRACTICES INTERNAL CONTROLS THE BASIC FUNDAMENTALS ARE AND NO DISRESPECT TO THE C. ANY THE CITY'S JUST GIVING THEM SOME ADVICE FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THE STAFF THE TYPICALLY WORK ON THESE AUDITS LIKE MR CHILDREN ARE FISCAL EXPERTS FROM MY OFFICE WHO EITHER WORK ON THE AUDIT THAT WE DO ON AN ANNUAL BASIS OF THE STATE'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THEIR CPA'S- OR THEY HAVE THAT TYPE OF A BACKGROUND SO WE THINK WE REALLY COULD PROVIDE A SERVICE TO CITIES IN CALIFORNIA AND I THINK IF YOU SPOKE WITH THE CITIES THAT WE'VE AUDITED THUS FAR- NOBODY LOVES TO BE HAUNTED THAT'S FOR SURE I'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR. TWENTY YEARS AS THE STATE AUDITOR AND NOBODY LIKES US CALM BUT I THINK AFTER THE FACT. WE CONDUCT THE WORK THEY THINK FAIR AND REASONABLE AND HAVE BEEN THEM SOME SOME FOOD FOR THOUGHT AS AS THINGS THEY CAN DO TO TRY TO. STRENGTHEN THEIR FISCAL POSITION I'M OPTIMISTIC ALL UP. USING BERMAN ALL G. K. WITH CALL IT AN AUDIT. AB CALL IT MAN COACHING. OR A SYSTEM BECAUSE WE'RE WE'RE NOT SCHOLAR BEING I JUST GIVE YOU AN EXAM MISTER CHAIR I DID THIS PROCESS OF CALLING IN TRYING TO GET KAFIRS FROM COUNTIES WHEN I WAS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD IN TWENTY TWELVE AND I CALLED MODOC AND I SAID YOU'RE KAFFIR IS NOT ON YOUR WEBSITE. COULD YOU HAVE YOUR AUDITOR CONTROLLER CALLED ME BACK AND LET ME KNOW HOW I CAN OBTAIN A COPY AND THE SECRETARY SAID WELL YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE US A TOLL FREE NUMBER. BECAUSE WE DON'T MAKE LONG DISTANCE PHONE CALLS WERE PROHIBITED. IS IT KIND OF GIVES YOU A CLUE OF HOW TIED. THE BUDGET WISE THERE'S LIKE ALL MY GOODNESS SN'T YOU CAN EVEN PUT A PDF ON YOUR WEBSITE. YOU CAN EVEN CALL ME BACK UNLESS THEY GIVE YOU AN EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER- SO THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON MISTER CHAIR. AND SO. WE NEED TO HELP. AND SO I'M WONDERING ARE YOU ALSO GOING TO REVIEW THE MO USE FOR ALL THAT. AB A BARGAINING UNIT NEGOTIATIONS. I DON'T KNOW SENATOR IF THAT IS A SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE ACTIVELY MINISTER TOLD HIM BUT WE DO LOOK AT. THE EXPENDITURES AND AS THE MAYOR INDICATED THIS IS A CITY THAT HAS HAD TO. COMBINED POLICE AND FIRE SO ESSENTIALLY AS WE DESCRIBE IN THE IN THE ANALYSIS. THE POLICE OFFICERS ARE SERVING AS POLICE OFFICERS A FIRE BREAKS OUT THERE SHIFTING GEARS IN THEIR BECOMING. ESSENTIALLY FIREFIGHTERS SO WE WOULD LOOK AT SOME OF THAT. THE CONSTRAINTS THAT THE CITY IS UNDER WE HAVE LOOKED AT THAT SITUATION. IN OTHER CITIES PARTICULARLY SOME OF THE CITIES THAT ARE BEING CONSIDERED TODAY WHERE. THERE HAVE BEEN- SALARY INCREASES AND THERE HASN'T REALLY BEEN A CONSIDERATION AS TO HOW THOSE SALARY INCREASES ARE GOING TO BE PAID FOR. AND WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS ARE WITH RESPECT TO RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND CERTAINLY- PAP. IT'S NOT SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED IN THE OBJECTIVES THAT I CAN SEE QUICKLY- BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE COULD LOOK. ANYWHERE IN THE CITY IT STICK. THAT THAT HELP. IS YOU'RE YOU'RE A GOT A FEW OF THESE ARE. SO AND YOU SHOULD BE DOING THE SAME THING BUT RIGHT. I INTO THOUSAND SIX I WORKED ON. NEGOTIATING WITH OUR BARGAINING UNITS TO ADDRESS OUR RETIREE MEDICAL LIABILITY IT WAS. PRETTY COUNTY TIMES ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN. AND ARE ANYA REQUIRED CONTRIBUTION WAS JUST. LOST SOUL LARGE WAS LIKE TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY. MILLION A YEAR. AND SO WE NEGOTIATED AND WE MADE SOME MINOR CHANGES LIKE INTEGRATE WITH MEDICARE- REDUCE THE COLA IN A FEW. KEY THINGS VERY SIMPLE BUT WE WERE ABLE TO REDUCE THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY BY 71% BY A BILLION DOLLARS. AND IT REDUCED OUR AND REQUIRED CONTRIBUTION DOWN TO LIKE A HUNDRED- IS THE REASON LIKE A HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR. THEY WANT IF PROVIDES BY THE TIME I WAS SUPERVISOR SABLE WE LOSS IN THE BANKRUPTCY DESPITE THAT ONE- OPPORTUNITY. AND SO IT YOU KNOW IF WE CAN PROVIDE THOSE KINDS OF. A BENEFITS WERE YOU CAN SAY HERE'S HERE'S OF YOU CAN ACTUALLY CHANGE- I KNOW YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE PENSION. YOU KNOW THAT WE'VE GOT LAWSUITS IN STATE SUPREME COURT ON THAT BUT- BUT BOY IF WE TO WALK AWAY FROM THESE ASSIGNMENTS WHERE WE WERE ADDED SOME VERY. AND THEN MAYBE WE NEED TO. DO SOME KIND OF PUBLICATION TO ALL THE OTHER CITIES. BECAUSE MISTER CHAIR YEAH I KNOW WHAT THE LIKE ESCONDIDO THEY HAD A THEY HAD A WHOLE WORK STUDY SESSION FOR THEIR CITY COUNCIL AND HOW ARE THEY GOING TO MAKE THEIR PENSION PAYMENT. YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE GOT CITIES. THAT CAME OUT TO CALPERS. WHEN I ASKED FOR JUST SOME. ACTUARIAL DATA AND THEY STARTED GIVING CALPERS FINANCE ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE THE DATES THEY'D RUN OUT OF CASH. AND HOW THEY REDUCE THEIR POLICE DEPARTMENTS IN THEIR FIRE DEPARTMENT. BY GOT A WHOLE STRUCTURE THAT IS OUR SIT THERE ARE SUBSIDIARIES BETTER ARE HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME SO I WOULD MADAM MADAM MAYOR I WOULD LOOK AT THIS AS AN AUDIT I WOULD LOOK AT THIS IS A VERY HELPFUL IF YOU WOULD CALL IT AN AUDIT.

HEARING AND SAYING MAN LET ME ASK IF THE AUTHOR WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE HELLO MR TELL CHILDREN SURE ONE MORE COMMON GETTING BACK TO THE ANIMAL USE WHEN WE WORK ON THE LOCAL HIGH RISK AUDITS WE DO TYPICALLY TAKE A LOOK AT THE BARGAINING UNIT AGREEMENTS. AND THE REASON WE DO THAT IS OBVIOUSLY THE PERSONNEL COSTS THOSE ARE REALLY SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURES FOR ALL THE CITIES. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY HAVE. EMPLOYEES THAT ARE COVERED BY UNIONS WE WANT TO LOOK AT THOSE FAMILY USE AND WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS. THE SALARIES THAT ARE PAID TO THE MISCELLANEOUS EMPLOYEES PUBLIC SAFETY EMPLOYEES IN A PARTICULAR WE'RE LOOKING AT THE PENSION BENEFIT BECAUSE WHAT WE FIND SOME SKIS. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN. HE WAS ACTUALLY MAKING THE EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTION TO PENSION COSTS WE WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT. THE OTHER THING IS THE- THESE HAVE. RETIREMENT FOR WAS SOME CITIES FOR. EVEN FOR MISCELLANEOUS EMPLOYEES IT'S TWO POINT SEVEN AT FIFTY FIVE. FOR OTHERS IT'S TOO AT FIFTY FIVE SO WE ALWAYS LOOK AT THOSE ARGUED AGREEMENTS. BECAUSE THOSE ARE REALLY DRIVING SOME OF THE COSTS THAT WERE SEEN. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU I THINK THAT WAS OUR LOWS. OF WILL OKAY WELL I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THERE WAS A STYLE DRIFTED JUJU DRIFTED FROM YOUR CORE. RESPONSIBILITIES WITH THE SPORTS. CENTER BUT THAT'S PASSED SO NOW WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO.

PLEASE. HI HOW ARE YOU. DOING ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS SAID EXCEPT FOR GERMANY JAPAN CHINA AND THE UNITED STATES ITSELF CALIFORNIA IS A STATE PRODUCES MORE WEALTH THAN EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD YET ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT AT LEAST A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND OF OUR PEOPLE ARE HOMELESS MANY OF THEM VETERANS MANY OF THEM CHILDREN. OF THE FIVE CITIES IN THE COUNTRY WITH THE WORST HOMELESSNESS PROBLEM FOR OUR IN CALIFORNIA IN PEOPLE DIED ON THE STREETS OF LOS ANGELES TWICE AS MANY. AS JUST A FEW YEARS EARLIER. IN HIS STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS GOVERNOR NEW SUMMER RIGHTLY CALLED OUR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS A DISGRACE. AND IT'S GETTING WORSE WELL HOMELESSNESS DECLINED IN MOST STATES OVER THE PAST YEAR THEY WANT MORE THAN 16% IN CALIFORNIA. THAT'S TWENTY THOUSAND MORE CALIFORNIANS WITHOUT A HOME. ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNOR. TOTAL STATE FUNDING ACROSS MULTIPLE AGENCIES HAS GROWN TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN THE PAST TWO YEARS ALONE WITH AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT FOUR BILLION. PROPOSED THIS YEAR. NOW GOVERNOR NEWSOME DESERVES CREDIT FOR FACING THIS CRISIS WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY IT DEMANDS. BUT WE CANNOT WAIT MONEY SPENT WITH PEOPLE HELPED THAT'S NEITHER PRUDENT NOR COMPASSIONATE. A RECENT REPORT BY THE NONPARTISAN LEGISLATIVE ANALYST WARNS THAT NEW FUNDING COULD QUICKLY DISSIPATEWITHOUT% DEMONSTRATING MUCH PROGRESS IT INVESTMENTS ARE MADE WITHOUT A CLEAR PLAN. THE REPORT CONCLUDES THAT WITHOUT DATA AS GUIDEPOSTS SPENDING IS LESS LIKELY TO MAKE A MEANINGFUL ONGOING IMPACT ON THE STATE'S HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. MISTER CHAIR THE GOVERNOR UNDERSTANDS THAT WE NEED TO DO BETTER THAT WE NEED AN EVIDENCE BASED STRATEGY THAT'S WHY HE EXPLICITLY CALLED FOR A COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT IN HIS STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS. IN ADDITION THE GOVERNOR'S HOMELESSNESS TASK FORCE LED BY SACRAMENTO MAYOR DARRELL STEINBERG LA COUNTY SUPERVISOR MARK LUCE GOOD RITAM RIDLEY THOMAS MADE THE SAME POINT. ITS REPORT CONCLUDES THAT IN ORDER TO EXPAND ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT FOR INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS THE STATE SHOULD WORK IN TANDEM WITH COUNTIES TO ENSURE THAT EXISTING FUNDING. ALIGNS WITH THE STATE'S GOALS TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO TREATMENT. TO GUIDE ANY ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS WE NEED TO ASK THE BASIC YET IMPORTANT QUESTIONS. WHERE ARE THESE DOLLARS GOING HOW ARE THEY BEING SPENT AND WHAT OUTCOMES ARE WE ACHIEVING. THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS I SEEK TO ANSWER IN THIS REQUEST FOR A STATE WIDE ON IT OF HOMELESSNESS SPENDING TO HELP US BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT IS AND IS NOT WORKING IN OUR USE OF EXISTING RESOURCES NOTE WHAT IS IT. IS NOT THERE'S A LOT TEMAS I'M SURE BEING DONE THAT ARE WORKING QUITE WELL AND WE WANT TO IDENTIFY WHAT THOSE ARE. SO WE CAN DO MORE OF THEM. THE AUDIT ONE SURE THAT SPENDING IS TRACKED AND RESULTS ARE MEASURED TO HELP THE LEGISLATURE PRIORITIZE. THE MOST EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES IT'LL HELP US. TO MEASURE PROGRESS IN THE WAY THE MAPS. HELPING OUR FELLOW CALIFORNIANS ARE CONSTITUENTS. TRANSITION OUT OF HOMELESSNESS. OR AVOIDED ALTOGETHER. THIS PROPOSAL HAS OVERWHELMING PUBLIC SUPPORT. THE US THE SCHWARZENEGGER INSTITUTE AND PRICE SCHOOL OF PUBLIC CALL UPON THE SEA. JUST CONDUCTED A POLL THAT TESTED THIS SPECIFIC AUDIT REQUEST. EIGHTY SEVEN POINT 5% OF CALIFORNIANS ARE IN SUPPORT. EIGHTY SEVEN FIVE POINT 5% THAT'S WELL ABOVE ANY OTHER PROPOSAL AND FRANKLY A LEVEL OF CONSENSUS RARELY SEEN IN POLITICS. AND OF COURSE RECENT SURVEYS CONSISTENTLY SHOW THAT CALIFORNIANS YOU HOMELESSNESS AS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE FACING THE STATE. IN OTHER WORDS THIS PROPOSAL IS WHAT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA C. AS THE MOST PROMISING STEP FORWARD FOR OUR STATE MOST SERIOUS PROBLEM. THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDS THIS AUDIT CAN PROVIDE THE FOUNDATION FOR A SMARTER AND MORE COMPASSIONATE APPROACH THE HOMELESSNESS. AND THE GOVERNOR UNDERSTANDS THAT TOO AS HE SAID IN THE STATE OF THE STATE MORE MONEY IS NOT GOING TO SOLVE THIS ALONE WE NEED REAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY. THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR HIGH THAT. THANK YOU- MATTER MONITOR PLEASE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER KILEY INDICATED THIS IS A AN AUDIT OF HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA CERTAINLY LOOKING AT FUNDING AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THAT FUNDING SO WHAT HE HAS ASKED US TO DO IS TO LOOK AT A THREE YEAR WINDOW AS FAR AS THE STATE BUDGET STARTING WITH FISCAL YEAR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. A CONTINUING THROUGH NINETEEN TWENTY LOOKING AT HOMELESSNESS FUNDING INCLUDING ANY EMERGENCY A PROVIDED TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ALSO LOOKING AT APPROPRIATIONS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED A REFERENCED IN RECENT EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT THE GOVERNOR SIGNED AND A VARIETY OF THINGS HE'S ASKING US IDENTIFY RESPONSIBLE STATE AGENCIES LOCAL ENTITIES THE FUNDING SOURCE OR COMPONENT FOR EACH OF THOSE ENTITIES. THE PERCENTAGE OF FUNDING THAT IS BEING DIRECTLY OR PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON REDUCING THE HOMELESSNESS POPULATION ARE THE HOMELESS POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA IN ADDITION THE DEPLOYMENT CLIMATE OF THESE EMERGENCY AID FUND IT ARE THOSE FUNDS ACHIEVING MEASURABLE RESULTS CERTAINLY IN THE SHORT TERM ALSO LOOKING AT A SELECTION OF LOCAL AGENCIES GET IT TO THE LOWER LEVEL IN UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE **** WAS ACTUAL TO KILEY INDICATED PREVENTING AT RISK IN THE- FROM BE. HOME I LAST US TRY TO BUY IN A TO MAKE COST POSIT COM AT BY THE OF FUN. AND WHETHER OR NOT THESE CAN BE TRACK AND CAN BE PER SEEN TOWARDS BEAT MEASURABLE GOALS THAT HAVE BEEN A STE I'M. IN THE EXECUTIVE ORDER WHETHER OR NOT THE STORE STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES ARE DEFINING. THEIR MEASURES OF SUCCESS WHETHER OR NOT FUNDING IS ACTUALLY TIED TO OUTCOMES- AND- FOR HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AND INDIVIDUALS AT RISK OF BECOMING HOMELESS. A WHETHER OR NOT THE STATE LOCAL ENTITIES ARE ACTUALLY CALCULATING AND A- ASSESSING AND EVALUATING COST EFFECTIVENESS OF THE- THE MEASURES THAT THEY'VE PUT INTO PLACE TO TRY TO ADDRESS OTHER HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS OR THOSE AT RISK OF BECOMING HOMELESS- A COUPLE OF OTHER OBJECTIVE SEIZE ASSETS. IS THE TRANSPARENCY CAN THE PUBLIC TRACK THESE POSITIVE OUTCOMES BY A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT- SPECIFIC POPULATIONS CAL WORKS FAMILY SENIORS YOUTH FOSTER YOUTH. UP FOLKS WITH A MENTAL ILLNESS AND OTHERS- SUFFERING ARE VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN ADDITION MR KILEY IS ASKING US TO LOOK AT STATE LOCAL ENTITIES AS FAR AS COORDINATION.

ARE THERE ANY IT REDUNDANT IS THAT EXIST ON EARTH TING. THE COORDINATED RESPONSE THE EXPENDITURES AND THEN AGAIN TYING BACK TO ACCOUNTABILITY METRICS A DETERMINING WHETHER THESE METRICS ARE ACKLES. ADEQUATE EXCUSE ME TO MEASURE THE SUCCESS OF EXPENDITURES NOT ONLY TODAY BUT IN THE FUTURE ARE THESE THE RIGHT MEASURES THAT THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE USING. TO DETERMINE WHETHER NOT THE STATE IS A CHEAP. THE GOAL OF REDUCING AND- FULLY SOME ELIMINATE HOMELESS CALIFORNIA AND THEN HIS LAST QUESTION IS ASKING FOR SUGGESTIONS. AND DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THERE NEED TO BE SOME LEGISLATIVE OR EXECUTIVE POLICY CHANGES- TO STRENGTHENED. CALIFORNIA'S APPROACH TO ACHIEVING MEASURABLE RESULTS WITH RESPECT TO REDUCING HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA THE BUDGET FOR THIS AUDIT ABOUT THIRTY THREE HUNDRED HOURS- THAT WOULD TAKE US ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS TO COMPLETE- WE COULD REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TIME- IF WE PUT MORE TEAMS.

THANK YOU MADAM WATER LET'S GO TO MOVE TO THE AFFECTED AGENCIES. PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MAP UNDER THE SUN KEPT. MATT BETTER ACTING DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION OF DTS IS INVOLVEMENT HOMELESSNESS BEGAN SEVEN WEEKS AGO WHEN THE GOVERNOR ISSUED EXECUTIVE ORDER AND TWENTY THREE TWENTY UNDER THAT ODER DTS WAS DIRECTED TO REFUSED STATE OWNED PROPERTY TO IDENTIFY SITES.

A LITTLE EARLY TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR EFFORTS ANOTHER FACTOR TO CONSIDER IS THAT THE BUDGET PROCESS IS ALREADY UNDER WAY BUDGET COMMITTEES ARE RIVER. ARE REVIEWING ALL THE STATE'S PLANS PRIORITIES WITH RESPECT HOMELESSNESS FUNDING ASSEMBLY SUB SIX HELD A HEARING TWO WEEKS AGO ASSEMBLY JUST SUBS WANT FOR LAST WEEK AND A SENATE FULL BUDGET IS MEETING TOMORROW ON THIS. UNFORTUNATELY IN ORDER TO PROVE TODAY AS THE AUDITOR INDICATE WOULD NOT BE READY IN TIME TO INFORM THE IMPORTANT BUDGET DECISIONS MADE BEING MADE THIS YEAR- WITH RESPECT TO THE ISSUES THE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN HAVING A DISCUSSION ON THROUGHOUT THE HEARING- DTS FIRST EARNED ABOUT THIS REQUEST FROM THESE LETTER A WEEK AGO.

WOULD LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO A READ THE FULL SECTION OF THE GOVERNOR'S STATE OF THE STATE THAT I BELIEVE WAS QUOTED IN PART. THE GOVERNOR- WAS. WELL INTO HIS SPEECH AT THIS POINT. SOME OF REQUIRE THE YEARS WHAT HE SAID SOME OF RECOMMENDED A LEGAL RIGHT TO SHELTER IT'S A PROVOCATIVE IDEA WHICH FORCED THE STATE TO EXPLORE THE LIMITS OF WHAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN BE COMPELLED TO DO. RIGHT NOW OUR IMPERATIVE MUST BE BRING GOVERNMENTS TOGETHER AS WORKING PARTNERS NOT SPARRING PARTNERS IN A COURT OF LAW. SO INSTEAD WE ARE PROPOSING STRICT ACCOUNTABILITY COMPREHENSIVE AUDITS AND A DO IT OR LOSE IT POLICY TO HOLD LOCAL GOVERNMENTS RESPONSIBLE FOR RESULTS TAKE ACTION OR LOSE ACCESS TO THIS NEW FUNDING I MENTION THIS ONLY TO NOTE THAT THE ISSUE OF COMPREHENSIVE AUDITS WAS REYES SPECIFICALLY RESPECT WITH RESPECT TO STATE AND LOCAL RELATIONS.

SO WITH THAT LET'S GO AHEAD AND THERE'S NO QUESTIONS FOR MEMBERS OF FROM THE DíAS LET'S GO TO TURN TO. PUBLIC COMMENTS. PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM. HI MR KILEY WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE- YES I JUST- I THINK THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION- AND I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS RIGHT NOW THE GOVERNOR HAS RECOGNIZED AS A TOP PRIORITY- CALIFORNIA'S OF ALL PARTY AFFILIATIONS IDENTIFIED AS THE MOST PRESSING ISSUE FACING THE STATE AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SPENDING MONEY AND SPUN SPENDING AND EFFECTIVELY. THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE THAT REALLY MATTERS FOR FOLKS WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH HOMELESSNESS THAT CAN BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH THAT CAN BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TURNING YOUR LIFE AROUND AND STARTING A FAMILY IN PURSUING YOUR DREAMS OR- YOU KNOW WITH THE RING TO MENTAL ILLNESS OR DRUG ADDICTION AND SO IF WE CAN HAVE THE DATA THE WILL HELP US IDENTIFY WHAT STRATEGIES ARE WHAT. AND WHICH ONES ARTS YOU CAN GET THAT HIGHEST IMPACT AND DO THE MOST GOOD WITH THE FUNDS WE HAVE I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S WELL WORTH THAT AT THE TIME OF THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE IT WOULD BE A VERY VALUABLE TOOL TO INFORM OUR POLICY MAKING FOR THE REST OF IT THE ARMY ON BUT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR ABOUT. OR THANK RISK KILEY. CAN I ASK MAY ASK YOU A QUESTION AND I'M SORRY TO GIVE YOU A HEADS UP ON THIS BUT GIVEN THAT WE PASSED TWENTY TWENTY DASH ONE ONE TWO ALREADY LOOKING AT SOME OF THE HOMELESS SERVICES WHICH WE HAD A DISCUSSION ABOUT- WOULD YOU BE AMENABLE TO HOLDING YOUR REQUEST OVER TO MAYBE THE NEXT HEARING TO SEE WHAT WE ASCERTAIN AND LEARN FROM THE AUDIT THAT THIS COMMITTEES ALREADY VOTED ON I MEAN HOW QUICKLY ARE WE GONNA HAVE THE RESULTS OF THAT ON IT. IT'LL BE OVER OUR NEXT SCHEDULED HEARING FOR J. LACK TENTATIVELY IS PROPOSED FOR THE FIRST WEEK OF AUGUST. BUT WE MAY HEAR. WE MAY DO A HEARING- BEFORE THAT. OKAY I'M AYE AYE THAT'S NOTIDEAL.

YOU KNOW I SUPPORT- SOMEONE WILL READ THIS IS.

BOERNER HORVATH NO BOERNER HORVATH NO GEN GEN HI PATTERSON PERSON HI RUBIO. VOEPEL VOEPEL I WOULD. SENATOR ROTH. GORGEOUS BEEN DOLLARS HERTZBERG. MINING. MORE LOCKED. WIENER. OKAY THAT ITEMS ON CALL THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU. WHERE THIS TIME WILL BE WILL MOVING TO OUR LAST AGENDA ITEM. THIS IS A CHEN ITEM NUMBER SEVENTEEN TWENTY TWENTY DASH ZERO FIVE CITY OF SAN GABRIEL. AND OVER AGAIN WITH THE STATE AUDITOR'S PRESENTATION AND I BELIEVE YOU HAVE CANCER TO OPEN AGAIN. THAT'S CORRECT AGAIN MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS THIS IS A NOT IT WE'RE ASKING AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT THE CITY OF SAN GABRIEL- OUR OUR OUR STAFF WENT AND CONDUCTED AN ASSESSMENT IN THE FALL OF TWENTY NINETEEN- COMPLETED THAT IT ASSESSMENT IN DECEMBER SHARED THE RESULTS WITH THE CITY. BUT CERTAINLY RECEIVE FEEDBACK FROM THE CITY THAT AGAIN IS CONTAINED IN THE ANALYSIS THAT. WE PROVIDED TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS- BUT I WILL ASK MR CHILDREN TWO AGAIN A VERY HIGH LEVEL. OVER THE ISSUES WE IDENTIFIED THAT WE BELIEVE ARE. SUPPORTS THE COMMITTEE'S APPROVAL OF THE ART REQUEST WE HAVE FOR YOU TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. PLEASE OKAY AGAIN FOR THE RIGHT MY NAME IS MIKE TILTON I'M A DEPUTY STATE AUTO. SO SINK PEARL THE FINANCIAL CHALLENGES THAT WERE SEEN THERE REALLY BOILS DOWN TO INSUFFICIENT RESERVES IN CASH TO PAY FOR THEIR ON GOING BILL AND- ALL. FOR THEIR- WERE. BECAUSE BASICALLY AREN'T SAN SAN GABRIEL CHOATE N. AS IN TWO. IN FOURTEEN. THEIR CITY K. OF. A LAW. AND PART OF THE- AGREEMENT WITHOUT LOANS THE CITY HAD TO SET ASIDE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF ITS GENERAL FUND CASH AS COLLATERAL FOR THE LOAN FOR TEN YEARS. SO CONSEQUENTLY TODAY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OF SAN GABRIELS CASH. IS CURRENTLY NOT AVAILABLE FOR SPENDING ON TOP OF THAT OVER THE LAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS SAN GABRIEL ACTUAL EXPENDITURES. HAVE EXCEEDED THEIR REVENUES WHICH AGAIN IS PUTTING FURTHER STRESS ON THEIR GENERAL FUND AS A RESULT OF BOTH THE LOAN AND YOU DEFICIT SPENDING SAN GABRIELS GENERAL FUND RESERVES. DECLINE FROM A POSITIVE TEN MILLION DOLLAR BALANCE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN ALL THE WAY DOWN TO AN EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. IN RESPONSE TO. THESE FINANCIAL CONDITIONS THE CITY'S EXTERNAL AUDITOR HAS EXPRESSED SOME CONCERNS OBVIOUSLY WITH THE CITY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND WITH ITS CONSTITUENTS OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE CITY'S RESPONSE TO THAT IS THEY ARE RELYING ON THE VOTERS TO PASS. A NEW TAX MEASURE NEXT MONTH AND ALSO RECEIVING INCREASE REVENUE FROM A NEW HOTEL THAT'S IN THE PROCESS OF BEING BUILT. SO BASED ON THAT WE LOOKED AT THE CITY'S HISTORIC REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES AND WE PROJECTED THOSE OUT INTO THE FUTURE FOR THREE OR FOUR YEARS AND WHEN WE DID THAT. WE ALSO FACTORED IN SAN GABRIELS OWN TESTAMENTS OF THE NEW REVENUE THAT THE SALES TAX MEASURE WOULD GENERATE IF IT ACTUALLY PASSES. IN THE NEW HOTEL AND WHEN WE DID THAT. OUR ESTIMATE SHOWS THAT THE CITY'S GENERAL FUND WOULD STILL HAVE A NEGATIVE RESERVE BALANCE IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. WE ALSO LOOK AT THE CITY'S BUDGETING PROCESS SEES AND BASICALLY WE FOUND THAT OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THERE BUDGETS HAVE AN OVERLY OPTIMISTIC. AND THAT'S RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT REVENUE SHORTFALLS AND- EXPENDITURE OVERRUNS. THIS IS A QUICK EXAMPLE THERE NINETEEN TWENTY BUT DID INCLUDE PROJECTED REVENUE OF SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. FROM THE TAX MEASURE THAT HASN'T EVEN PASSED YOU. SO IF YOU'RE DE PASS. IT LOOKS LIKELY THE CITY'S EXPENSES ARE GOING TO WORK. AGAIN EXPERTS REVENUES. AREA FOR BERMAN THE COST ANOTHER AREA THAT'S STE ON THIS CHIU FUND. THEY HAVE AN UNFUNDED PENSION LIABILITIES SIXTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS CALPERS PROJECTS AT THEIR ANNUAL WRITTEN. REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS TO THAT PLAN ARE GOING TO INCREASE BY 30% OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. IN ADDITION TO THAT THE CITY HAS NOTHER SIGNIFICANT UNFUNDED LIABILITY FOR ITS POST EMPLOYMENT HEALTH BENEFITS. AND THAT'S FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AND THAT LIABILITIES ALSO INCREASING BECAUSE THE CITY IS NOT FULLY OF FUNDING. THE COST OF THOSE BENEFITS. IN TERMS OF AUDIT OBJECTIVES THAT THE AUDIT ANALYSIS CONTAINS A NUMBER OF OBJECTIVES BUT ESSENTIALLY WHAT IT BOILS DOWN TO IS IF THE AUDIT IS APPROVED WHAT WE'LL DO IS EVALUATE SAN GABRIELS CURRENT FINANCIAL CHALLENGES. AND FINANCIAL CONDITION AND ABILITY TO MEET ITS SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM OBLIGATIONS WHILE CONTINUING TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO ITS RESIDENTS. WE ALSO LIKE TO IDENTIFY THE INVENTORY OF CAUSES OF SAN GABRIELS FINANCIAL CHALLENGES AND FIGURE OUT WHETHER THE CITY. HAS DEVELOPED AN ADEQUATE PLAN FOR DRESSING THOSE CHALLENGES THE THIRD THING THAT WE WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT HIS SAN GABRIELS BUDGETING PROCESS SEAT. TO FIGURE OUT IF THEY ARE COMPLYING WITH BEST PRACTICES AND IS A PART OF THAT WE TAKE A LOOK AT THEIR PROCEDURES AN UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS FOR PROJECTING FUTURE REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES. TO REALLY DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THOSE ARE RESULTING IN BALANCED BUDGETS AND ACCURATE FINANCIAL FORECASTS. WE ESTIMATE THAT THE AUDIT WITH. TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FORTY HOURS AND PROBABLY WOULD TAKE ABOUT FOUR MONTHS TO COMPLETE. THANK YOU WELL IT'S GOING TO MOVE TO THE AFFECTED CITIES PLEASE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HI MY NAME IS MARK LAZARETTO AND THE CITY MANAGER FOR THE CITY OF SAN GABRIEL- KENNETH LEWIS OUR INTERIM FINANCE DIRECTOR. I HAD SOME PREPARED REMARKS THAT I WILL SPARE YOU ALL FROM GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT YOU SPENT- SITTING HERE TODAY PLEASE THINK IT WILL GIVE ME A LITTLE CREDIT FOR NOT GOING INTO THE DETAIL THAT IT WOULD HAVE ALREADY GONE INTO- I'LL TELL YU THAT I'VE ONLY BEEN ON BOARD WITH THE CITY FOR LESS OR A LITTLE. MORE THAN TO JUST OVER TWO YEARS WHEN I CAME INTO THE CITY I FOUND OUT THAT THE- FINANCIAL POSITION THAT THE CITY. ADMINISTRATION WAS FOR TRYING TO THE COUNCIL NICK ANY WAS THERE NAY GREASE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THE ACTUAL YOUR CURRENT. pEVERYTHING THAT HE SAID THIS IS EXACT TROOP AND WHEN WE FOUND THAT OUT- I INFORM THE COUNCIL THE COMMUNITY AND SINCE THAT TO BE THE CASE THE COUNCIL HAS TAKE PRESTIGE STEPS TO. SIZE ARE IS IT I'M CHEN YOUR- BECOME X. OF FINANCE THE TRANCE. OF MAKING SURE THE NEWS ARE BACK HERE THE PROJECT. AND THERE POINT I'M SORRY THE BE. AND TECH BUT I NEED TO CRY HIS OPEN FOR RECORD ON POINT. A AND I TAKE PRIDE IN THIS BIG I'M WITH FOR NINETEEN BUT- AND NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET WE ARE ABSOLUTELY TO OUR REVENUES. WERE PETER ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN A SALES TAX MEASURE THAT WAS ON THE NOT CORRECT THAT WAS FOR THE SALE LOW PRO. EIGHT POUNDS WE IS LAW MONTH WHEN OUR HOUSE APPROVED SAID. TECH IS ON FOR THIS MONTH AND WE DON'T HAVE A THE- FUN OUR CURRENT BUDGET FOR THAT ARE. BUDGET IS BALANCED. I AM PROUD TO SAY AS WELL WOULD PUT IN. BACK OUR OUR RESERVE LAST. YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A DE. ONE THE STATE. CONTACT US IN. WE WERE ALREADY WORKING AND STEALING BEST PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES AND PROCESSES IN ORDER TO HAVE THE INTERNAL CONTROLS THAT BETTER CITIES HAVE. A WERE INCREDIBLE CITY BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE INTERNAL CONTROLS BECAUSE OF THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN NEGLECTED OVER THE YEARS. AND WE ARE PUTTING THOSE INTO PLACE. EVERYTHING THAT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE AUDITOR WERE ALREADY WORKING ON. THE AUDITOR AS WAS DISCUSSED IN IN DISCUSSIONS OF CITIES BEFORE OURS WE LOOK AT THIS AS A VERY COLLABORATIVE COOPERAIVE PROCESS WE LOOK AT THAT AS BEING A PARTNERSHIP. EVERYTHING THAT- MISS HOW HIS STATED ABOUT COMING AND GIVING US MANAGEMENT COACHING IS SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD WELCOME OUR ISSUES ONLY ONE OF TIMING ARTS CITY COUNCIL IS LOOKING FORWARD TO THE AUDIT TO. GIVE US A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH AND ALSO TO FIND ANY AREAS WHERE WE CAN GET BETTER. ON THE ISSUE AGAIN IS ONLY TIMING I TELL YOU WHY THAT IS A TIMING ISSUE AND IT'S TWO FOLD. ONE IS BECAUSE OF THAT LOAN THAT MR TILDEN STATED- THAT IS IN FACT THE CASE THAT WE HAVE A LOAN THAT'S PUTTING A BURDEN ON OUR GENERAL FUND. AND WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF REFINANCING THAT LOAN AS WE SPEAK- WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE THE- STIGMA OF AN AUDIT EVEN THOUGH IT'S MANAGEMENT COACHING IT'S AN ODD- IN TERMS OF THE LENDING WORLD.
