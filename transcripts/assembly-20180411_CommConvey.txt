AB NINETEEN FIFTY NINE EXTENDS THE HIGH COST FUND DAY IN FUND BE PROGRAMS FOR FOUR YEARS THESE PROGRAMS HELP CALIFORNIA'S CARRIERS OF LAST RESORT BY PROVIDING AFFORDABLE AND RELIABLE TELEPHONE SERVICE IN RURAL HIGH COST AREAS OF THE STATE. WELL TO THE PROGRAMS ARE COMPLETELY THE BY THE TWO PROGRAMS ARE COMPLETELY SEPARATE FROM ONE ANOTHER THEY'RE BOTH DESIGNED AND ADMINISTERED TO SUPPORT CARRIERS OF LAST RESORT. EACH CARRIER OF LAST RESORT HAS THE OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE BASIC VOICE SERVICE CAPABLE OF MAKING AND RECEIVING NINE ONE ONE CALLS IN AN AFFORDABLE AND RELIABLE MANNER FOR ALL THE CUSTOMERS IN THE SERVICE AREA AND THIS IS NO SMALL TASK. THE HIGHLY VARIABLE LANDSCAPE OF CALIFORNIA POSES UNIQUE ISSUES. AND ENSURING WIDESPREAD IN AFFORDABLE SERVICES PROVIDING AND MAINTAINING TELECOMMUNICATION NETWORKS IN RURAL REGIONS WAS SPARSELY POPULATED AREAS PAIRED WITH THE ROUGH TERRAIN ARE NOT LUCRATIVE REGION'S FOR TELLING THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES. HOWEVER CALIFORNIA'S COMMITTED TO THE PRINCIPLE OF UNIVERSAL SERVICE THE CONCEPT THAT BASIC TELEPHONE SERVICE SHOULD BE AFFORDABLE AND AVAILABLE TO ALL INDIVIDUALS. CALIFORNIA STATES COMMITTED TO THE PRINCIPLE OF UNIVERSAL SERVICE THROUGH THE HOUSE CALIFORNIA HIGH COST FUND PROGRAM. LAST YEAR THE CPUC ADOPTED A NEW FIRE MAP DESIGNATING EACH AREA OF THE STATE BY ITS DEGREE OF FIRE THREAT. MANY OF THESE DESIGNATED PARTS OF THE STATE A FOUND IN THE BE FUND COVERAGE AREAS. AND ALSO PARTS OF THE A FUND SERVICE AREAS AB NINETEEN FIFTY NINE IS A CRITICAL ASPECT IN ENSURING. THESE RESIDENTS LIVING IN FIRE PRONE AREAS HAVE ACCESS TO NINE ONE ONE. AB NINETEEN FIFTY NINE IS MORE THAN JUST MAKING SURE THAT ALL CALTRAIN STAY CONNECTED IT'S ABOUT MAKING SURE ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE SAFE. I HAVE THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL WITH ME CALIFORNIA'S A INDEPENDENT TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY CAO COM AND FRONTIER TO TESTIFY AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU JUST REMIND EVERYBODY OF FIVE MINUTES FORM PLAINTIFF AGAINST. GOOD AFTERNOON AND I MET MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I WE WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLYMAN WHAT FOR CARRYING THIS BILL IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT BILL THE LEGISLATURE OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS HAS PASSED AN EXTENSION BILL FOR THE HIGH COST FUNDING BE PROGRAMS. TO ENSURE THAT RULE CALIFORNIANS STAY CONNECTED AS YOU KNOW THE A FUND COMPANIES ARE FULLY REGULATED BY THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSIONS WE HAVE TO FILE RATE CASES SO WE ARE FULLY REGULATED. AND AS MENTIONED THESE AREAS ARE VERY TOUGH TERRAIN TYPOGRAPHY INGRID JEER GEOGRAPHIC AREAS MAKE IT VERY CHALLENGING OFTEN POPULATIONS HOMES AND BUSINESSES ARE MILES AND MILES APART. THESE AREAS WOULD NOT BE SERVED WITH AFFORDABLE ESSENTIAL SERVICES WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE IN PARTNERSHIP OF THE UNIVERSAL SERVICE PROGRAM AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND THE CALIFORNIA HIGH COSTS FUND A. PROGRAM HERE IN CALIFORNIA WITHOUT THE THIS PROGRAM IT IS NOT ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE TO SERVE THESE AREAS WE'VE SHARED WITH MANY OF YOU THAT SOME OF THE OF THE COST COULD BE AS MUCH AS TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS. FOR CUSTOMER JUST TO HAVE A TELEPHONE LINE TO BE ABLE TO CALL NINE ONE ONE. WE ARE CARRIERS OF LAST RESORT WERE OBLIGATED TO BE IN THESE AREAS AND SERVE IN OUR AREAS SO TODAY WILL BE SERVING TOMORROW WILL BE SERVING WERE GOING TO ENSURE THAT OUR CUSTOMERS ARE SERVED. WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY TO ENSURE THAT OUR RURAL AREAS STAY CONNECTED. AS YOU KNOW WE OFTEN VACATION WE OFTEN GO YOSEMITE KIRKWOOD WE'VE ALL BEEN TO THESE PLACES THESE ARE ALL A FUND AREAS. AND WE ASK YOUR AYE VOTE TO MAKE SURE THAT CITIZENS AND BUSINESSES ARE CONNECTED THINKING. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE. AND THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD OF THE BILL IS REALLY ABOUT PROGRAMS THAT ARE. ABOUT AFFORDABILITY AND PUBLIC SAFETY AS AUTHOR MENTIONED ON THEY THEY GUARANTEE THAT THERE IS ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE VOICE SERVICE AND ABILITY TO CALL NINE ONE ONE. A AND B. FUND SUPPORT IS PROVIDED TO CARRIERS OF LAST RESORT ONLY FOR THOSE HIGH COST CENSUS BLOCKS WHERE THE COST OF PROVIDING SERVICES ABOUT THIRTY SIX DOLLARS A MONTH. FRONTIERS BASIC BASIC RATE FOR EXAMPLE IS TWENTY TWO DOLLARS BUT WITHOUT BE FUN SUPPORT IT COULD BE TRIPLE THAT AMOUNT TO RECOVER COSTS AND IN SOME CASES BETWEEN HUNDRED AND TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS. AND SECONDLY AS THE AUTHOR POINTED OUT THIS. THE BE FUN ESPECIALLY IS REALLY ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY BOTH PROGRAMS ACTUALLY. BUT IF YOU TAKE THE NEW P. UC FIRE MAP AND LOOK AT WHERE TE HIGHEST FIRE DANGER AREAS AND YOU OVERLY THAT WITH THE HIGH COST. FUND BE FUN CENSUS BLOCKS IT'S LIKE A VERY STRONG DIRECT CORRELATION SO PRESERVING THE ABILITY TO HAVE AFFORDABLE SERVICE WHERE THESE UP RESIDENTS CAN CALL NINE ONE ONE WHEN A FIRE BREAKS OUT ANOTHER EMERGENCY. THIS BILL REALLY PRESERVES OUT AND. ADVANCES PUBLIC SAFETY SO AGAIN THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR. MEMBERS BILL DIVIDE REPRESENTING A T. AND T. I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY WE ARE ALSO A CARRIER OF LAST RESORT AND AS MANY OF YOU KNOW. WE ARE ALSO THE LARGEST PROVIDER OF BASIC TELEPHONE SERVICE UP TO RURAL CALIFORNIA I JUST WANTED TO ADD A COUPLE OF ITEMS HERE TO THE CONVERSATION THE GOAL HERE IS TO KEEP BASIC SERVICE AFFORDABLE REGARDLESS OF WHERE YOU LIVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE PROGRAM IS ALSO COMPETITIVELY NEUTRAL WHILE WE ARE CARRIERS OF LAST RESORT AND WE PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. ANY COMPANY CAN VOLUNTEER TO BECOME A CARRIER OF LAST RESORT AND ALSO QUALIFY FOR THIS SUPPORT IF THEY CHOOSE TO SERVE THESE HIGH COST AREAS. LAUGHS DOT THE LAST INVESTIGATION BY THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION OF THIS PROGRAM WAS OPENED IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE. IT WAS A FIVE YEAR DOCKET AND IT WAS CONCLUDED IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES RECOMMENDED TO THE PROGRAM AT THAT TIME. SO WE DO NOT SUPPORT ANY ADDITIONAL CHANGE TO THE PROGRAM. UP FINALLY. AND THE GOOD NEWS HERE IS THE BE FUND IN PARTICULAR IS RUNNING A HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE MILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS. SO BASED UPON CURRENT EXPENDITURES FROM THE FUND THERE'S ENOUGH FUNDING THERE TO LAST AN ADDITIONAL EIGHT YEARS AND I BELIEVE THIS BILL IS A FIVE YEAR EXTENSION. SO THEY'LL BE NO ADDITIONAL FEES OR TAXES APPLIED TO THE PHONE BILL FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS FROM THIS PROGRAM UNLESS THE COMMITTEE IN THE P. YOU SEE CHOOSE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL REVENUE. I WITH THAT WE LET OUR SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION THANK YOU. IT ONE MINUTE LEFT. PAN LIMITS ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA'S INDEPENDENT TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES. AND. ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF THE I. T. C. RECEIVE A FUND SUPPORT IT. AND I'LL JUST ADD THAT THAT. HERE THE P. C. IS DIRECTED BY THE STATE LEGISLATURE TO BE A GOOD STEWARD OF THE A FIND AND PART OF THAT STEWARDSHIP IS. ABOUT CREATING A RATE BASE THAT THE PHRASE THAT KIND OF EXPENSE THAT WOULD BE OTHERWISE PICKED UP BY THE A FUND. AND I HAD THE TOWN CENTERS WHERE THE POPULATIONS ARE CENTERED OR THE LOCAL BUSINESSES ARE ON MAIN STREET. I REALLY ARE A SIGNIFICANT PART OF DEFYING THE COSTS THAT THE STATE WOULD OTHERWISE. A BEAR FOR AS SERVING THE MORE FAR FLUNG RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS IN THE RURAL AREAS SO WE JUST ADD THE A FUND COMPANIES ARE. PROUD TO BE GOOD STEWARDS OF THE THE PUBLIC FUNDS THAT ARE ENTRUSTED TO THEM TO PROVIDE. A HIGH QUALITY SERVICE IN THE RURAL AREAS THEY SIR THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT REMIND YOU NAME ORGANIZATION POSITIONALLY. TRACY RYAN ROLL COUNTY REPRESENTS OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. CHARITY IS REPRESENTING OFFICER REPAIR ADVOCATES IN SUPPORT. RHONDA ARMSTRONG REPRESENTING CARMEN TELEPHONE COMPANY IN FOREST HILL TELEPHONE COMPANY WERE IN SUPPORT. BRENDA SHEPHERD REPRESENTING VOLCANO TELEPHONE COMPANY WERE IN SUPPORT. REGION ACOSTA REPRESENTING TURN WORD SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON BERNIE ROSCOE AT HELPING TO CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION. WANTED TO JUST A MOMENT A POSSIBLE ABOUT THESE PROGRAMS THAT THE HIGH COST ON A IN THE PROGRAM TO DIFFERENT PROGRAMS HERE WE HAVE A POSITION ON A SEPARATE ON FOR EACH PROGRAM. SO WE ARE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED AND. WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS OVER THE YEARS IN THE PAST WE HAVE BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF THE PROGRAM'S BEEN A GOOD PROGRAM? BUT IT DISTINCTION BETWEEN. THE THE CARRIES OF LAST RESORT AND IN OUR INDUSTRY IS. WE ARE FACILITIES WERE NOT BUILT WITH REPAIR FUNDS SO THERE IS AN OBLIGATION ON SOME FOLKS THAT HAVE USE RATE HERE FUNDS OVER THE YEARS TO BUILD THESE NETWORKS. SO IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE SOME SORT OF OBLIGATION. AND SO WE WE PUT SUPPORT OF THAT THE PAST SERVICE WAS REALLY WANTS. TO GET HOME. WHAT WE WERE LOOKING AT ON HIGH COSTS FUND A PROGRAM SO THESE ARE THE SMALL RURAL ILEX CENTER? AT ABOUT THIRTEEN OF THEM IN THE STATE. AS WE EXPAND OUR FACILITIES OUT TO THE RURAL AREAS AND HE'S ERIC ROYER HAS BECOME MORE POPULATED WE HAVE FACILITIES THERE SO WE ARE IN SOME OF THESE THESE COMMUNITIES TODAY. AND ALL THAT WE'RE ASKING IS THAT WE BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY COMPETE WITH EVERYONE ELSE BECAUSE IT DOES AREAS ARE PROTECTED AT THIS POINT. SO OUR PROPOSED AMENDMENT THAT WE'RE SUGGESTING TODAY IS THAT. THE COMMISSION. IN REVIEWING SOME STUDIES COMPARATIVE STUDIES BETTER INDIVIDUALIZED FOR EACH OF THESE COMMUNITIES. THAT WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF THAT FINAL REPORT THAT THEY JUST TAKE A LOOK AND MAKE A DETERMINATION WHETHER OR NOT THAT COMMUNITY SHOULD BE OPEN TO COMPETITION. AND THAT'S IT NOW THE COMMISSION COMES BACK AND SAYS NO WE DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S ENOUGH COMPETITION IN THIS COMMUNITY THAN FIND THEN WE WILL LIVE WITH THAT. SO THAT'S OUR FIRST MET FOR THE HIGH COST BUT HEY. THE HIGH COST FUND BE COMMUNITY SO THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT HAS PROGRESSIVELY. REDUCE ITSELF IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN IS ROUGHLY FOUR HUNDRED NINETY MILLION DOLLARS TODAY IT'S A PROBABLY ABOUT TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS TODAY. BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT MORE MORE COMPETITION LOWER THAN THOSE RURAL AREAS AND WE JUST BELIEVE IT IS TIME THAT WE ALSO. SHOULD HAVE EQUAL FOOTING IN A COMPETITION IN THOSE COMMUNITIES SO ALL THAT WE'RE ASKING AND THAT AMENDMENT IS THAT THE PC. ONCE AGAIN A PAUSE AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE HIGH COST FUND A COMMUNITIES AND SAY. IS THIS A PRO THAT'S WORTHY OF CONTINUATION. WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS FROM THE LEGISLATURE IS A DESIRE TO BUILD MORE AND MORE RURAL BROADBAND WE HAVE? RIGHT NOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS APPROVED OVER HALF A BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE TELEPHONE CORPORATIONS IN THE RURAL AREAS TO BUILD OUT THEIR FACILITIES NOW IT'S FOR BROADBAND BUT YOU WOULD GET COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES WITH THAT AS WELL. JUST LAST YEAR THIS COMMITTEE APPROVED AND THE MISTER CHAIR YOU HELPED ORCHESTRATE THE PASSAGE OF THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCED SERVICES FUND. THAT'S THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN INFRASTRUCTURE NIGHT I REALIZE HE'S OUR INFRASTRUCTURE DOLLARS HE'S ARE NOT SUBSIDIES TO OFFSET BUT THESE ARE DOLLARS THAT CAN HELP REDUCE OPERATIONAL COSTS. SO AT THIS POINT WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS PC JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THE HIGH COST FUND BE. TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION ALL THE NEW FUNDS THAT ARE COMING IN FROM THE FAT IN FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND DECIDE IS THIS REALLY A PROGRAM. THAT SENDS THE RIGHT SIGNAL TO COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE WRITERS THAT WE PUT THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE. WOULD WANT TO ENSURE THAT. BROADER ADVANCED COMMUNICATION SERVICES ARE BEING DEPLOYED NOT MAINTAINING A PAY BASIC TELEPHONE LINE SO THAT'S UP FOR WITHOUT THE TO MEMBERS WE ARE OPPOSED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS JAMES JACK ON BEHALF OF CAL TELL A UNFORTUNATELY WE MUST OPPOSE THIS BILL AS WELL BECAUSE CAL TELL DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT IT'S APPROPRIATE. TO EXTEND ANY FURTHER A FUND SUBSIDIES TO PROVIDERS AS LONG AS THESE PROVIDERS STILL ENJOY A MONOPOLY PROTECTION FROM THE PVC. THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE ORDERED THAT ALL TELECOMMUNICATIONS MARKETS BE OPEN TO COMPETITION NO LATER THAN JANUARY FIRST NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN. IT'S UNIMAGINABLE THAT OVER TWO DECADES LATER THIS IS STILL NOT OCCURRED IN CALIFORNIA IS A FUN MARKETS. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THE PC DECIDED TO STUDY WHETHER TO OPEN THESE MARKETS TO COMPETITION. IT'S NOW TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND WE HAVE NO STUDY AND NO ACTION. OPENING TELCO MARKETS TO COMPETITION ACROSS CALIFORNIA HAS RESULTED IN TREMENDOUS CONSUMER BENEFIT IN PRICE SERVICE AND INNOVATION. YET THESE A FUN TERRITORIES ARE THE ONLY MARKETS LEFT IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY WERE PROVIDERS ARE STILL PROTECTED UNDER ANTIQUATED MONOPOLY SYSTEM. EVEN THOUGH WERE PROHIBITED BY STATUTE FROM RECEIVING THE A FUND SUBSIDY WE WANT TO COMPETE AGAINST THESE PROVIDERS DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY RECEIVE. A SIXTY DOLLAR MONTHLY A FUND SUBSIDY BUT CAL TELL SIMPLY CANNOT. SUPPORT CONTINUING IN A FUN PROGRAM WHERE CAL TELLS RATEPAYERS SUBSIDIZE MONOPOLY PROVIDERS IN AREAS WHERE CAL TELL MEMBER COMPANIES AREN'T ALLOWED TO COMPETE. WE MUST OPPOSE THIS BILL UNTIL IT IS AMENDED TO RESOLVE THIS IMPORTANT CONCERT THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR IF I CAN SAY WITHIN A FIVEMINUTE I FORGOT I NEGLECTED TO MAKE ONE FINAL POINT. EVEN WITH OUR PROPOSED AMENDMENT FOR THE HIGH COST WHEN A PROGRAM. IF THE COMMISSION WERE TO OPEN THAT. THAT SERVICE TERRITORY FOR COMPETITION WE WOULD ELIMINATE THE SUBSIDIES SO WITH OUR AMENDMENTS. SO ALLRED SKIN IS THIS CONSIDERATION FOR THE P. YOU SEE MOVING FORWARD YOU WOULD STILL THAT THE PROGRAM WOULD STILL BE REAUTHORIZED FOR FIVE MORE YEARS SO. AND SO WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO ELIMINATE THE PROGRAMMING NEATLY WITH YOUR VOTE TODAY WITH YOUR VOTE TODAY ALL RESTING FOR IS TO HAVE THE PC. A SECOND LOOK AT THIS AND SO NO NO ELIMINATION OF THE HIGH COST ONE A SUBSIDY EVEN IF YOU WERE TO GO FORWARD WITH THIS. THANK YOU WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. AND START. ADDITIONAL WITNESSES OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS. FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SO ONE OF THE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. ABOUT MR WORD I. THINK YOU FOR BRING THE BILL FORWARD I AGREE WITH YOU THAT. THIS PROGRAM IS STILL NEEDED. AND. I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY I BUT I HAD A QUESTION BECAUSE IN IN THE LARGER CONTEXT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE THAT'S TAKEN PLACE. SINCE THESE HIGH COST FUNDS WERE. PUT INTO PLACE. SO NOW WE'VE GOT A THE PROLIFERATION OF MOBILE PHONES INSTEAD OF LAND LINE PHONES WE GOT MORE AND MORE PEOPLE WHO. THANKS TO THE EFFORTS OF A LOT OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM CAN NOW ACCESS BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE FROM THEIR RURAL HOMES AND ARE CHOOSING TO OUR TO PIGGYBACK TELECOMMUNICATIONS ON THOSE. AND SATELLITE PHONES ARE ARE MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE RIGHT LET MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE AND SERVICES MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE THAN IT EVER HAS BEEN BEFORE SO. INEVITABLY THERE WILL COME A TIME. WHEN THIS KIND OF SUPPORT IS NO LONGER NECESSARY. AND ARE WE DON'T HAVE TO FORCED TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES TO BE THE OUR PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT IN THE AREAS THESE AREAS. I IT SO MY QUESTION IS. WHAT ARE WE GONNA BE HERE FIVE YEARS FROM NOW REAUTHORIZING THE PROGRAM OR IN YOUR OPINION IS THIS? THE LAST REAUTHORIZATION THIS NEED AT THIS GOING TO GET US TO THIS POINT WHERE WE DON'T HAVE TO DO IT ANYMORE WILL HAVE LOVED BILL TO SAY THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE HERE IN FIVE YEARS. AND FIRST BOUGHT AND NOBODY'S FORCES ANYBODY TO BE CAREFUL LAST RESORT THAT'S A VOLUNTARY YOU YOU SIGN UP FOR THIS YOU TAKE THE FUNDS YOU YOU BECOME YOU TAKE THAT RESPONSIBILITY. ARM THESE ARE THE MOST DIFFICULT PLACES TO REACH IN GENERAL AND SO. WHILE OUR GOAL AS YOU SAW LAST YEAR. WITH A. B. SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE WITH IT IS TO GET TO NINETY EIGHT PERCENT COVERAGE IN EVERY REGION OF THE STATE. AND SO MY HOPE IS THAT WILL BE IT WILL BE MUCH CLOSER ON CAN I SAY THAT ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS THIS KIND OF TECHNOLOGY NOW I DON'T I DON'T KNOW THAT FOR SURE. MY HOPE IS THAT THE MAYBE THAT REESE AND THE NEED FOR RESOURCES WILL BE MUCH LESS. THAN PURE. THAT PEOPLE WE NEED TO SERVE SERVE WILL BE MUCH LESS AND WILL BE MUCH CLOSER TO YOU KNOW A HUNDRED PERCENT COVERAGE OF EVERYONE WITH A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF SERVICE. WELL I. CERTAINLY AGREE WITH YOU THAT WE STILL WE'RE NOT THERE YET. I'M HOPEFUL LIKE YOU THAT WE'RE GONNA BE THERE IN FIVE YEARS I'M NOT SURE MY ANSWER FIVE YEARS FROM NOW WILL BE MY ANSWERS TODAY BUT. HAVE TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL. I HOPE I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT CONVERSATION. MR MATHIS. THE SWELLING THE AUTHOR MISSED WORDS OFFERING THIS FOR AND I KNOW MY FOLKS A BACK HOME WITH YOU CORD TELEPHONE. WHO SERVE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF FOLKS WHO LIVE? UP IN THE HIGH SIERRAS. AND WAY OUT MIL OF NO WHERE. DEFINITELY THANK YOU FOR KEEPING THEIR RATES DOWN WITH THIS BILL STUFF THANK YOU FOR BRINGING AFFORDABLY SPORTING. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. JOINT CLOSE. THAT SAY THAT TED THE CONTINUATION OF THESE PROGRAMS IS CRITICAL TO ENSURE THAT COMMUNICATION SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS ON I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVAL. WE ALREADY HAD A FIRST AND A SECOND. THIS MEASURE ENJOYS THAT YOUR SUPPORT MEANT SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. BUSH'S DO PASTA COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS SANTIAGO AYE AYE SANTIAGO AYE OBERNOLTE. OBERNOLTE AYE BONTA CERVANTES. CERVANTES AYE EDUARDO GARCIA. EDUARDO GARCIA AYE HOLDEN. HOLDEN I WOULD TRY WOULD AYE MAIENSCHEIN. MAIENSCHEIN AYE MATHIS. MATHIS I O'DONNELL. PATTERSON. PATTERSON AYE QUIRK SILVA. QUIRK SILVA I'VE ADREUS. RODRIGUEZ I. ELEVEN ZERO MEASURES OUT. MISTER WOOD WOOD TO CONTINUE IN PRESENTING ITEM NUMBER THREE AB TWENTY NINE TEN. MY PLEASURE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I FIRST WOULD LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND SIX SUGGESTED AMENDMENT AND THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL. IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE DEVASTATING FIRES THAT RATE RAVITCH CALIFORNIAN LATE TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN THE STATE AND THE CPUC ARE FOCUSED HEAVILY ON UTILITIES RESPONSE TO MASSIVE TO THE MASSIVE DESTRUCTION. HARPER LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE IMPACT. THESE NATURAL DISASTERS HAVE HAD ON THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS AND HOW TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES HAVE RESPONDED. WHILE WE AGREE THAT THE CPUC HAS THE AUTHORITY TO COLLECT THE INFORMATION SPECIFIED IN THIS BILL THE CPU ES CPUC IS NOT REQUIRED TO REPRODUCE A REPORT. TO DATE THE CP YOU SEE HAS NEVER REPRODUCE SUCH A REPORT. WE HAVE BEEN LEFT IN THE DARK WHEN IT COMES TO UNDERSTANDING THE TECHNOLOGY THAT MAY BE USE TO REBUILD INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE NORTH BAY. AND WHETHER COMPANIES HAVE TEMPORARY FIXES IN PLACE OR INSTEAD INVESTED IN PERMANENT UPGRADES WITHOUT THIS INFORMATION THERE'S NO WAY TO ENSURE THAT RESIDENTS WILL HAVE THE SAME OR IMPROVED ACCESS. TO A RELIABLE NETWORK. ON OCTOBER TENTH THE HUMBOLDT COUNTY SHERIFF'S DE IT DECLARED A LOCAL EMERGENCY IN MY DISTRICT DUE TO WIDESPREAD. BUT A SERVICE FAILURE IS CAUSED BY THE NORTH BY FIRES. AND THAT WASN'T IN THE COUNTIES THAT WERE ACTUALLY ON FIRE. THAT WAS NORTH OF US. THE OUTAGES SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED EMERGENCIES SERVICES AND GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE AGENCIES THAT PROVIDE ESSENTIAL PUBLIC SERVICES. AB TWENTY NINE TEN WOULD REQUIRE THE CPUC TO REPORT TO THE APPROPRIATE POLICY COMMITTEE OF THE LEGISLATURE. THE IMPACT OF A NATURAL DISASTER ON THE STATE'S TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORK AND THE RESPONSE OF THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES. AS TIME PASSES IT'S UNLIKELY THAT DAMAGED OR DESTROYED NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE WILL BE REPLACED. IT IS LIKELY EXCUSE ME IT IS LIKELY THAT THERE THEY WILL BE REPLACED. THERE IS STRONG PUBLIC INTEREST ENSURING THAT NEWER EQUIPMENT RESULTS IN IMPROVED AND MORE RESILIENT SERVICES. THIS BILL WOULD NOT REQUIRE WHAT NOT REQUIRED TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES TO DIVULGE INFORMATION. THAT WOULD BE HARMFUL TO SECURITY SUCH AS TO DISCLOSURE ADDRESSES A PROPOSED NETWORK FACILITIES. LOCATIONS OR AN ITEMIZED LIST OF THE ACTUAL EQUIPMENT THAT'S BEEN DEPLOYED. THE FACT THAT TELECOMMUNICATIONS LINES ARE DAMAGED OR AN EXTENDED OUT IS TAKES PLACE DURING NATURAL DISASTERS. INCLUDING OUTAGES AFFECTING NINE ONE ONE SERVICES IS NOT A SECRET SUCH OUT PROFIT SUCH OUTAGES ARE OFTEN REPORTED IN THE MEDIA. AND TRUST ME I GET PHONE CALLS FROM PEOPLE ABOUT THIS AS WELL. ALTHOUGH THE BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION TO BE HARMFUL THE PUBLIC SAFETY I WILL BE WORKING WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THAT SUCH INFORMATION IS PROTECTED. CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT. I RECEIVED THE OPPOSITION'S PROPOSED AMENDMENTS LATE YESTERDAY AND HAVE BUT NOT HAVE A TIME TO FULLY REVIEW THEM. SHOULD THIS BILL MOVE FORWARD THROUGH THE PROCESS WILL COMMIT TO WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION AND STAKEHOLDERS TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF REGINA COSTA A WITH TURN AND KEITH GIBSON LOCAL PRESIDENT AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE POLICY CHAIR. OF CALPERS A COMMUNICATION WORKERS OF AMERICA. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON REGINA COST ON THE TELECOM POLICY DIRECTOR FOR TURN THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK AND WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO SPONSOR THIS BILL. AND WE THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD. WE SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE IT WOULD ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE MEMBERS REPRESENTING AREAS HIT BY NATURAL DISASTERS ARE FULLY INFORMED ABOUT COMMUNICATION OUTAGES CAUSED BY THESE EVENTS. THE EXTENT THE DURATION THE IMPACT ON NINE ONE ONE SERVICE AND HOW THE SERVICE IS BEING RESTORED. THIS BILL IS ABOUT REPORTING. WHEN OUTAGES OCCUR LEGISLATORS NEED TO BE INFORMED ABOUT THE EXTENT AND WHERE THE OUTAGES OF TAKEN PLACE WHEN IT WAS RESTORED FOR DIFFERENT AREAS. AND WHETHER THE TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT MEANS WERE USED TO RESTORE THAT SERVICE. AND IF A TEMPORARY SOLUTION IS IN PLACE THEN WHAT'S THE LONG TERM PLAN. THE BILL IS ABOUT TRANSPARENCY YOU NEED TO KNOW WHETHER THERE ARE POCKETS OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS WHO HAVE SUFFERED LONGER TERM OUTAGES. THAT ALLOWS YOU TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES AT SOME POINT. TURN HAS BEEN ACTIVE ON THESE ISSUES FOR MANY YEARS WE HAVE HEARD FROM NUMEROUS CUSTOMERS WHO HAVE LOST SERVICE IN FIRES AND IN LARGE STORMS. WHO HAVE HAD THEIR SERVICE? OUT OF OUT OF SERVICE FOR QUITE SOME TIME. OUR MOST RECENTLY WILL VARY IT FAIRLY RECENTLY WE HEARD FROM FOLKS IN BIG SUR. WHO A LOT SERVICE AND FIRES BUT THAT SERVICE WAS NOT RESTORED FOR WEEKS AND IN SOME CASES MONTHS? THIS IS THE TYPE OF INFORMATION THAT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE. WHAT THE BILL WILL NOT DO IT WILL NOT RESULT IN ADDITIONAL REGULATION OR PROCEEDINGS AT THE COMMISSION? THE SIMPLE PURPOSE OF THE BILL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE ACCURATE INFORMATION ABOUT THE IMPACT OF DISASTERS ON ON THESE FACILITIES AND SERVICES AND INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESTORATION. WE URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THE BILL. CHAIRMAN SANTIAGO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY. MY NAME IS KEEP GIVE THE PRESIDENT OF THE COMMUNICATION WORKERS OF AMERICA LOCAL NINETY FOUR TWELVE REPRESENTING DISTRICT NINE WHICH INCLUDES CALIFORNIA NEVADA AND HAWAII. HERE IN CALIFORNIA CW A REPRESENTS MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND EMPLOYEES AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS CUSTOMER SERVICE MEDIA AIRLINES PUBLIC SERVICE AND MANUFACTURING. WE SUPPORT AB TWENTY NINE TEN AS A COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY GOOD JOBS AND UPGRADING OF THE COMMUNICATION NETWORKS AFTER NATURAL DISASTERS. THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE THAT THE P. YOU SEE TO REPORT ANNUALLY TO THE LEGISLATURE ON HOW TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS RESTORE. BUT SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY AFTER THE DECLARED STATE OF EMERGENCY IT WOULD ALSO AUTHORIZE THE COMMISSION TO REQUIRE TELECOMMUTE CASES SERVICE PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE ANY RELEVANT INFORMATION. TO THE COMMISSION. I'M PROUD OF THE THOUSANDS OF SAID CW A MEMBERS EMPLOYED BY EIGHTEEN T. WHO WORK LONG HOURS TO GET BOTH LANDLINE AND WIRELESS EMERGENCY SERVICE UP AND RUNNING. AND QUICKLY AS QUICKLY AND SAFELY AS POSSIBLE. NOW WITH THE IMMEDIATE CRISIS BEHIND US. POLICY MAKERS IN THE PUBLIC NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY ARE DOING TO REBUILD THE DAMAGED NETWORKS. OR THE COMINT PROVIDERS MEAN THEIR STATUTORY CARRIER OF LAST RESORT OBLIGATION BY REPAIRING THE NETWORK TO ENSURE THAT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO QUALITY FOR SERVICE. ARE THEY USING THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO UPGRADE THE NETWORKS WITH FIBER TECHNOLOGY AND IF SO WHERE. OR ARE THEY SIMPLY SPEAKING WITH TEMPORARY FIXES IN PLACE FOR THE PERMANENT UPGRADES THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE THE LEGISLATIVE THE CPUC AND THE PUBLIC WITH INFORMATION WHICH IS NEEDED. TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS. S. AB TWENTY NINETEEN IT WOULD GIVE THE LEGISLATIVE THE CP YOU SEE THE PUBLIC THE INFORMATION WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS REPAIR. OF TELECOMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE DAMAGE DURING NATURAL DISASTERS MEETS THE STATUTORY OBLIGATION AND PROMOTES PUBLIC SAFETY DEPLOYMENT OF HIGH SPEED BROADBAND NET NETWORKS AND GOOD JOBS. IF THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT CONFIDENTIALITY FOR COMPETITIVE REASONS I'M SURE THE CONCERNS CAN BE ADDRESSED YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE. THANK YOU WE HAVE MEMBERS. IN THIS HEARING TODAY WHO'VE LOST THEIR HOUSES DUE TO THE FIRE THEY NEED TO KNOW WHEN THEIR SERVICE IS GOING TO BE RESTORED THANK YOU. THE MARKETS WITH THE OFFICER A PAIR OF TICKETS WERE. BE HERE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. ALL BE VERY QUICK ABOUT THIS THIS BILL WOULD HELP ADVANCE THE STATE SAFETY GOALS BY PUTTING KEY INFORMATION BEFORE YOU THE DECISION MAKERS. TWO MAKE WELL INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT HOW TO TREAT THE SERVICE OUTAGES. WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT. I THINK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT ONCE AGAIN NAME ORGANIZATION AND POSITION ONLY. TRADING RYAN ON THE ROLE COUNTY REPRESENTS A CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. MORGAN KARBALA ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA ALSO IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MEMBERS OF COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BILL DEVINE AND I STILL REPRESENT EIGHTEEN TAKE. THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY. I ALSO WANNA MAKE AN OBSERVATION JUST A MOMENT AGO YOU HAD THE OPPORTUNITY. TO SEE A MEMBERS OF CW A WHO REPRESENT EIGHTEEN T. ANOTHER COMPANIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. STAND UP AND AND I'D LIKE TO MAKE THE OPRY OBSERVATION THAT REGARDLESS OF THE FACT THAT WE THAT WE DO AGREE OR DISAGREE ON THIS PARTICULAR POLICY. THESE ARE THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE ON THE FRONT LINES DURING THESE DISASTERS. THEY ARE RESTORING NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE. I IN THE WAKE OF THESE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS SO WE ARE PROUD TO HAVE THEM AS MEMBERS OF OUR COMPANY WE ARE PROUD TO ASSOCIATE WITH THEM AS COLLEAGUES. SO WE THANK THEM FOR COMING AND THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY TODAY. ARE LET ME GET ON WITH MY TESTIMONY WE OPPOSE OBVIOUSLY THE BILL I DON'T THINK WE'RE THAT FAR APART. OUR AND WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO WORK WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD OF FOLLOWING THIS HEARING TO FIND A SWEET SPOT THAT BALANCES THE VARIOUS INTEREST INVOLVED. WE KNOW. WE KNOW THAT MAINTAINING COMMUNICATIONS DURING AND AFTER A DISASTER IS CRITICAL FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE BEEN DOING IT FOR A HUNDRED AND FORTY YEARS. WE WORK WITH FIRST RESPONDERS TO PROTECT AND MAINTAIN CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE STATE. AND DURING AND AFTER A DISASTER WE WORK TO RESTORE THOSE SERVICES WHEN DAMAGE WHETHER IT'S A NATURAL DISASTER OR ON OCCASION VANDALISM. TODAY THE P. YOU SEE ALREADY HAS TIMELY ACCESS. THE INFORMATION BOTH PUBLIC AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION FROM FCC OUTAGE REPORTS INCLUDING OUTAGES AFFECTING NINE ONE ONE. FURTHER THE PEACE SHE HAS BROUGHT EXISTING AUTHORITY IN P. YOU CODES. FIVE EIGHTY ONE FIVE EIGHTY TWO AND FIVE EIGHTY FOUR THAT GIVES THEM THE AUTHORITY TO COLLECT ANY NETWORK DATA. THAT THEY DEEM NECESSARY TO INVESTIGATE OUTAGES AND NETWORK PERFORMANCE. SO THEY HAVE THE DATA. IT'S AVAILABLE TODAY. ARE. SOME OF IT. IS PUBLIC AND SOME OF IT HAS TO BE MAINTAINED AS CONFIDENTIAL FOR PURPOSES OF NETWORK SECURITY AND THAT IS A CRITICAL ISSUE. NOW WHAT I'D LIKE TO ADD TO THE CONVERSATION TODAY IS THE P. YOU SEE CURRENTLY HAS A SERIES OF PROCEEDINGS. ALREADY UNDERWAY THE TOUCH ON MANY OF THE ASPECTS OF WHAT. SUPPORTERS HAVE TESTIFIED TO TODAY THEY HAVE PROCEEDINGS OPEN TODAY ON FIRE THREAT MAPS HAZARD REPORTING. OUTAGE REPORTING UNDER GROUNDING POLL SAFETY AND MOST RECENTLY POST DISASTER CONSUMER PROTECTION. THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF PROCEEDINGS AND THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF INFORMATION BEING PROVIDED TO THE COMMISSION. NOW WE UNDERSTAND IT'S IMPORTANT TO LEGISLATORS IT'S IMPORTANT TO THE COMMUNITIES IT'S IMPORTANT HERE DISTRICTS. THAT THE IMPACT OF THE WILD FIRES AND OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS UP BE AVAILABLE TO CITIZENS AS WELL AS THE RESTORATION WORK IT'S GOING ON IN THE COMMUNITIES. AND SO WE WILL WORK WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD TO FIND A SWEET SPOT TO FURTHER ENHANCE THOSE COMMUNICATIONS. BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE IF WE LEFT THE HEARING TODAY. WITH WITH THE MIS. THAT THIS INFORMATION IS NOT ALREADY BEING PROVIDED ALREADY IN PROCESS AT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AND ALREADY AVAILABLE TO THIS LEGISLATURE. ARE BASED UPON A PHONE CALL. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY. HOW JACQUI CAN WITH FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS FRONTIER SHARES THE AUTHORS COMMITMENT TO ENSURE SAFE AND RELIABLE COMMUNICATION SERVICE AND RAPID RESTORATION OF SERVICE IN THE WAKE OF FIRES IN NATURAL DISASTERS? HOWEVER WE RESPECTFULLY RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB TWENTY NINE TEN IN ITS CURRENT FORM. PRIMARILY BECAUSE IT DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE MANY OTHER INITIATIVES CURRENTLY UNDERWAY AT THE P. YOU SEE AND THE LEGISLATURE RELATED TO FIRES ENOUGH FOR DISASTERS. THAT DIRECTLY IMPACT PUBLIC SAFETY. FRONTIER AND OTHER PROVIDERS ARE FULLY ENGAGED IN THESE ONGOING INITIATIVES AND COMPLYING WITH EXISTING REQUIREMENTS FOR PREVENTING FIRES REPORTING OUTAGES RESTORING SERVICE CAPABLE OF CALLING NINE ONE ONE. AND RECEIVING EMERGENCY ALERTS. TO NAME JUST A FEW FRONTIERS WORKING TO IMPLEMENT THE VERY COSTLY NEW INSPECTION AND FACILITY REQUIREMENTS JUST ADOPTED BY THE P. YOU SEE A FEW MONTHS AGO IN THE FIRE MATT PROCEEDING. WERE ALSO WORKING ON CASF INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS TO EXPAND BROADBAND TO HIGH FIRE DANGER AREAS AS SPECIFICALLY DIRECTED BY THE P. YOU SEE IN THE DECISION APPROVING FRONTIERS FOR OUR ACQUISITION OF VERIZON. WERE ALSO COMPLYING WITH TO P. YOU SEE RESOLUTIONS IMPOSED POST DISASTER IMPOSING POST DISASTER REQUIREMENTS AFTER THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN FIRES. AND WERE ENGAGED IN THE BRAND NEW PROCEEDING. AND I'D I'D WANT TO JOIN IN MY. IN BILLS ARE URGING YOU TO NOT VAUDEVILLE QUICKLY TO ADOPT DUPLICATIVE REQUIREMENTS AND ESPECIALLY TO LOOK AT THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THIS COMMITTEE TO DO OVERSIGHT ON THE CASF PROGRAM WHERE WE COULD GET PROJECTS MOVING THAT WOULD BRING BROADBAND TO HIGH FIRE DANGER AREAS. A LOT OF THE UNSERVED AREAS OF THE STATE THEY WIND UP WITH WHERE THE HIGH FIRE DANGEROUS SO WE THINK THAT IT IS ANOTHER EFFORT THAT THIS COMMITTEE COULD UNDERTAKE. TO REALLY HELP US MOVE FORWARD WITH IMPLEMENTING THE LEGISLATION YOU ENACTED LAST YEAR ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE. COMMIT TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHORED RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AT THIS TIME THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION AGAIN AND NAME ORGANIZATION AND POSITION MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS STEVE CARLSON PROCEED TIA THE TRADE ASSOCIATION FOR VIOLENCE INDUSTRY FOR THE REASONS STATED WE. ARE WE OPPOSE. AND BUT WE'D LIKE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH MISTER WHAT. LORNE GREENE WENT WITH THE CALIFORNIA CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION ALSO HAS. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THIS OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THAT LOOKED I THINK EVERYONE HERE ON THE DIETS AGREEMENT. IT'S. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES GET RESTORED AFTER NATURAL DISASTER. LA I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO HEAR. YOUR RESPONSE TO WHAT I THINK THE MAIN. ARGUMENT OPPOSITION FOR THE BILL IS WHICH IS THAT THE P. YOU SEE RD HAS BROAD AUTHORITY TO REQUEST THIS INFORMATION FROM ALL OF THE AFFECTED UTILITIES. AND THEY CAN REQUEST AT ANY TIME THEY WANT TO THEY DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR WHAT THIS BILL DOES WHICH IS AN ANNUAL REPORT TO BE COMPILED THEY COULD REQUEST THE INFORMATION RIGHT AFTER. A NATURAL DISASTER TO BE MUCH MORE TIMELY SO. I DIE QUESTION I GUESS WHETHER NOT THIS IS THE RIGHT VEHICLE FOR TABULATING THAT INFORMATION AND I'D LIKE TO HEAR THE RESPONSE TO THAT ARGUMENT. WELL YOU'RE ACTUALLY RIGHT THEY CAN THEY CAN REQUEST INFORMATION BUT THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT TO PRODUCE REPORTS. THAT'S WHAT I WANT I WANT THAT INFORMATION SO THAT CONSUMERS. AND KNOW THAT THEY'RE THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE OUT SERVICES ARE BEING RESTORED IN AT LEAST THE SAME WAY. OR BETTER WAY BUT THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT FOR THE CP FOR THE CPC TO ISSUE SUCH REPORT EVEN THOUGH THEY CAN COLLECT THE INFORMATION BUT DON'T YOU THINK THE P. YOU SEE IS JUST AS INTERESTED AS WE ARE IN MAKING SURE THOSE SERVICES ARE ARE RESTORED. AYE CONSIDERING THE NUMBER OF OPEN. OPEN ITEMS WITH THE P. YOU SEE. AND THE TIME AT WHICH IT TAKES FOR SOME OF THOSE FOR SOME OF THAT TO COME OUT. I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT BUT I'D I'D I'M NOT SURE THAT. THAT THE INFORMATION IS IS GETTING OUT IN A TIMELY MANNER AND AND TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE WHEN PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING WITHOUT SERVICE. ALRIGHT WELL FAIR ENOUGH A. DO YOU WORRY ABOUT. THE FACT BECAUSE THIS ISN'T ONLY AN ANNUAL REQUIREMENT THAT. ELEVEN MONTHS COULD GO BY AFTER A NATURAL DISASTER IN. THE DATA THAT'S IN THE REPORT THERE PROVIDING HOUSES THAN STALE. I WOODS I WOULD SAY THAT. IT'S. MAYBE IT MEANT MAY MIGHT BE STALE I WOULD SAY I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF THEY COULD YOU KNOW. HOW HOW THAT WOULD BE PUT TOGETHER IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME ANYWAY? I'M LOOK AT SOME OF THE PROCEEDING PROCEEDINGS WE HAVE NOW THAT THAT THAT ARE OPEN FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. THE INFORMATION MATE MAY INDEED NOT BE AS FRESH AS WE WOULD LIKE IT. AND MADE MAYBE. THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO GET MORE YOU KNOW IN A MORE TIMELY MANNER BUT I STILL THINK THAT INFORMATION IS WOULD BE REALLY VALUABLE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO ENSURE IT LIKE I SAID THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING. THE SAME QUALITY OF SERVICE THAT THEY ONCE HAD AND OR BETTER. AND AND I THINK THAT. THIS IS ONE WAY TO. BRING THAT TO THE LEGISLATURE'S INTENT ATTENTION AND ENSURE THAT THAT'S HAPPENING. I I THINK WE ALL SHARE THAT GOAL AND I. PERSONALLY WOULD LOVE TO HAVE MORE VISIBILITY MORE LIGHT SHED ON THE TOPIC JUST NOT SURE THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT VEHICLE FOR THE REASONS THAT THAT WERE BROUGHT UP AND I'VE AND I AND I PLEDGE AND AND AND THE THE. OPPOSITION IS ALSO PLEDGED TO WORK WITH ME TOO TO FINE TUNE AND AND AND COME TO A SOLUTION ON THIS AND. YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS THE FIRST POLICY COMMITTEE. NOT EVERY BILL IS PERFECT AT LEAVING THIS FIRST POLICY COMMITTEE BUT I BUT I BELIEVE THIS INFORMATION IS APTLY CRITICAL TO CONSUMERS. AND NOT JUST CONSUMERS BUT ALSO TO UP OUR EMERGENCY RESPONDERS. ARE ARE ARE AGENCIES I THINK OUR SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT IN HUMBLE COUNTY WOULD KINDA LIKE TO KNOW. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. AND WHY WHY A FIRE IN IN THE NEIGHBORING COUNTY WIPED OUT OUR SERVICE IN THE AND CAUSED US TO HAVE TO DECLARE A STATE OF EMERGENCY. WILL ALSO COME LIKE TO KNOW WHY AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY GOT WIPED OUT WE DON'T HAVE THE RESILIENCY IN OUR COMMUNITIES WE DON'T HAVE THE REDUNDANCY IN THE NORTH COAST. THAT SOME OTHER AREAS ENJOY SO WHEN PART OF A LINE GOES OUT OF IT WIPES IT WIPES OUT ENTIRE COUNTIES AND IT'S SO IT'S NOT JUST. NOT JUST THE FIRE ARM WITH WE HAVE FLOODS WE HAVE OTHER KINDS OF EMERGENCIES WE DON'T HAVE THAT REDUNDANCY SO SO IN SOME AREAS AND IN LARGER URBAN AREAS A PART OF IT A PART OF A LINE WILL GO OUT. AND THEY'LL STILL HAVE SERVICE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN FOR US IN THESE IN THESE RURAL AREAS AND WE'RE GETTING BETTER AND AND I WILL SAY THAT. THAT CERTAINLY I KNOW THAT. THAT EIGHTEEN T. N. AND FRONTIER HAVE BEEN INVESTING A LOT OF MONEY. TO UPGRADE SERVICES BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET AND WE NEED TO BE. LOOKING UP FOR FOR A CONCERT. WELL IT SOUNDS LIKE LOOK LET ME JUST CHECK IF THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL MEMBERS OF QUESTIONS. IT IT IF I AUDIT OVER I'LL JUST WRAP UP BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE WE HAVE THE SAME GOAL ACCOUNT. I HAVE TO BE A NO TODAY I WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU TO GET THE BILL TO A PLACE WHERE I CAN BE A YES. FOR BECAUSE A AYE I THINK IT'S IT'S A LOT OF WILL GOAL THAT YOU HAVE.
