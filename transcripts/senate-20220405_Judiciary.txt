SPILLS ABOUT THE- HORRIBLE EPIDEMIC OF GUN VIOLENCE. TODAY'S EDITORIAL TOP EDITORIAL THE LOS ANGELES TIME REACH. THE NATION'S SECOND TOLL OF GUN LINE GUN VIOLENCE WHICH MADE CLEAR AGAIN HERE THIS WEEKEND. ON THE SAME DAY THE EDITORIAL SAYS THE SAME THIS IS% REFERRED SHOOTING AT LEAST NINETY FIVE OTHER SHOOTINGS TOOK PLACE ACROSS THE NATION. I SAY THAT AGAIN IT WAS A THING NINETY FIVE SHOOTINGS ON THE SAME DAY IN APRIL CLAIMING THIRTY SIX MORE LIVES AND INJURING NINETY FIVE MORE PEOPLE. JUST ON THIS ONE SUNDAY IN APRIL. GUN VIOLENCE HAS EXPLODED IN OUR COMMUNITIES OF THE LAST YEARS FEW YEARS MUCH OF INCREASED VIOLENCE COME FROM THE USE OF ILLEGAL WEAPONS. THE SO CALLED GHOST GUNS AND ASSAULT WEAPONS AREN'T TO BLAMEIN LARGE BETS AND WHAT'S A GHOST KIND OF GOES GOING TO SOME DEGREE BY THREE D. PRINTED OFF THE INTERNET OR IT'S LITERALLY. IN A WEAPON THAT'S REQUIRED TO HAVE NUMBER AND FILING THE SERIAL NUMBER OFF OF THE WEAPON WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF FILING A SERIAL NUMBER OFF OF YOUR WEAPON IF YOU'RE GONNA GO DEER HUNTING OR IF YOU NEED YOUR HOME TO PROTECT YOURSELF FOR TO PROTECT YOUR BUSINESS. THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT WHERE I LIVE RECENTLY DECLARED GHOST GUNS EPIDEMIC THEY SAID AS OF OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND ONE THE LOS ANGELES POLICE COMMISSION REPORTED REPORTEDLY FOUND THAT THE NUMBER OF GHOST GUNS CONFISCATED BY THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT. JUMPED BY FOUR HUNDRED. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. DISTRICT ELEVEN CIVIC CENTER ONE. THE LOS ANGELES POLICE TO. SAUDI EVAN LOW RIDE. COMPARED TO THE PE YEARS. UP SEVEN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTY GHOST GUNS CONFISCATED COMPARED ONLY EITHER THIRTEEN TAKEN IN TWENTY TWENTY OAKLAND TWENTY THREE PERCENT. OF THE OF THE TWELVE HUNDRED FIREARMS SEIZED GHOST GUNS LAST YEAR SAN FRANCISCO SHE'S A HUNDRED NINETY FOUR GHOST GUNS. COUNTY 420% OF ALL THE GUNS SEIZED IN SAN FRANCISCO ALL ACROSS THE STATE. TO THAT QUESTION. CALIFORNIA LEADS THE NATION IN ACTING ROBUST GUN LAWS. I DIDN'T COUNT THE NUMBERS FOR THE LOS ANGELES TIMES REPORTED THIS MORNING THAT THE HUNDRED SEVEN LOSS IN CALIFORNIA WE PASSED. AND WE'RE STILL SEEING. THIS UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL OF GUN VIOLENCE GOVERNOR NEWSOM. MEMBERS HIS FIERCE LEADER IN COMMONSENSE GUN REFORM THAT HE SIGNED IN MULTIPLE NUMBER OF THESE GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION MEASURES INTO LAW THAT I JUST REFERRED TO. YET THE TRAGIC EVENTS. DISTURBING NUMBERS OF REPORTING OUT OF OUR POLICE DEPARTMENTS DEMONSTRATE THAT THERE'S STILL MUCH TO BE DONE AND WE NEED TO BE CREATIVE. UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF GOVERNOR NEWSOM HIS ADMINISTRATION THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES. S. B. THIRTEEN TWENTY SEVEN PROVIDES A SET OF NEW TOOLS INCENTIVES IF YOU WILL TO GET THESE DANGEROUS WEAPONS OFF THE STREET A PRIVATE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM. THINK ABOUT IT A MINUTE IT'S A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION WHAT DOES THAT MEAN WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT AN ORDINARY PERSON IN THE COMMUNITY CAN BRING A LAWSUIT AND COLLECT UP TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PLUS ATTORNEY'S FEES OF SOMEONE MANUFACTURES WORK TRANSPORTS. ARE ANY ANY WEAPONS. ST LOUIS TRANCE. IN POOR SOMEBODY'S TO OUT OF STATE BRINGS IN A BUNCH OF. THEY CAN BRING AN ACTION TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER. NOW THE BOTTOM LINE AND THE QUESTION IS WILL IT WORK I DON'T KNOW. BUT IF IT SAVES ONE COAST GUARD IF IT SAVES ONE ASSAULT WEAPON THAT CAN BE USED IN A CRIME WITH THE NUMBERS WE SEEN. HIM PULL THE NEW WHICH YOU. IF WHEN SOMEBODY DOES THIS AND BRINGS DEPRESSED GONNA RIP AND GOING TO BE A STORY AND I'M HOPING THAT IT HAS A CHILLING EFFECT ON OTHERS WHO THINK THAT THEY'RE GOING TO USE THESE WEAPONS IN CRIMES WHICH WE SEEN CLICK RATE AT EXTRAORDINARY LEVEL SO THIS BILL HARNESSES THE POWER OF COMMUNITY A MEASURE OF DETERRENCE WE DO THIS IN MANY OTHER WAYS WE DO IT THE SIMPLE FORM OF PUTTING SOMEONE'S PICTURE UP IN THE POST OFFICE. POSTED EIGHT HUNDRED. SACRAMENTO POLICE DEPARTMENT TALKED ABOUT COMMUNITY EVIDENCE OVER A HUNDRED PEOPLE COMMITTEE HAD VIDEOS COMMUNITY EVIDENCE COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF WHAT WE DO AS ANOTHER TOOL TO TRY TO COMBAT THIS EXTRAORDINARY GUN VIOLENCE OWNERS SAY THAT A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION WHICH I HAVE NOT ALWAYS SUPPORT IN OTHER INSTANCES IT'S NOT NEW IN CALIFORNIA YAHOO CIVIL RIGHTS ACT CIVIL CODE SECTION FIFTY ONE OF THE- CODES ALLOWS IT AGREE PERSON TO PURSUE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION FOR ACCOMMODATION SAME THING WITH RESPECT AMERICANS WITH DISABILITY ACT THERE'S A WHOLE HOST OF ISSUES AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ALIVE. IT PROVIDES THIS TO REMEDY IT DITION TO THE OTHER REMEDIES THAT WE DO IN THE LAW NOW. TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE TEXAS STATE LEGISLATURE. DEBASE PRIVATE AND FOR SKI AND THAT IN THE- BUT AGREE. ABORTION IN WHAT WAS KNOWN THEN AS S. B. EIGHT WHICH ALLOWS ALMOST ANYONE ANYONE TO PURCHASE TO PROVIDERS WHO AIDS AND ABETS A PERSON OBTAINING. AN ABORTION. IF TEXAS CAN USE THIS MECHANISM TO TAKE AWAY A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE AN ENDANGER LIVES CALIFORNIA COULD USE THE SAME MECHANISM TO. ANYTHING CREATIVE TO BAN DEADLY WEAPONS OF WAR AND SAVE LIVES- THE SUPREME COURT DISALLOWED SP EIGHT TO REMAIN IN PLACE SO WHAT DID WE DO WE SAT DOWN AND WE LOOKED AT THE COURT AND WHAT THE SUPREME COURT SAYS UNFORTUNATELY. IN THIS COUNTRY THE COST SAYS WITH TO PRINT COURTS AS IT IS AND SO WHAT WE DID IS WE CRAFTED THIS LAW VERY CAREFULLY. WITH RESPECT TO THE GUIDANCE THAT WAS GIVEN OUT OF S. B. EIGHT WE'VE PUT SOME OTHER PROTECTIONS IN THAT I WILL ADDRESS IN RESPONSE TO SOME QUESTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE ISSUE OF KNOWING. FIRST IS JUST RECOGNIZE IT IF IT. USUAL RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS IT CERTAINLY DOES NOT. OCCUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO OWN MANUFACTURERS SELL ILLEGAL ASSAULT WEAPONS WERE GHOST GUN IT'S NOT THERE'S NO CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO MANUFACTURE AN ILLEGAL WEAPON. WE'RE NOT TRYING TO TELL PEOPLE WHO WANT TO PROTECT THEIR HOMES TO PROTECT THEIR BUSINESSES OR GO HUNTING OR WHATEVER THERE'S NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM. THIS LAW ONLY APPLIES TO VS FIFTY CALIBER MACHINE GUN IF YOU GOT AN ASSAULT WEAPON THAT REVERDY IN ROOST PUT OUT AND DATE AND PRADA DID IN EIGHTY NINE AND NINETY NINE. THOSE HAVE BEEN DECLARED ILLEGAL THE SUPREME COURT THE COURT OF APPEALS UPHELD THAT AND SO WE'RE SAYING IF IT'S ILLEGAL ORDINAL FOR DISH NEW MECHANISM THIS NEW DEVICE. IN ORDER TO I TRY ANYTHING WE POSSIBLY CAN CREATIVE AND IMAGINATIVE USER. ALL AVAILABLE TO TRY TO REDUCE THIS EXTRAORDINARY IN HORRIBLE EPIDEMIC OF GUN VIOLENCE SO IT MAY NOT BE THE PERFECT SOLUTION MEMBERS BUT IT DOES I SUGGEST OFFER A CREATIVE TOOL THAT'S NEVER BEEN USED OR TESTED BEFORE. SO WITH THAT I WANT TO TURN THIS OVER TO MY WITNESS A CRYSTAL- LOW PALATO OF THE MOMS DEMAND ACTION FOR GUN SENSE WHO'S GOING TO TESTIFY IN FAVOR OF THIS MEASURE MISTER CHAIRED MEMBERS THANK YOU BOB MISS LOCK OUT THE ONE ONE SECOND HERE BEFORE YOU BEGIN YOUR TESTIMONY- DUE TO CONSTRAINTS- REGARDING LENGTH OF HEARINGS TECHNOLOGY CONSIDERATIONS AND CLEANING PROTOCOLS I'VE INSTITUTED TIME LIMITS ON TESTIMONY. EACH SIDE WILL BE PERMITTED TO WITNESSES WILL BE ALLOWED TO SPEAK FOR TWO MINUTES EACH. ALL OF THOSE WISHING TO TESTIFY MUST LIMIT THEIR COMMENTS TO THEIR NAME. THEIR AFFILIATION AND THEIR POSITION ON THE MEASURE- SO LET ME REPEAT THAT TWO MINUTES. PER WITNESS TO WITNESSES EACH SIDE. AND THOSE WHO ARE CALLING IN TO EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT THEIR NAME THEIR AFFILIATION IN THEIR POSITION SO- WITH THAT MISS OUT. LOPILATO THE CLASSIC CORRECT AND YOU DID EIGHT GO AHEAD OF ME. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS CRYSTAL LOPILATO I'M A MOM LIVING IN THE BAY AREA AND I'M A VOLUNTEER LEADER WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF MOMS DEMAND ACTION FOR GUN SENSE. IN THAT ROLE I CONNECT WITH PARENTS AND PEOPLE ALL AROUND THE STATE WHO WANT TO SEE CALIFORNIA LEAD THE WAY ON GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION. SACRAMENTO MORIN'S ONE OF THE DEADLIEST SHOOTINGS IN THE U. S. THIS YEAR. I FIRST WANT TO EXPRESS MY SOLIDARITY AND SUPPORT FOR THE COMMUNITY AND EVERYONE HERE THAT WAS IMPACTED. I STARTED VOLUNTEERING WITH MOMS DEMAND ATION BECAUSE I WAS SICK OF FEELING HELPLESS. EVERY TIME I SAW NEWS OF A SCHOOL SHOOTING OR MASS SHOOTING. AND EVERY TIME I TALKED TO GRIEVING FAMILIES WHOSE LOVED ONES HAVE BEEN TAKEN BY GUN VIOLENCE. I KNOW YOU'VE ALL SEEN OR EXPERIENCED THE IMPACT OF GUN VIOLENCE IN YOUR DISTRICTS OR RIGHT HERE WHERE YOU WORK. AND FELT THAT SINKING FEELING OF WHAT CAN WE POSSIBLY DO TO STOP THIS. AND THE ANSWER IS WE HAVE TO USE EVERY TOOL WE CAN TO END GUN VIOLENCE IN OUR STATE. SB THIRTEEN TWENTY SEVEN BRINGS US A NEW TOOL IN THIS FIGHT. THE ABILITY OF INDIVIDUALS TO BRING CIVIL LAWSUITS TO RID OUR COMMUNITIES OF LEGAL ASSAULT WEAPONS AND GHOST GUNS. UNBOUNCE IS ON THE RISE IN CITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND THE RIPPLE EFECTIVIDAD. HIDE AS WE WATCHED FAMILIES BEING TORN APART BY GRIEF AND FEAR. WE CAN'T SIT BACK AND HOPE THAT THE PEOPLE BRINGING THESE WEAPONS OF WAR INTO OUR STATE WILL CERTAINLY CHOOSE TO STOP. THIS BILL OPENS UP ANOTHER LANE TO PROACTIVELY ENFORCE PROHIBITIONS ON A LEGAL ASSAULT WEAPONS AND GHOST GUNS BEFORE THEY CAUSE INJURY DEATH OR TRAUMA IN OUR COMMUNITIES. CALIFORNIA LAW ALREADY MAKES IT A FELONY TO MANUFACTURE DISTRIBUTE OR IMPORT ASSAULT WEAPONS WE ALSO ALREADY HAVE A LAW REGULATING THE SALE OF FIREARM PRECURSOR PARTS GO INTO EFFECT IN JULY. BUT EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE THE STRONG LAWS WE NEED BOLDER ACTION TO TRULY AND THE PROLIFERATION OF THOSE WEAPONS. THIS BILL GIVES US ANOTHER WAY TO BE SURE INDIVIDUALS AND COMPANIES WHO CONTINUE TO DEFY OUR LAWS BY BRINGING THESE WEAPONS INTO OUR STATE ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB THIRTEEN TWENTY SEVEN THANK YOU.

BUT THIS WOULD BE IN DIRECT CONTRADICTION OF A FEDERAL LAW WHICH OVERSEES THIS PARTICULAR.

B. THIRTEEN TWENTY SEVEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. BRING IT BACK NOW TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS- CENTER THE RUSSELL THANK YOU- YOU KNOW ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU RAISE I'M TOTALING COMPLETELY IN AGREEMENT WITH YOU I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT. IT SAYS HERE AND I CAN GIVE YOU THE EXACT- PLACE BUT IT SAYS IF YOU KNOWINGLY pABETS A VIOLATION REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE PERSON KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN. THAT THE PERSON AIDED OR ABETTED WOULD BE VIOLATING THE OF THE VILE THE SECTION- I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT- IN TERMS OF. NOT KNOWING BUT BEING HELD- RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT OF SOMEONE ELSE. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. EXTENSION OF LIABILITY GOING BEYOND THE PERSON WHO COMMITTED THE VIOLATION- BEING ACCUSED OF COMMITTING THE VIOLATION SO IF YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT. YEAH I THINK WE READ IT IN ITS TOTALITY CERTAINLY ARE I WAS QUITE SENSITIVE- IN WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ON THIS AND THEY WERE AS WELL. BUT SIR BECAUSE WE'VE HAD SOME CHALLENGES WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW IN TEXAS RIGHT. SO THEY DON'T HAVE A KNOWING STANDARD AND TO ME WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS IT SAYS UNDERTAKEN SPACE. YOU'RE READING FROM LOT B. ONE FORTY IT SAYS ANY PERSON. MAY BRING A CIVIL ACTION WHO DOES THE FOLLOWING ONE KNOWINGLY VIOLATES THIS SECTION TWO IF YOU COULD KNOWINGLY ENGAGES RIGHT TEXAS DOESN'T USE THE KNOWINGLY ENGAGES STAND I SEE IS SOMEWHAT CONFUSING BUT THEN. KNOWINGLY COMMITS AN ACT WITH INTENT TO ENGAGE IN THE CONDUCT UNDER ONE OR TWO WHICH IS ABOVE SO MY SENSE IS THAT. WOULD WHAT WAS OUR INTENT IS TO CREATE A KNOWING STANDARD TO AVOID THE SITUATION WHERE YOU HAD OVER DRIVER SAY HAD YOU KNOW THIS IS AGAINST WHAT TRANSPORT SO LET'S ASSUME A TAXI DRIVER IS DRIVING SOMEBODY LESSEN ASSAULT WEAPON IN THEIR BACKYARD IN THE BACK OF THE CARD THAT. GETS PULLED OVER BY THE POLICE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU SEE THAT ASSAULT WEAPON AND THEN THEN THAT'S THE TAXI DRIVER GETS CHARGED BECAUSE THEY'RE TRANSPORTING WHAT YOU WE SET THE KNOWING STAND IN THERE SO I GET YOUR POINT TO EXTEND YOU SEE FURTHER CLARIFIED HAPPY TO DO IT THAT'S THE UNDERLYING IDEA. THE PURPOSE OF THIS WASN'T DO WHAT HAPPENED IN TEXAS WHERE YOU HAD A TAXI. DRIVER TOOK SOMEBODY. WORST OF A SUDDEN WHICH CHARGE SO WE WANT TO GO CLEAR. WITH WHICH TO THAT IF THERE'S ANY. BE TO WORK FOR WITH YOU ON OVER THAT'S THAT'S THE UNDERLYING REASON WHY WE PUT KNOWINGLY WHICH IS NOT IN SB EIGHT. THANK YOU ONE MORE QUESTION CORSET FOR THE AUTHOR- THERE IS LANGUAGE IN THEIR NICE. LOOKING FOR IT- THE SAYS THAT A DEFENDANT COULD BE SUED OUT REPEATEDLY- IN THE STATE OF FOR THE SAME CONTACT EVEN IF. HERE SHE HAS SUCCEEDED IN DEFENDING THEMSELVES AGAINST THE SAME CLAIMS- SO I JUST YOU KNOW A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT CONCERN ME AND I HOPE. WE CAN GET FROM YOU TO KEEP ON WORKING ON MAKING THIS LIKE THE KIND OF BILL THAT DOESN'T- VIOLATE OTHER CIVIL RIGHTS THAT WE HAVE FOUGHT FOR SO LONG AND I KNOW. YOU HAVE TO- BUT- THEY GET CAUGHT UP IN THIS AND UNFORTUNATELY SOMETHING THAT GETS DEVISED IN TEXAS. OF RATE IS AND I KNOW IT'S BEEN UPHELD BUT THAT'S NOT EXACTLY LIKE THE BEST MODEL IN MY MIND POLITICALLY- FOR WHAT WE HAVE STOOD FOR IN IN CALIFORNIA SO IT'S GOING TO BRING THOSE TO YOUR TENSION AND I HOPE THEY GET. ADDRESSED AND- TODAY I WILL SUPPORT BUT KEEPING ALL THOSE. QUESTIONS AND MINE FOR OBSERVATIONS- YOU SEE THAT'S THE PURPOSE AND INTENT WE ARE. THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF HAVING MORE THAN ONE COMMITTEE THIS ISN'T THAT COMMITTEE HOLDS THE PURPOSE OF THE PROCESS SO HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON IT WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR WITH A LOT OF. LAWYERS ON THIS AND IT'S A CHALLENGE BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE RIGHT I MEAN YOU RAISE A REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE WE'RE TRYING TO. GET WITH THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE SUPREME COURT DECISION RIGHT AND YET DO WITH THE MORE INTELLIGENT WAY BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY ASSUMING SOMEONE BRING. SAID THAT ACTION TO CHALLENGE THIS. AT THIS CAL. LAW WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO. TO PUT THE COURT IN A IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY'RE THEY'RE HELD. TO ACCOUNT AND I JUST SAY ONE THING A CENTER SIX IMPORTANT IN THIS REGARD. AND I KIND OF TIE THIS INTO MY CLOTHES AND ANSWER QUESTIONS IS. YOU KNOW WHEN WE DID THE RESEARCH ON LOOKING AT THE- BRIEFS THAT WERE FILED BEFORE THE COURT. BY FOR THE NC SUPREME COURT THERE IS A- A BRIEF FILED BY THE FIREARMS POLICY INSTITUTE CAN'T MAYBE HAVE IT OFF. BUT BASICALLY THE IDEA WAS THEY BROGHT A CAKE THEY BROUGHT IN TO MAKE HIS CASE A COURT AND SAID LOOK. IF THIS APPLIES TO ABORTION. THE NEXT THING IS GOING TO APPLY TO GUNS AND SO THE ARGUMENT WELL THE SUPREME COURT WASN'T AWARE OF THIS THEY HAD A BRIEF AN ARGUMENT THAT WAS QUITE BRILLIANT. IN TERMS OF MAKING THIS ARGUMENT AND THE COURT REJECTED IT SO I THINK IT GAVE US A LITTLE BIT MORE STRENGTH IN THAT REGARD. SIR WHITE HOUSE. THANK YOU SANDRA WAS AND WHAT BECAUSE HE THE THAT GETS ABSENT QUESTION THE I THINK THE STAFF REPORTER PAGE THIRTEEN TALKS ABOUT. AN UNUSUAL- THE VENUE- CONDITIONS ON THE ON THIS BILL THAT. IS SHE'S MY COLLEAGUE INDICATED. INVALIDATED INVALIDATES NON MUTUAL ISSUE. PRECLUSION AND NON MUTUAL CLAIM PRECLUSION. AS DEFENSES IN ACTIONS BROUGHT PURSUANT TO THE BILL THIS BILL WHICH MEANS THAT. YOU WOULD HAVE OF. A VARIETY OF. SIM IDENTICAL CLAIMS IN DIFFERENT COURTHOUSES THROUGHOUT- THROUGHOUT THE STATE- WHAT YOU'RE THINKING ON TECH AS A QUICK PROCESS. SPECIFICALLY ARE SLAPPED PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW FOR MOTIONS TO STRIKE. THAT DO WHAT TEXAS THEATER JUST SLIPPING I'M NOT CAMERA TEXTED IS TO BE A TEXAS ADDITION THE CHALLENGES WITH THIS LET'S ASSUME SOMEONE WAS IN COUNTY A. COUNTY BEING COUNTY SEE AND HAD. SOUGHT WEAPONS RIGHT AND SAY CENTER NUMBER IN ORANGE COUNTY AND YOU KNOW THE SENATE ACCOUNT SKIP IN FREMONT AND CENTER LAYERED OVER THERE AND SANTA CRUZ ONE TO BRING AN ACTION. TO BE THREE ACTIONS IT'S A PRETTY TOUGH STANDARD I GET THAT BUT AS WE GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS WILL DRILL DOWN THROUGH IT BUT IT IS IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE DID THE MODEL AFTER TEXAS. BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO CREATE THE GREATEST TELLING AFFECTED WE POSSIBLY CAN FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE THESE ILLEGAL. WEAPONS HAVE NO CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS HAVE. THANK CENTER INTO YOUR ON THIS. SINISTER THANK YOU MR AND- THE POOR THE AUTHOR. FOR STEPPING INTO THE BREACH HERE IN. GOING THROUGH- THE BORDERLINE SHOOTING IN THOUSAND OAKS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WAS A. AND CHANGE MY LIFE AND WAS VERY HARD. PLACE TO BE A PUBLIC REPRESENTATIVE WHEN KILLED- WITH WEAPONS THAT SHOULDN'T BE HERE. AND TO TRY TO MAKE SENSE OF ALL THAT IS SORT OF IMPOSSIBLE AND NO BILLS EVER GOING TO DO THAT SO FOR ALL THE VICTIMS- AND ALL THE ADVOCATES WHO'VE BEEN FIGHTING. I APPRECIATE YOUR HUMILITY ABOUT WHAT THIS ANY BILL CAN DO OR NOT DO- BUT I THINK THIS BILL IS COMPLETELY NECESSARY- THANK TIMELY AND I THINK THE ANALYSIS AND THE AUTHOR MAKE STRONG ARGUMENTS FOR. THE- THE STATUTORY BASIS FOR THIS I THINK WE CANWE CAN OVERCOME WHATEVER- CLAIM PRECLUSION ISSUES OR OR PREEMPTION ISSUES MIGHT BE PRESENTED IN FEDERAL SATUTE THEY GIVE NEARLY TAYLOR TO THE POTENTIAL DEFENDANT I THINK THERE'S SOME OTHER ELEMENTS IN HERE THAT THE MAKERS LEGALLY DEFENSIBLE THE ONE QUESTION I DO WANT TO RAISE THOUGH IS. THE GENESIS HERE IS THE CHAIR- I THINK YOU OUGHT TO MENTION. FROM THIS AWFUL TEXAS DECISION. ARE WE ARE WE PACKING OURSELVES TO THAT DECISION IN OTHER WORDS IF WE IF THE FUTURE COURT IS ABLE TO OVERTURN. THAT UP HOLDINGOF THE TEXAS ABORTION BAN WHICH I THINK WAS A HARD DECISION AND FRANKLY- I MISREAD A CONSTITUTION. OF THE- YOU KNOW THE SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS RIGHTS THAT PEOPLE HAVE ON THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT AND A NUMBER OF OTHER- IMPLIED AND SUBSTANTIVE RIGHTS SO HOW HOW MUCH ARE WE- HOW MUCH OF OUR STATE OUR STRATEGY HERE SORT OF BOUND UP WITH THAT SUPREME COURT DECISION AND- IF IT WERE OVERTURNED WOULD WE- WILL WE LOSE FOOTING HERE IN UP HOLDING THIS LAW OR DO YOU THINK THERE'S AN INDEPENDENT. BASIS TO SORT OF ARGUE THIS BEFORE THE COURT AND GET A WIN AT THE SUPREME COURT WHERE THIS CHALLENGED WITHOUT. AFFIRMING WHAT I VIEW IS THAT PRESIDENT. I THINK THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION SIR I THINK THAT THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS. FOR LEGISLATORS COULD DO WHATEVER THEY WANT RIGHT AND IT WOULD BE KIND OF NICE IN A CERTAIN SENSE BECAUSE IT WOULD BE IN TERMS OF THE SUPREME COURT CHANGED OPINION. OF WE'VE SEEN THIS YEAR'S COMPETITION THROUGH COURT MAKES A DECISION AND THAT'S THE LAW UNTIL THE NEXT. GROUP OF JUSTICES. OVERTURNING RIGHT SEPARATE BUT EQUAL WAS LEGAL UNTIL BROWN VERSUS BOARD OF EDUCATION CAME AROUND. EXAMPLE AFTER EXAMPLE OF THOSE KINDS OF THINGS BUT CERTAINLY WE COULD DO THAT HOWEVER I WOULD SIX FACT. THAT GIVING PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION BECAUSE UNLIKE. IT PORTION ISSUE WHERE THERE'S A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. AND THERE'S AN ARGUMENT ABOUT THAT. I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO HAVE IT SOUGHT WEAPON. RIGHT THE FOLKS HERE THAT ARE LEGAL GUN OWNERS I RESPECT. GREATLY I LOVE THE FACT THAT- THEY TALKED ABOUT BEING A LEGAL OWNERS MISTER HARPER WHO'S HERE TODAY. AND THE LIKE WITH THERE'S NOTHING HERE ABOUT THE ILL ABOUT LEGAL DIAL WHICH WE DON'T TOUCH LEGAL GUN OWNERS THEY CAN DO WHATEVER THEY WANT. WE DON'T BURDEN THEM WE DON'T TELL THEM HOW MUCH AMMUNITION THEY CAN HAVE WE DON'T TELL THEM THEY'VE GOT TO USE A GUN SAFE WE DON'T TELL THEM ABOUT ANY OF THOSE THINGS IT DOESN'T. REGISTRATION GETTING PASSED OVER WE JUST DEAL WITH THIS VERY NARROW BAND OF ILLEGAL WEAPONS FIFTY CALIBER MACHINE GUNS ASSAULT WEAPONS AND GHOST GUNS. AND JUST TO ANSWER IT'S ENOUGH TO PUT IN THE CLUBS- THE- QUESTION. IS REFERENCED. ABOUT THE IN THE TESTIMONY. I'D GO RUNS WAS ONE I THINK THE STANDARD THAT THAT THAT- TALK. I'M A BUT KNOWING SOLVE THAT PROBLEM THE SECOND THERE'S A MEASURE BEFORE THE SLOW AB SIX TWENTY ONE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER GIPSON TO BASICALLY CLOSE THE BALANCE OF ANY LOOPHOLES WITH RESPECT TO GHOST GUNS THAT WAS MET MENTIONED BY THE INDIVIDUAL TESTIFIED SO I THINK THAT GIVES US FLEXIBILITY HE BE INSTINCTIVE% TO REVISIT THAT CERTAINLY WOULD BE NICE BECAUSE MAYBE WE CAN FIX THE THEIR OPINION WITH RESPECT TO HOW IT RIDICULOUS OPINION ABORTIONS. BUT JUST TO PUT A FINER POINT AT THIS POINT WE ARE DEPENDENT YES LEGALLY ON THAT DECISION YEAH OKAY. THAT'S CORRECT THANK YOU SIR. ALL RIGHT OF SAYING NO OTHER QUESTIONS- THANK YOU CENTERS FOR BEFORE YOU CLOSE- THANK YOU THIS THE BILL HAS TO LAUDABLE GOALS ONE IS TO PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL- IN CREATIVE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM AS TO. ENFORCING CURRENTLY EXISTING GUN LAWS IN CALIFORNIA AND SECONDLY IS THE HIGHLIGHT THE ABSURDITY OF THE- SLAUGHTER I'M GRATEFUL THAT YOU PROVISION IN THE IN THE BILL. THAT ACTUALLY. BASICALLY VOIDS ARE LAW SHOULD RIGHT THE COURT ULTIMATELY DECIDES THE TEXAS AND FORCE A MECHANISM IS. CRAZY THAT'S RIGHT- IN AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT THAT THERE WILL BE A FINDING THAT THE TEXAS ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM IS CRAZY- THE CHALLENGE OF COURSE IS THAT. WE'RE WE'RE SORT OF TWO MINDS HERE WHERE. WE AT LEAST ME AND I THINK YOU JOIN ME CENTER HERTZBERG AND HOPING THAT THE TEXAS LAWS FOUND TO BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL- IN THE US VOIDING THE LAW THAT MAY BE PASSED ON THIS COMMITTEE TODAY- HAVING SAID THAT I'M I'M GOING TO SUPPORT IT. BUT IT IS MY HOPE AND DESIRE THAT THAT ULTIMATELY THIS BILL ACTUALLY NOT PROCEED- BECAUSE THE TEXAS LAW IS FOUND TO BE WRONG ON CONSTITUTIONAL AND CRAZY THIS IS SORT OF COMES UNDER THE MONKEY SEE MONKEY DO RUBRIC- AND- HOPEFULLY WE WON'T BE DOING THE MONKEY SEE MONKEY DO THINGS. ALL THE WAY TILL THE HAVING SAID THAT IS OUR MOTION SOME OF THE SENATOR WHITE HOUSE CAN MOVE THE BILL. K. BRIEFLY. YES I JUST WANT TO KIND OF BREAK A FINER POINT WHICH CENTERS CHANGED IN WOULD YOU SAID OF COURSE THAT'S THE CASE BUT WHEN THE SITUATION HERE WHAT WHAT IF IT TURNS OUT WHEN THIS IS GOING TO LITIGATION PROCESSES WHOM IT DOES IT WORKS THAT IT HAS A CHILLING EFFECT THAT IS A CONSEQUENCE IT HELPS GETTING SOME GUNS OFF THE STREET WHICH THAT MIGHT HELP THESE ILLEGAL GUNS MIGHT HELP PREVENT CERTAIN KINDS OF THESE HORRIBLE TRAGEDIES RIGHT SO THERE MIGHT BE A SILVER LINING WE MIGHT IN FUTURE LEGISLATURES MIGHT WANT TO COME BACK.

LIKELY INTENDED AT THE OUTSET. ALL RIGHT SO- CENTER LEYVA S. B. ELEVEN FORTY NINE. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS I WANT TO FIRST THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK WITH MY OFFICE ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT BILL I WILL BE IT- ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS RELATED. TO THIRD PARTIES ON PAGE SEVEN OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS MEMBERS SENATE BILL ELEVEN FORTY NINE ALSO KNOWN AS THE PUBLIC RIGHT TO KNOW ACT WOULD PROHIBIT FACTUAL INFORMATION ABOUT DANGEROUS PUBLIC HAZARDS. FROM BEING HIDDEN FROM THE PUBLIC THROUGH OVERLY BROAD COURT PROTECTIVE ORDERS AND AGREEMENTS TO KEEP INFORMATION ABOUT DANGERS A SECRET. IN AN OPEN SOCIETY OUR COURT RECORDS ARE PRESUMPTIVELY OPEN TO PUBLIC INSPECTION. EVEN IN A DISPUTE BETWEEN PRIVATE PARTIES THE COURTS RESOLUTION OF THAT DISPUTE AS A MATTER OF PUBLIC INTEREST. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE WHEN THE CASE INVOLVES A PUBLIC DANGER SUCH AS A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT BOARD OF OUR MENTAL HEALTH SOARED. OR THREE PRE REPEAT ISSUE OVER BROUGHT. ORDERS THE KEEP DISCOVERY INFORMATION SECRET AND PROTECT INCRIMINATING DOCUMENTS. AND LAWYERS MUTUALLY AGREED TO SETTLEMENTS AND STUFF STIPULATED ORDERS THAT PROHIBIT DISCLOSING THE VERY FACTS THAT PROMPTED THE CASE. SECRECY IS SOMETIMES NECESSARY TO PROTECT PERSONAL INFORMATION OR LEGITIMATE TRADE SECRETS BUT IT IS GROSSLY INAPPROPRIATE WHEN IT CLEARLY KEEPS INFORMATION ABOUT ONGOING DANGERS FROM THE PUBLIC. WHICH IN A VERY REAL WAY CAN AND DOES THREATEN THEIR HEALTH SAFETY AND EVEN THEIR LIVES. IF SIGNED CALIFORNIA WE'RE JOINED SEVERAL OTHER STATES THAT HAVE ENACTED SEVERAL ANTI SECRECY LAWS. INCLUDING FLORIDA LOUISIANA MONTANA SOUTH CAROLINA AND WASHINGTON. WITNESSES WITH ME TODAY WILL SURE EXACTLY WHY THIS IS CRITICAL BUT I JUST WANT TO MENTION A COUPLE OF QUICK EXAMPLES TO HIGHLIGHT THE NEED FOR SB ELEVEN FORTY NINE. IN THE CASE OF PURDUE PHARMA THE COMPANY TOLD OUTRIGHT LIES FOR MANY YEARS REGARDING SAFE DOSAGE LEVELS AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADDICTION FROM OXY COTTON. WHICH ULTIMATELY KILLED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. THESE TRAGEDIES THAT TOUCH FAR TOO MANY FAT. FOR NOW AND THE NEW. WAS LAW ENABLED THROUGH CAP COURT SECRECY AND THE VERY TACTICS THAT THIS BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS IN THE CASE OF THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN BALCONY COLLAPSE AT A BIRTHDAY PARTY IN BERKELEY SEVEN PEOPLE DIED AS A RESULT OF THAT TRAGEDY WHAT THE PARTY GOERS AND EVEN STATE REGULARS DID NOT KNOW REGULATORS DID NOT KNOW WAS THAT THE CONSTRUCTION COMPANY WHO BUILT THE COMPLEX HAD PAID OVER TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN SETTLEMENTS IN EARLY DEFECT CASES. BUT THE INFORMATION ABOUT THOSE CASES REMAIN SHIELDED AS YOU MAY REMEMBER MANY OF YOU WERE HERE THE YOUNG WOMAN WHO INITIALLY SURVIVED THE COLLAPSE ACTUALLY TRAVELED TO SACRAMENTO IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN TO TESTIFY BEFORE A LEGISLATURE ABOUT HER LIFE CHANGING EXPERIENCE SADLY SHE NEVER RECOVERED FROM THE BRAIN AND OTHER INJURIES SUFFERED AS A RESULT OF THE BALCONY COLLAPSE SHE DIED EARLIER THIS YEAR AFTER SUFFERING SUFFERING A STROKE BRING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF DEATHS TO SEVEN. SO THAT NO FURTHER FAMILY EVER AGAIN HAS TO BURY THEIR LOVED ONE AS A RESULT OF THIS UNACCEPTABLE SECRECY. I HOPE YOU'LL SUPPORT S. B. ELEVEN FORTY NINE TODAY. HERE WITH ME I HAVE TO WITNESSES WHO WILL SPEAK ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RIGHT TO KNOW ACT THE PUBLIC RIGHT TO KNOW ACT. RICHARD ZITTRAIN PROFESSOR EMERITUS AT UC HASTINGS APPEARING ON BEHALF OF PUBLIC JUSTICE AND AMY COOPER WITH THE NATIONAL COALITION AGAINST PRESCRIPTION DRUG ABUSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU SIR EARLY REGISTER FOR VOICE. DID YOU ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS PROPOSED I CERTAINLY DID BUT I'LL SET THEM AGAIN IF YOU'RE LIKE THAT'S FINE ONLY ONCE IS REQUIRED ALL RIGHT- SO- PROFESSOR. ZITTRAIN YES YES THANK YOU JENNIFER. OUR EVERYTHING THAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY ABOUT THE BILL IS IN THE- REPLY TO THE OPPOSITION THAT I THINK WE'VE ALL DISTRIBUTED TO EACH ONE OF YOU. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ALLOWING INFORMATION ABOUT DANGEROUS PRODUCTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL HAVES HAZARDS TO BE ON FREELY AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FACTUAL INFORMATION. IF ONLY WE KNEW IT. WOULD SAVE COUNTLESS LIVES WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT. DOING AWAY WITH TRADE SECRET PROHIBITIONS THE OPPOSITION SAYS THAT WE ARE THAT'S NOT TRUE SURVIVORS CAREFULLY CONCUR. RIGHT TO THE SUIT YOUR CONTINUE TO BE TRADE SECRET PROTECTIONS WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT MAKING SECRECY. REMAINS PUBLIC TO EVERYBODY AS THE CHAMBERS CITIZENS OPPOSITION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAKING THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE FACTS. PUBLIC FOR EVERYBODY TO SEE IT'S NOT THE AGREEMENT IS THE FACTS WHY IS IT THE FACT. THE FACTS PLUS SECRECY BECAUSE DEATHS SEVEN RELAVIS DECIDED TO A COUPLE OF EXAMPLE I WANT TO MENTION A COUPLE MORE CAR SEAT BACKS THAT WHEN THEY ARE HIT FROM THE REAR SNAPBACK AND EXIT PEOPLE EXIT AND HIT THE REAR WINDSHIELD AND ARE KILLED. SOMETIMES THEY SNAP BACK IN THE HIT CHILDREN IN CAR SEATS IN THE BACK ELEVEN THOUSAND DEATHS BETWEEN 200-020-0015 OVER A THOUSAND THEM WERE CHILDREN IN CAR SEATS. COOPER TIRES THAT DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO HOLD THE TWO FLIES TOGETHER WHICH SEPARATE AND SHRED THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO DEATHS DOCUMENTED BY A LAWYER. FLORIDA JEAN BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND TO THE FOR- TWO ENGINEERS WROTE A LETTER TO UPPER MANAGEMENT SAYING WHY AREN'T WE DOING THESE VERY SAME OLD TOOL. CLIENTS TO GATHER AND UPPER MANAGEMENT SAID IS SIMPLY TOO EXPENSIVE WE DON'T WANT TO SPEND THE MONEY. QUESTION OF MONEY UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE WORST OF OUR PUBLIC COMPANIES. ARE YOU SURE HAS HURT TENS AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF WOMEN BECAUSE OF THE SHREDDING SHRAPNEL THE I. U. D. THAT CAUSES PAIN AND THE INABILITY TO HAVE ORDINARY RELATIONS IN THE WAY THAT IS NORMAL THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF CASES SETTLED SECRETLY BECAUSE THE INFORMATION WAS NOT KNOWN. I'VE GOT A SHEET HERE THAT HAS TEN OTHER EXAMPLES I CAN GIVE YOU FIVE OTHER EXAMPLES I'M MORE KNOWS HOW MANY THERE ARE THAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE WORST MAYBE OXYCONTIN AND STRIDE LIKE TO LOOK AT THE REST OF THE TIME TO MISS AMY COOPER TO SPEAK ABOUT HER OWN PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU PRESS WAS COOPER COOPER AND I AM THE MOTHER OF JOHN GOTTLIEB. I'M HERE TO SHARE HIS STORY FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION EFFECT HIS LOSS HAD ON OUR FAMILY AND OUR COMMUNITY. WE WERE UNAWARE AND WE WERE ON EDUCATED. ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF OXYCODONE. AND THE RESULT OF HIS DEVASTATING AND PREVENTABLE DEATH. AT AGE TWENTY SIX. JOHN WAS MY FIRST BORN SON. HE HAD A HUGE HEART AND FAMILY WAS THE CENTER OF HIS LIFE AND HE LIVED JUST BROTHERS AND A SISTER IMMENSELY. AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW HIM BECAUSE HE'S MORE THAN A STATISTIC AND THERE'S A LOT OF THEM OUT THERE NOW. HE WAS OPERATIONS READER. AN ENTHUSIAST OF ART AND LITERATURE AND MUSIC YOU CAN FIND LISTENING TO EVERYTHING FROM MOZART TO METALLICA. HIS FAVORITE MUSICAL THE SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SIX AND HE LOVED TO COOK. AND HE LOVED TO OUR FAMILY DINNERS THERE ARE A LOT OF TIMES IT WAS LIKE POLITICAL BANTER. AND THERE ARE A LOT OF SIBLING ROCK BAND LATE NIGHTS. AND PING PONG GARAGE TURN IMMENSE. HE WAS PART OF HIS HIGH SCHOOL ROTC. AND A MEMBER OF THE MOCK TRIAL WHERE ACTUALLY TODAY STILL A MEMORIAL PLAQUE HANGS IN THE LOBBY AT THE SCHOOL IN HONOR OF HIM. HE GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE WITH A DEGREE IN PHILOSOPHY AND RHETORIC FROM THOMAS MORE COLLEGE AND BECAME THE FOUNDER. AND CEO OF A START UP COMPANY. AND FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE HE WAS LIVING HIS BEST LIFE. HE HAD AN APARTMENT HAD A PUPPY HAD A GIRLFRIEND. AND IT WAS LIVING WHAT WE ALL THINK OF THE SILICON VALLEY DREAM. IN THE SUMMER OF TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN YOU JUST FINISHED TAKING HAS ALL SETS AT SANTA CLARA UNIVERSITY AND HAD PLANS ACTUALLY GO TO LAW SCHOOL. WHEN USING CALL PRESCRIBED OXY CODEN. FOLLOWING A MOTORCYCLE INCIDENT. AND WE BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT TRIGGERED HIS FALL INTO ADDICTION WHEN HE WAS IN COLLEGE ACTUALLY THAT OXY CODE OWN WAS PRESCRIBED FROM VARIOUS DOCTORS IN VARIOUS STATES. ALL DURING HIS COLLEGE YEARS. JOHN DID NOT SHOW EVIDENCE OF SUBSTANCE MISUSE AND THAT'S WHY WE WERE IN COMPLETE SHOCK. WHEN MY PHONE RANG. AND BY A CALL FROM THE SAN JOSE POLICE LETTING ME KNOW THAT MY BELOVED SON WAS DECEASED. FIVE MONTHS BEFORE WE KNOW WHAT ACTUALLY TOOK MY SIX FOOT FIVE. VIBRANT BRILLIANT YOUNG MAN. WHO WAS SITTING OUTSIDE ON HIS PATIO GIRLFRIEND NO LONGER RESPONSIVE. THAT WAS ON JULY SEVENTH TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. HE DIED OF OVERDOSE. AND HE WAS PRESCRIBED FIFTY SIX PILLS. OF OXY CODE ON ON JULY FIRST. I'M JUST HERE TO TELL YOU THAT WHEN A CHILD DIES IT IS AN IMAGINABLE BUT WHEN THEIR DEATH IS PREVENTABLE IT IS TRAGIC BEYOND WORDS. I HOPE WITH EDUCATION AND PREVENTION SENSELESS DEATHS LIKE MY SONS WILL STOP. AND THAT'S WHY. FOR MY POSITION IN ADDITION TO MY JOB EVERY DAY AND TACK I'M A BOARD MEMBER OF A NON PROFIT AND OUR MISSION IS TO PREVENT DESCRIPTION DRUG ABUSE I APOLOGIZE AND I AM DEEPLY SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS IT'S UNIMAGINABLE PAIN BUT ON CHANNEL WE HAVE LIMIT CERTAIN TESTIMONY THANK YOU FOR THAT AND SYSTEM THANK YOU.

THANK YOU ALL RIGHT LET'S NOW TURN TO THE OPPOSITION- I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE TWO WITNESSES THAT ARE PRESENT HERE IN OPPOSITION- MR MOULTRIE AND MISS JOHNSON YES MISTER THANK YOU ROBERT MOTRIN TO HALF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND I WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THAT- MISTRANSLATION SEJAK HAS BEEN POLITE ENOUGH TO SEAT ME ONE OF HER TWO MINUTES- SUCH TWENTY FIVE THAT FOR THE SHERIFF FRONT. ALL RIGHT NOT AND OTHER WORDS IS FOUR MINUTES IN TOTALITY YES AND FOR ME I HAD FOR THANK YOU. GOOD CHAIR MEMBERS CENTER LEYVA AND- FELLOW KNIFE- HASTINGS- FIRST I WOULD HAVE LIKE THREE POINTS ON THIS BILL I'LL START BY SAYING WE OF COURSE ARE SYMPATHETIC TO THE EXAMPLES ARE NOT HERE TO DEFEND THOSE ARE CONCERNS ARE WITH THE BUSINESSES WHO ARE OPERATING PROPERLY AND IF NOT HAVE THESE PROBLEMS BUT WOULD BE AFFECTED BY THESE CHANGES TO EXISTING LEGAL PROCEDURES. FIRST I WANT TO FLY THE BREADTH OF HE BILL- THE BILLS ARE FITTED REPEATEDLY REFERRED TO AS PRODUCTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS ACTUALLY THE BILL IS NOT LIMITED TO IN ADDITION TO SIMPLY SAYS TIONS THAT CAUSE HARM SO WE ACTUALLY VIEW THIS IS VIEW IT AS AFFECTING POTENTIALLY THE MAJORITY OF CIVIL CASES WITH THESE CHANGES THE DISCOVERY BECAUSE THAT LANGUAGE ISN'T. ACTUALLY THE DEFINITION THE BILL HERE ARE NOT THE BIGGEST CHANGE TO THE BILL IN OUR MIND- BUT WE CERTAINLY ARE OPPOSED TO POLICIES THAT PROHIBIT PARTIES FROM CONTRACTING TO DO THAT IF THEY WOULD LIKE. AND BELIEVE THAT MAY DISINCENTIVE I SETTLEMENT LEAD TO MORE CASES BEING FOUGHT TO TRIAL THAT ISN'T THE BIGGEST CHANGE INOUR READING. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGE THE CHANGE. PROCEDURES PARTICULARLY PROTECTIVE ORDERS- THAT THIS BILL CREATES THAT. THE PROFESSOR MADE THE POINT CORRECTLY DOES NOT. PROHIBIT THE MAKRIS A STRONG PRESUMPTION AGAINST PROTECTIVE ORDERS. AND THAT'S A REALLY BIG DEAL FOR SOME CONTEXT PROTECTIVE ORDERS ARE REGULARLY USED IN LITIGATION. WHEN THERE ARE DOCUMENTS WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE SOMETHING THE PARTIES DISAGREE ABOUT TO FACILITATE THE EXCHANGE I USE THE MY LITIGATED. IT'S VERY COMMON BASICALLY YOU'RE SAYING HEY. WE MAY NOT AGREE ON WHERE THESE ARE PUBLIC. BUT LET'S PUT THAT ASIDE AND COME TO THE COURT IF WE HAVE TO AND LET'S EXCHANGE NOW. AND WE WILL PROVIDE ABOUT THAT FOR THE COURT SUBSEQUENTLY PURSUANT TO THIS ORDER IF IT COMES UP. THE FACILITY DISCOVERY I USE THEM IN CIVIL RIGHTS CASES RELATED TO POLICE POLICIES. WE MIGHT SAY WE DON'T WANT TO GIVE YOU THE POLICY ON HOW THE POLICE CLEAR AN ARMED ROOM. THAT COULD BE DANGEROUS TO POLICE CAN GIVE IT TO UNDER PROTECTIVE ORDER. AND THEN WE CAN DEAL WITH THAT IF YOU WANT TO MAKE IT PUBLIC LATER. SO THESE ARE NORMAL DISCOVERY PRACTICES PRACTICED IN IN. THE I WOULDN'T SAY THE MAJORITY BUT OF. A VERY SUBSTANTIAL CHUNK OF CIVIL CASES. WE HAVE GREAT CONCERN ABOUT CREATING A PRESUMPTION AGAINST THEM. FOR PERSONAL. PERFECTLY PROPER USES- FIVE BRIEFLY TO- BRIEFLY TOUCH ON- ONE OF FRANCE'S ACTIONS COMMENTS WHICH WAS ABOUT THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE FACTS OF THE CASE WE ALSO SOME SOME CONCERNS THAT THE LANGUAGE WHICH IS USED IN THE BILL DOES NOT LIMIT ITSELF TO SAY FOR EXAMPLE THE DEFECT OR THE HOUSE PUBLIC THAT LANGUAGE OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE FACTS OF THE CASE IN OUR MIND IS MUCH BROADER AND TOUCHES ON JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING COVERED IN DISCOVERY WHICH IS ALL ATTORNEYS WOULD KNOW IS MUCHBROADER THAN IN FACT THE CORE ELEMENTS OF THE CASE OR EVEN WHAT'S MISCIBLE TRIAL- THOSE ARE CONCERNS AND I WANT TO BEGIN THANK- FORTY FROM C. JACK FOR GIVING ME THE ONE MINUTE. THANK YOU SINCE MISTER KAREN MEMBERS GORDON JOHNSON WITH FERNANDES RUNS GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS SAY ON BEHALF OF C. JACK ADDRESSING THE COMMITTEE WITH SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE IMPACT SB ELEVEN FORTY NINE WOULD HAVE ON THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS ABILITY TO SETTLE CLAIMS IN AN EFFICIENT COST EFFECTIVE MANNER UNDER S. B. ELEVEN FORTY NINE ANY INFORMATION CONCERNING AN ALLEGED PRODUCT FACT OR HAZARD REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS RELEVANT TO THE ACTION IS PRESUMED PUBLIC. WE'LL SEE BUSINESSES PUT IN THE POSITION OF SETTLING FRIVOLOUS CLAIMS TO AVOID THE DISSEMINATION OF PROPRIETARY INFORMATION ENCOURAGING MORE DEMANDS OUTSIDE THE EYES OF THE COURT WHERE THERE IS NO ACCOUNTABILITY THE FUNCTIONAL IMPACT OF THIS BILL WILL BE IT TO PENALIZE A BUSINESS BY SUBJECTING THEM TO INFORMATION SHARING PRIOR TO EVIDENCE EVER BEING PRESENTED OR SUBSTANTIATED IN COURT ANOTHER HUGE CONCERN WITH THIS BILL IS WHO CAN INTERFACE INTERVENE IN THE ACTION EVEN IF THE PARTIES TO LITIGATION AGREED CONFIDENTIALITY AND ANYONE ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE PUBLIC THE MEDIA YOUTUBER OR ANYONE WITH AN AXE TO GRIND CAN CAN INTERVENE.

E DO NOT HAVE ANYBODY QUEUING UP MR ALL RIGHT OF IF THERE'S NO ONE ON THE PHONE LINE LET'S TURN TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS ASSEMBLY KOWSKI. I'M A- I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH. THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE BILL I FOR THE LIFE OF ME DON'T UNDERSTAND ON PARAGRAPH PAGE FOUR PARAGRAPH TWO WHAT WE PUT DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION TOGETHER THOSE ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS. I AT THAT THIS ME. WELL I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HER NOT TO LET THIS BILL DIE TODAY BUT I'M NOT I DON'T FEEL LIKE I WANT TO SUPPORT IT BECAUSE- BECAUSE THE YOUR WITNESS GAVE US. LOTS OF. EXAMPLES OF DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS. WE'VE IN THE IN YOUR TESTIMONY TALKED ABOUT HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENTAL WELL THAT'S NOT THE TEXT IT DIDN'T FIX IT THAT'S NOT THE TEXT BEFORE MISTRESS AND ENVIRONMENTAL. CONDITIONS IN THE SUPPORTERS EACH OF THEM PUBLIC JUSTICE TALK ABOUT TALK ABOUT PUBLIC HAZARDOUS SECRETS THE TALK ABOUT THE CONSUMER- ATTORNEYS TALK ABOUT HAZARDS THE EVEN THE CONSUMER PORTS TOUCH BUT TOXIC HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS IT'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARD WHICH I FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION. THAT MAY IMPOSE EVERYTHING BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME IT'S TOO LOW FOR MAKING CALLS EVERYTHING VERSUS A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT IS A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT. IS DEFECTIVE AND CAUSES HARM VERSUS ACT AND HAZARD I CAN SEE THAT SO THAT'S MY CONCERN ON THAT USE OF JUST A SUCH A LOW BAR AND MUSHING THEM ALTOGETHER. SO FAIR ENOUGH IS IT JUST SEMANTICS FOR YOU WE KNOW THERE'S HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENT HAS JUST MEANS SOMETHING DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS YEAH THERE'S A DIFF THOSE IN THE FIELD KNOW THAT AND I ASSUME THE PEOPLE PUT TO SEE GATHERED NO THAT ALSO IT JUST SEEMS LIKE IT'S NOT. IT'S BRING IN TOO MANY. WE ARE A LOT INVITE HAPPY CONDITIONS IN THE STATE WHICH ARE THERE I'M MORE WORRIED ABOUT THE HAZARDS THAT ARE THERE VERSUS A CONDITION SIMILAR PROFESSORS AT TRON- ADDRESS THAT BUT I WOULD JUST SAY THIS. JUST BECAUSE I DIDN'T MENTION IT IN MY TESTIMONY DOESN'T MEAN IT'S STILL CONCERNED DOESN'T MEAN THAT HOUSE URGED AREN'T STILL THERE WITH THE ENVIRONMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS IF YOUR CONCERN IS THAT THE BILL'S OVERLY BROAD. WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT. OKAY DID ANYTHING PROFESSOR YOUR SON IN MY LITTLE SHEET THAT I WHIPPED AROUND BUT- AND I WHILE CALDERON WAS SEVERAL SHEETS THERE WERE SEVERAL ON. I'M SORRY DR PASSER YOU'RE FINE MESS UP PROTOCOL. THE HEAD PROFESSOR SYNAPTICS PROFESSOR YOU DON'T WANT TO MESS UP PROGRAM- THERE ARE SEVERAL ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS THAT. ARE PART OF THE LITANY OF THESE- SECRET SITUATIONS I DID. HAVE CORRESPONDENCE WITH YOUR STAFF MEMBER HEATHER WITH REGARD TO THE USE OF THE WORD CONDITION VERSUS HAZARD. AND I KNOW THAT THERE WERE PREVIOUS DRAFTS OF ITERATIONS OF THESE- BILLS THAT USED THE WORD HAZARD I PERSONALLY HAVE. I TAKE YOUR POINT I PERSONALLY HAVE NO PROBLEM. WITH THE WORD HAZARD BEING INSERTED FOR THE WORD CONDITION AND- THAT'S SOMETHING THAT SENATE DELAY FROM HER STAFF AND I WILL BE. HAPPY TO DISCUSS WORK WITH YOU ON I DO HAVE ARE YOU HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH YOUR POINT. AND I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH YOUR WORK CHANGE FOR ME PERSONALLY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. PROFESSOR ARE YOU- CENTERS WITH THOSE THAT ARE WITH US FINISHED. THERE ARE SINISTER. THANK YOU MISTER I SOLD ALL THE TAIL THEN BECAUSE I'M HAVE A CONCERN WITH THAT- DEPENDING ON HOW THE PROFESSOR THE AUTHOR- ANSWER BUT APPLICABILITY THERE IS A THERE'S A SECRET SETTLEMENT ON THE LEASE- CANYON GLASS GAS BLOWOUT HAS VERY EXCITED SEE THIS BILL BUILDING ON YOUR PAST EFFORTS. AND THAT SORT OF WHAT CLOSER SECRECY DUE TO STALL PROGRESS. THIS IS A TWO BILLION DOLLAR SETTLEMENT COME OUT WHERE THE GAS COMPANY ADMITTED NO WRONGDOING BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY- DIDN'T ADDRESS ANY OF THE NON DISCLOSURES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS ALL THE INSPECTIONS ALL THE SORT OF HISTORY THERE. AND THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION IS GOING TO REGULATORY PROCESS WHERE THEY'RE TRYING TO ASSESS WHETHER THEY SHOULD FINE OR NOT AWARE THERE WAS. MISCONDUCT OR NOT. AND IF THEY HAVE NO THAT THAT THAT LITIGATION IN THE CLASS ACTIONS THAT IS COMPLETELY USELESS TO THEM. AND THE RECORD IS COMPLETELY OPAQUE. AND THEY'RE STILL FIGHTING. NOW HOW MANY LATER EIGHT YEARS LATER WITH THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION NOT DISCLOSING ANY OF THAT INFORMATION. SO MIKE MY QUESTION IS- WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS BILL ENCOMPASSES THAT KIND OF SETTLEMENT WHERE. YOU KNOW I KNOW IT'S A IT'S BEEN IT IS THE NATURE OF THE LITIGATION WAS ABOUT HEALTH RISK RIGHT PEOPLE BEING INJURED BY THAT THAT GAS BLOWOUT. BUT I JUST DON'T I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION QUOTE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION THAT POSES A DANGER TO PUBLIC HEALTH OR SAFETY. IS INCLUSIVE AND THAT IF YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE ANY CHANGES JUST THAT WE DON'T BOX OUT THOSE KINDS OF BIG SORT OF ENVIRONMENTAL TORT. CASES SO THANK YOU CENTERS ARE WE WOULD NOT WANT TO DO THAT I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT SPECIFIC CASE I AM AWARE OF IT. BUT THIS BILL MY INTENTION IS TO MAKE SURE THAT COMPANIES LIKE THAT CAN'T HIDE THAT WHY DID THAT HAPPEN WHY DID THE EXPLOSION HAPPEN SO THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN AND KILL MORE PEOPLE PROFESSOR DID YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING BECAUSE OUR OUR GREECE ARE VERY CLEARLY THE INTENT OF THE BILL IS TO INCLUDE. THAT I DON'T THINK THE WORD HACER DETRACTS FROM OKAY FROM THIS SITUATION- AND I THINK THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT IS CLEAR TO INCLUDE EXACTLY THAT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED OXYCONTIN THE FDA WAS TRYING TO REGULATE OXYCONTIN. BUT THEY COULDN'T GET THE INFORMATION EXACTLY THE SAME RIGHT ALL THAT DEPOSITION TESTIMONY BUT THE BUT THE OTHER POINT I JUST WANNA MAKE CLEAR BECAUSE I HAVE HEARD FROM THE FROM THE OPPOSITION I DO APPRECIATE THAT THE CHAIRS WORK ESPECIALLY ON. CLARIFYING SORT OF THE WHAT WHAT ISN'T SUBJECT TO THE DISCLOSRE- AS WELL AS THE PRESUMPTION PROCESS RIGHT YOU COULD STILL ACTUALLY CHALLENGE THE DISCLOSURE IN COURT IT'S NOT AT. NOT JUST DOESN'T JUST OPEN THE DOOR IT IT IT PUTS A THUMB ON THE SCALE BUT THEY COULD STILL FIGHT SOME DISCLOSURE IN AND THE COURT WOULD HAVE TO EVALUATE THAT BUT JUST TO. TO BE SURE THAT- THAT WE ARE. THAT WE'RE CAN. THE RIGHT ACTION HERE AND THAT WE'RE NOT- YEAH THEY WERE NOT SOMEHOW ARBITRARILY EXCLUDING CERTAIN CLASSES OF ACTION BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S INCLUSIVE MAYBE ALL LOOK INTO A GOING FORWARD JUST PROVIDE SOME ASSURANCE ON THAT FRONT- BUT I THINK IF I THINK I'M COMFORTABLE VOTING ON THE BILL- IN THE AMENDED FORM SO. BRING IT FORWARD AND HONESTLY IF YOU KEEP IT STRONG LIKE IT IS I'D LOVE TO BE AT IS A CO AUTHOR TO THE SENATE THANK YOU. SENATE COVER YEAR THAN CENTER LAYER. THANKS VERY MUCH- SO THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS AND I HAVE A QUESTION I. TELL YOU IT MIGHT MY CONCERNS ARE. RIGHT AND I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF BEING ABLE TO GET IT RIGHT- I'M CONCERNED WITH THE SAME ISSUE THAT CENTER RIGHT HOUSE KEY- RAISED ABOUT- THE USE OF. I THINK IT'S TOO BROAD I THINK YOU ASKED THAT QUESTION I THINK THAT'S TRUE NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO IS- THE- WHO CAN. ASK OR REQUIRE THE INFORMATION I THINK IT'S TOO BROAD AS WELL- AND I'M WILLING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT ABOUT THAT BUT BUT THE THIRD THING IN AND I'M I MAY BE SPEAKING- FOR PART OF THE COMMUNITY THAT. THAT IS OBJECTING- AT THE END I MAY HAVE IT WRONG. BUT SO USING THE OXYCONTIN EXAMPLE- THE IT WAS IT WAS LITIGATION BETWEEN THAT PRODUCERS OF THE PROJECT- AND THOSE THAT HAD BEEN HURT RIGHT. BUT THERE WERE BUT THERE WERE. OTHER PARTIES THAT HAD TO MAKE THAT. PARTICULAR DRUG AVAILABLE LIKE DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS AND- AND IN THAT PART AND SO- WOULD IT YOUR BILL REQUIRE THE DISCLOSURE AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE THOSE AT OVERPRESCRIBED BECAUSE THAT THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT ISSUE RIGHT- THE MILLS THAT STARTED CHURNING OUT- HILLS FOR ANYBODY BUT- PRESCRIPTIONS FOR ANYBODY THAT WANTED HIM OUT TALK ABOUT THOSE I'M TALKING ABOUT- THIRD PARTIES THAT MAY HAVE BEEN PART OF THE- OF THE- THE SALE IN THE PURCHASE OF THE PROJECT. BUT DIDN'T PRODUCE IT NECESSARILY WORK WERE ACCEPTING THE- THE ASSURANCES OF THAT OF THE- MANUFACTURE THAT IT WAS A GOOD PRODUCT AND IT SERVED ITS PURPOSE WHICH LATER ENDED UP NOT BEING TRUE CORRECT EVAN LOW PROFESSOR OF SOFT BETTER ANSWER BUT WHAT I WOULD JUST SAY IS THIS WE WANT TO HOLD EVERYONE RESPONSIBLE AND WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM DOCTORS- SINCE WE DISCOVER THE OXY CODE IN AN OXYCONTIN WERE SO ADDICTIVE. IT WAS NOT THE WAY IT WAS SOLD TO THEM IT'S NOT WHAT THEY WERE TROUBLED BY THE MANUFACTURER RIGHT IF THIS BILL IS SIGNED INTO LAW AND THESE COMPANIES SEE THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR LIES THEN MY HOPE WOULD BE IS THEY WOULDN'T LIE TO OTHER PEOPLE DOCTORS WITH THIS CASE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DRUGS SO I THINK RIGHT NOW INPUT- COMPANIES DRUG COMPANIES ANY COMPANY. THEY'RE NOT TOO WORRIED THEY KNOW THAT THEY CAN GO TO COURT AND THEY CAN GET THIS INFORMATION SEALED AND THAT WE WON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR PRODUCT CAN ACTUALLY DO TO SOMEONE BUT ONCE THEY KNOW THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE I THINK WE CAN SEE CHANGE BUT PROFESSOR AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO ADD. WELL I AGREE WITH THAT I'M JUST TRYING TO EXTRAPOLATE TED THEIR CONCERN IS THAT THEY DON'T GET LOOPED IN ON SOMETHING THAT THEY HAD NO THAT'S RIGHT YOU KNOW- BUT THEY DIDN'T PRODUCE THE PRODUCT IS SO THAT IF YOU'VE GOT AN ANSWER THAT I DO SO THE HISTORY. WILL ACTUALLY COTTON IS AT THE STATE OF WEST GENUSS THE- PADUCAH. TO TWO AND THOUSAND FOUR THAT CASE WAS SETTLED. AND IT WAS SETTLED BUT- APPARENTLY FOR A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY BUT THE JUDGE INVOLVED IN THAT CASE CREATED A PROTECTIVE ORDER. SO THAT NONE OF THE TROOPS OF THE OVER PRESCRIPTION OVER ADDICTIVE PROPERTIES. AND THE RATCHETING UP OF THE DOSAGES CAME OUT TO THE PUBLIC AS A RESULT FROM TWO THOUSAND FOUR TO AT LEAST TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ANOTHER TWELVE YEARS. UNTIL INFORMATION WAS RELEASED TO THEM TO THE L. A. TIMES. DOCTORS INNOCENT DOCTORS ARE SEEING PATIENTS WHO DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THIS WHO DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT THESE THINGS WERE BEING GROSSLY OVERPRESCRIBED AND WE'RE GROSSLY ADDICTIVE. LATER ON A JUDGE A FEDERAL JUDGE IN CLEVELAND OHIO AT TWO THOUSAND INDIVIDUAL CASES IN FRONT OF HIM. AND HE CREATED UMBRELLA PROTECTIVE ORDER A COMPLETE CONE OF SILENCE SO AGAIN. THE PUBLIC HAD NOT NO IDEA WHATSOEVER. FTA WHICH WAS TRYING TO INVESTIGATE THIS IS A POINT THAT- STERN RIGHT FTA WAS SHUT OUT OF THE PROCESS THEY COULDN'T INVESTIGATE. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THE DOCTORS THE GOOD HONEST MY PARENTS FOR DOCTORS THE GOOD HONEST DOCTORS REACHES SIMPLY DIDN'T KNOW THAT THE OXYCONTIN WASN'T WORKING AND THEY BOUGHT INTO. TO PRODUCE SPIEL BECAUSE THIS JUDGE IN CLEVELAND FRANKLY HAD KEPT TWO THOUSAND CASES SECRET ALONG WITH MANY MANY OTHERS. SO IN A REAL. SENSE SENATOR CARILLO. THE WERE DR LIKE THE DOCK THAT THE- MISC TELL YOU ABOUT THAT. HELP COME SON BUT TO DIE. FOR IN BY THE BY THE LANGUAGE BECAUSE NONE OF THIS SHOULD COME OUT INTO THE OPEN AND THEY SIMPLY THANK YOU PROFESSOR. I'M SORRY THANKS THANKS OKAY ASCETICAL EURO IS THE QUESTIONS THAT THE ANSWER YOUR QUESTION- WELL I JUST I'M I'M I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BILL DOESN'T END UP. LOOPING IN YES AS YOU SAID- DOCTORS WHO HAD NO CLUE NO HAN WHO WERE NOT A PRIVY TO THAT INFORMATION AND THAT SOMEHOW THEY END UP. AT THAT THEIR THEIR NAMES IN THE INFORMATION- ABOUT THE- M. GET UP IN IN THE NINE TO. SO I HEAR YOU WE WILL LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THAT EITHER THAT IS NOT THE INTENTION OF THE BILL BUT WILL LOOK AT IT AND SEE IF THERE'S A WAY THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T HELP THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT NOT A PROBLEM. OTHER QUESTIONS CONCERNS- YEAH CENTER LAYER. THANK YOU I THINK SOME OF THE- CONVERSATION HAS PASSED. OR WHERE I WAS BUT- A INITIALLY. I ACTUALLY THOUGHT THERE WAS A DISCONNECT- WITH CENTER WHITE HOUSE SKIS CONCERN ON YOURS BECAUSE I THINK HE WAS TALKING ABOUT OVERLY BROAD AND YOU THOUGHT THAT ONE WORD WAS GONNA DRESS IS OVERLY BROAD I DON'T THINK IT DOES. A. N. N. AND SO I THINK IT GETS SYNTHESIZED MAYBE I WOULD SAY GIVEN ALL THE DISCUSSION. THAT THIS BILL ADDRESSES A PROBLEM THAT WAS REALLY EMPLOYEE. YOU KNOW DEMONSTRATED AND I SUSPECT WE ALL REALLY WANTED TO BE ADDRESSED. AND THEN THERE'S A PROCESS AND THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE PROCESS ACT ADEQUATELY ADDRESSES A PROBLEM AND THEN THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER THERE'S UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. AND THE PROCESSES IT AND SO I'M WITH THE GROUP THAT- I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THIS. BUT I JUST HOPE THERE'S NOT KNOWLEDGE MEANT THAT THOSE ARE THE ISSUES IT AND THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT HAVE TO BE ASKED. IN A CLEAR WAY TO MAKE SURE AS THIS MOVES OR COMES BACK THAT IT IT DOES ALL THAT IN IT AND THIS BILL WAS SO BIG BECAUSE IT ADDRESSES SUCH A BIG PROBLEM. THAT WHETHER IT'S DISCOVERY OR FOR OTHER THINGS IT HAS THE POSSIBILITY REALLY ROPING A LOT OF THINGS IN HERE AND SO. I'M JUST HOPING THAT MAYBE IT WAS SOME OF THE SENATORS THAT MADE COMMENT YOU'LL GROUND TROOPS THIS IN A WAY THAT AND WILL ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES IT AND THAT LEADS TO. THE POINT THAT YES- IT'S SUCH A BIG PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED I'M GONNA VOTE TO MOVE THE BILL FORWARD IN THE HOPES THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE ABSOLUTELY. YES ALL RIGHT THANK YOU- THANK YOU CENTER LIVER FOR WORKING WITH US ALSO ON SOME CLARIFICATION- AND IT. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POLICY HAS TO BE AT ACTUALLY- INTERPRETED AND THE POTENTIALLY ENFORCED BY A JUDGE AND SO ONE OF OUR CHALLENGES MAKE SURE IT'S CLEAR ENOUGH FOR. THE JUDGE TO BE ABLE TO. PROPERLY INTERPRET THIS IS A QUESTION I AND I DAHLE DIRECTED TO USE OUR LEYVA BUT MY GUESS IS THAT- PROFESSORS IT TURNS PROBABLY GOING TO WANT TO TAKE IT. SO I'M LOOKING AT PAGE FIVE AND I'M LOOKING AT THE PRESUMPTION THAT SAYS. THE PARTY REQUESTING THE ORDER DEMONSTRATES THAT THE PRESUMPTION IN FAVOR OF DISCLOSURES CLEARLY OUTWEIGHED IF YOU RECOGNIZE THAT. BOB I ASSUME THAT THIS IS A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION RIGHT. RIGHT AND IT'S REMARKABLE BY A PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE. BECAUSE THE LANGUAGE IS NOT CUSTOMARY LANGUAGE. WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO ANSWER SOME YES PLEASE YES ARE THE WAITING PROCESS IS DEFINED AS. ARE CLEARLY OUTWEIGH IT IT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR LEGISLATION TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T SPECIFY CURRENT CONVINCING EVIDENCE IS SUPPOSED TO A PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE AS OPPOSED TO PROVE BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT THIS RESERVE IT'S CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT USES THE WERE WERE CLEARLY OUTWEIGHED BUT THE POINT IS THAT THE PHRASE. ORDINARILY IN THE LEGISLATION THAT I HAVE READ AT LEAST- PUTTING IN A BURDEN OF PROOF WOULD NOT BE APPROPRIATE IN THIS SITUATION RATHER THE PHRASE CLEARLY OUTWEIGHED GIVES THE JUDGE GARDENS IS THE INFORMATION THAT SOUGHT TO BE PROTECTED CLEARLY OUT MORE. CLEARLY OUTWEIGHS THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN THE IN THE INSTANCE OF HOW YOU CREATE AN IPHONE THE ANSWER IS GOING TO BE US IN THE ANSWER AND THE INSTANT SUPPORT YOUR PROTECT SOMETHING THAT'S DEFECTIVE HATCH IS GOING TO BE NOW. BUT THE OUTWEIGHED WORD MEANS THE JUDICIAL DISCRETION IS GOING TO BE EXERCISED BY EACH INDIVIDUAL JUDGE TO SAY BASED ON WHAT I'VE HEARD. IS YOU SUBMITTED TO ME COUNSEL YOUR ARGUMENTS I'D THE JUDGE BELIEVES THAT IT HAS OR HAS NOT BEEN CLEARLY OUTWEIGHED SO FIRST LET ME SURE CUT YOU OFF. YEARS WORTH ACTUALLY LIKE US TO DEFINE THE EVIDENTIARY STANDARD THAT THEY'RE IN REQUIRED TO. EMPLOY IN THE T'S WHY QUESTION AND I ASSUME THAT IT'S A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION THAT CAN BE OVERCOME BY A PREPONDERANCE ALTHOUGH THAT THE USING THE PREPONDERANCE STANDARD THAT THE COURT THE NEEDS TO LOOK TO SEE. IF IT'S CLEARLY OUTWEIGHED BY SPECIFIC AND SUBSTANTIAL OVERRIDING CONFIDENTIALITY INTERESTS SO I'M THAT'S THAT'S ALL I'M INTERPRETING IT AND I SUPPOSE WHEN SOMEBODY LOOKS BACK AT THE LEGISLATIVE. HISTORY THEY'LL HEAR THOSE COMMENTS SO THAT'S THAT'S POINT ONE. POINT TWO IS THAT- AND IT WAS MY SUGGESTION CONCERNED I THINK THAT YOU- AT LEAST INDIRECTLY ADDRESSED THAT CONCERN THE CONCERN IS THAT. IF THERE IS A THIRD PARTY WHO IS SUBPOENAED FOR INFORMATION FOR EXAMPLE A DOWNSTREAM SUPPLIER AND UPSTREAM SUPPLIER OF CERTAIN- INFORMATION THAT THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY AND I WE'VE WE'VE MENTIONED ANALYSIS BUT THEY HAVE A- AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO. OBJECT AND THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT POINT IN TIME I'M NOT SURE THAT THE- STANDARD SHOULD APPLY TO THEM THEY'RE NOT A PART OF THE LITIGATION BUT THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO PROTECT OUR OWN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY- IF THE COURT SO FINDS THAT THAT- IT IS IN THE PUBLIC'S INTEREST TO PROTECT. OTHERS NOW THIS BILL CREE IT'S THIS INTEREST. PHILOSOPHIC CHALLENGE FOR US THE CHEN. THAT SOMEBODY'S GOING TO PAY THE PRICE FOR THE BILL PEOPLE ARE GOING TO PAY THE PRICE WE'RE GONNA BE INDIVIDUAL- PLAINTIFFS INDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFFS WHO COULD REACH- AND SETTLE THE MATTER IN A MUCH MUCH MUCH HIGHER LEVEL. THAN THEY MIGHT OTHERWISE BY FORGOING THAT RIGHT. OR FOREGOING THAT OPPORTUNITY KEEP THE SETTLEMENT CONFIDENTIAL. NOT MY JOB NOT MY JOB TO FIGURE OUT- THAT MY JOB IS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S BEST PUBLIC POLICY IN HIS DISCLOSURE AND TRANSPARENCY BETTER PUBLIC POLICY I THINK IT IS BETTER PUBLIC POLICY. BUT BUT WE SHOULD BE MINDFUL THAT THAT IT'S NOT FREE THAT SOMEBODY'S GIVING UP- AN OPPORTUNITY HERE TO A HIGHER SETTLEMENT SALT- HAVING SAID THAT- IT IF I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO RESPOND ANY THAT pSENATORS I KNOW YOU'VE GOT A LONG AGENDA. THAT'S HUSH MONEY AND IN FACT THERE WILL BE HARSH MONEY BUT IT'S INTERESTING THAT WE HAVE THE VERY STRONG SUPPORTER CA OC. AND THEY'RE THE ONES TO REPRESENT US LIKE THIS. WITH RESPECT TO THE ISSUE OF THIRD PARTIES I PROVIDED CHRISTIAN WITH TWO DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF LANGUAGE THAT WOULD CORRECT THAT. DISCUSSED IT WAS SENATOR LABOR WE ALL AGREE THAT IT IT IT IS WORTHY OF. BEING PUT INTO THE BILL CHRISTIAN SENT ME AN EMAIL LAST NIGHT SAYING HE PREFERRED ONE OVER THE OTHER I'M NOT SURE WHICH ONE. BUT CLEARLY THAT NEEDS TO BE. TAPPED A- LITTLE LOOPHOLE NEEDS TO BE. A FIX AS TO THE BURDEN OF PROOF IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT CAN BE THE PRODUCT OF ONGOING DISCUSSIONS ARE. WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING IT INTERNALLY ARE CAMILLE AND I'VE BEEN DISCUSSING IT A LOT. THE CENTERS STAFFERS FROM DISCUSSING AND WE OUGHT TO MAKE SURE IF YOU THINK SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE CLARIFIED ME MAKE IT MORE CLEAR THAN. WE CAN MAKE MONTHLY RIGHT. WE OUGHT TO DO IT HERE THAN HAVE THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT TO IT SO THANK YOU ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT ANSWER REASONABLE RIGHT. RIGHT SO CENTER LEYVA- THIS THERE BEEN IN MOTION. MOST SINISTER MOST THE BILL- WHICH I CLOSE I WOULD LIKE TO CARS THANK YOU. THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR ALL OF YOUR THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. I AM NOT A LAWYER BUT I BROUGHT ONE WITH ME AND ALL OF YOU ARE LAWYERS AND SO YOU WORRY ABOUT THE DETAILS. I'M A PERSON WHOSE PASSION ABOUT KEEPING PEOPLE SAFE. ABOUT COMPANIES THAT DESIGN PRODUCTS OR THEY CREATE SITUATIONS WHERE PEOPLE ARE EITHER. HARMED OR KILLED AND THIS BILL IS SIMPLY ABOUT KNOWLEDGE THIS IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT YOU AS AN INFORMED CONSUMER. CAN MAKE THE DECISION THAT IS RIGHT FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. THE COFFEE THAT YOU'RE DRINKING. IF THAT COFFEE COMPANIES HAD PROBLEMS AND MAYBE THEY PLEASANT PEOPLE YOU WOULD PROBABLY WANT TO KNOW THAT. SO IN CLOSING WHAT I WILL SAY IS. THIS BILL WILL DO THREE THINGS ONE IT WILL CREATE A PRESUMPTION FINDS THAT THE PUBLIC INTEREST. INDICATED INTEREST INTEREST INDEX DISCLOSURE IS CLEARLY OUTWEIGHED BY SPECIFIC AND SUBSTANTIAL NEED FOR SECRECY WHAT WE JUST DISCUSSED. TWO IT WILL PROHIBIT SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS THAT RESTRICT THE DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION ABOUT A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT OR ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION. THAT POSES A DANGER TO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY AND MAKE ANY PROVISION IN AN AGREEMENT VOID. AS AGAINST PUBLIC POLICY AND THUS AND FORCIBLE WE WILL WORK ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL PART SENATOR AKOWSKI. THREE IT NARROWLY TAILORS ITS APPLICATION TO ONLY INFORMATION ABOUT A DANGER. TO PUBLIC HEALTH OR SAFETY. THAT IS LIKELY TO CAUSE SIGNIFICANT OR SUBSTANTIAL POTTERY BODILY INJURY. OR ILLNESS OR DEATH THIS IS ABOUT KNOWLEDGE AND SPOT P. KEEPING PEOPLE CONSUMERS SAFE. MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SAID EARLIER- MINUTE CHIEF COUNSEL IF YOU WOULD CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS SB ELEVEN FORTY NINE BY SENATOR LEYVA WITH THE MOTION BY SENATOR STERN THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED AMBERG HI I'M BURGER AYE BOARD. CAREER DID I SELL THE REST SO HI GONZALEZ. HERTZBERG JONES LAYERED LAYERED HI STERN ALL RIGHT STERN AYE WHITE HOUSE SKI. WIENER SO FAR YOU HAVE FOUR GUYS WITH MEMBERS MISSING ALL RIGHT WE'LL PUT ON CALL THANK YOU THANK YOU BOB THEN- I TINK CONSISTENT MOUNT YOU CAN SEE MAKE SURE THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT I ANNOUNCED THAT I THINK. SENATOR COM LOGGERS NEXT. RIGHT RIGHT. THANK YOU SENATE CAMARGO FOR YOUR PATIENCE. YEAH HE. SENATOR FLOOR'S YOURS I THINK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR. AND MEMBERS I AM HERE TODAY TO PRESENT SENATE BILL TEN FIFTY FIVE. DRIVER'S LICENSE SUSPENSIONS RELATED TO CHILD SORT CHILD SUPPORT ARREARS AND I AM TAKING THE AMENDMENTS I AM TAKING THE AMENDMENTS. I AM TAKING THE AMENDMENTS OKAY. HELLO TEN FIFTY FIVE. ANY MY COFFEE SIX TO ADDRESS PUNITIVE MEASURES TAKEN AGAINST THOSE THAT HAVE FALLEN INTO CHILD SUPPORT ARREARS SPECIFICALLY THIS BILLTARGETS DRIVER'S LICENSE SUSPENSION MANDATES RELATED TO MISSED CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY HAS AN INCREDIBLY HIGH PUNITIVE MEASURE IN PLACE FOR CHILD SUPPORT ARREARS. IN ADDITION TO DRIVER'S LCENSE SUSPENSIONS THE STATE ALSO IMPOSES A 10% INTEREST RATE ON MISSED PAYMENTS AND PASSPORT AMOUNT FOR BALANCES THAT REACHED TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ON THEIR OWN THESE MEASURES ARE OVERLY PUNITIVE BUT TAKEN TOGETHER THEY SEVERELY IMPACT FAMILIES LIVES AND HAVE SHOWN NO EVIDENCE OF INCREASING CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS. LOW INCOME NON CONSTRUCT NONCUSTODIAL PARENTS ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING TO MAINTAIN THE BASIC NECESSITIES THE THREAT OF LOSING THEIR DRIVER'S LICENSE AND THEIR MEANS TO COMMUTE TO WORK OR TO VISIT THEIR CHILDREN. CAN BE DEVASTATING STUDIES CONTINUE TO SHOW THAT NONCUSTODIAL PARENTS WHO AREN'T THREATENED WITH PUNITIVE MEASURES TEND TO PAY THEIR CHILD SUPPORT MORE CONSISTENTLY VISIT MORE OFTEN WITH THEIR CHILDREN AND HAVE A BETTER RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR CO PARENT. REPORTS HAVE ALSO SHOWN THE CYCLE OF UNEMPLOYMENT INCARCERATION IN DEBT ARE MORE PREVALENT WHEN PARENTS ARE SUBJECTED TO AGGRESSIVE ENFORCEMENT SB TEN FIFTY FIVE WILL ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF DESTRUCTIVE CHILD SUPPORT ARREARS MANDATES WITH THE TWO FOLD APPROACH. FIRST CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO NOTIFY DMV TO SUSPENDED DRIVER'S LICENSE DUE TO CHILD SUPPORT ARREARS IF THE INDIVIDUAL MAKES AT OR BELOW 60% OF THE COUNTY MEDIAN INCOME. AND SECOND IT WILL EXTEND THE CURRENT DECSS PRACTICE OF DMB NOTIFICATIONS AFTER THIRTY DAYS OF OVERDUE CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS TO NO MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY. THIS EXTENSION FROM THIRTY DAYS TO SIX MONTHS WILL ALIGN THE STATE'S DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES DMB NOTIFICATION PRACTICE MORE CLOSELY WITH MANDATES AND OTHER STATES. OTHER STATES IN CLOSING CONSIDERED POOR. THERE IS NO PROOF THAT THESE PUNITIVE MEASURES WORK IT IS COUNTERINTUITIVE TO EXPECT SOMEONE TO PAY THEIR CHILD SUPPORT WHEN WE'VE TAKEN AWAY THEIR MEANS TO GET OR KEEP THEIR JOB. CALIFORNIA MUST NOT CONTINUE TO PUNISH SOMEONE WHO IS IN A TERRIBLE FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCE WHO WANTS TO CONTRIBUTE AND BE A PART OF THEIR FAMILY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. AND WITH ME HERE IN SUPPORT AS MICHAEL HERALD FROM THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AND PAUL GIVE IDA AND IMPACTED PARENT. ALL RIGHT MR HERALD GO AHEAD. OF YOU SENATOR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY CAROL WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. WE STAND STRONG SUPPORT OF S. B. TEN FIFTY FIVE TODAY. SB TEN FIFTY FIVE CONTINUES IN THE VEIN OF MANY BILLS THAT WESTERN CENTER ANOTHER ADVOCATES ABROAD IN RECENT YEARS. REALLY POINTING OUT THE HIGH COST OF BEING POOR. AND OUR CURRENT CHILD SUPPORT LAWS HAVE THAT AFFECT ALSO JUST LIKE WE SEEM TO TRAFFIC COURTS PARKING TICKETS JUVENILE FINES AND FEES CIVIL ASSESSMENTS- AND THE LIST GOES ON AND ON. OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE OVER TIME THAT WE THOUGHT AT THE TIME WE'RE GOOD POLICY BUT ACTUALLY END UP BEING. NEGATIVE AND DISPROPORTIONATELY NEGATIVE FOR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS PARTICULARLY BLACK AND BROWN CALIFORNIANS. AS SENATOR CALM WATER POINTED OUT THE IMPACTS OF OUR CURRENT POLICY ARE THAT. OF THE EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS THAT THE STATE IS VOTED ON PAY CHILD SUPPORT. MORE THAN 80% OF IT IS OPEN PEOPLE WHO MAKE LESS TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR OR WHO HAVE NO REPORTED INCOME AT ALL. SO THIS POLICY. SIGNIFY DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS THE LOWEST INCOME CALIFORNIANS AND MAKES IT HARDER FOR THEM TO LIVE UP TO THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO BE ABLE TO PAY CHILD SUPPORT- ARE WITNESSED. AN IMPACTED COMMUNITY MEMBER WILL SPEAK TO THIS DIRECTLY IN A MOMENT- BUT WITHOUT A DRIVER'S LICENSE IT IS VERY HARD TO GET A JOB- IN NEW JERSEY 40% OF THE PEOPLE LOST THEIR LICENSE DIDN'T GET THEIR JOB BACK. AND ANOTHER 30% HAD TO TAKE LOWER PAYING JOBS SO THIS HAS A REAL IMPACT IF WE WANT PEOPLE TO PAY CHILD SUPPORT. THEY NEED TO HAVE THEIR LICENSES HENCE MISTER GOODBAR IS WAITING ON LINE I THINK TO.

THAT HAPPENS ON DISTRICT IN SCHOOL SITE CAMPUSES THROUGH COORDINATORS. WHICH TODAY SERVE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED SCHOOLS ACROSS FIFTEEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THAT COUNTY ALONE. OF THESE PROGRAMS CALLED COMMUNITY SCHOOLS IN SOME PLACES OF COURSE EXIST IN MANY OTHER PLACES IN CALIFORNIA. I BELIEVE. THAT THE SUCCESSFUL WITHOUT SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS THAT LINK MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. BETWEEN COUNTIES IN SCHOOLS GUIDE THE FRAMEWORK OF SCHOOL BASED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES STATEWIDE TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CREDENTIALED PEOPLE SUPPORT SERVICES PERSONNEL LIKE COUNSELORS SCHOOL SOCIAL WORKERS NURSES PSYCHOLOGISTS IT'S CENTER AT OUR SCHOOL SITES. WE MUST EXPAND OR SEE WHAT STRATEGY TO PROVIDE PROVIDE SCHOOL BASED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO STUDENTS AND ENSURETHE SERVICES PROVIDED AMONG VARIOUS ENTITIES ARE SUSTAINABLE EQUITABLE AND BETTER COORDINATED TO FILL GAPS IN SERVICES THAT EXISTS FOR STUDENTS.

AS THOSE INDIVIDUALS OR ENTITIES WITH A PUPIL PERSONNEL SERVICES CREDENTIAL LOCATED ON A SCHOOL CAMPUS OR UNDER CONTRACT BY COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDER. TO ENSURE THAT THESE SCHOOLING SERVICES COORDINATORS CAN BATTERY FOR BOTH STUDENTS AND FAMILIES. TO MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT CARE. BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THE SUICIDE RATE FOR CHILDREN AGES TEN TO FOURTEEN MORE THAN DOUBLED. SUICIDE IS NOW THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR INDIVIDUALS. BETWEEN THE AGES OF TEN AND TWENTY FOUR. CODE NINETEEN OF COURSE IS ONLY EXACERBATED THESE ISSUES. A RECENT REPORT PUBLISHED BY THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION TOLD THE EFFICACY OF A SCHOOL BASED APPROACH TO STUDENT WELLNESS DEMONSTRATED THAT WE ARE WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW. STUDENTS ARE TWENTY ONE I SKEWS ME STUDENTS ARE TEN TO TWENTY ONE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO RECEIVE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES WHEN THEY'RE PROVIDED ON A SCHOOL CAMPUS.

THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT THANK YOU ALL RIGHTY- BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS KERRY MEMBERS SAYING YES SIR CABALLERO REGARDS TO- I THINK THIS IS REALLY AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE SCHOOL TO KNOW- GET INFORMATION. WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE PARENTS- ABOUT- THINGS THAT WOULD HELP THE SCHOOL TO BETTER PREPARE A GOOD LEARNING ENVIRONMENT AND I SAY THIS AS- A MOTHER OF FIVE CHILDREN IT- THAT- NEEDED EXTRA HELP IN THEIR LEARNING AND THEY HAD DISABILITIES AND SO IT'S REALLY TOUGH ON THE TEACHERS- TO FIGURE OUT WHAT KIND OF ENVIRONMENT THEY SHOULD CREATE AND- AND THIS THIS PROVIDES IN. A PATHWAY TO BE ABLE TO SHARE INFORMATION BUT I WANT TO BE VERY CERTAIN THAT UPON SHARING INFORMATION WITH THE SCHOOL THAT THE INFORMATION IS KEPT IN A CONFIDENTIAL- ENVELOPE. ONLY TO BE OPENED BY- INDIVIDUALS THAT ACTUALLY HAVE A NEED TO SEE THAT INFORMATION. I WOULDN'T BET YOU KNOW IT IT WILL BE ALL HAVE SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS TRICKS IN OUR IN OUR IN OUR DISTRICTS. THAT HAVE VERY VERY- LIMITED NUMBER OF TEACHERS AND STAFF IN THE FRONT OFFICE THEY KNOW EACH OTHER THEY GAS UP THEIR FRIENDS- THEY WERE ALL FROM MY NEIGHBORHOOD INSIDE WANT TO MAKE SURE. FOR INFORMATION. IT WOULD. BUT THEN WOULD BE USED TO TRACK MY KID- AS THEY GROW OLDER AND MAYBE GROW GROW OUT OF SOME OF THAT BEHAVIORAL ISSUES THAT ARE CHALLENGES FOR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHERS SO- I JUST WANT TO PUT THAT OUT THERE- I ASKED THE QUESTION AS TO WHETHER IT WOULD BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL- AND THE ANSWER IS YES BUT I REALLY DO THINK THAT IT PROBABLY REQUIRES A LITTLE BIT STRONGER THAT THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT STEEP IT IN. THE FILES THE I ASSUME. SEEING IT. AS EARLY THAT. THE STAFF THEY DON'T NEED TO SEE IT. THANK YOU SIR GOING ARE OTHER QUESTIONS SIR MOTION SIR SIR RUSSELL QUESTION. I JUST REALLY AGREE WITH THAT THE CENTER NIGHT- FUND WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT IT WAS WITH A GUARDIAN CONSENT- THAT REALLY CALMED ME DOWN A LOT SO- WITH SIMILAR CONCERNS AS THE CENTER BUT I WILL MOVE THE WHOLE. OF QUE SERA SO MOST THE BILL. WHICH CLOSER CORTESE. MISTER ALL IT WAS THE THOUGHT THROUGH PRETTY WELL IN HIS YOU KNOW- PRIOR TO MY SERVICE HERE SERVING AS COUNTY SUPERVISOR IN A COUNTY WITH THE SECOND LARGEST PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM IN THE STATE- WE WERE ALL TRAINED OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN ON PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY AN PARTICULARLY COOPER AT THE SAME TIME- GRANT WE'VE RUN INTO THIS PROBLEM AS HAVE OTHER COUNTY ORGANIZATIONS AS THE STATE CONTINUES TO INVESTMENT ALL SERVICE. IS BUT THE PRIVATE. REFERRING TO SOME CENTER COMING CODE AND HIPPER FEDERAL LAW OVER THE TOP OF THAT BUT THE AD CODE- IS VERY VERY CLEAR AND PRESCRIPTIVE IN TERMS OF THE SHARING AND CONFIDENTIALITY OF INFORMATION NOT JUST STUDENT RECORDS BUT PARTICULARLY HEALTH RECORDS- BUT THAT'S THE EIGHT CODE THE COUNTIES ARE GOVERNED AS YOU KNOW IS A FORMAL ACTIVE A LOCAL OFFICIAL BY THE GOVERNMENT. SO WE BUILD IS FROM IT STANDPOINT IS BASICALLY CREATE A PASS UP A PASSAGEWAY HE WILL YOU KINDLY DESCRIBED FROM THE GOVERNMENT CODE OVER TO THE ED CODE WITH PREEMPTING HIPPER- OR OR INTO THE PRIVACY LAWS IN FACT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF- FOR TALKING TO US ABOUT INCLUDING THAT LANGUAGE THAT I REFERRED TO EARLIER- TO MAKE IT VERY VERY CLEAR. AFFIRMATIVELY IN THE BILL OTHER THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL THAT IT PREAMPS. HIP BUT AND IN FACT- HIP. YOU NOT ONLY HAVE TO COMPOSE COMPORT HIPPER BUT HAVE A SIGNED AUTHORIZATION- EVEN KNOWS TREATMENT IS STILL A REQUIRED IN THIS BILL THAT WAS SIGNED AUTHORIZATION WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU- IT'S BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR ALSO MANAGE ACCOUNTS IF YOU WOULD CALL THE ROLL YES THIS IS- S. B. HELLO. BEFORE BY SEN. WITH THE AT MOTION SENATOR US SO THE MOTION IS TO PASS. UMBERG BY AMBERG BY BURGESS CABALLERO GUERRIERO I US I THE REST SO I GONZALEZ HERTZBERG. JONES LAYERED- LAYERED ICE STERN WHITE CAL SKENEIDAE BY CASKEY AYE WIENER. YOU HAVE FIVE TO ZERO SO BIRTH MEMBERS MISSING ALL RIGHT LET'S PUT THAT ON HIS ALMOST THIRTY. THANK YOU CENTER PAN. W. THE END OF THEIR PAIN FLOOR'S YOURS THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON- FAIR MEMBERS- PROUD TO PRESENT TO YOU SENATE BILL ELEVEN SEVENTY TWO- IF YOU'RE A STUDENT AND YOU NEED TO TAKE AN EXAM- REMOTELY- THE SCHOOL MAY REQUIRE YOU TO VERIFY YOUR IDENTITY THROUGH HI PRACTICING A PROCTOR IN COMPANY THAT STATE THAT THE SCHOOL IS CONTRACTED WITH. AND THE PROCTER COMPANY MAY ASK OF THE STUDENT SO WITH THAT HAPPENS OF YOUR CHILD OR MAYBE YOURSELF. ALL SORTS OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. AND SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES SENATE BILL EVANS ANY TO DOES IS TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF OUR STUDENTS BY LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF PERSONAL BIOMETRIC INFORMATION DATA REMOTE ACTING COMPANY CAN COLLECT THE ONLY INFORMATION THAT'S NECESSARY TO OFFER THEIR SERVICES. THIS BILL ALSO EMPOWERS STUDENTS TO TAKE ACTION IF THEIR PRIVACY HAS BEEN VIOLATED BY REQUIRING DATA MINIMIZATION AND ALLOWING THE HARM USERS OF REMOTE PARKING SOFTWARE TO SUE COMPANIES. THE OTHER PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. SINCE THE START OF THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC MORE STUDENTS AND INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO TAKE TEST REMOTELY. AND REMOTE PROMPTING COMPANIES ARE COLLECTING BIOMETRIC DATA SUCH AS FACIAL RECOGNITION TEMPLATES FINGERPRINTS CITIZENSHIP DATA MEDICAL% INFORMATION BROWSING HISTORY AND VIDEO AND AUDIO. OF THE USER'S SURROUNDINGS. CURRENTLY THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT COVERS PARKING COMPANIES BUT THE LAW IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO LIMIT DATA AND PROVIDE THE STUDENTS THE TOOLS TO RECRUIT TO RECUPERATE DAMAGES. REMOTE CONTRACTING COMPANIES HAVE BEEN EXPLOITING A LOOPHOLE IN THE C. C. P. A.'S DEFINITIONS BY CLIMBING THERE ARE SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT WORK THROUGH THE SCHOOL AND NOT WORKING DIRECTLY WITH THE STUDENTS SO THEY SAY WELL WE HAVE A CONTRACT WITH THE SCHOOL WE DON'T HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH STUDENT. AS A RESULT THESE COMPANIES COLLECT STUDENTS PRIVATE INFORMATION AND HOLDER DATA FAR LONGER THAN IS NECESSARY TO ADMINISTER AN EXAM. OR FOR OTHER K. TO TWELVE PURPOSES THIS BILL IS ABOUT GIVING OUR STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES MORE TOOLS TO PROTECT OUR OWN PERSONAL INFORMATION AND ENCOURAGING PROMPTING COMPANIES TO ME WERE MORE TRANSPARENT. ABOUT THEIR DATA COLECTION SO IT IS LIMITED TO ONLY WHAT IS NECESSARY TO CONDUCT AN EXAM TO SURE IT'S SECURITY. AGAINST STUDENTS WILL HAVE A CHOICE YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE EXAM IN ORDER TO PASS THE CLASS AND THE PROPERTY COMPANY YOU DON'T GET TO CHOOSE YOU AND FOR THE DAY THE MANIFESTATION. YOU ARE NOT IN A POSITION TO REFUSE UNLESS YOU PLAN NOT TO PASS THAT CLASS. SO JOIN ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN VERY REMOTE CONFERENCE IS. HALEY TSUKAYAMA SENIOR LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR LIKE CHRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION AND CHRISTIAN PAKSE. UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCHER AT CALTECH RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU. SENATE PAN OF MISS HAYLEY TSUKAYAMA ARE YOU AVAILABLE YES HI I AM HELLO THE FLOOR IS YOURS AND- THANK YOU HI REALLY FAMOUS IN THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION WE HAVE TO DISTILL FOOTBALL THE DIFFERENCE ACROSS CALIFORNIA I THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY PART OF SB ELEVEN SEVENTY TWO. THIS BILL EXTENSIBLE DATA MINIMIZATION GUARDRAILS TO LIMIT WHAT INFORMATION CAN BE COLLECTED BY REMOTE PROXY COMPANIES SUCH AS FACTORY OKAY AFTER YOU AN EXAMPLE AND ALLOW STUDENTS TO TAKE PARKING COMPANY TO COURT IF THE GUARD REAL ARE NOT FOLLOWED. DURING PANDEMIC REMOTE TRACKING SERVICE USE HAVE INCREASED 2% FOR MANY STUDENTS SERVICES ARE NOT OPTIONAL ONE STUDY FOUND 97% OF TO KEEP USING THE TOOLS WERE REQUIRED TO STUDENTS ARE OFTEN POWERLESS TO EXERCISE ANY CONTROL OVER THEIR INFORMATION FOR USE THAT SOFTWARE AT THE PREREQUISITE FOR TAKING A PATH OFTEN INCLUDING FOR IMPORTANT. EXAMS THAT CAN. IT TOOK THEIR LIVES. THE COMPANIES COLLECT A VAST OF DATA AS- AND PAN- AT. THEY OFTEN HANG ON TO THIS. FOR YEAR. REMOTE PROCTER AND- ALL THREE. THAT ACCURACY. WOULD BE ABLE TO THE FIVE FAILING RECOGNIZE BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE PROPERLY AND IN ACCURATELY FLOODING. AS CHEATING CREATING A RECORD OF DATA THAT MAKES IT HARDER FOR SOME ALREADY DISADVANTAGED USERS TO SUCCEED. DESPITE IRAQI NEWS RESULT IN DATA BREACHES OF CREDIT PRIVATE INFORMATION COLLECTED BY. HOLDING CONCERTS THREE BY FEDERAL LAWMAKERS IN CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT. THERE NO PLACE TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF TEST TAKERS. WHAT CALIFORNIA'S YOU HAVE SOME PROTECTION FEDERAL AND STATE AND YOU CAN CREDIT YOU ARE DO NOT ADEQUATELY LIMIT THE INFORMATION COLLECTED BY THE SOFTWARE. THAT THEY PROVIDE INDIVIDUAL REPORT FROM A STUDENT INFORMATION IS USED TO VIOLATION OF THE LAWS. OF THE CCPA ALLOWED. TO COLLECT USE AND SHARE INFORMATION BEYOND WHAT IS STRICTLY NECESSARY TO CORRECTLY SERVICES BY BEARING THE ADDITIONAL USES OR DISCLOSURES AND THE PRIVACY QUALITY. DIFFICULT BILL RIGHT THE IMBALANCE THAT EXISTS AND IF YOU CAN BE BILITY TO PROTECT THEIR OWN PRIVATE INFORMATION. WILL ALSO REQUIRE FRACTURING COMPANIES TO BE MORE TRANSPARENT ABOUT THEIR DATA COLLECTION AND USAGE WHICH WILL HELP INCREASE SECURITY. AND IT WILL ALLOW COURTS TO ANALYZE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE TOOLS. I THINK FROM DR RICHARD PAN FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND ALL. OF YOU FOR YOUR TIME. I URGE YOUR VOTE FOR SB. SEVENTY TWO.

IN HOTEL LOBBY I WALK I APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU MEMBERS THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR THIS BILL RUN OKAY LET ME WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO SB ELEVEN SEVENTY TWO. OUR ASSOCIATION CONTINUES TO REVIEW THE BILL AND WE INTEND TO WORK WITH AUTHORS OFFICE TO PROVIDE MORE DETAILED FEEDBACK TO MY COMMON STATE WILL BE FAIRLY HIGH LEVEL. FIRST AND FOREMOST WE BELIEVE ROBUST PRIVACY PROTECTIONS APPLY UNDER EXISTING STATE AND FEDERAL LAW AROUND THE NOTICE COLLECTION USE AND DISCLOSURE OF STUDENT OUR EDUCATIONAL INFORMATION. INCLUDING THE TWENTY SIXTEEN STUDENT ON MY PERSONAL INFORMATION AND PROTECTION ACT OR OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE PEP UP. CALIFORNIANS ALSO ENJOYS STRONG PRIVACY PROTECTIONS UNDER THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND AMENDMENTS TO THAT ACT BY THE VOTER APPROVED PRIVACY RIGHTS ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY WHICH THIS BILL NOW SIX DEMAND. NOTABLY EXISTING CCK PROTECTIONS APPLY EQUALLY TO ALL TYPES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION AND SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION IRRESPECTIVE OF THE TYPE OF INDUSTRY COLLECTING IT. AND USING THAT INFORMATION WITHOUT REGARD TO THE PARTICULAR TECHNOLOGY USED IF ANY TO COLLECT THAT INFORMATION STATED ANOTHER WAY AS THIS COMMITTEE KNOWS VERY WELL. THE LAW WAS PURPOSEFULLY DESIGNED NOT TO TAKE A COMPREHENSIVE TECHNOLOGY NEUTRALAND INDUSTRY NEUTRAL APPROACH TO PROTECTING CONSUMER DATA PRIVACY RIGHTS. AND IT WAS DONE SO WITH A LIMITED PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION FOR DATA BREACHES. IN CONTRAST THIS NOW SIX TEMAS. TEN ACCIDENT KILLING STRINGENT. RESTRICTIONS THAT GO BEYOND THE- NECESSARY STANDARD. USED FOR DATA MINIMIZATION PROVISIONS APPLYING TO SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION. AND ADDS A NEW PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. AND THESE ARE ONLY FOR COMPANIES THAT PROVIDE PROMPTING SERVICES IN AN EDUCATIONAL SETTING AND EVEN OR THE P. I. IS DE IDENTIFIED OR AGGREGATE CONSUMER DATA. SUCH CHANGES SHARPLY DEVIATE FROM THE EXISTING STRUCTURE AND OPERATIONS CPRE. AND WE'RE CHIEFLY CONCERNED AT THIS BILL SIGNALING A RETURN TO THE PRE TWENTY EIGHTEEN PIECEMEAL APPROACH TO ESTABLISHING PRIVATE FOR PRIVACY PROTECTIONS DEPEND ON THE TYPE OF INDUSTRY. DATA OR TECHNOLOGY INVOLVED. WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THIS IS LARGELY OUT OF A DESIRE TO ADD NEW PRIVATE RIGHTS OF ACTION MOVING FORWARD TO THE SEA CARE A. WERE ONLY A LIMITED ONE EXISTS TODAY. ULTIMATELY WE BELIEVE THAT REVERTING TO PICKING AND CHOOSING CERTAIN TYPES OF DATA INDUSTRY OR TECHNOLOGY SWITCHED A PIE INDIVIDUALIZE RULES. WILL ONLY UNDERMINE THE EFFICACY OF THAT LANDMARK PRIVACY LAW. AS SUCH RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE SB. ELEVEN SEVENTY TWO THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS CORPS ENGINE WITH RUNNING AROUND GOVERNMENT IF. ON THE OF C. JACK ADDRESSING THE COMMITTEE TODAY WITH CONCERNS ABOUT THE IMPACT SB ELEVEN SEVENTY TWO WOULD HAVE ON BUSINESS LIABILITY IN CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW CONSUMER TO BRING A CIVIL ACTION AGAINST A BUSINESS COLLECTING RETAINING USING OR DISCLOSING PERSONAL INFORMATION GATHERED ONE OFFERING PROCTOR RING SERVICES. I MUST AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE CHAMBER THAT THIS BILL IS CHIPPING AWAY- IT CONTINUES TO CHIP AWAY OF VOTER APPROVED TREATMENT OF DATA UNDER EXISTING PRIVACY LAWS. AND TWENTY TWENTY CALIFORNIA VOTERS PASSED PROP TWENTY FOUR AND WHAT. WITH IT A BROAD FRAMEWORK FOR HOW PERSONAL AND SENSITIVE INFORMATION WAS TO BE HANDLED BY BUSINESSES. REGARDLESS OF INDUSTRY TYPE OR SERVICES. WHY NOW BEFORE THE GOVERNING AGENCY HAS EVEN RELEASED RULES AROUND COMPLIANCE WITH THIS NEW PRIVACY LAW. IS IT NECESSARY TO EXPAND LIABILITY FOR THOSE PROVIDING PROMPTING SERVICES. VOTERS HAVE ALREADY APPROVED A LIMITED ACTION UNDER EXISTING PRIVACY LAW THAT DOES NOT SINGLE OUT SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES OR SERVICES LET'S ALLOW TIME FOR RULEMAKING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT LAW PRIOR TO ADDING ON. ADDITIONAL AN UNNECESSARILY UNNECESSARY LIABILITY FOR THOSE REASONS SEJAK MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. REMOVE ON TO OTHERS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL.

AFTER CARRYING REPRESENTING JERSEY BRADLEY U. S. SENATE AND STRONGLY OPPOSE. WELL AT ELEVEN SEVEN TWO WE BELIEVE IN THE RIGHTS OF PRIVACY AND THAT'S THE GOAL THANK YOU VERY FRAZIER FONG LAST WEEK THE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MA'AM NEXT PLEASE HI THIS BILL. THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT AT THIS TIME. VERY GOOD WE WILL NOW BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO MEMBERS ARE THERE ANY CENTER HERTZBERG. YEAH- I SPENT MORE HUNDREDS OF HOURS NEGOTIATING- WHATEVER THESE THINGS THE FIRST ONE ON THE BALLOT FIRST ONE OFF THE BALLOT AND THE SECOND ONE ON THE BATH YOU KNOW TOP TWENTY FOUR. AND IT WAS TOUGH. VERY TOUGH BECAUSE UNLIKE INDUSTRIES OR YOU HAVE LIKE LABOR AGAINST MANAGEMENT THE LINES ARE PRETTY CLEAR OR THE DOCTORS AGAINST THE LAWYERS AND THE LIKE AND IT WAS CLEAR YOU KNOW THE KANA EASIER- POSITIONS YOU DON'T I MEAN WHEN YOU HAVE THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. THIS WAS VERY DIFFERENT BECAUSE- ALL THESE COMPANIES THAT HAVE SOUGHT TO MONETIZE THE INTERNET HAS DONE IT IN DIFFERENT WAYS I CAN NAME SPECIFIC COMPANIES IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO IS HARD FOR THEM ON THE ONE HAND. TO TRY TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT ABOUT HERE'S WHAT WE WANT VERSE THE CONSUMER GROUPS RIGHT AND- AND THE CONSUMER GROUPS BUT WE GET IT WILL GIVE US A LIST OF FORTY ONE THINGS WERE GIVEN TWENTY SEVEN OF THE THINGS IN THE GROCERY ASIANS BUT YOU KNOW THEY- DIDN'T UP SOME OF THE NAP SUPPORTING OF SOME OF THEM DID. BUT THE THING THAT WAS THE MOST AGO SHEETED THING HERE WHICH I WANT TO TALK ABOUT. WAS THE WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO IMPLEMENT THE LAW. OKAY EXISTS ALSO GOES TO MR MAKOWSKI IS MEASURED HERE TO. WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO IMPLEMENT THE LAW. ARE WE GOING TO ALLOW WE GO THROUGH ALL THIS HEARTACHE TO GET SOMETHING PASSED BY THE VOTERS AND THEN THE LEGISLATURE CAN CHANGE IT IN ANY WAY WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO BE GUARDRAILS OR NOT WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE IT WE DON'T TIME WE GET IN TAX POLICY WITHOUT LABOR POLICY. WEALL SORTS OF THINGS AND SO ONE OF THOSE GUARD RAILS LOOK LIKE. IS THE BIGGEST ISSUE QUITE FRANKLY LOOK HELLO THE HIP AT THE PARK RECEIVE IT OFF. BECAUSE I JUST WAS HERE TO. TO GET. PRIVATE FACTION BILL. BUT THAT WAS BASED UPON A DEEPLY WAS DIFFERENT THIS WAS NEGOTIATED DEAL. AND SO I JUST WANT TO REFERENCE THIS BECAUSE I DON'T SUPPORT THIS BUT WAS SUPPORT WITH WITH WITH SOME. QUALIFICATION I THINK YOU KNOW IN THE DISCUSSION AS WE ENGAGE IN PRIVACY GOING FORWARD I'M GONNA BE GONE IN TEN SECONDS OUT OF THE SHOP AND- THEY'LL BE SOMEBODY ELSE NEW SITTING IN THIS SEAT. BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE SOME OF THE INSTITUTIONAL MEMORY AND IN THAT REGARD. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS ONE OF THE- BIGGEST ISSUES THAT WAS NEGOTIATED AMONG EVERYBODY. WAS IMPLEMENTATION IN THE WORDS THE BALANCE OUT THE PROTECTION FOR CONSUMERS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. BUT GOING FORWARD HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY THEY WERE GONNA HAVE. AND HERE WAS THE DEAL THAT WAS THE BIGGEST PIECE SECTION. IS C. PARAGRAPH SIX. THE LAW SHOULD BE AMENDED IF NECESSARY TO IMPROVE ITS OPERATIONS. PROVIDED THAT THE AMENDMENTS DO NOT COMPROMISE. OR WEAKENED CONSUMER PRIVACY. AB CRITICAL THE- APPROACH TO ADOPT FOUR WAS NO WEAKENING OF CONSUMER PRIVACY WHILE GIVING ATTENTION TO THE IMPACT ON BUSINESS AND INNOVATION. AND MY SUGGESTION AND TRYING TO READ THIS INTO THE RECORD FROM MY EXPERIENCE WAS THAT THIS WAS THE LANGUAGE IT WAS TOUGH. BECAUSE BUSINESSES OH MY GOD IF YOU GET OUT THERE AND CREATE THESE CHILLING EFFECT WITH ALL THESE NEW LAWS THAT THEN. EVERYBODY COULD SUE US UNDER PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THAT MAY HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT ON INNOVATION AND THAT WAS WHERE THE DELICATE BALANCE WAS. AND I DON'T ANSWER I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION YOU WITH RESPECT TO SENATOR PANTS MEASURE OR CENTER WOULD HOUSE THESE MEASUREMENTS SUPPORT THEM BOTH TODAY. BUT I WANT TO PUT THAT IN THE NATION OUT THERE BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT- THEY HAVE HONOR INTEGRITY TO. WHAT WAS DISCUSSED AMONG ALL THE PARTIES NOW OBVIOUSLY FUTURE LEGISLATORS COULD DO WHAT THEY WANT. THEY CAN INTERPRET ANYWAY THEY DEEM APPROPRIATE. BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE THAT LEVEL OF HISTORY IN THEIR STANDING OF WHAT HAPPENED. AND ALL OF THE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF HOURS OF NEGOTIATION AND WHY THIS WAS IMPORTANT AND- DOES THIS GREAT THAT CHILLING AFFECT WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF. BALANCING THE CRITICAL MESSAGE THE SAYS YOU EXPAND CONSUMER RIGHTS WELL NOT HAVING A CHILLING EFFECT ON INNOVATION SO WITH THAT. I WANTED TO. POINT THAT OUT TO THE HISTORY TO THE COMMITTEE. FROM SOMEBODY WHO WAS A PERCIPIENT WITNESS SOME TWELVE HUNDRED YEARS AGO. AND YEAH THAT SURE THAT WITH BUT WAS SUPPORTED BUT WITH THE ADMONITION THAT- I WOULD HOLD THE RIGHT TO WEAR. YOU KNOW DEAL WITH IT LATER. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS FROM THE COMMITTEE. I DON'T SEE ANYBODY WITH ANY CONCERNS I HAVE SOME CONCERNS IN REGARDS TO THE- C. P. R. R. A. AND- AND THE NEED TO START MAKING EXCEPTIONS TO THAT- FOR. THE NEED TO ADD TO IT WHEN IT REALLY HASN'T BECOME EFFECTIVE YET AS A TOOL- IN THE TOOL BOX AND IN ADDITION TO THAT THE NEED FOR. A THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION WHAT Y. EIGHT Y. E. THAT IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL YEAH. THE QUESTION AND- SO THANK YOU CENTERS FOR THE HISTORY LESSON ALTHOUGH I THINK I WAS AROUND THE SAME TIME SO I GUESS WE'RE BOTH TWELVE HUNDRED YEARS. OLD SO- I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS SOMEONE EMPHASIZE WHICH ENSURED THAT YOU RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS A- I WILL SAY UNIQUE BUT THIS IS A VULNERABLE POPULATION RIGHT THESE ARE STUDENTS AND THEY DON'T HAVE A CHOICE. THEY HAVE TO DOUBTS AND THE PROCTOR IN COMPANY IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT THEY CHOSE SO THEY DIDN'T CHOOSE TO USE THIS COMPANY- THE SCHOOL OR WHOEVER YOU KNOW WHICHEVER THE THAT THAT TESTAMENTARY SAID YOU SHALL USE THIS PRODUCT AND COMPANY- AND- WHATEVER TRACKING COMPANY WANTS FROM YOU. YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU CAN'T TAKE THE EXAM AND THAT EXAM MAY BE IN MANY CASES- MOST OF US THERE'S- THE EXAMS ARE PRETTY CRITICAL EIGHT OUT WE CAN'T SAY OH WELL I WILL TAKE THE EXAM THEN RIGHT. SO WE HAVE ESSENTIALLY A POPULATION A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE. VULNERABLE BECAUSE THEY THEY THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE A CHOICE UNLESS THEY WANT TO GIVE UP THAT CAREER PATH OR WHATEVER THAT EXAM IS GOING TO LEAD TO. I THINK THAT CREATES THAT CREATES A PARTICULAR SITUATION AND ALSO THE PRICING COMPANY DOESN'T HAVE. ANY BUILT THEY CAN ASK FOR WHATEVER THEY WANT AND THERE'S NO LIMITATIONS THERE. AND SO THAT'S WHAT THE SEE THIS BILL SEEKS TO DO IS TO SAY **** YOU SHOULD BE COLLECTING ALL THE INFORMATION YOU CAN TRY TO GET YOU SHOULD BE TO COLLECTING JUST WHAT YOU NEED. AND ALSO WE NEED TO BE SO AGAIN TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY. BECAUSE AND THEN ALSO HOW LONG YOU HERE HANG ON TO THE DATA BECAUSE OF SOMEONE HACKS-YOUR DATABASE. ARE YOU COLLECTING LL THIS BIOMETRIC DATA AND SOMEONE GETS THAT DATA- I HOPE YOU'RE NOT SELLING IT BUT IF SOMEONE GETS THAT DATA THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN SWITCH OUT YOUR EYEBALL IN THE FUTURE IF SOMEONE REYES STOLE YOU KNOW YOUR IDENTITY YOU NAME WITH. THE PHOTOMETRIC DATA RIGHT THAT IT'S LOST FOREVER IT'S AND IT'S NOW AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE FOREVER. SO I THINK THERE'S PARTICULARLY ONLY TALKING AND MOBILE POPULATION PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE AND WE NEED TO BE SURE THEY GIVE THEM RECOURSE L. I. I. EASEMENT I'M NOT A PERSON IS REALLY INTO PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION I'D USUALLY I'M THE ONE PEOPLE SAYS WELL. BUILT FRAMED ACTION I'M NOT SUPPORTING IT. HE'S OF A- YES- BUT I THINK IN THIS IN THE GALLATIN FOR CASE- AND CERTAINLY WANT TO WORK WITH OPPOSITE SO- YOU KNOW WORK WITH THE TEAM AND CJ AND SO FORTH- AND A PRIEST APPRECIATE THAT ACTUALLY WON THE MAJOR CONTRACTING COMPANIES ACTUALLY SUPPORTING THIS BILL BECAUSE I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO INNOVATION. THEY RECOGNIZE THE INNOVATION IS GOING TO BE ON HOW DO I COLLECT MORE AND MORE DATA ON PEOPLE THE INNOVATIONS HOW CAN I ACTUALLY DO A BETTER JOB PRACTICING AND DO IT BETTER WITHOUT ACTUALLY NEEDING MORE MORE INFORMATION THAT PUTS POTENTIALLY CAN PUT THE TEST TAKER AT RISK THAT THE COMPANY HAS TO NOT HAVE TO USE IT YOU'LL HAVE TO HAVE AS MUCH INFORMATION TO BE ABLE TO STILL DO THE JOB AND- AND THEN AGAIN OF COURSE THEIR CUSTOMERS ACTUALLY THE- TEST ADMINISTRATOR TO SCHOOL OR WHATEVER BODIES THE TEST ADMINISTRATOR AND THAT'S THE OPPORTUNITY FOR INNOVATION. SO THE L. A. I DO THINK THAT WE BECAUSE THE END OF ALL THE POPULATION THE NEED HAVE RECOURSE- SO WE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT THE NATURE OF THE P. R. A. BUT- YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE- THE PERSON WHO IS AFFECTED- FOOD BY THE WAY IS NOW THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMPANY IS NOT ONE THAT THEY CHOSE GOOD SIR FORCED UPON THEM. IS IN A PARTICULARLY HORRIBLE SITUATION THEY NEED TO HAVE THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO- TO BE ABLE TO GET RE COMPANY SENSE IF THEY'RE IF THEY'RE INJURED OR DAMAGED BY APPRECIATE THAT AND I AND I DID HEAR THEIR UNWILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT. THE THAT IT IT'S RIGHT IN THE END AND I'LL SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY AND LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU KNOW HOW IT CHANGES IN I DO I AM SENSITIVE TO THE ISSUE OF HERE'S WHO YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH AND HERE'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT AND I THINK YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IT'S A VULNERABLE POPULATION WITH NO VERY LIMITED CHOICE SO. PRECIADO THANK YOU. THANK YOU SAN CABALLERO ALL RIGHT OTHER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SO. OVER CHAIR- SIR WOULD LIKE CLOSE AT ALL I'M SORRY THE NEMO IS THERE.

I REMEMBER FOURTEEN. THANK YOU RICHARD MEMBERS- AND I HOPE THAT MY- FIRST FRANK THE BANKRUPTCY BILL TO MOVE ON CONSENT WAS. HELLO HELLO US OF REPEATING- THEME TRYING THIS BILL BUT YOU KNOW I'M HERE 2% ON- TEN NINETY NINE. IN THIS ACTUALLY REPRESENTS MY CAPSTONE LEGISLATION IN THE SPACE OF BANKRUPTCY UPDATES IN CALIFORNIA LAW KEY AMONG THE BILL'S UPDATES IS HIGHLIGHTED IN THAT VERY GOOD STAFF REPORT IS ALLOWS THE DEBTOR TO KEEP A MODEST USE ME VEHICLE. ITS CREDITORS FROM TAKING A CAR FROM CONSUMERS IN BANKRUPTCY WHEN THEY'RE CURRENT ON THEIR PAYMENTS AND REMOVED DISINCENTIVES FOR TRUSTEES TO HOLD ON TO SOMEBODY'S HOUSE WELL THE PRICE THE EQUITY BUILDS UP DURING THE PENDENCY OF THE BANKRUPTCY CASE TO INCREASE THE SALE VALUE. CAN RELATE TONIGHT A CONSUMER THE FRESH START WHICH WITH ME TODAY IS KATHY MORAN FROM THE RAND LAW GROUP AND I CUMAN WITH THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS. OF CONSUMER BANKRUPTCY ATTORNEYS I URGE AN AYE VOTE. ALL RIGHT MISS MORAN ARE YOU PRESENT TELEPHONICALLY. ARE YOU HERE. ALL RIGHT THE FLOOR IS YOURS. AT.

THIRTY FIVE SPECIALIST IN BANKRUPTCY WITH FORTY TWO YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN THE SPACE- THE% AND I'M A STRONG SUPPORTER OF THE AD EDITIONS TO SAFETY NET THAT THE BANKRUPTCY AND EXEMPTIONS PROVIDE THE CALIFORNIA DEBTORS I WANT TO TALK ABOUT. TWO PARTICULAR. PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL THE FIRST BEING THE EXPANSION. OF THE EXEMPTION. OF FREE A PRE. IN AN ASSET THAT IS THE EXAM. THE BANKRUPTCY LAW PROVIDES AN EXEMPTION SIR TO TERMINATE ON THE DATE OF FILING- BUT YOU WEAR THAT THAT NUMBER IS SIX AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CASE. WE IN OUR CURRENT MARKET WE SEE RAPID THE POSSIBILITY OF RAPID APPRECIATION DURING THE BANKRUPTCY CASE. OF THE BANKRUPTCY CASE MAY GO ON FOR MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS AT THE DETERMINATION OF THE BANKRUPTCY TRUSTEE AND THE DEBTOR HAS NO- CONTROL OVER HOW LONG THE CASE. GOES FORWARD THIS BILL WOULD BE IT. FIFTY FIVE EXEMPTION TO BE P. P. EXCEPT OUT YOU ON THE OF THE FILING AND ANY APPRECIATION THAT OCCURS DURING THE- COURSE OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE CASE. SB WOULD PRETEND THE TRUSTEES. FROM SPECULATING IN REAL IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S REAL ESTATE BYE BYE PROLONGING ARE DELAYING THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE CASE IN THE HOPES THAT AT A HOUSE THAT WAS FULLY EXEMPT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CASE. WILL APPRECIATE FACTS THAT THE THAT THE TRUSTEE CAN. PUT THE HOUSE ON THE MARKET AND IT AND SELL IT OUT FROM. UNDER THE DEBTOR. AND I THOUGHT THIS IN EVERY. K. FOR IN MY OFFICE WHERE THE DEBTORS. X. OF. EXEMPT EQUITY EQUALED BLUES THE DEBT PLUS THE EXEMPTION BUT INSTEAD IT WAS NOT ABLE TO THE FINAL BANKRUPTCY FOR FEAR THAT IN THE MONTHS THAT THE CASE MIGHT GO ON THE MARKET GOES UP AND HE WOULD FIND AT THE HOUSE THAT WAS FULLY EXEMPT AND AVAILABLE TO HIM AND HIS FAMILY FOR A FRESH START ALL OF A SUDDEN BECOMES- FODDER FOR A SALE BY A BANKRUPTCY TRUSTEE. I THINK THIS DESCRIPTION. PROVIDE CERTAINTY ENDED. CONSISTENCY WITH IDEA THAT IT. ARE A STEP ON THE DAY OF THE- AND- BETTER NOT FEAR. THE. HE ASIAN THAT MIGHT.

AND NOW WE'RE LOOKING TO INCREASE IT EVEN MORE BY TAPPING OR BY ALLOWING THE- APPRECIATION ON A HOME AFTER BANKRUPTCY HAS BEEN FILED- THAT'S NOT FORGET THAT THE DEBTORS DOES OWE THE MONEY TO WERE THE CREDITORS.

FUNDS THAT CAN GO BACK TO CREDITORS WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING LARGE CREDIT CARD COMPANIES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SMALL BUSINESSES. PEOPLE WHO ARE ABLE TO RECEIVE SOMETHING THROUGH A JUDGMENT.

ELEVEN EIGHTY NINE CONCERNING BIOMETRIC INFORMATION BY CENTER WACO SKI. YES MR AND MEMBERS FIRST LET ME START OFF BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS HAS- BY THE COMMITTEE AS OUTLINED IN OUR ANALYSIS AND THINK TO CONSULT FOR WORKING WITH- MY OFFICE AND THIS. AS CENTER HERTZBERG. INTE INDICATED INCENTER PANS BILL WE HOPE TO TWEAK IT THAT NICE BALANCE HERE OF IN S. B. ELEVEN EIGHTY NINE OF PROTECTING CONSUMER PRIVACY EXPANDING ON IT BY REQUIRING THAT PRIVATE ENTITIES A TEAM AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT BEFORE COLLECTING AND DISCLOSING THIS BIOMETRIC INFORMATION IT FURTHER PROHIBITS PRIVATE ENTITIES FROM SELLING TRADING AND USING FOR ADVERTISING PURPOSES OR OTHERWISE PROFITEERING FROM THE DISCLOSURE OF PERSON'S BIOMETRIC INFORMATION HIT THE CONSENT YOU CAN USE THE INFORMATION BIOMETRIC INFORMATION INVOLVES IMMUTABLE AND HIGHLY DISTINCTIVE TRAITS SUCH AS THE RICHES OF YOUR FINGERNAILS. THE TEXTURE AND COLOR FOR YOUR SKIN'S THE GEOMETRIC ATTRIBUTES OF YOUR FACE THESE ARE TRAITS FULL COMPLETE TIED TO YOUR PERSONAL IDENTITIES UNLIKE A PASSWORD OR PIN CODE WHEN COMPROMISED- LEAGUE BIOMETRICS CAN EASILY BE CHANGED THIS UNIQUENESS IS PART OF WHAT MAKES BIOMETRIC. INFORMATION SO VALUABLE BIOMETRICS CAN BE USED TO AUTHENTICATE IDENTIFICATION PINPOINT INDIVIDUALS FROM A ROOF VERY LARGE CROWD AND EVEN TRACK YOUR MOVEMENT IN OTHER WORDS BY MEXICO RICK BIOMETRIC INFORMATION FAT FASTLY EMPOWERS SURVEILLANCE TOOLS. ALTHOUGH THIS MAY HAVE SECURITY BENEFITS IT'S CRITICAL TO CONSIDER HOW WIDESPREAD USE THE BIOMETRIC IMPACTS ON FREE SPEECH AND FREE ASSOCIATION AND OTHER CORNERSTONES OF OUR DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY CAN BE AND HOW THIS OFTEN DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS MINORITY COMMUNITIES. ALSO CONCERNING IS THAT THESE PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS MAY GIVE COMPANIES THE ABILITYTO FIND OUT OUR PREFERENCES AND OUR EMOTIONS ALTHOUGH THE TECHNOLOGY IS FAR FROM PERFECT MANY COMPANIES ARE INVESTING HEAVILY IN EMOTION DETECTION AND RECOGNITION SOFTWARE. AMAZON FOR INSTANCE HAS OUR OWN PROPRIETARY RECOGNITION SOFTWARE DUBBED AMAZON RECOGNITION AND APPLE PURCHASED EMOTION IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ACCOMPANIED IT LOOKS TO ESTIMATE THE MOTION FROM YOUR FACIAL PRINCE. IT MAY SOUND SCIENCE LIKE SCIENCE FICTION BUT LET ME ASSURE YOU THAT BIOMETRICS ARE EX ARE ACTIVELY BEING INCORPORATED INTO THE ACTIVITIES SUCH AS JOB RECRUITMENT DRIVING FINANCING AND EVEN MARKETING A NUMBER OF TECHNOLOGY FIRMS HAVE PARTNERED WITH PRIVATE COMPANIES TO ANALYZE. THE FACE THE FACES OF JOB APPLICANTS AND FOR. EMOTION OR PERSONALITY TRAITS AND FINALLY I MENTIONED AT THE START TECHNOLOGY IS FAR FROM PERFECT S. IS TO IS FAR TOO OFTEN THE CASE WHEN THE TECHNOLOGY- DOES FIELD IT TENDS TO HURT PEOPLE OF COLOR AND MINORITY COMMUNITIES THE MOST. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN JUST AS ONE EXAMPLE- GENTLEMAN NIGER PARKS OF NEW JERSEY WAS WRONGFULLY ARRESTED. AFTER BEING MISIDENTIFIED BY FACIAL RECOGNITION SYSTEM DESPITE BEING THIRTY MILES AWAY FROM THE SCENE OF THE ALLEGED CRIME PARK SPENT TEN DAYS IN JAIL BEFORE POLICE ADMITTED THEIR MISTAKE MISTER PARKS IS AT LEAST THE THIRD PERSON. TO BE FALSELY ARRESTED DUE TO A FAULTY FACIAL RECOGNITION SYSTEM AND ALL THREE THE OTHERS WERE A BLACK MAN THIS IS NOT A ONE OFF PROBLEM IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. A TWENTY EIGHTEEN STUDY. SHOWED THAT FACE IDENTIFICATION SYSTEMS MISIDENTIFIED WOMEN OF COLOR AT MORE THAN FORTY TIMES TO READ OF WHITE MEN RESEARCHERS HAVE ALSO SHOWN THAT FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE INTERPRETS BLACK FACES IS HAVING MORE NEGATIVE EMOTION THEY MIGHT FACES IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT BIOMETRICS ARE OFTEN FED INTO ALGORITHMS- THAT REPRODUCE SOCIETAL PREJUDICES. IT'S THE REASON WHY ALL RHYTHMS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO DISPROPORTIONATELY ADVERTISE HIGH PAYING JOBS TO MEN OVER WOMEN AND WHILE MORTGAGE APPROVAL L. CORRECT THEM CENTER. PEOPLE OF COLOR. IT'S ALSO THE REASON WHY WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WHEN IT COMES TO SOMETHING SO SENSITIVE AS OUR BIOMETRIC INFORMATION CIVIC. SUFFICIENT GUARDRAILS- EMPATE PLACE IT'S AS IF STAFF REPORT PARTS POINTS OUT THIS IS A FASTLY DEVELOPING INDUSTRY AND THEY EXPECTING FOR FIVE YEARS TO REVENUES AT THEM OR THE MARKET TO REACH EIGHTY TWO POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. SO IT'S NOT. THE INTENTION OF ELEVEN EIGHTY NINE TO HAMPER TECHNOLOGY TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION IS THAT REPRESENT THAT AREA INSTEAD ELEVEN EIGHTY NINE LOOKS TO ENSURE THAT GUARD RAILS ARE IN PLACE. AND ENSURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE A SAY IN HOW THE DADDY ISSUES AND A MEANS OF DEFENDING THEMSELVES WHEN THAT SAY IS TAKEN AWAY AND HERE TO TESTIFY IS ADAM SCHWARTZ A SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY FOR THE EXTRAS FRONTIER FOUNDATION I URGE YOUR SUPPORT. SO SIR BECAUSE YOU JUST TO BE CLEAR YOU ACCEPTED THE- COMMITTEE MEMBERS EVERYONE OF THEM EVERYONE OF THEM AND ALSO JUST TO BE CLEAR THIS DOES NOT PROHIBIT FOR EXAMPLE FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY IT DOES NOT ARE. OKAY SO- MISTER SCHWARTZ IF YOU'RE HERE. AS MISTER ALL RIGHT THERE YOU GO GO AHEAD. HI ON BEHALF OF THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION AND ARE THOUSANDS OF MEMBERS ACROSS THE STATE THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY TODAY IN FLORIDA SB ELEVEN EIGHTY NINE. MANY THANKS ALSO TO SENATOR LIKE HOUSEKEEPER INTRODUCING IT THE BILL WOULD PLACE COMMONSENSE LIMITS ON HOW PRIVATE ENTITIES PROCESS BIOMETRIC INFORMATION. I ADDRESS OUR EIGHT THREATEN TO PERSON PRIVACY RACIAL JUSTICE FREAKS BY GO IT IS FOR A PEOPLE CAPTURE OUR BIOMETRICS SUCH AS OUR PAPER AND WHITE PLAINS. WHAT HAPPENS WITH CHANGE OR BUYING METRICS UNLIKE A CREDIT CARD NUMBERS OR EVEN OUR NAMES. BETTER BY MEASURE TO BE USED TO IDENTIFY AND TRACK US AND DRAW INFERENCES ABOUT US. WHAT WE CAN DO IT INDIVIDUAL TO PROTECT. OURSELVES FROM BIOMETRIC SURVEILLANCE. THE COMPANY. A. I. HAS COLLECTED FIFTY FROM BILLIONS OF PEOPLE TO BE. WITHOUT PERMISSION AND NOW WANT TO GET A PRINT FROM EVERY PERSON ON EARTH. THE SELF THE SERVICE IDENTIFYING SUSPECTS FOR EXAMPLE POLICE PAID CLEAR VIEW TO IDENTIFY A. B. L. M. PROTESTER PROBLEM HERE IS THE COLLECTION OF PATRONS WITHOUT OPTION CONSENT PEOPLE TO PROTEST AND FROM THE PUBLIC AT LARGE. CONSIDER THE CASE OF LET ME- ROBINSON AFRICAN AMERICAN T. PUBLIC SKATING RINK CHECK AROUND BECAUSE THEY COLLECT A FACE PRINT FROM EVERY PATRON AND MISIDENTIFIED HER IF SOMEONE ELSE. IS TECHNOLOGIES MAKE MISTAKES ESPECIALLY OUT TO WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR AS SENATOR WHITE HOUSE HE EXPLAINED. ALSO THESE CAN BE THERE COULD BE DISCRIMINATION AND THE TECHNOLOGIES ARE POINTED. APPLE EIGHT WRITER STUDY FOUND THAT A DRUG STORE CHAIN RITE AID BUT FAR MORE LIKELY TO SCREEN PATRONS WITH FACE RECOGNITION AT THE STORE IS LOCATED IN LOWER INCOME. AND NON WHITE NEIGHBORHOODS- AND HIGHER INCOME AND WHITE NEIGHBORHOODS. ALL OF US TO BE ABLE TO WALK INTO A STORE WITHOUT THE MANAGEMENT TAKING OUR BIOMETRICS WITHOUT OUR PERMISSION IT HELPS MATCHING UP AGAINST THE LIST OF UNWANTED PATRONS. ALL THE PROBLEMS SB ELEVEN EIGHTY NINE WOULD REQUIRE PRIVATE ENTITIES TO DO FOUR THINGS FIRST. OBTAIN OPT IN CONSENT FROM THE PERSON BEFORE COLLECTING THEIR BIOMETRIC OR DISPOSING THEM. SECOND THE STORE THE FINAL TRICKS THIRD DON'T TELL THE FINAL TRICKS AND FOURTH WEEK OF I. WITH A YEAR. THE PROVIDE FOR CONSUMER ENFORCED OF THE FOR. SB EIGHTY NINE IS MY ON THE OTHER SIDE NATURE INFORMATION PRIVACY OKAY BACK. THE MOST IMPORTANT PRIVATE STATUTE IN THE COUNTRY. TIME TO COME BRING IT PROTECT TO THE OF CALIFORNIA. I THANK YOU VERY BRIEF ADDRESSED TO CONSERVE RAISED ABOUT BILL FIRST THE NATIONAL PAYROLL REPORTING CONSORTIUM HAD SUGGESTED THE BILL WILL ADVERSELY IMPACT BIOMETRIC TIME CLOCKS. PEOPLE PUNCHING IN WITH A CONFERENCE FOR EXAMPLE. THE BILL EMPLOYERS TO CONDITION APPOINTMENT ON COLLECTION AND DISCLOSURE OF BIOMETRICS ALONG WITH THE EMPLOYEE SIGNED A WRITTEN RELEASE. NOTICE AND RELEASE FORMS HAVE ALREADY BEEN DEVELOPED BY BOTH VENDORS AND EMPLOYERS. LAWYER IS GOING TO PROCESS ITS EMPLOYEES BY METRICS IT'S REASONABLE TO NOTE REQUIRE ALSO NOTICED SECURE STORAGE AND OTHER SALES OF THIS INFORMATION BUT CONSENT IS NOT REQUIRED FROM EMPLOYEES. SECOND THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HAS RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT CONSUMER ENFORCEMENT. ENFORCEMENT IS A STANDARD FEATURE OF FEDERAL AND OTHER PRIVACY LEGISLATION. WITHOUT IT SUCH LAWS GO UNENFORCED FOR EXAMPLE IT TOOK THE TEXAS ATTORNEY GENERAL YOU'RE THE THIRTEEN YEARS DURING ITS FIRST ACTION TO ENFORCE THAT STATE BIOMETRIC PRIVACY LAW AND ACTION WHICH OF THE COPYCATS OF SUCCESSFUL CONSUMER LITIGATION UNDER. ALSO THE STATUTORY DAMAGES IN SB ELEVEN EIGHTY NINE ARE MUCH LOWER THAN OTHER ONE HUNDRED TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS PER THOUSAND A FIVE TO. SO AGAIN WE ASK FOR YOUR YES VOTE ON SB ELEVEN EIGHTY NINE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU MISTER SCHWARTZ ANYONE ELSE HERE IN ROOM TWELVE HUNDRED WAS TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF S. B. ELEVEN EIGHTY NINE SEEING KNOWN APPROACHING THE MICROPHONE BUT- IF YOU WOULD QUEUE UP THOSE ON THE PHONE. WHO WISH TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB ELEVEN EIGHTY NINE.

THANK YOU I WON FIFTY EIGHT PRECOURT. THE NUTCRACKER THE CONSUMER JOURNEY OF THE CALIFORNIA TERMS THE COURT THANK YOU. THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT THINK. ALL RIGHT LET'S NOT TURN TO THE OPPOSITION I SEE- MISTER. DILLON HOFFMAN AND RONAK- DAYLAMI YES SIR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN PERSON THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR RIGHT NOT DAYLAMI AGAIN WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSITION TO SB ELEVEN EIGHTY NINE AS A JOB KILLER. BASED ON WHAT WE'VE ALREADY SEEN WITH THE ILLINOIS BIOMETRIC INFORMATION PRIVACY ACT WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THIS BILL POTENTIALLY ELIMINATE CONSUMER PRODUCTS OR SERVICES EXPERTS COMPANIES A COSTLY CLASS ACTIONS BASED ON TECHNICAL VIOLATIONS WITHOUT ANY SHOW OF HARM AND LIMIT THEIR WORK FORCE. AND AUTHORIZING WHAT WE CAN ONLY DESCRIBE AS A POTENTIALLY CRIPPLING PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION WE BELIEVE THIS BILL EFFECTIVELY AND UNNECESSARILY CIRCUMVENTS THE PURPOSEFUL PUBLIC POLICY DECISION TO ESTABLISH A LIMITED PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION UNDER THE CCPA FOR DATA BREACHES OF PROTECTED PERSONAL INFORMATION. SIMPLY STATED WE SEE NO NEED TO ENACT A SECONDARY STATUTES GOVERNING BIOMETRICS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LET ALONE ONE WITH SENSE WITH SUCH EXTENSIVE LIABILITY ATTACHED AT THIS TIME- PARTICULARLY WHEN THE SECURITY IS NOT YET FULLY IN EFFECT TONIGHT. REALLY QUICKLY JUST WANT TO KNOW OF ALL THE STATES THAT HAPPENED A STATUTES COURSE EASY PAY TYPE STATUTE ONLY ILLINOIS HAS A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. PLEASE BEAR IN MIND ILLINOIS ENACTED THAT PASSED THE TIME WHEN SMARTPHONES WERE AMONG THE NEWEST TECHNOLOGY A FULL DECADE BEFORE THE STATE PASSED ITS LANDMARK DATA PRIVACY PROTECTION LAW THE CCPA. AS WE PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED THE C. P. C. C. C. PH. REPRESENTED A MASSIVE PUBLIC POLICY SHIFT IN THE STATE TO PROTECT ALL. PERSONAL INFORMATION INCLUDING BIOMETRIC INFORMATION AND A COMPREHENSIVE TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL AND INDUSTRY NEUTRAL MANNER TO BE CLEAR STATES THAT HAVE A PROPOSED THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE PRIVACY LAWS LIKE THE CCPA. THIS IS A HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE LAW DO NOT HAVE IT BUT THE ONE OR TWO. NOR DO THEY NEED ONE EXCUSE ME. IN ADDITION CONCERNS AROUND THE OVERLY BROAD DEFINITION OF BIOMETRIC INFORMATION THAT CAPTURES DATA NOT USED TO IDENTIFY A PERSON THE LACK OF REASONABLE EXEMPTIONS. SUCH AS FOR FRAUD PREVENTION OR SECURITY CONFUSION AROUND FOR HAVING PROFITS FROM THE DISCLOSURE BY METRICS. AND IMPACT THAT HAS ON THE AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. AND OPERABILITY ISSUES OF THE CCPA INCLUDING QUESTIONS ON THE APPLICATION EXEMPTIONS WERE CONCERNED THIS BILL SIGNALS A RETURN TO PIECEMEAL APPROACH. TO DATA PRIVACY RIGHTS EXISTED PRE TWENTY EIGHTEEN UNDERMINE THE PURPOSE AND AFFECTS ABOUT LAW. SO I'LL JUST AND MY COMMENTS WITH THIS AT SOME POINT I THINK WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES IF WE WANT TO CREATE A SYSTEM THAT IS MORE ABOUT LAYERING OBLIGATION UPON OBLIGATION. TO ENSURE MORE MORE IT'S A SUIT THAT IS ABOUT PROTECTING CONSUMER DATA AND A WORKABLE AND- THEREFORE MEANINGFUL MANNER FOR THESE REASONS RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MR OFTEN. I GET THE MOST THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN SENATORS DON'T OFTEN ON BEHALF OF TECHNO WE'RE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO S. B. ELEVEN EIGHTY NINE. I'LL JUST QUICKLY ALIGN MY COMMENTS- WITH THE CHAMBER. I WANT TO QUICKLY JUST EXPAND ON A COUPLE OF POINTS- FIRST AS NOTED STATES THAT HAVE ENACTED BIOMETRIC SPECIFIC LAWS LIKE THIS BILL ALL LACK A COMPARABLE STATUTE TO CBRE- AND AS NOTED ONLY ONE OF THOSE HAS. A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION ILLINOIS. SO WHEN WE SAY THAT THIS BILL WILL CREATE UNTENABLE LEGAL LIABILITY- FOR COMPANIES AND CAUSE THEM TO REDUCE PRODUCT OFFERINGS. IT'S NOT A HYPOTHETICAL- IT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED IN ILLINOIS- SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THERE'S BEEN OVER ELEVEN HUNDRED CLASS ACTION CASES IN ILLINOIS AGAINST TECH AND NON TECH COMPANIES ALIKE. OFTEN IN SMALLER IN STATE COMPANIES- THE NET EFFECT OF BOURBON ILLINOIS HAS BEEN TO CREATE A COTTAGE INDUSTRY OF CLASS. ACTION LAW FIRMS AND TO PREVENT COMPANIES AND CONSUMERS FROM DEVELOPING. OR ACCESSING PROCHAN SUMER PRO PRIVACY USES. BIOMETRIC DATA LIKE BUILDING SECURITY. USER AUTHENTICATION FRAUD PREVENTION IT'S OUR- COMPANY'S OF PULL PRODUCTS OR DON'T OFFER CERTAIN FEATURES TO ILLINOIS RESIDENTS- DEVICES THAT DISPENSE MEDICINE SAFELY USING BIOMETRICS. IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION MEASURES USED BY BANKS. AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND MARK. ADDITIONALLY RECENT AMENDMENTS INCLUDE A REQUIREMENT THAT IF A PERSON EXERCISE THE RIGHT SOME OF THIS BILL THE COMPANY HAS TO PROVIDE THE SAME LEVEL OF SERVICE OR QUALITY OF OCCURRED AND IN MANY INSTANCES- THIS ISN'T POSSIBLE- FOR EXAMPLE SERVICE THAT USES A BIOMETRIC SECURITY FEATURE THANK- CAN'T PROVIDE THE SAME LEVEL FRAUD PROTECTION IF SOMEONE OPTS OUT- FOR THESE THEIR BIOMETRICS BIOMETRIC SIR. AS NOTED IMMUTABLE- THEY OFFER THE GREATEST LEVEL OF SECURITY- AND SO WE CAN'T OFFER THE SAME LEVEL SECURITY IF YOU OPT OUT OF THAT THE USE OF THAT- SAID THAT THEN WOULD THEN BE GROUNDS FOR A LAWSUIT- FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE SB ELEVEN EIGHTY NINE LOOK ORWARD TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION. THANK YOU BRING HIM STRUGGLING. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. AS CHAIR MEMBERS FEELING GRIEVES WITH BY A COME CALIFORNIAN ON BEHALF OF OUR FIFTEEN HUNDRED.

THANK YOU MEASURE- I KNOW THAT WE HAVE PROBABLY HAVE A LOT OF COMMENTS- IN SOME IN KITCHEN ON THIS ISSUE JUST FROM A PROCEDURAL STANDPOINT THOUGH- WHEN WE WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS OF THE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT- BACK WHEN. I AND I THINK THAT DO NEXT- BECOME ACTIVATED IT WAS IT IN IN TWENTY ONE OR TWENTY TWO. HELLO IF YOU CAN. OF TOP YOUR HEAD. IF YOU KNOW THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY ONE WE'RE IN TWENTY TWO RIGHT. YEAH IN JANUARY OF TWENTY. WE STARTED THIS IS HERE AND WE WERE TWENTY TWO. EITHER WAY- I THINK MY POINT IS THAT- THIS IS RELATIVELY NEW AND STILL BEING ROLLED OUT I THINK MINOR STANDARD THERE ARE SOME EXCEPTIONS THAT ARE STILL BEING- TEASED OUT. BUT MY RECOLLECTION IS THAT ALL THE PARTIES WERE BROUGHT TO BEAR ON THIS ISSUE IN THERE WERE CONCESSIONS AND UNDERSTANDINGS MADE DURING THAT PROCESS IN MY ONLY CONCERN BY LEESON AT THE PROCEDURAL LEVEL IS IF WE WENT THROUGH THAT ENTIRE PROCESS. DODD WE HAVE TO REPRESENT INDIVIDUALS WHETHER THEY BE IN THE SPECIAL INTEREST FOR THE POLICY REALM THAT WHEN WE AGREED TO SOMETHING. THAT WERE NOT IMMEDIATELY GOING TO TAKE A SECOND THIRD AND FIFTH BITE AT THE APPLE- THAT THAT SUBSTANTIALLY MODIFIES THE PROTECTIONS THAT ARE ALREADY IN PLACE WITHIN IT. SO I GUESS YOU KNOW MAYBE IT'S A QUESTION TO YOU BUT I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED THAT WE WENT THROUGH THAT ENTIRE PROCESS IN MOUNTAINS WERE MOVED. TO ACHIEVE THAT BILL SUCCESS IN THE APPROVAL THAT WENT ALONG WITH THAT. THAT ARE WE RETIRE WE ARE RISK OF LOSING CREDIBILITY WITH PARTNERS AS WE MOVE LEGISLATION- BY BUILDING COALITIONS AND THEN ONCE WE GET IT WE TAKE THAT FIFTY BITE AT THE APPLE. VISIT SHERIFF HER. ALTHOUGH I AM HUNGRY I DON'T THINK WE'RE TAKING TOO MANY BITES OF THE APPLE I IN. D. ELEVEN EIGHTY NINE HAS AN ENCOMPASSING DEFINITION OF WHAT IS BIOMETRIC INFORMATION THE CPRE FOCUSED ON THE INTENT. YOU KNOW NOT THE CAPABILITY WE'RE NOT THE CAPABLE THEY WHAT WAS THE INTENT THAT THE BUSINESSES WERE DOING SO WE COME AT IT FROM A DIFFERENT ANGLE THE OTHER IS THIS IS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN HAVING BIOMETRIC INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM YOU AT THE AT THE- STORE TOPPED OUT YOU KNOW WE'RE SAYING YOU HAVE TO OPT IN. IN ORDER TO HAVE THIS VERY SENSITIVE INFORMATION ARE COLLECTED THE ILLINOIS' SITUATION WHERE PEOPLE FOCUS ON THE L. ONORE SITUATION YOU KNOW THERE'S A TIME MY DATE PASSED THAT BILL IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN- IT REALLY DIDN'T START COMING TO LIGHT IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WHEN BIG FIRMS WERE COLLECTING INFORMATION AND 90% I THINK THE STAFF REPORT. POINTED OUT OF THE- PRIVATE READ FACTIONS WERE OVER. EMPLOYEES ON THE ON THE SECURITY AT THE TIME TIMETABLES ARE TIME PUNCHING A TIME CARDS. THAT'S TAKEN CARE OF NOW I MEAN YOU DON'T GET TO WORK UNLESS YOU SIGNED OFF ON LETTING THEM USE THAT THAT- BIOMETRIC INFORMATION. TO THE LIMITED PURPOSE OF MAKING SURE IT'S YOU WHO'S WHO'S WORKING. THERE YOU KNOW IT'S ALSO BIOMETRIC INFORMATION AS I IN THIS INDICATED MY- OPENING IS. REALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO RETRACT EVERY ONCE IT'S OUT IN THE PUBLIC IT'S NOT WHAT THE PASSWORD OR PIN. PIN CODE FOR YOU YOU CAN A NEW SOUL SECURITY NUMBER YOU CAN DO STEP YOU CAN'T CHANGE YOUR FACE. NOT EASILY- THE BILL. YEAH THE- M. I THINK THAT'S A THAT'S MY ANSWER RESHOOT THE INTELLECTUAL ACROBATICS THAT WAS FUN- YEP BY I THINK MY THOUGHT MY FINAL POINT ON THAT SAME ISSUE IS THAT IT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE ARE SUBSTANTIAL PROTECTIONS THAT WERE PUT IN PLACE AND NUMBER OF US ACTUALLY YEARS BACK TO APPRECIATE HELLO THE EUROPEANS WERE PUTTING FOR THEIR PRIVACY. LAWS IN THEIR PRACTICES- AND THAT BILL OF COURSE- HAD SUBSTANTIAL- SIMILARITIES TO THE EUROPEAN SYSTEM I THINK- IN GENERAL BECAUSE YOU WERE THERE- ON THAT ON THAT TRIP AS WELL. SO I THINK WHEN WE DO WE MOVE. A BILL LIKE THAT. THE PRIVACY ACT AND WE GET APPROVAL IN BUYING ANYTHING AND COOPERATION IN CONCESSIONS THERE NEEDS TO BE A DEGREE OF RESPECT ASSOCIATED WITH THAT PROCESS. IN THAT INDIVIDUALS CANNOT COME IN IN THE END RELATIVE QUICK SUCCESSION INSTRUCTED HER ALTERING OR UNDERMINING IT OR TWEAKING IT IN WAYS THAT REALLY YOU KNOW KIND OF. UNDO THE GOODWILL THAT WAS DONE BEFORE AND I THINK WITH AT ALL JUST AND I'VE AND I RESPECT THE WORK THAT YOU DO OF COURSE. OPERATING ON THIS THIS MIGHT BE A BIT OF A BRIDGE TOO FAR YEAH I GUESS MISTER CHAIR. IT WELL C. P. R. A. FOCUSED ON INTENT IF THIS BILL PURELY FOCUSED ON INTENT. IT WOULD DO LITTLE TO GUARD AGAINST SORT OF THIS BLANKET COLLECTION AND DISCLOSURE OF BIOMETRIC INFORMATION THIS IS JUST FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT AND IT IT WILL YOU KNOW THE IDEA IS TO SUPPLEMENT THE CPR EIGHT NOT TO OVERTURN ANYTHING WITH THIS YOU KNOW. MINIMIZING THE PROVISIONS I'VE TAKEN AMENDMENTS ON TWENTY THREE MAY I KNOW D. N. A.'S INCLUDED STATE UC'S ARE OFF BECAUSE I'VE TAKEN THAT AMENDMENT OUT SOME TRYING TO NARROW THIS ONE IT'S- IN A MEANINGFUL WAY. ALL RIGHT NOW FOR THE COMETS OR QUESTIONS IS OUR MOTION. SO HERTZBERG MOVES THE BILL- SOLD- BEFORE YOU CLOSE- CENTER WHITE CASKET I THINK THAT THAT YOU YOU ACCEPTED THE AMENDMENTS CORRECT CORRECT ALL RIGHT THERE'S STILL I THINK SOME MORE WORK TO DO ON THE BILL- I THINK THAT WE NEED TO FURTHER DISCUSSION WITH RESPECT TO THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM.

BUT WE HAVE BEEN NOT YET A DONE ENOUGH TO ENSURE THE CALIFORNIANS WORKING WHO ARE TRYING TO BALANCE EVERYTHING NEEDS AND THE DEBTS THAT THEY ENABLED TO TAKE HOME A LIVING WAGE TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILY.

GOING DOWN UNFORTUNATELY HE'S UNFORTUNATELY THOSE WITH THE LEAST RESOURCES IN THE ABILITY TO STAY AFLOAT HAVE BEEN HIT THE SEVEN ACKNOWLEDGES BOTH OF THESE REALITIES BY FAMILY PROTECTING A LIVING WAGE FOR CALIFORNIA WORKERS TO BE CLEAR. THIS LEGISLATION DOES NOT ELIMINATE THE DEBT IT DOES NOT CONTAMINATE THE DEBT BUT BY REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF MONEY TAKEN DIRECTLY FROM OUR PAYCHECKS THE BILL WILL LIFT PEOPLE OUT OF THIS CYCLE OF DEBT AND ALLOW THEM TO REPAY. ON TERMS THAT THEY CAN MANAGE- THE BILL ENJOYS A BROAD ARRAY OF SUPPORT RANGING FROM THE CALIFORNIA DREAM ALLIANCE TO THE N.

THOMAS WINS HERE BREAK HI- ED CLOSURES THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTER CHAIR VICE CHAIR AND OF THE CAN. I'M DESIREE OR IF DIRECTOR OF THE CONSUMER JUST CLINIC I EAST BAKED LAW CENTER AND MATURE BERKELEY LAW. AS PART OF MY WORK I TRY LAST IMPACT SKILLS OF LAWYERING OR MAJORITY OF THE STUDENT OF THE OUTCOMES IN OUR CASES ARE POSITIVE AND RESULT IN THE STUDENTS LEARNING THE REAL IMPACT OF ADVOCACY THE PATH TO ACCOMPLISHING THIS CAN BE VERY STRESSFUL AND DIRE. MY ORANGE COUNTY COLLEAGUES AT PUBLIC LAWCENTER OF ASKING TO SHARE AN ANECDOTE THAT IS NOT VERY UNUSUAL. FOR DIRECT LEGAL SERVICE PROVIDERS IN CONSUMER LAW. A COUPLE WHO WILL CALL DAN AND JANE HAVE ONE SMALL TO. AND ON THE WAY. WHICH IN PROVIDE A CHILD CARE FOR THEIR TOP. THE FAMILY RELIES ON DAN'S GROSS INCOME OF FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. LIKE SO MANY FAMILIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE BETWEEN TAXES RENT UTILITIES FOOD AND TRANSPORTATION. THEY WERE EITHER BREAKING EVEN OR SLIGHTLY UNDER WATER EACH MONTH. ULTIMATELY THE PLAN WAS FOR THE CLIENTS TO FILE BANKRUPTCY BECAUSE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF DEBT THAT THEY HAD WAS TOO MUCH FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO PAY OFF. THEIR ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF CONSUMERS WHO EARN ABOUT THE CURRENT PROTECTIONS FOR WAGE GARNISHMENT. BUT WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY ANYTHING TO ACCREDITOR. SHORTLY BEFORE THE BANKRUPTCY CASES TO BE FILED THE JUDGMENT CREDITOR SCHEDULED A DOCTOR'S EXAM. A DEBTOR'S EXAM REQUIRES A JUDGMENT DEBTOR TO APPEAR AT COURT FOR A HEARING. WHERE THEY ARE ASKED TO ASK QUESTIONS TO IDENTIFY AND LOCATE ASSETS. UNSURPRISINGLY THESE HEARINGS HAPPEN ON WEEKDAYS DURING NORMAL COURT BUSINESS HOURS. A NORMAL WORK HOURS FOR MOST PEOPLE. FOR WHATEVER REASON THE CLIENTS DID NOT APPEAR FOR THE DEBTORS EXAM AND THE JUDGE ISSUED A BENCH WARRANT. THE CLIENTS CONTACTED LEGAL SERVICES IN A PANIC FEARFUL THAT THEY WOULD BE ARRESTED. SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THEY HAD WERE WHO WOULD TAKE CARE OF THEIR CHILD IF THEY WERE SENT TO JAIL. HOW LONG WOULD THEY BE IN JAIL. COULD THE HUSBAND BE ARRESTED AT WORK. COULD ONE OF THEM VOLUNTEERED TO GO TO JAIL SO THE OTHER COULD STAY OUT TO CARE FOR THEIR CHILD. HOW WOULD THEY GET OUT OF JAIL IF THEY COULDN'T PAY. WELL OUR COLLEAGUES WERE ABLE TO EDUCATE THEM AND ULTIMATELY HELP THEM TO GET THE WARRANT RECALLED. ORDINARY PEOPLE LIKE THESE CLIENTS AND PARTICULARLY THE PREGNANT WIFE. SHOULD NEVER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT AN ARREST WARRANT BECAUSE OF A CREDIT CARD DEBT. INCLUDING SB FOURTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN PROVIDES THE MOST BASIC OF REASONABLE.

I WAS VERY VERY DIRECTLY INVOLVED WE HAD A LOT OF TESTIMONY IN HEARINGS OF ABOUT HOW THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM WAS WORKING AT THAT TIME RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PANDEMIC- AND THIS AGREEMENT- ABOUT HAVING A PILOT PROJECT. TO SUNSET IN JULY OF TWENTY THREE- AND- HAVING A WORKING GROUP THAT WOULD MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS AND COME BACK TO US- THAT WAS A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THE AGREEMENT I THINK THE- THE THIRD PART ABOUT WE- ARE PROVIDED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. IN ONGOING FUNDS- DIRECTING THE TRIAL COURTS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF OFFICIAL COURT REPORTERS IN FAMILY IN CIVIL COURTS AND YOU KNOW WE HAVEN'T. CONFIRMED A WHOLE LOT BUT IT APPEARS THAT THAT MONEY IS NOT BEING USED NOT BEING SPENT THE WAY FOR THE WRONG REASONS- THAT WE NEEDED THEM SO I WOULD REALLY ASK TO- AMEND THIS SO WE COULD- EXTEND THE IT WE CAN EXTEND IT RATHER THAN HAVING IT- ELIMINATING THE SUNSET. AND THEN JUST MAKE SURE WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IS BEANS USE THE WAY THAT WE DECIDED. TO USE IT- SO WITH THAT I THINK THE COMMENTS THANK YOU CENTER NUMBER.

IS A SEASON CHALLENGES AND SO I GUESS- I DO HOPE YOU'LL CONSIDER A NEW SUNSET FOR PERSONAL THE SUPPORTING IT- TODAY- AND I ALSO JUDGES SHOULD HAVE SUPER BROAD DISCRETION TO DISALLOW- TO DISALLOW REMOTE STATION- AND I KNOW THERE ARE A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT STANDARDS IN HERE BUT WHEN I JUDGE COUNTER COUNTS- BUT I JUST TO THINK THAT JUDGES ARE REALLY BROAD ABILITY- TO- TO REQUIRE. SUSPICION IN PERSON I DO LIKE HAVING THE FLEXIBILITY- AND AUTHORIZING CONTINUE FLEXIBILITY- BUT I COULD TO SEE- I COULD I COULD SEE SOME PROBLEMS ARISE IN THE LONG RUN I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN COMMENT ON. THAT SURE- IN MY CLOTHES OR WHATEVER YOU'D LIKE ALL RIGHT IF YOU COULD DO IT IN YOUR CLOSE AT ALL RIGHT. WELL I THINK- AND I DO I DO WANNA AGREE WITH THEM. TESTIMONY IN TERMS OF MULLIN I'M NOT SURE YOU CAN ELIMINATE A SUNSET ON SOMETHING THAT'S NOT CURRENTLY IN LAW- BUT I DO THINK- OKAY PASSING MAKING IT. TAKING IT FROM AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO OUR EMERGENCY ORDER TO- BEING APPROPRIATE TO BE USED IS TO GRIEVE WITH US SENATOR WIENER ABOUT- GIVING DISCRETION TO JUDGES I DID PRACTICE LIKE I PRACTICED CRIMINAL DEFENSE WORK FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND- I HAD MONOLINGUAL SPANISH SPEAKING SO WE HAD AN INTERPRETER AND WE HAD MULTIPLE INTERPRETERS DEPENDING ON HOW MANY- HOW MANY VICTIMS AND HOW MANY- DEFENDANTS THERE WERE AND THE THOUGHT OF TRYING TO DO THAT REMOTELY JUST. CHILLS ME TO THE BONE I WOULD WANT A JUDGE TO SAY NO WE UP WE ALL HAVE TO BE. PRESENT IN THE COURTROOM IN ORDER FOR THIS TO THIS KIND OF A CASE TO BE APPROPRIATELY RECORDED AND DOCUMENTED SO I WOULD LIKE THE JUDGES TO HAVE SOME DISCRETION SO IF YOU COULD IF YOU COULD ADDRESS ALL OF THOSE- WE- DO HAVE A MOTION. WE NEED A MOTION MOTION IT WILL BE TO PASS- BUT WILL TAKE YOUR GEAR IN HER STATEMENT IN THE CONSIDER HM. RIGHT SO IT UP. AS I GO AROUND THE HORN HERE- I'M PROBABLY FORGOTTEN SOME OF THE QUESTIONS BUT AS TO THE QUESTION CONCERNING DISCRETION JUDGES HAVE ISCRETION THE AL MAKE IT EVEN CLEARER IN THE BILL BUT I BELIEVE IT IS CLEAR IN THE BILL BUT- TO. AVOID ANY DOUBT JUDGES HAVE DISCRETION TO BE ABLE TO REQUIRE WITNESSES TO BE PRESENT FOR EXAMPLE- IT IN TERMS OF. THE VERBATIM RECORD- AS WAS MENTIONED I THINK THERE'S BEEN THIS IS NOT STILL A BEGINNING OF AN EXPERIMENT WE'VE BEEN USING REMOTE ACCESS NOW. SINCE I BELIEVE THE BEGINNING OF TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY ONE- THE BILL IS IN LAW WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT AMENDING A BILL IT'S NOT BECOME EFFECTIVE THE BILL AS OF JANUARY ONE OF TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY TWO BECAME BECAME THE LAW. OF THE SIMPLY SONS THE BILL IS THAT EXIST TODAY SUNSETS AND IN MID. TWENTY TWENTY THREE WHICH CREATES THIS. WEIRD SITUATION WHERE IF THE BILL SUNSETS IN MID TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AND WE DON'T ACT THIS YEAR AND WE ACT NEXT YEAR THERE'S A SIX MONTH PERIOD WHERE WE GO BACK TO WHERE WE WERE IN TWENTY. TWENTY OR TWENTY NINETEEN- THERE HAVE BEEN IS WAS TESTIFIED TO OVER A MILLION DIFFERENT- SETTINGS UP NO DOUBT THAT THERE'S EXCEPTIONS- I'M- SOMEBODY WHO ACTUALLY TRIED A JURY TRIAL- MID COVE IT LASTS ABOUT TWO AND HALF MONTHS AND WE USE REMOTE ACCESS IN MANY DIFFERENT FORMS. BOB IT'S NOT IT'S NOT PERFECT BUT IT'S MUCH BETTER THAN THE ALTERNATIVE WHICH IS NOT HAVING A TRIAL. AND IT IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE ALTERNATIVE FOR THOSE WHO ARE INDIGENT BECAUSE REMOTE ACCESS PROVIDES FOR EXAMPLE FOR STATUS CONFERENCES. FOR IT CERTAINLY MINISTERIAL MATTERS THAT THEY CAN ACCESS THE COURT WITHOUT MISSING A DAY OF WORK THEY CAN ACCESS THE COURT FROM SOMEWHERE NEAR WHERE THEY LIVE GO TO LEGAL AID OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT- AS OPPOSED TO HAVING COME TO COURT BUT IF THEY WANT TO COME TO COURT. THIS DOES NOT PREVENT THEM FROM COMING TO COURT- THE- CHALLENGE THAT WE- IS A CHALLENGE CONCERNING PROVIDING COURT REPORTERS. IN COURT ROOMS. TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO. ALL LITIGANTS TO HAVE AN OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER PRESENT AND ICOMPLETELY ASSOCIATE MY COMMENTS WITH SENATOR ALSO WHEN SHE SAYS WHERE DID THAT THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS GO I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS HAS GONE BUT WE CERTAINLY SHOULD FIND. OUT AND WE CERTAINLY SHOULD AS A MATTER OF PUBLIC POLICY DO OUR BEST TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE COURT REPORTERS AVAILABLE- RIGHT NOW THERE'S A TREMENDOUS SHORTAGE OF COURT REPORTERS WHICH IS STYMIEING. AND IN FACT PROVIDES BASICALLY IT PROVIDES AN ADVANTAGE TO THOSE LITIGANTS THAT CAN'T AFFORD A REPORTER THEY CAN BE OUT. THEY CAN BE QUITE EXPENSIVE. I AGAIN ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH THE MISS CASTRO IN HER COMMENTS. ABOUT TOM HOW WE HAVE- WE HAVE AN DURRETT. BUT WE'VE BEEN DOOR IN A SITUATION WHICH SORT OF CATCH AS CATCH CAN CONCERNING COURT REPORTERS IN TERMS OF AN AGREEMENT THE AYE I WASN'T PARTY TO ANY AGREEMENT AS TO AT THE SUNSET. SO I'M I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY HOW THAT INVOLVED. BUT I AM AMENABLE TO CONSIDERING- AND ADDITIONAL SUNSET. BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T STYMIE THE COURTS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO EVERYONE AND REMOTE ACCESS IS A TREMENDOUS TREMENDOUS EXPEDITE- AND ALSO COST SAVER AND IT DOES NOT IMPACT THE QUALITY OF JUSTICE SO ORIGINAL VOTE.
