PRIORITIES- SINCE I WAS ELECTED

EASY- COMMITTEE TO A- DOING THAT

IN FAITH AND I KNOW THE AUTHOR

01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:38.500
IS. WELL R. THREE CRY TO WITH

01:10:38.567 --> 01:10:42.104
UPON OUR ONE LIMIT TO- THE

01:10:42.171 --> 01:10:45.774
AREAS- LIMIT LIMIT-

01:10:45.841 --> 01:10:49.044
CONSIDERATION OF A GOLF COURSES

01:10:49.111 --> 01:10:52.114
TO AREAS THAT EXCEED A CERTAIN

01:10:52.181 --> 01:10:54.016
POPULATION DENSITY. WE HAVE TO

01:10:54.083 --> 01:10:56.151
DETERMINE WHAT THAT DENSITY WILL

01:10:56.218 --> 01:11:00.589
BE. WE WOULD ALSO LIMIT THIS TO

01:11:00.656 --> 01:11:02.625
GOLF COURSES THAT ARE UNDER

01:11:02.691 --> 01:11:04.893
UTILIZED OR UNDER USED AND AGAIN

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:06.762
THAT'S A TERM OF ART WE WILL

01:11:06.829 --> 01:11:08.831
HAVE TO DETERMINE. WHAT THAT

01:11:08.897 --> 01:11:12.501
MEANS- AND FINALLY- WE WOULD

01:11:12.568 --> 01:11:14.103
LIMIT IT TO AREAS THAT ARE

01:11:14.169 --> 01:11:19.108
CONSIDERED- A PARK POOR- AND

01:11:19.174 --> 01:11:20.876
EXACTLY WHAT THAT MEANS AGAIN IS

01:11:20.943 --> 01:11:22.678
SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO WORK

01:11:22.745 --> 01:11:25.114
OUT. I DO HOPE THAT WE'LL BE

01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:28.250
ABLE TO- A WORK THESE CRITERIA

01:11:28.317 --> 01:11:30.452
OUT AND THE METRICS ALONG WITH

01:11:30.519 --> 01:11:36.759
THEM AND- I- EXPECTED TO. WE

01:11:36.825 --> 01:11:38.093
WILL HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO DO

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:39.795
THAT BEFORE THE SUSPENSE HEARING

01:11:39.862 --> 01:11:41.964
AND I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT

01:11:42.031 --> 01:11:43.165

OUT- THOSE CRITERIA THAT YOU

01:11:46.869 --> 01:11:50.039
WILL PARK THE BILL- IF AND WHEN

01:11:50.105 --> 01:11:52.508
WE DO WORK OUT THE CRITERIA THE

01:11:52.574 --> 01:11:54.243
AMENDMENTS WOULD BE TAKEN IN THE

01:11:54.309 --> 01:11:56.512
NEXT COMMITTEE THE AMENDMENTS IT

01:11:56.578 --> 01:12:01.350
AGREED TO AN- THE AUTHOR IS

01:12:01.417 --> 01:12:04.353
WRITING. A I WANT TO SAY THAT.

01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:08.057
HOUSING IS A- A CRITICAL NEED IN

01:12:08.123 --> 01:12:10.893
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND- MY

01:12:10.959 --> 01:12:12.761
THINKING ON THIS IS THAT IF WE

01:12:12.828 --> 01:12:14.863
HAVE GOLF COURSES THERE MAY BE

01:12:14.930 --> 01:12:17.466
NONE. IF WE HAVE GOLF COURSES

01:12:17.533 --> 01:12:20.736
THAT ARE BEING UNDER UTILIZED-

01:12:20.803 --> 01:12:22.838
HOWEVER WE END UP THE FINDING

01:12:22.905 --> 01:12:26.475
THAT- THEN PERHAPS THERE IS A

01:12:26.542 --> 01:12:28.210
BETTER AND GREATER PURPOSE THAT

01:12:28.277 --> 01:12:32.781
WE CAN PUT THAT LAND- I. IT'S

01:12:32.848 --> 01:12:35.984
NOT THAT I WANT GOLF COURSES TO

01:12:36.051 --> 01:12:38.253
BE UNDER UTILIZED BUT IF THEY

01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:40.656
ARE THEN I THINK WE SHOULD

01:12:40.723 --> 01:12:42.591
CONSIDER THEM- AFTER THIS YEAR'S

01:12:42.658 --> 01:12:44.126
THE L. A. TIMES RAN AN EDITORIAL

01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:46.395
AS YOU THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE

01:12:46.462 --> 01:12:48.297
INTERESTED IN THIS ISSUE

01:12:48.363 --> 01:12:50.032
PROBABLY NO. URGING US TO THINK

01:12:50.099 --> 01:12:52.334
CREATIVELY ABOUT A CREATIVE

01:12:52.401 --> 01:12:56.839
BILL- THIS IS- THE AUTHORS AT

01:12:56.905 --> 01:13:01.577
ATTEMPT TO FIND A WAY TO.

01:13:01.643 --> 01:13:04.179
PROVIDE FOR MORE HOUSING AND TO

01:13:04.246 --> 01:13:07.116
THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN HONOR-

01:13:07.182 --> 01:13:09.084
THAT DIRECTION I THINK WE SHOULD

01:13:09.151 --> 01:13:11.420
AND- AND NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

01:13:11.487 --> 01:13:13.856
IMPACT ON THE GOLFING PUBLIC.

01:13:13.922 --> 01:13:14.990
THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK WE

01:13:15.057 --> 01:13:18.427
SHOULD DO. ANY OTHER COMMENTS

01:13:18.494 --> 01:13:20.395
FROM THE COMMITTEE I'M SURE YES

01:13:20.462 --> 01:13:22.598

01:13:46.054 --> 01:13:48.023
HAS NOT BEEN REPURPOSED AND SO

01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:49.358

WHAT WE DID WAS WE EXAMINE THE

01:35:25.019 --> 01:35:25.853
NEED ACROSS THE STATE WE LOOKED

01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:27.721

SHORTAGES ACROSS THE STATE- BUT

01:36:07.661 --> 01:36:09.296

WE ALSO BUILT AN INTERACTIVE

01:36:37.858 --> 01:36:39.660

01:37:04.752 --> 01:37:06.453
SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN CALIFORNIA.

01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:07.221
THAT WE'RE EXPLORING VARIOUS

01:37:07.288 --> 01:37:09.957
STAGES OF FEASIBILITY- WE

01:37:10.024 --> 01:37:11.325
RECENTLY PUT OUT A CALL FOR

01:37:11.392 --> 01:37:12.293

ISSUE TO ALL OF CALIFORNIA

01:37:13.727 --> 01:37:14.595
SCHOOL DISTRICTS WE THOUGHT WE

01:37:14.662 --> 01:37:17.498
MIGHT GET. EIGHT OR TEN OR

01:37:17.565 --> 01:37:19.266
TWELVE RESPONSES WE GOT FIFTY-

01:37:19.333 --> 01:37:20.634
WE MAP THE LAND WELL WHAT'S

01:37:20.701 --> 01:37:21.569
INTERESTING WITH CALIFORNIA

01:37:21.635 --> 01:37:22.770
SCHOOL DISTRICTS IS THAT THEY

01:37:22.836 --> 01:37:25.873
ALREADY OWNED LAND. RIGHT A LOT

01:37:25.940 --> 01:37:27.274
OF IT'S BEING USED BUT SOME OF

01:37:27.341 --> 01:37:28.742
IT COULD BE THE REPURPOSE FOR

01:37:28.809 --> 01:37:31.145
SHIFTED AROUND. OR IT'S ARGUABLY

01:37:31.212 --> 01:37:33.981
UNDER UTILIZED. THERE ARE ELEVEN

01:37:34.048 --> 01:37:35.849
THOUSAND PROPERTIES ACROSS STATE

01:37:35.916 --> 01:37:37.017
ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND

01:37:37.084 --> 01:37:38.719
ACRES. SO THERE'S LOTS OF

01:37:38.786 --> 01:37:39.620
INTEREST AND LOTS OF OPPORTUNITY

01:37:39.687 --> 01:37:41.755
ON THIS LAND IN EVERY COUNTY AND

01:37:41.822 --> 01:37:44.725
IT'S NOT JUST A COASTAL ISSUE.

01:37:44.792 --> 01:37:46.460
WE FOUND IT IN THE RURAL AREAS

01:37:46.527 --> 01:37:47.728
AS WELL WHICH WAS ACTUALLY

01:37:47.795 --> 01:37:48.729
SURPRISING TO MYSELF AS A

01:37:48.796 --> 01:37:50.231
RESEARCHER I'M MORE SO THAN I

01:37:50.297 --> 01:37:52.066
THOUGHT IT WAS BUT THE ISSUE IS

01:37:52.132 --> 01:37:54.101
A AS A FAMILY MEMBER SAID IT'S

01:37:54.168 --> 01:37:55.469
REALLY COMPLICATED. AND AB TWO

01:37:55.536 --> 01:37:56.270
TWO NINE FIVE HELPS TO LEAVE

01:37:56.337 --> 01:37:58.172
SOME OF THIS COMPLEXITY- WE CAN

01:37:58.239 --> 01:38:01.075
GET INTO SOME OF THOSE DETAILS-

01:38:01.141 --> 01:38:02.276
BUT IT PROVIDES ASSURANCES TO

01:38:02.343 --> 01:38:03.811
THE DISTRICTS ABOUT WHAT THEY

01:38:03.877 --> 01:38:05.779
CAN'T BUILD BUT ALSO. ENSURES

PROJECTS IT HERE TO LOCAL

01:38:10.551 --> 01:38:11.885
OBJECTIVE DESIGN AND DENSITY

01:38:11.952 --> 01:38:13.020
STANDARDS WHICH REALLY COMES

01:38:13.087 --> 01:38:14.455
RIGHT OUT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS

01:38:14.521 --> 01:38:16.423
THAT WE PUT FORTH SO. I SEE A

01:38:16.490 --> 01:38:18.826
LOT OF WIN WINS HERE AS YOU

THEY'LL BE NO REZONING- WHICH

A LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCY- AND

01:41:34.922 --> 01:41:35.989
WE ALSO JUST BELIEVE THERE'S AN

01:41:36.056 --> 01:41:37.057
INCONSISTENCY IN THE CURRENT

01:41:37.124 --> 01:41:41.228

01:41:45.632 --> 01:41:46.900
ALLOWABLE USE BUT THEN RIGHT

01:41:46.967 --> 01:41:49.369
BELOW THAT. IT SAYS IF YOU

SHALL BE DEEMED CONSISTENT. IS

01:41:54.708 --> 01:41:56.643
IT DEEP IN ALLOWABLE USE OR

01:41:56.710 --> 01:41:58.078
DEEMED CONSISTENT THERE'S SOME

01:41:58.145 --> 01:41:59.580
INCONSISTENCY IN THAT LANGUAGE

01:41:59.646 --> 01:42:00.848
THAT WE SAW COMING OUT OF

01:42:00.914 --> 01:42:02.115
HOUSING COMMITTEE. SO AGAIN I

01:42:02.182 --> 01:42:04.351

JUST REITERATE. WITH THIS IS A

01:42:06.153 --> 01:42:07.888
GOOD IDEA WE HAVE OUR OWN

WE UNDERSTAND THIS IS AN ISSUE.

01:42:16.163 --> 01:42:18.165
WHEN YOU DO THIS TYPE OF

01:42:18.232 --> 01:42:20.100
STREAMLINING- IT TAKES AWAY THE

01:42:20.167 --> 01:42:21.235
OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO MAKE OUR

IN STATE LAW I WILL JUST SAY ONE

02:19:29.794 --> 02:19:31.062
OF THE CITIES THAT I WORK

02:19:31.129 --> 02:19:33.832
CLOSELY WITH THE STATE SAYS THAT

HAPPEN BUT IN A DETACHED GARAGE-

02:19:43.041 --> 02:19:45.710

02:19:59.958 --> 02:20:02.127
