MASS. THEY'VE BEEN THERE FOR

00:33:37.014 --> 00:33:38.683
SEVERAL YEARS AND THEY ALSO

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:42.920
HAVE A- ANOTHER OF YARD IN IN

00:33:42.987 --> 00:33:44.422
IN THE EASTERN UNITED STATES

00:33:44.489 --> 00:33:47.725
AND THEY HAVE ANOTHER YARD. IN

00:33:47.792 --> 00:33:49.527
ASIA. AND THEY'VE ALWAYS FOUND

00:33:49.594 --> 00:33:52.663
THAT THE- THE SAN DIEGO

00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:55.900
LOCATION OUTPERFORMS. EVERY

00:33:55.967 --> 00:33:59.637
OTHER SHIP YARD THEY HAVE LOWER

00:33:59.704 --> 00:34:01.572
LIABILITIES THEY HAVE HIGHER

00:34:01.639 --> 00:34:03.875
PRODUCTIVITY AND SO THEY CAN

00:34:03.941 --> 00:34:05.276
COMMISSION TO STUDY TO FIND OUT

00:34:05.343 --> 00:34:07.912
WHY THAT THE LOCATION WAS MORE

00:34:07.979 --> 00:34:09.514
PRODUCTIVE AND THEIR CONCLUSION

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:10.948
WAS THAT THEY HAD A MORE

00:34:11.015 --> 00:34:13.351
DIVERSE WORKFORCE. AND BECAUSE

00:34:13.418 --> 00:34:16.521

00:34:16.587 --> 00:34:20.324
A- THE DIVERSITY OF IDEAS THAT

00:34:20.391 --> 00:34:22.593
LEAD TO BETTER PROBLEM SOLVING.

00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:24.262
AND I THINK THAT IS THE

00:34:24.328 --> 00:34:26.664
CALIFORNIA SUCCESS STORY WHY

00:34:26.731 --> 00:34:28.633
CALIFORNIA HAS SO MUCH SUCCESS

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:31.502
AND WHY IT HASN'T TRICKLED UP

00:34:31.569 --> 00:34:33.471
TO THE LEADERSHIP POSITIONS I

00:34:33.538 --> 00:34:36.607
THINK HAS. REQUIRES SOME

00:34:36.674 --> 00:34:40.344
INVOLVEMENT TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

00:34:40.411 --> 00:34:43.781

BY THAT STATEMENT YOU MET. THECALIFORNIA. LATINO COMMUNITY

00:35:40.605 --> 00:35:43.541
THERE MAY BE. A LANGUAGE AND

ARE YOU WERE YOU SEND THAT.

00:35:56.554 --> 00:35:58.489
LATINOS HAVE A CULTURAL DATE

00:35:58.556 --> 00:35:59.657
ARE NOT GETTING INTO THE

00:35:59.724 --> 00:36:02.093
UNIVERSITY SYSTEM BECAUSE OF A

00:36:02.159 --> 00:36:03.661
LANGUAGE A CULTURAL ISSUE. WHEN

00:36:03.728 --> 00:36:05.296
YOUGO ON TO SAY ASIANS ARE IN

00:36:05.363 --> 00:36:06.697
A FIELD FAIRLY DISTANT PUT

00:36:06.764 --> 00:36:08.232
DECENT POSITION IN MIDDLE OF

00:36:08.299 --> 00:36:09.634
MIDDLE LEVEL MANAGEMENT

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.502
POSITIONS ARE CORPORATIONS. FOR

00:36:11.569 --> 00:36:13.204
THE MOST PART THERE ARE THEY

00:36:13.271 --> 00:36:14.405
ARE NOT BREAKING INTO THE C.

00:36:14.472 --> 00:36:17.642
SUITES AND GETTING INTO BOARDS.

00:36:17.708 --> 00:36:19.243
SO IT'S A DIFFERENT. ISSUE

00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:20.745
RELATIONS AND BUT I JUST WANTED

00:36:20.811 --> 00:36:22.513
TO ASK YOU TO CLARIFY YOUR

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:23.114
COMMENTS OF WHAT YOU MEANT BY

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:27.351
THAT. I'M REFLECTING ON THE

00:36:27.418 --> 00:36:32.256
FACT THAT. OVER 20% OF BLACK

00:36:32.323 --> 00:36:34.525
AND LATINO YOUNG PEOPLE ARE

00:36:34.592 --> 00:36:37.595
GRADUATING WITH. THE ABILITY TO

00:36:37.662 --> 00:36:39.430
STEP INTO THESE POSITIONS WITH

00:36:39.497 --> 00:36:40.831
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

00:36:40.898 --> 00:36:43.434
BACKGROUNDS BUT IN TERMS OF THE

00:36:43.501 --> 00:36:45.369
REPRESENTATION WITHIN THESE

00:36:45.436 --> 00:36:48.839
COMPANIES IT'S WELL BELOW. THE

00:36:48.906 --> 00:36:50.975
NUMBERS WERE AVAILABLE SO IT'S

00:36:51.042 --> 00:36:53.644
MAKING THE ARGUMENT THAT THERE

00:36:53.711 --> 00:36:55.846
IS TALENT THERE TO DRAW FROM IT

00:36:55.913 --> 00:36:56.948
IS NOT BEING DRAWN TO I THINK

00:36:57.014 --> 00:36:57.882
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A BETTER

00:36:57.949 --> 00:36:59.584
STATEMENT TO SAY BECAUSE I

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:01.986
THAT'S I AGREE WITH TWENTY WHEN

00:37:02.053 --> 00:37:03.888

00:37:03.955 --> 00:37:07.458
PRODUCED AS A POOL 20% LEFT IN

00:37:07.525 --> 00:37:08.726
PLACE YET WE DON'T HAVE. NAY

ANYWHERE NEAR THAT NOT EVEN 10%

00:37:10.861 --> 00:37:13.564
ARM BARS NOT EVEN 5% ON BOARDS.

00:37:13.631 --> 00:37:14.865
I THINK THAT THAT IS A MUCH

00:37:14.932 --> 00:37:17.568
MORE COMPELLING FIGURE BECAUSE

00:37:17.635 --> 00:37:21.706
I HAVE TO SAY- OF. MAYBE

00:37:21.772 --> 00:37:22.974
GETTING IN TROUBLE. ACTUATED

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:25.509
FROM COLLEGE MAY NOT BE. A

00:37:25.576 --> 00:37:27.378
REQUIREMENT FOR BEING ON THE

00:37:27.445 --> 00:37:30.748
CORPORATE BOARD. AND FOR MANY

00:37:30.815 --> 00:37:32.483
OTHER WHITE PEOPLE IT HASN'T

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:33.751
BEEN A REQUIREMENT WAS A

00:37:33.818 --> 00:37:34.919
REQUIREMENT FOR MIKE MARK

A WHOLE LITANY OF PEOPLE THAT

00:37:44.595 --> 00:37:46.464
DIDN'T HAVE A COLLEGE EDUCATION

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:48.966
IS SERVED ON A- ON BOARD. BUT

00:37:49.033 --> 00:37:50.801
HAD BUSINESS ACT HUMAN AND

00:37:50.868 --> 00:37:52.103
RUNNING A CORPORATE GREAT

00:37:52.169 --> 00:37:53.771
CORPORATION REQUIRES SPECIAL

SKILLS BUSINESS ACUMEN AND

00:37:55.239 --> 00:37:56.741

ABOUT MAKING OUR BUSINESSES

00:38:06.784 --> 00:38:08.386
MORE COMPETITIVE AND IF THERE

00:38:08.452 --> 00:38:11.322
IS- CERTAIN ELEMENT HAPPENING

00:38:11.389 --> 00:38:13.257
AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL THAT IS.

00:38:13.324 --> 00:38:15.226
BE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT HOLDING

DIVERSE AS ONE PIECE OF

00:40:39.737 --> 00:40:41.605

THAT. ARE FOCUSED ON WOMEN

00:42:10.761 --> 00:42:13.397
BECAUSE IT LANDED IN A TIME OF

00:42:13.464 --> 00:42:15.432
ME TOO. BECAUSE THERE IS A

00:42:15.499 --> 00:42:18.369
CLEAR UNDERSTANDING THAT WHAT

00:42:18.435 --> 00:42:20.137
WAS HAPPENING IN SOCIETY WAS

00:42:20.204 --> 00:42:22.539
HITTING HARD- AT THE ISSUE OF

00:42:22.606 --> 00:42:26.610
WOMEN AND THEIR ABILITY TO HAVE

00:42:26.677 --> 00:42:27.211
A STRONG VOICE AND TO BE HEARD

IN THE RIVER ARE REPRESENTED- I

00:42:30.681 --> 00:42:31.382
THINK THAT THAT WAS

00:42:31.448 --> 00:42:34.018
APPROPRIATE. THIS BILL.

00:42:34.084 --> 00:42:37.521
EMERGENCE AT A TIME WHERE WE

00:42:37.588 --> 00:42:40.824
SEE RACIAL TENSION. AND DISCORD

00:42:40.891 --> 00:42:43.494
AND RACISM IT'S

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:45.129
INSTITUTIONALIZED. IN OUR

00:42:45.195 --> 00:42:50.200
COUNTRY. AND SO THIS BILL WAS

00:42:50.267 --> 00:42:52.369
DESIGNED TO ADDRESS AT THE

00:42:52.436 --> 00:42:54.305
WOMEN'S BILL ADDRESSED WOMEN'S

00:42:54.371 --> 00:42:57.541

WAS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS RACIAL

00:43:00.878 --> 00:43:02.279
ISSUES AS IT IMPACTS ON OUR-

00:43:02.346 --> 00:43:05.382
PERSPECTIVE I HAVE. SUSAN IT'S

00:43:05.449 --> 00:43:07.451
HARD TO BREATHE THE SLICK. HI

00:43:07.518 --> 00:43:10.354

DRESSING THE ISSUE GOING

00:43:21.365 --> 00:43:24.101
FORWARD- BUT I THINK THE TIME

00:43:24.168 --> 00:43:26.470
IS. SINGULARLY FOCUSED AT THIS

00:43:26.537 --> 00:43:29.773
MOMENT ON RACE IN AMERICA NOW

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:35.245
WE CAN GET OUR ARMS AROUND. IT

00:43:35.312 --> 00:43:37.548
CONCERNS ME IN IN THE

00:43:37.614 --> 00:43:39.616
DEFINITION OF UNDER REPRESENTED

THANK YOU FOR. BUT THAT I THINK

00:43:47.758 --> 00:43:49.226
THIS WOULD BE IMPROVED IF IT

00:43:52.162 --> 00:43:56.700

HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT I'VE

00:44:09.346 --> 00:44:11.382

WELL AND AS A PERSON WHO SPENT.

00:44:34.671 --> 00:44:35.472
TWENTY YEARS IN CORPORATE

00:44:35.539 --> 00:44:38.308
AMERICA I WAS ALWAYS AMAZED AT

00:44:38.375 --> 00:44:41.378
THE LACK OF DIVERSITY DESPITE.

00:44:41.445 --> 00:44:45.616
WARNING THAT DIVERSE CUSTOMERBASE TO BUY YOUR PRODUCT OR

THIS NATION EVEN HERE IN THIS

00:44:56.226 --> 00:44:58.228
BUILDING- THAT LOOKS LIKE A

00:44:58.295 --> 00:44:59.563
BLACK OFFICE A FEW YEARS AGO.

00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:02.699
HOSTED A HEARING AND WE INVITED

BROAD INVITATION. AND WE

00:45:12.476 --> 00:45:13.710
APPRECIATE THOSE TWO THAT

00:45:13.777 --> 00:45:16.180
SHOWED UP- BECAUSE IT SHOWED A

00:45:16.246 --> 00:45:19.516
COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY FOR FAR

00:45:19.583 --> 00:45:21.385
TOO LONG CORPORATIONS OF SIMPLY

00:45:21.452 --> 00:45:24.321
CHECK THE BOX. AS IT RELATES TO

00:45:24.388 --> 00:45:26.457
DIVERSITY AND I'M HAPPY TO HEAR

00:45:26.523 --> 00:45:29.359
THAT. H. P. STATED IT'S PART OF

00:45:29.426 --> 00:45:31.095
THEIR DNA AND IT HAS TO BE PART

00:45:31.161 --> 00:45:32.796
OF THEIR DNA IF IT'S REALLY

00:45:32.863 --> 00:45:36.934
GONNA WORK BECAUSE A I THINK

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.235
OUR DIVERSITY IS OUR STRENGTH

00:45:38.302 --> 00:45:40.904
NOT ONLY AS A- STATE BUT AS A

00:45:40.971 --> 00:45:43.073
NATION AND I WAS SOMEWHAT TAKEN.

00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:44.808
BY MR BISHOP'S COMMENTS THAT HE

00:45:44.875 --> 00:45:46.777
WAS FEARFUL THAT THIS WOULD

00:45:46.844 --> 00:45:48.846
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST MEN WELL

00:45:48.912 --> 00:45:49.446
MEN HAVE BEEN DISCRIMINATING

00:45:49.513 --> 00:45:53.217
AGAINST WOMEN FOR FOUR HUNDRED

00:45:53.283 --> 00:45:53.851
YEARS IN THIS COUNTRY SO I IT'S

00:45:53.917 --> 00:45:57.321
TIME TO. LEVEL THE PLAYING AND

00:45:57.387 --> 00:45:58.455
ALLOW FOLKS. I UNDERSTAND THE

00:45:58.522 --> 00:46:00.057
CONCERNS THAT A SENATOR

00:46:00.124 --> 00:46:02.059
PORTANTINO'S REYES BECAUSE

00:46:02.126 --> 00:46:03.360

00:46:03.427 --> 00:46:04.561
LEGISLATION WITH THE INSURANCE

00:46:04.628 --> 00:46:05.929
INDUSTRY AND WE'VE INCLUDED

00:46:05.996 --> 00:46:08.899
LGBT. AND MUCH OF WHAT WE'VE

00:46:08.966 --> 00:46:11.635
DONE HERE BUT- IT'S FAR EASIER

00:46:11.702 --> 00:46:13.470
TO IDENTIFY ONE'S RACE AND

00:46:13.537 --> 00:46:17.040
GENDER AND DISCRIMINATE AGAINST

00:46:17.107 --> 00:46:18.208
THAT VERSUS. THE ASSET RANGE.

00:46:18.275 --> 00:46:19.977
SO I UNDERSTAND THE GOAL THAT

00:46:20.043 --> 00:46:21.445
MR HOLDEN IS TRYING TO ACHIEVE

00:46:21.512 --> 00:46:23.113

ONE'S. SEXUAL ORIENTATION SO I

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:31.188
UNDERSTAND YOU'RE TRYING TO

00:46:31.255 --> 00:46:32.489
ACHIEVE HERE BUT WE HAVE

00:46:32.556 --> 00:46:36.527

EVERYTHING BUT I UNDERSTAND

00:46:52.976 --> 00:46:55.846
WHAT WE'RE DOING BECAUSE- FAR

00:46:55.913 --> 00:46:57.414
TOO OFTEN WE SEE FOLKS. BEING

00:46:57.481 --> 00:46:59.116
EXCLUDED SIMPLY BECAUSE OF

00:46:59.183 --> 00:47:01.118
THEIR CALLER. SIMPLY BECAUSE WE

00:47:01.185 --> 00:47:02.853
NEVER GET TO ANYTHING ELSE

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:04.721
SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THEIR GENDER

00:47:04.788 --> 00:47:06.690

01:35:57.785 --> 01:36:00.187
PREDATORY IN THIS IN THIS AREA

01:36:00.254 --> 01:36:01.188
TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T UNDERSTAND

01:36:01.255 --> 01:36:02.223
EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE GETTING

01:36:02.289 --> 01:36:03.891
INTO AND THESE ARE LONG TERM

01:36:03.958 --> 01:36:05.559
COMMITMENTS. AND THAT'S WHY

01:36:05.626 --> 01:36:07.061
WE'VE SEEN LOTS OF LEGISLATION

01:36:07.128 --> 01:36:10.064
WE HAVE IT IN OUR ANALYSIS HERE

01:36:10.131 --> 01:36:10.698
OF TRYING TO CLEAN UP THOSE BAD

01:36:10.764 --> 01:36:12.700
ACTORS BUT THERE THERE IS A LOT

01:36:12.766 --> 01:36:14.168

NEED TO TEACH AND ICE I THINK

01:36:24.812 --> 01:36:25.312

ONE OF THESE. WOULD DO THAT AND

01:36:29.984 --> 01:36:32.586
I DON'T THINK EITHER ONE OF

01:36:32.653 --> 01:36:33.187
THEM ACTUALLY DO THAT I THINK

01:36:33.254 --> 01:36:38.058
IT SAYS. UNDER A THAT. THAT

01:36:38.125 --> 01:36:38.926

01:37:11.592 --> 01:37:15.029
PROGRAM IS AN EXCELLENT WAY TO

01:37:15.095 --> 01:37:15.663
CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:37:15.729 --> 01:37:20.701
PEOPLE TO- UPGRADE. THE NOT

01:37:20.768 --> 01:37:22.236
ONLY THE WEATHER IS WEATHER IS

01:37:22.303 --> 01:37:27.474
ATION BUT THEIR KINDS OF IT.

01:37:27.541 --> 01:37:32.846
GOOD CLIMATE CHANGE TYPE OF- OF

01:37:32.913 --> 01:37:35.282
FEATURES WHETHER IT'S WATER

01:37:35.349 --> 01:37:37.284
REDUCTION OR WHETHER IT'S SOLAR

01:37:37.351 --> 01:37:40.287
ENERGY- MANY PEOPLE DON'T HAVE

01:37:40.354 --> 01:37:41.455
THE CASH UP FRONT AND THEY

01:37:41.522 --> 01:37:42.923
DON'T THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW

01:37:42.990 --> 01:37:44.191
TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS UNLESS

01:37:44.258 --> 01:37:45.593
UNLESS THERE'S A PEACE PROGRAM

01:37:45.659 --> 01:37:47.161
BUT THAT HAVING BEEN SAID. WHAT

01:37:47.228 --> 01:37:50.164
IS IT WHAT HAS EVOLVED OVER THE

01:37:50.231 --> 01:37:52.032
YEARS IS THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE

01:37:52.099 --> 01:37:54.101
THAT ARE WILLING TO TAKE

01:37:54.168 --> 01:37:57.738
ADVANTAGE. AND MAKE A SALE YEAH

01:37:57.805 --> 01:37:59.139
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE

01:37:59.206 --> 01:38:00.874
INDIVIDUAL UNDERSTANDS WHAT IT

01:38:00.941 --> 01:38:02.209
IS THEY'RE PURCHASING

01:38:02.276 --> 01:38:05.913
UNDERSTANDS THAT THE LOAN IS

01:38:05.980 --> 01:38:09.016
GOING TO END UP GOING ON THEIR

01:38:09.083 --> 01:38:11.652
ON THEIR HOME AND THAT IT IS

01:38:11.719 --> 01:38:13.654
SOON TO FIRST POSITION WHEN

01:38:13.721 --> 01:38:16.457
TAXES ARE PAID AND THAT IT'S

01:38:16.523 --> 01:38:19.193
GOING TO INCREASE THE COST AT

01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:20.361
THE TIME THAT THEY PAY THEIR

01:38:20.427 --> 01:38:22.129
TAXES AND THEY CAN'T JUST PAY

01:38:22.196 --> 01:38:24.465
ONE AND THE OTHER. IT GOES IN

01:38:24.531 --> 01:38:26.200
IN TO DEFY YOU PAY YOU DEFAULT

01:38:26.267 --> 01:38:27.735
ON YOUR TAXES AND ONCE THAT

01:38:27.801 --> 01:38:29.436
STARTS HAPPENING IT JUST STARTS

01:38:29.503 --> 01:38:32.573
THE SNOWBALL ROLLING AND SO- I

01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:33.907
I'M I'M GONNA TELL YOU TODAY

01:38:33.974 --> 01:38:37.478
THAT I SUPPORT ANYTHING IN

01:38:37.544 --> 01:38:38.545
WRITING BECAUSE I IT'S AN IF

01:38:38.612 --> 01:38:40.581
YOU'RE GONNA SELL ME PRODUCT

01:38:40.648 --> 01:38:42.082
IT'S GOING TO END UP ON MY

01:38:42.149 --> 01:38:43.517
TAXES AND THAT I'M GOING TO

01:38:43.584 --> 01:38:45.185
HAVE TO PAY. OR WHOEVER IT IS A

01:38:45.252 --> 01:38:47.988
BITES MY HOME- FOR YEARS TO

01:38:48.055 --> 01:38:49.757
COME. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CHANCE

01:38:49.823 --> 01:38:51.058
TO REVIEW THAT WITH SOMEBODY

01:38:51.125 --> 01:38:52.793
AND TAKING THE PAPER WORK IN

01:38:52.860 --> 01:38:54.028
AND SITTING DOWN AND HAVING A

01:38:54.094 --> 01:38:55.329
CONVERSATION ABOUT IT IT'S

01:38:55.396 --> 01:38:56.797
PROBABLY A REALLY GOOD THING

01:38:56.864 --> 01:38:58.098
AND THE IDEA THAT YOU WOULD

01:38:58.165 --> 01:38:59.333
ACTUALLY SELL IT TO SOMEONE

01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:01.001
WHO'S GOT A REVERSE MORTGAGE.

01:39:01.068 --> 01:39:02.603
IS TO ME AND CONSCIONABLE

01:39:02.670 --> 01:39:03.937
BECAUSE YOU'RE HERE YOU'VE

01:39:04.004 --> 01:39:06.106
TAKEN A REVERSE MORTGAGE. THAT

01:39:06.173 --> 01:39:07.741
WILL IGNORE TO THE DETRIMENT OF

01:39:07.808 --> 01:39:11.812
YOUR ERRORS. WHEN YOU PASS ON.

01:39:11.879 --> 01:39:15.616
THAT DIED- YOU YOU ARE YOU'RE

01:39:15.683 --> 01:39:16.984
TAKING MONEY OUT OF YOUR HOME

01:39:17.051 --> 01:39:18.752
IN ORDER TO SUPPORT YOURSELF.

01:39:18.819 --> 01:39:21.588
AND SO- THAT TO ADD TO THAT

01:39:21.655 --> 01:39:23.223
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO

01:39:23.290 --> 01:39:24.358
ME SO I WANT TO JUST SAY THAT I

01:39:24.425 --> 01:39:26.060
REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING

01:39:26.126 --> 01:39:28.796
THIS BILL FORWARD I UNDERSTAND-

01:39:28.862 --> 01:39:30.464
YOU KNOW IT'S A LOT EASIER TO

01:39:30.531 --> 01:39:32.700
DO THINGS- LIKE CHRONICALLY.

01:39:32.766 --> 01:39:33.934
I'M SORRY BUT I'M A HARD PAPER

01:39:34.001 --> 01:39:36.303
KIND OF PERSON I WONDER WHEN I

01:39:36.370 --> 01:39:37.538
READ SOMETHING ON A COMPUTER

01:39:37.604 --> 01:39:39.807
IT'S DIFFERENT THAN WHEN I READ

01:39:39.873 --> 01:39:41.775
IT IN WRITING. AND PEOPLE AND

01:39:41.842 --> 01:39:44.178
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY I THINK SO

01:39:44.244 --> 01:39:47.715
I'M I I'M I'M I BELIEVE THAT.

01:39:47.781 --> 01:39:53.620
IN A. HE SAID. AND IF AGREEABLE

01:39:53.687 --> 01:39:54.988
THERE WILL BE ELSE AT THAT'S

01:39:55.055 --> 01:39:55.589
THE DIRECTION I'D LIKE TO SEE

01:39:55.656 --> 01:39:56.523
IF ON ON THINK IT IS IT EASIER

01:39:56.590 --> 01:39:59.326
TO DO THINGS ELECTRON OPS. BUT

01:39:59.393 --> 01:40:01.829
I ALSO THINK THAT THERE. IF

01:40:01.895 --> 01:40:03.630
WITH THE EDUCATION THAT I HAVE

01:40:03.697 --> 01:40:05.566
I LIKE TO READ THINGS IN PAPER

01:40:05.632 --> 01:40:07.167
THEN I THINK THAT WE SHOULD

01:40:07.234 --> 01:40:09.670
EXTEND IT TO ANYBODY AND- PART

01:40:09.737 --> 01:40:11.739
OF THE CHALLENGE. IS THAT. IT

01:40:11.805 --> 01:40:13.407
MAY SAY YOU HAVE THE OPTION TO

01:40:13.474 --> 01:40:15.576
RECEIVE THIS ELECTRONICALLY OR

01:40:15.642 --> 01:40:17.411
NOT BUT THAT'S NOT TOLD PEOPLE.

01:40:17.478 --> 01:40:18.779
THAT WOULD THEIR TOLD HERE'S

01:40:18.846 --> 01:40:20.447

PLACE HERE IN TERMS OF HIS

01:40:37.398 --> 01:40:38.799
COMMITTEE MAYBE WE COULD GET TO

01:40:38.866 --> 01:40:40.267
A POINT THAT MAKES SENSE AND

01:40:40.334 --> 01:40:41.835
FIRST OF ALL I THINK THIS IS

01:40:41.902 --> 01:40:43.337

TAKING. AS THROUGH EMAIL. AND

HI I JUST THINK THAT. IT JUST

01:40:58.085 --> 01:41:00.154
MAKES SENSE SAVES A LOT OF

01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:02.990
MONEY AND PAPER AND- HASSLE TO

01:41:03.056 --> 01:41:10.431

01:41:10.497 --> 01:41:12.733
FOR THOSE PEOPLE. THAT TONE OF.

01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:14.368

ANYWAY TO REALLY PRINT THAT AND

01:41:19.406 --> 01:41:21.608
I KNOW THAT'S- THAT HAPPENS AS

01:41:21.675 --> 01:41:23.143
WELL. PER COPY I THINK IS

01:41:23.210 --> 01:41:25.779
APPROPRIATE I PUT AN AIR

01:41:25.846 --> 01:41:27.848
CONDITIONER IN MY HOUSE AND

01:41:27.915 --> 01:41:30.350
WASN'T AS MUCH AS A- OF THOSE

01:41:30.417 --> 01:41:32.853
IS ACTUALLY A SMALL CONTRACT

01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:33.720
BUT IF THEY GIVE ME CONTRAI

01:41:33.787 --> 01:41:36.190
DIDN'T REQUESTED BUT I SIGNED

01:41:36.256 --> 01:41:38.025
ONE THEY GAVE ME A COPY AND IT

01:41:38.091 --> 01:41:39.760
WAS A DIFFICULT IF THERE IS A

01:41:39.827 --> 01:41:42.129
CONTRACT. HE SHOULD BE. A

01:41:42.196 --> 01:41:43.630
CONTRACT THAT'S AVAILABLE TO

01:41:43.697 --> 01:41:45.799
REVIEW I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND

01:41:45.866 --> 01:41:50.571
WHY THAT IS. THE CHALLENGE BUT

01:41:50.637 --> 01:41:53.440
FIVE I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT.

01:41:53.507 --> 01:41:56.543
MAY BE YOU KNOW WHICH SITS I

01:41:56.610 --> 01:41:57.845
LIKE I LIKE A COMBINATION OF

01:41:57.911 --> 01:42:00.481
THE AMENDMENTS ONE THAT REPORT

01:42:00.547 --> 01:42:03.116
STATED THAT THE IN THE- THE

01:42:03.183 --> 01:42:04.451
PERSON IS INFORMED THAT

01:42:04.518 --> 01:42:06.720
EXISTING LAW REQUIRES. THAT A

01:42:06.787 --> 01:42:08.555
HARD COPY THE STOCK MAY BE

01:42:08.622 --> 01:42:10.390
PROVIDED TO BEFORE. ARE

01:42:10.457 --> 01:42:12.493
REVIEWING AND SIGNING ON AND

01:42:12.559 --> 01:42:14.628
THAT JUST SEEMS VERY REASONABLE

01:42:14.695 --> 01:42:16.196
TO ME THAT THAT COULD HAVE A

01:42:16.263 --> 01:42:20.267
COPY IN A CHANCE TO READ. WHAT

01:42:20.334 --> 01:42:22.402

IT TO YOU I DON'T KNOW. IT JUST

01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:29.343
SEEMS FAIR TO ME. BUT ALSO A

01:42:29.409 --> 01:42:31.078
PROVISION THAT ALLOWS YOU TO

01:42:31.144 --> 01:42:33.547
REQUEST. THAT IT BE SENT TO YOU

01:42:33.614 --> 01:42:35.916
BY EMAIL I THINK IS ALSO

01:42:35.983 --> 01:42:37.584
REASONABLE AND THAT SHOULD BE.

01:42:37.651 --> 01:42:41.054
AND SO THEN WHEN YOU ARE GIVEN

01:42:41.121 --> 01:42:42.823

01:42:53.967 --> 01:42:56.837
NECESSARILY STRICKEN I IT BUT-

IN THIS ENVIRONMENT COVE IT- IT

01:42:58.872 --> 01:43:00.841

HAS TO BE DONE YOU PROBABLY

01:43:07.548 --> 01:43:09.516
THROUGH THE MAIL. IN THIS

01:43:09.583 --> 01:43:11.952
ENVIRONMENT SOME PEOPLE

01:43:12.019 --> 01:43:12.586
CONSIGNED THINGS ELECTRONICALLY

01:43:12.653 --> 01:43:15.222
