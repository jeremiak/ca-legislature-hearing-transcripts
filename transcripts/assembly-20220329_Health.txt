RACISM IN OFFERING CULTURALLY CONGRUENT CARE YET IT REMAINS A PARTICULARLY UNDER USED RESOURCE WOMEN OF COLOR FOLKS WITH THE HIGHEST RISK OF POOR BIRTH OUTCOMES ARE MOST LIKELY TO REPORT WANTING BUT NOT HAVING ACCESS TO DO LIST SERVICES THIS IS IN LARGE PART DUE TO THE COST IN CALIFORNIA WHERE THE ECONOMIC STATUS OF BLACK WOMEN IS SUCH THAT WE MAKE ABOUT FIFTY NINE CENTS OF EVERY DOLLAR THAT A

COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL AND WORKING WITH MY TEAM WE'RE HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS OUR STATE HAS ROUGHLY TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE CURRENTLY INCARCERATED WE ALSO SPEND OVER FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS JUST IN STATE CORRECTIONS EXPENDITURES WE HAVE USED OVER THE YEARS INCARCERATION AS THE FIRST CHOICE AND LAST WAYS TO SOLVE MOST OF OUR SOCIAL PROBLEMS OVER TEN PERCENT OF PEOPLE IN CUSTODY HAVE AN OPEN MENTAL HEALTH CASE THERE'S AN URGENT NEED TO GIVE PEOPLE ACCESS TO RESOURCES ROOTED IN CARE AN OPPORTUNITY WE STILL SPEND OVER A HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PERSON DON'T CARCERI PEOPLE IN THE SYSTEM THAT EXACERBATES THE ROUTE CONDITIONS OF STRUGGLE POVERTY AND ADVERSE HEALTH CONDITIONS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE INCARCERATED HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER RATES OF MORE BILL IT MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY THAN TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC A RECENT STUDY FOUND THAT INCARCERATIONS STRONGLY CURRENT A CORRELATED WITH DEPRESSION AND HOSTILITY INCARCERATED PEOPLE ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY TO DEVELOP PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS ADDITIONAL PEOPLE INCARCERATED EXHIBIT HIGH BURDEN OF CHRONIC AND NON COMMUNICABLE DISEASES LIKE HYPERTENSION DIABETES ASTHMA AS WELL AS COMMUNICABLE DISEASES LIKE HEPATITIS HIV TUBERCULOSIS MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF INDIVIDUALS RELEASED FROM CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES NOTED THAT MOST HAD AT LEAST ONE PHYSICAL MENTAL OR SUBSTANCE USE ELEMENT NEARLY FORTY PERCENT OF MEN AND OVER FORTY NINE OVER SIXTY PERCENT OF WOMEN HAD CO ACCORDING OCCURRING DISORDERS FOLLOWING THEIR RELEASE THESE ARE JUST SOME EXAMPLES OF THE REAL EFFECTS THEY CAN BE BETTER ADDRESSED BY COMMUNITY HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS AND CARE BASED RESOURCES AND LOS ANGELES COUNTY OVER A DECADE OF THOUGHTFUL ORGANIZING LED TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS PUSHING THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO DEVELOP AND ALTERNATIVES TO INCARCERATION WORKGROUP ROOTED IN PUBLIC HEALTH AND CARE WAS CHAIRED BY DR BOB ROSS OF THE CALIFORNIA ENDOWMENT AND IT LED TO OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDING TO ESTABLISH AN OFFICE OF ALTERNATIVES TO INCARCERATION THE COUNTY LOS ANGELES COUNTY FOLLOWED SUIT ON THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS AND IS SUPPORTING THIS BILL ONE IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE THOSE IN THOSE HUNDRED FIFTEEN RECOMMENDATIONS WERE SOME JURISDICTIONAL CONCERNS AT THE COUNTY DID NOT HAVE THE FULL AUTHORITY TO REALLY BUILD OUT THE CONTINUUM OF CARE NEEDED FOR FOLKS THERE WAS A ROLE FOR THE STATE TO STEP IN AND RATHER THAN FORCE THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE STATE OUT RIGHT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT CALIFORNIA GO THROUGH THE SAME PROCESS OF OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE GONE THROUGH DEVELOP THOUGHTFUL SOLUTIONS CONVENE A TASK FORCE TO MOVE EXPEDITIOUSLY TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE MIGHT BETTER SERVE PEOPLE WITH THE CONTINUUM OF CARE THAT IS ONLY EXACERBATED BY CONDITIONS OF INCARCERATION JOINING ME TODAY IS MARK ANTONY CLAYTON JOHNSON IS THE FOUNDER OF THE FRONTLINE WELLNESS NETWORK IT'S AT THE

YEAH GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M REALLY HAPPY TO BE SPEAKING TO YOU TODAY ON THE ROLE THAT PUBLIC HEALTH PLEASE IN THIS IMPORTANT QUESTION ON SAFETY AND WELL BEING FOR OUR COMMUNITIES -- IT'S THE PERFECT TIME TO ACTUALLY HAVE THIS CONVERSATION AS THE PUBLIC HEALTH FIELD IS TAKEN A FIRM STANCE ON THE QUESTION IN TWENTY TWENTY THE AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION FORMALLY ADOPTED A POLICY POSITION THAT INCARCERATION IS IN FACT A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS I CAN BE REMEDIED WITH PREVENTATIVE MEASURES AND ALTERNATIVES THE FRONT MY WELLNESS NETWORK IN FACT WAS FOUNDED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IN RESPONSE TO A LOCAL EXPRESSION OF THAT CRISIS OUR COUNTY WAS MOVING FORWARD WITH A THREE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR MENTAL HEALTH JAIL PLAN IN A TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR WOMEN'S JAIL PLAN IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT SIXTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE WOMEN'S JAIL POPULATION I STRUGGLE WITH SOME FORM OF MENTAL DISABILITY OR TRAUMA WE WERE ABLE TO STOP THAT PLAN AS PART OF A MUCH BROADER COALITION BY PIPELINE PUBLIC HEALTH PRINCIPLES TO A VISION OF THE SOLUTION FOR US A BUILDING THAT SOLUTION UP MEN APPLYING THE PRINCIPLE TO CREATE SOLUTIONS WHERE PEOPLE LIVE WORK PLAY RATHER THAN RELYING ON THE PATIENT TO COME TO US -- THE LATTER IN THE CONTEXT OF HOUSING CRISIS JOB INSTABILITY IN A DIRT THE COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES HAS RESULTED IN A LOS ANGELES AND A CALIFORNIA WITH THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE ONLY FOUND ACCESS TO A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS ACCESS TO A CLINICIAN TO A JAIL TERM OR PRISON SENTENCE I WILL RECONSIDER THAT LAST YEAR WAS THE DEADLIEST YEAR IN ALMOST A DECADE FOR PEOPLE INCARCERATED IN OUR COUNTY JAILS I AM LOS ANGELES AND AS CLINICIANS CONTINUE TO TELL US THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PROVIDE OPTIMUM CARE IN THE JAILS THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE OF THESE HEALTH IMPACT OF THESE HEALTH OUTCOMES ARE PRETTY GRAVE AND ALARMING STUDY OUT OF VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN SHOWED US THAT FOR EVERY YEAR A PERSON IS INCARCERATED THEY LOSE TWO YEARS OF LIFE SPAN HOWEVER THIS IS WHERE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC HEALTH BECOMES A MANDATE THAT LIFESPAN CAN BE RECOVERED IF IN FACT PEOPLE GET OFF PROBATION IF THEY HAVE ACCESS TO HOUSING HEALTH CARE MEANINGFUL EMPLOYMENT AND IF WE AVOID JAIL INCARCERATION PERIOD SECONDLY A NATIONAL STUDY IN THE AMERICAN JOURNAL PUBLIC HEALTH FOUND THAT INCREASES INCREASED INCARCERATION RATES AND LOCAL COUNTIES WERE CORRELATED WITH MORTALITY RATES INCREASING IN THAT COUNTY BROADLY AND SO THE SPILLOVER EFFECT IS VERY REAL LAWCENTER COUNTIES YOU KNOW IS HOME TO THE LARGEST JAIL SYSTEM IN THE WORLD WITH THE LARGEST MENTAL HEALTH FACILITY IN THE COUNTRY -- YOU COULD IMAGINE OUR ALARM AS WE CONSIDER THE BROADER HEALTH IMPLICATIONS OF LIFESPAN ANXIETY DEPRESSION SUICIDALITY IN EARLY CHILDHOOD ADVERSE EXPERIENCES AS WE COMB THE DATA AND FOUND THAT BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN AND TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN BLACK WOMEN ALONE HEADED TOWARD ROUGHLY FIVE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE YEARS OF JAIL TIME IN THAT SIX YEAR PERIOD LET NEXT WOMEN SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OF JAIL TIME IN THAT SIX YEAR PERIOD THE TOP FIVE REASONS FOR THOSE ARRESTED INCLUDED A DRIVING ON A SUSPENDED LICENSE THEFT FAILURE TO APPEAR IN

MUCH APPRECIATE THE TIME AND ENERGY AND THE WORK THAT YOU'VE ALL PUT INTO THIS SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK AND DILIGENCE AND I DO LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH YOU TO ENSURE THE PROTECTIONS THAT WE'VE ALREADY DISCUSSED SO THANK YOU FOR THAT LAST YEAR I BROUGHT A SIMILAR BILL BEFORE THIS VERY COMMITTEE AB SEVEN FIFTY TWO THE BUILDING CHOI THE SUPPORT OF THIS COMMITTEE RECEIVING NO NO VOTES RESULTS IN AS MUCH AS TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN OUR COUNTRY IN AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE COSTS INCLUDING BOTH THE COST OF THE ABANDONED PRESCRIPTION ABANDONED PRESCRIPTIONS THEMSELVES AS WELL AS THE COSTS OF SUBSEQUENT CARE THAT COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED AB TWENTY THREE FIFTY FOUR OF IS A COMMON SENSE MEASURE WHICH SAVES PATIENTS THEIR TIME AND MONEY AND WILL BUILD BETTER TRUST BETWEEN PATIENTS AND MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS WHO PRESCRIBED THEIR MEDICATION CURRENT LAWS AND REGULATIONS DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT PATIENTS WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE FULL RANGE OF INFORMATION PERTAINING TO THEIR ACTUAL OUT OF POCKET COSTS AT THE PHARMACY COUNTER UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE PATIENTS FOR PATIENTS THAT ARE NOT ABLE TO KNOW WHAT THEIR MEDICATION COST WILL BE AND ARE LEFT WAITING UNTIL THEY REACH THE PHARMACY COUNTER RATHER THAN LEAVING PATIENTS IN A LURCH OR IN THE POSITION OF HAVING TO LEAVE THE PHARMACY WITHOUT THEIR MEDICATION THE PRICE ACT WILL ALLOW PATIENTS TO AVOID THIS EMBARRASSMENT AND SHAME OF NOT BEING ABLE TO AFFORD SOMETHING THEY ARE PRESCRIBED CAN YOU IMAGINE A SINGLE PARENT GOING UP TO PURCHASE GROCERIES AND FINDING THAT THE GROCERIES ARE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THEY ANTICIPATED AND HAVING TO PUT ALL THE ITEMS BACK ON THE SHELVES AND GO BACK HOME AND TELL THEIR CHILDREN THAT THEY DON'T HAVE FOOD FOR THAT NIGHT WITH THIS IS PRACTICALLY THE SAME SET SCENARIO AT THIS KIND OF PRACTICE WOULD BE UNTHINKABLE WHEN PURCHASING EVERY DAY IN THE SUBSIDIES FROM GROCERIES TO GASOLINE WHY SHOULD PURCHASING ARE NEEDED PRESCRIPTIONS BE ANY DIFFERENT THE PRICE ACT WILL ALLOW PATIENTS AND THERE FELT A CARE PRESCRIBERS THE ABILITY TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT RELEVANT COVERAGE COST AND UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT INFORMATION THE TECHNOLOGY DOES EXIST THAT YOU THIS GOAL WHY IS IT NOT BEING UTILIZED TO ITS FULLEST POTENTIAL HANGING IN THE BALANCE OUR CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION WITH ME IS LIZ HELMS AS MY WITNESS THANK YOU THANK YOU PLEASE GO AHEAD AND TO MEN THANK YOU SO MUCH I'M SO EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO BE IN PERSON IN THE ROOM AGAIN IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME CHAIRMAN WOULD HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LIZ HELMS AND THE PRESIDENT CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA CHRONIC CARE COALITION OR WE'VE CAUGHT FOUR SEASONS I GO FORWARD WE ARE PLEASED TO BE THE SPONSOR OF TWENTY THREE FIFTY TWO THE FOUR SEASONS A COALITION OF MORE THAN THIRTY LEADING STATEWIDE CONSUMER HEALTH ORGANIZATION SOME PROVIDER GROUPS THAT PROMOTE COLLABORATIVE WORK OF POLICYMAKERS INDUSTRY LEADERS HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND CONSUMERS TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIANS WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS AB TWENTY THREE FIFTY TWO ENABLES DECISION MAKING TO OCCUR WHERE IT SHOULD BE IN THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE BETWEEN A PATIENT AND THEIR PHYSICIAN WITH THE ENACTMENT OF THIS BILL PATIENTS WOULD BE CENTRAL ACTIVE STAKEHOLDERS IN THEIR OWN HEALTH AND WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO STICK TO THEIR TREATMENT PLAN THIS BILL IS CRITICAL AND TIMELY THE EASE UP TIME CONSUMING AND FRUSTRATING PROCESSES THAT WAY ON PATIENTS THEIR PROVIDERS AND WILL IMPROVE ACCESS TO ALL OF THE HEALTH CARE FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS AND DISEASES PATIENTS MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR HEALTH CARE BASED IN LARGE PART ON WHAT THEY CAN AFFORD OFTEN YUP YET OFTENTIMES THIS INFORMATION IS NOT AVAILABLE UNTIL THEY REACH THE PHARMACY COUNTER WHERE THEY MAY REALIZE THE TREATMENT IS UNAFFORDABLE AND MAY ABANDON THE MEDICATION ALTOGETHER WE HEAR ABOUT THIS ALL THE TIME DELAYS IN CARE NOT ONLY WORSEN THE PATIENTS STATE OF HEALTH BUT ALSO LEAD TO INCREASED UTILIZATION OF MORE COSTLY HEALTH CARE SERVICES THEREAFTER THIS IS A SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT WORK FOR THE PATIENT OR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WHO ARE THEIR OWN BURDENED WITH OUT OF -- AND ADDED ADMINISTRATIVE RESPONSIBILITIES AT A TIME WHEN FAMILIES CONTINUE TO FINANCIALLY STRUGGLE FROM THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC IT IS CRITICAL TO ADOPT PRACTICAL CHANGES THAT IMPROVE AFFORDABILITY BY FREEING UP EXISTING DRUG COST DATA FOR PATIENTS AT THE POINT OF CARE IN REAL TIME WHILE REDUCING THE STRAIN ON PHARMACISTS AND PHYSICIANS WHAT INTO THE COVER MY MEDS TWENTY TWENTY TWO MEDICATION ACCESS REPORT SEVENTY NINE PERCENT OF PATIENTS HAVE GONE TO PICK UP A PRESCRIPTION TO FIND OUT THAT IT COSTS MORE THAN EXPECTED IN THE SAME SURVEY EIGHTY SEVEN PERCENT OF PROVIDERS AND FIFTY SIX PERCENT OF PHARMACISTS SURVEYED SAID UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT NOTHING'S PROVIDE PREVENT PATIENTS FROM RECEIVING TREATMENTS THAT COULD HELP THE MOST AB TWENTY THREE FIFTY TO OFFER SOLUTIONS THAT WILL LEVERAGE EXISTING TECHNOLOGY TO STRENGTHEN PATIENT CENTERED CARE ENSURE DECISION MAKING HAPPENS IN THE MOST APPROPRIATE SETTING BETWEEN THE PROVIDER AND THE PATIENT REDUCE TEDIOUS ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS ON PROVIDERS INCREASE ADHERENCE TO A PROGRAMMATIC CATIONS AND IMPROVE QUALITY AND ACCESS FOR CALIFORNIANS WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS FOR THE MANY REASONS STATED WE STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ALLOWING THE FOUR SEAS TO EXPRESS OUR VIEWS TODAY AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR MADDEN THANK YOU TERM MEMBERS TO NINE REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA RHEUMATOLOGY ALLIANCE IN SPEAKING WITH RHEUMATOLOGISTS ON AB TWENTY THREE FIFTY TWO THEY PROVIDE ME WITH SOME INPUT AND EXAMPLES OUTLINING THE NEED FOR THE BILL IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR RHEUMATOLOGY PRACTICES TO BE WORKING WITH NUMEROUS INSURANCE COMPANIES WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN TOTALED TWENTY TO THIRTY DIFFERENT INSURANCE PRODUCTS ALL WITH DIFFERENT BENEFITS STRUCTURES COVERING DIFFERENT MEDICATIONS WITH UNIQUE COST REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PATIENT ONE SOLO RHEUMATOLOGY PRACTICE HAS FIVE STAFF DEDICATED TO JUST WORKING WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES AN EXAMPLE SHARED WITH ME IS OF A RHEUMATOLOGIST TREATING ADULT OR CHILD WITH SEVERE ARTHRITIS DUE TO THE SHORTAGE OF RHEUMATOLOGISTS GETTING INITIAL APPOINTMENT PRETTY PATIENTS CAN BE ANYWHERE FROM FOUR UP TO AS MUCH AS THREE MONTHS ONCE THE RHEUMATOLOGIST SEES THE PATIENT THEY WILL ORDER SOME TESTS TO UNDERSTAND THEIR CONDITION BEFORE MEDICATIONS ARE PRESCRIBED ONCE THE TEST RESULTS ARE BACK A SECOND APPOINTMENT IS NEEDED WHICH MAY TAKE AS MANY AS THIRTY DAYS AT WHICH TIME MEDICATIONS PRESCRIBED FOR THEIR ARTHRITIC CONDITION NOW NEITHER THE RHEUMATOLOGIST KNOW THE PATIENT MAY KNOW IF THE MEDICATION BEING PRESCRIBED IS COVERED AND EVEN IF IT IS COVERED HOW MUCH COSTS TO THE PATIENT WILL BE ANCHORED THE PATIENT ONLY FINDS OUT WHAT THEIR COST IS WHEN THEY GO TO THE PHARMACY IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR PATIENTS ONCE THEY LEARN THE COSTS TO OBTAIN TO NOT OBTAIN THE MEDICATION THIS THEN REQUIRES THE PATIENT TO SET ANOTHER APPOINTMENT WITH A DERMATOLOGIST FOR NEW PRESCRIPTION WHICH CAN TAKE ANOTHER MONTH THIS WHOLE PROCESS OF TRYING TO GET PATIENTS ON THE MEDICATIONS THAT ARE EFFECTIVE IN AFFORDABLE CAN TAKE MORE THAN THREE MONTHS ALL THE WHILE THE PATIENT IS SUFFERING FROM ARTHRITIC PAIN IF THE PAIN BECOMES SO BAD SOME PATIENTS WILL END UP IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT SEEKING TREATMENT A REAL TIME TOOL TO KNOW WHAT DRUGS ARE COVERED AND AT WHAT LEVEL WOULD BE A TREMENDOUS

PRESENT TO THIS BILL AB NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHT YOU MAY LOOK FAMILIAR WE HAD A A ROBUST CONVERSATION ON THIS BILL A YEAR AGO UNFORTUNATELY WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR AFTER A NEARLY UNANIMOUS SUPPORT IN THE LEGISLATURE I THINK THERE IS ONLY ONE NO VOTE AND THAT WAS UP I FOUND OUT A MISTAKE VOTE NOT LOOKING AT YOU OVER THERE A LOOK AT THIS THIS ISSUE AGAIN -- AND WE HAVE READ THE GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE AND LOOKED AT THE POTENTIAL ADJUSTMENTS TO THIS AND MADE SOME OF THIS IS ABOUT A CRISIS WE HAVE IN OUR STATE RELATE TO ADDICTION THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND PEOPLE REVOLVING THROUGH THE SYSTEM -- WE KNOW THE CURRENT SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK -- WE KNOW THAT A SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDER AS A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE AND SHOULD NOT BE TREATED IN A PUBLIC SAFETY SETTING IN IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM TOO OFTEN PEOPLE THAT ARE ADDICTS GET SENTENCE DOESN'T ADDICTS END UP COMING OUT OF JAIL AS AN ATTIC SO WE HAVE HERE IS THE INNOVATIVE IDEA A THREE YEAR PILOT PROGRAM WHICH WILL ALLOW THREE COUNTIES SANTA CLARA SAN JOAQUIN AND YELLOW TO OFFER A VOLUNTARY DRUG PROGRAM FOR INDIVIDUALS BEING SENTENCE FOR A DRUG RELATED CRIME JUDGES WILL BE OFFERED WILL BE ABLE TO OFFER INDIVIDUALS PARTICIPATION IN THIS PILOT PROGRAM BASED UPON THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE PROVIDERS AGAIN PARTICIPATION IS KEY BECAUSE THEY MUST VOLUNTARY LEE AGREED TO PARTICIPATE AND THEY CAN LEAVE AT ANY TIME WHICH OFF LOCUSTS ON NAY SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS TO THIS AGAIN THIS IS A PILOT PROGRAM MEANT TO PROVIDE ANOTHER OPTION OTHER THAN INCARCERATION JAILS AND PRISONS ARE OFTEN FAILING PEOPLE WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS THIS BILL PROVIDED EVIDENCE BASED RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT AFTER INDIVIDUALS COMPLETE THIS PROCESS IT WILL HAVE THEIR FELONY SEALED THE RECORD EXPUNGED AND THEY WILL BE ABLE TO SERVE LAST TIME IN THIS -- TREATMENT FACILITY AND THEY THEN THEY WOULD SERVE ANOTHER UNDERLYING SENTENCE HAD THEY WENT TO A COUNTY JAIL OR STATE PRISON WE ALL KNOW FAMILY MEMBERS OR LOVED ONES WHO ARE LOST TO THE STREETS ARE LOST TO ADDICTION AND ARE DESPERATELY LOOKING FOR HELP MANY TIMES I'VE SEEN PEOPLE GO AND GO THROUGH INTERVENTIONS PEOPLE SAY THAT THAT'S NOT VOLUNTARY YEAH WHEN YOUR FAMILY SHOWS UP AND SAYS HEY YOU NEED HELP THEY GO AND GET HELP THEY DIDN'T THEY DIDN'T VOLUNTEER THAT DAY BEFORE BUT THEIR FAMILY CAJOLE THEM TO SEEK HELP THIS IS THE SAME TYPE OF EFFORT HERE WE KNOW NEED LOOK AT THINGS DIFFERENTLY TOO OFTEN OUR OUR OUR HANDS ARE TIED WITH THEIR OPTIONS I KNOW THERE IS OPPOSITION AND CONCERNS BUT I'LL SAY THAT WHEN WE FIRST INTRODUCED THIS IDEA LAST JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE HAVE SINCE TAKEN OVER FIFTY CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS TO THAT WE'VE LISTENED TO THE PEOPLE OF CONCERNS TAKEN OVER FIFTY SUGGESTIONS AND AMENDMENTS -- WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO I KNOW THERE ARE SOME -- SUGGESTIONS HERE THAT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE ON BEHALF OF THE COMMITTEE AND SO YES FOR SURE I DO ACCEPT YOUR COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS I KNOW THERE ARE SOME OTHER IDEAS THROUGH THE OPPOSITION THAT OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED I'M WILLING TO DISCUSS WHAT WE'RE DOING RELATED TO THOSE ISSUES AS WELL AND WE NEED TO DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHETHER IT'S THIS LOOK THE LOOK THE AT THE ISSUE WITH CONSERVATORSHIP PEOPLE WITH IS ONE THING THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON AND -- AND STEP UP OUR GAME HERE IN CALIFORNIA WITH ME TODAY ARE ONE OF THE COUNTIES WHO WAS A SPONSOR OF THIS BILL AGAIN WE HAVE YOLO COUNTY WE HAVE SANTA CLARA COUNTY AND AND JOAQUIN COUNTY AS A THREE COUNTIES AND WITH ME TODAY IS THE YELLOW COUNTY DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY JONATHAN RAVEN THANK YOU SO HAVE TO TWO PEOPLE TEST RIGHT RIGHT THEY OKAY PLEASE WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THANK YOU A CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS JONATHAN RAVEN AND I'M THE CHIEF DEPUTY OF THE YELL COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND I OVERSEE ALL OUR MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION PROGRAMS AB NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHT PROPOSES A LOCAL TREATMENT ALTERNATIVE TO PRISON OR JAIL FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE CONVICTED OF FELONY CRIMES MOTIVATED MOTIVATED BY THEIR ADDICTION BUT WHO POSED TO MUCH RISK FOR A JUDGE TO RELEASE THEM OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY SO THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE FOR THE JUDGES A PRISON SENTENCE AND THEN SECURED RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT FACILITY WOULD NOT PREVENT THAT PERSON FROM WALKING AWAY AND POSSIBLY HURTING THEMSELVES OR OTHERS AB NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHT ENVISIONS CREATING A SECURE HOSPITAL LIKE TREATMENT FACILITY WITHOUT JAIL BARS AND GUARDS WITH GUNS IT INCENTIVIZE IS EJECTED FELONY OFFENDERS SENTENCED TO PRISON TO VOLUNTARILY CHOOSE THIS UNTRIED INNOVATIVE APPROACH AND WE CALL THIS PLACE HOPE CALIFORNIA FROM A PERSONAL STANDPOINT IN OVERSEEING ALL MEN ARE MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS IN COURT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM YOU'LL COUNTY I'VE SEEN COUNTLESS TIMES WHERE INDIVIDUALS WERE READY TO GO TO PRISON AND INSTEAD THEY CHOSE OUR MENTAL HEALTH COURT AND THEY GOT WELL AND THESE WERE SERIOUS OFFENDERS WITH VERY SUBSTANTIAL MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER ISSUES AN EXAMPLE IS A FORTY YEAR OLD WHO WAS CONVICTED OF FELONY COMMERCIAL BURGLARY HE'S ALSO IT ADDICTED TO HEROIN HE COMMITTED THE CRIME TO FEED HIS DRUG HABIT HE'S BEEN TO PRISON FOUR TIMES IN THREE YEARS AGO WAS CONVICTED OF ASSAULT CAUSING GREAT BODILY INJURY THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE SADLY HE'S NEVER GONE THE NECESSARY HELP TO GET WELL CALIFORNIA WOULD GIVE AN ALTERNATIVE JUST TO STATE PRISON AND SOME HOPE FOR THIS INDIVIDUAL HOPE CALIFORNIA FACILITIES WILL BE DESIGNED AND STAFFED BY TREATMENT PROVIDERS AND THEY WILL DECIDE WHO'S AN APPROPRIATE CANDIDATE AND THEY WILL DECIDE WHAT THE BEST TREATMENT PLAN WILL BE ANOTHER INCENTIVE FOR THOSE WHO CHOOSE AND SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE THE TREATMENT INSTEAD OF PRISON WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE THEIR CONVICTIONS EXPUNGED SO THEY WILL REGAIN THEIR DIGNITY AND WHEN RELEASED TREATMENT PROVIDERS WILL RECOMMEND A STEP DOWN WHICH COULD BE RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT FOR INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT TREATMENT OR ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE AB NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHT IS A VERY MEASURED PILOT BILL THAT ALLOWS THREE COUNTIES OFFER THIS VOLUNTARY TREATMENT ALTERNATIVE TO JAIL OR PRISON THIS EXACT TREATMENT MODEL HAS NEVER BEEN TRIED THE DATA WILL BE COLLECTED TO DETERMINE HOPE CALIFORNIA'S SUCCESS AND WE TALK ABOUT MEASURABLE RESULTS EVERY SINGLE PROGRAM THAT STARTS OFF AND HIS INNOVATIVE DOES NOT HAVE MEASURABLE RESULTS AND THEN AFTER TRYING TO PROGRAM IT IS COLLECTED AND YOU GET MEASURABLE RESULTS TO SEE IF IT'S SUCCESSFUL OR NOT WE BELIEVE THE MODEL WILL ALLOW MANY ON INDIVIDUALS TO GET WELL AND LEAD A PRODUCTIVE LIFE I URGE THIS COMMITTEE TO GIVE THIS PILOT PROGRAM A CHANCE THANK YOU ECURIE MUCH ANYONE ANYONE ELSE AND MY NAME IS GERRY BURKE I'M -- -- CASE MANAGER RE EMERGING SCHOLARS -- REENTRY PROGRAM FOR FORMERLY INCARCERATED AND SYSTEM IMPACTED STUDENTS WITHIN THE LOS RIOS DISTRICT AND I'M JUST HERE TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT OF MY EXPERIENCE DUE TO MY ADDICTION I SPENT MOST OF MY YOUTH AND EARLY ADULTHOOD DOING WHAT WAS EVER NECESSARY TO FIND DRUGS AND WAS IN AT A CORRECTIONAL INSTANCE INSTITUTIONS AND FACILITIES I GREW UP IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE DRUGS WERE THE NORM I DID ANYTHING NECESSARY TO OBTAIN THEM FROM GRAND THEFT AUTO TO STEAL ANYTHING OF VALUE OUT OF MY NEIGHBORS RAJ TO SELLING DRUGS NOTHING WAS OFF LIMITS IT TO OBTAIN DRUGS I VICTIMIZED MY COMMUNITY TO FEED MY ADDICTION OF MY SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES WERE NOT ONLY DESTROYING MY LIFE THEY'RE DESTROYING THE LIFE OF MY FAMILY MY WIFE MY CHILDREN AND BENCHLEY MY OWN SONS FOR OVER A TWENTY YEAR PERIOD OF MY LIFE THERE WAS NOTHING TO KEEP ME FROM USING NOT INCARCERATION NOT THE LOSS OF LOVED ONES OR EVEN THE BIRTH OF MY OWN SON THERE ARE MANY TIMES I THOUGHT ABOUT GETTING CLEAN YOU KNOW THOSE DAYS BEFORE OR YOU TO PROBATION AND I EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT IT MANY TIMES COMING HOME FROM WHATEVER CORRECTIONAL FACILITY I WAS COMING HOME FROM AT THAT TIME YOU KNOW AT THAT POINT MY LIFE I JUST WASN'T ABLE TO FUNCTION WITHOUT THE USE OF DRUGS -- DURING MY INCARCERATION I WAS NEVER OFFERED ANY SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROGRAMS NOR WERE THERE MANY ON THE YARDS I WAS ON AND WHETHER THEY AND WHETHER THERE WAS WANT IT AND WHERE THERE WAS ONE THAT CAME WITH THE LONG WAITING LISTS AND UNFAVORABLE REPUTATION ON THE ART MANY TIMES I WENT BACK ON PAROLE VIOLATION SISSETON RECEPTION IN THE YARD FOR FOUR TO SIX MONTHS THE ONE DRUG PROGRAM THAT I WAS FORCED INTO CAME AT THE END OF MY THIRTEEN YEARS OF INCARCERATION AND -- THESE FACILITIES HOWEVER THE FIRST TWO MONTHS FOR IN JAIL AND THAT WAS -- THE LAST TIME I GOT LOADED IF IT WASN'T FOR THE RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT FACILITY THEY SENT ME TO I WOULD HAVE NEVER FOUND MY PATH AND EDUCATION RIGHT RIGHT JUST RECEIVED MY

U. D. TREATMENT TO INDIVIDUALS WHILE INCARCERATED HOWEVER I CAN'T IGNORE THE OVERWHELMING OPPOSITION TO THE BILL THE STEEP IN RESEARCH AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES ABLE WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION AND ACCORDING TO WHAT YOU SAID TODAY YOU ACCEPTED OVER FIFTY AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS NOT ONLY THEIR OPPOSITION BUT ALSO THE GOVERNOR'S VETO FROM LAST YEAR I JUST HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS SO FIRST OF ALL YOUR BILL SUGGESTS THAT THE THE OPIOID SUMMIT MONIES FOR FUNDING THIS PROGRAM ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT THE STATE PORTION OF THE SETTLEMENT FUNDS BE USED WOULD BE USED OR WOULD INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES USE THEIR SETTLEMENT DOLLARS TO SUPPORT THESE PROGRAMS INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES AND MY FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS ARE GOING TO BE TO THE OPPOSITION -- I HEARD -- ONE OF THE OPPOSITION WHICH IS TO SAY THAT -- THAT THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE THE MEDIC HOW COULD YOU DO THIS SO SO CAN YOU EXPLAIN MORE ON WHY MEDICARE COULD NOT BE USED TO PAY FOR AB NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHT AS WELL AS THE PROBLEMS WITH USING THE OPIOID SETTLEMENT FUNDS AND YOUR CHAIR WIDE FOR THE QUESTION YEAH SO -- MEDIC HOW -- AS RESTRICTIONS ON IT IF THE PERSON IS CONSIDERED AN INMATE YOU CANNOT USE THE MEDIC HOW TO END UP COVERING THAT COST AVE AND THEN ALSO WE HAVE HAD EXPERIENCES WHERE IF A PERSON IS -- UNABLE TO HAVE FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT -- IN THE CASES -- THE -- MC ARE PEAS WHICH ARE PROGRAMS YOU CAN ALSO NOT USE MEDIC HOW TO END UP COVERING THE COST OF THAT CARE IT'S GONE ALL THE WAY UP TO SEE A MASS SO IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT MEDIC HOW COULD BE USED TO COVER IT NATIONALLY AND THE CIRCUMSTANCE AND LIKELY MANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS WOULD BE EXPANSION POPULATION COST IT WOULD COVER UP TO YOU YOU KNOW NINETY PERCENT OF THE COST SO IT'S A SIGNIFICANT LOSS AN EXTRA COSTS ON THE STATE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THANK YOU MY FINAL QUESTIONS COVER MULTIPLE PART QUESTION HERE SO CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE HARMON CREEK WHAT WHAT HARM IS IN CREATING A PILOT PROJECT YOU KNOW FIRST FOR SECURED RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT PROGRAM AND WHY THIS NEW CONCEPT IS WRONG FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE SURE HAVE A DANCER AND I APOLOGIZE I DIDN'T ACTUALLY ANSWER YOUR OTHER QUESTION ON THE OPIOID SETTLEMENT FUNDS -- I'M SORRY SHOULD BE DIRECTED TOWARDS ATKINS BATES PROGRAMS -- IT THERE'S BEEN A LARGE COM YOU KNOW COALITION -- I PRINCIPLES PUT OUT THERE BY JOHN HOPKINS UNIVERSITY ON IT THAT THESE FUND SHOULD BE DETERMINED BY I'M STAKEHOLDERS WITH A LOT OF STAKEHOLDER INPUT ON BE DIRECTED TOWARDS -- VICTIMS OF THE WAR ON DRUGS AND DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED COMMUNITIES AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE FUND SHOULD BE USED FOR PRACTICES THAT WE KNOW THAT WORK LIKE HARM REDUCTION RECOVERY RESIDENTS HOUSING I'M OUT REACH AND ENGAGEMENT -- AND TREATMENT MODELS THAT WE KNOW THAT WORKS I'M ON YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTION ON WHY WE BELIEVE THAT THE BILL IS PROGRAM WE'VE SEEN THAT PROGRAMS LIKE THIS HAPPEN BEFORE AND IN OTHER STATES WHERE THEY'VE USED -- COERCED OR MANDATED AND WE SEEN THAT THOSE MODELS HAVE NOT ENDED UP WORKING IT CAN FOSTER DISTRUST BETWEEN IT BETWEEN THE TREATMENT PROVIDER AND THE INDIVIDUAL THERE CAN BE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THERE'S INCREASED RISK OF OVERDOSE FOR THE PERSON COMING OUT OF THE PROGRAM AND WE SEE THAT THESE -- TYPES OF SITUATIONS BURNED BRIDGES AND AS WE'VE SAID BEFORE -- BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THE YOU CAN FOCUS ON -- INTENSIVE VOLUNTARY TREATMENT AND SEE JUST THE SAME KIND OF RESULTS OR IF NOT WORK SITE BETTER RESULTS THAN YOU COULD SEE UNDER THIS TYPE OF A PROGRAM AS WELL AS WE SEE THAT INDIVIDUALS DON'T HAVE TO BE -- IS THERE'S OTHER CHOICES BETWEEN THESE TWO CHOICES THANK YOU THANK YOU UP WOULD YOU CARE TO COMMENT MISTER MCCARTY YEAH THIS IS JUST A LOT TO MENTALLY UNPACK THERE THAT LONG LIST -- BUT DID NOT SELL AS IS IF THIS BILL SAID WHAT A LOT OF THE ARGUMENTS ROUTE LEADING I WOULDN'T BE UP HERE AUTHORED THIS BILL IS JUST NOT TRUE -- THERE'S A THERE'S NOT GONNA BE A LONGER SENTENCE FOR INDIVIDUALS WE CLEARLY SAYING THE BILL THAT THEY WOULD SERVE LAST TIME INTO THE STREET AND THEY WOULD BE SENTENCED OTHERWISE AND IT'S A FALSE CHOICE THAT THEY COULD YOU KNOW HAVE COMMUNITY WRAPAROUND TREATMENT AT HOME THE INDIVIDUAL HAS TWO CHOICES THEY CAN GO TO JAIL OR PRISON TO BE SENTENCE FOR A TERM FOR THAT SO THERE'S NOT GOING HOME WITH AN ANKLE BRACELET GETTING THE TREATMENT WHEN YOU WISH TO AROUND THE CORNER THAT'S NOT A CHOICE YOU'RE SOMEBODY IS INCENTIVES THEY CAN CERTAINLY DO THAT AND WE SHOULD DO WHAT MORE THAN ANYWAY THE ISSUE HERE IS WHAT PEOPLE ARE SENTENCED FOR A SIGNIFICANT TERM IN PRISONERS -- COUNTY JAIL HOW CAN YOU WORK WITH THEM TO ADDRESS ADDICTION ISSUE -- AND AS FAR AS THE IT IS BUT IT IS WITH VOLUNTARY WITH THE DATE PEOPLE CAN VOLUNTARY SAY YES TO THIS AND THEY CAN VOLUNTARILY LEAVE SO THERE'S A CHOICE SO THIS WEEK WE'RE NOT FORCING A SPARE OTHER WORDS IF IF I GET A THREE YEAR SENTENCE MISTER WOULD AND THAT THE PROVIDER SAY OKAY WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU PROGRAM YOU CAN DO TWENTY FOUR MONTHS INSTEAD IN THIS PROGRAM SO AFTER ONE MONTH I DECIDE YOU KNOW WHAT NOT FOR ME YOU CAN VOLUNTARILY LEAVE AND GO BACK TO YOUR SENTENCE RIGHT YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT FORCING PEOPLE TO MAKE THIS CHOICE WE WE TOOK THAT THAT NUMBER LAST YEAR ONE OF OUR FIFTY AMENDMENTS -- SO YOU KNOW I THINK THAT WE HAVE -- ADDRESSED THAT AND A NUMBER OF THESE ISSUES WELL THANK YOU I'M AYE AYES AYE WILL STILL SAY I HAVE SIGNIFICANT RESERVATIONS -- -- AS TO THE MERITS OF A SECURED FACILITY BUT I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THE BILL IN THE HOPES THAT YOU IN OPPOSITION CAN ARRIVE AT A CONCEPT THAT WILL BE CLINICALLY SOUND WHILE PROVIDING TREATMENT TO POPULATION WHOSE PRIMARY CRIMES ARE RELATED TO THEIR OBJECTION SO YOU'LL HAVE MY VOTE TODAY -- YOUR RECORD ALL UP AND AND BUT BUT I RESERVE MY VOTE ON THE FLOOR BASED ON HOW THINGS HOW THINGS GO FORWARD SO AND MISS WALDRON HAS A COMMON SORRY I WAS OUT OF THE ROOM -- LAST YEAR I HAD A BILL WHICH THE LANGUAGE IS INCORPORATED INTO A BUDGET BILL ONE THREE THREE THREE THAT -- LOOKED AT THE ISSUE OF MEDICAL COVERING PEOPLE WHO WERE INCARCERATED AND IT PASSED IN THE BUDGET BILL AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA COULD END UP BEING EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE OTHER STATES AHEAD BUT I THINK WE'LL BE WITH THE FIRST ONE TO GET APPROVAL OF FOUR FEDERAL WAIVER WILL ALLOW FOLKS BUT IT'S ONLY FOR THE NINETY DAYS PRIOR TO RELEASE WHERE THEY CAN GET INTO MEDICAL BEING ROLLED IN I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S HELPFUL IN HYDE IN ORDER TRYING TO DO BUT THAT IT WOULD THIS WAITING ON THE WAIVER RIGHT NOW OKAY ANY ANYONE ELSE ANY OTHER COMMENTS WE HAVE A MOTION MOTION BY MR SANTIAGO SECOND SECOND MINISTER FOR I'M PROMOTION TO SECOND THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS WHICH I CLOSE REGARDING THAT THANK YOU AND THIS IS NOT AN EASY ISSUE I UNDERSTAND THAT -- AND I APPRECIATE THE DIALOGUE ONE OF THE THINGS I NOTE IN IN THE LETTER FROM THE -- WHEN THE OPPONENTS THAT THE -- PUBLIC DEFENDERS AND CRIMINAL DEFENSE COUNSEL AS OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED THAT'S I THINK YOU KNOW A POSITIVE STATEMENT NO IT'S JUST FLAT OPPOSE AND I WILL SAY OF THAT FIVE THINGS HERE UP TO THEM YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE DOING IN THE BILL I THINK IT'S JUST THERE'S JUST A MISUNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IT DOES SO WE ARE WORKING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND UNDERSTAND THIS IS A LONG PROCESS AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE'S OPINIONS ARE EVOLVING ON THIS I WILL SAY YOU KNOW OUR GOVERNOR HE'S SOMEWHAT CHANGES POSITION ON SECURE TREATMENT OPTIONS FROM FOR PERSONS SUFFERING FROM MENTAL ILLNESS AND S. YOU AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS YOU SEE THAT RIGHT HERE HAS A MAJOR BILL THE SENATE'S GONNA COME OUT OUR SITES BIG PART OF OUR BUDGET DISCUSSION IS CARE COURT SO YOU KNOW THESE THINGS ARE EVOLVING BASED UPON -- THE THE SO -- I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE AND THE IMPLIED COLLEAGUES AS WELL AS ALL PARTIES AND RESPECTFULLY ASK THANK YOU THANK YOU MR MCCARTY SO THE MOTION IS TO PASS -- AS YOU PASS YOUR PREPARATION SO MA'AM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL WHAT I WOULD AYE WALDRON WALDRON AYE AGUIAR-CURRY AGUIAR-CURRY NOT VOTING ARAMBULA REGULAR I BIGELOW CARILLO LAURA LAURA I

WELL TO START OFF WITH EXCEPT IN THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS -- FENTON ALL AN OPIOID OVERDOSES AND POISONINGS -- HAVE BEEN RISING AT AN ALARMING RATE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND IN OUR DISTRICTS MANY OF THE VICTIMS OF OVERDOSES ESPECIALLY WITH FENNEL HAVE NO IDEA OF THE POTENCY OF THE DRUG WHICH IS MANY TIMES MORE POWERFUL THAN REGULAR OPIOIDS THANKFULLY IN RECENT YEARS MEDICAL ADVANCES HAVE BEEN MADE WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRODUCTS LIGHTEN OUR CAN WHICH CAN HELP THOSE IN TIMES OF NEED AB SIXTEEN TWENTY SEVEN WOULD GIVE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS THE ABILITY TO DISTRIBUTE OPIOID ANTAGONISE PRODUCTS SUCH AS NOT CAN'T APPROVED BY THE FDA TO ANYONE WHO COMPLETES A FREE TRAINING WITH THE DEPARTMENT NOT ONLY WOULD THESE TRAININGS INCLUDE INFORMATION ON HOW TO EFFECTIVELY USE THE OPIOID ANTAGONISE THEY WOULD ALSO INCLUDE TRAINING ON RECOGNIZING THE SIGNS OF ADDICTION IN AN EFFORT TO BE MORE PROACTIVE TO HEADING OFF A DRUG OVERDOSE IN ADDITION TO THOSE THESE TRAININGS AB SIXTEEN TWENTY SEVEN WOULD ALSO GIVE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT THE POWER AND ABILITY TO CREATE OVERDOSE RESPONSE TEAMS WITH THE SOLE PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATING THESE DEATHS AND FINALLY IN THE CARS TOO OFTEN WE LOSE LOVED ONES TO ADDICTION WITHOUT REALIZING THEY ARE AFFLICTED AB SIXTEEN TWENTY SEVEN WHAT A TEMP TO CHANGE THE PERSPECTIVE IN WHICH WE APPROACH THIS ADDICTION AND PROVIDE US WITH A MORE UNDERSTANDING VIEW OF THIS CRISIS WITH ME TODAY TO OFFER TESTIMONY IS STEVE FILSON A RETIRED SAMBAR DINO POLICE OFFICER BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY STEVE LOST HIS DAUGHTER OF TWENTY NINE YEARS JESSICA TO THIS OPIOID CRISIS SINCE THEN STEVE HAS BEEN INVOLVED WITH THE VICTIMS OF ILLICIT DRUGS ACRONYM VOID THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL AND EDUCATE AND BRING AWARENESS TO THIS ISSUE THANK YOU THANK YOU PLEASE PLEASE GO AHEAD WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE MY NAME IS STEVE OLSON I'M A RESIDENT OF THE CITY OF HIGHLAND ALONG WITH MY WIFE SHERRY AND A FIVE YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER LARA I'M ALSO THE TREASURER OF VICTIMS OF ILLICIT DRUGS AND A RETIRED SERGEANT FROM THE SENATE IN A POLICE DEPARTMENT MOST IMPORTANTLY I AM JESSICA'S DAD JESSICA WAS OUR TWENTY NINE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WHO DIED BECAUSE OF FENTANYL TOXICITY ON JANUARY TWENTY SECOND TWENTY TWENTY SINCE THAT TIME MY FAMILY AND MANY OTHERS ABOUT TOGETHER AND DEDICATED OUR LIVES TO THE PURPOSE OF EDUCATION AND AWARENESS OF THE EVER ESCALATING DEATHS DUE TO VICTIMS UNKNOWINGLY INGESTING THIS POWERFUL SYNTHETIC POISSON ORGANIZATIONS SPEAKS OF THREE OVERRIDING FACTORS FIRST OF ALL FENTON ALL CHANGES EVERYTHING SECONDLY BUT FOR PHANTOM ALL OUR LOVED ONES WOULD STILL BE ALIVE AND LAST FEDERAL IS A PROBLEM THAT MOST DON'T EVEN KNOW EXISTS EDUCATION AND AWARENESS WILL HELP TO REDUCE THE LACK OF KNOWLEDGE AND IS THE FIRST AND MOST FUNDAMENTAL STEP OF HARM REDUCTION WE'RE BEGINNING TO SEE A BIT MORE CONSISTENT MEDIA ATTENTION TO THE PROBLEM BUT A MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE EFFORT NEEDS TO BE UNDERTAKEN NATIONALLY AND WITHIN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES WE MUST REALIZE THAT A LISTED FENTANYL IS FIFTY TIMES STRONGER THAN HEROIN AND A HUNDRED TIMES STRONGER THAN MORPHINE A SUBSTANCE WITH THIS ADDICTIVE AND FATAL POTENTIAL NEEDS THE ATTENTION NECESSARY TO MITIGATE THESE DEATHS TWO EXTREMELY IMPORTANT COMPONENTS TO THAT END EXIST IN THE LANGUAGE OF BABY SIXTEEN TWENTY

NASAL SPRAY NALOXONE IS SAFE AND EASY TO USE IT QUICKLY REVERSES AN OVERDOSE BY BLOCKING THE ADVERSE EFFECTS AND CAN RESTORE NORMAL BREATHING WITHIN TWO TO THREE MINUTES AND A PERSON WHO'S BROUGHT

THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE TWENTY FOUR OH TWO AND THE COMMITTEE HERE TODAY AB TWENTY FOUR OH TWO WOULD PROVIDE CONTINUOUS MEDICAL COVERAGE FOR CHILDREN AGES ZERO TO FIVE IN CALIFORNIA MIKHAIL'S PREVENTATIVE CARE RATES FOR YOUNG CHILDREN ARE DISMALLY LOW AND THE PANDEMIC HAS ONLY INCREASED THOSE RATES AREN'T WELL CHILD OF PREVENTIVE CARE IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT WHEN NINETY PERCENT OF THE BRAIN DEVELOPMENT OCCURS DURING THIS PERIOD THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS RECOMMENDS FOURTEEN WELL CHILD VISITS TO ADMINISTER CRITICAL PREVENTATIVE CARE -- SUCH AS IMMUNIZATIONS AND TRACKING DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES BECAUSE MEDICAL IS THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF COVERAGE FOR CHILDREN OF COLOR MEDI CAL'S LOW PREVENTATIVE CARE RATES DISPROPORTIONATELY DEPRIVE CHILDREN OF COLOR OF ESSENTIAL HEALTH SERVICES WORSENING CHILD HEALTH INEQUITIES THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES HAS DATA WHICH INDICATES THAT ABOUT TEN PERCENT OF YOUNG CHILDREN EXPERIENCED TURN IN THE MEDICAL COVERAGE MEANING THEY LOSE MEDICAL COVERAGE AND THEN RETURN THE AMOUNT THAT AMOUNTS TO ABOUT NINETY THOUSAND CHILDREN AGES ZERO TO FIVE A MEDIC CAL HAVING A GAP IN COVERAGE ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FOUR OH TWO WILL AND THESE GAPS BY PROVIDING CONTINUOUS COVERAGE CONTINUES COVERAGE WILL IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR LOW INCOME CHILDREN WHILE ALSO ADDRESSING THE AN EQUAL IMPACT OF THE COVERED NINETEEN PANDEMIC ON COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY AND I HAVE A WITNESSES HERE GREAT THANK YOU THIS GRANT THANK YOU CHAIRMAN WOULD AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M KRISTIN GOLDEN TESTED WITH THE CHILDREN'S PARTNERSHIP HERE AS A PROUD I'M A CO SPONSOR OF THIS LEGISLATION -- TO STABILIZE CONTINUOUS COVERAGE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN IN MEDIC CAL THIS IS A BUILDING ON AN EXISTING POLICY THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW A MEDIC CAL CALLED TWELVE MONTHS CONTINUOUS COVERAGE AND THE PURPOSE IS THE SAME WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT CHILDREN ARE MAINTAIN EARNING THEIR COVERAGE AN ADMINISTRATIVE -- PROCEDURES THAT -- WHEN THEY'RE ALREADY ELIGIBLE WE DON'T WANT THEM LOSING COVERAGE AND IT'S ALSO SIMILAR TO THE PROCESS THAT WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW DURING THIS PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY WHERE ACROSS THE COUNTRY -- EVERYBODY IN MEDICAID IS ALLOWED TO MAINTAIN THEIR COVERAGE AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS IN RECOGNITION THAT THERE ARE PARTICULAR PERIODS AND IN TIME WHEN IT'S IMPORTANT TO PRIORITIZE AND PROTECT COVERAGE AND EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT IS ONE OF THOSE TIMES THAT WE WANT TO PROTECT AND MAKE SURE CHILDREN KEEP THEIR COVERAGE -- THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN RIGHTFULLY POINTED OUT HOW IMPORTANT HEALTHY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT IS AND MAKING SURE THEY GET THOSE VISITS ANY MISSING OF TIME EVEN IF IT'S FOR A SHORT GAP OF TIME A MONTH THREE MONTHS OF MISSING COVERAGE MEANS THAT THEY MAY MISS ONE OF THOSE IMPORTANT FOURTEEN VISITS AND THERE'S NO MAKING IT UP THEIR CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT IS HAPPENING SO FAST EACH ONE OF THEM IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND HAS ALSO MENTIONED THIS IS A PIVOTAL TIME FOR CHILDHOOD EQUITY -- IN THAT THAT THESE CHILDREN AS THIS IS THEIR START IN THEIR LIVES AND MEDIC CAL IS COVERING -- A THREE FOURTHS OF THE CHILDREN IN MEDIC HOW ARE CHILDREN OF COLOR SO THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY MEDIC HOUSE RATES UNFORTUNATELY ARE VERY LOW RIGHT NOW AND PREVENTIVE CARE AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO MAKE AN IMPACT ON THEM IS THAT WE START MAKING SURE THEY HAVE CONTINUOUS COVERAGE AND CAN GET THOSE VISITS I'M I WANT TO REITERATE THESE ARE ELIGIBLE CHILDREN THESE ARE CHILDREN WE'VE ALREADY MADE AN OBLIGATION TO COVER AND WE WANT TO CONTINUE THAT COVERAGE AND THERE'S NO REASON WHY WE SHOULD BE A NOT HAVING THEM HAVE CONTINUED COVERAGE I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT -- IN UP IN WASHINGTON STATE AND OREGON STATE THEY ARE SEEKING AND HAVE MADE SOME THAT MEANT GOVERNMENT FOR THAT SO WE'RE FOLLOWING IN THEIR TRACKS LET'S NOT LEAVE OUR STATE OUR CHILDREN BEHIND AND IN THAT I'D LIKE TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN RUBIO FOR HER CHAMPIONING OF THIS BILL OUR NEXT TO -- SPEAKER ABOUT HOW ON THE EXPERIENCE IS FOR FAMILIES WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO KEEP THEIR COVERAGE FOR THEIR CHILDREN MEDIC CAL THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRPERSON WATER MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY HEALTH COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DIANA GARCIA I'M A DAD I'M POLICY ANALYST AT FIRST FIVE ALAMEDA COUNTY HERE TODAY TO SUPPORT AB TWENTY FOUR OH TWO WHICH WOULD MAKE MEDICAL CONTINUES ELIGIBILITY AVAILABLE TO ALL ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN UNTIL THEIR FIFTH BIRTHDAY FIRST FIVE ALAMEDA COUNTY IS COMMITTED TO ADVOCATING FOR AN ACHIEVING EQUITY WITH THE FOCUS ON RACIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE TO ENSURE THAT ALL CHILDREN IN ALAMEDA COUNTY ARE BORN HEALTHY AND CAN ACHIEVE THEIR FULL POTENTIAL OVER THE YEARS ARE ALAMEDA COUNTY KINDERGARTEN READINESS ASSESSMENT HAS FOUND THAT DIFFERENCES IN KINDERGARTEN READINESS ARE LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO INEQUITIES IN ACCESS TO RESOURCES AND THE GREATEST MOVABLE FACTOR CONTINUES TO BE CHILD HEALTH AND WELLBEING MEDICAL SERVES AS A PRIMARY SOURCE OF COVERAGE FOR OVER TWENTY PERCENT OF CHILDREN AGES ZERO TO SIX AND ALAMEDA COUNTY -- THIS COVERAGE OVER THIRTY TWO THOUSAND CHILDREN CAN ACCESS PEDIATRICS SERVICES THERAPIES INCLUDING SPEECH OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY PHYSICAL THERAPY AND APPLIED BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES MEDICAL COVERAGE IS CRITICAL FOR THE HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN ESPECIALLY THOSE IN FAMILIES EXPERIENCING A GREATER DEGREE OF VOLATILITY AND EMPLOYMENT INCOME AND HOUSING HOWEVER OVER THE YEARS WE HAVE HEARD COUNTLESS STORIES FROM FAMILIES EXPERIENCING DISRUPTIONS IN THEIR ACCESS TO CARE DURING THEIR CHILD'S FIRST TWO YEARS OF LIFE BECAUSE OF THE CONFUSING AN OVER COMPLICATED REDETERMINATION PROCESS AND ALAMEDA COUNTY CHALLENGES LEADING TO PERIODS OF LOST COVERAGE AT THE MOST ARE MOST OFTEN CAUSED BY OVERWHELMING AMOUNTS OF PAPERWORK REQUIREMENTS TO SHOW PROOF OF INCOME WHEN IT DOESN'T ALIGN WITH THE TYPE OF WORK FAMILIES TO TIGHT DEADLINES BETWEEN THE TIME FAMILIES RECEIVED A NOTICE FOR RE CERTIFICATION AND THE DEADLINE TO FILE LONG WAIT TIMES OVER THE PHONE AND AND OFFICES FOR SUPPORT AND CONTINUED FEAR DUE TO IMMIGRATION STATUS ENTRANCE MEDICAL LEGIBILITY SURE REMAIN A STANDARD PRACTICE FOR CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF FIVE AFTER THE FEDERAL COVER NINETEEN PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY IS LIFTED SO THAT CHILDREN RECEIVE TIMELY ACCESS TO PREVENTATIVE HEALTH SERVICES AS WELL AS EARLY INTERVENTION TO MITIGATE LEARNING DEVELOPMENTAL AND SOCIAL EMOTIONAL DELAYS CHILDREN NOT LOSE COVERAGE DURING THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF LIFE BECAUSE OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND SYSTEMIC BARRIERS THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT FAMILIES OF COLOR MEDICAL FAMILIES ALREADY HAVE SO MANY HURDLES TO OVERCOME JUST TO GET BY GETTING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SHOULD NOT BE ONE MORE IT IS IN OUR COLLECTIVE INTEREST TO COLOR CULTIVATE THE CONDITIONS NEEDED TO SUPPORT CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT ESPECIALLY IN THE EARLIEST YEARS OF LIFE SO EVERY CHILD CAN REACH THEIR FULL POTENTIAL AND TO CONTRIBUTE TO OUR STATE'S FUTURE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC PROSPERITY FOR THESE REASONS WE SUPPORT YOUR WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND AB TWENTY FOUR TWO THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANYONE IN

B. TWO ZERO SEVEN NINE BY CHAIRMAN WHAT FOR SAM I DO IS TOUCH THE MICROPHONE EVEN THOUGH SAID NOT TO -- FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS PROUD TO PRESENT AB TWENTY SEVENTY NINE THIS COMMITTEE HAS SPENT SIGNIFICANT TIME OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WORKING TO IMPROVE THE CARE THAT NURSING HOME RESIDENTS RECEIVE I'M PROUD OF MUCH OF THE WORK WE'VE DONE BUT WE STILL NEED TO DO MORE THIS BILL MAKE SOME NOTE WORTHY AND IMPORTANT CHANGES AND HOW SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES WILL MANAGE THEIR MONEY AND IT WILL IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF CARE THAT RESIDENTS RECEIVE THE BILL REQUIRES A FACILITY TO SPEND EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF ITS TOTAL REVENUES ON DIRECT PATIENT CARE MUCH THE SAME WAY THAT INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE ALREADY REQUIRED TO PUT EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF REVENUES INTO PATIENT CARE THROUGH THE USE OF MEDICAL LOSS RATIOS RIGHT PATIENT CARE INCLUDES AN APPROPRIATELY SO STAFFING WAGES BENEFITS THERAPY SUPPLIES PHARMACY PLANT OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE LAUNDRY AND DIETARY ALL THE THINGS THAT DIRECTLY BENEFIT A RESIDENT OF ITS OF A NURSING HOME NON DIRECT CARE WON'T COUNT TOWARDS THAT EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT REDUCE SPENDING REQUIREMENT AND INCLUDES ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS EXECUTIVE WAGES PAYMENT TO MANAGEMENT COMPANIES HOME OFFICE EXPENSES FOR PARENT COMPANIES AND PROFITS PAID TO CONTRACTORS ARE RELATED PARTY ENTITIES AMONG OTHER THINGS WE HAD A CONTENT PER COMPREHENSIVE INTERIM HEARING LAST OCTOBER ON LICENSING OF SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES HEARD MUCH ABOUT WHAT ARE CALLED RELATED PARTIES DURING THE TESTIMONY AND HOW THEY CAN SIPHON PROFITS OUT OF THESE FACILITIES MONEY THAT COULD HAVE AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN SPENT ON RESIDENTS FOR EXAMPLE I DON'T WANT FACILITY OWNERS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF LOOPHOLES THAT ALLOW COMPANIES THAT OWN SAY FIVE FACILITIES USE A RELATED ENTITY THEY ALSO OWN TO BUILD THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS EVERY MONTH IN ADMINISTRATIVE FEES OR USE A LAUNDRY COMPANY THEY ALSO OWN THE BILL EACH OF THEIR FACILITIES WHAT MAY BE OVER MARKET FEES FOR SERVICES THE BILL BUILDS UPON EXISTING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DEPARTMENT HELP OF FOR THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO AUDIT NURSING HOME IT MEDIKAL SPENDING AND FOR THOSE FACILITIES REPORT FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND INFORMATION THE BILL REQUIRES THE TO DO DEPARTMENTS TO LOOK AT THE INFORMATION WHEN REVIEWING THE FACILITY REPORTS ON REVENUES AND THEN DECIDE IF THE EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT SPENDING REQUIREMENT WAS MET IF DOT DH CS WHICH ALREADY HAS A MECHANISM FOR CALLING BACK MEDICARE PAYMENTS AND DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH WITH LICENSEES LICENSES THESE FACILITIES REQUIRE THAN PROVIDE REBATES TO THE PAIR'S MEDI CAL MEDICARE OR PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANIES SIMILAR TO THE MLR AS WE REQUIRE OF INSURANCE COMPANIES WHEN A STOP HERE I'M GONNA GIVE MY TWO WITNESSES TO COVER ANYTHING I'VE MISSED WE HAVE WITH US TODAY CHARLENE HARRINGTON A PROFESSOR IS PROFESSOR EMERITA UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO REPRESENTING THE GERIATRIC CIRCLE AND INFORMAL STATEWIDE GROUP OF OF OF JERIT ACADEMIC GERIATRIC EXPERTS THAT'S A MOUTHFUL -- AT TWENTY AND TWENTY TWO COULD TELL WITH THE CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES FOR NURSING HOME REFORM MS HARRINGTON HAS DONE IMPORTANT RESEARCH IN THIS AREA AND WILL BE ABLE TO TELL YOU JUST HOW PROFITABLE THESE FACILITIES CAN BE THESE BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THEIR GERIATRIC CIRCLES STRONGLY SUPPORTS AB TWENTY SEVENTY NINE BECAUSE OF THIS BILL WOULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF SHIFTING AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY ONE PERCENT OF REVENUES INTO DIRECT CARE UP FOR CLOSE TO A BILLION DOLLARS IN CALIFORNIA WE THINK IT WOULD HAVE FOUR MAJOR BENEFITS FIRST IT WOULD INCLUDE ENCOURAGE HIGHER STAFFING LEVELS AND WAGES AND WE KNOW THAT MANY NURSING HOMES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE HAD A HISTORY OF INADEQUATE STAFFING AND THIS IS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER COVED NINETEEN RESIDENT INSPECTION RIGHTS AND DEATH RATES AND MANY OTHER SERIOUS QUALITY PROBLEMS AT NURSING HOME STAFF WAGES CONTINUE TO BE LOW AND TURNOVER RATES ARE AS HIGH AS FIFTY PERCENT THE SECOND BENEFIT IS THAT IT WOULD CONTROL EXCESS PROFITS EVEN THOUGH PATIENT DAYS AN OCCUPANCY RATES IN CALIFORNIA NURSING HOMES DROPPED IN TWENTY TWENTY THE PROFITS OF NURSING HOMES WERE SIX PERCENT AND SOME NURSING HOMES EVEN HAD FIFTEEN TO THIRTY PERCENT PROFITS WE ALSO KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT RATES ARE ADEQUATE BECAUSE THE DAILY RATES ARE NINETY ONE PERCENT OF MEDICARE RATES IN TWENTY TWENTY AND OF COURSE THE DAILY RATES SHOULD BE UP FOR MEDICARE SHOULD BE A LITTLE HIGHER BECAUSE THOSE ARE FOR POST ACUTE RESIDENTS THAT REQUIRE MORE REHAB AND NURSING CARE THE THIRD BENEFIT IS THAT IT WOULD DISCOURAGE AND REDUCE HIDDEN PROFITS AND HIDDEN MANAGEMENT CAUGHT COST WHERE AT NURSING HOMES SIPHON THIS MONEY OFF INTO THE ROOM RELATED PARTY COMPANIES AND FINALLY OF WE THINK IT WOULD ENCOURAGE REDUCTIONS IN EXCESS PROPERTY COST WE KNOW THAT SOME PROPERTY OF OWNERS CHARGE EXCESSIVE RATES STUDENTS TO THE NURSING HOME COMPANIES AND SOME HAVE LEASE AGREEMENTS THAT HAVE THREE TO FIVE PERCENT INCREASES BUILT RIGHT INTO THE LEASE EACH YEAR AND THIS PULLS UP REVENUES AWAY FROM RESIDENT CARE IN SUMMARY OF THIS LEGISLATION IS SIMILAR TO LEGISLATION PASSED IN NEW JERSEY NEW YORK AND MASSACHUSETTS LAST YEAR AND THE BILL WOULD HAVE IT ENSURE GREATER FINANCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND IMPROVED NURSING HOME QUALITY THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON I'M TONY CHECK ITSELF WITH CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES FOR NURSING HOME REFORM IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB TWO ZERO SEVEN NINE THE TIMING IS INTERESTING HERE JUST YESTERDAY THERE WAS AN ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE HEARING WHERE THE NURSING HOME FINANCING RE AUTHORIZATION OF THE FINANCING SYSTEM RE AUTHORIZATION WAS DISCUSSED N. HERE IT IT'S VIRTUALLY GUARANTEED THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS GOING TO PROPOSE GIVING THE INDUSTRY MORE AND MORE MONEY EVERY YEAR THEY GET RAISES AND EVERY YEAR THE QUALITY STAYS ABOUT THE SAME AND IT'S IT'S NEVER BEEN VERY GOOD WHEN THE CURRENT FINANCING SYSTEM WAS SET UP IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR THERE WERE BIG PROMISES MADE THAT HEY WE GET MORE MONEY YOU'RE GOING TO GET BETTER CARE THINGS WILL IMPROVE AND THAT JUST HAS NOT HAPPENED I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS BILL WHICH WOULD WOULD BE A MAJOR REFORM TO ESTABLISH A DIRECT CARE -- MINIMUM EXPENDITURE AS AS DR HARRINGTON MENTIONED OTHER STATES HAVE DONE THIS THE PANDEMIC HAS BEEN DEVASTATING TO THE STAFF AND THE RESIDENTS IN FACILITIES AND IT'S TIME THAT WE REALLY ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES AND GET REAL REFORM AND WE STARTED LAST YEAR WE HAD A NUMBER WE HAD FOR BILLS THAT WERE VERY REFORM ORIENTED PASSED LAST YEAR PART OF THE PROTECT PLAN I THINK WE HAVE SOME MORE WORK TO DO I THINK THIS THIS BILL GOES A LONG WAY TO DOING THAT AND IF IF YOU'RE ALL INTERESTED IN SEEING WHAT WHAT WE'RE GETTING AT YOU MIGHT WANNA TAKE A LOOK AT A LAWSUIT THAT WAS FILED IN NEW YORK STATE AT THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE NEW YORK IS AHEAD OF US THEY PASSED THIS LAW ON TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THEY'RE SENDING SEVENTY PERCENT REQUIRING SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE REVENUE BE SPENT ON DIRECT CARE IN THIS LAWSUIT THE NURSING HOME WITH TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT NURSING HOMES BANDED TOGETHER TO TRY TO STOP THE IMPLEMENTATION THIS LAW AND IN THEIR OWN COMPLAINT THEY TALKED ABOUT AN AVERAGE OF THREE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS PER NURSING HOME BEING SPENT ON THINGS THAT WERE NOT DIRECT CARE AND WE'RE BEYOND THE AMOUNT ALLOTTED TO THEM BY THE STATE OF NEW YORK FOR NON DIRECT CARE THREE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS PER FACILITY THAT'S REAL MONEY THAT COULD HELP A LOT OF RESIDENTS SO WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU ARE DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD GOOD AFTERNOON JENNIFER SNYDER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH FACILITIES AND FIRST WANT TO SAY THAT TO -- WE WE TRULY APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S INTENT THAT HE HAS WITH RESPECT TO LOOKING AT QUALITY CARE I'M IN NURSING HOMES AND AND WE HAVE ENJOYED MANY CONVERSATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS WITH IN THAT REGARD AND I THINK FOR US -- THIS BILL AT LEAST AS IT'S CURRENTLY WRITTEN WE DON'T FEEL AT LEAST IN ITS CURRENT FORM REALLY ADDRESSES WHERE WE NEED TO GO WITH QUALITY CARE AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO TALK ABOUT QUALITY CARE I THINK THE BILL IS MISSING A FEW ITEMS THAT I'D LIKE TO JUST SHARE WITH YOU TODAY I THINK FIRST AND FOREMOST I THINK IT'S FIRST IMPORTANT FOR -- THE STATE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE REASONABLE COSTS -- AND A PART OF THAT IS LOOKING AT -- WHAT'S WHAT'S STARTING TO BE REPORTED I HAD TO -- H. CHI THE OLD ARE SPENT SENATOR STERN LAST YEAR ON SB SIX FIFTY LOOKS AT WAYS THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TRANSPARENT NURSING FACILITIES CAN BE TRANSPARENT ABOUT WHAT THEIR COSTS ARE AND WHAT THEIR TRANSACTIONS AND RELATIONSHIPS ARE WITH THEIR RELATED PARTIES SO ONCE WE'RE ABLE TO DETERMINE KIND OF WHAT THOSE -- THOSE TRANSPARENT RESOURCES ARE HOW THEY'RE UTILIZING THOSE THOSE RESOURCES THEN WE CAN THEN TAKE THE NEXT STEP TO DETERMINE MAYBE WHAT'S APPROPRIATE AND WHAT'S NOT APPROPRIATE TO BE SPENDING ON PATIENT CARE SO WE THINK FIRST AND FOREMOST THAT THE BILL AT LEAST AT THIS POINT IS PREMATURE AND TWO WE THINK THAT IF WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT ANY TYPE OF RESTRICTIONS ON -- WHAT A FACILITY SPANS WE FIRST NEED TO MAKE SURE IF FOR ASSURING QUALITY CARE THAT FACILITIES MEDICAL PROGRAM AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT YOU KNOW WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO OUR PREVIOUS SPEAKERS MEDICARE PROGRAM IS A PARTNER WITH NURSING FACILITIES THEY MAKE UP AT LEAST TWO THIRDS OF THE PAYMENT FOR THOSE FACILITIES ISN'T A MANY CASES WE KNOW FOR A FACT THAT THEY UNDER PAY FOR THE SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED SO I DID WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THIS NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT -- TOGETHER BOTH WITH ARE WE MAKING SURE THAT OUR STATE GOVERNMENT FUNDS ARE PROBABLY PAYING FOR PATIENT CARE BEFORE WE DETERMINE WHAT RESOURCES ARE APPROPRIATE TO BE SPENT OR NOT SPENT AND THEN -- LASTLY I JUST WANT TO MENTION THAT -- I'M REALLY I THINK THE KEY CONCERNS THAT -- CENTER AT LEAST FOR -- CALF IS AROUND THE DEFINITION OF WHAT'S CONSIDERED TO BE PATIENT CARE IN THE BILL RIGHT NOW -- IN THAT DEFINITION LEAVES OUT WHAT WE CONSIDER TO BE SOME IMPORTANT PATIENT CARE RELATED COSTS ONE BEING RENTS OR LEASES OTHERS INSURANCE OTHER TYPES OF FEES ARE OVERSIGHT THAT ARE REQUIRED TO KEEP THE DOORS OPEN AND THE LIGHTS ON AND ESPECIALLY RENTS AND LEASES UNDERSTAND THERE MIGHT BE CONCERNS ABOUT HOW MUCH THAT IS OR OR WHAT THOSE AMOUNTS SHOULD BE -- BUT IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE -- AREN'T FACTORING THAT IN SO I APPRECIATE SAID THE COMMITTEE'S TIME TODAY BUT M.
