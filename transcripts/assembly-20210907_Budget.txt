GREAT THANK YOU LET ME JUST TURN OVER TO THE COMMUNITY. QUESTIONS MR FALL. BUT I THINK IT WAS CHAIR. I WANT TO COMMEND YOU ON THE WORK THAT SAY YOU PUT IN OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS CERTAINLY IS NO EASY TASK- INFO IN TERMS OF THE QUESTIONS I HAVE I'LL JUST JUMP FROM- TRAILER BILL THE TRAILER BILL AND- IN THE MAYBE WE JUST- LEAD TO I GUESS WE'LL SEE WHERE THE QUESTIONS GO BUT IN TERMS OF THE RESOURCES BILL- AS CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE CONTINUED APPROPRIATIONS WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT- FOR US IN THE ASSEMBLY REPUBLICANS THAT WE'VE BEEN ASKING FOR. BUT IN TERMS OF- THE DROUGHT. FOCUSING ON THAT FOR A MOMENT- CERTAINLY WE'RE FACING A VERY SEVERE DROUGHT CONDITIONS- BY THE MOST SEVERE WE'VE WE'VE HAD SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN. WHAT IT TO THE DEPARTED FINANCE WHAT IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN. TO ADDRESS WATER STORAGE IS THERE ANY FUNDING IN THIS. BUDGET FOR WHAT ADDITIONAL WATER STORAGE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION- MR FONG I'LL TURN THAT QUESTION THE ANSWER TO OVER TO SERGIO A DEALER FOR SOME DETAILS. HI GOOD MORNING SIR DO I GOT WITH THE PART OF FINANCE SO THIS BUDGET DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY SPECIFIC ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR WATER STORAGE. HOWEVER I DO WANNA TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE OF THE PROP ONE FUNDING WHICH I DON'T HAVE BEEN PART OF THAT DISCUSSION OVER THE PAST FEW HEARINGS SO THERE WAS. TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS AWARDED OR THAT WAS- ALLOCATED AND PART OF PROP ONE THERE'S SEVEN- PROJECT THAT WERE CUT CONDITIONALLY AWARDED AND RIGHT NOW THOSE PROJECTS ARE GOING- BEFORE THE WATER COMMISSION. TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DETAILS TO BE ABLE TO- CANCEL STATUTE THE PROJECT AND GET BASICALLY THE GREEN LIGHT TO MOVE FORWARD TO THE NEXT STEP. AND SO THAT THAT THE OCCURRING OVER THE NEXT TWO MONTHS- AND- PROP ONE HAD A DEADLINE OF. BY JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY TWO THAT WOULD NEED TO BE COMPLETED AND THEN AFTER THAT WE ACTUALLY ANTICIPATE ALL SEVEN PROJECTS. WOULD RECEIVE THE APPROVAL AT THIS POINT IN TIME. AND THEN THOSE PROJECTS AND MOVE FORWARD WITH- THE ADDITIONAL- KIND OF PERMITTING AND THEN CONSTRUCTION NEEDED SO THOSE SENATE PROJECT OUT PART OF THAT THE PROP ONE FUNDING. WITH TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS OTHER KIND OF IN THE Q. WORKING THROUGH THE PROCESS BUT THE NEXT TWO MONTHS BASICALLY- BUT PIVOTAL POINT. FOR THOSE PROJECTS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE FINAL DOCUMENTS GET FINAL APPROVAL. AT THE MOVE FORWARD WITH THE PROJECT. SO I APPRECIATE THE TO PROP ONE BY. IT'S THE WAY THE FOR A MINOR STANDING IS THE PROBLEM FUND WILL COME ALL THESE PROJECTS. IS THAT TRUE. SO AT THAT POINT WE WOULD THEN HAVE TO SUPPLEMENT THEM. SO THAT I GUESS A BIT GOES BACK TO MY ORIGINAL POINT OF WHY DOES THE ADMINISTRATION NOT BELIEVE THERE NEEDS TO BE ANY FUNDING FOR WATER STORAGE IN THIS CURRENT BUDGET TO SUPPLEMENT WHAT WAS IN PROP ONE. YEAH I THINK WELL NOTED THAT PART OF THE PROBLEM REQUIREMENTS IT DOES- THE PROJECTS WHICH ARE. HI COMMITTEE WATER DISTRICTS ARE THE ONE PUTTING FOR THE PROJECT THEY DO NEED A SO. KIND OF WHAT ADDITIONAL FINANCING MECHANISMS IN ADDITION TO THE TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS A STATE OF PUTTING FORWARD. TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE OTHER SHARE COST- AND THEN JUST KIND LAST YEAR ALTHOUGH. THE ENTIRE WATER PACKAGE THAT BE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE WORKED- INCLUDE IN THE JUNE BUDGET AND A COMBINED WITH THE BUDGET. IS OFF FIVE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS I GO TO LOOK TO- KIND OF MANY DIFFERENT DROUGHT. WATER SUPPLY WATER RELIABILITY- TYPE PROGRAMS- BUT AGAIN YOU KNOW THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY AVAILABLE FOR WATER STORAGE. THAT IS CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS. OKAY SO BUT JUST TO BE CLEAR OF THE FIVE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS THAT YOU'VE THAT YOU'VE OUTLINED. NONE THERE'S NOT. ONE DOLLAR FOR WATER STORE EDITION WATER STORAGE. NO NOT FOR THE NOT FOR THE DIGITAL A LARGE WATER STORAGE PROJECTS NOT. OKAY- THAT IS THAT IT IS VERY DISAPPOINTING- IN TERMS OF THE- THE ALAMEDA. TESLA EXPANSION AREA AND THE CLOSURE OF THE- AT THE CARNEGIE S. V. R. A. M. CAN THE THAT'S THE BUMMER FINANCE CAN ADMINISTRATION EXPLAINED WHY THIS AREA IS PROPOSED TO BE CLOSED AND EXPLAINED WHICH AREAS ARE BEING CONSIDERED AS ALTERNATIVES. YES I'LL TRY THAT AGAIN TO- SERGIO FOR MORE DETAILS. GOOD MORNING MIKE MCGINNIS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- BE ALAMEDA TEST LIKE TO MENTION AREA HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS HAVING GAS GIVEN THE CULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES THAT STAKEHOLDERS HAVE A- PUSH TO HAVE PRESERVED AND TO THIS POINT IN TIME. THE ADMINISTRATION IS COMMITTED TO PRESERVING THOSE RESOURCES BUT HAS NOT IDENTIFIED A NEW LOCATION FOR- WHICH WE ACTIVITY THIS- TRAILER BILL WOULD TRANSFER FUNDS. FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO THAT WHICH WE TRUST FUND WOULD NOT ACTUALLY APPROPRIATE FUNDS TO ACQUIRE ANY NEW- SPACE AT THIS POINT IN TIME. ANY SUCH REQUEST TO COMES IN A FUTURE BUDGET PROPOSAL. SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS WAS MOVING THROUGH THE POLICY PROCESS- AT THE LEGISLATURE SO I'M I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. THE KIND OF YOUR YOUR TRADING A LOT MORE UNCERTAINTY BECAUSE YOU AS YOU INDICATED THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE BEING DISCUSSED CORD THAT YOU'VE IDENTIFIED. SO WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE TO THE OAG COMMUNITY WHO UTILIZES THIS- RECREATION AREA THERE YOU'RE ACTUALLY TAKING AWAY- RECREATION. SO THE ALAMEDA TESLA EXPANSIONARY IS NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR- EACH WEEK USE- THE PROPERTY WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE HAPPEN YEAH OUR PROCESS IN THAT. THE GENERAL PLAN WOULD HAVE TO BE CREATED WE HAVE TO BUILD OUT OF THE PARK FOURTH WOULD HAPPEN. WELL THERE'S NOT A SPECIFIC- NEW PARK THAT IS PROPOSED AS A PART OF THIS TRAILER BILL THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS RECREATION IS CURRENTLY EXPLORING- KENNEDYS WE DO ANTICIPATE THAT WE'LL HAVE SOMETHING IN MEDIA. IN THE FUTURE BUDGET. COMMITS TO A SPECIFIC LOCATION SO THE EXPANSION IS. CLEARLY NOT BEING USED BUT CARNEGIE. S. THE CARNEGIE STATE VEHICULAR RECREATION AREA IS. THIRTEEN HUNDRED ACRES OF PROVIDING EIGHTY MILES OF TRAILS YOU'RE CLOSING THAT TOO RIGHT. NO AT CARNEGIE BE OPERATING OUT WHICH WE AREAS OF CARNEGIE WILL NOT BE IMPACTED BY THIS. OKAY SO YOU'RE JUST PRECLUDING THE EXPANSION. YES THAT IS CORRECT OKAY- THAT'S STILL DEBATABLE BUT I I'D- I STILL AM CONCERNED THAT- YOU'RE YOU'RE ACTUALLY CLOSING OFFER REDUCING- RECREATIONAL AREAS BUT IN TERMS OF- SYKORA AT IN THIS RESOURCES BILL THERE'S A SEQUEL EXEMPTION FOR- HABITAT FOR FISH AND WILDLIFE- AND I'M ASSUMING THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE DROUGHT. BUT WHILE THE M. U. S. ADMINISTRATION SUPPORT SEQUEL EXEMPTIONS FOR FISH AND WILDLIFE WHY NOT DO YOU SEE WHAT EXEMPTIONS FOR- FOR WILDFIRE PREVENTION AS WELL. THANKS FOR THE QUESTION TO MY COLLEAGUES OR YOUR REGULAR THANK YOU. YES JUGGLER AGAIN OF THE PART OF FINANCE SO I THINK IN TERMS OF- WILDFIRE FORCES GOING TO HELL THE COMMITTEES I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT THERE IS. A CURRENTLY- CAL BTP IT'S BASICALLY- PROCESS TO STREAMLINE ENVIRONMENTAL- PROCESS EVEN PERMITTING THAT- KIND OF CALIFORNIA HAS WORKED THROUGH THAT BASICALLY% STREAMLINED THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROPERTIES FOR THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT WOULD GET FUNDED- WITH THE PLAN THAT WOULD BRING FORWARD. AND I'M MAKING A TURN OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE I REBEKAH MORKEL PRIOR LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL ON THAT CAL BTP PROPER THAT HOW HOW WE BELIEVE THAT OUR DRESSES- THE KIND OF THE KIND OF YOU KNOW SPEAK WITH TYPE- ACCELERATION. AT AND MAKING SURE THAT THOSE PROJECTS ARE. EXPEDITIOUSLY AND I MOVED QUICKLY. THANK YOU BACK MORE DEPART OF FINANCE.

STREAMLINE THE PEOPLE PROCESS WITH THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT THEY HAVE A PROGRAM PROGRAMMATIC YEAH I ARE IN PLACE THAT NOW ALLOWS. DIFFICULT PROCESS TO BE TAKEN FROM MY USUAL TWO YEARS DOWN TO ABOUT TWO MONTHS AND EVERY PROJECTS BUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT GOES THROUGH THIS. A WILDFIRE FUNDING WILL. BE EVALUATED AS PART OF THAT PROCESS WHICH INCORPORATES FISH AND WILDLIFE- THE STATE WATER BOARD WHICH IS RECEIVING TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO COVER ALL OF THEIR PROGRAMS EACH OF THE NEXT FEW YEARS- WE'RE ALSO TRYING TO INCORPORATE THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS IN WITH THIS FUNDING. AND ESSENTIALLY THAT THE PROCESS COVERS ALL OF THE SPEAK WHAT CONSIDERATION BY. ANY PROJECTS THAT NEED TO GO THROUGH. OKAY CERTAINLY EFFORT WE'VE FROM FOR THAT THAT ENDED THAT SEEK WHAT IS CAN AND CONTINUES TO BE A ROADBLOCK- TO DO THESE VEGETATION MEASURE PROJECTS- ARE YOU HEARING THE SAME THING ARE YOU ARE YOU ARE YOU IS IT YOUR POSITION THAT THIS IS WORKING. THAT IS THAT THE STREAMLINED PROCESS IS WORKING. YES IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS IS ALREADY IN PLACE AND THAT THE VISION WHILE THE BUT I'M ALRIGHT BUT ALREADY AND ALL ALREADY IN PLACES I MEAN IT'S WORKING. IT IS ARE YOU ARE YOU SAYING. THAT THAT THIS PROCESS IS WORKING THAT THAT THE SEQUEL PROCESS IS STREAMLINED TO THE POINT WHERE FORSTER'S ARE HAPPY WITH THE PROCESS. OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT ALL OF THESE PROJECTS THAT ARE BEING PERMITTED ESPECIALLY THROUGH THE EARLY ACTION FUNDING ALREADY EXPERIENCING THAT DESTRY MINAHASA. OKAY SO WE'RE GONNA SEE MORE ACRES BEING TREATED THE NEXT TIME YOU TESTIFIED BEFORE US. AND WE ALSO HAVE PRELIMINARY NINETEEN TWENTY NUMBERS AND ARE WAITING ON TWENTY TWENTY ONE NUMBERS BUT OUR UNDERSTANDING AND BUT OUR AD ACRES TREATED JUMPS QUITE SIGNIFICANTLY LAUGHTER. BECAUSE OF THAT ABOUT. IF THE CHAIRMAN TOLD ME IF I CAN JUMP TO THE L. A. L. IS THE SEQUEL EXEMPTION IS THE SEEK WHAT THE STREAMLINED SECRET PROCESS ISN'T WORKING. GOOD MORNING MR FONG BRYAN BROWN AGAIN WITH THE L. A. O.

SEEK WORK CONTINUES TOBE A ROADBLOCK SO I CERTAINLY WOULD APPRECIATE ANY. DATA OR EVIDENCE THAT SEEK WAS NOT A PROBLEM- IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. I HAVEN'T SEEN UP UP UP UP PROJECT APPROVED IN TWO MONTHS SO THAT SEEMS TO BE A VERY. AGGRESSIVE TIMELINE BUT I CERTAINLY WOULD. WOULD HOPE THAT. MORE PROJECTS TO BE APPROVED IN THAT TIME FRAME- LET'S SEE HERE. IN TERMS OF THE- THERE'S BEEN THIS BILL IN THE RESOURCE BUILT THE BILL ALSO EXPEDITES THE REMOVAL OF HYDROELECTRIC THIS FOR THE HYDROELECTRIC FACILITIES AND DAMS ON THE KLAMATH RIVER. SO IT SEEMS. FRUSTRATING THAT WE'RE EXPEDITING WE'RE NOT EXPEDITING THE CONSTRUCTION OF WATER STORAGE OR WOULD EVEN PUTTING ANY MONEY INTO WATER STORAGE. BUT WE- BUT WE'RE WILLING TO REMOVE FACILITIES AND DAMS IS THAT CORRECT. BUT SIR DR FLOWER BUT PART OF FINANCE- IF I DO MAKE CLEAR BY A LITTLE BIT ON THE CLIMATE THAT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE SO THAT PROCESS THE PROJECT I. P. ALREADY WENT TO SEE WHAT AND- RIGHT NOW IT'S GOING THROUGH- APPROVAL THROUGH THROUGH FOR IT THROUGH THE FEDERAL PROCESS AND THERE ARE CONCERNS THAT BACK ADDITIONAL APPROVAL WITHIN-TRIGGER A SECOND VEHICLE.

AMERICA RIGHT MAC RESCUE PLAN ACT GUIDELINES BUT- THESE DOLLARS ARE AN ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL. THIS THIS IS SO IT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE USED FOR THESE FOR THE FUND. FOR THIS ECONOMIC FUND. KNEES FONG ARE YOU THESE FUNDS ARE PROPOSAL THE MINISTRATION HAS USE. AS PROPOSED TO USE THESE DOLLARS FOR. OKAY SO BUT THERE'S NO STRINGS ATTACHED I GUESS BEFORE AND THE FOR THE FOR GOVERNMENT PROVIDED THIS FUNDS THAT COULD BE USED FOR YOU GUYS CHOSE TO USE IT FOR THIS FUND AS AS I GUESS THAT'S ON MY BIKE. YES THAT IS CORRECT OKAY SO THEN. WHY DOES THAT THIS. PROGRAM WHY DOES IT NOT INVOLVE THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD WHICH YOU WOULD THINK WOULD BE PART OF. THAT WOULD BE PART OF THE MIX IT WOULD BE NEEDED TO BE PART OF THE MIX AND YOU WHY DID YOU LEAVE THEM OUT AND THEN WHY DO YOU PUT THEM INTO THE- WADI OF THE EDT LEAD THIS PROGRAM WHEN I'M NOT SURE THAT ANYONE BELIEVES THAT THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO ACTUALLY DELIVER RESULTS. SO TRY TO ADDRESS THOSE EACH OF THOSE QUESTIONS ANSWERED LIKE THERE'S A COUPLE OF THEM IN THERE AND PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF I SKIP ANYTHING. GIVEN THE FIRST ONE SO THIS ONE IS THIS PROGRAM IS GOING TO BE THE **** BOOKKEEPING ROLE THIS IS GOING TO BE HANDLED BY THE E. WORKFORCE. SERVICES BRANCH. WHICH IS UNRELATED TO EDIE'S CORPORATIONS OF YOU WHY THE I. LIKE THE UNIVERSE- THOSE- REGULARLY THE WORKFORCE SERVICES BRANCH HAS ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED EMPLOYEES AND MANAGES HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND WORKFORCE INNOVATION AND OPPORTUNITY ACT A REAL FUNDING SO WE BELIEVE THERE ARE MORE THAN CAPABLE OF ADMINISTERING YEAH PAPERWORK FOR THIS FUN ASIDE FROM THAT- INTERAGENCY LEADER TEAM OF LABOR AGENCY GOV IS AN OPR WILL BE- AND RESPONSIBLE FOR THE POLICY DEVELOPMENT RELATED. AS FOR THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD- I THINK THIS IS GOING TO MAKE THIS IS NOT. A WORK FORCE TRAINING PROPOSAL IS AN ECONOMIC RECOVERY PROPOSAL AND THEREFORE WORK FIRST BOARD WILL CERTAINLY- LABOUR NEC MEMBER LIE ON THEM. FOR INFORMATION ABOUT SOME OF THE PROGRAMS IN THEIR REQUIREMENTS TO BANK WITH WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD PROGRAMS WHERE AFTER APPLICABLE. BUT IT IS NOT REALLY UNDER THEIR PURVIEW. OKAY SO THEN WHO DETERMINES. HI I THINK THE PHRASE IS DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY CODED THAT DID THAT THE FUNDS WOULD GO TO THESE REGIONS SO WHO WHO'S WHO DETERMINES WHERE THE FUNDS GO. SURE THE PHRASE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY CLIMATE NINETEEN IS DEFINED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND IS INCLUDED HERE TO ALIGN WITH AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT ENDS. OF THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ADMINISTRATION RELEASED A NOTICE OF FUNDING AVAILABILITY DETERMINE EVERY REGION IN THE U. S. HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY KOGAN AND- PROVE ON THIS TOPIC WILL BE REFLECTED IN THE ART AND ARCADE PROCESS. SAID THAT THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE RELIEF BUT- THE READING OF AT LEAST THE READING OF THE LANGUAGE ALLOWS- THE BAG ALLOWS THE RECIPIENT TO HAVE FIVE YEARS TO EXPAND THE FUNDS IS THAT CORRECT. CORRECT YEAH THESE- THIS TIME LINE HERE THE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY SIX STATES ARE THERE TO ALIGN WITH FEDERAL ARE BUYING CONFERENCE- ASIDE FROM ALLOWING GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION- ALIGNING WITH THIS FINAL GUNS- ALLOWED THE REGIONS THAT HAVE THE MOST FLEXIBILITY TO PLAN FOR THEIR ECONOMIC THAT. NEEDS FROM THE- TO RECOVER FROM THE PANDEMIC OKAY. I WOULD JUST WOULD JUST SAY THAT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE SIX ARE MILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE THAT AND IF THAT THE AND THE GOAL IS IMMEDIATE ECONOMIC RECOVERY I THINK THERE ARE PROBABLY OTHER THINGS TO DO I WOULD SAY MAYBE- RESTORING SOME OF THE TAX CREDITS AND RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT MAYBE YOU. BEEN DOING IT VIA NET OPERATING LOSS DEDUCTION DEDUCTIONS THAT WERE TAKEN AWAY LET THE LAST- BUDGET I FEEL LIKE THOSE THINGS IT PROVIDES A MORE IMMEDIATE RELIEF- DAN THANK CREATING A WHOLE NEW- GRANT PROGRAMS- AND- TOOK THE JOB. TO A- THAT'S THE. ONE SIXTY- CERTAINLY THE TO THE BERMAN FINDS THE REMOVAL OF FIREARMS FROM CONVICTED FELONS AND OTHER PROHIBITED PERSONS- YOU WILL NOW HAVE STRUGGLED TO STAFFING ISSUES- AND AT THE CURRENT ATTORNEY GENERAL IS TRYING TO CHANGE THAT HAS. THAT BARGAINING UNIT APPROACHED. THE ADMINISTRATION TO INCREASE THE SALARIES OF THOSE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. YES CAN I TURN THAT QUESTION TOO MERRY ALTERMAN WHO WORKS IN OUR COMPENSATION AND THANK YOU. I AM VERY WELL TRAINED DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SO FOR I'M THE DOJ FIVE BATTERY BY SPECIFICALLY FOR THE SPECIAL AGENTS- IF THERE ARE ANY PENDING REQUESTS ON OTHER ITEMS WE DON'T DISCLOSE THAT INFORMATION- UNTIL WE'VE ACTUALLY REACHED AN AGREEMENT. BUT I GUESS E. THERE IS A KNOWLEDGE MEANT THAT THERE IS SIGNIFICANT STAFFING ISSUES WITH THIS WITH THE PROGRAM. WHEN I AM NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT PROGRAM AND SO I MAY HAVE TO TURN IT OVER TO ANOTHER COLLEAGUE HAS THE ASSIGNMENT. DOES ANYONE ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR STAFFING ISSUES OR IS THAT. IS THAT NOT AN ISSUE FOR THE MINISTRATION. SORRY THIS IS AMY JARVIS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND I AGREE WITH THIS WHOLE TIME AND THAT WE ARE UNABLE TO DISCLOSE ANYTHING RELATED TO THE BARGAINING PROCESS BUT WE ARE AWARE. OF AND SOME ISSUES WITH THEIR ABILITY TO HIRE AND RETAIN AND THOSE CLASSIFICATIONS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND CONVERSATIONS WILL BE ONGOING OKAY I MEAN CERTAINLY I I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO DIVULGE. SENSITIVE INFORMATION I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WAS WAS- COGNIZANT OF THIS AND THAT THEY WERE- THERE WAS ON I WAS ON YOUR RADAR SO I APPRECIATE THAT- JUMPING TO THE EDUCATION TRAILER- SB ONE SIXTY SEVEN- I KNOW THIS IS AN AREA THAT'S THAT'S VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO THE CHAIRS- HEART BUT IN TERMS OF THE INDEPENDENT STUDY. WHAT WAS THE IMPETUS FOR THESE CHANGES INDEPENDENT STUDY WHAT WAS IT WAS THE- AS THE PRICE IS NOT WORKING WAS IT IS IT IS WHAT IS NECESSARY BECAUSEOF. OF THINGS THAT WERE HAPPENING WITHIN DIFFERENT SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN YOU JUST GIVE ME KIND OF A SENSE OF WHY THAT WHY THESE CHANGES WERE NECESSARY. CHARLTON THE QUESTION TO JUST A COUPLE. WE JUST GOT HOMES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE MAJOR CHANGES THAT WERE MADE IN SB ONE SIXTY SEVEN ARE REFLECTIVE AND INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE COLLECTED THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER AFTER THAT. ENACTMENT OF THE ORIGINAL HONEST TRAILER BILL THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND EDUCATION HONEST TRAILER BILL. AND IT WAS NEVER THE INTENT OF THE ADMINISTRATION- TO NOT PROVIDE APPORTIONMENT TO AND LEDS ARE PROVIDING INDEPENDENT STUDY STUDENTS WHO WERE QUARANTINED- NOTED TO IT TOO TO NOT PROVIDE THEM WITH THE FORTUNATE FOR THAT- AND SO THAT THE MAJOR CHANGE IN THIS BILL WOULD ENSURE THAT WHEN A LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCY IS PROVIDING THAT INDEPENDENT STUDY TO THAT QUARANTINE STUDENT THEY CAN RECEIVE THAT APARTMENT- THIS IS REALLY CONNECTED TO- I THINK WITH. A SHARED PRIORITY AMONG THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION THAT STUDENTS ARE RECEIVING A CONTINUITY CONSTRUCTION EVEN WHILE THEY'RE QUARANTINED- AS OPPOSED TO YOU KNOW GOING HOME AND NOT YOU KNOW HAVING ANY KIND OF INSTRUCTION MOTHER IN QUARANTINE- THERE SOME ADDITIONAL CHANGES THAT WERE MADE- SPECIFICALLY AROUND EXTENDING- SUBSTITUTE TEACHER- AT THE ABILITY FOR SUCH A TEACHER TO TEACH IN A SINGLE CLASSROOM FROM THIRTY DAYS TO SIXTY DAYS IN RECOGNITION BALK- HER EXPERIENCING A- SHORTAGE THROUGHOUT THE STATE- AS WELL AS SOME OTHER. TECHNICAL CHANGES- BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE ON ON THE SO I GUESS THAT TO JUMP INTO THE SPECIFIC THERE'S LIMITATIONS TO THAT TO THE G. J. THIRTEEN PROCESS WRITINGS EIGHT THAT THAT'S CLEARLY OUTLINED WHICH ALLOWS- SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO- TELL ASK REFLECTS. DO TO A NORMALLY ITS USE FOR- NETTED DISASTERS OTHER THINGS RIGHT WAS THE J. THIRTEEN PROCESS NOT WORKING TO THE POINT WHERE YOU NEED TO MAKE THESE CHANGES YOU WOULD THINK THAT. A PANDEMIC WOULD ALSO BE A REASON WHY SCHOOL DISTRICTS WE USED TO DATE THIRTEEN PROCESS. CERTAINLY SO- THE REASON WHY WE MADE THAT CHANGE WAS LESS ABOUT- SOMETHING NOT WORKING A MORE ABOUT PROVIDING CLARITY. AND TO THE EDUCATION FIELD- AND THEN ALSO INSURING THAT WE'RE NOT DISINCENTIVE FIGHTING THE PRODUCTION OF INDEPENDENT STUDY SOME KIND OF. INSTRUCTIONAL CONTINUITY WHILE STUDENTS ARE I'M CURRENTLY IN FOR COVE IT SO IN THAT THE G. THIRTEEN A PROCESS FOR THOSE WHO ARE UNFAMILIAR IS- L. I. IT AWAY THAT- SCHOOLS CAN. RE CAPTURE AN AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE THAT'S LOST DURING TIMES OF EMERGENCY- SCHOOLS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO. PROVIDE ANY SORT OF INSTRUCTION IN ORDER TO RECAP FOR THE EIGHTY EIGHT JUST- SIMPLY TO IDENTIFY THAT THERE IS AN EMERGENCY. SO THE PURPOSE OF THE CHANGES THERE WAS TO CLARIFY THAT THE G. THIRTEEN EIGHTY- IS NOT APPROPRIATE IN. THE CASE OF KOPET- QUARANTINE BECAUSE THE STATE IS GIVING A LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES THE ABILITY TO EARN. THAT INDEPENDENT STUDY CREDIT THE EIGHTY EIGHT THROUGH INDEPENDENT STUDY- ED. AS A SPECIFIED AND THE OTHER SECTIONS OF THIS BILL SB ONE SIXTY SEVEN. SO SCHOOLS DON'T HAVE SCHOOLS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO EARN THAT CREDIT- REGARDLESS OF. THE G. THIRTEEN PROCESS THAT'S CLARIFYING THAT THAT'S NOT AN APPROPRIATE PATH FOR SCHOOLS TO TAKE ALSO ENSURING THAT SCHOOLS ARE AREN'T INCENTIVIZED TO. TRY TO GO DOWN THAT PATH- AND NOT PROVIDE SERVICES INSTRUCTIONAL CONTINUITY TO STUDENTS WHILE THEY'RE QUARANTINED. OKAY- SO IT ONE OF THE ONE THE- EXEMPTION IS A COURSE WHEN THERE'S A TEACHER SHORTAGE BUT THAT DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU- CLASSIFIED STAFF AS WELL THERE'S A SHORTENED CLASS STORAGE OF CLASSIFIED STAFF- I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE THAT. SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE A HUGE SHORTAGE OF BUS DRIVERS WHICH CERTAINLY AFFECTS A LOT OF STUDENTS BUT SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS SPECIFICALLY SO. WOOD THIS BILL ALLOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS- TO USE THIS PROCESS TO GET TO FOR ASSISTANCE AND FORGET CLASSIFIED STEP BACK TO THE SCHOOLS. YES AND CERTAINLY AND SAID THAT THE I BELIEVE THE LANGUAGE THAT WE USE TO REFER TO STAFF SO SCHOOL STAFF AS OPPOSED TO JUST CERTIFICATED STAFFERS ARE TEACHERS- YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE BEEN I I'VE BEEN PRIVY TO SOME MEETINGS THAT- ARE IRAN. AT PARTNERS OVER THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION HAVE BEEN HAVING WITH MANY COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS SUPERINTENDENTS- AND THAT THERE'S BEEN QUITE A LOT OF CONVERSATION AROUND THE STAFFING ISSUES THAT ALLEYS ARE HAVING AND YOU'RE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT- YOU KNOW THERE ARE SPECIFIC SPECIFICALLY IN SPECIAL EDUCATION. THERE ARE SOME REAL AND THAT THE SHORTAGES THAT WERE ALREADY THERE BEEN EXACERBATED- AND SO I KNOW THAT THE STATE BOARD OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAVE BEEN DOING A LOT OF GREAT WORK TRYING TO HELP FOLKS WORK THROUGH. ON SOME OF THESE DIFFICULTIES AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE AWARE OF ALL THE RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM I'M CONNECTING THEM WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S ANYTHING THAT'S NEEDED AROUND YOU ALONG THE LINES OF TESTING. ON OUR CONTACT RAISING THAT RESOURCES CAN BE PROVIDED- AND SO WE'RE WE'RE VERY AWARE OF THAT ISSUE IN AND MADE A VERY CONSCIOUS DECISION TO- HAVE THAT. THE ABILITY TO CALL THAT WAIVER APPLY TO ALL STAFF NOT JUST TEACHERS OKAY APPRECIATE THAT I'D CERTAINLY IF YOU KEEP US UPDATED I KNOW THAT- OUR SUPERINTENDENTS AND OUR PRINCIPALS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE- THE SHORTAGES ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES THE BUS DRIVERS TRANSPORTATION IS CERTAINLY A BIG DEAL- BUT ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS- LIKE KERN. JUMPING TO- SB EIGHT ONE SIXTY NINE- CAN SOMEONE PROVIDE SOME. BACKGROUND IN TERMS OF- THE PROHIBITION ON PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS ON. ON UNIVERSITY HOUSING WHY THAT WHY THAT'S THERE. MIGHT AS AS A SERI. YEAH I WILL TURN UP QUESTION TO REBECCA- KIRK THANK YOU. REBECCA CURTAINS APARTMENT OF FINANCE. REGARDING YOUR QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT PROHIBITION IT IS INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT STATE FUNDS SUPPORTING THE STUDENT HOUSING PROJECTS THE THAT PROGRAM WOULD BE USED TO SUPPORT THE PUBLIC INTEREST AND WE WOULD KNOW THAT THE PROHIBITION DOES NOT PRECLUDE THE SEGMENTS FROM ENTERING INTO PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER PUBLIC ENTITIES OR WITH NONPROFIT ENTITIES. OKAY SO IT'S ONLY. IT'S ONLY PROHIBITS THIS FUND FROM BEING USED FOR PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS NOT IT DOESN'T PREVENT UNIVERSITIES TO- CALIFORNIA VERSUS TO ENTER INTO- PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS FOR HOUSING BROADLY. THAT IS CORRECT THE PROHIBITION IS SPECIFIC TO PROJECTS FUNDED WITH THE STUDENT HOUSING GRANT PROGRAM BEING ESTABLISHED IN THE TRAILER BILL. BUT I GUESS I GUESS GOING BACK TO THE- GUESS THE DIRECTIONAL THRUST OF THE QUESTION WHY WOULD WE WANT TO PREVENT. THE USE OF STATE THE STATE FUNDS IF THERE'S A IF THERE'S A GOOD PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP WHY WOULD WE WANT TO PREVENT THAT. I WOULD SAY THAT. THE INTENT IS JUST TO KEEP FOCUSED KEEP THOSE PROBLEMS FOCUSED ON SUPPORTING PUBLIC ENTITIES OR A NONPROFIT AGREEMENTS THAT THE SEGMENTS MAY ENTER INTO PUBLIC- INTO PARTNERSHIP WITH. AND FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON OF MY COLLEAGUES AT THE L. A. L. OR. THE LEGISLATIVE SIDE HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD. CHRIS FERGUSON WITH FINANCE AYE I WOULD ADD ONE OTHER ADDITIONAL NOTED THAT IS UNDER THE GRANT PROGRAM THE EXPECTATION IS THAT THE STATE IS SUPPORTING THE COST TO CONSTRUCT THE FACILITIES AND UNDER THAT APPROACH IF WE'RE PAYING FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THAT FACILITY IT IS IT IS IN THE IN THE INTEREST OF UNIVERSITIES THAT THEY MAIN CONTROL OF THAT FACILITY. OKAY. I GUESS I GUESS MY CONCERN IS PROHIBITING SOMETHING THAT COULD BE A GOOD THING IT'S IT SEEMS- KAREN TO IT OF BUT- JUMPING TO. THE BUDGET BILL JUNIOR- WERE FROM THE FIVE POINT OUR HIGHER ON THE BUDGET BUDGET HAD MISTER CHAIR. OF IN TERMS OF- MINUS THAT SO IN IN THIS IN THIS BILL THERE'S A DO YOU INDICATED THERE'S NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS ALLOCATED- TO WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND THAT'S SO THAT FUNDING IS ALL DEDICATED TO ONE OF OUR PREVENTION RIGHT IT CAN'T GO TO OTHER THINGS I'M NOTICING OTHER PROVISIONS THAT SAY. THAT WILDFIRE PREVENTION IS ELIGIBLE FOR THOSE FINDINGS BUT THEN THERE'S OTHER THINGS. THAT ARE ASSOCIATED OTHER USES THAT ARE NOT WILDFIRE PREVENTION SPECIFIC SO I GUESS THAT MY QUESTION IS ARE YOU COUNTING THOSE THAT OR ARE YOU ARE OR HOWEVER THESE DEDICATED TO OF OUR PREVENTION. YES THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER THERE IS. INDEED THE NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION OR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FOR ADDITIONAL WILDFIRE FORCED RESILIENCE INVESTMENTS AND I'LL TURN THE- THAT MORE DETAILED ANSWER OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES AND YOU KNOW I GET LARA OR- THE PROJECT THAT WOULD FALL UNDER THAT. YES THEIR GENERAL FUND FINANCED YEAH THIS NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION WHICH OF IN ADDITION TO THAT EARLY ACTION A FIVE THIRTY FOUR FOR A TOTAL OF ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IS ALL FOR. WILDFIRE PREVENTION OF FOREST RESILIENCE EFFORTS SO FUNDING TO HELP CREATE RESILIENT WILDLANDS- TO DO FUEL BREAKS- COMEDIAN HARDENING. UP MORE SCIENCE BASED MANAGEMENT AND STREAMLINE THE PERMITTING WHICH WE WERE DISCUSSING A LITTLE BIT EARLIER- MORE KIND OF CLIMATE RESILIENT ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR THE FLOOR SECTOR- WORKFORCE WORTH FOR SECTOR. AND SO ALL OF THIS WHOLE PACKAGE- BASICALLY ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TOTAL WHEN YOU COMBINE THE EARLY ACTION PUT THE NINE EIGHTY EIGHT. IS ALL FOR WALTER. PREVENTION FORCES DOING OKAY. IN IN TERMS OF THE- I KNOW THAT THERE'S A REAL WE- IN THIS IN THIS TRAILER BILL BUT- WHAT ENTITY IS. IS TASKED TO OVERSEE. ALL THIS FUNDING AND WHETHER IT'S WORKING IS IT IS IT IS IT SOMEONE WITH AND CAL FIRE IS IT SOMEONE WITHIN DEPARTMENT FINANCE IS IT SOMEONE WITHIN THAT RESOURCES ARE WHO IS OR WHO OR WHAT ENTITY IS TASKED. TO TRACK ALL THIS FUNDING AND TO TRACK THE METRICS OF WHAT'S BEING USED FOR. I BELIEVE UNDER THE TRAILER BILL IT IDENTIFIED AS THE NATURALRESOURCE AGENCY WHO WOULD TRACK AND MONITOR OR WHO WOULD COLLECT THE INFORMATION I THINK THAT'S- HOW THE KIND OF ENTITY THAT WE FRAMED AS AS THE- ENTITY THAT WOULD GATHER THE INFORMATION TO THEM TO THE ANNUAL REPORTING. THAT WE'RE PUTTING INTO THE TRAILER BILL BUT AGAIN LIKE FOR EVERY INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS- WARD MINISTERING THE PROGRAMMED AND SO EVERY DEPARTMENTS ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN PROGRAMS BUT IT'S CAUGHT FIRE WAS PART OF THAT FISH AND WILDLIFE COULDN'T EVERYBODY HAS. GOT DIFFERENT PIZZA THAT THE LARGER PUZZLE- I THINK IN TERMS OF THE KIND OF OLD- REPORTING IT WOULD BE THAT NECTARIES AGENCY AS- THE LEAD OVER I THINK THE MAJORITY THE DEPARTMENT. THIS FUNDING THAT WOULD GATHER THIS INFORMATION TO DO THAT MORNING. I HAD I APPRECIATE THAT THERE ARE A LOT AGENCIES INVOLVED I THINK THAT THAT'S THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE AND MAYBE THAT SOME OF THE MEMBERS THAT REPRESENT AREAS THAT ARE ON THAT ARE ON FIRE RIGHT NOW IS THAT. THAT COORDINATION IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THINGS ARE BEING DONE AND SO WE DON'T WANT THE LEFT HANDED NOT NOT KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT HAND IS DOING. SO. AND THAT I THINK THAT'S WHY- HAVING AN- OR SOME. TASKED WITH TRACKING ALL THIS AND COORDINATING IT SO THAT THERE AREN'T ANY BLIND SPOTS. ASSEMBLY THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTAT TO ME THAT WE WOULD ASK FOR- MOVING FORWARD- I KNOW I AM- I'M GONNA GOING BACK TO DROUGHT AND WATER STORAGE BUT- CAN I ASK ADMINISTRATION WHAT IS THE STICKING POINT. FOR YOU ALL IN TERMS OF WHY. THERE ISN'T MORE OF A DESIRE FOR WATER STORAGE IS THERE SOMETHING SPECIFIC THAT YOU GUYS DON'T WANT. OR WHAT WHAT IS WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE PREDICT WHAT'S THE SPECIFIC STICKING POINT. SO I'M NOT TRACKING ANY PARTICULAR STICKING POINT OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT THERE'S TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS THAT IS GOING TO BE GOING OUT FOR THE SEVEN LARGE PROJECTS THAT ARE ARE GONNA BE IMPLEMENTED OVER THE- NEXT FEW YEARS YOU KNOW THAT ARE CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH THE APPROVAL PROCESS. TO GIVE THAT THERE'S AB TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS BILLION DOLLARS THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT NEEDS AND THE WATERS BASED ON DEMONSTRATION PUT OUT- IN TWENTY TWENTY THE WATER IS GOING PORTFOLIO WHICH BASICALLY HAVE A PORTFOLIO STRATEGIES- TO BUILD UP MORE RESILIENCE IN OUR IN OUR WATER SYSTEM WORKING WITH LOCALS AND- AND PARTNERSHIPS AND SO- YOU JUST ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THERE'S A LOT OF. DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT THEY HAVE A NEED AND THERE'S ALREADY TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS THAT IS- SET ASIDE FOR WATER STORAGE THOUGH- I DON'T THINK ANY PARTICULAR STICKING POINT HAVE O WHY. WHY NOT MORE OTHER THAN A TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION THAT IS CURRENTLY SET UP SO LET ME COMPARE MY LIST WITH YOUR LIST WHAT I THE SEVEN PROJECTS THAT YOU HAVE PENDING BEFORE. THE WATER COMMISSION. SO THE CHINO BASIN USED ENVIRONMENTAL STORAGE THE HARDEST WATER PROGRAM. THE KERN- BROADER WATER STORAGE PROGRAM THE LOCALES RATHER FOR THE CHECK A RATHER WARM SITES RESERVOIR AND WILLOW SPRINGS. SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT AFTER THE TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IS ALLOCATED ASSUMING IT HAPPENS- THAT THESE SEVEN PROJECTS ARE GOING TO BECOME FULLY COMPLETED OPERATIONAL. IF THEY RECEIVE ALL THE APPROPRIATE APPROVALS AND THE- OTHER FINANCING MECHANISMS WHICH IS PART OF ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS THERE AND I MEAN AT LEAST WE COULD SAY IS THE TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IS WOULD BE SET ASIDE FOR THE PROJECT. BUT AGAIN THESE ARE NOT YOU KNOW STATE RUN PROJECTS THE WOULD BE RUN BY THE LOCAL WATER DISTRICTS AS- ULTIMATELY YOU KNOW THE PIECE DOES DEPEND ON ON THE SPEED OF THESE LOCAL IMPLEMENTERS TO GET THE PROJECT DONE AS A WE CAN ACTUALLY SPEAK ON. ON BEHALF OF- KIND OF THE FEEDER OR WHETHER THE KIND OF LOCAL WILL WILL GET IT DONE BUT THESE ARE LOCALLY RUN PROJECTS. WITH A UV GOT A COULD YOU WOULD ON DAHLE THOUGH THAT FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE- CONVEYANCE FACILITIES AND OTHER PROJECTS THAT ALSO NEED TO BE DONE TO HELP MOVE THE WATER AROUND I MEAN I GUESS MY I GUESS I'M HARPING ON THIS BECAUSE THIS IS. THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE FACING THE CENTRAL VALLEY- YOU KNOW I DRIVE THE FIVE NINE NINE I DID I DID IT YESTERDAY. I MEAN IT'S- THERE'S DEVASTATION HAPPENING. ALONG IN THERE IN THE CENTER VALLEY- TREES ARE BEING UPROOTED THERE'S JUST IT'S JUST. IT'S A VERY DEPRESSING DR WHEN YOU SEE THAT THAT THE DEVASTATION OF THIS DROUGHT. AND SO I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND IF YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT IS STILL STICKING POINTS BETWEEN WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OVER AROUND. CONVENIENCE AND WATER STORAGE. THERE HAS TO BE BECAUSE YOU CLEARLY ARE NOT INVESTING ANY MONEY IN THIS BUDGET FOR THAT. THE BUDGET DOES INCLUDE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR A CONVEYANCE AND IF I COULD SPEAK TO A LITTLE BIT TO OTHER PROGRAMS THAT ALSO THE FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHICH- YOU KNOW WE'RE PUTTING A LOT OF FUNDING INTO SIGMA AND HIS BUDGET. WHICH WE KNOW YOU KNOW- THAT CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASED IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY- ARE ARE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED- MORE FUNDING FOR A WATER RECYCLING WHICH PROVIDES A GREATER SO A PLAN RIGHT WILL THE LIABILITY OF WATER- OPERA GROUNDWATER CLEANUP WHICH WE KNOW IS ALSO AN ISSUE ACROSS THE STATE AND ALSO IN THE- CENTRAL VALLEY THERE'S- IMMEDIATE ROUTE SUPPORT THAT WE'RE DOING FOR THOSE. COUNTIES VISITED ME PRIMARILY TO THAT ARE IMPACTED BY DROUGHT WHICH WE KNOW MANY ARE IN CENTRAL VALLEY AND SO I WOULD SAY THIS BUDGET AS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT- SUPPORT- GROWL AND THOSE COMMUNITIES MOST IN NEED- IN ADDITION TO COMMANDS WHICH IS WHAT YOU'RE A TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. SO OKAY IS A I MEAN. YOU HAVE TO A MILLION DOLLARS IN COMMANDS I GUESS THIS IS NOT GOING TO CONVINCE FOR THE MOMENT. A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS YEAR A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AS PROMISED HOPEFULLY PINKY SWEAR NEXT YEAR- BUT THERE'S SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF WORK ON THE COMES A CONVEYANCE. SO YOU DON'T EVEN FINISH THE CONVEYANCE WORK. YES A PART OF THE BILL LANGUAGE OUT WITH APPROVED IN THE BY JOHN CONVENIENCE. WILL ALSO SPEAKING TO A NON STATE COST SHARE AND ALSO DEPENDING ON THE PROJECTS SOME OF THEM ARE ARE FEDERALLY RUN PROJECTS AND SO. ATTENTION WE HAVING YOU KNOW A FEDERAL MATCH WHERE THAT WOULD KICK IN ORDER- LOCAL MATCH. AS THOUGH YOU KNOW THIS WE BELIEVE THAT A PARTNERSHIP. WITH THE LOCAL FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT YOU KNOW THE STATE OF PUTTING FORWARD- SOME SOME BINDING AND HEAR PENDING ADDITIONAL DISCUSSIONS. MISTER BERTRAM MASTER YEAH I APOLOGIZE I I'LL DO THAT ONE LAST QUESTION AND NOW JUMPED TO- I'VE I APPRECIATE THE BACK AND FORTH A LAST QUESTION WHEN IT COMES. WILL JUMP INTO SB ONE SEVENTY THREE AND APPRECIATE THE CHAIRS PATIENTS- JUMPING THROUGH IS A LOT OF- A LOT OF CONTENT IN THIS AND THIS AND THESE FIFTEEN SIXTEEN TO THE BILLS- IN TERMS OF THE- THE- THE PROVISIONS TO.

NUMBER SORRY ABOUT THE NAME. HI I WAS ACTUALLY REBEKAH MORIN L- TURN IT OVER TO HOLD. POLICY ABOUT ONE YEARBACK IN OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YEAH ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING. OKAY SO BUT SOME PROJECTS ARE TAKING TWO MONTHS SOME PROJECTS ARE STILL TAKING TWO YEARS IS THERE ANY PROJECTS WENT FOR STREET THAT. IS TAKING TOO MUCH DO YOU HAVE A. LISTER CAN YOU SEND US A LIST OF FORESTRY PROJECTS THAT I'VE DONE THROUGH THE SEQUEL. IN TWO MONTHS- I'M NOT SURE WE HAVE THAT- IN READILY AVAILABLE AND I DON'T BELIEVE ANY ARE TAKING TWO YEARS WE JUST PUSHED OUT REALLY ACTION DOLLARS. AND ALL OF THOSE PROJECTS ARE IN PROCESS OR ON THE GROUND SO NONE OF THOSE WERE TAKEN. OVER TWO MONTHS OKAY BUT CAN YOU SEND MSELF FOR THE WHOLE COMMITTEE A LIST OF THOSE PROJECTS THAT ARE GETTING PUSHED OUT. THROUGH THAT EARLY ACTION MONEY. SO WE CAN SEE WHAT IS GOING ON WE CAN TRACK IT OR YOU CAN LET US KNOW. THIS PROJECT TOOK FOUR MONTHS TO GET THE SEQUEL AND IT'S UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND WE KNOW WHERE TO FOLLOW THROUGH THAT LINE. AS PART OF THE TRAILER BILL- WE ARE. WE ARE COMMITTING TO A REPORT BY APRIL FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND THAT WILL CONTAIN ALL THAT INFORMATION. OKAY AND NOT MOVE MY VICE CHAIR THANK YOU FOR ALL THE QUESTIONS IN REGARDS TO THE HYDROELECTRIC WATER STORAGE. I'D LIKE TO GO TO THE GENTLEMAN THAT DID THAT FOR THE PROJECTS. TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS FOR SEVEN PROJECTS- THE BOND ONE OF BONDING MONEY. RIGHT NOW WITH THE PART OF FINANCE YEAH IN pONE BOND AND THERE WAS TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS- WHICH IS THERE TO BE CONDITIONAL WORKS TO SEVEN PROJECTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH THE APPROVAL PROCESS IS- BEFORE THE WATER CONDITIONS YEAH BUT FROM TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN TO NOW IT'S BEEN SEVEN YEARS HOW LONG DO WE EXPECTED TO BE FOR. ANY ONE OF THOSE SEVEN PROJECTS GETTING DONE HI YOU REFER TO WILL BE A LOCAL CONTROL THIS IS A STATE WATER PROJECT MY UNDERSTANDING THE STATE IS IN CONTROLOF THE SITES RESERVOIR OR CONVEYANCE PROJECTS WHAT IS THE HOLD UP FOR THE STATE NOT TO FINISH THESE PROJECTS AND HOW MUCH LONGER DO WE HAVE TO WAIT. RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA FOR- WATER CONVEYANCE OF WATER STORAGE SO I WANT FINANCED INTO THE QUESTION DID I THANK THE QUESTIONS TO REMAIN FOCUSED ON THE BUDGET BILLS THAT IN FRONT OF US.

OKAY CONVERSATION THAT THEY CAN FOLLOW UP WITH ME YOU CAN LOOK AT. IF WE COULD NOT BE ABLE TO. SO AGAIN. WELL IT'S A QUESTION AND THEN WE CAN ABSOLUTELY HAVE. FOLLOW UP DOWN THE ROAD. PLACES OPENING. YET WHAT TO FOLLOW UP ON FIVE RATHER OF THE WE HAVE ANY IDEA. KIND OF TIME LINE ON ON THAT ONE. WE GET TO YOU THANK YOU CAN I ASK TRANSPORTATION QUESTION. YOU COULD YOU GO THE QUESTION WANT TO DROP SO YOU CAN ASK ME QUESTIONS SB SEVENTY AND WE'RE TO THE TRI. WHAT IS GOING TO THE COULD PER.

THE PRIORITY TRANSPORTATION FOUGHT. PROJECTS INCLUDING HIGH SPEED RAIL ARE ONGOING WE EXPECT THERE TO BE ON FOR THEIR ACTION AS PART OF EARLY ACTION SOMETIME- IN THE EARLY NEXT YEAR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THEY CAN JUST BROKE GROUND ON THIS REVERSING THE MISTER GALLAGHER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I WANT TO FOCUS MY COMMENTS ON AB ONE FIFTY FIVE THE RESOURCES BILL- BUT FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK OUR CHAIR CHAIR TEEING AND- ARE BUDGET SUB CHAIR- RICHARD BLOOM FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL- WHILE I'M EXCITED ON SOME OF THE ITEMS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THIS BILL- I HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS ON SOME THAT I FEEL. ARE ARE AVOIDING- THE NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE POLICY PROCESS OF FOR EXAMPLE THE SEQUEL EXEMPTIONS AND THE FUEL CELL- NET ENERGY METERING TARAF- THE SEQUEL EXEMPTION. OF FOR HABITAT CONSERVE THEIR THIRTY EXIST A SEQUENCE ACTION FOR HABITAT CONSERVATION PROJECTS WITH APPROPRIATE SAFEGUARDS TO AVOID NEGATIVE IMPACTS AND THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT SEQUEL HAS BEEN AN IMPEDIMENT TO WELL PLANNED LEGITIMATE HABITAT PROJECTS. THIS EXEMPTION IN THIS BILL WILL ALLOW LARGE PRIVATE HABITAT PROJECTS TO AVOID THE THOROUGH PUBLIC REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AS WELL AS TRIBAL CONSULTATION- WITH THE FUEL CELL TWO YEAR EXTENSION. THERE IS IT I THINK IT UNDERMINES THE PAST PAT PRACTICE OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE. TO EVALUATE A MISSION PERFORMANCE EACH TIME THAT THIS PROGRAM IS EXTENDED- THERE ARE WELL KNOWN PROBLEMS WITH VERIFICATION OF THE UEL CELL EMISSIONS PERFORMANCE- AND RIGHT NOW THIS EXTENSION- IS IGNORING A OUR BASE FAILURE TO COLLECT FUEL CELL EMISSIONS DATA. AS PROMISED I HOPE THAT NEXT YEAR WE CAN WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS- AND TO WORK THROUGH SOME OF THESE ISSUES THAT I BELIEVE ARE ARE PUT IN HERE. TO AVOID OUR POLICY COMMITTEE PROCESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR GALLAGHER THEM GONNA MISTER. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN I WANT TO BEGIN I'M NOT NOT SURE WHO TO THANK BUT I DO WANT TO THANK WHOEVER WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR PUTTING IN THE CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION OF THE WILDFIRE FUNDING- FOR AN ADDITIONAL FIVE YEARS- WHOEVER WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT- NOT SURE WHAT WHO WHO THAT WAS BUT- IN THE NEGOTIATIONS LOOKS LIKE THAT'S WHAT CAME OUT HERE OBVIOUSLY THAT'S SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN ASKING FOR ALL YEAR- AND- VERY MUCH SHOULD BE. THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY. IN OUR BUDGET SO THANKFUL FOR THAT HAVE BEEN INCLUDED- I WANT JUST GO INTO THE SEQUEL ISSUE AS WELL- I KIND OF HEARD EARLIER THE ANSWER TO MR FONG'S QUESTION THAT SEEK WAS IS WORKING FINE ON THESE PROJECTS. THAT SEEMS TO BELIE THE TESTIMONY THAT WE'VE HEARD- IN COMMITTEES AND ALSO OUR WILDFIRE SUMMIT THAT WE HOLD HELD LAST WEEK WHERE SEVERAL. IN A FIRE SAFE COUNCILS AND OTHER GROUPS TESTIFIED THAT THAT IS ACTUALLY THE- SEQUEL HAS BEEN AN IMPEDIMENT TO MOVING PROJECTS QUICKLY. URGENT PROJECTS STE AND SO I GUESS MY QUESTION ABOUT THE- F. AND BUDGET STAFF WANTS TO ANSWER IT. WHY NOT WHY NOT STREAMLINED THESE PROJECTS LIKE WE DID THE THIRTY FIVE PRIORITY PROJECTS. THIS IS AN UNPRECEDENTED WE'VE DONE THIS BEFORE WE DID THIRTY FIVE PROJECTS STREAMLINED SYKORA. ROSS SAYS WHY NOT DO THAT AGAIN FOR ADDITIONAL PRIORITY PROJECTS IN THIS BUDGET. PLUS GALLAGHER OR- TURNING TO MY COLLEAGUES I JUST WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT- IN MINISTRATION FOUNDED IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE THAT FIVE YEAR CONTINUES APPROPRIATIONS FOR A WILDFIRE- IN IN REGARDS TO SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO TURN THAT OVER TO YOU- ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES- BELIEVER BACK OF OUR- I THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER ADD TO THAT QUESTION. AS I SAID BEFORE IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS SEQUEL PROCESS AND IT IS NOW STREAMLINED THROUGH THE CAL THE T. P. OR THE EDUCATION TREATMENT PROP PROGRAM- IF YOU ARE STILL HEARING FEEDBACK WE WOULD LOVE TO HEAR THAT. OKAY SO YOU'RE SAYING IS IT ART ALL THESE ARE ALREADY STREAMLINED THROUGH CALVET IS THAT RIGHT. YES THAT'S CORRECT D. PROCESS AT STREAMLINED ALL OF THE SIGNIFICANT CONSIDERATIONS THAT ANY FEEL GREAT FIRE PREVENTION EDUCATION TREATMENT PROGRAM- PROJECT WOULD. GO THROUGH AND IT INCORPORATES ALL CONSIDERATIONS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. WATER BOARDS AND- THE AIRPORT- AT THE AIR DISTRICT. OKAY I WELL I'D BE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU GUYS ON PROJECTS THAT I AM HEARING HAVE HAD ISSUES- BUT THEN I'LL GO TO THE NEXT QUESTION FOLLOW UP TO THAT IS. I THINK WE ALL AGREED THIS IS URGENT YOU KNOW WHAT THE FIRES THAT WE'VE HAD. WE NOW HAVE. A FIRE THE DIXIE FIRE THAT'S ON THE VERGE OF BEING A MILLION ACRE. A FIRE- NOTHING COULD BE MORE URGENT THAN DOING THESE PROJECTS RIGHT NOW. WHY NOT AS WE DID IN THIS BUDGET TRAILER BILL IT JUST EXEMPT FROM SEQUEL. THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS AS WE ARE DOING FOR PROJECTS FOR NATIVEFISH AND WILDLIFE. THAT'S IN THIS BILL. SO I'D GO TO THE ADMINISTRATION OR BUDGET STAFF. MAYBE BOTH. SO THAT WE DON'T I DON'T HAVE TO COME REPORT BACK TO YOU LIKE THOSE PROJECTS WILL BE ABLE TO JUST MOVE FORWARD UNDER AN EXEMPTION THE WAY THAT WE HAVE DONE FOR- A NATIVE FISH PROJECTS AND WHILE THAT PROJECTS IN THIS. TRAILER BILL. PART OF FINANCE I JUST SAY THAT THEY ARE- DIFFERENT VERY DIFFERENT TYPE OF PROJECTS- WE TALK ABOUT LIKE YOU KNOW HABITAT RESTORATION- OBVIOUSLY THE PROJECT THAT WE FUND UNDER. THE WALL FIRE WORTH PACKAGE HOWEVER YOU KNOW JUST GIVEN THAT IT IS A PRIORITY- THAT'S WHY THE CAL THE TPP ISN'T PLAYING. JUST REMIND HEAD THERE'S ALSO ADDITIONAL PROVISION THERE WE HAD IT IN BUDGET BUILDING WHICH TO- EXPEDITE THE CONTRACT YOU PROPERTIES. AS THOUGH YOUR SPEED EXACTLY A PRIORITY OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND JUST AS AN EXAMPLE WITH THE EARLY ACTION- PACKAGE THAT WAS. APPROVED IN APRIL- WITHIN THREE MONTHS BASICALLY 85% OF THOSE DOLLARS WERE. KIND OF AWARDED AND YOUR PROJECTS ARE ARE STARTING AND SO THE RESTORATION IS COMMITTED TO. CONTINUING TO DO WE CAN'T- STREAMLINED AND- STREAMLINED APPROPRIATELY- AND THAT'S WHY WE DO HAVE A KELLY COULD BE IN PLACE AND- WE'RE PUTTING IN ADDITIONAL MEASURES ON HOW TO CONTACT YOUR POLICIES MAKE SURE. THAT DOES NOT CREATE ADDITIONAL BARRIERS. GIVE BUDGET STAFFER OTHERS HAVE ANY COMMENT ON THAT. RESPONSE TO THAT YOU KNOW YOU HE JUST HEARD- MISS REVERSES COMMENT ON SEQUEL IN GENERAL SO OBVIOUSLY SEE ISSUES AREN'T TAKEN LIGHTLY. THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE HOUSE AND SHE CHAIRS ARE NOT RESOURCE COMMITTEE WERE THOSE BILLS WILL GO THROUGH SO IT'S NOT A- AUTOMATIC- I DON'T I DON'T THINK THERE'S UNANIMITY WITHIN THE HOUSE THAT THESE WOULD ALL BE APPLIED ACROSS THE BOARD THE ONLY TO BE CURRENT PLAN ACROSS THE BOARD. OKAY THAT. YEAH I UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT LIKE FROM BUDGET STAFF WAS THERE ANYTHING THAT WERE SAYING HEY WE DON'T WANT TO DO THIS FOR THOSE PROJECTS AND IT WAS THAT SOMETHING THAT WAS I THINK YOU GOT TO COME FROM THE CHAIR HASN'T. OKAY I'LL TAKE THAT IS THE ANSWER- HOW WILL THIS YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY AGAIN THESE ARE PRIORITY PROJECTS WE'RE GETTING ADDITIONAL FUNDING INTO THEM. AS THIS INTERACTS WITH- I BELIEVE IT'S A BILL BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE AT AB EIGHT SIXTY. HOW WILL THAT IMPACT THE ABILITY TO DO. AS MUCH ACREAGE AS WE WOULD LIKE TO DO- UNDER THESE. PROJECTS. I CANNOT TO OVER TO ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES. YES WE'RE GONNA PART OF FINANCE- I'M NOT SURE THE NEXUS BETWEEN- A BILL THAT YOU'RE REFERENCING SO WE CAN IT'S REALLY SPEAK TO THAT. WELL NO IT IS AS PART OF THE FOREST MANAGEMENT- KIND OF TASK REPLIED THAT BROUGHT TOGETHER YOU KNOW THE SHARED GOAL OF A FIVE HUNDRED. THOUSAND ACRES TREATED ANNUALLY BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. SO THAT'S THE YOU KNOW THE TARGET PUT FORWARD- IN IN THESE PLANS AS SO YEAH I THINK IT IS IF COMMITTED WITH YOU THIS FUNDING TO- YOU KNOW PLAY ITS SHARE AND THAT THAT GOAL WHICH INCLUDE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT INCLUDES- STATE GOVERNMENT INCLUDES- PRIVATE LANDOWNERS AND SO THAT YOU KNOW FIVE HUNDRED. ACRES ANNUALLY BY A HUNDRED THOUSAND EXACTLY BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IS THE VEHICLE THAT WE PUT OUT. OKAY I'LL BE MORE SPECIFIC- I UNDERSTAND THAT'S THE GOAL THAT'S ACTUALLY AB EIGHT SB SIX EIGHTY I BELIEVE WHICH WOULD REQUIRE ANY CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION PROJECTS. TO BE SUBJECT TO PREVAILING. WAGE AND OR APPEAL A- HOW IS THAT GOING TO END. HOW FAR MONEY GO A OF. ACREAGE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW A LOT OF THOSE PROJECTS. WHEN YOU DO THESE FUEL REDUCTION PROJECTS THEY'RE NOT PREVAILING WAGE. YEAH I'M NOT TOO SURE HOW WITH A BIG ON ON THAT BILL AND HOW THAT WOULD IMPACT- OUR PACKAGE I'M NOT SURE TAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE. SO YOU DON'T KNOW IS THAT YOU'RE SAYING. YEAH I DON'T THINK I KNOW THE DEADLINE OF TO KNOW THE NEXUS BETWEEN THAT AND HOW IT CAN IMPACT- THIS- PROJECT AND MUCH OF WE HAVE A POSITION ON ON THAT BILL. OKAY WE WOULD REALLY BE GOOD TO KNOW THAT BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BE TAKEN UP THESE BILLS THIS WEEK. AND YOU KNOW IF THERE'S GOING TO BE AN IMPACT ON HOW MANY ACRES WE CAN TREAT OBVIOUSLY GETTING TO THE GOAL OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND. THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM. AND SO WE NEED TO HEAR FROM. THE ADMINISTRATION FROM OTHERS BUDGET STAFF- AND ANYBODY ELSE ON THIS CALL THAT HER AUNT THAT'S- I DON'T KNOW WHO'S ON HERE BUT CAN ANYBODY ANSWER THAT QUESTION BECAUSE THIS IS PRETTY IMPORTANT TO MY CONSTITUENTS AND I THINK ALL CALIFORNIANS FOR THAT MATTER. TO MR GALLAGHER WITH ALL WITH ALL RESPECT I MEAN WE DO HAVE A SEPARATE BILL PROCESS ENSURE I WOULD DIRECT YOU TO- COMMITTEE BILL ANALYSIS I ASSUME OR HOPE THAT THOSE ANALYSES WOULD HAVE COVERED. THOSE ITEMS I DON'T THINK THAT ANYBODY ON THIS PARTICULAR CALL IS PREPARED OR ABLE TO. REALLY ANSWER THAT SPECIFIC QUESTION ON THE BILL. HI COULD ANYONE HAVE MISSED NOT TALKING ABOUT A BILL ABOUT JUST IN GENERAL LIKE IF WE'RE SUBJECTING THESE PROJECTS ALL TO PREVAILING WAGE DOES THAT. IS I CAN HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE MONEY AIRS ON TREES. IF YOU IF YOU GOT THE CIVIC WASHINGTON. THE ITEM THAT'S FINE BUT I THINK ASKING PEOPLE TO ANSWER HYPOTHETICALS IS A DIFFICULT. QUESTION SOME OTHERS YOU SEE ALL THIS LEAVE IT AS IT IS THERE ANYBODY THAT CAN ANSWER THAT. IF NOT THAT'S FINE BUT IS THERE SOMEBODY THAT CAN ANSWER THAT I THINK EVERYONE'S TRY TO ANSWER TO THE BEST OF THEIR ABILITY RIGHT NOW. SURE TO KEEP NOT ONLY HEARD FROM ONE PERSON. IF YOU WANT TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT QUESTION THAT BE GREAT OTHERWISE WE'LL MOVE ON TO MY FRIEND YEAH SO WHAT I'M HEARING IS THAT HEY WE'RE NOT GOING TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION THAT'S WHAT I. KNOW WHAT I'M HEARING IS YOU'RE ASKING A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION AND I'M I'M SAYING THAT IS VERY DIFFICULT ANSWER HYPOTHETICAL QUESTIONS THERE IT ISN'T HYPOTHETICAL BECAUSE WE HAVE A BILL IN PRINT AB. SIXTY GO TO THE BILL ANALYSIS FOR. YES IN THIS BUDGET. THEY INTERRELATE THEY ABSOLUTELY INTERRELATE. BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW THIS IS GOING TO IMPACT CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION WHICH IS IN THIS BUDGET BILL- SO I'M SURE THERE'S SOMEBODY WHO CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION BUT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO ANSWER IT AND THAT'S FINE. I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO CHANGE YOUR VOTE ON THAT BILLOR THE BUDGET SO KEEP GOING. PLEASE. IT'S NOT JUST FOR ME A MISTER CHAIRMAN IS FOR THE PUBLIC. AND FOR PEOPLE TO KNOW HOW THIS IS BEING DONE THAT. BUT I'VE- I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND ALL. THE HYPE ON THE ELECTION PLEASE MOVE ON. IT'S NOT HYPOTHETICAL BUT- RIGHT HERE'S ANOTHER NOT HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION- TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. IN THE WATER BOND HAS ACTUALLY ALREADY BEEN ALLOCATED IT'S BEEN ALLOCATED SINCE TWENTY EIGHTEEN. WHEN THE WATER COMMISSION ALLOCATED THOSE DOLLARS TO THESE DIFFERENT PROJECTS. THAT'S NOT HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IN THIS BUDGET. THE MONEY HAS ALREADY BEEN. ALLOCATED TO THOSE PROJECTS. SAID ABOUT BUT YOU HAD ON THE POINT WHICH IS A LOT OF THESE PROJECTS A LOT TO GET THROUGH PERMITTING- SO FOR EXAMPLE SITES RESERVOIR. HAS BEEN ALLOCATED A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF BAHMANI I BELIEVE IT'S A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION- BUT THEY'RE STILL STUCK IN DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE PERMITTING. SO WHAT IS THE DOES THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE ANY PLANS TO HELP STREAMLINE THAT'S BEEN TWO YEARS NOW. OVER TWO YEARS- THAT THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN STUCK IN PERMITTING AND I'M SURE THERE'S OTHER PROJECT WITH THE SAME PROBLEM. SO IS THERE ANY EFFORT ON BEHALF OF THE ADMINISTRATION TO STREAMLINE THAT PERMITTING PROCESS FAST TRACK THAT PERMITTING PROCESS. GIVEN THAT THIS IS A VERY URGENT NEED AND THESE PROJECTS HAVE ALREADY BEEN IDENTIFIED AS WORTHY OF FUNDING. YEAH I THINK GOD FOR DR ARE FAR FINANCE AGAIN I THINK WE'LL HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU WITH- THAT- RESPONSE ON ANY KIND OF STREAMLINING ON THE PROP ONE PROJECTS. OKAY NEED ANYBODY ELSE. OKAY WELL THAT'S THE END OF MY QUESTIONS I MEAN I GUESS I'M NOT GONNA GET A LOT OF ANSWERS TODAY I DO WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK ON GETTING THE CONTINUES APPROPRIATIONS VERY IMPORTANT. I WANT TO UNDERSCORE THAT THAT GREAT APPRECIATION TO GETTING THAT DONE- THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES WE GOT TO ADDRESS HOPEFULLY WE CAN DO THAT. THIS WEEK OR IN THE NEAR FUTURE THANK YOU. I'M GONNA GO MISTER BETTER THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY THIS WORKED HARD ON THIS OF THE CHAIR LEGISLATIVE STAFF GOVERNOR STAFF APARTMENT FINANCE EVERYBODY ELSE- IT IT IT HAS BEEN A HUGE CHALLENGE AND- IT'S A CHALLENGE AND BUDGETS ARE TIGHT AS CHALLENGE BUDGETS ARE ALSO OPEN. IN SURPLUS AND HAVE THAT OUT THERE I JUST WANNA VERY QUICKLY POINT OUT THAT- I PARTICULARLY APPRECIATE STAFF AND EVERYBODY'S- OF INSURING THAT SAY- CONTRACT COUNTIES WERE ABLE TO RECEIVE THE FUNDING FOR THE EXTRA FIRE CREWS THAT THEY HAD REQUESTED. AND POINT OUT THAT- I HOPE AS WE ARE SPENDING SIGNIFICANT WILL STICK SIGNIFICANTLY MORE RESOURCES ON WILDFIRE PREVENTION THAT WE- TRY TO MAKE SURE WE LEARN AS MUCH AS WE CAN THIS YEAR. SO WE KNOW WHAT ARE THE PRIORITY EXPENDITURES THAT REALLY HAVE AN IMPACT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR. THANK YOU MISTER LEE. THANK YOU ALLEN I THINK THE- PROVIDED CHAIR I'M SITTING AND ALL THE STAFF FOR WORKING REALLY CLOSELY WITH OUR EDUCATIONAL ADVOCATES I JUST HAVE A COUPLE CLARIFYING QUESTIONS OF WHAT'S- ONE SIXTY SEVEN SB ONE SIX ABOUT THE SCHOOLS I KNOW WE TOUCHED ON THIS EARLIER BUT WHEN I JUST MAKE SURE AND CLARIFY THAT TO SCHOOLS WILL STILL BE ABLE TO RECEIVE ADA FOR QUARANTINE STUDENTS CORRECT. YES. YES PASSED THAT IS CORRECT DOES THAT INCLUDE ALSO STUDENTS WHO. ARE EXPOSED HAVE WITHIN THEIR OWN TIME OF TESTING AND WAITING FOR THE RESULTS OF THE TESTING. THOSE DAYS YEAH FOR ME TURN THAT QUESTION THE MORE DETAILED QUESTION OVER TO ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES- EITHER JESSICA HOLMES OR- PERSONALITY. HI AND JUST GO HOMES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'M STILL I'M SORRY YOUR QUESTION WAS STUDENTS WHO ARE NOT IN SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY'RE WAITING FOR TEST RESULTS RIGHT IF THEY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED OR LEARN TO EXPOSURE BUT THEY HAVE NOT YET BEEN PUT IN THE FORMAL. QUARANTINE TO THE DAYS OF WHICH AFTER IS WAIT FOR RESULTS OR GET TESTED COUNT TOWARDS ADA. YES YES WE WOULD CONSIDER THAT BECAUSE THERE BECAUSE IT'S UNCERTAIN WHAT THEIR STATUS IS IN THERE THEY'RE BEING EXCLUDED FROM SCHOOL BECAUSE THE CONTENT- WE WOULD AS LONG AS THE- LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCY. WAS PROVIDING INDEPENDENT STUDY THEY WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THAT- THEY WOULD BE THAT THEY WOULD BE ALLOWED TO RECEIVE A PORTION THAT. COULD GET THAT'S A GREAT CONCERN THAT WAS BROUGHT TO ME BY A LOT OF MY SCHOOL WHERE MEMBERS PRETENCE I'M GLAD THAT IS INCLUDED IN THIS FIX AND- I KNOW THERE'S STILL A LOT OF CHALLENGES OF THE DELTA PERCENT DELTA VARIANT AND OTHER PARENTS PERHAPS FOR ASSIST. AND WE MORE CHANGES PERHAPS WILL HAVE TO BE MAKING TO OUR SCHOOLS TO MAKE SURE WE CAN ADAPT TO IT BUT THAT'S GOOD TO SEE THAT. AND THEN I KNOW YOU'LL SUCH FUND IS A LITTLE BIT BUT- TO COMBAT THE CUTE SURE- TEACHER SHORTAGE ESPECIALLY WITH UNDER THE NEW INDEPENDENT STUDY GUIDELINES WHAT IS BEING A PORTION THE BUDGET TO HELP THAT TO MAKE. SURE THERE'S MORE ITS TEACHINGS PERSONNEL. SO IN THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT THAT WAS IT AND ADOPTED AND ACTED- BACK IN JULY AND IT WAS JULY SEVENTH- WE INCLUDED MORE THAN THREE BILLION DOLLARS. IN NEW. I RESOURCES INTENDED TO SUPPORT TEACHER RETENTION AND RECRUITMENT- IT WENT TO QUITE A FEW DIFFERENT- INITIATIVES BUT- THEY WERE SOME OF THE MORE INCLUDING AND IT AND IT REPAYMENT OF. STUDENT LOANS OR SCHOLARSHIPS ESSENTIALLY- TO TEACHERS WHO TAUGHT IN HIGH NEED AREAS I'M FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AND WE ALSO HAD FUNDS GOING TOWARDS A SIGNIFICANT FUNDS GOING TOWARDS TEACHER TRAINING- SO IT SAID THERE WERE THERE WAS QUITE A BIT OF MONEY AND IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT THAT WAS ADOPTED BACK IN JULY. AND TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES SO THREE BILLION IS ALLOCATED DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH OF IT WAS ALREADY EXPENDED. EXPENDED FROM WHAT WAS ENACTED IN JULY- I'LL- NEVER AND PASS ON. NO NO IT'S IT I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION I WOULD ASSUME PROBABLY NOT NOT A LOT OF IT- BUT AND BUT I KNOW THAT THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF URGENCY TO GET THOSE FUNDS OUT AND TO AND TO GET THOSE PROCESSES MOVING I THINK THE OTHER THING. THAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING HARD TO DO IS TO PROVIDE- AT THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ALSO INTO IT OUR COLLEAGUES OVER THE STATE BOARD I'M INFORMATION TO ELEAZAR ON PROGRAMS THAT ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE HAVE BEEN AND HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE- THAT THEY CAN BE UTILIZING RIGHT NOW IN ORDER TO HELP THEM AND IT MAY NOT BE NECESSARILY IN THE IN THE IN THE VERY SHORT TERM BUT BUT IN THE MIDDLE AND LONG TERM TO HELP BUILD THEIR CAPACITY OUT. THERE'S ALSO SOME RECENT CHANGES AROUND THINGS LIKE- EXTENDING THE C. BEST A WAIVER FOR. EACH TYPE OF EDUCATIONAL STAFF THAT- THAT STATE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHEN HIGHER THAT HAPPENED BACK IN THE JULY BUDGET AS WELL SO THERE ARE THERE ARE MANY SORT OF HORT TERM AND MIDDLE LONG TERM THINGS THAT FOLKS ARE WORKING ON BEYOND JUST THE FUNDING TO HELP ADDRESS SOME OF THESE NEEDS AND CONCERNS. GREAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. THANK YOU EIGHT ONE IS THERE BY ALSO THINKING THE CHAIR AND ALL THE STUFF IS BEEN WORKING- TEARS THE ALL YEAR ON THIS BUDGET I WAS THE ONE I THINK THE ATTENTION AROUND SAFE DRINKING WATER IN DROUGHT RESILIENCE- AND YOUR BILLION DOLLARS THAT IS BEING IMPLEMENTED THERE AS WE'RE SEEING THEIR HISTORIC DROUGHT ACROSS THE STATE AGAIN. I WANTED THIS ALLOCATION INCLUDES THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS- TO ADDRESS THE PEAPOD'S ISSUES. ANOTHER AT LEAST THREE HUNDRED WELL THAT HAVE BEEN I DISCONNECTED BECAUSE OF THE CONTAMINATION OF PEAPOD'S WHICH MEANS WE'RE RELYING ON MORE IMPORTED WATER. IN BECOMING LESS DROUGHT RESILIENT IN COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE AND SO I DO APPRECIATE. THAT INVESTMENT ACT. EARLY ON IN IN THIS CRISIS THAT WE'RE SEEING- BUT IT WOULD JUST COME FOR THE CITY HUNTER WELLS THIS IS ABOUT A FIFTH OF. OF THE MONEY THAT WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA NEED JUST TO START THE PROCESS- AND SO I DO HOPE THAT IN THE FUTURE WE CONTINUE TO TRACK THIS- AND WE CONTINUE TO. HELP COMMUNITIES LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES CAN AFFORD TO DO THAT THEMSELVES TO THE NOT BECAUSE THE PROVINCE ITSELF AND SO. JUST I AM APPRECIATED THAT WE ARE TAKING AN IMPORTANT STEP IN ACKNOWLEDGING THE NEED OUT THERE- AND BEING A LEADER FOR A FOR THE STATE IN THIS ISSUE AND- LOOK FORWARD TO ADDITIONAL WORKED ON THE RIGHT ON THIS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANKS FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THE THAT P. FAST ISSUE MR MCCARTY. YES YOU I JUST WANTED TO TOUCH BASES ON BASE- THE EDUCATION CLEAN UP BILLS HEARING I KNOW. MISTER VICE CHAIR MENTIONED THAT WE HAVE MULTIPLE. BUDGET BILL JUNIORS BUT I THINK THAT'S BEING RESPONSIBLE BECAUSE WE'RE IN A GLOBAL PANDEMIC. IT'S REALLY HARD PUTTING KIDDING KIDS BACK TO SCHOOL. I THINK LOUD AND CLEAR HERE LAST YEAR WE REALIZE THAT ZOOM SCHOOL. DID NOT WORK ESPECIALLY FOR SO MANY COMMUNITIES. WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY. STAY AT HOME PARENTS WHO CAN STAY ON TOP OF THEIR KIDS. THE THIS IS LEARNING LOS IT'S YOU KNOW. NINE LOS BECAUSE THAT LEARNING NEVER HAPPEN THE FIRST PLACE AND SO. OUR DEFAULT IS GOING BACK TO SCHOOL AND I THINK THAT- THE CLARIFICATIONS HERE ON INDEPENDENT STUDY. ARE ARE APPROPRIATE I KNOW SOMEONE US TO GREEN LIGHT GOING BACK. TO FULL VIRTUAL AND ZOOM SCHOOL AND WE'RE NOT DOING THAT. I THINK WORSE WE'RE STAYING THE COURSE HERE WE ARE CLARIFYING. THAT EDA CAN AND SHALL BE RECEIVED AS MR LEE NOTED WHEN STUDENTS ARE ON QUARANTINE. OR IN LIMBO. OF THAT. OR THE PARENTS JUST AREN'T COMFORTABLE IF THEY WANT THEIR KIDS TO GO. AND DO SOME INDEPENDENT STUDY- BASICALLY AND I TALKED TO- MR ARAMBULA TODAY AND FRESNO ONE OF MY DISTRICT HERE IN SACRAMENTO IT'S ABOUT 5% OF THE POPULATION OF THE PARENTS. DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE WHAT DOES THAT MEAN THAT MEANS 95% WANT TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE WE ARE FOCUSING ON- AND THERE'S A LOT OF. UNCERTAINTY THE DELTA VARIANT TO WHAT HELPS PEOPLE WITH COMMON WHO ARE VACCINATED. I WENT THROUGH THAT TO MYSELF I WAS ACTUALLY IN IRAQ OF ITSELF. IT CAN'T HAPPEN- BUT WE JUST HAVE TO ADAPT AND KEEP MOVING. IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS I KNOW PEOPLE ARE SAYING. WE SHOULD HAVE A PLAN BE ABLE SOMETHING HAPPENS IN THE FALL WITH THERE'S LIKE A CRAZY NOTE. VERY EXPLOSION WE CAN COME BACK ADDRESS THIS IN A SPECIAL SESSION- FOR SOMETHING ELSE BUT RIGHT NOW.
