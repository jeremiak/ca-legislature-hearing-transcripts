00:40:28.259 --> 00:40:29.360
IMPORTANT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE

00:40:29.426 --> 00:40:31.162
BECAUSE AGAIN IN TWENTY

00:40:31.228 --> 00:40:31.862
EIGHTEEN I CO AUTHORED ALONG

00:40:31.929 --> 00:40:33.030
WITH OUR FORMER COLLEAGUE

00:40:33.097 --> 00:40:35.833
SENATOR LARA SENATE BILL THREE

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:36.300
NINETY FIVE WHICH IS A

00:40:36.367 --> 00:40:40.571
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT INDUSTRY.

00:40:40.638 --> 00:40:41.138
PROHIBIT ANY MINOR UNDER THE

00:40:41.205 --> 00:40:42.740
AGE OF TO WAIVE THEM RIGHTS

00:40:42.807 --> 00:40:43.374
WITHOUT THE ADVICE OF AN

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:45.209
ATTORNEY THE POINT I'M TRYING

00:40:45.276 --> 00:40:46.744
TO MAKE IT AS YOU KNOW HOW WE

00:40:46.811 --> 00:40:48.279
ARE DEFINING KIND OF AGE OF

00:40:48.345 --> 00:40:50.381
MATURITY WHEN YOU FUNDAMENTALLY

00:40:50.447 --> 00:40:52.349
UNDERSTAND YOUR RIGHTS. WELL

00:40:52.416 --> 00:40:53.517
AGAIN THAT BILL PERTAINS TO THE

00:40:53.584 --> 00:40:54.819
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SPACE IT'S

00:40:54.885 --> 00:40:56.287
ANOTHER REMINDER THAT WE MUST

00:40:56.353 --> 00:40:57.922
DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROTECT

00:40:57.988 --> 00:41:00.324
OUR CHILDREN AT EVERY AGE AND

00:41:00.391 --> 00:41:02.026
STAGE IN THEIR LIFE AND WHETHER

00:41:02.092 --> 00:41:03.594
THEY'RE INTERFACING WITH THE

00:41:03.661 --> 00:41:05.329
JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM OR

00:41:05.396 --> 00:41:07.965
THEY'RE- THEY'RE YOUNG ACTORS

00:41:08.032 --> 00:41:09.133
IT'S EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT WE

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:11.502
ACKNOWLEDGE. AGES AND STAGES OF

00:41:11.569 --> 00:41:14.071
MATURITY SO I DID SUPPORT

00:41:14.138 --> 00:41:14.638
TWENTY THREE THIRTY THAT THE

00:41:14.705 --> 00:41:15.806
TIME IT BUT IT'S BECOME CLEAR

00:41:15.873 --> 00:41:17.975
WITH IMPLEMENTATION OF ALL

00:41:18.042 --> 00:41:18.809
THESE BILLS AND ESPECIALLY

00:41:18.876 --> 00:41:19.944
COMING OUT OF THE ME TOO

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:22.713
MOVEMENT THAT NOT ALL CHILD IS

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:24.748
IMMUNE TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

00:41:24.815 --> 00:41:26.483
AND ALL ACTORS REGARDLESS OF

00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:28.352
AGE SHOULD AT LEAST KNOW THEIR

00:41:28.419 --> 00:41:30.387
RIGHTS SO I JUST WANTED TO

00:41:30.454 --> 00:41:31.889
RAISE A THAT ISSUE GOING ON THE

00:41:31.956 --> 00:41:34.925
PREVIOUS BILL- YOU SET THAT AGE

00:41:34.992 --> 00:41:36.560
RANGE THE MIDDLE MADE FROM

00:41:36.627 --> 00:41:40.898
FOURTEEN. AND HOPE THAT THERE'S

00:41:40.965 --> 00:41:41.966
OPPORTUNITY HAVE ON GOING TO.

00:41:42.032 --> 00:41:47.471
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S JUST. WE

00:41:47.538 --> 00:41:49.206
ARE LEAVING MANY CHILDREN VOTE.

00:41:49.273 --> 00:41:50.374
AND ADDRESS. FAR TOO MANY IF WE

00:41:50.441 --> 00:41:51.609
LOOK BACK AT SOME OF THE CASES

00:41:51.675 --> 00:41:53.644
THAT HAVE COME BEFORE US. NOT

00:41:53.711 --> 00:41:54.578
BEFORE US WOULD HAVE BECOME

00:41:54.645 --> 00:41:57.314
PUBLIC ALL THE YOUNG WOMEN ON

00:41:57.381 --> 00:41:59.884
PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES THE- JIM

00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:05.256
THIS- SO MANY YOUNG MEN AND

00:42:05.322 --> 00:42:07.091
WOMEN WHO HAVE COME. MAY THERE

00:42:07.157 --> 00:42:08.859
OWN SEXUAL ABUSE OR MISCONDUCT

00:42:08.926 --> 00:42:11.028
PUBLIC WE KNOW THAT FOURTEEN IS

00:42:11.095 --> 00:42:12.730
NOT A MAGICAL AGE AND SO THAT'S

00:42:12.796 --> 00:42:13.597
WHY I WANTED TO RAISE THE

00:42:13.664 --> 00:42:16.567
ISSUE- AND HOPEFULLY ENCOURAGE

00:42:16.634 --> 00:42:19.603
YOU. OUR COLLECTIVE TO PERHAPS

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:21.338
COME BACK IN FUTURE YEARS AND

00:42:21.405 --> 00:42:22.840
ADDRESS THAT AGE I KNOW THE

00:42:22.907 --> 00:42:24.441
POINT OF THIS BILL IS FIGURING

00:42:24.508 --> 00:42:26.343
OUT WHO'S ALLOWED TO DO THE

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:27.544
TRAINING PARENTS HAVE TO BE

00:42:27.611 --> 00:42:31.715
ENGAGE I GET THAT. BUT I THINK

00:42:31.782 --> 00:42:34.818
THAT WE ARE. NOT LEAVE AT BEST

00:42:34.885 --> 00:42:36.587
IT WILL SOON FOURTEEN AT THE

00:42:36.654 --> 00:42:38.322
APPROPRIATE AGE TO REQUIRE THIS

00:42:38.389 --> 00:42:40.925
KIND OF TRAINING TO EMPOWER

00:42:40.991 --> 00:42:43.794
CHILDREN TO KNOW THEIR RIGHTS.

00:42:43.861 --> 00:42:45.496
I WOULD LIKE TO JUST EXPRESS MY

00:42:45.562 --> 00:42:48.866
GRATITUDE TO YOU- FOR PAYING

00:42:48.933 --> 00:42:51.568
ATTENTION TO THE DETAILS HERE-

00:42:51.635 --> 00:42:54.371
WE BUMPED INTO EACH OTHER- WEEK

00:42:54.438 --> 00:42:55.839
OR SO AGO IN THE GARAGE AND WE

00:42:55.906 --> 00:42:57.708
DON'T HAVE A CHANCE TO CONNECT-

00:42:57.775 --> 00:42:59.543
BUT WHAT I WANTED TO SAY TO YOU

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:03.447
THEN. WAS ON HOW CREATIVE I WAS

00:43:03.514 --> 00:43:06.951

00:43:07.017 --> 00:43:08.485
OVERSIGHT HEARING ON

00:43:08.552 --> 00:43:10.521
CORRECTIONS THAT TOOK PLACE

00:43:10.587 --> 00:43:13.023
DURING THE PANDEMIC- AND SO

00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:14.959
YOUR ATTENTION TO DETAIL AND

00:43:15.025 --> 00:43:18.729
PURSUING- THINGS OVER TIME- IS

00:43:18.796 --> 00:43:20.230
SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:43:20.297 --> 00:43:23.434
IS MUCH STRONGER FOR- AND- WITH

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:25.269
REFERENCE TO THIS ISSUE. WE'VE

00:43:25.336 --> 00:43:26.670
BOTH BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR A

00:43:26.737 --> 00:43:29.673
NUMBER OF YEARS THIS BILL IS-

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:31.542
BILL NUMBER I DON'T KNOW HOW

00:43:31.608 --> 00:43:33.877
MANY SINCE I FIRST INTRODUCED

00:43:33.944 --> 00:43:37.881
THE FIRST VERSION. I BELIEVE IN

00:43:37.948 --> 00:43:38.582
TWENTY SIXTEEN THAT WAS NOT

00:43:38.649 --> 00:43:41.785
SUCCESSFUL UNTIL THE ME TOO

00:43:41.852 --> 00:43:44.455
MOVEMENT PUSH THIS UP. IN THE

00:43:44.521 --> 00:43:46.724
MINDS OF- THE APPROPRIATIONS

00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:50.561
COMMITTEES AND SO FORTH SO- YES

00:43:50.627 --> 00:43:52.296
WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO I

00:43:52.363 --> 00:43:53.664
BELIEVE THERE IS ANOTHER BILL

00:43:53.731 --> 00:43:55.666
COMING UP LATER. ON THE AGENDA

00:43:55.733 --> 00:43:57.868
THAT ALSO ADDRESSES THIS AND-

00:43:57.935 --> 00:44:00.537
AND SO- OUR WORK IS CUT OUT FOR

00:44:00.604 --> 00:44:02.172

FUTURE GENERATIONS THAT WE

00:44:06.543 --> 00:44:08.912
CONTINUE TO LOOK AT. NOT ONLY

00:44:08.979 --> 00:44:10.914

CONTINUED WORK IN THIS AREA AND

00:45:07.871 --> 00:45:10.607
THIS ISSUE- BUT AS REGARDS.

00:45:10.674 --> 00:45:12.076
THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR PAN

00:45:12.142 --> 00:45:13.477
AND AS WE LOOK AT THE

00:45:13.544 --> 00:45:15.112
DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN I THINK

00:45:15.179 --> 00:45:16.280
THAT WE ALSO NEED TO BE

00:45:16.346 --> 00:45:18.048
CONCERNED ABOUT TO THOSE WHO

00:45:18.115 --> 00:45:19.883
PREY ON CHILDREN REGARDLESS OF

00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:21.151
THEIR DEVELOPMENT AND THIS IS

00:45:21.218 --> 00:45:24.054
SOMETHING THAT- WE WE'VE GOT-

00:45:24.121 --> 00:45:25.389
TO CONTINUE WORKING ON SO THANK

00:45:25.456 --> 00:45:29.860
YOU. I THANK. YOU A SENATOR

00:45:29.927 --> 00:45:31.929
JACKSON. THANK YOU I KNOW THAT.

00:45:31.995 --> 00:45:34.198
IS GETTING A LITTLE EXPANDED

00:45:34.264 --> 00:45:35.632
AND- I THINK IT SHOULD SHOULD

00:45:35.699 --> 00:45:38.001
BE WE KNOW THAT THIS INDUSTRY

00:45:38.068 --> 00:45:41.305
IS NOTORIOUS. WHETHER IT'S

00:45:41.371 --> 00:45:44.508
CHILDREN OR ADULTS. AND YOU

00:45:44.575 --> 00:45:46.643
KNOW THERE ARE SO MANY HIGHLY

00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:48.979
PUBLICIZED INCIDENTS AND I'M

00:45:49.046 --> 00:45:49.546
SURE THERE ARE SO MANY MORE

00:45:49.613 --> 00:45:51.348
THAN AREN'T. I THINK IT'S

00:45:51.415 --> 00:45:53.917
INCUMBENT UPON US NOT ONLY TO

00:45:53.984 --> 00:45:55.652
EDUCATE OUR CHILDREN AND THEIR

00:45:55.719 --> 00:45:57.921
PARENTS WHO ARE FREQUENTLY ON

00:45:57.988 --> 00:45:58.922
SET WITH THEM AS THEIR

00:45:58.989 --> 00:46:00.958
GUARDIANS BUT I THINK WE HAVE

00:46:01.024 --> 00:46:02.659
TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE

00:46:02.726 --> 00:46:04.728
PERPETRATORS ARE WELL AWARE

00:46:04.795 --> 00:46:06.930
THAT THERE ARE A CRIMINAL AND

00:46:06.997 --> 00:46:08.732
CIVIL CONSEQUENCES TO THIS

00:46:08.799 --> 00:46:10.501
BEHAVIOR. BECAUSE WE'RE NOT

00:46:10.567 --> 00:46:12.035
GOING TO BE ABLE TO CATCH IT

00:46:12.102 --> 00:46:13.504
ALL THESE YOUNGSTERS ARE ALMOST

00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:15.839
BY DEFINITION A VERY VULNERABLE

00:46:15.906 --> 00:46:18.509
THEIR CHILDREN- AND- I THINK

00:46:18.575 --> 00:46:20.043
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THIS

00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:22.179
BE WE KEEP THE- OF THE KLIEG

00:46:22.246 --> 00:46:24.448
LIGHTS IF YOU WILL- IN VERY

00:46:24.515 --> 00:46:28.552
SHARP- DIRECTION- ON THIS

00:46:28.619 --> 00:46:31.622
INDUSTRY BECAUSE OF JUST THE

00:46:31.688 --> 00:46:33.857
INHERENT. NATURE OF ITS HISTORY

00:46:33.924 --> 00:46:35.459
AND THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THIS

00:46:35.526 --> 00:46:37.995
KIND OF ABUSE- BASED UPON THE

00:46:38.061 --> 00:46:40.130
IMBALANCE OF POWER. IN

00:46:40.197 --> 00:46:42.766
OPPORTUNITY THAT EXISTS SO- I

00:46:42.833 --> 00:46:45.102
ALSO THANK YOU FOR THIS AND

00:46:45.169 --> 00:46:45.936
AGREE WITH THE SENATOR MITCHELL

00:46:46.003 --> 00:46:48.972
THAT. REALLY THE VULNERABILITY

00:46:49.039 --> 00:46:51.942
IS SOMETHING THAT. OCCURS EVEN

00:46:52.009 --> 00:46:53.544
AT YOUNGER AGES BUT AND BUT

00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:56.813
THIS IS A WHOLE ISSUE- I HATE

00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:58.882
TO SELECT THIS INDUSTRY BUT WE

00:46:58.949 --> 00:47:00.918
DO KNOW THAT HISTORICALLY IT

00:47:00.984 --> 00:47:03.687
HAS A VERY MURKY PAST- AND

00:47:03.754 --> 00:47:05.155
WE'VE SEEN INSTANCES VERY

BEHAVIOR WITH CHILDREN. I IT

00:47:12.396 --> 00:47:14.898
REALLY IS AN AREA WHERE WE HAVE

00:47:14.965 --> 00:47:17.968
TO DO- AND BE VERY AGGRESSIVE

00:47:18.035 --> 00:47:20.103

TRAINING. THANK YOU FOR THE

01:02:01.451 --> 01:02:04.020
QUESTION OF THE SENATOR- YOU

KNOW CERTAINLY I THINK THAT

01:02:06.055 --> 01:02:07.423
TOOK FOCUS HERE REALLY IS ON

01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:09.158
THE EMPLOYER MANDATES A

01:02:09.225 --> 01:02:11.461
TRAINING OF A TRAINING PROGRAM

01:02:11.527 --> 01:02:13.896
OR SOMETHING SPECIFIC TO. THE

01:02:13.963 --> 01:02:15.665
WORK THAT'S BEING ASKED OF

01:02:15.731 --> 01:02:17.300
THESE TO RED RIVER DIRECT CARE

01:02:17.366 --> 01:02:20.103
PERSONNEL SO- IF THERE IS SOME

01:02:20.169 --> 01:02:21.671
KIND OF COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY

01:02:21.737 --> 01:02:25.708
THAT IS BEING. ASKED OF A OF

01:02:25.775 --> 01:02:27.643
THE APPLICANT AND THEN AND THEN

01:02:27.710 --> 01:02:29.378
IN THAT CASE IT WOULD APPLY IF

01:02:29.445 --> 01:02:30.680

JOB THAT IS BEING- ASKED OF THE

01:02:34.283 --> 01:02:35.551
OF THE DIRECT PATIENT CARE

01:02:35.618 --> 01:02:37.420
WORKER BUT I THINK YOUR POINT

01:02:37.487 --> 01:02:38.187
IF IT'S A MUCH MORE GENERAL

01:02:38.254 --> 01:02:39.489
KNOWLEDGE KIND OF ISSUE OF

01:02:39.555 --> 01:02:41.858
IMAGINE. THAT THAT WOULD BE-

01:02:41.924 --> 01:02:42.725
YOU KNOW A PART OF THE

01:02:42.792 --> 01:02:43.759
INTERPRETATION WHETHER IT

01:02:43.826 --> 01:02:45.695
REALLY IS SPECIFIC TO THAT JOB

01:02:45.761 --> 01:02:47.163
OR NOT BUT IT REALLY IT RELLY

01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:49.999
COMES DOWN TO- IF THAT BECAUSE

01:02:50.066 --> 01:02:51.534
NOWADAYS THERE VERY WELL MAY BE

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:52.835
SOME KIND OF TECHNOLOGY OR

01:02:52.902 --> 01:02:54.470
SOFTWARE WITHOUT YOU THAT MAY

01:02:54.537 --> 01:02:57.173
BE LOST- THAT THAT WOULD

01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:58.374
QUALIFY AS UNNECESSARY

01:02:58.441 --> 01:03:00.309
EXPENDITURE BUT TO YOUR POINT.

01:03:00.376 --> 01:03:01.878
I THINK THAT- YOU KNOW IT WOULD

01:03:01.944 --> 01:03:03.779
IT WOULD BE TRAINING THAT'S

01:03:03.846 --> 01:03:04.847
BEING ASKED OF BY THE EMPLOYER

01:03:04.914 --> 01:03:08.351

INTIMACY. FOR THIS MEASURE I

01:03:19.562 --> 01:03:21.264
THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE- IF

01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:23.232
THERE COULD BE SOME CLARITY ON

01:03:23.299 --> 01:03:24.934
THAT I THINK IT MIGHT HELP.

01:03:25.001 --> 01:03:26.602
GOING FORWARD WHERE THERE MIGHT

01:03:26.669 --> 01:03:27.870
BE A DISPUTE BETWEEN THE

01:03:27.937 --> 01:03:29.672

WAS ARTICULATE AND GLAMPING AND

01:52:11.357 --> 01:52:12.792
I CLEARLY HEADED SAW. IDMS

01:52:12.859 --> 01:52:15.595
DOWN- MANY OF WHICH I THINK ARE

01:52:15.662 --> 01:52:18.131
SPACIOUS BUT NONETHELESS-

01:52:18.198 --> 01:52:20.233
PERHAPS PERSUASIVE ALTHOUGH I

01:52:20.300 --> 01:52:22.335
DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD BE. AND

01:52:22.402 --> 01:52:24.003
I WAS STRUCK BY THE PEOPLE WHO

01:52:24.070 --> 01:52:26.139
TESTIFIED IN SUPPORT. THESE ARE

01:52:26.206 --> 01:52:28.108
PEOPLE WHO ARE MANY OF THEM

01:52:28.174 --> 01:52:30.110
IMMIGRANTS THEY DON'T SPEAK.

01:52:30.176 --> 01:52:32.545
ENGLISH THEY'RE HARD WORKING

01:52:32.612 --> 01:52:34.247
FOLKS MANY OF THEM HAVE WORKED

01:52:34.314 --> 01:52:35.648
FOR YEARS FOR THESE VARIOUS

01:52:35.715 --> 01:52:40.086
COMPANIES- THEY DO- BUILDING

01:52:40.153 --> 01:52:43.256
MAINTENANCE AND SECURITY AND

01:52:43.323 --> 01:52:44.157
MANY OF THEM ARE

01:52:44.224 --> 01:52:45.925
OVERWHELMINGLY. THE WOMEN

01:52:45.992 --> 01:52:47.894
IMMIGRANT AND PEOPLE OF COLOR

01:52:47.961 --> 01:52:50.196
AND THIS DOES IS GIVE THEM

01:52:50.263 --> 01:52:51.531
FIRST DIBS AT RETURNING TO

01:52:51.598 --> 01:52:54.167
THEIR JOBS. THESE BUSINESSES

01:52:54.234 --> 01:52:56.302
REOPEN AND SHOULD NEW

01:52:56.369 --> 01:52:57.971
BUSINESSES ATTACK OVER IN THEIR

01:52:58.037 --> 01:53:00.106
PLACE AND IF THE CHAMBER WISHES

01:53:00.173 --> 01:53:02.308
US TO BE TRANSPARENT AND HONEST

01:53:02.375 --> 01:53:03.409
LOOK HE SAID PART OF THE REASON

01:53:03.476 --> 01:53:05.145
THEY'RE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL IS

01:53:05.211 --> 01:53:06.913
BECAUSE THEY'D LIKE TO DO SOME

01:53:06.980 --> 01:53:12.118
UNION BUSTING- AND- I THINK

01:53:12.185 --> 01:53:12.752
THAT WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT

01:53:12.819 --> 01:53:13.653
THE- REASON. THAT HAVE THIS

01:53:13.720 --> 01:53:16.789
BILL. IN THE FIRST PLACE THESE

01:53:16.856 --> 01:53:18.224
ARE PEOPLE WHO JUST SIMPLY WANT

01:53:18.291 --> 01:53:20.326
THEIR OBS BACK THEY WEREN'T

01:53:20.393 --> 01:53:22.729
FIRED BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T GOOD

01:53:22.795 --> 01:53:24.564
AT THEIR JOBS THEY LOST THEIR

01:53:24.631 --> 01:53:26.432
JOBS BECAUSE OF THIS PANDEMIC.

01:53:26.499 --> 01:53:28.301
AND THEY WOULD LIKE TO ENSURE

01:53:28.368 --> 01:53:30.637
THAT THEY HAVE FIRST DIBS AND

01:53:30.703 --> 01:53:31.838
GETTING THEIR JOBS. OUT WHEN

01:53:31.905 --> 01:53:33.940
AND IF THESE COMPANIES DESPITE

01:53:34.007 --> 01:53:35.775
TO REOPEN AND FRANKLY MOST OF

01:53:35.842 --> 01:53:38.144
THEM WILL HAVE TEN DAYS OR MORE%

01:53:38.211 --> 01:53:39.712
BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE

01:53:39.779 --> 01:53:42.815
TO RAMP UP- TO BE ABLE TO.

01:53:42.882 --> 01:53:44.918
COMPLY WITH EXISTING LAWS MAYBE

01:53:44.984 --> 01:53:47.253
A NEW PROTOCOL CONTROL FOUR

01:53:47.320 --> 01:53:50.089
CHARGE I FIND THOSE ARE. BE

01:53:50.156 --> 01:53:53.226
LESS THAN COMPELLING. YOU KNOW

01:53:53.293 --> 01:53:56.429
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT I THINK

01:53:56.496 --> 01:53:57.931
THAT WE LOOK TO THE PEOPLE

01:53:57.997 --> 01:54:00.133
BUSINESS CAN'T EXIST WITHOUT

01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:03.303
THE PEOPLE WHO DO THE WORK AND-

01:54:03.369 --> 01:54:05.905
IT'S REALLY- IT'S JUST NOT

01:54:05.972 --> 01:54:07.807
ENOUGH TO OFFER UNEMPLOYMENT

01:54:07.874 --> 01:54:09.576
INSURANCE WE WANT CALIFORNIANS

01:54:09.642 --> 01:54:11.277
WHO ARE JOBLESS TO THE EXTENT

01:54:11.344 --> 01:54:15.148
WERE ABLE TO GET BACK TO WORK

01:54:15.215 --> 01:54:16.382
WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT AND I

01:54:16.449 --> 01:54:17.817
BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT I WOULD DO

01:54:17.884 --> 01:54:19.819
FOR A SIGNATURE SEGMENT THE-

01:54:19.886 --> 01:54:22.355
NATION FRANKLY AND THIS. SOME

01:54:22.422 --> 01:54:26.626
PIECES OF THE BILL HAS TAKEN ON

01:54:26.693 --> 01:54:29.696
THE END OF BELIEVE UNDER THE

01:54:29.762 --> 01:54:32.899
CALIFORNIA FAMILY CHECKED. SURE

01:54:32.966 --> 01:54:33.433
IS THE RESULT OF THIS CALL

01:54:33.499 --> 01:54:35.468
PANDEMIC. WHERE PARENTS

01:54:35.535 --> 01:54:37.337
SUPPOSED TO DO THE KIDS ARE

01:54:37.403 --> 01:54:40.273
HOME I IN MANY INSTANCES

01:54:40.340 --> 01:54:41.608
THERE'S NO ONE ELSE TO CARE FOR

01:54:41.674 --> 01:54:44.544
THEM ARE THEY- WHAT DO WE DO

01:54:44.611 --> 01:54:46.145
LET SIX YEAROLD STAY HOME

01:54:46.212 --> 01:54:48.715
ALONE- BECAUSE PARENTS HAVE TO

01:54:48.781 --> 01:54:50.783
CHOOSE BETWEEN A JOB AND CARING

01:54:50.850 --> 01:54:52.252
FOR THEIR CHILDREN I THINK THIS

01:54:52.318 --> 01:54:54.020
IS A- VERY POOR. CHOICE IN A

01:54:54.087 --> 01:54:56.723
HOBSON'S CHOICE THAT. DOES NOT

01:54:56.789 --> 01:54:59.559
SPEAK WELL ABOUT WHAT WE AS A

01:54:59.626 --> 01:55:02.962
SOCIETY. HAVE DONE IN

01:55:03.029 --> 01:55:03.763
PRIORITIZING WHAT'S IN LIFE.

01:55:03.830 --> 01:55:08.635
THAT BEING SAID- THE- THE BILL

01:55:08.701 --> 01:55:13.273
ALSO. I THINK IT REMOVES THE

01:55:13.339 --> 01:55:14.741
EXTENDED REASONS FOR USING

01:55:14.807 --> 01:55:16.576
LEAVE A JURY THE DAY TOMORROW

01:55:16.643 --> 01:55:20.580
HE I ALSO WORK DID LEDGES. TO

01:55:20.647 --> 01:55:22.081
EXPAND LEAVE DURING THE SCHOOL

01:55:22.148 --> 01:55:24.817
CLOSURES ALSO FACED AN UPHILL

01:55:24.884 --> 01:55:27.820
BATTLE AND FRANKLY I'M

01:55:27.887 --> 01:55:29.522
CONCERNED THAT WE COULD AND-

01:55:29.589 --> 01:55:34.494
LEGISLATORS. WILL PUT ANY. LATE

01:55:34.560 --> 01:55:38.598
GOING WAS SCHOOL. STATE BURNING

01:55:38.665 --> 01:55:39.132
I AM VERY SURE CHILD CARE

01:55:39.198 --> 01:55:40.733
ISSUES THEY'RE REAL THIS IS NOT

01:55:40.800 --> 01:55:42.602
GOING AWAY AND YET ARE THIS NO

01:55:42.669 --> 01:55:46.105
DAY. WE SHOULD TAKE A PEOPLE TO

01:55:46.172 --> 01:55:48.408
BE ABLE TO GET THEIR JOBS BACK-

01:55:48.474 --> 01:55:50.943
INTERESTED TO ME IS SO CONTRARY

01:55:51.010 --> 01:55:53.946
TO THE PRINCIPLES OF. A TRYING

01:55:54.013 --> 01:55:54.647
TO GIVE EVERYBODY AN

01:55:54.714 --> 01:55:57.650
OPPORTUNITY TO SUCCEED I'M I'VE

01:55:57.717 --> 01:55:59.319
ALSO HEARD THE OPPOSITION SAY

01:55:59.385 --> 01:56:00.987
THEY DON'T LIKE A PRIVATE RIGHT

01:56:01.054 --> 01:56:02.488
OF ACTION THIS IS BINDLE

01:56:02.555 --> 01:56:05.358
STANDING A CHAMBER TALKING AND

01:56:05.425 --> 01:56:06.592
I THINK IT'S HIGH TIME WE CALL

01:56:06.659 --> 01:56:09.929
THIS THING OUT STRIP PRIVATE BY

01:56:09.996 --> 01:56:12.699
OF ACTION IS ALSO DENYING FULL

01:56:12.765 --> 01:56:15.234

YOU BUT I CERTAINLY DON'T

01:56:21.140 --> 01:56:22.375
BELIEVE WE SHOULD BE ASKING

IN IT'S ONE THAT SCARES PEOPLE

01:56:47.266 --> 01:56:49.635
AND I'M I'M SO DISAPPOINTED

01:56:49.702 --> 01:56:50.837
THAT WE DON'T CONSIDER THE FACT

01:56:50.903 --> 01:56:53.406

ENTITLED TO PROGRAM DIRECTOR I

03:31:32.179 --> 03:31:34.715
OVERSAW THE RESIDENCY PROGRAMS.

03:31:34.782 --> 03:31:36.417
AND PEDIATRICS OF UC DAVIS SELF

03:31:36.483 --> 03:31:38.152
I KNOW I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO

03:31:38.218 --> 03:31:39.453
SIT ON THAT SIDE TO ACTUALLY

03:31:39.520 --> 03:31:41.288
HAVE TO SIGN A LETTER SAYING

03:31:41.355 --> 03:31:42.656
THAT THE RESIDENTS HAVE

03:31:42.723 --> 03:31:44.291
COMPLETED THEIR TRAINING THAT

03:31:44.358 --> 03:31:44.892
THEY ARE READY FOR INDEPENDENT

03:31:44.958 --> 03:31:46.994
PRACTICE- YOU KNOW THIS IN

03:31:47.061 --> 03:31:48.262
THREE YEARS A VERY STRUCTURED

03:31:48.328 --> 03:31:50.798
TRAINING INTENSIVE TRAINING. TO

03:31:50.864 --> 03:31:54.535
PREPARE THEM FOR PRACTICE AND-

03:31:54.601 --> 03:31:57.137
SO CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND- SOME

03:31:57.204 --> 03:31:59.706
OF UC'S CONCERNS. BUT THE SAME

03:31:59.773 --> 03:32:03.944
TIME I ALSO NOTE THAT- ALL

03:32:04.011 --> 03:32:04.645
RESIDENTS ARE ON THE FRONT

03:32:04.711 --> 03:32:07.014
LINES- TAKING CARE OF PATIENTS-

03:32:07.081 --> 03:32:09.216
THEY ARE. YOU KNOW THE REASON

03:32:09.283 --> 03:32:10.050
THEY GET PAID IS BECAUSE

03:32:10.117 --> 03:32:11.552
THEY'RE FOR DELIVERING VALUABLE

03:32:11.618 --> 03:32:13.454
CLINICAL SERVICES AND CLINICAL

03:32:13.520 --> 03:32:15.956
SERVICES THAT. NAY THIS

03:32:16.023 --> 03:32:17.424
POSITIONS NOT ONLY THE LIVER

03:32:17.491 --> 03:32:18.792
BUT WE ACTUALLY TRAIN THEM TO

03:32:18.859 --> 03:32:19.960
BE ADVOCATES THE NEED TO BE

03:32:20.027 --> 03:32:21.061
ADVOCATES FOR THE PATIENTS WHEN

03:32:21.128 --> 03:32:22.729
YOU SEE A DOCTOR. YOU NEED TO

03:32:22.796 --> 03:32:24.698
KNOW THAT DOCTORS CAN BE

03:32:24.765 --> 03:32:25.299
ADVOCATING FOR YOU AND THAT'S

03:32:25.365 --> 03:32:25.833
PART OF THAT TRAINING AND

03:32:25.899 --> 03:32:27.101
SOCIALIZATION HAPPENS DURING

03:32:27.167 --> 03:32:29.169
RESIDENCY. AND WE NEED TO ALLOW

03:32:29.236 --> 03:32:29.837
THAT TO HAPPEN DURING

03:32:29.903 --> 03:32:32.106
RESIDENCY. AND ALSO THEY SHOULD

03:32:32.172 --> 03:32:34.741
NOT BE PUNISHED FOR DOING THAT

03:32:34.808 --> 03:32:35.776
AND SOMETIMES THAT MAKES THE

03:32:35.843 --> 03:32:37.611
INSTITUTION UNCOMFORTABLE.

03:32:37.678 --> 03:32:39.713
RIGHT BECAUSE THEY NEED TO NOT

03:32:39.780 --> 03:32:41.148
ONLY ADVOCATE FOR THEMSELVES

03:32:41.215 --> 03:32:41.715
AND FOR THEIR PATIENTS AND I

03:32:41.782 --> 03:32:44.451

03:32:51.558 --> 03:32:53.060
OF NOT JUST ABOUT WELL WHAT OUR

03:32:53.127 --> 03:32:54.661
OWN PAY AND SALARY SO FOR THE

03:32:54.728 --> 03:32:55.729
TALKED ABOUT THE WORKING

03:32:55.796 --> 03:32:57.131
CONDITIONS THAT ACTUALLY AFFECT

03:32:57.197 --> 03:32:58.966
PATIENT CARE. AND I THINK THAT

03:32:59.032 --> 03:33:00.067
IS IMPORTANT THEY HAVE THOSE

03:33:00.134 --> 03:33:04.505
PROTECTIONS. SO WITH THAT I

03:33:04.571 --> 03:33:05.105
KNOW SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY SAT

03:33:05.172 --> 03:33:07.341
ON THE SB SIX WHAT THE OTHER

03:33:07.407 --> 03:33:08.308

ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND IS

03:48:54.220 --> 03:48:55.988
THAT AS AS POINTED OUT BY THE

03:48:56.055 --> 03:49:00.093

HEALTHCARE SERVICES AND ALSO

03:49:02.628 --> 03:49:04.030

WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN THEY FILE

A COMPLAINT DO EITHER WAIT THEM

03:49:10.803 --> 03:49:12.905

03:49:12.972 --> 03:49:14.941
THEY'RE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE

03:49:15.007 --> 03:49:16.609
TO BECAUSE LANDS IS WHEN WE'RE

SOMEONE'S ADVANCEMENT IT'S NOT

03:49:18.978 --> 03:49:21.247
JUST THAT SOMEONE GOT A JOB AND

03:49:21.314 --> 03:49:23.249
THEY'RE NOT PROMOTED. THEY EAT

03:49:23.316 --> 03:49:24.650
THEY DON'T ADVANCE ESSENTIALLY

SOMEONE COULD FILE A COMPLAINT

DON'T THE PROGRAM ORDER DOWN

03:49:38.498 --> 03:49:40.266
THE CAREER. I THINK WE HAVE TO

03:49:40.333 --> 03:49:41.534
PUT THAT INTO CONTEXT TO WHAT

03:49:41.601 --> 03:49:43.269
