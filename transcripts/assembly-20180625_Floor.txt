ON MEDI CAL THE PROGRAM WILL BE FUNDED WITH PROP FIFTY SIX FUNDING THAT WE ARE ADDING TO THE BUDGET. ESTABLISHES A NEW DENTAL INTEGRATION PILOT PROGRAM IN SAN MATEO COUNTY IN NO COST PILOT THAT THE COUNTY HOPES WILL EXPAND. DENTAL ACCESS.

AND PHYSICIANS AND THIS PROGRAM SHOULD HELP INSURE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND UNDERSERVED PARTS OF CALIFORNIA HOWEVER WHEN WE'RE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE WILL NEVER. SOLVE THE PROBLEM. OF ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND UNDERSERVED PARTS OF CALIFORNIA UNTIL WE ARE WILLING. TO RAISE THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE FOR MEDI CAL PROVIDERS TO THE POINT WHERE IT IS POSSIBLE FOR A PHYSICIAN OR A DENTIST TO HAVE A PRACTICE IN RURAL CALIFORNIA.

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL -- MY BROTHER WENT THROUGH SUCH A PROGRAM IN NEW YORK YEARS AGO.

MEMBERS WITHOUT REFERENCE REFERENCE TO FILE MEAN WE'RE GOING TO BE TAKING UP. S. B. EIGHT FIFTY SIX CORKERY. SENATE BILL EIGHT FIFTY SIX BY THE COMMITTEE ON BUDGET AND FISCAL REVIEW AND ACTUALLY TO THE STATE BUDGET MAKING APPROPRIATIONS THEREFORE TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY BILL REALLY TO THE BUDGET. THE SHOOTING YOU MAKE AN OPEN I THINK YOU WOULD SPEAKER S. B. A FIFTY SIX OF THE COMPANION MEASURE TO S. B. EIGHT FOUR NINE WHICH WE JUST. PASSED THAT ALSO MAN'S THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT WHICH WAS SB EIGHT FORTY WHICH WAS PASSED ON JUNE FOURTEENTH. THE BILL ADDS THREE BILLION DOLLARS OF SPECIAL FUNDS IN FEDERAL FUNDS TO THE BUDGET ACT. WITHIN THAT IS ONE BILLION DOLLARS FOR PROP FIFTY SIX EXPENDITURES WHICH WE JUST DISCUSSED. FIVE HUNDRED MILLION OF THAT IS FOR THIS POSITION PROVIDERS THE BILL MENTAL PAYMENTS BY TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION FROM LOAN REPAYMENT ACT FOR QUALIFYING. RECENT GRADUATES EFFICIENT A DENTIST TO SERVE MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES. AND ALSO EXPANDS ONE POINT FOUR BILLION F. CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURES. TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS OF OTHER SPECIAL FUNDS TO FIGHT POLLUTION. THE MAJOR PROVISIONS INCLUDE THREE ENTERED A FIVE MILLION TO INVEST IN THE AIR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT ACTIVITIES. THAT IMPLEMENT ALL ACTED THAT IMPLEMENT A. B.. SIX ONE SEVEN ALSO MONEY FOR CLEAN VEHICLES IMPORTS OF ALMOST FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. A TWO HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR VARIOUS PROGRAMS FOR TO IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF OUR FORCE. IN REDUCING FIRE RISKS THREE HUNDRED AND FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOR INVESTMENTS IN AGRICULTURE. OUR IT ALSO IN ADDITION I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT IT DOES INCLUDE SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR ADDITIONAL D. M. V. STOPPING I KNOW. MANY OF OUR DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN HEARING ABOUT LONG DMV LINE SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE PUTTING IN. HE IMMEDIATELY TO HELP MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE CAN GET INTO DMV AND OUT OF DMB WITHOUT HAVING TO WAIT HOURS. I WOULD THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIGHT. THE ENGLISH TEN MISTER OBERNOLTE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER THIS TRAILER BILL IMPLEMENTS THE EXPENDITURE PLAN FOR CAP AND TRADE REVENUES. STATE LAW REQUIRES US TO SPEND THESE REVENUES ON REDUCTION OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND I THINK AS GOOD STEWARDS OF THAT'S TAXPAYER MONEY WE ARE OBLIGATED TO SPEND IT IN THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY THAT WE POSSIBLY CAN. FORTUNATELY FOR US EFFICIENCY IS VERY EASY TO MEASURE WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS IF YOUR LOOKING AT A PROGRAM YOU TAKE THE TOTAL COST OF THE PROGRAM. IN DOLLARS AND YOU DIVIDE BY THE NUMBER OF TONS OF CARBON THAT THAT PROGRAM REDUCES. AND THAT GIVES YOU THE COST OF REDUCING EACH TON OF CARBON. SO THOUGH THE LOWER THE COST OF REDUCTION THE HIGHER THE EFFICIENCY OF THE PROGRAM SO JUST FOR COMPARISON SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE FUNDED IN THIS TRAILER BILL ARE VERY EFFICIENT THINGS LIKE. HEALTHY FORESTS DAIRY DIE GESTURES ORGANIC RECYCLING. COST PER TON OF CARBON REDUCED FOR THOSE PROGRAMS IS UNDER TEN DOLLARS PER TON. HOWEVER THERE ARE OME VERY INEFFICIENT USES OF THE MONEY CONTAINED IN THIS TRAILER BILL FOR EXAMPLE THE CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROGRAM THAT'S ACOSTA OVER FORTY SIX DOLLARS PER TON OF CARBON REDUCED IN OTHER WORDS. THAT'S FOUR TIMES LESS EFFICIENT. I IN THEIR PROGRAMS LIKE THE CLEAN TRUCK AND BUS BELCHER INCENTIVE PROGRAM THAT HAVE A COST OF OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS PER TON OF CARBON. SO THAT'S OVER FORTY TIMES LESS EFFICIENT THAN THE MOST EFFICIENT USES IN THIS BILL. I TO PUT IT A DIFFERENT WAY MEMBERS WE COULD BE DOING A LOT BETTER JOB AT REDUCING CARBON WE COULD REDUCE MANY MORE TONS OF CARBON DIOXIDE THAN WE DO IN THIS TRAILER BILL. AND FOR THIS REASON I FEEL IT MUST BE OPPOSED ARJUN OVER. MISTER GRAYSON HERE RECOMMENDS THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB. EIGHT FIFTY SIX THIS APRIL OVER FIFTY MEMBERS FROM BOTH HOUSES SIGNED A LETTER WHICH CALLED ON THE GOVERNOR TO FUND COMMUNITY AIR MONITORING PROGRAMS. ESTABLISHED LAST YEAR BY AB SIX SEVENTEEN I AM PROUD TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THIS BILL INCLUDES FIFTY MILLION FOR QUALITY MONITORING THIS YEAR FOR AIR QUALITY MONITORING THIS YEAR.

TODAY I PRESENT ASSEMBLY CONCURRENT RESOLUTION. TO FIFTEEN THROUGH WHICH ARE LEGISLATURE CAN EXPRESS ITS SUPPORT FOR THE ASILOMAR PRINCIPLES AS GUIDING VALUES FOR THE VELDT DEVELOPMENT OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. IN JUST THE LAST FEW YEARS THE CAPABILITY OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE HAS REACH MILESTONES THAT SOME PREDICTED WERE EITHER UNACHIEVABLE OR STILL DECADES AWAY. PROVIDING A GLIMPSE OF THE UNBOUNDED POTENTIAL FOR ECONOMIC. AND SOCIAL IMPACT. IN MARCH OF TWENTY SIXTEEN GOOGLE DEEP MINES ALFA GO BEAT THE WORLD'S REIGNING GO CHAMPION. USING TACTICS THAT EXCEEDED AND SOPHISTICATION AND ELEGANCE STRATEGIES DEVELOPED OVER TWO MILLENNIA. OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE. IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN TESLA ANNOUNCED THAT ITS VEHICLES HAD COLLECTIVELY DRIVEN OVER THREE HUNDRED MILLION MILES USING AUTONOMOUS STEERING IN NAVIGATION. SURPASSING BY UP 240% THE SAFETY RECORD. OF HUMAN DRIVERS. I JUST LAST MONTH GOOGLE UNVEILED A NEW TYPE OF A AYE ASSISTANCE. WOULD USES LANGUAGE INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THAT OF A NATIVE SPEAKER TO MAKE RESERVATIONS BOOK FLIGHTS AND SCHEDULE MEETINGS OVER THE PHONE. NOW THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING. OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS POISED TO DISRUPT DOMAINS INCLUDE HEALTHCARE. LAW FINANCE MANUFACTURING EDUCATION EVEN GOVERNMENT. IN EACH AREA A AYE CARRIES THE POTENTIAL TO DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE. ECONOMIC PROSPERITY AND HUMAN WELL BEING. SO LONG AS IT IS DEVELOPED IN A MANNER THAT ENSURE SECURITY RELIABILITY AND CONSONANTS HUMAN VALUES. THE PURPOSE OF TODAY'S RESOLUTION. IS TO IDENTIFY A SET OF SHARED VALUES THE CAN UNDERPIN COOPERATION BETWEEN POLICYMAKERS A AYE RESEARCHERS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. AS WE WORK TOGETHER TO REALIZE THE PAST POSITIVE POTENTIAL OF ARTIFICIAL [inaudible] INTELLIGENCE. THE ASILOMAR PRINCIPLES ALL TWENTY THREE OF WHICH ARE SET FORTH IN TODAY'S RESOLUTION. WE'RE DEVELOP HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THEY GET THEIR NAME FROM THE CONVENTION SITE NEAR PACIFIC GROVE. WE'RE IN JANUARY OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE WORLD'S LEADING A AYE RESEARCHERS ECONOMISTS LEGAL SCHOLARS AND PHILOSOPHERS MET TO DISCUSS HOW BEST TO ENSURE A EYES DEVELOPS A PLEA. AND THAT THE COURT. THE PRINCIPLES ADOPTED AT THE IS STILL OUT OF CELLMARK STRESSED THE NEED FOR SAFETY. TRANSPARENCY PRIVACY AND ALIGNMENT WITH HUMAN VALUES. NOTABLY ONE OF THE PRINCIPLES PROVIDES THAT THERE SHOULD BE CONSTRUCTIVE AND HEALTHY EXCHANGE BETWEEN A AYE RESEARCHERS. AND POLICY MAKERS. ANOTHER STATES A THE APPLICATION OF A I THE PERSONAL DATA MUST NOT UNREASONABLY CURTAIL PEOPLE'S REAL OR PERCEIVED LOVER. AT ANOTHER SETS FORTH THE POWER CONFERRED BY CONTROL OF HIGHLY ADVANCED A AYE SYSTEMS SHOULD RESPECT AND IMPROVE RATHER THAN SUBVERTS. THE SOCIAL AND CIVIC PROCESSES AND WHICH THE HEALTH OF SOCIETY DEPENDS. THE ASYLUM ARE PRINCIPLES HAVE BEEN INDEPENDENTLY ENDORSED BY MORE THAN TWELVE HUNDRED LEADING EXPERTS IN THE FIELD OF A AYE. INCLUDING THE LATE STEPHEN HAWKING YOU ONE MOSQUE AND DENNIS ASADA'S FOUNDER OF DEEP MIGHT. THE RESOLUTION IS SPONSORED BY THE FUTURE OF LIFE INSTITUTE AN ORGANIZATION FOUNDED BY MIT PROFESSOR MAX TEGMARK AND UC SANTA CRUZ PROFESSOR ANTHONY AGUIRRE. IT'S COMMITTED A AYE SAFETY RESEARCH AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF BENEFICIAL A AYE. BY ENDORSING THESE PRINCIPLES TODAY WILL JOIN IN THE RECOGNITION OF SHARED VALUES THAT CAN BE APPLIED TO RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT AND LONG TERM PLANNING. HELPING TO REINFORCE CALIFORNIA'S COMPETITIVE EDGE IN THE FIELD OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WILL ASSURING THAT IT'S BENEFITS ARE MANIFOLD AND WIDESPREAD. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND THAT'S THE FIRST WILL BE OPEN FOR CO AUTHORS. THANK YOU MISS KILEY MISTER CALDERON. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY -- REYES ARISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS IS SOMETHING THAT WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY IN THIS. ON THE IN THIS BODY ARE THERE ARE DIFFERENT TYPES OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE OP COATED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WHERE YOU GIVE A COMMAND. AYE AND IT'S COATED TO GIVE YOU A CERTAIN TYPE OF RESPONSE AND THEN THERE'S A TON OF THIS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THAT ACTS ON ITS OWN AND RIGHT NOW THERE ARE COMPANIES THAT ARE. REALLY STRIVING TO BE THE LEADER IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WHAT THAT MEANS IS IS THAT THERE ARE NO BREAKS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ISN'T SOMETHING THAT THERE'S JUST AN ON OFF SWITCH. YOU LITERALLY AS A COMPANY COULD UNLEASH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE INTO OUR NETWORK AND ONCE IT'S GONE YOU CANNOT STOP IT ONCE IT'S THERE YOU CANNOT STOP IT FROM GOING ANYWHERE IN DOING ANYTHING. AND SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE LEGISLATURE RECOGNIZE THESE PRINCIPLES AND ADOPT THESE PRINCIPLES BUT ALSO TAKES IS REALLY SERIOUS LOOK OUT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. AND WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO TO REGULATE THAT FEEL UP BECAUSE AT SOME POINT IN ENTERPRISING COMPANY AN ENTERPRISING INDIVIDUAL COULD ONLY SOMETHING% THAT WE CANNOT STOP WE CAN NEVER TAKE BACK I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THIS LEGISLATURE TAKE THIS ISSUE. EXTREMELY SERIOUSLY AND WE HAVE A LOT OF REALLY CAPABLE AND ABLE MEMBERS THAT ARE ABLE TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE AND COME UP WITH SOME TYPE OF POLICY THAT NOT ONLY WORKS FOR CALIFORNIA BUT SERVES AS AN INTERNATIONAL MODEL A NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL MODEL. FOR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO FOLLOW AS WELL AS OTHER NATIONS AND SO I'M GLAD THAT MY COLLEAGUE RAISE THIS ISSUE AND BROUGHT THESE PRINCIPLES TO THE LEGISLATURE'S THAT WE COULD TAKE A VOTE ON IT AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

THIRTY FOUR BY MISTER EDUARDO GARCIA OF THE CLERK WILL READ. ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION THIRTY FOUR BY SOME THE MEMBER EDUARDO GARCIA AND OTHERS RELATIVE AGRICULTURAL LABOR SHORTAGES. MR GARCIA. THINGS SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES THIS MAY BE AN ISSUE THAT -- ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CANNOT ADDRESS. AGRICULTURE IS THE KEY CALIFORNIA INDUSTRY THAT EMPLOYS MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND FARMWORKERS ACCORDING TO A TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN UC DAVIS STUDY WITH CALIFORNIA. ET DE. CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ESTIMATES CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURE OUTPUT INCLUDES MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED COMMODITIES. GOING TO THE NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL SURVEY OVER 60% OF FARMWORKERS ARE UNAUTHORIZED AND VARIOUS SOURCES ESTIMATE THAT. THAT NUMBER COULD BE CLOSER IT DOES NOT AUTHORIZE WORKERS WERE TO BE DEPORTED IT COULD RESULT IN THE NATIONAL. WHITE FOOD SHORTAGE CRISIS WELL I BELIEVE THAT THE STATE SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO ADDRESS OUR OWN LABOR ISSUES. THE US CONSTITUTION MAKES IT EXPLICITLY CLEAR. THAT IMMIGRATION ISSUES ARE UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. TODAY'S FARMWORKERS ARE AGING. AND THEIR CHILDREN DON'T WANT TO DO THIS WORK. MEANWHILE THERE ARE FEWER IMMIGRANTS COMING TO THE COUNTRY TO REPLACE. THOSE INDIVIDUALS DOING THESE JOBS. THIS RESOLUTION WOULD PUT THE ISSUE OF LABOR SHORTAGES ON THE RADAR. OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND WOULD URGE CONGRESS TO ALLOW STATES TO ADDRESS THEIR OWN LABOR ISSUES MEMBERS. I THINK GOD THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DIVORCE. FROM THE CURRENT NATIONAL CONVERSATION HAPPENING IN WASHINGTON DC AS A RACE A COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM. AND CERTAINLY -- IMPOSSIBLE TO DIVORCE FROM THE CURRENT SITUATION AT THE BORDER. AS CALIFORNIA DEPENDS HEAVILY ON AGRICULTURE ECONOMY. AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE A STABLE WORKFORCE. I THINK NOW MORE THAN EVER WE OUGHT TO WEIGH IN HEAVILY. WHEN IT COMES TO THIS ISSUE THAT AGAIN CAN PRESENT IN NATIONAL FOOD CRISIS FOR THIS COUNTRY AND CERTAINLY FOR OUR STATE? THAT'S WHY I PRESENT TO YOU AJ ARE THIRTY FOUR AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER GARCIA. SEEING NO DISCUSSION OR DEBATE.

THE SEPTEMBER TWENTY NINETEEN DEADLINE TO LOSE TPS STATUS IS COMING UP SOON THRILLED SALVADORANS. A LITTLE OVER A YEAR IS NOT ENOUGH TIME FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS TO COMPLETELY CHANGE THEIR LIVES. IF THEY RETURNED EL SALVADOR THEY WOULD HAVE NO PLACE TO LIVE. JOBS TO EARN A LIVING BUT MOST. MOST OF ALL. THEY FOR THE VIOLENCE IN GANGS OF POLITICAL UNREST. HAVING FAMILY MEMBERS WHO SERVED IN THE MILITARY THEY FEAR FOR THEIR VERY LIVES IF THEY'RE FORCED TO RETURN. TPS HOLDERS OF ALREADY FULFILLED MANY OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR LAWFUL PERMANENT RESIDENTS. EVERY DAY THE DEMONSTRATE THEY BECOME FULL MEMBERS OF SOCIETY THROUGH EMPLOYMENT. HOMEOWNERSHIP AND THE RAISING OF STORY OF MY CONSTITUENT ILLUSTRATED. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD EXTEND TPS REAL SALVADOR HAITI HONDURAS NICARAGUA AND SUDAN WHILE ALSO WORKING TOWARD A PERMANENT SOLUTION. FOR RESIDENCY FOR EACH OF THEM.

DEPORTATIONS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DECADES OUR STATE IS HOME TO OVER FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND TPS RECIPIENTS MANY OF WHICH RESIDE. IN MY DISTRICT AND THE LARGER LOS ANGELES AREA. MANY TPS RECIPIENTS ARE ALSO PARENTS OF CHILDREN WHO ARE AMERICAN CITIZENS IF THEIR PARENTS ARE FORCED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES. WILL BE POTENTIALLY RIPPED APART AND THEIR CHILDREN LEFT WITH LEFT BEHIND WITHOUT MANY OPTIONS. BEAST DEPORTATIONS WILL COST OUR STATE THOUSANDS OF LAW ABIDING HARDWORKING RESIDENTS WHO PAY TAXES AND CONTRIBUTE MILLIONS. TO OUR ECONOMY.
