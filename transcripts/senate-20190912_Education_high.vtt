TRYING TO BALANCE OUR HOUSING

00:15:32.931 --> 00:15:33.499
TO I MEAN WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE

STUDENTS WHO. DON'T HAVE PLACE

00:15:35.167 --> 00:15:35.901
LET MOST OF WHAT WE DO HAVE

00:15:35.968 --> 00:15:36.702
STUDENTS HAVE NO PLACE TO LIVE

00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:38.871
AND THAT'S A PROBLEM. RIGHT AND

00:15:38.937 --> 00:15:41.173
SO I THINK IT'S PRAISE SOMEONE

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.808
CONTINGENT ON US AND I

00:15:42.875 --> 00:15:44.209

WHAT ARE THE SOLUTIONS WE HAVE

00:15:50.149 --> 00:15:52.184
ASIDE FROM DEVELOPER FEES THAT

00:15:52.251 --> 00:15:53.952
MAY ACTUALLY DISCOURAGE HOUSING

00:15:54.019 --> 00:15:56.188
CONSTRUCTION. TO HELP SUPPORT

00:15:56.255 --> 00:15:57.323
SCHOOL DISTRICTS BECAUSE

00:15:59.024 --> 00:16:01.193
STUDENTS WHO ARE LIVING YOU

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:01.827
NEED TO EDUCATE THEM SO WE'D BE

00:16:01.894 --> 00:16:04.029

THAT'S WE WANT TO LOOK AT

00:16:15.607 --> 00:16:17.276
QUALITY CONSTRUCTION AND I KNOW

00:16:17.343 --> 00:16:18.210
THAT PLA'S OF ACTUALLY

00:16:18.277 --> 00:16:20.012
GENERATED MORE OPPORTUNITIES

00:16:20.079 --> 00:16:21.814
FOR PEOPLE HERE AND AT LEAST IN

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.650
MY DISTRICT SO. I JUST I KNOW

00:16:24.717 --> 00:16:25.751
THAT WAS RAISED BY SOME

00:16:25.818 --> 00:16:27.853
OPPOSITION ABOUT THAT AND THEN

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.055
FINALLY I THINK IN TERMS OF THE

00:16:30.122 --> 00:16:32.958
HIGHER EDUCATION PIECE I THINK

00:16:33.025 --> 00:16:34.059
I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE IN THE

00:16:34.126 --> 00:16:35.828
COMMITTEE CERTAINLY VERY

00:16:35.894 --> 00:16:36.795
SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT'S IN THIS

00:16:36.862 --> 00:16:38.864
PLAN FOR HIGHER EDUCATION. BUT

00:16:38.931 --> 00:16:41.567
IN THE SAME IN SOME SENSES WE

00:16:41.633 --> 00:16:42.101
NEED TO COME OF THE MORE

00:16:42.167 --> 00:16:43.602
SYSTEMATIC WAY OF ALSO FOUND

00:16:43.669 --> 00:16:44.503
CUT AND WE'RE SO FAR BEHIND

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:45.804
THAT'S WHAT WE DID YOU KNOW WE

00:16:45.871 --> 00:16:47.906
NEED THIS BECAUSE WE ARE SO FAR

00:16:47.973 --> 00:16:52.511
BEHIND IN ALL OR THREE SYSTEMS

00:16:52.578 --> 00:16:53.112
I. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT ARE YOU

00:16:53.178 --> 00:16:57.683
SEE. AT A CSU AND OF COURSE

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:58.183
KEOGH COMMITTEE COLLEGE

00:16:58.250 --> 00:16:58.784
DISTRICT. SO WHILE CERTAINLY

00:16:58.851 --> 00:16:59.585
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. I THINK

00:16:59.651 --> 00:17:00.052
WE NEED TO LOOK MORE

00:17:00.119 --> 00:17:01.620
SYSTEMATICALLY BECAUSE I THINK

00:17:01.687 --> 00:17:02.888
THE LAST HIGHER EDUCATION BONDS

00:17:02.955 --> 00:17:04.923

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:06.291
THOUSAND AND SIX OKAY SUCH A

00:17:06.358 --> 00:17:08.427
LONG TIME AGO SO. WE NEED TO.

00:17:08.494 --> 00:17:10.129
ALSO TH EVEN THAT AFTER HE

00:17:10.195 --> 00:17:11.029
PASSED THE SPOT WE NEED TO

00:17:11.096 --> 00:17:12.331
THINK HOW WE DO THAT MORE

00:17:12.398 --> 00:17:13.399
SYSTEMATICALLY IN SOME COULD

00:17:13.465 --> 00:17:14.633
ARGUE ALSO THAT LITTLE BIT OF

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:16.034
K. TWELVE PASSED YOU MORE BONDS

00:17:16.101 --> 00:17:17.669
BUT- THINKING ABOUT. MORE

00:17:17.736 --> 00:17:19.238
SYSTEMATICALLY FUNDING OUR

00:17:19.304 --> 00:17:21.039
CAPITAL PROJECTS WITH THAT. I

00:17:21.106 --> 00:17:26.545
THINK IS NECESSARY VERY MUCH.

00:17:26.612 --> 00:17:27.146
MANAGER GET CAN I JUST COME IN

00:17:27.212 --> 00:17:30.783
YOUR MANAGER YES. TO PANIC

GOING FORWARD I'D BE HAPPY TO

00:17:31.717 --> 00:17:32.184
WORK WITH YOUNGER SENATOR

00:17:32.251 --> 00:17:32.785
GLAZERS WELL. TO LOOK AT OUR

00:17:32.851 --> 00:17:33.385
HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING MODEL

00:17:33.452 --> 00:17:34.319
FOR IT FOR THEIR FACILITIES.

00:17:34.386 --> 00:17:35.220
AND ALSO HOW IT'S APPLIED

00:17:35.287 --> 00:17:36.021
ACROSS THE SYSTEM AND EVEN ON

00:17:36.088 --> 00:17:37.656
EACH CAMPUS. I WALK THROUGH

00:17:37.723 --> 00:17:39.057
CAMPUS JUST ABOUT EVERY DAY.

00:17:39.124 --> 00:17:39.958
BOBBI STAY WHEN I'M AT HOME

00:17:40.025 --> 00:17:40.826
WITH THE DOG IN THE MORNING I.

00:17:40.893 --> 00:17:42.494
C. LE DISPARITY THERE SEE

00:17:42.561 --> 00:17:44.062
BUILDINGS THAT ARE. BRAND NEW

00:17:44.129 --> 00:17:45.431
SHINY. AND WHILE THAT DIDN'T

00:17:45.497 --> 00:17:46.432
SEEM TO ME THAT HAS THE HIGHEST

00:17:46.498 --> 00:17:48.300
PRIORITY AND THEN OTHERS ARE.

00:17:48.367 --> 00:17:49.034
IN THE CLASSROOMS AND LOOK THE

00:17:49.101 --> 00:17:50.302
SAME WAY THEY DID WHEN I WAS

00:17:50.369 --> 00:17:51.603
THERE THIRTY FIVE. THIRTY YEARS

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:53.338
AGO WHATEVER WAS. THIRTY YEARS

00:17:53.405 --> 00:17:56.508
AGO SO I'M I THINK THAT IS

00:17:56.575 --> 00:17:57.142
SOMETHING THAT IS WAS WORTHY OF

00:17:57.209 --> 00:18:00.813
DISCUSSION. MY RESPONSE. THE

00:18:00.879 --> 00:18:01.380
LAST ADMINISTRATION REALLY

00:18:01.447 --> 00:18:03.282
BROKE WITH TRADITION. AND

00:18:03.348 --> 00:18:05.184
RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON THESE

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:05.651
TYPES OF CAPITAL BOND

00:18:05.717 --> 00:18:08.420
SYSTEMATICALLY OVERTIME. OR IN

00:18:08.487 --> 00:18:09.855
THE OLD DAYS THE OLD COPY FUND.

00:18:09.922 --> 00:18:13.725
WHICH WAS OIL. REVENUE THEY

00:18:13.792 --> 00:18:15.694
RELIED UPON INTERNAL BORROWING.

00:18:15.761 --> 00:18:17.763
THAT WILL. WAS IF IT WAS TO

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:18.897
CONTINUE PUT PRESSURE ON

00:18:18.964 --> 00:18:19.898
TUITION INCREASES AND IT WAS

00:18:19.965 --> 00:18:21.400
SOMETHING I WAS VERY MUCH

00:18:21.467 --> 00:18:22.835
OPPOSED TO DURING THAT TIME AND

00:18:22.901 --> 00:18:24.403
SO WE HAD KIND OF A FREEZE. BUT

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:26.972
I THINK YOU'RE YOUR COMMENTS

00:18:27.039 --> 00:18:27.506
ARE WELL TAKEN AND I WOULD

00:18:27.573 --> 00:18:28.140
SUPPORT CONTINUING WORK ON THAT

00:18:28.207 --> 00:18:32.511

00:18:37.649 --> 00:18:40.052
USE OF THE OF THE FUNDS IS A

00:18:40.118 --> 00:18:41.920
REALLY GREAT THINGS THAT HE

00:18:41.987 --> 00:18:42.855
PROBABLY WOULD NEVER HAVE SEEN

00:18:42.921 --> 00:18:45.491
IN THE IN THE PAST. BUT THERE'S

00:18:45.557 --> 00:18:48.660
SO MANY THINGS I WONDER IN HOW

FOR PRESCHOOL WITH SUCH A SUCH

00:19:02.975 --> 00:19:06.378
A FOCUS THERE. BUT ALSO HEALTH

00:19:06.445 --> 00:19:08.747
AND SAFETY STUDENT HOUSING ON

00:19:08.814 --> 00:19:11.250

00:19:15.153 --> 00:19:17.523
THE BOTTOM OF HAVING AN IMPACT

00:19:17.589 --> 00:19:19.424
WHEN IT SPREAD OUT IN SO MANY

00:19:19.491 --> 00:19:21.593
DIFFERENT WAYS. WELL FIRST WHAT

ESTABLISH A TO BE HARD TO WRITE

00:19:32.204 --> 00:19:34.106
WILL HAVE TO ESTABLISH A NEED

00:19:34.172 --> 00:19:35.107
AND IT'S VERY TECHNICAL

00:19:35.173 --> 00:19:36.174
PROCESS. THEY ALSO HAVE TO WANT
