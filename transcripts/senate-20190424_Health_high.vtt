COVERAGE WE USUALLY ARE UNABLE

00:06:21.414 --> 00:06:23.015
TO GET CLEAR DECISIONS IN TIME.

00:06:23.082 --> 00:06:25.318

PROCEDURES PRIOR TO THE START OF

00:06:28.154 --> 00:06:29.756
THEIR CANCER TREATMENT.

00:06:29.822 --> 00:06:31.290
WHY IS THIS HERE SO IMPORTANT

00:06:31.357 --> 00:06:32.792
RECENT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN MANY

00:06:32.859 --> 00:06:34.160
PATIENTS ARE SO COMPARTE SO

00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:36.095
CONCERNED ABOUT FUTURE

00:06:36.162 --> 00:06:36.829

00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:38.297
THAT THEY MAY NOT CHOOSE THE

00:06:39.665 --> 00:06:41.200

STOP THEIR TAMOXIFEN EARLY.

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.475
DUE TO FERTILITY CONCERNS WHEN

FERTILITY PRESERVATION.

00:06:53.546 --> 00:06:55.414
SO WHILE WE HAVE KNOWN FOR A

00:06:55.481 --> 00:06:57.049
LONG TIME THAT PATIENTS LEFT

00:06:57.116 --> 00:06:58.618

00:07:09.896 --> 00:07:11.230
WORSE OUTCOMES.

00:07:11.297 --> 00:07:12.365
SB SIX HUNDRED WILL CLEAR FIVE

00:07:12.431 --> 00:07:13.099
EXISTENCE OF COVERAGE FOR

00:09:28.734 --> 00:09:32.371
INHERENT PRESSURES IN AN

INVOLVING MARKET -- YOU KNOW THE

00:09:34.507 --> 00:09:35.274
TOTALITY OFTHE MANDATES BEFORE

SEVERAL MILLION DOLLARS -- AND

00:09:39.946 --> 00:09:40.646
SO YOU KNOW THE COST OF THE

00:09:40.713 --> 00:09:41.480

00:09:41.547 --> 00:09:43.249
CONSIDERATIONS FOR CONSUMERS

00:09:43.316 --> 00:09:45.484
WHEN THEY'RE SELECTING A PLAN.

00:09:45.551 --> 00:09:46.819
I'M IN THE SO FAR CALIFORNIA'S

00:09:46.886 --> 00:09:48.321

00:09:48.387 --> 00:09:49.755
TO MOST OTHER STATES IN KEEPING

00:09:49.822 --> 00:09:51.524
COVERAGE AFFORDABLE -- BUT WE

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:53.259
STILL HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT

00:09:53.326 --> 00:09:55.461
AFFORDABILITY -- AND WE FEEL

00:09:55.528 --> 00:09:58.264

00:10:02.668 --> 00:10:02.935
LOW.

00:10:03.002 --> 00:10:03.469
SO A COMBINATION OF THESE

00:10:03.536 --> 00:10:04.870
FACTORS CONSUMER PRICE

00:10:04.937 --> 00:10:06.672
SENSITIVITY AND EXCEEDING.

00:10:06.739 --> 00:10:07.440
YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY EXCEEDING

00:10:07.506 --> 00:10:08.774
THE ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS

00:10:08.841 --> 00:10:10.776
MAKE IT A PART PARTICULARLY BAD

00:10:10.843 --> 00:10:11.444
TIME TO PASS NEW BENEFIT

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:12.411
MANDATES.

00:10:12.478 --> 00:10:16.315
AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE

00:10:16.382 --> 00:10:20.186
RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS BILL.

00:10:20.252 --> 00:10:20.853

THIS TABLE AND IN THIS ROOM

00:10:27.426 --> 00:10:28.494

00:10:33.499 --> 00:10:35.334
UNFORTUNATELY WE DO HAVE A LOT

00:10:35.401 --> 00:10:36.335
OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR

00:10:36.402 --> 00:10:38.204

PATIENTS AND INCLUDE OTHER

00:10:39.271 --> 00:10:41.607
INSTANCES FOR WHICH THEY WOULD

00:10:41.674 --> 00:10:42.441
BE SEEKING TREATMENT.

00:10:42.508 --> 00:10:44.410
WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE

00:10:44.477 --> 00:10:45.244
LENGTH OF COVERAGE ENERGY BURKE

00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:46.145
TALKED ABOUT A ONE YEAR OF

00:10:46.212 --> 00:10:48.447
STORAGE WE CERTAINLY DON'T THINK

00:10:48.514 --> 00:10:50.549
THAT THAT'S PROBABLY A REALISTIC.

00:10:50.616 --> 00:10:52.018
EXPECTATION SO WE WOULD HAVE

00:10:52.084 --> 00:10:53.486
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT WOULD

00:10:53.552 --> 00:10:55.388
HAPPEN TO ABANDON EMBRYOS WHAT

00:10:55.454 --> 00:10:57.256
WOULD BE THE LENGTH OF SERVICE

00:10:57.323 --> 00:10:58.924
AND THE GENERAL COST.

00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.159
IS IF YOU LOOKING EVIDENCES OF

00:12:40.226 --> 00:12:41.494
COVERAGE WHAT YOU'LL SEE IS

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:42.428
INFERTILITY.

00:12:42.495 --> 00:12:43.963
AND INFERTILITY IS MOST OFTEN

00:12:44.029 --> 00:12:45.397
NOT COVERED.

00:12:45.464 --> 00:12:46.298
SO THERE'S A BEEN A CONFUSION

00:12:46.365 --> 00:12:47.533
ABOUT FERTILITY PRESERVATION

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.301
UNDERSTANDABLY MOST PEOPLE DON'T

00:12:49.368 --> 00:12:50.469
KNOW THE PROVISION.

00:12:50.536 --> 00:12:51.370
AND FERTILITY PRESERVATION AND

00:12:51.437 --> 00:12:53.772
JUST TO BACK UP THE DAMAGE THE

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:57.243
ORDER.

00:12:57.309 --> 00:12:58.144
AGAINST ONE OF THE PLANS IS

00:12:58.210 --> 00:12:58.878
FEELING TO PAY.

00:12:58.944 --> 00:12:59.778
OKAY.

00:12:59.845 --> 00:13:01.313
SO THEY ARE CONVINCED IT IS

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:03.149
COVERED BENEFIT OKAY I'M GLAD I

00:13:03.215 --> 00:13:05.117
MEAN I'M NOT SAYING I'M GLAD YOU

00:13:05.184 --> 00:13:06.952
CAN FIND BECAUSE I CAN FIND IT

00:13:07.019 --> 00:13:13.626
AND AND MY STAFF CAN FIND I

00:13:13.692 --> 00:13:19.064
APPRECIATE STAFF.

00:13:19.131 --> 00:13:22.568
IS THERE CAN I AM CAN HEALTH

00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:24.403
PLANS RESPOND PLEASE IF -- YOU

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:25.204
KNOW MY MEMBERS ARE FIRMLY

00:13:25.271 --> 00:13:26.472
BELIEVE THAT THERE IS NO STATUTE

00:13:26.539 --> 00:13:28.340
REQUIRING THIS COVERAGE THERE'S

00:13:28.407 --> 00:13:29.842
BEEN NO REGULATIONS ISSUED BY

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:32.077

00:13:32.144 --> 00:13:32.878
REGARDING THIS COVERAGE AND A

00:13:32.945 --> 00:13:34.213
BILL IN TWO THOUSAND AND

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:37.850

PRESERVE FERTILITY WHERE

00:13:42.121 --> 00:13:42.788
POSSIBLE SUCH COVERAGE WAS NOT

00:13:42.855 --> 00:13:43.689
INCLUDED IN THE ESSENTIAL HEALTH

00:13:43.756 --> 00:13:44.657
BENEFITS THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:13:44.723 --> 00:13:45.090
PASSED.

00:13:45.157 --> 00:13:46.525
A FOR INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE AND

00:13:46.592 --> 00:13:48.861
SMALL GROUP COVERAGE.

00:13:48.928 --> 00:13:51.530

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:15.788
I THINK THOSE SOLAR I I THINK

00:14:15.854 --> 00:14:17.056
IT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND WHAT

00:14:17.122 --> 00:14:18.691
THE ADVANCES IN FERTILITY.

00:14:18.757 --> 00:14:21.126
HARVESTING EGGS IS BECOME JUST A

00:14:21.193 --> 00:14:23.162
SUCCESSFUL -- AND SO MORE AND

00:14:23.229 --> 00:14:25.898
MORE FERTILITY EFFORTS ARE ARE

00:14:25.965 --> 00:14:27.900
ARE EIGHT BASED AS OPPOSED TO

00:14:27.967 --> 00:14:29.835
EMBRYO BASED MENU IF YOU WANT TO

00:14:29.902 --> 00:14:30.202

ON THE TO SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.049
THE MANDATE WE WERE LOOKING TO

00:14:44.116 --> 00:14:45.751
ADD THIS AS COVERAGE BECAUSE IT

00:14:45.818 --> 00:14:47.953
WAS NOT YET THE STANDARD OF CARE.

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:49.021
AND THAT'S WHEN WE WERE LOOKING

00:14:49.088 --> 00:14:50.489

IN THE INTERIM IT HAS BECOME THE

00:14:52.258 --> 00:14:53.492
STANDARD OF CARE WE WERE

00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:54.326
THINKING ABOUT DOING ANOTHER

00:14:54.393 --> 00:14:56.395
BILL ACTUALLY MEANT THE

00:14:56.462 --> 00:14:57.529
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE HE SAID WELL

00:14:57.596 --> 00:14:58.163
NOW THAT IT IS THE STANDARD OF

00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:59.331
CARE IT MEETS THE CRITERIA FOR

00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:00.366
BEING MEDICALLY NECESSARY.

00:15:00.432 --> 00:15:02.635
AND YOU DO NOT NEED A SPECIFIC

00:15:02.701 --> 00:15:04.069
STATUTE.

00:15:04.136 --> 00:15:07.806
THAT'S ACTUALLY WITH SB ONE

00:15:07.873 --> 00:15:08.374

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:08.707
ACTUALLY STE.

00:15:08.774 --> 00:15:09.508
PAUSE TO THE BILL BECAUSE WE

00:15:09.575 --> 00:15:11.477
DIDN'T THINK WE NEEDED IT WE

00:15:11.543 --> 00:15:12.811
JUST IN PARTICULARLY MS ROENICKE

00:15:12.878 --> 00:15:14.346
WORKED ON VERY HARD WITH THE

00:15:14.413 --> 00:15:16.081
DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE.

00:15:16.148 --> 00:15:17.283
TO HAND WALK THESE PATIENTS

00:15:17.349 --> 00:15:19.485
THROUGH THE INDEPENDENT MEDICAL

00:15:19.551 --> 00:15:23.489
REVIEW PROCESS AND EVERY SINGLE

ONE OF THE CANCER PATIENTS.

00:15:25.991 --> 00:15:28.694
THEIR DENIAL WAS OVERTURNED BUT

00:15:28.761 --> 00:15:30.229
THE ONLY PATIENTS WHO COULD GO

00:15:30.296 --> 00:15:31.530
THROUGH THAT PROCESS WERE THOSE

00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:33.465
WHO WERE ABLE TO PAY FOR THE

00:15:33.532 --> 00:15:34.099
SERVICES UP FRONT.

00:15:34.166 --> 00:15:35.968
AND GET REIMBURSED BECAUSE THIS

00:15:36.035 --> 00:15:37.569
COULD TAKE WEEKS OR MONTHS TO

00:15:37.636 --> 00:15:45.444
GET RESOLVED AND SOMEBODY MIGHT

00:15:45.511 --> 00:15:47.313
LITERALLY HAVE.

00:15:47.379 --> 00:15:49.415

ESTABLISH KERR SO AS WE WERE IT

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:06.365

STATE.

00:38:50.361 --> 00:38:51.462
SB TWO SEVENTY SIX DOES JUST

00:38:51.529 --> 00:38:53.197
THAT IT REMOVES THE ABILITY FOR

STEP WHO LOOK WHO CAME BEFORE US.

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:06.944
UNFORTUNATELY A HANDFUL OF OUR

00:39:07.011 --> 00:39:08.946
CARLY'S WHO BRAZENLY ADVERTISE

00:39:09.013 --> 00:39:10.081
THE SALE OF MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS

00:39:10.147 --> 00:39:12.550
VACCINATIONS ARE NOT LIVING UP

00:39:12.616 --> 00:39:13.484

00:39:13.551 --> 00:39:16.320

RECEIVE VACCINATIONS.

00:39:25.496 --> 00:39:27.465
THE FACT THAT MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS

00:39:27.531 --> 00:39:28.132
FOR VACCINATIONS HAVE MORE THAN

00:39:28.199 --> 00:39:29.734
TRIPLED.

CANNOT BE RECENTLY EXPLAINED.

00:39:31.135 --> 00:39:32.770
THAT IS BECAUSE MOST OF US IT IS

00:39:32.837 --> 00:39:34.338
A MORAL THAT A SMALL HANDFUL OF

00:39:34.405 --> 00:39:36.240
PHYSICIANS ARE ALLOWING PARENTS

00:39:36.307 --> 00:39:38.275
TO PURCHASE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS.

00:39:38.342 --> 00:39:39.610
FOR THEIR CHILDREN WHO SHOULD

00:39:39.677 --> 00:39:40.845
OTHERWISE BE VACCINATED.

00:39:40.911 --> 00:39:42.313
THERE IS NO REASON FOR ONE

00:39:42.379 --> 00:39:43.714
PHYSICIAN TO WRITE A THIRD OF

00:39:43.781 --> 00:39:45.549

NEVER ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN AND

00:39:50.221 --> 00:39:52.256
WE SHOULD ACT TO PUT THE STOP TO

00:39:52.323 --> 00:39:53.657
THIS UNSCRUPULOUS BEHAVIOR.

00:39:53.724 --> 00:39:55.292
THESE PRACTITIONERS UNDERMINE

00:39:55.359 --> 00:39:56.694

00:40:01.632 --> 00:40:02.133
NUMBER OF PATIENTS WHO TRULY

I AM SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE

00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:51.587
THIS BILL.

00:59:51.654 --> 00:59:52.889
BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THE

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PATIENT

00:59:54.657 --> 00:59:56.025

NOT A GOVERNMENTAL APPOINTEE.

01:00:02.865 --> 01:00:04.133
THIS BILL WILL ESSENTIALLY

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:06.135
DESTROY THE SANCTITY OF THE

01:00:08.404 --> 01:00:09.572
LIKE MY COLLEAGUES I HAVE

01:00:09.639 --> 01:00:11.140
WITNESSED CASE IS A VACCINE

01:00:11.207 --> 01:00:13.176

DEVASTATING NEUROLOGICAL ILLNESS.

01:00:15.845 --> 01:00:18.281

01:00:19.916 --> 01:00:21.718
MAKE UP OF OUR PATIENTS WHEN

ADMINISTERING VACCINES TO

01:00:24.287 --> 01:00:25.521
PREVENT VACCINE INJURY.

01:00:25.588 --> 01:00:27.724
SHOULD THIS BILL BE PASSED THE

01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:28.591
MEDICAL DECISION OF WHETHER OR

01:00:28.658 --> 01:00:30.526
NOT VACCINATING WILL BE SAFE

01:00:30.593 --> 01:00:32.061
WILL NO LONGER BE IN THE HANDS

01:00:32.128 --> 01:00:33.396
OF THE PHYSICIANS.

01:00:33.463 --> 01:00:35.331
INSTEAD A PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIAL

01:00:35.398 --> 01:00:36.799
WITH MINIMAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE

01:00:36.866 --> 01:00:38.601
PATIENT WILL BE FORCED TO

01:00:38.668 --> 01:00:40.837
DETERMINE SAFETY USING ONLY THE

01:00:40.903 --> 01:00:42.672
CDC GUIDELINES FOR CONTRA

01:00:42.739 --> 01:00:44.173
INDICATIONS AND PRECAUTIONS.

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:46.175
THESE GUIDELINES ARE TOO NARROW

01:00:46.242 --> 01:00:48.177
AND DO NOT INCLUDE ALL POSSIBLE

01:00:48.244 --> 01:00:49.746

DISORDERS VULNERABLE.

01:00:52.615 --> 01:00:53.683
THAT IS WHY THIS BILL IS

01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:55.651
CALCULATED TO INCREASE VACCINE

01:00:55.718 --> 01:00:57.387
INJURIES ESPECIALLY AMONG

01:00:57.453 --> 01:01:00.156
MEDICALLY COMPLEX CASES.

01:01:14.237 --> 01:01:15.838
DETERMINATION OF CARE.

01:01:15.905 --> 01:01:17.106
THE DOCTOR IS IN THE BEST

01:01:17.173 --> 01:01:18.474

01:01:22.111 --> 01:01:23.546
IF NEEDED.

01:01:23.613 --> 01:01:25.348
THE TRUTH IS THERE IS NO REAL

01:01:25.415 --> 01:01:27.050
PROBLEM AND THIS BILL ISN'T

01:01:27.116 --> 01:01:29.218
NECESSARY VACCINE EXEMPTIONS

01:01:29.285 --> 01:01:30.586

TO PROVIDE HER COMMUNITY.

01:01:37.093 --> 01:01:38.261
AND THE CONCERN FOR POSSIBLE

01:01:38.327 --> 01:01:39.729
FRAUDULENT MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS IS

01:01:39.796 --> 01:01:41.898

OUT IN THE VOICE OF SAN DIEGO --

04:17:11.415 --> 04:17:13.551
INVESTIGATION OF THE TOP WRITERS

04:17:13.618 --> 04:17:14.485
AND MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS WERE

04:17:14.552 --> 04:17:16.554
PEOPLE WHO WERE ADVERTISING FOR

THE PEOPLE WHO TRULY HAVE A

04:17:25.696 --> 04:17:27.198

THOSE OF MEAT AND THEIR CHILDREN

04:17:30.701 --> 04:17:33.204

04:17:33.271 --> 04:17:34.772
IN YOUR VIEW -- IS A GOOD

04:17:34.839 --> 04:17:37.475
MEDICAL PRACTICE.

04:17:37.542 --> 04:17:39.477
TO PROVIDE AN EXEMPTION WITHOUT.

04:17:39.544 --> 04:17:41.612
MEETING WITH THE PATIENT.

04:17:41.679 --> 04:17:42.413
CERTAINLY YOU SHOULD BE MEETING

04:17:42.480 --> 04:17:43.648
WITH THE PATIENT ARE ACTS OF

04:17:43.714 --> 04:17:44.816
REGIONAL EXPECTATION WOULD BE

04:17:44.882 --> 04:17:46.450
THE CHILD'S PHYSICIAN WHO'D BE

04:17:46.517 --> 04:17:48.052

04:17:48.119 --> 04:17:49.187
EXEMPTION THEY SHOULD.

04:17:49.253 --> 04:17:50.621
CERTAINLY NOT BE SELLING THEM

04:17:50.688 --> 04:17:52.256

04:17:52.323 --> 04:17:53.925
PHYSICIANS TOO MANY IN MY HEART

04:17:53.991 --> 04:17:55.026

MEDICAL EXAMS AS THE PATIENTS

04:17:58.763 --> 04:18:00.164
THAT FOR THAT'S THE ONLY REASON

04:18:00.231 --> 04:18:02.066
THEY'RE QUITE SEEN THEM?

04:18:02.133 --> 04:18:04.402
FOR AND THAT'S NOT WHAT THE

04:18:04.468 --> 04:18:05.369
SHOULD BE HAPPENING.

04:18:05.436 --> 04:18:07.572
SO THANK YOU IN IN MY DISTRICT

04:18:07.638 --> 04:18:11.075
FROM. THIRTY ONE SCHOOLS FALL

04:18:11.142 --> 04:18:15.313
UNDER THE 95% VACCINATION RATE

04:18:15.379 --> 04:18:18.549
SOME DRAMATICALLY BELOW THAT IS

04:18:18.616 --> 04:18:19.917
CLOSE 70%.

04:18:19.984 --> 04:18:21.018
FROM.

04:18:21.085 --> 04:18:22.486
MY QUESTION I GUESS FOR THE

04:18:22.553 --> 04:18:24.789
OPPONENTS FIRST AND THEN I HAVE

04:18:24.856 --> 04:18:25.790
SOME QUESTIONS FOR THE

04:18:25.857 --> 04:18:29.026
PROPONENTS -- FOR THE OPPONENTS

04:18:29.093 --> 04:18:31.963
SOME IS THERE A PARENT IN THE

04:18:32.029 --> 04:18:34.098
OPPONENTS GROUP.

04:18:34.165 --> 04:18:36.567
NOW LET ME AS ONE OF THE DOCTORS

04:18:36.634 --> 04:18:41.772
THEN -- IS IT FROM.

04:18:41.839 --> 04:18:44.308
OKAY WELL AS PARENTS AS DOCTORS

04:18:44.375 --> 04:18:44.609
[inaudible]

04:18:44.675 --> 04:18:49.847
IS AN NINE THE IMMUNIZED CHILD.

04:18:49.914 --> 04:18:52.783
SAFER IN A CLASSROOM WHERE OTHER

04:18:52.850 --> 04:18:56.287
STUDENTS ARE IMMUNIZED.

04:18:56.354 --> 04:18:58.322
WHERE IS SEEN NINE IMMUNIZE

04:18:58.389 --> 04:19:00.858
STUDENT?

04:19:00.925 --> 04:19:02.994
SAFER IN A CLASSROOM WHERE THE

04:19:03.060 --> 04:19:04.762
OTHER STUDENTS HAVE BEEN

04:19:04.829 --> 04:19:08.399
IMMUNIZED.

04:19:08.466 --> 04:19:10.201
THAT'S MY QUESTION.

04:19:10.268 --> 04:19:12.703
THE PLEASE AS THE QUESTION.

04:19:12.770 --> 04:19:15.139
WELL I SEEN THAT BACKS.

04:19:15.206 --> 04:19:16.440
TRANSACTION IS NOT ALWAYS A 100%

04:19:16.507 --> 04:19:19.277
IF YOU LOOK AT AT THIS MOMENT A

04:19:19.343 --> 04:19:22.513
LOT OF THE VACCINE.

04:19:22.580 --> 04:19:24.615
SPREADING AT YOU KNOW IN IN THE

04:19:24.682 --> 04:19:26.617
SCHOOLS -- NINETY FOUR IS THERE

04:19:26.684 --> 04:19:27.952
ANY CIRCUMSTANCE I MEAN ASK IT

04:19:28.019 --> 04:19:28.786
THIS WAY.

04:19:28.853 --> 04:19:31.722
IS THERE ANY CIRCUMSTANCE.

04:19:31.789 --> 04:19:35.826
IN WHICH AN NINE IMMUNIZE CHILD.

04:19:35.893 --> 04:19:38.095
WOULD BE BETTER PROTECTED IN A

04:19:38.162 --> 04:19:39.163
CLASSROOM WHERE THE OTHER

04:19:39.230 --> 04:19:40.898
STUDENTS.

04:19:40.965 --> 04:19:43.267
HAVE BEEN IMMUNIZED.

04:19:43.334 --> 04:19:44.936
THAT CERTAINLY CAN BE TRUE AND

04:19:45.002 --> 04:19:47.138
AT THE SAME TIME BUT MAJORITY OF

04:19:47.204 --> 04:19:49.006
THE VACCINE THE MAJORITY THE

04:19:49.073 --> 04:19:50.474
DISEASES THAT ARE SPREADING

04:19:50.541 --> 04:19:51.742
RIGHT NOW THE SCHOOLS.

04:19:51.809 --> 04:19:53.077
HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE

04:19:53.144 --> 04:19:54.078
IMMUNIZATION RATES.

04:19:54.145 --> 04:19:56.247
BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAVE A NINETY

04:19:56.314 --> 04:19:58.382
SIX POINT 5% IMMUNIZATION RATE.

04:19:58.449 --> 04:19:59.784
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE WHAT WEST

04:19:59.850 --> 04:20:01.385
LIKE HARVARD YOU KNOW --

04:20:01.452 --> 04:20:05.589
PROCESSES OUTBREAK 1100% OF ALL

04:20:05.656 --> 04:20:07.124
THE CHILDREN.

04:20:07.191 --> 04:20:09.460
HAD FULL IMMUNIZATION AND THE

04:20:09.527 --> 04:20:10.995
EIGHTEEN STUDENTS THAT WERE NOT

04:20:11.062 --> 04:20:12.496
UNIONIZED DID NOT.

04:20:12.563 --> 04:20:13.931
CATCH THE DISEASE SO AT THAT YOU

04:20:13.998 --> 04:20:15.666
KNOW TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION.

04:20:15.733 --> 04:20:16.500
IT'S NOT.

04:20:16.567 --> 04:20:19.503
IT'S NOT THAT YOU ARE IMMUNIZED

04:20:19.570 --> 04:20:21.539
OR NOT EVEN AS MANY TIMES.

04:20:21.605 --> 04:20:23.074
WHETHER REGARDLESS OF YOUR

04:20:23.140 --> 04:20:24.709
VACCINE STATUS.

04:20:24.775 --> 04:20:27.812
WE HAVE NOT SEEN THAT.

04:20:27.878 --> 04:20:29.947
THAT THAT PROTECTION IS THERE

04:20:30.014 --> 04:20:32.016
THANK YOU WE HEARD FROM A LOT OF

04:20:32.083 --> 04:20:33.517
PARENTS TODAY.

04:20:33.584 --> 04:20:35.086
WHO TOOK PRIDE IN THE FACT THAT

04:20:35.152 --> 04:20:36.087
THEIR CHILDREN WERE NOT

04:20:36.153 --> 04:20:40.524
IMMUNIZED -- WITH THEIR CHILDREN

04:20:40.591 --> 04:20:41.959
BE AT GREATER RISK IF THEY

04:20:42.026 --> 04:20:44.195
TRAVELED TO A DEVELOPING NATION

04:20:44.261 --> 04:20:47.765
WHERE THERE WAS AN EPIDEMIC OF

04:20:47.832 --> 04:20:50.434
PROTESTS THIS OF POLIO.

04:20:50.501 --> 04:20:52.136
YOU HEARD FROM A LOT OF CHILDREN

04:20:52.203 --> 04:20:53.871
AND PARENTS TODAY THAT HAVE

04:20:53.938 --> 04:20:55.606
MEDICALLY FRAGILE CHILDREN THAT

04:20:55.673 --> 04:20:56.841
WOULD BE AT RISK.

04:20:56.907 --> 04:20:58.609
SO THERE ARE LOTS OF PLACES

04:20:58.676 --> 04:21:00.211
AROUND THE WORLD.

04:21:00.277 --> 04:21:02.413
THAT THEN IT IN ME IMMUNIZATIONS

04:21:02.480 --> 04:21:04.815
RATES COULD BE VERY VERY LOW AND

04:21:04.882 --> 04:21:06.484
SPEAKING OF SOMEONE GETTING --

04:21:06.550 --> 04:21:08.652
INFECTION BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT'S

04:21:08.719 --> 04:21:10.521
HAPPENING IN THE UNITED STATES.

04:21:10.588 --> 04:21:11.956
SO WE HAD IT IN HIS READING HIGH

04:21:12.023 --> 04:21:14.258
LEVEL ICE OF THE IMMUNIZATION

04:21:14.325 --> 04:21:16.527
AND BUT THAT'S THE WELL IT'S

04:21:16.594 --> 04:21:18.162
EVEN WITH HIGH LEVELS OF

04:21:18.229 --> 04:21:19.397
IMMUNIZATIONS.

04:21:19.463 --> 04:21:21.198
NONE OF THE INFECTIONS NOT OF

04:21:21.265 --> 04:21:22.366
THE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING

04:21:22.433 --> 04:21:26.037
RIGHT NOW ACTUALLY HAPPENING YOU

04:21:26.103 --> 04:21:27.338
KNOW.

04:21:27.405 --> 04:21:28.039
IN THE SCHOOLS IF YOU LOOK AT

04:21:28.105 --> 04:21:30.341
THE DISNEYLAND IT WAS ALL NOTS

04:21:30.408 --> 04:21:32.043
WITHIN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM.

04:21:32.109 --> 04:21:34.845
NOT A 85% OF THE MONTHS CASES

04:21:34.912 --> 04:21:36.814
THAT YOU HAVE SEEN IN THE UNITED

04:21:36.881 --> 04:21:38.449
STATES HAVE BEEN.

04:21:38.516 --> 04:21:39.884
RAINY NIGHT STE SO SO WHAT'S

04:21:39.950 --> 04:21:41.652
CLEAR IS THAT YOU'RE NOT JUST AT

04:21:41.719 --> 04:21:43.454
RISK IN A CLASSROOM YOU CAN BE

04:21:43.521 --> 04:21:45.189
AT RISK AT DISNEYLAND -- ON AN

04:21:45.256 --> 04:21:47.491
AIRPLANE OR ON A BUS IS THAT

04:21:47.558 --> 04:21:49.460
TRUE.

04:21:49.527 --> 04:21:51.362
LET ME LET ME DEFER TO THE OTHER

04:21:51.429 --> 04:21:52.496
DOCTOR BECAUSE I THINK YOU

04:21:52.563 --> 04:21:53.564
WANTED.

04:21:53.631 --> 04:21:55.366
TO OFFER A COMMENT YEAH I JUST

04:21:55.433 --> 04:21:57.068
WANT TO SAY THAT I I DON'T THINK

04:21:57.134 --> 04:21:58.736
WHAT'S ON THE TABLE TODAY IS

04:21:58.803 --> 04:22:00.704
WHETHER OR NOT VACCINES.

04:22:00.771 --> 04:22:02.440
ARE VALUABLE BECAUSE THEY VERY

04:22:02.506 --> 04:22:03.841
CLEARLY AREN'T BEING IMMUNIZED

04:22:03.908 --> 04:22:05.009
IS VALUABLE.

04:22:05.076 --> 04:22:08.379
BUT WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT IS --

04:22:08.446 --> 04:22:10.448
ATTEMPTING TO VACCINATE A VERY

04:22:10.514 --> 04:22:13.584
SMALL PERCENT OF THE POPULATION

04:22:13.651 --> 04:22:15.486
WHO ARE MEDICALLY FRAGILE AND

04:22:15.553 --> 04:22:18.489
WHO CAN HAVE SERIOUS REACTIONS

04:22:18.556 --> 04:22:19.290
RELATED TO THAT.

04:22:19.356 --> 04:22:21.358
AND SO THE AND IT ISN'T GOING TO

04:22:21.425 --> 04:22:24.095
CHANGE THE OVERALL HERD IMMUNITY

04:22:24.161 --> 04:22:25.362
IN OUR SCHOOLS AND IN OUR

04:22:25.429 --> 04:22:27.631
CLASSROOMS IT WON'T AFFECT THE

04:22:27.698 --> 04:22:28.866
RATE OF EPIDEMICS THAT WE'RE

04:22:28.933 --> 04:22:29.867
EXPERIENCING.

04:22:29.934 --> 04:22:31.669
IN MEASLES BECAUSE THAT'S NOT

04:22:31.735 --> 04:22:35.172
HAPPENING IN SCHOOL CLASSROOMS.

04:22:35.239 --> 04:22:36.440
RELATED WHEN WHEN YOU LOW HEARD

04:22:36.507 --> 04:22:38.042
OF MUNITY THANK YOU WHEN YOU

04:22:38.109 --> 04:22:41.512
HAVE A CLASSROOM THAT HAS 70%.

04:22:41.579 --> 04:22:43.347
OR LESS IMMUNIZATION DOES THAT

04:22:43.414 --> 04:22:44.982
POSE A RISK OF A CONSTITUENT

04:22:45.049 --> 04:22:46.417
ABSENT A CRIME SO RUDELY IT THEY

04:22:46.484 --> 04:22:48.819
HAVE AN IMMUNE COMPROMISED CHILD.

04:22:48.886 --> 04:22:50.054
THEY WOULD LIKE THEIR CHILD TO

04:22:50.121 --> 04:22:51.522
ATTEND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL THERE

04:22:51.589 --> 04:22:53.858
FEARFUL OF THAT CHILD

04:22:53.924 --> 04:22:58.095
CONTRACTING A POTENTIALLY FATAL.

04:22:58.162 --> 04:23:00.397
DISEASE BASED ON A LOW LEVEL OF

04:23:00.464 --> 04:23:01.932
IMMUNIZE STUDENTS IN THE

04:23:01.999 --> 04:23:04.068
CLASSROOM ABSOLUTELY I THINK

04:23:04.135 --> 04:23:06.337
THAT A CHILD WHO IS ON IMMUNIZED

04:23:06.403 --> 04:23:07.938
WILL BE PROTECTED BY HAVING A

04:23:08.005 --> 04:23:09.373
HIGHER IMMUNIZED.

04:23:09.440 --> 04:23:11.242
RATE IN THEIR CLASSROOM THANK

04:23:11.308 --> 04:23:12.710
YOU VERY MUCH.

04:23:12.776 --> 04:23:15.613
I'D LIKE TO ASK THE PROPONENT.

04:23:15.679 --> 04:23:16.580
YES I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO

04:23:16.647 --> 04:23:18.282
THAT -- AS A PUBLIC HEALTH

04:23:18.349 --> 04:23:20.017
OFFICIAL BOWS AND SEVEN CISCO

04:23:20.084 --> 04:23:21.318
COUNTY TALKING AND COLLEAGUES

04:23:21.385 --> 04:23:22.720
ACROSS THE STATE.

04:23:22.786 --> 04:23:25.789
I HAVE SEEN CLUSTERS OF UNPACKS

04:23:25.856 --> 04:23:27.258
OF HIGHER RATES A WHOOPING COUGH

04:23:27.324 --> 04:23:29.026
IN SCHOOLS WITH LOW VACCINATION

04:23:29.093 --> 04:23:29.493
RATES.

04:23:29.560 --> 04:23:31.195
AND I ALSO AM VERY CONFIDENT

04:23:31.262 --> 04:23:32.963
THAT THE UNDER VACCINATION

04:23:33.030 --> 04:23:34.665
CLUSTERS ARE WHAT'S DRIVING THE

04:23:34.732 --> 04:23:36.333
CURRENT OUTBREAK THE CURRENT

04:23:36.400 --> 04:23:38.569
INCREASING MEASLES IN THE

04:23:38.636 --> 04:23:39.503
COUNTRY AND IN THE STATE.

04:23:39.570 --> 04:23:41.138
AND THERE WAS SOME TESTIMONY

04:23:41.205 --> 04:23:45.509
EARLIER THAN -- WE DON'T HAVE.

04:23:45.576 --> 04:23:47.745
EVIDENCE OF FATALITIES FROM THE

04:23:47.811 --> 04:23:49.246
MEASLES WHAT ARE THE PUBLIC

04:23:49.313 --> 04:23:51.882
HEALTH RISKS OF MEASLES.

04:23:51.949 --> 04:23:53.884
BUT AGAIN I A WOOD RESTATED IN

04:23:53.951 --> 04:23:55.786
THOUGH ONE OF THE PUBLIC DISMAY

04:23:55.853 --> 04:23:57.221
WITH ONE IN A THOUSAND CANYON

04:23:57.288 --> 04:23:58.322
AND SOCIALITE AS WHICH IS A

04:23:58.389 --> 04:23:59.623
BRAIN INFECTION OR DEATH.

04:23:59.690 --> 04:24:00.691
THERE'S AN ISRAELI FLIGHT

04:24:00.758 --> 04:24:02.760
ATTENDANT RIGHT NOW IS IN A COMA

04:24:02.826 --> 04:24:04.461
FROM -- THERE'S A LARGE OUTBREAK

04:24:04.528 --> 04:24:05.663
IN ISRAEL RIGHT NOW WHICH IS

04:24:05.729 --> 04:24:07.097
ALSO DRIVING UNDER.

04:24:07.164 --> 04:24:08.599
VACCINATED POPULATIONS IN NEW

04:24:08.666 --> 04:24:10.868
YORK STATE -- AND AGAIN IT'S ONE

04:24:10.935 --> 04:24:11.869
OF THOSE AND I KNOW THAT IN NEW

04:24:11.936 --> 04:24:13.137
YORK CITY RIGHT NOW IT WAS

04:24:13.204 --> 04:24:14.538
ACTUALLY OVER A WEEK OR TWO AGO

04:24:14.605 --> 04:24:15.873
THEY SAID THERE ARE FIVE

04:24:15.940 --> 04:24:16.941
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT.

04:24:17.007 --> 04:24:18.375
MEASLES CASES SO THE VERY

04:24:18.442 --> 04:24:19.643
SERIOUS DISEASES AS A HIGH

04:24:19.710 --> 04:24:21.178
FIDELITY RATE FOR INFECTIONS IS

04:24:21.245 --> 04:24:22.580
PREVENTABLE.

04:24:22.646 --> 04:24:25.149
IN A CHILD WHO'S NOT.

04:24:25.216 --> 04:24:25.816
YET.

04:24:25.883 --> 04:24:27.618
THE APPROPRIATE AGE FOR MEASLES

04:24:27.685 --> 04:24:31.655
VACCINATION BE PUT AT RISK IF.

04:24:31.722 --> 04:24:33.757
YES BECAUSE TYPICALLY.

04:24:33.824 --> 04:24:35.125
INFANTS TO NOT GET VACCINATED

04:24:35.192 --> 04:24:36.527
UNTIL TWELVE TO FIFTEEN MONTHS

04:24:36.594 --> 04:24:38.529
OF AGE SO THOSE ARE THE ONES WHO

04:24:38.596 --> 04:24:39.163
ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE WHO ARE

04:24:39.230 --> 04:24:40.231
TRYING TO PROTECT.

04:24:40.297 --> 04:24:42.166
THANK YOU AND IF I COULD MISTER

04:24:42.233 --> 04:24:43.400
CHAIR.

04:24:43.467 --> 04:24:45.469
JUST TO COUPLE FINAL QUESTIONS

04:24:45.536 --> 04:24:46.470
FOR THE AUTHOR.

04:24:46.537 --> 04:24:49.506
I THINK THERE'S SOME CONFUSION

04:24:49.573 --> 04:24:51.008
AS TO WHAT YOUR BILL.

04:24:51.075 --> 04:24:53.077
DOES AND DOESN'T DO AND I'D LIKE

04:24:53.143 --> 04:24:55.846
TO JUST ASK HOW DOES A FAMILY

04:24:55.913 --> 04:24:56.814
WHO.

04:24:56.880 --> 04:25:00.417
HAS A HISTORY IN THEIR FAMILY --

04:25:00.484 --> 04:25:03.220
OF LET'S SAY -- A COMPROMISE

04:25:03.287 --> 04:25:05.356
CHILD AND THEN A SIBLING IS BORN

04:25:05.422 --> 04:25:07.391
THEY'RE WORRIED.

04:34:18.008 --> 04:34:19.743
A CHILD [inaudible]

PHYSICIAN'S RECOMMENDATION SO

04:34:22.412 --> 04:34:24.848
pPLEASE THANK YOU THANKS SO MUCH

04:34:24.915 --> 04:34:25.982
FOR THAT QUESTION SIR MITCHELL I

04:34:26.049 --> 04:34:26.917
WOULD POINT OUT THAT THE

04:34:26.983 --> 04:34:28.552
GRANTING OF A MEDICAL EXEMPTION

04:34:28.618 --> 04:34:30.086
IS ACTUALLY TRULY PUBLIC HEALTH

04:34:30.153 --> 04:34:31.054
FUNCTION.

04:34:31.121 --> 04:34:32.322
IT'S NOT THE DIAGNOSIS OR

04:34:32.389 --> 04:34:33.890
TREATMENT OF A PATIENT SO I

04:34:33.957 --> 04:34:36.026
WOULD POINT OUT IS THAT ALTHOUGH

04:34:36.092 --> 04:34:38.662
THIS IS OFTEN UP SICK KID -- BY

04:34:38.728 --> 04:34:41.198
THE OPPONENTS OF POST THIS BILL

04:34:41.264 --> 04:34:44.167
AND FOR USE IT.

04:34:44.234 --> 04:34:44.801
TO SEVEN SEVEN IS THAT NO CHILD

04:34:44.868 --> 04:34:45.735
WILL GIVE VACCINATED AGAINST

04:34:45.802 --> 04:34:48.171
THEIR PARENTS CONSENT.

04:34:48.238 --> 04:34:49.005
THAT NEVER HAPPENS.

04:34:49.072 --> 04:34:50.407
SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT THE

04:34:50.473 --> 04:34:52.776
CHILD THE FATE PARENT BRINGS A

04:34:52.843 --> 04:34:53.710
CHILD TO THE PHYSICIAN.

04:34:53.777 --> 04:34:55.745
THEY'LL HAVE A DISCUSSION -- THE

04:34:55.812 --> 04:34:57.480
POSITION AND THEIR TEAM WILL

04:34:57.547 --> 04:34:59.783
PRESENT THE INFORMATION OF THE

04:34:59.850 --> 04:35:00.951
VACCINE THE PARENT WILL DECIDE.

04:35:01.017 --> 04:35:02.185
WILL DECIDE WHERE TO GET CHILD

04:35:02.252 --> 04:35:04.754
VACCINATED OR NOT VACCINATED.

04:35:04.821 --> 04:35:06.690
THAT'S A DECISION THE PARENTS

04:35:06.756 --> 04:35:07.891
THAT'S A CURRENT LAW AS I TURNED

04:35:07.958 --> 04:35:10.193
WILL NOT CHANGE THAT WILL NOT

04:35:10.260 --> 04:35:11.194
CHANGE UNDER THIS BILL DO NOT

04:35:11.261 --> 04:35:12.262
CHANGE WITH TWO SEVEN SEVEN WILL

04:35:12.329 --> 04:35:12.863
NOT CHANGE WITH THIS BILL.

04:35:12.929 --> 04:35:14.564
RIGHT SO THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS

04:35:14.631 --> 04:35:16.333
THAT TO POSE A PARENT CHOOSES

04:35:16.399 --> 04:35:18.068
NOT TO VACCINATE THEIR CHILD.

04:35:18.134 --> 04:35:20.370
RIGHT THERE'S A CONSEQUENCES.

04:35:20.437 --> 04:35:21.905
AND THE CONSEQUENCES NOT BECAUSE

04:35:21.972 --> 04:35:23.707
STEP PARENT MADE THAT CHOICE THE

04:35:23.773 --> 04:35:24.774
CONSEQUENCES TO PROTECT THE

04:35:24.841 --> 04:35:25.842
OTHER CHILDREN.

04:35:25.909 --> 04:35:27.477
THAT'S WHY IN TWO SEVEN SEVEN AM

04:35:27.544 --> 04:35:29.212
I WANT TO READ LITIGATE TWO

04:35:29.279 --> 04:35:29.946
SEVEN SEVEN HERE BUT I JUST I

04:35:30.013 --> 04:35:32.082
POINT OUT WE GAVE PEOPLE OPTIONS

04:35:32.148 --> 04:35:32.816
THAT'S WHY THE EDUCATION

04:35:32.883 --> 04:35:34.017
COMMITTEE SAID THERE'S OPTIONS

04:35:34.084 --> 04:35:34.951
FOR WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DON'T

04:35:35.018 --> 04:35:36.152
CHOOSE NOT TO VACCINES YOU CAN

04:35:36.219 --> 04:35:37.087
STILL GET YOUR CHILD.

04:35:37.153 --> 04:35:38.788

SO FORTH BUT BUT WE HAVE TO

04:35:40.490 --> 04:35:42.259
PROTECT CHILDREN LIKE.

04:35:42.325 --> 04:35:43.393
MY WITNESSES HERE WHERE YOU AVE

04:35:43.460 --> 04:35:44.828
A CHILD WHO CANNOT TO BE

04:35:44.895 --> 04:35:46.796
VACCINATED SO THEN THE ISSUES

04:35:46.863 --> 04:35:47.497
THAT WE SAID OKAY FINE OF

04:35:47.564 --> 04:35:49.466
MEDICAL EXEMPTION YOU CAN GO TO

04:35:49.532 --> 04:35:50.000
SCHOOL.

04:35:50.066 --> 04:35:52.469
BUT THAT MEDICAL EXEMPTION -- IF

04:35:52.536 --> 04:35:53.937
IT'S NOT VALID WE END UP WITH

04:35:54.004 --> 04:35:55.305
SCHOOLS WITH MEDICAL ATTENTION

04:35:55.372 --> 04:35:57.641
RATES OF 30% 40% FIFTY FROM

04:35:57.707 --> 04:35:59.276
THAT'S NOT REALISTIC I THAT

04:35:59.342 --> 04:36:01.044
THAT'S THOSE ARE NOT REAL

04:36:01.111 --> 04:36:02.879
EXEMPTIONS UNLESS IT'S A SCHOOL

04:36:02.946 --> 04:36:04.347

04:36:04.414 --> 04:36:05.782
CANCER ARE HAVE TRANSPLANTS OR

04:36:05.849 --> 04:36:07.617
SOME OTHER PROBLEM AND THAT THEN

04:36:07.684 --> 04:36:09.019
PUTS THOSE CHILDREN AT RISK

04:36:09.085 --> 04:36:11.388
AGAIN AND THAT'S THE PUBLIC

04:36:11.454 --> 04:36:13.123
HEALTH IMPAIRED AND THAT IS WHY.

04:36:13.189 --> 04:36:14.457
BY THE WAY THE MEDICAL

04:36:14.524 --> 04:36:16.092
ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA

04:36:16.159 --> 04:36:17.694
MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AMERICAN

04:36:17.761 --> 04:36:19.095

04:36:19.162 --> 04:36:20.297
DISCOUNT COUNTY CHILDREN SPECIAL

04:36:20.363 --> 04:36:22.165
TEACHER COALITION THOSE ARE

04:36:22.232 --> 04:36:23.700
PEDIATRIC SUB SPECIALISTS WHO

ALL OF CCS KIDS.

04:36:28.672 --> 04:36:29.806
RIGHT THE KIDS WHO ARE THE MOST

04:36:29.873 --> 04:36:30.974
VULNERABLE AND THEY'RE STANDING

04:36:31.041 --> 04:36:32.409
IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL BECAUSE

04:36:32.475 --> 04:36:34.044
THEY KNOW IT'S THEIR PATIENTS

04:36:34.110 --> 04:36:36.413
ARE MOST AT RISK WHEN WE LET

04:36:36.479 --> 04:36:37.380
THESE FAKE MEDICAL EXCEPTIONS

04:36:37.447 --> 04:36:37.881
HAPPEN.

04:36:37.948 --> 04:36:38.648
AND SO THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE

04:36:38.715 --> 04:36:40.183
SAYING IS WE NEED PUBLIC HEALTH

04:36:40.250 --> 04:36:42.152
INTERVENE TO SAY THAT WHAT WE

EXEMPTIONS FROM THOSE WHO DONT

04:36:46.256 --> 04:36:52.896
BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE A

04:36:52.963 --> 04:36:53.964
HANDFUL OF PHYSICIANS.

04:36:54.030 --> 04:36:54.664

IN DANGER AND PARTICULARLY THOSE

04:37:00.270 --> 04:37:01.871
MEDICALLY FRAGILE PATIENTS AND

04:38:17.313 --> 04:38:17.814
NO LONGER INFECTIOUS TO THE

04:38:17.881 --> 04:38:18.615
PUBLIC.

04:38:18.681 --> 04:38:21.951
WE ALSO HAVE STORIES TO EXCLUDE

04:38:22.018 --> 04:38:23.253
ACTUALLY [inaudible]

04:38:23.319 --> 04:38:25.221
PEOPLE FROM.

04:38:25.288 --> 04:38:27.023
A CERTAIN SITUATIONS SO CHILD

04:38:27.090 --> 04:38:29.626
CARE'S AND WE HAVE HAD TO AGAIN

04:38:29.692 --> 04:38:31.127
IN THESE MEASLES OUTBREAKS THAT

04:38:31.194 --> 04:38:32.362
ARE ON GOING NOW.

04:38:32.429 --> 04:38:34.297
WE SOMETIMES HAVE EXPOSED

04:38:34.364 --> 04:38:36.566
INFANTS FROM AN AIRLINE FLIGHT

04:38:36.633 --> 04:38:38.735
OR FROM BEING IN A WAITING ROOM

04:38:38.802 --> 04:38:40.070
IN A CLINIC WHO'S BEEN EXPOSED

04:38:40.136 --> 04:38:41.271
TO MEASLES CASES THEY'RE TOO

04:38:41.337 --> 04:38:42.605
YOUNG TO BE VACCINATED.

04:38:42.672 --> 04:38:44.941
AND THEN THEY ACTUALLY WE TRY TO

04:38:45.008 --> 04:38:45.675
GET THEM POST EXPOSURE

04:38:45.742 --> 04:38:46.609
PREVENTION THAT'S PART OF A

04:38:46.676 --> 04:38:47.811
PUBLIC HEALTH ROLE SO WE GIVE

04:38:47.877 --> 04:38:49.546
THEM AN ANTIBODY TO HELP PREVENT

04:38:49.612 --> 04:38:50.046
THEM FROM.

04:38:50.113 --> 04:38:51.581
GETTING MEASLES BUT THEN THEY

04:38:51.648 --> 04:38:53.083
ALSO NEED TO BE KEPT AWAY

04:38:53.149 --> 04:38:54.751
BECAUSE THE INCUBATION PERIOD

04:38:54.818 --> 04:38:55.885
CAN BE A WEEK TO THREE WEEKS

04:38:55.952 --> 04:38:56.119
LATER.

04:38:56.186 --> 04:38:57.687
AND WE DON'T WANT -- PEOPLE WHO

04:38:57.754 --> 04:38:58.822
MIGHT BE INCUBATING MEASLES TO

04:38:58.888 --> 04:38:59.989
BE OUT THERE THAT'S WHAT WE DO

04:39:00.056 --> 04:39:02.225
INPUBLIC HEALTH TO TRY TO

04:39:02.292 --> 04:39:03.660
CONTAIN THE DISEASE.

04:39:03.726 --> 04:39:04.461
SO THOSE ARE SITUATIONS WHERE WE

04:39:04.527 --> 04:39:05.628
TRIED A WE EXCLUDE PEOPLE FROM

04:39:05.695 --> 04:39:07.330
WORK SOMETIMES WHEN YOU DO SO

04:39:07.397 --> 04:39:07.864
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE FOOD

04:39:07.931 --> 04:39:08.698
HANDLERS ARE IN YOU.

04:39:08.765 --> 04:39:09.866
THROUGH THAT COULD BE

04:39:09.933 --> 04:39:12.001
CONTAMINATED RIGHT OR THAT THEY

04:39:12.068 --> 04:39:13.703
HAVE TV OR WHATEVER -- GETTING

04:39:13.770 --> 04:39:15.505
BACK TO MY POINT SO SO THIS LIST

04:39:15.572 --> 04:39:18.141
THE TOP SAYS VACCINE REACTIONS

04:39:18.208 --> 04:39:20.009
SO THESE ARE REACTIONS PEOPLE

04:39:20.076 --> 04:39:23.379
MAY HAVE ONCE VACCINATED.

04:39:23.446 --> 04:39:25.548
AND SO THAT IS SEPARATE FROM A

04:39:25.615 --> 04:39:27.517
CHILD WHO MAY BE BORN MEDICALLY

04:39:27.584 --> 04:39:30.120
FRAGILE BORN WITH A COMPROMISED

04:39:30.186 --> 04:39:31.855
IMMUNE SYSTEM BORN WITH

04:39:31.921 --> 04:39:33.223
UNDERDEVELOPED LUNGS ECCENTRIC

04:39:33.289 --> 04:39:33.890
SETTER.

04:39:33.957 --> 04:39:37.393
SO DOCTOR PAN ON THIS LIST WELL

04:39:37.460 --> 04:39:39.863
THE PHILLIES ARE REACTIONS.

04:39:39.929 --> 04:39:42.599
THAT'S A DIFFERENT AND THE

04:39:42.665 --> 04:39:44.467
REASON I'M SAYING.

04:39:44.534 --> 04:39:45.735
AND WE'RE COMBINING.

04:39:45.802 --> 04:39:48.004
ALL OF THESE EXPERIENCES IN TWO

04:39:48.071 --> 04:39:49.405
ONE RATIONALE ABOUT OPPOSING THE

04:39:49.472 --> 04:39:51.741
BILL.

04:39:51.808 --> 04:39:52.208
IN A PROPERLY FROM MY

04:39:52.275 --> 04:39:54.744
PERSPECTIVE -- WE HEARD

04:39:54.811 --> 04:39:57.013
WITNESSES SAY -- THAT THEIR

04:39:57.080 --> 04:39:59.782
CURRENT MEDICAL EXEMPTION. FOR

04:39:59.849 --> 04:40:01.651
WHATEVER REASON WHETHER THE BABY

04:40:01.718 --> 04:40:03.887
WAS MEDICALLY FRAGILE -- HAS IS

04:40:03.953 --> 04:40:05.889
IMMUNE COMPROMISED HAS HAD A

04:40:05.955 --> 04:40:07.557
PATH REACTION HOWEVER THEY

04:40:07.624 --> 04:40:09.959
DEFINED IT WOULD NOT QUALIFY

04:40:10.026 --> 04:40:11.794
UNDER.

04:40:11.861 --> 04:40:13.429
TWO SEVEN SIX IS THAT --

04:40:13.496 --> 04:40:14.430
ACCURATE.

04:40:14.497 --> 04:40:16.866
THAT IS NOT ENTIRELY ACCURATE I

04:40:16.933 --> 04:40:18.735
THINK WHAT I WOULD SAY IS IS

04:40:18.801 --> 04:40:19.836
THAT.

04:40:19.903 --> 04:40:21.971
PLEASE PLEASE ACTIONS AT IN MY

04:40:22.038 --> 04:40:23.173
OPENING PRESENTATION.

04:40:23.239 --> 04:40:24.607
DISK LEADERS TO PHASES OF THE

04:40:24.674 --> 04:40:26.042
BILL FOR THE FIRST PHASES WE ARE

04:40:26.109 --> 04:40:27.944
ASKING THAT EVERY MEDICAL

04:40:28.011 --> 04:40:30.013
EXEMPTION THAT HAS BEEN GRANTED

04:40:30.079 --> 04:40:31.748
UP TO DATE AND MAYBE FOR THE

04:40:31.814 --> 04:40:33.383
NEXT COUPLE YEARS BECAUSE THERE

04:40:33.449 --> 04:40:34.317
SOMETIME FOR IMPLEMENTATION WILL

04:40:34.384 --> 04:40:36.819
BE AROUND THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE.

04:40:36.886 --> 04:40:37.987
FILED WITH THE PART OF PUBLIC

04:40:38.054 --> 04:40:40.790
HEALTH -- THE THE PUBLIC HEALTH

04:40:40.857 --> 04:40:42.225
DEPARTMENT NECESSARILY HALF WITH

04:40:42.292 --> 04:40:43.760
DAVID ON MAC WOULD BE ACTUALLY

04:40:43.826 --> 04:40:45.562
BE IN PLACE WE WOULD GIVE THE

04:40:45.628 --> 04:40:47.363
AUTHORITY FOR THE STATE PUBLIC

04:40:47.430 --> 04:40:48.765
HEALTH OFTEN COUNTY PUBLIC

04:40:48.831 --> 04:40:51.834
HEALTH OFFICER -- TO REVIEW TO

04:40:51.901 --> 04:40:54.070
POTENTIALLY INVALIDATE ONES THAT

04:40:54.137 --> 04:40:55.605
ARE INAPPROPRIATE THAT PUTS

04:40:55.672 --> 04:40:56.906
PUBLIC HEALTH A RISK BECAUSE

04:40:56.973 --> 04:40:58.441
AND FORTUNE WE KNOW THERE ARE

04:40:58.508 --> 04:41:00.276
MANY THAT FORTY MAY NOT

04:41:00.343 --> 04:41:02.245
NECESSARILY BE APPROPRIATE --

04:41:02.312 --> 04:41:03.213
BUT THERE'S NO ACTUAL

04:41:03.279 --> 04:41:04.847
REQUIREMENT THE PUBLIC HEALTH GO

04:41:04.914 --> 04:41:06.749
THROUGH ALL OF THE THAT BACKLOG

04:41:06.816 --> 04:41:08.151
BUT NOW REMOVING FORD IN A

04:41:08.218 --> 04:41:09.652
COUPLE YEARS WE WOULD HAVE A

04:41:09.719 --> 04:41:11.454
SYSTEM WHERE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

04:41:11.521 --> 04:41:14.123
IS A PHYSICIAN WOULD THAT APPLY.

04:41:14.190 --> 04:41:15.358
TO THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH

04:41:15.425 --> 04:41:18.361

MAINTAINING THE PATIENT PRIVACY

04:41:21.164 --> 04:41:23.866
LAWS AND THEN THE PUBLIC HEALTH

04:41:23.933 --> 04:41:25.201
OFFICER WOULD DECIDE WHETHER TO

04:41:25.268 --> 04:41:27.437
APPROVE OR DENY THAT'S WHAT

04:41:27.503 --> 04:41:28.471
HAPPENS WEST VIRGINIA AND

04:41:28.538 --> 04:41:30.173
THERE'S EVEN APPEAL PROCESS.

04:41:30.240 --> 04:41:30.907
IN CASE OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH

04:41:30.974 --> 04:41:31.841
OFFICER NIGHT TO PROVIDE MORE

04:41:31.908 --> 04:41:34.444
INFORMATION TO ENSURE THAT THERE

04:41:34.510 --> 04:41:36.312
THAT THIS DECISION IS MADE IN

04:41:36.379 --> 04:41:37.647
THE MOST.

04:41:37.714 --> 04:41:39.015
APPROPRIATE WAY AND ALSO YOU

04:41:39.082 --> 04:41:40.250
KNOW WE REALLY WANT TO GIVE --

04:41:40.316 --> 04:41:42.018
INVITE A LATITUDE AS POSSIBLE

04:41:42.085 --> 04:41:43.286
WE'RE WE'RE IT SEEMS LIKE

04:41:43.353 --> 04:41:45.521
THERE'S TRULY IS AN ISSUE RIGHT

04:41:45.588 --> 04:41:47.423
WITH -- THAT WITH -- WITH

04:41:47.490 --> 04:41:48.057
VACCINES IN THOSE THEY REALLY

04:41:48.124 --> 04:41:49.092
DESERVE MEDICAL EXEMPTION I

04:41:49.158 --> 04:41:50.293
THINK IN FACT IF YOU LOOK AT THE

04:41:50.360 --> 04:41:52.161
CDC GUIDELINES WHICH ARE BASED

04:41:52.228 --> 04:41:52.862
ON EVIDENCE.

04:41:52.929 --> 04:41:54.597
THEY ACTUALLY TEND TO LEAN

04:41:54.664 --> 04:41:56.199
TOWARD WELL IF IT'S POSSIBLY

04:41:56.266 --> 04:41:58.935
MIGHT EVEN WHATEVER THEN -- WILL

04:41:59.002 --> 04:42:00.236
PUT A PRECAUTION ON THEIR

04:42:00.303 --> 04:42:01.471
IMPACTS OF THIS A PRECAUTIONS IN

04:42:01.537 --> 04:42:02.939
CONTRADICTION SO WE ACTUALLY

04:42:03.006 --> 04:42:04.741
WANNA GIVE AS MUCH LATITUDE BUT

04:42:04.807 --> 04:42:06.075
ULTIMATELY WE ALSO RECOGNIZE WE

04:42:06.142 --> 04:42:07.710
NEED TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC AND

04:42:07.777 --> 04:42:15.351
WE DON'T WANT OUTBREAKS SO WHAT

04:42:15.418 --> 04:42:17.153
WE CAN'T HAVE IS -- I MEAN SOME

04:42:17.220 --> 04:42:18.121
OF THE THINGS ON YOUR HAIR LOSS.

04:42:18.187 --> 04:42:18.721
OKAY IS CURRENTLY ONE OF THE

04:42:18.788 --> 04:42:19.389
VACCINE REACTIONS LISTED ON YOUR

04:42:19.455 --> 04:42:20.023
CELLULITIS WHICH IS AN INFECTION

04:42:20.089 --> 04:42:21.357
OF THE SKIN.

04:42:21.424 --> 04:42:21.991
ARE YOU COULD GET SO LIES FROM

04:42:22.058 --> 04:42:22.759
INJECTION BUT IT'S PROBABLY NOT

04:42:22.825 --> 04:42:23.593
REALLY AND AND THERE'S NO.

04:42:23.660 --> 04:42:25.929
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE --

04:42:25.995 --> 04:42:26.863
AND THE RESEARCH HAS BEEN DONE I

04:42:26.929 --> 04:42:27.930
MEAN YOU'VE HEARD ACTUALLY SOME

04:42:27.997 --> 04:42:29.465
OF THE PEOPLE SAID MY CHILD HAS

04:42:29.532 --> 04:42:31.200
AUTISM AND THAT'S OUR VIçT

04:42:31.267 --> 04:42:32.535
EXENE REACTION THAT'S BEEN

04:42:32.602 --> 04:42:34.337
DEBUNKED THAT'S BEEN DISPROVEN

04:42:34.404 --> 04:42:35.905
AND THROUGH MULTIPLE STUDIES

04:42:35.972 --> 04:42:37.640
MOST RECENTLY IN A STUDY THOSE

04:42:37.707 --> 04:42:38.975
UNIDEN MARKET IS A GERMAN PLAYER

04:42:39.042 --> 04:42:39.475
TO ACTUALLY SHOW.

04:42:39.542 --> 04:42:40.410
THAT THE PEOPLE WHO WERE

04:42:40.476 --> 04:42:42.545
UNVACCINATED WERE MORE LIKELY TO

04:42:42.612 --> 04:42:43.813
HAVE BOXES AND THE PEOPLE WHO

04:42:43.880 --> 04:42:44.847
WERE VACCINATED I MEAN IT WASN'T

04:42:44.914 --> 04:42:46.516
SPECIFICALLY SIGNIFICANT BUT

04:42:46.582 --> 04:42:47.483
THAT'S WHAT THE RAW NUMBERS

04:42:47.550 --> 04:42:48.084
SHOWED.

04:42:48.151 --> 04:42:50.186
SO I THINK WE NEED TO BASE OUR

04:42:50.253 --> 04:42:51.587
EVIDENCE OUR OUR DECISIONS ON

04:42:51.654 --> 04:42:53.289
SCIENCE AND THE PURPOSE OF THIS

04:42:53.356 --> 04:42:54.657
IS NOT TO GET EVERYONE

04:42:54.724 --> 04:42:55.725
VACCINATED BUT TO BE SURE WE

04:42:55.792 --> 04:42:56.793
PROTECT THE PUBLIC TO PROTECT

04:42:56.859 --> 04:42:59.862
THE MOST VULNERABLE CHILDREN AND

04:42:59.929 --> 04:43:00.930
THAT'S WHAT THE PURPOSES BILLS.

04:43:00.997 --> 04:43:06.736
FOR SO SO HELP ME -- THE

04:43:06.803 --> 04:43:08.037
GRANDFATHERING IN IS THAT --

04:43:08.104 --> 04:43:09.072
SILENT IN THE BILL AND THEREFORE

04:43:09.138 --> 04:43:10.173
THAT'S WHAT WOULD HAPPEN OR IS

04:43:10.239 --> 04:43:11.341
THERE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT

04:43:11.407 --> 04:43:12.675
TALKS ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU

04:43:12.742 --> 04:43:14.444
WERE GRANDFATHERED IN SO WHAT

04:43:14.510 --> 04:43:15.745
THE BILL SAYS IS THAT IF YOU

04:43:15.812 --> 04:43:16.579
HAVE AN EXISTING MEDICAL

04:43:16.646 --> 04:43:17.480
EXEMPTION YOU FILE IT WITH

04:43:17.547 --> 04:43:18.715
APARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH ONE THE

04:43:18.781 --> 04:43:18.981
REASONS.

04:43:19.048 --> 04:43:21.818
WE ASK THAT IS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW

04:43:21.884 --> 04:43:22.919
THE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS.

04:43:22.985 --> 04:43:24.287
THEY GO TO THE SCHOOL AND

THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY AVAILABLE

TO THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT EXCEPT

04:43:26.989 --> 04:43:28.591
AS WITH THE NAMES REDACTED SO

04:43:28.658 --> 04:43:30.927
WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT -- IF

04:43:30.993 --> 04:43:32.161
THERE'S AN OUTBREAK WE ACTUALLY

04:43:32.228 --> 04:43:33.629
SAW THIS HAPPENED LAST YEAR IN

04:43:33.696 --> 04:43:34.731
THE BAY AREA.

04:43:34.797 --> 04:43:37.700
THERE'S AN OUTBREAK AND AND THE

04:43:37.767 --> 04:43:38.835
THE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS

04:43:38.901 --> 04:43:40.269
DON'T KNOW WHO HASN'T BEEN

04:43:40.336 --> 04:43:41.671
VACCINATED IN THE SCHOOL.

04:43:41.738 --> 04:43:43.406
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GET ACCESS TO

04:43:43.473 --> 04:43:44.807
WHO EXACTLY WHO HAS WHO'S BEEN

04:43:44.874 --> 04:43:46.509

INFORMATION FOR PUBLIC HEALTH

04:43:50.446 --> 04:43:52.815

04:45:02.251 --> 04:45:03.386
WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE WAIT FOR

04:45:03.453 --> 04:45:04.821

VACCINE WE WANT.

04:45:06.122 --> 04:45:07.190
TO PREVENT THE ACTOR SO WE WANT

04:45:07.256 --> 04:45:10.827
TO BE BEFORE AND THAT'S WHAT THE

04:45:10.893 --> 04:45:12.061
GUIDELINES -- ADDRESS.

04:45:12.128 --> 04:45:12.995
FINAL QUESTION THANK YOU FOR

YOUR DILIGENCE -- MISTER VICE

04:45:15.598 --> 04:45:17.366
CHAIRS SO.

04:45:17.433 --> 04:45:21.904
THE CONCERN ABOUT DOCTORS WHO

04:45:21.971 --> 04:45:23.539
ARE INAPPROPRIATELY BE THAT

04:45:23.606 --> 04:45:25.308
FAILING OR WHAT HAVE BEEN THE

04:45:25.374 --> 04:45:28.377
CASE MAY BE ISSUING EXEMPTIONS.

04:45:28.444 --> 04:45:29.879
IS THERE ANYTHING THE MEDICAL

04:45:29.946 --> 04:45:31.414
BOARD COULD CURRENTLY DO UNDER

04:45:31.481 --> 04:45:32.815
CURRENT LAW.

04:45:32.882 --> 04:45:34.450
COULD THE MEDICAL BOARD -- STEP

04:45:34.517 --> 04:45:39.055
IN AND INTERVENE -- OR OR OR OR

04:45:39.121 --> 04:45:43.192
OR IS SB TWO SEVEN SIX NECESSARY

04:45:43.259 --> 04:45:45.928
TO PREVENT THIS AND ABUSE AND A

04:45:45.995 --> 04:45:47.597
AN INAPPROPRIATE USE I WOULD

04:45:47.663 --> 04:45:49.432
MAKE NOTE THE REASON -- THAT TO

04:45:49.499 --> 04:45:51.868
THIS BILL IS SUBMITTED NOW AND

04:45:51.934 --> 04:45:53.302
NOT IN THE IT IS MERELY WHEN WE

04:45:53.369 --> 04:45:54.437
KNEW THE KNACK ASCENSION RATE

04:45:54.504 --> 04:45:55.438
WAS GOING UP BECAUSE I'VE BEEN

04:45:55.505 --> 04:45:56.405
IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

04:45:56.472 --> 04:45:58.274
MEDICAL PORTENT PARMA PUBLIC

04:45:58.341 --> 04:45:58.508
HEALTH.

04:45:58.574 --> 04:46:00.243
THE HOW TO ADDRESS THIS THE

04:46:00.309 --> 04:46:02.945
CHALLENGE FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD

04:46:03.012 --> 04:46:04.447
OF CALIFORNIA.

04:46:04.514 --> 04:46:05.081
THE CHARGE FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD

04:46:05.147 --> 04:46:05.982
CALIFORNIA'S THE NORMAL PROCESS

04:46:06.048 --> 04:46:06.849
IS THAT A PATIENT COMPLAINS

04:46:06.916 --> 04:46:09.418
ABOUT THIS BEHAVIOR BY PHYSICIAN.

04:46:09.485 --> 04:46:10.720
THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WHEN

04:46:10.786 --> 04:46:11.888
THE MEDICAL BOARD INVESTIGATES

04:46:11.954 --> 04:46:14.223
THAT PATIENT PROVIDES ACCESS TO

04:46:14.290 --> 04:46:16.092
THE MEDICAL RECORDS NECESSARY

04:46:16.158 --> 04:46:17.793
FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD TO DO THE

04:46:17.860 --> 04:46:19.295
INVESTIGATION OF THAT POSITION.

04:46:19.362 --> 04:46:21.731
IN THIS CASE THE FAMILY IS IN

04:46:21.797 --> 04:46:22.965
CAHOOTS WITH THE DOCTOR IS NOT

04:46:23.032 --> 04:46:24.467
BEHAVING PROFESSIONALLY AND

04:46:24.534 --> 04:46:25.668
THEREFORE ARE NOT PROVIDING THE

04:46:25.735 --> 04:46:26.903
MEDICAL RECORDS TO THE MEDICAL

04:46:26.969 --> 04:46:29.372
BOARD TO EXAMINE -- SO IT'S IT'S

04:46:29.438 --> 04:46:30.873
MAKES IT VERY CHALLENGING FOR

04:46:30.940 --> 04:46:31.507
THE MEDICAL BOARD TO DO

04:46:31.574 --> 04:46:32.642
INVESTIGATION THEY WOULD HAVE TO

04:46:32.708 --> 04:46:34.577
GO TO A JUDGE TRY TO SUBPOENA

04:46:34.644 --> 04:46:35.811
RECORDS THEY WOULD HAVE THE

04:46:35.878 --> 04:46:37.179
NAMES OF THE CHILDREN THAT THEY

04:46:37.246 --> 04:46:38.981
SHOULD BE LOOKING AT BECAUSE

04:46:39.048 --> 04:46:40.516
THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT.

04:46:40.583 --> 04:46:41.117
YOU'D HAVE TO GO AND SAY TELL

04:46:41.183 --> 04:46:42.518
THE JUDGE OH BY THE WAY I WANTED

04:46:42.585 --> 04:46:44.020
SUBPOENA THE ENTIRE MEDICAL

04:46:44.086 --> 04:46:45.788
RECORD FOR THIS DOCTOR IN GOING

04:46:45.855 --> 04:46:47.156
TO BUT SOMEONE PEOPLE MAY TERM A

04:46:47.223 --> 04:46:48.491
FISHING EXPEDITION TO LOOK.

04:46:48.558 --> 04:46:50.126
AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON EVEN

04:46:50.192 --> 04:46:51.060
THOUGH THEY KNOW THE STUFF

04:46:51.127 --> 04:46:52.261
THAT'S GOING ON NOW I WILL POINT

04:46:52.328 --> 04:46:53.896
OUT THE MEDICAL BOARD HAS ACTED

04:46:53.963 --> 04:46:55.364
ON ONE POSITION.

04:46:55.431 --> 04:46:56.632
THAT'S DOCTOR BOB SEARS WHERE

04:46:56.699 --> 04:46:58.034
PAY OR A FAMILY MEMBER DID

04:46:58.100 --> 04:47:00.503
COOPERATE AND IT TURNED OUT HE

04:47:00.570 --> 04:47:02.071
WAS ACTING NEGLIGENTLY AND TO

04:47:02.138 --> 04:47:04.340
HIS LICENSES ON PROBATION -- AT

04:47:04.407 --> 04:47:05.308
FOUR FOR DOING THIS BUT IT'S

04:47:05.374 --> 04:47:06.709
VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE MEDICAL

04:47:06.776 --> 04:47:08.144
BOARD TO ACT THAT WHILE ONLY

04:47:08.210 --> 04:47:10.046
HAPPEN BECAUSE A FAMILY MEMBER

04:47:10.112 --> 04:47:11.347
ACTUALLY CHARLES TO HAVE THEIR

04:47:11.414 --> 04:47:13.416
RECORDS MADE PUBLIC AND AND AND

04:47:13.482 --> 04:47:14.517
NAMES MADE PUBLIC.

04:47:14.584 --> 04:47:16.986
YEAH CAM FORWARD EXACTLY SO THAT

04:47:17.053 --> 04:47:18.454
WHILE A CLAIM ABOUT NEGLIGENCE.

04:47:18.521 --> 04:47:20.356
YES THAT'S THE PROBLEM RIGHT SO

04:47:20.423 --> 04:47:21.924
YOU HAVE TO PERSUADE SOMEONE WHO

04:47:21.991 --> 04:47:23.859
WHO BOUGHT MEDICAL EXEMPTION TO

04:47:23.926 --> 04:47:24.760
WHY THE BACK OF THE ENGINE SAY --

04:47:24.827 --> 04:47:30.166
NOW I FILE A COMPLAINT AND

04:47:30.232 --> 04:47:31.033
REVEAL THE RECORDS.

04:47:31.100 --> 04:47:32.068
AND SO THAT'S BEEN THE CHALLENGE

04:47:32.134 --> 04:47:32.568
FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD.

04:47:32.635 --> 04:47:33.402
NOW ACTUALLY WITH THIS BILL WITH

04:47:33.469 --> 04:47:34.003
AND PUBLIC HEALTH HAVING THE

04:47:34.070 --> 04:47:35.538
LISTS OF CHILDREN WHO GET

04:47:35.605 --> 04:47:36.906
MEDICAL CENTERS A. C. PATTERN.

04:47:36.973 --> 04:47:37.807
THEY ACTUALLY THEN CAN BE A DO

04:47:37.873 --> 04:47:39.375
MORE TARGET INVESTIGATIONS TRY

04:47:39.442 --> 04:47:40.843
SUBPOENA EVERY RECORD THEY COULD

04:47:40.910 --> 04:47:41.811
GO SUBPOENA THOSE PARTICULAR

04:47:41.877 --> 04:47:43.813
RECORDS AND GO AFTER PHYSICIAN

04:47:43.879 --> 04:47:45.514
WHO'S BEING PARTICULARLY BEING

04:47:45.581 --> 04:47:47.383
UNPROFESSIONAL AND AND AND AND

04:47:47.450 --> 04:47:48.284
AND FOCUS ON THAT BECAUSE THEY

04:47:48.351 --> 04:47:50.486
CAN GET THAT INFORMATION FROM

04:47:50.553 --> 04:47:51.420
THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT.

04:47:51.487 --> 04:47:56.292
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

04:47:56.359 --> 04:47:57.360
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I TOO

04:47:57.426 --> 04:47:58.694
WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR

04:47:58.761 --> 04:48:00.296
PATIENCE AND I WANT THINK

04:48:00.363 --> 04:48:01.764
EVERYONE WHO'S BEEN HERE TODAY --

04:48:01.831 --> 04:48:03.899
IN OPPOSITION AND IN SUPPORT

04:48:03.966 --> 04:48:04.934
THIS IS WHAT DEMOCRACY LOOKS

04:48:05.001 --> 04:48:06.469
LIKE.

04:48:06.535 --> 04:48:08.571
DOCTOR PM LAST TIME AROUND I DID

04:48:08.638 --> 04:48:09.639
NOT SUPPORT THE BILL.

04:48:09.705 --> 04:48:11.107
I DO NOT SUPPORT FOR THE REASONS

04:48:11.173 --> 04:48:12.808
MOST PEOPLE THINK I'M FULLY

04:48:12.875 --> 04:48:13.876
VACCINATED MY HUSBAND'S

04:48:13.943 --> 04:48:15.111
VACCINATE OUR CHILDREN OR FULLY

04:48:15.177 --> 04:48:17.713
VACCINATED I HAD A CONCERN.

04:48:17.780 --> 04:48:20.616
OVER WORKING FAMILIES WHO DID

04:48:20.683 --> 04:48:21.550
NOT VACCINATE THEIR CHILDREN BUT

04:48:21.617 --> 04:48:22.752
NOT BILLS THAT THEY WOULD HAVE

04:48:22.818 --> 04:48:23.986
TO HOME SCHOOL THEIR CHILD.

04:48:24.053 --> 04:48:25.721
YOUR NEW BILL DOES NOT CHANGE

04:48:25.788 --> 04:48:27.523
THAT -- SAYS STILL CONCERN FOR

04:48:27.590 --> 04:48:30.159
ME BUT I THINK MY BIGGER CONCERN

04:48:30.226 --> 04:48:31.861
GOES ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT --

04:48:31.927 --> 04:48:33.829
CENTER MITCHELL WAS ASKING ARE

04:48:33.896 --> 04:48:36.799
THESE DOCTORS WHO ARE.

04:48:36.866 --> 04:48:39.969
WHO ARE A RONI IS FULLY --

04:48:40.036 --> 04:48:42.004
REALLY CIRCUMVENTING THE SYSTEM

04:48:42.071 --> 04:48:43.839
OR THEY FOUND A LOOPHOLE IN THE

04:48:43.906 --> 04:48:44.640
SYSTEM.

04:48:44.707 --> 04:48:46.976
AND UNFORTUNATELY FOR ALL OF US

04:48:47.043 --> 04:48:49.412
AND FOR EVERYONE WE LEGISLATE TO

04:48:49.478 --> 04:48:50.579
THE BAD ACTORS.

04:48:50.646 --> 04:48:52.548
AND WE PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE HERE

04:48:52.615 --> 04:48:55.251
WITH THIS BILL I'M GUESSING.

04:48:55.317 --> 04:48:57.153
IF WE DIDN'T HAVE DOCTORS WHO

04:48:57.219 --> 04:48:59.288
WERE DOING WHAT THEY'RE DOING --

04:48:59.355 --> 04:49:00.656
I JUST WANT TO FOLLOW UP A

04:49:00.723 --> 04:49:02.358
LITTLE BIT ON WHAT SENATOR

04:49:02.425 --> 04:49:03.559
MITCHELL ASKED.

04:49:03.626 --> 04:49:05.094
AND MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND IT IS

04:49:05.161 --> 04:49:06.529
WELL BECAUSE I DID HAVE A

04:49:06.595 --> 04:49:09.298
QUESTION TWO ABOUT THE DOCTOR'S

04:49:09.365 --> 04:49:10.933
GOING TO THE MEDICAL BOARD AND

04:49:11.000 --> 04:49:11.500
JUST GETTING RID OF THE BAD

04:49:11.567 --> 04:49:12.401
ACTORS.

04:49:12.468 --> 04:49:13.836
SO YOU HAVE EXPLAINED THAT THE

04:49:13.903 --> 04:49:16.038
REASON THAT'S A PROBLEM IS IF I

04:49:16.105 --> 04:49:17.606
SAY SURE YOU CAN LOOK AT MY

04:49:17.673 --> 04:49:19.842
RECORDS BUT THEN EVERYONE ELSE

04:49:19.909 --> 04:49:21.210
THE EVERITT APPEARANCES NO YOU

04:49:21.277 --> 04:49:23.612
CAN'T YOU HAVE TO SUBPOENA THEM

04:49:23.679 --> 04:49:26.048
THEY TAKE TOO LONG CORRECT.

04:49:26.115 --> 04:49:27.349
IT'S A IT'S A I'M NOT THE

04:49:27.416 --> 04:49:28.951
ATTORNEY -- BUT IMAGINE GOING TO

04:49:29.018 --> 04:49:30.086
THE JUDGE AND SAYING I WANT TO

04:49:30.152 --> 04:49:31.721
SUBPOENA EVERY MEDICAL RECORD OF

04:49:31.787 --> 04:49:33.255
THIS PARTICULAR POSITION GOOD

04:49:33.322 --> 04:49:34.690
I'M TRYING TO FIND THESE THINGS.

04:49:34.757 --> 04:49:36.158
YEAH WE WE DO WANT TO PROTECT

04:49:36.225 --> 04:49:37.526
PATIENT PRIVACY WE DON'T WANT

04:49:37.593 --> 04:49:38.394
THE MEDICAL BOARD GOING

04:49:38.461 --> 04:49:39.462
OFFICIALLY EXPEDITIONS AND I

04:49:39.528 --> 04:49:40.930
THINK THAT THAT WOULD RAISE

04:49:40.996 --> 04:49:42.231
CONCERNS IN THE JUDGE'S MIND

04:49:42.298 --> 04:49:43.999
ABOUT WHAT IT'S GOING HERE DAVID

04:49:44.066 --> 04:49:45.000
WHAT WHICH PATIENTS ARE YOU

04:49:45.067 --> 04:49:46.035
LOOKING AT WHICH ONES.

04:49:46.102 --> 04:49:47.369
INSTEAD OF TRYING TO DO A BROAD

04:49:47.436 --> 04:49:49.105
SWEEP THROUGH THE ENTIRE MEDICAL

04:49:49.171 --> 04:49:50.172
RECORD OF A PARTICULAR POSITION

04:49:50.239 --> 04:49:52.441
GOT IT SO IF YOU COULD JUST

04:49:52.508 --> 04:49:55.111
EXPLAIN TO US HOW YOU THINK THAT

04:49:55.177 --> 04:49:56.145
THE THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC

04:49:56.212 --> 04:49:56.812
HEALTH.

04:49:56.879 --> 04:49:59.081
HOW THIS NEW SYSTEM UNDER YOUR

04:49:59.148 --> 04:50:00.616
BILL WOULD WORK AND I IT WOULD

04:50:00.683 --> 04:50:01.717
BE HELPFUL TO ME?

04:50:01.784 --> 04:50:02.852
YES AND AGAIN I WOULD POINT OUT

04:50:02.918 --> 04:50:04.286
THAT WE WOULD NOT BE THE FIRST

04:50:04.353 --> 04:50:09.592
STATE TO DO THIS SO WE THERE IS

04:50:09.658 --> 04:50:11.060
EXT.

04:50:11.127 --> 04:50:11.660
OUT THERE IN ANOTHER STATE AND

04:50:11.727 --> 04:50:13.162
IT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS IS THAT --

04:50:13.229 --> 04:50:13.963
IS IT IS JUST TO PHASES AS I

04:50:14.029 --> 04:50:15.131
EXPLAIN SO IN THE FIRST PHASE

04:50:15.197 --> 04:50:16.031
BASICALLY PEOPLE JUST FILE

04:50:16.098 --> 04:50:16.766
DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH IT

04:50:16.832 --> 04:50:17.967
WOULD HAVE INFORMATION IN CASE

04:50:18.033 --> 04:50:18.634
THERE'S AN OUTBREAK SO THEY CAN

04:50:18.701 --> 04:50:19.468
ACT ON IT.

04:50:19.535 --> 04:50:21.203
THERE WOULD BE THE ABILITY OF

THEY'RE CHOOSING NOT TO

05:01:19.361 --> 05:01:20.796
VACCINATE HIM IS THAT WHAT

05:01:20.862 --> 05:01:21.830

GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE -- THAT TO

05:01:26.435 --> 05:01:29.771
CAME UP -- SO THERE I WHEN WE

05:01:36.611 --> 05:01:37.312
DISEASE.

05:01:37.379 --> 05:01:38.146
AND THE REASON SHE WAS

05:01:38.213 --> 05:01:39.881
COMMUNICATING SHE SAID MY CHILD

05:01:39.948 --> 05:01:41.917

SAFETY THEN SENT HER HOME --

05:02:07.242 --> 05:02:09.377

05:02:16.618 --> 05:02:17.819
VACCINATE.

05:02:17.886 --> 05:02:18.854
DESPITE FACTORS NO REASON THEY

05:02:18.920 --> 05:02:20.589
COULD BE ACCINATED THEIR CHILD

05:02:20.655 --> 05:02:22.891
STILL GUY GOT TO ATTEND SCHOOL

05:02:22.958 --> 05:02:24.326
HE SAID WHAT'S THE JUSTICE

05:02:24.392 --> 05:02:25.760
WHAT'S THE RIGHT THERE DAY MADE

05:02:25.827 --> 05:02:27.996
A CHOICE BUT I DIDN'T I DIDN'T

05:02:28.063 --> 05:02:29.164
HAVE A CHOICE I DON'T HAVE A

05:02:29.231 --> 05:02:30.165
CHOICE.

05:02:30.232 --> 05:02:30.866
SO IF THERE'S A CHILD WHO

05:02:30.932 --> 05:02:32.300
GENERALLY HAS A MEDICAL

05:02:32.367 --> 05:02:33.568
EXEMPTION THEN THEY WOULD BE

05:02:33.635 --> 05:02:35.136
ALLOWED TO ATTEND SCHOOL THAT'S

05:02:35.203 --> 05:02:37.539
THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL

05:02:37.606 --> 05:02:38.740
AND THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF TWO

05:02:38.807 --> 05:02:39.741
SEVEN SEVEN THEY GENERALLY HAVE.

05:02:39.808 --> 05:02:42.644
A MEDICAL CONTRA EDUCATION A

05:02:42.711 --> 05:02:44.346
PRECAUTION TO VACCINATION -- SO

05:02:44.412 --> 05:02:45.647
I DON'T HAS ONE THEN HE WOULD

05:02:45.714 --> 05:02:48.216
GET A MEDICAL EXEMPTION YOU CAN

05:02:48.283 --> 05:02:50.585
GO TO SCHOOL.

05:02:50.652 --> 05:02:51.553
OKAY.

05:02:51.620 --> 05:02:52.921
EVAN I AM OF MOVE ON TO ANOTHER

05:02:52.988 --> 05:02:53.522
QUESTION CAN YOU GIVE ME AND

05:02:53.588 --> 05:02:54.923
CALIFORNIA EXAMPLE OF THE

05:02:54.990 --> 05:02:56.024
VACCINE PREVENTABLE DISEASE

05:02:56.091 --> 05:02:57.225
OUTBREAK THAT OCCURRED IN ONE OF

05:02:57.292 --> 05:02:58.326
THE POCKETS.

05:02:58.393 --> 05:02:59.728
OF UNVACCINATED CHILDREN ARE THE

05:02:59.794 --> 05:03:01.730
AREAS WHERE THERE'S A HIGHER

05:03:01.796 --> 05:03:02.631
PERCENTAGE I THINK SENATOR

05:03:02.697 --> 05:03:05.467
BUNNING SAID 270% OF US SOME OF

05:03:05.534 --> 05:03:06.501
THE SCHOOLS IN THIS DISTRICT

05:03:06.568 --> 05:03:07.002
WERE.

05:03:07.068 --> 05:03:08.637
ARE NOT VACCINATED OR ARE

05:03:08.703 --> 05:03:10.539
VACCINATED BUT IT'S AT A 70%

05:03:10.605 --> 05:03:12.841
THRESHOLD AND 796%.

05:03:12.908 --> 05:03:14.876
SO IS THERE A IS THERE A

05:03:14.943 --> 05:03:16.745
CALIFORNIA EXAMPLE DIRECTOR

05:03:16.811 --> 05:03:18.280
SEVERAL CALIFORNIA'S SAMPLE SO

05:03:18.346 --> 05:03:19.648
FOR EXAMPLE WELL FIRST OF ALL AN

05:03:19.714 --> 05:03:22.083
EXAMINATION OF THE OUTBREAK THAT

05:03:22.150 --> 05:03:23.218
START IN DISNEYLAND.

05:03:23.285 --> 05:03:24.586
THAT -- BASICALLY MAINLY SPREAD

05:03:24.653 --> 05:03:25.754
AND AMONG UNVACCINATED

05:03:25.820 --> 05:03:27.689
POPULATIONS SO WHILE THERE IS A

05:03:27.756 --> 05:03:28.690
SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE GOT

05:03:28.757 --> 05:03:30.325
VACCINATED TO DID GET THE

05:03:30.392 --> 05:03:32.294
DISEASE IT'S A BIT PRIMARILY

05:03:32.360 --> 05:03:33.361
AMONG THEM VACCINATED.

05:03:33.428 --> 05:03:34.696
WHAT WE HAVE FOR TESTIS OUTBREAK

05:03:34.763 --> 05:03:36.164
IN TWENTY TEN HERE IN THE STATE

05:03:36.231 --> 05:03:37.432
OF CALIFORNIA BUT I'D LIKE TO

05:03:37.499 --> 05:03:40.201
MENTION THAT -- INK -- NINE

05:03:40.268 --> 05:03:46.708
INFANTS DIED SEVERAL HUNDRED

05:03:46.775 --> 05:03:48.610
WERE OVER HOSPITALIZED -- DAY

05:03:48.677 --> 05:03:50.645
AGAIN EXAMINED WHERE DID THE

05:03:50.712 --> 05:03:51.846
WORD THAT PROCESSES OUTBREAK

05:03:51.913 --> 05:03:53.515
SPREAD AND IT MAINLY SPREAD IN

05:03:53.582 --> 05:03:55.183
AREAS WITH LOW VACCINATION RATES

05:03:55.250 --> 05:03:56.451
IS BASICALLY IS DEFINED BY.

05:03:56.518 --> 05:03:57.485
HI PERSONAL BET BELIEVE

05:03:57.552 --> 05:03:58.653
EXEMPTION OUR LOW VACCINATION

05:03:58.720 --> 05:03:59.888
RATES OF KIDS OF THE SCOPE OF

05:03:59.955 --> 05:04:01.890
PEOPLE ATTACK OF SCHOOLS IN

05:04:01.957 --> 05:04:03.825
THOSE COMMUNITIES AND SO THE

05:04:03.892 --> 05:04:05.427
RESEARCH AFTER THE MAGIC

05:04:05.493 --> 05:04:06.528
RESEARCH IS DEFINITELY IDENTIFY

05:04:06.595 --> 05:04:07.429
TENS TRACE.

05:04:07.495 --> 05:04:09.998
THAT THESE OUTBREAKS ARE RELATED

05:04:10.065 --> 05:04:10.999
TO COMMUNITIES WITH LOW

05:04:11.066 --> 05:04:12.267
VACCINATION RATES AND IS WERE

05:04:12.334 --> 05:04:13.635
LOOKING AT OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE

05:04:13.702 --> 05:04:14.603
STILL ON GOING SOME OF THESE

05:04:14.669 --> 05:04:16.338
OUTBREAKS GOING ON RIGHT NOW

05:04:16.404 --> 05:04:18.673
TODAY AND AS MEASLES ACROSS THE

05:04:18.740 --> 05:04:21.910
COUNTRY -- BUT SO PEOPLE NEED TO

05:04:21.977 --> 05:04:23.278
GATHER BUT THE CURRENT DATA

05:04:23.345 --> 05:04:25.513
SHOWS THAT IT'S MAINLYSPREADING

05:04:25.580 --> 05:04:27.983
AND COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN-TARGETED -- WITH LOW VACCINATION

05:04:28.049 --> 05:04:29.384
RATES OF THE OUTBREAK GOING ON

05:04:29.451 --> 05:04:30.819
IN NEW YORK AGAIN LOW

05:04:30.885 --> 05:04:32.854
VACCINATION RATE COMMUNITY --

05:04:32.921 --> 05:04:34.356
THE ONE TO HAPPEN MINNESOTA BUT

05:04:34.422 --> 05:04:35.624
THE IN THE SMALL THE COMMUNITY

05:04:35.690 --> 05:04:36.825
FOR THE VACCINATION RATE WENT

05:04:36.891 --> 05:04:38.159
FROM THE 90% SOUNDS I THINK

05:04:38.226 --> 05:04:39.628
AROUND 40% THAT THEY HAD A

05:04:39.694 --> 05:04:41.196
MEASLES OUTBREAK -- THE IN

05:04:41.262 --> 05:04:42.831
WASHINGTON CITY WASHINGTON

05:04:42.897 --> 05:04:44.566
ACTUALLY THE OUTBREAK AGAIN AND

05:04:44.633 --> 05:04:47.202
COMMUNITIES OF LOW VACCINATION

05:04:47.268 --> 05:04:57.245
RATES I WOULD POINT OUT THAT

05:04:57.312 --> 05:04:57.779
THOSE ATTORNEYS VERTICALLY

05:04:57.846 --> 05:04:59.314
TARGETED WITH ANTI VACCINE THIS

05:04:59.381 --> 05:05:00.415
INFORMATION -- SO THEIR ANTI

05:05:00.482 --> 05:05:02.117
VACCINE GROUPS -- THAT WENT OUT

05:05:02.183 --> 05:05:02.751
TO THIS COMMITTEES PRIOR TO THIS

05:05:02.817 --> 05:05:03.351
OUTBREAKS AND DROVE DOWN THE

05:05:03.418 --> 05:05:03.885
VACCINATION RATES AND NOT

05:05:03.952 --> 05:05:04.853
SURPRISINGLY THEY NOW HAVE

05:05:04.919 --> 05:05:06.321
MEASLES OUTBREAKS GOING ON SO IN

05:05:06.388 --> 05:05:07.322
FACT THE TAUGHT TARGET THE

05:05:07.389 --> 05:05:08.890
SLAVIC COMMUNITY AND AS A LOT OF

05:05:08.957 --> 05:05:09.758
PEOPLE AND STOP THE COMMUNITY

05:05:09.824 --> 05:05:10.291
HERE.

05:05:10.358 --> 05:05:11.059
THE TARGET THE SLAVIC COMMUNITY

05:05:11.126 --> 05:05:13.128
IN STATE OF WASHINGTON -- IS --

05:05:13.194 --> 05:05:14.429
AND THAT'S WHERE THE OUTBREAK A

05:05:14.496 --> 05:05:15.263
LOT THE OUTBREAK HAPPENED AND SO

05:05:15.330 --> 05:05:16.064
THAT'S THAT'S THE DANGER THAT WE

05:05:16.131 --> 05:05:16.998
HAVE WE HAVE AREAS WITH LOW

05:05:17.065 --> 05:05:17.799
VACCINATION RATES.

05:05:17.866 --> 05:05:18.466
THAT'S WHAT THE OUTBREAKS HAPPEN

05:05:18.533 --> 05:05:20.068
IN TWENTY TEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA

05:05:20.135 --> 05:05:21.736
WE HAD INFANTS DIE OF THE

05:05:21.803 --> 05:05:23.705
VACCINE PREVENTABLE DISEASE

05:05:23.772 --> 05:05:24.906
BECAUSE OF THAT.

05:05:24.973 --> 05:05:25.774
SAYS A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL AND

05:05:25.840 --> 05:05:27.709
I I RESPECT YOUR OPINION --

05:05:27.776 --> 05:05:29.144
THERE WAS A TWO THOUSAND

05:05:29.210 --> 05:05:29.911
EIGHTEEN WHOOPING COUGH OUTBREAK

05:05:29.978 --> 05:05:31.913
IN HARVARD WESTLAKE SCHOOLS IN

05:05:31.980 --> 05:05:35.450
THE CASES -- WERE ALL VACCINATED

05:05:35.517 --> 05:05:36.951
KIDS LIKE DATA ALL RECEIVED

05:05:37.018 --> 05:05:39.154
VACCINATIONS -- THERE WERE

05:05:39.220 --> 05:05:40.121
EIGHTEEN KIDS THAT WENT TO THAT

05:05:40.188 --> 05:05:42.590
SCHOOL THAT WERE NOT VACCINATED

05:05:42.657 --> 05:05:44.159
FOR WHATEVER REASON THE PARENTS

05:05:44.225 --> 05:05:45.460
CHOICE THE MEDICAL EXEMPTION I'M

05:05:45.527 --> 05:05:47.495
NOT SURE WHY BUT THEY WEREN'T

05:05:47.562 --> 05:05:47.996
VACCINATED.

05:05:48.063 --> 05:05:49.364
NONE OF THOSE KIDS WERE AFFECTED

05:05:49.431 --> 05:05:50.999
BUT THE ONES THAT WERE AFFECTED

05:05:51.066 --> 05:05:53.168
WERE VACCINATED KIDS.

05:05:53.234 --> 05:05:54.002
HOW IS THAT HALF OF FIRST OF ALL

05:05:54.069 --> 05:05:55.403
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND EACH

05:05:55.470 --> 05:05:58.206
VACCINE HAS ITS OWN PROFILE SO

05:05:58.273 --> 05:05:59.607
FOR EXAMPLE WHEN THE CHALLENGES

05:05:59.674 --> 05:06:00.809
WERE HAVING WITH THE PROTESTS AS

05:06:00.875 --> 05:06:02.777
VACCINE IN FACT THIS IS ONE OF

05:06:02.844 --> 05:06:05.346
OUR RESPONSES HERE IN CALIFORNIA

05:06:05.413 --> 05:06:07.015
TO THE PROTEST THIS OUTBREAK IN?

05:06:07.082 --> 05:06:07.716
TWENTY TEN WAS ACTUALLY DO

05:06:07.782 --> 05:06:10.151
REQUIRE FOR TOSSES VACCINATION

05:06:10.218 --> 05:06:12.020
AT TWELVE YEARS OLDER ENTRIES

05:06:12.087 --> 05:06:13.788
SEVENTH GRADE THAT'S WHEN THIS

05:06:13.855 --> 05:06:16.157
LEGISLATURE PASSED ACTED ON THAT.

05:06:16.224 --> 05:06:17.859
BECAUSE THE THE PROTECTIVE

05:06:17.926 --> 05:06:20.128
VACCINE THAT'S CURRENTLY USE THE

05:06:20.195 --> 05:06:21.296
A CELL IN A PROTEST AS VACCINE.

05:06:21.362 --> 05:06:23.064
UNFORTUNATE DOES NOT LAST AS

05:06:23.131 --> 05:06:25.867
LONG -- AND IT IN FACT ACTUALLY

05:06:25.934 --> 05:06:26.835
PROTECT THIS WAS A YOU CATCH FOR

05:06:26.901 --> 05:06:28.136
TOSSES THAT THE ACTUAL DISEASE

05:06:28.203 --> 05:06:30.405
YOU ONLY DEVELOP A LIMITED TIME

05:06:30.472 --> 05:06:32.140
YOU IMMUNITY DEBT WAYNE'S.

05:06:32.207 --> 05:06:33.775
SO -- THAT'S BEEN SO SAME WITH

05:06:33.842 --> 05:06:35.844
THE VACCINATION AS WELL AND SO

05:06:35.910 --> 05:06:36.878
WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WHAT YOU

05:06:36.945 --> 05:06:39.047
YOU DO SUPER TOSSES OUT BREAKS

05:06:39.114 --> 05:06:40.381
AND SOMEONE WILL BRING UP MONTHS

05:06:40.448 --> 05:06:41.616
IN RIGHT AND WE SEE THESE MOMS

05:06:41.683 --> 05:06:42.250
OUTBREAKS.

05:06:42.317 --> 05:06:43.318
THE GENERALLY AND FOR AND

05:06:43.384 --> 05:06:44.686
POPULATIONS WHERE THE

05:06:44.753 --> 05:06:46.187
VACCINATION ITSELF MIGHT HAVE

05:06:46.254 --> 05:06:55.263
WORN OFF A BIT AND SO THAT'S

05:06:55.330 --> 05:06:56.231
SOMETHING PEOPLE LOOK AT THAT

05:06:56.297 --> 05:06:56.865
ENTRY NEW RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT

05:06:56.931 --> 05:06:58.299
VACCINATION SO BEFORE LOOKING AT

05:06:58.366 --> 05:06:58.967
THE PROTEST AS VACCINATION RIGHT

05:06:59.033 --> 05:06:59.601
NOW WE RECOMMEND EVERYONE YOU

05:06:59.667 --> 05:07:00.702
GET ONE VERY TEN YEARS AFTER

05:07:00.769 --> 05:07:01.035
YOUR INITIAL.

05:07:01.102 --> 05:07:02.337
SERIES BEFORE LOOK AT DO WE NEED

05:07:02.403 --> 05:07:03.171
TO SHORTEN THE AMOUNT OF TIME SO

05:07:03.238 --> 05:07:04.839
IT REMAINS EFFECTIVE BECAUSE THE

05:07:04.906 --> 05:07:05.940
THE TIME THE STATE'S OTHER

05:07:06.007 --> 05:07:06.508
PROTESTERS.

05:07:06.574 --> 05:07:07.142
PROTECTION ACTUALLY LAST IS AS

05:07:07.208 --> 05:07:07.809
LONG AS THE OLD ONE SO THE

05:07:07.876 --> 05:07:09.110
RECOMMENDATION STILL BASED ON

05:07:09.177 --> 05:07:11.012
THE OLD -- THE PERSISTENCE OF

05:07:11.079 --> 05:07:12.247
IMMUNITY OF THE PREVIOUS

05:07:12.313 --> 05:07:14.282
VACCINATION AND SO THAT'S WHY WE

05:07:14.349 --> 05:07:16.484
REVISE OUR RECOMMENDATIONS BASED

05:07:16.551 --> 05:07:18.019
ON IT AN IMPROVED DATA THAT

05:07:18.086 --> 05:07:19.487
DOESN'T MEAN THE VACCINE DOESN'T

05:07:19.554 --> 05:07:21.389
WORK IT JUST MEANS THAT THE

05:07:21.456 --> 05:07:21.990
VACCINE.

05:07:22.056 --> 05:07:23.324
WORKS IT WORKS THE WAY IT WORKS

05:07:23.391 --> 05:07:25.560
SO AND THAT AND SO WE'VE SIZE

05:07:25.627 --> 05:07:28.029
NEED TO MODIFY -- EXACTLY HOW WE

05:07:28.096 --> 05:07:29.597
ADMINISTER VACCINES MMR ON THE

05:07:29.664 --> 05:07:31.499
OTHER HAND -- ONCE YOU GET TO

05:07:31.566 --> 05:07:34.068
VACCINATIONS FOR MOST PART --

05:07:34.135 --> 05:07:36.437
WELL THERE'S THAT THAT WILL BE

05:07:36.504 --> 05:07:39.374
PROVIDE LIFETIME IMMUNITY -- TO

05:07:39.440 --> 05:07:41.075
TWO PEOPLE UNLESS YOU TO BECOME

05:07:41.142 --> 05:07:42.443
A NEW COMPROMISE FROM CANCER OR

05:07:42.510 --> 05:07:43.778
SOMETHING ELSE LATER ON IN LIFE

05:07:43.845 --> 05:07:45.079
SO THAT IN THAT CASE YOU JUST

05:07:45.146 --> 05:07:46.714
GET THE TO AND CHILDHOOD YOUR

05:07:46.781 --> 05:07:48.483
GOOD IF YOU ONLY GET ONE THOUGH.

05:07:48.550 --> 05:07:49.417
USE THAT YOU'RE MORE VULNERABLE

05:07:49.484 --> 05:07:50.718
AND THAT'S WHAT WE SW FORTY

05:07:50.785 --> 05:07:53.087
WITH THAT -- FLIGHT ATTENDANT --

05:07:53.154 --> 05:07:55.190
WHO'S IN A COMA RIGHT NOW IT

05:07:55.256 --> 05:07:57.859
ISRAEL THEY ONLY RECEIVED ONE

05:07:57.926 --> 05:08:00.094
AND SO I TO AT ELEVEN ONE ELEVEN

05:08:00.161 --> 05:08:01.196
CHANCE OF DEVELOPING THE DISEASE.

05:08:01.262 --> 05:08:02.697
THANK YOU AM I JUST HAVE TWO

05:08:02.764 --> 05:08:03.998
MORE QUESTIONS AND I DO

05:08:04.065 --> 05:08:04.766
APOLOGIZE A BECAUSE I KNOW WE'VE

05:08:04.833 --> 05:08:05.500
BEEN HERE.

05:08:05.567 --> 05:08:07.335
A REALLY LONG TIME YOU TALKED

05:08:07.402 --> 05:08:09.304
ABOUT THE THE ISSUES THE SIGN

05:08:09.370 --> 05:08:10.905
BEHIND YOU THAT SAYS THAT THERE

05:08:10.972 --> 05:08:12.907
ARE YOU KNOW BAD APPLES IN THE

05:08:12.974 --> 05:08:14.609
PHYSICIAN INDUSTRY.

05:08:14.676 --> 05:08:17.478
I AGREE WITH SENATOR LABOR THAT

05:08:17.545 --> 05:08:18.213
WE TEND TO LEGISLATE.

05:08:18.279 --> 05:08:19.814
YOU KNOW REGARDING THE ACTIONS

05:08:19.881 --> 05:08:21.583
OF BAD APPLES OR PEOPLE THAT --

05:08:21.649 --> 05:08:23.184
ARE BAD ACTORS IN IN PARTICULAR

05:08:23.251 --> 05:08:25.253
INDUSTRIES AND THEN WE KIND OF

05:08:25.320 --> 05:08:26.554
THROW THE BABY OUT WITH THE BATH

05:08:26.621 --> 05:08:28.656
WATER I GUESS IS THE BETTER

05:08:28.723 --> 05:08:30.391
STATEMENT THAT I WOULD THINK IF.

05:08:30.458 --> 05:08:32.861
AND I A I REALLY THINK THAT THIS

05:08:32.927 --> 05:08:34.229
IN MY PERCEPTION I BELIEVE AND I

05:08:34.295 --> 05:08:35.096
UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT

05:08:35.163 --> 05:08:36.397
THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL BOARD NOT

05:08:36.464 --> 05:08:37.765
BEING ABLE TO GO AFTER THESE BAD

05:08:37.832 --> 05:08:38.433
ACTORS.

05:08:38.499 --> 05:08:39.934
BUT TO ME THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE

05:08:40.001 --> 05:08:42.370
THERE FOR I MEAN THERE THERE TO

05:08:42.437 --> 05:08:45.440
GO AFTER THE BAD MEDICAL ACTORS

05:08:45.506 --> 05:08:46.608
SO I DON'T SEE WHY THEY CAN'T

05:08:46.674 --> 05:08:53.248
ONE FACE THAT CAN SEE THAT.

05:08:53.314 --> 05:08:54.616
IN AND GO INTO THE THIS

05:08:54.682 --> 05:08:55.950
FACILITIES AND CHECK THOSE BAD

05:08:56.017 --> 05:08:57.785
ACTORS DOWN BEFORE WE VIOLATE

05:08:57.852 --> 05:08:58.419
THE RIGHTS APPEARANCE.

05:08:58.486 --> 05:09:01.322
AND TO CHOOSE WHETHER THEY THEY

05:09:01.389 --> 05:09:02.357
WANT THEIR KIDS VACCINATED OR

05:09:02.423 --> 05:09:04.092
HAVE THESE THESE VACCINES.

05:09:04.158 --> 05:09:05.059
I MEAN JUST I MEAN INSERTED INTO

05:09:05.126 --> 05:09:06.861
THEIR KIDS I GUESS -- WHEN THEY

05:09:06.928 --> 05:09:09.497
FEEL THAT THEIR KIDS ARE --

05:09:09.564 --> 05:09:11.132
MEDICALLY FLORA JEWEL OR LIKE

05:09:11.199 --> 05:09:13.134
MISS MITCHELL SAID AND A VARIETY

05:09:13.201 --> 05:09:16.037
OF REASONS THAT WILL -- PUT

05:09:16.104 --> 05:09:17.305
THEIR KIDS AT RISK.

05:09:17.372 --> 05:09:19.507
SO -- AND YOU SAY THERE'S NO WAY

05:09:19.574 --> 05:09:21.342
THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL BOARD CAN

05:09:21.409 --> 05:09:23.077
REGULATE THESE BAD ACTORS WELL

05:09:23.144 --> 05:09:24.045
IT SAYS IT AND SAY IT'S VERY

05:09:24.112 --> 05:09:25.613
DIFFICULT WHAT HAD MULTIPLE

05:09:25.680 --> 05:09:28.216
pBOARD OF CALIFORNIA.

05:09:28.283 --> 05:09:29.584
AND IT'S IT'S SUCH AS I POINT

05:09:29.651 --> 05:09:30.985
OUT THE REASON I'M DOING THIS

05:09:31.052 --> 05:09:31.819
BILL.

05:09:31.886 --> 05:09:33.688
IS NOT JUST TO STAMP OUT THE BAD

05:09:33.755 --> 05:09:34.989
ACTORS THIS RESULT OF THE BAD

05:09:35.056 --> 05:09:36.491
ACTORS WE HAVE SCHOOLS LIKE

05:09:36.557 --> 05:09:37.825
CENTER MINE MENTIONED HE HAS ONE

05:09:37.892 --> 05:09:39.894
THAT IT'S ONLY. 70% VACCINATED

05:09:39.961 --> 05:09:40.929
WE THERE'S A SCHOOL THEIR

05:09:40.995 --> 05:09:43.364
SCHOOLS ARE AS LOW AS 50% YOU

05:09:43.431 --> 05:09:44.666
KNOW THE LA TIMES DOCUMENT

05:09:44.732 --> 05:09:45.867
NUMEROUS SCHOOLS THAT HAD

05:09:45.934 --> 05:09:48.202
MEDICAL EXEMPTION RATES ABOVE

05:09:48.269 --> 05:09:48.803
20%.

05:09:48.870 --> 05:09:49.871
SO THAT MEANS IN THE OUTBREAKS

05:09:49.938 --> 05:09:51.706
OR ANYTHING IN THE SCHOOLS WHILE

05:09:51.773 --> 05:09:53.308
WE'RE WAITING FOR ONE SOME DAY I

05:09:53.374 --> 05:09:54.309
MEAN THAT ACTUALLY ONE WHAT

05:09:54.375 --> 05:09:56.210
HAPPENED I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S

05:09:56.277 --> 05:09:57.312
WHAT WILL HAPPEN.

05:09:57.378 --> 05:09:58.379
I MEAN THAT THAT'S WHAT WE DO IS

05:09:58.446 --> 05:10:00.081
OUR MITCHELL SAID WE DO THIS FOR

05:10:00.148 --> 05:10:01.582
PREVENTION ONCE THE OUTBREAK

05:10:01.649 --> 05:10:03.184
HAPPENS IT'S HARD TO CATCH UP

05:10:03.251 --> 05:10:04.419
AND I THINK CERTAINLY A PUBLIC

05:10:04.485 --> 05:10:06.487
HEALTH OFFICE CAN TALK ABOUT THE

05:10:06.554 --> 05:10:07.722
EXPENSE TO THE TAXPAYER.

05:10:07.789 --> 05:10:09.357
WHEN AN OUTBREAK HAPPENS AND WE

05:10:09.424 --> 05:10:11.993
TRY TO TRACE PEOPLE AND HAVE TO

05:10:12.060 --> 05:10:12.660
TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CONTAIN

05:10:12.727 --> 05:10:13.561
IT AND THE DAMAGE IS DONE WE

05:10:13.628 --> 05:10:14.729
WANT TO TRY TO PREVENT THE

05:10:14.796 --> 05:10:17.031
DAMAGE NOT WAIT TILL IT HAPPENS --

05:10:17.098 --> 05:10:18.299
I THINK TOO OFTEN WE DO THAT AND

05:10:18.366 --> 05:10:19.067
GOVERNMENT WE WAIT TILL

05:10:19.133 --> 05:10:20.501
SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS I THINK

05:10:20.568 --> 05:10:21.803
THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE

05:10:21.869 --> 05:10:23.304
PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING AND

05:10:23.371 --> 05:10:24.672
THAT'S WHY WE'RE DOING THIS ARE

05:10:24.739 --> 05:10:26.307
THESE RATES GOING DOWN I HAVE

05:10:26.374 --> 05:10:27.275
DATA HERE THAT SAYS THEY'VE GONE

05:10:27.342 --> 05:10:30.111
FROM TWO POINT 7% TO FOUR POINT.

05:10:30.178 --> 05:10:34.382
7% -- IN THIS SMALL GROUP OF SO

05:10:34.449 --> 05:10:35.249
THE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS OF MORE

05:10:35.316 --> 05:10:37.218
TROUBLE THEY USED TO BE POINT TO

05:10:37.285 --> 05:10:38.886
THEIR OVER WENT UP TO POINT.

05:10:38.953 --> 05:10:39.587
SEVEN THAT'S WHAT THE MEDICAL

05:10:39.654 --> 05:10:41.122
EXEMPTION RATE HAS GONE UP THE

05:10:41.189 --> 05:10:42.924
OVERALL VACCINATION RATE.

05:10:42.991 --> 05:10:45.126
IN THE STATE BECAUSE A TWO SEVEN

05:10:45.193 --> 05:10:46.427
SEVEN HAS GONE UP SO SU SEVEN

05:10:46.494 --> 05:10:48.096
SAYS BEEN X. S. SUCCESS BUT THE

05:10:48.162 --> 05:10:49.130
PROBLEM IS IT'S NOT THE STATE

05:10:49.197 --> 05:10:50.665
WIDE RATE THAT MATTERS.

05:10:50.732 --> 05:10:51.666
IS THE RATE IN PARTICULAR

05:10:51.733 --> 05:10:53.067
SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES AND WHEN

CENTS 50% 80%.

05:11:07.115 --> 05:11:07.915
THAT'S WAY TOO LOW YOU GONNA

MUCH AND AGAIN MY SO MY LAST

05:12:14.248 --> 05:12:15.850
QUESTION IS IS IT ON ON APRIL

05:12:15.917 --> 05:12:17.085
FIRST THERE WAS -- SENATE

05:12:17.151 --> 05:12:17.585
BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS

05:12:17.652 --> 05:12:18.019
COMMITTEE HEARING.

05:12:18.086 --> 05:12:19.387
WHERE YOU MADE THE STATEMENT

05:12:19.454 --> 05:12:21.022
THAT IT WASN'T RIGHT FOR THE

05:12:21.089 --> 05:12:23.958
LEGISLATURE TRIP -- TO LEGISLATE

05:12:24.025 --> 05:12:27.762
THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE -- IS

05:12:27.829 --> 05:12:29.230
AT WORK BUT IS THAT WHAT WE'RE

05:12:29.297 --> 05:12:30.832
DOING NOW IS LEGISLATING THE

05:12:30.898 --> 05:12:33.201
PRACTICE OF MEDICINE NO OKAY

05:12:33.267 --> 05:12:34.235
THOUGH BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS

05:12:34.302 --> 05:12:35.636
FOR GRANTING MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS

05:12:35.703 --> 05:12:36.804
A PUBLIC HEALTH FUNCTION.

05:12:36.871 --> 05:12:38.306
THE PRIDE IT'S NOT DIAGNOSIS OR

05:12:38.372 --> 05:12:39.440
TREATMENT THIS.

05:12:39.507 --> 05:12:40.741
DECISION TO GRANT A MEDICAL

05:12:40.808 --> 05:12:42.710
EXEMPTION IS REALLY A FUNCTION

05:12:42.777 --> 05:12:46.948
OF PUBLIC HEALTH -- THE MEDICAL-EXEMPTION IS TO THE STATE'S PLEA

05:12:47.014 --> 05:12:49.150
TO KEEPS TO TO ALLOW CHILDREN.

05:12:49.217 --> 05:12:51.619
WHO HAVE A CONDITION?

05:12:51.686 --> 05:12:54.922
SO IT'S STILL ATTEND SCHOOL IN A

05:12:54.989 --> 05:12:56.591
WAY TO KEEP THEM SAFE.

05:12:56.657 --> 05:12:57.525
THIS IS ABOUT SAFETY RIGHT AND

05:12:57.592 --> 05:12:58.693
SO THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT WHEN

05:12:58.759 --> 05:13:00.128
PEOPLE FRAUD GENTLY.

05:13:00.194 --> 05:13:01.629
RIGHT MEDICAL CENTERS ARE NOT

05:13:01.696 --> 05:13:02.430
DOING IT FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE

05:13:02.497 --> 05:13:04.232
PATIENT TO DOING FOR THEIR OWN

05:13:04.298 --> 05:13:05.500
BENEFIT THEY'RE THEY'RE ACTUALLY

05:13:05.566 --> 05:13:06.501
UNDERMINING.

05:13:06.567 --> 05:13:07.869
THE SAFETY OF THE SCHOOLS FOR

05:13:07.935 --> 05:13:09.570
THE PEOPLE WHO GENUINELY NEED

05:13:09.637 --> 05:13:11.305
THE MEDICAL EXCEPTION AND THAT'S

05:13:11.372 --> 05:13:12.940
WHY THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY IS THE

05:13:13.007 --> 05:13:14.408
SPONSOR OF THIS BILL.

05:13:14.475 --> 05:13:16.911
IT'S THE CMA IT'S THE AMERICAN

05:13:16.978 --> 05:13:19.113
CAVEAT GET A DOCTOR'S THE ONE TO

05:13:19.180 --> 05:13:20.381
REPRESENT THE FEVER THE

05:13:20.448 --> 05:13:24.385
POSITIONS OF THE STATE THAT SAY

05:13:24.452 --> 05:13:25.653
WE NEED THIS.

05:13:25.720 --> 05:13:26.821
THIS PARTICULAR BILL THAT I'M

05:13:26.888 --> 05:13:27.788
TALKING ABOUT WOULD HAVE --

05:13:27.855 --> 05:13:29.790
PULLED LICENSES FROM PHYSICIANS

05:13:29.857 --> 05:13:31.893
THAT WERE BAD ACTORS.

05:13:31.959 --> 05:13:33.394
THIS BILL NO THIS BILL THAT I'M

05:13:33.461 --> 05:13:35.096
TALKING ABOUT WERE YOU SAID WE

05:13:35.163 --> 05:13:37.465
SHOULD LEGISLATE STUFF LIKE THAT.

05:13:37.532 --> 05:13:39.500
SO I GUESS I JUST THAT'S A

05:13:39.567 --> 05:13:41.102
LITTLE GOES A RIVET I MEAN WHAT

05:13:41.169 --> 05:13:41.969
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN THAT

05:13:42.036 --> 05:13:43.171
THAT CASE THAT'S ABOUT REMOVING

05:13:43.237 --> 05:13:45.106
LICENSES FROM THE PHYSICIANS

05:13:45.173 --> 05:13:46.174
RIGHT WELL I THINK THOSE PEOPLE

05:13:46.240 --> 05:13:47.708

FALLS -- MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS

05:13:56.250 --> 05:13:57.818
SHOULD GET THEIR LICENSE THREE

05:13:57.885 --> 05:13:58.686
RIGHT WELL.

I'M REALLY GLAD TO HEAR THAT

05:18:07.501 --> 05:18:09.470
THERE ARE SO MANY FAMILIES THAT

05:18:09.537 --> 05:18:11.739
HAVE THAT ACCESS TO THE HEALTH

05:18:11.806 --> 05:18:13.407
CARE THAT THEY HAVE THE DOCTORS

05:18:13.474 --> 05:18:15.509
WHO ARE CARING FOR THEM AND FOR

05:18:15.576 --> 05:18:16.777
THEIR CHILDREN'S.

05:18:16.844 --> 05:18:19.413
I AM SO I'M TRYING TO SEE THE

05:18:19.480 --> 05:18:21.081
CONNECTION BETWEEN ALL OF THIS

05:18:21.148 --> 05:18:22.783
BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME IT CAN'T

05:18:22.850 --> 05:18:25.052
BE ONE OR THE OTHER IT CAN BE.

05:18:25.119 --> 05:18:27.188
YES WE WILL MOVE FORWARD BECAUSE

05:18:27.254 --> 05:18:29.790
OF VACCINATIONS IN THIS COUNTRY

05:18:29.857 --> 05:18:31.325
HOW MANY COUNTRIES.

05:18:31.392 --> 05:18:33.494
AROUND THE WORLD WOULD LOVE TO

05:18:33.561 --> 05:18:35.963
HAVE OUR RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO

05:18:36.030 --> 05:18:37.665
DO THAT.

05:18:37.731 --> 05:18:39.600
BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE

05:18:39.667 --> 05:18:41.735
INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF SOME

05:18:41.802 --> 05:18:44.171
FAMILIES AND SOME CHILDREN SO I

05:18:44.238 --> 05:18:47.942
GUESS YOU KNOW I'M TRYING TO SEE.

05:18:48.008 --> 05:18:49.710
WHERE ONE COMMUNITY?

05:18:49.777 --> 05:18:51.912
AND AND AND PEOPLE WE DON'T LIVE

05:18:51.979 --> 05:18:55.249
IN ISOLATION FROM EACH OTHER --

05:18:55.316 --> 05:18:57.618
AND SO WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS CARE.

05:18:57.685 --> 05:18:59.854
FOR EACH OTHER.

05:18:59.920 --> 05:19:02.089
AND A SO I'M I'M TRYING.

05:19:02.156 --> 05:19:03.757

05:19:05.025 --> 05:19:07.495
SUMMARIZE THAT IN IN A WAY THAT

05:19:07.561 --> 05:19:09.163
MAKES MORE SENSE SO LET LET LT

05:19:09.230 --> 05:19:09.964
ME.

05:19:10.030 --> 05:19:11.499
GO BACK A LITTLE BIT HISTORY

05:19:11.565 --> 05:19:14.101
BECAUSE YOU'RE FROM LOS ANGELES --

05:19:14.168 --> 05:19:16.103
THERE WAS A LARGE OUTBREAK OF

05:19:16.170 --> 05:19:18.405
MEASLES -- IN LOS ANGELES IN THE

05:19:18.472 --> 05:19:19.673
LATE EIGHTIES I THINK IT WENT ON

05:19:19.740 --> 05:19:21.709
FOR ALMOST A YEAR AND A HALF OR%

05:19:21.775 --> 05:19:22.409
TWO YEARS.

05:19:22.476 --> 05:19:23.511
THE FORTY OR ABLE TO CONTAIN AND

05:19:23.577 --> 05:19:26.213
THAT WAS BECAUSE AT THAT TIME --

05:19:26.280 --> 05:19:27.314
WE DID NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT

05:19:27.381 --> 05:19:30.651
ACCESS TO VACCINATIONS FOR LOW

05:19:30.718 --> 05:19:32.152
INCOME CHILDREN IN FACT AS A

05:19:32.219 --> 05:19:33.487
RESULT OF NOT ONLY THAT OPERATE

05:19:33.554 --> 05:19:35.022
BUT OTHER OUTBREAKS -- THE

05:19:35.089 --> 05:19:36.323

MEDICAID PROGRAM TO MEDI CAL

05:19:40.327 --> 05:19:42.162
HERE IN CALIFORNIA. TOO LOW

05:19:42.229 --> 05:19:45.065
INCOME CHILDREN -- SO -- SO THAT

05:19:45.132 --> 05:19:47.635
WAS THE PREVIOUS PROBLEM WE HAD

05:19:47.701 --> 05:19:49.103
WE SAID -- MEASLES OUTBREAKS THE

05:19:49.169 --> 05:19:50.170
PROBLEM WAS IS LOW INCOME

05:19:50.237 --> 05:19:51.272
CHILDREN WERE GETTING ACCESS TO

05:19:51.338 --> 05:19:52.239
HEALTH CARE TO COULDN'T GET

05:19:52.306 --> 05:19:54.008

05:19:54.074 --> 05:19:56.076
WE HAD THE THANK YOU VERY LARGE

05:19:56.143 --> 05:20:01.482
OUTBREAK IN IN LOS ANGELES -- I

05:20:01.549 --> 05:20:02.116
WAS ACTUALLY IS A MEDICAL

05:20:02.182 --> 05:20:03.083
STUDENT IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE

PRESENT IN A OUTBREAK OF MEASLES

05:20:04.952 --> 05:20:06.287
AND PHILADELPHIA.

05:20:06.353 --> 05:20:08.355
IN THAT CASE -- THERE WERE A

05:20:08.422 --> 05:20:11.258
COUPLE OF I GUESS RELIGIOUS

05:20:11.325 --> 05:20:12.960
GROUPS THAT -- DIDN'T BELIEVE IN

05:20:13.027 --> 05:20:14.995

05:20:27.641 --> 05:20:30.277
OUT THAT IN THE CITY AT THE TIME.

05:20:30.344 --> 05:20:32.046
HALF OF THE PEOPLE WERE MEMBERS

05:20:32.112 --> 05:20:33.213
OF OUR WAS SO SILLY AND WITH

05:20:33.280 --> 05:20:34.214
THOSE RELIGIOUS GROUPS THE OTHER

05:20:34.281 --> 05:20:35.950
HALF OR NOT BECAUSE YOU SAID

05:20:36.016 --> 05:20:37.518
WE'RE ALL ONE COMMUNITY.

05:20:37.585 --> 05:20:39.486
RIGHT AND ULTIMATELY I MEAN THIS

05:20:39.553 --> 05:20:40.788
IS THIS IS WHAT IT'S ABOUT

05:20:40.854 --> 05:20:41.589
BECAUSE THESE ARE VERY

05:20:41.655 --> 05:20:43.357
CONTAGIOUS DISEASES THEY SPREAD.

05:20:43.424 --> 05:20:44.858
SO I TALKED ABOUT WELL BADGING

05:20:44.925 --> 05:20:46.293
YOU HAVE A SCHOOL THAT HAS LOW

05:20:46.360 --> 05:20:47.828
VACCINATION RATE SOMEONE BRINGS

05:20:47.895 --> 05:20:49.964
IN MEASLES THEY GO ON A TRIP OR

05:20:50.030 --> 05:20:51.432
SOMETHING COME BACK NOW IT.

05:20:51.498 --> 05:20:52.666
IS TRANSMITTED TO ALL THE OTHER

05:20:52.733 --> 05:20:53.867
KIDS IN THE SCHOOL BECAUSE

05:20:53.934 --> 05:20:55.636
BEFORE TO GET SYMPTOMS RIGHT AND

05:20:55.703 --> 05:20:57.204
THEN THOSE KIDS ARE ALL GOING

05:20:57.271 --> 05:20:58.772
OUT AND THEY'RE GOING HOME AND

05:20:58.839 --> 05:21:00.174
THEN TO GOING GROCERY SHOPPING

05:21:00.240 --> 05:21:01.442
WITH THEIR PARENTS ETCETERA.

05:21:01.508 --> 05:21:02.543
THEN WHAT HAPPENS YOU HAVE A

05:21:02.610 --> 05:21:04.411
HUGE OUTBREAK BECAUSE BASICALLY

05:21:04.478 --> 05:21:06.146
THE LOW VACCINATION RATES AS I

05:21:06.213 --> 05:21:08.248
MENTIONED MY AN OPENING IS LIKE

05:21:08.315 --> 05:21:10.284
TO TENDER FOR A WHAT YOU KNOW

05:21:10.351 --> 05:21:12.119
OUTBREAK WILD FIRE.

05:21:12.186 --> 05:21:12.753
RIGHT SO THEY COULD DO WANT TO

05:21:12.820 --> 05:21:13.988
GET BECAUSE PICKS UP STEAM AND

05:21:14.054 --> 05:21:14.622
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN

05:21:14.688 --> 05:21:15.823
PHILADELPHIA AND THAT'S ALSO

05:21:15.889 --> 05:21:16.657
WHAT HAPPENED LOS ANGELES AND

05:21:16.724 --> 05:21:18.192
WHEN HE PICKS UP STEAM IT'S

05:21:18.258 --> 05:21:19.426
REALLY HARD TO CONTAIN.

05:21:19.493 --> 05:21:20.761
BECAUSE THIS THING JUST SPREADS

05:21:20.828 --> 05:21:22.062
RAPIDLY SO YOU WANT IS YOU WANT

05:21:22.129 --> 05:21:23.464
STANFORD OUT RIGHT WAIT JUST

05:21:23.530 --> 05:21:25.466
LIKE OF WILD FIRE YOU UNDERSTAND

05:21:25.532 --> 05:21:26.667
THAT WHEN THE FLAME IS SMALL

05:21:26.734 --> 05:21:27.735
BECAUSE I TIME IT'S RUSSIAN UP

05:21:27.801 --> 05:21:28.502
THE HILL.

05:21:28.569 --> 05:21:30.170
AND IT'S BURNING THE BIG TREES

05:21:30.237 --> 05:21:31.905
RIGHT THE IT'S REALLY HARD TO

05:21:31.972 --> 05:21:33.907
STOP AND THAT'S WHY WE WANT TO

05:21:33.974 --> 05:21:35.175
TAKE THE STEPS TO BE SURE WE

05:21:35.242 --> 05:21:36.710
DON'T HAVE THESE POCKETS OF LOW

05:21:36.777 --> 05:21:37.711
VACCINATION.

05:21:37.778 --> 05:21:39.546
THAT THEN BECOME THE TENDER TO

05:21:39.613 --> 05:21:40.914
LEAD TO THE FUEL IT OUTBREAK

05:21:40.981 --> 05:21:41.615
THAT TENDS GONNA TAKE A

05:21:41.682 --> 05:21:42.983
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF EFFORT TO

05:21:43.050 --> 05:21:44.652
STOP AND MORE IMPORTANTLY IS

05:21:44.718 --> 05:21:46.687
GOING TO SECOND AND POTENTIALLY

05:21:46.754 --> 05:21:48.055
YOU KNOW HOT WILL CERTAINLY

05:21:48.122 --> 05:21:49.523
HOSPITALIZED MEUSEL HOPLITES OUT

05:21:49.590 --> 05:21:50.691
ONE IN FIVE PEOPLE.

05:21:50.758 --> 05:21:51.959
AND MAYBE EVEN KILL SOMEONE

05:21:52.026 --> 05:21:53.460
WE'RE FORTUNATE SO FAR NO ONE

05:21:53.527 --> 05:21:54.795
HAS DIED OF WELL LET'S SEE WE'VE

05:21:54.862 --> 05:21:55.996
HAD A COUPLE PEOPLE DIED OF

05:21:56.063 --> 05:21:58.699
MEASLES IN THE LAST SINCE.

05:21:58.766 --> 05:21:59.566
TWENTY TWO THOUSAND BUT YOU KNOW

05:21:59.633 --> 05:22:00.868
THANKS TO THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY

05:22:00.934 --> 05:22:01.969
BEING VERY AGGRESSIVE ABOUT

05:22:02.036 --> 05:22:03.437
TREATING PEOPLE WE FORTUNATELY

05:22:03.504 --> 05:22:04.672
NOT HAD.

05:22:04.738 --> 05:22:12.079
OTHER DEATHS BUT I BUT I CAN'T

05:22:12.146 --> 05:22:14.081
GUARANTEE THAT WON'T HAPPEN.

05:22:14.148 --> 05:22:15.015
I WOULD HAVE TO BY THE WAY

05:22:15.082 --> 05:22:15.582
SEVENTY EIGHTY DEBTS AND IN

05:22:15.649 --> 05:22:18.052
EUROPE LAST YEAR FOR MEASLES.

05:22:18.118 --> 05:22:21.055
DID YOU WANT TO SEND RUBIO.

05:22:21.121 --> 05:22:22.156
AND I KNOW THIRTY BEEN A LONG

05:22:22.222 --> 05:22:23.691
DAY SO TRY AND SPEAK FAST AND

05:22:23.757 --> 05:22:24.692
KEEP IT SHORT BUT FOR SO I JUST

05:22:24.758 --> 05:22:25.526
WANTED KNOWLEDGE OF THE PARENTS

05:22:25.592 --> 05:22:26.193
AND EVERYONE THAT'S HERE.

05:22:26.260 --> 05:22:27.528
SPEAKING EITHER IN ALL FOR IT OR

05:22:27.594 --> 05:22:28.128
AGAINST IT I KNOW IT'S A YOU

05:22:28.195 --> 05:22:28.996
KNOW PEOPLE COME FROM FAR AWAY

05:22:29.063 --> 05:22:30.264
SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

05:22:30.330 --> 05:22:31.965
VALIDATE YOU KNOW EVERYONE

05:22:32.032 --> 05:22:32.466
THAT'S HERE AND THEY'RE

05:22:32.533 --> 05:22:33.434
CONCERNED SO.

05:22:33.500 --> 05:22:35.169
I JUST HAVE TO VERIFICATION

05:22:35.235 --> 05:22:36.503
QUESTIONS AND I AND I KNOW THAT

05:22:36.570 --> 05:22:37.504
YOU'VE SAID SO MUCH THROUGHOUT

05:22:37.571 --> 05:22:38.605
THE BEES HOURS BUT FOR ME

05:22:38.672 --> 05:22:40.274
THERE'S SOMETHING THAT I KIND OF

05:22:40.340 --> 05:22:42.209
MISS DAN DI CAN YOU CLARIFY FOR

05:22:42.276 --> 05:22:43.877
ME -- HOW HOW DO YOU HANDLE THE

05:22:43.944 --> 05:22:45.813
SITUATION WHEN THERE'S A FAMILY

05:22:45.879 --> 05:22:47.781
THAT ALREADY HAS A HISTORY OF?

05:22:47.848 --> 05:22:49.283
OF VACCINE INJURY LIKE HOW DO

05:22:49.349 --> 05:22:52.853
YOU PROCEED IN TERMS OF THEIR

05:22:52.920 --> 05:22:54.455
CHILD THE NEXT GENERATION IS

05:22:54.521 --> 05:22:55.255
THERE SOMETHING ALSO CERTAINLY

05:22:55.322 --> 05:22:57.958
DEPENDS -- IT DEPENDS ON THE SO

05:22:58.025 --> 05:22:59.626
FIRST OF ALL YOU'VE HEARD SOME

05:22:59.693 --> 05:23:00.527
PEOPLE SAY THE CHILD IS A

05:23:00.594 --> 05:23:01.495
VACCINE ENTRY INTO MENTIONED

05:23:01.562 --> 05:23:02.963
THAT THAT'S AUTISM AND

05:23:03.030 --> 05:23:04.298
UNFORTUNATELY.

05:23:04.364 --> 05:23:05.699
THE EVIDENCE IS NOT THE OF THE

05:23:05.766 --> 05:23:07.000
EVIDENCE HAS SHOWN NUMEROUS

05:23:07.067 --> 05:23:08.402
STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT AUTISM

05:23:08.469 --> 05:23:11.171
IS NOT REALLY TO VACCINES SO WE

05:23:11.238 --> 05:23:13.073
I THINK WE HAVE TO SEPARATE --

05:23:13.140 --> 05:23:14.541
THINGS THAT ARE ACTUALLY RELATE

05:23:14.608 --> 05:23:15.976
TO VACCINES FROM THINGS THAT MAY

05:23:16.043 --> 05:23:17.945
NOT BE -- THAT'S BASED ON THE

05:23:18.011 --> 05:23:20.647
EVIDENCE -- THE THE OTHER THING

05:23:20.714 --> 05:23:22.049
I WOULD SAY IS THAT WE DO HAVE

05:23:22.116 --> 05:23:23.417
WE DO THERE IS EXTENSIVE

05:23:23.484 --> 05:23:24.585
RESEARCH AND CONSUMING

05:23:24.651 --> 05:23:26.487
MONITORING OF VACCINATIONS

05:23:26.553 --> 05:23:27.921
VACCINES ARE MOST DOLLY

05:23:27.988 --> 05:23:29.323
EVALUATED BEFORE APPROVAL

05:23:29.389 --> 05:23:30.524
THERE'S CONSTANT MONITORING

05:23:30.591 --> 05:23:33.293
AFTERWARDS THERE'S THESE -- BASS

05:23:33.360 --> 05:23:35.329
VACCINE DATA SAFETY LINK THEIR

05:23:35.395 --> 05:23:36.697
MONITORING TO OBSERVE LOOKING AT

05:23:36.764 --> 05:23:37.998
RECORDS THROUGH -- LARGE

05:23:38.065 --> 05:23:39.633
ORGANIZATIONS LIKE KAISER SO FOR

05:23:39.700 --> 05:23:41.769
LOOKING FOR ANY POSSIBLE PATTERN

05:23:41.835 --> 05:23:42.536
OF ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BE

05:23:42.603 --> 05:23:43.837
RELATED TO THAT TWO TWO VACCINES

05:23:43.904 --> 05:23:45.639
AND THAT'S WHAT GOES INTO THESE

05:23:45.706 --> 05:23:47.174
GUIDELINES IN THE CONTRIBUTIONS

05:23:47.241 --> 05:23:48.342
AND PRECAUTIONS SO.

05:23:48.408 --> 05:23:49.710
CERTAINLY WE WANT TO BE SURE

05:23:49.777 --> 05:23:50.778
THAT ANY CHILD WHO ARE THERE'S

05:23:50.844 --> 05:23:53.247
EVEN A HINT OF A POTENTIAL RISK

05:23:53.313 --> 05:23:55.015
THAT MIGHT OCCUR BECAUSE OF ACTS

05:23:55.082 --> 05:23:57.084
VACCINATION THAT WE SEE ANY.

05:23:57.151 --> 05:23:58.685
CHANCE OF THAT THAT -- WE WOULD

05:23:58.752 --> 05:24:02.556
PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY -- FOR

05:24:02.623 --> 05:24:04.458
FOR THEM. ONE IMAGES -- BETTER

05:24:04.525 --> 05:24:06.059
BECAUSE I HEARD A LOT OF PARENTS

05:24:06.126 --> 05:24:07.828
COME UP FOR THEMSELVES AND HE

05:24:07.895 --> 05:24:08.796
SAID YOU KNOW IF THEY'RE ADULTS

05:24:08.862 --> 05:24:10.864
THEY SAID I'D HAVE BEEN VACCINE

05:24:10.931 --> 05:24:11.698
INJURED AND THEY HAVE TWO

05:24:11.765 --> 05:24:12.499
CHILDREN SAYING.

05:24:12.566 --> 05:24:13.467
THAT THAT ON A VACCINATE SO I

05:24:13.534 --> 05:24:14.768
JUST WANT TO KNOW LIKE TO

05:24:14.835 --> 05:24:16.203
DOCTORS TAKE THAT INTO

05:24:16.270 --> 05:24:17.538
CONSIDERATION CREATIONISTS THAT

05:24:17.604 --> 05:24:18.939
PERTAINS TO THE CHILDREN OF

05:24:19.006 --> 05:24:19.773
PEOPLE.

05:24:19.840 --> 05:24:21.642
IN ADULTS THAT ALREADY HAVE THAT

05:24:21.708 --> 05:24:22.643
EVIDENCE CERTAINLY IF THERE'S

05:24:22.709 --> 05:24:23.644
SOME IF THERE MIGHT BE SOME

05:24:23.710 --> 05:24:25.412
CONNECTION THERE THAT SOMETHING

05:24:25.479 --> 05:24:27.114
THAT WOULD -- BE TAKEN THAT

05:24:27.181 --> 05:24:28.115
CERTAINLY STAKING ACCOUNT

05:24:28.182 --> 05:24:30.217
LOOKING AT THE RESEARCH FOR

05:24:30.284 --> 05:24:38.425
EXAMPLE -- YOU KNOW PEOPLE EVEN

05:24:38.492 --> 05:24:39.626
BY THE WAY THEY DIDN'T STUDY.

05:24:39.693 --> 05:24:40.994
AUTISM RATES IN.

05:24:41.061 --> 05:24:43.230
CHILDREN AND SIBLINGS OF A

05:24:43.297 --> 05:24:43.864
FAMILIES THAT THEY HAVE OR HAVE

05:24:43.931 --> 05:24:45.065
AN AUTISTIC CHILDREN AND RELATE

05:24:45.132 --> 05:24:45.699
TO VACCINES AND FOUNDERS AGAIN

05:24:45.766 --> 05:24:46.700
NO CONNECTION BETWEEN VACCINES

05:24:46.767 --> 05:24:47.434
AND AUTISM -- SO EVEN IN THE

05:24:47.501 --> 05:24:48.802
SIBLINGS OF CHILDREN WHO HAVE

05:24:48.869 --> 05:24:50.404
AUTISM THE STUDY THAT SAID WELL

05:24:50.470 --> 05:24:51.004
MAYBE THEY MIGHT BE AT HIGHER

05:24:51.071 --> 05:24:52.139
RISK. FOR AUTISM RELATED TO

05:24:52.206 --> 05:24:53.607
VACCINES AND TURNS OUT THERE WAS

05:24:53.674 --> 05:24:55.108
NO ATTRACTION SO I MEAN THESE

05:24:55.175 --> 05:24:55.809
THINGS ARE BEING EXTENSIVELY

05:24:55.876 --> 05:24:56.677
STUDIED.

05:24:56.743 --> 05:24:57.911
THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I ALSO

05:24:57.978 --> 05:24:59.880
APPRECIATE -- I KNOW I HAD A

05:24:59.947 --> 05:25:01.715
CONCERN ABOUT AND WE SPOKE ABOUT

05:25:01.782 --> 05:25:02.683
THE APPEAL PROCESS YOU'LL

05:25:02.749 --> 05:25:03.784
PARENTS NOT.

05:25:03.851 --> 05:25:04.852
A FEELING THAT THEY WERE GOING

05:25:04.918 --> 05:25:06.153
TO BE HEARD AND SO CAN YOU JUST

05:25:06.220 --> 05:25:07.654
EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT WILL HAVE

05:25:07.721 --> 05:25:09.790
WHAT THT PROCESS LOOKS LIKE --

05:25:09.857 --> 05:25:12.793
SO SO BASICALLY -- YES I'M SORRY --

05:25:12.860 --> 05:25:14.361
SO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS IS THAT

05:25:14.428 --> 05:25:16.763
NGUYEN IF THE APPLICATION IS

05:25:16.830 --> 05:25:18.966
REJECTED THREE BILLION

05:25:19.032 --> 05:25:19.499
OPPORTUNITIES POSITION TO

05:25:19.566 --> 05:25:20.667
PROVIDE.

05:25:20.734 --> 05:25:21.935
LOOK AT THE REASON PROJECTION

05:25:22.002 --> 05:25:23.170
AND IT'S IT'S FRIED ADDITIONAL

05:25:23.237 --> 05:25:25.305
INFORMATION -- PERHAPS IT DID

05:25:25.372 --> 05:25:26.707
THE DAY FELT THAT THE PUBLIC

05:25:26.773 --> 05:25:29.042
HEALTH OFFICER DID NOT GET.

05:25:29.109 --> 05:25:30.143
THE FULL PICTURE OF THE ITEM AS

05:25:30.210 --> 05:25:31.144
YOU SENATE INITIAL ONE RIGHT AND

05:25:31.211 --> 05:25:32.646
YOU GO I THINK I PROVIDE ENOUGH

05:25:32.713 --> 05:25:34.014
INFORMATION AND THEN THEY'RE

05:25:34.081 --> 05:25:35.015
LIKE WELL MAYBE.

05:25:35.082 --> 05:25:36.049
AND IN VERSES THAT WILL KNOW AT

05:25:36.116 --> 05:25:37.117
BECAUSE ITAND SAID WELL

05:25:37.184 --> 05:25:38.352
ACTUALLY DIDN'T REALIZE ABOUT

05:25:38.418 --> 05:25:39.686
THIS SO I MEAN WE WANT TO GIVE

05:25:39.753 --> 05:25:40.888
THE OPPORTUNITY.

05:25:40.954 --> 05:25:42.723
AS AN OPPORTUNITY -- FOR TO BE

05:25:42.789 --> 05:25:44.258
SURE THAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH

05:25:44.324 --> 05:25:47.294
OFFICER HAS THE FULL PICTURE AND

05:25:47.361 --> 05:25:49.263
THE IN TERMS OF THE VALUATION

05:25:49.329 --> 05:25:49.897
AND WE DON'T WANT SOMEONE TO BE

05:25:49.963 --> 05:25:51.098
DENIED A MEDICAL EXEMPTION WHO

05:25:51.164 --> 05:25:53.033
MIGHT POSSIBLY ACTUALLY.

05:25:53.100 --> 05:25:54.701
NEED ONE SO WE WANT FOR A TREAT

05:25:54.768 --> 05:25:55.802
THOSE OPPORTUNITIES.

05:25:55.869 --> 05:25:56.904
AND AND I KNOW I'VE HEARD IT

EXAMPLE YOU HAVE ONE CHILD IS

YOUR IMMUNO COMPROMISED BECAUSE

05:30:29.042 --> 05:30:30.844

COURSE THEN THAT MAY BE A

05:30:32.145 --> 05:30:33.613
SITUATION WHERE WE WOULD SAY.

05:30:33.680 --> 05:30:34.981

05:30:36.149 --> 05:30:37.684
LET'S CHECK THE CHILD'S IMMUNE

05:30:37.751 --> 05:30:39.219
SYSTEM FIRST BEFORE WE WOULD DO

05:30:39.286 --> 05:30:40.620
THAT SO THERE THERE COULD BE

05:30:40.687 --> 05:30:42.489
CIRCUMSTANCES IN THAT THAT

05:30:42.556 --> 05:30:44.090
REGARD YES DEL FIVE YOU THE MOST

WHO SAT FEARING HANDLE HIS

05:30:51.665 --> 05:30:54.201
BUSINESS DURING THIS SEVENTY

05:30:54.267 --> 05:30:55.402

CHILDREN -- IN THE AUDIENCE I

05:30:59.873 --> 05:31:02.309
TIP MY HAT -- YOU KNOW THE

05:31:02.375 --> 05:31:03.877
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HAVE A RE

05:31:03.944 --> 05:31:13.119
HAVING A REACTION.

05:31:13.186 --> 05:31:13.687
TO THIS IS A CONCERN ABOUT A

05:31:13.753 --> 05:31:14.888
POTENTIAL.

05:31:14.955 --> 05:31:16.256
AUTO IMMUNE CONDITION THAT WOULD

05:31:16.323 --> 05:31:17.724
PREVENT SOMEONE FROM BEING --

05:31:17.791 --> 05:31:19.392
IMMUNIZED IN THE FIRST PLACE AND

05:31:19.459 --> 05:31:20.393
SO AS WE TALK ABOUT WHAT CHILD

05:31:20.460 --> 05:31:21.027
SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT OVER THE

05:31:21.094 --> 05:31:22.762
OTHER TO GO TO PUBLIC SCHOOL

05:31:22.829 --> 05:31:23.897
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO

05:31:23.964 --> 05:31:25.398
DIFFERENT POPULATIONS SOMEONE

05:31:25.465 --> 05:31:29.402
WHO HAD A UNFORTUNATE REACTION.

05:31:29.469 --> 05:31:32.472
VERSUS SOMEONE WHO HAS A

05:31:32.539 --> 05:31:34.975
POTENTIAL AUTO IMMUNE CONDITION

05:31:35.041 --> 05:31:36.409
OR SOMETHING THAT WOULD SUGGEST

05:31:36.476 --> 05:31:38.345
THAT THEY NOT BE IMMUNIZED IN

05:31:38.411 --> 05:31:39.646
THE FIRST PLACE FIRST.

05:31:39.713 --> 05:31:40.714
THAT'S WHERE I STARTED MY

05:31:40.780 --> 05:31:42.415
QUESTION REALLY TRYING TO GET

05:31:42.482 --> 05:31:44.251
THAT CLEAR DISTINCTION AND LET

05:31:44.317 --> 05:31:46.953
ME JUST SAY OF MADAME MR CHERRY

05:31:47.020 --> 05:31:47.921
BUT DOING A FABULOUS JOB I JUST

05:31:47.988 --> 05:31:49.322
WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THIS IS NOT

05:31:49.389 --> 05:31:50.323
WAVING.

05:31:50.390 --> 05:31:51.825
I SEE THAT WE'VE LOST OUR

05:31:51.891 --> 05:31:53.927
TRANSLATORS BUT THIS IS AMERICAN

05:31:53.994 --> 05:31:56.429
SIGN LANGUAGE FOR APPLAUSE SO I

05:31:56.496 --> 05:31:57.397
JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

05:31:57.464 --> 05:31:59.132
CLEAR ABOUT WHAT IT IS WE'RE

05:31:59.199 --> 05:32:00.700
DOING IS NOT WAVING.

RESPECT TO THE AFFORDABILITY OF

05:55:38.183 --> 05:55:38.684

05:55:51.596 --> 05:55:52.597
TROUBLESOME PRECEDENCE.

05:55:52.664 --> 05:55:54.132
IT REQUIRES TO COVER THESE DRUGS

05:55:54.199 --> 05:55:55.434
IN A MANNER THAT HAMSTRINGS ARE

05:55:55.500 --> 05:55:57.569

05:56:03.975 --> 05:56:04.409
OUR OBJECTION TO THESE

05:56:04.476 --> 05:56:06.244
PROVISIONS IS NOT BASED ON THE

05:56:06.311 --> 05:56:08.313
INTENDED GOAL OF THE BILL RATHER

05:56:08.380 --> 05:56:09.481
WE OPPOSE THE BILL BECAUSE IT

05:56:09.548 --> 05:56:10.549
REQUIRES OR THIS PROVISION OF

05:56:10.615 --> 05:56:11.450
THE PILL.

05:56:11.516 --> 05:56:13.251
A BECAUSE IT REQUIRES PLANS TO

05:56:13.318 --> 05:56:14.619
COVER THESE DRUGS IN A MANNER

05:56:14.686 --> 05:56:16.221
THAT PREVENTS US FROM BASING

COVERAGE POLICIES -- ON ON ON

05:56:18.457 --> 05:56:20.125
REASONABLE CONSIDERATIONS NOW

05:56:20.192 --> 05:56:21.393
JUST BY WAY OF A COUPLE OF

05:56:21.460 --> 05:56:23.929
EXAMPLES OF HOW REMOVING

05:56:23.995 --> 05:56:26.064
COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY REMOVING

05:56:26.131 --> 05:56:27.065
ANY.

05:56:27.132 --> 05:56:29.234
MEDICAL MANAGEMENT UTILIZATION

05:56:29.301 --> 05:56:30.302
MAN AND OF MANAGEMENT OF THESE

05:56:30.368 --> 05:56:32.237
DRUGS I'M COULD HAVE --

05:56:32.304 --> 05:56:34.906
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES -- ONE

05:56:34.973 --> 05:56:36.808
DRUG THAT IS USED -- FOR THE

05:56:36.875 --> 05:56:38.043
TREATMENT OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE

05:56:38.110 --> 05:56:39.978
DISORDERS BEEPING AFTER RAIN

05:56:40.045 --> 05:56:41.379
WHICH IS ALSO AN OPIOID.

05:56:41.446 --> 05:56:44.649
AND IS SUBJECT TO MISUSE -- IT

05:56:44.716 --> 05:56:46.551
IT ALSO COULD BE DEADLY FOR

05:56:46.618 --> 05:56:48.220
PATIENT IF IT IS MIXED WITH

05:56:48.286 --> 05:56:50.722
ANOTHER DRUG -- WHERE IT HAS A

05:56:50.789 --> 05:56:54.259
NEGATIVE INTERACTIONS SO YOU FOR

05:56:54.326 --> 05:56:57.562
EXAMPLE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT --

05:56:57.629 --> 05:56:59.131
BEN'S WITH A DAY AS A TEEN IS IS

05:56:59.197 --> 05:56:59.898
A DRUG THAT -- IS COMMONLY USED

05:56:59.965 --> 05:57:01.032
FOR MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS AS

05:57:01.099 --> 05:57:02.567
WELL -- YOU KNOW AS SUCH AS

05:57:02.634 --> 05:57:05.237
SCHIZOPHRENIA IF THAT IS USED

05:57:05.303 --> 05:57:06.238
WOULD BE DOT BEEPING AFRICAINE

05:57:06.304 --> 05:57:09.074
THAT COULD BE A VERY VERY --

05:57:09.141 --> 05:57:10.942
DISASTROUS SITUATION FOR THE

05:57:11.009 --> 05:57:12.677
PATIENT TAKING THAT THOSE TWO

05:57:12.744 --> 05:57:14.179
DRUGS IN COMBINATION THE HEALTH

05:57:14.246 --> 05:57:16.148
PLAN MIGHT BE THE ONLY ENTITY

05:57:16.214 --> 05:57:17.716
THAT HAS A LINE OF SIGHT ON TO

05:57:17.783 --> 05:57:18.583
ALL OF THE DRUGS.

05:57:18.650 --> 05:57:19.718
THAT A THAT A PERSON MIGHT BE

05:57:19.785 --> 05:57:22.387
TAKING PARTICULAR THAT PERSON'S

05:57:22.454 --> 05:57:24.222
GOING AT A NETWORK FOR TREATMENT --

05:57:24.289 --> 05:57:25.590
ON THESE DRUGS WERE VERY

05:57:25.657 --> 05:57:27.192
CONCERNED ABOUT SIDE EFFECTS AND

05:57:27.259 --> 05:57:29.094
WE THINK WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO

05:57:29.161 --> 05:57:31.696
MAINTAIN REASONABLE MEDICAL

05:57:31.763 --> 05:57:33.865
MANAGEMENT ON THESE DRUGS -- YOU

TRICKS OWN COMMONLY KNOWN AS

05:57:38.703 --> 05:57:39.938
VIVID TRAWL HAS A LOW

05:57:40.005 --> 05:57:41.640
EFFECTIVENESS RATES -- HOWEVER

05:57:41.706 --> 05:57:42.808
ACCORDING TO THIS BILL WE WOULD

05:57:42.874 --> 05:57:43.909
HAVE TO COVER IT WITHOUT ANY

05:57:43.975 --> 05:57:46.144
PRIOR AUTHORIZATION DESPITE THE

05:57:46.211 --> 05:57:47.546
FACT THAT IN MANY CASES -- IT

05:57:47.612 --> 05:57:49.514
MIGHT NOT WORK FOR A PATIENT --

05:57:49.581 --> 05:57:51.116
IT'S ALSO VERY EXPENSIVE WHICH

05:57:51.183 --> 05:57:52.384
GETS TO THE POINT OF THE

05:57:52.450 --> 05:57:53.051
PROVISION OF THE BILL THAT

05:57:53.118 --> 05:57:54.853
REQUIRES ALL SUBSTANCE ABUSE

05:57:54.920 --> 05:57:56.421
RELATED DRUGS TO BE COVERED ON

05:57:56.488 --> 05:57:57.722
THE LOWEST TIER.

05:57:57.789 --> 05:58:00.759
WITHOUT ANY REGARD TO COST ANY

05:58:00.826 --> 05:58:01.693
DRUG THAT WAS.

05:58:01.760 --> 05:58:03.829
APPROVED BY THE FDA HAS TO BE

05:58:03.895 --> 05:58:05.197
COVERED AT THE LOWEST HERE NO

05:58:05.263 --> 05:58:06.498
MATTER HOW EXPENSIVE IT IS NO

05:58:06.565 --> 05:58:08.633
MATTER WHAT IT WHETHER IT WORKS

05:58:08.700 --> 05:58:09.401
OR NOT SO MANY.

05:58:09.467 --> 05:58:10.936
THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF OF A

05:58:11.002 --> 05:58:12.304
NUMBER OF THE REALLY BAD

05:58:12.370 --> 05:58:14.105

06:08:45.236 --> 06:08:45.736
KIDS INSURANCE COMPANY OR MY

INSURANCE COMPANY WON'T PAY FOR

06:08:46.804 --> 06:08:47.805
TREATMENT.

06:08:47.872 --> 06:08:49.073
AND THEY CANNOT GET TREATMENT

06:08:49.140 --> 06:08:50.641
BECAUSE OF THE BARRIERS THAT

06:08:50.708 --> 06:08:52.710
STILL EXIST AND THAT IS WRONG

06:08:52.777 --> 06:08:54.979
AND AND I UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW WE

06:08:55.046 --> 06:08:56.347
GET CAUGHT UP IN THE THEN THE

06:08:56.414 --> 06:08:57.048
COST.

06:08:57.114 --> 06:08:58.583
AND I HEAR FROM INSURANCE

06:08:58.649 --> 06:08:59.317
COMPANIES THAT THAT THAT IT'S

06:08:59.383 --> 06:09:00.618
GOING TO BE THEN THEY'RE GONNA

06:09:00.685 --> 06:09:02.086
PUT THE COST ON TO CONSUMERS.

06:09:02.153 --> 06:09:03.921
YOU KNOW YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

06:09:03.988 --> 06:09:06.324

06:09:08.392 --> 06:09:10.695
IS NO COST THAT IS THAT.

06:09:10.761 --> 06:09:12.930
THAT MAKES A JUSTIFICATION FOR

06:09:12.997 --> 06:09:14.265
JUST THE PEOPLE THAT ARE BURIED

06:09:14.332 --> 06:09:15.867
IN THE LAST TWO YEARS.

06:09:15.933 --> 06:09:17.768

THE CHAMBER -- BUT I'M GONNA

06:09:42.527 --> 06:09:45.096
QUOTE FROM THE CHAMBERS LETTER

06:09:45.162 --> 06:09:50.735
THAT THE HIGHER PRICED DRUGS --

06:09:50.801 --> 06:09:51.836
NOT PROVIDING BENEFITS

06:09:51.903 --> 06:09:53.738
COMMENSURATE WITH THE COSTS YOU

06:09:53.804 --> 06:09:55.072

PHARMACOLOGY MEDICAL BENEFITS

06:09:59.844 --> 06:10:00.978
BETTER THAN THE PHYSICIANS THAT

06:10:01.045 --> 06:10:02.547
ARE WRITING FOR THE

06:10:02.613 --> 06:10:04.882
PRESCRIPTIONS I MEAN I'M JUST.

06:10:04.949 --> 06:10:07.118
OUTRAGE THAT -- THEY COULD MAKE

06:10:07.184 --> 06:10:07.718
A COMMENT LIKE THAT THEY CAN

06:10:07.785 --> 06:10:08.753
THEY CAN POSE IT CERTAINLY CAN

06:10:08.819 --> 06:10:10.187
OPPOSE IT BUT DON'T DON'T

06:10:10.254 --> 06:10:12.123
QUESTION THE THE THE

06:10:12.189 --> 06:10:13.391
PROFESSIONALISM OF THE PHYSICIAN

06:10:13.457 --> 06:10:14.458
THAT'S DOING THE BEST THEY CAN

06:10:14.525 --> 06:10:18.696
TO PROVIDE THE THE BEST THERAPY.

06:10:18.763 --> 06:10:19.297
FOR FOR IT FOR THEIR FR THEIR

PATIENTS -- IT LOOKS AS THOUGH

06:10:26.604 --> 06:10:31.642
THAT -- COSTS SEEMS.

06:10:31.709 --> 06:10:33.945
TO OVERRIDE -- CLINICAL EVIDENCE

06:10:34.011 --> 06:10:36.180
AFFECT EFFICACY WHEN THESE

06:10:36.247 --> 06:10:37.481
FORMULARIES ARE MADE AND I

06:10:37.548 --> 06:10:38.783

06:10:38.849 --> 06:10:41.319
THE BENEFITS OF TO THE INSURANCE

06:10:41.385 --> 06:10:44.455
COMPANY OF DOING THAT BUT IF WE

06:10:44.522 --> 06:10:45.823
HAVE A DRUG AND AND IF YOU AND

06:10:45.890 --> 06:10:47.425
PROBABLY WHEN YOU SEE THE HOW

06:10:47.491 --> 06:10:48.826
THE HIGHER TIER DRUGS.

06:10:48.893 --> 06:10:52.063
ON FORMULAR USE IN MOST CASES

06:10:52.129 --> 06:10:53.931

ARE EXPENSIVE I UNDERSTAND THAT --

06:12:12.076 --> 06:12:13.611
BUT WE HAVE A GROWING EPIDEMIC

06:12:13.678 --> 06:12:15.746

GETTING TH THEIR PRIOR

06:12:31.996 --> 06:12:33.964
AUTHORIZATIONS.

06:12:34.031 --> 06:12:34.932
THROUGH AND GETTING THEM

06:12:34.999 --> 06:12:36.367
APPROVED IN SOME CASES THE

06:12:36.434 --> 06:12:39.070
PATIENTS JUST COMPLETELY --

06:12:39.136 --> 06:12:40.971
ABANDON THE EFFORT OF TRYING TO

06:12:41.038 --> 06:12:42.473
GET THE DRUG BECAUSE OF SUCH A

06:12:42.540 --> 06:12:44.341
PROBLEM TO ANYWAY NECK I I KNOW

06:12:44.408 --> 06:12:45.743
I THROUGH A WHOLE LOT OF JUDAH I

06:12:45.810 --> 06:12:49.246
KNOW YOU HEARD REPRESENT YOUR

06:12:49.313 --> 06:12:51.248

06:12:51.315 --> 06:12:52.783
DO.

06:12:52.850 --> 06:12:53.751
TO THE ENSURE THAT WHEN SOMEBODY

06:12:53.818 --> 06:12:56.687
AS HAS AN OPIATE PROBLEM WHEN

06:12:56.754 --> 06:12:57.722
YOU GOT A CURRENT IT'S GOT A A

06:12:57.788 --> 06:12:58.723
CHILD IN IT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT

06:12:58.789 --> 06:12:59.056
TO DO.

06:12:59.123 --> 06:13:00.458
AND WE'VE GOT THESE GREAT DRUGS

06:13:00.524 --> 06:13:01.525
ON THE MARKET BUT WE WE WE WE

06:13:01.592 --> 06:13:03.027
GOT A BREAK THIS BUREAUCRATIC

06:13:03.094 --> 06:13:04.528
MORASS STUDY TO GET THEM THAT

06:13:04.595 --> 06:13:06.697
THE DRUGS THAT THEY DESPERATELY

06:13:06.764 --> 06:13:09.200
NEED AND DESERVE. ONE WE HAVE AN

06:13:09.266 --> 06:13:09.834
OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION

06:13:09.900 --> 06:13:10.401
ON THE BILL.

06:13:10.468 --> 06:13:12.737
AND SO I THINK IF WE ARE ABLE TO

06:13:12.803 --> 06:13:13.904
RETAIN.

06:13:13.971 --> 06:13:15.973
THE ABILITY TO USE A GENERIC

06:13:16.040 --> 06:13:17.308
INSTEAD OF A BRAND WHICH THE

06:13:17.374 --> 06:13:18.809
BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM DOES

06:13:18.876 --> 06:13:20.444
NOT ALLOW.

06:13:20.511 --> 06:13:21.946
THAT WOULD GO A LONG WAY IN IN

06:13:22.012 --> 06:13:23.881
THE VERY LIMITED CASES WHERE

06:13:23.948 --> 06:13:25.883
THERE IS AN IMPORTANT CLINICAL

06:13:25.950 --> 06:13:28.552
REASON. FOR US TO REVIEW THE

06:13:28.619 --> 06:13:31.222
APPROVAL OF THE MEDICATION AND

06:13:31.288 --> 06:13:32.456
FOR INSTANCE THE DRUG

06:13:32.523 --> 06:13:33.624
INTERACTION WHICH CAN KILL THE

06:13:33.691 --> 06:13:36.127
PATIENT THINGS LIKE THAT THEN I

06:13:36.193 --> 06:13:37.294
THINK THAT WOULD GO A LONG WAY

06:13:37.361 --> 06:13:38.729
IN ADDRESSING OUR CONCERNS.

06:13:38.796 --> 06:13:42.199
SO -- YOU KNOW OUR OUR POSITIONS

06:13:42.266 --> 06:13:46.837

06:15:28.239 --> 06:15:28.639
GREAT.

06:15:28.706 --> 06:15:30.875
UNTIL THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT YOU

06:15:30.941 --> 06:15:32.443
KNOW I HAVE A BILL TO MANDATE

06:15:32.509 --> 06:15:34.378
HEALTH COVERAGE WE'RE GOING TO

06:15:34.445 --> 06:15:36.347
TRY TO FUND SUBSIDIES FOR HEALTH

06:15:36.413 --> 06:15:40.117
INSURANCE -- AND SO WE WANT TO

06:15:40.184 --> 06:15:41.118
BE SURE PEOPLE GET ACCESS

06:15:41.185 --> 06:15:41.952
TREATMENT WHY OF COVERAGE YOU

06:15:42.019 --> 06:15:43.520

MECHANISMS TO TO TO TO TO HELP

06:15:47.858 --> 06:15:49.426
MODERATE. TO AN UPWARD PUSH ON

06:15:49.493 --> 06:15:52.129
PRICES OF JUST FOR EXAMPLE --

06:15:52.196 --> 06:15:52.930
YOU KNOW THE LOCKS ON WHICH

06:15:52.997 --> 06:15:54.632
COSTS A DOLLAR A DECADE AGO IS

06:15:54.698 --> 06:15:57.268
NOW A HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS AND

06:15:57.334 --> 06:15:59.503
THEN NOT INJECTORS FORD FOUR

06:15:59.570 --> 06:16:00.137
THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NOT WE CAN

06:16:00.204 --> 06:16:01.505
GO AND DEVELOP THE PHARMACY.

06:16:01.572 --> 06:16:02.373
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES OR

06:16:02.439 --> 06:16:06.944
SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT WE DON'T

06:16:07.011 --> 06:16:10.080

SEE THE THE HEALTH PLANS REPOSE

06:16:12.516 --> 06:16:13.784
IF THERE'S A GENERIC AVAILABLE.

06:16:13.851 --> 06:16:15.519
IS THAT SOMETHING YOU'D BE OPEN

06:16:15.586 --> 06:16:16.620
TO OR IS IT ACTUALLY HAS TO BE

06:16:16.687 --> 06:16:17.955
WHATEVER THE DOCTOR PRESCRIBES I

06:16:18.022 --> 06:16:19.256
MEAN I IN SOME WAYS I KIND OF

06:16:19.323 --> 06:16:21.025
LEAN TOWARD THAT BUT I HAVE TO

06:16:21.091 --> 06:16:22.693
SAY AS A POLICY MAKER I'M NOT

06:16:22.760 --> 06:16:27.298
SURE I CAN GO THAT FAR -- WHEN I

06:16:27.364 --> 06:16:29.500
GOT THE -- COMMITTEE MEMBER AND

06:16:29.566 --> 06:16:32.903
SO ON MONDAY DURING THE SESSION.

06:16:32.970 --> 06:16:34.672
AND I HAD A COUPLE DAYS TO

06:16:34.738 --> 06:16:36.507
REVIEW THEM -- AND I SAW THAT

06:16:36.573 --> 06:16:37.808
THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS PRETTY

06:16:37.875 --> 06:16:42.846
MUCH GOT IT THE BILL -- I

06:16:42.913 --> 06:16:44.448
DECIDED I WOULD ACCEPT.

06:16:44.515 --> 06:16:46.050
PART OF THE AMENDMENTS AND NOT

06:16:46.116 --> 06:16:48.118
ACCEPT THE PART OTHER PART OKAY

06:16:48.185 --> 06:16:50.454
SO MY MY PURPOSE TODAY IS TO GET

06:16:50.521 --> 06:16:51.488
THE COMMITTEE TO APPROVE.

06:16:51.555 --> 06:16:53.257
THE BILL.

06:16:53.324 --> 06:16:56.193
AS I'M SUGGESTING HOPEFULLY.

06:16:56.260 --> 06:16:58.595
AND IF YOU HAVE SOME FURTHER

06:16:58.662 --> 06:17:01.031
REFINEMENTS I'D BE HAPPY TO TALK

06:17:01.098 --> 06:17:03.233
TO PEOPLE I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM

06:17:03.300 --> 06:17:04.368
WITH THE OTHER AND NEVER HAVE.

06:17:04.435 --> 06:17:07.404
BUT QUITE FRANKLY -- WHEN I SAW

06:17:07.471 --> 06:17:08.639
THE COMMUNITY AMENDMENTS IT

06:17:08.706 --> 06:17:11.342
ACTUALLY MAKES IT WORSE THAN THE

06:17:11.408 --> 06:17:13.344
CURRENT SITUATION?

06:17:13.410 --> 06:17:15.512
THEN -- WE HAVE NOW IT ACTUALLY

06:17:15.579 --> 06:17:16.647
GOES BACKWARDS.

06:17:16.714 --> 06:17:18.415
IN CALIFORNIA GIVEN THE FACT

06:17:18.482 --> 06:17:20.184
THAT YOU ATTORNEY GENERAL'S HAVE

06:17:20.250 --> 06:17:21.852
GOTTEN CIGNA AND THE OTHER -- AT

06:17:21.919 --> 06:17:25.322
THE OTHER HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS

06:17:25.389 --> 06:17:28.659
BY A LAWSUIT. TO AGREE -- TO

06:17:28.726 --> 06:17:31.295
FULL OF MEDICALLY ASSISTED

06:17:31.362 --> 06:17:37.634
TREATMENT SO SO FOR ME -- YEAH I

06:17:37.701 --> 06:17:39.403
I'LL TALK YOU KNOW I'D LIKE TALK

06:17:39.470 --> 06:17:40.571
TO THESE GUYS -- FOR TWELVE

06:17:40.637 --> 06:17:42.573
YEARS THEY NEVER SUPPORT ANY OF

06:17:42.639 --> 06:17:44.541
OUR MENTAL HEALTH BILLS HOWEVER.

06:17:44.608 --> 06:17:50.748
WE CAN STILL TALK TO ON FOOD BUT

06:17:50.814 --> 06:17:51.849
AND AND I'M SURE THE OTHER

06:17:51.915 --> 06:17:52.649
PEOPLE WILL TOO BUT THE

06:17:52.716 --> 06:17:53.417
PRINCIPLE THAT I WANT TO I WANT

06:17:53.484 --> 06:17:54.451
TO GET YOU TO VOTE FOR TODAY

06:17:54.518 --> 06:17:55.552
THIS IS THE PRINCIPLE.

06:17:55.619 --> 06:17:57.654
THAT YOU SHOULD NOT IMPEDE.

06:17:57.721 --> 06:17:59.089
MEDICALLY ASSISTED TREATMENT FOR

06:17:59.156 --> 06:18:00.424
SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND THAT'S WHAT

06:18:00.491 --> 06:18:01.925
THIS BILL IS ABOUT THAT'S WHAT I

06:18:01.992 --> 06:18:03.394
WOULD LIKE YOU TO DO.

06:18:03.460 --> 06:18:05.029
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO HAVE THAT AS

06:18:05.095 --> 06:18:06.630
THE THE COMMITTEE'S

06:18:06.697 --> 06:18:09.333
RECOMMENDATION -- IF YOU HAVE

06:18:09.400 --> 06:18:11.435
SOME REFINEMENTS ON ON GENERICS

06:18:11.502 --> 06:18:12.202
ARE ALL THAT I'D BE WILLING TO

06:18:12.269 --> 06:18:14.471
TALK TO THIS THE FIRST TIME I'VE

06:18:14.538 --> 06:18:15.973
HEARD THAT THA'S AN IDEA LET'S

06:18:16.040 --> 06:18:17.808
TALK ABOUT IT -- THOSE ARE

06:18:17.875 --> 06:18:19.176
THINGS I CAN TALK ABOUT I'VE

06:18:19.243 --> 06:18:21.145
ALWAYS BEEN ABLE.

06:18:21.211 --> 06:18:24.982
TO WORK OUT TO THE ISSUES WITH.

06:18:25.049 --> 06:18:26.383
MY COLLABORATION WITH EVERYBODY

06:18:26.450 --> 06:18:28.352
IS CONCERNED ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH

06:18:28.419 --> 06:18:29.720
AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE.

06:18:29.787 --> 06:18:32.823
I THINK WE MADE SIGNIFICANT --

06:18:32.890 --> 06:18:35.993
CONCESSIONS. TO BE HONEST ABOUT

06:18:36.060 --> 06:18:40.364
IT I THINK THAT -- THE REPORTING.

06:18:40.431 --> 06:18:42.599
IS INADEQUATE IN THE STATE OF

06:18:42.666 --> 06:18:44.001
CALIFORNIA WE GOT AN ELF.

06:18:44.068 --> 06:18:45.069
IN TERMS OF OUR MENTAL HEALTH

06:18:45.135 --> 06:18:47.071
PROGRAMS.

06:18:47.137 --> 06:18:49.506
SO WE'RE NOT REPORTING.

06:18:49.573 --> 06:18:50.741
AND WE'RE NOT ENFORCING MENTAL

06:18:50.808 --> 06:18:52.609
HEALTH PARITY.

06:18:52.676 --> 06:18:54.578
IT'S NOT HAPPENING.

06:18:54.645 --> 06:18:57.648
BUT WHAT I'D LIKE TO GET THE

06:18:57.714 --> 06:18:58.882
COMMITTED DATE IS SUPPORT.

06:18:58.949 --> 06:19:00.284
MEDICALLY ASSISTED TREATMENT

06:19:00.350 --> 06:19:02.820
WITHOUT PRIOR AUTHORIZATION JUST

06:19:02.886 --> 06:19:03.420
LIKE ALL THE OTHER STATES ARE

06:19:03.487 --> 06:19:04.154
DOING.

06:19:04.221 --> 06:19:05.522
JUST LIKE ALL THE OTHER STATES

06:19:05.589 --> 06:19:06.356
ARE DOING THEY'RE ALL DOING IT.

06:19:06.423 --> 06:19:07.257
AND THEY'RE ALL DOING IT BECAUSE

06:19:07.324 --> 06:19:09.560
EVERY SINGLE NATIONAL

06:19:09.626 --> 06:19:10.527
ORGANISATION.

06:19:10.594 --> 06:19:12.629
CALLING THE MEDICAL ORGANIZATION.

06:19:12.696 --> 06:19:14.698
AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IS

06:19:14.765 --> 06:19:16.667
RECOMMENDING THAT.

06:19:16.733 --> 06:19:17.034
SO.

06:19:17.101 --> 06:19:20.871
THAT'S THAT'S MY RESPONSE I MEAN

06:19:20.938 --> 06:19:24.975

06:19:25.042 --> 06:19:29.313

THAT -- I THINK THERE ARE.

06:19:36.854 --> 06:19:39.156
ONLY TWO STATES TO HAVE LIMóN

06:19:39.223 --> 06:19:41.258

SHARE YOUR GOALS -- I I I I AM

06:19:46.230 --> 06:19:49.666
CONCERNED ABOUT THE LACK OF ANY.

06:19:49.733 --> 06:19:55.339
EFFORT TO TRY -- TO YES TRUTHS

06:19:55.405 --> 06:19:56.907
THE MECHANISMS TO TRY TO AT

06:19:56.974 --> 06:19:58.942
LEAST TO BE SURE THAT WE

06:19:59.009 --> 06:20:01.812
PRIORITIZE THE YOUNG WE WANT

06:20:01.879 --> 06:20:03.947

HAVING TO GO THROUGH ANY

06:20:14.591 --> 06:20:15.592
BARRIERS.

06:20:15.659 --> 06:20:17.394
I'M GOOD WITH THAT -- I THINK

06:20:17.461 --> 06:20:18.829
THE ISSUE IS IT'S A SAY THAT ANY

06:20:18.896 --> 06:20:24.868
SPLIT ANY POSSIBLE TREATMENT.

06:20:24.935 --> 06:20:26.537

06:20:48.859 --> 06:20:49.760
REASONABLE.

06:20:49.826 --> 06:20:52.362
MECHANISMS THAT STILL ALLOW

06:20:52.429 --> 06:20:53.797
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT ANY I WANT

06:20:53.864 --> 06:20:55.332

STRIKE A BETTER MIDDLE GROUND

06:21:01.805 --> 06:21:02.573
FOR WE STILL BE SURE PEOPLE

06:52:04.466 --> 06:52:05.834
PHARMACY IS NOT PERTINENT TO PUT

AFRAID OF DOING EVERY TIME

HOWEVER -- I DID HAVE TO TELL

07:01:25.827 --> 07:01:27.729
QUITE A FEW PEOPLE WHO CAME

OUTSIDE THAT TREATING POINTS.

07:01:41.676 --> 07:01:42.577
SO THESE PEOPLE IF HE HAD

TREATMENT THEY'LL BE RECEIVING

07:01:50.218 --> 07:01:52.453
SUB OPTIMAL TREATMENT FOR

07:01:52.520 --> 07:01:53.755
ESTABLISHED INFECTION THEY WON'T

07:01:53.821 --> 07:01:55.990
BE PROFIT LEXUS.

07:01:56.057 --> 07:01:56.591
AND THAT WOULD BE THE RISK OF

07:01:56.658 --> 07:01:57.258
INFECTION.

07:01:57.325 --> 07:01:59.927
ALSO SEE FREQUENTLY PEOPLE WHO

07:01:59.994 --> 07:02:01.462
HAD BEEN RUSHED.

07:02:01.529 --> 07:02:04.932
TO TREATMENT FOR AT THE HIV

07:02:04.999 --> 07:02:07.635
VIRUS BOARD PROPHYLAXIS WHEN

07:02:07.702 --> 07:02:11.639
THEY WERE NOT IN THE BRIGHT

07:02:11.706 --> 07:02:13.107
STATE JUST TO SEE THEM IN AND

07:02:13.174 --> 07:02:14.108
OUT AND REGIMEN WITH

07:02:14.175 --> 07:02:15.343
INTERRUPTIONS.

07:02:15.410 --> 07:02:20.148
AND THIS IS AN ENORMOUS FACTOR --

07:02:20.214 --> 07:02:21.049
FOR RESISTANCE AND LOSING

07:02:21.115 --> 07:02:22.684
DIFFICULTY OF THE TREATMENT AND

07:02:22.750 --> 07:02:24.052
THE STUDIES THAT WOULD BE WHERE.

07:02:24.118 --> 07:02:25.787
THE PIECES OF APPROVING PREP

07:02:25.853 --> 07:02:28.489
TREATMENT BY THE CDC AT TERRENCE.

07:02:28.556 --> 07:02:30.792
REEDY WAS THE MAIN FACTOR TO

07:02:30.858 --> 07:02:32.660
DETERMINE EFFICACY.

07:02:32.727 --> 07:02:33.394
AND OF COURSE LOSING THE

07:02:33.461 --> 07:02:34.962
EFFICACY OF THE MEDICATION WILL

07:02:35.029 --> 07:02:38.733
NOT ONLY -- MAKE A LOSS TO THE

07:02:38.800 --> 07:02:40.234
PEOPLE USING FOR PROPHYLAXIS BUT

07:02:40.301 --> 07:02:41.602
ALSO FOR THOSE TWO USING A FOR

07:02:41.669 --> 07:02:42.637
TREATMENT.

07:02:42.704 --> 07:02:48.109
THE SIDE EFFECTS ARE.

07:02:48.176 --> 07:02:49.177
REAL.

07:02:49.243 --> 07:02:50.244
AND ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NOT VERY

07:02:50.311 --> 07:02:51.112
FREQUENT WHEN THEY HAPPEN

07:02:51.179 --> 07:02:52.346
THEY'RE DIFFICULT TO TO

07:02:52.413 --> 07:02:53.981
RECOGNIZE BECAUSE A PROVIDERS

07:02:54.048 --> 07:02:55.016
WHO ARE NOT PRACTICING.

07:02:55.083 --> 07:02:56.718
IN THE AREA OF A CHEVY MAY NOT

07:02:56.784 --> 07:02:59.854
SEE IT EASILY AND IS NOT UNIQUE --

07:02:59.921 --> 07:03:01.489
THE OTHER FACTOR THAT IS THE IT

07:03:01.556 --> 07:03:03.524
IS THE USUALLY THE SERVICES ARE

07:03:03.591 --> 07:03:05.026
BUNDLED WITH OTHER.

07:03:05.093 --> 07:03:08.162

IN ADDITION TO LAB MONITORING.

07:03:11.666 --> 07:03:14.102
AND I CANNOT IMAGINE A TOPIC

07:03:14.168 --> 07:03:16.337
THAT IS MORE INTIMATE AND

07:03:16.404 --> 07:03:18.539
SENSITIVE DISCUSSION THEN THE

07:03:18.606 --> 07:03:21.075
RISK FACTORS FOR HIV INFECTION

07:03:21.142 --> 07:03:23.077

LARGEST DISPENSERS OF PREP -- IN

07:03:45.700 --> 07:03:47.101

07:04:06.921 --> 07:04:08.156
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE IDEA OF

BLOOD WORK -- YOU PEOPLE COULD

THE PHARMACIST WILL GIVE THEM

07:07:45.206 --> 07:07:47.541
WE NEED TO I THINK THIS NEED TO

07:07:47.608 --> 07:07:49.710
TRUST INDIVIDUALS. TO TAKE

07:07:49.777 --> 07:07:51.879
OWNERSHIP OF THEIR OWN HEALTH

07:07:51.946 --> 07:07:52.513
AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT PRACTICE

07:07:52.580 --> 07:07:54.749
ABOUT -- AND THAT'S WHY WE WORK

07:07:54.815 --> 07:07:56.584
SO HARD TO REMOVE BARRIERS AND

07:07:56.650 --> 07:07:58.452
YOU SAW SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO

07:07:58.519 --> 07:08:02.123
HAVE SPENT THEIR LIFE TRYING TO

07:08:02.189 --> 07:08:03.824
REMOVE BARRIERS TO PRACTICE.

07:08:03.891 --> 07:08:04.925
AND THE UPTAKE IS STILL NOT

07:08:04.992 --> 07:08:06.560
THERE I'M PARTICULARLY AND

07:08:06.627 --> 07:08:08.763
AFRICAN AMERICAN LATINO

07:08:08.829 --> 07:08:09.697
COMMUNITIES.

07:08:09.764 --> 07:08:10.531
IT IS.

07:08:10.598 --> 07:08:13.868
IS HAS SHOCKINGLY LOW AND HIV

07:08:13.934 --> 07:08:16.270
INFECTION RATES ARE HIGHER.

07:08:16.337 --> 07:08:18.272
AND SO WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING

07:08:18.339 --> 07:08:21.142
IN OUR POWER TO EXPAND ACCESS.

07:08:21.208 --> 07:08:22.810

07:08:22.877 --> 07:08:24.945
TO START AND UNFORTUNATELY YOU

07:08:25.012 --> 07:08:25.813
KNOW WHEN I WHEN I WENT ON THE

07:08:25.880 --> 07:08:27.681
PRODUCT AND I PUBLICLY DISCLOSE

07:08:27.748 --> 07:08:29.283
THAT -- ABOUT UNDER FIVE YEARS

07:08:29.350 --> 07:08:31.986
AGO NOW -- I WAS VERY LUCKY I

07:08:32.053 --> 07:08:34.522
WENT TO A POSITION WHO.

07:08:34.588 --> 07:08:36.290
DOES IMMEDIATELY GOT IT DIDN'T

07:08:36.357 --> 07:08:38.459
JUDGE ME THAT AND TRY TO SHAME

07:08:38.526 --> 07:08:40.061

07:08:40.127 --> 07:08:41.429
TO YOU KNOW TELL ME -- JUST BE

07:08:41.495 --> 07:08:45.066
RESPONSIBLE -- AND I WAS LUCKY.

07:08:45.132 --> 07:08:45.699
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE

07:08:45.766 --> 07:08:47.068
THAT EXPERIENCE BECAUSE ALTHOUGH

07:08:47.134 --> 07:08:49.036
MANY POSITIONS ARE VERY GOOD ON

07:08:49.103 --> 07:08:51.238
SEXUAL HEALTH ISSUES WE STILL

07:08:51.305 --> 07:08:52.773
HAVE TOO MANY PHYSICIANS WHO ARE

07:08:52.840 --> 07:08:54.475
NOT COMFORTABLE EVEN TALKING

07:08:54.542 --> 07:08:56.710
ABOUT IT -- AND SO WE'RE TRYING

07:08:56.777 --> 07:08:58.846
TO BALANCE THAT AND TO GIVE

07:08:58.913 --> 07:09:00.347
PEOPLE AS MANY OPTIONS AS

07:09:00.414 --> 07:09:02.583
POSSIBLE PEOPLE CAN STILL CHOOSE

07:09:02.650 --> 07:09:04.418
IN A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL CHOOSE.

07:09:04.485 --> 07:09:05.753
TO GO TO A PHYSICIAN HE SAID I

07:09:05.820 --> 07:09:07.688
WANT TO SEE A POSITION BEFORE I

07:09:07.755 --> 07:09:09.290
DO ANYTHING AND THAT'S GREAT --

07:09:09.356 --> 07:09:10.958
BUT WE WANT TO JUST CREATE MORE

07:09:11.025 --> 07:09:12.726
OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE SO THAT'S

07:09:12.793 --> 07:09:13.494
WHAT IT'S ABOUT.

07:16:33.901 --> 07:16:35.903
MILLION PEOPLE.

07:16:35.969 --> 07:16:36.503
THAT ARE POTENTIALLY INFECTED

07:16:36.570 --> 07:16:39.907

PREVENTING MORBIDITY MORTALITY

07:17:57.851 --> 07:18:00.220
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT OR

07:18:00.287 --> 07:18:02.990
PNEUMOCOCCAL -- INJECTION FOR

07:18:12.432 --> 07:18:16.603
IMPORTANT -- SO -- WITH WE WE

07:18:16.670 --> 07:18:17.738

A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS -- ONE IS

07:19:30.677 --> 07:19:32.546
AN EXCUSE BECAUSE I'D.

SO THERE ARE -- HE KNEW -- TO

07:20:08.982 --> 07:20:11.818
RISKS TO BE MOST AWARE OF ONE IS

07:20:11.885 --> 07:20:13.754
TO MAKE SURE YOUR ONE THE PERSON

07:20:13.820 --> 07:20:15.522

07:20:15.589 --> 07:20:17.591
WHEN THEY GO ON TO PROP --

07:20:17.657 --> 07:20:20.127

NEGATIVE WITHIN SEVEN DAYS

07:20:37.410 --> 07:20:38.645
BEFORE AND THAT'S WHY WE PUT

07:20:38.712 --> 07:20:40.947
THAT REQUIREMENT -- INTO THE

07:20:41.014 --> 07:20:43.083

07:24:55.869 --> 07:24:57.470
THOUGHTFUL -- BUT I ALSO HAVE TO

07:24:57.537 --> 07:24:58.571
AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES THAT

07:24:58.638 --> 07:25:01.674
THIS IS ABOUT ACCESS AND IT'S

07:25:01.741 --> 07:25:03.276
ABOUT ACCESS.

FOR FOLKS IN THE LGBT Q.

07:25:05.278 --> 07:25:07.714
COMMUNITY BUT I ALSO THINK ABOUT

07:25:07.781 --> 07:25:09.249
A WOMAN WHO'S BEEN RAPED.

07:25:09.315 --> 07:25:11.885
AND SHE WHAT WE HAVE FOUND AND I

07:25:11.951 --> 07:25:13.286
THINK MOST OF US KNOW IS MOST

07:25:13.353 --> 07:25:14.721
WOMEN ARE RAPED FEEL THAT IT WAS

07:25:14.788 --> 07:25:15.989
THEIR FAULT AND THEY'RE

07:25:16.056 --> 07:25:17.157
EMBARRASSED AND THEY MAY NOT

07:25:17.223 --> 07:25:18.258
WANT TO GO TO THE DOCTOR.

07:25:18.324 --> 07:25:20.193
SO TO BE ABLE TO GO TO A

07:25:20.260 --> 07:25:24.764
PHARMACIST AND ACCESS PAP --

07:25:24.831 --> 07:25:25.732
WOULD BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL.

07:25:25.799 --> 07:25:26.599
I KNOW OF ONE WOMAN IN MY

07:25:26.666 --> 07:25:28.168
DISTRICT WHO COULDN'T EVEN GET

07:25:28.234 --> 07:25:30.070
PAP THROUGH HER AT THE EMERGENCY

07:25:30.136 --> 07:25:30.904
ROOM.

07:25:30.970 --> 07:25:32.605
AND BY THE TIME SHE WAS FINALLY --

07:25:32.672 --> 07:25:34.040
GIVEN THE PRODUCT IT WAS PASSED

07:25:34.107 --> 07:25:35.608
THE SEVENTY TWO HOURS SO IT WAS

07:25:35.675 --> 07:25:37.043
NOT REALLY EVEN EFFECTIVE FOR

07:25:37.110 --> 07:25:40.480
HER -- AND I THINK THAT.

07:25:40.547 --> 07:25:42.949
IF IF WE IF THERE IS A WAY FOR

07:25:43.016 --> 07:25:44.584
US TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM

07:25:44.651 --> 07:25:47.187
GETTING HIV WHY IN GOD'S NAME

07:25:47.253 --> 07:25:47.921
WOULD WE NOT FIND A WAY TO DO

07:25:47.987 --> 07:25:48.555
THAT.

07:25:48.621 --> 07:25:50.890

MIGHT THEY MIGHT GO TO DIFFERENT

07:25:56.963 --> 07:25:58.465
PHARMACIES AND THEY MIGHT NOT GO

07:25:58.531 --> 07:25:59.632
TO THE DOCTOR.

07:25:59.699 --> 07:26:00.733
IN MY MIND THAT'S A SMALL

07:26:00.800 --> 07:26:02.902
CONCERNED BECAUSE IF THEY'RE

07:26:02.969 --> 07:26:03.770

THEM FROM GETTING SICK AND

07:26:07.207 --> 07:26:08.374
POSSIBLY DYING.

07:26:08.441 --> 07:26:09.943

07:29:42.522 --> 07:29:45.191
AND SO MY CONCERN IS IN TERMS OF

07:29:45.258 --> 07:29:47.226
CLOSING THE LOOP IS IS THAT OKAY

07:29:47.293 --> 07:29:48.661
YOU HAVE SOMEONE COME IN TO GET

07:29:48.728 --> 07:29:49.962
THE PRESCRIPTION PHARMACISTS

07:29:50.029 --> 07:29:51.297
ORDER A TEST RIGHT.

07:29:51.364 --> 07:29:52.732
THE TEST COMES BACK AND THERE'S

07:29:52.799 --> 07:29:54.600
AN ABNORMALITY ON THE TEST AND

07:29:54.667 --> 07:29:56.002
THE PHARMACIST MAYOR MAY NOT

07:29:56.069 --> 07:29:57.003
PICK UP ON IT IF THEY'RE JUST

07:29:57.070 --> 07:29:58.204
LOOKING AT THE CREATININE AND

07:29:58.271 --> 07:30:00.006
THEY'RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO

07:30:00.073 --> 07:30:01.808
THE BY CAR LEVEL OR TO POTASSIUM

07:30:01.874 --> 07:30:04.410
OR SODIUM -- THEN WHAT HAPPENS

07:30:04.477 --> 07:30:05.578
IS THAT SO THAT'S NOW EITHER NOT

07:30:05.645 --> 07:30:07.480
PAID ATTENTION TO OR NOT

07:30:07.547 --> 07:30:09.682
UNDERSTOOD AS BEING PROBLEMATIC

07:30:09.749 --> 07:30:11.250
SO THIS ISN'T AND AND I

07:30:11.317 --> 07:30:12.652
APPRECIATE THAT WHAT YOUR FOCUS

07:30:12.719 --> 07:30:14.087
ON HIV IN THAT SORT OF PRIMARY

07:30:14.153 --> 07:30:15.221
THING BUT THERE COULD BE OTHER

07:30:15.288 --> 07:30:16.489
CONDITIONS.

07:30:16.556 --> 07:30:19.192
RIGHT THAT MAY HAVE THAT THAT

07:30:19.258 --> 07:30:19.826
THAT THERE MAY BE WARNING SIGNS

07:30:19.892 --> 07:30:20.226
ABOUT.

07:30:20.293 --> 07:30:22.028
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT NO

07:30:22.095 --> 07:30:23.396
ONE PAYS ATTENTION TO IT AND

07:30:23.463 --> 07:30:25.031
THEN FINALLY THE PATIENT COMES

07:30:25.098 --> 07:30:26.733
AND SAYS -- SOMETHING HAPPENS

07:30:26.799 --> 07:30:27.533
AND THEY'RE LIKE WELL GEE DOES A

07:30:27.600 --> 07:30:29.135
TEST DONE BEFORE NO ONE PICKED

07:30:29.202 --> 07:30:30.770
UP ON IT KNOWN COMMUNICATED TO

07:30:30.837 --> 07:30:32.238
ME DOORS AN ABNORMALITY.

07:30:32.305 --> 07:30:34.340
AND TO ME YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT

07:30:34.407 --> 07:30:36.809
TEAM BASED CARE -- YEAH I THINK

07:30:36.876 --> 07:30:38.010
THE END THIS IS A PLACE FOR THE

07:30:38.077 --> 07:30:39.545
PHARMACIST SHOULD HAVE A PRIMARY

07:30:39.612 --> 07:30:40.813
ROLE BUT THERE SHOULD BE A BACK

07:30:40.880 --> 07:30:42.281
UP THERE SHOULD BE A PHYSICIAN

07:30:42.348 --> 07:30:44.317
TEAM PLAYER WHO IS.

07:30:44.384 --> 07:30:46.853
AVAILABLE TO REVIEW THESE TESTS

07:30:46.919 --> 07:30:48.454
TO ALSO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE

07:30:48.521 --> 07:30:49.255
PHARMACIST MIGHT HAVE BECAUSE

07:30:49.322 --> 07:30:50.256
THESE AREN'T EVEN ADVANCED

07:30:50.323 --> 07:30:51.624
PRACTICE PHARMACISTS WERE

07:30:51.691 --> 07:30:53.192
TALKING ABOUT THESE ARE GONNA BE

07:30:53.259 --> 07:30:54.994
FRONTLINE PHARMACISTS TO YOU

07:30:55.061 --> 07:30:55.628
KNOW DO YOU HAVE TO DO A LITTLE

07:30:55.695 --> 07:30:56.262
AYE STRAINING.

07:30:56.329 --> 07:30:57.697
AS  MATTER AS THE PHARMACY

07:30:57.764 --> 07:30:59.665
BOARD IS REQUIRED BUT THEY DON'T

07:30:59.732 --> 07:31:01.134
YOU KNOW THAT I THINK THAT WE

07:31:01.200 --> 07:31:02.535
NEED TO THINK MORE ABOUT THESE

07:31:02.602 --> 07:31:04.203
TEAMS NOW I KNOW THAT THE THE

07:31:04.270 --> 07:31:05.204
PROPONENTS ARE GONNA SAY WELL

07:31:05.271 --> 07:31:06.739
IT'S HARD TO GET A COLLABORATIVE

07:31:06.806 --> 07:31:07.807
PRACTICE AGREEMENT NIGHT.

07:31:07.874 --> 07:31:09.675
FIRST OF ALL I'M NOT SUGGESTING

07:31:09.742 --> 07:31:11.177
THAT WE EVEN SAY THAT A

07:31:11.244 --> 07:31:12.445
PHYSICIAN CAN ONLY HAVE A CLASS

07:31:12.512 --> 07:31:13.713
PRACTICE AGREEMENT ONLY ONE

07:31:13.780 --> 07:31:15.381
PHARMACISTS AND IN FACT YOU HAVE

07:31:15.448 --> 07:31:16.849
POSITIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL

07:31:16.916 --> 07:31:17.517
AND I SAID WELL.

07:31:17.583 --> 07:31:20.253
DO YOU WANT TO HAVE A CLEVER

07:31:20.319 --> 07:31:20.887
PRACTICE AGREEMENT WITH THE AN

07:31:20.953 --> 07:31:22.155
OFF TWENTY THIRTY FORTY

07:31:22.221 --> 07:31:23.656
PHARMACIES WHO ARE DOING THIS

07:31:23.723 --> 07:31:25.925
AND THE AND IT BE AVAILABLE AS

07:31:25.992 --> 07:31:27.226
THAT BACK UP PERSON TO THAT

07:31:27.293 --> 07:31:28.795
COUNCIL PERSON TODAY WOULD HAVE

07:31:28.861 --> 07:31:30.396
AN EXISTING RELATIONSHIP WITH.

07:31:30.463 --> 07:31:31.631
I DON'T YOU KNOW I'M NOT LOOKING

07:31:31.697 --> 07:31:33.466
FOR LIKE THIS WHOLE BIG BLOWN

07:31:33.533 --> 07:31:35.501
THING BUT THAT -- THAT'S GONNA

07:31:35.568 --> 07:31:37.303
BE OVERLY BURDENSOME BUT I DO

07:31:37.370 --> 07:31:39.639
THINK WE DO NEED TO HAVE THAT.

07:31:39.705 --> 07:31:40.840
THAT RELATIONSHIP AND THAT BACK

07:31:40.907 --> 07:31:42.475
UP AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING WHERE

07:31:42.542 --> 07:31:43.876
PHARMACISTS AS WELL I'M NOT SURE

07:31:43.943 --> 07:31:45.211
THIS IS RIGHT NOW I GOT A CALL

07:31:45.278 --> 07:31:47.046
AROUND A BUNCH OF DOCTORS A FIND

07:31:47.113 --> 07:31:47.713
OF SOMEONE WILL HELP ME IT'S TO

07:31:47.780 --> 07:31:50.049
BE A PRE EXISTING RELATIONSHIP.

07:31:50.116 --> 07:31:51.417
SOME HOPING THAT WE CAN TRY I

07:31:51.484 --> 07:31:53.052
MEAN THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO SEE

07:31:53.119 --> 07:31:54.754
WE GET TO SOME PLACE LIKE THAT

07:31:54.821 --> 07:31:57.390
WHERE WHERE WE WERE THERE'S A

07:31:57.457 --> 07:31:59.158
TEAM THAT CAN WORK TOGETHER TO

07:31:59.225 --> 07:32:00.793
BE SURE WE HAVE ALL THE BASES

07:32:00.860 --> 07:32:01.294
COVERED.

07:32:01.360 --> 07:32:03.062
BECAUSE I DO ONE AND I I'VE BEEN

07:32:03.129 --> 07:32:04.597
FULLY SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT

07:32:04.664 --> 07:32:05.832
SOMEONE COMES TO THE PHARMACIST

07:32:05.898 --> 07:32:07.834
AND THEY GET THE MEDICATION THEY

07:32:07.900 --> 07:32:08.801
GET THE PATH TO GET TO PRESS

07:32:08.868 --> 07:32:10.369
RIGHT -- I KNOW THE CMA'S ALSO

07:32:10.436 --> 07:32:11.604
EXCITED ABOUT THE PREP SIDE OF

07:32:11.671 --> 07:32:13.372
THINGS I'M FINE WITH THAT BUT I

07:32:13.439 --> 07:32:15.441
DO FEEL THAT BECAUSE OF THESE

07:32:15.508 --> 07:32:16.742
ISSUES AND THIS IS.

07:32:16.809 --> 07:32:24.584
WHAT'S RECOGNIZE CC THAT WE HAVE

07:32:24.650 --> 07:32:25.218
TO HAVE SOME KIND OF CLOSING OF

07:32:25.284 --> 07:32:26.419
THE LOOP.

07:32:26.486 --> 07:32:27.320
OTHERWISE I'M AFRAID THAT WHILE

07:32:27.386 --> 07:32:28.187
THERE'S OPPORTUNITY

07:32:28.254 --> 07:32:29.422
UNFORTUNATELY FOR A PATIENT --

07:32:29.489 --> 07:32:30.456
TO TO HAVE SOMETHING YOU KNOW

07:32:30.523 --> 07:32:31.724
NOT SO POSITIVE HAPPEN IN THE

07:32:31.791 --> 07:32:32.492
NOT THE SO BE ABOUT THEIR HIV

07:32:32.558 --> 07:32:33.326
STATUS COULD BE ABOUT SOMETHING

07:32:33.392 --> 07:32:34.193
ELSE.

07:32:34.260 --> 07:32:34.961
AND SET AND SO I'M YOU KNOW I'M

07:32:35.027 --> 07:32:36.095
I LOOK AT THE BIGGER PICTURE

07:32:36.162 --> 07:32:37.663
ABOUT THEIR OVERALL HEALTH

07:32:37.730 --> 07:32:38.965
BECAUSE I MEAN THIS IS.

07:32:39.031 --> 07:32:40.833
BECOMING IN FOR THIS BUT AT SOME

07:32:40.900 --> 07:32:42.268
POINT AND THE PHARMACIST CAN

07:32:42.335 --> 07:32:43.803
CERTAINLY DO A LOT OF WORK WITH

07:32:43.870 --> 07:32:45.071
THE KNIVES AND NOT DOWN.

07:32:45.137 --> 07:32:46.539
BUT IT IS ABOUT BEING SURE THAT

07:32:46.606 --> 07:32:48.107
WE GET ALL OUR BASES COVERED AND

07:32:48.174 --> 07:32:50.576
SO THAT THAT THAT IS A CONCERN I

07:32:50.643 --> 07:32:51.878
SUBMIT THAT I HAVE AND I

07:32:51.944 --> 07:32:53.179
APPRECIATE BY WAY OF HAVE TO

07:32:53.246 --> 07:32:53.713
MENTION THAT.

07:32:53.779 --> 07:32:55.181
I KNOW WE'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN

07:32:55.248 --> 07:32:56.816
DIALOGUING BACK AND FORTH AND WE

07:32:56.883 --> 07:32:58.317
KIND OF INCHING CLOSER TOGETHER

07:32:58.384 --> 07:32:59.619
WE HAVEN'T QUITE CLOSE THE GAP

07:32:59.685 --> 07:33:02.021
YET THERE -- BUT AND I REALIZE

07:33:02.088 --> 07:33:03.623
THAT YOU KNOW YOUR CONCERN IS

07:33:03.689 --> 07:33:04.724
THAT CLAD PRACTICE ROOM ISN'T

07:33:04.790 --> 07:33:06.425
THAT TOO MUCH OF A BARRIER I I

07:33:06.492 --> 07:33:07.326
ACTUALLY.

07:33:07.393 --> 07:33:09.195
THINK THAT WE CAN THAT THAT

07:33:09.262 --> 07:33:11.831
THAT'S NOT TOO MUCH OF A BARRIER --

07:33:11.898 --> 07:33:13.299
AND THAT IF YOU KNOW WE IF WE

07:33:13.366 --> 07:33:14.300
CAN'T BUT IF WE CAN'T GET A

07:33:14.367 --> 07:33:16.435
POSITION TO STEP UP AND SAY I'M

07:33:16.502 --> 07:33:18.471
WILLING TO DO THIS AND IT'S

07:33:18.538 --> 07:33:20.339
BECAUSE IT'S TOO RISKY OR THE

07:33:20.406 --> 07:33:21.173
LIABILITIES TOO HIGH.

07:33:21.240 --> 07:33:25.778
THEN WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR THE

07:33:25.845 --> 07:33:27.313
PHARMACIST.

07:33:27.380 --> 07:33:28.147
IF THEY DON'T HAVE THAT BACK UP

07:33:28.214 --> 07:33:29.315
WITH AS A PHARMACIST ONLY

07:33:29.382 --> 07:33:29.916
RESPONSE WILL DO IN ORDER TO

07:33:29.982 --> 07:33:31.150
TEST THEIR THE ONE RESPONSIBLE

07:33:31.217 --> 07:33:32.885
FOR THE RESULTS.

07:33:32.952 --> 07:33:34.387
SO I JUST I JUST WANT TO MAKE

07:33:34.453 --> 07:33:34.921
THAT SO.

07:33:34.987 --> 07:33:35.955
ANYWAY.

07:33:36.022 --> 07:33:37.390
SELECT FREE AND I KNOW THERE'S

07:33:37.456 --> 07:33:38.257
SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN MIND BUT

07:33:38.324 --> 07:33:40.393
NO I I I I APPRECIATE THAT --

07:33:40.459 --> 07:33:42.261
MISTER CHAIRMAN AND AND I KNOW

07:33:42.328 --> 07:33:44.463
YOU -- YOU KNOW -- A AND YOU

07:33:44.530 --> 07:33:45.197
KNOW THAT I HAVE ENORMOUS

07:33:45.264 --> 07:33:47.066
RESPECT FOR YOU AS A HEALTHCARE

07:33:47.133 --> 07:33:49.468
PROFESSIONALS AND YOUR YOUR

07:33:49.535 --> 07:33:52.104
AGREE ON MANY MANY MANY ISSUES

07:33:52.171 --> 07:33:53.706
AND YOU AND I RARELY DISAGREE --

07:33:53.773 --> 07:33:56.208
BUT ON THE SPECIFIC ISSUE AYE

07:33:56.275 --> 07:33:58.744
AYE WE DID GIVE A REAL

07:33:58.811 --> 07:34:01.180
CONSIDERATION LOOKED AT AT AND

07:34:01.247 --> 07:34:03.649
WE AND I AND AS I COMMUNICATED

07:34:03.716 --> 07:34:05.484
TO AYE ON PORTS I CAN'T ACCEPT --

07:34:05.551 --> 07:34:08.187
THAT AMENDMENT -- BECAUSE

07:34:08.254 --> 07:34:09.822
REQUIRING TO BASICALLY WHAT THAT

07:34:09.889 --> 07:34:12.024
MAN WOULD DO IS TO SAY OKAY THE

07:34:12.091 --> 07:34:13.926
ONLY PHARMACISTS THAT CAN

07:34:13.993 --> 07:34:16.762
PROVIDE -- PROPER PAP ARE

07:34:16.829 --> 07:34:18.230
PHARMACISTS WHO HAVE A

07:34:18.297 --> 07:34:19.665
COLLABORATIVE PRACTICE AGREEMENT

07:34:19.732 --> 07:34:21.033
WITH POSITIONS.

07:34:21.100 --> 07:34:24.804
AND WHAT THAT AS WELL CALL CPA --

07:34:24.870 --> 07:34:28.140
FOR SURE -- A CPA IS A FORMAL

07:34:28.207 --> 07:34:30.943
FORMAL LEGAL ARRANGEMENT -- THAT

07:34:31.010 --> 07:34:32.612
WE TOOK WHEN THE ONE PHARMACIST

07:34:32.678 --> 07:34:34.914
WERE AUTHORIZED -- TO PROVIDE

07:34:34.981 --> 07:34:37.283
VACCINES IN THE NINETIES FIVE OF

07:34:37.350 --> 07:34:38.718
A COLLABORATIVE PRACTICE

07:34:38.784 --> 07:34:39.986
AGREEMENT WAS REQUIRED.

07:34:40.052 --> 07:34:42.388
AND THAT WAS REPEALED THE

07:34:42.455 --> 07:34:42.922
LEGISLATURE REPEALED THAT

07:34:42.989 --> 07:34:45.825
REQUIREMENT BECAUSE IT WAS -- TO

07:34:45.891 --> 07:34:46.993
ONEROUS AND THERE WERE NOT

07:34:47.059 --> 07:34:48.494
ENOUGH PHARMACISTS WHO WERE

07:34:48.561 --> 07:34:50.863
WILLING TO DO IT SO FOR AND AND

07:34:50.930 --> 07:34:52.231
I'VE ALSO BEEN TOLD THAT THERE

07:34:52.298 --> 07:34:54.100
ARE AREN'T A LOT OF DOCTORS.

07:34:54.166 --> 07:34:55.568
WHO WANT TO DO IT BECAUSE THEN?

07:34:55.635 --> 07:34:57.637
THE DOCTORS HAVING TO WORK

07:34:57.703 --> 07:34:59.138
THROUGH SOMEONE ELSE.

07:34:59.205 --> 07:35:00.606
TOWARDS THE PATIENT.

07:35:00.673 --> 07:35:01.807
AND SO YOU YOU'RE GOING TO END

07:35:01.874 --> 07:35:04.377
UP WITH VERY FEW PHARMACIES THAT

07:35:04.443 --> 07:35:07.613
PARTICIPATE I'M AFRAID -- AND IT

07:35:07.680 --> 07:35:09.882
WILL NOT AND AND THAT'S WHY I

07:35:09.949 --> 07:35:11.250
BELIEVE IT WOULD REALLY

07:35:11.317 --> 07:35:13.419
DRAMATICALLY UNDERMINE -- THE

07:35:13.486 --> 07:35:14.820
BILL AND THAT'S AND FOR THAT

07:35:14.887 --> 07:35:17.657
REASON I WASN'T ABLE -- TO TO

07:35:17.723 --> 07:35:18.858
ACCEPT THAT OKAY WELL I

07:35:18.924 --> 07:35:20.026
APPRECIATE THAT I THINK YOU KNOW

07:35:20.092 --> 07:35:21.427
WHAT I'M REALLY LOOKING AT

07:35:21.494 --> 07:35:23.396
BECAUSE AND UNLIKE.

07:35:23.462 --> 07:35:25.998
GIVING OF VACCINATION -- AND WE

07:35:26.065 --> 07:35:26.565
TALKED A LOT OF ACCIDENTS A

07:35:26.632 --> 07:35:36.709
READY -- THIS IS A THIS REQUIRES

07:35:36.776 --> 07:35:37.576
IT'S NOT ONLY DISPENSING THE

07:35:37.643 --> 07:35:39.045
MEDICATION -- IT'S ALSO WEARING

07:35:39.111 --> 07:35:40.980
LAP THAT LAB TESTS AND ACTUALLY

07:35:41.047 --> 07:35:42.248
NOT IN THIS.

07:35:42.314 --> 07:35:43.282
THE NOT NECESSARILY LAB TESTS

07:35:43.349 --> 07:35:44.316
THAT MAYBE THAT EASILY

07:35:44.383 --> 07:35:46.218
INTERPRETED AS SOMEONE WHO HAS A

07:35:46.285 --> 07:35:46.852
POSITION AS TO GET SO YOU ONE

07:35:46.919 --> 07:35:47.620
COULD ARGUE THAT THEY SAID WELL

07:35:47.687 --> 07:35:49.055
ALL YOU REALLY NEED TO DO IS GET

07:35:49.121 --> 07:35:50.322
TO CREATE NAME BUT FLOW AT SAM'S

07:35:50.389 --> 07:35:51.857
THE ORDER ENTRY AND YOU KNOW BE

07:35:51.924 --> 07:35:52.191
ON TRAINING.

07:35:52.258 --> 07:35:53.025
IN THE GUINEA TENSED CAM SEVEN

07:35:53.092 --> 07:35:53.592
NOW YOU HAVE A SET A LAPSE

07:35:53.659 --> 07:35:54.894
RESULTS THAT HAVE TO GET

07:35:54.960 --> 07:35:59.165
INTERPRETED IN.

07:35:59.231 --> 07:36:01.901
I THINK THAT -- IT AND DECIDE

07:36:01.967 --> 07:36:02.468
WHAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE

07:36:02.535 --> 07:36:03.102
WHOLE PATIENTS AND SO I THINK

07:36:03.169 --> 07:36:05.004
THAT THAT I I DO HAVE CONCERNS

07:36:05.071 --> 07:36:06.706
THAT WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WE'RE

07:36:06.772 --> 07:36:08.507
NOT REALLY CLOSING THE LOOP AND

07:36:08.574 --> 07:36:09.241
IS THAT I'M.

07:36:09.308 --> 07:36:11.010
WILLING TO LOOK AT AND I KNOW

07:36:11.077 --> 07:36:12.411
THAT YOU'D AGAIN I WANT TO

07:36:12.478 --> 07:36:13.879
RECOGNIZE THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING

07:36:13.946 --> 07:36:15.081
SOME BACK FORTH YOU KNOW.

07:36:15.147 --> 07:36:16.348
THE NATURE OF THE AGREEMENT IN

07:36:16.415 --> 07:36:18.284
THIS IS YOU CAN BE CONSTRUCTED

07:36:18.350 --> 07:36:21.887
IN A WAY THAT -- THAT ACTUALLY --

07:36:21.954 --> 07:36:25.224
FACILITATES -- THIS HAPPENING

07:36:25.291 --> 07:36:26.759
WHICH DOESN'T CUT OUT HUGE

07:36:26.826 --> 07:36:29.895
BURDEN ON THE PHYSICIANS AND AS

07:36:29.962 --> 07:36:30.496
WELL AS ON THE PHARMACISTS AND

07:36:30.563 --> 07:36:32.064
SO.

07:36:32.131 --> 07:36:34.266
SO -- AND THEY DID IT SO ANYWAY

07:36:34.333 --> 07:36:35.701
I I THINK THAT BUT HAVING SOME

07:36:35.768 --> 07:36:37.136
PRE EXISTING RELATIONSHIP NOT

07:36:37.203 --> 07:36:38.337
JUST SIMPLY A LIST OF PHYSICIANS

07:36:38.404 --> 07:36:39.505
WHO DON'T HAVE A RELATIONSHIP

07:36:39.572 --> 07:36:40.940
WITH THE PHARMACIST I MEAN I

07:36:41.006 --> 07:36:41.574
THINK THERE HAS TO BE RELATION

07:36:41.640 --> 07:36:43.008
BETWEEN PHARMACISTS AND DOCTORS

07:36:43.075 --> 07:36:44.310
SOMEWAY HOUSE.

07:36:44.376 --> 07:36:46.011
HOWEVER WE WANT TO MANAGE THAT

07:36:46.078 --> 07:36:47.813
BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME

07:36:47.880 --> 07:36:49.014
EXPECTATION -- STATE

07:36:49.081 --> 07:36:50.850
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO SO

07:36:50.916 --> 07:36:53.319
THAT THE POSITION ISN'T BY FROM

07:36:53.385 --> 07:36:54.286
THE PHARMACIST CALLS TO YOU LIKE

07:36:54.353 --> 07:36:56.055
BUT WHAT WHEN EIGHT WHERE YOU

07:36:56.122 --> 07:36:56.388
CALLING ME.

07:36:56.455 --> 07:36:57.289
RIGHT I DON'T KNOW I KNOW YOU'RE

07:36:57.356 --> 07:36:58.124
CALLING NEEDS AND FOR WHAT

07:36:58.190 --> 07:36:59.558
PARTICULAR REASONS BECAUSE I

07:36:59.625 --> 07:37:01.260
KNOW WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE AGREED IN

07:37:01.327 --> 07:37:08.367
SOME WAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO

07:37:08.434 --> 07:37:10.436
HAVE THIS KIND OF RELATIONSHIP.

07:37:10.503 --> 07:37:11.270
DOCTOR GRAHAM WHO.

07:37:11.337 --> 07:37:12.037
MAY BE ABLE TO COMMENT ON THAT

07:37:12.104 --> 07:37:13.639
AS WELL.

07:37:13.706 --> 07:37:15.174
YEAH THE THE CBC CALLS -- FOR

07:37:15.241 --> 07:37:15.708
CREATE IN TESTING AND THE

07:37:15.775 --> 07:37:16.175
INTERPRETATION OF THAT

07:37:16.242 --> 07:37:17.543
PARTICULAR TEST ACCORDING TO CDC

07:37:17.610 --> 07:37:18.878
GUIDANCE IS VERY.

07:37:18.944 --> 07:37:21.113
SIMPLE IT'S EITHER -- ESTIMATED

07:37:21.180 --> 07:37:22.148
CRANDON CLEARANCE OF GREATER

07:37:22.214 --> 07:37:24.150
THAN SIXTY ARE LESS THAN SIXTY I

07:37:24.216 --> 07:37:25.050
DON'T THINK WE SHOULD.

07:37:25.117 --> 07:37:29.021
BE -- PRETENDING ARE CLAIMING OR

07:37:29.088 --> 07:37:30.022
ASKING PEOPLE TO BELIEVE THAT

07:37:30.089 --> 07:37:31.357
IT'S MORE COMPLICATED THAN IT

07:37:31.423 --> 07:37:32.892
REALLY IS I WOULD ALSO WANT TO

07:37:32.958 --> 07:37:34.460
HIGHLIGHT THAT THESE -- THIS

07:37:34.527 --> 07:37:35.861
BILL IS ENTIRELY CONSISTENT WITH

07:37:35.928 --> 07:37:37.530
CDC GUIDANCE REGARDING HOW TO

07:37:37.596 --> 07:37:39.064
PROVIDE PROP -- THEY

07:37:39.131 --> 07:37:40.699
SPECIFICALLY DID NOT REQUIRE

07:37:40.766 --> 07:37:42.134
THAT A PHYSICIAN BE INVOLVED

07:37:42.201 --> 07:37:44.904
BECAUSE IT'S REALLY. TOO EASY

07:37:44.970 --> 07:37:47.306
FOR PHYSICIANS -- ITS IT'S

07:37:47.373 --> 07:37:49.275
ALGORITHMIC CARE OF LIKE MOUNT

07:37:49.341 --> 07:37:50.676
MOST OF OUR PREVENTIVE CARE

07:37:50.743 --> 07:37:52.845
STRATEGIESAND SO WE AND AND YOU

07:37:52.912 --> 07:37:54.180
KNOW PHYSICIANS ARE NOT GOING TO

07:37:54.246 --> 07:37:55.714
BE INTERESTED IN ESTABLISHING.

07:37:55.781 --> 07:37:57.316
A COLLABORATIVE PRACTICE SCREAMS

07:37:57.383 --> 07:38:00.252
BECAUSE THERE REALLY ISN'T -- AN

07:38:00.319 --> 07:38:01.420
OF WORK FOR THEM TO DO THEY'RE

07:38:01.487 --> 07:38:02.788
NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO JUSTIFY

07:38:02.855 --> 07:38:04.824
THEIR EFFORT AND TIME -- IN

07:38:04.890 --> 07:38:06.692
THOSE AGREEMENTS AND LEGALLY

07:38:06.759 --> 07:38:10.596
THEY'RE JUST TAKING A LONG TIME

07:38:10.663 --> 07:38:12.565
TO ESTABLISH.

07:38:12.631 --> 07:38:13.098
I SHOULD PERHAPS THE OTHER

07:38:13.165 --> 07:38:14.099
POSITION I MEAN WHEN DO YOU GET

07:38:14.166 --> 07:38:16.402
A LAB TEST YOU SIMPLY SAY -- I

07:38:16.468 --> 07:38:18.237
HI THAT'S NOT WHAT I DO BUT I'M

07:38:18.304 --> 07:38:20.472
JUST -- I GET A LAB TEST AND I

07:38:20.539 --> 07:38:21.974
TALKED TO THE PATIENT UNDERSTAND

07:38:22.041 --> 07:38:23.642
WHY THEY WANT THE MEDICATION AND

07:38:23.709 --> 07:38:24.977
WHY THEY'RE NOT AND IT'S JUST

07:38:25.044 --> 07:38:26.779
FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MAYBE NOT

07:38:26.846 --> 07:38:28.080
PRACTICING THIS EVERY DAY.

07:38:28.147 --> 07:38:30.416
POST EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS IS AN

07:38:30.482 --> 07:38:32.651
URGENT SITUATION PRE EXPOSURE

07:38:32.718 --> 07:38:35.354
PROPHYLAXIS IS THE LONG TERM

07:38:35.421 --> 07:38:37.389
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PHYSICIAN

07:38:37.456 --> 07:38:38.691
TO DECREASE THAT PERSON'S RISK

07:38:38.757 --> 07:38:40.226
OF ACQUIRING.

07:38:40.292 --> 07:38:42.161
HIV INFECTION AND IT'S AN

07:38:42.228 --> 07:38:43.762
OPPORTUNITY THESE PEOPLE CAME

07:38:43.829 --> 07:38:45.664
BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE RISK

07:38:45.731 --> 07:38:48.000
FACTORS THEY WANTED TO REVEAL IT

07:38:48.067 --> 07:38:50.069
TO PHYSICIAN SEEK HELP FOR IT.

07:38:50.135 --> 07:38:52.037
IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT

07:38:52.104 --> 07:38:54.240
OTHER RISKS OF OTHER INFECTIONS

07:38:54.306 --> 07:38:55.341
OTHER.

07:38:55.407 --> 07:38:57.076
HEALTH ADVERSE CONDITIONS AT THE

07:38:57.142 --> 07:38:59.311
ODD AT AND DISCOVER IT AND

07:38:59.378 --> 07:39:00.479
ADDRESS IT.

07:39:00.546 --> 07:39:02.314
AND IS THAT IT'S A IT'S A TAKE

07:39:02.381 --> 07:39:05.184
SOME TIME FOR PEOPLE TO ACT TO

07:39:05.251 --> 07:39:06.485
AGREE TO COME TO THE DOCTOR WITH

07:39:06.552 --> 07:39:08.754
THIS CONCERN TO ACCEPT TREATMENT.

07:39:08.821 --> 07:39:10.155
I IT I DO NOT KNOW IF IT'S GONNA

07:39:10.222 --> 07:39:14.159
BE EASIER FOR THEM TO REVIEW

07:39:14.226 --> 07:39:14.994
SUCH INTIMATE.

07:39:15.060 --> 07:39:16.295
DETAILS OF THEIR LIFE TO A

07:39:16.362 --> 07:39:17.696
PHARMACIST RETAIL PHARMACY

07:39:17.763 --> 07:39:19.598
SITUATION SO WE TALK ABOUT

07:39:19.665 --> 07:39:21.934
OTHERS FACTOR FOR FOR STDS DRUG

07:39:22.001 --> 07:39:24.737
ABUSE PROBLEMS THIS THING SET UP

07:39:24.803 --> 07:39:25.771
WITH THE METRIC OKAY ED PREACHY

07:39:25.838 --> 07:39:28.741
TED BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT.

07:39:28.807 --> 07:39:30.776
THE BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST LOOKING

07:39:30.843 --> 07:39:31.944
VERY NARROWLY ABOUT THIS ONE

07:39:32.011 --> 07:39:33.012
THING AND I'M TO THE PROBLEMS

07:39:33.078 --> 07:39:33.646
THAT YOU HAVE A TEST RESULT YOU

07:39:33.712 --> 07:39:34.580
LOOK MORE BROADLY BECAUSE YOU

07:39:34.647 --> 07:39:35.848
CAN'T JUST SIMPLY SAY WELL.

07:39:35.915 --> 07:39:36.949
I'D ONLY LOOKED AT THIS ONE

07:39:37.016 --> 07:39:38.684
ASPECT AND SOMETHING ELSE IS

07:39:38.751 --> 07:39:39.785
ABNORMAL AND THEREFORE SO I

07:39:39.852 --> 07:39:41.153
DON'T PAY ATTENTION BECAUSE THIS

07:39:41.220 --> 07:39:45.157
IS ONLY FOR TESTING FOR PRESS.

07:39:45.224 --> 07:39:45.791
RIGHT.

07:39:45.858 --> 07:39:46.859
AND TIMES WHEN THE POTASSIUM IS

07:39:46.926 --> 07:39:48.027
IT'LL BE LOW OR THE BY COVERAGE

07:39:48.093 --> 07:39:49.128
EIGHT REPEATED AGAIN TO MAKE

07:39:49.194 --> 07:39:50.529
SURE OF IT TRANSIT OF REGRET

07:39:50.596 --> 07:39:51.030
OKAY.

07:39:51.096 --> 07:39:52.598
CENTER STONE DR GRANT.

07:39:52.665 --> 07:39:54.967
SO -- IF IF THE PATIENT -- GETS

07:39:55.034 --> 07:39:56.502
ON ON PROP.

07:39:56.568 --> 07:39:59.305

07:40:02.374 --> 07:40:03.943
SOME.

07:40:04.009 --> 07:40:04.543
GOOD POINTS THAT YOU KNOW YOU

07:40:04.610 --> 07:40:05.811
JUST CAN'T LOOK AT CREE AND THEN

07:40:05.878 --> 07:40:06.412
YOU CAN JUST LOOK ABILITY --

07:40:06.478 --> 07:40:07.446
NITROGEN YOU GOT A LOOK AT SOME

07:40:07.513 --> 07:40:08.113
OTHER THINGS AS WELL AND WE EAT

07:40:08.180 --> 07:40:09.048
AND USUALLY WHEN YOU GET THESE

07:40:09.114 --> 07:40:10.416
TESTS BACK USUALLY SEE THEM

07:40:10.482 --> 07:40:12.084
HIGHLIGHTED IF THERE'S SOMETHING

07:40:12.151 --> 07:40:14.586
ABNORMAL USUALLY.

07:40:14.653 --> 07:40:15.020
RIGHT AWAY.

07:40:15.087 --> 07:40:16.188
BUT WITHIN THAT THIRTY DAY

07:40:16.255 --> 07:40:17.156
PERIOD.

07:40:17.222 --> 07:40:18.657
IF SOMEBODY WAS HAVING REAL

07:40:18.724 --> 07:40:20.726
DIFFICULTIES.

07:40:20.793 --> 07:40:22.194

IN YOUR IN YOUR VIEWPOINT.

07:40:27.533 --> 07:40:30.369
WELL THE THE RENAL INSUFFICIENCY

07:40:30.436 --> 07:40:31.570
WOULD START OFF IN IN A

07:40:31.637 --> 07:40:33.172
SYMPTOMATIC PHASE.

07:40:33.238 --> 07:40:34.773
IT WITH -- TEN OFF OF YOUR WE

07:40:34.840 --> 07:40:36.275
HAVEN'T SEEN RENAL FAILURE WE'VE

07:40:36.342 --> 07:40:37.743
SEEN ABNORMALITIES IN SERUM

07:40:37.810 --> 07:40:38.911
CREATININE.

07:40:38.978 --> 07:40:41.513
A TYPICALLY THEY OCCUR THREE TO

07:40:41.580 --> 07:40:42.081
FOUR MONTHS AFTER PREP IS

07:40:42.147 --> 07:40:43.382
STARTED.

07:40:43.449 --> 07:40:44.850
IT'S NOT N THE FIRST MONTH SO --

07:40:44.917 --> 07:40:46.518
AND SO THE PERSON WOULD HAVE

07:40:46.585 --> 07:40:48.387
TRANSFERRED THEIR CARE -- TO A

07:40:48.454 --> 07:40:50.322
POSITION BY THAT TIME ACCORDING

07:40:50.389 --> 07:40:52.224
TO THIS BILL OR THEY WOULD HAVE

07:40:52.291 --> 07:40:53.659
STOPPED BRIGHT BECAUSE WHEN I'M

07:40:53.726 --> 07:40:54.293
TRYING TO MAKE IS NOT GONNA GO

07:40:54.360 --> 07:40:55.494
INTO RENAL FAILURE WITHIN THE

07:40:55.561 --> 07:40:56.996
FIRST THIRTY DAYS OF TREATMENT --

07:40:57.062 --> 07:40:58.530
BASED ON THE LITERATURE THAT YOU

ARTICULATED EARLIER THAT YOU

07:41:01.133 --> 07:41:01.700
HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT

07:41:01.767 --> 07:41:03.369
NEVER SEEN RENAL FAILURE AND IN

07:41:03.435 --> 07:41:05.170
THE SETTING OF HIV TREATMENT WE

07:41:05.237 --> 07:41:06.505
CAN SEE BEING A FAILURE AND

07:41:06.572 --> 07:41:07.973
TYPICALLY CARS THREE OR FOUR

07:41:08.040 --> 07:41:09.441
MONTHS INTO THERAPY.

THAT ACCOUNTS.

07:41:25.624 --> 07:41:28.127
FOR MORE POISON CONTROL CENTERS

07:41:28.193 --> 07:41:31.663
GETTING CALLS THAN ANY OTHER.

07:41:31.730 --> 07:41:32.865

ASKING CMA OF THAT IF THAT IS AN

07:44:39.651 --> 07:44:40.285

AND I AGREE I THINK PERSONAL

07:45:04.610 --> 07:45:06.078
ACCOUNTABILITY SHOULD BE PART OF

07:45:06.144 --> 07:45:07.145

TAKE WITHIN THREE DAYS.

07:46:17.716 --> 07:46:18.283
WE FULLY AGREE THAT THERE SHOULD

07:46:18.350 --> 07:46:19.618
BE ACCESS TO THAT MEDICATION AT

07:46:19.685 --> 07:46:20.252
A PHARMACY AND THAT THERE SHOULD

07:46:20.319 --> 07:46:20.419
BE.

07:46:20.485 --> 07:46:21.753
CERTAIN PROTECTIONS IN PLACE BUT

07:46:21.820 --> 07:46:23.588
THAT THERE SHOULD BE ACCESS TO

07:46:23.655 --> 07:46:25.023
THOSE MEDICATIONS THAT FORMS.

07:46:25.090 --> 07:46:26.458
SIR WE ARE DO YOU SEE THAT IS

07:46:26.525 --> 07:46:27.859
ACCURATE LIKE THE PEP IS IS

07:46:27.926 --> 07:46:30.095
SOMETHING THAT CAN BE EMERGENCY.

07:46:30.162 --> 07:46:31.463
FULLY ACCESS PHARMACIST COULD

07:46:31.530 --> 07:46:32.297
ISSUE.

07:46:32.364 --> 07:46:33.799
BUT ON THE PREP THEY HAVE TIME

07:46:33.865 --> 07:46:35.334
TO PREPARE IS THERE I DON'T KNOW

07:46:35.400 --> 07:46:36.702
THAT MUCH ABOUT IT SO IT IS

07:46:36.768 --> 07:46:38.503
THEIR TIME. TO PREPARE AND WORK

07:46:38.570 --> 07:46:40.405
WITH A PHYSICIAN SO COUPLE

07:46:40.472 --> 07:46:42.474
THINGS CAME A PERSONAL TERMS OF

THE CMA DID MAKE BAY THERE OFFER

07:46:44.876 --> 07:46:45.811
WAS TO STRIP PROP OUT OF THE

07:46:45.877 --> 07:46:46.411
BILL.

07:46:46.478 --> 07:46:48.547
AND TO LIMIT THE PHARMACIST

07:46:48.613 --> 07:46:51.450
PROVIDING PAP TO SEVEN DAYS NOT

07:46:53.385 --> 07:46:55.554
AND AND I MEANS SO YOU WHEN YOU

07:46:55.620 --> 07:46:57.589
ON THE PATH AFTER AN EXPOSURE

07:46:57.656 --> 07:47:00.025
YOU NEED TO STAY ON FOR TWENTY

07:47:00.092 --> 07:47:01.259
THREE DAYS I GET THE ANSWER TO

07:47:01.326 --> 07:47:02.527
SO THEY ARE THAT IT IS NOT

07:47:02.594 --> 07:47:03.995
OFFERED TO GIVE THE FOR THE FULL

07:47:04.062 --> 07:47:05.364
TWENTY DAYS JUST TO BE CLEAR.

07:47:05.430 --> 07:47:07.766
BUT TO YEAH IT PROP IS NOT AN

07:47:07.833 --> 07:47:10.569
EMERGENCY IN THE SAME WAY THAT --

07:47:10.635 --> 07:47:12.604
THAT HAPPENS BUT WHEN SOMEONE

07:47:12.671 --> 07:47:15.240
SAYS I THINK I'M AT RISK FOR

07:47:15.307 --> 07:47:16.274
WHATEVER REASON.

07:47:16.341 --> 07:47:18.243
AND IT COULD BE THAT THEY

07:47:18.310 --> 07:47:19.511
BECAUSE OF JUST BEAR THE LIFE OF

07:47:19.578 --> 07:47:21.346
THEIR LIVING IT COULD BE BECAUSE

07:47:21.413 --> 07:47:24.082
THE SEXUALLY OR BECAUSE OF

07:47:24.149 --> 07:47:25.784
INTRAVENOUS DRUG USE IT COULD BE

07:47:25.851 --> 07:47:27.219
BECAUSE PARTNER.

07:47:27.285 --> 07:47:29.654
HAS -- IT HAS HIV AND THEY WANT

07:47:29.721 --> 07:47:31.323
TO PROTECT THEMSELVES.

07:47:31.390 --> 07:47:32.491
IT'S NOT AN EMERGENCY IN THE

07:47:32.557 --> 07:47:34.593
SEMI PEPPERS BUT IT IS

07:47:34.659 --> 07:47:36.561
ABSOLUTELY TIME SENSITIVE AND WE

07:47:36.628 --> 07:47:38.130
HAVE SEEN SITUATIONS WHERE

07:47:38.196 --> 07:47:39.731
PEOPLE HAVE THE LADIES.

07:47:39.798 --> 07:47:40.999
AND GETTING ON CRAP AND THEY

07:47:41.066 --> 07:47:43.101
BECOME POSITIVE IN THE INTERIM

07:47:43.168 --> 07:47:45.270
AND SO YES IT IS IMPORTANT FOR

07:47:45.337 --> 07:47:48.340
PEOPLE NOT TO HAVE LONG --

07:47:48.407 --> 07:47:50.742
DELAYS AND YES YOU YOU'RE

07:47:50.809 --> 07:47:52.844
SUPPOSED TO HAVE ANY AN STD TEST --

07:47:52.911 --> 07:47:55.580
BUT BUT IT IS NOT THE CASE THAT

07:47:55.647 --> 07:47:57.182
HAVING AN S. T. D..

07:47:57.249 --> 07:47:58.316
MEANS THAT IT'S SOMEHOW

07:47:58.383 --> 07:48:01.119
DANGEROUS TO BE ON PROP -- WE

07:48:01.186 --> 07:48:02.788

07:48:35.620 --> 07:48:36.188
THIRD TIME AND WOULD BE UNDER

07:48:36.254 --> 07:48:37.289
THIS BILL TURNED AWAY FROM A

07:48:38.890 --> 07:48:40.492
EDUCATION WE FELT THAT WASA

07:48:40.559 --> 07:48:42.494
BARRIER AND WE SHOULD REMOVE IT

THESE BILLS WERE ALL NEGOTIATED

07:49:12.524 --> 07:49:13.859
AT THE TIME.

07:49:13.925 --> 07:49:14.860
THAT THEY WERE PASSING THE

07:49:14.926 --> 07:49:16.795

TO TAKE AWAY SOME OF THE TIES

07:49:41.786 --> 07:49:42.420
THAT OCCUR IN THE CURRENT

07:49:42.487 --> 07:49:44.756
LANGUAGE TO THE CDC GUIDELINES

07:49:44.823 --> 07:49:46.892

07:49:46.958 --> 07:49:48.326
THEY'RE ALSO TIES IN THIS BILL

07:49:48.393 --> 07:49:49.761

07:49:54.065 --> 07:49:55.767
ABOUT ADDITIONAL MEDICATIONS

07:49:55.834 --> 07:49:57.302
GOING THROUGH THE FTA CURRENTLY.

07:49:57.369 --> 07:49:58.436
THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW THOSE

07:49:58.503 --> 07:50:00.505
MEDICATIONS TO BE PROVIDED AT A

07:50:00.572 --> 07:50:02.073

TO THE LEGISLATURE.

07:50:03.141 --> 07:50:04.910
AND WE HAVE TO ADD THAT TO THE

07:50:04.976 --> 07:50:06.645
STATUE BECAUSE THE STATUTE IS SO

07:50:06.711 --> 07:50:08.013

WHICH WHICH COULD BE CHANGED AT

07:50:21.426 --> 07:50:27.432
ANY MOMENT AND SO TAKING OUT

07:50:27.499 --> 07:50:28.033

WE EXPAND SOME OF THE STRUCTURES

07:50:37.842 --> 07:50:38.910
THAT ARE IN THE CURRENT LAW.

07:50:38.977 --> 07:50:41.146

I SERVED AS AN EXPERT WITNESS.

08:16:18.815 --> 08:16:20.584
IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN

DISAPPEARED.

08:16:53.583 --> 08:16:55.785
BECAUSE SENIORS COULD EASILY

08:16:55.852 --> 08:16:58.555
TELL WHAT THE BENEFITS WERE IN

08:16:58.622 --> 08:17:00.090
THOSE POLICIES.

08:17:00.157 --> 08:17:02.359
AND COULD CHOOSE THE ADEQUATE

STANDARDIZED MEDIGAP POLICY

08:17:11.668 --> 08:17:13.803
MAKES IT A LOT MORE DIFFICULT

08:17:13.870 --> 08:17:15.071
FOR SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH

08:17:15.138 --> 08:17:17.407

APPROPRIATE COVERAGE.

08:17:18.808 --> 08:17:20.477

PEOPLE TO MAY.

08:17:32.222 --> 08:17:33.790

08:17:37.861 --> 08:17:40.030
WITH MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS

08:17:40.096 --> 08:17:41.631

08:17:45.135 --> 08:17:46.469

BUT THESE BENEFITS ARE NOT

08:17:48.238 --> 08:17:50.240
STANDARDIZED AND THEY APPEAR TO

08:17:50.307 --> 08:17:52.609
BE STANDARDIZED BECAUSE THEY'RE

TOPIC OF NEEDLE EXCHANGE PACIFIC

08:26:56.252 --> 08:26:58.287

SO WE'VE DONE QUITE A LOT OF

08:27:06.863 --> 08:27:08.097
RESEARCH ON THIS TOPIC.

08:27:08.164 --> 08:27:10.032
FROM A COUPLE THINGS THE FOR THE

08:27:10.099 --> 08:27:11.768
FIRST IS WE KNOW THESE ARE

08:27:11.834 --> 08:27:14.771
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY -- YOU KNOW

08:27:14.837 --> 08:27:16.572
THE WITH WITH THE OPIOID CRISIS

08:27:16.639 --> 08:27:18.374
RIGHT NOW -- THEY ARE QUITE GOOD

08:27:18.441 --> 08:27:20.243
AT AN ALMOST EVERYONE OF THESE

08:27:20.309 --> 08:27:21.477
ACTUALLY THINK ALMOST EVERYONE

08:27:21.544 --> 08:27:23.846
OF THESE PROGRAMS IN THE STATE.

08:27:23.913 --> 08:27:25.314
IS HANDING OUT AN UNLOCKS OWN

08:27:25.381 --> 08:27:27.350
HANOI CAM TO TWO PEOPLE TO

08:27:27.416 --> 08:27:29.185
PREVENT OVERDOSES WHICH IS

08:27:29.252 --> 08:27:31.654
SOMETHING THAT'S QUITE IMPORTANT --

08:27:31.721 --> 08:27:33.189
AND THEN OBVIOUSLY THE HIV AND

08:27:33.256 --> 08:27:39.595
VIRAL HEPATITIS THE NEW EXCHANGE

08:27:39.662 --> 08:27:41.764
HAS SHOWN TO WORK.

08:27:41.831 --> 08:27:43.800
AND SO THE THOSE ARE THOSE ARE

08:27:43.866 --> 08:27:44.901
JUST VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND NOT

08:27:44.967 --> 08:27:46.202
REALLY FOR CITY POLITICIANS TO

08:27:46.269 --> 08:27:47.203
MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT BUT READ

08:27:47.270 --> 08:27:48.037
THIS IS A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE

08:27:48.104 --> 08:27:49.272
THAT THE YOU KNOW THE PUBLIC

08:27:49.338 --> 08:27:50.406
PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH.

08:27:50.473 --> 08:27:51.440
ON THE OTHER THING IS -- ABOUT

08:27:51.507 --> 08:27:52.975
THESE NEEDLES THAT THAT THAT THE

08:27:53.042 --> 08:27:53.609
GERMANS TALKING ABOUT -- WE DID

08:27:53.676 --> 08:27:54.944
A STUDY THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN

08:27:55.011 --> 08:27:56.712
THAT -- IN THE JOURNAL CALLED A

08:27:56.779 --> 08:27:58.581
DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE A

08:27:58.648 --> 08:28:00.449
FEW YEARS AGO WE ACTUALLY.

08:28:00.516 --> 08:28:02.218
WENT TO TO CITIES SAN FRANCISCO

08:28:02.285 --> 08:28:04.453
WHICH HAS A VERY LARGE SCALE

08:28:04.520 --> 08:28:05.521
NEEDLE EXCHANGE.

08:28:05.588 --> 08:28:07.924
IN MIAMI FLORIDA WHICH DID NOT

08:28:07.990 --> 08:28:09.492
HAVE ANY LOOKS CHANGE THE TIME.

08:28:09.559 --> 08:28:11.961
AND WE DID A VISUAL WALKED BUYS

08:28:12.028 --> 08:28:13.496
OF THOUSAND RANDOM BLOCKS IN

08:28:13.563 --> 08:28:14.764
EACH OF THOSE AND IN EACH OF

08:28:14.831 --> 08:28:15.665
THOSE CITIES.

08:28:15.731 --> 08:28:17.600
AND WE FOUND WAS EIGHT TIMES

08:28:17.667 --> 08:28:20.570
MORE SYRINGES ON THE STREETS OF

08:28:20.636 --> 08:28:22.772
THE OF MIAMI THAN SAN FRANCISCO

08:28:22.839 --> 08:28:24.207
THAT'S BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE

08:28:24.273 --> 08:28:25.775
ANY LOW EXTENSION MIAMI.

08:28:25.842 --> 08:28:28.144
AND SO -- THIS PAPER VERY MUCH

08:28:28.211 --> 08:28:30.046
CLEARLY SHOWED THAT NEW EXCHANGE

08:28:30.112 --> 08:28:32.548

08:28:44.360 --> 08:28:46.128
NOT SOMETHING A COMMUNITY CAN

08:28:46.195 --> 08:28:46.929
JUST DECIDE ON ITS OWN WHETHER

08:28:46.996 --> 08:28:48.464
THEY SHOULD DO OR NOT TO DO --

08:28:48.531 --> 08:28:49.432
BUT RATHER THIS IS SOMETHING

08:28:49.498 --> 08:28:50.900

AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY --

09:03:46.961 --> 09:03:50.130
AND WE ARE OPPOSED TO ASK BEFORE

09:03:50.197 --> 09:03:50.698
FOR SIX ON WHEN IT COMES TO

09:03:50.764 --> 09:03:52.066
HYPERTENSION -- PHYSICIANS GO

09:03:52.132 --> 09:03:53.400
THROUGH A NUMBER STEPS WHEN

09:03:53.467 --> 09:03:55.369
LOOKING AT ON HOW TO MANAGE IS

09:03:55.436 --> 09:03:56.704
COMPLEX DISEASE STATE.

09:03:56.770 --> 09:03:58.405
AND ALL THIS INFORMATION THAT WE

09:03:58.472 --> 09:04:00.174
COMPILE GOES INTO THE PATIENT'S

09:04:00.240 --> 09:04:01.542
MEDICAL RECORD ONE OF OUR

09:04:01.608 --> 09:04:03.277
CONCERNS WITH THE BILL IS THAT

09:04:03.344 --> 09:04:04.578
THE PHARMACIST MAY NOT HAVE

09:04:04.645 --> 09:04:06.146
ACCESS TO THAT PATIENT'S MEDICAL

09:04:06.213 --> 09:04:06.880
RECORD.

09:04:06.947 --> 09:04:08.115
WHEN IT COMES TO TRYING TO

09:04:09.883 --> 09:04:11.652
WHAT TO INITIATE IN TERMS OF

09:04:11.719 --> 09:04:13.520
TREATMENTS THEY WON'T HAVE

09:04:13.587 --> 09:04:15.055
ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION -- WE

09:04:15.122 --> 09:04:16.957
ALSO BELIEVE THAT A PHARMACIST

09:04:17.024 --> 09:04:17.424
AND THEIR TRAINING AND

09:04:17.491 --> 09:04:19.293
BACKGROUND.

09:04:19.360 --> 09:04:20.527
ARE NECESSARILY -- TRAINED

09:04:20.594 --> 09:04:22.730
EXTENSIVELY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF

09:04:22.796 --> 09:04:24.465
HYPERTENSION I THINK IT'S WORTH

09:04:24.531 --> 09:04:25.833
MENTIONING THE SENATOR STONE'S

09:04:25.899 --> 09:04:27.134
MENTION THIS BILL IS LIMITED TO

09:04:27.201 --> 09:04:28.602
ADVANCE PRACTICE FARMER SAYS.

09:04:28.669 --> 09:04:30.037
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT THAT'S

09:04:30.104 --> 09:04:32.239
NOT THE CASE IT DOES APPLY TO

09:04:32.306 --> 09:04:32.706
THE ADVANCED PRACTICE

09:04:32.773 --> 09:04:33.507
PHARMACISTS.

09:04:33.574 --> 09:04:35.142

09:04:35.209 --> 09:04:36.944
FARMS AS WELL AND THAT'S REALLY

09:04:37.011 --> 09:04:38.612
WHERE I THINK WE HEAR MORE OF A

09:04:38.679 --> 09:04:40.047
CONCERNS AS WITH THE PHARMACIST

09:04:40.114 --> 09:04:42.182
IT ISN'T HAVE THAT ADVANCED.

09:04:42.249 --> 09:04:48.322
DEGREE WEATHER THERE ARE TRAINED

09:04:48.389 --> 09:04:49.323
IN MANAGING HYPERTENSION.

09:04:49.390 --> 09:04:50.591
WE WORRY THAT THE PHARMACIST WHO

09:04:50.657 --> 09:04:51.692
MAY NOT HAVE THAT TRAINING WILL

09:04:51.759 --> 09:04:53.827
INITIATE -- TREATMENTS THAT ARE

09:04:53.894 --> 09:04:55.462
NECESSARY OR APPROPRIATE AND

09:04:55.529 --> 09:04:56.563
THAT A LEAD TO INCREASED

09:04:56.630 --> 09:04:58.032
HEALTHCARE COSTS AT A TIME WHEN

09:04:58.098 --> 09:04:59.666
WE'RE TRYING TO DO QUITE THE

09:04:59.733 --> 09:05:03.637
OPPOSITE -- IN FOR THOSE REASONS --

09:05:03.704 --> 09:05:05.439
