REGION.

00:51:11.902 --> 00:51:12.736
WHAT ELECT FIVE STATE SENATORS

00:51:12.803 --> 00:51:13.904
AND?

00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:15.906
IT'S MORE REFLECTIVE OF OF WHAT

00:51:15.972 --> 00:51:17.874
WE WOULD CALL THE FEDERAL MODEL --

00:51:17.941 --> 00:51:19.943
A OF THE LEGISLATURE WHERE YOU

00:51:20.010 --> 00:51:21.178
HAVE ONE HOUSE BASED COMPLETELY

00:51:21.244 --> 00:51:23.480
ON POPULATION IN ONE HOUSE --

00:51:23.547 --> 00:51:25.182
PROVIDING FOR EQUALITY OF OF

00:51:25.248 --> 00:51:27.350
REPRESENTATION AMONG THE STATES

00:51:27.417 --> 00:51:27.884
IN THE CASE OF THE U. S.

00:51:27.951 --> 00:51:29.252
GOVERNMENT --

00:51:29.319 --> 00:51:30.954
HERE WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT

00:51:31.021 --> 00:51:33.323
THESE EIGHT REGIONS --

00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:35.058
SO LOOK I'M YOU KNOW I

00:51:35.125 --> 00:51:37.093
UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS PROBABLY.

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:38.795
NOT SOMETHING THAT'S LOOKED --

00:51:38.862 --> 00:51:41.198
YOU KNOW VERY HIGHLY UPON BY THE

00:51:41.264 --> 00:51:41.932
THEM ESPECIALLY IN THE MORE

00:51:41.998 --> 00:51:43.166
URBAN PARTS.

00:51:43.233 --> 00:51:45.402
A OF CALIFORNIA BUT WHAT I WOULD

00:51:45.469 --> 00:51:46.470
ASK YOU IS.

00:51:46.536 --> 00:51:49.940
TO AT LEAST REFLECT UPON --

00:51:50.006 --> 00:51:52.275
REPRESENTATION AND WHAT THAT

00:51:52.342 --> 00:51:53.743
REALLY MEANS YOU KNOW IS IT JUST

00:51:53.810 --> 00:51:56.112
BASED ON POPULATIONS POPULATION

00:51:56.179 --> 00:51:56.680
SOLELY WHAT WE'RE CONCERNED

00:51:56.746 --> 00:51:57.881
ABOUT.

00:51:57.948 --> 00:51:58.648
WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:51:58.715 --> 00:52:00.083
REPRESENTATION I WOULD ARGUE

00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:01.384
THAT IT'S NOT IN FACT?

00:52:01.451 --> 00:52:02.819
OUR FOUNDERS ACTUALLY POINTED

00:52:02.886 --> 00:52:03.920
THAT OUT --

00:52:03.987 --> 00:52:06.056
IN THE FEDERALIST PAPERS.

00:52:06.122 --> 00:52:07.457
WHEN THEY SAID ABOUT IT IN

00:52:07.524 --> 00:52:09.226
RELEVANT PART AND IT IS OF GREAT

00:52:09.292 --> 00:52:10.627
IMPORTANCE IN A REPUBLIC NOT

00:52:10.694 --> 00:52:11.561
ONLY TO GUARD?

00:52:11.628 --> 00:52:13.029
THE SOCIETY AGAINST THE

00:52:13.096 --> 00:52:14.865
OPPRESSION OF ITS RULERS.

00:52:14.931 --> 00:52:16.867
BUT TO GUARD ONE PART OF SOCIETY

00:52:16.933 --> 00:52:17.734
AGAINST THE INJUSTICE OF ANOTHER

00:52:17.801 --> 00:52:19.236
PART.

00:52:19.302 --> 00:52:20.570
DIFFERENT INTERESTS NECESSARILY

00:52:20.637 --> 00:52:21.605
EXIST IN DIFFERENT CLASSES OF

00:52:21.671 --> 00:52:23.940
CITIZENS IF THE MAJORITY BE

00:52:24.007 --> 00:52:25.942
UNITED BY ONE COMMON INTEREST IN

00:52:26.009 --> 00:52:27.177
THE INTEREST THE RIGHTS OF THE

00:52:27.244 --> 00:52:27.844
MINORITY.

00:52:27.911 --> 00:52:30.313
WILL BE INSECURE.

00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:31.715
AND SO WHAT WE SET UP IN THE

00:52:31.781 --> 00:52:33.183
FEDERAL MODEL WAS A WAVE OF

00:52:33.250 --> 00:52:34.851
GUARDING AGAINST THAT OF HAVING

00:52:34.918 --> 00:52:37.254
CHECKS AND BALANCES AGAINST.

00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:38.488
OF THE TYRANNY OF OF THE WITH

00:52:38.555 --> 00:52:40.090
THAT THERE CAN BE A TYRANNY OF

00:52:40.156 --> 00:52:41.591
THE MAJORITY YOU KNOW WHEN OF

00:52:41.658 --> 00:52:42.859
WHEN A MAJORITY.

00:52:42.926 --> 00:52:47.130
AND IS EITHER TEMPERED BY --

00:52:47.197 --> 00:52:49.065
YOU KNOW THE DEMAGOGUERY OR

00:52:49.132 --> 00:52:50.700
OTHERWISE --

00:52:50.767 --> 00:52:52.502
THEY CAN THEY CAN USE THAT

00:52:52.569 --> 00:52:55.338
MAJORITY THAT ROB POWER. TWO

00:52:55.405 --> 00:52:56.506
VIOLATE OF THE RIGHTS OF OF

00:52:56.573 --> 00:52:58.041
MINORITIES [inaudible]

00:52:58.108 --> 00:53:01.711
AND AND YOU KNOW I THINK THAT.

00:53:01.778 --> 00:53:02.345
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD

00:53:02.412 --> 00:53:04.414
ALWAYS BE GUARDING AGAINST BUT

00:53:04.481 --> 00:53:05.549
THE FACT OF THEMATTER HERE HERE

00:53:05.615 --> 00:53:06.550
IN CALIFORNIA'S WE HAVE NO SUCH

00:53:06.616 --> 00:53:08.718
GUARD.

00:53:08.785 --> 00:53:10.787
WE ELECTED GOVERNOR BASED ON ROB

00:53:10.854 --> 00:53:12.622
MAJORITY PLURALITY.

00:53:12.689 --> 00:53:14.257
WE ELECT ALL OF OUR ALL OF OUR

00:53:14.324 --> 00:53:15.859
LEGISLATIVE DISTRICTS ARE BASED

00:53:15.926 --> 00:53:17.761
PURELY ON POPULATION AND ARE

00:53:17.827 --> 00:53:19.729
ELECTED BY ROB POLITICAL --

00:53:19.796 --> 00:53:21.731
PLURALITIES ARE MAJORITIES --

00:53:21.798 --> 00:53:24.801
OUR OUR EVEN OUR JUDICIAL BRANCH

00:53:24.868 --> 00:53:26.469
THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES ARE

00:53:26.536 --> 00:53:27.037
UP FOR ELECTION EVERY SEVEN

00:53:27.103 --> 00:53:27.971
YEARS.

00:53:28.038 --> 00:53:30.874
AND THAT VOTE IS OF AGAIN A ROB

00:53:30.941 --> 00:53:32.742
POLITICAL MAJORITY THERE IS NO.

00:53:32.809 --> 00:53:34.544
CHECK LIKE WE HAVE WITH THE U.

00:53:34.611 --> 00:53:35.745
S. SENATE AND OTHER THINGS THAT

00:53:35.812 --> 00:53:38.048
WE HAVE HAD IN PLACE A IN THE US

00:53:38.114 --> 00:53:38.682
GOVERNMENT TO HELP PROVIDE THOSE

00:53:38.748 --> 00:53:40.016
CHECKS.

00:53:40.083 --> 00:53:41.651
AND AND BALANCES AND I THINK

00:53:41.718 --> 00:53:42.819
THAT'S A DEFICIENCY I THINK IT'S

00:53:42.886 --> 00:53:43.520
SOMETHING WE HAVE TO ADDRESS

00:53:43.587 --> 00:53:43.820
[inaudible]

00:53:43.887 --> 00:53:46.423
AND ONE THING THAT THE THE

00:53:46.489 --> 00:53:48.658
CHAIRMAN AND I SHARING COMMON

00:53:48.725 --> 00:53:50.060
ACTUALLY BUT ONE OF SEVERAL

00:53:50.126 --> 00:53:52.929
THINGS AND IS IT.

00:53:52.996 --> 00:53:53.897
WE BOTH HAVE IN OUR OWN

00:53:53.964 --> 00:53:56.466
DISTRICTS BACK HOME.

00:53:56.533 --> 00:53:57.667
PEOPLE ATTEMPTING --

00:53:57.734 --> 00:53:59.603
TO SPLIT THE STATE.

00:53:59.669 --> 00:54:01.972
THAT THAT WHAT THEY HAVE BECOME

00:54:02.038 --> 00:54:04.774
THAT THAT THAT ESSENTIALLY AND

00:54:04.841 --> 00:54:06.576
NO BREAK THAT DOWN A LITTLE BIT

00:54:06.643 --> 00:54:07.544
PEOPLE HAVE BECOME SO

00:54:07.611 --> 00:54:08.378
DISILLUSIONED WITH HOW THE

00:54:08.445 --> 00:54:09.012
REPRESENTATION STRUCTURE IS SET

00:54:09.079 --> 00:54:10.914
UP.

00:54:10.981 --> 00:54:11.948
THAT THEY WOULD RATHER SPLIT OFF

00:54:12.015 --> 00:54:13.817
AND FORM THEIR OWN STATE.

00:54:13.883 --> 00:54:16.553
THEN STAY PART OF CALIFORNIA.

00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:17.187
AND AND I THINK THAT'S A VERY

00:54:17.253 --> 00:54:19.055
REAL FRUSTRATION AND MANY NOT

00:54:19.122 --> 00:54:20.624
JUST IN MY DISTRICT NOT JUSTIN

00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:22.292
IN YOUR DISTRICT BUT IN MANY

00:54:22.359 --> 00:54:23.727
PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE PEOPLE

00:54:23.793 --> 00:54:25.895
DON'T FEEL LIKE THEIR VOICE.

00:54:25.962 --> 00:54:28.031
AND IS GETTING HEARD.

00:54:28.098 --> 00:54:29.332
AND IF WE LOOK AT THE HISTORY

00:54:29.399 --> 00:54:30.667
HERE WE HAVE OUR LEGISLATIVE

00:54:30.734 --> 00:54:32.469
STRUCTURE.

00:54:32.535 --> 00:54:33.970
WAS ESSENTIALLY ESTABLISHED BY

00:54:34.037 --> 00:54:36.740
THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION OF

00:54:36.806 --> 00:54:39.009
EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT AND THAT

00:54:39.075 --> 00:54:40.844
THAT IS YOU KNOW SINCE EIGHTEEN

00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:41.378
SEVENTY EIGHT WE HAVE NOT

00:54:41.444 --> 00:54:42.812
CHANGED.

00:54:42.879 --> 00:54:44.981
I REPRESENTATION STRUCTURE

00:54:45.048 --> 00:54:46.483
ESSENTIALLY WE HAVE FORTY FORTY

00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:48.485
SENATORS EIGHTY ASSEMBLY MEMBERS

00:54:48.551 --> 00:54:49.586
THAT'S WHERE IT'S BEEN SET IN

00:54:49.653 --> 00:54:51.621
STONE SINCE THEN.

00:54:51.688 --> 00:54:52.255
I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT JUST IN

00:54:52.322 --> 00:54:53.990
HISTORICAL CONTEXT.

00:54:54.057 --> 00:54:54.557
THAT WAS THE CONSTITUTIONAL

00:54:54.624 --> 00:54:56.059
CONVENTION IT WAS TAKEN OVER BY

00:54:56.126 --> 00:54:57.560
THE WORKING MEN'S PARTY.

00:54:57.627 --> 00:54:59.396
IN SAN FRANCISCO AND ALSO

00:54:59.462 --> 00:55:01.398
BROUGHT US CHINESE EXCLUSION.

00:55:01.464 --> 00:55:03.933
AND WE ALSO THERE WAS A LOT

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.435
GOING ON AND IN THAT CONTEXT

00:55:05.502 --> 00:55:06.536
THAT YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK WAS

00:55:06.603 --> 00:55:07.771
A VERY POSITIVE THING.

00:55:07.837 --> 00:55:09.139
AND YET WORSE WHERE WE'RE STILL

00:55:09.205 --> 00:55:10.907
USING THE SAME STRUCTURE THAT WE

00:55:10.974 --> 00:55:13.009
ESTABLISHED IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY

00:55:13.076 --> 00:55:14.210
EIGHT SO BOOK I THINK THAT THERE

00:55:14.277 --> 00:55:15.879
IS.

00:55:15.945 --> 00:55:17.881
A VERY MUCH AN ARGUMENT AND FOR

00:55:17.947 --> 00:55:19.315
US TO LOOK AT HOW WE MODERNIZE

00:55:19.382 --> 00:55:20.717
IT MAYBE THIS ISN'T THE ANSWER

00:55:20.784 --> 00:55:21.351
MAYBE THERE'S ANOTHER WAY TO DO

00:55:21.418 --> 00:55:23.653
THAT -- BUT

00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:28.358
I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT --

00:55:28.425 --> 00:55:29.359
AND ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS AS

00:55:29.426 --> 00:55:30.860
PUBLIC PEOPLE WHO SAY YOU KNOW

00:55:30.927 --> 00:55:32.829
LOOK WE WE ARE THEIR VOICE.

00:55:32.896 --> 00:55:33.997
BUT EACH OF US REPRESENTS

00:55:34.064 --> 00:55:35.098
FORKNER FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE

00:55:35.165 --> 00:55:36.099
OUR SENATORS REPRESENT ALMOST A

00:55:36.166 --> 00:55:37.834
MILLION.

00:55:37.901 --> 00:55:38.635
RIGHT THERE'S A LOT OF VOICES IN

00:55:38.702 --> 00:55:40.737
THERE [inaudible]

00:55:40.804 --> 00:55:42.706
THAT TIME.

00:55:42.772 --> 00:55:43.907
IT'S HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL

00:55:43.973 --> 00:55:44.974
VOICE IS AT LEAST GIVE IT THAT

00:55:45.041 --> 00:55:46.209
YOU KNOW SOME KIND OF SEAT AT

00:55:46.276 --> 00:55:48.044
THE TABLE SOME KIND OF VOICE AND

00:55:48.111 --> 00:55:49.946
LET ME JUST GIVE JUST SOME.

00:55:50.013 --> 00:55:52.649
AND IF YOU'LL INDULGE ME I KNOW.

00:55:52.716 --> 00:55:54.350
IS A YOU KNOW IF YOU WOULD

00:55:54.417 --> 00:55:55.885
INDULGE ME AND MISTER CHAIRMAN

00:55:55.952 --> 00:55:57.654
YEAH.

00:55:57.721 --> 00:55:58.955
LIKE I CAN SAY THIS I KNOW THEM

00:55:59.022 --> 00:56:00.090
THERE HOPEFULLY THEY'LL BE SOME

00:56:00.156 --> 00:56:01.791
QUESTIONS I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE

00:56:01.858 --> 00:56:04.327
SOME QUESTIONS BUT LET ME JUST

00:56:04.394 --> 00:56:05.295
GIVE YOU A COUPLE EXAMPLES JUST

00:56:05.361 --> 00:56:07.731
FROM FROM MY DISTRICT AND AS YOU

00:56:07.797 --> 00:56:09.733
KNOW YOU KNOW. FOR A LONG TIME

00:56:09.799 --> 00:56:10.734
UP IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE

00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:12.402
STATE TIMBER AND MINING WERE

00:56:12.469 --> 00:56:13.236
VERY.

00:56:13.303 --> 00:56:14.671
STRONG INDUSTRIAL SECTOR IT

00:56:14.738 --> 00:56:15.805
PROVIDE A LOT OF GOOD PAYING

00:56:15.872 --> 00:56:18.808
JOBS. FOR PEOPLE IN MY AREA.

00:56:18.875 --> 00:56:20.910
BUT LARGELY BECAUSE OF POLICIES

00:56:20.977 --> 00:56:22.612
SUPPORTED BY URBAN AREAS YOU

00:56:22.679 --> 00:56:24.013
KNOW BOTH BOTH INCOMING FROM THE

00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:24.814
FEDERAL LEVEL AND THE STATE

00:56:24.881 --> 00:56:25.849
LEVEL.

00:56:25.915 --> 00:56:27.383
BOTH THOSE INDUSTRIES SHUT DOWN

00:56:27.450 --> 00:56:28.017
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED IN

00:56:28.084 --> 00:56:29.385
THOSE.

00:56:29.452 --> 00:56:30.153
SHUT DOWN WE HAVE SEVERAL

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:31.855
GENERATIONS NOW.

00:56:31.921 --> 00:56:32.322
AND I'M IN SOME THESE

00:56:32.388 --> 00:56:33.857
COMMUNITIES THAT USED TO RELY ON

00:56:33.923 --> 00:56:35.191
THAT THAT.

00:56:35.258 --> 00:56:37.727
A OF DRUG ABUSE OF YOU KNOW

00:56:37.794 --> 00:56:39.796
PARENTS WHO LEFT THE SITUATION

00:56:39.863 --> 00:56:40.363
OF CHILDREN HAVE GROWN UP IN

00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:41.397
POVERTY.

00:56:41.464 --> 00:56:42.465
AND WITH NO OPPORTUNITIES YOU

00:56:42.532 --> 00:56:43.666
KNOW.

00:56:43.733 --> 00:56:45.268
AND LARGELY BECAUSE OF DECISIONS

00:56:45.335 --> 00:56:45.935
I GOT MADE BY SOMEBODY SOMEWHERE

00:56:46.002 --> 00:56:48.304
ELSE NOT BY PEOPLE WHO LIVE

00:56:48.371 --> 00:56:49.105
THERE.

00:56:49.172 --> 00:56:50.507
NOT BY PEOPLE WHO WHO EXPERIENCE

00:56:50.573 --> 00:56:52.041
THAT.

00:56:52.108 --> 00:56:52.976
AND THAT'S BEEN A VERY DIFFICULT

00:56:53.042 --> 00:56:54.177
THING -- FOR

00:56:54.244 --> 00:56:57.180
THAT REGION TO RECOVER FROM --

00:56:57.247 --> 00:56:58.381
THE THINGS THAT WE DO HAVE AND

00:56:58.448 --> 00:57:00.150
WE TRIED.

00:57:00.216 --> 00:57:02.152
TO THE PLANT THERE IS IS ONE OF

00:57:02.218 --> 00:57:03.953
THEM IS MANUFACTURING IS WE'VE

00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:05.755
HAD A GROWING MANUFACTURING

00:57:05.822 --> 00:57:07.323
SECTOR ESPECIALLY IN OR THOUGH

00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:07.957
WHICH YOU GUYS HAVE HEARD A LOT

00:57:08.024 --> 00:57:11.227
OF ABOUT --

00:57:11.294 --> 00:57:13.029
BUT THAT MANUFACTURING GROWTH

00:57:13.096 --> 00:57:14.697
HAS ACTUALLY BEEN HAMPERED.

00:57:14.764 --> 00:57:16.399
VERY MUCH SO BY SOME OF OUR

00:57:16.466 --> 00:57:19.002
GREENHOUSE GAS POLICIES.

00:57:19.068 --> 00:57:19.669
NO MAY JUST.

00:57:19.736 --> 00:57:21.204
END UP I REALLY THIS IS A REALLY

00:57:21.271 --> 00:57:22.806
IMPORTANT THING TO DRIVE HOME.

00:57:22.872 --> 00:57:23.373
pWE HAVE PRETTY CLEAN AIR THE

00:57:23.439 --> 00:57:24.974
NORTH STATE.

00:57:25.041 --> 00:57:26.943
NO I THINK THERE'S ONLY ONE PART

00:57:27.010 --> 00:57:27.477
OF MY DISTRICT IT'S IN NON

00:57:27.544 --> 00:57:28.711
ATTAINMENT.

00:57:28.778 --> 00:57:30.113
AND THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE HE GETS

00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:32.348
LUMPED IN WITH SACRAMENTO --

00:57:32.415 --> 00:57:34.317
AND THERE ARE QUALITY ISSUES AND

00:57:34.384 --> 00:57:34.951
SO THAT'S THE ONLY PART OF MY

00:57:35.018 --> 00:57:36.619
DISTRICT IT'S IN NON ATTAINMENT

00:57:36.686 --> 00:57:37.687
RIGHT NOW AND THEN A

00:57:37.754 --> 00:57:38.688
SENTIMENTALITY WOULD TELL YOU

00:57:38.755 --> 00:57:40.089
THE SAME THING [inaudible]

00:57:40.156 --> 00:57:42.625
AND YES SO.

00:57:42.692 --> 00:57:44.194
WE REALLY ACTUALLY NEED THE

00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:46.362
CARBON IF YOU WILL IN ORDER SUB

00:57:46.429 --> 00:57:48.131
SUPPORT OUR MANUFACTURING AND

00:57:48.198 --> 00:57:48.765
AND AND THE GROWTH THAT WE HAVE

00:57:48.832 --> 00:57:50.266
IN THERE.

00:57:50.333 --> 00:57:51.734
THE ONLY CARBON OUTPUT THAT WE

00:57:51.801 --> 00:57:52.302
REALLY DO HAVE IN THE NORTH

00:57:52.368 --> 00:57:53.970
STATE.

00:57:54.037 --> 00:57:55.004
THAT CREATES THAT THAT ACTUALLY

00:57:55.071 --> 00:57:56.272
CREATE SOME OF THE LARGEST

00:57:56.339 --> 00:57:57.874
CARBON OUTPUT IS OUR FORESTS

00:57:57.941 --> 00:58:00.710
BURNING EVERY YEAR.

00:58:00.777 --> 00:58:02.045
NEW CREATES MORE CARBON THAN

00:58:02.111 --> 00:58:03.847
THAN ANYTHING ELSE RIGHT.

00:58:03.913 --> 00:58:05.114
AND WHAT WE'VE LONG ARGUED FOR

00:58:05.181 --> 00:58:07.317
BUT WE CAN'T GET.

00:58:07.383 --> 00:58:08.952
MOSTLY BECAUSE OF URBAN NEAR

00:58:09.018 --> 00:58:10.653
POLICIES PASSED BY OUT OF THE

00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:12.589
URBAN PARTS THE STATE WHO AGAIN.

00:58:12.655 --> 00:58:13.156
PEOPLE WHO DON'T NECESSARILY

00:58:13.223 --> 00:58:14.257
LIVE THERE.

00:58:14.324 --> 00:58:15.925
DON'T HAVE AN INTERACTION WITH

00:58:15.992 --> 00:58:18.228
THE FORCE DON'T KNOW A LOT OF

00:58:18.294 --> 00:58:20.196
THE ISSUES THERE GET TO DECIDE.

00:58:20.263 --> 00:58:21.698
HOW THAT FORCED IS MANAGED AND

00:58:21.764 --> 00:58:23.867
IT'S LED TO THESE FORCE BECOMING

00:58:23.933 --> 00:58:25.435
TENDER BOXES THAT BURN EVERY

00:58:25.501 --> 00:58:25.935
YEAR?

00:58:26.002 --> 00:58:27.971

WE'VE GOT FIRES MIA ONCE AGAIN.

00:58:35.778 --> 00:58:36.913
ALL THAT THAT'S WHERE THE CARBON

00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:37.614
OUTPUT HAS COME FROM THE

00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:38.615
MEANWHILE.

00:58:38.681 --> 00:58:40.516

00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:45.188
BECAUSE THE COST OF PAYING

00:58:45.255 --> 00:58:47.523
CREDITS --

TO SET THEIR OWN LEGISLATURE'S

01:05:15.378 --> 01:05:17.113
AND IT ALSO GUARANTEES.

01:05:17.179 --> 01:05:18.981
AN ARTICLE FOR A REPUBLICAN FORM

01:05:19.048 --> 01:05:20.750

GOVERNMENT IN A SYSTEM OF CHECKS

01:05:25.454 --> 01:05:27.156

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:33.029
THE CASE LAW THAT'S AND BEEN

01:05:33.095 --> 01:05:34.163
INTERPRET OVERTIME AND PUBLIC

01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:37.133
THE THE THE LANDMARK CASE FOR

01:05:37.199 --> 01:05:38.968
OUR PURPOSES IS BAKER VERSES SR

01:05:39.035 --> 01:05:40.636
BAKER VERSUS CARR AND THEN --

01:05:40.703 --> 01:05:42.271
REYNOLDS VERSUS SIMS SAID THAT

01:05:42.338 --> 01:05:44.206
STATE LEGISLATIVE DISTRICTS NEED

01:05:44.273 --> 01:05:46.942
TO BE A EQUAL IN POPULATION

01:05:47.009 --> 01:05:47.743
RIGHT.

01:05:47.810 --> 01:05:48.778
AND THEN YOU KNOW THE ONE PART

01:05:48.844 --> 01:05:53.382
ONE PERSON ONE RULE --

01:05:53.449 --> 01:05:55.117
COUPLE THINGS [inaudible]

01:05:55.184 --> 01:05:58.587
A ONCE SINCE THAT TIME THERE HAS

01:05:58.654 --> 01:05:59.755
BEEN CASE LAW THAT SAYS THAT

01:05:59.822 --> 01:06:02.191
THEY WILL ALLOW DEVIATIONS AND

01:06:02.258 --> 01:06:03.592
WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO PROVIDE

01:06:03.659 --> 01:06:06.295
REPRESENTATION TO CERTAIN PARTS

01:06:06.362 --> 01:06:07.563
OF THE STATE'S OTHER WAS THE

01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:11.233
ARAB BROWN VERSUS THOMPSON CASE --

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:12.034
IN --

01:06:12.101 --> 01:06:13.969
WYOMING WHERE BASICALLY THERE

01:06:14.036 --> 01:06:15.438
REDISTRICTING IN THERE SET UP

01:06:15.504 --> 01:06:16.572
WAS THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:06:16.639 --> 01:06:18.307
EVERY COUNTY HAD AT LEAST ONE

01:06:18.374 --> 01:06:19.842
REPRESENTATIVE AND SO THEY HAD

01:06:19.909 --> 01:06:20.943
STRUCTURED THEIR ASSEMBLY IN

01:06:21.010 --> 01:06:22.411
THIS CASE.

01:06:22.478 --> 01:06:23.846
SO THAT AT LEAST THAT COUNT THE

01:06:23.913 --> 01:06:25.047
MOST RURAL COUNTY WOULD HAVE ONE

01:06:25.114 --> 01:06:26.382
REPRESENTATIVE.

01:06:26.449 --> 01:06:28.150
AND I DID THROW THINGS OFF KNOWS

01:06:28.217 --> 01:06:30.152
MORE THAN THE 10% --

01:06:30.219 --> 01:06:31.554
DEVIATION BUT THE COURT UPHELD

01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:33.622
IT AND SO THERE HAS BEEN SOME

01:06:33.689 --> 01:06:35.224
MOVEMENT TOWARD SAYING LOOK THIS

01:06:35.291 --> 01:06:36.625
IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO PROVIDE

01:06:36.692 --> 01:06:39.061
REPRESENTATION --

01:06:39.128 --> 01:06:41.530
WE WILL ALLOW SOME DEVIATIONS

01:06:41.597 --> 01:06:43.199
EVEN DEVIATIONS GREATER THAN.

01:06:43.265 --> 01:06:45.835
THAN 10% --

01:06:45.901 --> 01:06:47.203
AN OUT AND OUT.

01:06:47.269 --> 01:06:48.738
I WOULD ALSO ARGUE THAT LOOK --

01:06:48.804 --> 01:06:51.707
JUST BECAUSE A OF SUPREME COURT

01:06:51.774 --> 01:06:52.875
HAS RULED THAT SOMETHING IS

01:06:52.942 --> 01:06:54.510
UNCONSTITUTIONAL DOESN'T MEAN

01:06:54.577 --> 01:06:55.144
THAT THAT COURT CAN'T SAME COURT

01:06:55.211 --> 01:06:56.245
CAN'T.

01:06:56.312 --> 01:06:57.880
EVOLVE AND CHANGE ITS MIND OVER

01:06:57.947 --> 01:06:58.914
TIME ABOUT.

01:06:58.981 --> 01:07:00.416
THE ISSUES OF REPRESENTATION NOW

01:07:00.483 --> 01:07:02.351
IN THOSE CASES.

01:07:02.418 --> 01:07:04.520
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I

01:07:04.587 --> 01:07:05.855
THINK IS ACTUALLY WRONG AS YOU

01:07:05.921 --> 01:07:08.657
KNOW JUSTICE WARREN --

01:07:08.724 --> 01:07:10.092
AS WE KNOW JUST OF ONE WAS WRONG

01:07:10.159 --> 01:07:10.960
ABOUT LA THINGS INCLUDING

01:07:11.026 --> 01:07:12.795
JAPANESE INTERNMENT --

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:14.196
BUT IN HIS.

01:07:14.263 --> 01:07:16.699
IN HIS -- IN

01:07:16.766 --> 01:07:19.535
HIS OPINION HE SAID.

01:07:19.602 --> 01:07:22.538
LEGISLATORS DON'T REPRESENT.

01:07:22.605 --> 01:07:23.939
BOB GRABBED THE LEGISLATORS

01:07:24.006 --> 01:07:25.674
REPRESENT PEOPLE THEY DON'T

01:07:25.741 --> 01:07:27.643
REPRESENT ACRES IN TREES.

01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:30.413
I TAKE ISSUE WITH THAT.

01:07:30.479 --> 01:07:31.013
BECAUSE LET'S THINK ABOUT THAT

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:32.648
FOR A SECOND --

01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:33.682
I THINK VERY MUCH SO THAT WE

01:07:33.749 --> 01:07:35.551
REPRESENT.

01:07:35.618 --> 01:07:36.118
PEOPLE THAT REPRESENT TO YOU

01:07:36.185 --> 01:07:38.354
SOMEBODY.

01:07:38.421 --> 01:07:40.456
TAKE A VERY BIG THAT THAT SAY

01:07:40.523 --> 01:07:41.424
THEY REPRESENT A PLACE RIGHT

01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:41.724
[inaudible]

01:07:41.791 --> 01:07:43.492
YOU KNOW.

01:07:43.559 --> 01:07:44.794
NOT JUST THE PEOPLE AROUND THERE

01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:46.061
THAT IT LEAGUE THE TEN THAT PART

01:07:46.128 --> 01:07:48.697
BUT THEY REPRESENT THAT PLACE --

01:07:48.764 --> 01:07:49.598
PEOPLE THAT REPRESENT THE GREAT

01:07:49.665 --> 01:07:53.502
PORT OF OF LONG BEACH RIGHT --

01:07:53.569 --> 01:07:54.770
OUT ANY OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:07:54.837 --> 01:07:55.938
O'DONNELL IT SAID TAKE PRIDE IN

01:07:56.005 --> 01:07:57.306
THE IN THE FACT THAT THAT IS

01:07:57.373 --> 01:07:59.108
THAT IS A PLACE THAT IT IS A

01:07:59.175 --> 01:08:01.243
PLACE OF GREAT INDUSTRY AND SOME --

01:08:01.310 --> 01:08:03.245
AND AND ECONOMIC BENEFIT TO THAT

01:08:03.312 --> 01:08:04.780
REGION YOU KNOW IT'S NOT JUST

01:08:04.847 --> 01:08:06.649
THE PEOPLE BUT IT'S THE INDUSTRY.

01:08:06.715 --> 01:08:08.017
RIGHT -- I

01:08:08.083 --> 01:08:08.684
THINK THAT --

01:08:08.751 --> 01:08:10.986
WOULD SAY YOU KNOW THE THE BAY

01:08:11.053 --> 01:08:12.455

01:08:12.521 --> 01:08:13.255
THE DAY.

01:08:13.322 --> 01:08:14.623
RIGHT IS SOMETHING THAT'S VERY

01:08:14.690 --> 01:08:15.658
IMPORTANT TO PLACES NOT A SURLY

ACTUALLY NO TREES IS INTERESTING

01:08:30.673 --> 01:08:32.107
BECAUSE LIKE I SAID TREES ARE

01:08:32.174 --> 01:08:33.476
PRETTY IMPORTANT.

01:08:33.542 --> 01:08:34.477
HOW WE MANAGE OUR FORCE

01:08:34.543 --> 01:08:34.777
[inaudible]

01:08:34.844 --> 01:08:37.279
IS IMPORTANT IT'S LEADING THE

01:08:37.346 --> 01:08:38.981
HUGE CARBON OUTPUT BECAUSE OF

01:08:39.048 --> 01:08:40.950
THESE FORCE FIRES.

01:08:41.016 --> 01:08:43.319
AND IT'S IT'S BEEN OF THE HAMPER

01:08:43.385 --> 01:08:44.453
TO THE ECONOMY OF THOSE NOR

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:45.988
STATES NOT BEING ABLE TO DO

01:08:46.055 --> 01:08:48.324
RESPONSIBLE TIMBER HARVEST.

01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:50.392
AND IN THE NORTH STATE AND SO

01:08:50.459 --> 01:08:51.760
YET TREES ACTUALLY MATTERS QUITE

01:08:51.827 --> 01:08:54.163
A BIT ESPECIALLY IN CALIFORNIA.

01:08:54.230 --> 01:08:55.698
AND AND THE ACRES AND ACRES OF

01:08:55.764 --> 01:08:58.100
WATERSHED --

01:08:58.167 --> 01:08:59.902
THAT I REPRESENT.

01:08:59.969 --> 01:09:00.569
IS PRETTY IMPORTANT TO THE

01:09:00.636 --> 01:09:02.404
ENTIRE STATE

01:09:02.471 --> 01:09:03.506
AND HOW THAT'S MANAGE IN AND

01:09:03.572 --> 01:09:04.807
WHAT AND AND HOW THAT GOES INTO

01:09:04.874 --> 01:09:07.610
SO YES PEOPLE DO REPRESENT ACRES

01:09:07.676 --> 01:09:08.143
ENTRIES AND THAT'S REALLY

01:09:08.210 --> 01:09:09.345
IMPORTANT.

01:09:09.411 --> 01:09:10.913
AND SO THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S

01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:12.481
AN YOU KNOW OUR AS WE KNOW OUR

01:09:12.548 --> 01:09:14.817
SUPREME COURT CAN INVOLVE.

01:09:14.884 --> 01:09:15.885

01:09:15.951 --> 01:09:17.253
CHANGE ON DIFFERENT ISSUES I

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:19.021
THINK THIS IS ONE OF THEM.

01:09:19.088 --> 01:09:20.923
THAT REPRESENTATION IS MORE THAN

01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:22.658
JUST ENSURING EQUAL POPULATIONS

01:09:22.725 --> 01:09:24.126

DRAWING OF A MAJORITY.

01:09:32.701 --> 01:09:33.302
THE DRAWING OF MAJORITY MINORITY

01:09:33.369 --> 01:09:35.471
DISTRICTS HAS BEEN RULED

01:09:35.538 --> 01:09:36.272
UNCONSTITUTIONAL BY THE SUPREME

01:09:36.338 --> 01:09:38.073
COURT.

01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:39.341
HOWEVER.

01:09:39.408 --> 01:09:40.576
THAT HASN'T STOPPED US FROM

01:09:40.643 --> 01:09:42.044
SAYING LOOK CAN WE FIND WAYS TO

01:09:42.111 --> 01:09:44.179
ENSURE THAT MINORITY COMMUNITIES

01:09:44.246 --> 01:09:46.248
ARE ABLE TO ACTUALLY LEFT.

01:09:46.315 --> 01:09:47.816
PEOPLE OF THAT REPRESENT THEIR

01:09:47.883 --> 01:09:50.152
INTERESTS IN THEIR DISTRICTS

01:09:50.219 --> 01:09:51.353
RIGHT THAT HASN'T STOPPED US

01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:52.621
FROM DOING THAT IT WAS RULED

01:09:52.688 --> 01:09:53.489
UNCONSTITUTIONAL WE FOUND WAYS

01:09:53.556 --> 01:09:55.157
TO STILL DRAW DISTRICTS.

01:09:55.224 --> 01:09:56.926
THAT HELP ENSURE THAT MINORITY

01:09:56.992 --> 01:09:57.493
COMMUNITIES THOSE MINORITY

01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:59.495
VOICES HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF

01:09:59.562 --> 01:10:00.462
GETTING HEARD.

01:10:00.529 --> 01:10:01.630
I THINK WE CAN DO THE SAME THING

01:10:01.697 --> 01:10:03.098
WITHIN THE PARAMETERS OF SUPREME

01:10:03.165 --> 01:10:03.966

01:14:26.128 --> 01:14:27.162
HAVE TO HOUSES IF THEY'RE BOTH

01:14:27.229 --> 01:14:28.697
BASED ON POPULATION WHEN I JUST

01:14:28.764 --> 01:14:30.032
HAVE A UNICAMERAL.

01:14:30.098 --> 01:14:31.500
LEGISLATURE THERE'S YOU KNOW

01:14:31.567 --> 01:14:32.301
THERE'S A BIG STEP OF OUR

01:14:32.367 --> 01:14:34.336
PROCESS WE ALL WE ALL SCRAMBLING

01:14:34.403 --> 01:14:35.337
AROUND RIGHT NOW.

01:14:35.404 --> 01:14:36.772
GOING TO SEND THINGS BACK AND

01:14:36.839 --> 01:14:39.007
FORTH AND IN A LOT OF WAYS OUR

01:14:39.074 --> 01:14:40.976
JOB IS VERY SIMILAR WE REPRESENT

01:14:41.043 --> 01:14:42.711
BASED ON POPULATION.

01:14:42.778 --> 01:14:43.779
YOU KNOW I MEAN SO THERE'S

01:14:43.846 --> 01:14:45.414
ARGUMENTS ABOUT THAT BUT LET'S

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:47.316
LET'S SPUR THAT DISCUSSION OF

01:14:47.382 --> 01:14:47.916
BUT CERTAINLY WE CAN DO BETTER

01:14:47.983 --> 01:14:49.151
THAN.

01:14:49.218 --> 01:14:51.253
A WHAT WE CAME UP WITH AN

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:51.854
EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT IS THE

01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:52.788
ONLY THING THAT WORKS AND LET'S

01:14:52.855 --> 01:14:53.488
JUST KEEP.

01:14:53.555 --> 01:14:54.957
GOING ALONG THOSE LINES I THINK

01:14:55.023 --> 01:14:57.226
WE CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT AND

01:14:57.292 --> 01:14:59.428
AND I WOULD JUST ASK DOESN'T

01:14:59.494 --> 01:15:00.562
LOOK IT MAY REQUIRE.

01:15:00.629 --> 01:15:01.897
THE MEDICINE WITH THIS.

01:15:01.964 --> 01:15:03.866
IT MAY REQUIRE.

01:15:03.932 --> 01:15:05.534
URBAN AREAS TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT

01:15:05.601 --> 01:15:06.935
OF A STEP BACK SO THAT OTHER

01:15:07.002 --> 01:15:09.137
VOICES CAN BE HEARD.

01:15:09.204 --> 01:15:09.938
BUT IS THAT SUCH A BAD THING AND

01:15:10.005 --> 01:15:11.306
LET'S REMEMBER A LOT OF WHERE

01:15:11.373 --> 01:15:12.574
THE POPULATION BASE IS IN LOS

01:15:12.641 --> 01:15:14.209
ANGELES.

01:15:14.276 --> 01:15:17.512
THAT HAS BEEN MADE VIABLE BY.

01:15:17.579 --> 01:15:19.414
THE STATE WATER PROJECT RIGHT

01:15:19.481 --> 01:15:20.816
WHICH BRINGS WATER FROM THE

01:15:20.883 --> 01:15:22.684
NORTH DOWN TO THE SOUTH AND HAD

01:15:22.751 --> 01:15:24.186
THAT NOT BEEN THE CASE IT COULD

01:15:24.253 --> 01:15:25.721
NEVER SUPPORT THAT POPULATION

01:15:25.787 --> 01:15:27.322
HAD NOT ALL THE BOND PAIRS THE

01:15:27.389 --> 01:15:28.290
TAXPAYERS A CALIFORNIA PAID FOR

01:15:28.357 --> 01:15:30.459
THAT.

01:15:30.525 --> 01:15:31.894
THAT WOULD NOT BE THE CASE TODAY

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:33.562
RIGHT SO WE ALL KIND OF DEPEND

01:15:33.629 --> 01:15:35.297
ON EACH OTHER.

01:15:35.364 --> 01:15:36.565
AND SINCE ALLOWED ECONOMIC

01:15:36.632 --> 01:15:38.166
GROWTH IS GONE TO THAT AREA LOT

01:15:38.233 --> 01:15:39.501
OF THE BENEFITS YOU KNOW

01:15:39.568 --> 01:15:41.837
ECONOMICALLY THAT I WOULD SAY MY

01:15:41.904 --> 01:15:43.972
DISTRICT HAS MISSED OUT ON TO

01:15:44.039 --> 01:15:45.240
TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF A STEP BACK

01:15:45.307 --> 01:15:46.408
SO THAT OTHER VOICES CAN BE

01:15:46.475 --> 01:15:47.876
HEARD SO OTHERS CAN HAVE AT

01:15:47.943 --> 01:15:48.243
LEAST AN EQUAL.

01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:49.478
PLACE AT THE TABLE IS SOMETHING

01:15:49.544 --> 01:15:50.879
TO BE THINKING ABOUT AND IF WE

01:15:50.946 --> 01:15:52.681
DON'T.

01:15:52.748 --> 01:15:53.949
MY FEAR IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO

01:15:54.016 --> 01:15:56.251
SEE MORE OF THESE MOVEMENTS --

01:15:56.318 --> 01:15:57.619
TO TO SPLIT THE STATE I MEAN WHY

01:15:57.686 --> 01:15:59.321
NOT BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO WILL WHEN

01:15:59.388 --> 01:15:59.922
PEOPLE DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY'RE

01:15:59.988 --> 01:16:01.423
BEING HEARD --

01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:03.025
THEY TEND TO SAY LOOK IT'S TIME

01:16:03.091 --> 01:16:04.593
FOR US TO YOU KNOW.

01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:06.295
GO OUR OWN SEPARATE WAY.

01:16:06.361 --> 01:16:08.630
NON AND MAYBE YOU KNOW MAYBE

01:16:08.697 --> 01:16:10.299
THOSE MOVEMENTS WILL BE

01:16:10.365 --> 01:16:13.001
SUCCESSFUL OR NOT BUT ELISE THIS

01:16:13.068 --> 01:16:14.836
WOULD HELP US TRY TO ADDRESS I

01:16:14.903 --> 01:16:16.038
THINK DOES VERY LEGITIMATE

01:16:16.104 --> 01:16:16.939
CONCERNS IN ALL PARTS OF THE

01:16:17.005 --> 01:16:18.373

THE POINT THAT YOU'RE MAKING --

01:16:38.226 --> 01:16:39.661
WITH WHICH IS THAT WE ARE VERY

01:16:39.728 --> 01:16:41.229
DIVERSE DAY AND I REPRESENT

01:16:41.296 --> 01:16:42.631
SILICON VALLEY.

01:16:42.698 --> 01:16:44.166

LAST WEEK --

01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:53.442
AND SO.

01:16:53.508 --> 01:16:55.577
I'M CONSTANTLY TELLING MY

01:16:55.644 --> 01:16:56.511
CONSTITUENTS ARE AND AB ALSO HAD

01:16:56.578 --> 01:16:57.813
THE THE THE GOOD FORTUNE OF

01:16:57.879 --> 01:16:59.381
LIVING IN SOUTH DAKOTA --

01:16:59.448 --> 01:17:01.149
FOR OVER YEAR --

01:17:01.216 --> 01:17:02.718
BACK IN BETWEEN COLLEGE AND LAW

01:17:02.784 --> 01:17:03.485
SCHOOL -- IN

01:17:03.552 --> 01:17:04.720
AREAS THAT MAKE YOUR AREA LOOK

01:17:04.786 --> 01:17:06.388
URBAN --

01:17:06.455 --> 01:17:09.591
WINNER SOUTH DAKOTA POPULATION --

01:17:09.658 --> 01:17:10.625
THREE THOUSAND BEING THE BIGGEST

01:17:10.692 --> 01:17:12.794
CITY FOR A NINETY MILE RADIUS --

01:17:12.861 --> 01:17:13.395
BUT THE FOLKS AND AND WINNER

01:17:13.462 --> 01:17:16.164
SOUTH DAKOTA DIDN'T [inaudible]

01:17:16.231 --> 01:17:19.201
BECAUSE THE FOLKS FROM THE URBAN

01:17:19.267 --> 01:17:20.569
AREAS OF SOUTH DAKOTA AND THEN

01:17:20.635 --> 01:17:22.838
THE FOLKS IN THE RURAL AREAS --

01:17:22.904 --> 01:17:25.474
SHARED MORE IN TERMS OF THEIR

01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:28.143
IDEOLOGY ON ON CERTAIN ISSUES

01:17:28.210 --> 01:17:30.912
AND SO ON THE U. NO THEY THEY

01:17:30.979 --> 01:17:31.780
EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE THE

01:17:31.847 --> 01:17:33.582
SIMILAR ISSUES.

01:17:33.648 --> 01:17:35.050
THAT THAT YOU'RE MENTIONING

01:17:35.117 --> 01:17:36.785
TODAY THEY DIDN'T FEEL LIKE THAT

01:17:36.852 --> 01:17:40.222
THE I THINK --

01:17:40.288 --> 01:17:41.690
YOU MENTIONED THAT THIS WILL BE

01:17:41.757 --> 01:17:43.358
MODERNIZING OUR OUR

01:17:43.425 --> 01:17:44.993
REPRESENTATION SYSTEM BUT BUT I

01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:46.928
THINK.

01:17:46.995 --> 01:17:49.364
TAKING A SYSTEM THAT WAS CREATED

01:17:49.431 --> 01:17:50.799
NOTHING YOU SAID EIGHTEEN

01:17:50.866 --> 01:17:51.500
SEVENTY EIGHT AND MAKING IT LOOK

01:17:51.566 --> 01:17:53.101
LIKE A SYSTEM THAT WAS CREATED A

01:17:53.168 --> 01:17:54.870
HUNDRED YEARS EARLIER --

01:17:54.936 --> 01:17:56.238
IN THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTIES WITH

01:17:56.304 --> 01:17:57.606
TO THE WAY THE US SENATE SYSTEM

01:17:57.672 --> 01:17:59.074
IS SET UP ISN'T MODERNIZING

01:17:59.141 --> 01:18:00.409
ANYTHING --

01:18:00.475 --> 01:18:02.277
IT'S ACTUALLY GOING BACK --

01:18:02.344 --> 01:18:03.845
TO DECISION THAT WAS MADE BASED

01:18:03.912 --> 01:18:06.114
ON FACTORS THAT I THINK A LOT OF

01:18:06.181 --> 01:18:06.715
YOU KNOW OUR STAINS ON THIS

01:18:06.782 --> 01:18:08.016
COUNTRY --

01:18:08.083 --> 01:18:10.118
THAT GUERRA WE DETERMINED THAT

01:18:10.185 --> 01:18:12.154
THE SENATE REPRESENTATION BASED

01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:14.890
UPON TO MOLLIFY STATES OF THAT

01:18:14.956 --> 01:18:16.458
HAD PRACTICES THAT WE NOW LOOK

01:18:16.525 --> 01:18:18.493
AT AS A WARRANT --

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:20.395
AND SO AYE I'M YOU KNOW I AGREE

01:18:20.462 --> 01:18:21.663
WITH YOU THAT WE NEED TO HAVE A

01:18:21.730 --> 01:18:22.664
BETTER UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE

01:18:22.731 --> 01:18:24.633
REGIONS --

01:18:24.699 --> 01:18:25.967
WE NEED THE PEOPLE ON THE URBAN

01:18:26.034 --> 01:18:27.302
AREAS TO GO OUT TO THE RURAL

01:18:27.369 --> 01:18:28.770
AREAS AND UNDERSTAND THE VALUE

01:18:28.837 --> 01:18:30.472
THAT'S BEING CREATED.

01:18:30.539 --> 01:18:32.641
WE ALSO NEED TO FIND WAYS. TO UP

01:18:32.707 --> 01:18:34.109
LEFT TO THE RIVER THAT OR THE

01:18:34.176 --> 01:18:35.777
RURAL COMMUNITIES AND AND GET

01:18:35.844 --> 01:18:37.612
GOOD MANUFACTURING JOBS AND GET

01:18:37.679 --> 01:18:39.147
YOU KNOW GOOD TECH JOBS --

01:18:39.214 --> 01:18:41.550
AND AND FIND WAYS TO EXPAND THE

01:18:41.616 --> 01:18:43.985
ECONOMY THAT'S MADE CALIFORNIA

01:18:44.052 --> 01:18:45.153
SO STRONG --

01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:46.488
TO ALL OF CALIFORNIA --

01:18:46.555 --> 01:18:48.857
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THAT THIS

01:18:48.924 --> 01:18:49.991
MEASURE --

01:18:50.058 --> 01:18:51.593
IS THE WAY TO GO ABOUT THAT I

01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:52.260
THINK THIS MEASURE DOESN'T

01:18:52.327 --> 01:18:53.762
ENSURE QUALITY I THINK IT

01:18:53.829 --> 01:18:54.663
ACTUALLY CREATES.

01:18:54.729 --> 01:18:57.799
A INEQUALITY IN REPRESENTATION --

01:18:57.866 --> 01:18:58.333
THIS MEASURE DISCRIMINATES

01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:00.335
AGAINST SOME CAL POLITICAL

01:19:00.402 --> 01:19:02.504
REPRESENTATION --

01:19:02.571 --> 01:19:03.805
GIVING OTHER CALIFORNIANS MORE

01:19:03.872 --> 01:19:07.476
THAN SIX TIMES THE VOTING POWER.

01:19:07.542 --> 01:19:08.777
IT'S EXACTLY THIS TYPE OF

01:19:08.844 --> 01:19:09.744
DISCRIMINATION THAT THE US

01:19:09.811 --> 01:19:11.213
SUPREME COURT HAS MADE CLEAR IS

01:19:11.279 --> 01:19:12.981
UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND EVEN IF IN

01:19:13.048 --> 01:19:16.017
WARRANT UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND YES --

01:19:16.084 --> 01:19:17.619
OF THE NEW MAKE UP OF THE CORD

01:19:17.686 --> 01:19:19.654
THAT WAS DETERMINED BY THE U. S.

01:19:19.721 --> 01:19:23.425
SENATE IN THEIR INTRANSIGENCE IN --

01:19:23.492 --> 01:19:23.925
TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AN

01:19:23.992 --> 01:19:24.860
UNWILLINGNESS TO ACTUALLY DO

01:19:24.926 --> 01:19:26.394
THEIR JOB --

01:19:26.461 --> 01:19:29.197
HAS CREATED A SITUATION WHERE --

01:19:29.264 --> 01:19:30.398
MAYBE THIS WOULD BE DEEMED

01:19:30.465 --> 01:19:31.867
CONSTITUTIONAL BY THIS CURRENT

01:19:31.933 --> 01:19:33.235
SUPREME COURT WHO KNOWS I'M NOT

01:19:33.301 --> 01:19:35.570
INTERESTED IN FINDING OUT --

01:19:35.637 --> 01:19:37.139
AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS I'M

01:19:37.205 --> 01:19:38.940
UNABLE TO SUPPORT THIS MEASURE --

01:19:39.007 --> 01:19:40.342
AND RECOMMEND A NO VOTE BUT

01:19:40.408 --> 01:19:41.843
DEFINITELY DO LOOK FORWARD TO

01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:43.812
CONTINUING THIS CONVERSATION --

01:19:43.879 --> 01:19:45.247
AND AND FINDING WAYS THAT WE CAN

01:19:45.313 --> 01:19:46.748
INCREASE.

01:19:46.815 --> 01:19:48.083
WELL UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE

01:19:48.150 --> 01:19:49.284
REGIONS OF OUR REALLY DIVERSE

01:19:49.351 --> 01:19:51.219
STATE BECAUSE NOT MY

01:19:51.286 --> 01:19:52.387
CONSTITUENTS HAVE GOTTEN TIRED

01:19:52.454 --> 01:19:53.388
OF ME TELLING THEM THAT WHEN I

01:19:53.455 --> 01:19:55.590
WENT OUT TO VISIT --

01:19:55.657 --> 01:19:57.125
MODESTO --

01:19:57.192 --> 01:19:58.326
MODESTO REMINDED ME A LOT MORE

01:19:58.393 --> 01:19:59.961
SOUTH DAKOTA THAN IT DID SILICON

01:20:00.028 --> 01:20:00.795
VALLEY --

01:20:00.862 --> 01:20:03.498
AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT ALL OUR

01:20:03.565 --> 01:20:03.965
REGIONS --

01:20:04.032 --> 01:20:05.433
ALL ART ARE CALIFORNIANS

01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:06.701
UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE REALLY

01:20:06.768 --> 01:20:08.503
BIG DIVERSE STATE AND THAT WE

01:20:08.570 --> 01:20:10.172
RESPECT OUR DIFFERENCES.

01:20:10.238 --> 01:20:12.607
ARE A AND AND WORKED.

01:20:12.674 --> 01:20:14.809

01:20:17.512 --> 01:20:18.980
SUPPORT IT --

01:20:19.047 --> 01:20:19.681
BUT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO

01:20:19.748 --> 01:20:23.585
HAVING MORE COVER --

AND IT'S IS AS HIGH AS 21% THAT

01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:44.118
WAS BASED ON PARTISAN

01:28:44.185 --> 01:28:45.386
AFFILIATION.

01:28:45.453 --> 01:28:46.120

BY THE TIME THEY REACH A JUICY

01:28:58.700 --> 01:28:59.934
JUDICIAL RACES THEY MAY HAVE

01:29:00.001 --> 01:29:01.903
VOTED IN SO MANY OFFICES ALREADY

01:29:01.969 --> 01:29:03.071
THAT THEY SIMPLY CANNOT BE

01:29:03.137 --> 01:29:04.372

ADD IF I EXPAND THEIR IS --

01:32:05.653 --> 01:32:08.189
A SIMILAR CONSIDERATION OF BURKE

01:32:08.256 --> 01:32:08.956
THERE'S I'VE WE DON'T SEE ANY

01:32:09.023 --> 01:32:09.957
SUMMER CONSIDERATION OF

01:32:10.024 --> 01:32:11.792
FLEXIBILITY IN THIS PROPOSAL.

01:32:11.859 --> 01:32:13.661
I SECONDLY BALLOT HEADERS ARE

01:32:13.728 --> 01:32:15.630
CONTEST HEADERS AT THIS PROPOSAL

01:32:15.696 --> 01:32:17.798
CREATE SOME NEW FAQ CONTESTS

01:32:17.865 --> 01:32:18.366
HEADERS THAT WE NOW NEED TO

01:32:18.432 --> 01:32:19.800
ADDRESS.

01:32:19.867 --> 01:32:21.135
AND ANYTIME THAT WE REMOVE A

01:32:21.202 --> 01:32:22.570
REALISTIC FROM THAT BALLOT WE

01:32:22.637 --> 01:32:24.505
HAVE A CONCERN ALSO ESPECIALLY

01:32:24.572 --> 01:32:26.007
GIVENTHE LACK OF FLEXIBILITY ON

MOVING CONTESTS AROUND.

01:32:28.109 --> 01:32:29.477
I'D THAT THAT COULD CREATE A

01:32:29.543 --> 01:32:32.113
SOME ADDITIONAL COSTS BECAUSE WE

01:32:32.179 --> 01:32:34.849
NOW HAVE MORE ROOM TAKEN UP BY.

01:32:34.916 --> 01:32:36.484
THE HEADERS AND NO FLEXIBILITY

01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:37.652
SO WE'D LIKE TO SEE THAT

01:32:37.718 --> 01:32:39.887
POSSIBLY ADDRESS AND THEN

01:32:39.954 --> 01:32:43.724

CURRENT VERSION THE BILL DIDN'T

01:32:56.837 --> 01:32:57.738

THE COMPUTER ASSIGNS A DIFFERENT

01:34:41.008 --> 01:34:42.243

INCREASED COST TO DO THAT.

01:34:45.513 --> 01:34:46.747
THAT'S HAPPENS FROM ELECTION

01:34:46.814 --> 01:34:47.681

BUBBLE ASSIGNED FOR THE COMPUTER

01:34:52.153 --> 01:34:54.388
SCIENCE VALUES TO BUBBLES THAT'S

01:34:54.455 --> 01:34:56.090
ONE NUMBER TWO AS THE STATE

01:34:56.157 --> 01:34:58.526

01:35:09.703 --> 01:35:10.805
THING TO DO THE OTHER PIECES

ENOUGH MONEY IN LOCAL POLITICS.

01:37:11.892 --> 01:37:13.561

THERE'S NO VOICE.

01:37:35.182 --> 01:37:37.484
AND THE LO THE THE LOCAL VOICE

01:37:37.551 --> 01:37:39.653
WHICH IS MAYBE BE A SCHOOL BOARD

01:37:39.720 --> 01:37:40.354

SOMETIMES WILL DROWN OUT THE THE

01:37:57.705 --> 01:37:59.206
LOCAL EFFORTS I THINK THAT'S

01:37:59.273 --> 01:38:00.608
THAT'S THE POINT ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:38:00.674 --> 01:38:02.443

01:38:20.361 --> 01:38:21.929
A LIMIT ON HOW MUCH I CAN CARRY

01:38:21.996 --> 01:38:22.529
AND I DIDN'T WANT TO BURDEN

01:38:22.596 --> 01:38:23.430

NOW FOR LOCAL OFFICE NOT ONLY IS

01:38:34.742 --> 01:38:36.510

01:39:29.463 --> 01:39:29.596
MEAN?

01:39:29.663 --> 01:39:32.032
BY VOTER TURNOUT OR IS IT.

01:39:32.099 --> 01:39:34.268
TRY TO MAXIMIZE THE NUMBER OF

01:39:34.335 --> 01:39:36.870
VOTES THAT ARE MADE FOR LOCAL

01:39:36.937 --> 01:39:37.838
OFFICE GIVEN THE NUMBER OF

01:39:37.905 --> 01:39:39.540
BALLOTS WHAT'S THAT. TO

01:39:39.606 --> 01:39:41.575
DETERMINE SUCCESS WHAT IS THE

01:39:41.642 --> 01:39:42.843
NUMERATOR AND WHAT IS THE DID A

01:39:42.910 --> 01:39:45.045
DENOMINATOR IS IT IS IT BALLOTS

01:39:45.112 --> 01:39:48.515
CAST I IS IT I THE PERCENTAGE

01:39:48.582 --> 01:39:49.883
THAT YOU HAVE THAT HER.

01:39:49.950 --> 01:39:52.619
I THINK THE MORE DIRECT HERMES

01:39:52.686 --> 01:39:53.520
UNDERVOTES.

01:39:53.587 --> 01:39:54.388
ARE THAT THERE ARE FOR LOCAL

01:39:54.455 --> 01:39:56.190
OFFICE VERSUS BALLOT CAST OR IS

01:39:56.256 --> 01:39:59.059
IT UNDERVOTES OBVERSES TOTAL

01:39:59.126 --> 01:40:00.828
VOTING AGE ELIGIBLE POPULATION.

01:40:00.894 --> 01:40:02.496
PLEASE HELP ME IDENTIFY WHAT'S

01:40:02.563 --> 01:40:03.931
THE PROBLEM IT'S HARD UNDERVOTES

01:40:03.997 --> 01:40:05.299
THAT IS THE PROBLEM AND AND THE

01:40:05.366 --> 01:40:07.701
THEORY IS THIS.

01:40:07.768 --> 01:40:09.670
PEOPLE WILL GO JUST LIKE WE KNOW

01:40:09.737 --> 01:40:10.871
IN A GENERAL ELECTION MORE

01:40:10.938 --> 01:40:13.006
PEOPLE SHOW UP IN A GENERAL

01:40:13.073 --> 01:40:13.640
ELECTION BECAUSE THEY'RE OUT TO

01:40:13.707 --> 01:40:14.942
VOTE FOR THE PRESIDENT OR

01:40:15.008 --> 01:40:15.809
THEY'RE OUT TO VOTE FOR THE

01:40:15.876 --> 01:40:16.577
GOVERNOR.

01:40:16.643 --> 01:40:18.946
THE NAY VOTE IN A PRIMARY --

01:40:19.012 --> 01:40:20.614
MANY PEOPLE GO IN AND THEY JUST

01:40:20.681 --> 01:40:22.082
VOTE FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL CAN'T

01:40:22.149 --> 01:40:24.251
CANDIDATE OF THEIR CHOICE AND

01:40:24.318 --> 01:40:24.885
THEY GO HOME THEY DON'T GO DOWN

01:40:24.952 --> 01:40:25.652
BALLOT.

01:40:25.719 --> 01:40:28.722
SO THE THEORY IS THIS.

01:40:28.789 --> 01:40:29.757
PEOPLE SINCE WE'RE CONSOLIDATING

01:40:29.823 --> 01:40:33.427
THE ELECTION WE BELIEVE AS WELL

01:40:33.494 --> 01:40:35.996
AS MOST OF THE COUNTIES IN OR TO

01:40:36.063 --> 01:40:37.097
BE CITIES AN ALLEY COUNTIES

01:40:37.164 --> 01:40:37.398
[inaudible]

01:40:37.464 --> 01:40:40.267
THEY BELIEVE COLLECTIVELY THAT A

01:40:40.334 --> 01:40:41.869
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PEOPLE.

01:40:41.935 --> 01:40:43.670
WILL NOT GO DOWN BALLOT AND VOTE

01:40:43.737 --> 01:40:46.106
FOR EVERY SINGLE.

01:40:46.173 --> 01:40:47.975
ELECTION ON THAT BALLOT BECAUSE

01:40:48.041 --> 01:40:49.076
THEY'LL STOP AFTER THE HIGH

01:40:49.143 --> 01:40:50.811
PROFILE ELECTIONS SO WE BELIEVE

01:40:50.878 --> 01:40:51.345
THERE WILL BE SIGNIFICANT

01:40:51.412 --> 01:40:53.013
UNDERVOTES.

01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:55.983
AND THAT CONTRADICTS THE THEORY

01:40:56.049 --> 01:40:57.017
OF CONSOLIDATING THE ELECTIONS

01:40:57.084 --> 01:40:58.552
IN THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE THE

01:40:58.619 --> 01:40:59.820
GOAL WAS TO INCREASE TURNOUT ON

01:40:59.887 --> 01:41:01.455
THE LOCAL LEVEL.

01:41:01.522 --> 01:41:03.690
CONVERSELY WE BELIEVE THAT WHEN

01:41:03.757 --> 01:41:04.792
PEOPLE OPEN UP THEIR BOOK AND

01:41:04.858 --> 01:41:06.160
THEY SEE THEIR LOCAL SCHOOL

01:41:06.226 --> 01:41:07.394
BORDER THEIR LOCAL MAYOR THEIR

01:41:07.461 --> 01:41:09.229
LOCAL.

01:41:09.296 --> 01:41:11.598
SCHOOL PARCEL TAX WHATEVER IT IS.

01:41:11.665 --> 01:41:13.267
THEY'LL DO THE LOCAL RACES AND

01:41:13.333 --> 01:41:14.935
THEY HAVE AN INCENTIVE TO GO

01:41:15.002 --> 01:41:16.003
DOWN TO VOTE FOR THE PRESIDENT

01:41:16.069 --> 01:41:16.804
THEY'RE NOT GONNA GO THERE NOT

01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:17.838
GOING TO VOTE ON THE LOCAL

01:41:17.905 --> 01:41:19.473
ELECTION AND GO HOME.

01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:20.574
THEY'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO THEY

01:41:20.641 --> 01:41:22.142
GET TO THE HIGH PROFILE ACTIONS.

01:41:22.209 --> 01:41:23.744
WE BELIEVE THAT IS GOING TO BE

01:41:23.811 --> 01:41:24.745
THEIR BEHAVIOR WE THINK THAT

01:41:24.812 --> 01:41:27.347
SERVES DEMOCRACY IN THE CITIES

01:41:27.414 --> 01:41:28.715
AND WE ALSO BELIEVE IT SERVES

01:41:28.782 --> 01:41:30.451
DEMOCRACY FOR THE FOR THE STATE

01:41:30.517 --> 01:41:31.452
AND AND FEDERAL LAW ELECTIONS AS

01:41:31.518 --> 01:41:33.320
WELL.

01:41:33.387 --> 01:41:34.588
AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING

01:41:34.655 --> 01:41:35.222
TO WE'RE GONNA DO A LOT A CITY

01:41:35.289 --> 01:41:36.323
SECTION.

01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:38.425
I COUNTY SECTION.

01:41:38.492 --> 01:41:40.194
STATE SECTION AND A FEDERAL

01:41:40.260 --> 01:41:41.829
SECTION IT ACTUALLY FOLLOWS A A

01:41:41.895 --> 01:41:44.765
LOGICAL ORDERLY PROGRESSION OF

01:41:44.832 --> 01:41:45.599
THOUGHTS.

01:41:45.666 --> 01:41:46.433
AND WE THINK THAT MATCHES

01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:46.733
[inaudible]

01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:49.436
THE VOTERS.

01:41:49.503 --> 01:41:50.737
MENTALITY AS WELL THE GONNA

01:41:50.804 --> 01:41:51.338
THINK LOCAL THAN THE GONNA GO

01:41:51.405 --> 01:41:52.473
COUNTY.

01:41:52.539 --> 01:41:54.775
STATE AND FEDERAL.

01:41:54.842 --> 01:41:57.945
YEAH IF I COULD ASK TO CLARIFY I

01:41:58.011 --> 01:41:59.413
WITH THE AMENDMENTS AS A PILOT

01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:01.682
PROJECT.

01:42:01.748 --> 01:42:03.350
WHAT WHAT IS THE TIMEFRAME THAT

01:42:03.417 --> 01:42:06.086
WE HAVE HERE IS IT THAT THE

01:42:06.153 --> 01:42:06.987
BALLOT ORDER IN LOS ANGELES

01:42:07.054 --> 01:42:10.390
COUNTY IS GOING TO FLIP OVER

01:42:10.457 --> 01:42:12.159
420-002-02020 AND THEN IT WILL

01:42:12.226 --> 01:42:13.594
FLIP BACK IN LESS AYE?

01:42:13.660 --> 01:42:15.796
FURTHER LEGISLATION IS THE IDEA

01:42:15.863 --> 01:42:18.499
IS TO PROVIDE DATA FROM BOTH A

01:42:18.565 --> 01:42:20.100
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND THEN

01:42:20.167 --> 01:42:21.568
AN OFF YEAR ELECTION SO THERE

01:42:21.635 --> 01:42:23.303
WOULD BE TWO CYCLES.

01:42:23.370 --> 01:42:23.904
SO WE WOULD GET THE DATA FROM

01:42:23.971 --> 01:42:25.873
TWO CYCLES.

01:42:25.939 --> 01:42:27.574
A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND THEN

01:42:27.641 --> 01:42:28.342
A GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION WE

01:42:28.408 --> 01:42:30.744
THINK THAT'S A PRUDENT.

01:42:30.811 --> 01:42:32.779
STEP AND THEN FRANKLY WE'RE

01:42:32.846 --> 01:42:34.548
TRYING TO EMPOWER THE LOCAL SO

01:42:34.615 --> 01:42:35.148
IF THE COUNTY REGISTRAR LIKES

01:42:35.215 --> 01:42:37.084
THIS.

01:42:37.150 --> 01:42:38.051
THEY DON'T HAVE TO COME BACK TO

01:42:38.118 --> 01:42:39.253
THE LEGISLATURE TO CONTINUE

01:42:39.319 --> 01:42:41.154
SOMETHING THEY LIKE.

01:42:41.221 --> 01:42:42.256
BUT IF THEY DECIDE THEY DON'T

01:42:42.322 --> 01:42:43.490
LIKE IT.

01:42:43.557 --> 01:42:44.691
IT WOULD SUNSET AND I WOULD GO

01:42:44.758 --> 01:42:46.059
BACK WOULD REVERT BACK.

01:42:46.126 --> 01:42:48.028
SO WE THINK IT GIVES THE DATA

01:42:48.095 --> 01:42:48.762
THAT.

01:42:48.829 --> 01:42:50.531
EVERYBODY WANTS WE THINK IT WILL

01:42:50.597 --> 01:42:52.566
SOLVE THE PROBLEM THAT WE THINK

01:42:52.633 --> 01:42:54.368
EXISTS AND WE THINK THAT'S A

01:42:54.434 --> 01:42:56.737
PROPER COMMONSENSE CONCLUSIONS.

01:42:56.803 --> 01:42:58.539
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN IF I

01:42:58.605 --> 01:42:59.907
IF I MAY MENTION.

01:42:59.973 --> 01:43:00.541
LA I APPRECIATE THE

01:43:00.607 --> 01:43:03.277
CLARIFICATION ON THAT WAS MADE --

01:43:03.343 --> 01:43:04.478
THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE OF

01:43:04.545 --> 01:43:05.879
COURSE ARE SWITCHING ELECTION

01:43:05.946 --> 01:43:07.414
ORDERS AND THEN POTENTIALLY

01:43:07.481 --> 01:43:09.049
SWITCHING BACK I THINK THAT

01:43:09.116 --> 01:43:10.250
COULD LEAD.

01:43:10.317 --> 01:43:14.254
TO AYE A GREATER DEGREE OF A OF

01:43:14.321 --> 01:43:15.455
VOTER CONFUSION --

01:43:15.522 --> 01:43:17.291
ESPECIALLY THE TIME WHEN IN LOS

01:43:17.357 --> 01:43:19.192
ANGELES COUNTY AYE WE JUST HAD A

01:43:19.259 --> 01:43:20.661
SITUATION WHERE I THINK WAS A

01:43:20.727 --> 01:43:22.129
HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE --

01:43:22.195 --> 01:43:23.463
WERE LEFT OFF THE VOTER ROLLS OR

01:43:23.530 --> 01:43:25.098
WE'RE HAVING CHALLENGES IN TERMS

01:43:25.165 --> 01:43:27.100
OF BEING ABLE TO VOTE SO I'M NOT

01:43:27.167 --> 01:43:29.102
SURE IF LOS ANGELES COUNTY --

01:43:29.169 --> 01:43:31.538
IS THE RIGHT LOCATION OUGHT TO

01:43:31.605 --> 01:43:33.540
DO THIS IF IT WAS WORTH WHILE TO

01:43:33.607 --> 01:43:36.843
DO A HIM ON A PILOT PROJECT.

01:43:36.910 --> 01:43:39.613
I WOULD COUNTER UP PROPOSE A

01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:41.281
THAT I THINK THAT THE ISSUES

01:43:41.348 --> 01:43:41.882
THAT ARE BROUGHT UP ARE VALID

01:43:41.949 --> 01:43:42.883
POINTS.

01:43:42.950 --> 01:43:44.918
I THAT THERE ARE IS A LOT OF

01:43:44.985 --> 01:43:47.254
NOISE AND IT'S VERY HARD TO

01:43:47.321 --> 01:43:49.156
DIFFERENTIATE YOUR RACE --

01:43:49.222 --> 01:43:50.190
WIN NOW THERE'S ALL THESE

01:43:50.257 --> 01:43:52.392
FEDERAL AND STATE RACES THEY'RE

01:43:52.459 --> 01:43:53.827
GOING ON IVERSON'S LOCAL

01:43:53.894 --> 01:43:57.030
ELECTIONS AND SO I THINK THAT --

01:43:57.097 --> 01:43:58.065
A PROPOSAL THAT WOULD ACTUALLY

01:43:58.131 --> 01:44:01.034
ACCOMPLISH THAT IS FAR SIMPLER

01:44:01.101 --> 01:44:02.869
AND NOT SIMPLY BY REPEALING AYE

01:44:02.936 --> 01:44:05.405
S. B. FOUR ONE FIVE FROM TWENTY

01:44:05.472 --> 01:44:07.274
FIFTEEN THAT FORCES LOS ANGELES

01:44:07.341 --> 01:44:07.975
COUNTY.

01:44:08.041 --> 01:44:10.077
BY TWO I HAVE THESE ELECTIONS

01:44:10.143 --> 01:44:11.178
AND INSTEAD ALLOWS THEM TO HAVE

01:44:11.244 --> 01:44:12.813
FREESTANDING ELECTIONS AND THAT

01:44:12.879 --> 01:44:14.448
WAY I THINK THAT YOU'LL GET WHAT

01:44:14.514 --> 01:44:15.849
YOU'RE LOOKING --

01:44:15.916 --> 01:44:17.417
FOR WHICH IS TO HAVE OUR FEWER

01:44:17.484 --> 01:44:19.119
UNDERVOTES.

01:44:19.186 --> 01:44:20.621
UP MORE PEOPLE WHO ARE TURNING

01:44:20.687 --> 01:44:21.755
OUT TO PARTICIPATE ARE

01:44:21.822 --> 01:44:22.656
PARTICIPATING IN ALL THE

01:44:22.723 --> 01:44:24.191
ELECTIONS ON THE BALLOT.

01:44:24.257 --> 01:44:26.827
AND WERE AVOIDING VIA THE NOISE

01:44:26.893 --> 01:44:28.328
SITUATION WHERE I'M MAILERS

01:44:28.395 --> 01:44:30.230
MAYBE DISTRACTING OR OTHER

01:44:30.297 --> 01:44:31.698
FACTORS MAY BE DISTRACTING AND I

01:44:31.765 --> 01:44:33.200
THINK THAT THAT WOULD SOLVE THE

01:44:33.266 --> 01:44:33.734
ISSUE.

01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:35.502
I AM PERHAPS OF BRINGING FORWARD

01:44:35.569 --> 01:44:36.937
IN THE IN THE NEXT --

01:44:37.004 --> 01:44:38.472
SESSION I WOULD BE AN

01:44:38.538 --> 01:44:39.640
OUTSTANDING IDEA --

01:44:39.706 --> 01:44:40.741
I JUST THINK THAT THERE'S A

01:44:40.807 --> 01:44:45.345
DIFFERENT SOLUTION.

01:44:45.412 --> 01:44:46.413
THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR ANY

01:44:56.189 --> 01:44:57.591
SEE WHAT THAT DOES IN TERMS OF

01:44:57.658 --> 01:44:59.826
HOW BALLOT DROP OFF WHICH IS A

01:44:59.893 --> 01:45:01.762
SIGNIFICANT ISSUE I KNOW THAT

01:45:01.828 --> 01:45:03.830
LOS ANGELES WILL AT SOME POINT I

01:45:03.897 --> 01:45:04.898

01:45:38.932 --> 01:45:40.467
RACES AND NOT RETURNING.

01:45:40.534 --> 01:45:42.436
OUGHT TO TO THE DEL MAR

01:45:42.502 --> 01:45:44.204
LOCALIZED RACES BUT WILL LEARN

01:45:44.271 --> 01:45:45.906
THAT ARE IN THE PILOT WHEN YOU

01:45:45.972 --> 01:45:47.240
COMPARE TYPICALLY VS ELECTION

01:45:47.307 --> 01:45:49.142
CYCLES SO I AM VERY INTRIGUED BY

01:45:49.209 --> 01:45:50.210
THIS I WILL SUPPORT IT IF IT

01:45:50.277 --> 01:45:52.279
DOESN'T HAVE A MOTION ALL MOVE

01:45:52.345 --> 01:45:55.248
IT. ONE QUESTION NO.

01:45:55.315 --> 01:45:56.416
DOES THE DECEIT ULTIMATE

01:45:56.483 --> 01:45:59.219
DECISION IN THE COUNTY RIVER TO

01:45:59.286 --> 01:46:01.254
THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS

01:46:01.321 --> 01:46:04.524
TO CONTINUE THE PILOT OR IS THAT

01:46:04.591 --> 01:46:08.962
JUST A DECISION ARE TO BE MADE

01:46:09.029 --> 01:46:14.434
BY THE LOCAL REGISTRAR.

01:46:14.501 --> 01:46:16.369
I WAS ANTICIPATING THE REGISTRAR --

01:46:16.436 --> 01:46:17.838
BECAUSE THEY ARE THE CHIEF

01:46:17.904 --> 01:46:21.074
ELECTIONS OFFICIAL --

01:46:21.141 --> 01:46:21.908
AND THAT WAY IT'S NOT PART OF

01:46:21.975 --> 01:46:24.111
THE POLITICAL PROCESS BUT IF YOU

01:46:24.177 --> 01:46:26.713
HAVE A BETTER IDEA.

01:46:26.780 --> 01:46:27.414
YOU KNOW.

01:46:27.481 --> 01:46:28.048
I JUST THINK THAT'S THE PERSON

01:46:28.115 --> 01:46:29.015
WHO'S ENTRUSTED WITH MAKING THE

01:46:29.082 --> 01:46:30.117
DECISION --

01:46:30.183 --> 01:46:31.685
I'M FINE WITH THAT I'M FINE WITH

01:46:31.752 --> 01:46:32.252
THAT'S MY THUMB I JUST WAS

01:46:32.319 --> 01:46:33.320
CURIOUS IF IT WAS CALLED OUT OF

01:46:33.386 --> 01:46:34.554
THE BILL SO MAYBE TO AN AWKWARD

01:46:34.621 --> 01:46:35.055
IF YOU DID NOT SEE THAT

01:46:35.122 --> 01:46:35.822
AMENDMENT SO --

01:46:35.889 --> 01:46:37.624
WE CAN CLARIFY THAT TO ME.

01:46:37.691 --> 01:46:39.025
THAT'S MY THINKING THAT THE

01:46:39.092 --> 01:46:40.193
CHIEF ELECTIONS OFFICIAL.

01:46:40.260 --> 01:46:40.794
THE WHO'S GONNA HAVE THE MOST

01:46:40.861 --> 01:46:41.461
IMMEDIATE.

01:46:41.528 --> 01:46:42.662
UNDERSTANDING OF WHETHER THIS

01:46:42.729 --> 01:46:44.397
WAS SUCCESSFUL OR NOT AND THEN

01:46:44.464 --> 01:46:45.899
IT WOULDN'T BE POLITICAL THAT

01:46:45.966 --> 01:46:47.134
WOULD BE MY SUGGESTION.

01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:48.535
IN THEM MY ONLY COMMENT THERE

01:46:48.602 --> 01:46:49.503
WOULD BE IF YOU CAN CONFER WITH

01:46:49.569 --> 01:46:51.905
THE LOGAN ABOUT THAT AND AND THE

01:46:51.972 --> 01:46:53.106
CLERKS.

01:46:53.173 --> 01:46:55.375
TICKET FOR THAT THAT'S THEIR

01:46:55.442 --> 01:46:57.477
CHOSEN APPROACH --

01:46:57.544 --> 01:46:58.044
BUT WITHOUT ALMOST THE BILL

01:46:58.111 --> 01:46:59.546
WOULD IT'S REALLY MOTION THE

01:46:59.613 --> 01:47:00.847
SECOND.

01:47:00.914 --> 01:47:01.414
ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR

01:47:01.481 --> 01:47:03.817
COMMENTS.

01:47:03.884 --> 01:47:05.118
SENATE PORTANTINO GEORGIA CLOSE

01:47:05.185 --> 01:47:06.219
JUST THAT I THINK THE

01:47:06.286 --> 01:47:07.854
CONVERSATION IS IMPORTANT WHEN

01:47:07.921 --> 01:47:08.522
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT VOTER

01:47:08.588 --> 01:47:10.490
TURNOUT AND AGAIN I APPRECIATE

01:47:10.557 --> 01:47:12.159
THE CHAIR WHO FROM LAST YEAR HAS

01:47:12.225 --> 01:47:13.260
SHOWN AN INTEREST IN.

01:47:13.326 --> 01:47:14.294
TRYING TO MOVE THIS ALONG TO GET

01:47:14.361 --> 01:47:15.695
THE DATA THE SO WE CAN WELL

01:47:15.762 --> 01:47:17.297
SERVE THE PUBLIC SO WITH THAT

01:47:17.364 --> 01:47:18.064

CONVERSATION THAT THAT WE'VE HAD

01:47:21.935 --> 01:47:23.203
TODAY I THINK NO QUESTION WAS

01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:24.471
RAISED THERE WITH THIS ADDRESS

01:47:24.538 --> 01:47:25.438

TURNOUT OR WHAT'S THE GOAL HERE --

01:47:29.609 --> 01:47:31.311
AND AND I THINK THE THE ANSWER

01:47:31.378 --> 01:47:35.348
WAS RIGHT WOULD BOTH GOALS ARE

01:47:35.415 --> 01:47:36.750
GOOD GOALS AND WE SHOULD

01:47:36.817 --> 01:47:38.652
