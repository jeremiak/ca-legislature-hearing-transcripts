CHALLENGES- IS WRITTEN NOW THE

01:13:51.293 --> 01:13:52.594
IT'S SORT OF IMPOSSIBLE TO

01:13:52.661 --> 01:13:54.596
COMPLY WITH THE MINIMUM WAGE IN

01:13:54.663 --> 01:13:56.999
CALIFORNIA'S EYES FROM WHICH- I

01:13:57.065 --> 01:13:58.967
THINK IN THE COUNTRY. IN TERMS

01:13:59.034 --> 01:14:01.069
STATES AND YOU KNOW WHEN YOU

01:14:01.136 --> 01:14:02.471
ADJUST FOR CURRENCY RATES WE

01:14:02.538 --> 01:14:04.072
CAN ALWAYS ALMOST COULD BE

01:14:04.139 --> 01:14:04.606
HIGHER THAN ALL OF SOUTH

01:14:04.673 --> 01:14:07.109
AMERICA SO- WHAT ARE YOUR

01:14:07.176 --> 01:14:08.644
THOUGHTS ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL

01:14:08.710 --> 01:14:09.878
THING AND I'M NOT ASKING FOR

01:14:09.945 --> 01:14:10.913
LIKE A LEGAL OPINION BUT

01:14:10.979 --> 01:14:11.747
WHETHER THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S

01:14:11.814 --> 01:14:13.048
BEEN THOUGHT THROUGH ADDRESSED

01:14:13.115 --> 01:14:14.183
THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS DID

01:14:14.249 --> 01:14:15.517
RAISE THAT ISSUE DID NICE JOB

01:14:15.584 --> 01:14:17.653
OF. KIND OF GOING THROUGH IT-

01:14:17.719 --> 01:14:18.821
AND THEN ARE YOU OPEN TO

01:14:18.887 --> 01:14:20.088
POTENTIALLY NARROWING THE BILL

01:14:20.155 --> 01:14:21.657
AT SOME POINT TO DO THE

01:14:21.723 --> 01:14:23.425
PESTICIDE AND CHILD LABOR

01:14:23.492 --> 01:14:25.561
PEACE. SO THANK YOU FOR THE

01:14:25.627 --> 01:14:26.662
QUESTION THE FIRST AS WE DO

01:14:26.728 --> 01:14:29.998
HAVE A LEGAL. RIGHT COMING

01:14:30.065 --> 01:14:32.935
FROM- LET'S COUNCIL THE BILL

01:14:33.001 --> 01:14:35.370
HAS VERY SPECIFICALLY- BEEN

01:14:35.437 --> 01:14:37.206
FOCUSED ON THE ISSUE OF HEALTH

01:14:37.272 --> 01:14:39.041
AND SAFETY RIGHT. AND NOT THE

01:14:39.107 --> 01:14:41.410
ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH

01:14:41.476 --> 01:14:43.312
INTERSECT WITH THE COMMERCE

01:14:43.378 --> 01:14:45.214
CLAUSE CONCERNS THAT YOU RAISE-

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:47.049
THE NARROWING OF THE BILL IS

01:14:47.115 --> 01:14:48.383
THE ACTUAL PRODUCTS THAT HAVE

01:14:48.450 --> 01:14:49.985
BEEN SELECTED. AND THEIR

01:14:50.052 --> 01:14:52.154
AVAILABILITY YEAR ROUND TO TRY

01:14:52.221 --> 01:14:54.857
NOT TO GET INTO- THE ISSUES

01:14:54.923 --> 01:14:56.758
THAT THE GROCERS ASSOCIATION

01:14:56.825 --> 01:15:00.829
DRESSED ADDRESSED. DE UM ISSUE

01:15:00.896 --> 01:15:02.097
OF THE LABOR WE'RE CERTAINLY

01:15:02.164 --> 01:15:04.566
OPEN TO THAT BUT YOU KNOW THOSE

01:15:04.633 --> 01:15:07.035
ARE VERY FUNDAMENTAL. ISSUES

01:15:07.102 --> 01:15:08.604
THAT WE'VE ADOPTED HERE IN

01:15:08.670 --> 01:15:11.306
CALIFORNIA AS STANDARDS RIGHT-

01:15:11.373 --> 01:15:13.242
HUMAN RIGHTS STANDARDS- LIVING

01:15:13.308 --> 01:15:16.478
LIVING WAGE FOR WORKERS. IN

01:15:16.545 --> 01:15:18.013
CALIFORNIA AND THE ISSUE OF

01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:20.382
HEALTH AND SAFETY AND SO THOSE

01:15:20.449 --> 01:15:24.152
TWO COMPONENTS. ARE CRITICAL-

01:15:24.219 --> 01:15:24.786
TO HOW WE DO BUSINESS CAL. AND

01:15:24.853 --> 01:15:26.655
HOW WE SHOULD EXPECT PEOPLE

01:15:26.722 --> 01:15:28.924
DOING BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA-

01:15:28.991 --> 01:15:30.692
TO OPERATE IN SO I'M I'M OPEN

01:15:30.759 --> 01:15:32.427
TO LOOKING AT IT IN. THE

01:15:32.494 --> 01:15:35.497
INTEREST OF AVOIDING ANY LEGAL

01:15:35.564 --> 01:15:37.332
CHALLENGES BUT LOOK WE ALSO

01:15:37.399 --> 01:15:39.468
BELIEVE THAT WITH PROP TWO. AND

01:15:39.534 --> 01:15:43.205
PROP TWELVE THAT PASSED IN TWO

01:15:43.272 --> 01:15:45.374
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THAT- FOCUSED

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:47.276
ON THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF.

01:15:47.342 --> 01:15:49.811
CHICKENS AND OTHER ANIMALS WE

01:15:49.878 --> 01:15:51.546
THINK THAT THERE'S PRECEDENT.

01:15:51.613 --> 01:15:53.081
AROUND THE ISSUE OF HEALTH AND

01:15:53.148 --> 01:15:56.752
SAFETY. THAT APPLIES. TO THIS

01:15:56.818 --> 01:15:58.387
PARTICULAR PROPOSAL THAT'S

01:15:58.453 --> 01:16:01.290
BEFORE YOU TODAY. SHORT ANSWER

01:16:01.356 --> 01:16:03.225
OPEN TO THE IDEA ON THE LABOR.

01:16:03.292 --> 01:16:05.894
BUT I BELIEVE THAT- BOTH THE

01:16:05.961 --> 01:16:07.262
HAVE THE SAFETY IN THE LABOR

01:16:07.329 --> 01:16:08.764
ARE TWO PRINCIPLES THAT WE

01:16:08.830 --> 01:16:12.034
SHOULD LIVE BY STAND BY. AND

01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:14.069
APPLY THEM ACCORDINGLY- WHEN

01:16:14.136 --> 01:16:16.738
WE'RE EXPECTING OTHER PRODUCE

01:16:16.805 --> 01:16:19.107
TO BE SOLD- TO CALIFORNIANS AND

01:16:19.174 --> 01:16:21.243
REALLY- THAT'S REALLY THE FOCUS

01:16:21.310 --> 01:16:24.913
OF THE BILL BUT VERY OPEN- TO

01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:25.414
THOSE DISCUSSIONS MOVING

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:32.387
FORWARD. ASSEMBLY MEMBER IRWIN-

01:16:32.454 --> 01:16:34.456
YES THANK YOU AND I HAD OF SOME

01:16:34.523 --> 01:16:36.091
OF THE SAME CONCERNS AS

01:16:36.158 --> 01:16:37.626
ASSEMBLY MEMBER CUNNINGHAM BUT

01:16:37.693 --> 01:16:39.461
I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE

01:16:39.528 --> 01:16:40.829
TRYING TO DO HERE BECAUSE FOR

01:16:40.896 --> 01:16:41.964
YEARS WE'VE BEEN HEARING FROM

01:16:42.030 --> 01:16:45.901
OUR FARMERS THAT- THAT THE

01:16:45.968 --> 01:16:48.337
VALUES WE HOLD HERE AS

01:16:48.403 --> 01:16:50.539
CALIFORNIANS AS FAR AS A LABOR

01:16:50.605 --> 01:16:52.975
ISSUES AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES

01:16:53.041 --> 01:16:55.043
ARE MAKING THE PRODUCE IN

01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:57.179
CALIFORNIA MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE

01:16:57.245 --> 01:16:59.114
AND SO- THIS SORT OF WOULD

01:16:59.181 --> 01:17:00.649
LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD IF

01:17:00.716 --> 01:17:03.185
THERE'S SOME WAY TO. GET IT

01:17:03.251 --> 01:17:06.722
THROUGH LEGALLY SO I DO LIKE OF

01:17:06.788 --> 01:17:07.923
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE

01:17:07.990 --> 01:17:10.759
AS FAR AS A HIGH- MENTIONED SO

01:17:10.826 --> 01:17:13.228
COULD YOU GO OVER AGAIN HOW YOU

01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:14.863
PICKED THESE PRODUCTS BECAUSE

01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:16.465
CERTAINLY SEEMS LIKE SOME OF

01:17:16.531 --> 01:17:18.400
THE PRODUCTS ARE FAIRLY

01:17:18.467 --> 01:17:21.136
SEASONAL- I KNOW THAT- FOR

01:17:21.203 --> 01:17:23.171
INSTANCE IN VENTURA COUNTY THAT

01:17:23.238 --> 01:17:24.940
THAT BLUEBERRIES ARE GROWN OVER

01:17:25.007 --> 01:17:28.010
A VERY. SHORT PERIOD OF TIME

01:17:28.076 --> 01:17:31.380
SO- HOW WOULD WE MAKE SURE THAT

01:17:31.446 --> 01:17:34.249
CONSUMERS ARE NOT OF BLOCKING

01:17:34.316 --> 01:17:36.251
ACCESS TO- FRUITS AND

01:17:36.318 --> 01:17:37.519
VEGETABLES CERTAIN TIMES OF THE

01:17:37.586 --> 01:17:40.155
YEAR SO WE REACHED OUT TO THE

01:17:40.222 --> 01:17:42.758
WIDE ARRAY OF AG ASSOCIATIONS

01:17:42.824 --> 01:17:46.928
INCLUDING THE FARM PAYROLLS THE

01:17:46.995 --> 01:17:48.897
AG COUNCILS AND THEN WE GOT

01:17:48.964 --> 01:17:52.167
VERY SPECIFIC TO THE ACTUAL-

01:17:52.234 --> 01:17:54.469
PRODUCERS OF THE SPECIFIC-

01:17:54.536 --> 01:17:57.005
FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. AND

01:17:57.072 --> 01:17:57.873
THERE WERE SOME INTERESTING

01:17:57.939 --> 01:17:59.274
CONVERSATIONS WITH SOME OF THE

01:17:59.341 --> 01:18:01.410
GROUPS WHERE THE ACTUAL FARMERS

01:18:01.476 --> 01:18:03.211
WANTED TO BE INCLUDED BUT THE

01:18:03.278 --> 01:18:08.050
ASSOCIATION'S. DIDN'T SEE THE-

01:18:08.116 --> 01:18:09.551
POLITICAL INTERESTS GIVEN THE

01:18:09.618 --> 01:18:11.953
WIDE ARRAY OF FARMERS AT THE

01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:13.922
REPRESENT OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA

01:18:13.989 --> 01:18:15.590
AS WELL. AND SO THERE WERE SOME

01:18:15.657 --> 01:18:16.958
CONFLICTS BETWEEN THERE AND

01:18:17.025 --> 01:18:19.528
I'LL GIVE YOU THE EXAMPLE- THE

01:18:19.594 --> 01:18:20.529
FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THAT WERE

01:18:20.595 --> 01:18:22.964
PICKED. WE'VE BEEN GUARANTEED

01:18:23.031 --> 01:18:25.767
THAT THEY ARE MADE AVAILABLE-

01:18:25.834 --> 01:18:26.401
AND GROWN IN SPECIFIC PARTS OF

01:18:26.468 --> 01:18:29.104
THE STATE. ALL YEAR ROUND AND

01:18:29.171 --> 01:18:30.739
THERE ARE REGIONS IN CALIFORNIA

01:18:30.806 --> 01:18:33.308
THAT CAN DO THAT RIGHT- THE

01:18:33.375 --> 01:18:36.845
EXAMPLE WAS. A LOT OF PRODUCE.

01:18:36.912 --> 01:18:40.215
IS GROWN YEAR ROUND AND- WE HAD

01:18:40.282 --> 01:18:42.551
SOME CONVERSATIONS WITH FOLKS

01:18:42.617 --> 01:18:44.419
FOR EXAMPLE THE BLUEBERRIES

01:18:44.486 --> 01:18:47.422
THAT WERE ADDED LATER. BY

01:18:47.489 --> 01:18:49.991
REQUEST OF THE INDUSTRY. AFTER

01:18:50.058 --> 01:18:51.693
DISCUSSING WITH ALL OF THEIR

01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:53.962
PRODUCERS THAT IT'S VERY

01:18:54.029 --> 01:18:56.098
POSSIBLE TO PROVIDE THESE YEAR

01:18:56.164 --> 01:18:58.366
ROUND FROM CALIFORNIA. AND SO

01:18:58.433 --> 01:19:01.436
WE PUT OUT A CALL TO ALL OF THE

01:19:01.503 --> 01:19:03.305
ASSOCIATION'S. WITH THE HELP OF

01:19:03.371 --> 01:19:05.273
ORGANIZATIONS KIND OF THE CALL

01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:06.741
THE UMBRELLA ORGANIZATIONS LIKE

01:19:06.808 --> 01:19:08.276
FARM BUREAU WESTERN GROWERS AND

01:19:08.343 --> 01:19:10.712
OTHERS WHO LED US TO THESE-

01:19:10.779 --> 01:19:12.547
ASSOCIATIONS THAT REPRESENT THE

01:19:12.614 --> 01:19:14.382
SPECIFIC FRUITS AND VEGETABLES

01:19:14.449 --> 01:19:15.317
AND THAT'S HOW WE CAME UP WITH

01:19:15.383 --> 01:19:17.385
THE LISTEN. WE BELIEVE THAT IT

01:19:17.452 --> 01:19:21.289
IS A MODEST. LIST OF- PRODUCED

01:19:21.356 --> 01:19:24.092
VEGETABLES AND FRUITS THAT WE

01:19:24.159 --> 01:19:26.161
CAN COMPLY WITH AT THAT OUR

01:19:26.228 --> 01:19:29.798
SHELVES WILL NOT BE LEFT EMPTY-

01:19:29.865 --> 01:19:32.100
WELL WITH OUT THOSE PRODUCTS

01:19:32.167 --> 01:19:33.802
BECAUSE THE FARMERS THEMSELVES

01:19:33.869 --> 01:19:35.470
HAS SAID TO US. THAT THEY'RE

01:19:35.537 --> 01:19:37.873
ABLE TO MEET THOSE EXPECTATIONS

01:19:37.939 --> 01:19:39.674
AND PLAN FOR AND PLAN FOR A

01:19:39.741 --> 01:19:43.879
DEMAND IF NEEDED- TO STOCK UP.

01:19:43.945 --> 01:19:46.615
SO I SPECIFICALLY ALSO I

01:19:46.681 --> 01:19:48.783
APPRECIATE THAT THAT- THAT THE

01:19:48.850 --> 01:19:49.784
WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE IN THIS

01:19:49.851 --> 01:19:52.053
AREA SPECIFICALLY- I SEE

01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:53.388
LONDON'S ON THE LIST BUT I

01:19:53.455 --> 01:19:56.024
DON'T SEE A CITRUS MUTUAL ON

01:19:56.091 --> 01:19:57.826
THE SUPPORT LIST I ASSUME THAT

01:19:57.893 --> 01:19:59.728
THEY REPRESENT MANY. OF

01:19:59.794 --> 01:20:01.630
MULTINATIONAL ENTITIES TO AND

01:20:01.696 --> 01:20:03.265
THAT THAT THAT WAS THE CONFLICT

01:20:03.331 --> 01:20:05.667
BUT FARTHER. IN GENERAL THE

01:20:05.734 --> 01:20:08.470
LEMON GROWERS WANTED TO BE.

01:20:08.537 --> 01:20:11.373
THEN COLLUDED THE LEMON GROWERS

01:20:11.439 --> 01:20:12.908
IN COACHELLA VALLEY PERIL

01:20:12.974 --> 01:20:15.544
VALLEY. OTHER PARTS OF THE

01:20:15.610 --> 01:20:18.046
STATE MOST DEFINITELY. WANT TO

01:20:18.113 --> 01:20:20.682
BE INCLUDED. THE ASSOCIATION'S

01:20:20.749 --> 01:20:23.051
I BELIEVE. AND THEY CAN SPEAK

01:20:23.118 --> 01:20:24.452
FOR THEMSELVES I BELIEVE ARE

01:20:24.519 --> 01:20:27.956
CONFLICTED. WITH THE OTHER.

01:20:28.023 --> 01:20:30.225
PRODUCING INTEREST OUTSIDE OF

01:20:30.292 --> 01:20:34.462
CALIFORNIA SO LOOK FOR ME RIGHT

01:20:34.529 --> 01:20:37.299
I REPRESENT CALIFORNIA- OUR

01:20:37.365 --> 01:20:40.502
PRIORITY IS CALIFORNIANS AND

01:20:40.569 --> 01:20:42.671
THE PROTECTION OF CONSUMERS-

01:20:42.737 --> 01:20:45.040
THEIR HEALTH AND WELL BEING AND

01:20:45.106 --> 01:20:46.608
WE'RE ALSO WANTING TO MAKE SURE

01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:49.544
THAT- AS WE ADOPT THESE RULES

01:20:49.611 --> 01:20:51.413
AND REGULATIONS THAT THEY'RE

01:20:51.479 --> 01:20:53.848
APPLICABLES- IN HOLDING THAT

01:20:53.915 --> 01:20:56.851
SAME STANDARD. FOR GOODS THAT

01:20:56.918 --> 01:20:58.620
COME INTO CALIFORNIAN ARE SOLD

01:20:58.687 --> 01:20:59.621
OKAY AND THEN ONE MORE

01:20:59.688 --> 01:21:02.691
QUESTION- AS FAR AS- WHEN WE

01:21:02.757 --> 01:21:03.992
TALK ABOUT WHICH OF THE

01:21:04.059 --> 01:21:06.728
FARMWORKER WAGES WE DO HAVE

01:21:06.795 --> 01:21:08.730
OBVIOUSLY MINIMUM WAGE BUT WE

01:21:08.797 --> 01:21:11.132
HAVE- PEACE RIGHT ALSO SO OUR

01:21:11.199 --> 01:21:16.404
ART IS. THAT WHAT TYPE OF- WAGE

01:21:16.471 --> 01:21:21.876
TO OTHER STATES HAVE TO ADOPT.

01:21:21.943 --> 01:21:22.410
TO BE ABLE TO IMPORTANT TO

01:21:22.477 --> 01:21:23.545
CALIFORNIA. WHAT WHAT WE HAVE

01:21:23.612 --> 01:21:25.747
IN THE BILL AS IT'S CURRENTLY

01:21:25.814 --> 01:21:28.083
PRESENTED IS THE MINIMUM WAGE.

01:21:28.149 --> 01:21:29.050
THAT THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

01:21:29.117 --> 01:21:31.786
FOCUSED ON RIGHT IS AT MEETING

01:21:31.853 --> 01:21:34.556
THAT- STANDARD ACROSS THE BOARD

01:21:34.623 --> 01:21:36.992
THAT WE BELIEVE AGAIN IS JUST

01:21:37.058 --> 01:21:40.629
ONE COMPONENT- TO HIGHLIGHT THE

01:24:02.670 --> 01:24:04.639
THE STATE. FOR US THE REAL

01:24:04.706 --> 01:24:08.676
QUESTION IS A- WHOSE FIRST. WHO

DO WE PRIORITIZE FIRST AND WHY

01:24:11.446 --> 01:24:13.181
AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY AT

01:24:13.248 --> 01:24:16.251
THE CORE OF- THE QUESTION- FOR

01:24:16.317 --> 01:24:19.454

BRINGING THIS FORWARD- I AM IN

01:24:29.931 --> 01:24:30.999
THE SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY WE

01:24:31.065 --> 01:24:31.933
TALKED ABOUT IT IT IS AN

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.935
INTERESTING. CONCEPT BECAUSE

01:24:34.002 --> 01:24:35.737
WE'VE HEARD IT A FEW TIMES.

01:24:35.804 --> 01:24:36.604
SINCE I'VE BEEN IN THIS

01:24:36.671 --> 01:24:39.107
BUILDING. THE REGULATIONS AND

01:24:39.174 --> 01:24:40.442
THE BURDEN THAT WE PUT ON.

01:24:40.508 --> 01:24:43.511
CALIFORNIA AG AND REQUIREMENTS

01:24:43.578 --> 01:24:45.580
THAT WE IMPOSE ON THEM. ARE

01:24:45.647 --> 01:24:47.949
TREMENDOUS- THERE IS A COST TO

01:24:48.016 --> 01:24:48.983
DOING BUSINESS IN THE STATE OF

01:24:49.050 --> 01:24:51.386
CALIFORNIA. THAT SOMETIMES- IN

01:24:51.453 --> 01:24:53.288
MY OPINION IS REALLY REALLY

01:24:53.354 --> 01:24:53.988
EGREGIOUS AND QUITE FRANKLY

01:24:54.055 --> 01:24:56.391
AGGRESSIVE. WE HAVE NOT ALWAYS

01:24:56.458 --> 01:24:59.627
BEEN. KIND AS A BODY- TO THE AG

01:24:59.694 --> 01:25:01.062
COMMUNITY HAS RELATE TO SOME OF

01:25:01.129 --> 01:25:02.964
THE LAWS THAT WE DO PASS. SO I

01:25:03.031 --> 01:25:04.332
AM INCREDIBLY ENCOURAGED THAT

01:25:04.399 --> 01:25:05.567
WE ARE FOCUSED ON THE

01:25:05.633 --> 01:25:07.569
CALIFORNIA FARMERS NOW. AND

01:25:07.635 --> 01:25:09.838
I'VE SPOKEN TO SOME OF OUR

01:25:09.904 --> 01:25:11.439
LARGER PRODUCERS IN. THERE

01:25:11.506 --> 01:25:12.740
ISN'T AN IDEA THAT WE COULD

01:25:12.807 --> 01:25:13.908
HELP PRODUCT SHORTAGES AT

01:25:13.975 --> 01:25:15.376
CERTAIN TIMES OF THE YEAR AND

01:25:15.443 --> 01:25:16.578
THEY THEY BRING INTO THE IMPORT

01:25:16.644 --> 01:25:19.481
OF PRODUCTS- IN FROM MEXICO. A

01:25:19.547 --> 01:25:21.783
LOT OF THE LARGER ONES. ALREADY

01:25:21.850 --> 01:25:22.817
THE FALL UNDER THE SAME

01:25:22.884 --> 01:25:23.885
GUIDELINES I MEAN THEY THEY

01:25:23.952 --> 01:25:25.487
THEY MEET THE STANDARDS FROM

01:25:25.553 --> 01:25:26.454
CALIFORNIA TO BRING THOSE

01:25:26.521 --> 01:25:29.057
PRODUCTS AND SO. I GUESS WE

01:25:29.123 --> 01:25:30.825
COUPLE QUESTIONS. AT WHAT POINT

01:25:30.892 --> 01:25:31.860
DOWN THE LINE DO WE CONFIRM

01:25:31.926 --> 01:25:33.661
THAT AND IS THERE ANY LIABILITY

01:25:33.728 --> 01:25:34.796
ON THE DISC- LIKE TO

01:25:34.863 --> 01:25:36.264
DISTRIBUTORS BECAUSE A LOT OF

01:25:36.331 --> 01:25:37.665
PRODUCE GOES THROUGH THIS NEW.

01:25:37.732 --> 01:25:39.367
DISTRIBUTION CENTERS- BEFORE IT

01:25:39.434 --> 01:25:41.236
GETS TO THE STORE. SO WE

01:25:41.302 --> 01:25:42.871
THOUGHT ABOUT THAT. AND THEN

01:25:42.937 --> 01:25:44.305
ALSO THERE'S A TERMINATE HER

01:25:44.372 --> 01:25:46.207
TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME- COLD

01:25:46.274 --> 01:25:47.609
KENNY SECTORS WHICH ARE SOME OF

01:25:47.675 --> 01:25:49.911
THE SMALL PRODUCERS. THAT MAY

01:25:49.978 --> 01:25:52.146
BE AN ETHNIC STORE. A MOM AND

01:25:52.213 --> 01:25:54.182
POP GROCERY STORE MIGHT BUY

01:25:54.249 --> 01:25:56.217
FROM A LOCAL GROWER THAT'S VERY

01:25:56.284 --> 01:25:59.554
LOCALIZED- MAYBE IT'S A FAMILY

01:25:59.621 --> 01:26:01.422
OWNED BUSINESS. WHAT ARE WE

01:26:01.489 --> 01:26:02.590
DOING TO THEM WILL THAT LITTLE

01:26:02.657 --> 01:26:04.259
MOM AND POP BE LIABLE AT THAT

01:26:04.325 --> 01:26:06.394
POINT- BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE

01:26:06.461 --> 01:26:07.695
THE DOCUMENTATION MAYBE IT'S

01:26:07.762 --> 01:26:08.296
JUST LIKE SAID A FAMILY OWNED

01:26:08.363 --> 01:26:10.265
SMALL OPERATION. SO I

01:26:10.331 --> 01:26:13.601
ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT THIS-

01:26:13.668 --> 01:26:15.069
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A HUGE

01:26:15.136 --> 01:26:16.404
STEP FORWARD IN PROTECTING

01:26:16.471 --> 01:26:18.540
CALIFORNIA ACT. I DO THINK

01:26:18.606 --> 01:26:19.574
THERE'S A FEW THINGS WE DO NEED

01:26:19.641 --> 01:26:21.376
TO FLUSH OUT AND SO ONE IS THAT%

01:26:21.442 --> 01:26:22.277
THE LIABILITY ON THE

01:26:22.343 --> 01:26:24.112
DISTRIBUTION CENTERS. OR THE

01:26:24.178 --> 01:26:25.847
ART ON THE RETAILERS AND THEN

01:26:25.914 --> 01:26:26.948
ON THE MOM AND POP SOME OF THE

01:26:27.015 --> 01:26:29.817
SMALLER PRODUCERS- I DON'T WANT

01:26:29.884 --> 01:26:32.754
TO SEE. A STATE AGENCY.

01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:36.758
IMPOSING FINES AND FEES ON OUR

01:26:36.824 --> 01:26:38.293
COMMUNITY BASED ON BUSINESSES.

01:26:38.359 --> 01:26:40.395
THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS- I

01:26:40.461 --> 01:26:41.896

QUESTIONS THAT YOU POLLS- WILL

01:26:43.731 --> 01:26:46.200
GOING TO HAVE TO WORK ON THAT-

01:26:46.267 --> 01:26:48.069

ADDRESS YOUR CONCERNS. RIGHT I

01:26:53.441 --> 01:26:55.743
WILL TELL YOU THAT- I THINK WE

01:26:55.810 --> 01:26:57.612
CAN ALL AGREE THAT PROTECTING

01:26:57.679 --> 01:26:58.446
THE ENVIRONMENT IS A GOOD

01:26:58.513 --> 01:27:01.549
THING- HAVING LIVING WAGES FOR

01:27:01.616 --> 01:27:03.084

01:27:07.789 --> 01:27:10.792
THING. AND MANY OF US HERE WILL

01:27:10.858 --> 01:27:11.960
WILL ARGUE THAT THAT'S WHY WE

01:27:12.026 --> 01:27:15.063
PASSED. THE POLICIES THAT WE DO.

01:27:15.129 --> 01:27:17.899
ON THE FLIP SIDE IS THAT- WE

01:27:17.966 --> 01:27:20.201
DON'T IMPOSE ALL SAYING. YOU

01:27:20.268 --> 01:27:22.870

01:27:22.937 --> 01:27:25.373
ERA OCCURRING IN CALIFORNIA IN

01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:27.141
THIS CASE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:27:27.208 --> 01:27:29.010
THE FRESH FOODS. AND GOODS THAT

01:27:29.077 --> 01:27:31.913
ARE SOLD HERE. AND IN THE

01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:33.548
INTEREST OF PROTECTING

01:27:33.615 --> 01:27:36.517
CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS- WE

01:27:36.584 --> 01:27:38.453
BELIEVE THAT BY DOING THIS. OUT

01:27:38.519 --> 01:27:39.988
WE RAISE THE BAR ALL THE WAY

01:27:40.054 --> 01:27:41.222
ACROSS THE BOARD AND WE

01:27:41.289 --> 01:27:43.691
CONTINUE. TO SEE A ROBUST

01:27:43.758 --> 01:27:45.627
AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY IN

CALIFORNIA. FOR ME I SEE THE

01:27:48.262 --> 01:27:49.731
DIRECT CONNECTION TO THE WORK

01:27:49.797 --> 01:27:50.865
THAT I DO IN THE ENVIRONMENT

01:27:50.932 --> 01:27:52.600
SPACE. AND I AND I SEE THE

01:27:52.667 --> 01:27:54.369
DIRECT CONNECTION THAT HAS TO

01:27:54.435 --> 01:27:56.037
THE CONSTITUENTS THAT. I AND

01:27:56.104 --> 01:27:59.741
MANY OF YOU SERVE. IN AG

COMMUNITIES ARE ARE FARMWORKERS

01:28:00.775 --> 01:28:03.611
BY. US SO- I APPRECIATE THAT

01:28:03.678 --> 01:28:04.779
THE QUESTIONS WE WILL LOOK AT

01:28:04.846 --> 01:28:07.615
THAT- AND MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN

01:28:07.682 --> 01:28:09.617
GET SOME. OF PROTECTIONS ARE

01:28:09.684 --> 01:28:11.019
RESPONSES TO THE CONCERNS THAT

01:28:11.085 --> 01:28:12.520
YOU RAISE BUT JUST WANTED TO

01:28:12.587 --> 01:28:14.822
REINFORCE THE POINT. ABOUT WHY

01:28:14.889 --> 01:28:16.991
THIS IS IMPORTANT. TO US NO AND

01:28:17.058 --> 01:28:18.259
I CAN CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT

01:28:18.326 --> 01:28:19.394
AND I WOULD JUST LIKE ENCOURAGE

01:28:19.460 --> 01:28:20.962
ALL OF US LIKE. AS WE MOVE

01:28:21.029 --> 01:28:22.163
FORWARD AND I SAID ON LABOR

01:28:22.230 --> 01:28:24.198
COMMITTEES WELL. AND THERE'S A

01:28:24.265 --> 01:28:26.601
LOT OF BILLS THAT. COULD SEEM

01:28:26.668 --> 01:28:28.369
VERY GOOD THERE IS A COST TO

01:28:28.436 --> 01:28:30.004
THAT. SO HAS REMOVING THIS

01:28:30.071 --> 01:28:31.272
THING FOR MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT

01:28:31.339 --> 01:28:33.574
THIS LIKE THIS IS GOING TO BE.

01:28:33.641 --> 01:28:34.175
A COST INCREASE TO THE

01:28:34.242 --> 01:28:36.411
CONSUMER. I CANNOT STE WE'VE

01:28:36.477 --> 01:28:37.812
TALKED ABOUT THAT. TO DO

01:28:37.879 --> 01:28:39.213
BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA THERE IS

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:40.381
AN EXPENSE TO THAT THAT IS

01:28:40.448 --> 01:28:41.449
GOING TO BE PASSED ON THE LINE

02:24:10.675 --> 02:24:11.643
MARGINALIZED PEOPLE ARE

02:24:11.709 --> 02:24:14.112
DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY

02:24:14.178 --> 02:24:17.148
ANIMAL AGRICULTURE IS TWO FOLD

02:24:17.215 --> 02:24:19.117
ONE IS THAT I DON'T- I DON'T

02:24:19.183 --> 02:24:20.885
KNOW I WANT TO I WANT TO ANSWER

02:24:20.952 --> 02:24:25.323
ON WHY CLOSE THE FUND OKAY. FOR

02:24:25.390 --> 02:24:28.159
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. I

02:24:28.226 --> 02:24:30.261
OKAY THANK YOU I DO NOT OPPOSE

02:24:30.328 --> 02:24:31.996
FUNDING TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE

02:24:32.063 --> 02:24:34.999
GAS EMISSIONS BUT I- SEE THAT

02:24:35.066 --> 02:24:36.868
THERE IS AN ANIMAL AGRICULTURE

02:24:36.934 --> 02:24:38.436
IS AN INDUSTRY THAT ALREADY HAS

02:24:38.503 --> 02:24:40.071
LARGE SUBSIDIES. AND THOSE

02:24:40.138 --> 02:24:41.939
SUBSIDIES ARTIFICIALLY LOWER

02:24:42.006 --> 02:24:44.075
THE PRICE SO THAT THOSE TACOS

02:24:44.142 --> 02:24:45.410
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CAN BE AS

02:24:45.476 --> 02:24:46.944
CHEAP AS THEY ARE IF THE

02:24:47.011 --> 02:24:48.913
SUBSIDIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY

02:24:48.980 --> 02:24:51.049
EXISTING WERE TAKEN AWAY. THEN

02:24:51.115 --> 02:24:52.650
PEOPLE WOULD BE ABLE TO AFFORD

02:24:52.717 --> 02:24:53.885
THE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES MORE

02:24:53.951 --> 02:24:55.653
EASILY I LOVED IT AN EARLIER

02:24:55.720 --> 02:24:57.955
BILL IS SUPPORTING FRUITS AND

02:24:58.022 --> 02:24:59.724
VEGETABLES. THE PRICE IS NOT

02:24:59.791 --> 02:25:03.594
PART OF THE LOOKED TOWARD AND

02:25:03.661 --> 02:25:05.763
THE OTHER PART OF IT. GLAZER

02:25:05.830 --> 02:25:10.068
pEXPENSIVE THAN HAMBURG. SO

02:25:10.134 --> 02:25:11.702
RIGHT I KNOW BECAUSE SUBSIDIES

02:25:11.769 --> 02:25:13.971
ARE NOT THAT'S THE PROBLEM

02:25:14.038 --> 02:25:14.872
THAT'S EXACTLY THAT'S WHY I'M

02:25:14.939 --> 02:25:16.307
SAYING THAT IF YOU IF YOU

02:25:16.374 --> 02:25:17.475
ACTUALLY HAD TO BUY THAT

02:25:17.542 --> 02:25:19.844
HAMBURGER FOR WHAT IT COST TO

02:25:19.911 --> 02:25:22.680

02:25:22.747 --> 02:25:24.348

02:25:24.415 --> 02:25:25.416
WITH THE CLIMATE ISSUES TO DEAL

02:25:25.483 --> 02:25:26.751
WITH THE HEALTH ISSUES IT WILL

02:25:26.818 --> 02:25:28.619
COST FOURTEEN DOLLARS PER FROM

02:25:28.686 --> 02:25:30.254
NEED AN ONYX CAN I. ASK YOU

02:25:30.321 --> 02:25:32.356

AFTER OUR MY IF YOU'RE GONNA

02:25:58.916 --> 02:26:00.084
ASK FOR MY OPINION RESPECTFULLY

02:26:00.151 --> 02:26:01.719
PLEASE LET ME FINISH BECAUSE I

MELANIE FETISH IT'S- K. PLEASE

WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE RIGHT

02:26:13.664 --> 02:26:16.534
YOU CAN TYPE SO YES THERE. ARE

02:26:16.601 --> 02:26:22.039
I CLICK MY- I MY JOB AS A

02:26:22.106 --> 02:26:25.409
MINISTER MY PAID JOB. BECAUSE

02:26:25.476 --> 02:26:26.477
OF HOW MUCH THEY CARE ABOUT THE

02:26:26.544 --> 02:26:29.013
CLIMATE CRISIS AND I WANT YOUR

02:26:29.080 --> 02:26:32.049
CHILDREN AND MINE TOP- WHERE WE

02:26:32.116 --> 02:26:35.052
CAN LIVE. JUDY AND SO YES I

02:26:35.119 --> 02:26:38.289
CARE ABOUT REDUCING EMISSIONS.

02:26:38.356 --> 02:26:40.291
BUT THE WAY TO REDUCE EMISSIONS

02:26:40.358 --> 02:26:42.360
IS NOT TO SUBSIDIZE AN INDUSTRY

02:26:42.426 --> 02:26:44.662
THAT IS CREATING A MISSION IT

02:26:44.729 --> 02:26:48.065
IS TO INVITE THAT THAT INDUSTRY

02:26:48.132 --> 02:26:50.368
TO TRANSFORM AS VICTORIA WAS

02:26:50.434 --> 02:26:52.603
MENTIONING IN THE UK THERE NOW

02:26:52.670 --> 02:26:54.438
INSTEAD OF SUBSIDIZING THE

02:26:54.505 --> 02:26:55.973
PRODUCTION OF ANIMAL PRODUCTS

02:26:56.040 --> 02:26:57.842
OR OTHER FARM PRODUCTS THEY ARE

02:26:57.909 --> 02:27:00.478
SUBSIDIZING. SEQUESTRATION OF

02:27:00.545 --> 02:27:03.214
CARBON AND THIS BILL IS FLAWED

02:27:03.281 --> 02:27:04.549
BECAUSE IT GIVES AN INDUSTRY

02:27:04.615 --> 02:27:06.250
ANOTHER HAND OUT AN INDUSTRY

02:27:06.317 --> 02:27:08.386
THAT DOESN'T NEED IT THAT IS

02:27:08.452 --> 02:27:10.321
THAT IS THE BUT LEAVE IT THERE

02:27:10.388 --> 02:27:11.722
ARE THERE ARE NINE PLANETARY

02:27:11.789 --> 02:27:13.925
DOWNTOWN GREASE FIVE OF WHICH

02:27:13.991 --> 02:27:15.326
WE HAVE ALREADY CROSSED INTO

02:27:15.393 --> 02:27:17.328
UNSAFE OR POTENTIALLY UNSAFE

02:27:17.395 --> 02:27:19.163
TERRITORY IN ANIMAL AGRICULTURE

02:27:19.230 --> 02:27:20.565
IS THE LEAD AND FOUR OF THOSE

02:27:20.631 --> 02:27:22.967
INCLUDING THE CLIMATE CRISIS.

02:27:23.034 --> 02:27:24.669

02:27:24.735 --> 02:27:26.137
PRETENDING THAT THIS ACT AND

02:27:26.204 --> 02:27:28.806
THAT THIS INDUSTRY- CAN

02:27:28.873 --> 02:27:30.975
CONTINUE AT THE RATE THAT IT IS

02:27:31.042 --> 02:27:33.010
WE NEED TO CHANGE YOUR DIET THE

02:27:33.077 --> 02:27:35.446
SCIENCE IS VERY CLEAR WE NEED

02:27:35.513 --> 02:27:37.148
TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF ANIMALS

02:27:37.215 --> 02:27:39.350
THAT WE RAISE FOR FOOD I DON'T

AS A SMALL FAMILY TECH COMPANY.

02:31:08.559 --> 02:31:09.627
FOR SOME REASON THEY DON'T HAVE

02:31:09.693 --> 02:31:10.828
TO APOLOGIZE FOR BEING

02:31:10.895 --> 02:31:12.863

HAD HERE A FEW MINUTES AGO.

02:31:19.303 --> 02:31:21.172
IMAGINE A BILL THAT SAID IF YOU

02:31:21.238 --> 02:31:23.040
DON'T. FOLLOW OUR LABOR

02:31:23.107 --> 02:31:24.308

DOING THAT ANYTIME SOON. ALL

02:31:30.514 --> 02:31:34.752
PROBABLY NOT. AND THAT BRINGS

02:31:34.819 --> 02:31:38.289
ME TO YOUR BILL. WHICH AGAIN I

02:31:38.355 --> 02:31:39.957

THE SELF. BUT WE LIVE IN A

02:31:47.965 --> 02:31:50.634
STATE. WHERE WE SUFFER FROM

02:31:50.701 --> 02:31:52.536
DROUGHTS AND FLOODS. IN THE

02:31:52.603 --> 02:31:55.706
SAME YEAR. WHATEVER YOU THINK

02:31:55.773 --> 02:31:57.541
ABOUT THAT FOR A MINUTE HOW DO

02:31:57.608 --> 02:31:58.142
YOU SUFFER FROM A DROUGHT IN

THE FLOOD. IN THE SAME YEAR.

02:32:02.179 --> 02:32:05.015
WHY AM AN IDEA. THIS BECAUSE

WE'VE BUILT. SO LITTLE WATER

02:32:09.253 --> 02:32:10.154

HAVE FROM THE RIVERS OVER NOT

02:32:31.375 --> 02:32:32.943
GOING TO BUILD A DAM. BUT WE'RE

02:32:33.010 --> 02:32:34.845
GOING TO CONTINUE TO EXPECT THE

02:33:00.971 --> 02:33:01.672
AS I SEE HERE THIS MORNING I

02:33:01.739 --> 02:33:04.708
THINK BACK TO WHEN I WAS FAIRLY

02:33:04.775 --> 02:33:07.177
NEW AROUND HERE. IT WAS MY

02:33:07.244 --> 02:33:09.079
SECOND TERM WE DID THE WATER

02:33:09.146 --> 02:33:10.848

HERE YET MISTER CHAIRMAN-

02:33:12.983 --> 02:33:15.319
ALTHOUGH WE WISH WE'D HAD YOU

02:33:15.386 --> 02:33:17.388

02:33:17.454 --> 02:33:19.590
NEGOTIATED AN AGREEMENT WITH

02:33:19.657 --> 02:33:21.225
THAT THEN THE A GENTLEMAN WHO

02:33:21.292 --> 02:33:21.825

02:33:21.892 --> 02:33:23.627

02:33:28.899 --> 02:33:31.035
AUTHOR. WITH THE GOVERNOR WITH

02:33:31.101 --> 02:33:33.437
THE SENATE THAT WE'RE GONNA

02:33:33.504 --> 02:33:34.038
SPEND THREE BILLION DOLLARS A

02:33:34.104 --> 02:33:37.074
WATER STORAGE. NAMELY TO GET

02:33:37.141 --> 02:33:38.576
TWO MAJOR STORAGE PROJECTS

02:33:38.642 --> 02:33:39.577
SITES RESERVOIR ABOVE

02:33:44.448 --> 02:33:47.484
NEITHER OF WHICH- WELL NEITHER

02:33:47.551 --> 02:33:49.253
OF THOSE PROMISES HAVE BEEN

02:33:49.320 --> 02:33:51.355
FULFILLED RIGHT AND IN FACT. A

02:33:51.422 --> 02:33:53.390
CERTAIN INJURY WHY I APPRECIATE

02:33:53.457 --> 02:33:55.693
YOUR COMMENTS IF YOU CAN GET TO

02:33:55.759 --> 02:33:56.627

GERMINOMA I SEE. NO MY FRIEND

02:34:02.366 --> 02:34:03.968
THE REST. THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE

02:34:04.034 --> 02:34:06.003
FAILED TO. ACTUALLY INVEST IN

02:34:06.070 --> 02:34:07.571
AGRICULTURE THE WAY WE SHOULD

02:34:07.638 --> 02:34:09.340

02:34:13.110 --> 02:34:15.145
ALTHOUGH ALL SAY THERE'S NOT

02:34:15.212 --> 02:34:17.848
ANY WATER STORAGE IN THIS WHICH

02:34:17.915 --> 02:34:19.483
I THINK'S A MAJOR SHORTCOMING.

02:34:19.550 --> 02:34:22.519
AND MOREOVER THERE'S NOT.

02:34:22.586 --> 02:34:24.588
SPECIFICITY AND WHAT I MEAN BY

PROMISES WERE LATER BROKEN.

02:34:39.036 --> 02:34:40.337
LACK OF SPECIFICITY LEADS

02:34:40.404 --> 02:34:41.905
OPPORTUNITY FOR BROKEN PROMISES

02:34:41.972 --> 02:34:43.073
