AND THE POSSIBILITY OF EXPANDED TERRACE ON ADDITIONAL CHINESE GOODS THREATENS OTHER ECONOMIC SECTORS. CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIANS WILL UNDOUBTEDLY FEEL AN IMPACT. ACCORDING TO A RECENT NPR ARTICLE THE EXPANSION ON TERRACE ON IMPORTED CHINESE CONSUMER GOODS IS EXPECTED TO ADD. ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR IN COSTS ON THE AVERAGE AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD THESE ARE VERY REAL COSTS TO A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES AND A LOT OF CALIFORNIANS. INDUSTRY DISPUTE WITH CHINA MAY ONLY BE THE BEGINNING AS THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION THREATENS TO SIMILARLY.

I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE -- GOT ANOTHER -- JUST CAME IN THANK YOU SOMEONE MEMBER CHOPPER JOINING US LIKE TO INTRODUCE -- SOMEONE -- HE'S GOT AN INTERESTING PERSPECTIVE ON ON ON THIS ISSUE WHEN I ASKED SPEAKER RENDON TO CREATE -- THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTERNATIONAL REGIONAL AGREEMENTS IT WAS BECAUSE WE KNEW THAT THERE WERE A LOT OF ACTIVITIES THAT -- THE CALIFORNIA CONDUCTED AROUND THE WORLD BUT THERE WAS NEVER ANY WAY TO COORDINATE THAT AND PROVIDE ANY OVERSIGHT FROM THE LEGISLATIVE PERSPECTIVE. BUT WHAT ALSO WAS TRUE IS THAT THERE WASN'T ANY WHERE IN THE ADMINISTRATION THAT COORDINATED THESE THINGS AS WELL AND GOVERNOR NEW SOME TAPPED OUT FORMER AMBASSADOR NOW LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR LENNY CAN A LOCK US. TO DO THAT PLEASE I'D LIKE TO WELCOME YOU PLEASE COME ON UP -- TO PROVIDE SOME REMARKS AND COMMENTS ABOUT THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU IS THAT THÃ NH THANK YOU SO MUCH COMMITTEE CHAIRS EGGMAN IN LEVINE. AT AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IT IS A GREAT HONOR TO BE HERE AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU TODAY. TO ADDRESS THE IMPACTS TO CALIFORNIA FROM RAPIDLY CHANGING POLICIES SURROUNDING INTERNATIONAL TRADE. I'D LIKE TO START BY NOTING THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES IN THE US CONGRESS HAVE THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION TO SET TRADE POLICY FOR THE NATION. UNDER ARTICLE ONE OF THE US CONSTITUTION. HOWEVER BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY. AND OUR INTER DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN TRADE FEDERAL TRADE POLICY IMPACTS CALIFORNIA DISPROPORTIONATELY FROM OTHER STATES. THAT'S WHY THIS HEARING IS SO IMPORTANT. BY ENTERING INTO THE PUBLIC RECORD TESTIMONY FROM EXPERTS AND STAKEHOLDERS WHO ARE HERE TODAY. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF ITS ACTIONS ON OUR STATE'S ECONOMY. AND THE CONCERNS THAT STAKEHOLDERS ARE EXPRESSING. RECENT TRADE POLICIES ANNOUNCED IN CARRIED OUT BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAVE BEEN DEEPLY DISRUPTIVE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. J. TIMMONS C. E. O. OF NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MANUFACTURERS CALLED RECENT THREATS SURROUNDING TARIFFS ON GOODS TO MEXICO. A MOLOTOV COCKTAIL A POLICY. AS A FORMER US AMBASSADOR I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT IS HIGHLY UNUSUAL TO HAVE A PROCESS FOR TRADE POLICY SHAPE THIS WAY. IT'S RECKLESS AND A RADIC. THE PUBLIC IS HEARING ABOUT PROPOSED POLICY VI&lt;c.cyan&gt; TWEETS.&lt;/c&gt; AND THE WHITE HOUSE IS USING PRESIDENTIAL POWERS TO CIRCUMVENT CONGRESS OFTEN TO CIRCUMVENT ITS OWN ADVISERS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. I'D ALSO LIKE TO SAY AT THE START THAT THERE WAS WIDE RECOGNITION THAT THE TRUMP TARIFFS ARE PRIMARILY IMPACTING. AMERICAN COMPANIES AND AMERICAN CONSUMERS MORE THAT THE COUNTRIES WHOSE GOODS ARE BEING TARGETED. I SUSPECT WE WILL BE HEARING A LOT OF TESTIMONY ABOUT THIS TODAY. I'D ALSO LIKE TO START MY PRESENTATION BY GOING OVER THE TIMELINE OF THE IMPOSITION OF TARIFFS AND RETALIATORY TARIFFS. OVER THE LAST ELEVEN MONTHS BECAUSE MOST OF THE RECENT DISRUPTION HAS COME FROM A BACK AND FORTH ESCALATION OF TARIFFS ON US AND FOREIGN GUTS. THERE ARE THREE BASIC CATEGORIES BASED ON THE LEGAL AUTHORITY BEING USED TO LEVY THEM. THE FIRST SET OF TARIFFS IMPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION ARE REFERRED TO AS TWO THIRTY TWO TERRACE. BACK IN MARCH OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE ADMINISTRATION IMPOSED 25% TARIFFS ON IMPORTED STEEL AND CLAIMING AUTHORITY UNDER SECTION TWO THIRTY TWO OF THE TRADE EXPANSION ACT OF NINETEEN SIXTY TWO ON THE GROUNDS. OF NATIONAL SECURITY. THESE TWO THIRTY TWO TERRACE RAISE THE PRICE OF ALUMINUM AND STEEL IN THE UNITED STATES AND HAD AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT ON CALIFORNIA'S CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. AND ARE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY. ACCORDING TO THE PETERSON INSTITUTE THESE TERRORISTS INCREASE THE PRICE OF STEEL IN THE U. S. BY ABOUT 10%. THAT'S ABOUT AN ELEVEN AND A HALF BILLION DOLLAR PER YEAR COST TO THE US ECONOMY. ON MAY NINETEENTH JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO AND AFTER FOURTEEN MONTHS IN PLACE THE ADMINISTRATION GAVE EXEMPTIONS TO MEXICO AND CANADA. RELIEVING SOME OF THE PRESSURE ON THE SUPPLY OF STEEL AND ALUMINUM TO THE UNITED STATES. TWO THIRTY TWO TERABYTES HAVE ALSO BEEN LEVIED AGAINST THE EUROPEAN UNION AND JAPAN. ON MAY SEVENTEENTH PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK PROCLAIM TO MOTOR VEHICLES AND RELATED PARTS IMPORTS FROM THESE COUNTRIES IN NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT. HE DIRECTED U. S. T. R. TO NEGOTIATE A RESOLUTION. THE NEXT CATEGORY OF TERRORISTS THAT ARE RELATED ARE RELATED TO SECTION THREE OH ONE OF THE US TRADE ACT OF NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR SECTION THREE OH ONE AUTHORIZES THE PRESIDENT. TO TAKE ALL APPROPRIATE ACTION TO OBTAIN THE REMOVAL OF ANY ACT POLICY OR PRACTICE OF A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT THAT IS UNJUSTIFIED ON REASONABLE OR DISCRIMINATORY. AND THAT BURDENS ARE RESTRICTS US COMMERCE. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN SECTION THREE OH ONE INVESTIGATIONS DETERMINE THAT CHINA HAD REPLETE REPEATEDLY VIOLATED FAIR TRADE PROVISIONS. INSTANCES OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THEFT FORCE JOINT VENTURES AND A FAILURE TO LIVE UP TO AGREEMENTS AND THEIR ENFORCEMENT IS WELL DOCUMENTED AND OF NEGATIVELY IMPACTED CALIFORNIA COMPANIES. WELL THERE IS WIDE RECOGNITION THAT CHINA HAS FALLEN SHORT IN MEETING ITS OBLIGATIONS ON FAIR TRADE. THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF DISAGREEMENT ABOUT THE PROCESS THE ADMINISTRATION HAS CHOSEN TO ADDRESS IT. LET ME QUICKLY GO THROUGH THE TIMELINE OF EVENTS. IN MAY OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED US PLANTS TO PROCEED WITH SECTION THREE OH ONE ACTIONS AGAINST CHINA IN RESPONSE TO THEIR VIOLATIONS. IN JULY OF LAST SUMMER THE US IMPOSE 25% TERRACE ON THIRTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF IMPORTED CHINESE GUTS. AND CHINA IMMEDIATELY RETALIATED WITH TARIFFS ON US EXPORTS IN THE SAME AMOUNT. IN AUGUST US IMPOSE THE US IMPOSED 25% TARIFFS ON AN ADDITIONAL SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS OF IMPORTED CHINESE GOODS AND CHINA IMMEDIATELY RETALIATED WITH TARIFFS ON US EXPORTS AGAIN IN THE SAME AMOUNT. IN SEPTEMBER IN RESPONSE TO CHINESE RETALIATORY TARIFFS. THE U. S. IMPOSE TARIFFS ON APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF CHINESE CUTS. INCLUDING MANY EVERY DAY CONSUMER PRODUCTS LIKE ELECTRONICS AND HOUSEWARES. CHINA AGAIN RETALIATED WITH TERRACE ON ANOTHER SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS OF AMERICAN MADE PRODUCTS. ON DECEMBER FIRST PRESIDENT TRUMP ANNOUNCED NEW NEGOTIATIONS WITH CHINA AND DECLARED THE SEPTEMBER TWENTY FOURTH TERRACE WILL REMAIN AT 10% CREATING A PARTIAL FOR PRE. IN MAY SO JUST ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO ON MAY TENTH THE PRESIDENT TWEETED THAT NEGOTIATIONS ARE MOVING TOO SLOWLY. AND THE US INCREASED TARIFFS ON TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS OF CHINESE GOODS FROM 10% 225%. ALSO ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO PRESIDENT TRUMP ANNOUNCED A SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLAR AID PACKAGE FOR U. S. FARMERS WHO'VE BEEN HURT BY THE TERRORISTS DISPUTE. IT IS TARGETED TOWARD MISSED MIDWESTERN FARMERS WHO PRODUCE CROPS LIKE CORN AND SOYBEANS NOT CROPS THAT MAKE UP THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA EXPORTS. CONGRESSMAN JIM COSTA FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY CALLED THE PACKAGE RUSHED AND POORLY PLANNED AND SET THE CALIFORNIA PRODUCTS WILL RECEIVE A DIFFERENT AND POSSIBLY REDUCED LEVEL OF AID. FINALLY ON THE ISSUE OF THREE OH ONE TERRACE THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOW PROPOSING TO LEVY TAXES ON 25%. OF 25% ON ALL GOODS IMPORTED FROM CHINA WHICH ARE NOT YET SUBJECT TO THE THREE OH ONE TERRACE. THESE ARE VALUED AND IN ADDITIONAL THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF CUTS. THREE A ONE TERRACE ON CHINESE GOODS AND THE RETALIATORY TARIFFS IMPOSED BY CHINA. ARE HAVING AN ENORMOUS IMPACT ON THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY. AGAIN I BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO HEAR A LOT ABOUT THESE IMPACTS TODAY. AS I BEGAN PREPARING THIS TESTIMONY LAST WEEK I DID NOT THINK THERE WOULD BE A THIRD CATEGORY OF TERRACE. BUT ON THURSDAY IN A TWEET PRESIDENT TRUMP ANNOUNCED HE WILL IMPOSE A 5% TARIFF. ON ALL GOODS COMING FROM MEXICO AS OF JUNE TENTH HE ADDED THAT THE RATE WILL ESCALATE BY 5% EACH MONTH UNTIL OCTOBER WHEN THEY WOULD REACH 25%. THIS PROPOSED POLICY HAS BEEN MET WITH A SWIFT REACTION FROM PRESIDENT. LOPEZ OBRADOR WHO'S CALLING FOR TALKS. MEXICAN TRADE NEGOTIATOR HAS TO SAY I DAY WARNS THAT IF TRADE TALKS FAIL. QUOTE IT WOULD MEAN A TRADE WAR. THE LEGAL JUSTIFICATION BEING USED FOR THE CURRENT ROUND A PROPOSED TARIFFS FALLS UNDER YET ANOTHER CATEGORY. IT IS THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC EMERGENCY POWERS ACT I EAT BACK. THE BASIS PARALLELS THE JUSTIFICATION FOR TWO THIRTY TWO TERRACE THAT IT IS A MATTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY. THIS TIME CONNECTED TO IMMIGRATION. GOVERNOR NEWSOME HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT THERE IS NO NATIONAL SECURITY CRISIS ON OUR BORDER. IT IS A MANUFACTURED HUMANITARIAN CRISIS THIS IS WHY THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED INVESTMENTS IN HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE FOR ASYLUM SEEKING FAMILIES. AND REDEPLOYED MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA NATIONAL GUARD FROM OUR BORDER TO HELP COMBAT THE RISK OF WILDFIRES. ACCORDING TO THE CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE NO PRESIDENT HAS USED IT PATH EVER. TO PLACE TARIFFS ON IMPORTED PRODUCTS FROM A SPECIFIC COUNTRY OR ON PRODUCTS IMPORTED TO THE UNITED STATES IN GENERAL. AS A FORMER US AMBASSADOR I AM UNAWARE OF ANY TIME IN RECENT HISTORY THAT A PRESIDENT HAS USED THE THREAT OF TERRORISTS. AGAINST A FRIENDLY NATION. TO FORCE ACTION ON A SEPARATE FOREIGN POLICY ISSUE IN THIS CASE IMMIGRATION. SENATOR CHUCK GRASSLEY A REPUBLICAN FROM IOWA SAID IN A STATEMENT YESTERDAY. QUOTE TRADE POLICY AND BORDER SECURITY ARE SEPARATE ISSUES THIS IS A MISUSE OF PRESIDENTIAL PTEROPHORIDAE AND COUNTER TO CONGRESSIONAL INTENT. THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THIS TO CALIFORNIA IS ENORMOUS. FOR A SENSE OF SCALE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF MEXICO AS A TRADING PARTNER WITH CALIFORNIA. EXPORTS TO MEXICO TOTAL THIRTY POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. THIS IS LARGER THAN THE ENTIRE BUDGET. OF FORTY ONE INDIVIDUAL STATES. IT'S ALSO WORTH MENTIONING THAT THIS POLICY APPEARS TO BE IN DIRECT CONFLICT WITH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S NEGOTIATIONS AROUND YOU SMCA THE US MEXICO AND CANADA AGREEMENT. WHICH IS AN UPDATE TO NAFTA AND FOR WHICH THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN PUSHING TO SCHEDULE A CONGRESSIONAL VOTE [inaudible] SO. WHAT DOES ALL OF THIS MEAN TO US HERE IN CALIFORNIA? THERE WAS A LONG LINE OF DISTINGUISHED EXPERTS ECONOMIST AND STAKEHOLDERS HERE TODAY TO GO INTO DETAIL. YOU WILL HEAR ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THESE POLICIES ON CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURAL SECTOR ELECTRONICS AND TEXT TECHNOLOGY EXPORTS. AND ON OUR PORTS AND LOGISTICS SECTOR BUT I'D LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT THIS AS WELL. FIRST CALIFORNIA IS DEEPLY INTEGRATED INTO THE CALIFORNIA INTO THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. AS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD THIS SHOULD COME AS NO SURPRISE. EVERY YEAR WE EXPORT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF GOODS AND IMPORT. A TOTAL OF FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF CUTS. CALIFORNIA'S TRADE INFRASTRUCTURE IS SECOND TO NONE WITH ELEVEN PORTS AND TWELVE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THIRTEEN IF WE COUNTY AWANA WHICH IS CONNECTED TO SAN DIEGO. THE LOS ANGELES THE LONG BEACH PORT COMPLEX IS THE NATION'S LARGEST CONTAINER PORT. AND ABOUT EVERY ABOUT ONE BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF GOODS COME THROUGH ITS DOORS EVERY DAY. CALIFORNIA IS NUMBER ONE IN THE COUNTRY IN EXPORTS IN AGRICULTURE MACHINERY AND ELECTRONICS AND NUMBER ONE AND GOODS AND SERVICES EXPORTS AND IMPORTS. LOGISTICS FREIGHT WHERE HOUSING AND HE COMMERCE INDUSTRIES HAVE DEVELOPED AROUND CALIFORNIA'S INTERNATIONAL TRADE. BUILDING A SCALE THAT IS UNMATCHED IN THE COUNTRY. AN ESTIMATED 20% OF ALL THE JOBS IN OUR STATE ARE DEPENDENT ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE THAT'S ABOUT FIVE POINT. FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIA JOBS SO THIS IS TRULY AN ISSUE THAT AFFECTS EVERYONE. AGAIN TODAY SPEAKERS WILL DO A DEEP DIVE INTO THE IMPACTS ON CALIFORNIA. ON THE CURRENT AT TRADE DISPUTES AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING FROM OTHER PRESENTERS BUT THERE ARE A FEW DATA POINTS I'D LIKE TO SHARE IN CLOSING. FIRST WE'VE BEEN TOLD BY OFFICIALS AT THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES AND LONG BEACH THAT THE DOLLARS DOLLAR VOLUME OF SHIPMENTS TO CHINA. DECLINED 14% DURING THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF TWENTY NINETEEN COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF WE ALSO KNOW THAT RURAL AREAS OF THE STATE ARE SUFFERING DISPROPORTIONATELY AS RURAL INDUSTRIES LIKE AGRICULTURE IN LOGISTICS HAVE SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN THE TRADE REGIME. IF FACT ON CHANGING TERRACES ALSO DISPROPORTIONATELY FELL BY CALIFORNIA SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED BUSINESSES. THEY DO NOT HAVE THE SAME RESOURCES AS LARGE COMPANIES TO SHIP THEIR SUPPLY CHAIN OR FIND NEW INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS TO FINALLY ONE SUPPLY CHAINS CHANGE IS VERY HARD TO GET THEM BACK. FOR EXAMPLE LAST YEAR CALIFORNIA WINE EXPORTS TO CHINA FELL NEARLY 25% AFTER TAXES AND TARIFFS ON WINE. ENTERING INTO CHINA FROM THE UNITED STATES REACHED NEARLY 80%. DEMAND HAS QUICKLY BEEN ABSORBED BY INCREASED EXPORTS FROM CHILE AND AUSTRALIA THAT HAVE SEEN THEIR WINE EXPORTS TO CHINA SEARCH. IT IS VERY POSSIBLE THAT WE WILL NOT SEE AN END TO THESE TRADE DISPUTES ANYTIME SOON. AND ARCH STATE WILL BE IMPACTED FOR SOME TIME. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE WITH A THREE OH ONE TERRACE ON CHINA. NOW THAT THE PROCEDURE TO TAKE ACTION ON THREE OH ONE VIOLATIONS HAS BEEN GONE. THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF CONSENSUS INCLUDING BIPARTISAN CONSENSUS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT LEAVE THE NEGOTIATING TABLE AND TELL THERE IS MEANINGFUL RESOLUTION. WITH THE LEVEL OF COMPLEXITY INVOLVED AND CHINA'S RECENT SIGNALS THAT THEY ARE NOT WILLING TO BEND ON SOME KEY PROVISIONS THIS COULD TAKE A LONG TIME. AS TO THE CURRENT SITUATION WITH MEXICO I MUST SAY IT IS DISMAYING IN MANY WAYS. MEXICO WAS A FRIEND OF THE UNITED STATES AND A VALUED PARTNER. CALIFORNIA'S COOPERATION WITH MEXICO HAS SUPPORTED A SAFE SECURE AND PROSPEROUS BORDER. OUR TRADE RELATIONSHIP HAS BROUGHT OPPORTUNITY AND PROSPERITY TO BOTH SITES. AT LEAST FOURTEEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS ARE OF LATINO HERITAGE. OUR PARTNERS IN MEXICO CAN BE ASSURED THE CALIFORNIA STANDS READY TO SPEAK OUT. AS TO THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR RELATIONSHIP AND OUR FRIENDSHIP. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TANK GOVERNOR -- YOU MADE A COUPLE POINTS THAT I WANTED TO ASK YOU TO EXPAND ON AND YOU HAVE A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE. HOW DO? HOW DO -- PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PRESIDENT XI UNDO WHAT'S BEEN DONE. WHAT WHAT WHAT IS IT THE RESOLUTION -- IN PURSUIT OF WHAT THE POLICY GOALS MIGHT BE. WELL I THINK THAT'S WHY IT WAS SO IMPORTANT TO REALLY LAY OUT THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS AND THE LEGAL REGIME THAT IS GOVERNING ALL OF THIS. BECAUSE ONCE -- THE US HAS CONCLUDED THAT THREE OH ONE VIOLATIONS HAVE OCCURRED. AND ONCE THE PRESIDENT -- BEGINS THE PROCESS TO ADDRESS THOSE VIOLATIONS. YOU CAN'T JUST GO BACK TO THE STATUS QUO YOU HAVE TO SIT DOWN AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE. AND I REALLY ADDRESS THE NATURE OF THE VIOLATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN PLAN TAKING PLACE AND THEY HAVE BEEN. VERY VERY SERIOUS -- CALIFORNIA COMPANIES FROM ONE SIDE OF THE STATE TO THE OTHER WILL TELL YOU STORIES OF TRYING TO DO BUSINESS IN CHINA AND BEING REQUIRED. TO ENTER INTO LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS WITH. GROUPS THAT THEY REALLY DON'T FEEL THEY NEED. BUT THEY'RE REQUIRED TO DO IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DO BUSINESS THERE -- THERE ARE MANY STORIES SURROUNDING -- VISA A CALIFORNIA COMPANY THAT -- HAD. GREEN LIGHT AFTER GREEN LIGHT TO BEGIN -- TO ADVANCE THEIR BUSINESS MODEL IN CHINA PARTICULARLY AROUND ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS. AND BECAUSE OF HIGH EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY ARE ABILITY TO ENSURE IN THE MARKET WAS STALLED AND I'M FRUSTRATED AND IN THE MEANTIME. I'M OTHER CHINESE COMPANIES WE CHAT FOR INSTANCE CAME IN AND YOU KNOW CAPTURE THE MARKET SHARE. SO THESE KINDS OF STORIES AND EXAMPLES ARE REPLETE OF COURSE THE THEFT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THE REQUIREMENT TO WILLINGLY HAND OVER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. THESE ARE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND AGAIN I THINK THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF AGREEMENT THAT THESE ARE PROBLEMS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. BUT NOW THAT THE SECTION THREE OH ONE PROCESSES BATON. GOING BACK TO THE STATUS QUO I'M IS JUST NOT ADVISABLE THE FEDERAL NEGOTIATORS HAVE GOT TO GO GET MEANINGFUL CHANGE. AROUND THESE PROBLEMS THAT HAVE BEEN -- ENDEMIC FOR QUITE SOME TIME. THANK YOU ARE THERE OTHER QUESTIONS -- FROM OTHER PANELISTS SOME NUMBER CHAU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUT LIKE TO START OFF BY THANKING YOU FOR BEING HERE LOOK TO THE GOVERNOR -- FOR SHARING YOUR INSIGHTS WITH AS IF I COULD FOLLOW UP ON THE CHAIRS SO REMARKED. ON WHAT CAN CALIFORNIA DUE TO HELP RECTIFY SOME OF THE SITUATION OR TO BACK FILL SOME OF THE NEEDS THAT. HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND WITH THE THE TRADE WAR. WELL -- LOOK IT'S WHY I BEGAN MY REMARKS BY REMINDING EVERYONE THAT TRADE IS THE PURVIEW OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND IT IS EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING FOR OUR STATE WHICH IF IT WERE A COUNTRY WHICH IT IS NOT BUT IF IT WERE WOULD BE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. THE ACTIONS THAT ARE BEING TAKEN BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RELATED TO TRADE. AT A HOST OF OTHER THINGS BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TRADE RIGHT NOW. OUR SERIOUSLY IMPACTING ONS IMPACTING OUR ECONOMY. AND OF CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY IS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMY WILL BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED SO THE FACT THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS MOVING FORWARD IN SUCH A CAVALIER. CHAOTIC UNPREDICTABLE WAY THAT IS HAVING CLEAR NEGATIVE EFFECTS TO CALIFORNIA. IS -- EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY KIND OF RATIONAL SENSE IT IS SELF HARM. BOB SO WHAT EXACTLY CAN WE DO ABOUT IT. FIRST OF ALL SPEAKING UP AND SPEAKING OUT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT WHICH IS WHY I REALLY -- COMMEND YOU FOR THAT FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING TODAY I BECAUSE I'VE I KNOW WHO'S IN THIS ROOM AND YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE ON THE RECORD. SOME VERY SPECIFIC VERY DETAILED -- CLEARLY AUTHENTICATED ARE RAMIFICATIONS OF AT THIS AT TRADE AND TARIFFS DISPUTE AND THAT'S CRITICAL BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO START WITH HAVING THE FAX. BOB PUT INTO THE PUBLIC RECORD AND THEN BEYOND THAT I THINK IT IS INCUMBENT UPON EVERYONE IN THE STATE BUT PARTICULARLY OUR LEADERS AND OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS. TO BE SPEAKING OUT AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY OF THE IMPACTS OF THESE POLICIES ON OUR ECONOMY. SOME RECKON. I THINK YOU AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. IT IT WITH FROM YOUR PURVIEW AS AN AMBASSADOR HAVE YOU EVER SEEN I MEAN HISTORICALLY -- SEVENTY MAKING POLICY BY TWEET IN THIS KIND OF A RADIC WITHOUT ANY SPECIFIC PLAN BUT IT SEEMS TO BE INCREDIBLY REACTIVE. AND FROM YOUR IMPRESSION OF WHAT HAS THAT PERCEPTION DONE AROUND THE WORLD AS AS OTHERS ARE THINKING ABOUT INVESTING OR NOT INVESTING WITH US. AND I GUESS THAT THE RAMIFICATIONS IF IF WE CONTINUE DOWN THIS PATH OF POLICY BY TWEETS AND AND SEEMINGLY NO PLAN BUT JUST REACTIONS. I CHAIRMAN EGGMAN I THINK THIS IS REALLY THE GREATEST SHAME WHICH IS THAT. THE AND ENVIRONMENT AT THE CLIMATE AROUND TRADE THAT'S BEING CREATED BY THIS TYPE OF PROCESS. IS HAVING A DEEPLY CHILLING OF FACT ON TRADE. AND SO EVEN BEYOND THE TARIFFS WHICH HAVE A MEASURABLE IMPACT WHEN THE CLIMATE IS DAMPENED. YOU UNNECESSARILY I HINDER I THE D. M. AT WORK HAVE I'VE COMPANIES THAT ARE TRYING TO EXPAND INTO BUSINESS -- WHEN YOU HAVE UNCERTAINTY AND UNPREDICTABILITY? COMPANIES GOT MORE CONSERVATIVE THEY PULL BACK -- IN TERMS OF SUPPLY CHAIN COUNTRIES THAT ARE AYE IMPORTING CALIFORNIA PRODUCTS ARE THINKING WELL MAYBE IT'S ONLY GOING TO GO ON FOR ANOTHER. WEEK OR ANOTHER YEAR MAYBE THIS IS GOING TO GO ON FOR A LONG TIME SO WE NEED TO LOOK TO OTHER SOURCES FOR OUR IMPORTS BECAUSE CALIFORNIA. IS NO LONGER AS RELIABLE AS A RESULT OF THIS AND PREDICTABILITY AT SO I THINK AGAIN THAT IS PROBABLY OF EVERYTHING THE MOST DAMAGING THING BECAUSE IT'S DAMAGE THAT HAS. THERE'S JUST ABSOLUTELY NO REASON WHATSOEVER OUT FOR US TO BE DOING THIS TO OURSELVES. AS A COUNTRY. I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE TO OTHER SELLERS WHO JOINED US ASSEMBLYMEMBERS AGUIAR-CURRY IN A SOME MEMBERS RIVAS THANK YOU -- I WANTED TO CONNECT WITH YOU ARE TO FOLLOW UP ON SOME POINTS THAT YOU'VE MADE PARTICULARLY NOW IS YOUR CHAIR. OF THE CALIFORNIA NATIONAL AFFAIRS AND TRADE DEVELOPMENT INTERAGENCY COMMITTEE AND ALSO THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A PARTNERSHIP WITH AN OUTSIDE ORGANIZATION FOR OUR CHINA TRADE. OFFICE. WHAT WHAT HAS THE YOU NOTE CHATTER OR OR FEEDBACK THAT YOU'VE RECEIVED ABOUT OUR PUSH TO HAVE FURTHER EXPORTS TO CHINA BEEN BEEN LIKE FROM THOSE DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND THAT TRADE OFFICE HAS THERE BEEN AN IMMEDIATE? RESPONSE FROM THEM ABOUT WHAT WHAT YOU KNOW IF THE RECEPTION THEY'RE GETTING OF THE MARKET HA BEEN CHILLED IMMEDIATELY IF THOSE TERRACE. INCREASED COSTS IN SUCH A WAY THAT THERE'S JUST NO REASON. TO EVER TRY TO GET BACK INTO THAT MARKET. SO CALIFORNIA HAS A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE BAY AREA COUNCIL WERE ACTUALLY REVIEWING THAT RELATIONSHIP RIGHT NOW -- I COULD PICK UP THE PHONE BUT I'M FAIRLY CERTAIN THAT THEIR CONCERNS ARE ARE DEEP. HI AND I DO REGULARLY SPEAK WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM THEIR AB. AS FAR AS OUR INTER AGENCY COMMITTEE ADAM. IT'S REALLY ALREADY HAD BEEN A VERY VALUABLE ADAM TOOL BECAUSE MANY YEARS AGO TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE WAS ELIMINATED. BUT THE ACTIVITY OF CALIFORNIA AROUND INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AND HAS CONTINUED SO WHICH YOU NOTED LOOKING FOR WAYS TO COORDINATE OUR ACTIVITY IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE FIND EFFICIENCIES. AND A BETTER WAY TO BE IF YOU KNOW MORE WAYS TO BE IMPACTFUL SO WE HAD OUR FIRST COMMITTEE MEETING AT JUST LAST WEEK. AND THERE ARE THREE KIND OF GENERAL AREAS THAT ARE ALREADY EMERGING WERE CALIFORNIA WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE -- ACTIVELY I IN THE I'M AT IN THAT INTERNATIONAL ROUND -- ONE IS ON CLIMATE I'M YOU KNOW WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT I MENTIONED THAT CONSTRAINTS THAT WE HAVE ON TRADE WE ALSO OF COURSE ARE CONSTRAINED WHEN IT COMES TO IMMIGRATION POLICY -- BUT IN IN I. IN CLIMATE BECAUSE I THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR I'M ACTUALLY NOW OVER THE LAST THREE GOVERNORS HAVE MADE -- REDUCTION OF EMISSIONS AT SUCH A KEY PRIORITY AND WE HAVE THESE AGGRESSIVE TWENTY FORTY FIVE GOALS. I'M THIS IS REALLY AN IMPORTANT STORY THAT WE CAN AND SHOULD TELL ON THE NATIONAL STAGE SO THAT SOMETHING THAT -- WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE VARIOUS AGENCIES FRANKLY WHETHER IT'S TRANSPORTATION OR EPA WHERE RESOURCE SAYS THERE'S A LOT OF AREA FOR COLLABORATION? AND THEN THE OTHER AREAS OF COURSE THAT RISEN TO THE TOP -- OUR TRADE I AND KOBE IS ACTUALLY IS THE STAFF OF OUR COMMITTEE -- AND AGAIN 20% OF THE JOBS IN THE STATE FIVE POINT FOUR MILLION JOBS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE SOME CONNECTION TO INTERNATIONAL TRADE. SO IT'S AN ENORMOUS PRIORITY FOR COPAYS AND THEY DON'T IT LET ME MEANT ONSITE WHO'S THE HEAD OF COPAYS SITS ON THE COMMITTEE HE'S THAT. BAD VICE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE BUT THEN THE STAFF OF GOBIZ STOPS THE COMMITTEE AS A WHOLE. AND THEN YOU KNOW I THINK THAT WE ARE SO TRULY IMPACTED BY IMMIGRATION THAT THIS IS ANOTHER PART OF THE CONVERSATION THAT WE HAVE BUT IT DOES RUN INTO SOME OF THESE. SIMILAR CONSTRAINTS. THANK YOU SEWER MATHIS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. OF LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR YOU KNOW WE WE'VE GOT OVER. YOU'VE GOT OVER A LOT OF THE NUMBERS QUITE WELL -- MY QUESTION IS IN YOU KNOW WE ALL KNOW CALIFORNIA HAS THE MOST STRINGENT. REGULATIONS IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. AND SO IS THERE ANY PLAN SÃ­ REGULATION RELIEF TO OUR INDUSTRIES DURING THIS PERIOD THAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH THIS TEAR. FOR INTEL THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- DOES ANYTHING DIFFERENT. AMERICA'S A AS YOU SAID YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S A FEDERAL ISSUE AND WE'VE GOT A LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS A STATE TO HELP OUR INDUSTRIES OUT SO IS THERE ANYTHING. THAT'S BEING LOOKED THAT ARE BEING DISCUSSED THAT WE ALL SHOULD BE AWARE OF I THINK MAYBE THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MIGHT BE ABLE TO ANSWER THAT A LITTLE BETTER THAN THAN ME BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT I THINK -- IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT INDUSTRIES ARE SUFFERING RIGHT NOW. I SUFFERING UNDER THESE TERRIBLE POLICIES OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND THE A RADIC -- WAY THAT THEY ARE GOING ABOUT. PURSUING THESE POLICIES AND LOOKING AT ANY OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO HELP BUSINESSES HERE IN THIS DIFFICULT CLIMATE I THINK IS SOMETHING THAT CERTAINLY SHOULD BE LOOKED AT GREAT THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'VE BEEN INTRODUCED SOME NUMBER RAMOS THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR CAN A LOCK IS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING YOUR INSIGHT AND YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. NEXT I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE AND WELCOME TO ECONOMICS PROFESSORS -- FROM UC DAVIS% WE'VE GOT A PROFESSOR DANIEL SUMNER PROFESSOR AND OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS AND DIRECTOR OF AGRICULTURAL ISSUES CENTER AT UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS. AND DR KATHARINE RUSS ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR DEPARTMENT ECONOMICS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS. SOLANA CHURCH YOU JUST PUSH IT OUT OF THE WAY YEAH. DOCTORS UNDER PLEASE. YES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S AN AN HONOR AND A PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOU THIS AFTERNOON AND I I I REALLY APPRECIATE LISTENING TO THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR WHO WELL I THINK PROVIDED LOTS OF INSIGHTS -- TO WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS WITH RESPECT TO TRADE. AND SHE HIGHLIGHTED ONE POINT THAT THAT I WANT TO REINFORCE AND THAT IS -- HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ACTIONS THAT ARE THAT ARE ACTUALLY HAPPENED. UP. BUT A BUT EVEN THE THE THREATS THEMSELVES HAVE CONSEQUENCES AND AND WE ALL KNOW THAT -- BUSINESSES -- THRIVE ON A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF STABILITY UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE RULES ARE AS THEY GO FORWARD. AND AND I'LL GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE WELL WHEN I TO BEGINNING OF THE NEW ADMINISTRATION. WHEN THE THREAT OF OF ELIMINATING NAFTA WAS IN THE AIR -- BUYERS OF CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS IN MEXICO LONG TERM CUSTOMERS OF CALIFORNIA COMPANIES. WHO THEY VALUE TO SUPPLIERS IMMEDIATELY GOT ON THE PHONE AND CHECKED WITH ALTERNATIVE SOURCES SO IN THE CASE OF DAIRY PRODUCTS A VERY IMPORTANT? A PRODUCT THAT WE EXPORT TO MEXICO -- THE MEXICAN BUYER SAID SORRY GUYS WE LOVE YOU BUT WE'RE CHECKING WITH. FUND TERROR IN NEW ZEALAND JUST TO SEE WHAT THEY'VE GOT FORCE THE LAST THING YOU WANT YOU WANT YOUR CUSTOMERS TO DO IS TO CHECK WITH YOUR COMPETITORS. AND IT'S THAT SORT OF INSTABILITY OR OR OR CONCERNED I THINK PERVADES ALL OF THIS AND IT'S NOT JUST. CALCULATE THE AFFECT OF A SPECIFIC TERRAFORMING PARTICULAR MARKET -- THAT THAT WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT -- HERE AT THE AGRICULTURAL ISSUES CENTER IT UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIAN THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS WE WORK. A TOGETHER WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD NAG SECRETARY ROSS AND WE HAVE DONE FOR A CLOSE TO TWENTY FIVE YEARS PUTTING TOGETHER TRADE DATA. RELEVANT FOR CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE IN HIS OF THE THE LEG TENET GOVERNOR EMPHASIZED CALIFORNIA'S NOT A SEPARATE COUNTRY WE DON'T HAVE SEPARATE TRADE DATA FOR CALIFORNIA THAT COMES FROM. THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT OF FEDERAL COMMERCE DEPARTMENT FOR EXAMPLE. SO WHAT WE DO IS TO A ON A NUMBER OF ESTIMATES APPROXIMATIONS WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE INDUSTRY. AND I'VE I'VE. LEFT WITH USE OF THREE TABLES THAT SORT OF SUMMARIZE THE PATTERN OF AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS OUT OF CALIFORNIA. AND YOU CAN REFER TO THOSE AT YOUR LEISURE THE POINT IS WE HAVE A WIDE VARIETY OF PRODUCTS WE EXPORT STARTING WITH ALMONDS PISTACHIOS DAIRY PRODUCTS. OF THE OTHER TREE NUTS WINE IS ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED THESE ARE ALL VERY IMPORTANT EXPORT ITEMS. BUT IT GOES DOWN TO TABLE GRAPES TOMATOES AND ON AND ON AND ON IT'S TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS WHICH WE HEARD AND IN THOSE -- EXPORTED TO A REALLY A NICE BROAD PORTFOLIO OF OF DESTINATIONS -- STARTING WITH CANADA'S NUMBER ONE IN THE U. YOU IN CANADA -- SORT OF BACK AND FORTH TOGETHER. BUT CHINA TOGETHER WITH HONG KONG WHICH HAVE TO BE THOUGHT OF REALLY TOGETHER A FOR AGRICULTURAL TRADE. I'LL COMING NUMBER THREE AND OF GONNA AHEAD OF JAPAN OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. SO CHINA. THE CHINA HONG KONG NEXUS IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF A DESTINATION FOR A WHOLE RANGE OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS A TREE NUTS. BUT WINE ALSO IN AND ALFALFA HAY SURPRISINGLY SO WHICH IS IS JUST A OF ALL AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE WORLD. I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT THE TRADE TURMOIL THAT WE'RE FACING IS NOT JUST CHINA AND WE'VE HEARD MEXICO MENTIONED SEVERAL TIMES ALREADY THIS AFTERNOON. BUT TURKEY IN INDIA AND OTHER MARKETS HAVE ALSO BEEN HIT WITH OUR STEEL TARIFFS WHICH WE HEARD SORT OF STARTED THIS CURRENT MASS. AND THEN THEY NATURALLY RETALIATED BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THOSE WERE INAPPROPRIATE SORTS OF TERRACE. I ALSO WONDER ROUTE REINFORCED AND I GIVE YOU A CHART THERE FOR WHICH AGRICULTURAL EXPORTER MOST CRUCIAL THAT IS WHICH OF OUR OF PRODUCTS FOR WHICH EXPORTS ARE MOST CRUCIAL. AND AND AGAIN IT'S A WIDE RANGE. FOR EVERYONE OF THOSE ITEMS -- THEY HIRE -- FARMWORKERS AND THOSE ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA ECONOMY THERE'S JUST NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. SO WHILE WE TALK ABOUT THE BUSINESSES AND WE TALK ABOUT THE EXPORT LOSSES OF COMPANIES. I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO GO BACK TO THE WORKERS. AND I'LL JUST GIVE YOU A QUICK EXAMPLE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT CHERRIES OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS BECAUSE WE HAD SOME UNUSUAL RAINS. WELL WHEN YOU LOSE PART OF A CHERRY CROP. EITHER IT'S BECAUSE OF TARIFFS OR OR OR YOU. CAN'T MARKETING YOU CAN'T SELL THEM YOU CAN'T HARVEST ON ALL THE PEOPLE THE FIRST FACE THAT VULNERABILITY LE HARD FARMWORKERS THAT FRANKLY THIS TIME OF THE YEAR SCRAMBLING TRYING TO FIND. SOME WORK. AND WHEN YOU LOSE A CROP EITHER DO AN EXPORT RESTRAINT DURING THIS LAST WEEK IT WAS WHETHER ALL I I JUST WANT TO ENCOURAGE TO REMEMBER THOSE PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE REALLY CRUCIAL TO THE STORY HERE. WE WE HEARD ABOUT THE TERRACE COMING ON LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF AND I HAVE A CHART OF ALL ON ONE PAGE -- FOR THE DOCUMENT I GAVE YOU ALL WHICH SHOWS YOU THE CROP YEAR THE MARKETING YEAR PATTERN FOR PRICES FOR WALNUTS. I'M JUST GOING TO GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE BECAUSE THAT'S ALL WE HAVE TIME FOR ALL. THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD. YEAR FOR WALNUTS AND YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS WALNUTS ARE NOW. COUPLE YEARS AGO IN TERMS OF PRICE THE WALL IT'S WILL GET SOLD YOU CAN'T THE THERE ARE THERE ARE YOU DON'T THINK OF THEM AS A PERISHABLE CROPS. BUT YOU CAN'T STORM FROM ONE YEAR TO THE NEXT SO THEY'RE GOING TO BE SOLD THE QUANTITY WILL MOVE. BUT AT MUCH LOWER PRICES BECAUSE THE MARKETS THAT THEY USED TO GO TO HAVE BEEN CLOSED. AND IF YOU GAVE US OUR TEN YEARS IF IF SOMEBODY WOULD ANNOUNCE TEN YEARS FROM NOW WE'RE GONNA DO A TERROR FROM MOVE THEN PEOPLE WOULD REARRANGE MARKETS AND THIS AND THAT. BUT BUT THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN THAT WAY THIS WAS AT HARVEST IN FACT IS WHEN THIS EASTER OF SAID AND THEY'VE CONTINUED. THE FINAL THING I WANT TO MENTION IS IS THE FORMER THIS IS PAINFUL I'M OF A WALNUT FARM WELL I I KNOW YOU'RE FROM WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE ALL THE TREES AND PULLING OUT -- I THINK YOU MAY BE VERY NEAR MY OF MY HOME A DAVIS IN FACT THE IN IN WINTERS YEAH YEAH -- WELL NOW IMAGINE BUT STATUTES -- I I THINK -- AS SOON MATHIS MENTIONED EARLIER UP A STASH OWES OR COMPLICATED CASE. SO WE WOULD HAVE SEEN THE SAME THING I PREDICT WITH WALLETS EXCEPT IT TURNS OUT IRAN HAD THE WORST PROCESS YOU CROP IN ITS HISTORY. IS THE ONLY OTHER PLACE TO COMPETE WITH CALIFORNIA THE EXPORT MARKET. SO YOU MIGHT IF YOU WERE IF YOU IF YOU DIDN'T PAY ATTENTION THESE MARKETS YOU MIGHT SAY ALL WILL THEY WEREN'T HURT. WELL IT ANYBODY IN AGRICULTURE KNOWS IF IN THE YEARS WHEN YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SOME MONEY YOU BETTER MAKE THE MONEY. BECAUSE THE NEXT YEAR YOU'RE GOING TO BE MAKING UP FOR LOSSES IN THIS IS A YEAR WHEN WE COULD HAVE HAD SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN THE SPECIAL PRICES. INSTEAD THEY'VE SORT OF BEEN STABLE. SO MAYBE SOMEBODY AT USDA IS LOOKING AT THAT AND SAYING HEY YOU GUYS AND POSSESSIONS YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY LOSSES YOU SOLD THE CROP OF COURSE THEY SOLD PROP THEY HAD TO IT'S NOT. THIS ISN'T SOYBEANS AND CORN YOU CAN'T JUST STORED FOR YEARS. SO THEY SOLD THE CROP THEY DIDN'T GET A LOWER PRICE THAN LAST YEAR BUT WHAT THEY LOST WAS THE BUT FOR THEY REALLY NEEDED TO MAKE THE HIGH. UP PRICES THIS YEAR TO MAKE UP FOR THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY WERE FACING EARLIER. LET ME OF FINISHED IN WITH JUST A THREE FINAL REMARKS WE'VE ALREADY HEARD THE ILLUSION THE USDA HAS ANNOUNCED OF SOME COMPENSATION FOR GROWERS MOSTLY ORDERED ORIENTED TOWARDS THE MIDWEST THE GRAIN -- SOYBEANS AW. THE GROWERS THAT HAVE TRADITIONALLY GOTTEN USDA SUBSIDIES WELL MOST CALIFORNIA COMMODITIES ON IN THAT CATEGORY MOST OF OUR COMMODITIES HAVE NOT TRADITIONALLY GOTTEN THE SUBSIDIES. U. S. DOT D. A. DOESN'T KNOW THE NAME AND ADDRESS OF EVERY A GROWER IN CALIFORNIA LIKE THEY WOULD FOR A CORN GROWER OR SOYBEAN GROWER. THAT MAKES IT HARDER AND IT MADE MEN'S OUR GROWERS HAVE GOTTEN MUCH LESS RELATIVE TO THE SIZE OF THEIR LOSSES. UP THERE. TO YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE IS BEEN WORKING IN WASHINGTON TRYING TO FIX THAT. AND WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT THE NEXT ROUND WILL FIX SOME OF THAT -- IN TERMS OF COMPENSATION AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE YOU FOLKS CAN ALL DO SUPPORT OF OUR INDUSTRIES IN THEIR EFFORTS IN WASHINGTON EITHER THROUGH OUR OF FEDERAL DELEGATIONS OR OR SOMEHOW. OF THE OTHER THING -- I I WANT TO SAY IS IS. THAT ARM. THE BASIC PRINCIPLE ABOUT PROSPERITY FOR INTERNATIONAL TRADE IS STABILITY AND SO ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO RE ESTABLISH THAT STABILITY I THINK IS A CRUCIAL THING AND AND I GAVE THE ILLUSTRATION OF OF INSTABILITY CREATING BY JUST. THREATENING TO DO THINGS AND THE MORE WE CAN -- GET AWAY FROM THAT OF THE BETTER. AND THE FINAL THING I'LL SAY IS NONE OF THIS -- SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD AS SAYING -- THE CHINA HAS BEEN BLAMELESS FOR EXAMPLE A NO I I'VE NEVER HEARD ANYONE SAY NO NOBODY IN BUSINESS NOT NOT. NOT THE MEMBERS OF THE OF THE ELECTED COMMUNITY SAYING ALL WHILE TRYING TO SHOULD GET A FREE RIDE THERE OKAY. BUT WHAT I WILL SAY IS WE HAVE WELL ESTABLISHED IN FACT AFFECTED INSTITUTIONS FOR DEALING WITH A PEOPLE THAT VIOLATE TRADE AGREEMENTS. IN THE W. T. O. IS INEFFECTIVE. INSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES JUST ONE TWO MAJOR TRADE CASES AGAINST CHINA THEY'LL APPEAL WILL WIN THE APPEALS. AND WE WILL BE THEN HAVE THE WHOLE WORLD BEHIND US IN BRINGING SANCTIONS AGAINST CHINA ON THOSE TWO AGRICULTURAL CASES. AND I WOULD HOPE THAT IS NOT TOO LATE. TO TAKE A STEP BACK IN USE THE OF THE INSTITUTIONS THAT WE'VE ESTABLISHED OVER THE YEARS FOR SETTLING DISPUTES NO LEGAL WAY AND THAT WAY WE WOULD HAVE NOT. THE U. S. GOING ALONE AND EVERYBODY ELSE AGAINST US BUT THE U. S. TOGETHER WITH LOTS OF OTHER COUNTRIES THAT ACTUALLY DO AGREE WITH THIS. ANA ON CONCERNS ABOUT CHINESE TRADE BETTER. LET ME STOP THERE SORRY THANK YOU SO MUCH DOCTOR SUMNER AND WILL GO TO A DOCTOR RUSS BEFORE WE THEN CRY ABOUT OUR ONE THAT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE -- AND AND TO GET GO -- A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THOSE ISSUES DOCTOR US THANK YOU. SO THANKS VERY MUCH TO THE SELECT COMMITTEE IN THE STATE STANDING COMMITTEES FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY ON THE U. S. CHINA TERROR -- FOR I'D LIKE SO I HOPE YOU CAN HEAR ME I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF US OKAY GREAT -- TO THERE ARE THREE AREAS WHERE -- I WAS ASKED TO COMMENT TODAY ON THE IMPACT OF THE TERRACE. BOB FIRST ON CONSUMERS SO AS THE TEN GOVERNOR **** **** AKIS EXPLAINS AND REALLY HELPFUL DETAIL THERE IS CURRENTLY A 25% TAX ON ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF GOODS FROM CHINA. AS THEY CROSS THE BORDER INTO THE UNITED STATES. OF FEASIBLE RANGE OF COSTS FOR THE AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD JUST FOR THE COST OF THESE TAXES NOT THE DISTORTIONS THAT THEY GENERATE. IS BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS WITH EITHER -- FIVE HUNDRED BEING A FOCAL POINT -- THAT ACTUALLY FELL INTO THE ESTIMATES OF SEVERAL STUDIES. AND THE COST OF THESE TARIFFS YOU CAN THINK OF IS SIMILAR TO A SORT OF HIDDEN SALES TAX. BETWEEN ONE HALF AND 1% -- BUT IT'S NOTSPREAD EVENLY ACROSS GOODS LIKE A SALES TAX WOULD BE SO IT TENDS TO BE MORE DISTORTION. FOR THAT REASON. NGUYEN ECONOMIST FACTOR IN THE HANG UPS INVOLVED IN CONSUMERS HAVING TO SUBSTITUTE AWAY FROM GOODS THAT THEY LIKE TOWARD GOODS THAT THEY LIKE LESS AND SOURCE FROM LESS EFFICIENT PRODUCERS WE GET THESE. DEAD WEIGHT LOSSES -- THAT THAT'S WHAT WE CALL THESE EFFICIENCY LOSSES IN PUBLIC FINANCE THOSE COULD BE TWO TO THREE TIMES JUST THE COST OF THE TAXES THEMSELVES. SO THE COST FOR THE AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD IF YOU FACTOR THOSE IN COULD BE QUITE ENORMOUS -- IN TERMS OF JOBS SO CHINA IS THE DESTINATION FOR NEARLY 10% OF CALIFORNIA'S EXPORTS -- THERE ARE MORE THAN FIFTY THREE THOUSAND JOBS AND TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED BUSINESSES LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA. THAT MAY BE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO RETALIATORY TARIFFS BY CHINA DUE TO THE FACT THAT CHINA IS THE DESTINATION FOR MORE THAN 20% OF THEIR INDUSTRIES EXPORTS TO THE WORLD SO CHINA'S A MAJOR EXPORT MARKET FOR THEIR INDUSTRIES -- TO IT SOON SO THAT'S ONE REASON WHY SOME INDUSTRIES MAYBE VULNERABLE BECAUSE CHINA'S A MAJOR MARKET. ANOTHER REASON WHY SOME INDUSTRIES MAY BE MORE VULNERABLE THAN OTHERS IS BECAUSE CHINA'S RETALIATORY TERRAFORMED THEIR GOODS IS TWENTY OR 25% INSTEAD OF 0025%. SO -- IF WE LOOK AT INDUSTRIES THAT MIGHT BE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE FOR ONE OF THESE REASONS -- THEY INCLUDE -- WOOD PRODUCTS A LOGGING AND TIMBER -- AGRICULTURE AS PROFESSOR SUMNER -- EXPLAINED IN X. JUST BEAUTIFUL DETAIL -- FISH AND MARINE PRODUCTS OIL AND GAS MINING AND QUARYING INDUSTRIAL MACHINERY AND MOTOR VEHICLE RELATED MANUFACTURING COSMETICS AND SKIN CARE AND WINE AND SPIRITS AS IS IN YOUR BACKGROUND REPORT -- THE BALANCE OF JOBS CREATED IN INDUSTRIES THAT ARE PROTECTED BY THE TERRACE BECAUSE SOME INDUSTRIES ACTUALLY ARE PROTECTED BY THE TERRACE AND BECAUSE THEY'RE ABLE TO RAISE THEIR PRICES UNDER THIS PROTECTION FROM. COMPETITORS IN CHINA OR ELSEWHERE DEPENDING ON THE TARIFF IN PLACE THEY CAN SOMETIMES EXPAND -- EMPLOYMENT BUT THE BALANCE OF JOBS CREATED IN THESE PROTECTED INDUSTRIES VERSES JOBS LOST IN CONTRACTING INDUSTRIES TENDS TO BE -- NEGATIVE IN THE ESTIMATES THAT I'VE SEEN SO FAR I HAVEN'T SEEN ESTIMATES IN PARTICULAR FOR CALIFORNIA YET BUT FOR THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE NATIONALLY -- I'VE SEEN ANYWHERE FROM A HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND TO NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND JOBS AS A NET LOSS SO BILL NET LOSS OF UNDER 552-900-1000 -- JOBS JUST FOR THE CURRENT TERRACE SO NOT FOR THE TERRACE OF THEIR EXPANDED -- TO MORE PRODUCTS. TERMS OF GDP THE TERRORISTS ARE LIKELY TO SHRINK THE SIZE OF THE US ECONOMY AND BE A HEAD WIND FOR U. S. GDP GROWTH. THE NONPARTISAN TAX FOUNDATION ESTIMATES THE CURRENT TERRACE WILL SHRINK THE OVERALL SIZE OF THE US ECONOMY OF WHICH AS YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA IS A HUGE PART. BY FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS. THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF NEW YORK LIBERTY STREET BLOG PUBLISHED ESTIMATES BASED ON ONE OF THE BEST THEY JUST TOP QUALITY ACADEMIC STUDIES ON THE TOPIC -- SUGGESTING THAT TERRORISTS COULD SHRINK THE SIZE OF THE US ECONOMY BY NINETY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS THESE ARE ONLY THE TERRACE IN PLACE RIGHT NOW. AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF THAT NINETY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS ACTUALLY CAME FROM EFFICIENCY DISTORTIONS JUST FROM THIS LAST ROUND OF THE INCREASED TARIFFS ON THE CHINESE GOODS. THAT -- THE TANK GOVERNOR COULD NOT GUESS MENTIONED ON THE TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF CHINESE IMPORTS FOR RAISING THE TERROR FROM 10225% JUST THAT. KNOCKED ON KNOCKED UP THIS ESTIMATE OF THE HIT TO THE US ECONOMY BY -- ALMOST EIGHTY BILLION DOLLARS. AT CHINA ACCOUNTS FOR ONE THIRD OF GLOBAL GROWTH. AND THIS IS -- AND CHINA IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF DEMANDS FOR A LOT OF DEVELOPING COUTRIES COMMODITY EXPORTING COUNTRIES. SO ANY SLOWING IN CHINA'S ECONOMY COULD GENERATE HAD WINS FOR U. S. G. D. P. GROWTH THROUGH ITS AFFECT ON GLOBAL GROWTH AND OUR EXPORT MARKETS ELSEWHERE [inaudible] THANK YOU. DOCTOR US THANK YOU I WANT TO INTRODUCE A CELL NUMBER BOERNER HORVATH YOU JUST JOINEDUS THANK YOU FOR COMING AND IN YOU JUST TOUCHED UPON SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DATA. COMING OUT -- DATA IS INDICATIVE OF A OF A NEAR TERM RECESSION SO THAT'S NOT TOO FAR AWAY AND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT NUMBERS THAT SHRINK JOBS AND SHRINK OUR OVERALL ECONOMY. ALL OF THAT SEEMS TO HASTEN A AT ANY ECONOMIC DOWNTURN THAT WOULD BE RECESSIONARY CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT KIND OF HOW QUICKLY THOSE NUMBERS COULD BECOME REALITY. OR ARE THEY PROJECTED HOW HOW SOON WOULD WILL WE FEEL THAT. IT'S HARD TO ESTIMATE EXACTLY WHAT THE TIMING OF THESE CONTRACTIONS WOULD BE IN PART BECAUSE OF THE TIMING ISSUE THAT LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR CARACAS AND PROFESSOR SUMNER MENTIONED. BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY SOME OF THE CONTRACTION IS ALREADY HAPPENING IN TERMS OF DAMPENING INVESTMENT -- I I CAN TELL YOU THAT -- EVEN YESTERDAY MAJOR FORECASTERS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR WERE COMING OUT KNOCKING HALF PERCENT OFF OF THEIR PREDICTIONS FOR U. S. GROWTH SHOULD THAT TERROR FOR CONTINUE OR WORSEN. OUT WE'VE ALSO SEEN DOWNWARD REVISIONS IN FORECASTED GROWTH FOR THE GLOBAL ECONOMY BY THE I AM MATH. SO. I I BELIEVE THAT WE'RE ALREADY SEEING SOME DRAG IT'S HARD TO SEE IT BECAUSE PROFESSOR SUMNER WAS TALKING ABOUT THE COUNTER FACTUAL WITH -- PISTACHIO PRICES RIGHT SO WE'VE BEEN IN A RECOVERY FOR I MEAN WE'VE BEEN IN RECOVERY -- FOR BASICALLY TEN YEARS NOW AND SO WE'VE BEEN ON THIS UPSWING AND SO IT'S IT'S HARD FOR PEOPLE TO SEE THE HEAD WINDS THAT ARE KIND OF DAMPENING. BUT THE GROWTH THAT WE MIGHT SEE WITHOUT THE UNCERTAINTY AND THE DISTORTIONS OF TARIFFS. ARE HAVING THEIR IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY. I DO AT OTHER MEMBERS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AT THIS POINT BACK TO THE ISSUE AROUND -- FARMWORKERS BOTH AS WORKERS BUT THEN ALSO ON THE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A THE DOUBLE WHAMMY RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE TO TERRACE IN ADDITION. TO THE CHAOS AT THE BORDER WHERE. AND AND EVERYTHING I'VE HEARD IS THAT YOUR BAG COMMITTEE IS ABOUT THE PROBLEM OF BEING ABLE TO FIND ENOUGH LABOR RIGHT NOW -- TO CAN YOU COMMENT ON THE THOSE TWO THINGS COMING TOGETHER AT THE SAME TIME. THERE'S CERTAINLY NO QUESTION THAT DOG GROWERS HAVE A HARD TIME FINDING WORKERS -- BUT DURING CERTAIN TIMES OF THE YEAR WHEN THEY'RE CERTAIN TASKS AND END. UP WHAT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE IS -- A FARMWORKERS A TYPICALLY HAVE A HARD TIME PUTTING TOGETHER MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FORTY HUNDRED FIFTY DAYS A YEAR OF WORK EVEN IF THEY'RE WORKING FULL TIME FIFTEEN HUNDRED HOURS IS. IS IT BECAUSE OF WINS ONE FARMERS HIRING AN AREA EVERYBODY'S HIRING IN THAT AREA AND THEN YOU FEEL THE SHORTAGE OF WORKERS IN AT THAT TIME. EVERYBODY CAN WORK. AND IT BUT IT'S IT'S ON THE EDGES OF THAT WHEN THE FARMWORKERS ARE SCRAMBLING TRYING TRYING TO GET JOBS. AND SO THESE THINGS CAN EXIST AT THE SAME TIME IT CAN BE CERTAINLY THE CASE THAT -- HERE HERE AND WINTERS CALIFORNIA THERE CERTAIN TIMES WHEN THE THE GROWERS ARE SAYING GEE I WISH I COULD FIND MORE WORKERS. A MONTH LATER THE WORKERS ARE SAYING I WISH I COULD FIND A JOB AND THAT'S THE SEASONAL NATURE OF AGRICULTURE SO -- I THINK OF BOTH OF THOSE THINGS ARE GOING ON WE DON'T KNOW THAT HIRED FARM WORKER WAGES HAVE BEEN GOING UP GRADUALLY IN CALIFORNIA FOR A WHILE. AND THAT SOMETHING THAT'S POSITIVE AND AND I THINK FOR WORKERS IN GROWERS FRANKLY EVERY DRAWER I'VE EVER TALKED TO SAID I WISH I COULD PAY HIGHER WAGES I WOULD LIKE TO PAY HIGHER WAGES. BUT THE MARKET REALITIES MAKE THAT HARD. IN HAVING THESE KIND OF TERROR OF SIN PLACE THE DAMPEN PRICES MAKE IT THAT MUCH HARDER ON THE GROWERS. AND UP SO SO I THINK IT'S IT'S IT'S TROUBLESOME THAT THESE ALL THESE ISSUES ARE THERE AT THE SAME TIME BUT I THINK WHAT I LIKE TO DO IS ALWAYS HIGHLIGHT YOU KNOW BECAUSE PEOPLE. CAN SAY ALL. SEE WE CAN TALK ABOUT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF HERE AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT A BILLION TIMES CLOSE IS FRANKLY I I CAN'T PICTURE IT. BUT IF SOMEBODY TELLS ME HERE'S A FAMILY THAT LOST HER JOB. A EVEN I CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT MEANS IT IT AND WHEN I WAS I FOUND IT COMPELLING A FEW MONTHS AGO WHEN ONE OF THE WINE GROWERS DOWN IN THE LODI AREA WAS SAYING. THEY WERE PLANNING A NEW VENUE THEY WERE REPLACING A VINEYARD AND THEY THEY YOU STILL POST WHEN THEY PLANT VINEYARDS. IN THIS PARTICULAR VINEYARD -- UP BETWEEN THE TIME THEY PLANTED TO WHEN THEY WERE GETTING READY TO DO IT THE TERRACE CAME ON FOR STEEL ALUMINUM. THE BILL THEY WERE GOING TO GET FROM THE STEEL GUY WAS FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS HIGHER WHERE I KNOW WHAT FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS LOOKS LIKE I MEAN I KNOW WHAT A BILLION LOOKS LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT. FIFTY SO HERE'S JUST A GUY IN A JUST A FAMILY AND THEY CHOSE NOT TO DO IT THEY SAID WELL MAYBE NEXT YEAR. WELL THERE WERE SOME WORKERS THE RATE TO GO. UP AND THEY COULDN'T DO IT BECAUSE OF THAT CASE IT WAS THE COST OF IMPORTS AND I REALLY LIKE THE FACT THAT THE WE WE THINK ABOUT THIS POST AS THE IMPORTS. TAXES THAT'S WHAT TERRACE ARE THE TAXES ON IMPORTS. ARE HURTING OUR ECONOMY. AND THE LACK OF EXPORT ACCESS HURTING OUR ECONOMY IT'S BOTH WAYS TRADE IS ACTUALLY. GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY AND PROFESSOR RUSS -- DID A VERY GOOD JOB OF HIGHLIGHTING THESE LOSSES AND WE COLUMN DEAD WEIGHT BECAUSE THEY'RE LIKE DRAGGING A DEAD WEIGHT FOR THE ECONOMY. AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND. SO WE'VE GOT -- SUBSIDIES THAT REALLY BOOST MIDWEST GROWERS. REALLY MISSES OUT ON CALIFORNIA GROWERS BUT NOTHING ON THE HIT TO CONSUMERS MORE BROADLY. THE LOWER INCOME. CONSUMERS OF COURSE THE WORST FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ON A FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR INCOME IS A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY FOR PEOPLE -- ON A TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR INCOME PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT LESS PAINFUL -- WHAT WHAT WHAT WILL THOSE IMPACTS BE LIKE WILL PEOPLE BE ABLE? TO ON ON THOSE KIND OF LARGER. ACCURATE DATA. SAMPLES BE ABLE TO ABSORB FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS OR WILL THIS DRAG PEOPLE FURTHER DOWN -- ECONOMICALLY PEOPLE WHO PROBABLY HAVE LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN SAVINGS IN THEIR BANK ACCOUNT CAN'T HAVE ANY ECONOMIC EMERGENCY. IN IN THEIR LIVES WITHOUT -- PERHAPS LOSING A CAR -- BECAUSE THEY CAN MAKE A CAR PAYMENT OR NOT BEING ABLE TO MAKE RENT -- OR SOME OTHER VERY HARD CHOICE WHAT ON CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT AT ALL. THERE'S AN INTERESTING STATISTIC PUT OUT -- IT JUST CAME IT JUST CAME OUT TWO WEEKS AGO I THINK IT'S A FAD STATISTIC A SURVEY OF HOW MANY HOUSEHOLDS WOULD HAVE DIFFICULTY ABSORBING A SURPRISE FOUR HUNDRED DOLLAR COST. AND IT'S NOT A SMALL FRACTION OF THE POPULATION ON THE EXACT NUMBERS ESCAPING ME RIGHT NOW BUT I THINK IT WAS ABOUT A THIRD OF HOUSEHOLDS WOULD HAVE DIFFICULTY -- COVERING A SURPRISE FOUR HUNDRED DOLLAR COST. THE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IT APPLIES TO A HOUSEHOLD MAKING ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR SO IT'S GRADUATED ACROSS SO IF YOU SPEND MORE -- INCOME THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE HIGHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS OF THE RICHEST HOUSEHOLDS MAY HAVE YOUR FIFTEEN HUNDRED TO TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS -- IN THESE EXTRA HIDDEN TAXES THAT THEY'LL BE PAYING THE REASON WHY WE SAY IT'S REGRESSIVE NONE THE LESS IT FALLS MORE HEAVILY ON LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS NONETHELESS. IS BECAUSE AS A FRACTION OF INCOME THESE HOUSEHOLDS SPEND MORE SO THEY SPEND MORE ON CONSUMPTION THEY HAVE LESS TO PUT AWAY IN SAVINGS. AND BECAUSE OF THAT JUST LIKE ANY SALES TAX IT'S REGRESSIVE. SO THAT'S WHY IT FALLS MORE HEAVILY ON PEOPLE THAT HAVE TO SPEND A HIGHER FRACTION OF THEIR INCOME. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS COLLEAGUES MISTER SHOP I COULD FOLLOW UP ON THAT POINT A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS -- PER HOUSEHOLD. CONSUMER I PRESUME MOST OF THE ITEMS BEING CONSIDER OUR CONSISTED OF A CONSUMER ITEMS -- INSTEAD OF LET'S SAY ELECTRONIC PARTS OR OTHERWISE WILL IS THAT NOT CORREC. SUE -- ACTUALLY THESE ARE BASED ON STUDY SO. TO THE BOTTOM THE BOTTOM -- OF THE RANGE THAT I GAVE YOU THREE HUNDRED EIGHT HUNDRED THAT'S JUST A SIMPLE OKAY OUR GOODS FROM CHINA ARE ABOUT 2% OF CONSUMPTION AND INCREASE THE COST OF THOSE BY HUNDRED DOLLARS RIGHT SO THAT'S REALLY BACK OF THE ENVELOPE IF YOU. ONLY LOOK STRICTLY AT FINAL GOODS. THESE OTHER STUDIES -- THE MORE IN DEPTH ONES NOT BACK OF THE ENVELOPE HAVE ACTUALLY TRACED ALSO THE TAXES ON IMPORTED IMPORTS FROM CHINA SO FACTORS THAT FIRMS IN THE U. S. USING PRODUCTION OF FINAL GOODS THAT EVENTUALLY ARE PURCHASED BY U. S. CONSUMERS. AND THEN WHEN YOU DO THAT YOU SEE THAT ACTUALLY THE COSTS OF TERROR OF SIR ARE PROBABLY QUITE A BIT HIGHER THAN THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS -- FOR THE AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD. ALRIGHT SO WITHOUT ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO BOTH OF YOU FOR PROVIDING SOME INSIGHT ON HOW THESE TERRACE FOR AFFECTING CALIFORNIA ECONOMICALLY. RIGHT NEXT I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME TO THE NEXT PANEL MATT DAVIS A DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS FOR THE PORT OF OAKLAND. RACHEL MICHELIN THE PRESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA RETAILERS. COURTNEY JENSEN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF TECH NOW. I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH CHAIRS FOR EVERYBODY SO JUST TAKE THESE FOR AND THEN WILL SAVE -- I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT CORDY WOULD YOU MIND MISTER ANSWERED IF WE SAVE YOU FOR THE NEXT ONE TO HAVE A THREE AND THREE THAT MAKES SENSE I THINK ANIMAL. WE'LL FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THE Q. AND A ON ALL OF THOSE THE LOAD I DIDN'T YOU ST CENTURY SOMEONE ELSE YOU JUMPED IN THERE EARLIER BUT WILL TAKE YOU -- WE GOT DAVE WHO WE HAD EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF WESTERN GROWERS ASSOCIATION SO WILL SAVE THE PAST -- FOR AFTER YOU DAVE. THE OTHER TWO WERE ARE FANTASTIC NO YOU'RE ALL GREAT REALLY WANT TO SAY THANK YOU. FOR JOINING US ON THIS THESE ARE REALLY DIFFICULT ISSUES THERE AFFECTING YOUR MEMBERS IN VERY SERIOUS WAYS AND YOU ARE LEADERS OF EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT -- TRADE ASSOCIATION OUR MEMBER ASSOCIATIONS THAT REPRESENT GROUPS IMPACTED BY THIS TRADE SO I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR THAT IT WILL GO AS I BEGAN TO DO THE INSTRUCTIONS WITH THAT MISTER MISTER DAVIS FROM THE PORT OF OAKLAND THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO THE CHAIRS AND THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MATT DAVIS AND AS YOU SAID I'M THE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS THE PORT OF OAKLAND -- I'M HERE ON BEHALF ACTUALLY ON THE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SITUATION FOR THE FORTIES WHICH COMPRISES THE ELEVEN PUBLIC PORT COMMERCIALS -- COMMERCIAL PORTS HERE IN THE STATE IF YOU'VE HEARD INTERNATIONAL TRADE IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF OUR STATE'S ECONOMY. AND OUR PORTS ARE VITAL PARTNERS IN FACILITATING GROWTH IN THE SECTOR. CALIFORNIA'S HOME TO THE MOST PRODUCTIVE SYSTEM OF PORTS THE NATION INCLUDING THREE OF AMERICA'S LARGEST CONTAINER PORTS AND A VERSUS SOME OF SPECIALTY PORTS THAT TOGETHER HANDLE NEARLY 40%. OF ALL THE CONTAINERIZED CARGO THAT ENTERS THE US AND ALMOST A THIRD OF THE NATION'S EXPORTS. FOR ANYONE INVOLVED IN THE BUSINESS OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND INVOLVED IN MAKING PLANS FOR LONG TERM CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. THESE LAST TWO YEARS HAVE BEEN VERY CHALLENGING TO SAY THE LEAST INCLUDING ALL OF OUR PARTNERS THAT SHIP GOODS TO OUR PORTS. THE TERRACE INITIATED BY -- THE U. S. IN THE RETALIATORY ACTIONS BY CHINA AND OTHER TRADING PARTNERS HAVE EXPOSED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CARGO TO HIGHER COSTS AND THREATEN THEIR COMPETITIVENESS. THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES FOR EXAMPLE RELIES ON CHINA FOR ABOUT 60% OF ITS TOTAL TRADE VOLUMES IN OAKLAND. IN WHERE WE WE HAVE A RELATIVE FIFTY FIFTY BALANCE OF IMPORT AND EXPORT TRADE CHINA STILL REPRESENTS OVER A THIRD OF THE GOOD TO MOVE THERE ARE PORTS INCLUDING MANY ACT GOODS. THE CURRENT TERRACE THAT HAVE BEEN INITIATED BY THE U. S. ALONE OF EXPOSED APPROXIMATELY OF CONTAINERIZED CARGO IMPORTED THROUGH OUR PORTS WHICH HAS OVER SIXTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN TRADE VALUE. THE NEXT ROUND OF TARIFFS THREATEN NEARLY IN THAT THE ENTIRE TRADE LANDSCAPE WITH CHINA. IN TERMS OF DIRECT IMPACTS TO CARGO FLOWS THE SHORT TERM IMPACT OF THE TRADE WARS. IRONICALLY BEEN A GROWTH IN CONTAINERIZED IMPORTS FROM CHINA. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF THIS YEAR CARGO VOLUMES CONTAINERIZED CARGO VOLUMES ACTUALLY GREW. AS SHIPPERS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO FRONT LOAD THEIR INVENTORIES TO AVOID THE THEN PENDING IMPOSITION OF TARIFFS. THIS IS NOT A TREND THAT IS LONG TERM AND SHORT TERM IN NATURE AND IT'S NOT THIS IS A NOBLE TYPE OF GROWTH THE VIEW THAT WE ACTUALLY WELCOME. WHERE HOUSING CENTERS ARE STARTING TO TO FILL TO THE MAX AND WE'VE HEARD THAT THERE'S LESS THAN A 1% -- VACANCY RATES IN MANY OF THE WAREHOUSING CENTERS AND THE ST PETER AREA. IN SOME CASES -- THE SURGEON IMPORT TRADE IS ALSO BECAUSE CONGESTION AT PORT FACILITIES AMONG THE SUPPLY CHAIN. AND ITS RIPPLE THROUGH AND HAD IMPACTS WORSHIPPERS AND GROWERS ARE NOT ABLE TO GET THEIR GOODS TO OR FROM THE PORTS IN TIME. ON THE OUTBOUND SIDE -- WE'VE SEEN EXPORT TOTALS CONTINUE TO SUFFER DUE TO THE COUNTERVAILING DUTIES IN THE TERRACE -- COLLECTIVELY CALIFORNIA PORT SIDE DECREASE OF BETWEEN 2230% IN OUR TOTALS THAT WE'VE SENT TO CHINA A GROWTH AN EMPTY BOXES WHICH WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN A SPIKE IS NOT A WAY TO HELP OUR ECONOMY. YOU'LL HEAR FROM THE PARTNERS ARE SUPPLY CHAIN ABOUT SPECIFIC IMPACTS OF THE SECTORS BUT THE NEGATIVE LONG TERM IMPACTS THESE TERRACE ON AG PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED GOODS HOUSEHOLD ITEMS AND RETAIL IS REAL. AND TO THE EXTENT AS YOU ALSO HEARD FROM FROM OUR FIND -- ECONOMIST SPOKE EARLIER TO THE EXTENT THE OTHER COUNTRIES ARE STEPPING IN TO PROVIDE THESE GOODS TO CHINA INSTEAD OF OUR GROWERS IN OUR MANUFACTURES -- MEANS THAT WE'RE LOSING OUT ON IN A LONG TERM ACCESS TO THE LARGEST CONSUMER MARKET SURELY ONE OF THE LARGE CONSUMER MARKETS IN THE WORLD. SO THE LONG TERM POTENTIAL REDUCTION TRADE VOLUME HAS A CORRESPONDING A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE HEALTH OF THE ENTIRE GOODS MOVING TO CONNIE. INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO CAPITALIZE ON OUR FUTURE SUSTAINABLE GROWTH INNOVATIONS IN LEADERSHIP WHICH WITH WHICH WE CERTAINLY DEMONSTRATED FOR MANY YEARS. THAT WE CAN THAT WE CAN BE -- AN EXAMPLE OF A GREAT THINGS HAPPENING HERE IN THE STATE. AND SO WHILE THE STATE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DIRECTLY AND DO THESE FEDERAL LEVEL WE WOULD CERTAINLY ASK THE CONTINUED COMPETITIVENESS OF THE INTERNATIONAL GOODS MMHM SECTOR BE CONSIDERED EVEN MORE STRONGLY. AND WHAT OF THE HEAD WINDS I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY AND HAPPY ANSWERING QUESTIONS. MISTER DAVIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH MS MICHELIN PLEASE THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS I'M RACHEL MICHELIN. AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION I'M OUR MISSION IS TO PRESERVE AND ENHANCE THE RETAIL INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA WE PROTECT THE INDUSTRY BY TAKING A SIGNIFICANT LEADERSHIP POSITION. AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF PUBLIC POLICY AND REGULATORY MEASURES THAT IMPACT OUR MEMBERS IN THE BUSINESS CLIMATE IN THE STATE. THE CALIFORNIA RETAIL INDUSTRY CURRENTLY OPERATES IN OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND RETAIL ESTABLISHMENTS WITH THE GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT OF THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY BILLION ANNUALLY. AND EMPLOYS MORE THAN THREE POINT TWO MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA ONE FOURTH OF CALIFORNIA'S TOTAL AND EMPLOYMENT WE ARE THE ONLY STATEWIDE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING ALL SEGMENTS OF THE RETAIL INDUSTRY INCLUDING GENERAL MERCHANDISE DEPARTMENT STORES MASS MERCHANDISERS RESTAURANTS CONVENIENCE STORES. SUPERMARKETS AND GROCERY STORES CHAIN DRAG AND SPECIALLY RETAIL SUCH AS AUTO VISION JURY HARDWARE AND HOME STORES. YOU CAN IMAGINE THIS ATTACK THIS GREATLY. AND THE STATE VISITORS A DAY SITE REGARDING THE TIME CALIFORNIA SHOWS THAT THE RETAIL INDUSTRY AS THE DRIVING FORCE OF OUR ECONOMY. WHETHER A NATIONAL BRAND OR LOCAL STORE FRANK RETAILERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA SUPPORT A ROBUST ECONOMY WITH A STRONG WORK FORCE IN THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. JERRY IS COMMITTED TO STABILIZING AND STRENGTHENING THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT TO BOLSTER EXISTING EMPLOYERS ATTRACT NEW ONES AND MOST IMPORTANTLY TO PROTECT OUR CUSTOMERS. I'M HONORED TO BE INCLUDED TODAY ABOUT THIS THE IMPACT OF THE TRADE DISPUTE. AND ESPECIALLY HOW IT'S GOING TO PERTAIN TO OUR RETAIL INDUSTRY. FIRST OF ALL LET'S REMEMBER TARIFFS OR TAXES RIGHT THEY'RE PAID BY CALIFORNIA'S FAMILIES BUSINESSES WORKERS AND COMMUNITIES. TODAY CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS HAVE PAID THREE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL TERRACE THAT INCLUDES THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE MILLION IN MARCH ALONE. SINCE THE TRADE WORDS BEGAN% CALIFORNIA EXPORTS FACED ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN NEW RETALIATORY TERRACE FROM OUR TRADING PARTNERS. INCLUDING A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION IN JANUARY. THESE TERRACE MAKE CALIFORNIA LESS COMPETITIVE. ABOUT SOME LARGE RETAIL BRANDS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ABSORB INCREASED COST AND NOT PASS THEM ON TO CONSUMERS. THAT IS NOT THE CASE WITH THIS ROUND OF TERROR OF NEGOTIATIONS WELL WE AGREE WITH THE NEED TO ADDRESS LONG STANDING ISSUES WITH CHINA'S UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES. AND WANT TO SEE A MEANINGFUL TRADE DEAL THAT LEVELS THE PLAYING FIELD FOR CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES AND WORKERS. DOUBLING DOWN ON A STRATEGY BASED SOLELY ON TERRACE IS TOO GREAT A GAMBLE FOR THE US ECONOMY CALIFORNIA. AND CONSUMERS ACROSS THE STATE. WE NEED TO REMEMBER WHAT IS AT STAKE WHEN TERRACE ARE PUT INTO PLACE. CALIFORNIA'S BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS. WITH LIMITED RESOURCES SMALLER RETAILERS BASED A DIS APPROPRIATE CARE OF BURDEN WE KNOW SMALL BUSINESSES ARE ALREADY HURTING FROM THIS TRADE WAR AND CAN AFFORD MORE TERRORISTS. IN THESE SMALL BIZ THESE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS CAN NO LONGER BE COMPETITIVE IN CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY WE COULD SEE THEM SHUTTING THEIR DOORS AND LAYING OFF EMPLOYEES. THIS COULD NEVER NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE AND COULD HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT IN OUR WORLD AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. AND HAVE A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. WHEN THE TERRACE WHERE THE 10% LEVEL SOME RETAILERS ADOPTED STRATEGIES TO LESSEN THE BURDEN ON CONSUMERS WHILE HOPING THE INCREASED COSTS WOULD ONLY BE SHORT TERM SHORT SHORT TERM? HOWEVER MANY SMALL RETAILERS WITH LIMITED RESOURCES COULD NOT ABSORB THOSE TERRORISTS CAM ARE FORCED TO INCREASE THE COST. THOSE COSTS ARE NOW PAID BY THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER. MY TERRACE ABOUT25% WE TAYLOR'S WILL HAVE A HARDER TIME MITIGATING THE IMPACT AND CONSUMERS WILL START TO SEE MORE NOTICEABLE PRICE INCREASES. ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S THREAT TO TARGET ALL CHINESE IMPORTS. IF THOSE THREATS BECOME REALITY CONSUMERS WILL SEE PRICES RISE FURTHER IN A RANGE OF PRODUCTS INCLUDING FURNITURE LUGGAGE. BICYCLES AUTO PARTS APPLIANCES SPORTING GOODS AND MORE. WE TELL OFFER WITH WE OPERATE IN A VERY COMPETITIVE MARKET. AND SOME COMPANIES MAY DEAL WITH THE ADDED COSTS IN OTHER WAYS IN ORDER TO STAY COMPETITIVE ON PRICING. FOR EXAMPLE. THE TERRORISTS COULD DISCOURAGE CALIFORNIA INVESTMENTS RELATING TO STORES DISTRIBUTION CENTERS EMPLOYMENT DECISIONS TECHNOLOGY AND E. COMMERCE. ALL OF THESE WILL IMPACT WORKERS CONSUMERS AND CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY IN A NEGATIVE WAY. NOT ONLY COULD CALIFORNIA C. INCREASE PRICES ARE GOODS WE NEED A CALIFORNIANS ARE AT RISK OF LOSING RETAIL JOBS. AND THAT'S REMEMBER. RETAIL ACCOUNTS FOR ONE FOURTH OF CALIFORNIA'S JOB FORCE. SELECT MY LET ME BE CLEAR BY MORE THAN DOUBLING THE TERRACE THIS WILL DISCOURAGE INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA RESULTING IN LOST JOBS IN HIGHER PRICES. HIGHER PRICES THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS WILL HAVE TO PAY. RETAILERS LIVING FREE B THE INVENTORY CYCLES WHETHER IT'S A LARGE NATIONAL CHAIN OR YOUR SMALL MAKE YOUR YOUR SMALL MAINSTREET RETAILER PRICE INCREASES ULTIMATELY DEPENDS ON WHAT THEY HAVE IN STOCK NOW. AND WHAT STOCK WILL BE SUBJECT TO THESE TARIFFS. RETAILERS MAKE PRODUCTION. N. SOURCING DECISION MONTHS AND YEARS IN ADVANCE AND REPLY I'M VERY COMPLEX SUPPLY CHAINS. THEY CANNOT EASILY OR QUICKLY SHIFTED TO DOMESTIC SOURCES BECAUSE THOSE SOURCES TO NOT EXIST ON A SCALE THAT THEY NEED. EVEN IF THERE IS AN EVENTUAL SWITCH TO ONLY SOURCES FROM US SUPPLIERS IT WOULD TAKE YEARS TO BUILD UP THAT BASE OF SUPPORT. THE INCREASE TERRACE WELL HIGH PRICES FOR ITEMS CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS NEED. I LATEST ROUND OF TERRACE COULD BRING THE ANNUAL COST OF THE TYPICAL HOUSEHOLD TO EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE DOLLARS. PRODUCTS LIKE SO MANICURE ITEMS AND YOUR TO READ ARE ON THE LIST OF GOODS AFFECTED BY THE TERRACE AND WILL COST MORE. MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WILL STICK WITH THEIR OLD WASHING MACHINE TELEVISION COMPUTER MONITOR THEY WILL REFRAIN FROM BUYING NEW CLOTHES AND FURNITURE. CALIFORNIA FAMILIES RUN FIXED INCOMES COULD BE GREATLY IMPACTED AS WE SEEK ROB LET PROJECT BROUGHT THAT TO HAVE GROWTH DECLINE. LAYOFFS TAKE PLACE AND PRICES INCREASE FOR NEEDED GOODS ACROSS THE STATE. AS RETAILERS ARE HIT WITH HIGHER TARIFFS THAT THEY CAN NO LONGER ABSORB. AS THERE IS UNCERTAINTY IN THE MARKET PLACE MAKING IT HARDER FOR RETAILERS TO MAKE LONG RANGE SUPPLY PLANS PRICES WILL INCREASE AND THE FINAL PURCHASES OF GOODS OR PURCHASE LESS. BECAUSE THE GOODS COST MORE. SALES DECLINES EVENTUALLY LEAD TO UNEMPLOYMENT CUTS AND EMPLOYMENT CUTS RESULT IN LOWER CONSUMER SPENDING. ON A RANGE OF GOODS AND SERVICES. SO CONSUMERS INSTEAD OF BUYING THAT NEW CAR THE FAMILY'S GOING TO BUY A USED CAR. FAMILIES WILL GO OUT TO DINNER LESS UNEMPLOYED WORKERS WILL CUT EVEN MORE DISCRETIONARY PURCHASES. HEALTHCARE EXPENSES WILL BE POSTPONED. EACH OF THESE DECISIONS WILL HAVE EMPLOYMENT IMPACTS ON THE CALIFORNIA WORKER THE RETAIL INDUSTRY AND OUR ECONOMY. SERIES SUPPORTS THE EFFORT TO ACHIEVE A MEANINGFUL TRADE AGREEMENT WITH CHINA AND WE'RE HOPEFUL THESE NEGOTIATIONS GET BACK ON TRACK. BOTH SIDES HAVE MADE IMPORTANT PROGRESS TO ADDRESS THE LONGSTANDING ISSUES REGARDING TRADE BUT WHAT CONCERNS US IS THAT **** FOR TAT TERRACE WILL UNDERMINE ANY PROGRESS AND LEAD TO A PROLONGED TRADE WAR THAT WILL DAMAGE CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. WE KNOW FROM HISTORY THAT ONCE TERRACE ARE IMPOSED THEY DON'T USUALLY COME OFF. AMERICAN CONSUMERS ARE STILL PAYING TERRACE THAT WERE PUT IN PLACE DURING THE GREAT DEPRESSION. THE THREAT OF TERROR OF SOME CHINESE IMPORTS IS TOO GREAT A GAMBLE FOR ABOUT THE US ECONOMY AND FOR CALIFORNIA. THIS LEVEL OF ESCALATION WILL WHILE OUR FINANCIAL MARKETS DESTROY JOBS RAISE PRICES FOR CALIFORNIA FAMILIES AND ULTIMATELY UNDERMINE THE ECONOMIC GAMES WE HAVE SEEN IN RECENT YEARS. SO WHAT DO RETAILERS WANT TO SEE. WE WOULD LIKE THE FULL IMMEDIATE REMOVAL OF TERRORISTS ANY DEAL MUST RESULT IN A COMPLETE WILL BACK OF IS IT A BIT SIXTEEN AND RETALIATORY TARIFFS WE WENT MEANING FOR FORMS TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD FOR CALIFORNIA WORKERS IN BUSINESS AND ADDRESS LONG STANDING UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES THAT. INNOVATION AT RISK. WE WANT TO AVOID ANY ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM THAT WOULD TRIGGER MORE TERRACE AND RESULT IN LONG TERM UNCERTAINTY. WELL WHAT CAN YEARS CALIFORNIA LAWMAKERS DO. CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY COULD SEE VERY NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF THE TERROR OF WORK CONTINUES. WE ASK STATE LAWMAKERS. TO LOOK AT THE REGULATIONS PLACED ON RETAILERS AND UNDERSTAND THAT WHILE SOME REGULATION BY WELL INTENDED. BURDENS RETAILERS WITH MORE COSTS THAT ARE COMPOUNDED BY THE PROPOSED TARIFFS BY LOOKING FOR WAYS TO LASSEN REGULATION ON CALIFORNIA'S RETAIL INDUSTRY. RETAILERS CAN LOOK AT WAYS TO NOT PASS ADDITIONAL COSTS ON TO CONSUMERS DUE TO THESE TERRACE. AND THEY CAN PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S JOBS CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY CALIFORNIA'S CONSUMERS. THE RETAIL ASSOCIATION AND WELCOMES THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THE SELECT COMMITTEE AND ANY OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES ON STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS THE TERROR OF SITUATION. AND WAYS THAT WILL PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S CONSUMERS WORKERS AND THE RETAIL INDUSTRY WHICH AGAIN ACCOUNTS FOR THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY AND EMPLOYS ONE FOURTH OF CALIFORNIA'S TOTAL EMPLOYMENT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MS MICHELIN AND WE DID -- ADD MS JENSEN -- TO TO THIS PANEL FOR SUBJECT MATTER HARMONY -- WHICH I'M GRATEFUL FOR PLEASE MISS JOHNSON THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF TECHNICIAN OR EIGHTY MEMBER COMPANIES REGARDING THE IMPACT OF THE U. S. TRYING TO TRADE WERE ON CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. FOR THE PAST YEAR THE US AND CHINA HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN A COSTLY TRADE WAR FROM THE BEGINNING TECH NET HAS STRONGLY OPPOSE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S POLICY OF SWEEPING TERRACE TO ACHIEVE ITS GOAL OF COMPELLING CHINA TO CHANGE ITS UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES. CALIFORNIA IS THE WORLD'S FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY A MAJOR REASON FOR THAT SUCCESS IS THAT WE ARE HOME TO THE WORLD'S PREEMINENT TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY. WHICH HELPS DEVELOP LIFE ENHANCING INNOVATIONS THAT THE REST OF THE WORLD WANTS TO BY. SELLING TO MORE MARKETS AND CONCERTS CUSTOMERS ABROAD DRIVES ECONOMIC GROWTH AND JOB CREATION IN THE U. S. TECH SECTOR IN FACT US TECH EXPORTS SUPPORTED AN ESTIMATED EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND AMERICAN JOBS AND SEVENTEEN CALIFORNIA BENEFITS THE MOST FROM THIS. TECH IS THE NUMBER ONE GOOD OUR STATE EXPORTS LAST YEAR ALONE WE EXPORTED TO TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOREIGN MARKETS MEXICO WAS FIRST CAÃ±ADA WAS SECOND AND CHINA WAS THIRD. HOWEVER THE TERRACE INCREASE THE COST OF MAKING OUR PRODUCTS OFF INCREASING THE PRICE TAG HIGHER PRICES MAKE THEM MORE EXPENSIVE AND HARDER TO SELL ABROAD. COMPETITION ABROAD IS FIERCE BUT WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT THE US TECH SECTOR LED BY CALIFORNIA'S MOST INNOVATIVE COMPANIES CAN COMPETE WITH ANYONE ON A FAIR AND LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. HOWEVER FAIR AND LEVEL IS NOT WHAT WE HAVE WHEN OUR FOREIGN COMPETITORS DO NOT HAVE TO DEAL WITH THESE TARIFFS AND CAN OFFER CAN SEE CAN CUSTOMERS PRODUCTS SIMILAR TO OURS AT A LOWER PRICE. TERRACE OUR TAXES THAT HEARD AMERICANS CONSUMERS WORKERS AND BUSINESSES OF ALL SIZES. THEY SLOW THE GROWTH OF THE US ECONOMIC OUTPUT AND WE CAN DEMAND FOR AMERICAN PRODUCTS AT HOME AND ABROAD. IN FACT ONE STUDY SHOWS THAT TERRACE WILL SLOW US ECONOMIC OUTPUT BY THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT DECADE. OVER THE PAST YEAR CHINA TERRACE HAVE LEAD TO HIGHER PRICES FOR CONSUMERS ON A WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS THAT THEY HAVE COME TO RELY ON THEY HAVE DISRUPTED. DISRUPTED SUPPLY CHAIN AND THREATENS LONG TERM PROJECTS SUCH AS DATA CENTERS AND THEY HAVE SHIFTED CAPITAL AWAY FROM LONG TERM INVESTMENTS IN THE NEXT WAVE OF INNOVATION THROUGH OUR INDIE EFFORTS. WE WANT TO STATE CLEARLY FOR THE RECORD THAT WE BELIEVE CHINA MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR ITS UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES INCLUDING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THEFT FORCED TO TECHNOLOGY TRANSFERS CYBERATTACKS AND CYBER ESPIONAGE. WE SHARE THE ADMINISTRATION'S GOAL SECURING LASTING AND ENFORCEABLE CHANGES FROM THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT THAT WILL PROTECT AMERICAN INNOVATORS AND THEIR IDEAS. ALLOW US COMPANIES A CHANCE TO COMPETE ON A MORE LEVEL PLAYING FIELD AND IMPROVE MARKET ACCESS. TERRACE HOWEVER ARE NOT THE SOLUTION INSTEAD OF PURSUING TERRORISTS ON OUR ALLIES AND TRADING PARTNERS AROUND THE WORLD THE US SHOULD BE WORKING WITH OUR ALLIES TO PRESSURE CHINA TO CHANGE ITS TRADE PRACTICES. VIRTUALLY NO PRODUCT IN US CHINA COMMERCE HAS BEEN LEFT UNTOUCHED BY THE TERRORISTS THIS INCLUDES POPULAR CONSUMER PRODUCTS THAT AMERICANS HAVE COME TO RELY ON EACH DAY. LIKE SMARTPHONES CONNECTED DEVICES AND COMPUTERS CALIFORNIA BASED COMPANIES LEAD THE WORLD IN THE MOBILE PHONE A PHONE AND CONNECTED DEVICE INDUSTRY IS ONE COMPANIES IN THIS SPACE COMPETE IT DRIVES DOWN PRICES FOR U. S. CONSUMERS INCLUDING LOWER INCOME AMERICANS WHO CAN. WHO CAN INCREASINGLY GAIN ACCESS TO CUTTING EDGE MOBILE DEVICES JUST AS IMPORTANT THESE PRODUCTS HAVE BECOME FOUNDATIONAL TECHNOLOGIES AND CRITICAL PRODUCT PRODUCTIVITY TOOLS FOR A WIDE RANGE OF TRADITIONAL INDUSTRIES INCLUDING AGRICULTURE? MANUFACTURING HEALTHCARE AND OTHER KEY PARTS OF OUR ECONOMY. BUT PUTTING TERRACE ON U. S. MOBILE PHONES AND OTHER CONNECTED DEVICES GIVES OUR COMPETITIVE COMPETITORS INTO KOREA CHINA AND ELSEWHERE A LAKE UP RAISING PRICES FOR U. S.. DEVICES WHILE MAKING IT HARDER FOR COMPANIES ACROSS ALL SECTORS OF OUR ECONOMY TO LEVERAGE THESE INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES. THIS HURT SOMEONE LIVING ON A FIXED INCOME AS MUCH AS IT HURTS HARMS THE FARMER IN CENTRAL VALLEY LOOKING FOR A NEW MOBILE TOOLS TO PREVENT CROP DAMAGE AND IMPROVE YIELDS. NETWORKING PRODUCTS THAT COMPRISE THE MODERN DAY INFRASTRUCTURE CONNECTING US ALL OF BEEN HIT HARD INCLUDING MODEMS ROUTERS AND SWITCHES OPTICAL AND FIBER OPTIC TRANSCEIVERS NETWORK INTERFACE CARDS ADAPTERS AND MODULES ACCESS POINTS REMOTE ACCESS POINTS AND ANTENNAS AND BEGINS. AT A MOMENT WE ARE WHEN WE ARE ENGAGED IN A GLOBAL FIVE G. RACE THE TERRORISTS ARE HITTING THE NETWORKING PRODUCTS THAT ARE NEEDED FOR FIVE JEEZ INFRASTRUCTURE. TERRACE ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON SMALL BUSINESSES THAT USE ONLINE PLATFORMS TO SELL AROUND THE WORLD. TERRACE INCREASE THE COST OF THEIR INVENTORY AND RETALIATORY TERRACE HURT THEIR ABILITY TO SELL GLOBALLY. TERRACE ON THESE AND MANY OTHER TRIBES OF PRODUCTS DO NOT JUST HER AT THE TECH SECTOR BECAUSE THESE ITEMS ARE ESSENTIAL AND ARE INCREASINGLY CONNECTED WORLD. THESE TERRACE HURT ALL SECTORS AND BUSINESSES OF ALL SIZES. I AM PROUD TO BE HERE TODAY WITH MEMBERS OF CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY. IN RECENT YEARS TECH THAT HAS WORKED WITH ELECTED OFFICIALS AND STAKEHOLDERS AND CENTRAL VALLEY TO IDENTIFY WAYS THE TECHNIQUE TECH SECTOR CAN BE A MORE EFFECTIVE PARTNER. IT IS CLEAR THAT AMERICA'S FARMERS ARE AMONG THE MOST NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE TERROR FOR BETWEEN THE US AND CHINA. THEIR PRESENCE HERE TODAY REMINDS US THAT THE TERRACE ON TECHNOLOGY ALSO HARM OTHER SECTORS OF THE US ECONOMY THAT RELY ON INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY IS TO RUN THEIR BUSINESSESMORE FACT EFFICIENTLY. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT IN ADDITION TO THE CROPS BEING TARGETED HIGHER TARIFFS ON TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS THAT FARMERS INCREASINGLY USED TO MANAGE WATER DETECTIVES EASES AND MAKE BETTER DECISIONS ARE HURTING THEM AS WELL. THIS INCLUDES ROBOTS SENSORS CAMERAS FUEL CELLS AND SPECIALIZED BATTERIES AS WELL AS CLOUD COMPUTING AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE APPLICATIONS. IN ADDITION TO FARMS OUR PRODUCTS ARE BEING USED EACH AND EVERY DAY TO ENHANCE COMMUNICATION EFFICIENCY HE AND PRODUCTIVITY AND OFFICES FACTORIES SCHOOLS HOSPITALS AIRPORTS AND ACROSS ALL STATE GOVERNMENT ENTITIES. THESE TERRORISTS ARE TAXES ON ALL OF THEM. AND SO LAST YEAR TECH MEN -- SPECIFICALLY ON DATA CENTER TERRACE LAST YEAR TECH THAT HIGHLIGHTED THE SPECIFIC HARM CAUSED BY TERRACE ON SERVERS TRANSMISSION DEVICES AND OTHER KEY COMPUTING. COMPONENTS THAT MAKE UP THE DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO BUILD AND OPERATE DATA CENTERS DATA CENTERS ARE THE LIFE BLOOD OF AN INCREASINGLY DATA DRIVEN ECONOMY AND CAN BE FOUND IN EVERY STATE. ONE STUDY SHOWS THAT ONCE OPERATIONAL THE AVERAGE DATACENTER ACTUALLY GENERATES THIRTY TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF LOCAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY EACH YEAR AND DURING THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE EACH DATACENTER GENERATES NEARLY TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHILE EMPLOYING AN AVERAGE OF ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT WORKERS. TERRACE ON ESSENTIAL DATACENTER COMPONENTS SUCH AS TRIPS SERVERS AND TRANSMISSION DEVICES THREATENED TO STALL THIS ENGINE OF ECONOMIC GROWTH THEY DISRUPT SUPPLY CHAINS INCREASE COSTS THROUGH TO FACTOR TAXES AND INJECT UNCERTAINTY INTO BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND LOCAL ECONOMIES. THAT HOST DATA CENTERS DATA CENTERS ARE COMPLICATED SUPPLY CHAIN PROJECTS THAT RELY ON ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY OF RECEIVING KEY COMPONENTS AND A TIMELY AND COST EFFECTIVE WAY. IF CRITICAL PIECES CONTINUE TO BE HELD UP FOR DELIVERY AT A LATER DATE WITH HIGHER MORE UNPREDICTABLE COSTS COMPANIES WOULD BE INCENTIVIZE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS AND CREATE JOBS IN OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE SUCH NEEDLESS AND CERTAINTY DOES NOT EXIST. IN ESSENCE THESE TERRORISTS NOT ONLY HURT THE AMERICAN TAX SECTOR THE ADMINISTRATION IS WORKING TO PROTECT. BUT THEY ALSO HEARD MANY MORE WORKERS AT CROSS VARIOUS SECTORS WHO OPERATIONS RELY ON CLOUD COMPUTING AND DATA MANAGEMENT TOOLS. AND THEN JUST BRIEFLY ON R. AND D. AS SO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IS THE LIFEBLOOD OF INNOVATION SOME OF TECH MATS MEMBER COMPANIES SPEND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS EACH YEAR AND ARE INDEED DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS AND ENHANCE EXISTING ONES. OVERALL THE U. S. CURRENTLY AS THE GLOBAL LEADING LEADER AND ARE IN DE SPENDING INVESTING MORE THAN FIVE DOLLARS AN R. AND D. FOR EVERY ONE DOLLAR SPENT BY CHINESE COMPANIES. HOWEVER THESE TERRORISTS ARE TAXES AND ONE TAXES ON THE PRIVATE SECTOR GO UP IT MEANS OPERATING COSTS GO UP AND TOUGH DECISIONS HAVE TO BE MADE ABOUT COMPETING PRIORITIES. ONE OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS IS STAINED TRADE WAR AS HAVING LESS MONEY TO INVEST IN OUR ANDY. SALAS AND DONE THE IMPACT OF TERRORISTS ON OUR INDIE INVESTMENTS MAYBE MAY MAYBE THE MOST DAMAGING CONSEQUENCE OF ALL. WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT KINDS OF TECHNOLOGICAL OUT BREAK THROUGHS WELL SEED ARE WE WILL SEE TO OUR INTERNATIONAL COMPETITORS BY FORFEITING INVESTMENTS IN THE NEXT WAVE OF INNOVATION -- MEMBERS ALTHOUGH THE FOCUS OF TODAY'S HEARING IS ON THE TERRACE POLICIES IN CHINA WE WOULD BE REMISS IF WE DID NOT ALSO HIGHLIGHT THE DEEP CONCERNS AND STRONG OPPOSITION WE HAVE TO THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S NEWLY PROPOSED TARIFFS ON MEXICO WHICH WERE ANNOUNCED LAST THURSDAY. MEXICO IS OUR NEIGHBOR OUR TRADING PARTNER AND OUR ALLY THE CALIFORNIA MEXICAN ECONOMIES HAVE BEEN LINKED FOR CENTURIES AND GENERATED ENORMOUS ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY FOR BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER FOR BOTH OF OUR POPULATIONS. IN FACT MEXICO'S CALIFORNIA'S NUMBER ONE TRADING PARTNER THE VALUE OF CALIFORNIA'S EXPORTS TO MEXICO HAS RISEN MORE THAN 20% OVER FOUR YEARS TO THIRTY POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN TECHNET OPPOSES THESE TERRACE ON MEXICO AND WE URGE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO ABANDON THIS PLAN. IN CONCLUSION THIS PROLONG TRADE WAR IS HURTING AMERICAN CONSUMERS WORKERS AND JOB CREATORS ACROSS ALL SECTORS CHINA MUST BE CONFRONTED ABOUT IT'S UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES BUT HI TERRACE ON A 100% OF CHINESE EXPORS IMPORTS WILL HAVE A DEVASTATING IMPACT ON THE LONG TERM HEALTH OF THE US ECONOMY. AT THE END OF THIS MONTH PRESIDENT TRUMP IS EXPECTED TO MEET WITH THE CHINESE PRESIDENT THE G. TWENTY SUMMIT WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT THIS FACE TO FACE MEETING BETWEEN THE LEADERS WILL. LEAD TO A BREAKTHROUGH WE URGE THEM TO LISTEN TO THE CONCERNS FROM CALIFORNIA WHICH ARE BEING SO WELL ARTICULATED HERE TODAY -- AND IN THE MEANTIME TECH MATT AND OUR PARTNERS WILL CONTINUE TO URGE BOTH CHINA AND THE U. S. GOVERNMENT'S TO WORK STRENUOUSLY TO RESOLVE THE SITUATION AND AND THE TERRORISTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- THERE'S A LOT TO DIVE INTO WITH A WITH. THE FIRST THREE MEMBERS OF OF THE PANEL AND AND SO I WANT TO JUST JUMP RIGHT IN PARTICULARLY WITH THE IMPACT ON RETAILERS -- WHICH EVERYONE SEES THOSE IMPACTS EVERYONE UP HERE -- BUT WE'VE SEEN JUST BE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING BRICK AND MORTAR RETAILER -- WHETHER IT'S STRICTLY APPAREL OR EVEN A DEPARTMENT STORES THAT CARRY MUCH MORE LIKE SEARS AND PARTICULARLY IN DIFFERENT QUALITY SEGMENTS. AND AND SO WITH CHINA -- AND AND IT'S IT'S ONE HAS A GROWING MIDDLE CLASS. COSTS OF PRODUCING IN CHINA HAVE GONE UP BUT AT THE SAME TIME QUALITY HAS GONE UP WITH PRODUCTS FROM CHINA AS WELL. WILL WE SEE A THOSE RETAILERS THAT BY LESSER QUALITY LOWER COST GOODS FROM REGIONS THE WORLD THAT PAY LESS -- WE SEE MORE OF THOSE PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES. OR WILL OR OR WILL WE JUST SEE A LOT OF THESE COMPANIES YOU KNOW CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE ALONG WITHOUT SHIFTING WHERE MANUFACTURING TAKES PLACE. I THINK IT DEPENDS ON THE ON WHO THE RETAILER IS I THINK SOME OF THAT MAY BE THE LARGER NATIONAL BRANDS WILL BE ABLE TO GO A LITTLE BIT LONGER AND ABSORB SOME OF THAT THE INCREASED COSTS. ARE CONCERNED -- PARTICULARLY SMALLER RETAILERS I MEAN THERE'S A LOT OF THEM IN CALIFORNIA I MEAN THERE'S A LET ME GO DOWN THE OLD SAT THOSE ARE ALL SMALL RETAILERS THAT ARE GONNA BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THIS. AND THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE EITHER THEY CAN STAY IN BUSINESS BY MAYBE HAVING TO FIND OTHER SOURCES THEY'RE CHEAPER MAYBE NOT THE SAME QUALITY THAT THEY WERE GETTING BEFORE OR THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CLOSE DOWN AND NOT BE ABLE TO TO HAVE THE BUSINESS ANYMORE. SO I THINK AND IT DEPENDING ON HOW LONG THESE TERRORISTS CONTINUE. YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO TO SOME OF THE LARGER AND LARGER RETAILER CHAINS AS WELL I MEAN THEY THEY RUN ON A VERY SMALL PROFIT MARGIN. THEY'RE VERY COMPETITIVE THEIR COMPETITIVE AGAINST EACH OTHER SO THEY'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR WAYS TO BE COMPETITIVE WHEN IT COMES TO PRICING. AND THOSE ARE SOME OF THE DECISIONS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE FORCED TO MAKE. THANK YOU SON RACHMAN. YEAH GONNA ALONG THAT SEAM LINES I CAN SEE A SCENARIO WHERE LARGER RETAILERS MIGHT HAVE THINGS OFF IN A WAREHOUSE SOMEWHERE AND CAN WORK ON THEIR SUPPLIERS A SMALLER. RETAILER DOESN'T HAVE THAT THAT FLEXIBILITY RIGHT SO THEY'RE BY MORE -- AND SO AS WE'VE SEEN IN THE AGRICULTURE COMMUNITY AS SMALLER FARMS HAVE GONE AWAY AND LARGE CORPORATE FARMS ABOUT THEM UP WE CONTINUE TO SEE I THINK THE THE LOSS OF THE SMALL AND MID LEVEL FARMS -- UP RETAILERS GOING MORE TOWARDS LARGE ONES OR EVEN IN TWO TO ONLINE SHOPPING. I THINK THAT'S THAT COULD ABSOLUTELY HAPPEN AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT'S CONCERNING BECAUSE WHEN YOU GO INTO THE SMALL TOWNS IN CALIFORNIA HERE YOU GO DOWN THE MAIN STREETS AND ON SOME OF THESE OLD TOWNS IT'S THOSE RETAILERS THAT ARE KIND OF WHERE PEOPLE GO THEY GET THEIR GOSSIP AND THE COMMUNITY. THEY THAT THAT CONNECTS THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND IF THOSE RETAILERS CANNOT STAY COMPETITIVE THEY'RE GOING TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS I THINK YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IN YOUR COMMENTS SOME OF THE LARGER RETAILERS DO YOU HAVE. THE ABILITY TO HAVE IN TORY THAT THEY CAN TAP INTO BUT ONLY FOR SO LONG BUT PRETTY SOON EIGHTIES COSTUME TO BE CONTINUED ON TO THE CONSUMERS. AND BE YES WE COULD ABSOLUTELY SEE THAT AND I AND I THINK IT WILL EVENTUALLY COULD AFFECT THE LARGER RETAILERS WHEN YOU SEE MORE YOU KNOW ONLINE ECOMMERCE. WHICH YEAH WELL THAT'S GREAT BENEFITS THEY'RE ALSO THEY'RE ALSO THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK OUT FOR WITHOUT IS CONCERNED SO I THINK YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT IS THE FAX. EACH TYPE OF RETAIL IN A DIFFERENT WAY BUT I THINK EVEN THOUGH A LOT OF OUR MEMBERS ARE SUCH AS THE LARGER BRANDS. THEY ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR THE SMALL BUSINESSES IN THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS THAT MAYBE OF HOW THIS RETAIL ESTABLISHMENT FOR YEARS THAT WON'T BE ABLE TO COMPETE ANYMORE. WE JUST HAD A SMALL LITTLE DRUGSTORE IN MY IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD WHEN THE LAST OLD NEIGHBORHOOD DRUGSTORES HUNDRED YEARS IN BUSINESS JUST CLOSE THEIR DOORS AND IT'S SAD I MEAN IT'S ANY MORE IN THAT LOSS IN YOUR COMMUNITY. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN. FURTHER ON THE RETAIL. SEGMENT TONIGHT. APPAREL IN PARTICULAR WHICH I'M CONCERNED ABOUT BECAUSE THERE ARE SEASONAL CHANGES YOU CAN'T KEEP THE SAME GOODS. AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE GOING TO WEAR THE SAME CLOTHES FROM SEASON TO SEASON THEY HAVE TO CHANGE -- AND OF COURSE STYLES TO CHANGE AS WELL SO -- YOU KNOW HOW. HOW DO YOU THINK YOU FEEL THAT THAT'S GOING TO REALLY IMPACT -- CONSUMER CHOICE -- IN WHAT WHAT OPTIONS THAT THEY HAVE AND WHETHER OR NOT RETAILERS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THAT TYPE OF CHANGE WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE GARMENTS THAT CAN GO FROM SEASON TO SEASON HAVE YOU SEEN ANYONE. ANY OF YOUR MEMBERS DEALING WITH THAT NOW. I'M NOT YET BY YOU KNOW THAT GOES TO THE SUPPLY CHAIN THAT GOES CAN THEY GET THEIR GOODS INTO THE US HOW MUCH IS IT GOING TO COST. AND THAT ALSO IS GOING TO BE IMPACTED BY WHAT CONSUMERS ARE GOING TO BUY I MEAN IF THEY'RE HAVING TO PAY MORE MONEY. FOR THEIR FOOD OR FOR THE ESSENTIAL ITEMS THAT THEY NEED AND THOSE COSTS HAVE GONE AT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE LESS MONEY TO SPEND ON SOME OF THOSE TYPES OF THINGS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. SO I THINK YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT IT FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE AND BUT I DO THINK THEY I MEAN RETAILERS WILL LOOK AT HOW THEY CAN STAY IN BUSINESS HOW CAN THEY WEATHER THIS STORM. AND PART OF IT MAY BE A REDUCED INVENTORY BUT THEY WILL WANT TO DO WHATEVER THEY CAN IN ORDER TO STAY COMPETITIVE. BUT YOU'RE RIGHT I MEAN IN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY I MEAN WELL EVEN HERE IN IN SACRAMENTO WE HAD IT SEEMED LIKE A LONG WINTER AND NOW WE'RE BACK. TWO HUNDRED INCREASING COSTS ON DEODORANT AND YOU KNOW I MEAN AN EXIT MY HUSBAND AND I WERE LOOKING AT A NEW REFRIGERATOR AND I KIND OF WHAT WE SHOULD BUY IT NOW BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE CHEAPER NOW THAN IF WE WAIT A COUPLE OF MONTHS AND I THINK. THOSE ARE SOME DECISIONS THAT CONSUMERS ARE GONNA HAVE TO MAKE BUT THEN THE OTHER PIECE OF THIS IS THAT AS RETAILERS ARE LOOKING TO CUT COSTS THAT ALSO MEANS CUTTING JOBS. YOU KNOW ONCE YOU COULD HAVE CALIFORNIANS WHO WHO WORK IN THE RETAIL INDUSTRY. NOT HAVING A JOB ANYMORE AND THEN WHAT DOES THAT DO THAT ADDS TO THE PROBLEM AND IT HAS A BIGGER IMPACT IN SO WE REALLY THINK THAT SEEING. WE HOPE SOME POSITIVE IN ROADS WITH THESE TARIFFS CALM BECAUSE I DON'T THINK WE'VE REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT IMPACT IS TRULY GOING TO HAVE. UNLESS THEY CAN YOU KNOW PROLONGS THE HIPS AND WINTER COATS COMING WELL I DEFINITELY WANT TO PASS OVER -- TO IT TO YOU MISTER DAVIS BECAUSE MS MICHELIN MENTIONED. APPLIANCES REFRIGERATORS TALK ABOUT STORAGE -- YOU KNOW WHAT'S COMING OVER AND CARGO SHIPS IS THERE A A SECTOR THAT YOUR SCENE -- OR DID SEE MORE OF THAT TYPE OF SHIPMENT COMING IN TO GET IN AHEAD OF THOSE TERRORISTS FOR THAT TYPE OF BEHAVIOR NOT OCCUR. I THINK THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T HAVE I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH DISABILITY AT LEAST AT THE PORT LEVEL THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT DIFFERENT METRICS THAT ARE USED -- YOU CAN MEASURE AND BE OF VALUE VOLUME TONNAGE CONTAINERS SO I THINK I'D REALLY SORT OF WANTED TO FOR TO SOME OF THE INDIVIDUAL SORT OF SECTORS DISORDER REALLY DID YOU KNOW. TELL US WHERE THEY'RE SAYING AND I THINK FROM A AN OVERALL LEVEL WE SAW JUST A MARKET SURGE AND WE WERE HEARING AT LEAST FROM. ON EVERY CONCEIVABLE TYPE OF SECTOR WEATHER WAS BASIC MANUFACTURING THE RETAIL ENVIRONMENT FROM TACK JUST PEOPLE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT BECAUSE AGAIN AT THE PORT LEVEL IT WAS. STARTING TO MANIFEST ITSELF THROUGH -- BOXES THAT WE WEREN'T EXPECTING IN THE REGULAR CYCLE THAT WERE COMING IN OFF SEASON -- SURE IN THE COMING IN SIX MONTHS EARLY THAN WHAT WE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT NORMAL SO MICHAEL WOULD LOOK LIKE AND SO THEY WERE GETTING FOR IT BURIED IN A STACK AND IT LED TO YOU KNOW. LITERALLY HAVING TO TRIAGE EVERY SENSE SINGLE CAR. WHICH IS NOT HOW WE ONE INTRODUCE OURSELVES TO THE SHIPPING LINES IN ON THAT KIND OF BIGGER PICTURE TRAFFIC ISSUE ARE YOU SEEN CONTAINER SHIPS COMING IN FROM DIFFERENT PORTS ARE GOING OUT TO DIFFERENT PORTS THEN THE CROSS SPECIFIC CHINA -- CALIFORNIA A TRADE I DON'T THINK WE'VE SEEN ANY MAJOR DISRUPTIONS IN THE ACTUAL STRINGS FOR THE SHIPPING ROUTES I THINK WE'RE OBVIOUSLY JUST SEEING -- DIFFERENT VOLUMES IN VARYING LEVELS AGAIN LIKE WE'RE SEEING A SURGEON IN EMPTY BOXES THAT ARE NOW YOU KNOW. MAKING A WAY BACK ACROSS THE PACIFIC SO ON TAXES NOT ADDING A LOT OF VALUE TO THE WORK THAT WE DO WERE CERTAINLY TO OUR ECONOMY -- WE LIKE TO EE THOSE BOXES GO BACK FULL OF GOODS BE EITHER FROM A MANUFACTURED STANDPOINT AG STANDPOINT. SO -- NO STRINGS HAVE BEEN IMPACTED THIS POINT WE DID ACTUALLY SEE LAST YEAR THOUGH AND BECAUSE OF THAT BACK UP -- A COUPLE OF THE LINES THAT WOULD NORMALLY SAY GO TO LIKE LOS ANGELES AND THEN OAKLAND AND THEN BACK TO ASIA THEY WOULD JUST SKIP AROUND ENTIRELY BECAUSE THEY WERE NEEDING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE -- ON SCHEDULE FOR THEIR NEXT FOR THE NEXT APPOINTMENT. WE DO A LABOR REPRESENTATIVE IN THE NEXT PANEL DO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF HOW THIS IS IMPACTING JOBS WITH RELATED -- TO INCREASE OR DECREASE OF TRAFFIC YEAH WILL CERTAINLY FROM A PORT PERSPECTIVE I THINK THAT THERE'S ENOUGH BUSINESS TO GO AROUND SO WE HAVEN'T SEEN TURN OF ANY. YOU KNOW BACKUPS OF FOLKS NOT BEING CALLED OUT TO THE TERMINALS -- CERTAINLY AS IT AFFECTS THE ECOSYSTEM -- THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE SUPPLY CHAIN I MEAN IN THE SHORT TERM IT MAY BE HARD TO MEASURE IT THIS WAY TO CONTINUE OVER THE LONG TERM THAT'S AND OUT OF ALL THAT. THAT THIS IS GOING TO HAVE LONG TERM IMPACTS TO OUR ECONOMY AND CERTAINLY TO OUR WORK FORCE. THE SERVER MISS JENSEN. I THINK FROM A CONSUMER PERSPECTIVE WE SEE UNDERSTAND LIKE WAVES OF OF TRADE IF WE THINK ABOUT IT THIS DEEPLY WHEN THE NEW A CELLPHONE COMES OUT. AND OKAY THERE'S A NEW GALAXY OR THERE'S A NEW IPHONE -- THIS IS GONNA BE CERTAIN SEASONS FOR THIS IS GOING TO OCCUR AROUND YOU KNOW CHRISTMAS TIME TYPE OF SALES AS WELL FOR FOR BIG ITEMS -- AND SO YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE DOES THAT PRESSURE POINT HIT SOME OF YOUR MEMBERS THAT ARE DEALING WITH THAT TYPE OF A TECHNOLOGY YOU'RE LOOKING TO PUSH THEIR TECHNOLOGY OUT. ON THOSE NEW MODELS. YEAH I THINK YOU KNOW WE'RE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM IMPACTS I MEAN I THINK WE'RE ALL HOPING THIS GETS DEALT WITH QUICK. SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE THOSE IMPACTS RIGHT -- THOSE YOU KNOW VERY EXPENSIVE IMPACTS I THINK THERE'S IMPACTS FROM A INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER HOUSEHOLD STANDPOINT AND THEN ALSO ON OUR BUSINESSES RIGHT BECAUSE TECHNOLOGY IS USED. AS YOU KNOW I STATE MY COMMENTS BUT IT TECHNOLOGIES USE FROM A PERSONAL STANDPOINT YOUR PERSONAL USE OF YOURSELF ON ALL THOSE OTHER THINGS BUT TECHNOLOGIES ALSO USED BY OUR BUSINESSES IN ORDER TO CREATE MORE JOBS IN CALIFORNIA TO DO MORE EFFICIENCY. AND SO I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF THE IMPACT AND WE'VE BEEN SEEING THE IMPACTS FROM TERRACE AND FROM SORT OF THE UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES AND TO THOSE TYPES OF DATA CENTERS TO THE LARGER TECHNOLOGY -- PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN GOING ON THAT BUSINESS TO BUSINESS USAGE -- AND THEN WHEN WE DRILL DOWN OF THIS TERROR FOR CONTINUES LONG TERM WE'RE GONNA SEE IMPACTS AND WE'RE GONNA SEE COSTS GO UP FOR THE INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER DO YOU SEE A SHIFT IN WERE COMPONENTS ARE MANUFACTURED. SORRY SAID DO YOU SEE A SHIFT WORK COMPONENTS ARE MANUFACTURED. IT'S ALWAYS AN OPTION RIGHT OF WHERE IT'S MANUFACTURED IF IT GETS TOO EXPENSIVE TO MANUFACTURE THEM IN CALIFORNIA YEAH I COULD SEE YOU KNOW MANUFACTURING -- HAPPENED FOR USING PARTS ARE MANUFACTURED IN OTHER COUNTRIES OR MOVING DATA CENTER MANUFACTURING TO OTHER COUNTRIES I'M YOU KNOW PRODUCING THOSE IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES I MEAN IT IF THOSE THIS LONG TERM TRADE WORK GOES ON I THINK BUSINESSES ARE REALLY GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT. SORT OF WHAT THEIR BREAKING POINT IS I AM AND WHAT CONSUMERS BREAKING POINT AS TO I MEAN IF WE IF WE CONTINUE TO MANUFACTURE HERE BUT WE PUT IT OUT ON THE MARKET AND IT'S NOT AFFORDABLE FOR THE AVERAGE CONSUMER. AND THEN THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR ANYBODY AND SO THERE'S GONNA BE A BREAKING POINT AT SOME POINT. MEMBERS ANY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. I WOULD SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH -- TO THE THREE OF YOU -- WE'VE GOT ONE MISTER BLOOM THANK YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO ADD ADD A COMMENT -- WE WE TEND TO LOOK AT THESE ISSUES ARE OUR OWN EYES ITS THE YOU KNOW THE MOBILE PHONE THAT -- WE MIGHT NOT BY OR TO BE MORE EXPENSIVE FOR THE REFRIGERATOR THE CLOTHING -- AT AT THE STORE -- THE THESE ISSUES -- WILL HAVE A DRAMATIC IMPACT ON THOSE WHO ARE LIVING IN DEEP POVERTY -- AS WELL WE LEARNED TODAY -- THAT THE A LEVEL OF HOMELESSNESS AND LOSS AT THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY OF INCREASED FAIRLY DRAMATICALLY OVER THE PAST YEAR -- FOR THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE PAYING. MORE THAN A 50%. OF THEIR NET SPENDABLE INCOME ON THEIR HOUSING COSTS THEY HAVE THAT MUCH LESS TO PAY FOR THE STAPLES THAT THEY MIGHT BY AT THE LOCAL BODEGA OR RETAIL SHOP. THOSE BRICK AND MORTAR SHOPS THAT MIGHT NOW -- CLOSED DOWN AND BE FURTHER AWAY SO IT'S A LONGER DRIVE IT TAKES MORE GAS IT TAKES TIME AWAY. FROM WORK AND FAMILIES -- AND AND THESE FOLKS ARE ALREADY PAYING HIGHER PRICES BECAUSE THE PLACES WHERE THEY SHOP TYPICALLY ARE MORE EXPENSIE -- SO WHAT MIGHT SEEM -- A DEFERRAL OF A YOU KNOW A SOMETHING THAT I HAVE A CHOICE OVER -- HAS A RIPPLE EFFECT FOR THOSE WHO ARE LIVING IN AND DEEP POVERTY THAT IS FAR GREATER THAN WILL EVER IMPACT ANY OF US. IN OUR ONGOING LIVES AND I THINK WE SHOULDN'T LOSE SIGHT OF THE SAYS WERE HAVING THAT CONVERSATION [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER BERMAN THINK VERY MUCH PANELISTS. NEXT I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE AND WELCOME UP ON OUR COMFORT THE VICE PRESIDENT OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING OF THE WINE INSTITUTE. DAVE YEAH THE EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF WESTERN GROWERS ASSOCIATION AND MICHAEL YOUNG THE LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR THE CALIFORNIA. LABOR FEDERATION WELCOME TO THE THREE OF YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PATIENCE SO GLAD THAT YOU'RE ALL HERE. MS COMFORT IF YOU'D LIKE TO BEGIN YES THANK YOU I'M ON OUR COMFORT BUT THE ONE INSTITUTE ON THE VICE PRESIDENT OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN YOU TODAY AND TALK WITH YOU ABOUT SOMETHING THAT IS HAVING A DIRECT IMPACT ON OUR MEMBERS SO FIRST A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE ONE IS TO TO WE REPRESENTS -- OVER A THOUSAND WINERIES WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- WHICH REPRESENTS 80% OF CALIFORNIA'S WINE PRODUCTION. THE EXPORT ARM OF OUR BUSINESSES SIGNIFICANTLY IMPORTANT PART -- OF THE WINE INDUSTRY AND U. S. WINE EXPORT REACH JUST OVER ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT US WINE MORE THAN WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT CALIFORNIA. THE TERROR OF SUN CHINA HAVE BEEN A SIGNIFICANT DETERRENT. TO GROWTH AND ONE OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT MARKETS WELL CHINA RANKS FIFTH IN TERMS OF OUR TOTAL EXPORTS HAILS IT HAS BEEN THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET FOR CALIFORNIA WINE. WE'VE BEEN EXPORTING INTO CHINA FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS. AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT DEVELOPING EMERGING MARKETS DEVELOPING NEW ROUTES TO MARKET FOR OUR WINDS TAKES TIME. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE FREQUENTLY BUMPS IN THE ROAD AND HEAD WINDS AS WE DO THAT. HOWEVER THAT INVESTMENT OF TIME AND MONEY BY OUR MEMBERS TO DEVELOP THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT LEAD TO EFFECTIVE SALES OF CALIFORNIA WINE IN THESE MARKETS. IS HAS BEEN GREATLY HAMPERED. BY WHAT WE'RE SEEING GOING ON IN TRADE POLICY CURRENTLY. CHINA -- IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN REPRESENTED JUST OVER SIXTY JUST. UNDER SIXTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN EXPORTS AND COMBINED WITH HONG KONG ANOTHER A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION TO ALMOST TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN EXPORT. AT THE END OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE SAW THAT SALES GROWTH DECLINED BY 25%. WHEN WE LOOK AT THE FIRST QUARTER OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN OR SAYING THAT TRENDS CONTINUE AT ALMOST DOUBLE? SEVEN DECLINE ALMOST DOUBLE [inaudible] SOBERING -- AND WHAT'S SIGNIFICANT IN TERMS OF THAT DECLINE IS THE PRIOR TO THAT WE WERE SEEING CHINA AND HONG KONG TOGETHER. BEING ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING MARKETS THAT -- IN THE TIME THAT WE'VE BEEN EXPORTING HAD GROWN OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND 50%. IN GROWTH OVER THE PAST DECADE SO. A COMPLETE REVERSAL -- AS WE'RE GOING FORWARD AND I I JUST TOUCHED ON THE VALUE OF THE REVENUES OF EXPORT WINDS TO CHINA AND HONG KONG. AND THAT THAT GROWTH REPRESENTED OVERALL -- THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR DID AN EXCELLENT JOB OF WALKING THROUGH THE EVOLUTION OF TERRORISTS THAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE RECENT. TWO YEARS AND WHAT'S INTERESTING IS COMPARING THAT IS SHE TALKED ABOUT THE ACCUMULATION OF TERROR FROM TAX AGAINST GOODS WITHIN THE WINE INDUSTRY ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE OF COURSE ARE GOING HEAD TO HEAD. WITH COMPETITIVE WINE REGIONS. OF COURSE OUR FRIENDS OVER IN THE E. U. AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND AT CETERA. SOUTH AFRICA ABSOLUTELY AND SO IN THIS ENVIRONMENT -- WE ARE WE FIND OURSELVES PLAYING AND NOT ON AN EVEN A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD -- THE COMBINATION OF TERROR OF SIN TAXES -- THAT WE WERE DEALING WITH -- HAS NOW IT WOULD INCREASED UP TO A 93% ON TOP OF THE THE PRICE OF GOODS ALMOST DOUBLING THE COST OF CALIFORNIA WINE. INTO CHINA AND FOR OUR COMPETITIVE REGION'S THOSE REGIONS MANY OF THEM SO AUSTRALIA CHILE AND NEW ZEALAND IN PARTICULAR. THEY HAVE ZERO TARIFF THERE REALLY ONLY FACING -- TAX THAT LEADS 223%. WHEREAS FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION THERE ARE A TOTAL OF FORTY EIGHT POINT 6% SO WE ARE MORE THAN DOUBLE EVEN OUR CLOSEST COMPETITORS. SIMULTANEOUSLY WE'RE DEALING WITH AN ENVIRONMENT WHICH MANY OF OUR COMPETITIVE REGIONS HAVE SIGNIFICANT GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES SUPPORTING THEIR MARKETING EFFORTS INTO THOSE MARKETS. FOR EXAMPLE US WINE OPERATES AT JUST PARTICULARLY ITALY AND FRANCE FOR SUPPORTING THEIR MARKETING EFFORTS WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT RECEIVING TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. TO SUPPORT WINE EXPORT SALES COMPARED TO THE SIX MILLION DOLLARS THAT CALIFORNIA RECEIVES FROM THE FEDERAL AGRICULTURE SERVICE TO SUPPORT OUR SALES. SO IN LIGHT OF THAT. THE ADDITION OF THE TAX ENTIRE SITUATION IS PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING FOR US. AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF HOW THIS AFFECTS THE INDUSTRY IT DOESN'T CHEST FLOW. TO THE WINERY OWNERS OR THE WINERIES THEMSELVES AS IT WAS SO INTERESTING TO SIT AND LISTEN TO OUR COLLEAGUES -- IN THE FIRST PANEL I'M LOOKING AT MY COLLEAGUES ON THIS PANEL AND THAT THE WINE INDUSTRY IS UNIQUE IN THAT I SIT AND LINK ARMS AND PARTNER WITH EACH OF THEIR PARTNERS. THE PORTS COURSE THE RETAILERS TECHNOLOGY THE INVOLVEMENT OF TECHNOLOGY IN THE WINE INDUSTRY OF COURSE THE GROWERS AND LABOR. ARE KEY FACTORS WITHIN THE WINE INDUSTRY AND SO THE IMPACT OF THESE TEARS FLOW ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE WINE INDUSTRY IMPACTING. THE THE VINEYARD OWNERS AND THE GROWERS -- AT THE WINERY WORKERS THE SUPPLIERS THAT WE WORK WITH IN TERMS OF GLASS CORK SHIPPING LABEL PRODUCTION OF COURSE LABOR. THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF WINE AS A VALUE ADDED PRODUCT FAR EXCEEDS. JUST THE GROSS PRODUCTION OF WHAT WE DO. SO THESE IMPACTS ARE -- HAVE A HAVE A BIGGER FOOT PRINT. IT WITHIN THE MARKET AND HERE WITH IN CALIFORNIA. SIGNIFICANTLY THAT ALSO AS I MENTIONED IT TAKES TIME TO DEVELOP THESE MARKETS AS I MENTIONED WE'VE BEEN WORKING FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS TO CULTIVATE OUR SALES INTO CHINA IT ALSO TAKES TIME TO THEN REVERSE THE IMPACTS OF THESE TERRORISTS. IF THESE TERRORISTS WERE TO BE REMOVED TOMORROW. WHICH WOULD BE A BLESSING BUT WE KNOW A LONG SHOT. IT WOULD TAKE ANOTHER TEN PLUS YEARS TO REGAIN THE PLACEMENT IN THE SALES BACK INTO CHINA THE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE FIRST AND FOREMOST. IT'S BUILT ON RELATIONSHIPS CULTIVATING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE IMPORTERS THE AGENTS AND THE ACCOUNTS WHERE WE SELL OUR WINDS ONCE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS ARE DAMAGE THEY NEED TO BE REBUILT ALSO. THE PURCHASE OF WINE IS A CHOICE AND THERE'S A LOT OF CHOICE OUT THERE IN THE MARKET PLACE IT'S A CHOICE BY THE RETAILER OR THE IMPORTER WHO BRINGS AS WINDS IN IT'S A CHOICE BY THE CONSUMER. SO OF CALIFORNIA WINE IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE IS NO LONGER IN THAT SHELF SPACE THERE IS ANOTHER WINE THAT REPLACES THAT FACE THAT WINDS COMING FROM AUSTRALIA. NEW ZEALAND CHILE ITALY OR FRANCE. SO TO REGAIN THOSE POSITIONS THAT'S WHAT TAKES TIME. AND WE WOULD -- DURING THIS TIME OF THE TERRACE NOT ONLY ARE WE LOSING OUT ON THE OPPORTUNITY OF THE CURRENT SALES WERE LOSING OUT ON THE DEVELOPMENTAL OPPORTUNITY OF THAT MARKET OVER THE NEXT FIVE TEN FIFTEEN YEARS SO IN FACT AS AN INDUSTRY WERE LOSING TWICE. WE'RE LOOKING TO REPLACE THESE SALES BY DEVELOPING OTHER MARKETS WITHIN ASIA HOWEVER IT'S DIFFICULT TO REPLACE THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET. FOR OUR INDUSTRY. TODAY WE'RE FACING WITHIN THE WINE INDUSTRY OUR CHALLENGES AND HEAD WINDS ACROSS ALL OF OUR MAJOR MARKETS. ARE SINGLE LARGEST EXPORT MARKET IS THAT -- THAT YOU YOU AND YOU CAN. WITH THE THREAT OF TERRACE WITHIN THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY RETALIATORY TARIFFS THERE ALONG WITH BREXIT. THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL HAD ONE OUR SECOND AND SINGLE LARGEST SINGLE MARKET IS CANADA. AND THE IMPACT AND THREAT OF TEARS THAT WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH THEIR HONG KONG IS OUR THIRD LARGEST AND THE CHINA AS OUR FIFTH LARGEST AS I SAID. SO THIS IS -- A SITUATION WHERE THE IMPACTS ARE EXTENSIVE AND AND LASTING. AND ONE OF THE OTHER SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE IS THAT AS THE PRICE OF OUR GOODS INCREASES IN THE MARKET PLACE WE DO NOT HAVE THE OPTION TO PICK UP AND FIND SOURCING IN A MORE AFFORDABLE PLACE. WE CAN'T PICK UP OUR VINEYARDS AND OUR WINERIES AND MOVE THEM SOMEPLACE ELSE. UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE TO EITHER RAISE OUR PRICES OR CUT PRODUCTION WE HAVE TO CUT THE PRICES THAT WERE WILLING TO PAY TO OUR GROWERS. WE HAVE TO REDUCE THE THE PRODUCTION THAT WE HAVE OVERALL AND THERE FOR WE HIRE FEWER BOTTLING LINES WE REDUCE OUR CELLAR STAFF WE PURCHASED FEWER GOODS SO IT REALLY IS A TRICKLE DOWN THROUGH THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. THAT'S THE IMPACT THAT WE HAVE SO. WELL WE ARE TAKING THE LONG TERM VIEW. AND I'M BY NO MEANS ARE WE TURNING OUR BACK ON THIS MARKET WE'RE CONTINUING TO INVEST IN DEVELOPING THE PRESENTS FOR CALIFORNIA WINES BY PURSUING EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS. EDUCATING CONSUMERS AND TRADE HOSTING MASTER CLASSES INVITING TRADE DELEGATIONS HERE TO CALIFORNIA TO MEET OUR GROWERS TO MEET OUR WINE MAKERS TO CONTINUE TO CONVEY THE VALUE AND THE QUALITY IN THE CHARACTER OF CALIFORNIA WINES. WE ARE. ABSOLUTELY HOPEFUL THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO RESOLVE THIS QUICKLY SO THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD AND MOVE PAST THE SITUATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS COMFORT. THANK CHAIRMAN CHAIRWOMAN AND MEMBERS -- FOR ALLOWING US TO BE PART OF THIS HEARING TODAY IT'S VERY. GRATIFYING TO KNOW THERE'S SO MUCH ATTENTION BEING PAID TO THIS. I BECAUSE YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE IMPACTS THEY ARE VERY SERIOUS I WILL GO TOO MUCH FURTHER INTO THAT BECAUSE YOU'VE HAD SO MUCH GOOD DATA GIVEN YOU TODAY -- BUT I WILL TOUCH ON A FEW THINGS -- QUICKLY WESTERN GROWERS IS ORGANIZATION REPRESENTS FRESH PRODUCE INDUSTRY OUR GROWERS AND SHIPPERS IN FOUR STATES -- MOST OF THEM IN CALIFORNIA ALSO ARIZONA NEW MEXICO COLORADO. PRETTY ABOUT HALF THE NATION'S FRESH PRODUCE BOTH ORGANIC AND CONVENTIONAL OF THAT INCLUDES FRESH FRUITS VEGETABLES TREE NUTS -- SO YOU ALL HAVE TO SOME DEGREE OUR MEMBERS ARE DISTRICTS THANK YOU MISTER BLOOM AS A LITTLE BIT. I'M NOT MISTAKEN -- AND I I WILL SAY THIS YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA'S BLESSED AND CURSED IN SOME WAYS WITH THIS DIVERSITY OF AGRICULTURE WE HAVE OVER THREE HUNDRED CROPS -- A LOT OF SOME FARMERS OF DIFFERENT SIZE AND SCALE -- AND AS A RESULT YOU HAVE A LOT OF AG TRADE ASSOCIATIONS THAT YOU ALL HAVE TO DEAL WITH MANAGER ON THE SPECIALLY FOR YOU. AND ANY NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES COULD BEEN YOUR TODAY AND AND WOULD HAVE BEEN EQUALLY CAPABLE IN PROVIDING SOME INFORMATION SO -- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TO SIT IN THIS CHAIR ON ALL OF THEIR BEHALF. FOR THE MOMENT. DR SUMNER -- OUTLINED THE IMPACTS THAT WE'RE SEEING PRETTY CLEARLY -- THE HIS COLLEAGUES PRODUCED REPORT IN THE FALL THAT ESTIMATED THAT TO DATE THE DAMAGE FROM THE CHINESE -- RETALIATORY TARIFFS IS ABOUT THREE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS TO THE AG SECTOR. WHEN YOU PUT THAT UP AGAINST THE TWENTY POINT FIVE BILLION IN AG EXPORTS FROM CALIFORNIA TO CHINA EVERY YEAR YOU TALK ABOUT A PRETTY WHOPPING PERCENTAGE IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME SO -- THIS IS A SEVERE HIT TO THE INDUSTRY AND AND WHAT IT AS EVERYBODY'S ATTENTION -- I WANT TO TAKE OFF A COUPLE MORE NUMBERS THAN I WANT TO GET A LITTLE BIT INTO THE FEDERAL MITIGATION PROGRAM BECAUSE I THINK -- IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND WHERE IT CAN WORKING RIGHT IT PROBABLY CAN'T WORK AND THEN THAT GETS US INTO -- DESIRED OUTCOMES. SOME OF THE THE DATE I'M GONNA PRESENT COME FOR OUR FRIENDS IN THE ALMOND SECTOR THE ALLMAN LIGHTS CALIFORNIA AMERICA STATURE GROWERS. SOME OF MY OTHER COLLEAGUES SO WANT TO GIVE THE PROPER CREDIT -- I THINK WAS MENTIONED EARLIER ALMONDS EXPORT 67% OF THE CROP OUT OF CALIFORNIA. TERRACE OF ALREADY CAUSED A ONE THIRD REDUCTION. IN THOSE -- TONNAGE NUMBERS -- IN AUSTRALIA BY THE WAY WHICH DIDN'T HAVE A HUGE ALMOND. CAPABILITY PRODUCTION CAPABILITY IS INCREASING IT QUICKLY THEY HAVE NOW INCREASED THEIR EXPORTS OF ALMONDS TO CHINA BY NEARLY NOW THAT'S COMING FROM SMALL BASE BUT IT TELLS YOU -- WHERE THEIR EYES AND WHERE THEIR HEADS ARE POINTED AND THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES -- ALMOND TERRACE ARE NOW 50% ON BALK -- PRODUCT 20% ON PROCESSED OR CANNED PRODUCT. OPPOSITE THAT SHOWS BY THE WAY WAS MENTIONED EARLIER -- BY DOCTOR SUNDAR THAT BECAUSE IRAN HAD A FAILED CROP LAST YEAR OUR PISTACIA REYES LARGELY DODGED -- THE IMPACTS FROM THE TERRACE I AND I THINK HE WAS VERY -- APPROPRIATE IN IN NOTING THAT THAT IS NOT SOMETHING WE CAN COUNT ON THE TERRACE OF STASHES ARE NOW 45%. AND THAT WAS AT 5% PRIOR. SO THEY'RE IN HARM'S WAY -- I MENTION PECANS ALSO WE DO HAVE A LOT OF A CONTRADICTION IN CALIFORNIA BUT WE DO IN THE WEST IT STARTED IT'S A GROWTH INDUSTRY AND IN THAT SECTOR IN THE WEST A WESTERN PART OF THE U. S. -- THERE THE TERRACE AND GOT UP 2403% FROM I BELIEVE IT WAS A 47% I BELIEVE FROM SEVEN THEY'VE SEEN YEAR OVER YEAR. PRICES DROP BY 43% -- SO WE JUST SEE THIS THIS ACCUMULATION OF PRODUCT NOW WITH NO WHERE TO PARK IT -- AND THAT GOES. TO WITHIN THE DIVERSE ARRAY OF CALIFORNIA FARM PRODUCTS. I IT IS THE PERMANENT CROP PRODUCERS WHO ARE REALLY IN TROUBLE HERE IF THIS CONTINUES. ARE THEY CAN'T TURN THE TREES OFF THE CAN'T TURN THE VINES OFF THEY'RE GOING TO PRODUCE THAT. CROP AND YOU GOT TO FIND SOME PLACE TO PUT IT -- I WILL SAY THIS. THIS IS RESOLVING THE SATISFACTORILY IT IS OF COURSE CRITICAL FOR PERMANENT CROP FARMERS. BUT IT'S JUST AS CRITICAL FOR EVERY OTHER FARMING CALIFORNIA BECAUSE EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE LIKE ALMONDS EVERYBODY WANTS TO FIND THAT -- MARKET IN CHINA AND ELSEWHERE IN ASIA TO BE ABLE TO EXPORT AND ARE GET THE RETURNS THAT THE ALLMAN SECTOR AND STASHES SECTOR OF GOTTEN. IN CHINA SO THAT GETS ME INTO A QUICK DISCUSSION ABOUT THE USDA MITIGATION PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN INITIATED THE FIRST WAS ANNOUNCED LAST YEAR AT TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS WAS LATER SCALED BACK TO ABOUT. TEN BILLION DOLLARS AND WAS NOTED EARLIER. BY OTHERS -- THAT PRIMARILY WENT TO MIDWESTERN SOYBEAN CORN WHEAT PRODUCERS PORK -- PRODUCERS A LITTLE BIT CAME TO OUR ALMOND -- IN THAT PRISON CALIFORNIA BUT NOT VERY MUCH. THE SECOND TRYING TO THE SECOND PROGRAM JUST ANNOUNCED. A BY THE ADMINISTRATION IS SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS -- WITH FOURTEEN POINT FIVE BILLION GOING TO MARKET FACILITATION WHICH IS ANOTHER WAY OF SAY THE SAME PURCHASING SURPLUS PRODUCT -- THERE AGAIN WE EXPECT THAT'S GOING TO LARGELY GO TO THE MIDWEST BUT THERE IS A BIT OF A RECOGNITION IN THIS PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE ADDITIONAL CROPS IN CALIFORNIA AND PRODUCERS IN CALIFORNIA WATER OF ACCESS TO THOSE FUNDS. AS THEY EXPANDED IT BEYOND -- ALMOST TO INCLUDE PISTACHIOS CHERRIES ARE INVOLVED. I AND SOME OTHER SOME OTHER -- BERMAN CROPS AS WELL SUCH AS TABLE GRAPES. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THERE IS OF COURSE -- THAT. IN THE FRESH PRODUCE SECTOR IN THE UNITED STATES WE'VE NEVER HAD DIRECT PAYMENTS SUBSIDIES FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVE NEVER WANTED THEM. FOR VARIOUS REASONS WILL SEE HAVING TO DO WITH THE STIFLING EFFECT THAT SUBSIDIES HAVE ON INNOVATION ON COMPETITION MARKET SIGNALS THAT -- MY MEMBERS APPRECIATE MORE THAN THEY DO SUBSIDIES. AND AS DOCTOR SUMMER NOTED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT JUST ISN'T -- CONSTRUCTED ISN'T BUILT TO MOVE DIRECT PAYMENTS TO FRESH PRODUCE GROWERS. IN AN EFFICIENT WAY SO WE DON'T KNOW HOW WELL THIS IS GOING TO ROLL OUT WE DO KNOW THAT -- FARMERS IN THE MIDWEST TO ARE USED -- TO AND HAVE THAT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE USDA. ARE GOING TO BE ACCESSING THE PROGRAM QUICKLY SO WE'RE TRYING TO HUSTLE -- THROUGH THE PROCESS TO MAKE SURE MEMBERS ARE IN POSITION TO BE ABLE. TO PUT IN A CLAIM FOR AS MUCH AS THEY CAN OFFSET. SOME OF THEIR LOST THEIR LOST MARKET [inaudible] BUT WHAT WAS -- REALLY CRITICALLY STATED EARLIER IS THAT WE DON'T WANT. THOSE DIRECT PAYMENTS WE NEED THIS TO END WE NEED TO GET BACK TO WHAT WE DO BEST WHICH IS PRODUCING THE BEST PRODUCTS IN THE WORLD. AND MARKETING THEM ACROSS THE WORLD TO PEOPLE WHO WHO WANT THE MEN OF SHOWN THAT. IN THEIR IN THEIR PURCHASING DECISIONS -- REALLY CRITICAL POINT FOR THE OUTCOME HERE YET AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT -- HOW WE GET TO AN OUTCOME WHETHER IT'S IT'S ONE SIDED THERE BLINKING IN THIS TERRIBLE GAME OF CHICKEN OR WE GO BACK TO A WTO TYPE PROCESS? ABOVE MY PAY GRADE BUT ONE VERY IMPORTANT POINT WE ONE OF HIS EYES IS THAT WHEN THIS IS RESOLVED. FOR THE PRODUCE SECTOR. IN CALIFORNIA IN THE WEST PARTICULARLY WE CAN'T JUST RETURN THE STATUS QUO ANTE. WE HAD SUFFERED HAVE SUFFERED FOR YEARS DESPITE SOME SUCCESS WITH. ALMONDS AND PISTACHIOS OTHER PRODUCTS WINE CERTAINLY MOVING INTO CHINA FRESH PRODUCE COMMODITIES HAVE BEEN HIT WITH NON TARIFF BARRIERS. AROUND THE WORLD IN CHINA HAS BEEN NO EXCEPTION -- PARTICULARLY -- ALLEGED -- THREATS THAT OUR PRODUCTS COMING IN OUR FRESH PRODUCTS COMING TO CHINA CONTAIN A BUG OR A DISEASE. THAT THEN GIVE THEM JUSTIFICATION UNDER WTO RULES RULES TO THROW UP THE WALLS AND KEEP OUR PRODUCT OUT AND PROTECT THEIR DOMESTIC PRODUCERS -- IN AN UNFAIR MANNER WE CHALLENGES ALL THE TIME IS AN INDUSTRY BUT CHINA HAS NOT BEEN RESPONSIVE TO THE NORMAL. A GIVE AND TAKE IN IN IN THE WTO PROCESS OF RESOLVING THIS LAUNCHER CARE OF TRADE BARRIERS AND SO WE NEED STRONGER PROTECTIONS. AROUND SANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY NON TARIFF TRADE BARRIERS THAT HAVE BEEN -- USED TO KEEP AMERICAN PRODUCT OUT OF A CHINA IN THE PAST AND BY THE WAY THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS WE CALLED FOR IN THE IN THE NAFTA TWO POINT OVER THE U. S. M. C. A. AGREEMENT WE SEE SOME IMPROVEMENTS IN THE SANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY. PROTOCOLS THERE SO -- REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DON'T JUST GO BACK TO STATUS QUO ANTE. ONE OTHER POINT TO MAKE AND THEN AND AND THEN ALL ALL STOP IS THAT -- AS OTHERS HAVE SAID EARLIER. THE DANGER HERE IS THAT OTHERS ARE SEEKING TO REPLACE OUR MARKETS. I MENTION AUSTRALIAN ALMOND PRODUCERS WHO ARE NOW. UPPING THEIR THEIR EXPORTS TO CHINA IT'S NOT LIMITED TO THEM. IT'S EVERY COMMODITY THAT WE CURRENTLY -- ARE ABLE TO PUT INTO THE CHINESE MARKET PLACE AND IT'S COMING FROM AROUND THE WORLD. IN THIS DEBATE IT WITHIN THE AG INDUSTRY AND IT'S PROJECTION OF OF OF PRIORITIES TO THE ADMINISTRATION IT'S REALLY THE MIDWESTERN FARMERS ARE DRIVING THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE MORE EASILY REPLACEABLE IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT SOYBEANS CORN WHEAT CAN BE PRODUCED A LOT OF PLACES IN THE WORLD. ALMONDS PISTACHIOS FAR FEWER PLACES IN THE WORLD. BUT THE POINT I MADE EARLIER APPLIES EVEN MORE. EVERY GROWING CALIFORNIA -- STRAWBERRIES SALARY -- FIND RAM TOMATOES BROCCOLI GO DOWN A LIST -- BERRIES THEY ALL WANT TO BE ABLE TO EXPORT AND THEY ALL THINK THEY CAN AND THEY PROBABLY CAN'T GIVEN A FAIR SHOT. AND SO WE CAN'T ALLOW. AS THIS IS RESOLVED THE MIDWESTERN CROP PRODUCERS TO DOMINATE THE OUTCOME TO SET THE PROTOCOLS GOING FORWARD FOR WHAT THIS NEW TRADE RELATIONSHIP LOOKS LIKE HOWEVER WE GET OVER THAT FINISH LINE THERE HAS TO BE. A PRODUCE SECTOR AND A WEST COAST. IMPRINT ON THE RESOLUTION OF THIS DISPUTE OR THIS WAR -- FINALLY I CAN'T EMPHASIZE THIS ENOUGH. OTHERS HAVE SAID IT QUITE WELL A WE CAN'T. WE CAN'T TOLERATE THIS THAT MUCH LONGER -- OUR PRESIDENT WESTERN GROWERS AMBASSADOR TOM MASSIVE WROTE -- QUITE PLAINLY SOMETIME AGO. THAT WHILE WE UNDERSTAND THE GOAL TO FORGE NEW AND FAIR TRADE AGREEMENTS PARTICULARLY WITH CHINA. THOSE AGREEMENTS WILL ONLY BENEFIT AMERICAN FARMERS IF THEY HAVEN'T PERMALINK LOST THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH FOREIGN BUYERS AND THAT IS HAPPENING NOW IN ANY ROAD IN OTHER WORDS WE NEED THIS ADMINISTRATION DRIVE THIS PROCESS TO CONCLUSION QUICKLY. GRAB QUICKLY UNDERLINED SIX TIMES WERE WERE WERE RUNNING OUT OF TIME FOR FOR MANY OF OUR PRODUCERS I'M AFRAID. BOB WANNA MAKE MISTER CHAIRMAN -- CHAIRMAN EGGMAN MADE THIS POINT ANOTHER WAY CALIFORNIA'S BEEN BLESSED TO HAVE AS I SAID EARLIER THIS DIVERSITY OF FARMERS OF ALL SIZES PRODUCING OVER THREE HUNDRED DIFFERENT PRODUCTS. BUT WE'VE SEEN A MOVEMENT TO CONSOLIDATION WE'VE SEEN THE LARGER PLAYERS WHO CAN WITHSTAND HIGHER COSTS OF PRODUCTION THAT ARE UNIQUE TO CALIFORNIA. ABSORB THOSE SMALLER FARMS -- CALIFORNIA ALREADY REQUIRES HIGHER PRODUCTION COSTS TO KEEP A CAL POLY SANDERS OBISPO STAY RECENTLY SHOWED THAT FOR A LETTUCE PRODUCER IN SALINAS -- IN TWO THOUSAND SIX REGULATORY COSTS WERE A HUNDRED NINE DOLLARS PER ACRE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN NOW 900-77 DOLLARS PER ACRE. YOU LOAD THAT ON TOP OF THE IMPACTS WE NOW HAVE A FROM THE TERROR FOR AND YOUR I'M AFRAID WE'RE GONNA SEE MORE CONSOLIDATION. MORE LOSS OF SMALL FARMERS WHO CAN'T -- STRETCH THEIR THEIR THEIR FINANCING CAPABILITIES THROUGH THIS THROUGH THIS WAR. SO IF THERE IS A AN ABILITY OF THE OF THIS BODY TO LOOK AT THAT REGULATORY DISPARITIES THAT IS UNIQUE TO CALIFORNIA FARMERS. A RELATIVE TO THOSE WE COMPETE AGAINST OTHER STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES NOW IS THE TIME BECAUSE THE THE COSTS THAT ARE NOW FLOATING ON TOP OF THOSE REGULATORY COSTS. ARE BRIAN BE UNBEARABLE FOR THE SMALLER FARMERS WERE TRYING TO TRY TO PROTECT. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS A MISTER YOUNG. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THAT MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS -- MICHAEL YOUNG WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION REPRESENT -- ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED UNIONS ACROSS THE STATE AND THAT INCLUDES ABOUT TWO POINT ONE MILLION -- UNION MEMBERS -- AS YOU CAN IMAGINE WE COME AT THIS ISSUE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY -- WITH OUR PRIMARY -- FOCUS EING THAT OF LABOR WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILY AND ALSO CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT UNDERSTAND THE LAST PANELIST ON A LONG DAY OUT -- KEEP MY COMMENTS -- A BRIEF -- THE THE THE AFL IS MAINTAINED FOR MANY YEARS AND FOR MANY ADMINISTRATIONS THAT -- TERRORISTS ARE IMPORTANT TERRACE ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF ENFORCEMENT -- IF YOU VIOLATE THE RULES YOU SHOULD FACE CONSEQUENCES ONE OF CONSEQUENCES CAN BE TERRACE HOWEVER -- TEARS NEED TO BE TARGETED AND NOT WIDELY CASTS WITHOUT ANY PLAN OR STRATEGY AROUND THEM -- RIGHT NOW -- IT OUR TRADE RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA IS BEING USED BY A HANDFUL OF BANKS CORPORATIONS TO WHOLE WAGES DOWN -- IN BOTH COUNTRIES AND CREATE AN UNTENABLE A TRADE DEFICIT IN THE UNITED STATES AND I THINK WE'RE GONNA AT THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE IMPACT OF OF OF THE CHINESE HERE THE TERRACE ON CHINA -- HAS TO BE LOOK MORE BROADLY AT IN CONSIDERING THE THE THE THE GROWING GET CHINA THAT ARE GROWING TRADE DEFICIT. WITH CHINA AS WILL -- THE GROWTH OF THE US TRADE DEFICIT WITH CHINA -- HAS INCREASED BY WELL OVER A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS -- SINCE THE GREAT RECESSION -- PLAYING A LARGE ROLE IN MY MANUFACTURING EMPLOYMENT HASN'T FULLY RETURN DESPITE THE GROWTH OF THE ECONOMY OVER THAT TIME FRAME -- THE GROWING TRADE DEFICIT HAS -- RESULT IN JOB LOSSES IN EVERY STATE IN THE COUNTRY AND EVERYTHING GRUSHOW DISTRICT -- OF THE TOP TEN THE HARDEST HIT STATES -- WHEN LOOKING AT JOB LOSSES THE SHARE OF TOTAL STATE EMPLOYMENT CALIFORNIA'S THIRD -- AND OF THE FIVE PARTIES TO STATES BASED ON JOB ALL OF THE TOTAL JOB LOSS CALIFORNIA IS THE FIRST TO WITH ABOUT -- FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO THOUSAND JOBS LOST SINCE -- TWO THOUSAND ONE IN ORDER TO START FIXING -- THE STATE WAGE GROWTH AND JOB LOSSES CREATED OR THAT'S BEEN THE CALLS BY THIS -- GROWING DEFICIT ANY TRADE TALKS IN CHINA -- SHOULD INCLUDE TWO PRINCIPLES AND ONE OF THOSE IS THAT IT IS CONCLUDE A MULTILATERAL APPROACH -- THEIR STRENGTH IS OUR ALLIES TO MAXIMIZE OUR LEVERAGE -- AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE -- AND SICK IN. WHAT THE US CAN RECOGNIZE CHINA'S RIGHT TO DEVELOP ITS ECONOMY IS A BUT? WE HAVE TO BE CLEAR THAT CHINA CAN'T BE ALLOWED TO DO SO IN A WAY THAT UNDERMINES LABOR RIGHTS AND DESABILIZE OTHER ECONOMIES THAT MEANS DRESSING LABOR AND HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS -- TARIFFS ARE. ARTS EXCUSE ME ARTS AN ANGLE -- BUT THEY CAN BE AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO ENTRY PRACTICES THAT KILL AMERICAN JOBS AND DRIVE AMERICAN WAGES DOWN -- HOWEVER OVERALL THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ST PRACTICES HAVE YOU ADDED. AN IMBALANCE -- THIS HERE FOR CHINA IT JUST IT JUST ISN'T WORKING AND IT WON'T -- SO LONG AS THE KEY GOAL TO PROTECT PROFITS IN STORY INSTEAD OF JOBS AND THE RIGHTS OF WORKING PEOPLE -- THE US IS FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY ENFORCE A EXISTING RULES IS WHY THEY'RE SO MUCH PENT UP FRUSTRATION AMONG MANY WORKERS AND DOMESTIC PRODUCERS OVER TRADE WITH CHINA -- OUR TRADE ENFORCEMENT MEASURES SHOULD PRIORITIZE THINGS LIKE LIKE GOOD JOBS WORKERS RIGHTS DEMOCRACY ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE CONSUMER SAFETY PROTECTIONS. OVER OUTSOURCING OR EVEN SHORT TERM PROFITS -- WE NEED LONG TERM ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES THEY USE DOMESTIC TAX INFRASTRUCTURE WORKPLACE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT POLICIES TO ENSURE THAT AMERICAN WORKERS AND BUSINESSES HAVE THE TOOLS AND SKILLS THEY NEED TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY IN -- BUT THE GOVERNMENT ALSO NEEDS TO STRENGTH ARCHERY COMPLIANCE -- ENFORCEMENT MEASURES ENFORCER MEASURES AND BE WILLING TO USE THEM AGGRESSIVELY CONSISTENTLY BUT MOST IMPORTANT STRATEGICALLY -- TO ENSURE THAT OUR TRADE RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA IS RECIPROCAL AND THEIR AND AMERICAN WORKERS AND FAMILIES CONCEDE PROTECTED SO THANK YOU. MISTER YOUNG THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M NOT TRYING TO TAKE A POLL FROM THE THREE OF YOU AND YOU KNOW MS MITCHELL IF YOU WANT TO JOIN SINCE YOU'RE FROM THE LAST COUNT THE WANT LAST PERSON STANDING FROM THERE. WITH SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WE MIGHT HAVE BECAUSE I THINK THAT WE'VE GOT SOME THINGS THAT MIGHT BE TRAMAINE FOR YOU AS WELL. YES YOU READ THERE FOR YOU -- I I'M NOT TRYING TO TAKE A POLL YOU DON'T NEED TO SAY WHERE YOU'RE INDUSTRY GROUPS STOOD ON THE TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP BUT T. P. P.. COULD HAVE SET SOME GROUND RULES AND A FRAMEWORK FOR HOW TRADE WORKED BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND A GREAT DEAL OF ASIA INCLUDING CHINA. THE UNITED STATES RETREATED FROM T. P. P. ALLOWING CHINA TO DICTATE TRADE MORE AGGRESSIVELY THAN UNITED STATES DID BY CREATING A FRAMEWORK WITH OTHER COUNTRIES. LEAVING UNITED STATES OUT. AND THIS IS A NEGOTIATING TACTIC THAT IS FAVORED BY -- PRESIDENT TRUMP TO NEGOTIATE ONE ON ONE RATHER THAN -- IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OTHER COUNTRIES. DO YOU THINK TPP WOULD HAVE -- HELP CALIFORNIA AND OF COURSE UNITED STATES AVOID THE CURRENT -- QUAGMIRE. ANYONE WANNA GO FIRST ON THAT. ONE I'LL BE HAPPY TO SAY HERE. TPP AT THE NO LONGER BEING PUT IN T. B. PAY HAS HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT FOR CALIFORNIA WINE EXPORTS SO THAT JAPAN IS THE FOURTH. LARGEST EXPORT MARKET FOR US IT'S VERY STABLE MATURE MARKET IT'S ALSO VERY HIGH VALUE. IN THAT I'M WHERE ABLE TO EXPORT WIND ALL UP AND DOWN THE PRICE SCALE SO IT'S IT'S SIGNIFICANT IMPORTANT TO US -- OF COURSE OUR LARGEST COMPETITIVE WINE REGIONS ARE TRADING ARE ERIN A FREE TRADE -- OR AS A ZERO IMPACT -- RELATIONSHIP WITH JAPAN WHERE AS WE OF COURSE ARE NOT IN THAT POSITION SO -- WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN GET BACK TO FREE TRADE AGREEMENT WITH JAPAN BUT IT ABSOLUTELY HAS HAD AN IMPACT FOR THE WINE INDUSTRY. AND I'M THAT COUPLED WITH THE CURRENT SITUATION IN CHINA HAS JUST TAKEN THAT ENTIRE REGION AND CREATED HEADWINDS THAT HAVE. SLOWED OUR DEVELOPMENT. IN THE PROCESS OF TV MISTER WHO IS CHAIRMAN I WE SUPPORT THE TPP -- PREFER THAT IT WOULD HAVE HELD TOGETHER. I'M HAVING SAID THAT RELATIVE TO AGRICULTURE AT LEAST A FRESH PRODUCE SECTOR -- WE HAVE SEEN SOME POSITIVE BILATERAL AGREEMENTS EITHER THE KERR OR TAKE SHAPE THE KOREAN BILATERAL BY FOR SURE WAS HELPFUL -- WE'RE GETTING A GOOD VIBES ON THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH JAPAN WE'LL SEE -- BUT CLEARLY MORE EFFICIENT WAY TO DO THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN THIRTY BEEPING FOR THAT [inaudible] THIS YOUNG. YES THE AT FILL IT UP POSTED CPP AND I THINK IT FEELS INCLUDE -- SIGNIFICANT WORK PROTECTIONS THAT THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE IMPORTANT -- PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE IMPACT OF FAILING TO DO SO AND PREVIOUS TRADE DEALS INCLUDING NAFTA AND ITS IMPACT IN THE MIDWEST -- I THINK THEY WERE STRONG HESITATION FROM -- WORKERS AND UNIONS -- TO SUPPORT ON THE MOVING FORWARD AGAIN DIDN'T HAVE A STRONG FORCE A MECHANISM FOR THE LACK OF LABOR. IN OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE GLOBALLY -- MISS MITCHELL JONAH SO MISTER YOUNG ON PERHAPS MAYBE WITH ANOTHER PRESIDENT SOME OF THE PROTECTIONS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR WOULD HAVE BEEN IN PLACE THE TPP DID NOT INCLUDE AT THE TIME -- DO YOU SEE THAT PLAYING OUT IN THE THE UNIT DODD. BILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS THAT ARE TAKING PLACE WITH COUNTRIES. ORDER NOW THEY'RE NOT PART OF THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE IT PRESIDENT IS NOT. AS FOCUSED OR OR PERHAPS HE IS. DO YOU MEAN THE BILATERAL CONVERSATIONS WITH WHAT'S RIGHT. ALL THE OTHER COUNTRIES YOU KNOW THE ONE ON ONE CONVERSATIONS. OUR OUR LABOR CONCERNS THAT WERE WERE VALID ON ON TPP CRITICISM YOU KNOW BEING PRESENT IN THOSE NEGOTIATIONS. I MEAN WE HOPEFULLY IN THE NEXT ADMINISTRATION THAT THAT WOULD BE THE CASE I I I DON'T THINK. OUR CONCERNS WHO ARE BEING CARRIED OUT IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS. AGAIN I I THINK WE HAVE A VERY -- DEMOCRATIC PRICES MOVING FORWARD AND I THINK -- WORKERS MORE AND MORE ARE UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACT OF THESE TRADE AGREEMENTS ON THEIR ABILITY TO WORK RIGHT SO -- YEAH I I WANNA STREET TO FAR AWAY FROM THAT A BILLS POSITION ON THIS BUT I I I THINK -- AGAIN I THINK THE THE THE FOCUS BEING ON SOME OF FORCE A MECHANISM -- TO WORKER PROTECTIONS AND A BEER APPROACH TO HOW -- TRADE IS GOING TO BE APPROACH INSTEAD OF JUST LOOKING AT IT AS A FREE AND COST APPROACH IT IS PROBABLY BEST IT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TERRORISTS THAT HAVE BEEN IMPOSED BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND THEN OF COURSE THE THE RETALIATORY TERRORIST DO YOU BELIEVE THAT. SOME OF THIS ACTIVITY ON THE UNITED STATES PART WILL LEAD TO MORE JOB GROWTH IN CREATION IN THE UNITED STATES -- THAT WOULD BE YOU KNOW PERHAPS -- DESPITE THE RETALIATORY -- NATURE BECAUSE MANY SECTION MAY LEAVE CHINA MAY CREATE JOBS HERE IN UNITED STATES. I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW AND I DON'T I THINK IT'S PROBABLY TOO EARLY TO SAY I THINK -- I THINK THE TRUMPS -- APPROACH TO THE THE TEARS CHINA JUST DOESN'T AGAIN SEEM TO HAVE ANY SORT OF STRATEGY -- GOAL WHICH CAN BE HARMFUL TO WORKERS HERE -- SO I THINK THE I THINK THERE IS A UNIVERSAL GOAL OF HAVING THESE ISSUES RESOLVED -- QUICKLY BUT I THINK MORE BROADLY -- OUTSIDE OF THE CAN GET THE SPECIFIC TERRACE AGAINST CHINA I THINK LABOR MOVEMENT HAS SUPPORTED TERRORISTS THAT OUR STRATEGIC IN YOUR OWN SCOPE. AT THAT ARE CONNECTED TO A STRATEGIC GOAL AND LACKING THAT HERE -- CREATE SOME HARMFUL TRICKLE DOWN EFFECT STAY AT THE BUSINESSES BUT ALSO IN FACT -- WORKERS -- WAGES BUT ALSO THEIR ABILITY -- TO BY SOME PRODUCTS YEAH I THINK YOU MISTER YOUNG. MISTER COULD YOU TALKABOUT THE SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN SUBSIDIES. WE WE'VE HEARD THAT PICKED A CRITICISM FROM CALIFORNIA'S PERSPECTIVE A LOT OF THAT WILL GO TO THE MIDWEST HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK WILL MAKE IT TO THE CALIFORNIA MARKET. IT'S A GREAT QUESTION -- I DON'T KNOW A LOT OF THIS DEPENDS ON HOW MANY OF OUR FARMERS GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF APPLICATION AND GET TIMELY RESPONSE FROM USDA AGAIN THE MECHANISMS AREN'T REALLY THERE WERE CREATING THEM ON THE FLY. I WILL SAY THE SECOND PROGRAM SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM MADE ONE CRITICAL PROVEN THAT OVER THE FIRST. ONE THE FIRST ONE HAD AN ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME THRESHOLD OF I BELIEVE IT'S NINE OR THOUSAND DOLLARS ABOVE WHICH YOU COULD NOT APPLY FOR CALIFORNIA WE HAVE -- PHARMACISTS AGI TENDS TO BE THERE OR MAYBE A LITTLE HIGHER BECAUSE WE HAVE LARGER OPERATIONS IN MULTIPLE PARTS OF THE STATE. SO THEY DID AWAY WITH THAT AGI THRESHOLD THAT SHOULD HELP US BUT I CAN'T GIVE YOU A GOOD ESTIMATE. THEY BY THE WAY ON THAT SIXTEEN BILLION THE ADMINISTRATION TENDS TO ROLL THAT OUT IN THREE TRANCHES. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT COME MAYBE INTO TRASHES OR OR -- ONE NOT STRETCH IT OUT. MEMBERS HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS AT THIS POINT -- ANY CLOSING Â DON'T USUALLY DO CLOSING CONCERT ANY ANY DID NOT GET A CHANCE TO SAY SOMETHING THAT YOU WANTED TO SAY I'M JUST GRATEFUL THAT YOU GUYS LASTED THAT YOU HAVE WE'RE WE CARE A LOT ABOUT. YOUR YOUR MEMBERS AND THE IMPACTS ON ALIFORNIA AND IN SO WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT YOU PARTICIPATED AS WITH THE OTHER PANELISTS AS WELL -- SO THANK YOU FOR THAT -- MADAM CULTURED ANY MARKS THE LET'S SAY. IT ALSO JUST SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AT THAT YOU KNOW OF COURSE AND WE'RE ALL SITTING HERE REFLECTING AND NOBODY'S GOT THE COURSE OF OUR LIKE HOW LONG CAN YOU LAST. RIGHT AND EVEN IF RATE WE WEATHER THE STORM FOR AWHILE HOW HOW DO WE TRUST AND THAT ANOTHER CORPORATE WON'T GET. TUGGED -- WHICH I THINK AGAIN JUST ADDS TO THE UNCERTAINTY THAT DATA THAT IS THE THE BANE OF BUSINESS. WE'RE GOING TO GO TO WAY OUT PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD -- AS WE MOVE THE PUCK THANK YOU AGAIN -- PALACE AS BEAUTIFUL A COMMENT AYE AYE SHOULD STATED AT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE HEARING -- THAT WE DID INVITE -- THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA TO PARTICIPATE AND THAT WE DID NOT GET A RESPONSE. DAY OUT WE DID INVITE THE US TRADE REPRESENTATIVE -- TO PARTICIPATE AS WELL SO THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION AS WELL -- THIS AT A DOCTOR EGGMAN -- THIS IS IMPORTANT TO HEAR FROM THEM BUT WE DIDN'T GET A RESPONSE IN ADDITION -- ART WILL GO TO THE MICROPHONE PLEASE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY NAME IS HEALING TREVINO I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE ALMOND ALLIANCE THANK YOU. FOR EXPORT. THE LARGEST EXPERIENCE I HAD A CAT I HAD TO SAY SOMETHING RIGHT AND BE REMISS NOT TO AND MR PROBABLY AT STILL MUST MOST OF THE THUNDER SO THANK YOU DAY THANK YOU. FOR HELPING ME OUT BUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS I JUST WANT TO TOUCH ON ESPECIALLY PERTAINING TO YOU KNOW THE QUESTION WHAT CAN THE LEGISLATURE DO IT COME THE MINISTRATION DO -- AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT SO TRY TO BE QUICK -- AND I JUST WANNA DO SOME HIGHLIGHTS HERE YOU KNOW WE WE GENERATE ABOUT A HUNDRED FOUR THOUSAND JOBS STATEWIDE 97% NINETY SEVEN THOUSAND OF THOSE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY ESPECIALLY IN. HIGH A CHRONIC UNEMPLOYMENT AREAS SO THAT SIGNIFICANT WOULD GENERATE ABOUT TWENTY ONE BILLION IN THE ECONOMIC REVENUE DIRECTLY ELEVEN BILLION TO THE STATE'S TOTAL ECONOMY -- THIS LAST YEAR AUCTION TWENTY SEVENTEEN OUR EXPORTS WERE VALUED AT ABOUT FOUR POINT FIVE BILLION -- WHICH SUBSTANTIALLY CONTRIBUTES THE AGRICULTURAL TRADE SURPLUS -- OBVIOUSLY WERE THE TOP THREE ONE OF THE TOP THREE VALUED COMMODITIES -- IT WE WORST TARGETED IN -- TWENTY EIGHTEEN APRIL SECOND -- WITH THE TWO THIRTY TWOS AND SO IT'S JUST NOT TRYING TO FOR US BUT TURKEY BUT 25% IS NOT CHANGED AND TARGETS A SIGNIFICANT MARKET IT'S NOT OUR LARGEST BUT IT'S A SIGNIFICANT -- SO THIS PROLONGED TRADE DISPUTE IS HURT -- THE INDUSTRY. DAVID MENTIONED SOME NUMBERS I WON'T REPEAT THEM -- I DO WANT TO SAY THAT IF YOU LOOK SPECIFICALLY AT DIRECT CHINA SHIPMENTS -- WHICH WE HAVE ARGUED WITH THE U. S. T. ECONOMIST IN TERMS OF HONG KONG CHINA BUT THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT DISCUSSION -- WE'RE LOOKING AT THE FIRST QUARTER OF TWENTY NINETEEN WERE ABOUT 60% OF WHAT WE SHIPPED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO THAT'S A SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE -- AS AS I'M WAS INDICATED TO MEANWHILE AUSTRALIA AS STRONG AS LOOKING OVER THAT ELEVEN MONTH. SAME TERM ABOUT INCREASE OF BECAUSE AUSTRALIA IS ACTUALLY MOVING ITS EXPORTS INTO OTHER COUNTRIES INTO CHINA. BECAUSE WHEN THEY KNOW THAT THERE IS A RESOLUTION THEY WANT TO SATURATE THAT MARKET AND WHEN THEY KNOW THAT -- OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS WE'VE INVESTED SEVENTY FOUR MILLION IN THAT MARKET IN CHINA TO OPEN AND EXPAND THAT MARKET AND THEY ARE TAKING THEM VERY GOOD ADVANTAGE OF THAT WAS THE WTO AGREEMENT -- SO IN CLOSING I WANT TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE INTERESTED IN TRADING MARKET GROWTH WE'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN DC. I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE AREAS I WANT TO FOCUS ON YOU KNOW I GO TO THESE TRADE EVENTS THESE DISCUSSIONS -- WITH THE SECRETARY WITH ADMINISTRATION AND WITH OMB AND YOU JUST SEE THE MIDWEST PRESENCE. YOU SEE CALIFORNIA'S PRESENCE IT GOES BACK TO YOU IN THE DAY WHEN I WORKED IN THE ADMINISTRATION YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THREE OR FOUR LOBBYIST. FOR STATE THIS BIG. AND IT JUST INFURIATES YOU ASIDE FROM THE DAY IN THE GOOD OLD DAYS AND WE HAD TRADING COMMERCE REPS IN KEY MARKETS. AND I I WOULD HOPE THAT AS SOME DAY SOMEDAY SOON THAT WE RE EXAMINE NOT ESPECIALLY NOT JUST AN AGRICULTURE FROM SELFISH PERSPECTIVE. BUT JUST HOW MUCH THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY IS IMPORTANT TO CALIFORNIA SO LOOKING THAT LOOKING AT THAT -- OPTION IS I THINK IMPORTANT AND SOMETHING THAT THAT WE WOULD ENCOURAGE -- AT THE PRESENCE IN DC IS IS JUST MY MY NUMBER -- ONE ASK REQUEST AND JUST A UNIFIED VOICE AND AGRICULTURE WE WORK TOWARDS THAT WITH THAT YOU SEE. ON DAVIS IN TERMS OF THE NUMBERS -- EDUCATED ECONOMIST YOU PUT THE TWO ECONOMISTS TOGETHER YOU CAN BE FARTHER APART. SO -- THAT'S ALWAYS HELPFUL TO HAVE THE INTERMEDIARIES AS TRANSLATORS -- COMING FROM THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY. I WOULD SAY I'M TRILINGUAL I SPEAK I GREW CULTURE ECONOMICS RATE AS AGREE OUR CHRISSY SPEAK SPANISH AND ENGLISH -- TO BUT ANYWAYS -- SO JUST WANNA AB PUT INTO THIS -- WERE WAITING AS EVERYONE ELSE'S STABILITY IS CRITICAL -- TO OUR BUYERS AND WE WANT TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION BUT ALSO WANT TO EXPRESS THE PAIN THAT HAS BECAUSE INDUSTRY BECAUSE IT SIGNIFICANT. AND THAT IS WHY WE HAVE BEEN VOCAL IN THE MEDICATION SO THANK YOU FOR THE TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH REALLY GRATEFUL THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO BE HERE ON BEHALF OF ALMOND GROWERS THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE TIME. WILL COME -- WITHOUT SEEN ANY OTHER PEOPLE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT -- YES MISTER BLOOM I JUST WANT TO THANK -- THE TWO OF YOU FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER IT'S BEEN EXTREMELY INFORMATIVE AND HELPFUL. THANK YOU AND AND THIS IS GOING TO BE AN ISSUE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO TRACK AS A AS WE LOOK AT THE IMPACTS OF DECISION MAKING ON CALIFORNIA -- FROM BEYOND OUR BORDERS THANK YOU THIS TURN IS ENDED. REPORTER SHE DOES NOT HAVE BEEN USING A LOT OF THE STUFF AND THEY HAVE. REMINDED. WHEN DIFFERENT KINDS YEAH? OF COURSE YOU GOT IT YEAH
