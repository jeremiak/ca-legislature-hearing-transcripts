PARKS AND WILDLIFE COMMITTEE. AND WE'RE GONNA GET STARTED WITH OUR INFORMATION HEARING ON SUBJECT BEING WHAT HAPPENS TO WATER SUPPLIES DURING POWER SHUT OFFS. LIKE TO CONVENE THIS INFORMATION HEARING ON THE IMPACT OF WATER SHUT OFFS ON WATER SUPPLIES THANK YOU TO THE OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND GUESTS FOR ATTENDING. THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WATCHING- THE LIVE STREAM AND TO EVERYONE IN THE ROOM AT TODAY. POWER OUTAGES HAVE MANY CONSEQUENCES WERE WONDERFUL POPULATIONS IN CALIFORNIA'S. AN AT LARGE AS MOST OF US KNOW CALIFORNIA POWER UTILITIES HAVE IMPLEMENTED PREVENTATIVE POWERSHOT IVES IN ORDER TO AVOID THE RISK OF THEIR EQUIPMENT STARTING DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRES IN ADDITION CALIFORNIA IS AT RISK FOR UNPLANNED POWER OUTAGES DUE TO STORMS EARTHQUAKES AND OTHER EVENTS TODAY WE ARE HERE TO LOOK AT POWER OUTAGES FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF WATER COMMUNITIES. HOW DO YOU WATER AGENCIES INSURE CONTINUED WATER DELIVERIES WHEN THE POWER IS OUT ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THESE AGENCIES ARE ENCOUNTERING AS A RESULT OF POWER OUTAGES TODAY WE WILL HEAR FROM THREE PANELS OF SPEAKERS I ASK THAT THE MEMBERS HERE THE PRESENTATIONS FROM ALL SPEAKERS ON THE PANEL BEFORE ASKING ANY QUESTIONS. THIS WILL HELP US STATE ON TIME. HELP OUR DISCUSSIONS TODAY ARE PRODUCTIVE AND RESULT IN A POSITIVE NEXT STEPS THE STATE AND ALL INTERESTED PARTIES CAN TAKE TO ENSURE OUR CONSTITUENTS. CONTINUE TO HAVE DRINKING WATER AND WASTEWATER SERVICES EVEN IF THE POWER IS OUT. AT WITH THAT DO ANY OTHER MEMBERS HAVE ANY OPENING COMMENTS WORK. DR ALRIGHT WE'LL START WITH OUR FIRST PANEL PLEASE REMEMBER TO STATE. STATE YOUR NAME AND THE ORGANIZATION AT THE END OF YOUR PRESENTATIONS PLEASE WELCOME. FORT AS A FIRST STEP ANALYSTS WILL BE ERIC THE MARU ACTING DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF RESPONSE OPERATIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA'S. GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AND THE OTHER IS THAT DON BOLAN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA TO THESE EMERGENCY ASSOCIATION WELCOME. AND YOU MAY BEGIN. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE TODAY AND THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION- TO SHARE WITH YOU- OUR ROLE AND THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO P. S. P. S. AND THAT IMPACTS- THAT WE HELP TO SUPPORT. WHY THE DECISION TO IMPLEMENT P. S. P. S. RESTS SOLELY WITH THE UTILITIES THAT DECISION ALONG WITH THE- RED FLAG FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS THAT EXISTED ACROSS CALIFORNIA LAST YEAR. RESULTED IN THE STATE HAVING TO MANAGE THE MANY CASCADING IN COMPLEX. COMPLEX CONSEQUENCES THAT ENSUED. WE LEVERAGE OUR WELL ESTABLISHED PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE SYSTEMS. OUR PRIMARY EFFORT WAS TO SUPPORT LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO PROTECT RESIDENTS AND MITIGATE THE IMPACTS LIFE PROPERTY IN THE ENVIRONMENT. THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES WITH THE OCTOBER PS PS OF ANTS PARTICULARLY IN THE CASES WERE OUTAGES OVERLAPPED AN EXTENDED FOR MULTIPLE DAYS. INCLUDED THE FREQUENCY SCOPE AND SCALE AND ALTERNATE CASCADING INTERDEPENDENT LIFELINE IMPACTS AREAS THE ENERGY. LEAVE SOBRE PS P. JEANNIE INITIATED THREE SMALL MORE DEFINED PS PS EVENTS IN SCOPE AND SCALE IN JUNE AND SEPTEMBER AND EARLY OCTOBER. THE LONGEST LASTED ROUGHLY TWO AND A HALF DAYS AND IMPACTED BETWEEN FIVE TO TWELVE COUNTIES RESTORATION FOLLOWING THOSE SMALLER EVENTS WAS DONE RELATIVELY QUICKLY. BETWEEN OCTOBER NINETEEN ELEVEN P. JEANNIE MADE THE DECISION TO DE ENERGIZED A MUCH BROADER AREA IMPACTING THIRTY EIGHT COUNTIES AND IT WE ESTIMATE A POPULATION OF ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE. IN LATE OCTOBER P. JEANNIE INITIATED THREE BACK TO BACK EVENTS. ON THE TWENTY THIRD TWENTY SIX AND TWENTY NINE PERSPECTIVE LEE. AND AGAIN THEY IMPACTED THIRTY EIGHT COUNTIES MANY OF WHICH HAD BEEN DE ENERGIZED SEVERAL TIMES. AT THIS POINT THE FREQUENCY OF THESE EVENTS WAS EVOLVING INTO REAL AND SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES. ON THE TWENTY THIRD OF OCTOBER P. JEANNIE DE ENERGIZED AN ESTIMATED FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE AND SEVENTEEN COUNTIES. LASTING OVER TWO DAYS THIS WAS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED ON OCTOBER TWENTY SIX WITH THE D. ENERGIES ATION OF THIRTY EIGHT COUNTIES WHICH LASTED OVER FIVE DAYS. AND WHILE P. JEANNIE WAS WORKING TO RESTORE POWER FROM THE TWENTY SIXTH OF AT. WHICH THEY WERE SUCCESSFUL IN SOME BUT NOT ALL AREAS ADDITIONAL PS PS WAS INITIATED ON THE TWENTY NINTH OF OCTOBER THAT OVERLAPPED MANY OF THE SAME COUNTIES THAT WERE ALREADY DE ENERGIZED. FROM THE TWENTY SIXTH OF THAT. THIS OUTAGE LASTED THROUGH NOVEMBER FIRST. THE OVERALL IMPACT WAS AN ESTIMATED POPULATION OF TWO POINT FOUR MILLION PEOPLE APPROXIMATELY SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE. WHO WERE DE ENERGIZE OCTOBER TWENTY SIXTH DID NOT SEE THEIR POWER RESTORED FOR MORE THAN SIX DAYS. AND WHAT'S IMPORTANT IN ALL OF THIS IS I'M HIGHLIGHTING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IMPACTED- OBVIOUSLY AS WE WORK WITH THE UTILITIES- THEY FOCUS ON THE CUSTOMER IMPACT THAT'S A SINGLE METER POINT. YOU KNOW BUT OUR ROLE AT THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES TO DEAL WITH THE CASCADE THE CASCADING CONSEQUENCES TO THE PEOPLE INVOLVED AND SO ALL OF OUR FIGURES A REFERENCE AN ESTIMATED POPULATION OF INDIVIDUALS IMPACTED BY THESE OUTAGES. AT THE SAME TIME P. JEANNIE WAS EXECUTING PS PS IN THE NORTH NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON IMPLEMENTED A SERIES OF EVENTS STARTING ON OCTOBER NINTH BAND THROUGH THE TWENTY SIXTH. AND IMPACTED SIX SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COMPANIES AN ESTIMATED POPULATION OF A HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE AND LASTED BETWEEN TWO TO EIGHT DAYS. IN THE FAR SOUTH SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC BETWEEN OCTOBER TENTH IN THE TWENTY FOURTH ALSO IMPLEMENTED THREE SEPARATE EVENTS IMPACTING AN ESTIMATED POPULATION OF FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE. EACH VARYING IN DURATION BETWEEN SEVERAL HOURS TO UP TO EIGHT DAYS. IN THE FRAME IN MID TO LATE OCTOBER ALL THREE UTILITIES. WERE SIMULTANEOUSLY IMPLEMENTING PS PS. BEYOND THE DIRECT IMPACT INDIVIDUALS PARTICULARLY AS THE OUTAGES EXTENDED INTO MULTIPLE DAYS IMPACTS THE HEALTH AND MEDICAL PROVIDERS SCHOOLS FUEL AND COMMODITY DISTRIBUTION CENTERS TELECOMMUNICATIONS TRANSPORTATION MANUFACTURING CRIMINAL JUSTICE WATER DELIVERY AND WASTE WATER MANAGEMENT EMERGED. THROUGHOUT ALL OF THE EVENTS WE COORDINATED. WITH UTILITIES TO ENSURE THE COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTERS THAT THEY STOOD UP. WERE SET UP WITH THE APPROPRIATE SCALE FOR THE POPULATION IMPACTED BY THE EVENT AND REMAINED OPEN AS LONG AS POSSIBLE EACH DAY WITH COMMODITY SUCH AS WATER ICE BLANKETS AS WELL AS INFORMATION AND POWER FOR INDIVIDUALS TO CHARGE DEVICES. HELLO YES FACILITATED ENGAGEMENT WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SECURITY AT THESE SITES. GIVEN THE SCOPE AND SCALE OF THESE EVENTS AND DRIVEN BY THE EXPECTED RED FLAG CONDITIONS AND MUCH OF THE STATE HELLO YES ACTIVATED THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER FOR OVER HALF OF THE MONTH OF OCTOBER TO ADDRESS THE CONSEQUENCES. WE MOBILIZED OVER TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY STAFF. CLOSE TO NINETY STATE AGENCIES TO SUPPORT THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER AND PROVIDE DIRECT SUPPORT. TO MANY OF THE COUNTY YEARS SEES THAT WERE ACTIVATED TO DEAL WITH THE CONDITIONS. CAL FIRE ENHANCE STAFFING STAFFING PATTERNS AND PRE POSITIONED ASSETS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. CALLAWAY YES STRATEGICALLY PRE POSITIONED MULTIPLE CALLOW YES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT STRIKE TEAMS AND TASK FORCES IN THE AREA. WHERE THERE'S A HIGH FIRE THREAT AS WELL AS PS PS CONDITIONS. WE DISPATCH LIAISON PERSONNEL FROM CALLAWAY US CAL FIRE THE PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION TO EACH OF THE UTILITIES EMERGENCY OPERATION CENTERS WE DEPLOYED STATE INCIDENT PLANNING SPECIALIST TO THE P. JEANNIE AOC. TO PROVIDE EXPERTISE ON USING ICS SYSTEM AS WELL AS TRIBAL AS WELL AS TRIBAL LIAISONS TO WORK WITH P. GENIES NEW TRIBAL LIAISON- REPRESENTATIVE. THIS COORDINATED EFFORT WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN MAXIMIZING THE PREPAREDNESS LEVELS RESPONDING QUICKLY TO EMERGING SITUATIONS AND ENSURING GOOD SITUATIONAL AWARENESS. WITH RAPID RESPONSE TO FIRES IN THE PROTECTION OF LIFE AND PROPERTY. IN PREPARATION FOR THESE EVENTS. WE HAVE BEEN MEETING JOINTLY WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL THE UTILITIES ALONG WITH THE UC AND CAL FIRE LEADERSHIP FOR THE BETTER PART OF A YEAR. DURING TWENTY NINETEEN OUR GOAL WAS AND ONTINUES TO BE TO ENSURE THE UTILITIES RECOGNIZE AND ADDRESS THE CONCERNS RAISED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS. AS WELL AS OUR OWN CONCERNS AND EXPECTATIONS AND PROVIDING STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT. PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICIALS WITH AMPLE NOTIFICATION OF PENDING PS PS EVENTS. FURTHER WE WANTED TO ENSURE THAT THE UTILITIES PROVIDE ACCURATE ONGOING CRITICAL INFORMATION AND DATA TO US AND TO THE PUBLIC. THROUGHOUT THESE MEETINGS WE WORK TO ENSURE THAT ALL THREE UTILITIES WERE DEVELOPING OPERATIONAL CONSTRUCTS. AND PUBLIC FACING MESSAGING THAT WOULD EXERCISE MORE CONSISTENT ENTRANCE ACROSS THE BOARD APPROACH WITH REGARD TO THEIR- PUBLIC EDUCATION. THEIR DECISION MAKING. THEIR NOTIFICATIONS TO STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THE ACTUAL EXECUTION OF THE EVENT ITSELF. IT'S STILL DURING THESE MULTI THAT THERE CONTINUE TO BE CHAO AN INK. WITH YOU. A ABILITY TO PROVIDE DETAILED AND TIMELY NOTIFICATIONS OF THEIR OUTAGES. REQUIRED DATA AND DETAILED MAPS OF ALGERIA'S DETAIL AND CRITICAL MALE MEDICAL BASELINE CUSTOMERS. SUPPORT TO CUSTOMERS IN AREAS IMPACTED BY THE OUTAGES AND INFORMATION AND TO SUPPORT. OTHER CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS. DURING THE EVENTS THE STATE CONTINUALLY MODEL THE POSTURE AND COMMUNICATION WE EXPECTED OF THE UTILITIES WE TEAMED UP WITH CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES IN LEAGUE OF CITIES. TECH HELP KEEP LOCAL STATE TRIBAL AND FEDERAL ELECTED OFFICIALS IN THE IMPACTED AREAS UPDATED. THROUGH THE CALLOW YES FACILITATED CALLS THOSE UTILITIES WERE THE PRIMARY PRESENTERS OF INFORMATION AND DURING THE NOVEMBER P. S. P. S. EVENTS UTILITIES TOOK OVER THE FACILITATION OF THOSE CALLS. ANOTHER WAY IN WHICH THE STATE STEPPED IN TO ENSURE THAT P. GENIES WEBSITES AND CULTURES WERE PREPARED TO SUPPORT CUSTOMERS IS INCLUDED THE DEPLOYMENT OF STATE PERSONNEL RESOURCES TO P. JEANNIE. TO STAND UP A NEW WEBSITE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO THEIR CUSTOMERS LASTLY TO ASSIST P. JEANNIE AND ACCELERATE THE TIME TO PROVIDE RESTORATION WE DEPLOYED PLANES AND HELICOPTERS WITH SPECIALIZED. FLEER TECHNOLOGY FROM THE C. H. P. AND THE NATIONAL GUARD TO HELP P. JEANNIE INCREASE THE SPEED OF INSPECTING THEIR LINES FOLLOWING THE EVENTS. PARTICULARLY AND I KNOW THE INTEREST OF THIS COMMITTEE. IS THE IMPACT WATER SYSTEMS WHICH WAS CERTAINLY SIGNIFICANT. THE AMP FOR WATER SYSTEMS THIS MEANT THE CALORIE S. COORDINATED WITH THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD DIVISION OF DRINKING WATER TO IDENTIFY AND REACH OUT TO DRINKING WATER AND WASTEWATER FACILITIES AHEAD OF THE P. S. P. AS EVENTS. TO IDENTIFY- WHAT IMPACTS WERE LIKELY TO BE EXPECTED. THIS CAUSED SOME HEARTBURN IN SOME AREAS NO ELECTRICITY- BY THE FOR THE PS PS EVENTS MEANS WATER STOPS MOVING STOPS BEING CLEANED AND DURING THE P. S. P. S. EVENTS P. JEANNIE REPORTED THAT ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SIXTEEN WATER AGENCIES WERE AFFECTED ESTY JEANNIE REPORTED FIFTY FOUR. IN PARTICULAR IN THE CITY OF BENICIA THEY WERE RUNNING WELL RUNNING ON BACKUP WATER THE CITY LOST POWER THAT HAVE NO WATER IN FAIRFIELD ONE WATER TREATMENT FACILITY WAS OFF LINE A SECOND FACILITY WAS FUNCTIONING AND ABLE TO HANDLE THE CAPACITY. IN GLEN THEIR NATURAL GAS WATER PUMP STOPPED WORKING IN ASSISTANCE WAS DEPLOED TO FIX IT IN TAMING COUNTY THE CITY OF RED BLUFF HAD AN ISSUE WITH THE WATER SUPPLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF PUMPS WERE ON GENERATOR POWER THIS WAS A CONCERN REGARDING WATER TO A COUNTY JAIL FACILITY. TO COMMUNITIES IN TRINITY COUNTY STAGE WATER TRUCKS SO RESIDENTS COULD FILL UP BUCKETS TO USE FOR FLASHING THEIR TOILETS AS A THIRD OF WELLS. WE'RE IN A- DUE TO LOSS OF POWER. COMMUNITIES OF COMPLY. AND IN PARTICULAR IN THE TOWN OF LAKE PORT- WE WORK WITH PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC AS WELL AS OUR PARTNERS AT FEMA TO GET BACK UP GENERATION TO SUPPORT BOTH THEIR WATER FACILITY AND THE WASTE WATER TREATMENT FACILITY. WE ALSO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE THE STATE WATER PROJECT WAS OPERABLE THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM. ALL CRITICAL LOCATIONS HAD EMERGENCY BACKUP GENERATORS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF PUMPS AT THE CORDELIA PUMPING PLANT. THIS PLANT FEATS NAPA BENICIA AND VALLEJO AND LARGE GENERATORS EVENTUALLY ARRIVED IN WERE HOOKED UP TO SUPPORT THAT FACILITY. WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT THE PS PS EVENTS LAST OCTOBER PRESENTED US WITH A SERIES OF COMPLEX CHALLENGES THEY WERE SOMEWHAT MITIGATED TO CALIFORNIA'S EXTENSIVE CAPABILITIES AND EXPERIENCE WITH MANAGING MAJOR EMERGENCIES. AND DISASTERS INCLUDING THE CAPABILITIES OF OUR EXTENSIVE MUTUAL AID SYSTEMS. HOWEVER HOWEVER AS YOU'LL HEAR TODAY ABOUT THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES FACED BY WATER SYSTEMS THIS INFORMATION CHAIR TODAY IN THREE PREVIOUS REPORTS WILL HELP INFORM PREPARATIONS FOR THE NEXT ROUND. YES EVENTS. THANK YOU CHAIRED MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU ONCE GOT THERE WE GO JUMP RIGHT INTO THE NEXT PRESENTER AND THEN WE'LL OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU CARE GOOD MORNING I AM ON POLAND. DIRECTOR LIAM MISSY ASSOCIATION WE ARE THE M. ALL WITH YOU PARTNER WITH OLD P. S. WILL RESIDE IN THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER. WE WERE FORMED IN NINETEEN FIFTY TWO AT THE DIRECTION THE GOVERNOR EARL WARREN. OUR ENTIRE FOCUS IN THIS OP TIONS. PROVIDE MUTUAL ASSISTANCE ALL HANFORD PLANNING COORDINATION COMMUNICATIONS. PLAN FOR ALL THREE AND POST ANSWERS ENERGY EVEN INTEGRATED PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN ALL OUR YOU BILL AT LEAST. HE REPRESENTS FORTY TWO POWER BENEATH POLLUTING THE- PROGRESS TODAY. HE REPRESENTS. REALLY WILL IMPACT THE NEXT UTILITY. IN DOING SO WE ASSEMBLED THE UTILITY OPERATIONS CENTER IN SUPPORT OF THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER IN THEIR CENTER HAS ROUGHLY FOUR LEGS LIKE YOUR DINING ROOM TABLE WE HAVE GAS AND PIPELINE WE HAVE POWER TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND WATER WASTEWATER THE ADVANTAGE OF HAVING THIS TOTALLY IN BETTER IN- E. S. IS THE FACT THAT THE P. S. P. S. PROVIDER. WHETHER THAT BE LADWP SP G. ANY S. C. E. OR P. JEANNIE WHICH IS THE LARGEST CONTIGUOUS POWER COMPANY IN UNITED STATES ACTUALLY HANDS THERE IN THE BILL AND THEY ARE AT A BASE IN YEARS THE OTHER TO TELL THESE BEING IMPACTED CAN EXCHANGE REAL TIME INFORMATION AS TO WHAT IS IMPACTED IN THE GRID WHEN IT WAS IMPACTED IN THE GRID. AND WHAT THE ANTICIPATED EXPECTATION FOR THEIR IMPACT IS UNDERSTANDING IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN WE HAD MAJOR AND SOME WHICH WE ARE ACTIVATED TO SUPPORT DATA SINCE. IN A- FORTY EIGHT DAYS COVER PS PS YOUR IN THE RICH EARTHQUAKE IN TWO AND EIGHTEEN WE HAD SEVEN EVENTS WHICH RAN FOR NINETY FOUR CALENDAR DAYS FOR PS PS SPIDERS IN STORMS UNDERSTANDING THAT WATER IS ONE OF THE UTILITIES THAT CANNOT BE PHYSICALLY PICKED UP AND MOVED LIKE WE CAN GENERATION OR WE CAN MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS IT'S IN BED IT. AND AS SUCH WE HAVE TO ADDRESS IT WHERE IT'S AT WATER IN AND OF ITSELF CAN LAST ROUGHLY THREE DAYS YOU CAN LIVE WITHOUT THE INCONVENIENCE OF A CELL PHONE FOR A WEEK IF YOU HAD TO AND YOU PROBABLY LIVE WITHOUT POWER IS INCONVENIENTLY AS YOU CANNOT WITHOUT WATER NOR CAL FIRE NOR CAL WE ASPIRE NOR CAN THEY MEET SYMBOL. USED WHO ARE CHARGED THE SUPPRESSION IN THE EVENT OF A FIRE SO NOT ALL THE WE HAVE TO IT UP THE ONLY WE WOULD DONT FOR ST YOU WANT ANY FOR YOUR SUPPORT CAPE SO THAT WE CAN PER THE HOME EIGHT THE UNITY. AND SAW THERE COMMUNICATION WORKS ALSO WILL HAVE A BETTER TO A CRITICAL COMPONENT IN THE U. OP CENTER SUPPORT THE STATE APPARATUS CONSENT. THROUGH WORK ACTIVATED IT HE RUBS THE SPOT OPERATIONS IN REPORTS OF TO WHAT WE CALL THE UC THE YOU CA GROUP WHICH IS AGE CAL NATIONAL IN RDER TO GET SITUATIONAL AWARENESS WE IN BED THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION IN THE YOU WILL SEE BECAUSE FUEL BECOMES A CRITICAL LIFELINE FACTOR TO KEEP THE GENERATORS AND OR OTHER TYPE PUMPS RUNNING WHEN WE DO NOT HAVE POWER CAPABILITIES WE ALSO IN BIT. ISEL CAL LYSOL OVERS IT'S THE DISTRIBUTION OF PROCUREMENT OF POWER FOR THE ENTIRE GRID IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH POWER ALLOCATED TO AREAS THAT IT ENDED UP RE ROUTED STAND BY OUR AVAILABLE FOR THOSE THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THE P. S. P. S. OPERATIONS WE ALSO HANDLE THE MUTUAL WE BROUGHT IN OVER EIGHT HUNDRED GROUPS FROM OUR- REGION AND OUT OF THE STATE TO SUPPORT. IN A- SET. THERE ARE LINES TO ONE TO THE PSP A DOCTOR BY THIS. ALL LIE MUST BE PHYSICALLY IN. IN ORDER TO EXPEDITE THOSE INSPECTIONS TO ALLOW THEM TO TURN THE GRID BACK ON WE HAVE BROUGHT IN MUTUALLY. AS IT COMES TO WATER- WE HAD THE RIDGE CREST EARTHQUAKE THAT CAME UP ON. SEVEN FOUR EIGHT SIX FOUR AND THEN AGAIN ON SEVEN FIVE IT IS SEVEN ONE. WE PROVIDED MULTIPLE MUTUAL ASSISTANCE COMPANIES ON THE AFTERNOON OF SEVEN FOUR FROM CAL WATER LED TO BE P. M. D. W. D. W. R. TO SEAR WAS VALLEY WATER COMPANY- WE WORKED THROUGH CAL EPA CD PH IN THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER. MALL HOBBY WATER DEPLOYED ALL OF THEIR CREWS IN MUTUAL AID WE HAD REST EIGHTEEN HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS IN THEIR TOWN. ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES IN THEIR OWN IS THEY DO NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT AIR CONDITIONING. MOST OF THE HOMES USED WHAT ARE CALLED SWAMP COOLERS WHICH ONE ALL THIS. WATER SYSTEM FOR THERE EIGHT HUNDRED A MONTH BACK AND SO HUNDRED NINE SIX CONNECTIONS OUT FIFTY TWO OR COMMERCIAL EIGHT FOR INDUSTRIAL AND WE HAD KNOCKED OUT CHINA LAKE NAVAL AIR STATION ALL RESTORED WITHIN FOUR AND A HALF DAYS. BY MULTIPLE OUTSIDE CREWS COMING TO THE AID OF CERIALIS SO IN ESSENCE WE IN FACT ARE THE CORE COMPETENCY PARTNER OF OLD P. S. FOR. I USE LIKE P. JEANNIE MUNICIPALS LIKE LED B. P. AND M. D. W. SEVEN TEEN CABLE AND POWER. COMMUNICATION COMPANIES FROM EIGHTEEN ANTI VERIZON SPRINT T. MOBILE- WE HAVE **** CABLE THE REST SO FROM THAT STANDPOINT WE ARE A SUPPORT PASSAGE THAT COVERS ALL OF THE UTILITY BASES. REACHES OUT TO HOME IN REAL TIME CAN LOOK AT THE DATA IN REAL TIME THANK ASSESSMENT TO. THE STATUS TO THE STATE THAT NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU TO BOTH OF YOU OPEN IT UP TO QUESTIONS ABOUT QUIRK. SO SEWERS CHOOSE ME. SANITARY DISTRICTS- WHETHER TREATMENT. OF FOR AFFLUENT ARM HOW MANY OF THOSE WERE NOT ABLE TO FUNCTION IN WHAT WAS THE ENVIRONMENTAL AFFECT A WHICHEVER ONE OF YOU CAN ANSWER. I WOULD HAVE TO TAKE THAT AS A GO BACK FOR YOU SIR- AND REACH BACK TO THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD- WHAT WE WERE LOOKING AT WAS IMMEDIATE IMPACTS- SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THOSE THAT WERE RAISED TO THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER THAT WE ADDRESSED. BUT OVERALL IMPACTS NUMBER OF FACILITIES THAT HAD TO TURN TO A BACKUP GENERATOR OR HAD ISSUES WITH THE BACKUP GENERATOR THAT WASN'T SOMETHING THAT WAS NECESSARILY BEING REPORTED UP TO US BUT WE CAN PROBABLY WORK THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD CAN ACCOUNT OF THAT. ALL RIGHT AND YOU MENTIONED IN TRINITY COUNTY THEY WERE TRACKING WIDER READING AND- HOW MANY- PEOPLE- DID NOT HAVE WATER FOR SOME PERIOD- DURING THE SHUT OFF. POWER I THINK THAT'S GONNA BE AN AREA THAT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH TO QUANTIFY- BECAUSE THERE'S A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO. WHO'S WELLS DID NOT WORK BECAUSE OF THAT AND THAT. THROUGH THEIR OWN MEANS I WORK TO RESOLVE THAT PROBLEM AND IT NEVER GOT ESCALATED AT THE GOVERNMENT AS AN EMERGENCY RESPONSE- BUT I WOULD IMAGINE ACROSS THE SPECIALLY THE- THIRTY EIGHT COUNTIES P. JEANNIE IMPACTED MANY OF WHICH ARE RURAL COMMUNITIES ARE A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS- STRUGGLING WITH THEIR- WELL SYSTEMS AND- AND OKAY BESIDES WELLS. HOW HOW MANY. YOU MENTIONED AGAIN TRINITY COUNTY IS ONE PLACE WHERE THEY HAD TO GIVE OUT WATER- WHETHER OTHER PLACES WHERE THEY HAD TO TRUCK IN WATER. I WOULD SUSPECT THERE THERE ARE- BUT THOSE DIDN'T NECESSARILY REYES STAR LEVEL AT THE STATE IF THEY WERE BEING HANDLED LOCALLY BUT I SUSPECT THAT THERE WAS OKAY. WELL PERHAPS ONE OF THE OTHER- PANELS CAN GIVE US MORE QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION- BUT IT'S VERY HARD TO KNOW- I JUST HAVE SERIOUS THE PROBLEM WAS IF WE DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION AND THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK WE REALLY NEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. COMIDAS THE ROLE OF THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES AS IT RELATES TO- THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER FOR EXAMPLE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES IN THE C. U. P. HOW ENGAGED ARE THEY- MAYBE YOU CAN KIND OF GIVE US A BIT OF AN INSIGHT ON THE LEVEL OF COMMUNICATION AN INTERAGENCY COLLABORATION- SO WHEN WE ACTIVATED THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER FOR THE PSP AS EVENTS IN ADDITION TO WHAT- MR BOLAND ARTICULATED THE AGENCIES WE BROUGHT TOGETHER- TO FOCUS STRICTLY ON IMPACTS UTILITIES WE HAD CAL EPA AND REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES IN THE ROOM WITH US. SO THAT THEY HAD DIRECT CONTACT WITH THEIR CONSTITUENCIES- SO THAT WE COULD UNDERSTAND WHAT THE IMPACTS WERE SO THERE IS A DIRECT DALY ENGAGEMENT- WITH THAT STAFF TO HELP COORDINATE AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT THE STAFF FROM CALLIE PA WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN GETTING US VISIBILITY INTO WHAT SOME OF THE IMPACTS WERE TO LARGER- A MUNICIPAL WATER SYSTEMS AND WASTEWATER SYSTEMS. AND SO THAT WE COULD BEGIN THE PRE PLANNING TO UNDERSTAND WHERE WE MIGHT NEED TO DEPLOY GENERATION CAPABILITIES SO REALLY WAS INSTRUMENTAL THERE'S A- YES THE WORK WITH THE- THE WATER AGENCIES TO DEVELOP- EMERGENCY SHUT OFF PLANTS IN THIS CASE. SO YES DOES NOT. THE WATER AGENCIES- THROUGH- THAT SUPPORT OF THEIR COUNTY EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT OFFICES WORK INDEPENDENTLY TO BUILD THEIR EMERGENCY RESPOSE PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE PLANS- WE CERTAINLY PROVIDE EXPERTISE- WHEN REQUESTED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THOSE PLANS BRINGING AND- BEST PRACTICES FROM OTHER JURISDICTIONS. WE ALSO WORK- BEGINNING TO WORK DIRECTLY WITH THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE MORE EDUCATION AND OUTREACH TO A LOT OF THOSE. A UTILITIES THAT FALL WITHIN THAT THAT AREA SO BETWEEN BOTH OUR ENGAGEMENT WITH COUNTY- YES OFFICES THAT REACH DOWN- TO THE PUBLIC AGENCIES WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTION AS WELL AS- OTHER OPPORTUNITIES WERE TRYING TO EXPAND- OUR SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE AND TRAINING TO ORGANIZATIONS. WHAT THE DIRECTIVE FOR- THE SHUT OFF TO OCCUR. THE WATER AGENCIES RECEIVED THAT IMMEDIATE INFORMATION FROM- YES OR IS IT DIRECTLY FROM THE TO LADY WHAT IS THAT REPORTER CALL LOOK LIKE SO THE UTILITIES PROVIDE A SEVENTY TWO HOUR NOTIFICATION AND THEN A FORTY EIGHT HOUR NOTIFICATION WHEN THEY ARE LOOKING AT DOING A PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF THAT COMMUNICATION FIRST GOES TO CUSTOMERS SO IF THAT THE- UTILITY AS A CUSTOMER OF THE I. O. U. THEY'RE GETTING A DIRECT NOTIFICATION FROM THE I OWE YOU. A MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE ALSO DOING ADDITIONAL NOTIFICATIONS OUT TO THEIR- COMMUNITY- NGUYEN P. S. P. S. EVENTS ARE PLANNED AND THEN AT THE STATE LEVEL WE'RE SORT OF THE THIRD LINE OF REDUNDANT IF YOU WILL IN TERMS OF GETTING NOTIFICATIONS OUT A TWO. ME GINSENG. OFFICES TO ENSURE THAT THEIR TRACKING THE EVENT. HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION AND PLANNING INTELLIGENCE THAT THEY NEED. ALL RIGHT THE CLOSER. SO DID YOU DID YOU ARE SUPPLY BACKUP POWER TO EITHER SEWER OR WATER AGENCIES. WE DID I'M AWARE OF AT LEAST TWO SITUATIONS AND LAKE PORT WHERE WE PROVIDED GENERATION FOR THEIR WATER AND WASTEWATER I BELIEVE- CINNAMON QUIRK THERE WAS ADDITIONAL- ADDITIONAL CAPABILITIES REPORT WE PROVIDED APPROXIMATELY FIFTY GENERATORS ACROSS THE STATE WHEN I SAY PROVIDED WE COORDINATED EITHER TO THE DEPLOYMENT OF GENERATORS WE HAD FROM FEMA WERE WE WORK DIRECTLY WITH THE I OWE YOU- TO REQUIRE THEM TO DEPLOY GENERATION TO KEEP FACILITIES SO- I'M AWARE OF AT LEAST TWO SITUATIONS WHERE WE PROVIDE. BACKUP GENERATION TO WATER AND WASTEWATER FACILITIES AND BELIEVE THERE MAY HAVE BEEN MORE AS WELL OKAY THANK YOU. OKAY ANY PUSH. YES. IF BONTA AND WHEN AND NOT THE POWER WAS SHUT OFF OF A LOT OF A- OUR FOCUS RUBIO PS PS IS ACTIVATED TO. YOU FORTY S. YOU OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES THE WHOLE. WOULD YOU. DO IT DIFFERENTLY THAN LAST YEAR IN THE WEST WHAT LESSONS HAVE YOU LEARNED FROM IT. I THINK WHAT AREAS WERE pSEVERAL MONTHS A IS UNDERSTANDING. BETTER WHAT THE CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES ARE AT A LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL- SO THAT WE CAN PRI PLAN WHERE ASSETS FROM THE STATE MAY BE REQUIRED OR ASSETS FROM THE OHIO USE MAY BE REQUIRED TO SUPPORT. A LOCAL CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING WATER AND WASTEWATER FACILITIES SO WE'RE GONNA BE WORKING WITH THE COUNTIES. DEVELOP A PROCESS. YOU COLLECTED UNDERSTAND CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE WHAT BACK UP CAPABILITIES EXIST AT KEY FACILITIES SO WE'VE GOT A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE THE WHERE THE GAPS MAY BE AS WE GO INTO AN EVENT TO HELP US BE MORE PREPARED TO RESPOND IF YOU HAVE- DIFFICULTIES- COORDINATING. WITH A LOCAL LAN JURISDICTIONS LAST YEAR AND THE- WE ARE WORKING ON TO IMPROVE IT I THINK AS WE REACHED OUT THROUGH THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD- WE DID NOT RECEIVE A FEEDBACK WE WERE HOPING FROM THE UTILITIES- ESPECIALLY WELL WATER WASTEWATER FACILITIES TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE VULNERABILITIES MAYBE- IN IN SOME KEY. AND THIS WAS NOT NECESSARILY WIDESPREAD THERE WAS THINK THERE WAS A CONFIDENT. ONE EXPERIENCE THAT THEY COULD MAINTAIN OPERATIONS BUT CERTAINLY WHAT WE EXPERIENCED IN THE LATE OCTOBER THAT'S WAS ON THE SCOPE AND SCALE THAT WAS MUCH GREATER THAN- MANY OF THOSE INSTITUTIONS THAT DEALT WITH PREVIOUSLY AND SO WE WANT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT THE VULNERABILITIES ARE- SO THAT WE CAN. UNDERSTAND WHERE PRIORITIZE OUR RESOURCES AT THE GREATEST EFFECT. THE THAN THE COORDINATING. IS THE A LAST CHANCE NOW THIS YEAR THAT THE EMERGENCY SHUT OFF FOR WILL TAKE PLACE. AND THE- IF FOR A- THAT IS SO UNFORTUNATE SITUATION TO A- HAVE A ANNA THOUGH I SHUT OFF- ACTIVATED THEN. HI THIS SERVICE IN THE VICTIMS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. IS THERE ANY OTHER THE IMPROVEMENTS SAID THAT YOU'D BE MAKING. SO OUR JOB IS TO DEAL WITH THE CONSEQUENCE MANAGEMENT WHEN THE UTILITIES MAKE THE DISK INTO AN ISSUE A P. I. S. THE UTILITIES ARE ARE INDICATED TO US THAT THE STATE THAT THEY ARE HOPING TO DRAW DOWN THE SCOPE AND SCALE OF THESE EVENTS THIS YEAR- WE ARE CONTINUING TO PUSH THEM ON THAT FRONT- WHAT WE ARE FOCUSED ON RIGHT NOW IS A BETTER UNDERSTANDING WITH THE GREATEST VULNERABILITY. THESE ARE OUR THROUGHOUT THE BE DINNER. AND THEN CONTINUING AND OUR SYSTEMS THAT WE CAN BE. FAST TO NEED AS THESE EVENTS DEVELOP SO WE'RE NOT IN A POSITION TO STOP THESE P. S. P. S. EVENTS FROM OCCURRING- BUT WE ARE IN A POSITION TO WORK WITH THE UTILITIES. TO GET THEM TO FOCUS ON REDUCING THE SCOPE AND SCALE OF THESE EVENTS OF THAT. CAN MITIGATE THE IMPACT TO THE POPULATION TO THE BEST WE CAN. THANK HERE QUESTIONS OAK RIGHT WELL THANK YOU FOR. IS ANY THIS MORNING WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE WHEN ASKED AT THE OTHER TWO HAVE PRESENTERS PLEASE COME FORWARD. AT THIS TIME- JOE MCDERMOTT DIRECTOR OF ENGINEERING EXTERNAL AFFAIRS. AS WE CAN IS MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT. AT CLIFFORD CHEN DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE EAST BAY MUNICIPAL. WATER DISTRICT WHAT. WE'VE GOT A THIRD DISTRICT AND MICHAEL A MENTOR NAM JR MANAGER OF CALAVERAS COUNTY WATER DISTRICT. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU CHAIRMAN GARCIA COMMITTEE. COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TO TODAY. MY NAME'S JOHN MCDERMOTT. ON A DIRECT ON THE DIRECTOR OFENGINEERING AND EXTERNAL AFFAIRS FOR LOTS VIRGINIS MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT. WE'RE A RETAIL WATER AND WASTEWATER AGENCIES SERVING APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY THOUSAND RESIDENTS IN THE WESTERNMOST PORTION OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY. MY AGENCY WAS SEVERELY IMPACTED BY THE DEVASTATING WAS A FIRE IN LATE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THAT SCORCHED TWO THIRDS OF OUR ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SQUARE MILE SERVICE AREA AND RESULTED IN SEVERAL MILLION DOLLARS IN DAMAGES TO OUR FACILITIES. NOT TO MENTION THE HUNDREDS OF CUSTOM TO FOSTER HOMES. THE WILL BE FAR PROVIDED US WITH AN IMPORTANT REMINDER OF THE NEED TO INVEST AND RESILIENCY. FOR DISASTERS WILDFIRES AND EVEN PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF PS PS EVENTS. WITHOUT ELECTRICITY WATER UTILITIES CANNOT PUMP AND TREAT WATER THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO CUSTOMERS FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY PURPOSES INCLUDING COOKING CLEANING BATHING AND SANITATION. THE GOAL OF WATER AGENCIES IS TO MAINTAIN CONTINUOUS SERVICE TO THE CUSTOMERS AT ALL TIMES EVEN DURING PS PS AMOUNTS. ELECTRIC SERVICE FOR LVM W. D. IS PROVIDED BY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON. IN THE LAST YEAR LVM WD HAS RECEIVED APPROXIMATELY SIXTY SIX P. S. P. S. EVENT NOTIFICATIONS WITH TEN EVENTS THAT ACTUALLY RESULTED IN POWER LOSS. IN THESE POWER LOSSES WERE NOT NECESSARILY TO THE ENTIRE SERVICER BUT AT LEAST PORTIONS OF OUR SERVICE AREA. OUR EXPERIENCE ESSENCE NOTIFICATIONS ARE BOTH TIMELY AND ACCURATE. HOWEVER WATER AGENCIES FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERNS WITH THE AMOUNT OF ADVANCE NOTICE PROVIDED FOR PS PS EVENTS THE ACCURACY AND GRANULARITY OF THE DATA PROVIDED AND THE NEED FOR BETTER NOTIFICATION ON SERVICE RESTORATION. THIS FEEDBACK IN THE CASE THAT THERE IS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT. PS PS EVENTS PRESENT A VARIETY OF OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES FOR WATER AGENCIES UPON NOTIFICATION OF AN OF AN EVENT WATER SYSTEM OPERATORS TYPICALLY SWITCH THE PUMPS TO MANUAL OPERATION MODE IN ORDER TO TOP OFF THE WATER STORAGE TANKS. THE HOLES IN THE TANKS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO TREAT THE NORMAL RANGE AND KEPT TO REMAIN FULL OR NEAR FULL. TO BE SURE THAT ADEQUATE WATERS OF IT SHOULD A POWER SHUT OFF ACTUALLY OCCUR. THIS PROCESS CAN RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COSTS FOR PUMPING DURING PEAK PERIODS THAT ARE NORMALLY AVOIDED AND FOR OVERTIME WIN STAFFER CALLED OUT DURING NON WORKING HOURS. WHEN ELECTRICITY IS CUT OFF TO WATER SYSTEM OPERATORS MUST ACTIVATE BACKUP POWER. SOURCES INCLUDING OVERSEE BACKUP GENERATORS. RELIEF REFILLING OF GENERATORS AS NECESSARY AND REQUIRES DALY SHUTTLING A FUEL SUPPLIES. MECHANICS AND ELECTRICIANS ALSO NEED TO BE AVAILABLE ON STAND BY TO ADDRESS FAILURES OR OTHER PROBLEMS THAT CAN ARISE. FOR IS PS FOUR IS PS PS OF ANTS LVM W. D. WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN CONTINUOUS SERVICE TO ITS CUSTOMERS WITH THE USE OF EMERGENCY BACKUP GENERATORS HOWEVER DURING THE WILL BE FAR EL THE NWT EXPERIENCED A GENERATOR FAILURE THAT TEMPORARILY INTERRUPTED. PUMPING OR PORTION OF A SERVICE AREA CAUSING LOW WATER PRESSURE. AND THE NEED TO ISSUE A OF BOIL WATER NOTICE. TO MAINTAIN CONTINUOUS SERVICE DURING EMERGENCIES ANTI S. P. S. EVENTS OF THE NWT AND WATER AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. NEED TO INCREASE THEIR FOCUS. ON RIGOROUS MAINTENANCE AND TESTING OF A MERCY BACKUP GENERATORS TO ENSURE THE RELIABILITY. THE EQUIPMENT USED TO BE EXERCISED. AND LOW TESTED REGULARLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR IN ACCORDANCE WITH MANUFACTURE RECOMMENDATIONS AND STANDARDS ISSUED BY THE NATIONAL FIRE PROTECTION AGENCY. HOWEVER STRICT RUN TIME LIMITS PRESCRIBED BY STATE AND LOCAL AIR QUALITY REGULATIONS ARE A BARRIER. FOR WATER UTILITIES TO PREPARE AN OPERATOR GENERATORS FOR POWER SHUT OFFS. ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY IS NEEDED TO MAINTAIN TESTING OPERATE EMERGENCY BACKUP GENERATORS. THIS IS WHY LV NWT IS CO SPONSORING THE LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL WITH THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITY USE ASSOCIATION THIS YEAR TO RELAX SOME OF THE TESTING AND RUNTIME RESTRICTIONS THAT CURRENTLY SAYS SO THAT AGENCIES SUCH AS OURS CAN AVOID COSTLY FARMS AND FOR THE NEED TO REPLACE OLDER GENERATORS WITH NEW GENERATORS. AND UNNECESSARY AND COSTLY ENDEAVOR. WATER AGENCIES ALSO FACE FINANCIAL CHALLENGES TO AFFECTING EFFECTIVELY PREPARE FOR AND RESPOND TO PS PS EVENTS. AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED AGENCIES EXPERIENCED. INCREASED OPERATING COSTS ASSOCIATE WITH ADDITIONAL LABOR AND OVER TIME EXPENDITURES EQUIPMENT RENTALS PEAK PERIOD PUMPING FUEL PURCHASES. E. S. P. S. OF ANSWER KERN CONTRIBUTING TO THE NEED FOR SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL INVESTMENTS TO IMPROVE RESILIENCY OF WATER SYSTEMS DURING POWER OUTAGES. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE NOT ONLY INCLUDE THE PURCHASE OF NEW PORTABLE EMERGENCY GENERATORS WHICH ARE IN SHORT SUPPLY. BUT ALSO UPGRADE OF FACILITIES TO INCLUDE STATIONERY GENERATORS AND OUT ANOTHER LOGICAL UPGRADES. THE INVESTMENT REQUIRED FOR OUR AGENCY ALONE IS IN THE SEVERAL MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. BY EXTRAPOLATING THIS YOUR STATEWIDE THIS INVESTMENT. NEED COULD POTENTIALLY EXCEEDS SEVERAL HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THIS YEAR'S PROPOSED BUDGET INCLUDES FIFTY NINE AND ONE TIME FUNDS TO SUPPORT ADDITIONAL PREPAREDNESS SPECIAL DISTRICTS SUCH AS OURS THE PROVIDE CRITICAL CERTAIN SERVICES. WERE INADVERTENTLY LEFT OUT OF THIS YEAR'S CURRENT BUDGET FOR FUNDING. IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT IT'S NOT JUST AGENCIES COUNTY CITIES THAT PROVIDE CRITICAL SERVICES SPECIAL DISTRICTS ALSO PROVIDE MUCH OF THE STATE'S CRITICAL SERVICES OF ALL. IT'S A POSITIVE STEP THAT WE ARE INCLUDED IN THIS GO AROUND. SO IN CONCLUSION ELECTRICAL SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE IMPORTANT UTILITY PARTNERS FOR WATER AGENCIES. AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORK WITH OUR HEWLETT UTILITY COUNTERPARTS TO IMPLEMENT PS PS EVENTS AFFECTED EARLY. WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT HE S. P. S. EVENTS ARE KEY INTERIM MEASURE TO REDUCE THE POTENTIAL FOR WILDFIRES. THAT CAN BE CAUSED BY A DOWNED POWER LINES HOWEVER PS PS ADVANCE SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS A LONG TERM SOLUTION. TO REDUCE THE THREAT OF WHILE FAR UTILITIES ACROSS THE STATE NEED TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS TO IMPROVE THE RESILIENCY. ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FROM THE STATE IS NEEDED TO ADDRESS P. S. P. S. RESILIENCY FOR HER AND WASTE WATER AGENCIES. MANY OF WHICH ARE SPECIAL DISTRICT. THAT CONCLUDES MY TESTIMONY WILL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE A FEW WILL THANK YOU PROCEED WITH THE NEXT PRESENTER AND THEN SOME QUESTIONS THE- AFTER THE THIRD TO. THE DAY THANK YOU. A GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS I'M CLIFFORD JAN THE DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE FOR THE EAST BAY MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT. OR EAST BAY MUCH. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD TODAY TO SHARE OUR EXPERIENCES WITH THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF LAST FALL. BEFORE I GET INTO THE DETAILS LET ME START BY SAYING THAT EAST BAY MIGHT HAD NO SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS TO OUR WATER AND WAY FOR CUSTOMERS. DURING LAST YEAR'S PS PS ONCE. OUR SUCCESSFUL RESPONSE WITH THE RESULT OF SIGNIFICANT ADVANCE PREPARATION. EXTENSIVE COMMUNICATION WITH OUR CUSTOMERS PROACTIVE COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE I. O. U. AND COORDINATION EFFORTS WITH ARMORED SEES RESPONSE PARTNERS. ALL OF WHICH RESULTED IN CONSIDERABLE COST IT BAY MUD AND ITS RATEPAYERS I THINK ALL OF YOU HAVE THEY HAD ALL IN FRONT OF YOU LOOK AT THE FIRST PAGE A HAND OUT I LIKE TO START TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT EAST BAY MUD. WHERE THE SECOND LARGEST WATER RETAILER IN CALIFORNIA AND THE TWELFTH LARGEST IN THE NATION. REVIVED WATER PURPOSE TO OVER ONE FOUR BILLION REPRESENTS. OUR SERVICE AREA ENCOMPASSES THREE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO SQUARE MILES AND INCLUDES TWENTY CITIES AND FIFTY ON IN CORPORATE IS IN ALAMEDA AND CONTRA COSTA COUNTIES. OR WORSE I FACILITIES EXTEND FAR PRIMARY BARS I RESERVOIR NINETY EAST. IN THE FOOTHILL. YES THEY MIGHT ALSO PER. WORKFORCE TOOK. SO HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND RESIDENTS IT AND EIGHTY EIGHT SQUARE MILE SERVICE AREA. MOVING TO THE SECOND PAGE OF YOUR HAND OUT. ON EAST BAY MUCH MORE SYSTEM IS COMPLEX DUE TO ITS SIZE AND TOPOGRAPHY. WE HAVE OVER FOUR HUNDRED WATER FACILITIES ALL OF WHICH CAN BE AFFECTED BY A PS PS ABOUT. OUR SERVICE AREA EXTENDS FROM SEA LEVEL TO ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE IN ELEVATION AND IS DIVIDED INTO PRESSURES OWNS. WATER ME PUMPED TO MANY OF OUR CUSTOMERS. IF THEY MIGHT HAVE A HUNDRED TWENTY TO ASSURE THAT. THE THIS IN PERSPECTIVE SANFORD HAS TEN. SO WHY ARE YES THE VENT A CONCERN FOR EAST BAY MUD. FIRST THE PRESSURIZATION IF WE CAN'T PUMP WATER TORE STORAGE TANKS THE WATER SYSTEM COULD DEPRESSURIZED. A DEPRESSURIZED SYSTEM CAN ALLOW EXTERNAL CONTAMINANTS DRAW INTO THE PIPES AND RESULT IN UNSAFE WATER SUPPLY AND BOIL WATER NOTICE AS- SECOND IF WE CAN'T MAINTAIN PRESSURE WE WON'T BE ABLE TO PROVIDE WATER FOR FIRE FIGHTING. DURING UP YES YES EVENT THERE CAN STILL BE STRUCTURE FIRES IN OUR SERVICE AREA. WE SAW THIS LAST OCTOBER WHEN FIRE BROKE OUT IN CROCKETT IN LAFAYETTE. MOVING TO THE THIRD PAGE OF YOUR HAND OUT. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE TIMELINE FOR PS PS EVENT FROM A WATER UTILITIES PERSPECTIVE. IT'S NOT JUST THE HOURS OF THE ACTUAL SHOT OFF BUT TE TIME BEFORE AND AFTER THE OUTAGE. WHEN A PS PS OF IT IS ANNOUNCED WE HAVE TO START PAYING FOR EVENT INCLUDE CONNECTING BACKUP EQUIPMENT. AT THE AFFECTED FACILITIES. DURING THE EVENT AND WHILE THE SYSTEM IS BEING RE ENERGIZED WE HAVE TO MONITOR SYSTEM IN IT ADMIN. WHEN THE EVENT AND WE HAVE THE MOBILE WHAT PARK MEANT. LOOK AT LYME. TWENTY FOUR TO SEVEN TO OUR PS PS AN ACTUALLY READ IN SOME BETWEEN. TO NINE DAYS OF IMPACT TO A WATER UTILITY. MOVING TO LOS PAGER HAND OUT IN TWENTY NINETEEN P. GINNY HAD A P. S. P. S. EVENTS. FOR POTENTIALLY AFFECTED EAST BAY MODE FACILITIES. THE FIRST WAS ON OCTOBER NINTH THAT AFFECTED A HUNDRED THIRTY SIX OF OUR FOUR HUNDRED PLUS FACILITIES INCLUDING TWO WATER TREATMENT PLANTS AND EIGHTY FOUR PUMPING PLANTS AND RESERVOIRS. THE SECOND ON OCTOBER TWENTY SIX WAS THE LARGEST AND AFFECTED TWO HUNDRED SIXTEEN FACILITIES FOR WATER TREATMENT PLANTS AND OVER A HUNDRED IMPLIES THE RESERVOIRS. THIS PS PS OF ALSO AFFECTED A NUMBER OF OUR UP COUNTRY FACILITIES. THE LAST TWO EVENTS WERE EVENTUALLY CANCELED FOR OUR AREA. THE TABLE BELOW ON THAT LAST PAGE OF YOUR HAND OUT SHOWS THE COSTS THAT WERE INCURRED DURING THE OCTOBER CAST YES ABOUT. THESE WERE SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES THAT WERE NOT BUDGETED ARE PLANNING RESPONSE MOUNTED TO ALMOST ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND EVEN THOUGH THE LAST TWO EVENTS WERE CANCELED IT'S STILL COST US PREPARE AND PLAN FOR POTENTIAL EVENTS. SO WHAT BACK AND LOOKING AT WHY WE WERE SUCCESSFUL ON THERE ARE THREE REASONS WE PREPARED WE ACTED AND WE COMMUNICATED A LOT. OUR PREPARATION BEGIN IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AND BUILT ON OUR EXISTING EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PROGRAM. WE CONDUCTED TABLE TOP AND FIELD EXERCISES RECORDED WITH CITIES IN OUR SERVICE AREA AND COUNTY EMERGENCY OPERATION CENTERS. WE PREPARED A SPECIFIC MITIGATION A RESPONSE PLAN FOR YES YES THE VENTS. NOW EARLY OUR- WE LIST AND STATE TWENTY NINE GENERATOR IN ADVANCE OF THE TWENTY NINETEEN WILDFIRE SEASON WHICH WAS COSTLY AND NOT BUDGETED. AND WE DEVELOPED SENSE OF COMMUNICATION STRATEGY WE MET WITH THE COMMUNITY AND OUR NEIGHBORING UTILITIES WE PREPARED MESSAGES IN ADVANCE TO OUR EMPLOYEES ELECTED OFFICIALS AND OUR CUSTOMERS. USE SOCIAL MEDIA INCLUDING TWITTER AND FACEBOOK AND TRADITION TRADITIONAL NEWS MEDIA. WE POSTED TIMELY INFORMATION ON OUR WEBSITE. FOR BOTH EVENTS IN OCTOBER WE SENT EMAILS TO OVER SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND CUSTOMERS AND NOTIFIED OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND RESIDENCES BY NEXT DOOR. LASTLY WE WERE PERSISTENT IN OUR EFFORTS TO COORDINATE WITH THE I. O. U. LOOKING FORWARD TO TWENTY TWENTY AND BEYOND WE HAVE THREE MAIN FOCUSES IN THE NEAR TERM. COST REIMBURSEMENT BETTER COMMUNICATION AND NEARING THE SCOPE OF PS PS EVENTS. OUR RESPONSE COSTS ARE NOT BUDGETED AND ARE SIGNIFICANT. EAST BAY MOD IS A PUBLIC AGENCY OUR COSTS ARE BORNE BY RATE PAYERS WHEN OUR COSTS GO UP OUR RATES GO UP. IT WILL BE HELP. FOR THE LAST TO CONSIDER EMBARRASSMENT TO MINIMIZE IMPACTS OUR RATE PAYERS. SECOND FREQUENT COMMUNICATION AND INFORMATION SHARING IS CRITICAL TO A SUCCESSFUL RESPONSE PUBLIC SAFETY PARTNERS LIKE EAST BAY MUD SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN DALY INSTANT BRIEFING CALLS CONVENE BY I OWE YOU BEFORE AND DURING. THIS EVENT. AND WE SEE MANY ADVANTAGES TO EATING WITH THE EYE ARE YOU AND OUR PUBLIC SAFETY PARTNERS PRIOR TO THE START OF EACH FIRE SEASON. FINALLY WE BELIEVE A MORE SURGICAL APPROACH. TO PS PS OFFENSE IS NEEDED. THE PS PATH EVENTS LAST FALL IN OUR SERVICE AREA WE'RE VERY BROAD. WE HOPE THERE'S A WAY TO LIMIT THE SCOPE OF THE OUTAGES IN A MORE TARGETED MANNER. THEY EVEN WITH MORE SEARCH A SURGICAL APPROACH WE CONTINUE TO NEED GENERATORS. WHILE THE USE OF DIESEL GENERATORS RUNS COUNTER TO OUR AGGRESSIVE CLIMATE POLICIES AND GREENHOUSE REDUCTION GOALS. THERE IS IMPORTANT REALITY. WE MUST HAVE RELIABLE BACKUP ENERGY SOURCES AND THE SOURCE NEEDS TO BE PORTABLE. SO THEY CAN BE MOVED QUICKLY AND RESPOND TO THE CHANGING CONDITIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT PS PS IS NOT A LONG TERM SOLUTION AND WE HOPE TO CPS PS PHASED OUT. AS FIFTY IMPROVEMENTS ELECTRICAL ITEMS. TODAY FOR UP TO. OR PERHAPS ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE NEXT PRESENTER. GOOD MORNING GARCIA VICE CHAIR TO AND OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR THE FOR FOCUSING THE ATTENTION OF THIS COMMITTEE ON THE IMPORTANT AS A P. S. P. S. IMPACTS ON WATER AGENCIES. AS MICHAEL MADE ON THE GENERAL MANAGER CALAVERAS COUNTY WATER DISTRICT- WE SERVE A RURAL AREA ON THE EASTERN EDGE IT RANGES FROM THE EASTERN EDGE OF THIS YEAR AS OF THE WEST SLOPE SIDE EASTER HAD TO THE CENTER. OF THE WEST LOOP OF THE ERRORS. WE TAKE SEPARATE DREAM PERSISTENCE AND THIRTEEN WASTE WATER FACILITIES WHERE PEAK P. GINNY SERVICE TERRITORY AND WITHIN THEIR TIER THREE AREA WHICH IS CONSIDERED EXTREME RISK. WILD FIRES A- LANDSCAPE DOLLARS. IN INCLUDING TWENTY FIFTEEN FIRE THAT WAS BY GINNY AND BURNED OVER SO FIVE ACRE. EASY HAS ENTERED FOR PS PS EVENTS WITH THE FIRST OCCURRING IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AND RESPONSE TO WARNINGS FROM P. GINNY. IN THE SPRING OF TWENTY NINETEEN THE P. S. P. S. EVENTS WOULD BE LARGER AND MORE FREQUENT. CCW DEVELOPED AN EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN SPECIFIC TO P. S. P. S. EVENTS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE A PS PS EVENT AS AN EMERGENCY IN AND OF ITSELF REGARDLESS OF WHETHER A FIRE OCCURS. ARMOR AGENCY ACTION PLAN CAN TELL DESCRIPTION BACK UP GENERATORS AVAILABLE FOR EACH FACILITY INCLUDING ONSITE AND STAND BY GENERATION AND PORTABLE TRAILER MOUNTED JENNER IS THERE ARE BEING PARAMETERS AND STATUS. IT ALSO INCLUDES MUNITY OUTREACH EFFORTS AND COORDINATION WITH EMERGENCY RESPONSE AGENCIES AND OTHER LOCAL AGENCY IN THE AREA. ALL OF OUR GENERATORS ARE FUEL TO HAS THERE CURRENTLY IS NO PRACTICAL COST EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVE. OUR PS PS EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN ALSO CONTEMPLATES STAFFING OPTIONS FOR THE SUBSTANTIAL REFUELING EFFORT THAT IS REQUIRED DURING PS. VENTS AND FOR A WASTE WATER FACILITIES THAT MUST BE POPPED USING A PUMP TRUCK THANK YOU YES OF. WHAT WASTE WATER SPELLS MANY OF OUR WASTE WATER LIFT STATIONS ARE LOCATED NEAR LAKE TALUK OR OTHER LOCAL WATER WAYS THAT ALSO SERVED AS THE LOCAL DRINKING WATER SUPPLY. IN ALL SEASON HE HAS NEARLY EIGHTY STAND BY AND PORTABLE GENERATORS FOR A TREATMENT PLANTS PUMP STATIONS SKATER EQUIPMENT AND OTHER CRITICAL FACILITIES THAT OTHERWISE WOULD NOT FUNCTION WITHOUT P. GINNY POWER. OUR GOAL IS TO PROVIDE AN UNINTERRUPTED WATER AND WASTEWATER SERVICE THROUGH THE P. S. P. S. EVENTS. AND IT'S A TESTAMENT TO OUR HARD WORKING CREWS THAT DESPITE THE DIFFICULTY OF OPERATING WATER AND WASTEWATER FACILITIES WITHOUT ELECTRICITY- OR AND RUNNING ON BACKUP GENERATORS WE HAVE NEARLY PERFECT RECORD. THE FIRST PS PS SEVEN OCT IN. A TWENTY EIGHTEEN ONLY AFFECTED A SMALL SERVICE AREA BUT SERVE AS A WARNING FOR WHAT WAS TO COME. THE SECOND AND THIRD EVENTS IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY NINETEEN. AFFECTED ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF OUR FACILITIES. WHICH STRAINED OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN WATER AND WASTEWATER SERVICE. THE FOURTH EVENT TOOK ALL OF CALAVERAS COUNTY OFFLINE INCLUDING 1100% OF OUR FACILITIES. IT WAS DURING THE LAST. THIS LAST EVENT THAT WE ARE FORCED INTERNET INTERRUPT WATER SERVICE TO A SMALL NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS. THE KEY POINT THAT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE HERE IS THAT P. S. P. S. EVENTS ARE NOT THE SAME AS A TYPICAL POWER OUTAGE. POWER OUTAGES OCCUR CAN OCCUR ANY TIME AND FOR ANY NUMBER OF REASONS. AND WE'RE CERTAINLY NO STRANGER TO POWER OUTAGES ESPECIALLY IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF OUR OF OUR COUNTY. THOSE OUTAGES HOWEVER ARE TYPICALLY LIMITED IN DURATION AND IN GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE. YES YES EVENTS ARE AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT CREATURES THAT HAVE FORCED US TO PURCHASE NEW BACKUP GENERATORS AND INSTALL ADDITIONAL FUEL STORAGE CAPACITY THROUGHOUT OUR DISTRICT. YES BECAUSE OF ITS ALSO TEND TO IMPACT LARGE AREAS WHICH MEANS THAT THE DEMAND FOR FUEL AND FOR FEEL TRANSPORTATION PEAKS AND RESURGENT RENTAL GENERATORS ARE SIMPLY NOT AVAILABLE. THE LACK OF AVAILABILITY OF A RENTAL GENERATOR IS NOT MERELY AN INCONVENIENCE BUT IT CAN ALSO MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES EXTREMELY VULNERABLE TO CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE RISK. DURING THE FIRST PS PS EVENT LAST YEAR. EARLY IN THE MORNING OF OCTOBER TENTH TWENTY NINETEEN THE SIX HUNDRED KILOWATT BACKUP GENERATOR AT FOR A COMPARABLE TREATMENT PLANT FAILED. ARTS FOR THE GENERATOR AND COULDN'T BE COMPLETED FOR SEVERAL DAYS AND WE ESTIMATED THAT ARE TREATED WATER STORAGE WOULD LAST ABOUT TWENTY FOUR HOURS. MORE IMPORTANTLY AND I REALLY CAN'T STRESS THIS ENOUGH BUT LIKE MOST WATER SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA THE FIRE HYDRANTS IN COMPARABLE IS ALSO RELY ON THAT TREATMENT PLANT AND THAT JUST THAT SAME DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM FOR WATER PRESSURE. SO WHILE ARE TREATED WATER STORAGE WOULD HAVE LASTED ABOUT TWENTY FOUR HOURS SIMPLY FOR CONSUMPTIVE PURPOSES IF A FIRE HAD BROKEN OUT IN THAT COMMUNITY ON THAT DAY. THE FIRE THE WITH THE WATER WOULD NOT IT WOULD OUR TANKS WERE DRAINED MUCH FASTER THAN THAT. AND THAT'S IT THAT'S ALL THERE IS FOR WHAT FOR FIRE FIGHTING WATER IN THAT COMMUNITY- THERE'S NO BACK UP WATER SUPPLY FOR FIRE HYDRANTS. AND THIS IS ON A DAY OF COURSE THAT P. JEANNIE HAD DETERMINED TO BE A RED FLAG WARNING. FOR SEVERE WILDFIRE RISK. AND THE HYDRANTS VERY WELL COULD HAVE RUN DRY SHOULD HAVE FIRE OF OCCURRED. AND THE CONSEQUENCES IN CATASTROPHIC WE SOUNDED THE ALARM TO EVERYONE WHO WOULD LISTEN- EARLY THAT AFTERNOON CALLOW YES WHO WOULD IT CALAVERAS SO YES IS AND CAL CALIFORNIA- YES AND SCOURED THE STATE FOR GENERATORS INFORMED US THAT THEY HAD FOUND A TWO MEGAWATT TRAILER MOUNTED GENERATOR THAT WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT THEY COULD FIND IT WAS AVAILABLE AND UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS A TEXT AND- WOULDN'T BE HERE IN TIME. OUR NOR RELIABLE DOES RAIDER RENTAL VENDOR- TO THE ONLY AVAIL AVAILABLE GENERATOR THAT THEY COULD FIND WAS AN EIGHTY TOTAL WATT GENERATOR. AND SAN DIEGO WHICH WAS NOT NEARLY LARGE ENOUGH OR CLOSE ENOUGH. THE AVAILABILITY BACKUP GENERATORS IS ONE OF THE KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN P. S. P. S. EVENTS AND A TYPICAL POWER OUTAGE. IN THE END IT WAS P. GINNY THAT EVENTUALLY CAME THROUGH WE LEARNED THAT AFTERNOON THE P. JEANNIE HAD CONTRACTED WITH CERTAIN GENERATOR VENDORS TO MAKE BACKUP GENERATORS AVAILABLE. OF FOR CRITICAL HEALTH AND SAFETY EMERGENCIES A CONTRACTOR FOR P. GINNY DELIVERED A SIX HUNDRED KILOWATT GENERATOR THAT NIGHT AND OUR TREATMENT PLANT BACK ON LINE AROUND TEN PM. OUR PARENTS AND PROP LAST YEAR. WE HIGHLIGHTS THE VULNERABLE POSITIONS OF OUR COMMUNITIES. WHEN WATER AGENCIES ARE FORCED TO OPERATE ON BACKUP GENERATORS BUT IT ALSO PROVIDES A CASE STUDY IN THE LIABILITY SHIFTING THAT OCCURS DURING P. S. P. EVENTS. DID YOU NEED THE OTHER NOBODY'S IMPLEMENTING P. S. P. S. IN PART TO REDUCE THEIR EXPOSURE FROM LIABILITY TO CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. FOR THEIR SHORT SHAREHOLDERS AND FOR THEIR BOTTOM LINE BUT THAT LIABILITY DOESN'T DISAPPEAR IT SHIFTS THE CHIPS TO. PUBLIC AGENCIES IN THIS CASE. AND CALVET AND CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES FACE STRICT LIABILITY FOR FIRE DAMAGE THAT OCCURS- IF THE FIRE SPREADS AS A RESULT OF LOS A PRESSURE OF FIRE HYDRANTS EVEN IF THE WATER AGENCY WAS AT NO FAULT AT ALL. SO IF A FIRE HAD SPREAD. POPULOUS IN OCTOBER TENTH LAST YEAR. THE LIABILITY COULD WEAR IT VERY WELL HAVE BEEN SEA CWD IN OUR RATE PAYERS NOT BE GINNY. WHETHER OR NOT. SUBJECT WATER AGENCIES DISTRICT LIABILITY FOR FIRE DAMAGE. THAT IS NOT THEIR FAULT IS A TOPIC THAT DESERVES ITS OWN SEPARATE HEARING BUT FOR THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE I BELIEVE IT'S FAIR TODAY AND MORE ASSISTANCE. FOR CRITICAL PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE FROM INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES. THEIR BOTTOM LINE IMPROVES BY SHIFTING ABILITY FROM THEM ON TO US. AND WE ARE NOT EQUIPPED FOR FREQUENT ALONG TO PSP S. EVENTS. WE NEED MORE GENERATORS. AND WE NEED FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE RULE OVER TIME BECAUSE- AND THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH. YES IN ADDITION TO GENERATORS. RESOURCES WE SHOULD EMPLOY THE I USED TO FOCUS THEIR INVESTMENT IN HARDENING THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE ON THE CIRCUITS THAT SERVE THE CRITICAL PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE SUCH AS HOSPITALS PUBLIC SAFETY AND WATER. FOCUSING EFFORTS ON THOSE SIR COULD REDUCE THE DOWNTIME FOR A CRITICAL PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPERA OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY AND I WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE. I THANK YOUNG OPEN IT UP TO FROM MY COLLEAGUES. QUESTION AT THANK YOU FOR THAT DETAILED INFORMATION AND THANK YOU TO THE EAST BAY FOR THE NUMBERS TO HELPS BRING IT IN PERSPECTIVE- WE JUST HEARD ABOUT THE IDEA OF REQUIRING THE LEAST PAY FOR SOME OF THESE COSTS ARE ALL OF THESE COSTS IN IT I THINK YOU'RE THE EP MADE A COM AT THE STATE HELPING WITH THESE COSTS IS THAT YOUR HOPE. I'LL AT THE STATE WILL HELP MAN. SEE LIKE MY BUTLER TO. PROPOSED YEAH I'M NOT I THINK THERE'S A BIRTHDAY TO LOOK AT THIS BUT YOU KNOW ONE POSSIBILITY IS FOR THE I. O. U. S. TO REIMBURSE THE UTILITIES OF OUR UTILITIES FOR THE COSTS THAT WE IN HER. AND THEN MY OTHER QUESTION WITH HE- IF YOU'RE FACILITIES RUNNING LIKE IT'S NORMALLY DO TO RUN. VERSUS WHEN WE HAVE ALL THESE DIESEL OUR GENERATORS I'M JUST CURIOUS ABOUT. DO WE HAVE A LOT MORE EMISSIONS ARE TALKING ABOUT AS WELL AND THERE IS A LOT MORE PARTICULAR MATTER CARBON AND SO FORTH TO THESE COMMUNITIES. AND DO WE HAVE A LOT OF RESIDENTS IN THERE SO FORTH AND JUST KIND OF CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED STARK WALL OVER. TO FIND THE PROBLEM. YOU KNOW THAT. CRITICAL ISSUE AND AN MORE URBAN A BUT IT IT CERTAINLY IS AN ISSUE FOR US AS WELL AND NOT JUST THE IMMEDIATE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACTS BUT ALSO OBVIOUSLY- EMITTING MORE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND ANY OF US WOULD LIKE- AND THAT'S NOT A SITUATION I DON'T THINK ANY WATER AGENCY WANTS TO BE ME- RUNNING THERE IS OFTEN DIESEL DIESEL GENERATORS- BUT THERE REALLY IS NO CURRENT THE ALTAR TO THAT AT THAT THIS TIME IN AND- YOUR PRE POINT. THANK EITHER OR BOTH. IT'S ALL. I BELIEVE THAT THE I. O. U.'S SHOULD SHARE THE COST OF THIS RISK OF THESE IMPACT BUT WHAT THE STATE MAKING GRANT MONEY AVAILABLE IN THE NEAR TERM WOULD ALSO BE INCREDIBLY HELPFUL AND ESPECIALLY- MAKING SURE TO OPEN THAT GRANT THOSE GRANT FUNDS UP TO SPECIAL DISTRICTS IN ADDITION TO CITIES AND COUNTIES. AND ONE OTHER QUESTION FOR THE EAST BAY SO THESE THESE NUMBERS ARE. HELPFUL TO PURCHASE THESE TWO INCIDENCES. THEY HAD A HERO. WE HAVE A BUT THE MY LOOK LIKE IF IT AS THE GETS PASSED TO THE RATE PAYERS LIKE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT A COUPLE DOLLARS FOR EACH OF THESE INCIDENTS ARE TALKING ABOUT. BUT I CAN SPEAK TO IN TERMS OF UP PERCENT RATE INCREASE SO- ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ON THE OPERATING COSTS REPRESENTS ABOUT A POINT 3% RATE INCREASE FOR OUR WATER CUSTOMERS- ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. THANK YOU. IF YOU DON'T MIND AGAIN A SIMILAR LIMITED LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ANSWER THAT SAME QUESTION BECAUSE FOR MUCH SMALLER THE NEWSPAPER BUT OBVIOUSLY- AND FOR. US THAT TO OF THE TOTAL COST LAST YEAR NOT INCLUDING PURCHASING NEW GENERATORS CAME TO ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS- FOR US OF WHAT PERCENT INCREASE IT. ON WASTE WATER RATES IS ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO IT'S A IT'S A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT FOR OUR OPERATING BUDGET THAT THAT WE ALSO DIDN'T BUDGET FOR. AND HAVING TO BUDGET FOR THAT GOING FORWARD. IS ESSENTIAL. OF THE INCREASE WE HAD A SCHEDULED. JUST FORTY. S. THANK YOU. MAY YOU. THE QUICK QUESTION FOR YOU THREE OF IS YOUR ANTI SERVER CENTER SERVICE AREAS BY P. JEANNIE WITHIN THE SPACE IN TO. JUST JUSTIN IS BACK. THANK THANK YOU THE QUESTIONS. THIS IS SO YOU ARE. MOSTLY FROM WATER DISTRICTS SO OTHER THAN IS A MUD IS INCLUDING. HOWEVER ELECTRICITY'S UNDER YOU WILL JURISDICTION. IT IS SPACE ARE NOT JUST THE WATER WHY IS SO A LUXURY CITY AS WELL. WE OUR WATER AND WASTEWATER UTILITY WE DO TO GENERATE POWER- ARE UP COUNTRY FACILITIES THAT WE SELL BUT WE DON'T WE DON'T SELF SERVE ANY OF OUR POWER- EXCEPT FOR OUR WASTE MARK. CAN SELF SERVE SOME POWER. WE DO HAVE SOME- AFFORDABLE TEXT AT SOME FACILITIES THAT CAN OFFSET SOME OF OUR LOAD- BUT NOT THE LOAD ENTIRELY. MRS SO YOU COULD WITH ENOUGH. I HEARD. THERE IS A SOME. BUSINESS MODELER A COMPANY IS A PROPOSED LETTER KNOW WHETHER YOU HEARD ABOUT IT THE SINCE MANY HOMES ARE ARE USING SOLAR PANEL. IS SET GROUP DISTRICT OR EVEN HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION OR CD COULD. DEVELOPER A SYSTEM THAT THE- THEY TIME REGULAR TIME ENERGY EXCESS ENERGY CAN BE STORED. IN THE BATTERY. AND THE BATTERY SYSTEMS OR BE ORDER. CONNECTED AND IT BECOMES A SHOE WHICH ENERGY SOURCE. FOR EMERGENCY SITUATIONS HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT IT WILL IS TO ME THAT IS A EXCELLENT IDEA RATHER THAT USERS. THE BOTTOM PORTABILITY AND THE LIMITED AND THEN ALSO. IN ALMOST WONDERING IN WHAT KIND OF A POLLUTION IT IT GENERATES- IF FOR SO MANY GENERATORS SAW. IN A WIN CALIFORNIA A SO SENSITIVE TO ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES SO I THINK GOOD THIS. IDEA OF A CONNECTING THE NETWORK OF A STORAGE ELECTRICITY STORAGES SYSTEMS THAT THE EACH HOUSE WOULD HAVE I HAVE A SOLAR SYSTEM BUT I DON'T HAVE SOLAR BATTERY. MAY BE THE STATE. CAN PROVIDE THE SOME INCENTIVES OF FOUR OR HOMES TO HAVE FULL. ELECTRICITY'S STORAGE BATTERY SYSTEMS. AND IN EMERGENCY SITUATION AND THAT PARTICULAR AREA IF THIS A HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION OR CD OR UTILITY DISTRICT. OUT WOULD HAVE WHAT ORDER POWELL CONNECTED AND DO YOU HAVE EXCESS POWER YOU CAN USE TO THE FULL WATER PUMPING ETCETERA YEAH I YEAH I THINK THE IDEA OF THE MICROGROOVE SOME IT CERTAINLY IS A POSSIBILITY AND IF AN I OR YOU CAN EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENT A SOLUTION LIKE THAT- WITH THE WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THEM TO DO THAT WE DID LOOK AT YOUR WEATHER OR NOT- ABOUT. HIS BIGGEST. IS A FEW INCHES WE- ARE FIRST WHAT IS VERY HEAVY OBJECT TO PAY IN PER. EVERY DAY BAY MY MOVED ONE POINT THREE BILL POUNDS WATER. WE LOOK OUR FACILITIES ARE PUMP FACILITIES THERE'S NOT A LOT OF SPACE THESE AREN'T VERY LARGE FACILITIES SO WHEN WE SCOPED OUT ON TV SYSTEM. TV PANELS. WOULD COVER AN AREA MUCH LARGER THAN THE PROPERTY THAT WE ACTUALLY OWN- IN ADDITION- YOU HAVE THE BATTERY SO YOU NEED A SYSTEM THAT CAN CHARGE THE BATTERIES DURING THE DAY. AND OPERATE YOUR PUMPS AT NIGHT ON THESE PUMPS ARE FAIRLY LARGE TO MOVE THE AMOUNT OF WATER IN OUR SPACE IS LIMITED SO FOR A UTILITY TO IMPLEMENT PUSH LIKE THAT- IF EITHER ON JUST NOT POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE SPACE- BUT MAYBE YOU TO. BYE HE JIMMY. THERE ARE MICRO GRADES AND SUPPLY MORE RELIABLE POWER BUT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE THE SPACE- OR THAT AND COSTS ARE PRETTY HIGH TO IMPLEMENT A- SO. I THINK COME MY BEST. I'D LIKE CAN I CAN I AM TO THAT THAT WOULD IS A NICE NEW TO ME IS A VERY LISTENING TO THE I RIGHT NOW. THE EMERGENCY SAYS SO YOU pSOURCES TWO OF SUPPLY WATER AND I THINK ENERGY SOURCE OF WE HAD TO WE RELY ON THEM WHEN THE PIZZA THE GENERATOR'S GO UP THIS KIND OF WORK. THE NEW SYSTEM MAY IN A CALL THE- AS SHOWN PANEL NO AS ALMOST ALL OF. IMAGE MACROS. OR NETWORK SYSTEM OR WHATEVER NAME WE CAN COME UP WITH A IN A I FEEL THAT HAS A SOME POTENTIAL TO ME. I'M A DIRECTLY I'LL JUST ECHO A LOT OF WITH MY COLLEAGUES HERE JUST MENTION BUT- BY I DO BELIEVE THAT THE TECHNOLOGY HAS COME A LONG WAYS- IN RECENT YEARS AS FAR AS- STORAGE AND THOSE SORTS OF THINGS BATTERY STORAGE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNER. THE POWER REQUIRE IS FOR WATER WASTEWATER UTILITIES IS ABSOLUTELY ENORMOUS- IN COMPARISON. AND JUST TO GIVE YOU SOME INSIGHT WE ACTUALLY OF THE NWT HOUSE A ONE MEGAWATT SOLAR. FARM OBVIOUSLY IT DOESN'T PRODUCE ANY ELECTRICITY AT NIGHT SO THAT'S A PROBLEM IF YOU HAVE IF YOU HAVE A- PROLONGED KISS PIASTRE OF AN OUTAGE FOR. A DAY OR LONGER SO THAT'S PROBLEMATIC THERE AND LEADS TO THE NEED FOR YOU KNOW A BATTERY BACKUP. THE THIS SO SOLAR FOR. ENOUGH POWER FOR ONE POP. ONE STE IT'S A ONE MEGAWATT TAKES UP FIVE ACRES. AND WE HAVE DOZENS AND DOZENS OF PALM THROUGHOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY SQUARE MILE SERVICE AREA SO THE ONLY PRACTICAL BACK UP POWER FOR UTILITIES AT THIS POINT IS DIESEL GENERATION. I'D I COMPLETELY AGREE THAT IT IS MUCH AS WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A BROTHER RELIABLE MICHAEL GRADE SOLUTION AVAILABLE TO US WAS CLEANER IT'S THE STATE A TECHNOLOGY RIGHT NOW IS SIMPLY NOT THERE IT'S NOT PRACTICAL IT'S NOT EFFECTIVE AND THE AND YOU SIMPLY. ESPECIALLY FOR. AN ARTS IN OURWE HAVE FACILITIES SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE THOUSAND MILE. SQUARE MILE COUNTY- WITH WITH A RELATIVELY SMALL COMPARED LIAM RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF RATEPAYERS. AND THE COST OF TRYING TO FIND A MIKE GETS SENT TO ALL OF THOSE FACILITIES- IT JUST IT JUST UNFORTUNATELY IS NOT PRACTICAL.% RIGHT PLEASE. SO DURING THE PS PS IS ARE YOU FACED WITH FINES RIGHT NOW AND RUN TIME. RESTRICTIONS DOES THAT. ABOUT SO L. B. M. W. D. WE HAVE NOT. BEEN SUBJECT TO ANY FINES FORTUNATELY WE'VE COME CLOSE. THE TO SPEAK TO THE RUN TIME RESTRICTIONS- OLDER GENERATORS TO DEPENDS ON THE SIZE AND HOW OLD THE GENERATOR IS AND WHAT CLASS RAN. WE HAVE A TWENTY HOUR PER YEAR MAXIMUM RUNTIME FOR MAINTENANCE PURPOSES JUST TO MAKE SURE IT'S GONNA BE OPERATIONAL WHEN THERE IS AN EMERGENCY. SO WE'VE MANAGED TO AVOID FINES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED LONGER RUN TIME FOR TESTING AND MAINTENANCE AND THAT'S PART OF OUR LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL. AS FAR AS ACTUAL EMERGENCY WILL SEE WE IN OUR SITUATION THE ONE LOOK THE ONE FACILITY THAT. WE LOST POWER FROM LIKE RED FOR A PROLONGED PERIOD TIME. A IN HIS OLDER GENERATORS THERE'S A TWO HUNDRED HOUR MAX RUNTIME CáC. THIS PARTICULAR FACILITY FORTUNATELY WE GOT A MOBILE GENERATOR THAT WAS. PERMITTED THROUGH- AT THE STATE LEVEL SO NOT THROUGH THE LOCAL REGIONAL AIR QUALITY CONTROL BOARD DOWN SOUTH- BUT SO FORTUNATELY WERE ABLE TO GET A GENERATOR RUN THE FACILITY THAT TILL HE WAS DOWN SIX. WHICH FAR AS TO HUNDRED HOURS. SO IT'S JUST SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND THERE IS A LOT OF COMPLICATIONS WITH. WITH THESE GENERATORS AND JUST SOME OF THE RESTRICTIONS THAT WERE FACED WITH. Q. I DO HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS IN ALL START WITH THE MICHAEL OF KIND OF WITH A CONTRAST TO THE CHALLENGES THAT MAY BE THE BIGGER URBAN AREAS HAVE VERSUS SOME OF THE MORE RURAL AREAS CAN YOU MAYBE HIGHLIGHTS SOME OF THOSE CHALLENGES THAT YOU SEE BEFORE YOU THAT ARE A BIT DIFFERENT. HI THE BROKEN UNITY CHALLENGES AGAINST AND YOU MENTIONED SOME OF COSTS RIGHT AND- BEING ABLE TO KIND OF SPREAD THAT DROP OUT BUT- ARE THERE ANY OTHER. AREAS A YUBA COULD POTENTIALLY HIGHLIGHT THAT WOULD REFLECT OTHER WATER AGENCIES AND FIND THEMSELVES IN MORE RURAL PARTS OF THE STATE. IT COST IS DEFINITELY A BIG ONE- ALTHOUGH IN THIS CASE I AT A LOT OF THE EXAMPLES THAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE MENTIONED SOUND VERY FAMILIAR TO ME WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE HAD ALSO. HOW WE MAINTAIN AND OPERATE. OUR GENERATOR- A LOT OF THE SAME EXPERIENCES- I WOULD SAY THE OTHER CHALLENGE FOR US STAFFING WE HAVEN'T. COMPLY OUR OUR FULL TIME STAFF IS SIXTY SIX EMPLOYEES. ABOUT FORTY FIVE OF THOSE ARE OPERATIONAL- AND THE EFFORT THAT WOULD STICK BALL CAN KEEP ALL OF OUR GENERATORS FUELED. PUMPING NOW ALL OF OUR WASTE WATER. IT PUTS AN INCREASE. IN ON A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF YOUR MAKE AND ELECT. AND THAT WE HAVE AND SO THEY ENDED UP WORKING EXTREMELY LONG DAYS- DURING THESE P. S. P. S. EVENTS AND SO NOT ONLY THE OVERTIME COSTS TO THE DISTRICT- BUT IT AT A CERTAIN POINT YOU START TO WORRY ABOUT SAFETY. AND THE IMPACT ON YOUR CRUISE. IT EAST BAY THE MEAN. UTILITIES ANY ERA OTHER IT. LONG TERM INVESTMENTS THAT- THE AGENCY HAS BEEN MAKING ARE. PROJECTING TO MAKE. RELEVANT TO THE SUBJECT AT HAND. YEAH I MEAN I THINK YOU'RE WORTH CERTAINLY LOOK AT ALL OUR PUMP STATIONS WE DO HAVE PERMANENT BACKUP POWER AT ALL OF OUR TREATMENT PLANTS IN OUR MAJOR PUMPING PLANTS- AND YOUR WE DIDN'T KNOW GOING INTO THE TWENTY THAT LAST YEAR'S YES PS WHAT TO EXPECT FROM PEACE IN A- DID A LOT ANALYSIS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE IN. WOULD BE POWER OUTAGES AND I THINK IT'S CERTAINLY HIGHLIGHTED CERTAIN FACILITIES THAT WE MIGHT WANT TO INSTALL PERMANENT BACKUP POWER OUT- BUT WE STILL BELIEVE THAT FLEXIBILITY IT'S ALL JUST BETWEEN THE OCTOBER NINTH IN THE OCTOBER TWENTY. THE CONDITIONS CAN CHANGE QUICK. WE HAVE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE VERY NIMBLE AND MOVE EQUIPMENT AROUND- THE RISK OF INSTALLING PERMANENT. PORTABLE POWER IS THAT WE CAN'T MOVE PERMANENT PARTIAL POWER. PERMITTED POWER AROUND SO WE DO NEED THAT TYPE OF FLEXIBILITY BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN AREAS WERE WILL PROBABLY INVEST. PERMANENT POWER. QUESTION FOR ANY AND ALL. OF THE SOME OF THESE ON THE PREVENTIVA SIDE FROM STATE ARE THERE SPECIFIC UP PROGRAMS POTS OF MONEY THAT YOU LOOKED AT IN OF SOUL WHAT ARE THE- DIFFICULT TO ACCESS AND THAT WOULD CARRY WE WERE TALKING ABOUT MORE RESOURCES ACROSS THE BALLROOM HAVE THIS CONVERSATION BUT- CIVIC PROGRAMS ALREADY. OUT THERE THAT THEY WILL TAKE A LOOK AT A TO BE ABLE TO CONSIDER ENHANCING THOSE- BUDGETARY. LINE ITEMS OR ARE THERE CHALLENGES EVEN FOR THAT MATTER ACCESSING THOSE PROGRAMS WHETHER BE A SMALLER ROLE. FOR THAT MATTER. SOME OF THE MORE URBANIZED THAT WATER AGENCIES. THE ONE THAT COMES AMONG THE IS IT. THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AT THE GOVERNOR'S BALL. INCLUDED LAST YEAR- FOR PS PS RESPONSE WITH LIMITED TO CITIES AND COUNTIES- TO DISTRICTS NOT ABLE TO LIVE FOR THAT MAY OKAY. THIS UNDER IS. THAT THEY HAVE BEEN A GOV PROPOSED BUDGET IN ITS WITH A FIFTY NINE DOLLARS FOR P. PS. OPEN SPECIAL. IN THAT SAME- PART OF MONEY SO- IN MY OPINION I THINK FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IS GOING TO GO VERY QUICKLY AND THEN THAT. I THINK IT WOULD BE. A GOOD- USE OF RESOURCES TO INCREASE THAT THAT. IN THE BUDGET WHO KNOWS. THAT WELL I'M I'M AWARE SOME FUNNY AND GRANT FUNDING THROUGH FEMA- WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY NOT THE STATE LEVEL SO WE'VE WE'VE BEEN SEEKING OUT SOME OF THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY INSTALLING SEVERAL FIX EMERGENCY GENERATORS THAT ARE MORE CRITICAL FACILITIES AND- WE ARE ACTUALLY BANG OR TOLL REFORM. IT GAVE MEGAWATT SOME ANOTHER TWENTY. BUT AGAIN THAT THAT HAS LIMITATIONS. YEAH I WOULD JUST ADD I MEAN THE TYPE BUT MICHAEL TALK ABOUT WE DID APPLY FOR A DEMOCRAT AND WE WERE- IT WAS DENIED. OKAY I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE AGAIN. WITH US AND PROVIDE INSERT VERY CRITICAL INFORMATION TO US THANK YOU. WILL CALL THE- PANEL AND THE FINAL- PRESENTATIONS FOR THIS HEARING- LISA. HE REGION- FOR CARE THE CALIFORNIA WATER AND WASTEWATER AGENCY RESPONSE NETWORK. THE PROGRAM MANAGER FOR THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO DEPARTMENT OF UTILITIES WELCOME. AND JULIE BISHOP PAUL SENIOR LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE- FOR THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIAWATER AGENCIES THAT YOU MAY BEGIN YOUR PRESENTATION WHEN YOU'RE READY. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT CAL WARRANT AND HOW IT BENEFITS THE P. S. P. S. AS WELL AS ITS RECENT USE IN THE CALIFORNIA FIRE. TAKE AWAY FROM TODAY PRESENTATION IS IT IS THAT. CAL WARREN CAN SPEED UP THE PROCESSFOR EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE STREAMLINE IT AND YOU CAN AT SAID AB REQUEST CAL WARN IF YOU'RE A MEMBER. FOR ANYTHING OTHER IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE AN EMERGENCY. MY NAME IS LISA THE SKI AND I'VE BEEN WITH THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO UTILITY APARTMENT FOR SIX YEAR I CURRENTLY A STEERING. MAY MARIN. AND HAVE SOME OF THE PAST THREE YEARS. GIVEN INSTRUCTION AND UP AS INDICATIONS REGARDING HOW WORN. SO WHAT IS MORNING. MARIN IS THE CALIFORNIA WITH WATER. HE WAS NETWORK. IT'S MADE UP. FOR A UTILITY AN DIFFERENT AGENTS. AND THEY HAVE SUCH A COLLECTIVE OF. HE MET FOR ME THEY TOOL. IT'S HOW WARNED OF A UP THIS OF CALIFORNIA FOR AND TO FIVE REGIONS I HAPPEN TO BE THE CHAIR FOR REGION FOUR WHICH EXTENDS FROM THE NORTH NUMBER THAT A COUNTY TO THE SOUTH OF STANISLAUS- WEST IS YELLOW AND THEN EAST TO HELP. THERE ARE ALSO. WARNED OFF STATES INCLUDING CANADA AND MEXICO AS WELL. I MENTIONED EARLIER TO THE BENEFITS THAT I HOPE YOU TAKE AWAY TODAY IS- TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS FOR EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE THROUGH CAL WORN AS BEING A MEMBER AS WELL AS OF THAT YOU CAN REQUEST CAL WORN DENTS EVEN IF IT ISN'T AN EMERGENCY I'D LIKE TO GO THROUGH EACH OF THOSE A LITTLE BIT IN DETAIL. FOR THE FIRST ONE THE EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE A STREAMLINING IN THE NORMAL PROCESSES A WATER AGENCY WOULD UTILIZE THEIR SERVICES. I USE ALL THE RESOURCES AND THEN THEY'D REACH OUT FOR THE CITY. AND THEN THEY REACH OUT TO THE COUNTY AND THE STATE AND THE FEDS AND GENERALLY AND ALL OF THAT THERE HAS TO BE SOME SORT OF DECLARATION OF AN EMERGENCY. CAL RAN BOMB ALL WATER AGENCY HOW DO IS GO TO THE WEBSITE WHICH IS W. W. W. DOT CAL WARNED DOT ORG- THEY WOULD REACH OUT TO A CHAIR IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THE CHAIR IN THE REGION. IT'S SUGGESTED THAT IT IS BUT IT DOES TO BE. THEY REACH OUT TO A CHAIR AND THE CHAIR AND THE- REQUESTING AGENCY WOULD WORK ON TYPE OF ASSISTANCE IS NEEDED. AND DATES THAT ASSIST THROUGH THE OF NUMBER LET ME GIVE YOU AN IN. OF HOW QUICKLY THAT WORKED WITH THE- CALIFORNIA EXCUSE ME THE NAPA EARTHQUAKE SO THAT WOULD BE. THE PAGE THAT STATES CAO WARNED SUPPORT TO NAPA EARTHQUAKE. SO THIS IS A TIME LINE RESPONSE WITH CAL WORN. I WON'T GO THROUGH EVERY SINGLE ENTRY BUT I'LL JUST HIGHLIGHTED FUSE SO THE- UP WORTH QUAKE OCCURRED ON AUGUST TWENTY FOURTH TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AT THREE TWENTY IN THE MORNING- OF TEXT MESSAGE WAS REACHED OUT TO THE MAYOR OF THE CITY OF NAPA. TO SEE IF THEY NEED ASSISTANCE CALIFORNIA THEY AT THAT POINT THEY HADN'T ASSESS THE DAMAGES BUT IF YOU LOOK DOWN TO ABOUT NINE FIFTY FIVE. THANK FOR. WAS REQUEST. TO THE PERSON THAT REACHED OUT FROM THE CITY OF NAPA AND BETWEEN- WHEN A I'M AND SIX THIRTY PM. A CONFERENCE CALLS WERE PUT TOGETHER WITH THE CAL WORN MEMBERS TO FIGURE OUT THE TYPE OF ASSISTANCE THAT THEY CAN HELP OUT NAPA. AND BY SEVEN THIRTY THAT IGHT THEY HAD FIVE MUTUAL ASSISTANCE CREWS FROM THREE DIFFERENT AGENCIES READY TO DEPLOY THEM STAY. LESS THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS HE HAD SAID THEY NEEDED. HE OTHER I'D THE BENEFIT OF BEING A COW WORN MEMBER IS THAT IN THE CASE OF A NON EMERGENCY SITUATION. DURING THE P. S. P. S. SHUT OFFS IN OCTOBER WE HAD READ A SEVERAL AGENCIES REACHED OUT TO THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO- TO UP A REQUEST ASSISTANCE FOR POSSIBLE GENERATORS ONE OF THEM WAS HIDDEN VALLEY LAKES. AND WE HAD SET UP A- AGREEMENT RIGHT THEN AND THERE AND SO BY THE TIME THEY NEEDED THAT BACK IN OCTOBER. CONTACTED ME AND WITHIN MORNING TO THE NEW. AT ODD GENERATORS WILL WERE SENT BEING SENT ON THEIR WAY TO HIDDEN VALLEY SO AGAIN- STREAMLINED PROCESS BUT IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE AN EMERGENCY. THE OTHER THING THAT CAL WORN- DOES IS THEY HAVE A WATER SECTOR SAFETY POSITION INSIDE AN EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER AND THESE ARE GENERALLY FOR. A IT CAN ADD THE CITY OPERATIONS CENTER OR THE STATE OPERATION CENTERS AND THAT PARTICULAR POSITION IS A WATER. SYSTEM NOT AGE A PERSON WITH A DIFFERENT KNOWLEDGE FOR THAT TYPE OF WORK. AND THEY HAVE A COUPLE OF TOOLS AVAILABLE AND I'D LIKE TO GO THROUGH THOSE. AND THOSE WERE YOU REFERRED TO MAP. SO THE FOR TOOL THAT THEY HAVE TO THE BENEFIT IS. ONE THAT STATE MAP EQUAL CHANCE AND THIS IS ACTUALLY A MAP FROM THE OF NAPA CINEMA FIRES. AND IT'S A COMBINATION OF THE MAP AND ONE THOUGH THE- IF YOU HAVE AN IT THE GREAT PART IS. FIRE. IN THE- WHAT NURSES MAP IN THE LINES THAT RUN ACROSS OUR CAL WERE SEVEN MAY PUT IN WERE THERE LAW ARE SO IF YOU'RE Y. SECTOR EVEN DEEPER TRYING TO ANALYZE FOR THE ASSISTANCE MIGHT BE NEEDED IN A CATASTROPHIC EMERGENCY YOU CAN LOOK IN IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE A THE CENTER OF THE BLUE I HAVE TO ME. SINCE YOU CAN BUY THE MAP THAT FIRE ALREADY DEVASTATED PART OF THE AREA AND THEN THE WATER SYSTEMS NEAR THAT AREA SO THAT MIGHT BE THE BEST NEED AS FAR AS THAT GOES. THERE IS ALSO IF YOU REFER TO THE NEXT MAP WHICH IS THE CAMPFIRE MAP. AND THIS WAS FROM THE CAMPFIRE AND AGAIN UTILIZING THE SAME. THREE MAPS LAYERED ON TOP OF ONE ANOTHER THIS ONE'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THIS IS ACTUALLY WAS IT A MINUTE IN TESTED AND THEY'RE WORKING ON TRYING TO PERFECT IT. IN IT'S THE GREEN IS HE A WATER SYSTEM MAP FROM DTW THE BLACK IS THE OUTLINE OF THE CALIFORNIA MAP. AND THIS ONE USES A MODUS SATELLITE WHICH DETECTS HEAT SO IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIS PARTICULAR MAP THE CENTER PORTION IS UNFORTUNATELY PARADISE. ALL BURNED OUT BUT TO THE LEFT IS CHICO AND SO YOU CAN TELL THAT MAYBE AND NEXT CONCERN ON THIS MIGHT BE THE CHICO SO. THOSE ARE BOTH A TOOLS THAT ARE AVAILABLE WITH THAT WATER SAFE. SAFETY SECTOR POSITION. IN CONCLUSION I HOPE THAT- WATER AGENCIES WILL BE ENCOURAGED TO JOIN CAL WORN AND I'LL BE WILLING TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS AFTER THE COMMITTEE Q. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND THE STAFF FOR. THE INVITATION TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS HEARING WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE SPECIAL ATTENTION THAT YOU'RE TAKING- TO LOOK AT THE IMPACTS OF PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF SPECIFICALLY ON WATER AND WASTEWATER. MY NAME IS JULIA HALL I'M A SENIOR LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES AKA REPRESENTS OVER FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES AROUND THE STATE COLLECTIVELY. FOR NINE. UP THESE AGENTS SUPPLY EATING WATER REQUIRE. PANEL AMONG EACH STORY IS UNIQUE AND SPECIFIC TO THAT AGENCY THERE'S A NUMBER OF COMMON CHALLENGES THAT EACH AGENCY FACED- THE CENTRAL CHALLENGES FOR THREE K. BRACE FLEXIBILITY FUNDING AND COMMUNICATION. THE FIRST BIG CHALLENGE RELATES TO FLEXIBILITY IN PROVIDING BACKUP ELECTRIC POWER DURING THESE P. S. P. S. EVENTS ATTHE CONVEYANCE DELIVERY AND TREATMENT OF WATER ALL REQUIRE ELECTRICITY ABOUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF CASES SO AN ELECTRIC GRATE IS DE ENERGIZED. WATER AGENCIES HAVE TO PROVIDE THEIR OWN POWER AND CONTINUE TO DELIVERY IT AND HE SAID EXCUSE ME TO CONTINUE TO DELIVER AND TREAT WATER FOR THE PUBLIC- IN A WORST CASE SCENARIO WITHOUT ELECTRICITY THERE'S THE POTENTIAL FOR BOYLE ORDERS TO BE TO THE POP. OUR DELIVERY TO PLEASE STOP OR EVEN FOR ROSS PUBLIC WAYS. AND THE CAL AIR IS FOR LOCAL IT QUALITY MANAGEMENT DOES ARE CHARGED WITH QUALITY GOAL. THERE ARE VERY RIGHT HAVE SOME. ON AIR BUT WATER AGENCY RELY UPON TO FOR BACK POWER THEIR SUBJECT TO THOSE RULES AND STANDARDS. WHAT WATER AGENCIES APPRECIATE THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF THESE REGULATORS. AND THE FLEXIBILITY TO USE ME IN THESE CHAPTERS FOR EMERGENCY EVENTS AS ESSENTIAL. NUMBER RUBIO HAS GRACIOUSLY AGREED TO AUTHOR A BILL ON BEHALF OF AQUA THEY'LL ADDRESS THE NEED FOR FLEXIBILITY DURING P. S. P. S. EVENTS. I WANT TO THANK HER AND HER STAFF AS WELL AS THE STAFF OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR THEIR IN TO WORK ON THE ISSUE. AT A HIGH LEVEL. REPORT CONTAINS A GREAT FLEXIBILITY. THE COAST PROVIDERS NOT JUST WATER AND WASTEWATER IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THREE MAIN GOALS. FIRST TO CONFIRM THAT BACKUP GENERATION DURING PS PS OF THAT IS CONSIDERED EMERGENCY USE OF GENERATORS. SEC TO ENSURE THE GENERAL USE FOR YES PS EVENTS IS NOT WITH ANY TIME PAINS. AND THAT NATIONAL TESTING IN MAKING. IF IT IS GENERAL SINCE THEY'RE BEING PUT UNDER GERMAN AND THAT THEY WERE REALLY. FOR AN WE'RE INTEREST SOLUTION. I BELIEVE. I ALSO FOUGHT OUT IF UNDERSTANDING THAT BY AIR THE END ARE PORTENT FOR HELP AND SAFETY. SECOND MAIN TOWN REALLY STUFF. BUT FOR EVERY MISSILE ABOUT. AND FOR REIMBURSEMENT FOR A HIGH AND BECAUSE INCURRED A RESULT P. S. P. A WELL FUNDING IS ALL CHALLENGING FOR PUBLIC A TO USE ISSUE IS REALLY URGE AND PROCUREMENT OF. GENERATION CAN BE PRETTY LENGTHY. WE APPRECIATE THE FUNDING IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IN THE FORM OF GRANTS ADMINISTERED BY THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES I THINK COUPLE PEOPLE TOUCHED ON THIS LAST YEAR THE BUDGET MADE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE TO CITIES AND COUNTIES PREPARE FOR PS PS- BUT UNFORTUNATELY SPECIAL DISTRICTS IN THERE FOR MANY WATER AGENCIES WERE INELIGIBLE TO. BUY FOR THIS FUNDING. THE PROPOSED. COULD FIT AND ALL. AND IS INTENDED. TO WATER AGENTS AND OTHER SPECIAL DISTRICTS. WE APPRECIATE THE RECOGNITION OF WATER AGENCIES NEEDS IN THIS YEAR'S PROPOSED FUNDING. BUT WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE SMALLER PART OF FUNDING MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE TO MEET THE FULL NEED. THERE ARE OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDING SPREAD ACROSS A NUMBER OF STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES. INCLUDING THE CLEAN AND SAFE DRINKING WATER REVOLVING FUNDS ADMINISTERED BY THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD AND THERE IS SOME THEME OF FUNDING. REQUIREMENTS FROM PATCHING FUNDS AND SOME OF THESE. HOWEVER CAN BE PROHIBITIVE FOR SOME OF OUR SMALL AGENCY. IN ORDER TO AVOID A- INVESTMENTS IN BACKUP GENERATORS WE WOULD ASK THE LEGISLATURE FOR OVERSIGHT OVER HOW THE ELECTRIC ELECTRIC UTILITIES INVEST IN HARDENING THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE. AND HOW THEY PRIORITY CRITICAL FACILITIES THAT PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH AND SAFETY THIS AS- IN ADDITION TO THE NEED FOR INVESTMENTS WATER AND WASTEWATER AGENCIES ALSO ENCOURAGE YOU JUMP BUDGET COSTS IN THE PREPARATION EXECUTION AND AFTERMATH OF THESE PEACE PS EVENTS. THE COSTS ARE MEMBERS ENCOURAGED. THE SMALLER LARGER AGENCIES RANGING FROM THOUSANDS TO TENS OF THOUSANDS AND MAYBE EVEN MORE PER DAY- BASED ON WHAT THEY HAD TO DO TO GET PREPARED. ADDRESSING THESE I'M BUDGET BECAUSE IF YOU'RE- THIRTY OF THE LEGISLATURE AND WE WOULD ASK ANY LET. THAT SEEKS REIMBURSEMENT FOR COSTS INCURRED CONSIDER SPECIAL DISTRICTS. THE FINAL SIGNIFICAN CHALLENGER LEADS TO COMMUNICATION COMMUNICATION WITH THE ELECTRIC UTILITIES BUT ALSO COMMUNICATION WITH OTHER CRITICAL SERVICE PROVIDERS. FOR MEMBERS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON AND PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC TERRITORIES THE LEVEL FREQUENCY AN ACCURACY OF COMMUNICATION WARRANT SOME IMPROVEMENT. YOU PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION RECOGNIZES THAT WOULD BURN WASTE WTER AGENCIES ARE CRITICAL STATE FACILITIES AND THEY'RE EXPECTED TO BE GIVEN ADVANCE NOTICE AND IN A IN ADVANCE OF PS PS. A TIME SOME OF OUR MEMBERS HAD FACILITIES LOSE POWER THAT WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO LOSE POWER AND MANY OF OUR MEMBERS ARE NOTED THERE LOOK TRICITY MAY GO OUT BUT THEY WERE NEVER GETTING CONFIRMATION OUR TIME. AT THIS SPECIFIC. PATIENT ASSIST. FOR WATER. PREPARE FOR AND MAINTAIN RELIABILITY DURING P. S. P. S. EVENTS. MANY THE CHALLENGES I'VE OUTLINED OR NOT YOU NEED TO WATER AGENCIES AND THERE ARE PROBABLY A LOT OF LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS THIS YEAR TO LOOK AT THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE NEEDED ON THE ELECTRIC UTILITY SIDE AND WHERE APPROPRIATE WILL WAIT. ON THAT. AND ONE OTHER PIECE THAT WAS. BY THE LAST PANEL IS THE STRESS ON THE TELECOMS AND NETWORK AND I THINK THAT- THAT HASN'T REALLY BEEN HIGHLIGHTED AS WELL AND I KNOW THAT THEY'RE STRUGGLING WITH SOME OF THESE SAME ISSUES BEING CRITICAL FACILITIES ON WHEN BUT OF OUR WATER AGENCIES RAN INTO ISSUES WHERE THEY COULDN'T COMMUNICATE BECAUSE THEY'RE RLIANT UPON NETWORKS THAT WEREN'T AVAILABLE. I'M SUCH ONE OTHER PIECE ON COMMUNICATION WE'RE ALSO BEING PROACTIVE HOWEVER OUTSIDE OF THE LEGISLATORS FEAR NOT ALL OF THESE TO BE SOLVED BY THE POLICYMAKERS- IF WE CAN HELP YOU GUYS OUT WE'RE TRYING TO DO THAT WE'RE TRYING TO OUR ROADS WITH THEY'LL BE DELIRIOUS SO FOR EXAMPLE LAST WEEK A SMALL CONTINGENT OF OUR BUT- YEAH. IN TOWARD THE EMERGENCE OPERATION ARE MANTA I SAN DIEGO. ELECTRIC TO LEARN FROM WHAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IN ATTENDANCE WERE ALSO REPRESENTATIVES FROM PGA ANY AND AS C. E. WHO WERE THERE TO LEARN FROM WHAT THEY'VE BEEN WORKING ON DOWN IN SAN DIEGO. AND ALSO IT RIGHT IT'S OF THEIR OWN TO OUR MEMBERSHIP. I WILL CONTINUE TO CORDON. UTILITY PARTNERS TO PROVIDE FACE TO FACE OPPORTUNITIES WITH THE WATER COMMUNITY. THESE PEACE PS OF MY EVENTS ALSO HIGHLIGHTED DIFFERENT KIND OF COMMUNICATION CHALLENGE AT LEAST FOR SOME OF OUR MEMBERS- WHICH IS A LACK OF INTEGRATION OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT EMERGENCY RESPONSE LEVEL- WELL THIS ISN'T SOLELY A P. S. P. S. ISSUE PS PS IS HIGHLIGHTED. A THAT THERE'S A NEED FOR BETTER COORDINATION AND INTEGRATION AT THAT LEVEL. BECAUSE IT WE ARE SPECIAL DISTRICTS. COUNTIES OF THE OBSERVE EMERGENCY RESPONSE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND SPOCK STATEWIDE ASSOCIATIONS DEFINE. CAN BETTER PARTNER WORK TOGETHER. ALL THESE CHALLENGES NEED. SO SOME OF THESE. CAN BE A CO. THE PARTNERSHIP. WHILE OTHERS MANY LEGISLATIVE ACTION. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES TO SHARE THEIR STORIES AND FOR ALL QUITE A SURE POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS THESE ONGOING CHALLENGES. AND THEN WITH THAT I'D BE HAPPY WITH ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU OPEN OPEN UP TO SOME QUESTIONS. MARIE QUESTIONS. OKAY HE TOUCHED ON THE FUNDING AND SOME OF THE CENTER CHALLENGES THAT EXIST- WITH THE STATE AGENCIES HOW CAN YOU BE MORE SPECIFIC IF POSSIBLE ON SOME OF THOSE CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE FUNDING BACKS A LEXUS IN THE SIDE FROM THE AMOUNT THAT'S AVAILABLE YES I THINK SO- SO WE WERE AT ACCESS TO THE FUNDING THAT WAS IN THE BUDGET LAST YEAR'S OBVIOUSLY THAT'S A CHALLENGE I THINK. THE RECORD AND THIS YEAR. CONVERSATIONS AS A PRO. AND OTHER FUNDING THE ALREADY SORT OF OUT THERE AVAILABLE THE WHAT REVOLVING FUNDS THAT I MENTION I THINK. WITH THEIR VENDORS WITH THOUGH WHY RESOURCES BOARD THIS FUND WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR THAT I THINK THAT THAT FUNDING IS ALSO INTENDED FOR A MYRIAD OF OTHER THINGS. SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF COMPETING INTERESTS FOR US YOU KNOW AS A CERTAIN PART OF MONEY. AND THAT FLOWS THROUGH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO THE STATE TO ADMINISTER SO I THINK. THERE ARE FUNDING STREAMS. BULL BUT- THERE'S THOSE ARE ALREADY CUT MARCH FOR OTHER ACTIVITIES TWELVE. THERE'S JUST LOOK COME TO MODIFY WHICH THE START OF PUBLIC AGENCIES AND GENERAL. OKAY REGARDING REGIONAL LOOK WORK AT COORDINATION WHAT'S THAT LOOK FROM REGION TO REGION SEVERAL BASS THEY TRY TO BE THE THAT CALIFORNIA'S DIVIDED WITH THE FIVE REGIONS AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE- THEY TRY TO FIRST LOOK. AT THE PART OF THE STATE MEDIA YOU KIND OF COLLECTIVELY LOOK AT WHAT YOU HAVE AVAILABLE WE HAVE THAT TYPE THE METHODS THROUGH MY SO THERE'S SOME OF THAT AGENCIES ASSISTANCE UP THAT THEY CAN UTILIZE IS BASED THAT I YEAH YEAH SHOP TO THE- FOR. THE NEXT NEED THEM THE OTHER OPTIONS AS WELL I. SOMETHING THAT'S COME UP QUITE A IS THE ISSUE JENNA. YES AND DOM WATER AGENTS LOOKING AT OTHER. ALTERNATIVES TO GENERATORS IN OF SO WHERE THEY LOOK LIKE AND- MAYBE IDEA OF COST COMPARISONS- SO WE THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO IS BAD HAS MOST OF THEIR PART POWER BASED ON SPOTTED. A WE ARE USUALLY A ONE YEAR OLD USUALLY THE ONE THAT THEY REACH OUT TO FORTY READY YET AS FAR AS A DIFFERENT SORT FOR ALTERNATIVES. I CAN GET NOW I'M NOT SURE. IT WHAT ARE YOU SEE YES SO FROM LAST THE RIGHT. ABOUT IT PROBLEM AND SO. FOR AN IMMEDIATE SOLUTION CAN BE PRETTY AND PUT IN PLACE I THINK SOME OF THEM TOUCH ON THE FACT THAT SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGY STILL ISN'T QUITE THERE- AND I THINK. YOU'RE DOING IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOME ESPECIALLY SOME OF THESE ARE AGENCIES AND OVER A HUNDRED YLIDES W. FOR DIFFERENT MICROGRAMS THAT YOU NEED TO INVEST IN SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE KIND OF IT THAT WOULD NEED TO GO INTO. THE THING THAT WE NEED TO GO. SB BACK. LONG HAITIAN TO GET THAT IN POTENTIAL I'M A LOT OF ROOM HAVE ANGRY AS INVEST IN A LOT OF TECH I WILL SAY THAT I. THE MINDSET THAT THEY NEEDTO BE THEIR OWN ALL BURKE PROVIDER WAS NOT REALLY PART OF THAT DISCUSSION AT THE TIME IT WAS MORE ABOUT- SELLING BACK TO THE GRANTED OVER CUTTING COSTS AT PEAK TIMES. AND SO ALMOST ALL OF THE MEMBERS AWARE OF THE HAVE INVESTED IN THESE KINDS OF YOU KNOW EITHER STROLLER OR BATTERY OR- COMBINATION. IT'S NOT SET UP TO BE BEHIND THE EAR OR ISLAND IT. SO DURING THESE POWER OUTAGES THEY ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE ACCESS THAT ELECTRICITY AND NOT BACK UP. SO IS THE POTENTIAL TO CONVERT SOME OF THAT AND MAYBE AT CERTAIN VESSEL. PROBE BUT I THINK THAT FOR THE- PART- THAT THAT GENERATED REALLY THE BEST SOLUTION. BASED SO DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT KIND OF A INVESTMENT YOU WOULD NEED AS FAR I MEAN I KNOW FOR A MILLION DOLLARS. LIKE A LOT OF. IN REALITY IT'S NOT DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT. THE NEED IS- I THINK WE NEED TO DO SOME MORE WORK WITH OUR MEMBERSHIP TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF EXACTLY WHAT THEY NEED IS I THINK THE OTHER THING ABOUT AT LEAST AS POSSIBLE OUT OF MONEY. THAT CITIES AND COUNTIES AND OTHERS BUT- ALSO PROBABLY HAVE THAT. NEEDS BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WORKING ON. AND JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE MOST OF THESE ESPECIALLY LARGER GENERATORS ARE CUSTOM BUILT. AT THEIR ANYWHERE FROM FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND TO OVER IN THE- GREATER- AND THEY TAKE. PROBABLY SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR TO ACTUALLY HAVE DESIGNED AND BUILT OUT. SO I THINK WE PROBABLY DO NEED SOME BETTER NUMBERS ON EXACTLY WHAT THE NEED IS. BUT IN FIFTY IN. A LOT LESS. BAR THAT ONE TAKE THAT I MIGHT. SO HAVE WHAT WHAT RETAIN OUT A JUDGE TO FOR A WHOLE SITE FOR IT REALLY DEPEND IT'S ALL VERY FACILITIES SEC- SO THERE THERE'S DIFFERENT WATTAGE THAT YOU MIGHT NEED DIFFERENT I'M THE POWER THEY'RE GOING BUT INTO THAT SYSTEM TO. RUN CAPACITY AND SO IT DEPENDS INDIVIDUAL THE TRYING ON WITH. FOR A TREATMENT PLANT WENT DOWN- THAN THEY NEEDED THE BACKUP POWER THEY WERE ON THE SIZE OF ABOUT THREE FEET THE TWO FORMER FIFTY KILOWATT SO THAT'S KIND OF AN IDEA. THANK YOU. I DON'T HAVE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS IN THE QUEUE AGAIN FOR A SPENDING THIS MORNING WITH US AS WELL AS ALL OF THE OTHER PRESENTERS AND TURN EAGER TO HEAR FROM. THOSE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WILL BE SPEAK.
