01:21:33.321 --> 01:21:34.389
SPECIFICALLY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING

01:21:34.456 --> 01:21:35.857
CONTEMPLATING IS WHETHER IT

01:21:35.924 --> 01:21:37.525
WOULD MAKE SENSE. TO HAVE MULTI

01:21:37.592 --> 01:21:39.194

MUCH ANCILLARY INFORMATION BUT

01:21:51.806 --> 01:21:53.708
THE IDEA THAT YOUR SSN IS USED

SHOULD SERVE THAT PURPOSE. ALSO

01:22:06.421 --> 01:22:08.123
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION

01:22:08.189 --> 01:22:09.291
ABOUT WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS AN

01:22:09.357 --> 01:22:10.492

AND BUILDINGS. ARE THIS WOULD

01:48:08.281 --> 01:48:10.016
REQUIRE THEM TO IDENTIFY WHETHER

SB TWELVE SEVENTY FIVE IS A

02:05:40.466 --> 02:05:41.634
PERMISSIVE BILL THAT WOULD NOT

REQUIRE A STATE AGENCY TO ACCEPT

ONE OF THOSE STATES AND SO HERE

02:06:07.493 --> 02:06:09.962
WE ARE IN TWENTY TWO. VIRTUAL

02:06:10.029 --> 02:06:11.830

VERY NEAR FUTURE. WE SHOULD NOT

02:06:26.912 --> 02:06:28.681
BE AFRAID OF VIRTUAL CURRENCY WE

02:06:28.747 --> 02:06:30.616
SHOULD BE EMBRACING IT. BECAUSE

02:06:30.683 --> 02:06:33.118
IT IS MONEY. IT IS JUST MONEY

02:06:33.185 --> 02:06:35.421

ACCORDING TO DATA FROM HARRIS

INSTITUTIONS ARE ALSO INVESTING

INVESTING HEAVILY IN THIS SPACE

02:07:48.160 --> 02:07:49.795

FOR STATE AGENCIES FOR THE SAME

02:08:01.940 --> 02:08:03.375

THE SERVICE AGENCY. VIRTUAL

02:08:11.650 --> 02:08:13.685
CURRENCY CAN BE USED AS A TOOL

02:08:13.752 --> 02:08:15.788
FOR SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE

02:08:15.854 --> 02:08:17.222

MILLION AMERICANS ARE UNBANKED

02:08:44.483 --> 02:08:46.385

02:08:46.452 --> 02:08:47.986
AVERAGE OF THREE THOUSAND

02:08:48.053 --> 02:08:49.555

BEAR. MANY PEOPLE HAVE RAISED

02:08:54.793 --> 02:08:56.495

LENDING SPACES RIGHT NOW. B.

02:09:10.642 --> 02:09:12.211
THIS BILL WOULD NOT REQUIRE THE

02:09:16.115 --> 02:09:17.883
WERE TO MOVE INDIVIDUAL AGENCIES

A NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT THE BILL

02:11:51.236 --> 02:11:52.904
THE POSSIBILITY THAT CALIFORNIA

COULD SPEAK TO THAT ISSUE WITH

02:22:22.100 --> 02:22:24.302

02:24:58.856 --> 02:25:00.858
IN MY IN MY- MY TIME- I WOULD

02:25:00.925 --> 02:25:03.361
JUST SAY THAT- NOT ALWAYS LIKE

02:25:03.428 --> 02:25:05.129
CALIFORNIA TO BE AND- THE

02:25:05.196 --> 02:25:08.900
INNOVATION STATE AND TO- IT'LL

02:25:08.966 --> 02:25:12.203
BE A LEADER AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES

02:25:12.270 --> 02:25:13.638
. BUT I REMAIN WORRIED AND

02:25:13.704 --> 02:25:16.140
CONCERNED THAT- THAT WE MAY BE

02:25:16.207 --> 02:25:18.109
GOING A LITTLE TOO FAST AND- I

02:25:18.176 --> 02:25:20.545
WOULD LIKE TO. SEE A LITTLE BIT

02:25:20.611 --> 02:25:23.815
MORE STUDY DONE AND MORE-

02:25:23.881 --> 02:25:26.617
CALIBRATED. SMALL BABY STEPS

02:25:26.684 --> 02:25:29.554
INTO THE SPACE- VERSUS THE

02:25:29.620 --> 02:25:31.756
BROADER- AUTHORIZATION THAT

02:25:31.823 --> 02:25:33.391
WOULD BE PROVIDED IN THE BILL

02:25:33.458 --> 02:25:35.093
AND SO I AND- I AM IN A LAYOFF

02:25:35.159 --> 02:25:37.028
THE BILL TODAY AND HOPE THAT- IF

02:25:37.095 --> 02:25:38.496
THE BILL DOES MOVE FORWARD IT-

02:25:38.563 --> 02:25:40.965
IT WEEK. IT CAN BE NARROWED TO A

02:25:41.032 --> 02:25:44.502
PLACE OF A MORE THOUGHTFUL STUDY

02:25:44.569 --> 02:25:47.572
AND CARE. ANYBODY ELSE WISHING

02:25:47.638 --> 02:25:50.308
TO ADDRESS THE BODY ON THIS.

02:25:50.374 --> 02:25:51.809
OKAY CENTER CAMARGO I BELIEVE

02:25:51.876 --> 02:25:53.544
THE BILL'S PREMATURE IT COULD

02:25:53.611 --> 02:25:55.213
LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS FOR

02:25:55.279 --> 02:25:57.515
BOTH THE STATE AND THOSE SEEKING

02:25:57.582 --> 02:26:00.551
TO USE THIS TYPE OF CURRENCY WE

02:26:00.618 --> 02:26:01.919
MUST MAKE SURE THE APPROPRIATE

02:26:01.986 --> 02:26:03.754
SAFEGUARDS ARE IN PLACE AND

02:26:03.821 --> 02:26:05.323
ENSURE THAT CUSTOMERS ARE

02:26:05.389 --> 02:26:08.025
INFORMATION IS WELL PROTECTED

02:26:08.092 --> 02:26:09.494
YOU HAVE BEEN DOLLARS YOURSELF

02:26:09.560 --> 02:26:10.428
ABOUT THE STATE STUDY THAT'S

02:26:10.495 --> 02:26:12.630
COMING THE FEDERAL STUDY THIS

02:26:12.697 --> 02:26:15.666
COMING- I BELIEVE WE SHOULD WAIT

02:26:15.733 --> 02:26:17.535
AND SEE WHAT THOSE STUDIES.

02:26:17.602 --> 02:26:19.437
PRODUCED BEFORE WE MOVE DOWN

02:26:19.504 --> 02:26:21.572
THAT ROAD WAS INTERESTING

02:26:21.639 --> 02:26:23.975
BECAUSE I WAS- ON THE PHONE WITH

02:26:24.041 --> 02:26:25.243
SENATOR COM AUGER THIS MORNING

02:26:25.309 --> 02:26:27.311
PRIOR TO THAT THE TODAY SHOW

02:26:27.378 --> 02:26:29.447
REPORTED THIS MORNING THE CRYPTO

02:26:29.514 --> 02:26:31.349
CURRENCY IS THE SECOND LEADING

02:26:31.415 --> 02:26:34.452
FRAUDULENT AREA IN FINANCE IN

02:26:34.519 --> 02:26:36.721
THE COUNTRY TODAY. THAT IS VERY

02:26:36.787 --> 02:26:39.457
CONCERNING TO ME IS WILL WELL I

02:26:39.524 --> 02:26:41.259
HOPE THAT YOU WOULD AGREE TO A

02:26:41.325 --> 02:26:43.127
WORKING GROUP TO STUDY THIS

02:26:43.194 --> 02:26:44.395
ISSUE AND ALLOW MORE TIME TO

02:26:44.462 --> 02:26:46.597
CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS IT

02:26:46.664 --> 02:26:48.065
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE YOU'RE OPEN TO

02:26:48.132 --> 02:26:50.101
THAT SUGGESTION SO ODD

02:26:50.168 --> 02:26:51.402
UNFORTUNATELY I CANNOT SUPPORT

02:26:51.469 --> 02:26:53.871
THE BILL AS IS SENATOR COM AUGER

02:26:53.938 --> 02:26:58.809
WHICH I DO CLOSE. YES THANK. YOU

02:26:58.876 --> 02:26:59.510
MISTER CHAIR AND I AM.

02:26:59.577 --> 02:27:01.412
WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE AND I'M

02:27:01.479 --> 02:27:03.581
OPEN TO A DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION

02:27:03.648 --> 02:27:05.650
AS I MENTIONED IN MY OPENING IT

02:27:05.716 --> 02:27:07.485
THIS IS A PERMISSIVE BILL AND SO

02:27:07.552 --> 02:27:08.686
THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT OR

02:27:08.753 --> 02:27:11.455
MANDATE. THAT ALL AGENCIES HAVE

02:27:11.522 --> 02:27:13.357
TO START IMMEDIATELY ACCEPTING

02:27:13.424 --> 02:27:16.093
DIGITAL CURRENCY AS PAYMENT-

02:27:16.160 --> 02:27:17.628
THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE

02:27:17.695 --> 02:27:19.297
BETWEEN INVESTING IN DIGITAL

02:27:19.363 --> 02:27:21.132
CURRENCY WHICH I THINK WHERE

02:27:21.199 --> 02:27:23.067
MOST OF THE DISCUSSION LINES.

02:27:23.134 --> 02:27:25.536
AND THEN ACTUALLY USING DIGITAL

02:27:25.603 --> 02:27:28.839
CURRENCY TO PAY FOR SOMETHING-

02:27:28.906 --> 02:27:30.675
THERE'S ALSO A HUGE DIFFERENCE

02:27:30.741 --> 02:27:32.443
BETWEEN ACCEPTING DIGITAL

02:27:32.510 --> 02:27:34.679
CURRENCY IN ITS FORM RIGHT AND

02:27:34.745 --> 02:27:36.948
IT'S DIGITAL FORM. AS OPPOSED TO

02:27:37.014 --> 02:27:39.083
WORKING WITH THIRD PARTY VENDORS

02:27:39.150 --> 02:27:41.252
TO CONVERT IT INTO CASH WE

02:27:41.319 --> 02:27:43.387
ACTUALLY THERE IS A AS A BANK

02:27:43.454 --> 02:27:45.890
HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA-

02:27:45.957 --> 02:27:47.625
THAT ACCEPTS DIGITAL CURRENCY

02:27:47.692 --> 02:27:49.093
AND SO THESE THINGS ARE

02:27:49.160 --> 02:27:50.761
HAPPENING. IN CITIES AND

02:27:50.828 --> 02:27:52.964
COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE AND

02:27:53.030 --> 02:27:55.166
THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS AS I

02:27:55.233 --> 02:27:57.201
MENTIONED TO CREATE A LAUNCHING

02:27:57.268 --> 02:28:00.371
PAD FOR THE STATE TO BEGIN TO.

02:28:00.438 --> 02:28:03.140
INCREMENTALLY OR NOT MOVE INTO

02:28:03.207 --> 02:28:05.409
THIS SPACE AS WELL I WANT TO

02:28:05.476 --> 02:28:07.078
ALSO ADD THAT THE UNITED STATES

02:28:07.144 --> 02:28:08.913
IS TIED FOR TENTH PLACE IN THE

02:28:08.980 --> 02:28:11.315
WORLD IN TERMS OF HOW MANY OF

02:28:11.382 --> 02:28:14.518
OUR CITIZENS ARE RESIDENTS. OWN

02:28:14.585 --> 02:28:19.223
AND USE DIGITAL CURRENCY- THE

02:28:19.290 --> 02:28:21.058
PEOPLE BEEN TALKING ABOUT RISK

02:28:21.125 --> 02:28:22.893
YOU KNOW THE INTERNET IS RISKY

02:28:22.960 --> 02:28:23.661
PEOPLE WERE SCARED ABOUT

02:28:23.728 --> 02:28:25.296
INVESTING IN INTERNET STOCKS IN

02:28:25.363 --> 02:28:27.865
THE NINETIES AND THEN LOOK WHAT

02:28:27.932 --> 02:28:29.834
HAPPENED- AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT

02:28:29.900 --> 02:28:32.503
SUGGESTING. THAT WE DON'T TAKE

02:28:32.570 --> 02:28:34.805
ANY OF THOSE THINGS INTO

02:28:34.872 --> 02:28:35.773
CONSIDERATION IN FACT WHAT I'M

02:28:35.840 --> 02:28:37.475
SUGGESTING IS WHY DON'T WE USE

02:28:37.541 --> 02:28:38.676
THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE

02:28:38.743 --> 02:28:41.746
REPORT THAT ARE IN PROCESS NOW

02:28:41.812 --> 02:28:44.348
TO HELP GUIDE HOW WE CONTINUE TO

02:28:44.415 --> 02:28:46.651
DEVELOP GUARD RAILS. AND YET

02:28:46.717 --> 02:28:48.619
ALLOW FOR THE FLEXIBILITY THAT

02:28:48.686 --> 02:28:51.455
CAN ENCOURAGE THOUSANDS HUNDREDS

02:28:51.522 --> 02:28:52.923
OF THOUSANDS PERHAPS MILLIONS OF

02:28:52.990 --> 02:28:54.759
CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE DIGITAL

02:28:54.825 --> 02:28:56.894
CURRENCY AND WOULD LIKE THAT TO

02:28:56.961 --> 02:28:59.297
PAY FOR A STATE PROVISION. IN A

02:28:59.363 --> 02:29:01.265
WAY THAT IS SAFE IN A WAY THAT

02:29:01.332 --> 02:29:04.402
IS SECURE AND IN A WAY THAT DOES

02:29:04.468 --> 02:29:05.770
NOT EEP BILL. PUSH THE

02:29:05.836 --> 02:29:08.472
LIABILITY OF VOLATILITY ON TO

02:29:08.539 --> 02:29:09.874
THE STATE THERE ARE SO MANY

02:29:09.940 --> 02:29:11.909
OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE OUT THERE

02:29:11.976 --> 02:29:14.011
AND THIS BILL IS JUST ASKING THE

02:29:14.078 --> 02:29:15.680
STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO BE PART

02:29:15.746 --> 02:29:18.516
