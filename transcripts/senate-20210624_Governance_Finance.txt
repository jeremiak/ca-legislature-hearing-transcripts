THAT'S THE QUESTION SO WE HAVE A WE HAVE A MOTION BY THE VICE CHAIR MOTION BY VICE YOU'RE NIELSEN WHERE TO GO TO QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS FROM MAJORITY LEADER HERTZBERG. ZERO THANK YOU JOINT OPPORTUNISTS ASK A SERIES OF QUESTIONS I WANT TO ASK OF. ASSEMBLY MAN HERE. HE'S ACTUALLY REPRESENTS ME AND SO I'M PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN IT THAT PEN READY ASSEMBLY MEMBER THERE AGO. ALREADY GREAT DEAL OF WORK I WANT TO FIRST START OUT. IS WITH RESPECT TO. THIS MEASURE THAT THINKING TO AMANDA'S. THE MARKS RUSA MEASURE. AS YOU MAY KNOW FROM THE DAYS I'M SURE IS A STUDENT OF PUBLIC POLICY AND YOU ARE YOU NEW HOWARD MARKS. NO MILTON MARK STONE GOOD MELTING MILTIE MARKS ON CAMILLUS AGAIN HOWARD MARKS THAT'S- NEW YORK. MILTIE MARKS UNCLE MILTIE MARKS FROM SAN FRANCISCO. REPUBLICAN WHO WAS A- WONDERFUL GENTLEMAN REALLY ACTIVE IN THE COMMUNITY AND CERTAINLY MISTER BRUCE. WHO SERVED HERE IS- SPEAKER PRO TEM AND MAJORITY LEADER IN THE OTHER HOUSE AND SERVED DISTRICT EDUCATION TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT YOU REPRESENT ACTUALLY OVERLAPS LIBERTY OR DISTRICT. AND I GOT TO REPRESENT HIM BRIEFLY UNTIL HE MOVED OUT OF MY DISTRICT TO LOOK LIKE WHEN HE WAS THERE ARE YOU HAVING TO LOOK THAT'S RIGHT. IN THE HOUSE. OF PALM SPRINGS. SO THE QUESTION IS FIRST QUESTIONS YOU THE OPPORTUNITY YOU KNOW TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE UNDERLYING PURPOSE OF THIS MEASURE I CERTAINLY. UNFORTUNATELY NOT MARKSON REMARKS PASSED AWAY- GREAT GREAT PERSON WHEN I BECAME CHAIR OF THE YOUTH COMMISSION THE SEVENTIES HE WAS THE ONLY ONE TO WRITE ME A LETTER OF CONGRATULATIONS AND I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT. SO BIG DEAL IN THOSE DAYS. BUT GIVE ME A CHANCE TARTUS ASSEMBLY REUSS ABOUT THIS BILL TO GET SOME UNDERSTANDING WHAT HIS INTENT WAS I NEVER DID FOLLOW UP WITH HIM. I ALWAYS BELIEVE THAT THE INTENTION WAS TO PROVIDE TOOLS SO THAT THE LOCAL MUNICIPAL AGENCIES CAN BETTER BE ABLE TO SERVE. AND PROVIDE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA IF BASED UPON OFFERING THIS AUTHORITY TO RATE REDUCTION BOND SOUNDS GOOD. MY ASSEMBLY MEMBER. AND FRIEND BUT DO WE KNOW ANY DATA SET AS TO WHAT WE THINK THE RATES ARE OR IS FOR THE ELECTRICAL UTILITIES PROBABLY DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. GERMANY ESTIMATES- IT WHAT YOU THINK IT MIGHT SAVE THEM IF WE WERE TO GOING TO THE MARKETS NOW. APPLYING YOUR LAW ANY IDEA ON THE OBVIOUSLY IT'S AN ISSUE OF- SCALE OF ECONOMY. SO THE BIGGER THE PROJECT- MORE SAVINGS IT IS BUT FROM EVERYTHING I UNDERSTAND. AND THERE ARE PART OF THE REASON WHY I STARTED WORKING ON THIS ABOUT. MY FIRST TERM OF OFFICE. WAS TO HELP WITH THE UNDERGROUND WATER CLEAN UP. SINCE WE NEVER REALLY GOT THE FEDERAL FUNDING THAT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO FROM BACK IN THE EIGHTIES RIGHT SO ONE OF THE WAYS OF DOING IT WAS FOR LA CITY TO FIGURE OUT THROUGH ITS MUNICIPAL. THROUGH THE W. P. HOW CAN WE- BETTER FIGHT HOW CAN WE EVEN REALIZE WHATEVER- TOOLS WE HAVE IN OUR ARSENAL. TO GET THE BEST RATE. TO FINANCE LONG TERM CLEANUP EFFORTS AND THESE CLEAN UP EFFORTS GIVEN THE BROMIDE GIVEN EVERYTHING THAT'S CONTAMINATING OUR EXISTING UNDERGROUND WATER. CAN TAKE UP. POTENTIALLY UP TO SEVENTY YEARS- SO WE WERE- THE ALLEY AQUIFER BY THE WAY IS THE SECOND LARGEST NATURALLY EXISTING AQUIFER THAT WE HAVE IN THE COUNTRY SO IT'S QUITE A BIT OF A DEPTH AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE QUITE A BIT OF. WORK TO CLEAN UP SO WITH THERE WERE THREE SITES THAT WE WERE GOING TO BE THAT DWP WAS LOOKING AT DEVELOPING. AND SO BASED ON THAT WE WERE WE STARTED WORKING ON THIS BILL WITH THE W. P. TO ENSURE THAT THEY GET THE BEST RATE POSSIBLE AND FROM MY UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THIS WOULD WORK IS. IF WE ESTABLISH A G. P. THAT HAS NO LIABILITIES THEN WE'RE GONNA BE GETTING THE BEST RATE REDUCED RATE HENCE RATE REDUCTION- TO BE ABLE TO FINANCE THESE MAJOR CAPITAL PROJECTS AND TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION SPECIFICALLY. FOR LED W. PEACE THREE PROJECTS WE'RE LOOKING AT A SAVINGS OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS. SIGNIFICANT FOREIGN MONEY PAIRS IS IT A HORRIBLE STATEMENT I REALLY GIVE A LOT OF REGARD FOR YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS AND I'VE WATCHED OVER THE YEARS IS REALLY HORRIBLE STATEMENT THAT HERE WE HAD THIS INCREDIBLE AQUIFER THAT FORM THE FOUNDATION OF THE WATER SYSTEM UNDER- MISTER MULHOLLAND WAY BACK WHEN WE'VE POLLUTED SO BADLY THAT IT IMPEDES OUR ABILITY TO- TO BASICALLY USE THAT GROUNDWATER AND REDUCE THE DEMAND ON AGRICULTURAL AREAS OF THE STATE THE NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE. THE COLORADO RIVER IN A LIKE IT REALLY IS HORRIBLE SO WHAT I WANT TO TELL YOU SIR. IS DESPITE ME TRYING TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF OUR TIME TO RUN MY FRIEND THROUGH THE GAUNTLET. I APPLAUD YOU WITH GREAT VIGOR FOR DOING THIS. I THINK IT'S A BRILLIANT IDEA AT EVERY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT SAVES MONEY IT'S TELOGEN AT EVERY LEVEL. AND I WOULD BE HONORED TO IN ADDITION TO MOVE IT. I'D LIKE TO BE A CO AUTHOR OF THIS MEASURE IF YOU WOULD SO ACCOMMODATE ME BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO JOIN YOU IN THIS MARCH. IT WOULD GREATLY HONOR ME AND I KNEW I NEEDED NEEDED TO BE VERY PREPARED. TO ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE BEING OF BECOMING. ESPECIALLY FROM MY ESTEEMED FORMER SPEAKER. FROM WHERE I GET TO REPRESENT NOW.
