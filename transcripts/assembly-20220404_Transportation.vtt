00:55:55.151 --> 00:55:56.820
HAVE THAT'S WHY I OPPOSE OUR

HAVE TO GO GET THIS CLEARED OUT

00:56:12.135 --> 00:56:14.370
IN THE FIRST PLACE AND- ALSO. I

00:56:14.437 --> 00:56:15.872
THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING IS

00:56:15.939 --> 00:56:17.240
REALLY TRYING TO EASE THOSE

01:36:13.534 --> 01:36:15.336
BOILS DOWN TO- THIS IS NOT AS

01:36:15.402 --> 01:36:17.138
DANGEROUS IN A PARKING LOT AS IT

01:36:17.204 --> 01:36:19.874
IS ON A FREEWAY- AND I GUESS I

01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:21.108
WOULD RESPECTFULLY SAY TO THAT-

01:36:21.175 --> 01:36:22.243
THERE'S NO DATA. THERE'S NO

01:36:22.309 --> 01:36:23.944
RESEARCH THERE'S NO EVIDENCE

01:36:24.011 --> 01:36:25.513
THAT THEY SITE FOR THAT

01:36:25.579 --> 01:36:26.981
PROPOSITION. I THINK COMMON TYPE

01:36:27.047 --> 01:36:28.682
SENSE TELLS ME THE OPPOSITE.

01:36:28.749 --> 01:36:29.450
THERE ARE PEDESTRIANS ON

01:36:29.517 --> 01:36:31.051
FREEWAYS- BUT THEY'RE OFTEN

01:36:31.118 --> 01:36:32.987
PEDESTRIANS AND PARKING LOTS

01:36:33.053 --> 01:36:34.021
THIS IS WHERE PEOPLE GO TO

01:36:34.088 --> 01:36:35.856

TEACH THEIR KIDS TO RIDE A BIKE

01:36:37.591 --> 01:36:39.059
SO. IN MY MIND THE DANGER IS

01:36:39.126 --> 01:36:40.828
ACTUALLY INCREASE THE CHANCES

01:36:40.895 --> 01:36:41.362
THAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE AN

01:36:41.428 --> 01:36:43.297
INNOCENT LIFE YOU LOST. IS

01:36:43.364 --> 01:36:44.265
ACTUALLY INCREASED IN A FEW

01:36:44.331 --> 01:36:45.399

NEED FOR THE POLICY MORE

01:36:48.435 --> 01:36:49.837
BROADLY. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT

01:36:49.904 --> 01:36:51.672
WOULD ALIGN THE LAW- I THINK

01:36:51.739 --> 01:36:53.774
CLARITY CONSISTENCY IN THE LAW

01:36:53.841 --> 01:36:55.709

THERE'S NOT PROBABLY ONE BILL

01:57:46.559 --> 01:57:48.027
THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE SOME KIND

01:57:48.094 --> 01:57:50.129

THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE HAVE

FOR YOUTH- AND OUR YOUNG ADULTS

01:58:19.525 --> 01:58:21.194
TO. BE ABLE TO GET AROUND US

01:58:21.260 --> 01:58:22.929
JUST ONE LESS- BURDEN ON ON A

VERY- EXPENSIVE- WAY OF LIFE

THAT WE HAVE MANY OF OUR CITIES

01:58:27.467 --> 01:58:29.101
AND THAT WE'VE SEEN THIS OPERATE

01:58:29.168 --> 01:58:30.937
VERY WELL- AND AS A CONCEPT AS

01:58:31.003 --> 01:58:31.971
SOMETHING MOVE PUSHING FOR

01:58:32.038 --> 01:58:34.474
LOCALLY- I DO HAVE A QUESTION

01:58:34.540 --> 01:58:35.441
FOR THE OPPOSITION'S THE

01:58:35.508 --> 01:58:36.442
FUNDAMENTAL THAT I DON'T

01:58:36.509 --> 01:58:38.578
UNDERSTAND ONE TALK ABOUT. LOST

01:58:38.644 --> 01:58:40.847
REVENUE AND THAT IS- IF- YOU

01:58:40.913 --> 01:58:42.415
FIRST OF ALL I RECOGNIZE THAT

01:58:42.482 --> 01:58:43.883
YOU KNOW THE PROVISION OF THIS

01:58:43.950 --> 01:58:44.951
WILL PROBABLY WORK REALLY

01:58:45.017 --> 01:58:45.952
CLOSELY AND APPROPRIATIONS AND

01:58:46.018 --> 01:58:50.356
OTHER SPACES- TO REALLY TRY TO

01:58:50.423 --> 01:58:52.558
FIND THE- STATE- C. OBLIGATION-

01:58:52.625 --> 01:58:54.193
THAT THAT SHOULD BE ABLE TO.

01:58:54.260 --> 01:58:55.795
SUPPORT ALL THIS OF COURSE ALL

01:58:55.862 --> 01:58:57.597
THAT WILL FLOW THROUGH TO OUR

01:58:57.663 --> 01:58:58.197
TRANSIT AGENCIES. TO TRY TO

01:58:58.264 --> 01:59:01.100
MAKE- YOU HOLE FOR THAT BUT IF

01:59:01.167 --> 01:59:01.601
THIS INDUCES ADDITIONAL

01:59:01.667 --> 01:59:02.635
RIDERSHIP. WRITERS THAT

01:59:02.702 --> 01:59:04.203
OTHERWISE WOULD NOT BE ON THAT.

01:59:04.270 --> 01:59:06.606
SYSTEM AN OTHERWISE NOT PAYING A

01:59:06.672 --> 01:59:08.608
FARE. BUT WE HAVE EMPTY SEATS

01:59:08.674 --> 01:59:10.209
THAT ARE DRIVING AROUND THE

01:59:10.276 --> 01:59:12.078
DISTRICT HOW IS IT FROM I GUESS

01:59:12.144 --> 01:59:13.880
A MARGINAL. COST PERSPECTIVE

01:59:13.946 --> 01:59:16.282
THAT THAT YOU WOULD WE COUNT

01:59:16.349 --> 01:59:17.850
THAT AS REDUCED REVENUE. SO

01:59:17.917 --> 01:59:19.418
LITTLE REDUCED REVENUES REVENUE

01:59:19.485 --> 01:59:21.521
THAT'S LOSS OF THE FIREBOX. AND

01:59:21.587 --> 01:59:24.423
SO IN THE STATE WE COLLECT ABOUT

01:59:24.490 --> 01:59:25.458
ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS

01:59:25.525 --> 01:59:27.960
ANNUALLY. IN REVENUES FROM THE

01:59:28.027 --> 01:59:29.662
FAREBOX NOW STIPULATE THAT THAT

01:59:29.729 --> 01:59:32.298
DOES SPEAK TO THE POPULATION AS

01:59:32.365 --> 01:59:33.065
A WHOLE. AT THE SPECIFIC

01:59:33.132 --> 01:59:34.767
DEMOGRAPHIC THAT'S EXPECTED

01:59:34.834 --> 01:59:36.936
WITHIN THIS BILL. INTO AGENCIES

01:59:37.003 --> 01:59:38.404
WOULD IN THE NEAR TERM BECAUSE

01:59:38.471 --> 01:59:39.405
THE BILL'S PROVISION THAT

01:59:39.472 --> 01:59:41.107
STRUCTURE IS THAT AGENCIES AFTER

01:59:41.173 --> 01:59:43.843
FOREGO. REVENUES AS A MEANS OF

01:59:43.910 --> 01:59:45.111
SUPPORTING THEIR SYSTEMS. LOSE

01:59:45.177 --> 01:59:46.412
OUT DIRECTLY ON THOSE

01:59:46.479 --> 01:59:49.148
INVESTMENTS. BUT IN ADDITION TO

01:59:49.215 --> 01:59:50.716
THAT THE AREA WHERE WE'VE BEEN

01:59:50.783 --> 01:59:52.451
CONCERNED AND THAT SPOKEN TO

01:59:52.518 --> 01:59:54.387
WITHIN OUR LETTER. IS THAT

01:59:54.453 --> 01:59:55.555
CONCEPT OF INDUCED DEMAND. NOW

01:59:55.621 --> 01:59:57.523
GRANTED ARE AT TIMES INSTANCES

01:59:57.590 --> 01:59:58.991
OF VEHICLES THAT ARE RUNNING

01:59:59.058 --> 02:00:00.426
EMPTY OR RUNNING WITH LESS THAN

02:00:00.493 --> 02:00:02.528
FULL CAPACITY. IN THOSE CASES

02:00:02.595 --> 02:00:04.597
YOU HAVE CAPACITY THAT CAN BE

02:00:04.664 --> 02:00:05.798
FILLED. BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT

02:00:05.865 --> 02:00:07.700
THERE IS INDUCED DEMAND IN NEW

02:00:07.767 --> 02:00:08.901
AREAS AND THERE ARE GOING TO

02:00:08.968 --> 02:00:10.436
REQUIRE ADDITIONAL SERVICE. THAT

02:00:10.503 --> 02:00:11.571
MEANS NEW VEHICLES THAT MEANS

02:00:11.637 --> 02:00:13.306
NEW OPERATORS ALL THAT COMES

02:00:13.372 --> 02:00:14.740
WITH SOME ADDITIONAL COSTS OTHER

02:00:14.807 --> 02:00:16.976
THAN BORN BY THE AGENCY. I KNOW

02:00:17.043 --> 02:00:18.244
THAT IS FURTHER COMPOUNDED AS A

02:00:18.311 --> 02:00:20.179
CONCERN WHEN YOU TAKE INTO

02:00:20.246 --> 02:00:21.180
ACCOUNT THE REALITY THAT RIGHT

02:00:21.247 --> 02:00:23.149
NOW. EVERY AGENCY IN THE STATE

02:00:23.215 --> 02:00:25.017
IS FACING AN OPERATOR SHORTAGE.

02:00:25.084 --> 02:00:25.918
AND SO IF YOU'VE MADE A

02:00:25.985 --> 02:00:27.486
COMMITMENT FOR AGENCIES TO

02:00:27.553 --> 02:00:29.155
PROVIDE THE SERVICE BUT THEY

02:00:29.221 --> 02:00:30.489
CAN'T FILL THAT COMMITMENT THAT

02:00:30.556 --> 02:00:32.124
ALSO DOES CREATE SOME CHALLENGES

02:00:32.191 --> 02:00:34.126
FROM AN OPERATIONAL PERSPECTIVE.

02:00:34.193 --> 02:00:35.895
OR BY AGENCIES MAY HAVE TO BE

02:00:35.962 --> 02:00:37.196
PASSING UP CUSTOMERS BECAUSE

02:00:37.263 --> 02:00:38.564
DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES THE

02:00:38.631 --> 02:00:40.299
FINANCIAL OR HUMAN RESOURCES

02:00:40.366 --> 02:00:41.300
NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THE

02:00:41.367 --> 02:00:42.935
SERVICE. AND SO IT'S ACROSS THE

02:00:43.002 --> 02:00:45.237
SPECTRUM THAT WE HAVE CONCERNED.

02:00:45.304 --> 02:00:46.172
ON THAT OF COURSE WE ARE.

02:00:46.238 --> 02:00:47.306
INTERESTED IN WORKING WITH THE

02:00:47.373 --> 02:00:48.741
AUTHOR TO EXPLORE FURTHER HOW

02:00:48.808 --> 02:00:50.176
THIS CAN BE ADDRESSED- BUT

02:00:50.242 --> 02:00:51.510
THAT'S CHIEFLY WHERE CONCERNS

02:00:51.577 --> 02:00:53.613
LIE OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT IT IS

02:00:53.679 --> 02:00:55.982
MY HOPE THAT YOU KNOW IF WE ARE

02:00:56.048 --> 02:00:57.550
ESPECIALLY A YOUNGER AGE- REALLY

02:00:57.617 --> 02:00:58.751
ENCOURAGING. INDIVIDUALS USE

02:00:58.818 --> 02:01:01.187
TRANSIT. THROUGH A PROGRAM LIKE

02:01:01.253 --> 02:01:02.855
THIS WHERE WE ARE FUNDING THAT-

02:01:02.922 --> 02:01:04.924
WITH ANY ANY INDUCED DEMAND THAT

02:01:04.991 --> 02:01:07.159
IS THERE- WOULD OPTIMIZE A

02:01:07.226 --> 02:01:08.861
SYSTEM THAT'S ALREADY RUNNING- I

02:01:08.928 --> 02:01:10.997
THINK IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS TO

02:01:11.063 --> 02:01:12.064
SEE. WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE

02:01:12.131 --> 02:01:13.933
EXCEEDED CAPACITY AND WE NEED TO

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:14.867
THINK ABOUT ADDITIONAL

02:01:14.934 --> 02:01:19.372
OPERATIONAL BUT. I DON'T FEEL

02:01:19.438 --> 02:01:21.040
LIKE WHERE THEY'RE CLOSE TO

02:01:21.107 --> 02:01:22.408
THEIR AT- WE ALREADY SAID- RIGHT

02:01:22.475 --> 02:01:23.843
FOR. A LOT OF OUR- AND THE

02:01:23.909 --> 02:01:26.612
SYSTEMS AS IT IS I SEE THIS IS.

02:01:26.679 --> 02:01:27.780
SOMETHING THAT WILL BE ABLE TO

02:01:27.847 --> 02:01:28.914
PROVIDE BETTER UTILIZATION. OF

02:01:28.981 --> 02:01:29.448
THAT SYSTEM AND HOPEFULLY

02:01:29.515 --> 02:01:30.816
REALLY- SPUR. INTEREST BY THAT

02:01:30.883 --> 02:01:33.052
GENERATION FOR THE REST OF THEIR

02:01:33.119 --> 02:01:35.087
ADULTHOOD AS WELL SO THANK YOU

02:01:35.154 --> 02:01:36.489
FOR THE BILL HAPPY TO MOVE IT

02:01:36.555 --> 02:01:38.190
AND I KNOW YOU'LL CONTINUE TO

02:01:38.257 --> 02:01:39.425
WORK ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES.

02:01:39.492 --> 02:01:43.029
ANYONE ELSE. WOULD YOU LIKE TO

02:01:43.095 --> 02:01:47.333
CLOSE. YES MILITARY FIRST OF ALL

02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:49.468
WHAT WE WERE SORT OF A EXCITED

02:01:49.535 --> 02:01:50.136
AT THE BEGINNING WHEN WE STARTED

02:01:50.202 --> 02:01:52.204
THIS MEETING BY ENTHUSIASTICALLY

02:01:52.271 --> 02:01:54.073
JOINED IN WITH THIS COMMITTEE

02:01:54.140 --> 02:01:55.574
AND ITS RECOMMENDATION ON THE

02:01:55.641 --> 02:01:57.376
AMENDMENTS AND THAT ESSENTIALLY

02:01:57.443 --> 02:01:59.345
WHAT I'VE HEARD IN THE

02:01:59.412 --> 02:02:01.080
PRESENTATION FOR THE OPPOSITION.

02:02:01.147 --> 02:02:03.182
WAS NOT RECOGNIZING APPRECIATING

02:02:03.249 --> 02:02:05.384
THAT THIS BILL IS NOT. MANDATING

02:02:05.451 --> 02:02:08.988
OR OR- PENALIZING A BASED ON THE

02:02:09.055 --> 02:02:10.690
RECOMMENDATION OF THE CHAIR AND

02:02:10.756 --> 02:02:13.926
STAFF- ANY PROVIDER OR AGENCY

02:02:13.993 --> 02:02:15.995
THAT'S NOT CURRENTLY APPROVED-

02:02:16.062 --> 02:02:18.898
OF PROVIDING A TRANSIT PROGRAM

02:02:18.964 --> 02:02:20.466
THAT THEY NOW MUST CHOOSE

02:02:20.533 --> 02:02:22.201
BETWEEN HOW THEY ALLOCATE THOSE

02:02:22.268 --> 02:02:23.269
RESOURCES SO I THINK WE

02:02:23.335 --> 02:02:26.505
ADDRESSED. ALREADY THAT CONCERN

02:02:26.572 --> 02:02:28.774
AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

02:02:28.841 --> 02:02:30.409
TO NOTE THAT THERE WAS ALSO

02:02:30.476 --> 02:02:32.845
REFERENCING AND THE- AMENDMENTS

02:02:32.912 --> 02:02:34.980
AROUND AND M. O. USE OF THOSE I

02:02:35.047 --> 02:02:36.582
THINK IT WAS MENTIONED BY THE-

02:02:36.649 --> 02:02:38.651
THE OPPOSITION ON THE PHONE LINE

02:02:38.718 --> 02:02:39.485
THAT WHY WOULD YOU GIVE THE

02:02:39.552 --> 02:02:42.722
MONEY TO. ME WHY NO ONE WOULD

02:02:42.788 --> 02:02:43.355
WANT TO PARTICIPATE OR OR PUT

02:02:43.422 --> 02:02:44.924
THEIR OWN RESOURCES AND IF THE

02:02:44.990 --> 02:02:47.693
STATE IS GOING TO GIVE THE MONEY

02:02:47.760 --> 02:02:48.928
WELL THAT'S WITH THEM OR YOU IS

02:02:48.994 --> 02:02:49.929
DESIGNED TO ADDRESS. THAT IF YOU

02:02:49.995 --> 02:02:52.331
ARE CURRENTLY FOUND RESOURCES TO

02:02:52.398 --> 02:02:54.767
SUPPORT A STUDENT TRANSIT. PASS

02:02:54.834 --> 02:02:57.369
PROGRAM LIKE THIS THE ANY

02:02:57.436 --> 02:02:59.271
ADDITIONAL MONIES FROM THE STATE

02:02:59.338 --> 02:03:01.207
THROUGH THIS PROGRAM WOULD BE TO

02:03:01.273 --> 02:03:03.743
AUGMENT NOT SUPPLANT. AND THAT'S

02:03:03.809 --> 02:03:06.512
WHAT MY UNDERSTANDING AND SO TO

02:03:06.579 --> 02:03:07.780
THAT END I THINK THAT THE

02:03:07.847 --> 02:03:09.648
QUESTIONS AT LEAST THAT WERE

02:03:09.715 --> 02:03:11.150

OTHER ELEMENTS THAT MIGHT BE A

02:03:16.722 --> 02:03:19.225
CONCERN THAT ARE THE REAL- BUT I

02:03:19.291 --> 02:03:20.960
THINK THE REAL SUBSTANTIVE ONCE

02:03:21.026 --> 02:03:22.161
A- BY VIRTUE THE COMMITTEE HAS.

02:03:22.228 --> 02:03:23.062

MEAN I AGAIN IT GOES WITHOUT

02:03:27.099 --> 02:03:28.567
SAYING WHETHER YOU REPRESENT A

02:03:28.634 --> 02:03:29.301

SCALE FOR THAT SHOULD BE- SO

02:07:48.794 --> 02:07:50.662

WHAT IF YOU'LL COULD BE

02:10:03.061 --> 02:10:04.163

ACCESS TO GAS STATIONS. IS

02:10:11.069 --> 02:10:11.703
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. LOBAL

02:10:11.770 --> 02:10:13.105
FEELING IS THE GREENEST WAY TO

02:10:13.172 --> 02:10:15.073
DELIVER FUEL BECAUSE IT REDUCES

02:10:15.140 --> 02:10:16.975
BILL AT SPILLAGE ARE YOU SICK

02:10:17.042 --> 02:10:18.310
USING SPECIALLY TRAINED

EMPLOYEES WHO AVOID COMMON

02:10:19.912 --> 02:10:21.813
FUELING MISTAKES. IT REDUCES

02:10:21.880 --> 02:10:23.448
VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AND

02:10:23.515 --> 02:10:25.117
EMISSIONS BY BEING ABLE TO FEEL

02:10:25.184 --> 02:10:26.385
MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED VEHICLES

02:10:26.451 --> 02:10:29.154
WITH JUST ONE TANKER. THEREBY

02:10:29.221 --> 02:10:29.821
ELIMINATING HUNDREDS OF TRIPS TO

02:10:29.888 --> 02:10:31.623
THE GAS STATION. AND IT REDUCES

02:10:31.690 --> 02:10:33.125
RELIANCE ON UNDERGROUND STORAGE

02:10:33.192 --> 02:10:35.661
TANKS AT GAS STATIONS WHICH

OFTEN WE CAN TO OUR GROUND.

02:10:36.929 --> 02:10:38.430
GLOBAL ENERGY DELIVERY IS ALSO

02:10:38.497 --> 02:10:40.199
KEY TO ACCELERATING ADOPTION OF

02:10:40.265 --> 02:10:41.466
ALTERNATIVE FUELS BECAUSE IT

02:10:41.533 --> 02:10:42.601
DOES NOT REQUIRE THE

02:10:42.668 --> 02:10:44.570
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT. LIKE

02:10:44.636 --> 02:10:46.338
BRICK AND MORTAR STATIONS. FOR

02:10:46.405 --> 02:10:48.574
EXAMPLE LESS THAN 2% OF GAS

02:10:48.640 --> 02:10:49.708
STATIONS CURRENTLY OFFER

02:10:49.775 --> 02:10:51.643
RENEWABLE DIESEL. BUT BOOSTER

02:10:51.710 --> 02:10:53.178
BEGAN OFFERING RENEWABLE DIESEL

02:10:53.245 --> 02:10:54.479
JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO AND

02:10:54.546 --> 02:10:57.349
ALREADY WE HAVE CONVERTED 95% OF

02:10:57.416 --> 02:10:58.283
OUR DIESEL CLIENTS TO RENEWABLE

02:10:58.350 --> 02:11:00.686
DIESEL. THE SAME PROMISE EXISTS

02:11:00.752 --> 02:11:03.222
WITH OTHER ALTERNATIVE FUELS

02:11:03.288 --> 02:11:04.323
SUCH AS HYDROGEN AND EASY

02:11:04.389 --> 02:11:07.559
CHARGING. UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO

02:11:07.626 --> 02:11:09.328
OUTDATED RULES MORE THAN HALF OF

02:11:09.394 --> 02:11:10.762
THE THIRTY FIVE AIR DISTRICTS

02:11:10.829 --> 02:11:11.897
AND CALIFORNIA BAR MOBILE

02:11:11.964 --> 02:11:14.533
FEELING. THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS

02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:15.367
NECESSARY. THE BILL WOULD

02:11:15.434 --> 02:11:17.169
REQUIRE AIR DISTRICTS TO ENACT

02:11:17.236 --> 02:11:18.136
RULES FOR MOBILE FEELING IN A

02:11:18.203 --> 02:11:19.705
MANNER THAT ENSURE THE

02:11:19.771 --> 02:11:20.505
PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT IN

02:11:20.572 --> 02:11:22.541
THREE KEY WAYS. NUMBER ONE ONLY

02:11:22.608 --> 02:11:24.276
CARPET CERTIFIED MOBILE FEELERS

02:11:24.343 --> 02:11:27.112
WOULD BE ALLOWED TO OPERATE. TO

02:11:27.179 --> 02:11:28.380
EACH DISTRICT WOULD BE ABLE TO

02:11:28.447 --> 02:11:29.548
ESTABLISH THEIR OWN THROUGHPUT

02:11:29.615 --> 02:11:31.016
LIMITS SENSITIVE RECEPTORS

02:11:31.083 --> 02:11:33.118
STANDARDS. AND OTHER MEASURES TO

02:11:33.185 --> 02:11:34.453
ADDRESS DISTRICT SPECIFIC

02:11:34.519 --> 02:11:36.822
ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS. AND

02:11:36.888 --> 02:11:38.257
THREE AS DR QUICK MENTIONED THAT

02:11:38.323 --> 02:11:40.392
THERE IS A SEGMENT OF THE MOBILE

02:11:40.459 --> 02:11:41.059
FUELING INDUSTRY THAT HAS BEEN

DOES HAVE ACCESS TO THIS BUT

02:23:59.330 --> 02:24:00.965
WHAT IS HAPPENING THE OTHER

02:24:01.032 --> 02:24:02.700
TWENTY PERCENT. THE ANSWER IS

02:24:02.767 --> 02:24:06.270
IT'S UNREGULATED. FELLOW IF

02:24:06.337 --> 02:24:08.106
THURSDAY ARE EXEMPTION FOR

02:24:08.172 --> 02:24:10.575
SMALLER. VEHICLE DELIVERIES WHAT

02:24:10.641 --> 02:24:12.443
IS IT HOW MANY GALLONS. A

02:24:12.510 --> 02:24:14.879
RANGERS FROM USUALLY ONE TWENTY

02:24:14.946 --> 02:24:16.447
TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY GALLONS

02:24:16.514 --> 02:24:19.317
YEAH SO IF YOU'RE- IN A- PICKUP

02:24:19.384 --> 02:24:20.251
TRUCK AND YOU HAVE TWO HUNDRED

02:24:20.318 --> 02:24:22.053

02:24:26.758 --> 02:24:28.693
THIS COULD THIS IS DANGEROUS. ON

02:24:28.760 --> 02:24:30.294
THE OTHER HAND BOOSTER FUELS IS

02:24:30.361 --> 02:24:32.130
ALLOWED TO OPERATE BOTH IN THE

02:24:32.196 --> 02:24:34.832
BAY AREA. AND IN THE SOUTH COAST

02:24:34.899 --> 02:24:35.933
AND THE REASON THEY'RE WHO

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:37.635
HELPED OPERATE IS THEY DON'T

02:24:37.702 --> 02:24:40.038
HAVE THIS PROBLEM. THE SMALLER

02:24:40.104 --> 02:24:42.273
OPERATORS DO AND YET THEY'RE

02:24:42.340 --> 02:24:45.176
ALLOWED TO OPERATE AND BOOSTER

02:24:45.243 --> 02:24:48.546
FUELS IS NOT SO I THINK WE HAVE

02:24:48.613 --> 02:24:49.480

02:25:06.531 --> 02:25:09.634
OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS ARE

02:25:09.700 --> 02:25:10.635

02:26:40.124 --> 02:26:41.425
TOGETHER AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

02:26:41.492 --> 02:26:43.561
AND SO ON THAT POINT IN TERMS

02:26:43.628 --> 02:26:45.897
OF. RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I AGREE

02:26:45.963 --> 02:26:47.798
WITH UNREGULATED PART OF IT LIKE

02:26:47.865 --> 02:26:48.966
RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE UNREGULATED

02:26:49.033 --> 02:26:50.067
PICKUP TRUCKS RUNNING AROUND IS

02:26:50.134 --> 02:26:53.838
FILLING UP. THAT'S NOT TENABLE-

02:26:53.905 --> 02:26:55.973
AND OF THE OTHER ASPECT OF IT

02:26:56.040 --> 02:26:57.208
BECAUSE I'VE SEEN THIS HAPPEN IN

02:26:57.275 --> 02:26:59.510
MY OWN COMMUNITY WHICH IS A GOOD

02:26:59.577 --> 02:27:01.045
THING AS I'VE SEEN A COUPLE GAS

02:27:01.112 --> 02:27:02.480
STATIONS CLOSE- I THINK WE

02:27:02.547 --> 02:27:04.215
NEEDED. THAT WOULD BE GREAT IF

02:27:04.282 --> 02:27:05.983
WE SEE MORE OF THOSE HAPPEN OF

02:27:06.050 --> 02:27:08.819
COURSE AS YOU KNOW THE GAS

02:27:08.886 --> 02:27:10.054
STATIONS IN THEMSELVES- TAKEN

02:27:10.121 --> 02:27:11.422
NORMA'S AMOUNT OF RESOURCES TO

02:27:11.489 --> 02:27:12.990
CLEAN UP ONCE THEY CLOSE OR WHAT

02:27:13.057 --> 02:27:15.793
HAVE YOU. AND WHEN I WAS IN THE

02:27:15.860 --> 02:27:17.228
CITY COUNCIL WE HAD OUR FIRST.

02:27:17.295 --> 02:27:19.931
HYDROGEN STATION I THINK IT'S

02:27:19.997 --> 02:27:21.032
ALMOST TEN YEARS I THINK WE

02:27:21.098 --> 02:27:22.867
STILL ONLY HAVE THAT ONE.

02:27:22.934 --> 02:27:23.868
BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY

02:27:23.935 --> 02:27:25.002
EXPENSIVE- AND SO I'M VERY

02:27:25.069 --> 02:27:26.204
INTRIGUED BY THE- FUTURE

02:27:26.270 --> 02:27:28.673
APPLICATIONS CERTAINLY OF MOBILE

02:27:28.739 --> 02:27:31.809
HYDROGEN. WHICH I THINK IS

02:27:31.876 --> 02:27:33.744
REALLY THE KIND OF THE GOLDEN

02:27:33.811 --> 02:27:34.946
TICKET SO TO SPEAK OF THIS KIND

02:27:35.012 --> 02:27:36.214
OF TECHNOLOGY WHERE YOU CAN

02:27:36.280 --> 02:27:40.351
REALLY- EXPAND. UPON THIS IS A

02:27:40.418 --> 02:27:41.953
RENEWABLE TECHNOLOGY BASICALLY

02:27:42.019 --> 02:27:44.222
GREEN HYDROGEN OF COURSE- TO GET

02:27:44.288 --> 02:27:47.658
OUT INTO THE COMMUNITIES- AND DO

02:27:47.725 --> 02:27:49.260
YOU BUT I GUESS THE QUESTION A

02:27:49.327 --> 02:27:52.697
DOCTOR CORK IS- ARE THAT. YOU

02:27:52.763 --> 02:27:54.165
YOU MENTIONED TRYING TO WORK

02:27:54.232 --> 02:27:56.834
WITH OF CAPITAL AND WHAT HAVE

02:27:56.901 --> 02:27:58.803
YOU- ARE THERE. THE OTHER AREAS

02:27:58.869 --> 02:28:01.205
YOU THINK- IS THERE A MIDDLE

02:28:01.272 --> 02:28:03.007
GROUND THAT YOU CAN GET TO YOU

02:28:03.074 --> 02:28:05.409
BELIEVE IN THIS REGARD- I DO

02:28:05.476 --> 02:28:08.279
BELIEVE THAT- KEPCO MAY NOT BUT

02:28:08.346 --> 02:28:10.514
LOOK I'M WILLING TO SAY EACH

02:28:10.581 --> 02:28:11.916
DISTRICT WILL SET ITS OWN

02:28:11.983 --> 02:28:16.454
STANDARDS BUT IT CAN'T ALLOW.

02:28:16.520 --> 02:28:17.622
THESE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY

02:28:17.688 --> 02:28:20.324
GALLON. OUR PEOPLE POLLUTING THE

02:28:20.391 --> 02:28:23.127
AIR AT THE SAME TIME NOT ALLOW

02:28:23.194 --> 02:28:26.130
MOBILE FUELING WHICH HAS ALL THE

02:28:26.197 --> 02:28:27.598
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION IN THIS

02:28:27.665 --> 02:28:29.333
TO ME IS A REAL CONTRADICTION

02:28:29.400 --> 02:28:31.669
AND IT EXISTS IN THE 20% OF THE

02:28:31.736 --> 02:28:34.939
STATE THAT'S NOT ALLOWING. SO I

02:28:35.006 --> 02:28:37.508
WANT TO WORK WITH THEM. TO WORK

02:28:37.575 --> 02:28:39.910
ON TIME LINES WE CAN WORK ON

02:28:39.977 --> 02:28:41.946
WHAT THE STANDARD IS- BUT WE CAN

02:28:42.013 --> 02:28:44.148
GO FROM THERE IS THE MOBILE.

02:28:44.215 --> 02:28:45.349
PUMPING IS AS THE SUMMER WORE

02:28:45.416 --> 02:28:47.118
INDICATING LIKE GOING OUT TO

02:28:47.184 --> 02:28:48.486
COMMUNITIES AND PUMPING WHETHER

02:28:48.552 --> 02:28:50.288
IT'S FLEAS OR OTHERWISE DOES

02:28:50.354 --> 02:28:52.857
THAT. POSE A SIMILAR PROBLEM TO

02:28:52.923 --> 02:28:54.392
KNOW TO FOLKS THAT ARE POPPING

02:28:54.458 --> 02:28:56.827
UP AT THE GAS STATION OR IS

02:28:56.894 --> 02:28:57.395
THERE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN

02:28:57.461 --> 02:28:59.130
THOSE KINDS OF THAT CONDUCT WELL

02:28:59.196 --> 02:29:02.099
WHY DON'T YOU- I'LL HAVE MY

02:29:02.166 --> 02:29:04.268
EXPERTISE. A SERVICE OF ASSEMBLY

02:29:04.335 --> 02:29:06.103
MEMBER KALRA THANK YOU FOR THE

02:29:06.170 --> 02:29:07.138
QUESTION YOU KNOW AS WITH ANY

02:29:07.204 --> 02:29:11.008
INDUSTRY THAT IS NEW- THERE ARE-

02:29:11.075 --> 02:29:12.176
THIS IS IN THE EARLY STAGE OF

02:29:12.243 --> 02:29:13.778
POLICY DEVELOPMENTS- RIGHT NOW.

02:29:13.844 --> 02:29:15.079
AND THERE'S BASICALLY TWO BROAD

02:29:15.146 --> 02:29:16.847
CATEGORIES OF REGULATION ONE IS

02:29:16.914 --> 02:29:17.748
FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL SIDE

02:29:17.815 --> 02:29:19.550
WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE HERE

02:29:19.617 --> 02:29:20.618
DISCUSSING. ONE IS FROM. THE

02:29:20.685 --> 02:29:22.553
FIRE SAFETY SIDE ON THE FIRE

02:29:22.620 --> 02:29:25.489
SAFETY SIDE- A NEWS SECTION OF

02:29:25.556 --> 02:29:27.391
THE CALIFORNIA FIRE CODE. STOP

02:29:27.458 --> 02:29:28.793
ME FROM GOING TO THE BUT IT'S A

02:29:28.859 --> 02:29:30.294
START WITH THE INTERNATIONAL

02:29:30.361 --> 02:29:31.562
FIRE CODE WHICH THE CALIFORNIA

02:29:31.629 --> 02:29:32.463
STATE FOLLOWS IN THE CALIFORNIA

02:29:32.530 --> 02:29:35.333
FIRE CODE. THE ADOPTED SECTION

02:29:35.399 --> 02:29:36.100
FIFTY SEVEN OH SEVEN IN TWENTY

02:29:36.167 --> 02:29:38.903
EIGHTEEN. WHICH LIMITS THE USAGE

02:29:38.969 --> 02:29:40.004
OF MOBILE FEELING AND TO THAT

02:29:40.071 --> 02:29:41.672
QUICK POINT. THE REASON THAT

02:29:41.739 --> 02:29:43.074
THIS BILL IS ALWAYS HAD THE

02:29:43.140 --> 02:29:44.241
SUPPORT OF THE CALIFORNIA FIRE

02:29:44.308 --> 02:29:45.509
CHIEFS IS BECAUSE THE PICKUP

02:29:45.576 --> 02:29:46.977
TRUCK SIDE OF THE INDUSTRY AS

02:29:47.044 --> 02:29:48.045
WE'RE CALLING IT. HAS BEEN

02:29:48.112 --> 02:29:49.814
OPERATING AND COMPLETE FLAGRANT

02:29:49.880 --> 02:29:51.215
VIOLATION OF FIRE COLD ALL

02:29:51.282 --> 02:29:53.317
THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. INCLUDING

02:29:53.384 --> 02:29:54.218
ON RESIDENTIAL STREET WHICH IS

02:29:54.285 --> 02:29:56.253
PROHIBITED. SO RIGHT NOW THE

02:29:56.320 --> 02:30:00.224
BASIC REQUIREMENTS FROM A FIRE

02:30:00.291 --> 02:30:01.926
CODE PERSPECTIVE ARE A CITY IN

02:30:01.992 --> 02:30:03.794
AND OF ITSELF MAY DECIDE THAT IT

02:30:03.861 --> 02:30:05.296
DOESN'T WANT TO ADOPTED IN THE

02:30:05.363 --> 02:30:06.263
FIRE CODE. OPERATE SO THERE ARE

02:30:06.330 --> 02:30:08.566
CITIES IN CALIFORNIA WHICH HAD

02:30:08.632 --> 02:30:09.233
MAY BE INDEPENDENT OF SUCH AND

02:30:09.300 --> 02:30:10.134
WE JUST DON'T WANT MOBILE

02:30:10.201 --> 02:30:12.002
FEELING SO CITIES DO HAVE THAT

02:30:12.069 --> 02:30:13.871
POWER. B. ARE YOU MUST BE TEN

02:30:13.938 --> 02:30:15.272
FEET AWAY FROM ANY BUILDING YOU

02:30:15.339 --> 02:30:17.108
CANNOT FUEL ON PUBLIC STREETS.

02:30:17.174 --> 02:30:18.976
AND YOU MUST BE TEN FEET AWAY

02:30:19.043 --> 02:30:21.345
FROM ANY OF PROPERTY LINE SO. TO

02:30:21.412 --> 02:30:22.480
ASSEMBLY MEMBER WARDS CONCERN

02:30:22.546 --> 02:30:23.881
WHICH WELL I DO UNDERSTAND I

02:30:23.948 --> 02:30:27.218
HEAR TO HEAR THAT A LOT- THEY-

02:30:27.284 --> 02:30:31.155
THE FIRE. CODE GEN- ALLEN'S

02:30:31.222 --> 02:30:32.857
HABIT THAT WE COME UP WITH A

02:30:32.923 --> 02:30:34.125
SYSTEM THAT HAVE TRIED TO REDUCE

02:30:34.191 --> 02:30:36.060
ANY SORT OF REST BY MAKING SURE

02:30:36.127 --> 02:30:38.262
THAT THERE'S NEVER GOING TO BE A

02:30:38.329 --> 02:30:39.630
MOBILE FEWER. ON THE STREET

02:30:39.697 --> 02:30:40.264
WHILE IT'S CONDUCTING FUELING.

02:30:40.331 --> 02:30:42.066
BUT TO THE SAFETY POINT. THE

02:30:42.133 --> 02:30:43.768
PROCESS THAT MOLECULAR LIKE

02:30:43.834 --> 02:30:45.669
BOOSTER HAVE GONE THROUGH IT

02:30:45.736 --> 02:30:46.270
TOOK THREE YEARS OF ENGAGING

02:30:46.337 --> 02:30:48.406
WITH CARB. TO HAVE OUR TANKERS

02:30:48.472 --> 02:30:50.341
DOT TESTED PRESSURE TESTED

CRASH PROOF. THEY SET A ROUTE

02:30:54.011 --> 02:30:55.913
WHERE ADS AGAIN ON THE OTHER

02:30:55.980 --> 02:30:57.148
SIDE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

ANYWHERE FROM A HUNDRED TO TWO

02:30:59.150 --> 02:31:00.384
HUNDRED FIFTY GALLONS OF

02:31:00.451 --> 02:31:01.886
GASOLINE AND DIFFERENT

02:31:01.952 --> 02:31:02.887
CONTAINERS THAT DO NOT HAVE THE

02:31:02.953 --> 02:31:04.088
LEVEL OF PROTECTIONS. AND THAT'S

02:31:04.155 --> 02:31:05.356
WHERE THE TRUTH THROUGH THE TRUE

02:31:05.423 --> 02:31:06.924
DANGER LIES BUT IN TERMS OF

02:31:06.991 --> 02:31:09.059
WHERE WE CAN OPERATE IT IS TEN

02:31:09.126 --> 02:31:11.595
TIMES THE B. AND COMMERCIAL- OR

02:31:11.662 --> 02:31:13.397
INDUSTRIAL AREAS NOT YET IN

RESIDENTIAL AREAS DUE TO THOSE

02:31:15.499 --> 02:31:18.035
LIMITATIONS- UNDER THE FIRE

HOW MANY OF THEM ARE THE

02:31:35.085 --> 02:31:36.754
DIFFERENTLY ABLED POPULATION

02:31:36.821 --> 02:31:38.656

FOR THEM SURE SO. THE ANSWER IS

02:31:44.995 --> 02:31:45.996
DIFFERENT IN CALIFORNIA THAN IN

02:47:39.983 --> 02:47:41.384
SAFETY HAS A- VERY DIFFICULT

02:47:41.451 --> 02:47:42.585
SITUATION BECAUSE SHARING OF

02:47:42.652 --> 02:47:44.387
INFORMATION. IS CRITICAL TO

02:47:44.454 --> 02:47:45.889
ENSURING THAT WE'RE CONNECTING

02:47:45.955 --> 02:47:47.757
THE DOTS. AND TRYING TO PREVENT.

02:47:47.824 --> 02:47:50.160
A BAD THINGS ARE HAPPENING- I AM

02:47:50.226 --> 02:47:51.995
COMING IN FROM A DIFFERENT

02:47:52.061 --> 02:47:53.897
PERSPECTIVE THAT BIFURCATING- IN

02:47:53.963 --> 02:47:55.598
CERTAIN STATES. THAT YOU CAN

02:47:55.665 --> 02:47:56.933
TALK TO IN CERTAIN STATES YOU

02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:58.601
CAN'T TALK TO. AND AGENCIES CAN

02:47:58.668 --> 02:48:00.036
TALK TO AGES YOU CAN'T TALK TO

02:48:00.103 --> 02:48:01.938
YOU. ABOUT THAT IS IT IT'S

02:48:02.005 --> 02:48:03.873
PROBLEMATIC TO ME BECAUSE- THE

02:48:03.940 --> 02:48:06.643
IN THE DAY. WE NEED TO BE

02:48:06.709 --> 02:48:08.411
LOOKING AT TRYING TO PREVENT-

02:48:08.478 --> 02:48:10.380
YOU KNOW HEINOUS ACTS ARE

02:48:10.447 --> 02:48:12.649
HAPPENING POTENTIALLY AND

02:48:12.715 --> 02:48:14.050
ENSURING THAT THERE IS FREE

02:48:14.117 --> 02:48:16.786
FLOWING INFORMATION- IS CRITICAL

02:48:16.853 --> 02:48:18.955
SO FOR THAT REASON I'M GONNA LAY

02:48:19.022 --> 02:48:21.491

02:48:21.558 --> 02:48:22.592

MEMBERS I I'D STILL HAVE SOME

02:48:32.035 --> 02:48:34.504
CONCERNS REGARDING- THE SHARING

02:48:34.571 --> 02:48:36.940
OF THE DATA PARTICULARLY. WITH

02:48:37.006 --> 02:48:39.909
OTHER STATES- AND IF I MAY BE

02:48:39.976 --> 02:48:41.244
THE OPPOSITE APPROACH FOR THE

02:48:41.311 --> 02:48:44.347
OPPOSITE ANGLE AS OUR CALL THE

02:48:44.414 --> 02:48:48.318

02:48:48.384 --> 02:48:52.355
MAYBE AM LAY OFF TODAY BUT I DO-

02:48:52.422 --> 02:48:53.323
BUT LOOK FORWARD TO THE

02:48:53.389 --> 02:48:56.493
CONTINUED WORK ON THIS- WHEN AB

02:48:56.559 --> 02:48:57.994
YOU KNOW IF IT GOES TO PRIVACY

02:48:58.061 --> 02:49:01.798
AND COMES TO THE FLOOR- BUT- YOU

02:49:01.865 --> 02:49:03.800
KNOW HIS AS A FOR A PUBLIC

02:49:03.867 --> 02:49:06.202
DEFENDER I HAVE A LOT OF

02:49:06.269 --> 02:49:08.238
CONCERNS WHEN DATA STARTS TO

02:49:08.304 --> 02:49:10.773
MOVE QUICKLY ACROSS STATE LINES-

02:49:10.840 --> 02:49:12.542
WHEN- WELL YOU KNOW I THINK WE

02:49:12.609 --> 02:49:14.511
GENERALLY HAVE MORE RESPECT FOR

02:49:14.577 --> 02:49:17.614
THE PRIVACY OF. OF THOSE THAT

02:49:17.680 --> 02:49:19.349
GET CAUGHT UP IN OUR CRIMINAL

02:49:19.415 --> 02:49:21.951
JUSTICE SYSTEM AND I ALSO HAVE A

02:49:22.018 --> 02:49:25.822
VERY- KIND OF- I GUESS IF HE OF

02:49:25.889 --> 02:49:27.223
THE MY NOT CRITICALLY WELL RIGHT

02:49:27.290 --> 02:49:29.893
NOW UP SENSE OF PLACES PLACE

02:49:29.959 --> 02:49:31.728
READERS IN GENERAL WHAT HAPPENS

02:49:31.794 --> 02:49:33.763
WITH THAT DATA. AND SO- WITH THE

02:49:33.830 --> 02:49:35.031
BENEFIT OF TIME BY THE

02:49:35.098 --> 02:49:36.366
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK SOME MORE

02:49:36.432 --> 02:49:37.267
AND HOPEFULLY HAVE THE

02:49:37.333 --> 02:49:39.469
OPPORTUNITY TO GET ON BOARD AS

02:49:39.536 --> 02:49:40.870
PARTICULARLY WITH CONTINUE TO

02:49:40.937 --> 02:49:43.673
WORK WITH SOME OF THE- THE

02:49:43.740 --> 02:49:44.307
OPPOSITION ON THE PRIVACY SIDE

02:49:44.374 --> 02:49:46.643
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I DON'T

02:49:46.709 --> 02:49:47.810
SEE ANYONE ELSE PUBLIC MY

02:49:47.877 --> 02:49:49.946
COMMENTS- I THINK THIS IS KIND

02:49:50.013 --> 02:49:51.080
OF A TOUGH BILL- TOUGH BUT

02:49:51.147 --> 02:49:52.715
IMPORTANT I DO THINK THAT

02:49:52.782 --> 02:49:54.450
THERE'S A PUBLIC SAFETY BENEFIT

02:49:54.517 --> 02:49:55.418
TO SHARING THIS INFORMATION AND

02:49:55.485 --> 02:49:57.320
IF THERE WAS SOMEONE WHO WAS A

02:49:57.387 --> 02:49:58.988
FUGITIVE WHO IS DANGEROUS WHO

02:49:59.055 --> 02:50:00.957
HAD COMMITTED A HEINOUS CRIME OF

02:50:01.024 --> 02:50:02.392
COURSE I WOULD WANT LAW

02:50:02.458 --> 02:50:03.393
ENFORCEMENT TO BE ABLE TO USE

02:50:03.459 --> 02:50:05.061
ALL THE RESOURCES THAT THEY HAD

02:50:05.128 --> 02:50:06.529
AVAILABLE WITHIN THE LAW AND TO

02:50:06.596 --> 02:50:07.897
MAKE SURE THAT WE COULD SHARE

02:50:07.964 --> 02:50:09.332
INFORMATION WITH OUR PARTNERS IN

02:50:09.399 --> 02:50:11.200
OTHER STATES I DO THINK THAT

02:50:11.267 --> 02:50:12.468
THERE ARE TIMES WHEN PUBLIC

02:50:12.535 --> 02:50:13.236
SAFETY WOULD BE. YOU KNOW WOULD

02:50:13.303 --> 02:50:14.904
REALLY HANG IN THE BALANCE ON

02:50:14.971 --> 02:50:16.139
THE OTHER HAND IT' REALLY A

02:50:16.205 --> 02:50:17.874
SHAME THAT THERE ARE STATES OUT

02:50:17.941 --> 02:50:19.342
THERE THAT ARE PUTTING BOUNTIES

02:50:19.409 --> 02:50:21.711
OUT ON WOMEN WHO ARE JUST

02:50:21.778 --> 02:50:23.746
SEEKING TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL

02:50:23.813 --> 02:50:25.248
THE TIMING OF WHEN THEY ARE TO

02:50:25.315 --> 02:50:27.417
HAVE OR NOT HAVE A CHILD OR OR

02:50:27.483 --> 02:50:28.952
CARRY A CHILD THAT THERE ARE

02:50:29.018 --> 02:50:31.554
STATES THAT ARE- CRIMINALIZING

02:50:31.621 --> 02:50:33.056
OF PARENTS AND DOCTORS WHO WANT

02:50:33.122 --> 02:50:34.190
TO HELP THEIR CHILDREN WITH

02:50:34.257 --> 02:50:35.992
GENDER AFFIRMING SURGERY IT'S

02:50:36.059 --> 02:50:38.328
ACTUALLY THIS BILL SHOWS THAT

02:50:38.394 --> 02:50:39.862
THOSE VERY ACTIONS ON ONLY DO

02:50:39.929 --> 02:50:41.364
THEY ENDANGER THE SAFETY AND

02:50:41.431 --> 02:50:43.333
HEALTH AND THE WELL BEING OF

02:50:43.399 --> 02:50:44.500
THOSE INDIVIDUALS. BUT THEY PUT

02:50:44.567 --> 02:50:47.236
ALL OF OUR SAFETY AT RISK

02:50:47.303 --> 02:50:49.372
BECAUSE OF EXACTLY THIS KIND OF

02:50:49.439 --> 02:50:51.574
TREPIDATION TO SHARE INFORMATION

02:50:51.641 --> 02:50:53.309
WITH STATES WHO ARE

02:50:53.376 --> 02:50:57.146
FUNDAMENTALLY- THREATENING AND-

02:50:57.213 --> 02:50:59.315
CURTAILING THE CIVIL RIGHTS OF

02:50:59.382 --> 02:51:01.117
THEIR CITIZENS AND CRIMINALIZING

02:51:01.184 --> 02:51:03.286
PEOPLE ACTING WITHIN THEIR OWN

02:51:03.353 --> 02:51:06.122
CIVIL RIGHTS SO- THAT'S WHY THIS

02:51:06.189 --> 02:51:07.790
IS DIFFICULT AND I THINK UP

02:51:07.857 --> 02:51:10.326
SETTING FOR A LOT OF US- AND- I

02:51:10.393 --> 02:51:12.261

SERIOUSLY AS YOU HAVE AND

02:51:15.031 --> 02:51:16.299
WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE ON

02:51:16.366 --> 02:51:17.367
AMENDMENTS TO TRY TO ADDRESS

02:51:17.433 --> 02:51:18.935
THAT. I'M GONNA VOTE FOR THE

02:51:19.002 --> 02:51:20.436
BILL TODAY BECAUSE IT IS GOING

02:51:20.503 --> 02:51:21.804
TO THE PRIVACY COMMITTEE WHERE

02:51:21.871 --> 02:51:23.840
I'M HOPING THEY CAN CONTINUE TO

02:51:23.906 --> 02:51:26.075
REFINE THIS BILL SO THAT THOSE

02:51:26.142 --> 02:51:28.111
STATES DON'T USE THIS AS A WAY

02:51:28.177 --> 02:51:31.180
OF HUNTING DOWN- YOU KNOW

02:51:31.247 --> 02:51:32.715
VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS AS THEY

02:51:32.782 --> 02:51:34.851
SEEM INTENT ON DOING A BUT AT

02:51:34.917 --> 02:51:36.819
THE SAME TIME ALLOWING US TO

02:51:36.886 --> 02:51:38.021
SHARE INFORMATION TO KEEP THE

02:51:38.087 --> 02:51:39.889
PUBLIC SAFE. SO WITH THAT CAN WE

02:52:09.085 --> 02:52:10.887
