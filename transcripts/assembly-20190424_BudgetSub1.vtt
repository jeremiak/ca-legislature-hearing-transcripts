00:36:39.096 --> 00:36:40.498
MAKE THEM SHORTER.

00:36:40.565 --> 00:36:43.067
SO THE TOOL IS DEVELOPED AROUND

00:36:43.134 --> 00:36:44.969
THE REGULATORY STRUCTURE --

00:36:45.036 --> 00:36:48.339
DIFFERENT FROM HOW THE KIT WAS

00:36:48.406 --> 00:36:49.507

HELP THE FACILITY IT GOES AROUND

00:36:55.313 --> 00:36:56.714
IT'S BUILT ON DOMAINS LIKE

00:36:56.781 --> 00:36:58.683
PHYSICAL PLANT MEDICATIONS

00:36:58.749 --> 00:37:00.618

FOCUSED ON ALL OF THOSE AREAS

00:37:04.388 --> 00:37:06.290
AND IT'S ALSO GOT THE ABILITY

00:37:06.357 --> 00:37:07.792
FOR CONTINUALLY UPDATED THAT

00:37:07.858 --> 00:37:09.193
WHEN THERE'S NEW LEGISLATION WE

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:10.661
UPDATE IT SO IT'S RIGHT THERE IN

00:37:10.728 --> 00:37:11.729
THE TOOL WE DON'T HAVE A

00:37:11.796 --> 00:37:13.965
STANDARD COM -- COMPREHENSIVE

00:37:14.031 --> 00:37:15.833
TOOL FOR OUR PROGRAM SO IT'S ALL

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:17.335
THE TRAINING IN THEIR HEADS THAT

00:37:17.401 --> 00:37:17.902
THEY THINK THEY'VE GOT TO GO

00:37:17.969 --> 00:37:19.770
AROUND AND AND CHECK MOST OF

00:37:19.837 --> 00:37:21.305
THAT NOW WE HAVE A STANDARD.

00:37:21.372 --> 00:37:22.840
ANOTHER BENEFIT IS THAT WILL BE

00:37:22.907 --> 00:37:25.076
ABLE TO HAVE A BASELINE OF DATA

00:37:25.142 --> 00:37:26.877
WE USE OUR DATA TO SEE WHERE WE

00:37:26.944 --> 00:37:28.546
IDENTIFY CHALLENGES IN IN

00:37:28.613 --> 00:37:31.282
CHILDCARE OR ADULT SENIOR KERR --

TRAINING IN THOSE AREAS WHERE

00:37:34.585 --> 00:37:35.119
WE'RE SEEING THEY'RE HAVING

00:37:35.186 --> 00:37:37.421
PROBLEMS WE'VE HAD SYMPOSIUMS TO

00:37:37.488 --> 00:37:38.289
TRAIN.

00:37:38.356 --> 00:37:40.024
EVEN THE STAFF IN THE FACILITIES

00:37:40.091 --> 00:37:41.525
AS WELL AS OUR OWN STAFF LIKE

00:37:41.592 --> 00:37:43.461
FOR INSTANCE PRESSURE ULCERS

00:37:43.527 --> 00:37:43.995
THEY'VE HAD.

00:37:44.061 --> 00:37:46.163
YOU KNOW AT A LARGE INCREASE IN

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:47.498
PRESSURE ULCERS IN OUR ADULT

00:37:47.565 --> 00:37:48.933
SENIOR CARE FACILITIES IN THAT

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.201
THAT THEY'RE NOT CLINICIANS SO

00:37:50.267 --> 00:37:52.003
WE'RE TRAINING THEM ON HOW.

00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:53.638
TO PREVENT THEM AND HOW TO YOU

00:37:53.704 --> 00:37:54.438
KNOW WHEN THEY CHANGE

00:37:54.505 --> 00:37:56.140
MEDICATIONS WITH AN ADULT HOW

00:37:56.207 --> 00:37:57.375
THEY INTERACT TOGETHER THEY

00:37:57.441 --> 00:37:58.309
MIGHT LOOK FOR THINGS LIKE

00:37:58.376 --> 00:37:59.410
SLEEPING MORE.

00:37:59.477 --> 00:38:00.945
MOVING THEM AROUND GIVING THEM

00:38:01.012 --> 00:38:02.480
ACTIVE SO I MEAN THERE'S THINGS

00:38:02.546 --> 00:38:04.348
THAT WE TRAIN OUR LPH TO TRAIN

00:38:04.415 --> 00:38:06.283
THEM FOR BEST PRACTICES CHILD

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:08.719
CARE WE DID -- CHALLENGING BEING

00:38:08.786 --> 00:38:09.754
CHILDREN WITH CHALLENGING

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:11.555
BEHAVIORS HOW TO DEAL WITH THAT

00:38:11.622 --> 00:38:12.823
WE TRAINED YOU KNOW BOTH THE

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:17.094
CARE GIVERS AS WELL AS OUR OWN

00:38:17.161 --> 00:38:18.362
STAFF.

00:38:18.429 --> 00:38:18.729
AND THAT'S ALL.

00:38:18.796 --> 00:38:19.330
PART OF THIS NEW TOOL IS TO

00:38:19.397 --> 00:38:20.231
PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION WHEN

00:38:20.297 --> 00:38:21.565
THEY GO OUT AND DO AN INSPECTION

00:38:21.632 --> 00:38:22.667
TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT

00:38:22.733 --> 00:38:24.001
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WHILE

00:38:24.068 --> 00:38:25.436
THEY'RE OUT AT THE FACILITY

00:38:25.503 --> 00:38:27.571
INSTEAD OF DECIDING THEM AND AND

00:38:27.638 --> 00:38:28.572
AND WHAT WE WERE DOING IN THE

00:38:28.639 --> 00:38:29.240
PAST.

00:38:29.306 --> 00:38:30.941
USING ARMED FORCE MEANT.

00:38:31.008 --> 00:38:32.176
AND THEN WE WERE JUST SHUTTING

00:38:32.243 --> 00:38:34.078
THEM DOWN SO WE WERE SEEING IT

00:38:34.145 --> 00:38:34.979
WASN'T DOING ANY GOOD WE HAVE A

00:38:35.046 --> 00:38:36.313
SHORTAGE OF BEDS IN THE STATE

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:38.082
AND SO THAT THAT IS THAT WAS THE

00:38:38.149 --> 00:38:39.884
IMPETUS FOR THE NEW TOOLS WE

00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:40.885
WERE SEEN WE WERE IN THERE DOING

00:38:40.951 --> 00:38:44.021
pLATER THEY'RE HAVING PROBLEMS

00:38:44.088 --> 00:38:47.291
THAT WERE NOT IDENTIFIED WHEN WE

00:38:47.358 --> 00:38:52.129
WERE IN THERE PRIOR WITH THE KIT --

00:38:52.196 --> 00:38:53.731
AND THEN SOME OF THE IMPEDIMENTS

00:38:53.798 --> 00:38:55.266
IT'S CERTAINLY THE TOOL TOOK

00:38:55.332 --> 00:38:57.435
LONGER IN THE PILOT BUT IT'S A

00:38:57.501 --> 00:38:59.070
IT'S A COMPREHENSIVE TOOL AS

00:38:59.136 --> 00:39:00.838
OPPOSED TO THE KIT WHICH IS AS A

00:39:00.905 --> 00:39:02.206
SHORT ABBREVIATED TOOL.

00:39:02.273 --> 00:39:03.674
SO FROM THAT COMPREHENSIVE TOOL

00:39:03.741 --> 00:39:04.675
WE'RE GOING TO DEVELOP THE

00:39:04.742 --> 00:39:05.810
STANDARD TOLL WHICH WILL BE A

00:39:05.876 --> 00:39:07.845
MUCH SHORTER ONE SO THE TOLL IT

00:39:07.912 --> 00:39:09.980
TOOK A LONG TIME SO THAT THAT

00:39:10.047 --> 00:39:11.449
WAS ONE OF THE DRAWBACKS.

00:39:11.515 --> 00:39:13.084
BUT WE'VE ALREADY.

00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:14.885
WE'VE BEEN MEETING WITH THAT

00:39:14.952 --> 00:39:16.721
THEY AND LICENSED LICENSEES AS

00:39:16.787 --> 00:39:20.057
WELL AS THE L. P. A.'S.

00:39:20.124 --> 00:39:21.392
AND GOT SOME OF THEIR FEEDBACK

00:39:21.459 --> 00:39:22.526
FROM THE TOOL SO WE'VE ALREADY

00:39:22.593 --> 00:39:24.228
REDUCE THE REGULATIONS ON THAT

00:39:24.295 --> 00:39:26.597
TOLL FROM FIFTEEN HUNDRED TO

00:39:26.664 --> 00:39:27.231
FIVE HUNDRED BASED ON THE SCOPE

00:39:27.298 --> 00:39:28.899
AND SEVERITY OF ALL OF OF THE

00:39:28.966 --> 00:39:30.034
REGULATIONS WHAT'S THE

00:39:30.101 --> 00:39:31.969
LIKELIHOOD OF THAT.

00:39:32.036 --> 00:39:34.805
THAT FINDING TO OCCUR LOOKING AT

00:39:34.872 --> 00:39:36.373
PASSED STATUS SO WE'VE ALREADY

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:38.242
REDUCED IT DOWN SO WE THINK IT'S

00:39:38.309 --> 00:39:40.911
GOING TO BE MUCH SHORTER -- AND

00:39:40.978 --> 00:39:42.713
THEN THERE'S ALSO THE IMPEDIMENT

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:46.183
OF THE IMPLEMENTATION YOU KNOW

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:48.052
THERE'S LIMóN LIMITATIONS.

00:39:48.119 --> 00:39:49.754
WITH OUR LEGACY SYSTEMS WERE

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:52.189
LOOKING TOWARDS GETTING ON A NEW --

00:39:52.256 --> 00:39:54.191
I. T. SYSTEM BUT OUR OUR SYSTEMS

00:39:54.258 --> 00:39:56.427
ARE VERY SLOW -- SO BUILDING

00:39:56.494 --> 00:39:57.361
THAT INTO THAT SYSTEM THAT'S

00:39:57.428 --> 00:39:58.896
GONNA BE A LITTLE BIT OF A

00:39:58.963 --> 00:40:01.432
LIMITATION BUT WE'RE STILL YOU

00:40:01.499 --> 00:40:02.466
KNOW GOING TO GO FORWARD WITH

00:40:02.533 --> 00:40:04.769
THAT -- WORKING AROUND THOSE

00:40:04.835 --> 00:40:08.405
CHALLENGES.

00:40:08.472 --> 00:40:10.441
SO THE NEXT QUESTION WHAT ARE

00:40:10.508 --> 00:40:11.742
THE AREAS OF CONTINUING

00:40:11.809 --> 00:40:13.277
IMPROVEMENT IN THE COMPLAINT

00:40:13.344 --> 00:40:14.445
PROCESSES.

00:40:14.512 --> 00:40:15.980
WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THE

00:40:16.046 --> 00:40:17.281
COMPLAINTS WE'VE HAD A BACKLOG

00:40:17.348 --> 00:40:19.083
YOU KNOW FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:20.885
AND WE RECEIVE THIRTEEN

00:40:20.951 --> 00:40:22.153
POSITIONS.

00:40:22.219 --> 00:40:24.255
AND TWENTY FIFTEEN LIMITED TERM

00:40:24.321 --> 00:40:26.957
POSITIONS AND WERE ASKING FOR AN

00:40:27.024 --> 00:40:28.726
EXTENSION OF FUNDING FOR ANOTHER

00:40:28.793 --> 00:40:29.860
TWO YEARS FOR THOSE LIMITED TERM

00:40:29.927 --> 00:40:32.062
POSITIONS WE DIVIDED THOSE THAT

00:40:32.129 --> 00:40:33.564
BETWEEN ADULTS SENIOR CARE AND

00:40:33.631 --> 00:40:35.099
AND CHILDREN'S RESIDENTIAL

00:40:35.166 --> 00:40:36.734
BECAUSE ACTUALLY THOSE.

00:40:36.801 --> 00:40:38.402
THE RESIDENTIAL INSPECTIONS TAKE

00:40:38.469 --> 00:40:39.737
MUCH LONGER THAN THE CHILD CARE

00:40:39.804 --> 00:40:43.040
FACILITIES -- AND SO WE DIVIDED

00:40:43.107 --> 00:40:44.742
THEM UP TO CONTINUE AT WE HAVE

00:40:44.809 --> 00:40:47.077
REDUCE THE BACKLOG CONTINUALLY

00:40:47.144 --> 00:40:48.546
OVER THE YEARS.

00:40:48.612 --> 00:40:50.447
HOWEVER THE COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN

00:40:50.514 --> 00:40:52.817
INCREASING -- OVER THE PAST FIVE

00:40:52.883 --> 00:40:54.952
YEARS SO WE'VE BEEN KEEPING UP

00:40:55.019 --> 00:40:56.520
WITH THE INCREASE COMPLAINTS AND

00:40:56.587 --> 00:40:58.055
JUST WHITTLING AWAY AT THE

00:40:58.122 --> 00:40:58.989
BACKLOG.

00:40:59.056 --> 00:41:02.426
AND AS WELL AS KEEPING UP WITH

00:41:02.493 --> 00:41:04.028
OUR INSPECTIONS.

00:41:04.094 --> 00:41:05.362
WE'VE ALSO DIVIDE -- DEVELOP THE

00:41:05.429 --> 00:41:07.364
STATE WIDE TRIAGE PROCESS SO

00:41:07.431 --> 00:41:08.999
WHEN THE COMPLAINTS COME IN WE

00:41:09.066 --> 00:41:11.068
HAVE PEACE OFFICER INVESTIGATORS

00:41:11.135 --> 00:41:12.369
THAT WORK FOR US A SMALL CADRE

00:41:12.436 --> 00:41:14.171
OF PEACE OFFICERS SO THEY DO OUR

00:41:14.238 --> 00:41:17.208
PRIORITY ONES WITH CHURCH SEXUAL

00:41:17.274 --> 00:41:19.844
ABUSE -- IT FOR ONE EXAMPLE AND

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:21.078
SO WE'VE DEVELOPED A TRIAGE

00:41:21.145 --> 00:41:23.080
PROCESS SO IT'S EASY AND QUICK

00:41:23.147 --> 00:41:24.248
AND IT'S A STANDARD ACROSS THE

00:41:24.315 --> 00:41:25.216
STATE THAT.

00:41:25.282 --> 00:41:27.184
THE COMPLAINT -- TRIAGE AND THEN

00:41:27.251 --> 00:41:28.652
THEY'RE SENT EITHER TO THE THE

00:41:28.719 --> 00:41:30.287
PEACE OFFICERS OR THEIR SENT

00:41:30.354 --> 00:41:31.789
TOWARD L. P. A.'S.

00:41:31.856 --> 00:41:33.824
THE MOST OF THEM GO OUT OF OUR

00:41:33.891 --> 00:41:35.426
LPA IS THAT ARE THE THE NORMAL

00:41:35.492 --> 00:41:36.694
ANALYSTS THAT DO THE INSPECTIONS

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.295
BUT IT'S MUCH FASTER IT'S MORE

00:41:38.362 --> 00:41:40.631
EFFICIENT -- THE INVESTIGATORS

00:41:40.698 --> 00:41:42.199
THE PEACE OFFICERS ARE TAKING ON

00:41:42.266 --> 00:41:44.201
MORE WORK SO THAT THAT'S ONE WAY

00:41:44.268 --> 00:41:46.036
THAT WE'VE ADDRESSED -- SOME OF

00:41:46.103 --> 00:41:47.771
THE BACKLOG SO AND WE JUST

00:41:47.838 --> 00:41:49.373
CONTINUE TO JUST LOOK FOR

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:52.142
EFFICIENCIES AS FAR AS WE STILL

00:41:52.209 --> 00:41:53.844
WANT TO DO THOROUGH INSPECTIONS

00:41:53.911 --> 00:41:55.446
WE DON'T WANT TO RUSH THROUGH

00:41:55.512 --> 00:41:57.281
THESE INSPECTIONS SO OF THE

00:41:57.348 --> 00:41:59.450
PRIMARY THE BACKLOG OR PRIORITY

00:41:59.516 --> 00:42:03.153
THREE AND FORCE.

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:05.122
WHICH ARE -- THEY COULD BE COLD

00:42:05.189 --> 00:42:06.991
FOOD OR IT COULD BE -- PAPER

00:42:07.057 --> 00:42:07.925
ISSUES THEY'RE NOT HEALTH AND

00:42:07.992 --> 00:42:14.531
SAFETY ISSUES.

00:42:14.598 --> 00:42:17.501
AND SO THE LAST QUESTION IS WHAT

00:42:17.568 --> 00:42:18.836
IS THE FEEDBACK FROM DISTRICT

00:42:18.903 --> 00:42:20.170
STAFF ON THE CHANGES ACROSS THE

00:42:20.237 --> 00:42:22.273
CO.

00:42:22.339 --> 00:42:25.276
SO THAT HAS BEEN -- IT'S A IT'S

00:42:25.342 --> 00:42:26.810
A LONG CULTURE TO CHANGE THAT

00:42:26.877 --> 00:42:28.212
THAT GOING FROM STRICTLY

00:42:28.279 --> 00:42:29.980
ENFORCEMENT TO FOCUSING ON

00:42:30.047 --> 00:42:31.048
PREVENTION AND TECHNICAL

00:42:31.115 --> 00:42:32.783
ASSISTANCE TO KEEP THESE

00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:34.685
FACILITIES AND COMPLIANCE -- AND

00:42:34.752 --> 00:42:37.087
SO THEY VIEW THAT AS A POSITIVE

00:42:37.154 --> 00:42:38.489
THEY THEY LIKE HAD TAKEN THE

00:42:38.555 --> 00:42:40.357
TIME TO DO THAT AND MAKING SURE

00:42:40.424 --> 00:42:41.825
THAT THE LICENSEE UNDERSTANDS

00:42:41.892 --> 00:42:43.694
THE REGULATION THEY VIOLATED

00:42:43.761 --> 00:42:44.595
BECAUSE THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS

00:42:44.662 --> 00:42:45.362
WE FOUND.

00:42:45.429 --> 00:42:47.164
IS WHEN WE WERE CITING THEM THEY

00:42:47.231 --> 00:42:47.965
REALLY DIDN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND

00:42:48.032 --> 00:42:50.000
THE THE RED REGULATION SO PART

00:42:50.067 --> 00:42:51.101
OF THE TOOL IS.

00:42:51.168 --> 00:42:52.569
THEY NEED TO EXPLAIN TO THEM

00:42:52.636 --> 00:42:56.340
SHOW THEM THE REGULATION AND

00:42:56.407 --> 00:42:57.574
EXPLAIN TO THEM AT THAT TIME.

00:42:57.641 --> 00:42:59.310
WHERE THE VIOLATION OCCURRED SO

00:42:59.376 --> 00:43:00.077
IT'S MORE OF A ADD A ADD

00:43:00.144 --> 00:43:02.012
TRAINING AT THAT TIME AS WELL?

00:43:02.079 --> 00:43:03.647
SO THAT.

00:43:03.714 --> 00:43:05.549
PART OF THAT WAS THE POSITIVE

00:43:05.616 --> 00:43:07.885
FROM THE STUFF -- THERE'S BEEN A

00:43:07.952 --> 00:43:09.520
LOT OF CHANGES IN HOW WE WRITE

00:43:09.586 --> 00:43:10.587
UP OUR REPORTS WITH PRINCIPLES

00:43:10.654 --> 00:43:12.222
OF DOCUMENTATION THEY USED TO

00:43:12.289 --> 00:43:13.724
WRITE FREE HAND AND SO THERE WAS

00:43:13.791 --> 00:43:14.358
NO.

00:43:14.425 --> 00:43:16.627
STANDARDIZATION THE THE REPORTS

00:43:16.694 --> 00:43:18.529
ARE UP ON OUR WEBSITE WE HAVE

00:43:18.595 --> 00:43:20.764

THOUSAND HITS ON OUR WEBSITE A

00:43:21.465 --> 00:43:22.499
MONTH SO.

00:43:22.566 --> 00:43:23.467
THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME

00:43:23.534 --> 00:43:25.135
STANDARDIZATION SO THE PUBLIC

00:43:25.202 --> 00:43:27.104
UNDERSTANDS WHAT THE VIOLATION

00:43:27.171 --> 00:43:29.907
WAS AND AND HAVE A SPECIFIC

00:43:29.974 --> 00:43:32.242
FORMAT SO -- WE'VE EMBEDDED

00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:33.644
QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROCESSES

00:43:33.711 --> 00:43:34.678
THROUGHOUT.

00:43:34.745 --> 00:43:36.580
IS MUCH AS WE POSSIBLY CANCEL ON

00:43:36.647 --> 00:43:38.682
WE IMPLEMENT THESE NEW CHANGES

00:43:38.749 --> 00:43:39.850
THAT WE REALLY LOOK TO SEE IF

LOW INCOME PROGRAM THAT'S ABLE

01:04:36.005 --> 01:04:37.340

FORMALLY HOMELESS.

01:04:55.057 --> 01:04:55.625
SO THERE.

01:04:55.691 --> 01:04:56.859
THERE ARE FEW USERS THE FEW OF

OF THE LANDMARK PROGRAM

01:04:59.695 --> 01:05:01.230
UNFORTUNATELY.

01:05:01.297 --> 01:05:03.299
DESPITE ITS SUCCESS AND THE

01:05:08.104 --> 01:05:10.306
FUNDED -- AND AS A RESULT WE

01:05:10.373 --> 01:05:11.240
HAVE A WAITING LIST THAT

01:05:11.307 --> 01:05:12.875

01:15:30.959 --> 01:15:33.662
COMPONENT -- BECAUSE HE'S A LOT

01:15:33.729 --> 01:15:36.164
OF JOBS THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS

01:15:36.231 --> 01:15:37.466

01:15:37.532 --> 01:15:40.669
WITH HIGH LEVELS OF PROFICIENCY.

01:15:40.736 --> 01:15:42.337
BUT I'M I'M THINKING THAT YOU

01:15:42.404 --> 01:15:42.537
KNOW.

01:15:42.604 --> 01:15:45.807
WE CREATED A A COST.

01:15:45.874 --> 01:15:47.509
BY RELOCATING THEM WE THOUGHT WE

01:15:47.576 --> 01:15:48.644
WERE SAVING MONEY BUT IF WE WERE

01:15:48.710 --> 01:15:51.380
ABLE TO USE THIS PROGRAM ALSO

01:15:51.446 --> 01:15:51.980
BECAUSE THEY ARE LOW INCOME OR

01:15:52.047 --> 01:15:53.015
NO INCOME.

01:15:53.081 --> 01:15:54.616
THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY AGAIN

01:15:54.683 --> 01:15:55.951
THEN UTILIZE A SAVINGS FOR

01:15:56.018 --> 01:15:56.852
TRAINING.

01:15:56.919 --> 01:15:58.453
AND AND AND KIND OF CROSS HYBRID

01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:02.991
MODEL OF YOU CROSS UTILIZATION.

01:16:03.058 --> 01:16:03.592
I JUST I JUST WANT TO PUT THAT

01:16:03.659 --> 01:16:08.363
OUT THERE.

01:16:08.430 --> 01:16:09.831
MR WITH.

01:16:09.898 --> 01:16:11.934
YEAH JUST CURIOUS -- HOW DO YOU

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:12.868
DECIDE WHICH LOW INCOME

01:16:12.935 --> 01:16:16.038
COMMUNITIES YOU GO INTO?

01:16:16.104 --> 01:16:19.141
IS THAT BASED ON GREENHOUSE GONE

01:16:19.207 --> 01:16:21.610
ON THE GAC FUND AND THE ENVIRO

01:16:21.677 --> 01:16:24.046
SCAN.

01:16:24.112 --> 01:16:26.248
SO IS BASED ON THE VIRUS CAM.

01:16:26.315 --> 01:16:26.782
SO YOU DON'T GO IN ANY MY

01:16:26.848 --> 01:16:27.249
COMMUNITIES.

01:16:27.316 --> 01:16:28.250
YOU KNOW GOING TO SOME OF THE

01:16:28.317 --> 01:16:29.885
POOREST COMMUNITIES IN NORTHERN

01:16:29.952 --> 01:16:32.154
CALIFORIA BECAUSE WE DON'T

01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:32.454
[inaudible]

01:16:32.521 --> 01:16:34.089
HIT.

01:16:34.156 --> 01:16:35.791
THE BENCH MARKS ON THE VIRUS

01:16:35.857 --> 01:16:37.726
SCAN BECAUSE WE HAVE CLEAN AIR

01:16:37.793 --> 01:16:39.695
AND WE HAVE CLEAN WATER WE GOT A

01:16:39.761 --> 01:16:41.797
LOT OF POOR PEOPLE.

01:16:41.863 --> 01:16:45.167
AND THAT'S A PROBLEM FOR ME.

01:16:45.233 --> 01:16:46.735
THE HUGE PROBLEM FOR ME.

01:16:46.802 --> 01:16:47.302
SPECIFICALLY THE LOW INCOME

01:16:47.369 --> 01:16:48.570
WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM AND HOW

01:16:48.637 --> 01:16:50.539
IT'S CURRENTLY IS ADMINISTERED

01:16:50.605 --> 01:16:53.041
IT IS BASED ON THE CALAVERAS

01:16:53.108 --> 01:16:54.309
GREEN I THINK IT'S WRONG QUITE

01:16:54.376 --> 01:16:55.677
FRANKLY I GOT SOME REALLY POOR

01:16:55.744 --> 01:16:56.278
PEOPLE.

01:16:56.345 --> 01:16:58.013
IN REALLY AND AND REALLY

01:16:58.080 --> 01:16:59.715
DIFFICULT CLIMB METS AND THEY

01:16:59.781 --> 01:17:01.383
CAN'T GET ACCESS TO THIS I THINK

01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:03.218
IT'S UNFAIR WE DO HAVE THE LOW

01:17:03.285 --> 01:17:04.453
INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE

01:17:04.519 --> 01:17:06.088
PROGRAM THAT'S FEDERALLY FUNDED

01:17:06.154 --> 01:17:08.757
AS WELL AS THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:17:08.824 --> 01:17:09.624
ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.

01:17:09.691 --> 01:17:11.660
SO WE DO HAVE A LOCAL ENERGY

01:17:11.727 --> 01:17:13.228
SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT ARE

01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:16.064
AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES.

01:17:16.131 --> 01:17:17.833
JUST WITH A DIFFERENT FUND

01:17:17.899 --> 01:17:20.669
SOURCE BUT I I UNDERSTAND YOUR

01:17:20.736 --> 01:17:23.438
CONCERN.

01:17:23.505 --> 01:17:26.208
AND IF I CAN ADD -- AS A

01:17:26.274 --> 01:17:27.042
DIRECTOR STOP MENTION IN THEIR

01:17:27.109 --> 01:17:28.710
REMARKS THAT WE RECEIVED TWO

01:17:28.777 --> 01:17:30.178
HUNDRED TWO MILLION DOLLARS --

01:17:30.245 --> 01:17:32.447
FROM THE GIRAFFE A THE FUN Là

01:17:32.514 --> 01:17:33.982
WOULD SINCE -- FISCAL YEAR

01:17:34.049 --> 01:17:34.583
FOURTEEN FIFTEEN AND THE EARLY

01:17:34.649 --> 01:17:36.685
APPROPRIATIONS WERE LIMITED --

01:17:36.752 --> 01:17:38.620
TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

01:17:38.687 --> 01:17:40.188
EXCLUSIVELY HOWEVER SOME OF THE

01:17:40.255 --> 01:17:43.425
MORE RECENT -- APPROPRIATIONS

01:17:43.492 --> 01:17:44.459
DID PUT A ALLOW FOR CERTAIN A

01:17:44.526 --> 01:17:48.997
SMALL PERCENTAGE OF OF

01:17:49.064 --> 01:17:49.898
INVESTMENTS TO BE MADE OUTSIDE

01:17:49.965 --> 01:17:50.866
OF THOSE COMMUNITIES AND FOCUS

01:17:50.932 --> 01:17:53.235
MORE ON LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES.

01:17:53.301 --> 01:17:54.703
AND SO WE UNDERSTAND YOU MIGHT

01:17:54.770 --> 01:17:55.971
COMMUNITIES QUITE FRANKLY --

01:17:56.038 --> 01:17:56.872
DISADVANTAGE WHEN IT COMES TO

01:17:56.938 --> 01:17:59.041
WATER BY PROJECTS BUT WE DON'T

01:17:59.107 --> 01:18:00.709
QUALIFY FOR THE DECISION THE

01:18:00.776 --> 01:18:02.411
FUNDING THROUGH THIS PROGRAM.

01:18:02.477 --> 01:18:04.012
BASED ON THE G. G. R. F. AND I

01:18:04.079 --> 01:18:05.180
THINK THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S WHY

01:18:05.247 --> 01:18:06.648
YOU'RE HERE THAT'S ONE REASON

01:18:06.715 --> 01:18:07.816
YOU HEAR MEMBERS IN THIS.

01:18:07.883 --> 01:18:10.018
IN THIS IN THIS HOUSE TALK ABOUT

01:18:10.085 --> 01:18:11.620
THE ENVIRO SCANNED I THINK IT'S

01:18:11.686 --> 01:18:13.688
IT'S VERY UNFAIR -- TO

01:18:13.755 --> 01:18:15.290
COMMUNITIES AND RURAL RURAL

01:18:15.357 --> 01:18:16.892
AREAS THE STATE WHERE THE AIR

01:18:16.958 --> 01:18:18.093
QUALITY MIGHT BE GOOD.

01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:19.795
BECAUSE WE CAN'T CHECK ALL

01:18:19.861 --> 01:18:20.796
FOURTEEN BOXES.

01:18:20.862 --> 01:18:23.732
AND AND I I REPRESENT SOME OF

01:18:23.799 --> 01:18:25.267
THE PORTS ON THE POOREST THE THE

01:18:25.333 --> 01:18:27.669
THE LOOK AT THE MISTER AS AS

01:18:27.736 --> 01:18:28.970
MISTER MATHIS OVER THEIR NIGHT

01:18:29.037 --> 01:18:29.905
MEANT MISTER IS ANY BRING UP A

01:18:29.971 --> 01:18:31.073
GREAT POINT I THINK THAT'S

01:18:31.139 --> 01:18:32.040
DEFINITELY SOMETHING A LOT OF US

01:18:32.107 --> 01:18:33.809
AGREE ON THAT WE COULD LOOK AT

01:18:33.875 --> 01:18:34.543
AS FAR.

01:18:34.609 --> 01:18:36.845
AS LANGUAGE MOVING FORWARD YEAH

01:18:36.912 --> 01:18:38.647
I JUST THINK IT NEEDS TO BE MORE

01:18:38.713 --> 01:18:39.081
EQUITABLE I MEAN.

01:18:39.147 --> 01:18:40.315
NOT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT

01:18:40.382 --> 01:18:41.850
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES -- THE

01:18:41.917 --> 01:18:47.122
COMMISSION OF MINE AND I'LL SHOW

01:18:47.189 --> 01:18:49.891

01:18:49.958 --> 01:18:51.193
BUT IN AGAIN THERE'S BEEN SO

01:18:51.259 --> 01:18:53.495
MANY FAT FACETS OF CALAVERAS

01:18:53.562 --> 01:18:55.163
SCREEN THAT WE HAVEN'T.

01:18:55.230 --> 01:18:56.198
AND THE BAY AREA OF NOT AGREED

01:18:56.264 --> 01:18:57.232
THAT IS AN EQUITABLE KIND OF

01:18:57.299 --> 01:18:58.767
SHARING OF OF PROCESS.

01:18:58.834 --> 01:18:59.634
WE THINK THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE

01:18:59.701 --> 01:19:01.069
ANOTHER FORM OF FORMULA OR

01:19:01.136 --> 01:19:02.237
METHOD OF OF ALLOCATION.

01:19:02.304 --> 01:19:05.340
BASED ON NEEDNOT ON PERCEIVED

01:19:05.407 --> 01:19:08.577

I TRY TO GET BACK QUICKLY BUT

01:20:12.107 --> 01:20:18.980
NOT QUICK ENOUGH.

01:20:19.047 --> 01:20:26.788
I DO WANT TO DO THE L. CST --

01:20:26.855 --> 01:20:28.223

HOW YOUR ASSURING THAT THE

01:20:32.027 --> 01:20:33.261
SERVICE PROVIDERS.

01:20:33.328 --> 01:20:37.032
DO HAVE COMMUNITY EXPERIENCE.

01:20:37.098 --> 01:20:40.035
ONE THING WE ARE VERY -- AWARE

01:20:40.101 --> 01:20:41.670
OF IS THE FACT THAT WE

01:20:41.736 --> 01:20:42.637
DEFINITELY NEED TO HAVE

01:20:42.704 --> 01:20:44.172
STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT AND

01:20:44.239 --> 01:20:45.840
ENSURING THAT WERE HAVING

01:20:45.907 --> 01:20:47.342
COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT.

01:20:47.409 --> 01:20:49.077
SO WITH THE MOST RECENT REQUEST

01:20:49.144 --> 01:20:53.048
FOR PROPOSAL WE HELD --

01:20:53.114 --> 01:20:55.217
COMPREHENSIVE OF A STAKEHOLDER

01:20:55.283 --> 01:20:57.586
EVENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE

01:20:57.652 --> 01:20:59.921
WERE IN FRESNO WE GOT A REQUEST

01:20:59.988 --> 01:21:01.523
TO DO A STAKEHOLDER EVENT IN

01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:04.759
SALINAS WE WENT TO SALINAS THERE

01:21:04.826 --> 01:21:06.962
WAS AT LEAST -- I THINK FORTY

01:21:07.028 --> 01:21:08.830
DIFFERENT MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS

01:21:08.897 --> 01:21:10.065
REPRESENTED.

01:21:10.131 --> 01:21:12.434
WE DID INITIALLY A REQUEST FOR

01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:14.236
INFORMATION TO TRY TO MAKE SURE

01:21:14.302 --> 01:21:15.537
THAT WE WERE GETTING AS MUCH

01:21:15.604 --> 01:21:17.239
FEEDBACK AS WE POSSIBLY COULD AS

01:21:17.305 --> 01:21:19.474
WE LOOKED AT MAKING SURE THAT

01:21:19.541 --> 01:21:21.476
THE COMMUNITY TIES WHICH IS

01:21:21.543 --> 01:21:23.245
REALLY ESSENTIAL AND IMPORTANT.

01:21:23.311 --> 01:21:25.647
WAS BEING ACKNOWLEDGED AND SO WE

01:21:25.714 --> 01:21:27.115
TOOK THE INFORMATION BACK WE

01:21:27.182 --> 01:21:28.817
HELD WEBINARS AND RESPONDED TO

01:21:28.883 --> 01:21:30.318
THE QUESTIONS IN THE INQUIRIES

01:21:30.385 --> 01:21:31.920
THAT WE GOT FROM THE VARIOUS

01:21:31.987 --> 01:21:33.688
STAKEHOLDER ORGANIZATIONS.

01:21:33.755 --> 01:21:36.791
I'M AND WE ALSO -- WERE WERE

01:21:36.858 --> 01:21:38.326
VERY COGNIZANT ESPECIALLY THIS

01:21:38.393 --> 01:21:39.794
IS THE FIRST TIME THAT WE HAVE

01:21:39.861 --> 01:21:41.496
DONE A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL

01:21:41.563 --> 01:21:44.266
AFTER A SB EIGHTY NINE WHICH HAD

01:21:44.332 --> 01:21:46.201
A THE VERY SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

01:21:46.268 --> 01:21:47.168
OF THE DEPARTMENT.

01:21:47.235 --> 01:21:49.037
AND FOR THIS REQUEST FOR

01:21:49.104 --> 01:21:50.905
PROPOSAL BECAUSE OF THE

01:21:50.972 --> 01:21:52.207
POPULATION OF FARM WORKER

01:21:52.274 --> 01:21:54.309
HOUSING WE REALLY FELT THAT THAT

01:21:54.376 --> 01:21:56.111
WAS AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF WHAT

01:21:56.177 --> 01:21:57.979
WE WERE TARGETING AS WELL AS THE

01:21:58.046 --> 01:21:59.581
LOW INCOME IN GENERAL.

01:21:59.648 --> 01:22:01.316
AND AS WELL AS THE ENERGY

01:22:01.383 --> 01:22:03.685
EFFICIENCY EXPERIENCE SO I I

01:22:03.752 --> 01:22:05.754
THINK THAT THE OF OUR OF P. THE

01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:07.088
REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS VERY

01:22:07.155 --> 01:22:08.556
COMPREHENSIVE AND DID TAKE IN

01:22:08.623 --> 01:22:10.191
THAT FEEDBACK -- I KNOW THAT

01:22:10.258 --> 01:22:11.926
THERE ARE SOME THAT STILL ARE

01:22:11.993 --> 01:22:13.395
NOT AND WE HAVE A CONTRACTOR THE

01:22:13.461 --> 01:22:15.230
STILL IS NOT HAPPY ABOUT THE

01:22:15.297 --> 01:22:16.965
ULTIMATE OUTCOME BUT I THINK THE

01:22:17.032 --> 01:22:18.700
DEPARTMENT WAS VERY TRANSPARENT.

01:22:18.767 --> 01:22:20.902
AND AND HAD OF MULTIPLE FORMS

01:22:20.969 --> 01:22:22.637
AND AND MAYBE OTHERS -- WITH

01:22:22.704 --> 01:22:24.606
REGARD TO THOSE THAT WERE ON THE

01:22:24.673 --> 01:22:26.341
RECEIVING END OF EVERYTHING THAT

01:22:26.408 --> 01:22:27.342
THE DEPARTMENT HEAD FROM THE

01:22:27.409 --> 01:22:29.177
STAKEHOLDER PERSPECTIVE MIGHT BE

01:22:29.244 --> 01:22:30.745
BETTER TO FILL IN SOME

01:22:30.812 --> 01:22:34.249
INFORMATION IF THEY HAVEN'T LEFT.

01:22:34.316 --> 01:22:36.017
BUT I THINK I THINK -- MARCO

01:22:36.084 --> 01:22:37.419
COULD ALSO SPEAKS ABOUT IT MIGHT

01:22:37.485 --> 01:22:38.420
BE HELPFUL TO HEAR FROM SOMEBODY

01:22:38.486 --> 01:22:40.322
WHO WAS ON THE RECEIVING END OF

01:22:40.388 --> 01:22:42.190
OUR EFFORTS AROUND STAKEHOLDER

01:22:42.257 --> 01:22:43.658
ENGAGEMENT BEFORE YOU LEAVE AND

01:22:43.725 --> 01:22:45.226
I LAST MARK ON JUST A MOMENTYES

01:22:45.293 --> 01:22:45.393
IT.

01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:51.733
IS IS THERE A NEED FOR CAPACITY

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:53.068
BUILDING.

01:22:53.134 --> 01:22:56.371
SO THAT WE'RE SURE THAT WE HAVE.

01:22:56.438 --> 01:22:57.672
SO THAT THE COMMUNITY TIES ARE

01:22:57.739 --> 01:23:00.909
THERE -- WHEN WE WHEN WE DO IT?

01:23:00.975 --> 01:23:03.912
WHEN WE DO ISSUE THE CONTRACTS?

01:23:03.978 --> 01:23:04.813
ONE SPEAKS OUT RIGHT -- SO THAT

01:23:04.879 --> 01:23:06.081
THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL --

01:23:06.147 --> 01:23:09.017
INCLUDED -- REQUIREMENTS WHERE

01:23:09.084 --> 01:23:12.153
PROPOSES HAVE TO SPECIFY THEIR

01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:14.322
THE REGION'S THE REGIONAL AREAS

01:23:14.389 --> 01:23:14.889
THAT THEY WERE INTENDING TO

01:23:14.956 --> 01:23:17.292
SERVE -- SUBSTANTIATE THAT THEY

01:23:17.359 --> 01:23:19.094
HAVE A PHYSICAL PRESENCE IN

01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:21.129
THOSE AREAS AS WELL AS TO

01:23:21.196 --> 01:23:23.231
ELABORATE ON THEIR SERVICE

01:23:23.298 --> 01:23:24.599
CONNECTION TO THOSE AREAS

01:23:24.666 --> 01:23:25.600
BECAUSE THERE'S A DIFFERENCE

01:23:25.667 --> 01:23:26.568
BETWEEN BEING PHYSICALLY IN THE

01:23:26.634 --> 01:23:28.103
AREA AND THEN BEING ABLE TO

01:23:28.169 --> 01:23:29.437
SERVICE THE AREA ABSOLUTELY --

01:23:29.504 --> 01:23:32.607
SO IN IN ADDITION THE THE ART

01:23:32.674 --> 01:23:34.142
PIECE SCORED HIS SCORING RUBRIC

01:23:34.209 --> 01:23:37.178
THAT EMPHASIZE -- HIGHER POINTS

01:23:37.245 --> 01:23:39.114
TO ORGANIZATIONS THAT MET THOSE

01:23:39.180 --> 01:23:41.149
TWO KEY CRITERIA -- BUT TO

01:23:41.216 --> 01:23:42.684
SPECIFIC QUESTION ONE OF THE

01:23:42.751 --> 01:23:43.918
CHALLENGES THAT THE PROGRAM DOES

01:23:43.985 --> 01:23:45.653
FACE.

01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:49.324
IS THAT YOU KNOW THE HAVING SOME --

01:23:49.391 --> 01:23:50.959
IT THE COTTON WITH THE IN

01:23:51.025 --> 01:23:53.128
FINDING -- BECAUSE THESE PUT

01:23:53.194 --> 01:23:57.899
THESE EFFORTS THAT WE UNDERTAKE

01:23:57.966 --> 01:23:59.267
FOR EACH.

01:23:59.334 --> 01:24:00.735
PROGRAM CYCLE -- ARC WE ARE

01:24:00.802 --> 01:24:01.703
ASKING A LOT OF OUR CONTRACTORS

01:24:01.770 --> 01:24:03.671
NOT ONLY ARE WE ASKING THEM TO

01:24:03.738 --> 01:24:05.607
ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM BUT WE

01:24:05.673 --> 01:24:06.975
ALSO ARE ASKING THEM TO BE

01:24:07.041 --> 01:24:08.510
INNOVATIVE IN THE LOOK AT

01:24:08.576 --> 01:24:11.613
WRAPAROUND SERVICES OR WORKFORCE

01:24:11.679 --> 01:24:13.581
DEVELOPING UP BETWEEN THESE THAT.

01:24:13.648 --> 01:24:15.183
CAN NIGHT THAT CAN COMPLEMENT

01:24:15.250 --> 01:24:16.484
THE THE CORE OBJECTIVES OF

01:24:16.551 --> 01:24:19.387
REDUCING GHG AS WELL AS REDUCING

01:24:19.454 --> 01:24:21.656
THE ENERGY BILLS FOR LOW INCOME.

01:24:21.723 --> 01:24:24.192
AND THOSE STRATEGIES SOMETIMES A

01:24:24.259 --> 01:24:25.860
LIMITED BECAUSE THE FUNDING IS

01:24:25.927 --> 01:24:28.863
SHORT TERM OR WE CAN'T SUSTAIN

01:24:28.930 --> 01:24:30.832
THE THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT HAS

01:24:30.899 --> 01:24:32.901
BEEN ASSEMBLED AT EACH A PROGRAM

01:24:32.967 --> 01:24:33.635
CYCLE.

01:24:33.701 --> 01:24:34.235
AND SO THE THING IS WHAT YOU

01:24:34.302 --> 01:24:35.503
WERE HEARING FROM SOME OF THE

01:24:35.570 --> 01:24:36.971
MINISTRY THERE IS -- WAS THAT

01:24:37.038 --> 01:24:39.207
POINT OF ENSURING THAT THERE'S

01:24:39.274 --> 01:24:41.476
LONG TERM FINDING AND THAT WE

01:24:41.543 --> 01:24:44.579
CAN SUSTAIN SOME OF THESE

01:24:44.646 --> 01:24:46.381
EFFORTS LOCALLY.

01:24:46.448 --> 01:24:47.949
THAT IN THE GUIDANCE THAT WAS

01:24:48.016 --> 01:24:48.750
LISTED BY THE DEPARTMENT.

01:24:48.817 --> 01:24:50.618
ON COMMUNITY EXPERIENCE IT

01:24:50.685 --> 01:24:53.021
TALKED ABOUT REGIONAL.

01:24:53.087 --> 01:24:57.759
AS OPPOSED TO MORE SPECIFIC --

01:24:57.826 --> 01:25:01.729
WHY WHAT WAS WIDE THAT THAT TERM --

01:25:01.796 --> 01:25:02.931
WHY WAS THAT TERM USED SO THE

01:25:02.997 --> 01:25:05.600
TERM -- SO FOR THE FARM WORKER

01:25:05.667 --> 01:25:07.836
PROGRAM WE IDENTIFIED THE TWELVE

01:25:07.902 --> 01:25:09.704
COUNTIES THE HAD THE HIGHS

01:25:09.771 --> 01:25:11.139
FORMER CO POPULATION.

01:25:11.206 --> 01:25:12.874
BUT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT THE

01:25:12.941 --> 01:25:14.676
FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAMMERS

01:25:14.742 --> 01:25:16.578
APPROXIMATE TEN MILLION DOLLARS

01:25:16.644 --> 01:25:18.713
WE'RE LOOKING AT WAYS -- TO TO

01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:20.448
EFFECTIVELY SUPPORT EFFECTIVE

01:25:20.515 --> 01:25:22.917

REQUIREMENTS AND ESTABLISH A

01:25:36.464 --> 01:25:37.999
PHYSICAL PRESENCE IN SERVING.

01:25:38.066 --> 01:25:39.634
THE INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES THAT

01:25:39.701 --> 01:25:41.870
MAKE UP EACH REGION AREA SO --

01:25:41.936 --> 01:25:43.371
THAT'S BASICALLY HOW THE PROGRAM

01:25:43.438 --> 01:25:45.974
IS STRUCTURED SO THAT YOU NICELY

01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:47.842

CALCULATED.

01:32:31.012 --> 01:32:32.113
THIS WOULD AVOID STAFFING

01:33:34.175 --> 01:33:35.242

01:33:35.309 --> 01:33:37.611
THE FUNDING PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU

01:33:37.678 --> 01:33:38.579
ALIGNS VERY WELL WITH THE

01:33:38.646 --> 01:33:40.481
ADMINISTRATION'S LARGER POLICY

01:33:40.548 --> 01:33:42.583
GOALS OF LIFTING CALIFORNIA'S

01:33:42.650 --> 01:33:43.651
CHILDREN OUT OF POVERTY.

01:33:43.718 --> 01:33:45.152
THIS INCREASE IN LOCAL CHILD

01:33:45.219 --> 01:33:46.454
SUPPORT FUNDING WILL RESULT IN

01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:48.923
BETTER LIVES FOR ABOUT ONE POINT

01:33:48.990 --> 01:33:49.457
THREE MILLION CHILDREN IN

01:33:49.523 --> 01:33:50.858
CALIFORNIA.

01:33:50.925 --> 01:33:52.460
THE STATE'S INVESTMENT OF

01:33:52.526 --> 01:33:53.427
NINETEEN POINT ONE MILLION IS

01:33:53.494 --> 01:33:55.062
MATCH TWO TO ONE WITH AN

01:33:55.129 --> 01:33:56.998
ADDITIONAL THIRTY SIX POINT NINE

01:33:57.064 --> 01:33:58.132
MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDS.

01:33:58.199 --> 01:33:59.200
THE UNDERLYING BUDGETING

01:33:59.266 --> 01:34:01.602
METHODOLOGY IS INTENDED TO BE

01:34:01.669 --> 01:34:03.204
ROLLED OUT OVER FOUR YEARS.

01:34:03.270 --> 01:34:04.505
REGIONAL CALL CENTER FUNDING IS

01:34:04.572 --> 01:34:05.773
INCLUDED FOR MERE ONE AND

01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:07.208
PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE FUNDS ARE

01:34:07.274 --> 01:34:09.777
ADDED TO THE METHODOLOGY IN YOUR

01:34:09.844 --> 01:34:10.845
FOR THE CHILD SUPPORT DIRECTORS

01:34:10.911 --> 01:34:12.179
ASSOCIATION HAS WORKED VERY

01:34:12.246 --> 01:34:13.447
CLOSELY WITH THE STATE

01:34:13.514 --> 01:34:14.315
DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT

01:34:14.382 --> 01:34:15.950
SERVICES TO DETERMINE THE

01:34:16.017 --> 01:34:17.651
FUNDING NEEDS OF LOCAL.

01:34:17.718 --> 01:34:19.253
VOTE OF THE LOCAL AGENCIES AND

01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:20.788
TO IDENTIFY THOSE COUNTIES WITH

01:34:20.855 --> 01:34:22.356
THE LOWEST LEVEL OF FUNDING FOR

01:34:22.423 --> 01:34:23.691
THEIR CASE SIZE.

01:34:23.758 --> 01:34:25.393
AS IT HAPPENS THOSE TWENTY ONE

01:34:25.459 --> 01:34:26.761
COUNTIES ARE ALSO AMONG THE

01:34:26.827 --> 01:34:28.295
POOREST OF THE CALIFORNIA

01:34:28.362 --> 01:34:29.230
COUNTIES.

01:34:29.296 --> 01:34:30.898
THE IMPACT OF LIMITED FUNDING ON

01:34:30.965 --> 01:34:33.100
POVERTY AVOIDANCE IS CLEAR LESS

01:34:33.167 --> 01:34:34.935
SPENDING RESULTS IN GREATER

01:34:35.002 --> 01:34:36.470
INSTANCE OF POVERTY.

01:34:36.537 --> 01:34:37.872
AND THAT IS EQUALLY TRUE IN

01:34:37.938 --> 01:34:38.839
CHILD SUPPORT.

01:34:38.906 --> 01:34:40.207
CHILD SUPPORT IS MANDATED BY

01:34:40.274 --> 01:34:42.143
FEDERAL REGULATION THE OFFICE OF

01:34:42.209 --> 01:34:43.477
CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT UNDER

01:34:43.544 --> 01:34:45.346
THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION OF

01:34:45.413 --> 01:34:45.913
CHILDREN'S AND FAT CHILDREN

01:34:45.980 --> 01:34:46.847
FAMILIES.

01:34:46.914 --> 01:34:48.716
HAS RECENTLY PROMULGATED WHAT IS

01:34:48.783 --> 01:34:50.284
KNOWN AS THE FINAL RULE.

01:34:50.351 --> 01:34:51.952
MOST OF THESE CHANGES TO THE

01:34:52.019 --> 01:34:53.421
VARIOUS STATES PROGRAMS IN THE

01:34:53.487 --> 01:34:55.523
FINAL RULE REQUIRE A SHIFT FROM

01:34:55.589 --> 01:34:58.159
SYSTEM GENERATED TASKS TO A MORE

01:34:58.225 --> 01:34:59.860
HUMAN CENTRIC TASK.

01:34:59.927 --> 01:35:01.695
THAT HUMAN CENTRIC MODE WILL

01:35:01.762 --> 01:35:03.330
LIKELY BE MORE COSTLY THAN THE

01:35:03.397 --> 01:35:04.832
SYSTEM GENERATED PROGRAM WITH

01:35:04.899 --> 01:35:07.201
MIGRATED TO UNDER PRESSURE OF

01:35:07.268 --> 01:35:08.102
LIMITED FUNDING.

01:35:08.169 --> 01:35:09.370
CALIFORNIA IS A LEADER IN SOCIAL

01:35:09.437 --> 01:35:10.738
POLICY AND HAS ALREADY

01:35:10.805 --> 01:35:12.139
IMPLEMENTED MOST OF THE FINAL

01:35:12.206 --> 01:35:13.774
RULE RECOMMENDATIONS HOWEVER

01:35:13.841 --> 01:35:15.109
MANY LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT

01:35:15.176 --> 01:35:16.477
AGENCIES LACKS SUFFICIENT

01:35:16.544 --> 01:35:18.245
RESOURCES NEEDED TO IMPLEMENT

01:35:18.312 --> 01:35:19.780
REMAINING FEDERAL CHANGES.

01:35:19.847 --> 01:35:21.449
AND REACH ADDITIONAL FAMILIES

01:35:21.515 --> 01:35:22.683
THAT COULD NOT PARTICIPATE IN

01:35:22.750 --> 01:35:24.185
THE CHILD SUPPORT PROGRAM.

01:35:24.251 --> 01:35:25.086
THE TWENTY ONE COUNTIES

01:35:25.152 --> 01:35:26.353
IDENTIFIED IN THE PROPOSED

01:35:26.420 --> 01:35:28.789
FUNDING HAVE BEEN TREADING WATER

01:35:28.856 --> 01:35:29.957
HOWEVER EACH YEAR WITH THE

01:35:30.024 --> 01:35:31.425
LIMITED FUNDS AVAILABLE THEY

01:35:31.492 --> 01:35:32.960
OFFER INNOVATIVE SERVICES

01:35:33.027 --> 01:35:34.061
INCLUDING.

01:35:34.128 --> 01:35:35.262
REFERRALS FOR EMPLOYMENT

01:35:35.329 --> 01:35:37.131
SERVICES POP UP AND MOBILE

01:35:37.198 --> 01:35:38.766
OFFICES OUT REACH TO

01:35:38.833 --> 01:35:40.000
INCARCERATED PARENTS

01:35:40.067 --> 01:35:41.435
ESTABLISHING ORDERS FOR HEALTH

01:35:41.502 --> 01:35:42.736
INSURANCE AND DEVELOPING

01:35:42.803 --> 01:35:44.505
ACHIEVABLE PAYMENT PLANS.

01:35:44.572 --> 01:35:45.973
THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT VARIATIONS

01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:47.508
IN FUNDING BETWEEN COUNTIES

01:35:47.575 --> 01:35:49.009
WHICH AFFECTS PERFORMANCE AND

01:35:49.076 --> 01:35:50.377
SERVICE TO FAMILIES.

01:35:50.444 --> 01:35:51.545
THE PROPOSED SPENDING IS A

01:35:51.612 --> 01:35:53.180
PRELIMINARY STEP TOWARD A

01:35:53.247 --> 01:35:54.782
REASONABLE FUNDING METHODOLOGY

01:35:54.849 --> 01:35:56.951
THANK YOU.

FINANCE I JUST REITERATE A LOT

01:36:04.024 --> 01:36:05.326
OF WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN SAID

01:36:05.392 --> 01:36:06.193
WHICH IS THAT.

01:36:06.260 --> 01:36:07.495
THEY'LL SAY SAY FUNNY PROPOSALS

01:36:07.561 --> 01:36:08.596
PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S EARLY

01:36:08.662 --> 01:36:10.197
CHILDHOOD BUDGET PACKAGE WHICH

01:36:10.264 --> 01:36:11.465
IS ONE OF HIS PRIORITIES.

01:36:11.532 --> 01:36:13.067
SPECIFICALLY THIS INVESTMENT IS

01:36:13.134 --> 01:36:14.668
INTENDED TO EASE THE FINANCIAL

01:36:14.735 --> 01:36:16.103
PRESSURES ON PARENTS THINKING

01:36:16.170 --> 01:36:17.738
ESCAPE THE CYCLE OF POVERTY AND

01:36:17.805 --> 01:36:19.406
FOCUS ON THE HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT.

01:36:19.473 --> 01:36:20.875
OF THEIR CHILDREN THE

01:36:20.941 --> 01:36:21.609
ADMINISTRATION VIEWS THIS

01:36:21.675 --> 01:36:22.877
INVESTMENT AS A BASELINE

01:36:22.943 --> 01:36:24.311
ADJUSTMENT TO CREATE A MORE

01:36:24.378 --> 01:36:25.980
EQUITABLE FUNDING DISTRIBUTION

01:36:26.046 --> 01:36:27.948
ACROSS ALL COUNTIES AND REDUCE

01:36:28.015 --> 01:36:29.416
GEOGRAPHIC AND DEMOGRAPHIC

01:36:29.483 --> 01:36:31.152
DISPARITIES IN FUNDING.

01:36:31.218 --> 01:36:32.486
AFTER FULL IMPLEMENTATION THE

01:36:32.553 --> 01:36:34.088
INCREASE COLLECTIONS RESULTING

01:36:34.155 --> 01:36:35.022
FROM THIS INVESTMENT WILL

01:36:35.089 --> 01:36:36.657
DIRECTLY BENEFIT FAMILIES AND

01:36:36.724 --> 01:36:37.958
REDUCE CHILD POVERTY

01:36:38.025 --> 01:36:38.926
PARTICULARLY LOW INCOME

01:36:38.993 --> 01:36:40.161
HOUSEHOLDS THAT TEND TO BE

01:36:40.227 --> 01:36:42.062
CONCENTRATED IN THE LCS SAYS

01:36:42.129 --> 01:36:43.497
THEY'RE CURRENTLY RELATIVELY

01:36:43.564 --> 01:36:44.532
UNDERFUNDED.

01:36:44.598 --> 01:36:46.367
AND HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.

01:36:46.433 --> 01:36:49.336
THANK YOU.

01:36:49.403 --> 01:36:50.971
NEXT WITNESS PLEASE.

01:36:51.038 --> 01:36:51.505
JACQUELINE ROSY WITH THE

01:36:51.572 --> 01:36:52.173
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE --

01:36:52.239 --> 01:36:53.340
A FEW WEEKS AGO OUR OFFICE

01:36:53.407 --> 01:36:54.608
RELEASED A REPORT IN WHICH WE

01:36:54.675 --> 01:36:55.843
DID AN ANALYSIS OF THE

01:36:55.910 --> 01:36:57.244
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL.

01:36:57.311 --> 01:36:58.579
IN THE REPORT WEEK KNOWLEDGE

01:36:58.646 --> 01:37:01.182
THAT YES THERE AND IS CONCERNED

01:37:01.248 --> 01:37:03.651
ABOUT FINDING AND HOW THAT IS --

01:37:03.717 --> 01:37:05.686
DECIDED IN TERMS OF FUNDING

01:37:05.753 --> 01:37:07.621
LEVELS FOR EACH LTSA -- WITH

01:37:07.688 --> 01:37:08.889
REGARD TO THE CURRENT BUDGET

01:37:08.956 --> 01:37:11.058
PROPOSAL AND THE PROPOSED NEW

01:37:11.125 --> 01:37:13.394
METHODOLOGY WE DID RAISE A

01:37:13.460 --> 01:37:15.763
NUMBER OF CONCERNS -- ONE BEING

01:37:15.829 --> 01:37:16.497
THAT WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S

01:37:16.564 --> 01:37:19.567
PREMATURE FOR TWO REASONS -- AS

01:37:19.633 --> 01:37:22.536
WAS NOTED -- IN THE AGENDA ON

01:37:22.603 --> 01:37:24.104
LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE DID

01:37:24.171 --> 01:37:26.774
PASS SOME REPORTING LANGUAGE

01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:28.509
THAT REQUIRED THE DEPARTMENT TO

01:37:28.576 --> 01:37:29.777
LOOK FOR OPERATIONAL

01:37:29.843 --> 01:37:31.412
EFFICIENCIES BOTH OF THE STATE

01:37:31.478 --> 01:37:32.780
AND LOCAL LEVELS.

01:37:32.846 --> 01:37:33.948
THAT WOULD THEN AND FORMER FINE

01:37:34.014 --> 01:37:35.916
MINTS TO THE BUDGET METHODOLOGY

01:37:35.983 --> 01:37:37.418
THAT SPECIFIC COMPONENT OF

01:37:37.484 --> 01:37:39.653
OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES IS DUE

01:37:39.720 --> 01:37:40.788
BY.

01:37:40.854 --> 01:37:43.757
JULY FIRST TWENTY NINETEEN I'M

01:37:43.824 --> 01:37:45.659
GIVEN THAT THAT IS PENDING --

01:37:45.726 --> 01:37:48.796
DEPENDING ON THE FINDINGS OF

01:37:48.862 --> 01:37:49.997
THAT REPORT -- THOSE OPERATIONAL

01:37:50.064 --> 01:37:51.398
EFFICIENCIES COULD HAVE SOME

01:37:51.465 --> 01:37:53.534
IMPLICATIONS ON BOTH THE AMOUNT

01:37:53.601 --> 01:37:55.135
OF TIME IT TAKES TO DO --

01:37:55.202 --> 01:37:57.871
EVERYDAY TASK OR RUN --

01:37:57.938 --> 01:38:00.140
ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM -- BUT

01:38:00.207 --> 01:38:03.010
THEN ALSO -- DOES A COULD --

01:38:03.077 --> 01:38:04.812
INFORM DIFFERENCES AND FUNDING

01:38:04.878 --> 01:38:06.847
LEVELS AND ALSO HOW FUNDS ARE

01:38:06.914 --> 01:38:08.983
ALLOCATED ACROSS ALL CSA'S

01:38:09.049 --> 01:38:10.651
ANOTHER REASON WHY WE FLAGS THAT

01:38:10.718 --> 01:38:12.019
THIS PROPOSAL THAT THE

01:38:12.086 --> 01:38:13.754
METHODOLOGY IN AND OF ITSELF MAY

01:38:13.821 --> 01:38:14.655
BE PREMATURE.

01:38:14.722 --> 01:38:17.024
AS WAS MENTIONED THE DEPARTMENT

01:38:17.091 --> 01:38:19.093
IS UNDERGOING -- A SERIES OF

01:38:19.159 --> 01:38:20.427
CONVERSATIONS ON HOW TO

01:38:20.494 --> 01:38:22.129
IMPLEMENT CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF

01:38:22.196 --> 01:38:24.832
THE FEDERAL FINAL RULE -- AS WAS

01:38:24.898 --> 01:38:26.634
NOTED SOME OF THESE COMPONENTS --

01:38:26.700 --> 01:38:28.569
COULD AFFECT -- EVERYDAY

01:38:28.636 --> 01:38:30.537
OPERATIONS OF THE PROGRAM EITHER

01:38:30.604 --> 01:38:33.374
REQUIRING MORE -- HUMAN CENTERED

01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:35.476
TOUCHES THAT COULD THEN REQUIRE

01:38:35.542 --> 01:38:39.146
HIGHER LEVELS OF A EFFORT -- BUT

01:38:39.213 --> 01:38:42.283
THEN ALSO MORE COST -- SO UNTIL

01:38:42.349 --> 01:38:45.986
WE HAVE A PLANT ON HOW WE'RE

01:38:46.053 --> 01:38:46.587
GOING TO ADDRESS THAT WE FIND

01:38:46.654 --> 01:38:47.087
THAT [inaudible]

01:38:47.154 --> 01:38:48.122
I'M.

01:38:48.188 --> 01:38:49.823
ADOPTING OF BUDGET METHODOLOGY

01:38:49.890 --> 01:38:52.092
MAY BE PREMATURE AT THAT TIME

01:38:52.159 --> 01:38:53.861
SETTING ON THOSE DIVIDE TWO

01:38:53.927 --> 01:38:55.663
CONCERNS ASIDE WE DID REVIEW THE

01:38:55.729 --> 01:38:56.864
TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THE

01:38:58.599 --> 01:39:00.000
NUMBER OF TECHNICAL CONCERNS.

01:39:00.067 --> 01:39:03.103

IT AND THERE ARE SET AS IN THE

01:39:05.439 --> 01:39:07.074
CALCULATION OF BASELINE STAFFING

01:39:07.141 --> 01:39:08.876
LEVELS A LEVEL OF EFFORT STUDY

01:39:08.942 --> 01:39:10.577
WAS CONDUCTED IN WHICH THEY

01:39:10.644 --> 01:39:11.945
SURVEYED FIFTEEN COUNTIES.

01:39:12.012 --> 01:39:14.915
LOOK DAD A MANDATED TASK TASK

01:39:14.982 --> 01:39:16.917
THAT ARE NEEDED JUST TO WORK AS

01:39:16.984 --> 01:39:19.620
AN EVERYDAY CHILD SUPPORT CASE --

01:39:19.687 --> 01:39:21.288
AND THEN TRY TO TIME EACH TASK

01:39:21.355 --> 01:39:22.489
OUT TO THEN DETERMINE THE

01:39:22.556 --> 01:39:25.793
NECESSARY -- EMPLOYEES AND

01:39:25.859 --> 01:39:27.294
THAT'S REQUIRED TO WORK A CASE.

01:39:27.361 --> 01:39:29.863
THAT LEVEL OF EFFORT STUDY ONLY

01:39:29.930 --> 01:39:31.031
PARTIALLY INFORMED TO THE

OVERALL BASE LEVEL OF STAFF.

01:39:33.334 --> 01:39:34.668
THAT THEY REACHED BUT EVEN

01:39:34.735 --> 01:39:36.103
WITHIN THAT LEVEL OF EFFORT

01:39:36.170 --> 01:39:38.072
STUDY IT DID DEMONSTRATE WIDE

01:39:38.138 --> 01:39:40.040
VARIATION AND HOW THE PROGRAM IS

01:39:40.107 --> 01:39:42.676
ADMINISTERED ACROSS ALSEA ESSAYS --

01:39:42.743 --> 01:39:45.079
AGAIN THAT IN IT OF ITSELF --

01:39:45.145 --> 01:39:46.480
DEMONSTRATE THAT THERE IS SOME

01:39:46.547 --> 01:39:48.582
LEVEL OF WIDE VARIATION IN HOW

01:39:48.649 --> 01:39:51.285
THE PROGRAM IS ADMINISTERED AND

01:39:51.352 --> 01:39:52.853
THAT COULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:54.455
THEN EVALUATE OUR THEIR

01:39:54.521 --> 01:39:56.357
OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES OR BEST

01:39:56.423 --> 01:39:57.958
PRACTICES THAT COULD BE LEARNED

01:39:58.025 --> 01:39:59.426
FROM CERTAIN LC ESSAYS.

01:39:59.493 --> 01:40:00.928
AND THEN IMPLEMENTED ACROSS THE

01:40:00.994 --> 01:40:03.130
SYSTEM ON THE PROPOSAL AS

01:40:03.197 --> 01:40:04.898
OPPOSED OF TAKING THAT APPROACH

01:40:04.965 --> 01:40:06.767
OF FUNDING TO THE BEST PRACTICE

01:40:06.834 --> 01:40:10.871
LEVEL JUST -- PICKED AN AVERAGE --

01:40:10.938 --> 01:40:12.373
SO IT HAS THOSE BIG TEN

01:40:12.439 --> 01:40:13.774
VARIATIONS AND THE PROPOSAL

01:40:13.841 --> 01:40:16.143
ITSELF AND LASTLY AS AS WAS

01:40:16.210 --> 01:40:18.479
NOTED IN YOUR AGENDA.

01:40:18.545 --> 01:40:20.581
THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT -- KEY

01:40:20.647 --> 01:40:22.282
COMPONENTS THAT ARE MISSING THAT --

01:40:22.349 --> 01:40:24.218
WOULD FACILITATE SOME FORM OF

01:40:24.284 --> 01:40:25.786
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT BOTH IN

01:40:25.853 --> 01:40:27.988
TERMS OF KNOWING HOW THE DOLLARS

01:40:28.055 --> 01:40:30.691
ARE SPENT ULTIMATELY BUTALSO A

01:40:30.758 --> 01:40:32.826
LACK OF METRICS OR A LEVEL OF

01:40:32.893 --> 01:40:33.694
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WE'RE

01:40:33.761 --> 01:40:36.130

01:40:37.831 --> 01:40:39.032
AS I SAID IN THE BEGINNING OF MY

01:40:39.099 --> 01:40:40.567
COMMENTS WE DID ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

01:40:40.634 --> 01:40:44.071
FUNDING IS A CONCERN -- SO IT'S

01:40:44.138 --> 01:40:48.542
SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:40:48.609 --> 01:40:49.710
COULD DO IN THE MEANTIME IS THAT

01:40:49.777 --> 01:40:50.577
WHILE IT'S DIFFICULT TO

01:40:50.644 --> 01:40:51.745

COULD PROVIDE STOP GAP FUNDING.

01:40:58.952 --> 01:41:00.788
AND ONE OF ONE OPTION IN THAT

01:41:00.854 --> 01:41:02.156
STOP GAP FUNDING COULD BE TO

01:41:02.222 --> 01:41:03.824

OUR BUDGET IS ABOUT ONE POINT

01:58:22.762 --> 01:58:23.763
ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN AND WE

01:58:23.830 --> 01:58:25.398
DISTRIBUTE OUT THE TWO POINT

01:58:25.465 --> 01:58:26.899
FIVE BILLION DOLLARS SO THAT'S

01:58:26.966 --> 01:58:27.433
THE TWO DOLLARS OF IT AS A

01:58:27.500 --> 01:58:28.901
RECOVERY.

01:58:28.968 --> 01:58:30.203
THE RECOVERY P. SPECIFICALLY IS

01:58:30.269 --> 01:58:31.904
ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE

01:58:31.971 --> 01:58:33.139

01:58:46.085 --> 01:58:48.454
OKAY.

01:58:48.521 --> 01:58:50.189
SO THERE'S A REPORT THAT SAYS

01:58:50.256 --> 01:58:51.724
IT'S DUE IN.

01:58:51.791 --> 01:58:53.626
JULY FIRST I BELIEVE THAT'S

01:58:53.693 --> 01:58:57.029
CORRECT -- COULD WE HAVE

01:58:57.096 --> 01:58:58.531
ACCELERATED THAT DATE BEFORE

01:58:58.598 --> 01:59:00.733
BUDGET.

01:59:00.800 --> 01:59:01.234
SO THAT WE COULD BE MORE

01:59:01.300 --> 01:59:02.268
INFORMED.

01:59:02.335 --> 01:59:04.070
A GOING FOR I KNOW WE ALWAYS

01:59:04.136 --> 01:59:04.904
HAVE THE ABILITY TO TRAILER BILL

01:59:04.971 --> 01:59:06.239
LATER.

01:59:06.305 --> 01:59:08.541
BUT WHY WOULDN'T WE HAVE IT

01:59:08.608 --> 01:59:10.610
BEFORE MAY REVISE SO WE WERE

01:59:10.676 --> 01:59:11.811
GIVEN.

01:59:11.878 --> 01:59:13.145
TO REQUIREMENTS LAST YEAR TO THE

01:59:13.212 --> 01:59:14.780
BUDGET CYCLE ONE WAS TO CREATE

01:59:14.847 --> 01:59:16.415
THIS METHODOLOGY IN THE SECOND

01:59:16.482 --> 01:59:17.850
WAS TO WORK ON EFFICIENCIES --

01:59:17.917 --> 01:59:19.185
SO WE SPENT A SIGNIFICANT

01:59:19.252 --> 01:59:21.320
PORTION OF THE FIRST PART OF

01:59:21.387 --> 01:59:23.155
LAST YEAR -- GELLING INTO

01:59:23.222 --> 01:59:24.690
JANUARY THIS YEAR TRYING TO GET

01:59:24.757 --> 01:59:26.592
THAT BUDGET METHODOLOGY IN PLACE

01:59:26.659 --> 01:59:27.426
IN TIME FOR THE GOVERNOR PUT OUT

HIS BUDGET AS SOON AS THAT WAS

01:59:29.328 --> 01:59:30.329
AND WE TURN OUR ATTENTION TO

01:59:30.396 --> 01:59:31.564
DEFICIENCIES REPORT.

01:59:31.631 --> 01:59:32.665
THAT'S UNDER DEVELOPMENT RIGHT

01:59:32.732 --> 01:59:34.901
NOW WE'RE WORKING VERY HARD TO

01:59:34.967 --> 01:59:35.468
TRY AND GET THAT OUT BY JULY

01:59:35.535 --> 01:59:36.669
FIRST.

01:59:36.736 --> 01:59:37.270
SOARING APRIL DO YOU HAVE A

01:59:37.336 --> 01:59:38.004
DRAFT.

01:59:38.070 --> 01:59:39.505
WE HAVE A AT THE START OF

01:59:39.572 --> 01:59:40.806
CHAPTER THINK ALL OF THE PIECES

01:59:40.873 --> 01:59:41.807
ARE PUT TOGETHER WORKING ON THE

01:59:41.874 --> 01:59:43.109
FINALIZATION THERE.

01:59:43.175 --> 01:59:44.143
THERE ARE EFFICIENCIES IN IT

01:59:44.210 --> 01:59:45.211
THERE'S THERE'S DEFINITELY

01:59:45.278 --> 01:59:46.512
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE CHILD

01:59:46.579 --> 01:59:48.247
SUPPORT PROGRAM TO IMPROVE THEIR

01:59:48.314 --> 01:59:49.649
NOT EFFICIENCIES IN THAT REPORT

01:59:49.715 --> 01:59:50.783
THAT ARE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN%

01:59:50.850 --> 01:59:52.985
SAVINGS TOWARDS MOVING AS A LOT

01:59:53.052 --> 01:59:54.353
OF THE EFFICIENCIES THAT WE ARE

01:59:54.420 --> 01:59:54.587
BEING.

01:59:54.654 --> 01:59:56.222
WE ARE HIGHLIGHTING AND REALLY

01:59:56.289 --> 01:59:58.357
GO TOWARDS MORE EFFICIENTLY

01:59:58.424 --> 01:59:59.625
DELIVERING THE SERVICES THAN THE

01:59:59.692 --> 02:00:00.660
CHILD SUPPORT PROGRAM.

02:00:00.726 --> 02:00:02.228
THERE ARE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES

02:00:02.295 --> 02:00:03.262
LIKE THE CALL CENTER RE AT

02:00:03.329 --> 02:00:04.530
REGIONALIZATION THE CALL CENTERS

02:00:04.597 --> 02:00:06.232
WAS A A BIG COST SAVINGS FOR THE

02:00:06.299 --> 02:00:07.300
STATE I THINK THERE'S

02:00:07.366 --> 02:00:08.501
OPPORTUNITIES IN THE TRAINING

02:00:08.568 --> 02:00:09.735
ENVIRONMENT AND A FEW THINGS

02:00:09.802 --> 02:00:10.469
LIKE THAT TO REGIONALES

02:00:10.536 --> 02:00:12.238
TRAININGS AND REALIZE SOME OF

02:00:12.305 --> 02:00:13.573
THE SPECIALTY TYPE SERVICES.

02:00:13.639 --> 02:00:15.107
THE CORE OF WHAT WE DO THOUGH AT

02:00:15.174 --> 02:00:16.442
THE LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES

02:00:16.509 --> 02:00:17.977
IS ABOUT AN INDIVIDUAL SITTING

02:00:18.044 --> 02:00:19.512
IN FRONT OF FAMILY -- AND

02:00:19.579 --> 02:00:20.646
WORKING ON THEIR FINANCIAL

02:00:20.713 --> 02:00:22.214
ISSUES TO GET IT OUT THERE SO

02:00:22.281 --> 02:00:23.049
THERE ISN'T A WHOLE LOT MORE

02:00:23.115 --> 02:00:24.584
WE'VE ALREADY SPENT TWO DECADES

02:00:24.650 --> 02:00:25.651
REALLY TRYING TO REFINE

02:00:25.718 --> 02:00:27.620

02:00:30.890 --> 02:00:31.691

02:01:13.165 --> 02:01:14.266
GEARING UP TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT

02:01:14.333 --> 02:01:15.201
HOW THEY'RE GOING TO REPLACE

02:01:15.267 --> 02:01:15.968
THOSE BUT FROM A FUNDING

02:01:16.035 --> 02:01:17.303
PERSPECTIVE OF THE

02:01:47.166 --> 02:01:49.902
MY COUNTY STANDS TO GAIN

02:01:49.969 --> 02:01:51.437
SUBSTANTIALLY FROM THE

02:01:51.504 --> 02:01:52.905
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL.

THE METHODOLOGY HOUSE TO BE IN

02:02:07.353 --> 02:02:09.855
PLACE WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

02:02:09.922 --> 02:02:12.258
EXACTLY HOW THEY WERE.

GOING TO USE THE GOVERNOR'S

02:02:19.965 --> 02:02:21.200
MONEY.

AND THEN WE NEED TO CODIFY IT.

02:02:22.802 --> 02:02:25.271
OF SO WHAT IS THE

02:02:25.337 --> 02:02:26.872
ADMINISTRATION'S PERSPECTIVE.

02:02:26.939 --> 02:02:28.407
ON THE APPROACH BY THE

02:02:37.183 --> 02:02:39.852
TWENTY SEVEN IN THE AGENDA.

02:02:39.919 --> 02:02:41.954
SO SIMILAR TO THAT THE THE WHOLE

02:02:42.021 --> 02:02:43.255

GOVERNOR'S BUDGET LAST YEAR THE

02:02:44.957 --> 02:02:45.424
EIGHT POINT EIGHT MILLION

02:02:45.491 --> 02:02:46.792
DOLLARS WAS REALLY THREE MILLION

02:02:46.859 --> 02:02:47.326
DOLLARS THAT WE FEDERALLY

02:02:47.393 --> 02:02:49.095
MATCHED -- YOU CAN KIND OF SEE

02:02:49.161 --> 02:02:50.763
THE S. MAY NEW F. TO EASE THAT

02:02:50.830 --> 02:02:51.964
WERE AND THE NEED TO BE BROAD

02:02:52.031 --> 02:02:53.432
ENOUGH THAT MONEY THERE'S AN

02:02:53.499 --> 02:02:54.934
EXPECTATION THAT THIS MONEY

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:56.435
PREDOMINATELY GOES TOWARDS.

02:02:56.502 --> 02:02:57.770
AND THE INCREASE IN STAFF AND

02:02:57.837 --> 02:02:59.672
THESE TWENTY ONE COUNTIES THE

02:02:59.739 --> 02:03:01.173
GOAL IS TO GET THEM TO THAT --

02:03:01.240 --> 02:03:03.042
FTE CASELOAD RATIO THAT WE'RE

02:03:03.109 --> 02:03:04.777
EXPECTING IN THE IN THE FUNDING

02:03:04.844 --> 02:03:05.845
METHODOLOGY.

02:03:05.911 --> 02:03:07.046
WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING

02:03:07.113 --> 02:03:08.781
SPECIFICALLY HARD AND FAST TO TO

02:03:08.848 --> 02:03:10.783
NECESSARILY HOLD THE COUNTY

02:03:10.850 --> 02:03:11.617
ACCOUNTABLE THEM FROM THE

02:03:11.684 --> 02:03:13.119
STATE'S PERSPECTIVE WE ALLOCATE

02:03:13.185 --> 02:03:14.453
ACCORDING TO THIS MODEL WE GIVE

02:03:14.520 --> 02:03:16.055
THE COUNTIES THE MODEL AND THEN

02:03:16.122 --> 02:03:17.356
THIS IS A STATE RUN LOCALLY

02:03:17.423 --> 02:03:19.191
OPERATED MODEL THIS LOCAL COUNTY

02:03:19.258 --> 02:03:20.292
DIRECTORS DO HAVE SOME

02:03:20.359 --> 02:03:21.193
DISCRETION IN.

02:03:21.260 --> 02:03:24.663
AND DECISION MAKING AS TO HOW

02:03:24.730 --> 02:03:25.297
THEY UTILIZE THAT FUNDING. ONE

02:03:25.364 --> 02:03:28.467
OF THE SUGGESTIONS FROM STAFF LA --

02:03:28.534 --> 02:03:30.870
IS THE NEED TO ADOPT FORMALIZED

02:03:30.936 --> 02:03:32.805
METHODOLOGY WHAT IS THE

02:03:32.872 --> 02:03:34.240
ADMINISTRATION'S RESPONSE --

02:03:34.306 --> 02:03:35.508
RESPONSE TO THAT.

02:03:35.574 --> 02:03:37.076
SO I AGREE THERE ISN'T NEED TO

02:03:37.143 --> 02:03:38.410
ADOPT THE FUNDING METHODOLOGY

02:03:38.477 --> 02:03:40.513
FORMALIZING CODIFYING I WOULD BE

02:03:40.579 --> 02:03:42.414
HESITANT TO CODIFY THAT

02:03:42.481 --> 02:03:43.849
NECESSARILY TODAY WE HAVE A

02:03:43.916 --> 02:03:45.818
PRETTY STRONG A METHODOLOGY

02:03:45.885 --> 02:03:47.887
THAT'S OUT THERE I THINK WE HAVE

02:03:47.953 --> 02:03:49.455
A GOOD FEEL ABOUT WHAT THAT IS --

02:03:49.522 --> 02:03:50.489
BUT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE'VE

02:03:50.556 --> 02:03:51.390
HAD A METHODOLOGY IN CHILD

02:03:51.457 --> 02:03:52.892
SUPPORT PROGRAM IN TWENTY YEARS

02:03:52.958 --> 02:03:54.193
IT WOULD BE NICE TO SEE THAT

02:03:54.260 --> 02:03:55.361
THREE YEARS AND HOW THIS MONEY

02:03:55.427 --> 02:03:56.328
IS UTILIZED.

02:03:56.395 --> 02:03:57.797
AND HOW THE METHODOLOGY PLAYS

02:03:57.863 --> 02:03:58.998
OUT BEFORE YOU OFFICIALLY

02:03:59.064 --> 02:04:00.733
CODIFIED BUT IF THERE'S LANGUAGE

02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:01.767
OR SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO

02:04:01.834 --> 02:04:02.768
HAVE IN THERE THAT THAT MOVES

02:04:02.835 --> 02:04:05.104
TOWARD CODIFYING THAT WE'RE

02:04:05.171 --> 02:04:08.507
HAPPY TO DO SO.

02:04:08.574 --> 02:04:10.176
WELL I I WOULD ASK.

02:04:10.242 --> 02:04:12.244
THAT THE DEPARTMENT THAT AND THE

02:04:12.311 --> 02:04:13.946
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE.

02:04:14.013 --> 02:04:16.081
OUT WORK WITH OUR STAFF TO

02:04:16.148 --> 02:04:17.583
DEVELOP THAT TRADE A BIT TRAILER

02:04:17.650 --> 02:04:19.485
BUT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE --

02:04:19.552 --> 02:04:22.188
BUZZ BUDGET A BILL LANGUAGE.

02:04:22.254 --> 02:04:24.156
IT IS IMPORTANT WE DO NEED TO

02:04:24.223 --> 02:04:29.461
CODIFY IT -- THERE HAS TO BE A

02:04:29.528 --> 02:04:31.597
AS WAS AS WAS NOTED BY THE LA --

02:04:31.664 --> 02:04:35.634
MORE FORMALIZED METHODOLOGY -- I

02:04:35.701 --> 02:04:37.469
I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

02:04:37.536 --> 02:04:39.205
THAT YOU HAVE A FEEL FOR IT.

02:04:39.271 --> 02:04:41.373
UNFORTUNATELY.

02:04:41.440 --> 02:04:43.309
OR FORTUNATELY I I DON'T KNOW.

02:04:43.375 --> 02:04:45.144
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT?

02:04:45.211 --> 02:04:46.579
FINALLY GETTING.

02:04:46.645 --> 02:04:49.548
OF THE ADDITIONAL MONEY THAT HAS

02:04:49.615 --> 02:04:50.983
BEEN NEEDED FOR SO LONG.

02:04:51.050 --> 02:04:53.485
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE DO HAVE

02:04:53.552 --> 02:04:55.054
THE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR IT AND

02:04:55.120 --> 02:04:57.690
THAT -- YOU FOR EXPECTING THE

02:04:57.756 --> 02:04:59.391
COUNTIES TO SPEND IT IN A

02:04:59.458 --> 02:05:00.793
PARTICULAR WAY.

02:05:00.860 --> 02:05:02.628
AND THEY HAVE TO REPORT THERE

02:05:02.695 --> 02:05:04.396
HAS TO BE A THE METHODOLOGY SET

02:05:04.463 --> 02:05:07.099
IN PLACE AND THAT HAS TO BE FROM

02:05:07.166 --> 02:05:07.933
THE STATE.

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:09.668
WE CAN'T LATER SAY WILL CENTER

02:05:09.735 --> 02:05:10.636
TO DO YOU KNOW YOU DIDN'T DO

02:05:10.703 --> 02:05:12.104
WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO.

02:05:12.171 --> 02:05:13.205
THEIR HANDS ARE GOING TO GO UP

02:05:13.272 --> 02:05:14.506
SO WHAT WERE WE SUPPOSED TO DO

02:05:14.573 --> 02:05:16.041
WE USE THE MONEY WE DID

02:05:16.108 --> 02:05:17.676
EVERYTHING THE WAY WE FELT WE

02:05:17.743 --> 02:05:18.711
SHOULD DO IT.

02:05:18.777 --> 02:05:20.179
AND THAT WOULD BE TRUE FOR

02:05:20.246 --> 02:05:21.614
EVERYONE OF THE COUNTIES.

02:05:21.680 --> 02:05:23.983
I WANT MY COUNTY AND I AND

02:05:24.049 --> 02:05:24.550
EVERYBODY ELSE WANTS THEIR

02:05:24.617 --> 02:05:27.019
COUNTY TO RECEIVE THE MONEY THAT

02:05:27.086 --> 02:05:28.621
IS SO SO NEEDED.

02:05:28.687 --> 02:05:29.889
I THINK WE WE WOULD ALL AGREE

02:05:29.955 --> 02:05:31.323
WITH EVERY EVERY COMMENT THAT

02:05:31.390 --> 02:05:33.325
WAS MADE ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT IT

IS ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE CHILDREN

02:05:35.027 --> 02:05:36.829
IN DEEP POVERTY.

02:05:36.896 --> 02:05:38.597
THIS IS MONEY THAT IS NEEDED.

02:05:38.664 --> 02:05:40.699
BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO BE PRUDENT

02:05:40.766 --> 02:05:42.768

ONCE THE MONEY IS GIVEN.

02:05:45.905 --> 02:05:46.872

SAY WHAT DID YOU DO IT DID YOU

02:05:48.774 --> 02:05:49.742

SOLANO IS 3% AUGMENTATION -- AND

02:07:31.777 --> 02:07:33.912
THEN CONTRA COSTA IS 15% I THINK

02:07:33.979 --> 02:07:35.414

SEE CHILDREN HARM.

02:22:17.762 --> 02:22:20.231
BUT I DO TO HAVE A CONCERN THAT

02:22:20.298 --> 02:22:21.366

ULTIMATELY WORK OUT FOR THE KIDS?

02:22:28.306 --> 02:22:29.474
THIS IS A KIND OF A LOT TO WORTH

02:22:29.540 --> 02:22:31.643
IT BUT DEPARTMENT ON THIS I'D

02:22:31.709 --> 02:22:34.445

THANK YOU BYE I DO WANT TO ASK

02:22:36.781 --> 02:22:39.384
THE DIRECTOR -- HOW WIDESPREAD

02:22:39.450 --> 02:22:41.019
THE PENAL CODE VIOLATION OF

02:22:41.085 --> 02:22:42.687
CONTEMPT?

02:22:42.754 --> 02:22:48.092
ARE USED AS TOOLS CONTENT.

02:22:48.159 --> 02:22:50.028
THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF

02:22:50.094 --> 02:22:52.864
CONTENT THERE'S A CRIMINAL

02:22:52.931 --> 02:22:53.998
CONTEMPT IN A CIVIL CONTEMPT

02:22:54.065 --> 02:22:55.300
CRIMINAL CONTEMPT IS A VERY

02:22:55.366 --> 02:22:57.135
COSTLY PROGRAMMING HAS BEEN

02:22:57.201 --> 02:22:58.903
VIRTUALLY COMPLETELY ELIMINATE

02:22:58.970 --> 02:22:59.737
ACROSS ALL THE COUNTIES ACROSS

02:22:59.804 --> 02:23:00.471
THE STATE.

02:23:00.538 --> 02:23:01.906
AND THE IDEA OF GOING AFTER AND

02:23:01.973 --> 02:23:03.007
CREATING SOME SORT OF CRIMINAL

02:23:03.074 --> 02:23:04.208
VIOLATION IN THE PUTTING SOMEONE

02:23:04.275 --> 02:23:05.443
IN JAIL BECAUSE OF CHILD SUPPORT

02:23:05.510 --> 02:23:07.145
IS CLEARLY NOT GOING TO IMPROVE

02:23:07.211 --> 02:23:07.779
THE BENEFIT.

02:23:07.845 --> 02:23:10.181
AND TO THE CHILD THAT THE PERSON

02:23:10.248 --> 02:23:11.549
NEEDS TO BE OUT NEED BE WORKING

02:23:11.616 --> 02:23:13.051
THE CIVIL CONTEMPT IS A PROCESS

02:23:13.117 --> 02:23:15.320
THAT WE USE -- PRIMARILY AS A

02:23:15.386 --> 02:23:17.822
TOOL TO GET SOMEONE INTO OUR

02:23:17.889 --> 02:23:19.891
OFFICE AND ENGAGE WITH THAT AS

02:23:19.958 --> 02:23:20.558
LONG AS THEY'RE ENGAGING WITH US

02:23:20.625 --> 02:23:21.359
WE DON'T MOVE.

02:23:21.426 --> 02:23:22.827
THE FOLKS AT IGNORE US THAT

02:23:22.894 --> 02:23:24.262
TENDS TO GO THROUGH THE WHOLE

02:23:24.329 --> 02:23:25.463
PROCESS AND I DON'T THINK THAT.

02:23:25.530 --> 02:23:27.565
AND THE FINAL CONTEMPT RESULT

02:23:27.632 --> 02:23:29.534
ACTUALLY HELPS THEM IT PROBABLY

02:23:29.600 --> 02:23:30.134
HURTS THEM MORE FROM GETTING

02:23:30.201 --> 02:23:32.070
THEIR JOB BUT LACKING THE

02:23:32.136 --> 02:23:33.705
DRIVER'S LICENSE OR CONTEMPT

02:23:33.771 --> 02:23:35.540
ACTION TO SPUR SOMEBODY TO

02:23:35.606 --> 02:23:36.240
ENGAGE WITH US.

02:23:36.307 --> 02:23:38.109
WE DO STRUGGLE WITH GETTING

02:23:38.176 --> 02:23:39.310
SOMEONE.

02:23:39.377 --> 02:23:40.912
TO OPEN THEIR MAIL OR CALL US

02:23:40.979 --> 02:23:42.213
SOARING ENGAGE WITH US IN ANY

02:23:42.280 --> 02:23:43.181
SORT OF HUESO.

02:23:43.247 --> 02:23:44.549
AND THAT'S WHAT THE CONTENT

02:23:44.615 --> 02:23:46.351
PROCESSES USED -- FOR I CAN'T

02:23:46.417 --> 02:23:48.086
THINK OF A TIME WHEN WE PUT

02:23:48.152 --> 02:23:49.387
SOMEONE IN JAIL BECAUSE OF CHILD

02:23:49.454 --> 02:23:50.655
SUPPORT STILLER CRIMINAL I'D

02:23:50.722 --> 02:23:51.656
HAVE TO GO BACK.

02:23:51.723 --> 02:23:53.057
A LONG WAYS TO FIND ONE OF THOSE

02:23:53.124 --> 02:23:54.993
EXAMPLES AND BUT THERE ARE

02:23:55.059 --> 02:23:56.961
INCIDENCES AND HE'S SPEAKING

02:23:57.028 --> 02:23:57.729
MORE TO FOLKS THAT ARE IN

02:23:57.795 --> 02:23:59.130
POVERTY AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT

02:23:59.197 --> 02:24:01.199
THE CONTEMPT PROCESS ITSELF IS

02:24:01.265 --> 02:24:02.900
MOST BENEFICIAL WHEN WE ACTIVELY

02:24:02.967 --> 02:24:04.302
KNOW SOMEONE IS HIDING FROM US

02:24:04.369 --> 02:24:06.170
OR ATTEMPTING TO AVOID US AND

02:24:06.237 --> 02:24:06.871
THAT.

02:24:06.938 --> 02:24:08.206
IS OUR ONE OF OUR STRONGEST

02:24:08.272 --> 02:24:10.008
REMEDIES TO REALLY GET THE COR

02:24:10.074 --> 02:24:11.943
INVOLVED AND MAKE SOMEONE PAY

02:24:12.010 --> 02:24:13.644
WHO HAS THE KEPT CAPABILITY AND

02:24:13.711 --> 02:24:18.549
THE CAPACITY TO PAY BUT IS JUST

02:24:18.616 --> 02:24:22.653
ACTIVELY CHOOSING NOT.

02:24:22.720 --> 02:24:24.022
TO YES MOST FRESH.

02:24:24.088 --> 02:24:25.056
IS THERE A NUMBER THAT YOU HAVE.

02:24:25.123 --> 02:24:26.791
THAT IS COLLECTIBLE RIGHT NOW.

02:24:26.858 --> 02:24:28.126
TO ALL OF THE FAMILIES IN

02:24:28.192 --> 02:24:28.559
CALIFORNIA.

02:24:28.626 --> 02:24:30.361
THE NEEDS TO BE COLLECTED.

02:24:30.428 --> 02:24:31.863
WELL THE ARREARS BALANCE IN

02:24:31.929 --> 02:24:33.631
CALIFORNIA IS ABOUT EIGHTEEN

02:24:33.698 --> 02:24:37.935
BILLION DOLLARS IN ARREARS DO.

02:24:38.002 --> 02:24:40.438
HOW MUCH OF THAT IS INTEREST?

02:24:40.505 --> 02:24:41.806
A BIG PORTION OF THAT IS

02:24:41.873 --> 02:24:42.907
INTERESTS AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF

02:24:42.974 --> 02:24:45.843
10% RATE NAM I AM BELIEVE FOR AT

02:24:45.910 --> 02:24:47.612
ABOUT NINE MILLION OR EIGHT

02:24:47.678 --> 02:24:50.214
MILLION IN PRINCIPLE ON THE

02:24:50.281 --> 02:24:52.216
BALANCE IN INTEREST.

02:24:52.283 --> 02:24:53.317
BUT OKAY THOSE NUMBERS BECAUSE

02:24:53.384 --> 02:24:53.951
I'M GOING OFF TOP OF MY HEAD.

02:24:54.018 --> 02:24:55.086
IS THERE EVER BEEN A PROGRAM

02:24:55.153 --> 02:24:56.320
THAT WOULD WAIVE THE WILL

02:24:56.387 --> 02:24:58.856
INTEREST IF IT WAS A MADE.

02:24:58.923 --> 02:25:01.092
OF THERE ARE OTHER STATES THAT

02:25:01.159 --> 02:25:02.193
WAVE THE INTEREST TO AND THE

02:25:02.260 --> 02:25:03.094
CHANCE FOR PROGRAM THE ONLY

02:25:03.161 --> 02:25:04.462
COLLECT PRINCIPLE THERE ARE

02:25:04.529 --> 02:25:06.130
STATES THAT HAVE A 0% INTEREST

02:25:06.197 --> 02:25:07.899
RATE 3% INTEREST RATE CALIFORNIA

02:25:07.965 --> 02:25:09.700
IS SET AT TEN AND THAT'S THAT

02:25:09.767 --> 02:25:11.335
ACROSS ALL OF THE JUDICIAL

02:25:11.402 --> 02:25:12.637
MATTERS SO IT'S NOT JUST OUR

02:25:12.703 --> 02:25:13.037
INTEREST.

02:25:13.104 --> 02:25:14.572

THAT SPEAKING TO INTEREST RATES

02:25:21.879 --> 02:25:23.214
MAYBE 10% IS NOT THE RIGHT

02:25:23.281 --> 02:25:24.816
NUMBER FOR AND I KNOW THE DMV

02:25:24.882 --> 02:25:30.788

02:28:09.914 --> 02:28:11.249
UP WITH AN ORDER THREE HUNDRED

02:28:11.315 --> 02:28:12.283
AND TWENTY DOLLARS AND THEY

02:28:12.350 --> 02:28:14.085
CAN'T PAY WHY NOT GIVE THEM IN

02:28:14.151 --> 02:28:15.586
ORDER THAT THEY CAN PAY.

02:28:15.653 --> 02:28:16.621
IT THROUGH THE BELOW THE FEDERAL

02:28:16.687 --> 02:28:18.389
POVERTY POVERTY LEVEL TO GET

02:28:18.456 --> 02:28:19.257
THEM STARTED WE CAN ALWAYS

02:28:19.323 --> 02:28:20.658
INCREASE IT IF THEY BECOME

02:28:20.725 --> 02:28:21.692
EMPLOYED.

02:28:21.759 --> 02:28:22.927
THEN THE OTHER FIFTY DOLLAR

02:28:22.994 --> 02:28:24.395
ORDER IN NEW YORK HAS TO DO WITH

02:28:24.462 --> 02:28:26.831
SOMEONE BEING BELOW 2100% OF THE

02:28:26.897 --> 02:28:28.332
FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL I THINK

02:28:28.399 --> 02:28:29.400
THERE'S A LOT THERE WHAT THEY'RE

02:28:29.467 --> 02:28:30.935
DOING THAT WE SHOULD BE

02:28:31.002 --> 02:28:32.069
CONSIDERING HERE IN CALIFORNIA

02:28:32.136 --> 02:28:32.370
[inaudible]

02:28:32.436 --> 02:28:33.704
THANKS [inaudible]

02:28:33.771 --> 02:28:38.476
THANK YOU.

02:28:38.542 --> 02:28:40.778
IN GOING BACK TO TO SOME OF THE

02:28:40.845 --> 02:28:41.312
TOOLS ARE USED.

02:28:41.379 --> 02:28:43.648
DO.

02:28:43.714 --> 02:28:45.549
DO THE PRACTICES WHETHER WERE

02:28:45.616 --> 02:28:46.884
USING THE PENAL CODE OR THE

02:28:46.951 --> 02:28:48.185
DRIVER'S LICENSE.

02:28:48.252 --> 02:28:50.988
DO THESE PRACTICES IMPROVE

02:28:51.055 --> 02:28:52.556
FAMILY ENGAGEMENT.

02:28:52.623 --> 02:28:53.624
IT'S VERY HARD FOR US TO

02:28:53.691 --> 02:28:54.792
DETERMINE WHETHER.

02:28:54.859 --> 02:28:55.993
THE FAMILY THE MOM AND DAD ARE

02:28:56.060 --> 02:28:57.161
ACTUALLY TALKING TO EACH OTHER

02:28:57.228 --> 02:28:58.429
AND NOT TO OR WHETHER CHILD

02:28:58.496 --> 02:29:00.665
SUPPORT IS THE IS THE THING

02:29:00.731 --> 02:29:01.832
THAT'S BRINGING THEM TOGETHER AT

02:29:01.899 --> 02:29:03.100
THE THING THAT'S KEEPING THEM

02:29:03.167 --> 02:29:04.835
APART -- I THINK IT'S HAPPENING

02:29:04.902 --> 02:29:07.438
BOTH WAYS RIGHT NOW -- BECAUSE

02:29:07.505 --> 02:29:09.807
WE'RE WE HAVE THAT CHILD SUPPORT

02:29:09.874 --> 02:29:10.741
ORDER RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF

02:29:10.808 --> 02:29:12.843
EVERYTHING SO THAT I CAN'T TELL

02:29:12.910 --> 02:29:14.645
YOU HOW WELL WE ARE CREATING AN

02:29:14.712 --> 02:29:16.681
ENGAGEMENT PERSPECTIVE PER SE OR

02:29:16.747 --> 02:29:18.249
A SEPARATION BECAUSE WE'RE

02:29:18.316 --> 02:29:20.718
EXPECTING A PERSON PAY THEIR

02:29:20.785 --> 02:29:21.352
CHILD SUPPORT AND THEY MIGHT BE

02:29:21.419 --> 02:29:22.253
UPSET ABOUT THAT.

02:29:22.320 --> 02:29:23.154
THANK YOU.

02:29:23.220 --> 02:29:25.222
I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS ABOUT

02:29:25.289 --> 02:29:27.224
THE FACT THAT TWO THIRDS.

02:29:27.291 --> 02:29:29.093
OF NONCUSTODIAL PARENTS THAT ARE

02:29:29.160 --> 02:29:31.629
IN ARREARS ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN

02:29:31.696 --> 02:29:37.168
AND LATINO -- IT THEY ARE ALSO --

02:29:37.234 --> 02:29:38.569
AT BELOW THE POVERTY LEVEL.

02:29:38.636 --> 02:29:41.872
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR.

02:29:41.939 --> 02:29:43.641
THAT HAS TO BE CONSIDERED WE

02:29:43.708 --> 02:29:45.176
ABSOLUTELY WANT TO COLLECT THE

02:29:45.242 --> 02:29:46.644
CHILD SUPPORT THERE'S NO

02:29:46.711 --> 02:29:48.212
QUESTION ABOUT THAT BUT WE ALSO

02:29:48.279 --> 02:29:49.814
HAVE TO LOOK AT THE RULES AND

02:29:49.880 --> 02:29:52.516
HOW THEY AFFECT THOSE WHO CAN

02:29:52.583 --> 02:29:53.184
LEAST.

02:29:53.250 --> 02:29:57.054
AFFORD TO HAVE.

02:29:57.121 --> 02:29:59.023
HAVE THE RULES SET IN SUCH A WAY

02:29:59.090 --> 02:30:00.758
THAT IT JUST PUTS THEM FURTHER

02:30:00.825 --> 02:30:02.426
AND FURTHER NOT ONLY FOR THE

02:30:02.493 --> 02:30:03.861
FURTHER INTO POVERTY.

02:30:03.928 --> 02:30:05.496
BUT ALSO FURTHER AND FURTHER

02:30:05.563 --> 02:30:06.597
INTO THE SHADOWS.

02:30:06.664 --> 02:30:09.567
AND THEN THAT WORKS JUST EXACTLY

02:30:09.633 --> 02:30:12.203
AGAINST FAMILY ENGAGEMENT WHICH

02:30:12.269 --> 02:30:13.704
BECOMES A SERIOUSPROBLEM I

02:30:13.771 --> 02:30:15.306
THINK NEW YORK MAY BE ON TO

02:30:15.373 --> 02:30:16.941
SOMETHING -- MAYBE THAT'S

02:30:17.007 --> 02:30:18.676
SOMETHING WE WE SHOULD TAKE A

02:30:18.743 --> 02:30:21.078
LOOK AT BUT I SINCERELY

02:30:21.145 --> 02:30:24.081
APPRECIATE -- THE THE THE

02:30:24.148 --> 02:30:26.650
PRESENTATION THE PROPOSAL ANY

02:30:26.717 --> 02:30:28.285
