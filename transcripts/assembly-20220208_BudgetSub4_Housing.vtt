00:45:28.425 --> 00:45:30.561
NOT IN MIND AS WELL WHEN YOU

00:45:30.627 --> 00:45:33.030

SPACES WE GET- WE WORK IN A SILO

00:45:51.982 --> 00:45:53.450

00:45:53.517 --> 00:45:55.686
FUNDING AND RESOURCES AND THEN

THINGS THAT WE CAN DO IS

00:46:00.224 --> 00:46:01.892

LAST COUPLE YEARS WITH THE

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:48.539
OBJECTIONS AND CULTIVATED PEOPLE

00:46:48.605 --> 00:46:49.873
LOSING THEIR JOBS IT'S JUST

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:52.242

01:10:35.998 --> 01:10:37.833

THE- COUNCIL IS REALLY ADEPT.

01:10:54.984 --> 01:10:57.152

01:11:00.389 --> 01:11:03.993
REGIS- IT- IT'S- TO ALLOW FOR

01:11:04.059 --> 01:11:05.995
THEIR TO BE A- CHAIR. WITH

HOUSING AND HUMAN EACH AS WELL

01:11:07.262 --> 01:11:08.330
AS A LITTLE SOME OF THE OTHER

01:11:08.397 --> 01:11:09.698
PARTICIPANTS. FROM JUST

01:11:09.765 --> 01:11:10.833

DIRECTORS OF DEPARTMENTS. AND

01:11:14.336 --> 01:11:16.038
HOW THAT'LL WORK IN PRACTICE AND

01:11:16.105 --> 01:11:18.807
ENCOURAGING GREATER COORDINATION

01:11:18.874 --> 01:11:20.075
IS YET TO BE SEEN. BUT THEY'RE

01:11:20.142 --> 01:11:21.410
CERTAINLY NOT A FACTOR- IS A

01:11:21.477 --> 01:11:26.482
RECOGNITION AND EFFORT TO MAKE.

01:11:26.548 --> 01:11:27.783
HEADWAY THERE. SO WE I'M- A IT'S

01:11:27.850 --> 01:11:29.551
KIND OF AN INCOME AT THE MOMENT

01:11:29.618 --> 01:11:30.285
THAT EVERYTHING IS STILL BEING

01:11:30.352 --> 01:11:34.823
FLESHED OUT. YEAH YEAH I THINK

01:11:34.890 --> 01:11:36.725
THIS IS A VERY COMPLEX PROBLEM

01:11:36.792 --> 01:11:38.293
AND THEY'RE SORT OF BUSINESS-

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:39.962
ADDRESS SOME ASPECTS OF THE

01:11:40.029 --> 01:11:40.996
STATE RESPONSE BUT CERTAINLY

01:11:41.063 --> 01:11:43.232
GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY- MORE

01:11:43.298 --> 01:11:45.167
RESOURCES AND TIME I'M AN EFFORT

01:11:45.234 --> 01:11:46.702
WILL SORT OF BE REALLY NECESSARY

01:11:46.769 --> 01:11:49.271

01:11:49.338 --> 01:11:49.838
CHALLENGES BEFORE THE STATE

01:11:49.905 --> 01:11:51.940
HERE. AND IF I MAY MR FONG I

01:11:52.007 --> 01:11:53.075
THINK THAT MIGHT BE A GOOD A

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:54.643
GOOD POINT OF REFERENCE TO PIVOT

01:11:54.710 --> 01:11:56.645
TO THE NEXT PANELS- ESPECIALLY

01:11:56.712 --> 01:11:58.047
CONSIDERING THE DATA QUESTIONS

01:11:58.113 --> 01:11:59.615
ABSOLUTELY AND I DO SO I ONE

01:11:59.682 --> 01:12:00.683
LAST QUESTION WHICH IS I AND I'M

01:12:00.749 --> 01:12:01.984

01:12:22.971 --> 01:12:24.873
PROPOSALS THAT ARE BEING FUNDED.

01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:27.042
BY OUT IT DO YOU FEEL THAT THERE

01:12:27.109 --> 01:12:28.277
IS COORDINATION OR DO YOU

01:12:28.343 --> 01:12:29.244
BELIEVE THAT THE MISSION IS

01:12:29.311 --> 01:12:31.580
JUST. THROWING YOU KNOW A BUNCH

01:12:31.647 --> 01:12:32.981
OF MONEY INTO AGAINST THE WALL

01:12:33.048 --> 01:12:34.650
AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. HOW TO

01:12:34.717 --> 01:12:36.285
DEAL WITH A BUNCH OF THINGS.

01:12:36.351 --> 01:12:38.687
INSTEAD OF. FINDING A MORE.

01:12:38.754 --> 01:12:42.624
COHESIVE WAY OF- ADDRESSING.

01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:47.262
WAY. AND I AND THAT WE MUST

01:12:47.329 --> 01:12:49.398
QUESTION. SO IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF

01:12:49.465 --> 01:12:51.066
THE SORT OF BROAD PORTFOLIO OF

01:12:51.133 --> 01:12:52.735
PROJECTS I'M SORRY OF A PROGRAM

01:12:52.801 --> 01:12:54.203
THAT HAVE BEEN FUNDED. I'M TO

01:12:54.269 --> 01:12:55.738
ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS IT SEEMS

01:12:55.804 --> 01:12:57.005
PRETTY CLEAR. US THAT ACTUALLY

01:12:57.072 --> 01:12:59.508
TWO MAIN PILLARS OF ACTION ONE

01:12:59.575 --> 01:13:01.443
IS INFRASTRUCTURE. DO YOU SEE

01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:03.312
THAT THROUGH ROOM KEY AND HOME

01:13:03.378 --> 01:13:04.980
KEY SO THAT PROVIDING RESOURCES

01:13:05.047 --> 01:13:06.515
TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THAT THEY

01:13:06.582 --> 01:13:08.717
CAN BUILD THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE-

01:13:08.784 --> 01:13:10.753
PORTFOLIO SO THAT THERE ARE

01:13:10.819 --> 01:13:12.721
OPTIONS TO BOTH YOUR SHORT TERM

01:15:27.122 --> 01:15:29.024
HAVE HAD MARGINAL SUCCESS

01:15:29.091 --> 01:15:31.493
BECAUSE WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS

01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:32.527

02:00:19.745 --> 02:00:20.947

02:05:43.002 --> 02:05:44.770
THINK YOU'RE REINFORCING THE

02:05:44.837 --> 02:05:47.373
IMPORTANCE OF HAVING A COUNTY

02:05:47.439 --> 02:05:50.743
LOCAL- COMMUNITIES TAKE MORE OF

02:05:50.809 --> 02:05:52.311
THE OWNERSHIP IN THE LEADERSHIP

02:05:52.378 --> 02:05:55.414
FOR- AND DETERMINING. WHAT THOSE

02:05:55.481 --> 02:05:56.916

02:06:12.398 --> 02:06:14.533
ACTUALLY AND THOSE EFFORTS ARE

02:06:14.600 --> 02:06:15.601
MOVING TO NEW ON SIX HI

02:06:15.668 --> 02:06:19.204
INDICATORS THAT- HELP US BETTER

02:06:19.271 --> 02:06:20.806
GAUGE AND THE OF IN THE- FOR

02:06:20.873 --> 02:06:22.308
EXAMPLE THAT ARE EXTRA HOME. AND

02:06:22.374 --> 02:06:25.511
INTO HOW. AND THE NUMBER OF IN

02:06:25.577 --> 02:06:27.346
THE- THAT ARE- NOT YOU KNOW RE

02:06:27.413 --> 02:06:29.148
ENTERING THE HOMELESSNESS SYSTEM

02:06:29.214 --> 02:06:31.884
FOR EXAMPLE. AND SO IN A JULIET

02:06:31.951 --> 02:06:34.753
IF YOU'D LIKE TO ADD ANY

02:06:34.820 --> 02:06:36.889
ADDITIONAL DETAILS. SO I WOULD

02:06:36.956 --> 02:06:38.724
AGREE WITH ONE THING THAT WILL

02:06:38.791 --> 02:06:40.225
FLAG AS I'M AWARE THAT THE LOCAL

02:06:40.292 --> 02:06:42.428
THE FEDERAL LAW PROVIDE IS TO

02:06:42.494 --> 02:06:44.897
FOLLOW OURS AND I WOULD- NOTHING

02:06:44.964 --> 02:06:46.231
I KNOW I DON'T WANT ANSWER THE

02:06:46.298 --> 02:06:47.266
QUESTION I DO THINK THAT THEY

02:06:47.333 --> 02:06:50.069
MIGHT BE. MORE APPROPRIATELY TO

02:06:50.135 --> 02:06:51.236

INDIVIDUAL AND SYSTEMS NEED I

02:06:53.539 --> 02:06:54.773
THINK THIS DOES FIND A COUPLE

02:06:54.840 --> 02:06:56.175
THINGS THAT WE OFTEN LIKE TO

02:06:56.241 --> 02:06:58.310
SHARE WHICH IS EVERY COMMUNITY

02:06:58.377 --> 02:06:59.812
IS GOING TO BE VERY DIFFERENT

02:06:59.878 --> 02:07:01.313
THAN THE WAY THE RESOURCES COME

02:07:01.380 --> 02:07:02.948
TOGETHER NEED TO SHOOT BUT THE

02:07:03.015 --> 02:07:04.350
PURPOSE AND NEED ABOUT

ABOUT- OTHER RESOURCES FOR

02:07:15.294 --> 02:07:16.095
EXAMPLE BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT

02:07:16.161 --> 02:07:21.133
THAT IS A LOCAL DECISION. TO BE

02:07:21.200 --> 02:07:22.101
MADE BY THOSE WHO ARE. THE

02:07:22.167 --> 02:07:22.901
DIRECTLY IN CHARGE OF THE

FRANKLY DID NOT HAVE AND THEY

02:18:16.521 --> 02:18:17.222
WERE NOT TIED TO THE SIX

02:18:17.288 --> 02:18:19.057
INDICATORS THESE WERE DOLLARS

02:18:19.124 --> 02:18:21.292
THAT WERE DISTRIBUTED. ACROSS

02:18:21.359 --> 02:18:24.462
THE STATE AND TO PROVIDE LOCAL

02:18:24.529 --> 02:18:27.599
COMMUNITIES THE GREATEST LEVEL

02:18:27.666 --> 02:18:32.370
FLEXIBILITY- STILL ASKS AND THE

HISTORICALLY HIGH LEVELS OF

02:18:37.075 --> 02:18:39.310
HOMELESSNESS DOLLARS. AND THAT

02:18:39.377 --> 02:18:41.813
THE FUNDING REQUIRES THAT

02:18:41.880 --> 02:18:43.782
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE GOING TO BE

02:18:43.848 --> 02:18:47.686
SEEN HAPPEN FUNDING- GO THROUGH

02:18:47.752 --> 02:18:50.689
A LOCAL- PLANNING PROCESS TO

02:18:50.755 --> 02:18:52.957
ESTABLISH LOCAL ACTION PLANS

02:18:53.024 --> 02:18:55.060
THAT ARE DUE TO THE STATE BY THE

02:18:55.126 --> 02:18:57.829
END OF JUNE OF THIS YEAR. AND

02:18:57.896 --> 02:19:00.098
THOSE LOCAL ACTION PLANS MUST

02:19:00.165 --> 02:19:03.401
DESCRIBE THE SIX INDICATORS AND

02:19:03.468 --> 02:19:03.902
THE GOALS THAT THEY'RE

02:19:03.968 --> 02:19:08.306
ESTABLISHING. AND HOW ALL THIS

02:19:08.373 --> 02:19:09.074
WILL BE UTILIZED. ONCE THOSE

02:19:09.140 --> 02:19:11.276
PLANS ARE SUBMITTED TO THE STATE

02:19:11.342 --> 02:19:14.245
OR TEAM WILL BE ASSESSING- THE

02:19:14.312 --> 02:19:18.016
PLANS OF ASSESSING AT THE- HOW

02:19:18.083 --> 02:19:20.351
REASONABLE THESE GOALS ARE. AND

02:19:20.418 --> 02:19:22.120
THEN ALSO USING THE DATA THAT WE

02:19:22.187 --> 02:19:24.189
HAVE- GATHERED AND COLLECTED IN

02:19:24.255 --> 02:19:25.924
AND FRANKLY AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:19:25.990 --> 02:19:28.993
I WOULD SAY THAT. WE ARE IN MANY

02:19:29.060 --> 02:19:30.762
WAYS OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS

02:19:30.829 --> 02:19:32.530
PLAYING SORT OF CATCH UP FOR

DEVELOPING INFRASTRUCTURES IN

02:19:34.699 --> 02:19:37.769
THE SYSTEMS. OUT TO ENSURE NOT

02:19:37.836 --> 02:19:38.770
ONLY THAT THERE'S GREATER

02:19:38.837 --> 02:19:40.739
COORDINATION BUT THAT WERE ALSO

02:19:40.805 --> 02:19:43.274
GATHERING THE DATA- THAT WILL

02:19:43.341 --> 02:19:45.376
HELP INFORM HOW DOLLARS ARE

02:19:45.443 --> 02:19:47.378

PROVIDE CONCRETE DATA IN TERMS

02:20:15.039 --> 02:20:17.408

WE ARE CURRENTLY MOVING THE

02:20:19.511 --> 02:20:21.880
SYSTEM TO ENSURE THAT BILL SIX

02:20:21.946 --> 02:20:23.581
INDICATORS BECOME THE WAY OF

02:20:23.648 --> 02:20:26.284
MEASURING- PERFORMANCE AT THE

02:20:26.351 --> 02:20:29.320
LOCAL LEVEL. BUT WE DO HAVE IN

DEMOGRAPHIC AND SURVEYS AND

02:23:20.024 --> 02:23:20.925
ABOUT THE SERVICE IS BEING

HAVE BEEN HOMELESS- SORT OF

02:23:32.403 --> 02:23:33.771
CAUSE AND EFFECT WHAT WHAT PUT

02:23:33.838 --> 02:23:34.839
THEM OUT THERE DO YOU ARE YOU

02:23:34.906 --> 02:23:36.874
SEEING. THE DEMOGRAPHICALLY WHAT

02:23:36.941 --> 02:23:38.743
TRENDS ARE YOU SAYING WITHIN

02:23:38.810 --> 02:23:40.611
THAT WITHIN THAT DATA SET. HELLO

02:23:40.678 --> 02:23:42.280
AND I'LL DISTINGUISH TWO THINGS

02:23:42.347 --> 02:23:44.349
SO AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND

02:23:44.415 --> 02:23:46.017
FUTURE RESTRICTION WILL COLLECT

02:23:46.084 --> 02:23:47.919
DATA ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT IS

02:23:47.986 --> 02:23:50.388
TRANSMITTED TO THE STATE- AND SO

02:23:50.455 --> 02:23:51.589
WITHOUT ANY JURISDICTION SAN

02:23:51.656 --> 02:23:53.157
FRANCISCO FOR EXAMPLE MAIN

02:23:53.224 --> 02:23:54.726
COLLECT MOVED FAR MORE ROBUST

02:23:54.792 --> 02:23:56.561
AND I'M I'M LIKE I'M SURE THEY-

02:23:56.627 --> 02:23:59.330
I WOULD GUESS THEY ARE- THAT WE

02:23:59.397 --> 02:24:00.999
DON'T HAVE TRANSMITTED TO US AND

02:24:01.065 --> 02:24:03.901
THAT'S- PARTIALLY- SO THAT WE

02:24:03.968 --> 02:24:04.936
CAN HAVE A STANDARDIZED SYSTEM

02:24:05.003 --> 02:24:06.137
ACROSS THE STATE AS YOU CAN

02:24:06.204 --> 02:24:07.905

SORT OF SPECIFIC DATA TO LOCAL

02:24:10.208 --> 02:24:13.978
JURISDICTION MY VERY ACROSS THE

02:24:14.045 --> 02:24:15.780
FORTY FOR CONTINUANCE OF CARE.

02:24:15.847 --> 02:24:18.416
WHAT WE ARE SEEING- IS SORT OF

02:24:18.483 --> 02:24:21.119
THAT THE TREND THAT I THINK THIS

02:24:21.185 --> 02:24:21.919
IS WELL IT'S SORT OF WELL

02:24:21.986 --> 02:24:23.154
DOCUMENTED AND ROUND WELL

02:24:23.221 --> 02:24:25.223
RECOGNIZED AROUND. THE RACIAL

02:24:25.289 --> 02:24:29.360
DISPARITIES AMONG- THOSE. RACIAL

02:24:29.427 --> 02:24:30.161
SUBGROUPS THAT ARE OVER

02:24:30.228 --> 02:24:31.229
REPRESENTED COMPARED TO THE

DATA DEMONSTRATED ANYWHERE

02:24:45.810 --> 02:24:50.381
WITHIN BAY PROGRESS. AND ONE OF

02:24:50.448 --> 02:24:51.883
THE THINGS THAT I THINK IS WHY

02:24:51.949 --> 02:24:53.451
WE ARE SO EAGER FOR THE SYSTEM

02:24:53.518 --> 02:24:55.153
PERFORMANCE MEASURES AS I THINK

02:24:55.219 --> 02:24:56.187
YOU KNOW AT THE DATA PERSON AND

02:24:56.254 --> 02:24:57.955
IN FORMALLY I WAS RESEARCHER

02:24:58.022 --> 02:25:00.258
SORT OF WHAT HOW DO WE DEFINE

02:25:00.324 --> 02:25:03.227
PROGRESS- IS WHAT WE ARE DEALING

02:25:03.294 --> 02:25:04.429
WITH NOW WHICH IS AROUND THE

02:25:04.495 --> 02:25:06.030
SYSTEM PERFORMANCE MEASURES SO

02:25:06.097 --> 02:25:08.066
WE ARE EAGER. TO GET THOSE OUT

02:25:08.132 --> 02:25:10.001
WE ARE EAGER TO TEND TO

COMMUNICATE THEM IN A VERY CLEAR

02:25:13.738 --> 02:25:15.306
WAY SO PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THEM.

02:25:15.373 --> 02:25:16.674
GOT A TOP OFFICER CRITTER THIS

02:25:16.741 --> 02:25:20.178
SO WITHOUT THE- DATA. WITHOUT

02:25:20.244 --> 02:25:22.313
BROAD AGREEMENT AS TO HOW WE CAN

02:25:22.380 --> 02:25:24.482

HOUSING FOR VULNERABLE

02:41:43.293 --> 02:41:45.829
NEIGHBORS. I BE AN ADEQUATE

02:41:45.896 --> 02:41:46.363
PROTECTIONS FOR VULNERABLE

02:41:46.430 --> 02:41:48.432
TENANTS. COURSE INSUFFICIENT

02:41:48.498 --> 02:41:49.866
INCOMES AND THE STRUCTURAL

02:41:49.933 --> 02:41:51.401
RACISM THAT CONTINUES TO

02:41:51.468 --> 02:41:53.437
PERMEATE ALL OF OUR SYSTEMS.

02:41:53.503 --> 02:41:55.038
THOSE FACTORS CERTAINLY PROCESS

02:41:55.105 --> 02:41:56.573
AND WE REALLY CAN'T TALK ABOUT

02:41:56.640 --> 02:42:01.178
HOMELESSNESS- WITHOUT TALKING

02:42:01.244 --> 02:42:01.745
ABOUT THOSE ELEMENTS. I JUST

02:42:01.812 --> 02:42:03.113
SUPPORT SOME NUMBERS TO IT FOR

02:42:03.180 --> 02:42:05.816
EVERY. ONE HUNDRED. LOW INCOME

02:42:05.882 --> 02:42:07.584
RENTER HOUSEHOLDS IN JUST IN

02:42:07.651 --> 02:42:10.153
CALIFORNIA. THERE ARE ONLY

02:42:10.220 --> 02:42:11.888
TWENTY FOUR AVAILABLE APARTMENTS

02:42:11.955 --> 02:42:12.989
OUT FOR THOSE HOUSEHOLDS THAT

02:42:13.056 --> 02:42:15.225
THEY CAN AFFORD SO THIS IS AGAIN

02:42:15.292 --> 02:42:16.159
LIKE A REALLY BAD GAME OF

02:42:16.226 --> 02:42:17.994
MUSICAL CHAIRS- THAT NOBODY

02:42:18.061 --> 02:42:19.463
SHOULD HAVE TO PLAY IT LEAVES

02:42:19.529 --> 02:42:21.198
OUR MOST VULNERABLE WITHOUT MANY

02:42:21.264 --> 02:42:23.700
OPTIONS. AS WELL AS LONG AS THAT

02:42:23.767 --> 02:42:25.001
IMBALANCE PROCESS WE'RE GOING TO

02:42:25.068 --> 02:42:26.870
HAVE TO CONTINUE TO SEE WHAT WE

02:42:26.937 --> 02:42:28.605
SEE IN PLACES LIKE LA WHERE

02:42:28.672 --> 02:42:30.774
PEOPLE BECOME HOMELESS AND FALL

02:42:30.841 --> 02:42:32.075
INTO HOMELESSNESS FASTER THAN WE

02:42:32.142 --> 02:42:34.945
CAN HOUSE THEM. IN LOS ANGELES-

02:42:35.011 --> 02:42:36.213
BASED ON OUR TWENTY TWENTY

02:42:36.279 --> 02:42:38.548
INFORMATION TWO HUNDRED AND FIVE

02:42:38.615 --> 02:42:40.083
PEOPLE EXITING HOMELESSNESS

02:42:40.150 --> 02:42:42.452
EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND TWO

02:42:42.519 --> 02:42:43.753
HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE PEOPLE

02:42:43.820 --> 02:42:45.222
FELL INTO HOMELESSNESS EVERY

02:42:45.288 --> 02:42:47.524
SINGLE DAY SO WE HAVE TO FIX

02:42:47.591 --> 02:42:52.863
THAT IMBALANCE AND TURN OFF THE. FAUCET OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:42:52.929 --> 02:42:53.930
FALLING AND- BUT DESPITE ALL THE

02:42:53.997 --> 02:42:55.265
REALITY ARE HOMELESS SERVICES IS

02:42:55.332 --> 02:42:56.867
DOWN OUR OUTREACH TEAMS OUR

02:42:56.933 --> 02:42:58.535
COMMUNITY PROVIDERS. HAVE BEEN

02:42:58.602 --> 02:43:00.637
ENORMOUSLY RESILIENT DURING THE

02:43:00.704 --> 02:43:02.372
CAN'T THAT MAC. AND WITH SUPPORT

02:43:02.439 --> 02:43:04.174
FROM THE STATE LOSS SAID THE

02:43:04.241 --> 02:43:06.443
CITY OF L. A. COUNTY FLA AND OUR

02:43:06.510 --> 02:43:08.512
COMMUNITY REALLY CAME TOGETHER

02:43:08.578 --> 02:43:09.913
TO SET A COLLECTIVE TARGET ON

02:43:09.980 --> 02:43:11.381
HOW DO WE GET AS MANY PEOPLE

02:43:11.448 --> 02:43:13.450
INSIDE IF POSSIBLE WHEN THE

02:43:13.517 --> 02:43:15.185
COVERED NINETEEN PANDEMIC CAT.

02:43:15.252 --> 02:43:16.853
AND IN A MATTER OF WEEKS OUR

02:43:16.920 --> 02:43:18.555
COLLECTIVE EFFORTS ALL COMING

02:43:18.622 --> 02:43:20.056
TOGETHER BROUGHT OVER THIRTY

02:43:20.123 --> 02:43:21.992
HOTELS AND MOTELS ONLINE YOUR

02:43:22.058 --> 02:43:24.261
PROJECT BRING KEY. AT ITS PEAK

02:43:24.327 --> 02:43:25.962
THERE WERE THIRTY SEVEN PRIVATE

02:43:26.029 --> 02:43:27.364
ROOM KEY SITES ACROSS THE LEE

02:43:27.430 --> 02:43:30.901
COUNTY REPRESENTING MORE THAN

02:43:30.967 --> 02:43:32.135
THIRTY SIX HUNDRED HOTEL ROOMS.

02:43:32.202 --> 02:43:36.139
AND THAT'S MORE THAN. ANY OTHER

02:43:36.206 --> 02:43:36.973
REGION IN THE COUNTRY. OKAY

02:43:37.040 --> 02:43:38.008
LEARNED A LOT FROM THE ROOM HE

02:43:38.074 --> 02:43:40.443
MÀ- MOST IMPORTANTLY IT'S THAT

02:43:40.510 --> 02:43:41.845
WHEN WE ALL COME TOGETHER FROM

02:43:41.912 --> 02:43:43.580
ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT

02:43:43.647 --> 02:43:46.183
GOVERNMENT AND PARTNERS. WE CAN

02:43:46.249 --> 02:43:46.983
MOVE FASTER THAN WE EVER THOUGHT

02:43:47.050 --> 02:43:49.319
WE COULD- WE RAN FOR IT ALSO

02:43:49.386 --> 02:43:50.954
REPORTS THAT WE NEED TO BUILD UP

02:43:51.021 --> 02:43:51.821
THE WAYS THAT WE'RE THINKING

02:43:51.888 --> 02:43:53.857
ABOUT SHELTER- VIETNAM

02:43:53.924 --> 02:43:55.859
CONGREGATE SPACES WHERE PEOPLE

02:43:55.926 --> 02:43:57.194
HAVE THEIR OWN ROOM THEY HAVE A

02:43:57.260 --> 02:43:59.329
DOOR THAT LOCKS THE BATHROOM. AT

02:43:59.396 --> 02:44:01.665
THAT DIGNITY AND PRIVACY HAS

02:44:01.731 --> 02:44:03.400
DEMONSTRATED AT LONG TERM

02:44:03.466 --> 02:44:04.768
OUTCOMES THAT ARE MUCH BETTER

02:44:04.834 --> 02:44:06.469
THAN WHAT WE SEE AND THE REST OF

02:44:06.536 --> 02:44:08.471
OUR PORTFOLIO. PEOPLE STAY

02:44:08.538 --> 02:44:10.040
LONGER AND THEY'RE MORE LIKELY

02:44:10.106 --> 02:44:12.075
TO MOVE INTO PERMANENT HOUSING-

02:44:12.142 --> 02:44:14.144
BUT ALSO NOT SURPRISINGLY PEOPLE

02:44:14.211 --> 02:44:16.246
WHO ARE MORE LIKELY TO ACCEPT

02:44:16.313 --> 02:44:18.481
THE SHELTER- BECAUSE A LOT OF

02:44:18.548 --> 02:44:20.050
TIMES FOLKS HAVE RESERVATIONS OR

02:44:20.116 --> 02:44:23.486
CONCERNS. ABOUT GOING TO

02:44:23.553 --> 02:44:24.387
CONGREGATE SETTINGS. SO DOING

02:44:24.454 --> 02:44:26.156
THAT OUT SINCE THE BEGINNING A

02:44:26.223 --> 02:44:27.490
PROJECT ROOM HE OVER TEN

02:44:27.557 --> 02:44:29.059
THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SERVED

02:44:29.125 --> 02:44:30.293
AT IN THOSE SITES JUST IN L. A.

02:44:30.360 --> 02:44:32.562
COUNTY. AND THE REAL SUCCESS TO

02:44:32.629 --> 02:44:35.398
ME IN FACT ARE OVER THREE

02:44:35.465 --> 02:44:36.399
THOUSAND OF THOSE PEOPLE HAVE

02:44:36.466 --> 02:44:38.368
MOVED FROM THE PROJECT BRING

02:44:38.435 --> 02:44:40.370
KEYSIGHT INTO PERMANENT HOUSING.

02:44:40.437 --> 02:44:41.871
AND LESS THAN 10% OF THEM ARE

02:44:41.938 --> 02:44:43.240
RETURNING TO THE STREET THESE

02:44:43.306 --> 02:44:46.776
NUMBERS REALLY FLOW AWAY WHAT WE

02:44:46.843 --> 02:44:47.844
SEE ACROSS THE REST OF THE

02:44:47.911 --> 02:44:49.045
SYSTEM- I'M REALLY CRITICAL

02:44:49.112 --> 02:44:50.080
COMPONENTS THAT IS THE HAVE.

02:44:50.146 --> 02:44:51.848
FUNDING FROM THE STATE EXPANDED

02:44:51.915 --> 02:44:53.583
AND SPECIAL INGREDIENT MAKING

02:44:53.650 --> 02:44:56.119
THIS WORK- WE HAVE YOU'D HAVE TO

02:44:56.186 --> 02:44:57.520
SUPPORT OUR HOMELESS PREVENTION

02:44:57.587 --> 02:44:59.589
PROGRAMS INCLUDING OUR PROBLEM

02:44:59.656 --> 02:45:01.491
SOLVING PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES

02:45:01.558 --> 02:45:02.926
COUNSELING AND FLEXIBLE

02:45:02.993 --> 02:45:04.728
ASSISTANCE TO PEOPLE IN CRISIS.

02:45:04.794 --> 02:45:06.930
WHO ARE NOT YET HOMELESS- ARE

02:45:06.997 --> 02:45:09.032
NOT YET FALL INTO HOMELESSNESS.

02:45:09.099 --> 02:45:10.500
BUT WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT FOR

02:45:10.567 --> 02:45:11.935
MANY PEOPLE WE COULD HAVE

02:45:12.002 --> 02:45:13.169
PREVENTED THEIR HOMELESSNESS

02:45:13.236 --> 02:45:14.704
WITH SOME SORT OF WELL TIME

02:45:14.771 --> 02:45:16.506
FLEXIBLE INTERVENTION UP FRONT

02:45:16.573 --> 02:45:19.743
AND THAT'S WHAT OUR PROBLEM

02:45:19.809 --> 02:45:20.677
SOLVING IS REALLY DEMONSTRATING

02:45:20.744 --> 02:45:21.945
. AND THEN FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DO

02:45:22.012 --> 02:45:23.346
FALL INTO HOMELESSNESS WE ALSO

02:45:23.413 --> 02:45:24.748
USE HAVE TO FUND INTERIM HOUSING

02:45:24.814 --> 02:45:26.216
INTERVENTIONS THAT BRING PEOPLE

02:45:26.283 --> 02:45:28.184
INSIDE FROM THE ELEMENTS. I'M

02:45:28.251 --> 02:45:29.352
CREATING A SAFE SPACE WHERE THEY

02:45:29.419 --> 02:45:31.054
CAN WORK WITH THE CASE MANAGER

02:45:31.121 --> 02:45:32.756
TO START PLANNING FOR

02:45:32.822 --> 02:45:34.724
TRANSITIONING INTO HOUSING. WE

02:45:34.791 --> 02:45:36.026
ALSO USE HALF FOR A RENTAL

02:45:36.092 --> 02:45:38.194
SUBSIDIES- AND AGAIN WE'VE BEEN

02:45:38.261 --> 02:45:39.896
ABLE TO DO ALL THIS BECAUSE OF

02:45:39.963 --> 02:45:41.331
THE FLEXIBILITY THAT HAPPENS

02:45:41.398 --> 02:45:43.667
AFFORDED TO US- AND GIVING US A

02:45:43.733 --> 02:45:44.968
RANGE OF INTERVENTIONS TO

02:45:45.035 --> 02:45:46.236
ADDRESS HOMELESS THAT'S BECAUSE

02:45:46.303 --> 02:45:47.671
YOU ALL HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING

02:45:47.737 --> 02:45:50.640
TODAY IT'S REALLY NOT ONE SIZE

02:45:50.707 --> 02:45:52.575
FITS ALL. LOOKING FORWARD WE DO

02:45:52.642 --> 02:45:54.344
NEED TO DO MORE AND AS THESE

02:45:54.411 --> 02:45:55.879
COMMITTEES WORK TOWARDS CRAFTING

02:45:55.945 --> 02:45:58.048
A BUDGET FOR TWENTY TO TWENTY

02:45:58.114 --> 02:45:59.549
THREE AND BUILDING ON A STARK

02:45:59.616 --> 02:46:00.717
INVESTMENT IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET

02:46:00.784 --> 02:46:02.118
THERE ARE COUPLE OF CORE

02:46:02.185 --> 02:46:03.687
PRINCIPLES THE BEATING COURAGE

02:46:03.753 --> 02:46:06.489
YOU ALSO KEEP AT THE FRONT OF

02:46:06.556 --> 02:46:08.425
THE CONVERSATIONS. THE FIRST IS

02:46:08.491 --> 02:46:10.760
THE NEED FOR ONGOING FUNDING.

02:46:10.827 --> 02:46:11.494
FOR THE BILLION DOLLAR

02:46:11.561 --> 02:46:13.763
INVESTMENT IN THAT THE STUDY CAP

02:46:13.830 --> 02:46:15.398
BOTH IN THE CURRENT BUDGET YEAR

02:46:15.465 --> 02:46:17.400
AND NEXT YEAR IS SO VITAL IN

02:46:17.467 --> 02:46:18.902
ENSURING WE HAVE THE RESOURCES

02:46:18.968 --> 02:46:20.503
WE NEED TO MOVE PEOPLE OFF THE

02:46:20.570 --> 02:46:23.273
STREET- AND HELP. CREATE THAT

02:46:23.340 --> 02:46:24.541
LONG TERM PLANNING THAT NEEDS TO

02:46:24.607 --> 02:46:27.577
HAPPEN AROUND STOPPING UP CASE

02:46:27.644 --> 02:46:29.245
MANAGEMENT SHELTER BEDS. THE

02:46:29.312 --> 02:46:31.281
CONSISTENCY IS REALLY KEY AND WE

02:46:31.348 --> 02:46:33.016
NEED THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE

02:46:33.083 --> 02:46:34.584
AT TO PRIORITIZE MAKING THE

02:46:34.651 --> 02:46:35.919
FUNDING PERMANENT SO WE CAN

02:46:35.985 --> 02:46:37.554
ENSURE OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE

02:46:37.620 --> 02:46:39.923
NOT PROFIT. I HAVE THAT ABILITY

02:46:39.989 --> 02:46:43.226
AND STABILITY SO THEY CAN SCALE

02:46:43.293 --> 02:46:44.928
UP THEIR ORGANIZATIONS. AT THE

02:46:44.994 --> 02:46:46.296
STATE ALSO BEGAN EXACTING

02:46:46.363 --> 02:46:47.697
FLEXIBLE DOLLARS FOR LOCAL

02:46:47.764 --> 02:46:50.333
PROVIDERS IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN

02:46:50.400 --> 02:46:52.369
NINETEEN BUDGET YEAR- BUT HAS

02:46:52.435 --> 02:46:54.237
CHANGED THE PROGRAM SINCE THEN-

02:46:54.304 --> 02:46:56.606
BUT THAT WAS A PROMISING PROGRAM

02:46:56.673 --> 02:46:57.874
SO JUST PUTTING IT IN ANOTHER

02:46:57.941 --> 02:47:00.176
CONTACT. WE WOULD NEVER EXPECT

02:47:00.243 --> 02:47:01.911
THE FACT IT PICKS ASK FOR MARK

02:47:01.978 --> 02:47:03.346
EIGHT THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS IF

02:47:03.413 --> 02:47:04.381
THEY HAD TO GO TO SACRAMENTO

02:47:04.447 --> 02:47:06.116
EACH YEAR TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE

02:47:06.182 --> 02:47:07.517
THE NEEDED FUNDING TO CONTINUE

02:47:07.584 --> 02:47:09.519
THEIR SCHOOLING PROGRAMS. AND

02:47:09.586 --> 02:47:11.187
EXPECTING IT OF THE HOMELESSNESS

02:47:11.254 --> 02:47:15.091
RESPONSE SYSTEM DOESN'T MAKE

02:47:15.158 --> 02:47:15.792
SENSE- IN THE SAME CONTACTS.

02:47:15.859 --> 02:47:17.060
ANOTHER PIECE THAT I WANT TO

02:47:17.127 --> 02:47:19.129
EMPHASIZE INCENTIVES POLICIES

02:47:19.195 --> 02:47:20.430
AND PROGRAMS DESIGNED THAT

02:47:20.497 --> 02:47:21.398
REALLY ENCOURAGED LOCAL

02:47:21.464 --> 02:47:23.400
JURISDICTIONS TO INVEST IN

02:47:23.466 --> 02:47:25.435
BALANCE HOMELESS SYSTEMS. HERE

02:47:25.502 --> 02:47:27.237
AT LOS THE EVERY YEAR WE CAN

02:47:27.303 --> 02:47:29.506
DOCTOR WE CALL A SYSTEM ANALYSIS

02:47:29.572 --> 02:47:30.907
AND IT DETERMINES WHERE ARE THE

02:47:30.974 --> 02:47:32.809
GREATEST NEEDS IN OUR SYSTEM

02:47:32.876 --> 02:47:33.777
RELATIVE TO THE POPULATION THAT

02:47:33.843 --> 02:47:35.812
WE HAVE. AND THE ONE THING WE

02:47:35.879 --> 02:47:37.680
FIND YEAR OVER YEAR IS THAT THE

02:47:37.747 --> 02:47:40.316
IDEAL RATIO FOR OUR SYSTEM IS

02:47:40.383 --> 02:47:42.152
THAT WE HAVE FIVE PERMANENT

02:47:42.218 --> 02:47:44.053
HOUSING INTERVENTIONS FOR

02:47:44.120 --> 02:47:45.822
EVERYONE IN A ROOM HOUSING BAD.

02:47:45.889 --> 02:47:47.657
WITHOUT THAT WE FIND PEOPLE

02:47:47.724 --> 02:47:49.759
MOVING INTO INTERIM OR TEMPORARY

02:47:49.826 --> 02:47:51.828
OPTIONS STAYING THERE FOR A LONG

02:47:51.895 --> 02:47:54.364
TIME WITH NO EXIT PATHWAY AND NO

02:47:54.431 --> 02:47:58.768
OPTIONS TO GO TO. SO ADDED MORE

02:47:58.835 --> 02:48:00.637
WE GET THE FLOW. AND WE CAN

02:48:00.703 --> 02:48:02.372
ACTUALLY SERVE MORE PEOPLE IN

02:48:02.439 --> 02:48:04.274
THOSE INTERNED HOUSING BAD. BACK

02:48:04.340 --> 02:48:05.942
RATIO IT LOOKS A LITTLE BIT

02:48:06.009 --> 02:48:06.943
DIFFERENT IN EACH COMMUNITY BUT

02:48:07.010 --> 02:48:08.645
WE SHOULD CERTAINLY CONTINUE TO

02:48:08.711 --> 02:48:10.346
MAKE SURE EVERY COMMUNITY IS

02:48:10.413 --> 02:48:12.415
USING A DATA CENTRIC APPROACH.

02:48:12.482 --> 02:48:13.516
TO DETERMINE THAT RIGHT RAISE

02:48:13.583 --> 02:48:17.921
THE L. AS. THE HOUSING RESOURCES

02:48:17.987 --> 02:48:18.988

02:48:20.557 --> 02:48:22.392
IT IF THE STATE DOES FUND THEM

02:48:22.459 --> 02:48:24.294
AXIAL STATEWIDE. INCLUDES RENTAL

02:48:39.943 --> 02:48:40.910
FIERCE COMPETITION IN THE

02:48:40.977 --> 02:48:41.845
HOUSING MARKET FOR WHAT UNITS

02:48:41.911 --> 02:48:43.613

02:48:43.680 --> 02:48:45.148
RECOMMENDED STATE INVESTMENT

THROUGH THAT PROCESS. WE ALSO

02:48:59.929 --> 02:49:01.431
RECOMMEND THE STATE TO CONTINUE

02:49:01.498 --> 02:49:03.099
INVESTMENT IN HOUSING UNIT

02:49:03.166 --> 02:49:05.468
ACQUISITION STRATEGIES SO THIS

02:49:05.535 --> 02:49:07.036

CAMP HAD BEEN THERE FOR A LONG

02:56:01.350 --> 02:56:03.619
TIME. HAD GROWN LARGE OR THE

02:56:03.686 --> 02:56:04.720
POPULATION WAS EXTREMELY

02:56:04.787 --> 02:56:05.888

WERE VERY THAT WE HADN'T SEEN

02:56:15.598 --> 02:56:17.967
AND INSERT THE- USUAL PRACTICE.

02:56:18.034 --> 02:56:19.936
SO WE ARE ELEVATING THAT SCALING

02:56:20.002 --> 02:56:21.637

SUSTAINING THAT TYPE OF TOUCH

02:56:31.747 --> 02:56:33.115

02:56:50.032 --> 02:56:50.866
TRADITIONAL HOUSING SIDE OF THE

02:56:50.933 --> 02:56:53.269
STATE. I'M THE SECOND THING WE

02:56:53.336 --> 02:56:54.470
AS OTHER COMMUNITIES ARE DOING

02:56:54.537 --> 02:56:56.005
IS TRYING TO FIND NEW YOU WITH

02:56:56.072 --> 02:56:57.306
NEW AND UNIQUE WAYS TO SHELTER

02:56:57.373 --> 02:56:59.709
PEOPLE. AS I SAID HERE KAY WAS A

02:56:59.775 --> 02:57:02.778
GREAT- A LESSON LARNED FOR US

02:57:02.845 --> 02:57:04.780
ABOUT HOW TO- APPROACH CHILDREN

02:57:04.847 --> 02:57:06.415
DIFFERENTLY BUT IT WAS.

02:57:06.482 --> 02:57:08.284
EXPENSIVE AND PROBABLY NOT

02:57:08.351 --> 02:57:10.653
SUSTAINABLE AT THAT LEVEL AND SO

02:57:10.720 --> 02:57:16.158
THEN THE THINGS THAT WE'RE.

02:57:16.225 --> 02:57:17.026
LOOKING AT IS STANDING UP WHAT

02:57:17.093 --> 02:57:17.860
WE'RE CALLING STATE STAY

02:57:17.927 --> 02:57:18.861
COMMUNITY SOME CAN. CALLED SAFE%

02:57:18.928 --> 02:57:19.628
GROUNDS ARE SO. ENCAMPMENTS USE

02:57:19.695 --> 02:57:21.430
POWER HOMES OTHER TO OF TIME

02:57:21.497 --> 02:57:22.064
HOME. TO PROVIDE THAT SENSE OF

02:57:22.131 --> 02:57:25.067
SAFETY SECURITY- AND DIGNITY TO

02:57:25.134 --> 02:57:26.168
FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN LIVING

02:57:26.235 --> 02:57:28.637
OUTSIDE FOR A LONG TIME. I'M AS

02:57:28.704 --> 02:57:29.905
WITH EVERYTHING THOSE TYPES OF

02:57:29.972 --> 02:57:32.008
INVESTMENTS- TAKE BOTH AT ONE

02:57:32.074 --> 02:57:33.409
TIME CAPITAL BUT IN ONGOING

02:57:33.476 --> 02:57:35.311
OPERATING. SO AS WE LOOK TO

02:57:35.378 --> 02:57:37.913
STATE FUNDING MOVING FORWARD AND

02:57:37.980 --> 02:57:40.816
AS HE SAID ANYTHING- ANYTHING IS

02:57:40.883 --> 02:57:42.151
HELPFUL THAT WE KNOW IS

02:57:42.218 --> 02:57:43.919
PREDICTABLE. SO I'M GOING ON

02:57:43.986 --> 02:57:45.921
CONSISTENT MONEY IS ALWAYS UP TO

02:57:45.988 --> 02:57:47.656
PORT. AND THE FINAL THING I WANT

02:57:47.723 --> 02:57:49.025
TO SAY BECAUSE I THINK IT'S THAT

02:57:49.091 --> 02:57:50.359
IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT AND WITH

02:57:50.426 --> 02:57:52.128
AS WE KNOW THAT THE ONLY. REAL

02:57:52.194 --> 02:57:53.629
SOLUTION TO ALL OUR WORK IS

02:57:53.696 --> 02:57:55.531
HOUSING AND CERTAINLY-

02:57:55.598 --> 02:57:57.266
SUPPORTING THE HARD WORK H. TWO

02:57:57.333 --> 02:57:58.734
D. AND OTHERS TO BUILD MORE

02:57:58.801 --> 02:58:00.970
HOUSING IS CRITICAL. BUT JUST AS

02:58:01.037 --> 02:58:03.172
IMPORTANT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO-

02:58:03.239 --> 02:58:04.940
CREATE MORE ACCESS TO OUR

02:58:05.007 --> 02:58:07.076
CLIENTS IN THE OPEN MARKET. AND

02:58:07.143 --> 02:58:09.845
ONE OF THE AT IT WE HAD WITH THE

02:58:09.912 --> 02:58:12.148
FIRST ROUND OF THE HAP- WE WERE

02:58:12.214 --> 02:58:13.849
ABLE TO LAUNCH A VERY SMALL WE

02:58:13.916 --> 02:58:15.618
HOUSING PILOT. BUT IT'S VERY

02:58:15.684 --> 02:58:17.053
HARD TO SUSTAIN WITH ONE TIME

02:58:17.119 --> 02:58:18.721
DOLLARS BECAUSE OFTEN THE RENTAL

02:58:18.788 --> 02:58:20.389
NEEDS OF THESE CLIENTS LAST FOR.

02:58:20.456 --> 02:58:21.657
FOR MANY YEARS AND CERTAINLY THE

02:58:21.724 --> 02:58:23.192
CASE MANAGEMENT NEEDS LAST FOR

02:58:23.259 --> 02:58:25.728
MANY MANY YEARS- OUR BOARD JUST

02:58:25.795 --> 02:58:27.563

02:58:30.666 --> 02:58:31.867
THREE YEARS. OF TEN MILLION

02:58:31.934 --> 02:58:34.403
DOLLARS. TO SCALE THIS BACK UP

02:58:34.470 --> 02:58:35.938
AND HOPEFULLY PROVE THE EFFICACY

02:58:36.005 --> 02:58:38.074
BUT AGAIN YOU KNOW ECHOING

02:58:38.140 --> 02:58:39.208
FRIDAY A LITTLE BIT THAT WOULD

02:58:39.275 --> 02:58:40.943
BE. AN AMAZING INVESTMENT FOR

02:58:41.010 --> 02:58:42.511
THE STATE TO MAKE TO HAVE. A

02:58:42.578 --> 02:58:44.346

02:58:44.413 --> 02:58:47.116
SUPPORT LOCAL RENTAL- PROGRAMS

02:58:47.183 --> 02:58:48.984
