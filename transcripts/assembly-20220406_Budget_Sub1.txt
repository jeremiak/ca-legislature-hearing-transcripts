WE HAVE RECEIVED A POLICY ALIGNMENT REPORT FROM THE STATE I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO PERSONALLY THANK DIRECTOR KIM JOHNSON AND HER STAFF AT THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES FOR PROVIDING THIS.

TRAUMA INFORMED AND STRENGTHS BASED PROGRAM. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY HERE TO ADVANCE A MAJOR GOAL IN THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH IN EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT AND MATERNAL HEALTH AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN SEIZE THE- SEIZE IT BY PAVING THE WAY TOWARDS MODEST TRAILER. BILL CHANGES IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TO BUDGET SUCH AS THE REMOVAL OF THE COUNTY SHARE OF WORK PARTICIPATION RATE OR W. P. R. PENALTY. THE COUNTY SHARE OF THE PENALTY HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLY INHIBITING ELEMENT IMPEDING THE WORK INTO WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY INVESTED SO MUCH TIME EFFORT AND GOOD WILL. I AM VERY HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO BUILD A BETTER PROGRAM HERE TOGETHER MUCH LIKE WE HAVE DONE WITHIN THE MEDICAL SPACE WITH CAL HM AND WITH THE FIFTY BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE BOLD GOALS. WE'LL ALSO HEAR ABOUT AND TALKED TDAY ABOUT MAJOR% AUTOMATION PROJECTS IN HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA STATEWIDE AUTOMATED WELFARE SERVICES SINGLE SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT CAL SAUCE AND OUR CHILD WELFARE SERVICES CASE MANAGEMENT PROJECTS ONE OF WHICH IS A LEGACY SYSTEM AND ANOTHER IS A DEVELOPING REPLACEMENT SYSTEM.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- KIM JOHNSON CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND APPRECIATE THE OPENING REMARKS AND SHARED ACROSS IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON TOGETHER TO STRENGTHEN OUR CALYX PROGRAM. SO I WILL JUMP RIGHT INTO THE QUESTIONS- IN THE AGENDA AND APPRECIATE THE BACKGROUND THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED AND SO YOU'RE GOING TO HERE SHORTLY A LITTLE MORE DETAIL ABOUT THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE COW WORKS POLICY ALIGNMENT REPORT. I WITH BY CHRISTINA MAYES THAT WHO WILL FOLLOW ME BUT I WILL JUST GENERALLY SAY THAT THE TWENTY TWO RECOMMENDATIONS FALL GENERALLY WITHIN A FOR AREAS NOT IS ACCESS TO THE CAR WORKS INCLUDING. OUT REACH AN UNDERSTANDING OF THOSE WHO NEEDED ME TO NOTE NEWLY ENROLLED IN THE PROGRAM AS WELL AS ACCESS TO THE SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AND BENEFITS ONCE AN INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY IS ENROLLED INTO THE PROGRAM. AT THE EXPERIENCE OF THE PARTICIPANT WHETHER IT'S A SINGLE CASE WORKER HAVING THAT NAVIGATOR OR THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR POLICY SETTING AND PROGRAM DESIGN PROCESS SEES. AT COUNTY STAFF THE RELATIONSHIP IN THE INTERACTIONS- IN THE SUPPORT AND TRAINING THAT THEY NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL INCLUDING HOW OVER TIME THE WORK PARTICIPATION RATE HAS INFLUENCED THE WAYS IN WHICH WE ARE ENGAGING WITH THE COW WORKS PARTICIPANT. AND FINALLY CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT WHETHER THAT BE VIA PEER LEARNING. PARTICIPATE INPUT SESSIONS OR MORE IN SO THAT'S THOSE ARE VERY BROADLY AGAIN YOU'LL HEAR MORE DETAIL JUSTICE JUST A MOMENT AND I WOULD SAY THAT EACH OF THESE AREAS AND THESE RECOMMENDATIONS FIT WITHIN THE CAL OR- OR THE COW WORKS OUTCOMES ACCOUNTABILITY IN REVIEW CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK. THE FRAMEWORK WAS DESIGNED OVER TWO YEARS AGO BY CURRENT AND FORMER CAL WORKS PARTICIPANTS IN CLIENTS ADVOCATES COUNTY STAFF LEGISLATIVE STAFF AS WELL AS A VARIETY OF OTHER SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS AND I'D NOTE. THAT ON YOUR AGENDA IN IN THIS PANEL YOU'LL HAVE A COUPLE OF MEMBERS OF THAT WORK GROUP AT PARTICIPATING. THIS FRAMEWORK IDENTIFIES SHORT TERM MEDIUM TERM AND LONG TERM OUTCOMES THAT ALL BEST REPRESENT CALIFORNIA'S PROGRAM DESIGNED. AND SO SOME OF THE- THAT COME. IN THOSE OUTCOMES THAT WE ARE STRIVING TO ACHIEVE INCLUDE ENSURING THAT CHILDREN AND FAMILIES BASIC NEEDS ARE MET. INCREASE PARTICIPATION PARTICIPANT SATISFACTION WITH THE PROGRAM IMPROVED WELL BEING IMPROVED GOAL ACHIEVEMENT. INCREASED EMPLOYMENT AND WAGES. REDUCE NEED FOR INCOME SUPPORTS IN REDUCED INTER GENERATIONAL POVERTY. THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE ALSO REFLECTIVE OF THE WAYS TO FURTHER THE COW WORKS TO PLANO. A. C. W. D. A. LED EFFORT TO HELP COUNTY STAFF BETTER ENGAGE FAMILIES IN THE PROGRAM IN A STRENGTH BASED AS YOU MENTIONED. COLLABORATIVE IN TRAUMA INFORMED CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE WAY. AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS PROVIDE A NUMBER OF STRATEGIES FOR CONSIDERATION AS WE LAUNCH INTO THIS FIRST ROUND F. CAL OR- THE DEPARTMENT LOOKS FORWARD TO FURTHER CONVERSATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND PARTNERS TO BETTER INFORM THE FEASIBILITY OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS RESPECTIVE TO THEIR IMPLEMENTATION AND FURTHER. LEARN THROUGH THE CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS OF CALOR. AS IT RELATES TO YOUR SECOND QUESTION AROUND KEY CHALLENGES FOR THE CALYXT CASELOAD AND IT EMPHASIS ON THE CHILDREN LIVING IN DEEP POVERTY IN THE PROGRAM I WANT TO FIRST AND FOREMOST ACKNOWLEDGE THE WORK THAT CALIFORNIA HAS DONE. TO ENSURE THAT OUR POLICIES IN THE TOWN OF PROGRAM STRENGTHENS SUPPORT FOR CHILDREN INCLUDING PROVIDING AID TO CHILDREN TO AGE EIGHTEEN. AND CONTINUING TO PROVIDE AID. PARENTS PORTION OF IT IS ENDED AS A RESULT THE SHARE OF CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN IN POVERTY WHO RECEIVED JANET BENEFITS HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN MUCH HIGHER. THAN THE SHARE IN OTHER STATES IN THE NATION. WITH THAT SAID THERE'S STILL MORE WORK TO DO TO DISRUPT AND ULTIMATELY END CHILD POVERTY IN OUR STATE. SOME OF OUR RECENT INVESTMENTS AND STRENGTHEN EFFORTS ADDRESS TO A DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THESE KEY CHALLENGES FOR CALYX PARTICIPANTS NOT JUST NAME A FEW ONE HOME VISITING. A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM AIMING TO SUPPORT POSITIVE HEALTH DEVELOPMENT AND WELL BEING OUTCOMES FOR PREGNANT PARENTING PEOPLE FAMILIES IN INFANTS BORN INTO POVERTY EXPANDING THE FUTURE EDUCATIONAL ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL OPPORTUNITIES AND IMPROVING THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THEY WILL ACCEPT READY. WE CONTINUE WORKING WITH ALL PARTNERS ON THIS EFFORT AND IT REALLY IS ABOUT THE STRENGTH BASED APPROACH CONNECTING FAMILIES TO RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THEM ALONG THE WAY. I ALSO WOULD NOTE THE COW WORKS HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM WHICH IS INTENDED TO FOSTER HOUSING STABILITY FOR FAMILIES EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN THE CALYX PROGRAM. WHICH WE TO SPOKEN TO THIS COMMITTEE ABOUT PREVIOUSLY BUT HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED IN THE BUDGET ACT APPROPRIATING TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS PROGRAM. I'D ALSO NOTE ACCESS TO CHILD CARE SUBSIDIES ANOTHER PLACE WHERE WE HAVE INVESTED TOGETHER FOR EXPANDED ACCESS WHETHER IT BE IN THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM OR FOR THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAMS THAT THOSE. FAMILIES MAY BE ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN FAMILY STABILIZATION A PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES THAT MAY BE IN IT IN ADDITION TO THOSE PROVIDED BY THE COUNTY'S WELFARE TO WORK PROGRAM. TO CLIENTS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING IDENTIFIED SITUATION OR CRISIS AND FINALLY I'D SAY THE OTHER AT STRATEGY THAT WE CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN IS HOW WE ARE SUPPORTING ACCESS TO THE FULL SAFETY NET ARRAY. AND SO WE HAVE RECENTLY LAUNCHED AGAIN WE SPOKEN AT PREVIOUSLY TO THE STATEWIDE OUTREACH ADVISORY ROUND TABLE THAT'S BEEN NEWLY CREATED OR STORE. LAUNCHING IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR IN THE GOAL OF THAT EFFORT IS TO INFORM OUR OUTREACH EFFORTS TO PERSPECTIVE CAO WORKS FAMILY FAMILIES LEVERAGING DATA AND EXISTING RESOURCES. WE ALSO HAVE BEEN USING A NUMBER OF STRATEGIES TO AGAIN MAKE THAT CONNECTION SO WHETHER IT'S THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT WHETHER IT WAS COVERED RELIEF THAT WAS AVAILABLE. I WE ARE LOOKING TO HAVE TAX FILING SUPPORT ALL OF THE CONNECTION POINTS FOR CAL WORKS FAMILIES TO GET CONNECTED TO ECONOMIC SUPPORTS AN EDITOR. AT SUPPORT THAT MAY SUPPORT THEIR STABILITY. THE NEXT QUESTION HE ASKED HOW THE COW OR- A COLOR CREATES ACCOUNTABILITY AND IMPROVED PROGRAM OUTCOMES. AND YOU WORK AND WPR PENALTIES HELP OR HINDER. AT THE WORK BEING UNDERTAKEN CALOR SITE JUST VERY QUICKLY THE CAL OR AT PER INITIATIVE CONSISTS OF THREE CORE COMPONENTS PERFORMANCE INDICATORS A CAP PATCHWORK SELF ASSESSMENT COUNTY SELF ASSESSMENT. AND A SYSTEM IMPROVEMENT PLAN. AND I'LL JUST NOTE THAT ARE POOR PERFORMANCE INDICATORS THAT WERE DESIGNED AGAIN TOGETHER IN THAT WORK GROUP INCLUDE PARTICIPATING GAUGE MINT SERVICE DELIVERY EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT. PROGRAM EXITS AND RE ENTRIES PARTICIPATION BARRIER REMOVAL FAMILY AND CHILD WELL BEING. AND TO THE QUESTION AT IN THIS AREA EMPLOYMENT. WHEN MEASURES. ARE LOOKING AT THE EMPLOYMENT RATE OF CURRENT POWER EXPERTISE DEPENDS THOSE WERE PARTICIPATING IN SUBSIDIZED EMPLOYMENT AS WELL AS THE EMPLOYMENT RATES POST CAL WORKS. SO AGAIN THAT INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE IN A WAY THAT SUPPORTS OUR ABILITY TO FREEPORT ON THE FEDERAL MEASURES AT TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND AGAIN THE INITIATIVE IS DESIGNED IN A WAY THAT IT'S A LOCAL DATA DRIVEN PROGRAM MANAGEMENT SYSTEM TO FACILITATE THAT CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT AND DISSEMINATE BEST PRACTICE AND ALLOW AS AT THE STATE LEVEL TO LOOK AT. WHAT DOES THAT WORKING BEST SO IT IS TRUE THAT TODAY AT STATE TENNIS PROGRAMS AGAIN THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENT MUST MEET A FEDERAL WORK PARTICIPATION RATE TO AVOID FISCAL PENALTIES. THE WORK PARTICIPATION RATE IS THE CINGULAR BINARY METRIC USED TO MEASURE STATE SUCCESS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. WE RECOGNIZE TOGETHER THE FLAWS EMBEDDED IN JUST HAVING THIS METRIC ALONG WITH THE GOAL OF APPLYING MORE MEANINGFUL METRICS OF SUCCESS TO THAT CAL OR EFFORT THAT WE JUST SPOKE TO. AND SO AGAIN WE WOULD RECOGNIZE THAT WORK IN EMPLOYMENT R. ONE COMPONENTS OF MANY THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF THE SUCCESS OF CAL WORKS. YOU ALSO ASK THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN CAL WORKS THE CHILD WELL FIRST COUNCIL VISION AND GOALS AND- AT THE STATE SCHOOLS AROUND BREAKING TO GENERATIONAL POVERTY CHILD DEVELOPMENT GREATER EQUITY. SO HERE I WOULD JUST POINT OUT TO THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES STRATEGIC PRIORITY WHICH IS FOCUSED ON IMPROVING OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN LIVING IN EXTREME POVERTY AND FOSTER CARE IN JUVENILE JUSTICE AND- BY ADDRESSING. ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES. EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION NEEDS AND IMPROVING ACCESS TO PHYSICAL HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES. I'LL ALSO POINT TO ANOTHER GUIDING PRINCIPLE I REFERENCED EARLIER TO THIS COMMITTEE WHICH IS AROUND EQUITY. AND JUST SIMPLY PUT TO IN OUR GUIDING PRINCIPLES IN ORDER TO CREATE THE STATE WERE ALL OF US CAN HAVE A CHANCE TO THRIVE BASED ON OUR EFFORTS AND HARD WORK WE CANNOT. WE CANNOT ALLOW. CERTAIN GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS TO BE DISADVANTAGED BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN THE GENDER IDENTITY OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION AGE. OR DISABILITY. AND SO AGAIN WE ARE LOOKING AT DISRUPTING POVERTY BY PROVIDING STRENGTH BASED SERVICES AND RESOURCES THAT TANGIBLY ADDRESS THE ANY INEQUALITIES. THE COW WORKS CAL OR COMPONENT THAT I JUST REVIEWED THAT FRAMEWORK IS REALLY THE WAYS IN WHICH WE ARE DOING THAT IN THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM ALONG WITH MANY INVESTMENTS THAT WE RECENTLY. AT ENACTED TOGETHER INVESTED IN TOGETHER TO STRENGTHEN THE PROGRAM. OF COURSE AS IT RELATES TO ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES THE WORK OF THIS CALIFORNIA'S FIRST SURGEON GENERAL AND- AT OUR SECONDS AT COMING ON HERE TO REDUCE ACES AND REALLY ENSURE THAT THIS TRAINING AND SUPPORT. FOR NOT ONLY HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS BUT MORE BROADLY ACROSS THE SERVICE SYSTEM. AROUND WHAT TWO ACES ARE HOW TO IDENTIFY THEM AND OF COURSE HOW TO. CREATE THE TRUMP INFORM NETWORKS OF CARE TO SUPPORT. THOSE WHO ARE IMPACTED SO TOGETHER. AGAIN WITH THE CHILD WELFARE COUNCIL SPEAKING JUST A SECOND TO YOUR SECOND QUESTION AROUND THE CHILD WELFARE AT COUNCIL SCHOOLS. WE ARE TOGETHER LOOKING HOLISTICALLY. AT HAD NO MATTER WHAT PROGRAM WHAT FUNDING STREAM WHAT SOURCE HOW WE ARE SUPPORTING ADDRESSING THAT CHILD POVERTY. OR GREATLY ACROSS THE BOARD. YOU SPOKE AT IN YOUR OPENING REMARKS HERE AND HAVE A QUESTION HERE AROUND HOW AT THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. SERVICES AGENCY- INSURES THAT INITIATIVES LIKE THE BOLD GOAL OF FIFTY BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND IN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. AT CONNECT. IN SUPPORT PROGRAMS LIKE HOW ITWORKS AND- WHAT I WOULD JUST AGAIN SAY IS THAT- THAT SECRETARIES OFTEN TALKING ABOUT OUR WORK IN AB TESTING SILENCE. THAT WE HAVE TO AND AGAIN IT'S REFLECTED IN OUR FRAMEWORK AT IN OUR STRATEGIC PRIORITIES. I THINK ABOUT A WHOLE PERSON INFORMED PROCESSES THAT WE ARE LOOKING. AT TOGETHER COLLECTIVELY IN RECOGNITION THAT WE ARE SERVING THE SAME CHILD AND FAMILY IN SO MANY CASES ACROSS THESE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES AND SO. HOW THESE COMPONENTS AND HOW THESE GOALS AND OUTCOMES FIT TOGETHER IS CRITICAL. THE HOUSING NEEDS THE CASH ASSISTANCE NEEDS THE MENTAL AND BEHAVIOR HEALTH SUPPORTS AND SO AGAIN- WE ARE VERY COMMITTED AND CONTINUE TO NOT ONLY HAVE. TABLE SET WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER JOINTLY IN TERMS OF WORKING TO ADDRESS THESE AREAS WITH ACROSS DEPARTMENTS. BUT ALSO WE ARE SITTING TABLES FOR JUST ASK THE DEPARTMENTS TO REALLY DIG INTO SOME OF THAT DETAILED WORK FOR WE ARE IDENTIFYING. ANY BARRIERS WE HAVE TO FULLY INTEGRATING. OUR SERVICES- I ALSO GO AGAIN THAT- IT BETTER INITIATIVE THAT'S VERY SIMILAR IN THAT SAME GOAL FRAMEWORK IN THAT SAME OBJECTIVE IS THE CHILDREN TO BE HEALTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE AND WELL OVER FOUR BILLION DOLLARS THAT AGAIN THAT WE'VE INVESTED TOGETHER IN THE SPACE BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE. AT IT CRITICAL NEED AND AGAIN A PLACE THAT WE ARE WORKING TOGETHER AND IDENTIFYING THE LEVERAGE THAT WE HAVE ACROSS PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT THAT. AND FINALLY AGAIN I MENTIONED AT TROUBLE FOR COUNCIL GO BACK TO THE FINAL QUESTION HERE IN IS THE NEAR TERM GOALS OF THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY IN THE CHILD WELFARE COUNCIL TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF CHILDREN LIVING IN DEEP POVERTY. AND SO I'VE MENTIONED THAT A LITTLE BIT ON THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SIDE IN IN THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING AND CAL WORKS. OUT BUT I WOULD JUST NOTE AS IT RELATES TO CHILD WELFARE COUNCIL ARE CO CHAIRS HAVE RECENTLY- IDENTIFIED THAT THE THEME OF OUR NEXT WORK TOGETHER AND THAT'S ABOUT KEEPING FAMILIES TOGETHER. AND SO HOW ARE THESE SUPPORTS ACROSS THE BOARD THAT WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS KEEPING FAMILIES TOGETHER WE CANNOT DO MEANINGFUL PREVENTION WORK WITHOUT ADDRESSING EQUITY. GIVEN THE DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF BLACK AFRICAN AMERICAN FAMILIES IN NATIVE AMERICAN FAMILIES TO ENTER INTO AND STAY FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME INTO THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. WITH RESPECT TO REUNIFICATION OF PERMANENCY. THAT WE HAVE TO THE WORK WILL LIKELY NEEDED YOU CONSIDER APPROPRIATE SUPPORTS FOR RELATIVES. AND FAIRLY DIVERSE THAT OPPOSED TO MEET ME AT THE KITCHEN SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. SINCE MOST FAMILIES AT- INVOLVED IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM WOULD BE CLASSIFIED AS POOR MANY COMING FROM ENERGY GENERATIONAL POVERTY. SO AGAIN WE ARE LOOKING TO THAT WOULD REALLY IDENTIFY SOME OF THE STRUCTURAL ISSUES STRUCTURAL RACISM AND OTHERS AT IN TERMS OF GETTING AHEAD IN OUR PREVENTIVE SPACE. TO SUPPORT FAMILIES TOGETHER. AND I JUST ALSO ADD THAT IN TERMS OF ADDITIONAL SHORT TERM GOALS I WANT TO AGAIN I CAN'T UNDERSCORE ENOUGH. THE GOVERNOR IN THIS BODY THE LEGISLATURE'S AT LEADERSHIP IN IN THE UNPRECEDENTED AND HISTORIC INVESTMENTS THAT WE'VE HAD- IN OUR PROGRAMS TO REALLY ADDRESS THE SCHOOL AND REALLY LOOKING AT DISRUPTING POVERTY AND- AT THAT NUMBER IF FAMILY MEAN IF. POLICIES THAT WE'VE AND- IN JUST THIS CURRENT YEAR- I THAT PARTICULAR POLICY AREAS WERE WE REFORMED CAL WORKS EIGHT TO PREGNANT PARENTS AND ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE SUPPORT EARLIER ON. THE WORK WE'VE DONE FOR APPLE CAN INCOME DISREGARD. SPEAKING TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THIS REPORT EVEN AND THAT IN INVESTMENTS WE'VE MADE COUNTY STAFF TRAINING. ON RACIAL EQUITY IN IMPLICIT BIAS TO ENSURE THAT THEY CAN DO THE BEST JOB IN THOSE INTERACTIONS WITH CLIENTS- AND MANY MANY MORE- VERY SHORT TERM IT'S THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL I CAN SPEAK TO AGAIN. AT IN TERMS OF WHAT OUR GOALS ARE NOT IS. CONTINUING OUR WORK ON ASUS EXTENT EXTENDING PROVIDER TRAINING. OUR WORK SPACE OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE A PROPOSAL IN FRONT OF YOU. THAT SUGGESTING WE INCREASE THE MAXIMUM A PAYMENT BY SEVEN POINT OCTOBER ONE- WE ALSO HAVE ITEMS LIKE PROPOSING A REFUNDABLE ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR TAX CREDIT FOR YOUNG ADULTS AGE EIGHTEEN. THROUGH TWENTY FIVE WHO ARE FORMALLY FOSTER YOUTH. ABBOTT MANY MANY OTHERS IN TURN THE CHILD CARE SUBSIDY ACCESS AND- WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE PRIVILEGE TO IMPLEMENT OUT THAT MANY OF THESE INITIATIVES AND WE ARE DOING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THOSE WHO WE ARE. HERE AND PRIVILEGE TO SERVE IN AGAIN APPRECIATE. ARE THE QUESTIONS HERE ON THE AGENDA THIS AFTERNOON. THANK YOU DIRECTOR.

AND AS A REMINDER OF HOW OR JUST RE LAUNCHED IN JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AFTER ONE YEAR POTS DURING THE PANDEMIC AND THROUGH THIS PAUSE AND DO THIS RELAUNCH WE REESTABLISH THE CYCLE UP FOR THIS IF YOU SEE KAY WHY PROCESS FOR THREE YEARS TO BUY YEARS I WITH THE KERN CYCLE IN THE IN. TWENTY TWENTY SIX. IN ADDITION TO THE HAPPENING WITHIN HOW LORD ARE OTHER RECOMMENDED WITHIN THE REPORT THAT COHEN WITH SOME OF OUR EXIT UPPER. AND WORK IN IN RIGHT NOW WITH INCOME WORKS TO SERVE OUR FAMILIES- AND OUR OUR COUNTY PARTNERS SUCH AS THAT STATE BY TRAINING. LAST YEAR WE SAW ON INVESTMENT TO LAUNCH STATEWIDE RACIAL EQUITY IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING. AT THE DEPARTMENT IS ON TARGET TO RELEASED A FORMAL PLAN TO THE LEGISLATURE IN DECEMBER OF THIS YEAR. THAT DETAILS THE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY FOR THAT TRAINING. THE DEPARTMENT IS ALSO PLANNING A VERY ROBUST STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESS THIS SUMMER AT TO HELP INFORM THAT FINAL PLAN WHERE WE CAN LEVERAGE OPPORTUNITIES. TO INFORM A BROADER STATEWIDE TREAT EFFORTS HAPPENING IN OTHER AREAS ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT. LASTLY WHAT TO HIRE THAT- CALIFORNIA'S. IN NATIONAL WORKGROUPS A PART OVER AT EACH STAGE. I TO IN THE THING BUT TENET MODERNIZE FOR. AND AS A MORE FOR. WITH THE SPACE YOU WILL SOME INHERENT A- I. A RELAY JOHNSON IN THE WORK THAT WE'RE WITH THAT COW. IT JUST TO I GO SIX OR- THAT THIS WAY WE HAVE PART OF THE KIND OF MODERNIZE THE WORKER. A RECORD. THAT THE TO MAINTAIN OUT DIRECTLY INCLUDE AS A CLEAR NORTH STAR READING EACH THE PRINCIPLES AND AS THE FUNDING FOR BUILDING MODERN KIND OF PROGRAM. TO SUPPORT AGAINST THE CHILD AND FAMILY WELL BEING IDENTIFIED INCLUDE PRIORITISATION OF HELPING FAMILIES ACHIEVE ECONOMIC MOBILITY TO THE SUPPORT. OF PHYSICAL SOCIAL EMOTIONAL WELL BEING FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY. AGAIN THIS TIES IN VERY CLOSELY TO THE OUTREACH WORK THAT YOU HEARD DIRECTOR JOHNSON RATES UP AROUND CONNECTING OUR FAMILIES. TO CRITICAL TAX BENEFITS ATC OUTRAGE THAT WE WERE ABLE TO LAUNCH A VERBAL CAL WORKS AND HOW FRESH RECIPIENTS. AS WELL AS RECENTLY LAUNCHED A GOLDEN BEAR PASSED SEPARATE WITH- CAL WORKS FAMILIES WHERE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO I DO TARGETED OUTREACH OUR COLORS FAMILIES TO GIVE THEM ACCESS TO THE FREE GOLDEN BEAR PASSED. RESULTING IN APPROXIMATELY FIFTY EIGHT HUNDRED PASSES BEING DISPERSED IN JUST THE FIRST THREE WEEKS OF OUTREACH WHICH IS ALMOST DOUBLE. THIS DISBURSING. HOW WORKS FAMILIES LAST YEAR. THE SECOND CORPORATE PRIORITIES THE OF TAILORED SOLUTION THAT HELP FAMILIES. WITH THEIR INDEPENDENT SUCCESS FOR THE LONG TERM. AT THE THIRTEENTH FOSTERING CONDITIONS THAT ADVANCE A PERSON SINCE THE AGENCY OVER THE LIFE AND BELONGING WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITY. OF COURSE MEANS ENTERING POLICIES AND EVIDENCE AND PROMISING PRACTICES THAT REFLECT THE LIVED EXPERIENCE OF FAMILY. IT IS WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE BROADER WORKFORCE SYSTEMS WERE AT FORTY NEEDED CONTINUE BUT SERVICES THAT SUPPORT ALL OF OUR JOB SEEKERS STRINGS THE GOALS AND THEN FINALLY- A SIX OR PRINCIPLE SUPPORTING ACCESS TO AN ADEQUATE ASSISTANCE AND SERVICES THAT ALLOW FAMILIES TO MEET BASIC NEEDS WHILE WORKING TO ACHIEVE THEIR LONG TERM GOALS. AGAIN MANY OF THESE PRINCIPLES ALIGNING WITH SOME OF THE WORK THAT'S HAPPENING WITHIN CAO WORKS IN THE INVESTMENTS MADE A THROUGH THE PROPOSED BUDGET. IT CAN MUCH ALSO IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING WE THINK HOW WORKS TO PLANO AND OF COURSE THE WORK THAT WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO. AT THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM KATHY CENTRELINE MCDONALD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRTH CATHARINE MCDONNELL WITH THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION WE WERE REALLY PLEASED TO SEE THE SUBCOMMITTEE RETURNING TO THIS ISSUE AND DISCUSSING THE WAYS IN WHICH ALL OF THE SYSTEMS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT FOR THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS ARE INTERCONNECTED. MY MEMBERS HAVE A STRONG SENSE OF URGENCY IN ADDRESSING THE INTERSECTION OF THE POVERTY HOMELESSNESS AND CHILD AND FAMILY WELL BEING WE KNOW THAT FAMILIES DON'T JUST EXIST IN ONE SPHERE OR HAVE NEED TO ANSWERING SOMEONE ARAFAT BUT YOU THINK SPERRY ITS GREAT SUCCESS A GREAT CHALLENGES. ACROSS ALL ASPECTS OF THEIR LIVES- I WOULD LIKE TO TALK BIT ABOUT THE IMPORT OF CAN. TO FURTHER FOR THE WORK I'VE CAL WORK AND CAL WORKS CHU POINT NO SO MANY BEHAVIOR HEALTH ISSUES FOR LATER CONCERNS THAT WE'VE SEEN- ALWAYS BUT CERTAINLY. AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC AND THIS CAN BE REALLY OVERWHELMING TO FAMILIES. IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER WAITING TO REALLY INSTALL THE CAL WORKS TO PLAY NOW AND CAL WAR. PRINCIPLE AND THE IDEAS BEHIND THESE EFFORTS TO REALLY ENGAGE WITH OUR CLIENTS TO MEET THEM WHERE THEY ARE. IT'S AN IMPORTANT THING TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN BE GOAL ORIENTED AND LYFT COMPLIANCE ORIENTED WITH THE FAMILIES THAT WE WORK WITH AND REALLY ENGAGE WITH THEM AND MAKE THAT CONNECTION. SO THAT WE CAN HOPE TO. ADDRESS NOT JUST THE ISSUES THAT THEY HAVE BROUGHT THEM IN THE DOOR I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY FOR EXAMPLE AND CAL WORKS I NEED TO BE ABLE TO PAY THE BILLS. I NEED TO HAVE FOOD ON THE TABLE FOR MY FAMILY BUT TO ALSO FIND OUT WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON IN THEIR LIVES AND HELP THEM GET THE KINDS OF SERVICES THAT WE CAN OFFER THROUGH THESE PROGRAMS IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO STRENGTHEN THE FAMILY. AND MOVE FORWARD. INTO THE WORK FORCE BACK INTO THE WORKFORCE ARE INTO PROGRAM THAT MIGHT MAKE THE MOST SENSE WHILE THEY'RE ALSO ABLE TO GET SERVICES AND SUPPORTS REPEATED ISSUE OTHER ISSUES. THAT THE FAMILIES. ARE EXPERIENCING. THINKING ABOUT THE REPORTS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY- SUCH AS POWER OF LINE UP. THE BUDGET THAT ARE WORK THAT I THAT TOUCHED LITTLE COVER IT IF YOU. BOTH OF THESE ARE FOR REALLY HIGHLIGHTED TO CONTINUE REFORMING CAL WORKS IN THE DIRECTION OF TO POINT OUT. AND THE FULLY AND SUPPORT AND EMBRACE THE PRINCIPLE THAT- FRANKLY DIRECTOR JOHNSON AND- ASSISTANT DIRECTOR MAKES THAT WE'RE TALKINGABOUT. INCLUSION EQUITY AND BUILDING ON THE STRENGTHS OF FAMILIES TO SUPPORT THEM AND MOVING FORWARD. WE THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO DO THAT IN BIG WAYS THAT POSITIVELY IMPACT CLIENTS. FUNDING SERVICES AND SUPPORTS AND GIVING THEM OPPORTUNITIES AND LIKE I SAID MAKING THAT HE COULD GAUGE MAY CONNECTION WITH FAMILIES. IT ALSO TAKES A DEEP CULTURE SEX TO FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE PROGRAM. I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT THERE ABOUT THAT WORK PARTICIPATION RIGHT. HISTORICALLY W. P. R. HAS BEEN THE SOLE FOCUS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IN PARTICULAR AS THE ONLY MEASURE AND THAT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME DRIVER OF POLICY AND PRACTICE. THERE'S A REAL RECOGNITION ACROSS THE ENTIRE COUNTRY THE W. P. R. ISN'T THE BEST MEASURE AND SHOULDN'T BE THE ONLY MEASURE AND THIS IS A- BIPARTISAN. THAT THE KERN IT JUST HAS NOT YET LED TO. THAT THE LEVEL. BUT HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE TAKEN THE STEPS. MEANT TO POINT OUT TO- ENACTED NOW BEGIN GETTING BACK TO IMPLEMENTING CAL OR WHAT YOU'RE REALLY CLOSE THAT OUR EFFORTS TO MOVE AWAY FROM THIS APPROACH FOR CALIFORNIA. OUT DESPITE THE RECENT EFFORTS THOUGH THE PENALTY LANGUAGE THAT YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR COMMENTS- OPENING THAT THE HEARING TODAY. HAS REALLY SLOWED OUR EFFORTS AND REMAINS A BARRIER. TO FURTHER. HELLO OR IS AN EFFORT TO MEASURE. TO TAKE A 36 DEGREES LOOK AT GIVEN A SET. WITH ARE FOR. ARE SOCIAL SIR CAR THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY THE INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES THAT WE SERVE WHO HAD EXPERIENCE OF THE PROGRAM. LOOK AT MEASURES AND DATA AND HOW WE'RE DOING ON MULTIPLE MEASURES AND THEN DEVELOP IMPROVEMENT PLANS. IT'S THAT ARE CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT APPROACH. MOVING AWAY FROM A PENALTY OR COME. COMPLIANCE BASED APPROACH WITH THE COUNTIES IN THE SAME WAY WE ARE TRYING TO CHANGE THAT PENALTY BASED. COMPLIANCE BASED APPROACH WITH OUR OWN CUSTOMERS THAN THE FAMILIES THAT WE SERVE. BUT WHAT THE PENALTY IS HANGING OUT THERE IT DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO REALLY GO ALL IN ON THESE OTHER MEASURES AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. THOSE AND THESE APPROACH THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR LONG TERM NATURE WHY ARE. AND THE W. P. R. IS THE SHORT TERM WATER OFF KIND OF MEASURE. AND IT'S THE THING THAT CAN GET THE COUNTY PENALIZED IT CREATES A REAL CATCH TWENTY TWO. FOR COUNTIES FOR INDIVIDUAL WORKERS FOR SUPERVISORS AND MANAGERS AND HOW THEY TALK WITH STAFF. ABOUT IMPLEMENTING THESE CHIU REALLY DICHOTOMOUS THINGS AT THE SAME TIME. SO WE CAN THINK THE PENALTY PASSED THROUGH LANGUAGE BEING A- WILL NOT MAKE COUNTIES LEFT ACCOUNTABLE IN FACT IT WILL HELP COUNTY SPEAK. YOU KNOW WITH A UNIFIED VOICE WITH OUR OTHER WITH OUR CUSTOMERS WITH OUR STAFF AND BE ABLE TO I THINK REALLY. AREN'T EMBRACE TO POINT OUT HOW OR IN A WAY THAT THEY'VE PERHAPS NOT FULLY BEEN ABLE TO WIN THAT LANGUAGES. OUT THERE. WAS ALSO TO GIVE THE PERSON FROM POLICY OF MINE REPORTED CERTAINLY HAVE MORE ACCURATE. I'M SURE IT'S ABOUT BUT- REALLY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THINK TO THE ABOUT- SOME OF THE THAT. PIECES OF THAT REPORT- HAVE REALLY ALSO BEEN EXACERBATED BY THE PANDEMIC- IT'S IMPORTANT TO FACTOR THAT IN I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOLUTIONS SUCH AS THAT FOR EXAMPLE- RE ENGAGEMENT OF OUR CUSTOMERS WHO MADE FOR NOW. I TWO YEARS NOT HAVE REALLY BEEN ENGAGED EITHER OR WITH THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM WITH THE WORK FORCE OR WITH THE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT WE OFFER. BECAUSE THOSE HAVE BEEN LOCKED DOWN THEMSELVES. WHAT THESE ARE. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IS GOING TO MOVE THE PROGRAM CLOSER TO THAT VISION OF TWO POINT NOW IN THE LONGER TERM. AND WHAT IS GOING THE MOST DIRECTLY HELP PROTECT. I DO WANT TO ALSO COMMENDED THE DEPARTMENT FOR THE APPROACH THAT TOOK I MEAN YOU SEE A LOT IN THERE AND THERE'S A LOT TO BE CONSIDERED. THE APPROACH THAT'S NOTED THAT- IN THE HEARING AGENDA OF HAVING THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE JUST THE WORK AROUND- KIND OF WHAT SAID THAT REPORT AND WHAT NEXT STEPS MIGHT BE WITH A LOT OF THAT BECAUSE IT IS A LITTLE BIT AT- SEEMS LIKE A REALLY. GOOD SET UP NEXT TO ME. IN A LONGER TERM I THINK- OF SOMETHING WE'D ALSO EMPHASIZED IS TO REALLY REMEMBER THAT COUNTIES DO HAVE FLEXIBILITY. BECAUSE OF THE TYPES OF POPULATIONS WE SERVE THE INDUSTRIES THAT MAYBE WITHIN THE COUNTY OF THE NEEDS THAT ARE PARTICULAR IN ATLANTIC COUNTY AND SO ENABLING FLEXIBILITY TO CONTINUE. AND NOT HAVING IT BE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL PROGRAM ACROSS FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IT'S. IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN. AND THEN- FINAL JUST THINKING ABOUT THE INNER. BETWEEN CHILD WELFARE. AND POVERTY CAL WERE. EVERYTHING THAT I RECKON THANK YOU AS YOU BOTH LOOK TOWARD POSSIBLE HERE DURING THIS BUDGET AS WELL AS A LONGER TERM CONVERSATION FOR US ALL- WE CERTAINLY KNOW THAT THERE'S INTERSECTION BETWEEN POVERTY AND THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM NOT THAT POVERTY CLASSES OF HOUSTON THAT COLLECT BUT THAT POVERTY CAUSES SIGNIFICANT STRESS ON FAMILIES. THAT CAN AT TIMES BRING THEM TO THE ATTENTION OF CHILD WELFARE. AT TIMES BECAUSE OF ABUSE OR NEGLECT THAT IS OCCURRING BUT ALSO BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT THEM EVEN IF THERE'S NOT SOMETHING GOING ON THAT'S RIGHT INTO THAT LEVEL OF ABUSE OR NEGLECT. FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN HELP STRENGTHEN FAMILIES SO THEY NEVER BECOME TO THE ATTENTION OF THE SYSTEM OR GET INTO THE SYSTEM IS REALLY CRITICAL YOU KNOW- IN THIS CURRENT YEAR WE HAVE FUNDING FOR A VERY LARGE PREVENTION EFFORTS. THAT YOU SUPPORTED MISTER CHAIR AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE THIS PAST YEAR THAT HAS YET TO GET UNDERWAY BUT WERE LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND DEPARTMENT. AS WELL AS THE EIGHTY PLUS ORGANIZATIONS THAT HELPED YOU SUPPORT AND MAKE IT HAPPEN THIS IS A DEFINITE. REALLY GET INTO. TO TALK THAT DOES PER. SAID IN EQUITIES THAT WE SPEAK AND HOW WE CAN STRENGTHEN FAMILIES. AND KEEP THEM OUT OF THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM BY NOT JUST PROVIDING- I'D BE USED TO COLLECT BUT PREVENTING EVEN THAT FIRST CALL. BECAUSE THAT'S THE PLAN WE WILL BE STRONGER THE COMMUNITY WILL HAVE SERVICES IN PLACE. M. THEN- AWAY TO HELP STRENGTHEN THAT. WE ALSO NEED TO BETTER SUPPORT FAMILIES CHILDREN AND CAREGIVERS WHO ARE SYSTEM INVOLVED- FOR EXAMPLE WE KNOW THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT CAL WORKS IN CHILD WELFARE OVERLAP. BETWEEN THE TWO PROGRAMS WE ARE LAST YEAR- PROPOSED AND WERE REALLY GRATEFUL TO HAVE APPROVED- THE ABILITY TO CONTINUE CAL WORKS PAYMENTS TO FAMILIES. WHEN THEY'RE SPEAKING TO REUNIFY WITH CHILDREN WHO HAVE BEEN BROUGHT INTO FOSTER CARE. THERE'S ALSO A SIGNIFICANT EFFORT UNDER WAY TO REALLY REVITALIZED AND REVAMPED OUR LINKAGES PROJECT WILL CALLING IT LIKE IT JUST TO POINT OUT. AND THAT REALLY- IS A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN OUR CAL WORKS IN OUR CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM LOCALLY. TO IDENTIFY AND BETTER SERVICE COORDINATOR SERVICES AND SUPPORTS FOR FAMILIES INVOLVED IN BOTH SYSTEMS. THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF DISCUSSIONS THE PAST HEARINGS ABOUT OTHER WAYS TO SUPPORT TRANSITION AGE YOUTH. CARE GIVERS THAT RELATIVE CARE GIVERS AS WELL SO I WON'T GO INTO THAT IN THE INTEREST OF TIME BUT- I THINK YOU KNOW THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS OUT THERE THAT. ARE PRETTY CRITICAL TO HELPING ALL OF THESE FAMILIES AND WE KNOW THAT MANY OF OUR CARE GIVERS ESPECIALLY RELATIVES ARE THEMSELVES LIVING IN POVERTY. THE THINKING ABOUT WAYS TO SUPPORT THEM THAT'S REALLY CRITICAL. AND THEN FINALLY I'LL JUST SHARE THAT- SUPPORTING AND STRENGTHENING OUR OWN WORKFORCE IS REALLY CRITICAL AS WELL. THERE'S THERE AND- I EFFORT THIS YEAR TO REALLY LOOK I THINK ACROSS A NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL AS WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION. ON HOW WE CAN ENHANCE OUR WORKFORCE WE HAVE OUR OWN PROPOSAL TO WTA ALONG WITH AN S. W. S. I. U. AND THAT AFTER MASTERS OF SOCIAL WORK FOR. BUT WE DON'T ALSO A ROOM- TRAINING FOR COUNTY STAFF JUST. OF DISPROPORTIONATELY ACT. AND INCLUDED ISSUE. BUT ALSO JOB TO THAT THEY- FEEL. I TRIED AND P. T. GET THAT WE KNOW THAT WE ARE SEEING A OUR- JUST AS OTHER WORK. THAT ARE THE- AND ALL HOW TO ENTER TOM INFORMED. TO DO THEIR OWN WORK WITH FAMILIES ESPECIALLY GIVEN WHAT ALL OF US HAVE EXPERIENCED OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. WITHOUT ALL WRAPPED UP AND AS YOU KNOW I'M AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU GET INTO DISCUSSION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM AS HE HOOKED FULLER MASK FINANCE IF I CAN TO CREATE A LITTLE SPACE FOR. THEM AS WELL AS MY CARROLL- THAT'S RIGHT. THANK YOU. I CAN HEAR IT. WONDERFUL HI GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR A MINUTE IF YOU CUT FULL- THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET AND POLICY CENTER AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK TODAY. I WANT TO START BY STRESSING THAT ALL CALIFORNIA FAMILIES WANT THE ABILITY TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. KEEP A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS AND HELP THEIR CHILDREN THRIVE. FAMILIES ALSO NEED SUPPORT TO DEAL WITH THE MYRIAD STRESSORS OF POVERTY. RACE AND GENDER DISCRIMINATION IN THE LABOR MARKET AND OTHER BARRIERS TO HEALTH AND ECONOMIC SECURITY. YES UNDER THE FEDERAL CANNOT PROGRAM STATES CAN BE PENALIZED FOR HELPING PARENTS WITH THESE BARRIERS INSTEAD OF JUST PUSHING THEM INTO PAID EMPLOYMENT. AND CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT PLANNED TO PASS ANY POTENTIAL PENALTY ONTO THE COUNTY'S. MAKES IT HARDER TO WORK WITH FAMILIES WITH LOW INCOMES AND TO OFFER THEM THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED. WE KNOW THAT EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS ARE TRAUMA INFORMED. RECOGNIZE A FAMILY CIRCUMSTANCES AND FOCUS ON FAMILY STRENGTH. OVER THE YEARS THE COMMERCE PROGRAM HAS RIGHTLY CHANGE TO BETTER REFLECT THESE PRINCIPLES AND THAT WORK SHOULD BE CONTINUED. STATE LEADERS MUST COMMIT TO HELPING PARENTS ADDRESS BARRIERS AND THAT MEANS REMOVING OR REVISING THE PENALTY PASS ON SO THAT IT NO LONGER DISCOURAGES FULLY PROVIDING THE CRITICAL COUNSELING AND EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES THAT PARENTS NEED PARENTS FACE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND ADVERSE EXPERIENCES THAT NEGATIVELY AFFECT THEIR EMPLOYMENT PROSPECTS IN THEIR HEALTH. IT ALMOST FOUR IN TEN CAL WORKS CASES THE HEAD OF THE HOUSEHOLD DID NOT COMPLETE HIGH SCHOOL. ADDITIONALLY ON AVERAGE AT LEAST HAVING MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES ABUSE- AND 5% HAVE STRUGGLED WITH SUBSTANCE USE AND THIS DATA REFLECTS NATIONAL RESEARCH THAT MOST TEN OF RECIPIENTS HAVE AT LEAST ONE BEAR TO WORK AND MANY HAVE MULTIPLE BARRIERS. AND ALSO THE LIKELIHOOD OF WORK TO CLIENTS AS THE NUMBER OF BARRIERS INCREASES. AND YET COUNTER INTUITIVELY THE FEDERAL KIND OF PROGRAM AND ITS REQUIREMENTS FOR STATES FOCUSES ONLY ON GETTING PARENTS INTO JOBS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND NOT ON HELPINGTHEM ADDRESS LONGER TERM BARRIERS TO WORK. THIS SHORT SIGHTED WORK FIRST MENTALITY IS REFLECTED IN THE WORK PARTICIPATION RATE OR WPR- AS OTHERS SPEAKERS HAVE ALREADY NOTED BEFORE ME. BUT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT TODAY IS THAT WPR IS NOT JUST A FLAWED MEASURE BUT THAT IT IS SPECIFICALLY- A FEDERALLY DEFINED A NARROW SET OF WELFARE TO WORK ACTIVITIES. DESPITE THE RESEARCH THAT SHOWS THAT PARENTS NEED BOTH EMPLOYMENT FOCUSED ACTIVITIES AND OF THOSE SUPPORTING EDUCATION AND TREATMENT. SUCH SUPPORT OF ACTIVITIES DO NOT FULLY COUNT TOWARDS THE WPR. IN RECENT YEARS CALIFORNIA POLICY MAKERS HAVE TAKEN THE INITIATIVE TO MOVE AWAY FROM THIS WORK FORCED MODEL AND INSTEAD TO FOLLOW THE RESEARCH ON HOW TO ADVANCE FAMILY WILL BEGINNING. THESE STEPS INCLUDE SB TEN FORTY ONE IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WHICH CREATED NEW STATE STANDARDS UNDER WHICH BARRIER REMOVAL ACTIVITIES AND EDUCATION ARE ACTUALLY EQUAL TO WORK ACTIVITIES. THOUGH IN THE SHORT TERM CALIFORNIA COULD RISK A PENALTY FOR NOT MEETING TARGET WORK RATES. THESE MORE HOLISTIC STANDARDS ARE BETTER FOR FAMILIES AND COULD ACTUALLY HELP INCREASE THE STATE'S WORK RATES IN THE LONG TERM. UNFORTUNATELY THE STATE'S LONGSTANDING POLICY- TO MAKE COMPANIES PAY HALF OF ANY POTENTIAL PENALTY HINDERS THIS PROGRESS. THE CALIFORNIA HAS NEVER ACTUALLY GET PAID UPON A PENALTY THE PENALTY SHARING PROVISION EFFECTIVELY DISCOURAGES COUNTIES FROM FULLY IMPLEMENTING THE STATE'S OWN POWERS REFORMS. AND HAS REAL ON THE GROUND CONSEQUENCES FOR OUR FAMILIES. ARANDA VALUATION OF THE RECENT- POLICY CHANGES HAVE SHOWN THAT COUNTY CASE WORKERS PERCEIVE AN INHERENT CONFLICT BETWEEN HOLISTICALLY SUPPORTING PARENTS ON THE ONE HAND. AND MEETING THE V. PR IN THE OTHER BECAUSE CASE WORKERS CAN BE PENALIZED WHEN THE PARENTS THEY SUPPORT DO NOT MEET THESE TYPE WORK AT THESE WORK TARGET. AS A RESULT OF SOME CASE WORKERS REPORTED ACTUALLY FEELING LIKE WE NEEDED TO STEER CLIENTS AWAY FROM ACTIVITIES LIKE TREATMENT TREATMENT AND EDUCATION BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT MEET W. P. R. THE STATE CAN AND SHOULD MOVE ON FROM THIS UNSUSTAINABLE STATUS QUO. ONE OPTION IS TO REMOVE THE PENALTY SHARING POLICY ENTIRELY SO THAT CASE WORKERS CAN INSTEAD FOCUS ON HELPING PARENTS REMOVE BARRIERS TO WORK AND SUPPORTING THEIR GOALS. ANOTHER OPTION WOULD BE TO SHIELD COUNTIES FROM POTENTIAL PENALTIES ARE PROVIDED THEY WOULD HAVE MEANT WPR TARGETS IF BARRIER REMOVAL ACTIVITIES ACTUALLY FULLY COUNTED AND CALCULATING THE WORK RATE. BUT BEYOND REVISING THE W. P. R. POLICY OF THE STATE SHOULD FOCUS ON STRENGTHENING OUR OVERALL SO THAT FAX IS DEFINED AS HELPING PARENTS MOVE. OUT OF POVERTY AND TOWARDS MEETING THEIR PERSONAL GOALS. AT THE STATE LEADERS SHOULD ALSO COMMIT TO FULLY IMPLEMENTING COVERAGE TWO POINT NOW AND CAL OR ENSURING ROBUST GRANTS ABOVE. THE POVERTY FOR ALL COLORS FAMILIES AND FOCUS ON PURSUING POLICIES TO IMPROVE THE LABOR MARKET FOR PARENTS WITH LOW INCOMES SO THAT EVERY CALIFORNIA CHILD AND FAMILY COULD THRIVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU- WE WILL GO BACK MY APOLOGIES WE SKIP JENNIFER CRAPPIE- SHE DAY THEY ARE ON THE WEBEX AND SO. HOPEFULLY THEY CAN BEGIN WHEN THEY'RE READY. YES THANK YOU SO MUCH HELLO CHAIRED MEMBERS. MY NAME IS JENNIFER CRAPPIE WITH VOICES CALIFORNIA. THE MEMBERS OF OUR VOICES ARE REALLY UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND THE ISSUES FACING OUR SYSTEM. BECAUSE MANY LIKE MYSELF ARE EITHER CURRENT OR FORMER OUR EXPERTISE IN. WELL PARA VOICES. SPECIFICALLY WORKS ON CHILD CARE ISSUES MANY PARENTS ACCESS CHILD CARE BECAUSE OF THEIR PARTICIPATION IN CAO WORKS. IT IS BECAUSE OF THAT CONNECTION THAT CBS HAS ENGAGED WITH PARA VOICES MEMBERS TO IDENTIFY PROBLEMS IN THE CAO WORKS TO STOP AS WELL AS RECOMMENDATIONS TO ADDRESS THAT. THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES INTENTIONALLY ENGAGE PARENTS THE COW WORKS PROGRAM IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT WAYS AS THEY CREATED THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE REPORT. IT ALL STARTED WITH CAL OR BAD CALIFORNIA OUTCOME AN ACCOUNTABILITY REVIEW WHICH DEVELOPED A NEW SET OF MEASURES TO DETERMINE WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE IN THE CAO WORKS PROGRAM. OVER THE COURSE OF TWO YEARS DSS CONVENED A COHORT OF PARENTS TO MEET THE- AND PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CAL OR- IN ORDER TO HELP PARENTS EQUITABLE ACCESS TO PARTICIPATE. DSS PROVIDED PARENTS WITH STIPENDS FOR PARTICIPATION IN MEETINGS AND COVER THE COSTOF TRANSPORTATION CHILDCARE. MEALS INTERPRETATION AND EVEN PROVIDED A PRIVATE NURSING ROOM FOR ONE OF OUR OUR NEW MOBS. THIS THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN TAKE PARENT ENGAGEMENT REALLY LOOKS LIKE. AFTER THE CULMINATION OF THE COW OR PROCESS A SMALLER GROUP OF AIRPORT ORGANIZER SOME PARENTS CONTINUE TO MEET AS PART OF THAT POLICY ALIGNMENT WORKGROUP. FIFTEEN HELP IDENTIFY SPECIFIC SHORT MIDDLE AND LONG TERM POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WOULD HELP REALIZE THAT VISION CREATED BY THE CAL OR G. THERE ARE THREE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS THAT PURPOSES WOULD LIKE TO SEE ELEVATED TO THE TOP PRIORITY. WHILE ALL OF THE PROPOSALS IN THE REPORT ARE WORTHY PARENTS ARE ELEVATING THE FOLLOWING THREE AS THE ONES THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS BUDGET CYCLE. FIRST RECOMMENDATION THIRTEEN HE FIRST AND FOREMOST IS THE RECOMMENDATION TO INSTITUTE A FAMILY NAVIGATOR FOR PEER SUPPORT MODEL. AS WE ALL KNOW HOME NAVIGATING THE CALIFORNIA SYSTEM CAN BE CHALLENGING AND CAN BE FILLED WITH LOTS OF INTENSE AND OVERWHELMING REQUIREMENTS. HAVING ANOTHER PERSON VERBALLY ONE WHO'S BEEN THROUGH THE CALL WORK SYSTEM THEMSELVES CAN HELP FAMILIES NAVIGATE THE CONFUSING LANDSCAPE OF SUPPORT. IDEALLY THESE NAVIGATORS SHOULD HAVE DIRECT EXPERIENCE WITH THE CALL WORKS TO STOP. IT'S SO EASY FOR PARENTS TO FEEL JUDGED FOR BEING INVOLVED IN THE SYSTEM THAT JUDGMENT REALLY PREVENTS PARENTS FROM SEEKING OUT THE RESOURCES AND SUPPORT THAT THEIR FAMILY SO DESPERATELY NEED. FORMER CAO WORKS PARTICIPANTS ARE IN A POSITION TO MEET INCOMING CALL WORKS FAMILIES WITH EMPATHY WITH LOVE AND CARE THAT THEY REALLY NEED TO STRENGTHEN THEIR FAMILIES. NO ONE GOES ON WELFARE BECAUSE THEY WANT TO. PEOPLE WHO SEEK OUT HOW WORKS ARE DOING SO AT A TIME A TREMENDOUS HONOR ABILITY. WITHOUT FAIL PARENTS CONSISTENTLY REPORT FEELING. THROUGHOUT THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH OUR- AND THAT THE HUMANIZATION IS FELT EVEN MORE STRONGLY FROM PARENTS OF COLOR. FAMILY NAVIGATORS WHO'VE BEEN THERE BEFORE WE BRING AN IMPORTANT HUMAN ELEMENT AND ALLOW FAMILIES TO LET THEIR GUARDS DOWN AND OPEN THEMSELVES UP TO THE POSSIBILITIES FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES. THAT IS WHY INSTITUTING A FAMILY NAVIGATOR MODEL IS THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY OF PARENTS. RECOMMENDATION THIRTEEN P. RELATED TO FAMILY NAVIGATORS THANK FAMILY NAVIGATOR MODEL IS TO REINSTATE THE FAMILY SERVICE TEAM. I TESTIFIED IN THIS VERY HEARING ROOM ABOUT BEING A BENEFICIARY OF ACCESSING THE FAMILY SERVICE TEAM WHICH IS A COMPREHENSIVE MULTI DISCIPLINARY APPROACH TO PROVIDING SERVICES FOR FAMILIES. IT BEGINS TO ADDRESS ALL THE CHALLENGES AND BARRIERS THAT FAMILIES FACE SO I KNOW THAT THEY CAN GET TO THE PROGRAM AND HOW FULFILLING AND MEANINGFUL LIVES. HOWEVER THIS WAS CUT FROM THE CALL WORKS- BUDGET DURING THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT RECESSION AND HAS YET TO RETURN. AND FINALLY WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE NAME OF COW WORKS CHANGED- WOULD LIKE TO LOOK AT THAT OF THE SYSTEM IS NOT ONLY ABOUT WORKFORCE OPPORTUNITY HISTORICALLY I WORKED WITH FOR ME MEASURING WORKFORCE PARTICIPATION. THE ONLY EXTRA OF IS ROOTED IN THE NOTION BUT S LONG AS PARENTS ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE WORKFORCE THAT WERE SUCCESSFUL. IT'S NOT JUST THE NAME IT'S A STATEMENT OF WHAT THIS PROGRAM IS ALL ABOUT. OR IS GOING TO WORK COULD BE A PART OF THAT. BUT IT'S TRULY ABOUT SUPPORTING CALIFORNIA FOUND AND SO PARENTS FROM PARAGUAY SAYS REALLY WANT TO SEE THE NAME CHANGED TO HELP THEM. THIS REPORT PROVIDES YOU WITH AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY TO JUST TO CHANGE THE WAY SERVICES ARE DELIVERED HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WE CAN LEAD THE NATION AND NO MORE EQUITABLE PROGRAM THAT DELIVERS HIGH QUALITY COMPREHENSIVE SUPPORTIVE SERVICES TO LIFT FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY AND INTO SUCCESSFUL THRIVING AND MEANINGFUL LIVES. THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT. IS TO COME BACK TO IMPLEMENTING THE ITEMS IN THIS POLICY ALIGNMENT REPORT ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT ARE RANKED HIGHEST. WHAT'S MOST TO CALIFORNIA LAWMAKERS. FOR YOU WANT IT FOR TO KNOW IS THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE DIRECTLY IMPACTED THE PEOPLE IN OUR WORK THEMSELVES HAD A VOICE IN MAKING THESE POLICIES FROM THE BEGINNING WHICH IN AND OF ITSELF MEANS THAT THEY HAVE A HIGHER CHANCE OF BEING SUCCESSFUL. FAMILIES KNOW WHAT WORKS. AND WHAT DOESN'T WORK WE'RE ASKING YOU TO LISTEN TO THEM AND TO TAKE ACTION ON THE RECOMMENDATION. IT'S PAST TIME WE HAVE A SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE CAN BE PROUD OF. AND THIS IS A BLUEPRINT TO ACTUALLY MAKE IT HAPPEN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS CRAPPIE NEXT WE HAVE MY CARROLLTON IS THE DIRECTOR OF POLICY AND ADVOCACY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. WITH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AND STAFF APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TODAY ON THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC- YOU FOR QUITE AWHILE QUITE A LOT ALREADY FROM. THE OTHER THE OTHER PANELISTS SO I'M GOING TO TRY TO FOCUS MY REMARKS INTO A COUPLE OF AREAS SOME OF WHICH YOU'VE HEARD A BIT ABOUT BUT HOPEFULLY PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT- DIFFERENT- PERSPECTIVE ON THEM- I THINK YOUR ANALYSIS DOES A VERY GOOD JOB I THINK ABOUT LINE SORT OF THE PATH THAT WE'VE BEEN ON- YOU KNOW I THINK THERE WAS A REAL CONSENSUS AMONG- THE COUNTIES THE ADVOCATES. OF LEGISLATORS THE DEPARTMENT- THAT WE REALLY NEEDED TO TAKE A REAL FRESH LOOK AT THE CAR WORKS PROGRAM- I THINK- WE WILL WE'RE LEARNING A LOT AND SEEN THAT THE APPROACH THAT WE HAVE BEEN TAKING FOR MANY DECADES. NOT ONLY WAS A COMPLIANCE ORIENTED MODEL BUT I THINK IN MANY WAYS HAD SORT OF. PLATEAUED AND WAS NO LONGER PROVIDING THE BENEFIT THAT WE THOUGHT WE MIGHT GET SOME MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF THE FAMILIES REALLY WEREN'T ABLE TO PARTICIPATE EFFECTIVELY IN THE PROGRAM. AND WHILE THERE WAS A PERCENTAGE OF THE FACT THE CASES THAT COULD MEET THE WORK PARTICIPATION RATE AND ALL THE COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS THE COUNTIES THAT WASN'T THE CASE FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE FAMILIES AND I THINK THAT UNDERSTANDING REALLY KIND OF DROVE THE DESIRE FOR BOTH- CAL WORKS TWO POINT NO. AND EVENTUALLY THE FORMATION OF CALIFORNIA- AND- THE- YOU KNOW THE- AS WE WENT THROUGH THAT PROCESS OF DISCOVERY AND I THINK- I LEARNED MORE ABOUT IT I THINK IT. IT BECAME APPARENT TO US THAT- THE RULE OF THE RULES OF THE PROGRAM ITSELF WERE A MAJOR BARRIER TO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE- WHEN WE WERE DESIGNING CAL OR FOR EXAMPLE THERE WERE SEVERAL MOMENTS WHERE- WE REALIZE THAT WHAT WE WANTED TO MEASURE SOMETHING WE HAD A LAW THAT ACTUALLY MANDATED THE OFFICES. AND SO THAT IT WAS FROM THAT MOMENT I THINK THAT WE BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT WE NEEDED TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THESE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT HAVE NOW COME FORWARD TO YOU TODAY- AND I THINK- THOSE. THE RECKON I THINK ARE BEGINNING I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY CAPTURE EVERYTHING THAT WE NEED TO DO AND CAL WORKS- BUT I DO THINK THAT THEY ARE A START- BUT WE REALLY HAVE TO GO BACK I THINK AND I. WILL CALL IT THIS JUST FOR MAYBE TO BE A LITTLE BIT COLORFUL- THE ORIGINAL SCENT OF TANNA WHICH IS. THE WORK PARTICIPATION RATE THAT WAS IMPOSED ON COUNTIES COMBINED WITH THE THIRTY HOUR WORK REQUIREMENTS AND THE USE OF SANCTIONS TO COMPLY. PEOPLE TO HAVE TO PERFORM THE DUTIES THAT WERE ASSIGNED TO THEM- AND SO I THINK WE'RE AT THIS REALLY CRITICAL JUNCTURE WHERE WE CONTINUE. TO LIVE UNDER THE FEDERAL LAW AND CONTINUE TO PUSH COUNTY EMPLOYEES TO CONTINUE TO HOLD PEOPLE TO THAT STANDARD EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW. IT'S HARD FOR MANY CASES. OR WE CAN CHOOSE THE PATH OF BRAVERY WHICH IS TO SAY WE'RE GOING TO REALLY FOLLOW CAL WORKS TWO POINT OH AND THE CALOR MODELS AND WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING IN OUR SESSIONS AND- TAKE THE RISK. THAT THIS IS WHAT'S BEST FOR FAMILIES AND KNOW THAT IN IF SOME FEDERAL PENALTY WERE TO COME DOWN I WOULD REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT NO STATE HAS EVER BEEN ASSESSED A PENALTY ON ON THE ALL FAMILY RATE ONLY ON THE TWO POUND. RATE THAT THAT RISK IS WELL WORTH TAKING. THAT OUR FAMILIES ARE IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO US THAT WE WOULD DO THE RIGHT THING AND WE WOULD MOVE BEYOND THE CAL WORKS- PENALTY FORMULA THAT WE HAVE IN CURRENT LAW SO YOUR- YOUR ANALYSIS- PUTS THE LAW RIGHT OUT THERE THINK IT'S ON PAGE SEVENTEEN OF THE ANALYSIS THAT'S WASN'T HALF A PAGE LONG- AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT I REALLY BELIEVE THE ADMINISTRATION NEEDS TO TAKE A REALLY STRONG LOOK AT IF WE WANT THIS PROGRAM TO A BALL BEYOND WHERE IT IS BANNED FOR THE LAST TWO AND A HALF DECADES WE NEED TO CHANGE THE MOTIVATIONS THAT ARE DRIVING COUNTIES AND CAO AND THE WORKERS- THAT WE'VE WE'VE HELD IN PLACE FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF DECADES. SO AGAIN I WOULD JUST REMIND THAT THE REASON THAT WE- WE WENT THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND I HAVE NOT YET ACKNOWLEDGED THE GREAT WORK OF CDSS AND MISS MAY CENTER STAFF THEY'VE BEEN A JOY TO WORK WITH AND THEY'VE DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB AND WE GOT INTERRUPTED BECAUSE COVE AND ALL THAT BUT WE PICKED THE PIECES BACK UP AND REPORTS NOW IN FRONT OF YOU AND SO I DO WANT TO COMMEND THE DEPARTMENT FOR THE WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE. BUT THE PURPOSE OF THIS THOUGH WAS TO IDENTIFY LEGAL BARRIERS TO REFORMING CAL WORKS AT ALLOWING TWO POINT OO TO REALLY FUNCTION THE WAY THAT WE BELIEVE IT CAME OUT OF THE WAY THE SCIENCE TELLS US THAT IT CAN AND SO I THINK AS WE LOOK AT THESE RECOMMENDATIONS I WOULD REALLY DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THOSE THINGS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED IN THE REPORT THAT ARE LEGAL IN NATURE AND- SO I THINK. YOU KNOW NUMBER ONE OUR LIST IS CLEARLY THE TOWN OF PENALTY PASS ON. AND REFORMING THAT PROCESS I THINK WE'RE REFORMING THAT SYSTEM TAKING THAT BERRIER OFF OF COUNTIES IS THE NUMBER ONE THING THAT WE NEED TO DO TO MAKE THIS SYSTEM THIS PROGRAM WORK BETTER. AND REALLY HELP FAMILIES GET OUT OF POVERTY. NOW I THINK YOU PROBABLY HEARD THAT FROM ALMOST ALL OF US TODAY SO I THINK I WON'T GO DOWN THAT PATH TO MUCH FURTHER- BUT I DO WANT TO CALL OUT A FEW OTHER THINGS THAT ARE IN THE REPORT- THAT. I THINK ARE OF THE SAME NATURE- ONE IS THAT FOR MANY MANY YEARS. CALIFORNIA HAS HAD A VERY. LIMITED POLICY OF PROVIDING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WAIVERS FROM WELFARE TO WORK- RIGHT NOW IT'S COUNTY OPTION ESSENTIALLY IF A FAMILY COMES IN HAS A HISTORY OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THE COUNTY GETS THE DETERMINE SENSUALLY WHETHER OR NOT THAT PERSON SHOULD PARTICIPATE IN WELFARE TO WORK- WE THINK THAT'S COMPLETELY BACKWARDS WE THINK THAT THE OPTION REALLY OUGHT TO LIVE WITH FAMILIES ABOUT THEIR WILLINGNESS AND THEIR READINESS TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE WE ALSO DON'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WELLSTONE AMENDMENT VERY WELL ON OUR STATE WHICH COULD HELP OUR WORK PARTICIPATION RATE BY THE WAY. AND I'M SORRY DO A CHECKPOINT WILSON AMENDMENT THE WASSERMAN IS A PART OF THE TOWN OF LAW THAT SAYS THAT IF I IF THE STATE DOES- PROVIDE A WAIVER FROM WELFARE T WORK TO DO UNDOCUMENTED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THAT THAT CASE DURING THOSE MONTHS DOESN'T COUNT AGAINST THE WORK STATION RIGHT SO WE DON'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT VERY WELL ARE LAW ACTUALLY KIND OF PUSHES IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION SO WE WOULD WE WOULD WE WOULD LIFT THAT UP THAT'S SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT AND THIS THIS CONCEPT IS CAPTURED IN A BILL- BY SIMPLY MEMBER REYES AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTY SEVEN RIGHT NOW A CO SPONSOR BY WESTERN CENTER ANOTHER ADVOCATES. AND SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY THINK NEEDS TO BE CHANGED SOON- I WILL PILE ON TO JENNIFER CRAPPIES COMMENT ABOUT THE NAVIGATORS- WE THINK OF THE MORE THAT WE CAN GET FORMER CAL WORKS RECIPIENTS TO HELP CURRENT CAL WORKS RECIPIENTS WHO HAVE THAT KNOWLEDGE I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF WORKING WITH MANY MANY COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO HAVE LEARNED THE SYSTEM BY BEING IN TOWERS ALL THE YEARS AND KNOW HOW TO MAKE IT WORK FOR THEM AND I THINK IF WE WERE TO REACH INTO THE US GIVE THEM JOBS WITHIN THE COUNTIES HELP THEM. GET THOSE JOBS FOR THEM SO THEY CAN HELP FAMILIES I THINK WOULD REALLY ASSIST A LOT OF A LOT OF PEOPLE- WE LIKE THE NAME CAL CAL FAMILIES- WE'VE BEEN FUNNY THAT SHE SAID THAT BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN CALLING IT CAL FAN FOR A WHILE WE DON'T USE CAO WORKS MUCH MORE IN OUR OFFICE AND THEN LASTLY- THERE ARE TWO RECOMMENDATIONS IN THIS REPORT WHICH I THINK ALSO WERE SUBSTANTIVE IN NATURE WHICH REALLY ADDRESS PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT FOR MANY YEARS- ONE IS PEOPLE. DO NOT GET THEIR SUPPORT SERVICES IS. AND PER. TRANSPORTATION NOT YEARSWE DID. SOME GREAT WORK AND WE NOW GET CHILD CARE SUBSIDIES TO PEOPLE WE MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE GET THEM. FOR THE FIRST TWELVE MONTHS THAT THEY'RE ON THE PROGRAM. AND WE ALL WORK TOGETHER TO GET TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. NOW I THINK WE NEED TO DO THE SAME FOR TRANSPORTATION. IF YOU IF A PERSON IS REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN WELFARE TO WORK SERVICES. THEY SHOULD GET AN ADDITIONAL SUM OF MONEY EVERY MONTH ON THEIR- ON THEIR- EBT CARD. SO THEY CAN USE TO PAY FOR THEIR TRANSPORTATION COST. THE IDEA OF HAVING. GREATER BUREAUCRACY AND FORMS OF PEOPLE HAVING TO FILL THEM OUT AND ALL OF THAT THAT GOES ALONG WITH THAT THAT COULD BE ANOTHER OPTION. I THINK JUST A STANDARDIZATION OF THIS APPROACH WOULD BE THE PROPER WAY TO GO. I'M NOT KNOWING THAT WE'RE HERE FROM COUNCILS LATER ON IT MAY TAKE A WHILE TO BUILD IMPLEMENT THAT IN. FOR A YEAR TO. BUT I THINK IF WE MADE THE DECISION THIS YEAR. TO IMPLEMENT THAT AND GOT THAT IN THE QUEUE. THEN IN A COUPLE OF YEARS THAT POLICY WOULD TAKE EFFECT AND REALLY HAVE A- MARKET EFFECT FOR FOLKS. NOT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT THEIR TRANSPORTATION COSTS. AND THEN LASTLY I THINK A NEW THING THAT WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF SUPPORT SERVICES. YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T REALLY DO YOUR JOB YOU CAN'T. YOUR KIDS CAN'T STUDY VERY WELL UNLESS THEY HAVE AN INNER INTERNET CONNECTION- AND THIS REPORT ALSO CALLS OUT FOR. LIKE WE DO WITH DIAPERS- PROVIDING THAT- INTERNET CONNECTION SO THE FAMILIES ACTUALLY. HAVE THAT SERVICE AVAILABLE TO THEM THEY CAN ATTEND THEIR COMMUNITY COLLEGE COURSE THAT THEY KNEW TWO ONE. ONLINE AND DO A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS THAT REALLY FRANKLY IN THIS MODERN SOCIETY. ARE REQUIRE INTERNET CONNECTION. OKAY LASTLY AND YOU ASKED. ABOUT WHAT OTHER KIND OF THINGS WE CAN DO TO SUPPORT OUR FAMILIES. YOU KNOW YOU KNOW. WHAT'S GONNA COME OUT OF MY MOUTH NEXT MISTER CHAIR. I WE NEED TO GIVE PEOPLE MORE MONEY- WE KNOW MONEY WORKS- YOU KNOW AND IF WE GIVE PEOPLE MORE MONEY THEY'RE GONNA STAY HOUSED. THEY'RE GOING TO THEIR KIDS ARE GONNA BE BETTER OFF- ALL SORTS OF GOOD POSITIVE THINGS HAPPEN FOR MORE MONEY. BUT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT WE CAN DO. AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER. HE IS TAKING A LOOK AT SOME THINGS THAT WERE NOT NECESSARILY INCLUDED WITHIN. THE- THE- THE CURRENT REPORT THAT THAT'S IN FRONT OF YOU- FOR EXAMPLE. WE REALLY DIDN'T GET TO HAVE A REAL DEEP EXAMINATION OF ELIGIBILITY- YOU KNOW WE KNOW WE HAVE A LOW CASE LOAD NUMBER RIGHT NOW. AND I THINK WE NEED TO SPEND THE TIME TO. TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE WAY THAT THE APPLICATION PROCESS GOES. AND ALL THE BEARS REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN PLACE AND EXAMINE THAT TO SEE IF WE CAN STRIP SOME OF THAT BACK. AND HELP FAMILIES GET ON AID MORE- SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD CONSIDER. I THINK ALSO WE HAVE TO REDUCE THE USE OF SANCTIONS IN THIS PROGRAM. ARE AND THE SANCTIONS REALLY GO BACK TO THIS ISSUE ABOUT THE WORK PARTICIPATION RATE THE REASON THAT SANCTIONS ARE YOU SO HEAVILY IN POWER. CALIFORNIA IS THAT THEY- ARE THE TOOL. FOR MAKING PEOPLE COMPLY WHY WE STRIPPED AWAY FROM. AS A EFFORT TO. PEOPLE TO TRY TO DO WE WANT THEM TO DO. THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT APPROACH WE HAVE TO WORK WITH PEOPLE WHERE THEY'RE AT TO HELP THEM GET. THEM INTO A PLACE WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO WILLINGLY PARTICIPATE AND DO THE ACTIVITIES. THAT THEY KNOW ARE GOING TO BENEFIT THEM- AND THEN LASTLY- WE'RE HOPING THAT WE CAN HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT- THE USE OF. WHAT WE WOULD CONSIDER- OVER USE OF FRAUD INVESTIGATIONS WITHIN THE HOURS PROGRAM- THERE IS SORT OF THIS- NOT EVERY COUNTY I WOULD NOT SAY THAT BUT IN SOME COUNTIES WE ARE SEEN- THE USE OF FRAUD INVESTIGATIONS AND- THIS CONSTANT KIND OF EXAMINING PEOPLE AND THEIR FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES- HAS REALLY THREATENING AND DRIVING PEOPLE- HERE OFTEN PEOPLE BEING FORCED TO QUIT THE PROGRAM UNDER THE THREAT OF A LEGAL PROSECUTION- THAT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT TO US AT ALL AND- IT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK THE LEGISLATURE REALLY NEEDS TO EXAMINE AS WE GO FORWARD WITH THIS PROGRAM AND WITHOUT I WILL STOP THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM RYAN ANDERSON WENT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. GOOD AFTERNOON RYAN ANDERSON'S LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE. OF FIRST WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE AGENDA- AS SOON AS BEEN NOTED THIS REPORT JUST CAME OUT AND HAD A GREAT NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS WE ARE STILL IN THE EARLY STAGES. OF READING THROUGH A AND- UNDERSTANDING EACH OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS MADE WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT THE SUB COMMITTEE HAS A PARTICULAR INTEREST IN IDENTIFYING THE POTENTIAL FISCAL COSTS AND IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH EACH OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS AND WE ARE HAPPY IN AVAILABLE- TO HELP. WITH ALL THOSE BUT OF COURSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE- DOING OUR DUE DILIGENCE WITH EACH OF THEM- NOW JUST TO TAKE A STEP BACK A LITTLE BIT- AMONG THE BROADER ISSUES THAT ARE. BEING RAISED- BOTH IN THE REPORTS OVER DISCUSSING AND THE COMMENTS THAT YOU FOR TODAY. ARE REALLY JUST- FUNDAMENTALLY IS THIS PROGRAM WORKING AS INTENDED I AND AS PART OF THAT IS IT REACHING THE PEOPLE IT'S INTENDED TO REACH AND HELPING THEM- WE JUST LIKE TO KNOW WITH THAT THAT WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF WORK THAT WE THINK IS RELEVANT AND WILL HELP INFORM THIS CONVERSATION. LAST YEAR WE- PUBLISHED THE FIRST A PART IN A SERIES OF WORK THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO ON THE CAL WORKS TAKE UP RATE I KNOW AND IN PREVIOUS HEARINGS JUST THIS YEAR. SUBCOMMITTEE HAS EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THAT AND WE'VE BECAUSE OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE'S INTEREST CONTINUE TO WORK ON IDENTIFYING WAYS THAT WE CAN- MAKE SURE THAT THAT MEASURE. IS AS APPROPRIATE AND ACCURATE AS IT COULD WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT ON THEIR EFFORTS AS WELL. BUT THE OVERALL ESTIMATE IS NOT A PARTICULARLY- HIGH TAKE UP RATE WE THINK ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT. ABOUT THREE OUT OF EVERY FIVE ELIGIBLE FAMILIES IS CURRENTLY ENROLLED IN THE PROGRAM. I'LL WHAT THE REST OF THAT PROJECT ENTAILS AND A LOT OF ANALYTICAL WORK OVER THE LAST YEAR IS GONE INTO THIS AND WE ARE HOPING. IT WILL BEAR FRUIT AND- IN THE FORM OF PUBLIC PRODUCTS VERY SHORTLY. ARE THE QUESTIONS OF WHY DO THOSE REMAINING TWO FAMILIES NOT ENROLL IN THE PROGRAM- WHICH DEMOGRAPHIC AND ECONOMIC GROUPS ARE LEAST LIKELY TO ENROLL WHICH GEOGRAPHIC AREAS SHALL- CONSISTENT PROPENSITY TO HAVE LOW TAKE UP RATES. AT THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT WE'RE HOPING TO DO AGAIN- DEEPER JUST IN THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS AND WE ARE ALS HOPEFUL THAT. WE'VE BEEN LEARNING A LOT FROM THIS PROCESS AND WE THINK THAT IT WILL INFORM A LOT OF THESE CONVERSATIONS AND ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO BETTER TARGET THEIR PRIORITIES FOR REFORMING THE SYSTEM. AT THE MOMENT THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I THIS IS JANINE DR WITH FINANCE- IN RESPONSE TO THE FIRST TWO QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE REPORT- AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO ASSESS THE REPORT AND WE WILL CONSIDER THE RECOMMENDATIONS ALONG SIDE LEGISLATIVE STAFF HOURS ARE. BUDGET DISCUSSIONS CONTINUE TO EVOLVE THROUGH THIS PROCESS- I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS CONTAINED WITHIN IT WE'RE CONSISTENT WITH THE INVESTMENT THAT WE MADE AS PART OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET OCT- WHICH AS THE DEPARTMENT AS MENTIONED BEFORE. DID INCLUDE THAT STATEWIDE TRAINING ON RACIAL EQUITY IN IMPLICIT BIAS FOR CALVERT COUNTY CASE WORKERS. AS WELL AS AN INCREASED NUMBER OF HOURS BUDGETED FOR INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT- BENEFITS CAL USER TESTING. AND A COWARD STATEWIDE PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGN AS WELL SO MOVING FORWARD IT'LL BE IMPORTANT FOR US TO CONSIDER. AND ASSESS THE FISCAL IMPLICATIONS AUTOMATION NEEDS ADMINISTRATION COSTS AND ANY POSSIBLE IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS AS WE CONTINUE THESE DISCUSSIONS- AND I'M MOVING ON TO THE OTHER QUESTION RELATED TO THE WORK PARTICIPATION RATE- THE W. P. R. IS AN INHERENT FEATURE OF THE FEDERAL TANF PROGRAM I'M SO CALIFORNIA MUST MEET THOSE REQUIREMENTS IN ORDER TO AVOID PENALTY REDUCTIONS TO THE THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR TANNA FOR BLOCK GRANTS AND BECAUSE BOTH THE STATE AND THE COUNTIES SHARE RESPONSIBILITY FOR OPERATING NOT PROGRAM. IT IS OPERATIONALLY NECESSARY THAT BOTH THE STATE AND COUNTY SHARE THAT LIABILITY- AND WE DO WANT TO NOTE THAT ONE OF THE PRIMARY PURPOSES OF CAL OR IS TO COLLECT BETTER HIGHER QUALITY DATA SERVER THAT- THAT DATA CAN INFORM OUTCOME MEASURES- DESPITE THE- W. P. R. THANK YOU WITH THAT I WILL BRING IT BACK UP. TO THE DYESS. FIRST GOING TO START- MISS SUCH FULL YEAR ROUND YOU HAD REFERENCED THE RAND STUDY REGARDING- THE INHERENT CONFLICT THAT OCCURS BETWEEN W. P. R. AND BENEFITS AND WOULD LOVE TO FOLLOW UP MY OFFICE HAS. A NUMBER OF DATA WONKS WHO LOVE TO DIG IN AND SO JUST WOULD APPRECIATE THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL IF I COULD BUT I'M GONNA BE IN WITH YOU MISS JOHNSON DIRECTOR JOHNSON IF I CAN- I'D LIKE TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO PAGE THIRTEEN OF THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET AND- POLICY. CENTERS REPORT THAT WE HAVE IN OUR AGENDA AND THE MIDDLE PARAGRAPH THAT STATES. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT EVALUATES THE STATE PROGRAMS ON HOW WILL THEY SERVE FAMILIES IN CRISIS RATHER THAN- BUT ON RATHER THAN LOOKING AT HOW WE ARE SERVING FAMILIES IN CRISIS INSTEAD WE'RE LOOKING AT W. P. R. I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT LATITUDE WE DO HAVE AS A STATE. TO COUNTERACT THIS AND ENABLE FAMILIES TO THRIVE IN OUR TENNIS PROGRAMS IN LIGHT OF WHAT WE HAVE JUST HEARD FROM FINANCE. HOW COULD THE REMOVAL OF THIS COUNTY SHARE OF THE PENALTY HELP US TO ACHIEVE THE AGENCIES ARTICULATED GOALS AROUND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND WHOLE PERSON CARE HOPING YOU CAN COMMENT ON THAT AS WELL AS WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S A WAIVER PROCESS OR OTHER MEANS FOR US TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THE SAME GOALS. THE CHURCH CARE THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTIONS- FIRST AND FOREMOST I WOULD SAY THAT- I WON IT GONNA RESTATE IN IT IT'S A COMMITMENT WE MADE TOGETHER. AT THAT W. P. R. DOES NOT IN AND OF ITSELF ADEQUATELY DEMONSTRATE THE SUCCESS OF THOSE THAT PARTICIPATE IN CARRACKS AND THOSE THAT SUPPORT THEM TO THE PER THAT SUCCESS. BOB AND AGAIN THAT'S WHY WE ARE HERE WITH THE ACT CALOR AND MOVING FORWARD TO A MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT HOW FAMILIES ARE DOING AND THAT IS A COMMITMENT IN WHAT WE ARE DOING AND IMPLEMENTING TOGETHER- IN TERMS OF- OPPORTUNITIES TO- INFLUENCE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN AND WHERE THE STATE CAN AT- INTER INTERACT. I YOU HEARD ABBAS MAYES A SPEAK TO WHAT WE HAD WAS A TEMPORARY OPTION AN OPPORTUNITY WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RELATED TO COVET WHICH WAS TO AVOID THE PENALTY BY BEING ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IN FACT THE- CIRCUMSTANCES THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY REALLY CREATED ENVIRONMENT CHEN WHICH- AT THAT WAS UNLIKELY TO ACHIEVE. WE'VE ALSO LOOKED AT THAT KIND OF HOLISTICALLY YEAR TO YEAR. REALLY ASKING THE QUESTION IN TERMS OF THE FEDERAL MEASURES WHAT ARE THE- VARIABLES IMPACTING THAT IN I THINK TO MR HERALD COMMENTS AT THE FRAMEWORK THAT WE'VE PUT PUT OUT TOGETHER IN CAL OR- AT IS AT IT AGAIN WORK AS PART OF. A LARGER MORE COMPREHENSIVE- SET OF OUTCOMES THAT WE. ARE EXPECTING BE A CHEAP WITH THE COMPONENTS THE STRING THAT WE ARE THAT WE WORKING ON. SO I JUST WANT TO MENTION THAT- SO THAT SO WE DO HAVE THIS TEMPORARY OPTION WHICH WE HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE EVAN WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK TO ADD GOING FORWARD. AT TWO TWO ALSO TESTER HELPS CLARA COMMENTS ON HOW WE'RE COUNTING THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING WE'VE HISTORICALLY LOOKED AT TO THAT SUBPOPULATIONS WITHIN THE LARGER CASELOAD. I WHICH ARE ARE COUNTED IN THE FEDERAL DENOMINATOR IF YOU WELL TO IT TO HOW WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT THAT'S A PLACE THAT WILL CONTINUE TO EXPLORE GOING FORWARD. THE OTHER THING I WANT TO JUST SAY IS THAT- THE TEN OF PROGRAM LARGELY ALSO HAS NOT BEEN RE AUTHORIZED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND SOMETIMES I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER. OPPORTUNITY FOR US TOGETHER YOU HEARD MISS MAKES A SPEAK TO THE WAYS WITH THAT THE FEDERAL ASSOCIATION OF STATES HAVE BEEN. ENGAGED IN SETTING PRIORITIES BUT IN FACT. WE HAVE IN THAT SHARED THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A DIFFERENT WAY IN WHICH WE LOOK AT THE OUTCOMES AND EXPECTATIONS OF OUR TENNIS PROGRAM. AND ENCOURAGE THE FEDS TO LOOK MORE BROADLY SO I DO THINK THAT'S THE CONTINUED OPPORTUNITY WE SHOULD ALL LOOK TOWARDS. THAT'S INFLUENCE- IN TERMS OF THE. WPR ISSUE AS WELL. I MAY BRING IN CENTRAL MCDONOUGH. HERE I WAS. REALLY MOVED WITH YOUR COMMENT ON HOW ITS A REAL CATCH TWENTY TWO AND HOW THERE IS THAT INHERENT CONFLICT. BUT I ALSO FELT THAT YOU CLEARLY ARTICULATED THAT THIS WILL NOT LET COUNTIES BE LESS ACCOUNTABLE. I'D LIKE FOR YOU TO EXPRESS HOW. THE CAL OR GOALS THAT WE ARE DEVELOPING WILL ALLOW US TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE IT YEAH KEVIN SETTLING CWPA THE- THE IDEA BEHIND CAL OR WAS REALLY BUILT ON. THAT STRUCTURE THAT WE'VE YEARS TO REALLY GREAT A FACT IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS. ONE OF THE FIRST BILLS I WORKED OUT BACK WHEN I CAME TO WORK AT D. W. D. A. N. TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND AND ONE. TO DEVELOP THIS THE IDEA OF A CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT STRUCTURE AT THAT TIME ON A CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM THAT INCLUDED A NUMBER OF STEPS THAT WE THAT MODELED CAL OR AFTER. THIS INCLUDES- EVERY WILL INITIALLY ONCE EVERY THREE YEARS NOW IT'S EVERY FIVE YEARS AND WE'RE LOOKING TO DO THE SAME AND- IN CAL OR- OF A REALLY COMPREHENSIVE LOOK. INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY WITH STAKEHOLDERS BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE OF THE ORGANIZATION IN THE COMMUNITY LIKE  MENTIONED CBO'S- USERS OF THE SYSTEM OUR CUSTOMERS AND FAMILIES THAT WE WORK WITH BOTH CURRENT AND FORMER RECIPIENTS. AS WELL AS OUR WORKFORCE AND OTHERS WERE STAKEHOLDERS TO THE PROGRAM. TO SEE HOW WE DOING WHAT DO WE DO WELL WATER AREAS WHERE WE NEED TO IMPROVE AND THAT DRIVES TO A REALLY COMPREHENSIVE REPORT. AND COUPLED WITH THE MEASURE IF THE DATA THAT ARE BEING COLLECTED THAT MR HERALD TALK A LOT MORE I THINK ABOUT THAT I HAD TIME TO- WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT- THE USE OF VARIOUS PROPHECIES THAT WE THINK ARE VERY PROMISING. OF THE SORT OF WAYS IN WHICH WERE SERVING AND ENGAGING WITH FAMILIES AS WELL AS SURVEY DATA YOU MUST CRAPPIE AND HER TEAM- AT PARENT VOICES AND THAT PARENTS AND FAMILIES THAT THEY WORK WITH REALLY HELPED TO SPEARHEAD. AND COUNTIES PILOT DID A SURVEY FOR THOSE WHO ARE CUSTOMERS OF THE PROGRAM TO PROVIDE THEIR FEEDBACK AS WELL ALL OF THAT IS TO FEED INTO HERO. OF. PUBLIC TO DOCUMENT THROUGH THE WALLS AN IMPROVEMENT PLAN. TO AND NAY COUNTY TO SET GOALS. IN HERE. AND WORK OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. THOSE GOALS. AND I SHE THEIR PROGRESS. AND HOW THEY'RE DOING IN YOU KNOW REGULAR KIND OF REPORTS AND FOLLOWING IT UP. ON THAT THE SYSTEM THAT WE'VE SEEN WORK NOW FOR TWO DECADES OF CHILD WELFARE WE'RE STILL AT THE FRONT END OF THAT AND CAL WORK. BUT ALL OF THAT IS TO CREATE THAT ACCOUNTABILITY THAT YOU REALLY IF YOU JUST HAVE ONE MEASURE THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT AND ONE. PENALTY AREA- REALLY I THINK AND OUR SYSTEM ACROSS ALL OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES WOULD NOT A LOT AWAY FROM THE IDEA THAT PENALIZING. THAT SYSTEM IS THE WAY TO INCENTIVIZE OUTCOMES AND BETTER PROFIT FEES REALLY I THINK SHINING LIGHT. AND HAPPY PEOPLE LOOK AT THAT SYSTEM AND HAVE AVAILABLE MEASURES- AND PLANS THAT CAN BE THE PEOPLE CAN BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO FROM THAT YOU KNOW KIND OF THE DIRECTOR. TO HELP WITH YOU KNOW STAFF WHO ARE IMPLEMENTING ANTI HOW WE'RE DOING AND WORKING WITH OUR CUSTOMERS IS THE WAY TO REALLY HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY WITHOUT HAVING TO HOLD THE THREAT OF A PENALTY OF SOME KIND OVER. THE COUNTIES HAD IN THIS CASE. THANK YOU FOR THAT I AM TO- MOVE ON TO MISS GROUPIE. COMMENTS I WANT TO UP LIFT WHAT YOU SAID HOW THIS IS AN AUTHENTIC INVOLVEMENT OF PARENT VOICES THAT SPEAKS LOUDLY TO MANY OF US. WHO CARE ABOUT THE INVOLVEMENT HERE IN THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE AND JUST REALLY APPRECIATE. THAT TESTIMONY AS A VALIDATES MUCH OF THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING HERE WITH IN CALIFORNIA. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO UPLIFT YOUR COMMENTS ON THIRTEEN IAN THIRTEEN DO YOU FOR THE FAMILY NAVIGATOR PEER SUPPORT MODEL AS WELL AS- TO REINSTATE THE FAMILY SERVICE TEAM AND WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT THOUGHTS ON THOSE TWO PROPOSALS. AS WE HEARD THEY ARE PRIORITIES FOR OUR FAMILIES. SURE CHAIR IN AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE QUESTION I WILL TELL YOU HAVE HAD THE GREAT PRIVILEGE AT AS AS MISS CRAPPIE MENTIONED THERE'S BEEN A VARIETY OF WAYS IN WHICH WE'VE BEEN GAUGED OUT WITH CURRENT AND FORMER CAL EXPERTISE DEPEND SEN. I WILL NEVER FORGET- APPARENT DESCRIBING- THEIR VARIOUS- BOTH EXPERIENCE WITH DIFFERENT WORKERS THAT THEY HAD TO NAVIGATE AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHO TO TELL WHAT INFORMATION TO CONTINUE IN SUPPORT BUT ALSO. ADD NOT KNOWING THE FULL ARRAY OF WHAT OUR PROGRAM A VERY COMPREHENSIVE ARRAY THAT WE BUILT OVER TIME TOGETHER AND- SO I WOULD JUST SAY THAT- I THINK- WE ARE BOTH COMMITTED AND I THINK TO THAT THE POINTS MISSING ONLY DONALD MADE TO ARUND THE- STAFF AT WIND WE ARE. COMPLETELY COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT. THAT COUNTY STAFF HAVE THE HAVE THE TOOLS AND SUPPORTS THAT THEY NEED WE'VE GONE AND DONE SEVERAL DIFFERENT COUNTY SITE VISITS TO REALLY UNDERSTAND. HOW THE COMPONENTS OF SHARING INFORMATION ORIENTATIONS WE SAT THROUGH IT IN A HOW HOW IS THAT YOU KNOW YOU KIND OF NEED TO KNOW WHAT WHAT'S AVAILABLE IN THE MOMENT YOU NEED IT. YOU CAN ALWAYS- FULLY COMPREHENDS EVERYTHING BEING OFFERED TO YOU IN THE FIRST YEAR AND AN ORIENTATION IT'S GOING GOING AROUND SO. THE IDEA THAT WE CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN THE ABILITY IN THE PROGRAM FOR FAMILIES TO NAVIGATE AND ACCESS THE RESOURCE AND SUPPORT THEY NEEDED AT SOMETHING THAT WE'RE- CERTAINLY COMMITTED TO- IN JUST MORE BROADLY IN TERMS OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WHERE WE'RE COMMITTED TO LOOK TAKING A LOOK AND SEE WHAT'S- POSSIBLE FOR OPPORTUNITIES IN THE FUTURE. I THINK WE HEARD CLEARLY FROM MY CARROLLTON ABOUT HOUSE SO OFTEN FAMILIES. PARENTS ARE ENTERING IN IN SITUATIONS LIKE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. WHERE THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO IMMEDIATELY BE ABLE TO. HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT RETURNING BACK TO WORK BUT INSTEAD NEED MANY OF THOSE SUPPORTIVE SERVICES. I'M SURE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING AND GIVING THEM THE BEST CHANCE OF SUCCESS. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON WHAT MY CHARACTER WAS SAYING ABOUT OTHER SUPPORT OF SERVICES SUCH AS- TRANSPORTATION AND INTERNET- WOULD LOVE TO HEAR WHETHER YOU'D- THINK THOSE WORK IN CONCERT TORE. IF ARE STAND. BY THEM SO- AS I BELIEVE THERE'S A GREAT CHANCE FOR US TO IMPROVE THE PROGRAM AND MEET PEOPLE'S BASIC NEEDS. ABSOLUTELY APPRECIATE- AGAIN THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND HERE ONE I WOULD JUST SAY THAT WE HAVE AGAIN TOGETHER- THE ADMINISTRATION LEGISLATURE MADE SOME INVESTMENTS IN BROADBAD SO GLAD TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE MAXIMIZING THOSE ACROSS AND KIND OF FULLY GETTING ACCESS TO SEE A FEW DIFFERENT EXAMPLES HERE. AT TODAY THAT WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT PICKED THE PARTICIPANTS AND HOW WORKS ARE GETTING ACCESS TO OTHER COMPONENTS WHETHER IT'S THE ACCESS TO BE ABLE TO GO TO PARKS IN THE IN THE GOLDEN. BEAR PASTORE OTHER ECONOMIC SPORTS EXETER QUITE QUITE A RANGE THAT WE'RE GLAD T SEE WHAT ELSE WE CAN BE DOING ON THAT FRONT WE DID AB. EMPLOYMENT AT DURING THE PANDEMIC A LAPTOP THAT PROGRAM WHERE WE WERE ABLE TO DISTRIBUTE LAPTOPS TO THOSE- IN THE PROGRAM WAS ALSO IMPLEMENTED A NEW INITIATIVE WE REFERENCED AT IT'S CALLED SELL AD WHERE WE HAVE INCREASED THE ABILITY FOR OUR PARTICIPANTS TO ENGAGE. THROUGH THE PHONE- INDIFFERENCE EDUCATIONAL AND OTHER ACTIVITIES AND WE'VE SEEN GREAT SUCCESS WITH THAT IN AGAIN COUNTS AT IT TOWARDS SOME OF THE MEASUREMENTS THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY REQUIRED TO LOOK AT SO AS IT RELATES TO TRANSPORTATION AGAIN. WE HAVE AT TO THE POINT THAT HAVE BEEN MADE MADE SOME PROGRESS AND VERY SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AND HOW WE CAN MORE EASILY STREAMLINE ACCESS TO GET TO GETTING TO THOSE SERVICES SO GLAD IN THE SPACE TO CONTINUE EXPLORING THIS AREA AS WELL. A FINAL QUESTION IF I COULD- MISS GROUPIES FINAL RECOMMENDATION WAS THAT- THIS IS NOT ONLY ABOUT WORKFORCE THIS REALLY IS ABOUT THE FAMILIES WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR. WHETHER THERE'S A BENEFIT TO US RENAMING THE PROGRAM RE PRIORITIZING WHAT MATTERS FOR US HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND PLACING FAMILIES FIRST. AGAIN OPEN TO. FINANCE THE POINTS THAT WERE MADE AND WE HAD WEEK FREQUENTLY ALSO LIFT UP THE K. AND CAL WORKS FOR KIDS WHICH WE KNOW IS CRITICAL- INTO IN IN A PLACE THAT WE TOGETHER AGAIN HAVE INVESTED. MORE GREATLY AND OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS SO GLAD TO CONTINUE TO EXPLORE WHAT'S POSSIBLE AND REALLY ENSURING THAT. AT THE AT THE OFFICE OFFERING IN THE OPTION UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE PROGRAM IS REPRESENTED IN TERMS OFWHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. IN THE STRENGTH BASED APPROACH THAT WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS. BEFORE WE GO ON TO THE NEXT ITEM I WANT TO THANK THIS PANEL FOR THE IN DEPTH DISCUSSION AND CONVERSATION. TO PREPARE US IN THE NEXT STEPS TO REALIZE THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE POLICY ALIGNMENT REPORT. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE L. A. O. TO ASCERTAIN WHICH OF THE PRIMARY RECOMMENDATIONS. FROM THE POLICY ALIGNMENT REPORT COULD BE READY FOR ADOPTION IN THIS. BUDGET CYCLE. AND THAT THE L. A. O. WORK WITH CDSS TO UNDERSTAND THE GENERAL FUND AMOUNT. WHICH WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. AND ON GOING TO ACCOMPLISH IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS. IF WORK FOR A. PARDON WE WILL BE MOVING ON TO ISSUE TO WHERE WE WILL DISCUSS THE AUTOMATION PROJECTS AND DATA OUTCOMES REPORTING FIRST HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS WE HAVE TWELVE PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL FOR ISSUE TO. BEGINNING WITH BRANDON HAMDARD DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR CALA HHS FOLLOWED BY JOHN BELIEVE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR CAL SAUCE. JOHN HENYON WHO IS THE CHIEF DATA OFFICER FOR THE CENTER FOR DATA INSIGHTS AND INNOVATION RYAN GILLETTE THE RESEARCH AUTOMATION AND DATA DIVISION CHIEF DATA OFFICER WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES CYNTHIA TUCKER DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF CHILD WELFARE DIGITAL. SERVICES OFFICE OF SYSTEMS INTEGRATION A KELLY CHANGE US. JENNIFER ROOD JONES CHILD WELFARE SYSTEMS BRANCH CHIEF WITH CDSS JENNIFER TRACY CAL SAWS ADVOCATES CO LEAD WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS RUBEN CANNELLA WITH THE DIRECTOR OF STRATEGIC EQUITY INITIATIVES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY. BASIC NEEDS COMMITTEE CHAIR AND YOU SEE BASIC NEEDS COCHAIR. KATHY SANDERLING MCDONALD WITH CW DA BRIAN METZGER WITH THE L. A. O. TYLER WOODS AND ROB TROJAN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LET US BEGIN WITH DEPUTY DIRECTOR HANSARD. WHEN YOU ARE READY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- CHAIRMAN ARAMBULA AND HAND COMMITTEE VIRTUAL COMMITTEE MEMBERS- GIVEN THE SIZE THE PANEL AND WE'RE JUST LOOKING AT LOGISTICS I THINK WHAT WE'LL DO IS KIND OF ROTATE THE B. B. AVAILABLE- BUT FIRST AND FOREMOST GOOD TO BE BACK IN PERSON SPEAKING WITH YOU- AFTER THE PAST TWO YEARS- WITH THE WAY THE AGENDAS LAID OUT- JOHN BELAY AND MYSELF HAVE SOME OF THE SAME QUESTIONS BOTH REPRESENTING CAL SIZE WE WILL JOINTLY. USE OUR TIME TOGETHER TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS- FIRST FOREMOST AND BRANDON HANSARD DEPUTY DIRECTOR- THE BENEFIT ENROLLMENT TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT DIVISION AT OFFICE OF SYSTEMS INTEGRATION FOR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. HI JOHN BELAY- EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CAL SIDES WILL ANSWER THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE POSED TO BOTH OF US BUT- WANTED TO THANK YOUR STAFF FOR THE DETAILED PROJECT OVERVIEW AND STATUS IN THE AGENDA. DUE TO THE TIME CONSTRAINTS I'M GOING TO SUMMARIZE- SOME OF THAT THAT WILL ALSO ANSWER- BULLET ONE BULLET FOR OF THE QUESTIONS. SO I'M VERY HAPPY TO REPORT TO YOU TODAY THE CALIFORNIA NOW HAS TWO SAWS SYSTEMS AFTER MANY MANY YEARS OF PLANNING HARD WORK AND IS ON TRACK TO MIGRATE TO THE SINGLE SIZE- IN PRIOR YEARS WE HAVE REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATION AND MIGRATION STRATEGY. MY NAME INPUT. ACTIVITIES CALIFORNIA EMBARKED ON. TO MEET. THE FEDERAL MANDATE OF ONE SIZE SYSTEM BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THIS INCLUDED THE FORMATION OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY COUNCIL'S JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY IN TWENTY NINETEEN. A MONUMENTAL MY MILESTONE OCCURRED ON SEPTEMBER TWENTY SEVENTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHEN THE THIRTY NINE C. FOR COUNTIES JOINED LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND THE FORMER LRS SYSTEM IN CREATING THE FORTY COUNTY CALCITE SYSTEM. THIS SUCCESS HIGHLIGHTS THAT THE SIZE SINGLE SYSTEM STRATEGY IS WORKING WHICH INCLUDES LEVERAGING CLOUD HOSTING RE USE OF THE SCALABLE EXISTING SYSTEM. AND SYSTEM INTEGRATION BY THE CONSORTIUM ALL ENSURING THE FUNCTIONALITY MEETS THE NEEDS OF THE CLIENTS AND BENEFICIARIES FOREMOST COUNTIES AND THE STATE- THE APPROACH HAS AND WILL CONTINUE TO LEVERAGE AND WE USE OUR TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS IMPLEMENT SHARED SERVICES AND CONTINUALLY MODERNIZE THE CAL STAR SYSTEM EVEN INTO MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS. SO IF A THIRTY NINE COUNTY MIGRATION TO THE NEW SYSTEM WASN'T ENOUGH IN TANDEM WITH THAT WITH THE C. FOR MIGRATION CAL SAWS ALSO IMPLEMENTED IMPLEMENTED THE ENTIRELY NEW PUBLIC FACING PORTAL CALLED BENEFITS CAO. SO COUNCILS MULTI VENDOR STRATEGY SUCCESSFULLY SUPPORTED THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PORTAL MOBILE APPLICATION WHILE INTEGRATING THE EFFORT INTOTHE OVERALL CAL SADDAM MANAGEMENT AND RELEASED PLAN. THIS INCLUDED IN THE INTEGRATED PLAN- NEW IMAGING AND CENTRAL PRINT SERVICES WERE PROCURED AND BEGAN FOR THE SAME CAL SIZE COUNTIES. SO WHILE WE CELEBRATE YOU KNOW THESE MAJOR MILESTONES AND SUCCESSES TO DATE THIS PROJECT IS FAR FROM OVER- IN THE UPCOMING WEEKS WERE LOOKING FORWARD TO LA COUNTY'S MIGRATION TO BENEFITS CAL. AND THE IMAGING SERVICES ALLOWING FOR THE RETIREMENT OF YOUR BENEFITS NOW PORTAL. AND THE DEVELOPMENT IN ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE EFFORTS ARE REALLY NOW FOCUSING ON THE MIGRATION OF THE EIGHTEEN CALLIN COUNTIES BEGINNING LATE THIS BEGINNING LATE THIS YEAR AND A WAVE ROLLOUT. APPROACH COMPLETING BEFORE THE FEDERAL MANDATE AT THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE- THE STRATEGY STAGE THINGS CAUSAR COW WHEN COUNTY SLAS DUE TO THE ADDITIONAL COMPLEXITIES AND COUNTY IMPACTS FROM MIGRATING FROM CAL INTO CHAOS. SO AS YOU CAN SEE HERE AND SEE- FROM THE AGENT AT THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT IS ENORMOUS- BUT WE DO FILLED VERY BEING VERY WELL MANAGED AND REQUIREMENTS ARE BEING MET INCLUDING THE FEDERAL MANDATE WITHIN BUDGET AND SCHEDULE- THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN WITH PROJECTS OF THIS SIZE. ADJUSTMENTS TO BOTH BUDGET AND SCHEDULE- AS WE AS YOU LEARN AND GET THE ACTUALS OF THE LEVEL OF EFFORT AND THE COSTS THAT ARE REALIZED BUT AGAIN WE MANAGE PROACTIVELY AND WOOD COUNTY FOR EACH EAC YEAR'S BUDGET. WHEN I TURNED UP AT JOHN FOR SOME ADDITIONAL ANSWERS TO SPECIFIC QUESTIONS THANK YOU BRANDON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'M GLAD TO BE HERE TODAY MANY OF DETAILED QUESTIONS ON THE AGENDA SO I'M JUST GOING TO JUMP RIGHT INTO THOSE AND SORT OF WRK THROUGH IT. SO ONE OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS AS WE ROLLOUT CAL SAWS IS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW POLICY AND NEW INITIATIVES I KNOW THE COMMITTEE WANTED TO KNOW WHAT THE NATURE OF THE UP RELEASES FOR BOTH CAL SALAS AND BENEFITS CAL AND HOW DO THEY IMPACT PROGRAM ACCESS CUSTOMER FRIENDLY DESIGN LANGUAGE ACCESS. AND PROGRAM RETENTION. THERE'S A LOT OF NAY. GIMPLE IN THE LAST BUDGET SESSION. AND WE'VE MADE COMMITMENTS TO BE ABLE TO GET THOSE THINGS ON TIME AND ON BUDGET. FOR MAY WE'RE GONNA BE IMPLEMENTING THE MEDIC HOW OLDER ADULT EXPANSION- AND WE'RE ALSO GOING TO BE DOING THE EXPANSION OF THE CAL WORKS TIME CLOCKS FROM FORTY EIGHT MONTHS TO SIXTY MONTHS. AT THE SAME TIME WILL BE INCREASING THE CAL WORKS PRESIDENT PREGNANCY SPECIAL. NEEDS THAT IS THE ONLY FOR THE CALIFORNICUM LEGACY SYSTEM THAT CURRENTLY SUPPORTS EIGHTEEN COUNTIES. AS OF JUNE FIRST WILL BE INCREASING THE COW WORKS RECIPIENTS EARNED INCOME DISREGARD TWO SIX TWO SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS AS OUTLINED BY THE LEGISLATURE. AND FOR JULY FIRST WILL BE IMPLEMENTED THE INCREASE TO THE CAL CAL WORKS APPLICATION EARNED INCOME DISREGARD. WILL BE INCREASED WOOD THE INCREASE TO THE MEDIC CAL ASSET LIMITS AN IMPORTANT CHANGE FOR ACCESS. AND THE CHANGE ELIGIBILITY RULES FOR PREGNANT INDIVIDUALS AND CAL WORKS WILL ALSO BE IMPLEMENTED. ALL OF THESE CHANGES ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED ON TIME WITHIN THEIR LEGISLATIVE TARGET DATES AND THEY WILL EXPAND THE ACCESS AND SERVICES FOR THESE IMPORTANT INITIATIVES. FOR BENEFITS CAL WE'RE CURRENTLY WORKING ON SEVERAL VERY IMPORTANT INITIATIVES TO INCREASE SUPPORT FOR CALFRESH APPLICANTS AND THE SISTERS. THAT CDSS IS SUPPORTING WITH FEDERAL HARPER FINDING AND SECURING THAT FUNDING- FOR AUTOMATION AND FOR CALSONIC. THIS INCLUDES THE CREATION OF A VERSION OF BENEFITS CAL SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR CAUGHT THE COLLEGE STUDENT POPULATION. I'M HERE TO HELP ADDRESS SPECIFIC NEEDS AND CONCERNS RELATED TO FEDERAL STUDENT RULES AND OTHER COMMON SITUATIONS FOR OUR STUDENTS. WE'RE ALSO WORKING TO ADD FUNCTIONALITY TO SUPPORT APPLICATION THE SISTERS AND THEIR IMPORTANT ROLE AS THEY DO OUTREACH AND RETENTION WORK WITH THE PUBLIC- WITH THE ABILITY FOR CUSTOMERS TO AUTHORIZE SHARING. CERTAIN TYPES OF INFORMATION WITH THOSE WITH THOSE A SISTERS KNOWN AS A RELEASE OF INFORMATION. AND FOR CBO'S COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO GENERATE TRACKABLE CODES WITHIN BENEFITS CAL TO USED IN THEIR OUT REACH ALLOWING FOR TRACKING AND ANALYSIS OF OUTCOMES FOR VARIOUS OUTREACH CAMPAIGNS AND THEIR EFFECTIVENESS. WE'RE WORKING DILIGENTLY TO MAKE AS MANY OF THESE CHANGES AS POSSIBLE BY THE SEPTEMBER THE END OF THE FEDERAL FISCAL YEAR TO MEET THE TIME LINES- BEFORE THE USE OF THESE FUNDS. WITH REGARD TO LANGUAGE ACCESS AS WE LAUNCHED BENEFITS CAL WE LAUNCHED THE INITIAL- VERSION OF BENEFITS CALLIN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SUPPORTING TWELVE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES ON THE WEBSITE- THIS MONTH WILL ADD ANOTHER FIVE LANGUAGES TO THAT AND BY THE END OF MAY WE WILL ADD ANOTHER THREE SO HAVING TWENTY LANGUAGES TOTAL- SUPPORTED AS WE GO FORWARD. THE COMMITTEES NEXT QUESTION WAS REVIEW THE IMPLEMENTATION OF BENEFITS CAL DESCRIBE ANY ISSUES THAT WE CAME ACROSS ANY CHALLENGES AND WHAT THE PLANS ARE TO ADDRESS THOSE PROBLEMS. AND HOW DOES LOOKING THEN PIVOTING TO- DATA ON CASES SINCE THE IMPLEMENTATION COMPARE WITH DATA FROM A PRIOR PERIOD SO DO A LITTLE BIT OF A COMPARISON FROM A PRIOR PERIOD. BEFORE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF BENEFITS CALON CAL SAUCE FOR THE THIRTY NINE C. FOR COUNTIES AND COMPARE THAT SETS. I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT THE COLLABORATION ON BENEFITS CAL WITH OUR STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY ARE ADVOCATES ARE COUNTIES. OUR STATE PARTNERS HAS BEEN A SUCCESS IT'S AN INCREMENTAL SUCCESS OUR JOB IS IT DONE. BUT WITHIN THE FIRST FOUR MONTHS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF BENEFITS CAL WE HAD OVER A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND CUSTOMERS REGISTER FOR ACCOUNTS OVER EIGHT HUNDRED. EIGHT HUNDRED COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION REGISTERING FOR ACCOUNTS AND CLOSE TO A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND APPLICATIONS IN THE FIRST FOUR MONTHS. OF SUBMITTED FOR CALFRESH CAL WORKS AT MANTA CAL PERIOD WE'VE HAD OVER SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND VERIFICATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN UP LOADED INTO BENEFITS CAL. AND THEY'VE BEEN AND THEY'VE BEEN SUBMITTED AND ASSISTED IN THE VERIFICATION PROCESS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WORKED ON WITH- OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR PRIVATE PARTNERS IS A MOBILE FIRST DESIGN. KNOWING THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE USING MORE AND MORE MOBILE TECHNOLOGY TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE BENEFITS TRACK THEIR BENEFITS AND GET INFORMATION ON THE PROGRAMS. WE'RE HAPPY TO REPORT THAT 71% OF PEOPLE ARE USING MOBILE DEVICES SUCH AS SMARTPHONES IN ORDER ACCESS BENEFITS CAL AND THAT'S JUST FOR THE THIRTY NINE COUNTIES. ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR FEATURES OF BENEFITS CAL THE ABILITY FOR INDIVIDUALS TO CHECK THEIR EBT BALANCES. AT ABOUT SIXTY FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE PER DAY ARE ACCESSING BENEFITS CAL TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THEIR EBT BALANCES AND TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE THEIR FINANCES. WELL BENEFITS CAL HAS BEEN SIX RUSSELL WE HAVE RUN INTO SOME TECHNOLOGY STABILITY AND PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS AND ISSUES. WITH THE KELSALL IMAGING SOLUTIONS THE NEW- CLOUDBASE IMAGING SOLUTION THAT DEPUTY DIRECTOR CANCER SPOKE OF- WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH% OUR TECHNOLOGY PARTNER HIGHLAND TECHNOLOGIES TO RESOLVE THESE ISSUES. BECAUSE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE HAD WITH THE IMAGING SOLUTION AND IT'S VERY VERY TIGHTLY COUPLED. WITH BENEFITS CAL THEY HAVE TO BE IMPLEMENTED HAND IN HAND- THAT WE DID DELAY L. A. COUNTY. AND OPTED TO DO MORE PERFORMANCE TESTING STABILITY TESTING AND THOSE TYPES OF THINGS WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE WEEKS AWAY FROM IMPLEMENTING BOLD BENEFITS CAL AND THE NEW IMAGING SOLUTION. IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY THAT WE'VE GOTTEN THAT STABILITY THAT WE'VE GOTTEN THAT PERFORMANCE AS WE SPEAK THERE IS TESTING GOING ON RIGHT NOW. AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A FACT BASED APPROACH AND LET THE TESTING AND PERFORMANCE REALLY DRIVE THAT DATE BECAUSE- THE CUSTOMERS DESERVE THAT AND ARE COUNTIES DESERVE THAT. SORT OF SWITCHING GEARS WITH REGARD TO THE DATA QUESTION ASKED BY THE COMMITTEE WE COMPARE THE DATA FOR THIRTY NINE FORMER C. FOR COUNTIES. FOR OCTOBER OF TWENTY TWENTY THROUGH FEBRUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WITH OCTOBER IT WILL F. OCTOBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE THROUGH FEBRUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO FOUR IMPORTANT THINGS SUCH AS- ADMINISTRATIVE OR PROCEDURAL THE NILES WHICH ARE THE DENIALS FOR REASONS LIKE NOT PROVIDING A VERIFICATION OR NOT COMPLETING AN INTERVIEW- IF REQUIRED. AND THAT'S SUPPOSED TO ELIGIBILITY FACTORS LIKE BEING OVER INCOME. WE FOUND BETWEEN THE TWO YEARS FOR THOSE THIRTY NINE COUNTY IS- THAT THE DATE DATE WAS ACTUALLY FAIRLY CONSISTENT- FOR THOSE YEARS- THE CAL WORKS RATE INCREASED SLIGHTLY FROM 28230% THE CALIBRATED EIGHT CONSISTENT AT 27% FOR BOTH YEARS IN THE MEDICAL RATE DID DECREASE FROM. REALLY UNPACK OR INVESTIGATE THE REASONS FOR THE LOWER MEDIC CAL RATES COMPARED TO THE OTHER PROGRAMS BUT SUSPECT IT'S LIKELY DUE TO THE DIFFERING PROGRAM RULES INCLUDE INCLUDING- GREATER USE OF ELECTRONIC VERIFICATION SOURCE VERIFICATION THROUGH OUR FEDERAL VERIFICATION- FOR TIMELY DETERMINATIONS OF CAL WORKS. FOR DETERMINATIONS THE CAL WORKS RATE WENT FROM 98% ON THIS TIME PERIOD. TO NINETY TWO PERCENT. THE CALFRESH RATE WENT FROM EIGHTY SEVEN PERCENT. 79% AND A MEDIC CAL RATE WENT FROM 74% TO SEVENTY SIX PERCENT. AGAIN WE HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO UNPACK THE REASON FOR THE- LARGER DECREASE IN THE CALCIFIED IN THE CALIBRATION NUMBER. BUT SUSPECT IT'S LIKELY DUE TO A COMBINATION OF INCREASES IN APPLICATIONS YEAR OVER YEAR APPLICATIONS INCREASED BY MORE THAN 15% DURING THE PANDEMIC. AND SOME ISSUES THAT C. W. D. A. HAS BROUGHT UP IN THE PAST THAT THE METHODOLOGY FOR FUNDING CALFRESH ADMINISTRATIVE FUNDS IS A TWENTY YEAR OLD PROCESS THAT HAS NOT BEEN- LOOKED AT AND OVER TWENTY YEARS AND THERE'S- UNDER FUNDING THAT'S TAKING PLACE ON THAT. WE ALSO THINK THAT THE IMPACT OF THE OMICRON SURGE ON OUR COUNTY WORKFORCE HAD AN IMPACT. AND THAT WHEN WE REALLY LOOK AT THAT YEAH ON- JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO MAY HAVE BEEN A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO LOWERED LOWER NUMBERS AS WELL. NOW FOR MEDIC CAL. COUNTIES HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY IN REGARDS TO APPLICATION PROCESSING TIME LINE SO THEY CAN WORK WITH CUSTOMERS WHO NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME- TO BE ABLE TO GET THE NECESSARY INFORMATION IT REALLY IS A DIFFERENTIATED IN THE DATA. BUT IT LIKELY CONTRIBUTES TO GENERALLY THE LOWER RATE MEDIC CAL VERSES THE CALFRESH AND CAL WORKS PROGRAM. WE FOUND LITTLE CHANGE IN THE RATE OF APPLICATION DENIALS. THAT WERE RESCINDED- WITH CAL WORK STAY IN AT 8% CALIFORNIA'S GOING FROM 6% IMPORTANT NO ONE WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS AND DOING THE RESEARCH ON THIS DATA. THAT NOT ONLY DID THE COUNTIES MOVED FROM. C. FOR THE OLD LEGACY SYSTEM TO CAL SANTIAGO. BUT ALSO THEY ARE DOING THAT AT THE SAME TIME OF THE PANDEMIC. IT'S ECONOMIC DISRUPTIONS AT THE SAME TIME ITS WORK FORCE IN LOCATIONS MANY THE COUNTIES WERE WORKING REMOTE DURING THOSE TIMES. EDUCATIONS AND THEN THE SUSPENSION OF SOME OF THE MITIGATIONS OF LIKE- THE- PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND OTHER RELIEFS DURING THAT TIME. GOING ON TO THE OTHER QUESTION HOW DOES THE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESS FOR CAL SOUTH COMPARE WITH THAT OF SIMILAR PROJECTS. ALSO WHEN WE LOOK AT BENEFITS CALENDAR PUBLIC FACING TECHNOLOGY ARE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESS IS- SO IMPORTANT TO US IT'S BEEN A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF OUR SUCCESS. AND THE COLLABORATION THAT WE'VE HAD. HAVING WORKED AROUND- HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES TECHNOLOGY SINCE NINETEEN NINETY NINE AND CALIFORNIA AS A CONSULTANT. AS A MANAGER WITH AND- COUNTY ORGANIZATIONS AND FOR FOUR YEARS AS THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF SYSTEMS INTEGRATION I HAVE TO SAY FOR CAL SAWS THIS IS THE MOST ROBUST IN. STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESS THAT I'VE EVER BEEN INVOLVED IN AND IT'S PAID DIVIDENDS. NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE A VARIETY OF MONTHLY AND QUARTERLY STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS TO PROVIDE STAKEHOLDERS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE INPUT. AND ACTUALLY TEST PUBLIC FACING TECHNOLOGIES BUT WE ALSO MAINTAIN. A VERY EXTENSIVE WEBSITE WITH INFORMATION ON PROJECT ACTIVITIES ARE CHANGES OUR MEETINGS AND WE HAVE A FUNCTION TO BE ABLE TO HAVE TWO WAY CONVERSATIONS CALLED PASCAL SAWS WHERE SOMEBODY COULD ASK A FEW QUESTIONS AND WE WILL TURN THAT AROUND. ALSO AT THE JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY- ED MADE UP OF OUR FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES- OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS MEETING AS A PUBLIC MEETING GOVERNED BY THE BROWN ACT- ARE PROJECT STEERING COMMITTEE IS A PUBLIC MEETING GOVERNED BY THE BROWN ACT AS WELL AS- OUR- HOPEFULLY SOON TO BE. LEGACY SYSTEM CAL WHEN. THEIR GOVERNING BOARD IS ALSO A PUBLIC MEETINGS WE PROVIDE TIME. FOR PUBLIC COMMENT FOR POSTING AND FOR INTERACTION. THE LAST QUESTION I THINK- DEPUTY DIRECTOR HANSARD ANSWERED VERY WELL AND I JUST WANT TO CONFIRM WE ARE ON TRACK THIS IS A CHALLENGING IMPLEMENTATION. THERE'S MANY MOVING PARTS TO THIS- NO ONE WOULD HAVE PREDICTED THE PANDEMIC WHAT THAT WOULD DO TO OUR WORKFORCE WHAT THAT WOULD DO TO OUR COMMUNITY IS WERE ACTIVELY MONITORING THE PROGRESS REMAIN FOR THE CHANGES TO PREPARE FOR THE MIGRATION OF OUR EIGHTEEN COUNTIES. REPRESENT ASSISTANCE CASELOAD IN THOSE EIGHTEEN COUNTY SO WE STILL HAVE A WAYS TO GO. WE'RE WORKING WITH THOSE EIGHTEEN CAL WHEN COUNTIES WE HAVE A VENDOR SUPPORTING THEM DOING THE CHANGE PROCESS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE CHANGE IN TECHNOLOGY IS GOING TO HAVE A CHANGE OF BUSINESS PROCESS AND MAPPING OUT THAT CHANGE IN BUSINESS PROCESS. WE'RE LOOKING AG PROVIDING THEM WITH MORE EXTENSIVE TRAINING FOR THE- FOR THE- ELIGIBILITY WORKERS. SINCE THE CHANGE FROM CALNGUYEN TO CAL SAWS IS A MUCH BIGGER CHANGE SEE FOR AND THE FORMER L. ARRESTS ARE NOW CAL SAUCES WERE COUSIN SYSTEMS OF ONE ANOTHER. THERE WAS MANY SIMILARITIES- THERE'S GONNA BE MUCH MORE ROBUST TRAINING. THIS WORK. THE OUTLINED IN ADDITION TO THE POLICY COMMITMENTS WE'VE MADE DURING LAST YEAR'S BUDGET SESSION. OBVIOUSLY HAVE THEIR PLACE VERY VERY FULL. AND WE ALREADY HAVE JUST TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT OUR OUR PLATE IS VERY VERY FULL- AND YOU KNOW ADDITIONAL POLICY COMMITMENTS WILL HAVE TO YOU KNOW REALLY LOOK AT PRIOR TO YOU KNOW MID TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TIME FRAME. BUT WILL BE WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ARE COUNTIES IN THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE REALISTIC TYPE- THE TIME FRAMES FOR IMPLEMENTATION AS MR HERALD OUTLINED IN THE LAST- LAST ISSUE THAT WAS DISCUSSED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXTERA JOHNNO HENYON IF THEY'RE GOING TO PRESENT. I GET AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME PRESENT MY NAME'S JOHN CHIANG AND I'M THE FIRST CHIEF DATA OFFICER FOR ULTIMATE SERVICES I WAS BROUGHT ON BOARD TO STAND UP THE CENTER FOR DATA INSIGHTS AND INNOVATION- THERE'S FOUR QUESTIONS I HAD TO PRIOR INTO THE- TO POP UP TODAY AND SO ALL DRESSED. MAYBE GIVING YOU A QUICK OVERVIEW OF CDS THE CENTER FOR DATA INSIDE HM. HI THE ENACTMENT OF TRAILER BILL ONE SEVENTY TWO SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO FOR ABOUT SIX MONTHS OLD- CREATED CD I WHICH WILL HAVE A MERGER OF EXISTING OFFICES THE OFFICE OF HEALTH INFORMATION INTEGRITY THE OFFICE OF ASIAN ADVOCATE. PUTS THAT UP SUBJECTS WHICH IS STATE IRB. AS WELL AS THE OFFICE OF INNOVATION AND REALLY THE IDEA WAS HOW DO WE BRING THESE OFFICE IS THAT ACTUALLY CAN LEVERAGE EACH OTHER TO DRIVE THE AGENCY'S MISSION- TO FOCUS ON EQUITY. TO DRIVE THE TAP DATA DRIVE ACTION AND TO PUT THE PERSON BACK INTO HUMAN. CENTERED DESIGN- WHILE CREATING A CULTURE OF INNOVATION AND LEARNING. HI IT'S- WHAT I CAN HELP GO TO QUESTION NUMBER TWO IN TERMS OF WHAT CAN ACTION WE HAVE RIGHT NOW- WE HAVE. THERE ISN'T A- DETAIL K. BUT WHAT WE'VE DOING WORKING BUT THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES. AS AS ALL OF THE- ALL THE DEPARTMENTS WITHIN CAL HHS. IS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE AS A AS- WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF DATA PROFESSIONALS AND OUR AGENCY. AND WE HAVE NUMEROUS DATA PROJECTS AND A LOT OF THEM NOWADAYS WE'RE TRYING TO DETERMINE- HOW INDIVIDUALS IMPACTED. HOW TO USE DATA TO DRIVE ACTION IT REQUIRES DATA FROM DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS TO COME TOGETHER- BEFORE MY IME WE HAD A VERY- ROBUST DATA COMMUNITY THAT GOT TOGETHER AND SHE DID A NUMBER OF PROJECTS- I LIKE THE PROGRAM DASHBOARD WHICH LOOKED AT INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE SERVED BY MULTIPLE PROGRAMS. BOTH WITHIN A DEPARTMENT BUT ALSO ACROSS THE AGENCY. AND OUR JOB RIGHT NOW IS TO TAKE THAT RESEARCH DATA UP AND TAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL AND MAKE IT MORE OF AN OPERATIONAL CAPACITY. TO BE ABLE TO DRIVE- EFFORTS LIKE THE EQUITY TOWARD WHICH WE WERE TASKED WITH THIS YEAR AS WELL AS THE ALL HAZARDS DASHBOARD AND NUMBER OF OTHER PROJECTS. WITH RESPECT TO CDS THAT'S- ALWAYS GONNA READ FOR HERE IT BE EASIER- WELL SEE I UNDERTAKES MANY OF THE INITIATIVES DESCRIBED- WE ALSO CONSULT AND COLLABORATE WITH APARTMENTS ON DATA SPECIFIC INITIATIVES THAT THEY HAVE UNDER WAY. WE DON'T DIRECTLY OVERSEE OR MANAGE THE DEPARTMENT'S DATA PROJECTS BUT WE DO WORK WITH ANUMBER OF DEPARTMENTS FOR EXAMPLE WITH DSS- THE DATA PIPELINES FOR THE ALL HAZARDS DASHBOARD CDSS IS CURRENTLY PROVIDING DATA ON LICENSE FACILITIES CALFRESH RECIPIENTS IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES- WITH RESPECT TO AB TWENTY EIGHTY THREE. ENGAGEMENT AND DATA LINKAGE TO SUPPORT BOTH CDSS THE H. THE SDDS AND THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ARE PROVIDING DATA AND CDI IS THE FACILITATOR OF DATA SHARING THE- WHAT WE'RE CREATING CALL. THE AGENCY DATA HUB- IN ADDITION RESPECT TO THE HOMELESS DATA. INTEGRATION SYSTEM H. D. I. S. C. I. IS IN EARLY DISCUSSIONS- TOWARDS TDI FACILITATING THE ACCESS TO THE H. D. I. S. DATA FOR BOTH CDS PASS. AND LINK IT WITH OTHER KELLY TOUCH S. PROGRAMS- OUR EVALUATING SUCCESS WILL WE ARE START UP BUT IN MANY WAYS WE HAVE A NUMBER OF PROJECTS THAT WERE ACTUALLY SHEPHERDING THAT HAVE BEEN- HAPPENING OVER AT THE CALLIE JUDGE US DATA JOURNEY WHICH WE TRACE BACK TO TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS AND REALLY BUILDING ON THAT- WE HAVE A- REPORT THAT WAS DUE MARCH FIRST WILL HAVE IT TO YOU BY THE END OF NEXT WEEK- WE'VE BEEN. WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IT IT ENTAILS AND GIVE THEM ANOTHER- I'M MORE DETAILED APPROACH BOOK BURKE WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON- I THINK THE TOP AREAS- FROM YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT DATA BUT I'LL HAVE TO TALK ABOUT PEOPLE AND WHO'S IMPACTED. OUR NUMBER NUMBER. NUMBER OF INITIATIVES IS IMPROVING THE SPEED OF SERVICE WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF RESEARCH REQUESTS THAT COME TO THE- STATE. AND UNDER OUR NEW TRAILER BILL WE ARE NOT ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR RESEARCH REQUEST THE COM- TO THE COMMITTEE FOR PRE PRODUCTION IN HUMAN SUBJECTS WHICH IS OUR HIGHER BE. UP FOR THE STATE IS NOT ONLY CALLIE TAKE US REQUEST FOR THAT BUT- THEY CAN COME FROM ALL OVER THE STATE. SO WITH THIS TRAILER BILL WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW TO SPEED UP THE REQUEST FROM THE TIME THAT A RESEARCH REQUEST THAT DATA. AND PROVIDING MECHANISMS THAT MORE AUTOMATE DATA DATA REQUEST- AND AS WELL AS PROVIDING OPPORTUNITY FOR RESEARCHERS TO IDENTIFY WHAT OTHER DATA IS BEING REQUESTED OF AN UPPER RESEARCHER COMES IN FOR THE FIRST TIME. IT WOULD BE REALLY CRITICAL THAT RESEARCHER TO KNOW WAS THAT DATE ALREADY REQUESTED FROM OTHER RESEARCHERS IS THERE MORE. OUT THERE AND SO REALLY PROVIDING A FIRST CLASS EXPERIENCE- FOR RESEARCHERS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT THEIR WORK REALLY ELEVATES THE WORK FOR ALL DOING. I ALL OF ALL RESERVE- ANY OTHER TIME IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM BRIAN SELECT RESEARCH AUTOMATION AND DATA DIVISION CHIEF DATA OFFICER. WITH CDSS. THERE ARE MANY STRANGE LET I AM THE CHIEF DATA OFFICER AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR OVER THE RESEARCH AUTOMATION AND DATA DIVISION I'M I'VE BEEN ASKED TODAY TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE STATEWIDE VERIFICATION HUB AND OTHER MAJOR PROJECTS THAT RAT IS WORKING ON THAT AFFECTS THE LARGEST. ANTI POVERTY PROGRAMS IN THE STATE. TO START OFF WITH THE STATEWIDE VERIFICATION IT'S A MULTI DEPARTMENT. IT SOLUTION CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT THAT WILL IMPROVE FAMILIES ACCESS TO SERVICES BY STREAMLINING THE ELIGIBILITY VERIFICATION PROCESS FOR MANY MEANS TESTED PROGRAMS. IN PARTICULAR HOW FRESH HOW IT WORKS. MEDIKAL IN CHILD CARE PROGRAMS. UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM THE VERIFICATION PROCESS FOR PUBLICASSISTANCE PROGRAMS ARE SUPPORTED BY MULTIPLE LEGACY IT SYSTEMS. THERE IS A BROAD VERY ABILITY AND POLICY OPERATION AND TECHNOLOGY PROSCAR GRANTS IN CONTE'S. MANY CROSSES THESE ARE HIGHLY MANUAL AND REPETITIVE IT RELY ON TIME CONSUMING PAPER BASED APPROACHES TO VERIFICATION. S. B. H. GAINES TO RIP ADDRESS THE ESPY CREEMOS CENTRALIZED. HUB THAT WILL STREAMLINE ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION. THIS WILL BENEFIT PROGRAM CLIENTS BY IMPROVING THE SPEED OF VERIFICATION ELIGIBILITY WORKERS BY PROVIDING ACCESS TO NEAR REAL TIME VERIFICATION AND PROCESS SIMPLIFICATION. M. STATE BY IMPROVING DATA SECURITY AND REPORTING CAPABILITIES. SB WHICH WILL FOCUS ON TWO DIFFERENT VERIFICATION. TWO DIFFERENT STEPS IN THE VERIFICATION PROCESS. THE FIRST IS INITIAL VERIFICATION OF ELIGIBILITY WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL APPLIES FOR BENEFITS AND THE SECOND IS THE ONGOING VERIFICATION WE-DETERMINATION GREENWALD AND RE CERTIFICATION. INITIALLY AS I MENTIONED THE FOCUS WILL BE ON HOW WORKS CALFRESH MEDI CAL IN CHILD CARE PROGRAMS BUT OVER TIME THE GOAL IS FOR SB H. TO BECOME THE SINGLE SOURCE OF CUSTOMER VERIFICATION INFORMATION FOR PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE. AS A RESULT AS USUAL INTERFACE CLOSELY WITH ALL SIDES AND OTHER ELIGIBILITY VERIFICATION SYSTEMS BUT WILL REMAIN A STANDALONE SOLUTION TO ENABLE BETTER FUTURE CONNECTIONS TO OTHER ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WHILE S. B. H. WILL SIGNIFICANTLY STREAMLINE ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION IT WILL NOT SERVE AS A CENTRALIZED APPLICATION SYSTEM. CLIENTS WILL STILL NEED TO APPLY FOR INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS ALTHOUGH THE ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION PROCESS SHOULD BE MUCH FASTER AND EASIER ONCE AN INDIVIDUAL HAS ALREADY APPLIED FOR ONE PROGRAM. AS S. B. H. WILL ALLOW ACCESS TO DOCUMENTS AND OTHER VERIFICATIONS THAT I'VE ALREADY BEEN SUBMITTED. THE PROJECT IS CURRENTLY IN BUSINESS DISCOVERY PHASE AND WE ARE ENGAGING WITH STAKEHOLDERS ARE WE ARE ENGAGING IN STAKEHOLDER SESSIONS WITH COUNTIES TO UNDERSTAND THEIR NEEDS AND- YOU STATES. ARE TARGET FOR GO LIVE IS JULY TWENTY TWENTY FOR. INSTANCE OF COURSE ON EVERYTHING CONTINUING TO MOVE SMOOTHLY WITH THE COW SIZE FIFTY EIGHT.

LIFECYCLE PROCESS THAT IS INTENDED TO BE- REQUESTED IN FUTURE SESSIONS. I'M GONNA MOVE ON NOW TO SOME OF THE OTHER PROJECTS THAT ROUTE HAS BEEN WORKING ON. ROBERTS CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES INFORMATION SERVICES DIVISION TEAM AND- SITES DELIVER SEVERAL OTHER AUTOMATION INITIATIVES AFFECTING MAJOR ANY PROPERTY PROGRAMS IF YOU THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDE. EARLY BEGINNINGS OF THE SHIP REALLY BEGINNING SINCE THE SERIES OF TECHNOLOGY PROJECTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPED TO CREATE UNDER DEVELOPMENT TO CREATE A NEW CHILD CARE DATA INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WILL FACILITATE A BETTER FLOW OF DATA- PROGRAMS. THIS INCLUDES CAL SPARK WHICH WILL SERVE AS A STREAMLINING AT THE DATA SYSTEMS AND BUSINESS PROCESSESTHE GOVERNMENT LEVEL OF INFORMATION BETWEEN FAMILIES PROVIDERS. STATE OFFICIALS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. IT WILL ALSO INCLUDE A CONSUMER EDUCATION PORTAL WHICH IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF WEB BASED PORTAL TO PROVIDE FAMILIES WITH BETTER INFORMATION ABOUT. PROVIDER FEATURES AVAILABILITY. FINALLY THE EARLY CHILDHOOD INTEGRATED DATA SYSTEM WHICH WILL COMBINE INFORMATION EARLY CHILDHOOD PASTA BERMAN CELTIC BETTER LEARNING OPERATIONS. THESE PRODUCTS ARE ALL EARLY DEVELOPMENT STAGES IN RAD SERVES AS A PRODUCT SPONSOR STRATEGIC VISION OF THE OVERALL BEGINS NEXT. IN ADDITION TO BILLY BEGINNINGS RAD- HAS BEEN HEAVILY INVOLVED IN THE BENEFITS CAL PROJECT I KNOW WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THAT ALREADY SO I WON'T SPEND TOO MUCH MORE TIME DISCUSSING THAT- BUT REID HAS BEEN WRAPPED HAS BEEN. PROJECT AND SERVED AS A LIAISON BETWEEN ALL PROGRAM PARTNERS IN CALCITE BENEFITS CALIPER DESIGN DEVELOPMENT TESTING IMPLEMENTATION. SIMILARLY WITH OUR ORDER- BRAD HAS- HELP- IS SERVED AS THE PROJECT SPONSOR IN ITS HELPED DESIGN THE ORIGINAL VISION IT REDUCES THE PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT GO INTO- THE COLOR TOUCH BOARD.

AB DE IS PLACE TO DRAW ON THE AND PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY RESPONSE OR THE PAST TWO YEARS AND IT'S HAD A NUMBER OF MAJOR PROJECTS IN THE WORKS AS WELL. ET AND THE CALIFORNIA EBT FRUIT THAT YOU PILOT INCREASE CARD SECURITY MEASURES. I WAS NOT HAPPY TAKE QUESTIONS LATER. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM CYNTHIA TOCAR WHO IS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR CHILD WELFARE DIGITAL SERVICES AT THE OFFICE OF SYSTEMS INTEGRATION AKALI TRADE JUST. THANK YOU SO MUCH SHERMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- I'VE BEEN ASKED TO PROVIDE A LITTLE INFORMATION ON THE CARRIAGE PROJECT WHERE WE ARE COST SCHEDULE SCOPE XTERRA. SO I'M GONNA GO RIGHT INTO IT AND THEN WE CAN HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR MIGHT BE. THE SCOPE OF THE CHILD WELFARE SERVICES- CALIFORNIA AUTOMATED RESPONSE AND ENGAGEMENT SYSTEM WHICH WE CALL CTS CARES IS THE FOCUS IS TO REPLACE OUR EXISTING- CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM ALSO KNOWN AS THE CHILD WELFARE SERVICES CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM- THE PROJECT IS FOCUSED ON BUILDING A CHILD WELFARE INFORMATION SYSTEM THAT. MEETS THE CHILD WELFARE WORKER NEEDS ON A DAILY BASIS SUPPORTS TODAY'S BEST PRACTICES INCLUDING PROGRAM PRACTICES AND MOST IMPORTANTLY RESULTS. IN IMPROVED OUTCOMES FOR CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN. THE DELIVERY OF CARE FOR FALLING TO MAJOR RELEASES VERSION ONE AND VERSION TWO. VERSION ONE COVERS THE FUNCTIONALITY REQUIRED TO REPLACE THE EXISTING SYSTEM- WHICH AND SUPPORT NEW POLICIES AND PROGRAMS- THAT EXISTING SYSTEM DOES NOT SUPPORT. AND IT'S ALSO LOOKING TO LAY OUR FOUNDATION FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE FEDERAL COMPREHENSIVE CHILD WELFARE INFORMATION SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS- THE V. VERSION ONE WILL ENABLE THAT THOSE CORE CHILD WELFARE AT PIECES OF WORK YOU KNOW FOR INTEGRA ELIGIBILITY COURTS WORK ALL OF THE INDEPENDENT DAY TO DAY WORK THAT THEY DO. VERSION TWO LOOKS TO EXPAND THAT VERSION ONE FUNCTIONALITY AND PROVIDES AN EXTENDED CAPABILITIES- AND IMPLEMENTED- SOME FEDERALLY REQUIRED DATA EXCHANGES AS WELL AS- SEVEN EXISTING EXCHANGES FROM BETWEEN THE STAFF STATE SYSTEMS. ARE THE CURRENT SCHEDULE FOR VERSION ONE IS FOR IMPLEMENTATION TO COMPLETE AND MAY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. AND BASED ON LESSONS- THAT WE'VE LEARNED OVER- I WOULD SAY THE LAST YEAR AND WITH THE DEMONSTRATION MODUL DEMONSTRATION MODULE THAT WE- IMPLEMENTED TO FIVE COUNTIES- AB WE'RE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH OUR INDEPENDENT ADVISER TO DETERMINE WHAT- CHANGES. THERE MAY NEED TO BE TO THE OVERALL PROJECT TIME LINE WHICH SHOULD BE SUBMITTED LATER THIS YEAR AND SPECIAL PROJECTS. SIX THE CURRENT ESTIMATED TOTAL PROJECT BUDGET HAS NOT CHANGED SINCE THE SPR PROVED IN- SPRING OUT OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND IS STILL SITTING AT AS THE OVERALL PROJECT- COST OF NINE HUNDRED ELEVEN MILLION AND THIS DOES INCLUDE THE- STABILIZATION AS WELL AS BELIEVE IT'S ROUGHLY IN NINE MONTHS EIGHT OR NINE MONTHS- C. WEST REVIEW PERIOD WHICH EXTENDS THAT. THE TIME FRAME- AND I BELIEVE THAT'S IT DO WE HAVE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS. I WILL ADDRESS ALL QUESTIONS AT THE END OF THAT'S OKAY WE'LL GET THROUGH THE PANEL- NEXT WILL HAVE JESSICA- ZHOU CHIEF. CHIEF WELFARE SYSTEMS BRANCH CHIEF AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. THANK YOU TERM AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS- MY NAME'S JESSICA RIZZO I AM NOT THAT CHEAP THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM BRANCH AND THE EXECUTIVE SPONSOR REPRESENTATIVE FOR CHILD WELFARE TECHNICAL SERVICES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. WHEN ASKED TODAY TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE FUNCTIONALITIES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED FOR MAJOR PARTS THAT THE CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM AND WHAT'S ON THE HORIZON FOR FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION. SUPPRESSED OFF I HAVEN'T TO DATE WE HAVE RELEASED TWO KEY PRODUCTS THAT SUPPORT KEY ELEMENTS IN THE CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM. THEIR FIRST CHILD AND ADOLESCENT NEEDS AND STRENGTHS ASSESSMENT KNOWN AS PICKING ARMS TOOL- WE RELEASED THAT THANKS NOW ALREADY IN OUR ENVIRONMENT CULTURE TOOK. LIVE INITIALLY IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN WITH TWO SUBSEQUENT RELEASES AFTERWARDS. AND IT'S AND IT'S BENEFIT WHITE USAGE SINCE CHEN AT TWENTY NINETEEN. AT A LOSS FOR DIRECT ENTRY AT THESE CHILD AND ADOLESCENT NEEDS ASSESSMENTS AND- BURN YOU CAN CARE AND IT BE INITIAL ECCENTRIC SIXTY DAYS. TO QUIT EVERY SIX MONTHS THEREAFTER. FOR CHILD WELFARE AND THEIR CRITICAL PARTNERS- THIS INFORMATION IS USED FOR COORDINATION OF CARE FOR YOU. BETWEEN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH EDUCATION CHILD WELFARE ANOTHER KEY PARTNERS. AND ALSO SUPPORTS OUR PUBLIC CARE PROTOCOL- AND WHICH ELEMENTS THAT KILLED THAT PICKED HIM UP CARE. IN FEBRUARY OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO WE ALSO RELEASED OUR PROOF OF CONCEPT AND I IN THE CWS. DEVELOPMENT AND WE RECORDED IT SPRINGFIELD. YEAH IT IS ACTUALLY IT'S AN ADDITIONAL TOOL THAT ALLOWS FOR THE APPLICATION SUBMISSION REVIEW AND APPROVAL I'VE RESOURCE FAMILIES. AND THAT IS A KEY ELEMENT OF CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM TO SUPPORT EXPANDED FAMILY BASED CARE. AND THE REDUCTION OF CONGREGATE CARE. THIS IS JUST THE VERY FIRST PIECE FUNCTIONAL FOR THE RESOURCE PER PROCESS AND FULL FOR. BOARD REMAINING WILL BE RELEASED WITH ONE OF CARE- WE- PLEASE. THAT WE ARE PARTNERING WITH STATE POLICY AND PROGRAM STAFF AND COOK COUNTY AND TRIBAL REPRESENTATIVES TO JOINTLY IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL NEEDS FOR AUTOMATION SOLUTIONS AND THEY HAVE TO MEET THE OBJECTIVES THAT C. C. R. AND CARES BUT WE HAVE SEVERAL. I THINK KEY FEATURES THAT WE HIGHLIGHT HER VERSION ONE AND VERSION TWO THAT ARE ALREADY. PLANT INITIALLY IT WE WILL HAVE ENHANCED FEATURES FOR CANCER REPORTING IN PERSON ONE THAT WILL ALLOW THE ABILITY FOR ADDITIONAL PARTNERS AND DIRECT ENTRY AND DATA EXCHANGE WITH MENTAL HEALTH PARTNERS. WE WILL HAVE A PLACEMENT MATCHING DIRECTORY THAT ALLOWS FOR MORE DETAILED CHILD PLACEMENT MATCHING AND SUPPORT TO FIND THE BEST PLACEMENTS POSSIBLE. THERE WILL BE AN INITIAL FUNCTIONALITY AND BE ONE AND WE AND WE- PLAN FOR OUR ENHANCED FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY TO EXPAND OVER TIME IN PERSON TO GO. ADDITIONALLY WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT MORE ROBUST AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SERVICES AROUND ALL THE DIFFERENT PLACEMENT TYPES INCLUDING STR T. P.'S. THIS WILL SUPPORT PROVIDER DIRECTORIES. PROVIDER ACCREDITATION MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM APPROVALS MEDICAL CERTIFICATION WILL ALSO BE LOOKING AT B. EDITION OF ADDITIONAL- LICENSING TYPES SUCH AS TEMPORARY AND TRANSITIONAL SHELTERS. IN THAT DIRECTORY AND WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT OUR YOU ARE TEACHING FACILITIES. WITH THE DOCUMENTATION AROUND BE QUALIFIED INDIVIDUAL ACCREDITATION AT BASIC COURT INFORMATION AND ENSURES COMPLIANCE WITH. THE FAMILIES FIRST PREVENTIVE SERVICES ACT AND SUPPORTING AFTER CARE. THIS IS GONNA BE FOCUSED ON YOUTH STEPPING DOWN COM AT CARE ACT IT CONGREGATE CARE INTO A LOWER LEVELS OF KERR WITH WRAPAROUND SUPPORT SERVICES. WILL ALSO BE SUPPORTING. AT ALL OF THE NEW RATE CAPS- CAR CARE REFORM. AND IT'S AT IN PERSON TO WE ADVANCE WE ANTICIPATE MORE ADVANCED FEATURES INCLUDING MORE I REQUEST DATA EXCHANGES AND ALLOWING FOR DIRECT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR COMPLEX CARE TO SUPPORT AB TWENTY EIGHTY THREE SYSTEM. WORK AND ADVANCED ANALYTICS AND REPORTING TOOLS THAT WILL ALLOW FOR MUCH MORE DETAILED LONGITUDINAL EXAMINATION OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES AS WELL AS SYSTEMIC ANALYSIS OUR SYSTEM AND SERVICE RIGHT. AND I BELIEVE THAT IS ALL I HAVE IN THIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM JENNIFER TRACY WHO IS THE CAL SAWS ADVOCATES CO LEAD WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION. OF FOOD BANKS THANK YOU I THINK THAT MY NAME IS JENNIFER TRACY I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO REPRESENT CONSUMER NEEDS TODAY. FOR MY FIRST QUESTION ABOUT CONCRETE STRATEGIES FOR THE THAT THE STATE CAN TAKE ABOUT ENSURING ACCESS TO BENEFITS THERE'S THREE MAIN AREAS THAT WE LOOK AT- ACCESSIBILITY RESOURCES AND DIGITAL EQUITY SO IN TERMS OF ACCESSIBILITY- WERE PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN AND LANGUAGE ACCESS WE KNOW FROM THE STATE'S RESEARCH THAT LANGUAGE ACCESSIBILITY AS ONE OF THEM. ONE OF THE MAIN- FACTORS IN IT WHETHER OR NOT SOMEONE CAN ACCESS BENEFITS SO MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS INVESTMENTS FROM THE STATE LEVEL AND TRANSLATION SERVICES AND SUPPORTING INTERPRETATION AT THAT. MORE AT THE GROUND LEVEL- AND HAVING COMMUNITY REVIEW OF THOSE TRANSLATIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING THEM ACTUALLY MAKES SENSE THE FOLKS ON THE GROUND THAT ARE READING THEM- I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SEE. IF WITH BENEFITS PAL THAT AS MUCH AS IT'S REALLY GREAT THAT THE WEBSITE IS TRANSLATED INTO THE THRESHOLD LANGUAGES WE WANT PEOPLE TO ALSO BE ABLE TO AND PUT THEIR DATA. IN THEIR OWN LANGUAGE AS WELL SO MOVING TOWARDS A WAY OF FINDING A WAY FOR THAT SOLUTION TO BE INTEGRATED INTO BENEFITS CAL. IN TERMS OF RESOURCES- WE KNOW THAT THE COUNTIES HAVE BEEN- PUTTING IN HER OUTLOOK EFFORTS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THEIR COMMUNITIES AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE RESOURCES LOOKING AT THAT. TWENTY YEAR OLD FORMULA FOR SUPPORTING- ELIGIBILITY WORKERS AND BEING ABLE TO MEET COMMUNITY NEEDS- AND THEN ALSO PRIORITIZING THE CBO'S AND A SISTER THAT'S PART OF THE BENEFITS ECOSYSTEM. SO MAKING SURE THAT- AS WE'RE DEVELOPING BENEFITS CAL BUT IT'S REALLY CLEAR ABOUT THEIR ROLE IN THE ECOSYSTEM AND HOW THEY- THEY ACTUALLY MAKE SURE THAT CONSUMERS CAN ACCESS BENEFITS- THERE'S DATA THAT SHOWS THAT. CONSUMERS HAVE A 60% BETTER CHANCE OF GETTING BENEFITS IF THEY WORK WITH SOMEBODY AND A SISTER- AND WE KNOW THAT THE FOLKS WORKING WITH THE SISTERS ARE OFTEN PEOPLE OF THE HARDEST TIME ACCESSING BENEFITS ON THEIR OWN. IF PEOPLE COULD DO IT ON THEIR OWN THEY WOULD THEY GO TO A SISTER BECAUSE THEY NEED HELP- AND THEN DIGITAL EQUITY- YOU KNOW WHAT COURSE YOU WANT THE BENEFITS CAL WEBSITE TO BE IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE LAW THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. BUT WE ALSO WANTED TO BE SET UP IN A WAY WHERE THE INFORMATION FLOW THE QUESTIONS THE WAY THEY'RE WORDED ALLOW CONSUMERS TO. BE IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE LOT AS WELL SO THEY DON'T GET CONFUSED AND ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS OR OR JUST GIVE UP AND THE NOT APPLIED APPLIED ALL- AND SO. HAVING A HUMAN CENTERED DESIGN APPROACHES I THINK IT'S BEEN VENTURED BEFORE AND THAT OFFENSE TAKEN AUTHENTIC ENGAGEMENT AS PART OF THE PROCESS. SO THOSE ARE A FEW OF THE STRATEGIES THAT WE THINK WOULD BE REALLY GREAT FOR THE STATE TO SUPPORT AND TO CONTINUE CHECKING BACK WITH ABOUT HOW IS THAT GOING AND- AND HOW ARE WE ACTUALLY MODELING THAT PRACTICE- AND FOR MY SECOND QUESTION ABOUT THAT HE- FEATURES- FIRST I'D- YOU KNOW. I WANTED. THAT THE COLLABORATION WE'VE BEEN CREATING WITH CAL STARS AS CONTINUING TO EVOLVE. AND WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT A NEW WORK GROUP THAT'S BEING DEVELOPED THAT WILL INCLUDE CONSUMERS. THE COUNTIES S. C. B. O. ADVOCATES- TO ADD TO DECIDE TOGETHER HOW DO WE PRIORITIZE THINGS. AND SO WE'RE EXCITED TO INVEST IN THAT AND LOOKED BACK BEFORE TO COME BACK TO TELL YOU HOW THAT'S GOING- THE OVERALL. I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS WE'D LIKE TO SEE IS A WAYS TO REDUCE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN- SOME OF US KNOW THE TERM BEING TIME POOR. WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO DO EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO DO- FOR SOME OF US THAT MEANS WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO TO THE GYM OR ANSWER ALL OUR EMAILS. BUT WE KNOW FOR FOLKS WHO ARE STRUGGLING IT MEANS. DO I CHOOSE BETWEEN TAKING MY KID TO THE DOCTOR. WAITING IN LINE TO GET FOOD OR FILLING OUT PAPERWORK. TO TRY TO GET BENEFITS A FEW WEEKS FROM NOW. AND SO WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ACCESS POINTS WE HAVE. REDUCE THAT ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN AND THAT WERE FUNDING COUNTY SO THAT THEY CAN PICK UP THE SLACK ON THAT FOR THE THINGS WE KNOW THEY'RE OBLIGATED TO MAKE SURE HAPPEN AS PART OF THAT PROCESS. THE LAST JUST COUPLE THINGS I'LL MENTION- ONE OF THE BARRIERS THAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW WITH BENEFITS CALLOUS PEOPLE CAN'T GET AN ACCOUNT. TO USE ALL OF THE REALLY COOL FUNCTIONALITY WITHOUT AN EMAIL ADDRESS. AND FOR FOLKS WHO HAVE LOW. TECH THE ABILITY THEY CAN USE THE WEBSITE BUT THEY JUST MIGHT NOT HAVE THAT EMAIL ADDRESS TO DO IT SO. WANTING TO SHIFT THAT PART OF THE PROCESS- WE WANT TO STICK. BETWEEN THE COUNTIES IN TERMS OF. ARE THEY- THEY IMPLEMENTING ALL OF THE OPTIONS THAT THEY HAVE DIPS A PROFIT PROVIDE ACCESS FOR CONSUMERS SO THAT. THERE IS CONSISTENCY IN PEOPLE'S EXPERIENCES ACROSS THE COUNTIES. AND THEN LASTLY- WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE SYSTEMS ARE WORKING SO HAVING A ROBUST PUBLIC DASHBOARD THAT WE CAN SHOW. THOSE METRICS OF POWER PEOPLE NOT ONLY USING THE SYSTEM SO WE CAN SEE WHERE WE NEED TO TWEAK THE SYSTEM. BUT ALSO ARE WE GETTING THE RESULTS THAT WE WANT TO HAVE SAID THAT THERE IS BOTH. THE SYSTEM FUNCTION AND THE OUTCOMES PIECE AS PART OF THAT DASHBOARD. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TODAY THANK YOU NEXT WILL HAVE RUBEN CANNELLA WHO'S THE DIRECTOR OF STRATEGIC EQUITY INITIATIVES. AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY BASIC NEEDS COMMITTEE. YEAH THANK YOU SO MUCH I JUST BEFORE I GET STARTED I DO WANT TO SHARE SOMETHING SO I GREW UP IN A IN A WOMAN MAJORITY FAMILY AND THE FAMILIES FEMINISTS HOUSEHOLD. AND I MOVED BACK HOME TO TAKE CARE OF FAMILY DURING THE PANDEMIC BECAUSE IT GOT ROUGH. AND MY MOM WOULD ALWAYS COME IN THAT IT WAS ALWAYS A BUNCH OF CREDITS AND WOMEN AND ALL OF MY ZOOM SPACES AND IT WAS A FEMALE MAJORITY SHE WAS ALWAYS SUPER EXCITED AND THEN SHE OULD ALSO SPEND TO ME AND SAY. HOW COME MEN ARE NOT DOING ENOUGH. SO I'LL MAKE SURE TO LET HER KNOW TODAY THAT THE SPACE WERE HELD BY MAIL. WHO SAYS MINE LAST NAME CORRECTLY AND BUY A WHOLE BUNCH OF MEN. THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE CONVERSATION BECAUSE I THINK SHE'S GOING TO BE VERY HAPPY TO HEAR THAT SO JUST WANT TO START WITH THAT- I THINK AFTER ME IN THE TIME THAT I HAVE. WE WANTED TO WE WANTED TO REALLY LIFT AND CELEBRATE THE FACT THAT THERE'S BEEN SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS IN THIS AREA OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS I THINK OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS. MAGIC HAPPEN AND WE STARTED ORGANIZING ACROSS THE DIFFERENT SECTORS ACROSS A DIFFERENT COMMUTE TO SAY IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR US TO BE COMPETING WITH EACH OTHER. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR US TO NOT BE CONNECTED TO EACH OTHER AND IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR US TO. CONTINUE COORDINATING EFFORTS AND THE SEPARATE ISOLATED AREAS OF THIS WORK WHEN OUR COMMUNITIES ARE EXPERIENCING ALL OF US AT ONCE FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE. SOMETHING THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF PROGRESS THAT NOW I FEEL VERY CONFIDENT WE WERE JUST TALKING JOHN. AND US THROUGHOUT THE DAY. THAT CALIFORNIA IS NOW A NATIONAL MODEL FOR A LOT OF THIS WORK FROM THE TECHNOLOGY TO THE ORGANIZING TO THE STRUCTURES TO THE DECISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE WAY THAT WE HAVE PRIORITIZE IN THE IMPACT THAT WE'RE HAVING AND YOU CAN SEE. IT SEE IT AND THE DRASTIC INCREASE IN APPLICATIONS IF YOU JUST LOOK AT COLLEGE STUDENTS AS A CASE STUDY. IT'S A MASSIVE INCREASE WHERE WE WEREN'T EVEN AT 1% OF COLLEGE STUDENTS THAT WERE APPLYING. AND NOW WE'RE ABOUT STUDENTS APPLYING FOR CALFRESH ALONE RIGHT SO THERE'S A LOT TO CELEBRATE THEIR- AND AS WE HAVE MADE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS WE'VE ALSO BEEN LEARNING ABOUT. WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE MISSING THAT CAN HELP US SCALE BECAUSE BY THE END OF THE DAY WE'RE LEAVING A LOT OF FEDERAL RESOURCES. THAT SHOULD BE COMING TO CALIFORNIA. IMPROVING THE LOCAL ECONOMIES IMPROVING THE STATE ECONOMY. CARING FOR OUR COMMUNITIES AND MEETING THE METRICS OF SUCCESS THAT WE EXPECT OUT OF THESE KINDS OF INVESTMENTS. TOPPING WHAT WE WANTED TO LIVE WAS. HOW DO WE MOVE IN THE DIRECTION OF. AS WE CONTINUE TO. CELEBRATE OUR CDSS C. W. D. A. CAL SAUCE THE CBO'S. HIGHER EDUCATION THAT WILL ALSO BEING INTENTIONAL ABOUT INVESTING AND THE FOLLOW THROUGH OF A LOT OF THIS WORK. OUT REACH. AS ADULT AT A POINT THAT WE HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE RIGHT LIKE THERE'S MANDATED. VERIFICATIONS COMMUNICATIONS PROACTIVE ENGAGING WITH THE COMMUNITY. THAT NOW- AGAIN COLLEGE STUDENTS AS A CASE STUDY. RECEIVE MULTIPLE COMMUNICATIONS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR ABOUT THE POTENTIAL LEGIBILITY. AND ENCOURAGING THEM TO APPLY. WHAT WE DON'T SEE IS WE DON'T SEE. WHAT ARE THE OUTCOMES OF THOSE APPLICATIONS. WHAT WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO IS THE NEW ONES LEVEL OF. LET'S SAY AT A COUNTY A COUNTY LIKE ALAMEDA COUNTY. HAS MULTIPLE COLLEGES COMMUNITY COLLEGES STATE UNIVERSITY ANNA YOU SEE WITHIN THE SAME COUNTY. WE HAVE NO IDEA IF ELIGIBILITY WORKERS ARE HAVING. EASIER BETTER MORE SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME OF THE UC BERKELEY APPLICATIONS COMPARED TO THE CAL STATE EAST BAY APPLICANTS COMPARED TO LANIER LOANEES ON AND SO FORTH DOES NOT MAKE SENSE YUP. BECAUSE THE APPLICATIONS ARE SO NUANCED. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO WHAT ARE THE OUTCOMES WHAT THE- OUTCOMES DATA OF THIS WORK. AND HOW DO WE CONTROL FOR SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT ARE NO PREVIOUS PANELISTS HAVE TALKED ABOUT ABOUT. IT I CAUGHT I'M AN ETHNIC STUDIES MAJOR SO IUSE INTERSECTION ALLEY. BUT ON THE DATA SIDE WE USE MULTI FACTOR ANALYSES. WE NEED THAT MULTI FACTOR ANALYSIS TO SEE. FOR THE APPLICANTS THAT ARE GETTING BETTER OUTCOMES FOR THE OUT APPLICANTS ARE NOT GETTING THE BETTER OUTCOMES. SO THAT WE CAN USE THAT TO EDUCATE TO TRYING TO COACH EACH OTHER. I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF FEAR THAT PEOPLE THINK THAT WE WANT TO USE THAT THE THAT. THAT DATA TO SHAME OR TO. I DON'T KNOW THOUGH KINDS OF. IMPLICATIONS TO THE COMPETITION THAT IS NOT THE CULTURE AND THE VALUES THAT WE BRING INTO THIS WORK. NO ONE WINS FROM SHAMING AND BLAMING EACH OTHER THERE'S PLENTY OF THAT GOING ON WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS LEARN FROM ONE ANOTHER SO THAT WE CAN AMPLIFY AND BUILD ON THE ASSETS. TO THE WORK AND THE CAPACITY THAT WE HAVE. AND THE LAST THING TO SHARE WITH YOU GUYS I THINK OFTENTIMES WE FORGET THREE KEY THINGS WHEN IT COMES TO THE COLLEGE DURING OUR CONVERSATION SPECIFICALLY. WE THINK THAT THE COLLEGE WORK IS JUST ABOUT COLLEGE STUDENTS. I'M A FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENT I NEED FINANCIAL AID TO GO TO COLLEGE I KNOW THAT THROUGH MY YEARS IN COLLEGE. I WAS STILL TRANSLATING A LOT OF WORK FOR FAMILIES BACK HOME FROM MY OWN FAMILY FOR OUR COMMUNITY. WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS IS BECAUSE THEY CONTINUE TO BE THE PRIMARY SUPPORT SYSTEMS FOR THEIR FAMILIES. WE'RE NOT JUST THINKING ABOUT IMPROVING THE TOOL FOR THE COLLEGE STUDENT THE COALITION IS PROBABLY SUPPORTING THE PARENTS THE SIBLINGS THE WHOEVER IS POTENTIALLY ELIGIBLE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES. THROUGH THEIR TIMING COLLEGE RATHER THAN JUST FOR THEIR OWN BENEFIT. SO THINKING ABOUT COLLEGE STUDENTS AS CROSS POLLINATORS AND AS THE MULTIPLYING EFFECT IS ESSENTIAL FOR US TO LIFT IN THE CONVERSATION. BECAUSE OFTENTIMES WE USE THIS HIERARCHY OF HUMAN VALUE AND PEOPLE THINK THAT WE'RE TRYING TO PUT COLLEGE STUDENTS OVER EVERYONE ELSE. AND THAT'S SIMPLY NOT TRUE WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF EVERYBODY ESPECIALLY FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS I KNOW THAT I COME FROM THE IMPERIAL VALLEY. FOLKS FROM THE IMPERIAL VALLEY DON'T GO TO THE UC AND VOLUMES WE DON'T GO TO THE CSU AND VOLUMES WE MAKE IT INTO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND FROM THERE HOPEFULLY WE MAKE IT INTO A FOUR YEAR. SO THAT KIND OF LIKE HIERARCHY OF HUMAN VALUE MAKES NO SENSE CULTURALLY ORRIN REACT AND THE REAL IMPLICATIONS. SECOND TO LAST THING IS. EVERY SINGLE STUDY THAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST TEN YEARS HAS CONFIRMED. THAT THE METRICS OF SUCCESS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION THE CALIFORNIA CARES ABOUT. ACCESS AFFORDABILITY RETENTION PERSISTENCE PERFORMANCE AND COMPLETION ARE ALL AND RIGHT RELATIONSHIP WITH BASIC NEEDS. IF WE'RE NOT MEETING THE BASIC NEEDS OF STUDENTS NONE OF THOSE METRICS SAYS OF HIGHER EDUCATION ALEJO AND THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY OF ACCOUNTABILITY. HOLD US ACCOUNTABLE TO CAN BE MET. WE KNOW THAT STUDENTS THAT HAVE THEIR BASIC NEEDS MET PERFORMED AT MUCH BETTER AND HIGHER RATES AND OUTCOMES IN ALL OF THOSE METRICS AS A SUCCESS. AND THE LAST THING AND I THINK WHAT WOULD BE MOST HELPFUL. IS TO UNDERSTAND THAT OFTENTIMES WHEN WE HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS WE IMMEDIATELY THINK ABOUT COST. AND THE RETURN OF INVESTMENT AND WE THINK ABOUT THE COST IN REAL TIME BUT WE DON'T THINK ABOUT HOW. WHAT'S THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT AND THINKING ABOUT. THE CAPACITY OF STUDENTS BEING ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE AND GENERATIVE WAYS THIS IS DATA THAT WE GOT FROM CDSS AND FROM C. SACK. FOR THE AMOUNT OF ZERO. EFC STUDENTS THE LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT STUDENTS IN THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY ONE. WE HAD JUST AND ROLLED 50% OF THEM. NOT EVEN AT THE MAXIMUM OF CALIPHATE'S LET'S SAY AROUND TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN FEDERAL DOLLAR VALUE OF FOURTEEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS A MONTH. EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN SIX MONTHS AND A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN TWELVE MONTHS. JUST DOING IT FOR THAT SMALL PORTION OF THE COLLEGE STUDENT POPULATION. AND YOU AMPLIFY THAT TO LOW FC TO WORKING CLASS STUDENTS. THE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE NEEDED FOR US TO BUILD OUT THIS DATA INFRASTRUCTURE FOR PUBLIC DASHBOARDS TO INFORM THE WORK. ESSENTIALLY PAYS ITSELF AND WAY MORE. SO JUST WANTED TO LIFT THOSE CONVERSATIONS SO THAT WE CAN SAY AS WE CELEBRATE AND WE'RE CONSIDERING WHAT ARE THE INVESTMENTS TO MAKE. THAT WE'RE THINKING ABOUT WHERE WE'RE GOING AND NOT JUST WHERE WE HAVE BEEN AND WHERE WE ARE TODAY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE INVITATION. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM KATHY SANDERLING MCDONALD WITH CWDM. THANK YOU MR CAL NUMBERS CATHOLIC DONALD C. W. DA- PERFORMING UP TO THE TWO QUESTIONS ON THE AGENDA I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THE PANEL IS SO- DIVERSE WHEN I FIRST BACK TO- THAT. THE TOPIC THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND I'M FINDING IT TO BE EXTREMELY ENJOYABLE AND REALLY INFORMATIVE AND SO I JUST WANT TO COMMEND. YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR PUTTING TOGETHER- JUST A GREAT DISCUSSION ON WHAT CAN OFTEN BE A VERY PRICE SUBJECT. THE ISSUE OF HOW THE I. T. AN AUTOMATION CAN SUPPORT. MY MEMBERS AND THEIR STAFF AS WELL AS THE CUSTOMERS THAT WE ALSO SUPPORT- THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO MAKE THAT POINT. I WOULD TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE WS CARE AND FEW TO BE DA AND THE COUNTIES ROLL WITH THAT PROJECT. AND HOW WE SEE IT GOING SO FAR. AS WELL AS MY STAFF. AND WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH CDS ASSET- I FINAL QUESTION HER FROM TODAY- AND HAVE A NUMBER OF COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES AS WELL INTEGRATED INTO THE PROJECT TEAM. THESE ARE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS AND THAT RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE END USERS ARE CHILD WELFARE WORKERS. REPRESENTED AT THE SYSTEM IS BEING DESIGNED AND BUILT TO ENSURE THAT IT WILL WORK. COUNTY WAITING A LONG TIME FOR A NEW TRIAL SYSTEM AND WE'RE REALLY EXCITED TO SEE THE PROJECT GETTING STARTED TO BUILD THE FUNCTIONALITY TO REPLACE. CWS AT. THE EXISTING SYSTEM IS NOT ROBUST ENOUGH TO CAPTURE ALL OF THE INFORMATION AND DATA WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE. BOTH FOR THE ACCOUNTABILITY AS WE DISCUSSED ON THE PRIOR PANEL AS WELL AS FOR SERVICE DELIVERY AND PLANNING COURT ENGAGEMENT AND THE OTHER VITAL WORK THAT COUNTY CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES JAIL. AS THE VENDORS WORK WITH THE PROJECT TO ADJUST PROJECT PLANS BASED ON LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE DEMONSTRATION MODEL THAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY WORKING ON. WE ALSO KNOW THAT WILL NEED TO ADDRESS THE PLANS AND FUNDING FOR COUNTY PARTICIPATION TO ALIGN WITH ANY SCHEDULE CHANGES THAT HAPPEN. JUST WANT TO MAKE THE POINT THOUGH THAT MAINTAINING COUNTY PARTICIPATION FUNDING AS WELL AS THE OVERARCHING EXTRICATION OF COUNTY ENGAGEMENT AND REPRESENTATION IS ESSENTIAL. TO ENSURING THAT ROBUST COUNTY PARTICIPATION AND THAT PERSPECTIVE AT THE END USER IS SUPPORT IT. IF NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT THE SYSTEM MORE BUILDING WILL MEET COUNTY STAFF NEEDS AS THEY WORK TO SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE CHILDREN. WELL OUR STAFF ARE THE END USERS OF THE SYSTEM AS WE TALK ABOUT WE ALWAYS LET'S KEEP IN MIND THE NEEDS OF THAT ALTERNATE CUSTOMER PARTICULARLY THE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES THAT WE SERVE IT MIGHT. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE ENCOUNTERED BOTH AT THAT C. W. D. A. LEVEL AS WELL AS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. IT IS WITH THE STATE CONTRACTING PROCESS. AS WE ENTER INTO WITH THE STATE BOTH C. W. D. A. CORRECTLY AS WELL AS COUNTY'S INDIVIDUALLY MUST GO THROUGH A FULL CONTRACTING PROCESS AND BE APPROVED. THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES WHICH HAVE BEEN INCREASINGLY RESULTING IN DELAYS THE PRETTIEST GAPS IN OUR ABILITY TO HAVE COUNTY AND TO THE MEDIA REPRESENTATIVE. JOIN THE PROJECT NAMELY AND CAN WE CAN EXTENDED THE LAYS THE BILLING VACANCIES THAT OCCUR. THE WORK AT THE WTA COUNTIES ARE DOING ON TEARS AND OTHER IT PROJECTS AS WELL REALLY DOESN'T FIT NEATLY WITHIN THE NORMAL STATE CONTACTING PROTOCOLS- THIS IS NOT A WIDGET THAT WERE PRODUCING THESE ARE- TECHNICAL REPRESENTATIVES TO IMPORTANT INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROJECTS. AND THERE ARE VARIOUS EGS PROVISIONS VENDOR MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS THAT REALLY JUST DON'T APPLY IN THIS TYPE OF ENVIRONMENT. WE DO BELIEVE THAT SOME DEREK TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD EXEMPT OUR CONTRACTS FROM THE RULES THAT CREATE DELAYS WHAT IMPROVE CONTINUITY ON THIS AND OTHER PROJECTS WITH COUNTY KNOWLEDGEABLE CONSULTANTS. THAT EVERYONE BENEFITS FROM HAVING ON THE PROJECT WE DON'T THINK THERE'S DISAGREEMENT ON THAT POINT. OF AND WOULD BE GLAD TO WORK WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF AS WELL AS OF COURSE THE ADMINISTRATION. TO HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE. UNNECESSARY GAPS. IN ADDITION I WAS AT THE TOP A LITTLE BIT OF- SOGHAN- THAT. OF THE COW AND COUNTIES INTERVIEW CAL THOUGHT A BENEFITS CAL WHICH OF YOU KNOW- DOUBLE THEY OF COURSE SINCE RELATED ADDRESS. BUT I WANTED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT FURTHER ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE THOUGHT ABOUT WHEN WE FIRST STARTED PLANNING FOR CALIFORNIA ASIAN- IT'S A PLANNING EFFORT THAT'S FIVE YEARS IN THE MAKING WITH FIRST STARTED PLANNING AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN. AND ACCOUNTED TOP PRIORITY AT THAT TIME WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TRANSITION WILL BE A SMOOTH. AND SEAMLESS AS POSSIBLE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AS WELL AS FOR OUR WORKERS IT REALLY NEEDS TO BE AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE ON BOTH ENDS. TO MAKE SOMETHING SIMPLER FOR- OF FRONT END USER CUSTOMER WHOSE SELF SERVING BUT THAT IT IS EXTREMELY COMPLICATED OF THE BACK AND FOR HER ELIGIBILITY STAFF. IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY HELP ANYBODY AND IT STILL CONTINUES THE POTENTIAL FOR DELAYS OR ERRORS. ONE MORE SERVING CUSTOMERS. SO WE WORK WITH THE COW IS A THE PRICE TO BUILD AND IF THE- BUT THE TRANSITION PARTICULARLY FOR THE CALVIN COUNTIES. KNOWING THAT THEY FACE A BIGGER CHALLENGE MOVING FROM THEIR CURRENT SYSTEM TO CALIFON. THAN THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN THE T. FOR COUNTIES AS MR BLANKENSHIP. SO THAT'S FOR A INFORMED- AT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FACED MIGRATION FOR CALVIN. ALLOWING BOTH THE SUBSEQUENT COUNTIES IN THE PROJECT TO BENEFIT FROM LESSONS LEARNED IN THE PRIOR WAIT. WHAT WE DIDN'T AND COULDN'T HAVE PLANNED FOR WHAT OF LOCAL PANDEMIC THAT LASTED FOR TWO YEARS AND TECHNICALLY IS STILL ONGOING THOUGH OF COURSE IN A MUCH BETTER SITUATION THAN WE HAPPEN. LOCALLY AND BECAUSE WORK THE PROJECT DOES YOUR MAY NOT SCHEDULE AND BOTH THE COUNTY AND THE FONTS HAVE MANAGED TO IMPLEMENT NUMEROUS POLICY CHANGES AT THE SAME TIME. BOTH TEMPORARY CHANGES THAT WERE RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC AND PERMANENT DUE TO CHANGING STATE AND FEDERAL POLICIES. THERE ARE MANY MORE POLICY CHANGES EVERY YEAR BEING DISCUSSED UP AS WELL AS THIS YEAR BOTH IN THE BUDGET AND LEGISLATIVE SESSION. AND WE REALLY ENTHUSIASTICALLY SUPPORT MANY OF THESE WE PUT A FEW FOR HERSELF. BUT WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T LOSE THE ORIGINAL FOCUS OF TRYING TO MAKE THIS. VERY BIG TRANSITION FROM CAL WENT TO CAL FIVE AS SMOOTH AS POSSIBLE FOR THE 40% OF OUR STATE. IT'S GOING TO BE MAKING THE SWITCH BETWEEN OCTOBER OF. TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND OCTOBER OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. MY STAFF AND I ARE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION THE SUBCOMMITTEE AND YOUR STAFF AND CAL SIZE. TO IDENTIFY IMPLEMENTATION DATES THAT ARE FEASIBLE FOR ABOUT THE COUNTY SAN CALIFORNIA'S TO MEET. AND ALSO INFLOWS AND ONE ECHO THE COMMENTS BY MR BLAIR REGARDING THE SIGNIFICANT STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND IT HELPS US DEVELOPMENT PROCESS OF ROLLOUT. AT THE LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT I DON'T RECALL SEEING IN MY FEW DECADES THE C. W. D. A. WITH OTHER EFFORTS. NOT THAT THERE WASN'T ENGAGEMENT BUT THAT THIS ENGAGEMENT IS SO MUCH MORE ROBUST AND PUBLIC BASED THING THAT HAPPENS IN RIOR PROJECTS THAT I AM PARTICIPATED IN OR OBSERVED. OF IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT PROCESS REALLY SPEAKS TO STRIKE THAT APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN THE NEED FOR A STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AS WELL AS THE ABILITY TO KEEP OUR DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. RUNNING SMOOTHLY AND WORKING WITH. COUNTY STAFF THAT INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THINGS MOVING AND DEVELOPED- WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AS WE GET TO THAT POINT AND THAT IN THE HEARING THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL. HEAR FROM BRIAN METZGER WITH THE L. L. GOOD AFTERNOON- CARL WAS ASKED TODAY TO SOME HIGH LEVEL ISSUES QUESTIONS OBSERVATIONS- ABOUT ALL THE DIFFERENT TOPICS WE'VE HEARD TODAY SO- I'LL KEEP TO ABOUT FIVE OBSERVATIONS THAT WE HAVE FOR YOU TODAY IT'S A LOT BUT HOPEFULLY WE GET THROUGH THEM QUICKLY- THE FIRST OF WHICH IS- YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT SEVERAL IT PROJECTS TODAY AND WE FIND IT IS CRITICAL TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE BASELINE COST SCHEDULE AND SCOPE OF THESE PROJECTS ARE- BROADLY THE STATUS TRANSITION TO MORE INTERACTIVES INCREMENTAL KIND OF DEVELOPMENT IMPLEMENTATION OF PROJECTS AND THAT'S SLOWLY BEING REFLECTED IN THE WAY THAT THE STATE ADMINISTERS ITS IT PROJECTS. HOWEVER SOME PROJECTS HAVE STRUGGLED TO SET THEIR BASELINE COST AND SCHEDULE AND SCOPE BECAUSE THE APPROACH INTRODUCES ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY AND DOES NOT HAVE COMMENSURATE CHANGES AND OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL. FOR EXAMPLE WITH CWS CARES- WE FIND THAT SOME OF THE FLEXIBILITY THAT WERE AFFORDED TO THIS PROJECT REDUCE THE LEGISLATURE'S OVERSIGHT. ONE PARTICULAR EXAMPLE OF THAT IS THE ALLOWANCE OF ANNUAL SPECIAL PROJECT REPORTS WHICH ALLOW FOR MORE FREQUENT UPDATING OF KIND OF THE BASELINE COST SCHEDULE AND SCOPE FOR THE PROJECT. ALSO THERE WERE ISSUES AROUND THE COST ESTIMATION FOR THIS PROJECT- WHEN S. P. R. FOR WAS APPROVED FOR THIS PROJECT THERE WAS A CONDITION. THAT THE PROJECT A CHOIR OF COST ESTIMATION EXPERT TO MORE PRECISELY ESTIMATE THE COST OF THE PROJECT AND TO OUR KNOWLEDGE THAT WAS NOT COMPLETED EMPHASIZED THE NEED TO. FOCUS ON FIXING THE COST SCHEDULE AND SCOPE OF THE PROJECT SUCH THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN OVERSEE WHETHER THERE HAVE BEEN CHANGES AND WHAT THOSE CHANGES TRULY REPRESENTED. SECONDLY WE WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE ARE SEEING PROJECTS WITH METRICS TO MEASURE COMPLETION AND OUTCOMES DEVELOPMENT- WE DO SEE FOR EXAMPLE WITH CWS CARES THE USE OF MILESTONES AND OTHER MEASURES TO MEASURE COMPLETION. AND THE USE OF KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS TO KIND OF MONITOR THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PROJECT WE FIND THESE ARE HELPFUL BUT THEY HAVE TO BE FAIRLY CONSISTENT IN THEIR APPLICATION ACROSS THE LIFECYCLE OF A PROJECT TO BE USEFUL AND THEY NEED TO BE UNDERSTOOD BY THE LEGISLATURE AND STAKEHOLDERS. TO MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF THE PROJECT AND SO THE LEGISLATURE IF THOSE TWO THINGS ARE MATT CAN USE THEM AS A MECHANISM FOR MAKING SURE THAT THE FUNDING WE APPROVE IS TIED TO THE ACTUAL COMPLETION OF THE PROJECT AND THE OUTCOMES THAT WE GET. OUT OF THEM. AGAIN WITH THE ABSENCE OF A CLEAR BASS LINE FOR CWS CARES THOUGH IT MAKES IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR THAT OVERSIGHT TO HAPPEN. A FEW OTHER OBSERVATIONS AND THESE ARE JUST GENERAL OBSERVATIONS TO KEEP IN MIND YOU AGAIN HEARD A LOT ABOUT DIFFERENT IT PROJECTS AND SYSTEMS. I THINK IT PROJECTS AND SYSTEMS SHOULD BE PLAN DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED AND I THINK THERE'S BROAD AGREEMENT WITH CONSIDERATION OF HOW THE INTERFACE WITH ONE ANOTHER. AND ALSO OPPORTUNITIES FOR INTEGRATION BETWEEN THEM I THINK THERE HAVE BEEN OPPORTUNITIES THAT ABOUT HIGHLIGHTED HERE TODAY BETWEEN. YOU KNOW EXISTING SYSTEMS AND SAY THE STATE VERIFICATION HUB YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THOSE ARE ALL- IN SERVICE OF TRYING TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR BENEFICIARIES TO ACCESS PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. HOWEVER THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO BE MADE AWARE OF HOW ALL OF THESE I. T. PROJECTS SYSTEMS WORK TOGETHER- IN THE ABSENCE OF CLEAR. YOU KNOW- INFORMATION IT'S PRESENTED IN A VERY USER FRIENDLY WAY TO MAKE US UNDERSTAND HOW ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT PROJECTS ARE ALIGNED. AND THE TIMELINE FOR EACH OF THEM I THINK IT MAKES IT HARDER FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE. SITE OUR FOURTH OBSERVATION IS AGAIN NOT EVERY I. T. PROJECT AND SYSTEM IS OF THE SAME AGE AND CRITICALITY. TO THESE PROGRAMS WE HAVE SYSTEMS THAT ARE VERY OLD AND HAVE HAD DISRUPTIONS BECAUSE OF JUST THE AGE OF THE SYSTEM ITSELF. WE KNOW THAT THEIR EFFORTS THAT ARE BEING LED BY DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY TO LOOK AT STATE GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS AS A WHOLE. TO UNDERSTAND WHICH ONES ARE MOST AT RISK OF DISRUPTION AND OR FAILURE. WE THINK UNDERSTANDING THE AGENT CRITICALITY OF THESE PROJECTS AND SYSTEMS WITH INTELLIGENT CHEST. PARTICULAR DEPARTMENTS WITH THE UNDER THAT AGENCY IS CRUCIAL FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT HOW BEST. TO INVEST PROJECT AND SYSTEM RESOURCES. AND FINALLY WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT. OPPORTUNITIES FOR STAKEHOLDERS AND USERS TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE IT PROJECTS AND SYSTEMS. WE THINK THAT MAKES SENSE GIVEN PERSON CENTER PROGRAMS AND USER CENTERED DESIGN BECOMING CRITICAL TO THESE IT PROJECTS. BUT WE THINK THAT THERE COULD BE SOME YOU KNOW. BETTER ORGANIZATION OF THE INPUT FROM STAKEHOLDERS AND USERS TO ACTUALLY INFORM IT PROJECTS AND SYSTEMS WE'VE SEEN THIS MOST RECENTLY WITH THE CAL HERE'S DASHBOARD THAT WAS PUT TOGETHER FOR- FUNCTIONALITIES IN THE KALHOR SYSTEM. THAT COUNTY ELIGIBILITY WORKERS REALLY WANTED TO SEE PUT INTO THAT SYSTEM AND THAT PROCESS OF ESTABLISHING A DASHBOARD AND HAVING ROUTINE MEETINGS WITH. PROJECT STEERING COMMITTEE REALLY ALLOWED FOR PRIORITIZATION AND KIND OF IMPLEMENTATION OF DIFFERENT FUNCTIONALITIES THAT WERE NOT BEING YOU KNOW. PUT INTO PLACE A AND A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME RECOMMENDATIONS REALLY ARE. AROUND ONE WITH CWS CARES THAT'S DOUBLE CHECK THAT BASS LINE MAKING SURE THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE TRUE COST OF THIS PROJECT IS THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN UNDERWAY FOR MANY YEARS AND WE TRULY DO NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT COSTS WHAT THE SCHEDULE IS AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO GET FOR ALL OF THAT MONEY AND TIME. WE ARE STILL WAITING YOU KNOW SPECIAL PRODUCT REPORT FIVE AND WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT THE FUNDING REQUEST FOR THE LEGISLATURE. I'M TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A ADEQUATE OVERSIGHT- AND AGAIN WE THINK THE FIRST KIND OF SET OF METRICS IS A GOOD START. BUT WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THE LEGISLATURE UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES WITH THE METRICS THAT ARE USED. TO MONITOR THESE PROJECTS. SECOND I THINK IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR SOME OTHER PROJECTS TO POTENTIALLY CONSIDER THE USE. OF SOMETHING LIKE A DASHBOARD SOME MECHANISM FOR GATHERING THE INPUT OF STATE COAL THERE'S AND OTHER USERS OF A SYSTEM. SUCH THAT THEY CAN PRIORITIZE FUNCTIONALITY CHANGES ARE THINGS THAT CAN REALLY. KIND OF BE MADE AND THE CHANGES THAT WE MADE IN THE SYSTEM- ONCE FOR EXAMPLE THE MIGRATION HAS ALREADY HAPPENED A CAL SAUCER TO BENEFITS CAL. SOMETHING THAT BETTER ORGANIZES THE INPUT FROM ALL OF THE DIFFERENT GROUPS ARE PARTICIPATING. AND THIRD WE THINK IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR THE SUB COMMITTEE TO HEAR MORE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY. ABOUT HOW IT'S CONDUCTING THIS KIND OF STATE GOVERNMENT LEVEL. ASSESSMENT OF WHICH SYSTEMS TRULY ARE AT RISK. WHICH PROJECTS REALLY NEED TO BE PRIORITIZE. WE CAN AVOID DISRUPTIONS SERVICE. AND WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM TYLER WOULD ROB TROJAN WITH PERMANENT FINANCE. YES TIGER WOODS PERMANENT FINANCE IF IT'S OKAY I MAY PASS THIS ONE OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES TO DSS RENTAL AT. HAPPY TO JUMP IN- SECOND BRANCH BUT- RESEARCH AUTOMATION DATABASE AND I'M GOING TO PROVIDE UPDATES ON A COUPLE OF- PROJECTS SO THE FIRST IS. MIGRATING DATA FROM LEGACY SYSTEMS- THIS IS A PROPOSAL TO REQUEST ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME GENERAL FUND DOLLARS FOR CONTRACT SERVICES TO MIGRATE LEGACY DATA SYSTEMS TO NEW FACILITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND TO EXTEND TO LIMITED TERM POSITIONS WORKING ON IMMIGRATION. JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THE CONTRACT SERVICES VISIONS ARE SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE ON JUNE THIRTIETH OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. SINCE NINETEEN- SINCE FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN AT NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY CSS HAS BEEN MIGRATING DATA FROM AN ANTIQUATED SYSTEM USED BY THE COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING DIVISION YOU TO DATA COMPLEXITY INVOLVED IN EIGHT DIFFERENT LEGACY SYSTEMS OR DATA QUALITY DUE TO EFFORT LEGACY SYSTEMS- I. T. AND BUSINESS RESOURCES REQUIRE MORE PROFOUND UNDERSTANDING THAT INITIALLY ANTICIPATED- AND SO THE DATA FROM CURRENT CCL SYSTEM WITH LOW MARKET. COMPLEX THAN INITIALLY EXPECTED WHEN THE CONTRACTOR CAME ON BOARD THESE RESOURCES WILL HELP MAKE SURE WE ARE ABLE TO COMPLETE THE MIGRATION EFFORT. THE PROJECT- TO BE COUNTY IT'S CLAIM REPORTING INFORMATION SYSTEMS FUNDING AUGMENTATION. THIS PROPOSAL REQUEST TWO MILLION DOLLARS EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND GENERAL FUND TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. AND SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTEEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND SIX THOUSAND WHAT YOUR GENERAL FUND TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. I TO COMPLETE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COUNTY EXPENSE CLAIMS EASY ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONALITY AND FOR MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS OF THE COUNTY EXPENSE CLAIM REPORTING INFORMATION SYSTEM ALSO THAT SEACREST PROJECT. THE FUNDING WILL SUPPORT SOLUTION VENDOR CONTRACT SERVICES FUND OR LIMITED TERM POSITION. THE REQUESTED RESOURCES WILL ALLOW US TO CONTINUE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT- I DO BELIEVE YOU CAN DO BUSINESS NOW ALSO FOR ANYBODY. AND TESTING OF COMPLEX BUSINESS RULES FOR THE REMAINING CLAIM PROCESS SEES INCLUDES PAYMENT CLOSE OUT AND OUT OF SEQUENCE CLICK PROCESS SEES. OF THE SECRET SOLUTION. I UNDERSTAND THAT- RESOURCES WILL SUPPORT A COMPREHENSIVE IMPLEMENTATION ROLLOUT AND KNOWLEDGE CONDITION MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS OF THE SECRET SOLUTION USED BY COUNTIES TO SUBMIT QUARTERLY AND MONTHLY CLAIMS FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. THE FUNDS RESOLUTION BETTER SUPPORT WILL ENSURE DEDICATED EXPERIENCED PROFESSIONAL SERVICES TO CONTINUE WITH THE DEVELOPMENT. OF THE REMAINING ECMASCRIPT FUNCTIONALITY THANK YOU. THANK YOU IS THAT'S THE COMPLETION OF THIS PANEL I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DÍAS TO BEGIN QUESTIONS. I AM FIRST GONNA START BY ECHOING WHAT THE L. A. O. HAD SAD OF THE NEED FOR US TO UNDERSTAND THE BASELINE COST SCHEDULE AND SCOPE. AND I WOULD SPECIFICALLY LIKE TO FOCUS US ON C. W. S. CARES WHICH IS TO REPLACE CWS CMS WE HEARD FROM MISS TUCKER EARLIER THAT THE GOAL OF THIS TRANSITION HAS TO HELP US TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR CALIFORNIA CHILDREN. THAT WE CURRENTLY ARE HAVING A DEMONSTRATION MODEL IN FIVE COUNTIES BUT IT SOUNDED LIKE YOU WERE GOING TO SUGGEST THAT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE A DELAY. AND I WAS THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT BEGAN IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AND HAS COST THE STATE NINE HUNDRED ELEVEN MILLION. DOLLARS THUS FAR I BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND THE FULL COST SCHEDULE AND SCOPE SO I'D LIKE TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING IF I CAN Y. WHEN WE ASKED FOR. THE UC THE ACQUIRING OF A COST ESTIMATE THAT THIS WAS NOT. COMPLETED AS WELL AS IF YOU CAN HELP TO OUTLINED WHEN WE EXPECT. C. WSC AMASSED TO BE REPLACED WITH C. W. S. CARES. HOPING THE DEPARTMENT CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION. AT THE TOP- SO I THINK- FOR CLARITY WE DID A PUBLIC LAST ESTIMATE WITH OUR INDEPENDENT ADVISOR- IN THE YOU KNOW EARLIER ON IN THEIR CONTRACT AND THEY CAME UP WITH SOME RECOMMENDATIONS AND SOME YOU KNOW IN DISCUSSIONS WITH US OF THINGS THAT WE COULD DO SO. WE ARE WE HAVE REALIGNED DURING OUR DEMONSTRATION MODEL THE DEMONSTRATION MODELS FOR A SLICE OF FUNCTIONALITY WILL BE VERY CLEAR VERY CLEAR ON THAT- WITH FIVE COUNTIES. AND SO NOW THE WITH SOME OF THAT CHANGES WHAT WE'VE LESSONS LEARNED AT. RIGHT TO SEPARATING SOME MODIFICATIONS TO YOU KNOW. RESOURCES ARE PROCESSES THAT THE INDEPENDENT ARCHERS ASSISTING US WITH AND THEN THAT ULTIMATE COST ESTIMATE THE COMPLETION OF THAT COST ESTIMATE WILL BE A S. B. R. SIX WHICH WOULD BE IT- LATER THIS YEAR. WITH REGARD TO THE STATEMENT WITH HAT WE'VE SPENT NINE HUNDRED ELEVEN MILLION SO FAR THAT I I'D LIKE TO CLARIFY THE NINE ELEVEN. IS ACTUALLY THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT FOR THE ENTIRE PROJECT THROUGH- APRIL. ROUGHLY TWENTY TWENTY SIX IT'S NOT THAT THAT'S BEEN SPENT THUS FAR. WE WILL AGAIN THE POINT NOW WE'VE GOTTEN RFA FOR FIVE COUNTIES OUT OF THE FUNDS WE'VE SPENT THUS FAR AND WITHOUT A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE SCHEDULED COST AND SCOPE WE'RE STRUGGLING AS THE LEGISLATURE TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO MAKE SURE WE'RE HOLDING. THE ADMINISTRATION ACCOUNTABLE FOR DELIVERING ON THIS NECESSARY PROGRAM SO I'D LIKE TO ASK SIMILARLY THE L. A. MENTIONED THE METRICS THAT WERE- BEING. MONITORED FOR COMPLETION. AND I'M HOPING THAT WITHIN YOUR NEXT SPECIAL- REPORTS THAT YOU CAN ALSO REPORT TO US AND INCLUDE THE METRICS TO COMPLETION IN YOUR NEXT PROJECT REPORT AND ANNUALLY THERE AFTER SO WE CAN ENSURE WERE TRACKING AND TRENDING. THOSE METRICS AND INVOLVED IN THOSE DECISIONS BUT IT WAS A LITTLE TROUBLING IF I'M PROJECT THAT HAS HAD MULTIPLE DELAYS AND ISSUES IS APPARENTLY HAVING THAT AGAIN AND SO WOULD LIKE TO REALLY GET. CLARIFICATION FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ON. SPECIFIC DATES THAT WE CAN HOLD YOU ACCOUNTABLE TO DELIVER ON THIS PROJECT FOR THE DOLLARS THAT WE'RE GIVING AND SO- LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON HOW WE GET THERE BUT WHEN YOU'RE DOING THAT I HOPE YOU CAN EVALUATE WHAT MANY OF THE PRIMARY COST DRIVERS ARE. AND WHY WE ARE SO HIGH IN TOTAL FOR DOLLARS AND C. W. S. CARES THUS FAR I BELIEVE IT'S AN IMPORTANT QUESTION AND PROCESS FOR US TO UNDERSTAND AS WERE LOOKING AT OTHER- CHANGES WITHIN I. T. SYSTEMS. BUT ULTIMATELY I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IF I CAN FROM THE DEPARTMENT HO THIS WILL ACHIEVE BETTER CASE MANAGEMENT THROUGH C. W. S. CARES. AS WE CURRENTLY ONLY HAVE RFA IN THAT. MODULE HOW WILL THIS ULTIMATELY LEAD TOWARDS BETTER CASE MANAGEMENT WHICH IS THE ULTIMATE GOAL. I WILL STARTED OF JESSICA WANTS TO ADD I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE- BUSINESS ARKAY IS PART OF OUR DEMONSTRATION MARSHALL- ONE OF THE SEGMENTS AS- WHILE WE'RE DEVELOPING THIS FUNCTIONALITY BY FUNCTIONALITY IT'S A SINGLE IMPLEMENTATION. THAT IS PLANNED TO BE COMPLETED IN MAY OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. CURRENTLY- SO. IT'S BUILDING THE ENTIRE SYSTEM TO REPLACE THE WCM **** DOES THAT ASSESSED IN THE TIMING OF WHEN THE CASE MANAGEMENT. WOULD BE PROCESSED SYSTEM WIDE I HEAR IT BUT THE CONFIDENCE WE HAVE TO DELIVER ON THAT IS- PREDICATED ON FOLLOWING MANY OF THE METRICS THAT WE CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE THAT ARE BEFORE US AND US. WITH THE HISTORY WE HAVE WITH THE PROGRAM WE REALLY ARE LOOKING FOR ANOTHER LEVEL OF DETAIL WHICH IS WHY I BELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE INSISTED ON THE ACQUIRING OF A COST ESTIMATE AS WE WERE NOT HAVING A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF THE SCOPE COST AND SCHEDULE OF THIS TRANSITION AND- REALLY WOULD APPRECIATE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION THE ABILITY TO HAVE THAT CLARITY ON THE SPECIFIC PROGRAM- I. WOULD LIKE TO BRING IN THE L. L. IF I CAN FOR SURE. RYAN METZGER LA- JUST TO CLARIFY I BELIEVE THE EXPENDITURES ON THE PROJECT THUS FAR HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT IN EXCESS OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS- AND THE- SET OF FUNCTIONALITIES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE AVAILABLE FOR THIS PROJECT- ARE NOT JUST RFA APPLICATION AND THERE ARE SOME FUNCTIONALITIES- RELATED TO KANSAS- THAT'S CALLED KERR SLIDE BUT STILL BEING SUPPORTED FOR SOME COUNTY SO THERE IS. MORE THAT IS- AVAILABLE- HOWEVER YOU ARE CORRECT THAT- THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN CONCERNED OVER TIME ABOUT KIND OF THE- THE COST CONTROLS GO FOR THIS PROJECT- AND IT IS CLEAR TO FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGIES APPROVAL OF THIS PROJECT. THAT THEY WERE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE COST ESTIMATION THAT WAS DONE AND REQUIRED IT IS PART OF THE LAST PROJECT APPROVAL DOCUMENTATION APPROVAL. LETTER AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT HAS NOT BEEN DONE WE WOULD JUST. REALLY EMPHASIZE THE NEED FOR THAT- AND THE NEED FOR CLEAR METRICS AGAIN WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE METRICS FOR COMPLETION LIKE MILESTONES THAT WILL GIVE US A SENSE OF WHAT IS ACTUALLY BEEN DEVELOPED. FROM THERE ARE METRICS FOR OUTCOMES AND FOR PERFORMANCE LIKE KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS IT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL FOR THE LEGISLATURE I BELIEVE AND- OUR OFFICE WOULD WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THESE METRICS BE MADE VERY CLEAR TO THE LEGISLATURE AND POWER MONITORING THEM OVER TIME. AND IN THE ABSENCE OF THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT. WITHOUT A LOOK FORWARD THE FOLLOW UP ON THIS TRANSITION AYE I WILL MOVE TO MR CONNEL THIS COMMENT ON. CALFRESH WITHIN OUR HIGHER EDUCATION POPULATION I WILL JUST POINT OUT MY OFFICES IN BALLSTON WORKING TO MAKE EXPANSIONS. WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK AT AB TWENTY EIGHT TEN AND THIRTEEN TWENTY SIX THAT WE DID LAST YEAR. THAT ARE LOOKING TO ACTUALLY TAKE THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION THAT WE KNOW. ABOUT HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENTS AND THEN FIGURING OUT IF THEY- QUALIFY FOR MANY OF THE PROGRAMS. I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THAT SAME LOGIC IF I CAN TO RYAN GILLETTE. AS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE STATE VERIFICATION HUB. AND CALFRESH CAL WORKS IN MEDICAL AND CHILD CARE PROGRAMS. YOU SAID IT WAS TO HELP TO STREAMLINE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS. BUT DO WE CHECK WHILE WE ARE VERIFYING THEIR- INCOME IF THEY QUALIFY FOR OTHER PROGRAMS DO WE FOLLOW IT UP WITH. SENDING DOCUMENTS TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO WE ARE BASED IN THESE PROGRAMS ON- ARE WE SIMILARLY FOCUSED ON ENSURING WE ARE PROVIDING AS MUCH ENGAGEMENT AND OUTREACH AS WE CAN. SO IT'S A GREAT QUESTION- THE INITIAL FUNCTIONALITY OF THAT SPEECH AS I MENTIONED IT'S PRIMARILY PRIMARILY JUST TO STREAMLINE THE VERIFICATION PROCESS WHEN A PERSON APPLIES FOR AN INDIVIDUAL SPECIFIC PROGRAM. THAT- WE DON'T WE GET INITIAL ROLLOUT OF IT WILL NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO BASED ON WHAT SOMEONE HAD SUBMITTED SAY WHAT OTHER PROGRAMS SOMEONE MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE FOR- BUT THAT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW WE WOULD BE INTERESTED IN EXPLORING WILL PROBABLY REQUIRES INFORMATION WITH THAT OF PALESTINE'S. TEENS WELL. I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT TOO IF WE CAN USE THE INFORMATION TO KEEP PEOPLE OFF THE PROGRAMS WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE THE INFORMATION TO. FIGURE OUT WHO QUALIFIES SO WE CAN MAKE OUT REACH AND ENGAGEMENT AND- AGAIN PULL DOWN AS MANY FEDERAL RESOURCES AS POSSIBLE TO BENEFIT THOSE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND- WILL JUST ELEVATE AGAIN THE COMMENTS OF- PROFESSOR CANAL. IF I CAN- THAT THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF EDUCATION IT'S AWFULLY HARD TO STUDY AND DO YOUR JOB AS A STUDENT IF YOU'RE HUNGRY OR HAVE BASIC NEEDS AND PLUS I REALLY LOOK TOWARDS THESE VERIFICATION HUBS AS AN OPPORTUNITY. FOR US TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS AS WE'RE GOING FORWARD AS A STATE. WITH THAT I WILL THINK IT'S ENTIRE PANEL FOR THE DISCUSSION AND WE'LL MOVE ON. TO OUR FINAL PANEL BUT BEFORE I DO THAT I'D LIKE TO KINDLY ASK FOR THE FOLLOWING REGARDING C. W. S. CARES. I THINK WE NEED MUCH GREATER TRANSPARENCY IN THIS PROJECT I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AS WELL AS- S. I TO WORK TOGETHER TO HELP TO PROVIDE A HIGH LEVEL EXPLANATION. FOR THE COSTS AND TIMELINES FOR THIS PROJECT. FOR EXAMPLE WHY HAS THE COST BEEN SO HIGH. WHY IS IT TAKING LONGER THAN A DECADE AND WHAT ARE THE GOALS OF COMPLETION FOR THIS PROJECT. I ASK FOR THIS BACK BEFORE THE MAY REVISION RELEASE PLEASE. BECAUSE WE WILL USE IT TO REVIEW SPRING FINANCE LETTERS AS WELL AS THE MAY REVISION PROPOSALS IN THIS AREA I'D LIKE TO ASK FOR THE HELP FROM THE L. A. O. WITH THIS AS WELL TO SUPPORT THE SUB COMMITTEE STAFF PLEASE. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD OPEN ALL OTHER BUDGET ISSUES PENDING ACTION FOR THE MAY REVISION HEARINGS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE PANELISTS HERE WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ISSUE THREE. IS ON THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENT. WE WILL HAVE FOUR PRESENTERS IN THIS PANEL. IT WILL BEGIN WITH DAVID SCRIBNER WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENT WILL JOIN US ON THE WEB AT. FOLLOWED BY ANGELES SHORT WITH THE L. A. L. JALIL BAKER AND KIA CHAU WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. CAN WE PLEASE BEGIN WITH DEPUTY. DIRECTOR SCRIPT. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARAMBULA AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE I'M DAVID SCRIBNER DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENT OR CST. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AN OVERVIEW OF CSP'S BUDGET FOR THE COMING YEAR AND TO PROVIDE UPDATES ON THE STATUS OF THOSE NEW PROGRAMS THE DEPARTMENTS CHARGED WITH IMPLEMENTING IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. CSP FOCUSES ON THE ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF PROGRAMS THAT SERVE AND LIFT UP LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. THE DEPARTMENT OF ALMOST 1100% FEDERALLY FUNDED. WITH FUNDING COMING PRIMARILY FROM THREE FEDERAL GRANTS. THE COMMUNITY SERVICES BLOCK GRANT OR C. S. B. G. THE LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR LIKE EIGHT. IN THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY'S WEATHERIZATION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. SHE'S SHE'S FEDERAL GRANTS HAVE BEEN FUNDED UNDER A CONTINUING RESOLUTION UP TO THE RECENT PASSAGE OF THE TWENTY TWENTY TO FEDERAL BUDGET. WHAT WE DO NOT KNOW FINAL WORDS AS OF YET. BASED ON THE TOTAL APPROPRIATIONS C-SPAN DISSIPATES FUNNY WILL BE RELATIVELY FLAT YEAR OVER YEAR FOR THESE PROGRAMS. WITH POTENTIAL MINOR INCREASES. THE STATE FUNDED LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM OR LIVE WITH. TWO COMPONENTS OF THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND SOLAR PEAVEY PROGRAM ARE CURRENTLY IN OPERATION. THE FARMWORKER HOUSING COMPONENT WHICH SERVES LOW INCOME FARMWORKER HOUSING. AND THE MULTI FAMILY COMPONENT WHICH SERVES MULTI FAMILY AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE GOVERNOR'S CLIMATE RESILIENCE PACKAGE INCLUDES AND DEMAND INVESTMENT OF TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR ALL I WANT MULTI FAMILY TO HELP ADDRESS THE IMPACTS OF EXTREME HEAT. SHE IS THE OTHER ONE BCP THIS YEAR THE REQUESTED SHIFT OF SEVEN FULL TIME POSITIONS FROM THE DEPARTMENT'S TEMPORARY HELP LINK IT. TO ITS PERMANENT POSITION OF AUTHORITY. THE REQUEST PROVIDES A TRUE UP A POSITION AUTHORITY TO REFLECT POSITION YOU SHOULD MORE ACCURATELY BASED ON LONGEVITY. TENURE WORK LOOK. THERE'S NO FUNDING ASSOCIATED WITH THIS REQUEST. AS IT DID SHIFT THE POSITION OF AUTHORITY WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT'S EXISTING BUDGET. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE SINCE HE WAS GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO IMPLEMENT TWO MAJOR NEW PROGRAMS. FIRST THE CALIFORNIA RICH PAYMENT PROGRAM OR CAP ADDRESSES THE HISTORIC LEVELS OF ENERGY THAT CALIFORNIA'S ACCRUED DURING THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC BY DIRECTING ONE BILLION IN FEDERAL AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT FUNDING. TO REDUCE PASSED TO ENERGY UTILITY BILL BALANCES. I AM EXTREMELY PROUD OF CSD STAFF AND OUR SMALL DEPARTMENTS ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY MISTER CAP UNDER COMPRESSED TIME FRAME ESTABLISHED IN THE BUDGET LAST YEAR CST USED EXISTING STAFF RESOURCES TO SUCCESSFULLY DISPERSED FUNDING THAT IS SUPPORTING OVER ONE POINT FIVE MILLION ENERGY CUSTOMERS PAY DOWN THEIR ENERGY DEATH. FURTHERMORE CST DISTRIBUTED ALL CAP FUNDING TO ENERGY UTILITIES BY THE JANUARY THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO STATUTORY DEADLINE. THAT CUSTOMERS HAVE BEEN RECEIVING CAP BILL CREDITS SINCE DECEMBER IN NEARLY ALL QUALIFIED CUSTOMERS HAVE NOW RECEIVED A CAPITAL CREDIT. WELL IT DID TAKE ADDITIONAL TIME TO NAVIGATE THE COMPLEXITIES OF SHARED UTILITY BILLING SYSTEMS AND ENSURING ALL ELIGIBLE UTILITIES RECEIVE THEIR SHARE OF CAP FUNDS IN ACCORDANCE WITH PROGRAM RULES. SHE SHE WAS ABLE TO NAVIGATE THOSE ISSUES ALONG WITH OTHER COMPLICATIONS INEVITABLY ARISE WHEN IMPLEMENTING A PROGRAM OF THE SCALE. ACCORDING CLOSELY WITH UTILITIES AND THEIR MEMBER ASSOCIATIONS TO QUICKLY AND COLLABORATIVELY ADDRESS ISSUES AS THEY AROSE AND ENSURE THE CAP BENEFITS RECEIVE OR REACHED CUSTOMERS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SURVEY TO DETERMINE THE STATUS OF PAST YOU BOUNCES AFTER CAP BENEFITS ARE APPLIED TO CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS. NOTE THAT POINT POINT IN TIME UTILITIES SURVEY RESULTS REFERRED FROM SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE ESTIMATED THE ONE BILLION IN CALIFORNIA WOULD ADDRESS ROUGHLY HALF OF THE TWO BILLION AN ELIGIBLE STATEWIDE ENERGY REAR JUST. AND CST ANTICIPATES UPDATED RICH DATA WILL BE AVAILABLE BY THE END OF APRIL. THE FINAL PHASE OF CAPITAL THE IMPLEMENTATION WILL INCLUDE UTILITIES REPORTING ON OUTCOMES INCLUDING DATA ON TOTAL FUNDS DISTRIBUTED. NUMBER OF CUSTOMER SERVICE AND AVERAGE BENEFIT AMONG OTHER DATA POINTS. FINAL REPORTING WILL BE PROVIDED TO THE LEGISLATURE IN THE FALL. AND UTILITY SURVEY AN ALLOCATION DATA BOTH STATEWIDE AND BY UTILITY ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE ON CSU'S WEBSITE. THROUGHOUT CAP SEIZE THE CLOSELY COORDINATED PROGRAMMABLE MAGICIAN WITH OTHER SOURCES OF ENERGY UTILITY RESEARCH ASSISTANCE AND GUIDANCE SUCH AS WITH WITH THE CPUC. ENERGY UTILITIES COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS AND STATE ASSOCIATIONS SUCH AS THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION. CAP IS JUST ONE PIECE OF THE STATE'S EFFORTS TO ADDRESS ENERGY DEBT INCURRED DURING THE PANDEMIC AND THESE EFFORTS TO PREDATE CAP AND WILL CONTINUE AFTER THE PROGRAM CONCLUDES. YOU SEE IF YOU SEE AN ENERGY UTILITIES HAVE TAKEN A NUMBER OF STEPS TO OFFER ASSISTANCE TO CUSTOMERS ECONOMICALLY IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC. THESE INCLUDE DISCONNECTION MORATORIUMS PAYMENT PLANS TO RAISE CUSTOMER DEBTS AND DISCOUNT PROGRAMS TO LOWER ONGOING ENERGY COSTS. OUTSIDE OF THE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS OFFERED UNDER CAP SHE IS THE OF PROVIDED ENERGY UTILITIES AND CUSTOMERS WITH INFORMATION ABOUT OTHER SOURCES OF ASSISTANCE FOR CUSTOMERS STRUGGLING TO PAY THEIR UTILITY BILLS. INCLUDING GST LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AS WELL AS CALIFORNIANS COBIT NINETEEN RENT RELIEF PROGRAM WHICH HAS PROVIDED FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR RENT AND UTILITIES TO INCOME ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIA RENTERS AND LANDLORDS. HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. FOR SEE LIKE PROGRAM PRAYER TWO HUNDRED AND THREE MILLION IN SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING FROM THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT. FIRST FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO REDUCE ENERGY BILL REAR JUST FOR LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. JUST IS ALSO IMPLEMENTING THE NEW FEDERAL LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLD WATER ASSISTANCE PROGRAM OR LIKE A WALK. UNDER MY WALK CALIFORNIA WAS ALLOCATED ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION AND ONE TIME FUNDING TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO ADDRESSED RESIDENTIAL WATER UTILITY COSTS. PER FEDERAL GUIDANCE WHAT I WANT IS MODELED ON THE LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM THE SERVICES ARE BEING DELIVERED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BY LIKE HEAP SERVICE PROVIDERS. CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE STATUTE ESTABLISHING MY WALK THE PROGRAM FOCUSES ON WATER AND WASTEWATER REAR JUST FOR LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. SEE IF YOU RECEIVE FINAL WHY WHAT STATE PLAN APPROVAL FROM FEDERAL OFFICIALS IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND WILL BE RELEASING FINAL PROGRAM GUIDELINES WITHIN THE NEXT WEEK. BERMAN IS ENTERING INTO CONTRACTS WITH LOCAL SERVICE PROVIDERS THIS MONTH WITH A CONTRACT START DATE OF APRIL FIRST. CST IS ALSO IN THE PROCESS OF ESTABLISHING DIRECT PAYMENT AGREEMENTS. WITH WATER AND WASTEWATER SYSTEMS TO MEET FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS THE BENEFITS BE PAID DIRECTLY TO WATER SYSTEMS. SERVICES UNDERLYING WHAT WILL BEGIN ON A ROLLING BASIS OF LOCAL SERVICE PROVIDERS RAMP UP THE WATER SYSTEMS ENTER INTO DIRECT PAY AGREEMENTS. SAID CSTS SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE NOT ADMINISTER WATER BENEFITS IN THE PAST THE DEPARTMENT IS INVESTED SIGNIFICANT UP FRONT TIME AND RESOURCES. TO DEVELOP Y. WAFFEN ENGAGE WITH WATER PROVIDERS IN ORDER TO ENSURE EFFECTIVE PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION AND SERVICE DELIVERY FOR CUSTOMERS ACROSS THE STATE. A PROGRAM LAUNCH. THIS IS INCLUDE REGULATED REGULAR CONSULTATION WITH THE CPC. AND THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. THE REALITY THAT WE ARE DEPENDENT ON WATER UTILITIES OPTING IN TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM THROUGH DIRECT PAY AGREEMENTS DOES CREATE SOME ANNOUNCER OUTSIDE DEPARTMENTS CONTROL. WITH THAT BEING SAID WE ARE CONFIDENT WE ARE LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM LAUNCH THANK YOU AND I'LL BE AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM ANGELES SHORT WITH THE L. L. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON ANGELES FOR WITH THE L. L. TODAY WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO REVIEW THE COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS INCLUDED IN OUR RECENT ANALYSIS OF CSU PROGRAMS. MUCH OF THIS ANALYSIS- YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN YOUR AGENDA AND OF COURSE STRUCTURE SCRIBNER JUST PROVIDED A VERY THOROUGH UPDATES ALL TRYING NOT TO BE TOO REPETITIVE HERE- AND I'LL JUST FOCUS. ON A FEW COMMENTS REGARDING- CAPTAIN LIE WALKED THE TWO MAJOR NEW PROGRAMS THAT CST HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTING IN THE CURRENT YEAR. FIRSTLY WE JUST WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE CSP'S FUNDING AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO OF MORE THAN ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IS  SIGNIFICANT AUGMENTATION- FROM THE DEPARTMENT'S. PRIOR YEAR BUDGETS AND THIS IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ONE BILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME FUNDING ALLOCATED FOR CAP. AND WHILE THIS IS QUITE A LARGE AUGMENTATION AS DR SCRIBNER ALSO MENTIONED CST WAS ABLE TO OVERCOME A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES APPLY LESSONS LEARNED. AND ULTIMATELY- STAND UP THE NEW PROGRAM QUITE QUICKLY- ADDITIONALLY THE DEPARTMENT HAS PROVIDED HAS BEEN PROVIDING. A DETAILED PROGRAM UPDATES AND INFORMATION ON ITS WEBSITE WHICH WE HAVE FOUND HAS GREATLY FACILITATED TRANSPARENCY AND ASSISTED- OUR ABILITY TO UP TO ASSIST THE LEGISLATURE WITH OVERSIGHT. ARE WE ALSO NOTED IN OUR IITIAL ANALYSIS THAT TOTAL CAP FUNDING OFFSETS ONLY AROUND HALF OF THE TOTAL CALCULATED ENERGY UTILITY- RIDGES IN THE STATE WHICH I DIRECTOR SCRIBNER ALSO MENTIONED. TOTAL AROUND TWO BILLION DOLLARS- WE EXPECT THAT CST IS FORTHCOMING REPORTING ON TAP- SHOULD SHED MORE LIGHT FOR THE LEGISLATURE. REGARDING WHO MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE BEEN SERVED OR OR WHO MAY HAVE REMAINING OR REEMERGES AFTER- EVEN AFTER CAP FUNDS WERE APPLIED. ADDITIONALLY WE NOTED IN OUR ANALYSIS THAT ENERGY UTILITY CUSTOMERS MAY BE RECEIVING DEBT RELIEF FOR THROUGH VARIOUS OTHER PROGRAMS INCLUDING STATE AND LOCALLY ADMINISTERED RENTAL- RELIEF FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND ACCORDINGLY WE HAD SUGGESTS THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO INQUIRE ABOUT HOW CST IS COORDINATING- CAP ASSISTANCE WITH THESE OTHER- POTENTIAL FORMS OF ASSISTANCE WHICH AT DIRECTOR SCRIBNER HAS HAS SPOKEN TO. AND MOVING ON JUST ONE FINAL COMMENT REGARDING LIE WALK UP- THE PRIMARY COMMENTS WE INCLUDED IN OUR INITIAL ANALYSIS WAS REGARDING IT- HOUSE CST IS COORDINATING WITH THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. GIVEN THAT THE STATE WATER BOARD- IS IMPLEMENTING A PROGRAM THAT SIMILARLY AIMS TO ASSIST RESIDENTIAL WATER AND WASTEWATER UTILITY CUSTOMERS TO ADDRESS THE REAR JUST- BUT WITH A SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER FUNDING ALLOCATION OF A ONE BILLION DOLLARS RELATIVE TO SEE S. D.'S- ONE HUNDRED SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS- FOR A LOT OF WHAT. BUT AGAIN- YOU KNOW DIRECTOR SCRIBNER HAS HAS SPOKEN A BIT TO THIS COORDINATION. SO THOSE ARE ALL OF MY INITIAL COMMENTS BUT HAPPY TO HELP RESPOND TO ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM KIA CHANDRA LELE BAKER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. A GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS AT THIS TIME WE DO NOT HAVE ANY CONCERNS OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT HERE THANK. THANK YOU WITHTHAT I WILL BRING IT BACK UP TO THE DIE S. I'M GONNA STICK WITH DIRECTOR SCRIBNER FIGHT CAN I. WANNA UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT BETTER THE LIE WHILE UP AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD PROGRAM. HOW THEY ARE DIFFERENTIATED WHETHER THEY'RE DUPLICATE AS FAR THEY SEPARATE I'M I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AS WELL AS- IF I CAN DO WE KNOW THE TOTAL OF A REAR EDGES FOR. WATER NEEDS FOR THE STATE- IN COMPARISON TO WHAT WE FUNDED FOR BOTH THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD AND LIVE OFF. SURE THE FROM WHAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE STATE WATER- THE THAT'S THE WATER BOARD'S PROGRAM IS REALLY JUST BEING PAID OFF AT THE UTILITY LEVEL SO THAT FUNDS WILL BE PROVIDED TO THE WATER UTILITIES THEMSELVES. WHERE HAS THE LIFELOCK IS BASICALLY A CUSTOMER BASED PROGRAM- THE CUSTOMER COMES INTO A LOCAL SERVICE PROVIDER WITH A BILL. THAT BILL CAN'T BE PAID HOWEVER THERE NEEDS TO BE A DIRECT PAY AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE WATER SERVICE PROVIDER THAT THE CUSTOMER. PAYS THEIR BILL TO. ARM AND THAT LOCAL SERVICE PROVIDER IN THE STATE BECAUSE THE STATE IS NOT ABLE TO PAY ANY. OF FUNDS DIRECTLY TO THE CONSUMER THEMSELVES OF MOSCOW TO THE WATER SERVICE PROVIDER SO THAT MADE EACH MAJOR DIFFERENTIAL IS THAT THE WATER BOARD'S PROGRAM IS THAT THE AS A LARGE UTILITY LEVEL THAT CAN TAKE. AN AGGREGATE NUMBER OF- RESEARCHES AND PAY THEM ALL AT ONCE WHEREAS LIVEWATCH IS A ONE CUSTOMER ONE APPLICATION APPROACH- THE L. IT'S A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED BECAUSE THEN WE HAVE TO ENTER TO ENTER INTO A MULTIPLE. DIRECT PAY AGREEMENTS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL- THIS QUESTION A FOR FINANCE IF THERE ARE UNSPENT FUNDS WITHIN THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. COULD THEY BE REPURPOSED TOWARDS A CARE LIKE PROGRAM TO ASSIST. WITH DISCOUNTED OR ADJUSTED WATER BILLS FOR LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS AS IT STILL ALONG THE SAME MODALITY OF CREATING AFFORDABILITY FOR THOSE WHO HAVE WATER NEEDS. IT'S NOT A PART OF FINANCE I THINK THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE TO- HAVE FOR THE CONVERSATIONS GOING TO SAVE- HOW THE ADMINISTRATION I WANT TO SPEND THE SAVINGS IF THEY'RE ALREADY. I WOULD. POINT OUT I BELIEVE THERE'S A SENATE BILL BY SENATOR DODD S. B. TWO TWO TWO THAT MAY CREATE. THE MECHANISM THAT IS THE CARE LIKE FOR. ADDRESSING SOME OF THE- LOW INCOME WATER USERS IN OUR STATE AS THE MODEL FOR US TO LOOK TOWARDS TO SEE IF IT'S APPLICABLE- AND WOULD LOVE. TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CURRENT FUNDS ARE WITHIN STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD THAT HAVE BEEN ON SPENT THUS FAR- AS WELL AS THE DENOMINATOR THAT WE TALKED ABOUT WHICH IS THE TOTAL FOR ME REGIS. THAT WILL BE NEEDED AS WELL- AND WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD OPEN ALL CST ISSUES PENDING ACTION AT THE MAY REVISION HEARINGS. AND WE WILL NOW TRANSITION TO PUBLIC COMMENT I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL OF. OUR PANELISTS. AS A REMINDER WE WELCOME PUBLIC COMMENTS ON ANY ISSUE WHICH IS ON THE AGENDA. WE DO HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT AND THEREFORE I WANT TO URGE YOU TO KEEP YOUR COMMENTS BRIEF. SO THAT WE CAN HEAR FROM EVERYONE. WE WILL START WITH IN PERSON PUBLIC COMMENT IN THE HEARING ROOM- IF YOU WILL PLEASE COME FORWARD TO MAKE A COMMENT- GOOD AFTERNOON. MICROBES IN HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION WHICH IS. YOUR PUBLICLY OWNED- MUNICIPAL WATER ELECTRIC UTILITIES. I'M REALLY I'M HERE ON THE LAST ITEM ON THE THIRD ITEM ONTHE CAP PROGRAM AND APPRECIATIVE OF- THE DIRECTORS- TESTIMONY WE THE CMU I THINK CST HAS DONE A WONDERFUL JOB ON THE CAP PROGRAM AND- AND- AND UNFORTUNATELY- AND I THINK THE TESTIMONY FROM BOTH THE L. A. ON THE DIRECTOR POINTED OUT THAT YOU CAN. THERE'S STILL SIGNIFICANT UNMET NEED THERE AND- AND YOU KNOW FOR THE FOR THE PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES ARE STILL THERE'S- YOU KNOW LAST YEAR SPENDING DID NOT COVERED IS JUST FOR THE PO USE. AT LEAST A HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS IN IN UNPAID BILLS FROM THE LAST CYCLE AND THEN AT LEAST ANOTHER THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS. SENSE SINCE THE PROGRAM- YOU KNOW THE CUT OFF DATE OF THE PROGRAM SO THAT SO THERE IS SIGNIFICANT UNMET NEED FROM FOR THE FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE WHO ARE WHO ARE NOT ABLE TO PAY THEIR ELECTRIC BILLS. WE THINK THERE IS A SOLUTION WE'VE BEEN- YOU KNOW REACHING OUT TO THE ADMINISTRATION AND HOPING YOU KNOW MAYBE THAT IN THE MAY REVISE AND IF NOT IN THE REVISED AND- THEN YOUR BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE CAN ENTERTAIN THE IDEA THAT. WHAT WE UNDERSTAND TO BE AT LEAST ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS LEFT OVER FROM- FROM THE FEDERAL MERICAN RESCUE ACT- FUNDS AND THAT YOU CAN GET. A THAT YOU HAVEN'T SPENT AND THAT YOU CAN REDIRECT- YOU KNOW SOME OF THAT MONEY. TO TO CAP AND OR TO THE GENERAL FUND AND- AND FUND THE UNMET NEED. AND WE'RE HOPING TO MAKE THAT- EFFORT TO REACH. IN THE BUDGET. AND HOPE YOU HELP WITH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE WILL NOW GO ON TO THE PHONE LINE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AS A REMINDER.
