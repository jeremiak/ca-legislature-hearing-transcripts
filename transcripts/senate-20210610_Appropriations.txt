I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE THIS MORNING- WELL RECOGNIZING THE URGENT NEED TO SUPPORT STUDENTS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC- WE CURRENTLY ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL IS TO CREATE SIGNIFICANT COST. LOCAL COSTS AND POTENTIAL REIMBURSABLE MANDATE AN ESTIMATED IN THE MILLIONS TO LIVE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND FOR LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. TO IMPLEMENT THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE STILL. WE NOTE MANY ELEAZAR OF ADOPTED POLICIES MANDATED BY THIS BILL IN ADDITION TO OTHER INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS IMPACTS OF THE PANDEMIC AND IMPROVE STUDENT GRADUATION RATES. ADDITIONALLY THE STATE'S ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM. THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DASHBOARD AND LOCAL CONTROL AND ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN REQUIRES SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO ROUTINELY EXAMINER LOCAL GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS TO ENSURE STUDENTS ARE SUPPORTED AND ABLE TO GRADUATE ON TIME. THANK YOU THANK YOU HAVING HEARD FROM FINANCE WILL BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO MEMBERS I KNOW MISTER WHITE HOUSE YOU HAVE A QUESTION. CARE FOR FINANCE. HOW IN THE WORLD CAN THIS COST HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS- PLEASE SHOW ME. ON THE ISSUE OF GREAT CHANGES. YOU KNOW A PARENT AT I MEAN MY WIFE IS WITH THE TEACHER I'M FAMILIAR WITH THE FREMONT UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT- SHE'S. THE ACADEMIC IS INSTRUCT AND STRUCTURE FOR MATH AND SCIENCE THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF CONFERENCES GOING ON BETWEEN PARENTS AND STUDENTS AND KIDS AT THE END OF THE SCHOOL YEAR. TO GET A GREAT. PLEASE EXPLAIN WHAT THE ACTUAL COST FOR THE GREAT CHANGES TO STUDENT SAYS I'M A STUDENT I GOT A C. IN BIOLOGY CAN YOU JUST. CHANGE IT TO A PASS WHAT IS THE COST OF THAT IN THE NEXT THREE WEEKS. AND WHAT'S YOUR CELL NUMBER UNDER HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. HI SENATOR THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SO WE'VE BROKEN UP THE NIGHT INTO TWO PIECES AT THE FIRST PIECE- IS REGARDING THE SUPPLEMENTAL RETENTION POLICY AND THE CONSULTATIONS AND FOR THAT WE DO HAVE A RANGE FROM AS LOW AS FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER ELLIE EIGHT DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF THE NBA. FOR THE OTHER CIVIC TO ELLIE IS THAT SERVE NINE THROUGH TWELFTH GRADERS- THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH THAT THAT ARE MANDATED ARE DEPOSED AND IMPLEMENT THE NEW POLICIES AROUND GREAT CHANGES AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE EXPANDEDACADEMIC OPPORTUNITIES TO STUDENTS NOT ON TRACK TO GRADUATE IN A TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY TWENTY TWO SCHOOL YEARS AND THOSE COSTS WE ESTIMATE COULD RANGE ANYWHERE FROM FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS REALLY EIGHT TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TRILLION OR MORE. AND THEY GET THAT DEPENDS ON THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE PROVIDED TO THE STUDENTS AND THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS UTILIZING THEM SO THERE IS A BROAD RANGE OF POTENTIAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE PROVISIONS THAT ARE. MANDATED IN A BILL THANK YOU IS SICK IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING WITH THE AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE IF THE DECISION IS MADE TO RETAIN THAT TRIAL THAT THAT AT THE GRADE LEVEL WHATEVER LEVEL OF MOVIE THEY STILL GET THE MONEY FOR THE. ATTENDANCE OF THE CHILD IN THE COMING YEAR. WE THAT A IF THERE ARE MORE STUDENTS. BUT LET'S SAY WE DON'T GRAD. X. NUMBER WE HAVE X. MINUS WHATEVER THAT THE VARIABLE IS WOULDN'T THEY RECEIVE THAT MONEY DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR TO PAY FOR THAT. THAT THE SERVICES. YOU'RE IN YOU'RE SAYING IT'S GOING TO COST MAYBE A SCHOOL DISTRICT A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS JUST TO MAKE THAT EVALUATION. AND CHANGE THE REGULATIONS. SENATOR I THINK THE COST TO BE DEPENDENT ON AGAIN THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT THIS WOULD IMPACT WHICH IS WHICH IS THAT. AND THEN THE LEVEL OF DETENTION OF SERVICES OR- EDUCATIONAL ACADEMIC OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE PROVIDED TO THAT STUDENT. OR GROUP OF STUDENTS WHICH WOULD PROBABLY VERY AND BE TAILORED TO THAT STUDENT- WHICH COULD. I THINK THE BILLS DESCRIBES IT AS NO UP COULD COULD INCLUDE- ADDITIONAL SUMMER CLASSES OF CREDIT. BY JUST A HOST OF DIFFERENT- OPPORTUNITIES- AND BECAUSE THE BILL REQUIRES THOSE. OUR CONCERN IS WITH THE POTENTIAL MANDATE ON ELLIE ACE IRRESPECTIVE OF YOU KNOW THE FUNDING THAT IS PROVIDED TO LIAISE WHETHER IT BE STATE OR FEDERAL MONIES AT THE FACT THAT WE'RE MANDATING IT. IN THIS IN THIS MEASURE WOULD NOT PRECLUDE PRECLUDE LEDS FROM FILING A MANDATE FOR REIMBURSEMENT WITH THE COMMISSION ON STATE MANDATES WOOL OKAY FINANCE THAT SAYS THEY'RE MANDATING IT BUT IF WE DID NOTHING WE KNOW THAT AFTER FIFTEEN YEARS FIFTEEN MONTHS IN DISTANT LEARNING THAT SOME MANY IT'S WELL PUBLICIZED THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE NOT LIVING IN A VACUUM THAT THE THESE KIDS ARE NOT SHOWING UP OR THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT GETTING. GETTING THERE YOU MEAN YOU MUST HAVE SEEN THIS COMING THAT THERE COULD BE THIS DECISION NOW THAT IT'S JUNE AND THE REPORT CARDS OR DO THAT SOMETHING NEEDED TO BE DONE AND THAT AND THAT THESE EACH AND EVERYONE OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAD SOME IDEA OF WHO THE NO SHOWS ON THE ON IT WITH THE KIDS THIS SHOULDN'T BE A SURPRISE- ON THE IMPACT THAT TAPPING IT THIS IS A LIFE LINE NIGHT IS I READ IT. TO SAY OKAY HERE'S A PROCEDURE TO GO THROUGHTHE WITH THE GRADES AND BE VERY FLEXIBLE ABOUT THE RETENTION AND THEN DO WHAT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD I MEAN IF. WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING THEY WOULD JUST. THEY HAVE TO DO SOME ANYWAY BUT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT WOULD HAVE TO MAKE THIS IS WHETHER THE KITTEN. GRADE OR PROMOTE THEM FIFTH. WE WOULDN'T BE DIZZY. WHEN HE SAID YOU HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT DID OUR THAT WERE EXPECTED TO COME. BECAUSE THEY HAD THEY WOULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING WITH IF WE WEREN'T HERE RIGHT NOW THE-EVERYONE AT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT'S DOING SOMETHING. I JUST WANNA BE SURE THAT YOUR NUMBER. IS THE ADDITIONAL COST BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE. WELL DO IT. THEY COULD HAVE DONE. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE THING THAT THEY WOULD JUST DO NOTHING BUT YOU'RE YOU'RE STICKING WITH A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS EXTRA TO DO THE WORK THAT THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO DO ANYWAY. OR DECISIONS THEY HAD TO MAKE ANYWAY. SARA YES IN ORDER TO ADDRESS YOUR FIRST YOUR FIRST ISSUE ON ON WHETHER OR NOT WE SAW THIS COMING- AS YOU KNOW- BACK IN FEBRUARY- THE LEGISLATURE PASSED AND GOVERNOR DID SIGN EIGHTY EIGHTY SIX WHICH PROVIDED FOUR POINT SIX BILLION AND ONETIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT ARE EXPECTED LEARNING- TO ADDRESS MANY MANY OF THE CONCERNS THAT ARE. INCLUDED IN THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL- WOULD SAY THAT AGAIN BECAUSE THE BILL. ON ITS ON ITS OWN AS A STATUTORY FRAMEWORK IS MANDATING. THESE REQUIREMENTS ON L. A.'S SO AGAIN WOULD NOT PRECLUDE THE ALLEY ACE FROM FROM FILING A MANDATE FOR REIMBURSEMENT FOR THESE REQUIREMENTS AS SET FORTH IN THE MAIL. I GUESS THAT THE PUBLIC SHOULD KNOW THAT THIS AB EIGHTY SIX THAT WE PASSD EARLIER THIS YEAR IS FOUR POINT SIX BILLION. FOR THE ALLEY ACE TO SUPPORT THE STUDENTS THAT WAS ONE OF THE CHALLENGE THAT WE GAVE WE GAVE EXAMPLES OF WHAT THE TO DO WITH THIS IN MY MIND. THEY SHOULD BE PATIENT EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE SEEN THIS COMING AND I'LL MAKE A MOTION AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO APPROVE IT MR CHERRY PREFIGURE INTELLIGENCE. THANK YOU- MISS UNDETERRED YOU WON'T HAVE ANY FINAL THOUGHTS COMMENT. THANK YOU CHAIR YOU'RE GOOD ALL RIGHT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS MR JONES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANTED TO FIND OUT WITH THIS SCHOOL YEAR ENDING. AND THE SCHOOLS GOING ON BREAK HOW DO YOU ENVISION. THE TEACHERS INTERACTING WITH THE PARENTS AND- GOING TO THIS CONVERSATION. WELL THIS BILL HAS BEEN IN PROCESS IN FACT- ALL OF IN FEBRUARY ALL OF THE- AB EIGHTY SIX CAME OUT OF A B. ONE OH FOUR IN ORDER TO DO THE FINDING PEACE. BUT WE ARE AT THAT MOMENT WHEN- THIS HAS TO PASS IF WE EXPECT THESE KINDS OF CONVERSATIONS TO BE HAD THE PROBLEM RIGHT NOW AND I CAN'T SAY EXACTLY HOW IT WOULD HAPPEN BUT THE PROBLEM RIGHT NOW IS. AN AND SOME PARENTS ARE THIS AND UNFORTUNATELY- CENTER WHITE HOUSE SKI THE TRUTH IS SOME DISTRICTS AREN'T GOING TO DO ANYTHING THERE ARE NUMBER OF DISTRICTS BECAUSE OF THEIR POLICY THAT IF YOU ASK THEM LOOK MY CHILD WAS NEVER ON ZOOM OR THE ZOOM WAS OFTEN THEY'RE RUNNING AROUND THE HOUSE I KNOW THAT THEY LOST A FULL YEAR OF INSTRUCTION THE SCHOOL WILL TELL YOU IT IS OUR POLICY. TO NOT- COULD DO SOCIAL PROMOTION RIGHT WE HAVE A POLICY AN ABSOLUTE. POLICY CAN'T EVEN TALK TO US ABOUT RETENTION. WE CAN EVEN HAVE THAT KIND. NOW SO YES THEY WOULD HAVE TO MAKE THEMSELVES AVAILABLE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THE TEACHER BY THE WAY THIS CONVERSATION SHOULD BE HAPPENING. WE SHOULD HAVE TO MANDATE THESE CONVERSATIONS UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN SOME SCHOOLS. THAT JUST HAVE A BRIGHT LINE SAY WE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT DON'T WORRY YOU GUYS GO UP IN SACRAMENTO AND SEND US MONEY. AND WE'LL FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT. WE JUST WANT TO GIVE PARENTS THE OPPORTUNITY THAT THEY HAVE. TO ACTUALLY CALL THE SCHOOL AND TALK TO SOMEBODY STARTING WITH THE PRINCIPAL AND FIGURING OUT HOW TO TALK TO THE TEACHER. AND FIGURE OUT THE BEST PATH FORWARD SOME SCHOOLS LIKE IN IN- IMPACTED IN OUR SHARED AREA. IF YOU WELL NOT EXACTLY SHARED BUT IT'S A NEW COUNTY. START SCHOOL AS EARLY AS JULY- RIGHT- AND SO YOU KNOW THAT CONVERSATION MAYBE IN THE BEGINNING HERE WE MAY HAVE SOME ADJUSTMENT PERIOD BUT IT'S A CONVERSATION THAT HAS TO HAPPEN. AND BY THE WAY WE'RE WORKING IN THE SCHOOL YEAR AND THEIR SENIORS WERE NOT GRADUATING AND DON'T REALIZE THAT THEY COULD STAY AN EXTRA YEAR. FOR PORTIONS OF THE YEAR IN ORDER TO GET THEIR HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GRADUATE WITH A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA AND FINISHING A G. E. D. IS EXTREME. AND SO THESE ARE THINGS THAT YES WE SHOULD HAVE DONE IT WAY BACK IN FEBRUARY HAVE AN URGENCY BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET IT THROUGH BUT WE NEED TO PROVIDE. OPPORTUNITIES AND CHOICES FOR PARENTS AND STUDENTS- TO HAVE HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY. SO THERE'S NOTHING IN YOUR BILL THAT. YOUR BILL IS SILENT TOO. IF THE SCHOOLS ON BREAK AND THE TEACHERS ON BREAK- M. INNER. YOU CAN. TEACHER BECOME. TO COME BACK. DOWN THIS KIND. OR I I'M I'M IN. TO ARE GONNA WANT TO HAVE KIND. SO THERE. BUT THERE'S GOING TO BE OUTLYING SITUATIONS WHERE TEACHERS I'M ON BREAK I'M NOT AVAILABLE. HOW TO USE. IT A BILL I THINK IS SILENT AS I TRACK IT IS THE ONLY PROBABLY BE CONDITIONAL COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND- I ASSUME AT THE LOCAL LEVEL HOWEVER THE CONVERSATION HAS TO TAKE PLACE RIGHT. AND THAT'S THE POINT WE'RE TRYING TO PUSH IN A LOT OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE STARTED. TALKING ABOUT THIS KID BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE BILL IS COMING IN AND WE THINK THAT'S A POSITIVE THING. EVEN IF THE CONVERSATION TAKES PLACE RIGHT WHEN- SCHOOL STARTS AGAIN. WITH THAT TEACHER RIGHT WHEN THEY COME BACK A FEW WEEKS BEFORE SCHOOL THERE'S NOTHING TO PREVENT. THAT THAT TEACHER. THE ADMINISTRATOR AT THE PARENT DECIDING THE SCHOOL THE- CHILD SHOULD START BACK IN FIRST GRADE AND UP. ME ONE SECOND GRADE WELL I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT UP THE POINT ON SOME OF THESE SCHOOL DISTRICTS BEING. EIGHTY EIGHT NOT WANTING AT ALL TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT RETENTION AND. I THINK- MEET MAYBE INTENTION OR ANY. USED IN A POOR. NERVE THERE THAT I WOULD LOVE TO CAN. TO COME. ON THIS MAY BE SURPRISING TO SEVERAL PEOPLE HERE BUT I WAS HELD BACK. IN THE THIRD GRADE- I'M BORN I WAS BORN IN AUGUST- SO FROM KINDERGARTEN THROUGH THIRD GRADE I WAS THE I. I WAS ALWAYS BEHIND- WE I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT UPON US AS LEADERS IN CALIFORNIA THAT OUR VALUE EDUCATION. FOR SOME REASON THERE'S BECOME A STIGMA. AND PARENTS EGOS GET IN THOUGH AND I'VE HAD THE SAME I'VE HAD THIS PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH FRIENDS OF MINE THAT HAVE REFUSED TO HOLD THEIR KIDS BACK- BECAUSE THEY TOOK IT AS A STIGMA OR A- THEY FAILED OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THE U. TWO PARENTS DON'T FAIL. WHEN THEIR KIDS NEED TO BE HELD BACK THE KIDS JUST NOT READY TO GO TO MOVE ON AND THAT HAPPENS- IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT MALCOLM GLADWELL WROTE A BOOK CALLED THE OUTLIERS THE STORY OF SUCCESS. IN PART ONE OF THE STUDIES IN THAT BOOK IS HE LOOKED AT WHAT MADE- IS CERTAIN CANADIAN YOUTH HOCKEY TEAMS MORE SUCCESSFUL OR PLAYERS MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN OTHER. YOUTH HOCKEY PLAYERS AND WHAT HE FOUND OUT WAS THE KIDS THAT WE WENT INTO KINDERGARTEN AT A LATER AGE. ACTUALLY ARE THE-ONES THAT EXCELLED AND BECAME THE BETTER PLAYERS. WHICH WHEN YOU LOOK AT LIKE. YOU DON'T THINK OF THIS BUT SOON AS IT'S OUT IN THE BOOK IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE THESE KIDS ARE SIX MONTHS TO TWELVE MONTHS YEARS- TWELVE MONTHS OLDER THAN THE OTHER KIDS OF COURSE ARE GOING TO EXCEL. AND DO BETTER SO- YOU KNOW MAYBE. WE NEED TO BE ALSO IN ADDITION TO THIS AND I'M SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY- IN ADDITION TO THIS WE MAYBE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT SOME POLICY ISSUES NEXT YEAR. WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT. HAVE THAT ATTITUDE THAT I THINK WE NEED TO START DRESSING AND REMOVING THE STIGMA OF CHILDREN BEING HELD BACK. SOMETIMES THAT'S THE VERY BEST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN TO HIM. FOR ME- I DID THIRD GRADE TWICE WHEN I GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL I WAS IN THE TOP 10% OF MY CLASS. WENT ON IMMEDIATELY TO COLLEGE. AND THAT WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED IF I HAD NOT BEEN HELD BACK SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AT. SHOULD THE CHAIR AND THE AUTHORS INDULGENCE. ON THE- POLICY DISCUSSION THANK YOU. WE HAVE HAD A ROBUST CONVERSATION TODAY I SEE NO OTHER HANDS WHAT. WE FELT MS CALM WATER. STARTED INTO YOUR HANDS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I HAVE A QUESTION I THINK FOR BOTH THE AUTHOR AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE FIRST QUESTION SORT OF BUILDING ON WHAT. FROM THE SENATOR FROM FREMONT WAS. RAINING ON IS THE ESTIMATE OF THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS IS THAT BASED ON. THE ASSUMPTION THAT EVERY CHILD IN THE SYSTEM. WE'LL BE USING THE SUPPORT. AND WHERE IS THE ESTIMATE COMING FROM. HI SENATOR THIS IS JULIE ON AIR WITH APARTMENT FINANCE FOR THE S. MI. RANGE BASED ON EACH OF THE LEDS PARTIES. HELLO MY M. I NEEDED NO. WE CAN HEAR YOU I HEAR YOU OKAY THANK YOU. AT IT'S A HIGH LEVEL ESTIMATE BASED ON EACH ELLIE A PARTICIPATING IN EACH OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE BILL STARTING FROM A LOW RANGE FOR AN ALLEY A. FOR THE FIRST PORTION OF THE BILL REGARDING- THE RETENTION ISSUE OF A LOW FIVE HUNDRED. SMALLEY ELLIE EIGHT TO. FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS- FOR A LARGER LED AND THE SAME THING FOR THE SECOND PART OF THE BILL REGARDING A GREAT CHANGES IN PROVIDING EXPANDED ACADEMIC OPPORTUNITIES TO STUDENTS IT'S AT THE ALLEY A LEVEL- RANGING FROM A LOW OF FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS- TWO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. I DON'T HAVE MORE GRANULARITY THAN THAT THEN IT'S BASED ON- BATTLE AND FOR THE SECOND WHERE THERE IS A MUCH WIDER RANGE OF COSTS FROM FIVE THOUSAND TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR VERY LARGE L. EA- IT IS IT HAS BEEN REDUCED FOR NOT ALL LEDS BECAUSE NOT ALL AT LEAST SERVE NINE THREE TWELFTH GRADERS SO THAT HAS BEEN REDUCED TO ABOUT ONE THIRD OF. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. SO IT'S BASED ON THE SIZE OF THE ALLEY A NOT NECESSARILY THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS. AND I WOULD ADD IT. YOU KNOW IT'S AN ESTIMATED RANGE AND IT IS UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME HOW MANY STUDENTS YOU KNOW WOULD BE UTILIZING- ADDITIONAL SERVICES AND WHAT THOSE SERVICES WOULD BE. DEPENDENT ON THE L. OKAY AND THEN FOR CLARIFICATION. IT'S FOR. IS IT I READ IT FOUR HI FOLKS KIDS ARE IN HIGH SCHOOL BUT IT'S FOR EVERY STUDENT THAT HAPPEN TO BE ENROLLED. IN CLASS DURING THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SCHOOL YEAR. RETENTION THREE TENSION QUESTION FOR ME OR FOR THE ODD FUNNELED INTO THE OFFICE AND THE RETENTION PIECE IS ALL GRADES THE ADDITIONAL YEAR TO GRADUATE IS FOR OBVIOUSLY ELEVENTH AND TWELFTH GRADERS AND THEY PASS NO PASS IS NINE THREE TWELVE GRADES UP DEFECTOR COLLEGE ADMISSIONS OKAY GREAT THANK YOU THAT WAS HELPFUL. AND THEN YOU KNOW- DEPARTMENT OF ANY THE- THIS PART OF THE CORE I WAS ASKING YOU KNOW THE FIRST PART WAS ABOUT SORT OF THE ESTIMATE BUT MY ASSUMPTION IS THAT REGARDLESS OF IF THEIR DISTRICTS THAT ARE- MAKING THESE KINDS OF SUPPORTS AVAILABLE THAT ALL DISTRICTS STILL HAVE SYSTEMS IN PLACE ON INFRASTRUCTURE COULD YOU COULD HAVE AN INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE AND YOU'RE JUST DECIDING THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO. ACTIVATE IT- SO IS THIS SORT OF TAKING THAT INTO CONSIDERATION OR IS THIS OUR ESTIMATES ALSO SORT OF PREDICATED ON THE FACT THAT SOME ELITE LIAISE DON'T HAVE ANY OF THIS. THE SUPPORTS IN PLACE AT ALL- AND HAVE TO BUILD THAT IN. SENATOR I'D HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON ON THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL OF THE ESTIMATE. IF THAT'S OKAY OKAY BECAUSE I MEAN YOU KNOW THE REALITY IS WHILE WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY STUDENTS WOULD BE USING THIS WE CERTAINLY KNOW. THAT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS DIDN'T CHECK IN AT ALL- AND I THINK THAT'S THE THING THAT'S MOST CONCERNING TO SO MANY OF US THOSE THAT ARE PARENTS WHO HAVE KIDS THAT ARE GOING TO SCHOOL. AND THOSE THAT ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT OUR YOUNG FOLKS GETTING THE EDUCATION THAT THEY RIGHTLY DESERVE FROM THIS STATE- SO. YEAH I WOULD BE GREAT IF YOU COULD GET BACK TO US ON THOSE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR LAYERED- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANT TO SAY TWO THINGS ONE IS IT. JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT THE FINANCE PROJECTIONS ARE COMPLETELY UNREALISTIC AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO PUT THAT ON THE RECORD SHOW THAT WHEN WE TALK TO SPILL OUT. NOBODY READS THAT- AS AN AGREEMENT IN JUST HOW OVERBLOWN THOSE WERE. THE SECOND THING IS IN READING ANALYSIS ONE THING PUSH MY BUTTONS A LITTLE I FEEL THE NEED TO SAY IT. THAT SET UP ARE YOU GOT A COLLEGE DEGREE WITHOUT GRADES- YOU KNOW DID NOT GET A LETTER GRADE WAS NOT REDUCED TO A NUMBER AND NOTHING MADE ME CRAZIER THAN PEOPLE FREAKING OUT SAYING OH MY GOD THEY DON'T HAVE GRADES WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WE CAN'T PROCESS THEM. MY COLLEAGUES WORK FOR THE PRO TEM WERE LEGISLATORS WERE DOCTORS OR LAWYERS FOR EVERYTHING ELSE ENTREPRENEURS VERY SUCCESSFUL AND WE WEREN'T REDUCED TO GRADE SO FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE FREAKING OUT BECAUSE GRADES ON SHOW UP THEY JUST NEED TO GET OVER IT ALL HAPPEN. WOULD BE AN IPHONE. OUR WE HAVE HAD A- CONVERSE- MS GONZALEZ WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A CLOSE I WOULD AND- I APOLOGIZE I'M NOT AN EDUCATIONAL EXPERT I'M JUST A PARENT WHO HAPPENS TO HAVE STAYED HOME LAST YEAR WITH THREE KIDS. AND SEEN THE CHALLENGES THAT NOT ONLY THEY HAD PUT THEIR FRIENDS HAD DURING THIS PAST YEAR AND THAT'S NINETEEN COUNTS BUT GOD KNOWS HOW MANY PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT WHO NEVER EVEN TURNED ON A COMPUTER MAYBE THEY DIDN'T HAVE IT MAYBE THEY DIDN'T HAVE A CONNECTIVITY MAYBE THEY WERE WORKING BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS COULDN'T. THIS IS A TIME OF JUST UNFORESEEN- CIRCUMSTANCES FOR OUR STUDENTS AND ALTHOUGH I APPRECIATE- MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO WE SHOULD HAVE A LARGER DISCUSSION I AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT BUT THAT'S NOT THE DISCUSSION HERE THIS IS JUST ABOUT BEING ABLE TO HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. WE ALLOCATED FOUR POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS TO EIGHTY EIGHTY SIX FOR THESE VERY SUPPORTS THE REQUIRED TO HAVE THESE VERY SUPPORTS FOR OUR KIDS. DO WE THINK THAT THAT THAT. THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO INSTANTLY THEY'RE GOING TO NEED MORE MONEY FOR SUPPORT BUT THESE ARE JUST THE SUPPORTS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW INSURED THE KIDS ARE ACTUALLY GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL SO THEY GET THAT DIPLOMA AND THEY DON'T GET A GED. ENSURING THAT KIDS ARE. YOU KNOW NOT LOSING FIRST OR SECOND GRADE LOSING FIRST GRADE WE KNOW WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IN SECOND GRADE IF YOU'RE NOT IN THE SECOND GRADE READING LEVEL WE TALKED ABOUT THAT ALL THE TIME- WE CERTAINLY GONNA PRETEND. THAT THAT DOESN'T MATTER. WE OWE IT TO OUR CHILDREN AND TO OUR- PARENTS IT REALLY TORE TEACHERS AS WELL. TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PUT KIDS IN THE BEST POSSIBLE SITUATION. AND MY HEART GOES OUT HAVING JUST GONE THROUGH THE- THECOLLEGE PROCESS WITH MY EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD YOU KNOW. YOU JUST COULDN'T LEARN. LIKE LET'S SAY YOU WERE STRAIGHT A STUDENT JUST COULDN'T LEARN FOREIGN LANGUAGE. BY ZOOM WELL SUDDENLY YOU CAN'T GET INTO IT AND EVERYBODY KNOWS FROM THE COLLEGES TO UC OR CSU BECAUSE- YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT ONE BAD MARK ON YOUR ON YOUR REPORT CARD. WHEN IT COULD JUST BE A PASS NOT BE CONSIDERED IN YOUR GPA WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT BECAUSE TIMES ARE DIFFERENT. AND SO I APPRECIATE ALL THE COMMENTS HERE- I APPRECIATE THAT. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE CLEARLY DOESN'T LIKE THE BILL BUT I THINK WE OWE IT TO ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS TO PASS IT SO. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NIGHT. THANK YOU FOR THAT PASSIONATE CLOSE MISTER WHITE HOUSE GIVE YOU WANT TO MAKE THE MOST. TO MOVE. WE HAVE A MOTION FROM MISTER CASKEY THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO PASS. AND.
