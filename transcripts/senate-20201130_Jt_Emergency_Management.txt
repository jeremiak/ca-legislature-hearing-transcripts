I WOULD LIKE TO START OFF TODAY BY THANKING THE SPEAKER AND PRO TEM AND OUR AMAZING STAFF FOR MAKING THIS HEARING HAPPENED TODAY. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK OUR PANELISTS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR TAKING THE TIME OUT OF THEIR BUSY SCHEDULES TO PARTICIPATE TODAY. UP THE PAST FOUR YEARS HAVE SEEN CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES FLOODS. AND DEBRIS SLIDES THAT HAVE COST CALIFORNIANS THEIR LIVES AND DESTROYED TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN PROPERTY LOSSES. THIS YEAR SAW OVER FOUR MILLION ACRES BURNED AND THE YEAR IS NOT EVEN OVER YET. MANY OF THESE DEATHS AND INJURIES COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED HAD OUR EMERGENCY ALERT AND NOTIFICATION SYSTEM. SYSTEMS BEEN EFFECTIVE AND FUNCTION FUNCTIONING PROPERLY. THERE WERE PROBLEMS WITH MESSAGING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NOT PREPARED TO SEND ALERTS A FAILURE OF OUR NOTIFICATION SYSTEMS TO BE ABLE TO REACH EVERYONE. THE INHERENT VULNERABILITY AND LIMITATIONS IN OUR SYSTEMS AND FINALLY TO INDIVIDUALS NOT OPTING INTO ALERTS ARE TAKING APPROPRIATE ACTION ONCE THEY RECEIVE THEM. WHILE OUR OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE TO BE COMMENDED FOR MAKING GREAT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE PAST FEW YEARS WE ARE STILL NOT WHERE WE SHOULD BE. WE'RE STILL EXPERIENCING PROBLEMS TODAY'S HEARING ON EMERGENCY ALERTS AND EVACUATION WILL FOCUS ON SPECIFIC ISSUES RELATED TO EMERGENCY ALERTS AND EVACUATION. FOR ALERTS HOW DO WE IMPROVE OUR SYSTEMS HOW DO WE ACCOMPLISH RESILIENCE AND REDUNDANCY. HOW DO WE GET ACCURATE AND TIMELY INFORMATION ALERTS OUT TO CALIFORNIANS BEFORE AND DURING MANDATORY EVACUATIONS. CALIFORNIA ALWAYS RESPONDS TO DISASTERS AND ADJUST TO THE NEW TWIST AND TURNS THAT ARE THROWN AT US I'M CONCERNED THAT OUR EMERGENCY ALERTS AND EVACUATIONS THAT WE ARE PREPARED FOR OUR FUTURE. AND THAT WE ARE PREPARED FOR A FUTURE WORST CASE SCENARIOS. BEFORE WE START THE HEARING. OF I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK QUICK MOMENT TO ACKNOWLEDGE SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN A PILLAR OF THIS INSTITUTION FOR MANY YEARS. BY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT TODAY IS SENATOR HANNAH BETH JACKSON'S FINAL DAY IN THE LEGISLATURE. SHE HAS BEEN CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE AND HAS CONTRIBUTED A LOT. NOT ONLY TO EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT BUT TOO MANY ISSUES THAT AFFECT CALIFORNIANS IN AS HER AS- DURING HER TIME IN IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE.

TO THE OREGON BORDER SENATOR MCGUIRE'S DISTRICT HAS BEEN SUBJECTED TO SOME OF THE WORST FIRES IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. SENATOR REQUIRED THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AND AS THE VICE CHAIR- WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE OPENING REMARKS. THANK YOU SO MUCH AT MADAM CHAIR I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE CHAIRWOMAN FOR HER DEDICATED WORK ON THESE CRITICAL ISSUES. VERY VERY GRATEFUL MADAM CHAIR AND HONORED TO BE ABLE TO PARTNER WITH YOU HERE THIS MORNING AND GOOD MORNING TO EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU. MADAM CHAIR LOOK I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF WILDLAND FIRE VINCE IN CALIFORNIA. THEY'RE GETTING WORSE THESE PAST FIVE YEARS ARE LIKE NOTHING THAT WE HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE. WHETHER YOU'RE ONE OF THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS WHO WERE EVACUATED OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS THE TENS OF THOUSANDS. WHO LOST THEIR HOME OR THE DOZENS WHO LOST A LOVED ONE THESE MEGA WHILE AND FIRES HAVE CHANGED THE WAY WE LIVE IN CALIFORNIA. THERE ARE SEVERAL LESSONS THAT WE HAVE LEARNED FROM THIS ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATING HALF DECADE IN ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT IS THE DESPERATE NEED FOR COMPREHENSIVE AND EFFECTIVE EMERGENCY ALERTS. LIVES TRULY DEPEND ON IT IT'S CLEAR THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT SHORTCOMINGS IN OUR EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM AND RESIDENTS DESERVE RESIDENTS DESERVE TIMELY NOTIFICATIONS AND UP TO DATE INFORMATION. SERVER YOUR YEARS AGO EACH OF THE GOLDEN THE STATE'S COUNTIES WERE DEPLOYING ALERTS DFFERENTLY IN SOME CANDIDLY NOT DEPLOYING ANY AT ALL. THIS LEFT TENS OF MILLIONS OF LIES VULNERABLE TO AN IMPENDING DISASTER. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THIS LEGISLATURE PASSED SB THREE THREE WHICH CREATED STATEWIDE EMERGENCY EVACUATION ALERT GUIDELINES THIS LEGISLATION ALSO DEVELOPED MANDATED TRAININGS FOR LOCAL EMERGENCY MANAGERS ON HOW TO EMPLOYEE. DEPLOY ALERTS AND WARNINGS THE LEGISLATURE ALSO PASSED CRITICAL LEGISLATION IN YEARS PAST FOR TELECOMMUNICATION OUTAGE REPORTING. AND IT'S NOW LA THE LAND IF THERE'S A TELECOMMUNICATION ADAGE WIRELESS OR WIRELINE. TELECOMMUNICATIONS TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES ARE NOW MANDATED REPORT THESE OUTAGES TO LOCAL EMERGENCY MANAGERS IN THE STATE OFFICE EMERGENCY SERVICES IN NO LESS THAN SIXTY MINUTES. PRIOR TO THIS TELECOMMUNICATION OUTAGES WOULD TAKE PLACE ALERTS WOULD BE SENT OUT AND NO ONE WAS AWARE THAT THE PUBLIC WHO ARE IN DANGER WEREN'T RECEIVING THESE ALERTS SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE. NOW THERE ARE STILL SHORTCOMINGS THAT WE MUST ADDRESS AND I AM GRATEFUL TO THE CHAIRMAN FOR CONVENING AS TODAY WHICH IS SO CRITICAL. THAT WE NEED TO ENSURE THE. SEVEN TWO HOUR BACKUP POWER RULES FOR CELL PHONE TOWER STICKS THAT RECENTLY PASSED BY THE PUBLIC. COMMISSION AND WE NEED TO ADVANCE THE SAME PROTECTIONS FOR WIRE LINES AND AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE ALSO NEED TO EXAMINE HOW WE CAN IMPROVE EVACUATIONS WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW AN IF WE BUILD IN HE MOST. SEVERE HIGH FIRED SEVERITY ZONES. FOR THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE WE NEED STATEWIDE POLICY AND MANDATED FIRE BREAKS AROUND DEVELOPMENTS MANDATED PRIMARY AND SECONDARY ROADS FOR NEW DEVELOPMENTS. NO MORE ONE WAY AND ONE WAY OUT FOR ROADS IN THE WILL WE- ALL THE ALERTING CAPABILITY IN THE WORLD DOESN'T MAKE UP FOR TRYING TO EVACUATE ENTIRE AREAS ON A SINGLE SMALL ROAD. IN AGAIN WE ARE SO APPRECIATIVE THAT CHAIRWOMAN FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS AND FOR BRINGING LIGHT TO THIS CRITICAL ISSUE. FINALLY MADAM CHAIR AND LIKE TO BE ADDED KNOWLEDGE SENATOR JACKSON IS YOU ELOQUENTLY JUST DID AS WELL. AT THIS IS GOING TO BE HER FINAL JOINT COMMITTEE.

CENTER JACKSON'S DISTRICT HAS BEEN FROM HELL AND BACK HOW DO TO THESE MEGA WHILE THEN FIRES AND MUD SLIDES. SHE HAS BEEN A CHAMPION TO BE ABLE TO UPDATE ANTIQUATED EMERGENCY ALERT STANDARD LAWS ADVANCE NEW BUILDING STANDARDS THAT WILL HELP KEEP CALIFORNIANS SAFE AND A MEGA FIRE. FIGHTING FOR RESOURCES FOR CALIFORNIA LOCAL FIREFIGHTING AGENCIES WHEN I SAY THAT SHE IS GOING TO BE DEARLY MISSED THAT IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT. AND SENATE JACKSON WE ARE GRATEFUL GRATEFUL FOR YOUR LIFETIME. SERVICE TO ONE OF QUALITY. TO FIGHTING FOR THOSE WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE IN THREE STANDING STRONG FOR FIRE SURVIVORS.

GOOD MORNING HOPEFULLY YOU CAN HEAR ME OKAY GOOD MORNING YES WE CAN. EXCELLENT JERRY VESTS RIGHT CARE MCGUIRE CENTER JACKSON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT ALONGSIDE OR CALIFORNIA OR PUBLIC SAFETY AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT COLLEAGUES ON THE ROLE OF HELLO YES IN THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE OF EMERGENCY ALERTS WARNINGS AND EVACUATION. AGAIN MY NAME IS TINA CURRY AND I AM THE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR HERE AT HELLO YES. SO JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW HOW WE'RE ORGANIZED ON JUST ABOUT ALL DISASTERS EMERGED AND AT PRESENT THEMSELVES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND SO YOU KNOW LONG WITHOUT LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAVE SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES TO SEND EMERGENCY ALERTS AND WARNINGS TO THEIR COMMUNITY MEMBERS. HELLO YES ALSO HAS A ROLE IN A LEARNING MORNING WE HAVE A- CALIFORNIA STATE WARNING CENTER THAT IS STAFFED TWENTY FOUR SEVEN AND IS IN CONSTANT COMMUNICATION WITH WHAT WE CALL FORTY POINTS AT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL LEVEL ALL THE TIME THEY'RE RELAYING THINGS. LIKE WEATHER WARNINGS AND OTHER TYPES OF. CRITICAL INFORMATION WHICH THEN IT EXTENDED TO THE PUBLIC. AND ALSO CONSISTENT WITH CALLAS IS ROLE TO SUPPORT LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN ALL FACETS OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT BEFORE DURING AND AFTER THE STATE ALSO PROVIDES A ROLE IN THE A LEARNING LEARNING SPACE- TRAINING. GUIDANCE AND PROVIDING A PLATFORM CONSERVE OUR CONSISTENCY ACROSS JURISDICTIONS AND TO ACCESS TOOLS SUCH AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S INTEGRATED PUBLIC ALERT AND WARNING SYSTEM OR IPODS IN ORDER FOR TO THAT TO THAT ACKERMAN OPPORTUNITY TIMES. THE ISSUE OF ALERTS OR WARNINGS AND EVACUATIONS AS ADULT THE CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR LEADER TO OBVIOUSLY TOOK CENTER STAGE AFTER SERIOUS SERIES OF CATASTROPHIC EVENTS TRAGICALLY CLAIMING LIVES DURING THE TO SET THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WILDFIRES AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT EVENTS IN CALIFORNIA. WE KNEW MORE NEEDED TO BE DONE. THE STATE LEVERAGED ITS STANDARDIZED EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN IN PLACE AS A PROGRAM. I FOUNDATION FOR EMERGENCY MAN AND CAL. FOR DECK. AND WE FORM TO THE- COLOR AND WARN WHAT WE CAN SPECIAL COMMITTEE. BACKED COMMITTEE AS REPRESENTATIVES FROM ALL ALL CORNERS OF CALIFORNIA ALL THE REGIONS OF THE STATE STATE GOVERNMENT- AND IT'S SAD REALLY CALIBRATED TO WORK TOGETHER WORK THROUGH ISSUES IMPROVEMENTS AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. THAT'S THE BODY ULTIMATELY DEVELOP TO THE ALERT AND WARNING GUIDELINES AS REQUIRED BY YOUR BILL CENTER REQUIRE EIGHT THIRTY THREE. AND THESE ARE PUBLISHED BACK IN MARCH OF TWENTY NINETEEN. THERE IS NOTHING- SOLUTION THAT WILL WORK THE SAME WAY AND EVERY INCIDENT WE KNOW THIS AND PUBLIC SAFETY AND EMERGENCY SERVICES SOMEONE OF IMPORT MOST IMPORTANT COMPONENTS OF THE GUIDANCE. IS EMPHASIS ON THE USE OF MULTIPLE SYSTEM SO THAT WE ARE COMPREHENSIVE AND REDUNDANT AND THEN WITH THIS VERY CRITICAL STATUS OF ALERTING AND WARNING. ALONG THOSE LINES ONE OF OUR GOALS WAS TO ENHANCE THE USE OF WIRELESS EMERGENCY ALERTS ARE WE OUT WE HAS ONE OF THE- FACETS OF THE IPOD SYSTEM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SYSTEM THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER. SINCE PUBLISHING THE GUIDELINES IN TWENTY NINETEEN HELLO YES AS APPROVED. A HUNDRED TWENTY THREE WHAT WE CALL ALERTING AUTHORITIES STATEWIDE. IN ALL OF OUR HAVE ACCOUNT. AND THIS IS UP FROM ABOUT A YEAR AGO WE HAD WE PRESENTED ON THIS TOPIC TO THE LEGISLATURE AND WE WERE ABOUT IT ABOUT EIGHTY EIGHT ALERTING AUTHORITIES- DURING THE REASON THESE RECENT FIRES AS ALERTING AUTHORITIES DISSEMINATED OVER THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PLUS ALERTS AND WARNINGS TO THE PUBLIC. WHAT IS AN ALERTING AUTHORITY THIS IS A FEMALE TERM SO ESSENTIALLY THE JURISDICTION THAT HAS SIGNED ON AND DEMONSTRATED THEIR ABILITY TO UTILIZE THE IPOD SYSTEM. AND HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO SEND ALERTS OR WARNINGS TO THE PUBLIC SO BIG PART OF OUR WORK IS TO. HELP COMMUNITIES- HAVE ACCESS TO THAT SYSTEM RIGHT NOW ACCORDING TO FEMA. THERE ARE MORE THAN FIFTEEN HUNDRED MATCHING NOT ACROSS THE NATION FEDERAL STATE LOCAL TRIBAL AND TERRITORIAL OR ALERTING AUTHORITIES ARE USING THE- IPOD SYSTEM. MESSAGE THAT BY LEARNING AUTHORITIES RANGE FROM WIRELESS EMERGENCY ALERTS- OVER THE EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM R. EA ASKED THAT MANY ARE FAMILIAR WITH. FOR THINGS LIKE EVACUATIONS OR OTHER EMERGENCY ACTIONS THAT PEOPLE NEED TO TAKE. THESE SYSTEMS ARE ALSO USED FOR THINGS LIKE TSUNAMI AND WEATHER WARNINGS AND TO RELATE THOSE TO THE PUBLIC AND ABOUT A YEAR AGO CALIFORNIA BEGAN USING WE ASK WIRELESS EMERGENCY ALERTS AS ONE OF THE SEVERAL DELIVERY SYSTEMS FOR. EARTHQUAKE EARLY WARNING WHICH IS A NEW TECHNOLOGY AND CALIFORNIA. WE HVE COVERAGE OF BANDAGES AS WE KNOW AS THE TECHNOLOGY IS EMBEDDED IN ALL CELLPHONES REQUIRES AN OPT OUT IN ORDER TO NOT RECEIVE THEM SO THE MESSAGE GO AUTOMATICALLY UNLESS THE- US CELL PHONE SUBSCRIBER YOU OPT OUT. BUT WE HAS ALSO HAVE LIMITATIONS. THERE CAN BE BELIEVE OVER HOUSING PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF THE INTENDED AREA TO RECEIVE ALERTS AND BECAUSE ANDY PADDOCK. SAID THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION- TOOK ISSUE WITH THIS IN NOVEMBER THIRTIETH IS ARE DEADLINE. OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS TO REFINE WE ACCURACY SO AS OF NOVEMBER THIRTIETH I'VE AND NUMBER THIRTY YET- WE HAVE NEED TO BE ACCURATE WITHIN ONE TENTH OF A MILE FOR THE INTENDED NOTIFICATION AREA SO WERE WERE LITERALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT. SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT. AT UCLA YES AND WE ARE IN THE SYSTEMS THEY DEPEND ON. ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO DESTRUCTION BUT STATUS POWER SUPPLY WILDFIRES THE SYSTEM RESILIENCY REDUNDANCY ARE INSTRUMENTAL TO THIS CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT AND CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AS YOU ALREADY ALLUDED TO- CPUC HAS ISSUED. NEW RULES REGARDING POWER REDUNDANCY. FOR COMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS. WE OFTEN HEAR ABOUT TECH CHEN THE IPOD IT'S SOME IS MANY DOES OUT AS WE IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S USED ALL THE TIME. AND THAT'S BEEN A BARRIER- FOR ACCESS TO DO WE ARE THAT'S SOMETHING WE LEARNED IN WORKING WITH OUR COMMUNITY SAID TO HELP WITH THIS WE HAVE MULTIPLE FRIENDS AT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TRAINING AND GUIDANCE WITH COMMUNITIES THAT WERE WORKING THROUGH EACH AND EVERY DAY. AND THE FACT THIS WEEK OR LAUNCHING A SERIES OF WEBINARS FOR ALERTING AUTHORITIES AND HAVE ABOUT TWENTY FOUR COUNTIES AND ROLLED SO FAR BUT WE WANT TO CONTINUE WITH THESE. DURING THESE WET WEBINARS THE THAT THE- ALERTING AUTHORITIES WILL PARTICIPATE AND ACTUALLY WALK THROUGH THE TECHNICAL COMPONENTS OF IPODS AND WE HAVE BUT ALSO COME OUT OF IT. WITH A COMPLETED OR AUGMENTED- ALERTED WARNING IMPLEMENTATION PLANS SO THAT WE CAN AGAIN APPROACH AND-STANDARDIZATION. AND ENSURE THAT THAT THAT. THAT THE ROBUST AT PLANS THAT ARE NEEDED AREN'T THE PLACE FOR THIS IMPORTANT CAPABILITY. AND THEN AFTER THIS TRAINING WE'RE GONNA BE FORM YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO HELP US FORMA COLBERT ALERTING AUTHORITIES THAT ARE CONSTANTLY CAN WORK TOGETHER IN THE FUTURE AND SHARE BEST PRACTICES. THEY'RE ALSO TOOLS FOR CALIFORNIANS AND INDIVIDUALS THAT NEED TO BE TO BE AWARE OF AND TAKE PART IN THEIR COMMUNITIES ALERT MORNING SYSTEM FIRST AS ALREADY MENTIONED. THAT INDIVIDUAL SHOULD SIGN UP FOR THEIR LOCAL ALERTING PROGRAM THEY CAN DO SO BY. GOING TO THEIR COUNTY WEBSITE OR OR THEIR LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHERE THEY LIVE. THEY CAN ALSO VISIT CALARTS DOT ORG THAT'S A SITE AT THE STATE START UP THAT HAS ALL KINDS OF INFORMATION ALERT MORNING GUIDELINES THE THINGS THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT TODAY BUT ALSO LEADS TO ALL THE DIFFERENT COUNTIES AND THEIR- OTHER PROGRAMS. IN INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES CAN ALSO TAKE BASIC EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS STEPS TO TALK ABOUT THIS ALL THE TIME. HAVE A PLAN BUT ALSO HAVE. SOMETHING LIKE A BATTERY POWERED AT EIGHT AM RADIO ON BECAUSE THAT IS STILL A REDUNDANT WAY TO GET EMERGENCY INFORMATION OUT TO THE PUBLIC. WHEN OTHER DISTRACTIONS OCCUR. TURNING BRIEFLY TO THE SUBJECT OF EVACUATION WHICH IS AB ALSO- AND- INTEREST TO THIS HEARING TODAY. HELLO- YES WORKS WITH OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS EACH AND EVERY DAY AS PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT MUTUAL AID. SYSTEM A MAJOR ADVANCEMENT TRIED TO ALERT MORNING IS STANDARDIZED TERMINOLOGY FOR EVACUATION. IN THE PAST DIFFERENT TERMINOLOGY WAS USED DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU WORK DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES- SAID DIFFERENT THINGS IN TERMS OF HOW THEY DIRECTED EVACUATION. ZONE HE TO THE MOMENT THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE IT BE DIFFICULT NOT TO ALWAYS KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TERMS. MANDATORY EVACUATION VERSUS VOLUNTARY EVACUATION EVACUATION ORDER OF EVACUATION ADVISORY SHELTER IN PLACE SO THAT WAS DIFFERENT DIFFERENT TERMINOLOGY USED ACROSS THE STATE. SO IN MARCH OF TWENTY NINETEEN THE SAME TIME WE PUBLISH THE OTHER MORNING GUIDELINES HELLO YES CONVENE WILL BE CALLED THE EVACUATION. TERMINOLOGY WORKING GROUP. I REPRESENTED FROM A THE LAW COURSE SERVICES FROM EVER REGION AND STATE WITH A CALL OF STANDARDIZATION SETTLING ON ONE WAY TO DO THIS ACROSS THE STATE THE GROUP UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDED THE FOLLOWING. FOR USE THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO NOW THE- THE ONLY TERMINOLOGY THAT- THAT IS USED AS EVACUATION ORDER EVACUATION WARNING. AND SHELTER IN PLACE SO THIS IS A HUGE STEP- IT'S BEEN ADOPTED NOW IT'S IN USE- IT'S CLEAR IT'S CONSISTENT AND THE MEDIA IS YOU KNOW IMPORTANT RELAY OF EMERGENCY INFORMATION- CAN REFER TO THE SAME TERMS. AND WE REALLY JUST APPLIED OUR FIRE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS I KNOW THAT. SOME OF THEM ARE PANELISTS HERE TODAY I FOR THEIR OUTSTANDING COLLABORATION ON THIS ISSUE RECOGNIZING THIS NEED IT BECAUSE I'M PRESIDENT STEP. TO IMPROVE SAFETY IN CALIFORNIA. SO WE'VE MADE A LOT OF. THERE IS A LOT OF WORK TO DO AS ALREADY HAS BEEN MENTIONED IN THE OPENING COMMENTS EVENTS IN THE STATE CONTINUE TO SHOW THIS. FOR OUR PART HELLO YES IS COMMITTED TO KEEP ISSUE AT THE FOREFRONT THE SAM'S GROUP THAT I MENTIONED ITS WORK DIDN'T STOP WITH PUBLISHING THE GUIDELINES AND TWENTY NINETEEN. RATHER THAT GROUP IS GOING TO STAY IN PLACE TO BE CONTINUOUS TO REVIEW EVENTS TO UPDATE THE GUIDELINES AS WE AS WE LEARN AND- AND MOVE THEIR OFFENSE AND ALSO DEVELOP OTHER POLICIES IN THIS AREA. WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR COUNTIES AND LOCAL JUSTICE- SECTIONS ON TRAINING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND GUIDANCE- THE SYSTEMS HAVE TO BE USED ALL YEAR STEP PRACTICED- TRADE TO IN ORDER FOR THEM TO BE EFFECTIVE WHEN THE TIME IS NEEDED. OUR RELATIONSHIP IS CONTINUING TO BE CONTINUOUS BECAUSE WE HAVE A DEDICATED ALERT WARNING COORDINATOR AND BETTER HELLO YES WHOSE JOB IS TO DO THIS AND WORK WITH OUR LOCAL PARTNERS. EACH AND EVERY DAY MAKE SURE THAT TESTING OCCURS OF THE SYSTEM AND MAKE SURE THAT MAINTENANCE OF THE IPOD CAPABILITY THIS IS STAYING. AT FOR THIS CRITICAL SET OF SYSTEMS TO WORK ACTION IS REQUIRED ON EVERYBODY'S PART ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT MEDICATION PROVIDERS AND THE PUBLIC AS WELL. BUT I TELL EVERYONE CAN RECEIVE TIMELY AND ACCURATE WARNINGS EVERY TIME OUR WORK WILL. AND SOME OF THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE IN THE PAST COUPLE YEARS I WILL CONCLUDE THERE AND HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AT THE COMPLETION OF THE PANEL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS CURRY AND YOUR TEAM AT CALLOW YES FOR THIS INFORMATIVE UPDATE- NEXT- WE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM CHIEF CRAIG TOLD ME. OUR CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION CALIFORNIA. GOOD MORNING SURE CAN YOU HEAR ME ALRIGHT YES WE CAN HEAR YOU. OKAY LET ME BEGIN GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR RIVAS VICE CHAIRMAN WIRE AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS CRAIG TOLD ME NINETEENTH DEPUTY DIRECTOR CAL FIRE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY ON THE TOPIC OF EMERGENCY ALERTS AND EVACUATIONS WERE EXCITED TO BE HERE WITH HELLO YES AS WELL AS OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT COOPERATORS. WALL COUNSELOR DOES NOT SEND UT EMERGENCY ALERTS ARE IN FIRST INFORCE EVACUATION ORDERS THE DEPARTMENT PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE VITAL FUNCTIONS PROVIDE BY PROVIDING CRITICAL INFORMATION AND INTELLIGENCE THE LEARNING AUTHORITIES THAT HELPS KEEP PEOPLE OUT OF HARM'S WAY DURING THE LONG PRIOR. TODAY I WILL BRIEFLY DISCUSS HOW CALPERS SUPPORTS ALERT. AND WARNINGS BEFORE DURING AND AFTER A WILDFIRE. WELL BEFORE THE START OF A WILDFIRE CAL FIRE MONITORS ANALYZES AND PREDICTS FIRE WEATHER INSPIRED ANGEL ACROSS THE STATE AS PART OF AN INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM. HOW DID OUR NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA YOUR GRAPHIC AREA COORDINATING CENTERS OTHERWISE KNOWN AS GAPS. WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH METEOROLOGIST FROM THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE AS WELL AS OTHER FEDERAL AGENCY PARTNERS. THE TEAMS THAT ARE GAC'S GATHER INTERPRET INTELLIGENCE ON FIRE AND WEATHER THREATS USING MAPPING AND SATELLITE IMAGERY PRIMATOLOGY PREPAREDNESS LEVELS RESOURCE AVAILABILITY. YOUR MODELS AND FIRE POTENTIAL INFORMATION TO PREDICT WHERE FIRE DANGER IS HIGHEST AND WERE EXPECTED CONDITIONS COULD IMPACTOUR AVAILABLE FIREFIGHTING RESOURCES. CAL FIRE UTILIZES INTELLIGENCE ON WHETHER ENTIRE THREAT CONDITIONS TO CREATE PRODUCTS FOR DECISION MAKERS. IN THE FIRE SERVICE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THROUGH OUR PREDICTIVE SERVICES PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM THANK OF AN INNER. FIRE SERVE IN TELE CLEARINGHOUSE ENSURING THAT STANDARDIZED PRODUCTS AND PREDICTED FIRE WEATHER AND TRANSFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE WHICH ALLOWED THEM TO BE MORE PROACTIVE IN ANTICIPATING SIGNIFICANT SIGNIFICANT FIRE ACTIVITY. AND DETERMINING LOCAL FIREFIGHTING RESOURCE NEEDS IN ADVANCE OF AN INCIDENT. ONE OF THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY IS A PREDICTIVE SERVICES IS TO PROVIDE SOUND GUIDANCE DEPARTMENT FIRE MANAGEMENT DECISION MAKERS. CONCERNING CURRENT AND PROJECTED SIGNIFICANT FIRE POTENTIAL. ALTHOUGH WEATHER IS A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO CONTRIBUTOR TO SIGNIFICANT FIRE POTENTIAL THIS PRODUCT IS NOT A WEATHER FORECAST BUT RATHER A THREAT INDICATOR FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF LARGE WILDFIRES BASED ON FUEL CONDITIONS AND WEATHER COMBINED. IT DOESN'T THE DAILY PROBABILITY FOR THE OCCURRENCE OF A NEW LARGE FIRE FOR THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT GROWTH ON EXISTING FIRES. ARE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GEOGRAPHIC AREA COORDINATION CENTERS COMPILED SIGNIFICANT FIRE POTENTIAL ANOTHER FIRE INTELLIGENCE T IN NUMEROUS PRODUCTS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO. THE TWO DAY OUTLOOK OF FIRE POTENTIAL ISSUED IN BOTH NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THE SEVEN DAY SIGNIFICANT FIRE POTENTIAL OUTLOOK ISSUED IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE SANTA ANA WILDFIRE THREAT INDEX ISSUED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS DAILY AND MONTHLY BRIEFINGS DISCUSSING THE CURRENT FIELD. CONDITIONS ACROSS THE STATE. BUT IT CERTAINLY AVAILABLE ON THE- CENTERS WEB. FULLER AND WARNING. AS WELL AS FOR THE G. PUBLIC. LISTEN LOW GOVERNMENT MAY FROM PUSH OUT PUBLICLY MESSAGE. THROUGH THEIR ALERT SYSTEM TO NOTIFY COMMUNITIES OF THE POTENTIAL FOR A WHILE PER INCIDENT AND THE NEED TO TAKE PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES SUCH AS GETTING READY TO EVACUATE OR LIMITING CERTAIN ACTIVITIES THAT COULD CAUSE A FIRE. CAL FIRE ALSO USES ITS OWN PUBLIC EDUCATION COMMUNICATION CHANNELS TO AMPLIFY. FIRE WEATHER WARNING MESSAGES ISSUED BY THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE INCLUDING FIRE WEATHER WATCHES AND RED FLAG WARNINGS. THE BASIC DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO TYPES THE WEATHER SERVICE ALERTS IS THAT WHILE A FIRE WEATHER WATCH. INDICATES UPCOMING WEATHER CONDITIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN EXTENSIVE WILDLAND FIRE OR EXTREME FIRE BEHAVIOR. WHEREAS A RED FLAG WARNING INDICATES AN ONGOING OR IMMINENT CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER PATTERN. FOR FIRE CONDITIONS ARE ETHER ONGOING OR EXPECTED TO OCCUR SHORTLY THAT WOULD BE OF A EXTREME NATURE. WHAT'S THE FIRE HAS BEGUN OR AFTER WILDFIRE STARTS THE BUYERS INCIDENT COMMANDER WILL ADVISE LOCAL OFFICIALS IF ANY. NEARBY AREAS NEED TO BE EVACUATED BASED ON THE FIRES LOCATION BEHAVIOR. AND WEATHER FORECASTING. YEAH FIRE HAS SEVERAL CUTTING EDGE TOOLS TO PROVIDE REAL TIME FIRE AND WEATHER INFORMATION TO OUR INCIDENT COMMANDERS TO HELP THEM ADVISED LOCAL OFFICIALS ON THE NEED FOR ANY BACK THE WAY HE- INCLUDING WE HAVE NINETY TWO REMOTE UTOMATED WEATHER STATIONS ARE WATCHES. ON STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREAS AROUND THE STATE THAT. PROVIDE CRITICAL INFORMATION ON CLIMATOLOGY. BASED ON THE LOCAL PHOTOGRAPHY THAT THEY ARE IN THERE ARE OVER ONE HUNDRED FIRE ABOUT ASIAN CAMERAS HOSTED BY THE ALERT BOB FOR NETWORK THAT COULD BE USED TO VISUALLY CONFIRM ACQUIRES LOCATION. AND BEHAVIOR IN MANY FIRE HAZARD AREAS ACROSS THE STATE. WE ALSO HAVE ONDEMAND WILDFIRE SPREAD PREDICTION IN A WILDFIRE WITH FORECASTING SOFTWARE THAT PROVIDES INSTANT COMMANDERS WITH WOMEN. FIRE BEHAVIOR MODELING AND PREDICTED FIRE BEHAVIOR DATA INCLUDING POTENTIAL IMPACTS NEARBY BUILDINGS POPULATIONS. AND CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. USING VOEPEL THE GROUND ON. AND SURVEY. THE ANSWER COMMANDER WILL WRECK. WHICH AREAS SHOULD BACK TO LOOK ON ON AN ONGOING BASIS DURING AND- BUT THE DECISION IS AN ENFORCE THE- ORDERS REST WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IN. SIMILARLY THE DECISION MARK ALERTS THE PUB ALSO RESTS WITH THAT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENTITY OR LOCAL EMERGENCY MANAGERS. THE INCIDENT COMMANDER WILL ALSO ADVISE LOCAL OFFICIALS ONCE INSTEAD PROGRESSES TO A POINT WHERE YOU ACCURATE AREAS CAN BE REPOPULATED. BUT THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENTITY DETERMINES WHEN RESIDENTS CAN RETURN TO THEIR HOMES AND ONE EVACUATION ORDERS CAN BE LIFTED. KALPI RECOGNIZES THE CRITICAL NEED TO BE IN CLOSE COMMUNICATION WITH LOCAL OFFICIALS EMERGENCY MANAGERS. AND THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENTITY FOR THIS PROCESS TO WORK EFFECTIVELY. DURING LARGE INCIDENTS WILL OFTEN INNER AND UNIFIED COMMAND WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT LEADERS. AND LOCAL OKAY AND THEN IT'S A COMMAND POST SO YOU GRADUATION RECOMMENDATIONS CAN RELATE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. DOUBTFIRE ALSO EMBEDS ONE FOUR SPENT REPRESENTATIVES WITHIN EACH OF OUR INCIDENT MANAGEMENT TEAMS IN ORDER TO FACILITATE. RAPID INFORMATION SHARING. WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS. IF NEEDED FIRE. WILL ALSO ASSUME LOCAL FOR. THE HELP BACK TO. INDIVIDUAL FROM A GIVEN AREA IT CAN. WARRANT AFTER WILDFIRE. HAS BURNED ESPECIALLY THE MORE SIGNIFICANT WILDFIRES AS WE'VE EXPERIENCED IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS CABALLERO COOPERATION WITH OTHER CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY DEPARTMENTS MAY DEPLOY A WATERSHED EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM OR WORK TO ASSESS POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO SPECIFIC VALUES AT RISK FROM ANTICIPATED WATERSHED RESPONSES. TO BURN IMPACT. PART NINE ALL CORD WITH BURKE AREA NUMBER RESPONSE OF TEAM. TO ASSESS THE OF FIRE ON THE MAY BY AND WATERSHED. LARGE WILDFIRES DRAMATICALLY ALTER SOIL AND TRAIN INCREASE THE DANGEROUS FIVE AND MUD FLOW CONDITIONS ONE SIGNIFICANT RAIN WATER RETURNS TO THE LANDSCAPE. ACCORDING AFTER HE FIRED OFTEN MORE SEVERE WHAT OTHER OCCUR BECAUSE TO BRING IN. FIRE IN COMBINE ONCE SAID ABOUT THE WATER STORY ACROSS THE CHART INTO NEEDED RIGHT. SPECIAL WORK IN TEAMS DETERMINE THE NEED FROM BY AND PICK THEM MINIMUM THE TO AND PROPERTY AND WORK WITH LOCAL AND OF. AND CA OPPOSED FLOOD RISK IN THEIR GIVE LOCAL INFORMATION THEY NEED TO. EMERGENCY ALERTS AND DOESN'T YOU LIKE ARE SHOULD EXACTLY SIGNIFICANT WAY. ON BURNS. IS INCLUDED LIKE TO REMIND YOU THAT CAL FIRE IS READY WILD APP IS A GREAT SOURCE FOR ONE FROM ON ME OF THE TOPICS ADVENTURE TODAY. WHILE OUR APP SHOULD NOT BE USED AS AN EMERGENCY ALERT TO ALL THE PROVIDES THE PUBLIC WITH STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO PREPARE THEIR HOMES AND FAMILIES BEFORE DURING. AND AFTER WILDFIRE STRIKES AND PROVIDES A SHORT SITUATIONAL AWARENESS RENDON REVEALS EXAMINES ABOUT WILDFIRE ACTIVITY BOTH IN THEIR LOCAL AREAS. OF ALL TRAVELING THROUGH THE STATE. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR EVERY PERSON MAY BE IN. BY A WILD CAL. IF YOU READY FOR AN INCIDENT TOOK HER. THIS IN. PRE IMAGE THE FOR SPACE AND HARD THEIR HOME AGAINST FINANCE. GETTING FOR OPINION. EVACUATION BY PER IN ADVANCE AND UP TO RECEIVE EMERGENCY ALERTS YOUR THEIR AGENCIES AND OF COURSE BEING READY TO GO THEY HAVE THE BEST CHANCES RABINAL WILDFIRE BY BEING READY TO GO AND EVACUATING EARLY AND WHEN LOCAL OFFICIALS ADVICE THANK YOU FR YOUR TIME AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU CHIEF TOLD ME N. CAL FIRE FOR EVERYTHING THAT YOU DO TO KEEP US SAFE- ESPECIALLY DURING THIS FIRE SEASON- BEFORE I TURN IT OVER TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR QUESTIONS I WOULD LIKE TO THANK. UP SENATOR PAN ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY FOR JOINING US TODAY IN PERSON AT THIS HEARING THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. AND NEXT. DOES ANY ANY MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE QUESTIONS OKAY I'LL START WITH SENATOR PAN. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I WANT TO THANK OUR TWO PRESENTERS- I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR- DIPPY DIRECTOR CURRY FOR- IN. SO FIRST OF ALL UP ONE OF THE WAYS PEOPLE DO GET INFORMATION THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA AND IN FACT- ONE EXAMPLE WASN'T A WILDFIRE BUT WHEN THE OROVILLE DAM WAS BEING CHALLENGED. ARE ACTUALLY- WE SAW ON SOCIAL MEDIA THE EVACUATION ORDERS FROM- THAT THE COUNTY SHERIFF AND SO FORTH AND BEING DOWNSTREAM FROM THE DAM WONDERED WHAT THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO MEAN. ARE THERE GUIDELINES THAT- YES IS PUTTING OUT OR AGAIN I KNOW THAT A LOT OF THIS IS BEING ALSO DONE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BUT IN TERMS OF. HOW SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS ARE USED OR SHOULD BE APPROPRIATELY USED OR NOT USED TO SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT DISASTERS BECAUSE- I THINK AS YOU. TALKED ABOUT EARLIER YOU KNOW WHEN THE CONCERNS ABOUT SOME OF THE- CELL PHONE NOTIFICATIONS OF THE TYPES OF THINGS IS YOU KNOW THE NOTICE IS GETTING INTO OTHER AREAS AND CAUSING CONFUSION- BUT THAT WAS ALSO SITUATION SOCIAL MEDIA. AND PERHAPS HAVING AND I'M SAYING DON'T USE SOCIAL MEDIA AT ALL BUT SOME GUIDELINES FOR HOW SOCIAL MEDIA USE APPROPRIATELY BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF PEOPLE SEE THESE POSTS AND DIFFERENT WAYS AND THEY'LL BE SHARED AND SO FORTH. AND THEN NOT THEN ALL THESE PHONE CALLS ARE HAPPENING TO DIFFERENT OFFICES SO HE HAS TO DISCUSSION ABOUT. WHETHER THERE'S THOUGHTS ABOUT GUY FOR. USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA BY APPROPRIATE AUTHORITIES LOCAL AND STATE TO. GIVE INFORMATION OUT ABOUT- EITHER DISASTERS ARE IMPENDING DISASTERS. CENTER THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- ABSOLUTELY I MENTIONED THE OTHER MORNING GUIDELINES I DIDN'T TALK TOO MUCH ABOUT WHAT'S IN THEM BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S RECOGNIZED IN THOSE IS IT THAT OUR OUR MULTI NODE OF WAYS TO GET INFORMATION OUT SOCIAL MEDIA ABSOLUTELY IS AB ONE OF THE PROMINENT WAYS WE USE IT- TO RELATE I'M EVEN EMERGENCY INFORMATION AS DO MOST COMMUNITIES AND THAT'S HOW MOST PEOPLE YOU KNOW MANY PEOPLE. ARE LOOKING OUT IN DENVER AND RELY ON AS A SOURCE SO THE GUIDELINES TO ADDRESS AND NOT JUST THE IPODS IN THE WE- BUT LOCAL OTHER MORNING PROGRAMS AND YOU KNOW JUST RECOGNIZING THAT THESE EXIST AND- YOU KNOW WAYS THAT WE CAN STANDARDIZE THOSE SAID THAT AGAIN WERE CLEAR AND CONSISTENT ACROSS THE PUBLIC. TO THE EXTENT WE NEED TO DO MORE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT ARE YOU KNOW ONGOING WORK IS- TO VALUE WAIT HOW THAT WENT IF WE HAVE TO BEEF UP THE- SOCIAL MEDIA- KIND OF REFERENCE OR CREATE SOMETHING EVEN AS AN ADDENDUM WILL ABSOLUTELY DO THAT BUT WE'LL WE'LL TAKE A LOOK. AT THAT AND I'LL VERIFY THAT TIME THAT WE'VE GOT TO THAT TYPE OF- GUIDANCE CAPTURED AND CERTAINLY AS WE WORKABLE GOVERNMENT GOING FORWARD WE WILL BE EVALUATING THAT BUT I APPRECIATE YOU MAKING THAT COMMENT AND- A GREAT. THAT THAT'S ANOTHER AREA WHERE STANDARDIZATION AND CONSISTENCY IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE THAT IS GOING TO BE A REALLY PROMINENT WAY- THAT THAT EMERGING INFORMATION WILL BE DISTRIBUTED. WELL THANK YOU- IT WOULD MAKE NO TO CHALLENGE SOCIAL MEDIA IT'S HARD TO LIMIT WHERE THE MESSAGE GOES SO THE CLARITY THAT MESSAGE BECOMES CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR EXAMPLE EXACTLY WHICH AREAS ARE AFFECTED ALL RIGHT- SO IT COULD BE COMING FROM THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE. AND THEY'RE JUST THINKING IT'S GOING TO PEOPLE IN THE COUNTY BUT PEOPLE AFFORDING THINGS AND PEOPLE ARE ON THE BORDER TO GO WHAT WAS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN FOR ME AS I MENTIONED WHEN THE OROVILLE DAM THEY HAD- ISSUE WITH THE- THE NOW THE TAMPA TENCHI OVERTOPPING OR DIRECT- THOSE OF US ARE DOWNSTREAM WENT WHAT WAS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN USERS TRYING TO EVACUATE RIGHT AND IRONICALLY THE FIRST I HEARD. ABOUT IT WAS ON A LIST TO SEE A ALERT ON SOCIAL MEDIA WAS NOT THROUGH SOME OF SOURCE. SO I THINK THAT- YOU KNOW SOME CAREFUL EXAM. ABOUT OUR BEST PRACTICES IT COMES TO SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS THAT WHEN PEOPLE SEE INFORMATION AND THEY'RE NOT IN THE AREA WHAT HOW DO THEY KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE AFFECTED- YOU KNOW SO BECAUSE YOU HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE SEEING IT. WHO- WHO WILL BE INTERPRETING IN DIFFERENT WAYS DEPENDING ON YOU KNOW WHERE THEY ARE AND SO FORTH SO I THINK THAT'S GONNA BE VERY IMPORTANT. THEN I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION I ANSWER HAD IS THAT I KNOW THAT THE ABOUT. AND NEED FOR BACK UP POWER AND SO FORTH AND NINE AND I UNDERSTAND CERTAINLY. IN THIS HEARING AND THAT THE MORE IMMEDIATE CONCERNS WILDFIRES BUT I REPRESENT SACRAMENTO OUR BIGGEST ISSUES TRYING TO BE FLOOD. NOT SAY WE DON'T POTENTIALLY A WILDFIRE. WE'RE MORE THINK ABOUT THESE BACK UP SYSTEMS. ARE WE ALSO PAYING STANDARDS BE SURE THEY'RE WALKING SINCE A FLOOD PROOF IS PROBABLY OVER BUT THE FLOOD RESISTANT RIGHT SO YOU NOTHING GENERATORS ON THE GROUND. WHERE WHEN THE WATER STARTS RISING BASICALLY THE GENERATORS GO OUT AND CELL TOWERS ARE STILL OUT SO. CAN YOU AYE MAYBE TOUCH ON THAT. WELL OUR APPROACH IS ALL HAZARDS WILDFIRES IS- I THINK THAT IS. OCCURRING MORE COMMONLY THESE DAYS IN CALIFORNIA BUT BUT WE NEVER THE DESTRUCTION. AND HER. FROM A VARIETY OF MEANS YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S EIGHT YOU KNOW TRAFFIC ACCIDENT THAT TAKES OUT POWER OR A FLOOD DISASTER AN EARTHQUAKE OR HAVE SO WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING AT A COMPREHENSIVE WAY. TO ENSURE THERE'S REDUNDANCY I DON'T HAVE THAT TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE OF EXACTLY THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CELL TOWERS AND WHAT WORKS BEST FOR DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS AND IN CALIFORNIA BUT- I DO KNOW THAT. REDUNDANCY IN REGARD TO COMMUNICATION SO IT ARE VERY UPSET PLANNING EFFORTS AND EXERCISES FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF DISASTER WE TALK THROUGH- WHAT IT IS WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO. AND HOW THE STATE CAN WORK WITH OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WOULD BE THE REDUNDANCIES WHETHER IT'S A REDUNDANCY FOR. TRANSPORTATION A REDUNDANCY FOR COMMUNICATIONS SO- SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO ALWAYS ENSURE. ARE WARNING CENTER ITSELF HAS MULTIPLE REDUNDANT PATHWAYS- WE HAVE AND HE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN INCLUDING A MARKER WITH A SYSTEM. AND THAT CONNECTS THE STATE FROM END TO END FOR INFORMATION AND RELAY- BY SATELLITE. INFORMATION SYSTEM THAT'S IN PLACE IN EVERY SINGLE COUNTY IN ADDITION TO MOBILE COMMUNICATION- SO ALL OF THAT'S THERE OF COURSE AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ALERT MORNING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. MESSAGING THAT CANNOT WAIT UNTIL WE DISCOVER THAT IT HAD OUTAGES OCCURRED AND THEN SO OF COURSE SOME OF THESE ARE MORE LONG TERM SOLUTIONS THAT- THAT AT ABSOLUTELY. AB RIGHT REDUNDANCY IS AN ABSOLUTE PRINCIPLE IN OUR BUSINESS AND ANYONE WHO'S IN PUBLIC SAFETY EMERGENCY SERVICES AND CERTAINLY- IT'S SOMETHING WE'LL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT TO MAKE SURE THAT ON THIS TOPIC. THE THE RELIABILITY OF THE SYSTEMS THAT SUPPORT THIS IMPORTANT MESSAGING THAT HAS TO GO OUT TO THE PUBLIC. IS RIGHT AS AS ROBUST AS IT NEEDS TO BE SO- SO I KIND OF A- LONG ANSWER TO SAY THAT WE LOOK AT ALL HAVE- AND IN ADDITION TO. THAT YOU NEED MORE COMMON HAZARDS THAT FIXED. RECENTLY RESHAPE THAT- IT'S HEARD STORY- NOT HERE AND TELL BUT IN OTHER STATES WHERE EXAMPLE IF HALF IN THE BUT ONLY FLOOR THEN THEY WONDERED WHY DIDN'T HAVE POWER. RIGHT- BECAUSE THEY'RE UNDER WATER THEN WORK VERY WELL UNDER WATER SO- AND CERTAINLY I KNOW THAT- WE'VE INVESTED AS A STATE HAVING BEEN ON BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE AND VARIOUS COMPONENTS COMMUNICATION BUT THEN AGAIN THINK ABOUT THE RESIDENCY TO THE PUBLIC I THINK SPREAD THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE. RIGHT BECAUSE YOU DON'T CONTROL WHAT NOW WHEN WE HAVEN'T FOUND ONLY A CELLPHONE OR HOW WE'RE GETTING OUR INFORMATION AND YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S RADIO PHONE OR OTHER TYPES OF SOURCES AND INCLUDING SOCIAL MEDIA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR ANSWERS. THANK YOU I SENATE JACK'S. HAS A QUESTION. THANK YOU SO MUCH I APPRECIATE IT AND THANK YOU FOR THOSE VERY KIND WORDS YOU KNOW THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT COMMITTEE- THE PRINCIPAL OR AT LEAST THE INITIAL IMPACT CRASH PRIMARY ROLE OF GOVERNMENT IS THE PROTECTION AND THE SAFETY OF ITS PEOPLE. AND CLEARLY- WITH THE WILDFIRES AND THEN OF COURSE THE DEBRIS FLOW WE SUFFERED IN MY DISTRICT AND THEN WE TALK ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR DAM- PREACHING AND WHAT HAVE YOU AND THE POTENTIAL FOR EARTHQUAKES ALL THESE THINGS ARE REAL IN CALIFORNIA AND I APPRECIATE WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR. FOR BRINGING THIS HEARING FORWARD TODAY- BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT A LOT OF THE DEATHS AND THE DESTRUCTION THAT TOOK PLACE WAS AS A RESULT OF INADEQUATE- WARNINGS OR A DECISION MAKING WITH RESPECT TO WHAT WERE THE BEST APPROACH IS THAT PEOPLE SHOULD TAKE- TO PROTECT THEMSELVES- DURING THESE INCIDENTS- SENATOR MCGUIRE HAS DONE SOME VERY IMPORTANT LEGISLATION ON WARNING SYSTEMS. I ALSO- I DRAFTED AND WAS A FORTUNE ENOUGH TO GET PAST OF LEGISLATION TO EXPAND- COUNTY LISTS WHEN- WHEN IT COMES TO NOTIFICATIONS WE FIND THAT WHEN IT'S AN OPT IN SYSTEM WE REALLY HAVEN'T GOTTEN A WHOLE LOT OF- RESPONSE AND SO LEGISLATION IDEA CALLS FOR OPT OUT SYSTEM SO THAT- PEOPLE WILK- WHERE THEY COUNTIES WILL PROACTIVELY PUT PEOPLE ON THESE WARNING SYSTEMS SO THAT. AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME- PEOPLE WILL BE WARNED OF THE DANGERS AHEAD AND SO I THINK- SB A TWENTY ONE AND THEN S. B. A SEVEN NINETY FOUR WERE TWO BILLS THAT I THAT I BROUGHT TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM THEY WORK- ULTIMATELY. I SHOULD SAY AT EIGHT TWENTY ONE DID PAST SEVEN NINETY FOR WAS ALL IN COURT. INTO A AB TWENTY TWO THIRTEEN THE- BOTH RELYING ON PROACTIVE EFFORTS ON THE PART OF OUR COUNTIES AND OUR TELECOM PROVIDERS TO SHARE CONTACT INFORMATION SO PEOPLE CAN BE WARRANT APPROPRIATELY- AND- YOU KNOW NOT JUST AS THE AUTHOR THAT LEGISLATION BUT SOMEONE WHO'S HAD THE PERSONALLY EVACUATE NUMEROUS TIMES- I KNOW THAT- MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE WHO ARE HERE TODAY HAVE SHARED THAT. DISTINCTION AND- IT'S HORRIFYING AND IT'S VERY INTIMIDATING AND- IT'S SCARY IS PROBABLY JUST A GOOD WORD NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO WHERE TO GO WIDE WHAT WAS GOING ON IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THE SYSTEMS IN PLACE- AND I AM VERY INTERESTED TO KNOW THE STATUS. OF ALL OF OUR COUNTIES EFFORTS TO EXPAND THEIR UNIVERSE OF CONTACTS- IT WAS NOTED TO- THAT TWENTY EIGHT COUNTIES HAVE. PARTICIPATED IN ONE OF THESE PROGRAMS WHAT WE HAVE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES WERE THE OTHER THIRTY COUNTY- IS CHALO YES AWARE ALL OF OUR- THE SEVERAL COUNTIES THEIR STATUS WITH REGARD TO EXPANDING OTHER CONTACT THIS HI I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW THAT IT SHOULD- CAL- YES HAVE A ROLE. IN MONITORINGTHIS PROCESS SO THAT- POLICYMAKERS HAVE A CENTRAL SOURCE FOR ASSESSING THE STATE OF THE ART COUNTIES EFFORTS. BUT AND ALSO THE PUBLIC YOU KNOW IN IN TODAY YOU KNOW THOSE ARE TO ME AND DOING THEIR PART TO SIGN UP IS AN IMPORTANT THING THAT ALL OF US I THINK IT'S ACT COULD BENEFIT. FROM PROMOTING AND ENSURING THAT THAT PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF THOSE TOOLS BUT IT'S JUST GOT TO BE ALL THOSE THINGS WORKING TOGETHER IT'S NEVER GOING TO BE ONE THING AND THAT WORKS FOR ALL IT'S GOT TO BE ALL OF IT WORKING AND IN CONCERT SO JUST YOUR HELP- WITH THE LEGISLATIVE TOOLS YOU'VE ALREADY GIVEN. THE REALLY TO PROMOTE- BABY THE RESOURCES THAT WERE TRYING TO MAKE AVAILABLE AND MAKE IT EASY TO ACCESS TO NAVIGATE THESE SYSTEMS AGAIN- IF YOU DON'T USE SOMETHING ALL THE TIME. IT IS NOT THE TIME IN THE HEAT OF THE BATTLE TO BE DOING IT FOR THE FIRST TIME SO THAT TRAINING EXERCISE PRACTICE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ALL OF THAT ON THE FRONT END IS WHAT WE SEE OUR ROLE TO DO AND WE'RE PREPARED TO DO CONTINUE TO DO. OKAY THANK YOU I HAVE ONE LAST QUESTION WHEN YOU MENTION AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR CREATING A SINGULAR SYSTEM A WARNING SAYS- CAN TO COUNTIES THAT I REPRESENT WITH DIRECTLY WITH THE THOMAS FIRE. EACH COUNTY HAD A DIFFERENT- DESIGNATION SO THE PUBLIC VERY CONFUSED AS TO WHAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO DO BUT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS TOO PARTICULARLY WHEN IT CAME TO THE DEBRIS FLOW IS THAT THE MAPS THAT THEY WERE USING. WERE OLDER MAPS AND THEY WERE INACCURATE AND WE LOST TWENTY THREE PEOPLE- IN PART BECAUSE THE WARNINGS THAT WERE GIVEN WERE BASED UPON INACCURATE IN OLDER MAPS IS ALWAYS YES DOING ANYTHING- TO. MAKE SURE THAT THE INFORMATION THAT WE STAND GOING OUT WITH THE WARNING SYSTEMS AND SO FORTH IS ACCURATE TO ARE YOU DOING ANY MONITORING AT ANY OVERSEEING OF THE VARIOUS KINDS OF EMERGENCY- MAPS AND DATA. THAT IS AVAILABLE TO FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO ASSURE THAT THEY ARE GETTING THE RIGHT INFORMATION AND TRANSMITTING. THAT PROPERLY TO THE PUBLIC. AND ABSOLUTELY SO ON. FOR SAID DIFFERENT. SORT OF PERCENT I'M SO AS DIFFERENT DIFFERENT TYPES OF. THAT WE INVOLVED FIRST ON. OF COURSE WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THERE'S A GOOD DOES GOING TO KIRK ON A GIVEN YEAR TO THE FOLKS FIVE. WATERSHED US. AND MAPPING IS A REAL TIME FOR. THAT IS INJURED. INTO A PART OF OUR RESPONSE STRUCTURE SO IMMEDIATELY KICKS INTO GEAR WE PARTNER WITH CAL FIRE. WITH A GEOLOGIST AND- SASS YOU KNOW WE'RE IN OUR WILD FIRES IN CALIFORNIA TEND ABOUT UP AGAINST- YOU KNOW RAIN SEASON. AND SO THAT THE MEDIA WORK OUT TO BE DONE AND WE'RE DOING THAT THROUGHOUT THE STATE AS WE SPEAK TO MATT. AND HUMANITARIAN AID TO COUNTIES AND COMMUNITIES WHERE THOSE DEBRIS FLOW RISKS EXIST I BASED ON THE WILD CARDS THAT JUST OCCURRED. SO THAT THEY CAN THEN EMPLOY THAT INTO THEIR PRE POSITIONING THEIR A LEARN WARNING. AND SYSTEMS AND- KIND OF EVACUATION PREPARATIONS FOR THE PUBLIC SO THAT'S ONE FACET- FOR THINGS LIKE. TWO NOMINEES YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT THAT'S THE RISK IN CALIFORNIA WE KNOW THAT THESE ARE OUR GEOGRAPHY. YOU KNOW SORT OF A WHAT A WORST CASE WOULD PRESENT WEEDMAPS THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I'VE BEEN DOWN OF THE OF THE COAST. AND THAT'S AN EFFORT THAT WE PARTNER WITH THE WITH THE STATE GEOLOGIC SURVEY ON. AND THAT INFORMATION IMPACT IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WHEN THAT JAPAN EARTHQUAKE AND TSUNAMI OCCURRED. AND A COUPLE OF PLACES- SANTA CRUZ NOTABLY AND END UP ON THE NORTH COAST HAD HAD ISSUES HAD HAD TSUNAMI INUNDATION. THEY ACTUALLY USE THE TSUNAMI INUNDATION MAPS THAT WE HAD CREATED TOGETHER. DO YOU REALLY AREN'T ARC OUT THERE EVACUATION GUIDANCE OF COURSE IN THAT CASE. THERE WAS MANY HOURS OF WARNING A LITTLE MORE TRYING. TO BE REALLY PRECISE ON ON INSTRUCTING THE PUBLIC AND YOU ARE NOT ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE THAT- AND- I'D SAY ANOTHER AREA THAT'S KIND OF RECENT THAT IS HAS AN IMPORTANT MAPPING COMPONENT THE COW IS INVOLVED WITH IT IS FOR DAM SAFETY OF COURSE WE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. TWENTY SEVENTEEN ORVILLE AS A RESULT OF THAT. EVENT- THE WHOLE SWEEP A SET OF CHANGES CAME ABOUT TERMS. AT THE END. REQUIREMENTS OF THE WORLD KALAYAAN PLAYS AND THAT. YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH EVERY SINGLE JURORS. THAT A IT COULD BE IMPACTED A- TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE SOME CALLED. EMERGENCY ACT. PLANS IN PLACE- AND THERE IS A SERIES OF THAT TIME FRAMES. WITH THAT HE AP IS ONE OF THE FUNDING THINGS THAT THEY CLEAR. IS APPLIED- LEARN MARNIE THIS IS GONNA LEVELS WHO ARE THEY GONNA TELL. AND HOW DOES THAT INFORM. GET FIRST RESPONDER IN THE- IT'S SET- IN A BIT. OF PREVENT DAMAGE SENT THOSE HE HE'S ANOTHER. COMPONENT OF. YES THEY DO IN A- MAPS THAT HAS TO BECOME. BY ENGINEER HAS TO BE SO OFF- VI&lt;c.cyan&gt; I READ. FOR SAFETY. AND&lt;/c&gt; THEY HAVE TO BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC SO THAT'S A BIG CHANGE AND IT WAS KIND OF ODD HI. IT CONSISTENT FRAMEWORK FOR US IS GREAT FOR DAM SAFETY BEFORE TWENTY SEVENTEEN IN THE LEGISLATION. AND NOW THAT IS- IS MORE STANDARDIZED ACROSS THE STATE SO THOSE ARE JUST SOME EXAMPLES. OR WORKING ON THE MAPPING. AREA IN MY LAST-QUESTION IF I MAY MADAM CHAIR- IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS THERE ANY POLICY ANY DIRECTIVE ANY LEGISLATION. THAT YOU BELIEVE WOULD MAKE IT. EASIER AND MORE EFFECTIVE FOR YOU TO WORK WITH THE COUNTIES- HAVING PERHAPS IT IS AN EXAMPLE MORE AUTHORITY- THE CONTROL- DIRECTIVE OVER- THE WAY THE COUNTIES THEN. CONDUCT THEIR EMERGENCY- WORK- THAT WOULD THAT YOU THINK WOULD MAKE IT MORE SUCCESSFUL IN PROTECTING THE PUBLIC- AS WE FACE. THESE KINDS OF DISASTERS. THANK YOU FOR THAT I MEAN WE HAVE A GREAT REALLY. WITH OUR COUNTIES THE SENSE. HAS BEEN EMPLOYED FOR- WHAT SEEMS LIKE- FOREVER HERE HELD. AND IT WORKS AND PER IN OUR TOWN AND LOCAL DRASTIC. AT THE PARTICIPATION SYSTEM ENSURES THAT IT WORK IN SUCH AN EXTENT THAT WE CAN. JUST ENCOURAGE THAT THEY WE USE THAT WE ALL KIND OF COME AROUND THESE THESE COMMON FRAMEWORKS THAT ALL INTER TIRED THE EACH OTHER WE JUST TALKED ABOUT FLOOD RISK. A MINUTE AGO- WE CAN'T LOSE SIGHT OF THE FACT THAT WE'RE ALL HAZARDS IN CALIFORNIA. AND SO YOU KNOW I pDON'T I DON'T I YOU KNOW JUST JUST TO BE ABLE TO. TO USUALLY HAVE EFFECTIVELY I THINK CAN GO A LONG WAY AND IT HAS IN THIS SPACE BUT WE'VE GOT WE'VE GOT MORE TO DO WE'VE GOT EVALUATE THESE PAST EVENTS AND FIGURE OUT WHAT'S STILL GOING WRONG AND HOW DO WE- BEST. AND SO- YOU KNOW SO LIKE I SAID WE HAVE. WE HAVE NO- SHORTAGE OF- PARTICIPATION IN COLLABORATION WITH OUR WITH OUR COUNTIES THEY HAVE A HUGE JOB- IT ADDED THEN WE RECOGNIZE THAT AND SO REALLY OUR CHARGES TO MAKE THAT. IS EASY AND RELEVANT AND TO THEM AND- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY WE'VE GOT TO SEE HOW SOME OF THESE TOOLS THAT WE DO HAVE THAT HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED ALL THIS IS ALL VERY NEW. HOW IS THAT WORKING AND THEN OF COURSE JUST LIKE ANYTHING- WE WERE ELECTED TO ADDRESSED IF NEEDED BUT- BUT WE DO APPRECIATE. AND ADDS THAT WORK FOR TOGETHER WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT FIRE SERVICE ON THE TENT ON THE TERMINOLOGY. AND WORK WITH OUR COLLEAGUES IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT THROUGH THE SAM'S COMMITTEE JUST THE FACT THAT EVERYONE CAME TOGETHER RECOGNIZED AS WHAT'S GOOD FOR ONE COMMUNITY SHOULD BE YOU KNOW KIND OF. CONSISTENT ACROSS ALL COMMUNITIES ARE NOT INDIVIDUAL EFFORTS IS HUGE. AND WE WANT TO SEE MORE OF THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR. SAM NEXT WE HAVE BY CHAIR MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH READING CHAIR UP BE VERY QUESTIONS UP FOR THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR DEPUTY DIRECTOR GOOD MORNING THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. JUST TWO ITEMS NUMBER ONE ON THE SEVENTY TWO HOUR RULE FROM THE PC FOR WIRELESS I THINK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO BE ABLE TO HAVE- THE REDUNDANCY IN THE BACKUP FOR THOSE CELL PHONE TOWERS WOULD LIKE TO BE TO GET YOUR TAKE SINCE THE SEVENTY TWO HOUR RULE DIDN'T APPLY TO LAND LINES I THINK THAT'S JUST IT'S CRITICAL. ESPECIALLY IN MORE RURAL AREAS WOULD LIKE TO BE TO GET THE TAKE FROM- YES AND THEN ON A SECOND ISSUE IN REGARDS TO THE ACTUATION ROUTES FOR THE BILL RIGHT MEANT YOU'RE JUST ASKING A QUESTION ABOUT TUITION RATES. THANK YOU SO MUCH MANAGER HI THIS IS WORK THAT AS CENTER JACKSON HAS BEEN A LOT OF TIME ON IN HER SENATE BILL ONE EIGHTY TWO- CAN YOU TALK. ABOUT DEVELOP I THINK THERE'S GROWING CONCERN ESPECIALLY IN HIGH FIRE HAZARD. SEVERITY ARIES. ABOUT NGUYEN IN IF WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO BUILD- IN THOSE AREAS AND IF WE ARE. LOOKING AT YOU KNOW MANDATED VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AROUND DEVELOPMENTS. MANDATING NO LONGER ALLOWING ONE WAY AND ONE WAY OUT BUT HAVING. TO WAIT FOR INGRESS AND EGRESS- AND ALSO A FUNDING MECHANISM FOR THOSE pEDUCATION MANAGEMENT FIREBREAKS GOING BUT WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE YOU COME IN MADAM DEPUTY DIRECTOR IN THE SEVEN TO OUR ROLE. FROM THE P. C. LAN LINES AS WELL AS HAVING THOSE TOUGH CONVERSATIONS WITH NEW DEVELOPMENT- YEAH ABSOLUTELY ON THAT SEVENTY TWO HOUR EXPANDING THAT AND TO ENSURE THAT YOU KNOW LIKE THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS THAT PEOPLE GET INFORMATION IT'S NOT. JUST CELLPHONES ALTHOUGH THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE HAVE CELL PHONES AND- REDUNDANCY ACROSS ALL THOSE LINES. AND WE FOUND THAT YOU KNOW IT IT PS PS. AND FIRES AND OTHER EVENTS- THESE YOU KNOW POCKETS OF AREAS AND DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE THERE'S GOING TO BE A DIFFERENT SORT OF MAJORITY NEEDS A AT COMMUNICATING WHETHER IT'S VOICE INTERNET- CELLPHONE. OR LANDLINE AND THEN ALL OF IT I'M SHOULD BE SHOULD HAVE HAVE SOME ABILITY TO HAVE SOME KIND OF REDUNDANCY OR CARE OF OR SOME OF THAT RESPONSIBILITY IS ON ON THE PUBLIC TO KIND OF DO WHAT THEY CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO INFORMATION BUT CERTAINLY SOME OF IT. IS ON OUR COMMUNICATION PROVIDERS AND OUR REGULATORS WHO THEN- MANDATE WHAT CHANGE NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN ORDER SO- SO I DON'T HAVE THE SPLIT ON EXACTLY- KIND OF LAND LINE VERSUS CELL PHONE USE AND THE DIFFERENCE THAT HAS. THIS HAS MADE IN TERMS OF HAVING ROLES BUT CERTAINLY WE WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF. OF REDUNDANCY ACROSS THE BOARD FOR COMMUNICATION CHANNELS PARTICULARLY FOR THIS IMPORTANT ALERT MORNING IN TERMS OF THE I CAN SPEAK A LITTLE BIT AND JANET CHIEF DEPUTY TOLD ME MIGHT HAVE SOME. INSIGHT AS WELL BUT WE HAVE A FEW THINGS ON IN TERMS OF EVACUATION ROUTES AND RESOURCES THAT MIGHT BE AVAILABLE FOR THAT. FIRST OF ALL ALL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE IN PLACE A LOCAL HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN. THEY HAVE TO HAVE THAT IN ORDER TO ACCESS FEDERAL DOLLARS. AND POST DISASTER WHEN THOSE EVENTS OCCUR WHICH HAS BEEN COMMONPLACE I THINK WE HAVE SOME TWENTY SEVEN COUNTIES UNDER A FEDERAL DECLARATION OF DISASTER RIGHT NOW JUST BE FROM THAT FOUR MILLION ACRES. OF WILDFIRES THAT BURNED THAT'S NOT INCLUDING ALL THE STUFF THAT PRE EXISTED ALL THE FIRES AND THE EARTHQUAKE AND- IT IN A COUPLE SUMMERS AGO. SO EVERYONE OF THOSE BRINGS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR RISK REDUCTION. FUNDS. THERE ARE MANY TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT CAN BE DONE THOSE WERE DOT FINDS FOR AWHILE. INCLUDING THE ENHANCEMENT OF EVACUEE. BEEN MANAGEMENT- AB THAT. THAT ARE FIRE- IF SOMEONE AND SO THAT'S A BIG PART OF IT BUT I THINK THAT AND I MEAN AROUND BUT I THINK THE ONE ITEM I WOULD SAY WITH THAT IS. THE CHALLENGE FOR THOSE FUNDS YOU HAVE TO. BUILD BACK TO WHAT YOU HAD YOU CAN'T ENHANCE. IN THAT'S BEEN THE CHALLENGE FOR MANY COUNTIES AND THIS ASSEMBLY WOMAN AGUIAR-CURRY AND I'VE GONE THROUGH THAT- ESPECIALLY WITH LIKE FOR EXAMPLE THE CDBG DR FUNDS. THAT THERE'S SOME. CHALLENGES IN SOME REQUIREMENTS. I THINK GOING FORWARD. ARE WE GOING TO CONTINUE TO BUILD IN THOSE HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES. IN IF WE ARE- AND MANY OF THESE AREAS HAVE BURNED MULTIPLE TIMES- NEEDING TO LOOK I GUESS YOU'RE TAKE- YES IS TAKE ON- NO LONGER ALLOWING FOR ONE WAY AND ONE WAY OUT THAT'S A- HUGE CHU POINT WHEN IT COMES TO EVACUATIONS. NUMBER TWO LOOKING AT MANDATED FIRE BREAKS IT HAD TO BE MAINTAINED IN PERPETUITY AS WE USED TO SEE- IN THE STATE BUT JUST JUST GETTING TO THOSE SPECIFIC ITEMS AS WE MOVE FORWARD A NEW DEVELOPMENT. AS WE CONTINUE TO BUILD INTO THE WILL WE CONTINUE TO BUILDING THOSE HIGH FIVE OR SIX. HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES. YOUR TAKE ON DO WE NEED TO UPDATE OUR STANDARDS ONCE AGAIN- FOR PROTECTION OF THESE NEW DEVELOPMENTS. WELL I APPRECIATE WE ARE. THAT THE COMMUNITY SAY. AND THE FACE OF WILDFIRE AS ABSOLUTELY ABOUT MOST IMPORTANT. I'M AND I APOLOGIZE IF I WASN'T CLEAR- I WAS TALKING ABOUT FUNDS THAT CAN BE USED TO ENHANCE SPECIFICALLY THEIR CALL HAVE A MEDICATION. THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM THAT KIND OF RETURN TO ADD PRE DISASTER STATE- WHICH IS ANOTHER FEMALE PROGRAM THAT. THAT OUR COMMUNITIES ARE FAMILIAR WITH- SO THOSE PARTICULARLY COULD BE USED FOR THINGS LIKE IMPROVING EVACUATION SAFETY VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. SO YOU KNOW WHILE WE AGREE THOSE ARE IMPORTANT. AND WE HAVE PUT TO GET PUT FORTH TOOLS AND IMPORTANTLY LIKE REALLY CRITICAL INCENTIVES TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS WORK GETS DONE. ACCESSING ANY FILLERS AFTER DOLLARS REQUIRES SOME ELEMENT OF PLANNING AND IF THOSE PLANS ARE ADOPTED INTO THE GENERAL PEN PLAN GUIDANCE WHICH BY THE WAY WAS UNITED BECAUSE WE EVERYONE KNOWS WAS WERE UPDATED A COUPLE YEARS AGO- ACROSS THE BOARD. TO ADDRESS BETTER DISASTER RESILIENCE THEN THERE IS A POSSIBILITY TO EXPAND FUNDS EVEN MORE SO WE ARE YOU KNOW CONSTANTLY YOU KNOW TRYING TO. DO A QUICK CALL FORWARD TO INCENTIVIZE. BETTER PREPAREDNESS BETTER RESILIENCE YEAH- YOU KNOW THOSE DOLLARS ARE AVAILABLE IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF. SO MUCH THAT HAS HAPPENED HERE WE WANT TO LEVERAGE THOSE DOLLARS TO THE MAXIMUM BENEFITS TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES. AGAINST WILDFIRES AND OTHER THREATS THESE ARE THESE ARE ALL HAZARDS. PROGRAMS AND WE CAN'T LOSE SIGHT OF. OTHER THINGS AS WELL THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR PROTECTION AS OF OUR POPULATION INCLUDING. FLOOD RISK AS WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER. AND VERY IMPORTANTLY EARTHQUAKE REST SO THOSE ARE THOSE ARE AB. AND RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE. FOR IMPROVEMENTS. THANK YOU SO MUCH I APPRECIATE THAT AND ONE OF THE ARMS WILL FOLLOW UP WITH- WITH THE SOUND OF ALL AND REALLY APPRECIATE HIS WORK RATE YOU THANK YOU- IS AN ISSUE AS WE MOVE FORWARD. I THINK YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IN REGARDS TO THE FUNDS OBVIOUSLY THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH RIGHT. TO BE ABLE TO DO BEFORE THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO GET YOUR YOUR TAKE ON- UPDATING STANDARDS OBVIOUSLY WE'VE UPDATED BUILDING CODES. BUT LOOKING AT UPDATING POTENTIAL STANDARDS FOR DEVELOPMENT SPECIALLY IN THOSE HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES IT SENATE BILL TWENTY TWO WHICH IS JACKSON'S BILL. WOULD HAVE. PUT A PAUSE ON THAT KNOW THAT THERE ARE CONCERNS IN REGARDS TO THE RENEWED CYCLE ON HOW THAT WOULD HAVE MESSED UP. THIS UPCOMING RENEWAL CYCLE AT THE SAME TIME THOUGH. WE CONTINUE TO BUILD IN AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN HIT BY WHILE THEM FIRE. TWO THREE TIMES- AND- IT IS IT IS IT TIME FOR THE STATE TO START. IMPLEMENTING A PROGRAM VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH FLOODING WHERE- AND IT'S A SENIOR PROGRAMMER WE BUY OUT THOSE BUILDING RIGHTS. COMPENSATE THOSE. FOLKS WHO ARE IN A FLOOD ZONE SO THAT WE DON'T CONTINUE TO SEE THOSE INSURANCE LOSSES AND THE PUBLIC PICKING UP THE TIME TO BE ABLE TO REBUILD. SO I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GETTING TO THAT POINT IN THE STATE ESPECIALLY AFTER A SEASON THAT WE SEEM TO FOUR MILLION ACRES I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE CRITICAL DISCUSSION OF THE LEGISLATURE IS GONNA HAVE TO HAVE CONTROVERSIAL ONE TOUGH ONE BUT- ONE THAT I THINK IT'S GONNA TO HIT THANK YOU SO MUCH AND MAY TAKE UP SO MUCH TIME MAKING THEM TO BE DIRECTOR THINKING AFTER. THANK YOU CENTER- WE HAVE. FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY AND THEN AFTER THAT- I HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ IN THE QUEUE. WELL THANK YOU. CHAIR AND I'LL JUST BE REAL QUICK I HAVE ONE VERY- IMPORTANT QUESTION TO ME AND I THINK IT'S ONE OF OUR MORE- VULNERABLE PARTS OF OUR POPULATION IS SO EASILY OVERLOOKED OR PEOPLE THAT HAVE COMMUNICATION. A DISABILITIES DO DO WE HAVE ANY SYSTEM IN PLACE THAT HELPS US IDENTIFY- WHERE SOME OF THESE PEOPLE MAY BE RESIDING OR ANY KIND OF A- SPECIAL WAY TO COMMUNICATE I'M I'M SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY TO VISUALLY IMPAIRED PEOPLE AND ALSO- HEARING IMPAIRED PEOPLE. OF THEY DON'T NECESSARILY ALWAYS FOLLOW THE SAME PATH OF COMMUNICATION THAT MANY OF US WHO DON'T SHARE THOSE THOSE CHALLENGES HAVE. AND I THINK THEY'VE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS SOME OF THE TRAGEDIES IN THE PAST AND HELD THAT THERE WAS REALLY NO RECOGNITION OR- SPECIAL PATHWAY TO. REACH OUT AND IDENTIFY AND I KNOW THAT THIS WOULD REQUIRE EXTRA COOPERATION WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT BUT I DO THINK THAT IT IT GETS UNDER EMPHASIZED I'VE WONDERED. YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. ISSUE WE- JUST TO KIND OF TRY TO MAKE ASSISTING TO RESPONSE THE BUT IT BUT IMPORTANT- TO TALK ABOUT IS WE DO HAVE AN OFFICE OF ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS HERE AT CALLOW YES FOR THE VERY PURPOSE. OF ENSURING THAT ARE PLANNING A RESPONSE OR RECOVERY IS ALL DONE IN SUCH A WAY. THAT RECOGNIZING OF THE DIVERSE POPULATION OF CALIFORNIA PARTICULAR THOSE WITH ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS AND THAT IS- YOU KNOW THEY'RE REALLY IMPAIRED HEARING IMPAIRED ELDERLY. YOU KNOW ANYONE THAT- THAT REQUIRES AND THAT KIND OF A IT IS A RECOGNITION AND IN THE PLANNING AND HOW AND HOW WE DELIVER SERVICES. THE ISSUE OUT OF IDENTIFYING LOCATION YOU KNOW REGISTRIES IS A TERM. THAT CAN BE TRICKY- IT IS- IT IT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW HOW TO GET INTO THAT YOU SEE ASPECTS IT'S A CHALLENGE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO MAINTAIN. AND THINGS LIKE A LESS HOWEVER HELLO YES HAS DEPLOYED IN FACT THERE WAS LEGISLATION REQUIRING US TO DO SO. GUIDANCE ON A DISASTER REGISTRIES FOR- ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS POPULATIONS OF A LOCAL GOVERNMENT DOES DO IT THEY DO IT IN SUCH A WAY THAT ENSURES SECURITY. ENSURES THAT COMMITMENT TO MAINTAIN AND- YOU KNOW IT REALLY PROVIDES A REALISTIC- AT COMMITMENT TO THOSE POPULATIONS ABOUT WHAT IT IS THEY NEED TO DO FOR THEMSELVES BUT ALSO WITH THEIR COMMUNITIES. ARE PREPARED TO DO FOR THEM- AND THAT YOU KNOW THAT'S MANY MANY OTHER- FUNCTIONS OF THAT OFFICE- ADVANCE TAYLOR FROM OUR STAFF WHO JUST WORKS TIRELESSLY. BUTTERY RESPONSES ASTERS IN PREPARATION IN CALIFORNIA REALLY HAS MADE TREMENDOUS STRIDES I'M ONE OF THE- ANOTHER RECENT AND- LEARNING LEARNING SPECIFIC- ED IMPROVEMENT IS AID TRANSLATION- GUIDE WE HAVE MULTIPLE LANGUAGES IN CALIFORNIA. IT HAPPENS- SO. IS ON OUR WEBSITE THE REFERENCE CAL START OR- WHERE ALL OF THIS INFORMATION AND BAD INCLUDE IN THAT. IS A RESOURCE LIBRARY THAT A LOT OF GOOD. INFORMATION AND- TO AND INCLUDE. TRANS YOU KNOW SAYS MASS. AND THEN TRY. YOU KNOW ALL THESE THINGS TO HELP COMMUNITIES AND LOCAL. BE ABLE TO ADD JUST A BAD THOSE INTO THEIR SYSTEMS AND THEIR PLANNING- BUT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING UP THE ISSUE. ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS THAT IS A- CRITICAL AREA. YEAH I COULD JUST GIVE YOU A QUICK EXAMPLE OF BEING A PERSON WHO HAS ACTUALLY HAD TO EVACUATE FROM THEIR HOME IT WAS EARLY AM. NOTIFICATION AND THE WAY I WAS NOTIFIED WAS THE SHARED DRIVE THROUGH WITH THEIR PA SYSTEMS AND THEY TELL EVERYBODY IT'S A MANDATORY. EVACUATION SYSTEM IF I WAS A DEAF PERSON THERE IS NO WAY IN THE WORLD I WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT THAT WAS HAPPENING. AND SO THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE NEED TO BE AWARE OF. AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO OVERCOME IN SOME WAY. THANK YOU OUR NEXT WE HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ WITH A QUESTION. THANK YOU CHAIR RIVAS AND THANK EVERYBODY FOR PARTICIPATING ALSO A REAL QUICK QUESTION I KNOW THE BEGINNING OF THE DISCUSSION WE TALKED ABOUT COMMUNICATING WITH THE THAT COMMUNITIES ARE THAT ARE BE IMPACTED FROM THE FIRES SO- I KNOW WE TALKED A BIT ABOUT THE USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA APPS- THAT FOLKS CAN RELATE TO AND GET INFORMATION. AND DO WE SEE MAYBE IN THE NEAR FUTURE OR DO WE HAVE A TIME LINE WHEN WE MAY LOOK AT A TYPE OF- WARNING SYSTEM FOR FIRES LIKE WE DO FOR EARTHQUAKES I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF WAYS WE CAN COMMUNICATE BUT IT'LL BE NICE TO HAVE SOME TYPE OF FAMILIAR TOOLS OR APP. LIKE WE DO WHAT THE EARTHQUAKE WARNING SYSTEMS AND JUST CURIOUS IF WE ARE LOOKING AT SOMETHING LIKE THAT DO WE HAVE LIKE A YEAR TO YOUR TIMELINE ON WE WILL SEE IT. W. IMPLEMENTED- HI THIS IS TINA AND AGAIN IF CHIEF DEBBIE TOLD ME WANTS TO WEIGH IN ON THIS ONE TO ONE OF THAT ONE OF THE RECENT ACTIONS THAT. TOOK PLACE IS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A WILDFIRE INTEGRATION CENTER AND THAT'S REALLY. THAT BAD AND I WAKE NEW CONSOLIDATE THERE'S WEATHER WARNINGS THERE'S YOU KNOW DIFFERENT ENTITIES LIKE OUR UTILITIES THAT ARE ALL PROCESSING. A LOT OF DATA AND A LOT OF INFORMATION AND THAT. THE I THINK EVERYONE'S GOAL IS TO. BE MORE REFINERIES REFINED AS POSSIBLE ON WILDFIRE THREAT. WHICH IN TURN CAN. PARLAY INTO BETTER ALERTS AND WARNINGS ACROSS THE BOARD SO I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT AND THAT THAT IS EIGHT. EIGHT SOMETHING THAT'S UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND IN THE PROCESS OF STANDING UP IT'S A PARTNERSHIP WITH CAL FIRE. AND THAT'S MORE- YOU KNOW NOT SPECIFICALLY WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT REALLY TO IMPROVE. THE WAY THAT WE COORDINATE AND PROCESS THE DATA. THAT IS HEN- KIND OF TRANSLATED INTO. OUR WARNINGS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE OUT FOR WILDFIRES YOU KNOW WHETHER THAT'S A GRADUATION WARNINGS OR- RED FLAG WARNINGS OF TERRORIST SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU'LL BE SEEING MORE AT AS WE- AS WE- GO DOWN THE PATH TO. IMPLEMENT THAT- BUT IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW EVEN MORE AT TOOLS FOR THE PUBLIC ABSOLUTELY WE KNOW THERE'S ADVANTAGES TO- TO SIMPLIFYING THAT AGAINST. ALL HAZARDS STATE SO WE'RE ALWAYS MINDFUL OF. YOU KNOW DOES NOT HAVE A TOO MANY THINGS- IN AND TRY TO PACKAGE AS MUCH AS WE CAN AND CONSOLIDATE AND COORDINATE WORK. WHERE WHERE IT'S POSSIBLE IN ORDER TO SIMPLIFY AND STREAMLINE. THE IT ULTIMATELY HOW WE RELATE AND AGAIN. REDUNDANCY YOU KNOW THE EARTHQUAKE EARLY WARNING SYSTEM. HAS REDUNDANT PATHWAYS AND THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT- SHOULD WE- ENTER INTO ANY TYPE OF NEW. TECHNOLOGY. FOR AWHILE FOR WORDS. AND THIS IS TOLD ME OUT I WILL TOUCH ON JUST A LITTLE BIT THAT- AS GW DIRECTOR COURAGE WE ARE WORK. IN A- WILL BRINGING LOT OF DATA ASK THE IN THE PLACE YOU. EXPEDITE OF THAT INFORMATION- BOTH TO OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT PARTNERS. STATE PARTNERS AS WELL AS TO THE PUBLIC THEMSELVES. AND ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OBVIOUSLY WITH WILD FIRES EARTHQUAKES AS WE NEVER KNOW WHERE THAT FIRE IS GOING TO START. AND SO WILL CONTINUE TO FOR FOCUSED ON- THE PREVENTIVE INFORMATION- FOCUSING ON THE FAR HIGHER HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES- THE INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN THOSE AREAS CHANGES WITH IN. A WEATHER SYSTEMS THAT ARE COMING IN THE INFORMATION FROM THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE TRYING TO THEIR FIRE WEATHER WATCHES. THE RED FLAG WARNING AND THEN THE OUTPUT FROM OUR OWN PREDICTIVE SERVICES WHERE WE CAN REALLY FOCUS IN MORE SPECIFIC ON AN AREA. OF BASED ON THE INDIVIDUAL FUEL CONDITIONS WITHIN A GIVEN YEAR- WHAT HEAT STRESS THEY'VE BEEN UNDER THE LIFE FEEL MORE SECURE. AND BEING ABLE TO FOCUS IN ON SPECIFIC INFORMATION. BUT NOT. IN MY MIND AT THE MOMENT DO WE HAVE THE CAPABILITY. OF FOR A PREVENTIVE MESSAGE AT THE CIVIC TOOK FROM A POTENTIAL START. OTHER THAN THE PREPARATION. IF I START WERE TO OCCUR. OKAY THANK YOU- I HAVE A QUESTION- FOR CHIEF BOB TOLD ME. OF SINCE WE HAVE YOU ON THE LINE. DO YOU THINK THAT CALIFORNIA SHOULD ADOPT A DIFFERENT CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM FOR FIRES RIGHT NOW RED FLAG WARNINGS ARE NOT VERY DISTRICT. DESCRIPTIVE TO THE PUBLIC SHOULD WE HAVE ADDITIONAL TERMS. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION CHAIR AT MY INITIAL INSTINCT IS THE- IF WE TAKE FOR INSTANCE THE HURRICANE WARNING SYSTEM THAT WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THAT THE SYSTEM THAT'S BEEN DEVELOPED OVER DECADES- FROM MY PERSPECTIVE ON LIKE FIRES WORKING THERE ARE FAIRLY STATIC LOW MOVIE PROCESS. WHERE WE'VE GOT- ABUNDANT NUMBER OF- MODELS THAT. THAT HAVE OR THAT HURRICANE A WELL IN IT- I. THE OF HURT. REPORT EVERTON LAND MAKES LANDFALL. IN AND RE- HAS PLENTY OF PREPARATION TIME AND CASES. IF WE LOOK AT THAT A WILD. AWHILE ARE VERY DYNAMIC AND DID THEY CAN CHANGE VERY QUICKLY BASED ON CHANGES IN WIND PATTERNS THAT ARE IMPACTING THE FIRE- MOVEMENTS ON THE PART THREE THE PUBLIC YOURSELF GOING FROM A FLAT GROUND TO A STEEP SLOPE THAT WILL RADICALLY CHANGE THE BEHAVIOR OF THAT FIRE- AND WE ARE YOU SEE CHALLENGES. WITH THE PUBLIC THEMSELVES ON UNDERSTANDING EVACUATION WARNINGS EVACUATION ORDERS FIRE WEATHER WATCHES- RED FLAG WARNINGS- ME THAT THE MORE IMPORTANT WE CAN KEEP THE SYSTEM. WHERE WE CAN READILY COMMUNICATE- TO THE PUBLIC ESPECIALLY WITHOUT CAUSING INCREASED CONFUSION IS A BATTLE BETTER MODEL IN MY MIND AT THIS POINT- WE ARE SEEING ADVANCES WITH THE- FIRES AND LYFT INFORMATION AND MODELS THAT ARE OUT THERE WE'VE MADE. GREAT PROGRESS WITHIN CAL FIRE WITH OUR OUR FIRE CAST IN A FIRE STEMS- PRODUCTS THAT WE'VE STARTED UTILIZED IN THIS YEAR WERE BETTER ABLE TO FORECAST. A MOVEMENT OF A FIRE ONCE IT STARTS. LET ALLOWS US TO WORK BETTER WITH THOSE LOW GOVERNMENT ENTITIES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT CAN BETTER- PREDICT AND EMPLOYMENT EVACUATIONS. NUMBER RIGHT NOW I'D STILL RECOMMEND WE STAY WITH WITH THOSE ITEMS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE FOR WARNING. IN BATTERY FINALS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR- I AM AND MY FINAL IS FOR- WE ASK. I DO YOU THINK THAT HEALTH. SHOULD HAVE A STATE WIDE ALERTING SYSTEM- LIKE THE STATE OF FLORIDA CURRENTLY DOES THAT IS CAPABLE OF BACKING UP LOCAL EMERGENCY ALERTING SYSTEMS. BUT WE HAVE THAT NOW AND I PROBABLY FAILED TO MENTION THE CALLOW YESES AND ALERTING AUTHORITY AND- IN SOME CASES- I COUPLE YEARS AGO- I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT DATE- WE ACTUALLY DID ISSUE- WIRELESS EMERGENCY ALERT AND THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AREA FOR CRITICAL WEATHER ALL OF IT POINTED- IN IF WE WERE TO DO THAT AGAIN THE FUTURE WOULD POINT. TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES LOCAL INSTRUCTIONS AND REALLY- AMPLIFY THAT MESSAGE WHERE NEEDED BUT THAT THOSE ARE DECISIONS THAT WE WOULD TALK THERE IN REAL TIME BUT WE ABSOLUTELY ARE AVAILABLE AS A BACK UP WE SEE OUR CALIFORNIA STATE WARNING CENTER AS- AN- AMONG THE FRAMEWORK OF THAT OR THE FACT THAT I HAVE THAT ALERTING AUTHORITIES IN CALIFORNIA FOR THAT VERY REASON. THE TALK ABOUT EARTHQUAKE EARLY WARNING A FEW TIMES THAT IS A VENTURE THAT THE STATE TOOK ON- A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT- YOU KNOW I'M LIKE FIRES THAT ARE UNPREDICTABLE WE KNOW KIND OF WHERE THAT EARTHQUAKE RISKS EXIST IN THE WAY THAT SYSTEM WORKS IT'S A LITTLE BIT PREDICTABLE IN TERMS OF. WORD EVER WHERE TO LINE UP THE CENTER NETWORK OF ULTIMATELY FEED INTO THOSE INTO THOSE AND NO NOTICE EVENTS- SO YOU KNOW WE DEFINITELY SEE OURSELVES AS A- A PARTNER WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT ABSOLUTELY ABLE TO ACT IN REAL TIME. AND TO PROVIDE THAT AT THE STATE LEVEL- FOR A MURDER MORNING AND SHOULD. SHOULD THE NEED ARISE. THANK YOU MS CURRIE AND- THIS CONCLUDE THE FIRST PANEL I WANNA THING- HELLO YES HELLO BUYER. DID SOMEONE HAVE A QUESTION I THOUGHT I HEARD SOMETHING I'M SORRY SO THANK YOU FOR TO BUY SO I SORT OF HAD TO GET UP TO SENATOR DODD- I'M SORRY SENATOR DODD. OKAY SURE IT WILL END UP STARTED PROLONG THIS MEETING. JUST WITH YOU KNOW I THINK I HAD SOME TOP TECH COLD. EARLIER AND- I DIDN'T HEAR THAT MAYBE THE ANSWER COURTS CENTER REQUIRES QUESTION I REMAIN VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT. YOUR BATTERY BACK UP FOR THESE CELL SITES THAT THEY CAN SOMETHING NOW IN THE THIRD MAJOR FIRE THAT- HAS BE SET MY DISTRICT OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS IT IS STILL ONE OF THE THINGS THAT JUST IS LOOMING.

GROW- FIRST I WANT TO START BY SAYING IT'S BEEN MY PLEASURE TO TEST FOR COMMITTEE A NUMBER OF TIMES OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS REGRETTABLY WE'RE DOING IT FROM A DISTANCE EACH YEAR BUT IT HAS- I GUESS MANY NEW NORMS ARE IN OUR LIVES NOW. I DON'T THINK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY IT DOES IT DOES BEING ABLE TO PRESENT AND DISCUSS SOME OF THE WORK TO BE DONE IN THE PAST AND LEANING FORWARD ON A PATH TO HOPEFULLY BUILD. A STRONGER AND BRIGHTER FUTURES MOVED FORWARD YOU THE WORKING TOGETHER WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED A LOT IN RECENT YEARS THAT MEMBERS OF BOTH HOUSES OF THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR- TOOK A VOTE OF FAITH IN APPROVED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR PRE POSITIONING OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT RESOURCES IN THE ADVANCE OF- WHETHER OR OTHER TYPES OF. RED FLAG OR WILD FIRES OR ANY OTHER CONDITIONS WERE WE CAN PREDICT IT IN ADVANCE IT TOOK A COUPLE YEARS FOR THE PROGRAM TO FULLY HIT ITS STRIDE BUT I WANT TO SAY THIS PAST YEAR- WE SAW REMARKABLE MOVEMENT UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BEING ABLE TO PLACE EMERGENCY RESPONSE RESOURCES- BETWEEN. AREAS THAT THAT WE FELT WE'RE GOING TO BE IN JEOPARDY AS A RESULT OF A RED FLAG CONDITIONS- THEY HAD NOTABLE IMPACTS ON THE ADDITIONAL PHASES OF THE INITIAL TACK OF SOME MAJOR INCIDENTS AND IN MANY CASES. HELP KEEP AN INCIDENT TO AN INITIAL ATTACK INCIDENT AND ONE THAT EVER REALLY MADE THE NEWS SO THE GOOD NEWS ON SOME OF THIS IS THAT THE INCIDENTS THAT WE HAVE BEEN GREATLY SUCCESSFUL PRE POSITIONING AREN'T THE ONES. THAT MAKE THE NEWS BUT- WITH THAT IT ALSO MAKES A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT TO TRACK ANY. ARTICULATE FOR YOU. ALSO WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST AND THE DISASTER FOR READY HIS. FIRST NAME FOR SAME PER COMMAND THAT CALL OF ALL THE- FIRE SERVICE. UP AND DOWN THE AND CAL WORK TOGETHER TO HELP DEVELOP. IT'S A STRATEGIES AND WORK FOR YEARS TO. IN THE- TO CONTINUE TO GO ON IS A CENTER IS CONTINUE TO MOVE. I WANT TO THANK YOU INCLUDING US IN A- FIRE CHIEF ASSOCIATION THE RED ALL FIRING UP AND DOWN THE OF. AND BE ABLE TO INCLUDE PORN ALSO LONG GUY PARTNER- THAT YOU KNOW CAL FIRE AND CAL YEAH R. OR- DUE TO. JOB BILL IN AND DAY OUT BUT THEY CANNOT DO A LOT OF THE TIME REALLY WE'RE TO TRY TO MANAGE. EMERGENCIES AND DOES. IN REALLY TAKE A VILLAGE YEAH. VERY FEW ANY OF TYPES OF ITS OCCUR OR DIRECTLY IN. A LOCAL GUY COMMUTER AND MOST MORE TO THAT KIND OF MOMENTS- TO THE KEY TO A IS THAT WE MUST BE AT THE TIME. AND WE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SIT AT THE TABLE. TODAY WELL WE'VE MADE GREAT. OER THE PAST COUPLE OF. AS AS WE ABOUT- AS WE ALSO STAR WITH THE TWO. EARLY UNDER STILL WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE- NATIONAL LEVEL THERE'S A NATIONAL COHESIVE WILDFIRE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY THAT'S BEEN ADOPTED EMPLOYED. WELL IT CERTAINLY HAS SOME AREAS THAT ARE RELEVANT WITHIN THE SENIOR CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA HAS SOME UNIQUE PRINCIPLES THAT EXIST. THAT'S A HARD WORK THE MIX IS DOCUMENTS MAYBE NOT AS STRONG AS WE WOULD IDEALLY LIKE BUT CERTAINLY A GOOD START. MOVING FORWARD. WE DO THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSIONS MOST RECENTLY. YOU KNOW AFTER THE FIRE SEASON IS A BIT TWO THOUSAND. AND WE CONTINUE TO BUMP IT UP. THE CHALLENGE WE RUN INTO IS THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THESE TYPES OF COMMITTEES DON'T END UP PAYING. BEING DROPPED INTO A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY TO BE ABLE TO MOVE US FORWARD. AND WHY IS A STRATEGY IMPORTANT. FOR FROM INCIDENT MANAGE FIRST IT DOESN'T MATTER IF WE'RE RESPOND. TO A NEED. AT HOME WITH A BROKEN ARM OR A MASSIVE WILDFIRE ORDER AS WE'RE CALLING THEM NOW WILL MAKE A FIRE IN TATING CALIFORNIA. IT ALL BEGINS WITH THIS DISCOUNT WISHING A SET OF COMMON- WIDELY KNOWN OBJECTIVES THEY WERE WORKING TO TRY TO ACHIEVE TO MITIGATE THE EMERGENCY. FROM THOSE OBJECTIVES WE MOVE INTO PUT IT DEVELOPING STRATEGIES TO ACCOMPLISH THE OBJECTIVES NOT BREAKING IT DOWN INTO SPECIFIC TASKS- JUST BEEN ARE PAIRED IN. OUR OPINION AND EXPERIENCE AS WE AS WE'VE DONE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK OVER THIS PAST FEW OF YEARS FROM. COMMUNICATIONS AND ALERTING AND FUEL MANAGEMENT AND- BUT JUST A TREMENDOUS TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK YOU KNOW THE CHAMPIONSHIP THAT'S BEEN DONE WITH SENATOR JACKSON OF THE WORK SHE'S DONE SENATE MCGUIRE. AND REALLY BOTH HOUSES OF THE LEGISLATURE AND ALL OF THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE- WE'D LIKE TO. PROPOSE AND PUT ON THE TABLE CONSIDERATION OF ADOPTING OR HIM. OR LEGISLATING THAT WE WORK TOWARDS BUILDING A COMPREHENSIVE A COHESIVE OVERARCHING STRATEGY. SO THAT SOME OF THE CONVERSATIONS ARE HAVING TODAY WHETHER IT'S WE-SHOULD HAVE ONE COMMUNICATION. SYSTEM STATEWIDE ORDERED SHOULD BE TO CENTRALIZED IN THE COUNTIES OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. WERE THAT CONVERSATION WOULD BE POINTED BACK TO YOU ONE OF THE COMMON OBJECTIVES WHAT IS THE OBJECTIVE WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE. DOES IT MATTER IF EACH SYSTEM IN EACH COUNTY IS ON A DIFFERENT SYSTEM AND CAN'T NECESSARILY OVERLAP WANTED EITHER. OR WOULD BE BETTER OFF HAVING WON STATEWIDE SYSTEM. SOME OF THE ELEMENTS IN MY OPINION IN OUR OPINION THAT NEED TO BE INCLUDED LOOKING AT. AND KNOW WE MADE SOME STRIDES IN STARTING WITH SOMEBODY JUST LIKE XINLAST YEAR MAYBE AB THIRTY ONE SIXTY FOUR. AND THAT'S MOVING FROM THE HAZARD BASED OR THE HAZARDS OWN MODELING TO A RISK BASED MODELING APPROACH. THIS IS TAKING. TAKING A PER. OF QUERY GLOW. IN WHICH- HAZARDS VERY ARE EXIT. BUT DOESN'T TAKE IN ACCOUNT ANYTHING BEEN DONE THE STRUCTURE TO MAKE MEMORIES. TO BE ABLE TO. A WILDFIRE. IT DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. ROADWAYS OR THE WITH THE- WHEN THERE'S NO WAYS IN MORE WAYS OUT ITS WAY THE- IS CHEN LOW. IN WALL. IT MAKES SENSE THOUGH USE THAT. PRO BECAUSE HAZARD FAIRLY STATIC IT DOESN'T CHANGE RIDLEY I'M A RISK IS FAR MORE DYNAMIC SOMEBODY COULD NOT HIRE. FOLKS TO COME OUT AND CLEAN THEIR PARCEL OFTEN IT CAN CHANGE FROM ONE DAY TO THE NEXT SO CAN BECOME VERY. DYNAMIC BUT I ALSO BELIEVE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD. WE NEED TO PUT GREATER EMPHASIS ON THE NUMBER REASONS OF STRUCTURES WE'VE MADE GREAT STRIDES WITH THE WILDFIRE CODE IN THE STATE BUT THERE'S STILL MORE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA. AS WORK THAT WE HAVE DONE WITH THE WESTERN FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION WILDFIRE POLICY COMMITTEES IDENTIFIED. TWELVE VULNERABILITIES THAT EXISTED ALL STRUCTURES IS THE CONTINUE TO EXIST. IN THAT WE TALKED ALSO ABOUT THE- PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY FROM FROM RISK MODELING TO ACTUARIAL WORK BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY BEING ABLE TO ACCESS THE I. B. H. S. WHICH IS THE INSURANCE INSTITUTE FOR BUSINESS AND HOME SAFETY. WHERE THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IS EIGHT NEW CHURCH INDUSTRY ALONE. TESTING LABORATORY WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING THE ROOF TIES FOR HURRICANE PRONE AREAS BECAUSE THEY IDENTIFIED THAT WANTS A STRUCTURED LOSES ITS ROOF. THE STRUCTURE WILL BE BOUND TO COLLAPSE AS A RESULT OF THE HEAVY WINDS IN HURRICANE PRONE AREAS. BUILDING THE ROOF TILES GREATLY REDUCE THE RISK AND IT ALSO BILL A BRIDGE BUILD UP THE RESILIENCE. OF THESE HOMES YEAH. HOW DO YOU JUST SEND SOME OF THE WORK WE'VE DONE WITH THE RESEARCH. HAS OPENED SOME OF THE STORES BUT WE BELIEVE THERE'S MORE TO BE DONE TO AND SOME OF THESE PARTNERSHIPS. WELL PARTNERINGWITH THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY MAY NOT BE INTUITIVE ON MANY FRONTS WE CAN'T DO ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER BECAUSE EVERY HOME IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS INSURED. SO HOW DO WE WORK TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE A COMMON GOAL OF RISK MANAGEMENT OUR COMMUNITIES. WE TALKED A LOT OVER THE PAST COUPLE YEARS OF FORCED HELPING FUEL MEDICATION BUT REALLY WHAT IS OUR OVERARCHING STRATEGY WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO ACHIEVE. THE UTILITIES THE HARDENING AND THE RESILIENCE YOU DON'T DO WE INVEST UP FRONT IT TO UNDERGROUND ALL UTILITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WOULD NOT BE AT ALL COMMITTED TO ACTIVE THAT WE SHOULD BE WORKING TOWARD SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT AN AND TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION. WE'VE TALKED A LOT TODAY ABOUT COMMUNITY READY TO SET A LEARNING BUT WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE. AS SOME OF THIS IS BEING DECENTRALIZED SOME LOCAL COMMITTEE. THAT ONLY TO EIGHT OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES THE STATE OF. ARE CURRENTLY IN. IN A PROBE IS SET JACK POINTED OUT CHAU THAT WE HAVE A TO DO. WHAT IS OUR OVER. OF IN THIS. AREA AND WE ARE SOME OF THE STRESS. WE CAN WORK TO MOVING OUR- FORWARD. AND LASTLY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TECHNOLOGY TECHNOLOGIES ARE REALLY IMPORTANT TO WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT IT FROM. THE ALERTING TO USING SOCIAL MEDIA AND INFORMING. WELL AS IT STANDS CURRENTLY EVEN FOR OUR FIRST RESPONDING ENTITIES RESPONDING TO SOME OF THESE MEGA FIRES. THAT OUR FIRST RESPONDERS NEED TO RELY ON SOCIAL MEDIA BLOGS TO BE ABLE TO READ RECEIVE WHAT WE'LL CALL REAL TIME INTELLIGENCE AS THEY RESPOND TO THESE INCIDENTS BECAUSE THAT INFORMATION IS NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. TO PEOPLE WHO ARE RESPONDING. HOW DO WE IMPROVE UPON THIS HOW DO WE BUILD UPON THIS. I WOULD LIKE TO PROPOSE. THAT WE YOU KNOW AS WE MOVE FOR LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS TO CREATE A CALIFORNIA COMPREHENSIVE A COHESIVE. WILDFIRE STRATEGY. BAG OUR VENTURE TO SAY THAT WE COULD EVEN GO BEYOND CALLING THIS A WILDFIRE STRATEGY AND PRODDED INTO AN ALL HAZARD ALL RISK APPROACH. BECAUSE FRANKLY THE WAY WE MANAGE THESE INCIDENTS IN THE STATE. WE WE'VE BEEN A LEADER FOR DECADES AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME A LEADER ONCE AGAIN. AND. CHAMPION AND MOVE FORWARD. WE ALSO LIKE. I GUESS FOR. TO THE COMMITTEE IN A- OF THIS YEAR AND BECAUSE- FIRE CHIEFS. PRESENT EVER UP. SUBMITTED A LOT TO COMMIT. REQUESTING SEVENTEEN MILLION. IN TO HELP MAKE SURE THE TECHNOLOGY WAS IN PLACE TO HELP US TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THE WORK THAT NEEDED TO BE DONE. FIRST AND FOREMOST WAS MAKING SURE THAT EVERY PIECE OF FIRE APPARATUS IN STEVIE CALIFORNIA HAD BACKED UP REALLY TO BE TRACKED THROUGH AUTOMATIC VEHICLE LOCATING DEVICES- THIS INVESTMENT. WAS PART OF THE DEAREST PROPOSAL IT WAS PART OF THAT THE- THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION. ASSOCIATED FOR. PRE POSITIONING IN MONEY THAT WAS SPECIFICALLY SET. ASIDE FOR INVESTING IN TECHNOLOGY. WE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO. THAT YEAH. FOR CONSIDER. IT IS IT'S- THE PRE POSITION REQUEST FROM JUST FIRE AGENTS TO HELPING US TO UP STAFF THE NEXT DEBT EXPANDED STATURE CAPABILITIES AND PRE POSITIONED DISPATCHERS IN AREAS THAT WE EXPECT TO BE HERE. S. NINE ONE ONE CALLS MOVED TO OUR PEACE ABSENT SECONDARY P. SAPS AND MAKING SURE THAT NO CENTERS HAVE THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO HANDLE. WHAT WE PROJECT TO BE INCREASED CALL VOLUME. NEXT WHILE THE STATE IS ADOPTED AND IT AKA DOCTOR REDUCE MOVING IN. THE FIRST THAT PLATFORM THEY WILL PER. YEAH CLICK SAFETY NETWORK IT GIVES- PUBLIC C. REESE PREEMPTORY ACCESS WHEN WILL NOT BE CA WITH THE CONSUMER SELLER NET- DIPLOMA OF IS SLOW AND- SB CHALLENGE MOSCOW IS ONE OF THE LAST WEEK SO I DIDN'T YEAH WE DID YEAH TO IS ALL VINCE TO MOVE FOR BUT WE ALSO HAVE A MASSIVE STATE INSURANCE FOR SOME FISH SERVICE TO BE TO MOVE FORWARD CAN GROW AND HELL. COMMUNICATION BUT MANY THESE COMING THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT BEING TO PUSH FROM OUT TO RESPONSE. THANK YES MAINTENANCE- EXIST FOR CAN TO WHETHER IT'S A FIRST NAME HELPING TO MANAGE PRE POSITIONING OF DISPATCH AMONG OTHERS RECKON THAT CAN MANAGED MADE WILL REQUIRE IT RE AS WELL THESE LOCAL WELL THERE'S A TON OF GREAT WORK HE CONTINUES TO MOVE ON- I'M JUST SO VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY I'M SO VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE SUPPORT THAT YOU'VE SHOWN IN RECENT YEARS AND I'M SURPRISED BE.

AS WAS WAS- MENTIONED- SENATE JACKSON- ANECHOIC SENATOR DODD. WE WE'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY AND FORTUNATELY MOST OF US TO BE IN A POSITION WHERE WE HAD TO BE EVACUATED BECOMES VERY PERSONAL IT'S VERY LOCAL. AND WE UNDERSTAND FIRSTHAND AT THE LOCAL LEVEL- OPPORTUNITIES- WHAT COMMUNITIES HAVE A NEW. YOUR DEGREE SIMILAR. IN BEHAVIOR WELL WE ALL KNOW THE THAT THEY DO HAVE- LOCAL I.

AN EXPANDED- AS A- CO AUTHOR MENTIONED DEPENDING ON HOW QUICKLY WE CAN GET TO A RESPONSE AND- MINIMIZE THINGS- HAS A LOT TO DO WITH HOW LARGE THEY GROW. BUT THE TYPICALLY SHARP LOCAL MONEY TYPICALLY AND LOCAL INS WERE SORT OF THAT TOP FIRST AND LAST MILE IF YOU WILL DELIVERY OVERSEE MANAGEMENT. I CAN JUST GIVE YOU A COUPLE. EXAMPLES ARE READY FOR SOME FORTUNE THE TRANSPLANT EMIC- NEARLY ALL COUNTIES ALL CITIES CURRENTLY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA EITHER HAVE DIRECTLY ACTIVATED EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER ARE THERE PARTICIPATING IN A- JOINT MERCY OPERATIONS CENTER. I KNOW CENTERS ARE ISSUING- DAILY SOMETIMES MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY- WHAT WE'D CALL- TWO NINE A SITUATION REPORT AND THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER. AND HELPS PROVIDE AN AMAZING LEVEL OF SITUATIONAL AWARENESS WHICH ALLOWS THEM TO TURN US TO MAKE- THIS AT THE STATE LEVEL ABOUT PRIORITIZING. AND WHERE WE WHERE WE SPREAD OUT THE SCARCE RESOURCES. IN THE STATE AND WHAT THE LOCAL SITUATION AS- AND FOR US TO DO THAT EFFECTIVELY- THIS IS WHERE YOU KNOW THAT IS. OFTEN MENTIONED- CALORIES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN GREAT PARTNERS- HAVE BEEN WILL CONTINUE TO BE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT. COM NO I WOULD REFERENCE THE UC CREDENTIALING WHICH IS A RELATIVELY NEW THE CALLOW YES. BUT IT'S TRAINING ON MY COUNTIES TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF AND WE ARE REAPING THE BENEFITS CARLY. THEY WERE ABLE TO COME ON SITE. TO OUR COUNTY IT'S REMOTE. IT'S A LOT EASIER TO BRING THAT TRAINING AND DRILLS TEAR LOCALIZE SETTING THAT IS TO DO IT SO. YOU KNOW TO DO IT NECESSARILY DISTANCE YOU'RE SENDING YOUR PEOPLE OFF. NOT AS A TEAM IN A COHORT THE BILL THAT THEY DON'T GET A BILL THAT SEARCHING MARC WE NEED SO MUCH NOW. I'M ANOTHER EXAMPLE- THERE WITH. IS THAT- IF YOU LOOK ACROSS AND WE YOU KNOW WE ALL GO TO THE STATE WEBSITE FOR INFORMATION ON KOBE NINETEEN IT'S- IT'S AMAZING COURT GET INFORMATION.

LOCAL FIRE SERVICES THE CITY COUNTY SPECIAL DISTRICT LEVEL. FROM WORK TO SPEEDING HEAVILY NUMBERS YOU MANAGEMENT. ONE OF THE REASONS THAT SORT OF AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE FROM WILD FOR MANAGEMENT IS SEARCHING COUGHLIN MENTIONED. I IF YOU TOOK A POLL YOU FIND AT A SURPRISING NUMBER OF THE- VERSUS OPERATIONS CENTERS. HOW FAR PERSONNEL AND KEY POSITIONS LIKE- PLANNING AND LOGISTICS BECAUSE THE EXERCISE THOSE VERY SPECIALIZED AND VERY PERSONABLE SKILLS ON A REGULAR BASIS AND WELFARE MANAGEMENT. AND THEY'RE PROVING EXTRAORDINARILY EFFECTIVE NOW- DURING A PANDEMIC WERE TRYING TO PUSH OUT. MILLIONS OF MASKS HAND SANITIZER OTHER PPP- SUPPORT TO OUR COMMUNITY NEEDS THE PEOPLE IN QUARANTINE AT SETRA. AND SO- I'LL JUST CLOSE HERE- I KNOW WE'LL GET A LOT OF GROUND TO COVER- PLEASE KEEP. YOUR CONTINUED SUPPORT WHICH WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE. PLEASE KEEP US INVOLVED AT THE TIME TO CALL THE IMPLEMENTATION LEVEL INCLUSION. FOR EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT POLICY FORMATION. WE'RE ALL THE CURRENT LOCAL AND LOCAL THANK YOU MANAGER AND I'LL BE GLAD ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS I CAN. THANK CHIEF I'M NEXT. THE FIRE DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE TOM WELCH DEPUTY FIRE CHIEF OF THE SUB SOUTHERN MARIN FIRE DISTRICT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR ASSEMBLY MEMBERS YOU SENATORS I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY A PRIVILEGE TO SPEAK TO YOU ON BEHALF. OF THE FIRE DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA AFTER WE APPRECIATE BEING A PART OF THIS IMPORTANT AND ESSENTIAL CONVERSATION. MY NAME IS TOM WATER SERVICES DEPUTY CHIEF OF OPERATIONS A TRANSIT SOUTHERN PROTECTION DISTRICT IN THE MILL VALLEY FIRE DEPARTMENT. WE'RE LOOKING IN THE SOUTHERN PORT OF CENTER. DISTRICT TODAY I AM PROVIDING A LOCAL. THE BEST PRACTICE IS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY IN PROPOSED LEARNING IN TIME FINALLY MAKE IT MASS DIFFERENCE IN OUR SUCCESSES AND FAILURES REGARDING COMMUNITY. I ALSO- INTENDED ON LOCAL ISSUES SURROUNDING ALERTS WARNINGS AND EVACUATIONS THREE BASIC ARCHITECTS. WAS BACK IT'S INCLUDES EDUCATION OUTREACH MITIGATION EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND EDUCATION. BUT FIRST I MUST BRIEFLY EXPLAIN THE FIVE PHASES EVACUATION FOR HOLISTIC CONTEXT WITH A FINER POINT OF FOCUS SO WHEN WE SEEK TO REFORM EVACUATION CONCEPTS IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE PHASES OF THE OCCUPATION ARE WE ARE STREAMLINING. I'M USING A PRACTICAL NARRATIVE TO MAKE A POINT MRS SMITH CALLS NINE ONE ONE. OR THE FIRE ON THE HILL IN YOUR BACKYARD. SHE IS A PROVIDED IMMEDIATE INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE DISPATCHER I TO TAKE PROTECTIVE ACTIONS SO THE FIRST PHASE INCIDENT DETECTION AND RESPONSE CHRIS. ARE THESE DAYS I CAN WORK QUITE WELL IN THE SUBURBAN OR URBAN AREAS WHERE WE HAVE AN INTERCONNECTED. THREE AND A QUICK NOTIFICATION CAN HAPPEN BUT IN THE RURAL AREAS THIS CAN BE MORE CHALLENGING. BUT WE PLACE STRATEGIC CAMERAS CALIFORNIA. I'M WEATHER STATIONS OUT IN THE AREA TO HOW US. WITH IDEA. PROJECT I DECISION TIME SO FIRST OFF RESP UNDER WAY. ORANGE WILL LOSE YOUR THINGS OF THAT SO. SHINS AND THE EXTENT OF POSSIBLE CONDITIONS THE FUTURE BASED ON WHETHER YOU WANT TO POVERTY. AT THIS TIME TO MAKE A DECISION ON WHO IS AT RISK AND- WHO NEEDS TO BE NOTIFIED FIRST THIS USUALLY HAPPENS WITH ALI BOB COURSE. IN FIRE DEPARTMENT PARTNERSHIP KNOWN AS UNIFIED COMMAND IT TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO MAKE THIS DECISION UNDERSTAND SO. THE WARNING TIME PHASE INFORMATION IS PASSED OFF TO OUR DISPATCHERS ARE OFFICE WORKS YOU SERVICES- WHERE THEY DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE NOTIFICATION LEVEL PLATFORM NECESSARY WILL USE NEXT ALL VERSES REVERSE NINE ONE ONE VERSES WE AT. VERSES THE EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM TO MAKE THE NOTIFICATION. OF THIS TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO UNDERSTAND MINUTES AND SECONDS AND TO GET THAT INFORMATION OUT. ON THE NEXT PHASE IS OPERATION TIME FACE THIS IS ABOUT THE COMMUNITY IS THE COMMUNITY READY TO GO. PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES TAKEN THE TIME TO COMMUNICATE RISKS AND EXPECTATIONS THE COMMUNITY YOU HAVE A PLAN THEY UNDERSTAND THE PLAN TO DO STAND THEIR ROLE. IN THE PLAN. ARE YOU CAN DO EVERYTHING RIGHT IN INCIDENTS JACKSON DECISION TIME WARNING TIME. BUT IF THE COMMUNITY IS NOT PREPARED TO GO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE CHALLENGES. FINALLY IS NETWORK CLEARING TIME HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO CLEAR UP A PARTICULAR NEIGHBORHOOD. OR PARTICULAR AREA GENERALLY THIS IS THE RANGE. THERE'S A MILLION WAYS TO FELLOW DOCUMENTATION. I WHETHER IT'S. A CAR CRASH OR- ALL ON BOARD FALLING ACROSS YOUR- AND SO ON. THE RANGER OF TIME. IS THE SAME. IF YOU ARE IN ALL OF FACE ARE WHICH ALL COULD YOU SOME. SOME FOR. ON THIS IS YOUR EVACUATION TIME AND- IT'S IMPORTANT FOR COMMUNITIES TO UNDERSTAND AT LEAST HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING. SO WE'RE FOCUSED ON AREAS THAT ENHANCE AND STREAMLINE EACH PHASE OF THE EVACUATION OF THE SPEECH FROM. LOCAL GOVERNMENT PERSPECTIVE HERE ON THE FIRST MARKET THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT COMMUNITY EDUCATION NOT REACH RELATING TO THAT QUESTIONS. I JUST SAID WE STRUGGLE TO REACH ALL POPULATION SEGMENTS THREE MULTI MODAL APPROACH USING TECHNOLOGY AND LAST SECOND TECHNOLOGICAL METHODS. IF WE COULD IMPROVE THIS WE WOULD FACILITATE COMMUNITY PROPER TAXES. SO THE QUESTION IS DOES THE COMMUNITY IT DOES THE COMMUNITY KERR IS THE COMMUNITY SIGNED UP FOR ALERTS WARNINGS DO THEY UNDERSTAND THE RISKS COMPLAINING RESPONSIBILITIES DURING EVACUATION. I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE ONLY PENETRATING APPROXIMATELY 25% ALTHOUGH WHEN THERE SEEMS TO BE SMOKE IN THE AIR WE PENETRATE. FAR MORE. PRINT OUT PREVENTATIVE COMMUNICATIONS BEFORE EVACUATION ASCENTIAL CANNOT UNDERESTIMATE THE VALUE OF STRUCTURAL HARDENING THAT STATION MANAGEMENT. RAN THROUGH FIRE SAFE COUNCILS WOULD FACILITATE COMMUNITY PRACTICES AND OUR CURRENT. IF THE STRUCTURES ARE BURNING IT IS AND- DEFINITE EXPERIENCE EVACUATING IN THE MIDST OF A FIRE I WHEN THEY ARE BURNING IT IS A FAR MORE DANGEROUS. WE FUNDING TO ASSIST WITH EDUCATION AND CAN ACTUALLY AND- OUR COMMUNITY EVACUATION PLANS SUCH AS MAILERS APPS AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES THIS FACILITATES COMMUNITY PROPER NETWORKS DURING PHASES IN THE SOUTHERN NEVADA AREA WE'VE IDENTIFIED MALE SWITCHED TO DISTRACTIONS ANYMORE. ENGINE FIVE THE PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EVACUATION ROUTES FOR EACH REGION OF OUR COMMUNITY WE'VE IDENTIFIED COMMUNITY RUSSIAN JOURNALISTS WHERE PEOPLE CAN GO AS AN AREA OF LAST RESORT AND- HUNKER DOWN UNTIL THE SITUATION IMPROVES AND- I'LL LAW ENFORCEMENT TELLS THEM THAT SAFETY LEADS. WE ALSO BELIEVE IN INTER CONNECTING OUR NEIGHBORHOODS TO ENHANCE THE SURVIVABILITY ALL RESIDENTS CONDUCTING COMMUNITY EVACUATION DRILLS FORMING NEIGHBORHOOD RESPONSE GROUPS IF YOU DON'T PRACTICE I MIGHT NOT BE SUCCESSFUL ON GAME DAY. THESE ACTIVITIES FACILITATE THE WARNING TIME THE SOLDIER COMMUNITY PREPARATION FAST AND NETWORK CLEARING TIME CASES THEY MAKE EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS OUR HAVE. EVERYBODY UNDERSTAND SLAP. NEXT MITIGATION. WHEN FOCUS ON FUEL REDUCTION THIS ARE. ACTION WORKS LOOSEN THIS OUT TO FIVE SO NETWORK CLEARING A RISK AND AS WELL AS I DID IT. DETECTION TIME PHASES SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE'RE REDUCING FUELS ALONG PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EVACUATION ROUTES THIS REDUCES THE INTENSITY OF FIRE AS RESIDENTS ARE MAKING THEIR WAY OUT WE'RE REDUCING FUELS AROUND CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE RESIDENTIAL COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS WE ARE CHASING STRATEGIC FUEL RACKS THAT SERVICE AFTER THE FDA FOR SUPPRESSION EFFORTS WHAT CAN I JUST COMMUNITY FACILITIES AT OTHER TIMES HIKING TRAILS BIKING TRAILS. THAT THE MITIGATION ON TAX THIS ONE. MEMBERS RESPONSE IN THE WE NEED FIND TO LIVE REAL. DATA HELLFIRE COMMUNICATIONS MAPPING SUCH AS WAZE WILL NOT ANOTHER SO AFRAID ARE NETWORK LEARNING- UNDER. WE NEED TO BUILD OUT. TO PROVIDE FOR AUTOMATIC VEHICLE LOCATION OUR FIRE ENGINES POLICE CARS SYSTEMS FOR IMPROVED BETTER ORGANIZED RESPONSE IS ENHANCES OUR INCIDENT DETECTION RESPONSE UNDERSTANDING. WE NEED FUNDING FOR UP STAFFING AND PRE POSITIONING OUR DISPATCHERS DURING HIGH FIRE DANGER PERIOD DISTANT HOUSES INCIDENT DETECTION RESPONSE SPACE. OTHER EVACUATION TECHNOLOGIES UTILIZED IN NEED A CURRENTLY IN THE SOUTHERN. OUR USED THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE LONG RANGE ACOUSTICAL DEVICE BY GENESIS CORPORATION THIS IS AN OUTDOOR LEARNING SYSTEM THAT ADDS REDUNDANCY TO OUR OUR AREA PROVIDES REAL TIME INSTRUCTIONS. CREATED SO THAT. WORKS WITH A SATELLITE DOWNLINK AND BATTERY BACKUPS FOR RESILIENCE YOUR JUDGMENTS. WE WORKING THROUGH PROGRAM OF THE NEW RADIO LOOKS- THIS SYSTEM IS TEMPORARILY- IS USED IN TORNADO ALLEY IN HURRICANE AREAS THROUGHOUT AMERICA WE'RE TRYING TO SEE IF IT WORKS FOR US DOWN HERE. WE ARE DOING AND NEED FUNDING FOR EVACUATION MODELING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND TRAFFIC CHOKEPOINTS OPPORTUNITIES AFTER CONTRAFLOW ANOTHER TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES TO CONSIDER HUMAN BEHAVIOR ARE UNDER STRESS THIS WILL STRESS WITH OUR NETWORK CLEARING TIME UNDERSTAND. SO GOALS FOR SYSTEMS AS YOU CONSIDER POLICY DEVELOP LEGISLATION FINALIZE BUDGETS ARE WE ASK THAT YOU CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING BUILD SYSTEMS THAT OFFER REDUNDANCY EDUCATION COMMUNICATION RESPONSIBLE PERSON OF CATIA. BUILDER ONE RULES RESILIENT SYSTEMS FOR ALL RISKS NO SIMPLE SYSTEMS THAT WORK FOR THE COMMUNITY AND OVERSEE RESPOND OR SPEAK. LET'S THEIR SCALABLE USABLE. AT THE LOCAL AND REGIONAL LEVEL BILL SYSTEMS FOR INTER OPERABILITY STUDENT. THANKS FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TODAY TO OFFER A LITTLE PERSPECTIVE ON ISSUES ENSURE WHAT YOU SHARE WITH YOU WHAT WE ARE UP TO. I REGARDING ALERTS WARNINGS AND EVACUATIONS AND ALL STAMPED WITH MY PEERS IN THE PAST IT'S- THANK YOU I'M NEXT WE HAVE BRIAN RICE- PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS. MANAGER THANK YOU VERY MUCH INTO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME SPREAD RIGHT AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS. I SPENT MY FIRE SERVICE CAREER IT IS SACRAMENTO METROPOLITAN FIRE DEPARTMENT IN AND SOMEWHAT UNIQUE TO LABOR BECAUSE I RETIRED OUT IN MANAGEMENT POSITION AS A DEPUTY CHIEF OF OPERATIONS. AND I'M GONNA TOUCH ON A COUPLE OF BULLETS THAT I WAS ASKED. YOU KNOW TO BE PREPARED FOR AND- I'M IN WOULD BE THE LAST FIRE SEASON UNDER MUTUAL AID INCIDENTS- AND HOW KOBE- INTERACTED OR DIDN'T INTERACT WITH SOME OF OUR MAJOR RESPONSES AND I CAN SAY THAT INITIALLY- AS WE WATCHED IN CALIFORNIA PUT- AND- YES PUT A NUMBER. OF SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE FROM THE BASIC HYGIENE RULES THAT WE ALL FOLLOW AND I THINK A COUPLE THINGS HAPPEN IN OUR FAVOR THAT- WE FOLLOWED A HYGIENE PROTOCOLS AND WE GOT LUCKY- THAT- COULD REALLY DIDN'T PAY- BIG PART. IN THE MUTUALLY CRISP AND THAT A VERY THING. AND I KNOW THIS BILL ASK CAL OR TO- REFER- WHAT WE BEEN DOING IT WHAT WE DO. AND NOW WILL DO RESULTS. I DO WANT TO COME BACK TO THE COLD MAKE PEACE AS I WRAP UP- SOME OF THE OTHER DISCUSSION THAT I WAS ASKED TO COMMENT ON WOULD WOULD BE A NEW SYSTEM THAT CATEGORIZES FIRED- FIRES BY DANGER OR BY EXPOSURE. IN CHIEF CURRY. WAS EXACTLY RIGHT ON POINT WITH THE NEW ORDERS THE EVACUATION ORDER EVACUATION. WARNING AND THE SHELTER IN PLACE- AND I WAS REALLY THINKING ABOUT THIS AND- CHIEF MCLAUGHLIN- THREE VOTES EVERYBODY KIND OF TOUCHED ON IT. AND IS THERE A WAY TO K. A WILDFIRE IN THE DANGER THE COMMUNITY THAT THE COMMUNITY- WHAT HE DID. AND UNDERSTAND IT AND ACT APPROPRIATELY. I THINK THAT THERE IS I DON'T THINK THAT- IT'S GOING TO BE- A- AN INSTANT FIX BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE NATIONAL CONVERSATION. WE'VE BEEN HAVING IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS MOST OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC NOW IS- IT'S GEARED TO THAT QUOTE UNQUOTE THE FAKE NEWS OR THE CONSPIRACY THEORY SO I THINK WE HAVE TO BE VERY VERY MEASURED. AND REALLY- INTERACT WITH THEIR COMMUNITIES AS WE DEVELOP THAT AND THEN MAKE IT- THE METRICS ARE WARNING SYSTEM DAY THAT- ONE MEMBER OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC A MEMBER IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD YOU. CAN ACTUALLY APPLY TO THEMSELVES IT MEANS SOMETHING AND SIMPLE IS GOING TO BE. BETTER IN IN THAT. ARENA AND- JUST GIVE GOING TO BE A ONE BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND FIRE SEASONS WILL YOU KNOW AND WE'VE HEARD MAKE A FIRE WE'VE HEARD ALL OF IT AND THE ONE THING THAT WE WILL ALL AGREE UPON. IS THAT WE'RE SEEN FIRE BEHAVIOR NEVER SEEN BEFORE. AND IT AND WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE IT BUT COMMUNICATED IN A WAY THAT THE PUBLICDOES NOT GET NUMB TO IT AND THAT'S GOING TO BE THE TRICK TO IT. AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF THAT- SMART PEOPLE IN IT SHE TOLD ME- AND I THINK I PUT THIS TWENTY QUOTES PUBLIC CONFUSION- THERE'S JUST SOME THINGS THAT WE REALLY NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO IS WE DEVELOP BETTER TO GIVE THE PUBLIC. REAL TRYING USABLE INFORMATION BECAUSE WE CAN ALWAYS GO BACK TO. KNOWLEDGE IS POWER IF THEY HAVE GOOD KNOWLEDGE OF THE SITUATION AND SITUATIONAL AWARENESS PEOPLE CAN MAKE GOOD DECISIONS- WHAT THE OTHER ONES THAT ASKED TO TOUCH ON WAS- EVACUATE. IN THE FIRE CHIEF SHOULD REALLY TOUCHED ON THAT. IN THE NEED FOR MORE THAN ONE WAY ONE WAY INGRESS EGRESS- PROPER WARNING SYSTEMS. AND I'LL TELL YOU I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A BOOTS ON THE GROUND THEY SPENT SIXTEEN YEARS AS A FIRE CAPTAIN. ON THE FIRE COMPANY AND ALL THE FIRE CHIEFS ON THIS CALL WILL WILL BACK THIS UP. WHEN WE GO TO AN INCIDENT. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S- LARGE OR SMALL OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IS LIFE SAFETY. AND SAVING LIVES. AND IN THE INCIDENTS THAT WE'VE HAD WEATHER WAS THE CAR FIRE THE CAMPFIRE THE THOMAS FIRE AND THE ATLAS TUBBS UP IN SANTA ROSA- WE COULD HAVE HAD. AS ONE PERSON PUT IT TAKE THE CAMPFIRE YOU COULD PUT A THOUSAND ENGINES ON AVERAGE. AND THEY WEREN'T GOING TO BE ABLE TO STOP THAT WE'RE GOING TO VENT SOMETIMES- JUST GETTING PEOPLE OUT OF HARM'S WAY IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO FOR THE FIRST TEN OR TWELVE HOURS BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T GET- OUR COMMUNITIES OUT OF HARM'S WAY. THE INCIDENT JUST MAGNIFIES GREATLY AND I THINK THAT'S GONNA BE OUR CHALLENGE INTO THE FUTURE AND WHAT'S GOING TO PLAY A PART OF THAT WE JUST TALKED ABOUT IT- PRIOR TO THIS WAS THE METRICS DAY- WELL THE COMMUNITY CAN USE TO JUDGE WHAT THEIR SAFETY IS GOING TO BE THE AND WHEN THEY EAT TO GET OUT. IT'S ALL OLD BATHROOMS IN TOGETHER AND- IT IS SO CRITICAL THAT WE DO IT RIGHT FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT. YES TO CAL FIRE THAT WE DEVELOP AND BEEN WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT CONCERNS THE OTHER PART OF ANYTHING- CHIEF IDEAS ON HERE- FOR THE MOST PART PORTION ISSUES WHOSE GO TO CARRY OUT THIS. YOU WOULD BE A- PART OF THE- AND- THAT IS GOING TO EIGHTEEN EFFORT AND TEAM COMMITTEE. AND THAT SHOULD BE. DONE ON THE TOP FIVE OF LIST OF OUR THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO. THE OTHER ONE AND I'LL NEVER FORGET THIS I WAS AT THE CAMP FIRE WITH- GOVERNOR NEWSOM- ACTUALLY WAS GOVERNOR ELECT HE HAD NOT TAKEN OFFICE YET AND- WE TOOK THE GOVERNOR AT THEIR ANYONE DID SEE A COUPLE OF THINGS YOU WANT TO SEE THE FRONT LINE. YOU WANT TO SEE FIREFIGHTERS ON THE LINE AND HE WANTED TO VISIT IN EVACUATION CENTER AND I WILL NEVER FORGET THIS IT WAS BURNED INTO MY HEAD- WE RIPPED ONE OF THE EARLY EVACUATION CENTERS IN CHICO I BELIEVE IT WAS A CHURCH. AND THE GOVERNOR WAS SPEAKING TO SOME OF THE EVACUEES ANY ANY BASICALLY NOTE BY A LADY AN ELDERLY LADY THAT WAS- SHE WAS STRIPPED COVER. USE THAT HOSPITAL BED SHE HAD CATHOLIC- FORGET THIS SHE SAID TO HIM- WE DIDN'T KNOW WE DIDN'T KNOW WE HAD TO LEAVE WE DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS A FIRE AND HE TURNED IT IN I DON'T KNOW I FELT LIKE IT WAS TO ME BUT- HE TURNED IN AND- AS SHE WAS SAYING WE DIDN'T KNOW WE DIDN'T KNOW AND HE SAID. THAT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN. AND SO AS WE TALK ABOUT EMERGENCY- EVACUATION ORDERS IN I MEAN CHIEF MCLAUGHLIN EVERYBODY CITY- ALL FORMS OF SOCIAL MEDIA- RADIO TV FACEBOOK INSTAGRAM- YOU KNOW MAYBE WE NEED TO ALSO LOOK AT SOME OF THESE PLACES. THAT ARE IN THE DANGER ZONE I YOU KNOW I'M I LIVE UP IN PLUMAS COUNTY INTO THE SECURITY AREA AND MAYBE SOMETIMES THE OLD FASHIONED. CIVIL DEFENSE. CAN BE. THAT ISN'T ALERT TO GET PEOPLE TO LOOK AT- WHETHER IT'S THEIR TV OR THE RADIO. DON'T FORGET THAT SOMETIMES JUST THE SIMPLEST THINGS CAN WORK VERY VERY WELL WHEN IT COMES TO- INFORMING INFORMING PEOPLE THAT THE DANGER THE OTHER ONE AND THIS ONE IT WAS INTERESTING TO LISTEN TO THE DISCUSSION ON THIS- AKTIV THERE IT. FOR LOCAL ALERTS YOU KNOW WE CAN GO FROM OPTED TO PARTICIPATE IN LOCAL ALERTS I THINK THE DAY IN AGE OF OPTING IN. WHEN IT COMES TO- A DISASTER OR NATURAL DISASTER IN CALIFORNIA OVER. THERE'S THERE SHOULD BE NO WHAT DID YOU EAT IT SHOULD BE AUTOMATIC RADIO TV CELLPHONE LANDLINE- YOU LIVE IN CALIFORNIA WHERE EARTHQUAKES FROM I FORGOT ABOUT TSUNAMI TRONG OF MUDSLIDES AFTER FIRES FIRES CIVIL UNREST THERE SHOULD BE NO OPT IN OPT OUT YOU. CAN WE AS S. CALIFORNIANS WE ACTUALLY HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO BE CALIFORNIA'S CITIZENS AND THAT RESPONSIBILITY FOR ME IS. MY NEIGHBOR BOB HIS WIFE ACROSS THE STREET WHO ARE EIGHTY YEARS OLD IF SOMETHING HAPPENS ELLEN AND I KNOW THAT I CAN HANDLE MY OWN BUSINESS I NEED TO CHECK ON MY NEIGHBORS YOU NEED TO BE RESPONSIBLE CALIFORNIA. AND THERE ARE SOME OF THESE AREAS THAT- OPT IN AND OPT OUT THAT SHOULD BE PART OF OUR VOCABULARY YOU LIVE HERE YOUR RESIDENT HERE YOU'RE IN THIS SYSTEM IT'S FOR THE BETTERMENT OF THE COMMUNITY IT'S FOR THE BETTER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE OTHER ONE I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO THE CODED RESPONSE- BECAUSE WE ARE OVERLOOKING THIS RIGHT NOW ESSENTIALLY IT'S SOME IT'S HEATING UP WE'RE IN A MASSIVE- MUTUALLY INCIDENT RIGHT NOW IT IT'S. A MEDICAL NATURE AND- I'LL TELL YOU BECAUSE I DID SOME CHECK IS WE'RE ON THE PHONE. I KNEW YESTERDAY I WORK RIGHT SACRAMENTO METROPOLITAN FIRE DEPARTMENT RIGHT THERE IN IN SACRAMENTO. YOU HAD OVER FORTY MEMBERS OUT YESTERDAY AND TODAY WITH COLD THEY WERE CLOSELY RELATED CONTACT RACING WE ARE FORGETTING WHAT WE'RE FACING HERE YOU KNOW THE FIRE SEASON. KNOCK ON WOOD I HOPE THAT WE GET THROUGH THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PART OF THE SEASON. BUT THE COLD THE PIECE OF THIS IS TURNING CRITICAL AGAIN. FOR ALL OF US AND ONE OF THE THINGS AND I'M JUST NEVER GOING TO NOT TAKE THE TIME OR THE ABILITY TO DO THIS. FIREFIGHTERS AND FIREFIGHTER PARAMEDICS WERE NOT CONSIDERED IN THE FIRST YEAR. OF FRONTLINE. WORKERS WE WERE ACTUALLY IN THE SECOND OR THIRD. AND MAYBE EVEN THE FOURTH TIER. AFTER NURSES. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WHEN PEOPLE GET TO THE HOSPITAL. WITH SEVERE SYMPTOMS OF KOBE DIFFERENT TAKES ON YOUR FIREFIGHTERS IN YOUR FIREFIGHTER MEDICS WE NEED TO BE IN THAT FIRST YEAR AND THE OTHER PIECE ON THAT ON THE KOBE ALSO THE- RESPONSE. LEADING PIECE FOR TOO LONG THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE WOULD LOVE TO TALK ABOUT EFFICIENCIES IN THIS IS A BOOTS ON THE GROUND PLEASE- DEFICIENCY USUALLY MEANS THE MINIMUM. NUMBER OF FIREFIGHTERS OR POLICE OFFICERS ON THE SCENE TO HANDLE AN INCIDENT. AND YOU KNOW IN PUBLIC SAFETY IF OUR RESPONSE IS GOING TO BE A MINIMAL RESPONSE. THAT'S THAT IT'S PATHETIC IN THAT IT HAS BECOME THE NORM IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE NATIONAL STANDARD. IT'S FOR PEOPLE ON AN ENGINE COMPANY FOR THE TRUCK IN MOST AREAS AND DID YOU KNOW THAT MOST FIRE DEPARTMENTS IN THE STATE- CAL FORTY WHEN THEY RESPOND. YES CALL WHEN THE STAFF WITH THE STAFF WITH FOR BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT IT'S THE WAY TO GO BUT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE- USING THAT SYSTEM. THE STAFF LAST WEEK THE CITY OF HAVE- THE STAFF THAN THE MOST WITH LESSEN MEMBERS- AT HOME WHETHER IT'S STATUS MONEY TO MAKE MONEY I DON'T KNOW BUT I THINK. THE MITCHELL LAKE SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE AUDITED AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT- YOU KNOW. WE ACTUALLY ACCEPT A MINIMUM OF THREE THAT STANDARD NEEDS TO CHANGE IT NEEDS TO BE FOR PERSON ON ALL YES RESPONSES. AND YOU KNOW WE IN THE FIRE SERVICE YOU KNOW- THE FIRE CHIEF TO MYSELF I WILL DO SAID BELIEVE WE ALL AGREE ON THIS- STAFFING IS CRITICAL STAFFING IS WHAT LETS US DO OUR JOB BETTER TO ACCOMPLISH MORE TASKS TO BE IN A BETTER POSITION TO SAVE LIFE AND PROPERTY INTO MANY TIMES- WE HAVE COME DOWN TO WHAT'S THE MINIMUM STANDARD AND FOR ME AS A LABOR LEADER IN CALIFORNIA IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING- TO SEE THAT IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING TO SEE THE FIREFIGHTERS AND PARAMEDICS ARE PUSHED TO THE FRONT OF CALL THE TESTING HER BORDER. WELL HOPEFULLY THEY'LL BE CONSIDERED IN THE FRONT- FOR VACCINE BECAUSE WE ARE THE ONES THAT TAKE CARE OF OUR FELLOW CITIZENS IN OUR IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND THAT'S WHEN WE NEED TO LOOK AT IN ALL OF THIS RESPONSE WHETHER IT'S WILDFIRE- SINABI MUD SLIDE. THE MINIMUM THAT ARE. THAT'S TO GET THE JOB DONE EVERYTHING ELSE IS VERY HELPFUL WHETHER IT'S- THEIR SUPPORT- BULLDOZERS MECHANICAL BUT IT IS YOU'LL NEVER REPLACE THE MEN AND WOMEN AND WE NEED TO GET OUT OF TE MINDSET. THIS IS WHAT WE CAN USE IT A MINIMUM WE DON'T EVEN HIT THE C. STANDARD WHEN IT COMES TO FIRE RESPONSE PROBABLY IN 90% OF THE STATE. AND- THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S REALLY THE BULLETS THAT I GET ON IT WAS ASKED TO HIT ON I WOULD. CERTAINLY TAKE ANY QUESTIONS EVERYTHING THAT YOU HEARD CHIEF MCLAUGHLIN- CHIEF REVOKES- CHIEF WELCH- CURRY COMMENT. ALL THE THERE ARE NUGGETS OF INFORMATION ON EVERY PIECE OF THIS A REDUNDANT RADIO SYSTEM THAT MAY NOT BE PART OF HER EIGHT HUNDRED SYSTEM IT COULD BE A HIGH FREQUENCY SYSTEM. THAT IS YOU KNOW HAS A DIFFERENT SET OF THE FAIL SAFES WE CAN MAKE OUR COMMUNICATION BETTER. AND I'LL LEAVE YOU WITH THIS- YESS IN CALIFORNIA WE REALLY AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT WE REALLY BEEN LOOKING AT- MODERNIZING. OUR RESPONSE IN OUR MUTUAL AID RESPONSE THIS IS ONE I THINK WE NEED TO DO IN SACRAMENTO YEARS AGO WE DID WHAT WE CALL A BOUNDARY DROP. THERE ARE NO BOUNDARIES FOR FIRE RESPONSE IN IN THE COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO. I LIVE IN THE COUNTY AND I COULD END UP WITH THREE CITY APPARATUS THERE AND ONE METRO FIRE CHIEF WE NEED TO DO THE SAME THING ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE NEED. TO SEND THE QUOTE CLOSEST RESOURCES AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN. AND THEN OUT OF FIVE AFTER THAT IN ONE OF THE WAYS IT IS GOING TO HELP AND I BELIEVE IT WAS- CHIEF WE GO OFTEN BROUGHT THIS UP. THAT AUTOMATIC FUEL BIGELOW CATERS SHOULD BE THE STANDARD ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND SHE THREE BOLTS UP AND- MAMMOTH LAKES SOMEBODY IN THE COMMAND CENTER IN HIS REGION. IF HE'S REPORTING A FIRE THAT HAS THE GROWTH POTENTIAL TWO THOUSAND ACRES IN AN HOUR SOMEBODY NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO TELL HIM CHIEF. WE'VE GOT THIRTY TWO ENGINES WITHIN. SIXTY MILES THERE ALL IN ROUTE TO YOU. IN A MOVE NOT NECESSARILY WE HAVE THAT KEEP. AND WILL NEED TO BE A TO THAT. THE END. THAT WOULD BE. WHAT IT WHAT IT THE BIG POINTS FOR ME. WHICH WE NEED TO DO ABOUT GREEN DROP. AND WE NEED TO SEND THE CLOSEST RESOURCES INITIALLY AND THEN MAKE OUR ADJUSTMENTS AFTER THAT I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE FIRES IN LAKE COUNTY. INDIANA THE BAY AREA I THINK OUR LAG TIME BETWEEN REQUEST. WE GOT THERE WE- EXCUSE ME WAS TOO GREAT AND WE CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE IN THE BAY AREA OR AROUND SACRAMENTO OR THE LA BASIN. WE CAN GET THE RESOURCES THERE QUICKER IN AND THAT'S OUR LIFE'S BLOOD WITH THAT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. AND I HOPE ALL OF YOU HAVE A- GOOD HOLIDAY SEASON AND SENATOR JACKSON YOU WILL BE MISSED. THANK YOU PRESIDENT RICE- OUR LAST PANELISTS IN THE FIRE LAW ENFORCEMENT PANEL- WE HAVE A KORY HONEA. BUTTE COUNTY SHERIFF REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA COUNTY SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION. HIS THE SHERIFF AVAILABLE. OKAY OF THE SHERIFF IS NOT ONLINE- SO WE WILL- YOU KNOW BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO MEMBER QUESTIONS- I JUST WOULD LIKE TO THANK ALL OF THE PANELISTS FOR BRINGING YOUR ON THE GROUND AND LOCAL PERSPECTIVE TO THIS HEARING IT IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK AS LEGISLATORS WE SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE YOUR PERSPECTIVES WHEN WE'RE THINKING ABOUT SOLUTIONS- TO EMERGENCY ALERTS AND IMPROVING- EMERGENCY EVACUATIONS- AS WE HEARD FROM YOU YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE AREAS WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE MANY TYPES OF EMERGENCIES- IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE- ARE. ALWAYS FOCUS ON THE COMMUNITY BE PREPARED TO EVACUATE AND READY TO GO LIKE MANY OF YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR OWN STORIES IN YOUR OWN EXPERIENCES- I AGREE WITH YOU THAT WE NEED TO STOP OPT IN IN- TO THESE ALERTS AND YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA'S AT A DIFFERENT LEVEL NOW IN TERMS OF EMERGENCIES- AND WITH YOU KNOW WITH CLIMATE CHANGE AND EXTREME HEAT OF WE WILL CONTINUE TO PUT OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES- IN THIS ONGOING BATTLE WITH EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT- AND SO. ON YOU BROUGHT UP SOME GREAT TOPICS AND NOW WE'RE READY FOR- QUESTIONS- IS THE SHERIFF AVAILABLE OKAY SO NOW WE DO HAVE THE SHERIFF ONLINE SO I WILL- LET HIM- PRESENT TO US AND THEN WE WILL MOVE TO OUR MEMBER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. SIR SHERIFF THANK. THANK YOU VENTURA COLLEGE EYES I WAS HAVING MY COMPUTER FROZE UP ON ME- THE WORLD WE LIVE IN TODAY IS A PRONE TO THAT KIND OF THING SO I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO. ADDRESS THIS COMMITTEE- WELL I HAVE LISTENED TO THE ENTIRE. HEARING  ECHO MANY OF THE COMMENTS MY COLLEAGUES MAY KNOW SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I WOULD SAY- WILL SOMBER FAMILIAR TO YOU I THINK THAT THEY'RE WORTHY OF EMPHASIZING AND SO IN PARTICULAR I'M GONNA EMPHASIZE SOME OF THINGS THAT CHIEF WELCH SAID AS WELL AS SOME THINGS THAT PRESIDENT ARE RISING SENT. ALERT AND WARNING AND EVACUATION COORDINATION IS A VERY VERY COMPLEX OPERATION IT IS SOMETHING THAT I'VE HAD A GOOD EXPERIENCE WITH- AS THE SHERIFF OF THE COUNTY HAVING SUFFERED. THROUGH A NUMBER OF MAJOR DISASTERS AND- AS A MEMBER OF THE SICILIAN AND REPRESENTS AS A CITY TODAY. I'VE HAVE YET TO SPEAK WITH MY COLLEAGUES ROTH STATE YOU. GET THEIR PERSPECTIVE ON THESE KINDS OF THINGS AS WELL- WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT. THE COMPLEXITY THAT WE DEAL WITH WHEN IT COMES TO ALERT AND WARNING IS REALLY NOT UNDERSTOOD. BY MANY MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY IT'S OFTEN NOT UNDERSTOOD BY THE PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF. THE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT ROUND YEAH I THINK THAT LENDS TO. INCREASE DIFFICULTY IN TERMS OF GETTING PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THEIR PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY. EVEN BEFORE THE ALERT AND WARNING- IS REQUIRED. THE FACT MATTERS THIS IF WE'RE AT A POINT WHERE WE HAVE TO ISSUE AN ALERT AND WARNING BECAUSE OF OPINION A DISASTER HAZARD OR CRISIS. WELL WE ARE ALREADY BEHIND THE CURVE IF YOU WILL. BUT THE FACT IS UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES NO MATTER WHAT KIND OF PREPARATION WE HAVE DONE AHEAD OF TIME WHAT KIND OF SYSTEMS WE HAVE IN PLACE WITH REGARD TO ALERT AND WARNING. THERE IS NO WAY TO GUARANTEE 1100% SATURATION OF YOUR MESSAGE AND THERE'S NO WAY TO GUARANTEE THAT PEOPLE WILL DO WHAT YOU ASK THEM TO DO. AND SO TO EXPECT A PERFECT OUTCOME. IS IN MY VIEW- PROBABLY- AN EXPECTATION THAT ISN'T REALISTIC SO THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO FOCUS ON THE FRONT END OF PREVENTION AND- INSURING THAT WE'RE A BETTER POSITION TO PREVENT THESE KINDS OF. INCIDENTS IN CRISIS TO FROM CURRENT FIRST PLACE OR THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO BE CONTROLLED. MUCH MUCH QUICKER IN IN IN A BETTER FASHION. AND THAT REQUIRES A LEVEL OF PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY ON THE PART OF MEMBERS MARCH MEDIAN THAT'S SOMETHING THAT SEEMS TO BE LOST IN A LOT OF THESE DISCUSSIONS IS. ALWAYS ABOUT WHAT IS- YES DOING WORK FOR THE COUNTY IS DOING WHAT IS LAW ENFORCEMENT AND WHAT AS FAR DOING. BUT PART OF THIS EQUATION IS WHAT ARE THE MEMBERS OF YOUR COMMUNITY DOING TO. BE PREPARED AND TO BE TUNED IN TO WHAT'S GOING ON IF YOU WILLING TO. DO WHAT THEY'RE BEING ASKED TO DO BY THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE BEST UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE THREAT YES. I'LL REITERATE SHORT. WHAT OF WHAT THAT'LL- IS JUST BECAUSE I THINK SUPPORT FOR YOUR STAND THAT. IS YOU HEARD FROM CHIEF WELCH THE FIRST AND FOREMOST IS THAT. WE HAVE TO COME TO KNOW ABOUT THE THREAT AND THAT REQUIRES US TO BUT IN IN IN IN BOTH FIRES FAR SIDE AS WELL AS LONG FOR SOCIETY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE THREAT IS. FIRE OR FLOOD OR POTENTIAL OF. REACH A DAM OR TSUNAMI OR TORNADO OR WHATEVER THAT WHATEVER THE SITUATION WE MIGHT BEGIN WITH THERE'S THIS PERIOD OF TIME WHERE YOU HAVE TO. COME TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE THREAT IS AND THEN WHAT THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSES AND THAT TAKES TIME. BEYOND THAT THERE IS THE COORDINATION BETWEEN THE VARIOUS A PUBLIC SAFETY CEASEFIRE LAW AND MEDICAL AS WELL AS THE EXTENDED- COUNTY RESPONSE WHICH INCLUDES. SETTING UP SHELTERS AND DEALING WITH. IT EVACUEES AND ALL OF THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THAT COME. TO ISSUE THE WARNING THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME COORDINATION- IN THE EARLY STAGES OF THAT AND THEN FROM THE STANDPOINT OF DEVELOPING A CLEAR MESSAGE AS TO WHAT THE THREAT IS. HONESTLY BOOKS. THAT IS EASIER SAID THAN DONE SOMETIMES WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO CONVEY. WHAT THE THREAT IS AND WHAT THE RESPONSE SHOULD BE IN THE LIMITATIONS THAT ACROSS BY THE VERY SYSTEMS THAT WE USE TO COMMUNICATE THAT IT ISN'T ALWAYS AS EASY OR AS QUICK AS YOU WORK AS ONE MIGHT THINK NOW WE'VE DONE SOME THINGS LOCALLY TO TRY TO. SHORTEN THAT WINDOW OF A TIME WE CAN'T MESSAGES THAT WE CAN USE AND MODIFY AND ALTER BUT ULTIMATELY EVERY SINGLE. THREAT COMES WITH DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS DIFFERENT VARIABLES THAT HAVE TO BE COMMUNICATED AND AGAIN PUTTING THAT IN A SUCCINCT MESSAGE THAT. THE VAST MAJORITY PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND AND THEN ADVISING THEM WHAT THE RESPONSES IN THE VERY VERY CHALLENGING. NOW YOU HEARD ABOUT HOW POOR IT IS WITH MESSAGE ACROSS MULTIPLE PLATFORMS THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT NO ONE LISTENS. NO ONE LISTENS TO A SINGLE SOURCE. EVERYBODY IS TUNED INTO VARIOUS. FORMS OF COMMUNICATION I WILL TELL YOU THAT THERE HAS BEEN A MOVEMENT A DEPENDENCY UPON CELLPHONES. WELL THAT I ITS CONCERNS ABOUT BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY I THINK. NOT ONLY DOES THE GOVERNMENT BUT DID THE PUBLIC ALSO BECOMES OVER RELIANT UPON RECEIVING INFORMATION FROM THEIR CELL PHONES AND WE'VE SEEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN. BUT THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK THE SYSTEMS GO DOWN BUT IT BECOME OVERLOADED AND WE LOSE OUR ABILITY COMMUNICATE. BUT ULTIMATELY YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO PUSH YOUR MESSAGE ACROSS MULTIPLE PLATFORMS IT AFTER TO GET MAXIMUM DISTRIBUTION. THAT INCLUDES. THE ALERT AND WARNING SYSTEMS THAT MANY COUNTIES HAVE THEIR DIFFERENT VENDORS THAT PROVIDE THAT IT. MAYBE IT'S WORTH WHILE TALKING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT. THERE SHOULD BE A STATE WIDE OUR SYSTEM SO THERE'S A CONTINUITY THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE. BUT IT'S THROUGH THOSE SYSTEMS THAT WE ALL ACCESS I POINTS WHICH IS THE- ALERT AND WARNING SYSTEM- THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THE WIRELESS ALERT SYSTEM ANY MERCY. ALERT SYSTEM. OUR GRASS. MESSAGES THAT MOVE. THROUGH THOSE PLATFORMS BUT HAS EXPECTATIONS THERE ARE CHARACTER LIMITATIONS THAT- CREATE A PROBLEM FOR US IN TERMS OF AGAIN ARTICULATED WITH THE THREAT IS AND ADVISING WHAT THE RESPONSE SHOULD BE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT IN ADDITION TO UTILIZING THE MERCY NOTIFICATION SYSTEMS WHICH AS YOU POINTED OUT ARE OFTEN. OF ACCESSING HIGH COSTS WHICH- ARE NOT ADOPTED SYSTEM BUT WE CAN PUSH THAT OUT THROUGH THE- WE ARE IN THE A. F. SYSTEM. BUT AS I SAID THERE ARE LIMITATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH ALL THAT. WE FOUND WE NEED TO SET UP CALL CENTRES. IN CONJUNCTION WITH PUSHING MESSAGES OUT THROUGH I PAUSE AND WE HAVE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS WHERE PEOPLE ARE BECAUSE EITHER THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS PUT OUT OR WE WORRY WILL PROVIDE ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED GIVEN THE LIMITATIONS- IN THE FORMAT OR LIMITATIONS IN IN THE- IN THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WE'RE USING. YEAH THAT IS ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE HAVE TO HELP MITIGATE THE BURDEN UPON OUR NINE ONE ONE DISPATCHERS. WELL THERE'S BEEN SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT THE USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA AND TRADITIONAL MEDIA I'LL TALK ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA REAL QUICKLY THE FACT IS IT IS PART OF OUR LANDSCAPE IS PART OF OUR ENVIRONMENT. BUT YOU HAVE TO MESSAGE ON SOCIAL MEDIA BOTH FACEBOOK AND TWITTER AND NOW INSTAGRAM SOME THOSE OTHERS. IF YOU DON'T PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY WILL TAKE IT UPON THEMSELVES TO TAKE YOUR MESSAGE AND IN SOME CASES THEY DON'T TAKE IT ACCURATELY AND THEY BEGIN TO PUSH IT OUT SO YOU HAVE TO OPERATE WITHIN THAT ENVIRONMENT AS WELL. BUT THAT APARTMENT IS OF COURSE PRONE TO A LOT OF A RUMOR A LOT OF MISINFORMATION AND ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. YOU HAVE TO WORK TO COMBAT THE- BUTTE COUNTY WE'VE UP. THE SIMPSONS RADIO. UTILIZING HIM. AGREED YOU ARE. IN EFFORT TO. BROADEN OURS. IN OUR REGION- AND I'LL TALK TO ABOUT WHY THAT'S IMPORTANT RURAL AREAS. AND THEN OF COURSE- WE UTILIZE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TO GO IN THE IMPACT THERE IS. AFTER THE OROVILLE DAM SPILLWAY INCIDENT OF THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS CAME TO BE COUNTY. AND TALKED ABOUT THE BACK WHICH THEY DID ONE OF THE THINGS THEY- ARE POINTED OUT SOME SOME STUDIES THEY HAVE DONE IS THAT THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY. TO GET PEOPLE TO EVACUATE. THIS FOR A LONG FORCING OFFICER IN UNIFORM TO GO TO THEIR DOOR. TELL THEM OF THE THREAT AND TELL THEM WHAT THE RESPONSE. YOU'RE MORE APT TO GET THEM TO DO WHAT YOU NEED YOU ARE THE CIRCUMSTANCES. BUT THE FACT THE MATTER IS. THAT'S NOT PRACTICAL ESPECIALLY IN THESE. RAPIDLY EVOLVING SITUATIONS LIKE THE COUNSELOR ON PRESIDENT OF RICE MADE THIS COMMENT IN FACT IS I MADE THIS CALM AS WELL DURING THE CAMPFIRE THERE WERE NOT ENOUGH FIRE ENGINES AND THERE WERE NOT ENOUGH **** IN A PROBABLY THE STATE CALIFORNIA TO PREVENT THAT FIRE FROM MOVING THROUGH AND FOR US TO GET TO EVERY SINGLE. HOUSE AND NOTIFY PEOPLE WHAT WAS GOING ON AND THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE ARE FACING HERE IN CALIFORNIA. BUT TO MITIGATE. B. FACT THAT THERE'S NO WAY FOR US TO GO DOOR TO DOOR KNOCK IN A RUN STORE. A WE IMPLEMENTED THE HIGH LOW SIREN AS MUCH AS YOU CAME THROUGH- THIS YEAR. AUTHORIZED LAW ENFORCEMENT YOU THAT I THINK THAT'S A- A GREAT PROGRAM THAT WE CAN ALSO BUILD ON- YOU THAT BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO STAND. HOW MUCH EFFORT GOES INTO ALERTING PEOPLE AND NOTIFY THEM. OF WHAT THE THREAT IS. AND THEN FROM THERE EVACUATING NOW TRYING TO GET THEM THERE AND THAT BRINGS WITH IT A WHOLE HOST OF COMPLEXITY- FIRST OFF YOU HAVE TO HELP. LOCATIONS FOR PEOPLE TO GO YOU HAVE TO RESOURCE FOR THEM WHEN THEY GET THERE. AND WHAT I FIND IS THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFTENTIMES. ARE REQUIRED TO SPEND. MORE TIME ASSISTING PEOPLE WITH ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS. AS WELL AS PEOPLE WITH ANIMALS. ANIMALS BECOME A VERY VERY PROBLEMATIC SITUATION FORCE OFTENTIMES PEOPLE WILL NOT THAT EVACATE. THEIR HOME IF THEY DON'T HAVE A WAY TO TAKE. A PATH. AND SO- THIS IDEA OR NOTION OF BEING ABLE TO GO DOOR TO DOOR AND NOTIFY EVERYBODY IS FURTHER EXACERBATED BY THE FACT THAT WE NEED TO SPEND OUR TIME. ASSISTING THOSE INDIVIDUALS AGAIN WOULD ASK IS IMPARTIAL NEEDS ASSISTING THOSE INDIVIDUAL ANIMALS SO THEY CAN ULTIMATELY- GET OUT OF THAT AREA WAS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. BUT THE ONE VARIABLE HERE THAT IS SO DIFFICULT TO CONTROL. OR PEOPLE. IN THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THIS. MANY PEOPLE NO THE THREAT IS COMING. THEY ARE CURRENT EITHER THROUGH AN OFFICIAL SOURCE OR THROUGH A RELIABLE SOURCE OF THAT THE THREAT IS COMING BUT THEY CHOOSE NOT TO FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS WE CHOOSE NOT TO HEED THE ADVICE I CAN'T TELL YOU. THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT I. BIRD TELL ME VERY A HARROWING STORIES ABOUT ESCAPING THE FLAMES AND CAMPFIRE AND THEN MOST RECENTLY HERE IN INDICATING THE VERIFIER- ALL OF THAT BEGIN WITH WELL WE WEREN'T SURE IF WE SHOULD EVACUATE WE WANTED TO WAIT TO SEE IF THE FIRE WAS COMING- WE ARE ULTIMATELY DID EVACUATE UNTIL WE SAW THE FLAMES AND- FRANKLY UP BY THAT POINT IT'S TOO LATE. AND REGRETTABLY A NUMBER OF PEOPLE PERISHED IN THAT FIRE FAMILY MEMBERS TOLD US THE SAME KIND OF THING DEBATE THE NEW THE THREAT WAS COMING BUT THEY CHOSE NOT TO EVACUATE. ON FOR NUMBER OF REASONS. ALL OFTENTIMES WILL NOT DO NOT WANT TO LEAVE THEIR% HOME. AND IT BECOMES A VERY VERY DIFFICULT PROPOSITION FOR US DEAL. NOW THERE WAS THERE WAS A- SOME SOME COMMENTS EARLY- OR WHAT JOBS EMAILED ME WITH REGARD TO THAT AND THE FACT MATTERS I DON'T THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE GONNA CHANGE THAT FOLKS. ON YOU. YOU CAN ISSUE AN ORDER. AS A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. IF A PERSON REFUSES TO OBEY THE ORDER IN ONE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE YOU BELIEVE THE VIOLATION OF THE LAW IT'S A MISDEMEANOR CRIME BUT IN A PRACTICAL SENSE YOU CAN'T GO ABOUT ARRESTING PEOPLE IN TRANSPORTING THEM TO JAIL BECAUSE THEY REFUSED TO LEAVE COLLEGE OPTICAL SERVICES TO GET THEIR KIDS CALLING ANIMAL CONTROL TO GET THEIR OWN BECAUSE- WHILE YOU'RE DOING THAT. YOU'RE MISSING OUT ON THE OPPORTUNITY TO ALERT AND HELP EVACUATE MANY OTHER PEOPLE I DON'T THINK THAT'S ULTIMATELY THE ANSWER THE QUESTION. WHAT I DO THINK IS A BETTER USE OF OUR TIME AND RESOURCES IS ONE. WE NEED TO REALLY INVEST IN PREVENTING THESE THINGS FROM OCCURRING IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND THAT MEANS- DEALING WITH UN. THE FUEL LOADS THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH IN IN. THE RURAL AREAS AND THE FIRES MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS A ROBUST ROBUST A CHAMP PAYNE A TO GET PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE. OF PREPARING HAVE YOUR PLAN IN PLACE TUNING IN TO THE VARIOUS METHODS IN WHICH WE COMMUNICATE AND BE READY TO GO AND GOING HOME WE ASK THEM TO I THINK ULTIMATELY GAINING THAT KIND OF COMPLIANCE FOR MANY FROM OUT IN FIRST PLACE AGAIN THAT COMPLIANCE IS GOING TO BE A MUCH MUCH BETTER A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM. THE LAST THING THAT I WANT TO JUST BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING THAT. I BECAME MORE AND MORE FAMILIAR WITH IN THE LAST PART OF THE BILL THAT AND THAT IS THE IMPACT OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS ON SOME OF OUR VERY RURAL COMMUNITY. NOW THERE'S BEEN SOME TALK ABOUT THE NEED TO HAVE A SEVENTY TWO HOUR- GENERATORS ARE BACKUP GENERATORS WERE CELL SITES AND THAT'S GREAT AS LONG AS YOU'VE GOT CELL SERVICE. BUT THERE ARE PARTS OF CALIFORNIA. IN AND RUN REMOTE CAL. WHERE THEY HAVE CELLS. AND SO WHAT THEY RELY UPON. IS CONNECTING THEIR CELL PHONE TO THEIR INTERNET PROVIDER IN UTILIZING THEIR INTERNET PROVIDER OR VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL PHONE SERVICE TO HAVE COMMUNICATION WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD. ONCE THE POWER IS TURNED OFF THEY LOSE THE INTERNET CONNECTIVITY AND AS SUCH THEY LOSE THAT CELLPHONE AND THAT VOICE OR IN A PROTOCOL FONG AND AS YOU KNOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ARE STARTING TO GO AWAY FROM LANDLINE PHONES AND SO IN THOSE CASES- SOMETIMES THE ONLY THING YOU HAVE LEFT. IS THE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE THAT WRAPS YOU'RE ONE OF THE OTHER- MECHANISMS OFFERED BY I PAUSE THE MERCY ALERT SYSTEM WE HAVE SOME RADIO OUR SYSTEM AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE. A STATE WIDE. PLAN AROUND- GETTING PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT. THEY HAVE A- RESPONSE. THEY HAVE TO TAKE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEMSELVES FOR THEIR LOVED ONES FOR THEIR NEIGHBORS AS A GROUP BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T HAVE A PLAN IN PLACE IF THEY DON'T TAKE THAT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY IF THEY'RE JUST WAITING FOR THEIR LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO TELL THEM WHEN AND WHERE AND WHAT TO DO AND THEN THEY'LL MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE GOING TO. LISTEN TO BE LOCAL EMERGENCY PERSONNEL THE FACT IS TO IT. WE REALLY HAVE TO IT HAS TO BE PART OF THE OVERALL EQUATION AND IF IT'S NOT I JUST DON'T KNOW THAT WE'RE GONNA BUILD A GUARANTEE- SIGNIFICANT OVERWHELMING SUCCESS ACROSS THE BOARD IT TAKES THE PUBLIC TO BE PART OF THIS EQUATION AND NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF PREPAREDNESS BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF PREVENTION AND WITH THAT I'LL CONCLUDE MY COMMENTS AND ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SHARE. I SO NOW WE WILL MOVE ON- TWO QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE I WANT TO START WITH. A QUESTION FROM SENATOR JACKSON. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH WAS A VERY INTERESTING PANEL AND I WANT TO SAY IT'S A- PLEASURE AND A PRIVILEGE TO WORK WITH SO MANY OF YOU OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS BRIAN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR GREAT EFFORT AND- IT'S VERY INTERESTING TO ME TO HEAR THE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES HERE WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MORE RURAL AREAS WHERE THERE ARE CERTAINLY REAL CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH JUST SIMPLE ACCESS TO. TO THE WARNING SYSTEMS THAT EXIST IN SOME CERTAIN THINGS- BUT BUT I THINK- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT REDUNDANCY I THINK THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY NEED TO HAVE AVAILABLE TO US ALL. OF THE TECHNOLOGIES AND I CAN TELL YOU ARE SURE PHONE A- I HAD MORE THAN ONE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER KNOCK AT MY BACK DOOR AND TELL ME IT WAS TIME TO GO- IN PART BECAUSE THE A LARGE DON'T WORKABLE. ARE IT'S UNCLEARWHAT THEY WHO THEY'RE TELLING TO EVACUATE WHAT THE CHALLENGES ARE SO- AND I'M NOT QUITE THAT SAME RURAL AREA I'M IN A SORT OF A- MOVIE BUT NOT QUITE OUT THERE IN THE- EXTREMES. SO I APPRECIATE ALL YOU DO AND I REALLY DO- I THINK WE OWE YOU ALL A DEBT OF GRATITUDE THERE ARE SO MANY. QUESTIONS I HAVE I'M GONNA TRY TO NARROW IT DOWN JUST TO A COUPLE- IN FOCUS ON. SOME OF THE LEGISLATION THAT I'VE DONE YOU YOU'VE ALL MENTIONED SOME OF THESE AREAS FROM PREVENTION AND THINNING OF- YOU KNOW WE I I'VE DONE LEGISLATION ON CONTROLLED BURNS SO THAT WE CAN DO MORE OF THAT WE BRING IN CALLAWAY YES AND THE FIRE- AGENCIES AND AIR POLLUTION CONTROL PEOPLE. AND I THINK WE'VE REALLY CREATED A GOOD SYSTEM- I WON'T BE HERE TO IMPROVE UPON IT I'M SURE THERE IS A LOT TO IMPROVE UPON AND I WANT TO INVITE YOU ALL TO WORK WITH. MY COLLEAGUES WHO. SHARE THIS AREA OF CONCERN. IT WHEN AND IF YOU IDENTIFY PLACES WHERE MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO DO A BETTERJOB I DO A LOT OF WHAT WE'VE DONE IS SORT OF AN INITIAL START WHEN IT COMES TO WILDFIRES- BUT- I'M- I'M ALSO CONCERNED THE DISCUSSION ABOUT WE SHOULDN'T HAVE AN OPT IN AND OPT OUT WE SHOULD JUST DO IT- AND- NOT THAT I DISAGREE- BUT- I THINK THAT WE DO HAVE TO BE REALISTIC THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT JUST DON'T. WANT US TELLING THEM WHAT TO DO. AND THEY'RE NOT GONNA LEAVE NO MATTER WHAT WE TELL THEM- AND THAT'S JUST A FACT- BUT I DO DO LEGISLATION THAT REQUIRES OR I SHOULD SAY THAT ENCOURAGED RISKY UNIVERSITIES. TO CREATE AN OPT OUT SYSTEM. THAT MEANS THAT MOST PEOPLE. WILL BE IN THE SYSTEM DOWN GET NOTIFIED. THEY'LL BE. AND HOW. THEY'LL MAKE. THE BEST DECISION FOR THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES. BUT MY CONCERN IS THAT WE ARE NOT SEEING- COMMUNITIES A- COUNTIES REALLY. PROMOTING THIS PROCESS OF IT IS THAT WE LEFT IT UP TO EVERY COUNTY BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT WHILE THERE IS A LOT WE CAN DO STATEWIDE IMPACT PROBABLY SHOULD BE DOING MORE. OUT WE DO NEED TO RECOGNIZE EVERY COUNTY HAS ITS DIFFERENT- ISSUES CONCERNS GEOGRAPHY EXPERIENCE WHATEVER. AND THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE IN PORT AS WELL FROM FROM THOSE AREAS SKINNER WE HAVE DIFFERENT- FIRED WE HAVE FOUR SHOP IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE- WE HAVE DIFFERENT- YOU KNOW. TYPES OF FUELS IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE AND I HAVE TO ADDRESS THEM DIFFERENTLY THERE IS NO ONE SIZE FITS ALL. BUT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO SHARE WITH ME- AND WHOEVER WANTS TO TRY TO ANSWER THIS. WHY WE AREN'T GETTING GREATER PARTICIPATION IN OUR OPT OUT NOTIFICATION PROGRAMS- THIS CONCERNS ME BECAUSE- YOU GOT TO HAVE THAT INFORMATION AND- I WE HAVE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MECHANISMS- SOMEBODY HAD MENTIONED LIKE WE HAD THE OLD CONRAD SYSTEM FOR ANY OF YOU OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER- THAT CRISIS BACK WHEN WE THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO BE IN A NUCLEAR. GOD HELP US- THE NUCLEAR DISASTER WE HAD THIS WARNING SYSTEM WE DON'T HAVE IT ANYMORE- WE USED TO BACK IN THE OLD DAYS HAVE THECHURCH BELLS WE DON'T HAVE THOSE EITHER. SO BUT WE DO HAVE TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE SOME EXTRAORDINARY POSSIBILITIES WHY ARE WE NOT. SEEING IT BEING USED MORE. THANK YOU. BRING RACE. JUST I THINK ON MY END. GET IT LIVING IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY- I'M GOING BACK IN MY MEMORY YOU CAN EVEN TRYING TO REMEMBER- THE LAST TIME THE COUNTY MAY HAVE PUT A NOTICE ON TWITTER IS THAT YOU SEE ON TELEVISION OR RADIO ON SOCIAL MEDIA ABOUT THE SYSTEM AND- JOINING IN I THINK I THINK PART OF IT IS SAFE ANY THINK WE DO IF WHAT IS AFTER COMMUNICATION WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE ENTIRE EVENT AND IF WE DON'T YEAH THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS THAT WOULD BE KIND OF ONE OF MY- MY BIGGEST ONE I DON'T THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE COUNTIES ARE REALLY AWARE AND IT'S PROBABLY- AS- AS A- A COUNTY RESIDENT WE COULD PROBABLY DO BETTER. FOR AT LEAST MAYBE ONCE OR TWICE A YEAR TO RENEW THAT WITH THE RESIDENTS THAT HEY THIS IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION. TO LIVE IN COUPLES YEAH. I COULD NOT DO THAT COM SO. WE ARE EXPERIENCING THE ACCOUNTING HAS. IT REALLY BEGAN YOUR BILL DANCE INSTEAD WHEN WE- ADOPTED THE USE OF A MERCY MASTERPIECES CALLED COBRA THERE OTHER VENDORS OUT THERE I'M NOT AND I'M NOT SAYING ONE IS BETTER THE OTHER BUT THAT'S WHAT WE WILL. BE COUNTY AND IN THAT REGARD OTHER FEATURES OF IT THAT ARE OFTEN. IF WE UTILIZE THE I BECAUSE OF COURSE WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT WE CAN DO THAT BUT WE'RE LIMITED TERMS DROP. LIKE WHAT WE FOUND IS YOU AFTER. ON THE- TRYING TO GET THE WORD OUT THROUGH VARIOUS MECHANISMS SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGNS ARE. GOING ON LOCAL NEWS STATIONS TALKING THE LOCAL NEWSPAPERS ON. THE PEOPLE IN THEIR DAILY LIVES JUST DON'T LIKE TO THINK ABOUT. DID YOU CRISIS THEY DON'T LIKE TO THINK ABOUT A POTENTIAL CATASTROPHE AND SO OUR EFFORT TO GET PEOPLE TO SIGN UP DESPITE OUR PUBLIC RELATIONS CAMPAIGN. WAS MOM- MEDIOCRE AT BEST UNTIL. A CRISIS HAPPENS AND WHAT WE FIND IS THAT. IN THE- WHEN THE FIRE IS BEARING DOWN UPON PEOPLE WHEN THE WHEN THERE'S THE POTENTIAL FOR THE DAM BEEN EVERYBODY STARTS PAYING ATTENTION AND THAT'S WHEN WE HAD SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF PEOPLE ULTIMATELY SIGNED UP. THERE HAD TO BE THAT REP MOONEY FOR THEM TO BE MOTIVATED ENOUGH TO GO ON AND SIGN UP FOR THE ALERTS. BUT THAT'S ANOTHER REASON WE ALTERNATELY REALIZE WE HAD A MESSAGE ACROSS MULTIPLE PLATFORMS IS A BIT ALSO REFER CODE RED PERHAPS WE CAN GET HIM THROUGH FACEBOOK TWITTER SIGN. INFORMATION CENTER OF THAT'S I DO THE LEDGE. I DID THE CREATES AN OP OUT SO THAT EVERYBODY GETS PUT IN THE SYSTEM AUTOMATICALLY YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET THEIR PERMISSION- BUT THEY DO HAVE THE RIGHT IF THEY DON'T WANT TO PARTICIPATE THEY CAN OPT OUT- YOU KNOW THIS IS THE WAY THAT- ALL OF THE- PLATFORMS ON THE INTERNET. YOU'RE IN THE SYSTEM UNLESS YOU% SAY NO I DON'T WANT TO BE- I THOUGHT THAT HEY WE'VE GOT A PROCESS HERE WHERE WE CAN KEEP PEOPLE SAFE. I CREATING AN OPT OUT SYSTEM BUT I BELIEVE I HEARD THAT ONLY TWENTY EIGHT COUNTIES ARE REALLY ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN THAT- AND I'M JUST WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET IS A SENSE OF WHY WE ARE HAVING SUCH DIFFICULTY WITH THIS OPT OUT PROGRAM WHERE. LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN AND IS ABLE TO REACH OUT TO VARIOUS- PROVIDERS TO GET THE INFORMATION PUT IT IN THEIR SYSTEM SO THAT WHEN THERE IS AN EMERGENCY. THAT GOES OUT TO THE COMMUNITY- THEY THEY HAVEN'T OPTED IN THEY HAVEN'T HAD TO OFTEN THEY HAVE AN AT THE THINK ABOUT IT. IT'S THERE THAT'S THE REASON WE TRIED AN OPT OUT AND YET I'M CONCERNED THAT IT DOESN'T SEEM. TO BE HAVING THE EFFECT THAT WE WERE HOPING WHICH IS THAT EVERYONE WE GET NOTIFIED BECAUSE WHEN THERE IS AN EMERGENCY. THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT. I UNDERSTAND A NUMBER GONNA BRING YOU IN TERMS OF LEGISLATION ALSO MADE I THINK WAS THAT THAT'S A GOOD APPROACH NOW. RECOGNIZE THAT NOT EVERY COUNTY NOT EVERY COUNTY. HAS THE SAME RESOURCES AND CAPACITY TO. BRING SYSTEMS ON SO THAT MIGHT ACCOUNT FOR. WHY THERE'S BEEN A LACK ULTIMATELY NOT BUT IT ALSO BRINGS ME TO ANOTHER POINT WHICH I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT IS. THERE IS AN OVER RELIANCE UPON TECHNOLOGY ESPECIALLY CELL PHONES. AND IF THE MAJORITY OF OUR EFFORTS TO COMMUNICATE THROUGH A CELL PHONE PEOPLE I HAVE CONCERNS BECAUSE I'VE SEEN THE NETWORKS GO DOWN OR THE NETWORKS GET JAMMED WITH TRAFFIC DURING THESE A MAJOR. EVENTS AND- ALTERNATELY THE CELLPHONE DOESN'T BECOME A RELIABLE SOURCE IN THE MIDST OF ALL THIS AND THAT'S WHY THE NEED FOR- MESSAGING ACROSS MULTIPLE PLATFORMS AND IT COMES BACK YOU'VE GOT TO BE TO GET OUT LEVEL PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY IN ALL OF THIS TO ENSURE THE YOU'RE TUNED INTO DIFFERENT ASPECTS BUT ALSO- YOU'RE WILLING TO DO WHAT. NEEDS TO BE DONE KEEPS. THANK YOU IT WAS ELSE DID ANYONE FACT FINANCE I FOR ME ON THE- OKAY I HAVE ONE LAST QUESTION. AND IT HAS TO DEAL WITH I DON'T RECALL WHICH REVIEW OF FOLKS MENTIONED IT. BUT CREATE WE DO HAVE NETWORKS NOW- AND I THINK IT PERHAPS IT WAS. BRIAN WHO MENTIONED THAT THAT YOU HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE WHOLE PROCESS OF DISSEMINATING PPVS. DURING COVERT WE ARE ABOUT TO HAVE A VACCINE. I AM ONE OF THE BIG CHALLENGES IS GOING TO BE HOW DO WE DISPENSE AND QUICKLY ENOUGH AND EFFECTIVELY ENOUGH I'M WONDERING IF- YOU FOLKS AND I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH- WE ANSWER ANY FOR ANY GROUPS TO TRY TO BECOME THAT AYE WHAT WHAT MAY BE SORT OF THE LOGICAL NETWORK. TO BE GAINED HAD DISTRIBUTION PROCESS SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE. EVERYONE I CAN GET THAT VACCINE OF COURSE I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO DO IT IN DIFFERENT LEVELS ARE FIRST RESPONDERS AND OUR- MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND SO FORTH BUT ARE YOU PART OF THE EFFORT- TO CREATE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S GOING TO GET THAT VACCINE OUT AS QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE. SHOULD YOU BE ARE AND WHAT IS BEING DONE TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN IF YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THAT GIVEN THE WORK ALREADY BEEN DOING ON PPC SO FORTH AND JUST. YOU KNOW IN GENERAL. THE WORK THAT YOU DO% WITH THEM- USE AND FIGHTING FIRES AND DISASTERS AS YOU DO. YOU SENATOR JACK. IN INTERNET. MAKE EASIER THE SIMPLE ANSWER IS DO I BELIEVE WE SHOULD BE A PART OF IT YES- THAT'S THE EASY SIMPLE ANSWER- WE STARTED HAVE STARTED DOWN A PATHWAY- THE COMMUNITY PARAMEDICINE IN AB WORK LIST SECRETARY- DOCTOR GALLEY AND- DICK DUNCAN ANSWERED DIRECTOR I THINK THAT I'M PERMITS AND FIREFIGHTER PARAMEDIC SHOULD BE PART OF THAT DISCUSSION ON THE COMMUNITY DELIVERY- I DON'T KNOW THE LEVEL IN THE GAPS THAT THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING BUT I DO KNOW THAT MANY DEPARTMENTS- IN CALIFORNIA'S METRO FIRE IS AN EXAMPLE- TESTING UNIT IN SERVICE. AND THE MOBILE TESTING THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY SO I CREEK THAT. IF THAT WAS CASH AND IS NOT BEING AT THAT LEVEL IT REALLY NEEDS TO BE BECAUSE THE FIRE DEPARTMENT- WE'RE LOCATED IN ALMOST EVERY SINGLE COMMUNITY AND IF YOU'RE IN SACRAMENTO. RIGHT IN A FIRE STATION A FIRE ENGINE CAN GET TO YOUR HOME AND IN FIVE MINUTES OR LESS I THINK THAT WERE ONE OF THE VEHICLES ALONG WITH THE NATIONAL GUARD AND SOME OF THE OTHER- LARGE SCALE. YOU KNOW THAT EVEN AGAINST THE LOGISTICS OF IT. IN THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES WE SHOULD BE A PART OF THAT AND YOU KNOW THAT WOULD DEFINITELY BE A DISCUSSION WITH NOT ONLY THE GOVERNOR AND- YES BUT- DR MARK GALLI YEAH ARE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY. THANK YOU THANK YOU TO THE OTHER GENTLEMAN- CHIEF WELCH- TO ACHIEVE FREE LONDON AND- SURE PHONY YOU DO AGREE I MEAN ARE YOU. ARE YOU- SET UP TO DO THIS ARE YOU READY TO GO SHOULD THE GOVERNOR BE LOOKING YOU SHOULD ALWAYS YES BE LOOKING TO YOU SHOULD WE BE LOOKING TO YOU- TO DO THIS I MEAN WE- THIS IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING WE ALL WANT TO GET OUT OF OUR HOMES AND- I WANT TO SEE MY GRANDKIDS AND I BET EVERYBODY HAS THE THINGS THEY WANT TO DO. YOU KNOW I'M NOT GETTING ANY YOUNGER AND THEY'RE GROWING UP WITHOUT ME AND I DON'T WANT THAT. AND I SUSPECT WE ALL HAVE SIMILAR FEELINGS WELL SOME PEOPLE WITH A DESPERATE TO GET THEIR KIDS BACK TO SCHOOL WE WANT TO GET THROUGH THIS THING AND IF INDEED WE HAVE THAT VACCINE WE'VE GOT TO DISTRIBUTE IT ARE YOU. THE PLACE WE SHOULD BE GOING TO HELP DISTRIBUTE. SENATOR THIS IS CHEAPER WALTER IT'S AN ACTUAL AND FOR QUESTION. V. ALL REFERENCE WHAT HE SAID- EARLIER ABOUT THE- SHASTA EMERGENCY CENTER- AT. THE CITY LEVEL COUNTY OR I'M I CAN'T SPEAK OBVIOUSLY EACH OF ARE ALL BUT WE DIFFERENTLY BUT ESSENTIALLY WE'RE SUPPORTING. OUR PUBLIC HEALTH MISSION- I WOULD SAY SOMETHING UNIQUE ABOUT THIS INSTANCE THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE SET UP AN OPERATION ST STE. WELL THE RESPONSE. IS IT JUST EQUAL. R. FOR PART OF AT THE PUMP CAN FROM PART WHERE ESSENTIALLY TO INFLUENCE THE- TO DO THAT THEY'RE JUST NOT NORMAL. YOU KNOW NORMALLY GONNA DO. AND SO THE I THINK THE STRONG SUPPORT- AND RICE. I WANTED RIGHT TO OWN ONE OF THOSE THINGS TO MAKE SURE THAT ON EMERGENCY SIDE WE CAN LEVERAGE- THOSE FIELD RESOURCES THAT WE ALREADY HAVE- TO ASSIST WITH ACTUALLY HE. I BELIEVE THE- STOCK. RUMORS OPERATE CENTERS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THE SAME WAY YOU WOULD PROBABLY FIND IT- OKAY IS HELPED WITH- LET'S SEE DISTRIBUTION. PERSPECTIVE A QUICK. OR BASS SUPPORTS OF A COUPLE WITH REQUIREMENTS FOR RE OPENING- I SUSPECT ANYONE MY COUNTY WILL BE USING THE SAME MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE. TO PREPARE FOR THE NATION. DISTRIBUTION AND YOU KNOW HE'S GOING TO BE. I'M NOT SURE FOR SEVERAL AND SOME OF THOSE WHO SHOT SERIES THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF CRYPTOGRAPHY THAT'S GOING TO QUAN WITH THAT AND I KNOW WE'VE ALREADY STARTED THOSE DISCUSSIONS. I THINK THE KEY TO THAT LAST PIECE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS GOING TO REST. REPRIEVES EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATIONS THAT YOU HAVE THERE NOW. THE LIST CAN BE MINIMIZED. THIS PRESENT RICE SAID- WAS CLOSE COORDINATION WITH. STATE EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES. AND ENQUIRING ABOUT- ANYTHING. SHE WAS DOWN THERE SEVEN OR- AND THEN BEYOND THAT ALSO THE WHICH SUPPORT- DISTRIBUTION FROM THE MAIN AREAS SO THAT I WOULD SAY AGAIN THAT LAST MILE I THINK THOSE ARE GOING TO BE THE CASE THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CURRENT. THANK YOU- I WILL GO TO HELL ARE YOU. NO NO I'M I'M ALL DONE THANK YOU AND I AND I WILL MY ONLY COMMENT WAS GOING TO BE WELL LET'S GET ON IT. AND DO. SO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON I WANT TO MOVE ON TO OUR OUR FINAL PANEL- YOU KNOW IF THE INTEREST OF TIME IN. AND THE PANELISTS HAVE BEEN GENEROUS ENOUGH TO- PARTICIPATE.

DEAR REYES. SURE THAT WE EMPHASIZE THAT I'M SO I'M CERTAINLY AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION AND GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO GET THINGS THAT WE IN OUR DEPARTMENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU- NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM AB JAMES GORE- SO NO MY COUNTY SUPERVISOR AND PRESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES. GET YOUR WOMAN RIVAS- APPRECIATE A TIME TO BE WITH YOU ALL I'M GONNA MAKE SURE THAT I- THAT I-JUMP IN AND- THE PLEASANTRIES WILL COME BACK AROUND LATER BUT- I REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR DOING THIS- I REPRESENT A DISTRICT IN A COUNTY WHERE WE'VE HAD I BELIEVE HE DECLARED DISASTERS IN THE LAST SIX YEARS SO- EXPERIENCE NOT ONLY IN TAKING IT ON THE CHIN BUT ALSO EXPERIENCED AND TURNING. THAT FROM BEING A MONIKER AFTER DISASTER OF SONOMA STRONG OVER INTO SOME KNOW SOMETHING THAT WE CALL SONOMA READY. AND WITH DEEPER LEVELS OF RESILIENCE I WOULD CALL SONOMA SAFE SO- YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT- WHAT WE CAN DO- TO MAKE SURE THAT THE GIVE AND TAKE OF THE STATE LOCALS. IS IS AN APPROPRIATE PUSHED IN A WAY I THINK ABOUT IT IS A GROUND SWELL. THAT'S COMING UP FROM OUR COUNTIES WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO. MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE DO HOW WE HOW WE EXCHANGE IS BEST PRACTICES. I DON'T GET THEMONEY GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION HOW DO WE DO THE RIGHT KIND OF TESTING ALERT- THE BIT AT THE OTHER TIME WE DEFINITELY NEED YEAH. AND THE STATE ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF- CONTINUITY OF DEFINITIONS- HOW WE USE ALL THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT OUR OUR OUR OUR DIFFERENT JARGON- IN FOR ALERT WARNING SYSTEMS. OFTEN OPT OUT REDUNDANCY SYSTEMS- I WILL GO THROUGH A COUPLE OF THOSE BUT I'LL WAIT FOR QUESTIONS- SENSE WERE. PASSED WITH TIME A LITTLE BIT- SO IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN CINEMA COUNTY WAS CAUGHT ON HIS HEELS. WE HAD- OF THE CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE THAT CAME INTO OUR COMMUNITY- DESTROYED FIFTY THREE HOT HOMES. WELL WE DID NOT. THREE EVACUATE ANYBODY WE HAD SIGNIFICANT. CHAOTIC EVACUATIONS DURING THAT EVENT WHICH WAS A MAKE A FIRE. AND WE AND AS I MENTIONED WE LOST FIFTY THREE HUNDRED HOMES AND EVEN WORSE WE LOST TWENTY FOUR. OF OUR NEIGHBORS FAMILY MEMBERS AND FRIENDS IN OUR COMMUNITY- IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WERE AFTERWARDS WE SAID NEVER AGAIN. WOULD BE CAUGHT ON OUR HEELS. AND WHAT WE'VE GONE THROUGH IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN WITH THE CAN KATE FIRE- TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY WITH BOTH THE- LIGHTNING COMPLEX THE WALLBRIDGE IN THE MEYERS FIRE ON ONE SIDE. AND THE GLASS FAR ON THE OTHER. IS SUSTAINED AND SIGNIFICANT- DANGER FROM SIMILAR EVENTS AND FROM CLIMATIC. SITUATION CHANGING. SO I WILL NOT GO INTO THE DEEPER LEVELS OF RESILIENCE WHICH IS A DIFFERENT COMMITTEE HERE AND I THINK YOU KNOW- WORKING WITH COMMITTED TWENTY FIVE MILLION OUT OF A SETTLEMENT WE HAVE WITH P. JEANNIE TO GO AS A BASE LEVEL OF FUNDING. FOR DEEP VEGETATION MANAGEMENT- SECURING FIRE ACCESS ROADS- SECURING FIRE BREAKS AND OTHER THINGS OF THE OF THE LIKE. BUT WHAT I DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. WHAT I CALL THE TABLE TO FIRES AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY- AS I. WE FIFTY HUNDRED HOMES- WE WERE EVACUATING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIRE STORM. AND WE HAD TWENTY FOUR OF OUR- OF OUR RESIDENTS PASSED AWAY IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE EVACUATED A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS DURING THE COURSE OF THE CAN K. FIRE. WELL WE HAD ZERO DEATHS AND ZERO- EXCUSE ME- MAJOR INJURIES- WE DID I IRONICALLY IN THAT SAME YEAR. I THANK YOU OR OR NOT EVACUATE BUT HAD UPWARDS OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WITHOUT POWER. ON DIFFERENT SITUATIONS FROM THE POWER SHUT DOWNS- WITH PG&amp;E. IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY WE EVACUATED CUMULATIVELY THIS YEAR- EIGHTY SIX TO NINETY THOUSAND PEOPLE. AND THOSE EVACUATIONS WHILE I DON'T WANT TO GO INTO- WHAT DAY BECAUSE- I THINK YOU CAN ALL JOIN ME IN UNDERSTANDING THAT- EVACUATIONS ALSO HAVE AN IMPACT AS WELL- DISPLACING PEOPLE- DISPLACING THE ECONOMY. MOVING EVERYTHING- SPECIALLY DURING COVERT THE SITUATION WE HAD A SPIKE IN OUR CODE NUMBERS. A POST OUR VALUATIONS BUT THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A HUGE IMPACT OF EVACUATING 4260% OF YOUR COMMUNITY DIFFERENT TIMES. EVEN IF IT'S TWENTY OR THIRTY THOUSAND. PEOPLE THAT STILL A LOT BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT HAS- SENATOR JACKSON SAID THE NUMBER PRIVATE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS SAFETY. AND AS SOMEBODY WHO'S NOT ONLY COUNTY SUPERVISOR BUT ALSO- CHAIR BEEN THE CHAIR OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES. AND FOUNDER OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES RESILIENT COUNTIES INITIATIVES WHICH IS DIVING IN. SO YOUKNOW IT'S WHAT WE DID IMMEDIATELY AFTER FIRES IS WE GOT THE BEST PEOPLE IN FRONT OF US. WE HOSTED HEARINGS WE CREATED AND PUT MONEY INTO THE CREATION OF AN OFFICE OF RECOVERY RESILIENCY. WE TRIPLED THE MONEY GOING INTO OUR DEPARTMENT OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. AND- HIRED TWO POSITIONS SPECIFICALLY AND THIS DIRECT FOR A LOWER WARNING- WE IN THE YEAR FOLLOWING OUR FIRE WE TESTED WITH A LIVE FEED OUR ALERT WARNING SYSTEM- EFFECTIVELY CHANGING WHAT I WOULD CALL THE BLACK AISLADOS IS THE COUNTY GOVERNMENT. OF FOR NOT- DO USING UTILIZING EVACUATIONS ARE NOT BEING TRAINED AND EVEN PREPARE TO USE THOSE SYSTEMS. TO NOW BEING THE POINT OF THE SPEAR IN TERMS OF FIGURING IT OUT THIS IS ONE THING I WOULD RECOMMEND FOR THIS COMMITTEE AND OTHERS TO LOOK AT. IS AND NOT JUST THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE LOCALS HAVE TO HAVE LOCAL HAZARD MITIGATION PLANS- TO BE ABLE TO QUALIFY FOR FUNDING BUT ALSO. ACTIVE TESTING ACTIVE EXERCISES DEPLOYMENT IN YOUR COMMUNITY- QUITE HONESTLY THERE IS NO REPLACEMENT FOR IT- I COULD GO THROUGH A LITANY OF OTHER THINGS THAT WE DID TO PREPARE COMMUNITY BUT SENTENCES ABOUT ALERT. AND NOTIFICATION I JUST WANT TO HIT A FEW WHICH IS- YOU KNOW- WE'VE WE'VE DONE THINGS LIKE CINEMA READY DAY WERE pSHOW UP AND WE'VE GIVEN OUR GO BAGS. WELL WE'VE REDEPLOYED FROM ONE THING I THINK YOU GUYS SHOULD CONSIDER FROM A NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM- WHICH CAN NOT HANDLE ALL OF THE PHONE CALLS FROM PEOPLE BEING EVACUATED. INTO THAT MUCH MORE OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOMETHING FROM SAN DIEGO IN ANOTHER SYSTEM RUN OUT OF ENSURE A WHICH IS TWO ONE ONE. WHICH IS A VITAL ELEMENT. INSTEAD OF. IT GETTING OUT. ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT- I WOULD SAY THE MOST AND- THING WHEN WE TALK YOU. IS THAT YOU HAVE TO GO AFTER WHERE PEOPLE GET COMMUNICATION- YOU HAVE TO GO AFTER SOCIAL MEDIA YOU HAVE TO GO AFTER EMAILS YOU HAVE TO GO AFTER PRINT MEDIA RADIO OTHERWISE. BUT AT THE SAME POINT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LANDING PAGE YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE COME BACK TO- THAT WAS SOMETHING WE CREATE A CULTURE SO CALL EMERGENCY DOT ORG. AND AND ALTERNATELY YOU KNOW HAVEN'T BEEN A PERSON WHO'S DONE EVACUATION- EXERCISES A SAD JOINTLY WITH SHERIFF'S OFFICERS AND HI LO SIRENS ON MONDAY. OR SKEWS ME ON SATURDAY MORNINGS AND DRIVEN THROUGH- CRAZY NEIGHBORHOODS. AND DONE THE HIGH LOW SIRENS AND DONE THE WE ALERTS. AND DONE ALSO THE NOAA WEATHER ALERTS AND DONE ALL KINDS OF REDUNDANCY TESTS ONE THING I WANT YOU ALL TO KNOW AND- IS THAT. BASICALLY IT'S A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND AND THOSE IN CHARGE- I THINK THE BIGGEST THINGS THAT YOU'RE FACED WITH LOOKING OUT JUST LIKE WE ARE. IS- HOW DO WE EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATE WITH NEW TECH AND ALL TECH- I FOR ONE IN THE BIG FAN OF GETTING SIRENS BACK OUT THERE IN HARD TO REACH AREAS- YOU CAN EXPECT THAT EVERYBODY CAN WORK I KNOW THE WEATHER RADIO- OR THAT OUR SYSTEM WILL WORK PERFECTLY WHEN YOU HAVE CANYONS IN DIFFICULT AREAS WITH CELLPHONE. I ALSO FULLY SUPPORT OPT OUT PROGRAMS BECAUSE- PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS SAYING THAT IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH- BUT YET THEY DON'T SIGN UP FOR OFTEN PROGRAMS- I'M A HUGE FAN OF- OF THE STATE HELPING US WITH- DEFINITIONS AND JARGON- AND WE CURRENTLY HAVE STILL EVEN THOUGH WE'RE CONSIDERED ONE OF THE TOP IN THE CLASS AN ALERT WARNING. WE STILL HAVE HUGE ISSUES WITH DIFFERENCES IN. DISTRICTS WITH A FIRE DISTRICTS- SHERIFF'S- COUNTY- CITY IS. AN OTHERS OVERLAPPING IN TERMS OF HOW THEY DO L. THERE- YOUR NOTIFICATION AND I DIDN'T. YOU THINGS. DO YOU CALL IN ALL CLEAR ON YOU'VE DONE IT DO YOU ANNOUNCES THIS BUT NOW THIS- CREATES LOT OF CONFUSION IN THE COMMUNITY AND THE EXPECTATIONS COULD NEVER BE HIGHER OF OUR CONSTITUENTS GIVE US THIS VITAL INFORMATION- AND AS I SAID BEFORE. IS NOT JUST THIS IDEA OF. CREATING REDUNDANT SYSTEMS IN PLACES THAT CAN TAKE THE HUGE. LOAD OF QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS LIKE SOMETHING LIKE A TWO ONE ONE RATHER THAN THE NINE ONE ONE THAT GETS OVERWHELMED. WITH A FEW. THOUSAND CALLS BUT ALSO- WORK THAT WE'VE DONE HEAVILY. AS MUCH AS WITH OUR EVACUATIONS OF OUR INCIDENTS BUT WITH OUR POWER SHUT DOWNS FOR OUR ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS COMMUNITY. SO I'LL I'LL I'LL LEAVE IT IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS I'D APPRECIATE MY COMMENTS BECAUSE OF- TIMELINESS. I JUST APPRECIATE YOU ALL- THERE IS A HUGE ROLE FOR THE STATE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH US AND SEE SECOND I PERSONALLY STAND READY TO. HELP YOU IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM THANK YOU. THANK YOU SUPERVISOR GORE OUR FINAL PANELIST FOR THE HEARING- IS A PAUL CUMMINS. NEVADA COUNTY EMERGENCY SERVICES PROGRAM% MANAGER REPRESENTING THE RURAL COUNTY. REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA. YEAH MADAM CHAIR AND DISTINGUISHED COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME'S PAUL CUMMINGS AND I'M GONNA DIE COUNTY. OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES PROGRAM MANAGER. I'M ALSO RETIRED AIR FORCE OFFICER IN AND OUT OF COUNTY RESIDENT. I'M HERE TODAY TO SHARE THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES FACED BY A RURAL COMMUNITY AS THEY RELATE TO EMERGENCY DISASTER RESPONSE SPECIFICALLY EMERGENCY ALERTS AND EVACUATIONS. NEVADA COUNTY IS NESTLED IN THE FOOTHILLS OF THE SIERRA NEVADA ABOUT AN HOUR NORTHEAST OF SACRAMENTO AND AN HOUR WEST OF LAKE TAHOE. THE RUGGED LANDSCAPE THE RICH PRECOLONIAL GOLD RUSH HISTORY. YUBA RIVER WHICH FANS ARE COUNTY AS WELL AS HUNDREDS OF MILES OF DESOLATE HIKING BIKING AND EQUESTRIAN TRAILS BRINGS THOUSANDS OF TOURISTS WERE GREAT COMMUNITY EVERY YEAR. IT IS THE SAME RUGGED LANDSCAPE WITH STEEP GAINS AND THICK FORESTS THE DRIVES ARE VAST WILDFIRE RISK THREATENS P. GENIES INFRASTRUCTURE ON RED FLAG DAYS DRIVING FREQUENT WIDESPREAD PUBLIC SAFETY PARTIALS. 92% OF NEVADA COUNTY RESIDENTS LIVE IN A HIGH OR VERY HIGH WILDFIRE SEVERITY ZONE LOOKING AT CAL FIRE'S RISK MAP FOR ACCOUNTING. WILDFIRE IS THE NUMBER ONE THREAT A RESIDENT'S FACE. OUR COMMUNITY IS ENGAGED AND LEANING INTO REDUCING THIS THREAT TO HAZARD EDUCATION MITIGATION AND READINESS PLAN. ON AUGUST SEVENTEENTH OF THIS YEAR OUR RESIDENTS WERE PUT TO THE TEST WHEN REGIONAL WEATHER SYSTEM CREATING NUMEROUS LIGHTNING STRIKES SPARKED EARLY MORNING FIRES ACROSS THE ACCOUNTING. THIS SAME SYSTEM WREAKED HAVOC ACROSS A LARGE SWATH OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. ONE OF THOSE FIRES WAS THE JONES FIRE WHICH IGNITED IN THE YUBA RIVER CANYON NOT FAR FROM THE CITY AND THE COUNTY SEAT. THIS FIRE BURNED SEVEN HUNDRED FIVE ACRES OVER TWELVE DAYS. IN TOTAL OVER FOUR THOUSAND RESIDENTS WERE EVACUATED AND ULTIMATELY TWENTY ONE STRUCTURES WERE DESTROYED. THANKS TO THE HARD WORK OF OUR LOCAL FIREFIGHTERS ALONG WITH CAL FIRE MANY MORE WERE SAVED AND NO LIES NO LIVES WERE LOST. THE NEVADA COUNTY JONES FOR WAS AN EXAMPLE OF EVERYTHING GOING RIGHT- COUNTY ISSUED MULTIPLE CODE RED AND WE ARE MESSAGES TO OUR RESIDENTS WERE READY TO EVACUATE WITH GO BAGS PACKED. WE HAVE A LARGE SEGMENT OF OUR RESIDENTS SIGNED UP FOR OPT IN SYSTEM AND THOSE NUMBERS ARE GROWING. MITCHELL EIGHT FOR FIRE SUPPRESSION AND EVACUATION WAS SWIFT AND EFFECTIVE. IN OUR MEDIA PARTNERS IN COUNTY OFFICES COLLABORATED TO PUSH TIMELY UPDATES TO THE PUBLIC AROUND THE FIRE STATUS. EVACUATION AREAS. MOST IMPORTANTLY OUR LANDLINE AND CELLPHONE INFRASTRUCTURE REMAIN INTACT SO THE RESIDENTS CAN RECEIVE CRITICAL EVACUATION WARNING IN ORDER NOTICES. NOW LET'S IMAGINE THAT THE JONES FIRE PLAYING OUT DURING A COUNTY WIDE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF. IN TWENTY TWENTY AND I COUNTY RESIDENTS INJURED FOR PS PS EVENTS IN SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER WITH JIM OF OUTAGES SPANNING EIGHT DAYS. WHERE AT ITS PEAK 40% OF NEVADA COUNTY WAS WITHOUT POWER. RESIDENTS OUTSIDE OUR TOWN AND CITY CENTRESSTRUGGLE WITH COMMUNICATIONS ON A GOOD DAY. SOME COMMUNITIES ARE COUNTY DON'T HAVE CELL PHONE COVERAGE AT ALL AND RELY ON LAND LINE SERVICE FROM ONE PROVIDER. I LINES ARE SUPPOSED TO REMAIN UP AND RUNNING SO THAT PEOPLE CAN CALL NINE ONE ONE OR RECEIVE ALERT AND WARNING CALLS. HOWEVER THIS SERVICE HAS NOT REMAINED OPERATIONAL IN OUR POWER SHUT OFFS THIS LEAVES OUR RESIDENTS EXPOSED AND VULNERABLE. AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE AN OVERNIGHT POWER OUTAGE WITH THE EARLY MORNING WILDFIRE WOULD MAKE ALERT AND WARNING OF THESE RESIDENTS VERY CHALLENGING. THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF WHICH RESULTS IN THE LOSS OF A SINGLE CELL PHONE TOWER OR A NON OPERATIONAL LANDLINE CAN ISOLATE LARGE SWATHS OF OUR RESIDENTS. THIS INTERRUPTION OF SERVICE ISN'T THE SAME AS A CELLPHONE TOWER GOING DOWN THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO. ONCE OUR WERE NON OPERATIONAL AND LINE HAS LITERALLY BECOME A SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE IN OUR NOTIFICATION SYSTEM. WIRELESS EMERGENCY ALERTS ARE A VERY EFFECTIVE SYSTEM DOES NOT REQUIRE AN OFTEN BUT ARE NOT AN OPTION WHEN ARE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS ARE NOW. WE HAVE NEVADA COUNTY RESIDENTS HANGING ONTO A PRECIOUS FEW LIFELINES OF COMMUNICATION AMONG THOSE GO DOWN THEY ARE FLOATING ON THEIR OWN. WE'RE CLOSELY FOLLOWING TWO PIECES OF LEGISLATION THAT WILL HELP US BOLSTER TELECOMMUNICATIONS IN OUR COMMUNITY. ONE OF SENATE BILL SIX SEVENTY WHICH PASSED LAST YEAR REQUIRES TELECOMS AND STATE- YES TO PASS OUTAGE INFORMATION TO COUNTY- YES. JOHNNY SHERIFF AND NINE ONE ONE DISPATCHERS. THUS FAR WHAT WE KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN OUTAGES IN OUR COUNTY. OUR OFFICE HAS NOT RECEIVED ANY NOTIFICATION. THE SECOND IS SENATE BILL FOR THIRTY ONE THAT IF PASSED WILL REQUIRE THE PROVISION OF BACKUP POWER WHERE FEASIBLE. TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM CELL SERVICE FOR AT LEAST SEVENTY TWO HOURS. AS HAS BEEN ALREADY STATED MANY RESIDENTS HAVE FOR GONNA TRADITIONAL LANDLINE AND NOW RELY ON VOICE OVER IP PHONE. AS THEIR SOLE SOURCE OF COMMUNICATION. WHICH REQUIRES AN ATTACK INTERNET ACCESS WHICH DURING PUBLIC SAFETY PERSONNEL SO OFTEN TIMES IS UNAVAILABLE. OUR OFFICE AS WELL AS OUR COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HAVE RECEIVED NUMEROUS EMAILS AND PHONE CALLS FROM CONCERNED RESIDENTS OF LOS ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WHEN THEY NEED TO THE MONTHS. DURING A HIGH FIRE DANGER RED FLAG DAY. WE ASK THAT YOU SUPPORT THE PASSAGE OF SENATE BILL FOR THIRTY ONE WHICH WILL CREATE REDUNDANCIES AND CELLPHONE NETWORKS AND ALLOW THEM TO OPERATE FOR UP TO THREE DAYS INDEPENDENT OF COMMERCIAL POWER. THIS WILL ENSURE RESIDENTS HAVE RELIABLE COMMUNICATIONS DURING YES YES. PG'S CURRENT DOWN IT'S GREAT TO PROTECT IT FROM THE FIRE FROM THE HIGH FIRE DANGER PRODUCED BY RED FLAG CONDITIONS IN THE SAME CONDITIONS ARE THREATENING OUR COMMUNITIES. WE ALSO ASK THAT ACTION BE TAKEN WHEN TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS DO NOT DELIVER LANDLINE SERVICES WHEN THE POWER IS OUT. DURING A GRID DOWN SCENARIO MANY NEVADA COUNTY RESIDENTS CAN'T CALL NINE ONE ONE OR RECEIPT OF ACTUATION NOTIFICATIONS WHEN THEY NEED THEM THE MOST. IT TAKES TIME TO EVACUATE THOUSANDS OF RESIDENTS SOME OF WHICH MAY HAVE ONLY ONE WAY IN AND ONE WAY OUT. EARLY ALERT MORNING ARE CRITICAL TO SAFELY EVACUATE RESIDENTS WHO LIVE WITH LIMITED EGRESS OPTIONS. ANOTHER SET OF CHALLENGES ARE COUNTY MUST CONSIDER OR THE NOTIFICATION AND TRANSPORTATION NEEDS OF OUR NEIGHBORS WITH DISABILITIES IN OLDER ADULTS. THE DATA SHOWS THAT THESE MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS ARE OF THE HIGHEST LIKELIHOOD TO PERISH IN A FAST MOVING WILDFIRE. OUR COUNTY HAS A HIGH POPULATION OF SENIORS THAT MAY REQUIRE EXTRA TIME TO DOCUMENT. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE ARE RESIDENTS WHO FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER DO NOT OR CANNOT DRIVE. THE PROSPECT OF FINDING TRANSPORTATION HAVING A PLAN IN A PLACE TO GO. ABOVE SOME OF OUR SENIORS CHOOSING TO RISK THEIR LIVES. AND REMAIN WITHIN THEIR HOMES INSTEAD OF POTENTIALLY LOSING THEIR INDEPENDENCE AND DIGNITY. THE CARE OF WELL MEANING STRANGERS. SHORTLY AFTER THE JONES FIRE I TOOK A CALL FROM A WOMAN IN HER EIGHTIES WHO LIVED ALONE AND WAS ORDERED TO EVACUATE FOR THE JONES FOR. JUST PICKED UP MY FAMILY MEMBER WHO WAS UNABLE TO CARE FOR HER AND HAD TO DROP HER OFF IN AN ADULT CARE FACILITY THAT WAS NOT ABLE TO MEET HER NEEDS. SHE WAS LEFT IN A WHEELCHAIR ALL NIGHT SITTING IN SOILED CLOTHES SHE WAS DESPERATE. AND FELT SHE HAD NO OPTIONS SHOULD THERE BE ANOTHER FOR. SHE FELT NEXT TIME SHE MIGHT BE FORGOTTEN IN HER AND IN HER WORDS LEFT TO BURN. OUR PHONE LINES WERE DOWN DO IT PS PS. SHE MAY NOT HAVE GOTTEN A NOTIFICATION AT ALL. IN CLOSING. WE ADVOCATE FOR HOLDING TELECOMMUNICATIONS UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE HARDENING THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT LANDLINES AND CELLULAR TELECOMMUNICATIONS REMAIN OPERATIONAL DURING CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER WE ALSO ASK THAT THE NEEDS OF OUR ELDERS AND NEIGHBORS THE DISABILITIES BE CENTERED IN THE DISCUSSION OF POLICY. AS IT RELATES TO EMERGENCY RESPONSE TO DISASTERS. IT IS CRITICAL WE MAINTAIN FUNCTIONING SYSTEMS OF COMMUNICATION AND NOTIFICATION. AS WELL AS OUR SYSTEMS OF TRANSPORTATION AND SHELTER THAT SERVE THE WHOLE COMMUNITY. OUR CAN DOES HAVE A LOCAL HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN WE HAVE APPLIED FOR HAZARD MITIGATION GRANT PROGRAM FUNDS TO HELP MITIGATE THE THREAT AREA. THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION TO SPEAK WITH THE OFFICE MORE THIS AFTERNOON. AND I'M AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU TO ALL THE PANELISTS- FOR BEING HERE WITH US TODAY AND PROVIDING A LOCAL GOVERNMENT PERSPECTIVE WHICH IS. A MUCH NEEDED IN THIS ISSUE AREA- DO YOU DO HAVE A QUESTION SENATE MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH- MADAM CHAIR I JUST WANTED TO MAKE A QUICK COMMENT AND SAY THANK YOU TO SUPERVISOR GORE. INCOMING PRESIDENT NOW PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES. AS WELL AS MISTER CUMMINGS MISSPELLED IN THAT FOR THEIR WORK LOOK I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IS WHILE PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE THERE IS OBVIOUS. OBVIOUSLY MUCH MORE WORK AHEAD IN PARTNERSHIP I THINK THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE THAT THREE YEAR LEADERSHIP MADAM CHAIR AND THOSE. IN THE LEGISLATURE BEEN IMPACTED BY THESE LARGE MAKE A WHILE THEN FIRES- IT IS UP TO US TO BE A TO CONTINUE TO. PARTNER UP WHETHER IT'S ISSUES EMERGENCY ALERTS FOCUSING ON ALL ISSUES OF EVACUATIONS HOW WE CAN IMPROVE THAT. IN THE BASICS OF JUST. BEING ABLE TO GET MORE BOOTS ON THE GROUND IS WELL SO AGAIN VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT THE PERSPECTIVES OF THOSE GOVERNMENT LEADERS THAT WERE WITH US TODAY ON THIS FINAL PANEL. THANK YOU I. IF THERE THERE'S NO OTHER QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS I'D I BELIEVE THERE ARE NOT OKAY THANK YOU- NEXT I WANT TO MOVE ON TO PUBLIC COMMENT AND I WANT TO START WITH A MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IN THE ROOM IF YOU CAN COME UP TO THE MICROPHONE AND I JUST WANT TO REMIND YOU TO KEEP YOUR MASK ON AND DO NOT TOUCH THE MICROPHONE- AND IF YOU COULD PLEASE LIMIT YOUR COMMENT TWO ONE MINUTE.
