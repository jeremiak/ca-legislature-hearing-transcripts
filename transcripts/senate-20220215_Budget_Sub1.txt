SO WITH NO FURTHER ADO. WE'RE GOING TO GO TO ISSUE NUMBER ONE WHICH IS SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION AND HERE WITH US OUR WINNER GRANT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE CAN COUPON FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE ONE MORALIS. FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE PANELISTS IN THAT ORDER AND WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN WITH WIENER GRANT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION NO WELCOME TO THE SUB COMMITTEE. I THANK YOU LEANING GREAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU TRAILER AND SENATORS- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES ONE POINT FIVE BILLION ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. TO SUPPORT THE SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION GRANT PROGRAM WHICH FOCUSES ON GREENING SCHOOL BUS FLEETS. THIS IS A GRANTS OF AT LEAST FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS WOULD BE AVAILABLE WITH PRIORITY FOR RETIRING OUR LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES OLDEST INTERNAL COMBUSTION BUSES. ELEAZAR THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF UNDUPLICATED PUPILS AS WELL AS SMALL AND RURAL RURAL ELEAZAR. IN KEEPING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S LARGER FOCUS ON REDUCING HARMFUL VEHICLE EMISSIONS WITH GRANTS OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND ELLIE EIGHT WILL BE ABLE TO ACQUIRE ELECTRIC SCHOOL BUS PURCHASE AND CONSTRUCT THE BUSES CHARGING STATION AND ALSO SUPPORT OTHER LOCAL. SCHOOL BUS TRANSPORTATION NEEDS. THESE INVESTMENTS WILL RESULT IN ONGOING SAVINGS TO TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS THAT CAN BE USED TO SUPPORT OTHER ASPECTS OF AN ALLEY A STUDENT TRANSPORT REMARKS- BUT I'M APPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL DO THE QUESTIONS AFTER ALL THREE PANELISTS HAVE PRESENTED WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS CAN COMBINE WITH THE ANALYST OFFICE SOME BRIEF BACKGROUND HERE. A SCHOOL DISTRICTS CURRENTLY OWN ABOUT SIXTEEN THOUSAND SCHOOL BUSES NEARLY TWO THIRDS OF THOSE BUSES ARE DIESEL. IN MANY OF THOSE DIESEL BUSES ARE OLDER MODELS THAT WERE MANUFACTURED UNDER LESS STRINGENT EMISSION STANDARDS THAN THOSE EXISTING TODAY. OTHER MAJOR DISTRICTS FLEETS GENERALLY OPERATE ON A ALTERNATIVE FUELS MAINLY COPRESSED NATURAL GAS OR PROPANE. ELECTRIC BUSES ARE THE NEWEST OPTION DISTRICTS BEYOND BUYING ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO AND CURRENTLY OWNS SEVERAL HUNDRED STATEWIDE. ELECTRIC BUSES HAVE SNORKEL ADVANTAGES THAT THEY DO NOT PRODUCE ANY TAILPIPE EMISSIONS HONEYMOON HELPS. IT SIGNIFICANTLY LESS GREENHOUSE. GAS AND TO BE TO OPERATE BECAUSE THEY LIKE. TO TRY TO BE JUST LAST SIX AND YOU FUEL. AT THE MAIN LIMIT IS RANGE NOT MANY ELECTED BY. HAVE A MAX RANGE TODAY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY AND A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES. IN THAT RANGE CAN OFTEN BE LASSEN STRENUOUS OPERATING CONDITIONS LIKE MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN ARE HOT AND COLD WEATHER. AND THE UP FRONT COST AN ELECTRIC BUS ALSO ARE ABOUT TWICE AS MUCH AS THE UP FRONT COST OF THE DIESEL BUS OF THE PROPOSAL. I WOULD POINT OUT THAT IT IS ON TOP OF A LARGE FEDERAL PROGRAM CREATED LAST NOVEMBER. FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS STATE PROGRAM CREATED IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET. AND A COUPLE OF SMALLER STATE PROGRAMS. THAT WE THINK THE ADMINISTRATION HAS ADVANCED A PROMISING IDEA. USING ONE TIME FUNDS TO PURCHASE ELECTRIC BUSES COULD PROVIDE EMISSION BENEFITS THAT WOULD LAST FOR MANY YEARS. AND IT WOULD GIVE DISTRICTS SOME COST RELEASE- BOTH RELATED TO THE COST OF REPLACING OLDER BUSES. AND OVER A LONGER PERIOD THE COST OF PURCHASING FUEL. I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU ADOPT THE PROPOSAL I WAS A COUPLE OF MODIFICATIONS. THE FIRST WOULD BE TO MAKE SPEED MY MAIN PRIORITY OF THE PROGRAM- THE REPLACEMENT OF OLDER BUSES. SO WHERE IS THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES THE AGE OF THE BUSES BEING REPLACED AS ONE FACTOR. YOU RECKON MAKING IT THE MAIN FACTOR. AND THAT'S BECAUSE OLDER BUSES EMIT MORE POLLUTION REPLACING THEM FIRST BUT MAXIMIZE THE POTENTIAL. AIR QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS. WE ARE ALLOWING FOR OTHER TYPES OF. AND BUS ARE NOT. THIS IS AN ISSUE PRIMARY AFFECTS DISTRICTS WITH LONGER. ROUTE AND IN THOSE DISTRICTS REPLACING OLDER NOT YOU NOT LIKE BUSQUETS ACHIEVE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN POLLUTION. THAT WE RECOMMEND ELIMINATING THE QUESTION OF THE GRANTS THAT WOULD PROVIDE FUNDING FOR OTHER TRANSPORTATION% COSTS. US ABOUT 10% OF THE PROPOSAL. I THAT QUESTION OF THE GRANT TO BUY DOES NOT SEEM CLEARLY CONNECTED WITH UNDERLYING COSTS OF PURCHASING LIKE TO SCHOOL BUSES WERE RUNNING A SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM. WE ALSO HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT IT COULD DISCOURAGE DISTRICTS REPLYING FOR BUS REPLACEMENT FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR OTHER STATE PROGRAMS. SOME OF THOSE OTHER PROGRAMS DO NOT PROVIDE THAT ADDITIONAL ON. I WOULD RECKON STARTING OF THE SMALLER INITIAL TO THE POINT. AND ALLOCATE FUNDING SEVERAL. WHICH WOULD GIVE THE LEGISLATURE OPPORTUNITY YOU TO ADJUST THE PROGRAM IN THE FUTURE BASED ON INTEREST IN THE PROGRESS OF THE STATE NEXT TOWARDS A PLACING. THE OLDER BUSES SO FOR EXAMPLE ONE OPTION COULD BE TO START WITH AN INITIAL ALLOCATION OF FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH TO REPLACE MORE THAN A THOUSAND SCHOOL BUSES AND THEN PLAN FOR SUBSEQUENT INSTALLMENTS OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS. IF YOU DO START WITH THE FULL ONE POINT FIVE BILLION THAT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES. WE'D RECOMMEND ALLOWING SOME OF THAT FUNDING TO BE USED FOR EXPANDING DISTRICT FLEETS NOT JUST A PLACING DISTINCT BUSES. AND THAT APPROACH WOULD ENSURE THAT THE STATE CAN ALLOCATE THE FULL AMOUNT INTERESTED INTERESTED DISTRICTS. WELL WOULD SEE CONCERT WHICH DAY AGENCY AS BEST POSITIONED TO ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM. THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES IT TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WE THINK THEY ARE CAPABLE OF MANAGING THE PROGRAM THEY BY MANY TYPES OF COMPETITIVE GRANTS AND THEY PREVIOUSLY MANAGED A SMALL BUS REPLACEMENT PROGRAM FOR SMALL DISTRICTS. ON THE OTHER HAND THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD ALREADY OVERSEES THE BUS REPLACEMENT PROGRAM CREATED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. AND A DIVIDING TO SIMILAR PROGRAMS ACROSS THE TWO AGENCIES LIKE WE WOULD REQUIRE I BOTH HAVE AN EDUCATION AND THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO ENGAGE IN SOME SIGNIFICANT COORDINATION SINCE MANY DISTRICTS LIKE THAT WOULD APPLY FOR BOTH. BOTH BOTH GRANT PARK. I THIS NEW APPROACH TO THE AREAS BOARD MIGHT AVOID OF THAT AND FORTH YES ONE RESPONDING ELKE PROCESS. AND THAT CONCLUDES OUR COMMON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MOVE TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. WHY MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AGAIN MY NAME IS JUANITA ELLIS I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE SCHOOL FACILITIES AND TRANSPORTATION SERVICES DIVISION ATTY IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE WITH YOU TODAY. FIRST WE DO WANT TO THANK THE ADMINISTRATION FOR PROPOSING SUCH A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN THE AREA SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION WE KNOW THAT MANY STUDENTS RELY ON A SCHOOL BUS TO BE ABLE TO GET TO SCHOOL EACH DAY. IN FACT IT IS ESTIMATED THAT APPROXIMATELY ONE MILLION STUDENTS AND TRANSPORTED DAILY. TRANSFERS TO ATTEND SCHOOL BUS HAS PROVEN NOT TO BE NOT ONLY THE SAFEST WAYTO GET TO SCHOOL. BUT IT ALSO HELPS REMOVE OTHER CARS FROM THE ROAD. AS ONE SCHOOL BUS CAN CARRY THE EQUIVALENT ABOUT THIRTY SIX CARS. WE ALSO AGREE THE OLDER SCHOOL BUSES NEED TO BE REPLACED WITH NEWER TECHNOLOGY. THAT WILL NOT ONLY HELP CALIFORNIA ACHIEVE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS. BUT THEY WILL ALSO LOWER THE OPERATIONAL COST FOR OUR DAILY AS- AND NOT JUST MUCH MORE SHORT TERM BUT FOR MANY YEARS TO COME THE MINISTRATIONS PROPOSING TO INVEST ONE POINT FIVE BILLION. FOR THE CREATION OF THE SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION GRANT PROGRAM. TO REPLACE OLDER BUSES IN SOME OF THE NEEDIEST AREAS OF THE STATE. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THE FUNDING WILL REPLACE APPROXIMATELY THREE THOUSAND OLDER BUSES. SO THE IMPACT THAT THIS INVESTMENT WILL HAVE ON OUR SCHOOLS. OUR COMMUNITIES AND THE ENVIRONMENT IN GENERAL IS QUITE CLEAR. OF COURSE ADMINISTERING SUCH A LARGE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THROUGH A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROCESS WOULD REQUIRE DEDICATED RESOURCES TO ENSURE THE PROGRAM'S SUCCESS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE ADMINISTRATION FUNDS PROPOSAL. THANK YOU THANK YOU OUR OUR APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS. WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO QUESTIONS AND I'M GOING TO BEGIN. N. LET ME ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. OF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S JUST POINTED OUT THAT THIS WOULD CREATE TO GRANT PROGRAMS INTO DEPARTMENTS THAT NEED TO BE COORDINATED AND- FOR- MIGHT BE CONFUSING AND- WHY. OF DID YOU CHOOSE TO HAVE THESE TWO PROGRAMS- IT DID NOT PUT OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF. OF THIS NEW PROGRAM WITH CARB THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. I THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION LEAK IN A GRANT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'M STILL ALTHOUGH CARDS FUNDING OF ELECTRIC BUSES THAT'S PROVIDE INCENTIVE. GRANT SUPPORT I LIAISE TO PURCHASE AN ELECTRIC SCHOOL BUS THAT THOSE INCENTIVES OUT SURE IS ONLY PARTIALLY COVER THE COST OF AN ELECTRIC BUS IN BED POGRAM WE'RE PROPOSING WOULD BE PROPOSING TO OUR ALL RIGHT REPLACE A DIESEL BUSES WITH ELECTRIC BUS AT A MINIMUM IT WOULD ALSO PROVIDE. ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO ACQUIRE THE CHARGING STATION INFRASTRUCTURE- AND WE'RE CERTAINLY COORDINATING OUR EFFORTS WITH BOTH CARD AND THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS PROGRAM SO WE CAN BETTER ALIGN OUR EFFORTS AND LIKE ON MY. A COLLEAGUE AT THE ALLEY- MENTIONED- THAT CITY HAS HIS STORY USE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND ON SCHOOL BUSES- LIKE THE FORMER SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICT. TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM THEN THAT RAN FOR MANY YEARS FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX I BELIEVE TWENTY TWELVE. THAT WAS THEN ABSORBED INTO THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA- I THINK THAT WAS ALSO MENTIONED IN THE REPORT ON PAGE SEVEN. HOME TO SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM JUST CURRENTLY AN ADD ON WITHIN THE LC FIVE ALSO ALLOWS. FOR THE PURCHASE OF A SCHOOL BUS THAT SPECIFICALLY AUTHORIZES BASSES AS THE PAYMENT OF MONIES BY A SCHOOL DISTRICT OR COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS- FOR THE REPLACEMENT OUR ACQUISITION OF SCHOOL BUSES. I'M SO CURRENTLY THERE THERE'S ALREADY AN ABILITY FOR LEDS TO USE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO PURCHASE A SCHOOL BUS AND WE ARE. SUPPORTING WE'RE TRYING TO ACCELERATE THIS EFFORT TO BRING SCHOOL BUS FLEETS. AROUND THE STATE. OUR LET ME MAY A CALM NOW ON THE RATHER THAN- AT THE END OF THIS. SECTION AND I THINK FREQUENTLY ONCE PRO DIFFERENT PROGRAMS OR STAB WISHED. ARE YOU GO AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SAY WHY WAS THIS DIVIDED WHAT WHAT PRICES IN TWO DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND- YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY USUALLY. FOR ONE AGENCY TO SAY. R. THIS IS REALLY GOOD FOR THE PARTIAL REPLACEMENT THAT'S WHAT YOU QUALIFY FOR SHOULD GO HERE FOR ALL WE COULD DO THE FULL BOAT IF YOU PART WE CAN FUND THE WHOLE THING TO THE CHARGING STATION DO THE OTHER THINGS THAT YOU MENTIONED AND- I WOULD JUST ASK THAT BETWEEN NOW AND THE MAY REVISE YOU GIVE REAL CONSIDERATION TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY SHOULD BE CONSOLIDATED IN ONE AGENCY. BECAUSE THAT MAKES A LOT OF SAID SAID N. I JUST KNOW THAT. IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THESE OTHER THINGS I MEAN IF YOU LOOK AT THE CLEAN WATER PROGRAM WHERE IT WAS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND NOT COORDINATED. IN MANY NOT GETTING OUT THE DOOR AND NOT COORDINATING- WITH THE WATER BOARD AND IF IN THE- ARM. IN THE END ID IT HAD TO BE MOVED TO THE WATER BOARDS SO THAT THAT KIND OF COORDINATION HAPPENED FORTY AND I THINK THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING HERE AND WE HAVE A CHANCE TO GET A HOLD OF IT BEFORE WE EVEN START. SAW I JUST HOPE OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS YOU WOULD GIVE CONSIDERATION TO THAT. AND MY SECOND QUESTION- THE FINANCE PERSON JUST ADDRESSED WHICH IS I WAS GONNA ASK IF THIS IS APPROPRIATE WITHIN PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT OR WHETHER IT'S BETTER OUTSIDE BECAUSE WE HAVE RECEIVED SOME CRITICISM. OF FROM FROM DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS THAT WE'VE THAT PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT SHOULD BEFOCUSED ON INSTRUCTION IN AND THIS IS. IS NOT THAT SO- WE JUST HEARD THE OPINION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LET ME ASK DELAY- IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING. YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADD ON THAT SUBJECT. YEAH WE DON'T ANY I READ THAT THIS COULD USE PROPER. NINETY EIGHT FIND THIS PROGRAM. AT LEAST FUNDED ON THIS TRAFFIC NUMBER A PLACE PROGRAM AND- I NEED AN- AND THIS. PROPOSAL SEEMS LIKELY COOLEY PROVIDED BENEFIT TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND STUDENTS. BOTH IN THE FORM OF HELPING THEM RUN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS THAT THEY FIND BENEFICIAL. AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL FOR COST SAVINGS IN THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS. SO YOU KNOW I THINK THEY COULD BE DEPENDING ON THE OVERALL CONSIDERING YOUR OVERALL BUDGET PACKAGE ON THE- THINGS YOU WANT TO DO WITHIN THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT AND I'M PROBABLY JUST NINETY EIGHT BUDGET. YOU CAN THINK ABOUT WHICH FUNDS TO USE BUT- WE WOULDN'T HAVE ANY IN SORT OF. CONSTITUTIONAL PROPOSITION NINETY CONCERNS ABOUT FUNDING THIS PROGRAM WASN'T GUARANTEE. THANK YOU. AND I KNOW THAT FOR SOME OF STATE CALLED THAT MAY CHRIS. IT'S MISTER CON. ISSUE IT'S A FUNCTIONAL. WHERE IT SHOULD BE DONE BUT I APPRECIATE THAT BUT APPARENTLY EVERYBODY'S HAVING FUN TUNING UP MY NEXT QUESTION IN THE PREVIOUS ONE SO. OUR MODEL ASK QUESTION. MMHM RELATES. TO HOME TO SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION IN GENERAL. AND THE- I THINK IT WAS IN THE TWENTY TWELVE TWENTY THIRTEEN YEAR. OF THE LEGISLATURE GOVERNOR FROZE LOCAL- EDUCATION AGENCIES THE L. E. A. FUNDING OF FOR THOSE STATE FUNDED ARE HOME TO SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION AND PRESIDENT PLACE SO THERE SOME SCHOOLS TO DO IT BUT THEY DO IT AT A LEVEL THAT IS NOW ALMOST TEN YEARS OLD SOME SCHOOLS DON'T. END ADDITIONALLY THE THINGS THAT ARE PROPOSED IN THIS BUDGET ARE REALLY ABOUT SWITCHING OUT BUSES ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS AND THERE IS TALK OUT THERE AND JUSTICE LAST WEEK WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THERE'S A PROPOSAL TO SWITCH FROM EIGHTY EIGHT TO ENROLLMENT- WE TALKED ABOUT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR HEARING SO THAT WE'RE WE SHOULD HAVE A DISCUSSION THERE'S NOW PROPOSAL OUT THERE- HAPPENS TO BE BY THE CHAIR OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE SO MAYBE IT'LL HAVE LEGS. OUR OWN TO REALLY RESTORE THE MANDATE FOR HOME TO SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION FOR ALL THAT WE AS AND N. A. I'VE- INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH IT'S ESTIMATED THAT IT MIGHT COST THREE BILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS EXACTLY THE AMOUNT. OF THAT THE MOVING FROM A- EIGHTY EIGHT TO AN ENROLLMENT SYSTEM WOULD COST IF WE WERE TO HOLD SCHOOL DISTRICTS HARMLESS MY QUESTION IS PROBABLY FOR THE L. A. O. GIVEN THE OF FEW DISTRICTS THAT STILL DO WHAT ARE HOME TO SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION AT THE TWENTY TWELVE TO TWENTY THIRTEEN LEVEL. AND THE PROPOSALS THAT ARE IN THIS BUDGET FOR REPLACING MANDATE FOR COMPLETE HOME TO SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION HOW WOULD IT OVERLAY WITH THESE BUDGET PROPOSALS AT THE EXISTING BUDGET EXPENDITURES HOW WOULD IT FIT ALL TOGETHER HERE IF. IF WE WERE THE LEGISLATURE WERE TO DECIDE TO GO IN THAT DIRECTION. YEAH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN WE HAVEN'T DONE A COMPLETE- ABOUT THE FISCAL ANALYSIS. OF THAT BILL- S. B. THE PROPOSAL BY I SURE SKINNER BUT JUST FOR SUNDAY CONTEXT UNDER CURRENT LAW DISTRICTS DECIDE WHETHER TO PROVIDE HOME TO SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION. WHETHER THERE ARE ANY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA LIKE MINIMUM WALKING DISTANCE. OF THE MANIC SUBSTANCE DISABILITIES WHO SOMETIMES RECEIVE GUARANTEED TRANSPORTATION BASED ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL DISABILITY MISS. SO I UNDERSTANDING OF THIS BILL IS THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE DISTRICTS TO PROVIDE FREE TRANSPORTATION TO ALL STUDENTS IN KINDERGARTEN THROUGH GRADE SIX TO LIVE MORE THAN A HALF MILE AWAY FROM THEIR SCIENCE SCHOOL. AND ALL STUDENTS IN GRADES SEVEN TO TWELVE WITH MORE THAN ONE MILE AWAY I DISTRICTS COULD MEET THAT REQUIREMENTS BY PROVIDING TRANSPORTATION SCHOOL BUSES OR BY CONTRACTING WITH MUNICIPAL. TRANSIT AGENCIES TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE. NEW TO BE CONTAINED ON IF. STATE BY. THE CALIFORNIA OF FUNDING AS A READING AS A REIMBURSEMENT. AND ALLOCATED TO INDIVIDUAL DISTRICTS BASED PRIMARILY ON THE NUMBER OF MILES DRIVEN BY THE SCHOOL BUSES. IN THEIR FLEETS AND I THINK THE INTENT OF THIS PROGRAM IS THAT THIS NEW ALLOCATION FORMULA. I WOULD REPLACE THE EXISTING HOME TO SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION. ALLOTMENT TWITCHES WIDELY REFLECTIVE OF THE TYPE SIZE OF PROGRAMS THAT DISTRICTS WERE RUNNING. IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES UNDER THE PREVIOUS ITERATION OF THE PROGRAM. THANK YOU A APPRECIATE THAT AND- WHILE JUST LOOK AT THAT ASSIST. OVER THE NEXT FOUR MONTHS OF THAT COMPLETES MY QUESTIONS LET ME ASK MY COLLEAGUES IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON ISSUE NUMBER ONE. SENATOR MEANT. SO I JUST WANT TO FOLLOW ON SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT CHAIR THERE WAS ANYTHING EVER SO I WAS ONE- WHAT HOW MANY SCHOOL BUSES ARE THEIR IMPACT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MAYBE I MISSED THAT. IN OUR HAND OUT. AND WHO ARE YOU DIRECT TARGET BEAT ANYONE WHO KNOWS BUT IT PRESUMABLY IN PART IN EDUCATION. WELL I THINK TWO OF THEM ARE HOPING THAT THE THIRD ONE OF CFS QUESTION RIGHT BALK. HI MY- YEAH YEAH THANK YOU CENTER IN US. CURRENTLY BELIEVE BILL LATER INDICATE THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT PHONE ABOUT FIFTEEN. EIGHT HUNDRED BUSES AND PRIVATE CONTRACTORS SERVING SCHOOL DISTRICTS ON ANOTHER NINE THOUSAND OR SO BUSES SO- ROUGHLY TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND BUSES IN THE STATE BUT THAT FIFTEEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED OWNED BY SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE THE FOCUS OF THIS PROPOSAL. AND JUST A FOLLOW UP ON THAT THEN- MISTER CAP ACCOUNT. LOOKS ON THE PHONE SORRY- HOW MANY RIGHT NOW ARE LIKE TRICK OR ZERO EMISSIONS. RIGHT NOW ALL UNDER IS JUST OWN SEVERAL OF THOSE- STATEWIDE- WE DON'T HAVE A- EXACT NUMBER- PARTLY IT'S BECAUSE MANY DISTRICTS WE NO HAVE ORDERED- BUSES BUT HAVEN'T RECEIVED THEM YET SO THE NUMBER IS INCREASING ALL OF. YOU KNOW INCREASING. AS TIME GOES ON BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S JUST A COUPLE HUNDRED A STATEWIDE. NOW AND ANALYSIS THAT WE RECEIVE FROM LA- WHICH I TAKE ISSUE- WE- HAD IT SAID IT WAS ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND ROUGHLY FOR THE BUS PLUS CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR EACH NEW BUS. AND SO- I THINK IF WE DO THE MATH IT'S AT A HUNDRED FIFTY BUSES THAT'S WHAT WE GET FOR ONE POINT FIVE BILLION. SO THE WAY THE PROPOSAL IS CONSTRUCTED IS THAT ASSUMES THAT DISTRICTS WOULD SPEND ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND TO PURCHASE EACH BUS IN ANOTHER FIFTY THOUSAND HONEST CHARGING STATION. AT SEVEN FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND OKAY I THINK I MISSED READ THIS INSTEAD OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND I. THINK SOMEWHERE BUT SO IT'S LIKE LESSEN THAT SAYS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT THIRTY PLUS NO NO NO NO YOU'RE- DROPPING ZERO IN THERE SOMEWHERE. THREE ABOUT THREE THOUSAND. SO ELECTRIC. I'M SORRY YOUR OKAY. IT'S OKAY SO THAT'LL MAKE A FEEL THAT- AND I GUESS MY QUESTION YOU KNOW I'VE COUNTY TRANSIT. NOT SO LONG AGO. AND THEY WERE TELLING ME THEY WERE STILL. BETWEEN HYDROGEN ELECTRIC IN AND KIND OF. TAKEN SOME ELECTRIC AND SOME HYDROGEN. THIS PROPOSAL ENVISIONS THAT EVERYTHING WILL BE ELECTRIC. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WAS EXPRESSLY BY- CTAS JUST THAT THE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE IS SO EXPENSIVE AND SO- I DON'T KNOW IF IT CHANGES FOR SCHOOL BUSES SINCE YOU JUST HAVE SO FEWOF THEM- BUT- C. T. EXPRESSED TO ME THEY WOULD HAVE TO. INVEST SIGNIFICANTLY MASSIVE AMOUNTS TO TRY TO BUILD UP THE TYPE OF ELECTRICAL CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE THEY NEED TO. CONTINUOUSLY CHARGE THEIR BOSSES SO THAT THEY BE REGULAR REGULARLY A QUICK TO GO- YOU KNOW THERE'S CHALLENGES AND TRADEOFFS BETWEEN HYDROGEN AND ELECTRIC BUT- I WAS WONDERING IF. EITHER THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION COULD COMMENT ON THE DECISION TO. CHOOSE A LACK FOR IT ONLY AS OPPOSED TO ZERO EMISSIONS AS WE'VE OFTEN DONE IN. THIS- IN THE STATE. LENA GRANT PARK A FINANCE SO. THE WAY THAT THE- THE PROGRAMS CURRENTLY STRUCTURED AND PROPOSED IN THE TRAILER BILL. IS BUT PROVIDING FUNDING FOR THE OUTRIGHT REPLACING OF THE BUS THAT'S FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND AND THEN AN ADDITIONAL FIFTY THOUSAND FOR THE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE STATION. SO THAT WOULD COVER THE COST OF CHARGING THAT THE BUS SO- I'M NOT SURE IF MAYBE THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT. THE CURRENT INCENTIVE VOUCHER PROGRAM THAT EXISTS WITH THE CAR BECAUSE THAT IS THE PARTIAL COVERING UP THE COST. THAT'S WHAT OUT RIGHT PROVIDE FUNDING. FOR THE FULL ELECTRIC BUS REPLACEMENT. OKAY BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT INTERNET QUESTION I THINK MY QUESTIONIS WHY DID WE CHOOSE WE MADE A DECISION TO CHOOSE ELECTRIC AND NOT JUST SIMPLY DO ZERO EMISSIONS AS WE OFTEN HAVE DONE. AND GIVEN SORT OF WHAT I WAS TOLD WAS A VERY HIGH COST OF CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE I DON'T KNOW FIFTY THOUSAND IS THE RIGHT AMOUNT OR NOT- WHY DID WE MAKE THAT NORMATIVE CHOICE TO PREFERENCE ELECTRIC OVER. THE HYDROGEN. BUT WE BELIEVE A GREAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- WE WERE WE WERE LOOKING TO MAKE THAT KIND OF THE BIGGEST CLIMATE IMPACT POSSIBLE WITH THIS THIS FUNDING. AND GIVEN THE HIGH NUMBER OF- DIESEL BUSES THAT CURRENTLY OPERATE THE STATE YOU WANTED TO. WE WANTED TO MAKE THE- GREATEST IMPACT YOU KNOW HAVE THE DOLLAR GO THE FURTHEST SO THE ELECTRIC SCHOOL BUS OPTIONS SEEM TO. PROVIDE THAT- THAT OPPORTUNITY- SO THAT WAS OUR OUR KIND OF REASONING FOR GOING WITH ELECTRIC SCHOOL BUSES RATHER THAN ALLOWING. A VARIETY OF OTHERS AS SOME OTHER. INCENTIVE PROGRAMS TO. OKAY A BIT BECAUSE WHEN I TALK TO THEM AGAIN AND THIS IS JUST ONE DATA POINT BUT WHEN I TALK TO MY LOCAL. TRANSIT AUTHORITY DID EXPRESS ME THEY HAD CONCERNS ABOUT THE HIGH COST OF CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE ASSOCIATE WITH ELECTRIC. AND DEPENDING ON WHAT THE COST A HUNDRED AND WAS GOING TO BE IN A FEW YEARS HYDROGEN COULD END UP BEING A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE IT COULD BE CHEAPER BUT THE UP FRONT COST OF ELECTRIC WE'RE WE'RE QUITE HIGH IN THEIR VIEW. AND AGAIN I DON'T PRETEND TO BE AN EXPERT ON ALL THIS BUT- YOU KNOW WHEN THAT THE DECISION WE WANT TO DO IT MAKE IT A LOCAL LEVEL BASED ON AND THE PRICING AND DYNAMICS OF THE MARKET AT THE TIME RATHER THAN. I MEAN WHAT WHAT MAKING A PRETTY BIG DECISION HERE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TO SAY. ELECTRIC SCHOOL BUSES THE WAY TO GO IN MY UNDERSTANDING THE DEBATE WHEN IT COMES TO HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES SUCH AS BUSES IS THAT. IT'S NOT CLEAR WHICH TECHNOLOGIES BETTER WHICH ONE WILL BE MORE COST EFFECTIVE OVER THE LONG RUN. AND SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS SORT OF. WHAT WERE THE DATA POINTS OTHER THAN SORT OF I GUESS THE COST ONE WHICH I'M NOT SURE I FULLY UNDERSTAND- YEAH YOU KNOW WHAT WERE THE REASONS THAT WE CHOSE ELECTRIC. MORNING INTERNET AREA BERMAN FINANCE OKAY THERE I DON'T- SO JUST ANSWER THAT QUESTION CENTER MAN THE WAY I THINK OF IT IS WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO BE AS CONSISTENT AS POSSIBLE ACROSS SEVERAL OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS BOTH- PROPOSALS THAT WERE DONE- THAT FOR GRANT PROGRAMS ADMINISTERED BY THE A. R. B. AND- THE- ENERGY COMMISSION LAST YEAR AS WELL AS PROPOSALS IN THIS CURRENT GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT REALLY DO INTENT OVER ARCHING ON GOING AS FAR DOWN THE ROAD AS ELECTRIC VEHICLES AS WECAN AND YOU'RE SAYING THAT NOT JUST AND- YOU KNOW THE PUBLIC TRANSIT SECTOR- BUT ALL ACROSS RIGHT SEVERAL- INITIATIVES AND FOCUS ON ON. ELECTRIFYING VEHICLES WHETHER THAT BE FLEET VEHICLES OR OTHERWISE. AND THAT'S REALLY MORE- THE LANDS THAT WAS USED- WHEN WE WERE CRAFTING THIS PROPOSAL NOW THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT WE ARE COMPLETELY UNAWARE- CERTAINLY SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT YOU'RE MENTIONING- SOME OF THE YOU KNOW DIFFICULTIES PRACTICALLY WHETHER THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE DISTRCT AS- MAY BE MORAL OR HAS. A LONGER ROUTE THAN ONE AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE- WOULD BE ABLE TO DO REALISTICALLY WE WILL KEEP WILL WE ARE ENGAGING CONVERSATIONS TO TALK ABOUT SOME WAYS THAT. NO THERE IF THERE ARE TWEAKS NEEDED BUT AT THE MOMENT- THAT WAS THE LENS THAT WAS USED FOR THIS PROPOSAL. AND WE HAVE A HAND FROM THE L. A. SO BEFORE GOING BACK TO SENATOR MAN I'M GONNA RECOGNIZED. THE OHIO. AT THANK YOU SO TO SPEAK TO THAT- QUESTION SENATOR MAN WE GET THIS PART OF OUR REVIEW TOUGHEST DISTRICT IT BRINGS YOUR ELECTED PREVIOUS PROGRAM. AND A FULL SIZE ELECTRIC BUS A FAIRLY HIGH AND TRY STATE. A FOUR HUNDRED DOLLAR FOR THE ELECTED SCHOOL BUS FIFTY THOUSAND TRYING TO STATION SEEMS TO BE. ABOUT WHAT THE MARK PROCESS RIGHT NOW ARE UNDER THOUGH THEY IS JUST DOWN. THE COSTA TRANSIT MY PAY THEIR IS A BIT DIFFERENT FROM THE BUS AND IT'S CHARGING FOR STRUCTURE. AND AS FAR AS THE BUST. WE ARE THE HAS TO IT LIKE US HYDROGEN FUEL. BASED FOR SCHOOL THAT AS FAR AS WE KNOW ELECT. SCHOOL BUS LIKE TO SCHOOL BUSES ARE THE ONLY KIND OF ZERO VEHICLE THAT GONNA COMMERCIALLY FOR YOUR IN RIGHT NOW. THAT'S VERY HELPFUL THERE ARE SOME OTHER. THAT ARE TO OUR JUST. THOSE CHECKS OF VEHICLES INCLUDING THE ONE THAT WAS CREATED IN YEAR'S BY AND- BUT- THAT I THINK WAS WHAT I CASE. TO DIMINISH MUST WHAT TYPE OF THE- COULD BE FOR. IMPLEMENT RIGHT NOW THAT'S VERY HELP HELP ANSWERS ON- IF THERE ARE NO HYDROGEN FUEL CELL. THE THAN YOU REALLY PER ANYTHING I APPRECIATE ANSWER I DO HAVE CONCERNS THAT WE ARE CREATING A MARKET. AND WE'RE PUSHING OURSELVES ON A PATH WHERE IT RATHER THAN LETTING THE MARKET SORT ITSELF OUT- YEAH YOU KNOW WHAT ONE THING THAT WAS STRIKING TO ME I RECENTLY VISITED UC IRVINE'S. TRANSPORTATION INSTITUTE. AND ONE THING THEY TOLD ME WAS JUST THAT IF WE TAKE ALL THE KNOWN LITHIUM AND COBALT IN THE IN THE WORLD. IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO MEET OUR ANYWHERE CLOSE TO A SMALL FRACTION OF OUR OUR BATTERY NEEDS AND THAT WAS STRIKING TO ME IN ADDITION TO THE PROBLEMS OF WHAT WE DO WITH THESE BATTERIES WHEN THEY RUN OFF. AND I DO HAVE CONCERNS WERE PUSHING REALLY HARD IN THE ELECTRIC SPACE WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT THE LONG TERM IMPLICATIONS FOR- WHETHER THAT'S SUSTAINABLE BUT- I APPRECIATE YOUR ANSWERS AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SENATOR MENSEN RITUAL BOKE. I JUST HAVE TO REACH AT ECHO SENATOR MEN'S- COMMENTS THIS MORNING BECAUSE I ACTUALLY HAVE HAD THE SAME CONCERNS- THAT YOU JUST EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR SHARING- IN ASKING THOSE QUESTIONS. I'M I ALSO WANTED TO SORT OF ASK A QUESTION WITH REGARDS TO- THE- ELECTRIC READ AND THE ABILITY FOR US TO BE ABLE TO. ASK THE SAME THESE pBUSES ARE BE ABLE TO TRUST THEM AND WHAT THE COST WILL BE EVENTUALLY FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND JUST AS- JUST IN GENERAL- IF WE TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION ABOUT THE ELECTRIC RATE AND OUR ABILITY TO- TO SUPPORT OUR BUSES. AND STEPPED VOTER- THAT WE PROBABLY BE FOUR- THE DEPARTMENT OF FINE- GOOD MORNING AGAIN IN A AN APARTMENT OF FINANCE I THINK AS FAR AS THAT QUESTION- SENSE UNFORTUNATELY ONE OF THE MORE- TRANSPORTATION- KIND OF INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES LIKE THAT FALL OUTSIDE OF MY AREA AND MY COLLEAGUE LINA'S AREA WITH EDUCATION I DON'T KNOW THAT I COULD SPEAK WITH A WHOLE LOT OF EXPERTISE ON THE SUBJECT- I DO KNOW. RIGHT EVEN THOSE ARE VALID QUESTIONS CONCERNS I THINK FROM MINISTRATIONS PERSPECTIVE WE I LOOK AT IT AS WHERE YOU'RE REALLY TRYING TO PLAY THE LONG GAME IN TERMS OF SETTING- THE STATE UP FOR SUCCESS BASED YOU KNOW CONVERTING THERE STILL BY CONVERTING DIESELS TO ELECTRIC ZERO EMISSIONS THERE ARE STILL SO MANY DIESEL BUSES AND CAN USE INSERT IN CIRCULATION IN THE STATE AND THAT HAS BOTH YOU KNOW REAL IMPACTS FOR. THE HEALTH OF STUDENTS AS WELL AS THE HEALTH OF THE ENVIRONMENT OBVIOUSLY- AND SO IT'S REALLY ABOUT- PRIORITIZING THAT- AND RECOGNIZING AT THE SAME TIME THAT OUR PARTNERS- AT THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES WHETHER IT'S- THEIR RESOURCES BOARD OR WHOEVER ELSE IN THAT SPACE OF REALIZING THAT OUR PARTNERS TO HAVE A BIG TASK AHEAD OF THEM WHEN IT COMES TO- COMBATING SOME OF THOSE OTHER CONCERNS WHETHER IT BE INFRASTRUCTURE OR LIKE YOU SAID COSTS TO. SCHOOL DISTRICTS I WOULD NOTE THAT YOU KNOW OUR HOPE OR INTENT WITH THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT- IN THE LONG TERM BECAUSE DIESEL BUSES CAN BE SO MUCH ORE COSTLY TO MAINTAIN- THAT IN THE LONG TERM SCHOOLS WOULD SEE SAVINGS FROM FROM AS A RESULT OF- ELECTRIFYING THEIR FLEETS AND THAT WAS REALLY A LOT OF THINKING BEHIND BEING ABLE TO PAY THE FULL COST OF THE BUS OF ELECTRIC BUS. CONVERSION IN THIS CASE SUCH THAT- THE STATE IS TAKING THE BRUNT OF THAT BURDEN TO PROVIDE THE BUS AND THEN THE DISTRICT COULD REALIZE COST SAVINGS FROM THE OTHER PIECES OF OWNING ELECTRIC BUS ROUTES THE DIESEL BUS- IN IN THE MORNING HERE- LONG TERM SO. THAT'S HELPFUL I DON'T KNOW IF MY COLLEAGUE AT THE ALIENS ANYTHING ELSE AT ALL I WAS JUST GONNA SAY. MISTER IDEA DID VERY WELL WITH HAVE HAVING LIMIT DECKS FOR. AND I'M AND PRE MR IT IT IT IT THE YOUR YOUR FEE ON THAT I THINK. I THINK WHAT I'M GOING BACK TO IS BASICALLY. AS MY COLLEAGUE STATED EARLIER WE ARE DIRECTING THESE FUNDS TO WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO ENVISIONED THOUGH I THE INTENT AYE AT THE MERIT OF IT IS JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF MAYBE PERHAPS EVEN A LITTLE FLEXIBILITY IN IN THE- IN ALLOWING OUR LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS DECIDE. HOW TO HOW TO PROCEED WITH AB ACQUIRING THESE VEHICLES WHAT WOULD BE BEST FOR THEM LOCALLY- IN WHETHER OR NOT IT'S ELECTRIC VEHICLE OR ELECTRIC BUS OR IF IT IS THEIR EMISSIONS- BUS- SCENARIO SO. THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S WHERE I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AS TO MAYBE PERHAPS GIVING A LITTLE FLEXIBILITY TO OUR LOCAL SCHOOL WOULD WORK BEST BOTH A- AND- WITH INFRASTRUCTURE- WITHIN THEIR THEIR- THEIR CAPACITIES WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITY SO THAT'S JUST THE CONCERN THAT I AM HAVING- WITH REGARDS TO SAY COULD THIS IS RICHARD WITH THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GIVING YOU THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE AND JUST MAKING A VERY. LEAN YOU'RE A VERY STRUCTURED- SO JUST A LITTLE BIT IT JUST WANTING A SEAT THERE. GREAT- DO YOU HAVE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS ON. YEAH MAKE A COMMENT. CENTER MILL YEAH I DON'T WANT TO TAKE MY EARLIER COMMENTS BE TAKING AS A CRITICISM OF THIS PROJECT I'M VERY MUCH IN FAVOR OF- ELECTRIFIED AND GET MOVING IS YOUR EMISSIONS AND- THIS SEEMS LIKE A WORTHWHILE USE OF OUR FUNDS PARTICULAR TIME WHEN THIS ONE ACT MOST OF THIS AS I UNDERSTAND WILL NOT COUNT AGAINST AGAIN LINDA SO I APPLAUD DEPARTMENT FINANCE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION FOR- THIS APPROACH AND- I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING IT RIGHT. REALLY DO APPRECIATE. THE DIRECTIONALITY THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL HERE. THE YOU. ARE AND- A. I. WE'VE REYES. LOTS OF ISSUES HERE BUT GOOD ONES AND THINGS TO THINK ABOUT OVER THE NEXT MONTHS AS WE MARCH TOWARD THE MAY REVISE. SO WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO. AND THANK OUR PANELISTS WHO WERE HERE FOR ISSUE NUMBER ONE. THE ISSUE NUMBER TWO IS NUTRITION. AND OUR PANEL IS ALEK SHOPE FROM THE DEPARTMENT AMY LEE FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE KIM FRIENDS L. FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND WE'RE GONNA GO IN THAT ORDER- SO WE'LL BEGIN WITH OUR TROOP WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AND MEMBERS ALLEN CHAU PARTNERS FINANCE- IT IS THE PRIORITY OF THE ADMINISTRATION TO ADDRESS ISSUES AND FOOD AND NUTRITION SECURITY- ENCOURAGE HEALTHY DIETS AND ESTABLISH A CLIMATE SMART SCHOOL FOOD SUPPLY BUDGET BILL OFF OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET INVESTMENTS AND COMMITMENTS TO- IMPLEMENT UNIVERSAL BILLS. SO SPECIFICALLY- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY SIX MILLION- ONGOING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO IMPLEMENT THE UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MEALS PROGRAM- THAT WAS INCLUDED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET AT. THIS IS IN ADDITION TO FIFTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS- WHAT NINETY GENERAL FUND PROVIDED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET FOR A TOTAL. ADDITIONAL ANNUAL UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MEALS BESSNER OF SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. THIS AMOUNT IS BASED ON. ALL MEALS AT THE FEDERAL THREE RATE- WILL END AT THE END OF JUNE TWENTY TWENTY TWO- AN AMOUNTS TO A TOTAL STATE INVESTMENT OF ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE STATE BILL PROGRAM- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES COMPLIMENTARY INVESTMENTS TO THE ROLL OUT. OF UNIVERSAL BILLS- THIS INCLUDES FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION. ONE TIME PROP NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO PROVIDE SCHOOL KITCHEN INFRASTRUCTURE GRANTS- TO INCREASE LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES CAPACITY TO PROVIDE FRESH AND NUTRITIOUS CLASS WILL MEALS. IN ANTICIPATION OF UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MEALS IMPLEMENTATION- ALLOWABLE USES FOR THIS FUNDING. PURCHASES OF COOKING EQUIPMENT SERVICE EQUIPMENT REFRIGERATION AND STORAGE- TRANSPORTATION FACILITY UPGRADES AND TRAINING FOR YOU TO SERVICE STAFF- THE BUDGET ALSO PROPOSES AN ADDITIONAL THREE MILLION DOLLARS PROP NINETY GENERAL FUND. FOR THE SCHOOL BREAKFAST AND SUMMER MEALS PROGRAM START UP GRANTS PROGRAM- FOUR EIGHT BUDGET YOUR TOTAL OF FOUR POINT ZERO ONE SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. THESE FUNDS ARE INTENDED TO ALSO BE ABLE TO REIMBURSE COSTS INCURRED IN THE CURRENT YEAR TO ENCOURAGE SCHOOLS TO IMPLEMENT- OR EXPANDED BREAKFAST PROGRAMS IN PREPARATION FOR UNIVERSITY YES- AND THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS AND HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE. TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WILL MOVE TO THE LOWER. ANALYST'S OFFICE. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR SENATORS IN NEARLY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO THIS MORNING WE WANTED TO SHARE OUR ASSESSMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON FEW OF THE GOVERNOR'S SCHOOL NUTRITION PROPOSALS SPECIFICALLY THE FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY SIX MILLION DOLLAR AUGMENTATION FOR SCHOOL MEALS AND THE FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME FUNDING FOR ADDITIONAL KITCHEN INFRASTRUCTURE AND TRAINING GRANTS. FIRST ON THE AUGMENTATION WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE PROPOSED APPLICATION THIS AUGMENTATION IS ALIGNED WITH TRAILER LEGISLATION FROM THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET PACKAGE REQUIRING THAT BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE ALL CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS ARE REQUIRED TO SERVE UNIVERSAL MEALS AND FOR UNIVERSAL MEALS WE NEED PROVIDING ONE FREE BREAKFAST AND LUNCH FREE LUNCH PER SCHOOL DAY ANY STUDENT AT RISK THAT IS REQUESTING A MEAL. SO THAT IS ON AUGMENTATION- THE REMAINDER OF MY COMMENTS REALLY FOCUS ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO FIND ADDITIONAL KITCHEN INFRASTRUCTURE IN TRAINING GRANTS. ON THIS POLLS WILL BE. THE LEGISLATURE UP A REDUCED AMOUNT OF ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR ADDITIONAL KITCHEN INFRASTRUCTURE IN TRAINING GRANTS. THIS IS ONE THIRD OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED AMOUNT BUT IT MATCHES THE AMOUNT THAT WAS PROVIDED IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. THE PRIMARY REASON THAT WE RECOMMEND APPROVING A REDUCED AMOUNT IS BECAUSE THE STATE REALLY DOESN'T HAVE A CLEAR SENSE AS TO THE TOTAL COST OF KITCHEN INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES. ASSOCIATED WITH UNIVERSAL MEALS AT THIS TIME ESPECIALLY SINCE THE STATE ALREADY PROVIDED FUNDING FOR THE SAME ACTIVITIES IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO PERCENT. WE EXPECT THAT SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WILL BE AVAILABLE AFTER JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY THREE EIGHT WHICH IS WHEN ELOISE MUST REPORT HOW IT USED THE FIRST ROUND OF FINDING. WE ALSO RECOMMEND PRIORITIZING CAN THIS FUNDING FOR IMPLEMENTING UNIVERSAL MEALS RATHER THAN INCORPORATION OF FRESH FOODS- SCRATCH COOKING. SCHOOLS WILL HAVE TO MANAGE A VARIETY OF NEAR TERM CHALLENGES FOR THEIR SCHOOL INTERESTING PROGRAMS INCLUDING UNIVERSAL MEALS STAFFING SHORTAGES AND INCREASED COSTS FOR FOOD AND EQUIPMENT. FOR THESE REASONS WE BELIEVE THAT EDUCATIONAL FUNDING FOR SCRATCH COOKING TO BE SOMEWHAT PREMATURE AT THIS TIME. WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE COULD REVISIT FUNDING FOR BOTH UNIVERSAL MEALS AND SCRATCH COOKING IN FUTURE YEARS WANTS MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE DEMAND AND THE USE OF THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO GRANTS BECOME AVAILABLE. LASTLY THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER MODIFYING THE FORMULA FOR THE GRANTS TO TARGET DISTRICTS THAT ARE MOST IMPACTED BY UNIVERSAL MEALS. THE GOVERNOR'S COALS ALL ALLOCATE A PORTION OF FUNDING TO DISTRICTS WITH AT LEAST 30% OF STUDENTS QUALIFYING FOR FREE OR REDUCED PRICE MEALS. THIS APPROACH LIKELY EXCLUDES SOME DISTRICTS THAT WILL NEED TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE CAPACITY TO SERVE UNIVERSAL MEALS. SPECIFICALLY THOSE THAT CURRENTLY DO NOT OFFER A SCHOOL LUNCH AND OR SCHOOL BREAKFAST. AND THOSE WITH LOWER SHARES OF STUDENTS QUALIFYING FOR FREE OR REDUCEDPRICE MEALS. TO ENSURE A SMOOTHER IMPLEMENTATION THE LEGISLATURE. COULD CONSIDER ALLOCATING FUNDING BASED ON SOME OF COMPOUND NEED. SUCH AS A PART JUST UNDER. MEALS COMPARED TO SOME PRIOR BASICALLY LEVEL. THAT CONCLUDES MY TESTIMONY BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENTS WILL MOVE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. GIVE GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CAN FRIENDS AL DIRECTOR OF NUTRITION SERVICES WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. AND TODAY I'M TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TONY THURMOND. THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IS GRATEFUL FOR THE INVESTMENTS ON SCHOOL MEALS ENSURING ALL STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO BOTH THE NUTRITIOUS BREAKFAST. AND LUNCH EACH SCHOOL DAY. THIS INVESTMENT TRULY ELEVATES THE IMPORTANCE OF HEALTHY SCHOOL MEALS. AND BRING SHOWS THAT SCHOOL MALES ARE VITAL ELEMENT TO IT STUDENTS EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE. IT ALSO PROVIDES ELLIE AS WITH THE FINANCIAL RESPITE TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. STEADIES OF LONG CONFIRMED THAT THERE'S INCREASED PARTICIPATION AND SCHOOL MEALS FROM ALL STUDENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR ECONOMIC STATUS WHEN MALES ARE MADE AVAILABLE AT NO COST FOR ALL. AND SADLY THE PANDEMIC HAS TRULY REVEALED JUST HOW ESSENTIAL SCHOOL MEAL PROGRAMS ARE IN COMBATING FOOD INSECURITY ACROSS ALL ECONOMIC LEVELS FOR OUR STUDENTS- DECADES CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A NATIONAL LEADER AND ESTABLISHING GREATER ACCESS FOR SCHOOL MEALS. BUT IT DEPARTMENT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS- PROVIDED HIGHLIGHTS OF THIS YEAR'S INVESTMENTS FOR UNIVERSAL MEALS AND IT REALLY DOES SET UP OUR SCHOOLS FOR GREATER SUCCESS IN IMPLEMENTING A SUSTAINABLE UNIVERSAL MALES PROGRAM. THE DESIGN OF THE CALIFORNIA UNIVERSAL MAIL PROGRAM IS VERY INTENTIONAL AND IT'S INTENDED TO SUPPLEMENT NOT SUPPLANT THE FEDERL MAIL REIMBURSEMENT SO THAT WE CAN MAXIMIZE THE FULL AMOUNT OF FEDERAL FUNDING. THE FULL ON THE PROPOSED FOUR HUNDRED AND MILLION FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE KITCHEN AFTER STRUCTURE AND TRAINING ALLOCATION FORMULA. HONORS THE NEEDS OF OUR ALLEY AS- AND IT REALLY TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THAT NOT ALL SCHOOLS ARE THE SAME. AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER A SCHOOL HAS A VERY HIGH PERCENTAGE OF PRE REDUCED PRICE STUDENT ELIGIBILITY OR LOW OR MODERATE THEY HAVE UNIQUE NEEDS AND SCHOOLS NAY THE OPTIONS AND THE CHOICE AND HOW TO USE THESE VALUABLE RESOURCES. THE FUNDING ALLOCATION ALLOW SCHOOLS TO IMPLEMENT AND EXPAND SERVICES FOR UNIVERSAL MALES AND INNOVATIVE WAYS THAT MEET THEIR NEEDS. WHETHER THAT IS INVESTING IN MORE SCRATCH COOKING WHETHER IT IS CREATING MORE POINT OF SERVICE OPTIONS EXTENDING MILL TIMES OFFERING BREAKFAST- MODELS THAT MIGHT BE. DIFFERENT THAN THEY HAVE IN THE PAST DEVELOPING THEIR STAFF SKILL SETS PURCHASED A NEW EQUIPMENT REPAIRING OR PLUMBING ELECTRICAL NEEDS FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE CAFETERIA AND KITCHEN. THE RESPONSE TO THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO KITCHEN EFFORTS DR FUNDS. HAVE BEEN VERY POSITIVE WE ARE HEARING FROM SCHOOLS THAT THEIR NEEDS WILL BE ONGOING ESPECIALLY OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. AS WE COME OUT OF THE PANDEMIC CONTINUE TO DEAL WITH THE SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES AND ALSO- ADDRESS DECLINING STUDENT ENROLLMENT. SO OF THE ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN ELEAZAR WERE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THIS YEAR'S FUNDING FOR THE KITCHEN AT THE STRUCTURE TRAINING FUNDS. NINETY FOUR RIGHT JUST 94% REGISTERED FOR THESE BONDS SEVEN NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY ALLEY AS- AND WE ARE CURRENTLY PARTNERING WITH UC BERKELEY NUTRITION POLICY INSTITUTE SURVEY OUR FOOD SERVICE DIRECTORS ON UNIVERSAL MEALS. IT'S A PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY THAT WILL COLLECT CONCERNS NEEDS IMPORTANT- DATASETS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO SUSTAIN UNIVERSAL MILLS IN THE COMING YEARS. AND WE'VE JUST RELEASED A SURVEY BUT JESSICA AS OF LAST WEEK OVER A HUNDRED EIGHTY HAVE COMPLETED THE SURVEY AND THERE ANOTHER HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN IN PROGRESS SO WE'LL HAVE MORE RESULTS TO SHARE IN MID MARCH SO IN CLOSING CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO LEAD THE WAY. AND LONG TERM INVESTMENTS FOR THE OVERALL HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF OUR STUDENTS AND THEIR ACADEMIC SUCCESS WE APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT AN ONGOING FUNDING OF UNIVERSAL MALES AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND- LEGISLATURE ON THE KITCHEN INFRASTRUCTURE PROPOSAL. THANK YOU AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. ONE OF THE WEIRD ONE I NOTICED THAT YOU OF A CANDLE BURNING IN THE BACKGROUND IS THAT AROMATHERAPY IS AT WHAT'S HELPING YOU TESTIFY. I KNOW IT'S NOT THANK YOU OKAY WELL I JUST THOUGHT THAT. THE L. A. O. IN THE FINANCE ARE LISTENING CLOSELY IN CASE THEY NEED TO FOLLOW THE LEAD SO. I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AND I'M- EGGMAN MAYBE I'LL START WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND GO TO FINANCER OF THE L. A. L. AND THAT'S IT LAST YEAR. WHEN WE WERE HAVING THE HEARING ON THIS EXACT SAME TOPIC- MOST OF THE SCHOOLS ACROSS CALIFORNIA CLOSED THE NUTRITION PROGRAMS HAD PLUNGED AND USAGE THERE WERE SOME- SOME SCHOOLS THAT WERE MAKING A VALIANT EFFORT TO GET FOOD OUT. AND HAVE THEIR STUDENTS EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE CLOSE COMBINED PICK IT UP AND- AND THERE'S NO REFERENCE CLEARLY IN THE STAFF REPORT TO WHETHER OR NOT OF THE MALES IN THE PROGRAMS HAVE COME BACK TOTALLY AS SCHOOLS HAVE REOPENED WHAT'S THE STATUS. OR THE NUMBERS WHERE THEY WERE PRE PANDEMIC AND PEOPLE. ARE USING MALES AT SCHOOLS AND I DON'T KNOW WHO WANTS TO TAKE THAT FIRST LET'S START WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND SEE IF THE OTHERS WISH TO COMMENT. SHARES THANK YOU CAN CONSULT APARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND- UNFORTUNATELY NO THE NUMBERS HAVE NOT REBOUND AS OF YET- WERE STILL FUNCTIONING UNDER A HUNDRED SIXPENCE A VERS BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT. MAIL COUNTS IN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY NINETEEN PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC TWO LET'S JUST TAKE BREAKFAST COUNTS IN SEPTEMBER FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE THEY ARE DOWN ABOUT TWO POINT. NINE MILLION MEALS THAT WE ARE- UNDER SERVING PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC AND I'M SORRY BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES THERE'S APPLES TO APPLES YOU DON'T ROUGHLY WHAT THE PERCENT OF TOTAL MALE STATUS SO THAT WE HAVE. A CONTEXT WHERE JOHN CENTER 20% LIKE WHAT'S THE BIG DROP OFF WITH THAT NUMBER OF NAMES. IT'S I WOULD HAVE TO RUN THE NUMBERS TO GIVE YOU THAT THE PERCENT CHANGE BUT IT HAS- IT HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT DROP. OKAY AND AT THE TIME WE WERE DOING THIS LAST YEAR THERE WERE EMERGENCY FUNDS. GOING TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND I THINK THEY WERE SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE RIGHT ABOUT THE TIME THE SCHOOL YEAR STARTED TODAY EXPIRE OR THEIR CONTINUING EMERGENCY FUNDS TO DISTRICTS ARE WE DONE WITH THAT RIGHT NOW. YEAH THERE'S BEEN SEVERAL FEDERAL FUNDING OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO SCHOOLS AND SO THERE WERE SOME AS HER FRIENDS THAT WENT OUT AND THOSE HAVE BEEN EXPENDED. AND THEN IN ADDITION- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RELEASED THE EMERGENCY COST REIMBURSEMENT SO THAT PROVIDED A FUNDING ALLOCATIONS OF THOSE HAVE HAVE GONE OUT. AND THEN- THEY JUST RELEASED A SUPPLY CHAIN FUNDING AMOUNT THAT WE WILL ARE IN THE PROCESS OF ALLOCATING OUT TO SCHOOLS TO HELP. WITH THE LOSS AND THE INCREASE IN FOOD. COSTS AND SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES THEY'RE STILL MONEY COMING JUST NOT IN THE SAME CATEGORY SO IT WAS COMING AT THE HEART OF THE PANDEMIC CORRECT. AND THEN. WITH EXCUSE ME WE HAVE BEEN TALKING IN THE THROUGH THE PANEL IN THE STAFF REPORT ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF WHAT FOR CALLING UNIVERSAL MEALS AND I KNOW THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT AUGMENTATION MADE LAST YEAR. IS IT TOO EARLY TO KNOW EXACTLY- HOW THAT'S BEING IMPLEMENTED AND WHETHER IT'S WHILE WITH WHETHER THE SCHOOLS ARE FAILING THEMSELVES OF THAT. THEN MAYBE WE'LL START WITH THE OF. THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND SEE IF OTHERS WISH TO HAVE. I'M SORRY- MISTER SHERMAN CAN YOU REPEAT THAT IT'S BASICALLY THAT THE UNIVERSAL MALES WAS CREATED. DO WE UNDERSTAND HOW SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTATION S. B. YES- UNDER THE FEDERAL WAIVERS THEY HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL AND THAT- THE SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO- TO CONTINUE TO DO NON CONGREGATE WHICH TRADITIONALLY IS NOT. AN OPTION AND- AS WELL AS OFFERING- THAT BALK FOODS IN DOING AND DIFFERENT CHOICES SO YES. IT HAD THE UNIVERSAL MALES HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL UNDER THE FEDERAL- PROVISIONS OF THE PANDEMIC AND WHEN YOU SAY NON CONGREGATE WHAT DOES IT MEAN IN THE TERMS OF THIS PROFILE I KNOW CONTRA MEANS EVERYBODY SITS IN THE CAFETERIA. LUNCH AND NOT CONGREGATE TO SOMETHING ELSE WHAT DOES IT MEAN. YES THE NON CONGER GET. WOULD MEAN THAT THAT THE STUDENTS ARE TAKING THE MALES HOME THEY'RE NOT CONSUMING THEM ON CAMPUS. OKAY THANK. ARM OF OTHER QUESTIONS BUT I REALLY WANT TO GIVE MY COLLEAGUES A CHANCE AND SO LET ME ASK SENATOR TROUBLED YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THE SIDE. YES SO- IT KIND OF FOLLOWS THE PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT SENATOR SKINNER- MOVE FORWARD LAST YEAR WITH REGARDS TO. TRYING TO HAVE ARE IMPLEMENTED A UNIVERSAL MEALS- THROUGH OUR TO OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM. AND ONE OF THE COMMENT THAT ONE OF THE COMMENTS THAT SHE MADE- AT OUR IN OUR COMMITTEE WAS. THE FACT THAT WE WEREN'T MAXIMIZING THE MATCHING FUNDS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO MY QUESTION IS MORE OF A WITH THE PROGRAM IS THAT WE ARE- PROPOSING RIGHT NOW WITH THE BUDGET- THEY WERE PROPOSING RIGHT NOW. WITH THAT MAXIMIZE THE MATCHING FUNDS FROM THE FEDERAL. GOVERNMENT. EL SHOW DEPARTMENT FINANCE- I THINK THAT AS PART OF- ONE THING OF YOU KNOW COUPLE THINGS THAT HIGHLIGHT AS PART OF UNIVERSAL NEEDLES PLANTATION- IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FROM LAST YEAR- WHAT WE REQUIRED ALL- ELEAZAR THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE COMMUNITY- ELIGIBILITY PROVISION TO- ENROLL IN THIS PROGRAM OR ONE OF THE OTHER OTHER- FEDERAL PROVISIONS- YOU KNOW BY THE- BEGINNING. OF THE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE SCHOOL YEAR. IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO MAXIMIZE. THE FEDERAL FUNDS TO SUPPORT THAT COMES FROM BEING. A PART OF THOSE PROGRAMS- I MIGHT DIFFER I GUESS TO MY COLLEAGUE AT- CD E. S. R. AS AS FAR AS- EDUCATION- AT THE LOCAL LEVEL OF ANY OTHER EFFORTS TO- TO. EXCISES FEDERAL FUNDS BUT YOU KNOW WE IT IS OUR INTENTION I OUR DESIRE FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND SCHOOLS TO CONTINUE TO- YOU KNOW COLLECT COLLECT- YOU KNOW THE STUFF FREE AND REDUCED PRICE NO FORMS AND YET BE ABLE TO MAXIMIZE THE FUNDING. FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN THAT REGARD AS WELL. DO YOU WANT OTHER STATES I THINK SHE I THINK HE HAD SOMEONE ELSE THAT WANTED O. BORDERS CDP WISHES TO. F. ED TO THAT DISCUSSION. NOBODY'S MOVING SO I'M GATHERING THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD. CENTER SO ONE LAST QUESTION AND- THIS WAR- MONTHS CA FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THE PROPOSING FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR SCHOOL KITCHEN INFRASTRUCTURE. AND WE UNDERSTAND BASED ON OUR PAST COUPLE MEETINGS- WE'VE COME TO QUITE THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS THAT ARE- WE'RE HAVING IN IN HIGHER EDUCATION THAT WHICH IS IN THE BILLIONS. JUST KIND OF CURIOUS AS TO WHY FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR SCHOOL KITCHEN INFRASTRUCTURE. SURE THIS IS THE- SORT OF PROCESS- I THINK THAT YOU KNOW AS AS- I MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IT NOTED EARLIER- YOU KNOW THERE IS A NEW ENTRY ROBUST AND THE CURRENT YEAR FOUR- D. THE- KITCHEN INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDS- YOU KNOW AND WE SEE THAT AS SORT OF A CONTINUING. ONGOING NEED- I THINK WE WANTED TO BE ABLE. TO YOU KNOW TAKE ADVANTAGE- AND UTILIZE. THE BAILABLE- ONE TIME RESOURCES- TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND- THIS PROGRAM- MAKE MAKE THIS FUNDING. FOR IMPACTFUL FOR MORE- FOR MORE ELEAZAR- ESPECIALLY. SORT OF NOTING A LOT OF THESE NEEDS- THAT THAT YOU KNOW THAT SCHOOLS HAVE AS AS THEY THEY KIND OF MOVED TOWARDS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A PERSON FEELS. SO ONE LAST QUESTION HOW DID. WE ARRIVE AT THE FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. MARK. I GUESS AS FAR AS THE SPECIFIC SIZE I THINK WE JUST WANTED TO YOU KNOW BE ABLE TO USE THE AVAILABLE ONE TIME RESOURCES- UNDERSTANDING YOU KNOW DAD'S- FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION THAT HAS ALLOWED US TO. EXPAND THIS PROGRAM- AND IN A FEW DIFFERENT WAYS- THE WHILE WE CAN YEAH EXPANDED THE SPACE ALLOCATION FOR ANY SCHOOL THAT OPS IN- FROM TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND- WE HAVE LOWERED THE FREE AND REDUCED PRICE MEALS THRESHOLDS- FOR THE FIRST PART OF THE DISAPPOINTING FROM FIFTY PERCENT- 230% WHICH I THINK FROM SOME OF THE INITIAL DATA WE ST WORK. WHAT AN INCREASE IN ELIGIBILITY- BY ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT- LIAISE ARE OFTEN- AND THEN YEAH FINALLY THIS STATE INCREASED ABOUT IT ALSO- MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO PROVIDE THE SECOND PART OF THIS NO FUNDING- FOR ELEAZAR THAT. ARE YOU KNOW WILL COMMIT TO SERVING AT LEAST SCRATCH OR SPEED SCRATCH BEGINNING- IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND FOUR. BECAUSE THAT THE COMPLETE YOUR QUESTIONS YES THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU SENATOR MAN. I JUST WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON MY COLLEAGUES QUESTIONS- CAN I THREE SCHOOL AGE KIDS IN- AS I SAID BEFORE THE PLURAL OF ANECDOTE IS NOT DATA AND I'M VERY WELL AWARE THAT BUT I DO WANT TO DESCRIBE THEIR EXPERIENCES. FOR MOST OF LAST YEAR WITH THE RECEIVE FOR THEIR LUNCH WHICH THERE IS A VERY EXCITED TO GET WAS LITERALLY TWO PIECES OF BREAD AND A PIECE OF MEAT- AND WHEN WE ASKED ABOUT WHY THAT WAS THE CASE FOR MOST OF LAST YEAR SCHOOL YEAR. I WAS BECAUSE OF STAFFING AND A LACK LACK OF KITCHEN RESOURCES. THIS YEAR I'M TOLD IT'S GOTTEN A LITTLE BETTER OCCASIONALLY THEY HAVE PIZZA OR SOME OTHER OPTION BUT IT'S- BY AND LARGE THE SAME ON SENATOR- SHOWBOATS QUESTION. WHY ADD MORE MONEY WHEN THERE'S CLEARLY AT LET IT SEEMS IN AND THIS SEEMS TO BE AT I'VE MAYBE I SHOULD ADD PHRASES IN THE FORM OF A QUESTION. IT IS MY- CHILDREN'S EXPERIENCE. UNIQUE OR IS THAT SOMETHING WE'RE SEEING IS- BOTTLENECK. AND IN TALKING WITH SOME DIFFERENT TEACHERS GROUPS OUT THERE. AND SCHOOL WORKERS. IT DAVE EXPRESSED ME SOME SIMILAR CONCERNS THAT THERE IS A BOTTLENECK. THERE'S NOT ENOUGH STAFF THERE'S NOT ENOUGH KITCHEN RESOURCES. TO PREPARE THE TYPES OF MEALS THAT WE'D LIKE TO HAVE FOR UNIVERSAL MEALS. AND SO I APPLAUD THIS PROGRAM I THINK IT'S REALLY GREAT BUT OUR OUR THE RESOURCES THERE AND IF TO REALLY KIND OF MAKE THIS- YOU KNOW HOLISTIC IN THE WAYS THAT YOU WERE ENVISIONING. AND IF NOT THEN WHY NOT DEFAULT TO SOME OF THE ALEJO'S RIET RECOMMENDATIONS OF SCALING IT BACK TO THOSE ALLEY AS- THAT NEED IT THE MOST RATHER THAN MAKING IT TRULY UNIVERSAL- AND I'M I'M ALL IN FAVOR UNIVERSAL LUNCHES UNIVERSAL MEALS I THINK THIS IMPORTANT- MORAL SIGNAL BUT BUT- IF WE CAN'T WRAP THIS UP. AND ALSO WE CAN'T SUSTAIN THE STAFF THAT WE NEED TO REALLY KEEP IT GOING. OVER ON AN ONGOING BASIS- YOU KNOW IF WERE USING ONE TIME FUNDS WOULDN'T IT MAKE MORE SENSE. TO PUT IN THOSE DISTRICTS THAT NEED IT THE MOST- SURE SO I GUESS I GUESS I WOULD I WOULD. GO BACK TO- MY PREVIOUS POINT- YOU KNOW BY BY MAKING THOSE CHANGES- YOU KNOW OFF OF THE- TWENTY. TWENTY ONE KITCHEN INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING- WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE THIS YOU KNOW FUNDING. AVAILABLE ADD AS MANY ELEAZAR POSSIBLE INCLUDING YOU KNOW THE ONES THE ONES THAT WE NEED IT MOST- I THINK IN RESPONSE- YOU KNOW SORT OF. WHAT ABOUT MAKING A KIND OF HOLISTIC YOU KNOW IMPROVEMENT AS WE GO TOWARDS UNIVERSAL MEALS- I THINK THAT IS YOU KNOW ONE OF OUR INTENTIONS AND ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE HAVE ALSO ADDED THIS FUNDING FOR- SCRATCH COOKING I THINK WE SORT OF SEE THIS AS AN IMPORTANT OWNER OF UNIVERSAL MEALS RIGHT- YEAH INCREASING. THE QUALITY OF MEALS I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT STEP- IN TERMS OF JUST INCREASING THE- PARTICIPATION- I THINK ONE OF OUR HOPES AND INTENTIONS. WITH THIS AS WELL RIGHT IS INCREASING THE QUALITY MEALS INCREASING THE PARTICIPATION- YEAH WILL WILL INCREASE B. THE REVENUE THAT- YEAH ELEAZER WILLS ARE ABLE TO GENERATE FROM THIS- I THINK WE'VE RELEASE. YOU KNOW ANECDOTALLY- OF SCHOOLS THAT IT GOT KIND OF EXPANDED OR STOOD UP PROGRAMS YEAH. THE BREAKFAST PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE- YOU KNOW BEING ABLE TO- YOU KNOW USED USED ADDITIONAL REVENUE GENERATED FROM INCREASED PARTICIPATION TO INCREASE- STAFF HOURS. BUT I GUESS JUST A FOLLOW UP AND THEN I LIKE TO HEAR FROM LA- I'M I MEAN WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS USING ONE TIME FUNDING IN THE HOPES OF JUMPSTARTING ONGOING FUNDING- I MEAN AGAIN I PLUGGED THE GOAL HERE BUT BUT IF WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT ONGOING FUNDING AND A PERMANENT SHIFT. IN HOW WE PROVIDE MEALS. LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT IN THE CLASS- BUT LETS. YOU KNOW TO ME IT SEEMS INAPPROPRIATE TO BE USING ONE TIME FUNDING. WHEN WE KNOW THAT THEIR BOTTLENECKS THAT WILL REQUIRE ONGOING FUNDING TO ADDRESS I MEAN. AGAIN I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU NEED MY KIDS EXPERIENCES BUT- I'M NOT I'M JUST NOT HEARING IT IS NOT UNIQUE. AND SO WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER IN IN THE FACE OF CONSTRAINED RESOURCES TO. THE SCALE THIS TO THE SCHOOL ELEAZAR SCHOOLS THAT NEED IT THE MOST IN THE WAY THE L. A. O. HAS ITS PROPOSED- YOU KNOW AND I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS WHAT. HOW MUCH IS FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO GET US TO CENTER TOWBOATS QUESTION. WHAT DOES THAT GET US AS FAR AS KITCHEN UPGRADES AS FAR AS STAFFING INCREASES AS FAR AS- MEALS. YOU KNOW IF THE GOAL HERE IS TO CREATE SOMETHING MORE SUSTAINABLE I I'D BE INTERESTED IN KNOWING SOARED HOW MANY KITCHENS THIS THAT UPGRADE- HOW MUCH STAFF DOES THAT GET US. OUT HOW MANY SCHOOLS CAN ACTUALLY GET TO PROVIDE YOU KNOW GOOD. HEALTHY MEALS TO ALL THEIR STUDENTS. BUT MAYBE I'D LIKE TO FROM LA HERE. THANK YOU SENATOR MAN IMMEDIATELY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I THINK YOUR COMMENT SPEAKS TO THEIR NUMBER BUT THE CONCERNS THAT WE RAISED IN OUR TESTIMONY ENACT ANALYSIS AS WELL- ARE UNDERSTANDING THE SITUATION IS I DISTRICTS REALLY ARE STARTING IN VERY DIFFERENT STARTING POINTS. WHEN IT COMES TO UNIVERSAL MEALS YOU HAVE SOME DISTRICTS THAT MEET NOT HAVE A VERY ROBUST SCHOOL LUNCH AND SCHOOL BREAKFAST- PROGRAM AND THEY WILL BE EXPECTED TO SERVE OR BE ABLE TO SERVE ALL OF OUR STUDENTS ARE TESTING CAMILLE'S FROM EITHER LUNCH OR BREAKFAST. AND SO I THINK RIGHT NOW IT'S JUST-% CONCERNS OVER HOW AND THE FUNDS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING IS BEING TARGETED AND WE DON'T NECESSARILY SEE IT BEING TARGETED BASED OFF OF SOME MEASURE OF CAPACITY NEED. TO SORT OF ACCOUNT FOR THOSE I DISTRICTS THAT MIGHT NOT HAVE A ROBUST. SCHOOL SCHOOL MEAL PROGRAM IT WILL NEED TO EXPAND IT SIGNIFICANTLY TO MEET THE NEW C. REQUIREMENTS STARTING IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND THE OTHER THING WE WANT TO MENTION IS ANYTHING. BOTH YOU ARE SENATOR MAN AND SENATOR CHOI BOGUE SORT OF SPOKE TO LAST IS WE CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE A DEMAND I UNDERSTAND OF WHAT THE DEMAND IS FOR KITCHEN INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES ASSOCIATED WITH UNIVERSAL MEALS. I THINK WE HAVE A SENSE AS TO WHAT- IT DISTRICTS. A FAIR NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL TEACHING RESOURCES TO NEED ADDITIONAL NEEDS BUT WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE A SENSE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THAT FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION WILL MEET THAT NEED WILL EXCEED THAT NEED. AND SO- RECOMMENDATION WAS REALLY TO PROVIDE PROVIDE PROVIDE A REDUCED AMOUNT UNTIL MORE INFORMATION COMES AVAILABLE AND- BASED OFF- AND MYSTERIES ELS- TESTIMONY FROM CD IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE SHOULD BE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE IN MID MARCH TO SORT OF HELP GAUGE WHETHER OR NOT THE FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION PROPOSED. WHAT KIND OF S. THAT NEEDS SOME OF THAT NEED FOR AN ADDITIONAL. TEACHING INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES. I THINK I'M JUST TRYING TO. ABOUT THE REASON WE PROPOSE- THE LET PROVIDE WOULD DO AMOUNT REALLY HELP STABILIZE THE SYSTEM WHEN IT TO WILL WE RECKON THAT THIS ARE COUNTING LOT OF. FACTORS INTO SOME OF WHICH ARE REAL TO STAFFING SHE AND WE THINK GIVING THEM THE TIME TO REALLY DESTABILIZE THEIR OPERATIONS FOCUS ON UNIVERSAL MEALS AND THEN MAYBE LATER ON APPROACH AND SORT OF A DRESS AT SCRATCH COOKING AND FIND WAYS TO INCORPORATE MORE SCRATCH COOKING IT MAY BE A MORE REASONABLE SORT OF MIDLINE APPROACH- THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR IMPLEMENTATION PURPOSES. THANK YOU IS IT AS A VERY HELPFUL AND THOUGHTFUL ANSWERED I GUESS I SAYS LOOK AT UNIVERSAL LUNCHES SOUNDS GREAT BUT IF WE WANT THIS TO BE MORE THAN JUST A SLOGAN WE HAVE TO YOU KNOW REALLY CROSS ARE TEASING DAUGHTER EYES WE HAVE TO. HAVE THE DATA THAT THAT MISLEADS REFERRING TO- IN IN THE MEANTIME MAYBE IT'S PREFERABLE YOU KNOW MY KIDS DON'T NEED FOR A LUNCH- YOU KNOW IT IT'S A GREAT PART TO HAVE BEEN AND I GET HAT WE WE'RE KIND OF THE STIGMATIZING THIS BUT- TO EXTENT THAT YOU KNOW CERTAIN SCHOOLS MAY NEED THIS PROGRAM MORE THAN OTHERS AND WE'RE NOT OPERATING IN THE SPACE OF. UNLIMITED RESOURCES NOR DOES THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED ENOUGH RESOURCES TO REALLY MAKE THIS HOLISTIC ACROSS THE BOARD- YOU KNOW I I'M EAGER FOR MORE DATA BUT BUT I'M INCLINED TO SUPPORT THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE AS. WELL AS L. A. O. THANK YOU. OUR ROAD SHOW BOOK. JUST ONE LAST COMMENT- THAT I REALLY. THE NOTION OF HOW. CAPACITY VERSUS BASELINE. ESPECIALLY WHENIT COMES TO THIS- NEW TERRITORY THERE WERE THERE WERE EXPLORING- MOVING FORWARD. I'M WITH YOU SEE THAT IT WOULD BE THE MOST HELPFUL. FOR SCHOOLS THAT DO NOT ALREADY HAVE THE TO ME A PROGRAM SO I JUST WANTED TO PUT THAT ON RECORD THERE THANK YOU. THANK YOU END UP. I THANK THE PANELISTS AND I THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR- REALLY- HAVING A VERY GOOD INFORMATIVE DISCUSSION ON THAT ITEM. GONNA MOVE OR OR THANK THE PANELISTS BURKE. BROUGH TOUR ABOUT TO MAKE A RETURN APPEARANCE SO WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO ISSUE THREE MULTI LINGUAL LIBRARIES. OUR PANEL IS OUT SHOPE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE EMILY FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND ALICIA MORENO RAMIREZ FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WILL TAKE THEM IN THAT ORDER AND WILL WELCOME MISTER SHOW BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. HEY ELIGIBLE FINANCE- TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ONETIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO CREATE THE MULTILINGUAL CLASSROOM LIBRARY GRANT PROGRAMS. TO ALLOW SCHOOLS TO ESTABLISH OR EXPAND SCHOOL OR CLASS CLASSROOM LIBRARIES. OFFERING CULTURALLY RELEVANT TAX- FUNDS WILL BE ALLOCATED TO SCHOOLS MEETING MINIMUM THRESHOLDS FOR FREE AND REDUCED. PRICE MEALS PERCENTAGE CAN IN WHISTLER PERCENTAGE- AND CAN BE USED TO BUY BOOKS TO ESTABLISH A SCHOOL OR CLASSROOM LIBRARIES FOR STUDENTS IN PRESCHOOL THROUGH. THIRD. GRADE- THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE L. L. IF YOU MISTER CHAIR AND LEAVE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AGAIN. OUR ANALYSIS ON THE GOVERNOR'S MULTILINGUAL BOOKS PROPOSAL WILL ONLY BE RELEASED LATER TODAY BUT I DID WANT TO SHARE OUR ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATION ON THIS PROPOSAL FROM THAT ANALYSIS. OVERALL WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THIS PROPOSAL WE FIND THAT SCHOOLS HAVE A VARIETY OF EXISTING FUNDING SOURCES THERE WHICH THEY CAN FIND ADDITIONAL MULTI LINGUAL AND CULTURALLY RELEVANT BOOKS PRIMARILY THROUGH LCS FAST I MEAN FUNDING FORMULA FOR SCHOOLS. IN ADDITION TO SIGNIFICANT RECENT ONE FUN ONE TIME FUNDING FROM THE COMIC RELIEF FUNDS STATE LOTTERY REVENUE PRIVATE DONATIONS JUST TO NAME A FEW. WE THINK THE ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH OF PROVIDING RESTRICTED FUNDING FOR CERTAIN EARLY LITERACY ACTIVITIES IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH ORIGINAL LEGISLATIVE INTENT THAT AT LEAST LOCALLY DETERMINED AND FIND PRIORITIES UNDER LCS FAST FURTHERMORE TO DATE HAS BEEN VERY LITTLE RESEARCH ON THE IMPACT OF HAVING MORE MULTILINGUAL BOOKS IN SCHOOL LIBRARIES ON CHILDREN'S LITERACY. CHILDREN COULD ALSO ACCESS SUCH BOOKS FROM THEIR LOCAL PUBLIC LIBRARY ADDITIONALLY IT PROVIDING MORE BOOKS IN SCHOOL AND CLASSROOM LIBRARIES WOULD NOT DIRECTLY IMPROVE OR RESULT IN EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTION WHICH WOULD BENEFIT MOST STUDENTS WE THINK OTHER STATE INITIATIVES COULD BETTER SUPPORT ENGLISH LEARNERS AS INCREASING THE NUMBER OF. BILINGUAL TEACHERS ARE PROVIDED FOR TRAINING FOR TEACHERS TO SUPPORT ENGLISH LEARNERS BECAUSE OF THESE REASONS WE RECOMMEND TO THE LEGISLATURE REJECTS THE PROPOSED FUNDING FOR MULTI LINGUAL BOOKS THEREBY FREEING UP TWO HUNDRED MILLION FOR OTHER LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES THAT CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS AND HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU AND. THEN WILL MOVE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR- OF THE TEAM. HEY LISA MARIE MARY'S. OF THE MOST LEGAL SO DIVISION AT CD ON THE OF THE DIFFERENT OF PUBLIC AND- WE'RE PLEASED TO SEE THIS PROPOSAL IT RELATES TO SUPERINTENDENT THURMAN'S. STATEWIDE LITERACY AND BY LITERACY CAMPAIGN. REACHING LITERACY BY THIRD GRADE HAS LONG BEEN A GOAL OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS A KEY BENCHMARK AND MEASURING AND PREDICTING STUDENT SUCCESS. WE MUST TAKE BOLD ACTION TO HELP STUDENTS MEET THIS IMPORTANT MILESTONE AND PUT THEM ON A PATH FOR LIFELONG LEARNING AS OPPOSED TO A PATH THAT INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THEY WILL DROP OUT OF SCHOOL. OR END UP IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. OVER PRISONS CANNOT READ ABOUT THE FOURTH GRADE LEVEL THAT NEEDS TO STOP. AND THERE'S NO BETTER TIME THAN THE PRESENT. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL BREAKS NICELY WAS SUPERINTENDENT THURMAN'S MILLION BOOKS CAMPAIGN TO PROVIDE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES WITH ACCESS TO TAX. ONE STUDY FOUND THAT YOUNG CHILDREN WHO READ FIVE TIMES DAILY WELL HERE NEARLY ONE POINT FIVE MILLION WORDS BY THE TIME THEY TURN FIVE YEARS OF AGE DURING THEIR LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY AND ESTABLISHING A STRONG FOUNDATION FOR ACADEMIC SUCCESS. READING TO THIS EXTENT REQUIRES ACCESS TO MANY BOOKS AND THOUGHTFUL CURATION OF LIBRARIES TO BE MOST APPROPRIATE TO THE DEVELOPMENTAL CULTURAL LINGUISTIC AND READABILITY NEEDS. THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION LIBRARY BILL OF RIGHTS ASSERTS THAT BOOKS AND OTHER LIBRARY RESOURCES SHOULD BE PROVIDED FOR THE INTEREST FORMATION AND ENLIGHTENMENT OF ALL PEOPLE- I THANK THE LIBRARY SERVICE. MOREOVER IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT AS OUR SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES BECOME INCREASINGLY DIVERSE BOTH CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT NEED TO REFRESH SCHOOL LIBRARIES MANY OF WHICH HAVE AVERAGE COPYRIGHT DATES IF TWENTY YEARS OLDER OLDER AND ARE NOT REFLECTIVE OF TODAY'S DEMOGRAPHIC. THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT WILL HELP ENSURE MULTI LINGUAL AND CULTURALLY RELEVANT TAX CAN BE MADE ACCESSIBLE TO CHILDREN IN PRESCHOOL THROUGH THIRD GRADE. SCHOOL LIBRARIES AND CLASSROOM LIBRARIES TO PROMOTE LITERACY IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. MULTIPACK MULTI LEVEL TAX WILL PROMOTE MORE EQUITABLE REPRESENTATION OF DIVERSE CULTURAL. EXPERIENCES AS PART OF LITERACY BY LITERACY OR EVEN MULTI LITERACY DEVELOPMENT IN YOUNG CHILDREN WHEN THE BRAIN IS MOST RECEPTIVE TO EXPANDING LANGUAGE LEARNING. WHAT ILLEGAL RESOURCES ARE ESSENTIAL TO SUPPORT LITERACY AND BY LITERACY DEVELOPMENT IN CALIFORNIA STUDENTS AND THESE RESOURCES ARE OFTEN THE LEAST ACCESSIBLE CALIFORNIA CLASSROOMS DUE TO FACTORS SUCH AS COST. ACCESS TO THESE TAX WILL PUT WITHIN REACH CRITICAL LEARNING RESOURCES FOR EMERGENT MULTILINGUAL STUDENTS ENJOY A LANGUAGE IMMERSION CLASSROOMS WHERE THEY'RE LEARNING ACADEMICS AND DEVELOPING A LANGUAGE IN BOTH ENGLISH AND A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH. THEY ARE CURRENTLY REPORTED ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED NINETY MULT LINGUAL CLASSROOMS IN CALIFORNIA HAS A TWENTY NINETEEN. AND WITH GROWING INTEREST IN EXPANDING DUAL LANGUAGE PROGRAMS LEARNERS NEED EQUITABLE ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY LITERATURE AND LEVEL TAX IN VARIOUS LANGUAGES IN ADDITION TO ENGLISH IN ORDER TO DEVELOP DEEP LITERACY PROFICIENCY THAT WILL BENEFIT ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT. DISPARITIES ALSO NOTED IN THE NUMBER OF RESOURCES AVAILABLE IN ENGLISH COMPARED TO THE RESOURCES ACCESSIBLE IN LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH IN SCHOOL AND CLASSROOM LIBRARIES AS WELL AS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES. FURTHER MULTI LINGUAL SCHOOL AND CLASSROOM LIBRARIES CONSERVA SOCIO OKAY SOCIO EMOTIONAL AND ACADEMIC SUPPORTS FOR THE OVER ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND NEWLY ARRIVED IMMIGRANT AND REFUGEE STUDENTS. AS A TRANSITION IT CALIFORNIA'S EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. MULTI LINGUAL TEXT PROVIDING STUDENTS STEPPING STONE INTO ENGLISH LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY AS WELL AS A FIRM STUDENTS CULTURES AND HOME LANGUAGE. SUPPORTING MULTILINGUAL LEARNERS TO DEVELOP STRONGER SKILLS IN THEIR HOME LANGUAGE IS ALSO AN EQUITY ISSUE THAT LEADS TO STRONGER ENGLISH LANGUAGE ACQUISITION. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT LITERACY AND HOME LANGUAGE AN ONGOING PRACTICE READING AND WRITING IN THAT LANGUAGE CAN MOST READILY FACILITATE THE ACQUISITION OF LITERACY AND AN ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE SUCH AS ENGLISH. AS MANY LITERACY SKILLS CAN BE TRANSFERRED ACROSS LANGUAGES. MULTILINGUAL AND CULTURALLY RELEVANT TAX BENEFIT LEARNERS IN OTHER WAYS AS WELL FOR EXAMPLE SEEING A REPRESENTATION OFONESELF IS IN TAXES CULTURALLY AFFIRMING THEREBY HELPING SUPPORT SOCIAL EMOTIONAL WELL BEING WHICH IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT AT A TIME. WHEN MULTIPLE WENT ON MENTAL WELLNESS IS OF CRITICAL CONSIDERATION. WE'RE ENCOURAGED BY THE INVESTMENT IN A MULTI LINGUAL AND CULTURALLY RELEVANT SCHOOL AND CLASSROOM LIBRARIES PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME AND OUR DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT SARAH NOBLE MORGAN THIS YEAR IN CASE YOU HAVE QUESTIONS RELATED TO EARLY IDENTIFICATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT COMPLETES THE PANEL WILL MOVE TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS FROM. COMMITTEE MEMBERS I JUST HAD A COMMENT AND THAT IS TO SAY I FOCUS ON THE- YEAH GO AHEAD OF THAT AND IT'S JUST TO SAY THAT I FULLY SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL AND THAT I PLUG THE GOVERNOR AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOR- PUSHING THESE PARTIES FORWARD IT IS IMPORTANT FOR. AS WAS STATED FOR KIDS. TO SEE REPRESENTATION THEMSELVES THAT TO ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT WE DO HAVE SUCH A DIVERSE POPULATION IN THIS. STATE AND A TIME WHEN THERE IS A LOT OF RACIAL ANIMOSITY ARISING- I THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE- YOU KNOW THROUGH THROUGH NOT JUST OUR OUR WORDS BUT ALSO IS THERE ARE ACTIONS MAKE PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THAT WE DO WELCOME THIS DIVERSITY. THANK YOU SANDRA TROUBLED. YES SO- FIRST OF ALL AS A FORMER ENGLISH LANGUAGE. LEARNER TEACHER I COMMEND THE MERITS AND I DO NOT QUESTION AT ALL THE MERIT- WHATSOEVER I THINK IT'S- WE ALL UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF LITERACY AND- SPECIALLY- AS YOU'RE LEARNING A SECOND LANGUAGE. RIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE THE GROWTH- IN YOUR PRIMARY LANGUAGE AS FAR AS VOCABULARY GOES AND CONCEPT ART AND SO FORTH SO. ABSOLUTELY IN IN IN SUPPORT OF AB. THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING- BOOKS THAT REFLECT OUR OUR LANGUAGE OUR PARTY LEADERS AS WE LEARN ENGLISH- I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS WITH REGARDS TO- THE CURRENT FUNDING THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW THAT'S BEEN ALLOCATED. ARE INCREASE FUNDING THAT OUR. SCHOOLS ARE RECEIVING- AND- V. MY THAT GO- THROUGH THE L. C. F. AS IN- CATEGORICAL MONIES THAT GO FOR. CHILDREN AND SO FORTH HOW DOES THAT SHOULDN'T THE MONIES THAT OUR CHILDREN ARE DEPLETED CHILDREN ALREADY RECEIVE THE COVERING THE SORT OF MATERIALS FOR OUR OUR ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS SINCE THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE. THE CIVICALLY- ADDRESSED IN OUR UNDUPLICATED STUDENTS. CHAU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I THINK THAT I WOULD I WOULD I WOULD JUST FOR CHIU CD E. A. R. YOU KNOW MORE SPECIFICS- AS TO- YOU KNOW HOW HOW. THESE THESE THESE NEEDS ARE BEING ARE BEING COVERED BY YOU KNOW OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDING- I WOULD PROBABLY JUST NO GENERALLY- YES PROPOSALS MEANT TO TARGET SOME OF THE HIGHEST NEEDS SCHOOLS HIGHER LEVELS OF ENGLISH LEARNERS- AND YOU HAVE A- OF FUNDS FOR THESE SPECIFIC CHILDREN ALREADY. IN OUR FUNDING FORMULA I MEAN THAT'S WHY WE HAVE. FUNDING SPECIFICALLY FOR UNDUPLICATED STUDENTS WHICH ARE ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS SHOULDN'T THAT FUNDING BE UTILIZED FOR- BUYING MATERIALS AND RESOURCES FOR OUR CHILDREN ARE LEARNING ENGLISH I MEAN WE ALREADY THAT SPECIFICALLY. AT THE TOP OF FUNDING THAT WE'VE BEEN PROVIDING SO FORTH AND I'M JUST I'M SAYING THIS BECAUSE WE'RE WE'VE WE'VE ALLOCATED A LOT OF FUNDING THIS PAST YEAR AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO DO THAT AND SO I'M JUST KIND OF CURIOUS AS TO. WHY AN ADDITIONAL FUNDING IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT- BUT WE SHOULD ALREADY BE DOING WITHIN THE CAPACITY OF OUR THE FUNDING THEY WERE ALREADY IN PLACE SO I'M JUST KIND OF CURIOUS AS TO. WHY DO WE HAVE AN ADDITIONALLY SHOULD WE ALREADY BE DOING THIS. WITH THE FUNDS ARE BEING ALLOCATED. ALICIA MORE IN OUR MARRIAGE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION I WILL SAY THAT THAT IS ABSOLUTELY ASPIRATIONAL I'M A ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT I BELIEVE SCHOOLS FACE WHEN IT COMES TO DISTRIBUTING FUNDING. IS IN PART WHEN THEY ARE CONSIDERING THINKING ABOUT- FUNDING FOR ENGLISH LEARNER SPECIFICALLY OFTENTIMES THEY DIFFER TO ENGLISH LANGUAGE MATERIALS- WHERE AS THIS PARTICULAR EFFORT IS CONCENTRATED ON IT DO WHAT LANGUAGE ARE MULTI LINGUAL MATERIALS THAT ARE INTENDED TO BENEFIT ALL LEARNERS IN CALIFORNIA CLASSROOMS. PARTICULARLY IN DUAL LANGUAGE PROGRAMS. OKAY THAT'S MUCH MORE HELPFUL THAT CLARIFICATION RIGHT THERE WOULD BE MORE HELPFUL BECAUSE- AND IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE I DO HAVE TO SAY THAT. I WOULD BE VERY VERY HIGH DISAPPOINTED TO HEAR THAT ARE FUNDING FOR OUR UNDUPLICATED CHILDREN SPECIFICALLY ARE ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS WOULD NOT BE RECEIVING MATERIALS BOTH TO LEARN ENGLISH AND TO ALSO SUPPORT THEIR PRIMARY LANGUAGE IN THE CLASSROOM AS A FORMER TEACHER FOR THESE CHILDREN I HAD YOU KNOW I HAD BOTH ENGLISH AND I MADE SURE THAT I. I YOU KNOW FACILITATED BOOKS FOR BOTH IN BOTH LANGUAGES TO SUPPORT THEIR LEARNING PROCESS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I'VE BEEN ALWAYS AN ADVOCATE OF MAKING SURE THAT- I HAVE BEEN OPENLY AN ADVOCATE OF- TEACHING CHILDREN IN THEIR PRIMARY LANGUAGE- THE COR CONTENT COR- DISCOUNTED WHILE THEY LEARN ENGLISH SO THAT THEY DON'T FALL BEHIND ACADEMICALLY. SO JUST WENT OUT AND THEN LAST QUESTION HERE- IF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS A COMMENT ON THE L. A. O.'S RECOMMENDATION TO REJECT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL AFTER THE ONE TIME FOR A PROGRAM- THAT WE HAVE A LIMITED IMPACT THEIR DISAGREED. YES THEY DO. AND I JUST WANT TO I JUST WANNA HEAR THEIR THOUGHTS ON. SURE SO I THINK AS I HAVE BEEN NOTED EARLIER THIS PROPOSAL REYES MEANT TO TARGET HIS NEW SCHOOLS WITH HIGH LEVELS OF ENGLISH LEARNERS- I THINK I MIGHT CALL YOU IT SEES OF THE SIX POINTED AT US. A LOT OF- GOOD READ. AS TO. THE ETHICS OF THIS FUND- AND THE WAY THAT I CAN IMPACT AREAS ACADEMIC OUTCOMES I THINK WE'VE ALSO SEEN- SOME RESEARCH SHOWING THAT YOU KNOW STUDENTS LIVING IN POVERTY- WORKING FOR STUDENTS OF COLOR SHOW THE GREATEST GAINS AND LITERACY- FOREMAN'S ON STANDARDIZED TESTS. WHEN THEY HAVE ACCESS. TO STRONG LIBRARY PROGRAMS- I THINK ALSO GIVEN THAT- YES UNDERSTANDING THAT IT'S BEEN OVER. TWO YEARS SINCE THE STATE HAS REALLY FOCUSED RESOURCES ON UPDATING SCHOOL LIBRARIES- WE DO BELIEVE IT IS IMPORTANT TO. PROVIDE THESE RESOURCES TO ENSURE- IT YET HIS MATERIALS ARE CONTENT IN AGE APPROPRIATE AS WELL AS- CULTURALLY RELEVANT. DEVELOPMENT STUDENTS HOME LANGUAGE. WELL THANK YOU I JUST WANNA JUST JUST AND MY COMMENTS WITH THE FACT THAT IF OUR SCHOOLS. ARE NOT UTILIZING FUNDING TO SUPPORT LITERACY PROGRAMS THAT COME SPECIFICALLY BASED ON OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WE NEED TO WHAT TYPEOF CLUSTER AS WE NEED TO CREATE TO SUPPORT OUR ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND THAT MEANS HAVING- BOOKS IN THEIR PRIMARY LANGUAGE WITH THE EXTRA FUNDING THAT WE ALREADY PROVIDE. THERE ARE HAVE ALREADY BEEN IN PLACE SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN THIRTEENTH I BELIEVE WHEN THERE WAS A- THAT THE FORMULA- WAS REVISED I'M SORRY WAS REVISED REVISED- THEN WE'RE IN WE ARE IN TROUBLE AND I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT WE- ARE LOCAL- EDUCATIONAL. AGENCIES DEFINITELY LOOK INTO MAKING SURE THAT WE DO BECAUSE I. MY SPEAR MY SPACE- IN IN WOULD HAVE IN THE SCHOOL TO PROVIDE A WORKING WITH. THEY'VE BEEN VERY VERY SUCCESSFUL IN MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THOSE MULTI LINGUAL OF BOOKS IN THE CLASSROOM AS OUR CHILDREN BUT I'VE JUST WANTED. WANTED TO KNOW THAT FOR THE RECORD THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE A AND LET ME PRICA APPRECIATE TO THIS DISCUSSION MAKE A CLOSING COMMENT AND I WAS MAKING A- A SNARKY OFF THE MY COMMENT. WITH REGARD TO THE QUESTION. OF FINANCES TO WHETHER THEY AGREED WITH THE L. A. WE- ADVISING US TO REJECT THE- RECOMMENDATION THAT I WAS SURE THEY DISAGREED ARM. BUT I THINK THA. THIS DISCUSSION HAS BEEN REALLY ILLUSTRATIVE. BECAUSE I THINK CENTER MAN ARTICULATELY. OUTLINED THE NEED FOR THIS AND THEN TO WHAT IT WORKS AGAINST AND I THINK SENATOR OCHO BOGUE. AGREED BUT JUST SAID IS THIS THE APPROPRIATE FUNDING SOURCE FROM OTHER OTHER PLACES TO DO IT. AND WAIT FOR A WAY. HAD THE BENEFIT OF THE ALEJO'S RECOMMENDATION WHICH IS GOING TO BE RELEASED LATER TODAY BUT HAVE THE DISCUSSION WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO SEE THE FULL REPORT AND TAKING A LOOK AT IT. AND SO I THINK THE NET RESULT OF ALL THIS IS. IS THAT OF THE COMMITTEE SEEMS TO HAVE A STRONG CONSENSUS THAT WE WANT THIS BUT WE THINK OVER THE NEXT MONTHS THE DISCUSSION SHOULD BE. ABOUT WHAT'S THE APPROPRIATE SOURCE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THIS AND I THINK THAT'S THE DISCUSSION THAT CAME OUT WITH TODAY'S. SUBCOMMITTEE SO THAT THANK YOU FOR ON PANEL FOR ISSUE THREE. AND WE WILL MOVE TO ISSUE. THE FREMONT HOUSING MODERNIZATION PROJECT. OR OUR PANELISTS RANDALL CAPS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AMY LEE FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE.

I'M AVAILABLE AS WELL AS JENNIFER MALCOLM DEPARTMENTAL CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE SUPERVISOR FOR THE STATE SPECIAL SCHOOLS AND SERVICES DIVISION THE ANSWER ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS. YOU HAVE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU VERY WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION AND MAYBE LET ME MAKE A BRIEF STATEMENT. AND THEN ASK A QUESTION THAT IS PROBABLY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. BUT ARM WE HAVE I THINK THREE OUR SCHOOLS IN THE STATE THE DOOR SPECIAL SCHOOLS DIAGNOSTIC CENTERS OF. AND THEY ARE LISTED IN OUR AGENDA PACKET AND WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THEY DON'T USUALLY COME IN FRONT OF THIS- COMMITTEE THEY'RE USUALLY VERY DEEPLY IN THE BUDGET AND- JUST RENEWED EVERY YEAR. AND EXCEPT FOR OUR ITEMS LIKE THIS WE WOULDN'T TALK ABOUT THEM AND I ASKED THAT IT BE ELEVATED FOR DISCUSSION SO THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE IN OUR CHEN. OF THE SCHOOLS IN A RELATIVE THING AND WE HAD A VERY HEARTWARMING STORY ABOUT THE SUCCESSFUL SPORTS TEAM OUT OF RIVERSIDE FROM ONE OF THE SCHOOLS. ARE THAT REALLY SHOWS THAT THEY'RE JUST A VITAL PART OF OUR- OF OUR LIFE AND OUR EDUCATIONAL CULTURE. AND SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE OUR EYES ON IT JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE TERROR ADEQUATELY FUNDED AND ADEQUATELY RESOURCE AND THAT WE HAVE SOME MEASURE OF OVERSIGHT OVER THE SUCCESS OF THESE INSTITUTIONS. AND SO THAT IS THE REASON IT'S HERE EVEN THOUGH IT MIGHT SEEM LIKE IT'S AN OBSCURE. ARE- ITEM IN IT A. N. G. THIS IS SOMETIMES THE ITEMS SUCH AS THE ONE IN FRONT OF US. ON THE MODERNIZATION PROJECT ON CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS AND YOU CAN'T TELL IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE REACHED A WORK. OR IF THEY GET THERE BUT I THINK THIS IS OUR STATEMENT OF SAYING THAT THEY'RE VERY IMPORTANT AND WE HOPE THAT THEY ARE REACHED AND WE- WE HOPE THAT THAT THAT THERE IS DISCUSSION IT IS A PRIORITY FOR THE INSTITUTIONS OF STATE GOVERNMENT THAT WOULD DEAL WITH THIS. MY ONE QUESTION IS PROBABLY FOR THE REALLY WHAT RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE TO THE STATE SPECIAL SCHOOLS FOR EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES IS THERE ARE COMMON FUND. THEY CAN TAP INTO FOR SPORTS OR OTHER EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES BECAUSE- IT SEEMS LIKE IMPROVEMENTS FOR SOME OF THE SPORTS FACILITIES. THAT WERE JUST HIGHLIGHTED AND SEEM TO BE SUCH. A OF ALL LWER- JUST OF OUR LAST IMPROVED SPORTS FACILITIES AND WE HAVE FOR OTHER SIMILAR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS SO QUESTIONS WHAT RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE TO THE STATE. A SPECIAL SCHOOLS FOR EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES AND I THINK THAT SHOULD GO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. SO THERE IS NO LINE ITEM AT THIS POINT BUT I DO WANT TO STATE THAT LIKE MILLIONS OF OTHER CALIFORNIANS THE GOVERNOR WAS INSPIRED BY THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF RIVERSIDE'S FOOTBALL TEAM SUCCESS LAST SEASON- THE PROJECT TO UPGRADE. THE CST OUR SPORTS FIELD AND BLEACHERS WILL BE UNDER CONSIDERATION THIS SPRING ONCE THE PROJECT SCOPE INCLUDING SWING SPACE FOR THE TEAMS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES AS WELL AS MANY FAMILIES. SO THAT IS I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SHOULD HAVE USED THE PHRASE WING SPACE TO THE LEGISLATURE THAT MIGHT. THAT MIGHT NOT MAKERS OF JUMPED IMMEDIATELY IN SUPPORT- BUT DO YOU THINK THAT THAT INFORMATION WILL BE READY IN TIME TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THIS CONSIDERED AS PART OF. A MAY. BUDGET WE'RE HOPEFUL APPRECIATE THE HOPE I APPRECIATE THE FAITH WAS JUST TRYING TO MAKE THAT INFORMATION HAPPENED SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY HAVE THE DISCUSSION IN THE ARMY. AND I THANK YOU FOR THE BACKGROUND ON THIS LET ME ASK MY COLLEAGUES IF THERE ANY QUESTIONS BEFORE WE MOVE ON. SEEING NONE. A BAR I JUST APPRECIATE THAT DISCUSSION. AND WE WILL MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER FIVE THE SCHOOL FACILITY PROGRAM. AND WE HAVE JENNIFER KACU AND I APOLOGIZE IF I MISPRONOUNCE YOUR NAME FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE.

WE NOTICED THAT THE FUNDING SCHOOL FACILITIES PROJECTS USE USING WE KNOW THAT USING- SCHOOL. FUNDING SCHOOL FACILITIES PROJECTS USING GENERAL FUND WILL LIKELY BE LESS COSTLY THAN USING GENERAL OBLIGATION FUNDS DUE TO STATE SAVINGS ON INTEREST COSTS LASTLY AS MENTIONED IN YOUR AGENDA EARLIER IN THE HEARING IN THE STATE IS ABOVE ITS STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE.

THE SCHOOL FACILITY PER IS A PER WITH THIS PARTY WITH LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES IN ORDER TO FIND THEIR SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS. THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL OVER THE YEARS. AND AS A RESULT SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY- AND HOW THEY USE OUR FUNDS AND IT'S BASED ON THEIR LOCAL PRIORITIES. SINCE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. FORTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS HAVE BEEN- AUTHORIZED BY VOTERS FOR THE SCHOOL FACILITIES PROGRAM. AND TO THAT EXTENT WE HAVEAWARDED OVER THIRTY NINE BILLION DOLLARS TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS STATEWIDE.

FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY THREE THREE MILLION DOLLARS. AND AS THEY SHARED EARLIER- MY COLLEAGUES FROM AND LEO- WE HAVE APPLICATIONS RECEIVED BONTA AND BEYOND BONTA THIRTY LIST.

AGAIN THEY HAVE TO HAVE AN APPROVAL WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND THE DIVISION STATE ACHITECTURE PROVOKING FOR COMING IN FOR FINDING. OUR PROGRAM ESTABLISHES WHETHER NOT THEY MEET THE ELIGIBILITY COMPONENTS. AND IF THEY DO THE PROGRAM THE PROJECT CAN ADVANCE AND ALSO SUBMIT A PLANNING APPLICATION. AND OTHER STEP IS THE C. I. CATION BOARD APPROVING THE PROJECT ONCE STAFF HAVE REVIEW. REVIEW IS COMPLETED. AND TO THAT EXTENT- THE CURRENT PROCESS IS THE ONES OF PROJECTS HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY ISRAELI CATION BOARD AND HOW THE SPAWNING DORIA SITE TO ASSIGN TO THAT. THEN WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR CASH AS A RESULT OF THE BOND% SALE BEFORE WE CAN RELEASE CASH TUNING TO DISTRICTS FOR THEIR- PROJECTS. AND TO THAT EXTENT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER. ANY QUESTIONS AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPTION PERCENT. THANK YOU VERY. OF A COMMENT NINE ONE QUESTION. IN THE COMMON IS THAT BASED ON. OF COURSE EVERYWHERE I GO AND WITH EVERY EDUCATION GROUP THERE'S A STATEMENT THAT. THAT WE ARE RUNNING OUT OF MONEY AND THERE'S NOT ADEQUATE MONEY FOR FACILITIES THERE'S A REAL NEED ACROSS THE STATE AND- IN THE STAFF REPORT IT CORROBORATED BY THE TESTIMONY HERE IT WAS REALLY. ONE POINT FOUR BILLION AS THE LAST OF WHAT EXISTS IN AND BOND MONEY THAT IS ALREADY. APPROPRIATED AND THEN TWO POINT TWO BILLION THAT THE GOVERNOR'S RECOMMENDING OVER THE NEXT TWO BUDGET YEARS- AS THE NEXT STEP FOR THAT TO TRY TO TAKE THE FACILITY SAYS THE COMMON USE THAT. OUR OUR MONEY FROM THIS YEAR'S BUDGET TO DO IT. THEN LET ME ASK FINANCE FROM. THE IMPLICATION IS AND I THINK SOMEBODY EVEN USED THE WORD. THAT THIS IS A BRIDGE A BRIDGE TO SOME FUTURE FUNDING SOURCE DECEIT MINISTRATION HAVE A POSITION ON THE NEXT FUNDING SOURCE. WHAT IT MIGHT BE IF WE APPROVE THE SAID AND HOW WE WOULD GO FORWARD AFTER THE.
