CREATE CAMPUS MEDICINES WHICH

00:11:03.362 --> 00:11:04.563
WOULD SLOW DOWN THE GROWTH OF

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:05.998
THE CANCER.

00:11:06.065 --> 00:11:08.634
AND GIVE HIM MORE TIME.

00:22:55.874 --> 00:22:57.309
LIFE AND THIS IS REALLY A

00:22:57.375 --> 00:22:59.711
QUALITY OF LIFE ISSUE -- WE KNOW

00:22:59.778 --> 00:23:02.147
THAT PHËN N<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;WHICH IS -- A&lt;/c&gt;</u>

00:23:02.214 --> 00:23:04.883
VERY POTENT OPIATE -- MY HUNDRED

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:06.685
TIMES STRONGER THAN MORPHINE AND

00:23:06.752 --> 00:23:09.755
MISTER BARTEL IN IS -- LATE

00:23:09.821 --> 00:23:11.490
SOMBER CONCERNED THAT HE BE

00:23:11.556 --> 00:23:13.325
SLEEPING ALL THE WAY THROUGH --

00:23:13.391 --> 00:23:16.528
HIS DEMISE IN THE HEALTH THAT.

00:23:16.595 --> 00:23:17.662
HE WANTED TO BE AWAKENED HIS

00:23:17.729 --> 00:23:19.731
FINAL HOURS AND WAS ABLE TO

00:23:19.798 --> 00:23:22.000
BENEFIT FROM FROM CANNABIS TO

00:23:22.067 --> 00:23:23.635
ALLEVIATE HIS PAIN AND TO ALLOW

00:23:23.702 --> 00:23:26.605
HIM TO HAVE -- CONSCIOUS --

00:23:26.671 --> 00:23:28.406
RELATIONS WITH IS IS.

00:23:28.473 --> 00:23:29.908
WITH HIS FAMILY IN IN AND THOSE

00:23:29.975 --> 00:23:31.610
FINAL HOURS.

00:23:31.676 --> 00:23:34.012
AND I THINK THAT.

00:23:34.079 --> 00:23:36.815
IT'S AN APPROPRIATE USE OF OF

00:23:36.882 --> 00:23:38.817
CANNABIS -- IT'S SOMETHING THAT

00:23:38.884 --> 00:23:40.152
WE HAVEN'T STUDY TOO MUCH IN

00:23:40.218 --> 00:23:41.486
THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE IT'S BEEN

00:23:41.553 --> 00:23:43.555
YOU KNOW -- ILLEGAL FOR SO MANY

00:23:43.622 --> 00:23:45.490
YEARS AND WOULD READ BY THINK

00:23:45.557 --> 00:23:47.192
SENATOR HUESO MENTION THIRTY

00:23:47.259 --> 00:23:48.894
THREE STATES NOW I EMBRACE THE

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.328
MEDICINAL MARIJUANA.

00:23:50.395 --> 00:24:01.573
AND AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF STUDY

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:02.340
THAT WOULD BEEN DONE A LOT IN

00:24:02.407 --> 00:24:02.941
ISRAEL THAT SHOW THAT THERE IS

00:24:03.008 --> 00:24:03.875
MEDICAL EFFICACY FOR IT.

00:24:03.942 --> 00:24:04.609
SO WE'RE TALKING HERE ABOUT

00:24:04.676 --> 00:24:06.011
TERMINALLY ILL PATIENTS THAT.

00:24:06.077 --> 00:24:07.546
NEED TO BE GIVEN A CHOICE -- IF

00:24:07.612 --> 00:24:08.580
CANNABIS HELP SOME AND

00:24:08.647 --> 00:24:10.048
ALLEVIATES ARE SUFFERING -- THEN

00:24:10.115 --> 00:24:12.117
WE SHOULD GIVE IT -- I DO

00:24:12.184 --> 00:24:14.586
UNDERSTAND -- THAT YOU KNOW

00:24:14.653 --> 00:24:15.821
PHYSICIANS TO HAVE A THE A

00:24:15.887 --> 00:24:17.422
LICENSE.

00:24:17.489 --> 00:24:19.090
THEY NEED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT

00:24:19.157 --> 00:24:21.493
AND I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT --

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:23.695
HOSPITAL'S SURGERY CENTERS THAT

00:24:23.762 --> 00:24:26.565
TAKE MEDICAID ALL MEDICARE --

00:24:26.631 --> 00:24:28.700
THAT HAVE SOME FEDERAL COMPONENT.

00:24:28.767 --> 00:24:30.268
I THINK THE CHURCH CONCERNS ARE

00:24:30.335 --> 00:24:31.903
ARE JUST I THINK THAT.

00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:33.572
THE SENATOR HAS MADE IT VERY

00:24:33.638 --> 00:24:36.374
CLEAR THROUGH -- SOME AMENDMENTS

00:24:36.441 --> 00:24:36.942
SAID IF THERE IS GOING TO BE

00:24:37.008 --> 00:24:39.778
SOME -- RATTLING BY THE FEDERAL

00:24:39.845 --> 00:24:41.413
GOVERNMENT THAT THERE IS GOING

00:24:41.479 --> 00:24:44.749
TO BE SOME AVENUES -- TO TO

00:24:44.816 --> 00:24:46.117
BACKTRACK IF IT IS IF CERTAIN

00:24:46.184 --> 00:24:48.954
NECESSARY BUT I DON'T FORESEE.

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:50.388
THAT HAPPENING I THINK THAT THE

00:24:50.455 --> 00:24:53.225
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ALBEIT --

00:24:53.291 --> 00:24:56.528
MAYBE THE THE PRESIDENT IS NOT

00:24:56.595 --> 00:24:57.429
THE MOST POPULAR PERSON IN THIS

00:24:57.495 --> 00:24:59.197
BUILDING THESE DAYS BUT I WILL

00:24:59.264 --> 00:25:00.265
SAY THIS THAT I THINK THE

00:25:00.332 --> 00:25:01.766
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS A WHOLE IS

00:25:01.833 --> 00:25:03.602
A VERY COMPASSIONATE -- GROUP

00:25:03.668 --> 00:25:06.972
ESPECIALLY AT THE AT THE FDA --

00:25:07.038 --> 00:25:09.574
I THINK PHYSICIANS -- ONE OF

00:25:09.641 --> 00:25:13.111
ALLEVIATE SUFFERING AS A ONE OF

00:25:13.178 --> 00:25:14.546
THE PHYSICIANS HAD HAD MENTIONED.

00:25:14.613 --> 00:25:17.148
AND YOU KNOW IF IF IF CANNABIS

00:25:17.215 --> 00:25:19.284
IS IS IS THE BETTER CATION THAT --

00:25:19.351 --> 00:25:21.853
ALLOWS.

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:23.755
ONE TO BETTER -- COPE WITH THEIR

00:25:23.822 --> 00:25:25.257
THEIR PAIN AND THEIR SUFFERING

00:25:25.323 --> 00:25:26.825
IN THEIR FINAL HOURS AND WE

00:25:26.892 --> 00:25:29.294
SHOULD BE STANDING BEHIND THEM

00:25:29.361 --> 00:25:31.630
AND LEVY THAT SUFFERING SO --

00:25:31.696 --> 00:25:33.598
GOT THE APPROPRIATE TIME I WOULD

00:25:33.665 --> 00:25:36.134

00:27:02.754 --> 00:27:03.788
VERSA.

00:27:03.855 --> 00:27:06.324

00:27:16.034 --> 00:27:17.602
LIKE THE SKILLED NURSING

00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:19.104
FACILITIES THAT DO YOU HAVE.

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:20.672

WITH CALIFORNIA ON YOUR BILL

00:27:27.212 --> 00:27:28.480
THERE'S SOME TYPE OF REMEDY THAT

00:27:28.546 --> 00:27:29.881
WOULD BE ABLE TO BE.

00:27:29.948 --> 00:27:31.116

WANT TO SUPPORT THE BILL.

00:27:33.918 --> 00:27:35.820
BUT I CAN'T DO IT NOT KNOWING

00:27:35.887 --> 00:27:37.789
THAT AND IT PUTS THEM IN

00:27:37.856 --> 00:27:39.290
JEOPARDY OF LOSING THEIR ENTIRE

00:27:39.357 --> 00:27:41.059

TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH AND THAT'S

00:28:09.054 --> 00:28:11.990
THAT AND OF COURSE SO WHY WOULD

YEAR'S AGAIN THAT SPECIFICALLY

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:49.928
LISTS CALIFORNIA.

AS ONE OF THE STATES IN WHICH

00:28:52.597 --> 00:28:54.466
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHALL NOT

00:28:54.532 --> 00:28:55.800
APPLY A SINGLE PENNY.

00:28:55.867 --> 00:28:57.435
OF FEDERAL FUNDS TO THE

00:28:57.502 --> 00:28:58.903
ENFORCEMENT OF LAWS.

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:02.507
THAT -- PREVENT -- THE STATE'S

00:29:02.574 --> 00:29:03.641
FROM IMPLEMENTING THEIR OWN

00:29:03.708 --> 00:29:05.043
STATE LAWS ARE AUTHORIZED TO USE

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:07.712
DISTRIBUTION POSITION POSSESSION.

00:29:07.779 --> 00:29:09.514
OR CULTIVATION OF MEDICAL

00:29:09.581 --> 00:29:11.416
MARIJUANA SO WE HAVE KIND OF

00:29:11.483 --> 00:29:12.917
IT'S LIKE A A PROMISE FROM THE

00:29:12.984 --> 00:29:14.419
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

00:29:14.486 --> 00:29:15.920
THE STATE'S YOU DO WHICH ONES

00:29:15.987 --> 00:29:17.856
BUT SHOULD SHOULD THAT CHANGE.

00:29:17.922 --> 00:29:20.692
IT IT IT EXPOSES ALL OUR LAWS.

00:29:20.758 --> 00:29:23.161
AND AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OUR

00:29:23.228 --> 00:29:24.996
LAWS WOULD PRETTY MUCH BE BE PUT

00:29:25.063 --> 00:29:26.664
IN JEOPARDY AND JUST LIKE.

00:29:26.731 --> 00:29:29.400
THE WAY WE HAVE LEGISLATED ON

00:29:29.467 --> 00:29:34.506
THOSE LAWS -- WE WILL WE WILL DO

00:29:34.572 --> 00:29:36.307
THE SAME FOR THIS BILL NOTHING

00:29:36.374 --> 00:29:38.643
DIFFERENT NOTHING UNIQUE -- SAME

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:40.044
WAY.

00:29:40.111 --> 00:29:42.046
BUT IT IT IT JUST IN MY OPINION

00:29:42.113 --> 00:29:43.982
AND WHATEVER MY OPINIONS WORTH

00:29:44.048 --> 00:29:45.316
IN THE OPINION OF MANY OTHER

00:29:45.383 --> 00:29:48.019
PEOPLE IN IN THIS INDUSTRY RIGHT

00:29:48.086 --> 00:29:48.553
PROBABLY SHARE WE SHARE MY

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:49.687
OPINION.

00:29:49.754 --> 00:29:51.456
THAT THERE IS A TREND TO TOWARD

00:29:51.523 --> 00:29:53.658
THE OPPOSITE MORE -- EVIDENCES

00:29:53.725 --> 00:29:55.226
SHOW WE NEED THAT MARIJUANA HAS

00:29:55.293 --> 00:29:57.529
BENEFICIAL USES AND AND DOESN'T

00:29:57.595 --> 00:29:58.997
THAN IT DOES NOT HAVE

00:29:59.063 --> 00:30:00.165
DETRIMENTAL USES.

00:30:00.231 --> 00:30:02.467
AND AND MORE STATES ARE ADOPTING

00:30:02.534 --> 00:30:04.469
LAWS I MEAN CALIFORNIA WAS FIRST

00:30:04.536 --> 00:30:06.237
THE FIRST TWENTY YEARS AGO NOW

00:30:06.304 --> 00:30:07.739
WE HAVE THIRTY THREE STATES.

00:30:07.805 --> 00:30:08.706
NOW WE HAVE THE FEDERAL

00:30:08.773 --> 00:30:09.674
GOVERNMENT SAYING WE'RE NOT

00:30:09.741 --> 00:30:10.875
GOING TO FORCE LAWS.

00:30:10.942 --> 00:30:12.377
AND TO THAT AFFECT I THINK WE'RE

00:30:12.443 --> 00:30:14.012
HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION

00:30:14.078 --> 00:30:16.514
BUT SHOULD ANYTHING CHANGE OF MY

00:30:16.581 --> 00:30:17.248
WORDS OF THE THE PRINT WILL BE

00:30:17.315 --> 00:30:17.949
THERE.

00:30:18.016 --> 00:30:19.951
AND AND I WILL I WOULD NOT SEND

00:30:20.018 --> 00:30:22.053
A BILL TO THE GOVERNOR THAT IS

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:23.154
NOT ON SOLID FOOTING.

00:30:23.221 --> 00:30:25.156
I DON'T AND I DON'T DOUBT THAT I

00:30:25.223 --> 00:30:26.658
DON'T DOUBT THAT -- THAT THE

00:30:26.724 --> 00:30:28.159
LETTER THAT YOU HAVE IS VALID I

00:30:28.226 --> 00:30:29.527
DON'T DOUBT THAT AND THE

00:30:29.594 --> 00:30:30.728
ADMINISTRATION IN PREVIOUS

00:30:30.795 --> 00:30:32.130
ADMINISTRATION HAS SAID THAT

00:30:32.197 --> 00:30:33.131
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO ENFORCE IT.

00:30:33.198 --> 00:30:33.765
IT DOESN'T MEAN THE

00:30:33.831 --> 00:30:35.500
ADMINISTRATION CHANGES EVERY

00:30:35.567 --> 00:30:37.168
FOUR YEARS OR EVERY YEARS.

00:30:37.235 --> 00:30:39.337
AND SO AGAIN -- JUST THE

00:30:39.404 --> 00:30:41.406
QUESTION I I THINK IT'S VERY

00:30:41.472 --> 00:30:43.174
BENEFICIAL I THINK THAT -- THESE

00:30:43.241 --> 00:30:44.776

BENEFICIAL TO THE PATIENT AND SO

00:30:52.517 --> 00:30:53.551
LIKE I SAID I AM VERY

00:30:53.618 --> 00:30:54.686
SYMPATHETIC AND I DO WANT TO

00:30:54.752 --> 00:30:56.054

00:30:57.388 --> 00:30:58.623
AND HAVE YOUR WORD THAT THAT

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:00.592
LANGUAGE WILL BE INSERTED TO BE

00:31:00.658 --> 00:31:01.993
ABLE TO PROTECT THESE FACILITIES

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:04.362
THAT GET FEDERAL FUNDING SO IF

00:31:04.429 --> 00:31:05.730

DEFICIENCIES.

00:49:29.866 --> 00:49:31.435
UNFORTUNATELY THE DEPARTMENT'S

CURRENT ENFORCEMENT MEASURES ARE

00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:34.705
SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH.

HOWEVER THIS PERIODIC CHECK IS

00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:45.148

00:50:55.385 --> 00:50:58.321

00:51:02.826 --> 00:51:04.060
THESE RATIOS ARE INTENDED TO

00:51:07.531 --> 00:51:08.832
OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS.

00:51:08.899 --> 00:51:10.167
HOWEVER THE ENFORCEMENT

00:51:10.233 --> 00:51:12.102
MECHANISM FOR TITLE TWENTY TWO

00:51:12.169 --> 00:51:13.737
REGULATIONS NEED TO BE FIXED AND

00:51:13.804 --> 00:51:14.771
STRENGTHENS.

00:51:14.838 --> 00:51:16.173
CURRENTLY THE PENALTIES FOR

00:51:16.239 --> 00:51:17.941
VIOLATING THE LAW ARE NEARLY

00:51:18.008 --> 00:51:20.444
NONEXISTENT.

00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:21.878
IN FACT MOST OF THE TIME WHEN

00:51:21.945 --> 00:51:23.380
THE HOSPITAL'S FOUND TO BE IN

00:51:23.447 --> 00:51:24.514
VIOLATION OF THE NURSE TO

PATIENT RATIOS CITY PH GIVES

00:51:26.716 --> 00:51:28.585

00:51:28.652 --> 00:51:29.953
CORRECTION.

00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:32.389
SURPRISINGLY THERE IS NO LIMIT

00:51:32.456 --> 00:51:33.690
ON HOW MANY PLANS OF CORRECTION

00:51:33.757 --> 00:51:35.725
A HOSPITAL CAN GET AND MOST IF

NOT ALL HOSPITALS ARE NEVER FIND.

00:51:38.428 --> 00:51:40.397
THIS IS WHY HOSPITALS ARE

00:51:40.464 --> 00:51:41.765
WILLING TO CONTINUOUSLY BREAK

00:51:41.832 --> 00:51:43.333
THE LAW AND PUT PATIENT SAFETY

00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:44.701

00:51:44.768 --> 00:51:46.903
AS A NURSE I CAN TELL YOU THAT

00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:48.438
VALUE TO COMPLY WITH NURSE

00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:58.315
NURSE STAFFING RATIOS AND HOW

00:51:58.381 --> 00:52:00.016
THEY PROTECT THE HEALTH AND

00:52:00.083 --> 00:52:02.052
SAFETY OF PATIENTS. FOR EXAMPLE

00:52:02.118 --> 00:52:03.453

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:05.021
PRESS CONFERENCE KATHY A

00:52:08.391 --> 00:52:09.826
SECONDARY ILLNESSES.

00:52:09.893 --> 00:52:11.328
AS A DIRECT RESULT OF

DANGEROUSLY.

00:52:12.562 --> 00:52:14.698
LOW STAFFING LEVELS.

00:52:14.764 --> 00:52:16.533
IMAGINE IF THAT PATIENT WAS YOUR

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:17.868
MOTHER YOUR FATHER.

00:52:17.934 --> 00:52:21.271
WIFE HUSBAND SHALL OR YOURSELF.

00:52:21.338 --> 00:52:23.206
THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE TODAY.

00:52:23.273 --> 00:52:24.841
CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO PROTECT OUR

00:52:24.908 --> 00:52:26.510
PATIENTS BETTER AND ENSURE THAT

00:52:26.576 --> 00:52:27.577

GREATER FOR A HOSPITAL THE TO

00:59:54.490 --> 00:59:55.825

DEPARTMENT EVERY DAY THAT ARE

00:59:58.194 --> 01:00:01.297
CARED FOR IN OUR HOSPITALS.

01:00:01.364 --> 01:00:02.966
AS YOU ALL KNOW CON HOSPITALS

01:00:03.032 --> 01:00:05.301
ARE COMPLICATED ENVIRONMENTS WE

01:00:05.368 --> 01:00:07.136
WE ASKED OUR HOSPITALS -- YOU

01:00:07.203 --> 01:00:08.871
KNOW AN AVERAGE TWO HUNDRED BED

01:00:08.938 --> 01:00:11.207
HOSPITAL HAS ELEVEN OR SO

01:00:11.274 --> 01:00:13.276
NURSING UNITS A HUNDRED AND

01:00:13.343 --> 01:00:15.912
FIFTY REGISTERED NURSES -- AND

01:00:15.979 --> 01:00:17.513
THAT'S EVERY SINGLE DAY THREE

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:19.549
HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS A YEAR.

01:00:19.615 --> 01:00:21.851
SO AT ANY WITH THIS BILL THE

01:00:21.918 --> 01:00:23.319
DIFFICULTY WITH THIS BILL REALLY

01:00:23.386 --> 01:00:26.289
IS A COUPLE OF THINGS ONE IS AT

01:00:26.356 --> 01:00:28.191
ALL TIMES EVERY MINUTE EVERY

01:00:28.257 --> 01:00:29.759
SECOND OF EVERY DAY.

01:00:29.826 --> 01:00:31.260
SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THOSE

01:00:31.327 --> 01:00:32.595
HUNDRED FIFTY EMPLOYEES.

01:00:32.662 --> 01:00:35.031
DRIVING THE FREEWAYS TO GET TO

01:00:35.098 --> 01:00:37.433
WORK IF THERE'S A CAR ACCIDENT.

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:39.068
OR A SICK CHILD THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:00:39.135 --> 01:00:40.303
DROPPED OFF AT GRANDMA'S HOUSE

01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:42.338
INSTEAD OF SCHOOL AND THAT NURSE

01:00:42.405 --> 01:00:44.040
IS FIVE MINUTES LATE.

01:00:44.107 --> 01:00:46.009
THAT'S A PENALTY UNDER THIS BILL.

01:00:46.075 --> 01:00:48.177
SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT HOW JUST

01:00:48.244 --> 01:00:49.379
HOW COMPLICATED -- THESE THINGS

01:00:49.445 --> 01:00:52.849
ARE -- ADDITIONALLY THE

01:00:52.915 --> 01:00:54.684
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAS

01:00:54.751 --> 01:00:56.452
A REGULATORY STRUCTURE THAT

01:00:56.519 --> 01:01:00.189
ALLOWS FOR HOSPITALS TO BE FIND --

01:01:00.256 --> 01:01:01.891
UNDER A VARIETY OF CIRCUMSTANCES

01:01:01.958 --> 01:01:03.192
AND I WANT TO COMPLIMENT --

01:01:03.259 --> 01:01:05.695
COMMITTEE STAFF OF FOR THE

01:01:05.762 --> 01:01:07.130
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND REALLY

01:01:07.196 --> 01:01:09.799
THE EXISTING REGULATIONS ALLOW A

01:01:09.866 --> 01:01:11.801
FINE FOR EVERYTHING FROM AN

01:01:11.868 --> 01:01:14.103
IMMEDIATE JEOPARDY AND THE DEATH

01:01:14.170 --> 01:01:16.839
OF THE PATIENT -- TO SOMETHING

01:01:16.906 --> 01:01:18.908
WHERE THERE'S NO ACTUAL HARM TO

01:01:18.975 --> 01:01:20.543
THE PIT TAKE TO THE PATIENT BUT

01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:22.345
POTENTIAL FOR MORE THAN MINIMAL

01:01:22.412 --> 01:01:23.212
HARM.

01:01:23.279 --> 01:01:25.548
SO THERE'S A WIDE VARIETY OF

01:01:25.615 --> 01:01:27.550
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THE

01:01:27.617 --> 01:01:29.419
DEPARTMENT CAN CURRENTLY FIND A

01:01:29.485 --> 01:01:32.488
HOSPITAL FOR BUT IT'S BASED ON

01:01:32.555 --> 01:01:33.456
MANY FACTORS THAT THE

01:01:33.523 --> 01:01:35.458
LEGISLATION THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:01:35.525 --> 01:01:36.926
PUT INTO.

01:01:36.993 --> 01:01:38.828
THE ENACTING BILL THAT THE

01:01:38.895 --> 01:01:40.596
DEPARTMENT NEEDS TO LOOK AT IN

01:01:40.663 --> 01:01:42.999
ORDER TO CREATE THAT FINE AND SO

01:01:43.066 --> 01:01:44.534
IT TAKES IN IT REQUIRES THE

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:45.568
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO

01:01:45.635 --> 01:01:48.137
TAKE INTO THE TOTALITY OF ALL OF

01:01:48.204 --> 01:01:49.639
THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

01:01:49.705 --> 01:01:51.240
AROUND THE EVENT THAT HAPPENED

01:01:51.307 --> 01:01:53.910
RATHER THAN A NURSE HAVING TO

01:01:53.976 --> 01:01:55.445
STEP AWAY FROM PATIENT CARE FOR

01:01:55.511 --> 01:01:57.113
A MOMENT BECAUSE THEIR CHILD'S

01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:59.615
SCHOOL -- HAS CALLED WITH A

01:01:59.682 --> 01:02:00.583
PROBLEM.

01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:02.118
SO WE THINK THAT THE STRICT

01:02:02.185 --> 01:02:04.253
LIABILITY STANDARDS THAT APPEARS

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:06.422

01:02:06.489 --> 01:02:10.093
INCREASE FINES INCREDIBLY -- FLU

01:02:10.159 --> 01:02:12.095
SEASON AND FOR NURSES CALL IN

01:02:12.161 --> 01:02:13.362
SICK AND THE HOSPITALS ARE

01:02:13.429 --> 01:02:15.331
SCRAMBLING TO CALL IN OTHERS

01:02:15.398 --> 01:02:16.899
ASKING OTHER NURSES TO STAY

01:02:16.966 --> 01:02:19.135
LATER -- WILL JUST INCREASE THE

01:02:19.202 --> 01:02:21.704
FINES AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE

01:02:21.771 --> 01:02:22.071
OPPOSE THE BILL.

01:02:22.138 --> 01:02:23.739

01:02:44.227 --> 01:02:46.095
NURSES STEP OFF THE FLOOR FOR A

01:02:46.162 --> 01:02:48.397
MYRIAD OF REASONS -- AND WE MAY

01:02:48.464 --> 01:02:49.832

01:11:58.013 --> 01:12:00.182
FIND OUT THAT AND A NURSE GOT

01:12:00.249 --> 01:12:01.950
CALLED BECAUSE SCHOOLS THE

01:12:02.017 --> 01:12:03.352
SCHOOL CALLED I HAD AN EMPLOYEE

01:12:03.419 --> 01:12:04.887
HERE AT THIS IF THE BUILDING TO

01:12:04.953 --> 01:12:06.121
SEE OTHER DAY THE SCHOOL CALLED

01:12:06.188 --> 01:12:06.755
AND SAID YOU KNOW.

01:12:06.822 --> 01:12:07.523
YOU'RE SENDS REALLY SICK YOU

01:12:07.589 --> 01:12:08.924
HAVE TO LEAVE AND COME PICK HIM

01:12:08.991 --> 01:12:10.059
UP SO SHE LEFT.

01:12:10.125 --> 01:12:11.393
SO IF YOU HAVE THAT SITUATION

01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:12.961
AND A NURSES OFF THE FLOOR THE

01:12:13.028 --> 01:12:14.363
NEW WOULD BE OUT OF COMPLIANCE.

01:12:14.430 --> 01:12:17.166
A RIGHT NOW THE THE ENFORCEMENT

01:12:17.232 --> 01:12:18.400
AGENCY COULD MY UNDERSTANDING IS

01:12:18.467 --> 01:12:20.469
COULD SAY WELL YOU KNOW THIS

01:12:20.536 --> 01:12:21.570
LADY JUST LEFT FOR THIS NURSES

01:12:21.637 --> 01:12:22.838
LEFT FIVE MINUTES AGO.

01:12:22.905 --> 01:12:24.239
AND THIS PERSON WAS OFF THE

01:12:24.306 --> 01:12:25.307
FLOOR GOING TO THE BATHROOM SO

01:12:25.374 --> 01:12:26.608
THEREFORE WE CAN SAY THERE'S NO

01:12:26.675 --> 01:12:27.443
FINE.

01:12:27.509 --> 01:12:29.111
AND MY UNDERSTAND IS BILL DOES

01:12:29.178 --> 01:12:30.846
NOT ALLOW DISCRETION IS THAT

01:12:30.913 --> 01:12:32.514
TRUE NO THAT'S AND THAT'S NOT

01:12:32.581 --> 01:12:33.882
TRUE AT ALL FOR ME SENATOR

01:12:33.949 --> 01:12:36.552
ABSOLUTELY -- AS I SAID BEFORE

01:12:36.618 --> 01:12:37.619
THAT THE HOSPITAL MUST

01:12:37.686 --> 01:12:39.154
DEMONSTRATE THEIR BEST EFFORTS

01:12:39.221 --> 01:12:41.256
SO IF SOMEONE LEAVES OFF THE

01:12:41.323 --> 01:12:43.792
FLOOR IF SOMEONE IS LACTATING --

01:12:43.859 --> 01:12:45.294
IF SOMEONE HAS LEE BECAUSE

01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:46.528
THEY'RE SICK OF HAVE TO GO PICK

01:12:46.595 --> 01:12:47.996
UP AN ILL CHILD.

01:12:48.063 --> 01:12:49.465
I WOULD THINK THAT THE HOSPITAL

01:12:49.531 --> 01:12:50.899
CALLING TO TRY AND BRING NURSES

01:12:50.966 --> 01:12:52.901
IN TO IMMEDIATELY FILL THAT

01:12:52.968 --> 01:12:55.104
POSITION WOULD BE A BEST EFFORT

01:12:55.170 --> 01:12:58.774
IT ALSO ALSO TO THE OPPOSITION'S --

01:12:58.841 --> 01:13:00.843
SENATOR STONE'S QUESTION AND IT

01:13:00.909 --> 01:13:02.678
ISN'T FOR EMERGENCIES THAT SAYS

01:13:02.745 --> 01:13:04.046
MùT OR OVER WHAT INSTANCES

01:13:04.113 --> 01:13:06.215
WHERE A NURSE GET SICK OR

01:13:06.281 --> 01:13:07.783
INJURED ON THE JOB AND AN

01:13:07.850 --> 01:13:09.218
INSPECTION IS UNDER WAY.

01:13:09.284 --> 01:13:10.552
THE HOSPITAL JUST MUST

01:13:10.619 --> 01:13:12.521
DEMONSTRATE PROMPT EFFORTS WERE

01:13:12.588 --> 01:13:14.957
MADE SO RATHER THAN JUST

01:13:15.023 --> 01:13:16.692
ALLOWING THAT SHIFT TO GO ON

01:13:16.759 --> 01:13:18.293
FILLED WE ARE ASKING THAT THE

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:20.095
HOSPITAL MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO

01:13:20.162 --> 01:13:25.601
FILL THAT SHIFT AND GET BACK

01:13:25.667 --> 01:13:27.069
INTO COMPLIANCE.

01:13:27.136 --> 01:13:28.003
SORRY IS THERE ARE YOU UNDER THE

01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:28.637
IMPRESSION CENTER LEAVE IT AT

01:13:28.704 --> 01:13:29.505
THE HOSPITAL DOESN'T MAKE EVERY

01:13:29.571 --> 01:13:31.006
ABSOLUTELY MY DAUGHTER GETS

01:13:31.073 --> 01:13:32.141
CALLED IN ON SHIPS THAT ARE HER

01:13:32.207 --> 01:13:33.208
SHIFT WITH TIME.

01:13:33.275 --> 01:13:35.043
NOT NOT EVERY HOSPITAL OBVIOUSLY

01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:36.678
EMMA BUT WE WOULDN'T IT WE WILL

01:13:36.745 --> 01:13:38.280
I WOULDN'T BE HERE AGAIN WITH

01:13:38.347 --> 01:13:39.248
THIS BILL IF THERE WASN'T A

01:13:39.314 --> 01:13:41.016
PROBLEM IF THERE WAS NOT A

01:13:41.083 --> 01:13:42.217
COMPLIANCE PROBLEM.

01:13:42.284 --> 01:13:43.719
WE INTRODUCE THE BILL TWO YEARS

01:13:43.786 --> 01:13:44.586
AGO BECAUSE THERE WAS A

01:13:44.653 --> 01:13:46.121
COMPLIANCE PROBLEM THE GOVERNOR

01:13:46.188 --> 01:13:48.657
VETOED IT BUT I FEEL SO STRONGLY

01:13:48.724 --> 01:13:50.659
AND PASSIONATELY ABOUT PEOPLE'S

01:13:50.726 --> 01:13:52.094
CARE PEOPLE'S HEALTH CARE.

01:13:52.161 --> 01:13:53.562
I'VE HAD LOVED ONES IN THE

01:13:53.629 --> 01:13:55.597
HOSPITAL I KNOW WE YOU KNOW THAT

01:13:55.664 --> 01:13:56.899
WE HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION

01:13:56.965 --> 01:13:59.434
THERE'S TWO HUNDRED AND SOME ODD

01:13:59.501 --> 01:14:00.035
THOUSAND OUR SHIPS AND WHATNOT

01:14:00.102 --> 01:14:02.538
IN ONLY. SIX HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR

01:14:02.604 --> 01:14:03.906
ALLEGATIONS REPORT TO CD EIGHT

01:14:03.972 --> 01:14:06.141
CITY PH BUT WHAT IF YOUR LOVED

01:14:06.208 --> 01:14:07.743
ONE WAS ONE OF THOSE SIX HUNDRED

01:14:07.810 --> 01:14:09.578
AND THIRTY FOUR TIMES WHEN

01:14:09.645 --> 01:14:11.380
SOMEONE WAS NOT WHEN THE

01:14:11.446 --> 01:14:12.548
HOSPITALS OUT OF COMPLIANCE.

01:14:12.614 --> 01:14:14.016
NOT EVERY HOSPITALS OUT OF

01:14:14.082 --> 01:14:15.951
COMPLIANCE BUT THERE ARE ENOUGH

01:14:16.018 --> 01:14:20.322
HOSPITALS OUT OF COMPLAINTS

01:14:20.389 --> 01:14:20.889
THAT'S WHY I THINK THERE'S A

01:14:20.956 --> 01:14:21.323
NEED FOR THE BILL.

01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:21.990
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT ON THE

01:14:22.057 --> 01:14:22.591
OPPOSITE SIDE OF THAT IF YOU

01:14:22.658 --> 01:14:23.859
FIND THESE HOSPITALS SIXTY

01:14:23.926 --> 01:14:24.927
THOUSAND DOLLARS PER INCIDENT

01:14:24.993 --> 01:14:27.262
WHEN THERE'S JUST A NURSE IT'S

01:14:27.329 --> 01:14:28.697
LATE FOR WORK.

01:14:28.764 --> 01:14:30.165
OR SOMEBODY HAS LEFT THE FLOOR

01:14:30.232 --> 01:14:31.767
SOMETIMES AS HOSPITALS WILL BE

01:14:31.834 --> 01:14:33.202
ABLE TO SURVIVE THOSE PENALTIES

01:14:33.268 --> 01:14:35.704
AND FINES AND THEN WE HAVE ZERO

01:14:35.771 --> 01:14:37.439
HEALTH CARE SERVICE AND I DO

01:14:37.506 --> 01:14:38.774
APPRECIATE THE RULE EXEMPTION

01:14:38.841 --> 01:14:40.475
BECAUSE A LOT OF MY DISTRICT IS

01:14:40.542 --> 01:14:41.977
RULE.

01:14:42.044 --> 01:14:44.446
I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION -- MY

01:14:44.513 --> 01:14:46.248
COLLEAGUE KINDA HIGHLIGHTED ON

01:14:46.315 --> 01:14:47.015
IT BUT I GUESS MY QUESTION IS IS

01:14:47.082 --> 01:14:47.783
THAT.

01:14:47.850 --> 01:14:49.351
IS THIS ANOTHER MECHANISM THAT

01:14:49.418 --> 01:14:50.252
CAN BE USED AGAINST THE

01:14:50.319 --> 01:14:52.120
HOSPITALS IN LABOR DISPUTE SO

01:14:52.187 --> 01:14:54.857
BASICALLY YOU HAVEN'T 90% OF

01:14:54.923 --> 01:14:56.358
YOUR NURSES WALK OFF THE FLOOR.

01:14:56.425 --> 01:14:57.626
AND BECAUSE THERE'S A LABOR

01:14:57.693 --> 01:14:59.294
DISPUTE IN THE HOSPITAL WAS

01:14:59.361 --> 01:15:01.630
RESPONSIBLE -- FOR MAKING SURE

01:15:01.697 --> 01:15:04.533
THAT THE NURSES RATIO IS MATT.

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:06.501
AND IT'S AN INCIDENT THAT CAUSED

01:15:06.568 --> 01:15:08.070
BY THE NURSES ARE THE

01:15:08.136 --> 01:15:09.338
INDIVIDUALS THEMSELVES.

01:15:09.404 --> 01:15:10.439
AND THAT MAKES IT REALLY

01:15:10.505 --> 01:15:11.573
DIFFICULT FOR THE HOSPITALS TO

01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:15.077
COMPLY SO IS THERE AN EXEMPTION.

01:15:15.143 --> 01:15:16.745
FOR SELF IMPOSED.

01:15:16.812 --> 01:15:17.880
THERE IS A RATIO KNOWN ON

01:15:17.946 --> 01:15:20.449
EXEMPTION BUT I WOULD SAY THIS.

01:15:20.515 --> 01:15:22.150
EVERY NURSE I'VE EVER MET ALL

01:15:22.217 --> 01:15:23.585
THE NURSES THAT ARE HERE I

01:15:23.652 --> 01:15:24.953
CANNOT IMAGINE ANY OF THEM

01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:26.755
WALKING OFF THE JOB AND RISKING

01:15:26.822 --> 01:15:28.657
PATIENT SAFETY OUR PATIENTS

01:15:28.724 --> 01:15:30.926
LIVES OVER LABOR DISPUTE.

01:15:30.993 --> 01:15:31.960
THEY WOULD NOT HAVE GONE INTO

01:15:32.027 --> 01:15:33.295
NURSING IF THEY DID NOT CARE

01:15:33.362 --> 01:15:36.231
DEEPLY ABOUT EVERY SINGLE PERSON

01:15:36.298 --> 01:15:38.066
THAT THEY ARE CARING FOR SO

01:15:38.133 --> 01:15:39.668
THERE IS NO EXEMPTION NO MA'AM

01:15:39.735 --> 01:15:41.203
THERE IS NOT BUT I WOULD BE

01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:43.372
SHOCKED IF NURSES WALKED OFF THE

01:15:43.438 --> 01:15:44.673
JOB AND JEOPARDIZED.

01:15:44.740 --> 01:15:46.341
PATIENTS HEALTH OVER LABOR

01:15:46.408 --> 01:15:47.910
DISPUTE I CAN GIVE YOU A

01:15:47.976 --> 01:15:49.444
HOSPITAL WHERE NURSES DID STRIKE

01:15:49.511 --> 01:15:51.380
OKAY AND SO -- I DO HAVE A

01:15:51.446 --> 01:15:53.749

01:17:53.168 --> 01:17:55.303
TERMS OF STAFFING YOU SHOULD YOU

01:17:55.370 --> 01:17:56.138
NEED TO HAVE.

01:17:56.204 --> 01:17:57.439
YEAH AT LEAST A LITTLE RESERVE

01:17:57.506 --> 01:17:59.341
THERE BECAUSE THINGS DO HAPPEN I

01:17:59.408 --> 01:18:00.842
MEAN LEARN HEALTHCARE THINGS

01:18:00.909 --> 01:18:02.577
HAPPENED UNEXPECTEDLY.

01:18:02.644 --> 01:18:04.846
AND THEY HAPPENED THE UNEXPECTED

01:18:04.913 --> 01:18:06.815
HAPPENS SO FREQUENTLY IT NEEDS

01:18:06.882 --> 01:18:08.350
TO BE EXPECTED.

01:18:08.417 --> 01:18:09.851
RIGHT I MEAN IT JUST DOESN'T TO

01:18:09.918 --> 01:18:12.988
DAY AND YEAH WE CAN TALK ABOUT

01:18:13.055 --> 01:18:14.356
EXACTLY HOW MUCH AND IN EXACTLY

01:18:14.423 --> 01:18:15.757
IN THE AND I APPRECIATE US

01:18:15.824 --> 01:18:17.225
EARLIER YOU MENTIONED THAT --

01:18:17.292 --> 01:18:18.493
YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S BEST EFFORT

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:19.661
RIGHT AND I THINK THIS IS THE

01:18:19.728 --> 01:18:20.962
THIS IS PART OF THE BEST EFFORT

01:18:21.029 --> 01:18:22.330
NOW DO YOU DOREEN WE'RE NOT

01:18:22.397 --> 01:18:23.999
LOOKING AT WE NEED TO HAVE TO

01:18:24.066 --> 01:18:25.534
NURSES FOR EVERYONE AND IT'S AT

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:27.069
BUT YOU DO YOU HAVE DO YOU HAVE

01:18:27.135 --> 01:18:28.103
TO HAVE AT LEAST.

01:18:28.170 --> 01:18:29.504
A LITTLE BIT OF A WITH THE

01:18:29.571 --> 01:18:33.875
RESERVE BECAUSE IF NOTHING ELSE.

01:18:33.942 --> 01:18:34.910
YOU KNOW THE THINGS HAPPEN RIGHT

01:18:34.976 --> 01:18:35.544
SO THE HOSPITAL'S A LITTLE LET

01:18:35.610 --> 01:18:36.878
MORE EMPTY YOU KNOW I'D BE JUST

01:18:36.945 --> 01:18:38.380
STAFFING RIGHT AT THE EDGE.

01:18:38.447 --> 01:18:40.849
AND SO I I THINK THAT WHEN WE

01:18:40.916 --> 01:18:41.883
STARTED TO TALK ABOUT LIKE

01:18:41.950 --> 01:18:43.452
LITTLE THINGS OUT YOU HAVE A BIG

01:18:43.518 --> 01:18:44.719
SYSTEMATIC PROFIT SO I THINK

01:18:44.786 --> 01:18:46.021
THAT THE ISSUE IS IS THAT WE

01:18:46.088 --> 01:18:47.522
WANT TO BE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE

01:18:47.589 --> 01:18:50.125
DOING IT IN A SYSTEMATIC WAY AND

01:18:50.192 --> 01:18:51.493
TO ME ACTUALLY.

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:52.894
AS SOMEONE WHO'S HAD TO ENFORCE

01:18:52.961 --> 01:18:54.129
WORK HOURS RESIDENCIES LIKE

01:18:54.196 --> 01:18:55.497
SOMEONE WHO STAFF JUST AT THE

01:18:55.564 --> 01:18:57.432
EDGE THAT'S A SYSTEMATIC PROBLEM

01:18:57.499 --> 01:18:58.400
THAT'S ACTUALLY SYSTEMATIC

01:18:58.467 --> 01:18:59.668
VIOLATIONS OF TECHNICALLY IS NOT

01:18:59.734 --> 01:19:00.735
A VIOLATION BECAUSE THEY WILL WE

01:19:00.802 --> 01:19:01.736
CAN CROSS THE LINE WE'RE RIGHT

01:19:01.803 --> 01:19:03.905
AT IT BUT THEN SOMETHING HAPPENS

01:19:03.972 --> 01:19:04.606
IT'S UPSET OVER THAT.

01:19:04.673 --> 01:19:05.707
MEANSYOU SYSTEMATICALLY

01:19:05.774 --> 01:19:07.342
DESIGNED IT SO THAT YOU THAT

01:19:07.409 --> 01:19:08.543
WOULD HAPPEN GIVEN SPECIALLY

01:19:08.610 --> 01:19:11.346
VARIATION.

01:19:11.413 --> 01:19:15.417
SO I MEAN I YEAH I I AM A I SO I

01:19:15.484 --> 01:19:17.385
CERTAINLY HEAR ABOUT AND NOW I

01:19:17.452 --> 01:19:18.120
KNOW I DON'T WANT HOSPITAL'S

01:19:18.186 --> 01:19:19.454
NICKEL AND DIME BUT THE SAME

01:19:19.521 --> 01:19:21.089
TIME I THINK THE FLIP SIDE THOSE

01:19:21.156 --> 01:19:22.791
EXPECTATION IS THAT THE

01:19:22.858 --> 01:19:25.527
INSTITUTIONS -- WHEN THEY WHEN

01:19:25.594 --> 01:19:26.995
YOU SEE A NURSE STAFFING RATIO

01:19:27.062 --> 01:19:28.430
YOU'RE NOT JUST STABBING EXACTLY

01:19:28.497 --> 01:19:30.465
AT THAT POINT OR JUST A LITTLE

01:19:30.532 --> 01:19:31.032
YOU NEED TO HAVE ENOUGH OF

01:19:31.099 --> 01:19:32.434
RESERVE TO SHOW THAT YOU'RE NOT

01:19:32.501 --> 01:19:34.169
CONSTANTLY CROSSING THAT LINE

01:19:34.236 --> 01:19:35.637
THAT IT THAT THAT SHOULD NOT BE

01:19:35.704 --> 01:19:36.204
THE NORMAL?

01:19:36.271 --> 01:19:37.439
THAT YOU'RE THAT EVERY LITTLE

01:19:37.506 --> 01:19:39.241
THING BECAUSE YOU NOW TO HAVE TO

01:19:39.307 --> 01:19:40.642
CROSS THAT LINE IT SHOULD BE

01:19:40.709 --> 01:19:44.846
LIKE VERY UNUSUAL EVENTS BECAUSE

01:19:44.913 --> 01:19:48.116
THE CAUSE THAT TO HAPPEN.

01:19:48.183 --> 01:19:48.850
READ DID YOU WANNA SAY SOMETHING

01:19:48.917 --> 01:19:49.618
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO SAY

01:19:49.684 --> 01:19:50.252
SOMETHING MANY OF OUR HOSPITALS

01:19:50.318 --> 01:19:51.453
TO STAFF OVER THE RATIO BECAUSE

01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:52.487
WE HAVE TO MANAGE MEAL AND REST

01:19:52.554 --> 01:19:54.856
BREAKS BUT DURING FLU SEASONS OR

01:19:54.923 --> 01:19:56.258
EVENTS WHERE THE HOSPITAL.

01:19:56.324 --> 01:19:57.726
MAY HAVE A PATIENT TURN OVER IT

01:19:57.792 --> 01:19:58.927
CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT I THINK

01:19:58.994 --> 01:20:00.629
THE FRUSTRATING PART IS THE WAY

01:20:00.695 --> 01:20:02.531
WE READ THE BILL THE REGULATORY

01:20:02.597 --> 01:20:04.533
SECTION REFERRED TO IS THE OUT

01:20:04.599 --> 01:20:05.834
ALL TIME SECTION IT DOES NOT

01:20:05.901 --> 01:20:07.569
REFER.

01:20:07.636 --> 01:20:08.136
TO THE SECTION SHE'S TALKING

01:20:08.203 --> 01:20:09.771
ABOUT IT IS THE AT ALL TIMES IN

01:20:09.838 --> 01:20:11.306
THERE ARE INSTANCES HAVING

01:20:11.373 --> 01:20:12.073
WORKED IN A HOSPITAL WHERE YOU

01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:13.041
KNOW.

01:20:13.108 --> 01:20:14.743
THAT YOU CAN HAVE NURSES STEP

01:20:14.809 --> 01:20:16.545
OFF THE FLOOR UNEXPECTEDLY AND

01:20:16.611 --> 01:20:18.680
IN THOSE INSTANCES WE STRUGGLE

01:20:18.747 --> 01:20:19.648
AND WE ARE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT

01:20:19.714 --> 01:20:21.283
THIS BILL COMBINED WITH OTHER

01:20:21.349 --> 01:20:22.651
OFFERS -- COULD COST OUR

01:20:22.717 --> 01:20:26.121
HOSPITAL SO I THINK IF THE GOAL

01:20:26.188 --> 01:20:28.256
IS TO GO AFTER VISUAL --

01:20:28.323 --> 01:20:30.025
OFFENDERS THAT'S ONE THING BUT

01:20:30.091 --> 01:20:31.226
THIS BILL THE WAY WE READ THAT

01:20:31.293 --> 01:20:33.028

I UNDERSTAND IT ALSO I MEAN WELL

01:20:36.531 --> 01:20:37.032
CERTAINLY.

01:20:37.098 --> 01:20:38.800
SOME IT IS ALSO A COMPLAINT

01:20:38.867 --> 01:20:40.602
DRIVEN THAT IT'S WE'RE TALKING

01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:42.737
ABOUT SECTIONS EVERY THREE YEARS

01:20:42.804 --> 01:20:43.405

CERTAIN SITUATIONS RIGHT OF

01:20:49.511 --> 01:20:51.846
WHICH ACTUALLY IF YOU HAD

01:20:51.913 --> 01:20:52.447
MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS THAT WOULD

01:20:52.514 --> 01:20:53.582
BE ONE FINE.

01:20:53.648 --> 01:20:56.218
THAT YOU CAN HAVE MULTIPLE LANES

01:20:56.284 --> 01:20:57.552

OF THESE THINGS BUT I THINK THE

01:21:03.091 --> 01:21:06.328
OVERALL -- I THINK WE NEED TO

01:21:06.394 --> 01:21:07.796

01:21:07.862 --> 01:21:10.298
ENFORCEMENT WHERE -- RECOGNIZING

USING YOUR BEST EFFORT IN MY

01:21:20.542 --> 01:21:22.410
MIND SO -- A SO I CERTAINLY

01:21:22.477 --> 01:21:23.878
THINK THE CONVERSATION NEEDS TO

CONTINUE.

01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:29.117
AND AND BUT YEAH I THINK.

01:21:40.795 --> 01:21:42.030
CHAIRMAN.

01:21:42.097 --> 01:21:43.465
I THINK YOU IN CAPS SLATED IT

01:21:43.531 --> 01:21:44.966
VERY WELL WHEN YOU SAID THAT

01:21:45.033 --> 01:21:46.401
WHEN YOUR STAFFING RIGHT AT THE

01:21:46.468 --> 01:21:48.236
EDGE THAT CAN LEAD TO A LOT OF

01:21:48.303 --> 01:21:49.070
PROBLEMS.

01:21:49.137 --> 01:21:51.873
pALWAYS WILLING AND OUR DOORS

01:21:51.940 --> 01:21:53.375
ALWAYS OPEN TO TALK TO

01:21:53.441 --> 01:21:55.143
OPPOSITION IF WE CAN GET TO SOME

01:21:55.210 --> 01:21:56.111
PLACE WHERE REYES A LITTLE

01:21:56.177 --> 01:21:57.779
HAPPIER LITTLE UNHAPPY WE'VE HAD

01:21:57.846 --> 01:21:59.247
A GOOD NEGOTIATION.

01:21:59.314 --> 01:22:01.549
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY I FEEL

01:22:01.616 --> 01:22:02.951
INCREDIBLY PASSIONATE ABOUT WHAT

01:22:03.018 --> 01:22:04.686

01:22:08.923 --> 01:22:09.557
NOT.

01:22:10.959 --> 01:22:12.494
THAT PATIENTS ARE SAFE BUT IT'S

01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:13.995
ALSO ABOUT MAKING SURE THE

01:22:14.062 --> 01:22:15.797
NURSES ARE SAFE BECAUSE THEY DO

01:22:15.864 --> 01:22:17.799
VERY HARD JOBS MUCH HARDER THAN

WHAT WE DO EVERY DAY AND

THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS

01:31:02.023 --> 01:31:03.624
BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE MONTH

QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS

01:49:22.422 --> 01:49:38.672
OF CENTER GROVE

01:49:39.139 --> 01:49:41.942
-- COULD YOU --

01:49:42.008 --> 01:49:43.777
JUST -- ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT

01:49:43.843 --> 01:49:46.313
MORE ABOUT WHAT THEY DO -- THAT

01:49:46.379 --> 01:49:47.547
IS MY UNDERSTANDING THESE --

01:49:47.614 --> 01:49:50.383
INTERNATIONALLY -- RECOGNIZE

01:49:50.450 --> 01:49:52.719
GROUP OF EXPERTS THAT ARE

01:49:52.786 --> 01:49:53.320
EVALUATING THAT THIS AYE SOON

01:49:53.386 --> 01:49:54.654
THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF SOME

01:49:54.721 --> 01:49:58.291
OF THESE -- FRAGRANCES -- AND

01:49:58.358 --> 01:50:00.760
THAT THE FDA HAS A ROLE AS WELL

01:50:00.827 --> 01:50:01.328
COULD YOU JUST ELABORATE ON

01:50:01.394 --> 01:50:01.561
THOSE.

01:50:01.628 --> 01:50:02.996
TWO ARE CERTAINLY -- OF THE

01:50:03.063 --> 01:50:04.764
RESEARCH INSTITUTE FRAGRANCE

01:50:04.831 --> 01:50:06.766
MATERIALS OPERATES COMPREHENSIVE

01:50:06.833 --> 01:50:09.903
REVIEW PROGRAM OF ALL COSMETIC --

01:50:09.970 --> 01:50:12.172
ALL FRAGRANCE INGREDIENTS -- IT

01:50:12.238 --> 01:50:14.607
IS A RESEARCH INSTITUTE WHICH

01:50:14.674 --> 01:50:18.278
HAS -- A EXPERT TO A PANEL OF A

01:50:18.345 --> 01:50:20.146
INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED

01:50:20.213 --> 01:50:23.183
EXPERTS -- THEY REPAIR REPORTS

01:50:23.249 --> 01:50:25.185
I'M IN THE EXPERTS -- OPINE ON

01:50:25.251 --> 01:50:28.021
THE SAFETY OF THESE -- ROOM --

01:50:28.088 --> 01:50:29.422
REVIEWS MAY RESULT IN A

01:50:29.489 --> 01:50:30.056
CONCLUSION THAT THE MATERIAL IS

01:50:30.123 --> 01:50:34.227
SAFE OF THAT THE MATERIAL IS

01:50:34.294 --> 01:50:35.628
SAFE WITH RESTRICTIONS OR THE

01:50:35.695 --> 01:50:36.963
MATERIAL IS PROHIBITED -- THOUGH

01:50:37.030 --> 01:50:38.198
WHOSE -- CONCLUSIONS ARE THEN

01:50:38.264 --> 01:50:39.099
ADVANCED THROUGH THE TRADE

01:50:39.165 --> 01:50:41.868
ASSOCIATION -- AND OUR OWN

01:50:41.935 --> 01:50:44.471
OBLIGATION OF MEMBERSHIP -- FOR

01:50:44.537 --> 01:50:47.107
MEMBERS WHICH REPRESENT OVER 90%

01:50:47.173 --> 01:50:49.509
OF THE OF FRAGRANCES SOLDO

01:50:49.576 --> 01:50:51.611
WORLDWIDE.

01:50:51.678 --> 01:50:53.313
ALSO IT IS ON THE FLOOR TATE OF

01:50:53.380 --> 01:50:57.851
A BODY OF WHICH CHAU PUBLISHES --

01:50:57.917 --> 01:51:01.221
THEY REPORTS IN -- IN PUBLIC --

01:51:01.287 --> 01:51:04.758
AND PEOPLE CAN REVIEW THEM ACT.

01:51:04.824 --> 01:51:07.861
SO A SENSE OF THE R. F. M. IS

01:51:07.927 --> 01:51:09.329
BEEN IN EXISTENCE -- I ASSUME

01:51:09.396 --> 01:51:19.172
FOR MANY YEARS -- HAS THERE BEEN

01:51:19.239 --> 01:51:21.441
ANY CASES OF ANY TOXICITIES --

01:51:21.508 --> 01:51:22.575
THAT HAVE RESULTED IN MORBIDITY

01:51:22.642 --> 01:51:23.777
OR MORTALITY ASSOCIATE WITH

01:51:23.843 --> 01:51:24.344
THOSE FRAGRANCES THAT WERE

01:51:24.411 --> 01:51:25.879
LISTED.

01:51:25.945 --> 01:51:27.247
OF I AM UNAWARE THAT THERE ARE

01:51:27.313 --> 01:51:28.782
ANY OKAY ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY

01:51:28.848 --> 01:51:30.016
INSTANCES.

01:51:30.083 --> 01:51:30.750
WHERE ANY COSMETICS OF BECAUSE

01:51:30.817 --> 01:51:31.684
MORBIDITY OR MORTALITY

01:51:31.751 --> 01:51:34.387
ASSOCIATED WITH?

01:51:34.454 --> 01:51:35.922
BRING THE MEN I MEAN WHEN I WHEN

01:51:35.989 --> 01:51:37.057
I WAS A PHARMACY SCHOOL THESE A

01:51:37.123 --> 01:51:38.191
SAFE YOU CAN IF YOU CAN BRING

01:51:38.258 --> 01:51:39.059
THAT IT'S IN YOUR BLOOD.

01:51:39.125 --> 01:51:41.561
SO -- IN FACT IT KIND OF GOES --

01:51:41.628 --> 01:51:42.662
TO ONE OF THE LEVELS OF RECOVER

01:51:42.729 --> 01:51:44.597
OF RESEARCH -- SEE HERE -- FOR

01:51:44.664 --> 01:51:48.201
THE CDC IT SAYS -- LET'S SEE

01:51:48.268 --> 01:51:48.701
HERE [inaudible]

01:51:48.768 --> 01:51:50.737
THAT.

01:51:50.804 --> 01:51:54.474
IF IT'S A DESIGNATED W. IT'S

01:51:54.541 --> 01:51:56.309
JUST THE TAXES IN THE BLOOD OF

01:51:56.376 --> 01:51:58.912
THE YEAR AND IT DOESN'T -- SAY

01:51:58.978 --> 01:52:00.880
THAT FITS TOXIC OR OR NON TOXIC

01:52:00.947 --> 01:52:03.616
WE WE WE APPRECIATE THE REMOVAL

01:52:03.683 --> 01:52:05.518
OF THE CDC LIST WHICH IS EXACTLY

01:52:05.585 --> 01:52:07.520
THAT IT'S ASSEMBLY OF THE

01:52:07.587 --> 01:52:08.755
PRESENCE.

01:52:08.822 --> 01:52:09.689
OF THERE'S NO RISK ASSESSMENT

01:52:09.756 --> 01:52:11.691
DONE THERE'S NO SUGGESTION BY

01:52:11.758 --> 01:52:13.593
CDC THAT THE PRESENCE -- IS

01:52:13.660 --> 01:52:15.328
EITHER AN INDICATION THAT THE

01:52:15.395 --> 01:52:16.863
MATERIAL IS SAFE OR UNSAFE.

01:52:16.930 --> 01:52:18.798
WELL WE ARE FULLY CONFIDENT THAT

01:52:18.865 --> 01:52:20.767
THROUGH THE INDUSTRY

01:52:20.834 --> 01:52:23.002
RESPONSIBILITY AS WELL AS THE

01:52:23.069 --> 01:52:25.905
ASSESSMENT OF EXTERNAL OF REVIEW

01:52:25.972 --> 01:52:28.141
BODIES INCLUDING.

01:52:28.208 --> 01:52:29.809
OF THE REFORM OF GROUP FOR

01:52:29.876 --> 01:52:30.844
FRAGRANCES AS WELL AS THE

01:52:30.910 --> 01:52:32.378
COSMETIC INGREDIENT REVIEW FOR

01:52:32.445 --> 01:52:34.013
COST MEDIC INGREDIENTS TAT THE

01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:36.149
MATERIALS THAT ARE IN THE MARKET

01:52:36.216 --> 01:52:39.419
ARE SAFE THEY ARE USED SAFELY.

01:52:39.486 --> 01:52:41.187
OKAY AND THEN THE YOUNG LADY

01:52:41.254 --> 01:52:42.188
THAT REPRESENT A LOT OF THE

01:52:42.255 --> 01:52:44.190
FRAGRANCE COMPANIES CAN YOU TALK

01:52:44.257 --> 01:52:45.258
ABOUT THE UPPER PART TERRY

01:52:45.325 --> 01:52:46.960
SECRETS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN

01:52:47.026 --> 01:52:48.595
THOSE FRAGRANCES AND IF.

01:52:48.661 --> 01:52:50.163
THOSE INGREDIENTS THAT ARE

01:52:50.230 --> 01:52:55.535
MAKING UP THOSE FRAGRANCES ARE --

01:52:55.602 --> 01:52:58.438
PLACED ON BOTTLES FOR THE WORLD

01:52:58.505 --> 01:52:59.806
TO SEE -- WHAT WOULD STOP ANYONE

01:52:59.873 --> 01:53:00.840
IN THE WORLD FROM DUPLICATING

01:53:00.907 --> 01:53:02.075
THOSE?

01:53:02.142 --> 01:53:04.177
NON PATENTABLE -- INGREDIENTS

01:53:04.244 --> 01:53:05.445
RIGHT SURE -- YEAH AS YOU

01:53:05.512 --> 01:53:07.147
MENTIONED SO ARE -- FORMULATIONS

01:53:07.213 --> 01:53:10.083
ARE NOT PATENTABLE -- AND SO

01:53:10.150 --> 01:53:11.618
WHENEVER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW

01:53:11.684 --> 01:53:13.019
TO COMMUNICATE INGREDIENTS WITH

01:53:13.086 --> 01:53:14.320
CONSUMERS WERE REALLY ALSO

01:53:14.387 --> 01:53:15.788
CONSIDERING THAT COMMUNICATION

01:53:15.855 --> 01:53:17.157
IS GONNA GO TO OUR COMPETITORS

01:53:17.223 --> 01:53:19.359
RIGHT AND SO ONCE YOU HAVE YOUR

01:53:19.425 --> 01:53:20.460
SORT OF YOUR RECIPE OUT THERE IT

01:53:20.527 --> 01:53:20.894
DOESN'T.

01:53:20.960 --> 01:53:23.463
TAKE MUCH FOR THE SCIENTISTS

01:53:23.530 --> 01:53:23.997
THAT WORK FOR MAYBE YOUR

01:53:24.063 --> 01:53:25.365
COMPETITORS TO TO PIECE TOGETHER

01:53:25.431 --> 01:53:26.699
EXACTLY YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT OF

01:53:26.766 --> 01:53:27.634
THIS AND A LOT OF THAT AND GET

01:53:27.700 --> 01:53:30.436
VERY VERY CLOSE -- TO TO YOUR

01:53:30.503 --> 01:53:32.071
PROPRIETARY BLEND SO THAT'S WHY

01:53:32.138 --> 01:53:33.873
WE TAKE THESE -- CONSIDERATION

01:53:33.940 --> 01:53:35.808
SO ERIOUSLY WE CERTAINLY WANT

01:53:35.875 --> 01:53:37.076
CONSUMERS TO HAVE THE SAFETY

01:53:37.143 --> 01:53:38.578
INFORMATION THAT THEY THAT THEY

01:53:38.645 --> 01:53:40.013
NEED TO MAKE PURCHASING

01:53:40.079 --> 01:53:41.314
DECISIONS INFORMED PURCHASING

01:53:41.381 --> 01:53:43.249
DECISIONS BUT WE ALSO YOU KNOW

01:53:43.316 --> 01:53:44.384
THERE'S A LOT OF CONTACTS

01:53:44.450 --> 01:53:48.688
IMPORTANT GOES ALONG WITH THAT.

01:53:48.755 --> 01:53:51.191
OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:53:51.257 --> 01:53:52.025
OKAY THE CHAIR MY COLLEAGUE

01:53:52.091 --> 01:53:52.659
ASKED THEM THE QUESTION TAT I

01:53:52.725 --> 01:53:53.860
WAS CONCERNED ABOUT WHICH IS THE

01:53:53.927 --> 01:53:55.428
PATENTED ISSUE ONE THAT ON THE

01:53:55.495 --> 01:53:57.063
FRAGRANCE LINE SO I APPRECIATE

01:53:57.130 --> 01:53:59.232
THAT AND I HE ASKED MY QUESTION

01:53:59.299 --> 01:54:02.502
THANK YOU -- MITCHELL.

01:54:02.569 --> 01:54:05.238
THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- ENJOY

01:54:05.305 --> 01:54:07.507
THIS IS A COMPLEX ISSUE THAT HAS

01:54:07.574 --> 01:54:08.942
BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME.

01:54:09.008 --> 01:54:10.543
WE'VE TRIED TO ADDRESS IT BOTH

01:54:10.610 --> 01:54:13.213
LEGISLATIVELY IN THE BUDGET --

01:54:13.279 --> 01:54:16.049
AND WHAT'S CLEAR TO ME IS THAT

01:54:16.115 --> 01:54:18.551
IT'S AN ISSUE THAT'S THAT'S NOT

01:54:18.618 --> 01:54:19.485
GOING AWAY THAT THAT WE STILL

01:54:19.552 --> 01:54:21.621
HAVE CLEAR CORPS DIVISIONS

01:54:21.688 --> 01:54:24.891
WITHIN THE INDUSTRY -- THOSE IN

01:54:24.958 --> 01:54:25.391
THE HEALTH.

01:54:25.458 --> 01:54:27.227
OF TE PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE

01:54:27.293 --> 01:54:29.262
HEALTH CARE DELIVERY WORLD AND

01:54:29.329 --> 01:54:30.496
SO I THINK A SIMPLE.

01:54:30.563 --> 01:54:32.865
UP OR DOWN VOTE ON THIS BILL

01:54:32.932 --> 01:54:34.767
ISN'T GOING TO RESOLVE IT.

01:54:34.834 --> 01:54:36.302
I'M CURIOUS I HEARD IT WAS PUT I%

01:54:36.369 --> 01:54:38.371
WASPLEASANTLY SURPRISED BY TWO

01:54:38.438 --> 01:54:39.272
THINGS I THINK ABOUT DOES MY

01:54:39.339 --> 01:54:40.273
HISTORY IN THE LEGISLATURE

01:54:40.340 --> 01:54:41.908
LEGISLATURE HERE THIS ISSUE.

01:54:41.975 --> 01:54:43.643
NUMBER ONE THE SHEER NEW NUMBER

01:54:43.710 --> 01:54:45.111
OF COMPANIES IS A WHOLE NEW

01:54:45.178 --> 01:54:46.412
INDUSTRY THAT'S EMERGING QUITE

01:54:46.479 --> 01:54:48.548
FRANKLY THAT APPEARS TO WANT TO

01:54:48.615 --> 01:54:51.184
GIVE CONSUMERS AN ALTERNATIVE --

01:54:51.251 --> 01:54:52.952
AND SO THAT WAS DIFFERENT THAT

01:54:53.019 --> 01:54:54.687
I'VE NOTED.

01:54:54.754 --> 01:54:56.823
THE SECOND THING IS I TIP MY HAT

01:54:56.889 --> 01:54:57.957
TO YOU FOR ENGAGING IN A

01:54:58.024 --> 01:54:59.525
STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AND THAT THE

01:54:59.592 --> 01:55:01.127
OPPOSITE YOU COULD SAY THAT THEY

01:55:01.194 --> 01:55:02.562
ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED.

01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:03.896
I DON'T KNOW THAT I WAS TRACKING

01:55:03.963 --> 01:55:06.032
ALL OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU

01:55:06.099 --> 01:55:08.701
DIDN'T TAKE FROM MY HEARD WE'RE

01:55:08.768 --> 01:55:10.336
DEALING WITH TERMINOLOGY I

01:55:10.403 --> 01:55:11.504
APPRECIATE YOU DON'T WITH THE

01:55:11.571 --> 01:55:14.907
TERM TOXIC USE THAT I GET THAT --

01:55:14.974 --> 01:55:16.309
AND SO YOU REMOVE THE AISLES BUT

01:55:16.376 --> 01:55:17.744
IF THE OPPOSITION -- TO THE

01:55:17.810 --> 01:55:19.979
CHAIR COULD GIVE ME A HIGH LEVEL

01:55:20.046 --> 01:55:21.848
KIND OF SUMMARY OF THE CORE

01:55:21.914 --> 01:55:23.049
ISSUES.

01:55:23.116 --> 01:55:25.118
THAT HAVE NOT BEEN ADDRESSED IN

01:55:25.184 --> 01:55:27.387
THE AMENDMENTS -- BOTH THE

01:55:27.453 --> 01:55:29.656
COMMITTEE SUGGESTED AND THE

01:55:29.722 --> 01:55:34.260
CHAIR HAS AGREED TO TAKE.

01:55:34.327 --> 01:55:36.663
I WANT TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT'S

01:55:36.729 --> 01:55:38.197
THAT WHAT'S LEFT THE CURRENT GAS.

01:55:38.264 --> 01:55:39.399
AND YOU KNOW AND I AND I'M AND

01:55:39.465 --> 01:55:40.767
I'M ASKING THIS ISSUE LET ME ASK

01:55:40.833 --> 01:55:41.367
YOU THESE QUESTIONS OF PUSHING

01:55:41.434 --> 01:55:41.701
HARD ON THIS.

01:55:41.768 --> 01:55:43.603
BECAUSE I GET BOTH SIDES I ALSO

01:55:43.670 --> 01:55:45.538
REPRESENT A DISTRICT THAT HAS

01:55:45.605 --> 01:55:48.741
LIKE SEVEN MANUFACTURERS -- SO

01:55:48.808 --> 01:55:49.676
I'M.

01:55:49.742 --> 01:55:50.710
I NEED TO HEAR THE DIFFERENCE

01:55:50.777 --> 01:55:52.679
THANK YOU.

01:55:52.745 --> 01:55:54.681
WELL I THINK THE CORE ISSUE FOR

01:55:54.747 --> 01:55:57.717
US IS REALLY THE LISTS OF LISTS --

01:55:57.784 --> 01:56:00.019
AND WHETHER THEY ARE RELEVANT TO

01:56:00.086 --> 01:56:02.322
ASSESSING THE SAFETY OF OR THE

01:56:02.388 --> 01:56:05.725
RELEVANT TO INFORMING CONSUMERS

01:56:05.792 --> 01:56:07.627
OF IMPORTANT INFORMATION -- MANY

01:56:07.694 --> 01:56:09.762
OF THESE LISTS WE WE THINK ARE

01:56:09.829 --> 01:56:11.931

RESEARCH LISTS -- THERE --

01:56:18.004 --> 01:56:19.472
INGREDIENTS THAT SOMEONE WOULD

01:56:19.539 --> 01:56:21.541
LIKE TO TEST SOMETIME IN THE

01:56:21.607 --> 01:56:22.975
FUTURE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY

01:56:23.042 --> 01:56:25.478

01:56:31.084 --> 01:56:32.719
THAT CAME OUT OF DENMARK --

01:56:32.785 --> 01:56:34.454
WHICH DOESN'T TO FOLLOW THE

01:56:34.520 --> 01:56:35.955
WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION'S

01:56:36.022 --> 01:56:37.056
THAT'S BEEN REMOVED RIGHT LET'S

01:56:37.123 --> 01:56:38.691

01:56:38.758 --> 01:56:40.893
LISTS -- IN THERE THAT WE WOULD

01:56:40.960 --> 01:56:42.195
VERY MUCH LIKE TO DISCUSS

01:57:07.820 --> 01:57:10.256
ASKING MORE OR LESS BUT JUST

01:57:10.323 --> 01:57:12.091

01:58:42.148 --> 01:58:44.183

PUT ON THEIR OWN WEBSITES --

01:59:36.235 --> 01:59:37.303
WHAT BUT I THINK THE IDEA THAT

STATE MAY HAVE A REACTION FOR

01:59:55.288 --> 01:59:57.290

02:02:41.687 --> 02:02:43.723
THEY WOULD HAVE BUT I DO THINK

02:02:43.789 --> 02:02:44.523
IT.

02:02:44.590 --> 02:02:46.058
IT CUT EVERYBODY WOULD HAVE TO

02:02:46.125 --> 02:02:46.559
MAKE THAT DECISION FOR

02:02:46.625 --> 02:02:47.827
THEMSELVES RIGHT IT CERTAINLY

02:02:47.893 --> 02:02:49.161
EACH COMPANY IF THEY WERE FACED

02:02:49.228 --> 02:02:50.296
WITH THAT.

02:02:50.362 --> 02:02:51.831
THERE WOULD BE A MEETING --

02:02:51.897 --> 02:02:53.766
CONSIDERING THEIR OPTIONS OKAY

02:02:53.833 --> 02:02:55.868
AND AND THEN MAYBE TO THE AUTHOR

02:02:55.935 --> 02:02:58.003
ASSUMING THAT WERE THE CASE AND

02:02:58.070 --> 02:02:59.438
CHANNEL SAID WE'RE NOT GOING.

02:02:59.505 --> 02:03:01.006
TO ALLOW OUR PRODUCT TO BE SOLD

02:03:01.073 --> 02:03:01.707
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

02:03:01.774 --> 02:03:03.142
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT COULD REVEAL

02:03:03.209 --> 02:03:03.776
OUR FORMULAS FOR THOSE

02:03:03.843 --> 02:03:07.079
FRAGRANCES -- WHAT'S TO STOP A

02:03:07.146 --> 02:03:09.682
ONLINE COMPANY FROM BRING THOSE --

02:03:09.749 --> 02:03:11.617
IN THE DON'T HAVE A WAREHOUSE IN

02:03:11.684 --> 02:03:13.319
CALIFORNIA BUT CAN THEY CAN THEY

02:03:13.385 --> 02:03:14.587
CAN SELL ONLINE JUST WITH YOUR

02:03:14.653 --> 02:03:15.821
BILL EFFECTUATE ANYTHING THAT'S

02:03:15.888 --> 02:03:18.791
BROUGHT IN THROUGH.

02:03:18.858 --> 02:03:20.826
A SHIPPING APPARATUS.

02:03:20.893 --> 02:03:21.560
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD US

02:03:21.627 --> 02:03:22.394
SENATOR STONE AND YOU KNOW THIS

02:03:22.461 --> 02:03:23.929
ISN'T ABOUT A COMPANY TELLING US

02:03:23.996 --> 02:03:26.098
WHAT THEIR FORMULA IS BECAUSE

02:03:26.165 --> 02:03:28.167
THE WAY YOU MIX INGREDIENTS

02:03:28.234 --> 02:03:29.602
THAT'S HOW YOU GET A CERTAIN

02:03:29.668 --> 02:03:31.904
SMELL OR A CERTAIN FLAVOR.

02:03:31.971 --> 02:03:34.507
ALL THIS BILL IS ASKING BE DONE

02:03:34.573 --> 02:03:36.609
IS THAT THESE THESE INGREDIENTS

02:03:36.675 --> 02:03:38.310
THAT COULD BE WELL IN THE

02:03:38.377 --> 02:03:39.879
INGREDIENT IS LISTED WE'RE NOT

02:03:39.945 --> 02:03:41.647
TELLING HOW YOU MIX IT WHAT

02:03:41.714 --> 02:03:42.815
HAPPENS WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER.

02:03:42.882 --> 02:03:43.749
SO I THINK THERE'S A LITTLE

02:03:43.816 --> 02:03:45.284
SUBTLE DIFFERENCE THERE IN

02:03:45.351 --> 02:03:46.619
LISTING THE INGREDIENTS AND

02:03:46.685 --> 02:03:48.020
ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT WHAT THE

02:03:48.087 --> 02:03:50.923
FORMULA IS TO MAKE THE PRODUCT --

02:03:50.990 --> 02:03:51.557
I THINK IT'S SUBTLE BUT I THINK

02:03:51.624 --> 02:03:53.325
IT'S THEREBUT NO THE BILL DOES

02:03:53.392 --> 02:03:55.561
NOT DO ANYTHING -- WITH --

02:03:55.628 --> 02:03:56.762
THINGS BEING SHIPPED IN IF I

HE'S BEEN HOSPITALIZED FIVE

02:13:07.813 --> 02:13:10.449

ALLOW HIM TO KNOW.

02:13:27.432 --> 02:13:29.334

ME HE DOESN'T MEET CRITERIA.

02:14:29.060 --> 02:14:31.163
THEY BASE MOST OF THAT ON THE

02:16:40.091 --> 02:16:41.660
AND THEY SAID THINGS LIKE IF

02:16:41.726 --> 02:16:43.795
THAN INDIVIDUALS UNABLE TO PER --

02:16:43.862 --> 02:16:45.630
ADEQUATELY CONSUME FOOD AND

02:16:45.697 --> 02:16:47.532
WATER WHILE ON THE UNIT MEANING

02:16:47.599 --> 02:16:49.234
IN THE HOSPITAL THEY DIDN'T MEET

02:16:49.301 --> 02:16:52.671
CRITERIA I ARGUED THAT DOESN'T.

02:16:52.737 --> 02:16:55.907
TALK TO THE ISSUE OF PROVIDING

02:16:55.974 --> 02:16:57.442
FOR ONE'S OWN.

02:16:57.509 --> 02:16:59.644
APPARENTLY STEALING FOOD WHICH

02:16:59.711 --> 02:17:01.379
MY SON FREQUENTLY DID OR DIGGING

02:17:01.446 --> 02:17:02.480
IT OUT OF A DUMPSTER IS

02:17:02.547 --> 02:17:03.815
ACCEPTABLE.

02:17:03.882 --> 02:17:05.784
THE MENTION TO THE PUBLIC NUDITY

02:17:05.850 --> 02:17:08.019
OR INADVERTENT EXHIBITIONISM

02:17:08.086 --> 02:17:09.955
WOULD BECAUSE OF A DEFINING FOR

02:17:10.021 --> 02:17:12.090
GRAVELY DISABLED.

02:17:12.157 --> 02:17:13.291
BUT WEARING RIPPED CLOTHES

02:17:13.358 --> 02:17:16.294
CLOTHING SOAKED IN URINE IS OKAY --

02:17:16.361 --> 02:17:18.029
THEY SAID THAT OF FOR PERSON IS

02:17:18.096 --> 02:17:19.564
UNABLE TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE

02:17:19.631 --> 02:17:21.066
SHELTER IN THE COMMUNITY DUE TO

02:17:21.132 --> 02:17:22.467
BEHAVIORS AND SYMPTOMS OF A

02:17:22.534 --> 02:17:24.202
MENTAL ILLNESS THEY WOULD THEN

02:17:24.269 --> 02:17:24.603
MEET.

02:17:24.669 --> 02:17:27.505
THE CRITERIA BUT LIVING IN A

02:17:27.572 --> 02:17:29.641
CARDBOARD BOXES OKAY.

02:17:29.708 --> 02:17:30.475
I WASN'T SURE WHAT TO DO.

02:17:30.542 --> 02:17:31.810
I KNOW THAT THIS WAS NOT THE

02:17:31.876 --> 02:17:33.912
INTENTION OF THE LAW SO I TURNED

02:17:33.979 --> 02:17:35.313
TO MY LEGISLATOR OF MY A

02:17:35.380 --> 02:17:38.483
LEGISLATOR -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

02:17:38.550 --> 02:17:41.920
TEN AND TWO YEARS AGO HAS THEN

02:17:41.987 --> 02:17:43.088
ALLEGE DIRECTOR.

02:17:43.154 --> 02:17:44.990
BORROWED A BILL SUBMITTED IT WE

02:17:45.056 --> 02:17:46.691
FELT HE GOT IT WRONG HE SIMPLY

02:17:46.758 --> 02:17:48.827
ADDED THE WORDS MEDICAL CARE

02:17:48.893 --> 02:17:50.295
AFTER FOOD CLOTHING AND SHELTER

02:17:50.362 --> 02:17:51.663
AND DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE MUCH

02:17:51.730 --> 02:17:53.064
ELSE TO THE DEFINITION.

02:17:53.131 --> 02:17:54.799
WE FELT IT WAS WRONG AND

02:17:54.866 --> 02:17:56.067
ASSEMBLY MEMBER TENDED NOT

02:17:56.134 --> 02:17:58.370
PERCENT BILL FORWARD BUT IT DID

02:17:58.436 --> 02:17:59.771
GET THE ATTENTION OF LA COUNTY.

02:17:59.838 --> 02:18:02.140
AND LAST YEAR LA COUNTY THEN --

02:18:02.207 --> 02:18:03.608
WORKED WITH FAMILY MEMBERS

02:18:03.675 --> 02:18:06.544
SANTIAGO AND WE DEVELOPED AB

02:18:06.611 --> 02:18:07.112
NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE IF YOU

02:18:07.178 --> 02:18:08.046
REMEMBER I WAS HERE LAST YEAR IN

02:18:08.113 --> 02:18:12.550
SUPPORT OF AB -- NINETEEN

02:18:12.617 --> 02:18:13.184
SEVENTY ONE THAT FAILED BECAUSE

02:18:13.251 --> 02:18:13.985
EVERYONE GOT REALLY HYPER

02:18:14.052 --> 02:18:15.353
FOCUSED ON WHAT IS THE

02:18:15.420 --> 02:18:17.122
DEFINITION OF MEDICAL CARE.

02:18:17.188 --> 02:18:18.390
AND THEY DETERMINED THAT AN

02:18:18.456 --> 02:18:20.125
INDIVIDUAL HAD TO BE WITHIN SIX

02:18:20.191 --> 02:18:21.459
MONTHS OF DIE OFF BEFORE THEY

02:18:21.526 --> 02:18:23.161
WOULD REACH OUT AND HELP THEM OR

02:18:23.228 --> 02:18:25.363
FIND AN ELIGIBLE UNDER THIS LAW.

02:18:25.430 --> 02:18:27.165
SO THE BILL DIED THEN -- WE

02:18:27.232 --> 02:18:29.934
FORGOT AT THAT POINT TO DEFINE

02:18:30.001 --> 02:18:30.468
WHAT IS FOOD CLOTHING AND

02:18:30.535 --> 02:18:31.836
SHELTER.

02:18:31.903 --> 02:18:32.837
SO.

02:18:32.904 --> 02:18:34.472
IN MY OPINION I WANT TO SHARE

02:18:34.539 --> 02:18:36.541
WHY I THINK THAT SB SIX FORTY IS

02:18:36.608 --> 02:18:40.412
AN IMPROVEMENT OVER AB --

02:18:40.478 --> 02:18:40.912
NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE FOR

02:18:40.979 --> 02:18:41.546
STARTERS ADDING ANOTHER

02:18:41.613 --> 02:18:43.248

CAPACITY TO MAKE A DECISION.

02:19:04.736 --> 02:19:06.504
IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE LAW IT

02:19:06.571 --> 02:19:08.640

RIGHTS CALIFORNIA -- WE ARE

02:20:47.705 --> 02:20:49.307
OPPOSED TO THIS BILL -- FOR MANY

02:20:49.374 --> 02:20:51.109
OF THE SAME REASONS WE'VE BEEN

02:20:51.176 --> 02:20:53.278
OPPOSED AND AND VARIOUS EFFORTS

02:20:53.344 --> 02:20:55.480
THAT HAVE ATTEMPTED TO EXPAND

02:20:55.547 --> 02:20:57.315
CONSERVATORSHIP WITHOUT ASSURING

02:20:57.382 --> 02:20:58.850
THAT THERE ARE SERVICES AND

02:20:58.917 --> 02:21:01.553
SUPPORT OF HOUSING TECH COMPANY --

02:21:01.619 --> 02:21:03.888
THOSE EXPANDED CONSERVATORSHIP.

02:21:03.955 --> 02:21:06.791
THIS BILL WAS REALLY I THINK IS

02:21:06.858 --> 02:21:10.028
PREMISED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT

02:21:10.094 --> 02:21:11.930
THE CURRENT DEFINITION OF

02:21:11.996 --> 02:21:14.666
GRAVELY DISABLED LACKS CLARITY.

02:21:14.732 --> 02:21:17.068
BUT BUT WHAT IT DOES IS

02:21:17.135 --> 02:21:19.671
SUBSTITUTES A NUMBER OF TERMS --

02:21:19.737 --> 02:21:22.073
IN THERE WITHIN THE DEFINITION

02:21:22.140 --> 02:21:27.645
OF GRAVELY DISABLED -- THAT I

02:21:27.712 --> 02:21:29.113
THINK ARE.

02:21:29.180 --> 02:21:29.914
ACTUALLY OVERLY BROAD AND MORE

02:21:29.981 --> 02:21:31.916
CONFUSING TO THOSE WHO ON THE

02:21:31.983 --> 02:21:33.518
STREET WHO WOULD BE LOOKING AT

02:21:33.585 --> 02:21:34.686
ATTEMPTING TO APPLY THE

02:21:34.752 --> 02:21:37.989
DEFINITION OF GRAVELY DISABLED.

02:21:38.056 --> 02:21:40.592
SO YOU HAVE -- A NUMBER IN TERMS

02:21:40.658 --> 02:21:42.327
IN THERE FOR EXAMPLE IN CAPABLE

02:21:42.393 --> 02:21:45.363
OF MAKING INFORMED DECISIONS --

02:21:45.430 --> 02:21:46.798
SIGNIFICANT PSYCHIATRIC

02:21:46.865 --> 02:21:49.367
DEGRADATION -- EVEN ONE THAT'S

02:21:49.434 --> 02:21:51.102
MISMANAGEMENT OF HIS OR HER

02:21:51.169 --> 02:21:53.204
ESSENTIAL NEEDS THE COULD RESULT

02:21:53.271 --> 02:21:55.874
IN BODILY HARM -- ALL I THINK

02:21:55.940 --> 02:21:57.809
WHICH ARE OVERLY BROAD THIS IS A

02:21:57.876 --> 02:21:59.277
DEFINITION THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT

02:21:59.344 --> 02:22:01.212
IN FROM ANOTHER STATE THE

02:22:01.279 --> 02:22:02.780
IMPORTANT POINT I THINK IS.

02:22:02.847 --> 02:22:04.616
IT WITHIN LPS IN THE STATE OF

02:22:04.682 --> 02:22:07.418
CALIFORNIA THAT'S A DECADES OLD --

02:22:07.485 --> 02:22:09.454
STATUTE WE'VE DEALT WITH THE

02:22:09.520 --> 02:22:12.156
DEFINITION OF GRAVELY DISABLED

02:22:12.223 --> 02:22:13.625
FOR MANY MANY YEARS IT'S BEEN

02:22:13.691 --> 02:22:15.593
INTERPRETED BY THE COURTS OVER

02:22:15.660 --> 02:22:17.595
AND OVER IT'S INTERPRETED BY --

02:22:17.662 --> 02:22:19.530
LAW ENFORCEMENT AND SIMPLY

02:22:19.597 --> 02:22:21.466
SUBSTITUTING ANOTHER DEFINITION

02:22:21.532 --> 02:22:23.935
ANOTHER SET OF WORDS DOESN'T DO

02:22:24.002 --> 02:22:26.404
WHAT I THINK -- THE THE

02:22:26.471 --> 02:22:27.639
PROPONENTS OF THE BILL WOULD

02:22:27.705 --> 02:22:30.909
HOPE THAT IT WOULD WOULD DO --

02:22:30.975 --> 02:22:32.777
SO WE WOULD SGGEST.

02:22:32.844 --> 02:22:35.847
THAT IN ADDITION TO THAT THE LPS

02:22:35.914 --> 02:22:38.349
IS REALLY A COMPLEX BALLOTS IT'S

02:22:38.416 --> 02:22:40.551
A COMPLEX BALANCE TO INSURE THAT

02:22:40.618 --> 02:22:43.588
WE'RE PROTECTING INDIVIDUALS --

02:22:43.655 --> 02:22:45.390
FROM DANGER TO THEMSELVES IN

02:22:45.456 --> 02:22:49.060
DANGER TO OTHERS WHILE-RESPECTING THE AUTONOMY AND

02:22:49.127 --> 02:22:51.896
RIGHTS OF OF INDIVIDUALS NOT TO

02:22:51.963 --> 02:22:54.666
BE HELD AGAINST -- AGAINST THEIR

02:22:54.732 --> 02:22:57.001
WILL AND IT'S IT'S NEARLY

02:22:57.068 --> 02:22:59.504
IMPOSSIBLE TO LOOK AT JUST ONE

02:22:59.570 --> 02:23:01.406
LITTLE PIECE OF LPS WITHOUT

02:23:01.472 --> 02:23:03.741
UNDERSTANDING THE ENTIRE BREADTH

02:23:03.808 --> 02:23:04.742
OF THIS STATUTE.

02:23:04.809 --> 02:23:06.511
AND THE BALANCE THAT IT HAS TO

02:23:06.577 --> 02:23:08.413
MAKE IN PROTECTING RIGHTS

02:23:08.479 --> 02:23:13.318
AGAINST PROTECTING --

02:23:13.384 --> 02:23:15.553
INDIVIDUALS.

02:23:15.620 --> 02:23:15.987
SO FOR THAT REASON.

02:23:16.054 --> 02:23:18.089
MISTER CHAIR WE ARE OPPOSED TO

02:23:18.156 --> 02:23:19.490

THAT DISABILITY RIGHTS

02:23:26.397 --> 02:23:28.466
CALIFORNIA IS AND IN ADDITION WE

02:23:28.533 --> 02:23:29.968
ALSO BELIEVE THAT.

02:23:30.034 --> 02:23:31.536
A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE

02:23:31.602 --> 02:23:32.870
SEEN WITH CONSERVATORSHIP SIR

02:23:32.937 --> 02:23:34.772

02:23:34.839 --> 02:23:35.940
SERVICES THAT NEED TO BE

02:23:36.007 --> 02:23:37.742

CENTER MITCHELL.

02:24:39.570 --> 02:24:41.472
IS THE HEAD A MORE LOT I WAS IN

02:24:41.539 --> 02:24:44.342
COMMITTEE OUT LAST YEAR WHEN WE

02:24:44.409 --> 02:24:46.110
DEBATED AND AGREED ON SOME

02:24:46.177 --> 02:24:50.915
AMENDMENTS ON AB NINETEEN

02:24:50.982 --> 02:24:51.749
SEVENTY ONE THERE WAS AN

02:24:51.816 --> 02:24:53.818
EXPECTATION THAT THAT LOOKS AND

02:24:53.885 --> 02:24:56.287
CONTINUED WORK WOULD BE DONE --

02:24:56.354 --> 02:24:57.755
I UNDERSTAND THAT BILL WAS NOT

02:24:57.822 --> 02:24:59.657
AMENDED IN THE ADDITIONAL

02:24:59.724 --> 02:25:00.558
COMMITTEES IT WAS HEARD IN AND

02:25:00.625 --> 02:25:01.859
THEN IT.

02:25:01.926 --> 02:25:05.763
IT DIED IN AN ACTIVE FILE -- YOU

02:25:05.830 --> 02:25:07.198
KNOW I I WOULD JUST HAVE TO SAY

02:25:07.265 --> 02:25:09.233
THAT THAT I HAVE TO WITH WITH

02:25:09.300 --> 02:25:10.868
ALL DUE RESPECT DISAGREE WITH

02:25:10.935 --> 02:25:12.103
ONE COMMENT YOU MAY.

02:25:12.170 --> 02:25:13.504
AND THAT'S THE NOTION THAT

02:25:13.571 --> 02:25:15.306
LANCEMENT PATRICK SHORT ACT IS

02:25:15.373 --> 02:25:16.340
BROKEN.

02:25:16.407 --> 02:25:19.243
AND I THINK THAT THAT WHILE WE

02:25:19.310 --> 02:25:25.483
DO HAVE A OVERWHELMING -- ISSUE

02:25:25.550 --> 02:25:26.784
IMPACTING ALL OF US ACROSS THE

02:25:26.851 --> 02:25:28.319
STATE.

02:25:28.386 --> 02:25:30.988
ON INTO REPRESENTED BY.

02:25:31.055 --> 02:25:33.191
THE TWO WOMEN HERE WHO TALK

02:25:33.257 --> 02:25:34.692
ABOUT THEIR OWN FAMILY MEMBERS.

02:25:34.759 --> 02:25:37.161
BUT TO DENY THE SIGNIFICANCE OF

02:25:37.228 --> 02:25:39.197
THAT ACTED AS FIFTY PLUS YEAR

02:25:39.263 --> 02:25:41.666
NOW HISTORY RECOGNIZING THE

02:25:41.732 --> 02:25:43.734
CULTURE WITHIN WHICH IT WAS

02:25:43.801 --> 02:25:45.503
ESTABLISHED AND HOW FAR WE'VE

02:25:45.570 --> 02:25:46.370
COME.

02:25:46.437 --> 02:25:48.172
I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR TO

02:25:48.239 --> 02:25:50.041
CAN SAY THAT IT'S BROKEN --

02:25:50.108 --> 02:25:51.175
SHOULD IT.

02:25:51.242 --> 02:25:54.846
REQUIRE -- AID A NEW LOOK.

02:25:54.912 --> 02:25:57.215
PERHAPS -- I THINK I AM

02:25:57.281 --> 02:25:59.550
CONCERNED ABOUT A PIECEMEAL

02:25:59.617 --> 02:26:04.589
APPROACH. TO RE OPENING -- AT

02:26:04.655 --> 02:26:06.958
ISSUE IS SENSITIVE AS HOW WE

02:26:07.024 --> 02:26:09.360
ALLOW -- FOR THE PROTECTION OF

02:26:09.427 --> 02:26:10.795
INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS FOR THOSE WITH

02:26:10.862 --> 02:26:12.163
SEVERE DISABILITIES AVAIL

02:26:12.230 --> 02:26:14.031
ILLNESS I WOULD ALSO CHALLENGE

02:26:14.098 --> 02:26:16.033
THE OPPOSITION AS I DID LAST

02:26:16.100 --> 02:26:19.670
YEAR -- THAT WE CAN'T DIGGER

02:26:19.737 --> 02:26:22.640
HILLS IN THE SAND -- BASED ON

02:26:22.707 --> 02:26:24.375
THAT FIFTY YEAR AGO HISTORY AND

02:26:24.442 --> 02:26:26.410
MAKE AN ASSUMPTION THAT ANY

02:26:26.477 --> 02:26:27.879
CONVERSATION ABOUT.

02:26:27.945 --> 02:26:29.480
ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ACT'S MEANS

02:26:29.547 --> 02:26:31.082
THAT WE OPEN THE FLOOD DOORS AND

02:26:31.149 --> 02:26:33.351
WE TRAVEL BACK IN TIME I DON'T

02:26:33.417 --> 02:26:34.752
BELIEVE WE'RE THERE EITHER.

02:26:34.819 --> 02:26:36.888
BUT THE YEARS I'VE SPENT ON SUB

02:26:36.954 --> 02:26:38.856
ONE IN SUB -- THREE IN DEALING

02:26:38.923 --> 02:26:41.993
WITH -- FROM A FINANCE

02:26:42.059 --> 02:26:44.095
PERSPECTIVE WAYS IN WHICH WE

02:26:44.162 --> 02:26:46.764
SUPPORT -- THE SEVERELY DISABLED

02:26:46.831 --> 02:26:47.698
AND THOSE SUFFERING FROM MENTAL

02:26:47.765 --> 02:26:50.401
ILLNESS THROUGH THE LANCEMENT

02:26:50.468 --> 02:26:51.402
PICTURE SHORT ACT YOU KNOW

02:26:51.469 --> 02:26:52.803
SUGGESTS TO ME THAT THAT MY

02:26:52.870 --> 02:26:56.073
PREFERENCE WOULD BE AS YOU SAID.

02:26:56.140 --> 02:26:57.341
BECAUSE THE DEALER AUDIT HAS

02:26:57.408 --> 02:27:01.045
BEEN COMMISSIONED.

02:27:01.112 --> 02:27:03.014
THAT WE WAIT AND SEE.

02:27:03.080 --> 02:27:04.882
I WANT TO BE VERY CURIOUS TO SEE

02:27:04.949 --> 02:27:05.583
WHAT THE AUDIT AND FALLS IF IT

02:27:05.650 --> 02:27:07.351
PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US

02:27:07.418 --> 02:27:10.154
TO LOOK MORE BROADLY AT THE ACT --

02:27:10.221 --> 02:27:11.722
BRINGING ALL OF THE VESTED

02:27:11.789 --> 02:27:13.591
INTERESTS TO THE TABLE AND

02:27:13.658 --> 02:27:16.294
HAVING A FAIR TWENTY NINETEEN

02:27:16.360 --> 02:27:17.695
RELEVANT CONVERSATION.

02:27:17.762 --> 02:27:19.463
NOT TO SUGGEST THAT WE OPEN THE

02:27:19.530 --> 02:27:20.998
FLOODGATES TO TRAVEL BACK IN

02:27:21.065 --> 02:27:23.134
TIME BUT ALSO TO ACKNOWLEDGE

02:27:23.201 --> 02:27:24.535
VERY REAL ISSUES WE ARE

02:27:24.602 --> 02:27:25.703
CONFRONTING.

02:27:25.770 --> 02:27:28.606

02:27:34.111 --> 02:27:35.046

I DO JUST WANT IT -- SAY TO THE

PHYSICIAN WHO TAKES CARE OF

02:32:19.964 --> 02:32:21.665
CHILDREN WHO HAVE BEHAVIORAL

02:32:21.732 --> 02:32:24.568
ISSUES -- NETWORKS PARENTS WHO

02:32:24.635 --> 02:32:26.871
FACED -- SOME THE SAME STORIES

02:32:26.937 --> 02:32:29.006
AND I THINK THAT ON ONE LEVEL

02:32:29.073 --> 02:32:30.674
YES WE NEED MORE SUPPORT

02:32:30.741 --> 02:32:32.676
SERVICES YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT

02:32:32.743 --> 02:32:33.444
CONSUMERS AND THE CONSERVATIVES

02:32:33.511 --> 02:32:35.379
IN A HOUSING ETCETERA -- BUT

02:32:35.446 --> 02:32:37.748
EVEN BEYOND THAT AND I KNOW WE

02:32:37.815 --> 02:32:39.350
HAVE TO STRIKE A VERY CAREFUL

02:32:39.416 --> 02:32:42.152
BALANCE -- THAT EVEN SOMETIMES

02:32:42.219 --> 02:32:44.655
WHEN THE SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE

02:32:44.722 --> 02:32:49.393
IF THE PERSON ISN'T WILLING TO

02:32:49.460 --> 02:32:50.528
PARTAKE OF IT.

02:32:50.594 --> 02:32:51.529
WHAT WE DO AND AGAIN WE WANT TO

02:32:51.595 --> 02:32:52.596
RESPECT AND WE'RE NOT TALKING

02:32:52.663 --> 02:32:53.197
ABOUT WE DON'T TAKE PEOPLE'S

02:32:53.264 --> 02:32:55.065
ECONOMY AWAY?

02:32:55.132 --> 02:32:55.332
YOU KNOW.

02:32:55.399 --> 02:32:56.967
UP IN SOME SENSES WHAT HAPPENS

02:32:57.034 --> 02:32:58.335
TO YOUR THàNH E. WHEN YOU'RE

02:32:58.402 --> 02:33:00.905
DISEASE DOESN'T REALLY ALLOW YOU

02:33:00.971 --> 02:33:02.206
TO SELECTIVELY EXERCISES THAT

02:33:02.273 --> 02:33:04.041
INTEL'S YOU'RE TREATED THAT YOU

02:33:04.108 --> 02:33:06.176
CAN ACTUALLY EXERCISE AUTONOMY

02:33:06.243 --> 02:33:06.577
RIGHT.

02:33:06.644 --> 02:33:08.479
AND WE ARE WITH THE VERY CAREFUL

02:33:08.546 --> 02:33:09.346
HOW YOU DO THAT'S I'M VERY

02:33:09.413 --> 02:33:10.414
SENSITIVE THAT SO AND I THINK

02:33:10.481 --> 02:33:12.016
THAT WHAT'S IN THE BILL

02:33:12.082 --> 02:33:14.084
CURRENTLY IS TOO BROAD OKAY BUT

02:33:14.151 --> 02:33:15.152
I THINK THERE'S SOME WORK THAT

02:33:15.219 --> 02:33:17.221
COULD BE DONE AND IT DOES NEED

02:33:17.288 --> 02:33:18.789
TO ALSO LOOP BACK INTO.

02:33:18.856 --> 02:33:21.725
MORE RESOURCES RIGHT AND DIE SIR

02:33:21.792 --> 02:33:23.394
SHARE CENTER MITCHELL'S

02:33:23.460 --> 02:33:25.329
EXPERIENCE BECAUSE I'VE.

02:33:25.396 --> 02:33:27.431
SUCCEEDED HER ON BUDGETS OF

02:33:27.498 --> 02:33:28.332
THREE AND YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT

02:33:28.399 --> 02:33:30.734
NOW WHAT KIND OF RESOURCES AND

02:33:30.801 --> 02:33:31.835
SO FOR THAT OUR BUDGET SO FORTH.

02:33:31.902 --> 02:33:36.106
BUT BY SO WE DO NEED TO TACKLE

02:33:36.173 --> 02:33:37.341
THAT.

02:33:37.408 --> 02:33:37.942
BUT I ALSO THINK THERE IS AN

02:33:38.008 --> 02:33:39.109
ELEMENT AS WELL THAT WE NEED TO

02:33:39.176 --> 02:33:40.077
LOOK AT FIGURE OUT DO WE MAKE

02:33:40.144 --> 02:33:41.745
SOME ADJUSTMENTS -- TO TO TO BE

02:33:41.812 --> 02:33:43.180
SURE THAT WE STILL PROTECT WE

02:33:43.247 --> 02:33:45.449
NEED TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS.

02:33:45.516 --> 02:33:48.252
RIGHT THAT'S AND BUT TO ENSURE

02:33:48.319 --> 02:33:49.720
THAT THEY HAVE THOSE RIGHTS AND

02:33:49.787 --> 02:33:51.188
AT A TIME TO ME.

02:33:51.255 --> 02:33:52.923
YOU NEED TO DATE THEY NEED TO BE

02:33:52.990 --> 02:33:54.825
IN A PLACE WHERE.

02:33:54.892 --> 02:33:55.693
THEY HAVE THE JUDGMENT DAY

02:33:55.759 --> 02:33:56.760
THEY'RE ABLE TO DO THAT THAT

02:33:56.827 --> 02:33:57.995
THAT MENTAL ILLNESS IS NOT

02:33:58.062 --> 02:33:59.063
PREVENT THEM FROM DOING THAT AND

02:33:59.129 --> 02:33:59.897
I THINK THAT'S WHY I'M HEARING

02:33:59.964 --> 02:34:01.265
FROM THE PROPONENTS THAT THERE'S

02:34:01.332 --> 02:34:02.633
FRUSTRATION ABOUT.

02:34:02.700 --> 02:34:04.234
AND THAT'S WHAT I'VE HEARD

02:34:04.301 --> 02:34:05.970
PREVIOUSLY NO THAT'S WHAT WE

02:34:06.036 --> 02:34:06.737
HAVE LARA'S LAW AND PEOPLE

02:34:06.804 --> 02:34:07.671
DIFFERENT OPINIONS ABOUT THAT

02:34:07.738 --> 02:34:09.607
OTHER TYPES OF THINGS.

02:34:09.673 --> 02:34:10.941
SO I'M HOPING SIR MOORLACH --

02:34:11.008 --> 02:34:12.476
AND YOU COULD YOU TELL ME WHAT

02:34:12.543 --> 02:34:15.212
YOUR DECISION IS TODAY -- THAT

02:34:15.279 --> 02:34:16.847
CERTAINLY.

02:34:16.914 --> 02:34:17.915

AUDIT WE ALSO WANT TO SEE IF WE

02:34:21.585 --> 02:34:23.087
CAN TRY.

02:34:23.153 --> 02:34:24.021
TO GIVEN TOGETHER AND SEE

02:34:24.088 --> 02:34:24.521
WHETHER WE CAN HAVE THAT

02:34:24.588 --> 02:34:26.890
CONVERSATION BUT HOW WE SOLVE.

02:34:26.957 --> 02:34:27.491
THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE THAT I

02:34:27.558 --> 02:34:29.093

CAN WE FIGURE OUT HOW TO LAND

02:34:41.372 --> 02:34:43.941

02:34:44.008 --> 02:34:45.309
AND AND AND SLIGHTLY.

02:34:45.376 --> 02:34:47.277
HOPEFULLY BETTER PLACE PEOPLE

THEMSELVES WITH VERY LITTLE TIME

02:51:11.461 --> 02:51:13.496
IF THE OTHER. TWO PEOPLE AHEAD

02:51:13.563 --> 02:51:15.398
DON'T KEEP THAT IN MIND SO --

02:51:15.465 --> 02:51:17.567
WELCOME AND LOOK FOR YOUR

02:51:17.634 --> 02:51:19.102
TESTIMONY.

02:51:19.168 --> 02:51:20.837
ACTUALLY YOU CAN JUST YEAH YOU

02:51:20.903 --> 02:51:22.872
HAVE THE MICROPHONE IN FRONT OF

02:51:22.939 --> 02:51:25.408
FIVE YOU THERE OKAY THANK YOU.

02:51:25.475 --> 02:51:25.608
YEAH.

02:51:25.675 --> 02:51:27.977
OKAY.

02:51:28.044 --> 02:51:30.279
I'M OVER HER TEACHER.

02:51:30.346 --> 02:51:30.680
TO PREVENT.

02:51:30.747 --> 02:51:31.781
WE KNOW EACH OTHER A PROFESSOR

02:51:31.848 --> 02:51:33.149
IN AT UC DAVIS AND I'M THE

02:51:33.216 --> 02:51:34.550
DIRECTOR OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL

02:51:34.617 --> 02:51:36.185
HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER WHICH IS

02:51:36.252 --> 02:51:37.387
FUNDED BY THE NATIONAL

02:51:37.453 --> 02:51:38.955
INSTITUTES OF HEALTH.

02:51:39.022 --> 02:51:40.723
AND I WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR

02:51:40.790 --> 02:51:41.824
FOR ACTUALLY.

02:51:41.891 --> 02:51:42.825
PRETTY MUCH LAYING OUT THE

02:51:42.892 --> 02:51:46.062
SCIENCE -- AS IT IS AND YOU KNOW

02:51:46.129 --> 02:51:47.563
JUST MAYBE I'LL ADD A FEW POINTS

02:51:47.630 --> 02:51:50.400
HERE ONE IS THAT THE ORGANIC

02:51:50.466 --> 02:51:52.035
PHOSPHATE PESTICIDES ACTUALLY

02:51:52.101 --> 02:51:53.736
THEY WERE ORIGINALLY BEING

02:51:53.803 --> 02:51:56.272
DEVELOPED -- AS NERVE AGENTS --

02:51:56.339 --> 02:51:58.041
THEY WERE NEVER FORTUNATELY EVER

02:51:58.107 --> 02:52:00.176
USE FOR THAT BUT WERE LATER

02:52:00.243 --> 02:52:01.878
ADAPTED THEN TO BE USES

02:52:01.944 --> 02:52:03.479
PESTICIDES AND THEY KILL.

02:52:03.546 --> 02:52:06.049
INSECTS AND SPIDERS BASICALLY

02:52:06.115 --> 02:52:07.950
THAT'S WHAT THEY DO NOW AT VERY

02:52:08.017 --> 02:52:09.919
HIGH LEVELS THEY CAN BE ACUTELY

02:52:09.986 --> 02:52:12.021
TOXIC AND CAN RESULT IN

02:52:12.088 --> 02:52:13.856
CONVULSIONS AND AND EVEN.

02:52:13.923 --> 02:52:15.892
DEATH WHEN A VERY HIGH LEVEL IS

02:52:15.958 --> 02:52:17.593
TAKEN AND AS POLLS WHICH IS

02:52:17.660 --> 02:52:18.928
REALLY POISONOUS.

02:52:18.995 --> 02:52:20.129
BUT WHAT WE'RE REALLY TALKING

02:52:20.196 --> 02:52:22.065
ABOUT TODAY'S THE LOW LEVEL

02:52:22.131 --> 02:52:23.366
EXPOSURES.

02:52:23.433 --> 02:52:25.835
THAT OCCUR THROUGH READING THE

02:52:25.902 --> 02:52:27.437
AIR UP IF YOU LIVE IN AN

02:52:27.503 --> 02:52:29.205
AGRICULTURAL AREA SAY WITHIN A

02:52:29.272 --> 02:52:35.545
MILE OR SO -- WHERE APPLICATIONS

02:52:35.611 --> 02:52:38.581
ARE BEING -- WHERE CLICK HERE

02:52:38.648 --> 02:52:39.282
FOR US IS BEING A AND OTHER

02:52:39.348 --> 02:52:40.316
ORGAN APOSTATES ARE BEING

02:52:40.383 --> 02:52:41.217
APPLIED YOUR BREATHING AIR

02:52:41.284 --> 02:52:41.718
YOU'RE TAKING AND THOSE

02:52:41.784 --> 02:52:42.752
PESTICIDES AND THERE ARE --

02:52:42.819 --> 02:52:44.320
THERE'S VERY STRONG STUDIES

02:52:44.387 --> 02:52:45.621
SHOWING THAT THAT DRIFT

02:52:45.688 --> 02:52:48.858
CORRESPONDS VERY CLOSELY WITH

02:52:48.925 --> 02:52:50.426
THE APPLICATIONS AND BEEN MADE

02:52:50.493 --> 02:52:53.329
BASED ON DEEP YARD -- DATA.

02:52:53.396 --> 02:52:55.098
AND OF COURSE THE OTHER WAY AS

02:52:55.164 --> 02:52:56.933
LAID OUT BY THE SENATOR IS

02:52:56.999 --> 02:52:58.735
THROUGH RESIDUES THERE ON FOOD

02:52:58.801 --> 02:52:59.802
IN THERE ON ON PARTICULARLY

02:52:59.869 --> 02:53:03.072
FRUITS AND VEGETABLES SO THAT

02:53:03.139 --> 02:53:05.374
AFFECTS EVERYBODY -- BY NOW

02:53:05.441 --> 02:53:07.043
THERE ARE OVER THREE DOZEN

02:53:07.110 --> 02:53:08.277
STUDIES.

02:53:08.344 --> 02:53:10.113
THAT HAVE DEMONSTRATED THIS LINK

02:53:10.179 --> 02:53:12.715
BETWEEN PRENATAL EXPOSURE --

02:53:12.782 --> 02:53:14.550
OVERWHELMINGLY HAVE.

02:53:14.617 --> 02:53:18.187
SHOWN THAT THE OUTCOMES OF OF

02:53:18.254 --> 02:53:21.624
LOWER I. Q. AND IMPAIRMENTS IN.

02:53:21.691 --> 02:53:23.960
MEMORY AND LEARNING AS WELL AS

02:53:24.026 --> 02:53:26.362
SYMPTOMS OF AUTISM SPECTRUM

02:53:26.429 --> 02:53:29.665
DISORDER -- OF ATTENTION DEFICIT

02:53:29.732 --> 02:53:31.200
DISORDER.

02:53:31.267 --> 02:53:33.436
ARE -- ASSOCIATED WITH THAT

02:53:33.503 --> 02:53:36.038
PRENATAL EXPOSURE AND THAT THESE

02:53:36.105 --> 02:53:37.473
OUTCOMES OCCUR.

02:53:37.540 --> 02:53:40.176
STARTING SHORTLY AFTER BIRTH AND

02:53:40.243 --> 02:53:42.211
ALL THE WAY INTO ADOLESCENCE --

02:53:42.278 --> 02:53:45.114
THE THIS REFLECTS ALL

02:53:45.181 --> 02:53:47.950
ALTERATIONS IN BRAIN DEVELOPMENT.

02:53:48.017 --> 02:53:49.619
AND IN FACT A CORE PROPOSES THE

02:53:49.685 --> 02:53:51.087
MOST COMMON OF THESE ORGAN OF

02:53:51.154 --> 02:53:52.889
PHOSPHATES BUT NO STUDY HAS

02:53:52.955 --> 02:53:54.624
IDENTIFIED A LEVEL BELOW WHICH

02:53:54.690 --> 02:53:56.626
WE CAN SCAN SO THERE IT SAFE.

02:53:56.692 --> 02:53:57.994
THE VERY LAST POINT I WANT TO

02:53:58.060 --> 02:53:59.228
MAKE IS THAT THERE IS AN

02:53:59.295 --> 02:54:01.664
ABUNDANT ANIMAL EXPERIMENTAL

02:54:01.731 --> 02:54:03.432
LIVE THE LITERATURE -- MUCH OF

02:54:03.499 --> 02:54:05.334
WHICH WAS DONE BACK IN THE

02:54:05.401 --> 02:54:05.902
NINETEEN NINETIES EARLY TWO

02:54:05.968 --> 02:54:09.505
THOUSANDS IT ALSO SHOWED.

02:54:09.572 --> 02:54:10.807
IMPAIRMENTS IN LEARNING AND

02:54:10.873 --> 02:54:13.476
MEMORY AND BEHAVIORS THE SAME

02:54:13.543 --> 02:54:15.678
SYMPTOMS THAT WE SEE IN HUMAN

02:54:15.745 --> 02:54:17.847
BEINGS -- WE SHOULD HAVE

02:54:17.914 --> 02:54:19.182
EXPECTED THAT THAT WOULD HAPPEN

02:54:19.248 --> 02:54:21.818
AND IN FACT THAT'S WHAT THE LAST

02:54:21.884 --> 02:54:22.318
TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS OF

02:54:22.385 --> 02:54:24.320
EPIDEMIOLOGIC RESEARCH HAS NOW

02:54:24.387 --> 02:54:27.023
SHOWN -- SO I THINK THE EVIDENCE

02:54:27.089 --> 02:54:28.558
IS QUITE COMPELLING.

02:54:28.624 --> 02:54:31.761
AND AS SENATORS -- YOU CAN

02:54:31.828 --> 02:54:33.296
REALLY MOVE FORWARD HOW WE

02:54:33.362 --> 02:54:35.998
REGULATE A CHEMICAL POLICY HERE --

02:54:36.065 --> 02:54:37.633
AND REALLY MAKE THE HIGHEST

02:54:37.700 --> 02:54:40.369
PRIORITY THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND

02:54:40.436 --> 02:54:45.341
PROTECTING CHILDREN'S BRAINS

HAS CO SPONSORS OF THE BILL.

02:55:10.099 --> 02:55:11.834
IN TWENTY FIFTEEN U. S. EPA

02:55:11.901 --> 02:55:12.902
CONCLUDED THAT USING CORPORA

02:55:12.969 --> 02:55:14.904
FALSE ON FOOD DOES NOT MEET THE

02:55:14.971 --> 02:55:16.873
FEDERAL SAFETY STANDARD.

02:55:16.939 --> 02:55:17.506
OF REASONABLE CERTAINTY OF NO

02:55:17.573 --> 02:55:18.875
HARM.

02:55:18.941 --> 02:55:20.142
AND THE AGENCY PROPOSED A BAN

02:55:20.209 --> 02:55:21.077
THAT WOULD HAVE ELIMINATED

02:55:21.143 --> 02:55:23.379
NEARLY ALL USES OF THIS

02:55:23.446 --> 02:55:25.081
PESTICIDE ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

02:55:25.147 --> 02:55:26.649
IN.

02:55:26.716 --> 02:55:27.450
TWENTY SIXTEEN USEPA SCIENTISTS

02:55:27.516 --> 02:55:29.385
REVIEWED THE STUDY CITED BY THE

02:55:29.452 --> 02:55:31.053
OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL AND

02:55:31.120 --> 02:55:32.788
EXAMINE THE HUNDREDS OF WAYS THE

02:55:32.855 --> 02:55:34.891
CORPORATE COST MAY BE USED UNDER

02:55:34.957 --> 02:55:36.392
CURRENT LAW.

02:55:36.459 --> 02:55:36.993
THEY FOUND THAT ALL OF THESE

02:55:37.059 --> 02:55:37.727
USES.

02:55:37.793 --> 02:55:39.228
RESULT IN UNSAFE LEVELS OF

02:55:39.295 --> 02:55:40.396
EXPOSURE.

02:55:40.463 --> 02:55:42.064
WHEN HANDLERS FOLLOW ALL OF THE

02:55:42.131 --> 02:55:43.866

02:55:47.136 --> 02:55:47.904
THEY ALSO FOUND THAT THE

02:55:47.970 --> 02:55:49.472
CONTINUED USE OF CORPORATE FALLS

02:55:49.538 --> 02:55:50.973
ON FOOD HARM TO THOSE WHO EAT

02:55:51.040 --> 02:55:52.241
THE FOOD.

02:55:52.308 --> 02:55:53.976
USES ON FOOD EXPOSE CHILDREN ONE

02:55:54.043 --> 02:55:55.845
TO TWO YEARS OF AGE TO ONE

02:55:55.912 --> 02:55:57.446
HUNDRED FORTY TIMES WHAT US EPA

02:55:57.513 --> 02:55:58.714
CONSIDERS ACCEPTABLE.

02:55:58.781 --> 02:56:00.249
MOREOVER THE AGENCY CONCLUDED

02:56:00.316 --> 02:56:02.018
THERE IS NO SAFE LEVEL OF

02:56:02.084 --> 02:56:04.520
QUICKER ACOSTA DRINKING WATER.

02:56:04.587 --> 02:56:05.721

CONCLUSIONS REACHED BY ITS OWN

02:56:33.149 --> 02:56:34.850

WAS STILL UNDER THE OBAMA

03:03:57.626 --> 03:03:58.360
ADMINISTRATION.

03:03:58.427 --> 03:03:59.628
THE THING ABOUT CALIFORNIA

03:03:59.695 --> 03:04:01.363
THOUGH HE IS EVEN NO MATTER WHAT

03:04:01.430 --> 03:04:02.097
HAPPENS IN THE FEDERAL

03:04:02.164 --> 03:04:03.866
GOVERNMENT WE IN CALIFORNIA IS

03:04:03.932 --> 03:04:05.567
STILL DO OUR OWN THING WE ARE

03:04:05.634 --> 03:04:06.535
THE ONLY STATE IN THE NATION

03:04:06.602 --> 03:04:07.403
THAT HAS A DEPARTMENT OF

03:04:07.469 --> 03:04:09.605
PESTICIDE REGULATION OR DPR.

03:04:09.671 --> 03:04:12.574
AND BEFORE -- PESTICIDE CAN BE

03:04:12.641 --> 03:04:13.675
REGISTERED HERE IN CALIFORNIA

03:04:13.742 --> 03:04:15.043
CPR HAS TO DO ITS OWN

03:04:15.110 --> 03:04:16.345
INDEPENDENT EVALUATION THAT

03:04:16.412 --> 03:04:17.913
LOOKS AT THE HEALTH EFFECTS OF

03:04:17.980 --> 03:04:19.014
PESTICIDES LOOK AT THE EFFECTS

03:04:19.081 --> 03:04:20.048
ON THE ENVIRONMENT.

03:04:20.115 --> 03:04:21.650
LOOKS AT THE TOXICITY AND

03:04:21.717 --> 03:04:23.185
DETERMINES IF THAT PESTICIDE

03:04:23.252 --> 03:04:24.787
SHOULD BE REGISTERED IF THEY

03:04:24.853 --> 03:04:25.421
DETERMINE IT SHOULD BE

03:04:25.487 --> 03:04:26.688
REGISTERED THEY CAN PLACE

03:04:26.755 --> 03:04:27.790
RESTRICTIONS IN MITIGATION

03:04:27.856 --> 03:04:30.159
MEASURES ON THAT PESTICIDE. TO

03:04:30.225 --> 03:04:32.060
ENSURE THAT HUMAN HEALTH HEALTH

03:04:32.127 --> 03:04:32.661
AND THE ENVIRONMENT ARE BEING

03:04:32.728 --> 03:04:34.830
PROTECTED ONCE IT'S REGISTER

03:04:34.897 --> 03:04:36.198
THERE'S A CAN FOR TEN YOU ALL

03:04:36.265 --> 03:04:37.699
EVALUATION AND DATA COLLECTION.

03:04:37.766 --> 03:04:43.705
BY DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE

03:04:43.772 --> 03:04:44.940
REGULATION.

03:04:45.007 --> 03:04:46.008
IF ANYTHING IN THAT CONTINUAL

03:04:46.074 --> 03:04:47.209
EVALUATION LOOKS LIKE THAT IT

03:04:47.276 --> 03:04:47.843
WOULD HAVE AN UNREASONABLE FACT

03:04:47.910 --> 03:04:48.243
ON HUMAN HEALTH.

03:04:48.310 --> 03:04:49.044
IT AUTOMATICALLY TRIGGERS RE

03:04:49.111 --> 03:04:49.678
EVALUATION TO DETERMINE IF THAT

03:04:49.745 --> 03:04:51.480
PESTICIDE SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE

03:04:51.547 --> 03:04:52.915
REGISTERED HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

03:04:52.981 --> 03:04:54.450
FEELS HAS BEEN IT READ HAS BEEN

03:04:54.516 --> 03:04:55.651
REGISTERED AND STUDIED HERE IN

03:04:55.717 --> 03:04:59.087
CALIFORNIA SINCE -- NINETEEN

03:04:59.154 --> 03:04:59.922
EIGHTY FOUR BUT MOST RECENTLY

03:04:59.988 --> 03:05:01.590
I'M IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN IT

03:05:01.657 --> 03:05:03.258
BECAME A RESTRICTED PESTICIDE

03:05:03.325 --> 03:05:04.760
WHICH MEANS NO HOUSEHOLD USE.

03:05:04.827 --> 03:05:06.829
AND AT THAT IT ALSO HAS TO BE

03:05:06.895 --> 03:05:09.097
APPLIED BY A CERTIFIED PESTICIDE

03:05:09.164 --> 03:05:11.400
APPLICATOR YOU JUST CAN'T BE

03:05:11.467 --> 03:05:12.768
ANYONE IN USE THIS PESTICIDE

03:05:12.835 --> 03:05:14.169
ALSO RIGHT NOW.

03:05:14.236 --> 03:05:15.471
DPR IS WORKING WITH THE

03:05:15.537 --> 03:05:16.839
CALIFORNIA RESOURCES BOARD IN

03:05:16.905 --> 03:05:18.073
OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH

03:05:18.140 --> 03:05:19.975
HAZARD ASSESSMENT. TO RE

03:05:20.042 --> 03:05:21.677
EVALUATE THIS PESTICIDE AND DO

03:05:21.743 --> 03:05:23.412
ADDITIONAL MITIGATION MEASURES

03:05:23.479 --> 03:05:25.647
AND RESTRICTIONS ON IT WE ARE

03:05:25.714 --> 03:05:27.483
ANTICIPATING THAT -- BASED ON

03:05:27.549 --> 03:05:28.684
THEIR TIME LINE IT WILL BE DONE

03:05:28.750 --> 03:05:30.352
WITH THAT RE EVALUATION THIS

03:05:30.419 --> 03:05:30.919
FALL.

03:05:30.986 --> 03:05:32.654
SO DEEP HERE IS DOING ITS OWN

03:05:32.721 --> 03:05:34.122
THING SEPARATE FROM THE FEDERAL

03:05:34.189 --> 03:05:36.124
GOVERNMENT RIGHT NOW -- AS TO

03:05:36.191 --> 03:05:37.392
THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE

03:05:37.459 --> 03:05:38.594
BILL FROM THE COMMITTEE MISTER

03:05:38.660 --> 03:05:39.595
CHAIR WE APPRECIATE THE

03:05:39.661 --> 03:05:41.597
CONVERSATIONS WE HAD AND WE WE

03:05:41.663 --> 03:05:42.998
APPRECIATE ALSO YOUR CONCERN

03:05:43.065 --> 03:05:44.166
WITH CORPORATE FAST AND

03:05:44.233 --> 03:05:45.868
UNDERSTAND WHERE THIS IS COMING

03:05:45.934 --> 03:05:47.369
FROM UNFORTUNATELY WE STILL DO

03:05:47.436 --> 03:05:48.003
HAVE TO STAY OPPOSED WITH THOSE

03:05:48.070 --> 03:05:50.205
AMENDMENTS -- CALIFORNIA HAS

03:05:50.272 --> 03:05:51.974
ACTUALLY BEEN DOING PESTICIDE

03:05:52.040 --> 03:05:53.542
RESIDUE TESTING ON OUR

03:05:53.609 --> 03:05:56.879
AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES SENSE

03:05:56.945 --> 03:05:57.546
NINETEEN TWENTY SIX SO WE'VE

03:05:57.613 --> 03:05:58.647
BEEN DOING THIS IN CALIFORNIA

03:05:58.714 --> 03:05:59.548
FOR A LONG TIME.

03:05:59.615 --> 03:06:01.717
THAT HAS BECOME THE MOST ROBUST

03:06:01.783 --> 03:06:04.219
PESTICIDE RESIDUE TESTING IN THE

03:06:04.286 --> 03:06:05.954
ENTIRE NATION -- WHAT DO YOU

03:06:06.021 --> 03:06:08.290
CARE DOES IS IT GOES OUT TO THE

03:06:08.357 --> 03:06:10.092
FIELDS AND IT LOOKS IT COLLECTS

03:06:10.158 --> 03:06:12.327
SAMPLES -- BECAUSE FARMERS

03:06:12.394 --> 03:06:17.232
MARKETS -- PLACES OF DEPOT PORT

03:06:17.299 --> 03:06:18.467
CENTER TO SEE IF A IN CDF.

03:06:18.534 --> 03:06:20.035
FAA TESTS THOSE SUBJECTS FOR

03:06:20.102 --> 03:06:21.637
OVER THREE HUNDRED FIFTY

03:06:21.703 --> 03:06:22.738
PESTICIDES.

03:06:22.804 --> 03:06:24.039
IF THERE IS ANY ILLEGAL

03:06:24.106 --> 03:06:25.941
PESTICIDE RESIDUE ON THERE IT IS

03:06:26.008 --> 03:06:26.542
IMMEDIATELY PULLED FROM THE

03:06:26.608 --> 03:06:28.544
SHELVES SO WE ARE ALSO TESTING

03:06:28.610 --> 03:06:29.845
THIS AND THE SPECIFICALLY LOOK

03:06:29.912 --> 03:06:32.581
AT SAMPLES THAT IMPACT OR THAT

03:06:32.648 --> 03:06:34.383
CHILDREN EAT FOOD THAT CHILDREN

03:06:34.449 --> 03:06:36.051
TEND TO EAT AND ALSO THOSE.

03:06:36.118 --> 03:06:37.653
COMMODITIES THAT MAY USE

03:06:37.719 --> 03:06:40.656
CHEMICALS THAT -- WOULD HAVE

03:06:40.722 --> 03:06:42.724
SOME TOXICITY TO THEM -- SO IN

03:06:42.791 --> 03:06:44.159
CONCLUSION WE WOULD JUST

03:06:44.226 --> 03:06:45.827
REQUESTED THAT THE COMMITTEE

03:06:45.894 --> 03:06:46.428

INSECTICIDES.

03:08:27.229 --> 03:08:29.297
IS THE BEST SCIENTIFIC PRACTICE

03:08:29.364 --> 03:08:31.033
TO COMPARE LIKE FOR LIKE SO WHEN

03:08:31.099 --> 03:08:32.968
YOU'RE LOOKING AT RESULTS PLEASE

SECONDLY IN THE PAST TWENTY

03:08:38.674 --> 03:08:40.208
YEARS IT'S BEEN MENTIONED.

03:08:40.275 --> 03:08:41.443
THAT DPR REGULATION OF

03:08:41.510 --> 03:08:43.512
CHLORPYRIFOS HAS RESULTED IN

03:08:43.578 --> 03:08:46.515
CHANGED USES REDUCE DRIFT AND AS

03:08:46.581 --> 03:08:48.483
A RESULT EXPOSURE POTENTIAL HAS

03:08:48.550 --> 03:08:51.687
DECLINED IN CALIFORNIA. FOR THE

03:08:51.753 --> 03:08:53.355
MOST PART THE STUDIES THAT ARE

03:08:53.422 --> 03:08:54.823
BEING DISCUSSED ARE AND CHILDREN

03:08:54.890 --> 03:08:56.358

TWO THOUSAND THE TO NEW YORK

03:09:00.262 --> 03:09:01.830
CITY STUDIES ARE ABOUT INDOOR

03:09:01.897 --> 03:09:03.598
APPLICATIONS WHICH ARE NO LONGER

03:09:03.665 --> 03:09:05.500
REGISTERED.

03:09:05.567 --> 03:09:07.002
THERE ARE TWO AUTISM STUDIES

03:09:07.069 --> 03:09:09.137
HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT RELIED

03:09:09.204 --> 03:09:11.506
ON PROXIMITY ON AN APPLICATION

03:09:11.573 --> 03:09:12.441
AND RESIDENTS.

03:09:12.507 --> 03:09:15.043
AND THESE RECORDS WERE FROM THE

03:09:15.110 --> 03:09:17.245
NINETEEN NINETIES TO TWO

03:09:17.312 --> 03:09:17.879
THOUSAND TEN AND THAT THIS

ADDRESS WRAP UP UP AND COMING ON

03:09:19.448 --> 03:09:21.016
WE REASSURINGLY THE AUTISM STUDY

03:09:21.083 --> 03:09:22.317
OF CHILDREN BORN.

03:09:22.384 --> 03:09:24.820
AFTERWARDS FOUND NO LINK OF

03:09:26.221 --> 03:09:27.355
FURTHER THE HOME STUDY IN OHIO

03:09:27.422 --> 03:09:28.790
CAN DISPEL THE CONCERNS ABOUT

03:09:28.857 --> 03:09:30.792
RESIDUE SINCE NO ADVERSE

03:09:30.859 --> 03:09:32.928

LET THE REGULATOR TO THE JOB.

03:11:11.259 --> 03:11:13.662
I THINK THIS BILL.

03:11:13.728 --> 03:11:14.729
THANK YOU RIGHT SEEN OTHER

03:11:24.039 --> 03:11:26.775
YOU GO.

03:11:26.842 --> 03:11:27.709
THEY ARE OKAY -- YOU SEEM TO

03:11:27.776 --> 03:11:29.311
HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WITH

03:11:29.377 --> 03:11:31.913
THE CLERK -- FOSS -- CAN YOU

03:11:31.980 --> 03:11:33.114
TALK ABOUT THE ASSERTION ABOUT

03:11:33.181 --> 03:11:34.616
THE CORE PEER FAUCETS FOUND IN

03:11:34.683 --> 03:11:36.384
THE HUMAN BODY.

03:11:36.451 --> 03:11:37.619
WELL THE EVIDENCE FOR THAT

03:11:37.686 --> 03:11:39.921
REALLY COMES FROM THE CDC

03:11:39.988 --> 03:11:41.223
PROGRAM IN WHICH THERE BY

03:11:41.289 --> 03:11:43.024
MANAGED COLLECTING URINE FROM.

03:11:43.091 --> 03:11:44.759
A SAMPLE OF OF INDIVIDUALS

03:11:44.826 --> 03:11:46.394
ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AND

03:11:46.461 --> 03:11:48.697
INDEED WE DO SEE VERY LOW LEVELS

03:11:48.763 --> 03:11:51.533
FAIRLY UBIQUITOUS SEE YOU

03:11:51.600 --> 03:11:51.833
[inaudible]

03:11:51.900 --> 03:11:53.468
ACROSS EVERYBODY.

03:11:53.535 --> 03:11:54.636
BUT THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS TO

03:11:54.703 --> 03:11:56.705
UNDERSTAND ABOUT THAT FIRST OF

03:11:56.771 --> 03:11:58.874
ALL -- THEY'RE MEASURING

03:11:58.940 --> 03:12:00.308
TRICOLOR APPEARED IN ALL AND

03:12:00.375 --> 03:12:01.610
THAT'S REASSURING BECAUSE IT'S

03:12:01.676 --> 03:12:02.744
TELLING US THAT IT'S BREAKING

03:12:02.811 --> 03:12:04.012
DOWN IN THE BODY IT DOESN'T

03:12:04.079 --> 03:12:06.014
PERSIST IT'S IT'S BEING CLEARED

03:12:06.081 --> 03:12:07.115
RAPIDLY.

03:12:07.182 --> 03:12:08.984
BUT WHAT WE ALSO KNOW IS THAT

03:12:09.050 --> 03:12:10.518
CLEAR PURE BUS BREAKS DOWN IN

03:12:10.585 --> 03:12:12.687
THE ENVIRONMENT ALSO TO TRY

03:12:12.754 --> 03:12:13.922
CLEAR APPEARED IN ALL.

03:12:13.989 --> 03:12:16.591
SO IT'S BEEN ESTIMATED BY -- A

03:12:16.658 --> 03:12:18.560
GOVERNMENT SCIENTIST THAT UP

03:12:18.627 --> 03:12:22.097
280% OF WHAT YOU'RE DETECTING IN

03:12:22.163 --> 03:12:23.298
HUMAN URINE.

03:12:23.365 --> 03:12:24.232
IS TRICOLOR APPEARED IN ALL THAT

03:12:24.299 --> 03:12:25.734
WAS ON YOUR FRUITS AND

03:12:25.800 --> 03:12:28.303
VEGETABLES NOT THE PARENT CLICK

03:12:28.370 --> 03:12:30.238
HERE FOR US SO THIS A BURSTING

03:12:30.305 --> 03:12:32.340
WHAT WERE MAJOR IN ISN'T CLERK

03:12:32.407 --> 03:12:34.175
YOUR BOSS AT ALL.

03:12:34.242 --> 03:12:35.810
SECONDLY FOR TRICOR APPEARED IN

03:12:35.877 --> 03:12:38.280
ALL IS VERY NON TOXIC AS A VERY

03:12:38.346 --> 03:12:40.248
DIFFERENT TOXICOLOGY PROFILE

03:12:40.315 --> 03:12:41.783
BAND CHLORPYRIFOS.

03:12:41.850 --> 03:12:44.185
THIRDS CDC ITSELF REMINDS US

03:12:44.252 --> 03:12:46.087
THAT JUST DETECTING SOMETHING

03:12:46.154 --> 03:12:47.589
DOESN'T IN FOR HARM.

03:12:47.656 --> 03:12:49.024
AND BECAUSE OUR ANALYTICAL

03:12:49.090 --> 03:12:52.227
CHEMISTRY IS SO -- ROBUST NOW WE

03:12:52.294 --> 03:12:53.962
CAN DETECT VERY VERY SMALL

03:12:54.029 --> 03:12:55.964
AMOUNTS THAT WE COULDN'T DO

03:12:56.031 --> 03:12:57.499
TWENTY YEARS AGO [inaudible]

03:12:57.565 --> 03:13:00.235
OKAY -- SO BASICALLY YOU'RE

03:13:00.302 --> 03:13:01.136
YOU'RE YOU'RE MONITORING THE

03:13:01.202 --> 03:13:02.971
METABOLITES THAT'S RIGHT AND SO

03:13:03.038 --> 03:13:05.740
THE THE HUMAN LIVER IS VERY --

03:13:05.807 --> 03:13:08.743
GOOD AT CLEARING OUT -- TOXINS

03:13:08.810 --> 03:13:12.447
WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO DO -- BUT

03:13:12.514 --> 03:13:13.448
ONE THING IT DOESN'T DO AS IT

03:13:13.515 --> 03:13:15.317
DOESN'T TALK ABOUT -- WHAT THE

03:13:15.383 --> 03:13:17.218
THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT IS DOING

03:13:17.285 --> 03:13:18.553
TO THE BODY PRIOR TO IT BEING

03:13:18.620 --> 03:13:19.788
METABOLIZED RIGHT?

03:13:19.854 --> 03:13:21.456
I MEAN IT'S IT DOES POTENTIALLY

03:13:21.523 --> 03:13:23.124
HAVE SOME AFFECTS.

03:13:23.191 --> 03:13:25.293
SO WE'VE HEARD SOME DISCUSSION --

03:13:25.360 --> 03:13:26.795
BY THE OTHERS SPEAKERS TODAY

03:13:26.861 --> 03:13:28.830
ABOUT -- THE EFFECTS THAT ARE

03:13:28.897 --> 03:13:30.732
SEEN IN LABORATORY ANIMALS AND I

03:13:30.799 --> 03:13:32.801
WOULD REMIND THEM THAT -- DOES

03:13:32.867 --> 03:13:34.102
LABORATORY ANIMAL STUDIES ARE

03:13:34.169 --> 03:13:37.205
DONE AT A MILLION TIMES HIGHER.

03:13:37.272 --> 03:13:39.107
AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING IT AND THE

03:13:39.174 --> 03:13:40.608
HUMAN BODIES IN THESE -- BY

03:13:40.675 --> 03:13:42.410
MONITORING PROGRAMS AND THE FOOD

03:13:42.477 --> 03:13:46.381
RESIDENTS A MILLION TIMES.

03:13:46.448 --> 03:13:47.549
OKAY.

03:13:47.615 --> 03:13:49.184
SO THE P. R. IS GONE INVOLVED

03:13:49.250 --> 03:13:51.786
AND JUSTIFIABLY SO AND I AND I'M

03:13:51.853 --> 03:13:53.488
NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND WHY WE'RE

03:13:53.555 --> 03:13:55.223
PREEMPTING THEIR REVIEW.

03:13:55.290 --> 03:13:57.492
BUT THE NOW CLASSIFIED AS A

03:13:57.559 --> 03:13:59.361
RESTRICTED MATERIAL ONLY TRAINED

03:13:59.427 --> 03:14:01.229
LICENSED PROFESSIONALS BUT THE

03:14:01.296 --> 03:14:03.398
PERMIT -- FROM A LOCAL COUNTY

03:14:03.465 --> 03:14:04.866
AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONER MAY

03:14:04.933 --> 03:14:05.900
USE THESE PRODUCTS CONTAINING

03:14:05.967 --> 03:14:06.901
THE PESTICIDE.

03:14:06.968 --> 03:14:08.336
THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IT

03:14:08.403 --> 03:14:09.771
WAS ADDED TO CALIFORNIA'S PROP

03:14:09.838 --> 03:14:12.874
SIXTY MY LIST OF CHEMICALS KNOWN

03:14:12.941 --> 03:14:13.408
TO CAUSE REPRODUCTIVE HARM

03:14:13.475 --> 03:14:13.708
[inaudible]

03:14:13.775 --> 03:14:15.610
AND SO -- IT HAS ALSO BEEN SHOWN

03:14:15.677 --> 03:14:18.213
THAT THE UTILIZATION OF THIS

03:14:18.279 --> 03:14:21.683
PESTICIDE IS DOWN 50% FROM

03:14:21.750 --> 03:14:23.852
200-052-2000 SIXTEEN ARE THERE

03:14:23.918 --> 03:14:24.185
ANY.

03:14:24.252 --> 03:14:27.622
MODERN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES.

03:14:27.689 --> 03:14:28.890
THAT SHOW WHAT'S HAPPENING -- IN

03:14:28.957 --> 03:14:31.626
THE TWO WEEKS TO TWO THOUSAND

03:14:31.693 --> 03:14:32.193
FIFTEEN SIXTEEN TIME PERIOD

03:14:32.260 --> 03:14:34.062
RIGHT SO MOST EPIDEMIOLOGY

03:14:34.129 --> 03:14:35.864
STUDIES THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING

03:14:35.930 --> 03:14:38.500
ABOUT -- OF OUR OWN CHILDREN

03:14:38.566 --> 03:14:40.468
BORN LONG BEFORE THAT -- THERE

03:14:40.535 --> 03:14:42.504
ARE SOME MORE RECENT STUDIES OF

03:14:42.570 --> 03:14:44.172
NOT IN CALIFORNIA ONE IN THE

03:14:44.239 --> 03:14:45.940
NETHERLANDS ALSO SHOWING NO

03:14:46.007 --> 03:14:47.842
ADVERSE EFFECTS -- WITH RESPECT

03:14:47.909 --> 03:14:51.012
HI Q. -- WE HAD THE RECENT

03:14:51.079 --> 03:14:53.715
AUTISM STUDY FROM UC DAVIS

03:14:53.782 --> 03:14:55.550
SHOWING NO -- ATTACKS WITH FOR

03:14:55.617 --> 03:14:57.585
PURE BOSTON ARTISAN SO I THINK

03:14:57.652 --> 03:14:58.820
THOSE KINDS OF STUDIES GIVE THIS

03:14:58.887 --> 03:15:02.590
REASSURANCE THAT -- WE ARE THE

03:15:02.657 --> 03:15:04.325
MODERN DAY METHODS OR THE MODERN

03:15:04.392 --> 03:15:08.897
DAY STUDY METHODOLOGY AREN'T

03:15:08.963 --> 03:15:10.632
SHOWING AN EFFECT.

03:15:10.698 --> 03:15:13.034
OKAY AND AND SO -- WHAT IS YOUR

03:15:13.101 --> 03:15:17.272
RESPONSE? TO THREE PROPONENTS.

03:15:17.338 --> 03:15:19.207
LIST OF WHAT APPEARS TO BE SOME

03:15:19.274 --> 03:15:20.275
VERY INTELLIGENT PEOPLE.

03:15:20.341 --> 03:15:24.045
WITH MD DEGREES PH DIS -- THAT

03:15:24.112 --> 03:15:25.680
ARE RAISING THE FLAGS ARE

03:15:25.747 --> 03:15:26.815
CONCERNED WHAT BOOK WHAT WOULD

03:15:26.881 --> 03:15:28.416
YOU TELL US THAT ARE READING

03:15:28.483 --> 03:15:28.950
THESE [inaudible]

03:15:29.017 --> 03:15:30.552
THESE WARNINGS.

03:15:30.618 --> 03:15:32.754
RIGHT WELL AND AND MY COLLEAGUE

03:15:32.821 --> 03:15:33.988
HERE I I YOU KNOW I RESPECT

03:15:34.055 --> 03:15:35.223
THEIR THEIR OPINIONS AND SO

03:15:35.290 --> 03:15:37.425
FORTH BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT.

03:15:37.492 --> 03:15:38.993
TO COMPARE LIKE WITH LIKE THAT

03:15:39.060 --> 03:15:40.195
WE CAN'T JUST COMPARE ALL

03:15:40.261 --> 03:15:42.297
ORGANIC PHOSPHATES IN THIS

03:15:42.363 --> 03:15:43.131
CONVERSATION TODAY ABOUT

03:15:43.198 --> 03:15:44.466
CHLORPYRIFOS.

03:15:44.532 --> 03:15:46.034
THE QUESTION IS IS IT CLICK HERE

03:15:46.101 --> 03:15:47.669
FOR US THAT'S THE QUESTION ON

03:15:47.735 --> 03:15:50.638
THE TABLE AND IT'S EASY TO LOOK

03:15:50.705 --> 03:15:52.607
AT ALL OUR GAL FIVE SPEEDS AND

03:15:52.674 --> 03:15:54.843
MANY DIFFERENT -- DISEASES IN

03:15:54.909 --> 03:15:56.611
DIFFERENT STUDIES THE SCIENTIFIC

03:15:56.678 --> 03:15:58.446
PROCESS DEMANDS THAT WE LOOK

03:15:58.513 --> 03:15:59.681
LIKE FOR LIKE.

03:15:59.747 --> 03:16:01.349
IF WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT I. Q.

03:16:01.416 --> 03:16:03.051
LIST LOOK AT I. Q. -- THE

03:16:03.118 --> 03:16:04.919
COLUMBIA STUDY LOOKED AT WORKING

03:16:04.986 --> 03:16:07.021
MEMORY WELL THE TO MARCUS STUDY

03:16:07.088 --> 03:16:09.023
DIDN'T FIND AT SO I THINK IT'S

03:16:09.090 --> 03:16:11.226
IMPORTANT.

03:16:11.292 --> 03:16:12.427
TO FOCUS ON CLICK HERE FOR US

03:16:12.494 --> 03:16:18.533
TODAY -- DESPITE -- APPEARANCES

03:16:18.600 --> 03:16:20.802
THAT YOU KNOW THERE MAY BE A FAX

03:16:20.869 --> 03:16:22.237
ALLEN A BROADER SCALE.

03:16:22.303 --> 03:16:23.404
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT IN THE LETTER

03:16:23.471 --> 03:16:24.639
DOES TALK ABOUT KEFIR FAUCET IT

03:16:24.706 --> 03:16:26.474
DOES TALK ABOUT OTHER ORGAN

03:16:26.541 --> 03:16:28.476
PHOSPHATE SO IT'S IT IS KINDA

03:16:28.543 --> 03:16:31.279
LUMPING EVERYTHING TOGETHER.

03:16:31.346 --> 03:16:33.014
BUT THERE ARE INTERMISSIONS

03:16:33.081 --> 03:16:34.048
WHICH ICLUDES BANNING ALL

03:16:34.115 --> 03:16:35.216
AERIAL APPLICATIONS OF CLICK

03:16:35.283 --> 03:16:35.783
HERE FONT.

03:16:35.850 --> 03:16:37.785
DISCONTINUED USE ON MOST CROPS

03:16:37.852 --> 03:16:38.786
IT'LL BE RESTRICTED TO CRITICAL

03:16:38.853 --> 03:16:40.755
CROPS SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW

03:16:40.822 --> 03:16:42.557
IS OKAY IF THIS BAND WERE TO

03:16:42.624 --> 03:16:43.791
BECOME LAW.

03:16:43.858 --> 03:16:45.827
WHAT CROPS IN CALIFORNIA ARE WE

03:16:45.894 --> 03:16:47.162
AT RISK OF?

03:16:47.228 --> 03:16:50.098
NOT BEING ABLE TO APPROPRIATELY

03:16:50.165 --> 03:16:53.601
GROW.

03:16:53.668 --> 03:16:55.470
THANK YOU SENATOR OF OUR KNOWING

03:16:55.537 --> 03:16:57.539
HE CHECK -- SO SOME OF THE

03:16:57.605 --> 03:16:58.540
ISSUES THAT WE DO HAVE LIKE IN

03:16:58.606 --> 03:17:00.975
OUR CITRUS GROVES.

03:17:01.042 --> 03:17:03.077
IS -- THEIR SUGAR RAMPS THESE

03:17:03.144 --> 03:17:04.212
ALSO AFFECTS SOME OF OUR NOT

03:17:04.279 --> 03:17:05.947
CROPS AND UNFORTUNATELY IT'S

03:17:06.014 --> 03:17:08.850
JUST VERY VERY HARD TO KNOCK

03:17:08.917 --> 03:17:10.718
DOWN SUGAR AND POPULATIONS --

03:17:10.785 --> 03:17:11.653
THEY'RE VERY AGGRESSIVE

03:17:11.719 --> 03:17:14.255
CHLORPYRIFOS IS ONE IS IS THE

03:17:14.322 --> 03:17:15.924
ONLY THING THAT'S EFFECTIVE ON

03:17:15.990 --> 03:17:16.824
THEM AND KNOCKING DOWN THEIR

03:17:16.891 --> 03:17:17.892
POPULATIONS AND ONE OF THE

03:17:17.959 --> 03:17:19.327
PROBLEMS WE SHOULD GRANT.

03:17:19.394 --> 03:17:21.062
IS THAT THEY PROTECT OTHER

03:17:21.129 --> 03:17:22.964
INVASIVE PESTS BECAUSE THEY LIKE

03:17:23.031 --> 03:17:24.532
TO COLLECT THE HONEY DO YOU OFF

03:17:24.599 --> 03:17:25.433
OF THOSE PASSED IN THE NAY

03:17:25.500 --> 03:17:27.268
ACTUALLY HER HARM BENEFICIAL

03:17:27.335 --> 03:17:28.169
INSECTS.

03:17:28.236 --> 03:17:28.836
SO WHEN YOU GET THESE

03:17:28.903 --> 03:17:30.138
INFESTATION OF SUGAR ANTS YOU

03:17:30.205 --> 03:17:31.973
JUST NEED TO KNOCK HIM DOWN

03:17:32.040 --> 03:17:33.474
BECAUSE THEY'RE HOARDING OTHER

03:17:33.541 --> 03:17:34.943
PASS AND HURTING ARE BENEFICIAL

03:17:35.009 --> 03:17:37.579
INSECTS -- ANOTHER ONE ON OUR ON

03:17:37.645 --> 03:17:40.515
<u>&lt;c.green&gt;OTTON -- THERE IS ANY IF IT&lt;/c&gt;</u>

03:17:40.582 --> 03:17:43.184
DIED -- IS DETRIMENTAL TO COTTON

03:17:43.251 --> 03:17:44.619
IT CAUSES IT IT'S CALLED STICKY

03:17:44.686 --> 03:17:47.088
COTTON -- AND IT BASICALLY

03:17:47.155 --> 03:17:48.823
BECOMES SO THAT YOU CAN'T SELL

03:17:48.890 --> 03:17:51.092
YOUR COTTON -- CHLORPYRIFOS IN

03:17:51.159 --> 03:17:52.660
THIS WAS DONE BY RESEARCH BY THE

03:17:52.727 --> 03:17:55.063
UC'S IS THE ONLY.

03:17:55.129 --> 03:17:57.198
TOOL THAT YOU CAN USE ON THIS

03:17:57.265 --> 03:17:59.534
PAST AND IF THAT CAN'T BECOME

03:17:59.601 --> 03:18:01.469
STICKY -- THE MILLS WILL REJECT

03:18:01.536 --> 03:18:03.238
IT SO BASICALLY YOUR CROP IS

03:18:03.304 --> 03:18:04.973
GONE SO THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF

03:18:05.039 --> 03:18:06.207
THE EXAMPLES OF WHY WE NEED A

03:18:06.274 --> 03:18:11.646
AND AGAIN LIKE I SAID THIS IS

03:18:11.713 --> 03:18:12.880
JUST ONE TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX.

03:18:12.947 --> 03:18:14.349
FARMERS TRY ALL DIFFERENT TYPES

03:18:14.415 --> 03:18:15.149
OF METHODS BEFORE THEY GET TO

03:18:15.216 --> 03:18:16.718
KIND OF THIS ORGANIC PHOSPHATE

03:18:16.784 --> 03:18:18.987
AND USING CORPORA FOSS BUT

03:18:19.053 --> 03:18:19.988
SOMETIMES WITH THESE INVASIVE

03:18:20.054 --> 03:18:21.756
PESTS THERE'S REALLY NOTHING

03:18:21.823 --> 03:18:22.590
ELSE.

03:18:22.657 --> 03:18:25.059
OUT THERE THAT JUST KNOCKS THEM

03:18:25.126 --> 03:18:26.394
DOWN AND GET THEM OUT OF THE WAY

03:18:26.461 --> 03:18:28.830
OKAY SO SO THE THE SENATOR --

03:18:28.896 --> 03:18:30.965
MADE REFERENCE TO TO RATE THAT --

03:18:31.032 --> 03:18:32.634
WE USED TO BE IN RATE AND THEN

03:18:32.700 --> 03:18:34.769
IT WAS RECLASSIFIED IF ANOTHER

03:18:34.836 --> 03:18:36.304
CHEMICAL THAT COULD DO THE JOB

03:18:36.371 --> 03:18:37.005
SO.

03:18:37.071 --> 03:18:38.172
AFTER HEARING WHAT YOU JUST SAID

03:18:38.239 --> 03:18:39.774
IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT -- THIS

03:18:39.841 --> 03:18:41.342
THIS PESTICIDE IS USES A LAST

03:18:41.409 --> 03:18:44.646
RESULT RESORT TO SAVE A PRODUCT

03:18:44.712 --> 03:18:45.913
THAT WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO

03:18:45.980 --> 03:18:47.815
CULTIVATE A CALIFORNIA CORRECT

03:18:47.882 --> 03:18:50.585
OKAY AND THEN -- ON THE PASSAGE

03:18:50.652 --> 03:18:51.452
PESTICIDE RESIDUE ISSUE YOU KNOW

03:18:51.519 --> 03:18:53.621
YOU YOU YOU EXPLAIN HOW IT THE

03:18:53.688 --> 03:18:55.523
CROPS ARE TESTED TO MAKE SURE

03:18:55.590 --> 03:18:57.025
THAT THERE IS NO RESIDUE SO IS

03:18:57.091 --> 03:18:59.694
IT UP TO THE FARMER TO ENSURE

03:18:59.761 --> 03:19:01.296
THAT WHEN THOSE ARE DELIVERED

03:19:01.362 --> 03:19:03.264
THEIR THEIR CROPS -- LET'S SEE

03:19:03.331 --> 03:19:04.532
THE THE ORANGES OR OR WHATEVER

03:19:04.599 --> 03:19:05.767
TO THE GROCERY STORE WHO'S

03:19:05.833 --> 03:19:11.406
RESPONSIBLE TO CLEAN THOSE CROPS

03:19:11.472 --> 03:19:11.939
TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS NO

03:19:12.006 --> 03:19:12.674
RESIDUE.

03:19:12.740 --> 03:19:13.975
AND THAT DOES COME UNDER FARMERS

03:19:14.042 --> 03:19:14.842
AND PACKING SHEDS AND HOWEVER

03:19:14.909 --> 03:19:15.743
THAT SUPPLY CHAIN GOES PART OF

03:19:15.810 --> 03:19:16.911
NOT HAVING RESIDUE ON YOUR CROPS

03:19:16.978 --> 03:19:18.613
THOUGH IS THOSE RESTRICTIONS

03:19:18.680 --> 03:19:20.081
THAT DPR HAS PUT IN PLACE.

03:19:20.148 --> 03:19:22.317
OF WHEN THINGS CAN BE APPLIED

03:19:22.383 --> 03:19:24.719
ONE REENTRY IS HOW YOU HAVE TO

03:19:24.786 --> 03:19:26.220
APPLY THEM BEFORE HARVEST SO

03:19:26.287 --> 03:19:28.156
THERE'S A LOT OF RESTRICTIONS IN

03:19:28.222 --> 03:19:30.658
PLACE ON ALL PESTICIDES.

03:19:30.725 --> 03:19:33.161
ON WHEN AND HOW YOU APPLY THEM

03:19:33.227 --> 03:19:33.728
TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS NOT

03:19:33.795 --> 03:19:34.662
RESIDUE.

03:19:34.729 --> 03:19:36.431
THEN THERE STEPS AFTER THAT AND

03:19:36.497 --> 03:19:37.965
THEN THAT'S WHEN DPR STEPS IN

03:19:38.032 --> 03:19:39.867
AND SAMPLES TO ENSURE THAT NO

03:19:39.934 --> 03:19:41.402
ONE'S DOING ANYTHING ILLEGALLY --

03:19:41.469 --> 03:19:43.271
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE REALLY

03:19:43.338 --> 03:19:44.539
GET INTO THESE ISSUES BUT

03:19:44.605 --> 03:19:45.640
THERE'S RESTRICTIONS ON THE

03:19:45.707 --> 03:19:46.708
GROUND AND THEN FARMERS ARE

03:19:46.774 --> 03:19:48.443
RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT

03:19:48.509 --> 03:19:49.577
THOSE ARE BEING FOLLOWED SO

03:19:49.644 --> 03:19:50.845
THERE IS NOT THIS RESIDUE ISSUE

03:19:50.912 --> 03:19:52.280
SO IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT IT IS

03:19:52.347 --> 03:19:53.781
THE CONSUMER THIS MAN.

03:19:53.848 --> 03:19:55.316
DOESN'T HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY

03:19:55.383 --> 03:19:56.718
OF ENSURING THAT THE RESIDUE IS

03:19:56.784 --> 03:19:58.252
NOT ON THE FRUIT THAT IS UP TO

03:19:58.319 --> 03:20:00.655
THE THE GROWER AT CENTER ACT AND

03:20:00.722 --> 03:20:01.756
THAT'S WHY DEEP HERE AND SEE IF

03:20:01.823 --> 03:20:02.623
THEY HAVE PARTNERED UP AND WHY

03:20:02.690 --> 03:20:04.392
THERE IS SUCH A ROBUST.

03:20:04.459 --> 03:20:09.097
PROGRAM TO ENSURE -- IN

03:20:09.163 --> 03:20:10.732
20001796% OF THE SAMPLES HAD

03:20:10.798 --> 03:20:12.767
EITHER NO DETECTION A RESIDUE OR

03:20:12.834 --> 03:20:16.037
WAS FAR BELOW USEPA TOLERANCE

03:20:16.104 --> 03:20:17.538
LEVELS THAT WERE REQUIRED.

03:20:17.605 --> 03:20:19.307
OF THE 4% THAT DID HAVE LEGAL

03:20:19.374 --> 03:20:21.376
RESIDUE 72% OF THAT WAS FROM OUT

03:20:21.442 --> 03:20:23.511
OF COUNTRY SO THAT SOME OF THE

03:20:23.578 --> 03:20:24.779
RESIDUE ISSUES THAT WE'RE

03:20:24.846 --> 03:20:25.446
DEALING WITH TO THESE ARE COMING

03:20:25.513 --> 03:20:26.347
FROM.

03:20:26.414 --> 03:20:29.217
OUT OF COUNTRY IN CALIFORNIA WE

03:20:29.283 --> 03:20:33.020
ARE VERY RESTRICTIVE.

03:20:33.087 --> 03:20:34.088
THANK YOU FOR YOUR ANSWERS.

03:20:34.155 --> 03:20:36.624
THANK YOU CEREMONY.

03:20:36.691 --> 03:20:37.525
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ON THINK

03:20:37.592 --> 03:20:38.793
THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS

03:20:38.860 --> 03:20:39.761
FORWARD IN [inaudible]

03:20:39.827 --> 03:20:41.262
SOME.

03:20:41.329 --> 03:20:43.064
APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY OF

03:20:43.131 --> 03:20:47.368
SUPPORTERS AND OPPONENTS -- YOU

03:20:47.435 --> 03:20:48.803
KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT

03:20:48.870 --> 03:20:53.307
PESTICIDES IN USE IN CALIFORNIA.

03:20:53.374 --> 03:20:54.942
DURING MY WORK THAT INVOLVED

03:20:55.009 --> 03:20:56.944
REPRESENTING VICTIMS OF

03:20:57.011 --> 03:20:58.713
PESTICIDE EXPOSURE.

03:20:58.780 --> 03:21:03.684
WE SAW A DD EIGHTEEN T. OKAY

03:21:03.751 --> 03:21:05.620
MEDICINE STOCKS ARE VERY

03:21:05.686 --> 03:21:07.054
DIFFERENT PESTICIDES YOU KNOW

03:21:07.121 --> 03:21:08.189
THEY HAD IN COMMON.

03:21:08.256 --> 03:21:10.258
THEY WERE ALL EVENTUALLY BANNED

03:21:10.324 --> 03:21:13.561
BY THE EPA AFTER.

03:21:13.628 --> 03:21:17.498
FARMWORKERS HAD SUFFERED ILLNESS.

03:21:17.565 --> 03:21:18.499
A CHRONIC.

03:21:18.566 --> 03:21:21.135
ILLNESS BIRTH DEFECTS IN

03:21:21.202 --> 03:21:25.673
WRONGFUL DEATH AFTER EXPOSURE --

03:21:25.740 --> 03:21:27.642
THE CHEMICALS THAT WERE APPROVED

03:21:27.708 --> 03:21:29.644
BY THE EPA.

03:21:29.710 --> 03:21:31.045
THE ONES THAT I MENTIONED ALL

03:21:31.112 --> 03:21:32.814
USE SOMETHING CALLED ECONOMIC

03:21:32.880 --> 03:21:34.382
NECESSITY.

03:21:34.449 --> 03:21:36.517
SO THEY FOR STONE GOING THROUGH

03:21:36.584 --> 03:21:38.786
THE PHONE ANIMAL STUDIES AND

03:21:38.853 --> 03:21:41.055
ALLOWED EXPEDITED ACCESS OF THE

03:21:41.122 --> 03:21:44.392
CHEMICALS INTO THE MARKET PLACE

03:21:44.459 --> 03:21:46.928
BECAUSE THEY WERE SO IMPORTANT.

03:21:46.994 --> 03:21:48.396
FOR USE IN AGRICULTURE.

03:21:48.463 --> 03:21:50.198
THAT WAS IN AN ERA WHEN

03:21:50.264 --> 03:21:50.932
FARMWORKERS.

03:21:50.998 --> 03:21:52.266
WERE [inaudible]

03:21:52.333 --> 03:21:56.537
REALLY -- DISCOUNTED.

03:21:56.604 --> 03:22:00.308
IN THE CONCERN FOR EXPOSURE.

03:22:00.374 --> 03:22:03.110
FAST FORWARD TO TODAY IN TWO

03:22:03.177 --> 03:22:04.445
CONSTITUENTS OF MINE.

03:22:04.512 --> 03:22:07.181
SCHOOL TEACHERS PARENTS STUDENTS

03:22:07.248 --> 03:22:09.083
CONCERNED ABOUT APPLICATIONS

03:22:09.150 --> 03:22:10.585
NEAR SCHOOLS.

03:22:10.651 --> 03:22:13.421
SO DPR HAS CONVENED PUBLIC

03:22:13.488 --> 03:22:15.189
HEARINGS.

03:22:15.256 --> 03:22:16.090
DAVE.

03:22:16.157 --> 03:22:19.427
CREATED GREATER CONTROLS AND

03:22:19.494 --> 03:22:20.495
RECOMMENDATIONS.

03:22:20.561 --> 03:22:21.729
NO APPLICATION DURING SCOOL

03:22:21.796 --> 03:22:23.164
HOURS.

03:22:23.231 --> 03:22:26.000
SO THAT THAT PROTECTS STUDENTS

03:22:26.067 --> 03:22:28.402
IN SCHOOL DURING SCHOOL HOURS.

03:22:28.469 --> 03:22:30.371
BUT THEN I CREATE SO A WINDOW ON

03:22:30.438 --> 03:22:31.939
WEEKENDS.

03:22:32.006 --> 03:22:33.307
THAT IF YOU CAN'T SPREE DURING

03:22:33.374 --> 03:22:34.942
SCHOOL HOURS YOU'RE GONNA SPRING

03:22:35.009 --> 03:22:36.344
ON THE WEEKEND.

03:22:36.410 --> 03:22:38.246
SO THERE MAY NOT BE STUDENTS IN

03:22:38.312 --> 03:22:40.047
CLASSES AT THE SCHOOL.

03:22:40.114 --> 03:22:41.349
BUT IF THERE RESIDENTS IN

03:22:41.415 --> 03:22:44.051
NEIGHBORHOODS NEAR THAT SCHOOL.

03:22:44.118 --> 03:22:46.120
THEY ARE NOT EVACUATED THEY ARE

03:22:46.187 --> 03:22:48.122
NOT WORN SO THEY ARE NOT

03:22:48.189 --> 03:22:49.824
NECESSARILY PROTECTED.

03:22:49.891 --> 03:22:51.626
AND THEY MAY ALSO BE THE HOMES

03:22:51.692 --> 03:22:54.862
OF CHILDREN THAT ATTEND THAT

03:22:54.929 --> 03:22:56.564
NEIGHBOR OR SCHOOL.

03:22:56.631 --> 03:22:59.100
THE SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION.

03:22:59.166 --> 03:23:01.002
WE ALWAYS GET TONED IT'S NOT

03:23:01.068 --> 03:23:04.005
CONCLUSIVE WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH

03:23:04.071 --> 03:23:05.740
LET'S JUST STUDY A LITTLE BIT

03:23:05.806 --> 03:23:07.608
LONGER.

03:23:07.675 --> 03:23:08.442
WELL.

03:23:08.509 --> 03:23:10.611
IF YOU ARE THE PARENT OF A CHILD

03:23:10.678 --> 03:23:13.047
WHO HAS SUFFERED FROM EXPOSURE.

03:23:13.114 --> 03:23:14.682
AND IF YOU LIVE IN THE SALINAS

03:23:14.749 --> 03:23:16.784
VALLEY AND YOUR KIDS THAT LIVE

03:23:16.851 --> 03:23:18.152
AROUND THE SPREE AREAS.

03:23:18.219 --> 03:23:22.623
HAVE SHOWN PROVEN -- THE

03:23:22.690 --> 03:23:25.393
DEFICIENCY IN I. Q. AND BRAIN

03:23:25.459 --> 03:23:29.363
DEVELOPMENT -- YOU CAN'T WAIT.

03:23:29.430 --> 03:23:30.698
FOR ANOTHER TWO YEARS.

03:23:30.765 --> 03:23:33.434
ANOTHER TEN YEARS ANOTHER TWENTY

03:23:33.501 --> 03:23:35.903
YEARS -- THIS LEGISLATURE HAS

03:23:35.970 --> 03:23:37.972
NOT PRACTICED [inaudible]

03:23:38.039 --> 03:23:40.141
PICKING CHEMICALS IN BANNING

03:23:40.207 --> 03:23:41.709
THEM.

03:23:41.776 --> 03:23:44.045
VERY FREQUENTLY THE LAST TIME I

03:23:44.111 --> 03:23:46.280
REMEMBER WAS WITH THE CHEMICAL

03:23:46.347 --> 03:23:47.848
CALLED METHYL AYE AND DIED.

03:23:47.915 --> 03:23:48.950
IN IT WAS SEEN AS A GOOD

03:23:49.016 --> 03:23:51.285
ALTERNATIVE TO METHYL BROMIDE

03:23:51.352 --> 03:23:52.720
WHICH IS AN OZONE DEPLETING.

03:23:52.787 --> 03:23:54.755
SO WAS LESS TOXIC TO THE

03:23:54.822 --> 03:23:56.457
ENVIRONMENT.

03:23:56.524 --> 03:23:58.526
INTERESTINGLY IT WAS OF MUCH

03:23:58.593 --> 03:24:00.361
GREATER TOXICITY.

03:24:00.428 --> 03:24:02.330
IN HUMAN EXPOSURE.

03:24:02.396 --> 03:24:05.066
IT COULD BE LETHAL IN VERY VERY

03:24:05.132 --> 03:24:06.801
SMALL AMOUNTS.

03:24:06.867 --> 03:24:08.302
THE MANUFACTURE ON THAT ONE

03:24:08.369 --> 03:24:11.105
EVENTUALLY WITHDREW ITS REQUEST

03:24:11.172 --> 03:24:12.239
FOR PERMANENT FOR USE IN

03:24:12.306 --> 03:24:13.474
CALIFORNIA.

03:24:13.541 --> 03:24:15.843
IN ALL THE CROPS THAT SAID DEAN

03:24:15.910 --> 03:24:18.312
DEPENDED ON THE USE OF MATH

03:24:18.379 --> 03:24:19.714
ONLINE DIED TO SURVIVE.

03:24:19.780 --> 03:24:21.349
THEY'RE STILL BEING GROWN IN THE

03:24:21.415 --> 03:24:23.250
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

03:24:23.317 --> 03:24:25.419
SO I THINK ULTIMATELY.

03:24:25.486 --> 03:24:26.988
IT IS A BALANCING TEST.

03:24:27.054 --> 03:24:29.991
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WORK OF

03:24:30.057 --> 03:24:33.594
DPR TO EXPAND THE BUFFER ZONES.

03:24:33.661 --> 03:24:36.030
TO MAYBE DO SOME MORE MONITORING

03:24:36.097 --> 03:24:37.965
AND TO TRY TO PROTECT SCHOOL

03:24:38.032 --> 03:24:39.200
SITES.

03:24:39.266 --> 03:24:42.269
THERE'S ALWAYS THE EXCEPTIONS OF

03:24:42.336 --> 03:24:44.739
WHO DOES GET EXPOSED AYE AYE.

03:24:44.805 --> 03:24:45.706
THAT'S A BIT OF A STATEMENT I

03:24:45.773 --> 03:24:47.308
NOW I DO WANT TO ASK THE

03:24:47.375 --> 03:24:49.243
PROPONENT WITNESSES EITHER ONE

03:24:49.310 --> 03:24:50.511
OF YOU.

03:24:50.578 --> 03:24:52.413
THE SCIENTISTS.

03:24:52.480 --> 03:24:53.648
WE READ ABOUT.

03:24:53.714 --> 03:24:57.118
TOLERANCE LEVELS RESIDUE LEVELS --

03:24:57.184 --> 03:24:58.686
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT A LOT

03:24:58.753 --> 03:25:01.255
OF THE EPA TOLERANCE LEVELS ARE

03:25:01.322 --> 03:25:03.491
BASED ON SOME OF THEM GO BACK TO

03:25:03.557 --> 03:25:05.092
WORLD WAR.

03:25:05.159 --> 03:25:08.162
TWO SOLDIERS MAN A HUNDRED

03:25:08.229 --> 03:25:09.430
THIRTY FIVE POUNDS OR HEAVIER.

03:25:09.497 --> 03:25:11.966
DOES THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT AN

03:25:12.033 --> 03:25:17.371
INFANT OR A CHILD WHO MAY BE --

03:25:17.438 --> 03:25:18.806
A QUARTER OF THAT NGUYEN.

03:25:18.873 --> 03:25:20.474
AN EIGHTH OF THAT LINK

03:25:20.541 --> 03:25:20.775
[inaudible]

03:25:20.841 --> 03:25:24.679
SENATOR THE EPA DOES LOOK AT

03:25:24.745 --> 03:25:26.280
DIFFERENT LEVELS OF EXPOSURE FOR

03:25:26.347 --> 03:25:27.715
DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS.

03:25:27.782 --> 03:25:28.916
WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT WHEN

03:25:28.983 --> 03:25:31.652
THEY LOOKED AT D. EXPOSURE

03:25:31.719 --> 03:25:32.953
LEVELS TO CORPORATE COSTS ON

03:25:33.020 --> 03:25:34.689
FOOD IN THEIR LAST RISK

03:25:34.755 --> 03:25:36.190
ASSESSMENT UNDER THE OBAMA

03:25:36.257 --> 03:25:37.558
ADMINISTRATION.

03:25:37.625 --> 03:25:39.827
THEY FOUND THAT INFANTS WERE

03:25:39.894 --> 03:25:41.896
EXPOSED TO NINETY TIMES WHAT THE

03:25:41.962 --> 03:25:44.765
AGENCY CONSIDERED SAFE -- EXPOSE

03:25:44.832 --> 03:25:45.833
THE CHILDREN WANTED TO YEARS OF

03:25:45.900 --> 03:25:47.501
AGE ARE EXPOSED TO ONE HUNDRED

03:25:47.568 --> 03:25:49.070
AND FORTY TIMES.

03:25:49.136 --> 03:25:51.272
BUT THE AGENCY CONSIDERS SAFE.

03:25:51.338 --> 03:25:53.441
AND SO EPA.

03:25:53.507 --> 03:25:55.710
BASED ON THEIR METHODOLOGY.

03:25:55.776 --> 03:25:58.012
THIS FINDING THAT -- CORPORATE

03:25:58.079 --> 03:25:59.513
FALLS ON FOOD DOES POSE RISKS TO

03:25:59.580 --> 03:26:00.781
INFANTS AND CHILDREN.

03:26:00.848 --> 03:26:02.650
AND HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

03:26:02.717 --> 03:26:05.953
AS PART OF A DVRS REVIEW.

03:26:06.020 --> 03:26:07.488
OF CORPORATE COSTS THE

03:26:07.555 --> 03:26:09.356
DEPARTMENT DID CONDUCT A TOXIC

03:26:09.423 --> 03:26:11.025
AIR CONTAMINANT EVALUATION AND

03:26:11.092 --> 03:26:13.260
THEY LIKE WHAT IT'S LIKE USEPA.

03:26:13.327 --> 03:26:14.729
FOUND THAT THE LEVELS OF

03:26:14.795 --> 03:26:16.764
EXPOSURE TO PREPARE A FALSE ON

03:26:16.831 --> 03:26:19.567
FOOD AND THE DRINKING WATER --

03:26:19.633 --> 03:26:21.435
WERE UNSAFE FOR INFANTS FOR

03:26:21.502 --> 03:26:22.903
YOUNG CHILDREN FOR OLDER

03:26:22.970 --> 03:26:24.371
CHILDREN AND FOR WOMEN OF

03:26:24.438 --> 03:26:25.406
REPRODUCTIVE AGE.

03:26:25.473 --> 03:26:26.941
SO WE HAVE THIS CONSISTENCY

03:26:27.007 --> 03:26:28.776
ACROSSTHE AGENCIES THAT LOOKED

03:26:28.843 --> 03:26:29.777
AT THIS ISSUE.

03:26:29.844 --> 03:26:31.812
AND THEY FOUND THAT CHILDREN ARE

03:26:31.879 --> 03:26:33.314
EXPOSED TO TOO MUCH QUICKER

03:26:33.380 --> 03:26:33.981
FALLS ON FOOD.

03:26:34.048 --> 03:26:35.950
IS THAT A FAIR STATEMENT TO SAY

03:26:36.016 --> 03:26:37.918
I THINK IN YOUR STATEMENT.

03:26:37.985 --> 03:26:40.187
THAT THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION

03:26:40.254 --> 03:26:43.824
EPA HAD REACHED A CONCLUSION.

03:26:43.891 --> 03:26:45.860
TO DISALLOW THE CONTINUED USE OF

03:26:45.926 --> 03:26:47.128
CORE PAIR FOR US.

03:26:47.194 --> 03:26:49.029
YES THEY CONCLUDED BASED ON

03:26:49.096 --> 03:26:50.264
THEIR RISK ASSESSMENTS THAT

03:26:50.331 --> 03:26:52.333
CORPORATE BOSS DOES NOT MEET THE

03:26:52.399 --> 03:26:53.300
SAFETY STANDARD AND THEY DID

03:26:53.367 --> 03:26:55.202
PROPOSED A BAN ON ALL FOOD USES

03:26:55.269 --> 03:26:56.170
OF CORPORATE OFFICE.

03:26:56.237 --> 03:27:00.674
IN THE RESTORATION OF THE FROM.

03:27:00.741 --> 03:27:01.475
THE GREEN LIGHT IF YOU WILL BY

03:27:01.542 --> 03:27:02.943
THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION

03:27:03.010 --> 03:27:04.311
THAT'S CURRENTLY BEING

03:27:04.378 --> 03:27:06.914
CHALLENGED IN THE COURTS.

03:27:06.981 --> 03:27:08.849
BUT YES IT IS SENATOR AND THAT'S

03:27:08.916 --> 03:27:10.718
WHY LAST YEAR A FEDERAL APPEALS

03:27:10.785 --> 03:27:11.685
COURT.

03:27:11.752 --> 03:27:13.220
ORDER THE EPA TO PANEL USES A

03:27:13.287 --> 03:27:14.288
CORPORATE BOSS AND WHAT'S THE

03:27:14.355 --> 03:27:16.857
STATUS OF THAT LITIGATION SAID

03:27:16.924 --> 03:27:19.393
ON APPEAL NOW.

03:27:19.460 --> 03:27:21.962
IT HAS BEEN APPEALED FURTHER BY

03:27:22.029 --> 03:27:24.565
USEPA AN ORAL ARGUMENT IN THAT

03:27:24.632 --> 03:27:25.966
APPEAL WAS HEARD LAST MONTH --

03:27:26.033 --> 03:27:27.268
THE PROCESS IS LIKELY TO

03:27:27.334 --> 03:27:28.969
CONTINUE FOR A GREAT DEAL OF

03:27:29.036 --> 03:27:29.804
TIME.

03:27:29.870 --> 03:27:33.040
IN PENDING THE CONCLUSION OF THE

03:27:33.107 --> 03:27:33.474
LITIGATION IS SEEN.

03:27:33.541 --> 03:27:34.975
SOME.

03:27:35.042 --> 03:27:36.844
THE PRIOR DETERMINATION TO

03:27:36.911 --> 03:27:39.747
DISCONTINUE THE USE STATE.

03:27:39.814 --> 03:27:41.982
IN OTHER WORDS THEY CAN CONTINUE

03:27:42.049 --> 03:27:44.385
TO USE IT PENDING.

03:27:44.451 --> 03:27:45.486
THE OUTLANDER FOSTER'S CONTINUE

03:27:45.553 --> 03:27:47.755
TO BE USED ON FOOD DESPITE US

03:27:47.822 --> 03:27:50.558
CPS CONCLUSIONS AND DESPITE THE

03:27:50.624 --> 03:27:53.260
PRS CONCLUSIONS THANK YOU -- IF

03:27:53.327 --> 03:27:54.295
I COULD MISTER CHAIR JUST A

03:27:54.361 --> 03:27:56.130
FINAL QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR --

03:27:56.197 --> 03:27:59.733
WE WERE PROVIDED -- A DRAFT OF

03:27:59.800 --> 03:28:01.936
PROPOSED SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE

03:28:02.002 --> 03:28:04.505
AMENDMENTS -- YOU MIGHT HAVE

03:28:04.572 --> 03:28:06.507
MENTIONED THIS BUT ARE ARE YOU

03:28:06.574 --> 03:28:08.809
ACCEPTING THESE PROPOSED

03:28:08.876 --> 03:28:10.845
AMENDMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE.

03:28:10.911 --> 03:28:15.749
IN THIS I READ THIS -- THERE ARE.

03:28:15.816 --> 03:28:17.852
TWO SEPARATE CRITERIA THAT WOULD

03:28:17.918 --> 03:28:20.187
HAVE TO BE MET. TO ALLOW FOR THE

03:28:20.254 --> 03:28:22.122
RESTORATION OF THE USE AND IT'S

03:28:22.189 --> 03:28:24.158
BASED ON SCIENCE AND IT'S BASED

03:28:24.225 --> 03:28:26.527
ON LOOKING AT THE EFFICACY OF

03:28:26.594 --> 03:28:29.230
CONTROL MEASURES ADOPTED BY T.

03:28:29.296 --> 03:28:30.497
P. R..

03:28:30.564 --> 03:28:32.766
IN A INDEPENDENT DETERMINATION

03:28:32.833 --> 03:28:34.468
THAT THOSE WOULD NOT RESULT IN

03:28:34.535 --> 03:28:36.437
RURAL DEVELOPMENT HARM TO

03:28:36.503 --> 03:28:41.041
CHILDREN SECRETARY -- SO.

03:28:41.108 --> 03:28:43.043
THOSE WOULD BE THE AMENDMENT SO

03:28:43.110 --> 03:28:45.446
AGAIN I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR

03:28:45.512 --> 03:28:47.548
FOR HER WORK ON THIS FOR THOSE

WHO HAVE TRAVELED -- I DO

03:28:49.350 --> 03:28:50.818
UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS OF

03:28:50.885 --> 03:28:53.587
AGRICULTURE I THINK ONE THING

03:28:53.654 --> 03:28:54.755
THAT MARKS THE HISTORY OF

03:28:54.822 --> 03:28:56.790
CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE IS

03:28:56.857 --> 03:28:58.225
ADAPTATION.

03:28:58.292 --> 03:28:59.693
ADAPTATION THE WEATHER

03:28:59.760 --> 03:29:02.596
ADAPTATION TO WATER TO DROUGHT --

03:29:02.663 --> 03:29:05.165
ADAPTATION TO CHANGING SOIL

03:29:05.232 --> 03:29:06.967
CONDITIONS AND IT'S HAD TO

03:29:07.034 --> 03:29:08.903
INCLUDE THE ADAPTATION TO

03:29:08.969 --> 03:29:10.237
DIFFERENT CHEMICALS THAT HAVE

03:29:10.304 --> 03:29:12.172
COME ON THE MARKET IN CHEMICALS

03:29:12.239 --> 03:29:13.240
THAT HAVE BEEN.

03:29:13.307 --> 03:29:16.210

THE PREVENTIVE IN PRECAUTIONARY

03:29:26.487 --> 03:29:28.389
APPROACH TO PROTECTING.

03:29:28.455 --> 03:29:29.757

IT I FEEL THAT THESE ARE JUST

03:30:44.131 --> 03:30:45.966
KEY QUESTIONS THAT I NEED TO BE

03:30:46.033 --> 03:30:47.201

SO YOU KNOW MONTH SO QUESTIONS

03:30:52.006 --> 03:30:53.440
LIKE THE NUMBER OF PERMITS.

03:30:53.507 --> 03:30:55.075
THAT ARE IN DISTRICT FORT SENATE

03:30:55.142 --> 03:30:56.910
DISTRICT FOURTEEN THAT HAVE THAT

03:30:56.977 --> 03:31:01.915
HAVE BEEN GIVEN OUT -- AND IN

03:31:01.982 --> 03:31:03.250
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- ALSO

03:31:03.317 --> 03:31:03.817
WHEN IT COMES TO RESIDUE AND

03:31:03.884 --> 03:31:05.452
THEN.

03:31:05.519 --> 03:31:06.053
STILL TRY TO GET AN

03:31:06.120 --> 03:31:07.488
UNDERSTANDING I KNOW THAT WHEN

03:31:07.554 --> 03:31:09.023
IT COMES TO CITRUS A LOT OF IT

03:31:09.089 --> 03:31:10.924
IS BEING EXPORTED I KNOW YOU

03:31:10.991 --> 03:31:13.594
MENTIONED -- HOW ARE?

03:31:13.660 --> 03:31:15.129
ARE YOU KNOW.

03:31:15.195 --> 03:31:16.964
A LOT OF THE FOOD THAT WE EAT

03:31:17.031 --> 03:31:18.232
AND AND IT'S FOUND IN THE YOU

03:31:18.298 --> 03:31:19.266
KNOW AS AS RESIDUE AND WHAT'S

03:31:19.333 --> 03:31:21.168
FOUND IN OUR BODY -- IS BEING

03:31:21.235 --> 03:31:24.805
IMPORTED SO WHAT -- WHAT IS B.

03:31:24.872 --> 03:31:26.673
E. YOU KNOW AT THE PERCENTAGE OF

03:31:26.740 --> 03:31:28.842
THE AMOUNT THAT WE WERE

03:31:28.909 --> 03:31:31.678
PURCHASING AT THE STORES WHAT --

03:31:31.745 --> 03:31:33.180
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH OF IT.

03:31:33.247 --> 03:31:36.083
THAT WORK IS SIX CONSUMING IS IT

03:31:36.150 --> 03:31:38.752
FROM -- IMPORTER PRODUCTS VERSUS

03:31:38.819 --> 03:31:41.789
UP YOU KNOW -- YOU KNOW LOCALLY

03:31:41.855 --> 03:31:43.891
GROWN PRODUCTS.

03:31:43.957 --> 03:31:45.359
I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF YOU HAVE

03:31:45.426 --> 03:31:47.061
ANY ANSWERS FOR ANY OF THOSE

03:31:47.127 --> 03:31:51.231
QUESTIONS BUT I DON'T HAVE THE

03:31:51.298 --> 03:31:53.000
EXACT NUMBER ON THAT BY BE HAPPY

03:31:53.067 --> 03:31:54.835
TO LOOK INTO.

03:31:54.902 --> 03:31:57.771
IMPORTS FORCES EXPORTS ON A LOT

03:31:57.838 --> 03:32:00.007
OF THESE COMMODITIES.

03:32:00.074 --> 03:32:01.875
SO -- AGAIN IT ONE THING THAT I

03:32:01.942 --> 03:32:03.544
FIND REASSURING IT BACK TO THE

03:32:03.610 --> 03:32:06.680
QUESTION ABOUT -- THE LEVELS IN

03:32:06.747 --> 03:32:08.615
URINE BECAUSE THAT THAT IS THE

03:32:08.682 --> 03:32:11.485
FUNCTION ONE OF THE THE VALUES

03:32:11.552 --> 03:32:12.953
OF THE CDC BIO MONITORING

03:32:13.020 --> 03:32:15.055
PROGRAM BECAUSE IT ESSENTIALLY

03:32:15.122 --> 03:32:18.258
IS THAT NEXT LEVEL OF TESTING SO.

03:32:18.325 --> 03:32:20.027
WE HAVE PROGRAMS ALL AROUND THE

03:32:20.094 --> 03:32:23.030
COUNTRY TO TEST RESIDUES IMPORTS

03:32:23.097 --> 03:32:24.531
AND AND OTHERWISE IN OUR MARKET

03:32:24.598 --> 03:32:27.768
BASKET SURVEYS RESIDUE CENTER

03:32:27.835 --> 03:32:29.136
FOOD AT STEP.

03:32:29.203 --> 03:32:30.604
ONE THE QUESTION IS WHAT WHAT'S

03:32:30.671 --> 03:32:31.238
GETTING INTO OUR BODIES THAT'S

03:32:31.305 --> 03:32:32.072
WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO KNOW

03:32:32.139 --> 03:32:33.607
BECAUSE BY THE TIME YOU BRING IT

03:32:33.674 --> 03:32:35.943
HOME FROM THE GROCERY STORE.

03:32:36.009 --> 03:32:37.978
AND YOU WATCH IT YOU PREPARE IT.

03:32:38.045 --> 03:32:39.713
THAT RESIDUE MAY BE GONE ANYWAY.

03:32:39.780 --> 03:32:41.281
SO WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS WHAT

03:32:41.348 --> 03:32:42.683
WE'RE NOT FINDING IS THAT THE

03:32:42.749 --> 03:32:44.818
LEVELS IN CHILDREN.

03:32:44.885 --> 03:32:47.554
WOMEN AND MEN IN AMERICA ACROSS

03:32:47.621 --> 03:32:49.056
THE SAMPLE.

03:32:49.123 --> 03:32:51.725
IS VERY VERY LOW AND CERTAINLY

03:32:51.792 --> 03:32:54.261
THAT'S A QUESTION FOR THIS PANEL

03:32:54.328 --> 03:32:56.697
AND FOR THE U. S. EPA FOR DPR IS

03:32:56.763 --> 03:32:58.765
IS WHAT IS LOW MAINTENANCE THAT

03:32:58.832 --> 03:32:59.366
LOW ENOUGH.

03:32:59.433 --> 03:33:00.868
I MEAN THAT'S A THAT'S A WHOLE

03:33:00.934 --> 03:33:03.170
NOTHER DAY'S TOPIC BUT BUT THAT

03:33:03.237 --> 03:33:05.506
IS THE REASSURANCE TO ME AS A AS

03:33:05.572 --> 03:33:06.173
A MOTHER.

03:33:06.240 --> 03:33:09.309
THAT THE RESIDUES ARE NOT

03:33:09.376 --> 03:33:09.610
[inaudible]

03:33:09.676 --> 03:33:12.112
UNDULY PROBLEMATIC.

03:33:12.179 --> 03:33:13.747
SO I'LL GO AHEAD AND AND FINISH

03:33:13.814 --> 03:33:15.215
THE QUESTIONS AND IF YOU HAVE A

03:33:15.282 --> 03:33:16.416
THE ANSWERS TWENTY OF THEM

03:33:16.483 --> 03:33:18.418
PLEASE FEEL FREE TO SPEAK UP --

03:33:18.485 --> 03:33:20.020
YOU KNOW BUT I I WILL SAY THAT I

03:33:20.087 --> 03:33:22.055
MIXED YOU KNOW EXTREMELY

03:33:22.122 --> 03:33:24.458
CONCERNED WITH -- DPR NOT BEING

03:33:24.525 --> 03:33:26.393
ABLE TO RESOLVE THIS -- WE

03:33:26.460 --> 03:33:27.594
SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE HERE WE

03:33:27.661 --> 03:33:28.662
SHOULDN'T HAVE TO WAIT THE

03:33:28.729 --> 03:33:31.565
SHOULD BE ALREADY RESOLVED SO --

03:33:31.632 --> 03:33:32.766
YOU KNOW WILL BE UPSTANDING FROM

03:33:32.833 --> 03:33:34.968
THIS BILL TODAY BUT I WANT TO GO

03:33:35.035 --> 03:33:36.170
AHEAD AND CHALLENGE.

03:33:36.236 --> 03:33:38.539
BOTH TO BOTH SIDES TO BE ABLE TO

03:33:38.605 --> 03:33:40.240
PROVIDE ME WITH THE ANSWERS TO

03:33:40.307 --> 03:33:41.041
SOME OF THE QUESTIONS I'LL BE

03:33:41.108 --> 03:33:41.675
ASKING.

03:33:41.742 --> 03:33:43.610
SO MONTHS THOSE ARE -- WHEN

03:33:43.677 --> 03:33:45.312
THERE APPEARS TO BE COMPETING

03:33:45.379 --> 03:33:46.747
SCIENCE ANY PARTICULAR PESTICIDE

03:33:46.813 --> 03:33:47.381
AND ITS IMPACT ON MY

03:33:47.447 --> 03:33:48.715
CONSTITUENTS AND ALL

03:33:48.782 --> 03:33:51.151
CALIFORNIANS WHAT STATE AGENCY

03:33:51.218 --> 03:33:52.986
IS CALLED UPON TO VALIDATE

03:33:53.053 --> 03:33:53.420
FINDINGS?

03:33:53.487 --> 03:33:55.355
NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO DO WE HAVE

03:33:55.422 --> 03:33:58.091
HEALTH DATA FROM THE STATE THAT

03:33:58.158 --> 03:33:59.293
ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE.

03:33:59.359 --> 03:34:00.761
WHY WHY HAS IT TAKEN SO LONG FOR

03:34:00.827 --> 03:34:02.362
THE STATE? TO REACT TO THIS

03:34:02.429 --> 03:34:03.163
ISSUE.

03:34:03.230 --> 03:34:04.831
DO WE NEED TO REVIEW THE PROCESS

03:34:04.898 --> 03:34:06.266
CURRENTLY BEING USED TO ANALYZE

03:34:06.333 --> 03:34:08.669
ANALYZE DATA ON PESTICIDE USE IN

03:34:08.735 --> 03:34:11.071
IMPACTS TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN

03:34:11.138 --> 03:34:13.307
THE POLICIES BEING APPLIED.

03:34:13.373 --> 03:34:14.508
HOW MANY FARMWORKERS DO WE HAVE

03:34:14.575 --> 03:34:15.943
IN CALIFORNIA AND CALIFORNIA

03:34:16.009 --> 03:34:17.144
THAT ARE IMPACTED BY THIS

03:34:17.211 --> 03:34:18.579
PESTICIDE?

03:34:18.645 --> 03:34:20.047
WHAT TYPE OF JOB FOR ME

03:34:20.113 --> 03:34:21.281
POSITIONS ARE IMPACTED BY THIS

03:34:21.348 --> 03:34:23.016
LEGISLATION?

03:34:23.083 --> 03:34:24.284
WHAT JOBS ARE IMPACTED OUTSIDE

03:34:24.351 --> 03:34:25.586
FARMS LIKE?

03:34:25.652 --> 03:34:28.522
TRUCKERS ARE PACKING HOUSES.

03:34:28.589 --> 03:34:30.057
KIND OF BACK TO CHEAT ON THE

03:34:30.123 --> 03:34:32.426
RESIDUE -- ISSUES WHILE WILL

03:34:32.492 --> 03:34:33.894
THERE BE.

03:34:33.961 --> 03:34:35.529
A LOSS OF FARM WORKING JOBS IF

03:34:35.596 --> 03:34:36.930
THIS PASSES.

03:34:36.997 --> 03:34:38.932
IF SO HOW MANY.

03:34:38.999 --> 03:34:41.668
BY AND DO WE HAVE OTHER JOB

03:34:41.735 --> 03:34:42.736
OPPORTUNITIES LINED UP FOR THEM

03:34:42.803 --> 03:34:46.039
IF SO.

03:34:46.106 --> 03:34:47.174
AND ACCORDING TO THE STUDY

03:34:47.241 --> 03:34:48.675
RESIDUE EXPOSURE CAN CAUSE US

03:34:48.742 --> 03:34:49.276
HARM TO CHILL AND DO WE KNOW

03:34:49.343 --> 03:34:51.478
THAT. TO THE EXTENT OF THE

03:34:51.545 --> 03:34:52.913
IMPACT OF RESIDUE EXPOSURE

03:34:52.980 --> 03:34:55.282
VISITS VERSUS APPLICATION

03:34:55.349 --> 03:34:56.083
EXPOSURE.

03:34:56.149 --> 03:34:57.417
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF CALIFORNIA

03:34:57.484 --> 03:34:58.952
GROWN PRODUCTS ARE FOUND IN

03:34:59.019 --> 03:35:00.587
CALIFORNIA GROCERY STORES AS A

03:35:00.654 --> 03:35:02.356
TOUCHED ON EARLIER?

03:35:02.422 --> 03:35:03.090
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF NON

03:35:03.156 --> 03:35:05.025
CALIFORNIA GROWN PRODUCTS ARE

03:35:05.092 --> 03:35:05.592
FOUND IN CALIFORNIA GROCERY

03:35:05.659 --> 03:35:06.526
STORES?

03:35:06.593 --> 03:35:07.828
ARE THESE PRODUCTS GROANING

03:35:07.894 --> 03:35:10.530
CALIFORNIA MOSTLY EXPORTED HOW

03:35:10.597 --> 03:35:12.499
MUCH OF THESE PRODUCTS TO

03:35:12.566 --> 03:35:14.668
CURRENT DUKE CURRENTLY WE IMPORT.

03:35:14.735 --> 03:35:16.503
AND HOW IS THAT EXPOSURE

03:35:16.570 --> 03:35:18.171
MEASURED SO.

03:35:18.238 --> 03:35:21.341
IF YOU HAVE ANY OF THOSE.

03:35:21.408 --> 03:35:22.676
YOU KNOW ASK QUESTIONS.

03:35:22.743 --> 03:35:23.744
THE ANSWERS TO THE ANY OF THOSE

03:35:23.810 --> 03:35:25.078
QUESTIONS PLEASE FEEL FREE TO

03:35:25.145 --> 03:35:27.681
ANSWER THEM NOW BUT I'D BE HAPPY.

03:35:27.748 --> 03:35:29.016
TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS AS WE

03:35:29.082 --> 03:35:31.818
MOVE ALONG.

03:35:31.885 --> 03:35:35.455
YEAH I'M ALL TO SAY A FEW WORDS --

03:35:35.522 --> 03:35:37.858
ABOUT -- THIS ISSUE OF

03:35:37.924 --> 03:35:42.496
DISCREPANCIES A ACROSS STUDIES --

03:35:42.562 --> 03:35:44.131
ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH AS

03:35:44.197 --> 03:35:46.400
SCIENTISTS WHEN WE'LL EVALUATING

03:35:46.466 --> 03:35:50.270
A BODY OF EVIDENCE -- IS THAT.

03:35:50.337 --> 03:35:51.204
WE EXPECT TO BE SOME

03:35:51.271 --> 03:35:52.806
INCONSISTENCY FROM ONE

03:35:52.873 --> 03:35:54.675
POPULATION TO THE NEXT BECAUSE

03:35:54.741 --> 03:35:56.243
PEOPLE ARE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT

03:35:56.310 --> 03:35:58.245
COMMUNITIES MAY HAVE OTHER CO

03:35:58.312 --> 03:35:59.846
EXPOSURES OTHER.

03:35:59.913 --> 03:36:02.683
HEALTH ISSUES -- BUT HERE WE'RE

03:36:02.749 --> 03:36:05.018
TALKING ABOUT BRAIN DEVELOPMENT

03:36:05.085 --> 03:36:07.621
AND WHETHER ONE SAID THE HAPPENS

03:36:07.688 --> 03:36:09.056
TO FIND I. Q. AND OTHER ONE

03:36:09.122 --> 03:36:11.191
FINDS AUTISM ANOTHER ONE FINDS

03:36:11.258 --> 03:36:14.828
ADHD ALL OF THESE ARE SERIOUS.

03:36:14.895 --> 03:36:16.663
DEFICITS IN PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO

03:36:16.730 --> 03:36:18.231
FUNCTION AND TO LEAD FULL

03:36:18.298 --> 03:36:19.933
PRODUCTIVE LIVES AND REACH THEIR

03:36:20.000 --> 03:36:21.001
POTENTIAL.

03:36:21.068 --> 03:36:24.604
SO I THINK -- WE DON'T NEED TO

03:36:24.671 --> 03:36:26.640
MAKE THOSE DISTINCTIONS IN OTHER

03:36:26.707 --> 03:36:28.675
WORDS THIS IS BEYOND IF ONE

03:36:28.742 --> 03:36:30.444
STUDY IS SEEING A LITTLE MORE

03:36:30.510 --> 03:36:33.113
SOMETHING ELSE -- AS FAR AS

03:36:33.180 --> 03:36:36.249
APPLICATIONS VERSUS WHAT -- YOU

03:36:36.316 --> 03:36:37.651
KNOW AND WHAT'S IN THE FOOD.

03:36:37.718 --> 03:36:39.119
THERE HAVE BEEN ACTUALLY SEVERAL

03:36:39.186 --> 03:36:41.088
VERY STRONG STUDIES SHOWING THAT

03:36:41.154 --> 03:36:44.157
IF YOU TAKE IT A FAMILY AND YOU

03:36:44.224 --> 03:36:45.492
REPLACE THEIR CONVENTIONAL

03:36:45.559 --> 03:36:47.694
CONVENTIONALLY GROWN PRODUCE.

03:36:47.761 --> 03:36:50.364
WITH ORGANICALLY GROWN PRODUCE.

03:36:50.430 --> 03:36:52.632
WITHIN A WEEK ALL OF THOSE

03:36:52.699 --> 03:36:54.568
RESIDUES IN THE URINE ARE GONE.

03:36:54.634 --> 03:36:56.770
IN OTHER WORDS.

03:36:56.837 --> 03:36:58.605
THEY ARE NOT ABSORBING IT.

03:36:58.672 --> 03:37:00.640
FROM THIS IS IN CHILDREN THIS IS

03:37:00.707 --> 03:37:02.876
IN YOUNG CHILDREN -- SEVERAL

03:37:02.943 --> 03:37:04.711
STUDIES THAT HAVE HAVE ACTUALLY

03:37:04.778 --> 03:37:06.313
DONE THAT EXPERIMENT.

03:37:06.380 --> 03:37:08.682
AND REMOVED THE CONVENTIONAL

03:37:08.749 --> 03:37:09.750
PRODUCE THAT HAD IT WOULD HAVE

03:37:09.816 --> 03:37:11.218
HAD PESTICIDE RESIDUES AND

03:37:11.284 --> 03:37:14.087
THEY'RE NOT FINDING THESE THESE

03:37:14.154 --> 03:37:15.756
CHEMICALS SO -- THAT SEEMS TO BE

03:37:15.822 --> 03:37:18.925
A MAJOR ROUTE OF EXPOSURE IS

03:37:18.992 --> 03:37:20.193
THROUGH THE FOOD RESIDUES.

03:37:20.260 --> 03:37:22.295
ARE BASED ON THE SCIENCE THAT'S

03:37:22.362 --> 03:37:23.730
BEEN DONE ON THOSE.

03:37:23.797 --> 03:37:25.665
ARE AND AND THEN IN TERMS OF

03:37:25.732 --> 03:37:28.368
APPLICATIONS AND REALLY WHETHER

03:37:28.435 --> 03:37:30.036
PEOPLE EXPOSED TO AND I'M GONNA

03:37:30.103 --> 03:37:32.639
REFER TO THE AUTISM STUDY THAT --

03:37:32.706 --> 03:37:33.974
I I ACTUALLY IN THE SENIOR

03:37:34.040 --> 03:37:35.308
AUTHOR ON THE CAME OUT OF UC

03:37:35.375 --> 03:37:37.043
DAVIS.

03:37:37.110 --> 03:37:41.348
AND IN THAT CITY WE USE THE THE

03:37:41.415 --> 03:37:42.816
THE AMOUNT OF POUNDS THAT HAVE

03:37:42.883 --> 03:37:44.284
BEEN APPLIED.

03:37:44.351 --> 03:37:46.353
AROUND THE HOME WITHIN A MILE OR

03:37:46.420 --> 03:37:47.187
SO.

03:37:47.254 --> 03:37:49.589
AND THAT WAS THE MEASURE THAT WE

03:37:49.656 --> 03:37:51.224
USE TO DETERMINE WHO IS EXPOSING

03:37:51.291 --> 03:37:53.126
WHO WASN'T.

03:37:53.193 --> 03:37:55.095
WE FOUND THAT THE MOTHERS WHO

03:37:55.162 --> 03:37:56.430
WERE EXPOSED TO THE CLERK HERE

03:37:56.496 --> 03:37:58.365
PH<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;PECIFICALLY FOR PARA&lt;/c&gt;</u>

03:37:58.432 --> 03:38:02.068
FIRST APPLICATIONS NOT ARE THERE

03:38:02.135 --> 03:38:03.370
ORGAN OF PHOSPHATE TEST SITES --

03:38:03.437 --> 03:38:04.204
WERE THE ONES THAT HAD THE

03:38:04.271 --> 03:38:06.273
HIGHEST CHRIS FOR AUTISM AND IF

03:38:06.339 --> 03:38:07.908
IT WAS IN THE SECOND TRIMESTER

03:38:07.974 --> 03:38:10.610
WE SAW A THREEFOLD HIGHER RISK

03:38:10.677 --> 03:38:13.346
FOR AUTISM IN THOSE CHILDREN.

03:38:13.413 --> 03:38:14.781
THERE'S ALSO A STUDY THAT GOES

03:38:14.848 --> 03:38:16.416
BACK OUT OF A WILD EARLIER THAN

03:38:16.483 --> 03:38:18.185
THAT CITY BY THE WAY MOST OF

03:38:18.251 --> 03:38:19.786
THOSE CHILDREN WERE AFTER THE

03:38:19.853 --> 03:38:22.155
BAND -- THE VAST MAJORITY OF

03:38:22.222 --> 03:38:24.825
THEM WERE BORN AFTER THE BAND ON

03:38:24.891 --> 03:38:26.493
THE HOUSEHOLD USE OF PESTICIDES

03:38:26.560 --> 03:38:29.095
TO THE REALLY IT'S IT WAS THE

03:38:29.162 --> 03:38:31.298
AGRICULTURAL -- APPLICATIONS

03:38:31.364 --> 03:38:32.365
THAT WERE.

03:38:32.432 --> 03:38:34.067
THAT WE WERE LOOKING AT IN THAT

03:38:34.134 --> 03:38:35.969
STUDY.

03:38:36.036 --> 03:38:40.841
AND I THINK MAYBE THAT WAS IT I

03:38:40.907 --> 03:38:42.409
HAD ANOTHER POINT THAT I'VE

03:38:42.476 --> 03:38:44.411
GOTTEN ITSELF.

PEOPLE SAFE AND I KNOW THAT'S

03:41:09.522 --> 03:41:11.491
WHAT'S BEHIND.

YOUR BILL -- ON THE QUESTIONS OF

03:41:14.260 --> 03:41:16.963
SCIENCE -- WE MIGHT HAVE A BIT

03:41:17.030 --> 03:41:18.164
MORE.

03:41:18.231 --> 03:41:19.399
THE VARIANCE IN TERMS OF OUR

03:41:19.466 --> 03:41:21.434
ABILITY.

03:41:21.501 --> 03:41:22.869
TO LOOK ACROSS THE SCIENTIFIC

03:41:22.936 --> 03:41:24.437
LUGER SO FOR SOMEONE AND IN MANY

03:41:24.504 --> 03:41:25.839
WAYS YOU THINK ABOUT IT WE DID --

03:41:25.905 --> 03:41:27.507
YOU KNOW SIX METAPHOR SIX MEN

03:41:27.574 --> 03:41:29.843
AGAINST WE DID A JOURNAL CLUB AT

03:41:29.909 --> 03:41:31.878
AND AT UC DAVIS IT WOULD BE AN

03:41:31.945 --> 03:41:33.246
HOUR YOU KNOW GOING OVER A PAPER

03:41:33.313 --> 03:41:35.715
SO -- THE THE ABILITY TO

03:41:35.782 --> 03:41:36.716
ACTUALLY DELVE INTO AND WE'RE

03:41:36.783 --> 03:41:37.450
HERE TO HER IDEA IF DIFFERENT

03:41:37.517 --> 03:41:39.152
TESTIMONY AND I I DO APPRECIATE

03:41:39.219 --> 03:41:40.387
BOTH THE PROPONENTS AND

03:41:40.453 --> 03:41:42.689
OPPONENTS SHARING WITH ME PAPERS --

03:41:42.756 --> 03:41:45.025
THAT -- I'VE DONE IT AND ADD UP

03:41:45.091 --> 03:41:46.026
TO YOU TO LOOK AT AND ANALYZE

03:41:46.092 --> 03:41:48.194
AND AND AND AND I WOULD SAY IS

03:41:48.261 --> 03:41:50.530
THAT -- IN IN LOOKING AT THOSE

03:41:50.597 --> 03:41:52.632
AGAIN YOU KNOW I'M THERE OTHER

03:41:52.699 --> 03:41:53.967
PEOPLE OR SMARMY WHO KNOWS THAT

03:41:54.034 --> 03:41:56.870
THERE'S EVEN BETTER INCLUDING AS

03:41:56.936 --> 03:41:58.004
SOMEONE SITTING IN HIS ROOM

03:41:58.071 --> 03:41:59.506
MIGHT.

03:41:59.572 --> 03:42:01.441
DISCLOSE I WORKED WITH --

03:42:01.508 --> 03:42:02.709
AVERAGE PER CHILD -- AND SOME

03:42:02.776 --> 03:42:04.411
OTHERS FIELDS AROUND

03:42:04.477 --> 03:42:05.912
EPIDEMIOLOGY AND AND HOW THEIR

03:42:05.979 --> 03:42:15.755
SPECTER -- WORK IS THAT -- WHAT

03:42:15.822 --> 03:42:17.991
I SEE IN THE PAPERS THAT YOU

03:42:18.058 --> 03:42:19.092
KNOW IS IT IS IT DEFINITIVELY

03:42:19.159 --> 03:42:21.628
THE ABSOLUTELY THE RIGHT BECAUSE

03:42:21.695 --> 03:42:24.497
THESE ARE METABOLIZED VERSUS --

03:42:24.564 --> 03:42:25.699
WELL YEAH I THINK THERE'S SOME

03:42:25.765 --> 03:42:26.900
WIGGLE ROOM THERE BUT I WOULD

03:42:26.966 --> 03:42:27.734
ALSO SAY THAT EVEN THE PAPER'S

03:42:27.801 --> 03:42:28.301
WHO SUPPOSEDLY SAID WELL.

03:42:28.368 --> 03:42:29.235
WE DON'T WE DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING

03:42:29.302 --> 03:42:30.336
WE DON'T THINK BUT THERE'S A

03:42:30.403 --> 03:42:30.970
POSSIBILITY I MEAN THAT THERE

03:42:31.037 --> 03:42:32.172
WERE SOME LITTLE HINTS OF STUFF

03:42:32.238 --> 03:42:33.640
AND MORE TALKING ABOUT NOR DID

03:42:33.707 --> 03:42:34.541
ON A CHILDREN'S.

03:42:34.607 --> 03:42:35.341
RIGHT SO THE THE OUTCOME IS A

03:42:35.408 --> 03:42:35.875
VERY SERIOUS.

03:42:35.942 --> 03:42:37.077
ONE AND SO EVEN THOUGH THE

03:42:37.143 --> 03:42:38.011
PAPERS THAT'S BECAUSE HE DIDN'T

03:42:38.078 --> 03:42:39.679
SHOW ANYTHING AT ALL WHEN USED

03:42:39.746 --> 03:42:41.514
TO USE COUNT REALLY DELVE INTO

03:42:41.581 --> 03:42:44.250
THE NUMBERS THEY SAID WELL.

03:42:44.317 --> 03:42:44.884
WHAT'S WITH THE TO HAVE SUCH A

03:42:44.951 --> 03:42:45.919
IT'S THE DISCO CIGARETTES BUT

03:42:45.985 --> 03:42:47.053
THERE'S SOME THERE WERE SOME

03:42:47.120 --> 03:42:48.188
WEARING SIGNALS IN THAT RATE AND

03:42:48.254 --> 03:42:49.489
THEN THE PAPERS THAT WERE SAYING

03:42:49.556 --> 03:42:51.091
IS A PROBLEM YOU KNOW WE CAN SAY

03:42:51.157 --> 03:42:51.791
THAT WELL IT'S ACTUALLY THE

03:42:51.858 --> 03:42:53.026
SENATE IS.

03:42:53.093 --> 03:42:54.928
BUT THE IT WAS PRETTY STRONG

03:42:54.994 --> 03:42:56.730
STRONG SO IT'S I THINK GIVEN.

03:42:56.796 --> 03:42:58.431
THE TYPICALLY THE OUTCOME WE'RE

03:42:58.498 --> 03:42:59.799
TALKING ABOUT IN THE FACT THAT.

03:42:59.866 --> 03:43:01.067
EVERYONE SEEMS TO BE TAKING SOME

03:43:01.134 --> 03:43:02.769
SORT OF SIGNAL THAT SOMETHING

03:43:02.836 --> 03:43:04.304
MIGHT BE HAPPENING.

03:43:04.370 --> 03:43:06.473
IT CERTAINLY MAKES ME PRETTY

03:43:06.539 --> 03:43:09.876
WORRIED RIGHT AND AND SO YEAH

03:43:09.943 --> 03:43:12.912
BUT WHY DO YOU WANT TO DO IS SAY

03:43:12.979 --> 03:43:13.580
YOU KNOW.

03:43:13.646 --> 03:43:16.416
I I I HAVE ANAND I APPRECIATE --

03:43:16.483 --> 03:43:17.817
SANDRO'S WORKING AND US AND

03:43:17.884 --> 03:43:18.918
SPONSORED BILL IS THAT ON ONE

03:43:18.985 --> 03:43:20.153
LEVEL OF COURSE YOU KNOW I THINK

03:43:20.220 --> 03:43:21.654
WE DO NEED THE REGULATORY

03:43:21.721 --> 03:43:23.790
PROCESS TO GO AND WAY AND WHERE

03:43:23.857 --> 03:43:26.459
WE HAVE MORE OF THE OPPORTUNITY

03:43:26.526 --> 03:43:27.694
FOR THE SCIENCE BE ANALYZE AND

03:43:27.761 --> 03:43:28.795
AND THEN THE SCIENTIST AWAY AND

03:43:28.862 --> 03:43:29.162
AND AND THAT.

03:43:29.229 --> 03:43:31.231
PROCESS AND THAT'S WHY I REALLY

03:43:31.297 --> 03:43:31.765
APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE

03:43:31.831 --> 03:43:34.100
AMENDMENT AT THAT SAME TIME.

03:43:34.167 --> 03:43:35.468
YEAH I A I HEAR WHAT PEOPLE ARE

03:43:35.535 --> 03:43:36.870
SAYING THAT THE EVIDENCE THAT WE

03:43:36.936 --> 03:43:38.271
HAVE RIGHT NOW AND FOR WHATEVER

03:43:38.338 --> 03:43:40.373
REASON -- THERE MAY BE THAT THE

03:43:40.440 --> 03:43:42.175
REGULATORY PROCESS AND WE CAN

03:43:42.242 --> 03:43:43.443
ARGUE LIKE OKAY WELL DVRS

03:43:43.510 --> 03:43:45.445
LOOKING AT IT RIGHT NOW ALRIGHT

03:43:45.512 --> 03:43:46.679
AND THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DONE

03:43:46.746 --> 03:43:47.247
WHAT.

03:43:47.313 --> 03:43:48.948
IT DIDN'T NEED A YEAR AND A HALF

03:43:49.015 --> 03:43:50.850
TWO YEARS RIGHT THAT WHILE WERE

03:43:50.917 --> 03:43:51.818
AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT THEY

03:43:51.885 --> 03:43:53.653
HAVEN'T LOOKED AT IT BEFORE BUT

03:43:53.720 --> 03:43:54.854
THERE'S NEW HEALTH THERE'S

03:43:54.921 --> 03:43:55.655
ONGOING EVIDENCE RESEARCH

03:43:55.722 --> 03:43:56.890
CONTINUES THERE'S A REASON WE

03:43:56.956 --> 03:43:58.825
CONTINUE TO RESEARCH BECAUSE WE

03:43:58.892 --> 03:43:59.425
STILL HAVE QUESTIONS THAT ARE

03:43:59.492 --> 03:44:00.126
ANSWERED.

03:44:00.193 --> 03:44:02.162
AND AND IT TAKES TIME AND MONEY

03:44:02.228 --> 03:44:03.096
TO DO THAT THE ANSWERS ON JUST

03:44:03.163 --> 03:44:06.132
COME IMMEDIATELY -- THAT -- THAT

03:44:06.199 --> 03:44:07.233
GIVEN THE OUTCOME OF THE

03:44:07.300 --> 03:44:09.536
SERIOUSNESS OF THIS AND ALSO

03:44:09.602 --> 03:44:10.570
SOME CONCLUSIONS.

03:44:10.637 --> 03:44:11.471
THAT'S WHAT IS A SIMPLE ANY

03:44:11.538 --> 03:44:13.072
CONCLUSIONS REACHED BY SOME

03:44:13.139 --> 03:44:14.174
PREVIOUS REGULATORY SOMETHING

03:44:14.240 --> 03:44:15.508
REGULATORY AGENCIES THAT.

03:44:15.575 --> 03:44:17.210
IT MAKES SENSE TO SAY WELL LET'S

03:44:17.277 --> 03:44:20.246
HOLD BACK ON THIS AND LESS WE

03:44:20.313 --> 03:44:20.947
CAN.

03:44:21.014 --> 03:44:21.781
YOU KNOW UNLESS WE CAN PROVE

03:44:21.848 --> 03:44:22.549
WEEK THAT THERE ARE SOME

03:44:22.615 --> 03:44:24.584
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT AND WHICH IT

03:44:24.651 --> 03:44:36.729
COULD BE YOU MIGHT BE IS SAFE

03:44:36.796 --> 03:44:38.364
AND IT DOESN'T THEN.

03:44:38.431 --> 03:44:38.965
DON'T USE IT PERIOD RIGHT AND

03:44:39.032 --> 03:44:39.732
THAT'S OF THAT WHAT COMES OUT

03:44:39.799 --> 03:44:40.900
THAT MAYBE THE CONCLUSIONS WHAT

03:44:40.967 --> 03:44:42.035
WE DON'T KNOW NINE A PRE JUDGE

03:44:42.101 --> 03:44:42.602
CONCLUSION.

03:44:42.669 --> 03:44:43.703
AND SO I APPRECIATE THAT WHAT

03:44:43.770 --> 03:44:44.204
WE'RE GONNA DO IS WE'RE

03:44:44.270 --> 03:44:46.873
PROPOSING TO SAY LET'S.

03:44:46.940 --> 03:44:48.007
DO A HOTEL BACK ON USING IT.

03:44:48.074 --> 03:44:49.309
AND LET THE REGULATOR DO THE

03:44:49.375 --> 03:44:50.944
WORK BUT THEN SAY THAT.

03:44:51.010 --> 03:44:52.111
WE'RE GONNA LET THE REGULATORS --

03:44:52.178 --> 03:44:53.246
HAVETHE OPPORTUNITY TO SAVE ARE

03:44:53.313 --> 03:44:54.080
THERE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH WE

03:44:54.147 --> 03:44:54.380
CAN DO IT.

03:44:54.447 --> 03:44:55.949
IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T HARM OUR

03:44:56.015 --> 03:44:56.683
MAIN OUTCOME WHICH IS NO

03:44:56.749 --> 03:44:58.685
DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN AND SO

03:44:58.751 --> 03:45:00.720
THAT WE'RE NOT THE LAST WORD IS

03:45:00.787 --> 03:45:03.156
A LEGISLATURE -- BUT WE CREATE A

03:45:03.223 --> 03:45:05.024
FRAMEWORK IN WHICH TO REGULATORS

03:45:05.091 --> 03:45:05.692
CAN THEN LOOK AT THE DATA AND SO

03:45:05.758 --> 03:45:06.793
FORTH.

03:45:06.860 --> 03:45:08.361
AND BRING IT BACK TO THE RIGHT

03:45:08.428 --> 03:45:09.262

03:45:09.329 --> 03:45:11.297
REGULATORY PROCESS BACK TOGETHER --

03:45:11.364 --> 03:45:12.599
SO AND OF COURSE WE DON'T LIKE

03:45:12.665 --> 03:45:13.733
THAT WE THINK THE REGULATORY

03:45:13.800 --> 03:45:14.634
PROCESS IS A RIGOROUS OR

03:45:14.701 --> 03:45:15.969
SOMETHING WE CERTAINLY CAN PASS

03:45:16.035 --> 03:45:17.437
LAWS TO CHANGE THAT PROCESS AND

03:45:17.503 --> 03:45:19.405
IT AS WELL BUT I DON'T THINK

03:45:19.472 --> 03:45:20.073
THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS.

03:45:20.139 --> 03:45:21.274

03:47:35.308 --> 03:47:37.076
DISTURBINGLY HIGH AMONG AND

03:47:37.143 --> 03:47:38.745
AMONG THE HIGHEST IN THE NATION.

03:47:38.811 --> 03:47:39.979

SWIFT ACTION AND AGGRESSIVELY

03:47:42.248 --> 03:47:43.316
TARGET THESE HIGHWAYS WHICH

03:47:43.383 --> 03:47:44.017
FINALLY TALLY.

03:47:44.083 --> 03:47:46.152
THE LEGISLATIVE DEPARTMENT OF

HEALTH DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE

03:47:48.254 --> 03:47:49.522
AND STAKEHOLDERS HAVE INVESTED

03:47:49.589 --> 03:47:52.058
FUNDS MAN AND WOMAN POWERING

03:47:52.125 --> 03:47:53.926
COUNTLESS HOURS OF RESEARCH TO

03:47:53.993 --> 03:47:56.195

03:47:59.832 --> 03:48:01.567
AND SO ALL THE U. S. REMAINS THE

CALIFORNIA LEADS THE NATION'S AT

03:48:07.006 --> 03:48:08.474
LEAST THE NATION AS A STATE WHAT

03:48:08.541 --> 03:48:10.243
THE LAW WAS SMART.

03:48:10.309 --> 03:48:11.511
MATERNAL MORTALITY RATES.

03:48:11.577 --> 03:48:16.349
UNFORTUNATELY THAT DOES NOT

03:48:16.416 --> 03:48:17.283
APPLY TO BLACK WOMEN.

03:48:17.350 --> 03:48:19.419

MATERNAL MORTALITY IN CALIFORNIA

03:48:23.623 --> 03:48:25.792
REMAINS THREE TO FOUR TIMES

03:48:25.858 --> 03:48:27.794
HIGHER THAN THOSE OF OTHER

03:48:27.860 --> 03:48:30.063
RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS.

03:48:30.129 --> 03:48:31.330
UNLIKE MANY OTHER DISPARITIES

03:48:31.397 --> 03:48:33.366
THIS CANNOT BE EXPLAINED AWAY BY

03:48:33.433 --> 03:48:35.468
SOCIAL ECONOMIC STATUS LEVEL OF

03:48:35.535 --> 03:48:37.703
EDUCATION ACCESS TO CARE RISKY

03:48:37.770 --> 03:48:38.838
HEALTH BEHAVIORS ARE OTHERS ALSO

03:48:38.905 --> 03:48:40.206
DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH.

03:48:40.273 --> 03:48:42.475
IN FACT IN MY HOME COUNTY OF LOS

WOMEN WHO HOLD LESS THAN A HIGH

03:48:51.417 --> 03:48:53.553
SCHOOL DIPLOMA.

03:48:53.619 --> 03:48:55.455
INSTEAD THE EVIDENCE POINTS TO

03:48:55.521 --> 03:48:57.256
IMPLICIT BIAS AS ONE OF THE

03:48:57.323 --> 03:48:58.591
CAUSES FOR THESE WIDE

03:48:58.658 --> 03:48:59.859
DISPARITIES.

03:48:59.926 --> 03:49:01.427
A TWENTY SIXTEEN STUDY BY THE

03:49:01.494 --> 03:49:02.762
UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA FOUND

03:49:02.829 --> 03:49:04.363
THAT IN A SURVEY OF WHITE

03:49:04.430 --> 03:49:06.432
MEDICAL STUDENTS AND RESIDENTS.

03:49:06.499 --> 03:49:07.867
ABOUT HALF BELIEVED.

03:49:07.934 --> 03:49:10.903
ABOUT HALF BELIEVED.

03:49:10.970 --> 03:49:14.574
BIOLOGICAL MYTHS ABOUT RACIAL

03:49:14.640 --> 03:49:15.441
DIFFERENCES IN PATIENTS

03:49:15.508 --> 03:49:16.843
INCLUDING A BLACK PATIENTS HAVE

03:49:16.909 --> 03:49:17.610
LESS SENSITIVE NERVE ENDINGS ARE

03:49:17.677 --> 03:49:19.312
ABLE TO TOLERATE MORE PAIN AND

03:49:19.378 --> 03:49:21.481
HAVE THICKER SKIN THAN THEIR

03:49:21.547 --> 03:49:22.748
WHITE COUNTERPARTS.

03:49:22.815 --> 03:49:25.017
THAT WAS IT IN EIGHTEEN SIXTEEN

03:49:25.084 --> 03:49:29.188
COLLEAGUES THAT WAS IN.

03:49:29.255 --> 03:49:29.789
TWENTY SIXTEEN BLACK WOMEN ARE

03:49:29.856 --> 03:49:31.424
IN GRAVE DANGER BECAUSE WHEN

03:49:31.491 --> 03:49:32.625
THEY SAY THEY'RE IN PAINTING

03:49:32.692 --> 03:49:33.860
KRAUT PRETENSION.

03:49:33.926 --> 03:49:36.062
SOME PROVIDERS DO NOT BELIEVE

03:49:36.129 --> 03:49:36.929
THAT.

03:49:36.996 --> 03:49:40.967
AND LACK THE CULTURAL COMPETENCY

03:49:41.033 --> 03:49:42.401
TO RESPOND APPROPRIATELY.

03:49:42.468 --> 03:49:44.570
SB FOUR SIX FOUR TARGET THIS IS

03:49:44.637 --> 03:49:46.806
BARELY BY REQUIRING EVERY

HEALTHCARE PROVIDER INVOLVED

03:49:47.640 --> 03:49:49.375

03:49:50.977 --> 03:49:52.912
CENTERS TO UNDERGO EVIDENCE

03:49:52.979 --> 03:49:56.182
BASED IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING.

03:49:56.249 --> 03:49:57.216
SOME OF THESE BELIEVES AND

03:49:57.283 --> 03:49:58.784
DIFFERENCES OF STANDARDS OF CARE

03:49:58.851 --> 03:50:00.486
ARE SO SUBCONSCIOUS BUT THE

03:50:00.553 --> 03:50:02.288
PROVIDERS MAY NOT EVEN BE AWARE

03:50:02.355 --> 03:50:03.723
OF THEIR IMPLICIT BIAS.

03:50:03.789 --> 03:50:04.991
THESE TRAININGS WILL CALL

03:50:05.057 --> 03:50:06.159
ATTENTION TO INTERPERSONAL

03:50:06.225 --> 03:50:08.261
IMPLICIT BIAS SEES IN ORDER TO

CATALYZE A CULTURE IN HOSPITAL.

03:50:10.796 --> 03:50:12.331
WHERE PROVIDERS CAN DELIVER THE

03:50:12.398 --> 03:50:14.934
BEST CARE TO ALL THEIR PATIENTS?

03:50:15.001 --> 03:50:16.502
SB FOUR SIX FOUR WILL ALSO

03:50:16.569 --> 03:50:18.070
REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC

03:50:18.137 --> 03:50:19.906
HEALTH TO TRACK AND PUBLISH

03:50:19.972 --> 03:50:22.408
MATERNAL MORTALITY AND SEVERE.

03:50:22.475 --> 03:50:24.177
MORBIDITY RATES TO BETTER

03:50:24.243 --> 03:50:25.611
MONITOR THESE ISSUES AND

03:50:25.678 --> 03:50:26.979
HIGHLIGHT THE AREAS AND

03:50:27.046 --> 03:50:29.916
DEMOGRAPHICS THAT NEED FURTHER

03:50:32.051 --> 03:50:32.785
LET ME GO BACK AND SAY THAT

03:50:32.852 --> 03:50:34.220
AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE

03:50:34.287 --> 03:50:36.589

03:50:36.656 --> 03:50:38.925
THE ANALYSIS -- WE'VE BEEN

03:50:38.991 --> 03:50:40.860
WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH SOME

ADVANCED DEGREES DON'T PROTECT

03:52:35.274 --> 03:52:36.275
THEM.

03:52:36.342 --> 03:52:37.943
THIS IS NOT A TRAGEDY THAT I

03:52:38.010 --> 03:52:39.011
WANT TO FACE.

03:52:39.078 --> 03:52:40.780
BUT HOW CAN WE ADDRESS THE ROOT

03:52:40.846 --> 03:52:42.715
CAUSES OF THE TRAGEDY WE DON'T

03:52:42.782 --> 03:52:44.216
EVEN KNOW WHEN IT HAPPENS.

03:52:44.283 --> 03:52:47.119
SO IN THE U. S. B. THE ADDITION

03:52:47.186 --> 03:52:48.220
OF THE PREGNANCY RELATED

HAS IMPROVED THIS IDENTIFICATION.

03:52:54.260 --> 03:52:57.530
SO LIKE STARTING IN -- TWO

03:52:57.596 --> 03:52:58.130
THOUSAND THREE A MAJORITY OF

03:52:59.065 --> 03:53:01.667
CERTIFICATES AND MOST INCLUDED.

03:53:01.734 --> 03:53:03.402
A PREGNANCY QUESTION COMPATIBLE

03:53:03.469 --> 03:53:05.338
WITH THE W. H. O. STANDARDS

03:53:05.404 --> 03:53:07.206
EXCEPT FOR CALIFORNIA AT THAT

03:53:07.273 --> 03:53:07.807
TIME.

03:53:07.873 --> 03:53:10.242
AND WITH THAT NEW DATA NATIONAL

03:53:10.309 --> 03:53:12.044
DATA COLLECTION THE REPORTED U.

03:53:12.111 --> 03:53:14.347
S. MATURE MATERNAL MORTALITY

03:53:14.413 --> 03:53:15.981
RATE MORE THAN DOUBLED.

03:53:16.048 --> 03:53:18.284
BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY

03:53:18.351 --> 03:53:18.818
FOURTEEN BUT MOST OF THAT

03:53:18.884 --> 03:53:20.986
REPORTED INCREASE WAS ACTUALLY

03:53:21.053 --> 03:53:24.390
AN DUE TO IMPROVE ASCERTAINMENT.

03:53:24.457 --> 03:53:25.958
OF MATERNAL MORTALITY AS A

03:53:26.025 --> 03:53:27.259
CRITICAL FIRST STEP IN

03:53:27.326 --> 03:53:28.928
PREVENTION EFFORTS.

03:53:28.994 --> 03:53:31.130
AS IT CAN IDENTIFY AT RISK

03:53:31.197 --> 03:53:32.965
POPULATIONS AND MEASURE THE

03:53:33.032 --> 03:53:36.135
PROGRESS OF PREVENTION PROGRAMS.

03:53:36.202 --> 03:53:38.070
NOW THESE FINDINGS IN THE US OF

03:53:38.137 --> 03:53:39.672
INCREASING MATERNAL MORTALITY

03:53:39.739 --> 03:53:41.607
OCCURRED -- WHEN THE WHO

03:53:41.674 --> 03:53:44.877
REPORTED -- THAT A HUNDRED AND

03:53:44.944 --> 03:53:45.878
FIFTY SEVEN OF THE HUNDRED AND

03:53:45.945 --> 03:53:47.313
EIGHTY THREE STE COUNTRIES HAD

03:53:47.380 --> 03:53:48.748
DECREASING.

03:53:48.814 --> 03:53:50.182
BETWEEN THIS TIME PERIOD EXCEPT

03:53:50.249 --> 03:53:51.884
FOR THE US.

03:53:51.951 --> 03:53:53.886
THE CALIFORNIA MATERNAL QUALITY

03:53:53.953 --> 03:53:55.388
CARE COLLABORATIVE REPORTS A

03:53:55.454 --> 03:53:56.856
DECLINE IN MATERNAL MORTALITY

03:53:56.922 --> 03:53:59.058
HOWEVER THIS IS USING THE

03:53:59.125 --> 03:54:00.626
LIMITED BIRTH CERTIFICATE DATA.

03:54:00.693 --> 03:54:03.662
THEY DO REPORT THAT 4270% OF THE

03:54:03.729 --> 03:54:05.464
DEATHS ARE PREVENTABLE WORK

03:54:05.531 --> 03:54:07.466
LARGELY PREVENTABLE AND LARGELY

03:54:07.533 --> 03:54:10.035
DUE TO PROVIDE A FACTORS -- SO

03:54:10.102 --> 03:54:12.104
THIS IS WHY IMPLICIT BIAS

03:54:12.171 --> 03:54:13.906
TRAINING IS NECESSARY MY

03:54:13.973 --> 03:54:16.041
RESEARCH ALSO INCLUDES A CROSS

03:54:16.108 --> 03:54:17.443
SECTIONAL SURVEY DISTRIBUTED TO

03:54:17.510 --> 03:54:18.878
A DIVERSE GROUP OF CHILDBEARING

03:54:18.944 --> 03:54:21.347
WOMEN TO CAPTURE THEIR LIVED

03:54:21.414 --> 03:54:23.482
EXPERIENCE AS A MATERNITY CARE.

03:54:23.549 --> 03:54:24.784
INCLUDING DISRESPECT

03:54:24.850 --> 03:54:26.218
DISCRIMINATION.

03:54:26.285 --> 03:54:28.554
AND PATIENT DESIGNED ITEMS

03:54:28.621 --> 03:54:30.923
MEASURED ALL SEVEN DIMENSIONS OF

03:54:30.990 --> 03:54:33.359
THE WHO TYPE W. H. O. TYPOLOGY

03:54:33.426 --> 03:54:34.693
FOR MISTREATMENT PRUNING VERBAL

03:54:34.760 --> 03:54:35.761
AND PHYSICAL ABUSE

03:54:35.828 --> 03:54:36.996
DISCRIMINATION.

03:54:37.062 --> 03:54:38.831
FAILURE TO MEET PROFESSIONAL

03:54:38.898 --> 03:54:39.865
STANDARDS OF CARE.

03:54:39.932 --> 03:54:42.234
POR REPORT BETWEEN WOMEN AND

03:54:42.301 --> 03:54:43.335
PROVIDERS.

03:54:43.402 --> 03:54:45.037
AND POOR CONDITIONS PREVENTED BY

03:54:45.104 --> 03:54:46.372
THE HEALTH SYSTEM.

03:54:46.439 --> 03:54:48.874
OUR ANALYSIS FOUND DIFFERENCE IN

03:54:48.941 --> 03:54:50.309
MISTREATMENT BY RACE.

03:54:50.376 --> 03:54:52.211
SO STUDENT DEMOGRAPHICS AND

03:54:52.278 --> 03:54:55.314
CONTEXT OF CARE IN OUR SURVEY

03:54:55.381 --> 03:54:58.284
ONE IN SIX WOMEN SEVENTEEN POINT

03:54:58.350 --> 03:54:59.452
3% IN THE U. S..

03:54:59.518 --> 03:55:02.087
REPORTED EXPERIENCING ONE OR

03:55:02.154 --> 03:55:03.756
MORE TYPES OF MISTREATMENT SUCH

03:55:03.823 --> 03:55:05.591
AS BEING SHOUTED AT OR SCOLDED

03:55:05.658 --> 03:55:06.859
BY HEALTH CARE PROVIDER.

03:55:06.926 --> 03:55:08.828
BEING IGNORED REFUSE RECEIVING

03:55:08.894 --> 03:55:11.464
NO RESPONSE TO REQUEST OF HELP.

03:55:11.530 --> 03:55:12.798
AND OF COURSE RATES OF

03:55:12.865 --> 03:55:15.100
MISTREATMENT WERE HIGHER AMONG

03:55:15.167 --> 03:55:16.535
BLACK WOMEN.

03:55:16.602 --> 03:55:18.437
FOLLOWED BY INDIGENOUS LATINO

03:55:18.504 --> 03:55:19.605
AND ASIAN REYES.

03:55:19.672 --> 03:55:21.474
YOUNGER WOMEN HAVING THEIR FIRST

BABY LOW SOCIO ECONOMIC STATUS

03:55:24.243 --> 03:55:25.744
AND ELEVATED PREGNANCY AND

03:55:25.811 --> 03:55:27.046
SOCIAL RISK WERE ALSO RISK

03:55:27.112 --> 03:55:31.016
FACTORS FOR MISTREATMENT --

03:55:31.083 --> 03:55:33.285
ADDITIONALLY REGARDLESS OF THEIR

03:55:33.352 --> 03:55:34.587
OWN RACE.

03:55:34.653 --> 03:55:37.389
HAVING A PARTNER WHO WAS BLACK

03:55:37.456 --> 03:55:39.558
INCREASED A WOMAN'S RISK OF

03:55:39.625 --> 03:55:40.893
MISTREATMENT [inaudible]

03:55:40.960 --> 03:55:42.795
SO.

03:55:42.862 --> 03:55:44.630
WHAT DIDN'T INCREASE YOUR RISK

03:55:44.697 --> 03:55:45.998
WAS BEING WHITE?

03:55:46.065 --> 03:55:47.633
NOT HAVING YOUR FIRST CHILD AND

03:55:47.700 --> 03:55:48.901
BEING OLDER THAN.

03:55:48.968 --> 03:55:50.870
THIRTY OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT

03:55:50.936 --> 03:55:52.872
MISTREATMENT IS WIDESPREAD

03:55:52.938 --> 03:55:54.840
DURING CHILDBIRTH IN THE US AND

03:55:54.907 --> 03:55:56.408
MORE EXPERIENCED BY PEOPLE OF

03:55:56.475 --> 03:55:58.110
COLOR PARTICULARLY BLACK WOMEN.

03:55:58.177 --> 03:55:59.378
AND ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO FACE

03:55:59.445 --> 03:56:00.913
SOCIAL ECONOMIC OR HEALTH

03:56:00.980 --> 03:56:02.314
CHALLENGES.

03:56:02.381 --> 03:56:05.184
PROVIDERS MUST BE CHALLENGED TO

03:56:05.251 --> 03:56:07.620
CONFRONT THEIR BIAS AND NO WOMEN

03:56:07.686 --> 03:56:09.088
IN THIS COUNTRY NO ONE IN THE

03:56:09.154 --> 03:56:11.257
STATE SHOULD BE SUBJECTED TO

03:56:11.323 --> 03:56:12.992
MISTREATMENT AT THIS PRECIOUS

03:56:13.058 --> 03:56:14.193
AND VULNERABLE TIME.

03:56:14.260 --> 03:56:16.295
SO PLEASE WELL YES WITH SENATOR

CALIFORNIA HAS MADE GREAT

03:56:49.161 --> 03:56:50.462
STRIDES IN REDUCING MATERNAL

03:56:50.529 --> 03:56:52.498
MORTALITY HOWEVER BLACK WOMEN

03:56:52.565 --> 03:56:53.566
HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND.

03:56:53.632 --> 03:56:55.734
BLACK WOMEN ARE TWO HUNDRED AND

03:56:55.801 --> 03:56:57.603
43% MORE LIKELY TO DIE FROM

SERVING TWENTY SEVEN MILLION

04:16:13.791 --> 04:16:15.626
PEOPLE HAVE FOUGHT LONG AND HARD

04:16:15.693 --> 04:16:17.495
AND ADVOCATED FOR COVERAGE AND

04:16:17.562 --> 04:16:20.264
ACCESS FOR ALL.

04:16:20.331 --> 04:16:21.766
WE WERE TOP SUPPORTERS OF THE

04:16:21.833 --> 04:16:24.635
ACA AND KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE.

04:16:24.702 --> 04:16:25.870
THAT THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WAS

04:16:25.937 --> 04:16:27.004
A LYNCH PIN IN THIS HISTORIC

04:16:27.071 --> 04:16:29.273
LEGISLATION.

04:16:29.340 --> 04:16:31.109
LOSING THE TAX PENALTY WITH THE

04:16:31.175 --> 04:16:33.144
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IN A CA HAS

04:16:33.211 --> 04:16:34.245
MEANT THAT THE UNINSURED RATE

04:16:34.312 --> 04:16:35.913
HAS INCREASED.

04:16:35.980 --> 04:16:36.981
I'VE HEARD FROM MANY OF MY

04:16:37.048 --> 04:16:38.149
HEALTH CENTER COLLEAGUES THAT

04:16:38.216 --> 04:16:39.517
THERE AND ENSURE CREEK WAS

04:16:39.584 --> 04:16:41.986
AROUND 5% AFTER THE ACA.

04:16:42.053 --> 04:16:43.488
AND HAS NOW SIGNIFICANTLY

04:16:43.554 --> 04:16:46.724
CLIMBED UP ABOVE 15%.

04:16:46.791 --> 04:16:48.526
WE BELIEVE THIS IS TO THAT DUE

04:16:48.593 --> 04:16:50.161
TO THE ZEROING OUT OF THE TAX

04:16:50.228 --> 04:16:51.062
PENALTY.

04:16:51.129 --> 04:16:52.997
AT OUR HEALTH CENTER ALONE WE'VE

04:16:53.064 --> 04:16:55.133
SEEN A 6% INCREASE IN THE LAST

04:16:55.199 --> 04:16:58.069
SIX MONTHS.

04:16:58.136 --> 04:17:00.304
BOB THAT EQUALS ABOUT TWO

04:17:00.371 --> 04:17:00.872

04:17:08.846 --> 04:17:10.581
THE COSTS.

04:17:10.648 --> 04:17:11.582
BUT THE YOUNG AND HEALTHY IN OUR

04:17:11.649 --> 04:17:13.017

04:17:13.084 --> 04:17:15.052
BROADER POOL OF HEALTH INSURANCE

04:17:15.119 --> 04:17:17.021
AND THE MANDATE AS A CENTRAL.

04:17:17.088 --> 04:17:18.656
WHEN EVERYONE HAS COVERAGE WE

04:17:18.723 --> 04:17:20.091
