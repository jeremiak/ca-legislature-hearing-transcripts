OUT. FAIR TO SAY THAT THE C.

00:14:26.599 --> 00:14:29.235
ISSUE IS PROBABLY ONE OF A VERY

00:14:29.301 --> 00:14:31.337
SMALL NUMBER OF SYSTEMS THAT

00:14:31.403 --> 00:14:33.205
HAVE PUBLICLY DECLARED THE GOAL

00:14:33.272 --> 00:14:36.008
OF COMPLETELY CLOSE IN THE

00:14:36.075 --> 00:14:36.609
EQUITY GAP AND I THINK THAT'S

00:14:36.675 --> 00:14:38.477
COMMENDABLE. THE FIRST AREA

00:14:38.544 --> 00:14:40.379
THAT MUST FOCUS ON HOWEVER IS

00:14:40.446 --> 00:14:43.082
EXPANDING OUR CONCERTED EFFORT

00:14:43.148 --> 00:14:44.583
TO CLOSE EQUITY GAPS WE

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:46.252
CONTINUE TO IDENTIFY ACTIONS

00:14:46.318 --> 00:14:48.320
THAT ARE GOOD FOR ALL STUDENTS.

00:14:48.387 --> 00:14:49.555
YET THEY ALSO HAVE A

00:14:49.622 --> 00:14:51.090
DISPROPORTIONATELY POSITIVE

00:14:51.156 --> 00:14:53.592
IMPACT. ON OUR MOST UNDERSERVED

00:14:53.659 --> 00:14:56.862
POPULATIONS. THESE INCLUDE THE

00:14:56.929 --> 00:14:58.464
ADAPTING IN AN EXPANDING SOME

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.332
OF OUR BEST PRACTICES UTILIZED

00:15:00.399 --> 00:15:02.668
BY R. E. O. P. PROGRAMS SUCH AS

00:15:02.735 --> 00:15:04.436
ACTIVE ADVISING SUMMER BRIDGE

00:15:04.503 --> 00:15:06.972
STRUCTURE LEARNING SUPPORT AND

00:15:07.039 --> 00:15:08.340
COAL HOARDING STUDENTS TO

00:15:08.407 --> 00:15:09.842
INCREASE THEIR CHANCES OF BEING

00:15:09.908 --> 00:15:12.177
A RETAIN. IT ALSO INCLUDES A

00:15:12.244 --> 00:15:13.245
GREATER PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS

00:15:13.312 --> 00:15:14.647
EARNING THIRTY CREDITS IN THE

00:15:14.713 --> 00:15:16.048
FIRST YEAR AS WELL AS

00:15:16.115 --> 00:15:17.716
COMPLETING THE MAP THEM AND

00:15:17.783 --> 00:15:18.450
WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS

00:15:18.517 --> 00:15:20.286
REQUIREMENTS IN THEIR FIRST

00:15:20.352 --> 00:15:22.154
YEAR IS A CRITICAL MILESTONE.

00:15:22.221 --> 00:15:24.189
CLOSING THE EQUITY GAP ALSO

00:15:24.256 --> 00:15:26.425
MEANS MAKING SYSTEMIC CHANGES

00:15:26.492 --> 00:15:27.960
TO REDUCE BARRIERS FOR

00:15:28.027 --> 00:15:28.794
HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED

00:15:28.861 --> 00:15:31.130
STUDENT- AND NO STUDENTS FROM

00:15:31.196 --> 00:15:32.097
THOSE FROM UNDERSERVED

00:15:32.164 --> 00:15:34.266
COMMUNITIES. AS A RESULT OF THE

00:15:34.333 --> 00:15:36.101
EFFORTS THAT BEGAN OVER THE

00:15:36.168 --> 00:15:38.203
PAST SEVERAL YEARS. AS THEY

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:39.938
BECOME MORE INGRAINED ON OUR

00:15:40.005 --> 00:15:43.042
CAMPUSES WE FIRMLY ANTICIPATE

00:15:43.108 --> 00:15:43.942
THAT WE WILL SEE SIGNIFICANT

00:15:44.009 --> 00:15:46.912
ERROR IN. EQUITY GAPS THIS IS

00:15:46.979 --> 00:15:48.947
PARTICULARLY TRUE WHEN THE

00:15:49.014 --> 00:15:50.549
FIRST CORPS STUDENTS WHO

00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:52.051

TWENTY TWO. OUR SECOND AREA OF

TIME A STUDENT CROSSES THE

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.669
COMMENCEMENT STAGE. CAMPUSES

00:16:10.736 --> 00:16:12.338
ARE ALREADY IDENTIFIED WHAT

00:16:12.404 --> 00:16:14.306
WORKS FOR THEIR STUDENTS TO

00:16:14.373 --> 00:16:16.275
INSURE A CLEAR PATH TO DEGREE.

BE SUCCESSFUL. THESE THREE

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:58.143
AREAS- BUT I JUST HIGHLIGHTED

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:00.045
ARE IMPORTANT. THEY'RE NOT

00:18:00.112 --> 00:18:01.246
EXHAUSTIVE BUT THEY'RE

00:18:01.313 --> 00:18:03.148
IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE OUR

00:18:03.215 --> 00:18:04.883
GRADUATION RATE PROGRESS I

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:05.651
THINK WE HAVE SAID FROM THE

00:18:05.717 --> 00:18:07.719
BEGINNING THIS WILL LIKELY NOT

00:18:07.786 --> 00:18:10.656
BE A LINEAR PROCESS BUT WE HAVE

00:18:10.722 --> 00:18:11.957
TO SUSTAIN MOMENTUM IF WE'RE

00:18:12.024 --> 00:18:13.459
GOING TO CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE

00:18:13.525 --> 00:18:15.461

00:18:17.429 --> 00:18:19.731
IN MANY RESPECTS. INCREASING

00:18:19.798 --> 00:18:21.767
GRADUATION RATE DOES MEAN MORE

00:18:21.834 --> 00:18:23.435
STUDENTS TAKEN THIRTY UNITS PER

00:18:23.502 --> 00:18:26.505
YEAR. AND TO ACCOMPLISH THIS WE

00:18:26.572 --> 00:18:28.440
MUST HAVE MORE CLASSES AND MORE

00:18:28.507 --> 00:18:30.275
FACULTY TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS

00:18:30.342 --> 00:18:32.177
CAN A ROLL AND THE CLASSES THEY

00:18:32.244 --> 00:18:34.079
NEED WHEN THEY NEED THEM.

00:18:34.146 --> 00:18:35.881
CURRENTLY THE AVERAGE UNIT LOW

00:18:35.948 --> 00:18:37.416
FOR UNDERGRADUATES IS THIRTEEN

00:18:37.483 --> 00:18:39.918
POINT FOUR UNITS. TO INCREASE

00:18:39.985 --> 00:18:42.254
THIS AMOUNT TO FOURTEEN JUST TO

00:18:42.321 --> 00:18:43.889
GO FROM THIRTEEN POINT FOUR TO

00:18:43.956 --> 00:18:45.390

EFFECTIVE ACADEMIC COUNSELING

00:21:25.017 --> 00:21:26.318
AND PART OF IT MAY BE THE

00:21:26.385 --> 00:21:28.654
ELECTRONIC OPERATE. IN THAT YOU

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.489
REFERENCED IN YOUR PRESENTATION

00:21:30.555 --> 00:21:30.989
BUT THERE'S PROBABLY NO

00:21:31.056 --> 00:21:33.792
SUBSTITUTE. TO FACE TO FACE

00:21:33.859 --> 00:21:35.427
CONVERSATION WITH THE CANCER

00:21:35.494 --> 00:21:36.762
WHO KNOWS WHAT HE OR SHE IS

00:21:36.828 --> 00:21:39.164
DOING. YES THANK YOU SENATOR

00:21:39.231 --> 00:21:40.499
IT'S A GREAT QUESTION SO THE

00:21:40.565 --> 00:21:43.769
SHORT ANSWER HOWEVER IS NOW A

00:21:43.835 --> 00:21:45.537
WE ARE NOT ADEQUATELY FUNDED TO

00:21:45.604 --> 00:21:47.105
PROVIDE THE NUMBER OF ACADEMIC

00:21:47.172 --> 00:21:48.940
ADVISERS FOR OUR STUDENTS THERE

00:21:49.007 --> 00:21:50.575
IS AN INDUSTRY STANDARD WERE

00:21:50.642 --> 00:21:52.778
FAR FROM IT. I CAN TELL YOU

00:21:52.844 --> 00:21:54.146
THAT IS SOLD THE APPROACH HAS

00:21:54.212 --> 00:21:55.981
BEEN TO GO AS FAR AS WE CAN

00:21:56.048 --> 00:21:57.683
WITH HIRING INDIVIDUALS WE KNOW

00:21:57.749 --> 00:21:58.650
THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST

00:21:58.717 --> 00:22:00.085
EXPENSIVE THINGS WE DO IS A

00:22:00.152 --> 00:22:02.554
UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. BUT TO TRY

00:22:02.621 --> 00:22:06.024
TO AUGMENT THAT WITH- BETTER

00:22:06.091 --> 00:22:07.325
AND MORE EFFICIENT USE OF

00:22:07.392 --> 00:22:10.128
DIGITAL ADVISING TOOLS ARE WE

00:22:10.195 --> 00:22:11.096
KNOW THAT MOST OF OUR STUDENTS

00:22:11.163 --> 00:22:14.666
ARRIVE WITH THE SMART ONE AND

00:22:14.733 --> 00:22:19.905
SELL SOME OF THIS IS CAN WE-

00:22:19.971 --> 00:22:20.439
I'M BETTER MORE. BILL TO

00:22:20.505 --> 00:22:21.006
INFORMATION TO THE ABOUT THE

00:22:21.073 --> 00:22:21.573
CHOICES OF SCHEDULE. AND TO

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.508
BAIL THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN

00:22:23.575 --> 00:22:25.177
SO ONCE WE GIVE A STUDENT GREAT

00:22:25.243 --> 00:22:27.779
ADVICE ABOUT WHAT TO DO. SHE OR

00:22:27.846 --> 00:22:29.614
HE HAS TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY

00:22:29.681 --> 00:22:31.149
DO IT ON THE CAMPUS AND A GREAT

00:22:31.216 --> 00:22:32.484
EXAMPLE OF THIS MARRIAGE

00:22:32.551 --> 00:22:34.986
BETWEEN. BETTER AND MORE

00:22:35.053 --> 00:22:37.122
EFFECTIVE COUNSELING. AND

00:22:37.189 --> 00:22:38.290
ADDITIONAL COURSE SECTIONS AN

00:22:38.356 --> 00:22:40.025
ADDITIONAL FACULTY A FIRE AS A

00:22:40.092 --> 00:22:42.027
STUDENT I COULD POPULATE MY

00:22:42.094 --> 00:22:43.361
SCHEDULE. BUT IF THE COURSES

00:22:43.428 --> 00:22:44.896
ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO ME WHEN I

00:22:44.963 --> 00:22:47.365
NEED THEM- DOESN'T MATTER HOW

00:22:47.432 --> 00:22:49.634
GOOD THE OR THE QUALITY OF THE

00:22:49.701 --> 00:22:51.837
ADVICE IS THAT THE INSTITUTION

00:22:51.903 --> 00:22:53.839
HAS TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE

00:22:53.905 --> 00:22:56.007
STUDENTS. ACCORDING TO THEIR

00:22:56.074 --> 00:22:57.843
NEEDS SO. WE ALL WORKED OUT THE

00:22:57.909 --> 00:22:59.478
NUMBER- MAY OF OUR QUE AS HAVE

00:22:59.544 --> 00:23:01.747
USED A PORTION. GRADUATION

00:23:01.813 --> 00:23:02.414
INITIATIVE FAR HIGHER

00:23:02.481 --> 00:23:04.449
ADDITIONAL ACADEMIC COUNSELORS-

00:23:04.516 --> 00:23:06.651
AND AMPUS PRESIDENTS HAVE MADE

00:23:06.718 --> 00:23:08.520
THOSE DECIIONS AND THAT AMOUNT

00:23:08.587 --> 00:23:11.323
VARIES ACROSS THE CAMPUS. BUT I

00:23:11.389 --> 00:23:14.459
THINK IT IS A VERY WELL KNOWN

00:23:14.526 --> 00:23:16.762
FACT. THAT NUMBER AND RATIO. OF

00:23:16.828 --> 00:23:18.864
COUNSEL TO STUDENTS THIS SIMPLY

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:20.766
NOT ADEQUATE. WELL I WANT TO

00:23:20.832 --> 00:23:22.768
RESPECT THE BCP PROCESS AND THE

00:23:22.834 --> 00:23:24.803
RELATIONSHIP THAT WE HAVE ON

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:26.271
THIS FLOOR IN THE FLOORS ABOVE

00:23:26.338 --> 00:23:28.240
US WITH THE FIRST FLOOR. BUT I

00:23:28.306 --> 00:23:30.175
WILL BE ASKING THE QUESTION IN

00:23:30.242 --> 00:23:32.410
A COUPLE WEEKS. TO WHAT EXACTLY

00:23:32.477 --> 00:23:35.147
WE WOULD DO IS A LEGISLATURE.

00:23:35.213 --> 00:23:37.249
VIS A VIS THE C. ISSUE ISTOM.

00:23:37.315 --> 00:23:40.085
TO ADEQUATELY FUND AT ACADEMIC

00:23:40.152 --> 00:23:42.187
COUNSELING ACROSS THE BOARD SO

00:23:42.254 --> 00:23:42.821
THAT STUDENTS WHO NEED

00:23:42.888 --> 00:23:44.156
COUNSELING HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY

00:23:44.222 --> 00:23:45.957
TO GET IT. AND GET IT WITHIN A

00:23:46.024 --> 00:23:47.058
REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME

00:23:47.125 --> 00:23:49.461
BECAUSE IT OCCURS TO ME.

00:23:49.528 --> 00:23:50.562
ALTHOUGH I'M DECADES AND

00:23:50.629 --> 00:23:52.130
DECADES REMOVED FROM THE

00:23:52.197 --> 00:23:54.132
ACADEMIC SETTING. THAT IF A

00:23:54.199 --> 00:23:56.034
STUDENT MAKES A MISTAKE.

00:23:56.101 --> 00:23:58.036
BECAUSE A STUDENT CAN ACCESS A

00:23:58.103 --> 00:23:59.371
COUNSELOR OR OF THE CANCER

00:23:59.437 --> 00:24:01.139
MAKES A MISTAKE BECAUSE THE

00:24:01.206 --> 00:24:02.741
CANCER DOESN'T KNOW NECESSARILY

00:24:02.808 --> 00:24:04.910
BUT HERE SHE HAPPENS TO BE

00:24:04.976 --> 00:24:06.011
DOING IN THAT AND A PARTICULAR

00:24:06.077 --> 00:24:08.613

FOUR SEMESTERS. OF A STUDENT'S

00:24:14.085 --> 00:24:16.021
PRESENCE ON CAMPUS WHEN THE

00:24:16.087 --> 00:24:17.489
STUDENT MIGHT NEST MIGHT

00:24:17.556 --> 00:24:19.758
OTHERWISE BE ABLE TO GRADUATE

00:24:19.825 --> 00:24:22.928
EIGHT. FREE UP SEAT FOR ELSE SO

GET WINTER. WITH FIRST FOR NBC

00:24:27.132 --> 00:24:29.067
PROCESS BUT IT WILL BE A

00:24:29.134 --> 00:24:30.368
LEGISLATIVE QUESTION AND THE

00:24:30.435 --> 00:24:31.403
QUESTION OF BRITAIN'S WOULD

00:24:31.469 --> 00:24:33.305

VERY COMPREHENSIVE REPORT. MY

00:24:43.949 --> 00:24:45.851
QUESTION IS ALSO FINANCIAL IN

00:24:45.917 --> 00:24:50.655
NATURE. IF WE ONLY INCREASED

00:24:50.722 --> 00:24:51.289
FUNDING BY WHAT PERCENT I THINK

00:24:51.356 --> 00:24:56.161
THAT'S WHAT THE CHAIRS. BUT YOU

00:24:56.228 --> 00:24:56.795

I MEAN SERIOUSLY HOW DID YOU DO

00:24:59.731 --> 00:25:00.265
THAT WITH SUCH A SMALL AMOUNT

00:25:00.332 --> 00:25:02.567
OF MONEY. YEAH SO IT'S SO IT'S

00:25:02.634 --> 00:25:04.135
A GREAT QUESTION I WILL TELL

00:25:04.202 --> 00:25:06.471
YOU THAT EVERY INTERVENTION

00:25:06.538 --> 00:25:09.341
THAT WE HAVE. EMPLOYED OVER THE

00:25:09.407 --> 00:25:11.610
LAST THREE YEARS NOT ALL OF

00:25:11.676 --> 00:25:13.845
THEM WERE COST INTENSIVE. SOL

00:25:13.912 --> 00:25:15.046
IT JUST JUST FOR A POINT OF

00:25:15.113 --> 00:25:16.548
REFERENCE SENATOR WHEN WE BEGAN

00:25:16.615 --> 00:25:17.782
THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE AND

00:25:17.849 --> 00:25:20.118
WE WERE ATTEMPTING TO IDENTIFY

00:25:20.185 --> 00:25:21.353
APPROPRIATE TARGETS FOR THE

00:25:21.419 --> 00:25:23.088
SYSTEM. AND FOR EACH OF OUR

00:25:23.154 --> 00:25:26.224
INSTITUTIONS- WE BEGAN WHAT

00:25:26.291 --> 00:25:28.460
PEER INSTITUTIONS. WE CAN

00:25:28.526 --> 00:25:30.328
COMPARE YOU KNOW HARVARD AND

00:25:30.395 --> 00:25:31.997
STANFORD A YEAR WE WENT TO FIND

00:25:32.063 --> 00:25:33.598
A REGIONAL PUBLIC FOUR YEAR

00:25:33.665 --> 00:25:35.367
INSTITUTIONS THAT ROOM ROLLING

00:25:35.433 --> 00:25:37.335
SIMILAR STUDENTS TO TAR SEE

00:25:37.402 --> 00:25:39.771
ISSUE POPULATION. WE FOUND TWO

00:25:39.838 --> 00:25:42.774
THINGS ONE THAT- PER PUPIL

00:25:42.841 --> 00:25:45.911
SPENDING WAS WAS FAR DIFFERENT.

00:25:45.977 --> 00:25:47.412
BUT WE ALSO LEARNED THAT THERE

00:25:47.479 --> 00:25:48.313
WERE SOME STRUCTURAL

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:50.148
DIFFERENCES IN TERMS OF HOW ALL

00:25:50.215 --> 00:25:52.617
CAMPUSES WERE GOING ABOUT-

00:25:52.684 --> 00:25:54.219
ADVISING STUDENTS REGISTERING

00:25:54.286 --> 00:25:56.855
THEM FROM CLASSES SO I. I THINK

00:25:56.922 --> 00:26:00.425
WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE WE HAVE-

00:26:00.492 --> 00:26:02.894
WE HAVE IT WE HAVE OUT SIZE OR

00:26:02.961 --> 00:26:04.663
OUTPERFORM BASED ON THE

00:26:04.729 --> 00:26:07.165
INVESTMENT. BUT I THINK SOMEONE

00:26:07.232 --> 00:26:08.466
ARTICULATED THIS WAY THAT WE'VE

00:26:08.533 --> 00:26:09.968
PICKED ALL OF THE LOW HANGING

00:26:10.035 --> 00:26:11.703
FRUIT. AND THEN SOME OF THE

00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:13.104
THINGS THAT WILL REQUIRE MORE

00:26:13.171 --> 00:26:15.807
INTENSIVE INVESTMENT PEOPLE.

00:26:15.874 --> 00:26:17.542
ADDITIONAL COUNSELORS MENTAL

00:26:17.609 --> 00:26:19.210
HEALTH COUNSELORS ADDITIONAL

00:26:19.277 --> 00:26:22.180
FACULTY- ADDITIONS AND PHYSICAL

00:26:22.247 --> 00:26:23.348
SPACE TO OFFER ADDITIONAL

00:26:23.415 --> 00:26:26.518
COURSES THOSE ITEMS WILL BE.

00:26:26.584 --> 00:26:28.987
NOT ONLY ONGOING COST BUT ALSO

00:26:29.054 --> 00:26:31.056
MUCH MORE COST INTENSIVE. VERY

00:26:31.122 --> 00:26:32.691
GOOD THANK YOU AND WOULD YOU

00:26:32.757 --> 00:26:35.126
SAY THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT I

00:26:35.193 --> 00:26:36.795
KNOW ALL OF IT'S IMPORTANT BUT

00:26:36.861 --> 00:26:37.629
WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE MOST

00:26:37.696 --> 00:26:39.164
IMPORTANT THING WOULD BE TO

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:41.566
HIRE ADDITIONAL FACULTY SO THAT

00:26:41.633 --> 00:26:43.101
YOU CAN OPEN MORE CLASS

00:26:43.168 --> 00:26:44.536
SECTIONS. THAT BECAUSE THAT'S

00:26:44.602 --> 00:26:45.804
WHAT I HEAR FROM STUDENTS ALL

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:47.706
THE TIME IS THAT I CAN'T GET

00:26:47.772 --> 00:26:49.040
THE CLASS I NEED UNTIL NEXT

00:26:49.107 --> 00:26:50.175
SEMESTER OR THE FOLLOWING

00:26:50.241 --> 00:26:52.310
SEMESTER INTO RICHARD'S POINT

00:26:52.377 --> 00:26:54.412
THAT AND THEN IT KEEPS THEM IN

00:26:54.479 --> 00:26:56.915
SCHOOL LONGER AND IT DOESN'T

00:26:56.982 --> 00:26:57.816
FOR A SEAT FOR SOMEONE ELSE. SO

00:26:57.882 --> 00:26:59.818
I THINK THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES

00:26:59.884 --> 00:27:03.321
ONE OF QUALIFY MY YES IF I MAY.

00:27:03.388 --> 00:27:06.424
AND YOU KNOW MY PROFESSIONAL

00:27:06.491 --> 00:27:08.193
OPINION IS THAT YES THAT IS

00:27:08.259 --> 00:27:10.929
TRUE BUT BUT THE OTHER SIDE OF

00:27:10.996 --> 00:27:13.965
THAT EQUATION IS REALIZING A

00:27:14.032 --> 00:27:17.569
GREATER SENSE OF EFFICIENCY.

00:27:17.635 --> 00:27:19.971
AND HOW WE USE AND ACCESS THE

00:27:20.038 --> 00:27:21.139
AVAILABLE COURSES IN THE COURSE

00:27:21.206 --> 00:27:23.475
SCHEDULE. SO I THINK IT'S A

00:27:23.541 --> 00:27:25.310
COMBINATION OF BOTH YES WE NEED

00:27:25.377 --> 00:27:26.578
MORE VOLUME WE NEED MORE

00:27:26.644 --> 00:27:28.413
CAPACITY BUT I WILL SAY WE ALSO

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.148
HAVE TO INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY

00:27:30.215 --> 00:27:32.450
IN THAT INTERACTION BETWEEN OUR

00:27:32.517 --> 00:27:34.486
COURSE SCHEDULE AND THE CHOICES

00:27:34.552 --> 00:27:37.088
THAT STUDENTS MAKE THAT LEAD TO

00:27:37.155 --> 00:27:39.157
ACADEMIC PROGRESS. VERY GOOD

00:27:39.224 --> 00:27:39.958
THAT'S VERY HELPFUL THANK YOU

00:27:40.025 --> 00:27:44.329
MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU SENATOR-LEYVA- I WANNA HAD MENTIONED-

00:27:44.396 --> 00:27:45.230
ANOTHER CHART THIS IN YOUR

00:27:45.296 --> 00:27:46.865
INFORMATIONAL MATERIAL IT TALKS

00:27:46.931 --> 00:27:48.199
ABOUT HOW MANY UNITS STUDENTS

00:27:48.266 --> 00:27:51.469
ARE TAKING- AT THE CSU. AND

00:27:51.536 --> 00:27:52.771
COUPLE FACTOIDS THAT COME OUT

00:27:52.837 --> 00:27:55.807
OF THAT. PARTLY ANSWERS US IN

00:27:55.874 --> 00:27:58.009
EARLY THIS QUESTION BUT- IS

00:27:58.076 --> 00:27:59.577
THAT 87% THIS TO THAT THE CSU

00:27:59.644 --> 00:28:01.713
TO TAKE A FULL LOAD. OF UNITS

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:03.882
FOR MORE. I'D OBVIOUSLY EVERY

00:28:03.948 --> 00:28:05.316
STUDENT IS IN A UNIQUE

00:28:05.383 --> 00:28:06.684
CIRCUMSTANCE THEY COULD WORK

00:28:06.751 --> 00:28:07.952
OBLIGATIONS FAMILY OBLIGATIONS

00:28:08.019 --> 00:28:09.788
BUT- THE STUDENTS THAT ARE IN

00:28:09.854 --> 00:28:10.989
THE CSU FOR THE MOST PART ARE

00:28:11.056 --> 00:28:12.957
TRYING TO GET THROUGH. AS

00:28:13.024 --> 00:28:14.692
QUICKLY AS THEY CAN. AND THE

00:28:14.759 --> 00:28:17.529
BIGGEST PROGRESS POINT ON THIS

00:28:17.595 --> 00:28:18.063
BECAUSE THAT EIGHTY SEVEN

00:28:18.129 --> 00:28:20.265
PERCENT. I HAS INSISTED OVER

00:28:20.331 --> 00:28:22.100
THE LAST FIVE YEARS TAKING

00:28:22.167 --> 00:28:23.868
TWELVE ANSWER BUT THE CHANGES

00:38:05.082 --> 00:38:05.950
WE'VE TAKEN A BUNCH OF

00:38:06.017 --> 00:38:07.184

EXCITED ABOUT OUR PROGRESS- AND

00:38:15.493 --> 00:38:16.527
PAYING SPECIAL ATTENTION TO

00:38:16.594 --> 00:38:18.162
CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP IS

00:38:18.229 --> 00:38:19.997
A MORAL IMPERATIVE ON ALL OF

00:38:20.064 --> 00:38:21.465
OUR CAMPUSES. WE CLOSED OUR ARE

00:38:21.532 --> 00:38:24.135
UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY GAP-

00:38:24.201 --> 00:38:25.536
FOR THE SIX YEAR GRADUATION

00:38:25.603 --> 00:38:27.438
RATE AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN- THAT

00:38:27.505 --> 00:38:29.740
CLOSURE OPEN BACK UP AGAIN-

00:38:29.807 --> 00:38:31.242
LAST YEAR. AND WHEN WE LOOKED

00:38:31.308 --> 00:38:33.044
BACK. WE THINK IT WAS A COHORT

00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:34.879
OF STUDENTS THAT THAT WE GOT

00:38:34.945 --> 00:38:36.514

YEAR GRAD RATE. THAT CAME TO

00:38:38.115 --> 00:38:39.283
US- BEFORE WE STARTED OUR

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:40.751
GRADUATION INITIATIVE PLANS

00:38:40.818 --> 00:38:41.819
THAT WE LOST THEM BEFORE WE

00:38:41.886 --> 00:38:43.120
COULD EVER REALLY. INTERACT

00:38:43.187 --> 00:38:44.355
WITH THEM WITH OUR NEW SYSTEMS

00:38:44.422 --> 00:38:45.956
AND SO WE THINK WE'RE BACK ON

00:38:46.023 --> 00:38:47.058
TRACK AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO.

00:38:47.124 --> 00:38:49.226

BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL REALLY

00:39:01.338 --> 00:39:03.441
GOOD- IF WE LOOK AT FOR YOUR

00:39:03.507 --> 00:39:04.208

TRAJECTORIES EARLIER. I WANT TO

CONTRIBUTED TO THE FIFTEEN

00:44:22.426 --> 00:44:24.061
PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE.

00:44:24.128 --> 00:44:26.163
ACTIONS A SMALLISH CHANGING A

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:28.966
DEADLINE. OR AS SIGNIFICANT AS

00:44:29.033 --> 00:44:31.535
TRIPLING THE NUMBER OF ADVISERS

00:44:33.504 --> 00:44:35.906
RETENTION RATES A LITTLE BIT.

00:44:35.973 --> 00:44:38.008
EVERY DIVISION ON OUR CAMPUS IS

00:44:38.075 --> 00:44:39.410
ENGAGED IN THIS EFFORT AND THE

00:44:39.476 --> 00:44:40.677
STE AND STUDENT SUCCESS IS

00:44:40.744 --> 00:44:42.513
EMBEDDED IN OUR TRANSFORMATION

00:44:42.579 --> 00:44:44.848
TWENTY THIRTY STRATEGIC PLAN. I

00:44:44.915 --> 00:44:46.016
WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU

00:44:46.083 --> 00:44:47.818
SOME SPECIFIC STRATEGIES THAT

00:44:47.885 --> 00:44:49.420
HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO MORE THAN

00:44:49.486 --> 00:44:51.188
DOUBLING OUR FOUR YEAR

00:44:51.255 --> 00:44:52.389
GRADUATION RATE IN JUST FOUR

00:44:52.456 --> 00:44:54.725
YEARS. FIRST AND WE TALKED

00:44:54.792 --> 00:44:57.795
ABOUT THIS IT A LOT BUT- IT'S

00:44:57.861 --> 00:44:59.096
VERY VERY IMPORTANT WHICH IS

00:44:59.163 --> 00:45:00.030
INCREASING THE NUMBER OF

00:45:00.097 --> 00:45:02.266
STUDENTS TAKING A FULL LOAD OF

00:45:02.332 --> 00:45:03.734
FIFTEEN UNITS PER SEMESTER.

00:45:03.801 --> 00:45:06.670
SECOND INCREASING THE RATIO OF

00:45:06.737 --> 00:45:08.572
ADVISERS TO STUDENTS AND

00:45:08.639 --> 00:45:10.207
DEVELOPING ROBUST ELECTRONIC

00:45:10.274 --> 00:45:11.875
ADVISING TOOLS WHICH WAS ONE OF

00:45:11.942 --> 00:45:13.310
THE THINGS THAT SENATOR ROTH

00:45:13.377 --> 00:45:15.512
WAS INTERESTED IN. AND THE

00:45:15.579 --> 00:45:17.114
THIRD RETHINKING HOW WE DELIVER

00:45:17.181 --> 00:45:20.117
CURRICULUM. ONE OF THE

00:45:20.184 --> 00:45:21.752
BEHAVIORS THAT EXTENDS STUDENTS

00:45:21.819 --> 00:45:22.820
TIME TO COMPLETION OF THEIR

00:45:22.886 --> 00:45:24.388
DEGREES IS TAKING TOO FEW

00:45:24.455 --> 00:45:26.890
UNITS. IF A STUDENT PLANS TO

00:45:26.957 --> 00:45:28.692
COMPLETE A FOR A DEGREE IN FOUR

00:45:28.759 --> 00:45:30.928
YEARS SHE MUST EARN THIRTY

00:45:30.994 --> 00:45:33.063
UNITS PER YEAR. TYPICALLY THIS

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:34.698
IS DONE BY TAKING FIFTEEN UNITS

00:45:34.765 --> 00:45:36.467
EACH SEMESTER BUT IN FALL

00:45:36.533 --> 00:45:39.703
FIFTEEN. ONLY 19% OF OUR FIRST

00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:41.171
TIME FRESHMEN TOOK A FULL LOAD

00:45:41.238 --> 00:45:43.340
OF FIFTEEN UNITS. WE ARE

00:45:43.407 --> 00:45:44.374
DELIGHTED TO REPORT THAT FOR

00:45:44.441 --> 00:45:46.743
FALL TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THAT

00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:48.846
PROPORTION HAS INCREASED TO

00:45:48.912 --> 00:45:50.714
FIFTY FOUR PERCENT. A CLOSE TO

00:45:50.781 --> 00:45:53.917
THREE FOLD INCREASE. A STUDENT

00:45:53.984 --> 00:45:55.085
EARNING TWELVE UNITS EACH

00:45:55.152 --> 00:45:58.255
SEMESTER IS UP IS FULL TIME.

00:45:58.322 --> 00:45:59.656
FROM A FINANCIAL AID

00:45:59.723 --> 00:46:02.126
PERSPECTIVE BUT IS ON A PATH TO

00:46:02.192 --> 00:46:03.927
GRADUATE IN FIVE YEARS INSTEAD

00:46:03.994 --> 00:46:07.798
OF FOR. THAT EXTRA YEAR ADDS

00:46:07.865 --> 00:46:08.765
TWENTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN

00:46:08.832 --> 00:46:11.268
FEES AND LIVING EXPENSES NOT TO

00:46:11.335 --> 00:46:12.769
MENTION THE OPPORTUNITY COSTS

00:46:12.836 --> 00:46:14.838
ASSOCIATED WITH A DELAYED START

00:46:14.905 --> 00:46:17.474
TO ONE'S CAREER. INCREASING

00:46:17.541 --> 00:46:19.243
AVERAGE UNIT LOAD HAS BEEN A

00:46:19.309 --> 00:46:21.145
MAJOR CULTURE SHIFT FOR

00:46:21.211 --> 00:46:23.180
STUDENTS ADMINISTRATORS

00:46:23.247 --> 00:46:25.849
ADVISORS AND FACULTY REQUIRING

00:46:25.916 --> 00:46:27.451
CHANGES IN ATTITUDES AND

00:46:27.518 --> 00:46:29.219
BELIEFS AS WELL AS POLICIES AND

00:46:29.286 --> 00:46:30.787
PRACTICES THAT CREATE BARRIERS

ONLY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE.

00:57:54.971 --> 00:57:56.739
COMPARE THAT TO SACRAMENTO

00:57:56.806 --> 00:57:57.707
STATE WITH WHAT TWENTY HUNDRED

00:57:57.774 --> 00:57:58.942

PROGRAM IT'S A MASSIVE THAT'S A

00:58:00.910 --> 00:58:02.478

00:58:07.584 --> 00:58:08.918
THAT HAVE ALLOWED IT TO HAPPEN

00:58:08.985 --> 00:58:09.586
AND HOW WE HAVE TO KEEP IT

00:58:09.652 --> 00:58:11.721
GOING. IN REGARD TO OUR BUDGET-

00:58:11.788 --> 00:58:13.857
AS EVER AT AND OTHER THINGS

00:58:13.923 --> 00:58:15.825
BUT- CAN YOU SPEAK TO I KNOW

00:58:15.892 --> 00:58:17.227
THE COMMITMENT IN LEGISLATION

00:58:17.293 --> 00:58:19.863
WEST WAS AT SEVEN. FOR YOU KNOW

00:58:19.929 --> 00:58:20.930

NOT SEEING THAT THE DISSIPATION

00:58:23.733 --> 00:58:25.368
RATE AND SO MANY FIFTY TWO

AND AS YOU ALL THIS IS A

00:58:31.207 --> 00:58:32.375
CONVERSATION THAT WE HAVE BEEN

00:58:32.442 --> 00:58:38.314
HAVING SYSTEM WIDE. THERE THERE

00:58:38.381 --> 00:58:40.383
ARE FEW. VERY ASKING. ARE

00:58:40.450 --> 00:58:41.050
WORTHY OF SO DESCRIBE NOW

00:58:41.117 --> 00:58:43.286
CERTAINLY A- MY- TO. THAT SIX.

00:58:43.353 --> 00:58:44.654
BUT WHEN YOU'RE TODAY THAT IS

00:58:44.721 --> 00:58:46.122
BRANDING I THINK MANY OF OUR

00:58:46.189 --> 00:58:48.825
CAMPUSES HAD A WAR OR EXISTING

00:58:48.892 --> 00:58:50.426
PROGRAMS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN

00:58:50.493 --> 00:58:51.194
SIMILAR SERVE SIMILAR

00:58:51.261 --> 00:58:53.062
FUNCTIONS. PRIOR TO THE

00:58:53.129 --> 00:58:54.964
LEGISLATION AND YOUR NOW

00:58:55.031 --> 00:58:56.633
STARTING TO SEE SOME CAMPUSES

00:58:56.699 --> 00:58:58.534
MERCH PROGRAMS THAT MAY HAVE

00:58:58.601 --> 00:59:00.403
BEEN BRANDED DIFFERENTLY

00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:01.504
FIFTEEN TO FINISH. ALL THE

00:59:01.571 --> 00:59:04.107
WORSE CALIFORNIA PROMISE. LIKE

00:59:04.173 --> 00:59:05.875
BUT NOT BRANDED AS SUCH AND SO

00:59:05.942 --> 00:59:08.311
WEST CAMPUSES ARE. COUNTING THE

00:59:08.378 --> 00:59:09.345
NUMBER OF STUDENTS

00:59:09.412 --> 00:59:10.847
PARTICIPATING IN THIS PROGRAM

00:59:10.914 --> 00:59:12.148
OR THAT PROGRAM STUDENTS WHO

00:59:12.215 --> 00:59:14.250
MAY BE. EXPERIENCING THE

00:59:14.317 --> 00:59:16.352
BENEFITS OF A SIMILAR PROGRAM.

00:59:16.419 --> 00:59:18.621
MAY NOT BE REGISTERED OR ROLLED

00:59:18.688 --> 00:59:20.189
SO THAT THAT'S ONE ELEMENT THAT

00:59:20.256 --> 00:59:20.857
I THINK. IS WORTHY OF

00:59:20.924 --> 00:59:22.959
DISCUSSION THE OTHER IS SOME

00:59:23.026 --> 00:59:27.397
VARIATION AND CRITERIA. WHAT

00:59:27.463 --> 00:59:27.897
WE'RE LEARNING FROM OUR

00:59:27.964 --> 00:59:29.632
CAMPUSES THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS

00:59:29.699 --> 00:59:31.467
WHO WHEN PRESENTED WITH THE

00:59:31.534 --> 00:59:34.070
OPPORTUNITY- STEVE MENTIONED

00:59:34.137 --> 00:59:36.839
THE CULTURE CHANGES THAT ARE

00:59:36.906 --> 00:59:38.441
HAPPENING. NOT ONLY WITH THE

00:59:38.508 --> 00:59:40.209
FACULTY AND STAFF BUT ALSO WITH

00:59:40.276 --> 00:59:42.545
OUR STUDENTS IN TERMS OF WHAT

00:59:42.612 --> 00:59:45.515
KIND OF EXPECTATIONS- WE HAVE

00:59:45.581 --> 00:59:47.050
FOR THEM UPON ARRIVAL IS

00:59:47.116 --> 00:59:50.253
INTERESTING I THINK. ROUGHLY

00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:52.021
84% OF OUR STUDENTS. WHEN YOU

00:59:52.088 --> 00:59:53.189
ASK THEM HOW MANY EXPECT TO

00:59:53.256 --> 00:59:55.291
GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS ABOUT

00:59:55.358 --> 00:59:57.727
84% OF THE HANDS GO UP. IF YOU

00:59:57.794 --> 00:59:58.828
SAT AND SPOKE WITH THOSE

00:59:58.895 --> 00:59:59.796
STUDENTS ABOUT WHAT'S

00:59:59.862 --> 01:00:02.865
TECHNICALLY NECESSARY IN ORDER

01:00:02.932 --> 01:00:05.168
FOR THAT TO HAPPEN MANY OF- ARE

01:00:05.234 --> 01:00:06.536
SORT OF ON AWARE AND THAT

01:00:06.602 --> 01:00:08.471
DOESN'T EVEN ACCOUNT FOR. NOT

01:00:08.538 --> 01:00:09.939
BEING ABLE TO GET A COURSE IN A

01:00:10.006 --> 01:00:13.509
pIT- OR THE EXPECTATION THAT

01:00:13.576 --> 01:00:14.777
THEY'RE GOING TO BE ENROLLED IN

01:00:14.844 --> 01:00:16.679
MAKING SUCH A WHAT BUT MAY SEEM

01:00:16.746 --> 01:00:18.715
LIKE A SIGNIFICANT COMMITMENT

01:00:18.781 --> 01:00:20.183
IN THEIR FIRST YEAR. SO THERE'S

01:00:20.249 --> 01:00:23.286
JUST SOME- ENGAGEMENT THAT WE

01:00:23.353 --> 01:00:25.088
HAVE TO DO AND WITH RESPECT TO

01:00:25.154 --> 01:00:27.190
ADVISE AND IN A ROW TO STUDENTS

01:00:27.256 --> 01:00:29.359
IN THE PROGRAM. THE OTHER

01:00:29.425 --> 01:00:31.527
VARIABLE I WILL MENTION IS THE

01:00:31.594 --> 01:00:33.663
ABILITY OF STUDENTS WHO MAKE

01:00:33.730 --> 01:00:37.166
THE PLAY AT AGE. IN YEAR ONE OR

01:00:37.233 --> 01:00:40.837
TERM ONE. ROOM ON TRACK. AND

01:00:40.903 --> 01:00:41.904
THREE SEMESTER FOR SEMESTER

01:00:41.971 --> 01:00:44.374
FIVE. SO IN ANY GIVEN TERM

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:45.608
WE'RE WE'RE COUNTY HOW MANY

01:00:45.675 --> 01:00:47.443
STUDENTS ARE PARTICIPATING.

01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:49.078
THERE IS SOME ATTRITION THAT WE

01:00:49.145 --> 01:00:52.081
HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR- THE FINAL

01:00:52.148 --> 01:00:54.917
THING THAT I WILL MENTION AND I

01:00:54.984 --> 01:00:56.352
DON'T KNOW THAT THIS REPRESENTS

01:00:56.419 --> 01:00:58.521
AN ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM. IS

01:00:58.588 --> 01:01:00.056
THAT THE INSTITUTIONAL

01:01:00.123 --> 01:01:02.592
COMMITMENT TO FOR FIELD A

01:01:02.658 --> 01:01:04.761
PROMISE AND I AND I KNOW THAT

01:01:04.827 --> 01:01:05.828
THAT IS A DELICATE AND

01:01:05.895 --> 01:01:07.964
SENSITIVE ISSUE. BUT IT IS-

01:01:08.031 --> 01:01:10.366
VARIABLE AND IN TERMS OF HOW

01:01:10.433 --> 01:01:12.468
YOU SEE SOME VARIATION IN AND

01:01:12.535 --> 01:01:14.704
HOW STUDENTS ARE PARTICIPATING.

01:01:14.771 --> 01:01:16.105
AND I THINK I'D LIKE TO DRAFT

01:01:16.172 --> 01:01:17.874
ON THAT LAST POINT BECAUSE I

01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:20.576
RECOGNIZE. THAT THAT REALLY.

01:01:20.643 --> 01:01:22.278
THAT YEAH THERE'S A COMMITMENT

01:01:22.345 --> 01:01:23.846
ON- ON THE STUDENT'S PART WHEN

01:01:23.913 --> 01:01:25.148
THEY SAY I WANT TO GET OUT IN

01:01:25.214 --> 01:01:26.549
FOUR YEARS. AND I'M COMMITTING

01:01:26.616 --> 01:01:28.518
TO TRY TO TAKE THE UNIT COUNT

01:01:28.584 --> 01:01:29.552
TO GET OUT AND THAT'S A

01:01:29.619 --> 01:01:31.687
COMMITMENT. AND THE INSTITUTION

01:01:31.754 --> 01:01:34.891
SAYING OKAY WE'RE GONNA GET YOU

01:01:34.957 --> 01:01:35.491
MAKE SURE YOU'RE GONNA GET THE

01:01:35.558 --> 01:01:36.059
CLASSES YOU NEED AND YOU GET

01:01:36.125 --> 01:01:37.727
THE ADVISED. NEED I UNDERSTAND

01:01:37.794 --> 01:01:39.695
THAT THAT. STRONG INSTITUTION

01:01:39.762 --> 01:01:44.333
TO BE ABLE TO THAT COMMITMENT-

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:44.967
AB BUT THAT BUT YET THAT'S THAT

01:01:45.034 --> 01:01:47.136
WHAT. THAT'S WHAT WE NEED OUR

01:01:47.203 --> 01:01:49.672
CAMPUSES TO REALLY DO RIGHT AND

01:01:49.739 --> 01:01:50.907
IF THERE ARE ROADBLOCKS TO

01:01:50.973 --> 01:01:51.808
DOING THAT WE NEED TO

01:01:51.874 --> 01:01:53.576
UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE ARE I

01:01:53.643 --> 01:01:55.745
FIND INTERESTING- THE YOU KNOW

01:01:55.812 --> 01:01:57.880
THE COAL HEART STRATEGY WHERE

01:01:57.947 --> 01:01:58.981
ARE YOU WERE ALREADY SELECTING

01:01:59.048 --> 01:02:00.716
PRE SELECTING COURSES IF YOU

01:02:00.783 --> 01:02:02.318
SAY YOU WANT TO BE A MATH MAJOR

01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:03.519
OR HISTORY MAJOR. THE

01:02:03.586 --> 01:02:04.854
INSTITUTIONS IT'S SAYING WE'RE

01:02:04.921 --> 01:02:06.522
GOING TO DO IN A COLLECTION OF

01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:07.924
KIDS THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE THE

01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:09.459
SAME GOALS THAT HAVE AND WE'RE

01:02:09.525 --> 01:02:10.793
GONNA OUT IDENTIFIES COURSES

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:13.529
THEY KEEP TRACK I THINK THAT'S

01:02:13.596 --> 01:02:15.698
A BIG MODEL AN EXAMPLE. OF

01:02:15.765 --> 01:02:18.701
WHERE I'VE GOT TO COME A POINT

01:02:18.768 --> 01:02:19.936
OF VIEW OF MAKING SURE THE

01:02:20.002 --> 01:02:21.904
CLASSES ARE AVAILABLE BUT THAT

01:02:21.971 --> 01:02:24.574
THAT THAT INSTITUTIONAL HUG

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:25.141
ABOUT WE'RE GOING TO BE WITH

01:02:25.208 --> 01:02:27.643
YOU AND- ALONE- IS A VERY

01:02:27.710 --> 01:02:29.212
IMPRESSIVE- PATHWAY THAT I

01:02:29.278 --> 01:02:34.283
THINK I BUT IT SURE. AS WELL.

01:02:34.350 --> 01:02:34.917
BUT THE PRESSURE ON INSTITUTION

01:02:34.984 --> 01:02:36.586
TO MAKE THOSE CLASSES AVAILABLE

01:02:36.652 --> 01:02:38.621
IS A BIG DEAL AND I AM NOT WHEN

01:02:38.688 --> 01:02:40.890
I TALK TO STUDENTS- AND WE'VE

01:02:40.957 --> 01:02:42.492
BEEN ON A WHOLE BUNCH OF

01:02:42.558 --> 01:02:45.862
CAMPUSES IN THE LAST YEAR. DATE

01:02:45.928 --> 01:02:47.763
THEY'VE UNIVERSALLY TALK ABOUT

01:02:47.830 --> 01:02:49.198
THE AVAILABILITY CLASS I CAN

01:02:49.265 --> 01:02:51.300
GET MY CLASSES AND I KNOW

01:02:51.367 --> 01:02:53.202
SOMETIMES AND STUDENTS SAY THAT

01:02:53.269 --> 01:02:54.003
THEY JUST DON'T WANT TO GET UP

01:02:54.070 --> 01:02:56.105
EARLY AND I WANT TO GET ON THAT

01:02:56.172 --> 01:02:57.473
EIGHT AM CLASS I KNOW I

01:02:57.540 --> 01:03:00.576
REMEMBER. I REMEMBER I DID TAKE

01:03:00.643 --> 01:03:01.711
A FEW EIGHT AM CLASSES AND

01:03:01.777 --> 01:03:03.513
ABOUT SENATOR ALLEN HE SEES THE

LOOK AT THAT IT LOOK AT

01:03:21.464 --> 01:03:25.334
EASTBAY. AT A SITUATION WHERE

01:03:25.401 --> 01:03:25.968
THEY'VE ACTUALLY GONE BACKWARDS

01:03:26.035 --> 01:03:29.539
IN FIVE YEARS. AND THEY DON'T

01:03:29.605 --> 01:03:30.773
SEEM TO BE PROVIDING THE

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:31.974
PATHWAY AT LEAST THROUGH THE

01:03:32.041 --> 01:03:33.309
PROMISE PROGRAM MAYBE THERE'S

01:03:33.376 --> 01:03:34.377
ALTERNATIVES THAT THEY PROVIDED

01:03:34.443 --> 01:03:37.013
ON THEIR CAMPUSES BUT THOSE ARE

01:03:37.079 --> 01:03:38.314
THOSE ARE HARDER NUMBERS TO

01:03:38.381 --> 01:03:41.717
KIND OF UNDERSTAND- AND WE'RE

01:03:41.784 --> 01:03:43.319
WE'RE IN THE PROBLEM SOLVING

01:03:43.386 --> 01:03:44.220
MODE WE WANT TO HELP EVERY

STATE- WE WANT TO HELP YOU WE

01:03:50.826 --> 01:03:51.861
WOULD HAVE A MISSION. BUT

01:03:51.928 --> 01:03:53.863
SOMEBODY THIS IS THE WILL

01:03:53.930 --> 01:03:56.265
DURING TO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY

01:03:56.332 --> 01:03:58.768
THEY- YOU KNOW IT WHILE THE E.

01:03:58.834 --> 01:04:00.102
YOU'RE GIVING THEM SOME FREEDOM

01:04:00.169 --> 01:04:02.138
TO DO THINGS THEIR OWN WAY AND

01:04:02.205 --> 01:04:04.073
I APPRECIATE THAT. BUT BUT IT'S

01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:06.008
NOT HAPPENING AND- EAT IN SOME

01:04:06.075 --> 01:04:07.109
OF THESE CAMPUSES I THINK I

01:04:07.176 --> 01:04:10.713
TOLD YOU THE STORY- PUP MONA.

01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:12.348
WE SAT DOWN WITH THE STUDENTS

01:04:12.415 --> 01:04:14.951
AT POMONA. I ASKED HOW MANY OF

01:04:15.017 --> 01:04:16.252
THEM WERE AWARE OF A FOUR YEAR

01:04:16.319 --> 01:04:17.720
TRACK CALLED THE PROMISE

01:04:17.787 --> 01:04:19.322
PROGRAM CALLED FINISHING FOR

01:04:19.388 --> 01:04:21.557
WHATEVER YOU WANNA CALL IT. OF

01:04:21.624 --> 01:04:23.593
THOSE TWENTY FIVE STUDENT

01:04:23.659 --> 01:04:25.027
COUNCIL MEMBERS AROUND THAT IN

01:04:25.094 --> 01:04:25.861
THE ROOM. NOT A SINGLE PERSON

01:04:25.928 --> 01:04:27.730
IS THERE HAVE A THEY WERE EVEN

01:04:27.797 --> 01:04:28.998
A WHAT ARE. ABOUT FOUR YEAR

01:04:29.065 --> 01:04:30.399
PATHWAY THAT THEY COULD GET ON

01:04:30.466 --> 01:04:32.501
ON THAT CAMPUS. AND THAT'S NOT

01:04:32.568 --> 01:04:34.337
TO SAY THINGS ARE GOING PRETTY

01:04:34.403 --> 01:04:35.338
WELL AT THE MOMENT THEY ARE

01:04:35.404 --> 01:04:36.839
THERE SOME REAL PROGRESS POINTS

01:04:36.906 --> 01:04:38.174
MONA SO I DON'T WANT TO. THROW

01:04:38.241 --> 01:04:39.942
THEM UNDER THE BUS. BUT WE GO

01:04:40.009 --> 01:04:42.645
TO THE MINGUS HILLS SAME THING-

01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:44.413
AND SO THIS ISSUE OF AWARENESS

01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:46.082
IS A BIG DEAL YOU TALKED ABOUT

01:04:46.148 --> 01:04:47.416
THE WEBSITE YOU TALKED ABOUT

01:04:47.483 --> 01:04:49.986
THE COMMITMENT FROM THE CHASER

01:04:50.052 --> 01:04:51.287
WHICH WE APPRECIATE. TO MAKE

01:04:51.354 --> 01:04:52.054
SURE THAT THE AWAY. AT LEAST

01:04:52.121 --> 01:04:54.957
WITH. YOU KNOW SIGN IN PLACE IS

01:04:55.024 --> 01:04:55.925
A LITTLE BIT MORE PROMINENT

01:04:55.992 --> 01:04:57.927
BUT- WHAT CAN THE SYSTEM DO I

01:04:57.994 --> 01:04:59.428

WE DO MORE TO MAKE SURE THAT.

01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:12.475
WHILE THAT MAY FEEL THE

01:05:12.541 --> 01:05:14.443
PRESSURE OF WE GOT TO MAKE THE

01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:16.212
CLASSES AVAILABLE OF PEOPLE

IS WHAT THEY NEED TO. ALSO

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:26.455
PETER IT'S A IT'S A GREAT. WHAT

01:05:26.522 --> 01:05:28.658
THOSE ARE GREAT EXAND I WILL

01:05:28.724 --> 01:05:30.693
BE THE FIRST TO ACKNOWLEDGE

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:33.329
THIS SYSTEMATICALLY PROVIDING

01:05:33.396 --> 01:05:34.864
CRITICAL INFORMATION TO

01:05:34.930 --> 01:05:36.832
INCOMING STUDENTS IS A

01:05:36.899 --> 01:05:39.402
CHALLENGE AYE AYE I SAT DOWN

01:05:39.468 --> 01:05:41.237
WITH THE- A GROUP OF STUDENTS

01:05:41.304 --> 01:05:43.472
FOR DINNER- IT WHEN I WAS

01:05:43.539 --> 01:05:45.074
VISITING THE CAMPUS A FEW WEEKS

01:05:45.141 --> 01:05:46.509
AGO. AND ONE OF THE STUDENTS

01:05:46.575 --> 01:05:49.645
SAID TO ME HE- I THANK GOD I

01:05:49.712 --> 01:05:50.880
WAS ASKING ABOUT WERE IN TATIAN

01:05:50.946 --> 01:05:51.580
STUDENTS SAID TO ME WELL I

01:05:51.647 --> 01:05:53.549
DIDN'T GO TO ORIENTATION WHAT

01:05:53.616 --> 01:05:54.817
DO YOU MEETING GOING I DON'T

01:05:54.884 --> 01:05:57.486
KNOW ABOUT IT. SO IN MY MIND

01:05:57.553 --> 01:05:59.322
HOW DOES THE INCOMING STUDENTS

01:05:59.388 --> 01:06:01.991
NOT GET GOOD INFORMATION ABOUT

01:06:02.058 --> 01:06:03.993
SOMETHING AS CRITICAL AS

01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:05.828
ADVISING SO I KNOW THAT THAT

01:06:05.895 --> 01:06:06.462
HAPPENS NOT JUST PUT THIS

01:06:06.529 --> 01:06:08.331
PROGRAM THAT'S WHAT. OTHER

01:06:08.397 --> 01:06:11.267
AREAS WHERE STUDENTS ARE NOT

01:06:11.334 --> 01:06:14.603
RECEIVING CRITICAL INFORMATION.

01:06:14.670 --> 01:06:16.706
JUST ONE BIT FURTHER ON THIS.

01:06:16.772 --> 01:06:17.606
IS THAT A STUDENT SUCCESS

01:06:17.673 --> 01:06:19.108
SUMMIT ON ONE OF THE CAMPUSES

01:06:19.175 --> 01:06:20.309
AND THERE WAS THIS HUGE DEBATE

01:06:20.376 --> 01:06:22.278
ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

01:06:22.345 --> 01:06:25.181
EMAIL. AND THERE WAS A SORT OF

01:06:25.247 --> 01:06:26.482
ONGOING JOKE ABOUT THE

01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:28.050
PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS ACTUALLY

01:06:28.117 --> 01:06:30.419
READ EMAILS THAT COME FROM. THE

01:06:30.486 --> 01:06:31.554
INSTITUTION SO THERE WAS A REAL

01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:33.122
ALL CONVERSATION ABOUT

01:06:33.189 --> 01:06:34.824
ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF

01:06:34.890 --> 01:06:36.992
TRANSMITTING CRITICAL IMPORTANT

01:06:37.059 --> 01:06:38.961
INFORMATION TO STUDENTS. SO I

01:06:39.028 --> 01:06:40.596
THINK YOU KNOW THAT IS A BIG

01:06:40.663 --> 01:06:41.997
PART OF OUR STRATEGY YOU HEARD

01:06:42.064 --> 01:06:43.966
ME MENTION EARLIER. THAT THIS

01:06:44.033 --> 01:06:46.135
WILL NOW BECOME A FEATURE ON

01:06:46.202 --> 01:06:48.371
CAL STATE APPLY. I SAW THE

01:06:48.437 --> 01:06:49.271
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

01:06:49.338 --> 01:06:51.474
APPLICANTS EACH YEAR THAT ARE

01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:53.809
GOING TO THAT WEBSITE- THE

01:06:53.876 --> 01:06:55.010
CALIFORNIA PROMISE WILL BE

01:06:55.077 --> 01:06:56.979
FEATURED THERE AND A TAB WITH

01:06:57.046 --> 01:06:59.215
INFORMATION AND AN OPPORTUNITY

01:06:59.281 --> 01:07:01.050
FOR THEM.TO FIND ADDITIONAL

01:07:01.117 --> 01:07:02.651
INFORMATION ON THEIR CAMPUS AND

01:07:02.718 --> 01:07:03.419
I THINK THAT WILL GO A LONG

01:07:03.486 --> 01:07:05.988
WAY. ARE THE OTHER IS THAT I

01:07:06.055 --> 01:07:10.159
THINK YOU CONTINUING TO PUSH US

01:07:10.226 --> 01:07:12.695
ON THIS ISSUE. HAS FOR SOME

01:07:12.762 --> 01:07:13.963
ACTION AS I MENTIONED THE

01:07:14.029 --> 01:07:16.098
CHANCELLOR'S NOW COMMUNICATING

01:07:16.165 --> 01:07:17.466
WITH CAMPUS PRESIDENT. THERE

01:07:17.533 --> 01:07:18.334
ARE A HANDFUL OF OTHER KERN

01:07:18.401 --> 01:07:19.435
COMMUNICATIONS THAT HAVE GONE

01:07:19.502 --> 01:07:22.037
TO OUR CAMPUS LEADERS ABOUT HOW

01:07:22.104 --> 01:07:23.139
TO MORE PROMINENTLY FEATURED

01:07:23.205 --> 01:07:24.673
THIS PROGRAM SO. ARE WE HAVE

01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:26.809
MADE A COMMITMENT TO THIS AND I

01:07:26.876 --> 01:07:28.711
EXPECT THAT YOU WILL SEE

01:07:28.778 --> 01:07:31.313
IMPROVEMENTS ACROSS THE BOARD

01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:35.017
WE GOT FOR. I STORY IN A LOT

01:07:35.084 --> 01:07:36.118
ANGELES TIMES A FEW DAYS AGO

01:07:36.185 --> 01:07:38.220
TOP. THE CAST LA WAS DOING WITH

01:07:38.287 --> 01:07:39.021
PARENTS BRING THEM AT THE RIGHT

01:07:39.088 --> 01:07:40.956
TIME THE SEMESTER. IN THERE I

01:07:41.023 --> 01:07:41.924
BELIEVE IT WAS THEIR FRESHMAN

01:07:41.991 --> 01:07:44.059
YEAR TO MAKE SURE THAT- THEY

01:07:44.126 --> 01:07:46.796
KNEW- WHAT WAS GOING ON SO THEY

01:07:46.862 --> 01:07:47.630
COULD CONNECT BETTER WITH THEIR

01:07:47.696 --> 01:07:50.599
STUDENTS AND TO MONITOR AND I

01:07:50.666 --> 01:07:51.667
THOUGHT THAT WAS A REALLY

01:07:51.734 --> 01:07:53.569
POSITIVE THING TO DO YOU KNOW

01:07:53.636 --> 01:07:55.471
AGAIN ANOTHER EXAMPLE. CAL LOS

01:07:55.538 --> 01:07:57.807
ANGELES IS THE LOWEST

01:07:57.873 --> 01:07:59.108
GRADUATION RATES IN THE STATE

01:07:59.175 --> 01:08:00.810
AND THEY ARE NOT ONE OF THE FEW

01:08:00.876 --> 01:08:02.011
CAMPUSES THAT ARE NOT

01:08:02.077 --> 01:08:03.145
PARTICIPATING IN EITHER THE TWO

01:08:03.212 --> 01:08:05.281
YEAR. OR THE FORTY PLEDGE

01:08:05.347 --> 01:08:07.349
PROGRAM AND I APPRECIATED THAT

01:08:07.416 --> 01:08:08.717
STILL THEIR CHOICE BUT IT'S

01:08:08.784 --> 01:08:11.353
OKAY IF IT'S CHOI IF THEY'RE

01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:12.955
MAKING PROGRESS. BUT IF NOT

01:08:13.022 --> 01:08:13.489
MAKING PROGRESS A SERIOUS

01:08:13.556 --> 01:08:14.957
MATTER THAT'S THAT'S NOT JUST

01:08:15.024 --> 01:08:16.025
THEIR FAILURE THAT'S OUR

01:08:16.091 --> 01:08:17.593
FAILURE TO AND I THINK WE ALL

01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:20.062
FEEL THAT. WE ARE YOUR PARTNERS

01:08:20.129 --> 01:08:21.931
AND- I WAS GLAD THAT SENATOR

01:08:21.997 --> 01:08:23.265
ROTTEN CENTER LABOR WERE HERE

01:08:23.332 --> 01:08:25.201
EARLIER BECAUSE- THEY SAID ON

01:08:25.267 --> 01:08:26.101
THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE AND

01:08:26.168 --> 01:08:27.236
THEY'VE HEARD FROM ME AND THEY

01:08:27.303 --> 01:08:28.637

PRAISES BUDGET LAST YEAR WAS.

01:08:40.015 --> 01:08:40.950

THE CSU THAT WE'VE HAD IN A

01:08:42.551 --> 01:08:43.886

01:13:02.444 --> 01:13:04.847
A DRAMATIC CHANGE AND BUT AS I

01:13:04.913 --> 01:13:06.115
SAID WE CHANGE WE OPTED ABOUT

01:13:06.181 --> 01:13:07.716
IT SO THAT OUR COLLEGES AVE NO

01:13:07.783 --> 01:13:09.585
REASON NOT TO ADD CLASSES

01:13:09.651 --> 01:13:11.420
BECAUSE WE'RE PAYING FOR THEM

01:13:11.487 --> 01:13:11.920
CENTRAL OUT OF ACADEMIC

01:13:11.987 --> 01:13:14.123
AFFAIRS. AND SO THEY COULDN'T

01:13:14.189 --> 01:13:15.724
COULDN'T HAVE THAT TRADE OFF OF

01:13:15.791 --> 01:13:17.726
I DON'T OFFER THIS SECTION I

01:13:17.793 --> 01:13:19.228
CAN USE THE MONEY FOR SOMETHING

01:13:19.294 --> 01:13:22.965
ELSE THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF

01:13:23.031 --> 01:13:25.601
WE HAVE CHANGED THE WAY WE LOOK

01:13:25.667 --> 01:13:26.201
AT THINGS BUT WE ABOUT THINGS

01:13:26.268 --> 01:13:32.941
SOME OF WHAT. OUR FOR CULTURE.

01:13:33.008 --> 01:13:34.109
THE RESULT IS GREAT. WE HAD SO.

01:13:34.176 --> 01:13:34.877
FUNDING CUTS IN PEOPLE'S OF.

01:13:34.943 --> 01:13:37.312
RETREATED A SHELL AND IT TOOK.

01:13:37.379 --> 01:13:39.148
A DISRUPTION. TO BREAK US OUT

01:13:39.214 --> 01:13:40.749
OF THAT SHOW- AND ALLOW PEOPLE

01:13:40.816 --> 01:13:42.518
TO. TO DO IT EVERYBODY CAME TO

01:13:42.584 --> 01:13:44.253
THIS UNIVERSITY TO DO WHICH IS

01:13:44.319 --> 01:13:44.820
TO HELP OUR STUDENTS TO BE

01:13:44.887 --> 01:13:46.755
SUCCESSFUL NOW WE- NOW WE HAVE

01:13:46.822 --> 01:13:47.890
THE FREEDOM TO GO AHEAD AND DO

01:13:47.956 --> 01:13:49.291
THAT- BECAUSE THIS SUMMER

01:13:49.358 --> 01:13:50.959
MONEY. BECAUSE IT WELL IT WOULD

01:13:51.026 --> 01:13:52.528
BECAUSE WE'VE DEVOTED MONEY-

01:13:52.594 --> 01:13:53.862
WE'VE GOT WE'VE RECEIVED MORE

01:13:53.929 --> 01:13:55.831
MONEY- OTHER DIVISIONS WITHIN

01:13:55.898 --> 01:13:57.599
THE UNIVERSITY HAVE EITHER

01:13:57.666 --> 01:13:59.034
TAKEN CUTS ARE TAKEN SMALLER

01:13:59.101 --> 01:14:01.170
INCREASES- COMPARED ACADEMIC

01:14:01.236 --> 01:14:02.805
AFFAIRS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:14:02.871 --> 01:14:05.507
CAN- SUSTAIN. THE INSTITUTIONAL

01:14:05.574 --> 01:14:06.909
INSTRUCTION CAPACITY THAT WE'VE

01:14:06.975 --> 01:14:09.912
HAD WE'VE RECEIVED- MILLIONS

01:14:09.978 --> 01:14:11.446
AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A ONE

01:14:11.513 --> 01:14:14.116
TIME MONEY. FROM THE UNIVERSITYOUT OF PRESERVES TO MAKE SURE

01:14:14.183 --> 01:14:15.684
THAT WE CAN CONTINUE- THAT

01:14:15.751 --> 01:14:16.952
PROGRESS AND SO IT WAS A

01:14:17.019 --> 01:14:19.388
CONSCIOUS. TO DO IT DIFFERENTLY

01:14:19.454 --> 01:14:20.389
AND THEN THE ENHANCE IT JUST

01:14:20.455 --> 01:14:22.524
SLIGHTLY MORE- AT BECAUSE I HAD

01:14:22.591 --> 01:14:24.459
A FRONT ROW SEAT TO THIS THAT-

01:14:24.526 --> 01:14:27.629
WHEN. WE WERE AS A TRUSTEE AT

01:14:27.696 --> 01:14:30.766
THE TIME. WHEN WE WERE- HIRING

01:14:30.833 --> 01:14:31.366
AND USE THE UNIVERSITY

01:14:31.433 --> 01:14:32.367
PRESIDENT I CHAIR THAT

01:14:32.434 --> 01:14:34.970
COMMITTEE SACRAMENTO STATE. AND

01:14:35.037 --> 01:14:36.805
WAS CLEAR THAT 8% FOUR YEAR

01:14:36.872 --> 01:14:38.273
GRADUATION RATE WAS NO GOOD AND

01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:39.741
THAT WE'RE GONNA GET NEW

01:14:39.808 --> 01:14:41.510
LEADERSHIP ON THE CAMPUS. WE

01:14:41.577 --> 01:14:42.711
NEED LEADERSHIP THAT WOULD BE

01:14:42.778 --> 01:14:46.281
NEEDED- TO DOING BETTER AND SO

01:14:46.348 --> 01:14:48.584
WHEN PRESIDENT NELSON WAS

01:14:48.650 --> 01:14:53.455
HIRED. HE KNEW THE FIVE

01:14:53.522 --> 01:15:06.535
TRUSTEES AT. THAT THIS. AND I

01:15:06.602 --> 01:15:08.070
THINK IF HE WAS HERE AND HE HAS

01:15:08.136 --> 01:15:08.737
TESTIFIED IN THE PAST TO

01:15:08.804 --> 01:15:10.472
EXPLAIN THAT. THAT HE'S MADE

01:15:10.539 --> 01:15:11.874
SOME BUDGET DECISIONS THAT

01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:12.774
DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF

01:15:12.841 --> 01:15:14.376
BACKSTOPS. WHEN YOU USE

01:15:14.443 --> 01:15:16.311
RESERVES- EITHER YOU CAN'T GO

01:15:16.378 --> 01:15:16.979
AND SAY THEY'RE GOING TO

01:15:17.045 --> 01:15:19.748
REAPPEAR. IN THE NEXT YEAR. AND

01:15:19.815 --> 01:15:21.216
HE HAS MADE OTHER CHOICES OF

01:15:21.283 --> 01:15:23.385
REDUCING IN PLACES THAT CAN BE

01:15:23.452 --> 01:15:25.520
UNPOPULAR. ON CAMPUS BUT HE HAS

01:15:25.587 --> 01:15:26.722
OF THE EMBRACE THIS CULTURE

01:15:26.788 --> 01:15:28.390
CHANGE THAT YOU HAVE REFLECTED

01:15:28.457 --> 01:15:30.025
IN YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY.

01:15:30.092 --> 01:15:33.328
SENATOR ALLEN A FIVE IF I MAY I

01:15:33.395 --> 01:15:35.030
WANT TO JUST GIVE YOU A SYSTEM

01:15:35.097 --> 01:15:36.632
VIEW OF WHAT. SORT OF WHAT

01:15:36.698 --> 01:15:39.401
HAPPENED HERE. I THINK IN PART

01:15:39.468 --> 01:15:41.403
IN LARGE PART THIS IS AN

01:15:41.470 --> 01:15:43.639
EXTENSION OF WHAT. IN THIS

01:15:43.705 --> 01:15:44.907
HAPPENING NOW ACTUALLY IN IN

01:15:44.973 --> 01:15:47.342
TERMS OF- WHAT SOME OF TURNED.

01:15:47.409 --> 01:15:48.911
A NATIONAL WORK ON A HIGHER

01:15:48.977 --> 01:15:50.445
EDUCATION ACCOUNTABILITY

01:15:50.512 --> 01:15:52.247
MOVEMENT THERE TO THINGS THAT

01:15:52.314 --> 01:15:54.449
ARE HAPPENING SIMULTANEOUSLY.

01:15:54.516 --> 01:15:56.718
ONE IS THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING

01:15:56.785 --> 01:15:58.287
A NATIONAL DEGREE SHORTAGE AND

01:15:58.353 --> 01:15:59.521
IN TERMS OF THE CHANGES IN THE

01:15:59.588 --> 01:16:01.156
WORK FORCE. AND THE

01:16:01.223 --> 01:16:02.524
PRODUCTIVITY OF INDIVIDUALS

01:16:02.591 --> 01:16:03.926
WITH A BACHELOR'S DEGREE A

01:16:03.992 --> 01:16:05.827
NATIONALLY WAS A PROBLEM.

01:16:05.894 --> 01:16:07.596
PREVIOUSLY I THINK DECADES

01:16:07.663 --> 01:16:09.564
BEFORE THE QUESTION WAS ABOUT

01:16:09.631 --> 01:16:10.999
WHO GETS TO PARTICIPATE IN

01:16:11.066 --> 01:16:13.168
COLLEGE. AND WHAT THAT MEANS

01:16:13.235 --> 01:16:14.169
FOR INDIVIDUALS IN TERMS OF WHO

01:16:14.236 --> 01:16:15.170
GETS THE GIRL WHO GETS TO

01:16:15.237 --> 01:16:17.873
GRADUATE. THAT CONVERSATION

01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:19.942
SHIFTED TO HOW MANY DEGREE

01:16:20.008 --> 01:16:22.010
HOLDERS DO WE NEED TO PRODUCE

01:16:22.077 --> 01:16:23.612
NATIONALLY OR FOR THE STATE TO

01:16:23.679 --> 01:16:27.816
MAKE. THE DEVIL BACK TO BECOME

01:16:27.883 --> 01:16:30.052
THAT TURN A VERY SURE I AND TO

01:16:30.118 --> 01:16:31.687
ASK HOW PRODUCTIVE WHERE THEY

01:16:31.753 --> 01:16:34.222
WITH PUBLIC DOLLARS IN SOME

01:16:34.289 --> 01:16:36.425
CASES FEDERAL DOLLARS. IN THE

01:16:36.491 --> 01:16:38.460
STUDENT- FINANCIAL A PROGRAM SO

01:16:38.527 --> 01:16:40.128
THAT THAT WAS ONE VARIABLE IS

01:16:40.195 --> 01:16:41.029
THE SORT OF NATIONAL

01:16:41.096 --> 01:16:43.498
RECOGNITION THAT WE NEED TO BE

01:16:43.565 --> 01:16:45.801
MORE PRODUCTIVE AND PRODUCE

01:16:45.867 --> 01:16:47.336
SOME DEGREE HOLDERS. ON THE

01:16:47.402 --> 01:16:49.071
SECOND WAS THE ABOLITION A

01:16:49.137 --> 01:16:51.807
COMMON GOAL AND THE REALIZATION

01:16:51.873 --> 01:16:54.676
THAT SOME CAMPUSES WERE

01:16:54.743 --> 01:16:56.411
WOEFULLY UNDER PERFORMING AND I

01:16:56.478 --> 01:16:57.479
THINK THERE WAS A LOT OF

01:16:57.546 --> 01:16:59.748
SURPRISE SHOCK AND ALL WHEN WE

01:16:59.815 --> 01:17:01.984
STARTED ABOUT WHAT FOR YOUR

01:17:02.050 --> 01:17:05.454
GRADUATION RATES WORK WITH THE-SECURE. SHARON WHAT THESE WERE

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:06.755
BASED ON WHERE YOU GREW UP OR

01:17:06.822 --> 01:17:08.557
WHAT HIGH SCHOOL YOU ATTENDED.

01:17:08.623 --> 01:17:09.925
AND I THINK JUST BY SHEER AND

01:17:09.992 --> 01:17:10.692
SAW THAT FORCED THE

01:17:10.759 --> 01:17:12.194
CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT OUGHT

01:17:12.260 --> 01:17:14.896
TO BE WHAT'S A REASONABLE GOAL

01:17:14.963 --> 01:17:17.032
FOR OUR INSTITUTIONS IN TERMS

01:17:17.099 --> 01:17:18.700
OF GRADUATING A GREATER PERSON

01:17:18.767 --> 01:17:23.872
JUST IT RAW. AND ENOUGH AN OLD

01:17:23.939 --> 01:17:28.010
THING THING. A BLOOD DATA TO

01:17:28.076 --> 01:17:33.949
FRANCE. NO ARE CAN'T IS ONE OF

01:17:34.016 --> 01:17:36.118
TO BE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST.

01:17:36.184 --> 01:17:37.619
YOU WERE PRODUCED A ARMS OF

01:17:37.686 --> 01:17:39.454
NICE TO XIN PERFECT INSIDE. OUR

01:17:39.521 --> 01:17:40.288
ABILITY TO JIM CAREFULLY WITH

01:17:40.355 --> 01:17:41.023
SOME DEGREE OF SENT TO STAR TO

01:17:41.089 --> 01:17:42.824
SHOW. AND A MORE TRANCE WAY HOW

01:17:42.891 --> 01:17:44.459
CAN WERE PERFORMING IN VARIOUS

01:17:44.526 --> 01:17:47.229
ASPECTS REALLY GOT A LOT OF

01:17:47.295 --> 01:17:51.133
PEOPLE'S ATTENTION. I MEAN IT

01:17:51.199 --> 01:17:53.802
WHAT WAS I MEAN SURELY THE DATA

01:17:53.869 --> 01:17:56.004
EXISTED BEFORE. THERE WILL BY I

01:17:56.071 --> 01:17:57.272
MAY TRY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND

01:17:57.339 --> 01:17:59.307
INSTITUTIONAL CULTURAL SHIPS I

01:17:59.374 --> 01:18:00.642
SUPPOSE WHEN I'M ASKING THESE

01:18:00.709 --> 01:18:03.345
QUESTIONS- THE SHOCK AND I

01:18:03.412 --> 01:18:05.180
DIDN'T EXIST BACK IN. TWO

01:18:05.247 --> 01:18:07.149
THOUSAND AND TEN YOUR PEOPLE SO

01:18:07.215 --> 01:18:07.983
STRESSED OUT ABOUT THE

01:18:08.050 --> 01:18:09.317
RECESSION WAS THAT THAT WAS

01:18:09.384 --> 01:18:10.886
GOING ON THE THAT. THERE'S LESS

01:18:10.952 --> 01:18:11.953
OF A DEGREE SHORTAGE PROBLEM

01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:13.555
BECAUSE IT RELIES JOBS AND THE

01:18:13.622 --> 01:18:15.857
MONEY WAS BEING CUT SO THAT WAS

01:18:15.924 --> 01:18:16.425
TAKING ALL THE ENERGY OF THE

01:18:16.491 --> 01:18:18.727
ROOM. I HAVE WHAT THEY THERE'S

01:18:18.794 --> 01:18:20.695
ONE OTHER. ELEMENT AND I THINK

01:18:20.762 --> 01:18:22.464
IT SPEAKS TO THE CULTURE SHIFT

01:18:22.531 --> 01:18:25.367
I THINK. AND MAYBE A GENERATION

01:18:25.434 --> 01:18:27.702
AGO THAT IF A STUDENT. ARRIVED

01:18:27.769 --> 01:18:29.404
ON A COLLEGE CAMPUS AND FOR

01:18:29.471 --> 01:18:31.306
WHATEVER REASON A YEAR LATER

01:18:31.373 --> 01:18:34.076
WAS BACK AT HOME WORKING AND AT

01:18:34.142 --> 01:18:36.945
THE MALL- THE PERCEPTION WAS

01:18:37.012 --> 01:18:38.146
SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH THE

01:18:38.213 --> 01:18:39.614
YOU DIDN'T TRY HARD ENOUGH YOU

01:18:39.681 --> 01:18:44.086
WEREN'T MOTIVATED- AND I THINK.

01:18:44.152 --> 01:18:46.321
YOU KNOW INSTITUTIONS OF REALLY

01:18:46.388 --> 01:18:48.256
CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE A SIGN

01:18:48.323 --> 01:18:50.625
TRADITIONALLY THE BLAME FOR

01:18:50.692 --> 01:18:52.727
ATTRITION OR DROP OUT TO THE

01:18:52.794 --> 01:18:54.396
INDIVIDUAL STUDENT THAT'S RIGHT

01:18:54.463 --> 01:18:56.398
TODAY WE ARE ASKING WHAT

01:18:56.465 --> 01:18:58.066
HAPPENS IN THIS ENVIRONMENT

01:18:58.133 --> 01:18:59.734
WHEN A YOUNG STUDENT ARRIVES OR

01:18:59.801 --> 01:19:01.503
YOUNG PERSON ARRIVES. THAT MAY

01:19:01.570 --> 01:19:03.738
CONTRIBUTE TO WHETHER OR NOT

01:19:03.805 --> 01:19:05.440
THERE STUDENT PERSIST TO WORDS

01:19:05.507 --> 01:19:06.708
A DEGREE OR THAT BACK HOME

01:19:06.775 --> 01:19:08.443
WORKING AT THE MALL A YEAR

01:19:08.510 --> 01:19:10.312
LATER AND THAT HAS BEEN A BIG

01:19:10.378 --> 01:19:12.280
PART OF THE CULTURAL SHIFT. IS

01:19:12.347 --> 01:19:14.583
THAT THE ASSIGNMENT AND THE

01:19:14.649 --> 01:19:16.284
ATTRIBUTION OF WHAT HAPPENS TO

01:19:16.351 --> 01:19:17.919
STUDENTS HAS COMPLETELY CHANGED

01:19:17.986 --> 01:19:19.421
IN HIGHER EDUCATION AND

01:19:19.488 --> 01:19:20.322
COMPLETELY CHANGED IN THE C.

01:19:20.388 --> 01:19:22.290
ISSUE. AND THE MEDIA ENHANCE

01:19:22.357 --> 01:19:23.758
THAT BECAUSE I THINK DOCTOR

01:19:23.825 --> 01:19:25.360
MINERS REALLY HIT ON THE HEAD.

01:19:25.427 --> 01:19:27.395
EVERY TIME- THIS CONVERSATION

01:19:27.462 --> 01:19:31.733
CAME UP AND IN 200-011-2000

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:32.300
TWELVE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN

01:19:32.367 --> 01:19:33.502
THE ANSWER WAS WE HAVE

01:19:33.568 --> 01:19:34.769
DIFFERENT STUDENTS HERE AT THE

01:19:34.836 --> 01:19:37.439
CSU THAN IT YOU SEE. AND OUR

01:19:37.506 --> 01:19:39.641
STUDENTS CAN'T TAKE A LOAD THEY

01:19:39.708 --> 01:19:41.176
HAVE OTHER OBLIGATIONS AND THAT

01:19:41.243 --> 01:19:41.776
WAS THE NARRATIVE THAT'S WHY

01:19:41.843 --> 01:19:43.211
THE FOCUS IS ALWAYS ON THE SIX

01:19:43.278 --> 01:19:45.080
YEAR GRADUATION RATE WHICH AT

01:19:45.147 --> 01:19:47.115
THE TIME WAS UNDER FIFTY. BUT

01:19:47.182 --> 01:19:50.819
THAT'S WHAT THEY TAKE POINT TO

01:19:50.886 --> 01:19:51.386
AND SAY SEE WERE STILL DOING

01:19:51.453 --> 01:19:52.220
PRETTY WELL. YOU WILL WAS IT

01:19:52.287 --> 01:19:53.088
WAS THE STUDENTS NOT THE AND-

01:19:53.155 --> 01:19:54.656
WAS IN THE BARRIERS. AND THE

01:19:54.723 --> 01:19:56.191
SECOND PART OF THAT IS THAT.

01:19:56.258 --> 01:19:58.527
IT'S FROM A THIRTY THOUSAND

01:19:58.593 --> 01:20:00.829
FOOT LEVEL- FOR HIGHER

01:20:00.896 --> 01:20:02.330
EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA THE

01:20:02.397 --> 01:20:03.899
FOCUS FOR DECADES BECAUSE I GO

01:20:03.965 --> 01:20:07.335
BACK TO THE SEVENTIES AND BEING

01:20:07.402 --> 01:20:09.571
INVOLVED IN THE CSU. THE FOCUS.

01:20:09.638 --> 01:20:11.973
DECADES WAS. LAST ACCESS AND

01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:13.508
QUALITY. THOSE ARE THE

01:20:13.575 --> 01:20:15.677
STANDARDS THAT WERE EVALUATED

01:20:15.744 --> 01:20:17.045
BY THE STUDENTS BY THE FACULTY

01:20:17.112 --> 01:20:19.114
BY THE LEADERSHIP. HOW MUCH TO

01:20:19.181 --> 01:20:20.949
TUITION WAS OR NOT HOW

01:20:21.016 --> 01:20:22.817
ACCESSIBLE- STUDENTS SCHOOL

01:20:22.884 --> 01:20:24.286
ADMISSIONS COULD BE AND THAT

01:20:24.352 --> 01:20:25.854
WAS WE KEEP IN THE QUALITY AT A

01:20:25.921 --> 01:20:27.222
HIGH LEVEL. AND THOSE WERE THE

01:20:27.289 --> 01:20:29.391
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT- THE

01:20:29.457 --> 01:20:30.992
METRICS FOR SUCCESS IT WASN'T

01:20:31.059 --> 01:20:32.727
ABOUT STUDENT COMPLETION AND

01:20:32.794 --> 01:20:34.095
THAT'S THE NEW THING. AND THERE

01:20:34.162 --> 01:20:36.431
WAS A VIEW THAT THAT STUDENT

01:20:36.498 --> 01:20:37.165
POLLUTION REALLY WAS AN

01:20:37.232 --> 01:20:38.967
INSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATION. AND

01:20:39.034 --> 01:20:40.101
THAT'S WHERE WE TALK ABOUT

01:20:40.168 --> 01:20:42.003
CULTURE. THAT'S HOW THINGS IN

01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:44.606
MY VIEW EDGE AT SHIFT CHANGE

01:20:44.673 --> 01:20:46.775
THIS DOCTOR MINOR HAS INDICATED.

01:20:46.841 --> 01:20:49.511
YEAH YEAH THE I MEAN FOR ME I

01:20:49.578 --> 01:20:51.279
GUESS THE QUESTION IS SO VERY

01:20:51.346 --> 01:20:53.215
MUCH GREAT PROGRESS I MEAN WHAT

01:20:53.281 --> 01:20:54.749
ONE QUESTION I SUPPOSE I HAVE

01:20:54.816 --> 01:20:57.352
IS- WHAT PERCENTAGE OF YOUR

01:20:57.419 --> 01:20:59.988
STUDENTS. SHOW UP ON CAN'T

01:21:00.055 --> 01:21:01.256
EXPECTING TO GRADUATE IN FOUR

01:21:01.323 --> 01:21:02.991
YEARS WHEN YOU KNOW. THE DAY

01:21:03.058 --> 01:21:04.359
THEY FIRST AND ROLL THIS

01:21:04.426 --> 01:21:07.829
ROUGHLY 84% SYSTEM ONE YEAH. SO

01:21:07.896 --> 01:21:09.698
THEY'RE STILL IT YOU KNOW WE

01:21:09.764 --> 01:21:10.865
CELEBRATE ENORMOUS SUCCESS AND

01:21:10.932 --> 01:21:11.900
WE YOU KNOW WE WERE ABLE TO

01:21:11.967 --> 01:21:14.269
GET. SACRAMENTO FROM NINE TO

01:21:14.336 --> 01:21:16.004
TWENTY BUT- THE GAP BETWEEN

01:21:16.071 --> 01:21:17.105
EIGHT THIRTY HIM TWENTY SONORA

01:21:17.172 --> 01:21:20.675
MISS AND- SO THEY'RE STILL. AND

01:21:20.742 --> 01:21:21.309
MAYBE THAT'S A REASONABLE

01:21:21.376 --> 01:21:22.978
EXPECTATION I DON'T KNOW I MEAN

01:21:23.044 --> 01:21:25.780
I YOU KNOW BUT- NO I MEAN WE

01:21:25.847 --> 01:21:27.449
HAVE A LOT OF WORKS THE YET TO

01:21:27.515 --> 01:21:29.384

01:21:29.451 --> 01:21:30.952
WERE NEAR THE BOTTOM- WE WERE

01:21:31.019 --> 01:21:32.887
NOT PROUD TO BE. ON THERE- AND

01:21:32.954 --> 01:21:34.389
SO THERE WAS SOME TALK IN AWE.

01:21:34.456 --> 01:21:37.292
OF HOW WHAT ARE WE DOING- SELF

01:21:37.359 --> 01:21:39.728
