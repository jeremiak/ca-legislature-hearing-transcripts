STAKEHOLDERS IN THE SYSTEM.

00:24:05.644 --> 00:24:08.714 region:rollup2
WANNA MAKE A FEW COMMENTS ABOUT

00:24:07.212 --> 00:24:10.983 region:rollup2
THE ONGOING FIGHT THAT WE'VE

00:24:08.714 --> 00:24:13.252 region:rollup2
BEEN ENGAGED IN AGAINST WORKERS

COMPENSATION FRAUD.

00:24:13.252 --> 00:24:16.355 region:rollup2
THE FIGHT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR

00:24:14.653 --> 00:24:18.657 region:rollup2
MANY YEARS.

00:24:16.355 --> 00:24:20.159 region:rollup2
IT SEEMS ON ENDING.

00:24:18.657 --> 00:24:21.460 region:rollup2
AND THE BEST ESTIMATES BY

00:24:20.159 --> 00:24:22.861 region:rollup2
EXPERTS FOR THAT SOMEWHERE

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:24.797 region:rollup2
BETWEEN ONE AND THREE BILLION

00:24:22.861 --> 00:24:27.099 region:rollup2
DOLLARS ANNUALLY OR LOST TO

00:24:24.797 --> 00:24:28.467 region:rollup2
FRAUD.

00:24:27.099 --> 00:24:29.501 region:rollup2
AND MAKE NO MISTAKE THIS IS

00:24:28.467 --> 00:24:31.937 region:rollup2
MONEY DIRECTLY OUT OF THE

00:24:29.501 --> 00:24:33.505 region:rollup2
POCKETS OF INJURED WORKERS.

00:24:31.937 --> 00:24:34.940 region:rollup2

00:24:33.505 --> 00:24:37.042 region:rollup2
OF THE POCKETS OF THE EMPLOYERS

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:38.277 region:rollup2
IN THE STATE.

00:24:37.042 --> 00:24:39.278 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE REASONS I ASKED THE

00:24:38.277 --> 00:24:41.246 region:rollup2
STATE AUDITOR TO TAKE A LOOK AT

00:24:39.278 --> 00:24:42.514 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM.

00:24:41.246 --> 00:24:43.615 region:rollup2
WAS DUE TO THE SEEMINGLY

00:24:42.514 --> 00:24:45.851 region:rollup2
INTRACTABLE PRESENCE OF IS

00:24:43.615 --> 00:24:47.786 region:rollup2
USUALLY AN ACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF

00:24:45.851 --> 00:24:49.388 region:rollup2
ONGOING FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY.

00:24:47.786 --> 00:24:50.756 region:rollup2
AND.

00:24:49.388 --> 00:24:52.624 region:rollup2
AS WELL THE NUMBER OF PLAYERS IN

00:24:50.756 --> 00:24:55.060 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM.

00:24:52.624 --> 00:24:56.061 region:rollup2
MAKES IT MORE COMPLICATED.

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:57.563 region:rollup2
I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THIS

00:24:56.061 --> 00:24:58.664 region:rollup2

RESPONSIBILITY. OUR STATE LAW

00:28:12.357 --> 00:28:15.227 region:rollup2
REQUIRES THEM TO HAVE A SPECIAL

EFFORTS THAT WE THINK HINGED. ON

00:28:43.789 --> 00:28:46.158 region:rollup2
DUSTER RELATIONS IS TAKING THAT

00:28:48.594 --> 00:28:51.997 region:rollup2
ANALYTICS AND ACTUALLY IMPROVE

00:28:50.729 --> 00:28:53.599 region:rollup2

WILL BE TALKING ABOUT IS OUR

00:28:55.267 --> 00:28:59.271 region:rollup2
SUGGESTION THAT EXPLANATION OF

00:28:57.236 --> 00:29:00.739 region:rollup2
BENEFITS WOULD BE ANOTHER TOOL

00:28:59.271 --> 00:29:02.641 region:rollup2
THAT WE BELIEVE WOULD BE VERY

00:29:00.739 --> 00:29:04.109 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE IN COMBATING A WORKERS

00:29:02.641 --> 00:29:05.444 region:rollup2
COMPENSATION FRAUD IT USED IN

00:29:04.109 --> 00:29:06.979 region:rollup2
OTHER INDUSTRIES DISABILITY

00:29:05.444 --> 00:29:09.414 region:rollup2
INSURANCE. A CERTAINLY THE

00:29:06.979 --> 00:29:10.549 region:rollup2
PRIVATE SECTOR USES AS THEY

00:29:09.414 --> 00:29:12.050 region:rollup2
REFERTO AS HE'LL BE SO MISTER

00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:12.618 region:rollup2
CHILDREN WE TALKING ABOUT THAT A

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:14.519 region:rollup2
BIT SO THAT'S THE DETECTION

00:29:12.618 --> 00:29:16.255 region:rollup2
SIDE.

00:29:14.519 --> 00:29:17.723 region:rollup2
MISTER CARLSON WILL BE SPEAKING

00:29:16.255 --> 00:29:19.157 region:rollup2
ABOUT INVESTIGATION PROSECUTION

00:29:17.723 --> 00:29:20.626 region:rollup2
PRIMARILY THE WORK WE DID IN

00:29:19.157 --> 00:29:22.327 region:rollup2
THIS AREAS WITH THE DEPARTMENT

00:29:20.626 --> 00:29:24.296 region:rollup2
INSURANCE. AND LOOKING AT THEIR

00:29:22.327 --> 00:29:26.298 region:rollup2
EFFORTS IN AS TO INVESTIGATING

00:29:24.296 --> 00:29:27.766 region:rollup2
FRAUD. AND SOME OF THE ISSUES WE

00:29:26.298 --> 00:29:28.300 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED THAT I THINK YOU'LL

00:29:27.766 --> 00:29:30.902 region:rollup2
HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:32.104 region:rollup2
INSURANCE IS VACANCY RATES IN

00:29:30.902 --> 00:29:34.573 region:rollup2
THEIR AND THEIR.

00:29:32.104 --> 00:29:35.807 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATOR POSITIONS THEY'VE

00:29:34.573 --> 00:29:38.176 region:rollup2
TRIED TO ADDRESS THAT WITH SOME.

00:29:35.807 --> 00:29:39.878 region:rollup2
RESTRUCTURING OF THEIR SALARIES

00:29:38.176 --> 00:29:41.346 region:rollup2
ARE TRYING TO DEVELOP A STRONG

00:29:39.878 --> 00:29:42.648 region:rollup2
TO REACH RECRUITING STRATEGIES

00:29:41.346 --> 00:29:43.148 region:rollup2
LOOKING FOR RETIRED LAW

00:29:42.648 --> 00:29:45.150 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS TO

00:29:43.148 --> 00:29:46.885 region:rollup2
PERHAPS.

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:48.220 region:rollup2
COME ON WITH THE STATE A

00:29:46.885 --> 00:29:49.621 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING A RETENTION PLAN

00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:51.056 region:rollup2
ANOTHER SUGGESTION WE HAD SO

00:29:49.621 --> 00:29:54.559 region:rollup2
THEIR ISSUES RELATED TO STOPPING

00:29:51.056 --> 00:29:54.960 region:rollup2
THE RESOURCES TO GET OUT THERE

00:29:54.559 --> 00:29:55.460 region:rollup2
AND CONDUCT THESE

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:57.329 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIONS.

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:58.630 region:rollup2
TIED TO THAT IS THERE SPENDING

00:29:57.329 --> 00:30:00.165 region:rollup2
SO THEY DEPARTMENT INSURANCE

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:01.300 region:rollup2
RECEIVES A CERTAIN ALLOTMENT

00:30:00.165 --> 00:30:02.601 region:rollup2
EACH YEAR AND WHAT WE WERE

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:04.136 region:rollup2
FINDING IS THAT ALLOTMENT WAS

00:30:02.601 --> 00:30:06.071 region:rollup2
NOT BEING FULLY SPENT BECAUSE

00:30:04.136 --> 00:30:07.105 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE VACANCIES. SO THERE

00:30:06.071 --> 00:30:09.041 region:rollup2
CAN BE A DECISION MADE BY THE

00:30:07.105 --> 00:30:09.641 region:rollup2
FRAUD COMMISSION.

00:30:09.041 --> 00:30:12.611 region:rollup2
TO EITHER.

00:30:09.641 --> 00:30:15.013 region:rollup2
OFFSET FUTURE BY CHARGES TO

00:30:12.611 --> 00:30:16.448 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS FOR WORKERS COMP OR

00:30:15.013 --> 00:30:18.450 region:rollup2
YOU CAN GET THAT MONEY OUT TO

00:30:16.448 --> 00:30:20.018 region:rollup2
THE DA'S THE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS

00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:22.688 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF OUR ANALYSIS WE WERE

00:30:20.018 --> 00:30:24.356 region:rollup2
SUGGESTING THAT. IT MAY BE MORE

00:30:22.688 --> 00:30:26.158 region:rollup2
BENEFICIAL IN THE EVENT

00:30:24.356 --> 00:30:27.392 region:rollup2
INSURANCE HOUSE UNSPENT FUNDS

00:30:26.158 --> 00:30:28.960 region:rollup2
THAT THOSE FUNDS GO OUT TO THE

00:30:27.392 --> 00:30:30.395 region:rollup2
LOCAL D. A.'S WE DID SOME WORK

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:32.464 region:rollup2
AT THREE LOCAL DISTRICT

00:30:30.395 --> 00:30:33.865 region:rollup2
ATTORNEYS OFFICES. LOS ANGELES

ORANGE AND SAN DIEGO.

00:30:33.865 --> 00:30:37.102 region:rollup2
AND MISTER CARLSON WILL TALK A

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:39.004 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT AS WELL SO

00:30:37.102 --> 00:30:40.772 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE THE KEY ISSUES ARE SO

00:30:39.004 --> 00:30:41.940 region:rollup2
AT THIS POINT AMENDED OVER

00:30:40.772 --> 00:30:45.577 region:rollup2
MISTER CHILDREN HE CAN GET INTO

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:47.045 region:rollup2
MORE SPECIFICS ABOUT. DETECTION.

00:30:45.577 --> 00:30:47.713 region:rollup2
YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU.

00:30:47.045 --> 00:30:48.914 region:rollup2
GO AHEAD I.

00:30:47.713 --> 00:30:49.848 region:rollup2
GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN

00:30:48.914 --> 00:30:51.216 region:rollup2
AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY

00:30:49.848 --> 00:30:53.185 region:rollup2
NAME IS MIKE TILTON AS MISS

00:30:51.216 --> 00:30:53.719 region:rollup2
HOUSE AND I'M NOT A PRINCIPLE TO

00:30:53.185 --> 00:30:55.220 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S

00:30:53.719 --> 00:30:56.555 region:rollup2
OFFICE.

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:57.989 region:rollup2
SO IS MISS HELL INDICATED WE

00:30:56.555 --> 00:30:59.458 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED WEAKNESSES IN THE

00:30:57.989 --> 00:31:01.126 region:rollup2
PROCESSES OF THE CALIFORNIA

00:30:59.458 --> 00:31:01.626 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE TO

00:31:01.126 --> 00:31:04.096 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL

00:31:01.626 --> 00:31:05.564 region:rollup2
RELATIONS. AND INSURERS USE TO

00:31:04.096 --> 00:31:06.231 region:rollup2
DETECT WORKERS' COMPENSATION

00:31:05.564 --> 00:31:07.966 region:rollup2
FRAUD.

00:31:06.231 --> 00:31:09.701 region:rollup2
.

00:31:07.966 --> 00:31:11.269 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE STATE LAW REQUIRES

00:31:09.701 --> 00:31:13.205 region:rollup2
INSURERS TO INVESTIGATE

00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:14.940 region:rollup2
SUSPECTED FRAUD INCH REFERRED TO

00:31:13.205 --> 00:31:16.308 region:rollup2
CD AYE AND DISTRIBUTARIES

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:17.743 region:rollup2
OFFICES.

00:31:16.308 --> 00:31:20.979 region:rollup2
THOSE CLAIMS THAT SHOW

00:31:17.743 --> 00:31:21.880 region:rollup2
REASONABLE EVIDENCE OF FRAUD.

00:31:20.979 --> 00:31:23.915 region:rollup2
BUT WE FOUND THE INSURERS VERY

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:26.084 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE NUMBER OF

00:31:23.915 --> 00:31:27.519 region:rollup2
REFERRALS THAT THEY SUBMIT.

00:31:26.084 --> 00:31:28.954 region:rollup2
WE LOOK AT DATA FOR TWENTY ONE

00:31:27.519 --> 00:31:30.589 region:rollup2
INSURERS WHO EACH HAD MORE THAN

00:31:28.954 --> 00:31:32.324 region:rollup2
A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION

00:31:30.589 --> 00:31:32.824 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IN EARNED PREMIUMS. IN

00:31:32.324 --> 00:31:34.593 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND

00:31:32.824 --> 00:31:36.528 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN.

00:31:34.593 --> 00:31:38.397 region:rollup2
AND WE CALCULATED REFERRAL RATE

00:31:36.528 --> 00:31:39.831 region:rollup2
PER TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN

00:31:38.397 --> 00:31:41.166 region:rollup2
EARNED PREMIUMS.

00:31:39.831 --> 00:31:42.768 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE FOUND FOR THE TWO

00:31:41.166 --> 00:31:44.436 region:rollup2
YEARS THAT WE EXAMINED IS THAT

00:31:42.768 --> 00:31:46.838 region:rollup2
FRAUD REFERRAL RATES REALLY

00:31:44.436 --> 00:31:48.940 region:rollup2
RANGE FROM ZERO REFERRALS TO

00:31:46.838 --> 00:31:50.842 region:rollup2
ELEVEN REFERRALS PER TEN MILLION

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:52.344 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IN EARNED PREMIUM.

00:31:50.842 --> 00:31:54.312 region:rollup2
AND EIGHT OF THE TWENTY ONE

00:31:52.344 --> 00:31:56.081 region:rollup2
INSURERS HAD RATES OF ONE

00:31:54.312 --> 00:31:57.315 region:rollup2
REFERRAL OR LESS FOR AT LEAST

00:31:56.081 --> 00:31:58.817 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE TWO YEARS THAT WE

00:31:57.315 --> 00:32:00.752 region:rollup2
EXAMINED.

00:31:58.817 --> 00:32:01.620 region:rollup2
AND TO THE INSURER SUBMITTED NO

00:32:00.752 --> 00:32:03.889 region:rollup2
REFERRALS AT ALL FOR ONE OF THE

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:04.956 region:rollup2
YEARS.

00:32:03.889 --> 00:32:06.358 region:rollup2
THOSE EIGHT INSURERS

00:32:04.956 --> 00:32:08.193 region:rollup2
COLLECTIVELY HAD ALMOST FOUR

00:32:06.358 --> 00:32:10.662 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS IN EARNED

00:32:08.193 --> 00:32:12.164 region:rollup2
PREMIUMS IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN

00:32:10.662 --> 00:32:13.498 region:rollup2
WHICH REPRESENTS THIRTY ONE

00:32:12.164 --> 00:32:15.267 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF WORKERS COMPENSATION

00:32:13.498 --> 00:32:17.202 region:rollup2
PREMIUMS IN ALL OF CALIFORNIA.

00:32:15.267 --> 00:32:18.837 region:rollup2
AND.

00:32:17.202 --> 00:32:20.071 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THAT WHEN ENSURE WITH

00:32:18.837 --> 00:32:22.073 region:rollup2
OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION

00:32:20.071 --> 00:32:24.042 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IN EARNED PREMIUMS

00:32:22.073 --> 00:32:26.178 region:rollup2
SUBMITS FEW OR NO FRAUD

00:32:24.042 --> 00:32:28.213 region:rollup2
REFERRALS IN A YEAR WE THINK

00:32:26.178 --> 00:32:29.748 region:rollup2
THAT SHOULD AT LEAST PROMPT CD I

00:32:28.213 --> 00:32:32.384 region:rollup2
TO MAKE AN INQUIRY.

00:32:29.748 --> 00:32:34.953 region:rollup2
BUT ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THESE

00:32:32.384 --> 00:32:36.254 region:rollup2
ENSURE REFERRALS ARE THE PRIMARY

00:32:34.953 --> 00:32:38.757 region:rollup2
METHOD THE STATE USES TO

00:32:36.254 --> 00:32:40.492 region:rollup2
INITIATE INVESTIGATIONS. INTO

00:32:38.757 --> 00:32:42.093 region:rollup2
SUSPECTED FRAUDULENT WORKERS

00:32:40.492 --> 00:32:42.627 region:rollup2
COMPENSATION CLAIMS

00:32:42.093 --> 00:32:44.362 region:rollup2
HOWEVER AT THE TIME OF OUR

00:32:42.627 --> 00:32:46.565 region:rollup2
AUDIT.

00:32:44.362 --> 00:32:49.201 region:rollup2
CD I DID NOT SURE THAT SELECTED

00:32:46.565 --> 00:32:51.069 region:rollup2
LARGE INSURERS WITH LOW REFERRAL

00:32:49.201 --> 00:32:52.037 region:rollup2
RATES WHEN PLANNING ITS AUDITS

00:32:51.069 --> 00:32:54.039 region:rollup2
OF THE SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE

00:32:52.037 --> 00:32:56.842 region:rollup2
UNITS.

00:32:54.039 --> 00:32:57.809 region:rollup2
SO TO REDUCE INSURERS POTENTIAL

00:32:56.842 --> 00:32:59.344 region:rollup2
UNDER REPORTING OF WORKERS

00:32:57.809 --> 00:33:00.812 region:rollup2
COMPENSATION FRAUD WE HAD A

00:32:59.344 --> 00:33:02.314 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF RECOMMENDATIONS.

00:33:00.812 --> 00:33:04.716 region:rollup2
CD I

00:33:02.314 --> 00:33:06.585 region:rollup2
ONE WE RECOMMEND OF THAT CD I

00:33:04.716 --> 00:33:08.320 region:rollup2
CREATE A PUBLIC REPORT. THAT

00:33:06.585 --> 00:33:10.055 region:rollup2
WOULD RANK WORKERS COMPENSATION

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:11.556 region:rollup2
INSURERS BASED ON THE

00:33:10.055 --> 00:33:14.192 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVENESS OF THEIR ANTI

00:33:11.556 --> 00:33:15.427 region:rollup2
FRAUD EFFORTS INCLUDING THE RATE

00:33:14.192 --> 00:33:17.395 region:rollup2
AT WHICH THEY SUMMIT THESE FRAUD

00:33:15.427 --> 00:33:19.698 region:rollup2
REFERRALS.

00:33:17.395 --> 00:33:21.433 region:rollup2
WE ALSO RECOMMEND AT CDI AT A

00:33:19.698 --> 00:33:23.969 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT THAT IT CONSIDER

00:33:21.433 --> 00:33:26.137 region:rollup2
RATES OF FRAUD CLAIM REFERRALS.

00:33:23.969 --> 00:33:28.306 region:rollup2
WHEN SELECTING INSURERS TO AUDIT

00:33:26.137 --> 00:33:29.708 region:rollup2
AND IT'D GIVE PRIORITY PRIORITY

00:33:28.306 --> 00:33:30.976 region:rollup2
TO THOSE INSURERS WITH HIGH

00:33:29.708 --> 00:33:32.878 region:rollup2
VOLUMES.

00:33:30.976 --> 00:33:35.280 region:rollup2
PREMIUMS AND VERY LOW NUMBERS OF

00:33:32.878 --> 00:33:38.049 region:rollup2

RECOMMENDATIONS IT INDICATED

00:33:41.286 --> 00:33:44.456 region:rollup2
THAT AS IT HAS ALREADY REVISED

INSURERS.

00:33:51.396 --> 00:33:54.933 region:rollup2
THE ANSWER GIVE AUDIT PRIORITY

00:33:52.964 --> 00:33:57.836 region:rollup2
TO THOSE INSURERS WITH HIGH

00:33:54.933 --> 00:33:59.804 region:rollup2
PREMIUMS AND LOW REFERRAL RATES.

00:33:57.836 --> 00:34:01.339 region:rollup2
CD I ALSO INDICATED THAT IT IT

00:33:59.804 --> 00:34:03.341 region:rollup2
HAS IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF

00:34:01.339 --> 00:34:05.010 region:rollup2
FACTORS INCLUDING THE RATE AT

INCLUDING IN A PUBLIC REPORT.

00:34:09.214 --> 00:34:12.317 region:rollup2
THAT WILL RANK WORKERS

00:34:12.317 --> 00:34:14.719 region:rollup2
BASED ON THEIR ANTI FRAUD

THIS REPORT THIS JUNE.

00:34:22.027 --> 00:34:25.697 region:rollup2
WE ALSO FOUND THAT INDUSTRIAL

00:34:25.697 --> 00:34:30.302 region:rollup2
FULLY DOCUMENTED ITS PROCEDURES.

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:31.369 region:rollup2
FOR IMPLEMENTING A CRITICAL TOOL

THESE PROVIDER FRAUD CASES CAN

00:34:36.041 --> 00:34:40.478 region:rollup2
CONTINUE ON THOSE FOR YEARS IN A

00:34:38.009 --> 00:34:42.013 region:rollup2
SINGLE CASE. CAN COST INSURERS

00:34:40.478 --> 00:34:43.949 region:rollup2
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

00:34:42.013 --> 00:34:45.850 region:rollup2
SO TO BETTER FIGHT THIS TYPE OF

00:34:43.949 --> 00:34:47.385 region:rollup2
FRAUD. INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS

ANALYTICS.

00:34:48.586 --> 00:34:52.223 region:rollup2
AND.

00:34:50.155 --> 00:34:54.492 region:rollup2
THIS ALLOWS YOU TO EXAMINE LARGE

00:34:52.223 --> 00:34:56.227 region:rollup2
VOLUMES OF DATA. TO IDENTIFY

00:34:54.492 --> 00:34:58.063 region:rollup2
PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN WORKERS'

COMPENSATION FRAUD.

00:34:58.063 --> 00:35:00.699 region:rollup2
HOWEVER THE DEPARTMENT STILL IN

00:34:59.631 --> 00:35:02.334 region:rollup2
THE BEGINNING STAGES OF

00:35:00.699 --> 00:35:04.469 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTING THIS NEW DATA

00:35:02.334 --> 00:35:06.037 region:rollup2

POTENTIAL PROVIDER FRAUD.

00:35:13.345 --> 00:35:16.681 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THAT DATA ALEX IS A

00:35:15.246 --> 00:35:18.283 region:rollup2
PROMISING TOOL WITH A

00:35:16.681 --> 00:35:19.818 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY HIGHER RATE OF

00:35:19.818 --> 00:35:21.386 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT FOR INVESTOR

IMPLEMENT THESE ANALYTICS

00:35:24.656 --> 00:35:28.827 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY BECAUSE PROVIDER

GOVERNMENTS.

00:35:33.498 --> 00:35:36.835 region:rollup2
TO THAT END WE RECOMMENDED THAT

00:35:40.005 --> 00:35:43.475 region:rollup2
WE RECOMMENDED THAT INVESTOR

00:36:14.906 --> 00:36:17.675 region:rollup2
THESE STATEMENTS WOULD ALLOW

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:20.311 region:rollup2

HOWEVER CALIFORNIA DOES NOT

00:36:51.776 --> 00:36:55.513 region:rollup2
REQUIRE INSURERS FOR WORKERS

WE ALSO FOUND THAT THERE ARE

00:37:21.339 --> 00:37:24.776 region:rollup2
CERTAIN PUBLIC AGENCIES AND SOME

00:37:23.475 --> 00:37:26.945 region:rollup2

RECOVERY OF FUNDS.

00:37:52.871 --> 00:37:56.407 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION CALIFORNIA LAW DOES

00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:58.309 region:rollup2
REQUIRE INSURERS PROVIDING

00:37:56.407 --> 00:37:59.310 region:rollup2

00:38:03.047 --> 00:38:06.217 region:rollup2
IN SUMMARY WE BELIEVE THAT THESE

THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM.

00:38:12.857 --> 00:38:16.127 region:rollup2
AND WE THINK THE BENEFITS OF THE

STATE WAS WOULD LIKELY OUT WAY

00:38:16.127 --> 00:38:20.498 region:rollup2
ANY PERCEIVED DRAWBACKS.

00:38:18.363 --> 00:38:21.1000 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE ONE THING INSURERS

00:38:20.498 --> 00:38:23.868 region:rollup2

WERE PAID IN THAT PERIOD.

00:38:30.608 --> 00:38:33.912 region:rollup2
INSURERS COULD ALSO FORMAT

00:38:32.377 --> 00:38:35.513 region:rollup2
EASIER BE STATE IN SOME WAYS

00:38:33.912 --> 00:38:37.282 region:rollup2
THAT MAKE THEM EASIER FOR

00:38:35.513 --> 00:38:39.417 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES TO UNDERSTAND. FOR

00:38:37.282 --> 00:38:41.352 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE BY USING SIMPLE LANGUAGE

FORMAT.

00:38:44.522 --> 00:38:47.292 region:rollup2
WE RECOMMENDED THAT THE

00:38:45.456 --> 00:38:49.160 region:rollup2

EMPLOYEES BECAUSE WE BELIEVE

00:38:54.766 --> 00:38:58.603 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BETTER ENSURE THAT

00:38:56.167 --> 00:38:59.671 region:rollup2
THE PAYMENTS INSURANCE ISSUE TO

00:38:58.603 --> 00:39:01.406 region:rollup2

VACANCY RATE.

00:40:08.106 --> 00:40:10.708 region:rollup2
WHEN WE WERE LOOKING WHAT WE

00:40:09.374 --> 00:40:12.410 region:rollup2
WANTED TO DO WAS SEE WHAT THE

00:40:10.708 --> 00:40:14.812 region:rollup2
IMPACT OF THIS VACANCY RATE

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:17.482 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE ON THE STATE'S EFFORTS

THE SECOND THING WE LOOKED AT

00:41:06.998 --> 00:41:11.402 region:rollup2
WAS THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER

THAT CD I RECEIVE.

00:41:57.215 --> 00:42:00.985 region:rollup2
THE THIRD ISSUE WE LOOK THAT WAS

00:41:58.950 --> 00:42:02.286 region:rollup2
THAT CD EYES HIGH VACANCY RATE

ADEQUATELY PROCESS ITS CASE LOAD

00:42:14.365 --> 00:42:17.835 region:rollup2

00:42:31.916 --> 00:42:34.986 region:rollup2

00:42:44.962 --> 00:42:48.232 region:rollup2
IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS A HAVING

CGI'S ACKNOWLEDGE THE HIGH

00:43:01.379 --> 00:43:05.750 region:rollup2
VACANCY RATE IS A PROBLEM. AND

00:43:03.614 --> 00:43:07.185 region:rollup2
IT SOUGHT AND RECEIVED A PAY

00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:09.587 region:rollup2

ARE.

00:43:23.935 --> 00:43:26.737 region:rollup2

00:43:41.085 --> 00:43:45.590 region:rollup2
IT ALSO SET UP A STRATEGIC

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:47.525 region:rollup2
VACANCY REPORT THROUGH WHICH

00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:49.560 region:rollup2

00:43:47.525 --> 00:43:51.996 region:rollup2

ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.

00:43:57.335 --> 00:44:00.838 region:rollup2
WE FOUND THAT OTHER STATES AND

00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:02.173 region:rollup2
THREE TWO OF THE THREE COUNTY

00:44:00.838 --> 00:44:04.142 region:rollup2

RECENT COLLEGE GRADUATES.

00:44:14.952 --> 00:44:19.056 region:rollup2
OUR SECOND CONCERN WAS THAT CD I

00:44:16.654 --> 00:44:20.892 region:rollup2
CREATED THE RETENTION PLAN.

00:44:19.056 --> 00:44:22.760 region:rollup2

RETENTION PLAN.

00:44:31.302 --> 00:44:35.039 region:rollup2

OUR ANALYSIS OF SIX SURVEY

00:44:51.189 --> 00:44:55.593 region:rollup2
WERE DISSATISFIED NOT ONLY WITH

00:44:53.491 --> 00:44:57.595 region:rollup2

AND PROCEDURES.

00:45:00.932 --> 00:45:04.835 region:rollup2
WE MAKE TWO RECOMMENDATIONS

00:45:02.466 --> 00:45:06.404 region:rollup2
FIRST THAT CD I REVISE ITS

RECRUITMENT PLAN.

00:45:06.404 --> 00:45:09.307 region:rollup2
TO INCLUDE THE RECRUITMENT AND

00:45:08.172 --> 00:45:11.442 region:rollup2
HIRING OF RETIRED LAW

00:45:09.307 --> 00:45:13.444 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS.

00:45:11.442 --> 00:45:14.312 region:rollup2
AND CDI HAS TAKEN ACTION TO

00:45:13.444 --> 00:45:16.147 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT THAT RECOMMENDATION.

00:45:14.312 --> 00:45:18.749 region:rollup2
SECOND.

00:45:16.147 --> 00:45:20.484 region:rollup2
WE RECOMMENDED THAT CDI DEVELOP

00:45:18.749 --> 00:45:22.186 region:rollup2
AND IMPLEMENT A RETENTION PLAN.

00:45:20.484 --> 00:45:23.821 region:rollup2
CDI IS IN THE PROCESS OF

00:45:22.186 --> 00:45:25.856 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING THAT.

00:45:23.821 --> 00:45:27.124 region:rollup2

00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:32.396 region:rollup2

00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:49.733 region:rollup2
IT FOR A VERY THOROUGH REPORT IN

00:52:47.965 --> 00:52:50.668 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC PART OF PALM IS.

00:52:49.733 --> 00:52:52.102 region:rollup2
WHY YOU WANNA CONVERT FOR THE

00:52:50.668 --> 00:52:54.071 region:rollup2
STATE TO THE STATE'S PAYS IS NOT

00:52:52.102 --> 00:52:56.273 region:rollup2
THAT GOOD?

00:52:54.071 --> 00:52:57.841 region:rollup2
WITHIN THAT WITH ABC NOW DC I.

00:52:56.273 --> 00:52:58.876 region:rollup2
MANY LAST YEAR A. B. C. GOT A

00:52:57.841 --> 00:53:01.412 region:rollup2
RAISE THEIR PROBLEM WITH

00:52:58.876 --> 00:53:02.913 region:rollup2
RECRUITMENT RETENTION. AND SO TO

00:53:01.412 --> 00:53:04.281 region:rollup2
SOME CD I.

00:53:02.913 --> 00:53:05.549 region:rollup2
AND OVERALL IT'S A BIG

00:53:04.281 --> 00:53:06.984 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT NUMBER ONE I MEAN

00:53:05.549 --> 00:53:09.319 region:rollup2
THAT AVERAGED PLEASE PERMITS

00:53:06.984 --> 00:53:11.355 region:rollup2
PLAY ABOUT A HUNDRED OFFICERS

00:53:09.319 --> 00:53:12.956 region:rollup2
THIS IS A TWO AND THIRTY THREE.

00:53:11.355 --> 00:53:14.191 region:rollup2
AND FURTHERMORE SMOKE COMING OUT

00:53:12.956 --> 00:53:15.459 region:rollup2
OF COLLEGE TO ONCE WELCOMING THE

00:53:14.191 --> 00:53:17.728 region:rollup2
CTI THE HAS NO INVESTIGATIVE

00:53:15.459 --> 00:53:18.562 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE. YOU WANT VETERAN LAW

00:53:17.728 --> 00:53:19.797 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AT YOUR

00:53:18.562 --> 00:53:22.399 region:rollup2
BEST BET WOULD RETIRED

00:53:19.797 --> 00:53:24.334 region:rollup2
ANNUITANTS OR EVEN FOLKS THAT.

00:53:22.399 --> 00:53:25.569 region:rollup2
WERE DIFFERENT HARMON SYSTEMS

00:53:24.334 --> 00:53:27.304 region:rollup2
THAT EVERYBODY'S NOT PURRS.

00:53:25.569 --> 00:53:28.806 region:rollup2
LOOK LA THEY HAVE THEIR OWN

00:53:27.304 --> 00:53:30.274 region:rollup2
RETIREMENT SYSTEM IS THE SECOND

00:53:28.806 --> 00:53:32.509 region:rollup2
COUNTY AND. IN A SEVERAL OTHER

00:53:30.274 --> 00:53:33.377 region:rollup2
AGENCIES ARM WHAT'S DISTURBING

00:53:32.509 --> 00:53:34.111 region:rollup2
IS THE AMOUNT OF CASES THAT WERE

00:53:33.377 --> 00:53:36.980 region:rollup2
CLOSED.

00:53:34.111 --> 00:53:38.282 region:rollup2
FORTY PERCENT A WORKERS COMP

00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:38.949 region:rollup2
CASES REFERRALS.

00:53:38.282 --> 00:53:40.451 region:rollup2
WE'RE NEVER INVESTIGATED DUE TO

00:53:38.949 --> 00:53:42.152 region:rollup2
LACK OF MANPOWER AND TO ME

00:53:40.451 --> 00:53:44.254 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE THAT'S THE BIG ISSUE.

00:53:42.152 --> 00:53:45.856 region:rollup2
AND ONE THING ABOUT THE STATE

00:53:44.254 --> 00:53:47.391 region:rollup2
HAVING BEEN HERE FOR SOMETIME

00:53:45.856 --> 00:53:49.993 region:rollup2
NOW. WHEN YOU LOOK AT.

00:53:47.391 --> 00:53:52.463 region:rollup2
UPPER MOBILITY PAY.

00:53:49.993 --> 00:53:54.364 region:rollup2
SEES PEOPLE IS A LOT MORE. IS

00:53:52.463 --> 00:53:55.966 region:rollup2
AGENCIES DO A LOT OF LOCAL

00:53:54.364 --> 00:53:57.568 region:rollup2
AGENCIES PAY A LOT MORE SO WHEN

00:53:55.966 --> 00:53:57.801 region:rollup2
WHEN FOLKS ARE COMING OUT OF

00:53:57.568 --> 00:53:58.836 region:rollup2
COLLEGE.

00:53:57.801 --> 00:54:00.337 region:rollup2
IT'S

00:53:58.836 --> 00:54:01.405 region:rollup2
WHY GO OVER FOR THE STATE WE CAN

00:54:00.337 --> 00:54:03.540 region:rollup2
MAKE MORE MONEY SOMEWHERE ELSE

00:54:01.405 --> 00:54:04.141 region:rollup2
AND HAVE MORE UPWARD MOBILITY

00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:05.275 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S TOUGH IT'S TOUGH

00:54:04.141 --> 00:54:06.810 region:rollup2
HERE.

00:54:05.275 --> 00:54:08.779 region:rollup2
SO YOU KNOW HOW WE CHANGE THAT

00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:11.348 region:rollup2
DYNAMIC IN AND RECRUIT THESE

00:54:08.779 --> 00:54:12.449 region:rollup2
FOLKS AND NO ONE POSSIBILITY IS.

00:54:11.348 --> 00:54:14.084 region:rollup2
A LITTLE HERE SEXTAPE EVER

00:54:12.449 --> 00:54:14.918 region:rollup2
COMMIT JUST PROGRAM WHERE FOLKS

00:54:14.084 --> 00:54:17.688 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH.

00:54:14.918 --> 00:54:18.956 region:rollup2
CHP INSECT BICU THE TO HAVE

00:54:17.688 --> 00:54:20.624 region:rollup2
RECRUITS THE PIPELINE THAT

00:54:18.956 --> 00:54:21.191 region:rollup2
THAT'S ONE WAY FOR MAYBE JOB

00:54:20.624 --> 00:54:22.826 region:rollup2
INTERNS ARE TO COME ON BOARD

00:54:21.191 --> 00:54:25.329 region:rollup2
BUT.

00:54:22.826 --> 00:54:25.963 region:rollup2
TO EACH EVENTUALLY A FULL TIME

00:54:25.329 --> 00:54:27.030 region:rollup2
FOLKS BUT THAT TO ME THE PROBLEM

00:54:25.963 --> 00:54:28.699 region:rollup2
IS.

00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:29.900 region:rollup2
GETTING SOME RETIRED FOLKS IN

00:54:28.699 --> 00:54:31.401 region:rollup2
THERE AND OBVIOUSLY IF YOU'RE

00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:32.469 region:rollup2
NOT PAYING SOME OF RETIRED THE

00:54:31.401 --> 00:54:34.104 region:rollup2
COURT LIMIT NOT NUMBER OF HOURS

00:54:32.469 --> 00:54:35.839 region:rollup2
MISSION UP IN SALARY AND

00:54:34.104 --> 00:54:37.841 region:rollup2
BENEFITS SO. FESCUE SOME WAY TO

00:54:35.839 --> 00:54:38.308 region:rollup2
MATCH THAT AND AND ACTUALLY NAM

00:54:37.841 --> 00:54:40.410 region:rollup2
FIGURED OUT. THE NEXT

00:54:38.308 --> 00:54:41.912 region:rollup2
INTERVIEWS.

00:54:40.410 --> 00:54:43.247 region:rollup2
FOR A LOT OF AGENCIES IT IS

00:54:41.912 --> 00:54:44.548 region:rollup2
MANDATORY PART OF HIM LEAVING

00:54:43.247 --> 00:54:46.583 region:rollup2
THE HAVE IF THE INTERVIEW. THEY

00:54:44.548 --> 00:54:48.218 region:rollup2
CAN REVIEW IF REFUSE TO TALK TO

00:54:46.583 --> 00:54:51.688 region:rollup2
YOU BUT MOST FOLKS WERE TALKING

00:54:48.218 --> 00:54:53.056 region:rollup2
TO A WITH THE ISSUES ARE SO.

00:54:51.688 --> 00:54:53.857 region:rollup2
THAT'S TO BE THAT IS THE POLICY.

00:54:53.056 --> 00:54:55.325 region:rollup2
BEFORE YOU GET YOUR LAST CHECK

00:54:53.857 --> 00:54:56.093 region:rollup2
BEFORE YOU LEAVE ATTORNEY

00:54:55.325 --> 00:54:57.394 region:rollup2
EQUIPMENT AND YOU WILL HAVE AN

00:54:56.093 --> 00:54:58.262 region:rollup2
EXIT INTERVIEW.

00:54:57.394 --> 00:54:59.997 region:rollup2
I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING

00:54:58.262 --> 00:55:01.365 region:rollup2
WITH THE READING THE INSURERS.

00:54:59.997 --> 00:55:03.400 region:rollup2
THAT THAT DO MORE CASES.

00:55:01.365 --> 00:55:04.701 region:rollup2
.

00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:06.036 region:rollup2
BUT THAT THAT'S INTERESTING YOU

00:55:04.701 --> 00:55:07.838 region:rollup2
KNOW IT'S IT'S YOU KNOW

00:55:06.036 --> 00:55:09.406 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY SOME FOLKS OUT THERE.

00:55:07.838 --> 00:55:11.041 region:rollup2
IN THE MIDDLE TO GET BY BUT THAT

00:55:09.406 --> 00:55:12.176 region:rollup2
THINGS AND COMING UP ON THEM. TO

00:55:11.041 --> 00:55:13.677 region:rollup2
HELP US LOWER OUR RACE BECAUSE

00:55:12.176 --> 00:55:15.679 region:rollup2
FRAUD IS A BIG ISSUE WE SEE A

00:55:13.677 --> 00:55:17.748 region:rollup2
LOT. AND SOME AGENCIES HAVE

00:55:15.679 --> 00:55:18.515 region:rollup2
TAKEN AN OATH ACKERMAN COUNTY

00:55:17.748 --> 00:55:20.617 region:rollup2
THE REASON DEPUTY SHERIFFS.

00:55:18.515 --> 00:55:22.386 region:rollup2
FULL TIME TO INVESTIGATE

00:55:20.617 --> 00:55:24.388 region:rollup2
WORKERS COMP FRAUD CASES

00:55:22.386 --> 00:55:26.256 region:rollup2
TELL BUT THAT NAY DID PUT A DENT

00:55:24.388 --> 00:55:27.090 region:rollup2
IN THAT SO. I THINK IS A LOT TO

00:55:26.256 --> 00:55:29.359 region:rollup2
DO.

00:55:27.090 --> 00:55:30.327 region:rollup2
A LOT TO DIVE INTO YOU WITH

LEGACY EVEN LOT INVESTIGATORS

00:55:32.196 --> 00:55:35.332 region:rollup2
THERE BUT THAT THAT THE VACANCY

00:55:33.931 --> 00:55:36.967 region:rollup2
RATE IS JUST UNACCEPTABLE WITH

00:55:35.332 --> 00:55:39.002 region:rollup2
WITH A RAISE LAST YEAR.

00:55:36.967 --> 00:55:40.504 region:rollup2
CDI HAS DO A BETTER JOB GOING

00:55:39.002 --> 00:55:42.406 region:rollup2
OUT AND IN RECRUITING I

00:55:40.504 --> 00:55:43.607 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS OTHER FOLKS ARE OUT

00:55:42.406 --> 00:55:45.609 region:rollup2
THERE LIKE IT'S COMING OUT OF

00:55:43.607 --> 00:55:46.410 region:rollup2
COLLEGE. THAT WANT TO GET

00:55:45.609 --> 00:55:48.111 region:rollup2
INVOLVED AND WANT TO GETTING GAY

00:55:46.410 --> 00:55:50.814 region:rollup2

INTERNET MENTORSHIP PROGRAM TO

00:55:50.814 --> 00:55:53.884 region:rollup2

APPRECIATE THE THE THOROUGHNESS

00:56:12.502 --> 00:56:15.539 region:rollup2
OF YOUR REPORT AND HAVING GONE

00:56:13.370 --> 00:56:17.040 region:rollup2
THROUGH IT. BY A AND I STAND TO

00:56:15.539 --> 00:56:18.508 region:rollup2
BE CORRECTED BUT AS WE BEGAN TO

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:20.544 region:rollup2
PRESENTATION.

00:56:18.508 --> 00:56:22.546 region:rollup2
BY I UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE WAS.

00:56:20.544 --> 00:56:24.214 region:rollup2
STATEMENTS MADE THAT.

00:56:22.546 --> 00:56:26.416 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A QUESTION AS TO THE

00:56:24.214 --> 00:56:27.818 region:rollup2
LEGITIMACY OF THE THE NUMBER OF

00:56:26.416 --> 00:56:29.987 region:rollup2
OR SHALL I SAY THOUGH THE

00:56:27.818 --> 00:56:32.623 region:rollup2
QUESTION TO MAYBE THE LACK OF.

00:56:29.987 --> 00:56:33.490 region:rollup2
REPORTING OF INSURANCE FRAUD.

00:56:32.623 --> 00:56:35.225 region:rollup2
AND HOW THAT.

00:56:33.490 --> 00:56:37.060 region:rollup2
THERE MAY BE INSURANCE FRAUD

00:56:35.225 --> 00:56:38.896 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT BEING REPORTED.

00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:41.431 region:rollup2
BUT THEN I DON'T RUN AND I SEE

00:56:38.896 --> 00:56:43.233 region:rollup2
ALSO ANA A. A IN A FACT SHEET%

00:56:41.431 --> 00:56:44.301 region:rollup2
WHERE CD I IS SAYING THAT THERE

00:56:43.233 --> 00:56:46.436 region:rollup2
ARE ONLY.

00:56:44.301 --> 00:56:48.472 region:rollup2
ABLE TO DEAL WITH FIVE PERCENT

00:56:46.436 --> 00:56:52.109 region:rollup2
WHICH IS AN ASTRONOMICAL NUMBER.

00:56:48.472 --> 00:56:52.676 region:rollup2
THIS FARCE LOW FIVE PERCENT OF

00:56:52.109 --> 00:56:53.543 region:rollup2
THE CASES THAT ARE ACTUALLY

00:56:52.676 --> 00:56:53.977 region:rollup2
REPORTED.

00:56:53.543 --> 00:56:56.613 region:rollup2
AND THEN.

00:56:53.977 --> 00:56:58.649 region:rollup2
THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THAT IS A

00:56:56.613 --> 00:57:00.984 region:rollup2
LACK OF RESOURCES

00:56:58.649 --> 00:57:01.685 region:rollup2
SO MY QUESTION WOULD BE.

00:57:00.984 --> 00:57:06.156 region:rollup2
VISIT.

00:57:01.685 --> 00:57:07.858 region:rollup2
IS THE FOCUS OVER. RIGHT NOW ON.

00:57:06.156 --> 00:57:10.027 region:rollup2
THAT OF THE NUMBER OF REPORTS OR

00:57:07.858 --> 00:57:11.561 region:rollup2
LACKTHEREOF THAT ARE THAT ARE

00:57:10.027 --> 00:57:13.930 region:rollup2
BEING SUBMITTED OR IS IT

00:57:11.561 --> 00:57:16.700 region:rollup2
RESOURCES AND IF IT IS RESOURCES

00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:18.802 region:rollup2
ISN'T LIMITED TO JUST MANPOWER.

00:57:16.700 --> 00:57:20.704 region:rollup2
OR ARE THERE OTHER TYPES OF

00:57:18.802 --> 00:57:21.371 region:rollup2
RESOURCES THAT THEY FEEL THAT

00:57:20.704 --> 00:57:23.540 region:rollup2
THEY ARE LACKING THAT WOULD HAVE

00:57:21.371 --> 00:57:24.741 region:rollup2
MADE A BETTER. AND THEN AS FAR

00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:27.244 region:rollup2
AS THE FUNDING GOES.

00:57:24.741 --> 00:57:29.046 region:rollup2
WHAT IS THE WHAT WHAT ARE THE

00:57:27.244 --> 00:57:30.514 region:rollup2
FUNDING MECHANISMS BUT IS THERE

00:57:29.046 --> 00:57:33.583 region:rollup2
COST RECOVERY?

00:57:30.514 --> 00:57:35.485 region:rollup2
THAT THAT CAN HELP IN AND THE

00:57:33.583 --> 00:57:37.087 region:rollup2
FUNDING OF A DEPARTMENT AS WELL

00:57:35.485 --> 00:57:38.522 region:rollup2
AS FOR THE DA'S.

00:57:37.087 --> 00:57:40.357 region:rollup2
IN THEIR ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO

00:57:38.522 --> 00:57:43.026 region:rollup2
PROSECUTE.

00:57:40.357 --> 00:57:44.194 region:rollup2
SO.

00:57:43.026 --> 00:57:44.795 region:rollup2
A MINUTE YOU HAVE TO A LOT OF

00:57:44.194 --> 00:57:47.631 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS EVER TRY TO PARSE

00:57:44.795 --> 00:57:48.732 region:rollup2
THROUGH THEM AS AS BEST I CAN IF

00:57:47.631 --> 00:57:51.668 region:rollup2
YOU LOOK AT TABLE.

00:57:48.732 --> 00:57:53.203 region:rollup2
ONE ON PAGE EIGHT IT SHOWS IT'S

00:57:51.668 --> 00:57:54.438 region:rollup2
BROKEN DOWN INTO TWO PARTS THE

00:57:53.203 --> 00:57:56.106 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF CASES IN COURT AND

00:57:54.438 --> 00:57:56.640 region:rollup2
THEN THE ESTIMATED CHARGEABLE

00:57:56.106 --> 00:57:58.909 region:rollup2
FRAUD.

00:57:56.640 --> 00:58:00.610 region:rollup2
SHE CAN SEE THAT OVER TIME THE

00:57:58.909 --> 00:58:02.212 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF CASES ACTUALLY STAYED

00:58:00.610 --> 00:58:04.581 region:rollup2
FAIRLY STABLE BUT IF YOU LOOK AT

00:58:02.212 --> 00:58:06.083 region:rollup2
THE AMOUNTS OF CHARGEABLE FRAUD.

00:58:04.581 --> 00:58:07.784 region:rollup2
THAT RIGHT THERE IS TELLING US

00:58:06.083 --> 00:58:09.686 region:rollup2
IF YOU LOOK AT THE INCREASE FROM

00:58:07.784 --> 00:58:12.055 region:rollup2
THE FIRST YEAR ON THE LEFT IT'S

00:58:09.686 --> 00:58:15.125 region:rollup2
TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO.

00:58:12.055 --> 00:58:17.361 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS GOING UP TO.

00:58:15.125 --> 00:58:18.962 region:rollup2
UP TO ALMOST A BILLION DOLLARS

00:58:17.361 --> 00:58:20.263 region:rollup2
IN CHARGEABLE FRAUD ONE OF THE

00:58:18.962 --> 00:58:21.732 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS I HAD WITH THE

00:58:20.263 --> 00:58:22.299 region:rollup2
DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S TOWARDS THE

00:58:21.732 --> 00:58:24.468 region:rollup2
END OF OUR.

00:58:22.299 --> 00:58:25.402 region:rollup2
AT THE END OF THE AUDIT SAID IF

00:58:24.468 --> 00:58:27.137 region:rollup2
WE WERE TO HAVE ONE MORE YEAR

00:58:25.402 --> 00:58:28.939 region:rollup2
THERE THIS DISTRICT ATTORNEY WAS

00:58:27.137 --> 00:58:30.841 region:rollup2
TELLING ME THAT THAT ESTIMATED

00:58:28.939 --> 00:58:33.810 region:rollup2
CHART OF IS NOW OVER A BILLION

00:58:30.841 --> 00:58:36.713 region:rollup2
DOLLARS A YEAR. SO THAT'S A OF A

00:58:33.810 --> 00:58:39.116 region:rollup2
HUGE COMPONENT. INTO ME IT IT

00:58:36.713 --> 00:58:41.351 region:rollup2
SHOWS A COUPLE THINGS NUMBER ONE

00:58:39.116 --> 00:58:44.054 region:rollup2
CD I IN THE DA'S INVESTIGATORS.

00:58:41.351 --> 00:58:45.622 region:rollup2
ARE TRYING TO MAXIMIZE THE VALUE

00:58:44.054 --> 00:58:47.491 region:rollup2
BEHIND THE CASES THAT THEY'RE

00:58:45.622 --> 00:58:48.959 region:rollup2
GETTING IF YOU LOOK AT PROVIDER

00:58:47.491 --> 00:58:50.327 region:rollup2
FRAUD THEY MEANT A CHARGEABLE

00:58:48.959 --> 00:58:51.595 region:rollup2
FRAUD YOU SEE IT GOES FROM ABOUT

00:58:50.327 --> 00:58:53.663 region:rollup2
A HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION IN THE

00:58:51.595 --> 00:58:55.799 region:rollup2
FIRST YEAR. AND IT'S NOW AT

00:58:53.663 --> 00:58:57.401 region:rollup2
EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION SO AGAIN

00:58:55.799 --> 00:58:59.803 region:rollup2
IT SHOWS THAT THEY'RE PUTTING A

00:58:57.401 --> 00:59:01.171 region:rollup2
FOCUS ON WHERE THE MORE

00:58:59.803 --> 00:59:02.639 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE FRAUD SOCK.

00:59:01.171 --> 00:59:04.808 region:rollup2
BUT IT CREATES KIND OF A AS A

00:59:02.639 --> 00:59:06.843 region:rollup2
COROLLARY TYPE CONCERN THAT THAT

00:59:04.808 --> 00:59:07.944 region:rollup2
YOU RAISED IS WHAT ABOUT THE

00:59:06.843 --> 00:59:09.713 region:rollup2
FRAUD THAT THEY'RE NOT

00:59:07.944 --> 00:59:10.814 region:rollup2
IDENTIFYING WHAT'S THERE AND

00:59:09.713 --> 00:59:13.183 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE PURPOSE BEHIND THE

00:59:10.814 --> 00:59:15.352 region:rollup2
CHAPTER THAT THAT MIKE DISCUSSED

00:59:13.183 --> 00:59:17.053 region:rollup2
ON WAYS THAT WE CAN DO. THE

00:59:15.352 --> 00:59:19.122 region:rollup2
STATE CAN DO A BETTER JOB OF

00:59:17.053 --> 00:59:20.657 region:rollup2
SURFACING THESE INSTANCES OF THE

00:59:19.122 --> 00:59:22.392 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL FRAUD HOPEFULLY

00:59:20.657 --> 00:59:23.960 region:rollup2
PROVIDER FRAUD WHICH TENDS TO BE

00:59:22.392 --> 00:59:26.363 region:rollup2
THE MORE EXPENSIVE OUT OF ALL

00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:28.365 region:rollup2
THE FRONT. IN TERMS OF RESOURCES

00:59:26.363 --> 00:59:30.267 region:rollup2

LOCAL DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ARE

00:59:31.701 --> 00:59:35.405 region:rollup2
PRIMARILY FUNDED BY THAT ANNUAL

TWENTY FOUR MILLION OF RECENTLY.

00:59:40.977 --> 00:59:44.881 region:rollup2
AND THEN YOU KNOW WHATEVER THAT

00:59:43.413 --> 00:59:48.251 region:rollup2
THE BALLOTS OF THAT IS GOING

THE FRONT COMMISSION MAY FUND

00:59:54.958 --> 00:59:59.229 region:rollup2
MOST OF THAT REQUEST.

00:59:56.960 --> 01:00:00.997 region:rollup2
IT MADE FUN YOU KNOW JUST SMALL

00:59:59.229 --> 01:00:02.999 region:rollup2
COMPONENTS OF THAT REQUEST.

01:00:00.997 --> 01:00:05.102 region:rollup2

REPRESENTATIVE CAN GO ON A

01:00:11.408 --> 01:00:14.778 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL ABOUT.

01:00:13.276 --> 01:00:17.481 region:rollup2
IT THE FUNDING RESOURCES

01:00:14.778 --> 01:00:19.216 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE TO IT.

01:00:17.481 --> 01:00:21.751 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS SO

01:00:19.216 --> 01:00:23.120 region:rollup2
FOR OUR. OUR STATE AUDITOR AND

01:00:21.751 --> 01:00:24.421 region:rollup2
HER TEAM IT JUST FOLLOWING UP ON

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:24.955 region:rollup2
MISTER GRAYSON QUESTION SO

01:00:24.421 --> 01:00:25.889 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING ELSE IS REMAIN

01:00:24.955 --> 01:00:28.024 region:rollup2
STATIC.

01:00:25.889 --> 01:00:29.493 region:rollup2
EXCEPT FOR THE CHARGEABLE FRAUD

01:00:28.024 --> 01:00:31.261 region:rollup2
HAS GONE UP MORE LESS.

01:00:29.493 --> 01:00:33.130 region:rollup2
CORRECT

01:00:31.261 --> 01:00:34.131 region:rollup2
OKAY AND. I DON'T MEAN TO BE

01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:36.066 region:rollup2
DISRESPECTFUL THE UNDERSTAND

01:00:34.131 --> 01:00:37.868 region:rollup2
WHAT CHARGEABLE FRAUD IS WHAT

01:00:36.066 --> 01:00:39.603 region:rollup2
CHARGEABLE WE HAVE A DEFINITION

01:00:37.868 --> 01:00:40.770 region:rollup2
AND REPORT CHARGEABLE FRAUD IS.

01:00:39.603 --> 01:00:42.672 region:rollup2
FRAUD THAT THE DA'S ARE

01:00:40.770 --> 01:00:44.708 region:rollup2
CONFIDENT THEY BELIEVE THEY CAN

01:00:42.672 --> 01:00:45.876 region:rollup2
PROVE THAT THERE WAS FRAUD THAT

01:00:44.708 --> 01:00:47.511 region:rollup2
WAS COMMITTED AND IT CAN RESULT

01:00:45.876 --> 01:00:49.246 region:rollup2
IN INCOME AND CONVICTION SO

01:00:47.511 --> 01:00:50.447 region:rollup2
THERE MAY BE OTHER SUSPECTED BUT

01:00:49.246 --> 01:00:53.016 region:rollup2
THIS IS. THIS TABLE IS

01:00:50.447 --> 01:00:54.551 region:rollup2
REPRESENTING FRAUD THAT D. A.'S

01:00:53.016 --> 01:00:56.786 region:rollup2
FEEL THEY HAVE A VERY STRONG

01:00:54.551 --> 01:00:58.755 region:rollup2
CASE WHERE THEY CAN PROVE.

01:00:56.786 --> 01:01:00.490 region:rollup2
AND CONVICT EITHER THE PROVIDER

01:00:58.755 --> 01:01:02.726 region:rollup2
THE EMPLOYEE WHOEVER THE. THE.

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:03.293 region:rollup2
PARTY IS THAT.

01:01:02.726 --> 01:01:03.927 region:rollup2
THEY BELIEVE COMMITTED THE

01:01:03.293 --> 01:01:05.095 region:rollup2
FRAUD.

01:01:03.927 --> 01:01:06.630 region:rollup2
SO THEY FEEL VERY CONFIDENT

01:01:05.095 --> 01:01:08.298 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT AND AND AS MISTER

01:01:06.630 --> 01:01:08.932 region:rollup2
CARLSON INDICATED GONE FROM TWO

01:01:08.298 --> 01:01:10.333 region:rollup2
HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO MILLION TWO

01:01:08.932 --> 01:01:11.935 region:rollup2
BILLION AND I THINK THE POINT

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:13.703 region:rollup2
YOU MAKE MISTER GRAYSON IS VERY

01:01:11.935 --> 01:01:15.639 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT. AND THAT'S WHY WE

01:01:13.703 --> 01:01:16.173 region:rollup2
WERE LOOKING AT THIS PROCESS AS

01:01:15.639 --> 01:01:17.440 region:rollup2
YOU ASKED US TO DO MISTER

01:01:16.173 --> 01:01:19.843 region:rollup2
CHAIRMAN.

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:21.511 region:rollup2
HOLISTICALLY FROM UP PREVENTION

01:01:19.843 --> 01:01:23.380 region:rollup2
AND DETECTION BECAUSE IF IF THE

01:01:21.511 --> 01:01:25.081 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. DOES

01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:26.917 region:rollup2
SOME ANALYSIS AND LOOKS AT SOME

01:01:25.081 --> 01:01:28.218 region:rollup2
OF THESE INSURERS AND SAYING YOU

01:01:26.917 --> 01:01:29.519 region:rollup2
HAVE OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY

01:01:28.218 --> 01:01:30.086 region:rollup2
MILLION IN PREMIUMS ARE ON

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:31.821 region:rollup2
AVERAGE YOU KNOW TEN MILLION

01:01:30.086 --> 01:01:33.490 region:rollup2
PER.

01:01:31.821 --> 01:01:34.824 region:rollup2
A AND YOU'RE NOT REFERRING IN

01:01:33.490 --> 01:01:37.394 region:rollup2
THE CASES THAT JUST DOESN'T SEEM

01:01:34.824 --> 01:01:39.029 region:rollup2
REASONABLE. SO IF WE IF THE

01:01:37.394 --> 01:01:39.896 region:rollup2
STATE DOES A BETTER JOB AS FAR

01:01:39.029 --> 01:01:41.631 region:rollup2
AS A DEPARTMENT INSURANCE

01:01:39.896 --> 01:01:42.766 region:rollup2
REQUIRING INSURERS TO REALLY

01:01:41.631 --> 01:01:44.301 region:rollup2
TAKE THESE.

01:01:42.766 --> 01:01:45.835 region:rollup2
NOW REQUIREMENTS IN STATE LAW TO

01:01:44.301 --> 01:01:47.137 region:rollup2
HAPPY SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE

01:01:45.835 --> 01:01:48.772 region:rollup2
UNITS AND RE FIRST SUSPECTED

01:01:47.137 --> 01:01:49.673 region:rollup2
FRAUD TO INSURANCE.

01:01:48.772 --> 01:01:50.840 region:rollup2
INSURANCE NEEDS TO HAVE THE

01:01:49.673 --> 01:01:51.374 region:rollup2
CAPACITY TO BE ABLE TO

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:53.777 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATE THAT SUSPECTED

01:01:51.374 --> 01:01:55.111 region:rollup2
FRAUD.

01:01:53.777 --> 01:01:56.513 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHY WHEN WE LOOKED

01:01:55.111 --> 01:01:57.714 region:rollup2
AT DEPARTMENT INSURANCE AND WE

01:01:56.513 --> 01:01:59.716 region:rollup2
SAID THEY KNOW THEY HAVE A HIGH

01:01:57.714 --> 01:02:01.551 region:rollup2
VACANCY RATE THEY HAVE LOST

01:01:59.716 --> 01:02:03.620 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WE DID AN ANALYSIS

01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:05.155 region:rollup2
AND REPORT WHERE. THEIR SALARY

01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:06.923 region:rollup2
LEVELS WERE NOT COMPARABLE TO

01:02:05.155 --> 01:02:08.258 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE OUGHT

01:02:06.923 --> 01:02:09.859 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT CORRECTION SO THOSE

01:02:08.258 --> 01:02:11.628 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS LOOKING FOR UPWARD

01:02:09.859 --> 01:02:12.929 region:rollup2
MOBILITY I'M GONNA LEAVE THE

01:02:11.628 --> 01:02:14.598 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT SHARON'S I'M GONNA GO

01:02:12.929 --> 01:02:15.632 region:rollup2
OVER TO. OTHER DEPARTMENT

01:02:14.598 --> 01:02:16.633 region:rollup2
JUSTICE I WILL BE AN

01:02:15.632 --> 01:02:18.201 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATOR OF ADVANCEMENT

01:02:16.633 --> 01:02:20.070 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES I WILL BE MAKING

01:02:18.201 --> 01:02:21.504 region:rollup2
MORE MONEY NOW THAT'S WHAT YOU

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:23.240 region:rollup2
WANT OUR STATE EMPLOYEES TO DO.

01:02:21.504 --> 01:02:24.674 region:rollup2
SO INSURANCE NEEDS TO MAKE SURE

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:26.309 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE ANALYZING THEIR

01:02:24.674 --> 01:02:27.677 region:rollup2
SALARIES AND THEY CAN BE AS

01:02:26.309 --> 01:02:29.212 region:rollup2
COMPETITIVE AS POSSIBLE.

01:02:27.677 --> 01:02:30.714 region:rollup2
AS FAR AS RECRUITING I THINK THE

01:02:29.212 --> 01:02:32.782 region:rollup2
POINT MISTER HARPER YOU MADE

01:02:30.714 --> 01:02:33.984 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH THE CSU SYSTEM IN

FROM A DIFFERENT SYSTEM OR THEY

01:02:42.459 --> 01:02:45.795 region:rollup2
WANT TO COME BACK AS A RETIRED

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:47.163 region:rollup2
IN NEWTON AND THEY'RE TEACHING

01:02:45.795 --> 01:02:49.432 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING OUT OF

STATE SERVICE AS A CAREER THEN

01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:56.439 region:rollup2
WE'RE TRAINING THOSE FOLKS SO

01:02:54.938 --> 01:02:58.775 region:rollup2
WHERE ADDRESSING THE DIFF

01:02:56.439 --> 01:03:00.677 region:rollup2
WORKER'S COMP FRAUD HOLISTICALLY

01:03:00.677 --> 01:03:03.713 region:rollup2
INDUSTRIAL ASIANS DOING THE

WE WILL HAVE IN THE FUTURE AS A

01:03:19.162 --> 01:03:22.499 region:rollup2
STATE. THROUGH INDUSTRIALIZATION

01:03:20.897 --> 01:03:24.301 region:rollup2
SENATE'S EFFORTS THAT IT CAN

01:03:22.499 --> 01:03:26.403 region:rollup2
HAND OFF TO INSURANCE AND THE

COMBAT FRAUD BUT IT'S GONNA

01:03:29.706 --> 01:03:34.110 region:rollup2
REQUIRE IMPROVEMENT IN ALL

PROSECUTION. AND THEN YOU'RE

01:03:46.489 --> 01:03:49.559 region:rollup2
GOING TO SEE MORE AND MORE

01:03:48.091 --> 01:03:51.261 region:rollup2
DETERRENCE AS FAR AS.

01:03:49.559 --> 01:03:52.595 region:rollup2
WE WE AS A STATE ARE DOING A

01:03:51.261 --> 01:03:54.798 region:rollup2
BETTER JOB OF.

01:03:52.595 --> 01:03:56.099 region:rollup2
IDENTIFYING SUSPECTED FRAUD AND

01:03:54.798 --> 01:03:57.834 region:rollup2
THEN BEING ABLE TO PROSECUTE

01:03:56.099 --> 01:03:59.602 region:rollup2
THAT FRAUD WHICH HOPEFULLY WILL

01:03:57.834 --> 01:04:01.037 region:rollup2
DETERMINE THE VISUALS FROM

01:03:59.602 --> 01:04:02.405 region:rollup2
COMMITTING FRAUD IN THE FUTURE.

01:04:01.037 --> 01:04:04.374 region:rollup2
AND I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU

01:04:02.405 --> 01:04:06.543 region:rollup2
FOR THAT DEEPER EXPLANATION I

01:04:04.374 --> 01:04:06.910 region:rollup2
JUST TO CLOSE BY THAT YOU CHAIR.

01:04:06.543 --> 01:04:08.478 region:rollup2
AND.

01:04:06.910 --> 01:04:11.715 region:rollup2
BY I MADE REFERENCE TO

01:04:08.478 --> 01:04:13.283 region:rollup2
RESOURCES AND THE REFERENCE WAS

01:04:11.715 --> 01:04:14.284 region:rollup2
THAT BECAUSE OF A LACK OF

01:04:13.283 --> 01:04:16.419 region:rollup2
RESOURCES ONLY FIVE PERCENT ARE

01:04:14.284 --> 01:04:18.154 region:rollup2
BEING DEALT WITH.

01:04:16.419 --> 01:04:20.457 region:rollup2
IS THIS THE WORD RESOURCE

01:04:18.154 --> 01:04:22.125 region:rollup2
LIMITED TO JUST MANPOWER OR IS

01:04:20.457 --> 01:04:23.927 region:rollup2
IT BECAUSE.

01:04:22.125 --> 01:04:24.761 region:rollup2
THOUGH THE MANPOWER THAT IS

01:04:23.927 --> 01:04:26.062 region:rollup2
PRESENT THE WORK FORCE THAT IS

01:04:24.761 --> 01:04:27.897 region:rollup2
PRESENT.

01:04:26.062 --> 01:04:29.165 region:rollup2
THEY MAY NOT HAVE THE TOOLS THAT

01:04:27.897 --> 01:04:30.433 region:rollup2
THEY FEEL THEY NEED THEREFORE

01:04:29.165 --> 01:04:31.434 region:rollup2
GETTING FRUSTRATED THEREFORE

01:04:30.433 --> 01:04:32.869 region:rollup2
THEY GO AND FIND SOME OTHER

01:04:31.434 --> 01:04:35.405 region:rollup2
PLACE TO WORK.

01:04:32.869 --> 01:04:37.874 region:rollup2
I KNOW THAT IN LAW ENFORCEMENT.

01:04:35.405 --> 01:04:39.209 region:rollup2
THERE'S A TOOL THAT I AND I ALSO

01:04:37.874 --> 01:04:40.543 region:rollup2
BROUGHT UP COST RECOVERY SO

01:04:39.209 --> 01:04:41.010 region:rollup2
THERE'S A TOOL THAT FOR CERTAIN

01:04:40.543 --> 01:04:42.979 region:rollup2
CRIMES YOU HAVE ASSET

01:04:41.010 --> 01:04:45.482 region:rollup2
FORFEITURE.

01:04:42.979 --> 01:04:48.651 region:rollup2
FOR IN LARGER CASES OF FRAUD.

01:04:45.482 --> 01:04:50.153 region:rollup2
IS THERE THAT TOOL THAT HELPS

01:04:48.651 --> 01:04:51.388 region:rollup2
COST RECOVERY THAT WOULD PROVIDE

01:04:50.153 --> 01:04:52.856 region:rollup2
THE MEANS

01:04:51.388 --> 01:04:54.824 region:rollup2
FOR THE TECHNOLOGY AND FOR THE

01:04:52.856 --> 01:04:56.259 region:rollup2
TOOLBOX FOR THE WORK FORCE TO BE

01:04:54.824 --> 01:04:58.595 region:rollup2
ABLE TO DO EVEN A BETTER AND

01:04:56.259 --> 01:05:01.297 region:rollup2
MORE EFFICIENT JOB.

01:04:58.595 --> 01:05:02.999 region:rollup2
SURE REST RESTITUTION FINES AND

01:05:01.297 --> 01:05:05.201 region:rollup2
PENALTIES THERE'S A VARIETY OF

01:05:02.999 --> 01:05:05.702 region:rollup2
OF LET'S SAY IN INCOME STREAM

01:05:05.201 --> 01:05:06.970 region:rollup2
THAT CAN COME FROM THOSE

01:05:05.702 --> 01:05:09.472 region:rollup2
SOURCES.

01:05:06.970 --> 01:05:10.907 region:rollup2
WE WE SAW THAT THEY WERE THERE

01:05:09.472 --> 01:05:12.942 region:rollup2
WE DID NOT SPEND ANY TIME

01:05:10.907 --> 01:05:14.577 region:rollup2
ANALYZING THAT WE WERE FOCUSING

01:05:12.942 --> 01:05:15.912 region:rollup2
PRIMARILY ON THE ALLOCATIONS

01:05:14.577 --> 01:05:18.248 region:rollup2
THAT CAME THROUGH THE FRONT OF

01:05:15.912 --> 01:05:19.783 region:rollup2
SEISMIC MISTER.

01:05:18.248 --> 01:05:21.351 region:rollup2
AND THE VICE CHAIR MISTER MAYES

01:05:19.783 --> 01:05:22.752 region:rollup2
HAS QUESTION.

01:05:21.351 --> 01:05:23.052 region:rollup2
I JUST FOR CLARIFICATION YOU

01:05:22.752 --> 01:05:24.821 region:rollup2
MIGHT OF.

01:05:23.052 --> 01:05:26.689 region:rollup2
MIGHT A PARTY ADDRESS THIS BUT

01:05:24.821 --> 01:05:27.657 region:rollup2
JUST LOOKING AT THIS A TABLE ONE

01:05:26.689 --> 01:05:29.459 region:rollup2
HERE.

01:05:27.657 --> 01:05:30.026 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF

01:05:29.459 --> 01:05:32.362 region:rollup2
CASES IN COURT A RELATIVELY

01:05:30.026 --> 01:05:33.630 region:rollup2
FLAT.

01:05:32.362 --> 01:05:35.165 region:rollup2
FROM THAT THAT THE THREE YEAR

01:05:33.630 --> 01:05:36.099 region:rollup2
PERIOD OF TIME.

01:05:35.165 --> 01:05:38.201 region:rollup2
WELL ALTHOUGH THE CHARGE WILL

01:05:36.099 --> 01:05:39.669 region:rollup2
FRAUD NUMBERS ARE THREE TIMES

01:05:38.201 --> 01:05:40.637 region:rollup2
THE AMOUNT AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE

01:05:39.669 --> 01:05:42.305 region:rollup2
PROVIDER.

01:05:40.637 --> 01:05:44.174 region:rollup2
IS IS THE CAUSE THAT CAN YOU

01:05:42.305 --> 01:05:47.143 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT THAT.

01:05:44.174 --> 01:05:48.745 region:rollup2
YES PROVIDER FRAUD IS WHEN WE

01:05:47.143 --> 01:05:51.114 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE SF SEASON THOSE AT

01:05:48.745 --> 01:05:53.016 region:rollup2
BAY WAR. INVESTIGATING BECAUSE

01:05:51.114 --> 01:05:53.917 region:rollup2
OF THE LACK RESOURCES WHAT WE

01:05:53.016 --> 01:05:55.185 region:rollup2
DID IS BECAUSE OF THE WAY

01:05:53.917 --> 01:05:56.886 region:rollup2
THEY'RE TRACKING SYSTEM IS IT

01:05:55.185 --> 01:05:58.455 region:rollup2
ALLOWED US TO LOOK AT WHAT TYPE

01:05:56.886 --> 01:06:00.290 region:rollup2
OF FRAUD WAS IT WAS AN EMPLOYEE

01:05:58.455 --> 01:06:01.591 region:rollup2
FRAUD WAS EMPLOYER FRAUD WAS A

01:06:00.290 --> 01:06:03.293 region:rollup2
PROVIDER FRAUD.

01:06:01.591 --> 01:06:04.861 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE SAW AND THOSE THAT

01:06:03.293 --> 01:06:07.864 region:rollup2
WERE.

01:06:04.861 --> 01:06:09.632 region:rollup2
BUT EMPLOYEE FRAUD THE AVERAGE

01:06:07.864 --> 01:06:11.901 region:rollup2
WAS IN THIS IN IT IN THE FEW

01:06:09.632 --> 01:06:13.803 region:rollup2
THOUSAND RANGE WHEN WE LOOKED AT

01:06:11.901 --> 01:06:15.872 region:rollup2
WHAT THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF THIS

01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:17.373 region:rollup2
IS ALLEGE FRAUD AS OPPOSED TO

01:06:15.872 --> 01:06:19.776 region:rollup2
THAT CHARGEABLE FRAUD.

01:06:17.373 --> 01:06:22.679 region:rollup2
THE ALLEGE FRAUD ON THE PROVIDER

01:06:19.776 --> 01:06:25.248 region:rollup2
SIDE WAS IN THE SEVENTY THOUSAND

01:06:22.679 --> 01:06:27.550 region:rollup2
PER RANGE SO EACH PROVIDER

01:06:25.248 --> 01:06:29.719 region:rollup2
BASICALLY ON THESE ALLEGATIONS.

01:06:27.550 --> 01:06:32.188 region:rollup2
THAT THE CONCERN IS THAT THEY

01:06:29.719 --> 01:06:35.024 region:rollup2
ARE GOING AFTER BIGGER CHUNKS OF

01:06:32.188 --> 01:06:38.094 region:rollup2
THE WORKERS COMPENSATION POT.

01:06:35.024 --> 01:06:40.730 region:rollup2
IT IS THEN SAY AN EMPLOYEE OR

01:06:38.094 --> 01:06:43.066 region:rollup2
PERHAPS EVEN A PROVIDER.

01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:45.268 region:rollup2
SO IT'S SO TO TO ADD TO THAT SO

01:06:43.066 --> 01:06:46.569 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEE COMMITTING FRAUD MAY BE

01:06:45.268 --> 01:06:47.103 region:rollup2
FIVE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A

01:06:46.569 --> 01:06:49.038 region:rollup2
PROVIDER MAY BE COMMITTING

01:06:47.103 --> 01:06:51.307 region:rollup2
FRAUD.

01:06:49.038 --> 01:06:52.775 region:rollup2
WITH A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT.

01:06:51.307 --> 01:06:54.777 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE RECEIVING

01:06:52.775 --> 01:06:55.612 region:rollup2
CARE FOR THAT FROM THAT PROVIDER

01:06:54.777 --> 01:06:57.413 region:rollup2
SO THE PROVIDER MAY BE

01:06:55.612 --> 01:06:58.648 region:rollup2
COMMITTING TEN MILLION DOLLARS

01:06:57.413 --> 01:07:00.617 region:rollup2
WORTH OF FRAUD THAT'S WHY YOU'RE

01:06:58.648 --> 01:07:03.019 region:rollup2
SEEING THE AMOUNT GOING UP AS WE

01:07:00.617 --> 01:07:04.687 region:rollup2
HAVE MORE PROVIDERS. IT'S OF

01:07:03.019 --> 01:07:07.257 region:rollup2
RELATIVELY FLAT AS FAR AS THE

01:07:04.687 --> 01:07:09.492 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF CASES BUT THE VOLUME

01:07:07.257 --> 01:07:11.561 region:rollup2
THE DOLLAR VOLUME FOR A PROVIDER

01:07:09.492 --> 01:07:13.029 region:rollup2
IS MUCH HIGHER THAN A SPECIFIC

01:07:11.561 --> 01:07:15.164 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEE WHO MAYBE.

01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:19.002 region:rollup2
FRAUDULENTLY CLAIMING CLAIMING A

01:07:15.164 --> 01:07:20.770 region:rollup2
AN INJURY.

01:07:19.002 --> 01:07:23.072 region:rollup2

01:22:04.953 --> 01:22:08.123 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN

01:22:07.122 --> 01:22:09.391 region:rollup2
AND.

01:22:08.123 --> 01:22:10.893 region:rollup2
IN OUR RECRUITMENT EFFORTS WE

01:22:09.391 --> 01:22:12.361 region:rollup2
HAVE MOVED A LOT OF PEOPLE INTO

01:22:10.893 --> 01:22:14.196 region:rollup2
THAT BACKGROUND CHECK AT THIS

01:22:12.361 --> 01:22:17.266 region:rollup2
POINT IN TIME.

01:22:14.196 --> 01:22:18.167 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE STILL HAVE THAT.

01:22:17.266 --> 01:22:19.902 region:rollup2
PRETTY SIGNIFICANT PAY

01:22:18.167 --> 01:22:22.638 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE.

01:22:19.902 --> 01:22:24.606 region:rollup2
AND FOR STATE EMPLOYEES YOU KNOW

01:22:22.638 --> 01:22:25.073 region:rollup2
A THREE PERCENT RAISE WOULD BE A

01:22:24.606 --> 01:22:26.975 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE.

01:22:25.073 --> 01:22:28.243 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:22:26.975 --> 01:22:30.746 region:rollup2
THE DIFFERENT DIFFERENTIAL

01:22:28.243 --> 01:22:33.115 region:rollup2
BETWEEN OUR AGENCY AND.

01:22:30.746 --> 01:22:34.950 region:rollup2
OF FOR EXAMPLE A SIMILAR

01:22:33.115 --> 01:22:36.819 region:rollup2
CLASSIFICATION AT THE TOP OF THE

01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:39.054 region:rollup2
RANGE.

01:22:36.819 --> 01:22:41.790 region:rollup2
FOR OUR INVESTIGATOR VERSUS A

01:22:39.054 --> 01:22:44.126 region:rollup2
DOJ SPECIAL SPECIAL AGENT THEY

01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:45.928 region:rollup2
WOULD MAKE CLOSE TO THIRTEEN

01:22:44.126 --> 01:22:48.063 region:rollup2
PERCENT HIGHER PAY.

01:22:45.928 --> 01:22:50.199 region:rollup2
AND ACTUALLY THE NUMBERS ARE

01:22:48.063 --> 01:22:52.501 region:rollup2
EVEN BIGGER FOR. SOME OF THE.

01:22:50.199 --> 01:22:54.303 region:rollup2
COMPARISONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT

01:22:52.501 --> 01:22:55.871 region:rollup2
OF CORRECTIONS.

01:22:54.303 --> 01:22:57.339 region:rollup2
INCLUDING A JUST FOR THE ENTRY

01:22:55.871 --> 01:22:59.141 region:rollup2
LEVEL.

01:22:57.339 --> 01:23:01.143 region:rollup2
CANDIDATE BUT AT THE TOP OF THE

01:22:59.141 --> 01:23:02.477 region:rollup2
RANGE SO AN EXPERIENCED PERSON

01:23:01.143 --> 01:23:04.446 region:rollup2
AT THE ENTRY LEVEL

01:23:02.477 --> 01:23:06.582 region:rollup2
CLASSIFICATION. THERE BE A

01:23:04.446 --> 01:23:07.549 region:rollup2
THIRTY PLUS DIFFERENTIAL.

01:23:06.582 --> 01:23:09.384 region:rollup2
WITH.

01:23:07.549 --> 01:23:11.019 region:rollup2
A SPECIAL AGENT AT THE

01:23:09.384 --> 01:23:13.121 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS.

01:23:11.019 --> 01:23:15.123 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT DRAW OF

01:23:13.121 --> 01:23:19.361 region:rollup2
COURSE TO A STATE EMPLOYEE SHARE

01:23:15.123 --> 01:23:20.195 region:rollup2
THAT'S LOOKING TO UP YOU KNOW

YEAH SO IT IS.

01:23:24.299 --> 01:23:25.167 region:rollup2
IT'S CERTAINLY A WE TOOK INTO

01:23:24.900 --> 01:23:26.969 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT.

01:23:25.167 --> 01:23:29.204 region:rollup2

WORK JUST AS HARD AND COMMIT THE

01:30:37.065 --> 01:30:41.336 region:rollup2
SAME LEVEL OF EFFORT.

01:30:38.667 --> 01:30:43.104 region:rollup2

SOMETIMES MY MEMBERS FEEL IN

01:30:45.273 --> 01:30:49.077 region:rollup2
EXAMINING AND REEXAMINING AND

01:30:47.309 --> 01:30:50.412 region:rollup2
DELAYING AND DENYING TREATMENT.

MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BACK FILLING

01:30:57.152 --> 01:31:01.156 region:rollup2

01:31:01.156 --> 01:31:05.060 region:rollup2
THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM.

01:31:03.792 --> 01:31:06.628 region:rollup2
UP SO WE THINK THE POSITIVE

01:31:05.060 --> 01:31:07.929 region:rollup2
IMPACT OF THAT KIND OF LEVEL

01:31:06.628 --> 01:31:10.165 region:rollup2
EQUAL LEVEL OF EFFORT WOULD BE

01:31:07.929 --> 01:31:12.167 region:rollup2
DRAMATIC ON THE SYSTEM.

01:31:10.165 --> 01:31:13.635 region:rollup2
I DO STILL HERE WEEKLY FROM MY

01:31:12.167 --> 01:31:15.036 region:rollup2

TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE.

01:31:19.808 --> 01:31:23.244 region:rollup2
A.

01:31:22.077 --> 01:31:25.180 region:rollup2
AND IT SEEMS THAT THE FINALLY

01:31:23.244 --> 01:31:26.481 region:rollup2
THIS THE STUDY SUPPORTS MORE

01:31:25.180 --> 01:31:27.983 region:rollup2
INSURERS PRIMER SKIN IN THE GAME

01:31:26.481 --> 01:31:30.251 region:rollup2
AS I MENTION.

01:31:27.983 --> 01:31:30.452 region:rollup2
BUT ONE OTHER ITEM MAYBE THIS IS

01:31:30.251 --> 01:31:33.221 region:rollup2
JUST.

01:31:30.452 --> 01:31:34.789 region:rollup2
OF FRUSTRATION OF THE CPF THAT

01:31:33.221 --> 01:31:37.792 region:rollup2
IT SOMETIMES SEEMS THAT EVEN

01:31:34.789 --> 01:31:39.327 region:rollup2
WHEN. WE ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS

BARRIERS TO INJURED WORKERS.

01:31:50.005 --> 01:31:51.473 region:rollup2
IN AN ATTEMPT TO GET AT THE

WE HAVE WE ARE AT THE TABLE

01:31:55.477 --> 01:31:59.681 region:rollup2
RIVER REMAIN AT THE TABLE WE WE

01:31:57.679 --> 01:32:01.649 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THE PROCESSES SHOULD

01:31:59.681 --> 01:32:03.251 region:rollup2
BECOME MORE COMPLICATED FOR

01:32:01.649 --> 01:32:05.020 region:rollup2
INJURED WORKERS IN ORDER TO THE.

01:32:03.251 --> 01:32:06.721 region:rollup2
TO ERADICATE THIS FRAUD IN THE

01:32:05.020 --> 01:32:08.723 region:rollup2
OTHER PARTS OF THE SYSTEM.

01:32:06.721 --> 01:32:09.991 region:rollup2

SAVINGS ARE BEING PLOWED BACK

01:32:24.939 --> 01:32:28.109 region:rollup2

THAT'S A THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY

01:35:32.961 --> 01:35:35.997 region:rollup2
IF YOU JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

01:35:33.928 --> 01:35:37.632 region:rollup2
AND AND THE AUDITOR.

01:35:35.997 --> 01:35:38.967 region:rollup2

ASSOCIATED DOCUMENTS MADE A VERY

01:35:38.967 --> 01:35:41.936 region:rollup2
GOOD POINT. AND THAT WAS IN PART

01:35:41.169 --> 01:35:43.171 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF ITS SIZE AND

01:35:41.936 --> 01:35:44.439 region:rollup2
COMPLEXITY TO CALIFORNIA'S

01:35:43.171 --> 01:35:45.640 region:rollup2
WORKER'S COMPENSATION SYSTEM

01:35:44.439 --> 01:35:46.674 region:rollup2
CREATES AMPLE OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:47.976 region:rollup2
FRAUD.

01:35:46.674 --> 01:35:48.610 region:rollup2
THIS MAY SOUND FAMILIAR IF

01:35:47.976 --> 01:35:50.111 region:rollup2
YOU'VE BEEN IN THIS COMMITTEE A

01:35:48.610 --> 01:35:51.913 region:rollup2

AND OBJECTIVITY LETS TRY TO KEEP

01:35:58.319 --> 01:36:01.656 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE

01:35:59.921 --> 01:36:03.124 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE LABOR CODE AND

01:36:01.656 --> 01:36:04.692 region:rollup2
THE RULES THAT DICTATE WORKERS

01:36:03.124 --> 01:36:05.260 region:rollup2
COMPENSATION I AND THAT VERY

01:36:04.692 --> 01:36:06.794 region:rollup2
THIN PAPER THAT WE ALL DEAL

01:36:05.260 --> 01:36:08.363 region:rollup2
WITH.

01:36:06.794 --> 01:36:09.897 region:rollup2
IS ABOUT THAT THICK. WHEN I

01:36:08.363 --> 01:36:11.366 region:rollup2
FIRST STARTED IN WORKERS COMP IN

01:36:09.897 --> 01:36:12.934 region:rollup2
NINETEEN NINETY NINE OR SO IT

01:36:11.366 --> 01:36:13.534 region:rollup2
WAS OF ABOUT THAT BECAUSE ABOUT

01:36:12.934 --> 01:36:14.802 region:rollup2
HALF OF IT.

01:36:13.534 --> 01:36:17.271 region:rollup2
I'M SO THIS REALLY IS A VERY

01:36:14.802 --> 01:36:19.674 region:rollup2
COMPLEX HARD TO UNDERSTAND A

01:36:17.271 --> 01:36:21.009 region:rollup2
SYSTEM OF BENEFIT DELIVERY. OF

01:36:19.674 --> 01:36:22.677 region:rollup2
THE CREATES LOTS OF NOOKS AND

01:36:21.009 --> 01:36:24.479 region:rollup2
CRANNIES AND WHICH PEOPLE CAN

01:36:22.677 --> 01:36:25.780 region:rollup2
HIDE AND JUST.

01:36:24.479 --> 01:36:27.148 region:rollup2
SHEER A DOLLAR OFF THE TOP HERE

01:36:25.780 --> 01:36:28.182 region:rollup2
A DOLLAR OFF THE TOP THERE AND

01:36:27.148 --> 01:36:29.751 region:rollup2
IF YOU DO THAT A COUPLE HUNDRED

01:36:28.182 --> 01:36:31.586 region:rollup2
THOUSAND TIMES ARE YOU ACTUALLY

01:36:29.751 --> 01:36:32.654 region:rollup2
HAVE SOME REAL MONEY. AS TO

01:36:31.586 --> 01:36:33.821 region:rollup2
KEEPING THE SYSTEM SIMPLE

01:36:32.654 --> 01:36:36.357 region:rollup2
UNIFORM.

01:36:33.821 --> 01:36:37.892 region:rollup2
AN OBJECTIVE TO US IS ALWAYS A

01:36:36.357 --> 01:36:39.360 region:rollup2
KEY POINT WE'RE GLAD THAT THE

01:36:37.892 --> 01:36:41.029 region:rollup2
AUDITOR PICKED UP ON THAT.

01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:42.397 region:rollup2
IN THEIR REPORT.

01:36:41.029 --> 01:36:43.031 region:rollup2
AND TO THE POINT CHRISTIE MADE

01:36:42.397 --> 01:36:44.198 region:rollup2
EARLIER.

01:36:43.031 --> 01:36:45.667 region:rollup2
THERE ARE REALLY THREE

01:36:44.198 --> 01:36:47.435 region:rollup2
CATEGORIES OF FRAUD THAT WE SEE

01:36:45.667 --> 01:36:48.569 region:rollup2
A MEDICAL PROVIDER FRAUD OR

01:36:47.435 --> 01:36:49.771 region:rollup2
PROVIDER FRAUD IN GENERAL

01:36:48.569 --> 01:36:51.005 region:rollup2
DOESN'T BE PROVIDER COULD BE

01:36:49.771 --> 01:36:52.040 region:rollup2
COPY SERVICE COULD BE ANY NUMBER

01:36:51.005 --> 01:36:54.275 region:rollup2
OF THANKS.

01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:54.475 region:rollup2
PREMIUM FRAUD BY EMPLOYERS AND

01:36:54.275 --> 01:36:57.211 region:rollup2
THEN.

01:36:54.475 --> 01:36:58.813 region:rollup2
AS OBSERVED BY CHRISTIE UMP

01:36:57.211 --> 01:37:00.415 region:rollup2
THAT THE SMALLEST CATEGORY I AND

01:36:58.813 --> 01:37:01.049 region:rollup2
I THINK THE CATEGORY WE LIKE TO

01:37:00.415 --> 01:37:01.749 region:rollup2
SPEND THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIME

01:37:01.049 --> 01:37:02.583 region:rollup2
ON.

01:37:01.749 --> 01:37:04.886 region:rollup2
IS.

01:37:02.583 --> 01:37:07.221 region:rollup2
FRAUD BY INJURED WORKERS.

01:37:04.886 --> 01:37:08.323 region:rollup2
.

01:37:07.221 --> 01:37:10.625 region:rollup2
LARA POINTED OUT ONE THREE

01:37:08.323 --> 01:37:12.393 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS A AND FRAUD IN

01:37:10.625 --> 01:37:13.127 region:rollup2
THE WORKERS COMP SYSTEM A PRE

01:37:12.393 --> 01:37:14.429 region:rollup2
YEAR AND WHERE THIS GETS

01:37:13.127 --> 01:37:15.797 region:rollup2
FRUSTRATING UNTHINKABLE

01:37:14.429 --> 01:37:18.099 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES.

01:37:15.797 --> 01:37:19.901 region:rollup2
IS THAT WE HAVE SPENT.

01:37:18.099 --> 01:37:21.736 region:rollup2
IMMEASURABLE HOURS IN THIS

01:37:19.901 --> 01:37:23.504 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE ARGUING OVER WAY LESS

01:37:21.736 --> 01:37:25.106 region:rollup2
MONEY FOR INJURED WORKERS.

01:37:23.504 --> 01:37:26.774 region:rollup2
SO IT'S VERY PERSONAL.

01:37:25.106 --> 01:37:27.842 region:rollup2
TO THE PEOPLE WHO EMPLOY

01:37:26.774 --> 01:37:29.243 region:rollup2
WORKERS IN THE STATE AND THE

01:37:27.842 --> 01:37:30.445 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO REPRESENT WORKERS IN

01:37:29.243 --> 01:37:32.246 region:rollup2
THE STATE WE'RE ARGUING OVER

01:37:30.445 --> 01:37:33.381 region:rollup2
THOSE THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY. AND

01:37:32.246 --> 01:37:34.615 region:rollup2
WHILE PEOPLE ARE KIND OF*

01:37:33.381 --> 01:37:35.650 region:rollup2
NILLY JUST OUT THERE STEALING IT

01:37:34.615 --> 01:37:37.185 region:rollup2
FROM US.

01:37:35.650 --> 01:37:38.986 region:rollup2
SO WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB

01:37:37.185 --> 01:37:40.221 region:rollup2
WITH FRAUD A NOT.

01:37:38.986 --> 01:37:41.723 region:rollup2
TO SAVE MY MEMBERS A BUNCH OF

01:37:40.221 --> 01:37:42.590 region:rollup2
MONEY AT THAT FRANKLY TO THE

01:37:41.723 --> 01:37:43.758 region:rollup2
POINT CHRISTY WAS MAKING SO

01:37:42.590 --> 01:37:44.926 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT SITTING HERE ARGUING

01:37:43.758 --> 01:37:46.394 region:rollup2
WITH EACH OTHER.

01:37:44.926 --> 01:37:48.830 region:rollup2
OVER THE ADEQUACY OF BENEFITS

01:37:46.394 --> 01:37:50.098 region:rollup2
FOR INJURED WORKERS.

01:37:48.830 --> 01:37:50.998 region:rollup2
I DO WANNA TOUCH ON ONE

01:37:50.098 --> 01:37:53.134 region:rollup2

01:38:13.621 --> 01:38:15.690 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT GONNA GET A FLOOD OF

01:38:14.589 --> 01:38:18.426 region:rollup2
THESE THINGSAND EMAILS THAT

01:38:15.690 --> 01:38:19.293 region:rollup2
THERE IS A DESCRIPTION OF AB

01:38:18.426 --> 01:38:20.628 region:rollup2
QUARTERLY STATEMENTS.

01:38:19.293 --> 01:38:22.230 region:rollup2
WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS BUT

01:38:20.628 --> 01:38:23.731 region:rollup2
THAT'S GENERALLY AS AN IDEA I I

01:38:22.230 --> 01:38:25.032 region:rollup2
THINK THERE IS A COST OBVIOUSLY

01:38:23.731 --> 01:38:26.000 region:rollup2
FOR PROVIDING THESE.

01:38:25.032 --> 01:38:27.735 region:rollup2
THESE NOTICES.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:29.437 region:rollup2
.

01:38:27.735 --> 01:38:31.205 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK GENERALLY SPEAKING

01:38:29.437 --> 01:38:32.707 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT SURE THAT IT WILL DO

01:38:31.205 --> 01:38:34.175 region:rollup2
MUCH GOOD FOR INJURED WORKERS TO

01:38:32.707 --> 01:38:35.843 region:rollup2
RECEIVE THE INFORMATION I I

01:38:34.175 --> 01:38:37.078 region:rollup2

TELL YOU WHEN I LOOK AT SOME OF

01:38:41.849 --> 01:38:44.519 region:rollup2
THESE BILLING CODES AND BUILDING

01:38:43.317 --> 01:38:45.052 region:rollup2
PRACTICES AND THAT'S TECHNICAL

01:38:44.519 --> 01:38:47.155 region:rollup2
INFORMATION. MY HEAD STILL

01:38:45.052 --> 01:38:48.456 region:rollup2
SWIMS.

01:38:47.155 --> 01:38:50.024 region:rollup2
.

01:38:48.456 --> 01:38:50.992 region:rollup2
WE SAID AND IF WE IF I WERE TO

01:38:50.024 --> 01:38:52.293 region:rollup2
PRINT FOR YOU ALL OF THE NOTICE

01:38:50.992 --> 01:38:53.928 region:rollup2
THAT THAT ARE SENT TO AN INJURED

01:38:52.293 --> 01:38:55.129 region:rollup2
WORKER.

01:38:53.928 --> 01:38:56.030 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE CLAIM FOR

01:38:55.129 --> 01:38:57.498 region:rollup2
INDEMNITY CLAIM IT WOULD BE

01:38:56.030 --> 01:38:58.766 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT THICK.

01:38:57.498 --> 01:38:59.734 region:rollup2
SO THEY ARE GETTING A LOT OF

01:38:58.766 --> 01:39:00.902 region:rollup2
MAIL FROM US.

01:38:59.734 --> 01:39:02.837 region:rollup2
MINUTES IMPORTANT MAIL IT'S

01:39:00.902 --> 01:39:03.905 region:rollup2
MALE THE TALKS ABOUT. WHEN THEIR

01:39:02.837 --> 01:39:04.439 region:rollup2
BENEFITS ARE STARTING AND

01:39:03.905 --> 01:39:06.440 region:rollup2
STOPPING.

01:39:04.439 --> 01:39:07.308 region:rollup2
APES MAIL THAT TALKS ABOUT WHAT

01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:08.576 region:rollup2
MEDICAL TREATMENTS ARE BEING

01:39:07.308 --> 01:39:09.710 region:rollup2
APPROVED IN BUT MEDICAL

01:39:08.576 --> 01:39:10.611 region:rollup2
TREATMENTS ARE BEING DELAYED

01:39:09.710 --> 01:39:12.847 region:rollup2
DENIED IT STUFF THAT WE REALLY

01:39:10.611 --> 01:39:14.048 region:rollup2
NEED. THE INJURED WORKER TO READ

01:39:12.847 --> 01:39:16.117 region:rollup2
SO THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING

01:39:14.048 --> 01:39:17.084 region:rollup2
ON IN THEIR CLAIM. I THINK FROM

01:39:16.117 --> 01:39:18.319 region:rollup2
THE EMPLOYER PERSPECTIVE WE

01:39:17.084 --> 01:39:19.287 region:rollup2
WOULD BE CONCERNED THAT SENDING

01:39:18.319 --> 01:39:21.823 region:rollup2
THEM A WHOLE FLOOD OF

01:39:19.287 --> 01:39:22.457 region:rollup2
INFORMATION THAT CAUSES THEM TO

01:39:21.823 --> 01:39:22.957 region:rollup2
SEE AN ENVELOPE WITH OUR NAME ON

01:39:22.457 --> 01:39:24.492 region:rollup2
IT.

01:39:22.957 --> 01:39:26.027 region:rollup2
AND THEN THROW IT AWAY BECAUSE

01:39:24.492 --> 01:39:27.695 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T WANT TO READ IT.

01:39:26.027 --> 01:39:28.996 region:rollup2
PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE WE NEED THEM

01:39:27.695 --> 01:39:30.998 region:rollup2
TO OPEN OUR MAIL AND WE NEED

01:39:28.996 --> 01:39:32.166 region:rollup2
THEM TO TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S

01:39:30.998 --> 01:39:32.834 region:rollup2
GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT IN THEIR

01:39:32.166 --> 01:39:35.069 region:rollup2
CLAIM.

01:39:32.834 --> 01:39:36.003 region:rollup2
EH IT IMPROVES JUST THE

01:39:35.069 --> 01:39:38.172 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONALITY OF THE SYSTEM

01:39:36.003 --> 01:39:39.674 region:rollup2
OVERALL AND AND SELFISHLY FOR

01:39:38.172 --> 01:39:41.542 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS IT HELPS AVOID

01:39:39.674 --> 01:39:42.977 region:rollup2
LITIGATION THAT IS ALMOST ALWAYS

01:39:41.542 --> 01:39:45.446 region:rollup2
A COST DRIVER IN THE SYSTEM.

01:39:42.977 --> 01:39:46.347 region:rollup2
SO WHILE WE UNDERSTAND THERE

01:39:45.446 --> 01:39:47.415 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE SOME BENEFIT THERE IN

01:39:46.347 --> 01:39:48.950 region:rollup2
SOME SITUATIONS I THINK WE

01:39:47.415 --> 01:39:50.985 region:rollup2
PREFER TO LEAVE.

01:39:48.950 --> 01:39:52.887 region:rollup2
THE STATUS QUO WHICH IS A LOT OF

01:39:50.985 --> 01:39:54.489 region:rollup2
CLAIMS OFFICES RIGHT NOW ALREADY

01:39:52.887 --> 01:39:55.923 region:rollup2
DO THIS ON A TARGETED BASIS.

01:39:54.489 --> 01:39:58.359 region:rollup2
WHERE THERE'S A PROVIDER?

01:39:55.923 --> 01:40:00.194 region:rollup2
OR AN AREA OF MEDICAL TREATMENT

01:39:58.359 --> 01:40:01.229 region:rollup2
OR SERVICES WHERE WE KNOW THERE

01:40:00.194 --> 01:40:03.264 region:rollup2
TO BE PROBLEMS.

01:40:01.229 --> 01:40:05.333 region:rollup2
SO.

01:40:03.264 --> 01:40:06.901 region:rollup2
I I THINK STATUS QUO'S OKAY.

01:40:05.333 --> 01:40:08.703 region:rollup2
WOULD BE EXTENSIVE TALKS TO HOW

01:40:06.901 --> 01:40:10.371 region:rollup2
WE CAN DO BETTER OBVIOUSLY OF

01:40:08.703 --> 01:40:12.073 region:rollup2
BUT WE DO HAVE THIS FEDERAL

01:40:10.371 --> 01:40:13.741 region:rollup2
CONCERNED ABOUT.

01:40:12.073 --> 01:40:16.177 region:rollup2
KIND OF FLOODING INJURED WORKERS

01:40:13.741 --> 01:40:18.012 region:rollup2
WITH A INFORMATION.

01:40:16.177 --> 01:40:20.281 region:rollup2
I OF THOSE ARE VERY INTERESTING

01:40:18.012 --> 01:40:21.716 region:rollup2
POINTS AND I'M GONNA ASK.

01:40:20.281 --> 01:40:23.384 region:rollup2
.

01:40:21.716 --> 01:40:23.885 region:rollup2

EXAMPLES.

01:40:25.887 --> 01:40:29.423 region:rollup2
.

01:40:27.622 --> 01:40:32.593 region:rollup2
WHAT PROMPTS THE SENDING OF

01:40:29.423 --> 01:40:35.630 region:rollup2
THOSE NOTICES IN SOME CASES?

01:40:32.593 --> 01:40:36.898 region:rollup2
BY SOME COMPANIES JR. AND DOM.

01:40:35.630 --> 01:40:38.1000 region:rollup2
NEVER.

01:40:36.898 --> 01:40:41.936 region:rollup2
MORE MAIL AND MORE

01:40:38.1000 --> 01:40:43.871 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATION DOESN'T ALWAYS.

01:40:41.936 --> 01:40:45.106 region:rollup2
RESULT IN BETTER COMMUNICATION

01:40:43.871 --> 01:40:47.875 region:rollup2
OR.

01:40:47.875 --> 01:40:51.412 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT

01:40:49.610 --> 01:40:53.848 region:rollup2

01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:30.591 region:rollup2

POINTS HERE. AND WE UNDERSTAND

01:45:30.591 --> 01:45:33.294 region:rollup2
THAT IF WE'RE TRULY GOING

PAYMENTS.

01:45:47.975 --> 01:45:51.245 region:rollup2
AND COLLECTIVELY WE HAVE THE

01:45:50.044 --> 01:45:52.780 region:rollup2
MOST SYSTEM DATA.

01:45:51.245 --> 01:45:54.315 region:rollup2

01:45:52.780 --> 01:45:54.882 region:rollup2
RECENTLY AND YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT

01:45:54.315 --> 01:45:55.983 region:rollup2
USE THAT I READ ABOUT IN THE

AND THE AUDITOR PRESENTED ON

01:45:57.618 --> 01:46:00.487 region:rollup2
THIS FACT AND CERTAINLY CDI IT

01:45:59.353 --> 01:46:01.822 region:rollup2
SPOKEN TO IT THERE'S A RESOURCE

01:46:00.487 --> 01:46:03.357 region:rollup2
LIMITATION.

01:46:01.822 --> 01:46:05.526 region:rollup2

CASES THAT CAN BE PROSECUTED.

01:46:09.330 --> 01:46:12.366 region:rollup2
AND AND I THINK AN EXAMPLE THAT

01:46:11.198 --> 01:46:13.934 region:rollup2
IS IT IS A RECENT ONE DOWN AND

01:46:12.366 --> 01:46:15.936 region:rollup2

01:46:31.418 --> 01:46:34.788 region:rollup2
FOUND A MASSIVE.

01:46:32.586 --> 01:46:36.957 region:rollup2
WELL ITS WAS A MASSIVE SCHEME

01:46:34.788 --> 01:46:38.125 region:rollup2
BY TEN ATTORNEYS AND A NUMBER OF

RUNNERS IN CAPPERS.

01:46:38.125 --> 01:46:41.128 region:rollup2
THIS SCHEME RESULTS IN OVER

01:46:39.727 --> 01:46:42.129 region:rollup2
THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN

THOUSAND PATIENTS CERTAINLY NOT

ALL OF THAT WAS FRAUDULENT.

01:46:46.467 --> 01:46:51.905 region:rollup2
BUT IT DOES SPEAK TO THE SCOPE.

01:46:49.370 --> 01:46:52.172 region:rollup2
OF OF OF HOW BIG THE SCHEMES

WE COMMEND DR FOR ITS

01:47:39.687 --> 01:47:42.623 region:rollup2

01:48:58.665 --> 01:49:03.070 region:rollup2
AND PROSECUTORS OR YOU HAVE W.

01:49:00.634 --> 01:49:04.705 region:rollup2
CA BE. OF JUDGES WHO ARE FORCING

01:49:03.070 --> 01:49:06.306 region:rollup2
YOU TO GO OUT AND SETTLE A CLAIM

01:49:04.705 --> 01:49:06.840 region:rollup2
THAT YOU THINK IS FRAUDULENT OR

01:49:06.306 --> 01:49:07.541 region:rollup2
PAYMENT THAT YOU THINK IS

01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:10.344 region:rollup2
FRAUDULENT.

01:49:07.541 --> 01:49:12.479 region:rollup2
LEADS INSURERS TO USE RESOURCES

01:49:10.344 --> 01:49:13.947 region:rollup2
ELSEWHERE AND FRANKLY FOCUS ON

01:49:12.479 --> 01:49:14.948 region:rollup2
THE BIG SYSTEMIC FRAUD. ON TO

01:49:13.947 --> 01:49:16.817 region:rollup2
TRY TO GET.

01:49:14.948 --> 01:49:19.119 region:rollup2
BANG FOR THE BUCK.

01:49:16.817 --> 01:49:20.654 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S I YOU KNOW I I I I

01:49:19.119 --> 01:49:21.255 region:rollup2
THINK THAT IF WE JUST GO AFTER

01:49:20.654 --> 01:49:22.389 region:rollup2
INCREASED VOLUME THE QUESTION

01:49:21.255 --> 01:49:24.191 region:rollup2
FOR

01:49:22.389 --> 01:49:25.359 region:rollup2
INSURERS BECOMES OKAY. OUT OF

01:49:24.191 --> 01:49:26.460 region:rollup2
CHRIS OUR VOLUME OF THE

01:49:25.359 --> 01:49:29.063 region:rollup2
REFERRALS WHAT IS GOING TO

01:49:26.460 --> 01:49:29.630 region:rollup2
HAPPEN BECAUSE AS OF RIGHT NOW

01:49:29.063 --> 01:49:30.431 region:rollup2
WE CAN'T HANDLE THE CURRENT

01:49:29.630 --> 01:49:32.166 region:rollup2
VOLUME.

01:49:30.431 --> 01:49:33.901 region:rollup2
AND THEN I WILL.

01:49:32.166 --> 01:49:34.802 region:rollup2
BRIEFLY COMMENT ON THAT THE E.

01:49:33.901 --> 01:49:36.437 region:rollup2
OBI'S.

01:49:34.802 --> 01:49:37.738 region:rollup2
I I THINK I WOULD.

01:49:36.437 --> 01:49:39.039 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATE MCOMMERCE WITH MR

01:49:37.738 --> 01:49:40.674 region:rollup2
SCHMELZER.

01:49:39.039 --> 01:49:42.376 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD ASSOCIATE.

01:49:40.674 --> 01:49:44.078 region:rollup2
SO MY COMMENTS AT THE DIAZ

01:49:42.376 --> 01:49:45.446 region:rollup2
RESPONSE AUDIO BEES.

01:49:44.078 --> 01:49:46.680 region:rollup2
I'M NOT SURE THAT THEY'RE

01:49:45.446 --> 01:49:48.615 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE TO A WORKERS

01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:50.150 region:rollup2
COMPENSATION SYSTEM WHERE A BE

01:49:48.615 --> 01:49:52.119 region:rollup2
INJURED WORKERS A WITNESS BUT

01:49:50.150 --> 01:49:53.253 region:rollup2
NOT THE VICTIM AND OTHER TYPE OF

01:49:52.119 --> 01:49:54.321 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE'S

01:49:53.253 --> 01:49:55.422 region:rollup2
SET UPS. THERE THE PEOPLE THEY

01:49:54.321 --> 01:49:57.057 region:rollup2
HAVE SKIN IN THE GAME RIGHT IN

01:49:55.422 --> 01:49:58.759 region:rollup2
WORKERS COMP THERE'S NO BUT THEY

01:49:57.057 --> 01:49:59.960 region:rollup2
DO NOT PAY FOR.

01:49:58.759 --> 01:50:01.462 region:rollup2
THEY DO NOT PAY FOR THEIR

01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:03.564 region:rollup2
MEDICAL CARE AND SO THEY ARE

01:50:01.462 --> 01:50:05.232 region:rollup2
OFTEN I'M NOT GOING TO BE AWARE

01:50:03.564 --> 01:50:06.667 region:rollup2
OR IS INVESTED. AMEND THAT I

01:50:05.232 --> 01:50:07.801 region:rollup2
THINK THE SECOND POINT IS YOU

01:50:06.667 --> 01:50:09.269 region:rollup2
LOOK AT OFTEN WHERE THIS

01:50:07.801 --> 01:50:10.637 region:rollup2
SYSTEMIC FRAUD IS COMING FROM

01:50:09.269 --> 01:50:12.406 region:rollup2
IT'S COMING FROM SITUATIONS

01:50:10.637 --> 01:50:13.273 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY'RE DENIED CLAIMS SO

01:50:12.406 --> 01:50:15.609 region:rollup2
THERE ARE.

01:50:13.273 --> 01:50:17.044 region:rollup2
THERE'S A TREATMENT THAT WE ARE

01:50:15.609 --> 01:50:18.312 region:rollup2
AWARE OF SAID THERE'D BE NO

01:50:17.044 --> 01:50:20.714 region:rollup2
YOU'LL BE TO SEND.

01:50:18.312 --> 01:50:22.916 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE SUGGESTION THAT IF

01:50:20.714 --> 01:50:23.851 region:rollup2
WE'RE PERIODICALLY JUST SENDING

01:50:22.916 --> 01:50:24.118 region:rollup2
OUT ANY OB.

01:50:23.851 --> 01:50:25.586 region:rollup2
PERHAPS.

01:50:24.118 --> 01:50:27.154 region:rollup2
TRIGGERS OR THEY HEARD THEIR

01:50:25.586 --> 01:50:28.322 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIERS THAT WOULD ALLOW US

01:50:27.154 --> 01:50:29.590 region:rollup2
TO KNOW WHEN FRAUD IS MORE

01:50:28.322 --> 01:50:30.557 region:rollup2
LIKELY AND WE COULD WE COULD

01:50:29.590 --> 01:50:31.825 region:rollup2
SEND THAT OUT BUT WHEN YOU'RE

01:50:30.557 --> 01:50:33.227 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT SYSTEMIC FRAUD YOU

01:50:31.825 --> 01:50:34.161 region:rollup2
GOTTA BE LOOKING FOR PATTERNS.

01:50:33.227 --> 01:50:35.729 region:rollup2
YOU GOTTA BE LOOKING FOR BIG

01:50:34.161 --> 01:50:38.132 region:rollup2
DATA I GUESS THE QUESTION

01:50:35.729 --> 01:50:39.633 region:rollup2
BECOMES HOW WOULD A. AROUND.

01:50:38.132 --> 01:50:41.502 region:rollup2
A EIGHTY PERIODIC YOU'LL BE

01:50:39.633 --> 01:50:43.070 region:rollup2
GOING OUT BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN

01:50:41.502 --> 01:50:44.271 region:rollup2
THE ANALYTICS THE WE'RE PUTTING

01:50:43.070 --> 01:50:45.873 region:rollup2
IN PLACE THAT THAT THAT THE

01:50:44.271 --> 01:50:47.975 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS OF DATA THAT WERE

01:50:45.873 --> 01:50:49.776 region:rollup2
TURNING OVER THE DIR AND YOU W.

01:50:47.975 --> 01:50:52.179 region:rollup2
C. ARE WORKING ON I THINK. WHEN

01:50:49.776 --> 01:50:53.313 region:rollup2
WE TALK ABOUT PROVIDER FRAUD IN

01:50:52.179 --> 01:50:54.214 region:rollup2
SOME OF THESE BIG SCHEMES THAT'S

01:50:53.313 --> 01:50:56.116 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE A MUCH MORE

01:50:54.214 --> 01:50:57.651 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE TOOL ON THEN TO MISTER

01:50:56.116 --> 01:50:59.586 region:rollup2
SMELTERS POINT THROWING OUT

01:50:57.651 --> 01:51:01.555 region:rollup2
ANOTHER NOTICE SO. I'M WITH THAT

01:50:59.586 --> 01:51:02.122 region:rollup2
I WILL CONCLUDE MY TESTIMONY

01:51:01.555 --> 01:51:02.990 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY AVAILABLE FOR ANY

01:51:02.122 --> 01:51:08.061 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS.

01:51:02.990 --> 01:51:08.695 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR COMMENTING ON THE.

01:51:08.061 --> 01:51:09.163 region:rollup2
QUESTION ABOUT REFERRALS OF THE

01:51:08.695 --> 01:51:10.797 region:rollup2
ISSUE OF REFERRALS.

01:51:09.163 --> 01:51:11.131 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S STILL KIND OF AN

01:51:10.797 --> 01:51:13.033 region:rollup2
OPEN QUESTION.

01:51:11.131 --> 01:51:13.767 region:rollup2
.

01:51:13.033 --> 01:51:16.169 region:rollup2
YOUR EXPLANATION.

01:51:13.767 --> 01:51:18.739 region:rollup2
OR AND PERSPECTIVE IS.

01:51:16.169 --> 01:51:20.407 region:rollup2
SOUNDS VERY PLAUSIBLE AND

01:51:18.739 --> 01:51:21.909 region:rollup2
REASONABLE.

01:51:20.407 --> 01:51:22.409 region:rollup2
ON THE OTHER HAND.

01:51:21.909 --> 01:51:24.444 region:rollup2
THIS IS.

01:51:22.409 --> 01:51:25.546 region:rollup2
IT'S A REFERRAL BASED SYSTEM

01:51:24.444 --> 01:51:26.513 region:rollup2
IT'S SO YOU KNOW OF A CLAIMS

01:51:25.546 --> 01:51:28.515 region:rollup2
BASED.

01:51:26.513 --> 01:51:31.818 region:rollup2
SYSTEM OR.

01:51:28.515 --> 01:51:33.921 region:rollup2
IN SO FOR LARGE COMPANIES TO.

01:51:31.818 --> 01:51:36.223 region:rollup2
TWO NOT REFER AT ALL IN SOME

01:51:33.921 --> 01:51:38.091 region:rollup2
YEARS.

01:51:36.223 --> 01:51:39.993 region:rollup2
HIS SARAM IMMINENT IT'S

01:51:38.091 --> 01:51:41.495 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANTIAL AND IT'S IT'S

01:51:39.993 --> 01:51:42.930 region:rollup2
LIKE IT'S LIKE IT'S LIKE.

01:51:41.495 --> 01:51:44.998 region:rollup2
DISPROVING A NEGATIVE I SUPPOSE

01:51:42.930 --> 01:51:46.166 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:51:44.998 --> 01:51:47.901 region:rollup2
IN MY MIND STILL A BIT OF AN

01:51:46.166 --> 01:51:49.303 region:rollup2
OPEN QUESTION IN A.

01:51:47.901 --> 01:51:50.637 region:rollup2
AND WE JUST SAT DISCONNECT TO

01:51:49.303 --> 01:51:51.772 region:rollup2
KEEP FOCUSED ON THAT I THINK

01:51:50.637 --> 01:51:53.640 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY REASONABLE TO BRING IT

01:51:51.772 --> 01:51:55.108 region:rollup2
UP IN THE AUDIT.

01:51:53.640 --> 01:51:58.445 region:rollup2
AND YOUR RESPONSE.

01:51:55.108 --> 01:52:00.147 region:rollup2
ON BEHALF OF THE INSURERS NAM.

01:51:58.445 --> 01:52:02.482 region:rollup2
AS I SAID IS PLAUSIBLE.

01:52:00.147 --> 01:52:04.017 region:rollup2
AND YET.

01:52:02.482 --> 01:52:06.086 region:rollup2
NOT SURE IT ANSWERS IT AN

01:52:04.017 --> 01:52:07.788 region:rollup2
ENTIRELY IN SO LITTLE IN IT WE

01:52:06.086 --> 01:52:09.056 region:rollup2
JUST HAVE TO STAY FOCUSED ON

01:52:07.788 --> 01:52:10.891 region:rollup2
THAT MOISTURE IF I COMMENT.

01:52:09.056 --> 01:52:11.892 region:rollup2
SURE NO I MAY THINK IT'S I

01:52:10.891 --> 01:52:13.226 region:rollup2
THINK THAT'S RIGHT AND I THINK

01:52:11.892 --> 01:52:15.028 region:rollup2
IT'S DONE WELL CERTAINLY LOOKING

01:52:13.226 --> 01:52:16.096 region:rollup2
INTO IT ZERO REFERRALS AND AND

01:52:15.028 --> 01:52:17.564 region:rollup2
SOME OF THAT DATA IS IS

01:52:16.096 --> 01:52:18.498 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY EYE OPENING. WHAT I

01:52:17.564 --> 01:52:20.267 region:rollup2
SHOULDA SAID IS THE LACK OF

01:52:18.498 --> 01:52:22.669 region:rollup2
RESOURCES ON THE RECEIVING END

01:52:20.267 --> 01:52:24.571 region:rollup2
IS NOT REALLY TO ME A REASON

01:52:22.669 --> 01:52:25.806 region:rollup2
IT'S LIKE IT'S LIKE?

01:52:24.571 --> 01:52:27.708 region:rollup2
NO LONGER CALLING THE LOCAL

01:52:25.806 --> 01:52:29.543 region:rollup2
POLICE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE THE

01:52:27.708 --> 01:52:32.112 region:rollup2
RESPONSE TIMES ARE GOOD ENOUGH.

01:52:29.543 --> 01:52:33.380 region:rollup2
I KNOW IT IS THE IT'S IT'S LIKE

01:52:32.112 --> 01:52:34.414 region:rollup2
WHICH IS IT SO I JUST.

01:52:33.380 --> 01:52:35.215 region:rollup2
PUT THAT OUT THERE FOR THE GOOD

01:52:34.414 --> 01:52:37.751 region:rollup2
OF THE ORDER BECAUSE WE'RE

01:52:35.215 --> 01:52:39.753 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT A A.

01:52:37.751 --> 01:52:42.656 region:rollup2
SOME CONCEPTUAL A CONCEPTUAL

01:52:39.753 --> 01:52:44.658 region:rollup2
AREA AND THEN THE ACTUAL REAL.

01:52:42.656 --> 01:52:46.293 region:rollup2
PRACTICAL AREA.

01:52:44.658 --> 01:52:47.094 region:rollup2
SO DID IF THE INSURANCE THE

01:52:46.293 --> 01:52:49.029 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF.

01:52:47.094 --> 01:52:50.597 region:rollup2
.

01:52:49.029 --> 01:52:52.232 region:rollup2
THE BEEFS UP ITS INVESTIGATIVE

01:52:50.597 --> 01:52:53.667 region:rollup2
STAFF AND SOLVE SOME OF THOSE

01:52:52.232 --> 01:52:54.267 region:rollup2
ISSUES MAYBE THE INSURANCE

01:52:53.667 --> 01:52:55.869 region:rollup2
COMPANIES WILL BE A LITTLE BIT

01:52:54.267 --> 01:52:58.171 region:rollup2
MORE.

01:52:55.869 --> 01:52:59.906 region:rollup2
WILLING TO REFER THOSE MARGINAL

01:52:58.171 --> 01:53:01.508 region:rollup2
CASES. AND CERTAIN THAT IN ORDER

01:52:59.906 --> 01:53:03.276 region:rollup2
REFER YEAH WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION

01:53:01.508 --> 01:53:04.778 region:rollup2
TO DO SO AND I UNDERSTAND THAT

01:53:03.276 --> 01:53:06.580 region:rollup2
AND AND AND JUST LOOKING AT THE

01:53:04.778 --> 01:53:08.515 region:rollup2
DATA YEAH I I KNOW THAT TALKING

01:53:06.580 --> 01:53:09.750 region:rollup2
MY GUYS IT SEEMS TO BE MORE

01:53:08.515 --> 01:53:11.051 region:rollup2
VAGUE FOCUS ON.

01:53:09.750 --> 01:53:12.619 region:rollup2
OKAY WHAT CASES ARE THE

01:53:11.051 --> 01:53:13.787 region:rollup2
PROSECUTORS WORK WE FOCUS IS

01:53:12.619 --> 01:53:15.289 region:rollup2
ALSO AND IT'S A COST THERE'S

01:53:13.787 --> 01:53:16.823 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY BUT NO TO YOUR POINT

01:53:15.289 --> 01:53:17.624 region:rollup2
THOUGH I MEAN CERTAINLY WE WE DO

01:53:16.823 --> 01:53:18.892 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHERE THERE IS A

01:53:17.624 --> 01:53:19.493 region:rollup2
REASONABLE SUSPICION WE HAVE

01:53:18.892 --> 01:53:20.527 region:rollup2
THAT OBLIGATION AND CERTAINLY

01:53:19.493 --> 01:53:21.528 region:rollup2
WE.

01:53:20.527 --> 01:53:22.529 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW TO EXTEND OR NOT WE

01:53:21.528 --> 01:53:25.098 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE DOING A BETTER JOB OF

01:53:22.529 --> 01:53:26.667 region:rollup2
REFERRING THOSE YOUR POINTS VERY

01:53:25.098 --> 01:53:27.968 region:rollup2
WELL TAKEN SIR.

01:53:26.667 --> 01:53:29.102 region:rollup2
MISTER COOLEY DID YOU A QUSTION

YEAH PLEASURE TO MAKE

01:53:29.102 --> 01:53:32.039 region:rollup2
OBSERVATION THAT.

01:53:30.437 --> 01:53:33.206 region:rollup2
IN THIS AREA THE ONE THING THE

01:53:32.039 --> 01:53:34.841 region:rollup2
INSURERS WILL ALWAYS NEED TO

01:53:33.206 --> 01:53:35.909 region:rollup2
KEEP MINE IS IT'S IN THE.

01:53:34.841 --> 01:53:37.411 region:rollup2
THIS ALL PLAYS OUT THE PUBLIC

01:53:35.909 --> 01:53:38.679 region:rollup2
REALM.

01:53:37.411 --> 01:53:40.314 region:rollup2
PERIODICALLY WE GO TO THE

01:53:38.679 --> 01:53:41.615 region:rollup2
WORKERS COMP CYCLE.

01:53:40.314 --> 01:53:42.582 region:rollup2
AND THEN THAT GETS RESOLVED

01:53:41.615 --> 01:53:44.251 region:rollup2
WE'RE WHERE HOW PEOPLE VIEW THE

01:53:42.582 --> 01:53:45.852 region:rollup2
EQUITIES.

01:53:44.251 --> 01:53:46.887 region:rollup2
TRADITIONALLY I MEAN THIS GOES

01:53:45.852 --> 01:53:48.655 region:rollup2
BACK A LONG LONG TIME.

01:53:46.887 --> 01:53:50.590 region:rollup2
DID THE.

01:53:48.655 --> 01:53:52.292 region:rollup2
THE HIT ON THEINSURERS IS THAT

01:53:50.590 --> 01:53:54.127 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T NECESSARILY PURSUE

01:53:52.292 --> 01:53:55.162 region:rollup2
FRAUD AGGRESSIVELY.

01:53:54.127 --> 01:53:56.329 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU'LL GET IT BACK IN

01:53:55.162 --> 01:53:58.965 region:rollup2
THE RATE.

01:53:56.329 --> 01:54:01.001 region:rollup2
SO.

01:53:58.965 --> 01:54:02.769 region:rollup2
I THINK IT IS.

01:54:01.001 --> 01:54:04.404 region:rollup2
BENEFICIAL TO INSURERS TO JUST

01:54:02.769 --> 01:54:07.607 region:rollup2
ALWAYS LOOKING DOWN THE TRAIL TO

01:54:04.404 --> 01:54:07.607 region:rollup2
THESE PUBLIC DEBATES YOU'LL.

01:54:07.674 --> 01:54:11.845 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE EXHIBITING

01:54:09.076 --> 01:54:13.714 region:rollup2
AGGRESSIVENESS AND REPORTING.

01:54:11.845 --> 01:54:15.482 region:rollup2
BECAUSE SOMEBODY WILL MODEL

01:54:13.714 --> 01:54:17.217 region:rollup2
WANNA MAKE THAT ASSERTION.

01:54:15.482 --> 01:54:19.519 region:rollup2
I MEAN I CAN THINK BACK FIFTEEN

01:54:17.217 --> 01:54:21.455 region:rollup2
TWENTY YEARS WHEN THAT.

01:54:19.519 --> 01:54:22.756 region:rollup2
SPECTER BECAME EXPRESSED IN

01:54:21.455 --> 01:54:24.324 region:rollup2
REPORTS THAT THEN GET IN THE

01:54:22.756 --> 01:54:27.027 region:rollup2
PUBLIC REALM.

01:54:24.324 --> 01:54:28.862 region:rollup2
A AND IT'S AN EASY HIT TO MAKE

01:54:27.027 --> 01:54:30.464 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT SORT OF PEOPLE OFTEN

01:54:28.862 --> 01:54:32.733 region:rollup2
HAVE WHATEVER THE LINE OF

01:54:30.464 --> 01:54:34.501 region:rollup2
INSURANCE NEGATIVE STEREOTYPES

01:54:32.733 --> 01:54:37.037 region:rollup2
REGARDING. INSURERS

01:54:34.501 --> 01:54:38.138 region:rollup2
SO I THINK ARE TO BE AGGRESSIVE

01:54:37.037 --> 01:54:39.973 region:rollup2
IN PURSUING REPORTS AND

01:54:38.138 --> 01:54:41.908 region:rollup2
TENDERING THEM IRRESPECTIVE.

01:54:39.973 --> 01:54:43.076 region:rollup2
DOES START PUTTING THE.

01:54:41.908 --> 01:54:44.578 region:rollup2
PRESSURE ON ANOTHER PARTY IN

01:54:43.076 --> 01:54:46.213 region:rollup2
THIS SYSTEM

01:54:44.578 --> 01:54:47.981 region:rollup2
TO BE ACTIVE AND SORT OF

01:54:46.213 --> 01:54:50.050 region:rollup2
SAFEGUARDS INSURANCE.

01:54:47.981 --> 01:54:51.785 region:rollup2
REPUTATION IN THE WHOLE DIALOGUE

01:54:50.050 --> 01:54:52.586 region:rollup2
WHICH DOES PLAY INTO.

01:54:51.785 --> 01:54:53.353 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THOSE PERIODIC

01:54:52.586 --> 01:54:57.524 region:rollup2
DEBATES WE

01:54:53.353 --> 01:54:58.825 region:rollup2
SELL.

01:54:57.524 --> 01:55:00.394 region:rollup2

LONG EFFORT ON FRAUD AND I WANT

01:55:19.079 --> 01:55:22.215 region:rollup2
TO. REMIND SO THAT THAT STAFF

01:55:21.081 --> 01:55:24.317 region:rollup2
KNOWS THAT FRAUD IS NOT ONLY

01:55:22.215 --> 01:55:25.652 region:rollup2

SURGERIES.

01:55:28.188 --> 01:55:31.558 region:rollup2
FOR OTHER ISSUES WHERE THE FRAUD

01:55:29.956 --> 01:55:32.092 region:rollup2
HAS ONLY BENEFITED THE PRIVATE

CHARTS INDUSTRY IN THAT'S LONGER

01:55:36.663 --> 01:55:38.665 region:rollup2
THAN I'D LIKE TO ADMIT I'VE

01:55:37.764 --> 01:55:41.168 region:rollup2
ALWAYS HEARD MY COMPANIES

01:55:38.665 --> 01:55:43.103 region:rollup2
COMPLAIN ABOUT THE GIFT WRAPPED

01:55:41.168 --> 01:55:44.504 region:rollup2
CASES A GIVEN THE DOI. AND DO

01:55:43.103 --> 01:55:45.872 region:rollup2
AYE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING THAT YOU

01:55:44.504 --> 01:55:48.008 region:rollup2
TALK TO THE DR Y. THEY SAY WELL

01:55:45.872 --> 01:55:48.341 region:rollup2
THAT STUFF YOU GIVEN US IS NOT

01:55:48.008 --> 01:55:49.242 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE.

01:55:48.341 --> 01:55:51.144 region:rollup2
SO LAST.

01:55:49.242 --> 01:55:52.779 region:rollup2
YEAR WE ACTUALLY SET UP A

01:55:51.144 --> 01:55:54.247 region:rollup2
MEETING WITH THE DO Y. AND THE

01:55:52.779 --> 01:55:56.983 region:rollup2
INSURERS WHICH ACTUALLY ENDED UP

01:55:54.247 --> 01:55:58.418 region:rollup2
IN A THINK A VERY GOOD WORKSHOP.

01:55:56.983 --> 01:55:59.786 region:rollup2
DRIVE BRIDGE THIS GAP.

01:55:58.418 --> 01:56:01.321 region:rollup2
AND SEVERAL THINGS CAME OUT OF

01:55:59.786 --> 01:56:01.888 region:rollup2
IT WHICH I THINK ARE IMPORTANT

01:56:01.321 --> 01:56:03.523 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE

01:56:01.888 --> 01:56:04.724 region:rollup2
BROUGHT UP IN THE AUDIT.

01:56:03.523 --> 01:56:06.760 region:rollup2
A DEAL I WAS FRUSTRATED BECAUSE

01:56:04.724 --> 01:56:07.961 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE STAFF IN ISSUES.

01:56:06.760 --> 01:56:09.496 region:rollup2
THEY WANT A FIGHT FRAUD THEY

01:56:07.961 --> 01:56:10.797 region:rollup2
WANTED OF THE TOOLS TO DO THAT

01:56:09.496 --> 01:56:12.599 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO SUPPORT THAT.

01:56:10.797 --> 01:56:14.201 region:rollup2
ANOTHER THING THAT CAME UP THAT

01:56:12.599 --> 01:56:16.670 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY SPEAKS TO THE AUDITOR'S

01:56:14.201 --> 01:56:18.305 region:rollup2
COMMENT ON REPORTS OF IS. THEY

01:56:16.670 --> 01:56:19.773 region:rollup2
DON'T WANT US JUST TO SEND THE

01:56:18.305 --> 01:56:21.541 region:rollup2
REPORT BECAUSE OF HIM IN THAT

01:56:19.773 --> 01:56:24.044 region:rollup2
SIXTY DAY PERIOD BECAUSE THEY

01:56:21.541 --> 01:56:25.846 region:rollup2
DON'T IT'S NOT HELPFUL FOR THEM.

01:56:24.044 --> 01:56:27.280 region:rollup2
BICU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL TO

01:56:25.846 --> 01:56:28.448 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT THE MATERIAL

01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:29.282 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GETTING THAT'S GONNA BE

01:56:28.448 --> 01:56:30.784 region:rollup2
IN THIS REPORT IS ACTUALLY

01:56:29.282 --> 01:56:32.786 region:rollup2
REFLECTIVE.

01:56:30.784 --> 01:56:33.854 region:rollup2
OFTENTIMES WHAT IS MORE HELPFUL

01:56:32.786 --> 01:56:35.889 region:rollup2
IN THIS REQUIRES HELP WITH THE

01:56:33.854 --> 01:56:37.591 region:rollup2
DA'S. IS TO GET THE MATERIAL

01:56:35.889 --> 01:56:38.625 region:rollup2
THAT GOES BEYOND MERE SUSPICION

01:56:37.591 --> 01:56:40.160 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OFTENTIMES MAYOR

01:56:38.625 --> 01:56:41.361 region:rollup2
SUSPICIONS INVESTIGATED AND

01:56:40.160 --> 01:56:42.662 region:rollup2
NOTHING HAPPENS YOU DON'T WANT

01:56:41.361 --> 01:56:44.231 region:rollup2
THAT MATERIAL REPORTED BECAUSE

01:56:42.662 --> 01:56:45.565 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT HELPFUL. BUT WHAT

01:56:44.231 --> 01:56:46.633 region:rollup2
WOULD BE A GOOD WAY TO JUDGE

01:56:45.565 --> 01:56:48.001 region:rollup2
COMPANIES POSSIBLY ON THOSE

01:56:46.633 --> 01:56:49.236 region:rollup2
KINDS OF CASES THAT ARE TAKEN BY

01:56:48.001 --> 01:56:51.404 region:rollup2
THE DA'S ON THAT ARE ACTUALLY

01:56:49.236 --> 01:56:52.439 region:rollup2
PROSECUTED. ONE OF OUR COMPANIES

01:56:51.404 --> 01:56:55.041 region:rollup2
WOULD TO DOESN'T FILE OUT OF

01:56:52.439 --> 01:56:56.042 region:rollup2
PLACES A GLUT CASES BUT THEY'RE

01:56:55.041 --> 01:56:56.943 region:rollup2
VERY ACTIVE FRAUD UNIT.

01:56:56.042 --> 01:56:58.278 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OTHER CASES

01:56:56.943 --> 01:56:59.379 region:rollup2
RESULT IN CONVICTIONS

01:56:58.278 --> 01:57:00.914 region:rollup2
SO THAT ACTUALLY MAY BE A MORE

01:56:59.379 --> 01:57:02.516 region:rollup2
ACCURATE SYSTEM.

01:57:00.914 --> 01:57:03.817 region:rollup2
ARE WE ALSO STRONGLY SUPPORT THE

01:57:02.516 --> 01:57:04.818 region:rollup2
EFFORTS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:57:03.817 --> 01:57:06.253 region:rollup2
DUSTER RELATIONS ON THE DATA

01:57:04.818 --> 01:57:07.821 region:rollup2
ANALYTICS.

01:57:06.253 --> 01:57:09.756 region:rollup2
WHAT MANY PEOPLE DON'T KNOW IS

01:57:07.821 --> 01:57:11.758 region:rollup2
THAT IN TWO THOUSAND THREE SOME

01:57:09.756 --> 01:57:13.026 region:rollup2
INSURERS KNEW ABOUT ROBOT AND

01:57:11.758 --> 01:57:14.361 region:rollup2
THE ISSUES OF PACIFIC HOSPITAL

01:57:13.026 --> 01:57:15.729 region:rollup2
BUT BECAUSE THEY ONLY KNOW ABOUT

01:57:14.361 --> 01:57:17.397 region:rollup2
THEIR SCOPE OF THE EXPOSURE IT

01:57:15.729 --> 01:57:19.666 region:rollup2
WAS NOT UNTIL MUCH LATER THAT IT

01:57:17.397 --> 01:57:21.067 region:rollup2
BECAME CLEAR? HOW BROAD THAT THE

01:57:19.666 --> 01:57:22.035 region:rollup2
ISSUE WAS SO I THINK WE THINK

01:57:21.067 --> 01:57:23.169 region:rollup2
THAT THE TOOLS

01:57:22.035 --> 01:57:24.804 region:rollup2
THE DE? IS PUTTING TOGETHER WILL

01:57:23.169 --> 01:57:26.273 region:rollup2
HELP THAT.

01:57:24.804 --> 01:57:27.107 region:rollup2
ONE MORE ISSUE I'D LIKE TO BRING

01:57:26.273 --> 01:57:28.875 region:rollup2
OUT THAT HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP

01:57:27.107 --> 01:57:30.076 region:rollup2
WHICH IS SEVERAL YEARS AGO THE

01:57:28.875 --> 01:57:31.811 region:rollup2
INSURANCE INDUSTRY PASSED

01:57:30.076 --> 01:57:34.547 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION TO TRIED SET UP A

01:57:31.811 --> 01:57:35.949 region:rollup2
ROUND TABLE. OF INSURERS AND DO

01:57:34.547 --> 01:57:37.450 region:rollup2
Y. SO WE COULD START TALKING

01:57:35.949 --> 01:57:39.886 region:rollup2
ABOUT TRENDS AND ISSUES AND

01:57:37.450 --> 01:57:41.254 region:rollup2
MAYBE START ANTICIPATING SOME OF

01:57:39.886 --> 01:57:42.722 region:rollup2
THESE ISSUES THAT WERE ST.

01:57:41.254 --> 01:57:43.723 region:rollup2
THAT WORKING GROUP AND WALLETS

01:57:42.722 --> 01:57:44.991 region:rollup2
AND STATURE IT IT'S NEVER BEEN

01:57:43.723 --> 01:57:46.560 region:rollup2
AFFECTED BECAUSE I THINK THE

01:57:44.991 --> 01:57:48.395 region:rollup2
STATUTE ITSELF NEEDS SOME MORE

01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:49.996 region:rollup2
WORK. AND I'D LIKE TO KIND OF

01:57:48.395 --> 01:57:51.531 region:rollup2
ENGAGE IN THAT EFFORT TO.

01:57:49.996 --> 01:57:52.933 region:rollup2
I'M HERE FOR ANY QUESTIONS THANK

01:57:51.531 --> 01:57:54.901 region:rollup2
YOU VERY MUCH ANY QUESTIONS FOR

01:57:52.933 --> 01:57:56.836 region:rollup2
MISTER SEGMENT.

01:57:54.901 --> 01:57:58.038 region:rollup2
MISS COBB HERO.

01:57:56.836 --> 01:58:00.106 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY I DON'T I DON'T HAVE A

01:57:58.038 --> 01:58:00.340 region:rollup2
QUESTION BUT I THINK THE IDEA OF

01:58:00.106 --> 01:58:02.108 region:rollup2
MEETING.

01:58:00.340 --> 01:58:04.010 region:rollup2
.

01:58:02.108 --> 01:58:05.178 region:rollup2
YEAH BUT KIND OF INVESTIGATOR TO

01:58:04.010 --> 01:58:06.613 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATOR IS IS REALLY A.

01:58:05.178 --> 01:58:08.081 region:rollup2
.

01:58:06.613 --> 01:58:10.083 region:rollup2
AND IT'S KIND OF ONE OF THOSE I

01:58:08.081 --> 01:58:10.650 region:rollup2
CAN AHEAD OF ME A MOMENT RIGHT

01:58:10.083 --> 01:58:12.252 region:rollup2
IT IT SOMETHING WITH BRYANT

01:58:10.650 --> 01:58:15.288 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:58:12.252 --> 01:58:17.457 region:rollup2
WELL IT IT IS BECAUSE HOW A CASE

01:58:15.288 --> 01:58:18.825 region:rollup2
GETS INVESTIGATED AND WHAT THAT

01:58:17.457 --> 01:58:20.360 region:rollup2
THE DATA THAT THAT THEN GETS

01:58:18.825 --> 01:58:21.661 region:rollup2
TRANSMITTED IS REALLY IMPORTANT

01:58:20.360 --> 01:58:23.063 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THINGS

01:58:21.661 --> 01:58:24.664 region:rollup2
FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE.

01:58:23.063 --> 01:58:26.266 region:rollup2
YOU'RE LIKELY THAT TO NOT MEET

01:58:24.664 --> 01:58:27.667 region:rollup2
IN THE MIDDLE SO I KNEW I AM I

01:58:26.266 --> 01:58:28.935 region:rollup2
WANT TO COMMEND THAT AND I

01:58:27.667 --> 01:58:31.204 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE

01:58:28.935 --> 01:58:31.871 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE BOTTOM LINE IS

01:58:31.204 --> 01:58:33.340 region:rollup2
YOU'RE OUT AFTER THE SAME THING.

01:58:31.871 --> 01:58:35.141 region:rollup2
YOU'RE TRYING TO CATCH.

01:58:33.340 --> 01:58:36.843 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT ARE TAKING

01:58:35.141 --> 01:58:38.611 region:rollup2
ADVANTAGE OF THE SYSTEM AND THAT

01:58:36.843 --> 01:58:39.913 region:rollup2
ARE DOING IT IN A WAY THAT THAT

01:58:38.611 --> 01:58:42.148 region:rollup2
IS RIPPING OFF THE SYSTEM AND

01:58:39.913 --> 01:58:43.249 region:rollup2
NOT THE. MONEY'S NOT GOING WHERE

01:58:42.148 --> 01:58:44.751 region:rollup2
IT'S SUPPOSED AGO SO CANNELLA

01:58:43.249 --> 01:58:45.785 region:rollup2
KURDISH APARTMENT TO CONTINUE TO

01:58:44.751 --> 01:58:46.720 region:rollup2
HAVE THOSE MEETINGS I THINK THE

01:58:45.785 --> 01:58:48.355 region:rollup2
FIRST ONE AT LEAST FOR THEIR

01:58:46.720 --> 01:58:49.122 region:rollup2
PART I GOT FROM MY MEMBERS WAS

01:58:48.355 --> 01:58:51.291 region:rollup2
VERY HELPFUL.

01:58:49.122 --> 01:58:52.792 region:rollup2
WELL I I I WOULD IMAGINE THAT IT

01:58:51.291 --> 01:58:54.260 region:rollup2
IS AND I WANNA.

01:58:52.792 --> 01:58:55.829 region:rollup2
AMEND THE GROUP FOR MEETING AND

01:58:54.260 --> 01:58:58.498 region:rollup2
HOPE HOPE THAT THAT WILL

01:58:55.829 --> 01:58:59.933 region:rollup2
CONTINUE INDEFINITELY AS AS THEY

01:58:58.498 --> 01:59:01.434 region:rollup2
WORK ON CASES STICK AS A WORK ON

01:58:59.933 --> 01:59:03.470 region:rollup2
THE METRICS OF HOW A CASE SHOULD

01:59:01.434 --> 01:59:05.872 region:rollup2
BE PREPARED. AND THEN YOU END UP

01:59:03.470 --> 01:59:07.407 region:rollup2
WITH ACTUAL A EITHER CONVICTIONS

01:59:05.872 --> 01:59:08.875 region:rollup2
OR UP.

01:59:07.407 --> 01:59:10.310 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENTS BACK TO THE

01:59:08.875 --> 01:59:12.479 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THAT'S GOING TO SHOW

01:59:10.310 --> 01:59:13.079 region:rollup2
THEIR THAT THE SYNERGY WITH THAT

01:59:12.479 --> 01:59:14.481 region:rollup2
GROUP SO I THINK IT'S A GREAT

PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO APART

02:05:35.128 --> 02:05:38.197 region:rollup2

MR SECONDS.

02:08:04.877 --> 02:08:10.550 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION ABOUT REPORTING. ARE

02:08:08.648 --> 02:08:11.651 region:rollup2
BY INSURANCE CARRIERS HA I THINK

02:08:10.550 --> 02:08:12.752 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK THAT THEY'RE DOING

02:08:11.651 --> 02:08:14.387 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY CAN I THINK IT'S

02:08:12.752 --> 02:08:15.421 region:rollup2
EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING WHEN YOU

02:08:14.387 --> 02:08:18.824 region:rollup2
GO THROUGH THE EFFORTS THAT THEY

02:08:15.421 --> 02:08:19.592 region:rollup2
DO. AND ARE FOR WHATEVER REASON

02:08:18.824 --> 02:08:20.526 region:rollup2
THEIR EFFORTS HERE SEEM TO BE

02:08:19.592 --> 02:08:22.228 region:rollup2
IGNORED.

02:08:20.526 --> 02:08:23.529 region:rollup2
BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT.

02:08:22.228 --> 02:08:26.098 region:rollup2
YOU MULTIPLY THAT BY THE

02:08:23.529 --> 02:08:27.700 region:rollup2
THOUSANDS OF INJURED WORKERS AND

02:08:26.098 --> 02:08:30.636 region:rollup2
HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS AND

02:08:27.700 --> 02:08:31.270 region:rollup2
THOUSANDS OF UP PROVIDERS WHO

02:08:30.636 --> 02:08:32.939 region:rollup2
COMPLAINED TO THE DIVISION OF

02:08:31.270 --> 02:08:35.274 region:rollup2
WORKERS COMPENSATION TO THEIR

02:08:32.939 --> 02:08:37.877 region:rollup2
AUDIT UNIT. AND OUR OUR NORD.

02:08:35.274 --> 02:08:40.112 region:rollup2
THAT WE WE KNOW THEIR PAIN IT'S

02:08:37.877 --> 02:08:41.614 region:rollup2
A LITTLE DIFFERENT BUT IT

02:08:40.112 --> 02:08:43.216 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY TOWARDS THE SAME END.

02:08:41.614 --> 02:08:44.717 region:rollup2
HA WITH RESPECT TO THE I'M NOT

02:08:43.216 --> 02:08:46.452 region:rollup2
SPENT RESOURCES.

02:08:44.717 --> 02:08:47.620 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THAT EVERY PENNY

02:08:46.452 --> 02:08:48.454 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE SPENT AND I'M GONNA

02:08:47.620 --> 02:08:50.222 region:rollup2
HAVE A SUGGESTION ABOUT THAT IN

02:08:48.454 --> 02:08:52.525 region:rollup2
JUST A FEW MINUTES.

02:08:50.222 --> 02:08:55.461 region:rollup2
ARM AGAIN SPEAKING TO.

02:08:52.525 --> 02:08:57.029 region:rollup2
THE WHAT APPEARS TO BE UNEVEN

02:08:55.461 --> 02:08:58.564 region:rollup2
REPORTING BY INSURANCE CARRIERS

02:08:57.029 --> 02:09:00.399 region:rollup2
I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE TALKED

02:08:58.564 --> 02:09:01.267 region:rollup2
TO MISTER SECONDS ARE MEMBER WHO

02:09:00.399 --> 02:09:03.436 region:rollup2
HAS A TWENTY FIVE PERCENT

02:09:01.267 --> 02:09:05.905 region:rollup2
SUCCESS RATE. NOW INTERNALLY MY

02:09:03.436 --> 02:09:07.273 region:rollup2
GOODNESS FAR MAYBE THAT'S RIGHT.

02:09:05.905 --> 02:09:08.908 region:rollup2
BETTER NOBODY ELSE'S MAN IF I

02:09:07.273 --> 02:09:09.709 region:rollup2
CAN IF I UNDERSTAND THE NUMBERS

02:09:08.908 --> 02:09:11.110 region:rollup2
CORRECTLY.

02:09:09.709 --> 02:09:11.644 region:rollup2
I DATA ANALYTICS.

02:09:11.110 --> 02:09:16.349 region:rollup2
WE'RE. COMPLETELY ONBOARD

02:09:11.644 --> 02:09:17.650 region:rollup2
WITH-USING DATA TO GENERATE

02:09:16.349 --> 02:09:19.051 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE INFORMATION SO THAT

02:09:17.650 --> 02:09:19.952 region:rollup2
GOOD POLICY DECISIONS CAN BE

02:09:19.051 --> 02:09:22.555 region:rollup2
MADE I DON'T THINK YOU MAKE

02:09:19.952 --> 02:09:24.323 region:rollup2
POLICY DECISIONS ON DATA ALONE.

02:09:22.555 --> 02:09:26.258 region:rollup2
BUT BY THE SAME TOKEN.

02:09:24.323 --> 02:09:29.562 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT WITH RESPECT TO

02:09:26.258 --> 02:09:30.396 region:rollup2
THIS TO THE FRAUD ISSUE.

02:09:29.562 --> 02:09:32.431 region:rollup2
THERE'S SOME EDUCATION OUT OF

02:09:30.396 --> 02:09:33.966 region:rollup2
TAKE PLACE.

02:09:32.431 --> 02:09:35.468 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THE DIVISION AND A

02:09:33.966 --> 02:09:36.836 region:rollup2
CD I NEED TO PUT IN FRONT OF THE

02:09:35.468 --> 02:09:37.937 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY.

02:09:36.836 --> 02:09:40.139 region:rollup2
THE WHOLE.

02:09:37.937 --> 02:09:41.073 region:rollup2
ARMORY.

02:09:40.139 --> 02:09:41.907 region:rollup2
OF TOOLS THAT THEY HAVE AT THEIR

02:09:41.073 --> 02:09:43.943 region:rollup2
DISPOSAL.

02:09:41.907 --> 02:09:45.244 region:rollup2
AND EDUCATE.

02:09:43.943 --> 02:09:46.846 region:rollup2
THE PARTICIPANTS TO WHAT CAN BE

02:09:45.244 --> 02:09:47.346 region:rollup2
DONE.

02:09:46.846 --> 02:09:49.882 region:rollup2
NOT THE TACTICS NOT THE

02:09:47.346 --> 02:09:51.417 region:rollup2
STRATEGY.

02:09:49.882 --> 02:09:53.119 region:rollup2
BUT WHY SHOULDN'T EVERYBODY BE

02:09:51.417 --> 02:09:54.787 region:rollup2
AWARE OF WHERE THEY'RE LOOKING

02:09:53.119 --> 02:09:57.023 region:rollup2
WHY THEY'RE LOOKING AND WHAT

02:09:54.787 --> 02:09:58.124 region:rollup2
COULD BE THE RESULTS.

02:09:57.023 --> 02:10:03.262 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THAT DETERRENT

02:09:58.124 --> 02:10:05.665 region:rollup2
WOULD BE IMPORTANT.

02:10:03.262 --> 02:10:07.199 region:rollup2
I LIKE TO OUT.

02:10:05.665 --> 02:10:08.968 region:rollup2
WE GO TO WOULD A DIFFERENT LEVEL

02:10:07.199 --> 02:10:10.636 region:rollup2
OF FRAUD THAT WE BELIEVE IS IS

02:10:08.968 --> 02:10:12.638 region:rollup2
PERVASIVE ACTUALLY MAKE A TWO

02:10:10.636 --> 02:10:14.273 region:rollup2
COMMENTS IN THAT REGARD.

02:10:12.638 --> 02:10:16.042 region:rollup2
OTHER RECENT REVELATION THAT.

02:10:14.273 --> 02:10:17.677 region:rollup2
AT INSURANCE UTILIZATION REVIEW

02:10:16.042 --> 02:10:18.911 region:rollup2
POSITIONS RENDERED OPINIONS

02:10:17.677 --> 02:10:20.212 region:rollup2
BASED ON NURSE RECOMMENDATIONS

02:10:18.911 --> 02:10:22.181 region:rollup2
ONLY WITHOUT INSPECTING THE

02:10:20.212 --> 02:10:23.349 region:rollup2
PATIENT'S MEDICAL RECORDS.

02:10:22.181 --> 02:10:25.084 region:rollup2
HAS LEFT EVERYONE WITH A SHOCK

02:10:23.349 --> 02:10:26.152 region:rollup2
AND DOUBT.

02:10:25.084 --> 02:10:27.887 region:rollup2
WHILE THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED IN

02:10:26.152 --> 02:10:30.189 region:rollup2
THE GROUP HEALTH REALM.

02:10:27.887 --> 02:10:31.390 region:rollup2
WE HAVE EVIDENCE.

02:10:30.189 --> 02:10:32.692 region:rollup2
IN WE BELIEVE THAT THE SAME

02:10:31.390 --> 02:10:34.226 region:rollup2
PRACTICE OCCURS ON A REGULAR

02:10:32.692 --> 02:10:36.429 region:rollup2
BASIS AND CALIFORNIA'S WORKER'S

02:10:34.226 --> 02:10:37.329 region:rollup2
COMPENSATION SYSTEM.

02:10:36.429 --> 02:10:38.531 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM WITH GATHERING SUCH

02:10:37.329 --> 02:10:40.399 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE IS THE THREAT OF

02:10:38.531 --> 02:10:41.901 region:rollup2
RETRIBUTION BY INSURERS AND YOU

02:10:40.399 --> 02:10:43.969 region:rollup2
ARE COMPANIES WHO MIGHT SINGLE

02:10:41.901 --> 02:10:45.404 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION TO COME FORWARD.

02:10:43.969 --> 02:10:47.073 region:rollup2
TO ASSURE THAT INITIATIVES INTO

02:10:45.404 --> 02:10:48.574 region:rollup2
THIS GO FORWARD AND HAVE A

02:10:47.073 --> 02:10:50.176 region:rollup2
CHANCE OF SUCCESS.

02:10:48.574 --> 02:10:52.345 region:rollup2
WHISTLEBLOWER STATUS MUST BE

02:10:50.176 --> 02:10:53.212 region:rollup2
AFFORDED TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS.

02:10:52.345 --> 02:10:54.947 region:rollup2
HOW COULD THIS POSSIBLY

02:10:53.212 --> 02:10:56.682 region:rollup2
OCCURRING THE FIRST PLACE?

02:10:54.947 --> 02:10:58.684 region:rollup2
WELL MORE BY THINK IT'S CLEAR.

02:10:56.682 --> 02:11:00.186 region:rollup2
ITS PRODUCTIVITY.

02:10:58.684 --> 02:11:01.220 region:rollup2
MORE THROUGHPUT OF REVIEWS MEANS

02:11:00.186 --> 02:11:03.289 region:rollup2
FEWER MISSED DEADLINES AND

02:11:01.220 --> 02:11:04.857 region:rollup2
HIGHER MARGINS.

02:11:03.289 --> 02:11:06.125 region:rollup2
THE OPPORTUNITY EXISTS

02:11:04.857 --> 02:11:07.693 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE YOU OUR PROCESS

02:11:06.125 --> 02:11:11.263 region:rollup2
BELIEVES THAT IT CAN HIDE BEHIND

02:11:07.693 --> 02:11:12.431 region:rollup2
EXCLUSIVE REMEDY.

02:11:11.263 --> 02:11:13.799 region:rollup2
IN THE MEANTIME THE COMMUNITY

02:11:12.431 --> 02:11:15.134 region:rollup2
WAITS FOR THE OPINION AND KING

02:11:13.799 --> 02:11:16.335 region:rollup2
VERSUS COMP PARTNERS CASE

02:11:15.134 --> 02:11:17.870 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY WITH THE CALIFORNIA

02:11:16.335 --> 02:11:19.238 region:rollup2
SUPREME COURT.

02:11:17.870 --> 02:11:20.673 region:rollup2
THAT WILL LIKELY IT LATER REST

02:11:19.238 --> 02:11:22.408 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT YOU ARE HAS

02:11:20.673 --> 02:11:23.008 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CARE AND

02:11:22.408 --> 02:11:25.277 region:rollup2
SAFETY OF THE INJURED WORKERS

02:11:23.008 --> 02:11:26.612 region:rollup2
WITH. IRAQ'S.

02:11:25.277 --> 02:11:28.547 region:rollup2
SHE SEEMS IN THE MEDICAL BOARD

02:11:26.612 --> 02:11:30.116 region:rollup2
OF CONSISTENTLY HELD THAT YOU

02:11:28.547 --> 02:11:31.784 region:rollup2
ARE IS THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE

02:11:30.116 --> 02:11:32.218 region:rollup2
AND PATIENT SHOULD BE ACCORDED A

02:11:31.784 --> 02:11:34.220 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF SAFETY AND

02:11:32.218 --> 02:11:35.921 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY.

02:11:34.220 --> 02:11:36.756 region:rollup2
THREE TIMES HE SEEMS ARE PUT

02:11:35.921 --> 02:11:38.557 region:rollup2
THROUGH LEGISLATION AND WAS NOT

02:11:36.756 --> 02:11:40.359 region:rollup2
OPPOSED.

02:11:38.557 --> 02:11:41.193 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED YOU ARE

02:11:40.359 --> 02:11:43.329 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS TO BE LICENSED IN

02:11:41.193 --> 02:11:45.297 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

02:11:43.329 --> 02:11:46.198 region:rollup2
EACH TIME IT WAS VETOED BY THE

02:11:45.297 --> 02:11:47.066 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR THAT WAS SEATED AT THE

02:11:46.198 --> 02:11:49.034 region:rollup2
TIME.

02:11:47.066 --> 02:11:50.102 region:rollup2
WHY?

02:11:49.034 --> 02:11:52.605 region:rollup2
WHAT'S THE FEAR. WE DON'T

02:11:50.102 --> 02:11:54.306 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT.

02:11:52.605 --> 02:11:56.709 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S CONTRIBUTING TO.

02:11:54.306 --> 02:11:58.544 region:rollup2
THE KIND OF FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY

02:11:56.709 --> 02:12:00.880 region:rollup2
THE DECEPTION THAT TAKES PLACE.

02:11:58.544 --> 02:12:02.915 region:rollup2
WHEN A YOU ARE DECISION IS MADE

02:12:00.880 --> 02:12:04.049 region:rollup2
BY SOMEBODY IT TO DENY. IS MADE

02:12:02.915 --> 02:12:07.820 region:rollup2
BY SOMEBODY BESIDES.

02:12:04.049 --> 02:12:09.021 region:rollup2
A PHYSICIAN.

02:12:07.820 --> 02:12:10.623 region:rollup2
REFERRING BACK TO THE ISSUE

02:12:09.021 --> 02:12:12.124 region:rollup2
WASTE OF RESOURCES WE PROPOSED

02:12:10.623 --> 02:12:13.492 region:rollup2
ANY REMAINING MONEY. SHE

02:12:12.124 --> 02:12:15.060 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY GRANTED TO THE DIVISION

02:12:13.492 --> 02:12:16.629 region:rollup2
OF WORKERS COMPENSATION.

02:12:15.060 --> 02:12:17.196 region:rollup2
OR THEY OUGHT TO SHIFT SOME OF

02:12:16.629 --> 02:12:18.597 region:rollup2
THE MONEY THAT THEY HAVE IN

02:12:17.196 --> 02:12:20.132 region:rollup2
THEIR CURRENT BUDGET.

02:12:18.597 --> 02:12:21.267 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO MAKE THEIR.

I MENTIONED BEFORE. THAT THE.

02:12:25.571 --> 02:12:28.808 region:rollup2
I'M GONNA SAY THOUSANDS

02:12:27.273 --> 02:12:29.408 region:rollup2
OF COMPLAINTS THAT COME FROM

02:12:28.808 --> 02:12:34.313 region:rollup2
INJURED WORKERS IN PHYSICIANS

FOR SOME.

02:12:34.313 --> 02:12:38.083 region:rollup2
IF FOR A PAR ON IT THEY CALL IT.

02:12:36.115 --> 02:12:38.784 region:rollup2
EVERY FIVE YEARS.

02:12:38.083 --> 02:12:40.386 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THAT ESPECIALLY

AUDITS IN THE ISSUE IN ON THE

02:12:40.386 --> 02:12:43.589 region:rollup2

SECOND.

02:12:53.065 --> 02:12:55.868 region:rollup2
IN THIS IS OF A FRAUD THAT'S

02:12:53.966 --> 02:12:56.669 region:rollup2
EVEN MORE WIDESPREAD INSIDIOUS.

02:12:55.868 --> 02:12:58.070 region:rollup2

THIS ISSUE IS MERELY THE TIP OF

02:13:08.747 --> 02:13:11.617 region:rollup2
AN ICEBERG.

02:13:10.015 --> 02:13:13.185 region:rollup2
IT'S BEEN RAISED ON A NATIONAL

ATTENTION.

02:13:13.185 --> 02:13:16.489 region:rollup2
IRONICALLY THAT ATTENTION BEGAN

02:13:14.653 --> 02:13:18.724 region:rollup2
AS EVIDENCE HEARING CALIFORNIA

02:13:45.117 --> 02:13:47.553 region:rollup2
THAT YOU LEVEL OF REPORTING

02:13:46.151 --> 02:13:49.154 region:rollup2
RESULTED IN REVELATION THAT SUCH

02:13:47.553 --> 02:13:50.422 region:rollup2

02:13:51.824 --> 02:13:55.261 region:rollup2
IN THIS BECAUSE THEN THE RISING

02:13:53.525 --> 02:13:57.530 region:rollup2

LARGER PROPORTION OF COSTS

THEN EITHER INDEMNITY BENEFITS

02:14:05.304 --> 02:14:08.374 region:rollup2

WE WOULD.

02:14:14.914 --> 02:14:16.782 region:rollup2

02:14:16.015 --> 02:14:18.484 region:rollup2
LIKE TO BE INVITED TO

SEVERAL AND THE FORMAT FROM HIM

02:14:30.629 --> 02:14:34.166 region:rollup2
FOR BY SIX TO A EIGHT BY ELEVEN

02:14:33.432 --> 02:14:36.201 region:rollup2

LEDGER SIZE IN ORDER TO

02:14:36.201 --> 02:14:40.806 region:rollup2
MAINTAIN THIS THE SITE NONE OF

02:14:39.638 --> 02:14:41.340 region:rollup2
THOSE RIVER REFORMS.

02:14:40.806 --> 02:14:42.908 region:rollup2
OR FOSTER BY THE PROVIDER

02:14:41.340 --> 02:14:45.277 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY.

02:14:42.908 --> 02:14:48.280 region:rollup2
THOSE COMPLICATIONS HAVE CAUSED

02:14:45.277 --> 02:14:49.515 region:rollup2
THE ISSUES THAT CAUSE FRAUD OR

02:14:48.280 --> 02:14:52.184 region:rollup2
ALLOW FRAUD TO.

02:14:49.515 --> 02:14:53.752 region:rollup2
TO PROOFREAD WE BELIEVE. THE

02:14:52.184 --> 02:14:55.454 region:rollup2
MORE COMPLICATED THE SYSTEM IS

02:14:53.752 --> 02:14:57.489 region:rollup2
THE THE EASIER IT IS TO WIGGLE

02:14:55.454 --> 02:15:02.394 region:rollup2
YOUR WAY INTO AND CREATED THIS

02:14:57.489 --> 02:15:04.363 region:rollup2
FOR ONESELF THAT MAY GET HIDDEN.

02:15:02.394 --> 02:15:06.165 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT A LARGER TABLE

02:15:04.363 --> 02:15:07.1000 region:rollup2
WITH MORE DISCUSSION.

02:15:06.165 --> 02:15:09.902 region:rollup2
MORE DELIBERATION.

02:15:07.1000 --> 02:15:12.638 region:rollup2
IS THE WAY TO GO ABOUT THIS AND

02:15:09.902 --> 02:15:14.440 region:rollup2
I I RESPECT THE CHAIR SAT A

02:15:12.638 --> 02:15:14.840 region:rollup2

HOPE THAT THIS IS THE FIRST OF A

02:15:23.749 --> 02:15:26.952 region:rollup2
SERIES OF OVERSIGHT HEARINGS ON

02:15:25.117 --> 02:15:29.221 region:rollup2
A NUMBER OF OF ISSUES THAT I

02:15:26.952 --> 02:15:30.155 region:rollup2
THINK CAN IMPROVE THE WORKERS

02:16:59.678 --> 02:17:02.414 region:rollup2
