COMPLETELY UNDER THE CONTROL OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT IF THE CITY CHOOSES TO IMPLEMENT SB TEN THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE THAT CITY WITH AN INEXPENSIVE AND EFFECTIVE TOOL TO REZONE PARCELS UP TO TEN UNITS. IF THEY CHOOSE NOT TO IMPLEMENT SB TEN NOTHING WILL CHANGE TO OPT INTO SB TEN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MUST AUTHORIZE AN ORDINANCE THAT CLEARLY SHOWS WHICH PARCELS THEY WILL BE REZONING. IF THEY CHOOSE NOT TO OPT IN AGAIN NOTHING CHANGES WE DON'T KNOW WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF THE MOST INTENSE HOUSING CRISIS IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY. AND THE CURRENT LAW HAS MADE IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR CITIES TO REZONE. IT CAN TAKE MANY YEARS TO COMPLETE EVEN A MODEST REZONING COST AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY AND OFTEN LEAD TO AN ENDING LITIGATION THIS BILL ONLY APPLIES TO AREAS THAT ARE NEAR TRANSIT OR IN OR ARE IN URBAN INFILL AREAS. INCENTIVIZING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO CONCENTRATE NEW HOUSING IN URBAN IN FILL AND TRANSIT RICH COMMUNITIES. TO BE CLEAR. THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE HOW INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS ARE APPROVED SB TEN ONLY APPLIES TO THE ZONING OF THOSE PARCELS. INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS WILL STILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE EXISTING PROCESS AND SEEK REVIEW. EVEN IF IT INCLUDES A SECRET DISCRETIONARY VIEW THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE THAT THIS BILL HAS REAL POTENTIAL TO EMPOWER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PURSUE MORE EQUITABLE UP ZONES. FOR SMALL MEDIUM DENSITY CONSTRUCTION CONSISTENT WITH FAIR HOUSING LAW. GIVEN THAT SEEK REVIEWS ARE OFTEN LONG UNPREDICTABLE AND EXPENSIVE. I HOPE THAT WE CAN ALL SUPPORT THIS BILL AGAIN IT IS COMPLETELY OPTIONAL. DESIGNED TO EMPOWER CITIES TO BUILD MORE HOUSING IN A WAY THAT IS SUITABLE FOR THEM AND WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR RIVAL. THANK YOU MISTER MISTER KALRA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED AT YOUR DESK. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE TODAY ALSO IN SUPPORT OF SB TEN WHICH IS A SIMPLE AND VOLUNTARY HOUSING BILLS. THAT COULD MAKE A VERY LARGE IMPACT ON A HOUSING SHORTAGE FOR YEARS CALIFORNIA HAS FALED TO PRODUCE ENOUGH HOUSING TO KEEP UP WITH OUR GROWING POPULATION. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT WE NEED TO BUILD BETWEEN ONE POINT EIGHT AND TWO POINT FIVE MILLION NEW HOMES JUST TO THE NEXT FOUR YEARS D. EASE OUR HOUSING CRISIS TO JUST TO MANAGEABLE LEVELS. HOWEVER WITH MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF RESIDENTIAL LAND CALIFORNIA'S OWN FOR SINGLE FAMILY HOMES PRODUCING THE AMOUNT OF HOUSING NEEDED UNDER OUR CURRENT ZONING LAWS IS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE. SB TEN IS A COMPLETELY OPTIONAL BILL THAT PROVIDES CITIES WITH THE CHOICE TO IMPLEMENT A TOOL TO ADDRESS OUR HOUSING SHORTAGE BY ALLOWING THEM TO QUICKLY UPS ON AN URBAN IN FILL IN TRANSIT RICH AREAS. IN AN EFFORT TO PRODUCE MORE SMALL UNIT MISSING MIDDLE HOUSING THE CALIFORNIA'S LAW CALIFORNIA LACKS SB TEN WILL GIVE LOCAL GOVERNMENT A QUICKER PATH TO REZONE SPECIFIC PARTS OF THEIR COMMUNITIES FOR UP TO TEN UNITS ALONG THIS MARCH OBSERVE TO BE SHE IT'LL SAVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS EXTENSIVE TIME MONEY AND RESOURCES WHICH ARE ALL EXTREMELY VALUABLE. REPRODUCING AN INCREASED AMOUNT OF HOUSING. AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO STATED THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE OUT INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS ARE APPROVED. SB TEN ONLY APPLIES TO THE REZONING OF THESE PARCELS. INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS WILL STILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH THEIR EXISTING LOCAL APPROVING APPROVAL PROCESS. WHICH INCLUDES AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID IN A SEQUEL DISCRETIONARY REVIEW OUR CITIES NEED TO PRODUCE MORE HOUSING NOT ONLY TO ADDRESS THE GROWING DEMAND BUT ALSO TO MEET THEIR SIX CYCLE REAL NUMBERS. AND I BELIEVE IT IS THE STATE'S JOB TO PROVIDE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH ADDITIONAL TOOLS TO DO SO SUCCESSFULY. SB TEN HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TOOL FOR CITIES THAT WANT TO USE IT AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANKS CALMEST IN YOUR RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS TODAY I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB TEN. THIS IS AN OPT IN TO HOLD OUR CITIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN USE. TO BUILD HOUSING WHERE IT IS NEEDED THE MOST.

ONLY A FEW YEARS LATER WE ARE SEEING THE GROWTH OF VIBRANT COMMUNITY HUBS AROUND THE STATIONS WITH AFFORDABLE MARKET RATE AND MIXED USE DEVELOPMENTS ALL LOCATED WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE. OF A WORLD CLASS TRANSIT SYSTEM. THE KIND OF HOUSING THAT THIS BILL ENVISIONS IS THE KIND OF HOUSING THAT MAKES CITIES LIVABLE AND AT THE END OF THE DAY. EACH COMMUNITY WILL CHOOSE WHETHER THEY TAKE WHETHER THEY WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE PROVISIONS ARE NOT. WE REGULARLY PASS BILLS HOUSING BILLS THAT ASK A LOT OF OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS LET'S PASS THIS BILL TO PROVIDE THEM WITH THE ABILITY TO DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES. HOW THEY WANT TO SHAPE THEIR COMMUNITIES I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I'VE THANKS GRAYSON MISS WICKS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS AND I THINK MY COLLEAGUES FROM SAN FRANCISCO SAN JOSE IN CONCORD. HAVE ARTICULATED WHY I'M A SUPPORTER OF THIS BILL AS A CO AUTHOR I STRONGLY URGE AN AYE VOTE. THIS BILL IS VOLUNTARY IT EMPOWERS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO TAKE THE ISSUE INTO THEIR OWN HANDS IN THE WAY THAT THEY CHOOSE TO. AND WHAT IT DOES MOST IMPORTANTLY IS THAT CAN LEAD TO MORE PRODUCTION OF THAT MISSING MIDDLE HOUSING THAT WE NEED SO DESPERATELY I HAVE TEACHERS AND- NURSES IN MY DISTRICT THAT ARE DRIVING FOUR HOURS ROUND TRIP. EVERY SINGLE DAY TO GO TO WORK. IT'S NOT HEALTHY FOR THEM IT'S NOT HEALTHY FOR OUR COMMUNITIES IT'S NOT GOOD FOR OUR ENVIRONMENT. WHEN THEY'RE SPENDING SO MUCH TIME ON THE ROAD SO IN THESE URBAN AREAS WE NEED MORE TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NEEDED. AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.
