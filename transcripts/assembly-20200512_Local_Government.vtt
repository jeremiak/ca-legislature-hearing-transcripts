01:33:13.888 --> 01:33:14.989
CHALLENGES US TO THINK

UP THE COST OF HOUSING. THEY

01:34:49.183 --> 01:34:50.251
CAN REDUCE THE NUMBER OF UNITS

01:34:50.317 --> 01:34:52.787
PRODUCED. AND IN SOME INSTANCES

01:34:52.853 --> 01:34:54.355

02:01:16.736 --> 02:01:18.004
ACTUALLY REALLY PRACTICAL

02:01:18.070 --> 02:01:19.972

ORGANIZATIONS HAVE UNDER

02:01:24.143 --> 02:01:26.078
UTILIZED PARKING BUT IT DOESN'T

02:01:26.145 --> 02:01:27.179
SEEM THERE'S A REQUIREMENT IN

02:01:27.246 --> 02:01:29.482
THE BILL TO HAVE AN ANALYSIS TO

02:01:29.548 --> 02:01:31.017

02:01:42.695 --> 02:01:43.229
FURTHER MY QUESTION IS WHERE

02:01:43.295 --> 02:01:45.464
PEOPLE SUPPOSED TO GO ON DAYS

02:01:45.531 --> 02:01:46.699
