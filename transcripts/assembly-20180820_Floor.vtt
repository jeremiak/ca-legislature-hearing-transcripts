SAFER.

03:52:52.492 --> 03:52:54.594 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S NOT BASED ON

BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR THAT THIS

03:57:30.970 --> 03:57:33.573 region:rollup2
BILL REFORM WAS GOING TO BE A

03:57:31.571 --> 03:57:34.173 region:rollup2
PRIORITY.

03:57:33.573 --> 03:57:35.641 region:rollup2
BUT YET HERE WE ARE TWO WEEKS

03:57:34.173 --> 03:57:38.077 region:rollup2
OUT.

03:57:35.641 --> 03:57:40.480 region:rollup2
AND THIS GETS WORKED A FOR HOW

03:57:38.077 --> 03:57:41.848 region:rollup2
DESPICABLE.

03:57:40.480 --> 03:57:43.549 region:rollup2
SOMETHING HAS A CRITICALLY IS A

03:57:41.848 --> 03:57:44.050 region:rollup2
BUT IMPORTANT.

03:57:43.549 --> 03:57:47.053 region:rollup2
AS HOW WE HOLD PEOPLE IN

03:57:44.050 --> 03:57:49.222 region:rollup2
CUSTODY.

03:57:47.053 --> 03:57:50.089 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALLEGEDLY

03:57:49.222 --> 03:57:52.758 region:rollup2
COMMITTED VERY VERY DANGEROUS

03:57:50.089 --> 03:57:54.260 region:rollup2
OFFENSES.

03:57:52.758 --> 03:57:55.962 region:rollup2
BUT BECAUSE OF A BROKEN SYSTEM

03:57:54.260 --> 03:57:57.997 region:rollup2
WE HAVE THIS HURRIED POLICY THAT

03:57:55.962 --> 03:57:58.731 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA JAM TOGETHER.

03:57:57.997 --> 03:58:00.233 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE LEARN FROM OUR

03:57:58.731 --> 03:58:03.269 region:rollup2
MISTAKES IN THE PAST WILL YOU

DONE THOSE KIND OF HURRY POLICY?

03:58:03.269 --> 03:58:07.006 region:rollup2
THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES ARE

03:58:04.403 --> 03:58:09.475 region:rollup2
SEVERE PEOPLE.

03:58:07.006 --> 03:58:10.710 region:rollup2
VICTIMS VICTIMS ARE REAL.

03:58:09.475 --> 03:58:11.711 region:rollup2
I HAD THE UNFORTUNATE

03:58:10.710 --> 03:58:14.046 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCES OF FACING SOME OF

03:58:11.711 --> 03:58:15.081 region:rollup2
THESE VICTIMS.

03:58:14.046 --> 03:58:17.183 region:rollup2
AND TELLING THEM THE WORST THING

03:58:15.081 --> 03:58:19.585 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE.

03:58:17.183 --> 03:58:21.888 region:rollup2
THEIR LOVED ONE IS GONE.

03:58:19.585 --> 03:58:23.856 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW NO.

03:58:21.888 --> 03:58:25.625 region:rollup2
ONE WHO IS CRAFTED THIS BILL HAS

03:58:23.856 --> 03:58:27.660 region:rollup2
THE DESIRE TO STE TO HAVE THOSE

03:58:25.625 --> 03:58:28.494 region:rollup2
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES WILLIS

03:58:27.660 --> 03:58:30.797 region:rollup2
JUST TALK ABOUT THIS BILL FOR

03:58:28.494 --> 03:58:33.866 region:rollup2
JUST A SECOND.

03:58:30.797 --> 03:58:35.935 region:rollup2
THE ONLY WAY SOMEONE.

03:58:33.866 --> 03:58:37.737 region:rollup2
STAYS IN JAIL.

03:58:35.935 --> 03:58:40.072 region:rollup2
IS THAT THE PROSECUTION PUTS ON

03:58:37.737 --> 03:58:41.841 region:rollup2
A LITTLE MINI TRIAL.

03:58:40.072 --> 03:58:42.975 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE TRIAL THEY HAVE TO

03:58:41.841 --> 03:58:44.443 region:rollup2
PROVE WITH CLEAR CONVINCING

03:58:42.975 --> 03:58:46.012 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE.

03:58:44.443 --> 03:58:49.248 region:rollup2
BUT THAT PERSON IS A DANGER TO

03:58:46.012 --> 03:58:49.816 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC OR A FLIGHT RISK.

03:58:49.248 --> 03:58:52.752 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE EVERYONE ELSE GETS

03:58:49.816 --> 03:58:55.655 region:rollup2
OUT.

03:58:52.752 --> 03:58:57.623 region:rollup2
FOLKS THAT IS NOT GOOD POLICY.

03:58:55.655 --> 03:58:59.892 region:rollup2
WE CAN DO BETTER THAN THIS.

03:58:57.623 --> 03:59:02.161 region:rollup2
I TOTALLY AGREE.

03:58:59.892 --> 03:59:03.196 region:rollup2
THERE ARE BILL SYSTEM IS BROKEN.

03:59:02.161 --> 03:59:04.831 region:rollup2
AND WE NEED TO COME TOGETHER.

03:59:03.196 --> 03:59:07.533 region:rollup2
COLLECTIVELY [inaudible]

03:59:04.831 --> 03:59:09.502 region:rollup2
CALMLY.

03:59:07.533 --> 03:59:11.270 region:rollup2
AND IN IT ANY UNIFIED.

03:59:09.502 --> 03:59:12.371 region:rollup2
WELL THOUGHT OUT PROCESS.

03:59:11.270 --> 03:59:15.808 region:rollup2
NOT A HURRIED.

03:59:12.371 --> 03:59:17.677 region:rollup2
PANICKY OF THE POLICY LIKE THIS

03:59:15.808 --> 03:59:18.744 region:rollup2
IS COMING TO US.

03:59:17.677 --> 03:59:20.313 region:rollup2
WE COULD DO BETTER THAN THIS AND

03:59:18.744 --> 03:59:22.915 region:rollup2
WE HAVE.

03:59:20.313 --> 03:59:23.883 region:rollup2
TO I ASK YOUR NO VOTE.

03:59:22.915 --> 03:59:25.785 region:rollup2
IF YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER HARPER

SPEAKER.

03:59:28.087 --> 03:59:30.556 region:rollup2
A COUPLE OF POINTS I WANT TO

03:59:28.854 --> 03:59:32.158 region:rollup2
RISE TO IN REGARDS TO THIS ONE I

03:59:30.556 --> 03:59:33.993 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THE A MISDEMEANOR SEX

03:59:32.158 --> 03:59:35.661 region:rollup2
OFFENDERS WILL BE RELEASED.

03:59:33.993 --> 03:59:37.263 region:rollup2
WITHOUT A RISK ASSESSMENT

03:59:35.661 --> 03:59:38.864 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT UNDER THIS BILL THE

03:59:37.263 --> 03:59:40.633 region:rollup2
BILL'S EXEMPTION LANGUAGE ON

03:59:38.864 --> 03:59:42.201 region:rollup2
THIS POINT IS A LOOSER HE SINCE

03:59:40.633 --> 03:59:43.836 region:rollup2
IT REFERS TO THE OFFENSES THAT

03:59:42.201 --> 03:59:45.137 region:rollup2
ARE NOT MISDEMEANORS.

03:59:43.836 --> 03:59:46.572 region:rollup2
AND WOULD HAVE NO RISK

03:59:45.137 --> 03:59:48.274 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT TO DETERMINE THEM TO

03:59:46.572 --> 03:59:49.675 region:rollup2
BE HIGH RISK.

03:59:48.274 --> 03:59:51.043 region:rollup2
IT REFERS ALSO TO THE PROVISION

03:59:49.675 --> 03:59:53.746 region:rollup2
OF LAW WHICH DOES NOT TAKE

03:59:51.043 --> 03:59:54.313 region:rollup2
EFFECT UNTIL.

03:59:53.746 --> 03:59:56.148 region:rollup2
TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUT MANAGE

03:59:54.313 --> 03:59:59.218 region:rollup2
VICAR MEMBERS.

03:59:56.148 --> 04:00:00.820 region:rollup2
BILL BETTER INSURERS OFFENDERS

03:59:59.218 --> 04:00:03.322 region:rollup2
SHOW UP IN COURT THAN THIS

04:00:00.820 --> 04:00:06.225 region:rollup2
SYSTEM HERE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY

04:00:03.322 --> 04:00:07.860 region:rollup2
OF THE 540-005-0090 EIGHT

04:00:06.225 --> 04:00:10.196 region:rollup2
WARRANTS IN THE SYSTEM. TWO

04:00:07.860 --> 04:00:11.297 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX OUR OWN

04:00:10.196 --> 04:00:14.367 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN RELEASED

04:00:11.297 --> 04:00:15.735 region:rollup2
ON BAIL THE BALANCE OF THE

04:00:14.367 --> 04:00:16.369 region:rollup2
540-003-0050.

04:00:15.735 --> 04:00:18.504 region:rollup2
TWO HAVE BEEN RELEASED ON THEIR

04:00:16.369 --> 04:00:20.306 region:rollup2
OWN RECOGNIZANCE BAIL IS A

04:00:18.504 --> 04:00:23.142 region:rollup2
BETTER WAY OF ENSURING OFFENDERS

04:00:20.306 --> 04:00:25.177 region:rollup2
APPEAR AND IF THEY DON'T GETTING

04:00:23.142 --> 04:00:28.080 region:rollup2
THEM BACK IN COURT.

04:00:25.177 --> 04:00:28.648 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THIS IS A RISKY.

04:00:28.080 --> 04:00:31.317 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL SYSTEM UNDER THIS

04:00:28.648 --> 04:00:32.918 region:rollup2
BILL.

04:00:31.317 --> 04:00:34.186 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD

04:00:32.918 --> 04:00:36.756 region:rollup2
BE PUTTING THE LIVES.

04:00:34.186 --> 04:00:37.924 region:rollup2

SITTING ON THE FENCE.

04:00:56.943 --> 04:01:00.813 region:rollup2
THINK DEEPLY ABOUT THE JUMP THE

04:00:58.744 --> 04:01:01.280 region:rollup2
LEAP YOU'RE ABOUT TO MAKE.

04:01:00.813 --> 04:01:03.015 region:rollup2
ON BEHALF THE STATE OF

04:01:01.280 --> 04:01:04.517 region:rollup2

04:01:03.015 --> 04:01:05.518 region:rollup2
THE FIRST ARGUMENTS REALLY HAS

TO DO WITH THE PROCESS AS MY

04:01:05.518 --> 04:01:08.954 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUE POINTED OUT.

04:01:07.720 --> 04:01:10.957 region:rollup2
YOU LOSE SOMETHING IN MAKING

04:01:08.954 --> 04:01:12.258 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION WHEN YOU RUSH IT.

04:01:10.957 --> 04:01:14.060 region:rollup2
YOU LOSE THE ABILITY TO TO

04:01:12.258 --> 04:01:14.660 region:rollup2
DELIBERATE TO BRING IN EXPERTS

04:01:14.060 --> 04:01:16.028 region:rollup2
BRING IN PEOPLE THAT KNOW WHAT

04:01:14.660 --> 04:01:17.463 region:rollup2
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT.

04:01:16.028 --> 04:01:18.597 region:rollup2
SOME OF YOU AND I DON'T MEAN ANY

04:01:17.463 --> 04:01:19.298 region:rollup2
OFFENSE BUT SOME YOU PROBABLY

04:01:18.597 --> 04:01:20.967 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE

04:01:19.298 --> 04:01:23.269 region:rollup2
BETWEEN JAIL BAIL AND A BALE OF

04:01:20.967 --> 04:01:24.270 region:rollup2
HAY.

04:01:23.269 --> 04:01:25.004 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT A

04:01:24.270 --> 04:01:26.038 region:rollup2
SLIGHT.

04:01:25.004 --> 04:01:27.840 region:rollup2
THAT'S THAT'S A REALITY WE'RE

WITH FORTY MILLION PEOPLE AND

04:01:32.011 --> 04:01:34.280 region:rollup2
AND THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS

04:01:33.479 --> 04:01:36.048 region:rollup2
TO DELIBERATE AND BRING IN

04:01:34.280 --> 04:01:36.549 region:rollup2
EXPERTS AND THINK ABOUT THINGS

04:01:36.048 --> 04:01:37.717 region:rollup2
AND RUN THEM THROUGH THE

04:01:36.549 --> 04:01:39.819 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

04:01:37.717 --> 04:01:41.620 region:rollup2
THAT WE ALL TRUST TO RELY ON I

04:01:39.819 --> 04:01:43.389 region:rollup2
COME OUT THE OTHER SIDE WITH.

THOUGHTFUL LEGISLATION AGREE OR

DISAGREE WITH.

04:01:44.657 --> 04:01:48.260 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS NO SMALL CHANGE.

04:01:46.625 --> 04:01:50.129 region:rollup2
MAKE NO MISTAKE IF YOU DON'T

DIFFICULTIES.

04:02:14.720 --> 04:02:17.156 region:rollup2
THE SECOND POINT I'D LIKE TO

04:02:15.688 --> 04:02:18.357 region:rollup2
MAKE IS TO ASK YOU TO CONSIDER

04:02:17.156 --> 04:02:20.059 region:rollup2

OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY THAT IS

04:07:18.123 --> 04:07:20.392 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK WE'VE

WHEN IT COMES TO THE

04:08:14.613 --> 04:08:17.649 region:rollup2

04:08:20.419 --> 04:08:23.088 region:rollup2
INNOCENCE BEFORE BEING PROVEN

04:08:21.687 --> 04:08:24.857 region:rollup2
GUILTY.

04:08:23.088 --> 04:08:27.059 region:rollup2
IN THIS STATE ONLY APPLIES IF

04:08:24.857 --> 04:08:28.494 region:rollup2
YOU'RE WEALTHY.

04:08:27.059 --> 04:08:30.195 region:rollup2
THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO DUE

04:08:28.494 --> 04:08:31.563 region:rollup2
PROCESS THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT

04:08:30.195 --> 04:08:33.065 region:rollup2
TO EQUAL PROTECTION HAVE BEEN

04:08:31.563 --> 04:08:35.667 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY CHALLENGE BECAUSE

04:08:33.065 --> 04:08:37.369 region:rollup2
THE MONEY BILL SYSTEM.

04:08:35.667 --> 04:08:37.936 region:rollup2
LET ME ALSO SAY AND I WILL SAY

04:08:37.369 --> 04:08:39.538 region:rollup2
THIS IS A CO AUTHOR OF THIS

04:08:37.936 --> 04:08:40.105 region:rollup2
BILL.

04:08:39.538 --> 04:08:42.207 region:rollup2
THIS MAY NOT BE THE PERFECT

04:08:40.105 --> 04:08:43.942 region:rollup2
BILL.

04:08:42.207 --> 04:08:45.944 region:rollup2
IT MAY NOT GO AS FAR AS PEOPLE

04:08:43.942 --> 04:08:47.913 region:rollup2
MAY WANT EITHER TO THE SO CALLED

04:08:45.944 --> 04:08:50.816 region:rollup2
LEFT OR TO THE SO CALLED RIGHT.

04:08:47.913 --> 04:08:52.451 region:rollup2
BUT WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

04:08:50.816 --> 04:08:54.086 region:rollup2
I WAS HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL

04:08:52.451 --> 04:08:54.753 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAD TO VOTE ON LAST YEAR

04:08:54.086 --> 04:08:55.621 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S NOT THE BILL WE HAVE

04:08:54.753 --> 04:08:57.423 region:rollup2
IN FRONT OF US.

04:08:55.621 --> 04:08:59.625 region:rollup2
THIS BILL TRIES TO STRIKE THE

04:08:57.423 --> 04:09:00.125 region:rollup2
RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN ALL THE

04:08:59.625 --> 04:09:01.560 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT WE HAVE BEEN

04:09:00.125 --> 04:09:03.729 region:rollup2
CONFRONTED WITH.

04:09:01.560 --> 04:09:04.797 region:rollup2
BUT WE NEED.

04:09:03.729 --> 04:09:06.398 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD

04:09:04.797 --> 04:09:07.699 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES I HOPE.

04:09:06.398 --> 04:09:09.368 region:rollup2
THAT YOU WILL JOIN US IN MAKING

04:09:07.699 --> 04:09:11.236 region:rollup2
HISTORY TODAY TO END A MONEY

04:09:09.368 --> 04:09:13.405 region:rollup2
BILL SYSTEM.

04:09:11.236 --> 04:09:15.174 region:rollup2
THAT HAS VIOLATED CONSTITUTIONS

04:09:13.405 --> 04:09:16.041 region:rollup2
THAT HAS ENSURED THAT POOR

04:09:15.174 --> 04:09:17.876 region:rollup2
PEOPLE CONTINUE TO REMAIN

04:09:16.041 --> 04:09:19.778 region:rollup2
VICTIMIZED IN OUR STATE.

04:09:17.876 --> 04:09:21.246 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM DID NOT

04:09:19.778 --> 04:09:22.948 region:rollup2
START WITH S. B. TEN IT'S NOT

04:09:21.246 --> 04:09:24.049 region:rollup2
GONNA END WITH S. B. TEN WE ARE

04:09:22.948 --> 04:09:24.416 region:rollup2
GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON

04:09:24.049 --> 04:09:26.218 region:rollup2
THIS.

04:09:24.416 --> 04:09:27.152 region:rollup2
THIS BILL HAS MANY MANY

04:09:26.218 --> 04:09:29.955 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS THAT WE CONTINUE TO

04:09:27.152 --> 04:09:31.123 region:rollup2
STUDY PERFECT TO MAKE IT BETTER.

04:09:29.955 --> 04:09:32.224 region:rollup2
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY I HOPE

04:09:31.123 --> 04:09:33.725 region:rollup2
WE CAN ALL JOIN.

04:09:32.224 --> 04:09:35.327 region:rollup2
IN TAKING A STEP FORWARD IN

04:09:33.725 --> 04:09:36.762 region:rollup2
REFORMING A SYSTEM THAT IS IN

04:09:35.327 --> 04:09:38.664 region:rollup2
DESPERATE NEED OF REFORM.

04:09:36.762 --> 04:09:39.665 region:rollup2
AS ROBERT F. KENNEDY SAID FIFTY

04:09:38.664 --> 04:09:40.232 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO.

04:09:39.665 --> 04:09:41.900 region:rollup2
MADAM SPEAKER PERMISSION TO

04:09:40.232 --> 04:09:43.602 region:rollup2
READ.

04:09:41.900 --> 04:09:45.070 region:rollup2
WITHOUT OBJECTION ONLY ONE

04:09:43.602 --> 04:09:46.371 region:rollup2
FACTOR DETERMINES WHETHER

04:09:45.070 --> 04:09:47.973 region:rollup2
DEFENDANT STAYS IN JAIL BEFORE

04:09:46.371 --> 04:09:49.208 region:rollup2
IT COMES TO TRIAL.

04:09:47.973 --> 04:09:51.076 region:rollup2
THAT FACTOR IS NOT GUILT OR

04:09:49.208 --> 04:09:51.944 region:rollup2
INNOCENCE IT IS NOT THE NATURE

04:09:51.076 --> 04:09:53.078 region:rollup2
OF THE CRIME.

04:09:51.944 --> 04:09:54.880 region:rollup2
IT IS NOT THE CHARACTER OF THE

04:09:53.078 --> 04:09:57.883 region:rollup2
DEFENDANT.

04:09:54.880 --> 04:09:58.684 region:rollup2
THAT FACTOR SIMPLY IS MONEY.

04:09:57.883 --> 04:10:00.786 region:rollup2
AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK

04:09:58.684 --> 04:10:01.653 region:rollup2
YOUR SUPPORT.

04:10:00.786 --> 04:10:06.492 region:rollup2

YOU KNOW WHEN THIS BILL FIRST

04:10:10.395 --> 04:10:13.732 region:rollup2
CAME UP.

04:10:11.697 --> 04:10:15.534 region:rollup2
I DIDN'T SUPPORT IT I DID VOTE

04:10:13.732 --> 04:10:17.669 region:rollup2
FOR IT BECAUSE I'M TERRIFIED.

04:10:15.534 --> 04:10:19.438 region:rollup2
I AM TERRIFIED THAT I AM BECOME

04:10:17.669 --> 04:10:21.740 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITY WATCH.

04:10:19.438 --> 04:10:23.508 region:rollup2
AT MY HOUSE WITH PEOPLE SHOWING

04:10:21.740 --> 04:10:24.843 region:rollup2
UP.

04:10:23.508 --> 04:10:27.412 region:rollup2
IN FRONT OF MY DOOR TO TRY AND

04:10:24.843 --> 04:10:28.947 region:rollup2
STEAL PACKAGES WHEN I'M UP HERE

04:10:27.412 --> 04:10:29.915 region:rollup2
MY WIFE AND MY CHILD ARE HOME

04:10:28.947 --> 04:10:32.184 region:rollup2
ALONE.

04:10:29.915 --> 04:10:33.652 region:rollup2
UNLIKELY I HAVE GREAT MEMBER --

04:10:32.184 --> 04:10:35.053 region:rollup2
NEIGHBORS AND WE ALL TRY TO LOOK

04:10:33.652 --> 04:10:36.355 region:rollup2
OUT FOR ONE ANOTHER BUT I'M

04:10:35.053 --> 04:10:37.456 region:rollup2
TERRIFIED ABOUT BEING UP HERE

04:10:36.355 --> 04:10:38.790 region:rollup2
NOT BEING ABLE TO BE HOME TO

04:10:37.456 --> 04:10:40.592 region:rollup2

04:10:38.790 --> 04:10:41.693 region:rollup2
SCARES.

04:10:40.592 --> 04:10:42.961 region:rollup2
AND SO.

04:10:41.693 --> 04:10:44.630 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS CONCERNED

04:10:42.961 --> 04:10:46.298 region:rollup2
ABOUT IS IF I TAKE A VOTE ON

BAIL REFORM.

04:10:46.298 --> 04:10:49.001 region:rollup2
CAN I HONESTLY SAY THAT I'M

04:10:47.599 --> 04:10:51.036 region:rollup2
DOING SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA

04:10:49.001 --> 04:10:53.071 region:rollup2
PROVIDE MORE SAFETY. TO MY

04:10:51.036 --> 04:10:55.307 region:rollup2
FAMILY WHEN I'M GONE.

04:10:53.071 --> 04:10:56.842 region:rollup2
AND I REALLY RESPECT THE WORK

04:10:55.307 --> 04:10:58.110 region:rollup2
THAT'S BEEN DONE BY THE AUTHOR I

04:10:56.842 --> 04:10:59.678 region:rollup2
RESPECT THE WORK THAT'S BEEN

04:10:58.110 --> 04:11:00.779 region:rollup2
DONE BY MY COLLEAGUE.

04:10:59.678 --> 04:11:02.614 region:rollup2
FROM OAKLAND BECAUSE THEY'VE

04:11:00.779 --> 04:11:03.849 region:rollup2
TAKEN A LOT OF TIME TO SAY THAT

04:11:02.614 --> 04:11:05.517 region:rollup2
THERE HASN'T BEEN ENOUGH TIME

04:11:03.849 --> 04:11:06.685 region:rollup2
AND CONSIDERATION PUT INTO THIS

04:11:05.517 --> 04:11:07.886 region:rollup2
MEASURE THAT'S NOT TRUE.

04:11:06.685 --> 04:11:09.288 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN A LOT OF TIME PUT INTO

04:11:07.886 --> 04:11:11.123 region:rollup2
THIS MEASURE I CARE ABOUT

04:11:09.288 --> 04:11:12.291 region:rollup2
PROCESS MY FATHER HAD A CAREER

04:11:11.123 --> 04:11:13.992 region:rollup2
OVER TWENTY YEARS IN THIS BY

04:11:12.291 --> 04:11:15.460 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT PROCESS.

04:11:13.992 --> 04:11:16.495 region:rollup2
THIS PROCESS IS RIGHT THIS

04:11:15.460 --> 04:11:17.896 region:rollup2
PROCESS IS NO DIFFERENT FROM

04:11:16.495 --> 04:11:18.196 region:rollup2
ANYTHING ELSE THAT WE'VE DONE

04:11:17.896 --> 04:11:20.599 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

04:11:18.196 --> 04:11:21.934 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW AT THE END OF THE

04:11:20.599 --> 04:11:23.201 region:rollup2
DAY.

04:11:21.934 --> 04:11:24.603 region:rollup2
ALL I WANT.

04:11:23.201 --> 04:11:26.038 region:rollup2
IS TO KNOW THAT I'M DOING

04:11:24.603 --> 04:11:26.338 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE

04:11:26.038 --> 04:11:28.674 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

04:11:26.338 --> 04:11:30.576 region:rollup2
MAKES.

04:11:28.674 --> 04:11:32.511 region:rollup2
MICE CONSTITUENTS SAFER MAKES IN

04:11:30.576 --> 04:11:33.979 region:rollup2
MY FAMILY SAFER.

04:11:32.511 --> 04:11:36.381 region:rollup2
WHERE AND WHEN THEY'RE AT HOME?

04:11:33.979 --> 04:11:37.749 region:rollup2
AND THE PROBLEM THAT I'VE HAD

04:11:36.381 --> 04:11:39.718 region:rollup2
WITH BAIL AND IN THE ME LET ME

04:11:37.749 --> 04:11:42.454 region:rollup2
BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THIS --

04:11:39.718 --> 04:11:44.189 region:rollup2
I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST ANYONE.

04:11:42.454 --> 04:11:46.325 region:rollup2
I HAVE NOTHING AGANST THE BAIL

04:11:44.189 --> 04:11:47.926 region:rollup2
AGENTS NOTHING AGAINST THE CO

04:11:46.325 --> 04:11:50.462 region:rollup2
YOU THIS ISN'T ABOUT WHO

04:11:47.926 --> 04:11:52.097 region:rollup2
SUPPORTS AND WHO OPPOSES THIS IS

04:11:50.462 --> 04:11:53.398 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT WE DO AS A

04:11:52.097 --> 04:11:54.700 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE BODY.

04:11:53.398 --> 04:11:56.668 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I AM

04:11:54.700 --> 04:11:58.036 region:rollup2
SICK AND TIRED OF UP HERE IN

04:11:56.668 --> 04:12:00.372 region:rollup2
SACRAMENTO IS.

04:11:58.036 --> 04:12:02.140 region:rollup2
IS THIS ABILITY FOR US TO ALWAYS

04:12:00.372 --> 04:12:03.909 region:rollup2
JUST PROTECT THE STATUS QUO

04:12:02.140 --> 04:12:05.677 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE'RE SO AFRAID OF WHAT

04:12:03.909 --> 04:12:07.813 region:rollup2
THE CHANGE IS GOING TO BE.

04:12:05.677 --> 04:12:09.614 region:rollup2
YOU CANNOT CREATE ANY TYPE OF

04:12:07.813 --> 04:12:11.683 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE UNLESS YOU'RE

04:12:09.614 --> 04:12:13.585 region:rollup2
WILLING TO TAKE SOME KIND OF A

04:12:11.683 --> 04:12:16.455 region:rollup2
RISK TO TRY SOMETHING NEW.

04:12:13.585 --> 04:12:19.424 region:rollup2
TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

04:12:16.455 --> 04:12:20.425 region:rollup2
AND I HAVE MY CONCERNS THIS IS

04:12:19.424 --> 04:12:22.027 region:rollup2
NOT A PERFECT PIECE OF

04:12:20.425 --> 04:12:23.762 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION.

04:12:22.027 --> 04:12:25.430 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK IT GOES FAR ENOUGH.

04:12:23.762 --> 04:12:25.964 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE WAY WE

04:12:25.430 --> 04:12:27.966 region:rollup2
LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO COMMIT

04:12:25.964 --> 04:12:29.701 region:rollup2
CRIMES.

04:12:27.966 --> 04:12:31.169 region:rollup2
HOW THEIR HELD WHY THEY'RE HELD

04:12:29.701 --> 04:12:33.438 region:rollup2
AND HAVE SOME TYPE OF ASSESSMENT

04:12:31.169 --> 04:12:35.173 region:rollup2
AND HAVE THIS THE ASSESSMENT ON

04:12:33.438 --> 04:12:36.808 region:rollup2
THEIR ABILITY TO RE OFFEND BE

04:12:35.173 --> 04:12:37.776 region:rollup2
THE DETERMINING FACTOR AS TO

04:12:36.808 --> 04:12:38.276 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT SOMEONE SHOULD BE

04:12:37.776 --> 04:12:40.012 region:rollup2
OUT?

04:12:38.276 --> 04:12:41.913 region:rollup2
OR NOT WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE

04:12:40.012 --> 04:12:43.615 region:rollup2
THEIR BILL THE ABILITY TO PAY

04:12:41.913 --> 04:12:44.983 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY CAN GOING TO AMEND

04:12:43.615 --> 04:12:46.885 region:rollup2
MURDER GET A MILLION DOLLAR.

04:12:44.983 --> 04:12:48.587 region:rollup2
BOND SAID AND THEN THEY CAN BAIL

04:12:46.885 --> 04:12:49.955 region:rollup2
OUT BUT THEIR MURDER AND LOOK AT

04:12:48.587 --> 04:12:51.123 region:rollup2
THEIR CUES OF BEING A MURDERER

04:12:49.955 --> 04:12:52.357 region:rollup2
WERE UNDER THIS THEY WOULDN'T

04:12:51.123 --> 04:12:53.592 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT SAME ABILITY.

04:12:52.357 --> 04:12:55.961 region:rollup2
AND SO IT'S TAKING A LOOK AT THE

04:12:53.592 --> 04:12:56.795 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT STRUCTURES OF HOW WE

04:12:55.961 --> 04:12:58.397 region:rollup2
SET.

04:12:56.795 --> 04:12:59.464 region:rollup2
UP WHETHER THE BAIL SCHEDULE IS

04:12:58.397 --> 04:13:01.333 region:rollup2
BETTER OR RISK ASSESSMENT IS

04:12:59.464 --> 04:13:02.667 region:rollup2
BETTER BETTER AND I THINK THAT

04:13:01.333 --> 04:13:05.103 region:rollup2
IN THIS INSTANCE A RISK

04:13:02.667 --> 04:13:06.938 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT IS A FAR BETTER TOOL

04:13:05.103 --> 04:13:08.707 region:rollup2
TO ASSESS SOMEONE'S ABILITY TO

04:13:06.938 --> 04:13:10.175 region:rollup2
RE OFFEND OR FAN OR CONTINUE TO

04:13:08.707 --> 04:13:11.877 region:rollup2
VICTIMIZE AS OPPOSED TO WHETHER

04:13:10.175 --> 04:13:13.678 region:rollup2
OR NOT THEY HAVE THE MONEY. TO

04:13:11.877 --> 04:13:15.247 region:rollup2
BAIL THEMSELVES OUT OR NOT AN

04:13:13.678 --> 04:13:17.649 region:rollup2
ISSUE THAT WAS BROUGHT UP --

04:13:15.247 --> 04:13:18.183 region:rollup2
WAS THIS THIS THIS ISSUE OF TWO

04:13:17.649 --> 04:13:19.117 region:rollup2
NINETY IN MISDEMEANOR SEX

04:13:18.183 --> 04:13:20.919 region:rollup2
CRIMES.

04:13:19.117 --> 04:13:22.220 region:rollup2
THAT CONCERNS ME BECAUSE I HAVE

04:13:20.919 --> 04:13:23.088 region:rollup2
A DAUGHTER NOBODY KNOWS I'M

04:13:22.220 --> 04:13:23.922 region:rollup2
GONNA TELL YOU NOW I HAVE

04:13:23.088 --> 04:13:27.159 region:rollup2
ANOTHER DAUGHTER ON THE WAY.

04:13:23.922 --> 04:13:27.659 region:rollup2
AND THAT THAT TERRIFIES ME

04:13:27.159 --> 04:13:29.394 region:rollup2
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S

04:13:27.659 --> 04:13:31.029 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO ME --

04:13:29.394 --> 04:13:32.931 region:rollup2
NOW I'VE TALKED TO THE DA'S I

04:13:31.029 --> 04:13:34.533 region:rollup2
SPOKE TO JACKIE LACEY --

04:13:32.931 --> 04:13:35.467 region:rollup2
THIS THIS AFTERNOON A SKINNY

BEING ABLE TO GO OUT AND CREATE

CHARGED WITH A FELONY IT STAYS

04:14:06.698 --> 04:14:07.866 region:rollup2
THE MISDEMEANOR WHAT ENDS UP

04:14:07.265 --> 04:14:09.768 region:rollup2

THESE PEOPLE ALREADY OUT.

04:14:15.340 --> 04:14:18.176 region:rollup2
AND SO WHAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING

04:14:16.408 --> 04:14:20.812 region:rollup2
ON IS AMENDMENTS THAT ARE GOING

04:14:18.176 --> 04:14:22.247 region:rollup2
TO BE COMING IN A BILL S. B..

04:14:20.812 --> 04:14:24.349 region:rollup2
TEN FIFTY FOUR I AND WE'RE GONNA

04:14:22.247 --> 04:14:25.484 region:rollup2
BE LOOKING TO FIX THIS ISSUE --

04:14:24.349 --> 04:14:26.752 region:rollup2
MOVING FORWARD BECAUSE I KNOW

04:14:25.484 --> 04:14:28.220 region:rollup2
THAT THEIR CONCERNS I THINK IT'S

04:14:26.752 --> 04:14:30.155 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THAT WE THAT WE THAT

04:14:28.220 --> 04:14:31.690 region:rollup2
WE TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION

04:14:30.155 --> 04:14:32.791 region:rollup2
BUT THINK ABOUT THIS.

04:14:31.690 --> 04:14:34.092 region:rollup2
TOO OWE YOU KNOW WHY DON'T YOU

04:14:32.791 --> 04:14:35.026 region:rollup2
JUST FIXING OUR YOU KNOW THEIR

04:14:34.092 --> 04:14:35.794 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF

04:14:35.026 --> 04:14:36.461 region:rollup2
ARGUMENTS ARE GOING TO BE MADE

04:14:35.794 --> 04:14:38.029 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS.

04:14:36.461 --> 04:14:39.030 region:rollup2
BUT NOTHING IS PERFECT THE FIRST

04:14:38.029 --> 04:14:41.032 region:rollup2
TIME WE PASS IT IS ABOUT

04:14:39.030 --> 04:14:43.001 region:rollup2
CREATING THAT'S THAT CHANGED

04:14:41.032 --> 04:14:43.835 region:rollup2
TAKING THAT FIRST BIG STEP.

04:14:43.001 --> 04:14:45.537 region:rollup2
ON THE MOON WE PASS ON THIS

04:14:43.835 --> 04:14:46.972 region:rollup2
FLOOR --

04:14:45.537 --> 04:14:48.340 region:rollup2
LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA

04:14:46.972 --> 04:14:49.641 region:rollup2
WITHIN PASSING KNOWING THAT WE

04:14:48.340 --> 04:14:50.942 region:rollup2
WOULD NEVER COME BACK TO FIX IT

04:14:49.641 --> 04:14:51.543 region:rollup2
WE PASS AND UNDERSTANDING THAT

04:14:50.942 --> 04:14:52.677 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GOING TO BE PROBLEMS

04:14:51.543 --> 04:14:53.311 region:rollup2
THAT ARE GOING TO RISE.

04:14:52.677 --> 04:14:54.746 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO COME BACK

WE'RE STILL DOING TO FIX LOCAL

04:14:57.149 --> 04:14:59.718 region:rollup2
CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA TO MAKE

04:14:58.416 --> 04:15:01.386 region:rollup2
IT THE BEST POLICY.

04:14:59.718 --> 04:15:03.054 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE UP BUT THAT'S WHAT

04:15:01.386 --> 04:15:03.755 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO HERE AND

04:15:03.054 --> 04:15:05.357 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT.

04:15:03.755 --> 04:15:07.425 region:rollup2
THE RISK ASSESSMENT IS A FAR

04:15:05.357 --> 04:15:08.994 region:rollup2
BETTER TOOL THAN BEING ABLE TO

04:15:07.425 --> 04:15:10.362 region:rollup2
AFFORD A BAIL THE BAIL YOURSELF

04:15:08.994 --> 04:15:12.097 region:rollup2
OUT OF JAIL I THINK IT'S SAFER

04:15:10.362 --> 04:15:13.565 region:rollup2
FOR OUR COMMUNITIES I FEEL SAFER

04:15:12.097 --> 04:15:14.1000 region:rollup2

NOTHING'S EVER PERFECT BUT I

04:15:23.809 --> 04:15:26.611 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S A GOOD FIRST STEP AND

04:15:25.510 --> 04:15:27.746 region:rollup2
WE CAN'T BE AFRAID OF CHANGE

04:15:26.611 --> 04:15:29.014 region:rollup2

04:18:55.854 --> 04:18:59.624 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WILL BE THE WAY TO GO

04:18:57.655 --> 04:19:00.625 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY.

04:18:59.624 --> 04:19:00.925 region:rollup2

04:19:00.625 --> 04:19:02.360 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

04:19:00.925 --> 04:19:04.262 region:rollup2
SPECIALLY [inaudible]

04:19:02.360 --> 04:19:06.331 region:rollup2
THIS BODY.

04:19:04.262 --> 04:19:07.565 region:rollup2
PUTS THE ELBOW GREASE IT NEEDS

04:19:06.331 --> 04:19:10.702 region:rollup2
TO ENSURE.

04:19:07.565 --> 04:19:12.937 region:rollup2
THAT THAT SYSTEM OFFSETS THE

04:19:10.702 --> 04:19:14.672 region:rollup2
JUDGES MADE TO ASSESS WHAT LAW

04:19:12.937 --> 04:19:17.442 region:rollup2
MY FIRST* WILL DO BUT

04:19:14.672 --> 04:19:18.676 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY WILL ENSURE.

04:19:17.442 --> 04:19:21.112 region:rollup2
I WILL SAY THIS AGAIN WILL

04:19:18.676 --> 04:19:25.817 region:rollup2
ENSURE THE SAFETY.

04:19:21.112 --> 04:19:27.085 region:rollup2
OF EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA.

04:19:25.817 --> 04:19:28.520 region:rollup2
DISPEL DOES NOT SOLVE ALL THE

04:19:27.085 --> 04:19:31.990 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS WITH OUR PANEL JUSTICE

04:19:28.520 --> 04:19:32.757 region:rollup2
SYSTEM BUT IT BRINGS ECONOMIC

04:19:31.990 --> 04:19:34.926 region:rollup2
JUSTICE TO THE CURRENT SYSTEM.

04:19:32.757 --> 04:19:37.829 region:rollup2
WE CAN DISAGREE ABOUT WHAT MAY

04:19:34.926 --> 04:19:39.330 region:rollup2
HAPPEN IF THIS BILL PASSES.

04:19:37.829 --> 04:19:41.132 region:rollup2
BUT HERE'S ONE THING WE CAN ALL

04:19:39.330 --> 04:19:43.668 region:rollup2
AGREE.

04:19:41.132 --> 04:19:46.905 region:rollup2
THAT BILL WILL DEFINITELY.

04:19:43.668 --> 04:19:49.741 region:rollup2
AND A LEGALIZED FORM OF ECONOMIC

04:19:46.905 --> 04:19:52.143 region:rollup2
DISCRIMINATION BY ELIMINATING

04:19:49.741 --> 04:19:54.579 region:rollup2
CASH BAIL IN CALIFORNIA.

04:19:52.143 --> 04:19:56.548 region:rollup2
THIS BILL IS A FIRST STEP.

04:19:54.579 --> 04:19:59.884 region:rollup2

IS THAT ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION.

04:19:59.884 --> 04:20:03.621 region:rollup2
SAY IT ALL THE TIME IT'S REALLY

04:20:01.686 --> 04:20:05.356 region:rollup2
NOT ABOUT LEGISLATION IT'S ABOUT

04:20:03.621 --> 04:20:07.559 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION IF YOU DON'T SEE

04:20:05.356 --> 04:20:10.361 region:rollup2

THAT WHEN WE COME BACK.

04:20:14.599 --> 04:20:19.003 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO HAVE TO

04:20:16.401 --> 04:20:20.338 region:rollup2
HAVE LEGISLATION TO IMPROVE THIS

04:20:19.003 --> 04:20:21.773 region:rollup2
AGAIN AND AGAIN.

04:20:20.338 --> 04:20:23.241 region:rollup2
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT A FOR TWO

DEMOCRACY AS A GEORGE WILL WANT

04:22:04.209 --> 04:22:08.513 region:rollup2

IMPORTANT ISSUE IMPORTANT ENOUGH

04:22:16.921 --> 04:22:21.492 region:rollup2
FOR THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF OUR

ALL OF US.

04:22:32.971 --> 04:22:36.341 region:rollup2

FAIRER.

04:22:47.752 --> 04:22:52.190 region:rollup2
THAT IS A RISK BASED SYSTEM NOT

04:22:50.321 --> 04:22:53.958 region:rollup2
A MONEY BASED SYSTEM AND UNDER

04:22:52.190 --> 04:22:55.393 region:rollup2

AND THOSE CONSEQUENCES ARE THAT

04:23:23.054 --> 04:23:28.860 region:rollup2
PEOPLE AND THESE ARE PRIMARILY

04:23:26.491 --> 04:23:31.329 region:rollup2

AND THERE WILL BE LITTLE HOPE

04:23:41.372 --> 04:23:45.343 region:rollup2
FOR CHANGE IN THE FORESEEABLE

04:23:42.473 --> 04:23:46.310 region:rollup2

04:25:55.206 --> 04:25:59.844 region:rollup2
SUFFER UNDER OUR CURRENT SYSTEM

04:25:59.544 --> 04:26:04.348 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

04:25:59.844 --> 04:26:10.555 region:rollup2
SO [inaudible]

04:26:04.348 --> 04:26:12.356 region:rollup2
IT SAID CRAPPIE PROCESS.

04:26:10.555 --> 04:26:17.595 region:rollup2
BUT I FEEL THE RIGHT THING TO DO

04:26:12.356 --> 04:26:19.397 region:rollup2
IS TO SUPPORT THIS BILL.

04:26:17.595 --> 04:26:20.565 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I KNOW.

04:26:19.397 --> 04:26:22.900 region:rollup2
HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO ACHIEVE

04:26:20.565 --> 04:26:27.405 region:rollup2
CHANGE?

04:26:22.900 --> 04:26:28.940 region:rollup2
I KNOW AS A FORMER PROSECUTOR.

04:26:27.405 --> 04:26:30.508 region:rollup2
HOW PEOPLE ARE HELD BECAUSE THEY

04:26:28.940 --> 04:26:32.777 region:rollup2
CAN'T [inaudible]

04:26:30.508 --> 04:26:34.045 region:rollup2
AFFORD BAIL.

04:26:32.777 --> 04:26:35.146 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE AS A FORMER PROSECUTOR

04:26:34.045 --> 04:26:37.748 region:rollup2
THAT [inaudible]

04:26:35.146 --> 04:26:39.550 region:rollup2
THIS WILL HELP.

04:26:37.748 --> 04:26:40.985 region:rollup2
STRENGTHENED PUBLIC SAFETY IT

04:26:39.550 --> 04:26:43.120 region:rollup2
WILL GIVE OPPORTUNITIES TO

04:26:40.985 --> 04:26:44.488 region:rollup2
VICTIMS OF CRIME. TO TELL US

04:26:43.120 --> 04:26:48.860 region:rollup2
FIND THESE PRE TRIAL ASSESSMENT

04:26:44.488 --> 04:26:50.628 region:rollup2
HEARINGS.

04:26:48.860 --> 04:26:52.597 region:rollup2
THE CRAPPY BILL AND IT'S GONNA

04:26:50.628 --> 04:26:53.798 region:rollup2
NEED A LOT OF FIXES.

04:26:52.597 --> 04:26:55.333 region:rollup2
AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING

04:26:53.798 --> 04:26:57.034 region:rollup2
WITH ALL THOSE FIXES BUT I'M

04:26:55.333 --> 04:26:59.003 region:rollup2
AFRAID THAT IF WE DON'T BUT ON

04:26:57.034 --> 04:27:01.839 region:rollup2
THIS BILL NOW IT'S NOT GOING TO

04:26:59.003 --> 04:27:03.374 region:rollup2
PASS ON TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL.

04:27:01.839 --> 04:27:07.111 region:rollup2
THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER

04:27:03.374 --> 04:27:07.745 region:rollup2
YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

04:27:07.111 --> 04:27:10.348 region:rollup2
YES MADAM SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES

04:27:07.745 --> 04:27:12.850 region:rollup2
--

04:27:10.348 --> 04:27:14.852 region:rollup2
LIKE SO MANY OF YOU KNOW I RISE

04:27:12.850 --> 04:27:16.354 region:rollup2
TO SUPPORT THIS BILL WITH.

04:27:14.852 --> 04:27:17.955 region:rollup2
ALWAYS WITH SOME CONCERNS

04:27:16.354 --> 04:27:20.758 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT IS A MAJOR STEP FOR

04:27:17.955 --> 04:27:22.727 region:rollup2
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

04:27:20.758 --> 04:27:23.694 region:rollup2
YOU MY FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH THE

04:27:22.727 --> 04:27:25.663 region:rollup2
CONCEPT OF BAIL.

04:27:23.694 --> 04:27:27.732 region:rollup2
WAS WHEN I WAS A KID.

04:27:25.663 --> 04:27:29.567 region:rollup2
AND MY FATHER GOT A CALL TO HELP

04:27:27.732 --> 04:27:31.936 region:rollup2
BAIL SOMEBODY OUT OF JAIL.

04:27:29.567 --> 04:27:33.804 region:rollup2
THEN THE WHAT THE HECK THAT WAS.

04:27:31.936 --> 04:27:35.573 region:rollup2
BUT HE'D NEVER JOEY DIDN'T BILL

04:27:33.804 --> 04:27:37.041 region:rollup2
A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT OF JAIL.

04:27:35.573 --> 04:27:38.743 region:rollup2
WE HAD A PERSON WHO HAD GOTTEN

04:27:37.041 --> 04:27:40.111 region:rollup2
INTO JAIL BECAUSE I DON'T NO

04:27:38.743 --> 04:27:41.812 region:rollup2
THEY WERE GAMBLING OR SOMETHING

04:27:40.111 --> 04:27:43.481 region:rollup2
THAT ONE OF THE GAMBLING PARTIES

04:27:41.812 --> 04:27:45.816 region:rollup2
IN THE PLEASE USE TO RAID THE

04:27:43.481 --> 04:27:47.952 region:rollup2
PLACE TO TAKE THESE FOLKS JAIL.

04:27:45.816 --> 04:27:49.387 region:rollup2
MY FATHER HAD TO A DECIDED TO

04:27:47.952 --> 04:27:51.088 region:rollup2
GIVE TO THIS BRAILLE FUND FOR

04:27:49.387 --> 04:27:51.989 region:rollup2
THIS PERSON HE SAID BECAUSE YOU

04:27:51.088 --> 04:27:53.424 region:rollup2
KNOW.

04:27:51.989 --> 04:27:55.559 region:rollup2
IF HE DOESN'T GET OUT OF JAIL

04:27:53.424 --> 04:27:56.093 region:rollup2
THIS WEEKEND HE WON'T HAVE A JOB

04:27:55.559 --> 04:27:57.328 region:rollup2
ON MONDAY WHEN BOTH MISTER

04:27:56.093 --> 04:27:59.564 region:rollup2
CHARLIE.

04:27:57.328 --> 04:28:00.998 region:rollup2
HE'LL LOSE HIS JOB.

04:27:59.564 --> 04:28:02.667 region:rollup2
AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS KIND OF

04:28:00.998 --> 04:28:04.568 region:rollup2
UNUSUAL BECAUSE THAT UNDERSTAND

04:28:02.667 --> 04:28:05.603 region:rollup2
THAT AT THE TIME AS A KID.

04:28:04.568 --> 04:28:07.838 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THE

04:28:05.603 --> 04:28:09.340 region:rollup2
ELEMENTS OF POVERTY.

04:28:07.838 --> 04:28:11.008 region:rollup2
BUT IF YOU ARE GENERALLY IN A

04:28:09.340 --> 04:28:13.044 region:rollup2
SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE THESE

04:28:11.008 --> 04:28:14.378 region:rollup2
JOBS THAT ARE KIND OF LOW WAGE

04:28:13.044 --> 04:28:16.213 region:rollup2
JOBS WOULD ALSO JOBS WITHOUT A

04:28:14.378 --> 04:28:17.582 region:rollup2
LOT OF BENEFITS.

04:28:16.213 --> 04:28:19.750 region:rollup2
IT YOU THEN BECOME THE VICTIM OF

04:28:17.582 --> 04:28:20.351 region:rollup2
A HOST OF THINGS.

04:28:19.750 --> 04:28:21.852 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THOSE IS A BRAILLE

04:28:20.351 --> 04:28:23.554 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

04:28:21.852 --> 04:28:25.222 region:rollup2
AND SO MY DAD WOULD ALWAYS SAY I

04:28:23.554 --> 04:28:26.757 region:rollup2
DON'T BILL EVERYBODY OUT OF JAIL

04:28:25.222 --> 04:28:28.059 region:rollup2
BUT IF YOU HAVE A JOB I'M GOING

04:28:26.757 --> 04:28:29.627 region:rollup2
TO BAIL YOU OUT OF JAIL THIS IS

04:28:28.059 --> 04:28:31.996 region:rollup2
A POOR MAN TALKING.

04:28:29.627 --> 04:28:32.563 region:rollup2
ABOUT GIVING TWENTY FIVE THIRTY

04:28:31.996 --> 04:28:33.831 region:rollup2
FORTY FIFTY DOLLARS TO BAIL

04:28:32.563 --> 04:28:35.466 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

04:28:33.831 --> 04:28:36.734 region:rollup2
BECAUSE HE WANTED TO MAKE SURE

04:28:35.466 --> 04:28:38.869 region:rollup2
THAT THIS PERSON HAD A JOB ONE

04:28:36.734 --> 04:28:40.004 region:rollup2
MONDAY MORNING.

04:28:38.869 --> 04:28:41.906 region:rollup2
AND SO WHEN I BEGAN TO

04:28:40.004 --> 04:28:43.641 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND EVEN LATER.

04:28:41.906 --> 04:28:44.775 region:rollup2
AND EVEN NOW THE LEGISLATIVE WE

04:28:43.641 --> 04:28:46.077 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE ISSUES THAT HAVE

04:28:44.775 --> 04:28:47.678 region:rollup2
BEEN RAISED BY OUR SUPREME COURT

04:28:46.077 --> 04:28:49.080 region:rollup2
JUSTICE.

04:28:47.678 --> 04:28:50.481 region:rollup2
AND ALL OF THE JUDGES AROUND THE

04:28:49.080 --> 04:28:52.249 region:rollup2
STATE WILL CONSERVATIVE AS WELL

04:28:50.481 --> 04:28:53.884 region:rollup2
AS SOME LIBERAL ONES.

04:28:52.249 --> 04:28:55.152 region:rollup2
THE CONCERN WAS ALWAYS ABOUT THE

04:28:53.884 --> 04:28:56.520 region:rollup2
FACT THAT THIS SYSTEM WAS SO

04:28:55.152 --> 04:28:59.123 region:rollup2
OFTEN FEAR.

04:28:56.520 --> 04:29:00.691 region:rollup2
AND SO ON JUST TO POOR PEOPLE.

04:28:59.123 --> 04:29:01.692 region:rollup2
WHO DIDN'T HAVE THE MEANS TO

04:29:00.691 --> 04:29:02.593 region:rollup2
BAIL FOLKS OUT OF JAIL WHO

04:29:01.692 --> 04:29:04.362 region:rollup2
DIDN'T HAVE CREDIT CARDS TO GET

04:29:02.593 --> 04:29:05.496 region:rollup2
PEOPLE OUT?

04:29:04.362 --> 04:29:06.964 region:rollup2
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WANT TO

04:29:05.496 --> 04:29:08.766 region:rollup2
BAIL SOMEONE OUT THAT MONEY IS

04:29:06.964 --> 04:29:11.002 region:rollup2
GONE.

04:29:08.766 --> 04:29:11.769 region:rollup2
YOU DO NOT GET IT BACK.

04:29:11.002 --> 04:29:14.305 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T PAID THE

04:29:11.769 --> 04:29:15.873 region:rollup2
FULL AMOUNT OF ONLY PAY 10%.

04:29:14.305 --> 04:29:18.509 region:rollup2
AND THAT 10% IS GONE TO SOMEONE

04:29:15.873 --> 04:29:19.777 region:rollup2
ELSE WHY BECAUSE YOU ARE IN A

04:29:18.509 --> 04:29:20.845 region:rollup2
SITUATION THAT YOU WEREN'T

04:29:19.777 --> 04:29:22.680 region:rollup2
HURTING SOMEONE YOU WEREN'T

04:29:20.845 --> 04:29:23.848 region:rollup2
DOING ANYTHING DIFFERENT THAN

04:29:22.680 --> 04:29:25.616 region:rollup2
YOU NORMALLY DO MAYBE.

04:29:23.848 --> 04:29:27.718 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU END UP IN JAIL AND YOU

04:29:25.616 --> 04:29:29.453 region:rollup2
NEEDED THE BILL YOURSELF OUT?

04:29:27.718 --> 04:29:30.421 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT A PERFECT SYSTEM AND

04:29:29.453 --> 04:29:32.523 region:rollup2
I HAVE GREAT CONCERNS ABOUT THIS

04:29:30.421 --> 04:29:33.858 region:rollup2
BILL.

04:29:32.523 --> 04:29:35.659 region:rollup2
GREAT CONCERNS ABOUT THE ISSUE

04:29:33.858 --> 04:29:36.961 region:rollup2
OF SOCIAL JUSTICE.

04:29:35.659 --> 04:29:38.562 region:rollup2
BECAUSE UNLIKE WHAT SOME OF YOU

04:29:36.961 --> 04:29:40.464 region:rollup2
SAID THIS IS GOING TO GIVE MORE

04:29:38.562 --> 04:29:41.966 region:rollup2
POWER TO OUR JUDGES.

04:29:40.464 --> 04:29:42.967 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY MAKE A DECISION ABOUT

04:29:41.966 --> 04:29:44.435 region:rollup2
WHO GETS THAT WHO WHO GETS OUT

04:29:42.967 --> 04:29:46.203 region:rollup2
OF JAIL.

04:29:44.435 --> 04:29:47.705 region:rollup2
AND SO THIS POSITION THAT IT'S

04:29:46.203 --> 04:29:49.507 region:rollup2
NICE TAKEN AWAY FROM THE JUDGES

04:29:47.705 --> 04:29:50.941 region:rollup2
THIS IS ACTUALLY GIVING MORE.

04:29:49.507 --> 04:29:52.676 region:rollup2
AND THE SOCIAL JUSTICE GROUPS

04:29:50.941 --> 04:29:54.045 region:rollup2
LIKE THE IN DOUBLE ACP IN A CEO

04:29:52.676 --> 04:29:55.379 region:rollup2
YOUR CONCERN.

04:29:54.045 --> 04:29:57.214 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT I JUDGE

04:29:55.379 --> 04:29:58.716 region:rollup2
SYSTEM A JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS NOT

04:29:57.214 --> 04:29:59.450 region:rollup2
THAT PERFECT.

04:29:58.716 --> 04:30:02.019 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S STILL TREMENDOUS

04:29:59.450 --> 04:30:03.320 region:rollup2
BIAS IN OUR DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S

04:30:02.019 --> 04:30:05.156 region:rollup2
AND HOW THEY CHARGE POOR PEOPLE

04:30:03.320 --> 04:30:06.657 region:rollup2
FOR HIGHER CRIMES.

04:30:05.156 --> 04:30:07.992 region:rollup2
AND IS STILL BIAS IN OUR JUDGES

04:30:06.657 --> 04:30:09.193 region:rollup2
WHO LOOK AT PEOPLE OF COLOR AND

04:30:07.992 --> 04:30:10.828 region:rollup2
PEOPLE PORT DIFFERENTLY THAN

04:30:09.193 --> 04:30:11.762 region:rollup2
THEY DO OTHERS.

04:30:10.828 --> 04:30:13.264 region:rollup2
AND AS A RESULT THERE MAY BE

04:30:11.762 --> 04:30:14.331 region:rollup2
SOME BIAS.

04:30:13.264 --> 04:30:15.633 region:rollup2
IT IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE A LOT

04:30:14.331 --> 04:30:17.301 region:rollup2
OF WORK TO DO IN ORDER TO MAKE

04:30:15.633 --> 04:30:19.703 region:rollup2
SURE THIS BILL IS THE FUNCTIONS

04:30:17.301 --> 04:30:21.405 region:rollup2
THE WAY WE WANT IT TO FUNCTION.

04:30:19.703 --> 04:30:23.407 region:rollup2
BUT I'VE LEARNED THAT.

04:30:21.405 --> 04:30:24.875 region:rollup2
ALL ALL THE YEARS OF MY LIFE.

04:30:23.407 --> 04:30:27.144 region:rollup2
THAT CHANGES FAR.

04:30:24.875 --> 04:30:29.480 region:rollup2
IT IS DIFFICULT.

04:30:27.144 --> 04:30:32.349 region:rollup2
AND OFTEN TIMES OUT OF OUR FEAR

04:30:29.480 --> 04:30:34.351 region:rollup2
OF CHANGE THAT WE DO NOTHING.

04:30:32.349 --> 04:30:35.653 region:rollup2
WE JUST STAND STILL.

04:30:34.351 --> 04:30:37.888 region:rollup2
AND WE FIND EVERY REASON NOT TO

04:30:35.653 --> 04:30:39.190 region:rollup2
CHANGE.

04:30:37.888 --> 04:30:41.692 region:rollup2
AND THINGS DON'T GET BETTER.

04:30:39.190 --> 04:30:43.461 region:rollup2
THEY GET WORSE.

04:30:41.692 --> 04:30:45.529 region:rollup2
AND REQUIRE SOME TIME SOME

04:30:43.461 --> 04:30:47.298 region:rollup2
COURAGE TO STEP FORWARD. TO NOT

04:30:45.529 --> 04:30:49.967 region:rollup2
ONLY MAKE THE CHANGE WOULD WORK

04:30:47.298 --> 04:30:51.502 region:rollup2
TO MAKE THAT CHANGE WORK RIGHT.

04:30:49.967 --> 04:30:53.404 region:rollup2
I CAN REMEMBER WHEN BROWN VERSUS

04:30:51.502 --> 04:30:55.239 region:rollup2
BOARD OF EDUCATION NINETEEN

04:30:53.404 --> 04:30:56.540 region:rollup2
FIFTY FOUR'S DECISION WAS DONE.

04:30:55.239 --> 04:30:57.875 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WERE CONCERNED THAT THIS

04:30:56.540 --> 04:30:59.744 region:rollup2
WAS MOVING TOO FAST AND WE

04:30:57.875 --> 04:31:01.212 region:rollup2
NEEDED TO SLOW DOWN.

04:30:59.744 --> 04:31:02.646 region:rollup2
AND YOU LEARN VERY QUICKLY THAT

04:31:01.212 --> 04:31:04.715 region:rollup2
THIS WAS REALLY A SMALL STEP IN

04:31:02.646 --> 04:31:14.158 region:rollup2
THE INTEGRATION.

04:31:04.715 --> 04:31:14.792 region:rollup2
IT WASN'T THE BE ALL END ALL.

04:31:14.158 --> 04:31:15.426 region:rollup2
AND IT REQUIRED LOTS OF WORK

04:31:14.792 --> 04:31:16.026 region:rollup2
AFTERWARDS AND STILL TO THIS DAY

04:31:15.426 --> 04:31:16.360 region:rollup2
IT IS NOT THE PERFECT SYSTEM

04:31:16.026 --> 04:31:16.994 region:rollup2
THAT WE WANT.

04:31:16.360 --> 04:31:17.661 region:rollup2
AND WHEN I LOOK AT ALL THOSE

04:31:16.994 --> 04:31:18.262 region:rollup2
THINGS WE'VE DONE IN THIS HOUSE

04:31:17.661 --> 04:31:18.863 region:rollup2
AND FOR THE LAST FIFTY SIXTY

04:31:18.262 --> 04:31:19.864 region:rollup2
YEARS OF IT IN LAW ISSUE OF

04:31:18.863 --> 04:31:23.033 region:rollup2
SOCIAL JUSTICE.

04:31:19.864 --> 04:31:24.435 region:rollup2
WE'VE HAD SMALL STEPS TINY STEPS

04:31:23.033 --> 04:31:26.237 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES FOR STEP FORWARD TWO

04:31:24.435 --> 04:31:28.405 region:rollup2
STEPS BACK.

04:31:26.237 --> 04:31:30.074 region:rollup2
STILL MOVING FORWARD.

04:31:28.405 --> 04:31:31.842 region:rollup2
WILL YOU AN IMPERFECT WORLD THIS

04:31:30.074 --> 04:31:33.344 region:rollup2
IN AN IMPERFECT SYSTEM THAT'S

04:31:31.842 --> 04:31:35.946 region:rollup2
WHAT DEMOCRACY IS BUT IT

04:31:33.344 --> 04:31:37.548 region:rollup2
REQUIRES US TO HAVE SOME FAITH.

04:31:35.946 --> 04:31:39.283 region:rollup2
SOME COURAGE THAT WHEN WE FIND

04:31:37.548 --> 04:31:40.718 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WRONG.

04:31:39.283 --> 04:31:42.720 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S NOT A PERSON ON THIS

04:31:40.718 --> 04:31:44.488 region:rollup2
FLOOR WHO SAID MONEY BAIL IS A

04:31:42.720 --> 04:31:46.924 region:rollup2
GOOD THING.

04:31:44.488 --> 04:31:48.659 region:rollup2
WE ALL SAID IT IS WRONG.

04:31:46.924 --> 04:31:50.594 region:rollup2
MOST OF US HAVE DONE NOTHING TO

04:31:48.659 --> 04:31:52.196 region:rollup2
CHANGE IT THOUGH.

04:31:50.594 --> 04:31:53.397 region:rollup2
WE HAVE NOT ORGANIZE WE HAVE NOT

04:31:52.196 --> 04:31:55.065 region:rollup2
PUT FORTH FORTH A BILL WE HAVE

04:31:53.397 --> 04:31:56.867 region:rollup2
NOT ACTUALLY MOVED TO BAKE BUDDY

04:31:55.065 --> 04:31:57.368 region:rollup2
BILL.

04:31:56.867 --> 04:31:59.036 region:rollup2
I TAKE BUT A BILL OUT OF

04:31:57.368 --> 04:31:59.637 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

04:31:59.036 --> 04:32:01.138 region:rollup2
SO NOW WE HAVE SOME FOLKS WHO

04:31:59.637 --> 04:32:02.506 region:rollup2
HAVE.

04:32:01.138 --> 04:32:03.407 region:rollup2
AND THEY SPENT TWO YEARS SO

04:32:02.506 --> 04:32:05.075 region:rollup2
ANYONE WHO SAYS THIS JUST POPPED

04:32:03.407 --> 04:32:07.211 region:rollup2
UP NO MAYBE THE CONCEPT OF WAR

04:32:05.075 --> 04:32:08.145 region:rollup2
POPPED UP.

04:32:07.211 --> 04:32:08.779 region:rollup2
BUT REMEMBER WE HAVE A LOT OF

04:32:08.145 --> 04:32:10.581 region:rollup2
THIS THERE'S SOMETHING AS BEING

04:32:08.779 --> 04:32:11.148 region:rollup2
PREFACE EVERY TWO HOURS AND

04:32:10.581 --> 04:32:12.249 region:rollup2
WE'VE DONE THAT THEY'VE DONE

04:32:11.148 --> 04:32:14.018 region:rollup2
THAT.

04:32:12.249 --> 04:32:15.486 region:rollup2
AND SO YOU HAD ITS BENEFITS

04:32:14.018 --> 04:32:17.354 region:rollup2
SEVENTY TWO HOURS USE IT IF YOU

04:32:15.486 --> 04:32:19.089 region:rollup2
WANTED TO SEE IT IT'S BEEN HERE.

04:32:17.354 --> 04:32:20.724 region:rollup2
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY FOLKS HAVE

04:32:19.089 --> 04:32:22.159 region:rollup2
DECIDED THAT THEY'RE NO LONGER

04:32:20.724 --> 04:32:23.527 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE AFRAID.

04:32:22.159 --> 04:32:25.229 region:rollup2

04:32:23.527 --> 04:32:26.897 region:rollup2
BY FEAR.

04:32:25.229 --> 04:32:28.799 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY TRY TO MOVE FORWARD TO

04:32:26.897 --> 04:32:30.234 region:rollup2
BRING SOME CHANGE BECAUSE

04:32:28.799 --> 04:32:32.703 region:rollup2
EVERYONE ON THIS FLOOR HAS SAID

04:32:30.234 --> 04:32:34.672 region:rollup2
MONEY BAIL IS WRONG.

04:32:32.703 --> 04:32:36.373 region:rollup2
IT IS NOT A GOOD SYSTEM IT IS

04:32:34.672 --> 04:32:37.708 region:rollup2
NOT A SYSTEM THAT KEEPS US SAFE

04:32:36.373 --> 04:32:39.443 region:rollup2
AND IS SURELY IS UNFAIR AND

04:32:37.708 --> 04:32:40.477 region:rollup2
UNJUST TO THOSE WHO PROBABLY

04:32:39.443 --> 04:32:41.679 region:rollup2
NEED JUSTICE MORE THAN ANYONE

04:32:40.477 --> 04:32:43.047 region:rollup2
ELSE.

04:32:41.679 --> 04:32:44.982 region:rollup2

DO WHAT IS RIGHT WHAT IS JUST

04:32:50.020 --> 04:32:52.590 region:rollup2
AND THAT IT MOVES CALIFORNIA IN

04:32:51.188 --> 04:32:53.657 region:rollup2
A POSITION THAT WE HAVEN'T HAD

04:32:52.590 --> 04:32:56.160 region:rollup2
BEFORE.

04:32:53.657 --> 04:32:57.828 region:rollup2

TO TELL US TO BOW IN SUPPORT OF

04:33:25.089 --> 04:33:26.957 region:rollup2
THIS BILL.

04:33:26.423 --> 04:33:29.426 region:rollup2
HAS ESSENTIALLY MADE THIS

04:33:26.957 --> 04:33:31.629 region:rollup2
ARGUMENT --

04:33:29.426 --> 04:33:32.730 region:rollup2
YEAH THIS COULD BE REALLY BAD.

04:33:31.629 --> 04:33:36.300 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S BETTER THAN THE STATUS

04:33:32.730 --> 04:33:37.368 region:rollup2
QUO. TO PASS BAD POLICY IN HEY

04:33:36.300 --> 04:33:38.903 region:rollup2
WE COULD MAYBE FIX THAT BAD

04:33:37.368 --> 04:33:40.504 region:rollup2
POLICY.

04:33:38.903 --> 04:33:41.405 region:rollup2
DOWN THE ROAD WHY DON'T WE JUST

04:33:40.504 --> 04:33:43.307 region:rollup2
DO IT THE RIGHT WAY.

04:33:41.405 --> 04:33:44.308 region:rollup2
THE FIRST TIME.

04:33:43.307 --> 04:33:46.277 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THE POINT THAT

04:33:44.308 --> 04:33:47.645 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY'S MAKING.

04:33:46.277 --> 04:33:49.046 region:rollup2
ON THE OPPOSITION SIDE WHY

04:33:52.316 --> 04:33:55.619 region:rollup2
MENDOZA YOU ARE MAKING THE

04:33:53.917 --> 04:33:58.055 region:rollup2
ARGUMENT THAT THIS IS BAD --

04:33:55.619 --> 04:33:59.423 region:rollup2
THIS IS BAD PROCESS.

04:33:58.055 --> 04:34:01.659 region:rollup2
YOU CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT

04:33:59.423 --> 04:34:03.294 region:rollup2

FORWARDING LEGISLATION TO THE

04:34:07.264 --> 04:34:11.902 region:rollup2
FLOOR THAT NOBODY'S HAVE THE

04:34:07.831 --> 04:34:12.936 region:rollup2
TIME. TO REALLY DEVOID TO READ.

04:34:11.902 --> 04:34:14.571 region:rollup2
THAT NO COMMITTEES HAVE REALLY

04:34:12.936 --> 04:34:16.774 region:rollup2
HAD THE PROCESS TO DELIBERATE

04:34:14.571 --> 04:34:18.075 region:rollup2
AND DISCUSS.

04:34:16.774 --> 04:34:19.576 region:rollup2

RESULTS THAT LIKE THAT YOU'RE

04:34:19.576 --> 04:34:22.579 region:rollup2

CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN THIS WAY.

04:34:29.320 --> 04:34:31.655 region:rollup2
AND MANY OF THE THINGS I'VE

04:34:30.521 --> 04:34:33.524 region:rollup2
HEARD ON THIS FLOOR JUST PURE

04:34:31.655 --> 04:34:34.758 region:rollup2
FANTASY.

LIKE THAT WE'VE BEEN DEBATING

04:34:34.758 --> 04:34:37.728 region:rollup2
THIS ARE YOU KIDDING ME.

04:34:36.327 --> 04:34:39.396 region:rollup2
THE LAST TIME WE HAD A DEBATE ON

04:34:37.728 --> 04:34:40.331 region:rollup2
THIS WAS LAST YEAR ON THE FLOOR

04:34:39.396 --> 04:34:43.100 region:rollup2

04:34:40.331 --> 04:34:44.001 region:rollup2
END THE SESSION.

04:34:43.100 --> 04:34:44.301 region:rollup2
TRIED TO PUT SOME THROUGH WE

04:34:44.001 --> 04:34:45.903 region:rollup2
DIDN'T GET.

04:34:44.301 --> 04:34:47.971 region:rollup2
LUCKILY.

04:34:53.210 --> 04:34:55.946 region:rollup2
WE HAD A BILL THAT.

04:34:54.812 --> 04:34:58.782 region:rollup2
HAD LANGUAGE IT WAS COMPLETELY

04:34:55.946 --> 04:35:00.751 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT.

04:34:58.782 --> 04:35:01.885 region:rollup2
AS LATE AS LAST THURSDAY.

04:35:00.751 --> 04:35:03.520 region:rollup2
LAST THURSDAY WAS A COMPLETELY

04:35:01.885 --> 04:35:04.888 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT BILL.

04:35:03.520 --> 04:35:06.123 region:rollup2

THE WEEKEND.

04:35:08.092 --> 04:35:11.061 region:rollup2
AND NOW IT'S A COMPLETELY

04:35:09.159 --> 04:35:12.796 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT BILL.

04:35:11.061 --> 04:35:13.998 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE TOLD YEAH GO AHEAD AND

04:35:12.796 --> 04:35:15.699 region:rollup2
BONES AND APPROVE THE SAYING IN

04:35:13.998 --> 04:35:17.868 region:rollup2
AND LET'S MOVE FORWARD.

04:35:15.699 --> 04:35:19.436 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT A GOOD WAY. TO MAKE

04:35:17.868 --> 04:35:20.704 region:rollup2
GOOD POLICY NOW FROM WHAT I CAN.

04:35:19.436 --> 04:35:22.005 region:rollup2
HAVE READ THE BILL THERE'S

04:35:20.704 --> 04:35:23.907 region:rollup2
THERE'S A MAJOR PROBLEMS HERE

04:35:22.005 --> 04:35:25.008 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY DOES AGREE.

04:35:23.907 --> 04:35:27.277 region:rollup2
THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS

04:35:25.008 --> 04:35:28.946 region:rollup2
FLAWED THERE'S INEQUITIES.

04:35:27.277 --> 04:35:30.914 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT THE OP USER THING THE

04:35:28.946 --> 04:35:32.316 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION DOESN'T DISAGREE.

04:35:30.914 --> 04:35:33.917 region:rollup2
THE OPPOSITION ACTUALLY AGREES

04:35:32.316 --> 04:35:34.385 region:rollup2
ON THIS POINT THIS WILL PROBABLY

04:35:33.917 --> 04:35:38.088 region:rollup2
LEAD TO ACTUALLY MORE

04:35:34.385 --> 04:35:39.022 region:rollup2
DETENTIONS.

04:35:38.088 --> 04:35:40.124 region:rollup2
NO PRIOR ACTUALLY TO MORE

04:35:39.022 --> 04:35:41.959 region:rollup2
DETENTIONS AND WHEN YOU DO RISK

04:35:40.124 --> 04:35:43.694 region:rollup2
BASE.

04:35:41.959 --> 04:35:45.295 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENTS IT DEPENDS ON HOW

04:35:43.694 --> 04:35:47.164 region:rollup2
YOU DO THAT CRITERIA AND YOU'RE

04:35:45.295 --> 04:35:48.966 region:rollup2
GIVING THAT AWAY. TO ANOTHER

04:35:47.164 --> 04:35:49.733 region:rollup2
BODY NOT THIS BODY.

04:35:48.966 --> 04:35:51.502 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GONNA DETERMINE WHAT

04:35:49.733 --> 04:35:52.970 region:rollup2
THAT RISK ASSESSMENT IS AND

04:35:51.502 --> 04:35:54.405 region:rollup2
DEPENDING ON HOW THEY DO IT

04:35:52.970 --> 04:35:55.305 region:rollup2
THOSE INEQUITIES THAT YOU'VE

04:35:54.405 --> 04:35:57.341 region:rollup2
SEEN ACTUALLY COULD BE

04:35:55.305 --> 04:35:58.609 region:rollup2
EXACERBATED.

04:35:57.341 --> 04:35:59.410 region:rollup2
SO FOR THOSE OF YOU ARE SAYING

04:35:58.609 --> 04:36:00.811 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO SOLVE THE

04:35:59.410 --> 04:36:03.013 region:rollup2
INEQUITIES WE'RE GOING TO STOP

04:36:00.811 --> 04:36:04.515 region:rollup2
UNFAIR DETENTION.

04:36:03.013 --> 04:36:06.216 region:rollup2
YOU MAY DO VERY VERY THE

04:36:04.515 --> 04:36:07.451 region:rollup2
OPPOSITE WITH THIS AND YOU HAVE

04:36:06.216 --> 04:36:09.086 region:rollup2
NO CONTROL OVER IT BECAUSE THE

04:36:07.451 --> 04:36:12.022 region:rollup2
JUDICIAL COUNCIL IS GOING TO

04:36:09.086 --> 04:36:13.557 region:rollup2
COME OF THAT CRITERIA NOT YOU.

04:36:12.022 --> 04:36:14.758 region:rollup2
AND SO YOU SHOULD REALLY THINK

04:36:13.557 --> 04:36:16.527 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT THE OTHER THING

04:36:14.758 --> 04:36:16.994 region:rollup2
YOU'RE YOU ARE ELIMINATING.

04:36:16.527 --> 04:36:19.530 region:rollup2
AN ENTIRE INDUSTRY IN

04:36:16.994 --> 04:36:21.565 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

04:36:19.530 --> 04:36:23.500 region:rollup2
I THINK MAYBE IT'S WORTH.

04:36:21.565 --> 04:36:24.101 region:rollup2
AT LEAST MORE THAN A COUPLE DAYS

04:36:23.500 --> 04:36:24.601 region:rollup2
TO FIGURE OUT IF THAT'S A GOOD

04:36:24.101 --> 04:36:26.970 region:rollup2
IDEA OR NOT [inaudible]

04:36:24.601 --> 04:36:28.639 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

04:36:26.970 --> 04:36:30.040 region:rollup2
NOW THERE MAY THERE ARE FLAWS IN

04:36:28.639 --> 04:36:31.642 region:rollup2
THE BILL SYSTEM BUT ONE THING IT

04:36:30.040 --> 04:36:33.844 region:rollup2
DOESN'T SURE IS IT IT CREATES A

04:36:31.642 --> 04:36:35.212 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL INCENTIVE. FOR SOMEONE

04:36:33.844 --> 04:36:37.681 region:rollup2
TO ENSURE THAT SOMEONE SHOWS

04:36:35.212 --> 04:36:39.083 region:rollup2
BACK UP TO COURT.

04:36:37.681 --> 04:36:41.051 region:rollup2
WHICH IS KIND OF AN IMPORTANT

04:36:39.083 --> 04:36:42.753 region:rollup2
THING TO DO TO ENSURE RIGHT.

04:36:41.051 --> 04:36:44.755 region:rollup2
IT ALSO WERE ALSO TALKING ABOUT

04:36:42.753 --> 04:36:45.556 region:rollup2
A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT THAT'S

04:36:44.755 --> 04:36:47.691 region:rollup2
BEEN BROUGHT UP AS WELL THE

04:36:45.556 --> 04:36:49.426 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION.

04:36:47.691 --> 04:36:51.628 region:rollup2
AS PROVISIONS OF THE PROTECT

04:36:49.426 --> 04:36:52.663 region:rollup2
YOUR RIGHT TO BAIL.

04:36:51.628 --> 04:36:55.365 region:rollup2
IN THAT ONLY UNDER VERY NARROW

04:36:52.663 --> 04:36:57.334 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCES CAN YOU BE DENIED.

04:36:55.365 --> 04:36:58.469 region:rollup2
CAN YOU BE DENIED THAT RIGHT NOW

04:36:57.334 --> 04:37:00.237 region:rollup2
WE'RE CREATING A SYSTEM THAT HAS

04:36:58.469 --> 04:37:01.939 region:rollup2
A WHOLE LOT OF EXEMPTIONS. TO

04:37:00.237 --> 04:37:03.474 region:rollup2
THAT IT MAY VERY WELL BE

04:37:01.939 --> 04:37:05.275 region:rollup2
UNCONSTITUTIONAL BUT WHY TAKE

I ALSO WANT TO JUST BE CLEAR.

04:38:42.706 --> 04:38:47.110 region:rollup2
THE LA COUNTY DISTRICT

ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IS NOT THE END

04:38:47.110 --> 04:38:50.047 region:rollup2

NOT LET IT GO BECAUSE THIS IS

04:39:15.138 --> 04:39:21.445 region:rollup2
NOT THE SILVER BULLET.

04:39:18.609 --> 04:39:25.182 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE NO BILL WE PASSED.

04:39:21.445 --> 04:39:26.583 region:rollup2
IS A SILVER BULLET.

04:39:25.182 --> 04:39:31.121 region:rollup2
SO MAYBE SOME DAYS WE SHOULD BE

04:39:26.583 --> 04:39:34.591 region:rollup2
LOOKING FOR BRONZE OR COPPER.

04:39:31.121 --> 04:39:36.860 region:rollup2
OR EVEN SOME WOULD [inaudible]

04:39:34.591 --> 04:39:39.930 region:rollup2
PROBATION.

04:39:36.860 --> 04:39:43.667 region:rollup2
DA'S OFFICE SAYS JUDGES.

04:39:39.930 --> 04:39:46.103 region:rollup2
IMPLICIT BIAS IN THOSE SYSTEMS.

04:39:43.667 --> 04:39:48.672 region:rollup2
LET'S BE CLEAR.

04:39:46.103 --> 04:39:52.009 region:rollup2
RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS PREVENTIVE

04:39:48.672 --> 04:39:55.312 region:rollup2

KEY TRACKING IS KEY.

04:40:00.784 --> 04:40:06.456 region:rollup2
BUT OUR OWNING THIS ISSUE ITS

04:40:03.620 --> 04:40:08.125 region:rollup2
PROCESS AND ITS SUCCESS IS ALSO

04:40:06.456 --> 04:40:10.627 region:rollup2
KEY.

04:40:08.125 --> 04:40:11.361 region:rollup2
AND WE DECIDED TO DO IT.

04:40:10.627 --> 04:40:17.034 region:rollup2

CASH RULES EVERYTHING AROUND US.

04:40:23.940 --> 04:40:26.109 region:rollup2
THE BAIL SYSTEM.

04:40:25.676 --> 04:40:31.615 region:rollup2
OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM

04:40:26.109 --> 04:40:34.685 region:rollup2
OUR-PROBATION SYSTEM.

04:40:31.615 --> 04:40:38.055 region:rollup2
THOSE ALL GENERATE REVENUE

04:40:34.685 --> 04:40:39.156 region:rollup2
BECAUSE SPOKES GO BEFORE PEOPLE.

04:40:38.055 --> 04:40:42.526 region:rollup2
LOOKING FOR FREEDOM OR DUE

04:40:39.156 --> 04:40:45.662 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

04:40:42.526 --> 04:40:45.962 region:rollup2
BUT STRAPPING PEOPLE'S LIBERTY

04:40:45.962 --> 04:40:53.203 region:rollup2
AND FUTURE. TO BAIL MONEY.

04:40:49.199 --> 04:40:54.538 region:rollup2
IS JUST WRONG.

04:40:53.203 --> 04:40:56.707 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE MAJORITY OF

04:40:54.538 --> 04:40:58.642 region:rollup2

04:40:56.707 --> 04:41:01.278 region:rollup2
LOOK LIKE SO MANY FOLKS WHO ARE

FIX THE SYSTEMS THAT ARE BROKEN.

04:41:22.232 --> 04:41:26.436 region:rollup2

04:41:29.573 --> 04:41:35.879 region:rollup2
AND FAILURE ONLY COMES.

04:41:32.342 --> 04:41:38.215 region:rollup2
WHEN WE DO NOTHING?

04:41:35.879 --> 04:41:40.016 region:rollup2
AND IF I TELL MY LITTLE PEOPLE.

04:41:38.215 --> 04:41:41.651 region:rollup2

RACIAL DISPARITIES IN BAIL.

04:46:14.190 --> 04:46:19.162 region:rollup2

AMERICAN MEN IT'S 35% HIGHER.

04:46:22.065 --> 04:46:24.934 region:rollup2
THAT OF THEIR WHITE

IMPRISONED.

04:46:53.963 --> 04:46:56.633 region:rollup2
SOLELY BASED ON POVERTY

04:46:56.332 --> 04:46:58.601 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

04:46:56.633 --> 04:47:00.804 region:rollup2
SECOND EXAMPLE.

04:46:58.601 --> 04:47:02.806 region:rollup2
A GUNMAN AND TO HIM A COUNTY

04:47:00.804 --> 04:47:04.774 region:rollup2
NAMED KEVIN MEAL.

04:47:02.806 --> 04:47:06.509 region:rollup2
WHEN OUT ON BAIL?

04:47:04.774 --> 04:47:07.577 region:rollup2
AFTER STABBING A NEIGHBOR AFTER

04:47:06.509 --> 04:47:09.612 region:rollup2
KILLING FIVE PEOPLE INCLUDING

04:47:07.577 --> 04:47:10.080 region:rollup2
HIS WIFE.

04:47:09.612 --> 04:47:12.015 region:rollup2
HE WAS A DANGER TO HIS

04:47:10.080 --> 04:47:13.416 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY.

04:47:12.015 --> 04:47:16.853 region:rollup2
AND HE WAS RELEASED SIMPLY

04:47:13.416 --> 04:47:17.720 region:rollup2
BECAUSE HE MADE BAIL.

04:47:16.853 --> 04:47:20.023 region:rollup2
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

04:47:17.720 --> 04:47:21.357 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION ABOUT SAFETY AND

04:47:20.023 --> 04:47:23.193 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY AND WHAT THAT ALL

04:47:21.357 --> 04:47:24.627 region:rollup2
MEANS.

04:47:23.193 --> 04:47:26.596 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE TWO REAL WORLD

04:47:24.627 --> 04:47:28.865 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES.

04:47:26.596 --> 04:47:30.734 region:rollup2
OF HOW THIS ACTUALLY WORKS.

04:47:28.865 --> 04:47:32.769 region:rollup2
CASH BAIL IS ABOUT WHETHER YOU

04:47:30.734 --> 04:47:34.637 region:rollup2
CAN AFFORD IT OR NOT.

04:47:32.769 --> 04:47:34.938 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE TODAY

04:47:34.637 --> 04:47:36.639 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

04:47:34.938 --> 04:47:38.675 region:rollup2
IS DIFFERENT.

04:47:36.639 --> 04:47:40.610 region:rollup2
WE ARE ENSURING.

04:47:38.675 --> 04:47:40.910 region:rollup2
THAT OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM

04:47:40.610 --> 04:47:42.412 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

04:47:40.910 --> 04:47:44.013 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY WORKS.

04:47:42.412 --> 04:47:46.182 region:rollup2
IN THAT YOU ARE INNOCENT UNTIL

04:47:44.013 --> 04:47:48.218 region:rollup2
PROVEN GUILTY.

04:47:46.182 --> 04:47:50.120 region:rollup2
THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT ROTTING AWAY

04:47:48.218 --> 04:47:52.021 region:rollup2
IN JAIL.

04:47:50.120 --> 04:47:55.158 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY ARE POOR.

04:47:52.021 --> 04:47:57.393 region:rollup2
AND THEY CAN'T AFFORD CASH BAIL.

04:47:55.158 --> 04:47:59.329 region:rollup2
THAT WORKING CLASS PEOPLE WHO

04:47:57.393 --> 04:48:00.330 region:rollup2
ARE MAKING AN HONEST LIVING

04:47:59.329 --> 04:48:02.165 region:rollup2
PERHAPS WORKING TWO TO THREE

04:48:00.330 --> 04:48:04.167 region:rollup2
JOBS.

04:48:02.165 --> 04:48:06.035 region:rollup2
TRYING TO MAKE ENDS MEET.

04:48:04.167 --> 04:48:07.904 region:rollup2
AND WHO UNFORTUNATELY GET UP GET

04:48:06.035 --> 04:48:09.572 region:rollup2
CAUGHT UP IN THE SYSTEM.

04:48:07.904 --> 04:48:11.141 region:rollup2
HAVE AN EQUAL AND FAIR SYSTEM

04:48:09.572 --> 04:48:13.176 region:rollup2
THAT REPRESENTS THEM BASED ON

04:48:11.141 --> 04:48:15.345 region:rollup2
JUSTICE.

04:48:13.176 --> 04:48:16.713 region:rollup2
NOT ON THE PREMISE.

04:48:15.345 --> 04:48:19.816 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY CAN AFFORD TO MAKE

04:48:16.713 --> 04:48:20.350 region:rollup2
CASH BAIL?

04:48:19.816 --> 04:48:21.518 region:rollup2
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK

04:48:20.350 --> 04:48:22.886 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

04:48:21.518 --> 04:48:23.386 region:rollup2
HOW THIS BILL IS IN?

04:48:22.886 --> 04:48:25.488 region:rollup2
AND KNOW NOTHING IS EVER

04:48:23.386 --> 04:48:27.690 region:rollup2
PERFECT.

04:48:25.488 --> 04:48:28.124 region:rollup2
THERE IS THE REAL WORLD IN WHICH

04:48:27.690 --> 04:48:30.560 region:rollup2
ME LIVIN IN WHICH WE

04:48:28.124 --> 04:48:32.796 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE.

04:48:30.560 --> 04:48:34.264 region:rollup2
AND THEN THERE'S THE IDEAL WORLD

04:48:32.796 --> 04:48:36.499 region:rollup2
IN WHICH WE ALL HOPED WE LIVED

04:48:34.264 --> 04:48:38.301 region:rollup2
AND HOPEFULLY STEP BY STEP.

04:48:36.499 --> 04:48:39.903 region:rollup2
WE GET THERE.

04:48:38.301 --> 04:48:41.171 region:rollup2
BUT IT TAKES TIME IT TAKES

04:48:39.903 --> 04:48:43.306 region:rollup2
COURAGE AND I'M SO.

04:48:41.171 --> 04:48:45.675 region:rollup2
I'M SO AND I FEEL REALLY GOOD

04:48:43.306 --> 04:48:46.910 region:rollup2
ABOUT SO MANY REPUBLICAN MEMBERS

04:48:45.675 --> 04:48:48.444 region:rollup2
SAYING THAT THEY WANT TO WORK ON

04:48:46.910 --> 04:48:50.079 region:rollup2
THIS IN THE FUTURE.

04:48:48.444 --> 04:48:51.047 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IF THIS MAKES IT OUT

04:48:50.079 --> 04:48:53.216 region:rollup2
INTO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK AND GET

04:48:51.047 --> 04:48:54.617 region:rollup2
FINE INTO LAW I'M REALLY LOOKING

04:48:53.216 --> 04:48:55.685 region:rollup2
FORWARD TO PUT TOGETHER A

04:48:54.617 --> 04:48:57.353 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE WITH.

04:48:55.685 --> 04:48:58.955 region:rollup2
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS ON HOW

04:48:57.353 --> 04:49:00.123 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO FIX THE SYSTEM.

04:48:58.955 --> 04:49:02.025 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT'S IMPRESSIVE AN

04:49:00.123 --> 04:49:02.625 region:rollup2
INSPIRATIONAL IN THE

04:49:02.025 --> 04:49:04.460 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION THAT HAS HAPPENED

04:49:02.625 --> 04:49:05.762 region:rollup2
TODAY.

04:49:04.460 --> 04:49:07.897 region:rollup2
SO LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

04:49:05.762 --> 04:49:09.332 region:rollup2
HOPE IN WHAT THAT MEANS BECAUSE

04:49:07.897 --> 04:49:11.501 region:rollup2
YOU CANNOT PUT.

04:49:09.332 --> 04:49:13.236 region:rollup2
PRICE ON FREEDOM.

04:49:11.501 --> 04:49:15.238 region:rollup2
WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY IN THE

04:49:13.236 --> 04:49:17.207 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO PIVOT.

04:49:15.238 --> 04:49:19.108 region:rollup2
I CHANGE THE COURSE OF THE STATE

04:49:17.207 --> 04:49:21.211 region:rollup2
TO BE A BEACON OF HOPE. FOR THE

04:49:19.108 --> 04:49:22.879 region:rollup2
REST OF THE NATION.

04:49:21.211 --> 04:49:25.682 region:rollup2
THEN NONE OF THIS IS EASY IT

04:49:22.879 --> 04:49:27.350 region:rollup2
TAKES COURAGE AS IT WAS STATED.

04:49:25.682 --> 04:49:29.185 region:rollup2
BY MEMBERS BEFORE ME THAT SPOKE.

04:49:27.350 --> 04:49:30.453 region:rollup2
WE CAME HERE.

04:49:29.185 --> 04:49:32.355 region:rollup2
NOT BECAUSE THIS IS A TOUGH IS

04:49:30.453 --> 04:49:33.957 region:rollup2
EASY OR BECAUSE CASTING VOTES

04:49:32.355 --> 04:49:35.024 region:rollup2
LIKE THIS IS EASY.

04:49:33.957 --> 04:49:36.826 region:rollup2
BUT BECAUSE IT AND IT IS IN FACT

04:49:35.024 --> 04:49:38.561 region:rollup2
QUITE HARD.

04:49:36.826 --> 04:49:40.096 region:rollup2
IT IS CHALLENGING.

04:49:38.561 --> 04:49:41.698 region:rollup2
AND IT TAKES COURAGE WHETHER

04:49:40.096 --> 04:49:43.466 region:rollup2
IT'S LITTLE BY LITTLE STEP BY

04:49:41.698 --> 04:49:45.635 region:rollup2
STEP TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

04:49:43.466 --> 04:49:47.103 region:rollup2
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY.

04:49:45.635 --> 04:49:49.105 region:rollup2
REPRESENT THE PEOPLE OF THE

04:49:47.103 --> 04:49:52.709 region:rollup2
STATE WHO DESERVE JUSTICE.

04:49:49.105 --> 04:49:53.877 region:rollup2
WHO DESERVE TO BE ABLE?

04:49:52.709 --> 04:49:55.979 region:rollup2
TO NOT ROT IN PRISON BECAUSE

04:49:53.877 --> 04:49:57.347 region:rollup2
THEY ARE POOR.

04:49:55.979 --> 04:49:59.015 region:rollup2
WE TALK ABOUT POVERTY THE TALK

04:49:57.347 --> 04:50:00.550 region:rollup2
ABOUT JOBS.

04:49:59.015 --> 04:50:02.352 region:rollup2
WE TALK ABOUT WHAT HELPING THE

04:50:00.550 --> 04:50:04.087 region:rollup2
WORKING WORKING CLASS WORKING

04:50:02.352 --> 04:50:04.988 region:rollup2
FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE.

04:50:04.087 --> 04:50:06.756 region:rollup2
HERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO

04:50:04.988 --> 04:50:08.258 region:rollup2
DO THAT.

04:50:06.756 --> 04:50:10.326 region:rollup2
HERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO

04:50:08.258 --> 04:50:10.860 region:rollup2
CHANGE THE COURSE OF OUR STATE

04:50:10.326 --> 04:50:12.295 region:rollup2
CHANGE THE COURSE OF THIS

04:50:10.860 --> 04:50:14.697 region:rollup2
NATION.

04:50:12.295 --> 04:50:17.200 region:rollup2
AND WHILE THIS BILL S. B. TAME

04:50:14.697 --> 04:50:18.568 region:rollup2
MEN MAY NOT BE PERFECT.

04:50:17.200 --> 04:50:20.436 region:rollup2
IT IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT

HEARD THIS IN COMMITTEE

HEARD IT ON THE FLOOR.

04:51:45.521 --> 04:51:48.157 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT A NEW CONCEPT THIS

04:51:46.956 --> 04:51:49.692 region:rollup2
IS NOT SOMETHING WE SUDDENLY

04:51:48.157 --> 04:51:51.594 region:rollup2
CAME UP WITH AND I REMEMBER

04:51:49.692 --> 04:51:54.097 region:rollup2
STANDING UP ON THE FLOOR LAST

04:51:51.594 --> 04:51:55.732 region:rollup2
YEAR. FOR THE ASSEMBLY BILL THAT

04:51:54.097 --> 04:51:57.400 region:rollup2
MY COLLEAGUE FROM OAKLAND

04:51:55.732 --> 04:51:59.535 region:rollup2
BROUGHT IN HEARING PEOPLE SAY

04:51:57.400 --> 04:52:00.903 region:rollup2
WELL WHY ARE WE RUSHING AT CAN'T

04:51:59.535 --> 04:52:01.604 region:rollup2
WE JUST WAIT FOR THE CHIEF

04:52:00.903 --> 04:52:03.339 region:rollup2
JUSTICE TO PUT OUT HER

04:52:01.604 --> 04:52:05.775 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION.

04:52:03.339 --> 04:52:08.578 region:rollup2
WELL SHE DID THAT.

04:52:05.775 --> 04:52:09.112 region:rollup2
AND THEY WERE LISTEN.

04:52:08.578 --> 04:52:10.046 region:rollup2
TO AND THEY WERE USED TO

04:52:09.112 --> 04:52:11.214 region:rollup2
COLLABORATE.

04:52:10.046 --> 04:52:12.648 region:rollup2
AND I HEARD PEOPLE STAND UP SOME

04:52:11.214 --> 04:52:14.484 region:rollup2
THE SAME PEOPLE WHO ARE STANDING

04:52:12.648 --> 04:52:15.885 region:rollup2
UP TODAY OPPOSING THOSE SAYING

04:52:14.484 --> 04:52:17.286 region:rollup2
THEY KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG

04:52:15.885 --> 04:52:18.521 region:rollup2
BUT THIS WASN'T THE FIX AND

04:52:17.286 --> 04:52:20.022 region:rollup2
WE'VE HEARD NOTHING FROM THEM.

04:52:18.521 --> 04:52:22.892 region:rollup2
THIS PAST YEAR IN LOOKING FOR

04:52:20.022 --> 04:52:24.260 region:rollup2
AFFECTS.

04:52:22.892 --> 04:52:26.462 region:rollup2
AND YET STILL IN COMMUNITIES

04:52:24.260 --> 04:52:27.964 region:rollup2
LIKE MINE.

04:52:26.462 --> 04:52:29.766 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE PICKED UP FOR THINGS

04:52:27.964 --> 04:52:30.967 region:rollup2
THAT THEY DIDN'T DO.

04:52:29.766 --> 04:52:32.602 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE TO POST A BILL IN

04:52:30.967 --> 04:52:34.537 region:rollup2
ORDER TO GO TO WORK.

04:52:32.602 --> 04:52:35.405 region:rollup2
AND THAT MONEY IS KEPT FROM THEM

04:52:34.537 --> 04:52:37.807 region:rollup2
EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NEVER

04:52:35.405 --> 04:52:39.442 region:rollup2
CHARGED.

04:52:37.807 --> 04:52:41.844 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO ARE FOUND INNOCENT

04:52:39.442 --> 04:52:44.213 region:rollup2
WHO SHOW UP TO COURT.

04:52:41.844 --> 04:52:46.682 region:rollup2
THEY LOSE THAT 10%.

04:52:44.213 --> 04:52:48.384 region:rollup2
IN A COMMUNITY LIKE MINE.

04:52:46.682 --> 04:52:49.485 region:rollup2
WHERE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS OR

04:52:48.384 --> 04:52:51.387 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLARS ARE A FEW

04:52:49.485 --> 04:52:54.724 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLARS COULD BE YOUR

04:52:51.387 --> 04:52:57.293 region:rollup2
FAMILY'S ENTIRE SAVINGS?

04:52:54.724 --> 04:52:58.861 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT THE CASH BAIL

04:52:57.293 --> 04:53:00.096 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IS BROKEN.

04:52:58.861 --> 04:53:01.864 region:rollup2
AND I'LL SAY WHAT I SAID LAST

04:53:00.096 --> 04:53:05.768 region:rollup2
YEAR A THEFT ON POOR PEOPLE.

04:53:01.864 --> 04:53:06.836 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT. TO SUGGEST SOMEHOW

04:53:05.768 --> 04:53:08.671 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE PUTTING OURSELVES IN

04:53:06.836 --> 04:53:10.239 region:rollup2
MORE DANGER.

04:53:08.671 --> 04:53:12.141 region:rollup2
IS INCREDIBLE TO ME AND I KEEP

04:53:10.239 --> 04:53:13.609 region:rollup2
HEARING THIS AS IF PEOPLE WHO

04:53:12.141 --> 04:53:15.945 region:rollup2
CAN AFFORD PAY ALL.

04:53:13.609 --> 04:53:17.013 region:rollup2
RICH PEOPLE WHO ARE LET OUT.

04:53:15.945 --> 04:53:19.282 region:rollup2
I THINK LAST YEAR THERE WAS A

04:53:17.013 --> 04:53:23.419 region:rollup2
POST OF A BILL FOR THIRTY SIX

04:53:19.282 --> 04:53:25.154 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS. TO SUGGEST THAT

04:53:23.419 --> 04:53:28.925 region:rollup2
THAT WOMAN IS ANY [inaudible]

04:53:25.154 --> 04:53:30.860 region:rollup2
LESS LIKELY. TO RE OFFEND.

04:53:28.925 --> 04:53:33.095 region:rollup2
BECAUSE SHE HAS MONEY.

04:53:30.860 --> 04:53:35.264 region:rollup2
OR TO SUGGEST THAT.

04:53:33.095 --> 04:53:36.999 region:rollup2
THE THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF

04:53:35.264 --> 04:53:38.768 region:rollup2
SEX OFFENDERS [inaudible]

04:53:36.999 --> 04:53:40.703 region:rollup2
RAPIST [inaudible]

04:53:38.768 --> 04:53:42.138 region:rollup2
MURDERERS.

04:53:40.703 --> 04:53:44.974 region:rollup2
WHO ARE LED OUT BECAUSE THEY

04:53:42.138 --> 04:53:46.709 region:rollup2
SIMPLY HAVE MONEY?

04:53:44.974 --> 04:53:49.745 region:rollup2
SOMEHOW MAKE US SAFER BY KEEPING

04:53:46.709 --> 04:53:51.714 region:rollup2
THAT SYSTEM.

04:53:49.745 --> 04:53:53.783 region:rollup2
IT'S CLEAR THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE

04:53:51.714 --> 04:53:54.884 region:rollup2
MISTAKES IN THE SYSTEM.

04:53:53.783 --> 04:53:56.185 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE

04:53:54.884 --> 04:53:57.487 region:rollup2
THERE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE CAN

04:53:56.185 --> 04:54:00.289 region:rollup2
GET THE EXACT NUMBER WHO ARE LET

04:53:57.487 --> 04:54:01.224 region:rollup2
OUT ON BAIL NOW. FOR LET OUT

04:54:00.289 --> 04:54:03.926 region:rollup2
AFTER PAIN THEIR BAIL WHO RE

04:54:01.224 --> 04:54:05.528 region:rollup2
OFFEND.

04:54:03.926 --> 04:54:07.063 region:rollup2
THERE WILL BE SOME PEOPLE.

04:54:05.528 --> 04:54:08.731 region:rollup2
WHO ARE LET OUT UNDER THIS RISK

04:54:07.063 --> 04:54:14.437 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT STUDY?

04:54:08.731 --> 04:54:16.038 region:rollup2
WHO OUR SITUATION WHO WILL FUND?

04:54:14.437 --> 04:54:17.573 region:rollup2
BUT WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING TO

04:54:16.038 --> 04:54:18.708 region:rollup2
CORRECT A SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE

04:54:17.573 --> 04:54:20.409 region:rollup2
ALL SAID NOW ON THIS FLOOR IS

04:54:18.708 --> 04:54:22.478 region:rollup2
BROKEN.

04:54:20.409 --> 04:54:23.746 region:rollup2
AND TO MY FRIENDS.

04:54:22.478 --> 04:54:25.248 region:rollup2
ON THE PROGRESSIVE SIDE AT THE

04:54:23.746 --> 04:54:26.315 region:rollup2
ACLU.

04:54:25.248 --> 04:54:27.917 region:rollup2
AND ARE ACTIVISTS IN THE

04:54:26.315 --> 04:54:28.985 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY WHO SAY THIS DOESN'T

04:54:27.917 --> 04:54:33.156 region:rollup2
GO FAR ENOUGH.

04:54:28.985 --> 04:54:35.758 region:rollup2
I WOULD JUST SAY THIS.

04:54:33.156 --> 04:54:36.526 region:rollup2
I AGREE AND I AGREE BOMB.

04:54:35.758 --> 04:54:37.627 region:rollup2
WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS

04:54:36.526 --> 04:54:39.795 region:rollup2
ANGELES WHO SAID WE HAVE A

04:54:37.627 --> 04:54:40.963 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY TO CONTINUE TO

04:54:39.795 --> 04:54:43.533 region:rollup2
WRAP HER ARMS AROUND THIS AND

04:54:40.963 --> 04:54:45.101 region:rollup2
MAKE IT BETTER.

04:54:43.533 --> 04:54:47.236 region:rollup2
BUT HAVING STEP THROUGH THIS

04:54:45.101 --> 04:54:49.438 region:rollup2
OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS.

04:54:47.236 --> 04:54:50.840 region:rollup2
IF WE DON'T PASS THIS NOW.

04:54:49.438 --> 04:54:53.242 region:rollup2
THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE A BILL

04:54:50.840 --> 04:54:56.679 region:rollup2
TO BE BROUGHT BACK NEXT YEAR.

04:54:53.242 --> 04:54:58.481 region:rollup2
OR THE YEAR AFTER THAT.

04:54:56.679 --> 04:55:00.283 region:rollup2
THERE JUST ISN'T SIMPLY.

04:54:58.481 --> 04:55:01.751 region:rollup2
THE WILL TO START FROM SCRATCH

04:55:00.283 --> 04:55:03.152 region:rollup2
BECAUSE ALTHOUGH EVERYBODY WILL

04:55:01.751 --> 04:55:05.488 region:rollup2
SIT HERE TODAY AND SAY THIS IS

04:55:03.152 --> 04:55:06.956 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WE SHOULD WORK ON 90%

04:55:05.488 --> 04:55:09.025 region:rollup2
OF THE PEOPLE STANDING UP AND

04:55:06.956 --> 04:55:11.227 region:rollup2
SAYING THAT HAVE DONE NOTHING.

04:55:09.025 --> 04:55:13.229 region:rollup2
TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE.

04:55:11.227 --> 04:55:15.398 region:rollup2
OR TO MAKE THIS ISSUE BETTER.

04:55:13.229 --> 04:55:16.632 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE TRUTH.

04:55:15.398 --> 04:55:19.268 region:rollup2
BECAUSE MOST OF US AREN'T

04:55:16.632 --> 04:55:20.970 region:rollup2
AFFECTED DIRECTLY BY THE US.

04:55:19.268 --> 04:55:22.171 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE

04:55:20.970 --> 04:55:22.471 region:rollup2
DIRECTED DIRECTLY OFFENDED

04:55:22.171 --> 04:55:24.674 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

04:55:22.471 --> 04:55:26.242 region:rollup2
I'VE S..

04:55:24.674 --> 04:55:27.210 region:rollup2
SO THOSE OF US WHO CARE DEEPLY

04:55:26.242 --> 04:55:28.678 region:rollup2
BUT CARE DEEPLY WHAT ARE

04:55:27.210 --> 04:55:30.046 region:rollup2
ACTIVISTS THINK AS MUCH AS

04:55:28.678 --> 04:55:32.381 region:rollup2
KEEPING OUR COMMUNITY SAFE.

04:55:30.046 --> 04:55:34.517 region:rollup2
NO THIS IS A GOOD FIRST STEP.

04:55:32.381 --> 04:55:36.819 region:rollup2
IT'S A SOLID FIRST STEP. TO GET

04:55:34.517 --> 04:55:38.321 region:rollup2
US TO A POSITION WHERE WE CAN

04:55:36.819 --> 04:55:39.956 region:rollup2
WRAP OUR ARMS AROUND IT.

04:55:38.321 --> 04:55:42.358 region:rollup2
WHERE WE CONTINUE TO CONTINUE TO

04:55:39.956 --> 04:55:44.527 region:rollup2
WORK?

04:55:42.358 --> 04:55:45.995 region:rollup2
TOWARDS AS MY FORMER SEAT MAKING

04:55:44.527 --> 04:55:47.129 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO SAID

04:55:45.995 --> 04:55:47.997 region:rollup2
AND I I DON'T THINK ANYONE COULD

04:55:47.129 --> 04:55:51.467 region:rollup2
SAY IT BETTER.

04:55:47.997 --> 04:55:52.535 region:rollup2
TOWARDS JUSTICE.

04:55:51.467 --> 04:55:55.271 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT WE ALL HAVE A

04:55:52.535 --> 04:55:57.673 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY TO DO.

04:55:55.271 --> 04:55:59.809 region:rollup2
THIS IS BEEN A LONG TWO YEARS WE

04:55:57.673 --> 04:56:02.979 region:rollup2
HAVE DEBATED THIS IN COMMITTEE

04:55:59.809 --> 04:56:04.947 region:rollup2
AFTER COMMITTEE AFTER COMMITTEE.

04:56:02.979 --> 04:56:06.716 region:rollup2
WE'VE DEBATED ON THE FLOOR IT'S

04:56:04.947 --> 04:56:08.084 region:rollup2
BEEN DEBATED IN THE SENATE IT'S

04:56:06.716 --> 04:56:09.619 region:rollup2
BEEN DEBATED IN THE MEDIA IT'S

04:56:08.084 --> 04:56:10.119 region:rollup2
BEEN DEBATED BY THE JUDICIAL

04:56:09.619 --> 04:56:12.788 region:rollup2
COUNCIL AND BY OUR CHIEF

04:56:10.119 --> 04:56:14.790 region:rollup2
JUSTICE.

04:56:12.788 --> 04:56:16.559 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT NEW TO ANYBODY OR

04:56:14.790 --> 04:56:17.627 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T BE NUDE ANYBODY HERE.

04:56:16.559 --> 04:56:20.730 region:rollup2
I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT WE VOTE

04:56:17.627 --> 04:56:22.999 region:rollup2

THIS BILL DOES NOT COMPLETE DOES

05:04:18.307 --> 05:04:21.710 region:rollup2

IN THAT DIRECTION.

05:04:26.081 --> 05:04:30.652 region:rollup2
BY ELIMINATING CASH BAIL WE ARE

05:04:28.550 --> 05:04:33.055 region:rollup2

ABILITY TO PAY SHOULD NOT BE

05:04:33.055 --> 05:04:37.092 region:rollup2

WOMAN OR ANY MAN.

05:04:41.063 --> 05:04:45.234 region:rollup2
AND ACCESS TO CASH.

05:04:42.998 --> 05:04:46.869 region:rollup2

05:07:37.673 --> 05:07:43.312 region:rollup2
THE COST WAS MENTIONED.

05:07:40.075 --> 05:07:44.947 region:rollup2
IT IS NOT INEXPENSIVE. TO CREATE

05:07:43.312 --> 05:07:46.548 region:rollup2
A FAIRER MORE JUST SYSTEM THAT

05:07:44.947 --> 05:07:47.115 region:rollup2

FRONT END.

05:07:48.884 --> 05:07:51.353 region:rollup2
WE HAVE LEARNED FROM SOME OF THE

05:07:49.518 --> 05:07:52.754 region:rollup2
BEST COUNTIES THAT HAVE DONE

05:07:51.353 --> 05:07:53.322 region:rollup2
THIS THAT IF MEN AT THIS WE

05:07:52.754 --> 05:07:55.057 region:rollup2

05:07:53.322 --> 05:07:57.092 region:rollup2
PILOTS.

05:07:55.057 --> 05:07:57.693 region:rollup2
WE'VE HAD SANTA CLARA DOING THIS

05:07:57.092 --> 05:07:59.528 region:rollup2
WE'VE HAD SAN FRANCISCO DOING

05:07:57.693 --> 05:08:00.128 region:rollup2
THIS WE'VE HAD SANTA CRUZ DOING

05:07:59.528 --> 05:08:01.330 region:rollup2

05:08:03.966 --> 05:08:07.969 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS NOT TIME FTA TO TO

05:08:05.701 --> 05:08:09.338 region:rollup2
FOR A PILOT.

05:08:07.969 --> 05:08:10.939 region:rollup2

05:08:24.820 --> 05:08:27.022 region:rollup2

05:08:43.071 --> 05:08:46.141 region:rollup2
IT HAS APPROPRIATE TENSED

05:08:44.072 --> 05:08:48.744 region:rollup2
DETENTIONS.

05:08:46.141 --> 05:08:49.878 region:rollup2
IT REDUCES AND SIX TO ELIMINATE.

05:08:48.744 --> 05:08:53.448 region:rollup2
INAPPROPRIATE DETENTIONS WHICH

05:08:49.878 --> 05:08:54.549 region:rollup2
IS THE HALLMARK OF THE CURRENT.

05:08:53.448 --> 05:08:57.052 region:rollup2
ATTENTIONS BASED ON MONEY.

05:08:54.549 --> 05:08:58.620 region:rollup2

05:09:08.063 --> 05:09:12.234 region:rollup2
UNDER THE SPELL.

05:09:11.166 --> 05:09:14.469 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THE COMMENTS THAT I'VE

05:09:12.234 --> 05:09:18.206 region:rollup2

QUO.

05:09:22.177 --> 05:09:25.180 region:rollup2
BUT JUST BECAUSE IT'S BEEN THAT

05:09:23.011 --> 05:09:26.815 region:rollup2
WAY.

05:09:25.180 --> 05:09:27.382 region:rollup2
EVEN FOR A LONG TIME DOESN'T

05:09:26.815 --> 05:09:29.184 region:rollup2
MEAN HOUSE TO CONTINUE TO BE

05:09:27.382 --> 05:09:30.919 region:rollup2
THAT WAY.

05:09:29.184 --> 05:09:32.954 region:rollup2

PARALYZED BY THE FEAR CHANGE

05:09:46.101 --> 05:09:49.871 region:rollup2
HEARD SO MY COLLEAGUES SAY THAT

05:09:47.369 --> 05:09:51.840 region:rollup2

I KNEW THAT SHE WAS ILL.

SHE BEGAN SINGING JUST AS A

05:33:50.043 --> 05:33:54.214 region:rollup2
CHILD SHE WAS BORN IN NINETEEN

05:33:52.246 --> 05:33:55.949 region:rollup2

SHE SANG WITH THE FAMOUS MAHALIA

05:33:59.920 --> 05:34:03.323 region:rollup2

05:34:02.356 --> 05:34:04.758 region:rollup2
SHE TAUGHT HERSELF HOW TO PLAY

THE PIANO.

05:34:04.758 --> 05:34:07.561 region:rollup2
AND THEN SHE LEARNED TO READ

05:34:05.893 --> 05:34:09.396 region:rollup2
SHEET MUSIC AND BEGAN TO COMPOSE

05:34:07.561 --> 05:34:12.099 region:rollup2
SONGS ARE SELF.

05:34:09.396 --> 05:34:13.333 region:rollup2
SHE WAS TRULY A MUSICAL GENIUS.

05:34:12.099 --> 05:34:14.401 region:rollup2
SHE BEGAN SINGING AT THE AGE OF

05:34:13.333 --> 05:34:15.536 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN AND SO SHE SPENT OVER

05:34:14.401 --> 05:34:17.537 region:rollup2
SIXTY YEARS.

05:34:15.536 --> 05:34:19.706 region:rollup2
AS AN ARTIST.

05:34:17.537 --> 05:34:21.742 region:rollup2
NOT JUST SOMEONE WE KNEW ABOUT

05:34:19.706 --> 05:34:24.011 region:rollup2
SOMEONE WAS AN ACTIVE SINGER FOR

05:34:21.742 --> 05:34:26.580 region:rollup2
SIXTY YEARS WHOSE VOICE WAS JUST

05:34:24.011 --> 05:34:29.182 region:rollup2
A STRONG THE BASS HE PASSED.

05:34:26.580 --> 05:34:31.552 region:rollup2
AS WHEN SHE FIRST BEGAN TO SING.

05:34:29.182 --> 05:34:33.220 region:rollup2
SHE ALSO WASN'T NOTED FOR THE

05:34:31.552 --> 05:34:34.588 region:rollup2
FACT THAT SHE OF HIM THAT WHEN

05:34:33.220 --> 05:34:37.190 region:rollup2
SHE FOUND A SONG.

05:34:34.588 --> 05:34:37.824 region:rollup2
AND SANG THAT SONG THE ARTIST

05:34:37.190 --> 05:34:38.859 region:rollup2
PROBABLY DIDN'T WANT TO SING IT

05:34:37.824 --> 05:34:40.460 region:rollup2
AGAIN.

05:34:38.859 --> 05:34:42.129 region:rollup2
LIKE NATURAL WOMAN.

05:34:40.460 --> 05:34:43.664 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AT THAT POINT SHE OWNED

05:34:42.129 --> 05:34:45.365 region:rollup2
THAT SONG AND SHE BECAME THAT

05:34:43.664 --> 05:34:46.833 region:rollup2
PERSON.

05:34:45.365 --> 05:34:48.902 region:rollup2
AND SHE GAVE THAT SONG AS MOST

05:34:46.833 --> 05:34:50.737 region:rollup2
ARTISTS SAID NEW LIFE AND NEW

05:34:48.902 --> 05:34:52.506 region:rollup2
MEANING TO THE SONG ITSELF.

05:34:50.737 --> 05:34:54.942 region:rollup2
SHE WAS BRILLIANT.

05:34:52.506 --> 05:34:57.010 region:rollup2
IN HER MUSICAL ABILITIES.

05:34:54.942 --> 05:34:57.744 region:rollup2
MOST OF US WERE STUNNED IN TWO

05:34:57.010 --> 05:34:58.912 region:rollup2
THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN WHEN SHE

05:34:57.744 --> 05:35:00.714 region:rollup2
SANG THE OPERA [inaudible]

05:34:58.912 --> 05:35:02.516 region:rollup2
A PAPARAZZI.

05:35:00.714 --> 05:35:03.650 region:rollup2
SHE'D BEEN ONLY ASKS THAT DAY IF

05:35:02.516 --> 05:35:05.085 region:rollup2
SHE THOUGHT SHE COULD STAND IN

05:35:03.650 --> 05:35:07.254 region:rollup2
FOR HIM.

05:35:05.085 --> 05:35:08.522 region:rollup2
BECAUSE HE COULD MAKE IT.

05:35:07.254 --> 05:35:09.456 region:rollup2
AND SHE SAID WELL LET ME LISTEN

05:35:08.522 --> 05:35:11.425 region:rollup2
TO IT.

05:35:09.456 --> 05:35:13.293 region:rollup2
LET ME HEAR IT.

05:35:11.425 --> 05:35:14.761 region:rollup2
AND SHE LISTENED TO IT.

05:35:13.293 --> 05:35:16.596 region:rollup2
AND SHE SANG IT AND ALL OF US

05:35:14.761 --> 05:35:18.465 region:rollup2
WERE IN AWE.

05:35:16.596 --> 05:35:20.267 region:rollup2
OF THIS WOMAN'S ABILITY TO SING

05:35:18.465 --> 05:35:22.135 region:rollup2
ANY TYPE OF MUSIC.

05:35:20.267 --> 05:35:24.104 region:rollup2
WEATHER WAS WHAT THOSE GOSPEL

05:35:22.135 --> 05:35:26.006 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT WAS JAZZ WHAT WAS

05:35:24.104 --> 05:35:27.474 region:rollup2
BLUES WITH ROCK AND ROLL SHE

05:35:26.006 --> 05:35:28.976 region:rollup2
COULD MASTER THAT SONG AND GIVE

05:35:27.474 --> 05:35:30.110 region:rollup2
IT NEW LIFE.

05:35:28.976 --> 05:35:30.978 region:rollup2
AND SO WE WERE ALL SHOCKED WHEN

05:35:30.110 --> 05:35:32.379 region:rollup2
I SAW ON TELEVISION I WAS A

05:35:30.978 --> 05:35:33.647 region:rollup2

05:35:32.379 --> 05:35:35.015 region:rollup2
THE GRANTED AT THE GRAMMYS

05:35:33.647 --> 05:35:37.351 region:rollup2
SINGING THIS SONG THAT YOU'D

05:35:35.015 --> 05:35:39.252 region:rollup2
ONLY BEEN ASKED TO SING THAT DAY

05:35:37.351 --> 05:35:41.188 region:rollup2
THAT MANY ARTISTS WOULD TAKE A

05:35:39.252 --> 05:35:42.789 region:rollup2
LIFETIME TO LEARN TO MASTER.

05:35:41.188 --> 05:35:44.658 region:rollup2
SHE WAS AN ACTIVIST WHEN WE TALK

05:35:42.789 --> 05:35:46.159 region:rollup2
ABOUT ACTIVISTS THE DAY SOMEONE

05:35:44.658 --> 05:35:47.794 region:rollup2
ASKED ME YOU KNOW IS IT UNUSUAL

05:35:46.159 --> 05:35:49.663 region:rollup2
THAT ACTIVISTS ARE NOW STEPPING

05:35:49.663 --> 05:35:52.766 region:rollup2

AND I HAD TO REMIND THE BUT SO

05:35:52.766 --> 05:35:56.803 region:rollup2
MANY OF THE ARTISTS BEFORE THE

05:35:54.134 --> 05:35:58.839 region:rollup2
ONES WE KNOW TODAY DID THAT.

05:35:56.803 --> 05:36:00.507 region:rollup2
DISSIPATED ACTIVELY IN THE CIVIL

05:35:58.839 --> 05:36:01.642 region:rollup2

KING INTO SAYING IT ALL OF HIS

05:36:04.044 --> 05:36:08.482 region:rollup2
RALLIES BECAUSE SHE BELIEVES SO

05:36:06.913 --> 05:36:09.683 region:rollup2
STRONGLY IN WHAT HE WAS DOING.

05:36:08.482 --> 05:36:10.951 region:rollup2
AND KNEW IT WOULD MAKE A

05:36:09.683 --> 05:36:12.386 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE IN HER LIFE AND LIFE

05:36:10.951 --> 05:36:14.521 region:rollup2

05:36:12.386 --> 05:36:15.589 region:rollup2
SHE DONATED MONEY INTERESTINGLY

05:36:14.521 --> 05:36:17.290 region:rollup2
ENOUGH AND WAS WILLING TO BELLA

05:36:15.589 --> 05:36:19.059 region:rollup2

SHE IS NOTED AS A PERSON WHO WAS

KIND AND GENTLE AND INSPIRED SO

05:37:02.569 --> 05:37:05.539 region:rollup2

INSPIRE THEM TO DO GREAT THINGS.

05:37:18.151 --> 05:37:28.929 region:rollup2
RITA WAS MY FAVORITE SINGER.

05:37:20.387 --> 05:37:29.596 region:rollup2

MAKE THE RIDE A WHOLE LOT

05:37:32.599 --> 05:37:34.501 region:rollup2
SMOOTHER.

05:37:32.866 --> 05:37:37.170 region:rollup2
