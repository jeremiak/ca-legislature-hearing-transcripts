THANKS FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. LORETTA L. B. THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSES. EXACT OPPOSITE. SO ARE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU. COLLEAGUES ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS. DR PAN. THANK YOU- APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION I DID HAVE SOME QUESTIONS REGARDING- PARTICULARLY AN AREA THAT I KNOW OF REYES AND THE PREVIOUS HEARINGS AROUND CONTINUING EDUCATION THIS APPROPRIATE TIME TO DO THAT CERTAINLY CENTER FENCE YES THANK YOU- SHARE- SO I WOULD MAKE NO TO ACTUALLY WE HAVE BOTH ISSUE THIRTY TWO AN ISSUE THIRTY THREE THIRTY TWOS AUDITS C. E. PROVIDERS IN ISSUE THIRTY THREE COMPLIANCE DOCUMENTATION. BUT- SO I GUESS MY FIRST QUESTION IN RELATED. IT ALSO PROVIDESMAKE NOTE THAT THE BOARD HAS INDICATED THAT THEY'RE NOT DOING. AUDITS OF CONTINUING EDUCATION BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO NOT FULLY STAFFED- WHAT'S THE TIMELINE OR EXPECTATION OF THE BOARD WILL FULLY STAFFED THIS UNIT. WHICH OF COURSE WAS BROUGHT UP AT HER PREVIOUS- HEARING ON OVERSIGHT HEARING ON THIS BOARD. THANK YOU SENATOR AND FOR THAT QUESTION. I WOULD NOT THAT ARE EXACT OFFICER LORETTA MELBY ANSWER THAT QUESTION OKAY. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN- TO ANSWER YOUR JUST A BIT OF CLARIFICATION WE ARE AUDITING THE CONTINUING EDUCATION COURSES THAT OUR LICENSEES ARE TAKING FOR THEIR LICENSE RENEWAL. WHAT WE ARE NOT DOING IS AUDITING THE LICENSE THE CONTINUING EDUCATION PROVIDERS- THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE DID PUT FORTH IN JANUARY TWENTY NINETEEN IN JANUARY TWENTY. THAT WE WILL BE DOING THAT- AT THE PREVIOUS SUNSET HEARING AND- IN OUR PAPER WE SAID THAT WE'RE WE NEED TO STAFF THAT IT HAS BEEN VERY DIFFICULT TO STAFF THAT UNIT THROUGH PANDEMIC- I WOULD SAY THAT OUR GOAL TO FULLY STAFF THAT UNIT WOULD BE WITHIN THIS NEXT YEAR- THAT THERE ARE SOME POSITIONS THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO FILL WITHIN THAT UNIT- ONE OF THEM BEING ANY C. S. SUPERVISING NEC. SO WE ARE LOOKING AT RESTRUCTURING THAT TO CHANGE SOME OF THOSE POSITIONS SO THAT THEY ARE EASIER TO FILL OKAY THANK YOU SO WE'RE LOOKING AT HOPEFULLY NEXT YEAR. THE OTHER THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS I KNOW IF IT'S PRESCRIBED BROUGHT IT UP IN THE PAST THEY DO ASK THE SOLVE ALMOST ALL HEALTH PROFESSIONS BOARDS- SINCE YOU DO HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY OF A CONTINUING EDUCATION. DO YOU HAVE A CONFLICT THE STATE OF INTEREST STADARD FOR CONTINUING EDUCATION TO ENSURE THAT THE JUNIOR. EDUCATION NURSES ARE TAKING. OUR OUR NOT ISN'T SALES PITCHES FOR UP TO TWO PRODUCTS OTHER TYPES OF THINGS SO DO WE HAVE AS THE BOARD ESTABLISHED A CONFLICT INTERESTS STANDARD- FOR CONTINUING EDUCATION. CURRENTLY WE HAVE NOT HOWEVER WE ARE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH DCA INDICES LOOKING AT DOING THAT. AS A HUMAN BOARD STATEWIDE- OKAY OKAY WELL- I THINK I'VE BEEN BRING THIS UP FOR A WHILE AND I'VE BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE FOR WHO'S TEN YEARS SO- HI. HOPEFULLY WE CAN HAVE SOME PROGRESS ON THAT- SO THAT'S GONNA BE VERY IMPORTANT THE OTHER ISSUE IS ON C. COMPLIANCE DOCUMENTATION I ATE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT THERE MAY BE SOME CHALLENGES TO HAVE COMPLIANCE DOCUMENTS. UP LOADED- DO DO- LICENSEES AT LEAST HAVE TO CERTIFY THAT THEY- GOT DID DAVE. FORM THE THIRTY SAID- THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO- EVERY ETHNICITY EVERY TWO YEARS- AND THEN- WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE- LICENSEES WHO WHEN THEIR- DO YOU ACTUALLY AUDIT TO CONFIRM THAT- THAT THEY'VE ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH THAT SO IT CERTAINLY REALIZE YOUR ANSWER SAYS ABOUT EVERY LICENSING FOR IT THE UPLOADING COMPLIANCE INFORMATION THAT YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO DO THAT BUT- HE TALK ABOUT THE HOW WHAT PERCENTAGE OF LICENSES DO YOU ACTUALLY AUDIT. AND OF COURSE I ASSUME THAT THEY SHOULDN'T ASSUME THAT THEY HAPPILY CERTIFIED TO THE FACT THAT THEY LOOK AT LEAST TAKEN THEIR THIRTY CREDITS OF CONTAINING EDUCATION. YES I CAN ANSWER THAT FOR YOU- OUR LICENSEES FREE NEW REACH PROCESS- AND ON THE BRIEFS DOCUMENTATION BE NURSE DOES CERTIFY- THAT THEY HAVE COMPLETED THE THIRTY UNITS. ADDITIONALLY IN OUR REGULATION THAT REQUIRED TO KEEP PROOF OF THOSE FEES YOU CERTIFICATES INCOMPLETIONS FOR FOUR YEARS IN CASE WE DO AUDIT WE CAN AUDIT TWO YEAR RENEWAL CYCLE TO TWO YEAR RENEWAL ABILITY. TO UPLOAD DIRECTLY INTO GREECE THE COPIES OF THEIR CD YEARS I'M A LICENSEE WHEN I RENEWED IN MARCH OF THIS LAST YEAR WHEN I GOT TO MY SEAT YOU SECTION I ENTERED MY PROVIDER NUMBER. NAME OF THE COURSE THEY TOOK HOW MANY C. UNITS WERE IN THERE AND I UPLOADED MY CERTIFICATE TO PROVIDE PROOF OF DOCUMENTATION. AND THEN A CERTIFIED BY CLICKING THE NEXT SCREEN THAT I COMPLETED ALL THIRTY- FROM MY SEAT WAS WOULD BE A VERY EASY ONE FOR THEM TO AUDIT AS ALL THE DOCUMENTS. ARE INCREASED SO WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT I AM WORKING WITH I. T. TO MAKE THAT A HARD STOP. I AM ASKED- WATER SPECIES FOR MAKING IT HARD STOPS SO THAT OUR LICENSEES THAT HAVE TO UPLOAD THAT DOCUMENT- SO WE WOULD HAVE THAT GROUP PRIOR TO THEM MOVING ON OKAY ANYWAY- SO WE'RE WORKING ON THAT SCENARIO IS WORKING ON IT BUT IN THE PROCESS OF WORKING OUT WHAT PERCENTAGE OF. LICENSES DEAL ON IT AT THIS POINT IN TIME- TO ENSURE THAT- THAT AT LEAST YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A REASONABLE RATE OF PEOPLE COMPLYING WITH THE C. REQUIREMENTS. THE FIVE CENT OF LICENSE FEES- YEAH WHAT WHAT PERCENTAGE DO YOU AUDIT- I BELIEVE ARE PERCENTAGE- ABOUT EIGHT PER- I KEEP GETTING ACTUAL DATA FOR YOU AFTER SUN'S. AND THAT TO YOU- BUT THE ONE ABOUT I DO WANT TO DO IS THAT THIS IS AN HONEST PROFESSION AND EACH ONE OF OUR NURSES DO YOU ADD TEST THAT THEY DID DO THAT SO WE DO A- A AUDIT. AS WELL AS GETTING MAD AT A STATION FROM THEM THAT AND THEY HAVE COMPLETED PRIOR TO RENEWAL THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO RENEW IF THEY DO NOT SAY THAT THEY'VE COMPLETED THE THIRD OKAY. I APPRECIATE THAT WE'VE WE'VE SEEN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT- RANGES IN WHICH- FINDING SOME ARTISTS FROM DFFERENT HEALTH PROFESSIONALS I THINK THEY'RE ALL HONEST RIGHT. SOME. SOME SOME BOARD TO FOUND DOES. LET'S COMPLAINTS OTHERS- OTHERS ARE FOUND HIGH COMPLIANCE- THE OTHER QUESTION I ACTUALLY DO HAVE IS THAT. I UNDERSTAND THAT- WE ARE IN REQUIRES THIRTY HOURS CONTINUE EDUCATION IT'S MANDATED AND ANALYSIS THAT YOU'RE PROHIBITED FROM REQUIRING MORE IN THIRTY HOURS A DIRECT PARTICIPATION BUT ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT YOU OVERSEE FOR EXAMPLE NURSE PRACTITIONERS. AND SO- WITH NURSE PRACTITIONERS- SEEKING TO HAVE- MORE. INDEPENDENCE SHOULDN'T THEY BE. HELD A RALLY SOME SOME MORE SIMILAR STANDARD TO THAT OF PHYSICIANS AND OTHER- INDEPENDENT PRACTITIONERS IN TERMS OF NUMBER OF CREDITS AND THEY TAKE WHICH IS MORE ALONG THE LINES OF FIFTY CREDITS EVERY TWO YEARS. TO MAINTAIN THEIR THEIR SKILLS. THE SPEAKER THAT. I CAN. LOOK UP I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT- CURRENTLY WE HAVE TO FOLLOW WHAT'S IN STATUTE SURE. VERY REQUIREMENT IS THIRTY- SO WE CAN ONLY HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE TO THAT IF THAT IS SOMETHING THAT- THE LEGISLATIVE STAFF WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE WOULD BE THE BILL INTRODUCED TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL- SEE YEARS. OKAY ALL RIGHT I'LL JUST MAKE NOTE THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENTIAL THERE- THAT PERHAPS IT'S OUR JOB TO ADDRESS- THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. THANK YOU SENATOR PLAN ASSEMBLY MEMBER PAUL. THANK YOU TERRA- I I'D MAYBE THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT- THESE ISSUES I GUESS AND THE MORE EXPENSIVE FASHION BY SINCE I HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY. I DID WANT TO ASK ABOUT THE NURSING SHORTAGE AND WHAT THE B. R. INS- POSITION OR OR OR- OR- PROPOSED SOLUTIONS ARE. CERTAINLY FOR US IN THE CENTER VALLEY IN REAL COMMUNITIES AND THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM- INDEPENDENT MAKE AS CLEARLY EXACERBATED- THIS ISSUE IN OUR OUR NEED FOR MORE. NURSES AND- WE KNOW WE HAVE WAITING LISTS- FOR A NUMBER OF OUR NURSING PROGRAMS- THERE'S A LACK OF BRIDGE PROGRAMS SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. YEAH ONE OF YOU CAN JUST ANSWER A GIVE ME- YOUR- YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON HOW MANY STUDENTS WE NEED AND ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS TO MEET. THE STATE'S FUTURE NEEDS FOR NURSE PRACTITIONERS NURSE FACULTY NURSES NOT THAT'S THAT HEALTHCARE. NOT JUST POSITIVELY HOSPITALS BUT ALSO FOR A HOSPITALS AS WELL. THANK YOU- SO BY PULLING THE LICENSING DATA- I CAN SHARE WITH YOU THAT WE ARE UP ABOUT 4% IN- LICENSE FOR EXAMINATION. FROM LAST YEAR TO THIS YEAR. AND WE'RE UP ABOUT 8% TO GET ENDORSEMENTS INTO CALIFORNIA FROM LAST YEAR TO THIS YEAR SO WE ARE ACTIVELY SEEING THAT- THAT THEY SHORTAGE AREAS AND THE SHORTAGE IS BEING ADDRESSED- WHAT ARE BOARD HAS DONE IT WHICH- I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT AS WELL IS THAT IN TWENTY NINETEEN. THEY APPROVE SEVEN- ENROLLMENT INCREASES IN TWENTY TWENTY DURING THE HEIGHT OF THE BACKGAMMON THEY ALSO APPROVED FOR ENROLLMENT INCREASES. IN JUST THE FIRST HALF OF THIS YEAR ANOTHER COMING OUT THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT THEY HAVE APPROVED SIX- ENROLLMENT INCREASES IN JUST TO BOARD. AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR- THE OTHER THING THAT I WANT TO POINT OUT IS THAT E HAVE RECEIVED AND ACCEPTED FIVE FEASIBILITY STUDIES- AGAIN. AND WHAT A FEASIBILITY STUDY IS ACCEPTING THAT THERE IS A NEED IN AN AREA AND WE HAVE AN INSTITUTION OF SEEKING APPROVAL FOR THAT NURSING PROGRAM. WE HAVE RESPECTED THAT AS WELL- AND SO BE IT AND JUST OUR LAST BOARD MEETING WE ACCEPTED A SELF STUDY WHICH MEANS WE NOW HAVE A BRAND NEW NURSING PROGRAM- WHEN I STARTED AT THE BOARD IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WE HAD ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO PRE LICENSURE NURSING PROGRAMS- IN IN FIVE SHORT YEARS. WE HAVE- WE HAVE A HIGH BECAUSE AND FIFTY NURSING PROGRAMS THAT. RIGHT AND IN CALIFORNIA- THAT IS A AN ARDUOUS. FOR BOTH THE INSTITUTION AS WELL AS- ARE ANY SEASON OR BOARD MEMBERS TO REVIEW AND APPROVE. AND I'D LIKE TO JUST. PROVIDE TO THAT WE ARE DOING THAT AND WE ARE SEEING IMPROVEMENT. THE BILL MIGHT BE FOLLOWING UP YOU. CAN YOU PROVIDE YOU YOU INDICATED YOU WERE UP 4% AND TOTAL NURSES I BELIEVE. 8% ENDORSEMENT- THAT'S STATEWIDE SO DO YOU HAVE YOU DO YOU HAVE THOSE NUMBERS BROKEN DOWN BY REGION. I DID NOT COME PREPARED FOR THEM TO BE BROKEN DOWN BY REGION I CAN'T GET THAT INFORMATION TO YOU- WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THOUGH THAT WHEN THEY ARE PRESENTED. TO THE NURSING- BOARD THE BOARD MEMBERS DO RECEIVE REGIONAL DATA TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THE WORKFORCE SUPPORTS THAT AND WHETHER THE CLINICAL PLACEMENT SUPPORT THAT AND THE BOARD MEMBERS MAKE THEIR DECISIONS BASED ON THE DATA THAT YOU PRESENTED SO- THERE WOULD BE A NEED IN THAT AREA WHERE THE SCHOOLS WERE APPROVED- AND THAT WOULD BE THE PROCESS THAT WE WOULD FOLLOW. THROUGH YEARS OF THAT I UNDERSTAND THAT A MYERS MOVE INFORMATION IHAVE IS THAT THE BEER AND HAS SHARED DATA THAT ANNUALLY THERE ARE AT LEAST TWENTY TWO THOUSAND QUALIFIED STUDENTS WERE UNABLE TO ENTER INTO PROGRAMS. BECAUSE THE BEER AND HAS CAPTAINED ROMANCE BUT IN ALL IS ALSO CLAIMED THAT THERE IS NO SHOULD BE NO NURSING SHORTAGE IN MANY AREAS IS THAT STILL THE POSITION TO BE IRAN OR DO YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE SHORTAGES. GANKING CRITIC AND CRITICAL NEEDS IN AREAS OF THE STATE AND THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE- EXPANDED PROGRAMS AND EXPENDED. BRIDGE PROGRAMS AND EXPANDED A ROMAN. THERE ARE CERTAIN. IN AREAS THAT- THERE IS SHORTAGE OF NURSES THAT IS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT IN DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE SHARED. I DO WANT TO PASS THAT IN- I BELIEVE OUR FIRST AS SUNSET REPORT IT WAS SURE TO EIGHT NOW HAVE. ON LINE. SERVICES WE'RE AT THE DENTAL STUDENT CAN ACCESS AN ONLINE APPLICATION A SINGLE ONLINE APPLICATION AND THEIR APPLICATION IS SENT OUT TO UPWARDS TO TWO HUNDRED NURSING SCHOOLS- FOR THAT STUDENT TO APPLY. SO I THINK WE NEED TO CLEAN THE DATA TO FIND OUT EXACTLY HOW MANY NURSING STUDENTS ARE INDIVIDUAL- UNIQUE REQUEST VERSUS MULTIPLE REQUESTS GOING OUT TO THE SCHOOLS- PRIOR TO THAT TECHNOLOGY IT WAS EASY TO SAY THIS PERSON WENT TO. THIS SCHOOL AND THIS WAS IN- NOW WE NEED TO LOOK AT IT FROM A MORE TECHNOLOGY GOAL EIGHT WHERE- WE MIGHT BE TRACKING BY VARIOUS IDENTIFIERS SO THAT WE CAN PROVE THAT IT IS AN INDIVIDUAL AND UNIQUE REQUEST VERSES ONE STUDENT BLANKING OUT TWO HUNDRED SCHOOLS. THE REQUESTED GIRL NOW THAT THERE'S THE TECHNOLOGY TO SPREAD OKAY WELL I WOULD CERTAINLY APPRECIATE IF YOU COULD SHARE THAT THE DATA BY REGION I JUST RECENTLY HAD A CONVERSATION WITH A AND L. V. AND- IN BAKERSFIELD WHO ACTUALLY IS A FACULTY MEMBER. AT THE LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHO HAS BEEN ON A WAIT LIST FOR FIVE YEARS TO GET AN R. EIGHT TO GET INTO THE BRIDGE PROGRAM. TO BE AT OUR END. THAT'S TO. AN ATROCIOUS EGG OF HOW BACKLOGGED. AND HOW WE NEED TO FIX THE SYSTEM THAT FACULTY MEMBER TEACHING NURSING. CAN'T BECOME AN R. N. IN THAT SHE'S BEEN A WAITING LIST FOR FIVE YEARS FOR THE ONE PROGRAM THAT EXIST IN BAKERSFIELD- AND THAT'S A BIGGER SO THE NINTH LARGEST CITY IN CALIFORNIA. WE'RE NOT- YOU KNOW WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT NEEDS- THAT CLEARLY HAS BEEN SHOWN BY THE PANDEMIC HI I KNOW THAT WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT RECIPROCITY IN THE FUTURE SO I WILL I CAN HOLD MY QUESTIONS BUT YOU CARE. OR I CAN ASK- THE QUESTIONS THAT WITH WHATEVER THAT YOU WOULD LIKE. YOUR AVAILABLE. IF YOU WERE ABLE TO REMAIN WITH US UNTIL THROUGH THE NEXT PANEL THERE WOULD BE MIGHT BE HELPFUL I WILL ASK. OTHER MEMBERS IF THEY HAVE QUESTIONS ON THIS PARTICULAR PANEL. ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG IF NOT I'M PREPARED TO LET YOU PERSONAL MAYBE I MAYBE MY ONLY QUESTION AND I AND I WILL SAY FOR THE I TRY TO STAY FOR THE NEXT PANEL BUT- WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF THE BEER AND HAS- ANSWER OF HOW THEY'RE WORKING TO IMPROVE RECIPROCITY. AND I WILL THEN DEPART THE NEXT PANEL IF THE POPULAR AND COULD ANSWER THAT. I CAN'T- THE RECIPROCITY IS IN AND OUT OF STATE- SO WHAT I WOULD TALK TO IS OUR VERIFICATION PROCESS AND THAT'S- OUT. OF STATE. AND OUR ENDORSEMENT PROCESS WHICH IS IN STATE- OR OUT OF STATE VERIFICATION PROCESS- JUST IN APRIL WE RELEASED IT. ONLINE IT IS NOW AND- ONLINE PROCESS YOU CAN REQUESTED THROUGH BREEZE. AND YOU CAN PAY FOR IT THROUGH INCREASED. THAT'S A HUGE IMPROVEMENT AS PRIOR TO THAT IT WAS THE U. S. P. S. PROCESS AND YOU HAD TO SUBMIT A CHECK- SO. THAT WE'VE SEEN IMPROVEMENTS IN- WHEN I STEPPED INTO THIS ROLE I WAS MADE AWARE OF THAT WE HAD- LICENSE THAT WERE ON MICROPHONE. THAT MICROPHONE IS NOW BEEN DIGITALIZED AND WE CAN SEARCH THAT DOCUMENT- AND WHEN WE PUT THEM THERE ENTERED INTO GREECE. O THAT'S A BIG- STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND THAT HAPPENED LAST. FALL ADDITIONALLY. ON IT B. AND THIS IS. STRICTLY SPEAKING VERIFICATION OUT OF STATE SO THAT'S THE RECIPROCITY RIGHT IN AND OUT- OUR LICENSE VERIFICATION PAGE. DIRECTLY SPEAKS TO BREEZE AND SIR WHAT GREECE HAS. WHAT ARE PUBLIC HAS IN IT. WE ADDED THE FOR. THAT- THE APPLE. EITHER RECEIVED APPLICATION BY EXAMINATION OR APPLICATION. LICENSE BY- ENDORSEMENTS THAT'S IMPERATIVE BECAUSE THE OTHER BOARDS OF NURSING REQUESTED INFORMATION- I DO HAVE A MEETING WITH AND C-SPAN- IN I BELIEVE NEXT WEEK WHERE WE WILL DISCUSS THAT PROCESS AND I THINK THAT OUR VERIFICATION PROCESS GOING FORWARD TO BE SEAMLESS- THIS WEEK ABOUT THE MORE PRESSING ISSUE. WHICH IS THE ENDORSEMENT PROCESS AND THAT IS WHERE OUR AND I'M IN FROM OUT OF STATE. IN THE CALIFORNIA. I KNOW THAT THAT NURSING LICENSURE COMPACT WILL BE PRESENTED NEXT AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S LEGISLATION- GOING THROUGH THE OUR LEGISLATIVE PROCESS RIGHT NOW THAT A DRESS IS THAT- WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU BECOME PART OF A COMPACT. IS IT DOES ALLOW FOR EASE OF LICENSEES TO COME IN AND PRACTICE ON A TEMPORARY BASIS IN CALIFORNIA- THAT WILL GREATLY IMPROVE- THE TRAVELLING NURSES. THAT TEMPORARY STAFF- AND BORDER STAFF- SO IF YOU LIVED IN SAY LAS VEGASNEVADA AND YOU WANTED TO COME OVER AND WORK IN CALIFORNIA THAT THAT WOULD BEHOOVE YOU TO TRAVEL IN AND OUT- WHAT THAT DOESN'T ANSWER IS WHEN THE NURSE MOVES. CALIFORNIA WHEN THEY MOVED TO CALIFORNIA AND THEY TAKE UP RESIDENCE HERE THEY HAVE TO CHANGE THEIR PRIMARY STATE OF RESIDENCE. WHEN I PRIMARY STATE OF RESIDENCE IS CHANGE THAT'S DONE THE RAM DOOR SAME PROCESS. WHAT WE HAVE TO DO HERE IS FLOW THROUGH EVALUATION OF THEIR AT. TRANSCRIPTS TO ENSURE THAT THEY MEET OUR EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS. RECEIVE THEIR FINGERPRINT RESPONSE BACK FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. WE ALSO NEED TO CHECK THEIR LICENSE VERIFICATION THROUGH NURSES WHICH WE ARE A MEMBER OF WE ARE A MEMBER OF NURSES AND WE DO GET OUR LICENSE VERIFICATION THROUGH THEM. AND THEN THEY WE- MAKE SURE THAT OUR CURRENT AN ACTIVE LICENSE AND ONCE THEY'VE MET ALL THAT WE ENDORSE IN THE CALIFORNIA. THE ONE THING THAT WE ADDED DURING THIS PANDEMIC WHICH I THINK IS THAT BENEFIT IS- WHEN WE REVIEW THE APPLICATION ONCE WE RECEIVE IT A BIGGER PRICE BACK WHICH IS TYPICALLY THE BIGGEST DELAY BECAUSE THAT IS A LENGTHY PROCESS TO ANOTHER AGENCY- IF THEY'RE- HAVING ISSUES MEETING OUR LICENSE REQUIREMENTS FOR EDUCATION. AND THEN A TEMPORARY LICENSE. TEMPORARY LICENSE IS GOOD FOR SIX MONTHS- THEY CAN USE THAT SIX MONTHS TO CLEAR UP ANY EDUCATIONAL DEFICIENCIES. AND THEN THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXTEND THAT ADDITIONAL SIX MONTHS TO EQUAL ONE YEAR. IF THEY HAVE. CLASSES THAT NEED TO BE CLEARED UP SO THEY CAN BE LICENSE THEY CAN PRACTICE IN CALIFORNIA. UNDER THAT TEMPORARY LICENSE AND WE DO PROVIDE THAT TO THEM RIGHT NOW- WAIVER- WE- WITHOUT THEM HAVING TO DO AN ADDITIONAL APPLICATION ARE PAYING ADDITIONAL FEES- THE OTHER THING YOU. MENTIONED THE PANDEMIC ISWE HAVE AN AGREEMENT WITH THEM STOCK. THAT ALLOWS. FOR I THINK WE HAD. THOUSAND SIX THOUSAND I THINK AT ONE POINT WHEN I LOOKED LICENSE- ARE AND FROM OUT OF STATE WHO CAME INTO AND STUFF. A SEPARATE PROCESS FROM B. R. AND- SB ARE ATTACHED TO A FACILITY- THE FACILITY. TO M. STEP PROVIDES THEM WITH THE NEED. THEY HAVE A NURSES THAT ARE ASSIGNED TO THEM TO FILL IN DIFFERENT. ETHNIC WHEN THE STATE OF EMERGENCY ENDS AND THAT PANDEMIC IS OVER- THEN DATA AGREEMENT IS TERMINATED AND THOSE NURSES GO BACK TO THEIR STATE A REGION TO CONTINUE TO PRACTICE- AND THAT FACILITY THAT IS CONTRACTED WITH THEM ARE MADE AWARE THAT THEY ARE NO LONGER. ABLE TO PRACTICE HERE IN CALIFORNIA THREE OF SEVERAL WAYS- THROUGH VARIOUS AGENCIES TO HELP IN THAT PROCESS. THAT CONSERVE OUR FOREIGN. THANKS VERY MUCH. THANK YOU A NUMBER FOR. NEXT TO THE CHAIR LOW FOLLOWED BY SENATOR ARCHULETA DR WEBER. AND MEMBER DOLLY HELLO IF IT BECAME VERY MUCH A TEAR OFF AND- FOR THE THOSE ON THE ON THE CALL. I'VE NOT SEEN A SUCH A GREAT PARTICIPATION- FROM BOTH TO SET THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY. MEMBERS OF BUSINESS PROFESSIONS- FOR A SECOND- HEARING- IT JUST DEMONSTRATES THE LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT. SPECIFICALLY TO IRON OUT SO MANY OF THESE DIFFERENT ISSUES IN IN THE PUBLIC REALM SO I JUST WANT TO REAFFIRM THAT FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC OR NOT AND THE CHECK IN THE CHAMBERS. ALSO THINKING THAT CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR YOUR FULL PARTICIPATION. I'M IN THIS IS THAT TO MISS MEL B. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS IS WITH RESPECT OF LICENSING. TIMELINES I UNDERSTAND THAT AND WITH RESPECT TO REGULATION YOU'RE LICENSING TARGET TIMELINES FOR RESPONDING TO AN APPLICATION. IS NINETY DAYS OR APPROXIMATELY THREE MONTHS I JUST FOR A NEW NOTICE ALONE WHETHER AN APPLICATION IS ACCEPTED FOR FILING OR IS DEFICIENT. AT THAT POINT WHETHER ACCEPTED OR DEFICIENT IN AFRICAN WOULD STILL HAVE TO WAIT BEYOND THE NINETY DAYS. AND AS WE UNDERSTAND- STAFF HAS- IS ALLOWED TO TAKE CLOSE TO A YEAR TO THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY DAYS TO PROCESS AN APPLICATION AFTER. THE NINETY DAY- RESPONSE- AND WE ALSO SEE THAT THERE ARE SOME INTERNAL TARGETS BUT STILL THE RELIANCE ON THE NINETY DAY. REGULATIONS SO THE QUESTION IS WHY WOULD IT TAKE A THREE MONTHS JUST TO GO OVER AN APPLICATION TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT- IT IS- BUT NOT A CONTAINS THE NECESSARY DOCUMENTS BEFORE. A SUBSTANTIVE REVIEW. THE PROVIDER LITTLE CLEAR FOR ON THAT- BEEN NINETY DAYS IS THE STATUTE- YOU CAN SEE OUR PROCESSING TIMES OUR WEBSITE WE NEED ABOUT SIXTY DAYS THEY'RE STILL. DEFINITE AREA OF IMPROVEMENTS ALL PUT THAT OUT THERE TO BEGIN WITH WE DO HAVE A GOAL- TO MAKE THAT A LOT MORE- QUICK WITH THE INITIAL THE INITIAL REVIEW IF THEY ARE FOUND TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WHICH MEANS THEY'VE MET ALL OF OUR REGULATIONS THEIR LICENSE IMMEDIATELY THERE IS NO FURTHER DELAY IT SAID INITIAL REVIEW AND THEIR LICENSE. IT IS WHEN IT'S A DEFICIENCY DISCOVERED THAT WE NOTIFY THAT AND THERE WE NOTIFY THEM THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE. THAT WE'VE BEEN ALLOW FOR UP TO A YEAR BECAUSE THE BALL IS BACK INTO THE APPLICANT'S HANDS AT THAT POINT WE CANNOT FORCE THE APPLICATION TO SUBMIT DOCUMENTS- AND RESPONSE. FAST RATE SO WE HAVE TO GIVE THEM TIME WE DON'T WANT THEM TO HAVE THEIR LICENSE APPLICATION JUST KIND. OF VOTE AND THEY HAVE THE TIME TO RESPOND TO THAT SO DURING THAT ONE YEAR TIME PERIOD AFTER THEY'VE BEEN NOTIFIED THAT THERE'S A DEFICIENCY. THEY CAN GO AND REQUEST FINGERPRINTS THEY CAN GO IN CEMEX- I DO WAY TOO PASSED FOR LIKE PHOTO. THEY CAN SUBMIT TRANSCRIPTS SHOWING THAT THEY'VE MAX B. EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS- AND THAT ALLOWS FOR THEMTO DO THAT ONCE THEY RECEIVE THAT DOCUMENT BACK WE DO GO AHEAD. AND REVIEW THAT AND PUSH THAT OUT. NOW IT DOESN'T TAKE THREE MONTHS TO REVIEW AN APPLICATION SO I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT AS WELL IT TAKES UNDER AN HOUR TO REVIEW AN APPLICATION- WE HAVE A VERY LARGE VOLUME OF LICENSEES COMING IN. PRIMARILY THAT VOLUME COMES FROM CALIFORNIA ARE IN STATE SCHOOLS- WHEN LOOKING AT THE DATA COMPARISON FROM FROM OUT OF STATE TO IN STATE WOULD PROBABLY ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND THAT WE RECEIVE- FROM IN STATE ADDED TIME COMPARED TO ESPOUSING THAT WE RECEIVE FROM OUT OF STATE. SO MY FOCUS IS LAST YEAR'S BEEN WHAT CAN I DO TO INCREASE STATE- SPEED UP PROCESSING THOSE TWELVE THOUSAND IN STATE APPLICATIONS. THAT'S DONE THROUGH OUR ANY CAESAR NEC'S APPROVED THE CURRICULUM THEY WORK WITH THE PROGRAM DIRECTORS AND BECAUSE OF THAT WITH YOU CAN MOVE TO A LICENSE PROCESS WHICH HAS BEEN. RECOMMENDED THROUGH THE LIGHTING LICENSE PROJECT THAT WE MENTIONED IN OUR OPENING STATEMENT THIRTY CA- TO NOT. RECEIVE A TRANSCRIPT FROM THE SCHOOL. IN A FACT JUST RHYS. A GRAD ROSTER THAT IS CERTIFIED THAT SCHOOL SAYING THAT THAT. STUDENT HAS. WHEN THEY GRADUATED AND WHEN THEIR LAST YEAR ATTENDANCE WAS WHAT DEGREE THEY RECEIVED. ONCE WE HAVE THAT PROCESS IN PLACE THAT WILL BE AN AUTOMATED PROCESS RIGHT NOW IT'S A MANUAL PROCESS BUT TCA'S IT AND IT CONSULTANT THAT WE HIRED ARE WORKING ON AUTOMATING THAT PROCESS. SO ONCE WE RECEIVE THAT THE DEEDS IN THE DIRECTORS WILL NO LONGER HAVE TO SUBMIT- TRANSCRIPTS WHICH WILL BE A- TIME SAVE FOR THEM ACOSTA SAFE FOR THEM AND DECREASE SOME. ARDUOUS ED AFFECTS THEIR- AND ALLOW US TO. IMMEDIATELY GIVE THOSE STUDENTS THAT ARE IN STATE CALIFORNIA GRADS IN AT T. BARRING ANY. ENFORCEMENT ISSUES THAT IS STILL SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO. TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THE OTHER THING THAT WOULD REQUIRE SOME ADDITIONAL ARGUE IS IF THEY HAD ACCOMMODATIONS- BUT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT CHANGE IDC'S IDEAS ON IT AND I AM SURE WE WILL HAVE SOMETHING VERY SOON. THAT WILL ALLOW OUR IN STATE NURSING GRADS AND THE STUDENTS AT NURSING SCHOOL SORRY VIEW- HAPPY AUTOMATED PROCESS FOR THEM TO GO THROUGH A LICENSING DEPARTMENTS AND. AND THAT WILL SPEED THINGS UP GREATLY. WHAT DID YOU JUST THE FOLLOW THOUGH I ORDERS THAT- FOR HIM I THINK THE DATE WITH. THIRD A B. R. AND STAFF OUR CAN STAFF. THE BOARD IS AWARE THAT THE TIME WHEN THEY'RE OUT OF DATE IS THAT. IS THAT ACCURATE DOES THAT SOUND CORRECT. THERE IS A TWO TIME PERIODS OF THIS LAST YEAR- IT DURING THAT CRUX OF KOBE AND GOING TO A TELEWORK ENVIRONMENTS THAT WE EXCEEDED THE NINETY DAY PROCESSING. THAT IS CORRECT WE ARE NOT OUT OF COMPLIANCE NOW. IF WE WERE BROUGHT BACK INTO COMPLIANCE WITHIN ABOUT A TWO WEEK TIME PERIOD WE AUTHORIZED OVERTIME. AND WE PROVIDE ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT AND OTHER AREAS WITHIN THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING. OFFERED STAFF. NUMBER AND HELP. AND SO WE WERE ALL HANDS ON DECK AND WE GOT UNDERNEATH HER STATUTORY WE'VE MAINTAINED ABOUT A SIXTY DAY PROCESSING. EVERY OTHER TIME OTHER THAN THOSE TWO TIMES. WORK FOR THE BOARD IS. BUT KNOWLEDGE IS THAT THE LINES ARE OUT OF DATE. YES THE TIME LINES ARE OUT OF DATE AS A LICENSEE MYSELF WE WERE TOLD GREATER THAN- THREE MONTHS AFTER. I AM WORKING HARD TO GET THAT CHANGED AND THAT'S WHY I TALKED ABOUT THAT PROCESS IS GOING IN A PLACE. THAT WOULD BE WEEKS THAT WOULD NOT BE EVEN A MONTH ONCE THAT'S DONE AND TAKING CARE OF SO- MY FINGERS ARE CROSSED THAT WE CAN GET THIS OUT TO YOU OUR DEANS AND DIRECTORS- BY THE FALL. THE GREAT AND MOVIE WE WANT TO BE INVESTED IN YOUR SUCCESS TO HELPING TO UPDATE THOSE TIME LINES AS WELL TOO BUT CAN YOU THE FINAL QUESTION I HAVE IS ON THE PLAN OF ACTION THAT. DOES THE BOARD HAVE A PLAN SPECIFICALLY. TO UPDATE. ON UPDATE UPDATE THE STATUTE OR A STATE OR PROCESS PROCESS. PROCESS IS ALREADY BEING UPDATED- FORTY MEMBERS ARE AWARE I JUST SPOKE TO YOU SEE YOU AT AND C. C. AND I'M SHARING IT OUT TO THE WORLD- SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE PREPARED FOR THIS ISSUE WHEN IT COMES- BUT PROCESS IS ALREADY THERE WE'RE WORKING TO EXECUTE IT AS WE SPEAK IT'S IN DC AS HANDS- AND THERE ARE VERY VERY CONFIDENT. IS TO BE DONE IN. FIGURE IS PROBABLY. THANK YOU CHIRLA THANK YOU CENTER TOMORROW I THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I'D LIKE TO THANK- MORE PRESENTERS OBVIOUSLY THEY REPRESENT THE NURSING INDUSTRY IN A COURSE ALL OF US WOULD LIKE TO THANK EVERYONE- OUR FIRST RESPONDERS ARE NURSES AND DOCTORS FOR THE WORK THEY DID DURING THE PANDEMIC BUT I'VE BEEN HEARING THINGS THAT MAY BE FACTUAL MAYBE NOT MAYBE PERCEPTION. BUT HERE'S A SITUATION WE WATCHED ON TV WHERE NURSES ARE JUST SITTING ON THE FLOOR EXHAUSTED WORKING TWELVE FOURTEEN SIXTEEN HOURS A DAY WHATEVER IT WAS OBVIOUSLY THAT SHOW THERE WASN'T ENOUGH NURSES SHOW AS YOU CAN HEAR OUR PANELING COMMITTEE HERE ARE ASKING WHY IS IT TAKING SO LONG SO I'M PIGGY BACKING ON THAT. WHEN SOMEONE GRADUATES FROM THE SCHOOL AND- IS GOOD PROCESSING AND I UNDERSTAND THAT I'VE BEEN TOLD IT TAKES UP TO SIX MONTHS AND THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE GRADUATING THEY GRADUATE RATHER THEY'RE WAITING TO GET EMPLOYMENT AND HERE YOU GO SIX MONTHS LATER THEN THEY FINALLY GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO PRACTICE- IN SO I HAVE TO EMPHASIZE THAT YOU MUST FIND A WAY TO EXPEDITE THIS- OBVIOUSLY YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU'RE DOING A LITTLE BIT BETTER JOB. BUT WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING IS IT JUST THAT TERRIBLE PERCEPTION THAT THE PUBLIC HAS THAT THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH NURSES WE HAD BRING NURSES FROM OUTSIDE THE STATE- AND OF COURSE THE HOSPITALS HAD TO PAY MORE MONEY- FOR THEIR TRAVEL THEIR STAY AND EVERYTHING ELSE WHEN WE HAVE A AN ABUNDANCE OF NURSES IN SCHOOLS THAT HAVE GRADUATED THAT WE COULD'VE EXPEDITED AND GOTTEN INTO THE SYSTEM. SO. YOUR COMMENTS ON THAT PLEASE. YEAH COUPLE THINGS THAT I CAN ANSWER WITH THAT- WE ALREADY SEES WORK WITH OUR NURSING DEANS AND DIRECTORS WITH THE GETTING EDUCATION OUT WHAT WE SEE TYPICALLY HAPPENS IS THE NURSING STUDENT IS. VERY VERY EXCITED TO GRADUATE THEY GOING TO BE PRETTY BREEZE ACCOUNTS AND THEY APPLY. THAT CAN BE TWO TO FOUR WEEKS IN ADVANCE OF THEM GRADUATING. AND ONCE THEY GRADUATE THE DEAN OR DIRECTOR HAS TO ACTUALLY GRADUATE STUDENTS OUT OF THEIR SYSTEM THAT GOES TO THE REGISTRATION PROCESS OF THE SCHOOL. AND THEY PROCESS THAT THAT CAN TAKE UP TO FOUR WEEKS FOR. US IS THAT AND YET THEIR TRANSCRIPTS OUT AND ISSUE THEM A DEGREE. THEN WITH THAT THEY UPLOAD THOSE TRANSCRIPTS TO THE CLOUD AND WE ACCESS AND THERE AND THEN WE START TO PROCESSING. WITH THE STUDENT DOESN'T UNDERSTAND IS THAT TWO TO FOUR WEEKS THAT THEY'VE APPLIED PRIOR TO GRADUATION WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITH THEY HAVEN'T MET THE REQUIREMENTS THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO BE TO THE PROGRAM. THEN WITH THE NURSING PROGRAM HAVING AFTER ABOUT FOUR WEEKS TO GET TRANSCRIPTS THAT'S AN EIGHT WEEK DELAY THAT THE STUDENT IS SEEN PRIOR TO US EVEN RECEIVING AND PROCESSING YOUR APPLICATION. SO THAT IS WHY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT IS WHAT WE DO TO NOT HAVE TO USE A TRANSCRIPT AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT DOING THAT GRADUATE CANDIDATE ROSTER. WE'RE ALL THE NURSING THREE DIRECTORS HAVE TO DO IS SUBMIT A LIST OF NAMES THAT DEGREE THAT THEY RECEIVED THAT LASTED OF ATTENDANCE AND THE DEGREE DATE THAT THAT WAS- ACQUIRED. SO THAT WAY WE CAN FIX THAT THE OTHERTHING THAT I WANT TO BRING OUT- SO THAT YOU GUYS ARE AWARE OF IS EACH ONE OF OUR APPLICATIONS BY EXAM AND SO THAT'S THE FIRST TIME NURSE THEY HAVEN'T TAKEN THE AND COLLECTS EXAMINATION YET. HAS THE OPTION TO APPLY FOR AN INTERIM PERMIT. BACK IN TERM PERMIT IS GRANTED AND THEY CAN WORK ON THAT UNTIL. THEY TAKE B. AND CLASS. ONCE THEY TAKE THE LACKS THEY DON'T NEED AN INTER PERMITTING MORE BECAUSE THEY TOOK THE BECOME A LICENSE. BUT THEY DO HAVE THAT INTERIM PERMIT PROCESS AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE OFFER TO THEM. NOW IF THEY FAIL THE AND CLACK'S. BE INTER PERMIT IS CANCELLED THE END CLICKS IS THE- TEST THAT WE USE THAT ENSURES THAT THEY HAVE A MINIMUM BASE COMPETENCE. AND IF THEY FAIL THAT EXAM WE CANNOT HAVE THEM OUT THERE ON THE INTERNET PRACTICING ANYMORE BECAUSE IN FACT TO BE EXAM THAT DETERMINES THAT THEIR STATE HAS DETERMINED THAT THEY'RE NOT STATE. THAT THOSE ARE A COUPLE THINGS TO DO. THE OTHER THING THAT DURING THE STATE OF EMERGENCY THROUGH- THE EXECUTIVE ORDER- THAT BEAT BISBEE PC COULD TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY SEVEN CAME INTO A FAX. AND WITH THAT IT ACTUALLY ALLOWED FOR ALL NURSING STUDENTS TO IMMEDIATELY HELP- WEOFFERED ON OUR WEBSITE AND EIGHT MATRIX FOR EMERGENCY. AND BY DATA BIRDS THE USE AND MAY BE LICENSE HEALTHCARE FACILITIES CAN ABSOLUTELY UTILIZE THAT UTILIZE OUR STUDENTS EVEN WHILE THEY'RE IN THEIR NURSING PROGRAM. TO HELP OUT THOSE FRONT LINE WORKERS WHO ARE ABSOLUTELY EXHAUSTED- ACTUALLY LIKE TO GET MY BOARD PRESIDENT A CHANCE TO CHIME IN ON THIS AND KIND OF. TALK ABOUT THE CODE EFFECTS IF YOU WANT TO AS SHE IS A AB. FRONTLINE DIRECT CARE NURSE. PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU SENATOR- ARE TO A- AS A FRONTLINE ARE AND- WE ARE HI MIKE IN OVERHEAD AB DE UM. HOUSE. WHICH REQUIRED QUITE A FEW ARE AND TO CARE FOR THESE PATIENTS- MY WORK IN THIS PHOTO WHAT'S REALLY. LESS OF A FRONT END OF IT AND MORE OF A REAL OUT OF IT IS I'M IN YOUR NATAL INTENSIVE CARE NURSE. SO I CAN'T SPEAK FOR DIRECT. TO BEING A FRONTLINE WORKER BUT I DID HEALTH CARE OR INSENSIBLE OF KOBE. SO THEN I WOULD ENCOURAGE- I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THAT. THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION- HE HAS FROM LORETTA MELKY ARE EXECUTIVE OFFICER. MR PRESIDENT I'D LIKE THE AND ONCE AGAIN THANKING YOU AND- AND THANK YOU THE ENTIRE NURSING INDUSTRY FOR THAT THE WORK YOU'VE GIVEN US TO SACRIFICE AND- THE LOVE YOU'VE GIVEN ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEN YOU TRULY ARE RECOGNIZED AND WE RECOGNIZE THREE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE CHAMBER. AND- PLEASE CONTINUE THE GOOD WORK. PLEASE LOOK INTO EXTRADITING SO WE CAN GET THE STUDENTS THROUGH THE SYSTEM AND HOWEVER YOU CAN DO THAT- I WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT THANK YOU. THE REPORT OF DOCTOR WEBER. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE WHO IS ON THE PANEL- AND YOU KNOW LIKE WAS SAID BY SENATOR ARE TO LET I'D LIKE TO THANK ALL OF THOSE. HEALTHCARE WORKERS I WAS WITH YOU ON THE FRONT LINES. TAKING CARE OF THE PUBLIC PATIENTS AND WE KNOW IT'S NOT JUST THE NURSES IN THE HOSPITALS IS THE ONES THAT WERE IN OUTPATIENT FACILITIES AS WELL. WE HAD MANY PATIENTS COME THROUGH CLINICS THAT ENDED UP TESTING POSITIVE THAT WERE INITIALLY SEEN BY OUR NURSES THANK YOU. VERY MUCH FOR THAT WORK. I WANT TO GO BACK TO- THE DISCUSSION THAT. WE'VE HAD CONCERNING THE SHORTAGE OF NURSES SPECIFICALLY IN CERTAIN AREAS. AND WHAT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER WITH THAT- I THINK YOU SAID IN TWENTY NINETEEN. OR TWENTY TWENTY YOU INCREASE THE ENROLLMENT- AT SOME OF THE NURSING- THE SCHOOLS ARE KIND OF WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE CAPTAIN ENROLLMENT NUMBERS. AND HOW DOES A SCHOOL GOAL ABOUT- GETTING AN INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF STUDENTS THAT THEY'RE ALLOWED TO HAVE AND IS THERE A FEE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. THANK YOU NUMBER- I WOULD LIKE THAT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICER. LARA MEL B. GIVE ME THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION. THANK YOU- THERE IS A PROCESS- A MAJOR CURRICULUM REVISION IS- ESTABLISHING REGULATION STATUTE IT DOES REQUIRE A TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR FEE. AND WHAT IS DONE IS THE NURSING PROGRAM REACHES OUT TO THE NURSING EDUCATION CONSULTANT. THE STATE DEAD NEED BAG EVIDENCE BEHIND THAT SUPPORTS THAT NEED- AND THEIR ABILITY TO- SUPPORT THE STUDENTS THROUGH THE PROCESS. ONCE THEY'VE SUBMITTED THE REQUEST- STATED THE NEED AND HOW THEY WOULD FOLLOW UP WITH THAT THEY PROVIDE- DOCUMENTATION BACK AND FORTH WITH THE NURSING EDUCATION CONSULTANT THAT EVALUATES RESOURCES. THE NURSING EDUCATION CONSULTANT LOOKS AT- WILL BE A FACULTY THE AVAILABILITY OF- IF IT'S A BRICK AND MORTAR CAMPUS- ON GROUND CAMPUS DEEPLY HAVE CLASSROOM SIZE THAT CAN'T AND- ACCOMMODATE AN INCREASED NUMBER OF STUDENTS. DO THEY HAVE- TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL ACCOMMODATE THE INCREASED NUMBER SERVICE IT WAS STUDENTS DO THEY HAVE A NUMBER OF COMPUTERS AVAILABLE FOR THEIR STUDENTS IF THEY DO ONLINE TESTING. OR ONLINE EXAMS ARE ONLINE LECTURES. IN ADDITION TO HAVE AN ADEQUATE- SKILLS LAB SIMULATION LAB- DO THEY HAVE STAFF THAT CAN SUPPORT THAT DO THEY HAVE A BUDGET TO. PAY FOR THE FACULTY'S WAGES THE SUPPORT SERVICES IN THE SUPPORT STAFF BETTER THERE- BAIT VARIOUS EQUIPMENT- ONCE THAT IS ESTABLISHED AND THAT WOULD YOU SEE THAT THERE IS A PLAN THAT BUDGETARY PLANET FACULTY PLAN A RESOURCE IS PLANNED FOR- FACILITIES ETCETERA. AND ULTIMATE- WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS CLINICAL SPACE PART OF OUR REQUIREMENTS IS THAT STUDENTS. DO HANDS ON DIRECT PATIENT CARE- AS PART OF THAT REQUIREMENT THAT STAND IN THE OUTPATIENT SETTING AN ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL SETTING- VARIOUS DIFFERENT MODALITIES CAN BE DONE TO MEET THOSE- DIRECT PATIENT CARE HOURS. WITH THOSE DIRECT PATIENT CARE HOURS BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE OUT IN THE COMMUNITY WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COMMUNITY IS ABLE TO SUPPORT THE INCREASING- ENROLLMENT THE REQUESTED AS WELL. THAT IS DONE BY EVALUATING CLINICAL ACTION. LOOKING AT THE CLINICAL IMPACTION WE LOOK TO SEE IF THERE IS THEIR CLINICAL ACTION THERE MAY NOT BE IN SOME AREAS THERE'S A WORKFORCE NEED. AND HAVE ADEQUATE CLINICAL PLACEMENTS THOSE ARE EASY ONES FOR OUR BOARD MEMBERS TO EVALUATE WHEN IT'S PRESENTED TO THEM. WHEN THERE IS NOT A WORKFORCE NEED. OR THERE IS NOT CLINICAL SITES TO ACCOMMODATE THE ENROLLMENT INCREASE REQUEST AND THAT IS- A MUCH BIGGER- DECISION THAT OUR BOARD MEMBERS HAVE TO MAKE- FOR THEM TO LOOK AT WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO SEE IS THAT SCHOOLS. STUDENTS ENROLLED IN SCHOOLS IN THAT AREA ARE READY. ARE DISPLACED BECAUSE WE'VE INCREASE ENROLLMENT IN YOUR BY SCHOOL- WE WANT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ALREADY ENROLLED IN SCHOOL TO BE ABLE TO COMPLETE AND NOT RUN AGAINST ANY ISSUES HAVE NOT BEEN OKAY BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A CLINICAL. SITE DO YOU THEIR HOURS ACT. SO WITH THAT ONCE THE NURSING EDUCATION CONSULTANT HAS ESTABLISHED THAT THEY'VE MET ALL THE RULES AND REGULATIONS OUTLINED IN LAW. THAT INFORMATION. IS PRICED EDUCATION LICENSED COMMITTEE. ASEMAN LICENSE COMMITTEE GOES AHEAD AND REVIEWS THE DATA THAT WAS PRESENTED TO THEM. TALKS TO THE DEEDS OF DIRECTOR TALKS TO THAT CAMPUS PRESIDENT OR THE VICE PRESIDENT OR- THE CFO OF THAT SCHOOL- TO ENSURE THAT THE DATA THAT WAS RECEIVED WAS ACCURATE AND THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THE UNDERTAKING THAT THEY'RE TAKING THAT COMMITMENT. HAVE TO THOSE STUDENTS WHO CHOOSE THEIR SCHOOL TO GO TO- AND RECEIVE THEIR SECRETIVE AND A COMMITMENT THEY HAVE TO THAT COMMUNITY. ONCE IT'S BEEN ESTABLISHED AND THAT COMMITTEES BEEN ABLE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION THAT COMMITTEE MAKES A RECOMMENDATION TO THE BOARD AND THE BOARD ADDITIONALLY HAS A CHANCE TO MEET WITH THE DEANS AND DIRECTORS THE VICE PRESIDENT THE PRESIDENT'S- ANYBODY THAT IS REPRESENTING THAT INSTITUTION THAT'S REQUESTING THAT A ROMAN PRIEST. AND THEN VERIFIES WITH THE NURSING EDUCATION ASSAULT AT THE DATA SUBMITTED IT IS- ACCURATE AS FAR AS THEY CAN DETERMINE AS WELL BASED ON THEIR EXPERIENCE AND THE NUMBER IS MADE. AND ENROLLMENT INCREASES EITHER GRANTED OR DENIED IF IT'S GRANTED. THE SCHOOL BECAUSE I HAD NEVER MONTHS THAT IF IT'S DENIED IT PROVIDED FEEDBACK ON WHAT MIGHT NEED TO BE- CORRECTED OR- PRESENTED IN ORDER FOR THEM TO COME BACK AND RE PRESENT HIMSELF TO THE BOARD. ONCE THE BOARD RECEIVED AT DATA OKAY NOT A CHANCE TO MAKE THAT DECISION IS DONE. ADDITIONAL FEES ARE NOT RECEIVED IT IS JUST A ONE TIME FEE AS THEY GO THROUGH THAT ENTIRE APPROVAL PROCESS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT- IT IT ACTUALLY SEEMS LIKE A VERY EXPENSIVE AND LENGTHY PROCESS FOR SCHOOL TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH. ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT WE ARE ALREADY TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OF NURSES AND CERTAIN AREAS. I DON'T KNOW IF THE BOARD HAS EVER CONSIDERED BEING A LITTLE BIT MORE PRO ACTIVE IN THIS ARENA. BY LOOKING AT CERTAIN AREAS THAT. YOU SHOULD ALREADY KNOW BY YOUR DATA AND A LOT OF THAT INFORMATION YOU SHOULD PROBABLY ALREADY HAVE FROM. YOU KNOW THEIR PREVIOUS APPLICATION THIS FAR AS WHAT. I WHAT HOW MANY FACULTY THEY HAVE IN. TECHNO AND SENIOR I MEAN ALL OF THAT STUFF YOU ALSO ALREADY HAVE. I WOULD THINK THAT IT BE- PRETTY EASY TO JUST. LOOK AT YOUR OWN DATA AND LOOK THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO SEE WHERE SHORTAGES ARE. AND STARTED PRO ACTIVELY TARGET CERTAIN SCHOOLS TO SAY HEY. WE THINK THAT SHE WOULD BE A GREAT CANDIDATE FOR AN ENROLLMENT INCREASE. YOU KNOW IS IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO DO THAT RATHER THAN PUTTING THE BURDEN ON THE SCHOOLS ESPECIALLY SINCE WE HAVE ON A SHORTAGE OF NURSES ALREADY. THIS IS SOMETHING TO CONSIDER BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE A VERY- EXPENSIVE AND ARDUOUS PROCESS FOR SCHOOL TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH. WHEN WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THERE IS A NEED THROUGHOUT THE STATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU- THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE BOARD CAN CONSIDER WE CAN LOOK AT THAT PROCESS THE ONE THING THAT I DO WANT TO POINT OUT IS THE CLINICAL PLACEMENT ISSUE. THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING DOES NOT HAVE ANY JURISDICTION OVER A LICENSED HEALTH CARE FACILITIES. THE LICENSE HEALTHCARE FACILITIES ARE OPERATED UNDERNEATH CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH. THANK LICENSE HEALTHCARE FACILITIES HAVE NO- HEY. REQUIREMENTS REPORT TO US THAT THEY HAVE CLINICAL SITES AVAILABLE- THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S IN STATURE REGULATION ACT. SO WHEN WE CAN LOOK AT OUR DATA BASED ON- WE KNOW HOW MANY STUDENTS ARE IN THAT AREA. WE CAN LOOK AT OUR DATA TO SEE HOW MANY FACULTY HERE AVAILABLE IN THAT AREA THAT IS THE DATA THAT WE OWN WE ALSO OWN YOU KNOW THE LICENSEE WHO HAS A- A RESIDENCE THAT THEY PUT ON THEIR LICENSE APPLICATION WERE. IN THAT AREA WE HAVE THAT DATA THE DATA THAT WE DON'T HAVE IS THE CLINICAL PLACEMENT DATA- WHY THEY HEALTHCARE FACILITIES. THE LICENSE HEALTHCARE FACILITIES DO NOT HAVE A REQUIREMENT IN THE STATUTE OR RAPES REPORT THAT DATA HOW- AND AGAIN TO THEIR GOVERNMENT THROUGH C. P. H. SO THAT WE WOULD. DEFINITELY WANT TO PURSUE THAT THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN DO BUT WE NEED TO HAVE THAT DATA. FROM THE LICENSE HEALTH CARE FACILITIES THAT TELL US WHICH SCHOOLS THEY'RE CONTRACTED WITH HOW MANY STUDENTS THEY HAVE. AND WHAT SPECIALTY AREAS THOSE STUDENTS BELONG TO OUR THE RESPIRATORY THERAPIST MEDICAL ASSISTANCE ARE THEY PHYSICIANS PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS NURSE PRACTITIONERS. ARE THE NURSES- LICENSE VOCATIONAL NURSES YOU KNOW WHO WAS IN YOUR FACILITY AND WHAT CAME YOUR STAFF IN YOUR FACILITY A COMEDY- AND THAT'S DATA THAT'S NOT OWNED BY THE B. R. MAN AND WE HAVE NO JURISDICTION OVER THAT. RIGHT YEAH I'M SURE THAT THAT DATA IS INFORMATION THAT THE SCHOOLS WOULD BE MORE THAN WILLING TO GIVE ABOUT THE CLINICAL PLACEMENT- AND IT YOU KNOW AND NOW WITH CODE RED AND THE USE OF- SIMULATOR MORE- I KNOW IT'S ALWYS IMPORTANT TO HAVE AT LEAST SOME HANDS ON EXPERIENCE WHEN YOU'RE GOING THROUGH TRAINING IN THE HEALTHCARE PROFESSION- BUT EVEN MEDICAL SCHOOLS UTILIZE I. YOU KNOW STIMULATE AT THIS. SO I'M GLAD THAT THE IS THE- IN SO SOMETIME WE DO HAVE TO THINK OF. THE WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO PROVIDE MORE ACCESS AND MORE CARE MORE PEOPLE. AND START LOOKING AT OTHER OPPORTUNITIES AND- CHANGING AROUND LIKE WHAT KIND OF ROTATIONS IN IMPLEMENTING NEW THINGS IN THEIR SELF. BUT I'M I'M SURE THAT THE SCHOOL TO BE MORE THAN WILLING TO GIVE YOU THAT KIND OF INFORMATION AND LIKE I SAID WE CAN START THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE. STILL TRAINING VERY QUALITY NURSES THAT ARE ABLE TO PASS THEIR EXAM ONCE HE FINISED- BUT ALSO INCREASING THE AMOUNT IN THE ACCESS HERE INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR WEBER ASSEMBLYMEMBER DOLLY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MY QUESTION IS FOR MISS MEL B. I'VE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH TWO OF THE NURSING- COLLEGES IN MY DISTRICT BECAUSE OF THE SISKIYOU AND SHASTA NURSING PROGRAM THEIR ADMINISTERS EVERY MINISTER TO REACHED OUT ON BECAUSE THEY'RE HAVING A VERY DIFFICULT TIME RECRUITING AND RETAINING FULL TIME FACULTY FOR THEIR PROGRAMS. BECAUSE THEY CAN'T BE COMPETITIVE OUTSIDE OF THE JUST WORKING INSIDE OF THE SCHOOL SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE R. AND HAS THREE- REGULATIONS THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO HIRE PART TIME FACULTY. AND THAT I- THAT'S NOT JUST IN MY DISTRICT BUT I'M HEARING THAT STATEWIDE AS WELL SO MY QUESTION IS. WHAT ARE THE EXISTING RESTRICTIONS ON HIRING PART TIME FACULTY AND WHY ARE THEY NECESSARY- JUST AN AREA OF CLARIFICATION WE DO NOT HAVE ANY ANGRY ANY REGULATION ANY STATUTE. THAT LOOKING AT. PART TIME FULL TIME PER DIEM FACULTY- AND SO JUST TO PROVIDE THAT CLARIFICATION I AM AWARE THAT THERE ARE- SOME DIFFICULTIES IN GETTING FACULTY. I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THAT HERE. WHERE WE HAVE THREE DIFFERENT PATHWAYS WITH THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING ON GETTING- APPROVAL FOR FACULTY. YOU CAN HAVE AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE IN NURSING ONE YEAR OF EXPERIENCE- IN A SPECIALTY AREA AND APPLIED FOR- FACULTY APPROVAL WE WOULD THEN APPROVE YOU AS A- CLINICAL TEACHING ASSISTANT. CLINICAL TEACHING pCLINICAL ROTATIONS CAN ASSIST IN THE LAB- AND CANNING YES TEACH- OCCASIONALLY AND ASK BE REBASED CLASSROOM. THE NEXT- AVENUE THAT WE HAVE FOR FACULTY IS A BACHELOR'S PREPARED NURSE. WITH ONE YEAR EXPERIENCE AT THE BEDSIDE. THAT VOUCHERS- NURSE CAN THEN APPLY TO BE FACULTY. AND THAT FACULTY MEMBER. CAN BE REACHED AT SYSTEMS INSTRUCTOR BETTER SYSTEM INSTRUCTOR CAN HAVE DIRECT OVERSIGHT OF THAT CLINICAL GROUP. THEY CAN ALSO ASSIST IN THE LAB AS WELL AS ASSIST IN- THE THEORY AS LONG AS THEY HAVE A LEAD INSTRUCTOR. OVER THEM. FINALLY THAT LAST HALF WAY FOR FACULTY THAT THE BEER AND HAS IS A MASTER'S DEGREE PREPARED NURSE. THE MASTER'S DEGREE PREPARED NURSE HAS- EDUCATION AND CURRICULUM ONE THEORY. ON THE CLASSROOM DEVELOPMENT CLASSROOM MANAGEMENT CURRICULAR DESIGN- AND WE'VE BEEN APPROVED THEM AS A FACULTY MEMBER THAT FACULTY MEMBERS APPROVED AS AN INSTRUCTOR. WHERE YOU RUN INTO SOME ISSUES IS CREDITING BODIES. ONLY LOOK AT MASTER DEGREE PREPARE NURSES ABOVE AND IN FACT HAD- SOME OF THEIR GUIDELINE WHERE THEY WILL TO TERMINAL SERVER YOU WANT THAT TO BE A TEACHER. IN P. AND THEY WANT THAT 2 DEGREES FOR FIVE- BAGGY. HARD BECAUSE AS WE KNOW IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S A DEEP CREASE NUMBER TERMINAL DEGREE PREPARED NURSES THERE IS A DECREASE NUMBER OF SCHOOLS THAT OFFER OFFERED TO THE TERMINAL DEGREE- SO WITH THE B. R. AND AVENUE TO FACULTY WE ACTUALLY ENCOMPASS THE ASSOCIATE DEGREE NURSE. WHICH IS A TWO YEAR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREES A FOUR YEAR AND THEN A MASTER'S DEGREE OR GRADUATE LEVEL NURSES THAT CAN ACTUALLY SERVICE FACULTY- IT IS DIFFICULT THOUGH BECAUSE AS YOU HAVE POINTED OUT WHICH IS ACTUALLY CORRECT IS THE ABILITY FOR FINANCIALLY SUPPORTING THE- FACULTY MEMBER. WHAT HAPPENS HE IS AT THE BEDSIDE NURSE THAT DIRECT PATIENT CARE NURSE THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE MUCH MORE MONEY IN THAT ROLE THAN THEY DO IN- AND EDUCATION WALL- AND THAT'S WHERE OU GET A SALARY DIVIDE AND THAT IS PROBLEMATIC. YOU KNOW BECAUSE IF. THEY USUALLY REQUIRE. REIST EXPIRY- DEGREE. BUT THEN THEY DON'T HAVE TO CALL PAY WHEN THE OUT TO ACADEMIC IT'S TO. SOON KNOWING THAT THAT THE CHALLENGE TO HOLD THOSE QUALIFIED- NURSES INSTEAD OF HIGHLY QUALIFIED IN ORDER TO CONSTRUCT FUTURE NURSES OF COURSE WOULD. MAKE SENSE BUT IS THAT SOMETHING THAT THE BEER AND IS LOOKING OUT ON HOW WE'RE GOING TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN BECAUSE IF WE DON'T HAVE INSTRUCTORS. IT WON'T IT DOESN'T MATTER IF WE OPEN UP MORE SLOTS THROUGHOUT SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT THE STATE IF WE DON'T HAVE INSTRUCTORS SO. FOR INSTANCE OF THE CALLS AT THIS YEAR'S WE HAVE ONE INSTRUCTOR AND THEY DIDN'T GRADUATE ONE NURSE THIS WHOLE YEAR. SO YOU HAVE A PROGRAM THAT'S ACCREDITED WAITING FOR PEOPLE TO APPLY TO BUT THEY CAN'T GET IN BECAUSE YOU ONLY HAVE ONE INSTRUCTOR SO I THINK IT'S- DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT. IF WE CAN PARTNER WITH YOU TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN SPECIFICALLY INSTRUCTORS I THINK OF THE ALL OF US HERE. WOULD AGREE THAT THAT'S HIGHLY IMPORTANT. YES IT IS IN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'M DOING TO ADDRESS THAT IS I AM WORKING WITH THE C. A. S. I. I. T. TO CREATE A FACULTY DATABANK. AND SO WHAT WE ARE DOING WITHIN THE BRN IS WE WILL PUT IN EVERY SINGLE PROOF FACULTY. AND THE LOCATION WITH THEIR LICENSE ON TO WHERE THE ACT AND WILL BE ABLE TO GO IN TO THIS DATA BANK ONCE IT'S COMPLETED AND- PUBLISHED TO OUR WEBSITE- TO FIND OUT WHERE FACULTY ARE SO THAT THEY CAN TRY TO FIND THEM SO THAT'S A SERVICE THAT I THINK THAT WE CAN OFFER- I HAVE EXPLORED THAT- I WAS A FACULTY MEMBER MYSELF- AND I WAS THE DIRECTOR OF NURSING MYSELF AS WELL PREVIOUSLY. COMING INTO THIS ROLE SO I KNOW THAT THE SHORTAGE WAS REAL- AND I WISH I KNEW WHERE I COULD FIND FACULTY SO- BY PROVIDING THIS SERVICE WILL BE WITH. THIS YEAR'S START CONVERSATIONS AND WE'RE WORKING ON THAT- WE'RE HOPING TO TIE THAT BACK UP TO YOU. IT IS A BREEZE SYSTEM AND HAVE THAT PUT OUT AS PART OF THEIR LICENSE AND THEN REPORTED OUT THROUGH TABLEAU ON TO OUR WEBSITE. THROUGH AN INTERACTIVE- STATE MAP THAT WILL SAY WEIRD THAT NURSING FACULTY ARE WHERE THE PERCENTAGES OF NURSING FACULTY OZARK AND THEN WHAT THEIR SPECIALTY IS AS WELL. SO I'M HOPING THAT. THAT'S A SERVICE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE VERY SOON. THANK YOU MEMBERS. CALLING THE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS CAN. LET ME- LET ME ASK TWO QUESTIONS JUST TO PERHAPS TEE IT UP FOR OUR NEXT- NEXT PANEL DISCUSSION I MAY HAVE MISSED THIS- AND BY THE WAY MS BOBBY THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH FOR BOTH OF YOU FOR PARTICIPATING IN FOR THE- THOROUGHNESS OF YOUR RESPONSES MUCH APPRECIATED. WITH RESPECT TO APPLICATIONS FOR ENDORSEMENT MAYBE YOU MENTIONED THIS BUT HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO SECURE A TEMPORARY LICENSE ASSUMING THAT. THAT VERSION OF LICENSES AVAILABLE UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES. AS SOON AS WE GET FINGERPRINTS BACK FROM D. O. J. WE PROCESS THEM THAT DAY PERFECT AND THEN THAT THAT COMPLETELY LEADS INTO MY SECOND QUESTION BUT WE'VE HAD THE CONVERSATION ABOUT FINGERPRINTS FINGERPRINT CARDS AND- AND THAT THOSE ISSUES- DURING OUR LAST- ONE OF OUR HEARINGS IN ANY EVENT. WHAT- HAS THE BOARD BEGAN TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO FIND WAYS TO EXPEDITE THIS FINGERPRINT PROCESS ASSUMING THAT IT CAN BE EXPEDITED I REALIZE THAT IT'S COMPLETELY OUTSIDE OF THE CONTROL OF THE BORDER REGISTERED NURSES. IT'S OUTSIDE OF THE CONTROL I THINK A DOJ AS WELL- SO BY CALIFORNIA LAW IT IS REQUIRED THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE PERMISSION TO SHARE YOUR FINGERPRINTS AND SO THAT PERMISSION COMES FROM WHEN THAT PERSON IS SENSE IN THERE ARE CARD OR DOES THEIR LIVES AGAIN. AS I'M SURE YOU GUYS ARE VERY WELL AWARE THE LIVE SCAN PROCESS CAN ONLY BE COMPLETED IN THE STATE THAT YOU DO THE LIVE SCAN ACT SO WHEN YOU'RE INDOORS THING IN CALIFORNIA. THE INNATE PROBLEM THERE IS YOU'RE COMING FROM OUT OF STATE AND UNLESS YOU TRAVEL IN THE CALIFORNIA AND TAKE YOUR LIVES GABBY IN CALIFORNIA IT CANNOT BE SAID TO A CALIFORNIA ENTITY. SO THAT IS- PROBLEMATIC FOR OUT OF STATE ENDORSING NURSES AND- SOME DO YOU TRAVEL HERE AND THAT'S GREATLY APPRECIATED AND WE GET THOSE RESULTS BACK WITHIN A FEW DAYS- NOW WHEN WE HAVE EIGHTY AT. OUT OF STATE PERSON THAT SUBMITS A HARD CARD THAT IS THEN MAILED IN THAT IS THEN SUBMITTED TO DOJ IT IS THAT PROCESS CLEAR DIRECTLY I AM THAT CAN TAKE UP DID YOU KNOW THREE MONTHS THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT THEY WANT IN DOT DOES WORK WITH US THEY TRY TO TURN THESE THINGS AROUND IN JUST A COUPLE WEEKS- IN ORDER FOR US TO EXPEDITE BACK WHAT WE DO IS RUN A REPORT. EACH MORNING AND AS SOON AS WE RECEIVE THAT ARE APPLICANTS HAVE A FINGERPRINT RESULTS BACK THOSE APPLICANTS ARE PULLED TO THE FRONT AND PROCESSED IMMEDIATELY SO WE PROCESS ALL OVER A TEMPORARY LICENSE REQUIREMENTS REQUEST- BASED ON FINGERPRINTS BACK. BECAUSE THAT'S USUALLY THE HOLD UP. I'M NOT GONNA BE. BELABOR THIS WITH QUESTIONS ON THAT WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE HAVE THE DISK- IN. IS LIVE SCANS STATE BY STATE OR IF I'M LIVE SCAN IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA AND HAVE A GEORGIA. LICENSE AS A REGISTERED NURSE- FROM TWO YEARS AGO THAT'S AN ACTIVE LICENSE MAY I AUTHORIZED THE STATE OF GEORGIA TO TRANSMIT MY FINGERPRINT CARD INFORMATION. TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITHOUT HAVING TO DO ANOTHER LIVE SCAN. IS THAT SOMETHING MS WELL BE THAT YOU'VE ENCOUNTERED. I HAVEN'T KEPT THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY ON THE DOJ WEBSITE WHERE THEY CAN ONLY DO CALIFORNIA LIKE SCANNED TO CALIFORNIA ENTITY- AND THEY STATE AS A STATUTORY REQUIREMENT NEXT TO IT I DON'T KNOW THAT NUMBER AT THE TOP OF MY HEAD BUT I CAN FIND THAT FOR YOU WELL THAT'S OKAY WE- WE HAVE SOME PLANS TO HAVE SOME CONVERSATIONS WITH A NEW ATTORNEY GENERAL ON THAT POINT. AND I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOUR INTEREST IN IN CHECKING AT TO TRY TO EXPEDITE THE FINGERPRINT PROCESS WHERE POSSIBLE SO WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO HELP YOU OUT A LITTLE BIT TO WHERE WE CAN. I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU MAYBE SEEING NO FURTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS LET'S MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PANEL IT'S THE OVERVIEW. OF NURSE LICENSURE COMPACTS TEMPORARY LICENSURE AND RECIPROCITY AND I'D LIKE TO WELCOME REBEKAH OF REBEKAH BLETSCH. THE DIRECTOR OF STATE ADVOCACY AND LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS AT THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF STATE BOARDS OF NURSING THEM I HOPE I PRONOUNCED YOUR NAME CORRECTLY WELCOME. HI THANK YOU YES WHAT TRENDS WITH SCRATCH. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE HERE TODAY- I AS AS YOU MENTIONED MY NAME'S RECORD BOTCHING THE DIRECTOR OF STATE ADVOCACY AND LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS AT AND C-SPAN- ARE AND YES BEYOND WHICH IS THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF STATE BOARDS OF NURSING IS A MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION- COMPRISED OF THE BOARD OF NURSING AND- EACH STATE- SO- ADLER TO HEAR ANY MENTION CALIFORNIA IS A MEMBER OF AND THAT'S THE END AND WE WORK WITH THEM. ROUTINELY I'M I AM HEARING AN ECHO ARE YOU HEARING AN ECHO ON YOUR END AS WELL. MAYBE IF YOU'VE TURNED YOUR OR YOU WANT ME TO ON YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM IN. I'M NOT SHOULD I BE YES MA'AM. ONCE WHAT THE SPEAKERS NOT YOURS NOT YOUR VOICE THE SPEAKER- AB WOULD YOU WANT TO HEAR YOU. YEAH I KNOW I SAID I WAS LIKE OH REALLY- I'M NOT SURE I DIDN'T THINK I WAS BUT I'LL TRY TO SPEAK SLOWLY IF THAT HELPS. SO I WANTED TO TAKE A MINUTE AND NOT TALK FIRST ABOUT THE NURSE LICENSURE COMPACT SO. THE NURSE LICENSURE COMPACT- WAS DRAFTED BY AND YES BEYOND SO AGAIN OUR OUR MEMBERS THE BOARDS OF NURSING. AND THE AND I'LL SEE BASICALLY ALLOWS OWNERS TO HAVE A LICENSE AND THE STATE THAT THEY RESIDE IN. AND THEN USE THAT LICENSE IN ANY OF THE OTHER STATES THAT HAVE ENACTED THE COMPACT- WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH ANY ADDITIONAL- APPLICATIONS OR- REGULATORY HURDLES IF YOU WELL. IT OPERATES VERY SIMILARLY TO ALTHOUGH VERY DIFFERENT OPERATIONALLY IT OPERATES SIMILAR TO BE AT. DRIVER'S LICENSE CONTACT. SO LIKE YOU CAN DRIVE ACROSS THE BORDER WITHOUT HAVING TO YOU KNOW NOTIFY LET'S SAY NEVADA THAT YOU'RE THERE OR HAVE A NEVADA DRIVER'S LICENSE- YOU'RE ABLE TO USE YOUR CALIFORNIA DRIVER'S LICENSE BECAUSE IT'S RECOGNIZED IN EACH OF THE STATES THAT I DON'T SEE IS. SIMILAR AND THAT WAY. THERE ARE CURRENTLY OUR THIRTY FIVE STATES AND JURISDICTIONS GUAM- DID ENACTED THIS YEAR SO NOW I HAVE TO GET USED I DID OR NOT EXCUSE ME STATE AND TERRITORY THAT TO GET USED TO SAYING STATES AND TERRITORIES AND NOT JUST STATE NOW- AND WE HAVE- ABOUT THREE STATES THAT WE ARE. CONFIDENT WILL BE PASSING- BEFORE THE SUMMER BEFORE THAT THEY GO ON THEIR SUMMER BREAK ON THE SESSION. SO IN THE- AND I DON'T THINK IT'S GROWING VERY MUCH- AND- I- WELL I COULD STOP THERE ON THE AND I'LL BE AND- ASK IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS OR IF THERE'S ANYTHING SPECIFICALLY THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF I TOUCHED UPON. I'M OR I CAN MOVE ON TO THE- TEMPORARY LICENSURE IN THE RECIPROCITY AS WELL FROM WHAT WE HAVE YOU FINISHED YOUR PREPARED- COMMENTS AND THEN- WILL OPEN IT UP TO QUESTIONS. SURE THEY'RE NOT OUR TEMPORARY LICENSURE WHICH I KNOW WAS DISCUSSED- A BIT BY THE CALIFORNIA BOARD- ABOUT 50% OF THE STATE'S OFFER- THE TEMPORARY LICENSE OR WHETHER THAT'S FOR- NEW APPLICATION SO LICENSURE BY EXAMINATION. OR HI LICENSURE BY ENDORSEMENT- AND IT TYPICALLY THAT TEMPORARY LICENSURE IS- IT'S PROVIDED ME WHILE YOU'RE THERE WAITING FOR A CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK FOR- AND CUT THE DAMS WORDS AGAIN AS WAS ALREADY MENTIONED. THERE ARE ALSO SOME TEMPORARY LICENSES ARE JUST KINDA LICENSE OR EXCEPTION- EXEMPTIONS THAT ARE IN STATUTES ACROSS THE COUNTRY FOR SPECIFIC ISSUES SO- DURING TIMES OF DISASTER- SOMETIMES- FOR INSTANCE IF RATE DURING CASE MANAGEMENT EFFORT NURSES FOLLOWING HER PATIENT ACROSS THE STATE LINE SHE WOULD BE. HAVING SOMETHING TO LIGHTEN- DURING THAT TIME- SO AGAIN MUCH MORE SPECIFIC ABOUT- AND THEN RECIPROCITY AND GENERAL. THERE ARE REALLY THE I CAN I CAN THINK OF ONE OUR RECIPROCITY AGREEMENT. IT'S BETWEEN MINNESOTA AND SOUTH DAKOTA THAT'S MORE REGIONAL BUT- THERE THE REALITY IS THAT MOST STATES DON'T HAVE- SMALLER REGIONAL LICENSURE- SURPRISE THE AGREEMENT SIGNED I THINK PROBABLY DUE TO THE COMPACT NOW THAT THE CONTACT HAS GROWN ACROSS THE COUNTRY- THE NEED FOR THOSE REGIONAL CONTRACTS JUST AREN'T THERE YOU KNOW QUITE AS MUCH. THERE IS A NEW. OUR PROPOSAL I NOT JUST PROPOSAL AND HAS BEEN ENACTED IN SOME STATES THAT IS. KIND OF THE- HERMAN THIS UNIVERSAL LICENSURE- IT WAS FIRST ENACTED IN ARIZONA AND WE HAVE SEEN IT- I BELIEVE MISSISSIPPI ADOPTED IT HAS BAD- FILE IS BUILDING MANY STATES OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS- IT'S DIFFERENT FROM THE COMPACT AND THAT TYPICALLY WELL FIRST OFF IT'S- THERE'S NO MODEL LANGUAGE EACH STATE IS DOING IT. WHO IN YOUR THAT ARE INTRODUCING BILLS ARE DOING IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY- I KNOW AT LEAST WITH ARIZONA'S WHICH WAS AGAIN THE FIRST AND FULLY FUNCTIONAL NOW- BEFORE THAT. WHAT UNIVERSE LIFE AND THE PEOPLE CAN BE ISSUED THEY THEY'RE STILL NEED TO BE A CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK DONE- AND THEY'RE STILL NEEDS TO HEAD THERE ARE STILL BEING- KIND OF REQUIREMENTS THAT NEED TO BE MACRO FOR THAT LICENSE CAN BE GRANTED SO. WELL IT'S A ONE WAY FOR- ARIZONA TO. HOW DO WE STREAMLINED SOME THINGS IT'S NOT GETTING PAST SOME OF THE BIGGEST HURDLES AS WERE ALREADY MENTIONED WHICH IS- THIS TIME CONSUMING CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS- AT THAT TRUST SO. AND THAT IS NOT AGAIN I KNOW THAT THAT HAS BEEN ENACTED IN ARIZONA I BELIEVE THERE MAY BE THREE OR FOUR STATES NOW BUT IT HAS NOT- NEED NOT IN THE MAJORITY OF STATES BY ANY MEANS. AND WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. COLLINGS ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMENTS OR CONCERNS ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG. THANK YOU CARE I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOUR PERSPECTIVE AND I WILL A LOT OF TO- AS THE FULL TRANSPARENCY I AM AN ADVOCATE FOR CALIFORNIA ENTER INTO THE NURSE LICENSURE COMPACT BUT% FROM YOUR NATIONAL PERSPECTIVE HOW IS THE NLC HELP CONTACT STATE. AND HOW COULD HELP CALIFORNIA DURING THE DURING THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC IN PARTICULARLY HE COULD ADDRESS HOW A RULE REGION'S OR RULES STATES HAVE ADDRESSED. SHORTAGE ISSUES THROUGH THE CONTACT. SURE SO EXTRA FIRST I'LL START WITH COALBED- AS I'M SURE YOU'RE WELL AWARE AB I BELIEVE EVERY STATE PASSWORD NOT COLORADO BUT ALMOST EVERY STATE'S GOVERNOR ISSUED SOME SORT OF A LICENSURE WAIVER OR EXEMPTION IN ORDER TO BRING HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS INTO THEIR STATE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND I'M REALLY WHAT THE IN THOSE STATES WERE DOING IS IMPLEMENTING THEIR OWN KIND OF FAST TRACK COMPACT BECAUSE IF YOU ARE A MEMBER OF THE CONTACT NURSES ARE READY ABLE TO COMMON PRACTICE IT IMMEDIATELY YOU DON'T NEED TO HAVE ANY SORT OF A LICENSURE EXEMPTION OR WAIT FOR THAT DISASTER DECLARATION. ONE OF THE REASON THE I'LL BE REALLY HELPED THOSE STATE DURING COLD READ IS THAT. IT WILL WORK NUMBER ONE ONE OF THE BIG GRIEVANCES THERE WAS NO WAITING SO. EVEN THOUGH ULTIMATELY ALL OF THE GOVERNOR DID ISSUE THOSE LICENSURE EXAMINATIONS IT WASN'T IMMEDIATE- THERE WERE SURGES AT DIFFERENT TIMES AND GOVERNOR'S TOOK ACTIONS AT DIFFERENT TIMES SO. IT WASN'T AS THOUGH YOU KNOW- IMMEDIATELY WHEN THE FIRST COALBED. CASE HENCE. THE LICENSES WERE IN A LIFE CHANGER WITH EXAM TODAY IT TOOK A LITTLE BIT OF TIME. AND THEN ALONG THOSE SAME LINES THOSE LICENSURE. EXECUTIVE ORDERS AS EXTENSION NEEDED TO BE- RENEWED IF YOU WELL MOST OF THOSE EXECUTIVE ORDERS LASTED FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY. AND THEN THEY WOULD BE EXTENDED HOWEVER THE NURSES WHO ARE PRACTICING UNDER THOSE LICENSE OR EXEMPTIONS DIDN'T. KNOW FOR SURE WINNER IF THOSE. EXEMPTION WOULD BE EXTRA. OFTENTIMES I KNOW THAT THIS IS JUST AN EXAMPLE FROM NEW YORK BUT THERE WERE NURSES AND HOSPITAL THAT WE'RE FINDING OUT THE DAY BEFORE. THAT THE THOSE EXEMPTIONS WOULD BE EXPECT EXTENDED AND THEREFORE THEY COULD KEEP TREATING PATIENTS ADMITTED IT WAS JUST A VERY. STRESSFUL TIME ON TOP OF AN EXTREMELY STRESSFUL TIME DURING THE PANDEMIC- SO THAT STABILITY WITH THEIR- THE OTHER REALLY IMPORTANT THING TO HIGHLIGHT ABOUT THE COMPACT IS THAT THERE IS A REQUIREMENT OF CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK REQUIREMENTS. SO WHEN CONTRACTORS HAS COME TO PRACTICE IN YOUR STATE THEY ARE ABLE TO IMMEDIATELY PRACTICE AND YOU KNOW THAT THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN CRIMINAL BACK CRIMINALLY BACKGROUND CHECKS BECAUSE THEY HAD TO DO THAT. IN ORDER TO ATTAIN THEIR COMPACT LICENSE. SO DURING THE PANDEMIC WHEN THE GOVERNOR'S DID EXEMPTS LICENSURE. THEY YOU KNOW THERE WAS NO TIME TO DO CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS OF COURSE SO. I DON'T MEAN TO NECESSARILY IMPLIES THAT. A LOT OF THE NURSES CROSSING STATE LINES WERE DOING ANYTHING CRIMINAL OR WORK ANY KIND OF BAD ACTORS BUT YOU KNOW AS YOU KNOW IT IT DOES HAPPEN. RIGHT AND THIS IS ONE KIND OF WAY TO MAINTAIN THAT PUBLIC PROTECTION- BY. KNOWING THAT THE CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS HAVE BEEN DONE IN THOSE NURSES DO NOT HAVE A CRIMINAL PAST. BUT WE GOT HE SAID THAT SO THE NLC. PROVIDES SOME CERTAINTY AND STABILITY- BUT MY SECOND QUESTION IS THE B. R. AND HAS CITED CONTINUING EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS AS A REASON FOR WHY. CALIFORNIA MAY NOT BE FIT FOR PARTICIPATING IN THE CONTACT. IN YOUR OPINION HAVE DISCREPANCIES IN CONTINUING EDUCATION LEAD TO ANY. PROBLEMS OR ISSUES- WITH ANY PARTICIPATING STATE. NOW IT HASN'T- IT HASN'T AND IT YOU KNOW WITH THIRTY FOUR STATES AND TERRITORIES PARTICIPATING NOW THEY THE C. E. REDACTING EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIED ACROSS THOSE STATES- I THINK ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS WHY THIS HASN'T BECOME AN ISSUE IS THAT TYPICALLY EMPLOYERS REQUIRE TEACHING EDUCATION AND PACKAGING EDUCATION AS MUCH MORE SPECIFIC TO- THAT NURSE'S EMPLOYMENT AND YOU KNOW WHAT HERE SHE IS DOING ON A DAILY BASIS SO. I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE REASON IT'S NOT AS IF THE STATE DOESN'T REQUIRE SEED IT'S NOT AS IF THE NURSES ARE DOING SEE IT'S JUST THAT IT'S NOT REQUIRED. BY THE BOARD OF NURSING FOR RIGHT NOW ALL- OKAY I GOT THAT AND THAT THAT CERTAINLY- A VERY INTERESTING POINT AND WHAT NOTING- IN TERMS OF- I CERTAINLY OF AN I'M MORE OF A NATIONAL EXPERIENCE BUT CERTAINLY FOR I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN CALIFORNIA OR OTHER REAL REGIONS- WE HAVE- CHALLENGES AND STAFFING. AND I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE OF OTHER PARTS OF THE UNITED STATES TO HAVE SIMILAR- CHALLENGES. HOW HAS THE NLC BENEFITTED RULE REGIONS- AND THEN. IS THERE A IS THERE TIED TO- TELEHEALTH AND WOULD BE IN ENTERING INTO AN L. AND L. C. INTO THEM AS A CONTACT. HAS IT HELPED EXPAND TELEHEALTH AND IN THE COMPACT STATE. YEAH ONE OF THE BIG WAYS THAT IT HELPS IN RURAL AREAS IT'S FILLING- GAPS IN CARE SO FOR YOU KNOW THERE IS A WIDE NURSING SHORTAGE OF GENERAL NURSING SHORTAGE THAT. A LOT OF AREAS AND A LOT OF STATES ARE EXPERIENCING. BUT SOME OF THE MOST- URGENT NEED IS WITH SPECIALTY NURSES SO WHEN I SEE YOU NURSES AS EASY NURSES- IT IT'S NURSES THAT HAVE THESE THE SPECIALTY TRAINING AND YOU CANNOT JUST HOSPITAL CAN'T RECRUIT. ANY ARE AND TO FILL THOSE SPOTS. SO WE'VE SEEN ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS THAT MAY HAVE A HARDER TIME RECRUITING IS SPECIALTY NURSES WITH THE I DON'T SEE IS EXTREMELY HELPFUL- HELPING- HEALTHCARE INSTITUTIONS IN THAT AREA GREEN AND TRAVEL TEMPORARY ITS SPECIALTY NURSES. TO KIND OF FILL THOSE GAPS AND KERR. AS FAR AS TELEHEALTH- IT HELLO HOW HAS BEEN EXPANDING NOW FOR YEARS BUT THE PANDEMIC HAS REALLY. REALLY- MADE A LOT OF OUR LOT OF CONSUMERS BECOME MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE WITH TELEHEALTH BECAUSE THEY'VE THEY'VE USED IT OVER THE LAST YEAR THEY'VE BEEN FORCED TO AND REALIZE THAT THIS IS- WELL I DON'T KNOW SOME MAY HAVE REALIZED THAT THIS IS A GREAT JANET PARTICULARLY FOR RURAL AREAS. SO I THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO ONLY SEE MORE EXPANSION I KNOW THAT ACROSS THE COUNTRY THEY'RE BAD MORE AND MORE LAWS- TO EXPAND THE TELEHEALTH ITS COVERAGES REIMBURSEMENT. AND THE COMPACT FACILITATE THAT IN THE SENSE THAT A NURSE COULD BE IN ONE STATE TO THE OWNERS CAN BE IN CALIFORNIA. BUT COULD BE PRACTICING ON TELEHEALTH ON PATIENTS- IN ANY CONTEXT STATE ACROSS THE COUNTRY SO A IN ONE WITH HER ONE LICENSE WHEREAS RIGHT NOW IF THAT NURSE WANTED TO PRACTICE TELEHEALTH IN. FIVE DIFFERENT STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY HE WOULD NEED TO BE LICENSED AND- HEY LOOK LICENSE OR FEES FOR NEW THE LICENSE AND THOSE FIVE STATES. SO- SO I A I JUST WANTED TO DIVE A LITTLE DEEPER EASY SPECIALTY NURSES AND WE AS IT WAS EVERYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY BUT A LOT OF US IN CALIFORNIA UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF AN ICU NURSE. WHICH IS VERY DISTINCT FROM ANOTHER NURSING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PANDEMIC THAT WAS KIND OF WHAT WAS DRIVING A LOT OF OUR STAFFING CAPACITIES. SO WHEN YOU SAY SPECIALLY ORDERED NURSES ICU NURSES ARE INCLUDED IN THAT CORRECT. CRACKED AND ICY YOU EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT NURSES- OBGYN NURSES YEAH. PERFECT I THINK THAT'S THE ONE OF THE I GUESS TO ME IS A COMPELLING REASON FOR CALIFORNIA TO ENTER INTO THE CONTRACT IS THAT WELL WHEN WE NEED THOSE THOSE SPECIALTY NURSES ESPECIALLY IN THE RURAL REGIONS AND WE CAN'T HAVE THEM MAKING IT EASIER FOR NURSES TO COME INTO OUR REGION TO PROVIDE THAT CRITICAL. SAFETY NET AND HEALTHCARE ACCESS IS- ESSENTIAL AND THEN MY LAST QUESTION IS IN A TIGHT TO THE POINT WHERE THE NLC HELP UNDERSERVED HOSPITALS MAINTAIN A STABLE SUPPLY OF NURSES IN THEIR FACILITIES IN A MORE COST EFFECTIVE MATTER IN YOUR OPINION. YEAH AND IN MY OPINION YES BECAUSE AGAIN THERE'S JUST NO.WAITING PERIOD TO BRING NURSES AND- SO I THINK THAT IS WHERE. THE EXACT KIND OF STABILITY KNOWING THAT YOU WILL YOU HAVE A POOL OF NURSES THAT CAN BE USED- IT IS HELPFUL FOR. EMPLOYERS AND- IT REDUCES LICENSURE FEES FOR NURSES AS AS WELL AS FOR EMPLOYERS OF EMPLOYERS ARE PAYING. TRIBUTE GREAT THE AND THEN I AM JUST A CIRCLE BACK AND I APPRECIATE THE PATIENCE OF THE CHAIR AND IN BACK TO THE DISCREPANCIES AND CONTINUED EDUCATION AND PROBABLY ONE OF THE REASONS WHY. MANY WOULD ARGUE CALIFORNIA ISN'T FIT FOR PARTICIPATING AS YOU MENTIONED. AS EMPLOYERS REQUIRE THEIR OWN CD THERE ISN'T HAVE YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANY PATIENT SAFETY ISSUES. WITH WITHIN THE CONTACT STATE DUE TO THE TO THE LC. NO NO WE HAVE AN NORGES IN REGARDS TO A CONTENDING EDUCATION PERIOD WE HAVEN'T SEEN PATIENT SAFETY ISSUES. GREAT SO I BY APPRECIATE THAT- ESPECIALLY ACTIVITIES I THINK YOU MAKE A COMPELLING ARGUMENT I CALIFORNIA SHOULD ENTERTAIN ENTERING INTO THE L. C. AND I HOPE MY COLLEAGUES WHICH WOULD WOULD ALSO FIND ARGUMENTS COMPELLING AS WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU A MEMBER FONG ASSEMBLY. THANK YOU MISTER CARE GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE WITH US TODAY I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS- REGARDING THE J. LACK AUDIT AND THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS. WHAT IS THE STATUS OF THE STATUS OF THE G. LACK RECOMMENDATIONS AND ARE ADDITIONAL STATUTORY CHANGES NEEDED. ALSO HOW DOES THE B. R. IN NOTIFY SCHOOLS THAT ARE WEEK THAT WE'RE GOING TO LIMIT OR STOP THEIR ABILITY TO ENROLL STUDENTS. WHAT OPTIONS TO THE SCHOOLS HAVE FOR APPEALS AND IS LIMITING ENROLLMENT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON THE STUDENT CURRENTLY ATTENDING THAT SCHOOL. FOR LET SOME IF- MISS MEL B. IS STILL ON THE- VIDEO MAYBE- WILL TAKE JUST THE DON'T GO ANYWHERE MEMOS NEED TO ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS IN A BIT BUT MAYBE WE CAN ASK MS MEL B. TO RESPOND TO THOSE QUESTIONS ON THE ORDER OF THE BOARD. I'M SORRY MR CHAIRED AYE LEN AT THE WRONG JOKER THAT'S FINE WE CAN WE'RE ALL OF THIS IS ONE BIG. HAPPY FAMILY YEARS SO YOU BEST CAN MOVE UP AS MEL. B. TRY TO ANSWER THEM THANK YOU. I WILL I'LL TRY TO ANSWER- I JUST WANT CLARIFICATION THE FIRST ONE IS YOU WANTED TO KNOW WHAT WAS ON THE G. LACK AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS WHERE WE WERE ON THAT IS THAT CORRECT. CORRECT AND THEN- WHAT HOW WE NOTIFIED THE SCHOOLS THAT WERE GONNA LIMIT OR STOP IN MOMENTS CORRECT. AND THEN YOU ASKED ABOUT AN APPEAL PROCESS IS THAT CORRECT THAT IS CORRECT. THEY THEY MISSED ANYTHING ABOUT ONE LAST ONE DOES LIMITING ENROLLMENT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON THE STUDENT WHO IS CURRENTLY ATTENDING. THAT SCHOOL. OKAY I WILL ANSWER ALL FOR THOSE THANK- A GROUP BE A ROLE MEANT ONCE TOGETHER FIRST AND THEN I'LL GOING TO THE GYM LACK ONE WHICH IS. OVERSEES ALL OF THAT SO LIMITING ENROLLMENT ON THE CURRENT ISSUE STUDENTS HAS ONE EFFECT- IF WE LIMIT IN ROMANCE OR I WOULD WANT TO SEE LIVING COSTS IF WE- MONITORING ROLEX OF THE OTHER SCHOOLS IN THAT REGION. IT HELPS ENSURE THAT THAT STUDENT WHO IS ALREADY ENROLLED CAN COMPLETE THEIR EDUCATION PROCESS AND COMPLETE THE CLINICAL REQUIREMENTS OF THAT EDUCATION PROCESS IT HAS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON THAT STUDENTS. THAT IS CURRENTLY ENROLLED IT DOES NOT HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT. THE NEXT QUESTION IS HOW DO WE NOTIFY OUR SCHOOLS IF WE'RE GOING TO LIMIT OR STOP ENROLLMENT. WHEN A SCHOOL HAS A COMPUTING APPROVAL VISIT WHERE WE GO OUT AS THE NEC'S AND THEY VERIFIED THAT THE SCHOOL IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL RULES AND REGULATIONS- THAT INFORMATION IS BROUGHT TO THE BOARD. IF THERE IS ANY TIME THAT THERE IS A NON COMPLIANCE WITH THE REGULATION THAT IS BROUGHT FORTH TO THE BOARD IF IT IS EGREGIOUS THE BOARD CAN MAKE A DECISION TO DO TWO THINGS. THE ONE THING THAT THEY CAN MAKE THE DECISION IF THEY'RE NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE RULES AND REGULATIONS TO DEFERRING ACTION- BETTER- AG COMMON- STAG DECISION THE BOARD MEMBERS MAKE. IS DEFERRING ACTION AND THAT ALLOWS THE SCHOOL TIME TO BRING THEMSELVES BACK INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THAT REGULATION IT DOES NOT AFFECT ENROLLMENT. AND IT DOES NOT AFFECT- THE CONTINUATION OF THAT SCHOOL. IF THE BOARD SEES THAT THERE IS SOMETHING THAT IS ANGRY JESS IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON WHERE THEY HAVE TO STEP IN IS THERE A MATTER OF PUBLIC PROTECTION BIG COULD VOTE. TO- PUT THE SCHOOL ON A WARNING STATUS AS PART OF THAT MORNING STATUS THEY HAVE CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS THEY PUT OUT TO THE SCHOOL THEY CAN REQUIRE. TO HALT ENROLLMENTS BACON REQUIRED TO DECREASE THE ENROLLMENT NUMBERS OR THEY CAN DO NOTHING ABOUT ENROLLMENT AND REQUIRE THEM TO COME IN AND JUST CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE NEC AND PROVIDE PROGRESS REPORTS TO. THE SCHOOL AND THEN GIVE THEM A TIMELINE OF WHEN THEY HAVE THIS COMPLETED BY- THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS AND THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT THAT IS COMMUNICATED IS THROUGH A BOARD VOTE IT HAS TO BE UNANIMOUS VOTE. AND THEN A BOARD ACTION LETTER IS- SENT OUT THAT DISCUSSES THAT BOAT IN THAT IS NOTIFIED TO THE SCHOOLS. THE SCHOOLS ARE PRESENT DURING ALL OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS- AND TYPICALLY IT'S NOT JUST THE DEAN OR DIRECTOR OF ITS OVER THE NURSING PROGRAM BUT THAT PRESIDENT VICE PRESIDENT- SOMETIMES- THE CHANCE OR WHATEVER WILL SHOW UP AT THOSE MEETINGS. AND- PROVIDE INPUT AS WELL. I'M THE NEXT QUESTION WHY DO WE HAVE AN APPEAL PROCESS. WE DO NOT HAVE AN OFFICIAL APPEAL PROCESS. BUT WHAT WE DO HAVE IS THAT EVERY EDUCATION LICENSE COMMITTEE EVERY BOARD MEETING THAT NURSING PROGRAM CAN ASK THEIR NURSING EDUCATION CONSULTANT TO BRING THEM FOR TO THE BOARD- WE DO HAVE A SCHOOL RIGHT NOW THAT'S ON WARNING STATUS THEY DID JUST HAVE THEIR ENROLLMENT- NUMBERS AFFECTED- AND- THEY WILL BE COMING BACK. TO THE NEXT EDUCATION LICENSE COMMITTEE MEETING WHICH IS HELD IN- JUNE. AND THEY WILL COME BACK TO THE NEXT BOARD MEETING IN AUGUST- SO THAT THEY CAN SHOW WHERE THEY'RE AT AND POTENTIALLY GET CHANGES- MADE- BUT THATIS SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN DO. WITHOUT AN APPEAL PROCESS THEY CAN COME TO ANY E. L. C. IN ANY BOARD MEETING AND REQUEST TO BE REEVALUATED ANYTIME SO THERE'S NO OFFICIAL PROCESS NEEDED WE HAVE THAT PROCESS OF COMMUNICATION AND REQUEST. ALREADY VETTED INTO OUR CURRENT PROCESSES. THE. LAST ONE IS THE G. LIKE AUDIT. THE G. LIKE AUDIT GAVE NOT RECORD. FIVE OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE FULLY IMPLEMENTED THERE ARE FOR THAT ARE PENDING THOSE FOUR ARE INTERRELATED- AND THAT IS WHERE WE HAVE TO CREATE A DATA BANK- THAT REQUIRES- SORRY COLLECTS ALL OF THE CLINICAL PLACEMENT DATA THAT OUR SCHOOLS ARE USING- IT AND PUT THAT DATA BANK INTO SOME KIND OF FORMAT THAT CAN BE SHARED ON OUR WEBSITE. AND THEN OBVIOUSLY- THAT DATA TO AUSTIN YEAH. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF THAT WE'VE COLLECTED ALL OF THE UPDATED FORMS FROM OUR SCHOOLS WE ARE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE AND PULL THE DATA FROM OSPINA- WE HAVE GONE THROUGH THE TESTING ENVIRONMENTS AND IT SHOULD BE READY TO INPUT DATA AS SOON AS NEXT WEEK- AND SO WE WILL HAVE THAT OUT ONTO OUR WEBSITE- BY THE OCTOBER DEADLINE. THAT IS OUR GOAL. AND THEN THAT SHOULD CLEAR UP THOSE FOUR REMAINING- REQUIREMENTS REQUEST THAT THEY HAVE BECAUSE- THEY'RE ALL INTERRELATED AND BASED ON THAT DATA BANK BE PUBLISHED. THANK YOU A COUPLE QUICK FOLLOW UPS MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU. SO ON THE DECREASE IN ENROLLMENT IF THE BOARD VOTES TO DECREASE THE ENROLLMENT THAT WOULD BE FUTURE STUDENTS NOT CONSIDER CURRENTLY ATTENDING. YES THAT'S CORRECT OKAY AND SINCE THERE IS NO OFFICIAL APPEAL PROCESS DOES EVERY SCHOOL KNOW THAT THEY CAN COME AND BE RE EVALUATED. YES AND THEY ARE ANY SEIZE COMMUNICATE WITH THAT ALREADY SEES OUR SITE EACH SCHOOL ONE ON ONE. AND I MEET WITH MY THE NEC'S ON A WEEKLY BASIS AND WILL GO OVER ANY OF THESE DISCUSSIONS AND THEN THEY CAN BRING THAT INFORMATION BACK TO THE DEANS AND DIRECTORS THE DEANS AND DIRECTORS ARE ALSO. AVAILABLE TO YOU- COULD JUST BEAT ANY OF OUR COMMITTEE MEETINGS AND THEY HAVE WHAT WE CALL A DIRECTOR'S HANDBOOK- IN THAT DIRECTORS YOU CAN BOOK ALSO TALKS ABOUT HOW YOU CAN REQUEST YOU TO. GET FROM THERE AND YOU SEE. TO ANY PART OF THEIR SCHOOL. THE HELPFUL ONE MY QUESTION IN THE AUDIT THERE WERE SOME SERVICES THAT WERE CONSIDERED DUPLICATIVE. AND CAN ANY OF THESE DUPLICATIVE SERVICES BE REDUCED. YES YEAH- THE ONE THING THAT IT TALKED ABOUT WAS LOOKING AT ACCREDITATION VERSES APPROVAL- NCSP AND IS ON THE LINE THIS IS THE PANEL SAYS SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO ANSWER THIS- BUT NCSP AND REQUIRES ALL OF THE SCHOOLS STUDENTS THAT WILL SIT FOR THE ENTRANCE EXAM TO COME FROM ABORTED HER SCHOOL. SO THE APPROVAL PROCESS HAS TO REMAIN BUT WE NEED TO SEE HOW COME. WORK BETTER WITH ARE CREDITING THE CHECK OFF- BODIES AND SO THERE'S TWO MAIN ACCREDITING BODIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S THE A. C. E. N. M. C. C. M. E. AND ABOUT 50% OF OUR SCHOOLS HAVE THAT ACCREDITATION- THE OTHER THOSE THAT ARE ACCREDITED RBS AND PROGRAMS AND NOT OUR ATM PROGRAMS- BUT IN THAT PROCESS. BE HAVE- EIGHT CONTINUING APPROVAL. I HAVE ESTABLISHED A WORKGROUP WITH FOUR DEANS AND-DIRECTORS AND MYSELF AND MY CHIEF OF LICENSING WHO OVERSEES OUR NEC'S. AND WHAT WE'VE DONE IS MET EVERY OTHER WEEK AND WE'RE DOING OUR VERY FIRST COMBINE B. R. IN APPROVAL AND ACCREDITATION VISIT THIS FALL I BELIEVE IS SCHEDULED FOR AUGUST AND IT WILL BE AT SAN DIEGO CITY SCHOOL ALL THE COLLEGES DOWN IN SAN DIEGO CALIFORNIA. AND SO WE'LL SEE HOW THIS GOES WE WILL SUBMIT ONE REPORT IT WILL NOT BE A DUPLICATED PRODUCT REPORT TO CATCH YOU COULD BE OUR AND- IN ANY ITEMS THAT THAT DOESN'T ANSWER WITHIN THEIR CREDIT D. SAN REPORTS- BILL HAVE EIGHTY ADDENDUM THAT THEY WILL USE TO ANSWER B. R. AT. AS WELL ON THE NCSP AND WEBSITE THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION ON HOW TO CONDUCT THESE VISITS IN A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY- AND WHO FOCUSES ON WHAT AND WHICH ONE AND WE HAVE THAT UP I HAVE THAT TOOL BOX AND I AM UTILIZING IT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ARE DUE TO DIRECTORS COMPLAIN ABOUT IS ON THE FACULTY APPROVAL AND SO LIKE I SAID WHEN I LOOKED WORKING ON GETTING BACK DATABASE HOW IS IT WOULD REQUIRE A ONE TIME FACULTY APPROVAL VERY MUCH LIKE A TEACHING CREDENTIAL- AND WITH THAT TEACHING CREDENTIAL YOU CAN KIND OF GO ANYWHERE YOU WANT YOU DON'T NEED TO BE RE APPROVED FREE SCHOOL. AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE PLAN TO DO WITH THE B. R. READ IS TO PROVE THE FACULTY MEMBER ONCE I'VE BEEN OUR DATA BANK AND ESSENTIALLY THEY WOULD HAVE A TEACHING CREDENTIAL TO TEACH NURSING- AND THAT CAN GO FROM SCHOOL TO SCHOOL NOT REQUIRE RE APPROVAL WOULD JUST BE THE INITIAL APPROVAL. AND IT'S JUST LIKE A TEACHING CREDENTIAL. THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE A SINGLE SUBJECT TEACHING CREDENTIAL OR MULTIPLE SUBJECT TEACHING CREDENTIAL THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD DO IS THE BOARD TO IS WE HAVE FIVE SPECIALTY AREAS OF NURSING. AND IF YOU WANT TO TEACH IN MORE THAN ONE IN VERSUS A SINGLE SUBJECT FOR SOME MULTI SUBJECT TEACHING CREDENTIAL WE CAN APPROVE IT FOR MULTIPLE AREAS HAVE THAT ON OUR WEBSITE THAT YOU GUYS CAN ACCESS AND. IT WOULD BE VERY MUCH LIKE GETTING A TEACHING CREDENTIAL WITH THE SINGLE. OR MULTIPLE SUBJECT. SO WE'LL FOLLOW SUIT WITH THE EDUCATION. WITH WILL BE THANK YOU SO MUCH-YOUR THREE AND THOROUGH AND OF THE IT THAT MUCH APPRECIATED MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU AND- AS WELL WE THANK YOU FOR A FEELING OF FLYBALLS- LET'S RETURN TO- NURSE LICENSURE COMPACT SO LET ME JUST ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS UNLESS I WILL I WILL POINT OUT TO MY COLLEAGUES REMEMBER WE HAVE THREE MORE PANELS. PLUS PUBLIC COMMENT WE ARE HAVE WE HAVE NO IT OF NEXT WE HAVE NURSING WORKFORCE SUPPLY FOR THE OF YOU WHO HAVEN'T SEEN THE AND WE HAVE AT PLACED SO- WE MAY WANT TO SORT OF SLIDE OR CLOSE IN WITH THE PANELS IS THE- AS- APPEAR PROPRIA. WITH CHRIS TO NURSE LICENSURE. AS FAR HOPE YOU'RE STILL THERE. I AM. LET ME JUST ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS THAT WITH THE. NURSING LICENSE COMPACTS WHILE. IF. IS THAT IS THAT IN FACT A RESTRICTION AND IF SO IS THE RESTRICTION THAT CAN BE ADJUSTED. YES THAT IS THAT IS A REQUIREMENT THERE ARE A LOT OF IN LICENSURE REQUIREMENTS THAT A NURSE MUST MEET BEFORE SHE COULD BE ISSUED. A COMPACT LICENSE AND THAT WOULD BE IN ADDITION TO WHATEVER IS REQUIRED FROM THE STATE THAT SHE'S APPLYING FOR LICENSURE AND- ONE OF WHICH IS A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER AND- UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE MOST OF THE THINGS NOT EVERYTHING BUT MOST OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE COMPACT- CANNOT BE CHANGE. BECAUSE THAT CONTACTED US ESSENTIALLY A CONTRACT THAT ALL THE STATES ARE JOINING TOGETHER. SO STATES CAN UNILATERALLY DECIDE WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO KIND OF TAKE OUT AND YOU KNOW OR ADD AN ADDITIONAL BECAUSE EVERYONE HAS TO BE OPERATING UNDER THE SAME RULES. I'M SO FOR IT SO SINCE THE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER REQUIREMENT IS IN SPECIFICALLY IN THE STATUTE- THAT WOULD NOT BE SOMETHING THAT COULD BE CHANGED TO UNILATERALLY BY CALIFORNIA. ONE OF THE THINGS CERTAINLY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT AROUND HERE IS. WHAT ASPECT OF OUR POPULATION OF THE NURSES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ARE OPERATING WITH AYE TENS AS OPPOSED TO SOMETHING ELSE TO DETERMINE- WHAT PORTION OF OUR NURSE POPULATION WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PARTICIPATE IN THIS NURSE COMPACT. AS OPPOSED TO THE POPULATION PERCENTAGE THAT WILL NOT LET ME ASK ANOTHER QUESTION I WANT TO MAKE SURE I'M CLEAR ON THIS THE BACKGROUND PAPER THAT WE WERE PROVIDED. CONTAINS A STATEMENT THAT THE MULTI STATE LICENSES ISSUED IN THE STATE WHERE THE REGISTERED NURSE OR LICENSED VOCATIONAL NURSE LEGAL GROUP LEGALLY RESIDES NOT IN THE STATE WHERE THEY WANT TO PRACTICE. SO FOR EXAMPLE- UNDER THE NURSE COMPACT- A- WHITENERS LICENSED IN THE STATE OF NEVADA WOULD HAVE A MULTI STATE LICENSE AND COULD COME TO CALIFORNIA TO PERFORM WORK. ORDER FOR A NURSE INSTEAD OF COMING TO CALIFORNIA TO PERFORM WORK FOR THREE MONTHS OR FOUR MONTHS OR FIVE MONTHS ON ACCOUNT OF A NATURAL DISASTER OR SOME OTHER I WORKFORCE NEED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE NURSE DECIDED THAT DECIDES TO MOVE HIS HER OR THEIR FAMILY- TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WOULD THAT REQUIRE THEN THAT NURSE TO OBTAIN LICENSURE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA UNDER THE NURSE COMPACT. YEAH CORRECT WIDE. AGAIN SIMILAR TO WHEN YOU CHANGE YOUR RESIDENCE AND YOU MOVE TO A NEW STATE YOU NEED A NEW DRIVERS LICENSE. IT'S THAT SAME PRINCIPLE- SO. YOU CAN CONTINUE PRACTICING UNDER YOUR CONTACT LICENSES WHILE YOU APPLY AND GET THAT NEW STATE ISSUED LICENSE BECAUSE YOU KNOW UNDER YOUR- OUR PREVIOUS LICENSE YOU HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF PRACTICE CONTINUE PRACTICING IN CALIFORNIA BUT THE- YOU MIGHT YES YOU MUST APPLY AND GET A NEW LICENSE AND- THAT'S WHERE YOU NOW RESIDE. SO IT WOULD EASE THE PROCESS AND THAT THE NURSE COULD CONTINUE TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE SERVICES AS THE CALIFORNIA LICENSING PROCESS- TAKES ITS COURSE. CORRECT AND FOR THOSE SO I KNOW THE MILITARY COMMUNITY IS VERY- ANXIOUS TO SEE CALIFORNIA EXPLORE THIS NURSE COMPACT- ISSUE FOR THOSE- NURSES THEY THEIR LEGAL RESIDENCE DOESN'T CHANGE IF THEY MOVE FROM SIDE TO SIDE FROM STATE TO STATE PURSUANT TO MILITARY ORDERS SO THE NURSE CONTACT WOULD PROVIDE A CONTINUING AUTHORIZATION TO PERFORM NURSING SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA DURING THE PERIOD OF TIME THAT THE- I PRESUME THE NURSE OR THE FILES OF THE NURSES ASSIGNED HERE. THAT THAT IS CORRECT. AFTER. OKAY MEMBERS ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS. I SEE NONE MISFORTUNE THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH FOR YOUR THOROUGH RESPONSES. THANK YOU OUR NEXT PANEL WILL FOCUS ON NURSING EDUCATION APPROVAL WE WILL HEAR FROM CAN MARLBORO VICE PRESIDENT FOR THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING AND MISS MEL B. RETURNS TO US AND AGAIN MISS FUTCH YOU'RE GOING TO BE HERE WITH US THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF STATE BOARDS OF NURSING. PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD AFTERNOON IT'S A GOOD TO BE HERE. BOB FINALLY WHAT HE WAS DOING IT MARLBORO AND I WAS APPOINTED TO THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING BY THE SENATE RULES COMMITTEE AS A PUBLIC MEMBER BACK IN APRIL OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. I WAS ALSO ELECTED A VICE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD IN JUNE OF THIS PAST JUNE- AND I CURRENTLY SERVE WHEN YOU EDUCATION AND LICENSED COMMITTEE AND I'M HONORED TO BE HERE TOO. SO I HAVE A LITTLE BIT INFORMATION OF SHORT BACKGROUND ABOUT WHAT THE EDUCATION LICENSE COMMITTEE DOES SOME OF HIS INFORMATION HAS ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED BECAUSE OF THE. YES QUESTIONS TO. BUT I'LL TRY TO GO THROUGH THIS FOR QUICKLY. SAUDITA LAST COMMITTEE THE L. C. S. WE CALL IT IS A NON STATUTORY COMMITTEE WHICH THE ADVISES THE BOARD ON MATTERS RELATED TO NURSING EDUCATION. APPROVAL OF PRE LICENSURE PROGRAMS. ADVANCE PRACTICE NURSING PROGRAMS THE NATIONAL COUNCIL LICENSURE EXAMINATION OF REGISTERED NURSES NO ONE ELSE CAN COLLAPSE. ANY AND ALL SCHOOL STATE ANNUAL SCHOOL SURVEY DATA AND REPORTS ALSO LICENSE UNIT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND OF COURSE CONTINUING EDUCATION. THERE'S THREE TYPES OF PRE LICENSURE NURSING PROGRAM. THE ASSOCIATE DEGREE PROGRAMS AND A BACCALAUREATE DEGREE PROGRAMS AND ALSO ENTRY LEVEL MASTER'S DEGREE PROGRAMS CURRENTLY IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE NINETY ONE ASSOCIATE DEGREE PROGRAMS AND FORTY SIX. BACCALAUREATE DEGREE PROGRAMS AND TWELVE ENTRY LEVEL MASTER'S DEGREE PROGRAMS THAT YOU CAN FIND ALL THAT INFORMATION ON OUR WEBSITE AS WELL. SO JUST A LITTLE BACKGROUND ON HOW BILLS OF PEOPLE'S FREE LICENSE PROCESS WORK FIRST AND FOREMOST A PRE LICENSURE NURSING PROGRAM WAS FIRST. LETTER OKAY. AND THEN THE REQUIRED SPEED TO THE B. R. YEAH. THE NEXT STEP IS FOR LOCALS PRE LICENSURE NURSING PROGRAM TO COMPETE A FEASIBILITY STUDY WHICH MARKS MUST BE APPROVED. BY THE BOARD OVERALL. THE FEASIBILITY STUDY DOCUMENTS THE NEED FOR THE PROGRAM AND THE PROGRAM APPLICANTS BILITY TO DEVELOP IMPLEMENT SUSTAIN. A VIABLE LICENSORS REGISTERED NURSING PROGRAM. IT JUST SOME FACTS ON THAT YEAH THIS YEAR WE SAW CRAB ACCEPTED BY. THE STUDY'S BEEN TWENTY TWENTY THREE ACCEPTED TO AND TWENTY NINETEEN WEEK. SEPARATELY WAS WELL. SO NEXT STEP IS APPROVAL. USED IN THE APPROVAL. IS THAT THIS. BUT TO BE OUR IN SELF STUDY. I KNOW AND COMES KNOWN AS UNIONS ARE ANY C. WORK FOR TO BE INTERESTS FIVE IS THE LATEST ON WITH THE BOARD AND THE FOOTBALL THREE LICENSE OR NURSING. ONE DID YOU SEE VERY THE SELF STATUS. ADDRESSES THAT THAT IS NOT A STARK ADDRESS. RULES AND- IN THE STATE THEN PER THE- PROGRAM TO EAGLE SPEAKER. ADD TO THE BOOK OF THE B. BOARD MEETING. BOB SO- THE BOARD GRAN- OF NEW LICENSE PROGRAMS TO START I'M SORRY I MISSED WHEN THE STATE THAT. SO WE WOULD HAVE YEAH WE HAVE A STUDENTS ON BOARD IT'S IN THE WEBSITE AS WELL BUT I ALSO WANT TO LET YOU KNOW WE ALSO DO- IN ROME INCREASES SO JUST TO GIVE YOU SOME FACTS WE HAVE INCREASED IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. SEVENTY ROLE IN ROLEX. SEVEN I'M SORRY SEVEN ROMAN CREASES INTO NINETEEN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND FOUR IN A ROW INCREASES IN TWENTY TWENTY AND JUST SO FAR THIS YEAR REVIVED APPROVES SIX ROLAND CREASES. THAT IS WHY REPORT I AM HAPPY TO BE HERE TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS BUT I WILL BE HONEST WITH YOU I'M GOING TO USE OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICER LORETTA MILBY FOR MAJORITY. OF THOSE QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. ANY OTHER CAR ROOM- THIS FORTY SEVEN A COMMA. BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC I JUST- WANTED TO BE HERE TO HELP ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT MIGHT BE MORE FROM MORE OF A NATIONAL PERSPECTIVE. GROWING CITY QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS. I THINK YOU HAVE A I THINK YOU WILL ANSWERED THEM DURING THE- HER QUESTIONS THAT WERE RAISED IN OTHER PORTIONS OF THE PROGRAM SO. I SEE NO QUESTIONS- THEN LET'S- SO THANK YOU. PERHAPS SOMEBODY WILL THINK OF ONE AS WE GO ALONG SO IF YOU ALL CAN STAY WITH US THAT WOULD BE GREAT. YOU HAVE TO DO LET'S NOW DISCUSS NURSING WORKFORCE AND SUPPLY. JOINING US IS GARY CHAN PRESIDENT CEO OF HEALTH IMPACT B. J. BURLESON VICE PRESIDENT NURSING AND CLINICAL SERVICES. FOR THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION. AND AB BLOOMBERG DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH FACILITIES. PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US. MISTER CHAIR YES EUROPE THANK YOU. TRYING TO TURN MY VOLUME DOWN SO CHAIR ROTH SURE LOW AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS OF THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY. PLEASE GUARD CHAD AND I AM THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF HEALTH IMPACT WHICH IS THE CALIFORNIA NURSING WORKFORCE AND POLICY CENTER. I AM ALSO CURRENTLY IN PRACTICE AS A NURSE PRACTITIONER AND HAVE BEEN SEEN PATIENTS AND WORKING IN OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH. DURING THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. I HAVE ALSO BEEN ADMINISTERING KOBE NINETEEN VACCINES TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AND IT'S AN HONOR TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PANEL WITH MY DISTINGUISHED COLLEAGUES TODAY. SO I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT- THE PERCEIVED OR REAL NURSING SHORTAGE IN CALIFORNIA. SO REPORT FIRST PROJECTIONS FOCUS ON SUPPLY AND DEMAND SUPPLY IS EASIER TO UNDERSTAND THE NUMBER OF GRADUATES ENTERING THE WORKFORCE THE NUMBER OF NURSES ENDORSING FROM OUT OF STATE STATE AND THE NUMBER OF RETIREES OR PEOPLE LEAVING THE STATE. BUT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE NURSING SHORTAGE WE ALSO THINK ABOUT THE DEMANDS. AND DEMAND ON THE OTHER HAND IS MUCH HARDER. IF WE LOOK AT THE MAN'S FACTORS SUCH AS THE PARK PERCENT OCCUPANCY OF ACUTE CARE INSTITUTIONS REVENUE AND REIMBURSEMENT TO PAY FOR THE WORK FORCE AND RATIOS PLAN IMPORTANT PART IN DETERMINING THE DEMAND FOR WORKFORCE. WE KNOW THAT THEIR REGIONAL SHORTAGE OF NURSES AND THE SEVERITY OF THE SHORTAGE DEPENDS ON THE METHODOLOGY OF CALCULATING SUPPLYING DEMANDS. BOTH UCSF WORKFORCE CENTER AND ALSO HAD PROJECTIONS ILLUSTRATE REGIONAL SHORTAGES DESPITE DIFFERENCES IN METHODOLOGIES. AS AN EXAMPLE WHEN WE LOOK AT THE US HAD TO BALANCE THIS FROM LAST YEAR SOME OF THE MARKETS THE LISTS ARE VERY SMALL AND WE KNOW THAT NURSES OFTEN COMMUTE ACROSS CITIES AND COUNTIES. AND THAT IS REALLY SPECIFIC AND THEY DID A GREAT JOB. TRYING TO. ANALYZE SENT FORTY MILLION NUMBER OF. EIGHT THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND AREAS- THE OSHKOSH METHOD ASSUMES HOWEVER THAT THE CORRECT LEVEL MAN'S IS THE NATIONAL TWENTY FIFTH PERCENTILE WHICH IS THE LEVEL OF DEPLOYMENTS WE'VE EVER HAD IN CALIFORNIA. WE DON'T KNOW IF EMPLOYERS REALLY WANT OR NEED THAT NUMBER OF NURSES TO MEET THE CARE NEEDS OF OUR POPULATION. SO IN SUMMARY ABOUT THE STATE WIDE OPEN REGIONAL UNDERSINK SHORTAGE WE DO HAVE NURSING SHORTAGES THAT ARE REGIONAL- AND THAT IN SOME PLACES ARE PRETTY SIGNIFICANT. I ALSO WANTED. I TEND TO BUY SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED TODAY- AND TALK ABOUT HOW YOUR RENDON AS IT RELATES TO WORKFORCE. SO IN MY OPINION THE R. AND PLAYS A ROLE IN THREE DISTINCT AREAS. LICENSING YOU GRADUATE NURSE VERSES AND ARCING INTO CALIFORNIA. PROVIDING JANAK REPORTS AND THREE BURSTING EDUCATION PROGRAM A COUPLE OFFICES. SO AS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED AROUND LICENSING WE DID NOTE THAT IN THE NOVEMBER EIGHTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY B. R. AND NEEDING THE BEER AND REPORTED ON THE AVERAGE PROCESSING TIMES SIX IN TERMS OF THE TIME THAT THEY SEE THE APPLICATION TO MOVING THE APPLICATION ON TO ITS NEXT STOP. WE SAW A DECREASE THE FIRST FOR EXAMINING YOUR SMITH PROCESSING TIMES AND STILL HERE NINETEEN AND FISCAL YEAR TWENTY- IT WENT FROM FOR EXAMS IT WENT DOWN FROM SIXTY FOUR POINT SIXTEEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN SCHOOL YEAR. DOWN TO NINE POINT FOUR DAYS FOR EXAMS IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN YEAR. AND FOUR DOOR SEDAN IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN YEAR IT WAS SIXTY POINT TWO DAYS. AND IT WENT DOWN TO EIGHTEEN POINT FOUR DAYS IN THE TWENTY WORKING NINE TO SCHOOL YEAR- AS OF. TODAY OR AS OF THE REPORT IN NOVEMBER HE DIDN'T SEE AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF DAYS FOR EXAMS SUDDENLY FROM- FROM THA POINT FOR UC'S TWENTY SIX. AND FORTY FOUR CENTS FROM EIGHTEEN POINT FOUR INTO TEAM SIXTY FOUR DAYS. IN THE. YEAR. SO EXOTIC EXECUTIVE OFFICER MEL B. DEVOTED APPS WEEK YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME LIVE SCOTT PROSTATE ISSUES- AND WHAT IT CALLS THEM DELAY. WE WOULD ASK YOU AROUND- CREATE A PROCESS FLOW MAP IDENTIFY AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT TO CONTINUE. A REDUCTION IN LICENSING TIMES. ALSO WE DON'T HAVE THE- ALEX IN RECORDS. ABOUT THE MEAN MEDIAN AND STANDARD DEVIATIONS ABOUT TOTAL PROCESSING TIMES OF LICENSES EXAMINING YOUR STUDENTS KNOW WE WOULD. ENCOURAGE THE PARENTS TO CONSIDER- DOING SOME STATISTICAL ANALYSES ON THOSE- PROCESSING TIME SO THAT WE CAN FIGURE OUT WAYS TO REDUCE THE DELAY. IN TERMS OF THE- WHAT'S THE B. R. AND HAS A STRONG HISTORY OF CONDUCTING PERIODIC SAMPLE SURVEYS OF THE NURSING WORKFORCE ON A VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THEIR WORK IN THIS AREA- WE'RE WAITING FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY SURVEY DATA BECAUSE THERE WAS A DELAY DUE TO. A BAD IS COMPLETE LINE OF THE UNDERSTAND OF ALL. AND SO WHEN WE SEE THE RELEASE REPORT WE CAN THEN START INTERPRETING THE DATA- WE DO NEED A MORE ROBUST MINIMUM DATA SET UP ALL LICENSE USED TO UNDERSTAND THE RACIAL AND ETHNIC MAKEUP OF THE PROFESSION. AS WELL AS UNDERSTANDING ZIP CODE SOMEWHERE LICENSEES LIVE AND WHERE THEY WORK. AND THEN THE THIRD AREA OF THE EDUCATIONAL CRUCIAL PROCESSES WHICH HAS BEEN ROBUSTLY DISCUSSED IN THE- HEARING TODAY- THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT. OF IN THE PRE LICENSURE PROGRAM APPROVAL STATUTES AND REGULATIONS AND- AT HEALTH IMPACT WE SUPPORT THE REDUCTION OF DUPLICATIVE ADMINISTRATIVE OVERSIGHT ODDS SICKENING THAT ADDS. LAYS THE PROCESS YOU WHERE THE B. R. AND OTHER NATIONAL AGENCIES ARE OVER OVERLY DUPLICATIVE AND SURELY CAN BE STREAMLINED WHILE MAINTAINING HIGH QUALITY EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS THAT STUDENTS CAN BE CONFIDENT ABOUT A TEN DAY AND- NIGHT THANK. YOU SIR MELBY. FOR SOME OF OUR PILOT WORK IN THIS AREA. MANY COMMUNITY AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING HEALTH IMPACT ARE WORKING ON ISSUES SUCH AS FACULTY ELEMENT INCREASE THE NUMBER. HELP SCHOOLS AND THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED HEARING. AND I WANT TO THANK CHAIR ROTH ENSURE LOW AND THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. THE CHEN BEFORE I'D TURN IT OVER TO THE NEXT THE PANELISTS TO SORT OF UNUSUAL BUT LET ME JUST ASK A QUESTION MAYBE YOU REFERENCE THIS. UP WHAT IMPACT ARE YOU ABLE TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC ON OUR NURSING WORKFORCE MOVING INTO THE FUTURE. IN OTHER WORDS. INCREASED RETIREMENTS SEPARATION FROM THE CAREER FIELD IT'S CENTER OR IS IT TOO EARLY TO TELL. IT'S A BIT TOO EARLY TO TELL AND THE OTHER- CONSIDERATION WITHOUT A MINIMUM DATA SITES. AROUND WHAT'S- STATUSES OF WORK WORK INDIVIDUALS IT'S HARD TO TELL- WE ALSO KNEW THAT THERE ARE PERIODIC OR TEMPORARY ISSUES THAT. HAVE COME INTO PLAY LIKE BOOKING LEAVES OF ABSENCES WHICH SCREAM SOMEBODY FROM THE WORK FORCE THAT IS FEDERALLY PROTECTED UNDER LAW. AND SO YES WELL THAT VACANCY IS NOT OFFICIAL THE OFFICIAL. OFFICIAL VACANCY. IN THE HEALTH CARE AND THAT AT WORK. A DECREASE IN THE AVAILABLE WORKFORCE AND SO- IT'S REALLY TOO EARLY TO TELL AND MANY PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS NATIONALLY ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GATHER THE DATA SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF COVER NINETEEN ON THE WORK FORCE AND I. WONDER IF- BJ BOTTLES OF THE MACALLAN HOSPITALS IS PATIENT AND ON THE OTHER STATES MIGHT HAVE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WELL THANK YOU FOR TAKING A SWING AT THAT WITH THAT LET'S TURN IT OVER TO THE NEXT PANELISTS- JUST BROKE. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON. CHAIRMAN ON CHAIRMAN ROSTAND'S COMMITTEE MEMBERS- CSKA FOR SIXTY OUR TEACHERS PRESENTS ON THIS EXTREMELY CRITICAL ARE IN WORK FORCE ISSUE. I WAS ASKED TO TALK ABOUT- THREE THINGS AND I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU MORE HIGH LEVEL INFORMATION AND- THERE IS A- FULL DETAILED INFORMATION IN A LETTER I WROTE TO THOSE COMMITTEES ON APRIL TWELFTH- SO THE FIRST TIME THAT TO TARGET. WAS WHY IS THERE NURSING WORKFORCES HOSPITALS. AS YOU MOST OF THE MOST OF YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLDS THE STATION REPRESENTS OVER FOUR HUNDRED WORLD URBAN SUBURBAN PUBLIC NONPROFIT AND INVESTOR OWNED FACILITIES WHERE OVER 60% OR APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIA'S FLOYD ARE AND WORK. RN'S THE OPERATIONAL LIFELINE IN ACUTE CARE FACILITY AND HOSPITALS AND HEALTH SYSTEMS RELY ON THEM TO MEET THE EVER CHANGING NEEDS OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. AND YOU ALL KNOW THIS WAS CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED LAST YEAR SINCE THE PANDEMIC. AND IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT THE ACCURATE NUMBERS IS STILL MAKES IT FAR AND STASHING IS MAINTAINED SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE QUALITY ACCESS PATIENT SAFETY. TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. EVERY HEALTH CARE OR- IS THERE. SO YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT ALL THE DIVERSITY AMONG STAR ORGANIZATIONS AND NURSES THAT MUST CAREFULLY EVALUATE COMPLEXITIES. AND NEEDS OF THOSE PATIENT POPULATIONS AND STRIVE TO EXECUTE AN APPROPRIATE ARE AND WORK FORCE. TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION MULTIPLE THINGS ARE IN STAFFING RATIOS ARE IN SKILL NEXT PATIENT ACUITY HOSPITAL SERVICE LINES ECONOMIC FACTORS ETCETERA. ZIJIN ARE AND STAFFING ISSUES CALL EDUCATION CARE REDUCES ERRORS REDUCE PATIENT MORTALITY MORBIDITY AND NUMBER OF PREVENTABLE ON SORT OF DANCE. SO WHY IS THE PRECISE COMPOSITION OF THE R. AND WORKFORCE PORTANTINO. OUR AND CARE MUST BE MATCHED TO PATIENT NEEDS AND ARE IS THAT THE LIVER CARE VERY AND EXPERTISE AND THEIR SCOPE OF PRACTICE YOU LOCKED IN HERE IS TALKING ABOUT NOVICE AND EXPERT R&amp;D FOR NEW NURSES AND SPECIALTY OR EXPERT NURSES AND THERE THERE IS ALL THERE IS A DIFFERENCE THERE AND HAVING THE RIGHT COMPOSITION. OF THOSE NEW OR NOVICE TO EXPERT NURSES IS IMPORTANT SO THAT PATIENTS CAN BE PROVIDED THE RIGHT CARE AT THE RIGHT TIME FOR THE RIGHT AROUND AND TEACHING ORIENTATION OF NEW GRADUATES BE ACCOMPLISHED. OF HOSPITALS NURSING WORKFORCE NEEDS TO BE CONFIDENCE TO MEET STAFFING RATIOS COMEDY HAJNAL ACUTE INPATIENT CARE DEMANDS WORKS- CAN'T ACCES ASTERS AS WE'VE SEEN AND MEDICINE MEDICATION REQUIREMENTS AS WELL AS ONLINE SCHEDULING NEEDS OF A. DYNAMIC- AND WORK FORCE. WITH THE WIND. OF CALIFORNIA NURSING WORK FOR HEADING WEST THAN FIVE YEARS NURSING. IT A HERITAGE THE NEW YORK. TO THE PERSON. YOUR FIRST. ASIAN EXPERT HELPED THEIR SKILLS MAINTAINERS WORKFORCE WILDERNESS HI. AND THIS IS AS WHY HOSPITALS CLINICAL PLACE RAINING SLAPS AND THEIR AVAILABILITY HIRING PRACTICES DICTATED. AND LEVEL OF IRAN'S THAT INDIVIDUAL. HOSPITALS TENANTS COMEDY. AND I ONE OF TO WORK ON FLORIDA'S COMMON ABOUT SPACE WE DO OFFER CLIENTS PLACEMENT MEDICINE TO THE IRAN IT'S NOT A REGULATION BUT THAT IS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT ALL THAT STARTED ON BEHALF OF THE ARE IN. THE HOSPITAL SALAS. I STILL NEED TO HAVE A SUBTLE PIPELINE OF NEW. AND X. ARE A STUFF A CALL STYLE RATIO REQUIRE. MAINTAIN THEY- HE THEY ARE ASKED ME A VITAL SOURCE OF EXPERIENCE ARE AND WORK FORCE OUT OF STATERS NURSE- BUT JUST. YOUR SECRET IS EXTREMELY CRITICAL SUPPORTING OUR RURAL AND CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITALS AND THIS IS THE PRODUCT DURING THAT PANEL DISCUSSIONS HERE WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT A WRONG CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITALS. AND HER ABILITY TO NURSES. TO THAT YES AND AS MANY OF OUR HEALTH SYSTEMS GROWN EXPAND ACROSS STATE BOUNDARIES MULTI STATE LICENSURE IS BECOMING- MORE CRITICAL EASIER THIS PROCESS IS THE TIME HONOR TIMELIER WE CAN PROVIDE ACCESS TO CARE QUALITY CARE FOR PATIENTS. SO WITHOUT AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF OUR MEN'S HOSPITALS CANNOT STAFF THAT IS FOR CARE OF PATIENTS AND. I THINK ZERO. TRYING TO MEET EARNED IT. THAT IS GOING. A DOUBLING OF OUR AND WE TRY BETWEEN THE AGES FIFTY IT'S FOUR CENTS THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. MORE RACK YOUR PLEASE HANG OUR X. R&amp;S. ALSO WERE AT NEW S. T. Y. ESTá MEANT THAT THE STATE OR INSPIRED WILL BE SIXTY DOT ARE IN SLOW. PROJECTED THOUSAND NINETEEN THAT'S WHEN THE HEALTH WORKFORCE CENTER- DOCTORS YES.

MY NAME ONLY ONE BURKE AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH FACILITIES OR CALF. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE COMMENTS REGARDING THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING IN THE NURSING WORKFORCE CHALLENGES LONG TERM CARE. CALF WAS FOUNDED IN NINETEEN FIFTY AND IS A NONPROFIT TRADE ASSOCIATION WHOSE MEMBERS LED SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITIES FOR THE DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED AND PEDIC'S ACUTE DISABILITIES. THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN HUNDRED FREESTANDING SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT SIR FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PATIENTS A YEAR AND HAVE APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND EMPLOYEES. YLIDES ARSONISTS I'M IN THE MIDST FRAIL ELDERLY IN THE STATE. AND ARE PIECE ON THE LONG TERM CARE CAN. APPROXIMATELY SIXTY SEVEN OF OUR PATIENTS ARE ON MEDICAID. BETWEEN KAREN MEDIKAL ARCUS ARE ALMOST AND GOVERNMENT FUNDED. OUR SKILLED PERSON FACILITY CONSISTS OF REGISTER NURSES LICENSED VOCATIONAL NURSES AND CERTIFIED NURSE ASSISTANTS.

HERE'S INSTRUCTORS THE INCREASE AND HAS NOT KEPT PACE WITH THE MARKET PLACE. HAVE A SELECTIVE ONLINE TRAINING PROGRAMS RECOGNIZED A THREE AND A GREATER DEGREE AND IT'S CLEAR THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT NEW INVESTMENT. I'M MORE BRIDGE FOR ALL THE END TO BSN PROGRAMS. CASH STRONGLY ENCOURAGES A BREAK THIS AUDIT GERIATRICS THE NURSING CURRICULUM WHETHER THAT. RECCHI RESIDENCY GERIATRIC SPECIALTY OR BUYING IT TIETJENS OF THAT NURSING STUDENTS ARE MORE COMFORTABLE AND GAIN ADDITIONAL EXPOSURE AND INTEREST AND LONG TERM CARE. THESE ARE JUST A FEW WAYS WE CAN ENCOURAGE MORE OR NURSES TO WORK IN THE LONG TERM CARE SETTING. FINALLY AFRICAN THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING EXPAND ITS MEMBERSHIP THAT HAPPENED ONE LONG TERM CARE POST ACUTE TO WRECK. ON THE BORDER. GIVEN OURSTATE'S RAPIDLY GROWING AGING POPULATION AND THE STATE'S INVESTMENT AND ISSUES SUCH AS THE MASTER PLAN ON AGING THERE NEEDS TO BE SOMEONE ON YOUR AND THAT WAS LACKS WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE COMMUNITY. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE CAST PERSPECTIVE I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. FORGIVABLE BURKE. JUST ONE QUICK QUESTION- AND THEN. MAYBE WE COULD MOVE INTO MY EARLIER DATA QUESTION WHAT YOU AND THE OTHER PANELISTS BUT- DOES THE OF THE BEER IN STAMFORD LICENSE PROCESS. MITIGATE CALIPHATE ANYWAY CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT FAILURE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE LICENSE CONFESSIONAL ICING'S LICENSE COMPACT FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE. AND I THINK THAT HAS SOME I'M NOT AND- AN EXPERT I COULD CHECK A LITTLE BIT MORE ON AND PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND. A LOT OF OUR- AND- NURSING SHORTAGE FOCUS HAS BEEN CERTIFIED NURSE ASSISTANTS WHICH ARE OUTSIDE OF THE PURVIEW OF. AMITY AND- BUT I COULD GET YOU A LITTLE MORE DETAIL. OKAY THANK YOU- WITH RESPECT TO PANELISTS WITH RESPECT TO MY EARLIER QUESTION ON THE DATA. MR CHEN PERHAPS YOU ADDRESS THIS BUT I GUESS MY QUESTION IS THE DATA THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE. THEY WERE TRYING TO USE TO BALANCE THE- OUTPUT WITH WORKPLACE NEEDS SUFFICIENTLY DETAILED CURRENT- AND CERTAIN TO DO THAT SORT OF PLANNING AND- IF SO FINE AND IF NOT WHAT IS IT AGAIN THAT WE NEED TO DO. YES THANK YOU CHAIR ROSS FOR THE UESTION- TWENTY EIGHT BECAUSE MY VOLUME HERE- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO GET FROM THE B. R. AND IS AN EVERY TWO YEAR- SAMPLE SURVEY OF NURSES AND PRACTICE AND THE SAMPLE SURVEY IS DONE PERRANCE SCIENTIFICALLY MEANING THAT- IT THE TRYING TO REPRESENT ALL NURSES IN. DIFFERENT PARTS OF CALIFORNIA- I AM AWARE OF ASSEMBLY BILL TWELVE THIRTY SIX BYE ASSEMBLY MEMBER TANG WHO IS LOOKING TO CREATE A MINIMUM DATA SETS- FOR LICENSE FEES BECAUSE WE DO NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE OF THE WORK FORCE AND AS THEY RENEW THEIR LICENSES- AND SO I THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL TO CREATE A MINIMUM DATA SET. OF FOR NOT JUST NURSING BUT ALL OF THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHERE PEOPLE ARE WORKING HOW MUCH THEY'RE WORKING WHERE ARE THEY LIVING AND WORKING. FOR MIGRATION QUESTIONS- AND SO I A AM HOPEFUL THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER TEAMS THE BILL AB TWELVE THIRTY SIX WILL CONTINUE TO- GAIN TRACTION THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE TO HELP US UNDERSTAND WITH LICENSURE RENEW ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT WE NEED TO ADEQUATELY PROJECTS WORKFORCE SUPPLY AND DEMAND. THEN YOU MAY HAVE ANSWERED MY NEXT QUESTION OR TWO. YOU KNOW WE KNOW- WE KNOW BECAUSE THE VARIOUS DISCUSSIONS THAT WE'VE HAD. IN THIS CHAMBER IN THE LEGISLATURE GENERALLY OVER THE LAST EIGHT NAY HALF YEARS OR SO THAT. PHYSICIANS FOR EXAMPLE GENERALLY WORK WHERE THEY TRAINED FOR EXAMPLE PHYSICIANS WHO ARE ENROLLED IN RESIDENCY PROGRAMS AND- IN INLAND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THE STATISTICS SHOW WILL TYPICALLY STAY IN PRACTICE IN INLAND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. I ASSUME WE- DO NOT HAVE THAT SORT OF DATA WITH RESPECT TO THE NURSING. GRADUATES IS THAT A FAIR STATEMENT. YES THAT'S A FAIR STATEMENT AND I THINK WITH THE- GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO LOOK AT- THE REORGANIZATION ACOSTA HAD- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WORKS WELL IS- GROW WHERE YOU LIVE PROGRAMS SO TAKING PEOPLE FROM THE COMMUNITY AND HELING THEM GO THROUGH A PROGRAM- THAT CAN HELP THEM STAY WHERE THEY ACTUALLY. ARE COMING FROM WE KNOW THAT IN GENERAL BIERCE'S ACROSS THE COUNTRY. LIVE ABOUT I'M SORRY FIFTY MILES OF WHERE THEY WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL. YOU SIT IN THE BACK OF THE NUMBER SO WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE SUPPORT- RURAL AREAS AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES WHERE THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT NURSING SHORTAGE- THERE WAS A SENATOR. ON THE FAR NORTH IN THE FEES YOU KNOW AND SISKIYOU COUNTY. THAT SPOKE EARLIER AND WE DO NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW THIS WORKS. THE GROWTH OF THE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE IN THESE RURAL AREAS- THROUGH CLINICAL FACULTY TRAINING- RETENTION PROGRAM SCHOLARSHIP. AND LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAMS TO HELP PEOPLE STAY WHERE THEY- I GREW UP- THE AREA IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST HE'D AREAS OF NURSING HOME TREE AND SO IT'S A GREAT DRAW FOR PEOPLE TO COME TO THE AREA AND- WORK AND THEN GO BACK- HOME. AFTER THEY FINISH A FEW CHEFS AND SO- SUPPLY AND DEMAND ESPECIALLY AROUND VALERIE TO. ANY BLOOMBERG'S EARLIER COMMENTS ABOUT. THE WORK FORCE IF YOU NURSING FACILITY THERE ARE A LOT OF FACILITIES- IS REALLY A GREAT ISSUE WHEN WE LOOK AT- SUPPLY AND. AND RT- SO REGION'S DID YOU SAY THAT NURSES TEND TO TEND TO WORK WITHIN FIFTY MILES FIFTY MILES OF WHERE THEY ATTENDED HIGH SCHOOL. YEAH SO WITHIN FIFTEEN MILES WHERE THEY WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL. HAVE THERE BEEN ANY SURVEYS TO TRY TO DETERMINE WHAT MIGHT INCREASE- MOBILITY WITHIN THE POOL OF AVAILABLE NURSES WHAT WOULD INCENTIVIZE THE NURSES FOR EXAMPLE WHO TRAIN IN THE BAY AREA OR TRAIN AND- THE LOS ANGELES AREA TO RELOCATE TO MEDICALLY UNDER SERVED- AREAS TO PERFORM- HEALTH CARE SERVICES. YES THERE HAVE BEEN SOME SMALL STUDIES AND DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS TO HELP PEOPLE INTEGRATE INTO THE COMMUNITY AND IT'S REALLY A SENSE OF BELONGING WHICH IS THE STRONGEST- PROTECTOR OF PEOPLE STAYING IN A COMMUNITY WHERE THEY CAN GROW UP IN SO. I MEAN IT IS SUCH AS- OPPOSE THE COUNT AND SIERRA FOOTHILLS ARE REAL TRYING TO. PEOPLE TO HELP THEM FEEL LIKE THEY'RE A PART OF THE COMMUNITY SO THAT THEY- SET DOWN ROOTS IN THAT COMMUNITY AND STAY FOR THE LONG TERM. AND SO THE MORE THAT WE CAN HELP CREATE THESE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE TO FEEL LIKE THEY BELONG IN THE COMMUNITY AS JUST SUPPOSED TO. BE SPENT TWO YEARS IN THE- UNDERSERVED AREA FOR MY LITTLE MAKE LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM- THINKING ABOUT ONE OF THE SUPPORT FROM THE COMMUNITY TO HELP PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY BELONG. VERY GOOD THANK YOU AND FOR THE HEALTH FACILITIES HAVE YOU HAVE YOUR FACILITIES BEEN ABLE TO- ENGAGE IN PRACTICES BEST PRACTICES FOR EXAMPLE THAT. ASSISTED NURSES COMING OF TO CALIFORNIA THROUGH THE- THE OUT OF STATE PROCESS. INDOORS WHEN I THINK WE CALLED IN DIVERS BEEN PROCESS- TO ASSIST THOSE NURSES AND MOVING TO CALIFORNIA AND QUICKLY MOVING THROUGH THE BOARD OF- OF REGISTERED NURSING PROCESS. YES CENTER OFFICES CJ FROM CJ THANK YOU AND- HE YEAH I THINK. NOW I'M ON THE HEAD WITH A FINGERPRINT ISSUE THAT SEEMS TO BE LESS IF YOU WERE A KID AND- ANY HELP WE MIGHT HAVE THEIR IN SOME RESPECTS WOULD. PROBABLY FACILITATE ENDORSEMENT TIMEFRAMES BUT THAT. THEY HAVE TO RELY STANDING CALIFORNIA I MEAN IF YOU LIVE IN VIRGINIA YOU'RE COMING HERE. YOU HAVE TO MAKE A TRIP. THAT I WILL SAY THAT IT IS A- LITTLE STATE- WHEN TO TRY. COME MANY THEM RETURN- HAVING THAT ENDORSE PROCESS EASIERAND IT'S THE FINGERPRINT ISSUES THAT IS ONE OF THE BIG BARRIERS. AND WHATEVER WE ALL CAN DO TO BREAK DOWN THAT BARRIER- I THINK WE'RE ALL. WAYS TO RAISE HELP LORETTA THE BEER AND DO IT. WE INTEND TO CERTAINLY EXPLORE THE HAVING IF THE QUOTE AND HAVING RECEIVED THE INFORMATION SO WE'RE WE'RE ON IT. PANELS ANYTHING FURTHER BEFORE WE MOVE TO OUR NEXT PANEL. OKAY COLLEAGUES ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS I SEE NONE. OUR FINAL PANEL WILL HELP US UNDERSTAND NURSING CLINICAL EDUCATION AND PLACEMENTS WE'VE COVERED THAT SOME BUT I'M SURE THERE'S MORE TO COVER. ON THIS CRITICAL TOPIC WE WILL HEAR. FROM DR ELLIS MARTIN NICK MARTIN THE GARA ASSOCIATE DEAN DIRECTOR OF NURSING GOLDEN WEST COLLEGE. MESCALINE O'LEARY KELLY DIRECTOR AND PROFESSOR VALLEY FOUNDATION SCHOOL OF NURSING CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SAN JOSE. MRS RENEE SWEITZER VICE PRESIDENT UNIVERSITY RELATIONS WEST COAST UNIVERSITY AND MS KT WAXMAN DIRECTOR CALIFORNIA'S SIMULATION ALLIANCE HEALTH IMPACT PANELISTS PLEASE PROCEED. HI GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE- JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT- OUR BACKGROUND- I'M ASSOCIATE DEAN AND DIRECTOR OF NURSING- FOR TO COMMIT COLLEGE AT GOLDEN WEST COLLEGE WHICH IS LOCATED IN ORANGE COUNTY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IT'S SOMETHING THAT BEACH. I'VE I'VE BEEN ASKED TODAY TO SPEAK ON CLINICAL EDUCATION AND PLACEMENT. SO I CAN JUST SHARE WITH YOU A STORY THAT IS REALLY NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART I'M A PRODUCT OF GOLDEN WEST COLLEGE AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROGRAM AND THIS PROGRAM OPEN THE DOOR TO ME AS A SINGLE MOTHER SIMPLER KIND OF. JOURNEY OFF THE SMOKE TO YEAH SO CAME OUT OF MY SHORTLIST RETIREMENT DURING THE MIDDLE OF THIS PANDEMIC TO RETURN BACK TO ACADEMIA. TO ADDRESS- ASSISTANCE. AS WELL AS MICHAEL AND COLLEGE SAYS. SHOULD NOT BE THROUGH THIS TANDEM M. IN PARTICULAR AND- TO ADDRESS THE CLINICAL PLACEMENT ISSUES- YOU KNOW THE TOPIC OF CLINICAL PLACEMENTS HAS BEEN ONGOING SINCE MICHAEL PAYER IN- NURSING ACADEMIA. I COULD SAY BECAUSE OF- CLINICAL CONCERNS THAT'S BEEN OVER LOOMING OVER THE YEARS IT'S REALLY PARTLY- OUR ANALYSIS IS THE CHANGES AT THAT THE TWO CHANGES THAT IMPACT US. SO NUMBER ONE THE CHANGES IN THE HOSPITAL STAY AND THE CENSUS GREATLY GREATLY IMPACT THE ACCESS TO PATIENTS AND NURSING STUDENTS. WHEN DOES HAPPENS THE INCREASE A PROPRIETARY NURSING PROGRAM ALSO CAME INTO PLAY AND IS ALSO GREATLY IMPACT THE AVAILABILITY AND ACCESS TO PATIENTS IN THE MIXING CORPORATE. AND SO WITH THE COME OF THE TWO AND A CHALLENGE FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE NURSING BE INCENTIVE RECTORS WE ARE. BASICALLY TRYING TO CONTINUE TO PUSH UP BLUNTING THE NURSING PROGRAMS WITH VERY LIMITED RESOURCES AND FOR THE STATE FUNDED PROGRAMS I CAN SAY MEDIA VERY STRETCH WITH A NURSING- CLINICAL PLACEMENTS AND EVEN THE REPLACEMENT OF CLINICAL PLACEMENTS AS DEMONSTRATED DURING ECONOMIC COLUSA MALAYSIAN. WE HAVE A BEAUTIFUL ACCESS TO- NICE BUILDING GREAT. HOWEVER THE EQUIPMENT AND THE TRAINING FOR FACULTY TO USE WITH THIS CUSTOMER RELATION AND THAT. WITH A STATE YOU ACCESS WHEN I CAN WALK IT'S MY OLD COLLEGE I WAS REALLY SURPRISED AT HOW MUCH OF A- HOW MUCH FAR BEHIND THAT OUR COLLEGE IS IN COMPARISON TO PROPRIETARY. I'VE WORKED BOTH SIDES OF THE FENCE WHERE I'VE WORKED FOR PROPRIETARY ACADEMIA SETTING AND I'VE WORKED ALSO FOR PUBLIC. STATE FUNDED PROGRAMS. I YOU KNOW I BELIEVE AS- MUCH AS WE WILL LIKE DO WE WANT. THE COMMUNITY THE STATE THEY DO AND SAY THAT THEY HAVE SHARED DUTIES THESE RESEARCH SAYING- YOU CAN GO TO THE CLINICS WELL GUESS WHO GOALS AND KNOCKING ON THE DOOR IT WOULD BE US THE NURSING TEAMS WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF FOR THE MANPOWER AS WE DO- IF I'VE HAD WORK IN A PROPRIETARY AND I HAVE A CLINICAL PLACEMENT COORDINATOR. THE CONTRACT AND LOOK FOR ALL OF THESE CLINICAL PLACEMENTS WE ARE SO FAR BEHIND AS A STATE FUNDED FACILITY THAT NOT ONLY WE NEED RESOURCES PROBABLY NEED TO BE ABLE TO NOT HAVE OR CLINICAL PLACEMENTS BE TAKEN AWAY BY OTHER SCHOOLS WHO CAN BE A LITTLE BIT AHEAD OF US BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE MANPOWER AND RESOURCES. TO LOOK FOR THESE ALTERNATIVE CLINICAL PLACEMENTS AND AS FAR AS COMMUNITY BASED CLINICAL PLACEMENTS OF CLINICS AS MISS MEL B. HAS- GENTLY SAID IN THE FIRST REPORT. OF HER- FRAZIER HEARING MEETING- THESE CLINICS SOME SO HAVE LARENZ AND ARE PRO IS A LOT OF ROOM. WHERE WE NEED A MARIN SUPER THE SUIT. NOW WITH AS MUCH FIVE AS WE HAVE. I HAVE BE IN DIFFERENT AT ONE GIVEN TIME. THE JUST. IT IS ALMOST AND- SO HOW AND I AM FOR TO STAFF ONE FACULTY. TO STUDENTS IN THE CLINIC. AND BE ABLE TO USE THAT AS CLINICAL PLACEMENTS WHAT A NORMAL TYPICAL CLINICAL GROUP IS TEN STUDENTS. THAT IS WHAT I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU WHAT THE HOW WE ARE WORKING AT THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND- THE BRN HAS BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE. BUT THEY COULD BE BETTER. YOU KNOW WE LOOK FORWARD TO SOME OF THE INNOVATION THAT MISS MOBLIE IS LOOKING FORWARD TO BRINGING INTO THE PRM TO AUTOMATE SOME OF THE PROCESSES SHE SPOKE EARLIER ABOUT- UP STUDENTS APPLYING FOR AND FLEX WELL MY COLLEGE IS A PUBLIC INSTITUTION TAKES ABOUT FOUR WEEKS TO PROCESS. THE TRANSCRIPTS BECAUSE I CANNOT MAKE A REGISTROS GO ANY FASTER THE TIME FOR A DEGREE SNS THAT TRANSCRIPT IS AVAILABLE WE UPLOAD THEM RIGHT AWAY BECAUSE WE KNOW OUR GRADUATES A LADY. IN THE. MEANTIME I. HAVE FOR HER STUDENTS. THE APPLY TO MY PROGRAM I CAN ONLY TAKE FORTY FIVE STUDENTS ONE SEMESTER. AND NOW FORTY FIVE STUDENTS. ONE NOT AS OPEN TO HAVING THAT DISCUSSION WITH THEM- COMMIT COLLEGE WE HAVE A CONSORTIUM OF NEED DISCUSSED WITH EACH OTHER IF WE HAVE A CONFLICT WE WILL ONE OF US WILL MAKE ROOM SO THE OTHER ONE CAN PASS THEIR STUDENTS TO PROVE. WE WORK IT OUT BUT WE DO NOT SEE THAT BECAUSE I AM ALSO THE CO CHAIR OF THE CONSORTIUM IN ORANGE COUNTY LONG BEACH. AND I KNOW FOR A FACT I CAN TELL YOU WHO'S BEEN ATTENDING DOES. DOES CONSORTIUM MEETINGS AND WE DO NOT HAVE PROPRIETARY SCHOOLS WORKING IT OUT WITH ANOTHER COMMUTER STATE FUNDED SCHOOL. SO I WANT SHARE THAT STORY TO YOU AND ANYTHING YOU WOULD LIKE TO ASK. THANK YOU. YEAH. LET ME ASK A QUESTION IS IT. SO IS IT A SHORTAGE OF PLACEMENTS IN A CUTE. CARE FACILITIES THAT'S THE ISSUE. YES THAT THE SHORTAGES THE IN THE SPECIALTIES ESPECIALLY IN THE QUEUE CARE SETTING WE HAVE TRIED THE COMMUNITY SETTINGS AND IT'S JUST IMPOSSIBLE TO STAFF IT WITH OUR FACULTY. BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT ENOUGH THEY'RE NOT ENOUGH OPPORTUNITIES TO PUT A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN THERE TO MAKE THE FACULTY ASSIGNMENT. EFFECTIVE SAYS SOFTLY. THE LICENSURE STUDENTS THEY'RE NOT LICENSE SO WE CANNOT JUST LEAVE THEM ALONE WITH THE PATIENT. HELLO OTHER OF THE OTHER PARTICIPANTS WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN HERE BUT LET ME WHILE I HAVE YOU LET ME JUST ASK ONE. ONE QUESTION HAVE YOU HAVE YOU DETECTED BECAUSE OF THE IN THE ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL SETTING THE PRESSURE FROM THE ACCREDITING AGENCIES TO FOR MAGNET STATUS AND HIRING BACHELOR'S DEGREE- NURSES OR STUDENTS WHO ARE PURSUING BACHELOR'S DEGREE. STATUS HAVE YOU HAVE YOU DETECTED. THAT AS AN ISSUE IN. HOSPET DECIDING WHETHER TO. PROVIDE YOUR STUDENTS WITH CLINICAL PLACEMENTS WERE NOT. WELL IT'S YES AND NO I CANNOT SPEAK FOR ALL HOSPITALS I CAN JUST TELL YOU THAT. FOR US IT'S BUILDING THAT RELATIONSHIP HOWEVER AND OUR STUDENTS I CAN TELL YOU 90% OF MY STUDENTS ARE MOVING ON TO A BACHELOR'S DEGREE BY THE TIME THEY FINISH THE THIRD YEAR OF SEMESTER. AND THIS IS A FOUR SEMESTER- PROGRAM IT'S A TWO YEAR PROGRAM. SO THE HOSPITAL'S PREFERRED AT SOME OF THE PROPRIETARY BECAUSE WE CANNOT PROVIDE ANY TYPE OF COMPENSATION WE CAN'T EVEN PROVIDE C. USE FAR NURSES WHO WORK WITH OUR STUDENTS BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE THE RIGHT THING TO DO. BECAUSE TECHNICALLY DAY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE PRECEPT THING AND TRAINING OUR STUDENTS. SO THIS IS NOT A C. E. U. TYPE OF THE CLASS DOESN'T NEED TO SEE YOU AS A QUIET. AND SO DOES WHERE OUR- THEY SAY IT'S MAGNET MAGNET MEANS YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN EDUCATION PLAN. TO GO TO XPS THAT. FOX IT DOESN'T SEND YOU OR ME AS- AN INDIVIDUAL- IN GAUGE WITH A BSN PROGRAM. AND SOME WE DO FAILED. AS AN ATM CARD AS AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE PROGRAM ESPECIALLY THE STATE FUNDED PROGRAM WHO DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO PROVIDE TO THE HOSPITAL'S FOR A LOT OF THINGS I WE BARELY COULD EVEN AFFORD PP. DURING THIS CALL WITH PANDEMIC. AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO AS IT APPEARS BY THE BOOK. DIMENSIONAL I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE ROOF I AM I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE IT SEE SEE YOU. YES THAT'S A THING EDUCATION UNITS THAT YOU SPOKE OFF THE LOBBY AND THE POLICY OF PRESIDENT OF. YOU JUST NEED A THANK YOU ANYTHING ELSE MEMBER FOR I'VE YOU DON'T LEAVE ME YOU HAVE SOME QUESTIONS I'M SURE. ANYTHING ELSE THANK YOU OKAY. I DO SUPPORT IMPOR FULL OF OUR B. AND TO BE ABLE TO LEAD US INTO WHAT WE HOPE AND WISH WHICH IS A STANDARDIZED CURRICULUM ACROSS THE STATE. I BELIEVE STEP AND ESCORT COLOGNE FOR ALL PARTIES WHETHER YOU'RE PUBLIC FUNDED OR YOUR PROPRIETARY WILL ASSIST WITH ALL OF THE- CLINICAL PLACEMENTS AT LEAST. THE PLAYING FIELD WILL BE LEVEL. EACH RIGHT NOW IT DEPENDS ON HOW MANY UNITS YOUR CLINICAL CLASS IT'S HOW LONG YOU STAY IN THE HOSPITAL. BECAUSE SECURE UNITS OF THREE UNITS AND I'M OFFERING WILL BE ONE MINUTE CLASS. FIRST MY ONE UNIT IS ONLY SO MANY HOURS AND YOUR THREE UNITS WILL TAKE UP ALL THE ROOMS IN THE HOSPITAL. SO STANDARDIZED CURRICULUM WITH THEIR SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE OF THE BRF AND HEALTH CLASS. FORWARD AND ALSO THEIR FLEXIBILITY AND LOOKING AT SIMULATIONS AS COMING THEM S. CLINICAL HOURS. WHEN WE CAN PROVIDE THAT. RESOURCE AND THAT SUPPORT. I THINK IT IT IT LISTENERS POSSIBLE OF THIS FOCUSED THAT'S BEEN ALL ACROSS THE- THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH MA'AM. I GUESS MRS CILLER KELLY. RAPTURED AFTERNOON. I'LL LET ME MUTE MY SPEAKER. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY NURSING DIRECTORS. I WILL BE ADDRESSING SOME OF THE CRITICAL ISSUES WERE FACING RELATED TO DECREASE CLINICAL PLACEMENTS. I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE BALLOT FOUNDATION SCHOOL OF NURSING AT SAN JOSE STATE UNIVERSITY. WE HAVE A THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE PRE LICENSURE STUDENTS IN THE BACCALAUREATE PROGRAM. THIS CSU ROLES APPROXIMATELY FORTY SEVEN HUNDRED AND GRADUATES OVER SIXTEEN HUNDRED PRE LICENSURE BSN STUDENTS EVERY YEAR. AND AS EDUCATORS WE ARE COMMITTED TO PROVIDE THE FINEST EVIDENCE BASED LEARNING EXPERIENCES THAT PROMOTE THE DEVELOPMENT OF CLINICAL JUDGMENT THE STATE PRACTICE IN OUR GRADUATES. DURING A PANDEMIC SEVERAL ISSUES HAVE COME TO THE FOREFRONT WHICH IMPACTED OUR ABILITY TO MEET STUDENTS ACADEMIC AND PERSONAL GOALS. IN MARCH TWENTY TWENTY STUDENTS WERE DISPLACED FROM CLINICAL SITES WHERE PARTNER HOSPITALS. NOW OVER A YEAR LATER CLINICAL DISPLACEMENT CONTINUES TO BE A SERIOUS PROBLEM. ALTHOUGH SOME CLINICAL SITES HAVE A LOT OF STUDENTS TO RETURN MANY HAVE CUT THE PRETTY PANDEMIC NUMBERS OF CLINICAL DAYS ALLOWED IN ORDER TO MAKE ROOM FOR SEVERAL SCHOOLS OR THEY LIMITED THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS ALLOWED ON THE UNIT PER SHIFT. A CLINICAL GROUPS NORMALLY TEN STUDENTS PER INSTRUCTOR. SO WITH THE DECREASING CLINICAL SITES FACULTY WERE REQUIRED TO TAKE LARGER GROUPS OF STUDENTS. BUT ONLY ROTATE A SMALL GROUP THROUGH ITS ISSUE ISFOUR TO SIX STUDENTS EVERY OTHER WEEK. THE NURSING PROGRAM INVOLVES THE SEQUENTIAL PROCESS OF STUDENT COHORTS COMPLETING A COURSE OF STUDY EACH SEMESTER. AND ALTHOUGH WE PLANNED OUT THE ROTATIONS FOR GROUPS THE CLINICAL SITES EACH WEEK THE LACK OF PLACEMENTS OFTEN DELAYED STUDENTS ABILITY TO FINISH CARE HOURS AND PROGRESS TO THE NEXT SEMESTER. THE INITIAL EMERGENCY WAIVER FROM DCA ALLOWED UP 250% OF SIMULATION FOR DIRECT CARE HOURS. PASSAGE OF ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY TWO EIGHTY EIGHT PROVIDED ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY FOR SCHOOLS OF NURSING TO MEET DIRECT CARE HOURS WITH SIMULATION. WE HAVE CONTINUED TO PROVIDE UP 250% CLINICAL SIMULATION. I MERRILY USING VIRTUAL AND ONLINE DIRECT PATIENT CARE HOURS HAVE BEEN HELD A 50% H. FACULTY DOCUMENTED THE NUMBER OF DIRECT CARE AND SIMULATION HOURS FOR EACH STUDENT. DESPITE OUR BEST EFFORTS THE LACK OF CLINICAL SITES AND STATE REQUIREMENT FOR SMALL GROUPS OF STUDENTS ROTATING THROUGH HAS COST APPROXIMATELY FORTY OF OUR STUDENTS WHO WILL NEED TO COMPLETE HOURS AFTER THE END OF THIS SEMESTER. HOPEFULLY COMPLETING THEIR DIRECT CARE HOURS BY JUNE THIRTIETH. OTHER CSU PROGRAMS ARE EXPERIENCING SIMILAR ISSUES. THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING HAS NOT SHOWN INTEREST TO CONTINUE THE INCREASE IN SIMULATION IN FACT EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC THE BOARD RESISTED REQUESTS FOR INCREASING CLINICAL SIMULATION IN OUR PRE LICENSURE PROGRAMS. THIS IS UNFORTUNATE AS SIMULATION IS A BEST PRACTICE THAT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN HEALTH CARE EDUCATION INCLUDING MEDICINE FOR SEVERAL YEARS. IT SOUNDS A STATE WE'VE USED TO STANDARDIZE PROGRAM OF CLINICAL SIMULATIONS SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN. OUR FACULTY ARE EDUCATED IN THE PRINCIPLES OF SIMULATION BASED EDUCATION. AND WE USE ESTABLISH STANDARDS AS A MEANS TO ENHANCE THE DEVELOPMENT OF CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND SAFE PRACTICE. USING EVIDENCE BASED SIMULATION PRACTICES IS A SOUND TEACHING STRATEGY THAT IS WELL SUPPORTED IN THE LITERATURE. BACK UP HERE ABLE TO ASSESS STUDENT NURSES COMPETENCY USING PERFORMANCE BASED INDICATORS IN CRITICAL AREAS OF NURSING PRACTICE. ANY INCREASE IN SIMULATION AS CLINICAL PRACTICE HOURS IT'S PART OF THE SOLUTION TO MITIGATE CALIFORNIA'S STATEWIDE REDUCTION IN CLINICAL PLACEMENT CAPACITY. WHICH CONTINUES TO BE A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM WITHOUT ANY SIGNS OF. GOING AWAY. THE CSU NURSING DIRECTORS THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM AGREE WITH THE NATIONAL COUNCIL STATE BOARD OF NURSING GUIDELINES A DIRECT PATIENT CARE AND STIMULATION CLINICAL HOURS MUST BE DATA DRIVEN AND THE S. U. S. B. N. PROVIDED RESEARCH FINDINGS THAT SUPPORT SIMULATION AS PART OF CLINICAL PRACTICE EXPERIENCES. THE NATIONAL COUNCIL ALSO REPORTED THAT 34% OF BOARDS OF NURSING THROUGHOUT THE NATION. USE 50% SIMULATION AS GUIDANCE FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE. OF NOTE OUR SCHOOLS FIRST TIME PASS RATE FOR THE AND CLICKS ARE AN EXAM HAVE REMAINED GREATER THAN EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT. DESPITE THE DECREASE CLINICAL HOURS AND INCREASED STIMULATION TIME DURING THE PANDEMIC. IT IS IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I WON'T GO INTO DETAIL BUT I WILL MERELY NOTE THAT. EXAMINATION OF OTHER AREAS RELATED TO REGULATION WOULD ASSIST IN THE TIMELY PLACEMENT OF STUDENTS. IN CLINICAL SITES- SPECIFICALLY LOOKING AT THE- REQUIREMENT FOR THE BEER INTO APPROVED CLINICAL SITES. AND THE REQUIREMENT FOR CONCURRENCY. INCREASING ELATION EXPERIENCE IS GRANTED THROUGH AB TWENTY TWO EIGHTY EIGHT ALLOW THE MAJORITY OF CSU NURSING STUDENTS TO PROGRESS IN A TIMELY MANNER THIS HELPED TO ADDRESS THE BOTTLENECK THAT WAS CREATED WHEN CLINICAL PLACEMENTS EAST. EVERY PRE LICENSURE. NURSING CAMPUS REQUIRED AND WAS GRANTED WAIVERS TO REDUCE DIRECT PATIENT CARE HOURS. THE VALLEY FOUNDATION SCHOOL OF NURSING AND THE OTHER STUDENTS TO SCHOOLS OF NURSING CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE CLINICAL DISPLACEMENT FROM SEVERAL CLINICAL PARTNERS. SINCE MARCH TWENTY TWENTY. WE CONTINUE TO HAVE DIFFICULTY IN SECURING CLINICAL SITES ESPECIALLY IN PSYCHIATRIC MENTAL HEALTH DESPITE ALLOWABLE 75% SIMULATION WAIVER. THIS NEEDS TO BE REMEDIED QUICKLY TO REDUCE THE BOTTLENECK IN PROGRESSION OF OUR STUDENTS. IF IRAN REGULATIONS RETURNED 275% DIRECT PATIENT CARE HOURS THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS PROGRESSING TO GRADUATION ON TIME WILL DECREASE EXPONENTIALLY. MEDICAL SURGICAL CLINICAL NURSING EXPERIENCES ARE NOW 250% DIRECT PATIENT CARE HOURS. PEDIATRICS OBSTETRICS AND MENTAL HEALTH ARE AT 25% SOME CLINICAL PLACEMENT OPPORTUNITIES HAVE OPENED BUT NOT TO THE EXTENT THAT WOULD ALLOW 75% OF DIRECT PATIENT CARE AND MEDICAL SURGICAL PLACEMENTS AT ALL CLINICAL SITES. IN CLOSING SOME CLINICAL PLACEMENT OPPORTUNITIES HAVE OPENED UP BUT NOT TO THE LEVELS WE SAW PRE PANDEMIC. AS A RESULT AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED THERE REMAINS A BOTTLENECK IN THE SYSTEM. I WOULD ENCOURAGE THIS BODY TO EMPHASIZE THE NEED FOR GREATER FLEXIBILITY. IN THE PROGRAM WHICH PROPERLY STRIKES A BALANCE BETWEEN THE NEED TO DELIVER QUALITY EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS AND THE NEED TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THAT YOU PROVIDED ME TODAY. AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. PROFESSOR BEFORE I MOVED TO THE NEXT PANELIST JUST TO. THE FOCUS ON THE PRE PANDEMIC PRIOR TO MARCH TWENTY TWENTY DID YOUR PROGRAM HAVE ANY DIFFICULTY SECURING CLINICAL PLACEMENTS PRIOR TO THE COVER NINETEEN. A PANDEMIC SITUATION. NOW WE DID NOT DO YOU KNOW WHETHER THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE NURSING PROGRAMS ASSUMING THERE ARE SOME- IN YOUR AREA HAD ANY PRE PAN PANDEMIC PROBLEMS SECURING CLINICAL PLACEMENTS. YES I AM AWARE OF A FEW OF OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE PARTNERS TO- HAD DIFFICULTY FINDING CLINICAL PLACEMENTS. JUST TO. HAVE A FRAME OF REFERENCE PRIOR TO THE COVERED NINETEEN PANDEMIC. IN YOUR AREA WAS THERE ANY EFFORT TO TRY TO GET TOGETHER OF YOUR PROGRAM THE PROPRIETARY PROGRAMS AT COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO ATTEMPT TO. COORDINATE THE CLINICAL PLACEMENT EFFORT. PREPEND DEMI. MAKE IT A WE DID NOT SPECIFICALLY MEET TO COORDINATE OUR CLINICAL SITE PLACEMENTS- WE MET TO SHARE FACULTY AND WE ALSO MET TO DISCUSS- THE RN TO BSN PROGRAM SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT WE WERE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT AROUND CONCURRENT ENROLLMENT PROGRAMS THAT WE DIDN'T NEED TO. CONSOLIDATE AT CLINICAL SITES. IN ONE FINAL QUESTION ON CLINICAL PLACEMENTS I MEAN OBVIOUSLY I SHOULD AS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES INVOLVED BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU KNOW DO YOU KNOW WHY WHAT THE DIFFICULTY WAS THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE NURSING PROGRAMS WERE. WERE HAVING IN SECURING CLINICAL PLACEMENTS THOSE IN YOUR PARTICULAR AREA. I CAN ONLY SPEAK FOR ONE. THAT WAS IN OUR AREA AND- IT WAS BECAUSE THE HOSPITAL WAS SEEKING THE BACHELOR'S PREPARED STUDENTS. OKAY WELL THANK YOU DON'T LEAVE WE PROBABLY WILL HAVE SOME MORE QUESTIONS AND GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO JUMP BACK IN. COLLEAGUES IN THE- ICY NONE SO LET'S MOVE TO OUR NEXT PANELIST RENEE SCHWEITZER VICE PRESIDENT UNIVERSITY RELATIONS WEST COAST UNIVERSITY THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ARE YOU ABLE TO HAR ME. PERFECTLY WITH ROUGHLY CRAIG- MY NAME IS RENEE SCHWEITZER AND I'M THE VICE PRESIDENT OF UNIVERSITY RELATIONS. FOR WEST COAST UNIVERSITY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT BEFORE YOU TODAY. LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR UNIVERSITY WCU HAS OFFERED EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE SINCE NINETEEN OH NINE. AND TODAY WCO IS A MAJOR SUPPLIER OF THE STATE'S BACHELOR. BACHELOR CREDENTIALED NURSING WORKFORCE WE HOLD NATIONAL REGIONAL ACCREDITATION FROM LOS SENIOR. AND THE COMMISSION ON COLLEGIATE NURSING EDUCATION. AND OUR GRADUATES CONSISTENTLY PLACE IN THE NINETIETH PERCENTILE FOR AND COLLECTS POSTAGE RATES. WE HAVE THREE CAMPUSES LOCATED LOS ANGELES ANAHEIM IN ONTARIO. 70% OF OUR STUDENTS IDENTIFY AS PEOPLE OF COLOR MANY OF OUR STUDENTSSPEAK A SECOND LANGUAGE LIVE IN MULTI GENERATIONAL HOUSEHOLDS AND ENTER OUR PROGRAMS LATER THAN IN TRADITIONAL SETTINGS THE AVERAGE AGE ACTUALLY FOR OUR STUDENTS FOR ON GROUND CAMPUSES IS BETWEEN TWENTY SIX AND TWENTY NINE. WCU IS PROUD OF THE RICH CULTURAL DIVERSITY OF OUR STUDENTS ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE DISCUSSIONS THAT OUR STATE IS HAVING RIGHT NOW REGARDING EQUITY IN HEALTHCARE AND INCREASING THE DIVERSITY IN OUR NURSING WORKFORCE. IN MY ROLE AS VICE PRESIDENT OF UNIVERSITY RELATIONS I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSEEING ALL CLINICAL PLACEMENTS AS WELL AS PERFORMING ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS NECESSARY. FOR B. RN ACCREDITOR CLINICAL SITE COMPLIANCE. I DO WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR CAMPUS SCENES OF NURSING TO ENSURE THAT EACH OF OUR CLINICAL EXPERIENCES ARE ABLE TO MEET COURSE OBJECTIVES. AND ARE WITHIN THE ARE IN SCOPE OF PRACTICE THAT YOU HEARD ABOUT. I BRING WITH ME TO THIS ROLE MY EXPERIENCE AS A FORMER STUDENT. MY I'M THE FIRST IN MY FAMILY TO GO TO COLLEGE I EARNED MY ADN DEGREE AT ANTELOPE VALLEY COMMUNITY COLLEGE MY MASTERS AND FMP DEGREES AT CSU DOMINGUEZ HILLS. AND THEN FINALLY LOOK UP MUCH LATER IN LIFE MY DOCTOR OF NURSING PRACTICE AT CHAMBERLAIN. AS A PRACTICING NURSE A SPECIALIZED IN THE OPERATING ROOM. I DO KNOW FIRST HAND HOW VITAL THESE CLINICAL EDUCATION EXPERIENCES THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING OUR FOR STUDENTS. AS THEY TRANSITION INTO PRACTICE TO ENSURE HEALTHY PATIENT OUTCOMES. SECURING CLINICAL ROTATIONS PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC WAS INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT REGIONAL CONSORTIUM AND OTHER THIRD PARTY SCHEDULING VENDORS. THEY ONLY HAVE INFORMATION FOR THE SITES THAT PARTICIPATE IN THAT PARTICULAR PLATFORM. W. C. DOES PARTICIPATE IN ALL LOCAL CONSORTIUMS THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT FROM MY FORMER PANEL MEMBERS AND WE ALSO COMPLETE THE B. R. AND REQUIREMENTS THAT PROTECT PROGRAMS FROM CLINICAL DISPLACEMENT. HOWEVER SCHOOL STILL MUST ENDEAVOR TO DO THEIR OWN RESEARCH WHICH TAKES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME. DID YOU SEE YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIND OPPORTUNITIES BEYOND THE POPULAR MOST STOCK MOST SOUGHT AFTER CLINICAL ROTATIONS IN ACUTE CARE SETTINGS. WE HAVE FOUND ROTATIONS OF FACILITIES SUCH AS HOME HEALTH- ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HOSPICE. HAVE YOU SEE YOU IS WERE ALSO VERY FLEXIBLE IN SCHEDULING RESTRAINTS- WE OFTEN TAKE EVENING AND WEEKEND ROTATIONS OTHER PROGRAMS CANNOT ACCOMMODATE. ABOUT APPROXIMATELY 30% OF OUR CLINICAL PLACEMENTS MARTIN ON A Q. CARE SETTINGS AND APPROXIMATELY 35% ARE ON EVENINGS AND WEEKENDS. AS WE SLOWLY RECOVER FROM THIS PANDEMIC CLINICAL SITES ARE CAUTIOUS TO READMIT STUDENTS AS YOU'VE HEARD I HAVE SOME DATA ON THAT AND TO DATE HAVE YOU SEE YOU HAS ONLY REGAIN FORTY PERCENT. OF OUR PRE COATED ROTATIONS HOWEVER WE'VE BEEN THANKFUL TO USE A TEMPORARY INCREASE IN SIMULATION AND OTHER PROVISIONS OF AB TWENTY TWO EIGHTY EIGHT. BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER LOVE TO CONTINUE TO PROGRESS STUDENTS FOR ON TIME GRADUATION. WE DO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO EASE EASE THE DEMAND FOR ROTATIONS- WOULD BE TO PERMANENTLY INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF SIMULATION- THAT IS COOL CAN USE TO ACHIEVE THEIR OBJECTIVES. AS YOU HAVE ALREADY HEARD AND YOU WILL PROBABLY CONTINUE TO HEAR FROM MY COLLEAGUES ON THE PANEL THAT SIN IS A PROVEN MODALITY FOR TEACHING CRITICAL COMPETENCIES. WCU IS A LEADER IN THE USE OF STEM. AND IS ONE OF ONLY EIGHT CALIFORNIA COLLEGES THAT HOLDS AN EDUCATION PROGRAM ACCREDITATION. OUR STATUS IS CURRENTLY PROVISIONAL AND WE WILL APPLY FOR FULL APPROVAL THIS DECEMBER. ONCE FULLY APPROVED OUR STUDENT OUTCOMES IN THE SYSTEM WILL ONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO RESEARCH AND PUBLICATIONS. TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ALL OUR PROGRAMS ARE TOP PRIORITY. AND ONE MORE SOLUTION THAT COULD SUPPORT PROGRESSION AND GRADUATION IS TO ALIGN THE ARE AN OVERSIGHT WITH OUR PROFESSIONAL ACCREDITATION REQUIREMENTS. AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE TO THE FIRST OF SANTA CHANGES INCLUDING A ROMAN FACULTY APPROVALS CURRICULUM CHANGES EXCEPT FOR TO THE PROFESSIONAL ACCREDITOR. AGAIN THANK YOU THANKS SO MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE TO BE SEIZE PERSON W. C. USE PERSPECTIVE ON THE OUTLOOK FOR CLINICAL PLACEMENTS. AND EDUCATION I AM PREPARED TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE FOR ME ON THIS TOPIC INTO INVITE ALL OF YOU AND YOUR STAFF TO ONE OF OUR CAMPUSES ACTUALLY VIEW WHAT SIMULATION LABS LOOK LIKE IN ACTION. AND MEET WITH OUR FACULTY AND STUDENTS THANK YOU. PERHAPS JUST ONE QUESTION AND THEN I'LL- TRY TO MAKE SURE I MOVE ON AND THEN FOLLOW UP. WITH MY COLLEAGUES IN THE SECOND BUT- CAN SOMEONE. CAN SOMEONE ADDRESS THE COST OF. ELATION MISS WRITERS INSURER AND WEST COAST AND IT'S A PROPRIETARY SCHOOL- MAYBE YOU WOULD BE MORE A QUICK TO ANSWER THAT WE'VE GOT PUBLIC SCHOOLS BOTH COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY THAT MAY HAVE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE AND DIFFERENT FINANCIAL OUTLOOK BUT CAN YOU TALK TO ME ABOUT THE COST OF SIMULATION. FOR A NEW PROGRAM I DO NOT HAVE THE EXACT COST I DO KNOW ONE PANELISTS WHO WILL KNOW AND SHE'S FOLLOWING ME KT WAXMAN WHO ACTUALLY HELPED US. WITH THAT BUT IT ALSO DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF SIMULATOR THAT ARE. METAPHYSICALLY CHEESE TWO YEARS THERE ARE THERE ARE MANICHAEANS IF YOU WILL THAT ARE KNOWN AS HIGH FIDELITY THAT HAVEN'T INCREASED COSTS AND THEY ACTUALLY DO MORE- THEY SIMULATE MORE OF A LIFE WITH A LIVE PERSON. CAN DO- AND THERE'S ALSO LOW FIDELITY MANIKINS WHICH ARE WERE ALSO USED UP PRIMARILY IN SKILLS CLASS WHAT A ME TO PUT YOU ON THE SPOT THAT THE- WHAT DOES THAT THE- THING. INTO ME AS WELL. IS WAXMAN. ZERO THANK YOU VERY MUCH- FOR THE INVITATION I AM K&lt;c.cyan&gt; WAXMAN I'M THE&lt;/c&gt; DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA SIMULATION ALLIANCE WHICH IS A PROGRAM OF HEALTH IMPACT I AM A DOCTOR LEE PREPARED REGISTERED NURSE PRACTICING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR ALMOST FOUR DECADES NOW. I BILLION SIMULATIONS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE. AND I AM FULL TIME FACULTY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN FRANCISCO I AM ALSO A PAST PRESIDENT FOR THE SOCIETY FOR SIMULATION IN HEALTHCARE. THERE ARE DECADES OF SIMULATION STUDIES AND EVIDENCE ON THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY ON PREPARATION OF NURSES PHYSICIANS FIRST RESPONDERS FIREFIGHTERS AND AIRLINE PILOTS. CURRENTLY THERE ARE EIGHTEEN STATES IN WHICH BOARDS OF NURSING HAVE APPROVED THE USE A STATES THAT ARE AT 30% AND SEVEN STATES AT 25% THE REMAINING TWENTY FOUR STATES HAVE NO RETURN REGULATIONS ON THE USE OF SIMULATION. THERE ARE STANDARDS AVAILABLE FOR SIMULATION FROM BOTH THE INTERNATIONAL NURSING ASSOCIATION FOR CLINICAL SIMULATION AND LEARNING AND THE SOCIETY FOR SIMULATION IN HEALTHCARE. ADOPTION OF THE I'M AXLE STANDARDS OF BEST PRACTICE SIMULATION DEMONSTRATED COMMITMENT. TO QUALITY AND IMPLEMENTATION OF RIGOROUS EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES IN HEALTH CARE EDUCATION TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE BY COMPLYING WITH PRACTICE STANDARDS THERE ARE EIGHT. SANDERS THAT ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING AREAS. SIMULATION DESIGN OUTCOMES AND OBJECTIVES FACILITATION DEBRIEFING PARTICIPANTE VALUATION PROFESSIONAL INTEGRITY STIMULATION ENHANCED INTER PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION AND OPERATIONS THE NINTH IS ALMOST- AVAILABLE AND THAT'S FUNDS PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. THE SOCIETY FOR SIMULATION IN HEALTHCARE ACCREDITATION PROGRAM EXAMINES SIMULATION PROGRAMS PROCESSES AND OUTCOMES IN ASSESSMENT RESEARCH TEACHING EDUCATION AND SYSTEMS INTEGRATION. AND AS MENTIONED EARLIER WE HAVE EIGHT SCHOOLS THAT ARE ACCREDITED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THERE'S ALSO A CERTIFICATION THAT IS AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SOCIETY FOR FACULTY TO FOSTER EXCELLENCE IN HEALTHCARE SIMULATION AND TO PROMOTE CONFIDENCE RECOGNITION AND DEVELOPMENT OF HEALTHCARE SIMULATION S. THREE STANDARDS AND PROCESSES FOR CERTIFICATION WITHIN THE GLOBAL HEALTH CARE SIMULATION COMMUNITY. WITH CALIFORNIA'S SIMULATION ALLIANCE RECOMMENDS THAT FACULTY LEADING AND TEACHING IN SIMULATION WORK TOWARDS CERTIFICATION. SOME STATES ARE NOW REQUIRING THE CERTIFICATION IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF STIMULATION 250% RECENTLY A CONSORTIUM OF FOUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA UTILIZE THE CALIFORNIA SIMULATION ALLIANCE THROUGH A GRANT TO TRAIN OVER THE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FACULTY IN SIMULATION. FACULTY ARE EAGER TO BE EDUCATED ON THIS METHODOLOGY. SIMULATION IS NOT ALL MANNA CAN BET BASED AND IT IS NOT ALL EXPENSIVE. SIMULATION CAN BE ROLE PLAY STANDARDIZED PATIENTS HYBRID LOW FIDELITY OR HIGH FIDELITY MANNEQUINS COMPUTER BASED OR VIRTUAL REALITY. WE CAN GUARANTEE A CLINICAL EXPERIENCE IN SIMULATION BUT WE CANNOT IN THE CLINICAL SETTING A STUDENTS ARE OFTEN NOT. ONLY ALLOWED TO OBSERVE AND MAYBE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EVEN GIVE MEDICATIONS FOR CHART IN THE MEDICAL RECORD. IN THE TWENTY TWENTY A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE THAT INVESTIGATED THE IMPACT OF IN PERSON CLINICAL ROTATIONS ON LEARNING OUTCOMES THE AUTHORS. COULD NOT FIND ANY STUDIES LINKED IN PERSON CLINICAL THAT LINKED IN PERSON CLINICAL ROTATIONS TO ACHIEVING LEARNING OUTCOMES RESULTING IN AN EMPTY REVIEW. ALSO A RECENT STUDY JUST PUBLISHED THIS MONTH WAS ONE OF THE FIRST STUDIES TO QUANTIFY THE QUALITY AND SAFETY OF NEW GRADUATE NURSES THAT WAS CONDUCTED PRE PANDEMIC. THE STUDY FOUND THAT 1100% OF NEW GRADUATES MADE ERRORS AND FAILED TO RESCUE THEIR PATIENTS HOWEVER THE RESEARCHERS USED AN ONLINE SIMULATION PROGRAM TO IMPROVE THE CLINICAL REASONING AND DECISION MAKING AND THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE QUALITY AND SAFETY OF THE NEW GRADS. THIS IS A CONCRETE EXAMPLE OF SIMULATION OF THE VALUE OF SAM. IN CONCLUSION WE NEED TO USE SCIENCE BASED TEACHING AND LEARNING METHODS POST PANDEMIC AND NOT GO BACK TO THE WAY WE WERE PREPEND EMMETT AS WE HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH OVER THE PAST YEAR AND WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO APPLY. EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE ACCORDINGLY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU MA'AM COULD YOU MAYBE YOU MENTIONED IT AND I MISSED TO SPEAK ABOUT THE COST OF SIMULATION HOW DOES THAT DOES THAT VERY AND IF SO. HOW. FIRST OF ALL THE COST OF SIMULATION- VARIES SIGNIFICANTLY ON WHAT- TYPE OF EQUIPMENT THAT YOU WOULD WOULD PURCHASE AND SOME OF THE US I THINK EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE SCHOOLS IN THE STATE HAS SOME SORT OF EQUIPMENT. AND IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE WHEN WE BEGAN OVER TRAINING THE REASON WE DID THE TRAINING WAS THROUGH A GRANT BECAUSE EVERYONE HAD STIMULATORS AND AT THAT TIME WE WERE VERY FOCUSED ON THIS MANNEQUIN. OVER TIME WE REALIZED THE MANNEQUIN IS ONLY ONE TYPE OF STIMULATION. AND THOSE AMERICANS RANGING IN PRICE FROM TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND TWO MAYBE A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES WHAT TYPE OF. HELLO G. MODALITY DO WE NEED FOR OUR STUDENTS TO ACHIEVE THE LEARNING OUTCOMES IN AN I SEE YOU FOR AN UNKNOWN ANASTASIA ENVIRONMENT YOU MIGHT NEED A VERY VERY HIGH FIDELITY EXPENSIVE AMERICAN BUT IN A PRE LICENSURE COMMUNITY COLLEGE YOU MAY NEED A MIDDLE LEVEL. MANNIKIN AND SOME STANDARDIZED PATIENTS AND IT CAN BE DETERMINED TO BE A RESOURCE ALLOCATION AND YOUR BUDGET AND THE LEARNING OUTCOMES NOT BY THE EQUIPMENT. WELL IT SEEMS SPEAK THE STANDARDS AND TO THE POINT THAT WE DON'T HAVE STANDARDS- OR IF WE DO. IF WE DON'T HAVE STANDARDS WHAT STANDARD SHOULD BE SAID AND IF WE DO HOW SHOULD OUR STANDARDS BE REVISED IN WHO SHOULD DO IT. RIGHT WELL THEY'RE ALREADY STANDARDS OUT THERE AS I MENTIONED AND OUR OUR OUR GROUP WITH- HAS RECOMMENDED- TO THE NURSING EDUCATION- WORKFORCE ADVISORY COMMITTEE. TO RECOMMEND AND IMPLEMENT STANDARDS AT ALL SCHOOLS WHO ARE DOING SIMULATION. SO THAT THEY COULD CAN- INSURE QUALITY I'M NOT ONLY OF THE SINGING RELATIONS THEMSELF AND SAFETY OF THE STUDENTS WHILE THEY'RE IN THE- SIMULATION ALL FACULTY NEED TO BE TRAINED. AND FOLLOW. THE STANDARDS THAT ARE ALREADY IN IN- HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN THE IN THE IN THE WORLD OR GLOBAL STANDARDS. OKAY WELL WE'LL THANK YOU LET ME- LET ME JUST THROW THIS QUESTION OUT THAN TO THE- DIRECTORS OF THE PUBLIC NURSING PROGRAMS. A COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY IF THE BOARD CHANGED THE RULES- THE SIMULATION RULES. ON A GO FORWARD BASIS- WOULD YOU FACE ANY OTHER OBSTACLES TO INCREASED USE OF SIMULATION IF SO WHAT OBSTACLES AND HOW CAN WE HELP ADDRESS THOSE. MAN DRESSED UP THIS IS A ALL THIS MONTH IN AMERICA- AS FOR TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE YOU KNOW THE STANDARD SO GREAT TO IMPLEMENT WHAT ARE CHALLENGES IN OUR BARRIERS ARE NOT JUST THE EQUIPMENT ALONE. BECAUSE YES THE LIST OF DOCTOR BLACKMAN IS CORRECT THERE ARE VARIOUS TYPES OF SIMULATORS THAT ARE TO SIMULATORS MANICKAM BASED AND THEN THERE'S A VIRTUAL RELITY AT. WHERE IT'S ALL AUGMENTED AND SO WITH THAT BEING SAID THERE STILL IS A HOT. AND FOR ME PERSONALLY TRYING TO UPDATE MY PROGRAM WHICH HAS FALLEN BACK IN TEN YEARS BECAUSE OF RESOURCE ISSUES- THE CHALLENGE OF TRYING TO FIND THOSE RESOURCES AM I SUPPOSED TO WRITE A GRANT FOR EVERY MANNEQUIN THAT I BUY TO LIVE BY IN LITTLE PIECES EVERY YEAR. THAT'S ONE CHALLENGE SECOND CHALLENGE IS TO FIND A FACULTY QUALIFIED FACULTY WHO'S WILLING TO BE TRAINED IN SIMULATION BECAUSE NOT ALL FACULTY WANTS TO DISSIMULATION ESPECIALLY THE CONCEPT THAT YOU. SEE SO TRYING TO RESOURCE THOSE TWO ITEMS OUR BEAR YEARS IN OUR WORLD IN THE. PUBLIC STATE FUNDED PROGRAM. SO OF IT'S A IS AND SOME OF IT TO ME ISSUE. IT IS. AND THEN JUST OF- AND WE DON'T ASK TO. AND IF THE TWO I KNOW I JUST TRY TO SEND SOMEBODY. HER OF THE CALIFORNIA SIMULATION ALLIANCE TRAINING. AND THAT COST NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER PERSON SO IF I HAVE TWENTY FIVE THAT MEANS NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS TIMES TWENTY. PLUS THEIR TIME THAT THEY SPEND IN THAT TRAINING. ZERO YES A LOT OF IT THERE'S A LOT OF ENCOMPASSING THINGS WE WOULD LOVE TO DO 50% SIMULATION BUT PLEASE HELP US WITH THE STATE COMMUNITY COLLEGES WITH THIS POLITICAL DISPLACEMENT ISSUE HOW CAN WE MAKE THIS HAPPEN FOR OUR COMMUNITY STUDENTS WHO CANNOT AFFORD A HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLAR TUITION BUT CAN AFFORD ARE SIX THOUSAND DOLLAR TUITION BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE CUTS THE NURSES. WHO ARE LIVING IN THE COMMUNITY AS A DOCTOR CHEN HAD MENTIONED EARLIER STATE DUMA FITS WITHIN FIFTY MILES OF THE SCHOOL. EVERY DAY WILL FORGET MY COMMUNITY SO TO ADDRESS THE OTHER LEGISLATORS QUESTION ABOUT THAT ONE LPN IN THE BAKERSFIELD AREA WELL IF YOU HAVE MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO ENROLL STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THESE RESOURCES AND TO TRAIN STUDENTS WITH 50% OF SIMULATION MAYBE PERHAPS WE WILL BE ABLE TO ENROLL MORE STUDENTS AND ADDRESS THEM THAT THEY'LL BE AND THAT'S TRYING TO GET INTO NURSING SCHOOL. AND THAT WILL OFFSET SOME OF THE CLINICAL DIRECTOR PLACEMENTS THAT WE HAVE AMPLE SCOPE WITH I HAVE TALKED TO ALL THE HOSPITALS THEY ARE NOT GOING TO GIVE US ACCESS TO ALL THE PATIENTS THAT WE HAD CREE COVE IT. AND SO THE DATA LANDSCAPE ALONE AS DIRECT CARE PATIENTS- OF DIRECT PATIENT CARE WILL CHANGE FOR OUR SENIORS AND STUDENTS TO BE PREPARED AND TRAINED APPROPRIATELY SO TO CLOSE THAT GAP WE DO HAVE TO HAVE SOME RELATION OF SOME SORT. TO ADDRESS THE GAPS THAT EVENTUALLY WILL COST A SAFETY. ISSUE TO OUR PUBLIC. IF WE DON'T TRAIN THEM WELL. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE REST BEFORE I TURNED THE CALIFORNIA STATE- MEMBER ME ASK YOU OTHER ARE A POINT OF THE ARE THERE ANY SPECIFIC RESTRICTIONS ON YOUR CLINICAL PLACEMENT OPPORTUNITIES AS THEY AS A PUBLIC PUBLICLY FUNDED NURSING SCHOOL SUCH AS- PLACEMENT DISTANCE FROM SCHOOL TO PLACEMENT OPPORTUNITY AT CETERA ANY ANY ANY OTHER BARRIERS TO. PARTICIPATING IN CLINICAL PLACEMENTS BESIDES THE WILLINGNESS OF THE OF THE- TRAINING FACILITY TO HAVE SIGNED AN AGREEMENT WITH YOU. WELL THIS IS A TRAINING AGREEMENT- I MEAN THE TRAINING AFFILIATION AGREEMENT I MUST SAY SOME OF THE BARRIERS ARE JUST ACCESS TO QUALITY FACULTY. AND ACCESS TO GOOD QUALITY CLINICAL PLACEMENTS READ THE NOT HAVE THAT RESOURCE AS SOME OTHER SCHOOLS MAY HAVE- UP TO HELP THE FACILITY WITH OTHER THINGS THEN. TRAINING OUR STUDENTS WE REALLY DULL AND. AND RIGHT NOW. THE DOOR SORT ARE BEING CLOSE ON US FOR BEING VERY SELECTIVE FONG ON THE PUBLIC STATE FUNDED ESPECIALLY THE SOCIO DEGREE PROGRAMS JUST BECAUSE THEY PREFER THE BADGERS PREPARE FOR SAYS ALTHOUGH THEY KNOW THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE GOING INTO VENTURES DEGREE PROGRAM. PROGRAM AND THE THIRD SEMESTER WHEN THEY ARE STILL VERY DISCRIMINATORY SO I MUST SAY MY PROGRAM DIRECTOR THERE'S A TIRED. AT THE HEART OF BOYS BOMBING YOU HAVE TO SINK QUALITYEDUCATION S. THE OTHER. SCHOOLS CAN HAVE REPORTED. MY QUESTION REAL WENT TO EXAMPLE IF IT IT I DON'T. IF YOU WERE ABLE TO SECURE REPLACEMENT FOR EXAMPLE AN ACUTE PLACERS THE PLACEMENTS OF THE CUTE CARE FACILITY THAT WAS LOCATED SEVENTY FIVE MILES. FROM YOUR SCHOOL OR SIXTY MILES FROM YOUR- CLASSROOM. IS THAT A BARRIER TO PARTICIPATION AND IF SO HOW ARE OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS UNLESS IT IS AN OVERALL AREA AND I'VE WORKED WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN THE RURAL AREA SUCH AS BLYTH AND OTHER AREAS OF CALIFORNIA BUT A FAR AWAY WHEN DRIVING AT A HUNDRED MILES TO THE NEAREST HOSPITAL IS A COMMON THING. BUT IN IN THE METROPOLITAN AREA ANYTHING ABOVE FIFTY MILES IS A ALREADY A STRETCH FOR ME COLLEGE STUDENTS THESE ARE STUDENTS WHO ARE BARELY MAKING AN INCOME AND TRYING TO GO INTO A NURSING PROGRAM SO THEY CAN CHANGE THEIR LIVES LIKE IDEAS AND BEING ABLE TO. OPEN THEMSELVES TO A NEW CAREER TO GET TO HAVE THAT GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT SO YES THE HAVING ãNSPORTATION THE LOAN IS A CHALLENGE DURING THIS PANDEMIC OUR STUDENTS AND EVEN HAVE COMPUTERS TO BE ONLINE TO COMPLETE THEIR EDUCATION ONLINE THAT'S WHAT WE WOULD DISBURSING COMPUTERS WE WERE GIVING REFUNDS ON SEVERAL THINGS AND WE EVEN TRIED TO OFFSET THEIR TEXTBOOKS AND OTHER LEARNING RESOURCES THROUGH OTHER OPPORTUNITIES AND MEANS. THAT THE STATE HAS PROVIDED FOR US SO YES THOSE ARE CHAIRED CHALLENGES AND BARRIERS TO DRIVE TO THAT LATE HOURS TO BE ABLE TO CALL TO MAKE SURE FOR CLINICAL ROTATIONS. THANK YOU WITH OVER KELLY SAYING QUESTIONS IF THE BEER AND CHANGE THE RULES TOMORROW ON A GO FORWARD BASIS WOULD THE CAL STATE FACE ANY OBSTACLES IN YOUR VIEW TOWARD INCREASED USE OF SIMULATION. BEYOND WHAT YOU'RE ABLE TO DO NOW. NO I WOULD BE JUST IT WOULD NICE TO HAVE THAT FLEX. ESPECIALLY IN A WERE WE HAVE MUCH. WITH PLAY. I MEAN I'M NOT IS A CLINICAL SIMULATION DOES NOT REPLACE DIRECT CARE WE ALL ARE AWARE OF THAT. BUT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IN SITUATIONS WHERE WE NEED IT LIKE IT'S LIKE MENTAL HEALTH. I DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET ENOUGH SITES FOR FALL SO IT WOULD BE NICE TO CONTINUE WITH THAT. 75% SIMULATION 25% DIRECT HERE BUT OF COURSE IF WE ARE ABLE TO- YOU KNOW I HAVE SITES FOR MEDICAL SURGICAL NURSING WE WOULD. WE WOULD WANT TO HAVE THE HIGHEST THAT WE WERE ABLE TO HELP FOR DIRECT CARE HOURS. IN TERMS OF COST IT HASN'T REALLY BEEN AN ISSUE IT IS DOCTOR WAXMAN MENTION. SIMULATIONS CHANGED OVER THE PAST TWELVE YEARS OR SO. YEAH IT'S NOT ALL AMERICAN BASED AND- WHEN THE PANDEMIC FIRST HIT IN MARCH OF TWENTY WE HAD TO JUMP TO REMOTE. LEARNING FOR OUR CLASSROOMS AND WE ALSO JUMPED TO REMOTE. AN ONLINE SIMULATION THAT WORKED ACTUALLY REALLY REALLY WELL. AND WHICH THOSE PRODUCTS THAT WE HAVE. FOR ONLINE SIMULATION. WE CAN ACTUALLY. SERVE THOSE WHO ARE REMOTE FROM FAR AWAY- AND YOU CAN HAVE THEM PARTICIPATE IN SIMULATION FROM A DISTANCE SO. THERE'S A LOT OF OPTIONS OUT THERE THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND- IT WOULD JUST BE NICE TO HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY. YOU KNOW AS EDUCATORS WE KNOW WHAT'S BEST FOR STUDENTS. AND WE CERTAINLY WOULDN'T WANT TO. NOT HAVE A HAVE CLINICAL EXPERIENCE WHEN IT WAS AVAILABLE. THANK YOU FOR THAT THE RESPONSE MAYBE I'LL ASK- EVERYONE TO JUMP IN AT THIS POINT ANYONE WHO STILL ON THE LINE LET ME ASK. ONE I THINK FINAL QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH CLINICAL PLACEMENTS YOU KNOW- GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE NEED MORE NURSES AT LEAST I THINK THAT'S BEEN ESTABLISHED. CERTAINLY IN SOME PARTS OF THE STATE FOR SURE AND PERHAPS POST COVERED IN EVEN MORE PARTS OF THE STATE- WHAT CAN WE DO. WHETHER IT'S THE B. R. N. OR ANY OF THE REST OF YOU ON THE LINE WHAT CAN WE DO TO DEAL WITH THIS CLINICAL PLACEMENT ISSUE. ROSS THE BOARDS SO WE ENSURE THAT. OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE NURSING PROGRAMS IN THE STUDENTS IN THOSE PROGRAMS THE STUDENTS IN OUR- CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. SYSTEM PROGRAMS- STUDENTS AND OTHER. PUBLIC INSTITUTION PROGRAMS IN THE STATE AND CERTAINLY ARE- A NOT FOR PROFIT AND PROFIT TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR STUDENTS. WERE ABLE TO SECURE THE CLINICAL PLACEMENTS THAT THEY NEED IN ORDER TO. FINISH PROGRAMS AND- SECURE A LICENSURE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ANY TAKERS- I'D LIKE I'D LIKE TO MAKE A FEW COMMENTS AND IF I MAY- I THINK ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS WOULD BE TO ALLOW THE SCHOOLS. THAT HAVE. RESOURCES AND HAVE TRAINED FACULTY- TO MOVE 250% BECAUSE THEY ARE FOLLOWING THE STANDARDS. IN THE MEANTIME WITH FUNDING FOR THE OTHERS. TO GET MORE FOLKS TRAINED AND THEN MOVED TO THE FIFTY PERCENT. I ALSO WANT TO REITERATE THAT THE INS SIMULATION WE CAN GUARANTEE A CLINICAL EXPERIENCE. IF WE NEED OUR STUDENTS TO. LEARN ABOUT- CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE AND THAT PATIENT ISN'T AVAILABLE IN THE CLINICAL SETTING. AND THEY DON'T GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO- CARE FOR THAT PATIENT WE CAN SET UP A SCENARIO IN SIMULATION TO GUARANTEE THOSE EXPERIENCES. AND I THINK ABOUT WHAT'S WHAT A BIG DIFFERENCE IS NOW AS IT WAS TWENTY THIRTY YEARS AGO. WE WHEN PATIENTS WERE IN FOR A LONG TIME IN A HOSPITAL. WE CAN NOW- GUARANTEE THAT. THAT EXPERIENCE IN SIMULATION AND NOT WORRY ABOUT THEM NOT GETTING THAT EXPERIENCE IN A HOSPITAL SETTING. SO THAT WOULD BE MY FIRST SUGGESTION IS THAT THE SCHOOLS AND LIKE- DOCTOR ALERT KELLY SCHOOL WHO HAVE TRANSACTION TO RESOURCES. ALLOW THEM THE FLEXIBILITY TO MOVE HELP GET EVERYONE ELSE IN THE STATE TRAINED. TO- MEET THOSE STANDARDS ONE BEFORE I. REALLY LOWER RIVER DEALS TO ON. PILOTA I COULD SAY. DO WE HAVE ANY REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT THE MOVE 250% SIMULATION WOULD SOLVE THE CLINICAL PLACEMENT ISSUE. SENATOR ROB THIS IS LAURIE FROM THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING I CAN PROVIDE SOME INSIGHT INTO THAT THANK YOU- HOPING YOU JUMP IN HERE. THANK YOU WELL I'VE BEEN WAITING PATIENTLY I WANTED EVERYBODY ELSE HAVE A CHANCE TO SPEAK- YOU KNOW I STUDIED UNDER KßT WAXMAN- BACK IN TWENTY TEN I TOOK SUMMER COURSES AND- WHEN I WAS ENROLLED IN A PHD PROGRAM MY DISSERTATION IS GONNA BE A SIMULATION. HOWEVER-MY MOM FELL ILL AND I HAD TO DROP OUT SO I HAVE NOT YET FINISHED WITH THAT THAT'S IN THE FUTURE. IF WE ARE AND ESTABLISHES MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS. RIGHT NOW THAT WE ARE IN A SILENCE ON SIMULATION WE DON'T HAVE ANY REGULATIONS OVERSTIMULATION SO IN FACT OUR SCHOOLS CAN DO WHATEVER THEY WANT. WITH THOSE HOURS THAT ARE NOT IN DIRECT PATIENT CARE AND DO SIMULATION IT THE ABILITY TO SUPPORT THAT THEY CAN ALSO DO OTHER LEARNING MODALITIES THAT MEET THEIR CLINICAL OBJECTIVES. I THINK THAT WE ARE IN FROM BIARRITZ PERSPECTIVE THE GOAL IS TO ESTABLISH A MINIMUM CRITERIA. RIGHT NOW NCSP AND WHO WAS ON THAT CALL IS DOING A STUDY. BIERSTADT WISHING MINIMUM. DIRECT PATIENT CARE HOURS. I BELIEVE BY. TO THE PEOPLE C-SPAN THAT BABEL THAT DATA OUT TO US AS SOON AS THIS FALL. THAT DATA IF THEY STATE THAT THE MINIMUM DIRECT PATIENT CARE HOURS ARE FIVE HUNDRED THEN I THINK CALIFORNIA CAN MOVE TOWARDS ESTABLISHING A MINIMUM DIRECT PATIENT CARE HOURS OF FIVE HUNDRED. AND THEN THE SCHOOLS CAN DO AS MUCH SIMULATION ABOVE THAT AS THEY CHOOSE TO DO SCHOOLS THAT HAVE THE ABILITY 225% CAN BE 25% SCHOOL THAT ABILITY TO THE 550% CAN DO FIFTY PERCENT. SCHOOLS HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO 75% CAN DO 75% WHAT WE ESTABLISH IS A DIRECT PATIENT CARE OUR AND WE STAY SILENT ON SIMULATION SO THAT THE VARIOUS PEOPLE THAT STAND BY THEIR SIMULATION STANDARDS. AND THEIR ABILITY TO SUPPORT THE SIMULATION STANDARDS CAN MOVE FORWARD AND HAVE THEIR UNIQUE CRITERIA THAT MEANS THAT THERE REGIONAL NEEDS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NCSP UNSTEADY ON 50% SAM BAY ESTABLISHED SIX HUNDRED HOURS AS THE MINIMUM HOUR REQUIREMENT ON THAT STUDY SO IF WE COME IN ANYWHERE NEAR THERE WE'VE GOT THAT IF WE LOOK AT TODAY'S CURRENT ESTABLISHED NUMBERS. WE MEET THAT WE ARE AT. OR BELOW SIX HUNDRED HOURS IN A REQUIREMENT ON A RIDICULOUSLY ELABORATE- THE EQUATION IN OUR REGULATIONS THAT WE SHOULD REALLY BE PROACTIVE AND FIX- INNER APR AND RAISED IN FOURTEEN EIGHTY FOUR WE STATE FIVE HUNDRED DIRECT PATIENT CARE HOURS FOR NURSE PRACTITIONERS. I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CALIFORNIA CAN CONSIDER WHEN LOOKING AT IT IS JUST STATE YOU KNOW FIVE HUNDRED HOURS DIRECT PATIENT CARE HOURS AND THEN BE DONE- THAT ALLOWS FOR THAT FLEXIBILITY THAT ALLOWS FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES IF THEY DON'T HAVE FUNDING FOR SIMULATION. THEY MEET THE FIVE HUNDRED HOURS THEY'RE DONE THEY WALK IF YOU DO HAVE A FACILITY THAT HAS THE ABILITY TO SUPPORT SIMULATION THEN THEY CAN DO A SIMULATION ON TOP OF WHAT WE STATUS AS A STANDARD FOR LICENSE. ANOTHER THING THAT IT BECAME REALLY AFFECT. THE CLINICAL PLACEMENTS. IS THE B. R. ESTABLISHES MINIMUM OF UNITS WE HAVE EIGHT YEAR THAT WORK. FOR THE TOLD PROGRAM TO BE DINING IN CLINICAL. WE ONLY HAVE OF SMALL PORTION OF STUDENTS OF SORRY ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS THAT MEET THAT MINIMUM SEVERAL AND I'M I'M TRYING TO STRESS THAT WORDS SEVERAL GO ABOVE THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR AB AND PROGRAMS. THIRTY OF THE NINETY ONE MEET EIGHTEEN UNITS THE REST ARE ABOVE THE EIGHTEEN UNITS IF WE LOOK AT RBS SAID FIVE OF THE FORTY ONE MEET OUR MINIMUM THE RESTAURANT BOB THE MINIMUM. WE LOOK AT OUR ENTRY LEVEL MASTER'S FIVE MEET THE MINIMUM. OF THE TWELVE THE REST ARE ABOVE WHEN YOU LOOK AT ONE UNITS THAT'S IN EXCESS OF THE B. R. IN REQUIREMENTS THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL FORTY EIGHT HOURS THAT THAT STUDENT IS OUT IN THE CLINICAL SETTING. YOU MULTIPLY THAT BY A HUNDRED STUDENTS WHICH IS AT YOU KNOW SOME DIFFICULT MOMENTS FOR SOME OF OUR SCHOOLS. THAT'S FOUR THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED HOURS IN A CLINICAL SETTING THAT IS NOT REQUIRED BY THE B. R. AND- SO I THINK OUR SCHOOLS. AS MENTIONED BEFORE OKAY STANDARD CURRICULUM WITH WE DID A INIMUM REQUIREMENTS. AND THAT'S ALL THAT THEY MET. THEN IT AND THEN WE ESTABLISHED A MINIMUM DIRECT PATIENT CARE WITH ABSENT IN SILENT LIKE WE CURRENTLY AREN'T REGULATIONS SILENCE ON THE SIMULATION. I THINK WE CAN MAKE A HUGE MOVES AND HAVEN'T AND EQUITABLE SOLUTION FOR OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND OUR PRIVATE COLLEGES- ARE EIGHTY AND AS WELL AS OUR B. S. SENATE ELN BECAUSE AGAIN WE DON'T HAVE TO BE AROUND ESTABLISH GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS. WE ESTABLISHED LICENSE REQUIREMENTS WHICH IS MUCH MUCH LESS- AND THAT ALLOWS FOR THE DEANS AND DIRECTORS WHO ARE THE EXPERTS IN THIS KNOW WHAT THEIR STUDENTS NEED TO. KNOW WHAT CURRICULA BEST SUITS THEM KNOW WHAT RESOURCES THEY HAVE INCLUDING THE FACULTY TO GO AHEAD AND STAB WISH WHAT SERVES THE BAND AND THEIR COMMUNITY. I THINK WE CAN WORK TOGETHER ON THIS I THINK WE HAVE SOME GREAT DISCUSSIONS I THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF GOOD EVIDENCE COMING OUT. AND I THINK WHEN WE KIND OF STICK WITH THE PERCENTAGE WE'RE TYING OUR HANDS. I THINK THAT WE ARE IN AS A REGULATORY BODY IF WE JUST PUT A MINIMUM-DIRECT PATIENT CARE REQUIREMENTS. AND THE SCHOOLS THAT ARE ABLE TO DO WHAT THEY NEED TO A SIMULATION WE'VE ESTABLISHED A MINIMUM DIRECT PATIENT CARE REQUIREMENT WHICH ESTABLISHED PATIENT SAFETY WHICH IS WHAT OUR FOCUS IS A B. R. N. AND THEN BEYOND THAT. IS SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO GET INTO THE WEEDS ABOUT. SO PARTICULARLY FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES OR COMMUNITY COLLEGE NURSING PROGRAMS. THAT ARE ARE IN A BIT OF A DIFFERENT SITUATION- THAN THAN THE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT ARE PARTICIPATED TODAY. BASED ON THE FUNDING LEVEL AND THE FEES CHARGED OR NOT- THE FUNDING OF THE PARTICULAR PROGRAMS THE WAY COMMUNITY COLLEGES GENERALLY ARE FUNDED IN THE LIMITATIONS ON BRICK AND MORTAR AND- FACULTY ALIKE. THOSE THAT ARE ABLE TO GO ABOVE. THE MINIMUM BECAUSE OF THE THERE ARE SITUATIONS IN THE REACH IN TERMS OF ACUTE ON. THAT ARE TO MAKE LOTS OF A- LIKE. FOR FREE TO SO THOSE THAT. NOT FOR SOME REASON SECURE THOSE A DIRECT PATIENT CARE OPPORTUNITIES ABOVE THE MINIMUM THEY COULDMOVE TO OTHER SOURCES. IF THEY WANT TO PURSUE ADDITIONAL TRAINING FOR STUDENTS BEFORE THEY GRADUATE THE- ABSOLUTELY WE HAVE OUR PATIENTS SAFETY WE ARE NURSING STUDENTS TAKING CARE OF AND SAFETY AND PROVIDED WITH AN ADEQUATE TRAINING. THAT IS THE DIRECT PATIENT CARE THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY WANTS YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T LEARN TO SMELL INFECTION WHEN YOU'RE STANDING IN FRONT OF A MAN I CAN'T YOU CAN'T JUDGE A BODY LANGUAGE WHEN YOU WALK INTO THE ROOM YOU NEED A SERVICE. A SOCIOLOGY I'M SORRYA PSYCHOLOGY CONSULTATION BECAUSE SOMEBODY FLINCHED WHEN HE WALKED IN THE ROOM THOSE ARE THINGS THAT ARE REQUIRED BY DIRECT PATIENT CARE- EXPERIENCE AND WE CAN ESTABLISH THAT MINIMUM WE CAN ASSURE THAT THEIR STATE. THERE'S NOT MUCH THAT WE HAVE TO CHANGE WITH OUR REGULATIONS TO DO THAT AND IT OPENS THE DOOR FOR THE INDIVIDUAL ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS TO IMPLEMENT WHAT THEY CAN'T AND WHAT SERVES THEIR REACH. AND WE'RE CERTAINLY I THINK YOU'RE IN THE LEGISLATURE GOING TO HAVE TO FOCUS NOT ONLY ON OUR CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY PROGRAMS BUT CERTAINLY ON OUR- COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROGRAMS TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE PROVIDE THE RESOURCES- THAT WE PROBABLY HAVE NOT PROVIDED IN THE PAST FOR THOSE PROGRAMS TO GIVE. THOSE PROGRAMS AN EQUAL CHANCE OF SUCCESS FOR THEIR PROGRAMS AND FOR THE STUDENTS THAT ENROLL IN THEM. ANYONE ELSE WANT TO JUMP IN ON THAT LAST QUESTION WHAT DO WE DO. WITH THE CLINICAL PLACEMENT ISSUES. I DON'T YES MA'AM I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE OTHER REGULATIONS RELATED TO CONCURRENCY AND- WAS REMOVED BROWN'S OVERSIGHT WITH THE CLINICAL CLINICAL PLACEMENT APPROVALS I THINK THAT ALSO NEEDS TO BE EXAMINED. WHAT ABOUT THE COULD CURRENT ISSUE CLINICAL TRAINING VERSUS THEORY COURSES AND- I KNOW IN OTHER PROFESSIONS OF. YOU'RE ABLE TO SEPARATE CLINICAL FROM THEORY FRONT LOAD SOME BACK LOAD OTHERS I UNDERSTAND THERE'S SOME ISSUES. HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NURSING PROGRAMS THAT FORCE THEM- WELL IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT FOR US DURING THE PANDEMIC. BECAUSE THE STUDENTS WHO WERE UNABLE TO COMPLETE THEIR CLINICAL HOURS DURING A PARTICULAR SEMESTER THAN WE WERE WE'RE STRUGGLING WITH- THE CONCURRENCY OF THEIR DEGREE COURSE IN THE SUMMER OR THE SUBSEQUENT SEMESTER. AND IT JUST ADDED TO THE COMPLEXITY OF THE ISSUES WE WERE FACING WITH HAVING STUDENTS MOVE FORWARD- AND THEN ALSO RELATED TO- ORDER THROUGH ALL ADDITIONAL APPROVAL FOR CLINICAL SITES- SOMETIMES THAT THAT LIMITS US. IN TERMS OF GETTING ADDITIONAL SITES ESPECIALLY SINCE NURSING IS LOOKING MORE TOWARDS. A POPULATION BASED HEALTH CARE AND AMBULATORY CARE SOMETIMES JUST THE RED TAPE AND THE BUREAUCRACY OF GETTING ADDITIONAL SITES APPROVED THROUGH THE B. R. AND- IS NOT ENCOURAGING TRUSTOR CHANNEL SITES EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY BE THERE SO. I JUST WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT THOSE THOSE ISSUES ARE LOOKED AT AND I DID SEE THEM IN THE REPORT SOMETHING. I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU SEE THAT I HAVE SOME INPUT ON THAT TOO IF YOU'LL GIVE ME A CHANCE HERE MOBERLY OF THE DEANS AND DIRECTORS WITH THEIR CREDITORS AND- ONE IT IS ONE THAT WE NOTICED IN REGULATION AS WE DO NOT HAVE A REQUIREMENT TO RE APPROVED CLINICAL PLACEMENTS. SO IF WE DID ONE CLINICAL APPROVAL FOR AN INSTITUTION- AND THEY HAD IT IN A DAY BANK IS SOMETHING WE'RE AT- THEY THE SCHOOL COULD ACT THE DATA AND STATE WAS STILL ALREADY- I COULD SEE SCHOOLS THERE AND THEN THAT WAY WE HAVE. THAT A THE PROPLACE. AND ADDITIONAL CLINICAL OF ARE NOT NEEDED- IT COULD BE A ONE IN DONE IT IN SCHOOL CAN YOU ONE EIGHT CLINICAL APPROVAL- IT JUST THAT WE DONE THE INITIAL PROBE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S A- FOR AND IT'S SAFE. YEAR. PERFECT REPUBLICAN TO TOUCH A THE CAN. ISSUE BECAUSE IT'S A REC. THAT BUT IN THE PHYSICIAN TRAINING FIELD AND PERHAPS OTHERS. ON OCCASION. CLINICAL SPORTS FROM THREE. YOU CAN FRONT LOAD ONE. MAYBE NOT THE OTHER. HAS IT BEEN ANY THOUGHT TO CHANGING THE RULES ON THE CONCURRENCE ISSUE AS IT PERTAINS TO NURSING EDUCATION. CURRENT ISSUE IS A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT TO KIND OF TOUCH ON BECAUSE- CLINICAL BUILDS ON PIRI PIRI BILLS AND CLINICAL IT'S A VERY SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP- AND I RECEIVED COMPLAINTS FROM STUDENTS ON A REGULAR BASIS SOME THAT I FAILED OUT- AND SOME THAT ARE HAPPEN TO CONTINUE IN SCHOOL ONE OF THE COMPLAINTS THAT STANDS OUT IN MY HEAD WAS A WOMAN THAT CALLED ME AND SHE WAS IN TEARS. SHE SAID SHE WAS TAKING CARE OF A BABY THAT WAS JAUNDICED WHO HAD- WHAT'S CALLED A BILLION LIGHT ON HAND IF SHE HADN'T HAD THE THEORY ON IT YET. AND SHE DID NOT KNOW THAT THAT BABY WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE- SOME GLASSES ON IT'S A AS A PAPER PIECE THAT GOES OVER THERE I. AND IT'S SO SHE CARED FOR THE BABY SHE WAS UNDER THE BILL THE LIKES AND IT DIDN'T HAVE THE SUNGLASSES ON SHE FAILED A CLINICAL BECAUSE SHE HADN'T HAD THE THEORY ON IT. AND SHE WASN'T NECESSARILY CONCERNED ABOUT FILLING OUT A CLINICAL WHICH SHE WAS CURRENT STARTED WAS IT SHE MIGHT HAVE BECAUSE THAT CAMPAIGN TO BE BLIND AND HAVE VISUAL PROBLEMS FOR THE REST OF ITS LIFE- THE DANGER IS THERE. SO HAVING CLINICALS CONCURRENCE WITH EERIE IS SOMETHING THAT IS SUPPORTED IN THE EVIDENCE- PATRICIA BANNER THAT IS ONE OF OUR NURSING CARE SETTINGS COMPLETELY- WORLD RENOWNED- TALKS ABOUT- HOW CLINICAL FEEDS ON VERY VERY FEES AND CLICK ON HOW TO SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP. HOW MANY DRESSES THAT THEORY PRACTICE GAP THAT WE DO SEE WITHIN OUR STUDENTS- AND WE DO A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY IN A SEMESTER. AT IT IS YOU CAN FRONT LOAD BE COURSE THE STATE TO SIXTEEN WEEK SEMESTER THE FIRST EIGHT WEEKS COULD BE. A SECOND EIGHT WEEKS CAN BE KIND OF CALL- YOU CAN THAT YOU CAN DO THAT THERE'S PLENTY OF PROGRAMS OUT THERE THAT DO IT I DO HAVE A PROGRAM THAT HAD A SIXTEEN WEEK SEMESTER. THE FIRST FOUR WEEKS FOR THEORY THE SECOND TWO WEEKS FROM LAB AND THE REMAINING WEEKS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE- IN SO THEY CAN BE FLEXIBLE WITH THE IN THAT TIME FRAME TO ALLOW FOR THEIR SCHEDULING AND THEIR OUTCOMES THAT GO TO SCHOOL THEY DID THAT WERE FANTASTIC. THERE AND CLICK PASSAGE WERE. THEY WERE HAPPY WITH THE GRADUATES TO BE PRODUCED AS WELL- SO THERE ARE FLEXIBILITY BUT I THINK WE STILL NEED BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THAT BECAUSE WITH THE NURSING CARE RESEARCH REST. YOUR HUGE BREASTS THERE'S A HUGE RISK FOR OUR STUDENTS- AND I KNOW THAT IT'S BEEN INTERESTING SIMULATION AND SIMULATION IS THERE AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY HELPFUL- AND THAT'S WHY WHEN AB. TWENTY TWO EIGHTY EIGHT WAS WRITTEN THEY WROTE INTO IT THAT THE SIMULATION PART. NEEDED TO BE CONCURRENT WITH GARY AND THEN THAT THE CLINICAL CAN FOLLOW BECAUSE THEY WERE VERY MUCH AWARE OF- NEEDED TO HAVE. THAT CORRELATION SO- THAT'S THAT'S A DIFFICULT QUESTION BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A RISK. THAT YOU WHEN YOU GO TO CLINICALS AND YOU'RE JUST HAD GARY THANK CREATES QUESTIONS WHEN YOU'RE IN CLINICALS YOU HAVE THOSE EXPERIENCES YOU BRING IT BACK TO THAT AREA SECOND SEE THIS IS WHAT I EXPERIENCED. CAN YOU EXPLAIN THIS AND THEN THEY GO MORE IN DEPTH WITHOUT WITH FURY SO I HOPE THAT THAT HELPS. AND ALL BUT A REAL TENSOR WOMAN'S MOBILE I GUESS- COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THAT. THESE PARTICULARLY AT THE- COLLEGE CALL LEVEL THE NATURE THE STUDENT. WHO GRAVITATES TOWARD THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE- NURSING PROGRAM. IT IS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY TO CONSIDER THE SEPARATION OF THEORY AND CLINICAL IN THAT THE THREE COMES FIRST. BUT IF A STUDENT IS NOT ABLE TO SECURE A- A CLINICAL PLACEMENT BECAUSE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROGRAM CAN'T FIND ONE. IN THAT PARTICULAR SEMESTER IS THE STUDENT ABLE TO. FINISH THE CLINICAL IN THE FOLLOWING SEMESTER. HAVING TAKEN THE THEORY FIRST. AND I THINK WHAT WE COME INTO AN ISSUE WITH THAT IS IT IT IT'S KIND OF LIKE A BAD PAYDAY LOAN. IS THEN YOUR TAKING CLINICAL TIME FROM THE NEXT SEMESTER THAT THAT CLINICAL IS NEEDED AND THE STUDENTS COMING IN. SO IT IT IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE PIPELINE OF NURSING IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT PROGRESSION OF ALL OF THE CLASSES THAT ARE COMING IN AND THE CLASSES THAT ARE MOVING OUT. YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S CLINICAL REQUIREMENTS EACH ONE OF THOSE SEMESTERS SO IF YOU HOLD OVER TWENTY HOURS OF CLINICAL FROM A SEMESTER AND ADDED TO THE NEXT ONE. YOU STILL HAVE YOUR SEMESTER REQUIREMENT ALREADY THERE OF THE CLASSES YOU'RE GOLDEN AND THEN YOU HAVE TO PICK UP THE ADDITIONAL TWENTY AND THAT'S ALREADY IN A CLINICAL PLACEMENT THAT'S ALREADY HIGHLY IMPACTED. SO IT'S LIKE YOU'RE BORROWING FROM PETER TO PAY PAUL I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT STEPS NECESSARY TO SOLUTION AND THAT'S WHERE THE BOARD IS COMING IN REPEATEDLY WHEN WE LOOK AT RESOURCES. IS DO YOU HAVE THE CLINICAL PLACEMENTS TO SUPPORT THE STUDENTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY ENROLLED IN YOUR PROGRAM. AND IF NOT WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT- THERE ARE OPTIONS THERE ARE ANY SEIZE WORKED TIRELESSLY WITH THE PROGRAM DIRECTORS WHEN THEY CALL AND SAY HEY I LOST A CLINICAL SITE CAN YOU HELP ME. AND WE PROVIDE THEM SEVERAL OPPORTUNITIES- AND OPTIONS IN ORDER TO DO THAT- I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S A ONE ANSWER FOR THIS BUT I DO CAUTION YOU. ONLINE THE CONCURRENCY INFERI SEPARATION THAT OPENS UP TO A LOT OF RISK THAT OPENS UP TO A LOT OF DISPLACEMENT ISSUES. AND IT TRULY WILL IMPEDE THE PROGRESSION OF THE STUDENT VERSUS. HELPING THEM PROGRESS BECAUSE WHEN YOU BORROW FIFTY BUCKS FROM YOUR NEXT PAYCHECK IN YOUR ALREADY SHORT. YOU SUCKED IT PAY THAT COULD BE BUCKS BACK AND ADD THAT NEXT PAYCHECK AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT COMES INTO EACH OTHER CRITICAL REQUIREMENT THAT NEXT SEMESTER. YOU DON'T WANT TO ADD CLINICAL HOURS TO THAT NEXT SEMESTER BECAUSE THAT JUST. CAUSES MORE ABOUT DEMANDS. COOPER HAS THE ONE THAT CAN BE CAN. IN WE ESTABLISH A- EIGHTEEN UNITS. WE DO NOT STAY YOU HAVE TO HAVE TO YOU OF P. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A- UNITS OF. LIKE WE LET THE SCHOOLS DECIDE WE JUST EIGHTEEN UNITS SO IF THEY'RE HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME. GETTING CLINICAL PLACEMENTS IN SIGHT. THEN MAYBE THEY CAN CONSIDER THAT THEY ONLY NEED A SMALLER AMOUNT A UNIT. IN THAT SITE TO ADEQUATELY MEET THEIR OUTCOMES- AND THAT AGAIN DECREASES AGAIN EVERY UNIT IS FORTY EIGHT HOURS. IN A CLINICAL THAT CAN BE MOVED AROUND FROM A STUDENT. AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY PERHAPS YOUR MOVE TOWARDS SETTING UP. MEDICAL MINIMUM DIRECT PATIENT CONTACT LEVEL AND- PERHAPS THE SCHOOLS THAT INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF SIMULATION THAT'S PERMITTED IN THEIR PROGRAMS WELL SORT OF LEVEL OUT THIS CLINICAL PLACEMENT ISSUE. AROUND THE STATE IN THAT REGARD I'M I'M HOPING THAT THE BOARD IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE VARIOUS SCHOOLS AND MAYBE THE ASSOCIATIONS. CAN HELP FIGURE OUT HOW TO COLLECT DATA SO WE CAN GET SOME IDEA AS TO WHETHER THIS CLINICAL PLACEMENT. SITUATION REMAINS AN ISSUE. FOLLOWING THE CHANGES IN MINIMUM TRAINING REQUIREMENTS. OR NOT AND THAT WILL HELP US ASSESS THE CURRENT SITUATION WITH RESPECT TO NURSING EDUCATION THANK YOU FOR THE RESPONSE. DOES ANY FURTHER COMMENTS BEFORE- BUT CHECK WITH MY COLLEAGUES TO SEE IF ANYONE HAS ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS AND WE MOVE ON ANY FURTHER COMMENTS. I HAVE I HAVE A COMMENT I WANTED TO JUST MENTION THAT THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES OF NURSING HAS RECENTLY- REVISED THERE EAT THERE EAST CENTRAL'S FOR EACH OF THE LEVELS OF EDUCATION. AND THEY ARE MOVING TOWARDS A COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION OUR SYSTEM SO WHY ARE WE FOCUSED ON OURS WHEN WE LOOK NEED TO LOOK AT COMPETENCY. AND AS IT'S BEEN MENTIONED EARLIER THE FACULTY DEANS AND DIRECTORS ARE ABLE THEIR EXPERTS THEY KNOW WHAT THE STUDENTS NEED ENTIRE IN TERMS OF- THE METHODOLOGY THAT WILL BEST MEET THE LEARNING OUTCOMES. SO IF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES OF NURSING IS MOVING TOWARDS THIS WE SHOULD FOLLOW SUIT IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU INTERESTING COMMENTS ANYTHING FURTHER PANELISTS I YES I STILL I HOLD THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT VERY CLINICAL CONCURRENCY ISSUE BECAUSE IT DID SIGNIFICANTLY- AFFECT OUR STUDENTS ABILITY TO PROGRESSIVE PROGRAM BECAUSE STOP. THEY NEEDED TO FINISH IN SUMMER BUT YET THEY WORK AND HAVE TEARS SO I JUST I JUST ASK THAT WE CONTINUE TO EXAMINE THAT IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND AS LONG AS THEORY COMES FIRST I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND DOING CLINICAL WITHOUT THE THEORY BEHIND IT BUT- THE POINT IS TO HAVE A THEORY FIRST AND PERHAPS IN SUMMER OR SUBSEQUENT SEMESTER APPLY THAT. IN A CRITICAL SITUATION. THANK YOU. AND FOR SURE OF THIS CLINICAL PLACEMENT SITUATION- IT IS NOT RESOLVED SOMEHOW I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CERTAINLY REVISIT- CLINICAL PLACEMENTS IN. IN THE ORDER OF THINGS ANYTHING FURTHER PANELISTS I SEE MY COLLEAGUE IN ARCHULETA WANTS TO ASK A QUESTION- YES THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AND I AT MY HAT'S OFF TO YOU SIR YOU HAVE DONE A FANTASTIC JOB- WITH ADMINISTRATORS AND EVERYONE THAT'S BEEN INVOLVED TODAY- REPRESENTING. AND I'D LIKE TO JUST POINT OUT THAT- I AM SO IMPRESSED THAT THE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC. SCHOOLS THAT ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO ACCOMPLISH THE SAME THING TO DELIVER TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE BRIGHTEST AND BEST NURSES WE CAN GET- ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND I HOPE THAT- THE BOARD UNDERSTANDS THAT- WE WERE VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT. THE TIME FRAME TO GET THE LICENSES- TO THESE INDIVIDUALS UPON GRADUATION AND RUNNING THROUGH THE SYSTEM AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND ALSO THAT THE SCHOOLS UNDERSTAND IF THERE'S ANYTHING THEY CAN DO TO HELP THE PROCESS GETTING THE STUDENTS FINGERPRINTED- HELPING THEM ALONG SO THEY CAN. GRADUATE AND HIT THE GROUND RUNNING TO GO AHEAD AND OBTAIN THEIR LICENSE SO THEY CAN START PRACTICING- BUT WITH THAT I THANK EVERYONE FOR THEIR PRESENTATION DAY AND- I THANK YOU FOR- THE WORK YOU DO.

NATIONWIDE FOR PROFIT NURSING PROGRAMS HAVE INCREASED FOUR HUNDRED AND 2% BY INCREASING THEIR ENROLLMENT UNPACKED THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS WILL CLOSE PUBLIC COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS OUT OF HOSPITAL PLACEMENTS THAT PREPARE THEM TO BE REGISTERED NURSES. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THIS CHARGES ARE EXASPERATED BY HOSPITALS AND FACILITIES SPEAKING FEES AND AN EXPERIENCED NURSES ALSO SEEKING NEW GRAPPLES NOTED BY PHH TODAY. ALTHOUGH SOME CONTEND THAT DURING THE NURSING LIKE YOUR CONTACT TO BROADEN THE POOL OF NURSES ELIGIBLE TO WORK IN CALIFORNIA.

ZERO NEXT OVER TWENTY FORTY EIGHT PLEASE GO AHEAD. HELLO CAN YOU HEAR ME. PERFECTLY THANK YOU COULD- PERFECT- GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- MY NAME IS MICHAEL CRISTINA AND I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME HERE IN THE OFFICE TODAY AND ALLOW ME TO SPEAK MY PIECE ON THE MATTER REGARDING THE CONTRIBUTORS TOWARDS THIS NURSING SHORTAGE- MY FIANCEE SHE'S A REGISTERED NURSE WHO WAS SENTENCED TO RIGOROUS TO- RIGOROUS PROBATIONARY STIPULATIONS IN THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY. FOUR OFFENSES SHE COMMITTED NINE PLUS YEARS AGO MARCHING TOWARD HOMELESSNESS I WASHER ALL THROUGHOUT COLLEGE WHILE SHE PUSHED HERSELF WERE EXCELLENT GRADES REQUIRED BY THE NURSING PROGRAM AND I WASHER AGAIN AS YOU PUSH YOURSELF FURTHER TO COMPLETE THE RIGOROUS NURSING PROGRAM AND THEN AGAIN BOSTON DOOR GARLIC AFTER GAUNTLET AND POSED BY THE PR AND PROBATIONARY STIPULATION. BASICALLY AT THE PROBATIONARY NURSE I KNOW SHE HAS WORKED TEN TIMES HARDER THAN OUR PEERS WHO PRACTICAL THOUGHT THE PROBATIONARY CHAINS INCURRED BY THE DVR AND ISSUES TRIPS THAT TREATED AS INFERIOR- THIRTY ALL DAY DURING ALL THIS I MADE SURE TO COVER HER FOR ALL HER TEARS AND MAKE SURE. TO LET HER KNOW THAT WOULD ALL GET BETTER. BUT THERE'S SOMETHING THAT I VERY TROUBLING WHICH TOOK ME MY CORE DEFECTS SHAKING NOW. THE PROBABLY AT NEWSSTAND YOU PUT IS NEWS ME AT I STARTED CONNECTING THE- I REACHED LEARNED ABOUT. BOARD MEMBER MICHAEL DEANGELO AND FORMER EXECUTIVE OFFICER JOSEPH MORRIS ENTERED THE ROOM CONTROVERSY TO THE FAR OFFENSES. AND SEXUAL ASSAULT ALLEGATIONS. OF COURSE THIS IS OLD NEWS BUT IT IS NOT OLD NEWS TO ME A JOSEPH MORRIS IS THE ONE WHO HANDED DOWN THE SENTENCE INTO MY FIANCE. OR HER OFFENSE RECORD SHE INQUIRED AT THE LOWEST POINT IN OUR LIFE. ABSOLUTELY BOGGLES MY MIND HOW THESE MEN WHO ACTED UNETHICALLY ARE THE ONES WHO HAVE THE AUDACITY TO TREAT MY FIANCE LIKE A CRIMINAL. WHICH THE CBR AND CONTINUING TO DO TODAY BASED ON JOSEPH MOORE'S DECISION. MY QUESTION IS. ARE THERE ANY PLANS TO REVIEW THE CASES OF THESE PROBATIONARY NURSES WHO HAD THEIR DECISION AND ORDER SIGNED BY JOSEPH MORRIS. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME THAT MY FIANCE WAS SENTENCED TO PROBATION FOR OFFENSES THE HOBBIT NINE PLUS YEARS AGO. AFTER EXPUNGEMENT OF A RECORD BY NURSING BOARD WHO ARE COMMITTING CRIME INSULT. WHAT ACCURATE AGGRAVATE THE FURTHER IF THAT THE PROBATIONARY NURSES ARE HELD TO A GOD STANDARD WHICH NO OTHER PERSON THAT THE CORRECT. ME ESPECIALLY THE BOARD. I RECENTLY LEARNED ABOUT A PROBATIONARY NURSE WHO HAD TO TAKE A URINE TEST AS SHE WAS IN ACTIVE LABOR WHERE SHE RISK LOSING HER LIFE THAT SHE DIDN'T PROVIDE THE URINE SAMPLE REQUIRED BY THE BOARD. OF REGISTERED NURSES. AT THE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS OR EVEN AT THE HUMAN BEING THE TYPE OF HUMANE TREATMENT IMPOSED BY THE STATE. IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE TO ME I'M JUST WONDERING AS TO THE DOCTOR THE CATION OF THIS TREATMENT. I KNOW TODAY'S MEETING IS IN REGARDS TO A NURSING SHORTAGE. I MEAN I'M JUST NOT SUTTER LOOKING AND BUT I WOULD ADVISE YOU TO LOOK INTO THE CEDAR AND- FORCE DIVISION ONE NURSES ARE WAITING TO WORK. WHAT THE APPLICATIONS CAN TAKE YEARS TO BE APPROVED. AFTER BEING APPROVED IT'S VERY HARD TO FIND A JOB PLACEMENT TO THE- DUE TO THE SEVERITY OF THE RESTRICTIONS. I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW THE NURSES ARE THERE. IN A LITTLE BAFFLING TO HEAR ABOUT THE STATE. IS. WORRIED ABOUT THE NURSING SHORTAGE. WHEN IT SAME STATE THAT A BAR TO IGNORE CONTRACT. IN THE LONG. AND ABOUT A TRACTOR THE DELAYS. WHICH DISK. POINT OUT. THERE'S THIS TERRIBLE STICK FIGURE OUT THERE THAT PROBATIONARY ARE DE GOODS. WHICH THEY ARE NOT IN FACT HUNDRED NURSES WHO WORK PROBATION FOR THAT HAPPENED BEFORE THE THOUGHT OF. A EVER RAN THROUGH THERE MIGHT. BUT DUE TO THE SAID IN PLAY THOSE NURSES WHO CLOSED PASSED THE- ARIAN OR SQUAT WITH KOBE. THE PEOPLE. WHICH MADE THEM UNDESIRABLE EMPLOYERS BEFORE THEY EVER HAD THE CHANCE TO PRACTICE. DESPITE COMPLETELY PERFORMANCE. FELT BUT BEYOND STATE. I WOULD CURRENTLY UP TO. WITH FIRE AFTER KOBE HAD DIED DOWN. FOR EMPLOYER WOULD LOOKING FOR ANY REASON THE FIRE HER THE BIG NO LONGER HAD TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FASCICULATIONS REQUIRED BY THE BOARD. ESPECIALLY THE OBLIGATION TO GIVE A URINE SAMPLE DURING WORKING HOURS WHERE SHE HAD TO WAIT AT THE COLLECTION SITE AWAY FROM OUR PATIENTS BUT TWENTY FOUR HOURS. THE SITUATION OBLIGATION BAKER BOYER FRUSTRATED ESPECIALLY DURING THE WHILE NUMBER SHORTAGE WE ARE ALL AWARE OF. ANYWAY I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITHIN THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING AND I HOPE YOU FIND MEN AND WOMEN FIND A WAY TO COMPLETELY REMOVE THE TOXICITY. IN THE POCKET THE EMBEDDED WITHIN THE BOARD THE FUTURE NURSES OFTEN DOOR THE UNNECESSARY SUFFERING. I'M SORRY THAT THE NURSING SHORTAGE BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE NURSES ARE THERE. BUT THEY AREN'T ABLE TO WORK TO THE STIPULATION EFFECTUALLY STIPULATIONS ONE NINETEEN. I HOPE YOU ALL FIND THESE NURSES HELPING FOR THEM. ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH CONTEMPT.
