CURRENT DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS

INSTRUCTIONS SUCH AS SUSPENSIONS

00:28:55.934 --> 00:28:59.171 region:rollup2
OR EXPLOSIONS. HOPE IMPROVE

00:28:58.003 --> 00:29:00.872 region:rollup2
EITHER STUDENT BEHAVIOR OR

00:28:59.171 --> 00:29:02.708 region:rollup2
SCHOOL CLIMATE.

00:29:00.872 --> 00:29:04.710 region:rollup2
SUSPENSIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH

00:29:02.708 --> 00:29:06.245 region:rollup2
NEGATIVE STUDENT OUTCOMES SUCH

00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:08.013 region:rollup2
AS LAW ACADEMIC PERFORMANCES

00:29:06.245 --> 00:29:09.815 region:rollup2
HIGHER RATES HAVE DROPPED OUT

00:29:08.013 --> 00:29:11.817 region:rollup2
FAILURES TO GRADUATE ON TIME

00:29:09.815 --> 00:29:15.153 region:rollup2
DECREASE ACADEMIC ENGAGEMENT AND

00:29:11.817 --> 00:29:17.289 region:rollup2
FUTURE DISCIPLINARY EXCLUSION.

00:29:15.153 --> 00:29:18.657 region:rollup2
NOW WE WANT STUDENTS ANSWERED

00:29:17.289 --> 00:29:19.758 region:rollup2
THIS VICIOUS CYCLE OF BEING

00:29:18.657 --> 00:29:21.026 region:rollup2
TAKEN HEALTH CLASS AS A FORM OF

00:29:19.758 --> 00:29:22.361 region:rollup2
DISCIPLINE.

00:29:21.026 --> 00:29:25.364 region:rollup2
CAUSING THEM TO FALL BEHIND IN

00:29:22.361 --> 00:29:25.864 region:rollup2
CLASS WHICH IS FULL OF ANXIETY

00:29:25.364 --> 00:29:27.666 region:rollup2
AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF RE

00:29:25.864 --> 00:29:29.301 region:rollup2
OFFENDING.

00:29:27.666 --> 00:29:31.103 region:rollup2
CLEARLY THE DISCIPLINARY SYSTEM

00:29:29.301 --> 00:29:32.938 region:rollup2
IS FLAWED AND THE PUNISHMENTS OF

00:29:31.103 --> 00:29:34.439 region:rollup2
STUDENT ACTIONS SUCH AS

00:29:32.938 --> 00:29:35.941 region:rollup2
SUSPENSION OR EXPULSION HAVE

00:29:34.439 --> 00:29:37.743 region:rollup2
VERY MINIMAL POSITIVE EFFECT IN

00:29:35.941 --> 00:29:39.077 region:rollup2
THE LONG TERM.

00:29:37.743 --> 00:29:41.280 region:rollup2
THE DISSIDENT DISCIPLINARY

00:29:39.077 --> 00:29:42.814 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IN PLACE TODAY ONLY EXIST

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:44.616 region:rollup2
DUE TO TRADITION THE EDUCATION

00:29:42.814 --> 00:29:46.151 region:rollup2
SYSTEM CONTINUES TO UC'S

00:29:44.616 --> 00:29:47.285 region:rollup2
PRACTICES SIMPLY BECAUSE IT

00:29:46.151 --> 00:29:48.920 region:rollup2
ALWAYS HOUSE BUT IT IS TIME TO

00:29:47.285 --> 00:29:50.155 region:rollup2
CHANGE.

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.989 region:rollup2
FOR THE BETTERMENT OF STUDENTS

00:29:50.155 --> 00:29:52.891 region:rollup2
AND THE SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT THAT

00:29:50.989 --> 00:29:53.959 region:rollup2
THEY ARE A PART OF.

00:29:52.891 --> 00:29:56.128 region:rollup2
BUT WE ARE PROPOSING TO YOU

00:29:53.959 --> 00:29:57.162 region:rollup2
TODAY IS A SOLUTION FOR THE ROOT

00:29:56.128 --> 00:29:59.031 region:rollup2
CAUSE OF ALL THESE DISPARITIES

00:29:57.162 --> 00:30:01.066 region:rollup2
WERE SORT OF JUSTICE.

00:29:59.031 --> 00:30:02.968 region:rollup2
RESTORED OF JUSTICE.

00:30:01.066 --> 00:30:03.468 region:rollup2
IT'S A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO

00:30:02.968 --> 00:30:05.003 region:rollup2
DISCIPLINE THE LOOK THAT

00:30:03.468 --> 00:30:06.905 region:rollup2
HEALING%

00:30:05.003 --> 00:30:08.774 region:rollup2
AS A MEANS OF RECONCILIATION.

00:30:06.905 --> 00:30:10.642 region:rollup2
THIS SYSTEM FOCUSES ON ALL

00:30:08.774 --> 00:30:12.077 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS AS THEY ARE GUIDED

00:30:10.642 --> 00:30:14.680 region:rollup2
THROUGH METHODS INCLUDING WERE

00:30:12.077 --> 00:30:16.381 region:rollup2
SORT OF CIRCLES DIALOGUE CIRCLES

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:17.215 region:rollup2
PEER JURIES MEDIATION. AND

00:30:16.381 --> 00:30:19.151 region:rollup2
CONFERENCING BY TRAINED

00:30:17.215 --> 00:30:20.852 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONALS.

00:30:19.151 --> 00:30:22.287 region:rollup2
WELL WE RECOGNIZE SUSPENSIONS

00:30:20.852 --> 00:30:24.322 region:rollup2
AND EXPULSIONS ARE NECESSARY

00:30:22.287 --> 00:30:25.824 region:rollup2
FORMS OF DISCIPLINE.

00:30:24.322 --> 00:30:27.125 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THAT THE ADDITION OF

00:30:25.824 --> 00:30:29.394 region:rollup2
A SORT OF JUSTICE TO THESE

00:30:27.125 --> 00:30:30.729 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES IS SUPERIOR AND

00:30:29.394 --> 00:30:33.498 region:rollup2
MORE BENEFICIAL TO THE SCHOOL

00:30:30.729 --> 00:30:34.766 region:rollup2
AND DISCIPLINARY SYSTEM.

00:30:33.498 --> 00:30:37.502 region:rollup2
SADISTIC SHOW THAT RESTORED OF

00:30:34.766 --> 00:30:38.870 region:rollup2
JUSTICE SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASES

00:30:37.502 --> 00:30:40.439 region:rollup2
THE SCHOOL SUSPENSION RATES AND

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:42.941 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OF REPEAT OFFENSES

00:30:40.439 --> 00:30:44.643 region:rollup2
COMMITTED BY STUDENTS.

00:30:42.941 --> 00:30:46.211 region:rollup2
AND MERCER COUNTY ALONE

00:30:44.643 --> 00:30:48.246 region:rollup2
SUSPENSION RATES DECREASED BY

00:30:46.211 --> 00:30:50.349 region:rollup2
FORTY PERCENT AFTER SORT OF

00:30:48.246 --> 00:30:52.718 region:rollup2
JUSTICE WAS IMPLEMENTED.

00:30:50.349 --> 00:30:54.820 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION A STUDY PUBLISHED BY

00:30:52.718 --> 00:30:56.521 region:rollup2
THE YOUTH VIOLENCE JUVENILE SO

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:57.456 region:rollup2
JUSTICE STATED THAT ONE

00:30:56.521 --> 00:30:59.358 region:rollup2
TRADITIONAL DISCIPLINARY

00:30:57.456 --> 00:31:00.692 region:rollup2
MEASURES WERE USED.

00:30:59.358 --> 00:31:02.527 region:rollup2
THE RECIDIVISM ATE WAS FIFTY

00:31:00.692 --> 00:31:04.796 region:rollup2
PERCENT BUT AFTER SORT OF

00:31:02.527 --> 00:31:07.733 region:rollup2
JUSTICE TRAINING THIS PERCENTAGE

00:31:04.796 --> 00:31:09.634 region:rollup2
DROPPED TO THIRTY ONE PERCENT.

00:31:07.733 --> 00:31:11.503 region:rollup2
IN ONE SPECIFIC CASE ASSUME IT

SEVERE ANGER ISSUES.

00:31:15.574 --> 00:31:18.610 region:rollup2
AFTER BEING CHARGED WITH ASSAULT

00:31:17.075 --> 00:31:20.979 region:rollup2
WITH A DEADLY WEAPON.

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:22.814 region:rollup2
MATHIS UNDERWENT RESTORATIVE

00:31:20.979 --> 00:31:24.082 region:rollup2

RESPECT

00:31:26.218 --> 00:31:29.221 region:rollup2
WHICH MOTIVATED HIM TO INCREASE

00:31:27.552 --> 00:31:31.356 region:rollup2
HIS GPA.

00:31:29.221 --> 00:31:32.257 region:rollup2

ANGER ISSUES.

00:31:34.593 --> 00:31:38.530 region:rollup2
MATHIS THEN PROCEEDED TO ATTEND

THE ABILITY TO CHANGE ONE'S LIFE

00:31:44.403 --> 00:31:46.972 region:rollup2
REGARDLESS OF THE SEVERITY OF

00:31:45.137 --> 00:31:48.607 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE.

00:31:46.972 --> 00:31:50.375 region:rollup2
THIS REINFORCES HOW RESTORED OF

00:31:48.607 --> 00:31:51.610 region:rollup2
JUSTICE SHOWS AYE MINISTRATIONS

CAN CARE FOR THE PERSONAL GROWTH

00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:56.515 region:rollup2
OF THEIR STUDENTS.

00:31:54.346 --> 00:31:57.783 region:rollup2
WE ADVOCATE THAT THE CALIFORNIA

00:31:56.515 --> 00:31:59.851 region:rollup2
LEGISLATORS SHOULD CREATE A

00:31:57.783 --> 00:32:02.087 region:rollup2
COMPETITIVE GRANT TO BE AWARDED

INDIVIDUAL DISTRICTS.

00:32:12.531 --> 00:32:16.101 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WILL

00:35:58.523 --> 00:36:03.228 region:rollup2
SAVING THE STATE MONEY THAT WAS

00:36:00.825 --> 00:36:04.529 region:rollup2
UP IS THAT PART YOUR PLAN TO CUT

00:36:03.228 --> 00:36:05.764 region:rollup2
THE TRACK SOME OF THAT DATA.

00:36:04.529 --> 00:36:07.666 region:rollup2

00:36:10.669 --> 00:36:14.906 region:rollup2
HAVE A SUCCESS RATE AND DP

00:36:12.804 --> 00:36:15.306 region:rollup2
SUSPENSION RATES THAT WOULD BE

00:36:14.906 --> 00:36:18.610 region:rollup2

BELLAMY BRING YOU THE

00:36:45.336 --> 00:36:48.073 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE OF A HIGH SCHOOL

TEACHER.

00:36:48.073 --> 00:36:52.944 region:rollup2
AYE AYE I THINK OF A SCHOOL

00:36:50.575 --> 00:36:54.679 region:rollup2
DISTRICT OR A TEACHER. SCHOOL.

00:36:52.944 --> 00:36:56.748 region:rollup2
IS SUSPENDING STUDENTS FOR BEING

00:36:54.679 --> 00:36:58.750 region:rollup2
LATE RIGHT.

00:36:56.748 --> 00:37:00.085 region:rollup2
THEM IN IN FOR SOME OTHER WHAT

00:36:58.750 --> 00:37:01.953 region:rollup2
I WOULD CALL MINOR INFRACTIONS

00:37:00.085 --> 00:37:03.922 region:rollup2
THAT'S A REAL PROBLEM. GAY AND

00:37:01.953 --> 00:37:04.456 region:rollup2
THERE NEEDS TO BE A CHANGE

00:37:03.922 --> 00:37:05.724 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE SCHOOL NEEDS TO

00:37:04.456 --> 00:37:07.192 region:rollup2
CHANGE.

00:37:05.724 --> 00:37:09.160 region:rollup2
THEIR CULTURE AND HOW THEY

00:37:07.192 --> 00:37:10.195 region:rollup2
DISCIPLINE STUDENTS IF YOU WELL

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:11.596 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I THINK YOU KNOW JUST

00:37:10.195 --> 00:37:13.031 region:rollup2
BEING LATER SOME OTHER MINOR

00:37:11.596 --> 00:37:14.499 region:rollup2
INFRACTIONS ISN'T REASON TO

00:37:13.031 --> 00:37:16.067 region:rollup2
SPEND ANY STUDENT. BUT I KNOW

00:37:14.499 --> 00:37:17.435 region:rollup2
YOUR. YOUR YOUR CONCEPT HEARING

00:37:16.067 --> 00:37:18.837 region:rollup2
COMPASSES MORE THAN JUST SCHOOL

00:37:17.435 --> 00:37:19.704 region:rollup2
ATTENDANCE.

00:37:18.837 --> 00:37:21.272 region:rollup2
I JUST FROM THE PERSPECTIVE THAT

00:37:19.704 --> 00:37:22.607 region:rollup2
MAYBE SOMETIMES THERE IS A PLACE

00:37:21.272 --> 00:37:24.542 region:rollup2
WHERE STUDENT TO BE SUSPENDED

00:37:22.607 --> 00:37:26.211 region:rollup2
THAT'S YOU TYPICALLY. FOR AYE

00:37:24.542 --> 00:37:27.345 region:rollup2
LABEL STUDENT SAFETY LET'S SAY

00:37:26.211 --> 00:37:27.912 region:rollup2
THERE'S A FIGHT ON CAMPUS RIGHT

00:37:27.345 --> 00:37:29.547 region:rollup2
WE'VE WE KNOW THOSE HAPPEN

00:37:27.912 --> 00:37:31.149 region:rollup2
OCCASIONALLY. AND SOMETIMES IT'S

00:37:29.547 --> 00:37:32.450 region:rollup2
JUST BEST TO REMOVE A STUDENT

00:37:31.149 --> 00:37:34.352 region:rollup2
FROM THE SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT FOR

00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:35.487 region:rollup2
A FEW DAYS TO LET THINGS COOL

00:37:34.352 --> 00:37:36.721 region:rollup2
DOWN.

00:37:35.487 --> 00:37:37.856 region:rollup2
OFTEN IT'S FOR THE SAFETY NOT

00:37:36.721 --> 00:37:40.625 region:rollup2
EVEN OF OTHER STUDENTS FOR THE

00:37:37.856 --> 00:37:42.260 region:rollup2
STUDENT WHO MAYBE IT WAS IT

00:37:40.625 --> 00:37:43.628 region:rollup2
WOULD TO WAS WAS SUSPENDED

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:44.696 region:rollup2
PULLING THEM BACK. SO THEY'RE

00:37:43.628 --> 00:37:46.331 region:rollup2
NOT IN THE IT WOULD THAT THE

00:37:44.696 --> 00:37:46.831 region:rollup2
SCHOOL POPULATION OF THINGS COOL

00:37:46.331 --> 00:37:47.966 region:rollup2
DOWN SO THERE IS A PLACE

00:37:46.831 --> 00:37:49.567 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES.

00:37:47.966 --> 00:37:50.902 region:rollup2
FORCES VENTURA SHOULD NOT BE A

00:37:49.567 --> 00:37:51.503 region:rollup2
NORMAL COURSE OF.

00:37:50.902 --> 00:37:54.005 region:rollup2
DIS OF.

00:37:51.503 --> 00:37:55.673 region:rollup2
OF A DISCIPLINARY ACT.

00:37:54.005 --> 00:37:56.908 region:rollup2
IN IT SHOULDN'T BE FOR A MINOR

00:37:55.673 --> 00:37:58.676 region:rollup2
REASON IT SHOULD BE OR SOMETHING

00:37:56.908 --> 00:38:00.879 region:rollup2
EGREGIOUS AND SOMETHING REALLY

00:37:58.676 --> 00:38:03.114 region:rollup2
RELATIVE TO SAFETY OF OF OF A OR

THAT.

00:38:03.748 --> 00:38:07.285 region:rollup2
AND I THINK CALIFORNIA IS

00:38:05.884 --> 00:38:08.520 region:rollup2
HEADING DOWN THIS PATH.

00:38:07.285 --> 00:38:10.355 region:rollup2
WE'VE DONE A LOT LEGISLATIVELY

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:12.056 region:rollup2
AND WITH THE BUDGET.

00:38:10.355 --> 00:38:13.424 region:rollup2
TO ENSURE THAT WE TAKE THIS KIND

00:38:12.056 --> 00:38:14.392 region:rollup2
OF APPROACH IS SCHOOLS REALLY

00:38:13.424 --> 00:38:15.326 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT WHY THEY'RE

00:38:14.392 --> 00:38:17.195 region:rollup2
SUSPENDING OR EVEN DISCIPLINING

00:38:15.326 --> 00:38:18.696 region:rollup2

00:38:18.696 --> 00:38:22.534 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT AND REALLY FALSELY

00:38:20.198 --> 00:38:23.434 region:rollup2

00:42:03.321 --> 00:42:06.958 region:rollup2
SUICIDE.

TREATMENT THEY NEEDED A

00:42:07.458 --> 00:42:10.561 region:rollup2
DESERVED.

ALL THE SPECS FOR THE FOLLOWING

00:42:10.561 --> 00:42:13.598 region:rollup2
QUESTION.

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:14.799 region:rollup2
IF POLITICAL RHETORIC AND ACTION

00:42:13.598 --> 00:42:15.933 region:rollup2
REGARDING MENTAL HEALTH HAS

00:42:14.799 --> 00:42:18.269 region:rollup2
INCREASED EXPONENTIALLY WITH IN

00:42:15.933 --> 00:42:18.803 region:rollup2
THE PAST DECADE.

00:42:18.269 --> 00:42:20.271 region:rollup2
WATER SUICIDE RATES STILL

00:42:18.803 --> 00:42:21.506 region:rollup2
INCREASING.

00:42:20.271 --> 00:42:22.140 region:rollup2
WE ATTEMPTED TO ANSWER THIS

00:42:21.506 --> 00:42:23.674 region:rollup2
QUESTION OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF

00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:24.709 region:rollup2
DAYS.

00:42:23.674 --> 00:42:27.311 region:rollup2
AND WE CAN'T AND WE BELIEVE WE

00:42:24.709 --> 00:42:28.646 region:rollup2
CAN LEVEL SOLUTION.

00:42:27.311 --> 00:42:29.647 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVED THAT WE COULD CREATE

00:42:28.646 --> 00:42:31.382 region:rollup2
MATT'S HOUSE STANDARDS IN ALL

00:42:29.647 --> 00:42:32.817 region:rollup2
GRADES TO TEACH THOSE ON ISSUES

00:42:31.382 --> 00:42:34.485 region:rollup2
REGARDING MENTAL ILLNESS.

00:42:32.817 --> 00:42:35.553 region:rollup2
HOWEVER TOWARDS THE END OF OUR

00:42:34.485 --> 00:42:37.088 region:rollup2
PROJECT OR RESEARCH TOOK A

00:42:35.553 --> 00:42:38.256 region:rollup2
SURPRISING TURN.

00:42:37.088 --> 00:42:39.390 region:rollup2
AS WE ARE LOOKING INTO IT

00:42:38.256 --> 00:42:41.325 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH

00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:42.627 region:rollup2
EDUCATION STANDARDS WE FOUND OUT

00:42:41.325 --> 00:42:45.163 region:rollup2
THE MENTAL HEALTH EDUCATION IS

00:42:42.627 --> 00:42:46.998 region:rollup2
ALREADY. A STANDARD FOR STUDENTS

00:42:45.163 --> 00:42:47.732 region:rollup2
AND YET AMONG THE ELEVEN OF US

00:42:46.998 --> 00:42:49.734 region:rollup2
WORKING ON MENTAL HEALTH

00:42:47.732 --> 00:42:51.035 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE. ONLY ONE OF US HAD

00:42:49.734 --> 00:42:53.504 region:rollup2
RECALL RECEIVING MENTAL HEALTH

00:42:51.035 --> 00:42:54.839 region:rollup2
EDUCATION IN SCHOOL.

00:42:53.504 --> 00:42:56.574 region:rollup2
WE FOUND OUT THAT TEACHERS AND

00:42:54.839 --> 00:42:58.376 region:rollup2
DISTRICT OFFICIALS ARE HEAVILY

00:42:56.574 --> 00:42:59.844 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGED BY THE STATE TO TEACH

00:42:58.376 --> 00:43:01.012 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH AND CONJUNCTIONS

00:42:59.844 --> 00:43:02.747 region:rollup2
WITH THINGS LIKE NUTRITION OR

00:43:01.012 --> 00:43:03.948 region:rollup2
SEXUAL EDUCATION.

00:43:02.747 --> 00:43:05.817 region:rollup2
BUT THAT THIS EDUCATION IS

00:43:03.948 --> 00:43:06.851 region:rollup2
SIMPLY LACKING.

00:43:05.817 --> 00:43:08.686 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT THE NEGATIVE

00:43:06.851 --> 00:43:09.954 region:rollup2
EFFECTS OF THIS CIRCUMVENTION R.

00:43:08.686 --> 00:43:10.955 region:rollup2
GLARINGLY EVIDENT IN THE

00:43:09.954 --> 00:43:13.024 region:rollup2
DEPRESSION AND SUICIDE

00:43:10.955 --> 00:43:14.659 region:rollup2
STATISTICS IN THE STATE.

00:43:13.024 --> 00:43:16.360 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

00:43:14.659 --> 00:43:17.562 region:rollup2
THE STANDARDS CAN SAVE LIVES AND

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:19.263 region:rollup2
THE US WE ADVOCATE FOR THE

FOLLOWING PROPOSAL.

00:43:19.263 --> 00:43:21.866 region:rollup2

00:43:23.868 --> 00:43:26.804 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION OF MENTAL HEALTH

00:43:24.769 --> 00:43:28.439 region:rollup2
STANDARDS.

00:43:26.804 --> 00:43:29.674 region:rollup2
ON THIS TASK FORCE WE PROPOSED

00:43:28.439 --> 00:43:31.442 region:rollup2

A STUDENT A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER

00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:38.516 region:rollup2
AND A PSYCHOLOGIST. WE BELIEVE

00:43:37.381 --> 00:43:40.685 region:rollup2
THAT THIS COMBINATION OF

00:43:38.516 --> 00:43:42.120 region:rollup2
EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS STUDENTS

00:43:40.685 --> 00:43:43.621 region:rollup2
AND PARENTS WILL SYSTEM

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:44.889 region:rollup2
FOSTERING A UNIQUE ENVIRONMENT

00:43:43.621 --> 00:43:46.691 region:rollup2
WHICH MAXIMIZES THE

00:43:44.889 --> 00:43:48.526 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE TASKS.

00:43:46.691 --> 00:43:50.194 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY EACH MEMBER OF THE

00:43:48.526 --> 00:43:51.295 region:rollup2
TASK FORCE WOULD HAVE A SPECIFIC

00:43:50.194 --> 00:43:52.230 region:rollup2
CONNECTION TO ACTIVE

00:43:51.295 --> 00:43:54.165 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS WITHIN THE

00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:55.433 region:rollup2
EDUCATION SYSTEM. WE LIKE TO ADD

00:43:54.165 --> 00:43:57.101 region:rollup2
THAT OUR LIST OF MEMBERS IS

00:43:55.433 --> 00:43:59.003 region:rollup2
NEITHER COMPLETELY INFLEXIBLE

00:43:57.101 --> 00:44:00.605 region:rollup2
NOR EXHAUSTIVE RATHER THIS LIST

00:43:59.003 --> 00:44:02.440 region:rollup2
CAN ACT AS BOTH A ANCHORING

00:44:00.605 --> 00:44:03.875 region:rollup2
FORCE AND A BLUEPRINT TO HELP

00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:05.643 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT OUR VISION. OUR

00:44:03.875 --> 00:44:07.111 region:rollup2
SOLUTION RELIES ON A RELATIVELY

00:44:05.643 --> 00:44:08.446 region:rollup2
BASIC CONCEPT THERE ARE GOOD

00:44:07.111 --> 00:44:10.014 region:rollup2
POLICIES THAT EXPERTS HAVE

00:44:08.446 --> 00:44:11.749 region:rollup2
ALREADY CREATED IN THE STATUS

00:44:10.014 --> 00:44:13.284 region:rollup2
QUO BUT THEY CAN ONLY WORK IF

00:44:11.749 --> 00:44:14.986 region:rollup2
THEY ARE ENFORCED INCORRECTLY

00:44:13.284 --> 00:44:16.988 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED WE BELIEVE THAT THE

00:44:14.986 --> 00:44:18.422 region:rollup2
CREATION OF A TASK FORCE CAN

00:44:16.988 --> 00:44:19.924 region:rollup2
HELP CATALYZE THIS RESULT.

00:44:18.422 --> 00:44:21.659 region:rollup2
OUR VISION OF THIS TASK FORCE

00:44:19.924 --> 00:44:23.194 region:rollup2
WOULD BEFORE TO GO TO INDIVIDUAL

00:44:21.659 --> 00:44:24.829 region:rollup2
SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND HOPE BUYS

00:44:23.194 --> 00:44:26.430 region:rollup2
THEM ON HOW TO BETTER IMPLEMENT

00:44:24.829 --> 00:44:27.899 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH POLICIES.

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:29.066 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU DO THINGS

00:44:27.899 --> 00:44:30.635 region:rollup2
SUCH AS COMPILING A LIST OF

00:44:29.066 --> 00:44:31.202 region:rollup2
BREAST BEST PRACTICES IN

00:44:30.635 --> 00:44:32.937 region:rollup2
DISSEMINATING THEM TO OTHER

00:44:31.202 --> 00:44:34.438 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS.

00:44:32.937 --> 00:44:35.640 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT A REVIEW OF MENTAL

00:44:34.438 --> 00:44:37.074 region:rollup2
HEALTH CURRICULA WOULD BE ABLE

00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:38.876 region:rollup2
TO TACKLE THE PROBLEM AT ITS

00:44:37.074 --> 00:44:40.278 region:rollup2
ROOT IN EQUIP STUDENTS WITH THE

00:44:38.876 --> 00:44:41.579 region:rollup2
TOOLS NECESSARY TO COMBAT THE

00:44:40.278 --> 00:44:43.014 region:rollup2
PROBLEM BEFORE IT MANIFEST

00:44:41.579 --> 00:44:44.348 region:rollup2
ITSELF IN HIGH SCHOOL. IN

00:44:43.014 --> 00:44:45.516 region:rollup2
ADDITION WE BELIEVE THAT THERE

00:44:44.348 --> 00:44:47.184 region:rollup2
ARE THREE IMPORTANT BENEFITS TO

00:44:45.516 --> 00:44:48.786 region:rollup2
THIS COURSE OF ACTION.

00:44:47.184 --> 00:44:50.421 region:rollup2
FIRST THE AGE AT WHICH MOST

00:44:48.786 --> 00:44:51.789 region:rollup2
PEOPLE GO TO MIDDLE SCHOOL IS

00:44:50.421 --> 00:44:53.758 region:rollup2
USUALLY FORMATIVE AND I SUCH

00:44:51.789 --> 00:44:55.193 region:rollup2
PEDAGOGICAL EXPERIENCES AT THIS

00:44:53.758 --> 00:44:56.460 region:rollup2
TIME HAVE LONG LASTING IMPACTS

00:44:55.193 --> 00:44:57.762 region:rollup2
BOTHHELPED SHAPE THE WAY

00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:59.163 region:rollup2
STUDENTS VIEW AND THEIR

00:44:57.762 --> 00:45:00.565 region:rollup2
SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS TOWARDS.

00:44:59.163 --> 00:45:01.966 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH

00:45:00.565 --> 00:45:03.367 region:rollup2
YOU SECOND WE THINK THAT

00:45:01.966 --> 00:45:05.336 region:rollup2
TEACHING STUDENTS TO IDENTIFY

00:45:03.367 --> 00:45:06.871 region:rollup2
IMPROPERLY RESPOND TO OTHERS WHO

00:45:05.336 --> 00:45:08.306 region:rollup2
ARE STRUGGLING WITH THEIR MENTAL

00:45:06.871 --> 00:45:09.874 region:rollup2
HEALTH WILL HELP KNIT TOGETHER A

00:45:08.306 --> 00:45:11.809 region:rollup2
HAPPIER AND HEALTHIER STUDENT

00:45:09.874 --> 00:45:13.444 region:rollup2
BODY. AND THIRD WE THINK THAT

00:45:11.809 --> 00:45:15.079 region:rollup2
THE SCIENCE BASED PERSPECTIVE

00:45:13.444 --> 00:45:16.881 region:rollup2
THAT THE CURRICULA CALLS FOR

00:45:15.079 --> 00:45:18.282 region:rollup2
WOULD WITH HELP DE STIGMATIZE

00:45:16.881 --> 00:45:20.218 region:rollup2
AND DE MYSTIFY MENTAL HEALTH

00:45:18.282 --> 00:45:21.719 region:rollup2
MUCH LIKE HOW WIDESPREAD SEXUAL

00:45:20.218 --> 00:45:23.487 region:rollup2
EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS IN THE PAST

00:45:21.719 --> 00:45:25.556 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF DECADES. HOPE REMOVE

00:45:23.487 --> 00:45:27.959 region:rollup2
THE TABOO AGAINST TALKING ABOUT

00:45:25.556 --> 00:45:29.627 region:rollup2
SEXUALITY IN INTEREST.

00:45:27.959 --> 00:45:31.162 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THAT THE COST TO

00:45:29.627 --> 00:45:33.030 region:rollup2
CONVENE THIS TAX FORCED WOULD BE

00:45:31.162 --> 00:45:34.865 region:rollup2
NEAR TO NOTHING.

00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:36.567 region:rollup2
SAVE FOR STIPEND EXPENSES SUCH

00:45:34.865 --> 00:45:37.668 region:rollup2
AS TRAVEL AND MEALS.

00:45:36.567 --> 00:45:38.669 region:rollup2
A WORD THE COST FOR THE

00:45:37.668 --> 00:45:41.572 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL OF THIS PROGRAM HOUSE

00:45:38.669 --> 00:45:43.507 region:rollup2
FOR SAVING LIVES.

00:45:41.572 --> 00:45:45.242 region:rollup2
DEPRESSION IS A PROBLEM THAT IS

00:45:43.507 --> 00:45:47.478 region:rollup2
STRIKINGLY PREVALENT. AND

00:45:45.242 --> 00:45:49.146 region:rollup2
PERSONAL TO MANY OF US.

00:45:47.478 --> 00:45:51.415 region:rollup2
IT'S AFFECTS RIPPLE ACROSS THE

00:45:49.146 --> 00:45:53.451 region:rollup2
ENTIRE SCHOOL COMMUNITY. AND FAR

00:45:51.415 --> 00:45:55.286 region:rollup2
FAR BEYOND.

00:45:53.451 --> 00:45:56.687 region:rollup2
ONE OF OUR DELEGATES RECENTLY

00:45:55.286 --> 00:45:59.390 region:rollup2
SHARED AN EXPERIENCE OF THEIRS

00:45:56.687 --> 00:46:01.292 region:rollup2
AFTER A SUICIDE AT THEIR SCHOOL.

00:45:59.390 --> 00:46:03.327 region:rollup2
THE PERSON WHO COMMITTED SUICIDE

00:46:01.292 --> 00:46:04.295 region:rollup2
WAS A THIRTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL.

00:46:03.327 --> 00:46:05.796 region:rollup2
THIS GIRL WAS JUST LIKE THE REST

00:46:04.295 --> 00:46:06.931 region:rollup2
OF US.

00:46:05.796 --> 00:46:08.799 region:rollup2
SHE LIVED A NORMAL LIFE AND HAD

00:46:06.931 --> 00:46:09.900 region:rollup2
FRIENDS.

00:46:08.799 --> 00:46:12.570 region:rollup2
SHE STARTED DEVELOPING

00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:14.939 region:rollup2
DEPRESSION AFTER BEING BULLIED.

00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:17.208 region:rollup2
EVERYDAY SHE BEGAN TO FEEL

00:46:14.939 --> 00:46:20.278 region:rollup2
INCREASINGLY MORE ALONE.

00:46:17.208 --> 00:46:21.512 region:rollup2
MORE ISOLATED FROM SOCIETY.

00:46:20.278 --> 00:46:24.248 region:rollup2
THIS DEPRESSION BEGAN TO MAKE

00:46:21.512 --> 00:46:26.284 region:rollup2
HER LIFE FEEL WORTHLESS.

00:46:24.248 --> 00:46:28.119 region:rollup2
SINCE SHE WAS NEVER EDUCATED ON

00:46:26.284 --> 00:46:30.454 region:rollup2
HOW TO HANDLE THESE SITUATIONS

00:46:28.119 --> 00:46:31.455 region:rollup2
SHE CONTINUED TO GET WORSE.

00:46:30.454 --> 00:46:32.590 region:rollup2
I AM AWARE OF THE RESOURCES SHE

00:46:31.455 --> 00:46:33.157 region:rollup2
HAD.

00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:35.526 region:rollup2
SHE DECIDED TO TAKE HER OWN

00:46:33.157 --> 00:46:37.662 region:rollup2
LIFE.

00:46:35.526 --> 00:46:39.830 region:rollup2
THIS GIRL IS JUST ONE OF MANY

00:46:37.662 --> 00:46:41.632 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES OF WHY MENTAL HEALTH

00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:42.633 region:rollup2
AWARENESS NEEDS TO BE A PRIORITY

00:46:41.632 --> 00:46:44.235 region:rollup2
FOR THE CALIFORNIA EDUCATION

00:46:42.633 --> 00:46:46.270 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

00:46:44.235 --> 00:46:48.039 region:rollup2
TO REITERATE.

00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:49.307 region:rollup2
WE URGE EVERYONE ON THE

00:46:48.039 --> 00:46:51.475 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER OUR

00:46:49.307 --> 00:46:52.777 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION TO CREATE A TASK

00:46:51.475 --> 00:46:54.245 region:rollup2
FORCE TO EVALUATE THE

00:46:52.777 --> 00:46:56.614 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION OF MENTAL HEALTH

00:46:54.245 --> 00:46:58.549 region:rollup2
STANDARDS. AND CONSIDER.

00:46:56.614 --> 00:47:01.185 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS TO REMEDY THIS FLAW IN

00:46:58.549 --> 00:47:01.919 region:rollup2
OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM.

00:47:01.185 --> 00:47:04.021 region:rollup2
CREATING THE TASK FORCE HAS

00:47:01.919 --> 00:47:06.457 region:rollup2
MINIMAL COSTS.

00:47:04.021 --> 00:47:07.591 region:rollup2
AND POSES NO RISK.

00:47:06.457 --> 00:47:08.959 region:rollup2
MORE IMPORTANTLY IT HAS THE

00:47:07.591 --> 00:47:11.095 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL TO EDUCATE FUTURE

00:47:08.959 --> 00:47:12.663 region:rollup2
GENERATIONS.

00:47:11.095 --> 00:47:15.466 region:rollup2
HELP OTHERS UNDERSTAND HOW THE

00:47:12.663 --> 00:47:15.1000 region:rollup2
MIND WORKS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY

00:47:15.466 --> 00:47:18.736 region:rollup2
SAVE THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT

00:47:15.1000 --> 00:47:19.937 region:rollup2
LIVES.

00:47:18.736 --> 00:47:22.106 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND WE

00:47:19.937 --> 00:47:23.441 region:rollup2

GREAT THANK YOU AND.

00:47:23.441 --> 00:47:27.611 region:rollup2
A VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC.

00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:29.046 region:rollup2
ONE THAT'S GROWING IMPORTANCE

00:47:27.611 --> 00:47:30.848 region:rollup2
EVERYDAY IN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC

00:47:29.046 --> 00:47:32.216 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS AND ACTUALLY BEYOND. AND

00:47:30.848 --> 00:47:34.085 region:rollup2
ONE THAT I THINK SEEING MORE

00:47:32.216 --> 00:47:36.620 region:rollup2
ATTENTION TODAY THAT IT HAS BUT

00:47:34.085 --> 00:47:38.589 region:rollup2
NEEDS MORE WORK.

00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:40.291 region:rollup2
MYSELF I.

00:47:38.589 --> 00:47:42.193 region:rollup2
SPONSOR AUTHORED A BILL A COUPLE

00:47:40.291 --> 00:47:44.195 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO THAT WOULD HAVE SET UP

00:47:42.193 --> 00:47:45.229 region:rollup2
PROTOCOL SO THE SCHOOL SITE WHAT

00:47:44.195 --> 00:47:46.664 region:rollup2
I MEAN BY PROTOCOLS MEANING

00:47:45.229 --> 00:47:48.099 region:rollup2
THEY'VE. EVERYBODY WOULD HAVE

00:47:46.664 --> 00:47:49.633 region:rollup2
KNOWN THEIR ROLE IF THERE WAS A

00:47:48.099 --> 00:47:51.035 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH INCIDENT THAT HAVE

00:47:49.633 --> 00:47:52.737 region:rollup2
BEEN REPORTED BY A TEACHER.

00:47:51.035 --> 00:47:54.004 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WHAT I FOUND IS A CLASS

00:47:52.737 --> 00:47:55.339 region:rollup2
OUR TEACHER THAT I WOULD GO TO A

00:47:54.004 --> 00:47:56.841 region:rollup2
COUNSELOR HEY I THINK THE

00:47:55.339 --> 00:47:58.008 region:rollup2
STUDENTS GOT SOME SOME MENTAL

00:47:56.841 --> 00:47:58.709 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT.

00:47:58.008 --> 00:48:00.578 region:rollup2
AND.

00:47:58.709 --> 00:48:01.746 region:rollup2
WHAT I FOUND WAS A COUNSELOR

00:48:00.578 --> 00:48:04.415 region:rollup2
DIDN'T NECESSARILY KNOW WHAT TO

00:48:01.746 --> 00:48:06.117 region:rollup2
DO WITH THE INFORMATION I HAD

00:48:04.415 --> 00:48:08.719 region:rollup2
DELIVERED? TO THAT COUNCIL NOW

00:48:06.117 --> 00:48:10.020 region:rollup2
WHAT WE DON'T WANT IS US I'M NOT

00:48:08.719 --> 00:48:11.789 region:rollup2
A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL I

00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:12.423 region:rollup2
CAN'T DIAGNOSE.

00:48:11.789 --> 00:48:12.623 region:rollup2
AND I CAN'T TREAT WE DON'T WANT

00:48:12.423 --> 00:48:14.692 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:48:12.623 --> 00:48:15.693 region:rollup2
OKAY.

00:48:14.692 --> 00:48:17.328 region:rollup2
BUT WE WANT A TEACHER TO BE A

00:48:15.693 --> 00:48:18.329 region:rollup2
PARTNER.

00:48:17.328 --> 00:48:19.830 region:rollup2
AND OR AN EDUCATOR TO BE A

00:48:18.329 --> 00:48:21.532 region:rollup2
PARTNER.

00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:23.033 region:rollup2
AND GETTING A STUDENT SERVICES

00:48:21.532 --> 00:48:24.235 region:rollup2
IF THEY NEED THEM. AND WHAT I

00:48:23.033 --> 00:48:25.669 region:rollup2
FOUND WAS WE JUST DIDN'T HAVE

00:48:24.235 --> 00:48:27.204 region:rollup2
THE PROTOCOLS WHO DID WHAT

00:48:25.669 --> 00:48:28.572 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHED SO I OFFERED A BILL

00:48:27.204 --> 00:48:29.173 region:rollup2
THAT MADE IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH

00:48:28.572 --> 00:48:29.874 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS ON THE GOVERNOR'S

00:48:29.173 --> 00:48:30.875 region:rollup2
DESK.

00:48:29.874 --> 00:48:32.877 region:rollup2
HE VETOED IT.

00:48:30.875 --> 00:48:34.311 region:rollup2
.

00:48:32.877 --> 00:48:35.613 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT WE DID GAY I GET

00:48:34.311 --> 00:48:37.047 region:rollup2
THROUGH OUR LAST YEAR WAS A BILL

00:48:35.613 --> 00:48:39.016 region:rollup2
THAT SPOKE TO SUICIDE MAKING

00:48:37.047 --> 00:48:40.618 region:rollup2
THAT PART OF THE SCHOOL PLAN.

MENTAL HEALTH AMONG STUDENTS IS

00:50:39.937 --> 00:50:42.940 region:rollup2

HEARING ON MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES

00:50:58.088 --> 00:51:02.426 region:rollup2

AT BECAUSE I THINK.

00:51:06.797 --> 00:51:10.067 region:rollup2
.

00:51:08.632 --> 00:51:11.368 region:rollup2
CHOOL HEALTH IS EXTREMELY HOW

00:51:10.067 --> 00:51:12.536 region:rollup2
TO VOTER HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN

00:51:11.368 --> 00:51:14.204 region:rollup2
SCHOOL IN FACT WHEN OTHER THINGS

00:51:12.536 --> 00:51:16.640 region:rollup2
I ALSO WANT TO MENTION.

00:51:14.204 --> 00:51:17.942 region:rollup2
IS THAT I KNOW THAT BOTH THE

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:18.943 region:rollup2
SUMMER WE GONNA A DONALD I I'VE

00:51:17.942 --> 00:51:20.744 region:rollup2
BEEN WORKING ON TRYING TO FIGURE

00:51:18.943 --> 00:51:23.514 region:rollup2
OUT HOW CAN WE DRAW DOWN MORE

00:51:20.744 --> 00:51:25.115 region:rollup2
FUNDS FOR HEALTH SERVICES AND IN

00:51:23.514 --> 00:51:26.550 region:rollup2
SCHOOL INCLUDING MENTAL HEALTH.

00:51:25.115 --> 00:51:28.319 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT BECAUSE.

00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:30.087 region:rollup2
I APPRECIATE YOUR PROPOSAL FOR

00:51:28.319 --> 00:51:32.923 region:rollup2
TASK FORCE.

00:51:30.087 --> 00:51:34.892 region:rollup2
BUT I'M SURE YOU ALSO RECOGNIZE

00:51:32.923 --> 00:51:36.126 region:rollup2
A TASK FORCE IN ITSELF AND I

00:51:34.892 --> 00:51:37.695 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT YOU TESTIFY WILL

00:51:36.126 --> 00:51:40.831 region:rollup2
DOESN'T TAKE MUCH MONEY. IS

00:51:37.695 --> 00:51:42.433 region:rollup2
MERELY A TASK FORCE AND IN FACT.

00:51:40.831 --> 00:51:44.101 region:rollup2
IF WE WANT THE TASK FORCE TO

00:51:42.433 --> 00:51:44.602 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY MAKE A CHANGE WERE

00:51:44.101 --> 00:51:46.070 region:rollup2
EVENTUALLY HAVE TO MOVE

00:51:44.602 --> 00:51:47.571 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION.

00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:48.405 region:rollup2
SO WE CAN HAVE TASK FORCE TO

00:51:47.571 --> 00:51:49.807 region:rollup2
REVIEW THINGS BUT EVENTUALLY

00:51:48.405 --> 00:51:51.108 region:rollup2
AFTER GOT COMPLEMENTATION RIGHT

00:51:49.807 --> 00:51:52.076 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE GET THOSE MENTAL

00:51:51.108 --> 00:51:53.510 region:rollup2
HEALTH SERVICES ANY OF A

00:51:52.076 --> 00:51:55.145 region:rollup2
STANDARD RIGHT HOW DO YOU

00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:56.080 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT THOSE STANDARDS.

00:51:55.145 --> 00:51:57.081 region:rollup2
SOMEONE'S YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING

00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:58.682 region:rollup2
TO HAVE TO HAVE MEDICAL HELP.

00:51:57.081 --> 00:51:59.683 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS

00:51:58.682 --> 00:52:01.385 region:rollup2
FACT I ACTUALLY AUTHORED A BILLS

00:51:59.683 --> 00:52:02.953 region:rollup2
OVER YEARS AGO AYE FOR PILOT

00:52:01.385 --> 00:52:04.321 region:rollup2
PROGRAM THE. WHERE WE WOULD GET

00:52:02.953 --> 00:52:05.689 region:rollup2
A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL AND

00:52:04.321 --> 00:52:07.624 region:rollup2
THAT'S IT IT IN IN THE IN THE

00:52:05.689 --> 00:52:08.792 region:rollup2
PILOT SCHOOLS? TO SO THAT HELP

00:52:07.624 --> 00:52:10.561 region:rollup2
STUDENTS BE REGULAR.

00:52:08.792 --> 00:52:12.563 region:rollup2
THAT WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A

00:52:10.561 --> 00:52:14.932 region:rollup2
LARGE PORTION OF US STUDENTS IN

00:52:12.563 --> 00:52:16.166 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS TO HAVE.

00:52:14.932 --> 00:52:16.934 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES

00:52:16.166 --> 00:52:18.035 region:rollup2
AS WELL AND.

00:52:16.934 --> 00:52:19.370 region:rollup2
SO THEY COULD BE SITTING IN THE

00:52:18.035 --> 00:52:21.772 region:rollup2
CLASSROOM.

00:52:19.370 --> 00:52:23.340 region:rollup2
BUT THEY MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE

00:52:21.772 --> 00:52:25.009 region:rollup2
FOCUSED ON WHAT'S BEING TAUGHT

00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:26.477 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES

00:52:25.009 --> 00:52:27.878 region:rollup2
IN THERE. AND IF THE SCHOOL IS

00:52:26.477 --> 00:52:30.347 region:rollup2
NOT.

00:52:27.878 --> 00:52:32.549 region:rollup2
PAIRED TO TRY TO DEAL WITH THEM

00:52:30.347 --> 00:52:34.585 region:rollup2
ARE TO ADDRESS THEM THEN.

00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:35.319 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT THERE NOT LEARNING

00:52:34.585 --> 00:52:36.620 region:rollup2
AND.

00:52:35.319 --> 00:52:38.155 region:rollup2
THAT'S THAT THEN.

00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:38.922 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S A PROBLEM FOR THE

00:52:38.155 --> 00:52:40.658 region:rollup2
STUDENT THAT'S PROB FOR THE

00:52:38.922 --> 00:52:42.092 region:rollup2
SCHOOL THE MOST POORLY FOR THE

00:52:40.658 --> 00:52:44.128 region:rollup2
STUDENT AND THEN OF COURSE. WHEN

00:52:42.092 --> 00:52:46.497 region:rollup2
YOU START TALKING THE MORE.

00:52:44.128 --> 00:52:47.965 region:rollup2
EXT NOW. ELSEVIER AND RIGHT YOU

00:52:46.497 --> 00:52:49.667 region:rollup2
HAVE STUDENTS WHO ARE IN SUCH.

00:52:47.965 --> 00:52:50.834 region:rollup2
PAIN.

00:52:49.667 --> 00:52:52.603 region:rollup2
THAT DAY.

00:52:50.834 --> 00:52:54.304 region:rollup2
HURT THEMSELVES OR EVEN TAKE ON

00:52:52.603 --> 00:52:54.738 region:rollup2
LIVES RIGHT WHICH HAS A DRAMATIC

00:52:54.304 --> 00:52:56.106 region:rollup2
IMPACT ON.

00:52:54.738 --> 00:52:58.275 region:rollup2
EVERYONE.

00:52:56.106 --> 00:53:00.711 region:rollup2
AND SO WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW

00:52:58.275 --> 00:53:01.779 region:rollup2
TO GET THOSE RESOURCES.

00:53:00.711 --> 00:53:03.947 region:rollup2
TO SCHOOLS AS WELL.

00:53:01.779 --> 00:53:07.284 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO WORK WITH SCHOOLS TO

00:53:03.947 --> 00:53:09.253 region:rollup2
GIVE THEM TO FIGURE HOW DO WE.

00:53:07.284 --> 00:53:09.520 region:rollup2
YOUNG GET PEOPLE TO THE HELP

00:53:09.253 --> 00:53:11.321 region:rollup2
THEY NEED.

00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:13.557 region:rollup2
IT'S

00:53:11.321 --> 00:53:14.324 region:rollup2
ON ONE LEVEL WHAT KIND OF VEIL

00:53:13.557 --> 00:53:15.359 region:rollup2
THINGS AVAILABLE WITHIN THE

00:53:14.324 --> 00:53:16.994 region:rollup2
SCHOOL.

00:53:15.359 --> 00:53:18.696 region:rollup2
AT ANOTHER LEVEL.

00:53:16.994 --> 00:53:19.496 region:rollup2
ALSO YOU MAY THINK ABOUT WHAT

00:53:18.696 --> 00:53:21.532 region:rollup2
OR THINGS THAT.

00:53:19.496 --> 00:53:22.800 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN BUILD LINKAGES

00:53:21.532 --> 00:53:24.735 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THE SCHOOLS OUR

00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:25.869 region:rollup2
EDUCATION SYSTEM AND THAT THE

00:53:24.735 --> 00:53:27.671 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH AND HEALTHCARE

00:53:25.869 --> 00:53:29.540 region:rollup2
SYSTEM AS WELL. RIGHT SO THAT

00:53:27.671 --> 00:53:31.041 region:rollup2
THERE'S CERTAIN CAPACITY WITHIN

00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:32.743 region:rollup2
A SCHOOL SCHOOL PIETISM RUN

00:53:31.041 --> 00:53:34.178 region:rollup2
THEIR OWN. TALENT AND AND WHAT

00:53:32.743 --> 00:53:36.480 region:rollup2
WE DO WE INSURE THAT THEY CAN

00:53:34.178 --> 00:53:38.749 region:rollup2
GET HELP BEYOND SO I I THINK

00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:40.451 region:rollup2
THAT CERTAINLY.

00:53:38.749 --> 00:53:40.918 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT AT.

00:53:40.451 --> 00:53:41.852 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO HAVE THAT

00:53:40.918 --> 00:53:43.687 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION WE ACTUALLY ARE

00:53:41.852 --> 00:53:44.922 region:rollup2
HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS SO I

00:53:43.687 --> 00:53:45.622 region:rollup2
THINK OVERLY THAT'S GOOD NEWS TO

00:53:44.922 --> 00:53:46.090 region:rollup2
YOU.

00:53:45.622 --> 00:53:48.625 region:rollup2
WE ARE HAVING THOSE

WHAT? WHAT'S YOUR SENSE OF MEN

00:57:05.322 --> 00:57:08.225 region:rollup2
IN THEIR IN THE RESEARCH THAT

00:57:06.356 --> 00:57:09.226 region:rollup2

OF THE INVESTIGATION OF THIS

00:57:16.867 --> 00:57:19.136 region:rollup2
ISSUE AT THE DEPARTMENT DUCATION

00:57:17.968 --> 00:57:21.772 region:rollup2

00:57:19.136 --> 00:57:22.939 region:rollup2
I'M.

00:57:21.772 --> 00:57:24.941 region:rollup2
WHAT IS IT ABOUT TASK FORCE YOU

00:57:22.939 --> 00:57:26.076 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S GOING TO?

00:57:24.941 --> 00:57:27.311 region:rollup2
MAKE THINGS BETTER AS THE AS TO

00:57:26.076 --> 00:57:29.713 region:rollup2
HOW THE STATE.

00:57:27.311 --> 00:57:31.915 region:rollup2
APPROACH TO THIS PROBLEM.

00:57:29.713 --> 00:57:33.517 region:rollup2
WE THINK ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS

00:57:31.915 --> 00:57:34.985 region:rollup2
JUST A LACK OF EDUCATION THAT

00:57:33.517 --> 00:57:36.820 region:rollup2
THE STATE ACTUALLY HIGHS MENTAL

00:57:34.985 --> 00:57:37.854 region:rollup2
HEALTH GUIDELINES. SO YESTERDAY

00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:39.823 region:rollup2
WHEN WE WERE RESEARCHING WE'RE

00:57:37.854 --> 00:57:40.757 region:rollup2
ALL IN ONE ROOM AND NONE OF US

00:57:39.823 --> 00:57:42.259 region:rollup2
KNEW THAT.

00:57:40.757 --> 00:57:44.027 region:rollup2
TO STAY ACTUALLY HAS GUILIN'S

00:57:42.259 --> 00:57:44.761 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT DIFFERENT COUNTY

00:57:44.027 --> 00:57:45.395 region:rollup2
SHOULD DO.

00:57:44.761 --> 00:57:47.397 region:rollup2
ON MENTAL.

00:57:45.395 --> 00:57:48.799 region:rollup2
ON MENTAL HEALTH BECAUSE OUT OF

00:57:47.397 --> 00:57:50.233 region:rollup2
THE ELEVEN US OUT OF US IN THE

00:57:48.799 --> 00:57:51.768 region:rollup2
ROOM ONLY ONE OF US HAD ACTUALLY

00:57:50.233 --> 00:57:53.003 region:rollup2
BEEN TAUGHT ANYTHING TO DO WITH

00:57:51.768 --> 00:57:54.538 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH YOU KNOW IN OUR

00:57:53.003 --> 00:57:56.807 region:rollup2
HEALTH CLASSES OR IN OUR. MIDDLE

00:57:54.538 --> 00:57:58.241 region:rollup2
SCHOOL HEALTH EDUCATION SO WE

00:57:56.807 --> 00:57:59.943 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THE TASK FORCE CAN GO

00:57:58.241 --> 00:58:01.812 region:rollup2
AROUND TO VARIOUS DISTRICTS AND

00:57:59.943 --> 00:58:03.680 region:rollup2
SIMPLY IN ELECTED LOCAL SCHOOL

00:58:01.812 --> 00:58:05.015 region:rollup2
BOARDS OR LET LOCAL SCHOOLS KNOW

00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:06.316 region:rollup2
THAT THESE GUIDELINES EXIST AND

00:58:05.015 --> 00:58:07.851 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ARE YOU KNOW CERTAIN

00:58:06.316 --> 00:58:09.686 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY.

00:58:07.851 --> 00:58:12.990 region:rollup2
SHOULD OR ARE ENCOURAGED TO

00:58:09.686 --> 00:58:16.626 region:rollup2
MEET OUR TO KIND OF HOPE ALLOW

00:58:12.990 --> 00:58:17.928 region:rollup2
FOR BETTER MENTAL HEALTH OF

00:58:16.626 --> 00:58:19.162 region:rollup2
THEIR STUDENT BODY OVERALL.

00:58:17.928 --> 00:58:20.263 region:rollup2
SO TO ADD ON TO THAT WHAT I WAS

00:58:19.162 --> 00:58:21.498 region:rollup2
THINKING WAS THAT THE TASK FORCE

00:58:20.263 --> 00:58:22.899 region:rollup2
IS REVIEWING THIS AND THEN THEY

00:58:21.498 --> 00:58:24.434 region:rollup2
ARE HELPING IMPLEMENT THIS THEY

00:58:22.899 --> 00:58:26.703 region:rollup2
ARE SHOWING THESE.

00:58:24.434 --> 00:58:28.538 region:rollup2
SPOTS IN THE THE SPOTS IN THE

00:58:26.703 --> 00:58:30.474 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS WHERE THIS IS NOT

00:58:28.538 --> 00:58:31.942 region:rollup2
BEING IMPLEMENTED AND HOW JUST

00:58:30.474 --> 00:58:33.443 region:rollup2

NEED TO BE IMPLEMENTED FOR

00:58:37.814 --> 00:58:40.817 region:rollup2

I THINK THAT.

01:16:01.624 --> 01:16:05.895 region:rollup2

CREATING MAY BE. A.

01:16:33.122 --> 01:16:40.262 region:rollup2
MAYBE LIKE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE

FACT THAT.

01:16:55.077 --> 01:16:56.912 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT TURN OVER WITH

AND ONE OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED

01:17:35.184 --> 01:17:38.587 region:rollup2
WAS THAT OUR SCHOOLS ACTUALLY.

01:17:36.819 --> 01:17:39.555 region:rollup2

BE BUILT A NEW DRAMA DEPARTMENT

01:17:52.968 --> 01:17:55.704 region:rollup2
NEW BUILDINGS FOR PLACING THE

01:17:53.936 --> 01:17:57.439 region:rollup2

STATIONS AGO ALONG THE WALLS AND

01:17:57.439 --> 01:18:00.109 region:rollup2

01:17:58.974 --> 01:18:01.677 region:rollup2
BEING ONE OF THE YOUNGEST PEOPLE

01:18:00.109 --> 01:18:03.779 region:rollup2

CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION.

01:23:55.797 --> 01:23:59.268 region:rollup2
IN ESSENCE THE NEWCOMER PROGRAM%

THE UNITED STATES.

01:24:30.599 --> 01:24:33.869 region:rollup2
THE IDEA OF THE NEWCOMER PROGRAM

INTO THEIR SCHOOL COMMUNITIES.

01:24:39.608 --> 01:24:42.010 region:rollup2
WHEN ASSESSING THE RECENT

01:24:40.676 --> 01:24:43.745 region:rollup2
POLITICAL CLIMATE THAT PROMOTES

01:24:42.010 --> 01:24:45.213 region:rollup2
ANTI IMMIGRANT SENTIMENT

01:24:43.745 --> 01:24:46.448 region:rollup2
IMMIGRANT STUDENTS DO NOT FEEL

01:24:45.213 --> 01:24:47.849 region:rollup2
SAFE AND IT IS UP TO THE

01:24:46.448 --> 01:24:49.818 region:rollup2
EDUCATORS OF CALIFORNIA TO

PROVIDE THAT SUPPORT.

01:24:49.818 --> 01:24:53.121 region:rollup2
IDEALLY THE NEWCOMER PROGRAM

01:24:51.553 --> 01:24:54.957 region:rollup2
PROVIDES A SAFE SPACE THROUGH

01:24:53.121 --> 01:24:56.758 region:rollup2

TRAUMA WHEN THIS ANTI IMMIGRANT

01:24:59.795 --> 01:25:02.931 region:rollup2
SENTIMENT IS EXPRESSED BY

01:25:01.063 --> 01:25:04.232 region:rollup2
POLITICAL FIGURES.

AFFECTED STUDENTS.

01:25:11.340 --> 01:25:15.077 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY WHILE ELL CLASSES

01:25:13.408 --> 01:25:15.877 region:rollup2
AND PROGRAMS ARE IN EFFECT IN

01:25:15.077 --> 01:25:17.245 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS

NEWCOMER PROGRAM.

01:25:22.618 --> 01:25:25.754 region:rollup2
COMMON ISSUES OF THE YELLOW

01:25:23.919 --> 01:25:26.888 region:rollup2
COURSES IN CALIFORNIA ARE THAT

01:25:25.754 --> 01:25:28.390 region:rollup2
STUDENTS FEEL STOCK AND

EXCEL AND EVENTUALLY PASSED THE

01:25:34.763 --> 01:25:37.232 region:rollup2
ILA COURSES.

01:25:36.098 --> 01:25:38.667 region:rollup2
THIS IS PROVEN TO HAVE A

01:25:37.232 --> 01:25:40.235 region:rollup2
POSITIVE EFFECT IN THE OAKLAND

01:25:38.667 --> 01:25:41.370 region:rollup2
UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT BECAUSE

01:25:40.235 --> 01:25:43.238 region:rollup2
THERE HAS BEEN A THIRTEEN

01:25:41.370 --> 01:25:44.873 region:rollup2
PERCENT INCREASE IN GRADUATION

01:25:43.238 --> 01:25:46.074 region:rollup2
RATE OF ELL STUDENTS WHO ARE

01:25:44.873 --> 01:25:48.310 region:rollup2
ALSO INVOLVED IN THE NEWCOMER

01:25:46.074 --> 01:25:49.945 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:50.846 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS ACADEMIC EDUCATION

01:25:49.945 --> 01:25:52.681 region:rollup2
THE NEWCOMER PROGRAM WOULD

01:25:50.846 --> 01:25:54.650 region:rollup2
EDUCATE UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS ON

01:25:52.681 --> 01:25:56.651 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS OF DOCUMENTATION AND

01:25:54.650 --> 01:25:58.153 region:rollup2
ASSIST THEM IN THAT PROCESS.

01:25:56.651 --> 01:25:59.621 region:rollup2
WE UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS BOTH A

01:25:58.153 --> 01:26:01.423 region:rollup2
LEGAL AND INSENSITIVE FOR

01:25:59.621 --> 01:26:03.158 region:rollup2
EDUCATORS TO APPROACH STUDENTS

01:26:01.423 --> 01:26:04.726 region:rollup2
ABOUT THEIR DOCUMENTATION STATUS

01:26:03.158 --> 01:26:06.962 region:rollup2
AND THEREFORE THIS WORKSHOP IS

01:26:04.726 --> 01:26:08.730 region:rollup2
OPTIONAL. AND IS INTENDED AS A

01:26:06.962 --> 01:26:10.832 region:rollup2
SAFE TOOL AND HAVEN FOR STUDENTS

01:26:08.730 --> 01:26:12.167 region:rollup2
LOOKING FOR THIS HELP.

01:26:10.832 --> 01:26:13.835 region:rollup2
FINALLY THE NEWCOMER PROGRAM

01:26:12.167 --> 01:26:15.404 region:rollup2
WOULD STAND AS AN ADVOCACY

01:26:13.835 --> 01:26:17.139 region:rollup2
PROGRAM THAT DE STIGMATIZE IS

01:26:15.404 --> 01:26:19.074 region:rollup2

ASSUMPTIONS THAT SURROUND THEM.

01:26:19.074 --> 01:26:21.943 region:rollup2
AS A CHILD OF IMMIGRANTS I

01:26:20.709 --> 01:26:23.278 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE SHAME THAT ONE

01:26:21.943 --> 01:26:24.746 region:rollup2
CAN FEEL ONE CLASSIFIED AS AN

01:26:23.278 --> 01:26:26.014 region:rollup2

IMMIGRANTS.

01:26:28.350 --> 01:26:31.353 region:rollup2
THE NEWCOMER PROGRAM WOULD

01:26:29.518 --> 01:26:33.355 region:rollup2
CREATE A RIPPLE EFFECT OF DE

01:26:36.458 --> 01:26:40.062 region:rollup2
SINCE NEWCOMER PROGRAM WAS IN

01:26:40.062 --> 01:26:42.831 region:rollup2
DISTRICT IT HAS BEEN REPORTED

01:26:41.730 --> 01:26:44.399 region:rollup2
THAT A STUDENT WOULD ONLY BE

01:26:42.831 --> 01:26:46.334 region:rollup2
INVOLVED IN THE NEWCOMER PROGRAM

01:26:44.399 --> 01:26:47.235 region:rollup2
FOR ONE TO TWO YEARS.

01:26:46.334 --> 01:26:48.503 region:rollup2
FOLLOWING THEIR TIME THE

01:26:47.235 --> 01:26:50.238 region:rollup2
NEWCOMER PROGRAM THE STUDENT

01:26:48.503 --> 01:26:51.473 region:rollup2
WOULD BE INTEGRATED INTO REGULAR

THIS STATISTIC ALONG WITH MANY

01:27:17.332 --> 01:27:21.336 region:rollup2
OTHERS PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR WHY

01:27:19.301 --> 01:27:23.305 region:rollup2
AND HOW THE NEWCOMER PROGRAM HAS

01:27:21.336 --> 01:27:24.406 region:rollup2
BEEN SO EFFECTIVE IN OAKLAND.

01:27:23.305 --> 01:27:26.108 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

01:27:24.406 --> 01:27:27.409 region:rollup2

01:27:26.108 --> 01:27:29.644 region:rollup2
IMMIGRANT STUDENTS AS A PRIORITY

01:27:27.409 --> 01:27:31.413 region:rollup2

01:27:39.121 --> 01:27:41.857 region:rollup2
RESULTS IN CHANGING THE WAY THE

01:27:44.426 --> 01:27:48.130 region:rollup2
THE NEWCOMER PROGRAM WE ARE

01:27:46.161 --> 01:27:49.331 region:rollup2
PROPOSING IS NOT A NEW IDEA.

01:27:48.130 --> 01:27:50.732 region:rollup2
OAKLAND UNIFIED HAS SEEN

01:27:49.331 --> 01:27:52.134 region:rollup2
MEASURABLE SUCCESS WITH THESE

01:27:50.732 --> 01:27:53.368 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS SINCE IMPLEMENTATION

01:27:52.134 --> 01:27:55.837 region:rollup2

01:28:17.726 --> 01:28:20.495 region:rollup2
EXPANDING THE NEWCOMER PROGRAMS

01:28:19.127 --> 01:28:22.330 region:rollup2
OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH

01:28:20.495 --> 01:28:24.032 region:rollup2
LARGE IMMIGRANT POPULATIONS.

01:28:22.330 --> 01:28:24.666 region:rollup2
CAN OFFER THE SAME SERVICES TO

01:28:24.032 --> 01:28:26.401 region:rollup2
THE STUDENTS WHO ARE IN NEED OF

01:28:24.666 --> 01:28:26.668 region:rollup2
IT MOST.

01:28:26.401 --> 01:28:28.570 region:rollup2
EXPANDING.

01:28:26.668 --> 01:28:29.538 region:rollup2
.

01:28:28.570 --> 01:28:30.238 region:rollup2
EXPANDING HIS PROGRAMS COULD

01:28:29.538 --> 01:28:32.040 region:rollup2
OFFER IMMIGRANT STUDENTS

01:28:30.238 --> 01:28:33.675 region:rollup2
RESOURCES THAT WOULD HELP THEM

01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:34.676 region:rollup2
IN COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS

01:28:33.675 --> 01:28:37.179 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO

01:28:34.676 --> 01:28:38.013 region:rollup2
HAVE OTHERWISE.

01:28:37.179 --> 01:28:40.782 region:rollup2
WE ASK THAT THE STATE

01:28:38.013 --> 01:28:41.550 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE ALLOCATE FUNDS DO A

01:28:40.782 --> 01:28:43.752 region:rollup2
COMPETITIVE GRANT APPLICATION

01:28:41.550 --> 01:28:45.320 region:rollup2
PROCESS FROM THIS IMMIGRANT

01:28:43.752 --> 01:28:46.655 region:rollup2
STUDENT EDUCATION PROGRAM. FOR

01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:48.723 region:rollup2
THE CREATION OF THREE PILOT

01:28:46.655 --> 01:28:49.324 region:rollup2
NEWCOMER PROGRAMS OTHER THAN

01:28:48.723 --> 01:28:51.159 region:rollup2
THAT OF OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL

01:28:49.324 --> 01:28:52.327 region:rollup2
DISTRICT.

01:28:51.159 --> 01:28:53.929 region:rollup2
WE HOPE THE GRANTS WOULD COVER

01:28:52.327 --> 01:28:55.630 region:rollup2
MOST OF THE COST BUT IT IS ONLY

01:28:53.929 --> 01:28:57.032 region:rollup2
NATURAL THAT SOME LOCAL COSTS

01:28:55.630 --> 01:28:58.333 region:rollup2
WOULD ALSO BE INCURRED. AND WE

01:28:57.032 --> 01:28:59.100 region:rollup2
PROPOSE AT THESE TALKS BE

01:28:58.333 --> 01:29:01.837 region:rollup2
ALLOCATED FOR IN THE LOCAL

01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:03.805 region:rollup2
CONTROL FUNDING FOR.

01:29:01.837 --> 01:29:05.340 region:rollup2
WE SUGGEST THAT THREE SEPARATE

01:29:03.805 --> 01:29:07.042 region:rollup2
GRANTS BE OFFERED TO DISTRICTS

01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:08.543 region:rollup2
OF A LARGE MEDIUM AND SMALL

01:29:07.042 --> 01:29:10.011 region:rollup2
STUDENT POPULATION. WITH A

01:29:08.543 --> 01:29:10.545 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF THESE

01:29:10.011 --> 01:29:12.013 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS BEING IMMIGRANT

01:29:10.545 --> 01:29:13.481 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

01:29:12.013 --> 01:29:15.083 region:rollup2
TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE NEW

01:29:13.481 --> 01:29:17.152 region:rollup2
PILOT NEWCOMER PROGRAMS AND

01:29:15.083 --> 01:29:18.520 region:rollup2
DETERMINE WHETHER THIS IS.

01:29:17.152 --> 01:29:19.421 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE VIABLE

01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:21.223 region:rollup2
AND BENEFICIAL TO EXPAND ACROSS

01:29:19.421 --> 01:29:22.691 region:rollup2
THE STATE.

01:29:21.223 --> 01:29:24.693 region:rollup2
WE FEEL THAT THE EDUCATION OF

01:29:22.691 --> 01:29:25.160 region:rollup2
IMMIGRANT STUDENTS IS A HIGHEST

01:29:24.693 --> 01:29:26.494 region:rollup2
PRIORITY FOR THE STATE

01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:27.596 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE.

01:29:26.494 --> 01:29:28.864 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WITH TWENTY SEVEN

01:29:27.596 --> 01:29:29.864 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF ALL CALIFORNIA

NOT ADDRESSING THEIR ISSUES

01:29:32.868 --> 01:29:33.935 region:rollup2

IS A FANTASTIC A NEW CAR

01:30:26.821 --> 01:30:31.526 region:rollup2

BUT WE ALSO BACKED IT UP WITH

01:30:50.712 --> 01:30:55.350 region:rollup2
OTHER SPECIFIC ACTIONS. AND SO I

01:30:52.247 --> 01:30:55.850 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA. AND IT.

01:30:55.350 --> 01:30:56.551 region:rollup2
IRONICALLY REFERRING TO

OKLAHOMA'S PROGRAM I THINK ONE

01:30:57.152 --> 01:30:59.387 region:rollup2
OF THE THINGS THAT WOULD REALLY

01:30:58.253 --> 01:31:01.423 region:rollup2

REGARDS TO THEIR LEGAL RIGHTS AS

IMPORTANT WE DON'T DO ENOUGH OF

01:31:05.527 --> 01:31:07.529 region:rollup2
THAT IN GENERAL. IN ARCADE TO

01:31:06.394 --> 01:31:09.164 region:rollup2

FORESTS DIMINISHING RAPIDLY.

01:35:15.076 --> 01:35:19.080 region:rollup2
WE ARE AWARE OF THE PROBLEMS

01:35:17.111 --> 01:35:20.582 region:rollup2
BUT DO NOT RECEIVE EDUCATION ON

01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:23.251 region:rollup2
HOW OUR INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS

01:35:20.582 --> 01:35:25.053 region:rollup2
TRANSLATE TO SOLUTIONS.

01:35:23.251 --> 01:35:27.155 region:rollup2
WE STAND HERE TODAY TO ADDRESS

01:35:25.053 --> 01:35:27.822 region:rollup2
THE NEED IN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM

FOR ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION

01:35:27.822 --> 01:35:30.992 region:rollup2
EDUCATION.

01:35:29.857 --> 01:35:32.493 region:rollup2
IN RECENT YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A

01:35:30.992 --> 01:35:33.561 region:rollup2
PLACE

01:35:32.493 --> 01:35:35.163 region:rollup2
FOR INCREASED ENVIRONMENTAL

01:35:33.561 --> 01:35:36.230 region:rollup2
LITERACY.

01:35:35.163 --> 01:35:38.499 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THE UNDERSTANDING OF

01:35:36.230 --> 01:35:41.703 region:rollup2
OUR NATURAL WORLD.

01:35:38.499 --> 01:35:43.104 region:rollup2
THAT'S THIS WE APPLAUD HOWEVER

01:35:41.703 --> 01:35:45.073 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THAT STUDENTS NEED TO

01:35:43.104 --> 01:35:46.441 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE IMPACTS OF THEIR

01:35:45.073 --> 01:35:48.309 region:rollup2

IN CONTRAST TO ENVIRONMENTAL

01:35:52.113 --> 01:35:55.717 region:rollup2
LITERACY OUR FOCUS IS ON

01:35:53.681 --> 01:35:57.518 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION.

01:35:55.717 --> 01:36:00.421 region:rollup2

01:36:10.465 --> 01:36:13.468 region:rollup2
HOWEVER EDUCATION ON THE MATTER

LEVEL.

01:36:15.737 --> 01:36:18.573 region:rollup2
BUT THE RARE OCCASION THAT A

ALLOWS INDIVIDUALS TO EXPLORE

01:43:42.483 --> 01:43:44.351 region:rollup2
JUST A MINUTE.

01:43:43.117 --> 01:43:45.286 region:rollup2
BUT BUT NO I THINK THIS IS

01:43:44.351 --> 01:43:45.886 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

01:43:45.286 --> 01:43:46.687 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT I

01:43:45.886 --> 01:43:48.189 region:rollup2
HAVE IS THE CHAIR OF THE

01:43:46.687 --> 01:43:49.390 region:rollup2
EDUCATION COMMITTEES ABOUT EVERY

01:43:48.189 --> 01:43:51.392 region:rollup2
YEAR I GET ABOUT FIFTY GOOD

01:43:49.390 --> 01:43:53.060 region:rollup2
IDEAS.

01:43:51.392 --> 01:43:53.894 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND THERE ABOUT WHAT

01:43:53.060 --> 01:43:56.230 region:rollup2
TEACHERS SHOULD DO IN THE

01:43:53.894 --> 01:43:58.399 region:rollup2
CLASSROOM AND THAT THE EDUCATION

01:43:56.230 --> 01:43:59.900 region:rollup2
CODE IS TO STACK UP THE BOOKS IS

01:43:58.399 --> 01:44:01.635 region:rollup2
PROBABLY ABOUT THIS HIGH NOW.

01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:03.437 region:rollup2
AND EVERY YEAR PEOPLE WANT TO

01:44:01.635 --> 01:44:04.371 region:rollup2
GROW THAT BY ABOUT ANOTHER FOOT.

01:44:03.437 --> 01:44:06.273 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM IS THE DAY REALLY

01:44:04.371 --> 01:44:08.042 region:rollup2
DOESN'T GET ANY LONGER.

01:44:06.273 --> 01:44:10.144 region:rollup2
I'M SO ONE OF THE CHALLENGES I

01:44:08.042 --> 01:44:11.245 region:rollup2
HAVE IS IS CUTTING THAT DOWN TO

01:44:10.144 --> 01:44:13.047 region:rollup2
KEEP HERE REASONABLE NOW THE

01:44:11.245 --> 01:44:13.647 region:rollup2
SENATE SIDE THEY WOULD HAVE IN

01:44:13.047 --> 01:44:15.116 region:rollup2
SCHOOL TILL EIGHT O'CLOCK AT

01:44:13.647 --> 01:44:15.649 region:rollup2
NIGHT. BECAUSE THEY DON'T SAY NO

01:44:15.116 --> 01:44:17.952 region:rollup2
TO ANYTHING.

01:44:15.649 --> 01:44:19.753 region:rollup2
.

01:44:17.952 --> 01:44:21.722 region:rollup2
BUT I I'M IN WHAT I TEND TO DO

01:44:19.753 --> 01:44:23.023 region:rollup2
IS SAY GEE WHERE IS THE BALANCE

01:44:21.722 --> 01:44:25.192 region:rollup2
HERE BECAUSE HIS OWN AND ONLY SO

01:44:23.023 --> 01:44:26.427 region:rollup2
MANY MINUTES IN THE DAY BUT I. I

01:44:25.192 --> 01:44:27.728 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THIS IS IMPORTANT

01:44:26.427 --> 01:44:29.463 region:rollup2
BELIEVE SHOULD BE AN EMBEDDED IN

01:44:27.728 --> 01:44:31.499 region:rollup2
EXISTING CLASS

01:44:29.463 --> 01:44:32.833 region:rollup2
WE SHOULDN'T CREATE ANOTHER.

01:44:31.499 --> 01:44:34.468 region:rollup2
OUR REQUIREMENT FOR HIGH SCHOOL

01:44:32.833 --> 01:44:35.269 region:rollup2
GRADUATION I THINK THIS COMPORTS

01:44:34.468 --> 01:44:36.637 region:rollup2
PROBABLY WITH.

01:44:35.269 --> 01:44:38.005 region:rollup2
SCIENCE WHICH I THINK THEY TAKE

01:44:36.637 --> 01:44:41.242 region:rollup2
IN THE NINTH GRADE IF I RECALL

01:44:38.005 --> 01:44:42.543 region:rollup2
CORRECTLY OR SOME OTHER TYPE OF

01:44:41.242 --> 01:44:43.611 region:rollup2
CLASS SO I'M STILL VERY

01:44:42.543 --> 01:44:44.945 region:rollup2
SUPPORTIVE OF THE CONCEPT

01:44:43.611 --> 01:44:46.881 region:rollup2
BECAUSE CALIFORNIA'S BEING

01:44:44.945 --> 01:44:48.783 region:rollup2
IMPACTED BY CLIMATE CHANGE.

01:44:46.881 --> 01:44:50.417 region:rollup2
RIGHT THE FIRES APPEARED THAT

01:44:48.783 --> 01:44:51.952 region:rollup2
MUD SLIDES DOWN THERE THE FIRES

01:44:50.417 --> 01:44:53.454 region:rollup2
DOWN THERE THE FLOODS DOWN THERE

01:44:51.952 --> 01:44:54.922 region:rollup2
OVER HERE. ALL KINDS OF THINGS

01:44:53.454 --> 01:44:56.457 region:rollup2
GOING ON SO APPRECIATE THE

01:44:54.922 --> 01:44:58.092 region:rollup2
RESEARCH VERY WELL RESEARCH VERY

01:44:56.457 --> 01:44:59.560 region:rollup2
WELL THOUGHT OUT A VERY VERY

01:44:58.092 --> 01:45:01.662 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT. REALLY THINK QUESTION

01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:02.797 region:rollup2
IS. REALLY ISN'T SHOULD WE DON'T

01:45:01.662 --> 01:45:04.832 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S HOW.

01:45:02.797 --> 01:45:06.801 region:rollup2
WE DON'T WHERE DO WE PUT.

01:45:04.832 --> 01:45:08.002 region:rollup2
AGAIN WE DON'T JUST ADD THINGS

01:45:06.801 --> 01:45:09.069 region:rollup2
ON BECAUSE WHEN I SEE A LOT OF

01:45:08.002 --> 01:45:09.904 region:rollup2
PEOPLE COME IN THESE COMMITTEE

01:45:09.069 --> 01:45:12.306 region:rollup2
HEARINGS YOU THEYWANT AT THINGS

01:45:09.904 --> 01:45:13.641 region:rollup2
ON BUT I NEVER SEE THEM SUGGEST.

01:45:12.306 --> 01:45:15.376 region:rollup2
WHAT WE SHOULD TAKE AWAY AND

01:45:13.641 --> 01:45:17.144 region:rollup2
THAT AGAIN IS THE CHALLENGE WE

01:45:15.376 --> 01:45:19.180 region:rollup2
AS ELECTED OFFICIALS FIND

01:45:17.144 --> 01:45:20.281 region:rollup2
OURSELVES IN WITHOUT I'VE THERE

01:45:19.180 --> 01:45:22.650 region:rollup2
MAY BE SOME COMMENTS FROM THE

01:45:20.281 --> 01:45:22.850 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE? DOCTOR PAN.

01:45:22.650 --> 01:45:25.019 region:rollup2
WELL.

01:45:22.850 --> 01:45:26.353 region:rollup2
HOUSE OR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

01:45:25.019 --> 01:45:27.354 region:rollup2
YOUR PRESENTATION AND.

01:45:26.353 --> 01:45:29.056 region:rollup2
I SAY I.

01:45:27.354 --> 01:45:29.590 region:rollup2
STRONGLY AGREE WITH MY GOOD

01:45:29.056 --> 01:45:32.092 region:rollup2
FRIEND.

01:45:29.590 --> 01:45:33.961 region:rollup2
.

01:45:32.092 --> 01:45:34.929 region:rollup2
AND SUMMER WITHOUT CHAIR DONALD

01:45:33.961 --> 01:45:36.297 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I RAN.

01:45:34.929 --> 01:45:37.731 region:rollup2
RESIDENCY TRAINING PROGRAM IN

01:45:36.297 --> 01:45:40.267 region:rollup2
PEDIATRICS AND.

01:45:37.731 --> 01:45:42.403 region:rollup2
COURSE EVERYONE HAD OPINION

01:45:40.267 --> 01:45:44.438 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT ELSE DOCTORS ARE

01:45:42.403 --> 01:45:45.573 region:rollup2
PEDIATRICIANS NEED TO LEARN OR

01:45:44.438 --> 01:45:46.974 region:rollup2
SHOULD DO OUR SELF WORTH AND

01:45:45.573 --> 01:45:49.176 region:rollup2
ALSO WE NEED TO HAVE A SPECIAL

01:45:46.974 --> 01:45:50.878 region:rollup2
COURSE OR LECTURE WITH THAT

01:45:49.176 --> 01:45:52.713 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR TITLE ON IT.

01:45:50.878 --> 01:45:53.781 region:rollup2
AND.

01:45:52.713 --> 01:45:55.115 region:rollup2
BUT THE DAY IS GETTING LONGER

01:45:53.781 --> 01:45:56.417 region:rollup2
AND ACTUALLY WE HAVE PEOPLE

01:45:55.115 --> 01:45:58.252 region:rollup2
WORKING YOU KNOW EIGHTY HOUR

01:45:56.417 --> 01:46:00.554 region:rollup2
WEEKS CELL AND WE SPOKE AT GET

01:45:58.252 --> 01:46:02.156 region:rollup2
THAT. SO I THINK ONE OF THINGS

01:46:00.554 --> 01:46:02.756 region:rollup2
THAT AND APPRECIATE YOUR THIS IS

01:46:02.156 --> 01:46:04.758 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT I THINK WHETHER

01:46:02.756 --> 01:46:06.961 region:rollup2
THINGS TO LOOK BACK STEP BACK

01:46:04.758 --> 01:46:08.229 region:rollup2
AND SAY OKAY WELL. WHERE DOES

01:46:06.961 --> 01:46:10.030 region:rollup2
THIS?

01:46:08.229 --> 01:46:11.966 region:rollup2
DID A DIFFERENT CONCEPTS FIT IN

01:46:10.030 --> 01:46:12.132 region:rollup2
INTO THE CURRICULUM AND HOW DO

01:46:11.966 --> 01:46:13.901 region:rollup2
YOU.

01:46:12.132 --> 01:46:14.668 region:rollup2
.

01:46:13.901 --> 01:46:16.870 region:rollup2
AND HOW HOW HOW DOES IT.

01:46:14.668 --> 01:46:17.872 region:rollup2
.

01:46:16.870 --> 01:46:18.806 region:rollup2
HOW YOU SERVE TEACH MORMON THING

01:46:17.872 --> 01:46:20.841 region:rollup2
AT ONE TIME?

01:46:18.806 --> 01:46:22.843 region:rollup2
SO AT AND AND HOW DO YOU PUT

01:46:20.841 --> 01:46:24.478 region:rollup2
ALL THE BUILDING BLOCKS TOGETHER

01:46:22.843 --> 01:46:27.081 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO FOR EXAMPLE I YOU

01:46:24.478 --> 01:46:28.115 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE AND I CHEMISTRY YOU

01:46:27.081 --> 01:46:29.516 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE LEARNING ABOUT THE

01:46:28.115 --> 01:46:33.087 region:rollup2
FACT THAT INCREASED CARBON

01:46:29.516 --> 01:46:33.721 region:rollup2
DIOXIDE. CAUSES MORE WARMING Y.

01:46:33.087 --> 01:46:35.456 region:rollup2
RIGHT THAT'S A CHEMISTRY COURSE

01:46:33.721 --> 01:46:36.991 region:rollup2
RIGHT IT'S NOT.

01:46:35.456 --> 01:46:38.492 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT IDEOLOGICAL IT'S NOT

01:46:36.991 --> 01:46:39.760 region:rollup2
POLITICAL IT'S JUST SIMPLY.

01:46:38.492 --> 01:46:41.428 region:rollup2
THERE'S THERE'S YOU CAN COME UP

01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:42.863 region:rollup2
WITH THAT THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF

01:46:41.428 --> 01:46:44.164 region:rollup2
SCIENCE THAT SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE

01:46:42.863 --> 01:46:46.300 region:rollup2
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE

01:46:44.164 --> 01:46:47.901 region:rollup2
POLITICS THAT SAYS YOU HAVE MORE

01:46:46.300 --> 01:46:49.169 region:rollup2
CARBON DIOXIDE IN THE AIR YOU

01:46:47.901 --> 01:46:51.071 region:rollup2
HAVE MUCH MORE METHANE YOU GONNA

01:46:49.169 --> 01:46:52.406 region:rollup2
HOLD MORE HEAT.

01:46:51.071 --> 01:46:53.407 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT THAT SIR.

01:46:52.406 --> 01:46:54.909 region:rollup2
YOU.

01:46:53.407 --> 01:46:55.743 region:rollup2
YOU WHY LOOK YOU KNOW WE TALK

01:46:54.909 --> 01:46:58.078 region:rollup2
ABOUT EARTH SCIENCES RIGHT

01:46:55.743 --> 01:46:58.679 region:rollup2
EXACTLY HOW THINGS HOW THAT

01:46:58.078 --> 01:47:00.848 region:rollup2
MEETS YOUR CYCLES OR AND AND

01:46:58.679 --> 01:47:03.017 region:rollup2
THINK. AND AND HOW DO YOU TAKE

01:47:00.848 --> 01:47:04.084 region:rollup2
THOSE BUILDING BLOCKS.

01:47:03.017 --> 01:47:04.652 region:rollup2
AND ONE THINGS TO LOOK BACK TO

01:47:04.084 --> 01:47:05.986 region:rollup2
THE CREW COMES THE METER A

01:47:04.652 --> 01:47:07.054 region:rollup2
TEACHING THAT BUT IT'S NOT LABEL

01:47:05.986 --> 01:47:08.522 region:rollup2
THOSE ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE

01:47:07.054 --> 01:47:10.391 region:rollup2
RIGHT HOW DO YOU TAKE THOSE

01:47:08.522 --> 01:47:12.159 region:rollup2
BUILDING BLOCKS AND THEN MAYBE.

01:47:10.391 --> 01:47:13.827 region:rollup2
BAY THE MISSING PART IS THE END

01:47:12.159 --> 01:47:15.562 region:rollup2
FOR YOU PAUL THIS PIECE TOGETHER

01:47:13.827 --> 01:47:16.597 region:rollup2
YA YOU LEARNED THIS AND

01:47:15.562 --> 01:47:17.331 region:rollup2
CHEMISTRY LEARNED THAT NERD

01:47:16.597 --> 01:47:19.400 region:rollup2
SCIENCE OF LEARNED THIS IN

01:47:17.331 --> 01:47:21.101 region:rollup2
HISTORY. RIGHT AND HOW THOSE AT

01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:22.670 region:rollup2
ALL THEN COME TOGETHER. EGGS I

01:47:21.101 --> 01:47:24.471 region:rollup2
WOULD SAY THAT THE ONE THING

01:47:22.670 --> 01:47:25.439 region:rollup2
THAT WE PERHAPS.

01:47:24.471 --> 01:47:26.840 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN WHAT THE WHAT WILL IT

01:47:25.439 --> 01:47:28.809 region:rollup2
TAKE AWAY THAT THAT PERHAPS WE

01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:29.944 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T DONE AS GOOD A GOOD A

01:47:28.809 --> 01:47:33.314 region:rollup2
JOB. IS.

01:47:29.944 --> 01:47:34.982 region:rollup2
SORT OF THE SYNTHESIS AND THEN

01:47:33.314 --> 01:47:35.983 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE THEN TAKE ACTION AND

01:47:34.982 --> 01:47:37.318 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY I APPRECIATE YOU'RE

01:47:35.983 --> 01:47:38.385 region:rollup2
HERE BECAUSE YOU'RE LYING ABOUT

01:47:37.318 --> 01:47:39.286 region:rollup2
CIVIC ENGAGEMENT.

01:47:38.385 --> 01:47:41.121 region:rollup2
I HOW BECAUSE.

01:47:39.286 --> 01:47:42.323 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT JUST IT'S GREAT TO

01:47:41.121 --> 01:47:43.924 region:rollup2
LEARN ABOUT IT BUT THEN THE

01:47:42.323 --> 01:47:45.426 region:rollup2
THING IS IS THAT YOU KNOW HOW

01:47:43.924 --> 01:47:47.127 region:rollup2
WATER WAYS FOR YOU TO THEN ACT

01:47:45.426 --> 01:47:47.995 region:rollup2
ON THIS INFORMATION.

01:47:47.127 --> 01:47:49.263 region:rollup2
RIGHT YOU HAVE THIS INFORMATION

01:47:47.995 --> 01:47:50.931 region:rollup2
NOW HOW HOW WE ACT ON IT HOW DO

01:47:49.263 --> 01:47:52.333 region:rollup2
WE.

01:47:50.931 --> 01:47:55.336 region:rollup2
CREATE CHANGE HOW WE ADDRESS

01:47:52.333 --> 01:47:57.671 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THAT AND HOW DO.

01:47:55.336 --> 01:48:00.074 region:rollup2
YOU DO A STUDENTS AND THEN FEW

01:47:57.671 --> 01:48:02.242 region:rollup2
AND AND AND IN THE FUTURE AS I

01:48:00.074 --> 01:48:04.011 region:rollup2
IS AS. IT IS OF PEOPLE WHEN YOU

01:48:02.242 --> 01:48:05.746 region:rollup2
CAN VOTE AND SO FORTH WHAT CAN

01:48:04.011 --> 01:48:06.513 region:rollup2
YOU DO AND RUN FOR OFFICE BY THE

01:48:05.746 --> 01:48:08.282 region:rollup2
WAY NEXUS VOTE.

01:48:06.513 --> 01:48:10.250 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHAT CAN YOU DO TO

01:48:08.282 --> 01:48:11.118 region:rollup2
HELP SHAPE THAT DIALOGUE THAT'S

01:48:10.250 --> 01:48:12.953 region:rollup2
HAPPENING.

01:48:11.118 --> 01:48:15.389 region:rollup2
NEXT YOU CAN DO THAT NOW EVEN

01:48:12.953 --> 01:48:16.023 region:rollup2
GO AROUND THE DINNER TABLE HOW

01:48:15.389 --> 01:48:16.924 region:rollup2
DO YOU SHAPE THE DIALOGUE AROUND

01:48:16.023 --> 01:48:18.325 region:rollup2
IT.

01:48:16.924 --> 01:48:18.993 region:rollup2
WE CAN CERTAINLY HAVE DIFFERENT

01:48:18.325 --> 01:48:21.662 region:rollup2
PRIORITIES.

01:48:18.993 --> 01:48:23.230 region:rollup2
.

01:48:21.662 --> 01:48:24.665 region:rollup2
BUT HOPEFULLY WE ALSO HAVE THE

01:48:23.230 --> 01:48:27.101 region:rollup2
EDUCATION TO DISCERN WHAT THE

01:48:24.665 --> 01:48:29.436 region:rollup2
FACTS ARE. AND THAT THOSE FACTS

01:48:27.101 --> 01:48:31.105 region:rollup2
INFORMED THE KIND OF POLICIES

01:48:29.436 --> 01:48:32.573 region:rollup2
AND PRIORITIES WHO WANT AND

01:48:31.105 --> 01:48:33.874 region:rollup2
WHILE CERTAINLY THIS MAY BE THE

01:48:32.573 --> 01:48:36.510 region:rollup2
BUILDING IT SEEMS LIKE IT ALL

01:48:33.874 --> 01:48:38.412 region:rollup2
HAPPENS. FRANKLY IT STARTS WITH

01:48:36.510 --> 01:48:40.247 region:rollup2
THAT ONE'S DINNER TABLE.

01:48:38.412 --> 01:48:41.582 region:rollup2
AND EVENTUALLY IT TRICKLES AND

01:48:40.247 --> 01:48:44.284 region:rollup2
THIS IS WHERE IT SORT OF KINDA

01:48:41.582 --> 01:48:46.253 region:rollup2
COMES TOGETHER IN THE END BUT.

01:48:44.284 --> 01:48:48.555 region:rollup2
AND SO EACH OF YOU COMPLAIN

01:48:46.253 --> 01:48:50.657 region:rollup2
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ROLE BUT WE

01:48:48.555 --> 01:48:52.893 region:rollup2
ALSO NEED TO BE SURE THAT.

01:48:50.657 --> 01:48:54.194 region:rollup2
YOU AND YOUR YOUR HERE BUT YOUR

01:48:52.893 --> 01:48:55.229 region:rollup2
CLASSMATES ALSO NOW AND HOW WE

01:48:54.194 --> 01:48:56.397 region:rollup2
SYNTHESIZE ALL THOSE DIFFERENT

CHALLENGES WITH ENVIRONMENTAL

01:49:00.267 --> 01:49:03.003 region:rollup2
SCIENTISTS A MULTI DISCIPLINARY.

AND THAT YOU KNOW I THINK THAT

01:49:31.865 --> 01:49:35.869 region:rollup2
YOU'VE IDENTIFIED A LOT OF.

01:49:33.667 --> 01:49:36.370 region:rollup2
REALLY IMPORTANT I ISSUES THAT

01:49:35.869 --> 01:49:38.105 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO GRAPPLE WITH.

01:49:36.370 --> 01:49:40.674 region:rollup2

ISSUES OF PUBLIC POLICY AND I

01:49:45.579 --> 01:49:47.848 region:rollup2

KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO GET INTO.

01:49:54.054 --> 01:49:57.458 region:rollup2
THE TRAP ALSO THINKING THAT THE

01:49:55.856 --> 01:49:59.226 region:rollup2
ONLY WAY TO BRING ABOUT THAT

01:49:57.458 --> 01:50:00.294 region:rollup2
CHANGE IS THROUGH THE

01:49:59.226 --> 01:50:01.929 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE OR THROUGH

01:50:17.511 --> 01:50:19.646 region:rollup2
.

01:50:19.012 --> 01:50:20.481 region:rollup2
AS AN EXAMPLE I HAVE A STUDENT

01:50:19.646 --> 01:50:21.348 region:rollup2
AT ONE OF THE SCHOOLS IN MY

01:50:20.481 --> 01:50:22.516 region:rollup2
DISTRICT TO.

01:50:21.348 --> 01:50:24.384 region:rollup2
WANTED TEACHERS TO RECEIVE SOME

01:50:22.516 --> 01:50:25.519 region:rollup2
TRAINING ON RECOGNIZING SIGNS

01:50:24.384 --> 01:50:26.854 region:rollup2
THAT A STUDENT MIGHT BE

01:50:25.519 --> 01:50:27.688 region:rollup2
SUFFERING FOR MENTAL ILLNESS AND

01:50:26.854 --> 01:50:28.655 region:rollup2
SO THEY THOUGHT WELL THIS IS

01:50:27.688 --> 01:50:30.457 region:rollup2
GOING TO COST SOME MONEY SO HE

01:50:28.655 --> 01:50:32.359 region:rollup2
PUT ON A CONCERT. AT THE SCHOOL

01:50:30.457 --> 01:50:33.794 region:rollup2
ALL TO RAISE MONEY AND THAT THEY

01:50:32.359 --> 01:50:34.595 region:rollup2
THEN ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED AND

01:50:33.794 --> 01:50:35.229 region:rollup2
GOT THE TEACHERS THE SORT OF

01:50:34.595 --> 01:50:37.798 region:rollup2
TRAINING.

01:50:35.229 --> 01:50:39.800 region:rollup2
SO I YOU KNOW I.

01:50:37.798 --> 01:50:41.135 region:rollup2

01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:43.103 region:rollup2
TIME THAT EVERYONE I HEARD FROM

I'M SURE WILL REMAIN INVOLVED IN

01:50:43.103 --> 01:50:45.606 region:rollup2

FANTASY PROPOSAL FIRST OF ALL.

01:51:03.257 --> 01:51:06.627 region:rollup2
.

01:51:04.758 --> 01:51:07.961 region:rollup2
THE YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY WHAT

01:51:06.627 --> 01:51:09.763 region:rollup2
THEY'RE ASKING FOR IS THE

01:51:07.961 --> 01:51:11.498 region:rollup2
CREATION OF A MODEL CURRICULUM

01:51:09.763 --> 01:51:12.232 region:rollup2

AND AND SHOULD BE DOING?

01:51:33.820 --> 01:51:37.524 region:rollup2
AT THE SAME TIME BY NOT
