TERMS OF THE NEED FOR THE STAFF

00:28:10.822 --> 00:28:12.390

I'M A FORMER --

00:28:22.033 --> 00:28:23.835
CLASSROOM TEACHER IN GRADES FOUR

00:28:23.902 --> 00:28:24.769
EIGHT AND NINE TWELVE OF BEEN

00:28:24.836 --> 00:28:25.970
THE MADERA COUNTY TEACHER OF THE

00:28:26.037 --> 00:28:27.305
YEAR IN THE PAST.

00:28:27.372 --> 00:28:29.007
I'VE BEEN FORTUNATE TO START A

00:28:29.074 --> 00:28:30.008
ONE TO ONE HIGH SCHOOL WHERE ALL

00:28:30.075 --> 00:28:31.709
THE KIDS GOT A MACBOOK AND THERE

00:28:31.776 --> 00:28:33.445
WERE A GOOGLE DOCS AND HIDE IT

00:28:33.511 --> 00:28:35.413
IN A PROJECT BASED LEARNING

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.381
ENVIRONMENT FROM DAY.

00:28:36.448 --> 00:28:37.282
ONE AND TO JUST PUT IT

00:28:37.348 --> 00:28:39.084
SUCCINCTLY A THE BEST

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:40.652
EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH SAYS THAT

00:28:40.718 --> 00:28:42.420
TEACHERS DON'T GET BETTER.

00:28:42.487 --> 00:28:43.822
UNLESS THEY HAVE FORTY HOURS OF

00:28:43.888 --> 00:28:44.956
SUSTAINED PROFESSIONAL

00:28:45.023 --> 00:28:46.724
DEVELOPMENT PER YEAR.

00:28:46.791 --> 00:28:48.493
AND THE FISCAL REALITY IS THAT

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:49.327
MOST DISTRICTS IF YOU CALL ANY

00:28:49.394 --> 00:28:51.262
OF YOUR LOCAL DISTRICTS THEY

00:28:51.329 --> 00:28:52.363
USUALLY PROVIDE ONE TO THREE

00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:54.099
DAYS OF TRAINING.

00:28:54.165 --> 00:28:55.567
PER TEACHER FOR YEAR AND THAT

00:28:55.633 --> 00:28:57.168
AMOUNTS TO ABOUT EIGHTEEN HOURS

00:28:57.235 --> 00:29:00.171
SO MOST DISTRICTS ARE ABOUT 50%

00:29:00.238 --> 00:29:01.306
OF WHAT'S NEEDED TO TRULY

00:29:01.372 --> 00:29:03.975

THAT'S GONNA CLASSROOMS IS THAT

00:29:07.011 --> 00:29:08.880
EVERYTHING IS IN FLUX.

00:29:08.947 --> 00:29:10.515

00:29:12.317 --> 00:29:13.651
DISCIPLINE SYSTEM WORKS A

00:29:13.718 --> 00:29:14.319

00:29:14.385 --> 00:29:15.787
CURRICULUM IS DIFFERENT ADDING

00:29:15.854 --> 00:29:18.189
DEVICES DIFFERENT TESTING IS

00:29:18.256 --> 00:29:20.325

WHEN THIS TRANSITION --

00:29:30.435 --> 00:29:31.936

CITIZENS OF THE FUTURE.

00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:36.908
IF WE DON'T PREPARE THEM WHILE.

00:29:36.975 --> 00:29:37.542
WE WILL NOT HAVE THE WORK FORCE

00:29:37.609 --> 00:29:39.744
