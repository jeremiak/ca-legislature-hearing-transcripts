HIGH LEVEL OF VOLATILITY THIS

01:13:30.072 --> 01:13:30.806
IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE

REVENUES. ON TOP OF THIS

01:13:52.427 --> 01:13:53.929
NATURAL VOLATILITY THERE'S ALSO

01:13:53.996 --> 01:13:55.097
MUCH UNCERTAINTY AROUND

OF REVENUE FORECAST IS MORE

01:14:37.072 --> 01:14:38.240

01:22:00.081 --> 01:22:03.184
FIFTY CHANCE OF- MATERIALIZING-

01:22:03.251 --> 01:22:04.486
AND SO THEY ARE BASED ON THE

01:22:04.552 --> 01:22:06.021
HISTORICAL GROWTH RATES AFTER

01:22:06.087 --> 01:22:07.922
REVENUES IN THE STATE ACTUALLY

01:22:07.989 --> 01:22:09.924
A LITTLE BIT LOWER- ACCOUNTING

01:22:09.991 --> 01:22:10.992
FOR SOME POLICIES THAT WILL

01:22:11.059 --> 01:22:12.794
TURN OFF SO WE ASSUME REVENUES

01:22:12.861 --> 01:22:13.528
WERE GROWING ABOUT FOUR

01:22:13.595 --> 01:22:16.464
PERCENT- IN THE- OUT YEARS-

01:22:16.531 --> 01:22:19.301
WHICH- WHICH CAN SUPPORT-

01:22:19.367 --> 01:22:21.803
HIGHER. SPENDING THEN UNDER THE

01:22:21.870 --> 01:22:24.105
GOVERNOR'S ESTIMATES- AND AGAIN

01:22:24.172 --> 01:22:25.774
AS WE'VE STATED HISTORICALLY

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:26.841
THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CHOOSE

01:22:26.908 --> 01:22:28.810
ITS REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES

01:22:28.877 --> 01:22:30.378
BASED ON ITS- ON ITS RISK

01:22:30.445 --> 01:22:32.681
TOLERANCE AND WANTING TO SPEAK

01:22:32.747 --> 01:22:36.451
IS WILL HAPPEN IN FUTURE YEARS.

01:22:36.518 --> 01:22:38.119
OKAY LET OF THEM ASK YOU A

01:22:38.186 --> 01:22:39.154
SPECIFICALLY AND IN TERMS THE-

01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:41.256
TO YOUR PREVIOUS ANALYSIS SO

01:22:41.323 --> 01:22:45.193
THE- THE CERTAINLY THE THAT. MR

01:22:45.260 --> 01:22:48.029
PECK MADE SAM HEADLINES- IN

01:22:48.096 --> 01:22:50.732
TERMS OF. BEING L. SOMEWHAT

01:22:50.799 --> 01:22:52.300
CRITICAL OF THE GOVERNOR'S

01:22:52.367 --> 01:22:55.937
VISION. OF USING- BUDGET TOOLS-

01:22:56.004 --> 01:22:57.138
RESERVE WITHDRAWALS AND

01:22:57.205 --> 01:22:59.874
BORROWING- BUT THEN ALSO- WITH

01:22:59.941 --> 01:23:01.609
THE GOVERNOR WAS ALSO USING

01:23:01.676 --> 01:23:04.713
THAT TO CONTINUE SPENDING THAT-

01:23:04.779 --> 01:23:06.181
THIS FRAMEWORK MY UNDERSTANDING

01:23:06.247 --> 01:23:08.950
DOESN'T UNDO THAT SO THAT WAS

01:23:09.017 --> 01:23:09.884
THAT WOULD THAT CONCERNS STILL

01:23:09.951 --> 01:23:12.020
REMAIN. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER

01:23:12.087 --> 01:23:14.289
IT'S THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL OR

01:23:14.356 --> 01:23:16.658
IN THIS FRAMEWORK. THIS PACKAGE

01:23:16.725 --> 01:23:17.892
TAKES SOME SOME DIFFERENT

01:23:17.959 --> 01:23:21.162
ACTIONS IN ORDER TO- AT BUILD

01:23:21.229 --> 01:23:22.330
SOME ADDITIONAL BUDGET

01:23:22.397 --> 01:23:25.066
RESILIENCY SO IT- UNDERLIES THE

01:23:25.133 --> 01:23:27.535
REMAINING DEFERRALS- TO SCHOOLS

01:23:27.602 --> 01:23:28.870
WHICH IS ABOUT TWO POINT SIX

01:23:28.937 --> 01:23:30.105
BILLION I BELIEVE IT ALSO

01:23:30.171 --> 01:23:31.740
PREPARES ABOUT ONE BILLION

01:23:31.806 --> 01:23:33.308
DOLLARS WORTH OF BOND DEBT. AND

01:23:33.375 --> 01:23:36.845
MAKES AN ADDITIONAL- SAFETY NET

01:23:36.911 --> 01:23:38.913
RESERVE DEPOSIT- I BELIEVE

01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:39.748
AROUND AROUND A BILLION

01:23:39.814 --> 01:23:41.850
DOLLARS- SO IT TAKES DIFFERENT

01:23:41.916 --> 01:23:43.351
ACTIONS TO PROVIDE MORE BUDGET

01:23:43.418 --> 01:23:45.320
RESILIENCY- AND THE LEGISLATURE

01:23:45.387 --> 01:23:46.521
FACES CHOICES ABOUT HOW IT

01:23:46.588 --> 01:23:48.890
WANTS TO PREPARE FOR A FUTURE

01:23:48.957 --> 01:23:52.193
RECESSION. OKAY IN TERMS OF-

01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:54.129
AND I AGREE I THINK THAT THE-

01:23:54.195 --> 01:23:56.331
THE PROPOSAL TO PAY DOWN- THE

01:23:56.398 --> 01:23:59.234
DEFERRALS IS- IS A COURSE THAT-

01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:00.368
WE AS THE LEGISLATURE WE SHOULD

01:24:00.435 --> 01:24:02.704
DO HI SO I CERTAINLY OF- I

01:24:02.771 --> 01:24:07.041
THINK THAT THAT'S- A STEP IN

01:24:07.108 --> 01:24:07.675
THE RIGHT DIRECTION- IN TERMS.

01:24:07.742 --> 01:24:13.214
OF. THE MAYBE I CAN MAYBE THIS

01:24:13.281 --> 01:24:16.117
QUESTION IS BETTER DRESSED- TO

01:24:16.184 --> 01:24:18.186
THE POVERTY FINANCED BUT- WHAT

01:24:18.253 --> 01:24:20.355
IS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL OR

01:24:20.422 --> 01:24:23.758
THE JUSTIFICATION OF NOT- OF

01:24:23.825 --> 01:24:25.960
NOT REVERSING THE- TO TAX

01:24:26.027 --> 01:24:27.295
INCREASES FROM FROM LAST YEAR'S

01:24:27.362 --> 01:24:31.032
BUDGET- WE SIR I THINK THE

01:24:31.099 --> 01:24:32.066
FRAMEWORK AND IN THIS BUDGET

01:24:32.133 --> 01:24:34.969
DOESN'T- THE TAXI HOUSES AS

01:24:35.036 --> 01:24:38.273
WELL SO. MAYBE YOU CAN MAYBE I

01:24:38.339 --> 01:24:39.007
CAN JUST UNDERSTAND THE

01:24:39.073 --> 01:24:40.708
PERSPECTIVE OF WE WERE AN

01:24:40.775 --> 01:24:42.911
EMERGENCY SITUATION LAST YEAR

01:24:42.977 --> 01:24:44.045
THE PROJECTIONS WERE WHAT THEY

01:24:44.112 --> 01:24:45.947
WERE AND THEY WERE ENDED UP.

01:24:46.014 --> 01:24:48.383
BEING TOO LOW BUT NOW THAT

01:24:48.450 --> 01:24:50.318
WE'RE KIND OF IN THIS NEW

01:24:50.385 --> 01:24:54.489
ENVIRONMENT WHY WOULD WE NOT-

01:24:54.556 --> 01:24:55.790
UNDER THE TAX INCREASES IN LAST

01:24:55.857 --> 01:25:00.061
YEAR'S BUDGET. AND I'M GONNA

01:25:00.128 --> 01:25:01.729
TURN THIS ONE OVER TO MY

01:25:01.796 --> 01:25:05.066
COLLEAGUE RYAN MILLER. THANK

01:25:05.133 --> 01:25:06.468
YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER RYAN MILLER

01:25:06.534 --> 01:25:08.136
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WOULD YOU

01:25:08.203 --> 01:25:10.638
MIND PERHAPS CLARIFYING WHICH

01:25:10.705 --> 01:25:12.574
TAX INCREASES ARE ARE YOU

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:15.143
REFERRING TO- I BELIEVE THAT-

01:25:15.210 --> 01:25:17.512
THE LEGISLATURE TAKE ACTION ON

01:25:17.579 --> 01:25:19.013
THAT OPERATING LOSSES ON

01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:20.748
REMOVALS OF TAX CREDITS AND

01:25:20.815 --> 01:25:21.683
CLEAN THE RESEARCH AND

01:25:21.749 --> 01:25:23.751
DEVELOPMENT- SO. THAT I THINK

01:25:23.818 --> 01:25:25.253
WAS A NINETY NINE POINT ONE

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:27.388
BILLION DOLLARS IN. HAND TAX

01:25:27.455 --> 01:25:29.257
INCREASES IN THE PREVIOUS

01:25:29.324 --> 01:25:31.192
BUDGET I WAS DONE NOW THAT

01:25:31.259 --> 01:25:34.128
WE'RE IN THIS NEW ENVIRONMENT

01:25:34.195 --> 01:25:36.364
WHY WOULD WE NOT AND DO THOSE.

01:25:36.431 --> 01:25:37.098
THANK YOU FOR THE

01:25:37.165 --> 01:25:40.602
CLARIFICATION- SO AS YOU NOTED-

01:25:40.668 --> 01:25:42.737
LAST YEAR'S BUDGET DID. AND

01:25:42.804 --> 01:25:45.607
CERTAIN TAX CREDITS AVAILABLE-

01:25:45.673 --> 01:25:46.941
GENERALLY TO LARGER

01:25:47.008 --> 01:25:48.910
CORPORATIONS I THINK I THINK IN

01:25:48.977 --> 01:25:52.247
THE ADMINISTRATION'S JUDGMENT-

01:25:52.313 --> 01:25:55.049
THOSE ACTIONS- AFFECTED-

01:25:55.116 --> 01:25:57.852
ENTITIES THAT- TENDED TO BE AS

01:25:57.919 --> 01:25:58.987
I SAID KIND OF LARGER

01:25:59.053 --> 01:26:03.291
CORPORATIONS INTENDED TO- ALSO-

01:26:03.358 --> 01:26:05.293
IN MANY CASES BE ENTITIES THAT

01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:06.494
WERE SORT OF WEATHERING THE

01:26:06.561 --> 01:26:08.897
PANDEMIC RELATIVELY WELL AND IN

01:26:08.963 --> 01:26:11.299
OUR- JUDGMENT IN THE GOVERNOR'S

01:26:11.366 --> 01:26:13.401
BUDGET NAY REVISION- WE

01:26:13.468 --> 01:26:16.070
ATTEMPTED TO FOCUS MORE ON. A

01:26:16.137 --> 01:26:19.908
SMALL BUSINESSES- CERTAIN- YOU

01:26:19.974 --> 01:26:21.142
KNOW BUSINESS ENTITIES THAT MAY

01:26:21.209 --> 01:26:22.610
BE STRUGGLING TO A GREATER

01:26:22.677 --> 01:26:26.047
EXTENT IN THE PANDEMIC- SO I

01:26:26.114 --> 01:26:27.515
THINK THAT'S ESSENTIALLY AND

01:26:27.582 --> 01:26:28.917
NOT SHELL AND THAT AND THAT'S

01:26:28.983 --> 01:26:31.386
WHY WE PRIORITIZE THINGS LIKE-

01:26:31.452 --> 01:26:32.921
YOU KNOW THE CALIFORNIA

01:26:32.987 --> 01:26:34.989
COMPETES PROPOSAL- THE FILM

01:26:35.056 --> 01:26:37.592
CREDIT EXPANSION AND- AND OTHER

01:26:37.659 --> 01:26:39.127
SIMILAR PROPOSALS OVER

01:26:39.193 --> 01:26:43.231
RESTORING THE- THE ACTIONS THAT

01:26:43.298 --> 01:26:46.734
YOU MENTIONED. SO WAS THAT A

01:26:46.801 --> 01:26:48.469
JUSTIFICATION OF THAT YOU'D

01:26:48.536 --> 01:26:50.638
THAT THOSE TAX INCREASES OR

01:26:50.705 --> 01:26:53.041
DOES HE USE A POSTPONEMENTS

01:26:53.107 --> 01:26:55.243
THEY'RE NEVER GOING AWAY- OR IT

01:26:55.310 --> 01:26:57.412
WITH. THE GOVERNOR. AGREE THAT

01:26:57.478 --> 01:26:59.180
AT SOME POINT THEY NEED TO GO

01:26:59.247 --> 01:26:59.747
AWAY FOR THE THEY NEED TO BE

01:26:59.814 --> 01:27:03.851
REVERSED. I BELIEVE THEY WERE

01:27:03.918 --> 01:27:06.020
TEMPORARY SUSPENSIONS I DON'T

01:27:06.087 --> 01:27:08.056
KNOW IF- CAROLINE ARE YOU FROM

01:27:08.122 --> 01:27:10.525
THE ELLIA COULD SPEAK TO THAT-

01:27:10.592 --> 01:27:15.396
BUT BUT- YES THIS IS CAROLYN

01:27:15.463 --> 01:27:16.731
SURE AGAIN THEY ARE TEMPORARY

01:27:16.798 --> 01:27:18.800
TAX INCREASES UNABLE TO TURN

01:27:18.866 --> 01:27:21.169
THEY WERE FOR THREE YEARS- SO I

01:27:21.235 --> 01:27:22.303
BELIEVE THAT MEANS IN TURN OFF

01:27:22.370 --> 01:27:25.206
AND- TWENTY. THREE TWENTY PARK.

01:27:25.273 --> 01:27:27.775
OKAY BUT BUT THOSE THAT THREE

01:27:27.842 --> 01:27:29.544
YEAR TIME FRAME WAS OF COURSE

01:27:29.611 --> 01:27:31.512
THE UNCERTAINTY OF LAST YEAR.

01:27:31.579 --> 01:27:33.147
SO NOW WE HAVE THE REVENUE

01:27:33.214 --> 01:27:35.583
PROJECTIONS THIS YEAR HICH IS

01:27:35.650 --> 01:27:37.585
SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER SO IS

01:27:37.652 --> 01:27:40.888
THERE OF. HIS AT SOME POINT

01:27:40.955 --> 01:27:41.389
WHAT WHEN WOULD THAT BE

01:27:41.456 --> 01:27:47.095
REASSESSED. BY THE LEVI YEAH I

01:27:47.161 --> 01:27:50.098
FIGURED OUT THAT IF YOU LEAVE

01:27:50.164 --> 01:27:50.698
THE TAX INCREASES TO FOR THEIR

01:27:50.765 --> 01:27:52.500
FOR TWO MORE YEARS. I THINK I

01:27:52.567 --> 01:27:54.035
WOULD JUST GO BACK TO MY PRIOR

01:27:54.102 --> 01:27:55.536
COMMENTS ABOUT SORT OF THE

01:27:55.603 --> 01:27:56.738
RELATIVE FOCUS OF THE

01:27:56.804 --> 01:27:58.306
ADMINISTRATION'S TAX PROPOSALS

01:27:58.373 --> 01:28:00.408
AND IN THIS BUDGET MAYOR

01:28:00.475 --> 01:28:03.745
VISION. OKAY THEN THAT ACTUALLY

01:28:03.811 --> 01:28:04.879
TO ME TO THE NEXT QUESTION I

01:28:04.946 --> 01:28:06.814
THINK YOU TEED IT UP VERY WELL

01:28:06.881 --> 01:28:07.949
SO THE FOCUS ON SMALL

01:28:08.016 --> 01:28:09.951
BUSINESSES. SO THE GOVERNOR

01:28:10.018 --> 01:28:13.254
PROPOSES- BUT PROPOSED ABOUT

01:28:13.321 --> 01:28:14.522
ONE POINT ONE BILLION TO

01:28:14.589 --> 01:28:16.190
ADDRESS THE STATE'S TWENTY FOUR

01:28:16.257 --> 01:28:17.091
BILLION DOLLAR UNEMPLOYMENT

01:28:17.158 --> 01:28:19.060
INSURANCE FUND DEBT. AT THIS

01:28:19.127 --> 01:28:20.995
FRAMEWORK I THINK TAKES A

01:28:21.062 --> 01:28:22.330
DIFFERENT APPROACH AND-

01:28:22.397 --> 01:28:24.298
PROVIDES TRY TO PROVIDE THEM

01:28:24.365 --> 01:28:26.167
ASSEMBLY- ASSISTANCE TO SMALL

01:28:26.234 --> 01:28:28.336
BUSINESSES. AND IN A DIFFERENT

01:28:28.403 --> 01:28:31.072
WAY- BUT- AS WE'VE SEEN FROM

01:28:31.139 --> 01:28:33.975
PREVIOUS SITUATIONS WHERE BOND

01:28:34.042 --> 01:28:37.745
DEBT OR THAT YOU HAD YOU I FIND

01:28:37.812 --> 01:28:39.514
THAT- OCCURRED TO AND IT I

01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:41.382
THINK IT TOOK TEN YEARS TO PAY

01:28:41.449 --> 01:28:43.017
OFF THE DEBT FROM THE GREAT

01:28:43.084 --> 01:28:46.521
RECESSION BEFORE- AND- THAT

01:28:46.587 --> 01:28:48.423
LEAD THAT THE DEBT RIGHT NOW

01:28:48.489 --> 01:28:49.824
WILL LEAD TO A SIGNIFICANT

01:28:49.891 --> 01:28:51.392
INCREASE IN BUSINESSES. PAYROLL

01:28:51.459 --> 01:28:53.528
TAXES- SMALL BUSINESSES AS YOU

01:28:53.594 --> 01:28:55.763
MENTIONED. SO WHAT WOULD THE

01:28:55.830 --> 01:28:57.532
GOVERNOR SAY IN TERMS OF SICK

01:28:57.598 --> 01:29:00.234
PUTTING MORE MONEY. OR TAKING

01:29:00.301 --> 01:29:01.102
CARE OF THE TWENTY FOUR BILLION

01:29:01.169 --> 01:29:02.904
DOLLAR DEBT. THAT CURRENTLY

01:29:02.970 --> 01:29:04.572
EXISTS IN THE UNEMPLOYMENT

01:29:04.639 --> 01:29:11.312
INSURANCE FUND. AND I'M GONNA

01:29:11.379 --> 01:29:11.946
TURN THAT WENT OVER TO MR CHRIS

01:29:12.013 --> 01:29:15.083
COOK. COULD DEPARTMENT OF

01:29:15.149 --> 01:29:18.319
FINANCE- SO NUMBER IT IT MAYBE

01:29:18.386 --> 01:29:19.620
IF YOU CAN HELP ME CLARIFY YOUR

01:29:19.687 --> 01:29:20.588
QUESTION AND FROM WHAT I

01:29:20.655 --> 01:29:22.423
UNDERSTAND- FROM WHAT I

01:29:22.490 --> 01:29:24.225
UNDERSTAND THE LEGISLATIVE

01:29:24.292 --> 01:29:27.695
PACKAGE IS PROPOSING TO PROVIDE

01:29:27.762 --> 01:29:28.629
TO TWO BILLION OVER SEVERAL

01:29:28.696 --> 01:29:32.800
YEARS- FOR- TAX CREDITS FOR

01:29:32.867 --> 01:29:34.669
SMALL BUSINESSES. RIGHT SO I

01:29:34.736 --> 01:29:36.270
LOOK I'VE MICHAEL I HAVE MY

01:29:36.337 --> 01:29:37.705
CONCERNS WITH THIS LEGISLATIVE

01:29:37.772 --> 01:29:39.474
FRAMEWORK AS WELL I THINK THAT

01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:40.608
THIS ARE LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK

01:29:40.675 --> 01:29:42.176
SHOULD OFFICE ALSO TAKE CARE OF

01:29:42.243 --> 01:29:43.411
THE TWENTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS

01:29:43.478 --> 01:29:45.379

DEBT THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS IN

01:30:00.728 --> 01:30:02.797
THE U. I. FUND OR DO YOU

01:30:02.864 --> 01:30:04.098

01:30:04.165 --> 01:30:05.266
THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS PUT

01:30:05.333 --> 01:30:06.534
TOGETHER AND YOU WOULD GO BACK

01:30:06.601 --> 01:30:10.338
TO- WHAT YOU GUYS PROPOSED. WHY

01:30:10.404 --> 01:30:12.306
I THINK THOSE CONVERSATIONS YOU

01:30:12.373 --> 01:30:13.775
KNOW. HAPPY TO HAVE THOSE

01:30:13.841 --> 01:30:14.909

01:30:14.976 --> 01:30:15.977
WEEKS ON YOU KNOW THE

01:30:16.043 --> 01:30:18.246
PRIORITIES. I WILL SAY THAT THE

01:30:18.312 --> 01:30:21.349
ONE BILLION- IN THE- FEDERAL

01:30:21.415 --> 01:30:23.384
DOLLARS OVER SIXTY TWO ARCA.

01:30:23.451 --> 01:30:25.887
WAS BALANCE SEEN THE OTHER

01:30:25.953 --> 01:30:27.722
PRIORITIES THAT THAT THEY ADMIT

01:30:27.789 --> 01:30:28.856
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAD

01:30:28.923 --> 01:30:30.625
WITH THE USE OF THOSE FUNDS.

01:30:30.691 --> 01:30:32.627
AND SO WE FELT THAT ONE BILLION

01:30:32.693 --> 01:30:34.595
ABOUT ONE BILLION DOLLARS WAS

01:30:34.662 --> 01:30:35.730
AN INVESTMENT THAT COULD BE

01:30:35.797 --> 01:30:38.666
MADE OUT TO HELP ALLEVIATE SOME

01:30:38.733 --> 01:30:39.267
OF THE PRESSURE ON THE U. LIKE

01:30:39.333 --> 01:30:41.569
THAT. BUT AGAIN THOSE

01:30:41.636 --> 01:30:42.637

PARTIES LOOK LIKE BY THE WAY.

01:30:47.008 --> 01:30:48.910
OKAY I WOULD JUST ARGUE THAT

01:30:48.976 --> 01:30:50.244
THAT MAY WAITING WE SHOULD WE

01:30:50.311 --> 01:30:51.646
AS THE LEGISLATIVE BODY AND WE

01:30:51.712 --> 01:30:52.947

LOOK AT A MORE SIGNIFICANT

01:30:55.917 --> 01:30:57.118
INVESTMENT AND I THINK THAT THE

01:30:57.185 --> 01:30:58.085
CONVERSATIONS OF THE CHAIR WILL

01:30:58.152 --> 01:31:01.289

01:31:04.225 --> 01:31:06.627
SIGNIFICANT- CHALLENGE THAT

01:31:06.694 --> 01:31:08.462

US- THE LPS- ISSUE IS. IS THIS

01:31:22.243 --> 01:31:23.177
THE BEST THING TO FIGURE OUT

01:31:23.244 --> 01:31:24.245
WHETHER WE'RE GONNA DEAL WITH

01:31:24.312 --> 01:31:26.080
AS WELL I JUST WANNA AND BY

01:31:26.147 --> 01:31:28.716
SAYING THAT- IN TERMS OF-

01:31:28.783 --> 01:31:30.418
PUBLIC SAFETY IS THIS A FIVE-

01:31:30.484 --> 01:31:35.957

FOR THE OFFICE- ANYTHING WE'RE

01:32:18.065 --> 01:32:19.267
STILL WORKING THROUGH THE

01:32:19.333 --> 01:32:21.736
DETAILS OF THAT- THAT

01:32:21.802 --> 01:32:26.140

01:32:42.123 --> 01:32:43.758
THREE POSITIONS FOR THE OFFICE.

01:32:43.824 --> 01:32:46.327
OKAY I DID WANT TO APPLY THE A

01:32:46.394 --> 01:32:47.028
TEN MILLION DOLLARS EMERGENCY

01:32:47.094 --> 01:32:48.129
FUNDING THROUGH THE OFFICE

01:32:48.195 --> 01:32:51.198
EMERGENCY SERVICES- TO SUPPORT-

01:32:51.265 --> 01:32:52.900
THE ACTIVITIES TO PREVENT.

01:32:52.967 --> 01:32:53.601
HUMAN TRAFFICKING I THINK

01:32:53.668 --> 01:32:55.536
THAT'S- NEEDED INVESTMENT.

01:32:55.603 --> 01:32:58.105
ESPECIALLY DURING THE DOWNTURN-

01:32:58.172 --> 01:32:58.639
YOU KNOW NONPROFIT

01:32:58.706 --> 01:33:00.174
ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAPPENS-

01:33:00.241 --> 01:33:01.876
SERVING HIS VICTIMS THEY'VE

01:33:01.943 --> 01:33:04.645
BEEN- AFFECTED AS WELL. AND YOU

01:33:04.712 --> 01:33:05.780
KNOW HUMAN TRAFFICKING HAS

01:33:05.846 --> 01:33:07.181
CERTAINLY GOTTEN WORSE AND

01:33:07.248 --> 01:33:08.649
AFFECTING COMMUNITIES OF OLOR

01:33:08.716 --> 01:33:11.218
OVER THE PANDEMIC- I DID WHAT I

01:33:11.285 --> 01:33:13.154
ALSO WANT TO JUST SAY THAT THE

01:33:13.220 --> 01:33:16.057
DROUGHT- IN RESILIENCE PACKAGE

01:33:16.123 --> 01:33:17.692
AND THE- THE WILDFIRE

01:33:17.758 --> 01:33:19.360
PREVENTION RESILIENCE. PACKAGE%

01:33:19.427 --> 01:33:20.861
THOSE DETAILS OF THEM HAVEN'T

01:33:20.928 --> 01:33:23.397
BEEN FLESHED OUT SO IT'S VERY

01:33:23.464 --> 01:33:25.032
IMPORTANT THAT AS WE VOTE FOR.

01:33:25.099 --> 01:33:26.434
THESE PROPOSALS THAT WE DON'T

01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:28.703
KNOW HOW THAT'S- HOUSE WHAT THE

01:33:28.769 --> 01:33:29.837
SPECIFICS ARE AND I THINK

01:33:29.904 --> 01:33:30.805
THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO

01:33:30.871 --> 01:33:33.374
EMPHASIZE- AND ESPECIALLY WHEN

01:33:33.441 --> 01:33:35.009
IT COMES TO DROUGHT AND WATER

01:33:35.076 --> 01:33:41.849
RESILIENCE- AND SIGMA. WE NEED.

01:33:41.916 --> 01:33:42.350
TO BE INVESTING IN WATER

01:33:42.416 --> 01:33:43.517
STORAGE. AND WATER AND FIRST-

01:33:43.584 --> 01:33:44.952
WE HAVE OPPORTUNITY IN THE

01:33:45.019 --> 01:33:47.688
PAST- THAT I BELIEVE THE STATE

01:33:47.755 --> 01:33:50.191
WASTED- WITH THE WATER FOR THE

01:33:50.257 --> 01:33:51.559
WATER BOND THAT THAT WAS

01:33:51.625 --> 01:33:55.062
PASSED. THAT DID NOT- PUT IN

01:33:55.129 --> 01:33:55.830
THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THIS

01:33:55.896 --> 01:33:57.798
WATER STORAGE- AND SO I DON'T

01:33:57.865 --> 01:33:59.967
BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD- LET

01:34:00.034 --> 01:34:01.435
THIS OPPORTUNITY GO AND IF WE

01:34:01.502 --> 01:34:02.603
IF WE DON'T INVEST IN WATER

01:34:02.670 --> 01:34:04.505
STORAGE. WITH THE WITH THE

01:34:04.572 --> 01:34:05.740
OPPORTUNITY THAT WE HAVE RIGHT

01:34:05.806 --> 01:34:08.409
NOW- I THINK OUR STATE WILL

01:34:08.476 --> 01:34:10.211
REGRET. THE LACK OF INVESTMENT

01:34:10.277 --> 01:34:11.479
FOR THE NEXT DROUGHT COMES

01:34:11.545 --> 01:34:14.415
AROUND. AND AND I THINK IT'S A

01:34:14.482 --> 01:34:17.084
AND THE EFFECTS OF. A SIGMA

01:34:17.151 --> 01:34:19.220
WILL BE- MORE SEVERE IN OUR

01:34:19.286 --> 01:34:21.122
COMMUNITIES BECAUSE WE CANNOT

01:34:21.188 --> 01:34:22.590
GET TO SUSTAINABILITY WHICH IS

01:34:22.656 --> 01:34:24.658
WHAT SIGNAL WANTED. WITHOUT

01:34:24.725 --> 01:34:26.427
THESE NEEDED INVESTMENTS SO.

01:34:26.494 --> 01:34:28.796
WHILE WE HAVE THIS DEBATE-

01:34:28.863 --> 01:34:32.633
RIGHT NOW- A LOT OF DETAILS ARE

01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:35.803
STILL. NOT DONE AND THAT'S AN

01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:37.838
IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE TO THE

01:34:37.905 --> 01:34:39.740
PUBLIC- THAT A LOT OF WORK

01:34:39.807 --> 01:34:41.809
STILL REMAINS IN SO WE AS A

01:34:41.876 --> 01:34:43.544
LEGISLATIVE BODY- NEED TO COME

01:34:43.611 --> 01:34:44.478
TOGETHER TO FIND THOSE

01:34:44.545 --> 01:34:47.882
SOLUTIONS SO I I'M OUT I'LL

A VERY BIPARTISAN MANNER-

01:41:22.242 --> 01:41:23.677

NO ONE DOESN'T RATE THE FUNDING

01:43:29.169 --> 01:43:31.204

JUST RESTART WHY WE KIND OF

BENSON WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF

COMMUNITY RESILIENCE MORE

01:46:46.666 --> 01:46:48.735
GENERALLY AND THE IDEA BEHIND

01:46:48.802 --> 01:46:50.604
THAT WAS TO. BASICALLY WORK

01:46:50.670 --> 01:46:52.105
WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NOT

01:46:52.172 --> 01:46:53.340
ENOUGH I WITH THEIR GREATEST

01:46:53.406 --> 01:46:55.142

DEFICIENCY PERSEVERATION BUT

01:47:03.717 --> 01:47:05.786
IT'S NOT FOR ALL. SO RATHER

01:47:05.852 --> 01:47:06.720
THAN HAVING ONE SPECIFIC

01:47:06.787 --> 01:47:08.989
SMALLER PART OF MONEY LIMITED

01:47:09.055 --> 01:47:10.657
TO THAT ONE PURPOSE WE PROPOSED

01:47:10.724 --> 01:47:12.292
A LARGER APPROPRIATE A LARGER

01:47:12.359 --> 01:47:14.795

FOR MORE GENERAL ALL HAZARDS

01:47:16.463 --> 01:47:18.031
APPROACH AND THAT WOULD BE

01:47:18.098 --> 01:47:19.900
ADMINISTERED BY WORKING WITH

01:47:19.966 --> 01:47:22.869

NEEDS A THE STATE IS GONNA BE

01:47:37.484 --> 01:47:40.353
HAPPY REDUCE- PORTLAND. SO

01:47:40.420 --> 01:47:44.191
WOULD CITIES AND TRIBES AND

01:47:44.257 --> 01:47:45.358
SPECIAL DISTRICTS TO BE ABLE TO

01:47:45.425 --> 01:47:49.830

THE TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR

01:48:00.707 --> 01:48:02.275
PROPOSAL WAS VERY FLEXIBLE IN

PARDONING AND A LOT OF

01:48:07.948 --> 01:48:09.182
DIFFERENT WAYS SO THAT THOSE

01:48:09.249 --> 01:48:11.284
WOULD BE POTENTIALLY NOT

01:48:11.351 --> 01:48:14.621

U. I. DEBT WAS TO PICK TO USE

01:51:55.742 --> 01:51:56.810
ABOUT ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN

01:51:56.876 --> 01:51:59.412
ARCA. CHIU TO PAY DOWN A

01:51:59.479 --> 01:52:01.915
PORTION OF THE BALANCE- AND AS

01:52:01.981 --> 01:52:03.850
YOU NOTED EXPECTED TO BE TWENTY

01:52:03.917 --> 01:52:05.085
ACCESS TO TWENTY FOUR BILLION

01:52:05.151 --> 01:52:06.686
AT THE END OF THE CALENDAR

01:52:06.753 --> 01:52:09.622
YEAR- SIMILAR TO- AS OF RIGHT

01:52:09.689 --> 01:52:11.524
NOW THE APPROACH WITH- AT THIS

01:52:11.591 --> 01:52:13.693
CURRENT BUDGET WISE TO. USE

01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:14.894
SOME OF THE FEDERAL DOLLARS TO

01:52:14.961 --> 01:52:16.963
BUY THAT DOWN- OBVIOUSLY YOU

01:52:17.030 --> 01:52:18.398
KNOW CONVERSATIONS ON THE

01:52:18.465 --> 01:52:21.801
FUTURE IS ONGOING- BUT AS I

01:52:21.868 --> 01:52:24.270
WOULD JUST NOTE THAT. BASED ON

01:52:24.337 --> 01:52:26.206
THAT THE GREAT RECESSION- THE

01:52:26.272 --> 01:52:29.676
PAY DOWN OF THAT DEBT- WAS-

01:52:29.742 --> 01:52:32.278
DONE THROUGH THAT GRADUAL

01:52:32.345 --> 01:52:36.349
INCREASES TO THE- FEDERAL- TAX

01:52:36.416 --> 01:52:39.352
CREDIT FOR EMPLOYERS TO PAY SO.

01:52:39.419 --> 01:52:41.387
OVER TIE THAT WOULD BE- BORNE

01:52:41.454 --> 01:52:43.656
BY I'M INCREASES TO EMPLOYERS

01:52:43.723 --> 01:52:45.992
SO TAX CHANGES WERE MADE SO IN

01:52:46.059 --> 01:52:46.993
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

01:52:47.060 --> 01:52:48.828
TAXPAYERS BUSINESSES ARE GOING

01:52:48.895 --> 01:52:50.396
TO HAVE TO FORK OVER THE MONEY

01:52:50.463 --> 01:52:51.631
OVER THE NEXT YOU KNOW DECADE

01:52:51.698 --> 01:52:55.268
PLUS. TO PAY DOWN YOU KNOW WHAT

01:52:55.335 --> 01:52:55.835
SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED IN THE

01:52:55.902 --> 01:52:58.004
FIRST PLACE. SO ABSENT IN

01:52:58.071 --> 01:52:59.873
CORRECT SO ABSENT ANY CHANGES

01:52:59.939 --> 01:53:02.142
TO THE- THE FINANCING STRUCTURE

01:53:02.208 --> 01:53:04.477
OF THE U. R. PROGRAM- THOSE

01:53:04.544 --> 01:53:07.347
ADS. THAT THE RATES WILL BE

01:53:07.413 --> 01:53:10.183
INCREASING OR THAT THAT CREDITS

01:53:10.250 --> 01:53:12.152
WOULD BE REDUCED TO EMPLOYERS.

01:53:12.218 --> 01:53:14.888
AND THEN- THEREBY INCREASING

01:53:14.954 --> 01:53:15.755
THE TAX THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO

01:53:15.822 --> 01:53:18.024
PAY TO GO INTO THE- YOU ARE SO

01:53:18.091 --> 01:53:19.492
THIS IS REALLY DISTRESSING ONE

01:53:19.559 --> 01:53:21.194
THIS IS AN EXTREMELY DISTURBING

01:53:21.261 --> 01:53:22.662
TO ME ESPECIALLY WHEN WE LOOK

01:53:22.729 --> 01:53:26.499
AT. WE HAVE A PROPOSED- TWO

01:53:26.566 --> 01:53:27.534
HUNDRED BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND

01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:29.235
FORTY AND TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY

01:53:29.302 --> 01:53:30.770
BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET THIS YEAR

01:53:30.837 --> 01:53:33.373
LAST YEAR'S BUDGET- WAS HALF OF

01:53:33.439 --> 01:53:36.176
THIS. AND WHETHER IT IS EASY D.

01:53:36.242 --> 01:53:38.811
DEBT WHETHER IT IS DEFERRALS-

01:53:38.878 --> 01:53:41.781
WHETHER IT IS A YOU KNOW A-

01:53:41.848 --> 01:53:43.650
PENSION LIABILITIES WHETHER IT

01:53:43.716 --> 01:53:45.185
IS LOOMING FINANCIAL CRISIS

01:53:45.251 --> 01:53:48.121
THAT ARE- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE

01:53:48.188 --> 01:53:50.823
GONNA BE FACING ARE FACING- WE

01:53:50.890 --> 01:53:52.792
SHOULD BE USING THIS AS AS AN

01:53:52.859 --> 01:53:54.594
OPPORTUNITY. TO BECOME

01:53:54.661 --> 01:53:56.930
FINANCIALLY SOLVENT THIS IS A

01:53:56.996 --> 01:53:58.531
LOT OF MONEY AND IT'S REALLY

01:53:58.598 --> 01:54:01.134
UPSETTING THAT WERE NOT BEING

01:54:01.201 --> 01:54:01.734
FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE THANK

01:54:01.801 --> 01:54:06.873
YOU- I WOULD JUST. RESPECTFULLY

01:54:06.940 --> 01:54:07.507
DISAGREE WITH WHAT YOU'RE WHAT

01:54:07.574 --> 01:54:09.776
YOU JUST STATED- THE STATE IT

01:54:09.842 --> 01:54:12.378
IS IN A STRONGER. FINANCIAL

01:54:12.445 --> 01:54:15.915
CONDITION AS IT'S BEEN IN THE-

01:54:15.982 --> 01:54:16.516
ALMOST NINE YEARS I'VE BEEN IN

01:54:16.583 --> 01:54:19.152
THE LEGISLATURE- AGAIN WE POINT

01:54:19.219 --> 01:54:20.720
TO THE TWENTY OF THE RECORD-

01:54:20.787 --> 01:54:22.555
NUMBER AMOUNT OF RESERVES

01:54:22.622 --> 01:54:24.057
TWENTY FIVE BILLION. IN TERMS

01:54:24.123 --> 01:54:27.060
OF THE U. I. TAX THE STRUCTURE.

01:54:27.126 --> 01:54:29.996
OF THE TAX REMAINS IN TERMS OF

01:54:30.063 --> 01:54:30.530
THE INTEGRITY OF THE TAX

01:54:30.597 --> 01:54:32.732
REMAINS WHICH IS. IS A TAX THAT

01:54:32.799 --> 01:54:36.069
IS PAID. BY EMPLOYERS FOR.

01:54:36.135 --> 01:54:37.503
THEIR EMPLOYEES WHEN THEY ARE

01:54:37.570 --> 01:54:39.839
UNEMPLOYEDAND THAT IS WHAT THE

01:54:39.906 --> 01:54:42.575
TAXES AND THAT IS WHAT- REMAIN

01:54:42.642 --> 01:54:44.811
SO IT IS UP TO US IF WE WANT TO

01:54:44.877 --> 01:54:46.913
DEBATE THE- PURPOSE OF THE

01:54:46.980 --> 01:54:47.747
TAXES WAS THE USE OF THE TAX

01:54:47.814 --> 01:54:49.582
FOR THE FUTURE. BUT I THINK THE

01:54:49.649 --> 01:54:51.818
FISCAL FACTS REMAIN THAT THE

01:54:51.884 --> 01:54:53.620
STATE IS IN A STRONGER

01:54:53.686 --> 01:54:56.022
FINANCIAL POSITION AS IT'S BEEN

01:54:56.089 --> 01:54:57.290
IN A VERY LONG TIME WHEN I GO

01:54:57.357 --> 01:54:59.726
TO THE DOCTOR WOULDN'T MISTER

01:54:59.792 --> 01:55:01.861
LACK. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY

HAPPY ABOUT AND- AND THE

01:55:08.668 --> 01:55:09.802
COLLECTIVE WORK OF THE ASSEMBLY

01:55:09.869 --> 01:55:11.838
BUDGET COMMITTEES AND- I KNOW

01:55:11.904 --> 01:55:12.739
THE SENATE ON THE OTHER SIDE AS

01:55:12.805 --> 01:55:14.340
WELL. IT'S GREAT TO SEE US IN

01:55:14.407 --> 01:55:16.342
AGREEMENT HERE ON ON THIS I

01:55:16.409 --> 01:55:18.111
PARTICULARLY WANT TO. BE SAY

01:55:18.177 --> 01:55:20.113
HOW THANKFUL I AM TO SEE THE

01:55:20.179 --> 01:55:21.281
MONEY FOR PUBLIC HEALTH

01:55:21.347 --> 01:55:23.683
INFRASTRUCTURE. WE'VE TALKED

01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:24.317
ABOUT I THINK IT'S CRITICAL AS

01:55:24.384 --> 01:55:26.886
WE MOVE FORWARD- ALSO- THRILLED

01:55:26.953 --> 01:55:28.888
TO SEE FUNDING FOR A BILL THAT

01:55:28.955 --> 01:55:30.123
I PASSED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.

01:55:30.189 --> 01:55:31.824
AROUND HOME HARDENING AS WE

01:55:31.891 --> 01:55:33.926
ENTER WILDFIRE SEASON HERE- IT

01:55:33.993 --> 01:55:34.994
SOMETIMES THESE THINGS TAKE

01:55:35.061 --> 01:55:36.329
AWHILE WAITED A COUPLE YEARS

01:55:36.396 --> 01:55:39.132
FOR THAT AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN

01:55:39.198 --> 01:55:40.300
SEE PROGRESS. PROGRESS THERE. I

01:55:40.366 --> 01:55:41.768
DIDN'T WANT TO SAY A COUPLE OF

01:55:41.834 --> 01:55:44.437
THINGS THAT. AROUND JUST JUST

01:55:44.504 --> 01:55:48.241
RESOURCES IN GENERAL AND AS I

01:55:48.308 --> 01:55:49.709
THINK ABOUT THIS THIS IS. THIS

01:55:49.776 --> 01:55:51.077
IS PROBABLY A ONCE IN A

01:55:51.144 --> 01:55:52.612
LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY FOR US

01:55:52.679 --> 01:55:53.813
WITH THESE KINDS OF RESOURCES

01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:55.615
WERE SEEN NOW. AT CERTAINLY A

01:55:55.682 --> 01:55:57.150
ONCE IN A LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY

01:55:57.216 --> 01:55:58.017
FOR THOSE OF US WHILE WE'RE

01:55:58.084 --> 01:56:02.622
HERE- IN THE LEGISLATURE. AND I

01:56:02.689 --> 01:56:06.959
REFLECT THAT- I HOPE AND I KNOW

01:56:07.026 --> 01:56:08.594
THAT THIS LEGISLATURE. IN OUR

01:56:08.661 --> 01:56:11.864
OVERSIGHT ROLE WILL REALLY. TRY

01:56:11.931 --> 01:56:14.067
TO PUSH FOR THIS. BUT SOMETIMES

01:56:14.133 --> 01:56:15.301
JUST HAVING A LOT OF MONEY AND

01:56:15.368 --> 01:56:17.170
PUSHING IT OUT INTO PROGRAMS

01:56:17.236 --> 01:56:18.538
ISN'T GOING TO SOLVE ALL THE

01:56:18.604 --> 01:56:21.040
PROBLEMS AND- I BELIEVE THAT-

01:56:21.107 --> 01:56:22.875
THERE ARE A LOT OF- SILOS IN

01:56:22.942 --> 01:56:24.410
GOVERNMENT. THERE'S A LOT OF

01:56:24.477 --> 01:56:26.312
LACK OF COORDINATION AND

01:56:26.379 --> 01:56:28.081
ESPECIALLY AND I'VE I KNOW I'VE

01:56:28.147 --> 01:56:29.549
BROUGHT THIS UP ON THE FLOOR

01:56:29.615 --> 01:56:31.517
MAYBE YESTERDAY OR OR FRIDAY.

01:56:31.584 --> 01:56:33.219
JUST THE CHALLENGES AROUND HOW

01:56:33.286 --> 01:56:34.420
WE DEAL WITH HOMELESSNESS

01:56:34.487 --> 01:56:36.055
THERE'S SO MANY FACES OF

01:56:36.122 --> 01:56:38.257
HOMELESSNESS OR SO MANY. CAUSES

01:56:38.324 --> 01:56:40.360
OF HOMELESSNESS. AND THERE

01:56:40.426 --> 01:56:41.594
DOESN'T FEEL LIKE THERE'S A LOT

01:56:41.661 --> 01:56:44.530
OF COORDINATION- AND SO THIS

01:56:44.597 --> 01:56:45.698
IS- THIS IS KIND OF A PLEA FOR

01:56:45.765 --> 01:56:48.134
THAT- AND I KNOW THAT IN WE

01:56:48.201 --> 01:56:49.502
ALSO SEE A LOT OF DUPLICATION.

01:56:49.569 --> 01:56:53.740
WELL A LOT BUT MAYBE THAT'S

01:56:53.806 --> 01:56:54.774
MAYBE THAT'S A STRETCH THERE IS

01:56:54.841 --> 01:56:56.175
DEFINITELY DUPLICATION OF

01:56:56.242 --> 01:56:58.244
THINGS IN. STATE GOVERNMENT WE

01:56:58.311 --> 01:56:59.612
FOUND THAT IN TO OUR AUDITING

01:56:59.679 --> 01:57:01.814
PROCESS WORK ONE DEPARTMENT

01:57:01.881 --> 01:57:02.348
DOESN'T REALIZE THE OTHER

01:57:02.415 --> 01:57:03.716
DEPARTMENT IS DOING THE SAME

01:57:03.783 --> 01:57:05.618
THING. AND THEY'RE NOT TALKING

01:57:05.685 --> 01:57:06.853
TO ONE ANOTHER. SO THAT'S

01:57:06.919 --> 01:57:08.755
WASTE. THAT'S WAYS THEY CAN BE

01:57:08.821 --> 01:57:10.823
AVOIDED SO I HOPE WITH THIS

01:57:10.890 --> 01:57:12.191
UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNT OF

01:57:12.258 --> 01:57:14.494
RESOURCES GOING IN. TO PROVIDE

01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:16.763
SOME REALLY VALUABLE SERVICES

01:57:16.829 --> 01:57:18.831
THAT IS COORDINATED. THAT

01:57:18.898 --> 01:57:21.834
THERE'S ACCOUNTABILITY. AND

01:57:21.901 --> 01:57:26.672
THAT WE GET IT RIGHT. THANK YOU.

01:57:26.739 --> 01:57:28.908
THANK YOU WERE GOING TO MISTER

01:57:28.975 --> 01:57:31.611
LUCKY AND THEN TO MISTER MATHIS.

01:57:31.677 --> 01:57:34.147
WELL THANK YOU I DON'T HAVE.

01:57:34.213 --> 01:57:34.881
ANY OF BURNING QUITE WELL I

01:57:34.947 --> 01:57:36.215
HAVE SEVERAL BURNING QUESTIONS

01:57:36.282 --> 01:57:37.650
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO BE LABOR

01:57:37.717 --> 01:57:40.019
THEM AT THIS POINT I DID WANT

01:57:40.086 --> 01:57:42.922
TO MAKE IT. A COMMENT THAT- TO

01:57:42.989 --> 01:57:45.658
THIS POINT OUR BUDGET PROCESSES

01:57:45.725 --> 01:57:48.094
HAD VIGOROUS DISCUSSIONS AND

01:57:48.161 --> 01:57:50.396
EXCHANGE OF PERSPECTIVES HAS

01:57:50.463 --> 01:57:52.632
BEEN SOMETHING I'M VERY VERY

01:57:52.698 --> 01:57:54.167
PROUD TO HAVE PARTICIPATED IN.

01:57:54.233 --> 01:57:56.169
IT IS AN HONOR TO WITNESS THIS

01:57:56.235 --> 01:57:58.204
LEVEL OF LEADERSHIP AS WELL BY.

01:57:58.271 --> 01:57:59.639
BOTH THE STRUCTURES AND I

01:57:59.705 --> 01:58:01.741
PARTICIPATED IN BOTH AND SUB

01:58:01.808 --> 01:58:04.644
BOARDS OF FIVE. HOWEVER IN.

01:58:04.710 --> 01:58:05.645
THIS PART OF THE PROCESS I'D

01:58:05.711 --> 01:58:07.613
SAY WERE. SOMEWHERE AROUND HALF

01:58:07.680 --> 01:58:11.818
TIME- AS WELL AS WAS MENTIONED

01:58:11.884 --> 01:58:12.385
EARLIER TODAY THIS IS STILL

01:58:12.452 --> 01:58:15.021
VERY EARLY. AND IN THE DECISION

01:58:15.087 --> 01:58:17.056
MAKING TREE AND THERE'S BEEN

01:58:17.123 --> 01:58:19.258
HOURS AND HOURS AND HOURS OF

01:58:19.325 --> 01:58:22.929
REVIEW. A PERSPECTIVE SHARED.

01:58:22.995 --> 01:58:26.566
AND I FEEL LIKE IN YEARS PAST.

01:58:26.632 --> 01:58:29.001
THIS PARTY FROM THIS POINT BACK

01:58:29.068 --> 01:58:30.269
IS SOMETHING TO BE VERY PROUD

01:58:30.336 --> 01:58:32.071
OF WHAT WHAT HAPPENS FROM THIS

01:58:32.138 --> 01:58:34.173
POINT FORWARD. AS A IT SEEMS

01:58:34.240 --> 01:58:37.310
LIKE. THE PROCESS AND

01:58:37.376 --> 01:58:38.511
INFORMATION BECOMES WAY MORE

01:58:38.578 --> 01:58:42.815
GUARDED. AND LESS OPENLY SHARED

01:58:42.882 --> 01:58:45.017
AND LESSENING GAUGING AND I

01:58:45.084 --> 01:58:46.018
DON'T WE DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH

01:58:46.085 --> 01:58:48.321
CONTROL OVER THAT BUT IT IS A

01:58:48.387 --> 01:58:50.890
OF RUSTRATION FOR ME THE SO

01:58:50.957 --> 01:58:53.192
MUCH WORK GETS PUT IN. TO OUR

01:58:53.259 --> 01:58:55.394
ENGAGEMENT AND ITS ROBUSTNESS

01:58:55.461 --> 01:58:58.331
NOT BE VERY PROUD OF AND THEN A

01:58:58.397 --> 01:58:58.931
LOT OF IT JUST KIND OF GOES UP

01:58:58.998 --> 01:59:01.701
AND- SMOKE FOR LACK OF A BETTER

01:59:01.767 --> 01:59:03.736
TERM AND- IT'S A- IT'S A STRONG

01:59:03.803 --> 01:59:05.238
FRUSTRATION OF MINE AND I JUST

01:59:05.304 --> 01:59:07.406
WANTED TO. EXPRESS IT BECAUSE

01:59:07.473 --> 01:59:09.876
IT MAKES ME FEEL BETTER. BUT IT

01:59:09.942 --> 01:59:10.343
BUT IT IT REALLY IS A
