WHEN THEY'VE BEEN SUFFERING SO

01:37:02.616 --> 01:37:05.152
MUCH THROUGH QUOTED. SO IN THIS

01:37:05.219 --> 01:37:06.787
CASE YOU HAVE AN AUTHOR WHO

01:37:06.854 --> 01:37:08.088
WANTS TO PROTECT THE TICKET

01:37:08.155 --> 01:37:09.790
GOERS BUT I ALSO WANT TO

01:37:09.857 --> 01:37:11.292
PROTECT THE THEATRES SO WILL

01:37:11.358 --> 01:37:12.660
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM TO

01:37:12.726 --> 01:37:13.627
MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS

01:37:13.694 --> 01:37:15.763
SOMETHING THAT. THAT DOESN'T-

01:37:15.829 --> 01:37:17.164
PENALIZE THE GOOD ACTORS OUT

01:37:17.231 --> 01:37:20.100
THERE THE SUBSCRIPTION MODEL

01:37:20.167 --> 01:37:20.768
CANCELLATION WITH SOMETHING

01:37:20.834 --> 01:37:22.503
THAT ACTUALLY HADN'T REALLY

01:37:22.570 --> 01:37:23.604
OCCURRED TO US THAT THAT WOULD

01:37:23.671 --> 01:37:25.806
BE A TRIGGERED BY THIS I IT

01:37:25.873 --> 01:37:28.676
WASN'T OUR INTENTION TO HAVE A-

01:37:28.742 --> 01:37:29.510
BEER COMPANY WHERE YOU

WHOLE YEAR MAYBE THEY HAVE TO

SWAP ONE SHOW OUT FOR THE

01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:34.715
OTHER. AND WILL ABSOLUTELY MAKE

01:37:34.782 --> 01:37:35.950
SURE THAT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING

01:37:36.016 --> 01:37:38.619
THAT- IS AFFECTED BY THIS SO

01:37:38.686 --> 01:37:39.954
WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL

01:37:40.020 --> 01:37:41.822

01:37:43.390 --> 01:37:44.291
THEATER OPERATORS IN MY

01:37:44.358 --> 01:37:46.393
DISTRICT AND HOPEFULLY NO MORE

01:37:46.460 --> 01:37:48.162
VERY ANGRY CONSUMERS WHO END UP

01:37:48.229 --> 01:37:50.764
GETTING STUCK WITH A TICKET FOR

01:37:50.831 --> 01:37:51.265

ONE USE THAT- I- UNDER THAT

01:38:00.407 --> 01:38:02.309
WOULD BE FUN POLICY WASHED

01:38:02.376 --> 01:38:04.345
THERE ARE THERE WAS MUCH OF A

01:38:04.411 --> 01:38:07.248
PROBLEM AND THAT THE- ARE YOU A

BEER SPECIFIES A DATE WITHIN

01:38:10.317 --> 01:38:13.087
THIRTY DAYS. SO THAT IS-

01:38:13.153 --> 01:38:15.623
KNOWLEDGE RESTRAINING AND

01:38:15.689 --> 01:38:19.493

NEXT YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWO.

01:38:25.432 --> 01:38:27.134
CORRECT SO IF THAT'S THE CASE

01:38:27.201 --> 01:38:31.338

01:38:34.208 --> 01:38:40.381
DRAMATIC- EXPERIENCE OF THAT.

STUFF OR SO MANY- EVENTS WERE

01:38:41.482 --> 01:38:43.817
CANCER THE- HOPE WELL WE NOT

01:38:43.884 --> 01:38:48.355
REPEAT SO I'M WHY THE THIS-

01:38:48.422 --> 01:38:51.025
THE- ALL THE CANCELLATIONS-

01:38:51.091 --> 01:38:53.527
THAT WERE MADE DUE TO.

01:38:53.594 --> 01:38:55.663
CORPORATE NINETEEN HAVE BEEN OR

01:38:55.729 --> 01:38:58.365
RESOLVE THE LAW ON RESULT IN

01:38:58.432 --> 01:39:01.101
THERE WITH THE- DISCUSSION

01:39:01.168 --> 01:39:02.503
SHOULD BE MADE TO

01:39:02.569 --> 01:39:04.838
RETROACTIVELY. RESIDENTS IN THE

01:39:04.905 --> 01:39:06.974
FUTURE NEXT YEAR ON- JUST

01:39:07.041 --> 01:39:09.710
HOPING THAT THIS KIND OF A

01:39:09.777 --> 01:39:12.279
MASSIVE A- CANCELLATION WOULD

01:39:12.346 --> 01:39:14.715
NOT HAPPEN SO YOU'LL BE IT

01:39:14.782 --> 01:39:17.084
WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE. IF YOU

01:39:17.151 --> 01:39:22.890
TRY TO- ATTACKED CONSUMERS OF

01:39:22.956 --> 01:39:25.159
WHAT VICTIMIZED AND THE-

01:39:25.225 --> 01:39:28.896
INTENSELY. REFUNDS ONE ON MADE

FOUGHT AYE I THINK PROBABLY THE

01:39:33.901 --> 01:39:36.203
BEST WE CAN DO IS HOPE THAT. AS

01:39:36.270 --> 01:39:37.338
THE BILL PASSES AND HOPEFULLY

01:39:37.404 --> 01:39:38.505
WILL PASS THAT THE BIGGER

01:39:38.572 --> 01:39:40.007
COMPANIES WILL START TO ISSUE

01:39:40.074 --> 01:39:41.975
THE REFUNDS THAT RE IN ARREARS

01:39:42.042 --> 01:39:43.277

JANUARY FEBRUARY OF NEXT YEAR.

01:39:46.914 --> 01:39:47.881
BUT THERE'S HOPE FOR SOME OF

01:39:47.948 --> 01:39:49.183
THEM AND IN TERMS OF WHETHER

01:39:49.249 --> 01:39:51.251

GONE THROUGH THE WEBSITES IN

01:39:55.622 --> 01:39:57.324
THE PAGES OF A LOT OF THE

01:39:57.391 --> 01:39:58.826
TICKET SELLERS AND THIS IS A

01:39:58.892 --> 01:40:00.294
HUGE SOURCE OF CONSUMER

01:40:00.361 --> 01:40:01.595
COMPLAINTS THERE ARE A LOT OF

01:40:01.662 --> 01:40:02.763
PEOPLE OUT THERE. THAT I'VE

BEEN WAITING FOR MONTHS AND

01:40:03.964 --> 01:40:05.699
MONTHS AND MONTHS AND MONTHS

01:40:07.301 --> 01:40:08.402
HAVE NOT GOTTEN REFUNDS FOR

01:40:08.469 --> 01:40:10.971
SHOWS SO- THIS SEEMS TO BE A

01:40:11.038 --> 01:40:12.706
BIG PROBLEM I COULDN'T TELL YOU

01:40:12.773 --> 01:40:14.375
HOW BIG OF A PROBLEM IT WAS PRE

01:40:14.441 --> 01:40:15.409
CODED BUT THERE WAS STILL SOME

01:40:15.476 --> 01:40:17.010
ISSUE. AND THERE STILL HAVE

01:40:17.077 --> 01:40:19.279

CANCELLATIONS FOR ALL MANNERS

01:40:20.247 --> 01:40:23.617
OF THINGS- SO- I DO HOPE THAT

01:40:23.684 --> 01:40:25.018
IT SENDS A SIGNAL TO THE TICKET

01:40:25.085 --> 01:40:26.286
SELLERS THAT YOU KNOW THEY NEED

01:40:26.353 --> 01:40:27.788

AND I AGREE WITH YOU I

01:40:31.058 --> 01:40:32.192
CERTAINLY HOPE THAT WE HAVE

01:40:32.259 --> 01:40:33.160
LESS CANCELLATIONS AND THAT

01:40:33.227 --> 01:40:35.062
OUR- THEATERS CAN GO BACK AND

01:40:35.129 --> 01:40:36.630
HOPEFULLY THRIVE. PEOPLE WANT

01:40:36.697 --> 01:40:38.732
TO GET OUT OF THEIR HOUSE AND

01:40:38.799 --> 01:40:40.601
GET SOME ENTERTAINMENT. YEAH I

01:40:40.667 --> 01:40:43.270
JUST HOPE THAT THE NORMAL OF

CONVENE NINETEEN KIND OF US

01:40:44.571 --> 01:40:46.440

MY UNDERSTANDING THE SHEL SHEER

01:42:18.999 --> 01:42:21.468
VOLUME OF CANCELLATIONS THAT

01:42:21.535 --> 01:42:22.603
HAD TO HAPPEN BECAUSE OF

01:42:22.669 --> 01:42:24.605

CONTINUE TO TALK TO THE

01:42:44.458 --> 01:42:45.425
INDUSTRY TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S

01:42:45.492 --> 01:42:46.627
FEASIBLE WHAT WE DON'T WANT IS

01:42:46.693 --> 01:42:47.861
JUST TO HAVE LANGUAGE THAT'S

01:42:47.928 --> 01:42:50.631
VERY OPEN ENDED LIKE INITIATE

01:42:50.697 --> 01:42:51.798

INITIATED IT IT'S BEEN FOUR

01:42:55.002 --> 01:42:56.103
MONTHS BUT IT'S NOT OUR PROBLEM

01:42:56.169 --> 01:42:57.804
ANYMORE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:42:57.871 --> 01:43:00.374
THAT THERE IS SOME SENSE THAT

01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:00.974
YOU HAVE A CERTAIN THAT YOU'VE

01:43:01.041 --> 01:43:02.042
YOU'VE TAKEN SOMEONE'S MONEY.

01:43:02.109 --> 01:43:03.210
AND NOW IT'S UP TO YOU TO GET

01:43:03.277 --> 01:43:04.177
THE MONEY BACK TO THEM YOU

01:43:04.244 --> 01:43:05.212
CAN'T JUST WASH YOUR HANDS OF

01:43:05.279 --> 01:43:06.680
IT WALK AWAY AND SAY THAT IT'S

01:43:06.747 --> 01:43:08.482
SOMEONE ELSE'S PROBLEM BUT WE

01:43:08.549 --> 01:43:09.683
WILL WORK WITH THEM TO SAY WHAT

01:43:09.750 --> 01:43:11.652
WE KNOW HOW REALLY CAN WE MAKE

01:43:11.718 --> 01:43:12.219
THIS WORK HOW LONG THIS IS

01:43:12.286 --> 01:43:15.589
REALLY TAKE- AND I AGREE THAT-

01:43:15.656 --> 01:43:16.557
BUT IT'S CERTAINLY EXACERBATED

01:43:16.623 --> 01:43:18.025
THIS BUT THESE WERE COMPLAINTS

01:43:18.091 --> 01:43:18.892
THAT WERE COMING IN BEFORE

01:43:18.959 --> 01:43:20.761
COLLUDED TO. YOU KNOW A ROCK

01:43:20.827 --> 01:43:22.329
CONCERT GETS CANCELED BECAUSE

01:43:22.396 --> 01:43:26.600
THE LEAD SINGER. LOSES THEIR

01:43:26.667 --> 01:43:27.701
VOICE. AT THE SOMETIMES THESE

01:43:27.768 --> 01:43:28.302
HAVE THESE BEEN PROP. IN THE-

01:43:28.368 --> 01:43:33.140
AS WELL. SO BUT ABSOLUTELY. I

01:43:33.206 --> 01:43:34.341
HAVE A LOT OF THEATERS IN MY

01:43:34.408 --> 01:43:36.243
DISTRICT AND I CERTAINLY DON'T

01:43:36.310 --> 01:43:37.411
WANT ANY OF THEM UPSET AT ME

01:43:37.477 --> 01:43:39.179
EITHER. AND I ALSO DON'T WANT

01:43:39.246 --> 01:43:40.747
TO HURT THEM. I WANT THEM TO

01:43:40.814 --> 01:43:42.282
SUCCEED SO I THINK THAT WE WILL

01:43:42.349 --> 01:43:43.684
FIND THE RIGHT BALANCE HERE TO

01:43:43.750 --> 01:43:44.284
MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE

01:43:44.351 --> 01:43:46.820
PROTECTIONS BUT WE DO SOMETHING

01:43:46.887 --> 01:43:47.421
THAT'S- EVERYONE SAYS OH YEAH
