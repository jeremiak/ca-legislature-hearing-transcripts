WE ADMINISTER AT THE CONCEPTS

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:34.826

ANY OF THESE GIVEN POPULATIONS

00:31:40.098 --> 00:31:41.899
BUT ALSO THAT CONNECTION BACK

00:31:41.966 --> 00:31:43.801
TO HOW THIS PARTICULAR THIS

00:31:43.868 --> 00:31:44.769

THROUGHOUT THE STRATEGIES LOCAL

00:31:48.473 --> 00:31:49.874
IN THE CASE THAT THERE'S

00:31:49.941 --> 00:31:51.776

EXPENSIVE PLACE TO LIVE OF.

00:34:07.645 --> 00:34:10.782
STUDENTS SO. I DON'T HAVE ANY

IN SAN JOSE- IT'S NOT ON

00:34:16.854 --> 00:34:20.091
AFFORDABLE AREA. THERE'S A LOT

00:34:20.158 --> 00:34:21.392

OUR STATE COLLEGES AND

UNIVERSITIES. SO DO YOU HAVE A

00:34:31.869 --> 00:34:36.741
SPECIFIC. SEPARATE APPROACH TO

DEALING WITH. WORKING WITH THE

00:34:39.410 --> 00:34:44.649
INSTITUTIONS. OF TO SOLVE THE

00:34:44.715 --> 00:34:46.984
STUDENT HOMELESS PROBLEM IS TO

00:34:47.051 --> 00:34:54.258
ARM. I THINK IT IT BEARS SELECT

00:34:54.325 --> 00:34:55.359
OR SOME KIND OF WORKING

00:34:55.426 --> 00:34:57.728
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE STATE

00:34:57.795 --> 00:34:59.897
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES THE

00:34:59.964 --> 00:35:02.800
COMMUNITY COLLEGES OF THE

00:35:02.867 --> 00:35:03.901
CHANCELLOR THE COLLEGES ALL THE

00:35:03.968 --> 00:35:06.971
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS SO DO YOU

00:35:07.038 --> 00:35:11.275
HAVE ANY. OF SEPARATE

00:35:11.342 --> 00:35:12.910
APPROACHES ARE STRATEGIES

00:35:12.977 --> 00:35:14.312
RELATED TO- STUDENT

00:35:14.378 --> 00:35:18.549
HOMELESSNESS. YES OF THE

00:35:18.616 --> 00:35:20.251
CALIFORNIA'S ME COLLEGES WAS

00:35:20.318 --> 00:35:22.687
JUST INCLUDED ON OUR COUNCIL IN

00:35:22.753 --> 00:35:23.788
THIS LAST YEAR'S AND A

00:35:23.855 --> 00:35:25.990
STATUTORY CHANGE IN LAST YEAR'S

00:35:26.057 --> 00:35:28.493
STATUTE SO THEY ARE NOW ON THE

00:35:28.559 --> 00:35:29.160

00:35:29.227 --> 00:35:30.561
MY CLOSELY THEY ALSO AND I

00:35:30.628 --> 00:35:32.029
CAN'T SPEAK FULLY DO THIS BUT

00:35:32.096 --> 00:35:33.564
THEY ALSO HAD SOME FUNDING

00:35:33.631 --> 00:35:34.899
GIVEN TO THEM LAST YEAR TO HELP

WE'RE HOPING TO DO AS WE THINK

00:35:47.111 --> 00:35:48.946
ABOUT THE HEAT AND A HALF

OVER TWENTY ONE AND IN SUPPORT

00:39:58.262 --> 00:39:59.497
CENTER NEEDED I THINK IS

00:39:59.563 --> 00:40:00.765
ANOTHER PIECE OF THIS NOT FOR

00:40:00.831 --> 00:40:02.433

PRIORITY FOR USE IN A INCLUDED

00:40:07.705 --> 00:40:09.874
AS WELL SO- ABSOLUTELY AGREE

00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:11.909
THAT WE HAVE TO KIND OF REALLY

00:40:11.976 --> 00:40:13.944
ENSURE THAT THAT- TRANSITIONAL

00:40:14.011 --> 00:40:15.546

00:40:15.613 --> 00:40:16.547
NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL AS THEY

00:40:16.614 --> 00:40:20.751
TRANSITION ON. OF THE WE DON'T

00:40:20.818 --> 00:40:22.586
HAVE ENOUGH AYE I THINK THE-

00:40:22.653 --> 00:40:25.523
ESTIMATED RECENTLY THAT WAS

00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:26.023
FIFTY THOUSAND HOMELESS

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:27.958
STUDENTS. AND A CALIFORNIA

00:40:28.025 --> 00:40:30.361
STATE COLLEGE SYSTEM- THAT

00:40:30.427 --> 00:40:32.163
DOESN'T DRY WITH OUR HOMELESS

00:40:32.229 --> 00:40:35.933
SENSES. AND IT IS VERY IT'S

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.968
VERY APPARENT. THAT THE

00:40:38.035 --> 00:40:40.704
STUDENTS ARE NOT COUNTED A LOT

00:40:40.771 --> 00:40:45.176
OF THE USE ARE COUNTED. WE

00:40:45.242 --> 00:40:47.778
DON'T HAVE A GOOD ACCURATE.

00:40:47.845 --> 00:40:49.013
ESTIMATE OF WHAT THE SCALE OF

00:40:49.079 --> 00:40:52.983
THE PROBLEM IS. AND THEREFORE

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:54.552
WE SHOULD DEVELOP SOME

00:40:54.618 --> 00:40:58.222
STRATEGIES SEPARATE TO THAT

00:40:58.289 --> 00:41:01.158
PARTICULAR PROBLEM BECAUSE WE

00:41:01.225 --> 00:41:02.560
DON'T HAVE A GOOD HANDLE ON

00:41:02.626 --> 00:41:04.595
WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE WITH

00:41:04.662 --> 00:41:06.864
JUNE HOMELESSNESS. IS NOT

00:41:06.931 --> 00:41:09.300
APPARENT RIGHT NOW THE COUNTS

00:41:09.366 --> 00:41:12.837
DON'T PICK UP THESE PEOPLE OF.

00:41:12.903 --> 00:41:15.306
AND I'M AFRAID I'M AFRAID THEIR

00:41:15.372 --> 00:41:19.176
PHONE AND BETWEEN THE CRACKS IN

00:41:19.243 --> 00:41:21.078
THE SYSTEM. AND WERE UNDER

00:41:21.145 --> 00:41:22.479
ESTIMATING WHAT THE SCALE OF

00:41:22.546 --> 00:41:25.015
THE PROBLEM AS I JUST MENTIONED

00:41:25.082 --> 00:41:26.517
TWO THINGS WE ARE ALSO RESPOND

00:41:26.584 --> 00:41:28.152

SPECIFICALLY ON ON USED IN A

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:38.662
LOT OF THE GOALS THAT BOTH IN

00:41:38.729 --> 00:41:41.799

BETTER IDENTIFY PROBLEM AND I

00:41:44.869 --> 00:41:46.770
THINK THAT WE WOULD WE FULLY

00:41:46.837 --> 00:41:49.173
AGREE- AND WE'RE WE'RE FINALLY

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:50.274
GETTING STEPPED UP TO BE ABLE

00:41:50.341 --> 00:41:51.075
TO WORK ON SOME OF THOSE ISSUES

00:41:51.141 --> 00:41:54.345
MORE FULLY. SO EAGER AND

00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:45.742
OF THE PROGRAM WHAT WERE OUR

00:45:45.809 --> 00:45:47.711
COMMUNITY SERVICES TO HELP THE

00:45:47.778 --> 00:45:50.647
MENTALLY ILL ON OUR STREETS YOU

00:45:53.317 --> 00:45:55.786
WHAT IS THE GOVERNOR. I ACT I

00:45:55.853 --> 00:45:58.055
MET WITH HIM AFTER THE HE MADE

00:45:58.122 --> 00:45:59.756
HIS PRESENTATION THAT AFTERNOON

00:45:59.823 --> 00:46:01.325
AND I GAVE THEM OUR STUDY ON

00:46:01.391 --> 00:46:05.696
LPS. HIS EYES WENT WIDE OPEN

00:46:05.762 --> 00:46:07.531
AND IN THIS THE STAFF MEMBER

00:46:07.598 --> 00:46:08.966
SAID YOU KNOW WE HAD A CUT HIS

00:46:09.032 --> 00:46:10.601
SPEECH BY AN HOUR BECAUSE YOU

00:46:10.667 --> 00:46:11.735
WANTED TO JUST GIVE A LECTURE

00:46:11.802 --> 00:46:15.606
ON LPS. SO I AM REALLY EXCITED

00:46:15.672 --> 00:46:17.541
THAT HE'S FOCUSED ON IT BUT-

00:46:17.608 --> 00:46:19.843
WHERE IS THE PROGRAM WHERE THE

00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:21.945
IDEAS WERE THE- WORST THE MEAT

00:46:22.012 --> 00:46:24.248
FOR THE BONE SO WE CAN. I THINK

00:46:24.314 --> 00:46:25.749
ADDRESS THE MOST CRITICAL.

00:46:25.816 --> 00:46:27.885
COMPONENT OF OUR OBVIOUS

00:46:27.951 --> 00:46:29.887
HOMELESS PROBLEM. THAT THAT

00:46:29.953 --> 00:46:31.388
THE- THAT THE CONSTITUENTS ARE

00:46:31.455 --> 00:46:33.090
SAYING EVERY DAY WHEN THEY

00:46:33.157 --> 00:46:35.359
DRIVE THEIR CARS THROUGH DOWN.

00:46:35.425 --> 00:46:37.694
AL ALL ALL MENTION I AM OUR OUR

00:46:37.761 --> 00:46:39.496
SISTER AGENCY AND DEPARTMENT TO

00:46:39.563 --> 00:46:40.397
ADD A DEPARTMENT STATE

00:46:40.464 --> 00:46:41.798
HOSPITALS ALSO HAS A PILOT

00:46:41.865 --> 00:46:43.267
SPECIFIC TO SUPPORTING THE

00:46:43.333 --> 00:46:44.568
HOUSING NEEDS OF THOSE WHO ARE

00:46:44.635 --> 00:46:46.603
INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL SO

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:47.204
I. THOUGHT THAT I WOULD DEFER

00:46:47.271 --> 00:46:48.405
TO THEM FOR MORE DETAIL ON THAT

00:46:48.472 --> 00:46:49.806
PROPOSAL IN INITIATIVE BUT I

00:46:49.873 --> 00:46:51.608
THINK. AS CERTAINLY THERE WILL

00:46:51.675 --> 00:46:52.910
BE ADDITIONAL EXPLORATION

00:46:52.976 --> 00:46:54.645
SPECIFICALLY AS IT RELATES TO

00:46:54.711 --> 00:46:56.213
THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE

00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:57.314
DOLLARS AND YOU HEARD THE

00:46:57.381 --> 00:46:58.048

SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS. A NEEDING

00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:01.685
TO ENSURE DOLLARS ARE SPENT IN

00:47:01.752 --> 00:47:02.586
PRIORITIZE AND SO I THINK

00:47:02.653 --> 00:47:04.021
THAT'S A CONTINUED CONVERSATION

00:47:04.087 --> 00:47:05.389
THAT WOULD ONE EXPLORE EXPLORE

00:47:05.455 --> 00:47:07.691
THE LEGISLATURE. TO IDENTIFY

HOW WE NEED TO DO EXACTLY WHAT

00:47:09.693 --> 00:47:11.061

00:47:11.128 --> 00:47:12.629
ARE WE GIVING THE SYSTEM I'M

00:47:12.696 --> 00:47:16.500

IN. WHERE DO WE GO. YEAH I KNOW

00:47:31.782 --> 00:47:32.649
I THINK IT WOULD BE A

00:47:32.716 --> 00:47:34.818
COMBINATION ADDS ADDS THAT THE

00:47:34.885 --> 00:47:36.086
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE

00:47:36.153 --> 00:47:38.855

COLLEGES THERE'S ARE. A

00:50:26.189 --> 00:50:27.724
SPEAKING WITH A STRONGER VOICE

00:50:27.791 --> 00:50:30.394
NOW BUT THE VOICE WE DON'T SEEM

00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:31.027
TO CARE AS MUCH OF IS THE VOICE

00:50:31.094 --> 00:50:33.697
OF SENIORS. AND MY

00:50:33.764 --> 00:50:35.065
UNDERSTANDING IS THE NUMBER OF

00:50:35.132 --> 00:50:35.899
SENIORS WHO HAVE BECOME

00:50:35.966 --> 00:50:37.901
HOMELESS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN

00:50:37.968 --> 00:50:40.337
THEIR LIVES AFTER THE AGE OF

00:50:40.404 --> 00:50:41.271
FIFTY FIVE AND I WOULD ARGUE

00:50:41.338 --> 00:50:42.839
THAT THAT THAT THIS FIFTY FIVE

00:50:42.906 --> 00:50:44.641
SHOULDN'T QUALIFIED AS A SENIOR

00:50:44.708 --> 00:50:46.176
THAT MAKES ME VERY NERVOUS BUT-

00:50:46.243 --> 00:50:49.279
BUT ASSUMING THAT IT IS. I I'M

00:50:49.346 --> 00:50:50.814
WAY OVER THE HILL THEN IF

00:50:50.881 --> 00:50:52.849
THAT'S THE CASE BUT IT USING

00:50:52.916 --> 00:50:54.818
THAT CORPUS FIFTY FIVE YEARS OF

00:50:54.885 --> 00:50:57.721
AGE AND ALL OR- ENTER. IS THAT

00:50:57.788 --> 00:50:59.856
A- WE ARE SEEING THE PEOPLE ARE

00:50:59.923 --> 00:51:01.458
AT THAT AGE GROUP IN ABOVE

00:51:01.525 --> 00:51:03.660
HOMELESS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN

00:51:03.727 --> 00:51:05.362
THEIR LIVES AND NOT BECAUSE OF

00:51:05.429 --> 00:51:06.630
SUBSTANCE ABUSE OR MENTAL

00:51:06.696 --> 00:51:07.764
HEALTH ISSUES BUT BECAUSE THEY

00:51:07.831 --> 00:51:10.333
DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO GET

00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:12.669
OVER THAT TRANSITION IF THEY

00:51:12.736 --> 00:51:15.038
LOSE A ROOMMATE OR- BREADWINNER

00:51:15.105 --> 00:51:17.007
I KNOW THERE'S SOME PROGRAM.

00:51:17.073 --> 00:51:20.710
THIS IS A- A- AN ISSUE THAT HAS

00:51:20.777 --> 00:51:22.579
SOME KIND OF RESOLUTION IT'S

00:51:22.646 --> 00:51:23.914
BEING USED ELSEWHERE AND I

00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:26.483
WONDERED- JUST LISTENING TO NPR

00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:29.386
A FEW WEEKS AGO- THE CITY OF

00:51:29.453 --> 00:51:32.389
CHICAGO HAS A PROGRAM WHERE

00:51:32.456 --> 00:51:33.690
PEOPLE CALL IN AND THEY GO

00:51:33.757 --> 00:51:35.792
THROUGH OF. RELATIVELY GENTLE

00:51:35.859 --> 00:51:38.328
SCREENING PROCESS AND ARE GIVEN

00:51:38.395 --> 00:51:40.831
THE A STIPEND TO HELP THEM GET

00:51:40.897 --> 00:51:42.032
THROUGH THE TIME WE'RE

00:51:42.098 --> 00:51:43.133
OTHERWISE THEY WOULD BE

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:46.570
AFFECTED AND THAT- THE MY

00:51:46.636 --> 00:51:48.772
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. WHEN

00:51:48.839 --> 00:51:49.773
AFTER GIVING UP TO A SEVERAL

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:51.374
MONTHS I THINK IS IN SOME

00:51:51.441 --> 00:51:53.877
INSTANCES BUT THAT THEY NEVER

00:51:53.944 --> 00:51:55.979
HEAR FROM 75% OF THOSE PEOPLE

00:51:56.046 --> 00:51:57.814
AGAIN. IN OTHER WORDS IT

00:51:57.881 --> 00:51:59.716
HAVEN'T WE STABILIZE THEIR

HAVING MANAGE IN THE WINTER I

00:52:12.162 --> 00:52:12.896
WANT TO BE ON THE STREET THERE.

00:52:12.963 --> 00:52:16.700
IN THE WITH. END OF THE- RING

00:52:16.766 --> 00:52:18.101
IF THERE ARE ANY PRO HE- IF

00:52:18.168 --> 00:52:18.969
THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE

00:52:19.035 --> 00:52:20.604
LOOKING AT. AND THEN WHEN IT

00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:23.940
COMES TO PROVIDING- HOME HOMES

00:52:24.007 --> 00:52:25.842

MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION.

00:52:32.849 --> 00:52:34.217

AND- YOU KNOW APPROACH REGIONAL

00:53:26.436 --> 00:53:29.005
STRAIGHT. WOULD OPPOSE ON THE

ALSO MANDATED THAT WE IMPLEMENT

01:44:05.973 --> 01:44:09.309
COORDINATED ENTRY SYSTEMS-

01:44:09.376 --> 01:44:10.777
WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY AN A AND A

01:44:10.844 --> 01:44:12.913
FACT A MORE EFFECTIVE WAY OF

01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:15.115
PRIORITIZING FOLKS FOR HOUSING

APPROPRIATE FOR PEOPLE. AND

01:44:20.053 --> 01:44:21.455
THEN IT ALSO GAVE GUIDANCE ON

01:44:21.521 --> 01:44:23.023
THE MAKE UP OF CONTINUUM OF

01:44:23.090 --> 01:44:25.759
CARE BOARDS SO WHAT TYPES OF

01:44:27.160 --> 01:44:30.063
THE DECISION MAKING. AND IN A

01:44:30.130 --> 01:44:31.665
LOT OF THE RECOMMENDATION WAS

THE REGION- WE CANNOT JUST

01:57:57.904 --> 01:58:02.642
FOCUS ON THE CITY ITSELF. SO IN

01:58:02.708 --> 01:58:04.510
TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN- ARE

01:58:04.577 --> 01:58:05.812
HOMELESS CRISIS REALLY CAME TO

01:58:05.878 --> 01:58:08.047

01:58:12.151 --> 01:58:14.720
UNCHECKED. AND IT GREW TO OVER

01:58:14.787 --> 01:58:16.022
FORTY INDIVIDUALS WHICH FOR

01:58:16.088 --> 01:58:17.590
SOME OF THE FOLKS IN THE ROOM I

01:58:17.657 --> 01:58:18.891
KNOW THAT'S A SMALL NUMBER BUT

01:58:18.958 --> 01:58:20.059
FOR CITY LIKE CAPTAIN MAY THAT

01:58:20.126 --> 01:58:22.528
IS A SERIOUS SERIOUS ISSUE-

01:58:22.595 --> 01:58:24.363
WERE COMPASSIONATE COMMUNITY

01:58:24.430 --> 01:58:25.932
BUT AS THE FIRE STARTED TO

01:58:25.998 --> 01:58:27.834
RACE. CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS

01:58:27.900 --> 01:58:29.669
BECAME CONCERNED ABOUT THE

01:58:29.735 --> 01:58:31.204
SAFETY OF THE PEOPLE LIVING IN

01:58:31.270 --> 01:58:32.371
THE ENCAMPMENTS AS WELL AS

01:58:32.438 --> 01:58:34.640
THEIR OWN SAFETY- THE END

01:58:34.707 --> 01:58:36.809
OBVIOUSLY CRIME HEALTH AND

01:58:36.876 --> 01:58:39.078
SANITATION ISSUES. REALLY MET

01:58:39.145 --> 01:58:40.146
THE CITY AND COUNTY HAD TO STEP

01:58:40.213 --> 01:58:43.749
IN AND DO SOMETHING. OVER EIGHT

01:58:43.816 --> 01:58:45.284
MONTH PERIOD WE EMPLOYED- WE

01:58:45.351 --> 01:58:47.119
BELIEVE FOR ITS PRACTICES MANY

01:58:47.186 --> 01:58:49.121
OF WHICH ARE NOW. OF THE NEW

01:58:49.188 --> 01:58:51.090
POLL COMING OUT OF THE BOISE

01:58:51.157 --> 01:58:55.228
DECISION. AND WE MADE SURE THAT

01:58:55.294 --> 01:58:57.163
WE PROVIDED A LOT OF OUTREACH

01:58:57.230 --> 01:58:58.164
TO THE INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN

01:58:58.231 --> 01:58:59.532
THESE ENCAMPMENTS WE WORKED

01:58:59.599 --> 01:59:00.466
DIRECTLY WITH THEM IN OUR

01:59:00.533 --> 01:59:01.868
SERVICE PROVIDERS. TO

01:59:01.934 --> 01:59:03.569
TRANSITION THEM OUT OF AN

01:59:03.636 --> 01:59:04.670
ENCAMPMENT AS OPPOSED TO

01:59:04.737 --> 01:59:07.740
PUSHING THEM OUT- I THINK THE

01:59:07.807 --> 01:59:08.975
MOST EFFECTIVE THING WE DID IS

01:59:09.041 --> 01:59:09.842
WHAT WE CALLED INTENSIVE

01:59:09.909 --> 01:59:11.077
SERVICE STAYS WE ACTUALLY

01:59:11.143 --> 01:59:12.879
BROUGHT- ON THREE OCCASIONS

PERIOD. WE BROUGHT THE SERVICES

01:59:16.582 --> 01:59:17.817
RIGHT INTO THE IN CAMERA WE SET

01:59:17.884 --> 01:59:19.886
UP TENTS WE BROUGHT IN FOOD.

01:59:19.952 --> 01:59:21.554
ALL THE SERVICES PROVIDE

01:59:21.621 --> 01:59:22.688
SERVICE PROVIDERS CAME FROM

WERE. IN EACH OF THOSE WE FOUND

01:59:27.827 --> 01:59:30.062
TO BE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL

01:59:30.129 --> 01:59:30.930
ACTUALLY TRANSITION IN MANY OF

CAN TESTIFY THAT- IT IS THE

01:59:57.189 --> 01:59:59.792
RIGHT WAY TO APPROACH THIS AND

01:59:59.859 --> 02:00:00.359

BETWEEN BAKERSFIELD FRESNO. AND

02:12:46.191 --> 02:12:48.593
IT'S ABOUT TWENTY FIVE BAD

02:12:48.660 --> 02:12:50.562
SWEAR THEY'RE SERVING IN THE

02:12:50.629 --> 02:12:51.063

THAT AT IN THE CHEST OPEN AT A

02:13:07.379 --> 02:13:08.747
COUPLE YEARS AGO I'M NOT

PEOPLE SHOWED UP FOR THOSE

02:13:15.454 --> 02:13:19.224
TWENTY FIVE BEDS- SO I. DO HAVE

02:13:19.291 --> 02:13:21.326
A LOT OF. CAPITAL IT'S- EXPAND

02:13:21.393 --> 02:13:24.429
THOSE RISKS. BECAUSE IF A KID

02:13:24.496 --> 02:13:25.464
BECOMES HOMELESS AT AGE SIXTEEN

02:13:25.530 --> 02:13:28.066

YOU CAN RAPIDLY RE HOUSE- YOU

02:13:31.236 --> 02:13:32.971

THOSE IN THOSE SLIDES. MONDAY

02:13:39.010 --> 02:13:41.413
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE CHALLENGE

02:13:41.480 --> 02:13:45.283
IS THAT. SO WHEN. I DID IT'S

02:13:45.350 --> 02:13:47.052
PUSHED WHERE THEY WOULDN'T THEY

02:13:47.119 --> 02:13:48.987
WOULDN'T. DO THE LAST POINT OF

02:13:49.054 --> 02:13:50.422

EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE NOT.

02:13:59.698 --> 02:14:01.466
NOT CHRONICALLY HOMELESS

02:14:01.533 --> 02:14:06.471
THANKFULLY THEY DON'T MEET THAT

02:14:06.538 --> 02:14:09.508
DEFINITION. JEFF OLDER UNIT ARE

02:14:09.574 --> 02:14:10.275
THERE IS A LOT OF SUPPORT OF

02:14:10.342 --> 02:14:11.309
HOW DE TO CHRONICALLY HOMELESS

02:14:11.376 --> 02:14:14.913
POPULATIONS TO FIND HOUSING

02:14:14.980 --> 02:14:18.517
THAT YOU QUALIFY FOR THAT IS

02:14:18.583 --> 02:14:20.051
YOU KNOW SERVICE INTENSIVE

02:14:20.118 --> 02:14:22.587

HAVE ACCESS TO SERVICES INSTEAD

02:14:26.558 --> 02:14:28.794

PROGRAM OBVIOUSLY HAS BY YOU IS

02:28:53.090 --> 02:28:55.092
VERY EFFECTIVE IN GIVING PEOPLE

02:28:55.159 --> 02:29:00.064
SHORT TERM FIX BUT WAS NOT

02:29:00.131 --> 02:29:01.432
REALLY PREVENTING PEOPLE FROM

02:29:01.499 --> 02:29:03.067
BECAUSE HOME YES. IN FACT THE

02:29:03.134 --> 02:29:05.703
VAST THE PEOPLE WHO ARE FIXING

02:29:05.770 --> 02:29:07.438
AFFECTION OR REPORT DURING

02:29:07.505 --> 02:29:10.875
BUSINESS WILL NEVER BE HOMELESS.

02:29:10.941 --> 02:29:13.544
TURN ANY PENSION RAM IS

02:29:13.611 --> 02:29:15.346
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IN CREATING

02:29:15.413 --> 02:29:17.381
AN EFFICIENT STRATEGY BUT IT'S

02:29:17.448 --> 02:29:20.217
EXTREMELY TRICKY. A RECENT UCLA

02:29:20.284 --> 02:29:22.286
POLICY LAB AND UNIVERSITY OF

02:29:22.353 --> 02:29:24.822
CHICAGO POVERTY LAB TO STUDY

02:29:24.889 --> 02:29:28.893
pINCLUDE PREVIOUS EPISODES OF

02:29:28.959 --> 02:29:31.796
HOMELESSNESS AND SHARP SURPRISE

02:29:31.862 --> 02:29:35.466
BIKES AND- COUNTY SERVICES-

02:29:35.533 --> 02:29:37.201
USAGE SIX MONTHS PRIOR. THE

02:29:37.268 --> 02:29:39.570
PERSON'S REPORTING THAT THE- TO

02:29:39.637 --> 02:29:42.840
STAY. FOR THOSE EXPERIENCING

02:29:42.907 --> 02:29:43.841
HOMELESSNESS FOR THE FIRST

02:29:43.908 --> 02:29:45.876
TIME. THE STATE SHOULD ENSURE

02:29:45.943 --> 02:29:47.178
PREVENTION PROGRAMS ARE

02:29:47.244 --> 02:29:50.981
TARGETED TO THOSE AT THE

02:29:51.048 --> 02:29:51.482
HIGHEST RISK OF BECOMING

02:29:51.549 --> 02:29:52.616
HOMELESS DOES AND THAT WOULD BE

02:29:52.683 --> 02:29:55.453
BASED. ON PREDICT- ALGORITHM

02:29:55.519 --> 02:29:57.755
OUR PANEL TAKES DATA. AND

02:29:57.822 --> 02:29:58.889
PREVENTING RETURNS TO

02:29:58.956 --> 02:30:00.891
HOMELESSNESS IS ALSO CRITICAL

02:30:00.958 --> 02:30:03.894
STRATEGY A NUMBER OF- OF

02:30:03.961 --> 02:30:05.896
HOUSEHOLDS WITH PREVIOUS

02:30:05.963 --> 02:30:07.198
EPISODES OF HOMELESSNESS WHO

02:30:07.264 --> 02:30:09.033
HAD RECEIVED TEMPORARY RENTAL

02:30:09.100 --> 02:30:11.602
ASSISTANCE. SUCH AS RAPID RE

02:30:11.669 --> 02:30:14.372
HOUSING ONLY- FACE HOMELESSNESS

02:30:14.438 --> 02:30:16.307
ONCE THEIR SUBSIDY ENDED AND

02:30:16.374 --> 02:30:18.042
ONE CRITICAL STRATEGY AS CHRIS

02:30:18.109 --> 02:30:20.611
MARTIN MENTIONED COULD BE TO

02:30:20.678 --> 02:30:22.079
TRY AND MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF

02:30:22.146 --> 02:30:23.647
OUR STATE FUNDED AFFORDABLE

02:30:23.714 --> 02:30:26.550
HOUSING PROGRAMS. HAVE A SET

02:30:26.617 --> 02:30:28.052
ASIDE FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING

02:30:28.119 --> 02:30:29.787
HOMELESSNESS SO THAT THOSE

02:30:29.854 --> 02:30:31.522
HOUSEHOLDS ONCE THEIR RENTAL

02:30:31.589 --> 02:30:32.890
THEIR RAPID RE HOUSING ENDS

02:30:32.957 --> 02:30:34.325
THERE'S RENTAL ASSISTANCE

02:30:34.392 --> 02:30:36.293
SUBSIDY ENDS THEY DON'T FALL

02:30:36.360 --> 02:30:38.963
BACK AND THOMAS SAYS THAT WOULD

02:30:39.029 --> 02:30:43.134
BE A CRITICAL. PREVENTION

02:30:43.200 --> 02:30:44.268
STRATEGY. ONE WAY BERKSHIRE

02:30:44.335 --> 02:30:45.469
PREVENT WOULD BE TO STATE FOR

02:30:45.536 --> 02:30:46.303
OF HOUSING AS I MENTION

02:30:46.370 --> 02:30:48.773
SERVICES HOMELESS BENEFICIARIES

02:30:48.839 --> 02:30:50.441
AND ANOTHER WOULD BE TO DEVELOP

02:30:50.508 --> 02:30:52.910
PROGRAM- PROTOCOLS TO PREVENT

02:30:52.977 --> 02:30:54.512
PEOPLE FROM DISCHARGING FROM

02:30:54.578 --> 02:30:56.247
STATE FUNDED INSTITUTIONAL

02:30:56.313 --> 02:30:58.149
SETTINGS AND A HOMELESSNESS.

02:30:58.215 --> 02:30:59.950
FROM HOSPITALS AND NURSING

02:31:00.017 --> 02:31:01.385
HOMES FROM SUBSTANCE USE

02:31:01.452 --> 02:31:02.386
RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT

02:31:02.453 --> 02:31:04.922
FACILITIES FROM PRISONS AND

02:31:04.989 --> 02:31:06.323
JAILS AND FROM FOSTER CARE.

02:31:06.390 --> 02:31:08.192
DISCHARGED INNING SHOULD TAKE

02:31:08.259 --> 02:31:11.028
HOUSING INTO ACCOUNT. AND

02:31:11.095 --> 02:31:12.963
INCLUDE HOUSING NAVIGATION AND

02:31:13.030 --> 02:31:15.032
SUBSIDIES FOR PEOPLE HAVE WHO

02:31:15.099 --> 02:31:15.900
HAVE NOWHERE TO GO UPON

02:31:15.966 --> 02:31:19.236
DISCHARGE. FINALLY I WOULD URGE

02:31:19.303 --> 02:31:20.204
THAT ANY FUNDING SPENT ON

02:31:20.271 --> 02:31:22.473
PREVENTION SEPARATE AND APART

02:31:22.540 --> 02:31:24.742
FROM ANY PROGRAM DESIGNED TO

02:31:24.809 --> 02:31:26.577
RESOLVE PEOPLE'S HOMELESSNESS

02:31:26.644 --> 02:31:28.512
SIMPLY BECAUSE IT IS A LOT

02:31:28.579 --> 02:31:31.549
EASIER TO SERVE SOMEBODY WHO'S

02:31:31.615 --> 02:31:32.216
STILL HOUSE THAN IT IS TO SERVE

02:31:32.283 --> 02:31:33.984
SOMEBODY WHO'S ON THE STREETS.

02:31:34.051 --> 02:31:37.488
AND SO I WENT ON A CD- THE

02:31:37.555 --> 02:31:38.756
LATTER. TRANING THE STORE OF

02:31:38.823 --> 02:31:41.125
THE FORMER STRATEGY TO GET

02:31:41.192 --> 02:31:43.294
PEOPLE OFF OF THE STREETS AND

02:31:43.360 --> 02:31:45.763
INTO HOMES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH

02:31:45.830 --> 02:31:47.231

FOR YOUTH A STATEWIDE ADVOCACY

02:32:14.425 --> 02:32:14.892
GROUP THAT'S BASED HERE IN

02:32:14.959 --> 02:32:18.162
SACRAMENTO. FIRST I'D LIKE TO

02:32:18.229 --> 02:32:19.363
SAY I'VE I'VE BEEN IN SOCIAL

02:32:19.430 --> 02:32:20.564
WORK AND I'VE BEEN A SOCIAL

WORK PRACTITIONER FOR ALMOST

02:32:21.899 --> 02:32:23.267
TWENTY YEARS. AND THIS IS THE

02:32:23.334 --> 02:32:25.035
MOST ATTENTION I'VE EVER SEEN

02:32:25.102 --> 02:32:26.237
TO THE ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS IN

02:32:26.303 --> 02:32:28.806
GENERAL- BUT SPECIFICALLY YOU

02:32:28.873 --> 02:32:30.641
HOMELESSNESS. AND I'M JUST

02:32:30.708 --> 02:32:31.942

SPEAK ABOUT THIS AND APPRECIATE

02:32:35.112 --> 02:32:36.247
YOUR ATTENTION. BUT

02:32:36.313 --> 02:32:37.715
PARTICULARLY TO THE ISSUE OF

02:32:37.781 --> 02:32:39.083
YOUTH HOMELESSNESS WHICH IS

02:32:39.149 --> 02:32:41.819
WHAT ALL ALL TALK ABOUT TODAY.

02:32:41.886 --> 02:32:42.853
ALL ALL SHARE A COUPLE OF

02:32:42.920 --> 02:32:45.656
COMPELLING REASONS WHY A FOCUS

02:32:45.723 --> 02:32:47.358
ON HOMELESS YOUNG PEOPLE IS

02:32:47.424 --> 02:32:49.193
EXTREMELY CRITICAL. AND BRIFLY

02:32:49.260 --> 02:32:50.895
DISCUSS WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE

02:32:50.961 --> 02:32:52.796
GROUND FOR US- AS PRACTITIONERS

02:32:52.863 --> 02:32:55.399
IN THE FIELD. THE FIRST OUR

02:32:55.466 --> 02:32:57.768
FIRST VERY COMPELLING REASON.

02:32:57.835 --> 02:33:00.571
IS THAT- MANY CHRONICALLY

02:33:00.638 --> 02:33:03.007
HOMELESS ADULTS HAD THEIR FIRST

02:33:03.073 --> 02:33:05.476
HOMELESS EXPERIENCE BETWEEN THE

02:33:05.543 --> 02:33:06.911
AGES OF EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR.

02:33:06.977 --> 02:33:10.581
AND WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT

02:33:10.648 --> 02:33:11.048
HOMELESSNESS DURING AN

02:33:11.115 --> 02:33:14.118
ADULTHOOD. LEADS TO FUTURE

02:33:14.184 --> 02:33:17.321
HOMELESSNESS LATER IN LIFE. I

02:33:17.388 --> 02:33:18.155
THE RECENT STUDIES HAVE TOLD US

02:33:18.222 --> 02:33:20.824
THAT ANYWHERE FROM A QUARTER

02:33:20.891 --> 02:33:22.860
250% OF CHRONICALLY HOMELESS

02:33:22.927 --> 02:33:23.861
ADULTS REPORTED THEIR FIRST

02:33:23.928 --> 02:33:25.763
HOMELESS EXPERIENCE DURING THE

02:33:25.829 --> 02:33:27.798
TRANSITION AG TEARS. THAT'S

02:33:27.865 --> 02:33:29.833
REALLY SIGNIFICANT- IF SOMEBODY

02:33:29.900 --> 02:33:33.904
BROUGHT YOU A- A SORT OF AT AT

02:33:33.971 --> 02:33:35.873
INTERVENTION RIGHT NOW THAT

02:33:35.940 --> 02:33:36.607
COULD CUT CHRONICALLY

02:33:36.674 --> 02:33:39.977
HOMELESSNESS. BY 25250% TODAY-

02:33:40.044 --> 02:33:41.879
I THINK WE ALL JUMP ON THAT

02:33:41.946 --> 02:33:44.214
RIGHT AND YOUNG PEOPLE FOCUSING

02:33:44.281 --> 02:33:46.116
ON YOUNG PEOPLE WILL ABSOLUTELY

02:33:46.183 --> 02:33:52.189
DO THAT. AND OUR OUR OUR

02:33:52.256 --> 02:33:54.858
INVESTMENT DURING THIS TIME

02:33:54.925 --> 02:33:57.595
ALSO IN TRANSITION AG OF ITS X.

02:33:57.661 --> 02:34:00.898
SURE ROUTINELY CRITICAL AND IT

02:34:00.965 --> 02:34:04.668
CAN BE. AIRY LASTING FOR THIS

02:34:04.735 --> 02:34:06.770
POPULATION ADOLESCENCE IS

02:34:06.837 --> 02:34:08.072
ACTUALLY THE SECOND MOST

02:34:08.138 --> 02:34:09.173
PROFOUND PERIOD OF BRAIN

02:34:09.239 --> 02:34:12.076
DEVELOPMENT SECOND ONLY TO THE

02:34:12.142 --> 02:34:14.612
ZERO FIVE YEARS. THIS IS

02:34:14.678 --> 02:34:15.245
IMPORTANT TO US WE THINK ABOUT

02:34:15.312 --> 02:34:17.915
INVESTMENTS BECAUSE WHAT WE CAN

02:34:17.982 --> 02:34:19.783
DO WITH YOUNG PEOPLE CAN GO

02:34:19.850 --> 02:34:21.318
VERY FAR TO CREATING BEHAVIOR

02:34:21.385 --> 02:34:23.454
CHANGE AMONG THIS GROUP-

02:34:23.520 --> 02:34:25.122
INTERVENTIONS THAT FOCUS ON

02:34:25.189 --> 02:34:26.690
SELF REGULATION- THAT IS

02:34:26.757 --> 02:34:28.292
EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING WHICH IS

02:34:28.359 --> 02:34:29.627
REALLY THE FOUNDATION FOR

02:34:29.693 --> 02:34:31.762
LIFELONG FUNCTIONING. OUR

02:34:31.829 --> 02:34:33.130
PROVEN TO BE EFFECTIVE AND

02:34:33.197 --> 02:34:34.965
THESE CRITICAL UC'S SKILLS ARE

02:34:35.032 --> 02:34:36.066
EXTREMELY RESPONSIVE TO

02:34:36.133 --> 02:34:38.268
INTERVENTION. ADDITIONALLY

02:34:38.335 --> 02:34:40.504
INTERVENTIONS THAT HELP AT

02:34:40.571 --> 02:34:42.006
YOUNG PEOPLE FOCUS ON

02:34:42.072 --> 02:34:43.073
DEVELOPING AND MOANED AND

02:34:43.140 --> 02:34:45.376
MAINTAINING ROBUST. SOCIAL

02:34:45.442 --> 02:34:47.011
SUPPORT HELP THEM INCREASE

02:34:47.077 --> 02:34:49.079
THEIR OWN SOCIAL CAPITAL. THAT

02:34:49.146 --> 02:34:51.515
CAPITAL PERSISTS LONG AFTER OUR

02:34:51.582 --> 02:34:53.517
PROGRAMS AND SERVICES ARE GONE.

02:34:53.584 --> 02:34:54.351
AND WE'VE HEARD FOLKS TODAY

02:34:54.418 --> 02:34:56.887
TALK ABOUT THE SAFETY NET- WHEN

02:34:56.954 --> 02:34:58.989
WE THINK THEIR RELATIONSHIPS

02:34:59.056 --> 02:35:01.625
AND SOCIAL CAPITAL HUMANS ARE

02:35:01.692 --> 02:35:03.761
NATURAL SAFETY NETS AND WE

02:35:03.827 --> 02:35:05.929
THINK ABOUT FOLKS WHO ARE NOT

02:35:05.996 --> 02:35:07.498
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WHO

02:35:07.564 --> 02:35:09.099
ARE NOT EXPERIENCING SYSTEMS

02:35:09.166 --> 02:35:10.834
WHO HAVE NOT HAD. THAT

02:35:10.901 --> 02:35:12.069
TRAUMATIC OR ADVERSE LIFE

02:35:12.136 --> 02:35:13.604
EXPERIENCES AND THEY'RE STILL

02:35:13.671 --> 02:35:16.073
RELIANT ON THEIR PARENTS OR

02:35:16.140 --> 02:35:19.243
OTHER FAMILY UNTIL THE AGE OF

02:35:19.309 --> 02:35:20.144
TWENTY SIX AT LEAST. THAT'S THE

02:35:20.210 --> 02:35:22.713
NEW AVERAGE SO WHEN WE EXPECT

02:35:22.780 --> 02:35:25.015
YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THESE

02:35:25.082 --> 02:35:27.184
VERY SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCES TO

02:35:27.251 --> 02:35:30.654
OPERATE WITHOUT SERVICES THAT

02:35:30.721 --> 02:35:32.990
FOCUS ON THEIR ABILITY TO SET

02:35:33.057 --> 02:35:36.894
GOALS. REDUCE BASS MANAGE. AT

02:35:36.960 --> 02:35:39.830
WORK WE'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT IN

02:35:39.897 --> 02:35:40.731
AND SERVING THIS GROUP OF YOUNG

02:35:40.798 --> 02:35:43.667
PEOPLE SO FOCUSING SUPPORT FOR

02:35:43.734 --> 02:35:45.235
YOUNG PEOPLE ON THESE CRITICAL

02:35:45.302 --> 02:35:46.704
SKILL DEVELOPMENT AREAS IS

02:35:46.770 --> 02:35:51.275
ESSENTIAL. I WE ALSO KNOW WHEN

02:35:51.341 --> 02:35:52.743
I AND I THINK RIGHT NOW IS THE

02:35:52.810 --> 02:35:54.912
TIME TO REITERATE THAT- HOUSING

02:35:54.978 --> 02:35:56.080
FIRST AS DOES NOT MEAN HOUSING

02:35:56.146 --> 02:35:58.816
ONLY. AND THAT IS ESPECIALLY

02:35:58.882 --> 02:36:00.017
IMPORTANT FOR THIS POPULATION I

02:36:00.084 --> 02:36:03.053
AND- HOW PROVIDING HOUSING

02:36:03.120 --> 02:36:05.055
ACCESS TO BASIC NEEDS CERTAINLY

02:36:05.122 --> 02:36:06.790
REDUCES STRESS SO THAT YOUNG

02:36:06.857 --> 02:36:08.025
PEOPLE CAN BEGAN TO USE THEIR

02:36:08.092 --> 02:36:09.727
BRAINS. I'M MOR EFFECTIVELY

02:36:09.793 --> 02:36:12.196
AND EFFICIENTLY TO SET GOALS

02:36:12.262 --> 02:36:13.864
AND ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS I AM

02:36:13.931 --> 02:36:15.799
BUT THEY ALSO NEED HUMANS THAT

02:36:15.866 --> 02:36:17.501
HELP THEM DO THAT. AND SO IT'S

02:36:17.568 --> 02:36:19.002
VERY IMPORTANT THAT OUR

02:36:19.069 --> 02:36:21.505
INVESTMENTS ARE STRATEGICALLY.

02:36:21.572 --> 02:36:23.407
FOCUSED ON INTERVENTIONS THAT

02:36:23.474 --> 02:36:26.076
HAVE TO DO WITH MENTAL HEALTH-

02:36:26.143 --> 02:36:27.945
THAT HAVE TO DO WITH- HIGHER

02:36:28.011 --> 02:36:29.780
LEVELS OF CASE MANAGEMENT- SO

02:36:29.847 --> 02:36:32.316
THIS MEANS THAT PROVIDERS NEED

02:36:32.382 --> 02:36:33.851
TO PAY QUALIFIED STAFF MEMBERS

02:36:33.917 --> 02:36:36.386
TRAIN NO STAFF MEMBERS AND

02:36:36.453 --> 02:36:37.888
PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

02:36:37.955 --> 02:36:38.956
AND- BETTER OFF MEMBERS

02:36:39.022 --> 02:36:40.224
UNDERSTAND BRAIN PAINTS.

02:36:40.290 --> 02:36:42.993
UNDERSTAND HE'S EVIDENCE BASED

02:36:43.060 --> 02:36:45.629
INTERVENTIONS. I'M AND LAST I

02:36:45.696 --> 02:36:47.464
THINK. I THINK IT MAKES SENSE

02:36:47.531 --> 02:36:48.999
TO SAY THAT INVESTING IN YOUNG

02:36:49.066 --> 02:36:50.567
PEOPLE WILL SAVE US MONEY IN

02:36:50.634 --> 02:36:53.537
THE LONG RUN- LA'S ECONOMIC

02:36:53.604 --> 02:36:55.606
ROUND TABLE- TOLD US IN A

02:36:55.672 --> 02:36:57.775
RECENT REPORT THAT THAT COST OF

02:36:57.841 --> 02:36:58.909
THESE INTERVENTIONS-

02:36:58.976 --> 02:37:00.344
PARTICULARLY ONES THAT ARE

02:37:00.410 --> 02:37:01.745
ADEQUATELY TARGETED TO THE

02:37:01.812 --> 02:37:03.514
RIGHT INDIVIDUALS. RESULTS AND

02:37:03.580 --> 02:37:04.748
AVOIDED PUBLIC COSTS THAT WILL

02:37:04.815 --> 02:37:06.283
MORE THAN OFFSET THE COST OF

02:37:06.350 --> 02:37:08.819
THOSE INTERVENTIONS. I HOMELESS

02:37:08.886 --> 02:37:09.753
YOUTH GO ON TO USE PUBLIC

02:37:09.820 --> 02:37:11.889
RESOURCES SUCH AS MEDICAL AND

02:37:11.955 --> 02:37:13.590
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THEY ARE

02:37:13.657 --> 02:37:14.491
MORE LIKELY TO BECOME

02:37:14.558 --> 02:37:16.693
INCARCERATED- THEY HAVE A

02:37:16.760 --> 02:37:18.228
CONTINUED NEED FOR HOUSING IN

02:37:18.295 --> 02:37:19.830
SUPPORT OF SERVICE SAYS. AT THE

02:37:19.897 --> 02:37:21.832
USE CASH EIGHT MORE FREQUENTLY

02:37:21.899 --> 02:37:23.901
CHILD CARE FOOD STAMPS ON THOSE

02:37:23.967 --> 02:37:26.804
THINGS ARE ALL VERY EXPENSIVE.

02:37:26.870 --> 02:37:27.905
IF WE DIVERT THESE YOUNG PEOPLE

02:37:27.971 --> 02:37:28.972
FROM A LIFE OF CHRONIC

02:37:29.039 --> 02:37:30.908
HOMELESSNESS INTO THRIVING

02:37:30.974 --> 02:37:32.142
TRAJECTORIES NOT ONLY DO YOU

02:37:32.209 --> 02:37:33.777
SAVE MONEY ON POTENTIAL

02:37:33.844 --> 02:37:35.946
INTERVENTIONS. BUT WE REALIZED

02:37:36.013 --> 02:37:39.016
THAT. TO ALL AND ECONOMIC

02:37:39.082 --> 02:37:43.720
CONTRIBUTIONS THEY HAVE THE

02:37:43.787 --> 02:37:44.288
OPPORTUNITY TO CONTRIBUTE.

02:37:44.354 --> 02:37:45.722
NUMBER THREE THROUGH THEIR LAST

02:37:45.789 --> 02:37:47.157
CREATE OPTIMAL. FOR THE FUTURE.

02:37:47.224 --> 02:37:50.694
AND THIS IS. BREAKING THE CYCLE.

02:37:50.761 --> 02:37:52.062
FURTHER THERE'S BEEN A HISTORIC

02:37:52.129 --> 02:37:53.130
UNDER INVESTMENT IN THIS

02:37:53.197 --> 02:37:55.899
POPULATION AND WE KNOW SO MUCH

02:37:55.966 --> 02:37:57.801
MORE NOW ABOUT WHAT WORKS ON

02:37:57.868 --> 02:37:59.970
AND MANY REGIONS ARE PREPARED

02:38:00.037 --> 02:38:01.839
TODAY TO DEPLOY APPROPRIATE

02:38:01.905 --> 02:38:03.240
SERVICE SAYS- THROUGH

02:38:03.307 --> 02:38:04.942
COORDINATED SYSTEMS LEVELS

02:38:05.008 --> 02:38:08.078
APPROACHES NOW- SO ON THE

02:38:08.145 --> 02:38:10.447
GROUND AND YEAH WE AT THE YMCA

02:38:10.514 --> 02:38:13.217
IN SAN DIEGO SERVE. ALMOST TWO

02:38:13.283 --> 02:38:14.718
HUNDRED AND FIFTY YOUNG PEOPLE

02:38:14.785 --> 02:38:16.086
AND HOUSING ANNUALLY AND THOSE

02:38:16.153 --> 02:38:18.021
ARE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ARE.

02:38:18.088 --> 02:38:19.289
ACTED IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM

02:38:19.356 --> 02:38:20.791
OR EVEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO

02:38:20.858 --> 02:38:22.492
SYSTEMS INVOLVEMENT SO WE ARE

02:38:22.559 --> 02:38:25.429
INTIMATELY I'M AWARE OF THE

02:38:25.495 --> 02:38:27.698
BARRIERS THAT THEY FACE AND THE

02:38:27.764 --> 02:38:30.133
CHALLENGES THAT HAVE ONE OF THE

02:38:30.200 --> 02:38:31.301
THINGS THAT WE BELIEVE IS

02:38:31.368 --> 02:38:33.303
WORKING THUS FAR. IS THAT

02:38:33.370 --> 02:38:35.205
PARTICULARLY EVIDENCED AND KEEP

02:38:35.272 --> 02:38:37.507
AND HAPPY AND THAT IS AT THE

02:38:37.574 --> 02:38:39.376
COORDINATED APPROACH THAT'S

02:38:39.443 --> 02:38:41.879
REQUIRED AT A REGIONAL LEVEL SO

02:38:41.945 --> 02:38:43.914
THAT FLEXIBILITY I THINK IS A

02:38:43.981 --> 02:38:45.315
FOURTEEN COMMUNITIES. TO

02:38:45.382 --> 02:38:48.285
IDENTIFY THE GAPS IN SERVICES

02:38:48.352 --> 02:38:50.721
THE POPULATIONS OF FOCUS ON AND

02:38:50.787 --> 02:38:53.257
OBVIOUSLY- AND AT THE CAPACITY

02:38:53.323 --> 02:38:55.492
BUILDING THAT IT THAT THAT'S

02:38:55.559 --> 02:38:57.895
POSSIBLE WITH WITHOUT FUNDING.

02:38:57.961 --> 02:39:00.330
I'M AND I THINK ON THE GROUND

02:39:00.397 --> 02:39:02.466
RIGHT NOW ALL WE ARE BUILDING A

02:39:02.532 --> 02:39:04.334
AN EFFECTIVE COORDINATED

02:39:04.401 --> 02:39:06.403
APPROACH TO AND HOMELESSNESS

02:39:06.470 --> 02:39:09.239
FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND- WITH TEN

02:39:09.306 --> 02:39:12.242
FUNDING. AND FURTHER EVALUATION

LIFE SENTENCE OF DYSFUNCTION WE

02:45:27.117 --> 02:45:29.786
MUST REMOVE BARRIERS THAT MAKE

02:45:29.853 --> 02:45:32.222
ACCESSING CARE POSSIBLE WE NEED

02:45:32.289 --> 02:45:34.524

02:45:39.095 --> 02:45:41.831
INCLUDE TRAINING PROFESSIONALS

TO ENSURE THAT CARE IS

02:45:57.447 --> 02:45:59.449
ACCESSIBLE WE NEED TO FOCUS ON

02:45:59.516 --> 02:46:03.019
EARLY PSYCHOSIS IDENTIFICATION

02:46:03.086 --> 02:46:04.688
AND SCALE THAT PRACTICE UP

02:46:04.754 --> 02:46:07.157
ACROSS THE STATE. WE NEED TO

02:46:07.223 --> 02:46:08.925
GET SERIOUS ABOUT INCREASING

02:46:08.992 --> 02:46:12.529
THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE.

02:46:12.595 --> 02:46:15.932
ACROSS THE STATE AND WE MUST

02:46:15.999 --> 02:46:17.834
SEE TO IT THAT THERE REALLY IS

02:46:17.901 --> 02:46:20.870
TRUE PARITY IN BOTH THE PRIVATE

02:46:20.937 --> 02:46:22.906
AND PUBLIC SECTORS AS IT

02:46:22.972 --> 02:46:25.975
RELATES TO PROVIDING ONGOING

02:46:26.042 --> 02:46:27.277
CARE TO THOSE WHO LIVE WITH A

02:46:27.344 --> 02:46:29.679
MENTAL ILLNESS. AND OR IS

02:46:29.746 --> 02:46:32.349
SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER JUST AS

02:46:32.415 --> 02:46:34.451
WE DO FOR PHYSICAL HEALTH. WE

02:46:34.517 --> 02:46:37.020
ALSO REALLY NEED TO GET SERIOUS

02:46:37.087 --> 02:46:38.154
ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH IN THE

02:46:38.221 --> 02:46:41.825
WORKPLACE. WE NEED TO LEARN HOW

02:46:41.891 --> 02:46:43.426
TO ACCOMMODATE PEOPLE WHO LIVE

02:46:43.493 --> 02:46:46.029
WITH A MENTAL ILLNESS IN OUR

02:46:46.096 --> 02:46:48.965
PLACES OF EMPLOYMENT BECAUSE SO

02:46:49.032 --> 02:46:52.869
MANY FOLKS ARE UNABLE TO THRIVE

02:46:52.936 --> 02:46:55.505
IN THEIR WORKPLACE BECAUSE WE

02:46:55.572 --> 02:46:57.640
JUST NEED AS EMPLOYERS TO BE

02:46:57.707 --> 02:47:00.176
EDUCATED ABOUT HOW WE A CALM.

02:47:00.243 --> 02:47:02.679
THESE FOLKS AND IF THEY'RE NOT

02:47:02.746 --> 02:47:03.980
A COMMON NEEDED AND THEY'RE

02:47:04.047 --> 02:47:06.716
NOT- THRIVING THAN THEY OFTEN

02:47:06.783 --> 02:47:09.986
LOSE THEIR JOB. LOSING THEIR

02:47:10.053 --> 02:47:11.054
EMPLOYMENT LEAD TO HOMELESSNESS

02:47:11.121 --> 02:47:13.890
SO LET'S REALLY START THINKING

02:47:13.957 --> 02:47:16.059
ABOUT THAT. AND AS HAS BEEN

02:47:16.126 --> 02:47:17.560
MENTIONED ALREADY WE NEED TO

02:47:17.627 --> 02:47:19.729
SCALE UP WHOLE PERSON CARE IT'S

02:47:19.796 --> 02:47:22.866
THE IT WORKS AND WE KNOW IT

02:47:22.932 --> 02:47:24.634
WORKS AND WE ALSO NEED TO SEE

02:47:24.701 --> 02:47:27.504
HOUSING AS A VITAL COMPONENT OF

02:47:27.570 --> 02:47:30.340
THAT CARE IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE

02:47:30.407 --> 02:47:31.841
FOR SOMEONE WITH A MENTAL

02:47:31.908 --> 02:47:34.911
ILLNESS TO STABILIZE WHILE

02:47:34.978 --> 02:47:37.714
LIVING. ON THE STREETS WE-

THOUGHT THAT DOCTORS SHOULD BE

02:47:45.588 --> 02:47:47.624
ABLE TO WRITE A PRESCRIPTION

02:47:47.690 --> 02:47:50.860

THREE YEARS. AND THEN ON THAT

02:54:17.747 --> 02:54:18.881
IT'S REPLICATED ACROSS THE

02:54:18.948 --> 02:54:20.116
STATE IN OTHER COMMUNITIES AND

02:54:20.183 --> 02:54:21.918
THIS IS REALLY IMPACTING OUR

02:54:54.617 --> 02:54:56.886

COLOR- AND I THINK IT'S ALSO

02:55:18.674 --> 02:55:19.208
IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT THE

02:55:19.275 --> 02:55:20.009
SERVICES BEING PROVIDED TO THEM

02:55:20.076 --> 02:55:20.543
ARE DEVELOPMENTALLY

02:55:20.610 --> 02:55:22.545
APPROPRIATE. AND EMBODY A

02:55:22.612 --> 02:55:23.980
POSITIVE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT

02:55:24.046 --> 02:55:25.481
MODELS THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH

02:55:25.548 --> 02:55:26.616

02:55:31.487 --> 02:55:33.189
INTERVENTION FOR SOME OF THESE

02:55:33.256 --> 02:55:34.757
YET THEY HAVE NO PLACE TO GO

02:55:34.824 --> 02:55:36.659
HOME TO. AND SO I KNOW A LOT OF

02:55:36.726 --> 02:55:37.627
FOLKS WHO HAVE CHILDREN OF

02:55:37.693 --> 02:55:38.961

ENVIRONMENTS AND SO. IT'S

02:55:44.867 --> 02:55:46.369

IS AVAILABLE FOR THEM AND NOT

02:55:47.970 --> 02:55:49.238
MUCH OF A SAFETY NET. AND SO

LAST COUPLE YEARS BY THIS
