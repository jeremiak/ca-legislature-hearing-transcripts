VERSION OF THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS

00:37:52.136 --> 00:37:53.604
GOING TO BE AMENDED INTO THE

THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

00:38:06.384 --> 00:38:08.352
WHICH ONE IS IT.

00:38:08.419 --> 00:38:09.820
I BELIEVE THERE WAS AN

00:38:09.887 --> 00:38:11.589
UNDERSTANDING THAT WAS REACHED

00:38:11.656 --> 00:38:15.292

THE AUTHOR -- IT DESCRIBE THAT

00:38:20.998 --> 00:38:22.166
IF THAT MAKES SENSE.

00:38:22.233 --> 00:38:25.436
I I HAVE THE LANGUAGE THAT I

00:38:25.503 --> 00:38:28.139

THAT YET IF YOU MAYBE YOU THINK

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:37.848
WHAT'S THE DISTRIBUTED PART.

00:38:37.915 --> 00:38:39.283
MAYBE WHAT I SHOULD JUST AS READ

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:40.451

00:38:40.518 --> 00:38:43.187
SENTENCE AND AND IT'S IN THE SUB

OF SECTION TWO OF THE BILL.

00:38:46.323 --> 00:38:49.360
AND IT ELIMINATES THE SECOND

SEXY THE SECOND SET SENS IN THAT

00:38:52.063 --> 00:38:52.630

TO SECTION TWO OF THE BILL.

I'VE GOT THREE POINTS THAT I'D

00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:01.465
LIKE TO MAKE.

00:40:01.532 --> 00:40:02.767
FIRST I WANT TO ADDRESS THE

00:40:02.833 --> 00:40:04.368
ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM -- I DON'T

00:40:04.435 --> 00:40:05.870
BELIEVE THAT SECTION TWO OF THE

00:40:05.936 --> 00:40:07.204
BILL IS ABOUT HOMEOWNERS I DON'T

00:40:07.271 --> 00:40:08.038
BELIEVE IT'S ABOUT HOMEOWNERS

00:40:08.105 --> 00:40:09.607
ASSOCIATIONS I DON'T BELIEVE

00:40:09.673 --> 00:40:10.841
IT'S ABOUT BUILDERS.

00:40:10.908 --> 00:40:12.276
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MY

00:40:12.343 --> 00:40:13.744
COLLEAGUE MISTER ENTRY AREA I

00:40:13.811 --> 00:40:14.879
BELIEVE IT'S ABOUT.

00:40:14.945 --> 00:40:16.046
PLAINTIFFS LAWYERS WANTING TO

00:40:16.113 --> 00:40:17.782
MAKE IT EASIER TO GET THESE

00:40:17.848 --> 00:40:19.784
CASES INTO LITIGATION BECAUSE

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:21.685
THAT'S HOW THEY MAKE THEIR MONEY.

00:40:21.752 --> 00:40:22.453
AS THE COMMITTEE KNOWS THE

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:23.888
CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HAS

00:40:23.954 --> 00:40:26.323
THOUGHT LONG AND HARD ABOT HOW

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:28.125
TO CURB CONSTRUCTION DEFECT

00:40:28.192 --> 00:40:29.627
LITIGATION OVER THE YEARS.

00:40:29.693 --> 00:40:31.595
AND THE ENACTMENT OF SB EIGHT

00:40:31.662 --> 00:40:32.930
HUNDRED WAS ONE OF THOSE EFFORTS.

00:40:32.997 --> 00:40:34.265
WHAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE YEARS

00:40:34.331 --> 00:40:36.133
IS THAT IT HASN'T HAD THE EFFECT

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:37.535
THAT EVERYBODY INTENDED?

00:40:37.601 --> 00:40:39.737
AND THE PROBLEM IS WHEN REPAIRS

00:40:39.804 --> 00:40:41.138
ARE ACTUATED PLAINTIFFS

00:40:41.205 --> 00:40:42.273
CONSTRUCTION DEFECT LAWYERS

00:40:42.339 --> 00:40:43.707
DON'T MAKE ANY MONEY.

00:40:43.774 --> 00:40:45.009
THEY WORK ON A CONTINGENCY FEE

00:40:45.075 --> 00:40:47.278
BASIS AND THEY ONLY MAKE MONEY

00:40:47.344 --> 00:40:48.379
IF THESE CASES GOING TO

00:40:48.445 --> 00:40:49.413
LITIGATION AND THERE'S A CASH

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:51.649
SETTLEMENT.

00:40:51.715 --> 00:40:53.884
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

00:40:53.951 --> 00:40:57.955
THE A THE SECOND POINT I WANT TO

00:40:58.022 --> 00:41:00.424
MAKE IS THAT VOTING PROVISIONS

00:41:00.491 --> 00:41:02.226
SUCH AS THESE HAVE BEEN AROUND

00:41:02.293 --> 00:41:03.327
pFOR DECADES.

00:41:03.394 --> 00:41:04.829
AND THEY'RE ENTIRELY CONSISTENT

00:41:04.895 --> 00:41:06.630
WITH EXISTING LAW IN FACT LAST

00:41:06.697 --> 00:41:07.698
YEAR THE CALIFORNIA COURT OF

00:41:07.765 --> 00:41:09.133
APPEAL IN THE BRANCHES CASE

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:11.035
CONSIDERED THE EXACT VOTING

00:41:11.101 --> 00:41:13.838
PROVISION THAT SECTION TWO OF

00:41:13.904 --> 00:41:15.706
THIS BILL SEEKS TO ABOUT.

00:41:15.773 --> 00:41:16.307
H. O. A. LAWYERS IN THAT CASE

00:41:16.373 --> 00:41:18.008
MADE ALL THE SAME ARGUMENTS THAT

00:41:18.075 --> 00:41:19.910
THE PROPONENTS OF SECTION TWO OF

00:41:19.977 --> 00:41:21.545
THIS BILL ARE MAKING HERE.

00:41:21.612 --> 00:41:22.780
AND THE COURT REJECTED THOSE

00:41:22.847 --> 00:41:25.049
ARGUMENTS THE COURT FOUND THAT

00:41:25.115 --> 00:41:26.951
THE PUBLIC POLICY UNDERLYING

00:41:27.017 --> 00:41:28.419
HOMEOWNER INTERESTS AND

00:41:28.485 --> 00:41:29.453
HOMEOWNERRIGHTS.

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:30.921
AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF

00:41:30.988 --> 00:41:32.523
CONSTRUCTION DEFECT LITIGATION

00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:33.724
JUSTIFIED THESE VOTING

00:41:33.791 --> 00:41:35.593
REQUIREMENTS THE COURT WENT ON

00:41:35.659 --> 00:41:36.927
TO ADD THAT THE MINIMAL

00:41:36.994 --> 00:41:38.863
INCONVENIENCE TO AN H. O. WAY OF

00:41:38.929 --> 00:41:40.397
HAVING TO CONDUCT A VOTE BEFORE

00:41:40.464 --> 00:41:41.232
EMBARKING.

00:41:41.298 --> 00:41:43.667
ON WHAT IS A HUGE STEP IN FILING

00:41:43.734 --> 00:41:45.636
A CONSTRUCTION DEFECT LAWSUIT IS

00:41:45.703 --> 00:41:47.438
OUTWEIGHED BY THE BENEFITS THAT

00:41:47.504 --> 00:41:50.808
IS A FORTY TO THE HOMEOWNERS OF

00:41:50.875 --> 00:41:53.043
THESE VOTING REQUIREMENTS.

00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:53.677
AND THAT TAKES IN MY THIRD POINT

00:41:53.744 --> 00:41:54.578
THIS REALLY IS ABOUT THE

00:41:54.645 --> 00:41:55.946

PRIMARY UNIT.

00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:15.539
THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE IN THE

00:51:15.605 --> 00:51:18.108
FACT THAT A HOMEOWNER CAN EXPAND

00:51:18.175 --> 00:51:19.342

THE OPTION OPPOSITION WILL SAY

00:51:44.568 --> 00:51:45.902
AND I WANT TO ADDRESS THIS THAT

00:51:45.969 --> 00:51:47.204
WE SHOULD WAIT FOR THE STUDY ON

00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:49.339
THE GRAYSON LEGISLATION THAT IS

00:51:49.406 --> 00:51:51.608
DUE LATER ON THIS MONTH.

00:51:51.675 --> 00:51:52.709
BUT I'VE CALLED -- THE HOUSING

COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND THEY

00:51:54.411 --> 00:51:55.579
HAVE TOLD ME.

00:51:55.645 --> 00:51:57.681
THAT EIGHTY USE ARE NOT WITHIN

00:51:57.747 --> 00:51:59.449
THE SCOPE OF THE SURVEY SO EVEN

00:51:59.516 --> 00:52:00.417
IF THEY ARE YOU HAVE MY

00:52:00.484 --> 00:52:01.918
COMMITMENT I'VE TALKED TO THE

00:52:01.985 --> 00:52:04.254
CHAIR -- AND THE OTHER EIGHTY

00:52:04.321 --> 00:52:05.489
YOU BILLS THAT ARE PROGRESSING

00:52:05.555 --> 00:52:08.225
IN THE THE LEGISLATURE THAT WE

00:52:08.291 --> 00:52:10.093
LOOK FOR A RECONCILIATION AND IF

00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:11.561
THERE'S IS LANGUAGE IN THERE

00:52:11.628 --> 00:52:14.731
WHICH I DON'T EXPECT THAT I WILL.

00:52:14.798 --> 00:52:16.299
I WILL YOU KNOW -- COOPERATE

00:52:16.366 --> 00:52:17.901
WITH A RECONCILIATION OF THOSE

00:52:17.968 --> 00:52:21.071

00:52:21.137 --> 00:52:22.572
ASSISTANCE.

00:52:22.639 --> 00:52:23.473
ANOTHER ELEMENT OF THIS BILL IS

00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:23.940
THAT.

00:52:24.007 --> 00:52:25.575
SB THIRTEEN PROHIBITS OWNER

00:52:25.642 --> 00:52:27.210
OCCUPANCY ORDINANCES WHICH

00:52:27.277 --> 00:52:28.745
REQUIRED THAT THE OWNER LIVE

00:52:28.812 --> 00:52:30.547
EITHER ON THE EIGHTY YOU OR IN

00:52:30.614 --> 00:52:31.648
THE PRIMARY UNIT.

00:52:31.715 --> 00:52:32.983
BUT THERE'S THIS UNFOUNDED FEAR

00:52:33.049 --> 00:52:35.018
THAT INVESTORS ARE BUYING HOUSES

00:52:35.085 --> 00:52:37.087
JUST TO BUILD EIGHTY USED TO

00:52:37.153 --> 00:52:37.888
RENT THEM OUT.

00:52:37.954 --> 00:52:40.056
AND IN REALITY STUDIES HAVE

00:52:40.123 --> 00:52:41.124

TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY USE.

00:52:50.166 --> 00:52:52.903
AND FOUND THAT ONLY 10% OF THEM

00:52:52.969 --> 00:52:54.371
WERE BUILT BY INVESTORS.

00:52:54.437 --> 00:52:56.039
OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIRES

00:52:56.106 --> 00:52:57.407
REQUIREMENTS LIMIT THE MARKET

00:52:57.474 --> 00:52:59.009
BILL DVD USE AND PREVENTS THE

00:52:59.075 --> 00:53:01.411
CONSTRUCTIONS OF THEM THE BANKS

00:53:01.478 --> 00:53:03.880
OPPOSE THE OWNER OCCUPANCY

00:53:03.947 --> 00:53:05.115
BECAUSE IF THE HOUSE GOES INTO

00:53:05.181 --> 00:53:06.750
FORECLOSURE THEY DON'T HAVE ANY

00:53:06.816 --> 00:53:09.252
MECHANISM TO TAKE OCCUPANCY IN

00:53:09.319 --> 00:53:12.289
ORDER TO OWN THE HOUSE -- DO WE

00:53:12.355 --> 00:53:13.857
WE DEVELOP REAL PROPERTY LOSS

00:53:13.924 --> 00:53:15.525
THAT WE HAVE TRANSFER BUILDING

00:53:15.592 --> 00:53:17.794
IT'S EASY IT'S WE WANT TO HAVE

00:53:17.861 --> 00:53:19.262

00:53:19.329 --> 00:53:20.497
THE TRANSFER ABILITY OF PROPERTY.

00:53:20.564 --> 00:53:22.165
THERE'S NO OTHER TYPE OF

00:53:22.232 --> 00:53:24.234
RESIDENTIAL UNITS THAT HAVE

00:53:24.301 --> 00:53:26.136
RESTRICTIONS ON ON OUR OCCUPANCY

HELPING TO MOVE EIGHTY USED TO

THEIR MANY ASPECTS OF THIS BILL

01:03:50.993 --> 01:03:51.627
THAT I THINK ARE VERY NON

CONTROVERSIAL.

01:03:52.762 --> 01:03:54.597

AS I THINK WE ALL KNOW THERE IS

01:04:02.838 --> 01:04:03.539
ONE MAJOR ISSUE IN THIS BILL

01:04:03.606 --> 01:04:04.040
THAT.

01:04:04.106 --> 01:04:05.308

THAT IS AROUND FEES -- AND LET

01:04:07.643 --> 01:04:10.012

WHICH IS I HAVE PUBLICLY STATED

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:14.116
THAT I DO THINK WE NEED TO DO

01:04:14.183 --> 01:04:15.351
SIGNIFICANTLY REFORM ACROSS THE

01:04:15.418 --> 01:04:17.420

01:04:25.394 --> 01:04:26.929
PROPOSED IN THIS BILL AROUND

01:04:26.996 --> 01:04:29.265

EXACT LEE RIGHT FORMULA -- I

01:04:31.867 --> 01:04:32.401
THINK THEIR NUMBER POTENTIAL

01:04:32.468 --> 01:04:33.636
NUANCES THAT WE MIGHT WANT TO

01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:35.037
CREATE AND THINK ABOUT DEPENDING

01:04:35.104 --> 01:04:37.106
ON THE DISTRICTS DEPENDING ON

01:04:37.173 --> 01:04:38.574
THE TYPES OF JURISDICTION --

01:04:38.641 --> 01:04:41.410
WHETHER 25% IS THE RIGHT NUMBER

01:04:41.477 --> 01:04:44.113
MAYBE IT SHOULD BE LARGER -- BUT

01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:46.382

01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:19.395
MOST OF THESE ARE LESS THAN

FIFTY UNITS SO IT'S NOT A BIG

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:22.832

01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:19.341
EVERY.

01:11:19.408 --> 01:11:22.077
OPPOSED CHANGE IN THE LAW IN

01:11:22.144 --> 01:11:23.846
THIS BILL.

01:11:23.912 --> 01:11:25.748
IS BASED UPON.

01:11:25.814 --> 01:11:27.349
A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF

01:11:27.416 --> 01:11:28.350
COMPLAINTS THAT THE CENTER

01:11:28.417 --> 01:11:30.152
RECEIVED FROM ALL AROUND THE

FIXES. FOR THESE COMPLAINTS.

01:11:43.866 --> 01:11:48.237

01:12:00.015 --> 01:12:01.450
ORIGIN.

01:12:01.517 --> 01:12:03.018

BUT WANT TO NOTE THAT THIS BILL

01:13:03.145 --> 01:13:04.646

REGULAR BASIS THEIR FAIR THEIR

01:13:24.099 --> 01:13:25.901
TRANSPARENT WE HAVE ONE OF THE

01:13:25.968 --> 01:13:27.069

BOTH SECTIONS OF THE CODE.

01:13:43.185 --> 01:13:43.986
SB TWELVE SIXTY FIVE WAS NEARBY

01:13:44.052 --> 01:13:44.920

TODAY'S LAW.

01:14:20.122 --> 01:14:21.523

IT THE ASSOCIATION HAS THE

01:14:47.015 --> 01:14:49.418
BURDEN TO PROVE THAT A MISTAKE

01:14:49.484 --> 01:14:51.453
THAT MIGHT HAVE OCCURRED DID NOT

01:15:14.443 --> 01:15:15.510
DAYS.

01:15:15.577 --> 01:15:16.345
THE OTHER ISSUE WITH THE BILL IS

01:15:16.411 --> 01:15:18.380
THAT IT COVERS THE ELECTION

01:15:18.447 --> 01:15:19.982

NEXT GOES TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

01:38:14.188 --> 01:38:17.558
AND I'VE MET WITH THE LOCAL

01:38:17.625 --> 01:38:19.927
GOVERNMENT CHAIR AND THEIR STAFF

01:38:19.994 --> 01:38:22.796
SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THE HOUSING

01:38:22.863 --> 01:38:24.632
COMMITTEE STAFF IN THE LOCAL

01:38:24.698 --> 01:38:26.333
GOVERNMENT STAFF WORK TOGETHER.

01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:29.603
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BILL WHEN

01:38:29.670 --> 01:38:32.573
IT -- KNOCK ON WOOD GETS OUT OF

01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:33.874
THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE

01:38:33.941 --> 01:38:37.177
IT REFLECTS -- BOTH THE

01:38:37.244 --> 01:38:39.313
COMMITMENTS I'VE ADE HERE AND

01:38:39.380 --> 01:38:40.281
THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE IN THE

01:38:40.347 --> 01:38:42.416
ANALYSIS HERE AND THE ONES I

01:38:42.483 --> 01:38:44.184
WILL BE DESCRIBING BUT BEFORE I

01:38:44.251 --> 01:38:46.086
DESCRIBE THOSE I WOULD LIKE TO

01:38:46.153 --> 01:38:47.354
JUST SAY.

01:38:47.421 --> 01:38:49.256
WHAT THIS BILL DOES BECAUSE

01:38:49.323 --> 01:38:50.724
THERE'S A LOT OF MYTHS OUT THERE?

01:38:50.791 --> 01:38:54.528
AND THIS BILL IS.

01:38:54.595 --> 01:38:56.697
HAS REALLY DESIGNED ON A VERY

01:38:56.764 --> 01:38:59.500
SIMPLE PREMISE.

01:38:59.566 --> 01:39:03.070
THAT IS IF WE WE'VE ALL ACCEPTED

01:39:03.137 --> 01:39:04.538
THAT WE ARE IN A HOUSING CRISIS

01:39:04.605 --> 01:39:06.540
CALIFORNIA NEITHER HAS ENOUGH

01:39:06.607 --> 01:39:07.107
HOUSING.

01:39:07.174 --> 01:39:08.575
NOR.

01:39:08.642 --> 01:39:11.312
AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO THOSE ARE

01:39:11.378 --> 01:39:13.747
TWO REALITIES.

01:39:13.814 --> 01:39:17.184
AND YET WHEN WE LOOK AT EACH OF

01:39:17.251 --> 01:39:19.720
OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THEY HAVE

01:39:19.787 --> 01:39:22.556
IN THEIR EXISTING GENERAL PLANS

01:39:22.623 --> 01:39:24.224
ZONING RULES ALL.

01:39:24.291 --> 01:39:26.760
THEY HAVE MORE HOUSING THAT IS

01:39:26.827 --> 01:39:31.031
BEEN ALLOWED ON ON PAPER RIGHT

01:39:31.098 --> 01:39:33.600
IN THEIR DOCUMENTS THEN AS YOU

01:39:33.667 --> 01:39:35.602
HAVE BEEN BUILT.

01:39:35.669 --> 01:39:36.170
SO.

01:39:36.236 --> 01:39:38.172
WHAT I THOUGHT ABOUT IS IF WE'RE

01:39:38.238 --> 01:39:39.606
IN A CRISIS?

01:39:39.673 --> 01:39:42.242
AND WE WANT FAST ACTION.

01:39:42.309 --> 01:39:44.044
THEN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO

01:39:44.111 --> 01:39:46.980
GET FAST ACTION IS TO HELP LOCAL

01:39:47.047 --> 01:39:49.383
GOVERNMENTS TO DO THAT WHICH

01:39:49.450 --> 01:39:50.851
THEY ARE ALREADY DOING.

01:39:50.918 --> 01:39:52.252
AND JUST DO IT WITH A LITTLE

01:39:52.319 --> 01:39:53.921
MORE EFFICIENCY AND MORE

01:39:53.987 --> 01:39:56.123
CERTAINTY.

01:39:56.190 --> 01:39:57.391
SO THIS BILL IS.

01:39:57.458 --> 01:40:00.561
BASICALLY RESPECTS LOCAL ZONING.

01:40:00.627 --> 01:40:03.597
IT SAYS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. FOR

01:40:03.664 --> 01:40:06.200
THOSE HOUSING APPLICATIONS THAT

01:40:06.266 --> 01:40:10.237
MEET YOUR EXISTING RULES.

01:40:10.304 --> 01:40:13.006
ONCE THE APPLICANT HAS PROVIDED

01:40:13.073 --> 01:40:14.942
YOU ALL THE INFORMATION YOU

01:40:15.008 --> 01:40:16.377
REQUIRE AND THE BILL.

01:40:16.443 --> 01:40:18.045
LISTS THE TYPE OF INFORMATION

01:40:18.112 --> 01:40:19.480
THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED THAT IS

01:40:19.546 --> 01:40:21.181
TYPICALLY CONSIDERED A COMPLETE

01:40:21.248 --> 01:40:22.850
APPLICATION.

01:40:22.916 --> 01:40:25.018
AND SO LET'S SAY I'M THE HOUSING

01:40:25.085 --> 01:40:26.453
APPLICANT AND I SUBMIT SOMETHING

01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:28.389
BUT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT LOOKS

01:40:28.455 --> 01:40:29.523
AT IT AND SAYS YOU KNOW WE NEED

01:40:29.590 --> 01:40:31.358
A IN A STRUCTURAL ENGINEER

01:40:31.425 --> 01:40:33.594
ANALYSIS HERE WE CAN'T ANALYZE

01:40:33.660 --> 01:40:33.927
THIS.

01:40:33.994 --> 01:40:35.362
UNTIL WE HAVE -- SOME

01:40:35.429 --> 01:40:37.030
INFORMATION FROM A STRUCTURAL

01:40:37.097 --> 01:40:38.999
ENGINEER OR WE CAN ANALYZE THIS

01:40:39.066 --> 01:40:41.101
YET UNTIL IT HAS YOU KNOW THIS

01:40:41.168 --> 01:40:42.736
INFORMATION OR THAT INFORMATION

01:40:42.803 --> 01:40:44.505
SO ONCE I HAVE.

01:40:44.571 --> 01:40:45.672
GIVEN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ALL

01:40:45.739 --> 01:40:47.207
THE INFORMATION THAT THEY'VE

01:40:47.274 --> 01:40:48.409
REQUIRED ME I'M THE HOUSING

01:40:48.475 --> 01:40:50.010
APPLIQUE KIT.

01:40:50.077 --> 01:40:51.745
AND MY IN THAT THING OF THAT I

01:40:51.812 --> 01:40:53.914
AM SUBMITTING MY APPLICATION FOR

01:40:53.981 --> 01:40:54.882
MEETS.

01:40:54.948 --> 01:40:56.216
THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ZONING

01:40:56.283 --> 01:40:57.117
RULES.

01:40:57.184 --> 01:40:58.786
THEN AT THAT POINT THIS IS WHAT

01:40:58.852 --> 01:41:02.089
THE BILL DOES AT THAT POINT.

01:41:02.156 --> 01:41:03.824
FEES ARE LOCKED.

01:41:03.891 --> 01:41:05.392
IN THE RULES ARE LOCKED SO THEN

01:41:05.459 --> 01:41:06.960
IT GIVES ME THE APPLICANT THE

01:41:07.027 --> 01:41:07.961
CERTAINTY.

01:41:08.028 --> 01:41:09.830
THAT.

01:41:09.897 --> 01:41:11.698
THINGS I'M NOT GOING TO BE IN

01:41:11.765 --> 01:41:13.734
THE SHIFTING LANDSCAPE SO I CAN

01:41:13.801 --> 01:41:16.203
GET THE FINANCING FOR MY PROJECT

01:41:16.270 --> 01:41:17.838
OR FIVE ALREADY SECURED IT.

01:41:17.905 --> 01:41:20.107
I CAN HAVE THE ASSURANCE THAT

01:41:20.174 --> 01:41:22.109
IT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE AND

01:41:22.176 --> 01:41:23.677
WHILE CONSTRUCTION COSTS MIGHT

01:41:23.744 --> 01:41:26.747
GO UP AT LEAST THE FEES FROM

01:41:26.814 --> 01:41:29.383
THIS CITY THAT'S I'VE APPLIED TO

01:41:29.450 --> 01:41:30.317
THOSE WILL PULL UP.

01:41:30.384 --> 01:41:31.785
IN THEIR DESIGN REVIEW STANDARDS

01:41:31.852 --> 01:41:33.854
WHICH I'VE ALREADY UNDERSTAND

01:41:33.921 --> 01:41:35.322
AND I'VE ALREADY MET THOSE WON'T

01:41:35.389 --> 01:41:37.491
CHANGE SO THAT'S THE SIMPLE

01:41:37.558 --> 01:41:38.859
PREMISE.

01:41:38.926 --> 01:41:40.894
AND IT WAS BASED SANTA ROSA

01:41:40.961 --> 01:41:42.696
AFTER THE COFFEE FIRE SO IN THE

01:41:42.763 --> 01:41:45.232
COFFEE FIRE THE EXPERIENCED.

01:41:45.299 --> 01:41:46.533
VERY SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF UNITS

01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:48.168
OVER A THOUSAND HOUSING UNITS

01:41:48.235 --> 01:41:49.837
WERE LOST.

01:41:49.903 --> 01:41:51.638
IN THE REALIZED THEY NEEDED TO

01:41:51.705 --> 01:41:52.806
HELP.

01:41:52.873 --> 01:41:54.174
THEIR RESIDENTS GET THOSE

01:41:54.241 --> 01:41:56.443
HOUSING UNITS BACK FAST AND

01:41:56.510 --> 01:41:57.344
EFFICIENTLY.

01:41:57.411 --> 01:41:59.546
SO THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA

01:41:59.613 --> 01:42:03.417
BASICALLY SPED UP THEIR PROCESS

01:42:03.484 --> 01:42:04.418
HE STREAMLINED THERE.

01:42:04.485 --> 01:42:07.187
THE THE PERMITTING PROCESS SO

01:42:07.254 --> 01:42:10.023
AND GAVE SOME CERTAINTY TO THE

01:42:10.090 --> 01:42:11.825
APPLICANTS TO GET THOSE UNITS

01:42:11.892 --> 01:42:16.497
BACK AND MY STAFF WATCHING THAT

01:42:16.563 --> 01:42:18.499
I ASKED MY STAFF.

01:42:18.565 --> 01:42:19.132
IT WAS MORE THAN A YEAR AGO TO

01:42:19.199 --> 01:42:20.234
CALL SANTA ROSA PLANNING

01:42:20.300 --> 01:42:21.168
DEPARTMENT.

01:42:21.235 --> 01:42:23.570
AND GET THERE I'M TO GET THE

01:42:23.637 --> 01:42:24.505
ORDINANCE IS TO GET THE

01:42:24.571 --> 01:42:26.940
MATERIALS THAT THEY DID WE BASED

01:42:27.007 --> 01:42:28.342
THIS LAW.

01:42:28.408 --> 01:42:31.278
ON WHAT SANTA ROSA DID TO

01:42:31.345 --> 01:42:33.380
RESPOND TO A CRISIS WHICH IS WHY

01:42:33.447 --> 01:42:35.015
WE CALL IT THE HOUSING CRISIS

01:42:35.082 --> 01:42:36.049
ACT.

01:42:36.116 --> 01:42:37.985
NOW THE BILL WHEN IT WAS FIRST

01:42:38.051 --> 01:42:39.019
INTRODUCED MUCH OF THE

01:42:39.086 --> 01:42:41.088
OPPOSITION IS BASED ON THE BILL

01:42:41.154 --> 01:42:43.557
WHEN IT WAS FIRST INTRODUCED.

01:42:43.624 --> 01:42:45.425
THE BILL HAS BEEN GREATLY

01:42:45.492 --> 01:42:47.928
MODIFIED SINCE THEN SIGNIFICANT

01:42:47.995 --> 01:42:49.830
AMOUNT OF AMENDMENTS THIS IS A

01:42:49.897 --> 01:42:51.431
LIST OF ALL THE WAYS THE BILL

01:42:51.498 --> 01:42:52.933
HAS BEEN AMENDED SINCE IT WAS

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.301
FIRST INTRODUCED.

01:42:54.368 --> 01:42:56.069
SO WHILE THERE ARE OPPONENTS

01:42:56.136 --> 01:42:57.838
HERE I THINK IF THEY WERE TO

01:42:57.905 --> 01:42:59.740
READ THE BILL TODAY AND

01:42:59.806 --> 01:43:01.141
ESPECIALLY THE BILL.

01:43:01.208 --> 01:43:04.545
ONCE THE IT HAS THE AMENDMENTS

01:43:04.611 --> 01:43:05.546
THAT I'M TAKING.

01:43:05.612 --> 01:43:06.914
THE BETTER IN YOUR ANALYSIS

01:43:06.980 --> 01:43:08.115
BEFORE YOU.

01:43:08.181 --> 01:43:09.883
AND ADDITIONALLY.

01:43:09.950 --> 01:43:12.319
I AM SO NO LET ME BACK UP SO MY

01:43:12.386 --> 01:43:13.720
PURPOSE WAS TO GIVE THAT

01:43:13.787 --> 01:43:15.589
CERTAINTY TO ALLOW LOCAL

01:43:15.656 --> 01:43:16.390
GOVERNMENTS TO DO WHAT THEY'RE

01:43:16.456 --> 01:43:17.391
ALREADY DOING.

01:43:17.457 --> 01:43:18.358
AND WHEN WE COMES TO

01:43:18.425 --> 01:43:19.593
AFFORDABILITY A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:43:19.660 --> 01:43:23.730
SAY WELL BUT IT DOESN'T DO

01:43:23.797 --> 01:43:24.398
ANYTHING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

01:43:24.464 --> 01:43:26.667
THE FACT IS THAT.

01:43:26.733 --> 01:43:28.135
OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS VERY

01:43:28.201 --> 01:43:31.338
FREQUENTLY FINANCE AFFORDABLE

01:43:31.405 --> 01:43:33.941
HOUSING THROUGH THE IN LIEU FEES

01:43:34.007 --> 01:43:36.143
AND OTHER FEES IMPACT FEES THAT

01:43:36.209 --> 01:43:37.844
THEY GET FROM THE MARKET RATE

01:43:37.911 --> 01:43:38.946
HOUSING.

01:43:39.012 --> 01:43:41.081
THIS DOES NOT REQUIRE A LOCAL

01:43:41.148 --> 01:43:42.883
GOVERNMENT TO DO MORE MARKET

01:43:42.950 --> 01:43:43.884
RATE HOUSING THAN THEY WOULD

01:43:43.951 --> 01:43:46.887
ALREADY HAVE SAID YES.

01:43:46.954 --> 01:43:48.689
TO BUT IT ALLOWS THEM TO DO IT A

01:43:48.755 --> 01:43:50.257
LITTLE MORE EFFICIENTLY.

01:43:50.324 --> 01:43:52.559
AND THEN THEY GET THAT REVENUE

01:43:52.626 --> 01:43:54.361
TO HELP THEM DO THE AFFORDABLE

01:43:54.428 --> 01:43:55.262
HOUSING.

01:43:55.329 --> 01:43:56.496
AND ADDITIONALLY OF COURSE IN

01:43:56.563 --> 01:43:58.065
THE BUDGET WE JUST APPROVED WE

01:43:58.131 --> 01:44:00.200
JUST GAVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT

01:44:00.267 --> 01:44:02.035
OF MONEY TOWARDS AFFORDABLE

01:44:02.102 --> 01:44:05.072
HOUSING BUT LET ME GO FURTHER.

01:44:05.138 --> 01:44:09.242
I'M SOMEONE WHO KNEW MY HISTORY.

01:44:09.309 --> 01:44:11.144
IT WILL REVEAL TOO MUCH ABOUT MY

01:44:11.211 --> 01:44:14.481
AGE BUT I WAS INVOLVED IN THE

01:44:14.548 --> 01:44:15.616
WRITING OF BERKELEY'S RENT

01:44:15.682 --> 01:44:17.117
CONTROL ORDINANCES IN THE

01:44:17.184 --> 01:44:18.118
SEVENTIES.

01:44:18.185 --> 01:44:20.253
I WAS INVOLVED IN THE NINETEEN

01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:21.822
SEVENTY FIVE THE NINETEEN

01:44:21.888 --> 01:44:23.323
SEVENTY SEVEN AND THE NINETEEN

01:44:23.390 --> 01:44:24.725
SEVENTY NINE THE NINETEEN EIGHTY

01:44:24.791 --> 01:44:26.426
ONE THE NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO IN

01:44:26.493 --> 01:44:27.828
THE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR

01:44:27.894 --> 01:44:29.329
BERKELEY RENT CONTROL ORDINANCES.

01:44:29.396 --> 01:44:32.032
I HAVE A VERY SIGNIFICANT AND

01:44:32.099 --> 01:44:33.867
LONG HISTORY WITH RENT CONTROL I

01:44:33.934 --> 01:44:35.669
AM ONE OF THE FEW.

01:44:35.736 --> 01:44:39.473
LEGISLATORS WHO SUPPORTED PROP.

01:44:39.539 --> 01:44:41.308
TEN WHICH I REALIZE IS AN

01:44:41.375 --> 01:44:42.743
ANATHEMA TO MANY PEOPLE.

01:44:42.809 --> 01:44:44.911
AND I STILL SUPPORT RENT CONTROL

01:44:44.978 --> 01:44:46.980
AND I STILL WANT THERE TO BE

01:44:47.047 --> 01:44:48.715
EVICTION PROTECTIONS AND OTHER

01:44:48.782 --> 01:44:50.684
PROTECTIONS FOR OUR TENANTS OF

01:44:50.751 --> 01:44:52.019
EVERY SORT.

01:44:52.085 --> 01:44:54.855
BUT RENT CONTROL IS NOT ENOUGH

01:44:54.921 --> 01:44:56.590
MY OWN COMMUNITY BERKELEY HAS

01:44:56.657 --> 01:44:58.125
HAD RENT CONTROL AS I JUST

01:44:58.191 --> 01:45:00.160
DESCRIBED TO YOU SINCE THAT TIME

01:45:00.227 --> 01:45:01.395
NO CERTAINLY THERE'S BEEN LOTS

01:45:01.461 --> 01:45:02.796
OF STATE LAWS THAT HAVE.

01:45:02.863 --> 01:45:04.531
INHIBITED SOME OF THE INTENTIONS

01:45:04.598 --> 01:45:05.832
OF BERKELEY'S ORIGINAL RENT

01:45:05.899 --> 01:45:08.068
CONTROL BUT RENT CONTROL DOES

01:45:08.135 --> 01:45:11.104
NOT ADDRESS THE SUPPLY CRISIS SO

01:45:11.171 --> 01:45:14.641
WHILE WE MUST PROTECT LOW INCOME

01:45:14.708 --> 01:45:15.976
TENANTS AND I AM A VERY STRONG

01:45:16.043 --> 01:45:17.277
ADVOCATE FOR PROTECTING LOW

01:45:17.344 --> 01:45:18.445
INCOME TENANTS.

01:45:18.512 --> 01:45:19.479
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THIS BILL

01:45:19.546 --> 01:45:21.081
YOU'LL SEE.

01:45:21.148 --> 01:45:22.516
THAT THIS BILL CONTAINS

01:45:22.582 --> 01:45:24.351
PROTECTIONS FOR LOW INCOME TO

01:45:24.418 --> 01:45:27.654
TENANTS SO THAT IF THERE'S ANY

01:45:27.721 --> 01:45:29.423
PROPOSAL TO DEMOLISH AND

01:45:29.489 --> 01:45:30.590
AFFORDABLE UNITS.

01:45:30.657 --> 01:45:32.392
THAT OCCURSDURING THE FIVE

01:45:32.459 --> 01:45:33.593
YEARS THAT THIS BILL IS IN

01:45:33.660 --> 01:45:36.196
EFFECT IN THIS BILL ONLY HAS.

01:45:36.263 --> 01:45:38.131
PROVISIONS FOR FIVE YEARS IT

01:45:38.198 --> 01:45:40.567
SUNSETS IN FIVE YEARS BUT THOSE

01:45:40.634 --> 01:45:43.003
TENET PROTECTIONS ARE THAT IF

01:45:43.070 --> 01:45:44.604
FOR ANY REASON A LOCAL

01:45:44.671 --> 01:45:45.906
GOVERNMENT WERE TO APPROVE A

01:45:45.972 --> 01:45:47.274
DEMOLITION AND I'M NOT

01:45:47.340 --> 01:45:48.975
ADVOCATING THAT THEY EVER DO.

01:45:49.042 --> 01:45:51.478
BUT IF THEY WERE TO THEN AND IT

01:45:51.545 --> 01:45:52.779
WAS A LOW INCOME UNITS.

01:45:52.846 --> 01:45:54.514
THEN IT WOULD HAVE TO BE

01:45:54.581 --> 01:45:56.583
GUARANTEED TO REPLACE AT LEAST

01:45:56.650 --> 01:45:57.718
THAT MANY LOW INCOME UNITS THE

01:45:57.784 --> 01:45:59.886
TENANTS IMPACTED WOULD HAVE TO

01:45:59.953 --> 01:46:01.354
BE RELOCATED.

01:46:01.421 --> 01:46:03.590
AND THEIR RELOCATION EXPENSES

01:46:03.657 --> 01:46:04.791
PAID.

01:46:04.858 --> 01:46:07.627
FOR AND THE A GUARANTEE THAT

01:46:07.694 --> 01:46:09.896
THEY HAVE OUR FIRST RIGHT ON THE

01:46:09.963 --> 01:46:12.332
UNITS THAT REPLACE AT THE SAME

01:46:12.399 --> 01:46:15.068
RENT SO THERE IS STRONG STRONG

01:46:15.135 --> 01:46:17.170
PROTECTIONS. FOR LOW INCOME

01:46:17.237 --> 01:46:19.673
TENANTS IN THIS BILL.

01:46:19.740 --> 01:46:21.308
BUT AGAIN WHAT IS THIS BILL

01:46:21.374 --> 01:46:25.979
TRYING TO DO IT'S TRYING TO HELP

01:46:26.046 --> 01:46:27.314
US.

01:46:27.380 --> 01:46:28.648
GET THE HOUSING THAT OUR LOCAL

01:46:28.715 --> 01:46:29.416
GOVERNMENTS HAVE ALREADY

01:46:29.483 --> 01:46:30.283
APPROVED BUT TO DO IT

01:46:30.350 --> 01:46:31.418
EFFECTIVELY.

01:46:31.485 --> 01:46:33.887
AND EFFICIENTLY TO RESPOND TO

01:46:33.954 --> 01:46:35.889
THIS HOUSING CRISIS THAT WE ARE

01:46:35.956 --> 01:46:38.091
IN NOW I MENTIONED THAT I WILL

01:46:38.158 --> 01:46:39.993
TAKE ALL OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT

01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:41.628
ARE LISTED IN THE ANALYSIS.

01:46:41.695 --> 01:46:44.064
I AM ALSO COMMITTED TO FULLY

01:46:44.131 --> 01:46:47.300
DELETING THE SECTIONS ON PARKING.

01:46:47.367 --> 01:46:48.034
NOW.

01:46:48.101 --> 01:46:49.770
THAT ONE JUST FOR PEOPLE TO

01:46:49.836 --> 01:46:51.972
UNDERSTAND WHY DID I PUT THAT IN

01:46:52.038 --> 01:46:53.540
THE BILL AND LET ME AND WHEN I

01:46:53.607 --> 01:46:54.608
SAY HI.

01:46:54.674 --> 01:46:56.476
THIS BILL IS MY BILL THIS IS A

01:46:56.543 --> 01:46:59.780
BILL THAT MY STAFF AND I CRAFTED

01:46:59.846 --> 01:47:01.615
YES WE HAVE SUPPORTERS YES WE

01:47:01.681 --> 01:47:03.183
HAVE SPONSORS BUT WE CRAFTED

01:47:03.250 --> 01:47:04.618
THIS BILL AND WE CRAFTED IT

01:47:04.684 --> 01:47:07.354
BASED ON SANTA ROSA'S ACTION.

01:47:07.420 --> 01:47:09.122
BUT THE REASON THAT WE INCLUDED

01:47:09.189 --> 01:47:10.457
THE PARKING PORTION IS BECAUSE

01:47:10.524 --> 01:47:13.827
PARKING ADDS COST.

01:47:13.894 --> 01:47:15.796
AND WHILE MANY PEOPLE SAY THIS

01:47:15.862 --> 01:47:17.297
DOES NOTHING FOR AFFORDABILITY

01:47:17.364 --> 01:47:19.166
MY PURPOSE IS TO TRY TO EVEN

01:47:19.232 --> 01:47:20.834
BRING DOWN THE COST OF MARKET

01:47:20.901 --> 01:47:22.035
RATE.

01:47:22.102 --> 01:47:24.037
UNFORTUNATELY I CAN'T CONTROL

01:47:24.104 --> 01:47:25.105
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE THE

01:47:25.172 --> 01:47:26.940
HIGHEST COST OF CONSTRUCTION OF

01:47:27.007 --> 01:47:28.208
ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY.

01:47:28.275 --> 01:47:29.943
THAT IS SOMEWHAT OUT OF MY

01:47:30.010 --> 01:47:33.947
CONTROL BUT AT LEAST BY REMOVING

01:47:34.014 --> 01:47:36.850
THOSE COSTLY ELEMENTS THAT DO

01:47:36.917 --> 01:47:38.552
COULD WE DO HAVE CONTROL OVER

01:47:38.618 --> 01:47:39.886
AND THOSE COSTLY ELEMENTS ARE

01:47:39.953 --> 01:47:42.455
THINGS LIKE TIME AND UNCERTAINTY.

01:47:42.522 --> 01:47:44.324
BUT ALSO PARKING THAT WAS MY

01:47:44.391 --> 01:47:46.793
MOTIVATION IT WAS TO REMOVE THE

01:47:46.860 --> 01:47:48.562
REQUIREMENT OF PARKING IT WAS

01:47:48.628 --> 01:47:50.197
NOT TO PREVENT PARKING IF THE

01:47:50.263 --> 01:47:51.798
APPLICANT FELT THAT THEY NEEDED

01:47:51.865 --> 01:47:53.667
PARKING THIS BILL WOULD NOT OF

01:47:53.733 --> 01:47:54.401
PROHIBITED.

01:47:54.467 --> 01:47:57.137
BUT BECAUSE THE OPPOSITION HAS

01:47:57.204 --> 01:48:00.340
TURNED THAT INTO SECTION.

01:48:00.407 --> 01:48:01.408
YOU KNOW ENOUGH TO KILL THE

01:48:01.474 --> 01:48:03.376
BASIC OTHER ESSENTIAL BENEFITS

01:48:03.443 --> 01:48:05.445
OF THIS BILL I'M WILLING TO GET

01:48:05.512 --> 01:48:05.745
RID OF IT.

01:48:05.812 --> 01:48:08.215
SO I AM GONNA FULLY DELETE THE

01:48:08.281 --> 01:48:10.817
REFERENCES TO THE PARKING.

01:48:10.884 --> 01:48:13.253
SO THAT SECTION FIVE BE ONE THAT

01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:14.921
WILL BE DONE IN THE LOCAL

01:48:14.988 --> 01:48:16.623
GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE.

01:48:16.690 --> 01:48:18.491
AND I'M GOING TO ALSO FULLY

01:48:18.558 --> 01:48:19.793
ELIMINATE.

01:48:19.860 --> 01:48:21.528
THE PART THAT'S AROUND THAT

01:48:21.595 --> 01:48:23.563
WOULD HAVE RESTRICTED CHEST FOR

01:48:23.630 --> 01:48:25.565
THE FIVE YEARS.

01:48:25.632 --> 01:48:28.935
ANY VOTER -- REQUIREMENTS ON

01:48:29.002 --> 01:48:31.638
APPROVING.

01:48:31.705 --> 01:48:32.239
A CITIES.

01:48:32.305 --> 01:48:33.907
SO WE HAVE SOME COMMUNITIES

01:48:33.974 --> 01:48:36.543
WHERE IF THE CITY ACTS.

01:48:36.610 --> 01:48:38.478
TO PROVE CERTAIN PROJECTS THAT

01:48:38.545 --> 01:48:39.980
THEN HAS TO GO BEFORE THE VOTERS

01:48:40.046 --> 01:48:41.615
WHICH OF COURSE GREAT LEAD

01:48:41.681 --> 01:48:42.983
DELAYS THE PROJECT.

01:48:43.049 --> 01:48:45.418
AND ADD SIGNIFICANT COST BUT

01:48:45.485 --> 01:48:47.187
BECAUSE THE BILL IS ONLY IN

01:48:47.254 --> 01:48:48.989
EFFECT FOR FIVE YEARS AND IT'S

01:48:49.055 --> 01:48:51.124
HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT IN A FIVE

01:48:51.191 --> 01:48:52.726
YEAR PROCESS YOU WOULD HAVE.

01:48:52.792 --> 01:48:53.994
A LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACTING AND

01:48:54.060 --> 01:48:55.295
THEN THE ABILITY FOR THE VOTERS

01:48:55.362 --> 01:48:57.130
TO ACT IT'S JUST BETTER TO GET

01:48:57.197 --> 01:48:59.266
RID OF IT BECAUSE IT REMOVES

01:48:59.332 --> 01:49:01.167
THAN THIS THING THAT SOME

01:49:01.234 --> 01:49:03.003
OPPOSITION SEEMS TO HAVE LATCHED

01:49:03.069 --> 01:49:05.171
ON TO AS THE POISON PILL OF THE

01:49:05.238 --> 01:49:05.639
BILL.

01:49:05.705 --> 01:49:07.874
SO FINE WE'LL GET RID OF IT WE

01:49:07.941 --> 01:49:09.276
HAVE STILL PRESERVED THE

01:49:09.342 --> 01:49:11.711
ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF THE BILL

01:49:11.778 --> 01:49:14.247
WHICH IS TO RESPECT EXISTING

01:49:14.314 --> 01:49:16.216
ZONING BUT GIVE THE APPLICANT

01:49:16.283 --> 01:49:17.250
CERTAINTY.

01:49:17.317 --> 01:49:20.887
AND GIVE THEM A TIME LINE WHICH

01:49:20.954 --> 01:49:22.555
EXISTING LAW UNDER THE PERMIT

01:49:22.622 --> 01:49:25.992
STREAMLINING ACT ALLOWS.

01:49:26.059 --> 01:49:26.860
FOR SO THAT'S IN EFFECT WITH THE

01:49:26.927 --> 01:49:30.497
BILL DOES APOLOGIES FOR GIVING A

01:49:30.563 --> 01:49:32.899
BENEFITTED BY DOING SO.

01:49:32.966 --> 01:49:34.968
AND I WOULD NOW ALLOW MY

01:49:35.035 --> 01:49:36.636
WITNESSES IN SUPPORT TO SPEAK.

01:49:36.703 --> 01:49:40.307
THANK YOU SENATOR TO YOUR

01:49:40.373 --> 01:49:42.509
WITNESSES.

01:49:42.575 --> 01:49:43.109
GOOD MORNING CARE TO PRODUCT

01:49:43.176 --> 01:49:43.677
ALTHOUGH WITH THE NONPROFIT

01:49:43.743 --> 01:49:44.311
HOUSING ASSOCIATION OF NORTHERN

01:49:44.377 --> 01:49:45.645
CALIFORNIA.

01:49:45.712 --> 01:49:48.882
AND WHAT ONE CRITICAL THING

01:49:48.949 --> 01:49:51.284
WE'RE HERE STRONG SUPPORTERS OF

01:49:51.351 --> 01:49:53.053
SB THREE THIRTY BECAUSE WHILE IT

01:49:53.119 --> 01:49:55.088
IS NOT A BILL THAT'S EXCLUSIVELY

01:49:55.155 --> 01:49:56.656
FOCUSED IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE

01:49:56.723 --> 01:49:58.558
BELIEVE THAT IT WILL HAVE MANY

01:49:58.625 --> 01:50:00.060
BENEFITS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

01:50:00.126 --> 01:50:01.561
AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS LIKE

01:50:01.628 --> 01:50:04.164
ANY DEVELOPMENT STILL MUST PAY --

01:50:04.230 --> 01:50:06.599
IMPACT FEES AND STILL FACE THE

01:50:06.666 --> 01:50:09.903
LACK OF CERTAINTY OVER ISSUES

01:50:09.970 --> 01:50:11.604
THAT THIS BILL ADDRESSES LIKE.

01:50:11.671 --> 01:50:13.740
CERTAIN LIKE FEES ZONING AND

01:50:13.807 --> 01:50:15.475
EVEN HISTORIC STATUS.

01:50:15.542 --> 01:50:18.211
AND SO -- WITH THAT WITHOUT

01:50:18.278 --> 01:50:19.546
CERTAINTY THAT THIS BILL

01:50:19.612 --> 01:50:21.081
PROVIDES WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL

01:50:21.147 --> 01:50:22.682
BE ABLE TO BUILD AFFORDABLE

01:50:22.749 --> 01:50:24.217
HOUSING FASTER.

01:50:24.284 --> 01:50:26.219
THAT IS SO DESPERATELY NEEDED BY

01:50:26.286 --> 01:50:28.221
BAY AREA RESIDENTS AND BY

01:50:28.288 --> 01:50:30.991
CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS STATEWIDE --

01:50:31.057 --> 01:50:32.659
TO GIVE YOU AN AN IDEA RIGHT NOW

01:50:32.726 --> 01:50:34.227
IT TAKES A PROJECT ANYWHERE

01:50:34.294 --> 01:50:36.096
BETWEEN FROM FOUR TO TEN YEARS

01:50:36.162 --> 01:50:38.531
TO GO FROM CONCEPT TO REALITY.

01:50:38.598 --> 01:50:39.632
IF THIS BILL CAN SHORTEN THAT

01:50:39.699 --> 01:50:41.835
AMOUNT OF TIME EVEN BY A COUPLE

01:50:41.901 --> 01:50:43.703
OF MONTHS OR IDEALLY A COUPLE OF

01:50:43.770 --> 01:50:44.704
YEARS.

01:50:44.771 --> 01:50:46.639
THAT WOULD MEAN THAT HOMES CAN

01:50:46.706 --> 01:50:47.640
GET.

01:50:47.707 --> 01:50:48.475
THAT THAT WOULD MEAN THAT LOW

01:50:48.541 --> 01:50:49.943
INCOME CALIFORNIANS CAN GET A

01:50:50.010 --> 01:50:52.345
ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD FASTER AND

01:50:52.412 --> 01:50:54.147
THAT WE CAN GET ALL THE BENEFITS

01:50:54.214 --> 01:50:54.914
THAT COME WITH AFFORDABLE

01:50:54.981 --> 01:50:56.816
HOUSING SUCH AS THE BETTER

01:50:56.883 --> 01:50:58.351
EDUCATIONAL HEALTH.

01:50:58.418 --> 01:50:59.953
AND ENVIRONMENTAL OUTCOMES

01:51:00.020 --> 01:51:02.355
SOONER -- FOR OUR STATE AND SO

01:51:02.422 --> 01:51:03.590
FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE PROUD

01:51:03.656 --> 01:51:07.827
TO SUPPORT SB THREE THIRTY AND

01:51:07.894 --> 01:51:08.428

01:51:08.495 --> 01:51:12.799
VOTE.

01:51:12.866 --> 01:51:13.366
GOOD MORNING HOW THERE'S THE

01:51:13.433 --> 01:51:14.367
COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN CHIU MY NAME

01:51:14.434 --> 01:51:15.535
IS DAVID GARCIA ON THE POLICY

01:51:15.602 --> 01:51:16.669
DIRECTOR AT THE TURNER CENTER

01:51:16.736 --> 01:51:17.337
FOR HOUSING INNOVATION.

01:51:17.404 --> 01:51:18.505
AT UC BERKELEY WE'RE HERE TODAY

01:51:18.571 --> 01:51:20.740
IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL THREE

01:51:20.807 --> 01:51:21.341
THIRTY I THINK IT GOES WITHOUT

01:51:21.408 --> 01:51:22.809
SAYING PARTICULARLY TO THIS

01:51:22.876 --> 01:51:23.843
COMMITTEE THAT.

01:51:23.910 --> 01:51:26.079
WE ARE IN THE DPTHS OF A DEEP

01:51:26.146 --> 01:51:27.180
AND WORSENING HOUSING CRISIS IN

01:51:27.247 --> 01:51:29.249
CALIFORNIA WHERE WE HAVE OVER

01:51:29.315 --> 01:51:32.052
HALF OF OUR RENTER'S PAYING MORE --

01:51:32.118 --> 01:51:34.287
THAN -- 30% OF THEIR THEIR

01:51:34.354 --> 01:51:35.755
INCOME ON RENT AND OF THOSE WE

01:51:35.822 --> 01:51:36.790
HAVE ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION

01:51:36.856 --> 01:51:39.159
PAYING MORE THAN 50% OF THEIR

01:51:39.225 --> 01:51:40.193
INCOME ON RENT AND SO.

01:51:40.260 --> 01:51:41.227
ON TOP OF THAT'S WE ARE

01:51:41.294 --> 01:51:42.629
EXPERIENCING OUR LOWEST LEVELS

01:51:42.695 --> 01:51:44.664
OF HOMEOWNERSHIP SINCE THE

01:51:44.731 --> 01:51:45.231
NINETEEN FORTY SO IT'S CLEAR

01:51:45.298 --> 01:51:47.133
THAT THE SCALE OF THIS CHALLENGE

01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:50.303
DEMANDS SOLUTIONS -- THAT MATCH

01:51:50.370 --> 01:51:50.970
THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM AND

01:51:51.037 --> 01:51:54.074
THERE ARE FEW PROPOSALS -- LEFT

01:51:54.140 --> 01:51:55.041
ON THE TABLE THIS SESSION THAT

01:51:55.108 --> 01:51:57.677
ARE AS IMPORTANT AS SENATE BILL

01:51:57.744 --> 01:51:58.545
THREE THIRTY SO WE'RE SUPPORTING

01:51:58.611 --> 01:51:59.279
THIS BILL FOR TWO SPECIFIC

01:51:59.345 --> 01:52:01.081
REASONS THEY'RE SUPPORTED BY OUR

01:52:01.147 --> 01:52:02.715
RESEARCH IN THE FIRST IS THAT.

01:52:02.782 --> 01:52:03.950
THIS BILL LARGELY PROHIBITS

01:52:04.017 --> 01:52:05.485
CITIES FROM ENACTING A DOWN

01:52:05.552 --> 01:52:06.953
ZONING TO MORATORIUM'S THAT

01:52:07.020 --> 01:52:08.088
WOULD LIMIT THE LIMIT THE

01:52:08.154 --> 01:52:10.290
CAPACITY OF NEW HOUSING AND AS

01:52:10.356 --> 01:52:12.425
OUR WORK HAS SHOWN THROUGH OUR

01:52:12.492 --> 01:52:14.260
CALIFORNIA WHEN YOU SURVEY.

01:52:14.327 --> 01:52:15.462
MOST CITIES ARE DOING THEIR

01:52:15.528 --> 01:52:17.730
PARTS TO REDUCE BARRIERS TO NEW

01:52:17.797 --> 01:52:19.265
CONSTRUCTION BUT UNFORTUNATELY

01:52:19.332 --> 01:52:21.067
THERE ARE STILL SOME PLACES THAT

01:52:21.134 --> 01:52:23.136
ARE USING LAND USE POLICIES IN A

01:52:23.203 --> 01:52:24.437
RESTRICTIVE MANNER. TO MAKE IT.

01:52:24.504 --> 01:52:25.505
MORE DIFFICULT TO BUILD NEW

01:52:25.572 --> 01:52:27.874
HOMES IN MANY TIMES THESE PLACES

01:52:27.941 --> 01:52:29.576
ARE -- AREAS THAT THE STATE HAS

01:52:29.642 --> 01:52:31.377
DEEMED HI OPPORTUNITY AND THAT

01:52:31.444 --> 01:52:32.579
WE ARE WE WOULD LIKE TO

01:52:32.645 --> 01:52:33.847
PRIORITIZE THE CONSTRUCTION OF

01:52:33.913 --> 01:52:35.048
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THESE

01:52:35.115 --> 01:52:36.316
LOCATIONS.

01:52:36.382 --> 01:52:37.684
AND SO THE SECOND REASON WE'RE

01:52:37.750 --> 01:52:38.852
SUPPORTING THIS BILL IS THAT IT

01:52:38.918 --> 01:52:40.820
WOULD HAVE A MEANINGFUL IMPACT

01:52:40.887 --> 01:52:42.522
ON THE COST AND TIME THAT IT

01:52:42.589 --> 01:52:43.590
TAKES TO DELIVER HOUSING

01:52:43.656 --> 01:52:45.291
CALIFORNIA WE HAVE WORK FORCE

01:52:45.358 --> 01:52:46.559
COMING NEXT MONTH.

01:52:46.626 --> 01:52:48.361
ON THE COST TO BUILD A DEED

01:52:48.428 --> 01:52:49.596
RESTRICTED AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:52:49.662 --> 01:52:51.631
CALIFORNIA AND OUR RESEARCH IS

01:52:51.698 --> 01:52:53.032
SHOWING THAT THINGS LIKE PARKING

01:52:53.099 --> 01:52:56.336
THINGS LIKE -- INCREASING FEES

01:52:56.402 --> 01:52:57.570
UNCERTAIN TIME LINES THESE ARE

01:52:57.637 --> 01:52:58.338
AT A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNTS OF

01:52:58.404 --> 01:53:00.640
COSTS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND

01:53:00.707 --> 01:53:02.008
WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT NEW

01:53:02.075 --> 01:53:03.276
RESOURCES THANKS TO LEADERSHIP

01:53:03.343 --> 01:53:05.111
AT THE STATE LEVEL. TO BUILD

01:53:05.178 --> 01:53:10.116
MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT TO

01:53:10.183 --> 01:53:11.584
THE EXTENT THAT COSTS KEEP

01:53:11.651 --> 01:53:12.785
RISING.

01:53:12.852 --> 01:53:14.154
THOSE NEW RESOURCES WILL NOT BE

01:53:14.220 --> 01:53:15.155
AS EFFICIENT AND AS EFFECTIVE AS

01:53:15.221 --> 01:53:16.890
THEY COULD BE AND SO THIS BILL

01:53:16.956 --> 01:53:17.457
BY LOCKING IN WHAT COULD BE

01:53:17.524 --> 01:53:18.791
CHARGING FEES AND SIMPLY ASKING

01:53:18.858 --> 01:53:19.025
CITIES.

01:53:19.092 --> 01:53:20.160
TO BE A BIT MORE EXPEDITIOUS

01:53:20.226 --> 01:53:22.061
WITH THE APPROVAL PROCESS THE

01:53:22.128 --> 01:53:23.363
PROCESS IS ALREADY HAVE IN PLACE

01:53:23.429 --> 01:53:25.231
THIS KIND OF A MEANINGFUL IMPACT

01:53:25.298 --> 01:53:27.967
ON OUR ABILITY. TO QUICKLY AND

01:53:28.034 --> 01:53:29.903
EFFICIENTLY DELIVER -- HOMES

01:53:29.969 --> 01:53:32.572
PARTICULARLY AFFORDABLE HOMES SO --

01:53:32.639 --> 01:53:33.206

WANT TO LOOK AT THE NEW

01:56:20.073 --> 01:56:20.540
AMENDMENTS WE'VE MOVED TO

01:56:20.606 --> 01:56:22.408
NEUTRAL.

01:56:22.475 --> 01:56:23.343
AND LOOK FORWARD TO REASSESS IT

01:56:23.409 --> 01:56:27.013
OUR POSITION AFTER WE SEE THEM

01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:27.613
BUT THE REST THE MEMBERS THANK

01:56:27.680 --> 01:56:29.115
YOU.

01:56:29.182 --> 01:56:29.816
ME ASK IF THERE IS ANY

01:56:29.882 --> 01:56:46.232
OPPOSITION TO THE BILL

01:56:46.666 --> 01:56:46.733
.

01:56:46.733 --> 01:56:50.770
PLEASE YES HELLO THANK YOU I AM.

01:56:50.837 --> 01:56:51.337
MY NAME IS AVAILABLE AT THIS

01:56:51.404 --> 01:56:52.038
TIME IN.

01:56:52.105 --> 01:56:53.773
CO DIRECTOR WITH THE SAN DIEGO

01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:54.440
TENANTS UNION.

01:56:54.507 --> 01:56:55.708
I WE REPRESENT AND ORGANIZE

01:56:55.775 --> 01:56:57.810
TENANTS THROUGHOUT THE CITY OF

01:56:57.877 --> 01:56:59.145
SAN DIEGO.

01:56:59.212 --> 01:57:01.280
AND WE STRONGLY OPPOSE THREE

01:57:01.347 --> 01:57:02.782
THIRTY WEEK WE BELIEVE THIS IS A

01:57:02.849 --> 01:57:03.983
DISPLACEMENT BILL.

01:57:04.050 --> 01:57:05.318
WE BELIEVE IN A CITY LIKE SAN

01:57:05.385 --> 01:57:08.654
DIEGO THAT'S PRO DEVELOPER --

01:57:08.721 --> 01:57:11.124
THIS DOES VERY LITTLE TO PROTECT

01:57:11.190 --> 01:57:12.191
TENANTS THIS ACTUALLY.

01:57:12.258 --> 01:57:14.727
MAKES THE HOUSING CRISIS WORSE

01:57:14.794 --> 01:57:15.395
BY.

01:57:15.461 --> 01:57:17.263
POURING FOR MORE GASOLINE ON THE

01:57:17.330 --> 01:57:18.264
FIRE.

01:57:18.331 --> 01:57:20.366
THE SPOT ZONING IS A REAL

01:57:20.433 --> 01:57:21.968
PROBLEM I DON'T ESPECIALLY WHEN

01:57:22.034 --> 01:57:23.436
YOU COMBINE IT WITH.

01:57:23.503 --> 01:57:25.204
THE FACT THAT THERE'S AN

01:57:25.271 --> 01:57:28.241
ENCOURAGING OF DEVELOPERS.

01:57:28.307 --> 01:57:30.877
HAVING THE ABILITY TO SUE.

01:57:30.943 --> 01:57:33.079
THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT IF THEY

01:57:33.146 --> 01:57:34.080
DON'T APPROVE THEIR PROJECT.

01:57:34.147 --> 01:57:35.848
WE BELIEVE THIS IS SOMETHING

01:57:35.915 --> 01:57:39.051
THAT'S GONNA STRAIN I OUR

01:57:39.118 --> 01:57:39.986
RESOURCES AT THE AT THE LOCAL

01:57:40.052 --> 01:57:41.421
LEVEL.

01:57:41.487 --> 01:57:42.855
WE THINK THIS IS PART OF A

01:57:42.922 --> 01:57:44.957
PATTERN.

01:57:45.024 --> 01:57:46.526
OF POLICY MAKING THAT'S

01:57:46.592 --> 01:57:49.996
SUPPORTIVE OF DEVELOPERS AND IS

01:57:50.062 --> 01:57:52.031
NOT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THAT IT.

01:57:52.098 --> 01:57:53.332
THESE ARE IN FACT -- BILLS LIKE

01:57:53.399 --> 01:57:55.301
SB FIFTY THAT ARE DISPLACING

01:57:55.368 --> 01:57:56.803
COMMUNITIES -- THESE ARE

01:57:56.869 --> 01:57:59.539
ACCELERATING THE DISPLACEMENT OF

01:57:59.605 --> 01:58:01.340
COMMUNITIES AND EXCELLING

01:58:01.407 --> 01:58:02.942
ACCELERATING GENTRIFICATION.

01:58:03.009 --> 01:58:04.243
WHAT WE'RE ALREADY SEEN IT

01:58:04.310 --> 01:58:07.713
HAPPEN -- ANIME ON A MASS SCALE

01:58:07.780 --> 01:58:09.382
WE'RE SEEING.

01:58:09.449 --> 01:58:11.317
RENT INCREASES AND ABUSES BY A

01:58:11.384 --> 01:58:13.186
OWNERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT.

01:58:13.252 --> 01:58:15.188
THAT IS GOING ON CHECK --

01:58:15.254 --> 01:58:17.523
BECAUSE IN CITIES LIKE SAN DIEGO

01:58:17.590 --> 01:58:18.758
WITH THEIR NO RENTAL.

01:58:18.825 --> 01:58:20.393
LIEUTENANT PROTECTIONS VERY

01:58:20.460 --> 01:58:23.429
LIMITED TEN PROTECTIONS -- WE

01:58:23.496 --> 01:58:26.532
NEED MORE PROTECTIONS BEFORE WE

01:58:26.599 --> 01:58:28.568
NEED MORE DISPLACEMENT.

01:58:28.634 --> 01:58:30.937
AND THESE BILLS ARE TAKING THE

01:58:31.003 --> 01:58:32.839
WRONG APPROACH THEY'RE MAKING IT

01:58:32.905 --> 01:58:34.307
SO THAT THERE IS MORE

01:58:34.373 --> 01:58:35.575
DISPLACEMENT.

01:58:35.641 --> 01:58:36.709
AT FASTER RATES [inaudible]

01:58:36.776 --> 01:58:38.544
WITH.

01:58:38.611 --> 01:58:40.079
NO PROTECTIONS ON RENT CONTROL

01:58:40.146 --> 01:58:41.514
NO PROTECTIONS ON TEN AND JUST

01:58:41.581 --> 01:58:43.316
BECAUSE YOU'VE ACTIONS THERE'S

01:58:43.382 --> 01:58:46.152
NO PROTECTIONS ON YOU KNOW WHAT

01:58:46.219 --> 01:58:48.321
WE TALK ABOUT RELOCATION BUT IN

01:58:48.387 --> 01:58:50.056
SAN DIEGO THERE'S NO RIGHT

01:58:50.122 --> 01:58:50.756
RELOCATION ASSISTANCE.

01:58:50.823 --> 01:58:52.692
SO.

01:58:52.758 --> 01:58:54.260
YOU KNOW THE COSTS ARE GETTING

01:58:54.327 --> 01:58:55.394
OUT OF HAND THE RENTS ARE

01:58:55.461 --> 01:58:58.064
ALREADY BEYOND REACH AND THIS IS

01:58:58.130 --> 01:59:01.801
EXACERBATING A PROBLEM THAT --

01:59:01.868 --> 01:59:02.635
WILL SOON.

01:59:02.702 --> 01:59:05.238
TURN INTO A A MUCH.

01:59:05.304 --> 01:59:06.305
THIS COULD BE A CATASTROPHE NOT

01:59:06.372 --> 01:59:08.040
ONLY A CRISIS IS COULD BE A

01:59:08.107 --> 01:59:08.841
CATASTROPHE.

01:59:08.908 --> 01:59:11.310
AND BILLS LIKE THIS ARE LEADING

01:59:11.377 --> 01:59:12.445
THAT.

01:59:12.512 --> 01:59:14.547
CHARGE AGAINST A COMMUNITY.

01:59:14.614 --> 01:59:16.582
SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT.

01:59:16.649 --> 01:59:18.050
WHEN WE'RE TAKING THE APPROACH

01:59:18.117 --> 01:59:20.520
IN SOLVING THE HOUSING CRISIS WE

01:59:20.586 --> 01:59:20.753
DON'T?

01:59:20.820 --> 01:59:21.954
YOU KNOW.

01:59:22.021 --> 01:59:22.688
GIVE EVERYTHING TO THE VALOUR

01:59:22.755 --> 01:59:25.858
BRIDGE WHO HAVE INTENTIONALLY

01:59:25.925 --> 01:59:27.527
SURPRISE BUILDING.

01:59:27.593 --> 01:59:29.529
I'D JUST SO THAT THEY CAN GET

01:59:29.595 --> 01:59:31.531
THESE TYPES OF PERKS AND START

01:59:31.597 --> 01:59:34.400
CONSTRUCTING AT DIFFERENT THINGS

01:59:34.467 --> 01:59:36.135
IN DIFFERENT PLACES THAT WERE

01:59:36.202 --> 01:59:38.104
NOT COMMON IN SOME OF THESE

01:59:38.170 --> 01:59:39.639
THINGS ARE -- POINT TO

01:59:39.705 --> 01:59:41.440
GENTRIFICATION AND SOME OF THESE

01:59:41.507 --> 01:59:43.776
THINGS ARE RECOGNIZED AS A

01:59:43.843 --> 01:59:45.978
CONTRIBUTING CSU DISPLACEMENT.

01:59:46.045 --> 01:59:49.949
SO WE STRONGLY URGE OPPOSITION.

01:59:50.016 --> 01:59:54.420
IF -- MEMBERS SAY THAT THEY ARE --

01:59:54.487 --> 01:59:55.421
SUPPORTING THINGS LIKE RENT

01:59:55.488 --> 01:59:57.089
CONTROL.

01:59:57.156 --> 01:59:58.357
WE WANT TO SEE UNIVERSAL RENT

01:59:58.424 --> 01:59:59.559
CONTROL WE WANT TO SEE A REPEAL

01:59:59.625 --> 02:00:01.160
OF COSTA HAWKINS.

02:00:01.227 --> 02:00:01.761
WE WANT TO SEE THE RIGHT TO

02:00:01.827 --> 02:00:03.496
ORGANIZE WE DON'T WANT TO SEE

02:00:03.563 --> 02:00:04.697
THESE TYPES OF DISPLACEMNT

02:00:04.764 --> 02:00:06.566
BILLS THAT SHOW.

02:00:06.632 --> 02:00:08.100
LIKE IN PLACES LIKE SAN DIEGO

02:00:08.167 --> 02:00:09.902
THAT THINGS ARE.

02:00:09.969 --> 02:00:11.470
BEING GRANTED TO DEVELOPERS AT

02:00:11.537 --> 02:00:13.606
THERE WILL.

02:00:13.673 --> 02:00:15.808
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT.

02:00:15.875 --> 02:00:16.609
THERE'S AN UNDERSTANDING THAT

02:00:16.676 --> 02:00:18.044
THE GOVERNMENT IS WORKING FOR

02:00:18.110 --> 02:00:23.816
THE PEOPLE NOT FOR DEVELOPERS.

02:00:23.883 --> 02:00:26.852
HI MY NAME IS AJMAL JONES -- I

02:00:34.126 --> 02:00:35.394
PUTTING EFFORTS AND TRYING TO

02:00:35.461 --> 02:00:37.597
ADDRESS THIS -- CRISIS THAT IS

02:00:37.663 --> 02:00:38.864
AGAIN STATEWIDE AND WE'RE

02:00:38.931 --> 02:00:40.600
EXPERIENCING IT.

02:00:40.666 --> 02:00:43.169
IN LOS ANGELES AS WELL -- FEW

02:00:43.235 --> 02:00:45.972
WEEKS AGO -- WE HAD A MEETING ON

02:00:46.038 --> 02:00:48.608
SOUTH LOS ANGELES -- REGARDING A

02:00:48.674 --> 02:00:50.977
PROPOSED LEGISLATION THAT MAY

02:00:51.043 --> 02:00:54.413
POSSIBLY -- GIVE MORE UP HARD TO

02:00:54.480 --> 02:00:56.449
DEVELOPERS IN THE PLANNING.

02:00:56.515 --> 02:00:58.317
OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND IT WAS A

02:00:58.384 --> 02:00:58.818
REALLY STRONG POINT OF

02:00:58.884 --> 02:00:59.852
CONTENTION.

02:00:59.919 --> 02:01:00.920
ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE FACT OVER A

02:01:00.987 --> 02:01:04.790
DECADE -- COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND

02:01:04.857 --> 02:01:05.958
ELECTED OFFICIALS AND FOLKS --

02:01:06.025 --> 02:01:07.960
HELP DEVELOP A COMMUNITY PLAN IT

02:01:08.027 --> 02:01:09.729
MADE SENSE FOR THE COMMUNITY AND

02:01:09.795 --> 02:01:11.731
AND THIS -- THIS POSSIBILITY

02:01:11.797 --> 02:01:13.265
THERE'S A THERE'S A STRONG

02:01:13.332 --> 02:01:14.166
POSSIBILITY THAT THE PACKAGE BE

02:01:14.233 --> 02:01:15.501
WIPED AWAY.

02:01:15.568 --> 02:01:21.507
AND AGAIN BACK.

02:01:21.574 --> 02:01:22.808
TO THE EVENT I MEAN WE PLANTED

02:01:22.875 --> 02:01:23.476
IN A WEEK A PRINTER FIFTY PEOPLE

02:01:23.542 --> 02:01:24.243
CAME OUT SO IT'S IT'S A REALLY

02:01:24.310 --> 02:01:25.378
STRONG POINT OF CONTENTION --

02:01:25.444 --> 02:01:26.579
ONE OF MY OTHER CONCERNS IN

02:01:26.646 --> 02:01:29.181
REGARD TO THIS BILL IS THE

02:01:29.248 --> 02:01:32.752
ADDRESSING AFFORDABILITY -- JUST

02:01:32.818 --> 02:01:34.754
IN OUR COMMUNITY -- THERE'S

02:01:34.820 --> 02:01:35.988
THERE IS THERE IS HOUSING BEING

02:01:36.055 --> 02:01:37.023
BUILT I MEAN YOU SEE IT ALL THE

02:01:37.089 --> 02:01:38.924
TIME AND WE WERE WEIRD LOS

02:01:38.991 --> 02:01:40.760
ANGELES IS MOVING FOR WITH THAT --

02:01:40.826 --> 02:01:42.628
I'M I'VE GOT A QUESTION THAT BUT

02:01:42.695 --> 02:01:44.964
THE ISSUE IS AFFORDABILITY --

02:01:45.031 --> 02:01:46.532
YOU JUST TALK TO THE NEIGHBORS

02:01:46.599 --> 02:01:48.100
AND IS OKAY THERE'S A NEW

02:01:48.167 --> 02:01:49.402
BUILDING COMING OUT BUT THEY

02:01:49.468 --> 02:01:50.536
CAN'T AFFORD IT.

02:01:50.603 --> 02:01:52.638
SO HOUSING IS THERE SO IT'S JUST.

02:01:52.705 --> 02:01:53.873
BUT THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT SO

02:01:53.939 --> 02:01:56.342
THAT'S JUST THE BIG AGAIN A BIG

02:01:56.409 --> 02:01:56.942
POINT OF CONTENTION WITHIN OUR

02:01:57.009 --> 02:02:00.079
COMMUNITY -- I KNOW THE CITY

02:02:00.146 --> 02:02:01.247
AGAIN HAS A HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:02:01.313 --> 02:02:03.215
UNITS THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED.

02:02:03.282 --> 02:02:04.583
BUT AGAIN GOING BACK TO

02:02:04.650 --> 02:02:06.719
AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- THAT'S

02:02:06.786 --> 02:02:12.358
JUST A BIG ISSUE -- BOB THE RISK

02:02:12.425 --> 02:02:13.426
I WAS TALKING AGAIN I WAS

02:02:13.492 --> 02:02:13.993
TALKING TO OUR OVER DRIVERS

YOU SEE THIS IN A CITY IN MY

02:02:17.496 --> 02:02:18.898
COMMUNITY WE GOT NEIGHBORS ARE

SUSTAIN THEMSELVES IN OUR

02:02:21.701 --> 02:02:22.968
NEIGHBORHOOD.

02:02:23.035 --> 02:02:25.871
AND IT'S JUST THEY NEED THIS

02:02:25.938 --> 02:02:26.806
HOUSING AND THEIR THEIR MEMBERS

02:02:26.872 --> 02:02:28.074
ARE COULD OF OUR COMMUNITY BUT

02:02:28.140 --> 02:02:29.408

MILLION DOLLAR HOUSES AND PEOPLE

CAN'T LIVE IN NEIGHBORHOODS AND

02:02:41.053 --> 02:02:42.822
COMMUNITIES THAT THEY'VE BEEN IN.

02:02:42.888 --> 02:02:44.356

THE THE SAME ARGUMENTS THEN GOT

02:12:05.150 --> 02:12:06.351
APPLIED TO THIS BILL WITHOUT

02:12:06.418 --> 02:12:08.186
REALLY LOOKING AT ITS CONTENT

02:12:08.253 --> 02:12:10.022
THIS BILL DOES NOT.

02:12:10.088 --> 02:12:12.958

SORRY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT THAT.

02:12:26.838 --> 02:12:28.340
I IN I DON'T HAVE THE DATA

02:12:28.407 --> 02:12:29.875

OAKLAND AND BERKELEY.

02:12:40.018 --> 02:12:42.587
MINIMUM FIVE YEARS AND UP TO TEN

02:12:42.654 --> 02:12:45.057
YEARS BEFORE THEY GET A PERMIT

02:12:45.123 --> 02:12:46.692
AND BY THE TIME THEY GET THEIR

02:12:46.758 --> 02:12:49.027
PERMIT FOR A 100% AFFORDABLE

02:12:49.094 --> 02:12:49.328
[inaudible]

02:12:49.394 --> 02:12:50.796
PROJECT.

02:12:50.862 --> 02:12:52.931
THERE FINANCING IS COMPLETELY

02:12:52.998 --> 02:12:54.399
OUT OF DATE.

02:12:54.466 --> 02:12:55.901
AND THEY HAVE TO START OVER.

02:12:55.967 --> 02:12:58.837
SO THIS BENEFITS BECAUSE WHAT IT

02:12:58.904 --> 02:13:01.206
DOES IS SAY WHATEVER IS IN YOUR

02:13:01.273 --> 02:13:03.742
EXISTING ZONING RULES ONCE THE

02:13:05.310 --> 02:13:06.712
APPLICATION.

02:13:06.778 --> 02:13:08.347
AND YOU THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT

02:13:08.413 --> 02:13:09.181
HAVE I'M GONNA USE THE WERE

02:13:09.247 --> 02:13:10.849
DEEMED COMPLETE THERE'S A LEGAL

02:13:10.916 --> 02:13:12.617
DEFINITION FOR THAT SO I DON'T

02:13:12.684 --> 02:13:14.619
MEAN THE LEGAL DEFINITION I MEAN.

02:13:14.686 --> 02:13:16.755
AS IT DESCRIBES IN THE BILL THAT

02:13:16.822 --> 02:13:18.223
YOU HAVE GIVEN THE LOCAL

02:13:18.290 --> 02:13:19.458
GOVERNMENT EVERYTHING THEY'VE

02:13:19.524 --> 02:13:21.126
REQUESTED AN EVERYTHING THAT'S

02:13:21.193 --> 02:13:22.527
DESCRIBED IN THE BILL.

02:13:22.594 --> 02:13:25.297
THAT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT NEEDS

02:13:25.364 --> 02:13:26.898
TO ANALYZE THE PERMIT.

02:13:26.965 --> 02:13:28.600
AND AT THAT POINT OF COURSE THE

02:13:28.667 --> 02:13:30.035
LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAN.

02:13:30.102 --> 02:13:31.503
GIVE YOU A PROJECT SPECIFIC FEET

02:13:31.570 --> 02:13:33.238
IT DOES NOT PREVENT THE LOCAL

02:13:33.305 --> 02:13:35.073
GOVERNMENT FOR APPLYING THE

02:13:35.140 --> 02:13:36.641
PROJECT SPECIFIC FEET THEY JUST

02:13:36.708 --> 02:13:39.544
HAVE TO APPLY ITAT THAT POINT.

02:13:39.611 --> 02:13:42.948
BUT THEN FROM THAT POINT ON AS

02:13:43.014 --> 02:13:43.715
THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS

02:13:43.782 --> 02:13:45.851
ANALYZING IT.

02:13:45.917 --> 02:13:47.886
IT LOCKS BEING SENT SO MAYBE

02:13:47.953 --> 02:13:48.954
THAT'S WHAT THEY THINK IS

02:13:49.020 --> 02:13:50.389
PROJECT SPECIFIC SOMEBODY I

02:13:50.455 --> 02:13:51.723
DON'T KNOW BUT IT JUST LOCKS IT

02:13:51.790 --> 02:13:53.992
NOW IT DOESN'T EVEN REQUIRE THE

02:13:54.059 --> 02:13:55.394
LOCAL GOVERNMENT. TO PROVE YOUR

02:13:55.460 --> 02:13:56.695
PERMIT.

02:13:56.762 --> 02:13:58.096
THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COULD DENY

02:13:58.163 --> 02:13:59.331
IT AND THERE'S NOTHING IN THE

02:13:59.398 --> 02:14:00.866
BILL THAT PREVENTS THE LOCAL

02:14:00.932 --> 02:14:02.801
GOVERNMENTS FROM DENYING IT

02:14:02.868 --> 02:14:04.436
OTHER THAN ANY EXISTING.

02:14:04.503 --> 02:14:06.438
LEGISLATION FOR EXAMPLE EXISTING

02:14:06.505 --> 02:14:07.773
STATUTE LIKE THE HOUSING

02:14:07.839 --> 02:14:10.609
ACCOUNTABILITY ACT SO AGAIN I'M

02:14:10.675 --> 02:14:12.477
NOT SURE WELL AS POSSIBLE SURE

02:14:12.544 --> 02:14:13.412
IF YOU WANTED.

02:14:13.478 --> 02:14:14.579
QUESTIONS BUT YEAH I THINK I

02:14:14.646 --> 02:14:15.614
THINK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SPOT

02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:18.083
ZONING IT'S ALREADY LARGELY.

02:14:18.150 --> 02:14:20.218
AVAILABLE IN IN DIFFERENT CITIES

02:14:20.285 --> 02:14:23.889
AND COMMUNITIES AND AND COUNTIES.

02:14:23.955 --> 02:14:24.890
WHAT WHAT THIS BILL IS IS IS

02:14:24.956 --> 02:14:26.358
FACILITATING?

02:14:26.425 --> 02:14:29.394
DEVELOPERS TO COME IN AND AND

02:14:29.461 --> 02:14:31.530
TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF IT AND

02:14:31.596 --> 02:14:33.298
SAY WELL IF YOU DON'T GET THIS

02:14:33.365 --> 02:14:34.733
LUXURY COMPLEX HERE IN THIS

02:14:34.800 --> 02:14:36.535
SPECIFIC PLACE THEN I'M GOING TO

02:14:36.601 --> 02:14:37.536
SUE YOU.

02:14:37.602 --> 02:14:39.404
AND AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT WENT

02:14:39.471 --> 02:14:40.338
WHEN YOU'RE REDUCING THE TIME

02:14:40.405 --> 02:14:42.474
FRAMES YOUR XCELERATED SOME OF

02:14:42.541 --> 02:14:44.176
THESE THINGS -- ACCELERATING TO

02:14:44.242 --> 02:14:45.577
A POINT WHERE THEY MIGHT BE

02:14:45.644 --> 02:14:47.612
OVERSIGHT WHERE THEY MIGHT BE --

02:14:47.679 --> 02:14:50.615
COMPELLED TO NOT REVIEW IN THE

02:14:50.682 --> 02:14:52.451
WAY THEY SHOULD BE REVIEWING --

02:14:52.517 --> 02:14:53.585
EACH PROPOSAL.

02:14:53.652 --> 02:14:56.521
AND SO THESE ARE THESE ARE REAL

02:14:56.588 --> 02:14:58.023
ISSUES THAT YOU KNOW.

02:14:58.089 --> 02:14:59.491
MAYBE YOU'RE NOT CREATING THEM

02:14:59.558 --> 02:15:00.759
IMMEDIATELY BUT YOU'RE

02:15:00.826 --> 02:15:02.227
FACILITATING.

02:15:02.294 --> 02:15:04.095
THAT THAT SITUATION AND AND

02:15:04.162 --> 02:15:06.598
THAT'S WHY WE'RE SAYING THIS IS

02:15:06.665 --> 02:15:07.165
THE SPOT ZONING BILL BECAUSE

02:15:07.232 --> 02:15:09.568
IT'S YOU KNOW THE THE THE

02:15:09.634 --> 02:15:10.802
LIKELIHOOD THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE

02:15:10.869 --> 02:15:11.937
EXPLOITING THAT.

02:15:12.003 --> 02:15:16.308
IT INCREASES ARE SUBSTANTIALLY.

02:15:16.374 --> 02:15:17.609
SO TECHNICALLY THE BILL DOES NOT

02:15:17.676 --> 02:15:18.543
TWO SPOTS ONLY WHAT THE ARGUMENT

02:15:18.610 --> 02:15:19.978
IS IS IF.

02:15:20.045 --> 02:15:22.147
A LOCAL GOVERNMENT ALREADY HAS

02:15:22.214 --> 02:15:24.316
SPOT SOUND BUT OF COURSE THIS IS

02:15:24.382 --> 02:15:27.352
TRYING TO RESPECT THE LOCAL

02:15:27.419 --> 02:15:29.187
GOVERNMENTS EXISTING ZONING.

02:15:29.254 --> 02:15:30.589
SHE WAS ABOUT TO STE IS FOR A

02:15:30.655 --> 02:15:31.490
DEFINITION THE QUESTION BIG

02:15:31.556 --> 02:15:33.191
CELEBRATION AT BECAUSE SPOT

02:15:33.258 --> 02:15:34.493
ZONING WOULD BE.

02:15:34.559 --> 02:15:35.760
WHAT I WAS ACTUALLY CONCERNED

02:15:35.827 --> 02:15:36.428
ABOUT WITH REGARD TO THE PARKING

02:15:36.495 --> 02:15:38.196
REQUIREMENTS IS TAKING SPECIFIC

02:15:38.263 --> 02:15:39.397
AREAS NAY OF IN THE ORIGINAL

02:15:39.464 --> 02:15:40.432
VERSION OF THE BILL WITH A

02:15:40.499 --> 02:15:41.733
QUARTER MILE OF CERTAIN FORMS OF

02:15:41.800 --> 02:15:42.868
TRANSIT?

02:15:42.934 --> 02:15:44.269
IN CHANGING THE KINDS OF

02:15:44.336 --> 02:15:46.171
ENTITLEMENTS THERE UNDER THAT

02:15:46.238 --> 02:15:47.005
PROVISION.

02:15:47.072 --> 02:15:48.540
WILL USUALLY IT WILL BE DELETED

02:15:48.607 --> 02:15:49.708
YES I'M SO THAT WAS THE CLOSEST

02:15:49.774 --> 02:15:50.809
I CAN GET AND THIS IS A

02:15:50.876 --> 02:15:52.277
SIGNIFICANT CONCERN FOR THOSE

02:15:52.344 --> 02:15:52.777
WAS TO SERVE THE LOCAL

02:15:52.844 --> 02:15:54.379
GOVERNMENT. FOR THE STATE

02:15:54.446 --> 02:15:56.481
GOVERNMENT TO DICTATE THE FORM.

02:15:56.548 --> 02:15:57.883
OF OF THE OF THE DEVELOP AN

02:15:57.949 --> 02:15:59.918
ENVELOPE THIS BILL DOES NOT DO

02:15:59.985 --> 02:16:01.753
THIS WHAT THIS BILL SPEAKS TO IS

02:16:01.820 --> 02:16:02.954
TIMING AND COST.

02:16:03.021 --> 02:16:04.322
WHICH I UNDERSTAND THE POINT

02:16:04.389 --> 02:16:05.757
ABOUT THAT FACILITATING.

02:16:05.824 --> 02:16:08.260
DEVELOPMENT BUT IT IS ALSO TRUE

02:16:08.326 --> 02:16:09.327
AND THIS WAS ONE OF THE OTHER

02:16:09.394 --> 02:16:10.795
OBJECTIONS THAT WERE RAISES THE

02:16:10.862 --> 02:16:12.731
ISSUE AROUND FOR ABILITY HE SAID

02:16:12.797 --> 02:16:13.365
IT ALREADY BUT I THINK IT BEARS

02:16:13.431 --> 02:16:14.366
REPEATING.

02:16:14.432 --> 02:16:17.202
THIS BILL IS NOT LIMITED ONLY --

02:16:17.269 --> 02:16:18.470
TO FOR MARKET RATE DEVELOPMENT

02:16:18.537 --> 02:16:20.038
THIS THE BILL APPLIES TO ALL

02:16:20.105 --> 02:16:21.673
DEVELOPMENT INCLUDING SUBSIDIZED

02:16:21.740 --> 02:16:23.508
DEVELOPMENT WHICH IS REFLECTED

02:16:23.575 --> 02:16:25.310
IN THE SUPPORT LISTS THAT IS IN

02:16:25.377 --> 02:16:27.646
THE ANALYSIS OF MANY OF THE

02:16:27.712 --> 02:16:28.813
MAJOR DEVELOPERS TO BUILD

02:16:28.880 --> 02:16:29.648
HOUSING FOR THE FORMALLY

02:16:29.714 --> 02:16:31.716
HOMELESS -- FOR LOW INCOME

02:16:31.783 --> 02:16:33.852
FAMILIES FOR SENIOR CITIZENS FOR

02:16:33.919 --> 02:16:35.820
OTHER AFFECTED COMMUNITIES IS

02:16:35.887 --> 02:16:37.389
THAT CORRECT YES ON IT AS YOU

02:16:37.455 --> 02:16:39.124
SAY THIS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE

02:16:39.190 --> 02:16:40.725
ABLE TO BE MORE HELPFUL TO THOSE

02:16:40.792 --> 02:16:42.260
THAT WANT TO SEE MORE LOW INCOME

02:16:42.327 --> 02:16:44.095
HOUSING -- IN MORE COMMUNITIES

02:16:44.162 --> 02:16:46.231
BECAUSE OFTEN MARKET DEVELOPERS

02:16:46.298 --> 02:16:47.532
PAY THE KINDS OF FEES THAT HAVE

02:16:47.599 --> 02:16:48.833
BEEN A HALLMARK OF THIS

02:16:48.900 --> 02:16:49.534
CONVERSATION MOST OF THIS

02:16:49.601 --> 02:16:50.368
MORNING.

02:16:50.435 --> 02:16:51.469
THE GOING TO HOUSING TRUST FUNDS

02:16:51.536 --> 02:16:52.938
LIKE WHAT WE HAD IN SAN DIEGO

02:16:53.004 --> 02:16:54.372
WHICH COULD IN TWO THINGS ONE

02:16:54.439 --> 02:16:55.740
BILL MORE UNITS BUT THEN ALSO

02:16:55.807 --> 02:16:57.275
MAKE THEM HOPEFULLY MORE DEEPLY

02:16:57.342 --> 02:16:58.543
SUBSIDIZE SO YOU'RE NOT TALKING

02:16:58.610 --> 02:17:01.780
ABOUT. 80% A 100% 120% BUT MORE

02:17:01.846 --> 02:17:04.716
LIKE 30% OR 50% A AM I WHICH

02:17:04.783 --> 02:17:06.184
FRANKLY IS WHAT HARD WORKING

02:17:06.251 --> 02:17:08.086
PEOPLE EARN IN MANY PARTS OF OF

02:17:08.153 --> 02:17:08.720
SAN DIEGO.

02:17:08.787 --> 02:17:10.655
WHO CAN'T STILL FIND A PLACE TO

02:17:10.722 --> 02:17:12.390
LIVE I DON'T WANT OTHER ISSUE

02:17:12.457 --> 02:17:13.625
THAT WAS MENTIONED WAS RUN

02:17:13.692 --> 02:17:20.899
HISTORIC RESOURCES THE SYSTEM

02:17:20.966 --> 02:17:21.533
MEAN IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO

02:17:21.600 --> 02:17:22.434
ME?

02:17:22.500 --> 02:17:23.234
THIS BILL WOULD IN NO WAY --

02:17:23.301 --> 02:17:25.403
ELIMINATE OR MODIFY LOCAL A

02:17:25.470 --> 02:17:26.004
HISTORIC RESOURCES LEGISLATION

02:17:26.071 --> 02:17:27.839
ORDINANCES.

02:17:27.906 --> 02:17:29.174
IT DOES NOT SO IN OTHER WORDS

02:17:29.240 --> 02:17:30.375
YOU ARE CORRECT IT DOES NOT.

02:17:30.442 --> 02:17:31.142
IMPACT IF A LOCAL GOVERNMENT

02:17:31.209 --> 02:17:31.943
ALREADY HAS HISTORIC

02:17:32.010 --> 02:17:33.111
PRESERVATION ORDINANCE FOR

02:17:33.178 --> 02:17:34.245
EXAMPLE.

02:17:34.312 --> 02:17:35.680
OR THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DESIGN

02:17:35.747 --> 02:17:37.649
REVIEW STANDARDS OR IN THE CASE

02:17:37.716 --> 02:17:39.150
OF CERTAIN OF OUR COASTAL

02:17:39.217 --> 02:17:40.585
COMMUNITIES IF THEY HAVE COASTAL

02:17:40.652 --> 02:17:41.853
HEIGHT LIMITS.

02:17:41.920 --> 02:17:43.989
THIS BILL DOES NOT OVERTURN

02:17:44.055 --> 02:17:45.857
KNOWS OR INTERFERE WITH THOSE

02:17:45.924 --> 02:17:47.525
AND IN FACT WE EVEN PUT IN AN

02:17:47.592 --> 02:17:49.828
EXPLICIT AMENDMENT.

02:17:49.894 --> 02:17:51.997
THAT BECAUSE THERE WAS FEAR IN

02:17:52.063 --> 02:17:54.566
THERE WAS CAN THERE WAS A LOT OF

02:17:54.633 --> 02:17:56.034
MYTHS OUT THERE THAT THIS WOULD.

02:17:56.101 --> 02:17:58.003
OVERTURN COASTAL HEIGHT LIMITS

02:17:58.069 --> 02:18:00.205
AND SO WE PUT THAT LANGUAGE WE

02:18:00.271 --> 02:18:01.873
DID IT WE DIDN'T NEED TO MAKE

02:18:01.940 --> 02:18:03.141
THE LANGUAGE EXPLICIT BECAUSE IT

02:18:03.208 --> 02:18:05.443
ALREADY DIDN'T DO THAT BUT CHEST.

02:18:05.510 --> 02:18:08.113
BECAUSE PERCEPTION SO OFTEN.

02:18:08.179 --> 02:18:11.416
UNFORTUNATELY RULES THE DAY WE

02:18:11.483 --> 02:18:13.051
PUT EXPLICIT LANGUAGE IN.

02:18:13.118 --> 02:18:15.053
SO I APPRECIATE CLEAR FIND THAT --

02:18:15.120 --> 02:18:16.121
IT'S A DATE WITH A FORTY FIVE

02:18:16.187 --> 02:18:17.489
YEAR REVIEW FOR STRUCTURES THAT

02:18:17.555 --> 02:18:18.456
ARE OVER FORTY FIVE YEARS OLD

02:18:18.523 --> 02:18:18.957
THEY MUST GO TO A STORE

02:18:19.024 --> 02:18:19.924
RESOURCES BOARD FOR

02:18:19.991 --> 02:18:21.226
CONSIDERATION.

02:18:21.292 --> 02:18:22.861
IF TEAM TO STORE IT THAT OFTEN --

02:18:22.927 --> 02:18:23.995
IMPACTS THE WAY THAT THE

02:18:24.062 --> 02:18:25.664
PROPERTY MAY BE USED GOING

02:18:25.730 --> 02:18:27.298
FORWARD YOUR BILL WOULD NOT

02:18:27.365 --> 02:18:30.502
CHANGE CORRECT -- SO LASTLY I

02:18:30.568 --> 02:18:31.002
JUST WANT TO GET TO THE

02:18:31.069 --> 02:18:31.569
AMENDMENTS YOU ACCEPTING THE

02:18:31.636 --> 02:18:32.237
COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE IN

02:18:32.303 --> 02:18:34.873
THE ANALYSIS YOU MADE MENTION OF

02:18:34.939 --> 02:18:36.074
TOUCH.

02:18:36.141 --> 02:18:37.375
I BELIEVE THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS --

02:18:37.442 --> 02:18:38.009
INSIDE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ARE

02:18:38.076 --> 02:18:39.377
INCLUSIVE OF REMOVING THE

02:18:39.444 --> 02:18:40.211
SECTION ABOUT SUBSTANDARD

02:18:40.278 --> 02:18:42.681
HOUSING YEAH WITH REGARD -- TO

02:18:42.747 --> 02:18:44.683
CODE COMPLIANCE YES -- BECAUSE

02:18:44.749 --> 02:18:45.517
THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT I COULD

02:18:45.583 --> 02:18:47.619
NOT HAVE SUPPORTED -- ANY SORT

02:18:47.686 --> 02:18:48.586
OF ALLOWING OF SLOW MORE SIXTEEN

02:18:48.653 --> 02:18:50.689
OPERATE -- I THINK THE PROCESS

02:18:50.755 --> 02:18:51.890
IS FAR TOO SUBJECTIVE ALREADY

02:18:51.956 --> 02:18:52.490
ACTING FRANKLY THAT'S HOW IT

02:18:52.557 --> 02:18:53.692
KIND OF WORKS BUT EXPLICITLY

02:18:53.758 --> 02:18:55.093
STATING THAT FROM THE STATE

02:18:55.160 --> 02:18:55.727
WOULD NOT BE SOMETHING I COULD

02:18:55.794 --> 02:18:57.228
SUPPORT.

02:18:57.295 --> 02:18:58.129
THAT WAS A SUGGESTED COMMITTEE

02:18:58.196 --> 02:18:59.931
AMENDMENT THAT SOMETHING YOU'RE

02:18:59.998 --> 02:19:01.066
ACCEPTING SO THAT'S DONE THE

02:19:01.132 --> 02:19:01.700
REMAINING TWO THINGS WERE VERY

02:19:01.766 --> 02:19:02.600
IMPORTANT TO ME AND I WANT TO

02:19:02.667 --> 02:19:04.302
THANK YOU SENATOR FOR HEARING

02:19:04.369 --> 02:19:04.869
OUT THE CONCERNS.

02:19:04.936 --> 02:19:06.738
THAT I VOICE ON BEHALF OF MY

02:19:06.805 --> 02:19:07.672
CONSTITUENTS -- YOU MENTION THE

02:19:07.739 --> 02:19:08.807
PARKING REQUIREMENT YOU'RE

02:19:08.873 --> 02:19:10.108

02:19:10.175 --> 02:19:11.976
CAN YOU STATE ON THE RECORD WHAT

02:19:12.043 --> 02:19:12.610
SECTION THAT IS THAT YOU INTEND

02:19:12.677 --> 02:19:13.445

02:19:13.511 --> 02:19:21.519
WE WILL BE DELETING [inaudible]

02:19:21.586 --> 02:19:22.487
IT IS [inaudible]

02:19:22.554 --> 02:19:24.022
BE.

02:19:24.089 --> 02:19:24.589
ONE AND THE ONE IS ALL THE

02:19:24.656 --> 02:19:25.757
REFERENCE TO THE LIFTING OF

02:19:25.824 --> 02:19:28.993
PARKING MINIMUMS AND THE AT THAT

02:19:29.060 --> 02:19:29.928
THERE WOULD.

02:19:29.994 --> 02:19:33.631
ONLY BE ALLOWED A POINT FIVE

02:19:33.698 --> 02:19:36.401

02:19:37.769 --> 02:19:38.269
DELETED.

02:19:38.336 --> 02:19:39.738
AND SO IN A COMMUNITY LIKE MINE

02:19:39.804 --> 02:19:41.239
IN SAN DIEGO IN THE CITY SAN

02:19:41.306 --> 02:19:43.074
DIEGO WHERE THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A

02:19:43.141 --> 02:19:43.975
PARKING MINIMUMS.

02:19:44.042 --> 02:19:45.910
BY DOING THAT THE LOCAL RULE

02:19:45.977 --> 02:19:48.613
STILL APPLIES SO WHAT -- IS

02:19:48.680 --> 02:19:49.481
APPLICABLE IN SOLANA BEACH WHICH

02:19:49.547 --> 02:19:50.915
I'M GONNA REPRESENTING WOULD

02:19:50.982 --> 02:19:52.951
REMAIN WHAT HAPPENS ANY CITY SAN

02:19:53.017 --> 02:19:55.086
DIEGO WOULD REMAIN THE BILL

02:19:55.153 --> 02:19:55.720
WOULD NO LONGER TOUCH THAT YES

02:19:55.787 --> 02:19:56.387

02:19:56.454 --> 02:19:58.223
CITY AFFECTED OR COMMUNITY

02:19:58.289 --> 02:19:59.357
AFFECTED BY THE BILL.

02:19:59.424 --> 02:20:01.793
THAT HAS A REQUIRED MARKING

02:20:01.860 --> 02:20:04.429
PARKING MINIMUM EVEN IF THAT

02:20:04.496 --> 02:20:06.698
REQUIRED PARKING MINIMUM IS A

02:20:06.765 --> 02:20:08.199
QUARTER MILE FROM MERRILL STOP

02:20:08.266 --> 02:20:09.734
WHICH IS ALL THE BILL HAD IN

02:20:09.801 --> 02:20:11.102
THERE BUT WHATEVER EVEN IF IT

02:20:11.169 --> 02:20:12.137
HAD THAT.

02:20:12.203 --> 02:20:15.774
WITH THE DELETION OF THAT

02:20:15.840 --> 02:20:17.308
SECTION.

02:20:17.375 --> 02:20:17.976
IN ALL.

02:20:18.042 --> 02:20:19.177
COMMUNITIES EXISTING PARKING

02:20:19.244 --> 02:20:22.180
MINIMUMS WOULD REMAIN THE SAME.

02:20:22.247 --> 02:20:24.983
AND AS I MENTIONED MY INTENT FOR

02:20:25.049 --> 02:20:26.718
TRYING TO LIFT PARKING MINIMUMS

02:20:26.785 --> 02:20:28.620
WASN'T TO PROHIBIT PARKING IF

02:20:30.355 --> 02:20:30.822
TO INCLUDE PARKING I'VE NO

02:20:30.889 --> 02:20:31.956
PROBLEM WITH THAT.

02:20:32.023 --> 02:20:34.192
IT WAS TO HELP REDUCE COSTS OF

02:20:34.259 --> 02:20:35.727
MARKET RATE BECAUSE PARKING

02:20:35.794 --> 02:20:38.630
GREATLY THREE INCREASES THE COST.

02:20:38.696 --> 02:20:40.932
BUT BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF

02:20:40.999 --> 02:20:43.468
OPPOSITION AND BECAUSE I DIDN'T

02:20:43.535 --> 02:20:45.069
WANT TO AS THEY SAY THROW THE

I'M WILLING TO DELETE IT AND WE

02:20:52.544 --> 02:20:54.012

02:20:54.078 --> 02:20:55.180
TAKEN OUT AMENDMENT AND DELETING

SO ON THE BILL THE LOCAL

02:21:09.294 --> 02:21:10.662
GOVERNMENTS WOULD CONTINUE TO BE

02:21:10.728 --> 02:21:12.430
LIMITED IN THEIR ABILITY TO DOWN

02:21:12.497 --> 02:21:14.833
ZONE IF THEY HAVE THAT PROVISION

02:21:14.899 --> 02:21:16.201
ALREADY THERE ARE SOME.

02:21:16.267 --> 02:21:19.270

AND THE BILL ORIGINALLY.

02:21:31.883 --> 02:21:33.251

WRITTEN TO TAKE EFFECT FOR TEN

02:21:35.286 --> 02:21:37.021
YEARS AND BECAUSE WE'RE IN A

02:21:37.088 --> 02:21:38.423
CRISIS IT WAS.

02:21:45.763 --> 02:21:48.666
AND YOU KNOW JUST FOR A LIMITED

02:21:48.733 --> 02:21:50.869
TIME SUSPENDING SOME THINGS.

02:21:50.935 --> 02:21:52.971

02:21:53.037 --> 02:21:56.674
REACTION TO THE SUSPENSION OF A

FIVE YEARS.

02:22:01.746 --> 02:22:02.947
AND OF COURSE AS WE KNOW THE

02:22:03.014 --> 02:22:05.516
PERIOD OF TIME IT TAKES TO GET

02:22:05.583 --> 02:22:06.951
SOMETHING ON A BIT FOR FIRST A

02:22:07.018 --> 02:22:08.219
LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO ACT AND

02:22:08.286 --> 02:22:09.554
SECONDARILY SOMETHING TO GET ON

02:22:09.621 --> 02:22:11.322
THE BALLOT.

02:22:11.389 --> 02:22:13.358
THE LIKELIHOOD OF VOTER APPROVAL

02:22:13.424 --> 02:22:15.727
EVEN BEING RELEVANT IN THE FIVE

02:22:15.793 --> 02:22:17.962
YEAR PERIOD IS LOW SO IT WAS

02:22:18.029 --> 02:22:21.099
EASY FOR ME TO TO JUST. TO LEAD

02:22:21.165 --> 02:22:23.835
THAT AND I WILL BE TAKING THAT

02:22:23.902 --> 02:22:25.236
AMENDMENT THAT WOULD TO LEAD

02:22:25.303 --> 02:22:27.772
SECTION F..

02:22:27.839 --> 02:22:29.574
ONE WHICH AGAIN SUSPENSE THE

02:22:29.641 --> 02:22:31.009
VOTER APPROVAL OFFICIAL THAT

02:22:31.075 --> 02:22:32.110
WOULD BE GONE APPRECIATING

02:22:32.176 --> 02:22:33.278
SPECIFICALLY JUST TO DRAW A

02:22:33.344 --> 02:22:33.878
LITTLE BIT DEEPER BECAUSE YOU

02:22:33.945 --> 02:22:36.281
KNOW IN SAN DIEGO WE HAVE

02:22:36.347 --> 02:22:37.882
EXTREME INTEREST IN COSTA HEIGHT

02:22:37.949 --> 02:22:39.317
LIMITS YES -- AND YOU HAD

02:22:39.384 --> 02:22:41.019
PREVIOUSLY BEEN CLEAR ON THE

02:22:41.085 --> 02:22:43.154
SENATE SIDE ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL

02:22:43.221 --> 02:22:44.489
WOULD AND WOULD NOT DO THERE

02:22:44.555 --> 02:22:45.857
CONTINUES TO BE A PERCEPTION

02:22:45.924 --> 02:22:47.358
THAT THIS BILL WHILE IT WOULD

02:22:47.425 --> 02:22:49.727
PROHIBIT -- WHAT WOULD NOT

02:22:49.794 --> 02:22:50.295
REMOVE THE COSTA HAD LIMITED

02:22:50.361 --> 02:22:52.563
VOTERS ENACTED MANY YEARS AGO

02:22:52.630 --> 02:22:53.998
RIGHT BUT IT THE BILL TO THE

02:22:54.065 --> 02:22:54.565
MINUTE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:22:54.632 --> 02:22:56.434
TODAY IT ALSO PRECLUDE THE CITY

02:22:56.501 --> 02:22:58.136
COUNCIL BY A MAJORITY VOTE? FOR

02:22:58.202 --> 02:23:00.371
OVERTURNING THE THE CITIZENS

02:23:00.438 --> 02:23:04.142
EFFORTS WITH REGARD TO COST

02:23:04.208 --> 02:23:05.977
ISLAND THE ONLY REASON.

02:23:06.044 --> 02:23:07.145
SO LET ME I AM NOT HEDGING ON

02:23:07.211 --> 02:23:08.746
THAT AT ALL IT'S JUST THAT EVERY

02:23:08.813 --> 02:23:09.981
CITY HAT AND EVERY.

02:23:10.048 --> 02:23:12.583
SO SOME JURISDICTIONS HAVE VOTER

02:23:12.650 --> 02:23:14.719
INITIATIVES THAT RESTRICT THEIR

02:23:14.786 --> 02:23:16.554
ABILITY TO DO SOMETHING SOME DO

02:23:16.621 --> 02:23:18.356
NOT RIGHT SO IF I HAPPEN TO BE

02:23:18.423 --> 02:23:19.791
IN A CITY WHERE THERE'S NO VOTER

02:23:19.857 --> 02:23:20.925
RESTRICTION.

02:23:20.992 --> 02:23:22.360
ON WHAT MY CITY CAN DO BY

02:23:22.427 --> 02:23:24.095
MAJORITY VOTE THIS BILL DOES NOT

02:23:24.162 --> 02:23:26.264
INTERFERE WITH ANY OF THE

02:23:26.331 --> 02:23:27.465
EXISTING RULES.

02:23:27.532 --> 02:23:29.334
IF THE CITY.

02:23:29.400 --> 02:23:31.069
HAS ALREADY.

02:23:31.135 --> 02:23:33.071
VOTER INITIATIVE THAT DOES NOT

02:23:33.137 --> 02:23:34.572
ALLOW THEM TO CHANGE SOMETHING

02:23:34.639 --> 02:23:36.641
MY MAJORITY VOTE THAT IS

02:23:36.708 --> 02:23:38.576
PRESERVED IN RETAINED THIS BILL

02:23:38.643 --> 02:23:40.044
DOES NOT TOUCH THAT.

02:23:40.111 --> 02:23:41.346
BUT IF COURSE IF THERE IS

02:23:41.412 --> 02:23:43.381
ANOTHER CITY THAT CAN CHANGE

02:23:43.448 --> 02:23:44.449
SOMETHING BY MAJORITY VOTE

02:23:44.515 --> 02:23:46.551
BECAUSE THIS DOES NOT INTERFERE

02:23:46.617 --> 02:23:47.919
WITH WHATTHE CITY CAN DO.

02:23:47.986 --> 02:23:49.721
THEY MAY BE ABLE TO DO THAT I

02:23:49.787 --> 02:23:50.488
UNDERSTAND THE NUANCE OF WHAT

02:23:50.555 --> 02:23:52.056
YOU'RE SAYING IF THE VOTERS

02:23:52.123 --> 02:23:53.992
APPROVED A MEASURE SAYING THEIR

02:23:54.058 --> 02:23:55.226
BABY MAY BE NO HEIGHT.

02:23:55.293 --> 02:23:56.327
THOUGH CONSTRUCTION BE ON A

02:23:56.394 --> 02:23:57.528
THIRTY FOOT HEIGHT LIMIT.

02:23:57.595 --> 02:23:59.030
NO EXCEPTIONS THIS BILL WILL NOT

02:23:59.097 --> 02:24:00.698
CHANGED CORRECT ABSOLUTELY

02:24:00.765 --> 02:24:02.100
CORRECT THANK YOU I WANT TO JUST

02:24:02.166 --> 02:24:03.167
WIND UP BY SAYING.

02:24:03.234 --> 02:24:04.402
THAT I APPRECIATE THE

02:24:04.469 --> 02:24:05.770
MISCONCEPTIONS WITH THE BILL

02:24:05.837 --> 02:24:06.804
OBVIOUSLY WE DEALT WITH SOME

02:24:06.871 --> 02:24:08.072
PRETTY HEAVY LEGISLATION IN THIS

02:24:08.139 --> 02:24:09.474
SESSION I DO THINK BASED ON SOME

02:24:09.540 --> 02:24:10.908
THE INDIVIDUAL CONVERSATIONS

02:24:10.975 --> 02:24:11.676
I'VE HAD WITH CONSTITUENTS IN

02:24:11.743 --> 02:24:12.310
OTHERS.

02:24:12.377 --> 02:24:13.711
THIS BILL IS OFTEN CONFLATED

02:24:13.778 --> 02:24:15.947
ESSENTIALLY WHAT THIS DOES IS IT

02:24:16.014 --> 02:24:17.482
GIVES A TIME LINE FOR ANY

02:24:17.548 --> 02:24:19.217
APPLICANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE

02:24:19.283 --> 02:24:21.252
THEIR DAY IN COURT IF YOU WILL.

02:24:21.319 --> 02:24:23.388
THIS BILL IN NO WAY MANDATES

02:24:23.454 --> 02:24:24.956
THAT LOCAL DECISION MAKERS MUST

02:24:25.023 --> 02:24:26.724
OF A PERMIT A PARTICULAR PROJECT

02:24:26.791 --> 02:24:28.559
THEY MAY IS PERMITTED AS MUCH AS

02:24:28.626 --> 02:24:29.394
THEY MAY DENY IT.

02:24:29.460 --> 02:24:30.928
AROUND THE DIFFERENCE IS A

02:24:30.995 --> 02:24:32.930
CERTAINTY OF TIMING AND WRITING

02:24:32.997 --> 02:24:34.065
T. OF COST YEAH I THINK THOSE

02:24:34.132 --> 02:24:35.066
TWO THINGS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT

02:24:35.133 --> 02:24:36.567
THAT THE RULES DO NOT CHANGE

02:24:36.634 --> 02:24:38.002
DURING THE PROCESS OF THE

02:24:38.069 --> 02:24:39.837
APPLICATION BEING ANALYZED I

02:24:39.904 --> 02:24:40.571
THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT

02:24:40.638 --> 02:24:41.639
VERTICALLY AS SOMEONE WHO SPENT

02:24:41.706 --> 02:24:42.740
HIS PROFESSIONAL CAREER WORKING

02:24:42.807 --> 02:24:42.907
IN.

02:24:42.974 --> 02:24:44.308
AFFORDABLE HOUSING AS A FORMER

02:24:44.375 --> 02:24:45.910
HOUSING COMMISSIONER I RECOGNIZE

02:24:45.977 --> 02:24:47.311
THAT THERE ARE APPLICATION

02:24:47.378 --> 02:24:48.479
PROCESS SEES WE'RE DEVELOPERS

02:24:48.546 --> 02:24:50.148
ARE SEEKING TO BUILD HOUSING FOR

02:24:50.214 --> 02:24:51.115
THE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR

02:24:51.182 --> 02:24:52.383
COMMUNITIES MUST APPLY THEY

02:24:52.450 --> 02:24:53.718
SOMETIMES ARE ANNUAL OR SEMI

02:24:53.785 --> 02:24:54.519
ANNUAL.

02:24:54.585 --> 02:24:56.320
IF YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE

02:24:56.387 --> 02:24:56.888
YOU MISS SEPTIC AROUND THE

02:24:56.954 --> 02:24:58.656
FUNDING AND YOU MUST WAIT FOR

02:24:58.723 --> 02:25:00.358
THE NEXT ONE BUT IN THE MEANTIME

02:25:00.425 --> 02:25:01.959
FEES IN A CONSTRUCTION COST OF

02:25:02.026 --> 02:25:04.295
CHANGE THAT MAY MAKE A PROJECT

02:25:04.362 --> 02:25:05.430
THAT STUFF'S GOING TO GET SOME

02:25:05.496 --> 02:25:05.663
AWARD.

02:25:05.730 --> 02:25:07.231
BE IN FEASIBLE WHAT THAT MEANS

02:25:07.298 --> 02:25:08.232
IS THERE'S FEWER HOMES AT PRICES

02:25:08.299 --> 02:25:09.233
THAT PEOPLE COULD ACTUALLY

02:25:09.300 --> 02:25:11.502
AFFORD I THINK THAT THIS BROUGHT

02:25:11.569 --> 02:25:12.537
THIS BILL AND DID EXTENT THAT'LL

02:25:12.603 --> 02:25:14.505
HELP FACILITATE -- BUT PROCESS

02:25:14.572 --> 02:25:16.207
FOR SUBSIDIZED HOUSING PROJECTS

02:25:16.274 --> 02:25:17.575
TO PROCEED I THINK IS BRILLIANT

02:25:17.642 --> 02:25:18.810
I'M I'M NOT SO ESPECIALLY

02:25:18.876 --> 02:25:20.078
CONCERNED WITH MARKET RATE

02:25:20.144 --> 02:25:21.412
DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE GUESS WHAT

02:25:21.479 --> 02:25:22.280
THE BANKS WILL STILL BE THERE

02:25:22.346 --> 02:25:23.281
THEY DON'T HAVE FUNDING MOUNT

02:25:23.347 --> 02:25:24.649
THEY DON'T HAVE DEADLINES.

02:25:24.715 --> 02:25:26.050
THEY WILL ALWAYS BE THERE AND

02:25:26.117 --> 02:25:26.818
CERTAINLY WITH MARKET RATE

02:25:26.884 --> 02:25:27.919
DEVELOPMENT PEOPLE ALWAYS FIND A

02:25:27.985 --> 02:25:35.059
WAY RIGHT BUT I THINK WHAT

02:25:35.126 --> 02:25:36.661
YOU'RE PROVIDING HERE IS THIS IN

02:25:36.727 --> 02:25:37.228
T. OF PROCESS THAT FRANKLY

02:25:37.295 --> 02:25:38.162
SHOULD BE THERE REGARDLESS OF

02:25:38.229 --> 02:25:38.696
WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE IN A

02:25:38.763 --> 02:25:39.097
HOUSING CRISIS.

02:25:39.163 --> 02:25:39.764
PEOPLE DESERVE A STRAIGHT ANSWER

02:25:39.831 --> 02:25:40.565
ABOUT WHAT SOMETHING IS GOING TO

02:25:40.631 --> 02:25:41.399
COST AND HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE

02:25:41.466 --> 02:25:42.900
THAT IS TRUE FOR MISTER WOULD

02:25:42.967 --> 02:25:44.035
SENATOR WHITE HOUSE USE A MOMENT

02:25:44.102 --> 02:25:45.002
AGO DOING ADDITION TO HIS HOUSE.

02:25:45.069 --> 02:25:46.070
TO SOMEBODY'S GONNA MASTER PLAN

02:25:46.137 --> 02:25:46.938
DEVELOPMENT OVER SOMEBODY'S

02:25:47.004 --> 02:25:48.339
DOING AN INFILL DEVELOPMENT THAT

02:25:48.406 --> 02:25:48.940
WILL GET HOMELESS PEOPLE OFFER

02:25:49.006 --> 02:25:49.173
STREET.

02:25:49.240 --> 02:25:49.774
I THINK THAT MAKES A LOT OF

02:25:49.841 --> 02:25:51.676
SENSE I'M ANXIOUS TO SEE IF THIS

02:25:51.742 --> 02:25:53.478
IS ENACTED HOW IT WORKS BUT I

02:25:53.544 --> 02:25:54.479
SUSPECT THAT WHEN YOU TELL

02:25:54.545 --> 02:25:55.513
PEOPLE WHAT SOMETHING'S GONNA

02:25:55.580 --> 02:25:57.348
COST AND HOW LONG IT'LL TAKE.

02:25:57.415 --> 02:25:58.282
IT IS MORE LIKELY THAT MORE

02:25:58.349 --> 02:25:59.617
HOMES WILL GET BILL AND TO THE

02:25:59.684 --> 02:26:00.651
EXTENT THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:26:00.718 --> 02:26:02.053
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PRIORITY

02:26:02.120 --> 02:26:02.954
LIST IN TERMS OF WHO CAN

02:26:03.020 --> 02:26:04.255
ACTUALLY SUCCESSFULLY PENCIL

02:26:04.322 --> 02:26:05.623
PROJECT.

02:26:05.690 --> 02:26:06.858
IS AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS

02:26:06.924 --> 02:26:08.025
AND BY GOD WE SHOULD HELP THEM

02:26:08.092 --> 02:26:09.494
SO -- I APPRECIATE THE

02:26:09.560 --> 02:26:11.429
AMENDMENTS I KNOW YOU'RE TAKING

02:26:11.496 --> 02:26:12.230
THOSE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SOME A

02:26:12.296 --> 02:26:13.264
STATE VERY CLEARLY RIGHT NOW IF

02:26:13.331 --> 02:26:14.398
THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN FOR SOME ODD

02:26:14.465 --> 02:26:15.666
REASON YOUR WOMAN OF YOUR WORD

02:26:15.733 --> 02:26:17.502
BUT I KNOW IF IT DOESN'T HAPPEN.

02:26:17.568 --> 02:26:22.740

02:26:23.407 --> 02:26:23.975
BILL TODAY.

THE BILL DOES A REALLY

02:26:29.847 --> 02:26:31.315
APPRECIATE IT AND I THINK AS WE

02:26:31.382 --> 02:26:32.083

02:26:32.150 --> 02:26:34.418
VERY COMMONLY IS LEGISLATORS WE

02:26:34.485 --> 02:26:36.888
ARE APPROACHED BY WAY ANY ENTITY

02:26:36.954 --> 02:26:38.089
WHETHER IT'S LOCAL GOVERNMENT

THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING SO I

02:26:57.208 --> 02:26:57.942

02:26:58.009 --> 02:26:58.910
BILL IS TRYING TO DO AND I

02:28:28.099 --> 02:28:29.634

IN LARGE PARTS OF THE STATE --

02:28:55.493 --> 02:28:56.027
AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING

02:28:56.093 --> 02:28:57.595
THAT LOCALITIES ARE GONNA NEED

02:28:57.662 --> 02:28:58.963

I THINK THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

02:30:45.936 --> 02:30:47.772
MIS CHARACTERIZATIONS ABOUT THIS

02:30:47.838 --> 02:30:49.774

02:31:07.124 --> 02:31:07.691
ABOUT.

02:31:07.758 --> 02:31:09.160
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THIS IS A

02:31:09.226 --> 02:31:11.562
BILL ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT

02:31:11.629 --> 02:31:13.230
DURING THE WORST HOUSING CRISIS

02:31:13.297 --> 02:31:14.865
IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY CITIES

02:31:14.932 --> 02:31:16.767

I WANT TO CLARIFY TWO DIFFERENT

02:33:31.035 --> 02:33:32.403
POINTS I KNOW MY COLLEAGUE FROM

02:33:32.469 --> 02:33:34.038
SAN DIEGO -- WENT THROUGH SOME

02:33:34.104 --> 02:33:35.906
OF THE CONCERNS THAT I SHARED AS

02:33:35.973 --> 02:33:36.574
WELL BUT THERE'S TWO OTHER

02:33:36.640 --> 02:33:37.741
CONCERNS THAT A PRODUCT THAT I'M

02:33:37.808 --> 02:33:39.977
HOPING THAT YOU CAN RESPOND TO

02:33:40.044 --> 02:33:42.212
ONE IS THERE -- A IN OPPOSITION

02:33:42.279 --> 02:33:43.781
COMMENT THERE WAS SOME CONCERN

02:33:43.847 --> 02:33:44.949
THAT THIS COULD CONFLICT WITH

02:33:45.015 --> 02:33:46.250
THE COASTAL ACT AND I JUST

02:33:46.317 --> 02:33:47.985
WANTED TO HEAR YOUR RESPONSE --

02:33:48.052 --> 02:33:50.287
AND YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHETHER OR

02:33:50.354 --> 02:33:51.322
NOT THIS COULD CONFLICT WITH THE

02:33:51.388 --> 02:33:52.856
COSTA ACT WHICH IS OF COURSE

02:33:52.923 --> 02:33:54.425
IMPORTANT IN OUR STATE.

02:33:54.491 --> 02:33:56.060
THERE IS NOTHING IN THE BILL

02:33:56.126 --> 02:33:57.361
THAT WOULD CONFLICT WITH THE

02:33:57.428 --> 02:33:59.096
COASTAL ACT AND IN FACT IT WOULD

02:33:59.163 --> 02:34:00.664
HAVE TO BE FOR ME TO PUT

02:34:00.731 --> 02:34:02.066
ANYTHING IN THE BILL. TO

02:34:02.132 --> 02:34:03.701
CONFLICT WITH THE COASTAL ACT

02:34:03.767 --> 02:34:05.169
WOULD REQUIRE IT WOULD HAVE TO

02:34:05.235 --> 02:34:07.504
BILL KEYED AS A TWO THIRDS VOTE

02:34:07.571 --> 02:34:08.572
BECAUSE THE COASTAL ACTORS

02:34:08.639 --> 02:34:09.773
OBVIOUSLY VOTER APPROVED

02:34:09.840 --> 02:34:11.075
INITIATIVE.

02:34:11.141 --> 02:34:13.243
SO THAT THAT JUST HELPS YOU KNOW

02:34:13.310 --> 02:34:15.112
NEED TO TAKE MY WORD ALONE BUT

02:34:15.179 --> 02:34:16.880
THAT AS IT IS NOT KEY TO TWO

02:34:16.947 --> 02:34:18.749
THIRDS VOTE IT HAS NOTHING IN IT

02:34:18.816 --> 02:34:20.417
THAT IN ANY WAY INTERFERES WITH

02:34:20.484 --> 02:34:22.553
ANY -- STATEWIDE VOTER

02:34:22.620 --> 02:34:24.488
INITIATIVES THANK YOU AND THE

02:34:24.555 --> 02:34:26.557
SECOND PIECE IS A AS A DISTRICT

02:34:26.624 --> 02:34:29.026
THAT'S BEEN IMPACTED BY NATURAL

02:34:29.093 --> 02:34:31.128
DISASTERS -- A BAY AND ALSO

02:34:31.195 --> 02:34:33.030
THAT'S AYE HAS HOUSING -- IN THE

02:34:33.097 --> 02:34:35.199
COASTAL AREA WE SEE EROSION AND

02:34:35.265 --> 02:34:37.568
CLIFFS -- CAN YOU JUST SPEAK TO

02:34:37.635 --> 02:34:39.303
THE PROTECTIONS IN PLACE IN THIS

02:34:39.370 --> 02:34:42.206
BILL -- FOR SOME OF THESE AREAS --

02:34:42.272 --> 02:34:43.674
I KNOW ONE OF THE CONCERNS

02:34:43.741 --> 02:34:44.508
EYEBROWS LIKE WILD THE

02:34:44.575 --> 02:34:46.043
TOPOGRAPHY HAS CHANGED -- IN

02:34:46.110 --> 02:34:47.411
SOME OF THESE AREAS AND THEY

02:34:47.478 --> 02:34:49.513
CAN'T REPLACE -- THE STOCK IN

02:34:49.580 --> 02:34:51.148
THAT PARTICULAR AREA BUT CAN YOU

02:34:51.215 --> 02:34:53.017
JUST SPEAK TO THIS AND HOW THIS

02:34:53.083 --> 02:34:56.153
MITIGATES SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS --

02:34:56.220 --> 02:34:59.189
FOR COMMUNITIES CERTAINLY SO.

02:34:59.256 --> 02:35:00.791
JUST LET'S USE FIRE FOR A MOMENT

02:35:00.858 --> 02:35:03.027
AS AN EXAMPLE SO WE HEAR NOW

02:35:03.093 --> 02:35:08.699
VERY MUCH DISCUSSION AROUND THE

02:35:08.766 --> 02:35:10.701
WE WE WHICH IS THAT URBAN.

02:35:10.768 --> 02:35:11.468
WILDLAND INTERFACE WHICH IS

02:35:11.535 --> 02:35:13.303
WHERE SOME OF OUR FIRES START.

02:35:13.370 --> 02:35:15.305
AND THERE IS SOME CONCERN THAT.

02:35:15.372 --> 02:35:16.774
ARE THE VERY FACT THAT MANY OF

02:35:16.840 --> 02:35:18.075
OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE

02:35:18.142 --> 02:35:20.344
ALLOWED FOR DEVELOPMENT IN THE

02:35:20.411 --> 02:35:23.447
WE WE HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE

02:35:23.514 --> 02:35:25.215
INCREASE OUR SEVERITY OF FIRES

02:35:25.282 --> 02:35:26.950
OR AT LEAST THE LOSS OF HOUSING

02:35:27.017 --> 02:35:27.551
DUE TO FIRES.

02:35:27.618 --> 02:35:30.854
SO NOW WHAT'S INTERESTING IS --

02:35:30.921 --> 02:35:32.690
MOST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN

02:35:32.756 --> 02:35:35.159
RESPONSE TO A FIRE IN IT WHO WE

02:35:35.225 --> 02:35:37.728
WE áREA HAVE NOT CHOSEN TO

02:35:37.795 --> 02:35:39.697
CHANGE THE ZONING OF THAT AREA

02:35:39.763 --> 02:35:42.366
THEY HAVE PRIMARILY ALLOWED. FOR

02:35:42.433 --> 02:35:44.301
THE REBUILDING **** I WAS ON

02:35:44.368 --> 02:35:45.369
THEIR BERKELEY CITY COUNCIL

02:35:45.436 --> 02:35:46.503
DURING THE OAKLAND BERKELEY

02:35:46.570 --> 02:35:48.138
TUNNEL FIRE WHICH PRIOR TO THE

02:35:48.205 --> 02:35:51.108
COFFEE FIRE IN THE PARADISE WAS

02:35:51.175 --> 02:35:51.608
V..

02:35:51.675 --> 02:35:53.077
HI WORST FIRE IN CALIFORNIA'S

02:35:53.143 --> 02:35:54.745
HISTORY IN TERMS OF LOSS OF

02:35:54.812 --> 02:35:58.015
UNITS -- BUT WE DID NOT DENOUNCE

02:35:58.082 --> 02:36:00.751
OWN IT WHATSOEVER AND ALLOWED.

02:36:00.818 --> 02:36:02.119
FOR THE JURISDICTION THAT YOU

02:36:02.186 --> 02:36:04.722
KNOW TO TO REBUILD NOW THERE IS

02:36:04.788 --> 02:36:06.323
SOME I SAY ALL THAT BECAUSE SOME

02:36:06.390 --> 02:36:07.825
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE THINKING

02:36:07.891 --> 02:36:10.027
ABOUT WHETHER THEY WOULD MODIFY.

02:36:10.094 --> 02:36:11.462
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO ADD MORE

02:36:11.528 --> 02:36:13.097
PROTECTIONS THERE'S NOTHING IN

02:36:13.163 --> 02:36:14.498
THIS BILL THAT WOULD PREVENT

02:36:14.565 --> 02:36:15.799
THEM FROM DOING SO.

02:36:15.866 --> 02:36:18.001
AND THE ONLY THING IN THIS BILLS

02:36:18.068 --> 02:36:21.371
IT RESTATES EXISTING STATUTE

02:36:21.438 --> 02:36:24.041
WHICH IS THE NO NET LOSS.

02:36:24.108 --> 02:36:25.375
IN THE NO NET LOSS OWNING SAYS

02:36:25.442 --> 02:36:26.744
IF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CHANGES

02:36:26.810 --> 02:36:27.878
THEIR ZONING.

02:36:27.945 --> 02:36:30.114
IF THEY YOU KNOW REDUCE THE

02:36:30.180 --> 02:36:31.348
DENSITY WHERE THEY'VE ALREADY

02:36:31.415 --> 02:36:33.150
ALLOWED A CERTAIN AMOUNT THAT

02:36:33.217 --> 02:36:34.818
THEY WOULD JUST HAVE.

02:36:34.885 --> 02:36:39.189
TO REPLACE IT ELSEWHERE IN THEIR

02:36:39.256 --> 02:36:40.057
COMMUNITY.

02:36:40.124 --> 02:36:40.824
SO WOULD NOT PREVENT THEM FROM

02:36:40.891 --> 02:36:42.593
EITHER LIMITING COASTAL FOR FOR

02:36:42.659 --> 02:36:43.494
EROSION PURPOSES LIMITING

02:36:43.560 --> 02:36:44.728
COASTAL DEVELOPMENT OR LIMITING

02:36:44.795 --> 02:36:46.263
WILL BE DEVELOPMENT AND AT THE

02:36:46.330 --> 02:36:47.931
SAME TIME STILL KEEP IN PLACE

02:36:47.998 --> 02:36:48.799
THAT WE'RE NOT LOSING GROUND IN

02:36:48.866 --> 02:36:50.367
STOCK AND YES AREAS THAT ARE

02:36:50.434 --> 02:36:52.002
HARD TO FIND PERFECT -- I I

02:36:52.069 --> 02:36:53.036
APPRECIATE HOW MUCH YOU'VE

02:36:53.103 --> 02:36:54.338
WORKED AT THIS AGAIN I THINK

02:36:54.404 --> 02:36:56.140
COLLEAGUES HAVE SHARED THIS -- I

02:36:56.206 --> 02:36:57.741
WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS TODAY --

02:36:57.808 --> 02:37:00.010
AND AGAIN THIS IS NOT EASY THIS

02:37:00.077 --> 02:37:01.979
LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED I JUST IN

02:37:02.045 --> 02:37:03.881
MY THREE YEARS HERE -- A HUNDRED

02:37:03.947 --> 02:37:05.449
AND THIRTY SEVEN A HOUSING BILLS

02:37:05.516 --> 02:37:07.217
ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE AND NONE OF

02:37:07.284 --> 02:37:08.752
THEM ARE THE PERFECT.

02:37:08.819 --> 02:37:10.754
ANSWER TO ANY OF THIS A THING TO

02:37:10.821 --> 02:37:12.756
THOSE -- IN OPPOSITION IS

02:37:12.823 --> 02:37:14.124
PARTICULAR TRADE TENANT GROUPS

02:37:14.191 --> 02:37:15.526
WE CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITH

02:37:15.592 --> 02:37:16.627
TRYING TO IDENTIFY WHAT TO DO

02:37:16.693 --> 02:37:17.961
BUT I THINK THE NUMBER OF BILLS

02:37:18.028 --> 02:37:20.063
WE HAVE SHOWS THAT THERE'S NOT

02:37:20.130 --> 02:37:21.265
ONE BILL THAT SOLVES AT ALL --

02:37:21.331 --> 02:37:22.432
AND SO WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE GOING

02:37:22.499 --> 02:37:25.369
TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS SO

02:37:25.435 --> 02:37:30.808
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

02:37:30.874 --> 02:37:35.546
WITH SO QUIRK SILVA.

02:37:35.612 --> 02:37:36.647
I WON'T BE REDUNDANT BUT SAY

02:37:36.713 --> 02:37:39.283
THAT AGAIN JUST THIS YEAR BEING

02:37:39.349 --> 02:37:41.485
ON THE HOUSING COMMITTEE WE'VE

02:37:41.552 --> 02:37:44.021
SEEN SOME SERIOUS LEGISLATION

02:37:44.087 --> 02:37:47.291
AND WE HAVE -- MOVE FORWARD MANY

02:37:47.357 --> 02:37:49.726
BOLD PIECES OF LEGISLATION THAT

02:37:49.793 --> 02:37:51.428
SOME AGREE WITH AND SOME DON'T.

02:37:51.495 --> 02:37:53.831
BUT THE INTENT HERE IS TO FOCUS

02:37:53.897 --> 02:37:56.033
ON THE CURRENT SITUATION WHICH

02:37:56.099 --> 02:37:57.167
IS.

02:37:57.234 --> 02:37:59.603
NOT ONLY A HOUSING CRISIS BUT

02:37:59.670 --> 02:38:01.438
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE DYING ON OUR

02:38:01.505 --> 02:38:02.739
STREETS IN THE STATE OF

02:38:02.806 --> 02:38:04.241
CALIFORNIA.

02:38:04.308 --> 02:38:06.944
IN ORANGE COUNTY WE'VE HAD JUST

02:38:07.010 --> 02:38:09.213
FIFTEEN NEW DEATHS IN THE MONTH

02:38:09.279 --> 02:38:10.247
OF MAY.

02:38:10.314 --> 02:38:13.917
WHICH TAKES US WELL OVER THREE

02:38:13.984 --> 02:38:15.018
HUNDRED DEATHS SINCE LAST YEAR.

02:38:15.085 --> 02:38:17.387
WE CERTAINLY KNOW THAT THERE IS

02:38:17.454 --> 02:38:19.056
NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL WHEN IT

02:38:19.122 --> 02:38:20.858
COMES TO ZONING WHEN IT COMES TO

02:38:20.924 --> 02:38:24.194
PLANNING -- BUT UNLESS WE START

02:38:24.261 --> 02:38:25.996
TO USE MULTIPLE APPROACHES AND

02:38:26.063 --> 02:38:29.233
GET OUR LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES OUR

02:38:29.299 --> 02:38:32.102
LOCAL ELECTED LEADERS. TO DO

02:38:32.169 --> 02:38:34.037
MORE WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO

02:38:34.104 --> 02:38:36.607
HAVE THE SAME OUTCOMES -- SO AS

02:38:36.673 --> 02:38:38.508
THIS WAS NOTED IT DOES SOME

02:38:38.575 --> 02:38:40.043
THINGS BUT IT DOESN'T DO A LOT

02:38:40.110 --> 02:38:42.946
OF THINGS -- BUT EVERY UP PIECE

02:38:43.013 --> 02:38:45.782
OF THIS PUZZLE TO SOLVE

02:38:45.849 --> 02:38:47.985
HOMELESSNESS -- AND TO GET

02:38:48.051 --> 02:38:50.153
PEOPLE HOUSE ARE YOU CENTRAL --

02:38:50.220 --> 02:38:52.923
SO I DO SUPPORT THIS BILL I WILL

02:38:52.990 --> 02:38:54.858
TELL YOU I HAVE SEVERAL BILLS --

02:38:54.925 --> 02:38:58.095
AND I REALLY BELIEVE THAT AS MY

02:38:58.161 --> 02:39:00.163
COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA BARBARA

02:39:00.230 --> 02:39:02.532
NOTED -- WE HAVE TO TRY MANY

02:39:02.599 --> 02:39:04.334
THINGS SOME OF THEM.

02:39:04.401 --> 02:39:06.136
MAY NOT BE AS EFFECTIVE AS

02:39:06.203 --> 02:39:08.839
OTHERS BUT WE CANNOT BE AT THIS

02:39:08.906 --> 02:39:11.808
TIME REDUCING REDUCING ANY TYPE

02:39:11.875 --> 02:39:14.244
OF HOUSING AND WE ALL TO OFTEN

02:39:14.311 --> 02:39:14.978
HAVE SEEN.

02:39:15.045 --> 02:39:18.749
UP PLANS TABLED UP LOCAL A CITY

02:39:18.815 --> 02:39:21.919
COUNCILS PLANS REJECTED BECAUSE

02:39:21.985 --> 02:39:23.053
PEOPLE DON'T WANT THEM IN THEIR

02:39:23.120 --> 02:39:24.554
NEIGHBOR HOOD OR AND SO FORTH SO

02:39:24.621 --> 02:39:27.024
AGAIN THIS IS A STEP IN --

02:39:27.090 --> 02:39:29.326
KEEPING THINGS CERTAIN AND

02:39:29.393 --> 02:39:33.530
MOVING FORWARD SO I DO SUPPORT

02:39:33.597 --> 02:39:36.733
IT [inaudible]

02:39:36.800 --> 02:39:37.968

02:39:39.937 --> 02:39:40.504
AUTHOR FOR HER APPROACH AND FOR

02:39:40.570 --> 02:39:41.505
ALL OF FOR ALL OF YOUR HARD WORK

02:39:41.571 --> 02:39:42.572
ON THIS BILL.

02:39:42.639 --> 02:39:43.974
APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATIONS WE

02:39:44.041 --> 02:39:45.842
HAVE APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS

02:39:45.909 --> 02:39:47.210
TO TAKE AMENDMENTS A LOT OF

02:39:47.277 --> 02:39:48.078
THOSE AMENDMENTS REPORT TO ME

02:39:48.145 --> 02:39:49.279
IT'S I'M GOING TO BE SUPPORTING

02:39:49.346 --> 02:39:50.614
THE BILL TODAY I WANT.

02:39:50.681 --> 02:39:51.648
TO THANK UP MY COLLEAGUE FROM

02:39:51.715 --> 02:39:53.116
SAN DIEGO WHO ASKED A LOT OF THE

02:39:53.183 --> 02:39:54.217
QUESTIONS THAT I HAD AND

02:39:54.284 --> 02:39:55.519
CLARIFIED A LOT OF THOSE THINGS

02:39:55.585 --> 02:39:56.386
WHICH REPORT TO ME SO I'M NOT

02:39:56.453 --> 02:39:57.854
GONNA.

02:39:57.921 --> 02:39:59.923
RETRIED BACKGROUND I DO -- WANT

02:39:59.990 --> 02:40:02.292
TO SAY THAT -- IT AND I THINK

02:40:02.359 --> 02:40:03.126
YOU SUGGEST AS I THINK THERE'S A

02:40:03.193 --> 02:40:04.728
LOT OF MISINFORMATION ABOUT WHAT

02:40:04.795 --> 02:40:06.163
THIS BILL REALLY DIES AND I

02:40:06.229 --> 02:40:07.631
THINK THAT THERE ARE -- YOU KNOW

02:40:07.698 --> 02:40:08.432
I LOOKED AT SOME OF THE

02:40:08.498 --> 02:40:09.566
OBJECTIONS TO THIS BILL IN THE

02:40:09.633 --> 02:40:12.102
LANGUAGE THAT I'VE SEEN IN IN

02:40:12.169 --> 02:40:13.036
OPPOSITION LETTERS.

02:40:13.103 --> 02:40:13.870
AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THEIR

02:40:13.937 --> 02:40:14.604
CONFLATING DIFFERENT BILLS AND

02:40:14.671 --> 02:40:15.672
I'LL JUST SAY IT SEEMS LIKE A

02:40:15.739 --> 02:40:16.673
LOT OF THESE ARGUMENTS ABOUT

02:40:16.740 --> 02:40:18.408
AGAINST SB FIFTY AND THIS BILL

02:40:18.475 --> 02:40:19.910
IS NOT SB.

02:40:19.977 --> 02:40:20.610
FIFTY THEY ARE VERY VERY

02:40:20.677 --> 02:40:22.045
DIFFERENT BELLS THEIR DIFFERENT

02:40:22.112 --> 02:40:23.413
APPROACHES AND REALLY WHEN I

02:40:23.480 --> 02:40:24.815
SUCH OFF MY STAFF WE WENT

02:40:24.881 --> 02:40:26.450
THROUGH THE ARGUMENTS AND APPLY

02:40:26.516 --> 02:40:28.418
THEM TO THE TAX INCLUDING YOU

02:40:28.485 --> 02:40:29.252
KNOW THE TEXAS IT WILL BE READ

02:40:29.319 --> 02:40:30.320
WITH YOUR MINUTES THEY JUST THEY

02:40:30.387 --> 02:40:32.289
JUST DON'T ADD UP -- AND THEY'RE

02:40:32.356 --> 02:40:33.924
NOT CONSISTENT WITH WHAT I THINK

02:40:33.991 --> 02:40:34.891
THE APPROACH OF THIS BILL IS AND

02:40:34.958 --> 02:40:36.326
WHAT THE WHAT WITH THE STATUTORY

02:40:36.393 --> 02:40:37.427
LANGUAGE SIZE SO.

02:40:37.494 --> 02:40:38.428
I'D REALLY ENCOURAGE A LOT OF

02:40:38.495 --> 02:40:39.429
THE FOLKS ARE OPPOSED TO THIS

02:40:39.496 --> 02:40:40.630
BILL TO GO BACK AND READ THE

02:40:40.697 --> 02:40:42.299
TEXT OF THE BILL TO LOOK AT WHAT

02:40:42.366 --> 02:40:43.734
IT ACTUALLY DOES BECAUSE IT'S

02:40:43.800 --> 02:40:45.569
VERY VERY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT

02:40:45.635 --> 02:40:46.203
SOME OF THE ARGUMENT THAT FOLKS

02:40:46.269 --> 02:40:47.170
ARE MAKING.

02:40:47.237 --> 02:40:48.071
I REPRESENT A VERY SUBURBAN

02:40:48.138 --> 02:40:49.673
DISTRICT I'M UNAPOLOGETIC ABOUT

02:40:49.740 --> 02:40:50.707
THE FACT THAT I LIVE IN THE

02:40:50.774 --> 02:40:52.309
BURBS I LIKE THE QUALITY OF LIFE

02:40:52.376 --> 02:40:52.976
THAT I'M ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR MY

02:40:53.043 --> 02:40:53.643
KIDS.

02:40:53.710 --> 02:40:54.678
AND THE SUGGESTION THAT THIS IS

02:40:54.745 --> 02:40:55.779
GONNA SOMEHOW DESTROY THE SAN

02:40:55.846 --> 02:40:57.748
FERNANDO VALLEY -- I THINK IT'S

02:40:57.814 --> 02:41:01.018
OUTRAGEOUS IT'S NOT GOING TO DO

02:41:01.084 --> 02:41:02.152
THAT AND I ACTUALLY THINK.

02:41:02.219 --> 02:41:03.453
I KNOW THAT THIS IS AN APARTMENT --

02:41:03.520 --> 02:41:04.287
I DESCRIBE IT IS RELATIVELY

02:41:04.354 --> 02:41:05.288
MODEST IN COMMONSENSE I THINK

02:41:05.355 --> 02:41:06.556
WE'RE JUST ASKING FOLKS TO

02:41:06.623 --> 02:41:07.424
PROVIDE SOME CERTAINTY AND

02:41:07.491 --> 02:41:08.859
TIMING AND COST TO WHAT THE

02:41:08.925 --> 02:41:10.727
RULES OF THE ROAD WILL BE.

02:41:10.794 --> 02:41:11.995
I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING AS AS

02:41:12.062 --> 02:41:12.629
OUR CULTURE SAN DIEGO SAID THE

02:41:12.696 --> 02:41:14.331
FUNCTION EXPECT FROM GOVERNMENT

02:41:14.398 --> 02:41:15.499
AND WE'RE NOT REQUIRING FOLKS

02:41:15.565 --> 02:41:16.299
TOPS OWN.

02:41:16.366 --> 02:41:17.167
THEIR TO DO ANY OF THE OTHER

02:41:17.234 --> 02:41:18.335
THINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING

02:41:18.402 --> 02:41:20.837
ABOUT THIS IS SIMPLY -- ASKING

02:41:20.904 --> 02:41:22.205
THE GOVERNMENT TO HELP US

02:41:22.272 --> 02:41:23.373
CONSISTENT SEVERAL SO FOLKS CAN

02:41:23.440 --> 02:41:24.941
HAVE A REASONABLE EXPECTATION

02:41:25.008 --> 02:41:26.143
WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING ABOUT.

02:41:26.209 --> 02:41:27.411
AND YOU KNOW I ALSO WANT TO ECHO

02:41:27.477 --> 02:41:29.112
THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE

02:41:29.179 --> 02:41:29.780
FROM ORANGE COUNTY THE BACKDROP

02:41:29.846 --> 02:41:31.515
OF THIS IS AN UNPRECEDENTED

02:41:31.581 --> 02:41:32.816
HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING CRISIS

02:41:32.883 --> 02:41:33.984
IN OUR STATE.

02:41:34.051 --> 02:41:35.285
FOLKS ARE DYING ON THE STREETS

02:41:35.352 --> 02:41:36.820
WE SAW THE NUMBERS FROM THE MOST

02:41:36.887 --> 02:41:37.454
RECENT HOMES COUNT IN THE CITY

02:41:37.521 --> 02:41:39.022
OF LA AND THE COUNTY OF LOS

02:41:39.089 --> 02:41:40.690
ANGELES AND IT'S UNCONSCIONABLE

02:41:40.757 --> 02:41:42.159
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR CITIES.

02:41:42.225 --> 02:41:43.160
AND SO WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO

02:41:43.226 --> 02:41:44.494
BE DOING MORE I THINK THIS IS

02:41:44.561 --> 02:41:45.796
ABSOLUTELY A STEP IN THE RIGHT

02:41:45.862 --> 02:41:47.297
DIRECTION WE KNOW THAT THE

02:41:47.364 --> 02:41:48.031
PRODUCTION PIECE.

02:41:48.098 --> 02:41:49.433
AND PARTICULARLY THE PRODUCTION

02:41:49.499 --> 02:41:51.034
OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND WE

02:41:51.101 --> 02:41:52.636
HAVE THE MOST.

02:41:52.702 --> 02:41:53.937
SIGNIFICANT ADVOCATES HERE YOU

02:41:54.004 --> 02:41:54.738

02:41:54.805 --> 02:41:55.605
THIS BUT WE KNOW THAT THAT'S A

02:41:55.672 --> 02:41:57.674
KEY PART TO SOLVING THIS CRISIS

02:41:57.741 --> 02:41:58.475
IS PRODUCING MORE AFFORDABLE

02:41:58.542 --> 02:42:00.243
HOUSING SO -- FOR THOSE REASONS

02:42:00.310 --> 02:42:01.344
ARE GONNA BE PLEASED TO SUPPORT

02:42:01.411 --> 02:42:02.979

THIS SITUATION FROM MY

02:55:32.822 --> 02:55:33.789
BECAUSE MY CURRENT LANDLORD

02:55:50.606 --> 02:55:51.807

EXCELLENT RENTAL HISTORY I'VE

LATE.

02:55:58.347 --> 02:55:59.882
AND I'M FORTUNATE ENOUGH THAT MY

COUNCIL MEMBER.

02:56:05.588 --> 02:56:06.889
THESE REDUCTIONS OF PILED UP AND

02:56:06.956 --> 02:56:08.624
AT THIS POINT I HAVE TRIED TO

APPLY TO BETWEEN NINETY AND ONE

02:56:10.459 --> 02:56:11.794
HUNDREDAPARTMENTS.

OUT OF THOSE ONLY ONE PLACES

02:56:14.263 --> 02:56:14.730
ALLOWED ME TO FILL OUT AN

02:56:14.797 --> 02:56:16.132

02:56:16.198 --> 02:56:17.533
THE WEBSITES GIVEN TO ME BY THE

02:56:17.600 --> 02:56:19.335

THAT ACCEPT SECTION.

02:56:20.569 --> 02:56:21.871
EIGHT HAVEN'T EVEN HAD ONE

OPENING IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS

02:56:24.507 --> 02:56:25.775
SINCE I FIRST GOT MY VOUCHER.

02:56:25.841 --> 02:56:27.443
I HAVE UNTIL SEPTEMBER FIRST TO

02:56:27.510 --> 02:56:28.778
FIND SOMEONE TO TAKE MY VOUCHER

02:56:28.844 --> 02:56:30.179
OR I WILL LOSE MY HOUSING

02:56:30.246 --> 02:56:32.415
ASSISTANCE BEFORE I'VE EVER EVEN

02:56:32.481 --> 02:56:33.716
GOTTEN A CHANCE TO USE IT.

02:56:33.783 --> 02:56:34.951
LOSING THE ASSISTANCE WILL MEAN

02:56:35.017 --> 02:56:36.452
THAT I WILL MOST LIKELY END UP

02:56:36.519 --> 02:56:37.853
HOMELESS.

02:56:37.920 --> 02:56:39.188
I TRULY BELIEVE THAT IF I WAS

02:56:39.255 --> 02:56:41.590
JUST GIVEN THE CHANCE TO APPLY

02:56:41.657 --> 02:56:42.491
THAT MANAGEMENT COMPANIES AND

02:56:42.558 --> 02:56:43.826
OWNERS WOULD SEE THAT I'M A

02:56:43.893 --> 02:56:45.328
GREAT TENANT AND I WOULD FIND AN

02:56:45.394 --> 02:56:47.330
OWNER WILLING TO TAKE MY VOUCHER.

02:56:47.396 --> 02:56:49.231
THE PROBLEM IS THAT I CAN'T EVEN

02:56:49.298 --> 02:56:50.599
GET THAT INFORMATION OUT THERE

02:56:50.666 --> 02:56:52.268
SIMPLY BECAUSE I HAVE A HOUSING

02:56:52.335 --> 02:56:53.302
VOUCHER.

02:56:53.369 --> 02:56:55.304
THAT IS WHY SB THREE TWENTY NINE

02:56:55.371 --> 02:56:57.039
IS SO IMPORTANT AFTER WAITING

02:56:57.106 --> 02:56:58.808

STRUGGLING RENTERS SHOULDN'T BE

FORCED TO RETURN THAT ASSISTANCE

02:57:04.981 --> 02:57:05.948
BECAUSE OF DISCRIMINATION

02:57:06.015 --> 02:57:07.283

02:57:07.350 --> 02:57:08.918

THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

03:08:16.518 --> 03:08:18.053
IF IT WAS TRUE.

03:08:18.120 --> 03:08:20.555
AS NOTED THAT IT ONLY TOOK ONE

03:08:20.622 --> 03:08:22.691

THEREFORE BELIEVE THAT THE

03:08:43.578 --> 03:08:45.847
SECOND POINT -- THAT WOULD BE

03:08:45.914 --> 03:08:48.984
APPROPRIATE IF IT SAID THAT.

POINT -- THAT WE SEE AND IN THE

03:09:19.781 --> 03:09:22.784
PROVIDING THIS TO BE A PROBLEM

03:09:22.851 --> 03:09:25.053
IS THAT NO ONE HAS SEEN WHAT THE

03:18:34.335 --> 03:18:35.903
TO THIS ILLUSTRATES THE POINT OF

03:18:35.970 --> 03:18:36.971
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

03:18:37.038 --> 03:18:38.339
IF MS MET IN THE SENATOR WAS

03:18:38.406 --> 03:18:39.907
ASKING YOU TO RENT TO SOMEONE

03:18:39.974 --> 03:18:42.143
THAT WAS A DISASTER OF A TENANT --

03:18:42.210 --> 03:18:42.910
THAT WOULD BE VERY VERY

03:18:42.977 --> 03:18:44.312
DIFFERENT BUT THIS SIMPLY SAYS

03:18:44.379 --> 03:18:46.147
THAT YOU CANNOT ADVERTISE TO SAY

03:18:46.214 --> 03:18:47.982
THAT YOU CAN'T DO THAT BUT YOU

03:18:48.049 --> 03:18:49.350
DON'T SPECIFICALLY DISCRIMINATE.

03:18:49.417 --> 03:18:50.985
AND I DON'T KNOW ANOTHER

03:18:51.052 --> 03:18:51.919
SITUATION WHERE THIS IS EVEN

03:18:51.986 --> 03:18:53.955
CLOSE -- FOR US TO CONSIDER THAT

03:18:54.022 --> 03:18:55.623
WOULD BE THE CASE CAN LOCAL

03:18:55.690 --> 03:18:57.025
HOUSING AUTHORITIES DO BETTER NO

03:18:57.091 --> 03:18:58.693
QUESTION I SERVED ON HOUSING

03:18:58.760 --> 03:18:59.927
COMMISSION FOR MANY YEARS WE

03:18:59.994 --> 03:19:01.629
WORK HARD TO TRY AND REDUCE THE

03:19:01.696 --> 03:19:02.797
REGULATORY BARRIERS.

03:19:02.864 --> 03:19:04.098
TO PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM

03:19:04.165 --> 03:19:05.400
AND WE SHOULD ALL GO BACK TO OUR

03:19:05.466 --> 03:19:06.501
OWN DISTRICTS AND MAKE SURE THAT

03:19:06.567 --> 03:19:07.935
EVERY HOUSING AUTHORITY'S BEING

03:19:08.002 --> 03:19:09.804
AS CONSUMER FRIENDLY -- AS SOME

03:19:09.871 --> 03:19:11.239
OF THE BETTER ONES THAT WERE

03:19:11.306 --> 03:19:12.640
MENTIONED -- IN TESTIMONY BUT

03:19:12.707 --> 03:19:14.375
GUYS WE HAVE TO SUPPORT THIS

03:19:14.442 --> 03:19:16.444
BILL YOU WOULD NOT STAND FOR

03:19:16.511 --> 03:19:17.645
SUPPORTING A LANDLORD WHO CAME

NONE OF YOU WOULD VOTE FOR THAT

03:19:26.888 --> 03:19:27.422
HOW ON EARTH COULD YOU EVER

03:19:27.488 --> 03:19:28.056
SUPPORT ANYTHING THAT SUGGESTS

03:19:28.122 --> 03:19:29.023

AND HOW.

03:19:45.440 --> 03:19:47.141
I WANTED TO LEAST RAZOR A COUPLE

03:19:47.208 --> 03:19:51.446

COURSE MOST PEOPLE WOULD TAKE IT.

03:20:01.789 --> 03:20:03.691
SO SO WE HAVE ASK HERSELF WHY IS

03:20:03.758 --> 03:20:06.627
IT THAT A LOT OF PROPERTY OWNER.

03:20:06.694 --> 03:20:08.229
WOULD RATHER NOT TAKE SECTION

EIGHT HOUSING IS T BECAUSE OF

03:20:09.597 --> 03:20:10.998
THE THE BUREAUCRATIC PROCESS

03:20:11.065 --> 03:20:12.600
THAT.

03:20:12.667 --> 03:20:15.069
THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH -- TO TO

INTO INTO DOING SOMETHING THAT

03:20:25.446 --> 03:20:26.481
THEY DON'T WANT IS IS IS IS VERY

03:20:26.547 --> 03:20:28.316
TROUBLING IT'S LIKE IT'S LIKE

THAT THAT'S HOW I UNDERSTAND

03:20:48.069 --> 03:20:49.170
THIS BILL IS IS LIKE WE'RE

03:20:49.237 --> 03:20:50.304

03:20:50.371 --> 03:20:52.440
PEOPLE INTO DOING SOMETHING THAT

03:20:52.507 --> 03:20:54.742
THEY'LL LIKE IN IT IN TERM OF OF

DON'T.

03:20:59.814 --> 03:21:00.081
THINK THAT.

03:21:00.148 --> 03:21:03.017
WE HAVE A A PROBLEM OF OF

03:21:03.084 --> 03:21:05.453
PROPERTY OWNER DISCRIMINATING ON

03:21:05.520 --> 03:21:08.089
THE BASIS OF RACE OR OR GENDER

OR IN CLASS BUT NO.

03:21:09.090 --> 03:21:10.525
WE DO HAVE SOME COMMUNITY THAT

03:21:10.591 --> 03:21:12.627
DOES ADVERTISE SOMETHING TO THE

03:21:12.693 --> 03:21:16.798
EFFECT OF THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

03:21:16.864 --> 03:21:17.965
ONLY ALLOWS.

03:21:18.032 --> 03:21:21.202
SENIOR CITIZEN BILLS THAT.

03:21:21.269 --> 03:21:23.271
OUR FIFTY FIVE A ORDER MAY APPLY

03:21:23.337 --> 03:21:24.238
IF YOU'RE NOT WITHIN THE AGE

GROUP THAN THERE IS SOME SORT OF

03:21:26.407 --> 03:21:30.144
SUCH PREFERENCES AS TO WHETHER.

03:21:30.211 --> 03:21:31.679
YOU FIT INTO THE COMMUNITY.

03:21:31.746 --> 03:21:33.481
SO IS SO IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF

03:21:33.548 --> 03:21:35.483
ACTUALLY PEOPLE CREATING

03:21:35.550 --> 03:21:37.351
PREFERENCES YES.

03:21:37.418 --> 03:21:39.620
THERE ARE 	C THERE ARE

03:21:39.687 --> 03:21:40.688
MOBILE HOME PARK AND IN MY A

03:21:40.755 --> 03:21:42.223
DISTRICT THERE ARE APARTMENT

03:21:42.290 --> 03:21:43.724
COMPLEXES IN MY DISTRICT THAT

03:21:43.791 --> 03:21:45.359
DOES.

03:21:45.426 --> 03:21:46.861
HAVE.

ONE OF BASED ON AGE BECAUSE THEY

WANT A COMMUNITY JUST BEFORE SHE

03:21:55.203 --> 03:21:56.971
IS IT IS IT.

03:21:57.038 --> 03:22:00.575
AND SO I I I I THINK THAT IF IF

03:22:00.641 --> 03:22:02.376
THE A. V..

03:22:02.443 --> 03:22:02.977
THE INTENTION OF THE AUTHOR IS

03:22:03.044 --> 03:22:06.581
TO ME. TO MAKE SURE THAT A THIS

03:22:06.647 --> 03:22:08.316
BILL DOES NOT MANDATE PEOPLE

03:22:08.382 --> 03:22:10.585
FROM DOING DO WHAT THEY DON'T

03:22:10.651 --> 03:22:10.918
WANT.

03:22:10.985 --> 03:22:12.420
THEN SHE SHOULD SERIOUSLY

03:22:12.487 --> 03:22:13.554
CONSIDER.

03:22:13.621 --> 03:22:16.757
TAKING THOSE AMENDMENTS.

03:22:16.824 --> 03:22:23.064
MISS QUIRK SILVA -- SENATOR.

03:22:23.130 --> 03:22:25.733
THANK YOU TO THE SENATOR UP FOR

03:22:25.800 --> 03:22:28.302
BRINGING THIS FORWARD ALSO I TO

THOSE WHO SUPPORT AND ALSO

03:22:30.404 --> 03:22:31.806
OPPOSE THAT SOUNDS KIND OF AN

03:22:31.873 --> 03:22:34.242
INTERESTING BUT I THINK THAT --

03:22:34.308 --> 03:22:36.544
THE MEMBER FROM -- SOUTHERN

03:22:36.611 --> 03:22:38.145
CALIFORNIA.

03:22:38.212 --> 03:22:40.181
GARDEN GROVE TALKED ABOUT

03:22:40.248 --> 03:22:41.782
PREFERENCES AND I THINK.

03:22:41.849 --> 03:22:43.518
YOU KNOW WE ALL HAVE PREFERENCES

03:22:43.584 --> 03:22:44.519

WHO WE WANT TO OF YOU DON'T LIVE

03:22:51.759 --> 03:22:52.627
NEXT.

03:22:52.693 --> 03:22:53.995
TO AND I DO THINK THAT IS AN

03:22:54.061 --> 03:22:57.031
IMPORTANT QUESTION -- FOR OWNERS

03:22:57.098 --> 03:22:58.666
TO THINK ABOUT SO EVEN THOUGH

03:22:58.733 --> 03:22:59.901
THEY MAY NOT APPEAR TO HAVE

03:22:59.967 --> 03:23:02.303
BIASES WHY IS IT.

03:23:02.370 --> 03:23:05.439
SO RAMPANT THAT PEOPLE DON'T

03:23:05.506 --> 03:23:06.908
WANT TO TAKE SECTION.

03:23:06.974 --> 03:23:08.042
EIGHT I HAVE MY OPINION ABOUT

03:23:08.109 --> 03:23:10.645
THAT AND I DO KNOW IN THE PAST

03:23:10.711 --> 03:23:12.480
OVER YEARS I'VE HEARD THINGS

03:23:12.547 --> 03:23:14.482
ABOUT SECTION EIGHT THAT MAY BE

03:23:14.549 --> 03:23:16.350
TRUE OR NOT LIKE -- THAT'S WHERE

03:23:16.417 --> 03:23:17.518
ALL THE SECTION EIGHT PEOPLE

03:23:17.585 --> 03:23:20.788
LIVE SO THERE PROBABLY IS SOME

03:23:20.855 --> 03:23:23.291
TYPE OF APARTMENT OWNERS WHO ARE

03:23:23.357 --> 03:23:25.192
WILLING TO TAKE IT AND THEN OF

03:23:25.259 --> 03:23:26.694
COURSE YOU HAVE SECTION EIGHT

03:23:26.761 --> 03:23:27.828
PEOPLE LIVING IN THERE.

03:23:27.895 --> 03:23:30.131
BUT MANY TIMES WE DON'T KNOW

03:23:30.197 --> 03:23:32.333
PEOPLE'S PERSONAL BUSINESS AND

03:23:32.400 --> 03:23:34.368
WE PROBABLY SHOULDN'T -- AND WE

03:23:34.435 --> 03:23:35.403
WOULDN'T KNOW IF THEY'RE SECTION

03:23:35.469 --> 03:23:37.471
NADER NOT UNLESS SOMEBODY IS

03:23:37.538 --> 03:23:39.640
EXPLICITLY TELLING PEOPLE THAT

03:23:39.707 --> 03:23:40.808
THEY ARE.

03:23:40.875 --> 03:23:42.443
BUT I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS

03:23:42.510 --> 03:23:45.212
THAT WE HAVE SEEN OVER AND OVER

03:23:45.279 --> 03:23:48.082
IS THIS DISCLAIMER THAT SAYS NO

03:23:48.149 --> 03:23:50.651
SECTION EIGHT I HAVE A SON WHO'S

03:23:50.718 --> 03:23:52.987
TWENTY TWO YEARS OLD AND I JUST

03:23:53.054 --> 03:23:55.189
WENT OUT TO READ HIS VERY FIRST

03:23:55.256 --> 03:23:57.391
APARTMENT WITH A ROOMMATE IN LOS

03:23:57.458 --> 03:23:58.459
ANGELES.

03:23:58.526 --> 03:24:00.795
AND HE LOOKED THROUGH MANY MANY

03:24:00.861 --> 03:24:02.530
OF THOSE ADS AND I LOOKED ALONG

03:24:02.597 --> 03:24:05.766
WITH HIM -- FIRST COST WAS A

03:24:05.833 --> 03:24:07.969
HUGE -- BUT THEN SECOND HAVING

03:24:08.035 --> 03:24:10.338
RENTAL HISTORY AS A TWENTY TWO

03:24:10.404 --> 03:24:12.940
YEAR OLD WAS ANOTHER BARRIER.

03:24:13.007 --> 03:24:14.842
AND RIGHT AWAY AS WE WERE

03:24:14.909 --> 03:24:17.011
LOOKING THROUGH THESE ADS I WAS

03:24:17.078 --> 03:24:18.746
SURPRISED TO SEE HOW MANY

03:24:18.813 --> 03:24:20.381
SECTION.

03:24:20.448 --> 03:24:21.482
EIGHT DISCLAIMERS WERE ON THERE

03:24:21.549 --> 03:24:24.952
SO WITH THAT BEING SAID I AM

03:24:25.019 --> 03:24:27.088
STILL -- CONCERNED ABOUT THE

03:24:27.154 --> 03:24:29.824
MANDATE IN THE INTAKE BUT ON THE

03:24:29.890 --> 03:24:32.460
PART WHERE YOU SAID THE SENATE

03:24:32.526 --> 03:24:33.694
JUDICIARY [inaudible]

03:24:33.761 --> 03:24:36.797
COMMITTEE MENTIONS.

03:24:36.864 --> 03:24:38.733
THE CONTRACT.

03:24:38.799 --> 03:24:42.503
RIGHTS ON ITEM.

03:24:42.570 --> 03:24:44.538
FIVE YOU KNOW I THINK THAT WE

03:24:44.605 --> 03:24:46.474
WANT SPECIFIC LANGUAGE I KNOW

03:24:46.540 --> 03:24:48.275
YOU WANT THE INTAKE LANGUAGE THE

03:24:48.342 --> 03:24:50.645
SECOND PART OF IT -- THE SENATOR

03:24:50.711 --> 03:24:53.014
IS TAKEN THE FIRST PART AND ON

03:24:53.080 --> 03:24:54.315
IT'S BEEN SAID THAT IF YOU AT

03:24:54.382 --> 03:24:55.549
THE SECOND YOU WOULD REMOVE

03:24:55.616 --> 03:24:57.084
OPPOSITION.

03:24:57.151 --> 03:25:00.788
BUT I THINK RIGHT TO THIS SAYING

03:25:00.855 --> 03:25:02.923
THAT.

03:25:02.990 --> 03:25:04.659
IN ESSENCE YOU'RE OPENING UP THE

03:25:04.725 --> 03:25:07.028
APPLICATION PROCESS AND THEY

03:25:07.094 --> 03:25:09.463
STILL HAVE THE CHOICE TO CHOOSE

03:25:09.530 --> 03:25:11.098
THE SECTION EIGHT PERSON.

03:25:11.165 --> 03:25:15.569
OR NOT -- SO I THINK THAT THAT

03:25:15.636 --> 03:25:17.271
THEY ARE NOT SAYING IF THERE'S

03:25:17.338 --> 03:25:18.539
THREE APPLICANTS YOU HAVE TO

03:25:18.606 --> 03:25:20.074
CHOOSE A SECTION EIGHT IS THAT

03:25:20.141 --> 03:25:22.176
CORRECT.

03:25:22.243 --> 03:25:23.778
JUST AS CORRECT THEY WOULD NOT

03:25:23.844 --> 03:25:26.447
HAVE TO CHOOSE THE SECTION EIGHT

03:25:26.514 --> 03:25:27.515
THERE I RECENTLY SEEN BY

03:25:27.581 --> 03:25:30.184
REMOVING THE SECTION EIGHT YES

03:25:30.251 --> 03:25:32.486
THERE WE MORE APPLICATIONS TO GO

03:25:32.553 --> 03:25:33.487
THROUGH.

03:25:33.554 --> 03:25:35.489
AND SOMEBODY MAY FIND SOMEBODY

03:25:35.556 --> 03:25:40.895
THAT'S A A BEFORE -- BUT IT

03:25:40.961 --> 03:25:42.663
DOESN'T SAY YOU HAVE TO TAKE

03:25:42.730 --> 03:25:44.565
THEM SO DOES NOT TRUE THAT IS

03:25:44.632 --> 03:25:47.168
CORRECT OKAY BUT IF THEY DO

03:25:47.234 --> 03:25:48.569
CHOOSE TO TAKE THEM.

03:25:48.636 --> 03:25:50.738
THEN THEY WOULD HAVE TO COMPLY

03:25:50.805 --> 03:25:51.872
WITH GOING THROUGH THE

03:25:51.939 --> 03:25:54.975
ORIENTATION AND GOING THROUGH

03:25:55.042 --> 03:25:55.276
[inaudible]

03:25:55.342 --> 03:25:57.511
THE INSPECTION.

03:25:57.578 --> 03:25:59.647
SACRAMENTO THAT IS CORRECT BUT

03:25:59.714 --> 03:26:01.782
ALSO WHEN ANYBODY IS RENTING A

03:26:01.849 --> 03:26:03.284
NEW APARTMENT UNLESS I'M

03:26:03.350 --> 03:26:06.821
COMPLETELY WRONG -- MARKET RATE

03:26:06.887 --> 03:26:09.256
ANY TYPE OF APARTMENT THERE ARE

03:26:09.323 --> 03:26:11.692
CERTAIN OF KIND OF SCENARIOS

03:26:11.759 --> 03:26:13.594
THEY HAVE TO COMPLY WITH WHETHER

03:26:13.661 --> 03:26:15.663
IT BE PAINTING CARPET ALL OF

03:26:15.730 --> 03:26:17.531
THOSE ISSUES THAT YOU WOULD DO

03:26:17.598 --> 03:26:18.833
TO PREPARE FOR A NEW PARK

03:26:18.899 --> 03:26:20.267
APARTMENT IS THAT CORRECT.

03:26:20.334 --> 03:26:21.569
THAT THAT'S CORRECT IT IN

03:26:21.635 --> 03:26:24.004
ADDITION TO AN ANNUAL INSPECTION

03:26:24.071 --> 03:26:28.109
REQUIRED -- OF ALL RENTAL UNITS --

03:26:28.175 --> 03:26:29.677
BY YOUR LOCAL HOUSING AUTHORITY

03:26:29.744 --> 03:26:31.545
YOU KNOW WHETHER I HAVE A IT AS

03:26:31.612 --> 03:26:32.980
A NEW TO THIS COMING IN OR NOT

03:26:33.047 --> 03:26:34.381
I'M REQUIRED TO HAVE AN ANNUAL

03:26:34.448 --> 03:26:37.518
INSPECTION -- BITE MY LOCAL

03:26:37.585 --> 03:26:39.386
HOUSING AUTHORITIES SO THAT TOO

03:26:39.453 --> 03:26:40.321
IS CORRECT.

03:26:40.387 --> 03:26:42.056
MATT AGAIN IN SOME WAYS IF YOU

03:26:42.123 --> 03:26:45.760
TURN THE OF THE SCENARIO AROUND.

03:26:45.826 --> 03:26:47.228
I DON'T THINK AN ANNUAL

03:26:47.294 --> 03:26:50.097
INSPECTION IS REQUIRED OF JUST A

03:26:50.164 --> 03:26:52.233
REGULAR.

03:26:52.299 --> 03:26:53.467
IS THAT NO IT IS.

03:26:53.534 --> 03:26:54.735
IN IN SOME JURISDICTIONS IT IS

03:26:54.802 --> 03:26:57.471
IT DEPENDS ON LOCAL REGULATIONS

03:26:57.538 --> 03:26:58.839
ARE FOR EXAMPLE IN LOS ANGELES.

03:26:58.906 --> 03:27:01.008
THE CITY REGULARLY INSPECTS ALL

03:27:01.075 --> 03:27:02.042
RENTAL UNITS TO MAKE SURE

03:27:02.109 --> 03:27:04.211
THEY'RE THEM MAINTAINED AND OUR

03:27:04.278 --> 03:27:05.112
MEETING BASIC.

03:27:05.179 --> 03:27:07.548
HEALTH AND SAFETY SO WHETHER YOU

03:27:07.615 --> 03:27:08.048
YOU.

03:27:08.115 --> 03:27:09.850
PREFERRED EXPECT A INSPECTION OR

03:27:09.917 --> 03:27:11.519
NOT I DO THINK THERE IS SOME

03:27:11.585 --> 03:27:13.287
GOOD NEWS TO THAT IN THE GOOD

03:27:13.354 --> 03:27:15.256
NEWS WHEN YOU LOOK AT YOUR PROS

03:27:15.322 --> 03:27:17.191
AND CONS IS YOU DO WANT TO GET

03:27:17.258 --> 03:27:18.859
INTO THE APARTMENTS THAT YOU

03:27:18.926 --> 03:27:20.361
WILL SEE THAT YOU ARE.

03:27:20.427 --> 03:27:22.429
RENT TEEN AND MAKE SURE THAT IN

03:27:22.496 --> 03:27:25.399
FACT THEY'RE NOT ONLY SAFE BUT

03:27:25.466 --> 03:27:26.834
THERE'S ISSUES IF THEY NEED TO

03:27:26.901 --> 03:27:29.236
BE ADDRESSED THAT MAYBE A RENTER

03:27:29.303 --> 03:27:30.671
HASN'T EVEN BROUGHT UP TO YOU --

03:27:30.738 --> 03:27:32.706
ON AN ANNUAL BASIS THAT YOU CAN

03:27:32.773 --> 03:27:35.042
CORRECT BEFORE IT BECOMES A HUGE

03:27:35.109 --> 03:27:37.077
LITIGATION ISSUE SO THAT A LONG

03:27:37.144 --> 03:27:40.181
WINDED WAY I DO SUPPORT THIS I

03:27:40.247 --> 03:27:42.783
WOULD ASK THE AUTHOR -- I KNOW

03:27:42.850 --> 03:27:45.019
THAT SHE IS TAKEN SERIOUSLY THE

03:27:45.085 --> 03:27:47.855
INTAKE -- AND HAS CHOSEN PART OF

03:27:47.922 --> 03:27:53.327
IT -- YOU HAVE GIVEN.

03:27:53.394 --> 03:27:54.628
FROM THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE --

03:27:54.695 --> 03:27:56.463
COMMITTEE THE ITEM THAT YOU

03:27:56.530 --> 03:27:57.898
BELIEVE.

03:27:57.965 --> 03:27:59.033
VERIFIES THAT THIS IS NOT A

03:27:59.099 --> 03:28:02.536
MANDATE -- THAT AGAIN AS WE MOVE

03:28:02.603 --> 03:28:04.171
FORWARD IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT THE

03:28:04.238 --> 03:28:06.273
NARRATIVE AND IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT

03:28:06.340 --> 03:28:08.676
WHAT PEOPLE BELIEVE SO I DON'T

03:28:08.742 --> 03:28:11.378
BELIEVE THAT BY AND LARGE.

03:28:11.445 --> 03:28:13.247
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE EVERYBODY

03:28:13.314 --> 03:28:14.515
RUNNING TO THE SENATE.

03:28:14.582 --> 03:28:17.384
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND LOOKING

03:28:17.451 --> 03:28:19.787
FOR THAT ITEM TO PROVE IT.

03:28:19.854 --> 03:28:22.122
WELL IT'S DOUBLE REFERRED SO

03:28:22.189 --> 03:28:22.756
THEY CAN RUN TO THE SIMILAR TO

03:28:22.823 --> 03:28:24.258
WHAT I CAN SAY IS FOR THE PEOPLE

03:28:24.325 --> 03:28:26.227
WHO ARE OPPOSE IT REALLY IS UP

03:28:26.293 --> 03:28:27.928
TO YOU TO LOOK AT THAT.

03:28:27.995 --> 03:28:30.998
ITEM AND MAKE SURE THAT -- YOU

03:28:31.065 --> 03:28:32.533
ARE THE ONES THAT ARE USING THAT

03:28:32.600 --> 03:28:35.736
LANGUAGE TO TO YOUR MEMBERSHIP

03:28:35.803 --> 03:28:37.972

IN TWO VERY VERY DIFFERENT WAYS.

03:28:41.141 --> 03:28:43.444
AND SO WHERE IS THE TRUTH AND I

03:28:43.510 --> 03:28:45.779
THINK THAT IT IS UP TO YOU TO

03:28:45.846 --> 03:28:47.214
SAY WE ARE PART OF AN

03:28:47.281 --> 03:28:49.683

THAT SAYS WE KNOW WE HAVE A

03:28:50.985 --> 03:28:53.020
HOMELESSNESS CRISIS WE WANT TO

03:28:53.087 --> 03:28:56.190
HOUSE PEOPLE THESE VOUCHERS --

03:28:56.257 --> 03:28:59.093
CAN BE A TOOL TO GET PEOPLE ON

03:28:59.159 --> 03:29:01.795
HOUSING AND THIS BILL.

03:29:01.862 --> 03:29:03.998
IS NOT PERFECT BY ANY MEANS BUT

03:29:04.064 --> 03:29:06.800
IT WILL ALLOW PEOPLE TO USE

03:29:06.867 --> 03:29:08.469
THESE AND IF WE TAKE OFF THE

03:29:08.535 --> 03:29:09.837

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- SO I

03:29:30.591 --> 03:29:31.392

03:29:32.226 --> 03:29:34.094
COMMENTS FROM THE VICE CHAIR --

03:29:34.161 --> 03:29:35.729

CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS IN

THE STATE THAT PROHIBIT PEOPLE

03:29:44.505 --> 03:29:45.806
FROM DISCRIMINATING ON THE BASIS

03:29:45.873 --> 03:29:48.175

YOU HAVE TO RENT TO JEWS ARE YOU

03:29:55.316 --> 03:29:56.083

PROPERTY ON THE MARKET IN AND

IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T

03:30:14.768 --> 03:30:15.869
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST A CERTAIN

03:30:15.936 --> 03:30:17.871
CLASS OF FOLKS -- AND AND I WILL

SAY I AM SENSITIVE -- TO TO TO

03:30:21.041 --> 03:30:22.076
THE OPPOSITION IT SEEMS TO ME

03:30:22.142 --> 03:30:22.576
THAT MAYBE THERE'S SOME

03:30:22.643 --> 03:30:24.578
DIFFERENT CONCERNS -- I AM

03:30:24.645 --> 03:30:25.579
SENSITIVE TO OF BURDENSOME

03:30:25.646 --> 03:30:27.047
GOVERNMENT MANDATES ON THE

03:30:27.114 --> 03:30:27.982
PRIVATE SECTOR AND THINGS THAT

03:30:28.048 --> 03:30:29.883
ARE GOING -- TO YOU KNOW BE

03:30:29.950 --> 03:30:30.985
REALLY DIFFICULT FOR FOLKS TO

03:30:31.051 --> 03:30:32.686
COMPLY WITH BUT I AM I AM

03:30:32.753 --> 03:30:34.388
PERSONALLY -- STRUGGLING TO SEE

03:30:34.455 --> 03:30:36.023
THAT HERE IT DOESN'T SEEM TO ME

03:30:36.090 --> 03:30:37.024
THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S

03:30:37.091 --> 03:30:38.325
OVERLY BURDENSOME IT JUST SEEMS

03:30:38.392 --> 03:30:40.160
TO ME THAT -- RATHER THAN AN

03:30:40.227 --> 03:30:41.495
OUTRIGHT REJECTION UP FRONT YOU

03:30:41.562 --> 03:30:43.097
HAVE TO TAKE A A FAIR LOOK AT

03:30:43.163 --> 03:30:44.331
THAT PERSON CONSIDER THEM ND

03:30:44.398 --> 03:30:45.566
AND THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE AND

03:30:45.632 --> 03:30:46.200
I I AGREE WITH AS AN ATTORNEY

03:30:46.266 --> 03:30:48.302
GREAT THE ANALYSIS THAT DOESN'T

03:30:48.369 --> 03:30:48.869
REQUIRE YOU TO RENT TO THAT

03:30:48.936 --> 03:30:50.437
PERSON OR OR OR OR LEAST.

03:30:50.504 --> 03:30:52.006
ABOUT PERSONAGES SAYS YOU CAN'T

03:30:52.072 --> 03:30:53.841
CATEGORICALLY DENY THAT CLASS OF

03:30:53.907 --> 03:30:55.442
FOLKS THE OPPORTUNITY TO EVEN

03:30:55.509 --> 03:30:58.779
APPLY SO -- I'M HAPPY TO TO TO

03:30:58.846 --> 03:30:59.980
CONSIDER THAT MORNING OR IF

03:31:00.047 --> 03:31:02.349
TERE ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO.

03:31:02.416 --> 03:31:03.617
TO RELIEVE SOME OF THOSE BURDENS

03:31:03.684 --> 03:31:04.685
AND OTHER WAYS I'D BE VERY

03:31:04.752 --> 03:31:06.320
INTERESTED TO KNOW THAT BECAUSE

03:31:06.387 --> 03:31:08.555
I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT -- TO

03:31:08.622 --> 03:31:09.523
YOU KNOW NOT UNNECESSARILY

03:31:09.590 --> 03:31:10.758
BURDEN FOLKS BUT I WOULD JUST

03:31:10.824 --> 03:31:11.558
TELL YOU AS I SAT HERE AND TRY

03:31:11.625 --> 03:31:12.226
TO LISTEN TO THIS TESTIMONY VERY

03:31:12.292 --> 03:31:13.127
CAREFULLY.

03:31:13.193 --> 03:31:14.695
I'M STRUGGLING TO SEE SOMETHING

03:31:14.762 --> 03:31:16.563
THAT SEEMS LIKE AN UNFAIR BURDEN

03:31:16.630 --> 03:31:18.632
ON ON THE PRIVATE SECTOR -- AND

03:31:18.699 --> 03:31:19.433
AND VERY OPEN IF YOU HAVE

03:31:19.500 --> 03:31:21.402
SUGGESTIONS ABOUT THINGS THAT WE

03:31:21.468 --> 03:31:23.070
COULD DO -- TED TAX WOULD LIKE

03:31:23.137 --> 03:31:24.104
THAT I THINK THAT YOU KNOW I

03:31:24.171 --> 03:31:25.139
WILL TAKE YOUR WORD THAT THERE

03:31:25.205 --> 03:31:26.807
IS AN OBJECTION TO THIS CLASS OF

03:31:26.874 --> 03:31:27.374
TENANTS.

03:31:27.441 --> 03:31:28.375
ON THAT IT'S JUST THE THE

03:31:28.442 --> 03:31:29.877
PROGRAM ITSELF AND AND THE PROMS

03:31:29.943 --> 03:31:30.978
ASSOCIATE WITH IT SO MAYBE

03:31:31.045 --> 03:31:32.312
THERE'S SOMETHING WE CAN DO.

03:31:32.379 --> 03:31:33.847
TO AS A AS A LEGISLATURE'S A

03:31:33.914 --> 03:31:35.682
STATE TO TO MAKE IT SO THAT MORE

03:31:35.749 --> 03:31:37.484
FOLKS ON SECTION EIGHT CAN CAN

03:31:37.551 --> 03:31:39.620
GET INTERPRETER RENTAL HOUSING --

03:31:39.686 --> 03:31:41.221
AND FIVE DISAGREE A LOT WITH THE

03:31:41.288 --> 03:31:42.189
COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM

03:31:42.256 --> 03:31:43.557
DIEGO AGAIN.

03:31:43.624 --> 03:31:44.224
YOU KNOW AT THIS TIME WHEN WE'RE

03:31:44.291 --> 03:31:45.626
FACING -- THE HOMELESSNESS

03:31:45.692 --> 03:31:46.927
CRISIS THAT WE'RE FACING IN THE

03:31:46.994 --> 03:31:52.599
STATE TO TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR

03:31:52.666 --> 03:31:54.301
PH<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;. TO GET A TO HOUSING&lt;/c&gt;</u>

03:31:54.368 --> 03:31:55.502
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE FEDERAL

03:31:55.569 --> 03:31:56.103
GOVERNMENT'S GONNA COME IN A

03:31:56.170 --> 03:31:56.703
CHIP IN THE MONEY I MEAN THAT

THING THAT'S NOT BEING MENTIONED

PLUS REGIONAL CPI.

03:34:52.746 --> 03:34:54.214
AND SO THAT WOULD BE EXTREMELY

03:34:54.281 --> 03:34:55.582
BURDENSOME BECAUSE AGAIN.

03:34:55.649 --> 03:34:57.150

03:35:12.899 --> 03:35:14.067
AND THAT COULD BE X. REALLY

03:35:14.134 --> 03:35:14.635
BURDENSOME FOR THEM AND SO

03:35:14.701 --> 03:35:15.535
THAT'S WHY THIS IS VERY MUCH A A

03:35:15.602 --> 03:35:16.470
LOCAL ISSUE AND AND AGAIN THIS

03:35:16.536 --> 03:35:17.137

MENTIONED -- BY SENATOR

03:35:32.019 --> 03:35:33.687

SECTION EIGHT PROGRAM.

03:35:38.425 --> 03:35:40.294
AND SO WE CURRENTLY HAVE OUR ANY

03:35:40.360 --> 03:35:41.295
OUR NATIONAL ASSOCIATION

03:35:41.361 --> 03:35:43.230

03:36:18.765 --> 03:36:19.633
THAT THIS BILL IS SIMPLY NOT

WORKABLE AND IT IS GOING TO

03:36:21.001 --> 03:36:21.902

OTHER ONEROUS REQUIREMENTS.

03:36:29.509 --> 03:36:31.111
AND WE ALIGN OURSELVES WITH THE

03:36:31.178 --> 03:36:32.546
COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE.

03:36:32.612 --> 03:36:33.647
BY FOUR TERM GOVERNOR JERRY

03:36:33.714 --> 03:36:38.518
BROWN WHEN HE SAID THAT THIS

03:36:38.585 --> 03:36:41.755
BILL DOES CREATE A MANDATE -- TO

03:36:41.822 --> 03:36:43.457

THE ONLY THING -- AT IS --

03:36:49.363 --> 03:36:50.464
PARMER CONCERN TERMS THE MANDATE

03:36:55.135 --> 03:36:57.270

03:37:22.362 --> 03:37:22.929
APPRECIATE YOUR COOPERATION ON

03:37:22.996 --> 03:37:23.463
SOME OF THE OTHER HOUSING

03:37:23.530 --> 03:37:24.531
MEASURES THAT WE'VE HAD -- MOVE

03:37:24.598 --> 03:37:25.065
THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE IN

03:37:25.132 --> 03:37:25.665
THROUGH THE EIGHT THROUGH THE

03:37:25.732 --> 03:37:26.266
LEGISLATURE -- AND IT SOUNDS

03:37:26.333 --> 03:37:27.634
LIKE TO ME THAT THE REAL -- AREA

03:37:27.701 --> 03:37:28.201
OF EMPHASIS NEEDS TO BE ON

03:37:28.268 --> 03:37:28.735
FIXING THE PROBLEM AT THE

03:37:28.802 --> 03:37:29.803
FEDERAL LEVEL AND SO -- YOU KNOW

03:37:29.870 --> 03:37:30.904
WHAT WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE AT

03:37:30.971 --> 03:37:31.705
THE STATE LEVEL TO ME SEEMS

03:37:31.772 --> 03:37:32.906
REASONABLE TEAMS APPROPRIATE IT

03:37:32.973 --> 03:37:34.341
SEEMS FAIRLY MODEST.

03:37:34.408 --> 03:37:35.542
AND YOU KNOW WITH THERE'S

03:37:35.609 --> 03:37:36.710
ANYTHING WE CAN DO I'M CERTAINLY

03:37:36.777 --> 03:37:38.044
OPEN TO TO HAVING CONVERSATIONS

03:37:38.111 --> 03:37:39.312
ABOUT THAT I THINK OTHERS WOULD

03:37:39.379 --> 03:37:50.056
BE IF THERE ARE THINGS WE CAN DO.

03:37:50.123 --> 03:37:50.657
TO TO MAKE THIS PROGRAM WORK

03:37:50.724 --> 03:37:52.025
BETTER FOR MORE FOLKS SO THAT

03:37:52.092 --> 03:37:52.592
MORE FOLKS WAS SECTION EIGHT

03:37:52.659 --> 03:37:53.794
VOUCHERS CAN GET INTO HOUSING IN

03:37:53.860 --> 03:37:54.628
A WAY THAT WORKS. FOR FOR THE

03:37:54.694 --> 03:37:56.029
OWNERS OF THE HOUSING I THINK

03:37:56.096 --> 03:37:57.164
THAT'S GREAT BY -- YOU KNOW

03:37:57.230 --> 03:37:58.165
SEEING SEEING AND LISTENING TO

03:37:58.231 --> 03:38:01.067
THE TESTIMONY TODAY I THINK WHEN

03:38:01.134 --> 03:38:03.570
A SUPPORT THIS BILL.

03:38:03.637 --> 03:38:04.137
NUMBER SCORE SO HAS ONE MORE

03:38:04.204 --> 03:38:05.739
QUESTION.

03:38:05.806 --> 03:38:06.840
YEAH JUST ON THE POINT THAT WAS

03:38:06.907 --> 03:38:08.141
JUST BROUGHT UP RELATED -- TO

03:38:08.208 --> 03:38:11.511
THE RENT INCREASES.

03:38:11.578 --> 03:38:13.513
CONTROL HE WANTS IT THAT WAY --

03:38:13.580 --> 03:38:17.417
RELATED TO OUR YOUR BILL THIS.

03:38:17.484 --> 03:38:18.685
GENTLEMAN JUST SAID.

03:38:18.752 --> 03:38:19.252
BE IN A SITUATION WHERE THE

03:38:19.319 --> 03:38:20.687
VOUCHER SAYS ONE THING BUT RIGHT

03:38:20.754 --> 03:38:21.488
SO.

03:38:21.555 --> 03:38:22.289
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE --

03:38:22.355 --> 03:38:22.856
WITH REGARD TO THE PAYMENT

03:38:22.923 --> 03:38:23.957
STANDARDS ON SECTION EIGHT

03:38:24.024 --> 03:38:25.225
VOUCHERS THERE'S AN IMPORTANT

03:38:25.292 --> 03:38:26.793
REASON THAT THOSE ARE IN PLACE

03:38:26.860 --> 03:38:28.028
WHICH IS TO ENSURE THAT THAT

03:38:28.094 --> 03:38:29.563
GOVERNMENT FUNDS ARE NOT BEING

03:38:29.629 --> 03:38:32.365
USED TO ESSENTIALLY OVER PAY.

03:38:32.432 --> 03:38:33.533
FOR PRIVATE APARTMENTS THAT'S

03:38:33.600 --> 03:38:36.002
VERY DIFFERENT THAN SAYING THE

03:38:36.069 --> 03:38:37.838
HOUSING AUTHORITY MANDATES WHAT

03:38:37.904 --> 03:38:39.206
A LANDMARK IN CHARGE SO ABOUT

03:38:39.272 --> 03:38:40.340
HER COMES WITH A PAYMENT

03:38:40.407 --> 03:38:41.541
STANDARD MEANING THAT'S THE

03:38:41.608 --> 03:38:44.878
MAXIMUM RENT THAT -- THE HOUSING

03:38:44.945 --> 03:38:46.580
AUTHORITY IS GOING TO PAY FOR A

03:38:46.646 --> 03:38:47.647
GIVEN APARTMENT.

03:38:47.714 --> 03:38:48.548
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THAT'S

03:38:48.615 --> 03:38:50.083
THE MAXIMUM RENT THAT A LANDMARK

03:38:50.150 --> 03:38:51.551
IN CHARGE THAT MEANS THAT WHEN

03:38:51.618 --> 03:38:53.220
THE VOUCHER HOLDER THEMSELF IS

03:38:53.286 --> 03:38:54.754
SHOPPING FOR APARTMENTS.

03:38:54.821 --> 03:38:55.789
JUST LIKE WHEN I'M SHOPPING FOR

03:38:55.856 --> 03:38:57.357
AN APARTMENT THEY HAVE TO FIND A

03:38:57.424 --> 03:38:58.625
PLACE THAT THEY CAN AFFORD

03:38:58.692 --> 03:39:00.627
WITHOUT VOUCHER -- SO IF THERE

03:39:00.694 --> 03:39:02.329
IS RENT BEING CHARGED OVER AND

03:39:02.395 --> 03:39:03.763
ABOVE THAT PAYMENT STANDARD THAT

03:39:03.830 --> 03:39:04.931
JUST MEANS THAT THAT WILL NOT BE

03:39:04.998 --> 03:39:05.866
A UNIT THAT THE HOUSING

03:39:05.932 --> 03:39:07.801
AUTHORITY CAN PAY FOR UNDER THAT

03:39:07.868 --> 03:39:08.568
PROGRAM.

03:39:08.635 --> 03:39:09.803
SO IT'S A IT'S A IT'S AN ISSUE

03:39:09.870 --> 03:39:12.772
FOR THE TENANT NOT NECESSARILY

03:39:12.839 --> 03:39:16.476
FOR THE LANDMARK.

03:39:16.543 --> 03:39:17.911
ALL RIGHT AND JUST WHAT JUST ONE

03:39:17.978 --> 03:39:21.548
MORE -- NOT QUESTION BUT ON THIS

03:39:21.615 --> 03:39:24.050
BILL WOULD TAKE OFF THE

03:39:24.117 --> 03:39:27.521
DISCLAIMER OR THE LANGUAGE.

03:39:27.587 --> 03:39:29.890
ON WHEN SOMEBODY'S LOOKING FOR

03:39:29.956 --> 03:39:31.091
AN APARTMENT SAYING THAT YOU

03:39:31.157 --> 03:39:36.997
CANNOT -- THAT THEY DON'T ACCEPT --

03:39:37.063 --> 03:39:40.467
SECTION DATE BUT IS THERE A

03:39:40.534 --> 03:39:42.869
POSSIBILITY. TWO I DON'T KNOW IF

03:39:42.936 --> 03:39:44.137
IT WOULD BE IN THE APPLICATION

03:39:44.204 --> 03:39:45.672
OR SOMEWHERE ELSE I'M NOT TRYING

03:39:45.739 --> 03:39:47.607
TO MEND IT WELL WE'RE HERE BUT

03:39:47.674 --> 03:39:51.011
JUST AS AN OPTION IS. TO LET THE

03:39:51.077 --> 03:39:53.413
LANDLORDS KNOW THAT THEY'RE NOT

03:39:53.480 --> 03:39:55.582
FORCED TO TAKE IT.

03:39:55.649 --> 03:39:56.449
SECTION.

03:39:56.516 --> 03:39:58.251
EIGHT HE SAID I'M SAYING THE ONE

03:39:58.318 --> 03:40:00.120
PART IS JUST SAY THEY'RE NOT

03:40:00.186 --> 03:40:01.988
DISCRIMINATING.

03:40:02.055 --> 03:40:02.822
THAT OFF THAT OUT I THINK IT

03:40:02.889 --> 03:40:05.458
GOES BACK TO THE TO THE TO THE

03:40:05.525 --> 03:40:06.760
AS THE REPRESENTED FROM KERR

03:40:06.826 --> 03:40:08.228
SAID WE HAVE TO AGREE TO

03:40:08.295 --> 03:40:10.196
DISAGREE WITH INTERPRETATION OF

03:40:10.263 --> 03:40:11.031
THE LAW.

03:40:11.097 --> 03:40:13.400
AND IT'S OUR ARGUMENT THAT IT IT

03:40:13.466 --> 03:40:15.302
IS NOT A MANDATE [inaudible]

03:40:15.368 --> 03:40:16.836
ANA.

03:40:16.903 --> 03:40:18.572
AND I KNOW THE CAR IN THE

03:40:18.638 --> 03:40:20.073
APARTMENT SO SEE ATION IT'S BEEN

03:40:20.140 --> 03:40:22.042
A GREAT DEAL OF TIME -- DOING

03:40:22.108 --> 03:40:24.945
WORKSHOPS EDUCATING -- APARTMENT

03:40:25.011 --> 03:40:26.980
OWNERS AND LANDLORDS ABOUT

03:40:27.047 --> 03:40:27.948
CURRENT LAW.

03:40:28.014 --> 03:40:29.883
I WOULD HOPE THAT IF THIS WERE

03:40:29.950 --> 03:40:30.784
TO BECOME LAW THAT THEY WOULD DO

03:40:30.850 --> 03:40:32.452
THEIR DUE DILIGENCE TO MAKE SURE

03:40:32.519 --> 03:40:34.120
THAT LANDLORDS ACROSS THE STATE

03:40:34.187 --> 03:40:35.889
WHO WHO PAY FEES AND LOOK TO

03:40:35.956 --> 03:40:38.625
THEM -- TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON

03:40:38.692 --> 03:40:41.127
HOW CURRENT IN NEW LOS IMPACT ON

03:40:41.194 --> 03:40:42.462
THEIR ABILITY TO DO BUSINESS

03:40:42.529 --> 03:40:43.997
WOULD INFORM THEM OF THAT BUT

03:40:44.064 --> 03:40:45.398
AGAIN I THINK IT GETS BACK TO

03:40:45.465 --> 03:40:46.666
THIS CORE ISSUE.

03:40:46.733 --> 03:40:47.968
IT IS NOT A MANDATE AND WE'RE

03:40:48.034 --> 03:40:51.071
CLEAR THAT THE LANGUAGE SUPPORTS

03:40:51.137 --> 03:40:53.974
THAT.

03:40:54.040 --> 03:40:55.842
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.

03:40:55.909 --> 03:40:57.344
COLLEAGUES APPRECIATE THE

03:40:57.410 --> 03:40:58.845
DISCUSSION I KNOW MANY OF YOU

03:40:58.912 --> 03:41:00.180
HAVE BEEN GRAPPLING WITH THIS

03:41:00.246 --> 03:41:01.581
AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR

03:41:01.648 --> 03:41:03.116
FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT ON THIS AND

03:41:03.183 --> 03:41:04.284
AND LET ME SAYAT THE OUTSET.

03:41:04.351 --> 03:41:05.685
I'VE BEEN A CO AUTHOR OF THIS

03:41:05.752 --> 03:41:07.587
BILL SINCE THE BEGINNING I VERY

03:41:07.654 --> 03:41:08.989
RARELY CO AUTHOR BILLS THAT COME

03:41:09.055 --> 03:41:09.956
THROUGH THIS HOUSING COMMITTEE

03:41:10.023 --> 03:41:12.025
BUT THIS IS ONE THAT I DO THINK --

03:41:12.092 --> 03:41:13.093
AND AGREE WITH OUR COLLEAGUE

03:41:13.159 --> 03:41:14.861
FROM SAN DIEGO IS IS VERY

03:41:14.928 --> 03:41:17.263
IMPORTANT AND LET ME JUST FIRST

03:41:17.330 --> 03:41:18.531
ADDRESS I THINK A FEW

03:41:18.598 --> 03:41:20.867
MISCONCEPTIONS I LET ME JUST

03:41:20.934 --> 03:41:22.402
READ FROM THE ANALYSIS.

03:41:22.469 --> 03:41:24.037
THE AUTHOR THIS BILL HAS STATED

03:41:24.104 --> 03:41:27.273
IN HER HER OWN ANALYSIS OR HER --

03:41:27.340 --> 03:41:29.042
FACT SHEET THIS BILL DOES NOT

03:41:29.109 --> 03:41:30.443
REQUIRE LANDLORDS TO ACCEPT ANY

03:41:30.510 --> 03:41:31.711
TENANTS WITH HOUSING ASSISTANCE

03:41:31.778 --> 03:41:33.246
DOES NOT PROHIBIT LANDLORDS FROM

03:41:33.313 --> 03:41:34.781
SCREENING FOR SUITABILITY DOES

03:41:34.848 --> 03:41:36.149
NOTHING TO PREVENT LANDLORDS

03:41:36.216 --> 03:41:37.417
FROM SETTING THEIR RENTS.

03:41:37.484 --> 03:41:39.219
A DESIRE LEVELS THERE WAS AN

03:41:39.285 --> 03:41:40.186
EXAMPLE I THINK OUR VICE CHAIR

03:41:40.253 --> 03:41:41.955
IT'S SUGGESTED THAT SOMEHOW THIS

03:41:42.022 --> 03:41:43.690
BILL WAS A CAN TO FORCING --

03:41:43.757 --> 03:41:44.791
SOMEONE PROVIDE HEALTH CARE AT A

03:41:44.858 --> 03:41:46.126
DOLLAR THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS

03:41:46.192 --> 03:41:48.461
BILL IS ABOUT THIS BILL SAYS.

03:41:48.528 --> 03:41:49.596
THAT YOU SHOULDN'T DISCRIMINATE

03:41:49.663 --> 03:41:52.132
AGAINST SOMEONE IF YOU HAVE THE

03:41:52.198 --> 03:41:55.068
ABILITY. TO A YOU HAVE -- THE

03:41:55.135 --> 03:41:57.704
FEDERAL ASSISTANCE YOU SHOULD

03:41:57.771 --> 03:41:59.072
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST SOME AND

03:41:59.139 --> 03:42:00.640
MISS QUIRK SILVA I DO THINK HAD

03:42:00.707 --> 03:42:02.142
RAISED.

03:42:02.208 --> 03:42:02.942
THE CHALLENGE AROUND THE

03:42:03.009 --> 03:42:04.544
NARRATIVE AND AND LET ME SUGGEST

03:42:04.611 --> 03:42:06.179
A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO

03:42:06.246 --> 03:42:07.213
THINK ABOUT THE NARRATIVE.

03:42:07.280 --> 03:42:08.682
CURRENT LAW SAYS YOU CAN'T

03:42:08.748 --> 03:42:09.983
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST SOMEONE

03:42:10.050 --> 03:42:12.352
BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE OR THEIR

03:42:12.419 --> 03:42:13.820
GENDER OR THEIR NATIONALITY BUT

03:42:13.887 --> 03:42:16.156
YOU'RE NOT REQUIRED. TO RENT TO

03:42:16.222 --> 03:42:17.590
SOMEONE BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE

03:42:17.657 --> 03:42:19.626
THEIR GENDER OR NATIONALITY IT

03:42:19.693 --> 03:42:21.294
SIMPLY SAYS GIVE THEM A FAIR

03:42:21.361 --> 03:42:22.429
SHOT.

03:42:22.495 --> 03:42:23.697
DON'T HAVE A SIGN ON THE DOOR

03:42:23.763 --> 03:42:25.365
THAT SAYS YOU CAN'T EVEN SUBMIT

03:42:25.432 --> 03:42:26.666
YOUR APPLICATION.

03:42:26.733 --> 03:42:32.806
WE'RE JUST ASKING FOLKS TO SAY

03:42:32.872 --> 03:42:34.207
PUT ASIDE WHATEVER.

03:42:34.274 --> 03:42:35.542
STEREOTYPES YOU MAY HAVE AROUND

03:42:35.608 --> 03:42:36.409
SECTION EIGHT HOUSING APPLICANTS.

03:42:36.476 --> 03:42:36.976
YOU KNOW THAT THEY HAVE THE

03:42:37.043 --> 03:42:38.912
ABILITY TO PAY THAT PORTION WITH

03:42:38.978 --> 03:42:39.879
THE FEDERAL ASSISTANCE AND THEY

03:42:39.946 --> 03:42:40.380
HAVE.

03:42:40.447 --> 03:42:41.748
OTHER ABILITIES POTENTIALLY TO

03:42:41.815 --> 03:42:44.150
PAY FOR THE BALANCE BUT GIVE

03:42:44.217 --> 03:42:46.786
THEM A FAIR SHOT -- AND IN MY

03:42:46.853 --> 03:42:48.988
MIND THAT'S ALL THIS DOES I HAVE

03:42:49.055 --> 03:42:51.324
FULL FAITH IN THE RENTAL HOUSING

03:42:51.391 --> 03:42:52.659
INDUSTRY THAT IF THIS WERE TO GO

03:42:52.726 --> 03:42:54.360
INTO EFFECT.

03:42:54.427 --> 03:42:55.595
THE MEMBERS OF THE ROW HOUSING

03:42:55.662 --> 03:42:57.097
INDUSTRY WOULD BE EDUCATED ON

03:42:57.163 --> 03:42:58.598
ALL OF THESE NUANCES OF THE LAW

03:42:58.665 --> 03:43:00.200
AND THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND.

03:43:00.266 --> 03:43:01.134
THAT THEY CAN'T PUT A SIGN UP

03:43:01.201 --> 03:43:03.336
THAT SAYS THOU SHALL NOT APPLY.

03:43:03.403 --> 03:43:05.905
THEY NEED TO GIVE PEOPLE AN

03:43:05.972 --> 03:43:07.307
OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY.

03:43:07.373 --> 03:43:09.909
BUT THEY CAN MAKE A DECISION AS

03:43:09.976 --> 03:43:10.410
THEY WOULD IN ANY OTHER

03:43:10.477 --> 03:43:11.211
CIRCUMSTANCE.

03:43:11.277 --> 03:43:12.912
REGARDLESS OF SOMEONE'S RACE OR

03:43:12.979 --> 03:43:14.514
RELIGION OR NATIONALITY OR ANY

03:43:14.581 --> 03:43:15.381
OF THE OTHER ENUMERATED

03:43:15.448 --> 03:43:16.716
CATEGORIES THAT ARE PROTECTED

03:43:16.783 --> 03:43:18.718
UNDER CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS AND SO I

03:43:18.785 --> 03:43:21.187
KNOW THAT'S A CONCEPT THAT'S

03:43:21.254 --> 03:43:22.822
BEEN A BIT DIFFICULT.

03:43:22.889 --> 03:43:23.389
FOR I THINK MEMBERS OF THE

03:43:23.456 --> 03:43:24.924
PUBLIC TO GRAPPLE WITH BUT

ALL OF US WHO ARE SUPPORTIVE OF

03:43:58.958 --> 03:44:00.026
THE SECTION EIGHT PROGRAM ABOUT

03:44:00.093 --> 03:44:01.528
SOME ELEMENTS THAT POTENTIALLY

03:44:01.594 --> 03:44:02.896
COULD BE ADDED IN THERE BY OUR

03:44:02.962 --> 03:44:04.397
NEW FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION SO I

03:44:04.464 --> 03:44:06.366

THE HOUSING BILLS THAT CAR IS

03:44:19.879 --> 03:44:21.981
SUPPORTIVE OF ON AS I BELIEVE

03:44:22.048 --> 03:44:23.583
YOU SHOULD BE -- THEN I BUT I

03:44:23.650 --> 03:44:24.484
MUST KNOW BECAUSE I THINK IT'S

03:44:24.551 --> 03:44:27.520
DISINGENUOUS TO REFERENCE A VETO

03:44:27.587 --> 03:44:29.122
FROM A FOUR TERM GOVERNOR OF THE

03:44:29.189 --> 03:44:30.657
BILL THAT ACCORDING TO THE

03:44:30.723 --> 03:44:32.692
ANALYSIS FROM OF THE HOUSING

03:44:32.759 --> 03:44:33.893
COMMITTEE IN THE SENATE YOU WERE

03:44:33.960 --> 03:44:36.095
LISTED IN OPPOSITION TO FROM THE

03:44:36.162 --> 03:44:39.032
BEGINNING ANYWAY -- WITH REGARD

03:44:39.098 --> 03:44:40.567
TO SUSPENSION OF PAYMENTS.

03:44:40.633 --> 03:44:41.801
I MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THAT

03:44:41.868 --> 03:44:43.636
ONLY OCCURS AFTER REPEATED

03:44:43.703 --> 03:44:45.772
NOTICE AND THE EXAMPLE OF

03:44:45.839 --> 03:44:51.811
GRAFFITI WAS AN INTERESTING --

03:44:51.878 --> 03:44:52.846
ONE IT IN YOUR PRIVATE RESIDENCE

03:44:52.912 --> 03:44:54.414
IN MANY MUNICIPALITIES ACROSS

03:44:54.480 --> 03:44:55.415
THE STATE RIGHT HERE IN

03:44:55.481 --> 03:44:57.150
SACRAMENTO THE NEIGHBORING CITY

03:44:57.217 --> 03:44:59.519
OF WOODLAND ALL WE HAVE EXAMPLES

03:44:59.586 --> 03:45:01.387
OF GRAFFITI BEING.

03:45:01.454 --> 03:45:03.857
VISIBLE ON AN EXTERIOR WALL WITH

03:45:03.923 --> 03:45:05.425
THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

03:45:05.491 --> 03:45:07.527
INFORMED THE HOMEOWNER THAT THEY

03:45:07.594 --> 03:45:08.928
HAD AN OBLIGATION TO REMOVE THE

03:45:08.995 --> 03:45:10.129
GRAFFITI WITHIN A CERTAIN AMOUNT

03:45:10.196 --> 03:45:11.764
OF TIME OR THEY WOULD BE FINED

03:45:11.831 --> 03:45:13.566
BY LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT.

03:45:13.633 --> 03:45:14.834
AND SO THE GRAFFITI EXAMPLE I

03:45:14.901 --> 03:45:16.169
THINK WAS INTERESTING BUT LET ME

03:45:16.236 --> 03:45:17.971
BE CLEAR THAT SUSPENSION OF

03:45:18.037 --> 03:45:19.505
PAYMENTS DOES NOT OCCUR.

03:45:19.572 --> 03:45:21.341
UNTIL REPEATED NOTICES HAVE BEEN

03:45:21.407 --> 03:45:23.243
ISSUED ALSO WITH REGARD TO

03:45:23.309 --> 03:45:26.346
GRAFFITI I I AM A LANDLORD IN

03:45:26.412 --> 03:45:27.847
THE MUNICIPALITY THAT REQUIRES

03:45:27.914 --> 03:45:29.349
ANNUAL INSPECTIONS.

03:45:29.415 --> 03:45:32.385
AND THOSE ANNUAL INSPECTIONS.

03:45:32.452 --> 03:45:34.220
NOT THE SECTION EIGHT INSPECTION

03:45:34.287 --> 03:45:35.989
THE REGULAR ANNUAL INSPECTION

03:45:36.055 --> 03:45:38.925
ALSO WOULD HOLD ME ACCOUNTABLE

03:45:38.992 --> 03:45:41.294
WITH REGARD TO GRAFFITI SO THAT

03:45:41.361 --> 03:45:43.596
WOULD BE AN ISSUE JUST AS A

03:45:43.663 --> 03:45:46.766
REGULAR LANDLORDS -- WHETHER YOU

03:45:46.833 --> 03:45:48.601
ARE TAKING A SECTION.

03:45:48.668 --> 03:45:50.637
EIGHT TENANT OR NOT.

03:45:50.703 --> 03:45:52.138
SENATOR PORTANTINO'S BILL IS A

03:45:52.205 --> 03:45:54.407
GREAT IDEA I HAPPILY VOTED FOR

03:45:54.474 --> 03:45:55.975
IT LET ME BE CLEAR THAT THE TWO

03:45:56.042 --> 03:45:58.945
BILLS ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE.

03:45:59.012 --> 03:46:00.847
IT'S IMPORTANT WHAT REGARD TO

03:46:00.914 --> 03:46:02.382
INSPECTIONS I THINK ALL OF US

03:46:02.448 --> 03:46:04.484
HAVE A FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY

03:46:04.550 --> 03:46:06.552
TO UPHOLD THE KIND OF INTEGRITY

03:46:06.619 --> 03:46:08.288
OF THE USE OF PUBLIC FUNDS AND

03:46:08.354 --> 03:46:09.989
THAT WE WOULD WANT INSPECTIONS

03:46:10.056 --> 03:46:12.091
USED. FOR PRIVATE PROPERTY WHERE

03:46:12.158 --> 03:46:13.793
PUBLIC DOLLARS ARE GOING TO BE

03:46:13.860 --> 03:46:15.862
USED TO PAY THE RENT WE WOULD

03:46:15.929 --> 03:46:18.298
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE.

03:46:18.364 --> 03:46:20.533
GUARANTEEING THAT THOSE

03:46:20.600 --> 03:46:21.868
RESOURCES ARE BEING SPENT.

03:46:21.935 --> 03:46:25.571
IN HABITABLE -- PREMISES I THINK

03:46:25.638 --> 03:46:27.240
THAT'S OUR COLLECTIVE

03:46:27.307 --> 03:46:28.541
RESPONSIBILITY.

03:46:28.608 --> 03:46:32.278
AGAIN WITH REGARD TO THE DELAYS --

03:46:32.345 --> 03:46:33.246
THAT IT REQUIRES AYE.

03:46:33.313 --> 03:46:35.548
