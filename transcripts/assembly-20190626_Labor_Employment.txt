THIS ON THE COMMITTEE ON LABOR EMPLOYMENT. EATING TO ORDER -- WE WILL START AS A SUB COMMITTEE -- AND RESPECT FOR OUR SENATORS HERE'S WELL AS OTHERS THAT ARE HERE IN THE AUDIENCE -- AND SO I'D LIKE TO INVITE UP SENATOR JACKSON'S. TO PRESENT SB ONE SEVENTY ONE AND OF COURSE ONCE WE GET A QUORUM -- WELL ESTABLISHED THAT AND AND PROCEED TO CONVERT THANK YOU SO SENATOR WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I AM HERE TODAY TO PRESENT SB ONE SEVENTY ONE IT'S A BILL VERY SIMILAR TO A BILL THIS COMMITTEE ACTUALLY SAW LAST YEAR. IT'S A BILL TO FIGHT PAY DISCRIMINATION WITH DATA. WITH INFORMATION. BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO PAY A QUICK EQUITY FOR WOMEN AND MINORITIES WE CAN'T FIX WHAT WE DON'T KNOW. IT WILL REQUIRE EMPLOYERS WITH A HUNDRED EMPLOYEES ARE MORE SHOVEL FAIRLY ROBUST COMPANY. TO MORE -- EXCUSE ME TO SUBMIT A PAY DATA REPORT ANNUALLY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING. OUTLINING THE COMPENSATION AN HOUR'S WORK TO OF EMPLOYEES BY GENDER. RACE ETHNICITY AND JOB CATEGORY. AND THE GOAL IS TWO FOLD FIRST TO ENCOURAGE EMPLOYERS TO ANALYZE THEIR OWN PAY PRACTICES AND ALLOW FOR SELF CORRECTION. PUT THAT MIRROR IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE AND SHE JUST EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING. AND IF YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING THAT IS UNLAWFUL OR CREATES DIS DESPARD WORKING OPPORTUNITIES MAKE THOSE CORRECTIONS. NOBODY ELSE HAS TO REALLY KNOW ABOUT IT YOU FILE YOUR ANNUAL REPORT. YOU MAKE THE CORRECTIONS AND YOU OF ACCOMPLISH WHAT THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO DO. AND NUMBER TWO IT WILL ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING TOGETHER IMPORTANT DATA THAT ALLOWS THEM TO SEE PATTERNS OF WAGE DISPARITIES IF THEY EXIST. AND IF THEY NOTICED DEVIATIONS OR OUT LIARS TO BE ABLE TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER AGAIN WITH THE HOPE THAT IF COMPANIES SEE THAT THEY ARE NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH OUR FAIR PAY LAWS. AND WHERE THERE'S DISPARITY IN INCOME AND JOB SEGREGATION THAT THEY WILL MAKE THOSE CORRECTIONS IN IT ESSENTIALLY AN INCENTIVIZE BUT REALLY VOLUNTARY WAY. SO THE INFORMATION THEN WOULD ALSO BE AVAILABLE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT IF THEY REQUESTED. THE BILL IS CLOSELY MODELED ACTUALLY AFTER EFFORTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. NOT RECOGNIZING THAT UNEQUAL PAY IS OFTEN HIDDEN TO EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED A PROPER PROPOSED REVISION TO A DEMOGRAPHIC REPORT. THAT LARGE EMPLOYERS HAVE BEEN SUBMITTING FOR MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS. IT'S THE EMPLOYER INFORMATION REPORT KNOWN AS THE E. E. O.. ONE AN AIDE EXPANDED IT TO INCLUDE THE REPORTING OF PAY DATA BY RACE AND GENDER BEGINNING IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN SIMPLY EXPANDING REPORT THE COMPANIES HAVE BEEN DOING FOR YEARS. SO IT'S NOTHING NEW IT JUST SIMPLY ADDS TWO CATEGORIES RACE AND GENDER. BUT IN AUGUST TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SAID EQUAL PAY EFFORTS BACK BY PUTTING A WHOLE TO THIS NEW RULE. THE NATIONAL WOMEN'S LAW CENTER SUIT. ARGUING THAT THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT BUDGET LACKED A GOOD CAUSE TO STAY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PAY DATA COLLECTION. BUT IN MARCH A FEDERAL JUDGE ORDERED THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. TO MOVE FORWARD WITH COLLECTING THIS IMPORTANT DATA. CITING THE EXTENSIVE PREPARATION STUDY AND IN PORT THERE WENT INTO THE CREATION OF THIS DATA REVISION. AND DECLARING THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT BUDGETS DECISION TO HALT THE PROGRAMME. ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS. SOMETHING WE'VE NEVER HEARD ABOUT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION I'M SURE. BUT IN THIS CASE THE COURT ACTUALLY MADE A RULING. AND THIS DISH DECISION MAY BE APPEALED BUT NONE THE LESS THE COLLECTION OF THIS IDENTICAL PAID OUT OF REQUESTED UNDER THIS BILL. IS NOW UNDER WAY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IN SB ONE SEVENTY ONE WILL ENSURE THIS DATA IS ALSO IN THE HANDS OF OUR STATE AGENCIES. AN EMPLOYER MAY COMPLY WITH THIS BE ONE SEVENTY ONE BY SIMPLY SUBMITTING TO THE STATE A COPY OF THEIR E. O. ONE FORM. THIS IS ABOUT AS EASY AS IT GETS TO COMPLY. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT BASED ON SOME OF THE INFO -- MISINFORMATION OUT -- FOR TO KNOW WHAT THIS BILL IS NOT. IT IS NOT ABOUT PUBLIC EXPOSURE. OR TRAINING. SOME MIGHT THINK THIS WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA AND I DON'T NECESSARILY DISAGREE. BUT I DON'T FEEL THAT WE NEED TO QUITE GET THERE AT LEAST AT THIS FIRST POINT PRELIMINARILY IT MAY BE SOMETHING WE NEED TO DO GOING FORWARD. BUT I LIKE TO THINK THAT MOST OF THESE COMPANIES DON'T COMPLY WITH THE LAW SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW ALL. AND NOT THAT IT'S INTENTIONAL THAT MAY BE WRONG BUT I'M WILLING TO GIVE IT A CHANCE AND SO THIS BILL REALLY ISN'T ABOUT INCENTIVES. ARE THIS BILL WILL NOT EXPOSE INFORMATION THAT IS INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE BY BUSINESSES NOR WILL EXPOSE EMPLOYEES PRIVATE FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC. I'VE EVEN TAKEN THE UNUSUAL STEP OF PROHIBITING A PUBLIC RECORD ACT DISCLOSURE. SO AGAIN MY GOAL HERE IS TO GET COMPLIANCE AND IT'S MY HOPE THAT THIS WILL BE. AS EFFECTIVE AWAY AND IF NOT FRANKLY I'M PREPARED TO TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A HARSHER STICK -- THAN THE CARROT THAT WERE OFFERING THE LIMITING OF PUBLIC AVAILABILITY OF THE REPORTS IS SIMILAR TO ACTUALLY WHAT OCCURS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WHERE THEY'VE HAD NO ISSUES WITH ON TOWARD DISCLOSURE OF THIS DATA. IN THE FIFTY PLUS YEARS SINCE THIS OP FORM IS BEEN REQUIRED. BUT WHAT THE DATA WILL PROVIDE AS I MENTION IS A BIRD'S-EYE VIEW TO PAY DISPARITIES AND OCCUPATIONAL SEGREGATION. BUT IT DOESN'T DO IT IN A GRANULAR WAY SO YOU CAN IDENTIFY ANY PARTICULAR PERSON THE INFORMATION HERE IS NOT INTENDED AND CANNOT BE USED TO ENFORCE THE CALIFORNIA FAIR PAY ACT. AGAIN WE'RE LOOKING AT LARGER CATEGORIES FROM THE THIRTY THOUSAND POINT OF FOOD VIEW. AND THE KIND OF INFORMATION. ABOUT SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR WORK BONA FIDE REASONS FOR PAYING ONE EMPLOYING MORE THAN ANOTHER ISN'T ASKED FOR IN THIS REPORT. EMPLOYERS WILL NOT BE EXPOSED IN THAT MANNER I KNOW WE'VE HEARD OLD THE SKY IS FALLING IT IS NOT THEY'VE BEEN DOING THE EO ONE FORM FOR YEARS. THIS IS A TOOL TO SHED LIGHT ON TRENDS AND THE BIG PICTURE. THIS IS A MEASURE TO ENSURE WE MOVE TOWARD THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF NOT ONLY WILL PAY BUT OF CLOSING THE GAP IN JOB SEGREGATION THAT WE KNOW EXISTS BUT HOPEFULLY COMPANIES WHEN THEY SEE IT EXISTING WITHIN THEIR OWN ENTITIES. WILL MAKE THE NECESSARY CORRECTIONS THIS IS A BILL. BASICALLY TO ENSURE THAT THE LAWS FOLLOWED IN WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I TALKED THANK YOU CENTER JACKSON'S IMPOSSIBLE MOMENT AND ESTABLISH QUORUM AND SECRETARY. KALRA HERE FLORA. CARILLO. YEP [inaudible] GONZALEZ. JONES SAWYER THREE OF US FOR MR. THANK YOU -- WE DO HAVE QUORUM ESTABLISHED AND AS WE GO ON CHAIR WITNESSES SAID THE THE WAY WE OPERATE HERE AS WE ALLOW UP TO SIX MINUTES. YOU CAN DIVVY IT UP ANY WAY YOU CHOOSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE ALL THE SIX MINUTES WE DON'T USE BUT PLEASE -- PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JESSICA STENDER AND I'M AN ATTORNEY EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES PROUD SPONSOR THIS BILL -- I'M GONNA FOCUS MY TESTIMONY A LITTLE BIT ON THE BACKGROUND ABOUT HOW THIS BILL CAME ABOUT AND WHY IT WILL HELP ADDRESS SOME OF THE MAJOR CONTRIBUTING FACTORS. TO THIS GENDER AND RACIAL WAGE GAP THAT WE SEE PERSISTING OVERTIME AND CLOSING AT A VERY SLOW PACE. FIRST I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE EXTENSIVE STUDY AN ANALYSIS THAT WENT INTO THE FEDERAL RULE THAT SENATOR JACKSON MENTIONED. THE PROCESS STARTED BACK IN TWENTY TEN WHEN THE EOC JOINED OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES TO IDENTIFY WAYS TO IMPROVE ENFORCEMENT OF OUR FEDERAL PAY DISCRIMINATION LAWS. THEY ENGAGE THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES TO ISSUE A REPORT THAT THAT BASICALLY RECOGNIZE ENFORCEMENT VALUE OF COLLECTING THIS KIND OF PAY DATA BROKEN DOWN BY SEX RACE AND ETHNICITY -- THE EOC ENGAGE IN A FIVE YEAR VALUATION PROCESS WHICH INCLUDED PUBLIC COMMENT CONSULTATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND EXPERTS A PILOT STUDY AND THEY CAME OUT WITH SOME TECHNICAL RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO THE MOST AFFECTED PAY DATA TO COLLECT. AND THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO DO IT TO CREATE THE LEAST BURDEN ON EMPLOYERS SO THAT'S WHAT WENT INTO THIS FORM THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL NOW IS IS -- BASED ON THIS CALIFORNIA BILL SO WHY IS THE INFORMATION IMPORTANT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT EQUAL PAY WERE OFTEN TALKING ABOUT ONE WOMAN AND ONE MAN OR ONE PERSON OF ONE RACE AND ONE PERSON ANOTHER RACE. PERFORMING SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR WORK BUT BEING PAID DIFFERENT AMOUNTS AND THAT IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM THAT WE KNOW IT EXISTS -- BUT ANOTHER PROBLEM THAT ISN'T SO DISCUSSES THIS ISSUE THAT CENTER JACKSON MENTIONED OF OCCUPATIONAL SEGREGATION WHERE BY WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE OFTEN PREDOMINATED IN OVER CONCENTRATED. IN LOWER PAYING OCCUPATIONS WITHIN A COMPANY OR EVEN ACROSS AN INDUSTRY. ON THIS CAN BE DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS SOMETIMES UNCONSCIOUS BIAS A RECRUITING HIRING AND PROMOTION PRACTICES AND OTHER STRUCTURAL BARRIERS THAT EMPLOYERS THEMSELVES MAY NOT EVEN BE AWARE. EXIST WITHIN THEIR COMPANIES SO AS YOU'VE HEARD THIS TYPE OF PAY DATA THIS HIGH LEVEL DATA WILL HELP COMPANIES IDENTIFY THESE TRENDS THAT ARE OFTEN UNDETECTED AND THEN TAKES STEPS TO CHANGE THEIR COURSE -- THEY MIGHT NOT NECESSARILY SHOWN EQUAL PAY ACT VIOLATION BUT THEY WILL PROMPT COMPANIES POTENTIALLY CHANGE THEIR PAY PROMOTION HIRING PRACTICES TO BETTER REPRESENT WORKERS AT ALL LEVELS OF PAY WITHIN THEIR COMPANIES. BUSINESS IS A RECOGNIZE THE UTILITY OF DOING THIS WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF EXAMPLES IN THE PUBLIC OF BIG COMPANIES INCLUDING SALES FORCE THE GAP STARBUCKS NAME A FEW. THAT ARE VOLUNTARILY DONE THESE TYPES OF AUDITS FOUND THESE DISPARITIES AND THEN MADE CHANGES WITHIN THERE'S THEIR INTERNAL PAY SYSTEMS TO BETTER REPRESENT PEOPLE AT ALL AT ALL LEVELS. AND IN FACT EARLIER THIS YEAR THIRTEEN COMPANIES PLEDGED TOOK THE CALIFORNIA PAY EQUAL PAY PLEDGING COMMITTED TO DOING THIS TYPE OF AUDIT VOLUNTARILY O WE SEE THAT BUSINESSES HAVE. UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS HAVE BY THE AUDIT AND WHAT IT CAN REALLY SHOW THEM ABOUT THEIR OWN COMPANIES AND THEN FINALLY IT GIVES A D. F. E. H. MORE DATA WITH WHICH THEY CAN DO EVALUATIONS ANALYSES OF PAY WITHIN A COMPANY BUT ALSO ACROSS INDUSTRIES. AND IF OVER TIME THEY IDENTIFY A COMPANY WITH SIGNIFICANT PAY DATA -- DISPARITIES OVER TIME THEY CAN CHOOSE TO DO THAT DO AN INVESTIGATION AND SEE WHETHER WARRANTED IF THEY ARE THEN THAT'S GREAT THE COMPANIES ON VIOLATION OF ANY LAWS. AND IF THEY'RE NOT THEN THEY CAN THEN ENFORCE THE LAWS AS THEY ARE REQUIRED TO DO. SO WE THINK THIS PAID REPORTING IS AN EFFICIENT EFFECTIVE TOOL THAT WILL HELP INCREASE -- EFFORTS TO HELP COMBAT THE PAY DISPARITIES THAT WE KNOW EXIST AND FOR THAT REASON WE ARE DRY BOTH AND YOU. THINK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON SHOWS WITH CROWLEY ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA. OF A CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL -- YOU'VE HEARD A LOT OVER THE LAST BIT ABOUT -- FEAR PACE ALL KEEP THROUGH THESE COMMENTS BRIEF BUT I THINK THAT SOME HIGHLIGHTS ARE WE'D SAID UP UNTIL RECENTLY THAT WAS GOING TAKE ABOUT FIFTY YEARS TO CLOSE THE GENDER PAY GAP. BASED ON DATA FROM TWO THOUSAND TO TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN IT'S A HUNDRED AND ONE YEARS NOW. SO NOW ALL THE LAWS THAT WE'VE DONE SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN IN CALIFORNIA HAVE NOT. FULLY TAKEN EFFECT BUT IT GIVES YOU A GOOD IDEA ABOUT. NO MATTER ALL THE GREAT LAWS WE HAVE ON THE BOOKS WE NEED TO DO MORE IN ENFORCEMENT. OUR DATA SHOW THE ONLY ABOUT STUDENT OUT RIGHT BY. OR DISCRIMINATION [inaudible] THE MAJORITY OF THIS IS PERPETUATION OF THE STATUS QUO INCLUDING A JOB SEGREGATION. WOMEN IN ADDITION TO MAKING ON AVERAGE ABOUT 80% OR EIGHTY CENTS ON THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF OF MEN FOR WOMEN OF COLOR IT SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE LEGAL TEAM THIS IS LESS THAN FIFTY CENTS. ON THE ON THE DOLLAR I'M THEY USUALLY GENERALLY NEED EXTRA DEGREES. IF THEY GO TO COLLEGE TO MAKE A SIMILAR SALARIES SO THEN THEY ALSO THIS GETS INTO THE STUDENT LOAN DEBT THAT IS DIFFICULT TO GET OUT OF AND ALSO THINK OF THIS IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF WORKING. WOMEN. THAT ARE USING SOCIAL SAFETY NET PROGRAMS THAT WOULDN'T HAVE TO IF THEY WERE BEING PAID FAIRLY. AND WERE IN. SOME BETTER JOBS. I'M JUST A NOTE ON THE THE THE APPEAL FROM THE NATIONAL WOMEN'S LAW CENTER. TWO THE SUSPENSION OF OF THE EO ONE AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL THAT THE PLAINTIFF LABOR COUNCIL FOR LATIN AMERICAN AND ADVANCEMENT. REPRESENTS TWO MILLION LATINO LATINA TRADE UNIONISTS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES RELY ON THE EO ONE FORM. AND WITH THE USE IT FOR IS THE WORK THEY USE IT TO GO AND WORK WITH EMPLOYERS. SO THERE'S A LOT OF OF KNOWN LITIGATION WAYS THAT YOU CAN GO AND AND YOU KNOW USE THE STATIC AND IT'S NOT GONNA SHOW YOU WHAT THE THE GRANULAR LEVEL -- WE NEED TO HELP EMPLOYERS DO THE RIGHT THING ENCOURAGE THEM TOOK TO LOOK AT THIS BECAUSE IT NEVER NOW THERE'S ALSO ADDITIONALLY TOOLS. THE COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN AND GIRLS HAS PUT OUT IN TERMS OF HERE'S SOME THINGS WE KNOW YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO DISCRIMINATE BUT WE'RE TRYING TO HELP YOU MAKE THINGS RIGHT. WE NEED TO CHANGE THE STATUS QUO WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT IN THIS BILL. THANKYOU BOTH VERY MUCH -- IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. I'M NOT USED TO LABOR COMMITTEE -- SERRA. LABOR FEDERATION IN SUPPORT. JUST PARK WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IN SUPPORT. CAN WEARING ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIANS LIMóN LAWYERS ASSOCIATION PROUD CO SPONSOR AND SUPPORT. KEVIN IN SCOPE FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION CALIFORNIA AND STRONG SUPPORT. RENEE BAYARDO ESSAY YOU CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. PAUL YOU ARE SITTING COUNTY SAN FRANCISCO IN SUPPORT. STEPHANIE IS A WITH THE COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN AND GIRLS IN SUPPORT. DANIEL KEY ACLU CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. JULIA PARISH LEGALLY THAT WORK IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE TAKE A SEAT IN THE SAME RULES UP UP TO SIX MINUTES. DIVVIED UP ANYWAY YOU LIKE YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE ALL THE TIME. THAT'S WHY THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF TRY. TO SENATE BECOME AFTER THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO THE THIS BILL OBVIOUSLY THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE DOES NOT SUPPORT. A DISCRIMINATION -- THE CHAMBERS WERE CLOSELY WITH SENATOR JACKSON AND JENNIFER BYRNE PARTICULAR OF THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS -- INCLUDING I BELIEVE THE CHAMBER SUPPORT SB THREE FIFTY EIGHT THE LANDMARK LEGISLATION SO WE DEFINITELY DO NOT CAN CONDONE PAY DISCRIMINATION. HOWEVER WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL WE'VE TESTIFIED ABOUT SIMILAR BILLS IN THE LAST. FEW YEARS OLD I'LL KEEP OUR COMMENTS BRIEF OUR OVERALL CONCERN IS THAT -- THE REPORTING REQUIREMENT IN THIS BILL CREATES PERHAPS A FALSE IMPRESSION OF WHICH DISCRIMINATION WHEN NINE MAY IN FACT EXIST -- IT RELIES ON JOB TITLES AND JOB CLASSIFICATIONS. NOT ALWAYS DISPARITIES UNLAWFUL THERE ARE LEGITIMATE NON DISCRIMINATORY REASONS FOR PAY DISPARITIES. BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS WITH THE SAME JOB TITLES. EDUCATION EXPERIENCE LEVELS YOU CAN HAVE AN EMPLOYEE WHO'S GOT THIRTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE. WITH THE SAME JOB TITLES IN A PLEA HAS SIX MONTHS OF EXPERIENCE THEY OBVIOUSLY MAY HAVE DIFFERENT PAY -- BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A VIOLATION OF THE LAW BECAUSE THERE'S A LEGITIMATE EXPLANATION FOR THE DIFFERENCE -- AND WE DON'T THINK THESE FACTORS WILL BE SUFFICIENTLY CAPTURED IN THIS PAID OUT AND WE'RE CONCERNED THAT IT CREATES THE FALSE IMPRESSION BUT THERE'S A VIOLATION OF THE LAW AND IF THIS ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. TAKES ACTION ON THAT YES THE EMPLOYER CAN. BUT THAT IS THE TIME AND EXPENSE -- WHEN THERE'S NO VIOLATION OF THE LAW? BUT WE ALSO THINK -- YOU KNOW WE'RE GETTING TO THE TAIL END OF THE THE BACK AND FORTH OVER THE FEDERAL EO ONE THERE WAS. LITIGATION CHALLENGING THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SCALING BACK TO THE E. A ONE WORK REQUIREMENT. IN MARCH THE THE COURT OVERTURNED THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS APPEALED. THAT DECISION -- BUT THE EEOC IS WEBSITE STATES THAT THE NOTICE OF APPEAL DOES NOT POTS THE COURT'S ORDER IN ANY WAY OR IN ANY WAY ALTER THE EO ONE FILERS OBLIGATIONS TO SUBMIT. DATA TO BEGIN IN SEPTEMBER THEY'RE ON TRACK TO BE UP AGAINST COLLECTING PAID OUT OF FOUR CALENDAR YEARS 220-172-2018. SO WE HAVE A COUPLE COMMENTS ON IF THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE SEAMLESS WHAT WITH THE IMPENDING EO ONE REQUIREMENT AND THESE WERE RAISED IN THE SENATE LABOR COMMITTEES ANALYSIS AS WELL. WE THINK THERE SHOULD BE CONSISTENCY AND SO WHILE THE BILL PURPORTS TO PROVIDE AN EMPLOYER CAN SIT SIMPLY SUBMIT THAT FEDERAL EO ONE SATISFIES REQUIREMENTS. WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THE ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE AT THAT SAYS IT HAS TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR. INFORMATION -- MAY BE INTERPRETED TO MEAN THAT THE EO ONE THE FEDERAL YEAR ONE IS NOT ENOUGH THAT YOU HAVE TO SUBMIT SOMETHING MORE. WE'VE ALSO ASKED WE APPRECIATE THE THE AUTHORS WORK TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S NOT A PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST AND THIS INFORMATION IS PROTECTED. THE FEDERAL EO ONE REQUIREMENT HAS SOME ADDITIONAL SANCTIONS AGAINST EMPLOYEES. FROM THE AGENCY WHO LEAKED THIS INFORMATION IN THE SENATE COMMITTEE REYES THESE. TWO AMENDMENTS. AS A SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS THEY WERE NOT TAKEN IN THE SENATE WE THINK AGAIN IF THIS IS GONNA BE CONSISTENT WITH THE FEDERAL EO. ONE THOSE ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS WOULD HELP MAKE SURE THAT THAT THIS IS IN FACT CONSISTENT WITH THAT REQUIREMENT AND SO FOR THESE THOSE REASONS WERE POSTED. THANK YOU JUST TO JUST TO ADD VERY BRIEFLY -- MISTER CHAIR. FIRST ITEM IS THAT THE CENTER JACKSON INDICATED THAT -- EMPLOYERS CARTE CANNOT COMBAT WHAT THEY CAN'T SEE. OBVIOUSLY IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE EO ONE FORM. BUSINESSES HAVE TO COMPILE THAT DATA TO COMPLETE THE FORM SO SUBMITTING THE SAME FORM. A TO THE STATE UNDER THIS MANDATE -- IT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE AND IT'S ALREADY BEEN REYES AND I THINK IS MISS STANDER INDICATED. THE IF YOU WILL PROVERBIAL GOOD ACTORS ACTUALLY BEGAN COMPLYING WITH SENATE BILL THREE FIFTY EIGHT IN THE FALL OF TWENTY FIFTEEN AFTER THE GOVERNOR SIGNED THAT BILL. IN FACT IF YOU SAW MANY STORIES IN THE MERCURY NEWS IN THE CHRONICLE IN THE LA TIMES ABOUT BUSINESSES PUBLICLY TRADED ONES THAT WERE MAKING ANNOUNCEMENTS HOW. IF THEY COULDN'T JUSTIFY ANY PAY DISPARITIES THEY WERE IN FACT -- RAISING THOSE SALARIES WHICH IS OF COURSE IS A REQUIREMENT OF THE LAW RATHER THAN LOWERING. SO THE GOOD ACTORS HAVE BEEN IN COMPLIANCE WITH SB THREE FIFTY EIGHT IN THE AMENDMENTS TO LABOR CODE SECTION ELEVEN NINETY SEVEN POINT. FIVE SO I'M NOT SURE THAT IT IS THE PANACEA BY COMPLETING THIS FORM. THE OTHER THING IS IF YOU IF YOU'VE LOOKED AT THE SHORT E. E. O. ONE FORM. IT HAS CATEGORIES AND THEN IT HAS -- PAY RANGES AND THEN MALE FEMALE -- I'M NOT SURE WHAT SORT OF TREND YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND AND FRANKLY. I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU WOULDN'T IN FACT FIND DESPAIR PAY DISPARITY AND I THINK IN MANY INSTANCES YOU WOULD EXPECT IT. ONE OF THE IMPORTANT PROVISIONS OF SENATE BILL THREE FIFTY EIGHT WAS THE FACT THAT IT INCLUDED. WHAT THE LAW TERMS AS BONTA FIGHTER GOOD FAITH FACTORS IN OTHER WORDS LAWFUL JUSTIFICATIONS FOR THOSE PAY DISPARITIES? NAMELY OF WHICH INCLUDES EDUCATION TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE. AS MR AT BEING. NOTED YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE TWO PEOPLE ONE WITH A COLLEGE DEGREE. AND ONE WITH A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION. OUR SOCIETY VALUES THAT HIGHER EDUCATION AND SO IN MOST INSTANCES WE WOULD EXPECT THE PERSON WITH A BACHELORS DEGREE TO BE PAID MORE SIMILARLY SOMEBODY WHO IS -- YOU KNOW IN THE JOB FOR TEN YEARS VERSUS A FIRST OR SECOND YEAR. NOTHING NONE OF THOSE JUSTIFICATIONS OR THOSE EXPLANATIONS ARE THOSE BONAFIDE FACTORS ARE ENUMERATED IN THOSE IO FORMS HE ONE FORM SO I'M NOT SURE. WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW LEARN FROM THAT RESPECTFULLY AND THE LAST ITEM IS SENATOR JACKSON INDICATED? HEY WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY PROBLEMS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL -- WITH ANY DISCLOSURES WILL THAT IS BECAUSE AT LEAST ONE REASON I BELIEVE IS THAT THE FEDERAL LAWS MISTER I THINK NOTED. REQUIRES ANY VIOLATION TO BE PROSECUTED AS A MISDEMEANOR AND A THOUSAND DOLLAR FINE. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WAS CITED IN THE SENATE POLICY COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND WE WOULD HOPE. THAT THIS COMMITTEE WOULD SEE FIT TO BRING THAT SO THAT THE STATE LEVEL DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME PROBLEMS THAT THE FED OR OR PROBLEMS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES NOT THANK YOU. THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH -- ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON CHIP MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS NICOLE RICE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL WE HAVE BEEN TALKING TO THE AUTHORS OFFICE I WON WITH THE COMMITTEE KNOW THAT. REGULARLY ABOUT SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE PART OF THE PREVIOUS A TESTIMONY. SO UNTIL WE CAN REACH A RESOLUTION ON THAT UNFORTUNATELY WILL HAVE TO REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON KIDDING AND SOME OF THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION WERE HERE IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. HI SEAN LUIS NATIONAL FEDERATION INDEPENDENT BUSINESS REPRESENTING SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ALSO IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MATTHEW ON WESTERN GROWERS ALSO OPPOSED. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT -- ANY COMMENTS. FROM THE COMMITTEE. OR ANY MOTIONS ARE [inaudible] B.. RIGHT SO WE HAVE A MOTION. ON THE TABLE HERE -- IS ANY FURTHER COMMENT ANY COMMENT FOOD MEMBERS. I CENTER THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AGAIN -- I DO THINK THAT THE GOALS ARE A LOT ABOUT I THINK PUTTING THAT MERE UP -- WHEN WE KNOW THESE DISPARITIES EXIST OF ALL OUT AS YOU INDICATED FIRST OF ALL BUT THERE'S A LEGAL ACTION THE COMPANIES CAN TAKE? UP. TO TAKE APPROPRIATE MEASURES -- THEY CAN ALSO IDENTIFY PATTERNS MAYBE THEY DON'T KNOW EXIST THAT MAY NOT BE ILLEGAL BUT ALLOWS THEM TO START TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR AND AND THE THE AND ACTUALLY DO PROACTIVE EFFORTS -- TO MOVE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND SO -- I APPRECIATE -- YOUR THE THE AMENDMENTS ARE TAKEN TO CLEAR DURING THE THE P. R. A. AND I NEED -- FURTHER CONVERSATION THAT THIS WILL IF IT PASSES GO TO JUDICIARY SET UP AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE -- AND THEY'RE WONDERFUL STAFF TO TO ME. BUT FOR ANALYSIS AS TO THE OPTIONS THAT MIGHT BE AVAILABLE -- AND OTHERWISE OF OF SUPPORTER PREVIOUS EFFORTS I KNOW THAT THE EFFORTS THAT. SUMMER GONZALEZ AFFORD I PROPOSE FOR THAT AS PER YOUR PREVIOUS EFFORTS WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO SO -- WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. VERY BRIEFLY -- THE NOTION THAT WERE THAT WERE GONNA SEE LAWSUITS BECAUSE SOMEONE'S PAID MORE THAN SOMEBODY ELSE. THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT THAT'S THE FAIR PAY ACT AND WILL YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY SHE THAT IMPLEMENTED AND HOPEFULLY SHE COMPANIES COMPLY WITHOUT THE NEED FOR LITIGATION. THIS IS TO LOOK AT THE LARGER LEVEL ARE THERE PATTERNS OR IS THEIR JOB SEGREGATION IF WE SEE TWENTY MEN GETTING PAID HIGHER SALARIES AND TWO WOMEN IN THAT SAME CATEGORY. IT MIGHT BEG THE QUESTION ARE AT LEAST TWENTY MEN ARE THEY BETTER EDUCATED DID THEY HAVE MORE EXPERIENCE AND THOSE ARE ALL DEFENSES IF THAT'S THE CASE. I WOULD SUGGEST AND SUBMIT THAT THE PROBLEM IS ONE OF INSTITUTIONALIZED DISCRIMINATION AND AS WAS POINTED OUT. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I CAN'T WAIT A HUNDRED AND ONE YEARS FOR US TO GET A QUALITY I CAN'T EVEN WAIT TILL -- TWENTY FIFTY AND NEITHER SHOULD ANY THE REST OF US WE HAVE PATTERNS OF INSTITUTIONALIZED DISCRIMINATION WHETHER INTENTIONAL OR NOT. THIS BILL IS ONE OF THE TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN -- OF BLOW THROUGH THAT -- CEILING WHETHER IT'S RACIALLY OR GENDER BASED OR ETHNICALLY BASED SO THAT PEOPLE ARE PAID AND JUDGED ON THE QUALITY OF THEIR WORK AND NOT ON THEIR GENDER NOT ON THE RACE. NOT ON THEIR ETHNICITY AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO HELP US DOING WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU CENTER -- WE DO HAVE A MOTION MISS SUMMER GONZALEZ ACNE BY SUMMER REVERSE ABOUT A CENTURY OF CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. MOTION IS TO PASS TO JUDICIARY KALRA AYE KALRA AYE FLORA. FLORA NO CARILLO. YEP. YEP NO GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I JONES SAWYER THREE OF US. THREE OF US HI. ON CALL. SO A SOVIET WILL KEEP THE BILL ON COLONIES WERE MORE VOTE AND WE DO HAVE A COUPLE OTHER MEMBERS OTHER COMMITTEES AND SO -- WILL WAIT FOR THEM. TO GIVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU. SET ASIDE A WINNER. THIS IS THE SB. ONE FORTY TWO WHENEVER YOU'RE READY -- OF THE CO PRESENTING TIME IS INTERNET OKAY. YOUR BRING IN THE LINES A LITTLE ON THE MAN TALK ABOUT BREAST FEEDING ON HIS OWN. AS A BENEFICIARY OF BREASTFEEDING I LITTLE INNER AND OUTER AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER PLEASE CONTINUE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US -- ON THE BILL AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENT THAT CLARIFIES THAT ARE ON D<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt;</u> HARDSHIP EXEMPTION -- WILL BE EXACTLY THE SAME AS WELL AS FEDERAL LAW SO WERE CONSISTENT WITH FEDERAL LAW. I'M SB ONE FORTY TWO INSURERS -- AN EASY TRANSITION FOR NEW MOTHERS -- BACK TO WORK AND MOVES US AWAY FROM FORCING NEW MOTHERS -- TO CHOOSE BETWEEN RETURNING TO WORK -- AND BREAST FEEDING -- THEIR CHILD. WE WANT -- WOMEN'S DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES WHEN THEY RETURN TO WORK -- AND NOT BE FORCED TO DELAY -- IF THEY ARE ARE BREASTFEEDING AND CONVERSELY WE WANT WOMEN TO CHOOSE HOW LONG THEY'VE BREAST FEED -- AND RETURNING TO WORK SHOULD NOT BE A BARRIER TO BREAST FEEDING. ODD THERE ARE STILL TOO MANY WOMEN IN THE WORKFORCE WHO -- DO NOT HAVE ACCESS -- TO DESCEND AND PRIVATE AND CLEAN -- SPACE -- TO EXPRESS OF BREAST MILK. AND AND TO BE ABLE TO WORK AT THE SAME TIME -- AND SO THIS OF LEGISLATION WILL SET SOME BASIC STANDARDS WE KNOW THE CURRENT LAW IS THAT YOU CAN'T FORCE WOMEN TO EXPRESS MILK IN A RESTAURANT THAT IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. BASELINE STANDARD BUT WE NEED TO GO ABOVE AND BEYOND THAT AND WE HEAR TOO MANY STORIES OF WOMEN -- EXPRESSING MILK AND IN A BROOM CLOSET OR OTHER UNACCEPTABLE SPACE -- SO THE BILL WILL I REQUIRE THAT -- EMPLOYER -- PROVIDE A PRIVATE SPACE WITH A TABLE A CHAIR -- AN ELECTRIC OUTLET. AND NEARBY ARE REFRIGERATION AND RUNNING WATER HI THIS IS NOT SOME EXTRAORDINARY -- IMPOSITION ON AN EMPLOYER -- IT IS PRETTY BASIC IN ADDITION -- THE BILL PROVIDES SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY TO EMPLOYERS IF AN EMPLOYER THAT THAT DOESN'T HAVE WALLS FOR PRIVATE ROOMS -- THEY CAN HAVE TEMPORARY SPACES THAT DAY I SET UP IN ADDITION IF YOU HAVE A MULTI TENANT COMMERCIAL SITUATION THEY CAN -- HAVE SHARED SPACE AND WE DO HAVE THE ON UNDO HARDSHIP -- PROVISION -- THAT -- CAN BE -- CLAIM BY -- BUSINESSES WITH FEWER THAN. FIFTY EMPLOYEES HI THIS BILL HAS GONE THROUGH AN EVOLUTION WE HAVE WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY FOR THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF -- AND A MADE AMENDMENTS TO TRY TO ENSURE FLEXIBILITY AND FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IN THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY -- AND WE CONTINUE TO HAVE A AN OPEN DOOR -- SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AIBO AND I'LL TURN IT OVER TO OUR LEGISLATIVE PARTNER -- SOME MEMBER GONZALEZ THANK YOU SENATOR SAM THANK YOU AND I THINK THE SENATOR DID A VERY GOOD JOB OF EXPLAINING THE BILL EXPLAINING I THINK THE AT THE IMMENSE AMOUNT OF COMPROMISE THAT HAS BEEN PUT INTO THIS BILL TO MAKE IT WORKABLE FOR EMPLOYERS -- IN IN TO A POINT WHERE -- UNLESS WE'RE STILL LEAVING A LOT OF WOMEN AND PROTECTED BUT SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO MAKE INCREMENTAL CHANGE -- THIS IS AN IMPORTANT FEATURE BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE TIME PERIOD WE ALLOW OR EVEN COURAGE WOMEN TO TAKE OFF WORK -- AFTER HAVING A BABY DOESNOT MATCH UP WITH THE TIME PERIOD THAT ANY DOCTOR WILL TELL YOU IS HOW LONG YOU SHOULD BE BREAST FEEDING -- ARE PROVIDING YOUR YOUR CHILD WITH BREAST MILK IF POSSIBLE AND SO IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE DOING ON THE HEALTHIEST AT AND AND MOST BENEFICIAL THING FOR CHILDREN. WE HAVE TO PROVIDE A SITUATION BY WHICH A WOMAN CAN RETURN TO WORK ON HER TIMELINE AND STILL PROVIDE BREASTMILK -- I HAPPEN TO HAVE. HAD SOME OF THOSE EXPERIENCES RETURNING TO SCHOOL AND THEN LATER TO WORK ON ON DIFFERENT CHILDREN -- WHILE I WAS STILL BREAST FEEDING AND I'M HAVING. BREAST FED IN BATHROOMS -- CLOSETS AT AT MY DESK WHERE ANYONE CAN WALK AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT I IT IS YOU KNOW IT TAKES A LOT IN THIS IS PROBABLY. NOT FAIR TO SAY THE LEAST TO TO ASK WOMEN -- TO DO THAT IN I LITERALLY BROUGHT MY BABY AND DEPRESSED FEET I WASN'T PUMPING -- PUMPING AS OF A FIRE -- MORE INTENSE SITUATION A MOST MOST WORKERS MUST WOMEN CAN'T JUST BRING THEIR CHILD INTO BREAST FEED OUT WORK AND SO -- PUMPING IS THE ONLY POSSIBILITY -- THAT SHE HOUSE AND SO TO DO THAT YOU NEED PRIVACY YOU NEED AN OUTLET YOU NEED. A DESK OR A TABLE AND A CHAIR -- AND THOSE IN SOME PRIVACY AND AND THAT'S NOT TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR OF COURSE WE DON'T WANT THAT BREAST MILK TO GO BAD SO REFRIGERATION AS WELL. SO I THINK THIS IS COMMON SENSE I THINK IT'S VERY LIMITED NOW IN ITS APPLICATION AND IS ONE STEP FORWARD TO ENSURE THAT WERE ACTUALLY ACCOMMODATING WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY BOAT. THANK YOU OF THE END WITH THE SAYS MONEY UP TO SIX MINUTES YOU CAN DIVIDE IT UP AND YOU WAY YOU'D LIKE. THANK YOU CHUCK CHAIR KALRA MEMBERS THE CALIFORNIA BREASTFEEDING COALITION COALITION IS PLEASED TO BE A CO SPONSOR OF SB. ONE FOUR TWO AND WE WORK TO PROMOTE PROTECT AND SUPPORT BREASTFEEDING BECAUSE BREAST MILK PROVIDES OPTIMAL NUTRITION THAT BABIES NEED AND DESERVE. AND BREAST FEEDING IMPACTS MOTHERS LONG TERM HEALTH DECREASING HER RISK FOR TYPE TWO DIABETES. OVARIAN AND BREAST CANCERS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND HIGH CHOLESTEROL AND THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT CALIFORNIA WOMEN. WANT TO BREASTFEED 94% OF MOTHER START OFF BREAST FEEDING IN THE HOSPITAL BUT AT THREE MONTHS POSTPARTUM ONLY 29%. ARE FEEDING ONLY BREAST MILK TO THEIR BABIES DESPITE THE URGING OF ALL MAJOR MEDICAL AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION'S THAT INFANTS ONLY BE FED BREASTMILK FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF LIFE AN AT LEAST UP TO YEAR. AS COMPLEMENTARY FOODS ARE INTRODUCED. A MAJOR REASON FOR THIS DRAMATIC DECLINE IN BREAST FEEDING AT THREE MONTHS POSTPARTUM IS BECAUSE MOTHERS RETURNED TO WORK TO ON SUPPORT OF WORKPLACES. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FOUND THAT MOTHERS. HAVE -- THAT MOTHERS HAVE WITH LOWER HOUSEHOLD INCOMES. OR IF THEY'RE BLACK OR HISPANIC ENTER THEIR PRIMARY LANGUAGE IS NOT ENGLISH ARE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE. IN A LESS LIKELY TO HAVE A SUPPORT OF WORKPLACE TO EXPRESS MILK. THE PROVISIONS IN SB ONE FORTY TWO ARE CRITICAL TO IMPROVING. BREASTFEEDING SUPPORT FOR MOTHERS IN THE WORKPLACE EXPRESSLY IN THIS TIME WHEN MOTHERS WITH YOUNG CHILDREN ARE THE FASTEST GROWING WORK FORCE IN THE U. S.. IN THE WORKPLACE GREATLY IMPACTS MOTHER'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE BREASTFEEDING IMPRESS READING IS AN IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE AND IT'S GOOD FOR BUSINESS. WHEN EMPLOYERS SUPPORT THEIR BREASTS BEING EMPLOYEES THAT SUPPORT IMPROVES PRODUCTIVITY BILLS EMPLOYEE MORALE INCREASES EMPLOYEES LLOYD'S LOYALTY WHICH HELPS RECRUIT AND RETAIN EMPLOYEES? IT ALSO DECREASES HEALTHCARE COSTS IN ABSENTEEISM DUE TO ILLNESS AND FOR THESE REASONS I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU YOU -- JULIE PARRISH I'M A LAWYER AT LEGALLY THAT WORK WHICH IS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT ADVOCATES ON BEHALF OF LOW WAGE WORKERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- ARE WORKING FAMILY PROGRAM HERE'S FROM THOUSANDS OF PARENTS A YEAR STRUGGLING WITH THESE VERY ISSUES AND I JUST WANT TO BRIEFLY UNDERSCORE THAT. NEW MOTHERS ARE THE FASTEST GROWING SEGMENT OF THE WORK FORCE WE KNOW THAT MANY OF THEM EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO CONTINUE TO GET THEIR BABIES BREAST MILK WE KNOW THAT AFTER THEY WERE DEFERRED TO WORK. THEY CAN'T DO THAT -- AND OVER A THIRD REPORT THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE WORKPLACE SUPPORTS NECESSARY SO THIS IS A CLEAR PROBLEM THE THE HEALTH THE EVIDENCE IS OVERWHELMING THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT INTERVENTION WE HAVE. AND I CAN'T UNDERSCORE NOT HELD BASIC THESE PROVISIONS WERE TALKING ABOUT OUR IT'S A CHAIR AND A TABLE AND UP POLICIES SO THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND. THAT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO EVEN ASK FOR THE ABILITY TO DO THAT -- FOR A LOT OF THE LOW WAGE WORKERS THAT WE SPEAK WITH APPROACHING A SUPERVISOR TO ASK FOR LACTATION ACCOMMODATIONS IS A HUGE BARRIER AND FRANKLY ONE OF THE THE GREATEST INNOVATIONS OF THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION IS THAT IT REQUIRES A POLICY THAT'S TRANSLATED. THAT'S DISTRIBUTED EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE PART OF THEIR WORKPLACE RIGHTS PART OF WHAT A TRANSITION BACK TO WORK LOOKS LIKE AND IT GIVES EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES THE OPPORTUNITY TO FIND A REALLY COMMONSENSE SOLUTION TO WHATEVER -- CHALLENGES MAY BE PRESENT IN THEIR PARTICULAR WORK FORCE OR SITUATION -- THIS IS THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL THING THAT A PARENT CAN DO FOR A CHILD IS YOU KNOW PROVIDE THEM FOOD IT'S WHAT KEEPS BABIES ALIVE -- AND IF WE DON'T MAKE THESE MOST BASIC IMPORTANT. AND SIMPLE CHANGES TO WORKPLACE REQUIREMENTS WE ARE GOING TO EITHER EXCLUDE WOMEN AND NEW MOTHERS FROM THE WORK FORCE OR FORCE THEM. TO STOP BREAST FEEDING THEIR BABIES BEFORE THEY'RE READY TO DO SO AND NO ONE'S EMPLOYER SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT DECISION FOR THEM. THANK YOU. OF ANYONE ELSE'S SUPPORT.

JUST BIRTH LOW ESTRIN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AND A MOM WHO BREAST FED AT WORK. IT'S WHAT THANK YOU. CAITLYN VEGA FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO HERE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THE ONE HERE IN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THAT HAVE BECOME HAVE TO THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE -- AND AS A MYTH MAIL OPPOSING THIS BILL IN FULL. WITH A LOT OF KIDS IT GIVES ALL THIS IS WITH A LOT OF AND IF IT I DO FOR THE RECORD. I'M A FATHER OF SEVEN CHILDREN ALL OF ALL OF WHOM WERE EXCLUSIVELY BREASTFED FOR LONGER THAN TWELVE MONTHS SO I'M A BIG FAN OF FEEDING AND THEY SHOULD HAVE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IS NOT OPPOSED TO LACKS LACTATION ACCOMMODATION WE WORK CLOSELY WITH. ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVEL LAST YEAR ON HER AB NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX IT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW BUT WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ARE SOME OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS BILL. WHICH WE DO THINK WE'LL BE BURDENSOME FORMER EMPLOYERS AND LEAD TO INCREASED LITIGATION. WE APPRECIATE AUTHORS -- EFFORTS ON THIS BILL IS DIALOGUE LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR AND MAINTENANCE THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN THUS FAR BUT WE DO HAVE REMAINING CONCERNS AND I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF THOSE. NUMBER ONE THE BUILDING CODE REQUIREMENTS I'M SO WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE NEW BUILDING CODE REQUIREMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS BILL. AND ALL ALTHOUGH THE AUTHOR ELIMINATED THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS THE BILL NOW SAYS THE SAN FRANCISCO ORDINANCE IS THE STARTING POINT WHICH WE THINK IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME -- AND BASED ON THE EXPERIENCE IN SAN FRANCISCO EMPLOYERS -- COSTS FOR THOSE BUILDING CODE REQUIREMENTS HAVE BEEN BETWEEN THIRTY AND A HUNDRED AND FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. WELL IN THE TWO YEARS SINCE AT ORDINANCES BEEN. IN EFFECT -- WE WOULD KNOW GOVERNOR BROWN VETOED SB NINE THIRTY SEVEN LAST YEAR WHICH DID NOT CONTAIN THE BUILDING CODE REQUIREMENTS SO WE'VE ASKED FOR THE BUILDING CODE PROVISIONS TO BE DELETED FROM THIS BILL. WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED THAT THIS BILL DUPLICATES -- LIABILITY FOR RETALIATION THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT ALREADY REGULATES DISCRIMINATION RETALIATION ISSUES INVOLVING. A LACTATION ACCOMMODATION IN THE FIFA REMEDIES INCLUDE COMPENSATORY DAMAGES INJUNCTIVE RELIEF PUNITIVE DAMAGES ATTORNEY'S FEES SO WE DON'T REALLY SEE THE NEED TO INCORPORATE. RETALIATION AND DISCRIMINATION PROVISIONS INTO THE LABOR CODE. ANYTIME YOU HAVE TWO DIFFERENT CODES IN TWO DIFFERENT AGENCIES -- ENFORCING IN INTERPRETING OVERLAPPING PROVISIONS OF THE LAW WE THINK THAT CAN LEAD TO CONFUSION -- AN INCONSISTENT ENFORCEMENT AND AGAIN WE DO HAVE INCREASED THE CONCERNS ABOUT INCREASED LITIGATION COSTS PRIMARILY BECAUSE THESE PRESCRIPTIVE AND DETAILED REQUIREMENTS ARE IN THE LABOR CODE AND WE DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR TAKING OUT THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. BUT IT'S THE LABOR CODE IT'S STILL SUBJECT TO PAGA FOR ANY VIOLATION PARK HAS NO HARM REQUIREMENT YOU CAN BE A MINOR TECHNICAL VIOLATION OF ANY THESE APARTMENTS AND IT'S SUBJECT TO A POPULAR VACATION. SO WE DO HAVE CONCERNS THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE INCREASED LITIGATION HERE. AND THE LAST POINT I WANTED TO RAISE IS WITH RESPECT TO THE PROVISION THAT ADDS THE LACTATION BREAKS TO LABOR CODE SECTION TWO TO SIX POINT. SEVEN WHICH IS THE REMEDY OF ONE HOUR PAY FOR NOT PROVIDING MEAL AND REST PERIODS TWO EMPLOYEES AND SO MEAL RECIPES ARE -- EASIER FOR AN EMPLOYEE TO IMPLEMENT AND POLICE SAID MONITOR BECAUSE THEY'RE BASED ON VERY FINITE REQUIREMENTS IN THE LAW THE MEAL PERIOD HAS TO BE PROVIDED BEFORE THE END OF THE FIFTH HOUR OF WORK. REST PERIODS HAVE TO BE PROVIDED EVERY FOUR HOURS IN THE MIDDLE OF THOSE FOR OUR CHEFS. LACTATION THE COMBINATION BREAKS BY NATURE ARE MORE SUBJECTIVE EVERY EMPLOYEE IS GONNA BE DIFFERENT EVERYBODY EMPLOYEES CAN HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS MORE FREQUENCY OF BREAKS. SO FOR THAT REASON THAT IT'S MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE EMPLOYER TO MONITOR AND POLICE THAT THE EMPLOYEE IS TAKING THOSE BREAKS AT THE GIVEN TIME THAT THEY NEED. AND SO WE'RE CONCERNED THAT IMPOSING THE HARSH PENALTY OF LABOR CO TWO TO SIX POINT SEVEN DOESN'T MESH WITH. THAT SUBJECTIVE NATURE OF THESE TYPE OF BREAKS AND SO WE'VE ASKED THAT THE PROVISIONS ADDING. LACTATION BREAKS THE LABOR CODE SECTION TWO TO SIX POINT SEVEN BE DELETED FROM THE BILL -- SO WE'VE SUBMITTED PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO AUTHORS OFFICE ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE STAFF BUT FOR THESE REASONS WERE OPPOSED TO THE BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU. THE CALL RISE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURES AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION WE TOO ARE ALSO POSE FOR THE REASONS THAT WERE OUTLINED TO BY THE CHAMBER BUT ALSO FOR A PARTICULAR REASON RELATED TO MANUFACTURING. SO WE UNDERSTAND -- EAT THE NEED TO TRY. TO CONFORME THIS BILL -- TO THE FEDERAL LAW RELATED TO THE UNDUE HARDSHIP AND WHILE WE DIDN'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL RELATED TO THAT PROVISION. WE THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THAT RELATED TO MANUFACTURING IT'S NOT REALLY BASS THE HARDSHIP IS NOT REALLY BASED ON THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES BUT REALLY ON THE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE INDUSTRIAL FACILITY. SO IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU HAVE FIVE EMPLOYEES IN THAT FACILITY OR YOU HAVE A HUNDRED EMPLOYEES IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A PLACE OTHER THAN THE BATHROOM THAT IS CLOSED OFF FOR PRIVACY. FOR SAFETY FOR MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT EXPOSED TO THE OUTPUT OF THE MANUFACTURING PRACTICE THEN YOU CANNOT PROVIDE. ACCORDING TO THE THE PROVISIONS IN THE BILL AND YOU WOULD NEED TO PROVIDE THAT SPACE THAT PROVIDES THAT PRIVACY AND SECURITY AND AND ELIMINATION FOR EXPOSE OR TWO THAT THOSE BY PRODUCTS. EVEN A TEMPORARY STRUCTURE MAY NOT WORK IF YOU EVER SEEN THESE INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES THEY COULD BE FILLED THE WHOLE FACILITY COULD BE FILLED WITH INDUSTRIAL EQUIPMENT AND THERE JUST ISN'T A PLACE TO PUT A TEMPORARY. STRUCTURE SO THAT'S WHY WE WERE HAPPY TO WORK WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER Là M<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; LAST YEAR AND&lt;/c&gt;</u> WORK ON A HARDSHIP EXEMPTION THAT TOOK INTO THE CONSIDERATION. THE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE FACILITY IN ADDITION TO THAT TO ADDRESS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS CONCERNED THAT ALL EMPLOYERS COULD NOW SELL CERTIFY IF YOU WILL THAT THEY HAD A HARDSHIP AND THEREFORE COULD. COME UNDER THIS EXEMPTION SHE PUT LANGUAGE IN THERE SO THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO BASICALLY CERTIFIED TO THE DEPARTMENT THAT THE HARDSHIP EXISTED SO WAS A LITTLE YOU KNOW SOMETHING ON THE BACK IN TO MAKE SURE. THAT EMPLOYERS JUST WEREN'T CLAIMING OUT WHEN IT WASN'T POSSIBLE WE THINK THAT PROVIDES -- ADDRESSES THE CONCERNS OF THAT ARTHUR BUT ALSO PARTICULARLY THE CONCERNS OF THIS COMMITTEE RELATED TO THAT HARDSHIP EXEMPTION SO WHAT WE'RE REALLY ASKING IS FOR THE HARDSHIP EXEMPTION TO MIRROR WHAT'S IN CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE IF THIS BILL DID BE COME LAW IT WOULD PROVIDE MORE PROTECTIONS TO EMPLOYEES AND BY DOING THAT THE CALIFORNIA LAW WOULD GOVERN. AND SO NOW WHAT EMPLOYERS ARE CURRENTLY LOOKING AT A CALIFORNIA LAW RELATED TO THAT HARDSHIP EXEMPTION WOULD BE ROLLED BACK AND FROM THE MANUFACTURER'S PERSPECTIVE THAT BE ROLLING BACK THE FAX ABILITY THAT WE NEED. FOR OUR FACILITIES WHEN THEY CANNOT ACCOMMODATE THE INCLUSION OF A PERMANENT OR TEMPORARY LACTATION SPACE SO FOR THOSE REASONS AND THE REASONS PREVIOUS STATED WE ARE POST THANK YOU THANK YOU. I'M AT THE ANY OF THE TIMES UP FOR COMMENTARY BUT OR FROM -- FOR WITNESSES BUT WE ARE. HAPPY TO OPEN UP TO ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION NAME TITLE AND THE POSITION MATTHEW HARPER THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS PROPERTIES ASSOCIATION I WAS GOING TO WELL YOU WITH BUILDING CODE TALK.

BEING ABLE TO TO BREAST FEED YOU CAN ALSO ME UNDERSTAND HOW DIFFICULT EVEN THAT WOULD BE -- I'M SURE WE COULD MEET THIS THRESHOLD WHICH I THINK IS THAT MUCH LOWER -- I'M A DIFFICULT DIFFICULTY LEVEL. CONCERNED ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY THERE'S A WHOLE LOT AND AND FOR THOSE REASONS I I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN STILL BE AT IS A CO AUTHOR I. SHOULD. RECALL THROUGH ON ALL OF THESE PRESS MEETING BILLS -- BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS AN ESSENTIAL. PART OF WHO WE SHOULD BE. AS AS A COMMUNITY. THANK YOU RAPID IDEA. THE END RESULT IN MOTION. SOME OF THE SECOND. WAY IS THE SECOND. THANK YOU -- THE OTHER COMMENT. AND IF NOT -- I'D ALSO I THOUGHT. I'D LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR I'M NOT AT THIS POINT I I KNOW THAT -- WE SEE THE WORLD WE SEE THE THE WAY THAT WE SEE IT AND SOMETIMES AS MEN WE DON'T NECESSARILY SEE THE CHALLENGE THAT WOMEN -- THAT'S A FACE AND A ONE THOUSAND SOUNDS A CITY COUNCIL -- THERE WAS. A MEETING THAT WE HAD AND AFTER THE MEETING A WOMAN ASKED WHERE CAN I GO TO PUMP.

TO JUMPSTART A CRITICAL CONVERSATION IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT -- WHAT TAKEN AN EQUITY STAKE IN FUTURE OUTCOMES -- COULD LOOK LIKE WHEN YOU HAVE GOOGLE PUTTING FORTH A BILLION DOLLARS IN THE HOUSING IN SAN JOSE -- THAN SAN JOSE RESPONDING -- BY TALKING ABOUT LABOR STANDARDS I THINK THAT'S THAT'S A HEALTHY KIND OF EVOLUTION -- WHERE WE SEE BOTH FOLKS WHO ARE -- DRIVING THE ECONOMY BUT ALSO POTENTIALLY DISPLACING WORKERS ARE IMPACTING HOUSING PRICES HOW TODAY'S OR TO COME TO THE TABLE AND EQUITABLE WAY I WHEN YOU LOOK AT IMPACTS ON DEMOCRACY FOR INSTANCE AND YOU KNOW. FACEBOOK IS A IS A SERIOUS THREAT TO OUR DEMOCRACY IN SOME REGARDS AND YET WE ALL USE FACEBOOK TO REACH OUR CONSTITUENTS AND FIND WAYS TO GET THE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITIES ACTUALLY GET OUR MESSAGE OUT SO. WRESTLING WITH THOSE ISSUES IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO GET AHEAD OF AND FOR THAT REASON I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND I DO APPRECIATE -- MY CO AUTHOR HERE FROM DOWN SOUTH. WHO JUST GIVE ME A THUMBS UP? THANK YOU CENTER IS A MEMBER. I THINK IF AS WE ARE TECHNOLOGIES CHANGING SO MUCH OF WHAT WE DO AND HOW WE DO IT. I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE AS A STATE. DON'T JUST LET THE SIGNAL OUT TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES HAPPEN -- BUT THAT WE ARE PLENTIFUL AND THOUGHTFUL. ABOUT AND DESPAIR TECHNOLOGY FUTURE AND I THINK THAT'S THE THE GOAL OF THIS BILL AND NAY. I COMMISSION ON TECH EQUITY WILL ENSURE THAT. AS WE TAKE ADVANTAGES OF TECHNOLOGY THAT. NO ONE IN CALIFORNIA GETS LEFT BEHIND. THANK YOU. OF ANYONE ELSE'S SUPPORT. DO WE HAVE ANY OPPOSITION. WE HAVE A MOTION ANY FURTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. UP SENATOR AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANK YOU SO MUCH BRING THIS FOR I DO THINK IN MANY WAYS THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN FORCED UPON US IT'S UP TO US TO DECIDE HOW TO RESPOND AND SO -- I THINK THIS IS A DEFINITELY A POSITIVE STEP.

QUESTION IS DO PASSED TO PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTIONS COMMITTEE KALRA AYE KALRA AYE FLORA. FLORA I CARILLO YEP. HI GONZALEZ. GONZALEZ I JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER AYE [inaudible] THREE OF US. THREE OF US. ALL RIGHT THE BILL IS OUT. MY BODY GUARD. I DON'T KNOW I I AM -- SET SENATOR CABALLERO RUNNING IS SOLO -- IS A SOLO. WELL I SOME SAY THEY KNOW EXACTLY. THESE THESE GUYS NEED ALL THE HELP THEY CAN GET I GUESS -- CENTER AND CABALLERO -- WE HAVE SB TWENTY FIVE AND YOU MAY PROCEED WHENEVER AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR -- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT SB TWENTY FIVE WHICH CREATES AN INCENTIVE FOR GREEN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT FOR CRITICAL HOUSING STATEWIDE. AND FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN CALIFORNIA'S OPPORTUNITY ZONES -- THOSE OF YOU THAT THANK YOU THOSE OF YOU WHO KNOW ME AND MY BACKGROUND UNDERSTAND SB. TWENTY FIVE I STARTED OFF WORKING AS AN ATTORNEY REPRESENTING WORKING FAMILIES IN THE SALINAS VALLEY IN PARTICULAR FARMWORKERS AND FOR THE PAST THIRTY YEARS -- I'VE WORKED AS AN A SELECTED LOCAL FOCUSING ON CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR SUCCESS FOR THOSE THAT ARE SYSTEMATICALLY PRECLUDED FROM THOSE OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE OF POVERTY -- I HAVE WORKED TO BUILD RESILIENCY AND ARE POOREST COMMUNITIES BY CHANGING THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH PEOPLE LIVE WORK AND PLAY. SO FOR AS ELECTED OFFICIALS I KNOW THAT YOU HERE REGULARLY FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS ABOUT PERVASIVE POVERTY AND HARDSHIP IN OUR COMMUNITIES. POVERTY THAT RESULTS FROM THE LACK OF GOOD PAYING JOBS. POVERTY THAT TAKES AWAY AMBITION AND HOPE AND POVERTY THAT LEADS TO RESIGNATION THAT THINGS HAVE NO CHANCE TO IMPROVE. SB TWENTY FIVE IS A MODEST ATTEMPT TO JOIN FORCES WITH THE FEDERAL TAX CREDIT DESIGNED TO FUNNEL AN ESTIMATED SIX TRILLION DOLLARS. FROM CAPITAL GAINS EARNINGS INTO AMERICA'S POOREST NEIGHBORHOODS SB TWENTY FIVE ATTACKS POVERTY IN THE EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE DESIGNATED OPPORTUNITIES OWNS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. BY CREATING MARKET CONDITIONS FOR PRIVATE INVESTMENT CAPITAL TO REACH COMMUNITIES MOST IMPACTED BY CHRONIC POVERTY. IT SETS THE HIGHEST ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS FOR QUALITY PROJECTS AND CUT IN CALIFORNIA REQUIRING THAT ALL CONSTRUCTION BEACON SYSTEM WITH LOCAL GENERAL PLANT ZONING CODES. AND REQUIRES LED L. E. D. LEAD CERTAIN GOLD CERTIFICATION ZERO NET EMISSIONS AND ZERO NET GHG. IT PROTECTS COMMUNITY GENTRIFICATION AND DISPLACEMENT BY REQUIRING A UP TO SEVENTY PART 5% OF THE TOTAL SQUARE FOOTAGE IN MIXED USE. BE DEDICATED TO HOUSING WITH A MINIMUM OF 40% OF THE UNITS BEING AFFORDABLE WITH A THIRTY YEAR AFFORDABILITY REQUIREMENTS. IT REQUIRES SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKERS FOR ALL HOUSING PROJECTS GREATER THAN TWENTY FIVE UNITS AND CREATES NEW WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT IN GREEN BUILDING TRADES. WHICH IS A SKILL SET THAT THE STATE DESPERATELY NEEDS. REQUIRES PREVAILING WAGES FOR PROJECTS ABOVE TWENTY FIVE UNITS AND IT REQUIRES THAT ALL PROJECTS GO THROUGH THE EXACT DECISIONS REGARDING SEEK BUT THAT SET FOR TO FOURTH TODAY. SO IT IS NOT A SEQUEL EXCEPTION AND I REPEAT THAT IT'S NOT AN EXEMPTION. IT DOES ONE THING ONLY IT GIVES PROJECTS AN OPPORTUNITY ZONES AND HOUSING PROJECTS FINANCED WITH TAX PAYERS MONEY. CERTAINTY THAT THE PROJECT FUNDS AND THE PROJECT WILL NOT BE UNDULY BURDENED BY NAME BE LITIGATION. IT DOES THIS BY SIMPLY REQUIRING THE COURTS TO SEEK TO REACH A FINAL DISPOSITION WITHIN TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DAYS. IF FEASIBLE THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S THE OFFRAMP -- IT WILL DISCOURAGE FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS pTHEY ARE CHALLENGING PROJECTS THAT ARE HAVE ALREADY MET AN INCREDIBLY HIGH PUBLIC INTEREST STANDARD AND THAT THE SUITS WILL BE RISK RESOLVED IN A TIMELY MANNER. AND THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHICH CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IN THE INVESTMENT IN IN -- IN THESE PROJECTS -- IT CREATES A MULTIPLIER EFFECT WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLANS FOR THE OPPORTUNITIES ON THE ADMINISTRATION IS ALREADY MADE -- DISCUSSED THAT AND THEY'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT -- MAKING THE AYE BACK. SPUR OPPORTUNITIES OWN INVESTMENT -- DEVELOPMENT AND THEY WANT TO CREATE JOB OPPORTUNITIES IN THE OPPORTUNITIES OWNED IN ADDITION TO HOUSING. SO IT AMPLIFIES THE ADMINISTRATION'S INTEREST IN OPPORTUNITY SOUNDS. SO -- I'LL THAT THIS BILL IS COMMITTED TO TACKLING TACTIC DECADES OF INSUFFERABLE POVERTY FOR THE EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE CENSUS TRACKS THAT ARE CALIFORNIA'S POOREST. HOUSING AND JOB FOR COMMUNITIES AND IT DOES THIS BE FOR THAT. THAT FEDERAL BILL SUNSET WELL THIS HAS A FIVE YEAR SUNSET IT THAT MATCHES THE SUNSET THAT. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS HAS SET SO. PART OF THE KEY HERE IS MATCHING UP THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS MADE AVAILABLE FOR PRIVATE FUNDS WITH OUR OWN -- WITH OUR OWN EXPEDITED LITIGATION PROCESS SO WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT YOU HVE UP TO SIX MINUTES TO BUY IT ANYWAY YOU'D LIKE. HI FOR ME WITH WHITE HOUSE PUBLIC AFFAIRS ON BEHALF A HABITAT FOR HUMANITY CALIFORNIA THAT SPONSOR THE BELL. AND AT SEQUENT DEFINITELY WERE SUPPORT OF A C. QUIET AND IT HAS A VERY IMPORTANT TOOL TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT HOWEVER IT HAS BECOME A TOOL THAT IS BEEN USED AND ABUSED TO DISCOURAGE AND DELAY HOUSING PRODUCTION THROUGHOUT THE CITY CALIFORNIA AN EXAMPLE IN REDWOOD CITY. WITH A TWENTY UNIT PROJECT I'M FOR HABITAT HOMEOWNER SERVING WERE TO ACTUALLY DELAYED FOR SIXTEEN MONTHS TO THE LITIGATION FORTUNATELY THE PROJECT WAS ABLE TO GO FORWARD AND LIKE SEVERAL OTHER PROJECTS IN THE REGION THAT WERE DELAYED AND THREATENED BY THE SAME LET AGAINST. AND THOSE PROJECTS WERE ABLE TO GO FORWARD -- SO HOPEFULLY THAT THIS AGAIN WAS JUST STREAMLINING OF THE JUDICIAL REVIEW AND DOES NOT EXEMPT ANY OTHER PROJECTS FROM SEA QUEST AND WE WOULD ENCOURAGE YOUR IPHONE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AS EARLY AS A BEHALF OF STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL A WE WANNA THANK CENTER COUPLE YET -- FOR WORKING WITH US ON THE IMPORTANT LABOR STANDARDS THAT ARE ATTACHED TO THIS INVESTMENT. IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES WHERE PERHAPS THERE IS LACK OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. AS THE STATE LOOKS TO INVEST IN HOUSING -- WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A CRISIS OUT THERE WE KNOW THAT ALL FORMS OF INCOME OF ELIGIBILITY SHOULD BE -- BUILT FOR IN TERMS OF PRODUCTION FROM THE LOWEST TO THE MIDDLE TO HIGH -- BUT WE ARE FOCUSED NECESSARILY HERE WITH THIS LEGISLATION ON SOME OF THE IMPORTANT PROVISIONS THAT ALLOW 440% TO BE ALLOCATED FOR THE A A MINE. FOR YOU KNOW VERY IMPORTANT IS VERY SIGNIFICANT THAT IS VERY -- LOW INCOME FAMILIES THAT WILL BE BE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM THAT -- IN THAT I THINK ALSO DEALS WITH THE ISSUE OF GENTRIFICATION WHERE YOU HAVE. THE ABILITY TO PRODUCE HOUSING THAT -- ACTUALLY WILL DIVERSIFY THE COMMUNITIES BUT NOT ALSO VOWED KICK PEOPLE OUT NINE I MYSELF LIVED IN SAN FRANCISCO AND I'VE SEEN THE IMPACTS AND GENTRIFICATION -- IF THERE WERE HIGHER IN COMMAND OF LEVELS I THINK THAT WOULD BE BETTER SUITED FOR IN THE COMMUNITY I GREW UP IN THE MISSION DISTRICT BUT THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE -- THE IMPORTANT LABOR PROTECTIONS ARE ENSURE THAT THE INVESTMENT THAT IS BEING MADE AND AS A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES NOT LEAVE THE WORKERS THAT ARE BUILDING THE ASSETS BEHIND. RIGHT WE KNOW THAT CONSTRUCTION WORKERS CONTINUE TO SUFFER FROM LOW WAGES IN A NON UNIONIZED ENVIRONMENT. WHAT WE WANT TO JUST TRY TO DO HERE IS INCENTIVIZE THE USE OF THE PREVAILING WAGE TO LIFT UP EVEN WHEN THERE'S A NON UNION CONTRACTOR ON THE JOB? THAT THOSE NONUNION CONTRACTORS SO THAT THAT THAT DOES NOT. FURTHER CREATE MORE OF A NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE AFFORDABLE HOUSING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU. UP ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. AUDREY RETIRED CHECK ON WE HAVE A WEST FIELD IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. OF IS THERE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN RICHARD MARX AND ON BEHALF OF THE WESTERN ELECTRICAL CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION. UNFORTUNATELY IN OPPOSITION BUT WE DO APPLY THE AUTHORS EFFORT TO INCENTIVIZE OF THIS TYPE OF CONSTRUCTION AND OPPORTUNITIES OWNS. A BUT WE ARE TROUBLED BY OF WHAT WE BELIEVE IS A OF A TREND IN LEGISLATION LIKE SB. FIFTY FIVE THAT WE THINK IS IS VERY CONTRARY TO PUBLIC POLICY AND ACTUALLY. IS SOMETHING THAT A WERE SURPRISED THAT THIS COMMITTEE WOULD AGREE WITH AND THAT IS THE PROVISION THAT BARS. THE LABOR COMMISSIONER FROM ENFORCING WAGE AND HOUR RULES ON CERTAIN PROJECTS THAT ARE COVERED BY A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT. EXACERBATING THIS IS A SIMILAR WAIVER THAT ELIMINATES THE REQUIREMENT THAT CONTRACTORS KEEP IN SUBMIT CERTIFIED PAYROLL RECORDS TO VERIFY THAT THE WAGES ARE BEING PAID AND THE BENEFITS ARE BEING PAID. IF THIS TREND CONTINUES CAN WE EXPECT TO SEE SIMILAR PROVISIONS THAT SAYS THAT CALLOW SURE CANNOT ENFORCE HEALTH AND SAFETY RULES THAT OF THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING ADMINISTRATION. COULD NOT ENFORCE THESE PROVISIONS IF THERE'S A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT THIS LANGUAGE SHOULD BE REMOVED. THE WORKERS DESERVE THE PROTECTION. OF THE LABOR COMMISSIONER AND THE ONLY WAY TO VERIFY THAT THE ONLY WAY TO HAVE A RECORD TO VERIFY THAT WAGES AND BENEFITS ARE BEING PAID. IS D. COLLECTION AND THE SUBMISSION OF CERTIFIED PAYROLL RECORDS. WITHOUT LANGUAGE IN THE BILL WE ARE STRONGLY OPPOSED THANK YOU. I'M GOOD AFTERNOON I CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS SYDNEY FONG I'M A FELLOW WITH THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ALLIANCE. A COALITION REPRESENTING TWENTY THOUSAND ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN LATINO X. AFRICAN AMERICAN LOW INCOME RESIDENTS WHO HAVE LONG INJURED -- POLLUTION BURDENS ACROSS THE STATE -- WELL WE UNDERSTAND THAT AUTHORS AND STATED INTENTIONS BEHIND THE BILL WE CONTINUE TO OPPOSE SB TWENTY FIVE I'M HOWEVER WE'RE CURRENTLY AND CONVERSATIONS -- WEST -- AUTHORS OFFICE TO SEE IF WE CAN GET ALL OF OUR CONCERNS ADDRESSED -- FOR INSTANCE -- BOTHER PREVAILING WAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VERY COMMENDABLE -- WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THIS BILL WOULD INCENTIVIZE DEVELOPERS TO BUILD PROJECTS THAT WOULD NOT ACTUALLY SERVE LOCAL LOW INCOME RESIDENTS WOULD NOT GIVE THEM GOOD JOBS AND COULD LEAD TO GREATER. ENVIRONMENTAL HARMS I'M A WE HAVE FOUND LUXURY HOTELS AND OFFICE BUILDINGS AND FOR TECH WORKERS COULD BE SOME. THESE OWNS AND FUNDS -- WHICH COULD LEAD TO GREATER GENTRIFICATION AND DISPLACEMENT OF LONG TIME RESIDENTS NUMBER CONCERNS THAT -- THERE ARE NO LOCAL HIGHER PROVISIONS -- INCLUDED IN THE BILL -- ORGANIZATIONS WITHIN SAY HOW AND GROUPS SUCH AS STRATEGIC ALLIANCE FOR JUST ECONOMIES IN SOUTH LA -- AGREE THAT WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT JOBS GO TOO LONG LONG TIME LOW INCOME RESIDENTS THROUGH LOCAL HIGHER PROVISIONS. AND WE DON'T WANT TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC INCENTIVES FOR DEVELOPERS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE NEEDS OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES WE OF COURSE HAVE ADDITIONAL AT CONCERNS RELATED TO SEE CA AN EXPEDITED TO JUDICIAL REVIEW -- ASPECTS OF THE BILL THAT YOU CAN SHARE IN THE FUTURE IS NEEDED AND FOR SAY HI OR COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN AT THE FRONT LINES OF POVERTY AND POLLUTION AND SEE WHAT IS ONE OF THE LAST TOOLS THAT WE HAVE TO ENSURE ACCESS TO HEALTHY AIR LAND AND WATER. AS A WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND WE'D ACTUALLY LIKE TO REQUEST A COMMITMENT I'M FROM THE AUTHORS I TO HAVE A STAKEHOLDER MEETING PRIOR TO THE NEXT COMMITTEE TO ADDRESS OUR SHARED GOALS -- OF REGARDING PREVAILING WAGE AND MAKING SURE THAT WE DO NOT HARM AND THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE PEOPLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MELISSA ROMERO AT THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION OF THE BILL. EXPANDED X. VETTING JUDICIAL REVIEW OF SEE C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; ENVIRONMENT&lt;/c&gt;</u> TO REVIEW DOCUMENTS INCLUDING ENVIRONMENT. AT NEGATIVE DECLARATIONS DETERMINATIONS OF EXEMPTIONS AND ENVIRONMENT IMPACT REPORTS OF FOR SUCH A BROAD RANGE OF PRODUCTS WOULD UNDERMINE THE ENFORCEMENT OF THIS REALLY IMPORTANT FOUNDATION A LOT WHICH IS SEE WHAT. THE STATED PURPOSE OF THE BILL IS TO ADDRESS THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS WHICH IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT DOES HAVE VERY CLEAR CLIMB IMPACTS. BUT YET THE PROJECTS FUNDED THROUGH THE OPPORTUNITIES OWN FUNDS AREN'T LIMITED TO THE TYPES OF PROJECTS -- WHICH WOULD QUALIFY AS LONG AS ARE PARTIALLY FUNDED BY THOSE OPPORTUNITIES ON FUNDS AND WE DO UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR OTHER TYPES OF DEVELOPMENT IN -- IDENTIFIED OPPORTUNITIES OUNCE BUT STREAMLINING THE JUDICIAL PROCESS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW IN PUBLIC PARTICIPATION FOR THESE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES WHO ARE MORE THAN LIKELY ALREADY STRUGGLING WITH HISTORIC AIR WATER AND SOIL POLLUTION. WOULD POTENTIALLY PUT THEM AT EVEN GREATER DISADVANTAGE -- IN TERMS OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS THAT THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS WILL BE EXPERIENCING -- I WOULD ALSO JUST POINT OUT THAT THERE ARE ALREADY NUMEROUS STREAMLINING PROVISIONS ALREADY AVAILABLE AND THIS YOU CAN SEE WHAT APPLICABLE TO HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS INCLUDING STREAMLINING RELATE RELATED TO MASTER IN FOCUS ER'S. INFILL RESIDENTIAL MIXED USE AND TRANSIT PERHAPS PARITY PROJECTS AN EXEMPTION OR IT FOR TRANSIT A PARTY PROJECTS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUSLY ADOPTED SPECIFIC PLANS. AND THE RELEVANT REGIONAL SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY STRATEGIES AND EXPANSION OF IT EIGHT OF THE STATUTORY EXEMPTION FOR INFO RESIDENTIAL HOUSING BY INCREASING THE ALLOWABLE PERCENTAGE OF NEIGHBORHOOD SERVING COMMERCIAL USES WITHIN A PROJECT -- SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE EXISTING -- CHILLING VISIONS THAT THEY'RE IN LAW CURRENTLY AND I WOULD ALSO JUST POINT OUT THAT THE BILL DOES PROVIDE ADDITIONAL STREAMLINING FOR SEA QUEST. CHALLENGES FOR A TOTAL OF TWELVE PUBLIC FUNDS -- SO MUCH OPPORTUNITIES AND FUNDS BUT ELEVEN OTHERS -- AND SO FORTH FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSITION OF THE BILL THE BILL IN ORIGIN OF A THANK YOU THANK YOU. CAN STONE STONE ADVOCACY AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION ON BEHALF OF ASSOCIATED BUILDERS AND CONTRACTORS OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WE'RE NOT A PUSH TO THE PREMISE OF THE BILL BUT TO THE PROVISIONS THAT -- DISADVANTAGE OUR MEMBERS WHO ARE NON UNION CONSTRUCTION WORKERS. THANK YOU. I ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON THE END OF ASK IS -- HERE REGISTRY FIRST OF IN OPPOSITION FOR CENTER REYES PROPERTY NUMBER ME AS IS ONLY MY COMMENTS WITH -- A FULL COLLEAGUES SYDNEY FROM SARAH. THANK YOU. HI TIFFANY ANGER JUST IN OPPOSITION FOR LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUST ACCOUNTABILITY THANK YOU. MARK NEVER WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL -- ALSO OPPOSE THE BILL PARMALEE FOR THE EXPEDITED JUDICIAL REVIEW PIECE THANK YOU. BRENNAN DAWSON FOR SPHERICAL CALIFORNIA -- WE LIKE TO HONOR COMMENTS WAS HE'LL CV THANK YOU THANK YOU. BRIAN WILKIE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY ALSO IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. GINA ROBINSON WITH THE ASIAN PACIFIC ENVIRONMENTAL NETWORK ALSO IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. ARRIVES OVER AND BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. SOME OF HIS OFFICE -- HEAD QUESTION WHERE I WAS ON THIS BECAUSE I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER BEEN AGAINST THE BUILDING TRADES AND WITH THE ABC -- SO I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT BECAUSE ABSOLUTELY ON THAT ONE PROVISION I WANT TO BE CLEAR EIGHT THAT IS THE ONLY THING I'M SUPPORTIVE OF IN THIS BILL -- AND SO I THINK. THE AUTHOR. FOR TAKING THAT ON I CAN'T AT THIS POINT SUPPORT THIS BILL AND I'M SORRY -- I CAN'T I COULD SUPPORT IT IF WE WERE ONLY TALKING ABOUT THE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT SO HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS WITH OVER TWENTY FIVE UNITS I COULD -- I COULD GET BEHIND AN EXPEDITED REVIEW. FOR BUT I THINK AS AS DESCRIBED -- THIS IS FAR BIGGER THAN THAT MY PROBLEM ALWAYS WITH -- EXPEDITED REVIEW AND SEE WHAT IS QUITE FRANKLY -- THE FACT THAT WE LACK ANY WAY OF OF FROM AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IN A IN A ECONOMIC JUSTICE STANDPOINT. OF INVOLVING OURSELVES IN THE PROCESS WITHOUT SEEK. ONE SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT'S INAPPROPRIATE I DON'T I I THINK THAT THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IN ORDER TO HAVE A VOICE IS HEARD ON DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS THAT. DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT -- LOW INCOME AREAS THAT SOMETIMES. ALL DEVELOPMENT IS NOT GOOD YOU KNOW AND ALL JOBS ARE NOT GOOD -- AND SO BRINGING THINGS INTO A COMMUNITY JUST BASED ON THE IDEA THAT WE'RE GOING TO INVEST IN A COMMUNITY. SOMETIMES SOUNDS GOOD -- AT THE MACRO LEVEL BUT IN PLACE IS NOT GOOD SO I WANT TO PRESERVE THOSE TOOLS -- FOR THOSE IN A LOCAL AREA I I LIVE IN A DISTRICT THAT. I THINK THIS ENTIRE AREA COVERS -- AT ALMOST EVERY CENSUS TRACT IS IS ACTUALLY ENACTED IN IN. AN IMPOVERISHED AREA SO -- I I AT THIS POINT CAN'T SUPPORTED I ABSOLUTELY ON BE CLEAR ON THE RECORD WOULD SUPPORT A EXPEDITED REVIEW SEQUENCE EMPTION -- FOR HOUSING PROJECT THAT HAD PREVAILING WAGE. COMPONENTS TO IT BUT FOR NOW I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS BILL. SENATE JONES SAWYER -- SO I THINK THERE'S PROBABLY SOME CLARIFICATION -- THAT I PROBABLY NEED IN. AND SOME OTHER THINGS LOOK OUT NOT TO BE TOTALLY HYPOCRITICAL AYE I WAS LOOKING WHEN I FIRST GOT HERE. I WANTED TO DO. A A BILL THAT WOULD PROVIDE SEQUEL CERTAINTY. I'M AN INDIVIDUAL I WAS DIRECTOR WILL STAY FOR THE CITY OF LA. I'M ONE MOST EXASPERATING THINGS. THAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY USED TO DO TO ME WHEN I TRY TO BUILD A FIRE STATION LIBRARY FOR A POLICE STATION. THEY WILL COME OUT AND OPPOSED. DOES THE GODS BUILDINGS AND TO OPPOSE OF LIBRARY JUST DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME WHATSOEVER. BUT THEY HAD THE ABILITY TO QUIT SEQUEL TO BE ABLE TO SUE THE CITY DELAY THE PROJECT. DELAY LIBRARY. OR DELAY SCHOOL. IT JUST IT JUST DROVE ME CRAZY. AND AND SO I I NEVER WANTED US. TO NOT GO THROUGH THE WHOLE CYCLE PROCESS. BUT THE TAKE TEN YEARS TO BUILD SOMETHING. BECAUSE SOMEONE SUES AND ENSUED THEY LOSE THAT SUIT AND A SU AGAIN AND SEWER AGAIN. WHICH TO DRIVE ME NUTS AND RISEN DRAMATICALLY I WAS THE ONE THAT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PROJECT AND AND NOT GETTING DONE. IT IS DIFFERENT WHEN. IT'S YOUR MONEY. AND YOUR ON THE HOOK AS OPPOSED TO THE OTHER SIDE. AND SO I KNOW YOU HAVE EXPEDITED I KNOW WITH MY FRIENDS AND ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY IS BASED ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITY -- WHEN I SAY SEEK WITH CERTAINTY WHICH MEANS YOU GO THROUGH ALL THE TRAPS WITHIN GOVERNMENT PLANNING BUILDING SAFETY? PUBLIC WORKS FIRE DEPARTMENT. THAT ONCE YOU FINISH THAT PROCESS YOU CAN THEN BILLS -- FOR THEM FOR SOME PEOPLE THAT'S THAT'S EXPEDITE. TO ME THAT'S THE CERTAINTY OF HAJJI CHARETTE YOU HAD TO PULL DISCUSSION WITH THE COMMUNITY AND YOU'RE DONE. WE DON'T RE HASH IT ALL OVER AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND SO -- I'M GOING TO SUPPORT IT GOING FOR IT NOW. I WOULD LIKE SOME CLARIFICATION ON WHAT. EXPEDITED MEANS BOTH FROM YOUR SIDE AND THE OTHER SIDE. TO IS A LABOR PERSON I GUESS SOME DISTRESSING THINGS I WAS HEARING SO I WOULD LIKE THAT CLARIFIED FOR ME ALSO -- BECAUSE I USED TO HELP GET THOSE SHEETS IN THE CITY OF LA TO PUT MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE. WE'RE PAYING THE APPROPRIATE WAGES AND AND WE HAD A WHOLE DEPARTMENT THAT WASN'T. YOU KNOW BILL CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION THAT WAS THEIR SOLE JOB AS YOU KNOW -- TO TO ENSURE THAT MIGHT WE PAID NOT ONLY PEOPLE FROM THE COMMUNITY BUT WE PAY THEM THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF MONEY AND THEY ACTUALLY GOT PAID BY THE PRIME TO SELL. SO -- PROBABLY KNOW MORE ABOUT THIS THAN I EVER WANTED TO IN MY ENTIRE LIFE -- AND SO I I WANT TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION I THINK IT WILL ALSO BE GOOD. BECAUSE I'VE NEVER BEEN AGAINST LISTENING TO THE COMMUNITY AND HAVING THEM. A MEETING TO TALK ABOUT VIRAL JUSTICE CLAIMS SO THE REASON I WANTED TO DO THIS IN A BROADER. I WANTED IF YOU LIVE IN A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY I WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS. SEEK WITH CERTAINTY. BECAUSE I FIRMLY BELIEVE THE REASON IN SOUTH LA WHICH I REPRESENTING PEOPLE WERE COMMENTING ON WHERE I LIVE SO I FELT I SHOULD COMMENT. TO I DON'T HAVE A MALL. I DON'T HAVE A MOVIE THEATER. I DON'T HAVE SIT DOWN RESTAURANTS. BUT I DO KNOW. I ALSO DON'T HAVE ANY BIG BOX. THE MY DISTRICT. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT WALMART BUTTON TOM HAVE ANY BIG BOX. AND I KNOW IF IF WE HAD SEEK WITH CERTAINTY NAY ONLY TOOK ONE YEAR. TO BUILD A RESTAURANT IN MY A SIT DOWN RESTAURANT IN MY DISTRICT AS OPPOSED TO TAKING MAYBE TEN YEARS ON THE WEST SIDE OF LA. OR MORE IN SANTA MONICA SOME CASES. YES WE'RE GOING TO BUILD WILL START GETTING SOME OF THOSE SERVICES THAT WE DON'T HAVE AT ALL RIGHT NOW SELF TO LIKE. AND SO I I CAN. WERE LINKING WITH OPPORTUNITIES OWNS WHICH IS A LARGE PART OF MY DISTRICT -- MAKES SENSE BUT I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE -- THAT WE WE DO THIS IN A WAY THAT. MY COMMUNITY GET LEFT OUT RIGHT TO GENTRIFICATION PORTION OF THAT IS A HUGE CONCERN OF MINE RIGHT NOW IS PROBABLY THE THE MOST DANGEROUS PART OF WHAT'S GOING ON SOUTH LA -- I'M WORRIED THAT SOUTH DELAY WILL BE WHITE AGAIN SO I DO. I AM YES I DO HAVE SOME ISSUES. OF THAT WEEK WE DISPLACE THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN THERE FOR A VERY VERY LONG TIME BECAUSE THE HOUSING STOCK IS LOW RIGHT NOW PEOPLE COME BY. AND THEN WE'LL GET PRICED OUT. IS GONNA BE DIFFERENT LOOKING IMP GROUP OF PEOPLE THERE. AND SO. SIT DOWN RESTAURANTS PERHAPS AMERICAN LATINOS IN MY DISTRICT. AND SO WITH THAT OF A HOPEFULLY GETS OUT HERE SO THAT WE CAN THEN CONTINUE A CONVERSATION WE CAN MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS. I I DON'T KNOW WILL HAPPEN ON THE FLOOR BUT DEFINITELY -- I THINK YOU DESERVE SOME MORE THANK YOU. IT THINK THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT A YOU KNOW I I I REPEATED THAT THIS. THAT THE BILL DOES NOT CHANGE SYKORA. BECAUSE PEOPLE KEEP REPEATING THAT WERE WERE TRAMPLING ON C. CLASS AND ON THE SENATE FLOOR. SOMEBODY SAID IT WAS A EIGHT MS. AND WORSE THAN TRAMPLING ON SEA QUEST. IT DOESN'T DO THAT YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS. ALL IT DOES AND IN SO JUST JUST BY WAY OF REFERENCES -- BLACK WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY A COUPLE YEARS AGO LAST YEAR IN THE YEAR BEFORE I DID A SEEK I DID A SECRET STREAMLINING BILL. BECAUSE I FIGURED THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO DO IT THAT'S IT LET'S LET STREAMLINED THE SEQUEL PROCESS SO IT HAPPENS FASTER. AND AND I AND I TOOK A LOT OF HEAT FOR THAT SO I I I THE WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY TO USE PRIVATE DOLLARS. IN OUR POOREST COMMUNITIES. IS SEVEN YEARS WHERE I YEARS PAST NOW -- IF IT TAKES TEN YEARS TO BUILD THAT SIT DOWN RESTAURANT GUESS WHAT. THERE IS NOT GONNA BE ANY INVESTMENT IN OUR POOREST COMMUNITIES AND WHAT HIS CALIFORNIA DEN. FOR OUR DESIGNATED ZONES WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY ZERO WE HAVEN'T WE HAVEN'T SAID WE'RE GOING TO CREATE THIS OPPORTUNITY WE'RE GONNA PUT MONEY WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON ON BUILDING IN THESE COMMUNITIES. AND SO ON SO CITIES ARE LEFT. TRYING TO DO THE BEST THEY CAN SOME OF WE DID WE USED TO DO IT THROUGH THE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY THOSE ARE GONE. AND AND THIS IS PRIVATE DOLLARS AND SO SO -- SO NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE TO DO SEEK WHAT. BUT WE TOOK AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST -- LEED CERTIFICATION WITH NO GHG. EMISSIONS CREATED AND AND AND I'M HAPPY TO DO THAT BECAUSE I THINK WE OUGHT TO BE BUILDING TO THE HIGHEST STANDARDS IN THESE COMMUNITIES -- AND AND I'M HAPPY TO ADD THAT THE PROTECTION -- FOR LABOR AS WELL AND AND WE'LL LOOK INTO THE LOCAL HIGHER ORDINANCE FRANKLY. THAT'S AN OVERSIGHT -- I'VE ALWAYS SUPPORTED LOCAL HIGHER ORDINANCES THOSE ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT -- AND IN IN REGARDS TO THE COMMITMENT TO THE TO HAVE A STAKE HOLDERS MEETING ABSOLUTELY WE DO THAT ALL THE TIME AND WE'VE HAD SOME MEETINGS. THE KEY IS NOT TO MOVE THE GOAL POSTS BECAUSE WHAT I WAS HEARING FRANKLY IF WE CAN GET LUXURY HOTELS IN TO SOME OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. THAT'S THAT'S T. O. T. THAT'S TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX IT REALLY IS -- IS GOOD FOR THE COMMUNITY BUT BUT SO WE CAN DISAGREE OR AGREE OR DISAGREE ON ON SOME OF THE SOME OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION IT AND AND I'M WILLING TO TO CALL IT OUT. AND TO SAY WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN IN -- IN -- A BATTERY PLANT FOR EXAMPLE WHAT NOT INTERESTED IN THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AND IF WE CAN ARTICULATE THEM IN A WAY -- THAT -- THAT BAD BRING SOME SUPPORT WE'RE MORE THAN HAPPY TO DO THAT BUT THAT THAT THE THE OTHER THING THAT THAT I GET VERY CAREFUL ABOUT. IS IN ONE OF THE COMMITTEE HEARINGS IN THE SENATE I WAS ASKED IF I WOULD MAKE IT A 100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND YOU KNOW I JUST GOT TO SAY THAT THAT THAT WOULD BE A VIOLATION OF THE LAW TALKING ABOUT OVER CONCENTRATION OF OF POOR PEOPLE IN A IN AN ALREADY POOR COMMUNITY AND SO -- SO I'M TRYING TO BE BALANCED -- I'M TRYING TO GET A NUMBER THAT ACTUALLY WORKS WERE GOING TO GET IT THE INVESTMENT OF PRIVATE FUNDS AND I REALLY APPRECIATE -- YOUR COMMENTS BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS NOT. NOT TINKERED WITH WITH SECRET ALL WE'VE JUST SAD IF YOU'RE GOING TO SUE ON IT. THERE'S IT'S AN EXPEDITED PROCESS IN THE COURTS GOT IT THE COURT'S GOTTA GET TO IT M.. WITHIN A TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DAYS IF THEY CAN'T TO CAN TAKE LONGER BUT WE WANT WE WANT WE WANT CERTAINTY THAT'S THAT'S A CERTAIN TO YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AND I I'VE HAD WAY TOO MANY PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN PERENNIALLY OPPOSED. ON ON SEEK WELL IN THE CHASE AWAY THE DEVELOPERS IS WHAT IT AMOUNTS TO SO. WELL UP IN CENTER AYE AYE THE PURSE I PUSH IT WORK ON THIS AND AS WELL AS WORK IN THE BUILDING TRADES ON THIS WHEN THIS. BILL FIRST CROSSED MY DESK -- I CERTAINLY HAD CONCERNS OF THIS IS THE LABOR EMPLOYMENT MEANS WE'RE FOCUSING MORE ON THE LABOR CONCERNS -- AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF MOVEMENT THAT ALLOWS ACTUALLY THE BILL REACHES A BEER SPEAKING SUPPORT. AND SO I WANT TO COMMEND YOU FOR REALLY BE TAKING TO HEART THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED -- AND AS THIS -- BUT IF IT GETS THROUGH IT'S GOING TO NATURAL RESOURCES SO I'M I'M VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS REYES I KNOW THAT'S GOING TO GET A FULL VETTING. AND NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE AS WE CAN IMAGINE BUT I THINK IT'S HELPFUL TO HEAR IT HERE -- IN ADVANCE OF THE GOING TO NATURAL RESOURCES BECAUSE THOSE ARE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS THAT I THINK -- YOU KNOW THE THE THE NATURAL RESOURCES CHAIR AND HER COMMITTEE I KNOW I'M GOING TO PUT A LOT OF TIME AND ENERGY -- TO INTO JUST AS WE HAVE ON THE LABOR ASPECT OF THIS AND SO. THAT IS WHY THERE IS AN AYE RECOMMENDATION OF WITH THE A MAN'S THAT -- BUT I'VE COME THAT HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED. BY THE AUTHOR OF WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE CONTINUE TO WORK AND CONVERSATION -- ON THIS AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPOSITION FOR INDICATING THAT THEY LOOK FOR TO FURTHER CONVERSATIONS ON THIS BECAUSE THIS STILL HAS A LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE I GUESS THE ASSEMBLY FOR I THINK. ALL OF US UP YOU'RE LOOKING FOR MORE OF THAT MOVEMENT AND THAT CONVERSATION AS WE GO FORWARD AND BUT I THINK. AS EVIDENCED BY WHAT'S ALREADY HAPPENED IN THE RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THERE'S BEEN -- BEEN VETTED BY THE LABOR -- COMMITTEE I I THINK THAT YOU SHOWN THAT YOU CAN LOOK BILLION TO MAKE -- THOSE COMPROMISES -- IT BECAUSE I THINK YOUR GOALS LAUDABLE -- BUT I THINK THAT THE WAY IT'S DONE OF COURSE IS WHERE THAT THE DETAILS ARE WITH THE DETAILS LIKE -- LIKE IT GIVES US A SPACE TO TO EITHER SUPPORT OR NOT AS A GUEST OF THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR. AND SO -- THERE WAS I KNOW WHEN YOU WHEN YOU STARTED SPEAKING THERE WAS OF A MOTION BY OUR VICE CHAIR AND I DON'T BELIEVE THERE WAS A SECOND -- IT SOME OF MOTION BYE BYE SURE FOR AS OUR SECOND. A SIMILAR CARILLO IS THERE ANY OTHER COMMENT OR QUESTION FOR MANY OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

JURISDICTION TO ENFORCE STATE. PROHIBITING -- EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION IN AN ACTOR OWN ANTI DISCRIMINATION. COMMISSION LOS AN ORDINANCE -- FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES.

FOUR NINETY ONE AND THE GOVERNOR CONVENE A ADVISORY TASK FORCE YOU CAME UP WITH THE FOLLOWING THAT STATE TO CITIES ARE CAPABLE OF DOING THIS. I WILL -- TRUNCATE MY PRESENTATION A LOT MY TWO WITNESSES -- TO TELL THEIR TESTIMONY ARE WE HAVE ON YES HARRIS. AND FROM THE LA BLACK WORKERS CENTER AND JESSICA BUT THE FAR LITTLE BIRTH ARE LOW I'M SORRY FROM THE WHAT'S THE SOONER LONG POVERTY THANK YOU THANK A RESPECT LESS PRIVATE THANK YOU CENTER. GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLY LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS ON YES HARRIS AND I'M HERE REPRESENTING THE LOS ANGELES BLACK WORKER CENTER IN SUPPORT OF AND THE NEED FOR SB. TWO ONE EIGHT TODAY I AM HERE BEFORE YOU AS A HIGHLY SKILLED EDUCATED AMBITIOUS AND CURRENTLY UNEMPLOYED MASTER DEGREE EDUCATOR. AFTER WORKING IN THE HIGHEST ADMINISTRATIVE ROLE AT THE COLLEGIATE INSTITUTION FOR CLOSE. TO FIVE I WAS TERMINATED FOR REQUESTING A REYES. I WAS THE ONLY PERSON OF COLOR AND THE ONLY BLACK PERSON WORKING FOR THE COLLEGE. I WHILE SERVING SIMULTANEOUSLY AS THE DIRECTOR PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATION DIRECTOR OF ADMISSIONS AND REGISTRAR I SUCCESSFULLY MAINTAIN THESE POSITIONS WITHOUT A HIGHER UP SUPPORT SYSTEM OR AN ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF. AT THE BI WEEKLY SALARY OF ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT DOLLARS. WHEN I WAS ASKED TO TAKE ON ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES I REQUESTED AN INCREASE? FROM. FOURTEEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT DOLLARS BI WEEKLY TO TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS BI WEEKLY. MY REQUEST WAS MET WITH IMMEDIATE TERMINATION. THE AVERAGE SALARY FOR DIRECTOR OF ADMISSIONS ALONE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE DOLLARS. MY SALARY AT THAT TIME WAS THIRTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS. FIFTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS LESS THAN THE MAJORITY OF MY COUNTERPARTS. I UNDERSTAND ALL TOO WELL WAGE DISCRIMINATION AND DEGRADATION. AND ALL MY TIME AT THIS COLLEGE I NEVER RECEIVED A REPRIMAND NOR ANYTHING LESS THAN AN EXCELLENT REVIEW. A REASSIGNMENT DUTY TASK ARE COMPLETED WITH EXCELLENCE AND EFFICIENCY WITHOUT EXCEPTION AND WITHOUT ASSISTANCE WITH LITTLE IF ANY SUPERVISION. I CONSISTENTLY EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS. I LEFT THE OFFICE I WORKED AT FOR FOUR AND A HALF YEARS WITHOUT A SEVERANCE PACKAGE. LEAVING SICK TIME ACCRUED AND JUST SHY OF BEING VESTED. I WAS DENIED REFERENCES AS WELL AS LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION. I AM HERE BECAUSE I DID GO THROUGH THE PROPER CHANNELS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR HOUSING AND EMPLOYMENT. AND THERE WAS NOTHING THAT THEY COULD DO IT TOOK TWO MONTHS FOR THEM TO RESPOND TO THE ISSUES THAT I SUBMITTED IN MY CLAIM. I ALSO SOUGHT LEGAL REPRESENTATION REGARDING THE MATTER. AND THEY SAID THAT. THEY WERE JUST HAPPY THAT I WAS NO LONGER AT THAT POSITION. I'M NOT SURE IF ANY OF YOU UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS AND THE CAREER PATH THAT A HIGHER EDUCATION [inaudible] CONSISTED OF WHEN YOU ARE DENIED LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION WHEN YOU ARE DENIED. PREFERENCES. WHEN YOU HAVE THE? L. STANDING TO A IT IS LIKE. WHAT YOU HAVE DONE MEANS NOTHING? I AM HERE. BECAUSE THE CURRENT SYSTEMS NEED REINFORCEMENT. I DON'T BELIEVE ANYBODY. SHOULD HAVE TO EXPERIENCE BUT THE EXPERIENCED. NO MATTER WHAT LEVEL. THEY ARE WHATEVER POSITION THEY HOLD EDUCATED OR NOT EDUCATED. THIS WAS A VERY DEVASTATING EXPERIENCE AND I WOULD IMAGINE IT'S THE SAME FOR EVERYONE. SO AGAIN I'M HERE. SUPPORT OF SB TWO ONE EIGHT BECAUSE AGAIN. CURRENT SYSTEMS NEED REINFORCEMENT. IT'S NOT ENOUGH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE -- DESK ABOUT THE FOR THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. IN SUPPORT AND AS A SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. WE WERE A SPONSOR IN SUPPORT OF THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN BILL AND AND AT THE TIME THAT WE KNEW -- THAT THE FEDERAL PROTECTIONS AGAINST WORKER DISCRIMINATION WERE BEING ERODED -- WE HAD NO IDEA I DON'T THINK ANY OF US AS A NATION. THE KIND OF AND OF NATIONAL GROSS AND SUPPORT ENDORSEMENT OF HATE AND DISCRIMINATION -- AND HOW TIMELY THIS BILL WOULD BE WHEN I CAME BACK -- THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE IN THE MEANTIME AS CENTER BRADFORD HAS MENTIONED -- WE THERE WAS A WORK GROUP HELD BY THE F. B. H.. WE MET AT THE CHAMBER WAS THERE OTHER EMPLOYMENT ATTORNEY IN ADVOCATES WERE THERE. AND HERE IS A YEAR LONG PROCESS THIS THE BILL THIS IMPRINT TODAY WAS HIGHLY INFORMED BY THAT PROCESS AND AND WHAT WORKERS ARE ASKING. FOR IS A PROCESS -- THAT'S CLOSER TO HOME -- WHERE THEY CAN -- WORK WITH LEADERS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AT TO GET OUT THE WORD ABOUT IT WORKER PROTECTIONS AND HELP IN FORCE -- WORKER PROTECTIONS AGAINST DISCRIMINATION AND JUST TO NOTE THAT WORKER DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS ARE INCREASING REPORTS OF WORKER DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS ARE INCREASING AN ANKLE. IMPACTS NOT ONLY BLACK WORKERS OF THE BLACK WORKERS ARE THE MOST DISCRIMINATED AGAINST WORKERS LATINO WORKERS ARE AT THE NEXT. A GROUP OF PEOPLE WITH THE NEXT HIGHEST. LGBT Q. WORKERS ARE DISCRIMINATED MORE THAN 40% OF LESBIAN GAY BISEXUAL AND TRANS PEOPLE HAVE REPORTED DISCRIMINATION AT WORK. ASIAN AMERICANS HAVE REPORTED AT HIGH LEVELS AND INCREASING LEVELS OF DISCRIMINATION AT WORK AND NEWCOMERS DESPITE AMERICANS ORIGIN AS A COUNTRY OF IMMIGRANTS -- ARE FACING INCREASED LEVELS OF DISCRIMINATION AT WORK THIS IS A TIME WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS RETREATING FROM PROTECTIONS AGAINST WORKERS THAT WE SHOULD BE. MOVING FORWARD AND WE APPRECIATE. YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. YES MY NAME IS MINDY GARLAND I'M LEAD ORGANIZER WITH THE LA BLACK WORKERS CENTER -- WE ARE PROUD TO SUPPORT AS BETWEEN A MAN HERE FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU ALL MIGHT HAVE THINK THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS SERRA FLOCKS CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. DIPPING ACNE IS A CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. JUST BECAUSE THEN -- HAVE LEGAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. RENEE BAYARDO SEIU CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THANK YOU. KAELIN DEAN POLICY LINK AT THE ALLIANCE FOR BOYS MEN OF COLOR IN SUPPORT PROUD CO SPONSORS THANK YOU. KIM MORE YOU W. PROUD CO SPONSORS WE ARE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. SO ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS BETTER BECOME AFTER THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO THIS BILL -- AND CONCERNED ABOUT UNCERTAINTY AN INCONSISTENCY IT COULD CREATE THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WAS PART OF THE ESPY FORTY FOUR NINETY ONE ADVISORY. GROUP THAT TOOK A LOOK AT THIS ISSUE AND THAT WHILE THAT REPORT SAID THAT LOCAL ENFORCEMENT OF ANTI DISCRIMINATION LAWS IS FEASIBLE. IT ALSO SAID QUOTE IF THE LEGISLATURE WOULD DECIDE TO ALLOW FOR LOCAL ENFORCEMENT DE IF EACH WOULD URGE THAT CAREFUL ATTENTION BE PAID TO THE PRACTICAL POLICY CONSIDERATIONS. DISCUSSED BELOW AND WE DON'T BELIEVE THE BILL -- HAS ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED THOSE CONCERNS AND LIKE TO BRING A COUPLE TO YOUR ATTENTION. NUMBER ONE WERE CONCERNED THERE'S GONNA BE INCONSISTENCY AN APPLICATION OF THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT. THIS BILL ALLOWS LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO ACCEPT AND INVESTIGATE CLAIMS AND OF THE STATE WIDE. FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT AND A SET FORTH ON PAGE ELEVEN OF THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE REPORT THIS CAN CREATE SEVERAL CHALLENGES. INCLUDING LACK OF CONSISTENCY REGARDING THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS LACK OF CONSISTENCY WITH REGARD TO PROCEDURAL REGULATIONS LACK OF CONSISTENCY IN THE APPLICATION AND INTERPRETATION OF THE STATEWIDE BOX -- AND QUOTING FROM PAGE ELEVEN OF THAT REPORT. THEY SAID CALIFORNIANS IN DIFFERENT REGIONS WOULD EFFECTIVELY BE SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT LAWS FOR INSTANCE A HYPOTHETICAL CITY OF LOS ANGELES CIVIL RIGHTS COMMISSION COULD INTERPRET THE SAME PROVISIONS OF FEET HIGH. DIFFERENTLY FROM HYPOTHETICAL SAN FRANCISCO CIVIL RIGHTS COMMISSION. NOR CAN IT BE ASSUME THAT ANY CITY WOULD INTERPRET THE FEET HIGH IN THE SAME WAY THAT HE IF HE H. WOULD. CALIFORNIANS IN DIFFERENT REGIONS WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO DIFFERENT PROCEDURES IT'S A WE DON'T BELIEVE THOSE CONCERNS HAVE BEEN ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED IN THIS BILL. BUT WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED WITH THE LOCAL PATCHWORK OF ANTI DISCRIMINATION LAWS -- THIS BILL ALLOWS LOCAL ORDINANCES TO ADOPT THEIR OWN -- ANTI DISCRIMINATION LAWS. YOU KNOW FROM AN EMPLOYER'S PERSPECTIVE WE ALREADY HAVE LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE LAWS PAID SICK LEAVE LAWS BAN THE BOX LAWS OTHER AREAS NOT THAT THERE'S ANY DISAGREEMENT WITH THE POLICY OBJECTIVES OF THOSE LAWS BUT IF YOU'RE AN EMPLOYER OPERATE IN IN MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS. IT'S DIFFICULT TO COMPLY WITH ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT THEY'RE ALL A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT PROCEDURES AND PROCESSES AND THEN THERE'S A STATE LAW OVERLAPPING AND AS WELL. WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ ABOUT THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF BASICALLY WHERE YOU HAVE A STATEWIDE LAW. A GREAT STATE WEDLOCK ANY HAVE LOCAL ORDINANCES WELL AND THAT CAN CREATE CONFUSION EVEN FOR WORKERS WHO GET A PAY STUB THAT SAYS. STATEWIDE PAID SICK LEAVE HERE'S YOUR SAN DIEGO PAID SICK LEAVE IT CREATES CONFUSION AND IT'S CONFUSING FROM A COMPLIANCE PERSPECTIVE FROM AN EMPLOYER TO HAVE TO COMPLY. WITH DIFFERENT LAWS IN DIFFERENT YOUR JURISDICTIONS IT'S A WEEK WE FEEL LIKE THIS WOULD EXACERBATE THAT PROBLEM. FOR THESE REASONS WERE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU. KIM STONE STONE ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF THE CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA ALSO IN OPPOSITION FOR THE SAME REASONS IF YOU HAD -- DIFFERENT OFFICES ARE DIFFERENT EMPLOYEES IN DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS MUCH LIKE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND SENATORS DO FOR EXAMPLE YOUR CAPITAL STAFF IN YOUR DISTRICT STAFF MIGHT HAVE DIFFERENT -- RULES OR DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS WHICH WOULD BE AT DIFFICULT AND POTENTIALLY -- GOT CONFUSING AND COMPLICATED DISCRIMINATION IS VERY IMPORTANT AND NEEDS TO BE -- ADDRESS WE SHOULD HAVE. CONSISTENT STRICT RULES AND ALSO GIVE -- EMPLOYERS AND POTENTIAL DEFENDANTS THIS -- CONSISTENCY AND SECURITY SAID NO CLEARLY -- WHAT THE RULES ARE SO THAT THEY CAN FOLLOW THEM? THANKS THANK YOU. IS EVERYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. HELLO KITTY HAVE SOME OF THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION WERE OPPOSED FOR THE REASONS STATED THANK YOU. THE CALL RISE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURES AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION ALSO POST THANK YOU. OKAY SO BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE WE DO HAVE A MOTION. AS ANY AND AND THE SECOND WE HAVE ANY FURTHER COMMENT. SENATOR WHICH YOU LIKE TO CLOSE UP THANK YOU I THINK MRS HEARSES TESTIMONY IS PROOF AND ITSELF THAT HOW IMPORTANT IS MEASURE IS I KNOW THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS AND I KNOW IT'S GREAT CONCERN WITH HAVING A HODGEPODGE OF A DIFFERENT LAWS I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE. THE CASE I THINK THEY'RE GONNA USED. TO CONSTRUCT OF WHAT THE HOUSE STATES AND INTERPRETED JUST ON THE LOCAL LEVEL AND AND NOT CREATE THEIR OWN. POLICIES IN PROCESS THAT RUNNING A SKEW THAT SO ON THAT NOTE I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIGHT. THANK YOU SENATOR -- MANCHESTER OF CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. QUESTION IS DO PASSED TO JUDICIARY COMMITTEE KALRA AYE KALRA AYE FLORA CARILLO I YEP. INDIA I IN SALAS CAN SALAS AYE JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER I'D THREE OF US. BUT THAT WAS THE LONGEST PAUSE FOR AND I DON'T. KNOW. I APPRECIATED THE BILL. YOU KNOW MAYBE COME OVER THE THE THE BILL IS OUT THANK YOU SENATOR. IF WE CANNOT PROMOTION ON THE TO CONSENT ITEMS AND OF CENTER GALGIANI PLEASE TAKE A SEAT IN THE MEANTIME. WE HAVE -- SB THREE SIXTY TWO FROM PENN SB SIX NINETY BUT LEYVA. A MOST FROM SUMMER CREEL AS OUR SECOND ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR. THERE'S A SECOND FROM THE SUMMER GONZALEZ -- MATTER SECTOR TO CALL THE ROLL ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR ITEMS. SB THREE SIXTY THREE THE MOTION ON THREE SIXTY THREE IS TO PASS CONSENT TO HEALTH COMMITTEE. AN S. P. SIX NINETY EIGHT IS DO PASS -- TO APPROPRIATIONS CONSENT. KALRA AYE KALRA AYE FLORA CARILLO. IDEA. YEP HI GONZALEZ. GONZALEZ I JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER I THREE OF US. OKAY THE CONSENT CALENDAR IS OUT -- ITEM SIX SB FIVE THIRTY SENATE GALGIANI PLEASE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS SB FIVE THIRTY WILL REQUIRE THE DIVISION OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT. SHOULD DEVELOP AN INDUSTRY SPECIFIC HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION PREVENTION POLICY FOR USE BY EMPLOYERS IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. ONGOING REVELATIONS UNDERSCORED THE EXTENT TO WHICH WIDESPREAD SEXUAL HARASSMENT EXISTS WITHIN VIRTUALLY EVERY INDUSTRY. THESE INCIDENTS UNDERMINE THE ACHIEVEMENTS OUR STATE HAS MADE TOWARDS GENDER EQUITY IN THE WORKPLACE. SB FIVE THIRTY ADDRESSES THIS PROBLEM BY ESTABLISHING AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE TO DEVELOP INDUSTRY SPECIFIC ANTI HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION POLICY TRAINING STANDARDS FOR USE BY CONSTRUCTION EMPLOYERS. DIRECTLY ADDRESSING THE ON GOING HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION ISSUES ON THE JOB SITE WILL ENSURE ALL WORKERS ARE TREATED FAIRLY AND WILL HELP CHANGE THE CULTURE OF THE INDUSTRY. I'LL BE SUBMITTING AMENDMENTS AND APPROPRIATIONS TO CLARIFY THE TIME FRAME FOR RECEIVING THE TRAINING. THE MESSAGE METHODS BY WHICH AN EMPLOYER CAN PROVIDE THE TRAINING AND TECHNICAL GRAMMATICAL CHANGES WITH ME TODAY IS SATURDAY YES AT THE STATE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU. MEASURE MEMBERS AS ARE THE OTHER BEHALF F THE STATE BILL AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL -- BUT WE WERE THANKFUL FOR CENTER GALGIANI RE INTRODUCING THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION IT WAS ACTUALLY COMPANION BILL TO A BILL THAT -- SOMEONE WILL MCCARTY -- RAN IT WILL SIGNED LAST YEAR OFFER TECHNICAL ISSUES DID NOT GET SIGNED UP PRIMARILY BECAUSE IT WAS HOUSE AT THE OF WAS NOT HOUSE AT THE FE H. BUT WE DON'T BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE BECAUSE IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY MOST OF OUR WORK IS DONE THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL. RELATIONS SO WE'RE SPECIFICALLY TRYING TO DO IS TO CREATE A CONSTRUCTION SPECIFIC TYPE OF POLICY WHERE -- SEXUAL HARASSMENT CAN BE DEALT WITH IN A IN A MANNER THAT ACTUALLY WORKS AND ONE EXAMPLE THAT WE'RE% TRYING TO DO HERE WITH THE BILL IS THAT. A A PIECE OF LEGISLATION WAS PASSED LAST YEAR BY SENATOR MITCHELL DEALING WITH TRAINING -- FOR EMPLOYEES ONE HOUR TRAINING FOR EVERY NEW HIRE -- WITHIN THE SIX MONTHS WELL IN THE UNIONIZED INDUSTRY MULTI EMPLOYER A DIFFERENT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS OUR MEMBERS ARE WORKING FOR MULTIPLE EMPLOYERS WITHIN THE SIX MONTH PERIOD. AND SO UNDER THOSE PROVISIONS WE WOULD HAVE TO THE HAVE OUR MEMBERS RETRAIN OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. SO TWO PARTS TO THIS BILL ONE PART IS. TO SELECT THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND STATE AGENCIES PROVIDING FEEDBACK ON HOW TO CREATE THOSE POLICIES ARE AMEND THE POLICIES ARE AN EXISTING CODE TODAY. AND ALSO CREATE NEW ONE SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE A BETTER JOB SITE ENVIRONMENT FOR EVERYONE SPECIFICALLY WOMEN WHICH WE ARE ACTIVELY TRYING TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. AND TO WE HAVE DONE SOME IN ROADS BUT WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. THE SECOND PIECE IS TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF THE TRAINING THAT I REFERENCE EARLIER IN MY COMMENTS. I THINK IS A VERY GOOD PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT WOULD CHANGE JOBS I CULTURE ENCOURAGE MORE WOMEN TO JOIN THE TRADES FOR THOSE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS BRETT BARROW REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA CHAPTERS A NATIONAL LIBERAL CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL PLAN HE BE HEATING AND PIPING INDUSTRY. UNITED CONTRACTORS AND THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA LA TRADES AND WE'RE HERE TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT AND JUST ECHO WHAT MISTER DE AS A SAID. YOU KNOW WE ARE A MULTI AN EMPLOYER OF CONSTRUCT AND WE RARELY DO WE FIND EMPLOYEES ON JOBS LONGER THAN. OF SIX MONTHS TO YEAR -- THERE IT'S HIGHLY MOBILE SO THAT THAT THAT MOBILIZATION PROVISION IS IS KEY OF A KEEP IMPORTANCE TO US SO WITH THAT I SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR SCOTT GOVERNOR BEHALF THE CONSTRUCTION EMPLOYERS ASSOCIATION IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER CHAIR MEMBER SERRA FLOCKS OF CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION IN SUPPORT [inaudible] THANK YOU. MY QUESTION REPRESENTING DISTRICT COUNCIL SIXTEEN PAINTERS AND ALLIED TRADES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. A BRING BACK TO COMMITTEE IS ARE THERE ANY COMMENTS MOTIONS. OKAY. OKAY SPILL MOTION A SECOND YES IMMIGRANT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR US SENATOR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS BILL BACK. INTO THE PROCESS -- I DO BELIEVE IN AGREE WITH THE TRAITS THAT THERE IS A VERY UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY FOR WOMEN ESPECIALLY WOMEN OF COLOR. TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A GOOD JOB A LONG TERM AND BE SUSTAINABLE TO THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES I LOVE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR WINS OUR TIMES CONVENIENCE. THANK YOU. I APOLOGIZE SO I'D I'D SKIPPED OPPOSITION AND SO I WELL WILL -- GO JUMP BACK REALLY QUICK AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT -- OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS RICHARD MARKETS AND WE CERTAINLY AGREE ON BEHALF THE WESTERN ELECTRIC CONTRACTORS WE AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR IN THE SPONSOR. OF THAT THE TREATMENT OF WOMEN A CAN BE. A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM ON CONSTRUCTION WORK SITE. A WE DO AGREE WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF CREATING A INDUSTRY SPECIFIC TRAINING ARE ONLY OBJECTION A COMES FROM THE RECENT AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL THAT LIMIT THE AUTHORITY OR THE ABILITY OF ONLY. ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT TO PROVIDE PROVIDE THE TRAINING. MY CLIENTS ALL OF PROVIDE APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING -- AND WHILE MOST OF THE JOURNEY WORKERS FOR ARE EMPLOYING CONTRACTORS I HAVE A FAIRLY CONSISTENT POINT. RECORD WITH THOSE A CONTRACTORS. THE APPRENTICE'S DUE TRAVEL FROM OF WORK SITE TO WORK SITE FROM EMPLOYER TO EMPLOYER WE THINK THAT IT WOULD BE CERTAINLY APPROPRIATE AND THERE IS NO NEED TO LIMIT. OF THE TRAINING AUTHORITY TO ONLY THOSE -- OPPRESSION OF PROVIDERS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT -- WE BELIEVE THAT ANY PRESSURE PROGRAM THAT'S APPROVED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE ARE SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO PROVIDE THE TRAINING. WE ALL APPLY. AND COMPLY WITH THE SAME -- INDUSTRY STANDARDS UP FOR A TRAINING THE APPRENTICES AND WE THINK THAT THIS WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THAT WOULD BE ADDED TO THE CURRICULUM FOR THAT REASON WE'RE OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED. THANK YOU FOR THE FEEDBACK ANY ONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. OKAY -- SOME OF HIS OFFICE I JUST HAD A QUESTION ABOUT WHAT WOULD THAT BE OF ONE OF THE COURSES YOU. CHARGE APPRENTICES FOR OR WOULD THIS BE A NEW FREE COURSE. AS I'M SURE YOU ARE AWARE WE DON'T CHARGE OUR PRACTICES FOR ANY TRAINING IT IS FULLY EMPLOYER PAID -- WAR WE DO RECEIVE A MODEST CONTRIBUTION FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR THE RELATED SUPPLEMENTAL INSTRUCTION -- OUR PRACTICES LEAVE THE PROGRAM WITH ZERO DEBT AND HAVING MADE NO PAYMENTS DURING THE ENTIRE COURSE OF THEIR ENROLLMENT AS AN APPRENTICE. I THINK THAT THAT'S I THANK YOU THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN THE COURSES I'VE SEEN OFFERED AT A PRICE SO IT'S GOOD TO HEAR THAT -- BUT WE DEFINITELY AT LEAST IN THE PAST HAVE SEEN THE CHARGING FOR CLASSES -- THAT IS DIFFERENT WELL THAT MUST BE A NEW. A NEW FEATURE THAT YOU'RE OFFERING AND I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT. BECAUSE THERE DEFINITELY WAS. THE R. A. B. C. PARTNERS IF YOU WELL DEFINITELY. CHARGED -- FOLKS TO GO THROUGH A TRAINING PROGRAM IN ORDER TO BECOME APPRENTICES. MY CLIENTS HAVE NEVER CHARGE FOR PROTECTION [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. I WILL ADD. WITH WHICH I OKAY THANK YOU SO AS I SOON THOSE WILL BE FREE COURSES. IF YOU EVER HAVE BEEN GRANTED. AND SO -- ONE OF THE THANK YOU CENTER FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I THINK HAVING INDUSTRY SPECIFIC -- TRAINING IS APPROPRIATE I ALSO THINK IT WILL BE A LESSEN THE BURDEN ON SOME OF THE EMPLOYERS THAT ALSO HAVE TO DO TRAINING. FOR FOR FOLKS MIGHT BE THERE FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND INSTEAD WE ARE CERTAIN THAT. THOSE ARE WORKING ON THE SET ARE GETTING APPROPRIATE TRAINING I KNOW THAT SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS WITHOUT A LITTLE LATER WE NEED A LITTLE WORK ON THE LANGUAGE THAT CAN CERTAINLY BE DONE. AS THIS GOES FORWARD IT WILL BE IF PASSED WHEN APPROPRIATIONS I'M SURE APPROPRIATIONS CHERYL MAKE SURE THAT THE AMENDMENTS ARE DONE AN APPROPRIATE MANNER -- ANY FURTHER COMMENT. IF NOT WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE THE RELIGION I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE THE THANK YOU. MA'AM SECTOR CALL ROLL PLEASE. MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS KALRA AYE KALRA AYE FLORA. FLORA I CARILLO [inaudible] REAL IDEA. YEP I CAN SALAS. GONZALEZ I JONES SAWYER JONES SAWYER I THREE OF US. WHAT THE BILL'S OUT -- SET OF THANK YOUS UNDERMINING SB. SIX EIGHTY EIGHT I WANT TO STICK ROSE AGAIN I HAD THREE BILLS AND HEALTH AT ONE BILL THAT JUST GOT PRESENTED LEFT. AND SO CENTER MINING -- OF THE BILL I WITH THE THANK YOU MOTION TO DO PASSAGE TO SHERRY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. BRIEFLY CURRENTLY THE LABOR COMMISSIONER HAS THE AUTHORITY TO ASSESS UNPAID MINIMUM IN OVERTIME WAGES THROUGH A CITATION ISSUED TO THE EMPLOYER. THESE CITATIONS MAY BE PROSECUTED TOGETHER IN A SINGLE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING WHEN THE CITATIONS ARE APPEALED. CONTRACT WAGES HOWEVER MAY BE ENFORCED BY THE LABOR COMMISSIONER ONLY THROUGH A CIVIL ACTION FILED IN SUPERIOR COURT. SB SIX EIGHTY EIGHT GIVES THE LABOR COMMISSIONER THE AUTHORITY TO ASSESS UNPAID CONTRACTUAL WAGES THROUGH A CITATION ISSUE AGAINST AN EMPLOYER. THIS BILL ONE SURE WORKERS ARE PAID THEIR APPROPRIATE CONTRACTUAL WAGES IN A TIMELY MANNER -- BY PERMITTING I'M PAID CONTRACT WE JUST TO BE COLLECTED THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF CITATIONS. IT ALSO MAKES IT EASIER FOR AN EMPLOYER WHO APPEALS TO CONSOLIDATE ACTIONS AND NOT BE DRAGGED INTO SUPERIOR COURT -- SO THAT IT RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND WOULD LIKE 2%. NOW A PERMANENT FIXTURE OF YOUR COMMITTEE MISTER CAESAR THE S. SO WE GET A NAME PLATE -- I APOLOGIZE -- THIRTY IS ON BEHALF OF THE PROVIDING VERY MEAN FOR THE TESTIMONY TODAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.
