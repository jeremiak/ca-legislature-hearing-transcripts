ARMENIA- JUST THE HISTORICAL

00:39:20.858 --> 00:39:23.227
CONTEXT A BRIEF HUNDRED AND

00:39:23.294 --> 00:39:23.961
SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIX YEARS

00:39:24.028 --> 00:39:26.530

ERADICATE. AN INDIGENOUS

00:39:29.133 --> 00:39:32.603
POPULATION LIVING IN AN AREA

00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:33.170
THAT HAD BEEN THERE FOR FIVE

00:39:33.237 --> 00:39:38.109
THOUSAND YEARS. AND- WHILE THE

00:39:38.175 --> 00:39:39.643
LAST HUNDRED YEARS HAVE SEEN

00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:41.512
MANY SHIFTING POLITICAL TIDES

00:39:41.579 --> 00:39:43.681
SOVIET UNION WAS ESTABLISHED

00:39:43.748 --> 00:39:44.648

UMBRELLA- OF THE SOVIET UNION-

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.555
AND THEN GAINED INDEPENDENCE

00:39:51.622 --> 00:39:53.124
SINCE BEEN INDEPENDENT FOR

00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:54.125
THIRTY YEARS AND IT'S BEEN

00:39:54.191 --> 00:39:57.795
STRIVING TO BECOME A PARTNER OF

00:39:57.862 --> 00:39:59.797
THE UNITED STATES IT'S BEEN

00:39:59.864 --> 00:40:02.133
TAKING STEPS TO ADDRESS

00:40:02.199 --> 00:40:04.068
TECHNOLOGY ISSUES HEALTH CARE

00:40:04.135 --> 00:40:05.803
ISSUES TRANSPORTATION AND

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:07.338
LOGISTICS GIVEN THAT IT'S A

00:40:07.404 --> 00:40:09.306
LANDLOCKED COUNTRY. AND IT

00:40:09.373 --> 00:40:11.375
HASN'T KNOWN EXACTLY HOW TO

00:40:11.442 --> 00:40:12.710
SOMETIMES UNFORTUNATELY WORK

00:40:12.777 --> 00:40:15.646
WITH ITS NEIGHBORS BECAUSE OF

00:40:15.713 --> 00:40:16.280
ITS NEIGHBORS DON'T REALLY WANT

00:40:16.347 --> 00:40:18.415
TO WORK WITH. THEY STILL HAVE

00:40:18.482 --> 00:40:20.417
THE IDEA AND CONCEPT OF

00:40:20.484 --> 00:40:22.286
ERADICATING IT AND HE TOOK

00:40:22.353 --> 00:40:25.689
THOSE STEPS JUST LAST FALL. IN

00:40:25.756 --> 00:40:27.825
THE MIDDLE OF THE WORLD

00:40:27.892 --> 00:40:29.794
PANDEMIC WHICH WE'VE NOT

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:31.762
EXPERIENCED. IN THE LAST

00:40:31.829 --> 00:40:34.498
HUNDRED YEARS. SEVERITY OF

00:40:34.565 --> 00:40:37.034
WHICH WE HAVEN'T EXPERIENCED-

00:40:37.101 --> 00:40:39.270
AND DURING THE TIME OF A BUT

00:40:39.336 --> 00:40:41.672
MINUTES US ADMINISTRATION THAT

00:40:41.739 --> 00:40:44.975
DID NOT NECESSARILY CARE ABOUT.

00:40:45.042 --> 00:40:46.544
WHAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN TO THIS

00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:47.978
TINY POPULATION THAT HAS

00:40:48.045 --> 00:40:51.715
CONTRIBUTED SO MUCH AND IS A

00:40:51.782 --> 00:40:53.851
STE POTENTIALLY A VERY STRONG

00:40:53.918 --> 00:40:57.588

ARMENIAN. GENOCIDE RESOLUTIONS

00:41:07.898 --> 00:41:10.234

00:41:12.169 --> 00:41:14.305
BELIEVE ALMOST EVERY WITH THE

00:41:14.371 --> 00:41:15.773
EXCEPTION OF MAYBE ONE MEMBER

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:17.508
WHO WASN'T ELECTED AT THE TIME

00:41:17.575 --> 00:41:19.610
IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN VOTING

00:41:19.677 --> 00:41:21.612
TO SUPPORT THE DIVESTMENT BILL.

00:41:21.679 --> 00:41:22.880
WHICH GOVERNOR NEWSOM ALSO

00:41:22.947 --> 00:41:25.516
SIGNED WHICH TELLS YOU WHAT THE

00:41:25.583 --> 00:41:27.751
MORAL COMPASS OF OUR STATE IS

00:41:27.818 --> 00:41:29.954
WE'RE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:31.021
BUT UNFORTUNATELY OUR FEDERAL

00:41:31.088 --> 00:41:34.625
GOVERNMENT THEY STILL HELD TO

00:41:34.692 --> 00:41:36.460
OUTDATED GEOPOLITICAL AND OIL

00:41:36.527 --> 00:41:41.098
INTERESTS. AND SO IT FOCUSES ON

00:41:41.165 --> 00:41:45.169
NARROWLY CONSTRUCTED PARADIGMS.

00:41:45.236 --> 00:41:49.607
OF PAST GENERATIONS. AND SO

00:41:49.673 --> 00:41:51.475
UNTIL OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:41:51.542 --> 00:41:53.344
