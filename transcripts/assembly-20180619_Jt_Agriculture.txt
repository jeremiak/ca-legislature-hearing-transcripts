BAND SALE OF CERTAIN NON COMPLYING PRODUCTS -- I AND MY NAME IS. ON A COMPUTER IN THE ASSEMBLY CHAIR ON AGRICULTURE AND WHY LIKE TO WELCOME YOU TO THIS JOINT. JOINT HEARING -- PURSUANT TO SECTION NINETY THIRTY FOUR OF THE ELECTIONS CODE THE LEGISLATURE IS REQUIRED TO HOLD PUBLIC JOINT INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS ON MEASURES THAT QUALIFY FOR THE BALLOT. TODAY'S HEARING SERVES TO MEET THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENT. I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND EVERYONE IN ATTENDANCE TODAY THAT THE COMMITTEE HEARING IS ONLY INFORMATIONAL AND THIS COMMITTEE HAS NO AUTHORITY OR POWER TO MAKE CHANGES OF ANY KIND TO THE PROPOSED PROPOSITION. THE SUCCESSFUL PASSAGE OR FAILURE OF THIS ISSUE RESTS IN THE HANDS OF ALL CALIFORNIA VOTERS. THAT SAID I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO AN INFORMATIVE DISCUSSION THAT WILL EXAMINE THE CURRENT STATE OF FARM ANIMAL CONFINEMENT. IT IS MY INTENT THAT THIS HEARING EXAMINE INFORMATION NECESSARY TO BEST INFORM THE PUBLIC OF THE INITIATIVES CONTENT. AND PROVIDE A FORUM FOR PUBLIC DISCOURSE FOR THOSE OF YOU INTERESTED IN TESTIFYING DURING THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD OF THE HEARING. PLEASE SIGN UP WITH THE SERGEANTS BUT ALSO ASK THAT PUBLIC COMMENT BE LIMITED TO ONE MINUTE PER PERSON SO THAT SO TODAY. AND WE EXPECT -- AS SENATORS AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS TO COME IN AND OUT BOB BUT WE'RE READY TO PROCEED TODAY SO -- IF WE COULD. I'D LIKE TO ASK PANEL NUMBER ONE WHICH IS OVER HERE BY THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SHAUN MARTIN PRINCIPLE FISCAL AND POLICY ANALYST WELCOME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY -- MY NAME'S SHAH MARTIN AND I WILL BE SPEAKING FROM A HANDOUT AND AND SO FIRST I I'M GOING TO GO OVER THE LA A ROLE IN THE INITIATIVE PROCESS AND I'M GONNA PROVIDE YOU WITH SOME BACKGROUND INFORMATION RELATIVE TO THE INITIATIVE. THEN I'LL GO OVER THE PROPOSAL AND BRIEFLY DESCRIBE OUR ESTIMATE OF THE FISCAL A FAX SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE ONE IN YOUR HANDOUT. ON ARE ROLE IN THE INITIATIVE PROCESS IS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE ROLE THAT YOU TYPICALLY SEE AS PLAY IN FRONT OF BUDGET SUB COMMITTEES -- AND POLICY COMMITTEES WHERE WE IN THOSE THOSE SETTINGS WE OFTEN MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS. WITH REGARD TO THE INITIATIVE PROCESS STATE LAW REQUIRES ARE OFFICE ALONG WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- TWO AN IMPARTIAL FISCAL ANALYSIS OF EACH INITIATIVE. AND THE LAW REQUIRES IS NOW ASSESS. TO PROVIDE AN ESTIMATE OF THE MEASURES FISCAL IMPACT ON STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. ON THE SUMMARY THE FISCAL IMPACT IS INCLUDED ON PETITIONS THAT ARE CIRCULATED FOR SIGNATURES FOR THE INITIATIVE. AND AFTER WE'VE BEEN. COMPLETE THAT PROCESS BY TO AN ANALYSIS OF THE MEASURE BY. IT AN IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS HAVE FOR THE STE AYE STATEWIDE BALLOT PROPOSITIONS FOR THE STATEWIDE VOTER INFORMATION GUIDE. NOW SINCE INCLUDES A DESCRIPTION THE MEASURE IN THE FISCAL FACTS AND WE'RE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF PREPARING THAT ANALYSIS FOR INITIATIVES THAT ARE QUALIFIED OR HAVE A REASONABLE CHANCE OF QUALIFYING. FOR THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BALLOT. SO CONSISTENT WITH THEIR MANDATE TO PROVIDE BY IMPARTIAL FISCAL ANALYSIS OF STATEWIDE BALLOT PROPOSITIONS TODAY I'M REALLY LIMITING MY COMMENTS TO A DESCRIPTION OF THE MEASURE AND IT'S FISCAL A FAX. SO IF YOU CAN TURN TO PAGE TWO IN THE HANDOUT. OUT WHERE WE GIVE SOME BACKGROUND INFORMATION. CALIFORNIA LEADS THE NATION IN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION THAT CALIFORNIA ALSO BUY SOME FOOD FROM OTHER STATES INCLUDING MOST OF THE EGGS AND PORK THAT CALIFORNIANS HE'D. COME RECENTLY THERE BINGO I'M PUBLIC INTEREST IN FARM ANIMAL PRODUCTION PRACTICES AND HOW THESE PRACTICES AFFECT THE TRIP BUT I TREATMENT OF ANIMALS. AND VARIOUS ANIMAL FARMING INDUSTRIES HAVE PRODUCED GUIDELINES AND BEST PRACTICES AND IMPROVING THE CARE AND HANDLING OF FARM ANIMALS. AND ALSO SOME MAJOR FOOD RETAILERS HIGH AND RESTAURANT CHAINS IN OTHER MAJOR FOOD RELATED BUSINESSES HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT THEY'RE MOVING TOWARDS REQUIRING THEIR SUPPLIERS TO PROVIDE. THAT AYE ANIMALS WITH MORE SPACE TO MOVE AROUND FOR EXAMPLE BY ONLY PURCHASE SEEN -- EGGS FROM FARMERS TO USE CAGE FREE. HOUSING FOR HANDS. A BIT OF BACKGROUND ON PREVIOUS PROPOSITIONS PROPOSITION TWO GENERALLY PROHIBITS CALIFORNIA. THE FARMERS WHO HOUSING PREGNANT PIGS CABS REYES REVEAL AND EGG LAYING HANDS IN CAGES ARE CRATES THAT DO NOT ALLOW THEM TO TURN AROUND FREELY. LIE DOWN STAND UP AND FULLY EXTEND THEIR LIMBS AND UNDER PROPOSITION TO ANY PERSON WHO VIOLATES THE LAW IS GUILTY OF THE MISDEMEANOR -- FOLLOWING UP ON PROPOSITION TWO THE LEGISLATURE PASSED A LAW. ADD THAT MADE IT ILLEGAL FOR BUSINESSES WHEN YOU TO SELL EGGS INCLUDING OUT OF STATE FARMS. THAT PRODUCE FROM HANDS HOUSE WAYS TO JOHN NEAT PROPOSITION CHOOSE EGG LAYING. SKY STANDARDS FOR EGG LAYING HENS AND NOW IF YOU'LL TURN TO PAGE FOUR IN THE HANDOUT. I MEAN TO GO OVER THE WHAT OZELL. I THIS INITIATIVE. BUT THE REQUIREMENTS WOULD BE PHASED IN FOR THE TAX OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS IN INCREMENTS ARE REGARDING THE MINIMUM SIZE OF HOUSING HE'S FOR EGG LAYING HANDS. BREEDING PIGS AND COWS REYES TRIVIA. THAT REQUIREMENTS GENERALLY SPECIFIED THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF FLOOR SPACE THAT MUST BE PROVIDED TO EACH EGG LAYING HEN. A BREEDING PIG OR CAFES FOR VEAL IN TERMS OF SQUARE INCHES OR SQUARE FEET. THE MEASURE WOULD MAKE IT ILLEGAL FOR BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA TO SELL EGGS PORK REVEAL THAT WERE PRODUCED FROM ANIMALS HOUSE YOU MIGHT. NOT MEET THE MEASURES REQUIREMENTS THAT SELLS BEEN APPLIES TO PRODUCTS FROM CALIFORNIA AND OUT OF STATE. A VIOLATION OF THE PROPOSITION WOULD BE A MISDEMEANOR. AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HOUSE ARE REQUIRED UNDER THE MEASURE TO PROMULGATE REGULATIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE PROPOSITION. AND NOW TURNING TO PAGE FIVE I'M GONNA CONCLUDE BY GOING OVER THE FISCAL A FAX -- COMPARED TO CURRENT PRACTICE USED BY SOME FARMERS. THE PROPOSITION REQUIRE MORE SPACE AND ALSO ALTERNATE METHODS OF HOUSING FOR BREEDING PIGS CABS REYES REVEALING A GLENN HANDS. POTENTIALLY RESULTING IN HIGHER PRODUCTION COSTS TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE HIGHER PRODUCTION COSTS BECAUSE SOME FARMERS TO EXIT THE BUSINESS OR OTHERWISE REDUCE THEIR OVERALL PRODUCTION AND PROFITABILITY THERE COULD BE REDUCE STATE AND LOCAL TAX REVENUES. THE POTENTIAL DECREASE IN STATE% AND LOCAL TAX REVENUES FROM FIVE BUSINESSES IS LIKELY NOT TO EXCEED THE LOW MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY. I'M AN AND OTHER POTENTIAL FISCAL FACTS -- STATE COST RANGING UP TO TEN MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY TO ENFORCE THE MEASURE. THAT DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE WOULD LIKELY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO ENFORCE THAT PROVISIONS. OF THE PROPOSITION THAT ESTABLISH REQUIRE. OF HOUSING USE FOR EGG LAYING HENS ARE BREEDING PIGS AND CATS REST RUBIO. AND MAKE IT ILLEGAL FOR BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA TO SELL EGGS PARKER VEAL THAT WERE PRODUCED FROM ANIMALS HOUSE IN WAYS THAT DO NOT MEET THE MEASURES REQUIREMENTS. SO THAT CONCLUDES MY OF REVIEW FOR THE DAY I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. QUESTIONS OF MISTER MARTIN. I HAVE I HAVE ONE QUESTION AND THAT -- AT AGE. THEIR REPORT YOUR REPORT INDICATES THAT -- FEE. AND I WAS LOOKING FOR THE EXACT -- THAT MOST OF THE EGGS AND PORK THE CALIFORNIANS EAT. ARE PRODUCED IN OTHER STATES. SO FOR TALKING ABOUT IMAGE DUMP A MAJORITY ARE MOST OF THE EGGS AND PORK -- IT IN AND THAT PROJECT ENDS UP. IT IF THIS PROPOSITION PASSES IN THE PRODUCT AND JEFF. IN CALIFORNIA HOW WOULD CALLASPO WOULD OUR REGULATORY. AGENCIES DETERMINE THAT THE THAT THE PRODUCT QUIZ. WAS GROWN PURSUANT TO OUR RULES AND REGULATIONS AS OPPOSED TO ANY OTHER STATE TO RULES AND REGULATIONS. SO THAT'S WERE THE ARE ESTIMATE OF COSTS THAT RANGING UP TO TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE COME IN. AND WE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH THAT DEPARTMENT REGARDING THAT WHAT THEY WOULD NEED TO PUT IN PLACE IN ORDER TO ENFORCE THE MEASURE. AND THEY AYE SAID THAT THEY WOULD NEED TO HAVE -- A SYSTEM IN PLACE POTENTIALLY A LICENSING OR REGISTRATION SYSTEM FOR OUT OF STATE PROVIDERS. ARAB OR AYE AYE STATE FARMERS WHO PROVIDE THESE PRODUCTS O CALIFORNIA SAID THAT THEY WOULD ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO VERIFY THAT THAT PRODUCTS CAME FROM SOURCES THAT MEET THE PROPOSITIONS REQUIREMENTS. AND THAT IN THE PROPOSITIONS REQUIREMENTS BOUGHT SAY THAT ANY SALE. PRODUCT. SO -- THEORETICALLY IF PEOPLE LEFT THE STATE TO BUY NON -- THAT PRODUCTS FOR THEIR OWN USE -- THEY COULD PURCHASE IT FROM ANY ANYONE OUT A STATE AND BRING IT AND FOR THEIR OWN USE BUT NOT PURCHASE. BUT BUT IT REGULATES THE PURCHASE UP PRODUCT BY CALIFORNIA -- RETAILERS I GUESS IS THE POINT THE POINT I'M TRYING TO GET TO IS THAT THIS IS GOING TO INCREASE THE COST FOR EVERYONE -- IN THE STATE AS WELL AS A CD IF A TO ACTUALLY DO THE REGULATION. THIS DATE IT WILL CHO INCREASE COSTS FOR AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT IF IT NEVER CULTURE. TO DO THAT REGULATE. THE INDUSTRY AND MAKE SURE THAT IT'S COMPLYING WITH WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS BUT IT WOULD ALSO INCREASE THE COSTS FOR CONSUMERS -- DICE. THINKING THAT DIE WHO WERE STILL WORKING ON OUR BALLOT CAMPAIGN WHERE GOING TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT AND NOT. GOING BEYOND WHAT WE'VE ALREADY SAID IN THAT AND THEIR TITLE AND SUMMARY AT THIS POINT OKAY [inaudible] OKAY QUESTIONS [inaudible] SO [inaudible] AUTHORED. GET INTO THAT PORTION OF THE CONVERSATION. IT I I'M GONNA MAKE SURE I'M UNDERSTANDING TO THIS WOULD ALLOW CALIFORNIA FOOD IN A BAG. TO LICENSE OUT OF STATE FARMERS XIN.TO SELL PRODUCT WITHIN THE STATE. WE I A IN THE MEASURE DOESN'T SPECIFICALLY SPEAK TO HOW THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE WOULD ENFORCE THE MEASURE WITH REGARDS TO OUT OF STATE FARMERS. BUT IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD NOW THE CULTURE THAT WE HAD WHEN WE CAME UP WITH THIS ESTIMATE OF THEIR COSTS. THEY INDICATED TO US THAT THEY'VE DONE THIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY IN THE PAST AND THAT THEY ARE ESTIMATED THAT THEY WOULD NEED ADDITIONAL STAFF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES. AND POTENTIALLY NEW RESOURCES FOR THEIR BORDER INSPECTION STATIONS. IN ORDER TO ENFORCE THE MEASURE. OKAY IN AND DO YOU HAVE THE NUMBER ON FOR FURTHER ON THE SIGNATURE COUNT ON HOW MANY WERE PAID VERSES ON PAID. ONE THE SIGNATURE GATHERING I I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION AND LOVE KNOW THAT NUMBER. OTHER QUESTIONS YES MISS AG WORKER YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE INFORMATION SO I COUPLE THINGS IS THAT. I'M A SENIOR ESTIMATE OF COSTS ARE OPPORTUNITY COST INCLUDED SUCH AS IF WE HAD BUSINESSES LEAVE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OR STAY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- I'M CONCERNED ABOUT MENTALLY TO THE CONSUMER. BECAUSE IT WILL BE PASSED ON TO THEM SO. FOR INSTANCE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY DATA OR YOU WILL BE PUTTING ANYTHING IN YOUR ANALYSIS IS THE FACT THAT -- WE ARE NOW LOOKING AT ARE WILL USE THE CHICKENS FOR EGGS AT IT FOR THE DISCUSSION. LARGER CAGES. LARGER BARNES TO ACCOMMODATE AMID ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE NOT FACTORED IN THE WHERE. ARE WE AT WE HAVE THE FACTORED ANYWHERE AT ALL FOR THE COST ULTIMATELY TO THE CONSUMER. BECAUSE THIS PARTICULAR CHICKEN MANY OF MY PEOPLE EAT AS THE PRICE GOES UP. YOU KNOW WE WANNA MAKE SURE ONCE FED BUT THE PRICE IS GOING TO GO UP. SO -- I'M JUST INTERESTED IN THAT WAS FACTORED INTO ANY OF YOUR NUMBERS [inaudible] AND WELL WE DID TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT POTENTIALLY. FARMERS IN CALIFORNIA COULD CHOOSE TO REDUCE THEIR THEIR RENO. YEAH I'VE THEIR OPERATIONS IN THIS WOULD HAVE AN EFFECT ON STATE LOCAL AND TAX REVENUES. I'M WITH REGARD TO THE QUESTION YOU'RE ASKING ME ABOUT -- INCREASED COST TO THE CONSUMER AS I SAID BEFORE THIS PANEL IF FAIRLY LIMITED TO SPEAKING TO JUSTIN ALICE'S THAT WE'VE DONE SO FAR. FOR OUR FOR THE TITLE -- BUT THAT MEASURE DOES REQUIRE THAT BOTH OUT OF STATE AND IN STATE. FARMERS COTTON MEET THESE PRODUCTION COSTS SO -- SOMEONE IF YOU WHETHER YOUR BRAIN THAT THE PORK THE ACHES CALM THE VEAL IN FROM OUT OF STATE OR IT'S BEEN PRODUCED HEARING CALIFORNIA. ALL THE FARMERS WOULD HAVE TO MEET THE SAME STANDARDS THROUGH ASKING OTHER STATES TO MEET THE CALIFORNIA STANDARDS. IF THEY WANT TO SELL EITHER IF THOSE FARMERS WANT. TO SELL THEIR PRODUCTS IN CALIFORNIA YES [inaudible] THANK YOU. SELECT. WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT A MAJORITY OF THE VEAL AND THE EXIT COMING TO CALIFORNIA KEY CONSUMER CALIFORNIANS ARE PRODUCED I'M STATE? SO I AM YES WERE ASKING THEM IF THEY WANT TO SELL IN OUR STATE. TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS PROPOSITION IF IT PASSES ON AND MY CONCERN IS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE INCREASED -- AT REQUIREMENTS ON EGGS AND I'VE SEEN. THE DIFFERENCE WHEN I TRAVEL TO OTHER STATES AND THEIR SOMETIMES AS MUCH AS HALF OF THE COST NO QUESTION THAT IT. THAT IT'S IT'S GOOD FOR THE ANIMALS I'M JUST TALKING ABOUT THE ECONOMICS OF IT RIGHT NOW MR MATHIS. BUT I'M JUST. THIS IS GOING TO GO AFTER. FOLKS IN AGRICULTURE WHO WHO ARE RAISING. THESE ANIMALS BUT I MEAN. ON ON A CONSUMER BASIS WHAT'S GONNA STOP. DO YOU KNOW SOMEBODY FROM GOING ONLINE WERE ORDERING A STEAK FROM A MAGAZINE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I MEAN IT'S THE THESE THINGS HAPPEN ON A REGULAR BASIS I MEAN PEOPLE NOWADAYS ARE ORDERING FRESH FOOD OFF A AMAZON. SO MAIN HOUSE FOOD NAG AND WITH THAT WITH THAT INCREASE OF TEN MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET I KNOW BUT WHAT DO YOU FOR SEE THEM BEING ABLE. TO THE ONE THAT I'M GOING TO REGULATETHE INTERNET IN AND WATCH EVERY SINGLE BY AND EVERY. MAIL ORDER. STEEP THAT GOES THROUGH IT I MEAN IT I I DON'T SEE THE PRACTICALITY IN DOING THAT I THINK WE'RE JUST WASTING MONEY TO TO REGULATE. SOME AND THIS CAN BE DONE REGARDLESS. BUT IT ACT TRIP FROM A REGULATION STAFF ON HOW ARE THEY GONNA DO THAT. AND YOU KNOW IT WHEN WE TALK TO THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE THERE ARE ANY THEIR SON A FIGURING OUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO ENFORCE THIS MEASURE AND I THINK. THEY TO WERE PONDERING ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES LIKE THE ONE THAT YOU JUST RAISED AND HOW THEY COULDN'T EFFECTIVELY. ENFORCE. I AGAINST THAT SOME OF THE TYPES OF ISSUES THAT YOU JUST RAISED. ANY LAWS THAT ARE ON THE BOOKS THAT I HAVE TROUBLE WITH ENFORCEMENT SO I DON'T. HARD HARD TO SAY THE SKI BEHIND ANOTHER. ONE WELL THE OTHER ISSUE OBVIOUSLY IS THAT WERE WERE BEING. SUIT RIGHT NOW BY OTHER STATES. ON THIS TICKET A VERY ISSUE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHICH IS CN WE REGULATE THEIR BUSINESSES. ARE THERE BUSINESS PRACTICES THROUGH OUR OWN REGULATORY PROCESS SO OBVIOUSLY THAT'S PROBABLY SOMETHING THE COURT AND HAVE TO DECIDE IN TERMS OF A CONSTITUTIONAL. A ISSUES BUT DOWN. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS. FOR THIS GENTLEMAN IFNOT WE'LL MOVE ON TO OUR SECOND PANEL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR AT OVERVIEW PANEL NUMBER TWO IS CRYSTAL MARLON FROM THE HUMANE SOCIETY OF THE UNITED STATES [inaudible] WELCOME [inaudible] AND THE PHONE. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THINK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY IN FRONT OF THE THE COMMITTEE ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF PREVENT CRUELTY I TO FARM ANIMALS ACT. IN TWO THOUSAND ANY CALIFORNIA VOTERS OVERWHELMINGLY APPROVED PROPOSITION TWO WITH NEARLY 64% OF THE VOTE ESTABLISHING THAT HENS. PIGS AND CAST STATEWIDE MUST BE ABLE TO STAND APPLY TURN AROUND AND EXTEND THEIR LIMBS WITH AN EFFECTIVE DATE OF TWENTY FIFTEEN TWO YEARS LATER AND TWENTY TEN THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE. ENACTED EP FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN TO APPLY PROP TWO STANDARDS TO EXALT STATEWIDE. REGARD THIS WHERE THEY ARE PRODUCED. ALTHOUGH MANY PRODUCERS INVESTED TO CONVERT KEY TREE AFTER THE PASSAGE OF PROP TWO TO PROPERLY BE AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE. OTHERS PUSHED FOR A DISINGENUOUS INTERPRETATION OF THE LAW TO KEEP HANDS IN CAGES. FURTHER MORE THAN A DECADE SINCE THE PASSAGE OF PROPOSITION. TO THE MARKETPLACE AND STATES SUCH AS MASSACHUSETTS HAVE ADOPTED EVEN STRONGER FOOD SAFETY AND ANIMAL WELFARE REQUIREMENTS. THE MEASURE WILL SIMPLY ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA ISN'T LAGGING BEHIND. THE ONLY LEGAL MEANS TO MODIFY PROP TWO IS VIA A BALLOT INITIATIVE WHICH THE PROPOSED PREVENTION TO CRUELTY. TO FARMED ANIMALS ACT PROPERLY DOES. THIS MEASURE WOULD UPGRADE CURRENT ANIMAL CRUELTY AND FOOD SAFETY LAWS TO ENSURE THAT CABS RATES REVEAL. I CLING CHICKENS AND BREEDING PIGS ARE GIVEN MORE SPACE INCLUDING CAGE FREE CONDITIONS. IT WOULD ALSO ENSURE THAT VEAL EGGS AND PORK SOLD IN THE CITY MEET THIS MODEST ANIMAL WELFARE AND FOOD SAFETY REQUIREMENTS. MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIA VOTERS HAVE SIGNED THE PETITION IN ORDER TO QUALIFY THIS MEASURE. THE INITIATIVE IS BACKED BY A LARGE COALITION OF LEADING NATIONAL AND STATE ANIMAL PROTECTION NONPROFITS. FOOD SAFETY AND CONSUMER ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL S HUNDREDS OF THAT. CALIFORNIA VETERINARIANS. KEY EGG PRODUCERS ARE ALSO BACKING THAT'S THE MEASURE OF RECOGNIZING THAT GOOD BUSINESS AND BETTER TREATMENT OF ANIMALS ARE IN ALIGNMENT. SINCE THE PASSAGE OF PROP TWO THREE HUNDRED MAJOR FOOD RETAILERS HAVE COMMITTED TO FEES AND KEY TREE PURCHASING PRACTICES. BUT ITS MOVEMENTS OF 90% OF THE FOOD RETAIL SECTOR DEMONSTRATES OUR IDEAS ARE SOLIDLY IN THE MAINSTREAM AND PRACTICAL FORM. OF FOOD PROCUREMENT AND SALE PERSPECTIVES. WE RECOGNIZE THE TRANSITION TO CAGE FREE CANNOT SUDDENLY HAPPEN AND TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TO THE DATE THAT A LARGE NUMBER OF RETAILERS CHOOSE AS THE DEADLINE FOR THEIR COMMITMENTS. FARMERS NEED TO BUILD NEW HOUSING SYSTEMS YEAR BY YEAR IN ORDER TO CONVERT THE ENTIRE AG INDUSTRY TO CAGE FREE BY THAT DAY. GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS CONVERSION CALLERS THAT S. B. INVESTED. SOME MAJOR FOOD TOO RETAILERS SUCH AS COSTCO COMPASS GROUP AND OTHERS HAVE MADE CAGE FREE PLEDGES THAT ARE MUCH SOONER TO TAKE EFFECT. AND THEY ARE IN NEED OF FARMERS WHO HAVE MADE INVESTMENTS IN KEY TREE SYSTEMS TO FILL THEIR SHELF SPACE. THAT'S WHAT I NEED CALIFORNIA BALLOT INITIATIVE DOES. THIS PROPOSED MEASURE WOULD UPGRADE THE LOBBY TRIGGERING A SHIFT TOWARDS CAGE FREE HOUSING SYSTEMS FOR IDLING HANDS. VEAL CALVES AND BREEDING PACKS THE TRANSITION FOR EGG PRODUCERS WILL HAPPEN OVER A MULTI YEAR AND MULTI STEP PERIOD TO ENSURE AN ORDERLY TRANSITION TO CAGE FREE SYSTEMS. CALIFORNIA HAS ALREADY BEEN A LEADER IN THE PRODUCTION OF CAGE FREE. HOWEVER IN ORDER TO HAVE A THRIVING GROWING INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA THERE HAS TO BE CERTAINTY FOR PRODUCERS. IF THEY ARE IMPLEMENTING NEW PRACTICES WHICH IS THE WAY THE MARKET IS GROWING THEY NEED CERTAINTY THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO SELL THEIR EGGS PORK AND VEAL FROM THE SYSTEMS. SO THEY CAN HAVE A PLAN AND A VAST APPROPRIATELY. IT WILL ALSO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA WILL HAVE A COMPETITIVE EDGE IN SUPPLYING THE ENORMOUS BURGEONING CAGE FREE MARKET. TIME AND TIME AGAIN WE SEE NOT VOTERS LEARN THE TRUTH ABOUT FACTORY FARMING AND ITS STRONG RELATION TO FOOD SAFETY AND THEY ARE READY TO EMBRACE A NEW VISION FOR AGRICULTURE. WHEN THAT INSURANCE OUR OPTICAL VALUES AND PRINCIPLES OUR CURRENT POLLING SHOWS AVAILABILITY FOR CALIFORNIA VOTERS AT THIS MEASURE AT A STAGGERING 72%? OF BOTH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS THESE DAYS IT'S HARD TO FIND ANY ISSUE WITH SUCH A WIDESPREAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. CALIFORNIA HAS LONG BEEN A LEADER IN INNOVATION CREATING CHANGE THAT THE REST OF THE UNITED STATES TRIES TO FOLLOW. PASSAGE OF THIS BALLOT IMAGE INITIATIVE WILL SAN SHOOTS ABOUT RECORD A WIN WITH THIS PROPOSITION ON ELECTION DAY WILL BE GOOD FOR ANIMALS CONSUMERS AND FARMERS TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING. THANK YOU AND I'M LIKE TO DEFER THE REST OF MY TIME TO DR JIM REYNOLDS WHO IS A FARM ANIMAL VETERINARIAN ENDORSER OF THIS MEASURE. A WELCOME THEM THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE ACT. MY NAME IS JIM REYNOLDS I WAS RAISED ON A DAIRY AND SAN DIEGO QUITE AWHILE AGO. I GRADUATED FROM UC DAVIS VERY HIGH SCHOOL IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO AND AND I PRACTICE BOVINE MEDICINE IN SEVERAL AREAS CALIFORNIAN PRIVATE PRACTICE. I COMPLETED A RESIDENCY WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT. THERE WAS CHIEF OF SERVICE FOR DAIRY PRODUCTION MEDICINE FOR UC DAVIS VETERINARY SCHOOL FOR TWELVE YEARS AND CELERY. I AM CURRENTLY A PROFESSOR OF LARGE ANIMAL MEDICINE A WELFARE FOR WESTERN UNIVERSITY. OF HEALTH SERVICES COLLEGE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE IN POMONA CALIFORNIA. HAVE WORKED INTERNATIONALLY. IN LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION HUMANITARIAN AID AND ANIMAL WELFARE. TO CONCERT GOOD MY BACKGROUND CONCLUDES I'VE CHAIR THE AMERICAN VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND THE AMERICAN BOVINE. ASSOCIATION ABOVE I'M PRACTITIONERS WELFARE COMMITTEES. I AM CURRENTLY A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION WELFARE COMMITTEE. AND I AM BOARD CERTIFIED IN THE SPECIALLY AREA OF ANIMAL WELFARE I HAVE. I BELIEVE THAT WHEN WE USE ANIMALS FOR PURPOSES. INCLUDING RAISING THEM FOR FOOD. WE HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE ANIMALS. WE MUST PROVIDE THEM WITH GOOD LIVES PROVIDE BASIC COMMON SENSE PRINCIPLES. PLEASE BASIC NEEDS INCLUDE AMONG OTHER THINGS ENOUGH SPACE SO THEY CAN MOVE. EXERCISE SOCIALIZE AND EXPRESSED TYPICAL BEHAVIORS. THIS WAS SOMETIMES CALLED THE SOCIAL CONTRACT WE HAVE WITH ANIMALS. THE SALIENT PARTS ARE. SOWS HANDS AND VEAL CALVES OUR ALL SENTIMENT INTELLIGENT ANIMALS BUT HAVE EMOTIONS AND FEELINGS. THESE ANIMALS HAVE BEHAVIORAL NEEDS THAT INCLUDE. THE NEED TO SOCIALIZE GROOM EXERCISE AND EXPRESS OTHER SPECIES TYPICAL BEHAVIORS. THE SCIENCE OF ANIMAL WELFARE IS VERY CLEAR. THAT THESE ANIMALS NEED MORE SPACE THAN JUST NATION CREDITS. POULTRY CAGES UNVEIL CRATES ALLOW. ANIMALS COMBINED IN THE SMALL SPACES DEMONSTRATES NARROW TEPES. BOREDOM AND HAVE INCREASED RATES OF METABOLIC AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES. THIS STATION CRATES POULTRY CAGES AND REAL CRATES ARE NOT. THERE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE ANIMALS. BUT THE GAZE OF MANAGEMENT OF THE PRODUCERS. CONFINEMENT OF ANIMALS IN THE SPACES THAT DO NOT ALLOW THEM TO MOVE OR SOCIALIZE IS INHUMANE. THE ACT WILL PROVIDE A COMPROMISE BETWEEN WHAT ANIMALS INVOLVED WANT AND NEED. AND WHAT COMMERCIAL LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION WANTS TO PROVIDE. I THINK WE'LL TAKE QUESTIONS. SAY WE HEARD BOTH THANK YOU -- A COUPLE QUESTIONS SO -- YOU BILL PROBABLY HAD PROPOSITION TWO AND YOU WANNA CAGE FREE HOUSING -- WHY DID YOU NOT RATE PROPS TO TO REQUIRE CAGE FREE HOUSING THEN? SURE -- AS A MEMBER HOW COULD I NOT KNOW -- ON BEHALF OF THE COALITION IN SUPPORT OF OF THE INITIATIVE -- NEAR THIS IS AN INCREMENTAL PROCESS -- DID -- PROP TWO WASN'T IF I THINK THE FIRST IN THE NATION OF ITS KIND -- INSIDE AND IT'S IT'S SORT OF INCREMENTAL IN TERMS OF PHASING IN NOT TRYING TO BE TOO DRASTIC IN TERMS OF THE PRODUCERS COSTS -- SO STEP BY STEP APPROACH -- AND MAKES IT EASIER BILL FOR THE FOR TO HANDLE IT IN THE DISTANCE ON THE MARKET TO JUST AS WELL. SO -- WE REQUIRE FIRE THE FARMERS TO UPGRADE IT MILLIONS AND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. SO WE HAVE THIS NEXT PHASE COMING IN. WHAT'S NOT. HOW CAN WE GUARANTEE YOU NOTHING COME BACK IN A COUPLE YEARS AND REQUIRE MORE REGULATIONS ON OUR FARMERS? SURE WILL UP AS YOU JUST SAID IS PHASED IN. SO IS THIS THE END OF PHASES. OVER YOU HAVE LUIS MEASURES AND AT LEAST FOR ON A HEN CONFINEMENT -- YOU THE ULTIMATE THE AND AND RESULT IS IT ADOPTS INDUSTRY STANDARD -- AS AS THE THE FINAL AYE NOT SIZE YOU REQUIREMENTS FOR FOR POULTRY CAGES SO IT'S WHATEVER'S THE IN THE IN INDUSTRIES -- SORT OF BEST PRACTICE THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THE INITIATIVE REQUIRES [inaudible] SO THAT'S IT DID MOVES OVER TO WHAT WHAT THE POULTRY INDUSTRY IS DETERMINED TO BE DEEP IN THE MOST APPROPRIATE HOUSING STANDARDS THAT'S INITIATIVE. BUT IT'S THE TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN ON UNITED EGG PRODUCERS ANIMAL HAS BEEN TO YOU HUSBANDRY GUIDELINES. I JUST SORT I DON'T SEE THIS GETTING OUT OF CONTROL AND MEANS YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND I'M PAUL FOR MAKING SURE THINGS ARE HUMANE. BUT I ALSO HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE COST TO THEFARMER THE COST TO THE ECONOMY THE COST TO MY CONSUMERS. AND I GOT TO I REALLY WORRY ABOUT MY CONSUMERS IF THERE'S ANYTHING LOT OF MY PEOPLE ARE ON LIMITED. INCOME AND CHICKENS ONE OF THE TOP -- PRODUCTS THAT THEY EAT. AND SO THE EVERYTIME SOMETHING GOES UP REFERENCES STATE CALIFORNIA SO EXPENSIVE YOU KNOW THIS IS JUST ONE OF THEM. AND SURE BY CHRISTOPHER TALK ABOUT COST YES YES SO THE INITIATIVE ONLY COVERS ACTS THAT I SHALL AND LIQUID ADS. AND WOOD IS COMPANIES LIKE MCDONALD'S AND WALMART MAKING THESE CONVERSIONS I REALLY SPECIALIZE IN IN KEEPING PRICES LOW. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF STUDIES DONE AND HEARD TOO HOT CONSUMERS WOULD BE AND THAT RANGES ABOUT ONE TO TWO SAM PER AG. THAT CONSUMERS WOULD WOULD HAVE THE IMPACT OF WHOM I'M THAT SO HARD TO BELIEVE HER NEPHEW IN AND BY. THANKS RECENTLY BUT THEY'VE GONE SKY HIGH. OKAY THANK YOU. WELL IT'S NOT JUST IT'S IT'S IN COMPARISON TO STATES THAT DON'T HAVE THE SAME. REGULATIONS THAT THERE THE DIFFERENCES FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT. MR MATHIS ARM. YEAH I MEAN IT. HOW MANY MORE PHASES YEARS HAVE? BUT AGAIN DOESN'T IT ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS THIS I CAN ONLY BE CHANGED BY THE VOTERS TIME SO YOU KNOW IT THE I UNDERSTAND IT DOESN'T TAKE INTO THAT VOTERS AS AND THAT WON'T BE ENOUGH. THAT SLOWS THE PROCESS ISSUE NUMBER. I'M SORRY YOU SAID YOU HAVE A PLAN TO TO FEES AND SO WHAT IS YOUR ULTIMATE GOAL. BUT WE START WITH HIS YOU WOULD HAVE WROTE THIS AND TO PROP TO YOU WHEN YOU DIDN'T BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO MOVE BACK OR MENTALLY. AND E. E. OF COST INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA THOUGH OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS YOU'VE INCREASE THE COST OF EGGS. WAIT WHICH HAS A NET INCREASE ON OTHER STATE BUDGETS NOT NOT AS FOOD AND AG BUT I MEAN YOU ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF THE YOU KNOW OUR OUR PROGRAMS LIKE WAKING CAL FRESH GIVE ACHES TO FAMILIES WHO ARE IN NEED. WHICH IS THEN ANOTHER INCURRED. ARE BUDGETARY [inaudible] THAT -- CAN YOU KNOW FOR THE STATE WE HAVE TO EAT THAT COST. AND SO I MEAN IF IT IS THE LA O. I I SHOULD ASK THIS QUESTION OF THE LA A A LA OR DO YOU HAVE ANY NUMBERS ON THE INCREASED COSTS FOR THAT THE WAKE PROGRAMS OR CAL FRESH -- IN IN NUMBERS ON HOW MANY FAMILIES ARE GETTING EGGS AND THE INCREASED COST OF THE STATE THERE. AS SOMEONE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE IDON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO BE RIGHT NOW TO SHARE WITH YOU -- I KNOW THAT THEY THAT INCLUDED IN THE MEASURE THERE IS ADD A PROVISION THAT THAT AS I AS I UNDERSTAND IT. THAT WOULD REQUIRE THAT THE MEASURE -- SUPERSEDES THAT THE REQUIREMENTS ON IS IT THIS. THE SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION. I'VE PROGRAM BUT AS FOR HOW MUCH TO TIP ATTENTION THE INCREASED COSTS FOR THE PROGRAMS THAT YOU JUST NAMED I DON'T HAVE AN ESTIMATE. FOR A I ASK THAT BECAUSE IN MY DISTRICT WE YOU KNOW FIFTY SIX FOR SOME OF MY DISTRICT IS ON SOME KIND OF US LEGISLATOR MEDIC CALLERS pAND YOU KNOW THE AVERAGE INCOME IS UNDER THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND HERE. SELL IT IS WE GO TO INCREASE THESE THINGS AND WE'RE HAVING A HARD ENOUGH TIME. ENSURING THAT FAMILIES CAN LITERALLY FEED THEIR FAMILIES -- VERSUS HAVING TO MAKE OTHER CHOICES ON YOU KNOW HOW MUCH GAS TO PUT IN THEIR TANK. AND SO WE YOU KNOW HERE WE ARE WITH WITH ANOTHER PHASE -- THAT THEY COULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BEFORE. ARM. I I JUST HAVE A HARD TIME. SEEN HOW FAMILIES CAN -- DIGEST -- ALL THESE INCREASES. SO A SUMMER MATHIS MAYBE I CAN -- DE UM ELABORATE ON THAT IN IN I THINK IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THERE WAS MUCH MORE DISAGREEMENT TWEEN ANIMAL WELFARE GROUPS AND AND AGRICULTURE. INDUSTRY IN TERMS OF THE PROPER OR YOU KNOW -- THE INDIA CONFINEMENT STANDARDS FOR FOR ANIMALS WE'VE MOVED TO A POINT NOW WHERE IN THE INITIATIVE [inaudible] WE ADOPT. THE UNITED EGG PRODUCERS ANIMAL HUSBANDRY GUIDELINES SO I THINK WE'VE REACHED A POINT IN THAT SORT OF IN THIS PHASE IN A PROCESS THAT ACTUALLY AGREEMENT BETWEEN ANIMAL WELFARE GROUPS. AND PRODUCERS -- OF WHAT THE PROPER STANDARDS ARE I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THAT'S OF BUT THAT'S A GREAT DEVELOPMENT FRANKLY BUT BUT BUT AS AS YOU JUST TESTIFIED. THE MARKETS ARE YOU DOING THIS YOU JUST SAID COSCO'S ALREADY ADOPTING THIS SO OF THE MARKET'S RD DOING IT ON OUR OWN WHAT'S THE NEED FOR A MEASURE. TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S NO OUT LETTERS IN THE MARKET. EXCUSE ME THAT ALL ANIMALS HAVE THE PROPER PROTECTIONS. SO WE'RE MORE CONCERNED BUT THE OTHER THING IS TO SET A DATE. RIGHT I MEAN THAT'S WHAT IT DOES IS IT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE DATE AND I THINK IT SAM. IT SIGNIFICANT THAT THERE'S AGREEMENT. MY CONCERN IN AND WE'LL HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION -- IT'S JUST WHETHER THE DATE WORKS -- I'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO ACTORS ALL OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT FARMS. AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S DISAGREEMENT ABOUT GETTING. TO THIS NEW STANDARD THE QUESTION IS AMORTIZING THE COST OVERTIME AND THEN GETTING ENOUGH. HAVING ENOUGH TIME TO ACTUALLY MOVE THE EQUIPMENT OUT BRING IN NEW AND HAVE IT LINE UP WITH WHEN -- WHEN THAT THEIR HANDS ARE PRODUCING? FROM THE HAND PERSPECTIVE SO -- MINIMUM PORTENT PART THAT I HEAR FROM FARMERS WHO ARE LOOKING TO MAKE THESE INVESTMENTS BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE WRITING'S ON THE WALL. PROP TO LIZ THIRTEEN YOU KNOW YEARS AGO THAT THIS WAS THAT THE IDEA WAS ADOPTED. AND GOING BACK TO WHAT I SAID ABOUT PROVIDING CERTAINTY BEINGS NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ALSO HAVE. YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE MAKING THE RIGHT INVESTMENTS THESE FARMERS AND LOANING MONEY AND THAT THEY'RE LOANING MONEY TO SOMETHING. THAT IS GOING TO BE BOUGHT BY CONSUMERS AND IT IS GOING TO BE THE MAINSTREAM IDEA. SO IT ALSO DOES PROVIDE CERTAINTY. I WANT TO HELP THEM UPGRADE BOB BY CONCERNED CONSUMERS BECAUSE I MEAN THIS IS A VITAL PART OF OUR DIET THIS IS -- IS REASON WHY WAKING CAO FRESH COVER THINGS LIKE EGGS ON THEIR THE PROGRAM SO. THAT ARE GONNA BE FOUGHT BECAUSE TO CONSUMERS WILL REALLY HAVE ANY OTHER CHOICE. BOB ON ON IN ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE UP HERE ON THE DICE BY BE OKAY WITH TO THE INCREASE ADDITIONAL COST TO FARMERS AND HAVING A LOT MORE MONEY TO THEM AND EVERYTHING ELSE AND I'D LIKE TO SEE THEM PROSPER. THE AS IT IS AND I'M I'M MORE CONCERNED ABOUT. YOU KNOW MONEY. FOR THE FAMILIES THAT ARE OUT THERE STRUGGLING AND CALIFORNIA'S OVER REGULATORY SYSTEM AS IT IS. WHO ARE TRYING TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES? AND I JUST DON'T SEE HOW. ONE MORE PHASE. AS YOU ALL PUT AID IS GOING TO HELP FAMILIES AT THE END OF THE DAY. BEAT BECAUSE WE WE HAVE TOO MANY FAMILIES STRUGGLING AS IT IS NOW. AND AS FROM STATE BUDGET TORY SANTORUM YEAH WE JUST PASSED THE LARGEST THE BUDGET IN HISTORY. BUT SHE ONLY PROGRAMS ALREADY OUT OVER LOG. IN YOUR MEASURES GOING TO INCREASE. THE BURDEN ON THE STATE AND IT'S GOING TO INCREASE. MORE REGULATORY MARKUPS AND WHERE ARE YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE STRUGGLING [inaudible] CHAU. AND MEAN IT. HOUSE IS GONNA HELP FAMILIES OUT THERE THAT ARE STRUGGLING DAY ABOUT IT ASSEMBLY MEMBER I THINK COME OUR STUDIES SHOW THAT IT THE COST IS ABOUT ONE TO TWO CENTS PER A. B.. TIED WITH WE SURE THAT'S A GOOD IDEA I DON'T WANT ONE IF THERE WERE A ON TOP A TWELVE CENTS A GALLON INCREASE WILL HAVE OF EVERYTHING ELSE MY FRIEND THAT THIS MEASURE OF THE COVER THOSE OTHER ITEMS I SO WE WON'T TAKE CREDIT OR BLAME FOR THOSE BUT THE COST. IS MINIMAL IN TERMS OF THE IN TERMS OF CLINTON IMPLEMENTING THIS MEASURE. SO MR LIVING YOU HAD A QUESTIONER INCREASE. SURE IT'S THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I THINK YOU ALL FOR PARTICIPATING THIS IS GREAT THAT WE WILL HAVE THESE HEARINGS ON THESE BALLOT INITIATIVES -- I THINK THAT THAT PROP TWO IN TWO THOUSAND CERTAINLY MOVED TO CONVERSATION IT WAS IN PERFECT AND WE'VE WORKS AS THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE IT WORK FOR CALIFORNIA. AND PERHAPS YOU LEARN A LITTLE BIT FROM THAT IN YOUR APPROACH HERE -- BUT I THINK IT IS AS YOU'VE HEARD IN THE CONVERSATION WE'VE HAD THERE ARE A LOT OF ISSUES THAT WE DEAL WITH IN THE LEGISLATURE AND WE TRY -- TO YOU KNOW CONSIDER WHEN MAKING LAWS. AND HERE YOU ARE USING THE INITIATIVE SYSTEM TO INVENT SOMETHING WHEN YOU ACTUALLY COULD WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE. TO PASS LAWS TO GET TO THE SAME EFFECT THAT YOU WANTED WHY WOULD YOU GO AHEAD AND USE THE INITIATIVE SYSTEM. RATHER THAN ACTUALLY BEING AN ADVOCATE. AND WORKING TO PASS LAWS. SURE -- I THINK A MY BILL THE DRESS THAT PROPOSITION -- TWO COVERS THE SAME ANIMALS -- IF IT AGAIN AND AND MORE OFTEN IT IS EASY I THINK YOU -- MENTIONED SOMETHING MEMBERS OF THE FIRST STEP TOM THERE'S NO PROVISION FOR LEGISLATIVE AMENDMENTS THAT WAS THE FIRST UP. YEAH WELL BE BOMBS ARE I DIE I GET SOME -- THERE'S NO PROVISION FOR AMENDMENTS IN THIS INITIATIVE -- BY THE LEGISLATURE -- FRANTIC ACTION SO THAT THERE IS A NEED TO HAVE AN INITIATIVE TO TO MODIFY THE STANDARDS. AND AND SECONDARILY -- HOW MUCH EXTRA MONEY TO YOUR ORGANIZATIONS REYES IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND ARE YOU ANTICIPATING RAISING TO IT AGAIN TEN YEARS LATER? I I DON'T HAVE THOSE NUMBERS HOW MUCH WAS RAISED IN BUT THAT THAT INFORMATION PUBLICLY AVAILABLE -- CAMPAIGN REPORT. ON THE SECTOR SIX WEBSITE AND SINCE. SINCE THE LA WAS UNABLE TO ANSWER HOW HOW MANY OF THE SIGNATURES WERE PAID VERSES ON PAID. SO WE I DON'T HAVE EXACT BREAKDOWN BUT I DO KNOW ANECDOTALLY THAT THIS CAMPAIGN HAD MORE VOLUNTEERS SIGNATURES COLLECTED THAN ANY OTHER MEASURES THAT WILL APPEAR ON THE BALLOT IN NOVEMBER. TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND HOW MUCH MONEY DID YOU GUYS SPEND ON COLLECTING SIGNATURES ARE THAT IS ALL PUBLICLY REPORTED THAT THE SECTOR STATES WEBSITE THAT INFORMATION COULD BE FOUND. SO I GOT WHO LATER YOU GONNA GIVE ME AND OTHER THE CALIFORNIA SECRETARY OF STATE HOUSING INFORMATION ON HIS WEB PAGE YEAH IT'S I CAN ASK SYRIA RIGHT NOW I'M ASKING YOU KNOW I I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBER. RIGHT FROM I WOULD I WOULD DO THE SAME THING I WOULD GO TO THE SECTOR SUSPICION BECAUSE WELL IT'S ALL AVAILABLE FOR THE PUBLIC TO LOOK AT THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. THANKS VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. PANEL NUMBER THREE IS JOHN BIGELOW J. S. WEST EGG PRODUCER. AND BRADLEY MILLER THE CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIANS AGAINST CRYPTIC CAGES AND FRAUD CAMPAIGN WELCOME. A GOOD MORNING AND I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TODAY -- MY NAME IS JOHN BUT AL. AND I WORK FOR A HUNDRED AND NINE YEAR OLD FAMILY FORMA MODESTO CALIFORNIA THAT RAISES CHICKENS AND I'M A THIRD GENERATION CHICKEN FARMER. WHICH MY SEVENTY EIGHT YEAR OLD MOTHER. STILL DOES TODAY SO I AM VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS ISSUE. AND I KNOW IT'S COMING OUT TODAY AND I GOT TO GET BACK TO WORK AND MAKE SOME EGGS SO I'VE GOT MY COMMENTS -- WRITTEN AT SO I SAY WITHIN MY TIMELINE BUT THERE WILL BE SOME PASSION. THIS INITIATIVE IS ANOTHER POORLY WRITTEN AND ILLINOIS VISE ATTACK ON THE AG INDUSTRY ONLY THREE YEARS AFTER COMPLYING WITH THE NATION'S STRICTEST HOUSING STANDARDS FOR CHICKENS PROPOSITION. TWO CALIFORNIA EGG FARMERS JUST SPENT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND THE STATE LOS THE PRODUCTION OF SEVEN MILLION LAYING HANDS. FORCING CONSUMERS TO BUY MORE EXPENSIVE OUT OF STATE AIDS. THE LOCAL FARM TO FORK MOVEMENT TOOK AN ARROW IN THE LATE JANUARY. ONE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN NOT TO MENTION THE JOBS THAT WERE LOST IN THE STATE AND MONEY THAT TRANSFER DIRECTLY INTO THE MIDWEST PIG FARMERS POCKETS. ALREADY LIMPING FROM THE LAST FIGHT. NOW THE SAME BATTLE ONCE AGAIN THIS TIME GUARANTEEING THE DEATH OF EVEN MORE FAMILY FARMS. UNLESS LOCAL FOR FOOD PRODUCED BY CALIFORNIANS FOR CALIFORNIANS ANIMAL WELFARE. SORRY ANIMAL WELFARE AND HEALTH. IS EVERYTHING TO THE CHICKEN FARMER. MOST CONSUMERS HAVE NEVER BEEN ON A FARM. MUCH LESS UNDERSTAND THE SCIENCE OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOR. H. AT YOU S. USES A MOTIONS AND IGNORANCE. TO GET POLICIES LIKE THIS PASS WOULD NEVER THINK ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS THE LOCAL STATE AND NATIONAL ECONOMIES. AND OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE LOCALLY GROWN PRODUCTS THE EGG INDUSTRY HAS BEEN MOVING TOWARDS CAGE FREE PRODUCTION FOR DECADES. MAJOR RETAILERS RESTAURANTS HAVE MADE COMMITMENTS TO CAGE FREE ONLY A EGGS THEY'VE BEEN WORKING DIRECTLY WITH EGG FARMERS. PLANNING SO SUPPLY AND COST TO CONSUMERS WILL BE MANAGEABLE. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FIVE HAS BEEN THE TARGET DATE. AND NOW FOR SOME ARBITRARY REASON THIS NEEDS TO HAPPEN THREE YEARS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. THREE YEARS MAY SEEM INSIGNIFICANT TO MOST PEOPLE BUT THE TIME NECESSARY TO BUILD BARNS IN THIS STATE. WITH ALL THE LAND USE REQUIREMENTS IS ABSOLUTELY DAUNTING [inaudible] SO. ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WILL BE SPENT. WILL BE SENT OUT OF STATE. THE MAJOR PROBLEM HERE. IS THE TIMELINE. A STAFF ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA EGG FARMERS ARE FAMILY FARMERS THAT HAVE FED CALIFORNIANS FOR GENERATIONS. THE ONCE LARGEST A PRODUCING STATE IN THE NATION IS AGAIN BEING SYSTEMATICALLY WHITTLE DOWN THROUGH A BILL DESIGNED INITIATIVES LIKE THIS. CASE THAT HAS ALWAYS STRIVED TO PROVIDE CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS WITH WHOLESOME [inaudible] AFFORDABLE FOOD. ACCELERATED TO TWENTY TWO DATE WILL HURT THE MOST ECONOMICALLY CHALLENGED CALIFORNIA FAMILIES. THE RESPONSIBLE COURSE OF ACTION WOULD BE TO RECOGNIZE WHAT MAJOR RETAILERS AND CONSUMER TRENDS HAVE ALREADY PLANNED. FOR USE A TWO TWENTY FIVE DATE. STOP FORCING MORE ECONOMIC BURDEN ON THE STATE BECAUSE ONE VOCAL GROUP HAS MISINFORMED PEOPLE WHO DO NOT TRULY UNDERSTAND ALL THE ISSUES. HOW MUCH WILL THIS COST? THE LOWEST INCOME CALIFORNIANS HAVE TO BEAR THE BURDEN ONCE AGAIN BEFORE WE SEE THE REAL. PROBLEM HERE. OKAY IN A PERFECT WORLD WE WOULD ALL LIVE ON SMALL FARMS AND PRODUCE OUR OWN FOOD. FINISH OF A NEGATIVE LIKE THIS WOULD NEVER BE CONSIDERED.% THE REALITY IS MUCH DIFFERENT. FORTY MILLION HUNGRY CALIFORNIANS DEPEND ON FAMILY FARMS AND EXPECT VALUE FOR THEIR HARD EARNED DOLLAR. THIS INITIATIVE WILL INCREASE THE COST OF FOOD. ACOSTA AGRICULTURAL ENFORCEMENT. JOBS WILL BE LOST OR MOVED TO OTHER STATES TAX REVENUE WILL BE LOST AND SO WILL LOCAL FARMERS. H. ISSUE S. AND OUR ALLIES WROTE. PROP. TWO CALIFORNIA FARMERS HAVE SPENT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO COMPLY AND SEVERAL MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR TO ENFORCE. AND WHAT IS THE RESULT. HIGHER PRICES FOR POOR CALIFORNIANS. LET'S CALIFORNIA GROWN EGGS EXPENSIVE LAWSUITS. AND NOW THEY'RE BACK. WE OPPOSE ENCOURAGE YOU ALL TO OPPOSE AND FIND A REASONABLE ALTERNATIVE [inaudible] THANK YOU -- MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS -- THANKS FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. MY NAME IS BRADLEY MILLER I'M A SPOKESPERSON FOR CALIFORNIANS AGAINST CRUELTY CAGES AND FRAUD. A WE HAVE ARE THE BALLOT COMMITTEE THAT WILL BE PRIMARILY -- CHARGED WITH -- OPPOSING THIS INITIATIVE -- WHICH WE REFER TO AS THE ROTTEN EGG INITIATIVE WE WILL HEAD UP TO THE NO ONE PROPOSITION WHATEVER. IT AND NUMBER IT WINDS UP GETTING -- I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THEY'RE REALLY. CLOSER TO THREE SIDES OF THIS ISSUE. WE COULD SAY THERE'S TWO SIDES WITH THERE'S ACTUALLY THREE SITES -- THERE'S THE AGES U. S. POSITION. THAT BELIEVES THAT -- WHAT THEY SAID ABOUT PROPOSITION TWO SHOULD BE COMPLETELY IGNORED? THAT CALIFORNIA SHOULD NOT BE CAGE FREE IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN BUT RATHER WE SHOULD EXPLICITLY KEEP CAGES LEGAL IN THE STATE. FOR A CERTAIN NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL YEARS. AGES YOU S. BELIEVES THAT THE GUIDELINES OF UNITED EGG PRODUCERS SHOULD BE INSERTED INTO CALIFORNIA STATE LAW. THE EGG INDUSTRY AGREES WITH THEM ON THOSE PRIMARY POINTS. WE DISAGREE WITH BOTH THE EGG INDUSTRY AND H. AS YOU S. ON THOSE POINTS. THE DISCREPANCY SEEMS TO BE ALMOST NONEXISTENT. THE REASON WHY NOW IN IN THEIR PRESENTATION THEY METICULOUSLY AVOIDED. SAYING ANYTHING SPECIFICALLY SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE CONTENT OF THE INITIATIVE THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO CREATE A STATE LAW. THEY WERE ASKED VERY DIRECT QUESTIONS AND I'M NOT GOING FROM PREPARED STATEMENTS HERE I'M GOING TO TRY AND FILL IN SOME OF THE GAPS THAT THEY DELIBERATELY LEFT OPEN. SENATOR YOU ASKED -- IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER U. S. -- FOR WAS THIS TRULY A VOLUNTEER BASED EFFORT -- IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR RHETORIC THIS WAS A GREAT IS VOLUNTEER EFFORT THAT THEY SURPASSED ALL THEIR EXPECTATIONS. THROUGHOUT THEIR CAMPAIGN THERE WERE VOLUNTEERS LEAVING IN DROVES AS THEY FOUND OUT WHAT THIS COULD THE CONTENT OF THIS MEASURE DID. THEY THEMSELVES ADMITTED ALL ALONG THE LINE THAT THEY WERE WELL BEHIND IT THEIR SIGNATURE GATHERING CAMPAIGN THAT THEY HAD INTENDED TO DO THIS FOR VOLUNTEERS. TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITIES THE NUMBERS THAT WE HAVE BASED ON THE NUMBERS PUBLISHED BY THE PROPONENTS THEMSELVES. IT APPEARS THAT THERE WERE AS THEY SAID THEY DID SAY ONE THING CORRECTLY. THAT THERE WERE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND NAMES GATHERED [inaudible] APPARENTLY. ONLY A HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR APPROXIMATELY. THOUSAND WERE GATHERED BY VOLUNTEERS THE REMAINDER. WERE FROM PAID SIGNATURE GATHERERS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF WHICH WERE PAYING A BOUNTY PER SIGNATURE. SO. WHAT TROUBLES US IS NOT SIMPLY THAT THEY WERE PAYING FOR THE SIGNATURES ISN'T THE WORD MISLEADING PEOPLE WHILE THEY WERE GATHERING THOSE SIGNATURES? THIS IS A ONE OF THEIR KEY PIECES OF CAMPAIGN MATERIAL RIGHT HERE AND AS YOU CAN SEE IT SAYS. VOTE YES TO PREVENT CRUELTY IN CALIFORNIA. PREVENT CRUELTY IN CALIFORNIA. AND HERE YOU CAN SEE A PICTURE OF A VEAL CRATE AND THE CALF INTO VEAL CRATE. YOU COULD SEE A PICTURE OF A PAGAN AGES STATION CRAIG. YOU CAN SEE THE OF THE REALLY COMPELLING PHOTOS. THAT JUST SO HAPPENED TO BE TAKEN OUT OF STATE. MANY YEARS AGO WERE THE SAME IMAGES THAT THEY USEWHILE PROMOTING PROPOSITION. TWO AND NONE OF THESE PRACTICES EXIST IN OUR STATE. THEIR WORD VEAL CRATES IN CALIFORNIA AT THE TIME OF PROP. TWO THERE ARE NO WE JUST STATION CRATES IN CALIFORNIA NOW AND HAVEN'T BEEN FOR YEARS BUT THEY HAVE GOTTEN PEOPLE TO SIGN THAT PETITION BASED ON THE CLAIM THAT THEY WILL BE PREVENTING THESE PRACTICES. IN CALIFORNIA. THEY WERE IVEN A DIRECT QUESTION AS TO WHY PROPOSITION TWO IF IF IT WAS TO BAN CAGES. WHY DIDN'T IT SAY THIS BANDS CAGES? AND THAT'S THE KEY QUESTION AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY. IT'S NOT LIKE WELL WAY BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT OO IN THOSE DAYS WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT IF YOU WANNA BAN CAGES YOU HAVE TO SAY IN THE TEXT OF THE LEGISLATION. CAGES. THEY WE KNEW IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT IF YOU WANNA GIVE A HAND TWO HUNDRED SIXTEEN SQUARE INCHES OR MORE OF CAGE SPACE OR LIVING SPACE THAT YOU. PUT THAT INTO THE LEGISLATION YOU PUT THAT INTO THE INITIATIVE. THEY MADE THE CONSCIOUS CHOICE NOT TO DO THAT THEY MADE THE CONSCIOUS CHOICE OF PUTTING IN VERY VAGUE LANGUAGE. SO THEY DEPENDING ON WHAT AUDIENCE THEY WERE. SELLINGTHIS TO DATE COULD CRAFT THEIR ARGUMENT ACCORDINGLY YOU DON'T WANT CAGES WELL THIS DOESN'T SAY CAGES YOU WANT A PET CAGE AS WELL THIS IS A DE FACTO BAN ON CAGES. CALIFORNIA VOTERS WENT TO THE POLLS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND OVERWHELMINGLY VOTED FOR SOMETHING THAT THEY WERE TOLD. BY BOTH SIDES OF THE ISSUE BY H. AS U. S. AND BY THE INDUSTRY ITSELF THAT IF THIS MEASURE PASSES. CAGES WOULD BE BANNED BY TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN AND THEY WOULD BE GETTING NO LESS A TWO HUNDRED SQUARE INCHES HER HAND. NO AES U. S. IS COME HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THE EGG INDUSTRIES. DISINGENUOUS MISINTERPRETATION OF PROPOSITION. TWO WE ARE ONE OF THE BOTH FERVENT ADVERSARIES OF THE AG INDUSTRY. UNLIKE H. AS U. S. WE HAVE NOT ENDORSED THIS GENTLEMAN'S FACILITY. WE DID NOT HOLD THIS GENTLEMAN'S FACILITY UP AS A MODEL FOR THE NATION LIKE H. AS U. S. DID. NOW THEY'RE NOT DOING THAT TODAY BECAUSE THEY'RE FLIP FLOPPING BACK AND FORTH DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES. BUT WE'VE BEEN CONSISTENT IN SAYING THAT IT'S THE VOTER INTENT THAT MATTERS HERE. AND THERE'S NO DEBATE THAT THE VOTER INTENT WAS THAT THERE TO BE A DEADLINE TO TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN THE DISINGENUOUS MISINTERPRETED HER PETITION REINTERPRETATION. IS FOR THE SPONSORS OF PROP. TWO COULD NOT OWN UP TO THEIR MISTAKE. A ASSEMBLYMAN LEVINE ASKS WHY CAN'T WE SETTLE THIS LEGISLATIVELY. THE ANSWER IS THEY'RE NOT THE DIFFERENCE ISN'T SIMPLY THAT THEY WILL WANT TO KEEP THEM IN CAGES TWENTY FOUR MONTHS LONGER THAN AGES U. S. WANTS TO KEEP THEM IN CAGES IT'S NOT SIMPLY THAT THEY WANT TO MEAN CAGES FOR NINE YEARS AFTER PROPOSITION TWO WAS SUPPOSED TO GO. INTO EFFECT AN AGE ISSUE WHAT'S IN YEARS AFTER THAT. WITH THE LEGISLATION IT BECOMES CLEAR. IF. IF IF THEY HAD BEEN CORRECT ABOUT. WHAT PROPOSITION TWO SAID WE WOULD NOT BE HERE TODAY? IF THEY WERE TELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT THEIR PRESENT ROTTEN INITIATIVE. WE WOULD BE AMONG THE FIRST TO SUPPORT IT. pBELIEVE THAT THIS AND VOTERS HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN CALIFORNIANS HAVE ALREADY FOLKS SPOKANE. AND WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA'S BALLOT MEASURE SYSTEM. SHOULD BE EXPLOITED [inaudible] BY. ANIMAL THEMED CORPORATIONS FROM THE EAST COAST THAT EVERY SEVERAL YEARS OR SO FLYING INTO CALIFORNIA. AND TELL CALIFORNIANS HOW WE SHOULD REGULATE AT FARM ANIMALS NOTIN OUR STATE ONLY IN OUR STATE. BUT IN OTHER STATES. WE BASICALLY HAVE PEOPLE FROM MARILYN. FLYING TO CALIFORNIA TO TELL CALIFORNIA'S CALIFORNIANS THAT THEY SHOULD REGULATE IOWA. THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON HERE AND THE REASON WHY THEY ARE NOT ON BOARD WITH THE A. B. THIRTY TWENTY ONE WHICH WE'D. OPENLY OPPOSE WE'RE OPPOSED TO IT WE THINK IT SHOULD BE CAGE FREE NOW WE THINK THAT ONE SQUARE FOOT PER HAND IS INSANELY COOL. BUT THE REASON WHY THEY ARE DOING IT IS BECAUSE THE LEGISLATION IS CLEAR. THE LEGISLATION WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET IT SAYS HERE'S CAGES THEIR LEGAL UNTIL THIS DY. CARES MUCH HOW MUCH SPACE YOU'RE GOING TO GET. THE REASON WHY EACH ISSUE S. FEELS UNCOMFORTABLE. UNDER. THE ENDORSING THAT. EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE ENDORSING THE EXACT SAME POLICY THE EXACT SAME KATE SIZE. IN THE INITIATIVE. IS THAT ANY INITIATIVE IT'S BURIED IN A BUNCH OF OTHER GARBAGE. SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO ADMIT THAT PROP TWO FAILED. THEY CAN ACTED TODAY. AT THIS GENTLEMAN HERE SAID WELL THE REASON WHY WE DIDN'T -- SAY CAGE FREE EXPLICITLY IMPROPER TO ONLY EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF PROPAGANDA SAID IT THE REASON WHY WE DIDN'T SAY IT IS BECAUSE WE WANTED TO PHASE IT IN. THAT IS COMPLETE DOUBLE TALK. THAT'S COMPLETE DOUBLE TALK. PROPOSITION TWO WAS A PHASE IN. PROPOSITION TO A TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT SAID WE'RE GOING TO GIVE THE EGG INDUSTRY SIX YEARS. TO PROVIDE MORE ADVOCATES SPACE AND EVENTUALLY IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN BE CAGE FREE. THAT IS A PHASE IN THAT IS A PHASE IN THAT MANY ANIMAL ORGANIZATIONS WERE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH. THEY THOUGHT SIX YEARS WAS TOO LONG WE THOUGHT SIX YEARS WAS TOO LONG. HOWEVER WHEN SIX YEARS CAME ALONG. LO AND BEHOLD THE HANDS ARE STILL IN CAGES. H. AS YOU S. WAS TOLD PRIOR TO SUBMITTING THEIR BAD THERE BUT THEIR BALLOT MEASURE LANGUAGE THAT EXACTLY THIS WAS GOING TO TAKE PLACE. BUT THEY SPEND THE LAST TEN YEARS. RAISING MONEY. AND MAKING HEROES OUT OF THERE NOW. DISGRACED FORMER SEE EGO WHO IS NOT HERE TO ANSWER VICTIM DO REAL QUESTIONS. CALIFORNIANS HAVE ABOUT THE FRAUD THAT IS TAKING PLACE HERE. HE'S NO LONGER IN THE PICTURE. SO WE'VE GOT HAT THE NEW REGIME COMING IN TRYING TO PICK UP THE PIECES. BUT THE OTHER THING THAT I WANT TO TOUCH ON IS THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE COSTS. THEY HAVEN'T YET FACTORED IN THE COST [inaudible] SENDING THIS PLAYING IN COURT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIANS ALREADY SPENT. A TRUCKLOAD OF MONEY -- IS. DEFENDING THE LAWS THAT ARE ON THE BOOKS [inaudible] THIS IS I HAM FISTED OVER REACH. THAT IS ALREADY CAUSING TREMENDOUS BLOW BACK BOTH IN CONGRESS. AND IN THE COURTS. AND IN ALL LIKELIHOOD. NONE OF THESE PROVISIONS FOR THOSE CONCERNED ABOUT THE ROOM THE RISING COSTS OF PORK DON'T WORRY. BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THIS IS GOING TO BE RENDERED NULL AND VOID. IT'S GONNA COME OFF AFTER A LOT OF COSTS. IT'S GOING TO CUT BY AFTER MANY MILLIONS OF TAX DOLLARS IT'S GOING TO COME AFTER A DOLLARS FROM THE INDUSTRY THAT COULD HAVE BEEN USED TO IMPROVE CONDITIONS IT'S GONNA COME FROM MONEY FROM THE HUMANE COMMUNITY. THAT COULD BE USING THAT MONEY TO ACTUALLY HELP ANIMALS. IF EACH ISSUE S. REALLY KICK ALL OF THE OTHER ARGUMENT AGAINST THE LEGISLATION THAT TEACHERS U. S. WILL SAY IS THAT WELL THE LEGISLATION. DOESN'T DO ANYTHING TO PROTECT THOSE POOR CAPS IN CRATES WHO CAN'T TURN AROUND. IF H. AS U. S. CARED ABOUT CAPS IN CRATES. WHO CAN'T TURN AROUND THEY NEED NOT GO NO FURTHER? IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE COULD A CALF FARMS IN CALIFORNIA WEIRD CAPS ARE TETHERED IN CRATES. VERY SIMILAR TO VEAL CRATES WHERE THEY ARE UNABLE TO TURN AROUND. EIGHT YEARS YOU S. HEADS EXPLICITLY SAID NO THEY REFUSE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT. CALIFORNIA ANIMALS. INSTEAD THEY'RE SAYING. WE'RE GOING TO LET THE CAPS IN CALIFORNIA SCHEME CRATES BUT WE WANT TO PASS AN INITIATIVE THAT'S GOING TO TELL. PENNSYLVANIA VEAL PRODUCERS THAT YOU SHOULDN'T KEEP THEM IN CRATES THERE OKAY HERE FOR CALIFORNIA BUT WE'RE GOING TO REGULATE YOU IN WISCONSIN. AND THAT'S ABSURD. THAT'S ABSOLUTELY ABSURD IT'S DISINGENUOUS THEY KNOW THAT IS IT ISN'T GOING TO FLY. AND THE PROBLEM HERE IS NOT SIMPLY THAT IT'S GOING TO BE RENDERED NULL AND VOID. THE PROBLEM IS THE DAMAGE THAT IT'S GOING TO HAVE ON A WIDE ARRAY OF OTHER CONSUMER. ANIMAL. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION LAWS BECAUSE WHEN THE COURTS AND CONGRESS COME BACK AND WE GOT THIS THING THEY'RE NOT GOING TO USE A SCALPEL. THEY'RE GOING TO USE A CANNON. AND THAT CAN IN IS GOING TO DESTROY A LOT OF LEGISLATION THAT ALL OF US HAVE WORKED ON OVER THE YEARS. IT'S GOING TO DESTROY LEGISLATION THAT FRANKLY IS PROTECTING THE CALIFORNIA EGG PRODUCERS IN SOME WAY IN IN MANY WAYS ALL OF THAT'S GOING TO BE RENDERED NULL AND VOID. BECAUSE THEY ARE SO CONCERNED. WE HAVE LOADING THIS UP WITH DISTRACTIONS. THIS IS A PUBLICITY STUNT IN SEARCH OF A LAWSUIT. AND FOR THEM THEY'RE LOOKING FOR THE QUICK IMMEDIATE GRATIFICATION THEY FEEL LIKE ANYTHING THAT HAS THE WORD FARM ANIMAL AND PROTECT. IF IT HAS THOSE WORDS AND YOU PUT IT ON THE BALLOT IT'S GOING TO PASS. AND PERHAPS THEY'RE RIGHT. BUT THIS TIME AROUND. IT'S GONNA FACE MAJOR OPPOSITION. I DON'T SEE THE MAJOR OPPOSITION COMING FROM. WISCONSIN PORK PRODUCERS ARE OR VIA PORTS PRODUCERS. IT'S A HUMANE FARMING ASSOCIATION. ITS FRIENDS OF ANIMALS. ITS PEOPLE FOR THE ETHICAL TREATMENT OF ANIMALS IT SHOWING ANIMALS RESPECT AND KINDNESS ITS ACTION FOR ANIMALS IT'S OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF RANK AND FILE ANIMAL ACTIVE ADVOCATES THAT ARE APPALLED BY THIS RUN NAY INITIATIVE. AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE WAGING THIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER MILLER ANY QUESTIONS THIS PANEL DRESSES MATHIS -- PERVERSE TO ONE EIGHT JOHN FOR TAKING THE TIME I GOT TO RESPECT THE MAN THAT'S GOT A LITTLE DUST ON HIS BOOTS. SO WHO'S ACTUALLY DOING IT -- MISTER MILLER A I THINK YOUR POINTS ARE SPOT ON THE AYE AYE SAID ON A LEGISLATIVE BOARD DEALING WITH -- INTERSTATE AND FOR FOR AGRICULTURAL. ISSUES IN THE THE IDEA OF CALIFORNIA MANDATING ANOTHER STATE -- AND MOST OTHER STATES MAN. AND WOMEN AND OTHER STATES WOULD FIND PREPOSTEROUS. AND I THINK YOU'RE SPOT ON TO SAY THAT WE'RE GONNA SPEND THE MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON YET ANOTHER LAWSUIT CALIFORNIA FIGHTING. PALM WHICH GOES INTO MY FATHER CONCERN -- I MENTIONED EARLIER. IS IN THE IN AND WHAT'S NOT AND THIS IS YOU KNOW WE WE TALK ABOUT LAND USE. AND THERE'S NOTHING IN THE INITIATIVE PRESCRIBE BEING A FASTER <u>&lt;c.green&gt; I OUR PROCESS.&lt;/c&gt;</u> TO CHANGE THE THE THE CAGE SIZE HER A SEQUEL EXEMPTION AND HER ANYTHING ALONG THOSE LINES -- AND QUITE FRANKLY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TAKES OVER TWELVE YEARS TO BUILD SUPER WALMART -- SO WE HAVE SOME ISSUES HERE SO THEY THANK YOU JOHN THE FOR INTERNET. QUESTION ON THERE WAS CONCERNED AFTER AWHILE FONG BUT THE UNIT INTRODUCTION OF PROPOSITION TWO THAT SOME OF THE ON EGG PRODUCING BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA WOULD LEAVE THE STATE. ARE THERE ANY ESTIMATES OF AS TO WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE INDUSTRY OR THE NUMBER OF FARMS ACTUALLY LEFT THE STATE A NOTE THAT WAS SAID EARLIER THAT. WE LOST ABOUT A MILLION EGG LAYING HENS QUITSCLOSER TO SEVEN MILLION AND BUSINESSES ARE ONLY A FEW SMALL ACTUALLY CLOSE WHAT ENDED UP HAPPENING WAS THE INDUSTRY ACTUALLY SHRUNK. WE REDUCE START DENSITY BE THE NUMBER OF HANDS WE WOULD HAVE BEEN A BARN. AND WITHOUT WE ALSO LOST THAT'S THE SADDEST THING THAT HAPPENED. THAT WE HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT THAT PERCENTAGES IS IT 20% TWENTY ROUGHLY ROUGHLY 19% THANK. OF THE QUESTIONS. BERMAN AT THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING HERE TODAY APPRECIATE THAT I'M HEAR TESTIMONY AND I'M. AS AS I SAID AT THE BEGINNING OF THE HEARING -- OF WE DON'T TAKE ANY ACTION AT THIS IS JUST AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING BUT YOUR YOUR DATE IT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT I THINK IT HITS RIGHT ON THE ISSUES WERE CONCERNED ABOUT WHICH IS ON THE IMPACT ON ON OUR FARMING INDUSTRY AS WELL AS THE IMPACT ON I THINK I THINK. WE ALL WANT TO GO IN THERE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION -- BUT WE'VE GOT TO HAVE TIME TO BE ABLE TO MAKE IT HAPPEN AND ULTIMATELY IT'S IT'S OUR BY THE PUBLIC THAT PAYS THE PRICE IT'S OUR INDUSTRY GOING SO THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE CRESCENTA VERY MUCH -- THAT THIS -- WE BRING IT AYE ONTO OUR PUBLIC COMMENT PORTION OF THE OF THE HEARING AND WE ONLY HAVE ONE INDIVIDUAL THAT SIGNED UP SO IF YOU WANTED TO SIGN UP THE NEED TO SIGN UP WITH THE WITH THE SERGEANT -- ASKING TO DO THAT A ERICA SANGHA FROM THE CALIFORNIA PURPORT PRODUCERS ASSOCIATION WELCOME AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. ARE WE ON YES ERICA SANKO WITH THE CALIFORNIA PORK PRODUCERS ASSOCIATION APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY JUST TO PROVIDE SOME SHORT COMMENTS. WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE INITIATIVE IN ITS ENTIRETY WE DO BELIEVE THAT THOSE MAKING DECISIONS REGARDING ANIMAL CARE AND PRODUCTION PRACTICES SHOULD BE MADE BY THOSE WHO HAVE THE EXPERTISE AND KNOWLEDGE. ARE FARMERS OR PRODUCERS NOT OUT OF STATE ANIMAL ACTIVIST GROUPS WITH A CERTAIN HIDDEN AGENDA. THERE'S ACTUALLY NO SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS INITIATIVE AND THERE'S NO BENEFIT TO IT FOR CALIFORNIA OR ITS CITIZENS IT WILL INCREASE FOOD PRICES WITHOUT A DOUBT. THE MAJORITY OF PORK PRODUCTS THAT ARE IMPORTED INTO CALIFORNIA WHERE THE MAJORITY OF PORK PRODUCTS SOLD IN CALIFORNIA ARE IMPORTED FROM STATES WHERE PRODUCERS DO NOT HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THIS LEGISLATION. IOWA ILLINOIS AND A VARIETY OF OTHER STATES. AS A RESULT AS WE KNOW AND HAS BEEN DISCUSSED ALREADY CHANGES IN PRODUCTION PRACTICES COME AT A SIGNIFICANT COST AND THOSE WILL BE PASSED ON DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS. THROUGH HIGHER RETAIL PRICES LOW INCOME IN LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING WITH HIGHER LIVING COSTS IN CALIFORNIA. THE ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS VERY QUICKLY THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA STUDY IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN HAS SHOWN THAT RETAIL EGG PRICES HERE IN CALIFORNIA SINCE THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN LAW HAVE INCREASED SEVENTY DOLLARS PER HOUSEHOLD. A CORNELL STUDY. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND AGAIN IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN HAS NOTED THAT FOR RETAIL PORT PURCHASES CONSUMER SPEND TWO POINT TWO MORE PER CAPITA IN THEIR EXPENDITURES ON PORK. SO IF YOU DO THE MATH THAT'S OVER A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DOLLARS MORE PER HOUSEHOLD WILL BE SPENDING ON PORK IF THIS INITIATIVE PASSES. IF IT IS A TAXPAYER FUNDED PROGRAM SUCH AS WHERE OR SNAP OR ANY INSTITUTIONAL FUNDING THOSE COSTS WILL ALSO. TRANSPIREIN THAT SO TO SAY THERE ARE NOT ANY DIRECT IMPACTS ON COST TO CONSUMERS IS INCORRECT THERE WILL BE AND THAT IS THE ISSUE. AND FINALLY I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT WE DO BELIEVE THE CALIFORNIA PORK PRODUCERS DO BELIEVE THAT WE WOULD HAVE SEEN INCREASES AND GROWTH IN OUR INDUSTRY IF IT WERE NOT FOR THESE TYPE OF POLICIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE. GOING ONCE GOING TWICE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE TODAY REALLY APPRECIATE -- NEAR UP PARTICIPATION FOR ALL OF YOU WHO TESTIFIED THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF DOT CONCLUDES OUR INFORMATIONAL HEARING AND WE WILL -- TURN THOUGH MIKE OVER -- TO AT SENATOR GALGIANI BECAUSE SHE HAS A HEARING THAT SAID FOLLOW SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
