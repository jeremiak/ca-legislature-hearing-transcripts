RIGHT NOW THANK YOU AMERICA THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FOUR WHICH BRINGS DISCLOSURE AND TRANSPARENCY TO THE CREDIT REPAIR INDUSTRY I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS MEASURE AND BY ACCEPTING THE PROPOSED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS UNDER CURRENT LAW DISCLOSURES AND DESCRIPTIONS OF SERVICES TO BE RENDERED BY A CREDIT REPAIR ORGANIZATION ARE INSUFFICIENT FOR THE MODERN MARKET PLACE. UNSCRUPULOUS CREDIT SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS- OR CSOS ARE PRAYING I CALIFORNIANS ARE BY CHARGING EXORBITANT FEES FOR LITTLE OR NO IMPROVEMENT TO THEIR CREDIT SCORES THESE CSOS KEEP CONSUMERS IN THE DARK ABOUT WHAT CREDIT REPAIR WORK THEY'RE DOING AND CONSUMER CONSUMERS PAY CONTINUES MONTHLY FEE UNTIL THEY PROACTIVELY COUNCIL ONLY TO DISCOVER THEY WILL NOT BE REFUNDED FOR PAST PAYMENTS THE PREDATORY SCSO BUSINESS MODEL IS TO SEND BASELESS TEMPLATES. DISPUTE LETTERS TO ALL CREDITORS ON CONSUMERS CREDIT REPORTS WITHOUT CONSUMERS KNOWLEDGE THESE FRIVOLOUS DISPUTES DO NOT ACTUALLY REPAIR THE CREDIT SCORES OF CALIFORNIANS BECAUSE CREDITORS AND DEBT COLLECTORS VALIDATE THE REPORTED ITEMS IN ACCORDANCE TO FEDERAL LAW YET CONSUMERS CONTINUE TO PAY THE CSOS AND THE CSOS REPEATEDLY SOME THE SAME ROBO LETTERS EACH MONTH UNDER THE GUISE OF PROVIDING CUSTOMIZED CREDIT REPAIR SERVICES AB TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FOUR WAS INTRODUCED TO PUT AN END TO A PIECE OF CSO BEHAVIOR. I TRANSPARENCY FOR CONSUMERS AND CREATE ETHICAL STANDARDS TO CONDUCT OF FOR CALIFORNIA CSO INDUSTRY TOO MANY CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA ARE PURCHASING AND OPAQUE SERVICE WITHOUT TRULY UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACT OR LACK THERE OF THAT THE SERVICE WILL HAVE ON THEIR CREDIT SCORES HERE TODAY WITH ME IS CINDY YAKIN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COLLECTORS AND ALSO MARTIN LEE LYNCH PRESIDENT OF THE FINANCIAL COUNSELING.

AB TWO FOUR TWO FOUR SPONSORED BY THE C. A. C. AS A DIRECT RESULT OF CONSUMER PROTECTION ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY OUR MEMBERS THE COMMUNICATION WITH CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. THIS BILL AMENDS THE CREDIT SERVICES ACT WHICH WAS ENACTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR. TO ADDRESSTHE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CREDIT SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS OR C. S. AS IN CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. THIS BILL UPDATES THE AXE READ REQUIRES ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES AND FOSTERS TRANSPARENCY BETWEEN I SEE FIRSTHAND HOW UNSCRUPULOUS CSOS HAVE ADOPTED A BUSINESS MODEL THAT IS SINGULARLY FOCUSED ON SENDING FRIVOLOUS REPETITIVE LETTERS DISPUTING COUNTS. THESE FOR PROFIT CSOS PRANK CONSUMERS THAT ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING FINANCIALLY BY CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATING THEM TO PAY MONTHLY FEES FOR CREDIT REPAIR WHEN THEY COULD DO IT THEMSELVES OR OBTAIN FREE SERVICES. CONSUMERS EXPRESSED ANGER THAT THEY HAVE BEEN MISLED BY THE CSO FOR PAYING FOR SERVICES WHEN THE CREDIT SCORE DOES NOT INCREASE. SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL REQUIRES A CSO TO INCLUDE IN ITS AGREEMENTS WITH THE CONSUMER. A LIST OF INFORMATION THAT THE CSO WILL SEEK TO DELETE OR MODIFY DISCLOSE THE ANTICIPATED PAYMENT REQUIRED FOR THE CONSUMER FOR SERVICES. PROVIDE CONSUMERS WITH A MONTHLY STATEMENT OUTLINING SERVICES PERFORMS IDENTIFIED THE CSO. AS THE SENDER. OF ANY WRITTEN COMMUNICATION SENT ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER TO SPECIFY PARTIES. AND ALSO TO REGISTER WITH THE FBI AND RE REGISTER ANNUALLY. THIS BILL REQUIRES DEBT COLLECTORS INSTEAD BUYERS TO RESPOND TO DISPUTES FROM AND COMMUNICATE WITH THE CSOS ON BEHALF OF CONSUMERS. THE FAILURE TO RESPOND AND COMMUNICATE WILL EXPOSE DEBT COLLECTORS AND THAT BUYERS POTENTIAL LIABILITY. LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL HAS ISSUED AN OPINION STATING THAT. THAT THE MANDATE TO RESPOND TO AND COMMUNICATE WITH CSS IS NOT PREEMPTED BY FEDERAL LAW. ACTUALLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY ON AB TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FOUR THANK YOU.

THANK YOU AND THANK YOU AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY THIS AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MARTIN LYNCH BY SERVICE PRESIDENT OF FINANCIAL COMPANY ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA. YEAH YOUR AREAS THE NATIONAL INDUSTRY TRADE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING TWENTY SIX BOB PROSPECTING FOR CREDIT COUNSELING AGENCIES MOST OF WHICH PROVIDE A VARIETY OF LOW COST SERVICES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THE FTA STRONGLY SUPPORT THE ADOPTION OF AB. TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FOUR FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS. THE BILL LIMITS CUT REPAIR FOR TOUCH A HUNDRED NINETY DAYS AND PROHIBITS FUNDS. COMPANIES FROM REPEATEDLY CHALLENGING THE SAME ACCOUNTS AND OVER. THE BILL PROHIBITS THE CHALLENGING PART REPORT ENTRIES THAT THE CONSUMER AND THE COVERAGE THEIR COMPANY SHOULD RECOGNIZE ARE ALREADY ACTOR. THE BILL ALSO PROHIBITS IT SENATE THOSE FROM INTELLIGENT CONSUMERS TO CREATE A NEW CREDIT HISTORY. BUT USING A DIFFERENT NAME OR EMPLOYEE EMPLOYEE IDENTIFICATION NUMBER. THE BILL REQUIRES UPFRONT DISCLOSURES DETAILED INFORMATION CONSUMERS NEED TO KNOW INCLUDING THE CREDIT REPORT ENTRIES THAT ARE GOING TO BE CHALLENGED THE BASIS FOR THAT CHALLENGE THE EXPECTED COSTS IN THE AMOUNT OF TIME NEEDED TO CHALLENGE THE GENTRY. HOST OF CLOSURES WILL HELP CONSUMERS FULLY UNDERSTAND THE SCOPE AND THE COST OF THE SERVICES BEING OFFERED. I IMAGINE THAT THE OPPONENTS OF AB TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FOUR WILL TAKE THE CHECK A LITTLE APPROACH AND SUGGEST THE PERFECT I WILL SURELY FALL IF THIS BILL PASSES. IT WOULD ELIMINATE CREDIT REPAIR SERVICES FOR THE PEOPLE WHO NEED THEM PROBABLY. THE MOST. IN FACT pKIND. THE ROUGHLY EIGHTY NONPROFIT COMPANY CONTINUES THAT WE ROUTINELY PROVIDE. CREDIT REPORT REVIEWS AND PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT REPAIRING CREDIT FOR FREE. TO BE FAIR HOWEVER I WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE SOME CONSUMERS WHO INSIST THEY JUST CAN'T WORK ON THE CURRENT ON THEIR OWN. THE MATTER HOW YOU DO THE PROCESSES ARE HOW LITTLE TIME IT TAKES. THAT IS CERTAINLY TRUE. FOR THOSE CONSUMERS AB TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FOUR WILL PROVIDE PROTECTIONS IN THE FORM OF REASONABLE GUARDRAILS THAT EVERY REPUTABLE SERVICE PROVIDERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THEM.

THANK YOU FOR PRONOUNCING MY NAME CORRECTLY ONLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA'S MY NAME TO PRONOUNCE RIGHT. THE REPORTERS ARE. MISTER CHAIRMAN I THINK THE PASTORS IN- LISTED ITS FIRST WOULD IT BE OKAY IF WE SWITCHED ORDER THAT WOULD BE FUN OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBER FOR TAKING MY TESTIMONY- I DON'T REALLY WANT TO GET CAUGHT UP IN A IN A BACK AND FORTH WITH WITH THE DEBT COLLECTORS ON THEIR BILL- I WANNA TALK ABOUT CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA. THOSE OF THE PEOPLE THAT MATTER THOSE OF PEOPLE HERE TO ADDRESS AND I WANT TO GO OVER SOME STATISTICS. CALIFORNIA ALONE WE ADDRESS ONE POINT SEVEN NEGATIVE. ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION NGATIVE TRADE LINES OR NEGATIVE ITEMS ON PEOPLE'S CREDIT REPORT LAST YEAR IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. OF THOSE ONE POINT SEVEN WE WERE ABLE TO CLEAR HALF A MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE. IN YOUR DISTRICT ALONG MISTER CHAIRMAN THERE WAS FOURTEEN THOUSAND CREDIT LINES THAT WERE REMOVED FROM CONSUMERS IN YOUR DISTRICT HEAR A LOT ABOUT COMPLAINTS WE DON'T SEE ANY OF THEM. THE CFPB LAST YEAR. HAD FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND COMPLAINTS TO THE PORTAL COMPLAINT PORTAL. OF THE FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND ONE. WERE ABOUT US QUICKER NOW THAT'S ONE HUNDRED ONE TOO MANY ADMITTED. THAT COLLECTORS AT SEVEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED COMPLAINTS. SEVEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED. OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS THE FOR THE CALIFORNIA BBB HAS RECEIVED EIGHTY FIVE COMPLAINTS ABOUT US EIGHTY FIVE REIMBURSED. SO EVERY TIME I HEAR ABOUT ALL THESE COMPLAINTS BUT I DON'T SEE THEM IT'S CONCERNING TO ME. SECONDLY THIS IS SUPPOSEDLY CONSUMER BILL. YES BROUGHT BY DEBT COLLECTORS TO MAKE AN ENTIRE LIVING. TAKING PEOPLE TO COURT SEEKING DEFAULT JUDGMENTS AND BLOWING UP THE FUNDS TO COLLECT MONEY. NOT ONE CONSUMER GROUP IF YOU'RE IN FAVOR OF THIS BILL. AND WHEN THEY SAY THE CONSUMER FEDERATION. OF THAT SETTLEMENT FOLKS THERE GIVEN THAT SETTLEMENT AND THAT NONPROFIT IS USUALLY FUNDED BY CREDITORS. SO THERE'S A CONFLICT OF INTEREST. WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THE WORK WE DO ASK THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE IF THE THIS BILL PASSED. WITH THE FIGURES THAT I GAVE YOU WITH THE GO UP OR DOWN NEXT YEAR WOULD MORE CALIFORNIA'S BENEFIT FROM CREDIT REPAIR SERVICES WOULD BE WORSE MANY OF YOU ARE CHAMPIONS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT'S A HUGE PROBLEM IN THE STATE. CREDIT IS A MAJOR PLAYER IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE STATE. IF YOU HAVE POOR CREDIT. YOU'RE LESS LIKELY TO GET AFFORDABLE HOUSING WELL IF THERE'S NOBODY HERE TO FIGHT FOR YOU. AND YOUR CREDIT REPAIR NEEDS. HOW ARE YOU GONNA DO IT YOURSELF. PEOPLE I HEAR ALL THE TIME WHAT PEOPLE COULD DO THEMSELVES WILL MY MOTHER IS ELDERLY SHE BARELY SPEAKS ENGLISH SHE WOULD EVEN KNOW WHERE TO START THE FEDERAL CREDIT. WOULD EVEN KNOW WHERE TO START. AND NOW WE'RE SAYING YOU DON'T WANT. THAT COLLECTORS HAVE AT IT GO AFTER MY MOM. FOR SORT OF PICTURE CREDITORS OF WHICH YOU CAN BURY DEFENDERS OF. WE STAND BETWEEN THAT COLLECTIVE TO CONSUMERS WITH THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE. AND THEY WANT TO HAVE I WAS REMOVED. NOW I RESPECT THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL I THINK IT TOO AND TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING IT'S CLEAR FROM YOUR HISTORY. YOUR BIG FIGHT ACROSS CALIFORNIA I JUST THINK THIS ISN'T THE RIGHT BILL FOR THAT. SO THANK YOU MISTER. WELL THANK YOU ALMOST. ASSEMBLY WOMAN RUBIO AND- A- GERMAN. GRAYSON I'M PASS AUDREY CHAPLAIN PASTOR THE PICTURES LOS ANGELES. I'M MORE IMPORTANTLY- I LEAD A NONPROFIT. CALLED THE AFRICAN AMERICAN EMPALME COALITION. WE'RE I'M ACTUALLY IN THE STREETS. IN IN IN IN THE NET AT GROUND LEVEL DOING TO ACTUAL WORK- HELP MARKET ARTS CONSTITUENTS ARE CITIZENS. IN OUR COMMUNITY. I WITH FINANCIAL LITERACY WE DO WORKSHOPS TWICE A WEEK I SEE ABOUT TWO. TO THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE DIFFERENT PEOPLE ACH EACH MONTH- OF WHICH WE TALK A LOT ABOUT. CREDIT RESPONSIBILITY CREDIT REPAIR. AND CREDIT RECOVERY. AND SO. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THIS BILL I'M I'M IMPACTED BECAUSE I GREW UP. AND YOU KNOW MOST AFTER AMERICANS AND DOES LITTLE. BLACK AND BROWN NOBODY TEACHES US ABOUT. CREDIT MANY OF THEM DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT AND- WHERE 54% WITH. WITH POOR OR NO CREDIT REPORT CREDIT ALL- SO WHEN I LOOKED AT THIS BILL. YOU KNOW IT WAS KIND OF INSULTING AN INTERESTING. AND BY- THAT. THERE'S SOME THINGS ABOUT THIS BILL. BETTERMENT SMOKESCREEN BY THE GOOD STUFF BUT THE MAIN THING IS- IT'LL ACTUALLY PUT US IN POSITION TO NOT GET ANY PROFESSIONAL HELP. MOST PEOPLE THAT THAT I COULD WHERE I COME FROM. THEY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO HOW TO GO ABOUT IMPROVING THEIR CREDIT. SO WHY TAKE AWAY THEIR PRIVILEGE. TO HIRE PROFESSIONAL OR- COME TO KEEP IT AFFECTS EVEN ME AS A NON PROFIT- WE GOT A MARK AREN'T MARK ARE. YOU KNOW LETTERS AND ALL THAT KIND OF THING. THAT'S GOING TO BE. IT THAT'S JUST A SMALL SCREEN FOR THE LOOPHOLE. THAT'S IN THE FEDERAL LAW. THAT LETS THEM JUST ALL IT IS A WAY. THAT DOES NOT BENEFIT CALIFORNIANS I'M A PROUD CALIFORNIA- I'M PROUD OF ALL OF OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS BECAUSE ALL OF YOU ARE VERY CONSUMER- FRIENDLY YOU PUT YOU PUT YOUR CITIZENS FIRST- IT'S JUST IRONIC THAT THE CREDITORS- ARE THE ONES TO BRING THE BILL IN ITS I'M INSULTED AT THE SANDY SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF MY COMMUNITY. THAT'S A PROBLEM IT'S NOT CHICKEN LITTLE IS A PROBLEM. INTO YOUR BILL WHERE WE'VE BEEN. HOW DO YOU GET THE RIGHT TO SPEAK FOR US. THE WITH THIS BILL IS- IF US IN A- TO KNOW GIVE YOU THE- THAT WE NEED FOR PROPER. AND SO I I'M IN TOTAL OPPOSITION TO IT. AND I THINK THE MOST OF MY COMMITTEE MY COMMUNITY IF THEY KNEW ABOUT THIS KIND OF THING WE PROBABLY WOULD FILL THIS PLACE UP. SAYING NO WE DON'T WANT THIS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY NOW WE WILL TURN TO THE ROOM ARE THERE ANY OTHERS IN OPPOSITION THAT WOULD LIKE TO STATE THAT OPPOSITION IN THE ROOM. SEEING NONE MODERATOR WE WILL NOT TURN TO THE PHONE LINES ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ON THE PHONE LINE. YOU ARE NOTPOSITION AB TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FOUR IT'S ONE THEN ZERO. ONCE AGAIN OPPOSITION AND ONE THEN ZERO. WE DO HAVE SO MANY QUEUING UP HERE'S A LOOK AT JUST ONE MOMENT. BUT AGAIN WE'RE LOOKING FOR OPPOSITION. OKAY MAKING HIMSELF UP TO YOU SO WE DO NOT HAVE ANYBODY IN CONSTRUCTION. THANK YOU FOR THAT MODERATOR I WILL NOW CLOSE- WITNESS TESTIMONY BRING IT TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS ASSEMBLY MEMBER STOP YOU COULD ADDRESS THE OPPOSITION THAT THEY RAISE ME DID IT DOES SEEM LIKE. WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT CONSUMERS. AND THEN WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT CONFUSING SO ABSOLUTELY- TAKE ON THE ABSOLUTELY- YOU KNOW AND YOU MADE A STATEMENT ABOUT HIRING A PROFESSIONAL- TO HELP YOU WITH A CREDIT REPORT AND I'VE BEEN IN SITUATIONS. AS A COMMUNITY MEMBER AND A FORMER TEACHER AND A WOMAN OF COLOR I CAN TELL YOU THAT MY COMMUNITY IS EXACTLY LIKE YOUR COMMUNITY AND WHEN WE HIRE PROFESSIONAL UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT THIS IS THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN- AND IT DOESN'T HAPPEN WE ALSO DON'T UNDERSTAND WHERE WE CAN GO TO MAKE THAT CHANGE- BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE FINANCIAL LITERACY WE DON'T HAVE THE- THE- LITERACY TO. TO NAVIGATE SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND SO SPECIFICALLY MY INTEREST IN THIS BILL WAS- BACKED ON THE FIELD THE SEATTLE WILL BE REQUIRED TO. SPECIFY WHAT YOUR CREDIT- TRADE LINES ARE GOING TO WORK ON IN THE CONTRACT I'VE BEEN ONLINE WHERE WHERE ALL THESE CREDIT REPAIR REPAIR AGENCIES SAY ALL WE'RE GOING TO FIX IT IT DOESN'T SAY SPECIFICALLY HOW. RIGHT AND THAT'S TO YOUR POINT WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT SO I'M NOT TRYING TO ELIMINATE- KIND OF THE SERVICE OF THE OF THE INDUSTRY BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE OF US THAT DON'T UNDERSTAND- GET SPECIFIC INFORMATION AS TO WHERE AND AGAIN WHAT THE WHAT TRADE LINES ARE GOING TO WORK ON- AND PROVIDE MONTHLY STATEMENTS TO CONSUMERS WHICH SHOW THE WORK DONE IN EXCHANGE- MY COMMUNITY MEMBERS KEEP PAYING AND PAYING AND PAYING. AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE PAYING FOR SO I A MONTHLY REPORT TO OUTLINE WHAT THEY'RE SPECIFICALLY WORKING ON- ON THEIR BEHALF WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT THAT I THINK WOULD BE BENEFICIAL I'M- ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE BEING CHARGED FEES- YOU WE ALL GOT INTO THE TRAPS WHERE YOU SIGN UP AND IF YOU DON'T CANCEL YOU KEEP GETTING THE FEES CHARGED WHEN YOU'RE IN A FINANCIAL SITUATION LIKE THAT. THE LAST THING YOU DO IS START CHECKING YOUR BILLS BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID OF LOOKING AT THOSE BILLS AND SO YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO STOP THAT MONTHLY CHARGE- FROM THE CONSERVADOR CREDIT REPAIR AGENCY AND ALSO GIVE CONSUMERS COPIES OF THE LETTERS SENT ON THEIR BEHALF- THE- TWO YOUR- THE COME. HOW BEEN ABOUT THESE GENERIC LETTERS RIGHT WELL THE CONSUMER NEVER GETS TO SEE THOSE WHATEVER YOU SEND. MY TURN UP WHAT IT WHATEVER YOU SEND- AGAIN WE'RE ALL AFRAID OF LOOKING IN THE MAIL FOR THOSE BILLS YOU'RE NOT LOOKING AT THE MAIL YOU'RE NOT LOOKING ONLINE AND YOU'RE NOT CHECKING YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR BILLING FORM FOR ME SPECIFICALLY I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE CONSUMERS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. HAVE SPECIFICS AS TO WHAT'S BEING DONE ON THEIR BEHALF INSTEAD OF YOU KNOW TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HEY IT'S BEEN SIX MONTHS AND NOTHING HAS HAPPENED AND SO THAT'S REALLY THE INTENT FOR ME NOT TO PUT YOU OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE TRUST AND BELIEVE THAT I KNOW HOW MANY OF MY FOLKS IN THE BACK. WE ALL WANT- WE ALL HAVE THE DREAM OF HOMEOWNERSHIP AND YOU CAN'T DO THAT WITHOUT A GOOD CREDIT SO I'M NOT TRYING TO PUT YOU ON A BUSINESS I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE HELPING OF THAT WE'RE TRYING TO HELP. HAVE THE INFORMATION AS TO WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THEIR BEHALF AND MOST IMPORTANTLY TO ME AS- IF NOTHING'S HAPPENING THEY DON'T KEEP PAYING THAT MONTHLY FEE IF NOTHING IS HAPPENING AND SO AGAIN I'M NOT TRYING TO PUT YOU OUT OF BUSINESS I'M TRYING TO JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING IS CLEAR. WHEN YOU'RE IN A FINANCIAL SITUATION LIKE THAT THE LAST THING WE ALL PUT OUR HANDS IN THAT OUR HEAD IN THE SAND TRYING TO IGNORE EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON AND IF THESE ARE C. AS OLDER PROMISING. TO FIX FOLKS CREDIT THEM THAT'S WHAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING SO- I DON'T KNOW IF THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION BUT FOR ME THAT'S THE INTENT OF THIS BILL. THANK GOODNESS ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE FOR THAT QUESTION VICE CHAIR. GEN THANK YOU MISTER ADULTS. AS ONE TO THANK AS A MEMBER. BRING THIS. IMPORTANT AFFORD YOU KNOW I BELIEVE THAT ONE OF THE MAIN ISSUES OF THIS BILL THAT. HELPS CONSUMERS IS THE ISSUE TRANSPARENCY AND I THINK. WITH THIS BILL IT GIVES. THE CONSUMER AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE INTELLIGENT DECISION REGARDING THEIR- THEIR CREDIT SERVICE REPAIR ALSO- PREVENTS FROM ANY UNFAIR. OR DECEPTIVE ADVERTISING AND FOR ME PERSONALLY I THINK HAVING A- A QUICK REPORTER CONSUMER REPORT GIVEN TO THE CONSUMER. IS NOT. OPPRESSIVE AND I THINK ACTUALLY IT'S CRUZ TRANSPARENCY IN INFORMATION TO THE CONSUMER. AND WHICH- THEY CAN MAKE A- INFORMED. INTELLIGENT INSIGHTFUL DECISIONS SO I'M A CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL. AND ON. A PART OF SUPPORTERS OF THANK YOU FOR BRINGS FORTH. THANK YOU VICE CHAIR AND THIS MEMBER. BARKHANE THANK YOU AND I WON I THINK MISS BILL FOR SO ELOQUENTLY- EXPLAINING THE BENEFITS OF THIS BILL I THINK IT HAS A LOT IN IT THAT'S REALLY GOOD THAT WILL PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY BETTER ENFORCEMENT AND OVERSIGHT I THINK THE HEART OF WHAT THERE IS I MEAN IF I THOUGHT THERE WERE TWO ISSUES THAT THE OPPOSITION WAS REALLY FOCUSED ON ONE COMMITTEE IS ADDRESSED IN THEIR AMENDMENTS FOCUSED ON THE BURDEN OF PROOF AND THE SECOND REMAINS THIS QUESTIONABLE LETTERS RIGHT. AND I GUESS THE QUESTION THAT I WAS LEFT WITH IS. THE PEOPLE THAT I THINK EVERYONE SITTING HERE ON THIS DIRE S. INCLUDING YOU CARES ABOUT OTHER CONSUMERS. RIGHT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE CONSUMERS ARE TAKEN CARE OF FIRST AND FOREMOST. AND YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE STUCK BETWEEN TWO INDUSTRIES BOTH OF WHICH HAVE BAD ACTORS AND- RIGHT AND SO I THINK. I JUST WANT TO CENTER CONVERSATIONS ON THE CONSUMERS AND DOING WHAT IS BEST FOR THEM. AND AS I LOOKED AT THIS QUESTION OF YOU KNOW TAKING AWAY THE ABILITY OF THESE SERVICERS TO SEND COMMUNICATIONS. ON BEHALF OF THEIR CLIENTS IS AN ATTORNEY. WHEN WE CLEAR ATTORNEYS AS YOU SAW THE CONSUMER JOURNEYS WILL. DO IT ALL THE TIME I MEAN THAT IS WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU REPRESENTS ONE OF THEIR BEHALF RIGHT AND I INDICATED THAT I WAS THE ATTORNEYS IN THOSE LETTERS BUT- WHEN YOU'RE WORKING ON SOMEONE YOU HAVE THAT POWER OF ATTORNEY TO DO IT YOU CAN WRITE. ON THEIR BEHALF AS THEY DO AND WE'RE TAKING THAT ABILITY AWAY AS- THE- ANALYSIS CLEARLY INDICATED UNDER FEDERAL LAW IT WOULD THEN STOP THE DEBT COLLECTORS FROM HAVING TO RESPOND. IN THE SAME WAY AS IF IT'S WRITTEN FROM THE CONSUMER. SO THAT PEACE DOES NOT FEEL LIKE. THERE'S A BENEFIT TO THE CONSUMER AND I GUESS I WOULD LIKE THE SPONSORS TO EXPLAIN WHAT THEY SEE THE BENEFIT TO CONSUMERS MAX THAT'S NOT A TRANSPARENCY ISSUE. STILL PROBABLY GO AHEAD AND TAKE THAT WHEN I THINK WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS. IN ULTIMATELY THIS- WHETHER OR NOT THE DEBT COLLECTORS ARE OBLIGATED UNDER CURRENT FEDERAL LAW TO RESPOND TO IT A CONSUMER DISPUTE AND VALIDATE THAT DEBT- THIS ISSUE CAME UP WE ACTUALLY DID ENTER AN AMENDMENT INTO OUR BILL THAT REQUIRES ALL DEBT COLLECTORS. I'M NOT REGARDLESS OF THE SENDER WE HAVE TO NOW RESPONDS TO EACH AND EVERYONE OF THOSE DISPUTES. OKAY SO- WHETHER IT'S FEDERAL LAW OR STATE LAW THE STATE LAW NOW IS ENTERED INTO TWO FOUR TWO FOUR- WHICH REQUIRES ALL OF US TO RESPOND WHETHER IT'S DISCLOSES THAT ITS PROMISE YES SO OR WHETHER IT'S FROM AN ATTORNEY OR WHETHER IT'S FROM THE DEBTOR THEMSELVES. AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT ANSWERS YOUR NO BECAUSE I ASKED WITH A BENEFIT TO THE CONSUMER AS OF THEM IDENTIFYING THEMSELVES AND I STILL DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER OKAY. SO THE OTHER BENEFIT TO THAT IS IF RIGHT NOW THE- IF THE LETTER IS COMING DIRECTLY FROM THE CONSUMER OR- THE CONTRACT WITH THIS YES SO. WE DO NOT KNOW THAT THE- THE CSO IS THAT DISPUTE VALIDATION IS GOING DIRECTLY TO THE CONSUMER THE CSO HAS NO IDEA THAT WE HAVE ALREADY VALIDATED AND PROVIDED PROOF. TO THE CONSUMER. VALIDATING THAT ACCOUNT. SO THEN THEY CONTINUE TO GET CHARGE FROM THE CSM. IT'S LIKE THIS PERPETUAL LOOP. THAT IS NOT CLOSED AND SO THEY CONTINUE TO GET CHARGED BY THE CSO. SO OKAY SO WHAT I'M HEARING FROM THE COLLECTORS IS THAT THE BENEFIT IS THAT IT WOULD SAVE THE CONSUMER MONEY BECAUSE OF THE LETTER WENT DIRECTLY TO THE SERVICING ORGANIZATION. THEN THAT CHARGES WOULD STOCK IT CLOSES THAT LOOP IF THE DATA IS VALID AND WE PROVIDE THE PROOF READING THIS IS A VALID DEBT HERE'S A STATEMENT OF ACCOUNT. OKAY BATES REPORTED AS A DISPUTED COUNTING YOUR CREDIT OKAY THAT CLOSES THE LOOP IT'S NOT IT'S A VALID ACCOUNT CANNOT BE REMOVED- IF IT'S PAID THEN IT'S SHOWING AS PAID BUT WHATEVER'S BEING REPORTED TO THE CONSUMER CREDIT FATHER HAS ACCURATE TRUE CORRECT RIGHT. UNDERSTOOD SO I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR THE OPPOSITION'S RESPONSE TO THAT WOULD THAT HELP THE CONSUMER KNOW WHERE. I'D WE COMMUNICATE WITH OUR CONSUMERS ALL THE TIME THEY HAVE ACCESS TO A PORTAL WITH A SIGN ON SEE EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENING IN THE ACCOUNT ACTIVE. REAL TIME SERVICE THERE IS IT'S UNDENIABLE THAT FEDERAL LAW TRUMPS. STATE LAW ON THIS ISSUE EVEN THE COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES THAT KNOWLEDGE IS IT. ON PAY AT I WILL GO THROUGH IT ON. IN HERE THE COMMITTEE THE COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS WILL MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR CSOS TO OPERATE IN THE STATE. TO DENY THE FEDERAL LAW WHICH TRUMP HERE IS JUST A MISAPPLICATION AND MISINTERPRETATION OF THE LAW. IF WE HAVE TO MARK OUR LETTERS. THEY CAN SIMPLY IGNORE THE LETTERS. THERE'S BEEN TWO FEDERAL LAWSUITS WITHIN THE LAST YEAR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT TENTH CIRCUIT WOULD AFFECT ELECTORS BROUGHT SUIT AGAINST US ON THIS MARKET ISSUE. WE WON IN BOTH CASES. SO THIS IS FOR- SHOPPING THIS IS FINDING A STATE THEY'LL DO WHAT THE COURT WILL DO. THEY'RE ASKING THIS LEGISLATIVE PLEASE DO WITH THE COURTS WILL DO. AND CORRECTED SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO RESPOND TO THESE CONSUMERS CLEAR AS DAY WE HAVE A LEGAL OPINION ON FILE AS WELL. OKAY SO YOU DIDN'T ANSWER MY QUESTION HERE SO. THAT WOULD BE EVEN MORE I'M HAPPY TO THE WHY QUESTION WAS IF THE LETTER WERE TO GO TO YOU INSTEAD OF THE CONSUMER AS THE SPONSORS HAVE INDICATED WITH THAT CLOSE THE LOOP AND THE CHARGES FOR THE CONSUMER THAT'S THE BENEFIT THAT'S BEEN DESCRIBED TO ME BY THE SPONSORS ONCE. ONCE THE DATA HAS BEEN VALIDATED ON SOMEONE'S CREDIT REPORT THAT THE CONSUMER THAN THE RELATIONSHIP CEASES WITH US IT WOULD BE A MATTER OF SEMANTICS FOR THE LETTER GOES TO THEM THEY TELL US OR WE GET THE LETTER IT'S- SO HOW OFTEN DO CONSUMERS AND I YOU MAY NOT KNOW THIS UP HAVE YOUR HATS I'M GOING TO GIVE. A LITTLE BIT OF GRACE HERE BUT I GUESS SO I'M AS THE AUTHOR SAID YOU KNOW I AM A- BUSY PERSON WHO CHECKED MY MAIL IN THE MAIL BY MY DOOR MAY PILE UP EDUCATION. I THINK MANY OF US IN THIS ROOM EXPERIENCE WHEN WE'RE BUSY- AND SO I GET THOSE LETTERS BACK. VALIDATED IT AND NOW THE RELATIONSHIP ISN'T CEASING TO EXIST BECAUSE IT'S SITTING IN MY PILE BY THE DOOR AND YOU HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING. SO I THAT I THINK SHE HAS ACTUALLY INDICATED A SITUATION THAT WOULD CAUSE THE CONSUMERS TO PAY MORE I MEAN YOU HAVE. A RESPONSE TO THAT SO THE SCENARIO WOULD BE THAT THE LETTER WOULD COME TO US AND THEN WE WOULD KNOW IT'S VALIDATED SO WE WOULD BE ABLE TO STOP THE RELEASE YES. MAY I MAY COME. IN EVERY CREDIT. A DOES HAVE THIS THEY HAVE A SUBSCRIPTION PAID TO BEGIN WITH. I MEAN I THINK WITH THE ONE THE BABY OUT WITH THE WATER- WE- WE DON'T DO THAT. I MEAN SUPPORT AS A NONPROFIT- IF THEY GET THE LETTER THERE IS NOT GOING TO BE A CHARGE THE NEXT MONTH SO. I MEAN. IT HURTS IT HURTS EVERYBODY SOLD IN A PERSON HURTS THE MOST IS GOING TO BE CONSUMER. GOT IT I MEAN IS THERE A WAY I GUESS I'M TRYING TO FIND A HAPPY MEDIUM BECAUSE I SEE THE BENEFIT THE CONSUMER. IS CLEARED TO HAVE PEOPLE LIKE THE PASTOR SENDING THESE LETTERS ON THEIR BEHALF THIS IS A MORASS AS ACTUALLY. BEING ALICE'S INDICATED. THIS IS COMPLICATED. THE AVERAGE CONSUMER CANNOT DO THIS ON THEIR OWN AND SO THE IDEA THAT. WE'RE SAYING THAT YOU CAN'T DO THIS ON THEIR BEHALF- IF YOU DO IT ON THEIR BEHALF THEY'RE NOT GONNA GET THE SAME LEVEL OF RESPONSIVENESS DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT TO ME. BUT I DO UNDERSTAND. YOU KNOW THAT WE WANT YOU TO HAVE THE INFORMATION THAT'S BEEN VALIDATED IF THAT. ENDS THE CYCLE OF PAYING FOR THE CONSUMER. SO IS THERE A WAY TO DO BOTH IS THERE A WAY TO ENSURE IT. I MEAN I GUESS IF YOU'RE NOT LISTED THERE'S NO WAY FOR THE- COLLECTORS TO KNOW TO SEND IT TO YOU. RIGHT WHICH WAS THE ARGUMENT MADE BY THE SPONSORS- SO. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SOLUTION HERE IS BUT I THINK THAT- THIS PIECE OF THE BILL FEELS LIKE ADS WRITTEN. NEED IT TO BE RIGHT WE'RE SEIZING ALL COMMUNICATIONS THAT WOULD ADEQUATELY GET A RESPONSE WHICH I DON'T THINK IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CONSUMER AS THE PASTOR IS SAYING- BUT WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ONCE IT'S VALIDATED THEY'RE NO LONGER PAYING BECAUSE THE SERVICE IS. DONE SO I THINK YOU KNOW I TRUST THE AUTHOR AND I THINK WE CAN GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE'RE DOING BOTH OF THOSE THINGS AND PROTECTING AND REALLY AGAIN CENTRING THE CONSUMER AND THAT'S BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONES WE CARE MOST ABOUT. BUT IT IS CRITICAL TO ME THAT THOSE LETTERS CONTINUE TO BE RESPONDED TO AND SENT BY THE PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND THIS SYSTEM. BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE CONSUMERS WHO HAVE THE DEBT. AND WE ALL KNOW THAT SO- YOU KNOW I'LL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY BUT I REALLY HOPE WE CAN WORK TO GET THAT PASSED. ABSOLUTELY AT THE END OF THE DAY THE TO THE YOU KNOW TO YOUR POINT IS OUR GOAL IS TO- PROTECT THE CONSUMER AND IT YOU KNOW TO THE PASTOR'S POINT THERE'S SO MANY. PEOPLE THAT HAVE GOTTEN THEMSELVES IN SITUATIONS THAT THEY CAN'T GET OUT OF I DON'T WANT TO STOP THEM FROM BEING ABLE TO BE HELPED BY THE SAME TOKEN WHEN YOU'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE WHERE YOU'RE KIND OF- I GOT A- A- ROPE AROUND YOUR NECK YOU KNOW YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO AND SELL. I THANK YOU FOR THAT WE DO HAVE ANOTHER MEMBER HAS A QUESTION DR CHOI. GET THE YOUR STATE INTO YOUR- PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS SO TO PROTECT THE CONSUMERS ABOUT THE- PROVISIONS- SAYS THAT THE YOUR YOUR- US YES SOUL- TO FIND THIS IS SET FEDERAL RECOGNITION- WITH THE IDEA FOR PI. FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS AND THAT THIS FEE WILL KEEP ON INCREASING ESTIMATED THAT THERE'S NO NOR LIMITATION SO WHO KNOWS OF SEOUL- EVENTUALLY OF WHEN THIS FEE RISES ONCE MORE WATER AND UP BY PAYING A LOT MORE FOR THEIR FEES SEOUL. I'M IN A TO ME IT IS NOT THE. PROTECTING THE CONSUMERS. I'M LOOKING AT WHEN SURE TO ANSWER EXISTING LAW RIGHT NOW- RICK. FOR THE CSOS GOOD REGISTER PROCESS AND THAT FEE TO REGISTER IS A HUNDRED DOLLARS AND THAT'S CURRENTLY THE OVERSIGHT FOR THAT CURRENTLY LIES WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL- AND SO REALLY WHAT THIS IS LOOKING TO DO NOW IS SHIFT THAT OVER. INTO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL PROTECTION BECAUSE THAT IS THE DEPARTMENT NOW THAT IS THE WATCHDOG FOR CONSUMERS SO THE BILL AS PROPOSED THERE IS NO INCREASE IT IS SIMPLY STATED IT IS STILL THE ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS AS WHICH IS ORIGINALLY PROPOSED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR SO THERE IS NO INCREASE THE DF PI AS THEY ARE GETTING THROUGH THEIR LICENSING IF THEY DEEM IT DOWN THE ROAD THEY MAY RESERVE THE RIGHT. TO INCREASE THEIR REGISTRATION FEES DOWN THE ROAD BUT THAT IS NOT THE INTENT OF THE BILL AS DRAFTED I'M SORRY IN. THE WHAT I READ ABOUT YOU YOUR BILL IS OTHER. IT OR ALLOW THE FBI TO PERIODICALLY INCREASE THE FEE. THEY MAY IF THEY SO CHOOSE WHAT SORT. DOES THE POINT UP PERIODICALLY KNOW PERIODICAL COULD BE EVERY MONTH EVERY YEAR HOMEOWNERS AND THE TO THE TO THE LIMITS THAT THAT THEY WANT TO CHARGE CORRECT- AND I UNDERSTAND IT'S JUST IT'S A REGISTRY AND NOT A LICENSING- IT SO THERE IS A DIFFERENCE- SO IT'S A SIMPLE APPLICATION PROCESS FOR THE CSOS RIGHT NOW TO BE ABLE TO FILL OUT. AND COMPLETE THE REGISTRATION. DID YOU HAVE P. I. CURRENT RAMPING UP- RIGHT NOW IN ORDER TO COVER A LOT OF DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS AND LICENSING INCLUDING DEBT COLLECTIONS. RIGHT NOW SO IT AND WE'RE SUBJECT TO THE SAME FEES AND REGISTRATIONS AS WELL SO I UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT- IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN CONTROL IT'S COMPLETELY UP TO THE BUDGET AND THE FBI. THEY DO RESERVE THE RIGHT AND IT SAYS THEY MAY. SWING DOWN THE REAL BILL HAS NO ABILITY TO LIMIT TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS THERE THERE IS A AYE BUT THERE THERE IS A LIMIT- IN THE WAY THAT IT'S CURRENTLY WORDED RIGHT NOW. TO CA- FORGIVE ME AND HAVE TO TURN TO THAT. AND IT SHALL NOT EXCEED THAT WHICH IS REASONABLY UNNECESSARY. TO SATISFY THE D. F. P. I.

AND THE LARGE OR SMALL ON THROUGH ASSUME-MEETINGS- THE FOR JOINT MEETINGS. I MEAN THIS IS A FULL COOPERATION IS- HOWTHEY CONDUCT A MEETING. IN PERSON OR BY TELEPHONE WAS SOON A WHY I WONDER OF THE LEGISLATURE HAS TO GET INTO IT AND THE GOVERNMENT YES YOU CAN MEET. IN A VIRTUALLY ALL WHITE IN PERSON ONLY. AND THAT MAY BE- THE NON. A IN SUPPORT THE WITNESS YOU CAN. TYLER'S IN YOUR OPINION IN PERSON MEETING VERSUS OF WHICH ARE WHAT ARE THE PROS AND CONS. YEAH. YEAH CAN'T COUNT ON BEHALF OF SEMPRA- IT'S HARD SAID MOST OF OUR INVESTORS ARE INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS WE HAVE A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL SHAREHOLDERS THE OPPORTUNITY I GUESS WOULD BE TO BE ABLE TO TALK DIRECTLY TO THE SHAREHOLDERS ORTO THE TO THE BOARD BUT YOU HAVE THAT SAME ABILITY. HAVE REMOTELY SO I DON'T I DON'T REALLY KNOW AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY ISSUES WITH THE REMOTE ANOTHER BENEFIT OF THE FIVE YEAR EXTENSION IS TO SEE IF THERE IS ANYTHING THAT WE'RE NOT AWARE OF BECAUSE TO THIS POINT WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY. REAL DIFFERENCE AND GREATER PARTICIPATION A HIGH NUMBER OF OUR NON INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS ARE SENIORS THEY INVEST FOR THE DIVIDENDS- AND DON'T PARTICIPATE ALL THAT FREQUENTLY IN THE YEAH I DO BELIEVE IN IN PERSON CONTACT IS AT THE FRONT ENVIRONMENT THE HOWEVER. IN A SERIES OF BUSINESSES- INTERRUPTIONS QUESTIONS CAN BE RAISED EVEN PHONE WAS ON MEETING SET BUT THAT'S WHY I JUST DON'T YOU KNOW WHEN I READ THIS ONE MY GOVERNMENT HAS TO. GET INTO THE IS AND THE GULF ON. HOW THE GOING TO THE MEAT SHOULD BE CONDUCTED ON BOARD MADE SHOULD BE CONDUCTED. THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT COMPARTE CORRECTLY BUT I THINK IT'S BEEN LAW SINCE THE MID SEVENTIES FOR IN PERSON. MEETINGS AND WE JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO ENGAGE IN THAT BACKGROUND. INDUCTOR COMING OUT I THINK PART OF IT TOO IS IT GIVES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR OF THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE SOME LEADERSHIP AND GUIDANCE FOR SOME OF THE COMPANIES THAT WE HAVE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DURING THIS TUMULTUOUS TIMES DURING A PANDEMIC IN TERMS OF THEIR CONFUSION SO TO ME THAT'S BILLS PRAGMATIC IN TERMS OF ITS APPROACH. I DO SUPPORT. THANK YOU DOCTOR. SO WE DO HAVE A MOTION- FROM DOCTOR CHOI. AND WE DO HAVE A SECOND FROM THE CINEMA ROBERT K. AND- ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS OF THE DICE.

ASSEMBLY MEMBER JIM BY STATE WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE A CLOSING STATEMENT MR ARE RESPECTFUL FOR PASSWORD IPHONE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I DO COMMEND YOU FOR BEING A LITTLE LEADER ON THIS ISSUE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GIVE CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES ESPECIALLY IN COMPANIES SOME ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY ESPECIALLY- WITH WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR ANNUAL MEETINGS AND SOME AFFECT YOU AND I JUST WORK TOGETHER TO PASS A SHORT TERM EXTENSION THAT ALLOWS FOR FULLY REMOTE SHAREHOLDER MEETINGS UNTIL JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. WHICH IS A MUCH NEEDED FIRST STEP WHILE COVERED NINETEEN PANDEMIC CONTINUES TO CAUSE- THE BECAUSE A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY FOR BUSINESSES RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT I DO HAVE- I HAVE BEEN LESSEN COMP ABOUT MAKING THIS OPTION PERMITS I DO WORRY THAT WE DO LOSE SOMETHING- WHEN IT COMES TO VALUE BY HAVING THESE MEETINGS BE FULLY REMOTE ON A ON A PERMANENT BASIS AND AFTER ALL- COMMUNICATION DEBATE WORKS DIFFERENTLY IN PERSON- THE BATES YOUR- THEY SAY THAT COMMUNICATION 70% OF ALL COMMUNICATION IS NONVERBAL. AND SO- I APPRECIATE THE ALL THE DIFFERENT PLATFORMS WE HAVE OUT THERE TO GO VIRTUAL BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND I BELIEVE- THE SIGNIFICANT VALUE OF IN PERSON SO WHILE I AM OPTIMISTIC- THAT REMOTE SHAREHOLDER MEETINGS WILL CONTINUE SERVE BOTH THE SHAREHOLDERS AND THE CORPORATIONS WELL I DO THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO RE VISIT THIS IN FIVE YEARS TO SEE WHAT EXPERIENCE- IT'S BEEN LIKE FOR EVERY PERSN THAT'S OUT THERE BOTH. CORPORATE SIDE AND OTHERS SO WITH THAT I DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SOME OF THE BILL SEVENTEEN EIGHTY TO PASS AS AMENDED GRAYSON.

WITH THAT I WILL. BE BRIEF GOOD AFTERNOON MR VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB. NINETEEN ZERO FOUR THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT THE HARM FROM DECEITFUL PREDATORY MARKETING PRACTICES ESPECIALLY IN THE WORLD OF FINANCIAL SERVICES. IN SOME CASES TARGETING ADVERTISEMENTS- TARGETED ADVERTISEMENTS IDENTIFYING THE CONSUMER BY NAME- AND THEN LIST DEBTS THAT THEY ACTUALLY DON'T EVEN- GIVING THEM THE IMPRESSION THAT THE MAIL IS ACTUALLY FROM A CREDITOR. SO THESE TACTICS CAN BE ESPECIALLY ANXIETY INDUCING AND HARMFUL FOR FINANCIALLY VULNERABLE CONSUMERS- AB NINETEEN ZERO FOUR WILL SIMPLY ADDRESS THIS BY REQUIRING-COMPANIES TO INCLUDE THREE BASIC THINGS IN ANY TARGETED DIRECT ADVERTISEMENT. FIRST THE NAME OF THE COMPANY SECOND THEIR CONTACT INFORMATION AND THEN THIRDLY A STATEMENT THAT INFORMS THE CONSUMER THEY ARE LOOKING AT AN ADVERTISEMENT WITH THAT I DO HAVE A WITNESS HERE TO TESTIFY DANNY CONDO KISER. ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CONSUMER COALITION. GOOD AFTERNOON VICE CHAIRMAN BIRDS IT'S WONDERFUL TO HAVE YOU BACK IN THIS ROOM AGAIN AFTER TWO YEARS. MY NAME IS DANNY KENDALL KAISER I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF CLICK A CLICK AS A STATEWIDE COALITION OF LEGAL AID PROVIDERS THAT SEEK TO ENSURE THAT LOW INCOME CONSUMERS HAVE THEIR VOICES HEARD AND LEGISLATURE. WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF AB NINETEEN OH FOUR WHICH WILL STRENGTHEN THE STANDARDS AROUND DIRECT MARKETING TECHNIQUES USED BY CONSUMER FINANCIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS. LAST YEAR WE WERE PROUD TO PARTNER WITH- FELLOW COMMITTEE MEMBER ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS TO PASS AB FOURTEEN OH FIVE WHICH PUTS IN PLACE NEW RULES FOR DEBT SETTLEMENT PROVIDERS. THIS BILL COMPLIMENTS THAT WORK BY ENSURING THAT DEBT SETTLEMENT PROVIDERS AS WELL AS OTHER TYPES OF SERVICE PROVIDERS. SUCH AS THOSE OFFERING SO CALLED STUDENT DEBT RELIEF FOLLOW BASIC DISCLOSURE RULES WHEN THEY SEND TARGETED ADVERTISEMENTS TO CONSUMERS- INCREASINGLY WE SEE THAT TECHNOLOGY AND BIG DATA EMPOWERING COMPANIES TO DEVELOP SOPHISTICATED WAYS OF REACHING OUT TO CONSUMERS. SOMETIMES THESE ADS DO NOT EVEN LOOK LIKE ADS THEY LOOK LIKE MAIL FROM A BANK OR ANOTHER CREDITOR- AB NINETEEN OH FOUR SIMPLY CREATES A STRAIGHTFORWARD DISCLOSURES SO THAT CONSUMERS ALWAYS KNOW WHEN SOMETHING IS AN ADVERTISEMENT FOR THOSE REASONS WE URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY- WE DO NOT HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL PRIMARY WITNESSES LISTED SO WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE PUBLIC ARE THERE ANY WHEN THIS IS A SUPPORT IN THE HEARING ROOM. SEEING NONE.

TWO ZERO ZERO ONE WHICH WILL ALLOW EMPLOYEES OF LICENSE FINANCE LENDERS TO WORK FROM HOME SO LONG AS THEY FOLLOW CERTAIN RULES AROUND DATA PRIVACY AND RECORD KEEPING IN RESPONSE TO COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC THE ADMINISTRATION GAVE FINANCE LENDER SOME FLEXIBILITY TO ALLOW EMPLOYEES TO WORK FROM HOME THIS TEMPORARY POLICY HAS WORKED WELL BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT WILL EXPIRE WHEN THE STATE OF MERGENCY DOES END SO ALLOWING REMOTE WORK HAS PROVEN VITAL FOR EMPLOYERS INCLUDING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ATTRACTING AND RETAINING TALENT. REMOVING DISABILITY FOR FINANCE LENDERS WILL PLACE AN UNNECESSARY BURDEN ON LICENSEES AS AND THEIR EMPLOYEES SO AB TWO ZERO ZERO ONE SIMPLY AUTHORIZES FINANCE LENDERS TO LET EMPLOYEES WORK FROM HOME BUT ONLY IF THEY COMPLY WITH THE BILL STRONG PROTECTIONS AROUND RECORD KEEPING DATA PRIVACY AND CONSUMER SAFETY THIS BILL DOES GIVE CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES MORE FLEXIBILITY AND A BETTER CHANCE TO COMPETE IN THE MODERN ECONOMY WITH OUT SACRIFICING CONSUMER SAFETY WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE MY WITNESS SCOTT GOVERNOR ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA FINANCIAL SERVICES ASSOCIATION.

THAT INDEPENDENT ESCROW COMPANIES DO WITH ALL THE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AND THEN SOME- THAT EXIST TODAY WITH ONE NOTABLE- ISSUE THAT WE WANTED SAY- THE LANGUAGE THAT WE HAVE PROVIDED COMMITTEE STAFF IN THIS REGARD- TO EXPAND THE BILL.
