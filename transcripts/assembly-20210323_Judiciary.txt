AND WELCOME TO THE FIRST ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY COMMITTEE OF TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY ONE. FOR THOSE WHO ARE WATCHING INTERESTED IN OUR HEARING I NEED TO MENTION A FEW TECHNICAL AND PRACTICAL ISSUES AS WE GET STARTED. DUE TO CONTINUED STAY HOME WATER WE ARE PRACTICING PHYSICAL DISTANCING HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM AS WELL AS THROUGHOUT THE CAPITOL BUILDING. AND WE ARE ONLY ABLE TO HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER OF PEOPLE WATCH AND PARTICIPATE HERE IN PERSON. WE ARE REQUIRING THAT MASKS BE WORN. AND PHYSICAL DISTANCING BE MAINTAINED BY ANY AND ALL MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO WISH TO TESTIFY IN THIS ROOM. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A MASK WE CAN. PROVIDE ONE FOR YOU. BECAUSE OF OUR SPACE LIMITATIONS WE HAVE SOME COMMITTEE MEMBERS SITTING ON THE DAIS AND OTHERS MAY BE SITTING IN THE FIRST TWO ROWS. IN THE AUDIENCE. FOR THOSE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK DURING THE HEARING PLEASE APPROACH THE MICROPHONE. BEHIND THE PLEXIGLAS AND PLEASE REMEMBER TO PRACTICE PHYSICAL DISTANCING. AND WE HAVE A FEW OPTIONS FOR WITNESSES. TODAY FOR TESTIMONY IF YOU ARE HERE IN FORTY TWO OH TWO WE CAN ACCOMMODATE ONLY A MINIMAL CONTINGENT OF STAFF UNLIMITED NUMBER OF PUBLIC OR MEDIA SO WE CAN MAINTAIN THE SIX FEET OF SPACING. THEY'RE ALSO STRICT PHYSICAL DISTANCE PROTOCOLS FOR THE PUBLIC TO ENTER AND LEAVE THE CAPITAL. AS WELL AS FOR THOSE IN THE ROOM AND IF ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY ON A PARTICULAR BILL. PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND I'LL ASK YOU TO APPROACH THE MICROPHONE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. AND WE'RE ASKING THAT NO ONE. PLEASE DON'T TOUCH THE MICROPHONE. FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO WISH TO COMMENT BY A TELEPHONE. THERE IS A THE TOLL FREE NUMBER WHICH IS EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN. SIX NINE TWO. EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN. AND THE PUBLIC ACCESS CODE IS ONE THREE ONE. FIVE FOUR TWO- TO I REPEAT THOSE THE PHONE NUMBER EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN. SIX NINE TWO EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN AND THE ACCESS CODE IS. ONE THREE ONE FIVE. FOUR TWO- TO THE SHOULD BE ON YOUR SCREEN AND IF NOT THEY'LL BE ON THE COMMITTEE'S WEBSITE SO THAT YOU CAN. CALL IN. THE HEARING TODAY WILL BE IN FILE ORDER. AND WE DO NOT YET HAVE A QUORUM BUT WE CAN START AS A SUB COMMITTEE SO WE WILL DO THAT. FIRST UP IS ITEM NUMBER TWO THEN A. B. SEVEN ONE SIX ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENEFITS. MORE IS VERY MUCH GERMAN STILL. I'D LIKE TO THANK THIS COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF UP FOR WORKING UP ON THIS MEASURE AND WE WILL ACCEPT ALL OF THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS THANK YOU WITH THE PANDEMIC THAT HAS RECENTLY HIT. THE IT HAS CHANGED AND WE ARE AT AN INFLECTION POINT IN TERMS OF THE WHOLE ISSUE OF PUBLIC TRANSPARENT- THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES COURTS CAUTIONED THAT THE COURTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY MAINTAIN PUBLIC ACCESS- DURING THE PANDEMIC. AND WE HAVE INSTANCES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHERE THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED IN KERN COUNTY. THEY PROVIDED REMOTE ACCESS TO THE FAMILIES AND FRIENDS OF A DEFENDANT IN A CRIMINAL COURT PROCEEDING BUT NOT TO OTHER PEOPLE. AND I THINK THAT CERTAINLY CHALLENGES THE APPEARANCE OF TRANSPARENCY- IN MY OWN DISTRICT THE OHIO VALLEY NEWS ASKED FOR A REMOTE ACCESS AND THE COURTS TURNED THEM DOWN- AT OPEN WATER EDUCATION HEARING. AND IT WOULD FORCE- A SMALL NEWSPAPER TRYING TO COVER SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITY TRAVEL ALL THE WAY TO LOS ANGELES BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY EXPOSE THEMSELVES TO THE VIRUS AT THE PEAK OF THE PANDEMIC TIME PERIOD. IN A CLOSED COURTROOM. AND THE COURTS SAID YOU HAVE ACT IF YOU WANT TO COME. SO OF THE POPE IT IS NOT OVER WILL BE THE TIME. THAT WE WILL THIS OF OUT THERE TO AB ONE SIX REQUIRES THAT- THE COURTS WHERE IT IS FEASIBLE WHERE THEY ALREADY HAVE THE EQUIPMENT- OPEN THEMSELVES UP AND PROVIDE- THE ACCESS TO THE PUBLIC VIA INTERNET OR TELEPHONE SERVICE. AND THAT WOULD MODERNIZE OUR COURT SYSTEM AND SHOULD BRING US INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY ALL BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY. IT WOULD JUST INCREASED PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY. IN GENERAL I HAVE JUST TWO REFLECTIONS AS I BRING MY COMMENTS TO AMANDA. ONE IS THAT. IN GENERAL MY TIME MOST ORGAN. ARE NOT TENANTS. TO DECREASE PAUL ACTS AND HAVE TO HAVE SOME KIND OF REQUIREMENTS FOR. OR ELSE YOU SAW IN THIS SITUATION IN A PANDEMIC WHERE THE COURTS TOOK ADVANTAGE I SHOULD SAY TAKE ADVANTAGE BUT THEY JUST CHANGE THEIR PROCEDURES AND DECREASED. WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS EMPHASIS ON PUBLIC ACCESS ALSO WE HAVE THIS QUESTION ABOUT VIDEO ACCESS ALSO IT'S A VERY LEGITIMATE QUESTION. BUT I THINK IF IT FALLS INTO THE NATURE OF A LARGER CONVERSATION ARE WE GOING TO ALLOW VIDEO RECORDINGS IN THE COURT ROOM LIFE. BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF WE SIT THERE AND SAY WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW REMOTE ACCESS. THE COURT SYSTEM LOSES CONTROL DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO HAVE A BAN ON LIVE RECORDINGS IN THE COURT ROOM IF WE'RE TURNING AROUND AND- ALLOWING ANYBODY TO COPY A LIVE RECORDING THERE SO THAT'S A LARGER QUESTION. AND I'M COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS AS THIS BILL MOVES THROUGH THE PROCESS- TO TRY TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES- AS THEY COME UP. SO WITH THAT- THE IS A I THINK IN A POOR TIME I URGE A YES I VOTE FOR THIS MAY THING YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MR BY. BEFORE WE TO WITH. OPERATOR YOU CAN MAIL THE LINES FOR B. SEVEN ONE SIX RIGHT NOW. WE DO HAVE A QUORUM SO I'D LIKE TO CALL THE COURT STONE HERE GALLAGHER. CHAU CHIU DAVIES AND SALAS PRESIDENT HOLDEN KALRA KILEY MAIENSCHEIN REYES. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A QUORUM.

VIDEO RECORDINGS WILL BE ALLOWED IN LIVE COURT PROCEEDINGS AND HOW WOULD WE BE PUTTING SOMETHING ON LINE WITH WITH WITH YOUR ALSO AUDIO RECORDINGS ARE NOT ALLOWED AT THIS POINT TIME AND WE WOULD BE PUTTING THIS ON LINE- BUT IT'S CERTAINLY MUCH MORE CHALLENGING FOR THE COURTS TO POLICE VIDEO RECORDINGS- IF THEY- ARE POSTED ONLINE. RATHER THAN. LIVE RECORDINGS OF THE CORPORATE SO WE WILL WORK WITH THOSE ORGANIZATIONS.

MATCH THEIR PREFERRED NAME AND GENDER IDENTITY POSSESSING ACCURATE AND CONSISTENT IDENTIFICATION DOCUMENTS IS ESSENTIAL BASIC SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC FUNCTIONING IT FOR MANY TRANSGENDER PEOPLE OBTAINING VITAL DOCUMENTS THAT MATCH THEIR GENDER IS A MAJOR HURDLE. WHENEVER TRANSGENDER INDIVIDUALS WITH INCONGRUENT IDENTIFICATION DOCUMENTS MUST PRODUCE THEM THERE ARE POTENTIALLY REVEALING THEMSELVES AS TRANSGENDER EACH OF THESE OUTINGS CAN LEAD TO POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS SITUATIONS RANGING FROM BEING HARASSED OR DENIED SERVICES TO BEING PHYSICALLY ASSAULTED. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA TRANCE- TRANSGENDER CALIFORNIANS CAN PETITION THE COURTS TO CHANGE THEIR NAME AND GENDER TO CONFORM TO THEIR IDENTITY THE OPRAH CERTIFICATE IS SEALED A NEW BIRTH CERTIFICATE IS ISSUED AS AN ORIGINAL TO PROTECT BOTH THE PERSON'S PRIVACY AND RESPECT OUR IDENTITY. UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS NOT THE CASE WHEN TRANSGENDER INDIVIDUALS SEEK TO CHANGE TO CHANGE THEIR MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE OR THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE OF THEIR CHILDREN. IN THE EVENT OF THE NAME OR GENDER CHANGE THE OLD CERTIFICATES ARE ATTACHED ANY INCORRECT LEGAL NAME IS STILL LISTED NEXT TO THE CURRENT LEGAL NAME AB TWO ONE EIGHT SIMPLY ALIGNS THE PROCESS FOR UPDATING TRANSCEND AMERISUR DIFFICULT.

THE CPC ULTIMATELY FIND P. JEANNIE ONE HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THESE VIOLATIONS THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE PC INVESTIGATION IT WAS DETERMINED THAT PG&amp;E WOULD LEVERAGE ITS LEGAL RESOURCES TO FILE CLAIMS AGAINST LESS RESOURCEFUL EXCAVATIONS EXCAVATION CONTRACTORS THE INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT AT LEAST ON ONE OCCASION PG&amp;E CREATED A WAR ROOM WITH THE SOLE INTENT TO MAXIMIZE. THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS AGAINST CONTRACTORS EIGHTY NINE THIRTY WILL MAKE UTILITY COMPANIES THINK TWICE BEFORE FIRING OFF FRIVOLOUS CLAIMS IT'LL FORCE. THEM TO INCREASE THE ACCURACY. OTHER UNDERGROUND IN. LOOK PROBE IN C. FOR WORK. AND PUBLIC THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I RESPECT REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE ON THE PHONE TO TESTIFY IS MISTER STEVE WARD VICE PRESIDENT OF PAVEMENT RECYCLING SYSTEMS OF RIVERSIDE COUNTY. MISTER GERALD MASSES FOR THE MASSES LAW FIRM LOCATED IN TUSTIN. RIGHT THANK YOU I DO HAVE MISTER IN THIS MOSES AS SUPPORT QUICKNESS. MISTER. THANK YOU SHERMAN STONE ENTRY NUMBER- AGAIN I AM STEVE WAR WITH PAPER RECYCLING SYSTEM- THE BEST I CAN DO IS OF IT'S IMPORTANT BUDGET. IS. CONVEY A STORY FROM MY BEFORE I WITH PAPERS. ON THE SMALL COME- BUT BECAUSE YOU'RE. IN EMPLOYEES- NOT CHIU AMOUNT OF RESOURCE- ON STATE HIGHWAY PER. IN TWENTY NINE PALMS FOR CALTRANS- WE COMPLETED THE FOR MILLION. ABOUT A YEAR AFTER THE PRODUCT WAS DONE- ARE YOU SEE A BILL FROM CAL EDISON FOR FIVE DOLLARS FOR THEIR CLAIM THAT WE HAD STRUCK ONE OF THE BALL- I REQUEST PHOTOS OF THE DAM. IT WAS ALL ARE QUICKNESS DID NOT DO IT. AND I DECLINE TO PAY THE DOLLARS DOLLARS A KNEW I RIGHT. BUT IT COST US FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO WIN A FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR CASE- CONTRACTORS NOW HAVE LEARNED. ON THESE PLANES YOU JUST PAY THEM THAT'S A BUSINESS DECISION BECAUSE IT WILL COST YOU MORE. BUT WHEN YOU EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW YOU'RE RIGHT- IT MY FEELING AFTER FORTY YEARS IN THIS BUSINESS IS THAT ALL OF THE UTILITIES HAVE DECIDED. THAT HEY WE JUST TORN FRAMES OUT THERE THEY WILL CREATE IT RATHER THAN FIGHT IT BECAUSE IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE TO FIGHT IT. OUT EVEN THE LARGER COMPANIES IT'S JUST A BUSINESS- WHY SPEND FORTY THOUSAND WHEN A FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR CASE. I THANK YOU FOR MUCH FOR YOUR MUCH AND DESERT IS. A HUGE STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. ON PUBLIC WORKS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MOSES. VERY GOOD THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- I'M GERALD HOUSES ON THE MANAGING PARTNER THE MOUSE'S LAW FIRM IN TUSTIN CALIFORNIA ALSO MEMBER OF THE- A BOARD MEMBER OF THE SEVEN CALIFORNIA CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION AND OUR PRACTICES PREDOMINATELY RELATED TO THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY- INCLUDED IT ATTORNEY'S FEES HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN MANY OTHERS STATUTES ALL WITH. THE PURPOSE AND POLICY OF REDUCING LITIGATION PARTICULARLY FRIVOLOUS LITIGATION- OTHER STATUTES THAT EXIST TODAY SUCH AS THE CALIFORNIA FALSE CLAIMS ACT IN THE GOVERNMENT CODE- IT PROVIDES PARTIES WITH THE ABILITY TO. RECOVER ATTORNEYS FEES AND ACTUALLY IN THAT CASE ON BOTH SIDES THE CONTRACTOR NEEDS TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY CLAIM FILE WHICH IS ACCURATE AND TRUTHFUL THAT THE I'S ARE DOTTED AND THE CROSS AS WELL AS THE AGENCY AND CRY IN PROSECUTING A FALSE CLAIM ACTION NEEDS TO. TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT BECAUSE WHOEVER PREVAILS AND THAT AND IF IS FOUND ON THE PART OF THE AGENCY THAT IT'S A FRIVOLOUS CLAIM ATTORNEYS FEES ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE PAID- PROMPT PAYMENT STATUTES EXIST IN THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE IN THE PUBLIC CONTRACTS CODE AGAIN WHEN PAYMENT IS MADE BY AN HONOR TO A GENERAL CONTRACTOR THAT PAYMENT HAS TO BE TURNED AROUND. FOR UNDISPUTED WORK- TO THE SUBCONTRACTOR AND IF NOT THERE IS A RECOVERY FOR ATTORNEYS FEES AND LITIGATION AND OBVIOUSLY THAT PROMOTES THE POLICY NOT ONLY REDUCING LITIGATION BUT HAVING PEOPLE PAY TIMELY HAVERHILL ALSO. OKAY AND THE OTHER. WELL AND I WORK I AM SO THERE'S A I'M SUCH AS A MINISTER- I THINK I THINK THERE IS ON I'M SORRY PAUSING- BUT I DIDN'T KNOW. IN CALIFORNIA CLEAVES WAS A CO FROM COMMITTEE NOT NO- IN ANY OF THE- I WOULD THANK ALL THAT I WILL CONCLUDE- SOMEBODY BRIEFLY HERE. AGAIN THE ANTI STATUTES. BUT DISCLOSURE MADE LIKE TO YELL FOR SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST MOTIONS ARE FILED IN THAT AND THERE ARE PROVISIONS FOR ATTORNEYS FEES SO WHAT ALL THESE STATUTES DEALING WITH AB NINE THIRTY. PROPOSES TO DO IS TO HELP PEOPLE EVALUATE THEIR CLAIMS EARLY ON ESPECIALLY PARTIES AND ATTORNEYS THAT WANT TO BE POTENTIAL LITIGANTS AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE RISK. OF HAVING TO PAY THE OTHER IT SIDE'S ATTORNEYS' FEES NOW THAT DOESN'T EXIST SAYS MR WARD- EXPLAINED IN HIS EXAMPLE- LOSSES CAN BE FILED FRIVOLOUSLY JUST TO GET A NUISANCE VALUE SETTLEMENTS AND I CAN TELL YOU FROM PERSONAL. EXPERIENCE WE HAVE EXPERIENCE THAT ALSO WHERE I'VE HAD A CLIENT SUED AND THEY'VE PAID A NUISANCE SETTLEMENT RATHER THAN DEFENDED ON THE MERITS FOR WE WOULD LIKELY WIN. SO AB NINE THIRTY THE ATTORNEY FEE PROVISION IS CONSISTENT WITH OTHER STATUTES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CALLING FOR ATTORNEYS FEES- THE UNDERLYING POLICIES THAT WILL REDUCE LITIGATION. AND AS- MR LEVINE SO APTLY SAID IT ALSO PROMOTES SAFETY WITH MORE ACCURATE ARKINGS AND- TAKING PLACE RATHER THAN LITIGATION OCCURRING SO- MISTER CHAIR I WOULD URGE AN AYE VOTE AND- THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

MAIENSCHEIN REYES HI RES I. SIX THE BILL IS OUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU RIGHT LET'S MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER SEVEN AB THIRTY FIVE MR CHAU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. I LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING US AUTHORS AMENDMENTS- THE AMENDMENTS LISTED ON PAGE SIX OF THE ANALYSIS WHICH WOULD CLARIFY THAT THE DUTIES REQUIRED BY AB THIRTY FIVE DOES NOT INADVERTENTLY IMPACT ANY EXISTING RIGHTS OR REMEDIES. AB THIRTY FIVE WOULD RECALL REQUIRES SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS TO DISCLOSE WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE A POLICY IN PLACE TO ADDRESS THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION THAT COULD LEAD. TO PHYSICAL HARM. HAS VERIFIABLE IN AUTHENTIC CONTENT AND PRACTICES TO DECEPTIVELY MANIPULATE OR DISRUPT THE BEHAVIOR OF USERS. SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS FORM AN INTEGRAL PART OF HOW U. S. ADULTS CONSUME NEWS. ACCORDING TO THE PEW RESEARCH CENTER IN 202053% OF U. S. ADULTS GOT THEIR NEWS FROM SOCIAL MEDIA. ALTERNATIVELY IS THE TO START REPORTED IN TWENTY NINETEEN THAT APPROXIMATELY 50% OF PEOPLE SHARE A NEW STORY ONLY TO FIND OUT LATER THAT THIS NEWS STORY WAS FALSE. RESEARCHERS AT UC SAN FRANCISCO FOUND THAT AFTER FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP TWEETED CHINESE VIRUS ON TOP WHEN TALKING ABOUT COVERT NINETEEN THE NUMBER OF TWEAKS THAT USED THAT PHRASE ROSE BY 8000310051% SINCE MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY VIOLENT ATTACKS AGAINST THE ASIAN AMERICANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS OUR COMMUNITY HAS SKYROCKETED IN LARGE PART BECAUSE OF MISINFORMATION. CALIFORNIA SO CONSUMERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW THE FACTS OF WHAT SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS ARE DOING TO STOP THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION. SOME MAJOR PLATFORMS OF MADE A GOOD FAITH EFFORT IN COMMUNICATING WITH THEIR USERS AND THE PUBLIC ON THEIR EFFORTS IN COMBATING THE SPREAD OF MYTHS MISINFORMATION. HOWEVER IT'S NOT CLEAR IF ALL PLATFORMS TO DOING THIS AS WELL AB THIRTY FIVE WOULD REQUIRE THE PLATFORMS- MAKE THOSE DISCLOSURES TO THEIR CONSUMERS THE BILL DOES NOT DIRECT DIRECT HOW PLATFORM SHOULD CURATE THEIR CONTENT IT ONLY REQUIRES THE PLATFORMS TO GIVE A DISCLOSURE. AND MAKE IT EASILY ACCESSIBLE TO THE PUBLIC THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY COUNTY COUNCIL OR CITY ATTORNEY WILL HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE THIS STATUTE. IF AFTER-RECEIVING THE NOTICE THE PLATFORM DOESN'T POST A POLICY THEY WILL BE SUBJECT TO A ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS A DAY PENALTY. AB THIRTY FIVE IS NOT ONEROUS- REQUIREMENT ON PLATFORMS BUT IT IT IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IN STOPPING THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR RIVAL I BELIEVE- I HAVE A WITNESS A PROFESSOR JOHN SIMS- TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU I HAVE TWO WITNESSES LISTED PROFESSOR JOHN SIMS FROM MICK GEORGE LAW SCHOOL AND SEVEN ATTACK ARE FROM THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA. PROFESSOR SIMS ARE YOU ON THE LINE. YEAH MISTER THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THIS IS JOHN SIMS I'M EMERITUS PROFESSOR. AT THE UNIVERSITY OF THE PACIFIC SURE SCHOOL OF LAW. MY TESTIMONY TODAY IS AN ESTIMATE. AN INDIVIDUAL- BUT IT'S BACKGROUND I'D LIKE TO MENTION THAT I WAS A MEMBER OF THE LAW SCHOOL FACULTY. BETWEEN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. I FEEL THE SPECIAL HAS BEEN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND IN PARTICULAR THE FIRST AMENDMENT. YEAH IN MY VIEW NO SUBSTANTIAL CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION CAN BE RAISED ABOUT SB THIRTY FIVE. THE BILL DOES NOT REGULATE SPEECH. IT'S A CONSUMER PROTECTION STATUTE THAT MERELY REQUIRES PROVIDERS OF THE SERVICE FOR USERS ABOUT AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE MANNER IN WHICH THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM IS OPERATED. THE MANY DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS AFFABLE TO THOSE PROVIDING GOODS AND SERVICES AND FIRST AMENDMENT LAW ACCEPTS THIS EVERYDAY PROCESS OF REGULATION WHICH PROTECT AGAINST FRAUD EXPLOITATION AND OTHER INJURIES. AB THIRTY FIVE IS LIKE A REQUIREMENT THE ONE SELLING A NEWSPAPER OR MAGAZINE. THE SALE PRICE ON THE CVER OF THE FIRST PAGE. SIMILARLY ONE SOME SOFTWARE COULD BE REQUIRED TO INFORM PURCHASERS ABOUT WHETHER THERE'S A WARRANT. IN DEALING WITH EXPRESSION PROTECTED BY THE FIRST AMENDMENT THERE IS A REQUIREMENT THAT THE LOBBY MORE PRECISE THAN WHAT IS EXPECTED FROM RUN OF THE MILL LEGISLATION. NOW THIS BILL IS QUITE DETAILED. I AND MOREOVER IT DOESN'T REGULATE THE CONTENT OF SPEECH AT ALL. NOR DOES IT EVEN TOUCH UPON THE TIME PLACE AND MANNER OF EXPRESSION. THE FIRST AMENDMENT DOES NOT PREVENT CONSUMER PROTECTION DISCLOSURES OF THESE PIPES AND I AM CONFIDENT THAT AB THIRTY FIVE WOULD EASILY SURVIVE THE FIRST AMENDMENT CHALLENGE IF ANYONE WOULD RAISE SUCH AN ISSUE. AND IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CONSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS OF THIS BILL I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER THOSE OF COURSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CAR. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN BIRDS TO BE AN ATTACKER WITH THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTY FIVE THE TOPIC OF MISINFORMATION HAVE BEEN HOTLY DEBATED ISSUE FOR SOMETIME NOW DATA SHOWS THAT AMERICANS ROUTINELY RELY UPON NEWS GET OF MEDIA PLATFORMS THIS NEW FORMAT SOCIAL MEDIA BE POSTING.

CHOOSING THAT UTILIZE AND UNDERGO ASSISTIVE REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE CAN BE COSTLY. WITH SOME TREATMENTS AND PROCEDURES BEING SO COSTLY VICTIMS CAN BE HURT FINANCIALLY AS SOME PARENTS. USE THEIR ENTIRE LIFE SAVINGS TO CONCEIVE A FAMILY. THROUGH THIS METHOD AB FIVE FIVE SIX WOULD PROVIDE VICTIMS WITH THE ABILITY TO SEEK DAMAGES IN CALIFORNIA COURTS.

WHO WORKS IN THIS FIELD. THANK YOU- MISTER CHAN MEMBERS RESPECT THE REQUEST NOT BUT- THANK YOU MISTER MAIENSCHEIN. SO I HAVE ONE WITNESS IN SUPPORT LISTED SEVERAL LONDON FROM THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA THIS ONE ARE YOU ONLINE. YES GOOD MORNING MORNING CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN. THANK YOU A GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS TERRA ONE THEN I'M A PARTNER AT LIEFF CABRASER HEIMANN AND BURNED IN A LOCKER BASED IN SAN FRANCISCO. AND I'M ON THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE FOR THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA. I AM HONORED TO BE HERE WITH YOU THIS MORNING IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB. FIVE FIVE SIX. MY CAREER HAS BEEN DEDICATED TO SEEKING JUSTICE FOR THE INJURED INCLUDING THOSE WHO HAVE SUFFERED THAT DEVASTATING LOSS OF THEIR GENETIC MATERIAL INFERTILITY INDUSTRY FAILURES. I CURRENTLY SERVE AS LIAISON COUNSEL IN THE CASE ARISING OUT OF THE LAB AND BREEDER FAILURES THAT TOOK PLACE AT THE PACIFIC FERTILITY CENTER IN SAN FRANCISCO IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. MY CLIENTS ARE AMONG THE NEARLY SIX HUNDRED WOMEN AD FAMILIES WHO'VE LEARNED THAT THE AG'S AND EMBRYOS THAT THEY WERE ASSURED WILL BE SAFELY STORED. THEY WERE READY TO BECOME PARENTS. HAVE BEEN DESTROYED. OR AT THAT TO COMPROMISE. IT IS HARD TO DESCRIBE THE SHOCK PAIN AND GRIEF AMONG THOSE WHO LOSE PIECES THEMSELVES INFERTILITY INDUSTRY FAILURE IT IS EIGHT YEARNING TO BECOME APPARENT THAT BRING PEOPLE TO SPEAK OUT FOR KELLY SERVICES. ANY INDUSTRY IN HAS RAMPED UP ITS MARKETING EFFORTS IN NEED THAT THE MAN AND POLICY AGAINST BIOLOGICAL CLOCK. THE PROCESS INCLUDING PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY. WOMEN TAKE A COCKTAIL OF MEDICATIONS UNDERGO NEUMARKT LIGHTPATH PUBLIC EXAM. INJECTIONS WITH FORMAL THAT CUTS WELDING THE COMFORT AND CAN LEAD TO SEVERE COMPLICATION. THE PROSPECT OFTEN. AS AN EMOTIONAL ROLLER COASTER AND INDEED THE MAGNITUDE OF DESPAIR AND ANXIETY DURING. IDEA IS COMPARED BY PROFESSIONAL SPEAKING A CANCER DIAGNOSIS. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE FAMILY PLANNING GOALS WOMEN OFTEN GO TO MORE THAN ONE CYCLE ALL IN THE EFFORT MAXIMIZE THEIR CHANCES OF HAVING A BIOLOGICAL CHILD OR BIOLOGICAL SIBLINGS. AND OF COURSE ALL OF THE COMBAT A SIGNIFICANT. ANYWHERE BETWEEN FIFTEEN TO THIRTY THOUSAND CRITICAL. UNFORTUNATELY THE WOMEN AND FAMILIES TO PLACE THEIR TRUST IN THE INDUSTRY TO SAFEGUARD THEIR PRECIOUS GENETIC MATERIAL HAVE BEEN BETRAYED. I THINK ANYTHING INVESTIGATION FOUND PATCHWORK REGULATIONS AND SELF OVER QUITE A LACK OF CLEAR CONSISTENT STANDARDS AND ACCOUNTABILITY THERE HAVE BEEN TOO MANY INSTANCES NOW FOR FREEZER STORAGE EQUIPMENT AND NOW OF COURSE NOT JUST DURING CORRECT PERFECT GENETIC MATERIAL BUT ALSO BACKSEAT- HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE FEEDBACK THAT WERE BOTH KNOWN FOR THE COMPANIES AND INEXPENSIVE FIX BUT NOT RECALLED FIXED- WANTED. AND WE HAVE ALSO SEEN IN CLICK INTO ALONG ARE UP TO DOESN'T EVEN KNOW SUCH. ARE ADEQUATE TO A SHARP. CUSTOMER THAT ARE HAD BEEN AND WITH KEPT STATE. EXPERIENCE IS GATHERED. TO PACE GOING THE I. PROCESS. BUT AND HERE WE- IS THE- ALSO BY FAR TO FAMILY. DONOR KIRKLAND A SIXTY WEEK MEDICINE PHYSICIAN KNOWINGLY. THE FIRM OVER. SELECT BY THE PATIENT WITH THAT OF ANOTHER. IT HAPPENED WITHOUT THE PATIENT CAN AND SOMETIMES EVEN IF WITH THE YOU A STAMP OF THEIR- IN THE PROCESS. THE FACT THAT WOMEN UNDERGO A COOLING PROPERTY. MUST PLACE FULL TRUST IN THAT AND YET EIGHT RISK OF BEING THE BY THE VERY PEAK THEY PLAY THEIR TRUST IN. IF NOTHING SHORT OF ABHORRENT. MANY OF THESE PROBLEMS JUST DO NOT COME LIGHT BECAUSE FOURTH CLAUSES THAT DELAY OR ELIMINATE ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY AND MANY FERTILITY COMPANIES ARE PRIVATE BUSINESS ENTITIES THAT OPERATE OUTSIDE OF OUR MEDICAL SYSTEM THEY DO NOT EVEN HAVE A REQUIREMENT TO CARRY A MINIMUM LEVEL OF INSURANCE. ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS HIGHLIGHT HOW THE INDUSTRY IS RIPE FOR FRAUD AND ABUSE. AB FIVE FIVE SIX RECOGNIZES THAT THE LITTLE REMEDIES ARE NEEDED FOR THE DEVASTATING HIGHLY PERSONAL AND EMOTIONAL LOSSES. CAUSED BY DONOR BROADBAND FACILITY INDUSTRY FAILURE. MEASURES LIKE. FIVE FIVE OUR CRITICAL DEJECTED AND PUBLICLY ACCOUNT. FOR AND WE SUPPORT THE DELTA CREDIT STEP TOWARD IMPROVING IN THIS.
