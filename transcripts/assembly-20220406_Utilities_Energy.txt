EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN SIX NINE TWO EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN. AND THE ACCESS CODE NUMBER IS. ONE THREE ONE FIVE FOUR THREE SEVEN THE- VICE CHAIR WILL NOW- RESUME WITH ME. AND SIX WAS STATE HAS MADE SOME TREMENDOUS STRIDES IN MEETING OUR RENEWABLE ENERGY GOALS CLOSER WE GET TO THE TWENTY FORTY FIVE DEADLINE THE MORE DIFFICULT IT WILL BE TO REACH THESE GOALS ONE OF THESE DIFFICULTIES IS A NEED TO BOLSTER AND EXPAND OUR ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING THE BUILD OUT OF TRANSMISSION FACILITIES THE PROCESS OF CONSTRUCTING NEW TRANSMISSION LINES IS BOTH TIMELY AND COSTLY. THESE PROJECTS CAN TAKE UP TO A DECADE A PERMIT AND BUILD AND THE TOTAL PRICE TAG TO BUILD UP IS NECESSARY AND ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE WOULD RESULT IN BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WHICH COULD BE PASSED ON TO RATEPAYERS CALIFORNIA IS FALLING BEHIND IN PLANNING AND BUILDING THE ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION. FACILITIES NEEDED TO MEET OUR CLEAN ENERGY AND CLIMATE TARGETS THIS BILL WOULD LEAD TO ALTERNATIVE FUNDING MECHANISMS WHILE ALIGNING THE TRANSMISSION PLANNING PROCESS WITH OUR GHG REDUCTION GOALS WHILE ENSURING CALAIS SOULS COMPETITIVE SOLICITATION PROCESS IS UNAFFECTED I HAVE TWO WITNESSES WITH ME TODAY BE DON WHITE THEME PARK CAMPAIGN IN JAZZ MONEY JONES. INDEPENDENT ENERGY PRODUCERS. THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF JOHN WHITE WITH THE CLEAN POWER CAMPAIGN IS VERY NICE TO BE BACK WITH YOU IN PERSON I'VE I'VE I'VE ENJOYED THE PROCESS TO TESTIFYING SO. I'M GLAD TO BE HERE. THIS IS A BILL THAT WE CAME UPON- AFTER LOOKING OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS AT WHY THINGS HAVE GOTTEN BOGGED DOWN IN- WHERE THERE MIGHT BE OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE SOME IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE FOUND A COUPLE OF PROVISIONS- ONE IS THE EXISTING LAWPROVIDES A- A PRESUMPTION OF NEEDS FOR TRANSMISSION PROJECTS. THAT ARE NEEDED TO MEET THE R. P. S. RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD. THIS BILL WOULD SIMPLY EXPAND THAT PRESUMPTION OF NEED TO INCLUDE. TRANSMISSION PROJECTS NEEDED OF TO ACHIEVE SB ONE HUNDRED. THE SECOND PART OF THE BILL IS A IS A STUDY BILL OUR STUDY PROVISION BY THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE BANK AND PC. TO LOOK AT ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF BUILDING AND FINANCING. TRANSMISSION IT DOESN'T SPECIFY A PREFERRED PREFERENCE- COULD BE PRIVATE CONTRACTORS COULD BE PARTNERSHIPS WITH FEDERAL AGENCIES BUT THE IDEA IS TO SEE IF WE CAN FIND WAYS OF REDUCING THE COST THE TRANSMISSION- SO THAT WE CAN. BUILD OUT THE NEEDED RESOURCES- WITH WITH LESS IMPACT ON RATES WE ASK FOR YOUR I. PHONE. THANK VERY MUCH- CHAIR AND- THAT MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CHANCE MONEY JONES FROM THE INDEPENDENT ENERGY PRODUCERS. AND THAT WE REPRESENT A BROAD PORTFOLIO RESOURCES- INCLUDING- UTILITY SCALE RENEWABLES US NATURAL GAS LONG DURATION STORAGE STORAGE AND INDEPENDENT TRANSMISSION DEVELOPERS. WE'RE SUPPORTING AB- TWENTY SIX NINETY SIX BECAUSE WE THINK THAT THE- ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO A ONCE THE ISO'S GONE THROUGH A VERY THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF NEED- THAT THERE REALLY IS NO REASON TO DO A NEEDS ANALYSIS AGAIN THIS WILL SAVE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME. TRANSMISSION AS I THINK THE AUTHOR HAS INDICATED TAKES A GOOD- SIGNIFICAN MY TIMES ARE DOING A NEED ANALYSIS TWICE ON THE SAME PROJECT MAKES NO SENSE. THERE IS SOME ARCANE LANGUAGE WITH RESPECT TO WHAT ELECTRICAL CORPORATIONS ARE OR NOT THAT WILL HAVE TO SORT OUT DOWN THE ROAD BUT NOT FOR TODAY- BUT WE'RE WHICH SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND WE WOULD URGE AN AYE VOTE. WE HAVE A. I WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ARE THERE ARE THERE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. I DON'T SEE ANY. GO TO THE PHONES. READY GO TO THE PHONES FOR A- THOSE WHO WANT TO TESTIFY AND IN IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION OF THE BILL. I'M AS MODERATOR WOULD YOU- CHECK THE LINES PLEASE.

CRISTINA GARCIA HOLDEN MAYES MURDER TUESDAY- MEDINA HERE REYES. SANTIAGO THANK RIVAS. QUORUM IS PRESENT JERRY WANNA CLOSE I THANK YOU FOR- YOUR ATTENTION ON THE MATTER RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. AB MEMBERS YOU HAVE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THANK YOU MMHM. I- WANT TO REMIND MISTER SPENDING JONES AT- AT A RECENT CONFERENCE I WAS JUST ASKING YOU ABOUT HOW WE CAN. TRY TO SPEED UP THE- THE BUILDING OF THE TRANSMISSION. INFRASTRUCTURE IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE OUR- OUR- HOPEFULLY. COMING ONLINE SOON- OFFSHORE WIND AND OTHER CLEAN ENERGY- GENERATION AND SO- IN THE THIS BILL- IT IS VERY TIMELY- BUT- OTHER THAN DECLARING THAT- ANY NEW TRANSMISSION TO BE NECESSARY TO MEET. OUR SB ONE HUNDRED GOALS. HOW IS THIS GOING TO ACTUALLY SPEED UP- THE BUILDING OF THE TRANSMISSION GRID. YEAH WHAT WHAT IT DOES IS IT BASICALLY IT'S YOU IT'S UTILIZING THE AYE ESOS- NEED ANALYSIS THAT CAME OUT OF THIS THE SELECTION PROCESS THAT WHICH IS VERY THOROUGH SO THERE'S ISSUES REGARDING IS IT NEEDED FOR POLICY REASONS THAT'S WHERE% WOULD COME UP. THE P. YOU SEE WOULD NOT HAVE TO RE LITIGATE THOSE ISSUES UP IN OTHER WORDS THAT SAVES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME BECAUSE I'M ASSUMING THAT IF PEOPLE HAVE OBJECTIONS OR DON'T THINK THAT THE POLICIES RIGHT WITH THE AND THERE'S- A FORM AVAILABLE TO RAISE THOSE ISSUES BUT AGAIN THESE HAVE TENDED TO BE A HIGHLY TECHNICAL OF THE DETAIL IN THE DIVIDEND AGAIN- PART OF THAT PROCESS IS IT'S COMPETITIVE AS WELL SO IF THAT LINE IT REALLY ISN'T NEEDED. THAT COULD BE DISPLACED BY SOMETHING ELSE THAT GENERALLY HAPPENS THAT PROCESS SO WHAT IT IS TAKING ONE EXTRA STEP OF THAT PROCESS TO. BUT IT'S NOT AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS INDICATES- INTENDED TO REPLACE THE COMPETITIVE BIDDING PROCESS NO OKAY THAT'S NOT THE INTENT IT. OKAY- AND CURRENTLY I THINK WE ARE WE ALSO HEARD FROM THE PC THAT IT TAKES ON AVERAGE ABOUT TEN YEARS TO- BILL TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS WOULD CORRECTIVE WE'RE TRYING TO TRUNCATE THAT PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY AND I JUST WANT TO EXPRESS IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT IF WE'RE GOING TO MEET THE GOALS THAT WE HAVE NOT ONLY FOR PURPOSES OF YOU KNOW CLEANING UP THE YOU KNOW GETTING TO A TO A GREENER APPROVED CARBON NEUTRAL- WE ALSO HAVE RELIABILITY AFFORDABILITY AND A LOT OF THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE TRANSMISSION SO WE NEED TO. BE ABLE TO MOVE THAT PROCESS ALONG A LITTLE QUICKER AND OUR HOPE HERE- IS THIS IS MAY BE ONE STEP OUT OF SEVERAL THAT MAY BE NECESSARY TO COULD HELP MOVE THAT ALONG. OKAY THANKS VERY MUCH. RIGHT THANK A GOOD QUESTIONS I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO BE HAVING AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING. THAT FOCUSES- TYPICALLY ON THE TIME FRAME OF- TRANSMISSION SITING BUILDING AND THEN OF COURSE COST THE ISSUE OF AFFORDABILITY RIGHTS ARE EXPECTED AS RIVAL PROVIDES CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE.

FORGERS THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENT SOMEONE LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE I KNOW THIS IS A SUCH AN IMPORTANT TOPIC THAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING FOR QUITE A FEW YEARS NOW AND I'M PROUD TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY ONE FORTY THREE WHICH WOULD REQUIRE PREVAILING WAGE FOR SOLAR PROJECTS OVER FIFTEEN KILOWATTS THAT OPT INTO THE NET ENERGY METERING PROGRAM AND WOULD REQUIRE THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE WITH AN ANNUAL REPORT ON ROOFTOP SOLAR ADOPTION. BY CENSUS TRACT IN SUPPOSED THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION IN KIT IS CALIFORNIA'S LEAD ENTITY TO REGULATE CALIFORNIA'S UTILITIES AND ACT ON BEHALF OF REPAIRS ON THE PUBLIC AT LARGE AND THEY'VE USE THAT MANDATE TO CREATE GENEROUS INCENTIVES FOR ROOFTOP SOLAR IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAS LED THE NATION WE ARE ALL INCREDIBLY PROUD OF THOSE EFFORTS WHEN STATE AUTHORITY IS BEING USED TO CREATE AN INCENTIVE THE BENEFIT SOME OF THE COST OF OTHERS HOWEVER IT'S INCUMBENT UPON THE LEGISLATURE TO TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AND MAKE SURE THAT IT PUBLIC BENEFIT IS BEING DERIVED. MEMBERS LET ME BE VERY CLEAR THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT MAKING CHANGES TO THE TERRACE OFFERED BY NET ENERGY METERING PROGRAM NOR DOES IT IMPACT SMALL SCALE ROOFTOP SOLAR RATHER THIS BILL DOES TWO THINGS THAT WILL HELP ENSURE ALL CALIFORNIANS YOUR RETURN ON AN INCENTIVE CREATED ON THEIR BEHALF IT IS THE REALITY THAT SOLAR INSTALLERS ARE NOT PAID AS MUCH AS OTHER ELECTRICAL WORKERS THERE ARE A NUMBER OF EXAMPLES FROM THE LAST DECADE OF LARGE COMPANIES THAT HAVE USED INNOVATION AS AN EXCUSE TO DRIVE DOWN WAGES FROM RIDE SHARE TO WAREHOUSE WORK. AND THIS IS ACTUALLY A REALITY THAT WE CANNOT ACCEPT AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO A CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY. CAN HAS BEEN A WORLD LEADER AND CLEAN GREEN ENERGY WOULD NOT ONLY INVESTMENTS BUT ALSO IN THE PLANNING NECESSARY TO GET TO ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. RENEWABLES BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE THAT BILL IS ACTUALLY SB ONE HUNDRED WHICH I CO AUTHORED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. MY FIRST YEAR IN THE ASSEMBLY. TE LEGISLATURE HAS AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO THE WORK NECESSARY TO REDUCE OUR STATE'S CONSUMPTION OF FOSSIL FUELS. AND THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF CONVERSATION REGARDING THE WORK FORCE IN THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY. AS THE STATE MOVES AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS THE NEW DRILLING OR FRACKING. INCENTIVES TOWARDS RENEWABLE ENERGY MUST INCLUDE A CLEAN GREEN ENERGY WORK FORCE. THIS IS OFTEN DISCUSSED AS A JUST TRANSITION BUT WHAT DOES THAT REALLY MEAN WHEN WE ACTUALLY THINK OF WORKERS. THIS BILL WILL UNLOCK WILL LOCK IN. A FAIR COMPENSATION FOR SOLAR INSTALLERS WORKING ON LARGE PROJECTS THAT OPT INTO THE PUBLIC PROVIDED INCENTIVES. THAT NUMBER PROVIDES. THE OTHER ACTION OF THIS BILL WILL TAKE ON AN ADDRESS A NEED FOR GREATER TRANSPARENCY AND COMMUNITY INCLUSION AROUND THE BENEFITS. THAT THE NET ENERGY METERING PROGRAM PROVIDES THIS IS ALL THROUGH A LENS OF EQUITY. RIGHT NOW THE LEGISLATURE DOES NOT HAVE GOOD DATA ON ROOFTOP SOLAR. UPTAKE IN NEIGHBORHOODS BY NEIGHBORHOODS. WHAT WE DO KNOW FROM UC BERKELEY STUDY AND THAT FROM THE PUC'S OWN REPORT ON AFFORDABILITY. IS THAT RATE PAYERS AND UNDER REPRESENT NINETIES ARE MUCH LESS LIKELY TO BENEFIT FROM THEM. THAT THE KASHIF MAKES THE RATE BURDEN HIGHER WE ALSO KNOW THAT 2% OF THE REBATES. OF THE CALIFORNIA SOLAR INCENTIVE UP I'M SORRY THE CALIFORNIA SOLAR INITIATIVE. WENT TO AFFORDABLE AND MULTI FAMILY HOUSING. HOW CAN WE ADDRESS THE DISPARITIES. IF WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT NEIGHBORHOODS. THEY ARE IN OR THAT THEY EXIST. AVAILABLE HERE TO TESTIFY ON HOW THIS BILL WILL BENEFIT WORKERS AND UNDER UNDER UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES AT SCOTT WHICH SITTING HERE RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME. RIGHT NEXT TO ME- WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE IS A ATION OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS MR MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBER SCOTT WHICH ON BEHALF OF BOTH THE CALIFORNIA COALITION OF UTILITY EMPLOYEES AND THE STATE ASSOCIATION ELECTRICAL WORKERS I'D LIKE TO FIRST ADDRESS THE EQUALITY ISSUE FOR THE COMMITTEE SCHOOL OF BUSINESS. PUT OUT A STUDY THAT FOUND THAT BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES HAVE EXPERIENCE FAR LESS SOLAR INVESTMENT IN WHITE COMMUNITIES EVEN WHEN ADJUSTED FOR INCOME. THIS IS NOT SURPRISING TO THOSE OF US WHO WATCH THESE PROGRAMS FOR SOME TIME I COULD CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS HANNAH TODAY HEADED OUT. YOU'LL SEE THE SLIDES THAT THE- HOUSEHOLD OF THREE MAKING A MERE FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PAID INTO THE CALIFORNIA SOLAR INITIATIVE. THAT PROGRAMS SPENT THREE BILLION DOLLARS. ON SUBSIDIZING BILLION DOLLARS WENT TO AFFORDABLE OR LOW INCOME HOUSING COMMERCIAL RETAIL AND MARKET RATE HOUSING. I CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO THE NEXT SLIDE THIS HAD THEY GAVE YOU THIS IS FOR THE NET METERING PROGRAM TO DATE. WE'VE DONE THE FIRST SLIDE WE'VE DONE JUST ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS IN ROOFTOP SOLAR UNDER THE NAME PROGRAM HOW MUCH OF GOING TO PORTTO PORT COMMUNITIES. LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED MEGAWATTS HAVE GONE TO SINGLE FAMILY AFFORDABLE SOLAR HOMES MULTI FAMILY AFFORDABLE SOLAR HOUSING OR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IT'S SHAMEFUL THIS BILL IS A SMALL BUT IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS THAT. I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO THE SECOND PART OF THIS BILL. JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO THE CALIFORNIA STATE CONTRACTORS LICENSING BOARD COMMISSIONED A STUDY BY THE UC BERKELEY LABOR CENTER. THAT PROVIDED A AN ARTICLE THAT THE QUOTES IT. THAT STUDY FOUND THAT THE AVERAGE SOLAR INSTALLER IN CALIFORNIA MAKES A MERE TWENTY THREE DOLLARS TOTAL PACKAGE. OKAY THE STUDY ALSO FOUND. EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT HIGHER WAGES DUE TO PREVAILING WAGE DO NOT SLOW SOLAR DEMAND WHY NOT INCLUDING STATE THE FIRST LABOR COSTS DON'T INCREASE MUCH WITH HIGHER WAGES AND BENEFITS. INSTALLATION LABOR REPRESENTS 6211% OF TOTAL PROJECT COSTS SO EVEN LARGE INCREASES IN WORKERS COMPENSATION DON'T LEAD TO LARGE INCREASE IN TOTAL COSTS IN OTHER WORDS A 50% INCREASE IN LABOR COSTS WOULD INCREASE TOTAL COSTS BY ONLY THREE TO FIVE PERCENT. THE STUDY FOUND THAT IF YOU APPLIED PREVAILING WAGE THERE WOULD BE AN INITIAL UPFRONT COST INCREASE OF THREE TO FIVE PERCENT. BUT SECOND FRONT THE SECOND FINDING OF THE STUDY WAS THAT THE IMPROVEMENTS IN WORKER PRODUCTIVITY THAT COME WITH A SKILLED WORK FIRST TYPICALLY OFFSET THOSE WAGE INCREASES. AND THE LAST LINE I'LL READ YOU SAYS IF A SKILLED WORKER PROVIDES 50% MORE VALUE OF YOUR PROJECTED BE THAT UNSKILLED WORKER WHERE ONLY ONLY 25% MORE PAY HIGHER COMPENSATION IS A SOUND INVESTMENT. THIS BILL ONLY APPLIES. TWO ROOFTOP SOLAR PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN SUBSIDIZED THROUGH THE NAME PROGRAM THERE ARE FIFTEEN. KILOWATT HOURS ARE LARGER THAT REPRESENTS ONLY 3% OF ALL THE NAME INSTALLATIONS. MY FINAL POINT YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING HOW BIG IS A FIFTEEN KILOWATT HOUR SOLAR ARRAY. SIXTY NINE PANELS MAKING YOUR OWN HOME. FOR YOUR HOME BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN SIXTY NINE PANELS THAT'S A BIG PROJECT REAR DRIVERS. THANK YOU WE'RE GOING TO ASK IF FOUGHT THERE ARE OTHER. MEMBERS IN THE AUDIENCE- SPEAKING IN FAVOR FEEL STATE YOUR NAME. ORGANIZATION IN YOUR POSITION PLEASE MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MIKE WEST ON BEHALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL ALSO IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY OTHER. MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE WANTED TO SPEAK TO THE WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES- TESTIFYING IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE COME FORWARD. TWO WITNESSES- YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES YOU GET TWO MINUTES EACH. FOUR FIVE SIX WHAT ARE WE GONNA MAYBE OR MAYBE LESS GOVERNMENT MISTER WHICH IF YOU'LL PLEASE- TWO WHAT SHOULD WE HAVE ANOTHER CHAIR HOW TO WILL GO WILL CALL IN BACK UP WILL YOU BE CALLED BACK UP. GOOD HELLO MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE CHAMBER- MY NAME IS KENNETH WELLS I AM FROM COME TO CALIFORNIA REPRESENTS THE FORTY FOURTH DISTRICT. I AND I AM A SMALL CONTRACTOR LOGIN MY STORY THAT I JUST WANT TO REPRESENT HERE IS THAT I OWN AND OPERATE A COMMERCIAL SOLAR ROOFTOP SOLAR COMPANY IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- IN MOSTAR JUST CAME FROM HUMBLE BEGINNINGS OF STARTING A SOLAR WHERE THERE WAS NO OPPORTUNITY PROVIDE FOR ME TO WORK IN THE INDUSTRY FOR ABOUT TWELVE YEARS. IN A TWELVE YEARS I'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET TO WHERE I AM NOW AND WHAT WE SPECIFICALLY DO IS WORK ON A WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT WHERE WE WORK DIRECTLY WITH PEOPLE FROM THESE COMMUNITIES WHO OTHERWISE. WOULDN'T HAVE OPPORTUNITY IN THIS INDUSTRY TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE GETTING THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT TRAINING THEY NEED IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS CLEAN TRIED TO TRANSITION TO CLEAN ENERGY. IF THIS BILL WAS THE PASS I BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD DIRECTLY KILL MY BUSINESS AS SOMEBODY WHO NOT ONLY HAS THE ABILITY TO WORK IN INDUSTRY BUT ALSO BE ENTRE NOR AND OWN A SMALL BIZ I WOULD NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO- MY BUSINESS BECAUSE- IT WILL PUT UNDUE BURDENS ON MY BUSINESS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE TYPE OF. COUNSEL IN THE TYPE OF PALM- I GUESS YOU WOULD SAY- WAIT. TO MY EMPLOYEES ARE THE KNEE UP. ALL MY- IF I WAS TO BRING HIM HERE SAY THEY ARE DIDN'T. WAY MORE THEY WOULD ANOTHER OPPORTUNITIES THAT COME FROM MY TYPE NEIGHBORHOOD. AND I HOPE THAT WE WILL TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION AS WE- ALSO TAKING SURVEYS ALL THE NUMBERS THAT ARE ARE BE PRESENTED TO. PLEASE HI GOOD AFTERNOON I'M COURTNEY KORDA I AM A CO OWNER OF COURT A SOLAR WE ARE AN EIGHT PERSON SOLAR INSTALLER IN DANVILLE WHICH IS ASSEMBLY DISTRICT SIXTEEN ARE WE HAVE BEEN INSTALLING SOLAR AND STORAGE SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER I WEAR A LOT OF HATS- LEGAL MARKETING H. R. I DO A LOT OF THINGS MYSELF AND ONE THING I WAS NOT ABLE TO DO MYSELF IT WAS PREVAILING WAGE I HELPED A FIRE DEPARTMENT GO SOLAR IN MY CMMUNITY AND THE RED TAPES TO DO THE SET UP IN THE PROCESSING FOR THE PREVAILING WAGE WAS SO TORTUROUS AND COMPLICATED THAT I HAD TO HIRE AN EXPENSIVE CONSULTANT JUST TO HELP ME DO THAT. IT WAS VERY BURDENSOME I DON'T KNOW HOW ANY COMPETENT SMALL BUSINESS PERSON COULD HANDLE THAT WITHOUT ADDITIONAL STAFF JUST TO DO THE PREVAILING WAGE PAPERWORK- THIS IS A SECOND CAREER FOR ME I AM DOING THIS BECAUSE I WANT TO HELP THE STATE REACH ITS CLEAN ENERGY GOALS I'M NOT DOING THIS TO MAKE MILLIONS I PAY A GENEROUS WAGE TO MY WORKERS WHO WERE ON SKILLED BEFORE THEY CAME TO ME I GIVE GOOD BENEFITS AND MY WORKERS ARE HAPPY- I- I FEEL THAT. I AB TWENTY ONE FORTY THREE IS A STEP IN THE WRONG DIRECTION I THINK THERE'S SOME FLAWED ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT HOW PREVAILING WAGE WOULD ACT BUSINESS LIKE KIND OF UNWIND I'M IT WOULD MAKE SOLAR A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE AND SLOW US DOWN JUST AT A TIME WHEN OUR STATE NEEDS TO TRIPLE AT LEAST THE SOLAR AND STORAGE THAT WE HAVE INSTALLED SMALL COMPANIES LIKE OURS ARE IMPORTANT TO THAT AND WE CAN'T AFFORD TO SLOW DOWN WE NEED TO ACCELERATE WE DON'T NEED TO BE DRIVING PEOPLE TOWARDS- FOSSIL FUEL STICKING WITH GAS GENERATORS WE NEED TO BE INSTALLING MORE SOLAR AB TWENTY ONE FORTY THREE WOULD PRICE US OUT OF THE MARKET IT WOULD. PRICE MY TYPICAL COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS OUT OF THE MARKET TO THESE ARE ORGANIZATIONS THAT DON'T HAVE PUBLIC WORKS BUDGETS THEY'RE NOT ROADS AND BRIDGES AS THEIR DENTAL. MY DENTIST MY A. R.

GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME'S GERALD WILLIAMS I'M A PROUD IBEW MEMBER CALLING IN SUPPORT OF AB TWO ONE FOUR THREE. THANK YOU. TWO EIGHTY SIX. HELLO THIS IS GREG KENNEDY WITH OCCIDENTAL POWER SOLAR COMPANY IN SAN FRANCISCO- OVER FORTY YEARS IN THE BUSINESS HERE- WHEN WE NEED PREVAILING WAGE WE HIRE- WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY IN PUBLIC HOUSING SOLAR AND HIRING FROM THE LOWER PRIVILEGE COMMUNITIES AND IT WOULD BE VERY DETRIMENTAL TO VOTE FOR THIS MEASURE IT WOULD PUT A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT OF WORK AND HE WOULD KILL A MARKET BASED ECONOMY NOT SURE I THINK. I THINK I'M GONNA I'M GONNA JUST A- REMIND FOLKS ADIGA BEEN PRETTY FAIR AT DINNER ONE ONE WHERE SOME FOLKS HAVE GONE A LITTLE WHILE LONGER THAN JUST THEIR. JUST ASK EVERYONE IF THEY'LL STICK TO THE RULES. NAME ORGANIZATION IN YOUR POSITION PLEASE THANK YOU. NINE TO FORTY SEVEN. OVANDO LINE THREE THIRTY THREE. HELLO MY NAME IS NICK THAT HE CALLED HIM A FULL TANK FELLER A LICENSED CONTRACTOR IN GLENDALE CALIFORNIA CALLING IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY ONE FORTY THREE THANK YOU. BLIND TWO FIFTY EIGHT. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS CHARLOTTE STEVENS MY MEMBER ID W. TWELVE FORTY FIVE I CAN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY ONE FORTY THREE. NO FURTHER ON THE PHONE LINES IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME. THE BILL THANK YOU WE HAVE A MOTION TO MOVE THE BILL- PRIOR SECOND. ARE WE WILL BRING IT BACK FOR QUESTIONS AND I'M ASK IF ANYONE HAS ANY QUESTIONS OF ART TO WITNESSES HERE OR THE AUTHOR AND THEN IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE- TESTIMONY THAT WAS GIVEN BY. THE PROPONENTS YEAH BUT- TOM. MISTER ROGERS CAN I. I'D LIKE TO ASK ABOUT THE- I REPRESENT CENTER CALIFORNIA THE FRESNO AREA AND AGRICULTURE IS UNDER A GREAT DEAL OF STRESS- WE HAVE- LOTS OF AG GROUND BEING FOLLOWED. OUR AT OUR- PACKING HOUSES ARE ARE TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO SAVE MONEY AT SO VERY LARGE SCALE- PROJECTS IN CENTER CALIFORNIA ON FELLOW DAG GROUND- THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS WITH RESPECT TO COST. AND ALSO ALMOST EVERY ROOF TOP. OF OUR PACKING HOUSES THAT YOU CAN FIND THEIR THEIR- ONE TO PUT UP MORE AND MORE AND- I HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH SOME OF MAGRA CULTURAL PEOPLE YESTERDAY ABOUT THIS- THERE IS A CONCERN THERE AND I REGISTER THAT CONCERN. ERA AND WOULD ASK- IF YOU WATER. RESPOND TO THAT- BUT IT IS A IT IS A SERIOUS CONCERN THAT GIVES ME PAUSE ON MY VOTE. YES MR VICE CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION. I WILL DIG IN PRO AFTER THIS HEARING TO TRY TO GET MORE. SPECIFIC DATA ON AGRICULTURE BECAUSE IT WASN'T READILY AVAILABLE THIS LATE TODAY WHEN YOU'RE STAFFERS AT EACH WITH ME. I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT IT'S MY BELIEF THAT THERE'S LESS NET METERING OF- OF SOLAR ENERGY IN AG BUSINESSES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THEN IN OTHER SECTORS. FOR THE FACT THAT WE WORKED WITH AND SUPPORTED QUESTIONS HE DIDN'T PPOSE LEGISLATION TO ALLOW AGRIBUSINESS TO SITE SOLAR ON THEIR FACILITIES. AND THEN WE'LL THE POWER IN BETWEEN VARIOUS DIFFERENT FACILITIES THAT THEY MAIL. WHICH WE RESISTED FOR A VERY LONG TIME US LIKE GALLO FOR INSTANCE COULD HAVE SOLAR VERY DIFFERENT MEDIA THEY'RE DIFFERENT YOU KNOW- WAREHOUSES AND WHATNOT. THE OVER GENERATE RIGHT HERE THEY CAN WE'LL IT TO ANOTHER LOCATION- SO I DON'T HAVE THE DATA SPECIFIC TO YOU AND SO I WILL GET THAT TO YOU BUT THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I CAN TELL YOU DABABNEH PRESET THAT. STRETCH- I WILL LAY OFF THE BILL UP. BUT WOULD CERTAINLY RESERVE A VOTE FOR THE FLOOR BUT I DO NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECT ON LOT OF A LARGE SCALE. SOLAR THAT'S BEING UP. PUT IN OUR AREA BECAUSE OF FALLOW AG THE WATER ISSUE. AND ALSO THE HIGH COST OF- OTHER ELECTRICITY- AGRICULTURE'S UNDER REAL STRESS THAT THIS IS A STRESSOR. ON TOP OF THE OTHER STRESSORS I'LL HAVE TO I'LL HAVE TO PAUSE FOR THIS AND IF I MAY RESPOND WITH- JUST A DIFFERENT VIEWPOINT AS WELL AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND I BELIEVE ALSO IN YOUR DISTRICT. YOU'RE SEEING A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS REGARDING THE SHUTDOWN OF FOSSIL FUELS AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE WORKERS IN YOUR COMMUNITY AND ACROSS A CENTRAL VALLEY AND ACROSS CALIFORNIA FOR STUCK IN A POSITION OF IF WE SHUT DOWN A CERTAIN INDUSTRY. THEN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AN INCREASE OF SOLAR WHICH IS WHAT WE ALL WANT IN TERMS OF CLEAN GREEN ENERGY. WHAT HAPPENS TO THE WORKERS. AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE WAGES AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE PENSIONS AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THAT KIND OF. SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE. SO THAT'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT YOUR COMMUNITY AND YOUR DISTRICT IS TRYING TO REACH WITH. WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF OIL IN MY DISTRICT. ARE WORKERS AROUND THE CENTRAL VALLEY I APPRECIATE THAT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT. AGRICULTURE BEING UNDER HUGE COST AND REGULATORY STRESSORS UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PUT OUT A OF. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS WITH RESPECT TO WHAT THE GROUND MANAGEMENT DATA IS DOING I MEAN WE WERE TELLING OUR AG PEOPLE DON'T PUMP IT OUT OF THE GROUND BUT WE'RE NOT GETTING THE SERVICE WATER TO PUT IT BACK IN THE GROUND. AND WE THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A HALF A MILLION COULD BE A MILLION ACRES FALLOW AND ALL OF OUR AGRICULTURAL PEOPLE ARE SCRAMBLING TO FIND WAYS. TO SUPPLANT. INCOME UP IT TO REPURPOSE AND ONE OF THE- SIGNIFICANT RE PURPOSING IS IN LARGE SCALE. SOLAR ARRAYS- AND I JUST NEED ASSURANCES THAT- THAT THIS ISN'T GOING TO BE OUT OF IN ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT ADD ON TO THE PRICE TAG OF FARMING AND IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA WE NEED OPTIONS ON THOSE GROUNDS. AT SOLAR IS AN OPTION ON THAT AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- THIS IS NOT AN IN INCREASED A DRIVER OF THOSE COSTS WE HAVE MANY OF. THE COMPANY'S LOCAL. THAT DO LARGE SCALE AG. AND I JUST DIDN'T HAVE NOT HAD TIME FRANKLY BECAUSE THIS CAME TO ME QUICKLY. YESTERDAY AND I'M DOING MY HOMEWORK. AND LIKE I SAID A LITTLE WAY OFF HERE TODAY. WE HAVE- QUESTIONS FROM SOME MEMBER SANTIAGO AND THEN- MISTER MURATSUCHI. FOLLOWED BY THIS HOLD. WHAT IF ANYONE ADDRESS MISTER WHAT IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR. AND WHEN ASKED HIM TO DO A LITTLE DEEPER MAYBE REPEAT SOME OF THE FINDINGS AND THAT UC BERKELEY STUDY- ON PREVAILING WAGE IF IN A AND I ALSO WANNA- I DON'T KNOW IF I CAUGHT THIS EARLIER BUT WHO ALSO PAID FOR THAT STUDY BUT PRETTY GOOD DELIVER DEEPER OUT OF PUSHING THAT- THIS STUDY WAS COMMISSIONED LAST YEAR BY THE STATE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSING BOARD. AND THEY WENT OUT TO BID AND THEY SELECTED THE UC BERKELEY TO CONDUCT A STUDY. THEY FOUND THAT LABOR COSTS OF A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL ROOFTOP SOLAR PROJECTS REYES BETWEEN SIX AND 11% AND THAT IF- IF YOU ASSUME THAT UP IT PREVAILING WAGE WOULD ACCOUNT FOR A 50% INCREASE IN LABOR COSTS WHICH IT DOESN'T KNOW DEMONSTRATE THAT A MOMENT THAT THAT WOULD THEN RESULT IN A TOTAL INCREASE IN COST OF THREE TO FIVE PERCENT. OKAY THEY ALSO FOUND THAT THE AVERAGE SOLAR INSTALLER IN CALIFORNIA MAKES A LITTLE OVER TWENTY THREE DOLLARS AN HOUR WITHOUT BENEFITS I JUST GRABBED SACRAMENTO REALLY WAGE RATE OFF THE DEPARTMENT INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS NO THIS IS A RESIDENTIAL INSIDE WIREMAN RAPES OF REBUILDING A SOLAR ARRAY ON A- ON A ON A HOME. THE PREVAILING WAGE RATE SACRAMENTO'S THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS AN HOUR FOR A FOR A FOR A RESIDENTIAL ELECTRICIANS. RIGHT HERE. WITH AN ADDITIONAL SIXTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR GOING TO HEALTH AND WELFARE OF PENSION AND TRAINING- HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION. THE COMPUTER THE OPPOSITION STATED A DIFFERENT NUMBER THAT WAS A LITTLE OUT OF LINE WITH WHAT I'VE HEARD YOU SAY NINE OUT I DON'T THINK YOU CAN ANSWER THEM BUT IT GIVE ANY THOUGHTS ON RECONCILING THE TWO DIFFERENT. NUMBERS YOU KNOW. IT IT VARIES WITH INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES- IF THE FIGURES THAT WERE SHARED BY A COUPLE OF THE PEOPLE WHO PHONED IN WERE ACCURATE THEN THEY SHOULD HAVE ANY PROBLEM MEDIAN TO PREVENT A WAGE SCHEDULE IN IN IN THEIR AREA. I DON'T REALLY BUY THAT IT'S YOU KNOW UC BERKELEY DID A PRETTY THOROUGH STUDY AND WE KNOW WHAT WE SEE OUT. IT IN IN THE LANDSCAPE. A. N. AGAIN THIS WAS NOT A STUDY DONE FOR THE I. B. W. THIS WAS AN INDEPENDENT STUDY PERFORMED FOR THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSING BOARD. A FOLLOW UP QUESTION SIR OKAY. WE WANT TO A MISTER MESSAGING. THANK THANK YOU- LET ME LET ME SAY FROM THE OUTSET I WANT TO MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT I. SUPPORT. A MIDDLE CLASS WAGE. FOR A ROOFTOP SOLAR INSTALLERS AND I SUPPORT A PREVAILING WAGE. FOR PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS. BUT AT THE SAME TIME I THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT WE NEED MORE SOLAR. ACROSS THE BOARD. ROUGH TOP UTILITY SCALE IN ORDER TO MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS AND TO SAVE OUR PLANET. AND SO I THINK THAT'S THE DIFFICULT BALANCING ACT HERE- HOW DO WE. TAKE CARE OF OUR WORKERS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME- INCENTIVIZE MORE AND MORE SOLAR SO THAT WE CAN CUT DOWN ON. FOSSIL FUEL USE SO THAT WE CAN. FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE AND SAVE OUR PLANET. I SHARE MISTER WATCHES GOAL OF. GETTING MORE SOLAR ON EVERY ROOFTOP INCLUDING BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES- ONE OF MY CONCERNS IS THAT IF THIS INCREASES COSTS ON SOLAR THAT IS GOING TO MAKE IT. MORE EXPENSIVE MORE DIFFICULT FOR. BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES TO GET SOLAR ON THE ROOFTOPS- AND SO I WANTED. TO MAKE THAT CLEAR AND SO LET ME JUMP INTO SOME OF MY SPECIFIC CONCERNS MY NUMBER ONE CONCERN. IS THE PRECEDENT THAT THIS BILL IS PROPOSING ARE BY. PROPOSING TO CLASSIFY. A PRIVATE SOLAR INSTALLATION PROJECT AS A PUBLIC WORKS PROJECT IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR PREVAILING WAGE. HOW IS IT THAT A PRIVATE SOLAR YOU KNOW INSULATION. BECOMES A PUBLIC WORKS PROJECT. MISTER WHICH- YES IS A MEMBER MURATSUCHI THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION WELL ACTUALLY THIS ISN'T BREAKING NEW GROUND IN ACTUALLY IT IS A CREATING A PRECEDENT. FIRST AND FOREMOST RATEPAYER DOLLARS TRIGGER PREVENT WAGE IN MANY INSTANCES FIRST AND FOREMOST. SB MUNICIPAL UTILITY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA EVERY PENNY THEY SPEND OF RATEPAYER MONEY ON PROJECTS REQUIRES PREVENT WAGE. YOU VOTED IN TWENTY TWENTY FIRST SIMPLY BILL EIGHT FORTY ONE BY YOUR COLLEAGUE MR TANG. WHICH SHIFTED THREE BILLION DOLLARS RATEPAYER MONEY IN ENERGY EFFICIENCY. TO THE FROM THE P. YOU SEE TO THE ENERGY CMMISSION AND REQUIRED THE PAYMENT OF PREVAILING WAGE AND A SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE. AND LASTLY PROBABLY THE GREATEST PRESIDENT. IS THAT ENOUGH. TWENTY FIFTEEN. A PERIOD WHEN YOU WERE HERE. THE LEGISLATURE PASSED SB THREE FIFTY BY THEN PRESIDENT PRO TEM KEVIN DE LEÓN TRANSMISSION PROJECTS THERE ARE PAID FOR THE REPAIR DOLLARS WHICH ARE ALL OF THEM. PAPERMAN WHICH. THOSE DOLLARS THAT WE SPEND ON TRANSMISSION. DWARF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE BY APPLYING PREVAILING WAGE TO ONLY THE 3% OF THE LARGEST ROOFTOP SOLAR PROJECTS ARE GETTING- SUBSIDIZED SERVICE TO WATCH ALL OF THOSE- PRECEDENT THAT YOU DECIDED. THOSE WERE ALL UTILITY SCALE PROJECTS. NO WHEN WE WENT WHEN YOU GO IN AND HAVE IT IN YOU YOU PUT IN A- YOU PICK THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECT THE MONEY THAT WE WOULD GET YOU VOTED FOR TO TAKE. FROM THE C. YOU SEE IN THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAM AND THINK AND- AND HAVE THE C. E. C. ADMINISTER IT. GOES TO ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECTS SMALL AND LARGE. I REMEMBER VOTING FOR A BILL THAT SUPPORTED. THAT IMPOSED A PREVAILING WAGE REQUIREMENT FOR THOSE TYPE OF PROJECTS BUT DID THOSE TYPE OF PROJECTS GET CLASSIFIED INCLUDING NON UTILITY SCALE PRIVATE PROJECTS ARE THEY CONSIDERED PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS. THOSE PROJECTS- WERE DESIGNATED PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS BY THE BY EIGHT FORTY ONE WHICH DESIGNATED THEM AS PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS IN AN ASSIGNED THE SPENDING OF RATEPAYER DOLLARS THERE. BUT THERE'S OTHER PRESIDENTS OF PRIVATE PROJECTS YOU VOTED FOR SB FIFTY FOUR WHICH REQUIRED THAT PREVAILING WAGE BE PAID ON ALL WORK PERFORMED AT OIL AND GAS FACILITIES. WHICH ARE PRIVATE PROJECTS BUT BECAUSE ITS OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY I GUESS THAT'S ACCEPTABLE TO YOU. IT WAS THAT'S WHY VOTE FOR THE BILL I SUPPORT PREVAILING WAGE FOR LARGE PROJECTS. BUT AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. INTEL THE POLICY BEHIND PAYING A PREVAILING WAGE ARE NOT AWARD TO PUBLIC WORKS CONTRACTS BY UNDERCUTTING COMPETITORS WHO PROVIDE- HIGHER COMPENSATION IT'S THE INTENT OF THE PREVAILING WAGE IS TO CREATE A LOT LEVEL PLAYING FIELD BY REQUIRING ACROSS THE BOARD RATE FOR ALL BIDDERS ON PUBLICLY SUBSIDIZED PROJECTS. WE'RE TALKING HERE. YOU KNOW YOU MENTIONED- FIFTEEN KILOWATTS- OF A PROJECT IS SIXTY NINE PANELS I HEARD I HEARD FROM. THE OPPOSITION THAT ITS IT'S- SOMETHING SMALLER BUT BE THAT AS IT MAY IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW SOLAR PROJECTS ON THEIR OWN LARGE HOMES AS WE GET MORE HOMES COULD BE COMING ELECTRIFIED OR ON COMMERCIAL PROJECTS. YOU WANT US TO CONSIDER THESE TYPE OF PROJECTS TO BE PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS. YET MISS RESEARCH A SEVENTEEN TWENTY OF THE LABOR CODE DEFINES PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS AS ANY PROJECT THAT RECEIVES THE ANY PROJECT WHERE THERE'S CAN DEMOLITION ALTERATION. OR CONSTRUCTION WHERE THEY'RE PAID FOR IN WHOLE OR IN PART THROUGH PUBLIC FUNDS AND THEN IT GOES ON TO DEFINE THOSE PUBLIC THOSE PUBLIC FUNDS IS ANY SORT OF SUBSIDY OF ANY SORT INCLUDING IF THEY IF THE CITY WAVES A DEVELOPER FEES OR GIVES A GRANT OF ANY SIZE. IT IT TRIGGERS THAT AND THEN THE LEGISLATURE HAS GONE IN AND DEEMED CERTAIN TYPES OF SUBSIDIES. TO TRIGGER PREVAILING WAGE AND WHAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS BILL SUGGESTS HERE IS IF A LARGE SCALE ROOFTOP SOLAR PROJECT IS RECEIVING. SUBSIDIES OF WHICH THESE PROJECTS ARE RECEIVING MULTIPLE TYPES OF SUBSIDIES BUT IN THIS CASE ANNAM SUBSIDY. THAT THAT SHOULD TRIGGER PREVAILING WAGE OKAY SO FOLLOWING ON THAT POINT. IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SUBSIDIES OF PUBLIC FUNDS. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT BE MA'AM TARIFF. IS NOT A PUBLIC FUND BUT IT'S WHAT. THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL AND OTHERS HAVE CALLED THE COST SHIFT YOUR IN OTHER WORDS IT'S RATE PAYERS THAT PAY NOT PUBLIC FUNDS AND YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY 1100% CORRECT IT'S RATE PAYER MONIES. JUST LIKE THE THREE INSTANCES THAT I OUTLINED WHERE THIS LEGISLATURE IN ITS WISDOM DECIDED TO SAY THAT RATEPAYER MONEY GOING FOR THAT PURPOSE SHOULD BE PAID SHOULD SHOULD BE COVERED BY PREVAILING WAGE TRANSMISSION IN AB EIGHT FORTY ONE AND THEN OF COURSE THE FACT THAT ALL WORK DONE BY MUNICIPAL UTILITIES THAT SPEND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS RATEPAYER MONEY ALSO TRIGGERS PROPERLY WHICH- MY CONCERN IS THAT. WHILE. THIS PROJECT IS TALKING ABOUT BETWEEN FORTY TWO TO SIXTY NINE PANELS IN ORDER TO GENERATE A LOAD OF FIFTEEN KILOWATTS- WHAT IS TO STOP. THE NEXT BILL TO GO AFTER ALL SOLAR PROJECTS TO BE CLASSIFIED AS PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS. THAT CERTAINLY BE YOUR PER PROVOCATIVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CONCERN I'D LIKE TO- ASK A AND THE OPPOSITION. WHAT IS THE TYPICAL- LOAD- SOLAR PROJECT- IT AND THE LOW TAT A SERVICE FOR YOUR YOUR YOUR TYPICAL HOME. THANK YOU THAT'S IT I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER THAT A TYPICAL RESIDENTIAL INSTALLATION IN OUR AREA IS ABOUT SEVEN TO TEN KILOWATTS- AND THE FIRE DEPARTMENT THAT WE HELPED GO SOLAR WAS THREE FIRE HOUSES FOR A TOTAL OF ABOUT SEVENTY EIGHT KILOWATTS- TO HELP. CLARIFY WHAT- MISTER WHICH SAID EARLIER IT'S NOT KILOWATT HOURS THAT SOLAR PANELS PRODUCE ITS KILOWATTS WHICH IS A MEASURE OF POWER WERE AS KILOWATT HOURS IS A MEASURE OF STORED ENERGY. SO A- SYSTEM THAT HAS SIXTY NINE PANELS THE NUMBER OF PANELS ISN'T WHAT WHAT'S IMPORTANT IT'S THE NUMBER OF WATTS PER PANEL SO ON A TYPICAL WATERS FOR PANELS NOW IS FOUR HUNDRED WATTS SO IF YOU HAVE TEN PANELS OF FOUR HUNDRED WATTS EACH THAT'S FOUR KILOWATTS. SO A SYSTEM OF FORTY KILL FORTY PANELS WOULD BE SIXTEEN KILOWATTS WHICH IS MORE THAN THE FIFTEEN KILOWATTS THAT'S PROPOSED IN THIS BILL. SO AND IF I MAY COULD I ALSO JUST MENTION AS A SINGLE POINT OF REFERENCE IN. COMPARISON TO WHAT MR WHICH HAS SAID ABOUT PREVAILING WAGE I HAVE A BRAND NEW A HIGH SCHOOL GRDUATE FROM OAKLAND MICHAEL ESPINOZA. HE HAS NO SOUL OR EXPERIENCE I PAID HIM TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR- AND WHEN WE DID THE FIRE DEPARTMENT PROJECT I HAD TO PAY HIM EIGHTY FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR FOR PREVAILING WAGE FOR AN INSIDE WIRE MEN WHICH SHE IS NOT- AND I WHAT. SHOULD BE IDEA OF EQUITY YOU'RE ADDING COSTS TO SOLAR IS NOT GOING TO HELP BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES GOT MORE SOLAR SO THAT'S A FLAW AND SECONDLY. THE PREVAILING WAGE SYSTEM IS SO ANTIQUATED AND COMPLICATED I CAN'T BELIEVE ANYBODY CAN USE IT DO YOU KNOW WHEN I WENT TO GO LOOK UP WHAT DO I PAY MY GUYS I COULDN'T FIND SOLAR INSTALLER I COULD FIND HARD CARRIER DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT HARD CARE YOUR IS. IT SOMEONE WHO CARRIES BRICKS FOR A BRICK WHERE. THERE'S PROBABLY CANDLE MAKE AND BUGGY WHIP MAKERS IN THIS LIST BUT NOT SOLAR INSTALLERS SO. I JUST I THINK IT'S IN. IT'S IN NEED OF SOME RETOOLING TO BE HELPING US MODERNIZE OUR GRID AND I THINK I'VE ALREADY. MADE MY OTHER POINTS ABOUT HOW WE PAY A FAIR WAGE AND GIVE GOOD BENEFITS PAYING AT A HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE EIGHTY FIVE DOLLARS. IS NOT FAIR THANK YOU CAN YOU FOLLOW QUESTIONS MR MUCH REACHING UP IF I MAY YOU KNOW JUST. ONE OR TWO MORE QUESTIONS SO. IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS PROPOSAL IS FOR- REQUIRING PREVAILING WAGE ON ON THE INSTALLATION OF- ROOFTOP SOLAR- OVER FIFTEEN KILOWATTS. SO IT SOUNDS LIKE ALL COMMERCIAL SO MY CHARITY MY WIFE HOMELESS SERVICES CHARITY THAT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED IT MY DENTIST WOULD HAVE REQUIRED IT THE APARTMENT BUILDING IN A LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOOD WOULD HAVE REQUIRED IT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT REQUIRED BECAUSE IT WAS A PUBLIC WORKS AND THEY HAD A PUBLIC WORKS BUDGET. BUT THESE OTHER CUSTOMERS OF MINE THEY DON'T OKAY SO I HEAR YOU THAT TO. IT SOUNDS LIKE. YOU KNOW COMMERCIAL OR PUBLIC OR BUILDINGS WITH PUBLIC USE LIKE NONPROFITS MAY HAVE EASILY EXCEED FIFTEEN KILOWATTS. DEFINITELY OKAY BUT BUT YOUR TYPICAL THIS WOULD NOT. IMPACT YOUR TYPICAL HOME IT WOULD NOT IMPACT A TYPICAL RESIDENTIAL INSTALLATION IT WOULD IMPACT SOME HIGHER END INSTALLATIONS. AND YOU KNOW YOU COULD MAKE AN ARGUMENT THAT- THAT THAT'S FAIR BUT I COULD MAKE THE OPPOSING ARGUMENT THAT WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO PART WITH THEIR CAPITAL TO INVEST IN. EQUIPMENT TO MAKE ENERGY TO HELP US ALL GO SOLAR IT'S THE PEOPLE WITH THE MEANS THAT ARE GOING TO DO IT. SO IF WE WANT TO PUNISH THEM BY MAKING IT MORE EXPENSIVE THAN WE SHOULD YOU KNOW GO AHEAD AND REQUIRE PREVAILING WAGE FOR A PRIVATE HOMEOWNER TO ADD SOLAR TO HIS HOUSE. THANK YOU HAVE NOTHING THANK YOU HAVE QUESTIONS FROM. MISTER HOLD. THERE'S A LOT TO UNPACK IT ALL OF THAT I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH I WANT TO DELVE INTO SOME OF THE POINTS HAVE BEEN MADE BUT I THINK THAT. I'LL JUST MAKE A- KIND OF A THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT OBSERVATION HERE AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR. FOR COMING BACK AND TRYING TO ATTACK THIS ISSUE AND IT IS AN ISSUE. AND I THINK IT'S CLEAR AND I'LL GRANT YOU THE POINT THAT- THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT PROBABLY NEED TO BE RETOOLED- GOOD- IF ONE WERE TO DIG INTO THEIR- THE CODES AND- ALL OF THAT YOU COULD PROBABLY SEE SOME OTHER AREAS- NOT JUST AT THE STATE LEVEL BUT AT A LOCAL LEVEL. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THE THING THAT I'M- STOCK. HERE IN MY MIND. IS THAT THERE'S A PARADOX THAT'S EMERGING. ONE WHERE WE'RE SAYING WE'VE GOT TO GET OFF OF FOSSIL FUEL. AND WE ALL AGREE WE NEED TO GET OFF OF FOSSIL FUEL. BUT IT'S ALSO INTERESTING THAT IS THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY THAT'S PAYING THE SAME WORKERS SIX FIGURES. IN INCOME A YEAR. AND WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT TRYING TO BRIDGE THAT GAP. THE AREA THAT WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE THE TRANSITION TO THAT INDUSTRY. OBVIOUSLY IS NOT GOING TO BE PAYING SIX FIGURES. BECAUSE WE'RE STRUGGLING AT WHAT PREVAILING WAGE LOOKS LIKE. BUT IT IS A STEP IN THE DIRECTION AND I'M NOT DIMINISHING SOME OF YOUR CONCERNS THAT YOU'VE RAISED. BUT IT IS NECESSARY TO TRY TO BRIDGE THE GAP. TERMS OF WAGE AND WHAT THAT MEANS AND DATA IS IMPORTANT I APPRECIATE THE OF THE- STUDY THAT UC BERKELEY HAS DONE THAT'S BEEN PRESENTED TO US THAT'S INFORMATION TO HELP IN PROCESSING I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING THAT SAYS TO THE CONTRARY ALTHOUGH. I TAKE YOUR TESTIMONY TO BE VALID ON ITS FACE- BUT THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS OF WHAT I THINK THIS BILL IS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH NOW MICHAEL BILLS THIS IS THE FIRST COMMITTEE. AND SO I'M ASSUMING AND I'M HOPING THAT CERTAINLY THE AUTHOR. AND THE SPONSOR WILL BE AMENABLE TO CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS I THINK THEY'VE ALREADY DEMONSTRATED THAT TO THE VICE CHAIR AS IT RELATES TO THE IMPACT ON AGRICULTURE AND- WHAT. THAT ULTIMATELY MAY MEAN TO THE BUSINESS SECTOR IN HIS DISTRICT. BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT BUT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO COMPETITION THIS IS THE SAME LANGUAGE. THAT WAS IN YOUR BILL LAST YEAR AND- GONZALEZ IS BILL TO ADDRESS THIS. PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE WE'RE WE'RE STILL DEALING WITH TO SOME DEGREE- CAUTIOUS- WITH THE NUMBER- OF GRAHAM- THE REGULATORY AGENCY IS GOT A DECISION BEFORE IT WE'RE STILL TRYING TO. WAIT TO SEE WHAT THAT YIELDS- AND SO I'M PREPARED TO SUPPORT THE BILL I'M- OBVIOUSLY- HOPEFUL AND BELIEVING THAT. SOME OF THE IMPORTANT POINTS THAT HAVE COME OUT IN THIS CONVERSATION CAN BE PART OF FURTHER DISCUSSION. AND I APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUES- EXPLORING IN PULLING. OF SOME OF THE LAYERS OF THE ONION BACK. OF US IN HERE STERN TO GET TEARY EYED AS YOU'RE DOING IT BUT- APPRECIATE THAT- BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT. A LOT OF WHAT- THE AUTHOR HAS PRESENTED IN HER OPENING STATEMENT. WHAT WAS MISTER WHICH IS. PRESENTED IN HIS OF DEFENSE OF THE PROGRAM DEFENSE OF THE BILL- HAS A LOT OF MERIT AS WELL AND SO. I'M PREPARED TO MOVE FORWARD. WITH THE BILL TODAY AND CONTINUE TO HOPE THAT THEY'LL BE CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN- OF THE PROPONENTS AND OPPONENTS TO. SEE IF THERE'S SOME OTHER ELEMENTS OF. OF MODIFICATIONS THAT CAN BE LOOKED AT AS FAIR AND REASONABLE AND- AN INTEGRATED INTO THE BILL IN SOME FORM. RIGHT THANK YOU I BELIEVE. WE DO HAVE A MOTION BY MISPRICED. THIS BY MRS FROM NAMASTE. BUT I WILL CONTINUE TO ASK QUESTIONS. SOPHISTICATES QUICK WITH A QUICK CAR WITH THE QUICK COMMENT I KNOW THE HOUR IS LATE AND- THIS IS THE AND I THOUGHT MY BUILD PRESENT TO SERVE. ON FIRST LET LET ME JUST TAKE OFF THE FOR BRING THIS BILL BACK ON THE LAST YEAR WE HAD A ROBUST DISCUSSION WITH. THIS% BECAUSE ALL HIS BILL AND AS SOMEONE WHO IS A SOLAR CUSTOMER. A BIG FAN OF- THE NET ENERGY METERING SYSTEMATIC IT WAS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO LAUNCH THE SOLAR INDUSTRY HERE ARE MILLION ROOF. GOAL WHICH WE DID HERE I BELIEVE FOR A YEAR TO GO. I THINK THAT THE VERY PROBLEM AT THE STATE HAVE HAVING SAID THAT. I THINK IT'S BEEN YEARS IN THE MAKING THAT WE NEED TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT HOW WE DO NET ENERGY METERING. I SOMEONE WHO SAW BENEFITTED FROM THAT PERSONALLY SINCE- TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN WHEN I INSTALLED MY OWN SOLAR INSTALLATION- I THINK IT IS TIME THAT WE TAKE ANOTHER LOOK. AT THE SYSTEM. I DON'T THINK THAT THE P. SEE OUT A RIGHT WHICH IS NOT A- BY THE THREE OF US TO BE ON THIS COMMITTEE FOR QUITE AWHILE. IT'S MUCH BETTER THAT WE TAKE A LOOK AT IT FROM A LEGISLATIVE POINT OF VIEW. AND I KNOW THAT. THEIR LOT OF STRONG FEELINGS ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS ISSUE I REALLY WOULD URGE HOPE THE HOPE IS THAT WE CAN. YOU KNOW THE PARTIES CAN COME TOGETHER AND REACH A COMPROMISE AND I THINK UNFORTUNATELY WE WEREN'T ABLE TO REACH THAT. OUT LAST YEAR- BUT MY HOPE IS THIS YEAR THAT WE CAN REACH IT. AND THAT WE CAN FIND SOME. COMMON GROUND BETWEEN THE INDUSTRY AND I THINK BETWEEN ALL THE COMMUNITIES WHO. ARE CONCERNED ABOUT. THE ENERGY METERING SO. WHILE I'M- A HUGE. FAN PROPONENT OF. NOT RICHARD MIDDLE SOLAR VERY EARLY CUSTOMER. EARLY ADOPTER. AT THIS POINT I'M- HAPPY TO AGAIN SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION LIKE I DID LAST YEAR. I THINK THAT THIS DISCUSSION TO BE HAD. COMPROMISED HIS BEHIND IT WE NEED TO- FORWARD AND I. THE AUTHOR FOR ACTUALLY SLIGHTLY ARE SLIM IN THE BILL DOWN HAVING MORE FOCUS. ON THIS BILL THAT I DID LAST YEAR. AND I DO BELIEVE LIKE- MY COLLEAGUES PASADENA SAID. THIS IS THE FIRST COMMITTEE I HOPE IS NOT LOST COMMITTEE I THINK THAT THIS DISCUSSION NEEDS TO BE HAD. AND I MY HOPE IS THAT WE CAN COME TOGETHER. ON AN AGREEMENT TO REALLY REFORM POT NET ENERGY METERING WHICH I THINK AS LONG BEEN OVER TO. THANK YOU SOME OF CHANGE I WANT TO SAY THAT- I'VE APPRECIATED THE- THE DEBATE- IT WAS A VERY WELL. BROWNED IT AND IN GOOD SPIRITS- FOR THE PURPOSE OF ESTABLISHING SOME GOOD PUBLIC POLICY- THIS ISN'T THE LAST TIME WE HEAR THIS BILL AND THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY I BELIEVE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED- BY THE- OPPOSITION WHO HAVE. WEST TESTIFIED TODAY AND- I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THIS BILL AGAIN. IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE AS WELL AS APPROPRIATIONS AND THEN. FOGGO'S ON THE FLOOR WHERE THAT COMPROMISE COULD BE PUT FORWARD HOW WE TWO ARE WAITING FOR A PC. A DECISION AT SOME POINT. AND SO- BUT WE CAN'T WAIT FOR THEM ANYMORE. AND I THINK THAT'S WHY WERE DELIBERATING THIS ISSUE- HERE TODAY SO THE THERE'S A MOTION A SECOND THERE IS A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION WITH THE AMENDMENTS- IN IF- DOES HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED AS A HAVE A AND ASK IF YOU WANT TO CLOSE. AND- WILL CALL THE QUESTION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU TO THE MEMBERS AND TO THE VERY ROBUST CONVERSATION THAT'S TAKEN PLACE- REGARDING THIS A PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THERE'S A LOT THAT'S BEEN SAID. OF THE PUC'S FAILURE TO ACCIDENTS TWENTY FIFTEEN IS A CONSTANT CONVERSATION THAT WE HAVE IN UTILITIES AND ENERGY. AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WAIT ON THEIR DECISION- WHICH CONTINUES TO BE. AGAIN THE GOAL POSTS KEEPS MOVING THAT'S ONE SIDE OF THE CONVERSATION. AS STATED MOST RESIDENTIAL SOLAR IS ABOUT SIX KILOWATTS. MAYBE TEN IF THAT. THE BILL DOES NOT IMPACT THAT. THIS HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH SMALL SCALE RESIDENTIAL SOLAR FIFTEEN KILOWATTS IT'S LARGE SCALE. THAT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT CONVERSATION. ANYONE THAT STATES THE PREVAILING WAGE IS AN ANTIQUATED MODEL IN WHICH WE- CONSIDER THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT WORKERS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. PENSION PLANS BENEFIT PLANS APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS WHICH PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIA AND SEEKING AN OPPORTUNITY IN A GOOD UNION JOBS. AS WELL AS OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN- INDIVIDUALS COMING OUT OF THE INCARCERATION SYSTEM TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A GOOD JOB. APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS WITHIN I. B. W. IN THE TRADES ARE A HUGE PART OF THE ANSWER TO. THAT QUESTION AND A HUGE PART OF THE SOLUTION SO PREVAILING WAGE IS ALREADY SOMETHING THAT CALIFORNIA LEADS ON A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT PROJECTS. AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS CONGRESS CONTINUES TO DEBATE THE GREEN NEW DEAL. PART OF TE PILLARS OF THE GREEN NEW DEAL IS TO ACTUALLY CREATE A CLEAN GREEN. ENERGY RENEWABLE ENERGY FUTURE WITH THE WORKERS ALONG SIDE OF IT. THAT CONVERSATION IS NOT A SILO CONVERSATION IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS BY ITSELF YOU CANNOT CREATE A CLEAN A GREEN CLEAN GREEN ENERGY FUTURE AN ECONOMY WITHOUT THE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY SUSTAIN IT. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THAT AND THAT'S WHY THESE CONVERSATIONS ARE COMPLICATED AND THEY ARE HARD THIS IS MY THIRD ATTEMPT IN TRYING TO MOVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS FORWARD WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THE CONVERSATIONS AROUND THE PC WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THEM. BUT THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO ENSURE THAT AT MINIMUM AND THIS IS HOW WE BEGIN TO MOVE OUR STATE FORWARD IS THAT LARGE SCALE FIFTEEN KILOWATT SOLAR PROJECT INCLUDE PREVAILING WAGE IF THEY OPT INTO. THE NUMBER PROGRAM THIS IS NOT MANDATED THIS IS IF THAT SOLAR PROJECT DECIDES TO USE THEM THEY WILL BE SUBJECT TO PREVAILING WAGE IF THEY CHOOSE NOT TO. THEN THEY CHOSE NOT TO AND THIS IS NOT APPLY TO THEM AS IT DOES NOT APPLY TO SMALL SCALE RESIDENTIAL SOLAR WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS BILL AS IT MOVES FORWARD YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT SOLUTION LOOKS LIKE ON ALL SCALES. AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. EDUARDO GARCIA EDUARDO GARCIA I PATTERSON- TO NOT VOTING BRYANT. BRIAN I CARILLO. CARILLO AYE CHAN AYE CHAN AYE CUNNINGHAM. ESTELA GARCIA HOLDEN HOLDEN I. MAYES OUR CITY MURATSUCHI AYE MEDINA MEDINA I REYES. SANTIAGO SANTIAGO I TING TING I RIVAS RIVAS I. THANK YOU ZERO WE'LL KEEP THE ROLE OPEN FOR OTHER MEMBERS TO ADD ON WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO WHAT WAS THE SECOND ITEM ON HE AGENDA A. B. TWENTY SIX SIXTY SEVEN. SO MEMBER FRIEDMAN. THE ITEM DOES HAVE A DO PASS. A COMMENDATION HI AND NOW TO A BILL WITH NO OPPOSITION MISTER BRYANT- AB TWENTY SIX SIXTY SEVEN CREATES A NEW INCENTIVE PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY CVC TO SUPPORT INNOVATIVE NEW APPROACHES AND DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCE ADOPTION BASED ON THEIR FUNCTIONAL ATTRIBUTES IN A TECHNOLOGICALLY NEUTRAL MANNER- THIS IS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THERE'S A DISPARITY OF AVAILABILITY OF INSTEAD OF SUPPORT- WHERE THE SOME CUSTOMERS BECAUSE WHO AREN'T IN A AND I OWE YOU TERRITORY IF YOU'RE A NEW TERRITORY YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE ANY OF THIS AVAILABLE TO YOU SO IN MY DISTRICT FOR INSTANCE FOR WE HAVE PO USE WE THE OPTIONS ARE IMITED TO ONSITE ELECTRIC ELECTRICITY DEMAND MANAGEMENT. AND SO WE WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY AND I THINK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR HELP TO TRY TO BRING MORE TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE TO ALL DIFFERENT USERS AND TO HELP OUR DECARBONIZE OUR ENERGY SOURCES- WE DO A BY A SUPPORTER TODAY CATHERINE ROTOR SUTTER WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND AND GREG RIDDLER WITH THE CALIFORNIA EFFICIENCY DEMAND MANAGEMENT COUNCIL AND I KEPT IT REALLY SHORT FOR YOU ALSO IF YOU ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS YOU'RE GONNA UNDO ALL OF THAT. BUT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER THEM ANYWAY SO WILL WILL- REMIND YOUR- WITNESSES IT YOU DO HAVE A- THE- PERSON SECOND WITH A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION ARE THEY HERE TO SPEAK. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE ON THE PHONE THEY MAKE A ON THE TELEVISION MODERATOR. ALL WITNESSES FOR A DIGITAL RECORDS THAT ARE ON THE PHONE. AND CLICK WHAT WAS ON THE PHONE AS WELL. ALL RIGHT PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU GARCIA MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- AGAIN THIS IS CAITLYN BROKERS BETTER SENIOR MANAGER CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND AND THEN HERE IN FAVOR OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN BILL AB TWENTY SIX SIXTY SEVEN- THE CREATION OF THIS INCENTIVE PROGRAM WILL HELP UNLOCK DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES FOR CUSTOMERS THIS INCLUDES TECHNOLOGIES TO ENABLE DEMAND MANAGEMENT SMALL SCALE RENEWABLE GENERATION ENERGY STORAGE SMART CHARGING OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES. CLEAN BACKUP POWER IN EVEN THE MOBILE POWER STATION IN THE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT ME- THE INCUMBENT OPERATES IN HE BILL WILL ACCELERATE THE STATE CLEAN ENERGY GOALS AND THEIR ADOPTION WILL ALSO HELP ENSURE RELIABILITY RESILIENCE AND EQUITY- AS YOU'RE ALL AWARE AGENCIES INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA CUTIE RECENTLY EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT OVER RELYING ON CUSTOMER RATE THE FUN NEW CLEAN ENERGY PROGRAM. AND THIS BILL DOES NOT UTILIZE REPAIR FUNDS AND WILL NOT IMPACT. COSTA RICA ENERGY BILL. I DO WISH THAT- ZERO BE A- ESPECIALLY MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY BE AND EMERGING CATEGORY IF YOU'RE ENERGY READ- WITH THE STREET COULD. OF THE ADVANCED ADVANCE CLEAN TRUCKS INTENDING CONSIDERATION OF THE BAND QUICKLY CRAWLED. ON CALIFORNIA'S REALLY PRIMED TO DECARBONISE THE MAJOR PORTION OF OUR ECONOMY AND USING FUNDS FROM THIS PROGRAM TO HELP ON LOCK MARC CHARGING OF THESE VEHICLES AND BY TREATING THEM AS A DISTRIBUTED ENERGY SOURCE. COULD BE TRANSFORMATIONAL AND COULD HELP FURTHER REDUCE LOCAL AIR POLLUTION AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS SO FOR THAT REASON. I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT SUBWAY PLEASE. YES GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR GARCIA MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS GREG WITH CLEAR AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA FISHING SCENE DEMAND MANAGEMENT COUNCIL COUNCIL WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND NINE AT THAT STATEWIDE TRADE ASSOCIATION MORE THAN SEVENTY NINE UTILITY COMPANIES. THAT PROVIDE ENERGY EFFICIENCY DEMAND RESPONSE AND DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA I'M HERE IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY SIX SIXTY SEVEN. THE CREATION OF AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM AB TWENTY SIX SIXTY SEVEN WILL HELP OPEN UP A NUMBER OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES. FOR ALL CUSTOMERS. D. E. OURS INCLUDE TECHNOLOGIES TO ENABLE DEMAND MANAGEMENT WHICH WHEN CALLED UPON. DURING THE AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY BLACKOUTS SAVE MORE THAN A THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF POWER BURNING FURTHER DISASTER. CURRENTLY UPFRONT PURCHASING COSTS AND COMPLICATED STATE APPLICATION PROCESSES CAN BE SIGNIFICANT DETERRENTS TO CUSTOMER ADOPTION AND GREAT BENEFITS. THIS BILL WILL HELP ENABLE WIDER SUBSCRIPTION OF THESE RESOURCES BY CREATING AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM ALLOWING RETAIL PROVIDERS TO APPLY FOR FUNDING ON BEHALF OF CUSTOMERS. THIS COULD RESULT IN THE RIGHT INCENTIVES TO EXPAND THE STATE'S CAPABILITIES TO STABILIZE THE GRID OVER ROLLING BLACKOUTS AND HELD A SUNBLOCK THE LAST AND MOST DIFFICULT PHASE OF MEETING OUR STATE'S CLEAN ENERGY GOALS.
