MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS AS A VICE CHAIR OF THAT CAUCUS. TO PRESENT TO YOU ACR ONE THIRTY NINE A RESOLUTION COMMEMORATING DOCTOR MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW DOCTOR KING WAS BORN IN JANUARY FIFTEENTH OF NINETEEN TWENTY NINE AND RAISED IN THE SOUTH BY A FATHER WHO WAS A BAPTIST MINISTER. AND AT A VERY EARLY AGE HE THOUGHT HE HAD THE CALLING ALSO TO BECOME A MINISTER. HOWEVER AS MOST THINGS DO LIFE CHANGES YOU AND AS A RESULT TO TAKE ON NEW CHALLENGES. SO THAT IN NINETEEN FIFTY FOUR WHEN HE WAS APPROACH TO IT WHEN HE WAS A MINISTER IN. AND AND MONEY IN MONTGOMERY ALABAMA AT EBENEZER BAPTIST CHURCH. HE THEN BEGAN TWO OF DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF SEGREGATION WHEN IT WAS BROUGHT TO HIM BY A GROUP OF CITIZENS. THAT ROSA PARKS HAD BEEN THROWN OFF THE BUS. AND THAT IT WAS NOW TIME FOR PEOPLE TO THINK ABOUT THE ISSUE OF SEGREGATION AND JIM CROW LAWS THAT HAVE EXISTED IN THIS COUNTRY. FOR CENTURY. DOCTOR KING WAS ONLY TWENTY SIX YEARS OLD WHEN HE DECIDED THAT THIS WAS HIS WORK. THAT HE WOULD TAKE UP THIS ENORMOUS CHALLENGE. IN THE END THE ERA OF TREMENDOUS RACISM AND AND LYNCHINGS AND BURNINGS AND INTIMIDATION. DOCTOR KING DECIDED THAT THIS WAS WORTH DEDICATING HIS LIFE TO. ENGAGED IN THE MOST SUCCESSFUL BOYCOTT. WELL BEFORE OVER THIRTEEN MONTHS IN MONTGOMERY ALABAMA. THAT BASICALLY BROKE THE BACK OF SEGREGATION BUSES. AND INTEGRATED THE BUS SYSTEM IN MONTGOMERY. THAT PROPELLED HIM FORWARD AS A AS A LEADER. AND THIS NATION IN THE AREA OF CIVIL RIGHTS. AND THEY FOUGHT THEN INFORM THE MONTGOMERY IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION. AND BEGIN AT THAT POINT TO TALK ABOUT ALL THE OTHER AREAS OF. SEGREGATION AND DISCRIMINATION IN THIS NATION. MUCH OF YOU REMEMBER HIS GREAT SPEECH IN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE THAT I HAVE A DREAM. WE'RE OVER A QUARTER MILLION PEOPLE CAME TO WASHINGTON. A PROTEST AGAINST SEGREGATION IN THIS NATION. IT RESULTED IN THE PASSAGE OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR. AND THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE. IN THIRTEEN YEARS THIS YOUNG MAN CHANGE THE DIRECTION AND THE LIFE IN THE CULTURE OF THIS COUNTRY. AND THERE WAS A EFFORT INITIALLY TO. OBVIOUSLY GIVE HIM A CELEBRATION OF EARTH DAY. OF THAT IT WAS RESISTED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS THAT WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF CALIFORNIA. THAT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY CALIFORNIA BECAMETHE FIRST STATE TO ACTUALLY HAVE A MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR CELEBRATION AND HOLIDAY AND ALL OF ITS SCHOOLS AND PUBLIC FACILITIES. SO WE'RE HERE TODAY TO COMMEMORATE THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF DOCTOR KING. AND AS WE THINK ABOUT THAT DOCTOR KING WOULD HAVE BEEN EIGHTY NINE YEARS OLD ON MONDAY. HE LIVED WELL HE'S BEEN DEAD LONGER THEN HE LIVED. IN TERMS OF DYING AT THE AGE OF THIRTY NINE. A YOUNG MAN WHO DEDICATED HIS WHOLE LIFE TO WHAT WAS RIGHT WHAT WAS JUST.

A DOCTOR KING LINKS TO. TO INDIA'S INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT ARE WELL DOCUMENTED. FROM THE EARLY DAYS THE MONTGOMERY BUS BOYCOTT KING REFERRED TO INDIA'S MAHATMA GANDHI AS THE GUIDING LIGHT OF THE TECHNIQUE. OF NONVIOLENT SOCIAL CHANGE. A FEW YEARS LATER IN NINETEEN FIFTY NINE DOCTOR KING AND HIS WIFE CORETTA SCOTT KING TRAVEL TO INDIA FOR A FIVE WEEK VISIT FOR THE SPECIFIC PURPOSE. OF DR KING LEARNING MORE ABOUT NON VIOLENT NON COOPERATION AND CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE. UPON ARRIVAL HE'S YOU KNOW HE'S NOT HE'S QUOTED AS SAYING TO OTHER COUNTRIES I MAKE GOES THE TOURISTS BUT INDIA I COME AS A PILGRIM. IN ENDING HIS TRIP A DOCTOR DOCTOR KING. SAID SINCE BEING IN INDIA I AM MORE CONVINCED THAN EVER BEFORE THAT THE METHOD OF NONVIOLENT RESISTANCE IS THE MOST POTENT WEAPON AVAILABLE TO OPPRESSED PEOPLE. IN THEIR STRUGGLE FOR JUSTICE AND HUMAN DIGNITY. WE HAVE LEADERS LIKE DOUGHERTY THINK DOCTOR KING TO THANK FOR AS HE WAS AMONG THOSE WHO IGNITED A FIRE. THAT INSPIRES CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS SUCH AS YOU RECALL CHIOMA IN HER FIGHT FOR TRUTH AND SOCIAL JUSTICE.

OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT TO ALLOW. BOOK POKES HIM ALL OVER THE WORLD TO COME TO THIS COUNTRY TO SEEK THE AMERICAN DREAM. AND IN DOCTOR KING'S FINALS FINAL WEEKS AND PUSHING THE POOR PEOPLE'S CAMPAIGN AND ECONOMIC BILL OF RIGHTS. OUT OF WHICH. THE MEMPHIS SANITATION STRIKE HE INDICATED WAS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF. NOW WE KNOW THAT HIS STRUGGLE FOR JUSTICE AND EQUALITY WENT BEYOND RACIAL EQUALITY BUT IT WAS A FIGHT FOR ECONOMIC JUSTICE FOR ALL PEOPLE IN THE POOR PEOPLE'S CAMPAIGN. WAS A MULTI RACIAL MULTI ETHNIC UP OF. OPPORTUNITY TO BRING TOGETHER STRUGGLING PEOPLE FROM AROUND THE NATION TO FIGHT FOR ECONOMIC JUSTICE AND I. IMPLORE ALL OF US TO REMEMBER THAT AS WE SEEK TO DO THE PEOPLE'S BUSINESS THAT BEYOND JUST CELEBRATING DOCTOR KING FOR WHAT HE WAS REMEMBER WHO E. STILL IS. AND ABOUT HIS MESSAGE STILL RESONATES TO THIS DAY FOR THOSE THAT ARE STRUGGLING ABOUT OUR STATE AND OUR NATION. IN THESE TIMES WHERE HOPE IS SO ESSENTIAL TO PROGRESS WE ARE TRULY GRATEFUL BEYOND MEASURE TO DOCTOR KING FOR HIS LIFETIME COMMITMENT. AND DEDICATION TO JUSTICE AND EQUALITY PLEASE JOIN ME IN VOTING AYE FOR THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE IN HONOR OF DR KING'S LIFE AND WORK. REALLY RECOGNIZE FROM YOUR DESK. SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS TO CELEBRATE THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF DR MARTIN LUTHER KING. TODAY'S COMMEMORATION. COMES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR TO STRAIGHTEN OUR RESOLVE. TO WORK FOR THE BETTERMENT OF ALL OF THOSE IN WHICH WE SERVE. DOCTOR KING WORKED TIRELESSLY. TO BRING CIVIL AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE TO THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN A PRICE OF. THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. HE WORKED ACROSS ALL COMMUNITIES HE REACHED OUT TO LEADERS IN THE CHICANO LATINO MOVEMENT. LIKE CORKY GONZALEZ AND CESAR CHAVEZ. IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX HERO TO CESAR CHAVEZ IN A TELEGRAM AND SAID. AS BROTHERS IN THE FIGHT FOR EQUALITY I EXTEND THE HAND THE FELLOWSHIP IN GOOD WILL AND WISH CONTINUED SUCCESS TO YOU AND YOUR MEMBERS. THE FIGHT FOR EQUALITY MUST BE FOUGHT ON MANY FRONTS. IN THE URBAN SLUMS AND THE SWEAT SHOPS OF THE FACTORIES AND FIELDS ARE SEPARATE STRUGGLES ARE REALLY WHAT. A STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM FOR DIGNITY AND FOR HUMANITY. IN THIS MOMENT IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY. AS HATEFUL RHETORIC SPEWS FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. I HOPE THAT EVERY CHILD WOMAN AND MAN CAN LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND SAY I AM SOMEBODY. I AM SOMEBODY. MEMBERS. LET US REALIZE. THE DREAM OF MARTIN LUTHER KING. A COUNTRY OF EQUITY OPPORTUNITY AND JUSTICE FOR EVERYONE. NOT JUST A FEW. AS I LOOK AROUND THIS CHAMBER. WE HAVEN'T MANY WAYS REACH THE MOUNTAIN TOP. AND OF CALIFORNIA. WE MUST NOW DELIVER. ON THAT PROMISE LAND. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR THURMAN YOU'RE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER IN MEMBERS I RISE ON BEHALF OF THE JEWISH CAUCUS. SUPPORT OF ACR ONE THIRTY NINE AND I THINK THE OFFER FROM SAN DIEGO. FOR HER LEADERSHIP IN BRINGING IT FOR. IS IMPORTANT TODAY THAT WE REFLECT ON AN AMERICAN HERO WHO WAS COMMITTED TO PROTECTING CIVIL RIGHTS. IN ACHIEVING EQUALITY. THROUGHOUT THIS YEAR OUR NATION HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO A RISE IN DEPRESSIVE RHETORIC. YOU KNOW PHOBIA INTOLERANCE IN DISCRIMINATION IN OUR NATION'S MEDIA AND THIS COUNTRY'S HIGHEST OFFICE. WE WOULD BE WISE TO CONSIDER THE TEACHINGS OF RABBI HILLEL. ONE OF JUDAISM'S MOST IMPORTANT THINKERS. HE ASKED HIS STUDENTS TO BE MINDFUL OF THE FOLLOWING THREE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS. IF I AM NOT FOR MYSELF. WHO WILL BE FOR ME? IF I AM ONLY FOR MYSELF. WHAT AM I? IF NOT NOW. WHEN. DURING THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. RABBI ABRAHAM JOSHUA HESCHEL MARCHED WITH DOCTOR KING FIFTY FOUR MILES FROM SELMA. TO MONTGOMERY SAYING THAT OUR CALLS FOR MORAL GRANDEUR IN SPIRITUAL AUDACITY. SIMILARLY OUR PRESENT MOMENT REQUIRES MORAL GRANDEUR AND SPIRITUAL AUDACITY. IF WE ARE FOR OURSELVES THEN WHO ARE WE. NOW MORE THAN EVER WE MUST COME TOGETHER AND DEFEND THE CIVIL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF ALL PEOPLE. THE JEWISH COMMUNITY IN THE JEWISH CAUCUS IS PROUD TO STAND WITH THE LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS IN THE MANY OTHER CAUCUSES THAT YOU'VE HEARD FROM TODAY. ON THIS DAY AS WE HONOR DOCTOR MARTIN LUTHER KING. AS I. AS I THINK ABOUT THIS MOMENT. IN. HOW PROUD I AM TO BE ABLE TO SERVE? IN. THE JEWISH CAUCUS. THE LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS. THE LATINO CAUCUS I THINK IT IS ONLY BECAUSE OF THE WORK OF SOMEONE LIKE DOCTOR KING. THAT A PERSON LIKE MYSELF. SERVE ON THIS FLOOR. A PERSON WHO'S. FAMILIES EMIGRATED FROM PLACES LIKE PANAMA. IN COLOMBIA IN JAMAICA. WHOSE ANCESTORS WERE BROUGHT HERE AS SLAVES THE PLACES LIKE MISSISSIPPI. TO A MAN WHO PRACTICES JUDAISM. IT IS BECAUSE OF THE WORK OF DOCTOR KING. THAT I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE IN THIS CHAMBER. IF I HAD A MESSAGE TODAY I WOULD I WOULD PARK IN THE WORDS OF DOCTOR KING. WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT THE FIERCE URGENCY OF NOW. HIS LEGACY LEAVES US WITH SO MANY CONTRIBUTIONS THAT HAVE MADE OUR COUNTRY BETTER. IN GREATER. HIS MESSAGE ABOUT THE ONENESS OF HUMANITY IS A SPECIAL ONE AND HAS BEEN VERY IMPORTANT FOR SO MANY OF US. BUT YET WE CONTINUE IN THIS PRESENT DAY. TO SEE SO MANY REMNANTS OF HATRED. IN OUR COMMUNITIES IN OUR SCHOOLS. IN POLITICS. YOU NEED ONLY TURN ON YOUR TELEVISION. TO HEAR COMMENTS BEING MADE. BASED ON RACE AND ETHNICITY. THAT WOULD DRIVE US APART. THAT HAVE IMPACTED OUR FAMILIES WHO EMIGRATE FROM ALL KINDS OF PLACES LIKE OUR NEIGHBORS IN MEXICO. OR ELSE SALVADOR. OR HAITI. THAT WE STILL SEE EVIDENCE OF THE KU KLUX KLAN. IN THE NEO NAZIS AS RECENT AS TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. LETS US KNOW THAT NOW MORE THAN EVER. ALL OF US MUST ACT IN THE WAY THAT KING DIRECTED. AND THAT WE MUST ACT WITH THE FIERCE URGENCY OF NOW THAT WE MUST LOCK ARMS TOGETHER. AND STAND AGAINST HATE AND PROMOTE. THE ONE THIS OF HUMANITY. I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. ON ACR ONE THIRTY NINE. THURMAN DOCTOR REGULARLY RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. YOU KNOW I HAVE TO BE A LITTLE CAREFUL WHEN I START SPEAKING ABOUT DOCTOR KING BECAUSE THERE'S A FEW PEOPLE WHO REALLY. GET TO ME. WHO SPEAK TO ME IN A WAY THAT FIRES US UP AND I BELIEVE IT'S BECAUSE DOCTOR KING WAS A BIT OF A SOCIAL ARSONIST? HE ACTUALLY BELIEVED THAT YOU HAD TO AGITATE AND CREATE SOME. ISSUES TO GET CHANGE. MANY OF YOU MAY NOT KNOW BUT OVER FIFTY YEARS AGO HE CAME TO FRESNO ONE TIME JUST ONE TIME. AND THE CAME BACK THEN BECAUSE HE WAS ARGUING FOR HOW WE NEEDED TO ADVANCE THE HOUSING ISSUES WITHIN OUR CITY. IT WAS JUST YESTERDAY. THAT WE WERE ABLE TO FINALLY GET A RENTAL HOUSING INSPECTION POLICY THAT WILL HAVE MET WHAT DOCTOR KING WAS STILL TRYING TO DO IT TOOK FIFTY YEARS. PROBLEMS THAT WERE HAPPENING IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT HE SAW BACK THEN ARE STILL PREVALENT NOW IT TAKES SOMEONE LIKE. DOCTOR KING TO STAND UP AND FIGHT FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. I'M PROUD TODAY SAY AND STAND FOR ACR ONE THIRTY NINE. BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT IN OUR COMMUNITY THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO WERE SOCIAL ARSONISTS WHO FOUGHT FOR OUR COMMUNITIES AND I BELIEVE DOCTOR KING NEEDS TO BE RECOGNIZED FOR HIS HARD WORK. I WANT TO SAY ONE LAST THING IF I CAN'T. WHAT HE FOUGHT FOR THAT INEQUALITY WITH SEPARATE BUT UNEQUAL THAT STILL OCCURS TODAY? WE STILL HAVE PARTS OF OUR SOCIETY WHICH ARE MARGINALIZED WHICH ARE WITHIN. SHADOWS. AND I THINK IT'S TIME FOR US TO HAVE A LARGER DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW WE DON'T LISTEN TO THE HATE RHETORIC. BUT LISTEN TO HIS LOVE AND OPTIMISM THAT'S A MESSAGE THAT WE AS A COMMUNITY NEED TO BE LISTENING TO RIGHT NOW. SO I THINK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE FORWARD HE HAS IMPACTED SO MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES I JUST WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU. WHAT HE DID FOR MY COMMUNITY? AND WHERE HE CAME AND WHAT IT MEANT TO ME. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. I CAN DOCTOR AND BELOW ZERO ANY FURTHER QUESTION A DEBATE ON THE MEASURE. SEEING AND HEARING ON DOCTOR WERE YOU MAY CLOSE. YES MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR COMMENTS AS WE. DISCUSS THE CELEBRATION OF DR MARTIN LUTHER KING AND ACR ONE THIRTY NINE. YEAH I WAS TRYING TO THINK OF WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY TODAY TO. CLOSE UP THE CELEBRATION. THIS IS PROBABLY MY SIXTH TIME SPEAKING ON THIS FLOOR CONCERNING MARTIN LUTHER KING. AND WHAT I THINK THE CAME TO ME IS A REALIZATION THAT COME THIS A PROBLEM THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN FIFTY YEARS. SINCE DOCTOR MARTIN LUTHER KING LIT THAT HE WAS ASSASSINATED ON APRIL FOURTH. NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT WHEN I WAS A STUDENT AT UCLA. AND THEN I REALIZE THAT PROBABLY IN THIS HOUSE MOST OF YOU NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY. TO REALLY SEE A LIVE PRESENTATION. AB DOCTOR KING. MOST OF YOU NOT FIFTY YEARS OLD. SO YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF HIM IS IS IS KNOWLEDGE THAT HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED DOWN FROM THOSE WHO WOULD BEER OR BOOKS OR ARTICLES IN NEWSPAPERS. BUT I'M NOT SURE IF YOU REALLY GRASS HOW DIFFICULT THE CHALLENGE WAS. IN HIS LIFETIME. AS MOST OF YOU NO I WAS RAISED IN I WAS BORN IN HOPE ARKANSAS MY FAMILY IS STILL THERE MANY OF THEM. BUT WE'VE TRAVELLED THEY'RE OFTEN SO I HAD THE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE KINDS OF. THINGS THAT WE THINK ARE WONDERFUL AMENITIES IN TERMS OF RACE RELATIONS IN COMPARISON TO THE SOUTH. BUT I TRAVEL TO THE SOUTH QUITE OFTEN. AND I SAW THE SIGNS OF WHITE IN COLOR. I UNDERSTOOD THE INCONVENIENCE OF TRYING TO FIND A RESTROOM TO USE AT A SERVICE STATION. I KNEW WHAT IT WAS LIKE WITH TO DRIVE FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND NOT BE ABLE TO STOP BECAUSE IT WAS NO PLACE YOU COULD STOP TO STAY. AND IF YOU STOPPED YOU WERE AFRAID OF WHAT YOU MIGHT SEE ONCE YOU LEFT CROSS OUT OF CALIFORNIA ACROSS THERE IS ONLY YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WOULD SEE WHEN TO BREAK REACHED TEXAS. AND BEYOND. AND SO I UNDERSTAND SO MANY OF US DON'T DON'T WE HAVE A SENSE ABOUT IT. BUT MAYBE NOT A SENSE OF HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS AND HOW DEEP IT WAS IN THE SOCIETY THE HATRED THAT WAS THERE. BED BUILDING BUILT UP OVER TWO HUNDRED YEARS OF HATRED. AND HOW THAT PERMEATED EVERY ELEMENT OF A PERSON'S LIFE. FINDING WHERE THEY WENT HOW THEY LIVE WHERE THEY EIGHT WHERE THEY STAYED. HOW FAR THEY COULD GO AND NOT GOAL A SOCIETY IN THE COMMUNITY? AND THAT BECAME REALLY A DIFFICULT THING TO TRANSFER SOMETIMES TO YOUNG PEOPLE. THE FACT THAT THIS BATTLE WERE IN IS A BATTLE IS A LIFE BATTLE. IT YOU CAN'T REALLY RELAX ON YOU CAN'T GIVE UP ON BECAUSE IF TO GO IT'S IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR THEM CLIMBING THAT MOUNTAIN OF DISCRIMINATION. TRYING TO GET TO SOME FREEDOM IN SOME JUSTICE AT THE TOP. KNOWING THAT EVERY STEP WAS DIFFICULT AND EVERY STEP MIGHT MEAN YOUR LIFE. AND BUT IT IS REAL EASY TO ROLL DOWN THE HILL. WITHOUT THINKING. YOU KNOW THE RACISM IN THIS COUNTRY. WAS BUILT UP OVER DECADES. WHEN THE FIRST SLAVES WERE BROUGHT HERE IN THE SIXTEEN HUNDREDS. THEY WOULD NOT NO ONE THOUGHT THAT THERE WOULD BE THIS. ENORMOUS SYSTEM OF DISCRIMINATION. AND HE WON AND LITTLE BY LITTLE LAW BY LAW ATTITUDE BY ATTITUDE. WE END UP WITH THE WORST SLAVE SYSTEM IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. ONE THAT WAS JUST NOT ABOUT AN INDIVIDUAL BEING SINCE LATE BUT GENERATIONS AND GENERATIONS AND GENERATIONS OF PEOPLE WHO OWNED BY OTHERS WITH THE RIGHT TO ABUSE OF MACHINES IN ANY CAPACITY THAT THEY THOUGHT. AND SO THAT HAPPENED LITTLE BY LITTLE. AND SO WHEN EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION COMES IN IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE. AND THE WAR ENDS IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE. YOU HAVE A SENSE OF FREEDOM FOR ABOUT. FIFTEEN YEARS. DOING RECONSTRUCTION. AND THEN LITTLE BY LITTLE. LAW BY LAW. ATTITUDE BUT ADDED TO THAT BEGAN TO CHANGE TO WE ENDED UP WITH THE NEW SYSTEM CALLED JIM CROW. AND I SAY THIS BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE THINK PEOPLE RIDE INTO THESE ISSUES YOU KNOW FULL FULL FLEDGED WITH THE PROGRAM IN A PROCESS THAT THEY CAN PUT OUT THE. WITHOUT REALIZING THAT STEP BY STEP PIECE BY PIECE. YOU BILL THIS IS THE SYSTEM OF DISCRIMINATION AND HATRED. AND SO I I RECOGNIZE THAT MANY OF YOU WERE NOT A PART OF THAT DIDN'T DON'T YOU GET IT BUT YOU DON'T YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT EMPATHIZING WITH BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY SOMETHING TO SOLVE THE TO LIVE WITH THAT YOU WORK WITH. AND YOU KNOW HOW PROUD WE WERE WOULDN'T WHEN WE SAW DOCTOR KING AT A RALLY ARE MARKED. AND HOW COURAGEOUS HE WAS WHEN HE CAME TO SAN DIEGO AND EVEN THE MINISTERS AND SAID IT WOULD NOT LET HIM SPEAK AT THE CHURCHES. BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID OF WHITE BACKLASH. AND SO AS A RESULT HE TALKED HE SPOKE AT SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY IN THE JAIL BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT LET HIM SPEAK AT THE LARGEST BLACK BAPTIST CHURCH IN SAN DIEGO BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID OF THIS RADICAL. WHO MIGHT CAUSE TROUBLE WHO MAY MAKE PROBLEMS A DIFFICULTY FOR THEM? AND SO WHEN WHEN I BEGAN TO ASK MYSELF AS WE LOOK AT THIS. AND SAY YOU KNOW THERE'S A GENERATION. THAT WILL DON'T YOU DON'T HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE YOU HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE OF. WHICH MAKES THIS DAY EVEN MORE IMPORTANT. BECAUSE WITHOUT THIS CELEBRATION WITHOUT THIS DAY YOU COULD AFFORD TO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT MARTIN LUTHER KING AND ALL THE STRUGGLES THAT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH. AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE AS WE'VE FACE THIS NEW CHALLENGE WE ARE NOW FACED WITH THE CHALLENGE THAT IS ENORMOUS IN THIS NATION. CHALLENGE TO TO BASICALLY BE AMERICANS. TO HOLD FAST TO THE VALUES AND THE PRINCIPLES THAT WE BELIEVE IN. THAT ARE UNDER ATTACK EVERY DAY AS WE GET THE HATE MESSAGE THAT SPEWS OUT AGAINST DIFFERENT IMMIGRANTS IN DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS. AND WHILE WE MIGHT BE ALL THAT SOUTH NOT SO BAD BUT THE REALITY YEARS. IT IS BAD. IT GETS TO THE HEART OF WHAT THIS NATION FOUGHT FOR AND WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE. AND IT IS INDIVIDUALS LIKE US. WHO DON'T MAKE STATEMENTS WHO DON'T ROCK THE BOAT WHO DON'T MOVE THE WATERS QUIETLY SAY I DON'T AGREE WITH YOU DON'T STAND UP AND SHOUT? YOU DON'T STAND IN YOUR COMMUNITIES AND SAY STOP IT. WE CANNOT HAVE THAT THAT IS NOT WHO WE ARE. AND SO PAYING OFTEN SAID IT'S NOT THE WORDS OF MY ENEMIES THAT BOTHER ME IT'S THE SILENCE OF MY FRIENDS. IT'S AFFECTED WE DON'T SPEAK UP. WE DON'T SPEAK OUT WE DON'T CONDEMN THOSE THINGS WHEN I SEE WHAT'S ON TELEVISION NOW WHEN I SEE CHARLOTTE VIOLA AND AND ALL THE RIGHTS AND THEN PLOP RIGHT NASH'S MOVE AND ALL THAT. I'M WONDERING WHERE MY FRIENDS. WELL MY COLLEAGUES WHO WANT TO BE STANDING UP AND SHOUTING IN STREAMING SCREAMING IN THE THE TO THE TOP OF THE VOICE. BECAUSE WE HAVE COME TOO FAR. WHAT TOO LONG AND TOO HARD TO BE PULLED BACK INTO THIS DARK THIS OF HATE? UGLINESS IN THIS NATION. IF SO AS WE LOOK AT THE DOCTOR KING DAY I AM HOPEFUL THAT PEOPLE WILL BEGIN TO SEE SOMETHING IN THEMSELVES. THE CAUSES THEM TO RISE UP. AND THE SAY NOT ON MY WATCH. NOT WHILE I'M HERE. NOT IN MY COMMUNITY NOT IN MY NATION. AND THAT BOTHERS ME MORE THAN ANYTHING BECAUSE OFTENTIMES YOU SEE THE THINGS THAT OCCUR. BUT YOU ASKED THE QUESTION WHERE ARE THE FOLKS WHO ONE FIGHT AGAINST IT. WHO DON'T BELIEVE IN IT BUT WON'T OPEN THEIR MOUTHS? AND THE BEAUTY OF THE MARTIN LUTHER KING CELEBRATION DAY IS THAT IT ONCE AGAIN REMINDS US. THAT ONE PERSON. STANDING FULL RIGHT. CAN TRULY CHANGE THE WORLD. ONE PERSON WITH A DETERMINATION TO MOTIVATE OTHERS TO JOIN THEM CAN CHANGE THE WORLD. AND HE OFTEN SAID IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING YOU'RE WILLING TO DIE FOR YOU REALLY HAVE NOTHING TO LIVE FOR. IF THESE PRINCIPLES THAT ARE TRULY AMERICAN PRINCIPLE. HOW WE TREAT EACH OTHER? HOW RESPECT THE VALUES THAT WE THAT WE HAVE IN THIS NATION HOW WE PROTECT OUR CHILDREN AND THE LEGACY WE PASS ON TO THEM? IS SO EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. AND SO I CHALLENGE TODAY TO BE THAT AMERICA AS AS THE BLOCK PORT ONCE SAID THE NUMBER WAS WOULD GET MUST BE. THE THE THE NATION THAT HAS BEEN THAT SAYS IT EMBRACES EVERYONE BUT HAS YET TO DO IT. BUT NATION THAT IS SUPPOSE TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR EVERYONE AND HAS NOT. I CHALLENGE JUST TO BE THAT NATION THAT WOULD THAT KING TALKED ABOUT. THE MOUNTAIN TOP EXPERIENCE THAT HE COULD STAND AND SEE THE PROMISED LAND. BUT MANY OF US I HAVE BEGUN TO WALK BACK DOWN THAT MOUNTAIN WHY BECAUSE IT'S LIKE IT'S A FAMILIAR TRAIL AND IS CONVENIENT. AND IT IS HARD WORK TO BE FREE. IT'S HARD WORK EVEN HARDER WORK TO STAY FREE. AND I CHALLENGE YOU TODAY TO REMEMBER ALWAYS. THAT HATRED. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T WANT. BUT JUSTICE EQUALITY OPPORTUNITY IS A RARE FLOWER. THAT REQUIRES CONSTANT TREATMENT AND NURTURING AND CARE. BUT HATRED IS WEAK. AND IT GROWS BEST IN NEGLECT. AND I ASKED TO NO LONGER NEGLECT. THE THINGS THAT ARE SO HORRIBLE. THAT WE SPEAK OUT. SPEAK UP. AND WE BECOME THE PEOPLE THAT WE BELIEVE WE ARE. NOT JUST FOR US BUT FOR GENERATIONS AND GENERATIONS TO COME. MISTER SPEAKER I ASK THAT THE FIRST WILL BE OFTEN OPEN FOR COAL AUTHORS ON ACR ONE THIRTY NINE. THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER. ALL DEBATE. ALL DEBATE HAVING SEIZED WE WERE MOVED TO VOTE ON THE MEASURE.

THE STATION IN FRANCE I WAS BORN THE TOUGH BUT THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT WHAT DOCTOR KING HELPED CONTRIBUTE TO. HOW CAME ABOUT IT WOULD HAPPEN THEY WERE SO HAPPY? BECAUSE GROWING UP IN THE SOUTH THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE. AND HOW IT WAS SO IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE DIED IN FOUGHT FOR THE RIGHT TO VOTE. AND HOW SHE ALWAYS VOTE AND HOW IMPORTANT WAS WHEN I VISITED THE NATIONAL MONUMENT I WAS BROUGHT BACK TO A SPEECH I REMEMBER READING OF DOCTOR CHANGES IT. WAS ENTITLED WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE WITH HIS LAST SPEECH HE DELIVERED TO THE SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE BEFORE HIS ASSASSINATION. IN THE SPEECH HE DRAWS THE CORRELATION BETWEEN POWER AND LOVE. AND WHAT HE SAYS IS WHAT'S NEEDED IS THE REALIZATION THAT POWER WITHOUT LOVE THIS RECKLESS AND ABUSIVE AND LOVE WITHOUT POWER IS SENTIMENTAL IN AN ANEMIC. POWER AT ITS BEST DR KING SAYS IS LOVE IMPLEMENTING THE DEMANDS OF JUSTICE AND JUSTICE AT ITS BEST ITS POWER CORRECTING EVERYTHING THAT STANDS AGAINST LOW. I'M. WHAT I REMEMBER MOST OF ALL GROWING UP AND WHAT'S? IS THAT WE WALK THROUGH THE DOOR. OUR FAMILY HOME. BEFORE YOU SAW ANYTHING ELSE THE TV THE FURNITURE YOU SAW THREE PICTURES. AND IT WAS SIGNIFICANT NOW IN MY HOME BUT WAS REPRESENTED IN OTHER PEOPLE'S HOMES AND THAT WAS A PICKED OF DOCTOR MARTHA KING. JOHN F. KENNEDY. AND JESUS. AND WHEN WE CAME HOME. THOSE ARE THREE PICTURES WE SAW. WHEN WE LEFT THE HOME. THOSE ARE THREE FIXES WERE SAW IT AS A YOUNG MAN I WATCHED MANY SPEECHES BY DOCTOR KING AND PROBABLY MOST IMPORTANTLY THE I AM TRIMS EACH I THINK I'VE SEEN IT ON. I COULD RECITE IT NOW I CAN GIVE IT NOW AND I THINK IT HAS STAYED WITH ME THROUGHOUT MY CAREER. AND THROUGHOUT MY LIFE AND I CAN THINK OF NO. PUBLIC FIGURE WHO'S HAD MORE IMPACT ON ME. ENDING UP. SERVICE. MILEPOST ONE REALLY ROCK NINE TONIGHT THIS INTEGRATED CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL MAKE. SEVEN. FOLLOWS ALWAYS TOLD ABOUT THEIR STRUGGLES AND THE STRUGGLES OF OUR PEOPLE. BUT MORE IMPORTANT. MY FAMILY TOLD US ABOUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH DOCTOR MARTIN LUTHER KING AND FROM THAT DAY. MY FAMILY HAS BEEN IN THAT SCHOOL PART IN CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. AND I'VE BEEN. SOMEONE WHO. HAS TO BE PART OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT BECAUSE THAT IS COMPARTMENTALIZED HISSY BUT IS WHAT I HAVE TO GIVE THAT. WAS BECAUSE THE MARTIN LUTHER KING LIE MEMORY OF DOCTOR KING IS MORE ABOUT MY MOTHER. A FEW WEEKS BEFORE HE DIED. HE SPOKE ABOUT HIS DESIRE FOR HER TO BE IN CONGRESS. AND WHAT GREAT POSSIBILITY SHE BROUGHT TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO ON MY DESK I KEEP THAT PICTURE. OF MY MOTHER AND DOCTOR KING AND IT REMINDS ME EVERY DAY OF HOW. LUCKY I AM TO GET TO WALK ON THE GREEN CARPET. HOW IMPORTANT MY BEING THERE IS NOT JUST TO MY COMMUNITY? BUT TO MY DAUGHTER WHO HOPEFULLY NOT UNLIKE MY MOM WAS AN ASSEMBLYMEMBER I AM NOW ON THE CARPET AND AND. EVEN IN LIGHT OF THAT CLAIM IT TODAY WHAT IS POSSIBLE FOR MY CHILD'S DOCTOR KING CAME TO PASADENA FRIENDSHIP BAPTIST CHURCH. THAT I REMEMBER AS A CHILD. THE LINE STRETCHING OUT THE CHURCH AND AROUND THE CORNER MY MOM. HELD MY HAND OF OUR BROTHERS AND SEE. MADE IT VERY CLEAR TO MY ON THIS YEAR'S GOING TO MAKE HER WAY THROUGH THE CROWD SHAKE HIS HAND SHE MADE HER WAY THROUGH. AND SHE REACHED UP AND HE LOOKED DOWN. AND HE REACHED OUT AND HE SHOOK HER HAND. AND YOU FELT THE POWER OF HIS PRESENCE. BUT ALSO THE TENACITY OF MY MOM. TO MAKE HER WAY TO THIS PERSON WHO SHE WAS INSPIRED BY AS WELL. RIGHT NOW WITH INITIAL DR KING NEVER WIN THAT CAME BEFORE US WHETHER THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE OR THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT FOLK THE REMARKS. A FIGHT FEELS RIGHT. IN THIS SCENE CIVIL RIGHT TO VOTE RIGHT TO BE A MAN THE RIGHT TO RIDE A BUS THROUGH THE COUNTER EACH FOOD THAT'S SO IMPORTANT WATCHING DOCTOR KING. AND THOSE WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT REALLY INSPIRED ME AS A YOUNG PERSON TO THINK ABOUT. WHAT COULD I DO TO HELP OTHERS AND I DIDN'T KNOW? WHAT THAT JOURNEY WOULD BE? BUT I KNEW THAT I WANTED TO HELP OTHERS AND I AS AN ADULT YOU KNOW I'VE WORKED ENTIRELY. IN THE NONPROFIT WORLDS. WORKING FOR AMERICORPS AND PUBLIC SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS AND. WE OFTEN VOLUNTEERED ON KING DAY I'VE ALWAYS. MARVELED AT HIS ABILITY TO INFLUENCE PEOPLE. WITH IDEAS AND WITH. OF THE POWER OF OF A GOOD THOUGHT IN THE WAY TO. TO MOVE FROM MATT HUMANITY TO ANOTHER LEVEL HIS LEGACY IS RICH AND IT'S INCLUSIVE. AND IT'S A LEGACY THAT WILL CONTINUE TO LIVE ON IF I CAN JUST HELP SOMEBODY. ALONG THE WAY. THEN MY LIVING HERE. WOULD NOT BE AND THAT I THINK ABOUT SO MANY PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY INTERCEDED CALIFORNIA THAT. YOU KNOW BUT FOR DR KING AND THAT AND PEOPLE IN HIS GENERATION. WE WOULD HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES AND AND GRANTED THERE'S A LONG WAY TO GO LOOK WE SEE THAT. RACIAL INEQUALITY AND INJUSTICE. EVERY DAY HERE IN OUR GREAT STATE. CLAIM INTO. THE PRISON SYSTEM TO OUR SCHOOLS WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO WE REALLY. EVERITT OUT BECAUSE IT'S A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE IN SILENT ALL WHAT IS HAPPENING IN AMERICA RIGHT NOW AS IT RELATES TO RACE AS IT RELATES TO GENDER. AS IT RELATES TO RELIGION AND I WOULD NEVER EVER. EVER. SPAULDING THE LEGACY OF DOCTOR KING BY NOT STANDING UP FOR. FIRST RIGHTS AND ENSURE THAT WE STAND FOR OTHER PEOPLE I THINK OF HOW HARD IT WAS THE DOCTOR CAME IN MEMBERS OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. AND SO EVEN THOUGH MY JOURNEY MAYBE HEART THE THINGS I LOOK AT A DIFFICULT. BUT THE REALITY IS IT'S MUCH EASIER THAN DR KING THAT MOTIVATES ME TO REALIZE THAT I'M JUST REALLY DOING SOMETHING SMALL. IN COMPARISON TO WHAT HE DID AND I SHOULD HAVE THE COURAGE TO DO THAT. I AM ALSO CONSTANTLY REMINDED. THAT. THE JUNE. IT WAS NOT JUST FOR ME. IT WAS NOT JUST FOR AYE AFRICAN AMERICAN LITTLE GIRL.
