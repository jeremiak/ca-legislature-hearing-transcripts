ITEM NUMBER FOUR AB TWO ZERO TWO NINE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER BERMAN HAS BEEN PULLED BY THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU MS RUBIO. ON ITEM NUMBER SIX AB. TWO ZERO EIGHT SIX. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS TODAY I AM PRESENTING ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY EIGHTY SIX LEGISLATION SUPPORTING OUR SOCIAL WORKERS IN THE FOSTER FAMILY AGENCY R. F. F. A SYSTEM FOSTER FAMILY AGENCIES OTHERWISE KNOWN AS EVER PHASE OUR PUBLIC OR PRIVATE AGENCIES THAT ARE USED BY COUNTY PLACING DEPARTMENTS FOR CHILDREN WHO REQUIRE MORE INTENSIVE CARE THAN A TYPICAL FAST. OF FOSTER FAMILY HOME. EVER OF AIDS RECRUIT CERTIFY APPROVED TRAINING PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL SUPPORT TO FOSTER PARENTS IN RESOURCE FAMILIES. THERE ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO MAKE AVAILABLE A CORE SET OF SERVICES TO DEPENDENT CHILDREN INCLUDING SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. WORKERS IN THE FFA SYSTEM SERVE ALMOST THIRTEEN THOUSAND FOSTER YOUTH ACCOUNTING FOR ONE THIRD OF ALL FOSTER YOUTH IN HOME BASED CARE IN CALIFORNIA. OTHER THAN COUNTY SOCIAL WORKERS AND PROGRAM FUNDED BY REALIGNMENT THE FFA RATE AND THE INFANT SUPPLEMENTS ARE THE ONLY SECTIONS WITHIN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM THAT DO NOT HAVE AN AUTOMATIC ANNUAL COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS OR COLA. IN ADDITION TO HARMING THE WORK FORCE BY CREATING ECONOMIC CHALLENGES THE LACK OF A COLA HAS A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON CALIFORNIA'S FOSTER YOU THEMSELVES. EIGHT TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN CASEY FAMILY PROGRAMS STUDY REPORTED THAT AN OPTIMAL SOCIAL WORK- TURNOVER RATE IS BELOW TWELVE PERCENT. CHILD WHILE FOR SOCIAL WORKERS EMPLOYED BY NONPROFIT FOSTER FAMILY AGENCIES EXPERIENCE A SHOWS THAT WHEN SOCIAL WORKERS TURN OVER AT A HIGH RATE THE FOSTER YOUTH THEY SERVE HAVE A LOWER CHANCE OF ACHIEVING PERMANENCY AND SPECIFIC SETTINGS. THE PRIMARY FACTOR DRIVING THIS HIGH TURNOVER RATE IS THE FAA'S INABILITY TO PAY COMPETITIVE SALARIES. DUE TO THE STATE SETTING THAT PAY RATE FOR EFFORT FACED SOCIAL WORKERS AT LEVELS FAR BELOW WHAT IS NEEDED TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN THEM. CONSIDERING THAT 80% OF THIS WORKFORCE IDENTIFY AS FEMALE THIS DISCREPANCY CREATES A SERIES GENDER EQUITY ISSUE AS WELL. AB TWENTY EIGHTY SIX WILL ADDRESS THESE ISSUES BY REQUIRING AN ANNUAL STATE APPROVED COLTTE TO REMAIN IN EFFECT IN THE F. OF A RATE. THE COLA WILL STAY IN EFFECT UNTIL THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES PRESENTS RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE ON HOW TO ENSURE THE FFA SOCIAL WORKERS WILL BE ADEQUATELY COMPENSATED IN ORDER TO IMPROVE RETENTION OF CHILD WELL FIRST SOCIAL WORKERS TO IMPROVE PERMAN PERMANENCY OUTCOMES. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY. SHORT TESTIMONY I'M NOT OUT TO TESTIFY I HAVE REBEKAH GONZALEZ WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS. AND LORA HINES WITH STEM FOR YOUTH SOLUTIONS AND SIERRA FOREVER FAMILIES. BEFORE WE TAKE TESTIMONY I'D LIKE TO STEPS QUORUM PLEASE. RAMOS. MATHIS HERE ARAMBULA CHOI FRIEDMAN GIPSON MAIENSCHEIN STONE. THANK YOU THE. I GET YOUR FIRST AND SECOND- FIRST WITNESS PLACE HELLO MY NAME IS REBECCA GONZALEZ AND I'M WITH THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS CALIFORNIA CHAPTER WE REPRESENT TEN THOUSAND SOCIAL WORKERS WITH THEIR DEGREE FROM AN ACCREDITED SCHOOL OF SOCIAL WORK WE WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR SPONSORING THAT SPELL- SOCIAL SOCIAL WORKERS WHO WORK IN THESE AGENCIES ARE HIGHLY EDUCATED THEY ALL HAVE THEIR MASTER'S DEGREE WELL THEY WERE GETTING THEIR DEGREE THEY WERE I AM REQUIRED TO GET BETWEEN NINE HUNDRED AND TWELVE HOUR I TWELVE HUNDRED INTERNSHIP HOURS WHICH IS. TWO TO THREE DAYS A WEEK DURING THEIR MASTER'S PROGRAM WHERE THEY ARE IN AGENCIES LEARNING- HOW TO WORK WITHIN THOSE AGENCIES SO IT'S VERY- IT'S A VERY STRENUOUS IT'S A VERY RIGOROUS PROGRAM- AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER NOTED THE MAJORITY OF THE SOCIAL WORKERS ARE WOMEN AND COME FROM MANY COME FROM COMMUNITIES OF COLOR- STUDENTS WHO ENTER THE SOCIAL WORK FASHION ARE OFTEN FROM COMMUNITIES OF POVERTY THEMSELVES AND MANY FORMER FOSTER YOUTH ARE INSPIRED TO GO INTO THE SOCIAL WORK. PROFESSION ONCE WORKING SOCIAL WORKERS- ARE OFTEN SUPPORTING FAIR THEIR OWN FAMILIES WHILE THEY'RE PAYING BACK THEIR STUDENT LOANS- THIS FORCES THEM TO CHOOSE BETWEEN A JOB THEY MAY LIVE. AND TO SUPPORTING THEIR OWN FAMILIES IN ADDITION THESE CHILDREN OFTEN OFTEN BECOME ATTACHED TO THEIR SOCIAL WORKER AND TURNOVER IS TRAUMATIZING TO THESE YOUTH- AND AS WE KNOW THIS OFTEN RESULTS IN LOWER PERMANENCY OUTCOMES. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU TERRY MEMBERS PLEASE THANK YOU- FIRST I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO FOR ENERGY SAYING THIS BILL. MY NAME IS DOCTOR LAURA HEIGHTS ON THE CEO STANFORD YOU SOLUTIONS NOW KNOWN AS STANFORD SIERRA YOUTH AND FAMILIES. I'M ALSO THE BOARD PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE. US STANFORD TERRACE SERVES OVER FOUR THOUSAND YOUTH AND FAMILIES IN THE SACRAMENTO REGION AND WE PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES SCHOOL SERVICES JUVENILE JUSTICE. ADOPTION AND WE ARE A FOSTER FAMILY AGENCY WE PROVIDE INTENSIVE SERVICES OSTER HOMES AND FOSTER HOMES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN. DISPLACED MULTIPLE TIMES AND ARE DEEMED HARD TO PLACE AND HOMES SOCIAL WORKERS WHO WORK IN AT THE FACE HAVE MASTERS LEVELS THAT EDUCATION AND SOCIAL WORK. OR A RELATED FIELD AND THEY SERVE ON CALL TWENTY FOUR SEVEN. TO PROVIDE INDIVIDUALIZED US THERAPEUTIC SUPPORT SERVICES TO THEIR YOUNG PEOPLE AND FAMILIES. WE ARE UNABLE TO ADEQUATELY PAY OUR SOCIAL WORKERS AND ADJUST THEIR PAY FOR COST OF LIVING INCREASES. AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS OUR SOCIAL WORKERS MUST LEAVE WE FACED A 100% TURNOVER IN OUR TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND HE SAID THOUSAND SIXTEEN YEARS. AND WE CONTINUE TO FACE A HIGH TURNOVER RATE HOWEVER THE COLA OF FOUR POINT 15% IN NINETEEN TWENTY. A HELP TO SLOW THAT TURNOVER SO WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THAT. WE HAVE NO MECHANISM TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL SALARY INCREASES AT THIS POINT THE REASON THAT RETENTION IS SO IMPORTANT IS THAT EVERY TIME OUR SOCIAL WORKERS LEAVE. THE PERMANENCY PROGRESS FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE IS STALLED AND THE STABILITY OF THE PLACEMENT IN THE FOSTER HOME IS ALSO COMPROMISED. YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE STRUGGLE WITH THE LOSS OF THE SOCIAL WORKER AS IT HAS A COMPOUNDING EFFECT ON THEM DUE TO THEIR PAST TRAUMA. FOSTER PARENTS NUMBER ONE COMPLAINT AND- IS TURNOVER OF THEIR FOSTER CARE SOCIAL WORKER WHO IS THEIR PRIMARY SUPPORT. I ASKED THAT THE STATE PRIORITIZE ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR OUR FFA IS. FIRST OF ALL IF IT PAYS ARE CRITICAL IN THE CONTINUE OF CARE REFORM. FOSTER YOUTH NEED STABILITY AND THEIR CARE TO ENSURE THAT THEY CAN ACHIEVE PERMANENCY AND PERMANENCY IS WHERE WE FIND THE TRUE COST SAVINGS FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASKS FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.

JACKIE RESIZER WITH A CALIFORNIA LINES OF JOHN THE FAMILY SERVICES CO SPONSOR THE BILL IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. DILLON WE SANTI WITH LILY PUT FAMILIES FOSTER CARE AGENCY AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. VERY GOOD LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ON MISTER MATHIS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR. ARE YOU ACCEPT DEAN- CO AUTHORS ARE JOINT AUTHORS ON THIS ABSOLUTELY WOULD LOVE TO JOINT AUTHORED THIS WITH YOUR SHOW BIPARTISAN SUPPORT ABSOLUTELY WE NEED ALL THE HELP THAT WE CAN GET THIS IS A CRITICAL ISSUE FOR FOSTER YOUTH AND SO ANY HELP. WILL BE WELCOME ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU. MR GIPSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR- I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR I THINK IT'S A GREAT BILL. I THINK THAT AGAIN- SOCIAL WORKERS ARE OUR FIRST RESPONDERS IN A LOT OF SENSE- CERTAINLY TO BE COMPENSATED WE CANNOT AFFORD TO ALLOW- THIS- CAREER CHOICE- TO DWINDLE- WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PROMOTE THIS AND ALSO TRY TO GET PEOPLE INTO THIS PROFESSION. BECAUSE THESE ARE THE FRONTLINE INDIVIDUALS GOING TO CARE FOR OUR CHILDREN- MOVING FORWARD AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THIS PROFESSION. IS TAKEN WAS TAKEN CARE OF AND ALSO- CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR. THEM TO CREATE A LIFESTYLE- BY PROVIDING THE KIND OF SERVICE THEY PROVIDE BUT ALSO MAKE SURE TO GO HUNGRY AT THE SAME TIME WITH THE CONSULATE IN CALIFORNIA THINGS OF THAT NATURE SO. I'VE ONE SUPPORTED AND WILL GLADLY LOVE TO BE A CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL THANK YOU. CHOI THANKS CHAIR THIS MUST BE VERY POPULAR OF BILL IF YOU HAVE A ROOM- ADD ME ALSO IT'S- THIS IS THE FIRST. I WONDER IF- SORCERER- WORK REQUIRES A MASTERS TO VIA IN COMPARISON TO OTHER- OCCUPATION- OF COMPARABLE ORDER IN EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS SO. IT IT IS IT- EACH QUARTER TO OR THE OCCUPATION PAY THIS A C. P. R. INCREASES A BASIC ANY OTHER IN OCCUPATION OR HALF OF SALARY INCREASE AT ON A WIDE THIS HAS NOT BEEN TAKING PLACE. IF YOU WANT I MEAN AT THE END GENERAL SOCIAL WORKERS WITH THE AND A MASTER'S DEGREE MAKE MUCH LESS THAN OTHER PROFESSIONS WHERE YOU HAVE THAT LEVEL OF EDUCATION THEY GOING TO SOCIAL WORK BECAUSE THEY WANT TO HELP PEOPLE- THEY HAVE A DEEP DESIRE TO HELP THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THEY KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE SOME SACRIFICES BY CHOOSING THIS CAREER. BUT THIS PARTICULAR AREA OF SOCIAL WORK WORKING IN FF PHASE IS LOWER COMPARED TO EIGHTY EVEN THE OTHER PLACES YOU COULD GO TO IN SOCIAL WORK SO FFA IS LOSE THEIR WORKERS TO OTHER AREAS OF SOCIAL WORK. YEAH BECAUSE WHAT I'M WORRIED THESE THAT THAT THIS IS A BASIC OF COLA INCREASE IS NOT GONNA CATCH UP WITH THE IF THIS OF ADMITTED DISCREPANCY HOW WE CAN RAISE IN THE EQUAL LEVEL. I THINK THAT SAYS SOMETHING FOR ME AS AN ART SOMEWHERE AND I THINK THIS IS WHAT THE BEGINNING IS AND JUST- AS A FORMER TEACHER R. I'M SO CURRENT A TEACHER- JUST IN COMPARISON AS A TEACHER YOU CAN START TEACHING WITH A BACHELOR'S DEGREE. AND YOU GET PAID MORE IF YOU GET A MASTER'S DEGREE AS OPPOSED TO STARTING AS A MASTER'S DEGREE AND NOT MAKING YOU KNOW ADEQUATE COMPENSATION FOR IT AND YOU KNOW YES STOP THROUGH TEACHING THEY'LL- THE B. CTA. THE ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS IS A AND HAS BUILT IN- YOU KNOW A REGULAR COLA OR AT LEAST THE QUOTATIONS AND THAT'S NOT TRUE IN THIS CASE. ESPECIALLY THIS OF SOCIAL WORKERS TEND TO WORK ON A VERY EMOTIONALLY I HAD TO THE TRAINING KIND OF WORK I SAW A THING OF THE A COMPENSATION APARTMENT SHOULD BE BROUGHT UP. FOR SOME. THANK YOU YOU AGREE. VERY GOOD ALL WE HAVE A AND I WANT TO THANK IS GOING TO FROM HERE ALSO. FROM THE CULT AN AREA THANK YOU YES MAYES RUBIO FROM BRING MINE YEAH SHE LOOKED FAMILIAR.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE BERRY JUTTING WITH THE CALIFORNIA DISABILITY SERVICES ASSOCIATION HERE- TO PRESENT AND PRODUCT A SPONSOR AB TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN. THIS BILL WOULD SIMPLY CHANGE THE MECHANISM WE USE FOR MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES WHEN THIS WHEN THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE GOES UP FOR PROVIDERS OF SERVICES TO INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. THE CURRENT MECHANISM IS BACKWARD LOOKING HISTORICAL IT ONLY PROVIDES- INCREASES FOR. WRITERS WHO HAVE OF FOLKS UNDERNEATH THE NEW MINIMUM WAGE THRESHOLD. UNFORTUNATE THIS LEAVE THAT A LOT OF THE HIGH COST AREAS OF THE STATE AND EVEN IN OTHER AREAS OF THE STATE WE ARE STRUGGLING TO KEEP UP WITH WAGE GROWTH AND COMPETITIVE MARKET PLACES. AND WE CAN'T EVEN PAY OUR STAFF EVEN IN LOWER COST AREAS MINIMUM WAGE FOR GOING TO BE COMPETITIVE THESE ARE PEOPLE PROVIDE SERVICES TO INDIVIDUALS. WITH DISABILITIES THEY DON'T DESERVE TO BE MINIMUM WAGE EMPLOYEES IN THE FIRST PLACE- BUT THIS NEW PUT THIS PROPOSAL WOULD AT LEAST ADDRESS SOME RATE RELIEF WITH A THREE POINT 33% AUTOMATIC PASSED THROUGH. THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO PAY OUR STAFF MORE AS THE MINIMUM WAGE GOES UP. THANK YOU THANK YOU AND I DO WANT TO REMIND YOU THAT WE HAD ABOUT THREE MOTIONS. AND SIX SECONDS BUT- OUR NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY MY NAME IS EDWARD HERSHEY ON THE VICE PRESIDENT OF OPERATIONS FOR HOME OF GUIDING HANDS. A SERVICE PROVIDER IN SAN DIEGO THAT PROVIDE SERVICES TO OVER THIRTY NINE HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. I'M ALSO A PARENT OF A YOUNG WOMAN THAT RECEIVE SERVICES FROM THE SAN DIEGO REGIONAL CENTER. AS A PROVIDER THE MINIMUM WAGE CORK AS DESCRIBED BY THE LA- HAS HAD A DEVASTATING IMPACT ON MY ORGANIZATION. CURRENTLY WE HAVE THIRTY NINE OPEN DIRECT SERVICE PROVIDER POSITIONS THAT TRANSLATES TO THIRTEEN HUNDRED HOURS A WEEK. THAT WE STRUGGLE TO PROVIDE FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS THAT NEED SERVICES. AS WITH MANY OF THE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS IN OUR INDUSTRY WE HAVE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT TO TURN OVER. THAT IMPACTS OUR ABILITY TO OFFER CONSISTENT SERVICES FOR THE INDIVIDUALS WE SERVE. TO HIGHLIGHT THIS IMPACT I WANT TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY. OPPORTUNITY TO TELL YOU A STORY ABOUT MY DAUGHTER JULIA. JULIE IS TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD LIKE MANY TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLD SHE LOVES TO DANCE SHE LOVES TO SING. SHE LOVES TO HANG OUT WITH HER FRIENDS AND SHE HAS UNCONDITIONAL LOVE FOR EVERYONE SHE MEETS. THAT LAST PART MIGHT NOT BE EVERYBODY BUT IT DOES DESCRIBE MY DAUGHTER JULIA. IN ADDITION SHE ALSO HAS WILLIAM CENTRO. HER GOAL IN LIFE IS TO MOVE OUT ON HER OWN AND WITH THE SUPPORT OF HER DIRECT SERVICE PROVIDER SHE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL ONE DAY AND THAT. UNFORTUNATELY OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS SHE HAS HAD TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TURN OVER IN HER SUPPORT. SHE'S HAD THREE CASE WORKERS IN TWO YEARS SHE'S HAD FOR DIRECT SERVICE PROVIDERS IN TWO YEARS. NOW YOU CAN IMAGINE SHE HASN'T BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN REACHING HER GOAL TO MOVE OUT. IN FACT AT THIS POINT SHE TAKES IT PERSONALLY SHE BELIEVES THAT THEY'RE LEAVING HER. BECAUSE SHE'S DONE SOMETHING WRONG. SO AND NOW INSTEAD OF REACHING HER GOAL OF MOVING OUT SHE'S WORKING ON COUNSELING TO HELP SUPPORT HER WITH THAT LOSS. RECENTLY THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT OUTCOMES AND PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AS A PARENT AND A PROVIDER I AM IN FULL SUPPORT OF PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES HEARING JULIA STORY HOW WOULD YOU MEASURE SUCCESS. IN RELATIONSHIP TO HER OUTCOMES IS IT THE FAULT OF THE PROVIDERS THAT SHE'S NOT SUCCESSFUL IS IT THE FAULT OF THE REGIONAL CENTER THAT SHE'S NOT SUCCESSFUL. TO THE FAILURE TO MEET JULIUS OUT COME FALL. TO THE REGIONAL CENTER OR THE PROVIDERS HOW CAN WE EXPECT TO REACH. PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES AND TELL THE SYSTEM IS STABLE ASSEMBLYMEMBER HOLDEN'S BILL AB TWENTY TWENTY FOUR HELPS TO PROVIDE THE STABILITY IT ESTABLISHES IN LAW. A WELL REASONED CONNECTION BETWEEN INCREASES IN STATE MINIMUM WAGE AND THE COST INCREASES THEY CREATE IN PROVIDING SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. IT THEN MAKES THE APPROPRIATE RATE ADJUSTMENTS UNIFORMLY AND STATEWIDE IN CLOSING I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. A DOCTOR MOTION BY DOCTOR CHOI. THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR STORY FOUNDER FOR BEING THERE EVEN THOUGH SHE'S HAD THE TURN OVER SHE'S GOT YOU THE STABILITY.
