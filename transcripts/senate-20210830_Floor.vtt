00:48:19.096 --> 00:48:20.731
FIRE HAZARD ZONE HOWEVER OUR

00:48:20.797 --> 00:48:23.400

THAT THIS BILL. HAS BEEN ONE OF

00:48:54.965 --> 00:48:56.867
THE MOST AWFUL CONSENSUS

CONSIDERATION. EVERYTHING THAT

00:49:21.091 --> 00:49:23.060
WAS BROUGHT UP. AND I THINK

00:49:23.126 --> 00:49:25.329
THAT THIS WAS A GOOD BALANCE OF

00:49:25.395 --> 00:49:28.098
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AND TAKE

00:49:28.165 --> 00:49:28.632

01:05:28.591 --> 01:05:30.826
DEFINITION OF COUNTY OFFICERS

01:05:42.371 --> 01:05:44.040
LIMITS THAT WERE LEGALLY IN

01:05:44.106 --> 01:05:48.811
EFFECT PRIOR TO JANUARY. ONE

01:05:48.878 --> 01:05:49.445
TWENTY TWENTY TWO IN ANY COUNTY

01:05:49.512 --> 01:05:51.414
S. RIVAL. THANK YOU SENATOR

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:52.982
HERTZBERG IS THERE ANY

01:05:53.049 --> 01:05:53.549
DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS

01:05:53.616 --> 01:05:58.120
ITEM. SENATOR GORGEOUS.

01:05:58.187 --> 01:06:02.291
PRESIDENT. WHEN I WAS A MEMBER

01:06:02.358 --> 01:06:03.959
OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS I

01:06:04.026 --> 01:06:06.595
TRY TO PUT FORWARD. TERM

01:06:06.662 --> 01:06:08.531
LIMITS. AT THE TIME I THOUGHT

01:06:08.597 --> 01:06:11.534
THAT. THREE TERMS WHICH WOULD

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:15.071
BE A TOTAL OF FOUR YEARS- FOR-

01:06:15.137 --> 01:06:17.039
YOUR TERM SENSE THREE B. TOTAL

01:06:17.106 --> 01:06:18.808
TWELVE YEARS WOULD BE A

01:06:18.874 --> 01:06:22.211
SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF TIMETO DO

01:06:22.278 --> 01:06:24.947
THE PEOPLE'S WORK AND SO I

01:06:25.014 --> 01:06:25.548
THINK THERE IS A BALANCE

01:06:25.614 --> 01:06:27.583
BETWEEN TERM LIMITS THAT ARE

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:30.019
PUNITIVE. AND TERM LIMITS THAT

01:06:30.086 --> 01:06:31.387
I THINK ARE EFFECTIVE WHILE

01:06:31.454 --> 01:06:33.155
STILL ENCOURAGING GOOD PEOPLE

01:06:33.222 --> 01:06:35.458
TO LEARN AND BECOME MORE

01:06:35.524 --> 01:06:36.992
EFFECTIVE AS TIME GOES ON. THE

01:06:37.059 --> 01:06:38.828
IDEA OF HAVING ONE TERM. THIS

01:06:38.894 --> 01:06:40.796
IS A TOUGH ISSUE FOR ME MORE

01:06:40.863 --> 01:06:42.565
FROM A PHILOSOPHICAL STANDPOINT

01:06:42.631 --> 01:06:44.266
WHERE YOU WANT TO RESPECT. THE

01:06:44.333 --> 01:06:47.336
WILL OF THE LOCAL CONSTITUENCY

01:06:47.403 --> 01:06:47.970
THE LOCAL ELECTORATE THAT VOTED

01:06:48.037 --> 01:06:50.005
IN THIS WAY. BUT IT'S HARD TO

01:06:50.072 --> 01:06:51.574
IMAGINE THE EFFICACY OF AN

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:52.074
ORGANIZATION THAT WOULD

01:06:52.141 --> 01:06:55.578
FUNCTION. EFFECTIVELY BY

01:06:55.644 --> 01:06:58.080
LIMITING IT TO A SINGLE TERM. I

01:06:58.147 --> 01:06:59.382
THINK WE HAVE SEEN IT

01:06:59.448 --> 01:07:01.450
EXPERIMENTATION IS ACROSS THE

01:07:01.517 --> 01:07:03.552
STATE AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

01:07:03.619 --> 01:07:05.354
AND I THINK ONE TERM IS JUST

01:07:05.421 --> 01:07:07.723
SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH TO DO THE

01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:10.159
PEOPLE'S BUSINESS AND EXPECT

01:07:10.226 --> 01:07:12.027
INDIVIDUALS- TO BE ABLE TO

01:07:12.094 --> 01:07:14.430
LEARN THE INSTRUMENTALITY IN

01:07:14.497 --> 01:07:15.264
THE FUNCTIONALITY OF

01:07:15.331 --> 01:07:17.867
GOVERNMENT. AND IT'S HARD WHEN

01:07:17.933 --> 01:07:20.336
THE LOCAL ELECTORATE ONE CITY

01:07:20.403 --> 01:07:22.071
IN ONE SPECIFIC WAY BY VIRTUE

01:07:22.138 --> 01:07:24.240
OF A BALLOT INITIATIVE. BUT IT

01:07:24.306 --> 01:07:26.075
ALL ENDS THE OVERALL

01:07:26.142 --> 01:07:27.743
EFFECTIVENESS OF LOCAL

01:07:27.810 --> 01:07:28.778
GOVERNMENTS I RESPECT BOTH

01:07:28.844 --> 01:07:30.946
SIDES OF THIS ISSUE. I WOULD

01:07:31.013 --> 01:07:34.116
HAVE TO- CONFIRM MY SUPPORT FOR

01:07:34.183 --> 01:07:35.918
THIS BILL BECAUSE YOU JUST

01:07:35.985 --> 01:07:37.853
SIMPLY CANNOT ALLOW GOVERNMENT

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:41.323
TO FUNCTION. WITH THAT LIMITED

01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:42.491
AMOUNT OF TIME IN SERVICE.

01:07:42.558 --> 01:07:43.058
THANK YOU SIR BARGES CENTER

01:07:43.125 --> 01:07:45.494

01:07:49.231 --> 01:07:51.167
BROUGHT IT UP AND THE BOTTOM

01:07:51.233 --> 01:07:53.169
LINE IS THAT MEASURE K. PASSED

01:07:53.235 --> 01:07:55.004
BY DECEMBER TO DINO CITIZENS

01:07:55.070 --> 01:07:59.008
THAT VOTED. TO DO SUPERVISOR-

01:07:59.074 --> 01:08:00.876
LIMITS TERM LIMITS AND ALSO

AND THEY FILED A LAWSUIT BUT

01:08:06.348 --> 01:08:09.752
THEY LOST AND- SO NOW THIS

01:08:09.819 --> 01:08:10.953
BILL'S GOING TO THE BUILDING TO

01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:12.421
CIRCUMVENT AGAIN THE WILL OF

01:08:12.488 --> 01:08:15.191
THE PEOPLE. THE PEOPLE OF SAN

01:08:15.257 --> 01:08:16.525
BERNARDINO COUNTY HAVE MADE

01:08:16.592 --> 01:08:17.626
THEIR VOICE CLEAR THAT THEY

01:08:17.693 --> 01:08:19.328
WANT TO LIMIT TERM LIMITS FOR

01:08:19.395 --> 01:08:22.531
SUPERVISORS AND- THE SALARIES

01:08:22.598 --> 01:08:25.201

I SUPPORTED AND WORKED FOR BUT

01:08:46.956 --> 01:08:49.525
MAJOR K. PAST I THINK THAT IT

02:48:48.918 --> 02:48:52.188
MANY HOOPS THAT MAKE IT REALLY-

02:48:52.255 --> 02:48:54.924
HARD FOR THEM TO GET CARE- THIS

02:48:54.991 --> 02:48:56.292
MEETS THEM WHERE THEY ARE IN

02:48:56.359 --> 02:48:58.027
THE STREETS IN THE ENCAMPMENTS.

02:48:58.094 --> 02:48:59.696

THEY DO THEY ARE TURNED AWAY

02:49:10.807 --> 02:49:11.875
BECAUSE OF BUREAUCRATIC

02:49:11.941 --> 02:49:13.676

MAINSTREAM HEALTH CARE DELIVERY

02:49:42.505 --> 02:49:44.874
MODELS DO NOT FIT THE REALITY

02:49:44.941 --> 02:49:46.476
OF THE STREETS AND SO IF WE ARE

02:49:46.543 --> 02:49:48.344
GOING TO REALLY HELP. THEN IT'S

02:49:48.411 --> 02:49:49.746
