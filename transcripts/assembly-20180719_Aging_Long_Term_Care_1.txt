I'M ASH KALRA COLORISM A MEMBER FROM SAN JOSE A DISTRICT TWENTY SEVEN I'M VERY HONORED TO BE THE CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY AGING AND LONG TERM CARE COMMITTEE. AND ALSO HONORED TO HAVE WITH ME ABOUT MY COLLEAGUES WERE KAMLAGER-DOVE [INAUDIBLE] I'M AND I JUST WANTED. EVERYONE THAT'S HERE -- MANY OF YOU. I HAVE GOTTEN TO KNOW PRETTY WELL. OVER THE LAST SAID YEAR AND A HALF OR SO SINCE THE OF MINE ROLE. WAS ESTABLISHED WITH THE COMMUNITY. I AND I LOOK FORWARD TO MEETING MORE OF YEAH I BECAUSE AND PART OF THE REASON WHY I LIKE DOING THESE. INFORMATION HEARINGS AROUND THE STATE IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO REALLY CREATE NETWORK. OF ACTIVISTS AND ADVOCATES AROUND THE STATE AND I THINK THAT BASED UPON WHAT WE'VE SEEN HAPPEN OVER THE PAST YEAR LEGISLATIVELY THROUGH THE BUDGET. I THINK OUR COLLECTIVE WORK TOGETHER IS WORKING OF WE'RE SEEING THINGS GETTING DONE WE'RE SEEING. ARMED WHO UP BUDGET REFLECTING SOME OF THE NEEDS SHOW AND ALL THE NEEDS OF SOME OF THE NEEDS. THAT TERM THAT WE HAVE IN TERMS OF CARING FOR AGING THE LONG TERM CARE. COMMUNITIES. ARE AND WE'RE ALSO SEEING. SOME MOMENTUM BEING BUILT I IN TERMS OF OUR ABILITY. TO I AND I THINK THAT -- AS MANY OF YOU OF OUR PART OF OUR WERE ACT THE INFORMATION HEARINGS WE HAD LAST YEAR. OF THROUGHOUT THE STATE A IN SALAS A IN LOS ANGELES AND SAN DIEGO. OF SAW DURING THE COURSE OF THIS YEAR MUCH OF WHAT WE LEARNED OR DISCUSSED DURING THOSE HEARINGS WERE ACTUALLY IMPROVED OVER ACTUALLY PUSH FORWARD AS LEGISLATION. AND HAVE EITHER BEEN IMPLEMENTED GRANTED IN THE BUDGET OR ARE. STILL GOING TO LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WE HOPE WILL HAVE A POSITIVE OUTCOME AYE AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER THINGS -- THERE'S PLENTY MORE TO DO ON THE CHECKLIST TO WORK THAT WE NEED TO GET DONE BUT I FOUND THE HEARINGS BE VERY PRODUCTIVE AND THAT'S WHY I'M VERY EXCITED. TO BE HERE TODAY ARM OF THE TO DISCUSS A FURTHER BUT WE NEED TO DEAL. OF AND I THINK THAT THE THE CALIFORNIA TASK FORCE ON FAMILY CARE GIVING. A REPORT HUB CERTAINLY BRINGS UP A LOT OF ISSUES THAT CONTINUE TO COME UP WE TALK ABOUT. ISSUES OF CARING FOR OUR ELDERLY CARING FOR PEOPLE DISABILITIES AND IN PARTICULAR THE STRESS OF PUTS ON CAREGIVERS AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO. ADMITTED TO ADDRESS THAT IN AN APPROPRIATE WAY. I WANNA THANK YOU S. USC LEONARD DAVIS SCHOOL GERONTOLOGY UP FOR HOSTING THE COMMITTEE HEARING AND FOR THEIR WORK. ON THIS REPORT US OR THE ONE THING A EUROPEAN ARE STONE FOUNDATION FOR FUNDING. THIS WHERE THE PROJECT AND I'M VERY EXCITED TO HEAR. AND MORE SIGNIFICANTLY WHAT COMES AFTER THIS BECAUSE I DO THINK THERE'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO LEARN. I'M FROM THIS REPORT FROM THE THOUGHTS OF OUR EXPERTS I'M AND TO MOVE FORWARD ON WITH. TOPPLED LEGISLATION OF PAPA A COUPLE BUDGET WITH THE NEW GOVERNOR COMING AND THAT WILL HELP US. CONTINUE TO GIVE IT TO CARE FOR OUR CARE GIVERS ALBERT SHOULD WE KNOW RIGHT NOW IS NOT HAPPENING QUITE ENOUGH WE KNOW OUR CAREGIVERS ARE STRUGGLING. AND SO WITH THAT BEFORE I WE MOVE FORWARD I CERTAINLY WANT TO GIVE A MY COLLEAGUE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO SAY A FEW WORDS LIKE TO HAVE A VERY BRIEF INTRODUCTION AND SO BUT I'M VERY EXCITED THAT AND EARLIER THIS YEAR. AS AMERICANS TO REMEMBER SYDNEY A KAMLAGER-DOVE OF A WAS. ELECTED AND AND SOON AFTER SWORN AND A BECAUSE OF THE NEWEST MEMBER OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE. I HAVE BOUGHT THAT TIME AT LEAST AND ABOUT A COUPLE OF YOU KNOW THOSE TRANSITION THIS YEAR BUT IT'S BEEN GOOD BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT FOLKS LIKE SYDNEY. AYE INTO POSITIVE DISSIDENT AGAIN THE SECOND HALF WHERE AMERICAN WOMAN ELECTED TO THE LOS ANGELES BEAUTY COLLEGE DISTRICT. AND MOST RECENTLY SHE WAS OF THE DISTRICT DIRECTORS WHO ARE WONDERFUL SENATOR HOLLY MITCHELL AND AND A VERY BRIEF TIME THAT -- SYDNEY IS BEEN WITH US LEGISLATORS ALREADY MAKING HER IMPACT FELT AND ACTUALLY. ALMOST RIGHT AWAY A UPON JOINING US INDICATOR INTERESTS IN TERMS OF ISSUES REGARDING AGING LONG TERM CARE SENIORS. AND SO I WAS VERY EXCITED TO HAVE REJOINED THE AND VERY EXCITED TO HOLD THIS HEARING HERE LOS ANGELES CLOSER DISTRICT BUDS OF THE CERTAINLY -- DATA OF FELLOW COMMITTEE MEMBER THAT IS SO COMMITTED I THINK IT'S GONNA BE A BENEFIT ALL OF US OF A CITY. WELL THANK YOU CHAIR -- I WANNA. OFFICIALLY THANK MY COLLEAGUE AND THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE ARCH KALRA FOR YOUR COMMITMENT -- TO FURTHERING THIS KIND OF DOLLARS DIALOGUE ON BEHALF OF THE STATE WHILE I CAN'T OUT WELCOME YOU TO THE FIFTY FOURTH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT I CAN WELCOME YOU TO MY ALMA MATER I ACTUALLY TOOK CLASSES IN THIS VERY AUDITORIUM. AND SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT GERONTOLOGY I'M HAVE A LITTLE FLASHBACKS OF MY OWN -- WE SPEND SO MUCH TIME TALKING ABOUT. HOW WE'RE GOING TO RELATE TO MILLENNIALS? BUT I THINK IT'S EQUALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE TO ADDRESS A NOT FORGET. HOW WE INTERACT WITH OUR ELDER COMMUNITIES? AND REALLY HOW WE WORK TO FORAGE THE BRIDGES ON THE GAPS BETWEEN THE GENERATIONS BECAUSE ULTIMATELY IT'S ALWAYS ONE GENERATION TAKING CARE OF ANOTHER AS IT PREPARES TO STEP INTO. THOSE SPACES IN THOSE SHOES AND SO RATHER THAN CREATING GENERATIONAL SILOS YOU KNOW HOW DO WE CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT CHALLENGE. ARM ALL OF OUR GENERATIONS BUT SPECIFICALLY OUR ELDER COMMUNITIES I'M AND THE CAREGIVERS WHO ARE GENERALLY. YOU KNOW THEIR CHILDREN AND BABY BOOMERS -- YOU KNOW AS WE CONTINUE TO EVOLVE AS A SOCIETY AND A COMMUNITIES SO THAT'S WHY THESE KINDS OF DIALOGUES ARE REALLY IMPORTANT. YOU KNOW MY GRANDMOTHER PASSED AWAY IN APRIL ACTUALLY THE NIGHT BEFORE -- I WAS ELECTED AND MY MOTHER. SPENT HER. FINAL YEARS AS A PRIMARY CAREGIVER FROM MY GRANDMOTHER. IN TALKING ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT CARE GIVERS SPACE STRESSES THE FINANCES THIS NOTION THAT YOU HAVE TO DEPLETE EVERYTHING IN ORDER TO GET THE KIND OF SUB FUNDING AND SUPPORT THAT YOU KNOW YOUR PARENT OR HONOR SISTER WHO EVER. DESERVES. AND WHAT HOW THAT IMPACTS A FAMILY HOW THAT IMPACTS THE COMMUNITY AND ULTIMATELY. HOW WE CAN DO BETTER? AND SO WOULD CERTAINLY NOT ABOUT STRESSING OUT ONE PERSON. OR SACRIFICING ONE PERSON. FOR THE BENEFIT OF ANOTHER IS FIGURING OUT HOW TO RAISE THE TIED FOR ALL OF THE BOAT SO THAT CARE GIVERS AND THOSE THAT THEY ARE CARING FOR FEEL SAFE. AND FEEL LIKE THEY'RE BEING THOUGHT OF IN THE POLICIES IN IN THE FUNDING DECISIONS THAT COUNTIES THAT STATES IN THAT LOCAL COMMUNITIES MAKE ARM AND I THINK THAT'S WHY THIS COMMITTEE IN THIS CONVERSATION IS SO IMPORTANT AND I THINK THE PANEL. FOR THE EXPERTISE AND FOR THE INFORMATION THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SHARE. AND LASTLY I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WHEN WE HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS WERE REALLY TALKING ABOUT THE CULTURAL SENSITIVITIES THAT COME WITH THE AGING PROCESS IF IT'S REYES IF IT'S GENDER IF IT'S ETHNICITY IF IT'S RELIGION. IF IT SEXUAL ORIENTATION WE HAVE FOLKS THAT ARE AGING WHO ARE AS DIVERSE AS WE ARE AS OUR COMMUNITIES ARE IN SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW WE'RE FUNDING IN CARRYING IN KEEPING THIS COMMUNITY SAFE. AS IT IS THAT WE'RE RECOGNIZING THE DIVERSE CITY ARM AND THE CULTURAL SENSITIVITY THAT WE SHOULD BE USING AS A LANDS WHEN WE ARE DEALING WITH OUR CARE GIVER AND OUR ELDER COMMUNITIES SO I'M EXCITED ABOUT THE INFORMATION THAT WE'RE GOING TO HEAR AND THANK YOU AGAIN MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU SAME MEMBER I THINK A BECAUSE YOU I'M SO EXCITED TO HAVE -- OR MY MY COLLEAGUES ON BOARD OF THESE REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUES NOT JUST BECAUSE OF A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE PREVENT BUT ALSO HER ELOQUENCE AND DETERMINATION. AND MAKING SURE WE DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN -- CONTINUE. TO INCREASE RESOURCES OF MOBERG CAREGIVERS BUT ALSO TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE AUDIO OF A QUALITY OF LIFE THAT. ARE ELDERLY AND AND PEOPLE DISABILITIES CERTAINLY DESERVE. AND SO OFTEN WITH THAT THAT'S A GOOD MOVE ON AND WHAT I'M GONNA DO RIGHT NOW IS GIVE A QUICK A COUPLE MINUTES A ONE MINUTE OR SO. ADDED DISCUSS WHY WE'RE HERE WHICH IS ACR THIRTY EIGHT BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER BROWN OUT HE'S GONNA HAVE FROM IN A MOMENT. OF WHICH ESTABLISHED THE CALIFORNIA TASK FORCE ON FAMILY CAREGIVING TO EXAMINE ISSUES RELATIVE TO THE CHALLENGES FACED BY FAMILY CAREGIVERS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE. CAREGIVER SUPPORT. OTHERS TASK FORCE WAS REQUIRED TO SUBMIT AN INTERIM REPORT LEGISLATURE NO LATER THAN JANUARY. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND A FINAL REPORT NO LATER THAN JULY. TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE PURPOSE OF THIS HEARING AS WITH THE TASK FORCE PRESENT REPORT AND THEIR FINDINGS LAWS OUR POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS. AND ALL STAKEHOLDERS RESPOND AND THEN SUBSEQUENT TO THAT OF THE WILL HAVE CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT IN THE MONTHS AHEAD ANZIO CERTAIN THE MEMBERS THE LEGISLATURE TO SEE. OF AS IT APPLIES TO SOME OF THE REALLY IMPORTANT RECOMMENDATIONS WHAT WE CAN DO TO TRY TO MOVE SOME OF THEM FORWARD. A AND SO WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE A MY PREDECESSOR AS CHAIR OF THE AGING A LONG TERM CARE COMMITTEE AND I FEEL VERY FORTUNATE BECAUSE IT'S NOT A MATTER OF HER HANGING THE BATON TO ME. REALLY WERE BOTH RUNNING WITH THE BATON AND I THINK THAT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU'RE BUILDING A TEAM. OF FOLKS I REALLY CARE ABOUT THESE ISSUES [INAUDIBLE] AND I'M SUBSEQUENT TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER BROWN'S I'M PUTTING FORWARD ACR THIRTY EIGHT SO NOW WE CAN ALL BENEFIT FROM THE INFORMATION FROM THE REPORT AND THAT WE CAN ALL MOVE THE BALL FLOORS WITH THAT AS A MEMBER ASH A BROWN SHOW BROWN. THANK YOU SO MUCH CHAIRMAN KALRA. I'M SORRY THAT I THEN GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE WITH YOU. AND A ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF THE PEOPLE THINK [INAUDIBLE] OUR BUT I THANK YOU THANK YOU BOTH FOR RUNNING WITH THE THOUGHT THAT WAS A PART OF MY PREPARED NOTES HOW ABOUT THAT. HE OUR THIRTY EIGHT THE CALIFORNIA TASK FORCE ON FAMILY CARE GIVING. BEGAN OF THE BILL. IT WAS AB. SEVENTEEN FORTY FOUR THAT BILL WAS PASSED BY BOTH HOUSES WITH NO NO VOTES. BUT IT WAS VETO. AND THE MESSAGE WAS THAT IT WASN'T NECESSARY. HOWEVER PRESIDENT HAD ALREADY BEEN SET BY MR MURPHY I'M ONLY. IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHEN HE AUTHORED THE ARM RESOLUTION ON FIBROMYALGIA. BOTH RESOLUTIONS WERE OF STATEWIDE IMPORTANCE. AS THE FORMER CHAIR OF AGING AND LONG TERM CARE. IT WAS MY HONOR THE FIGHT FOR SENIORS. AND OUR ISSUES. AS THE CARE GIVER MYSELF FOR MOST OF MY LIFE I UNDERSTAND FIRST HAND. ISSUES CONFRONTING FAMILY CAREGIVERS. AND I MADE IT A TOP PRIORITY. I KNEW MUCH OF THE WORK. AND MUCH MORE WORK HAD TO BE DONE IN THIS AREA. UNPAID CAREGIVERS ARE THE FOR GOTTEN OFF WORK FORCE OF THE LONG TERM CARE SYSTEM. WE PROVIDE SOME FORTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. IN FLAVOR [INAUDIBLE] FREE LABOR. SO WHEN A A RP PROPOSED THE IDEA. I KNEW THE TIME WAS RIGHT. WITH PARTNERS LIKE ART STONE THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON AGING. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. THE ALZHEIMER'S THAT THE ASSOCIATION. THE PROPOSAL WAS ON TARGET FEED. THE FUNDING WAS SECURED AND IT DIDN'T COST THE STATE BUDGET UNDYING. THIS WILL THE PUBLIC PRIVATELY FUNDED OPERATION. THE TASK FORCE WAS TO EXAMINE ISSUES FACED BY CAREGIVERS THEY WERE TO REVIEW EXISTING THE EXISTING NETWORKS OF SERVICES. AND SUPPORTS AVAILABLE TO CAREGIVERS. BEFORE THEY BEGAN THEIR WORK. THERE WAS NO. THERE WAS NO COMPLETE INVENTORY OF CARE GIVING PROGRAMS AVAILABLE. TO US SUCCESSFULLY ADDRESS THE SURGING POPULATION. OF OLDER ADULTS WHO HAVE SIGNIFICANT NEEDS FOR LONG TERM CARE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. THIS TASK FORCE WILL NOW MAKE POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE. I'M SO HAPPY TO BE WITH THIS GROUP OF WOMEN AND MEN. WHO WERE GOING TO HELP TAKE THIS TO ANOTHER LEVEL? TO HELP SO MANY FAMILIES. THANK YOU EACH MEMBER OF THE TASK FORCE. UFC LEONARD DAVID SCHOOL OF GERONTOLOGY. THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE. DR DONNA BITTEN. STAFF INCLUDING BARRY BREWER. AND A SPECIAL THANK YOU. TO YOUR CHAMPION. RETIRING SANDY FITZPATRICK. AND TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER ASH KALRA. AND NOW TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER DELVE. I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR YOUR WORKERS TO CONTINUE SOMETHING THAT I HOLD SO DEAR. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH I'M AGAIN OF THANK YOU FOR REALLY. BEING OF THE LEADER AND CHAMPION ON THIS WE WOULDN'T BE HERE IF WAS NOT FOR USE WITH THANK YOU A AND WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE SOME EXTRAORDINARY PANELISTS ON THE EXPERTISE. OF MANY OF THE UPPER TASK FORCE MEMBERS AND AND SPEAKING OF WHICH THE CHAIR. OF OUR A CALIFORNIA TASK WASN'T FAMILY CAREGIVING DR DONNA BENTON -- AND I'M GONNA. MISS OUT WHAT IS THE NAME OF FOUR OF YOU THAN YOU GUYS GO DOWN THE LINE AND AND AND MAKE YOUR COMMENTS. OF ON THE ON THE REPORT I'M DONNA BENTON WAS A RESEARCH ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF GERONTOLOGY. AND AS I MENTIONED CHAIR OF THE TASK FORCE OF THE NEXT TO HER IS A SANDY FITZPATRICK SECTOR DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA COMMISSION. ON AGING AND CULTURE OF THE TASK FORCE. A BUT AND THEN E. L. A DIRECTOR DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION AND MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA TASK FORCE ON FAMILY CAREGIVING AND THEN FINDING A DOCTOR. KATHLEEN WILBUR A MERRY. FOR OF PROFESSOR OF GERONTOLOGY HERE AT USC SO YOU CAN WE HAVE SOME EXTRAORDINARY FOLKS HERE THEY'RE GONNA. GET THEIR IMPRESSIONS REFLECTIONS OF ALLAH AND AND SOME OF THE DETAILS FROM THIS TASK FORCE WHERE. A DOCTOR BENTON. GET OUT OF THAT UP HERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE TODAY. I'M I'M JUST GOING TO START WITH BACKGROUND AND A FEW OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS AND THEN SANDY AND I WOULD WOULD ATTACK TEAM GENERALLY. SO SHE'S GOING TO DO SOME MORE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND SO THAT'S HOW WE'RE GONNA START. SO LET ME JUST PAINT A PICTURE. IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION FAMILY CAREGIVERS I DON'T KNOW WHO'S GOING TO BE DOING THIS LYFT. OKAY SO. IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION FAMILY CAREGIVERS. AND OF THAT 60% OF THESE CAREGIVERS ARE WOMEN. BUT REMEMBER THAT'S 40% WHO ARE MEN [INAUDIBLE] ON AVERAGE OUR CAREGIVERS ARE ABOUT FORTY NINE YEARS OLD. STILL IN THE WORK FORCE AND ABOUT ONE IN [INAUDIBLE] FOUR FEELS. 56% OF THESE CAREGIVERS ARE EMPLOYED AND ONE IN FOUR OF THE PEOPLE THAT THEY'RE CARRYING. FOR HAVE DEMENTIA. AND THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF TIME PEOPLE STAY IN THIS ROLE IS ABOUT FOUR YEARS. SO FOR CALIFORNIA. WHEN YOU ADD UP AND YOU LOOK AT THE CONTRIBUTION THE OF THE INFORMAL FAMILY CAREGIVER WE HAVE ABOUT FIFTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS? BEING ADDED TO OUR ECONOMY. EVERY YEAR AND THAT'S MORE THAN WHAT IS IN MEDI CAL IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC VALUE FOR THE CAREGIVER. SO WHAT CHALLENGES DO YOU FACE SOME PEOPLE ARE REALLY MENTION IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW FROM YOUR OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. THAT THERE ARE HEALTH IMPACTS FOR FAMILY CAREGIVERS. OF WHERE WE CAN THEY GET MUSCULAR DISEASE THAT IS THEY HAVE CARDIOVASCULAR PROBLEMS ONE OF THE OF PREVAILING THINGS THAT WE SEE A LOT IS DEPRESSION AMONG OUR CAREGIVERS. CLINICAL DEPRESSION AND HIGH SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION WHICH REALLY LOWERS YOUR ENERGY AND THINKING ABILITY. I ALSO HAVE A IN SOME POPULATIONS RESEARCHES EVEN POINTED OUT THAT THERE'S A HIGHER MORTALITY RATE FOR FAMILY CAREGIVERS ARE CARING FOR SOMEONE WITH DEMENTIA PARTICULARLY MALE CARE GIVERS. THE FISCAL IMPACT OF CAREGIVING IS THERE IS A HIGH OUT OF POCKET COST IN GENERAL AND THAT'S WHERE THINGS THAT ARE NOT COVERED. BY OTHER INSURANCE COMPANIES WE HAVE A LOT OF NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON EMPLOYMENT. OF THE SIDES ABSENTEEISM WE HAVE A LOT OF PRESS ANTI ISM SO FOR OUR EMPLOYERS THEY'RE LOOKING AT FOURTH THAT SOMETIMES IS THERE BUT THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS PRESENT. WE ALSO HAVE REDUCE SAVINGS OPPORTUNITIES. UP FOR ALL OF THE CAREGIVERS THAT ARE THERE SO THAT IN THE LONG RUN YOU'RE LOOKING AT IN THE IMPACT DOWN THE LINE ON THEIR OWN RETIREMENT ABILITIES. AND WE HAVE AN INCREASED RISK OF POVERTY BECAUSE MANY TIMES THE CARE GIVER MIGHT -- BE LIVING WITH THE OLDER ADULT ARE WITH THE FAMILY RELATIVE AND THEN WHEN THE RELATIVE PASSES AWAY AND THEY DON'T HAVE ANYWHERE TO GO AND THEY CAN END UP EVEN HOMELESS. AND WE HAVE SEEN THAT WITH THEIR CAREGIVERS [INAUDIBLE] SO. LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WE DID OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS BESIDES EAT VERY GOOD LUNCHES AND HER. ALMOST WITH XENA YEAH. AND THERE'S A LOT WE ALSO HAD WE ACTUALLY HAD A PROCESS OF DOING THINGS. I WAS SO WE STARTED WITH PRIORITY AREAS THAT WHERE I AM PRESENTED IN OUR INTERIM REPORT AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND SO WHAT WE DID IS WE LOOKED AT AN INTEGRATED APPROACH. TO CARE MANAGEMENT. AND WE REVIEWED INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPREHENSIVE ARRAY A CONTINUUM OF SERVICES THERE ARE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WE'D LOOK AT CARE GIVER COMPENSATION IN THAT REPORT AND THE DATA ON OUR CARE GIVERS AND SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE ALONG WITH EDUCATION AND AFFORDABILITY AND ACCESS TO SERVICES. SO OUR FIRST REPORT REALLY TRIBUTE OF VERY GOOD INVENTORY AND TRY TO FIND OUT YOU KNOW KIND OF WHAT COULD WE DO TOWARDS DEVELOPING OUR RECOMMENDATIONS WE REVIEWED ALL OF THOSE THINGS. WE'VE THEN I'M USED A VERY RESEARCH DRIVEN BECAUSE GUESS WHAT WE'RE IN A RESEARCH INSTITUTION. AND NOT SURPRISINGLY WE REALLY WANTED TO UNDERSTAND THINGS BY DOING SURVEYS LOOKING AT THE RESEARCH AND SO WE DID A REAL COMPILATION OF WHAT OTHER STATE TASK FORCE. THROUGHOUT THE NATION. OF WHAT THEY ARE AND THERE'S A WEBSITE WHERE YOU CAN GO AND SEE WHAT OTHER STATES HAVE BEEN DOING IN TERMS OF TASK FORCE WE DID A SURVEY OF AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA. FINDING OUT HOW THEY ARE WORKING WITH -- CURRENTLY WITH CAREGIVERS AND WHAT ARE SOME OF THE BEST PRACTICES THAT ARE SUGGESTED AND WE DID LOOK AT THE BEST PRACTICES AND POLICIES. THERE ARE WITHIN CALIFORNIA BUT ALSO ACROSS THE NATION SO THAT WE COULD REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT DO WE WANT TO INNOVATE HERE IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WE ARE GENERALLY THE INNOVATIVE STATE. AND WE WANT TO CONTINUE. SO. THE VALUES AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT -- WE FELT THAT THIS IS AS WE DID OUR TASK FORCE WE HAD CERTAIN VALUES THAT WE ARE GOING TO GO THROUGHOUT ALL OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS SO EVEN IF YOU DON'T HEAR THESE WORDS. THESE ARE ALWAYS PART OF OUR UNDERSTANDING IN VALUES THAT WE FEEL SHOULD BE PART OF ANY RECOMMENDATION FIRST OF ALL WE SUPPORTIVE VERY DIVERSE AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A VERY DIVERSE CARE GIVER NEEDS. AND WE TAKE NEED TO BE INCLUDING CULTURAL AWARENESS CULTURAL COMPETENCY AND SENSITIVITY IN ALL OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS IN FUTURE LEGISLATION. WE WANT TO EVERYTHING TO BE PERSON AND FAMILY CENTERED AND I THINK THAT ADDRESSES YOUR ISSUE ACROSS GENERATIONS TO THAT YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE FULL FAMILY. WE WANT THE OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS AND ANY FUTURE LEGISLATION TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE HAS TO BE A WORK LIFE BALANCE IF YOU LOOK AT THE AVERAGE AGE. THESE ARE STILL WORKING AND PEOPLE AND SO THE CAREGIVERS ARE GENERALLY WORKING AT BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT WORK LIFE BALANCE. AND WE WANT CHOICE AND OPTIONS FOR CAREGIVERS CARE GIVER DOWN IS SOMETHING THAT SOMETIMES YOU'RE. A BECOME A CAREGIVER BECAUSE SO MUCH IS TAG YOU'RE IT -- GENERALLY IT COMES FROM THE HEART BUT YOU SHOULD ALSO HAVE THE OPTION OF SAYING. MAYBE I'M NOT THE BEST PERSON. TO SO. GIVEN THOSE ARE I USE THAT WE WANT TO HAVE ACROSS ALL OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND PLEASE REMEMBER THIS FOR FUTURE LEGISLATION. OF I'M GONNA GO OVER SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS SO THE FIRST RECOMMENDATION AT THEIR NOT IN ANY PARTICULAR ORDER. I'VE DISCOVERED THAT AND HIS OLDEST CFO'S IF IT PLEASE DON'T TAKE THIS LIKE ALL THAT'S NUMBER. ONE OKAY SO THEY'RE NOT IN ANY ORDER BUT OUR FIRST THING WAS TO LOOK AT OF OUR FIRST RECOMMENDATION FROM THE TASK FORCE CAME OUT TO SUPPORT THE FINANCIAL WELL BEING. OF FAMILY CAREGIVERS. AND LIMIT THE EXTENT TO WHICH THIS ROLE CONTRIBUTES TO AN INCREASED RISK OF POVERTY. AND LONG TERM FINANCIAL INSECURITY. SO HOW MIGHT YOU GO ABOUT DOING THAT IS A LEGISLATOR WELL. ONE THING WE FELT AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THE LITTLE PICTURE ON THE SIDE OF THE NEXT SLIDE. A YES VOTE YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE THAT'S FUZZY BUT YOU HAVE THIS IN YOUR PACKET. IS JUST FOR COLOR [INAUDIBLE] BOB. SO HOW CAN YOU GO ABOUT ME OF MAKING THAT RECOMMENDATION TO REALITY WE HAD SOME SUGGESTIONS WOULD BE A TAX CREDIT. FOR THE HIGH OUT OF POCKET COST OF CARE GIVERS IN SO SOME WAY LOOKING AT THAT. PERHAPS IT COULD BE A STIPEND OR SIMILAR PROGRAM TO SUPPORT CARE GIVERS WITH THE COST OF COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES. AND THIRDLY AND THEIR MANY MORE THEY CAN GO FOR BUT THESE ARE LIKE OUR TOP THREE RECOMMENDATIONS. AND BUILD ON OUR FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE ACT AND PAID FAMILY LEAVE LAWS THAT WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO THAT WE CAN REALLY AND ONE WAY IS JUST. VERY SIMPLY WORKING WITH INCREASING AWARENESS OF THESE EXISTING PROGRAMS OF AND SO CLOSER. OUR FIRST LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATIONS NOW SOME OF THE THINGS PARTICULARLY FOR THIS LAST OF THE OF PAID FAMILY LEAVE LAWS WE JUST WANT TO POINT OUT. THAT THERE ARE CHALLENGES WITH THE CURRENT LEAVE LAWS WHERE WE HAVE ABOUT 40% OF WORKERS WHO ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR LEAVE LAW SO WE CAN LOOK AT THAT LEGISLATIVELY. AND WE DO KNOW THAT THERE'S A VERY HIGH LACK OF AWARENESS AMONG HR PROFESSIONALS AND EMPLOYERS. ABOUT THE LEAVE LAWS SO THAT WE HAVE A ONLY ABOUT 10% OF THE CURRENT CLAIMS ARE BEING USED BY PAID FAMILY CAREGIVERS WHERE THE BULK OF THE CLAIMS FOR OF PAID FAMILY LEAVE. ARE AROUND MATERNITY LEAVE. AND WE KNOW THAT THEIR MORE CARE GIVERS AND THAT 10% REFLECTS WHO ARE WORKING. THE NEXT RECOMMENDATION FROM THE TASK FORCE IS TO MODERNIZE AND STANDARDIZE CARE GIVER ASSESSMENTS ACROSS THE STATE. TO SUPPORT INDIVIDUALIZATION OF SERVICES. REDUCE SERVICE FRAGMENTATION AND INCREASED KNOWLEDGE OF WHO AMONG CARE GIVERS. I IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA USE OUR SKIRTS SERVICES. SO WITH THIS RECOMMENDATION WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE HERE IS THAT THAT INDIVIDUALIZATION BECAUSE IF YOU'VE MET ONE CAREGIVER YOU HAVE MET ONE CAREGIVER. AND SO YOU REALLY DO HAVE TO HAVE A SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS FOR THAT. HOW CAN WE GO ABOUT THIS LEGISLATIVELY WELL SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS WE WOULD MAKE WOULD BE TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A STANDARDIZED ASSESSMENT? TO OF THEY COULD BE USED ACROSS THE STATE INCREASED FUNDING FOR ANY TYPE OF CARE GIVER ASSESSMENT USUALLY THE ASSESSMENT PIECE MAY NOT EVEN BE PAID FOR WITH THE END. OF A SYSTEM. WE COULD COLLECT REPRESENTATIVE SURVEY DATA ON CARE GIVERS IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE CAN REMOVE BARRIERS ACROSS AGENCIES THAT INHIBITS SAFE RETURN OF PEOPLE WITH AN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY OR COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT WHICH ALLOWS THE CARE GIVER THE KID THEY FAMILY. TO FIND THAT PERSON AND AND CONTINUE THEIR CARE EASIER. THE LAST RECOMMENDATION THAT I'LL BE ON PRESENTING AND THEN I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER TO SANDY. IS THAT WE WOULD LIKE WE FEEL THAT THERE SHOULD BE A WAY TO CREATE A STATEWIDE ADVISORY COUNCIL. ON MATTERS AFFECTING FAMILY CAREGIVERS. THAT PROVIDES ADVICE ON INTEGRATING CAREGIVER ISSUES ACROSS THE STATE. DEPARTMENT'S SERVICES. INITIATIVES AND PROGRAMS AND PROVIDE POLICY EXPERTISE TO THE LEGISLATOR. SO I LEGISLATION SO THAT MONEY IS. AS THEIR WAY FOR US TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A REAL FOCUS. ON CAREGIVING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH PEOPLE THAT ARE HAVE THAT PASSION AND DEDICATION AT THE LEGISLATIVE LEVEL ON EVEN WITH AN AGENCY. AND THE OTHER THING I DID WANT TO POINT OUT IS THAT WHAT WE DO WILL BE ANTICIPATING. IS THAT WE WILL BE PUTTING TOGETHER -- WE'VE DECIDED AS A SUBCOMMITTEE EVEN THOUGH WE'RE USUALLY FINISHED WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE MORE TIME. AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL BE PUTTING TOGETHER A LEGISLATIVE PACKET. WITH ABOUT FIVE TO SEVEN LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES THAT WE WILL INTRODUCE TO THE LEGISLATION THIS FALL AFTER OUR STRATEGIC PLANNING SESSION. THAT HAS BEEN GENEROUSLY OFFERED TO BE HOSTED BY AARP. OF IN THE NEXT CULT FEW MONTHS THANK YOU. I DON'T THINK YOUR FRIENDS OF THING IS GOING STARTED YEAH [INAUDIBLE] YEAH. AND WE DO HAVE UNTIL THE END OF THE MONTH. WE DO HAVE ANOTHER THIRTY FIRST OF JULY. SOMEONE IN OUR GROUP TODAY IS THAT YOU DON'T SAY GOODBYE TO SAY HELLO SO I GUESS THAT'S THE REAL HURRY NATURE OF THIS. CHAIR KALRA LET ME BEGIN BY THANKING YOU FOR YOUR STEADFAST LEADERSHIP TO THIS COMMITTEE FOR YOUR INTERESTS AND TODAY'S TOPIC AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER I'M COME LUGGAGE THAT WE SAW EXCITED TO HAVE YOU JOIN US THANK YOU. AS A STARTED ON AS YOU KNOW I'M EVERYONE ELSE IN THIS ROOM THAT CAREGIVER JOURNEY IS VERY UNIQUE AND VERY PERSONAL. AND OF THE FIRST SLIDE WE JUST THAT PERFECT WE JUST HEARD ON COMMISSIONER BROWN STORY OF FAMILY CAREGIVING TO LET HER TO ADVOCATE FOR THE RESOLUTION. SO IT WAS A TWO YEAR EFFORT AS PEOPLE HAD ALREADY STATED AND THE FINAL REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ON JULY ONE WHICH WE DID SO THAT PART IS DONE NEXT LIKE. THE STRUCTURE OF THE TASK FORCE ON THE WORK THAT DONNA DESCRIBED ALL AND COMPLIED WITH THE RESOLUTION. THE TWELVE MEMBERS WERE APPOINTED BY THE ASSEMBLY SPEAKER IN THE SENATE PRESS TAMS SIX EACH. OUTSIDE FUNDING WHICH WAS A CONDITION OF THE RESOLUTION WAS SECURED FROM A. R. P. CALIFORNIA AND ARCHED ON FOUNDATION BOTH OF WHICH ARE HERE TODAY WITH US AS WELL. AND THE LETTER DAVIS SCHOOL OF GERONTOLOGY RIGHT HERE AT USC PROVIDED THE ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT [INAUDIBLE] SLIDE. THE TASK FORCE HAD A VARIETY OF OF TASKS TO COMPLETE SO IT NEEDED TO EXAMINE THE CHALLENGES FACED BY FAMILY CAREGIVERS AND EXAMINE THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT EXISTED. TO IMPROVE CAREGIVER SUPPORT ACROSS OUR STATE TO REVIEW THE CURRENT NETWORK. AND USE THAT KNOWLEDGE TO INFORM THE LEGISLATURE AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS [INAUDIBLE] SLIDE. THE TASK FORCE MEMBERS BROUGHT A VARIETY OF PERSPECTIVES TO THE WORK. THEIR PERSONAL EXPERIENCES THEIR PROFESSIONAL WORK AND THE ACADEMIC RESEARCH COMBINED TO INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME OF THE REPORT [INAUDIBLE] FIGHT. THE LETTER DAVIS SCHOOL OF GERONTOLOGY SERVED AS THE NON STATE THAT'S KINDA FUNNY LABEL BUT THAT WAS THE LABEL IN THE RESOLUTION NON STATE ORGANIZATION. PROVIDING ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT THE ADMINISTRATIVE AND RESEARCH TEAM IS LED BY DR KATE WILBUR WAS SPECIAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF DOCTORAL CANDIDATE KILEY MEYER WHO'S TAKING CARE OF OUR SLIDES TODAY. AND HER ROLE IN ALL THE LOGISTICS THE VALUE OF THIS ACADEMIC PARTNER CANNOT BE UNDERSTATED AND IT WAS IMPACTFUL TO THE WORK THAT WE DEAD. THE USC TEAM PROVIDED ALL THE LOGISTICS NECESSARY TO COORDINATE THIS TASK FORCE FOR TWO YEARS. THEY GAVE US RESEARCHERS WITH COMPLIMENTARY SKILL SETS AND OF COURSE THE INSTITUTIONAL CREDIBILITY AND THE BRANDING OF THE CALLER. NEXT SLIDE EPOCHAL. GOVERNMENT A GOLDEN BLUR ARE YEAH HOLDEN -- SO WE ACCEPT THAT CAREGIVING CAN BE HARD WORK. AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT EDUCATION AND INFORMATION AND TRAINING CAN MITIGATE THOSE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES. RECOMMENDATION NUMBER. THREE EQUIPPED CAREGIVERS WITH EASILY ACCESSIBLE INFORMATION EDUCATION AND TRAINING. THAT IS SPECIFIC TO THEIR SITUATION. AS PROVIDED IN CULTURALLY COMPETENT AND RELEVANT WAYS KINDA TOOK YOUR WHOLE SPEECH ACQUIT RIGHT INTO THAT RESOLUTION THANK YOU. THE NEEDS OF CAREGIVERS VERY BROADLY. WITH 80% OF CAREGIVERS AND 80% OF THE CARE GIVERS INDICATING THEY NEED AND WANT MORE INFORMATION ON CARE GIVING. SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THE CAREGIVER SPACE WHEN THEY TRY TO ACCESS INFORMATION ARE THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY CENTRALIZED. ITS NOT TAILORED TO MEET THE UNIQUE NEEDS. IT'S NOT AVAILABLE AS THE NEEDS AND THE FAMILY CHANGE DUE TO MORE COMPLEX CARE THAT'S REQUIRED. AND AS WE KNOW THE CARE GIVERS FROM BY FOR RACIAL ETHNIC CULTURAL GROUPS DO NOT NECESSARILY ACCESS INFORMATION AT THE SAME RIGHT ARE THE SAME EXTENT AS OTHER CAREGIVERS. HERE'S OUR ACTIONABLE IS FOR THE LIST OVER THERE BEAR IF YOU'RE KEEPING THE ACTIONABLE AROUND RECOMMENDATION. THREE THE CHAIRMAN WAYS THAT ALLOW US TO INCREASE ACCESS TO PERSONALIZED AND FAMILY CENTERED MATERIALS. PROVIDE CULTURALLY COMPETENT MATERIALS. AN INCREASE FUNDING TO THE CAREGIVER RESOURCE CENTERS TARGETED FOR EDUCATION AND TRAINING. RECOMMENDATION NUMBER. FOUR INCREASE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE CAREGIVERS SERVICES AND SUPPORTS INCLUDING RESPITE. THIS WAS REALLY I AM BROUGHT HOME TO US REPEATEDLY BY TASK FORCE MEMBERS AND ALSO AS IN THE SURVEY THAT WE DID THE OF ACCESSIBILITY AND AFFORDABILITY OF SERVICES. RESPITE SERVICES AS MOST OF YOU NOW IN THIS IN THIS AUDIENCE THEY PROVIDE THAT IMPORTANT BREAK. FROM CARE GIVING WHETHER IT'S PLANNED OR BECAUSE OF AN EMERGENCY SITUATION. IT'S ONE OF THE MOST SOUGHT OUT A SERVICES AND IT ONLY 15% OF CAREGIVERS ARE ABLE TO USE OUR ACCESS THAT KIND OF SERVICE. OTHER KIND OF BARRIERS THAT INTERFERE WITH OUR SERVICE AND SUPPORT NETWORK FOR CAREGIVERS HAS TO DO WITH THE AVAILABILITY CRITICALLY ACUTE IN OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES I COME OUT OF A RURAL COMMUNITY AND I KNOW THAT TO BE. TRUE. SHORTAGE OF QUALIFIED PROVIDERS WHICH SPEAKS TO ALL OF THE OTHER WORKFORCE ISSUES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CONSTANTLY. AND THE COST. ACTIONABLE IS AROUND RECOMMENDATION FOR DIRECTIONS FOR LEGISLATION OR OTHER ADVOCACY WORK. INCREASE THE NUMBER OF RESPITE PROVIDERS BY ALLOCATING INCREASE FUNDING. AND EXPAND ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE REST RESPITE SERVICES EITHER BY CONSIDERING TRAINED VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS AS AN APPROACH. AND OUR EXTENDED SERVICES ON THE SLIDING SCALE LIKE WE SOMETIMES DO WITH OTHER PROGRAMS. THE NEXT NIGHT. NEARLY 50% OF FAMILY CAREGIVERS MIGHT NOT KNOW THIS YOU MIGHT IT MIGHT BE ONE OF THE IS NEARLY THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY ASSISTING WITH PROVIDING MEDICAL CARE. TO THEIR FAMILY MEMBER WHETHER THAT IS MEDICATION MANAGEMENT WHETHER IT'S WORTH CARE WHETHER IT'S PREPARING SPECIAL DIETS. ON THIS IS DUE TO INCREASINGLY COMPLEX AND ACUTE CONDITIONS. DIAGNOSIS THAT A PERSON MAY HAVE THAT REQUIRES THEM TO USE A CAREGIVER. OR IT MAY BE LINKED TO A HOSPITAL DISCHARGE. CAREGIVERS SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED AS KEY MEMBERS OF THE HEALTHCARE TEAM. AND YET WE KNOW THEIR ROLE IS OFTEN UNDER RECOGNIZED. RECOMMENDATION NUMBER FIVE BUT BACK. BUT THE FACT THAT CATCH ME RECOMMENDATION NUMBER. FIVE INTEGRATE CAREGIVERS IN THE HOSPITAL PROCESSES. SUPPORT THEM AND NAVIGATING AND TARA AND CARE TRANSITIONS AND WITH PROVIDING CARE AS IT GETS MORE COMPLEX IN THEIR SITUATION. AND RECOGNIZES DONNA SAID EARLIER THE CAREGIVER'S CHOICE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN AND ARE COMFORTABLE WITH DOING COMPLEX CARE NEEDS. SO HOW DO WE GET TO THIS RECOMMENDATION THE ACTIONABLE IS AROUND RECOMMENDATION NUMBER. FIVE BRING CALIFORNIA ALIGNED WITH OTHER STATES. AND ALLOW NURSES TO DELEGATE SOME PASSED A QUALIFIED HOME HEALTH PROVIDERS. HOSPITAL DISCHARGE PLANNING IS OFTEN MISSED OPPORTUNITIES. TO PROVIDE THE SUPPORT FOR FAMILY CAREGIVERS. STANDARD PROTOCOLS AND PROCEDURES AT HOSPITAL DISCHARGE SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED AND INCLUDE FAMILY CAREGIVERS ONCE THAT CAREGIVER IS IDENTIFIED. ENHANCE CURRENT PROVISIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL IN FAMILY CAREGIVER LA. SO THAT YOU ALLOW A PATIENT TO DECLARE MORE THAN ONE CAREGIVER SOMEONE SAID TAG YOU'RE IT WILL SOMETIMES TAKE MULTIPLES ARE IT. AND IF THE FORMS DON'T ALLOW YOU TO CREATE MULTIPLE CAREGIVERS MISCOMMUNICATION CAN OCCUR WITHIN THE HOME SETTING. AND ENSURE ACCESS TO TELEHEALTH FOR BOTH CAREGIVERS AND RECIPIENTS [INAUDIBLE] ASIDE. CALIFORNIA WAS THE FIRST STATE OF THE NATION TO ADDRESS THE IMPACT OF COGNITIVE DISORDERS ON FAMILIES WITH THE CREATION OF THE CAREGIVER RESOURCE CENTER NETWORK. THE ELEVEN CAREGIVER RESOURCE CENTER SERVICE A POINT OF ENTRY. SERVICES AVAILABLE FOR CARE GIVING FAMILIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. WELL EACH CENTER TAILORS IT'S ITS WORK TO THE OBJECT GRAPHIC AREA AT SERVICE. WE KNOW THE ALL ELEVEN OF THE CAREGIVER RESOURCES HAVE A CARE COMPONENT OF PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE INFORMATION. EDUCATION AND SUPPORT. GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURE. FOR THE CAREGIVER RESOURCE CENTERS IS CURRENTLY AT THREE PLUS BILLION [INAUDIBLE] REPRESENTING. A 74% DECREASE FROM THE TWO THOUSAND NINE LEVEL. RECOMMENDATION NUMBER SIX INCREASE FUNDING TO CALIFORNIA'S CAREGIVER RESOURCE CENTERS SO THAT THEY CAN. SPAN SERVICES NEXT. UP THE BACK I'M IS THAT SO THAT SO THAT THE RESOURCE CENTERS CAN EXPANSIVENESS TO MEET THE GROWING DEMAND AS YOU ALL SET BY AN INCREASE IN AGING POPULATION. ADMINISTER CAREGIVER ASSESSMENTS BY BY PROFESSIONALS. EXPAND RESPITE CARE VIA RECOMMENDATIONS WE MADE EARLIER. PROVIDE EVIDENCE BASED EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROGRAMS AND SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF INNOVATIVE AND COST EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS. AS I WIND UP AND WE COMPLETE THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT'S A GOOD LAUNDRY LIST. MAYBE TOO MUCH OF A LAUNDRY LIST DONNA PROMISED YOU FIVE OR SEVEN AS WE CONTINUE TO BRING THAT WE FIND THOSE AND BRING THOSE BACK. SO I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE ON THE NEXT SLIDE THAT THERE ARE TWO GOVERNMENTAL FUNDED CAREGIVER SUPPORT PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA. THE TOP ONE IS AN EIGHTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS EVER TAKE FEDERAL FUNDS OF THE OLDER AMERICANS ACT. AWARDED TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF AGING DISTRIBUTION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR CAREGIVERS SUPPORT REFERRAL ETCETERA. AND THE STATE GENERAL FUND AS WE JUST MENTIONED FLOW THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO THE CAREGIVER RESOURCE CENTERS. AT THE WORK OF THE TASK FORCE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT THE GENEROSITY THE VISION AND THE COMMITMENT OF OUR CHIU FUNDERS. AARP CALIFORNIA AND I STONE FOUNDATION WE ARE SO APPRECIATIVE OF YOUR WORK. MURRAY OF THE PROCESS OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS IS JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG THAT WHOLE BIG DOCUMENT HAS MANY MORE RECOMMENDATIONS THE RATIONALE THAT YOU WOULD NEED. SO TODAY MISTER CHAIR MEMBER. WE UNDERSTAND WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU TO ADVANCE THESE -- RECOMMENDATIONS AND PROPOSALS ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA'S MANY FAMILY CAREGIVERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SANDY DR BENTON FOR GOING OVER THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS -- OFFICIALLY BUT I THINK OF GREAT THOROUGHNESS AS WELL AS THANK YOU BOTH SO MUCH. R. MOVEON DE ET OUT COMING FROM. MY NECK OF THE WOODS OF NORTH A DISCUSS ISSUES OF DIVERSITIES A DIVERSITY ISSUES IN CAREGIVING. THANK YOU CHAIR -- KALRA AND ALSO ASSEMBLY. COM LAGER DOVE -- SO FIRST OF ALL I JUST WANNA SAY THAT. EVERYONE WHO TAKES ON THE CAREGIVING ROLE DOES IT OUT OF LOVE MOST PEOPLE DO IT OUT OF LOVE ADAM AND THEY WANT THE BEST CARE FOR THEIR FAMILY MEMBER -- AND THIS CUTS ACROSS ALL RACES ALL ETHNICITIES PRETTY MUCH ALL SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION. BUT THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN FACT THERE ARE STUDIES THAT ARE SHOWING THAT LATINOS SPEND MORE TIME. IN CAREGIVING THAN ALL THE OTHER GROUPS -- LGBT INDIVIDUALS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BECOME CAREGIVERS MAN. SOMETIMES BY DEFAULT BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE CHILDREN AND THEREFORE IT'S ASSUME THAT YOU'LL BE THE CAREGIVER FOR MOM AND DAD -- AND THEY ARE ALSO MORE LIKELY TO DELAY SEEKING OUT SERVICES DUE TO DISCRIMINATION OR FEAR OF DISCRIMINATION. WE'VE ALSO FOUND THAT AFRICAN AMERICANS AND LATINOS SPEND A HIGHER PROPORTION OF THEIR INCOME ON OUT OF POCKET CARE. THAN WHITES IN CAUCASIAN AND OF WHITES AND ASIANS SO 44% VERSUS I'M. I THINK THE YOU KNOW AND EVEN THOSE WHO ARE FINANCIALLY ABLE TO CARE FOR THEIR LOVED. ONE IT IS EXTREMELY COST PROHIBITIVE AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE SAW WHICH IS TO LOOK AT ON THE FINANCIAL COST OF CARE GIVING. ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT -- YOU'RE ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WAS TO EQUIP CAREGIVERS WITH EARLY ACCESSIBLE INFORMATION AND TRAINING -- AND YOU KNOW CARE GIVERS ARE AT RISK OF BURNOUT AND DEPRESSION AS WAS ALLUDED EARLIER. AND IT'S EVEN HARDER FOR CAREGIVERS WHO ARE OF A PARTICULAR UNDER REPRESENTED GROUPS TO LOOK FOR SERVICES TO SEEK OUT INFORMATION AND SO MAKES IT THAT MUCH HARDER FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY ACCESS SERVICES THAT MAY BE READILY AVAILABLE. BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE TO LOOK OR IT THAT INFORMATION IS NOT AVAILABLE THE FOR EXAMPLE THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE ACT IF THERE'S INFORMATION ABOUT IT AT THEIR WORKPLACE. BUT IT'S NOT IN SPANISH THEY HAVE NO IDEA THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY ACCESS THIS PARTICULAR. ITEM PROGRAM. LIKEWISE IF SOMEONE HAS A PARTICULAR -- CONDITION AND THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO PROVIDE CARE FOR THAT CONDITION OF IT'S NOT AVAILABLE IN LANGUAGE OR IN SOME WAY THAT THEY CAN UNDERSTAND IT IT MAKES IT THAT MUCH HARDER. I AM SO IT'S REALLY CRITICAL THAT ANY SERVICES WE PROVIDE DO IT DOES HAVE THAT CULTURAL RELEVANCE TO IT AND THERE ARE SOME PROGRAMS IN THE STATE THAT DO A GREAT JOB OF PROVIDING. SERVICES THAT ARE TAILORED IN SUCH A WAY BUT WE NEED MORE OF THAT AND WE NEED MORE MATERIALS IN IN VARIOUS LANGUAGES -- I OTHERS CAN HAVE GIVES SOME REAL LIFE EXAMPLES -- YOU KNOW LAST YEAR I TALKED WITH THE LEGISLATIVE AIDE WHO WAS -- ACTUALLY TALKING TO US ABOUT HER OWN FATHER WHO HAD A DEMENTIA AND SHE WAS WONDERING WHAT SERVICES ARE OUT THERE AND SHE HAD EXPLORED ALL THE SERVICES. BUT ULTIMATELY SHE DECIDED THAT YOU KNOW THE BEST THING IS PROBABLY FOR ME TO SEND MY FATHER BACK TO KOREA. NOT BECAUSE THERE ARE BETTER SERVICES THERE BUT BECAUSE SHE KNEW THAT HE WOULD AT LEAST BE AROUND PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTOOD THE CULTURE AND THE LANGUAGE. AND THAT IS NOT UNCOMMON TO MANY MANY CAREGIVERS IN CALIFORNIA MAY END UP SENDING THEIR LOVED ONE BACK TO THEIR COUNTRY OF ORIGIN FOR THIS VERY REASON -- AND SIMILARLY -- YOU KNOW CHARLES CHO WHO WAS THAT. NOBEL PRIZE WINNER -- THEY LIVED IN MOUNTAIN VIEW UP IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND WE ARE YOU KNOW THE WIFE DID AS BEST AS SHE COULD TO PROVIDE THE CARE BUT AND LOOKED AT ALL THE SERVICES AROUND. IT WAS REALLY HARD THEY COULD AFFORD THE CARE BUT IT WAS VERY HARD FOR THEM TO LOOK FOR SERVICES AND ULTIMATELY THEY TO DECIDE TO MOVE BACK TO HONG KONG. AGAIN NOT BECAUSE THERE ARE THERE BETTER SERVICES THERE FOR ALZHEIMERS OR DEMENTIA BUT AGAIN BECAUSE OF THAT CULTURAL NATURE OF IT. SO I THINK WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT CALIFORNIA AND YOU KNOW ALL THE INNOVATION AND THE PROGRESSIVENESS WE HAVE HERE. A CAN CERTAINLY BE A SINKHOLE FOR CAREGIVERS EMOTIONALLY FINANCIALLY AND SOCIALLY. ARM YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT HOME SO. THE HIGHLIGHT HERE IS REALLY AROUND THE CULTURALLY TAILORED EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS BUT YOU NOTICE AGAIN THINKING ABOUT WHATEVER IT IS THAT WE DO OUR THAT WE REALLY LOOK AT THE DIVERSITY OF OUR OF OUR STATE OF THE CAREGIVERS AROUND AND INCLUDING OUR LGBT CHARACTERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THEM GREAT POINTS PLEA AGREE. OTHER EN DIE I THINK IT SAID APPROPRIATE AROUND THIS OUT. IF THE DOCTOR KATHLEEN WILBUR I HEAR USC AJAY DISCUSS EMERGING FAMILY CAREGIVER CHALLENGES. SO I THANK YOU CHAIRMAN KALRA AND NUMBER CAN LINGER DOT OF AND I WANT TO START BY SAYING HOW GRATEFUL I AM TO LIVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHERE WE HAVE AMAZING LEADERSHIP WHO CARES ABOUT? OF PROVIDING BASIC SERVICES AND THE HUMAN DIGNITY OF ALL OUR RESIDENTS SO -- WE START FROM A GOOD PLACE AND WE START FROM A PLACE OF LEADERSHIP. ARM I ALSO WANT TO THANK COMMISSIONER BROWN FOR HER VISION AND LEADERSHIP IN MAKING -- THIS. PROGRAM A REALITY AND OF COURSE AS THE OTHER PANEL MEMBERS THE A A RP AND ARCHED ON FOUNDATIONS FOR THEIR CHEN SUPPORT. THAT MADE THIS ALL HAPPENED I WANT TO THANK AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE HARD WORKING TASK FORCE MEMBERS. A AND THE LEADERSHIP OF DONNA BENTON. AND SANDY FITS PATRICK. SANDY FITS PATRICK AND THE SUPPORT OF KILEY WHO HAS BEEN MENTIONED BEFORE [INAUDIBLE] SO. A LITTLE BIT PREACHING TO THE CHOIR HERE BUT CAREGIVING IS A UNIVERSAL ISSUE AND AS FORMER FIRST LADY ROSALYNN CARTER SAID. THERE'S FOUR KINDS OF PEOPLE. THOSE WHO WILL BE CARE GIVERS. THOSE WHO ARE CAREGIVERS THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN CARE GIVERS AND THOSE WHO WILL BE CARE RECEIVERS. AND FOR MANY OF US IF WE LIVE LONG ENOUGH WILL BE SEVERAL OF THOSE ARE. SEVERAL OF THOSE [INAUDIBLE] SO [INAUDIBLE] I'M. TRYING TO GET MY HEAD AROUND. WHAT'S FIFTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS LOOK LIKE THAT'S WHAT CAREGIVERS CONTRIBUTE SO OF IF YOU WOULD PUT THE SLIDE UP THINKING ABOUT THAT. I CALIFORNIA STATE MEDI CAL LOOKS TO BE ABOUT THIRTY BILLION AYE ANNUAL APPLE -- PROFITS. MY MERE FORTY ONE BILLION. THE GDP OF CROATIA WHO WAS THE RUNNER UP IN THE WORLD CUP. FIFTY SIX BILLION. SO HERE WE ARE OF THE CARE GIVER OF CONTRIBUTION IS MORE. THAN ALL OF THOSE [INAUDIBLE] I'M. AND YOU'VE HEARD THIS AND YOU ALL KNOW IT BUT I THE STORY OF FAMILY CAREGIVING IS REPEATED EVERY DAY. ACROSS OUR STATE IN URBAN AND RURAL COMMUNITIES RICH AND POOR DIFFERENT KINDS OF FAMILIES DIFFERENT KINDS OF CARE GIVERS I'M. DONNA TALKED ABOUT PRESENT TURGEON ISM THAT. SOUND LIKE A RELIGION HAS. DONE SO -- THE NEXT SLIDE US SO I HAD TO GO TO THE DENTIST RECENTLY TO GET A CROWN AND I PUT IT OFF AND FINALLY HAD TO DO IT. AND YOU KNOW HOW YOU KIND OF PRIME THE DENTIST. AND HAVE YOU BEEN CAMPING LATELY BECAUSE I KNOW HE LIKES TO DO THAT. AND HE SAID NO HE HAD SPEND SPENDING NIGHT AND WEEKENDS CAREGIVING FOR HIS DYING FATHER WHO'S. SO I HAD CONCERNS ABOUT HIM AND I CONCERNS ABOUT ME THEM THINKING I AT KNOWING HOW EXHAUSTING AND THIS KIND OF WORK YEAH -- BUT I HAVE. I HAVE MY CROWN. YEAH BUT IT WAS FLYING AND AND I WANT TO FOLLOW UP WITH WITH HIM WITH OF THE WORK THAT HE'S DOING AND I LEARNED A LOT ABOUT HIS FATHER TO WHICH WAS VERY TOUCHING. MANY OF YOU I THINK ALMOST EVERYBODY HERE PROBABLY KNOWS FERNANDO TORRES GAL WHO'S BEEN A GREAT LEADER IN OUR STATE IN AND THE COUNTRY AN AGING FOR THE LAST FOUR DECADES. AND FAMILY A FERNANDO AND HIS EIGHT SIBLINGS [INAUDIBLE] WERE RAISED. BY A SINGLE MAMAN AND AS MANY OF YOU KNOW FERNANDO WHEN HE WAS SIX MONTHS OLD CONTRACTED POLIO HE SPENT A LOT OF HIS EARLY YEARS IN AND OUT OF THE HOSPITAL. ON ALL THE KIDS WENT TO COLLEGE THEY WERE ALL VERY SUCCESSFUL IN FERNANDO SAID SOMETHING I THOUGHT WAS REALLY COMPELLING WHICH IS. ONE MOM RAISE THOSE NINE KIDS BUT WHEN THE MOMMY TO CAREGIVING IN A AND THEY CAME FROM ALL OVER THE STATE AND THEY REARRANGED WORK AND THEY THEY SCHEDULED. AND HE SAID THAT NINE KIDS HAD A REALLY HARD TIME. TRYING TO MANAGE THE CAREGIVING FOR THE ONE MOM. AND I THINK THAT THAT REALLY SHOWS THE STRUGGLES THAT FAMILIES -- MAKE. THIS IS THE COMMUNITY CENTER BECAUSE FERNANDO'S MOM ALSO AFTER SHE RAISE THE NINE KIDS GAVE BACK A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF THE COMMUNITY. AND THEY RECOGNIZED HER BY NAMING A COMMUNITY CENTER AFTER. I'M NO ONE OR MANY OF US DON'T EXPECT TO BE A CAREGIVER AND WHILE OF THE TASK FORCE WAS DOING ITS WORK I UNEXPECTEDLY. BECAME A CAREGIVER FOR MY HUSBAND. WHO -- WAS DIAGNOSED WITH A TERMINAL ILLNESS. AND I HAD EVERY POSSIBLE GOOD CAREGIVING SUPPORT THAT YOU COULD HAVE FLEXIBLE WORK. ON FAMILY MEMBERS WILLING TO FILL IN REALLY GREAT OF PEOPLE THAT I WORK WITH ADEQUATE FINANCIAL. RESOURCES AND THIS CAREGIVING TIME WAS A GIFT. AND IT WAS REALLY REALLY HARD. AND IT SORT OF THINKING ABOUT IT. ARM ANY UNEXPECTED THINGS SO. ONE OF THE THINGS IS YOU DON'T MY HUSBAND ALWAYS SAID EVERYTHING THAT HE DID AND I ALWAYS LIKE. BUT IT TURNS OUT ALL THE THINGS HE DID FROM THE ERRANDS TO THE SHOPPING TO CHANGING THE KITTY LITTER TO OPENING JARS THAT WAS ALWAYS A PROBLEM. AND THEN THAT ALL GOES AWAY ON AND THEN -- TO TAKE ON ALL THAT YOU TAKE ON THE ROLE. AND MY HUSBAND WAS VERY. FAVORITE SPORTS WERE FOOTBALL. AND PAIRS SKATING. SORT OF A STRANGE COMBINATION NOT. BUT BUT ONE OF FOR ME I DID MEDICAL STOP FAN AND OF TELEHEALTH. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS THE HARDEST WAS TRANSFERRING IN A COUPLE OF NEAR MISSES. AND SO WE DECIDED TO MAKE TRANSFERRING AN OLYMPIC LIKE PAIRS SKATING ACTIVITY IN WHICH WE WOULD PLAN AND THEN WE WOULD RATE OURSELVES SO. I'M NOT. I HAVE TO SAY THIS DID NOT HAPPEN WE HAD A COUPLE OF THE NURSES. BUT I THINK THERE'S SO MANY THINGS AN ECHO EFFECT CAREGIVING ROLE. AND AND AS YOU SAID YOU'VE SEEN ONE CAREGIVER YOU SEEN ONE CAREGIVER AND PEOPLE WILL HAVE. I HOPE THAT YOU'LL HEAR FROM US SOON DIFFERENT STORIES BUT I THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT [INAUDIBLE] WHAT IF? ON I WERE AN HOURLY WORKER AND I HAD TO PUT IN THOSE HOURS TO GET PAID. I OR IF I HAD NO BENEFITS OR IF I HAD TO BALANCE IN MY GOING TO PAY THE RENT OR DO SOME OF THE OUT OF POCKET COSTS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN. OR TRADING OFF SOME OF THE CARE FOR HELPING MY KIDS WITH COLLEGE NONE OF THAT HAPPENED TO ME. IN MY CHOICES BUT YOU THINK ABOUT THE HARD CHOICES AND THE SACRIFICES AND WHAT PEOPLE. HAVE TO DO. AND I ALSO THINK ABOUT AND SEVERAL PEOPLE SAID TO ME WELL YOU COULD DO NURSING HOME PLACEMENT. I AM AND AGAIN AND KNOWING WHAT I KNOW IF IT WAS SHOCKING TO ME THAT THEY SAID IT BUT I UNDERSTAND AND I UNDERSTAND WHY FAMILIES HAVE TO DO IT. PARTICULARLY IF YOU DON'T GET CAL WHEN YOU'RE GIVING CARE IN THE HOME BUT YOU DO GET IT IN THE FACILITY. AND FACILITIES WHO ARE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS A DAY SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE MATTER CAL BECAUSE FOR PLACEMENT. HUGE AND ONE OF THE MAJOR -- HOLDING THE FORT AGAINST THOSE PLACEMENTS ARE THE FAMILY CAREGIVERS -- I'VE SEEN FAMILIES GET REPORTED TO A PS. BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T QUITE PATCHED TOGETHER ALL THE HOURS AND MOM DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO THE NURSING HOME. I'VE SEEN A WORKER RUSH HOME FROM HER HAIR SALON BECAUSE SHE COULDN'T FIND MOM. ON THE A OF THE MONITOR THAT HER HER APT MONITOR AND SO SHE WAS WORRIED. ON MY SEEN AS YOU'VE HEARD CAREGIVER SACRIFICE THEIR OWN HEALTH. I TRY TO CONTINUE THE CAREGIVING. I'M SO WE ALL KNOW THAT THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT COMPELLING ISSUE. AND THEY'RE HELPING SUPPORT FAMILY CAREGIVERS HELP SUPPORT. ALL OF US AND SUPPORT THAT STATE BUDGET. I'M SO THINKING ABOUT A NEXT DOUBTS. WE ARE ARE GOING TO GO AHEAD WITH THAT AARP -- RECOMMENDATIONS ARM BUT I ALSO WANTED -- TO SUGGEST [INAUDIBLE] THAT ALONE. CONTINUING THE WORK OF THE TASK FORCE AND PEOPLE IS SAID MAYBE AND AGENCY OR SOMETHING THAT CAN. PROVIDE SOME ONGOING INPUT SOME ACCOUNTABILITY. ON CAREGIVERS ARE EVERYWHERE BUT THEIR VOICES ARE OFTEN NOT HEARD ONE OF THE REASONS IS THEY'RE SO BUSY AND THEY'RE SO EXHAUSTED AND THEY ALSO THINK FAMILIES THINK THIS IS OUR JOB. THIS IS WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. AND I THINK THEY DON'T RECOGNIZE THAT THEY DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO DO IT. ALONE SO FAMILIES WILL DO BETTER CARE GIVING AND FOR LONGER AND WITH FEWER NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES IF WE CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPORT. THAT WAS IN THE POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS. AND I THINK TO CONTINUE TO HEAR THE VOICE OF THE CAREGIVERS WILL REALLY BE REALLY IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE IN DISABILITY COMMUNITY SAY NOTHING ABOUT US WITHOUT US. AND I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT THING HERE -- I WAS FORTUNATE RECENTLY TO GO TO EUROPE TO LOOK AT AGE FRIENDLY CITIES AND WHAT WE COULD LEARN FROM THEM AND ONE OF THE BIG TAKEAWAYS WAS THIS NOTION OF CO PRODUCTION. WHICH IS TO ENGAGE PEOPLE WHO WERE LIVING THE EXPERIENCE IN DEVELOPING. THE POLICIES IN THE PROGRAMS AND ADVANCING THINGS FORWARD. AND BECOMING CHAMPIONS OF BECOMING THE CHANGE THAT THEY WANTED TO SEE AND I LOVE THAT NOTION I THINK THAT RECOMMENDATIONS. ALSO LEAD TO THAT SO I THINK WE HAVE THIS ISSUE IT'S COMPELLING BUT ONE OF THE REASONS WE HAVE IT IS THE GREATEST I THINK ACHIEVEMENT -- IN THE TWENTIETH TWENTY FIRST CENTURY WHICH IS LONGEVITY. SO WE HAVE AN AGING POPULATION AND THAT'S A GOOD THING AND I THINK WE CAN MAKE IT EVEN BETTER THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR DOCTOR WILBUR AND BEFORE WE THANK OUR WONDERFUL PANEL HERE I JUST WANNA. A BETTER BUT YOU KNOW -- THAT WILL BE TAKING A FIVE MINUTE BREAK TO A TO A FIVE IS NOT HELPING TO SUPPORT TO LONG RIGHT. WE GET UP STRUGGLING UNDER THE IS RESTING HIS RESTROOM AND SPEAKING OF WHICH THERE ARE RESTROOMS OUTSIDE THEIR SIMPLY RUSSIANS OUTSIDE THE COURT YOUR TO THE RIGHT. OR YOU CAN GO ACROSS THE STREET TO RONALD TUTOR HALL THEIR RESTROOMS ON THE FIRST WHERE THERE. AND SO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY GETS UP IN THE NEXT FEW MINUTES LEASE MOVES AROUND TALK TO PEOPLE. ARE AND LET'S THANK THIS EXTRAORDINARY PANEL OF FOR HELPING INSTEAD FOCUS ON THANK YOU. AND THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS I THINK THAT I JUST ONE OF THE FIRST OF ALL THE PANEL IS FANTASTIC WHAT THEY SAID I CONCURRENT WITH 1100%. AND I DIDN'T CONCUR WITH THEM BEFOREHAND ON ON WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO SAY. BUT WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS. JEFF WHY WE HAD TO HAVE THIS TASK FORCE IN THE FIRST PLACE. BUT I THINK THAT WE NEED TO INTRODUCE ANY OF THE TASK MEMBERS. TASK FORCE MEMBERS THAT ARE HERE WHO'VE WORKED FOR TWO YEARS. TO DO THIS AND IF ANY OF THEM THAT ARE HERE. AND THE DONNA DOESN'T MY YEAH I WAS GONNA DO THAT VERY AND THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO DO IT I THINK BUT MY LOGIC OF THE FACT. THAT IF WE CAN HAVE ALL THE TASK FORCE MEMBERS PLEASE STAND UP YEAH. ALL THE BECAUSE OF A FEW AND LET'S THANK THEM FOR THE FINAL WORK IT IS. SOME OF WHOM HAD THEM LEAVE SO THAT THEY COULD DO CARE GIVING SOME PLAZA THE HELL THAT. AND I ALSO WANTED TO INTRODUCE A BETSY BUTLER WHO IS THE VICE CHAIR OF THE COMMISSION ON AGING IN PHILLY RIGHT OVER THERE OF THE SHE I CAN GO HOME. A POINT OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE WOULD BE. I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE THE LADIES THAT SAME WITH ME AND THAT SARAH GARCIA AND COMES FROM IMPERIAL COUNTY. DON'T FORGET HER COUNTY. EVITA DEAN WHO COMES FROM YUCCA VALLEY. AND SHE SAID PLEASE DON'T FORGET HER BECAUSE SHE'S OUT THERE. AND MARGARET MICKENS WHO IS IN SAMBOR MEDINA THEY'VE ALWAYS THEIR HANDS BACK WHERE THEY CAME WITH ME. LASTLY I'D LIKE -- TO JUST THE KIND OF TALK ABOUT A MINUTE WHAT. MORE RICO YAMADA DID. BEFORE BEFORE I CAME ON AS THE CHAIR SHE WAS THE CHAIR OF AGING AND LONG TERM CARE. AND WHAT SHE DID ONE YEAR WAS TO SAY. THE YOU KNOW WE ONLY GOT A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THIS WHOLE BUDGET OF ALL THESE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS BENEFIT WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT. SHE SAID WE GOT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND SHE WAS SO DISMAYED ABOUT IT. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS SHE WAS ABLE TO DO. AND WE DID TOGETHER WAS A THING CALLED FACES OF A KING. AND IF YOU GO BACK AND LOOK AT THAT REPORT. ALL OF THE THINGS THAT THEY'VE BEEN SAYING ABOUT LGBT ABOUT -- AFRICAN AMERICANS ABOUT. EVERYONE ASIANS YOU'LL FIND IT IN THAT PARTICULAR REPORT BECAUSE WE DID A SERIES. PUBLIC HEARINGS ON THAT. AND I WANT TO SAY THANKS AGAIN TO YOU.

WE KNOW FOR SURE THAT SHE HAD ALL THE THE REAL -- TELLTALE SYMPTOMS WHICH DEFTLY TURNED OUT TO BE TRUE. SO. OF INNOCENCE THAT WAS THE BEGINNING OF OUR OUR JOURNEY HE SAID. IT ALL I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW IS GO OUT AND LIVE YOUR LIFE -- BECAUSE AS I'M SURE MOST OF YOU NOW THEIR THERE'S NO NO BECAUSE WERE KNOWN CURE AT THAT TIME NOR IS THERE FORTY FIVE YEARS LATER.

WE WHAT I CONSIDER MY JOURNEY FROM JUST BEING A HUSBAND A FATHER TO LIKE LIKE PHASE ONE OF BEING A CAREGIVER [INAUDIBLE] ARE. AND AT THAT POINT OF TIME IS WHEN WE ARE WIDENING DOORWAYS -- YEAH. ADJUSTED TOILETS ARE GOT RAMPS IN THE HOUSE A STEER. STEER LEFT GOING THE SECOND FLOOR AND DOG ELECTRIC WHEELCHAIRS AT CENTER SO -- THAT WAS THE BEGINNING OF IT ALL ARE. ONE THING I JUST WANT TO SAY THOUGH THAT EVEN THOUGH OF SHE DIDN'T. I DECLINED A PHYSICALLY REAL FAST THERE WERE THERE WERE STILL YOU KNOW THE GRADUAL DECLINE AS WELL AS A LOT OF EMOTIONAL ROLLERCOASTER. THAT YOU YOU ALSO GET WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS SO WE HAD WE HAD TO DEAL WITH THAT WHICH IF WE HAVE LONG TERM EFFECTS WHICH I'LL GET INTO A LITTLE BIT LATER SO -- YOU'RE KIDDING HAS MANY PEOPLE SAY CARE GIVING IN REGARDLESS OF THE SITUATION USUALLY. ARE. IT ACTUALLY COMES IN PHASES AND ARE THE NATURE OF THE ILLNESS OR DISEASE REALLY DICTATES -- WHERE YOU AT WITH YOUR YOUR POINT OF CARE AT THAT POINT OF TIME [INAUDIBLE] OF SO. WHAT WOULD DONE IT WE DECIDED TO DO [INAUDIBLE] WAS IRAN [INAUDIBLE] JUST. COULD A LIKE IF THEY CONTINUE ON WITH OUR LIFE I WAS I WAS A SALESPERSON FOR MEDICAL COMPANY THAT -- IT'S GREAT THAT I WAS INVOLVED MEDICALLY BECAUSE THAT GAVE ME A LOT OF CONFIDENCE TO DO. WHATEVER I NEED TO DO AS A CAREGIVER BOTH THEN AND YOU KNOW -- DOWN THE ROAD [INAUDIBLE] A SO. I WAS ABLE TO DO MY JOB. ARE WHICH IS VERY FORTUNATE FROM WHAT I SEE. A UNITED PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT HAS -- THE NO THEY HAVE TO BE A AND A NINE TO FIVE JOB BEING A SALES PERSON GIVES YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE. LEEWAY AS TO WHICH YOU WANT TO DO AND I ENDED UP WORKING FOR A LOT OF GREAT PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTOOD MY SITUATION AND WHERE WE'RE WILLING TO WORK WITH ME. A I BECAME A REGIONAL MANAGER COVERED THE WHOLE NORTHEAST AND I WAS ABLE TO DO THAT. FOR FOR QUITE AWHILE [INAUDIBLE] BUT OF IN. TWO THOUSAND ONE YOU KNOW EVERYTHING CHANGED -- WE LOST OUR YOUNGEST CHILD OR OR OR SIGNED. OF BOBBY WHO WAS SEVENTEEN AT THE TIME IN A CAR ACCIDENT BASED ON YOUR BAD WEATHER. SO THAT JUST THREW EVERYTHING OUT OF WHACK AND ON WE ARE. WHAT HAPPENED FROM THAT POINT IS ON MY DAUGHTER? DROPPED OUT OF COLLEGE -- AND WHEN SHE DID RETURN SHIA TO SCHOOL SHE ENDED UP COMING OUT TO THE WEST COAST. AND I WENT TO THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN FRANCISCO AND GATS HOW WE ENDED UP COMING OUT HERE AS WELL ON IN TWO THOUSAND ONE I WAS NO LONGER ABLE TO KEEP UP THE TRAVEL INVOLVED WITH BEING A MANAGER. SO PA I TOOK ANOTHER JOB AT AGE FIFTY FIVE I WAS FORTUNATELY ABLE TO A YOU CHANGE OR NOT MY CAREER I STILL STATE MEDICAL. BY DOG. I DID THAT FOR YEAR AND THEN WE I WAS ABLE TO GET A TERRITORY OUT HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO WE COULD FOLLOW OR DAUGHTER OUT HERE WHO DID. AFTER SHE GRADUATES -- GET MARRIED AND SUBSEQUENTLY SAID WE'VE WE HAVE TWO GRANDDAUGHTERS [INAUDIBLE] ARM [INAUDIBLE] THE WHAT'S WE GOT OUT HERE WE IMMEDIATELY BECAME INVOLVED IN THE AND THE MS SOCIETY. AND OUR I EVEN. DEVELOPED A OUR CAREGIVER SUPPORT GROUP WHICH LASTED ABOUT THREE YEARS YOU CAN'T KEEP CAREGIVERS COMING. UP TO TWO MEETINGS BECAUSE THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THE TIME. TO DID THAT AS LONG AS AS POSSIBLE. AND THEN WE WE KIND OF MADE A LITTLE MISTAKE LEAH [INAUDIBLE] WANTED. TO DO THE BEST BY BY EVERYONE AND I GET SOME REAL ESTATE SO WE BOUGHT A HOUSE TOGETHER ARE UNFORTUNATELY. AT THAT POINT A TIME ALICE. ACTUALLY STARTED GETTING WHERE SHE STARRED LOSING THE YOU USE OF HER LEFT HAND SO AT THAT POINT SHE COULD NO LONGER TRANSFER ON THE ROAD. SO WE WE HAD TO BRING IT HERE BRINGING CAREGIVERS AND OF WHICH WHICH I DID AND I WAS STILL ABLE TO KEEP WORKING BY BY DOING THAT THAT. IT WAS NOT A GOOD SITUATION FOR FOR OUR TOTAL FAMILY DYNAMICS SO WE HAD. TO OUR BREAK UP OUR FAMILY SITUATION AND WE MOVED BACK GOT INTO APARTMENTS SITUATION WHERE.

OF MY SHRINK SIDE I WAS A FORMER ATHLETE IN MARINE I'D BEEN ABLE TO KEEP UP WITH EVERYTHING I DON'T GET DEPRESSED [INAUDIBLE] BUT I COULD SURE USE SOME HELP RIGHT NOW BECKWITH RESPITE BOTTLED UP BY BOTHER HARM. ABA IN THE INTEREST OF TIME IF WE CAN DO ABOUT THAT UP HERE BUT THANK YOU FOR TELLING US ABOUT YOUR JOURNEY. BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE JOURNEY IS REALLY A CALL. UNIQUE THAT COMMON IN THAT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT IT'S INVESTING YOU KNOW. SITUATIONS CHANGED AND INVALUABLE THE CAREGIVER WITHOUT EVER ASKING FOR IT OR YOU A DOES NOT RING IS NEVER THE SENATE YEAH. BUT BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH BOB FOR SHARING ARM AND IT BEGIN ABOVE THE MOVE FORWARD MATT OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE OF QUESTIONS COMMENTS LATER. ABA SUSAN DEMERITS THAT ACCOMPANIES THE POLICY DIRECTOR OF THE ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION AGREE PARTNER OF THIS LEGISLATION [INAUDIBLE] THANK. GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE AND THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY -- I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN AND THE COMMITTEE. FOR AND I WANT TO THANK SANDERS. WHO CREATED WHO ALLOWED US TO WORK ON THIS REPORT AND FOR EVERYONE WHO DID THE TREMENDOUS STAFF WORK TO PRODUCE IT TODAY? I'M ON DEADLINE JULY TWENTY EIGHTEEN HERE WE ARE -- BACK IN -- TWENTY ELEVEN CALIFORNIA DID A SIMILAR PROCESS TO DEVELOP AND ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE STATE PLAN AND THERE WERE SIX GOAL AREAS IN THAT PLAN ONE OF THEM WAS. ACKNOWLEDGE THE INFORMAL ROLE OF THE FAMILY CARE GIVER AND TODAY WE'RE DOING THAT WERE PUBLICLY ACKNOWLEDGING IT TOOK SEVEN YEARS BUT WE'RE DOING IT TODAY. SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. I'M IN DONNA'S SLIDES WERE AND I ALSO WANTED TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE IN THE ROOM KNOWS THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA DID INTRODUCE -- ATTACKS A CAREGIVER TAX CREDIT BILL LAST YEAR -- AND WAS A LEADER ON ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT'S CONTAINED IN THE REPORT AND WE WERE PLEASED TO WORK WITH THE MS SOCIETY ON THAT THAT LEGISLATION -- AND DONNA'S OVERVIEW YOU SAW THAT ONE IN FOUR CALIFORNIA CARE GIVERS ARE PROVIDING CARE TO SOMEONE LIVING WITH DEMENTIA -- IN IN OUR STATE TODAY THAT THAT MEANS ONE POINT SIX MILLION INDIVIDUALS ARE CAREGIVERS -- IN THIS SLIDE HERE ON THIS IS ALFORD IN SAN DIEGO. WHO PROVIDED PARITY Y. THEIR STORIES TYPICAL SHE HAD TO LEAVE HER HIGH SCHOOL PILE GT JOB? EARTH. AND PANTER HIS RARE EARLY EIGHTEEN DURING HIS WATCH SO TWO CAREERS -- WERE CUT SHORT WHICH IN INCLUDED THERE -- MONTHLY INCOME AS WELL AS I'M FOR GOING A LOT OF THEIR RETIREMENT SAVINGS [INAUDIBLE] BANKS. TODAY WE HAVE SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS LIVING WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT NUMBER'S GOING TO CLIMB. IN THE TIME THAT OUR NEWEST ASSEMBLY MEMBER WILL BE IN OFFICE WE HOPE. BOTH OF THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS HERE TODAY. ON IN THIS SLIDE YOU HAVE -- BOB LYNCH SIDE HIS PROVIDING CARE TO HIS WIFE PAM. ON SHE IS LIVING WITH YOUNGER ONSET ALZHEIMER'S AND SHE HAD TO CUT SHORT HER CAREER AS AN EXECUTIVE WITH INTEL. IN SAN JOSE AND IS NOW PARTICIPATING IN RESEARCH. I KNOW HER BEEN WOULD BE -- SUFFERING IMPRESSED TEACH THEM AS HE IS KEEPING CAREER. A BOAT DURING HIS WHAT. AND WE HEARD FROM EDEA -- ABOUT THE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTS ON AND FROM THE CDC CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL DATA WE DID CONDUCT -- CAREGIVER -- BURDEN DATA ON CALIFORNIA AND THIS IS WHAT WE CONCLUDED NOT SURPRISING. ON THE MAJORITY ARE WOMEN -- SURPRISINGLY THE MAJORITY DO HAVE A COLLEGE DEGREE. ON BUT AS WE'RE HEARING MORE AND MORE THAT MOST ARE UNDER AGE. SIXTY FOUR AND THE VAST MAJORITY ARE IN. AND IN THE CASE OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND WE HEARD THIS FROM YOU TOO ON CAREGIVERS ARE PROVIDING VERY INTIMATE CARE NOT SUPERFICIAL CARE SUCH AS MAKING LUNCH ON THEIR VERY INTIMATELY INVOLVED IN CAREGIVING. AND THIS IS LIVE BASS YOU JUST GRADUATED WITH A MASTER'S IN PUBLIC HEALTH. FROM SAN BASS BEAT UNIVERSITY. AND SHE TOOK TIME OFF BETWEEN HER PROGRESS GRADUATE SCHOOL TRIED TO HER GRAND DAUGHTER SO SHE WOULD BE A MILLENNIAL CAREGIVER. AND THEY'RE ARMED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MILLENNIAL CAREGIVERS IN OUR STATE. SO NOW IN TERMS OF THE REPORT WE AGREE A 100% WITH EVERY RECOMMENDATION SO WE COULD END THERE BUT THERE ARE FEW -- I WON THE FLAG IF YOU POLICY CHANGES THAT. ON THE ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION IN PARTICULAR SUPPORTS -- THIS THAT THIS. NAM ABOUT. MORE ER VISITS THAN THERE ARE PEOPLE WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE SHOULD CONCERN ALL OF US -- THAT IS NOT THE RIGHT PLACE. I'M TO RECEIVE CARE IT'S VERY COSTLY TO MEDICARE AND MEDICAID BUT IT'S OFTEN OUT OF EXASPERATION FOR A FAMILY CAREGIVER -- WHO DOESN'T KNOW WHERE TO TURN -- DURING THE NIGHT ON THE WEEKENDS -- AND WE WE THINK IN THE REPORT ON THE FOCUS ON CARE TRANSITIONS IS VERY IMPORTANT THIS IS OFTEN WHERE THIS OCCURS -- BETWEEN LEVELS OF CARE THAT SOMEBODY. ON PERHAPS IS AN ASSISTED LIVING AND THEN AN AMBULANCE IS CALLED AND THEY GO TO THE HOSPITAL WHERE THEY'RE AT HOME AND THEY GO TO THE HOSPITAL -- CAREGIVER TRAINING AND EDUCATION WHEN THE CAREGIVER IS INFORMED WHATEVER THE CONDITION IS WHATEVER THE DURATION OF THE CARE GIVING WITH -- CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE. AND HEALTH INFORMATION ON THAT THEY CAN UNDERSTAND WHETHER IT'S PAMPHLETS ONLINE OR IN PERSON TRAINING. ON THIS REALLY HELPS REDUCE ON HOSPITALIZATIONS I'M AND THEN WAIT WE FULLY SUPPORT THE STANDARDIZE CARE GIVER ASSESSMENT RECOMMENDATION BECAUSE WORKING STATEWIDE WE SEE PEOPLE DEPENDING ON WHICH COUNTY THERE AND THEY'RE ASK DIFFERENT QUESTIONS WHEN THEY WHEN THEIR LOVED ONE PROGRESSES. TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE THEY START OVER WITH THE WHOLE NOTHER ASSESSMENT AND MOST OFTEN CARE GIVERS AREN'T ASSESSED AT ALL. OBSERVE OTHER POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS WE WE STRONGLY SUPPORT AND ON THE CARE TRANSITIONS PEAS AND MANY OF YOU KNOW. OMINOUS OUR EXPERIENCE WITH THE ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION THAT -- YOU KNOW SOMEONE MAY NOT BE A CAREGIVER. ALL SOMEONE'S HOSPITALIZED AND SOMEBODY ON FROM OUT OF THE AREA AN ADULT CHILD BECOMES A CAREGIVER OVERNIGHTS -- SO CARE. CARE TRANSITIONS -- REQUIRE VERY SPECIAL FOCUSED ATTENTION. AND IN TERMS OF BUDGET CHANGES ARM THIS IS PAUL IN REDDING CALIFORNIA AND WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT -- THE ODD KNOWS THAT CAN BRING EXTENDS TO LIKE IT'S COULD ENTITIES TO THE NEP WILL PROVIDE CARE TO A LOVED ONE ASSISTED LIVING IN SINGLE VISIT DAILY. AND ARE MISSING MANAGED CARE EVEN AND A LICENSE OR A HOSPITAL SETTING. I'M SO WERE VERY STRONG STRONG ON PROPONENTS OF INCREASING THE NUMBER OF HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED. OPTIONS AVAILABLE FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH A VARIETY OF CONDITIONS AS WELL AS FOR CAREGIVERS. AND EXPANDING RESPITE CARE OPTIONS CERTAINLY THE CAREGIVER RESOURCE CENTERS WOULD BE. ON TOP OF MIND THERE ARE OTHER RESTED OPTIONS THAT WE'D LIKE TO SEE EXPANDED AS IN ADDITION TO THE PROM. FULLY FUNDING ON THE CAREGIVER RESOURCE CENTERS AND STRENGTHENING LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE ONE OF THE THE HARDEST CALLS THAT WE TAKE ON OUR HELPLINE IS WHEN. SOMEONE SAYS AND WE HEAR THIS. DOZENS OF TIMES A DAY. BUT WAIT I THOUGHT MEDICARE COVERED THAT AND WE HAVE TO EDUCATE SOMEBODY IN CRISIS ABOUT THE LIMITATIONS OF MEDICARE. AND QUALIFYING FOR MEDI CAL IF THAT'S EVEN AN OPTION -- FOR THEM SO THOSE WOULD BE ARE. THOUGH THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION WITH UNDERSCORE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SUSAN. UP NEXT AT JUNIOR CASTING DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA WORK AND FAMILY COALITION. THANK YOU I'M I'M REALLY EXCITED AND HAPPY TO BE HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE TASK FORCE. I WAS SO I AM -- I WORK WITH A STATEWIDE CALIFORNIA WORK AND FAMILY COALITION. AND THE DIRECTOR THERE'S A MEMBERS AND STAFF HERE GOING TODAY. AND WE ARE KIND OF COLLECTIVE VISION IS A WORLD WHERE AND THE COUNTRY IN THE STATE WHERE ALL PEOPLE HAVE THE TIME RESOURCES AND SUPPORT SYSTEMS. TO CARE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES AND MEANINGFUL LIVES AND I FEEL LIKE THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THIS REALLY COINCIDE WITH THAT BECAUSE WE RECENTLY -- INDUCTED ON OF ANTENNAS ON OUR STERN COMMITTEE WE'VE REALLY -- WANTING TO HAVE PUT SOME MORE FOCUS IN OUR WORK WHICH IS ON A WORKPLACE SUPPORT. FOR WORKERS WHO NEED TO YOU KNOW BALANCE THEIR WORK AND THEIR FAMILY LIFE -- AND WE REALLY WANT TO FOCUS IN ON CARE GIVERS BECAUSE THERE'S JUST NOT. ENOUGH OF THEIR ON BOTH KNOWLEDGE YOU MIGHT CARE GIVERS REALLY NEED WHICH I THINK THIS TASK FORCE HAS LAID OUT SOME REALLY GREAT. RECOMMENDATIONS AND WE ARE ALSO DOING A STUDY FOCUSING IN ON PAID FAMILY LEAVE AND HOW THAT WORKS OR DOESN'T WORK. FOR OUR CAREGIVERS AND WHAT ELSE PEOPLE NEED BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT'S BAILEY'S SOMETIMES IT'S LIKE. YOU KNOW A PREDICTABLE SCHEDULE ARE THINGS YOU KNOW THAT HOW PEOPLE BALANCE THEIR LIFE. I'M SO YOU KNOWS PEOPLE KNOW THAT CARE GIVING IS REALLY EXPENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING AND EXHAUSTING. IN I'M WORKING WITH HUMAN IMPACT PARTNERS ON THE STUDY FOCUSED ON CARE GIVERS AND WHY THEY'RE NOT TAKING PAID LEAVE -- ONE OF THE THINGS I LEARNED RIGHT AWAY EVEN IN JUST DURING THE OUTREACH IS HOW IT INCREDIBLY EXHAUSTED. BOB PEOPLE ARE AND I'VE BEEN HEARING STORIES WHERE AT THE BEGINNING OF A CARE GIVER JOURNEY IS ALSO THE BEGINNING OF OFTEN A SPIRALING INTO POVERTY THEY CAN REALLY TURN INTO LONG TERM FINANCIAL INSECURITY. OF I WAS ON A PANEL EARLIER THIS -- BEN BARTLETT AND HE TOLD HIS STORY OF HIS MOTHER LOSING A JOB BECAUSE OF BECOMING A CARE GIVER. AND HOW HE REMEMBERS THAT AS JUST THAT EVERYTHING CHANGED FOR HIS FAMILY -- INCLUDING EVEN HOMELESS SAYS LIVING WITH DIFFERENT FAMILY MEMBERS THIS IS NOT EVEN AN UNUSUAL STORY ESPECIALLY IN CALIFORNIA WHERE. EVERYBODY -- IS FACING SUCH A HOUSING EVICTION CRISIS IN OTHERS YOU NAME IT AND THAT'S WHY I LOVE I'M DOING COALITION WORK BECAUSE WE'RE VERY FOCUSED IN ON WORKPLACE POLICIES. BUT WE ARE PRETTY DIVERSE IN THE SENSE OF LGBTQ NEW EMIGRANTS ARMED THEM YOU KNOW ANTI DOMESTIC VIOLENCE GROUPS. SO WE ARE A LOT OF GROUPS THAT DON'T JUST FOCUS ON THIS BUT REALLY BORING HOW DOES THIS AFFECT OUR COMMUNITY BECAUSE EVERYBODY. IS AFFECTED BY CARE GIVING AND IT'S YOU KNOW SUCH A KEY. ISSUE I'M SO JUST AS A QUICK QUICK REFRESHER ON PAID LEAVE WHICH IS. THE A LOT OF PROGRESS TOGETHER IN THE COALITION WE FOUND WAS VERY HISTORICALLY PASSED PAID LEAVE IN. TWO THOUSAND TWO AND A LOT OF THE GROUPS WHERE CHILDCARE I THINK I MET -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER ERICA I'M LIKE A DOVE AT THAT TIME. A LONG TIME AGO. IT WAS THAT YOU KNOW REALLY GREAT GROUP CAME TOGETHER WE PASS IT WAS HISTORIC PEOPLE USED TO SAY I MEMBER ON WEST WING SOME EPISODES SOMEBODY BECAUSE A HUG THEM WILL HAVE PAID FAMILY LEAVE. LIKE THAT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN EVER IN THE COUNTRY AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING WE JUST HAD A SENATE HEARING TALKING ABOUT DOING AND WE HOPE THE RIGHT WAY NOT EATING INTO SOCIAL SECURITY. THE WE'RE LOOKING AT HAVING AND THAT'S A LINE THAT SEEMS IMMINENT THAT AT SOME POINT SOON AS WE WELL. ARM IN MEANWHILE YOU KNOW SEVEN DIFFERENT STATES HAVE IT SO HE LEAVING CALIFORNIA THAT WAS JUST A BENEFIT IT IS NOT A RIGHT THAT WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT IT PROVIDES A WAGE REPLACEMENT. WHEN YOU GO OUT SO WHAT DONNA TOUCHED ON EARLIER IN THAT 40% OF PEOPLE CAN BE LEFT OUT THAT MEANS YOU CAN LITERALLY PAY INTO THIS? STI YOU COVERED BY PAID LEAVE FOR EITHER CARE GIVING OR BONDING WITH A NEW CHILD BUT NOT BE COVERED BY ONE OF THE LAWS THAT PROTECT YOUR JOB. THIS IS BEEN LIKE WE HAVE INTRODUCED AND RELIGIOUS ARENA TRUTH LEGISLATION THAT WOULD EXTEND OUR PROTECTION TO PARENTS AND CAREGIVERS OR WE SPLIT THEM UP OR WE PUT THEM TOGETHER AGAIN IN A JUST TRYING IT. ALL DIFFERENT WAYS THAT HAS HAD A HUGE AMOUNT OF JUST LAST YEAR ACTUALLY PATH. FOR THE FIRST TIME I'M MORE JOB PROTECTION FOR PARENT NEW PARENTS WE REALLY OF NO FROM ALL THE STUDIES THAT CAME OUT. I SIX YEARS SEVEN YEARS AFTER PAVE THE PAST WE LEARNED. FROM RUTH MILKMAN AND EILEEN APPLEBAUM I'M A STUDY ON PAY LEAVING CALIFORNIA HOW IMMENSE THE BENEFITS WERE. LONGER BREASTFEEDING -- MORE DADS TAKING BONDING TIME OF ECONOMIC SECURITY FOR THE PEOPLE WHO TOOK IT BUT THAT SAME STUDIES SHOWED US THAT IT DOES NOT WORK FOR EVERYBODY EQUALLY. AND THAT'S OUR PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME NEW IMMIGRANT LOS ANGELES COUNTY FOR SOME REASON SUPER LOW AWARENESS. ALL WE DID A A FIELD POLL THAT SHOWED 36% AND EVEN LOWER AMONG THE GROUPS I JUST MENTIONED. SO THEY'RE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT STUDIES THAT RANGE BETWEEN THIRTY SIX OR 46% BUT THAT'S PRETTY LOW FOR ABOUT YOU KNOWS A FUNDS. THE MOST OF US PAN TO WHO SO ONE OF OUR FIRST HOUSE IN THE COALITION WAS. TO GET ON SOME FUNDING IN YOU KNOW WITH EASY DO SOME. EDUCATION AND OUTREACH WE THINK THAT HOUSE THAT THAT'S BEEN A REALLY GREAT START BUT IT HAS TO GO FURTHER. INTO SOME OF THE I'M IN A KIND OF MORE COMMUNITY OUTREACH THE OTHER ISSUE IS A FEAR OF RETALIATION. LOSING YOUR JOB WE REALLY NEED TO EXTEND JOB PROTECTION -- TO CAREGIVERS WHEN THEY TAKE TIME OFF BECAUSE HEAPING YOUR JOB -- FOR WORKING CAREGIVERS IS THAT HE LOSING EVERYTHING OUT SO WE'RE VERY MUCH WITH THE RECOMMENDATION OF ALL OF THE SUPPORT THAT WOULD MAKE PAINFULLY WORK BETTER -- WE'VE DONE SOME THINGS LIKE EXTEND THE WAGE REPLACEMENT WE WANT TO SEE IF THAT'S WORKING IS THAT ENOUGH IS THE NEED TO BE MORE. A COUPLE OF CITIES HAVE IT MADE FULLY PAID PAID LEAVE WE'RE HOPING BERKELEY EVEN IF IT'S JUST AN EXAMPLE. WILL DO THIS FOR CAREGIVERS TO SO WE CAN SEE HOW DOES THAT HELP WHEN PEOPLE CAN GET THEIR FULL PAY. SOME. SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT -- ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS IN TERMS OF OUR KIND OF RECOMMENDATIONS WITH WHERE TO GO NEXT ARE. WORKING ON THOSE -- WORKING WITH US AND THE EDT WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE. BEING MORE CONNECTED TO THE TASK FORCE IN SOME WAY -- SO THAT THESE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE HEARD BY THE THE THE BECAUSE THEY CAN DO A LOT -- IN TERMS OF HELPING US GET THIS OUT TO THE COMMUNITY -- TOGETHER EDUCATE PEOPLE ON THEIR RIGHTS -- WE ALSO DO TRAININGS -- OF CAREGIVERS AND PARENTS ON THE RIGHTS OF THE OTHER THING TOO IS THAT HE LEAVES HAVING A REALLY BIG MOMENT. AND WE NEED TO REALLY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT IT'S IN THE PRESS. RUBIO IS INTRODUCING A BILL BUT WE ABSOLUTELY WANT TO TAKE THIS MOMENT AND STAND FOR THE STRONGEST BEST MOST INCLUSIVE. HAY LEAVE THAT WE CAN AND NOT IT WOULD ONLY BENEFIT PARENTS ABOUT THAT PARENTS ARE NEEDED. TO AND NOT BENEFIT THEM VERY WELL THINK THE GROOVY A BILL THAT WOULD ALSO CUTTING INTO SOCIAL SECURITY WHICH IS FOUNDATIONAL. TO EVERYTHING. SO WE ABSOLUTELY -- I INVITE EVERYBODY TO STAND WITH US BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH WE'RE CALIFORNIA AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PASS STRONGER LAWS WE ARE GONNA REALLY NEED TO STAND WITH OUR SISTER COALITIONS AROUND THE COUNTRY. A TAKING THAT TIME BECAUSE THERE THE CAREGIVER ANYBODY WHO'S BEEN IN A WORKING COMMITTEE KNOWS THERE'S THAT ONE PERSON THAT DOES ALL THE WORK. CARE GIVERS LIKE MY CO WORKERS TALKING THINKING YOU KNOW HOW THAT I'M SITUATION WHERE THERE THE ONE EVEN AND I'M DOING A LITTLE HELPING WITH THE RESEARCH WE DID RECENTLY I HEARD THAT AGAIN AND AGAIN. I'M THE ONE PERSON BUT I'VE GOT SIBLINGS ABOUT THIS ABOUT THAT. IF WE'RE LOOKING AT PAID LEAVE THE WAY DAD STARTED TAKING LEAVE MORE. IT'S NOT THAT I I THINK IT DOES NEED TO BE A CHOICE BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE NEED TO CREATE THAT CULTURE WHERE IT SPREADING FURTHER. AND IF YOU ARE A FAMILY MEMBER EVEN FAR AWAY YOU TAKE CAN TAKE SOMETIME. YOU CAN GIVE THE PART OF THE RESPITE FOR THAT PERSON THAT IS EXHAUSTED IN DEALING WITH HEALTH ISSUES OF THEIR OWN. SO THOSE ARE OUR INNER CONDITIONS AND I REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO THEM CONTINUING TO COLLABORATE HOPEFULLY. THEY KILL YOU THANK YOU. I'M HOOKED. UP NEXT WITH AMANDA STEELE DEPUTY PAUSED POLICY DIRECTOR SEIU LOCAL. TWENTY FIFTEEN THANK YOU AND I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER. FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY -- THIS TASK FORCES. FOR ME I'M WORKING AT A YOU KNOW. WE REPRESENT OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND I JUST US WORKERS WHICH IS OUR OWN IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA SO. I'M REALLY GRATEFUL THAT THIS WORK IS BEING DONE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND I'M EXCITED TO BE HERE. UNTO YOU GO TO THE CAN. I'M I APOLOGIZE FOR ALL THE NUMBERS BUT I AM A RESEARCHER HURT SOMEHOW I I LIKE NUMBERS -- BUT I'LL TRY AND MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT MORE INTERESTING SO I JUST WANTED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ON THE HOME CARE LANDSCAPE HEARING PORN YOU. WERE HEARING A LOT ABOUT ON THE ON THE FAMILY. RIVER IN THE STATE. AND THEY ALSO A WHOLE OTHER ON SITE. PAID THEM CARE WORKERS ON YOU KNOW WE HAVE OUR PRIVATE AGENCY WHO ARE WERE BIRDS ARE. WE DOING HOME HEALTH WORKED. ON YOU WE HAVE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SEVEN THOUSAND OF THOSE HERBS HEARING CALIFORNIA AND THOSE ARE MOSTLY. ON PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE MEANS TO A OUT POCKET FOR A HOME BECOMING THEIR HOME AND TAKE CARE OF SERVICES PROGRAM WHICH IS FUNDED THROUGH MEDI CAL HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THOSE ARE THE WORKERS THAT WE REPRESENT ON THERE'S OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND OF THOSE WORKERS HEARING* CARRIED. FOR ABOUT OFTEN MEANS THERE IS AN ABSENCE OF THE BILL FACILITY HUGE WORKFORCE. AND I'LL JUST KIND OF TOUCH ON SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN SAID. IN THAT YOU KNOW THIS WORKFORCE IS LARGELY WOMEN MINORITIES LOW WAGE WORKERS SO I'M IT'S THE POPULATION AND DIET AND REALLY IT IS IT'S A VERY UNIQUE POPULATION AND I'M IN ITS REFLECTIVE ALSO OF YOU KNOW THAT THE UNPAID. AT FAMILY CAREGIVERS THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER. SO I AGES SIZE HAS GROWN A LOT AT HOME IT IT'S GROWN I'M FROM ABOUT CARING FOR FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE TO OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND IN THE PAST TEN YEARS. WE EXPECTED TO KEEP GROWTH IN OUR PEOPLE ARE ADRIN OF COURSE AND PEOPLE NEED THE SURPLUS FUND. ON THIS IS A PROGRAM SERVING PEOPLE AND I AM. OUR LOW INCOME THERE AND MEDI CAL ON MANY OF THEM ARE ALSO FAMILY CAREGIVERS. AND THERE IS ABOUT AND THERE'S OVER ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS FROM FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDING THAT ONE INTO LARGE SAYS PROGRAM I'M WHICH OBVIOUSLY IS A TON OF MONEY -- BUT THIS PROGRAM IS STILL IT STILL FACES CHALLENGES ALL THE TIME BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS GROWING AND THE NEEDS ARE JUST GONNA CONTINUE. TO SO I JUST WANTED. TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ON THE HOME CARE CRISIS THAT WERE KIND OF FACING RIGHT NOW AND PEOPLE REALLY NEED HOME CARE. AND AND AND I THINK THAT THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF A PUSH TO MOVE AWAY FROM INSTITUTIONAL CARE AND TWO MORE HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES SO. YOU KNOW WE ALL KNOW THAT THE POPULATION OF PEOPLE OVER SIXTY FIVE IS IS GROWING AT A REALLY RAPID RATE SO. THERE'S EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT NINE MILLION I'M PEOPLE OVER SIXTY FIVE BENEATH ME SO WILL ARE THE PEOPLE AMERICA NEEDS SOME TYPE OF LONG TERM CARE. SO ON MEAN IF THE HOME CARE INDUSTRY WORD EXPANDED OVER ALL THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE SOME SORT OF CARE LIMITATION FOR THOSE REALLY THE PEOPLE THAT. I'M WOULD NEED SOME TYPE OF HELP ON THIS IN THEIR HOME. WE NEED AT LEAST SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITS AND AS MUCH AS THREE MEN AND ADDITIONAL HOME CARE WORKERS DINNERS BY TWELVE THIRTY TO MEET THAT THAT DEMAND. AND AND RIGHT NOW THE THE INDUSTRY IS JUST NOT ATTRACTING WORKERS BECAUSE THE WAGES AND THE BENEFITS THAT'S A VERY HARD JOB IT'S A VERY DEMANDING JOB. ON YOU KNOW AS WAS TALK ABOUT BY OTHER ON PEOPLE ON THESE PANELS THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE LEAVING THEIR FULL TIME JOB ARE THERE OTHER LUCRATIVE ABOUT WORK TO TAKE CARE SOMEONE ELSE AND THEN IT PUTS THEM AND YOU KNOW ABOUT FINANCIAL SUCH. THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES THAT COME COME ALONG WITH TAKING ON THIS ROLE. SO ON THIS -- WASN'T SO. DOES THIS STATUS FROM TWENTY FIFTEEN SO ON ITS LITTLE BIT OUTDATED BUT THIS IS JUST HIGHLIGHTING THE THE LOW WAGES THAT HOME CARE WORKERS. ARE FACING COMPARED TO OTHER ON EMPLOYEES OPPORTUNITIES AND A LOT OF HOME CARE WORKERS ARE ARE THAN THAT SO. EITHER LIVING AND BLOWING THEM HOUSEHOLDERS RECEIVING PUBLIC ASSISTANCE THAT SOUTH NOT ONLY A BOUTIQUE AIRSOFT GUN. THAT IS ON MEDI CAL OR AND IS RELYING ON THESE PROGRAMS BUT AS A HOME CARE WORKER MANY OF THEM ARE ALSO RELYING ON THOSE ON PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS TO GET BY. SO THOSE IDEA THE NEXT SLIDE. SO YOUR VISITORS GOING INTO MORE OF THE ODD ON IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT 22% OF HOME CARE WORKERS ARE RELYING ON FOOD STAMPS. AND 22% ARE LIVING OUT OUR BELOW THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. SO THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM AND AND YOU KNOW A LOT OF HOME CARE WORKERS ARE ARE AT MINIMUM WAGE -- A LOT OF THEM DON'T RECEIVE HEALTH INSURANCE. AND ON IT YOU KNOW IT'S DIFFICULT AND IT'S IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT HOME PROGRAM AND A GUN YOU KNOW WE AS A UNION WE WE BARGAIN AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND THERE'S FIFTY SIX COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO EACH COUNTY IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM ANOTHER ON AND HOW WILLING. THEY ARE TO INVEST IN I JUST US AND HOME CARE WORK ARMS SO YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO REALLY GET THIS WORKFORCE TO BE RECOGNIZES A PROFESSIONAL REALLY VALUED. AND GROUP OF WORKERS THINK THERE'S THIS PERCEPTION THAT'S MAYBE STARTING TO CHANGE NOW THAT. HOME CARE WORKERS ARE JUST ALMOST LIKE A HOUSE KEEPER DOING HOME HOMEMAKING WORK AND THAT'S JUST NOT TRUE ON THEIR DOING SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT THEY'RE KEEPING PEOPLE SAFE IN THEIR HOMES I'M A LOT OF THEM ARE DOING MEDICAL TASK SO. I THINK WE HAVE TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE THIS PROFESSION IS REALLY RECOGNIZED FOR WHAT IT IS AND THE VALUE THAT IT BRINGS TO OUR SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITY. SO JUST GOING INTO THAT -- THERE'S SOME STATS THAT SAY AND I JUST US THE ANNUAL TURNOVER IS AS HIGH AS 33% WHICH MEANS THAT. ABOUT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND CONSUMERS ARE OR RECIPIENTS THAT ARE RECEIVING CARE HAVE TO FIND A NEW PROVIDER. EVERY YEAR. AND AS AN OF THE CALL. I'M HURDLE OF TURNOVER BIRD A LONG TERM CARE WORKER IS ABOUT. TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOCTORS DEMAND AND WHAT THE THERE AND NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN CARE THAT THE A HUGE CALL [INAUDIBLE] BILLIARDS RE WITH ALL OF THOSE ON HERE IS [INAUDIBLE] EMOTIONAL [INAUDIBLE] WORK I'M IT'S TAKING THEM YOU KNOW AWAY FOR MORE LUCRATIVE CAREERS IT'S ALSO HARD TO ATTRACT PEOPLE ESPECIALLY PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT FAMILY CAREGIVERS ON THERE'S A HIGH NEED. FOR ON PEOPLE TO TAKE CARE OF OTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY AYE YOUR FAMILY SO IT'S REALLY HARD TO GET PEOPLE INTO THOSE ROLES. AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE OR AGAIN THAT WE'RE CREATING THOSE QUALITY JOBS THAT ARE MOSTLY FOR WOMEN PEOPLE OF COLOR OF FOREIGN BORN WORKERS. AND THEN AGAIN -- IT ALL IT ALL GOES BACK TO MAKING IT A STABLE PROFESSION THAT'S RECOGNIZED ON RAISING THE WAGES AND PROVIDING GOOD BENEFITS OFFER HOME CARE WORKERS I AM. GRANTED IN INDUSTRY SHORTAGE IS BY. HAVING ENHANCED ANY CAREER LOOK BETTER THOUGH. AND APPARENTLY IT'S NO. NO SIR BIG HERE PAN FOR I'M HOME WORK BUT I'M REALLY ARE SENATE CREATING OR A TRAIN OPERATES NEEDS FOR HOME CARE WORKERS. IN SOME MENTIONED HAVING THEM BE MORE PART OF INTEGRATED CARE TEAM AND BE MORE INVOLVED WITH YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THEIR CONSUMERS CARE AND TALKING TO THE DOCTORS AND NO WHEN IS THOSE ARE ALL IMPORTANT. IS THAT THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN IN THE HOME TOGETHER THE WRAP UP ASSURE YOU I'M THAT OUR THAT I I AM THAT'S ACTUALLY MY LAST SLIDE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH AMANDA. OF THEM AND THEN WE'LL MOVE ON TO CRISTINA BASS HAMILTON LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR. UNITED DOMESTIC WORKERS OF AMERICA ASK YOU LOCAL THREE NINE THIRTY I END UP BEFORE YOU BEGIN TO SEE THAT. ALSO EXTEND THE AB EXTEND OUR THANKS TO YOUR EXACT DIRECTOR DOUG MORRIS SERVED ON THE TASK FORCES I'LL BE REALLY APPRECIATE THANK YOU AT YES -- ACTUALLY HE IS SORRY HE CAN BE HERE TODAY WE HAVE OUR INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION IN BOSTON. SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER COME LONGER. A DOVE IF I HAVE ANY AYE. WANT TO ECHO EVERYTHING EVERYONE SAID DOESN'T LIKE THE EASIEST PAMELA BEYOND HERE RIGHT YEAH WHO. I'M ACTUALLY WHAT I WILL SAY IS THIS. I THINK WHAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING IS THE CRISIS OF BIRD BEING PARDON THE PUN BECAUSE I'M. THANK YOU VERY FELLOW RIGHT NOW BURBANK LITERALLY IN A SYSTEM I DON'T [INAUDIBLE] CHAOS AND WHEN A WHAT YOU WOULD CALL IN NON [INAUDIBLE] STATUS OF SYSTEMS RIGHT BESTSELLERS. LITERALLY NO PRODUCT OF BRAIN LACK OF VALUE OF THIS TYPE OF LABOR HISTORICALLY [INAUDIBLE] AND COMING OUT OF YOU KNOW NINES OF TIME IN WHICH THIS TYPE OF LABOR WAS DONE I'M PAID UNRECOGNIZED AT HOME. AND I WAS SIMPLY NOT A TOPIC OF PUBLIC DISCUSSION AND WAS SIMPLY A SOMETHING THAT FAMILY MEMBERS ALL USUALLY FEMALE DID AND PART OF THEIR EXPECTATION OF SOCIETAL ROLES. AND SO WE NOW LIVE IN A DIFFERENT WORLD WHERE PEOPLE ARE LIVING LONGER AND FOLKS DELUDE WORKING OUTSIDE THE HOME. AND WE HAVE A CRISIS BECAUSE HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THAT HOW DO YOU HAVE A SYSTEM. WHERE NON CURRENTLY EXISTS EXCEPT FOR THIS INFORMAL -- SYSTEM OR NON SYSTEM. SO. OUT OF CHAOS WE NEED TO BIRTH SOMETHING NEW AND WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING NEW BECAUSE REVENUE GOVERNOR. AND THAT NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE A GOVERNOR WE CONSTELLATION OF OF FACTORS WE'VE GOT THE THREAT OF LOSING MEDICAID FUNDING WHICH IS JUST A QUESTION OF TIME AND ALL OF THIS IS FUNDED BY MEDICAID WE'VE GOT. THE CRISIS WITHIN IHS US ITSELF WHICH IS THAT THEY COUNTIES THE SHARING OF COSTS OF I JUST AS IF YOU KNOW ANYONE WHO WORKS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. THEY WILL TELL YOU THERE'S A HUGE PROBLEM WITH COUNTY IS NOT -- GETTING. ENOUGH MONEY FROM THE STATE TO COVER THE COSTS IN ITS JUST AS ONGOING OUR PROBLEM THAT IS A GROUP REACHING WHAT I WOULD SAY A PAX RIGHT NOW -- AND WE'VE GOT THIS LACK OF WORKERS IT AS AMENDED JUST THAT PEOPLE NEED TO BE RECRUITED TO DO THIS WORK BUT WHY SHOULD THEY DO THAT WHEN THEY COULD GO WORK AT MCDONALDS. AND HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS STRESS AND GET PAID THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY. SO WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM BUT OUT OF PROBLEM IS OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING NEW AND SIGNIFICANT AND DIFFERENT [INAUDIBLE] AND FOR THE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF YOU W. WE SEE THE ONLY SOLUTION TO THIS CRISIS BEING. THE CREATION OF A SOCIAL INSURANCE MODEL BECAUSE WHAT WE'VE LEARNED THROUGH STUDYING PRIVATE INDUSTRY AND PRIVATE INSURANCE. IS THAT IT IS SIMPLY NOT A PROFITABLE PRODUCT NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE BUY THE PRODUCT TO OFFSET THE RISK FOR THE PEOPLE WHO USE IT. SO FROM INSURANCE PERSPECTIVE UNLESS YOU MANDATE BUT EVERYBODY BY IT AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENED WITH THAT EXPERIMENT BICU YEARS AGO. OF OR RECENTLY OF YOU MANDATE EITHER YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE MANDATING EVERYBODY BY THE INSURANCE OR YOU'RE APPROACHING IT FROM A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ANGLE WHICH IS A SOCIAL INSURANCE MODEL WHICH I WOULD ARGUE IS BEHIND. THE SUCCESS OF THOSE PROGRAMS THAT WE DO HAVE LIKE SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE PEOPLE. PEOPLE DON'T EVEN REALIZE THEY'RE PAYING INTO IT THERE IS NOW A SOCIETAL EXPECTATION THAT THIS IS WHAT YOU WORK TOWARD AN URN AND HAVE. TO EXPECT AS YOU GET OLDER AND WE NEED TO SEE THE SAME THING HAPPENED IN THIS ARENA AND FRANKLY LIKE SUSAN SAID MOST PEOPLE THINK IT'S ALREADY THE CASE IT'S JUST ACTUALLY NOT. SO WE'VE GOT TO FIX THAT. AND IF THIS IS AN OVERWHELMING -- ISSUE DON'T GET ME WRONG IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S THIS YOU KNOW THERE'S LIKE ONE PAGE HERE'S THE ANSWER WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT AND WARY. NO WORKING WITH A LOT OF FOLKS IN THE ROOM ON ON DOING THE HARD WORK OF THAT. SO I THINK OUT OF CRISIS COMES OPPORTUNITY AND THIS COMMITTEE CAN PLAY A REALLY IMPORTANT ROLE BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A SEXY ISSUE. THIS ISN'T SOMETHING PEOPLE LIKE PARKING A I IT IT'S A CRISIS THAT GOES IN ISOLATION IN ON RECOGNIZED AND FRANKLY I'M SHOCKED THAT MORE. A PEOPLE RUNNING FOR OFFICE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT BECAUSE I WOULD THINK THIS CROSSES EVERY. DAM AGE GROUP DEMOGRAPHIC YOU NAME IT PEOPLE NEED TO START TALKING ABOUT IT. AND SO LET ME JUST LEAVE IT WITH THIS WE BELIEVE THAT THE ANSWER IS THE CREATION OF A SOCIAL INSURANCE MODEL. WE WANT TO WORK WITH -- ALL OUR LEGISLATIVE A CHAMPIONS TO DO THIS AND WITH OUR OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO DO THIS. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY I WOULD SAY ONCE IN A GENERATION RIGHT NOW TO DO WE HAVE A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY AND AND IF WE DON'T THEN. SHAME ON US. MAY I ALSO JUST SAY ONE LAST THING THE ONE THING THAT THE STATE CAN DO LEGISLATIVELY TO ADDRESS. THE WRECK IT ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT'S IN THE TASK FORCE REPORT. IS THE FACT THAT PARENT AND SPOUSE. I JUST AS PROVIDERS SAID THIS IS PROVIDERS WHO CARE FOR THE CHILD OR A SPOUSE. ARE NOT ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN MEDICARE OR SOCIAL SECURITY OR DO NOT AND DO NOT QUALIFY FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE THAT IS AN IMMEDIATE. POLICY PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BECAUSE YOU COULD LITERALLY WORK YOUR WHOLE ADULT LIFE AND I JUST SAYS. AND HAVE ZERO WHEN YOU RETIRE AND WE ALL KNOW SOCIAL SECURITY IS NOT MUCH TO BEGIN WITH BUT YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE THAT. AND IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PREVENTING THE IMPOVERISHMENT OF CAREGIVERS FAMILY CARRIERS THAT IS THE NUMBER ONE POLICY PERSCRIPTION THAT I WOULD OFFER THE PROBLEM IS. THAT THE MEDICARE SOCIAL SECURITY ISSUES A FEDERAL ISSUE SO THE CHANCES OF THAT GETTING FIXED. OUR ABOUT AS GOOD AS MY CHANCE OF FLOATING OUT OF THIS ROOM. BUT THAT'S NOT GONNA BE TRUE FOR ALL WAYS IN THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE ISSUE ACTUALLY CAN BE ADDRESS ON THE STATE LEVEL SO WE DO WANT TO WORK WITH OTHER ADVOCATES AND WITH THE COMMITTEE ON THAT AS WELL SO LET ME JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT. THINK [INAUDIBLE] THANK YOU. AND WE WILL AND THE RESPONDENT PANEL THE DOCTOR NINA. Y. THEIR HEART WELL YOU KNOW WE WERE HIGHER WELL BUT THEY ARE P. CALIFORNIA. YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND SO ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTED TO BE HERE TODAY. THROUGH THE END OF ALMOST A FOR YOUR JOURNEY. ARM WE BEGAN THIS EFFORT WORKING WITH COMMISSIONER AROUND AT THE END OF FIVE YEAR FIVE YEAR TWENTY THIRTEEN TO INTRODUCE THE TASK FORCE LEGISLATION. AS SHE SAID THE GOV YOU DOWN WITH THAT ONE BACK TO THE WELL. ON INTRODUCED AS A RESOLUTION IF PASSED YOU OVERWHELMINGLY AND WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND THE ERROR P. AND ARCHED ON STEPS AND AND HERE WE ARE. I'M I JUST WONDERING KNOWLEDGE THE TASK FORCE'S WELL ALTHOUGH I WASN'T A MEMBER. I PARTICIPATED IN MOST OF THE MEETINGS AND I JUST WANT TO SAY WE REALLY APPRECIATE OF THE PROCESS AS WELL AS THE TASK FORCE. FORCES OPENNESS TO OUR RECOMMENDATIONS [INAUDIBLE] ARM. SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS ON THE TASK FORCE AS WELL AS IN THE ROOM. AND SACRAMENTO AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE. TO REALLY MAKE REAL THESE RECOMMENDATIONS SO THAT THIS IS NOT JUST ANOTHER REPORT THAT SITS ON THE SHELF. AND THANKS TO ARM. THE OFFER OF OUR STATE DIRECTOR NANCY MCPHERSON HERE HERE P. AS WE SAID BEFORE WILL BE HOSTING. STRATEGY SESSION ON LATER THIS SUMMER SIR PUT TOGETHER CAMPAIGN PLANS AND ACTIONABLE. ON ACTIONABLE LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS THAT WE WILL BRING FORTH IN. TWENTY NINETEEN SO I JUST WANNA HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE REALLY RESUME RESONATED WITH A A RP. AND I WILL SAY THAT EVERY. EVERY SINGLE RECOMMENDATION ON HERE. DOES ONLINE WITH A A RP POLICY ON WITH THEIR SOME THERE REALLY FOR US RISE TO THE FOR AND REALLY NUMBER -- ONE KRISTIN YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT IT WAS A TOPIC OF LDS US FINANCING. ARM A RP YOU DO W. RASPING SEIU AND SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS IN THIS ROOM ARE MEMBERS OF A PART OF A TWENTY TWO MEMBER. ALLIANCE CALLED THE FELT THE CALIFORNIA HE AGING AND DISABILITY ALLIANCE. AND WE ARE SAT ON A ROCK WORSE A LONG TERM STRATEGY TO REALLY MAKE LONG TERM SO. TO MAKE LONG TERM SUPPORTS AND SERVICES MORE AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE FOR A LOT MORE CALIFORNIANS AND I DO WANNA CALL OUT ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA. WHO PLAYED AN IMPORTANT PART IN OUR FIRST WIN WHICH MAY NOT SOUND LIKE MUCH? BUT IT WAS A BUDGET REQUEST TO GET THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY WAS THREE MILLION DOLLARS. ON TO START COLLECTING DATA ON NEED FOR AN ACCESS TO LONG TERM CARE OF LONG TERM SUPPORTS AND SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WE HAD NOTHING. YOU CAN'T PLAN FOR SAY ALL LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE PROGRAM IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY NEED. ARM AND WERE WERE COMING TO A POINT WHERE WE'RE GONNA HAVE AS MANY PEOPLE OVER SIXTY HAS PEOPLE UNDER NINETEEN AND STATE THE STATE NEEDS TO GET SERIOUS AND THANKFULLY. NO. LEGISLATORS LIKE ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA AND OTHER MEMBERS OF ONE OF THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL AS THE ADMINISTRATION RECOGNIZES AND THIS BUDGET REQUEST GOT THROUGH THE FIRST. SO WE STAND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CAN CONTINUE TO WORK WITH LEGISLATORS AGAIN AS WELL AS THE ALLIANCE ON THIS [INAUDIBLE] FROM. I DO WANT TO ALSO TALK A BIT ABOUT THE CARE GIVER TAX CREDIT WHICH WE PLAYED A ROLE IN IN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN ARM WE WORKED WITH OUTSIDE MURZA MESSED SOCIETY AND I THINK SOME OTHER FOLKS IN THE ROOM ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA WITH THE ARTHUR. AND UNFORTUNATELY DIED IN A CERTAIN COMMITTEE BUT WE WILL LOOK FORWARD TO REINTRODUCING OUT AGAIN ESPECIALLY AS WE'RE WAITING FOR THIS LONG TERM CARE FINANCING MEASURE WHICH WILL TAKE SOME TIME TO BUILD UP. WE NEED TO HAVE SOME KIND OF INTERIM MEASURE TO HEALTH CARE GIVERS. COVER THE COST OF FAMILY CAREGIVING. AUTUMN I DON'T THINK THIS HAS BEEN MENTIONED YET TODAY BUT A A RP RESEARCH FROM. TWENTY SIXTEEN THE COST OF CARE GIVING. SHOWED THAT THE AVERAGE FAMILY CAREGIVER FOR AND AN ADULT AND ADDED THREE WHO IS CARING FOR ANY ADULT WITH A DISABILITY. IT'S SPENDING ON AVERAGE NEARLY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR OUT OF POCKET. AND IF THEY ARE CARING FOR A LOVED ONE WITHOUT SOME ROOMS. IT'S OVER TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. VERY FEW PEOPLE CAN SAY FOR THAT. VERY FEW PEOPLE EVEN HAVE THE MEANS TO SAVE FOR THAT AND ONLY ABOUT 5% OF CALIFORNIANS EVEN HAVE LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE. THAT REALLY HIGHLIGHTS WHY WE NEED. SOME KIND OF HEALTH LONG TERM CARE FINANCING MEASURE AS WELL HAS JUST TAX CREDIT THE LEARNED MENTIONED. PAID FAMILY LEAVE IS ANOTHER I DON'T TRY TO GO QUICKLY TO RESPECT TIME HERE -- AS GENO'S ACT PAID FAMILY LEAVE AS A NATIONAL A OR P. PRIORITY AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH. ALL THE WORK OF THE THE WORKING FAMILY COALITION ON THE SURVEY THAT CHEN YOU REFERENCED. AND WE'RE REALLY HOPING THAT CALIFORNIA CAN FINALLY. GETS TO THE POINT WHERE IT INTRODUCES AND PASSES AND SIGNS LEGISLATION THAT ADDS JOB PROTECTIONS FOR THOSE WHO TAKE PAID FAMILY LEAVE WE BELIEVE THAT THAT IS. ALL A BIG HINDRANCE TO PEOPLE EVEN TAKING LEAVE RICHARD AS SHE NOTED WE'VE RECENTLY SEEN AN INCREASE IN THE WAGE REPLACEMENT RATE. THAT JUST CAME IN THE SURE THAT'LL HELP A BET. BUT IF FOLKS WORKING FOR SMALL BUSINESSES CANNOT THAT'S UNDER FIFTY OF OUR PEOPLE WORKING FOR EMPLOYERS WITH FIFTY OR FEWER EMPLOYEES. IF YOU CANNOT BE GUARANTEED THAT ARE GONNA HAVE A JOB TO GO BACK. TO AT YOU TAKE PAID FAMILY LEAVE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE. ARMS SO WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT AND WE STILL HAVE THAT THE READY TO HELP WITH THAT. AND WE ALSO SUPPORT BEYOND MEASURE HIM BERKELEY WHICH I KNOW IS GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS CITY COUNCIL HOME. THE REPORT MENTIONED NURSE DELEGATION. A NURSE TELEVISION IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO HEAR RP. CALIFORNIA I DON'T KNOW IF YOU BOTH HUMAN HOA KELLEHER ARP AND SCANNED PUTS OUT SOMETHING CALLED THE LTFS SCORECARD. A NURSE DEL ADDITION CALIFORNIA RANKS. FORTY FOR BECAUSE IN CALIFORNIA NURSES CAN ONLY DELEGATE TO OF SIXTEEN MEDICAL TASK TO A PAID. HOME CARE WORKER. AND THAT MEANS THAT FOR EXAMPLE I'M PAYING A HOME CARE WORKER. SO I CAN GO TO WORK OR I CAN WE TO WORK PART TIME. BUT I MIGHT HAVE TO HAS A CAREGIVER I MEAN YOU HAVE TO GO HOME AND DO SOME OF THESE MEDICAL TESTS AT HOME LIKE TO FEEDING OR MEDICATION MANAGEMENT. A WINDOW THAT WILL REQUIRE STRONG LEADERSHIP IN THE LEGISLATURE HUAMBO WERE REALLY HOPING A FEW DOT COM COME TO BE. FINALLY TELEHEALTH AND I'M JUST HIGHLIGHTING SOME WE SUPPORT ALL TELEHEALTH. ROM TELEHEALTH IS REAL IMPORTANT A. R. P. ALSO RECEIVED IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO HELP FAMILY CAREGIVERS AND THERE ARE RECENTLY RELEASED AARP PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE REPORT. ON TELL HEALTH AND FAMILY CAREGIVERS IS ACTUALLY IN YOUR PACKET. ALL JUST YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE CENTER FOR HELP CONNECTED HEALTH POLICIES. ELECTRONIC CONSOLES WORKGROUP. AND JUSTICE YOUR RE SIGNED ON TO A COALITION LETTER. TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES SO THIS WOULD BE AN ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGE. ARM ASKING A TO EXPAND EXISTING MEDI CAL FUNDED HEALTH TELEHEALTH SERVICES TO INCLUDE ANY CONSOLE SERVICES FOR ALL SPECIALTIES. SO AS IT MOVES FORWARD WE WILL MAKE SURE TO KEEP. EVERYONE A PRIZE WHERE THAT IS SO AGAIN I THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE AND LOOK FORWARD. TO WORKING TOGETHER FOR MANY YEARS TO COME. THANK YOU WELL LET'S HAVE A ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR ALL OF OUR RESPONDENTS HERE. SHE IT'S EXCITING TO HAVE SUCH A GREAT TEAM OF FOLKS THAT.

A WHAT WAS EXPECTED I WOULD NOT KNOW THE QUESTIONS TO ASK. AND THERE WERE SOME THINGS THAT WERE SUGGESTED THAT I DID NOT AGREE WITH BECAUSE I KNOW PATIENTS RIGHTS I KNOW QUALITY OF CARE AND I KNOW QUALITY OF LIFE. GETTING BACK TO YOU I RETYPE THEM FROM THAT AGENCY HOME A HEALTH FACILITY INSPECTION DIVISION.

AND BECAUSE I'M ALSO A FORMER MEMBER OF CGA I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO IS SPECIFICALLY TO IS HE AYE YOU AND AND THE OTHER ORGANIZATION BECAUSE ONE THING THAT IS LACKING HERE. IS A QUESTION OF CERTIFICATION. THIS IS THE REASON WHY THEY ARE NOT CONSIDERED PROFESSIONAL WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS TO INCLUDE IT IN THE HOUSE. OF PROGRAM OF EDUCATION. THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CERTIFYING THAT ANYONE WHO IS A HEALTH CARE GIVER IS CERTIFIED TO BE A PROFESSIONAL OR SEMI PROFESSIONAL. THIS WILL TAKE CARE OF THE MINIMUM WAGE IT ALSO WILL IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE HOME CARE AND NUMBER. THREE AS TO THE FEDERAL PROGRAM LET ME SAY IT SHOULD BE A PART OF SOCIAL SECURITY. A PART OF MEDICARE. THAT IT SHOULD BE A HEALTH CONCERN THAT MEET ALL THE NEEDS OF ALL AMERICANS AND IF WE DID NOT HAVE TO DOUBLE DEALING WHERE. TEACHERS ARE NOT PERMITTED TO BE IS SOCIAL SECURITY BECAUSE I DID NOT RECEIVE IT. IF IT WAS ALL OPEN AS AN OPTION. IT WOULD ALSO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY. THAT WOULD BE PERMITTED AND PROVIDE. FOR ALL SERVICE SAYS NEEDED UP BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES SO THEREFORE WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE REVAMPING OF HEALTH CARE. THE HEALTH INDUSTRY AND THE INCLUSION. OF HOME CARE. DEALERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU [INAUDIBLE] THANK DR. BITING ME TODAY I HAVE BEEN A CLOSE HER PROGRAM TWELVE YEARS. OKAY OF MOTHER FATHER AND AND AND WITHOUT THAT PROGRAM. WE COULD NOT HAVE DONE IT AND ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE COME UP THE FINANCIAL EVERYTHING ELSE WE ARE DEALING WITH NOW AS WE ARE ON SOCIAL SECURITY BUT LOOKING AT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO US.

WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IF WE GO DOWN [INAUDIBLE] THANK YOU. ARE THOSE VERY TIMELY BECAUSE I JUST WANNA GO AHEAD AN ECHO SOME OF THOSE THOUGHTS MY NAME'S JACK LIED IN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR THE FAMILY CAREGIVER RESOURCE CENTER IN ORANGE COUNTY. AND I WANTED TO JUST SHARE SOME OF MY EXPERIENCES ARE BUT MOST NOTABLY I WANTED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF OF THE MILLENNIAL CAREGIVERS AND YOUNGER CARE GIVERS. A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WE'RE SEEING IN OUR OFFICES WORK. THEY'RE NOT LOOKING AT BROAD POLICY DECISIONS THAT YOU VOTE BUT THEY DO WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHY THEY CAN'T SPEND THEIR FLEXIBLE SAVINGS ACCOUNT. TO PAY FOR SOME OF THE HOME CARE FOR THEIR LOVED ONES THEY WANT TO ASK. THEY DON'T THAT THE ONLY PERSON DOESN'T ASK ABOUT WHAT MEDICARE IS OUR DOESN'T MEDICARE PAY FOR THAT. BUT THE QUESTION WAS SAID DOES MEDICARE PAY FOR THAT. THE SIX MILLENNIAL THAT I PROVIDED THERE BECAUSE I'M A CLINICAL THERAPIST BY TRADE I DO THERAPY FOR OUR CENTER. OF MILLIONS COME IN THERE EVEN THOUGH THAT MEDICARE EVEN EXISTS. BUT THEY'RE DROPPING OUT OF SCHOOL. THEY'RE PROVIDING CARE AND WHAT THEY'RE LEARNING AND WHAT OUR WORKING FOLK. WORKING CAREGIVERS ARE LURKING LEARNING IS THAT THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH OUR LONG TERM CARE SYSTEM. THEY CAN'T PIECE IT TOGETHER IT'S FRAGMENTED AND EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE EDUCATED WORKING. I CANNOT FIND A WAY TO GET THEIR LOVED ONE THE CARE THEY THINK THEY NEED. AND YES THEY ARE. AT WORK BUT THEY'RE REALLY NOT AND THAT'S THAT SUB. A IT'S NOT A BENEFIT TO THEIR EMPLOYER AND LASTING UNLIKE SAY'S IS ON THE TASK FORCE OF THE COMPUTER GOES FORWARD I THINK WOULD LIKE TO INCLUDE SOME SOME -- I'D LIKE TO SEE SOME REPRESENTATION FROM. EMPLOYERS LARGE EMPLOYERS BECAUSE I DO A LOT OF LUNCH AND LEARNS AND THEY ARE ALWAYS FULL AND AND AND EMPLOYERS ARE OUT THERE AND THEY WANT TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE TOO MUCH LIKE THE THEY'VE ADDRESSED THE ISSUE OF CHILDCARE. THEY WANT THEIR THEY DON'T WANT TURN OVER THEY WANT THEIR EMPLOYEES HAPPY AND ENGAGED TO WORK [INAUDIBLE] THANK YOU. THE VERY VERY BACK. HI MY NAME IS NADIA TORONTO AND I JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF A LOW LIFE AND GETTING EMOTIONAL. SOME TRIED. TO COMPOSE MYSELF I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I AM A LAY PERSON AND I USED TO WORK FOR A FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES -- AS A BANKER. WHICH I HAD TO RETIRE EARLY BECAUSE I DID HAVE ACCESS TO FAMILY MIL OF FAMILY LEAVE BUT IT JUST GOT TOO INVOLVED BECAUSE AS MY PARENTS AGE OF FORCING MY FATHER PASSED OF DEMENTIA. IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AND MY MOTHER WHO'S NINETY FOUR VERY LUCID [INAUDIBLE] AND DOWN. BUT SHE IS DISMISSED BUT BECAUSE THE CARE HAS EVOLVED I HAD TO RETIRE EARLY. I AM VERY GRATEFUL FOR U. S. C. WILL -- INDUCTED -- FIT TEN I MET HER JUST RECENTLY AND I HAVE THE COOK CALM THE SUPPORT GROUP AT TRAIN WITH. OF MISS BOBBI BIT OF MISS BOBBI. BUT I JUST WANT IS SAYING. WHATEVER I CAN DO TO HELP. WITH GETTING THIS. MUCH NEEDED INDUSTRY ON TRACK. WE ALL KNEW THAT THE BABY BOOMERS WERE AGING I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE WERE BETTER PREPARED BUT WE CAN'T GO BACKWARDS. BUT WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS PARTICIPATE AS A LAY PERSON WHATEVER I CAN DO I AM WITH YOU. AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THERE'S GENERAL. PLACES WHERE I BELIEVE PROFIT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN PEOPLE -- I HAVE BEEN. INVOLVED AND TRIED TO GET THE OMBUDSMAN TO COME OUT. TO A FACILITY FACILITY THAT WAS. DEFICIENT MI JUST THAT MY OBSERVATION TRIED TO GET THE OMBUDSMAN'S OUT HE'S OVERWORKED DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL. OF SEVERITY HE HAD TO GO TO OTHER -- CLIENTS A HE JUST TOLD ME OUT RIGHT THAT HE WAS JUST OVERWORKED THERE WEREN'T ENOUGH PEOPLE IN THE INDUSTRY TO OVERSEE. COME TO FIND OUT THE FACILITY THAT MY MOTHER WAS AND WAS NOT EVEN APPROVED [INAUDIBLE] HEALTH AND THE PERSON THAT OWNED THE FACILITY GOT IT THROUGH BANKRUPTCY. AND IT WASN'T EVEN AUTHORIZED AND THIS PERSON. IS GETTING A LOT OF HIS FACILITIES. I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER THE DELEON [INAUDIBLE] VERBIAGE. THE CERTIFIED I BELIEVE THEY'RE TAKING THE FACILITIES AWAY FROM HIM BECAUSE OF DEFICIENCIES THAT WERE. GIVEN TO HIM AND HE HAS NOT ACTED UPON IT. SO YOU KNOW IT'S JUST A MATTER OF PUT PUTTING THE PEOPLE FIRST MAYBE HAVING TO SOCIALIZE. AND I KNOW WITH US WAS TUGWELL SOCIALISM BUT A SOCIALISTIC DEMAGOGUE DEMOCRACY BUT SOMETHING HAS TO HAPPEN. WHERE? PEOPLE COME FIRST BEFORE PRACTICE [INAUDIBLE] THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH -- AND YES I WAS HEAD OF THE MIDDLE THERE -- FOR SHE WAS OF YOUR CARE CAREGIVER FOR MY GRANDPARENTS -- NOW'S A CAREGIVER FOR MY FATHER I'M I'M A STUDENT AT JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY AND THIS IS A GREAT CONVERSATION -- I WANTED TO ASK IS THERE BEEN ANY CONSIDERATIONS TAKEN -- INTO TAPPING INTO THE STUDENT DEBT. SO I AM SO IF WE CAN FINANCIALLY TAP INTO THE STUDENT DEBT AND HAVE IT COULD BE RECYCLED BACK INTO THE STATE. I THINK THAT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING TO CONSIDER BECAUSE THERE'S A FINANCIAL BURDEN -- WITH CAREGIVING AND AS LONG. DO NOT TAKE -- MAJOR SUCH AS HEALTHCARE INTO ACCOUNT SO IF THAT'S POSSIBLE CONSIDERATION THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK RHODE ISLAND AND ARM I LIVE IN MARYLAND NOW I'M ORIGINALLY FROM CALIFORNIA BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT -- THEY HAVE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION ESPECIALLY AS TEACHERS. THANK YOU FOR THE SUGGESTION. OKAY COME ANYONE ELSE'S GOOD WILL TAKE THESE LAST TWO K.. SO BURDEN LITTLEJOHN THE SIDE. ARE THE ORDER. AREA. THANK YOU I REALLY ENJOYED A HEARING ON THE INFORMATION THAT THEY ARE. NOT KNOWN ABOUT THIS COMMITTEE UNTIL JUST YESTERDAY I WAS AT A ASSEMBLY MEMBER COME LATER DUBS -- OPEN HOUSE BUT I'M I'M A FINANCIAL PLANNER AND I EDUCATE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ABOUT LONG TERM CARE PLANNING BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST PITFALLS -- IN DOING A RETIREMENT PLAN. AND LOT OF PEOPLE AS THE PANEL BEEPED OR SAYING. DON'T REALIZE THAT IT'S NOT COVERED BY THEIR MEDICAL INSURANCE IS NOT COVERED BY MEDICARE. AND THE ONLY WAY THAT THEY HAVE A SAFETY NET IS WHAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR A CALIFORNIAN. AND THIS IS A HUGE TICKING FINANCIAL FISCAL TIME BOMB. AND LOT OF PEOPLE REALIZE IT BUT I AS ONE OF THE OTHER PANEL MEMBERS MENTIONED -- ONLY ABOUT FIVE OR 6% OF PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY HAVE LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE. SO THAT MEANS 95% OF THE PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE INSURANCE AND DON'T HAVE ASSETS. ARE GONNA END UP ON SOME KIND THE STATE ASSISTANCE THERE'S NO WAY THE STATE CAN AFFORD THAT SO. I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH WE CAN DO FOR PEOPLE RIGHT NOW OBVIOUSLY THESE ARE PEOPLE HERE THAT I DO SOME GREAT THINGS I BELIEVE. BUT WE CAN LOOK AT THE NEXT WAVE OF PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING WE ARE THAT WAVE OF PEOPLE. TWENTY YEARS FROM NOW THIRTY YEARS FROM NOW IN EL OUR CHILDREN GRANDCHILDREN TO BE TALKING ABOUT US. AND HOW TAKE CARE OF US SO WHAT I TRY TO DO IS EDUCATE PEOPLE ON WHAT CAN YOU DO NOW IF YOU HAVE THE MEANS. OF PLANNING NOW IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO BUY INSURANCE BUT YOU GOT TO HAVE SOME KIND OF PLAN. SO I ALWAYS TALK TO PEOPLE BY HAVING SOME TYPE OF THE PLANETS NOT ALL MY KIDS GONNA TAKE YOUR ME ON MY DAUGHTER'S GONNA TAKE CARE BECAUSE THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE THE CASE. THAT'S NOT YOUR PLAN AND SO ON IF THERE'S ANYTHING I CAN DO TO HELP WITH THIS COMMITTEE LIKE I SAID I DO TALK TO DO WORKSHOPS. AND HELP EDUCATE PEOPLE ABOUT PLANNING FOR LONG TERM CANNOT BE HAPPY TO BE PART OF THAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND THEN I'VE OF FINAL THE PUBLIC COMMENT.
