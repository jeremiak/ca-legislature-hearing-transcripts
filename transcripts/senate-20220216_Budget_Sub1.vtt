GROWTH. IN THE CURRENT YEAR SO

00:08:20.566 --> 00:08:22.568
THIS COULD MEAN SOME LEVEL OF

00:08:22.635 --> 00:08:24.737
GROWTH FUNDING IS WARRANTED FOR

00:08:24.804 --> 00:08:26.272

RETENTION AND ROMAN STRATEGIES.

00:08:45.324 --> 00:08:46.359
THAT ONE MIGHT BE A LITTLE

00:08:46.425 --> 00:08:48.327
TRICKIER FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

00:08:48.394 --> 00:08:50.329

FOR THE SAME PURPOSE. NOW

00:08:58.004 --> 00:09:00.273
COLLEGES WERE NOT REQUIRED TO

REPORT ON HOW MUCH THEY HAVE

00:09:02.475 --> 00:09:04.543
LEFT OF THAT MONEY.OR WHETHER

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:06.379
THE FUNDS THEY SPENT TO DATE

00:09:06.445 --> 00:09:09.282
HAVE SHOWN. SUCCESS IN IN

00:09:09.348 --> 00:09:11.384
BRINGING BACK STUDENTS ARE

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:12.718
BRINGING BACK MORE STUDENTS THAN

00:09:12.785 --> 00:09:13.686
OTHERWISE MIGHT HAVE BEEN

00:09:13.753 --> 00:09:15.721
ENROLLED IN THE COLLEGE'S SO

00:09:15.788 --> 00:09:16.489
IT'S GONNA BE HARDER FOR THE

00:09:16.555 --> 00:09:18.991
LEGISLATURE. TO ASSESS WHETHER

00:09:19.058 --> 00:09:21.060
ANOTHER ROUND OF FUNDING FOR

00:09:21.127 --> 00:09:23.162
THAT PURPOSE IS- PROMISING OR

00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:25.197
NOT- IN ADDITION THERE ARE%

00:09:25.264 --> 00:09:27.400
SURVEYS AND RESEARCHES SUGGEST

00:09:27.466 --> 00:09:29.936
THE MAJOR REASONS WHY. ADULTS

00:09:30.002 --> 00:09:31.170
ARE NOT COMING TO THE COLLEGES

00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:32.738
RIGHT NOW AS WE NEED TO WORK ON

00:09:32.805 --> 00:09:34.340

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:36.375
FINANCIAL SITUATION OR NEED TO

CARE FOR OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS

00:09:37.843 --> 00:09:39.545
DURING THIS TIME. SO IF THAT'S

00:09:39.612 --> 00:09:41.147
THE CASE IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER

00:09:41.213 --> 00:09:42.815
ADDITIONAL MONEY FOR ADVERTISING

00:09:42.882 --> 00:09:44.750
OR PHONE BANKS ARE EITHER OUT OF

00:09:44.817 --> 00:09:47.520
REACH OUR WILL BE AFFECTED BUT

00:09:47.586 --> 00:09:48.754
THE LEGISLATURE COULD PROVIDE

00:09:48.821 --> 00:09:50.990
THE MONEY. ANOTHER OPTION IS TO

00:09:51.057 --> 00:09:52.725
PROVIDE THE MONEY TO GET IT-

00:09:52.792 --> 00:09:54.727
MAKE IT MORE FLEXIBLE SO THAT

00:09:54.794 --> 00:09:56.495
COLLEGES MIGHT BE ABLE TO USE IT

00:09:56.562 --> 00:09:58.431
FOR OUR RECRUITMENT NOT REACH

00:09:58.497 --> 00:09:59.565
BUT ALSO USE IT FOR OTHER

00:09:59.632 --> 00:10:01.834
PURPOSES SUCH AS- MENTAL HEALTH

00:10:01.901 --> 00:10:03.803
SERVICES FOR STUDENTS. OR TO

00:10:03.869 --> 00:10:06.005
HELP WITH COVERED MITIGATION-

00:10:06.072 --> 00:10:08.407
SERVICES ARE SCREENING AND

00:10:08.474 --> 00:10:10.176
TESTING AND CLEAN AND THAT SORT

00:10:10.242 --> 00:10:12.078
OF THING SO ANOTHER OPTION IS TO

00:10:12.144 --> 00:10:13.646
SERVE AND MAYBE HAVE A COVERT

00:10:13.713 --> 00:10:15.848
TYPE BLOCK GRANT. THAT COULD BE

00:10:15.915 --> 00:10:22.021
USED FOR MORE THAN JUST OUR.

00:10:22.088 --> 00:10:22.989

00:14:51.323 --> 00:14:53.459
WORK WE CONTINUE TO ALIGN OUR

00:14:53.525 --> 00:14:54.560
EFFORTS AROUND THE VISION FOR

00:14:54.627 --> 00:14:56.629
SUCCESS AND YOU SEE THE ROADMAP

00:14:56.695 --> 00:14:59.164
IS COMPLEMENTARY WHAT THE ROAD

00:14:59.231 --> 00:15:01.767
MAP PROVIDES IS ADDED MOMENTUM

00:15:01.834 --> 00:15:04.937
TO THE WORK- THAT IS INDICATED

00:15:05.004 --> 00:15:07.473
IN THE VISION FOR SUCCESS. EVERY

00:15:07.539 --> 00:15:09.675
MADE THE CHANGES OFFICE PROVIDES

00:15:09.742 --> 00:15:11.610
A STATE OF THE SYSTEM REPORT

00:15:11.677 --> 00:15:13.078
WHERE WE SHARE WITH OUR

00:15:13.145 --> 00:15:14.913
STAKEHOLDERS AND PARTNERS WHERE

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:16.915
WE ARE IN RESPECT TO THAT THE

00:15:16.982 --> 00:15:19.018
FIRST TIME THAT AS A SYSTEM

00:15:19.084 --> 00:15:20.619
WE'VE BEEN DOCUMENTING AND

00:15:20.686 --> 00:15:23.622
TRACKING. OUR WORKER GOALS ANY

00:15:23.689 --> 00:15:25.991
GAINS WE THINK THAT THIS IS-

00:15:26.058 --> 00:15:28.027
CONTINUES TO BE IMPORTANT ALSO

00:15:28.093 --> 00:15:29.995
NOTE THAT COLLEGES UNDER

00:15:30.062 --> 00:15:32.331
ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHTEEN OH NINE

00:15:32.398 --> 00:15:34.800
WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED IN TWO

00:15:34.867 --> 00:15:36.302
THOUSAND EIGHT ALSO HAVE LOCAL

00:15:36.368 --> 00:15:37.736
VISION GOALS THAT ARE ALIGNED

00:15:37.803 --> 00:15:40.239
WITH THE VISION FOR SUCCESS. SO

00:15:40.306 --> 00:15:41.206
WE DO THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT

00:15:41.273 --> 00:15:45.477
TO. KEEP THIS FOCUSED AS IT

00:15:45.544 --> 00:15:47.046
ALIGNS EFFORTS AROUND

00:15:47.112 --> 00:15:49.682
COMPLETION. TIME 2 DEGREES

00:15:49.748 --> 00:15:52.751
UNITED TEAM AND ALL THINGS THAT

00:15:52.818 --> 00:15:55.788
ARE OFTEN HIGHLIGHTED THE MAP BY-MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE AS

00:15:55.854 --> 00:16:01.360
PRIORITIES THEN LET ME. STICK

00:16:01.427 --> 00:16:02.795
WITH THAT FOR A MINUTE. BECAUSE

00:16:02.861 --> 00:16:05.698
I'M GATHERING A RATHER. QUESTION

00:16:05.764 --> 00:16:08.067
SO- GAP. THAT YOU WILL TAKE THE

00:16:08.133 --> 00:16:09.702
GOALS THAT ARE IN THE VISION

00:16:09.768 --> 00:16:12.237
SUCCESS KEEP THEM AS GOALS AND

00:16:12.304 --> 00:16:14.173
STILL MEASURE AGAINST THEM EVEN

00:16:14.239 --> 00:16:15.674
THOUGH IT WAS ORIGINALLY STE

00:16:15.741 --> 00:16:18.777
ESTABLISHED AS A FIVE YEAR TIME

00:16:18.844 --> 00:16:20.679
HORIZON IS THAT CORRECT. CORRECT

00:16:20.746 --> 00:16:22.781
WE SOMETHING TO THE RIGHT

00:16:22.848 --> 00:16:24.149
DIRECTION TO BE MOVING IN THE

00:16:24.216 --> 00:16:25.951
RIGHT FOCUS AREAS AND ON A

00:16:26.018 --> 00:16:28.754
PERCENTAGE THAT YOU HAVE.

00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:32.524
ACHIEVED IN THE FIVE YEARS. HOW

00:16:32.591 --> 00:16:34.593
DID THOSE ALIGNED WITH WHAT

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.595
YOU'RE GOAL WAS FOR ACHIEVEMENT

00:16:36.662 --> 00:16:38.897
IN THOSE PERCENTAGES IN THOSE

00:16:38.964 --> 00:16:43.302
FIVE YEARS. WE'VE SEEN SOME-

00:16:43.369 --> 00:16:45.037
STALL- AS A RESULT OF THE

00:16:45.104 --> 00:16:46.939
PANDEMIC AND SOME OF THE

00:16:47.005 --> 00:16:48.574
COMPLICATIONS OF THE LAST FEW

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.809
YEARS BUT WE DO THINK IT'S

00:16:50.876 --> 00:16:52.611
IMPORTANT THAT COLLEGES HAVE TO

00:16:52.678 --> 00:16:56.081
KNOW THE COLLEGES HAVE MADE-TREMENDOUS GAINS PARTICULARLY IN

00:16:56.148 --> 00:17:00.552
AREAS AROUND- UNITS UNITED TEAM

00:17:00.619 --> 00:17:03.055
MEANT AND THE INTENSITY OF

00:17:03.122 --> 00:17:06.558
ENROLLMENT. OKAY AND THEN LET'S

00:17:06.625 --> 00:17:08.660
MOVE TO THE ROAD MAP BUT- I HAVE

00:17:08.727 --> 00:17:10.929
A COPY BUT IT IT WASN'T IN OUR

00:17:10.996 --> 00:17:14.299
AGENDA PACKET N. R. SHOULD MAKE-

00:17:14.366 --> 00:17:15.501
MAYBE I SHOULD ASK THIS IS A

00:17:15.567 --> 00:17:17.403
FORM OF A QUESTION FIRST BUT I

00:17:17.469 --> 00:17:19.605
THINK IT'S JUST A CLARIFICATION

00:17:19.671 --> 00:17:21.540
FOR OUR LISTENING AUDIENCE-

00:17:21.607 --> 00:17:23.442
WE'VE ALREADY HAD OUR HEARINGS

00:17:23.509 --> 00:17:26.979
ON UC AND CSU. AND IN EACH OF

00:17:27.045 --> 00:17:30.682
THOSE THERE WAS A COMPACT AND

00:17:30.749 --> 00:17:32.851
GROWTH WAS CONTINGENT ON THE

00:17:32.918 --> 00:17:38.924
COMPACT. AND- AND THEY WERE

00:17:38.991 --> 00:17:41.160
DISTINCTLY TIED TOGETHER. THIS

00:17:41.226 --> 00:17:43.662
IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE I BELIEVE

00:17:43.729 --> 00:17:45.564
COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE FUNDED BY

00:17:45.631 --> 00:17:47.533
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT AND

00:17:47.599 --> 00:17:49.201
IT'S NOT THE GENERAL FUND AND A

00:17:49.268 --> 00:17:50.936
DIRECT APPROPRIATION THE WAY IT

00:17:51.003 --> 00:17:55.140
IS WITH UC AND CSU. SO IS THE-

00:17:55.207 --> 00:17:57.509
AND MAYBE FINANCE CAN START ON

00:17:57.576 --> 00:18:01.313
THIS IT IS THE IDEA HERE THAT

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.182
THIS IS A ROAD MAP RATHER THAN A

00:18:03.248 --> 00:18:06.485
COMPACT BECAUSE WE HAVE PROP

00:18:06.552 --> 00:18:07.486
NINETY EIGHT AND- THEN A

00:18:07.553 --> 00:18:10.823
DECENTRALIZED SYSTEM AND- THAT

00:18:10.889 --> 00:18:12.558
THE MONEY THAT IS FUNDED FOR

00:18:12.624 --> 00:18:15.527
GROWTH HAS TO COME FROM PROP

00:18:15.594 --> 00:18:17.329
NINETY EIGHT SO IT'S A ROAD MAP.

00:18:17.396 --> 00:18:20.899
AND THEN WITH AVAILABLE PROP

00:18:20.966 --> 00:18:21.900
NINETY EIGHT FUNDS IS THAT

00:18:21.967 --> 00:18:24.803
CORRECT. I I'D SAY YES DINNER

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:25.804
FROM THE FINANCE THAT YES I'D

00:18:25.871 --> 00:18:26.905
SAY THAT'S LARGELY CORRECTED

00:18:26.972 --> 00:18:29.241
THAT- THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE

00:18:29.308 --> 00:18:30.542
FUNDED UNDERNEATH THE

00:18:30.609 --> 00:18:31.176
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

00:18:31.243 --> 00:18:33.011
GUARANTEE AND SO WE HAVE TO WORK

00:18:33.078 --> 00:18:34.713
WITHIN THOSE AVAILABLE RESOURCES

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.915
WHEN CONSIDERING- ONGOING

00:18:36.982 --> 00:18:38.183
FUNDING TOWARDS THE COMMUNITY

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:40.452
COLLEGES I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT

00:18:40.519 --> 00:18:41.453
FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THERE

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.489
IS THE- STATUTORY COST OF LIVING

00:18:43.555 --> 00:18:44.456
ADJUSTMENT THAT IT'S GONNA

00:18:44.523 --> 00:18:46.758
PLIED. TO THE STUDENT CENTERED

00:18:46.825 --> 00:18:48.794
FUNDING FORMULA- SO THERE IS

00:18:48.861 --> 00:18:51.763
SOME EXPECTATION OF CONTINUED

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:54.833
ONGOING FUNDING. AND THEN- LET

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:56.034
ME ASK AND MAYBE THEIR COMMUNITY

00:18:56.101 --> 00:18:57.669
COLLEGE SYSTEM AND THEN FINANCE

00:18:57.736 --> 00:19:00.706
OR DALY- CAN CHIME IN IF THEY

00:19:00.772 --> 00:19:04.376
WANT. UP ON THE ROAD MAP. FROM

00:19:04.443 --> 00:19:06.812
THE A THE REPRESENTATIVE

00:19:06.879 --> 00:19:08.247
COMMUNITY COLLEGES SAYS IT'S

00:19:08.313 --> 00:19:10.382
COMPLIMENTARY TO THE VISION FOR

00:19:10.449 --> 00:19:13.252
SUCCESS SO WHERE'S THE OVERLAP

00:19:13.318 --> 00:19:15.354
AND WIRES NOT THE OVERLAP WHERE

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:18.190
DOES THE ROAD MAP GO FURTHER

00:19:18.257 --> 00:19:20.859
THAN WHAT IS. IN THE GOALS FOR

00:19:20.926 --> 00:19:24.029
THE VISION OF SIX FOR SUCCESS.

00:19:24.096 --> 00:19:25.664
HAVE YOU TO ADDRESS THAT FIRST

00:19:25.731 --> 00:19:28.567
SENATOR LAYERED ONE ALL CALL

00:19:28.634 --> 00:19:31.336
ATTENTION TO IS AROUND THE GOAL

00:19:31.403 --> 00:19:33.338
4 DEGREES COMPLETION THE VISION

00:19:33.405 --> 00:19:36.608
FOR SUCCESS HAS GOAL OF A 20%

00:19:36.675 --> 00:19:39.912
INCREASE BY TWENTY TWENTY TO.

00:19:39.978 --> 00:19:42.681
THEIR VISION AND THE ROADMAP

00:19:42.748 --> 00:19:45.651
CALLS FOR A SIMILAR GOAL WITH AN

00:19:45.717 --> 00:19:47.686
EXTENDED TIMELINE WE THINK THAT

00:19:47.753 --> 00:19:49.388
IT'S STILL IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE

00:19:49.454 --> 00:19:51.356
TOWARDS THAT GOAL- AND THEN

00:19:51.423 --> 00:19:53.191
ADDED TIMELINE RECOGNIZES THE

00:19:53.258 --> 00:19:54.760
COMPLEXITIES STUDENTS IN

00:19:54.826 --> 00:19:57.963
COLLEGES HAVE FACED OVER THE

00:19:58.030 --> 00:19:59.665
LAST TWO YEARS. AND THEN MAYBE.

00:19:59.731 --> 00:20:02.968
I SHOULD FIND. SO DO YOU BELIEVE

00:20:03.035 --> 00:20:08.173
THAT- PROGRESS ON TH ROADMAP IS

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.475
SOMETHING THAT IS CONTINGENT ON

00:20:10.542 --> 00:20:12.578
FUTURE RECOMMENDATIONS WITH

00:20:12.644 --> 00:20:14.179
REGARD TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:20:14.246 --> 00:20:19.618
IN THE BUDGET. AND AS NOTED MY

00:20:19.685 --> 00:20:20.752
COLLEAGUE AT THAT THE

00:20:20.819 --> 00:20:22.721
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE- WE REALLY

00:20:22.788 --> 00:20:24.423
DO VIEW THE DIMINISH A RELIGIOUS

00:20:24.489 --> 00:20:25.824
VIEW OF THE ROAD MAP IS BEING

00:20:25.891 --> 00:20:27.025
COMPLIMENTARY AND BUILDING ON

00:20:27.092 --> 00:20:28.860
THE VISION FOR SUCCESS- I THINK

00:20:28.927 --> 00:20:29.661
IN IN LARGE PART THE

00:20:29.728 --> 00:20:30.896
ADMINISTRATION FEELS THAT THE

00:20:30.963 --> 00:20:31.964
COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE MOVING IN

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:33.765
THE RIGHT DIRECTION. WITH THE

00:20:33.832 --> 00:20:34.600
VISION FOR SUCCESS IN THIS IS

00:20:34.666 --> 00:20:36.768
REALLY DESIGNED TO SORT OF BUILD

00:20:36.835 --> 00:20:38.937
ON THAT PROGRESS AND SO I THINK

00:20:39.004 --> 00:20:40.973
THERE THERE ARE- DIFFERENT

00:20:41.039 --> 00:20:42.140
DIRECTIONS SUCH AS THINGS LIKE

00:20:42.207 --> 00:20:44.776
CONCOURSE NUMBERING IN AND- THAT

00:20:44.843 --> 00:20:46.511
THE COMMISSION WANTS TO CONTINUE

00:20:46.578 --> 00:20:48.714
PUSHING ON ONE HERE. LET ME

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:50.882
INTERRUPT FOR SECOND AND THE

00:20:50.949 --> 00:20:52.150
ALEJO'S IN LINE BUT LET ME

00:20:52.217 --> 00:20:54.353
FINISH THIS LINE OF QUESTIONING.

00:20:54.419 --> 00:20:56.388
WHAT I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IS

00:20:56.455 --> 00:21:01.126
THE UC AND CSU. COMPAQ'S MAKE.

00:21:01.193 --> 00:21:03.729
CAN GROWTH FUND. CONTINGENT ON

00:21:03.795 --> 00:21:06.298
MEETING. A WHAT'S HAPPENING IN

00:21:06.365 --> 00:21:08.133
THOSE CONTACTS AND I AM TRYING

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.702
TO STE ASK. IF THERE'S A SIMILAR

00:21:10.769 --> 00:21:13.405
PRINCIPLE AT PLAY HERE. THAT

00:21:13.472 --> 00:21:15.207
YOU'VE DONE A ROAD MAP YOU'VE

00:21:15.273 --> 00:21:17.209
LAID OUT THIS VERSION OF WHAT IS

00:21:17.275 --> 00:21:19.778
A COMPACT FOR THE OTHER TWO. IF

00:21:19.845 --> 00:21:21.647
THEY DON'T MAKE PROGRESS DOES

00:21:21.713 --> 00:21:23.081
THAT AFFECT WHAT YOU DO IN THE

00:21:23.148 --> 00:21:24.850
FUTURE HAVE YOU LINKED TO THE TO

00:21:24.916 --> 00:21:26.985
THE WAY THEY ARE LINKED IN UC

00:21:27.052 --> 00:21:30.055
AND CSU. REST OF MY- OF MY

00:21:30.122 --> 00:21:31.890

THE- AGAIN AS AS YOU PREVIOUSLY

00:21:34.593 --> 00:21:36.194
REFERENCED THE COMMUNICATORS ARE

FUNDED UNDERNEATH THE

PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:40.132

00:21:40.198 --> 00:21:42.934
LEVEL OF EXPECTED FUNDING-

00:21:43.001 --> 00:21:45.337
INCLUDED WITHIN THE CONTACT IS

00:21:45.404 --> 00:21:47.773

GOALS THE ADMINISTRATION WILL

CONTINUE TO MAKE. SURE TARGETED

00:21:54.046 --> 00:21:55.781

WITHIN PROP NINETY EIGHT YOU

00:22:33.985 --> 00:22:36.154

ROAD MAP SO THERE IS OVERLAP

00:22:58.009 --> 00:23:00.145
THERE ARE IN SOME CASES THE ROAD

00:23:00.212 --> 00:23:01.279
MAP GOES BEYOND THE VISIONS FOR

00:23:01.346 --> 00:23:04.583
SUCCESS FOR EXAMPLE. THERE IS A-

00:23:04.649 --> 00:23:05.684
CALL IN THE ROAD MAP FOR

00:23:05.751 --> 00:23:08.687

00:25:54.719 --> 00:25:56.922
WE'VE REACHED OUT TO ALL THE

SOMEBODY BENEFIT IN SOME STRANGE

00:26:40.732 --> 00:26:44.402
WAY BY NOT REPORTING THAT DATA.

AS WELL. OKAY L. A. O. AS HIS

00:27:00.986 --> 00:27:05.857
HAND. THE COMMITTEE MIGHT WANT

TO GET CLARIFICATION ON THE

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:11.029
CONSEQUENCES OF DISTRICTS NOT

00:27:11.096 --> 00:27:12.931
REPORTING A MOMENT BECAUSE

00:27:12.998 --> 00:27:15.734
DISTRICTS REPORT ENROLLMENT TO

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:17.769
THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE SO THAT

00:27:17.836 --> 00:27:19.004

00:27:21.873 --> 00:27:24.142
MONEY HOW MUCH GENERAL PURPOSE

00:27:24.209 --> 00:27:26.044
MONEY THAT DISTRICT IS ENTITLED

00:27:26.111 --> 00:27:27.779
TO SO IF THE DISTRICTS NOT

00:27:27.846 --> 00:27:31.683
REPORTING THAT INFORMATION. I'LL

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:32.817
LET THE LEGISLATURE COMMITTEE

00:27:32.884 --> 00:27:36.254

00:27:36.321 --> 00:27:38.356
GASES OFFICE THEN KNOW HOW MUCH

00:27:38.423 --> 00:27:41.559
TO GIVE THE DISTRICT IN FUNDING

00:27:41.626 --> 00:27:43.628
. AND WHETHER MAYBE MONEY SHOULD

00:27:43.695 --> 00:27:46.264
BE WITHHELD WON'T PROBLEM LET ME

INFORMATION LET ME JUST GO AHEAD

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:49.834
AND PUT THAT QUESTION TO THE

00:27:49.901 --> 00:27:53.038
COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT'S WHAT I

00:27:53.104 --> 00:27:55.407
WAS TRYING TO ASK IN A MORE. UP

00:27:55.473 --> 00:27:56.474
MANNER AND I THINK HE WAS JUST

00:27:56.541 --> 00:27:58.877
CLEAR SO. HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND

00:27:58.943 --> 00:28:02.347
TO THAT. YOU THINK THAT IT'S

00:28:02.414 --> 00:28:04.916
IMPORTANT TO HAVE- CONVERSATIONS

00:28:04.983 --> 00:28:07.185
ABOUT HOW WE HOLD ON DISTRICTS

00:28:07.252 --> 00:28:09.387
ACCOUNTABLE TO ENROLLMENT

00:28:09.454 --> 00:28:10.622
REPORTING ESPECIALLY IN TIMES

00:28:10.688 --> 00:28:14.059
LIKE THIS HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN

00:28:14.125 --> 00:28:15.093
CONVERSATIONS OF WHAT THAT COULD

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.395
LOOK LIKE- THAT ONE NOW THAT WAS

00:28:17.462 --> 00:28:20.365
AN OP TO CENSOR SAYS SO- GIVEN

00:28:20.432 --> 00:28:21.766
WHAT THE L. A. O. SAID THAT

00:28:21.833 --> 00:28:24.202
THERE SHOULD BE CONSEQUENCES.

00:28:24.269 --> 00:28:26.037
WAS THAT A VERY VAGUE.

00:28:26.104 --> 00:28:29.641
SUGGESTION THAT THERE MIGHT BE

00:28:29.707 --> 00:28:30.408
CONSEQUENCES. I MEAN THAT'S THE

00:28:30.475 --> 00:28:32.210
QUESTION IS SOMEBODY DOESN'T

00:28:32.277 --> 00:28:35.180
REPORT AND YOU'RE OBLIGATED TO

00:28:35.246 --> 00:28:38.049
RELEASE MONEY TO THEM. HOW IS

00:28:38.116 --> 00:28:39.851
THAT CONNECTED. I WANTED

00:28:39.918 --> 00:28:41.586
PROVIDED CLARIFICATION TO

00:28:41.653 --> 00:28:42.821
SOMETHING THAT THE L. A. O.

00:28:42.887 --> 00:28:45.723
SAID- WE HAVE TWO DISTINCT TYPES

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:46.758
OF RECORDING ONE THAT IS

00:28:46.825 --> 00:28:48.093
UTILIZED FOR OUR FINANCIAL

00:28:48.159 --> 00:28:50.695
SYSTEMS THE OTHER IS THAT THAT

00:28:50.762 --> 00:28:53.765
IS USED FOR- HEAD COUNT LIKE THE

00:28:53.832 --> 00:28:55.200
KIND THAT YOU HAVE. IN YOUR

00:28:55.266 --> 00:28:59.104
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS ALL REPORTING

00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:02.073
FOR FINANCIAL ELEMENTS HAS BEEN

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:04.008
SUBMITTED WE DO HAVE THOSE WHAT

00:29:04.075 --> 00:29:06.111
WE WHAT IS UNDER QUESTION RIGHT

00:29:06.177 --> 00:29:07.912
NOW IS ANY DATA THAT HELPS US

00:29:07.979 --> 00:29:09.981
UNDERSTAND WHAT SO ARE LOST IN

00:29:10.048 --> 00:29:12.784
HEAD COUNT- THE MOMENTUM IN

00:29:12.851 --> 00:29:14.786
WHICH STUDENTS WHAT TYPE OF

00:29:14.853 --> 00:29:16.855
STUDENTS ARE NOT RETURNING OR

00:29:16.921 --> 00:29:20.158
STOPPING OUT- ALL OF THAT IS

00:29:20.225 --> 00:29:21.960
ALSO IMPORTANT. BECAUSE IT HELPS

00:29:22.026 --> 00:29:24.295
US UNDERSTAND THE PROFILE OF WHO

00:29:24.362 --> 00:29:25.964
ARE COLLEGES ARE SERVING AND

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:27.999
THEIR WORKLOAD. OKAY THAT WASN'T

00:29:28.066 --> 00:29:32.003
CLEAR FROM YOUR EARLIER ANSWER.

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:33.605
AND NOW WE ARE. GET SOMEWHERE.

00:29:33.671 --> 00:29:36.007
OF THEN LET ME ASK ANOTHER

00:29:36.074 --> 00:29:40.211
QUESTION- BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN

00:29:40.278 --> 00:29:42.247
A SYSTEM AND I CAN'T REMEMBER I

00:29:42.313 --> 00:29:44.482
HAD IT WRITTEN DOWN I. CAN'T PUT

00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:47.051

THE SUBJECT BUT THAT EXPIRES ON

00:30:00.598 --> 00:30:03.768
JUNE THIRTIETH AS I UNDERSTAND.

WHEN THERE ARE FIRE EMERGENCIES

00:30:32.463 --> 00:30:34.599
EARTHQUAKE AND OTHER SUCH DURING

00:30:34.666 --> 00:30:35.567
THE PANDEMIC MADE THOSE

00:30:35.633 --> 00:30:38.536
AVAILABLE- FOR DOES IT NEEDED TO

00:30:38.603 --> 00:30:40.638
PREVENT ANY AMOUNT OF FINANCIAL

00:30:40.705 --> 00:30:43.675
LOSSES. AS A RESULT OF HEALTH

00:30:43.741 --> 00:30:48.246
CONCERNS- OUR GOAL- AND URGENCY

00:30:48.313 --> 00:30:50.215
FOR HAVING FINAL M. I. S. DATA

00:30:50.281 --> 00:30:51.883
SUBMITTED IS SO THAT WE CAN MAKE

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:54.052
THAT ANALYSIS OUR HOPE IS TO

00:30:54.118 --> 00:30:55.720
HAVE. THAT ANALYSIS AND A

00:30:55.787 --> 00:30:58.656
DECISION ON EMERGENCY CONDITION

00:30:58.723 --> 00:31:01.426
ALLOWANCES BY MARCH BUT IF YOU

00:31:01.492 --> 00:31:04.395
DO NOT DO ANOTHER YEAR OF

00:31:04.462 --> 00:31:07.232
EMERGENCY CONDITIONS ALLOWANCE.

00:31:07.298 --> 00:31:08.967
IT'S SORT OF KICKS IN THE

00:31:09.033 --> 00:31:11.603
ENROLLMENT CLIFF FOR WHAT HAS

00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:13.404
BEEN DECLINING ENROLLMENT TO THE

00:31:13.471 --> 00:31:17.942
PANDEMIC. OR OTHER THINGS IS

00:31:18.009 --> 00:31:19.644
THAT CORRECT. WE THE WAY THAT ON

00:31:19.711 --> 00:31:22.580
A FUNDING IS STRUCTURE AND THEN

00:31:22.647 --> 00:31:25.350
AND BASS T. START RICHARD UNIT.

00:31:25.416 --> 00:31:27.285
THEY HAVE A THREE YEAR AVERAGE

00:31:27.352 --> 00:31:30.221
SO IT'S REALLY A STEP DOWN- THAT

00:31:30.288 --> 00:31:32.023
THEY EMERGENCY CONDITIONS THAT

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:34.325
THEY'VE HAD FOR THE PAST FEW

00:31:34.392 --> 00:31:35.793
YEARS. TO ROLL INTO THAT THREE

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:38.997
YEAR AVERAGE TWO EIGHT IF THEY

00:31:39.063 --> 00:31:41.199
DO NOT GET EXTENDED WOULD ONLY A

00:31:41.266 --> 00:31:44.936
FACT ABOUT A THIRD OF THEIR

00:31:45.003 --> 00:31:46.004
AFTER E. S. AND WE WILL HAVE.

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:49.440
COMPLETE ANALYSIS BY NEXT MONTH

00:31:49.507 --> 00:31:53.444
. OKAY AND THEN THAT LEADS TO.

00:31:53.511 --> 00:31:56.114
OF A VERSION OF THAT QUESTION

00:31:56.180 --> 00:32:00.351
WHICH IS UNDER EVEN THE ROLLING

00:32:00.418 --> 00:32:01.953
THREE IN MANY WAYS THERE'S A

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:04.856
CLIFF AT THE END OF BECAUSE IT'S

00:32:04.922 --> 00:32:08.960
ROLLING IN THERE BENNETT DROPS-

00:32:09.027 --> 00:32:11.629
IS THERE SOME EXPECTATION THAT

00:32:11.696 --> 00:32:14.732
THERE'S GOING TO BE A TIME WHEN

00:32:14.799 --> 00:32:16.701
- IF IN ROMA DOESN'T COME BACK

00:32:16.768 --> 00:32:19.203
THAT OTHER COLLEGES ARE GOING TO

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:20.738
BE HIT. WITH A BIG PROBLEM

00:32:20.805 --> 00:32:22.640
BECAUSE OF FOR A DECLINING IN

00:32:22.707 --> 00:32:27.679
ROME. COLLEGES THAT DON'T

00:32:27.745 --> 00:32:29.180
RESTORE BELIEVE THEIR

00:32:29.247 --> 00:32:31.149
INVOLVEMENT THAT ALSO MEANS THAT

00:32:31.215 --> 00:32:33.451
THEY'RE SERVING FEWER STUDENTS-

00:32:33.518 --> 00:32:35.620
AND THEREFORE- EXTENDED

00:32:35.687 --> 00:32:36.954
PROTECTIONS MEANS THAT WE'RE

00:32:37.021 --> 00:32:39.957
FINDING- TAXPAYER RESOURCES FOR

00:32:40.024 --> 00:32:40.858
STUDENTS THAT ARE NOT BEING

00:32:40.925 --> 00:32:42.560
SERVED. SO THAT THOSE ARE THE

00:32:42.627 --> 00:32:45.296
TYPES OF- CONVERSATIONS WE WANT

00:32:45.363 --> 00:32:47.765
TO HAVE WITH THE LEGISLATURE THE

00:32:47.832 --> 00:32:49.500
ELIAN HELLO. AND THE DEPARTMENT

00:32:49.567 --> 00:32:52.470
OF FINANCE- ON HOW DO WE

00:32:52.537 --> 00:32:53.571
CONTINUE TO STRUCTURE AND

00:32:53.638 --> 00:32:54.972
SENTENCED TO SERVE ADDITIONAL

00:32:55.039 --> 00:32:57.075
STUDENTS- AND SERVE THEM WHILE

00:32:57.141 --> 00:32:58.910
DURING THIS TIME. AND JUST

00:32:58.976 --> 00:33:01.746
BEFORE I GO TO THE ALEJO WES IS

00:33:01.813 --> 00:33:05.917
HAND UP. OF LET ME. SAY THAT

00:33:05.983 --> 00:33:07.585
WHEN WE HAD OUR K. THROUGH

00:33:07.652 --> 00:33:11.756
TWELVE. HEARING ON ENROLLMENT.

00:33:11.823 --> 00:33:12.623
PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING. THERE

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:14.258
BEEN A WHOLE HARMLESS. AND THE

00:33:14.325 --> 00:33:16.694
GOVERNOR PROPOSED HOLDING

00:33:16.761 --> 00:33:19.230
HARMLESS ANOTHER YEAR. AND WHILE

00:33:19.297 --> 00:33:21.132
ALL THE DISTRICTS- CHEERING

00:33:21.199 --> 00:33:22.467
ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY'RE HELD

00:33:22.533 --> 00:33:25.002
HARMLESS THIS YEAR IT MEANS THAT

00:33:25.069 --> 00:33:27.739
THERE WILL BE A CLIFF AT THE END

00:33:27.805 --> 00:33:29.474
OF THAT AND THE QUESTION WAS.

00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:31.209
WHICH IS WHAT I WAS TRYING TO

00:33:31.275 --> 00:33:33.711
ASK HERE. IS WHETHER WE SHOULD

00:33:33.778 --> 00:33:35.646
START TO THINK ABOUT ADDRESSING

00:33:35.713 --> 00:33:39.350
THAT CLIFF NOW I'M- IF THERE'S A

00:33:39.417 --> 00:33:41.018
HOLD HARMLESS IN A ROLLING THING

00:33:41.085 --> 00:33:42.420
EVERYBODY WILL LOVE IT AND WE

00:33:42.487 --> 00:33:48.659
SHOULD DO IT BUT. SHINN'S NOW

00:33:48.726 --> 00:33:51.129
ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO CUSHION

00:33:51.195 --> 00:33:53.097
THAT RATHER THAN CHEST. COMING

00:33:53.164 --> 00:33:54.732
UP ON IT AND HAVE EVERYBODY SAY

00:33:54.799 --> 00:33:56.501
WHAT NOBODY SAW THIS COMING

00:33:56.567 --> 00:33:58.669
THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO DRIVE

00:33:58.736 --> 00:34:01.839
ACT. YEAH I BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE

00:34:01.906 --> 00:34:03.441
HIGHLIGHTING A REALLY IMPORTANT

00:34:03.508 --> 00:34:05.777
POINT ONE POINT TWO IS SOMETHING

00:34:05.843 --> 00:34:06.677
THAT IS IN YOUR COMMITTEE

00:34:06.744 --> 00:34:08.646
ANALYSIS THAT- IDENTIFIES OF

00:34:08.713 --> 00:34:11.215
THEIR OPTIONS FOR. CONSIDERING

00:34:11.282 --> 00:34:12.817
DEALING WITH THIS- RATHER THAN

00:34:12.884 --> 00:34:15.253
JUST SPENDING ON GROWTH THAT MAY

00:34:15.319 --> 00:34:17.555
NOT BE THERE AT COLLEGES. RATHER

00:34:17.622 --> 00:34:19.590
SHIFTING THE CONVERSATION TO THE

00:34:19.657 --> 00:34:22.193
OVERALL COST OF OPERATIONS OF.

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:24.162
EDUCATING STUDENTS THERE ARE FEW

00:34:24.228 --> 00:34:26.297
OPTIONS SUCH AS- INCREASING

00:34:26.364 --> 00:34:29.000
RATES UP SUCH AS THE BASIC-

00:34:29.067 --> 00:34:32.003
ALLOCATION- THAT- CAN BE

00:34:32.069 --> 00:34:33.171
CONSIDERED A COULD BE PART OF

00:34:33.237 --> 00:34:34.505
THE CONVERSATION THAT YOU'RE

00:38:30.241 --> 00:38:33.110
COMMITTEE SENATOR MEANT. THANK

00:38:33.177 --> 00:38:35.780
YOU CAN AMERICANS- SO I THINK

00:38:35.846 --> 00:38:36.981
CHAIR LAYERED COVERED A LOT OF

00:38:37.048 --> 00:38:39.183
GROUND OBVIOUSLY I DID HAVE A

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:42.219
QUESTION AND THEN I COMMENT. MY

00:38:42.286 --> 00:38:43.120
QUESTION RELATES TO A LOT OF

00:38:43.187 --> 00:38:46.757
THE- DIALOGUE THAT YOU HAD- JUST

00:38:46.824 --> 00:38:49.427
NOW. AROUND ENROLLMENT AND THE

00:38:49.493 --> 00:38:51.195
CAUSES OF IT- YEAH I APPRECIATE

00:38:51.262 --> 00:38:52.263
THE FACT THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET

00:38:52.329 --> 00:38:53.664
THE NEW ENROLLMENT NUMBERS AT

00:38:53.731 --> 00:38:56.300
THE END OF THIS MONTH- WE HAD A

00:38:56.367 --> 00:38:57.702
DISCUSSION WITH CSU WHICH I

00:38:57.768 --> 00:38:59.503
THINK IS. DIFFERENT BUT HAS SOME

00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:02.039
SIMILAR ASPECTS TO IT IS THE

00:39:02.106 --> 00:39:03.040
COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM HERE IN

00:39:03.107 --> 00:39:05.743
CALIFORNIA- IT WAS THE THINGS I

00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:07.178
FIND INTERESTING ABOUT

00:39:07.244 --> 00:39:08.345
ENROLLMENT RIGHT NOW IS THAT

00:39:08.412 --> 00:39:09.747
YOU'VE GOT MULTIPLE POTENTIAL

00:39:09.814 --> 00:39:11.682
CAUSES OF IT RIGHT- CERTAINLY

00:39:11.749 --> 00:39:13.517
COBIT NINETEEN BOTH TE HEALTH

00:39:13.584 --> 00:39:17.054
RELATED ASPECTS. AS WELL AS- THE

00:39:17.121 --> 00:39:19.323
REMOTE INSTRUCTION ARE PROBABLY

00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:21.158
FAXING HUGE FACTORS IN DECLINE

00:39:21.225 --> 00:39:22.893
ENROLLMENT WE'VE SEEN IT SEE

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:25.529
ISSUES AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES-

00:39:25.596 --> 00:39:27.098
AT THE SAME TIME THERE THERE MAY

00:39:27.164 --> 00:39:28.699
BE OTHER FACTORS CONTRIBUTING

00:39:28.766 --> 00:39:30.735
THAT IN AND CERTAINLY- YEAH I

00:39:30.801 --> 00:39:32.303
ASSUME THIS IS THE SAME FOR THE

00:39:32.369 --> 00:39:33.204
COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM CSU'S

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:35.673
TOLD ME. IN IN RESPONSE TO A

00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:37.274
QUESTION I HAD AT THEIR HEARING.

00:39:37.341 --> 00:39:39.343
THAT WHEN WE HAVE A STRONG

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:41.112
ECONOMY WITH HIGH WAGES AND LOTS

00:39:41.178 --> 00:39:44.215
OF JOBS WHAT WE TEND TO SEE IS-

00:39:44.281 --> 00:39:47.418
A LOT OF PEOPLE DECLINING TO GO

00:39:47.485 --> 00:39:49.820
TO COLLEGE- INSTEAD TAKING THAT

00:39:49.887 --> 00:39:51.922
OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO JOIN THE

00:39:51.989 --> 00:39:52.923
WORKFORCE FOR SOME PERIOD OF

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:54.425
TIME- AND GIVEN THE HIGH WAGES

00:39:54.492 --> 00:39:56.127
WE'RE SEEING NOW I WOULD IMAGINE

00:39:56.193 --> 00:39:58.162
THAT IS ALSO A CAUSE OF THE

00:39:58.229 --> 00:39:59.663
DECLINE IN ENROLLMENT- AND THEN

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:00.731
THERE'S ALSO THIS POTENTIAL

00:40:00.798 --> 00:40:02.266
STRUCTURAL FACTORS. HOW DO WE

00:40:02.333 --> 00:40:03.734
HAVE A CHANGING WORKFORCE TO

00:40:03.801 --> 00:40:04.802
HAVE CHANGING DEMOGRAPHIC

00:40:04.869 --> 00:40:06.604
TRENDS. THAT ARE CAUSING FEWER

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:08.172
PEOPLE TO MAYBE WANT TO GO TO

00:40:08.239 --> 00:40:10.441
COMMUNITY COLLEGE. AND SO MY

00:40:10.508 --> 00:40:12.476
QUESTION IS THIS- MAY MAYBE

00:40:12.543 --> 00:40:13.611
SMARTLY START AND MAKE THIS A

00:40:13.677 --> 00:40:14.979
TWO PARTER FOR DEPARTMENT OF

00:40:15.045 --> 00:40:17.448
FINANCE AND ALEJO- DO YOU THINK

00:40:17.515 --> 00:40:19.049
IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF WE HAD

00:40:19.116 --> 00:40:20.718
SOME KIND OF DATA. ON WHY

00:40:20.785 --> 00:40:21.852
STUDENTS ARE NOT GOING TO

00:40:21.919 --> 00:40:22.887
COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR WHY THEY'RE

00:40:22.953 --> 00:40:23.988
CHOOSING TO GO TO COMMUNITY

00:40:24.054 --> 00:40:25.856
COLLEGE. AS WE KIND OF COME UP

00:40:25.923 --> 00:40:27.324
WITH THE NUMBERS. AS WE THINK

00:40:27.391 --> 00:40:29.160
ABOUT BUDGET ALLOCATIONS NOT

00:40:29.226 --> 00:40:30.594
JUST THIS YEAR BUT OVER THE NEXT

00:40:30.661 --> 00:40:32.263
FEW YEARS. OUR AND IN ROMAN

00:40:32.329 --> 00:40:36.867
TARGETS. WELL I CAN ANSWER FIRST

00:40:36.934 --> 00:40:40.738
IF THAT'S HELPFUL- I'D SAY-

00:40:40.805 --> 00:40:42.573
CENTER TO YOUR QUESTION- AND

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:44.909
ALSO TO THE POINT YOU MADE YES.

00:40:44.975 --> 00:40:46.143
THE CAUSE OF THIS ARE

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:47.511
POTENTIALLY. MYRIAD AND THERE

00:40:47.578 --> 00:40:49.547
ARE DEFINITELY- A LOT OF

00:40:49.613 --> 00:40:51.048
POTENTIAL REASONS WHY COMMUNITY

00:40:51.115 --> 00:40:51.882
WIDE ENROLLMENT HAS BEEN

00:40:51.949 --> 00:40:53.651
DECLINING. OVER THE PAST TWO

00:40:53.717 --> 00:40:55.452
YEARS. I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT WE

00:40:55.519 --> 00:40:57.254
ARE SEEING THESE ENROLLMENT

00:40:57.321 --> 00:40:58.689
TRENDS NATIONWIDE SO THIS IS NOT

00:40:58.756 --> 00:41:00.191
SOMETHING. AS WELL THAT SPECIFIC

00:41:00.257 --> 00:41:01.458
TO CALIFORNIA OR TO OUR

00:41:01.525 --> 00:41:03.694
COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM BUT- IS

00:41:03.761 --> 00:41:04.328
ALREADY SOMETHING ARCING ACROSS

00:41:04.395 --> 00:41:07.298
THE SYSTEM- I THINK I THINK OF

00:41:07.364 --> 00:41:08.465
COURSE IT IS. IS ABSOLUTELY

00:41:08.532 --> 00:41:10.034
HELPFUL IN HELPING US TO TAKE

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:11.502
CONSIDERED POTENTIAL DECISIONS

00:41:11.569 --> 00:41:12.436
AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE GOING TO

00:41:12.503 --> 00:41:14.672
CONTINUE TO. HAVE CONVERSATIONS-

00:41:14.738 --> 00:41:16.173
AS WE AS WE MOVE TOWARDS THE

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:17.541
MAYOR VISION AND INTO THE NEXT

00:41:17.608 --> 00:41:19.376
TWO BUDGET YEARS. I'M RELATED TO

00:41:19.443 --> 00:41:20.911
ENROLLMENT AND WHAT. OUR

00:41:20.978 --> 00:41:24.081
STUDENTS ARE. HANDLING THIS BUT-

00:41:24.148 --> 00:41:26.717
YEAH AND AGAIN IT IT. OUR

00:41:26.784 --> 00:41:27.484
EXPECTATION IS THAT THERE ARE

00:41:27.551 --> 00:41:29.720
GOING TO BE PRETTY- DIFFERENT

00:41:29.787 --> 00:41:31.322
REASONS FOR VERY DIVERSE STUDENT

00:41:31.388 --> 00:41:32.690
POPULATION SURE BUT BUT NOT

00:41:32.756 --> 00:41:33.891
UNDERSTANDING THOSE REASONS I

00:41:33.958 --> 00:41:35.726
GUESS WOULD BE. VERY HELPFUL IN

00:41:35.793 --> 00:41:36.760
DETERMINING WHAT ENROLLMENT

00:41:36.827 --> 00:41:37.928
TARGETS BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW

00:41:37.995 --> 00:41:39.096
WHAT. THAT THERE SOME OF THESE-

00:41:39.163 --> 00:41:42.533
pBE MORE PERMANENT STRUCTURAL I

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:43.534
GUESS THAT THAT'S A REALLY WHAT

00:41:43.601 --> 00:41:48.172
I'M GETTING AT. I L. A- DO YOU

00:41:48.239 --> 00:41:50.541
HAVE ANY THOUGHTS HERE. YEAH WE

00:41:50.608 --> 00:41:51.208
WOULD AGREE- HAVING BETTER IN.

00:41:51.275 --> 00:41:55.713
ABOUT THE REASONS WOULD BE-

00:41:55.779 --> 00:41:58.382
USEFUL FOR THE LEGISLATURE OF

00:41:58.449 --> 00:42:00.351
THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IS DONE

00:42:00.417 --> 00:42:02.620
SOME WORK IN THIS AREA YEAH IN

00:42:02.686 --> 00:42:03.254
THE FALL THE CHANCELLOR'S

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:08.659
OFFICE- SURVEYED ABOUT FOUR

00:42:08.726 --> 00:42:10.895
HUNDRED. RESPECTIVE STUDENTS OR

00:42:10.961 --> 00:42:12.329
ADULTS WHO OTHERWISE MIGHT HAVE

00:42:12.396 --> 00:42:14.231
GONE TO COLLEGE AND WHAT THEY

00:42:14.298 --> 00:42:17.468
HEARD BACK WAS THAT THEY NEED TO

00:42:17.534 --> 00:42:21.038
WORK FULL TIME WAS SEEN AS IS

00:42:21.105 --> 00:42:22.573
ONE OF THE MAJOR BARRIER THE

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.575
MAJOR BARRIER FOR ENROLLING IN

00:42:24.642 --> 00:42:26.911
THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGES AS YOU

00:42:26.977 --> 00:42:29.747
MENTIONED SENATOR MAN. AS A AS A

00:42:29.813 --> 00:42:32.316
POSSIBILITY SO THAT'S- THAT'S

00:42:32.383 --> 00:42:34.218
SOMETHING THAT- SOME DATA POINT

00:42:34.285 --> 00:42:37.321
THAT THAT WE HAVE YEAH AND ALSO-

00:42:37.388 --> 00:42:38.489
STUDENTS ARE PROSPECTIVE

00:42:38.555 --> 00:42:39.957
STUDENTS THAT HAVE FAMILY

00:42:40.024 --> 00:42:41.725
OBLIGATIONS THEY NEED TO STAY IN

00:42:41.792 --> 00:42:43.928
WITH A CHANCE CAL CARES BECOME

00:42:43.994 --> 00:42:46.330
DIFFICULT THERE'S OTHER ISSUES

00:42:46.397 --> 00:42:48.899
SO THAT'S ABSOLUTELY- TRUE BUT

00:42:48.966 --> 00:42:51.068
HAVING HAVING EVEN MORE

00:42:51.135 --> 00:42:52.536
INFORMATION BETTER INFORMATION

00:42:52.603 --> 00:42:54.838
OR DISTRICT LEVEL INFORMATION

00:42:54.905 --> 00:42:55.940
WHICH WOULD ACTUALLY BE MORE

00:42:56.006 --> 00:42:57.641
USEFUL THAN THAN WHAT WE HAVE

00:42:57.708 --> 00:42:59.310
NOW. AND OF COURSE HERE MA'AM IS

00:42:59.376 --> 00:43:00.577
NEVER AND I WANT TO GO TO YOU

00:43:00.644 --> 00:43:02.379
AND ASK THAT YOU KNOW MAYBE YOU

00:43:02.446 --> 00:43:04.014
CAN ELABORATE ON THE SURVEY THAT

00:43:04.081 --> 00:43:06.283
MR SEEN HOUSING WAS REFERRING TO

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:08.018
AND DO YOU HAVE PLANS TO TRY TO

00:43:08.085 --> 00:43:09.753
DIG DEEPER BECAUSE TO ME THIS.

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:11.088
YEAH YOU KNOW BEFORE WE YOU KNOW

00:43:11.155 --> 00:43:12.356
DECIDE WHAT WE'RE BASICALLY

00:43:12.423 --> 00:43:14.425
SHOOTING BLIND HERE AND IF WE

00:43:14.491 --> 00:43:15.859
HAVE MORE DATA I SUSPECT I'LL BE

00:43:15.926 --> 00:43:17.861
INCREDIBLY HELPFUL AS WE

00:43:17.928 --> 00:43:19.663
DETERMINE WHAT'S APPROPRIATE YOU

00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:21.332
KNOW MAYBE WE WILL SEE AN IRONIC

00:43:21.398 --> 00:43:22.466
LAUGH MAYBE THAT'S JUST ON

00:43:22.533 --> 00:43:24.068
AVOIDABLE MAYBE CALL AT THE IN

00:43:24.134 --> 00:43:26.303
THE CALL BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA SEE

00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:27.237
IS BIG A DIFFERENCE WE THOUGHT.

00:43:27.304 --> 00:43:28.439
AYE I SITTING HERE I HAVE NO

00:43:28.505 --> 00:43:30.374
SENSE OF WHAT IN ROOM IT'S GONNA

00:43:30.441 --> 00:43:32.142
LOOK LIKE R. N. AND I WOULD

00:43:32.209 --> 00:43:33.577
ASSUME YOU GUYS IN A BETTER

00:43:33.644 --> 00:43:35.245
POSITION SO I GUESS THE QUESTION

00:43:35.312 --> 00:43:36.280
HERE IS HAVE YOU DONE ANY YOU

00:43:36.347 --> 00:43:37.581
CAN YOU CAN YOU ELABORATE A ANY

00:43:37.648 --> 00:43:39.550
RESEARCH THAT YOU'VE DONE. AND

00:43:39.616 --> 00:43:40.751
DO YOU HAVE PLANS TO DO ANY

00:43:40.818 --> 00:43:47.358
FURTHER DEEPER. RESEARCH AND IF

00:43:47.424 --> 00:43:49.660
NOT WHY NOT. YOU SEE MAN. OF ONE

00:43:49.727 --> 00:43:54.965
OF. AND THE- SEARCH. THAT THE L.

00:43:55.032 --> 00:43:57.701
A. L. SO WE DID- SURVEYED

00:43:57.768 --> 00:43:58.602
RESPECT STUDENTS WE ALSO HAVE

00:43:58.669 --> 00:44:00.771
PART. WHERE THEIR RESEARCH PLANE

00:44:00.838 --> 00:44:02.940
GROUP TO UNDER. WHAT'S WHAT WE

00:44:03.007 --> 00:44:04.141
ARE HEARING FROM STUDENTS IS

00:44:04.208 --> 00:44:07.277
THAT. THEY ARE SEEKING IN ASKING

00:44:07.344 --> 00:44:08.846
FOR GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN OUR

00:44:08.912 --> 00:44:10.748
COURSES AND HYBRID. MUCH OF THIS

00:44:10.814 --> 00:44:13.117
AGAIN RELATED TO THE NEED TO

00:44:13.183 --> 00:44:16.253
WORK FOR NECESSITY AND WITH 61%

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.255
OF OUR STUDENTS AGAIN. WORKING A

00:44:18.322 --> 00:44:20.557
SOLE PROVIDERS- AND FOR THEIR

00:44:20.624 --> 00:44:24.328
FAMILIES. AND SO. DYNAMIC OF-

00:44:24.395 --> 00:44:26.597
BEING ABLE TO. RE ENTER THE

00:44:26.663 --> 00:44:28.332
WORKFORCE AND HIGHER WAGE

00:44:28.399 --> 00:44:29.533
SPECIALLY FOR THOSE THAT MAY

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:31.802
HAVE LOST INCOME. DURING THE

00:44:31.869 --> 00:44:33.670
PANDEMIC IS VERY APPEALING

00:44:33.737 --> 00:44:34.738
ESPECIALLY FOR LOW INCOME

00:44:34.805 --> 00:44:36.940
STUDENTS. WE ARE SEEING SOME

00:44:37.007 --> 00:44:39.510
ENROLLMENT GAINS IN SOME AREAS

00:44:39.576 --> 00:44:42.046
OF STATE ALL HIGHLIGHT ON THE-

00:44:42.112 --> 00:44:44.481
H. SANTIAGO IS HAD- WHENEVER

00:44:44.548 --> 00:44:50.387
DISTRICTS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. HAS HAD SOME GAMES. THE LOOK

00:44:50.454 --> 00:44:52.289
THE SECOND PIECE OF YOUR OF WHAT

00:44:52.356 --> 00:44:53.557
DO WE OTHER. WE DO HAVE

00:44:53.624 --> 00:44:55.626
CONTINUED TO SERVE FOLLOWINGS

00:44:55.692 --> 00:44:57.995
CENSUS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS

00:44:58.062 --> 00:44:59.730
ALSO RELEASING GRANT

00:44:59.797 --> 00:45:01.298
OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO RESEARCH

00:45:01.365 --> 00:45:03.100
THIS PHENOMENON THAT'S HAPPENING

00:45:03.167 --> 00:45:05.569
NATIONWIDE WE WILL BE PARTNERING

00:45:05.636 --> 00:45:08.305
WITH TO- RESEARCH ENTITIES. TO

00:45:08.372 --> 00:45:10.507
HELP US BRING CAPACITY TO BETTER

00:45:10.574 --> 00:45:12.910
UNDERSTAND THIS ISSUE I'M SO WE

00:45:12.976 --> 00:45:15.612
ARE VERY INTERESTED ON WE WANT

00:45:15.679 --> 00:45:17.448
TO BRING BACK STUDENTS BUT WE

00:45:17.514 --> 00:45:19.083
ALSO WANT TO ENSURE THAT OUR

00:45:19.149 --> 00:45:19.683
COLLEGES ARE NOT LOSING

00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:21.452
RESOURCES AS A RESULT OF THESE

00:45:21.518 --> 00:45:24.354
DECLINES YEAH- AND SO I GUESS

00:45:24.421 --> 00:45:27.224
I'LL CHANGE MY SECOND COMMENT.

00:45:27.291 --> 00:45:29.726
THE CRITICAL QUESTION- SO. I'M

AND OBVIOUSLY THIS IS GONNA BE

00:46:05.762 --> 00:46:06.363
DIFFERENT DISTRICT BY DISTRICT

00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:09.199
BASIS BUT- MOVING FORWARD. HOW

00:46:09.266 --> 00:46:10.968
MUCH ONLINE VERSUS IN PERSON

00:46:11.034 --> 00:46:13.370

00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:28.919
DIFFERENT. DEPENDING ON- THAT

00:46:28.986 --> 00:46:32.189
PROGRAM OF STUDY. MANY OF OUR-

00:46:32.256 --> 00:46:34.258

. INSTRUCTION IS PROVIDED REALLY

00:46:44.501 --> 00:46:48.805
IS IN THAT IN PERSON- AS PART OF

00:46:48.872 --> 00:46:50.207
ON SOME OF THESE ANALYSIS WE

00:46:50.274 --> 00:46:53.243
HEARD THAT- AROUND 27% OF

00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:55.946
STUDENTS PREFERRED- FULLY

00:46:56.013 --> 00:46:58.749
ONLINE. OTHERS WANTED A BLANK

00:46:58.815 --> 00:47:00.784
TODAY WHAT WHAT WE'VE HEARD ALSO

00:47:00.851 --> 00:47:02.953
WAS A BIG ONE IN PERSON STUDENTS

00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:05.923

IS JUST A DYNAMIC SHIFT IN HOW

00:47:17.167 --> 00:47:19.937
STUDENTS. WANT THEIR EDUCATION

00:47:20.003 --> 00:47:21.405

LAYERED AYE AYE AYE. I STILL AM

00:47:39.623 --> 00:47:41.959
NOT CLEAR ON ON WHAT THE RIGHT

00:47:42.025 --> 00:47:43.560
ENROLLMENT STRATEGY IS AND I

00:47:43.627 --> 00:47:44.761
KNOW WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT THIS

00:47:44.828 --> 00:47:46.897

ADDED TO REFER TO MY EARLIER

00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:54.438
COMMENT WHAT WORK WE'RE SHOOTING

00:47:54.504 --> 00:47:56.039
DARTS. WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT

00:47:56.106 --> 00:47:57.207
DIRECTION WE'RE SUPPOSED TO

00:47:57.274 --> 00:47:59.977
THROW THEM IN AT THIS POINT

00:48:00.043 --> 00:48:00.978
BECAUSE- THERE'S JUST SUCH A-

00:48:01.044 --> 00:48:03.680
I'M A MIX A MYRIAD OF FACTORS AS

00:48:03.747 --> 00:48:04.348
WE SAID. ON WHAT COULD BE

00:48:04.414 --> 00:48:05.816
CAUSING THIS AND ROMAN DECLINE

00:48:05.882 --> 00:48:07.317
IS VERY HARD FOR ME SITTING

00:48:07.384 --> 00:48:10.087
HERE. TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT THE

00:48:10.153 --> 00:48:11.755
RIGHT ENROLLMENT STRATEGIES ARE

GONNA BE GOING FORWARD BECAUSE

00:48:12.589 --> 00:48:14.458
IT IT DOES STRIKE ME THAT THAT

00:48:14.524 --> 00:48:16.994
WE MAY BE SEEING. A DECLINE OVER

00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:18.362
THE LONG RUN IN ENROLLMENT IN

00:48:18.428 --> 00:48:19.363
OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND

00:48:19.429 --> 00:48:20.964
THAT'S SOMETHING WE MAY HAVE TO

00:48:21.031 --> 00:48:22.332
THINK ABOUT ADDRESSING. AND

00:48:22.399 --> 00:48:23.634
IDEALLY PROACTIVELY RATHER THAN

00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:25.602
RETROACTIVELY BUT- MAYBE I'M

00:48:25.669 --> 00:48:28.138
WRONG BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE

00:48:28.205 --> 00:48:29.840
HELPFUL HERE. THANK YOU CENTER

ONE SO I'LL FOCUS ON THE COST OF

00:49:58.328 --> 00:50:01.164
LIVING ADJUSTMENT PROPOSAL AS

00:50:01.231 --> 00:50:03.133
YOUR AGENDA NOTES THE COST OF

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:06.203
LIVING ADJUSTMENT RATE FOR

00:50:06.269 --> 00:50:07.170
TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE IS LIKELY

00:50:07.237 --> 00:50:09.373
TO BE HIGHER. THAN WHAT THE

00:50:09.439 --> 00:50:11.942
GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING- THE FIVE

00:50:12.008 --> 00:50:14.411
POINT 33% OUR OFFICE ESTIMATES

00:50:14.478 --> 00:50:16.546
THAT THE CALL RATE IS GOING TO

00:50:16.613 --> 00:50:20.951
BE MORE LIKE SIX POINT 2% OF FOR

00:50:21.017 --> 00:50:22.853
NEXT YEAR I WHICH WOULD COST

00:50:22.919 --> 00:50:24.488
ABOUT SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS

00:50:24.554 --> 00:50:26.890
MORE THAN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

00:50:26.957 --> 00:50:29.126
IS PROPOSING. THAT DISTRICTS ARE

00:50:29.192 --> 00:50:30.494
FACING A NUMBER OF COST

00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:33.163
PRESSURES IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY

00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:33.797
THREE FIRST YOU HAVE EMPLOYEES

00:50:33.864 --> 00:50:35.499
THEIR OWN COST OF LIVING HAS

00:50:35.565 --> 00:50:37.734
GONE UP SO THERE IS PRESSURE ON

00:50:37.801 --> 00:50:39.736
DISTRICTS PROVIDE SALARY

00:50:39.803 --> 00:50:42.506
INCREASES FOR EMPLOYEES

00:50:42.572 --> 00:50:45.776
DISTRICTS ALSO HAVE. REQUIRED

CONTRIBUTIONS TO CALPERS AND CAL

00:50:48.278 --> 00:50:50.914
STARS AND THAT AMOUNT IS GOING

00:50:50.981 --> 00:50:53.183
TO GO UP IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY

00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:54.818
THREE BY ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY

00:50:54.885 --> 00:50:56.319
MILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL AND

00:50:56.386 --> 00:50:58.321
DISTRICTS ARE ALSO FACING COST

00:50:58.388 --> 00:51:01.057

00:51:05.462 --> 00:51:08.098
REALIZING SOME SAVINGS AND THE

00:51:08.165 --> 00:51:09.766
CURRENT YEAR BECAUSE THEY DON'T

00:51:09.833 --> 00:51:11.601
NEED AS MANY PART IME FACULTY I

00:51:11.668 --> 00:51:14.738
DO TO LOWER. COURSE DEMANDS AND

00:51:14.805 --> 00:51:17.307
IF THAT TREND CONTINUES NEXT

00:51:17.374 --> 00:51:18.809
YEAR DISTRICTS WILL CONTINUE TO

00:51:18.875 --> 00:51:20.610
SEE SAVINGS BUT THAT SAVINGS

00:51:20.677 --> 00:51:22.112
LIKELY WILL NOT BE ENOUGH TO

00:51:22.179 --> 00:51:24.681
OFFSET THE UPWARD PRESSURE ON

00:51:24.748 --> 00:51:27.651

I JUST MENTIONED SO WE RECOMMEND

00:51:29.619 --> 00:51:31.154

00:51:31.221 --> 00:51:33.023
ON A COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT

00:51:33.089 --> 00:51:34.791

BY. MAY ON WHAT THAT REFRACT RAY

00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:52.976
IT WILL BE- LOOKING IS WELL AS

00:51:53.043 --> 00:51:54.444

TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX.

00:57:02.919 --> 00:57:04.554
OBJECTIVELY THIS APPROACH ALLOWS

00:57:04.621 --> 00:57:06.222
DISTRICTS TO TRANSITION TO THE

00:57:06.289 --> 00:57:07.891
CORE FUNDING FORMULA OVER TIME.

00:57:07.957 --> 00:57:08.892

WILL MOVE TO THE LA AREA. STILL

00:57:38.087 --> 00:57:41.224
IN ISSUE ONE. WE ARE THIS THIS

00:57:41.291 --> 00:57:42.625
COMMITTEE HEARD THE DISCUSSION

00:57:42.692 --> 00:57:45.995
ABOUT. ABOUT FORTY DISTRICTS

00:57:46.062 --> 00:57:49.499
THAT ARE KIND OF PROPPED UP WITH

00:57:49.566 --> 00:57:51.167
THEIR FUNDING DURING THE

00:57:51.234 --> 00:57:52.669
PANDEMIC BECAUSE OF EMERGENCY

00:57:52.735 --> 00:57:54.037
CONDITIONS ALLOWANCE WELL

00:57:54.103 --> 00:57:55.772
THERE'S ANOTHER GROUP OF

00:57:55.839 --> 00:57:58.341
DISTRICTS ABOUT TWENTY DISTRICTS

00:57:58.408 --> 00:58:00.910
THAT RECEIVE FUNDING UNDER A

00:58:00.977 --> 00:58:02.512
HOLD HARMLESS PROVISION IN THIS

00:58:02.579 --> 00:58:04.180
IS A PROVISION THAT WAS ENACTED

00:58:04.247 --> 00:58:06.583
WHEN THE STATE MOVED TO THE NEW

00:58:06.649 --> 00:58:10.086
FUNDING FORMULA IN TWO THOUSAND

00:58:10.153 --> 00:58:10.753
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND THAT MONEY

00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:12.755
IS WAS WAS INTENDED FOR THOSE

00:58:12.822 --> 00:58:15.191
DISTRICTS THAT. GOTTEN THE WOULD

00:58:15.258 --> 00:58:16.826
HAVE GENERATED LESS UNDER THE

00:58:16.893 --> 00:58:18.461
NEW FORMULA FORMULA IN THE OLD

00:58:18.528 --> 00:58:20.396
FUNDING FORMULA SO DISTRICTS

00:58:20.463 --> 00:58:22.532
LIKE REAL COLLEGE WHICH CHAIR

00:58:22.599 --> 00:58:24.300
GERMAN LEARN I KNOW YOU KNOW- A

00:58:24.367 --> 00:58:26.569
GREAT DEAL ABOUT SO THE

00:58:26.636 --> 00:58:28.671
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL HERE IS

00:58:28.738 --> 00:58:31.507
INTENDED TO PREVENT- MANY

00:58:31.574 --> 00:58:33.243
DISTRICTS THOSE HOLD HARMLESS

00:58:33.309 --> 00:58:34.611
DISTRICTS FROM HITTING A FISCAL

00:58:34.677 --> 00:58:36.546
CLIFF IN A FEW YEARS WHEN THE

00:58:36.613 --> 00:58:38.848
STATE'S CURRENT HOLD HARMLESS

00:58:38.915 --> 00:58:40.984
PROVISION IS SCHEDULED TO END.

00:58:41.050 --> 00:58:42.485
AND DISTRICTS ARE FUNDED BASED

00:58:42.552 --> 00:58:44.954
ON WHAT THEY GENERATE THROUGH

00:58:45.021 --> 00:58:45.521
THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING

00:58:45.588 --> 00:58:48.658
FORMULA SO INSTEAD OF HAVING TO

00:58:48.725 --> 00:58:50.426
SIGNIFICANTLY CUT THEIR BUDGETS

00:58:50.493 --> 00:58:54.664
BY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX UNDER

00:58:54.731 --> 00:58:55.331
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OF THOSE

00:58:55.398 --> 00:58:57.033
DISTRICTS APPORTIONMENT FUNDING

00:58:57.100 --> 00:59:00.036
AMOUNT WOULD BE CAPPED AT THEIR

00:59:00.103 --> 00:59:01.037
TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE LEVEL.

00:59:01.104 --> 00:59:03.106
NOW BECAUSE UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S

00:59:03.172 --> 00:59:04.574
BUDGET THE WHOLE TOM HARMLESS

00:59:04.641 --> 00:59:06.643
FUNNY LEVEL WOULD NOT RECEIVE

00:59:06.709 --> 00:59:08.478
ANY SUBSEQUENT COST OF LIVING

00:59:08.544 --> 00:59:11.781
ADJUSTMENTS BUT THE RATES UNDER

00:59:11.848 --> 00:59:13.116
THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING

00:59:13.182 --> 00:59:15.351
FORMULA WOULD RECEIVE COST OF

00:59:15.418 --> 00:59:16.920
LIVING ADJUSTMENTS THE INTENSE

00:59:16.986 --> 00:59:18.221
BY THE GOVERNOR IS THAT OVER

00:59:18.288 --> 00:59:19.989
TIME THIS STUDENT CENTERED

00:59:20.056 --> 00:59:21.457
FUNDING FORMULA WOULD GENERATE

00:59:21.524 --> 00:59:23.559
MORE MONEY FOR THOSE DISTRICTS

00:59:23.626 --> 00:59:24.594
THE SO CALLED HOLD HARMLESS

00:59:24.661 --> 00:59:30.033
DISTRICTS SUCH SAID EVENTUALLY.

00:59:30.099 --> 00:59:31.367
THERE ARE- THEY WOULD BE RISK

00:59:31.434 --> 00:59:33.469
MORE MONEY UNDER AS THAT THEM

00:59:33.536 --> 00:59:34.070
HOLD HARMLESS AMOUNT AND THEY

00:59:34.137 --> 00:59:35.939
WOULD BE ON THE FORMULA FINALLY

00:59:36.005 --> 00:59:39.108
SO TO SPEAK. SO WE THINK THE

00:59:39.175 --> 00:59:42.111
GOVERNOR'S GOAL OF PREVENTING A

00:59:42.178 --> 00:59:44.480
FISCAL CLIFF IS LAUDABLE. AT THE

00:59:44.547 --> 00:59:47.216
SAME TIME BEING A DISTRICT THAT

00:59:47.283 --> 00:59:49.185
RECEIVES HOLD HARMLESS FUNDING

00:59:49.252 --> 00:59:51.120
MEANS THAT THEY'RE RECEIVING

00:59:51.187 --> 00:59:53.623
MONEY FROM THE STATE REGARDLESS

00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:55.525
OF HOW MANY STUDENTS THEY SERVE

00:59:55.591 --> 00:59:57.360
THE TYPE OF STUDENTS THEY SERVE.

00:59:57.427 --> 00:59:59.862
OR THE OUTCOME OF THOSE STUDENTS

00:59:59.929 --> 01:00:03.232
AS SUCH. BEING FUNDED ON HOLD

01:00:03.299 --> 01:00:05.134
HARMLESS GETTING MONEY. NO

01:00:05.201 --> 01:00:07.437
MATTER WHAT BASED ON MONEY THAT

01:00:07.503 --> 01:00:09.539
THEY GOT IN THE IN THE PRIOR

01:00:09.605 --> 01:00:11.808
FORMULA. IT DOES CREATE POOR

01:00:11.874 --> 01:00:13.476
INCENTIVES FOR DISTRICTS AND THE

01:00:13.543 --> 01:00:15.445
STATE REALLY SHOULD STRIVE TO

01:00:15.511 --> 01:00:17.814
GET DISTRICTS OFF HOLD HARMLESS

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:19.682
AND FUNDED BY THE FORMULA. AS

01:00:19.749 --> 01:00:22.585
SOON AS POSSIBLE. ONE WAY TO DO

01:00:22.652 --> 01:00:25.688
THAT IS TO INCREASE THE VALUE OF

01:00:25.755 --> 01:00:27.991
THE CURRENT OF PORTION OF

01:00:28.057 --> 01:00:29.525
FUNDING FORMULA. YOU COULD DO

01:00:29.592 --> 01:00:31.961
THAT BY INCREASING THE BASE

01:00:32.028 --> 01:00:33.429
PROVIDING MORE FUNDING FOR THE

01:00:33.496 --> 01:00:34.797
BASIN THIS NUMBER MENTIONED

01:00:34.864 --> 01:00:37.400
THAT. EARLIER YOU COULD INCREASE

01:00:37.467 --> 01:00:39.702
IT BEYOND THE COST OF LIVING

01:00:39.769 --> 01:00:40.603
ADJUSTMENTS THAT WAS SO WE

STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING

01:00:54.751 --> 01:00:55.785
FORMULA. THE LEGISLATURE COULD

01:00:55.852 --> 01:00:57.687
SET A TARGET LEVEL OF BASE

WANT TO MENTION THAT THAT THAT'S

01:06:36.792 --> 01:06:38.928

WAS TRYING TO GET AT ALSO IS

01:07:18.467 --> 01:07:21.103
THAT WALLETS TWENTY DISTRICTS IN

01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:23.539
UNDER 20% OF THE TOTAL DISTRICTS

01:07:23.606 --> 01:07:25.307
IT WAS MY SUSPICION IT'S A MUCH

01:07:25.374 --> 01:07:26.909
HIGHER NUMBER OF THE TOTAL

01:07:26.976 --> 01:07:29.512
STUDENT BODY. OF THE STATE

01:07:29.578 --> 01:07:31.180
BECAUSE OF THE LARGE DISTRICTS

01:07:31.247 --> 01:07:33.916
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I WAS

01:07:33.983 --> 01:07:39.555
DRIVING. AND UNFORTUNATELY. A

01:07:39.622 --> 01:07:40.623
MOST OF THE COMMUNITY KERR TO IN

01:07:40.689 --> 01:07:42.591
MY DISTRICT IN COURT HARMLESS

01:07:42.658 --> 01:07:44.293
AND I AM INTIMATE FAMILIAR WITH

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:45.961
THEIR VIEWS ON THE MATTER AND- I

01:07:46.028 --> 01:07:48.197
SUSPECT WOULD. WHEN THE

01:07:48.264 --> 01:07:49.465
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SAID IN

01:07:49.532 --> 01:07:50.733
THE OPENING STATEMENT THAT THE

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:53.002
FORMULA REMAINS RESILIENT THEY

01:07:53.068 --> 01:07:54.203
HAVE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

01:07:54.270 --> 01:07:56.539
DEFINITION OF WHAT RESILIENCE

01:07:56.605 --> 01:07:57.072
MEANS IN RELATION TO THE

01:07:57.139 --> 01:08:01.944
FORMULA. SO THE- V. A. N. IT'S

01:08:02.011 --> 01:08:03.379
INTERESTING BECAUSE THE

01:08:03.446 --> 01:08:05.948
DISTRICTS YOU MENTIONED ARE THE

01:08:06.015 --> 01:08:07.817

01:08:07.883 --> 01:08:09.819
HIGHER STANDARD OF LIVING AND I

01:08:09.885 --> 01:08:13.756
KNOW EVEN THE SENATE OFFERS A- A

01:08:13.823 --> 01:08:16.859
PAY DIFFERENTIAL. FOLLOWED TO

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:19.228
POISON HARDTO FIT IN HIGH

01:08:19.295 --> 01:08:20.930
INCOME AREAS WHERE IT'S HARD TO

01:08:20.996 --> 01:08:23.999
FIND HOUSING. IN THAT THERE WAS

01:08:24.066 --> 01:08:25.568
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE

01:08:25.634 --> 01:08:27.303
OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE WAS CHARGED

01:08:27.369 --> 01:08:30.306
WITH WALKING AT. WAS WHETHER OR

01:08:30.372 --> 01:08:33.609
NOT. FROM THERE SHOULD BE

01:08:33.676 --> 01:08:35.110
ADJUSTMENTS FOR DIFFERENCES IN

01:08:35.177 --> 01:08:36.912
REGIONAL COST OF LIVING AND I

01:08:36.979 --> 01:08:37.513
NOTICED THERE'S NO

01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:40.683
RECOMMENDATION HERE ABOUT THAT.

01:08:40.749 --> 01:08:43.719
WHY IS THAT THE CASE AND I DON'T

01:08:43.786 --> 01:08:47.256
KNOW WHO CAN TAKE THAT QUESTION

01:08:47.323 --> 01:08:48.891
. MAYBE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:08:48.958 --> 01:08:54.330
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. DINNERWARE

01:08:54.396 --> 01:08:56.031
AND IT'S- IT IS OUR

01:08:56.098 --> 01:08:57.867
UNDERSTANDING THAT THE OVERSIGHT

01:08:57.933 --> 01:09:00.903
COMMITTEE I DID NOT- LAND DATA

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:03.506
AND SCHOOL RECOMMENDATION AROUND

01:09:03.572 --> 01:09:04.540
THE REGIONAL COST OF LIVING

01:09:04.607 --> 01:09:06.876
ISSUE AND SO NOTHING WAS PUT

01:09:06.942 --> 01:09:09.345
FORWARD SHE THE ADMINISTRATION

01:09:09.411 --> 01:09:11.213
OF THE LEGISLATURE- THAT

01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:14.183
SPECIFIED HOW ARE THAT COULD BE

01:09:14.250 --> 01:09:17.653
CONSIDERED- THERE WERE HOWEVER

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:19.588
RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND A FIRST

01:09:19.655 --> 01:09:22.091
GENERATION- WHICH COULD HELP

01:09:22.157 --> 01:09:23.859
MIDDLEMAN ASK ABOUT THE FIRST

01:09:23.926 --> 01:09:25.528
GENERATION UNLESS YOU'RE DRAWING

01:09:25.594 --> 01:09:29.031
A CONCLUSION. IN RELATION TO MY

01:09:29.098 --> 01:09:31.901
QUESTION. HI MY JUST THE

01:09:31.967 --> 01:09:34.403
CONCLUDE- WOULD BE THAT ONE

01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:35.671
OPTION AGAIN IS TO CONSIDER

01:09:35.738 --> 01:09:37.139
FIRST GENERATION BECAUSE THAT

01:09:37.206 --> 01:09:38.941
COULD ALSO BECOME THIS-

01:09:39.008 --> 01:09:40.976
INDIVIDUALS IN SOME OF THOSE

01:09:41.043 --> 01:09:42.478
DISTRICTS THAT YOU HIGHLIGHTED

01:09:42.545 --> 01:09:44.280
I'M GOING TO ASK ABOUT THAT IN A

01:09:44.346 --> 01:09:48.784
MOMENT BUT- THE- OHIO. IS RATHER

01:09:48.851 --> 01:09:50.719
FLIGHTY WITH HIS RAISED HANDS IT

01:09:50.786 --> 01:09:52.288
WAS UP IN ITS DOWN SO I DON'T

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:53.756
KNOW IF YOU HAD ANYTHING THAT

01:09:53.822 --> 01:09:56.559
YOU WANTED TO ADD TO THAT. IT'S

01:09:56.625 --> 01:09:58.794
NOT YOU WELL YEAH I JUST TO MAKE

01:09:58.861 --> 01:10:00.863
THE POINT DONE. IN VERY WHAT IS

01:10:00.930 --> 01:10:02.665
THAT NUMBER IT SAID IS THAT THE

01:10:02.731 --> 01:10:05.734
OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE. LOOKED AT

01:10:05.801 --> 01:10:09.238
THE- THE- IDEA OF. MAKING

01:10:09.305 --> 01:10:11.574
ADJUSTMENTS TO THE SCF AFTER

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:14.076
REFLECT HIGHER COST OF LIVING-

01:10:14.143 --> 01:10:15.611
AREAS OF THE STATE AND

01:10:15.678 --> 01:10:18.247
ULTIMATELY DID NOT. AGREE AND

01:10:18.314 --> 01:10:20.349
DID NOT HAVE A RECOMMENDATION SO

01:10:20.416 --> 01:10:21.417
THAT WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT THEY

01:10:21.483 --> 01:10:23.886
HAD. RECOMMENDED FOR- ME JUST

01:10:23.953 --> 01:10:25.154
MAKE A COMMENT I THINK THAT'S

01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:26.422
UNFORTUNATE AND WE SHOULD NOT

01:10:26.488 --> 01:10:28.591
LET GO OF THE ISSUE. BECAUSE

01:10:28.657 --> 01:10:30.693
WE'VE GOT THE SITUATION. WHERE

01:10:30.759 --> 01:10:32.628
THE HOLD HARMLESS AGREEMENT IS

01:10:32.695 --> 01:10:34.530
CUTTING SUBSTANTIALLY COLLEGE

01:10:34.597 --> 01:10:37.766
DISTRICTS IN HIGH INCOME AREAS.

01:10:37.833 --> 01:10:39.768
AND SO THEY GET A DOUBLE WHAMMY.

01:10:39.835 --> 01:10:41.370
ARE THEY CAN'T HIRE PEOPLE

01:10:41.437 --> 01:10:42.972
BECAUSE OF THE HIGH INTEREST AND

01:10:43.038 --> 01:10:43.906
THEY'RE GOING TO BE CUT

01:10:43.973 --> 01:10:47.142
SUBSTANTIALLY SO. SOMEBODY NEEDS

01:10:47.209 --> 01:10:48.944
TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND-

01:10:49.011 --> 01:10:50.846
BECAUSE THEY DEADLOCKED IS NOT

01:10:50.913 --> 01:10:52.114
AN ADEQUATE RESPONSE WHEN WE GO

01:10:52.181 --> 01:10:53.749
OUT TO THESE DISTRICTS AND SAY

01:10:53.816 --> 01:10:58.120
WE'RE NOT ADDRESSING THE. ISSUE

01:10:58.187 --> 01:10:59.455
SO I HOPE THAT SOMEHOW. ASSEMBLY

01:10:59.521 --> 01:11:01.590
CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY FOR US TO

01:11:01.657 --> 01:11:02.992
ADDRESS THE ISSUE THEN ON THE

01:11:03.058 --> 01:11:06.395
RECOMMENDATION. ON THE METRIC OF

01:11:06.462 --> 01:11:11.300
THE FIRST GENERATION- A STUDENT

01:11:11.367 --> 01:11:16.138
WHICH IS IN HERE. ARM ON THE

01:11:16.205 --> 01:11:18.240
POLICY LEVEL OF COURSE IT MAKES

01:11:18.307 --> 01:11:20.476
TOTAL SENSE BUT I CAN'T TELL

01:11:20.542 --> 01:11:22.778
ANYWHERE IN HERE WHAT THE IMPACT

01:11:22.845 --> 01:11:25.381
IS TO INDIVIDUAL DISTRICTS DO WE

01:11:25.447 --> 01:11:28.450
KNOW IF IT'S ADDED WHAT THAT

01:11:28.517 --> 01:11:31.120
DOES TO INDIVIDUAL. DISTRICTS ON

01:11:31.186 --> 01:11:34.056
THE FORMULA. I WOULD START WITH

01:11:34.123 --> 01:11:36.158
THE OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:11:36.225 --> 01:11:37.893
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE BUT WE CAN

01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:40.629
GO ANYWHERE ON THIS. THE NEW

01:11:40.696 --> 01:11:44.500
LAYERED- CURRENTLY THERE. THE

01:11:44.566 --> 01:11:46.735
DEFINITION FOR FIRST GENERATION

01:11:46.802 --> 01:11:48.904
THAT WAS RECOMMENDED BY THE

01:11:48.971 --> 01:11:51.206
OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE WAS NOT ONE

01:11:51.273 --> 01:11:53.142
THAT- COMMUNITY COLLEGES

01:11:53.208 --> 01:11:55.611
REPORTED WERE COLLECTED THAT

01:11:55.678 --> 01:11:57.312
CHANGE WAS MADE TWO YEARS AGO

01:11:57.379 --> 01:11:58.514
AND SO WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO

01:11:58.580 --> 01:12:00.916
COLLECT THAT INFORMATION TO HAVE

01:12:00.983 --> 01:12:04.953
CONSISTENCY. ANY METRICS TIED TO

01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:07.623
FUNDINGGENERALLY HAVE MULTI

01:12:07.690 --> 01:12:09.692
YEARS THAT WE CAN REFERENCE HER

01:12:09.758 --> 01:12:12.528
ALSO AUDITED NUMBERS SO THAT WE

01:12:12.594 --> 01:12:14.196
CAN PROVIDE ACCOUNTABILITY

01:12:14.263 --> 01:12:16.598
NEITHER OF THOSE ELEMENTS EXIST

01:12:16.665 --> 01:12:19.101
RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE

01:12:19.168 --> 01:12:22.137
CONSISTENT DATA AND THEREFORE-

01:12:22.204 --> 01:12:24.707
WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THAT

01:12:24.773 --> 01:12:26.775
IMPACT WOULD BE ON INDIVIDUAL

01:12:26.842 --> 01:12:28.410
DISTRICTS BROUGHT ME JUST SAY

01:12:28.477 --> 01:12:30.345
THAT'S A MATTER OF GREAT CONCERN

01:12:30.412 --> 01:12:31.547
BECAUSE WE'RE SITTING HERE

01:12:31.613 --> 01:12:33.048
FIDDLING WITH THE IMPACTS OF THE

01:12:33.115 --> 01:12:36.218
LAST FORMULA. WHICH HAD STRONG

01:12:36.285 --> 01:12:37.953
IMPACTS ON DIFFERENT DISTRICTS

01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:39.054
AND NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A

01:12:39.121 --> 01:12:40.222
CHANGE IN THE FORMULA WITH NO

01:12:40.289 --> 01:12:41.557
IDEA HOW IT IMPACTS THE

01:12:41.623 --> 01:12:43.292
DISTRICT'S EVEN ON A POLICY

01:12:43.358 --> 01:12:45.394
LEVEL WE ALL THINK THA MAKES

01:12:45.461 --> 01:12:48.030
GREAT SENSE AS A METRIC AND SO I

01:12:48.097 --> 01:12:50.065
THINK. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A

01:12:50.132 --> 01:12:51.800
COMFORT LEVEL THAT WE'RE NOT

01:12:51.867 --> 01:12:53.068
GONNA HAVE A GROUP OF ANGRY

01:12:53.135 --> 01:12:55.170
DISTRICTS COMING BACK TO US NEXT

01:12:55.237 --> 01:12:57.239
YEAR BECAUSE THEY ALL SAY WE

01:12:57.306 --> 01:12:59.341
DIDN'T SEE THIS COMING SO-

01:12:59.408 --> 01:13:01.610
THERE'S GOTTA BE A WAY TO FIGURE

01:13:01.677 --> 01:13:04.046
THAT OUT AND I THINK. IT IN

01:13:04.113 --> 01:13:06.548
GEERAL ON THIS AND YES I

01:13:06.615 --> 01:13:09.918
REPRESENTS. A LOT OF DISTRICTS

01:13:09.985 --> 01:13:12.888
THAT ARE. THAT ARE SUBJECT TO

01:13:12.955 --> 01:13:14.490
THE HOLD HARMLESS AND I THINK

01:13:14.556 --> 01:13:16.258
THERE'S THESE LARGER ISSUES SAN

01:13:16.325 --> 01:13:18.494
JUAN AND I APOLOGIZE FOR

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:23.198
TELLING- THIS STORY OVER AND

01:13:23.265 --> 01:13:26.568
OVER AGAIN HOME BUT IT RELATES

01:13:26.635 --> 01:13:30.005
IN SOME WAYS IT TO THE THERE'S

01:13:30.072 --> 01:13:32.207
ALL THE SENATE ONCE AGAIN THIS

01:13:32.274 --> 01:13:35.177
IS TIED TO FOUR OTHER ITEMS SUCH

01:13:35.244 --> 01:13:37.613
AS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND SOME

01:13:37.679 --> 01:13:40.315
OF AND HOUSING AND SOME OF THE

01:13:40.382 --> 01:13:41.583
OTHER ITEMS THAT WE ARE STILL

01:13:41.650 --> 01:13:43.085
GOING TO CONTINUE. TO COST LATER

01:13:43.152 --> 01:13:49.391
IN THE END OF. AND OUR COMMUNITY

01:13:49.458 --> 01:13:51.693
COLLEGE. HAVE OF THE DOOR GOALS

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:53.262
OF FLY LEARNING AND TRANSFER

01:13:53.328 --> 01:13:55.697
BILL. WHICH IS REALLY THE CENTER

01:13:55.764 --> 01:13:57.566
OF THE OF THE STUDENT CENTERED

01:13:57.633 --> 01:14:00.269
FUNDING FORMULA IN MANY WAYS AND

01:14:00.335 --> 01:14:03.005
BY TAKING AWAY REPEATABILITY.

01:14:03.071 --> 01:14:05.407
HAND SORT OF WEAKENING THE

01:14:05.474 --> 01:14:07.042
LIFELONG LEARNING PART OF THE

01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:09.178
DEAL WILL GOALS. THE LOCAL

01:14:09.244 --> 01:14:11.180
SUPPORT FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES

01:14:11.246 --> 01:14:13.148
IS DROPPED SO I WAS THE CO CHAIR%

01:14:13.215 --> 01:14:16.218
OF THE CAMPAIGN FOR THE FIRST

01:14:16.285 --> 01:14:17.352
TIME IN THIRTY YEARS FOR A BOND

01:14:17.419 --> 01:14:18.787
MEASURE. AND WHEN WE WENT IN THE

01:14:18.854 --> 01:14:21.857
LAST YEAR REQUIRED TWO THIRDS

01:14:21.924 --> 01:14:22.591
NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT WE GOT 74%

01:14:22.658 --> 01:14:24.459
OF THE VOTE. AND ONCE

01:14:24.526 --> 01:14:27.763
REPEATABILITY WAS TAKEN AWAY AND

01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:30.432
LOCAL SUPPORT STARTED TO A TOLD

01:14:30.499 --> 01:14:32.835
LANE FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES

01:14:32.901 --> 01:14:36.772
TWICE THEY COULD NOT GET 55% AND

01:14:36.839 --> 01:14:38.740
YEP WHEN WE GO FURTHER IN THIS

01:14:38.807 --> 01:14:41.877
AGENDA ONE OF THE REASONS WHY

01:14:41.944 --> 01:14:43.579
COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE SAID TO

01:14:43.645 --> 01:14:45.147
BE CONSIDERED DIFFERENTLY THAN

01:14:45.214 --> 01:14:48.383
YOU SEE AND CSU. IS THE LOCAL

01:14:48.450 --> 01:14:50.452
ABILITY TO GO TO TAXES WHICH HAS

01:14:50.519 --> 01:14:52.087
BEEN WEAKENED BY THE CHANGE IN

01:14:52.154 --> 01:14:54.289
THE OVERALL WAY WE LOOK AT

01:14:54.356 --> 01:14:57.226
COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND THE

01:14:57.292 --> 01:15:00.495
TIRED STORY I KEEP TELLING THEY

01:15:00.562 --> 01:15:02.798
SET IN THAT BALLOT MEASURE. WAS

01:15:02.865 --> 01:15:06.201
A STE A CENTER IN WATSONVILLE

01:15:06.268 --> 01:15:07.936
THAT WAS EIGHT MILES FROM THE

01:15:08.003 --> 01:15:09.304
CAMPUS BUT WE KNOW ARM ROMAN

01:15:09.371 --> 01:15:11.640
WENT UP DRAMATICALLY FROM

01:15:11.707 --> 01:15:13.508
DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS AT ONE

01:15:13.575 --> 01:15:15.444
TRAVEL EIGHT MILES TO THE CAMPUS

01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:17.813
BECAUSE WE DID THAT CENTER. AND

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:20.349
IF THERE IS A- A COMPACTION

01:15:20.415 --> 01:15:21.416
BECAUSE OF THE STUDENT CENTERED

01:15:21.483 --> 01:15:23.385
FUNDING FORMULA AND NO HOLD

01:15:23.452 --> 01:15:25.921
HARMLESS. THAT'S LIKELY ONE OF

01:15:25.988 --> 01:15:27.456
THE THINGS TO GO BECAUSE YOUR

01:15:27.522 --> 01:15:29.424
CORE CAMPUSES WHAT'S GOING TO BE

01:15:29.491 --> 01:15:31.827
PROTECTED. AND THE

01:15:31.894 --> 01:15:34.596
COUNTERINTUITIVE THING ABOUT

01:15:34.663 --> 01:15:37.266
THIS. SAN THE FORMULA ON

01:15:37.332 --> 01:15:39.268
STUDENTS IN A WAR MANY OF WHOM

01:15:39.334 --> 01:15:41.637
ARE DISADVANTAGED WHAT WILL HAVE

01:15:41.703 --> 01:15:43.906
A- A COUNTERINTUITIVE OUTCOME

01:15:43.972 --> 01:15:47.042
AND SO- THAT'S ONE OF THE

01:15:47.109 --> 01:15:48.176
REASONS I'VE NOT BEEN A TOTAL

01:15:48.243 --> 01:15:51.079
FAN. AND I HAVE TO SUBSCRIBE TO

01:15:51.146 --> 01:15:52.681
SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT THE L.

01:15:52.748 --> 01:15:55.918
A. O. MADE. IN THE SENSE THAT

01:15:55.984 --> 01:15:59.121
THIS CREATES. A PERMANENT FLOOR

01:15:59.187 --> 01:16:01.189
THAT REMOVES INCENTIVES AND I

01:16:01.256 --> 01:16:03.525
THINK IT IS GREAT TO HAVE THE

01:16:03.592 --> 01:16:05.260
HOLD HARMLESS EXTENDED IN SOME

01:16:05.327 --> 01:16:07.162
FORM. BUT IT WOULD BE NICE TO

01:16:07.229 --> 01:16:09.564
FIGURE OUT A WAY IF THE BASE

01:16:09.631 --> 01:16:11.500
ACUALLY TRULY HOLD PEOPLE

01:16:11.566 --> 01:16:13.802
HARMLESS AT THEIR EXISTING LEVEL

01:16:13.869 --> 01:16:15.270
AND REWARDS AT A HIGHER LEVEL

01:16:15.337 --> 01:16:16.571
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING WELL

01:16:16.638 --> 01:16:18.473
ON THE STUDENT CENTERED. FUNDING

01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:20.842
FORMULA THAT CRUDE DOESN'T

01:16:20.909 --> 01:16:22.344
CREATE WINNERS AND LOSERS THAT

01:16:22.411 --> 01:16:24.413
CREATES WINNERS AND WINNERS SO

01:16:24.479 --> 01:16:26.615
THE QUESTION IS. IS IN OUR

01:16:26.682 --> 01:16:28.617
DISCUSSION OF THIS GOING FORWARD

01:16:28.684 --> 01:16:30.052
AND OF COURSE IF WE APPROVE THE

01:16:30.118 --> 01:16:32.254
HOLD HARMLESS. AS PROPOSED BY

01:16:32.321 --> 01:16:33.956
THE GOVERNOR WE STRIVE FOR YEAR

01:16:34.022 --> 01:16:35.424
TWO TWO ADJUSTED BUT I HATE KEEP

01:16:35.490 --> 01:16:37.559
KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD I

01:16:37.626 --> 01:16:39.294
THINK IT IS REALLY ABOUT.

01:16:39.361 --> 01:16:42.030
FINDING SOME SWEET SPOT OF THAT

01:16:42.097 --> 01:16:44.599
DOES THIS AND FACTORING IN THE

01:16:44.666 --> 01:16:46.702
REGIONAL COST OF LIVING. IS

01:16:46.768 --> 01:16:48.370
SEEMS TO BE ONE OF THE THINGS

01:16:48.437 --> 01:16:51.440
THAT ACTUALLY IS AN ISSUE WITH A

01:16:51.506 --> 01:16:53.041
SOME OF THE VERY DISTRICTS THAT

01:16:53.108 --> 01:16:54.943
WERE NAMED AS BEING IN THE HOLD

01:16:55.010 --> 01:16:57.412
HARMLESS. AND I KNOW WE HAD THIS

01:16:57.479 --> 01:16:59.147
PROBLEM WHEN I WAS A COULD BRIO

01:16:59.214 --> 01:17:03.185
AND I'VE. NOT BEEN ON THE BOARD

01:17:03.251 --> 01:17:04.319
IN TWENTY YEARS. WHERE WE WERE

01:17:04.386 --> 01:17:04.987
HAVE TROUBLE. RECRUITING FACULTY

01:17:05.053 --> 01:17:06.955
BECAUSE OF THE COST OF LIVING

01:17:07.022 --> 01:17:09.024
AND SO EVERY TIME WE HAD A NEW

01:17:09.091 --> 01:17:10.492
FULL TIME FACULTY MEMBER

01:17:10.559 --> 01:17:12.661
ANNOUNCED UC SANTA CRUZ. WE

01:17:12.728 --> 01:17:14.329
SEARCH TO SEE IF THEY HAD A

01:17:14.396 --> 01:17:15.330
SPOUSE WAS GOING TO BE LOOKING

01:17:15.397 --> 01:17:17.065
FOR A JOB TO TRY TO RECRUIT THEM

01:17:17.132 --> 01:17:18.900
INTO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AS A

01:17:18.967 --> 01:17:23.171
WAY TO GET AROUND THE HOUSING-ISSUE. AND SO I AM JUST HOPING.

01:17:23.238 --> 01:17:25.774
THAT THERE ARE WAYS TO ADDRESS

01:17:25.841 --> 01:17:26.675
THIS GOING FORWARD AND I THINK

01:17:26.742 --> 01:17:28.543
THIS BUDGET. HAS SOMEREALLY

01:17:28.610 --> 01:17:31.680
POSITIVE A STEPS TOWARD IT. BUT

01:17:31.747 --> 01:17:33.882
IT DOESN'T FULLY GET THE IRAN

01:17:33.949 --> 01:17:35.384
AND WHEN I WAS BUDGET CHAIR IN

01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:37.986
THE ASSEMBLY FROM 200-042-2000

01:17:38.053 --> 01:17:40.989
EIGHT. WE HAD TO DEAL WITH WHAT

01:17:41.056 --> 01:17:41.990
WAS KNOWN AS THE EQUALIZATION

01:17:42.057 --> 01:17:44.726
ISSUE. AND WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT

01:17:44.793 --> 01:17:46.828
MANY K. THROUGH TWELVE DISTRICTS

01:17:46.895 --> 01:17:48.797
WERE LOCKED INTO THEIR FUNDING

01:17:48.864 --> 01:17:50.899
AT THE TIME OF PROP NINETY EIGHT

01:17:50.966 --> 01:17:52.467
BASED ON THE FACTORS THAT WENT

01:17:52.534 --> 01:17:56.671
THERE. AND A LOT OF THE CHANGING

01:17:56.738 --> 01:17:58.006
FACTORS WERE NOT. ARE TAKEN INTO

01:17:58.073 --> 01:18:00.042
ACCOUNT BECAUSE IT WAS LOCKED IN

01:18:00.108 --> 01:18:01.710
AND THEN IS DISTRICTS CHANGE

01:18:01.777 --> 01:18:03.412
PARTICULARLY IN SUBURBAN AREAS

01:18:03.478 --> 01:18:04.279
THEY WERE DISADVANTAGED IN THE

01:18:04.346 --> 01:18:06.214
FORMULA. BECAUSE OF WHAT IT BEEN

01:18:06.281 --> 01:18:08.316
LOCKED IN BASED ON CIRCUMSTANCES

01:18:08.383 --> 01:18:10.419
THAT NO LONGER EXISTED. AND IF

01:18:10.485 --> 01:18:12.487
WE DON'T FIGURE OUT A LONG TERM

01:18:12.554 --> 01:18:14.056
SOLUTION. FOR THE STUDENT

01:18:14.122 --> 01:18:16.191
CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA WE WILL

01:18:16.258 --> 01:18:17.859
BE DOING THE SAME THING WILL BE

01:18:17.926 --> 01:18:20.495
LOCKING IN. A CIRCUMSTANCES FROM

01:18:20.562 --> 01:18:22.764
THE PAST IN A WAY THAT SOME

01:18:22.831 --> 01:18:24.499
FUTURE LEGISLATURE IN SOME

01:18:24.566 --> 01:18:27.069
FUTURE CHANCELLOR. ALTHOUGH DAM

01:18:27.135 --> 01:18:28.303
LOOKS YOUNG ENOUGH THAT HE'LL BE

01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:30.405
THE PERSON IT'LL BE HERE TRYING

01:18:30.472 --> 01:18:32.474
TO FIX IT FOR FINANCE. ARE WE

01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:33.475
WOULD THEN HAVE TO DEAL WITH

01:18:33.542 --> 01:18:36.912
THAT ARE GOING FORWARD SO. I

01:18:36.978 --> 01:18:38.313
JUST FEEL OBLIGATED TO OFFER

01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:40.749
THAT IS CONVERSATION AS WE HEAD

01:18:40.816 --> 01:18:42.884
TOWARD THE MAY REVISE AND TRYING

01:18:42.951 --> 01:18:45.053
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CONTINUE TO

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:46.822
ADDRESS. SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT

01:18:46.888 --> 01:18:48.757
WE'VE ALL BEEN TALKING HERE.

01:18:48.824 --> 01:18:51.093

BEARING WITH ME ON THAT BUT- BUT

01:18:56.198 --> 01:18:58.467
THIS IS A BIG DEAL AND WE ARE

01:18:58.533 --> 01:18:59.935
GOING TO HAVE TO ADDRESS THESE

01:19:00.001 --> 01:19:04.172
ISSUES. AND SOME BY ME YES. SIR

01:19:04.239 --> 01:19:05.240

01:19:13.215 --> 01:19:15.984
TENSIONS BETWEEN. THE SCF I'LL

01:19:16.051 --> 01:19:20.222
STOP USING ACRONYM- AND- THE

01:19:20.288 --> 01:19:22.557

MADE EARLIER AND ISSUE ONE.

01:19:26.928 --> 01:19:28.363
WHICH IS I HINK IT'S REALLY

01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:29.431
IMPORTANT FOR US TO DRILL DOWN

01:19:29.498 --> 01:19:31.199
AND FIGURE OUT WHAT ENROLLMENT

01:19:31.266 --> 01:19:32.167
IS GONNA LOOK LIKE AND TO WHAT

01:19:32.234 --> 01:19:34.369
DEGREE. ENROLLMENT CHANGES ARE

01:19:34.436 --> 01:19:36.004
DRIVEN BY TEMPORARY COVERT

01:19:36.071 --> 01:19:38.406
RELATED ITEMS VIS A VIS LONGER

01:19:38.473 --> 01:19:41.510
STRUCTURAL ISSUES. BECAUSE IT

01:19:41.576 --> 01:19:42.377
DOES STRIKE ME THAT WE ARE

01:19:42.444 --> 01:19:44.412
SEEING PERHAPS SOME MORE THAN

01:19:44.479 --> 01:19:45.881
TEMPORARY DECLINES IN ROME AND

01:19:45.947 --> 01:19:47.816
THOSE MIGHT BE SIGNIFICANT. AND

01:19:47.883 --> 01:19:49.584
IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN THEN WE

01:19:49.651 --> 01:19:51.853
IT IS BETTER AS AS CHAIR LEONARD

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:54.189
POINTED OUT. FOR US TO GET AHEAD

01:19:54.256 --> 01:19:55.190
OF THIS AND I'M MINDFUL OF THE

01:19:55.257 --> 01:19:57.159
FACT THAT. WE HAVE A LOT OF

01:19:57.225 --> 01:19:57.959
ISSUES IN OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES

01:19:58.026 --> 01:20:00.362
AND WE ARE RESOURCE STARVED AND

01:20:00.428 --> 01:20:02.430
WE HAVE DEPRIVED THE CCC'S. FOR

01:20:02.497 --> 01:20:03.732
SOME PERIOD OF TIME OF THE

01:20:03.798 --> 01:20:05.100
RESOURCES THAT YOU NEED TO

01:20:05.167 --> 01:20:06.001
EFFECTIVELY EDUCATE OUR

01:20:06.067 --> 01:20:08.203
STUDENTS. AT THE SAME TIME A FOR

01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:11.106
FACING MAJOR STRUCTURAL DECLINES

01:20:11.173 --> 01:20:12.140
IN ENROLLMENT. THE THAT'S

01:20:12.207 --> 01:20:13.575
SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO REALLY

01:20:13.642 --> 01:20:15.143
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT AS WE DECIDE

01:20:15.210 --> 01:20:16.511
HOW TO ALLOCATE SCARCE RESOURCES

01:20:16.578 --> 01:20:18.280
SO- YOU KNOW I WOULD JUST

01:20:18.346 --> 01:20:19.881

SUBCOMMITTEE. THAT IT WOULD BE

01:20:25.253 --> 01:20:26.721
REALLY REALLY HELPFUL FOR US TO

01:20:26.788 --> 01:20:28.857
HAVE MORE DATA. ON ON WHAT IS IN

01:20:28.924 --> 01:20:30.058

LAYERED. THIS IS REALLY AN ISSUE

01:22:07.355 --> 01:22:08.590
WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS

01:22:08.657 --> 01:22:10.592
MORE INFORMATION ON TO MAKE A

01:22:10.659 --> 01:22:13.361
DECISION AS YOUR AGENDA NOTES

01:22:13.428 --> 01:22:14.429
THE GOVERNOR WOULD LIKE TO

01:22:14.496 --> 01:22:16.398
EXPAND HEALTH CARE COVERAGE TO

01:22:16.464 --> 01:22:18.566
PART TIME FACULTY IN PART TIME

01:22:18.633 --> 01:22:20.602
FACULTY ARE CRITICAL PART OF THE

01:22:20.669 --> 01:22:21.836
CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES

01:22:21.903 --> 01:22:23.204
AND STATE CERTAINLY HAS AN

01:22:23.271 --> 01:22:24.739
INTEREST IN MAKING SURE YOU'RE

01:22:24.806 --> 01:22:26.708
TAKING CARE OF. YET THE

01:22:26.775 --> 01:22:28.877
LEGISLATURE DOES NOT HAVE SOME

01:22:28.943 --> 01:22:30.312
BASIC INFORMATION IT REALLY

01:22:30.378 --> 01:22:32.080
NEEDS LEGISLATURE DOESN'T KNOW

01:22:32.147 --> 01:22:33.982
HOW MANY PART TIME FACULTY

01:22:34.049 --> 01:22:36.484
ALREADY HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE

01:22:36.551 --> 01:22:38.787
AND WHERE THEY GET THAT COVERAGE

01:22:38.853 --> 01:22:40.789
FROM THE LEGISLATURE ALSO

01:22:40.855 --> 01:22:42.657
DOESN'T KNOW HOW MANY LACK.

01:22:42.724 --> 01:22:45.093
HEALTH CARE INSURANCE DESPITE

01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:46.661
THE STATE'S REQUIREMENTS FOR

01:22:46.728 --> 01:22:48.129
CALIFORNIANS TO HAVE ADEQUATE

01:22:48.196 --> 01:22:50.231
HEALTHCARE COVERAGE SO WITHOUT

01:22:50.298 --> 01:22:52.734
THIS INFORMATION IT'S REALLY NOT

01:22:52.801 --> 01:22:54.803
POSSIBLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

01:22:54.869 --> 01:22:57.072
DETERMINE IF THERE'S A PROBLEM

01:22:57.138 --> 01:22:59.307
AND HOW WIDESPREAD THAT PROBLEM

01:22:59.374 --> 01:23:02.344
MIGHT BE. THE LEGISLATURE DOES

01:23:02.410 --> 01:23:04.212
NOTE THAT A NUMBER OF DISTRICTS

01:23:04.279 --> 01:23:06.648
DO OFFER HEALTH CARE TO PART

01:23:06.715 --> 01:23:08.383
TIME FACULTY BUT THE LEGISLATURE

COST THAT EMPLOYEES MUST BEAR

01:23:16.524 --> 01:23:18.193
AND WHETHER SOME PART TIME

01:23:18.259 --> 01:23:19.661
FACULTY MIGHT HAVE BEEN BETTER

01:23:19.728 --> 01:23:20.929
OFF GETTING COVERAGE THROUGH

01:23:20.995 --> 01:23:23.698

PROVIDE SUBSIDIES FOR MONEY

01:23:25.467 --> 01:23:27.902
CALIFORNIANS. SO THE GOVERNOR'S

01:23:27.969 --> 01:23:29.637
APPROACH TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE

01:23:29.704 --> 01:23:30.605
TO PART TIME FACULTY THROUGH

01:23:30.672 --> 01:23:35.543
DISTRICT. SPONSORED COVERAGE- I

01:23:35.610 --> 01:23:36.478
CAN UNDERSTAND WHERE HE'S COMING

01:23:36.544 --> 01:23:37.645
FROM THERE BUT YET THE THERE'S

01:23:37.712 --> 01:23:40.682
AN ISSUE ABOUT PART TIME FACULTY

01:23:40.749 --> 01:23:42.083
THEY'RE CONSIDERED TEMPORARY

01:23:42.150 --> 01:23:44.285
EMPLOYEES OF THE DISTRICT. AND

01:23:44.352 --> 01:23:46.788
THEY MAY NOT BE RETAIN FROM ONE

01:23:46.855 --> 01:23:48.656
YEAR TO THE NEXT OR EVEN ONE

01:23:48.723 --> 01:23:50.859
SEMESTER TO THE NEXT SO EVEN IF

THE DISTRICT. WERE TO OFFER A

01:23:52.694 --> 01:23:54.829
ROBUST COVERAGE TO PART TIME

01:23:54.896 --> 01:23:57.232
FACULTY THE LEGISLATURE FACES AS

01:23:57.298 --> 01:23:58.867
PART OF A LARGER POLICY QUESTION

01:23:58.933 --> 01:24:00.468
ABOUT WHETHER A COMMUNITY

01:24:00.535 --> 01:24:04.439
COLLEGE PROGRAM IS THE BEST WAY

01:24:04.506 --> 01:24:05.006
TO PROVIDE THEM WITH HEALTH

01:24:05.073 --> 01:24:07.075

01:24:07.142 --> 01:24:09.110

01:24:13.948 --> 01:24:15.316
THEN OFF WHEN THEY ARE NOT

01:24:15.383 --> 01:24:18.620
OFFERED. OF COURSE TO TEACH. AND

01:24:18.686 --> 01:24:20.021
OF COURSE THERE'S THIS ISSUE

01:24:20.088 --> 01:24:21.756
ABOUT WHAT ABOUT OTHER PART TIME

01:24:21.823 --> 01:24:23.825

HUNDRED AND NINETY THOUSAND

01:25:40.702 --> 01:25:43.037

THOUSAND PROGRAM BUT WITH ADDED

OTHERS CAN POTENTIALLY

01:26:17.372 --> 01:26:19.207

QUESTIONS I STRONGLY SUPPORT

01:26:30.151 --> 01:26:31.886
THIS AND I THINK THAT THE- THE

01:26:31.953 --> 01:26:34.355
QUESTIONS ARE ABOUT TO ASK ARE

01:26:34.422 --> 01:26:35.557

THERE AND SO. I WAS GONNA S.

01:26:47.802 --> 01:26:50.004
FINANCE FIRST FROM WHAT THE

01:26:50.071 --> 01:26:52.941
ANALYTICAL BASIS WAS FOR THE TWO

01:26:53.007 --> 01:26:55.643
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS- A

01:26:55.710 --> 01:26:58.846
NUMBER THAT'S IN THE BUDGET TO

01:26:58.913 --> 01:27:02.617
ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. SURE SO THE

01:27:02.684 --> 01:27:04.519
TWO HUNDRED MILLION I THINK I

01:27:04.586 --> 01:27:05.386
THINK REFLECTS THE

01:27:05.453 --> 01:27:08.122

NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE SO I

01:27:24.872 --> 01:27:25.807
THINK IN TEN TERMS OF WHY

01:27:25.873 --> 01:27:26.741
SPECIFICALLY TWO HUNDRED NINE

01:27:26.808 --> 01:27:27.308
IT'S- IT'S REALLY THOSE TWO

01:27:27.375 --> 01:27:29.377
FACTORS BALANCED OF. AVAILABLE

TIME FACULTY DON'T HAVE HEALTH

01:27:41.956 --> 01:27:45.627
INSURANCE HOW MUCH IT'LL COST

01:27:45.693 --> 01:27:46.794
AND WHETHER THIS IS AN ADEQUATE

01:27:46.861 --> 01:27:50.031
NUMBER- I WOULD HAVE TO DEFER TO

01:27:50.098 --> 01:27:51.165

WHO CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE HEALTH

01:27:57.905 --> 01:28:01.309

01:28:02.577 --> 01:28:03.711
TO SIGNAL THE- ADMINISTRATION'S

01:28:03.778 --> 01:28:05.213
STRONG. INTEREST IN PROVIDING

01:28:05.279 --> 01:28:06.648
GREATER LEVELS OF PART TIME

01:28:06.714 --> 01:28:08.950

THE- ENTER ENTER IS A PROGRAM

01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:13.287
DESIGNED IN IMPACTED THIS

01:28:13.354 --> 01:28:14.155
PROPOSAL I THINK THAT'S

01:28:14.222 --> 01:28:15.857
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE- CONTINUING

01:28:15.923 --> 01:28:18.726
TO- TRY TO LEARN MORE ABOUT IN

01:28:18.793 --> 01:28:20.862
CONVERSATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS-

01:28:20.928 --> 01:28:22.063
AS WELL AS OUR ARE PARTNERS IN

01:28:22.130 --> 01:28:28.436
THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. AND.

01:28:28.503 --> 01:28:29.003
PRETTY SIGNIFICANT NEW

01:28:29.070 --> 01:28:31.472
INVESTMENTS- IN THIS PROGRAM

01:28:31.539 --> 01:28:33.908
THAT'S CURRENTLY FUNDED AT ABOUT

01:28:33.975 --> 01:28:35.643
FOUR HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND.

01:28:35.710 --> 01:28:37.912
DOLLARS AN ONGOING BASIS AND SO

01:28:37.979 --> 01:28:39.814
I THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE- A

01:28:39.881 --> 01:28:40.848
LOT MORE THAT WE'RE LEARNING

01:28:40.915 --> 01:28:43.685
ABOUT THIS- BASED BASED ON THIS

01:28:43.751 --> 01:28:44.485
THAT THE LEVEL OF BUSINESS

01:28:44.552 --> 01:28:45.953
INVESTMENT AND THEN LET ME ASK

01:28:46.020 --> 01:28:46.921
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:28:46.988 --> 01:28:48.623
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IF SHE COULD

01:28:48.690 --> 01:28:50.925
REFLECT ON THE QUESTION. YES

01:28:50.992 --> 01:28:52.727
HAPPY TO REFLECT ON THAT

01:28:52.794 --> 01:28:53.928
QUESTION BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE

01:28:53.995 --> 01:28:55.863
ALL DISTRICTS PARTICIPATING IN

01:28:55.930 --> 01:28:58.032
THE PROGRAM GIVEN THAT ON

01:28:58.099 --> 01:28:59.534
AVERAGE THEY GET CENTS ON THE

01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:02.303
DOLLAR FOR PARTICIPATION BECAUSE

01:29:02.370 --> 01:29:06.674
THE PROGRAM IS SO LOW FUNDED- WE

01:29:06.741 --> 01:29:10.344
KNOW THAT THREE THOUSAND SIX

01:29:10.411 --> 01:29:11.145
HUNDRED NINETY FIVE FACULTY

01:29:11.212 --> 01:29:12.447
PARTICIPATE IN THE CURRENT

01:29:12.513 --> 01:29:15.216
PROGRAM WHAT WE DON'T KNOW. IS

01:29:15.283 --> 01:29:18.820
HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS PARTICIPATE

01:29:18.886 --> 01:29:21.622
AND OTHER HEALTH- RECEIVE

01:29:21.689 --> 01:29:23.491
HEALTHCARE THROUGH OTHER MEANS

01:29:23.558 --> 01:29:25.827
EITHER THROUGH HEALTH PROGRAM

01:29:25.893 --> 01:29:28.463
THAT IS PROVIDED BY THE DISTRICT

01:29:28.529 --> 01:29:30.064
BUT THEY JUST DON'T APPLY FOR

01:29:30.131 --> 01:29:33.201
REIMBURSEMENT. OR AS THE SHARED

01:29:33.267 --> 01:29:35.069
THROUGH THE EXCHANGE WE KNOW

01:29:35.136 --> 01:29:37.205
THAT- MANY OF OUR FACULTY

01:29:37.271 --> 01:29:40.341
COLLEAGUES- GROUPS ARE SEEKING

01:29:40.408 --> 01:29:41.976
MISINFORMATION TO TRY TO GET

01:29:42.043 --> 01:29:43.778
THAT INFORMATION AND WE'LL LOOK

01:29:43.845 --> 01:29:46.414
TO- GAINING THAT WE ALSO THINK

01:29:46.481 --> 01:29:47.782
THAT GREATER PARTICIPATION IN

01:29:47.849 --> 01:29:51.586
THIS PROGRAM. WOULD GIVE US THAT

01:29:51.652 --> 01:29:57.892
DATA POINTS. K. TWELVE. BECAUSE

01:29:57.959 --> 01:29:59.861
I THINK OUR BOTH OF YOU VERY.

01:29:59.927 --> 01:30:03.464
SAID DON'T KNOW. THIS SIR IT

01:30:03.531 --> 01:30:04.265
BECAUSE YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW

01:30:04.332 --> 01:30:06.567
HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE OUT THERE

01:30:06.634 --> 01:30:08.770
THAT NEED THIS AND WHAT THE COST

01:30:08.836 --> 01:30:12.006
IS. ONE ME ASK THERE'S THE

01:30:12.073 --> 01:30:13.708
THERE'S BEEN A DISCUSSION OF THE

01:30:13.775 --> 01:30:15.676
CURRENT PROGRAM AND HOW MUCH

01:30:15.743 --> 01:30:17.712
COAST THERE. WHAT WOULD THE

01:30:17.779 --> 01:30:20.548
OVERLAY OF THIS NEW AMOUNT TO

01:30:20.615 --> 01:30:23.584
THAT. WOULD THIS BE AN EXTENSION

01:30:23.651 --> 01:30:25.787
OF WHAT GOES TO THOSE COLLEGES

01:30:25.853 --> 01:30:27.889
TO EVERY OTHER COLLEGE WOULD IT

01:30:27.955 --> 01:30:29.323
BE MORE TO THOSE THAT ARE

01:30:29.390 --> 01:30:31.025
ALREADY PARTICIPATING AND THOSE

01:30:31.092 --> 01:30:33.694
THAT HAVEN'T. WHAT WOULD BE THE

01:30:33.761 --> 01:30:35.296
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CURRENT

01:30:35.363 --> 01:30:39.600
PROGRAM AND WHAT IS CREATED BY

01:30:39.667 --> 01:30:41.302
THIS ALLOCATION. BUT A JUMP IN

01:30:41.369 --> 01:30:43.571
SENATOR LAYERED. SO AS I

01:30:43.638 --> 01:30:45.773
MENTIONED WE ONLY ABOUT THIRTY

01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:47.341
ONE DISTRICTS AND ON THIS YEAR

01:30:47.408 --> 01:30:49.277
BUT THAT FLUCTUATES YEAR TO YEAR

01:30:49.343 --> 01:30:50.845
SO THIS YEAR WE ONLY ABOUT

01:30:50.912 --> 01:30:51.279
THIRTY ONE DISTRICTS

01:30:51.345 --> 01:30:53.514
PARTICIPATING. THE TOTAL PREMIUM

01:30:53.581 --> 01:30:57.718
COSTS WERE ON THIRTY ONE- POINT

01:30:57.785 --> 01:30:59.987
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS- AND THAT

01:31:00.054 --> 01:31:03.457
AGAIN IS- UP WITH ABOUT. LESS

01:31:03.524 --> 01:31:05.259
THAN A THIRD OF DISTRICTS

01:31:05.326 --> 01:31:07.762
PARTICIPATING AND SO WE DO THINK

01:31:07.829 --> 01:31:10.231
THAT WITH GREATER IN NUMBER OF

01:31:10.298 --> 01:31:12.600
DISTRICTS- ACTUALLY TAKING

01:31:12.667 --> 01:31:15.203
ADVANTAGE OF THIS ARE THEY TOTAL

01:31:15.269 --> 01:31:18.306
COSTS WOULD INCREASE WE ALSO.

01:31:18.372 --> 01:31:20.374
WOULD HOPING THAT THIS WOULD

01:31:20.441 --> 01:31:23.277
LEAD TO HIGHER QUALITY HEALTH

01:31:23.344 --> 01:31:27.248
BENEFITS- AND THEY WOULD BE-

01:31:27.315 --> 01:31:28.382
AGAIN THIS PROGRAM WOULD BE

01:31:28.449 --> 01:31:30.885
ELIGIBLE TO ANY DISTRICT THAT

01:31:30.952 --> 01:31:34.222
SEEKS REIMBURSEMENT. SO IT WOULD

01:31:34.288 --> 01:31:36.123
SUPPORT THOSE THAT ARE ALREADY

01:31:36.190 --> 01:31:37.959
PARTICIPATING AS WELL AS ANY

01:31:38.025 --> 01:31:40.862
NEW. DISTRICT I GET THAT BUT I

01:31:40.928 --> 01:31:42.530
CAN'T TELL IF IT SUPPORTS IN THE

01:31:42.597 --> 01:31:44.665
SAME WAY WOULD THEY BE GETTING

01:31:44.732 --> 01:31:46.200
MORE THE EXISTING DISTRICTS

01:31:46.267 --> 01:31:47.869
BECAUSE THERE'S ALLOCATION AND

01:31:47.935 --> 01:31:49.237
THEN THE LEVEL WOULD BE HIGHER

01:31:49.303 --> 01:31:51.439
FOR ALL DISTRICTS. IT IS THE

01:31:51.505 --> 01:31:53.107
PROPOSAL DETECTIVE PROGRAM THAT

01:31:53.174 --> 01:31:55.076
EXISTS FOR THE CURRENT DISTRICTS

01:31:55.142 --> 01:31:56.410
AND EXTENDED TO THE OTHER

01:31:56.477 --> 01:32:00.948
COLLEGE DISTRICTS. HOW IS THIS

01:32:01.015 --> 01:32:02.583
GOING TO WORK. SO THE PRO WILL.

01:32:02.650 --> 01:32:05.920
EXTEND TO- IT WOULD BE PROVIDED-

01:32:05.987 --> 01:32:07.788
GREATER RESOURCES TO ALL

01:32:07.855 --> 01:32:09.290
DISTRICTS THAT PARTICIPATE THOSE

01:32:09.357 --> 01:32:11.325
THAT ARE CURRENTLY ENACT SO THEY

01:32:11.392 --> 01:32:12.960
WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO GREATER

01:32:13.027 --> 01:32:16.030
RESOURCES. AS WELL AS ANY NEW

01:32:16.097 --> 01:32:18.933
DISTRICTS THAT DECIDE TO JOIN-

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.502
WITH A INVESTMENT THAT IS BEFORE

01:32:21.569 --> 01:32:23.704
YOU. DISTRICTS COULD ALSO HAVE

01:32:23.771 --> 01:32:25.606
LOCAL CONVERSATIONS THAT HAPPEN

01:32:25.673 --> 01:32:26.741
AS PART OF THEIR LOCAL

01:32:26.807 --> 01:32:28.509
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IN THEIR

01:32:28.576 --> 01:32:31.812
LOCAL CONTROL- IT TO LOOK AT

01:32:31.879 --> 01:32:35.516
BETTER QUALITY HEALTH PROGRAMS.

01:32:35.583 --> 01:32:37.551
SO THERE ARE MANY IMPROVEMENTS

01:32:37.618 --> 01:32:39.720
THAT COULD HAPPEN AS PART OF THE

01:32:39.787 --> 01:32:42.556
IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROGRAM

01:32:42.623 --> 01:32:45.092
THEN OF WHAT ME JUST MAKE

01:32:45.159 --> 01:32:48.362
STATEMENT BECAUSE- EIGHT I

01:32:48.429 --> 01:32:49.764
REALLY THINK THAT THE BOTTOM

01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:51.232
LINE OF QUESTIONING IS WE REALLY

01:32:51.299 --> 01:32:52.833
DON'T KNOW. WE DON'T KNOW HOW

01:32:52.900 --> 01:32:54.535
MANY PEOPLE NEEDED WE DON'T KNOW

01:32:54.602 --> 01:32:56.270
WHAT THE LEVEL WOULD BE. WE

01:32:56.337 --> 01:32:57.571
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ON GOING

01:32:57.638 --> 01:32:59.640
COST WOULD BE WE DON'T KNOW IF

01:32:59.707 --> 01:33:01.108
IT'S ADEQUATE FOR MEETING THE

01:33:01.175 --> 01:33:02.910
NEED FOR THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

01:33:02.977 --> 01:33:05.046
THAT ARE OUT THERE AND I THINK.

01:33:05.112 --> 01:33:06.881
AS WE HAD TO THE MAY REVISED WE

01:33:06.948 --> 01:33:08.316
WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE ANSWERS

01:33:08.382 --> 01:33:10.151
TO ALL THOSE QUESTIONS BECAUSE

01:33:10.217 --> 01:33:11.185
IF THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT

01:33:11.252 --> 01:33:13.654
PROVIDING AN ENTITLEMENT THAT AT

01:33:13.721 --> 01:33:15.923
SOME POINT WE CAN'T FIND. A HOME

01:33:15.990 --> 01:33:17.191
I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE WE

01:33:17.258 --> 01:33:18.960
COULD FIND IT SO I WOULD LIKE TO

01:33:19.026 --> 01:33:20.795
MAKE SURE WE HAVE THAT

01:33:20.861 --> 01:33:22.129
DISCUSSION AS AS WE GO INTO

01:33:22.196 --> 01:33:26.734
THIS. AND SO I THINK THAT THE

01:33:26.801 --> 01:33:29.236
WAY I INTERPRET. THE GOVERNOR'S

01:33:29.303 --> 01:33:31.339
RECOMMENDATION IT'S TO THROW A

01:33:31.405 --> 01:33:32.840
NUMBER ON THE TABLE TO START THE

01:33:32.907 --> 01:33:34.475
DISCUSSION AND SO I'M JUST

01:33:34.542 --> 01:33:36.377
HOPING THERE'S A DISCUSSION THAT

01:33:36.444 --> 01:33:38.145
GETS US TO SOME DEFINITIVE

01:33:38.212 --> 01:33:39.981
ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS BY

01:33:40.047 --> 01:33:41.782
THE TIME WE- GET TO THE MAKE

01:33:41.849 --> 01:33:44.752
REFUNDS SO LET ME JUST- ASK MY

01:33:44.819 --> 01:33:46.687
COLLEAGUES WE'VE BEEN JOINED BY

01:33:46.754 --> 01:33:51.125

APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY FROM-

01:34:02.103 --> 01:34:04.605
ALEJO OUT WE DO NEED MORE DATA

01:34:04.672 --> 01:34:06.240
ON EXACTLY WHAT THE COST OF THIS

01:34:06.307 --> 01:34:08.376
IS GOING TO BE I THINK AS A AS A

01:34:08.442 --> 01:34:10.611
MATTER OF PRINCIPLE- I THINK

01:34:10.678 --> 01:34:11.712
WE'VE TREATED OUR PART TIME

01:34:11.779 --> 01:34:13.914
INSTRUCTORS- INCREDIBLY POORLY

01:34:13.981 --> 01:34:16.951
AND- IT'S ABOUT TIME WE PROVIDED

01:34:17.018 --> 01:34:18.419
THEM WITH. HEALTHCARE WHICH AND

01:34:18.486 --> 01:34:20.121
I THINK IT'S A BASIC HUMAN RIGHT

01:34:20.187 --> 01:34:22.123
AND AS WE ALL AGREE ON IN

01:34:22.189 --> 01:34:24.392
CALIFORNIA SO- AS A MATTER OF

01:34:24.458 --> 01:34:25.626
PRINCIPLE I SUPPORT THIS

01:34:25.693 --> 01:34:26.494
OBVIOUSLY IT'S IMPORTANT

01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:27.695
UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS WILL COST

01:34:27.762 --> 01:34:32.767
US BUT- I HOPE WE GET TO THAT

01:34:32.833 --> 01:34:33.401
POINT SOONER RATHER THAN LATER.

DELIVERABLES IN THE LEGISLATION

01:42:40.587 --> 01:42:42.489

CONSIDER PROVIDING EVEN MORE

FIVE YEARS THE WILL BE. IT'S NOT

01:58:23.062 --> 01:58:26.065
ADDRESS SO THAT'S STRATEGY IS-

01:58:26.132 --> 01:58:28.234

BEYOND THE TWENTY TWO TWENTY

01:58:30.703 --> 01:58:33.139

PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING WHICH

02:07:15.694 --> 02:07:18.263

02:07:18.330 --> 02:07:20.733
BUT YOU ALSO HAVE GENERAL. FUND

02:07:20.799 --> 02:07:21.867
NONPROFIT NINETY EIGHT GENERAL

02:07:21.934 --> 02:07:24.603
FUND THAT COULD BE USED FOR THIS

02:07:24.670 --> 02:07:26.905
PURPOSE AND ALSO EXCLUDED- AND

02:07:26.972 --> 02:07:29.508
SO ANY IN A YEAR WHEN WE HAVE A

02:07:29.575 --> 02:07:31.343
BUNCH OF EDUCATION NEEDS.

02:07:31.410 --> 02:07:33.145
DRAWING FROM THE PROP NINETY

02:07:33.212 --> 02:07:34.179
EIGHT BUCKET MEANS THAT WE'RE

02:07:34.246 --> 02:07:36.048
NOT USING THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY

02:07:36.115 --> 02:07:37.516
SOME ODD MILLION DOLLARS FOR

02:07:37.583 --> 02:07:41.553
pMIGHT DEEM APPROPRIATE- AND SO

02:07:41.620 --> 02:07:42.921
THAT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN A

02:07:42.988 --> 02:07:44.156
CONSCIOUS CHOICE TO SAY WE'RE

02:07:44.223 --> 02:07:46.091
GONNA DROP THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY

02:07:46.158 --> 02:07:46.759
SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FROM PROP

DRAW FROM THE GENERAL FUND AND

THAT WOULD ALSO BE EXCLUDED FROM

02:07:51.864 --> 02:07:53.499
DOWN SO THAT THAT'S MY QUESTION

02:07:53.565 --> 02:07:55.401
BACK TO DEPARTMENT FINANCES WHAT

02:07:55.467 --> 02:07:57.836
WAS THE MOTIVATION- IF THERE WAS

02:07:57.903 --> 02:08:00.773
ANY- FOR CHOOSING TO USE PROP

02:08:00.839 --> 02:08:05.878
NINETY EIGHT FUNDS AS. OPPOSED

02:08:05.944 --> 02:08:06.478

02:08:09.648 --> 02:08:11.150
THE ON THE GAMBLING BUT MY

02:08:11.216 --> 02:08:13.519
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. PROP

02:08:13.585 --> 02:08:14.920
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT IS NOT

02:08:14.987 --> 02:08:17.256
AUTOMATICALLY EXCLUDED FROM FROM

02:08:17.322 --> 02:08:20.692
THE GET LIMIT. RATHER YOU KNOW

02:08:20.759 --> 02:08:22.327
CERTAIN STATE SUBVENTIONS LIKE

02:08:22.394 --> 02:08:23.729
THE APPORTIONMENT I BELIEVE ARE

02:08:23.796 --> 02:08:26.131
EXCLUDED FROM AGAIN LIMIT AND-

02:08:26.198 --> 02:08:28.233
AND- QUALIFIED CAPITAL OUTLAY

02:08:28.300 --> 02:08:30.035
PROJECTS SUCH AS- DEFERRED

02:08:30.102 --> 02:08:31.437
MAINTENANCE ARE EXCLUDED FROM

02:08:31.503 --> 02:08:33.105
THE GALLAGHER BUT THERE'S NOT A-

02:08:33.172 --> 02:08:35.240
RULE OF THUMB THAT PROPOSITION

02:08:35.307 --> 02:08:36.141
NINETY EIGHT EXPENDITURES ARE

02:08:36.208 --> 02:08:37.743
EXCLUDED. FROM THE GALLON AT

02:08:37.810 --> 02:08:38.210
LEAST ONCE THAT'S MY

02:08:38.277 --> 02:08:40.379
UNDERSTANDING. AND I THINK YOU

02:08:40.446 --> 02:08:42.114
KNOW TO YOUR OTHER POINT-

02:08:42.181 --> 02:08:43.215
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE HAS

02:08:43.282 --> 02:08:46.018
TRADITIONALLY BEEN. APPROPRIATED

02:08:46.085 --> 02:08:47.953
TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES UNDER YET

02:08:48.020 --> 02:08:51.423
USING. PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

02:08:51.490 --> 02:08:52.357
FUNDS AS MY- AS MY COLLEAGUE.

02:08:52.424 --> 02:08:54.493
YOU KNOW THERE IS A RATHER

02:08:54.560 --> 02:08:56.161
LARGE- INVESTMENT LAST YEAR

02:08:56.228 --> 02:08:57.696
UNDER PROPOSITION NINETY DOLLARS

02:08:57.763 --> 02:08:59.998
AND I THINK. YOU KNOW IT-

02:09:00.065 --> 02:09:01.934
ANOTHER CONSIDERATION IS THAT IF

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.002
THERE ARE NON NINETY DOLLARS

02:09:04.069 --> 02:09:04.536
THAT ARE APPROPRIATED TO

02:09:04.603 --> 02:09:06.839
COMMUNITY COLLEGES- YOU KNOW

02:09:06.905 --> 02:09:08.107
OUTSIDE OF THE PROPOSITION

02:09:08.173 --> 02:09:08.874
NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE AND THEN

02:09:08.941 --> 02:09:10.342
THERE IS A RISK OF POTENTIALLY

02:09:10.409 --> 02:09:13.245
OVER APPROPRIATING. PROPOSITION

02:09:13.312 --> 02:09:15.681
AND EAKER T. I'D BE INTERESTED

02:09:15.747 --> 02:09:17.382
LA- THOUGHT ON THAT THOUGHTS ON

02:09:17.449 --> 02:09:18.951
THAT BUT I TAKE IT THAT THE

02:09:19.017 --> 02:09:20.552
ANSWER TO MY QUESTION IS THAT

02:09:20.619 --> 02:09:21.587
THIS. WEEK WITH THE QUESTION WAS

02:09:21.653 --> 02:09:23.222
WHY DO WE CHOOSE TO USE PROP

02:09:23.288 --> 02:09:23.989
NINETY EIGHT FUNDING AS OPPOSED

02:09:24.056 --> 02:09:25.524
TO NONPROFIT INDIAN FUNDING. AND

02:09:25.591 --> 02:09:27.659
I THINK THE ANSWER HEARD WAS.

02:09:27.726 --> 02:09:28.393
BECAUSE THAT'S TRADITIONALLY THE

02:09:28.460 --> 02:09:30.362
WAY WE'VE DONE IT- BUT I WOULD

02:09:30.429 --> 02:09:31.763
ALSO POINT OUT THE TRADITIONALLY

02:09:31.830 --> 02:09:32.831
WE'VE NOT RUN OVER THE GANN

02:09:32.898 --> 02:09:35.667
LIMIT. AND SO WE HAVE A AN

02:09:35.734 --> 02:09:36.702
INTERESTING. SITUATION AN

02:09:36.768 --> 02:09:40.372
OPPORTUNITY HERE. TO INVEST NINE

02:09:40.439 --> 02:09:41.140
NINETY EIGHT FUNDING IN A WAY

02:09:41.206 --> 02:09:43.375
THAT I THINK WOULD- ALLOWS HAVE

02:09:43.442 --> 02:09:45.277
A BIGGER POT FOR EDUCATIONAL

02:09:45.344 --> 02:09:46.078
NEEDS IN AND SINCE WE'RE SITTING

02:09:46.145 --> 02:09:47.779
IN BUDGET SUB ONE. I WOULD JUST

02:09:47.846 --> 02:09:49.481
EMPHASIZE THAT THERE ARE A LOT

02:09:49.548 --> 02:09:50.782
OF NEEDS THAT AS WE DISCUSS

02:09:50.849 --> 02:09:52.885
BEFORE UNLIKE OUR COMMUNITY

02:09:52.951 --> 02:09:53.919
COLLEGES ARE. ARE K. THROUGH

02:09:53.986 --> 02:09:56.455
TWELVE. AND SO YOU KNOW I

02:09:56.522 --> 02:09:58.290
PERHAPS IT'S WISE TO USE PROP

02:09:58.357 --> 02:09:59.424
NINETY FUNDING FOR THIS BUT BUT

02:09:59.491 --> 02:10:00.959
I HAVEN'T FELT LIKE THERE'S BEEN

02:10:01.026 --> 02:10:03.028
ANY KIND OF. RATIONALE GIVEN

02:10:03.095 --> 02:10:04.163
OTHER THAN THIS IS THE WAY WE'VE

02:10:04.229 --> 02:10:05.664
DONE THINGS AND THAT MAYBE THAT

02:10:05.731 --> 02:10:06.932
MIGHT WELL BE TRUE BUT BUT WE'RE

02:10:06.999 --> 02:10:08.433
WE ARE IN AN UNUSUAL TIME AD I

02:10:08.500 --> 02:10:09.601
JUST WANT TO KNOWLEDGE THAT.

02:10:09.668 --> 02:10:11.603
YEAH WE HAVE WE WAY OVER AGAIN

02:10:11.670 --> 02:10:13.272
LIMIT AND SO WE CAN TAKE THOSE

02:10:13.338 --> 02:10:14.706
DOLLARS FROM THE NONPROFIT

02:10:14.773 --> 02:10:15.807
NINETY FUNDING AND USES FOR THIS

02:10:15.874 --> 02:10:18.143
PURPOSE. AND I THINK HAVE UNLESS

02:10:18.210 --> 02:10:19.845
ELLIE- TELLS ME I'M WRONG HERE.

02:10:19.912 --> 02:10:21.113
I HAD WHAT WAS EXPLAINED TO ME

02:10:21.180 --> 02:10:22.514
IS THAT WE WOULD HAVE A BIGGER

02:10:22.581 --> 02:10:24.082
PART OF FUNDING UPFRONT NINETY

02:10:24.149 --> 02:10:24.983
EIGHT FOR SOME OF THE OTHER

02:10:25.050 --> 02:10:25.751
NEEDS. THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING

02:10:25.817 --> 02:10:27.352
INCLUDING THE HEALTH INSURANCE

02:10:27.419 --> 02:10:29.388
FOR PART TIME FACULTY AS WELL AS

02:10:29.454 --> 02:10:30.722
SOME OF THE OTHER- PRIORITIES

02:10:30.789 --> 02:10:32.191
THAT HAVE BEEN EMPHASIZED IN THE

02:10:32.257 --> 02:10:33.959
PREVIOUS ISSUE SO. I'LL JUST

02:10:34.026 --> 02:10:36.028
MAKE A GENERAL POINT- AND I

02:10:36.094 --> 02:10:40.232
ASKED EARLIER. IF YOU HAVE ANY.

02:10:40.299 --> 02:10:41.733
FURTHER COMMENTS ON THIS. YOU'RE

02:10:41.800 --> 02:10:43.335
JUST TO POINTS FIRST- OF. I

02:10:43.402 --> 02:10:45.437
THINK WHAT THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:10:45.504 --> 02:10:48.140
FINANCE AND SAY IS THAT. THESE

02:10:48.207 --> 02:10:49.575
PROJECTS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE OR

02:10:49.641 --> 02:10:51.310
FIND IT WOULD PROPOSITION NINETY

02:10:51.376 --> 02:10:53.111
EIGHT BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE.

02:10:53.178 --> 02:10:55.080
THAT'S HOW K. FOURTEEN EDUCATION

02:10:55.147 --> 02:10:57.649
IS PRIMARILY FUNDED A AND B. THE

02:10:57.716 --> 02:10:59.885
GUARANTEE IS GROWN A GREAT DEAL

02:10:59.952 --> 02:11:02.921
AND SO THERE IS MONEY- A LOT OF

02:11:02.988 --> 02:11:05.624
DETAIL ON A ONE TIME BASIS FOR

02:11:05.691 --> 02:11:07.693
THESE KINDS OF PROJECTS. THAT

02:11:07.759 --> 02:11:09.828
SAID I THINK CENTER REMEMBER

02:11:09.895 --> 02:11:12.164
WHAT YOUR THE FACT THAT. YOU'RE

02:11:12.231 --> 02:11:14.066
HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS NOW

02:11:14.132 --> 02:11:15.901
IS REALLY IMPORTANT. BECAUSE

02:11:15.968 --> 02:11:17.869
THERE IS AN ISSUE OF EXCESS

02:11:17.936 --> 02:11:20.739
REVENUES- IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE

02:11:20.806 --> 02:11:23.075
AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO- IT'S

02:11:23.141 --> 02:11:24.543
IT IT'S IN THE BILLIONS OF

02:11:24.610 --> 02:11:26.612
DOLLARS IN EXCESS REVENUES. AND

02:11:26.678 --> 02:11:27.579
WE DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

02:11:27.646 --> 02:11:29.214
THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE THESE

02:11:29.281 --> 02:11:31.183
CONVERSATIONS NOW AND NOT WAIT

02:11:31.250 --> 02:11:33.385
UNTIL MAY REVISED TO START THOSE

02:11:33.452 --> 02:11:34.253
CONVERSATIONS HAVE THOSE

02:11:34.319 --> 02:11:36.321
CONVERSATIONS NOW DISCUSS WHAT

02:11:36.388 --> 02:11:38.023
OUR OPTIONS ARE WHAT'S THE BEST.

02:11:38.090 --> 02:11:41.026
WAY FORWARD TO TRY TO- ADDRESSES

02:11:41.093 --> 02:11:44.096

YOU MISTER SHE HAS AN AND I JUST

02:11:45.364 --> 02:11:47.633
CLOSE BY SAYING- I'M NOT OPPOSE

02:11:47.699 --> 02:11:48.834
THE USE OF PROP NINETY EIGHT

02:11:48.900 --> 02:11:50.769
FUNDING FOR THIS PURPOSE- BUT

02:11:50.836 --> 02:11:52.838
I'D LIKE TO SEE MORE RATIONALE.

02:11:52.904 --> 02:11:54.740
AND EXPLANATION FOR WHY WE'RE

02:11:54.806 --> 02:11:55.374
MAKING THIS CHOICE BECAUSE IT IS

02:11:55.440 --> 02:11:57.142
A CHOICE WE'RE MAKING. AND WE

02:11:57.209 --> 02:11:58.510
ARE IN A UNIQUE POSITION WE HAVE

02:11:58.577 --> 02:12:00.746
A LARGE SURPLUS THIS YEAR AND

02:12:00.812 --> 02:12:01.947
WE'RE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

02:12:02.014 --> 02:12:02.514
DIVIDE THAT INTO DIFFERENT

02:12:02.581 --> 02:12:05.250
PRIORITIES- BY. CHOOSING TO BE

02:12:05.317 --> 02:12:06.285
USED AS PART NINETY FUNDING

02:12:06.351 --> 02:12:07.953
MEANS THAT WE'RE NECESSARILY

02:12:08.020 --> 02:12:09.388
TAKING AWAY PROP NINETY FUNDING

02:12:09.454 --> 02:12:11.290
FOR OTHER PURPOSES SO I WOULD

02:12:11.356 --> 02:12:12.190
JUST LIKE TO SEE MORE

02:12:12.257 --> 02:12:14.326
EXPLANATION FOR WHY WE HAVE MADE

02:12:14.393 --> 02:12:15.327
BY THE GOVERNMENT THAT CHOICE.

02:12:15.394 --> 02:12:16.795
AND WHY THE LEGISLATURE TO GO

02:12:16.862 --> 02:12:18.563
ALONG WITH THAT THANK YOU. THANK

02:12:18.630 --> 02:12:20.365
YOU AND LET ME JUST SAY IN

02:12:20.432 --> 02:12:21.533
CLOSING ON THE SIDE OF MY

02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:24.169
APPRECIATE QUESTIONS OF BOTH MY

02:12:24.236 --> 02:12:25.837
COLLEAGUES I THINK THEY REALLY.

02:12:25.904 --> 02:12:27.506
A HIGHLIGHTED IT AND I AGREE

02:12:27.572 --> 02:12:29.107
WITH THE SUGGESTION THAT WE

02:12:29.174 --> 02:12:30.809
SHOULD HAVE CONVERSATIONS OUT OF

02:12:30.876 --> 02:12:32.978
THIS BECAUSE- OF THERE'S A

02:12:33.045 --> 02:12:34.613
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO GO

02:12:34.680 --> 02:12:36.581
AND I WOULD JUST RENEW. MY

02:12:36.648 --> 02:12:38.350
COMMENT FROM A PREVIOUS ITEMS

02:12:38.417 --> 02:12:39.818
THAT I THINK HISTORICALLY PEOPLE

02:12:39.885 --> 02:12:41.386
THOUGHT COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE

02:12:41.453 --> 02:12:43.021
DIFFERENT THAN CSU AND UC

02:12:43.088 --> 02:12:44.423
BECAUSE THEY HAVE LOCAL BONDING

02:12:44.489 --> 02:12:46.525
AUTHORITY BUT I THINK. OUR

02:12:46.591 --> 02:12:48.794
CHANGES TO MAKE THE COMMUNITY

02:12:48.860 --> 02:12:51.630
COLLEGES LESS COMMUNITY HAS LED

02:12:51.697 --> 02:12:54.766
TO LESS. APPROVAL OF THOSE BOND

02:12:54.833 --> 02:12:57.035
MEASURES AND SO I HOPE THAT THE

02:12:57.102 --> 02:13:00.038
DISCUSSION WE JUST HAD WILL LEAD

02:13:00.105 --> 02:13:02.507
TO SOME ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. ON

02:13:02.574 --> 02:13:04.843
THIS AS WE HEAD TOWARD THE MAY

02:13:04.910 --> 02:13:09.748
REVISE. OR WITH THAT WE'RE GOING

02:13:09.815 --> 02:13:11.149
TO MOVE. A TWO THE GLASS OF OUR

02:13:11.216 --> 02:13:13.952
AGE ISSUES AND WE- ARE. GOING TO

02:13:14.019 --> 02:13:16.321

OVERVIEW OF WHERE CALIFORNIA WE

02:13:41.780 --> 02:13:45.150
COLLEGES ARE IN STUDENT HOUSING.

02:13:45.217 --> 02:13:46.418
PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC

02:13:46.485 --> 02:13:48.553
APPROXIMATELY 60% OF COLLEGE

EXPENSES. I SHARE THIS IS

02:14:08.573 --> 02:14:09.875
IMPORTANT CONTEXT IN THE WAY

02:14:09.941 --> 02:14:11.576
THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE

02:14:11.643 --> 02:14:13.378
APPROACHING HOUSING WHICH IS

02:14:13.445 --> 02:14:16.281
VERY DISTINCT FROM- AND IN SOME

WELL KNOW THAT THEY BURKE

02:23:59.797 --> 02:24:01.032
COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S

02:24:01.099 --> 02:24:02.233
OFFICE DOESN'T PROVIDE THE

02:24:02.300 --> 02:24:03.735
INDIVIDUAL HOUSING BUT I ALSO

02:24:03.801 --> 02:24:05.236

FROM ALL THE DECENTRALIZED.

02:24:08.873 --> 02:24:10.508
CAMPUSES AND THAT IS AN

02:24:10.575 --> 02:24:14.045
IMPORTANT ROLE IN THIS IN AND

02:24:14.112 --> 02:24:16.014
AGREEING WITH SENATOR MAN.

02:24:16.080 --> 02:24:17.648
THAT'S MY EIGHT YEARS ON A

02:24:17.715 --> 02:24:18.983
COMMUNITY COLLEGE BOARD WHICH

02:24:19.050 --> 02:24:20.818
ENDED WHEN I CAME INTO THE

02:24:20.885 --> 02:24:22.887
LEGISLATURE TWENTY YEARS AGO. IT

02:24:22.954 --> 02:24:24.222
NEVER OCCURRED TO US THAT PEOPLE

02:24:24.288 --> 02:24:26.024
WOULD BE HOMELESS THIS WAS WHERE

02:24:26.090 --> 02:24:27.125
PEOPLE WERE LIVING WITH THEIR

02:24:27.191 --> 02:24:29.293
FAMILIES AND THE COMMUNITIES

02:24:29.360 --> 02:24:29.861
GENERALLY WHERE THEY WERE

02:24:29.927 --> 02:24:32.296
RAISED. HIM THE WHOLE NOTION

02:24:32.363 --> 02:24:35.199
THAT NOW I GO TO THE COMMUNITY

02:24:35.266 --> 02:24:38.036
COLLEGE DISTRICT'S. CAMPUSES IN

02:24:38.102 --> 02:24:40.638
MY DISTRICT AND AMEND TOLD THE

02:24:40.705 --> 02:24:42.507
325% OR HOMELESS AND THERE'S A

02:24:42.573 --> 02:24:44.475
MUCH HIGHER PERCENT OF HOUSING

02:24:44.542 --> 02:24:46.811
IN SECURITY. IS SOMETHING THAT

02:24:46.878 --> 02:24:48.846
IS A CHANGE THAT IS DEVELOPED

02:24:48.913 --> 02:24:51.983
AND IT IT FITS WITH THE EARLIER

02:24:52.050 --> 02:24:53.484
DISCUSSION ABOUT THE FACT THAT

02:24:53.551 --> 02:24:55.186
WE CAN'T HAVE A THING IN THE

02:24:55.253 --> 02:24:56.821
FUNDING FORMULA ABOUT THE COST

02:24:56.888 --> 02:24:58.256
OF LIVING BECAUSE THE COST OF

02:24:58.322 --> 02:25:00.591
LIVING IS LEADING TO THAT IN

02:25:00.658 --> 02:25:04.228
SOME OF THESE. ARE AREAS AND AS

02:25:04.295 --> 02:25:06.964
A RESULT THIS IS NOT A USUAL

02:25:07.031 --> 02:25:08.466
THING FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO

02:25:08.533 --> 02:25:10.735
DO THE- ONE CENTER ROAD SHOW

02:25:10.802 --> 02:25:12.403
ABOVE MENTIONED LAND AND

02:25:12.470 --> 02:25:15.206
CONSTRUCTION COSTS- I THINK

02:25:15.273 --> 02:25:16.441
THERE ARE MANY COMMUNITY

02:25:16.507 --> 02:25:18.409
COLLEGES THAT HAVE LAND I.

02:25:18.476 --> 02:25:20.812
VISITED QUEST NORTHERN ST LOUIS

02:25:20.878 --> 02:25:22.947
OBISPO COUNTY JUST TEN DAYS AGO.

02:25:23.014 --> 02:25:24.882
THEY HAD LAND THAT THAT THAT

02:25:24.949 --> 02:25:26.150
THEY COULD DO BUT THIS IS JUST

02:25:26.217 --> 02:25:27.785
NOT ANYTHING THAT HISTORICALLY

02:25:27.852 --> 02:25:29.654
HAS EVER BEEN DONE. OUT WITH THE

02:25:29.720 --> 02:25:31.389
EXCEPTION OF A FEW COLLEGES THAT

02:25:31.456 --> 02:25:33.291
I THINK ARE LARGELY RURAL AND

02:25:33.357 --> 02:25:34.759
HAVE PEOPLE COMING FROM WAY FAR

02:25:34.826 --> 02:25:41.499
AWAY AT THE TRIED. TO

02:25:41.566 --> 02:25:43.167
ACCOMMODATE IT AND SO. THIS IS

02:25:43.234 --> 02:25:44.235
NO. AND THIS IS NOT WHAT A LOT

02:25:44.302 --> 02:25:46.304
OF CA COLLEGES WAS OF THEIR- AND

02:25:46.370 --> 02:25:49.107
YET. I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT

02:25:49.173 --> 02:25:50.708
THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE SAID

02:25:50.775 --> 02:25:52.677
THEY WANT SUPPORTS. BUT THE

02:25:52.743 --> 02:25:54.479
BASIC NEED FOR HOUSING IS THE

02:25:54.545 --> 02:25:56.414
IMPORTANT THING AND I HOPE THE

02:25:56.481 --> 02:25:58.449
SUPPORTS DOESN'T TURN OUT TO BE

02:25:58.516 --> 02:26:00.184
A LIMITER IN SOME WAYS BECAUSE-

02:26:00.251 --> 02:26:02.520
EVEN THOUGH I WOULD LOVE TO SEE

02:26:02.587 --> 02:26:04.322
IT FOR EVERY STUDENT IS HOUSED.

02:26:04.388 --> 02:26:07.425
THE PRIORITY IS TO MAKE SURE THE

02:26:07.492 --> 02:26:09.193
HOUSING HAPPENED AND THIS IS.

02:26:09.260 --> 02:26:10.962
OUR THIRD HEARING FOR THE

02:26:11.028 --> 02:26:12.930
BRANCHES OF HIGHER EDUCATION WE

02:26:12.997 --> 02:26:15.099
HAVE HEARD FROM CSU. WE HAVE

02:26:15.166 --> 02:26:17.735

02:26:22.940 --> 02:26:25.476
OUT OF MONEY FROM THIS RIGHT

FIRST ROUND OF. OF HOUSING MONEY

02:26:28.412 --> 02:26:30.181
THAT WAS IN THE BUDGET LAST YEAR

02:26:30.248 --> 02:26:31.349
MOST TO BE SPREAD OVER THREE

02:26:31.415 --> 02:26:33.751
YEARS. AND EVERY SINGLE SYSTEM

02:26:33.818 --> 02:26:35.820
IS HOPELESSLY OVER SUBSCRIBED IN

02:26:35.887 --> 02:26:38.289
WHAT THE DEMAND IS AGAINST WHAT

02:26:38.356 --> 02:26:40.024
WAS APPROPRIATED LAST YEAR SO I

02:26:40.091 --> 02:26:44.962
THINK THAT. EVEN THOUGH WE ARE-

02:26:45.029 --> 02:26:47.632
WHAT ARE THE L. A- WENT. AND

02:26:47.698 --> 02:26:49.600

TIME EXPENDITURES THAT ARE

02:27:00.311 --> 02:27:02.446
RECURRING AND THIS WOULD BE ONE

02:27:02.513 --> 02:27:06.017
SO IF THERE IS AN ISSUE. OF FOR

02:27:06.083 --> 02:27:07.485
ADDING AND TRYING TO PICK IT UP

02:27:07.552 --> 02:27:10.555
. A AND AS I SAID BEFORE THIS IS

02:27:10.621 --> 02:27:12.256
THE SAME THING AS DEFERRED

SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO DO SO. I

02:27:19.897 --> 02:27:22.233
