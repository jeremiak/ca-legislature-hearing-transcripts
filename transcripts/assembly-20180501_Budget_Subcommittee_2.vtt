ANALYST'S OFFICE.

00:42:07.858 --> 00:42:09.293
THE GOVERNOR'S PURPOSE FOR

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:11.962
TREATING THESE LEARNING LABS O.

00:42:12.029 --> 00:42:13.030
TO WHICH IS TO INCREASE THE

00:42:13.097 --> 00:42:13.931
NUMBER OF STUDENTS FROM

00:42:13.998 --> 00:42:15.532
HISTORICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED

00:42:15.599 --> 00:42:17.001
GROUPS THAT EARNED STAND

00:42:17.067 --> 00:42:18.502
BACHELOR'S DEGREES. IS AN

00:42:18.569 --> 00:42:20.404
IMPORTANT GOAL THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:42:20.471 --> 00:42:22.940
FINANCE JUST CITED SOME DATA ON

00:42:23.007 --> 00:42:24.541
HOW STUDENTS FROM HISTORICALLY

00:42:24.608 --> 00:42:27.111
UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS. HAVE A

00:42:27.177 --> 00:42:29.079
LOWER STANDARD ROMAN PERSISTENCE

00:42:29.146 --> 00:42:30.714
IN COMPLETION RATES THAN

00:42:30.781 --> 00:42:32.850
STUDENTS FROM OTHER GROUPS.

00:42:32.917 --> 00:42:34.084
THAT SAID WE HAVE SEVERAL

00:42:34.151 --> 00:42:36.186
CONCERNS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S

00:42:36.253 --> 00:42:37.721
PROPOSAL.

00:42:37.788 --> 00:42:39.456
FIRST RESEARCH IDENTIFIES A

00:42:39.523 --> 00:42:40.991
NUMBER OF REASONS

00:42:41.058 --> 00:42:43.027
FOR LOWER PARTICIPATION AND

00:42:43.093 --> 00:42:44.328
SUCCESS RATES AMONG STUDENTS

00:42:44.395 --> 00:42:46.730
FROM CERTAIN GROUPS.

00:42:46.797 --> 00:42:48.165
THESE REASONS INCLUDE

00:42:48.232 --> 00:42:49.900
DISPROPORTIONATE ATTENDANCE AT

00:42:49.967 --> 00:42:51.969
K. TWELVE SCHOOLS WITH LESS

00:42:52.036 --> 00:42:53.671
QUALIFIED MATH AND SCIENCE

00:42:53.737 --> 00:42:55.105
TEACHERS.

00:42:55.172 --> 00:42:56.340
I AND LESS ACCESS TO ADVANCED

00:42:56.407 --> 00:42:57.074
COURSES.

00:42:57.141 --> 00:42:59.276
.

00:42:59.343 --> 00:43:00.210
LACK OF IT ANOTHER REASON IS

00:43:00.277 --> 00:43:02.346
LACK OF EXPOSURE TO ROLE MODELS

00:43:02.413 --> 00:43:03.647
OR MENTORS WHO WORK IN STEM

00:43:03.714 --> 00:43:06.083
FIELDS OTHER. REASONS FOR

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:08.652
DISPARITIES ARE COULD. INCLUDE

00:43:08.719 --> 00:43:10.287
PARENTAL EXPECTATIONS

00:43:10.354 --> 00:43:11.755
AND THE FACT THAT STEM DEGREES

00:43:11.822 --> 00:43:13.490
SUCH AS ENGINEERING OFTEN

00:43:13.557 --> 00:43:15.759
REQUIRE MORE THAN THE TYPICAL

00:43:15.826 --> 00:43:17.328
HUNDRED TWENTY UNIT A DEGREE

00:43:17.394 --> 00:43:19.096
REQUIREMENTS WHICH SERVES AS AN

00:43:19.163 --> 00:43:20.331
ADDED BURDEN TO LOWER INCOME

00:43:20.397 --> 00:43:21.732
STUDENTS.

00:43:21.799 --> 00:43:25.469
TO PURSUE THESE DEGREES.

00:43:25.536 --> 00:43:27.004
GIVEN THESE UNDERLYING CAUSES

00:43:27.071 --> 00:43:29.206
IT'S UNCLEAR TO US HOW THE

00:43:29.273 --> 00:43:30.874
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED SOLUTION

00:43:30.941 --> 00:43:33.477
ONLINE AND HYBRID COURSES THAT

00:43:33.544 --> 00:43:34.778
USE LEARNING SCIENCE WILL

00:43:34.845 --> 00:43:36.180
ADDRESS.

00:43:36.246 --> 00:43:36.914
THESE DISPARITIES IN A

00:43:36.981 --> 00:43:39.516
MEANINGFUL WAY.

00:43:39.583 --> 00:43:41.051
SECOND THOUGH ENROLLMENT IN

00:43:41.118 --> 00:43:42.353
ONLINE COURSES HAS BEEN

00:43:42.419 --> 00:43:43.654
INCREASING OVER THE YEARS AT

00:43:43.721 --> 00:43:45.689
COMMUNITY COLLEGES CAL STATE

00:43:45.756 --> 00:43:47.891
UNIVERSITY AND YOU SEE. THE VAST

00:43:47.958 --> 00:43:49.626
MAJORITY OF STUDENTS CONTINUE TO

00:43:49.693 --> 00:43:51.161
TAKE THEIR COURSES IN A FACE TO

00:43:51.228 --> 00:43:52.730
FACE ENVIRONMENT.

00:43:52.796 --> 00:43:54.965
IT'S UNCLEAR THEN HOW CREATING

00:43:55.032 --> 00:43:56.533
REDESIGNING ONLINE AND HYBRID

00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:58.235
COURSES.

00:43:58.302 --> 00:43:59.336
WOULD RESULT IN A WIDESPREAD

00:43:59.403 --> 00:44:00.604
IMPACT

00:44:00.671 --> 00:44:03.107
AND IMPROVEMENT.

00:44:03.173 --> 00:44:04.775
THIRD AS YOUR AGENDA NOTES ON

00:44:04.842 --> 00:44:07.211
PAGES TWENTY SEVEN TO TWENTY

00:44:07.277 --> 00:44:09.413
EIGHT. THE STATE ALREADY FUNDS

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:10.347
ONLINE INITIATIVES THAT EACH

00:44:10.414 --> 00:44:11.849
SEGMENT.

00:44:11.915 --> 00:44:14.351
AND THESE INITIATIVES ALL FOCUS

00:44:14.418 --> 00:44:15.886
ON CREATING AND DESIGNING.

00:44:15.953 --> 00:44:17.788
ONLINE AND HYBRID COURSES AT THE

00:44:17.855 --> 00:44:19.189
LOWER DIVISION LEVEL SO AS TO

00:44:19.256 --> 00:44:21.191
INCREASE STUDENT LEARNING.

00:44:21.258 --> 00:44:22.393
GIVEN THAT IT'S UNCLEAR TO US

00:44:22.459 --> 00:44:23.527
WHY THE STATE NEEDS ANOTHER

00:44:23.594 --> 00:44:25.729
STATE FUNDED PROGRAM THAT ALSO

00:44:25.796 --> 00:44:27.798
FOCUSES ON CREATING INNOVATIVE

00:44:27.865 --> 00:44:30.267
LOWER DIVISION COURSES.

00:44:30.334 --> 00:44:32.503
FOR IF THE PROPOSAL REALLY JUST

00:44:32.569 --> 00:44:34.004
LACKS THE JUSTIFICATION OVERALL

00:44:34.071 --> 00:44:35.806
JUSTIFICATION FOR THE PROPOSED

00:44:35.873 --> 00:44:37.341
FUNDING LEVEL TEN MILLION

00:44:37.408 --> 00:44:40.010
DOLLARS A YEAR ON GOING.

00:44:40.077 --> 00:44:41.812
AND HOW SUCH AN AMOUNT WOULD

00:44:41.879 --> 00:44:43.981
ACHIEVE PROGRAM OBJECTIVES.

00:44:44.048 --> 00:44:45.783
SO WE RECOMMEND.

00:44:45.849 --> 00:44:47.451
THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THE

00:44:47.518 --> 00:44:49.053
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL.

00:44:49.119 --> 00:44:50.788
INSTEAD THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT

00:44:50.854 --> 00:44:51.989
WANT TO TAKE SOME TIME TO

00:44:52.056 --> 00:44:54.191
IDENTIFY THE ROOT CAUSES.

00:44:54.258 --> 00:44:56.060
OF STEM DISPARITIES AFTER THREE

00:44:56.126 --> 00:44:58.729
SEGMENTS AND BASED ON WHAT I IS

00:44:58.796 --> 00:45:00.931
IDENTIFIED. OF THE STATE COULD

00:45:00.998 --> 00:45:03.167
CRAFT SOLUTIONS THAT ARE EITHER

00:45:03.233 --> 00:45:04.401
TAILORED TO THE SPECIFIC

00:45:04.468 --> 00:45:06.036
SEGMENTS.

00:45:06.103 --> 00:45:07.271
OR IT COULD BE INTERSECTING AT

00:45:07.337 --> 00:45:08.372
ALL OR INVOLVED THE K. TWELVE

00:45:08.439 --> 00:45:10.140
SYSTEM.

00:45:10.207 --> 00:45:11.909
THANK YOU AND HAPPY DANCERS.

00:45:11.975 --> 00:45:14.978
OKAY.

00:45:15.045 --> 00:45:18.615
QUESTIONS.

00:45:18.682 --> 00:45:25.122
CHAVEZ.

00:45:25.189 --> 00:45:27.291
IN ARE KNOW ONLINE EDUCATION AND

00:45:27.357 --> 00:45:28.692
STEM YOU KNOW THOSE ARE THE

SHINY OBJECTS OF EDUCATION

00:45:29.293 --> 00:45:30.661
TODAY.

00:45:30.727 --> 00:45:32.396
BUT.

00:45:32.463 --> 00:45:33.330
FROM AN ORGANIZATIONAL

00:45:33.397 --> 00:45:36.600
STANDPOINT.

00:45:36.667 --> 00:45:38.402
THE COR COM RECEIVE EDUCATION

00:45:38.469 --> 00:45:40.671
THE STATE AS WE SET UP HAS SET

00:45:40.737 --> 00:45:42.840
IT UP IS INDIA. KATIE TWELVE

00:45:42.906 --> 00:45:44.408
SYSTEM.

00:45:44.475 --> 00:45:45.776
YOU KNOW THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES

00:45:45.843 --> 00:45:48.011
A C. ISSUES IN THE UC'S.

00:45:48.078 --> 00:45:50.714
WE.

00:45:50.781 --> 00:45:51.815
WHAT CHART COR COM TO SEE IN

00:45:51.882 --> 00:45:53.150
THIS I DON'T I DON'T SEE WHY

00:45:53.217 --> 00:45:55.152
WE'RE DOING THIS?

00:45:55.219 --> 00:45:56.653
BUT WHY YOU TAKEN LEAD IN THIS

00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:57.955
WE'RE IDEA OF INSTITUTIONS.

00:45:58.021 --> 00:46:00.424
THAT ARE TAKEN LEAD IN THIS.

00:46:00.491 --> 00:46:02.025
IT'S ARE QUESTIONS CHAVEZ OTHER

00:46:02.092 --> 00:46:03.393
REASON WORK IN THE STATE'S

00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:04.027
TRYING TO TAKE THE LEAD IN THIS

00:46:04.094 --> 00:46:05.762
AREA. IS BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THERE

00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:07.397
IN INDIVIDUAL SEGMENTS HAVE

00:46:07.464 --> 00:46:08.866
THEIR OWN ONLINE EDUCATION STEM

FOCUSING ON LEARNING SCIENCE

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:30.821
EACH SEGMENT HAS ITS OWN

00:46:30.888 --> 00:46:32.156
DEVELOPMENT AS THE EARLIER NOTED

00:46:32.222 --> 00:46:33.624
HAS ITS OWN. PROGRAM FOR

AT SEGMENTS THAT ARE DEDICATED

00:46:52.342 --> 00:46:53.410
TO. ASSISTANCE ACCESS.

00:46:53.477 --> 00:46:55.245
BUT THE STATE HAS A ROLE HERE IN

00:46:55.312 --> 00:46:56.747
CLARA AND FOSTER COLLABORATION

00:46:56.813 --> 00:46:58.415
BETWEEN THE SEGMENTS AND OUT

INSTRUCTION.

00:47:11.728 --> 00:47:13.864
YEAH I.

00:47:13.931 --> 00:47:15.699
I'M SURE IF WE HAD THE.

00:47:15.766 --> 00:47:18.335
TOM TORTURE NOT HERE WE HAD

IN THE GOVERNOR'S THE GOVERNOR

00:47:27.277 --> 00:47:29.179
HE'S EXECUTIVE BEGINNING CALM

00:47:29.246 --> 00:47:30.514
UNDOCUMENTED ON THE WANTS TO.

00:47:30.581 --> 00:47:32.416
BUT TO FORM AN ORGANIZATION TO

00:47:32.482 --> 00:47:34.117
DO THIS.

00:47:34.184 --> 00:47:35.552
TO ME DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF

00:47:35.619 --> 00:47:35.819
SENSE AND.

00:47:35.886 --> 00:47:37.854
.

00:47:37.921 --> 00:47:39.456

THROUGH EACH CONCERN YOUR HONOR

01:09:01.604 --> 01:09:03.105
THE FIRST CONCERN IS.

01:09:03.172 --> 01:09:05.941
THAT THE STATE ALREADY SPENDS

01:09:06.008 --> 01:09:07.676
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON EDUCATION

01:09:07.743 --> 01:09:08.911
AND ADULT EDUCATION THROUGH

01:09:08.978 --> 01:09:10.212
THINGS LIKE THE LOCAL CONTROL

01:09:10.279 --> 01:09:11.547
FUNDING FORMULA.

01:09:11.614 --> 01:09:13.048
DON'T EDUCATION THROUGH.

01:09:13.115 --> 01:09:14.750
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES

01:09:14.817 --> 01:09:16.886
APPORTIONMENT OF PORTION MINTS

ADULT EDUCATION BLOCK GRANTS.

01:09:19.522 --> 01:09:21.090
SO WASN'T CLEAR TO US WANNA AN

01:09:21.156 --> 01:09:22.424
ADDITIONAL AUGMENTATION OF A FEW

01:09:22.491 --> 01:09:23.425

THIS SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF

01:09:26.695 --> 01:09:28.597
SPENDING ALREADY.

01:09:28.664 --> 01:09:30.666
SECONDLY OTHER LOCAL LIBRARY

01:09:30.733 --> 01:09:32.067
PROGRAMS DON'T APPEAR TO BE

01:09:32.134 --> 01:09:33.435
NECESSARILY WELL COORDINATED

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:35.170
WITH EXISTING STATE EFFORTS.

01:09:35.237 --> 01:09:36.272
FOR EXAMPLE EXISTING LAW

01:09:36.338 --> 01:09:38.908
ENCOURAGES LOCAL LIBRARIES TO A

01:09:38.974 --> 01:09:40.342

THEIR INVOLVEMENT WITH LOCAL

01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:56.125

01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:57.626
THIRD THE STATE ALSO LACKS A

OF INTEREST IN.

01:34:34.902 --> 01:34:38.039

01:34:47.882 --> 01:34:49.116
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS

01:34:49.183 --> 01:34:50.384
MENTIONED IN THE COMMENTS WAS

01:34:50.451 --> 01:34:51.952
THAT THERE WAS.

01:34:52.019 --> 01:34:54.455
AND INTEND TO INSTITUTIONALIZE

01:34:54.522 --> 01:34:56.257
BEST PRACTICES.

01:34:56.323 --> 01:34:58.192
WHAT FROM BOTH A THING FOR ALL

01:34:58.259 --> 01:35:00.361
THREE ENTITIES WHAT WHAT CAN WE

01:35:00.428 --> 01:35:02.363
EXPECT THAT TO LOOK LIKE IN THE

01:35:02.430 --> 01:35:04.065
FUTURE AS IF THIS PROBLEM

01:35:04.131 --> 01:35:05.599
CONTINUES TO GROW AS THAT THAT

01:35:05.666 --> 01:35:07.768

TWO POINT ONE MILLION STUDENTS.

01:35:20.414 --> 01:35:22.516

01:35:22.583 --> 01:35:24.718
THAT WE HELP OUR COLLEGES GET

01:35:24.785 --> 01:35:25.953

01:35:28.155 --> 01:35:30.524

01:35:30.591 --> 01:35:33.561
CREATING MO USE WITH THE COUNTY.

THE COUNTIES.

01:35:42.036 --> 01:35:45.239
OF OUR SYSTEM IT IS GOVERNED ON

01:35:45.306 --> 01:35:46.774
IN PART BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:35:46.841 --> 01:35:48.509
WHICH MEANS DECISIONS HAPPEN

01:35:48.576 --> 01:35:50.778
LOCALLY ABOUT WHAT RESOURCES

01:35:50.845 --> 01:35:51.378

JURISDICTION TO. TO MAKE THEM DO

01:35:59.820 --> 01:36:00.287
THAT BUT THE COLLEGES HAVE

01:36:00.354 --> 01:36:01.122
SHOWN.

01:36:01.188 --> 01:36:03.891
EXTREME WILLINGNESS TO PARTNER

01:36:03.958 --> 01:36:06.160
WITH THOSE EXTERNAL ENTITIES AND

01:36:06.227 --> 01:36:08.195
TO TO CREATE PROCESS HE'S AS

01:36:08.262 --> 01:36:09.463
PART OF THEIR FINANCIAL AID

01:36:09.530 --> 01:36:11.031
PROCESS AS PART OF THE

01:36:11.098 --> 01:36:12.900
ENROLLMENT PROCESS. AND SO FOR

01:36:12.967 --> 01:36:15.102
US THAT'S WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE

01:36:15.169 --> 01:36:16.871
IN TERMS OF INSTITUTIONALIZING

01:36:16.937 --> 01:36:18.739
THE WORK. FIGHT I CAN'T SAY THAT

01:36:18.806 --> 01:36:19.940
IT WILL HAPPEN AT A HUNDRED AND

01:36:20.007 --> 01:36:21.275
FOURTEEN COLLEGES BUT WE

01:36:21.342 --> 01:36:22.743
CERTAINLY HAVE HEARD FROM MANY

01:36:22.810 --> 01:36:23.711
MANY FOLKS.

WHO HAVE EXPRESSED INTEREST IN

01:36:25.713 --> 01:36:27.548
THAT AND THEN ALSO LOOKING AT

IN THE CAPITAL.

01:36:43.998 --> 01:36:45.232
I THINK ONE OF THE CONVERSATIONS

01:36:45.299 --> 01:36:46.367
THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH IS THE

01:36:46.433 --> 01:36:48.602
FACT THAT THIS PROBLEM ISN'T

01:36:48.669 --> 01:36:49.503
GOING TO GO ANYWHERE AND IT'S

01:36:49.570 --> 01:36:51.372
AND ONLY GONNA GET WORSE WITH

01:36:51.438 --> 01:36:52.173
THE INCREASED COST OF LIVING IN

01:36:52.239 --> 01:36:53.874
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:36:53.941 --> 01:36:55.109
AND THE FACT THAT FUTURE

01:36:55.176 --> 01:36:57.178
GENERATIONS OF STUDENTS CANNOT

01:36:57.244 --> 01:36:59.380
CONTINUE TO COME INTO EITHER THE

01:36:59.446 --> 01:37:00.881
COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM THE CSU

01:37:00.948 --> 01:37:02.449
SYSTEM ARE THE UC SYSTEM OR THE

01:37:02.516 --> 01:37:04.018
PRIVATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM.

01:37:04.084 --> 01:37:05.553
WITHOUT BEING INTRODUCED AND

01:37:05.619 --> 01:37:07.755
TRAINED AND PREPARED FOR THE

01:37:07.821 --> 01:37:09.123
BASIC NEEDS EXPERIENCE OF THE

01:37:09.190 --> 01:37:10.591
COLLEGE EXPERIENCE.

01:37:10.658 --> 01:37:11.692
TOO MANY STUDENTS RIGHT NOW

01:37:11.759 --> 01:37:13.961
CALIFORNIA HAVE NEVER SEEN A

01:37:14.028 --> 01:37:15.896
FINANCIAL AID PACKAGE UNTIL THEY

01:37:15.963 --> 01:37:17.698
GET THEIR FINANCIAL AID PACKAGE

01:37:17.765 --> 01:37:20.434
WHEN THE GET INTO COLLEGE.

01:37:20.501 --> 01:37:21.969
ODD TOO MANY STUDENTS RIGHT NOW

01:37:22.036 --> 01:37:23.804
HAVE NEVER HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:37:23.871 --> 01:37:26.273
THINK THROUGH HOW DO I CREATE MY

01:37:26.340 --> 01:37:28.042
BUDGET AS A COLLEGE STUDENT.

01:37:28.108 --> 01:37:29.443
IF I GET FINANCIAL AID WHAT IS

01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:30.778
THAT LOOK LIKE IF I DON'T GET

01:37:30.844 --> 01:37:31.979
FINANCIAL AID WHAT DOES THAT

01:37:32.046 --> 01:37:33.914
LOOK LIKE AND THEN IN THE

01:37:33.981 --> 01:37:35.416
COLLEGES THAT I'M APPLYING FOR

01:37:35.482 --> 01:37:36.951
WHICH THE COST OF LIVING IN THAT

01:37:37.017 --> 01:37:39.019
AREA AND HOW DO I COME PREPARED.

01:37:39.086 --> 01:37:40.821
TO BE IN THAT AREA AND THE WAY

01:37:40.888 --> 01:37:41.455
THAT I CAN TAKE CARE OF MY BASIC

01:37:41.522 --> 01:37:42.523
NEEDS.

01:37:42.590 --> 01:37:44.458
YES CAL FRESH IS A HUGE ONE

01:37:44.525 --> 01:37:46.694
RIGHT NOW BECAUSE HISTORICALLY

01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:48.128
COLLEGE STUDENTS HAVE BEEN BEEN

01:37:48.195 --> 01:37:49.663
ACTIVATED FOR THE CALIFORNIA

01:37:49.730 --> 01:37:51.298
CONVERSATION AND CAL FRESH IS

01:37:51.365 --> 01:37:52.733
SOMETHING THAT ALL THREE SYSTEMS

01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:54.368
ARE PRIORITIZING. BECAUSE THE

01:37:54.435 --> 01:37:56.203
SIZE OF MOST SUSTAINABLE WAY OF

01:37:56.270 --> 01:37:57.871
MAKING SURE THAT STUDENTS HAVE

01:37:57.938 --> 01:37:59.673
THE RESOURCES TO BUY GROCERIES

01:37:59.740 --> 01:38:00.241
TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES.

01:38:00.307 --> 01:38:02.076
BUT.

01:38:02.142 --> 01:38:03.844
PART OF THAT CONVERSATION CAN

01:38:03.911 --> 01:38:07.414
HAPPEN. ONCE THEY'RE IN COLLEGE.

01:38:07.481 --> 01:38:08.449
ALL OF THESE BASIC NEEDS

01:38:08.515 --> 01:38:10.017
STRATEGY SHOULD BE TRAINED IN

01:38:10.084 --> 01:38:11.252
SHOULD BE INTRODUCED TO STUDENTS

01:38:11.318 --> 01:38:12.853
BEFORE THEY GET HERE. SO IN OUR

01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:14.321
PRESENTATION TO THE CALIFORNIA

01:38:14.388 --> 01:38:15.889
STUDENT AID COMMISSION WE ALSO

01:38:15.956 --> 01:38:17.057
BROUGHT THAT THERE BECAUSE THE

01:38:17.124 --> 01:38:18.192
STATE IS FINDING SEVERAL PRE

01:38:18.259 --> 01:38:19.860
COLLEGE.

01:38:19.927 --> 01:38:22.096
I HAVE PRE COLLEGE PROGRAMS BUT

01:38:22.162 --> 01:38:23.130
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PRE COLLEGE

01:38:23.197 --> 01:38:24.898
PROGRAMS THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:38:24.965 --> 01:38:26.367
WHAT IS SEE SEE SEE WHAT IS THE

01:38:26.433 --> 01:38:27.935
ISSUE WHAT IS YOU SEE WHAT ARE

01:38:28.002 --> 01:38:29.803
THEIR REQUIREMENTS. AND THEN HOW

01:38:29.870 --> 01:38:31.305
DO YOU MAKE HOW DO YOU SUBMIT A

01:38:31.372 --> 01:38:32.373
COMPETITOR APPLICATION.

01:38:32.439 --> 01:38:34.308
AND THAT'S FAR AS WE GOT.

01:38:34.375 --> 01:38:35.976
BUT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT WHAT ITS

01:38:36.043 --> 01:38:37.678
FINANCIAL AID WATER COLLEGE

01:38:37.745 --> 01:38:39.380
FINANCES HOW RIGHT TAKE CARE OF

01:38:39.446 --> 01:38:40.614
MYSELF ONCE I GET TO COLLEGE

01:38:40.681 --> 01:38:42.916
CITING INSTITUTIONALIZING IS

01:38:42.983 --> 01:38:44.585
WHAT ARE THE DIRECT SERVICES

01:38:44.652 --> 01:38:46.186
THAT WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE

01:38:46.253 --> 01:38:47.788
WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY. AND

01:38:47.855 --> 01:38:49.390
ADVOCATING FOR BASIC NEEDS TO BE

01:38:49.456 --> 01:38:51.358
PRIORITIZED WITHIN THE

01:38:51.425 --> 01:38:52.393
UNIVERSITY WITHIN OUR STATE

01:38:52.459 --> 01:38:53.727
BUDGET BUT THEN ALSO

01:38:53.794 --> 01:38:55.029
UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE IS A

01:38:55.095 --> 01:38:57.131
PRE COLLEGE COMPONENT TO THAT

01:38:57.197 --> 01:38:58.832
THAT IS ESSENTIAL.

01:38:58.899 --> 01:38:59.433
BECAUSE WE SHOULDN'T BE HAVING

01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:00.601
TO.

01:39:00.668 --> 01:39:02.936
GOAL RECRUIT STUDENTS TO TRY TO

01:39:03.003 --> 01:39:04.638
COME TO BASIC NEEDS

01:39:04.705 --> 01:39:05.306
INTERVENTIONS THAT WE'RE

01:39:05.372 --> 01:39:07.107
DESIGNING DATIA COMING KNOWING

01:39:07.174 --> 01:39:08.475
THAT A SUCCESSFUL STUDENT.

01:39:08.542 --> 01:39:10.911
PRIORITIZE OF THEIR BASIC NEEDS

01:39:10.978 --> 01:39:12.012
AND THAT AND THIS IS HOW YOU DO

01:39:12.079 --> 01:39:13.247
IT CITING THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:39:13.314 --> 01:39:14.381
WE'RE REALLY EXCITED FOR BECAUSE

01:39:14.448 --> 01:39:16.350
THAT PRE COLLEGE COMPONENT.

01:39:16.417 --> 01:39:17.718
SERVES ALL THREE OF OUR SYSTEMS

01:39:17.785 --> 01:39:19.219
A BETTER PREPARED STUDENT GOING

01:39:19.286 --> 01:39:22.222
INTO THE CCC CSU YOU SEE TAKES

01:39:22.289 --> 01:39:24.258
CARE OF THEIR BASIC NEEDS.

01:39:24.325 --> 01:39:25.859
AND I'LLJUST PIGGYBACK OPT OUT

01:39:25.926 --> 01:39:26.093
ANOTHER.

01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:28.329
.

01:39:28.395 --> 01:39:29.563
PEACE THAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING

01:39:29.630 --> 01:39:30.931
TO STRESS ARE AROUND

01:39:30.998 --> 01:39:32.433
INSTITUTIONALIZING EFFORT THAT

01:39:32.499 --> 01:39:34.935
INFRASTRUCTURE CAN SO YOU CAN

01:39:35.002 --> 01:39:37.104
HAVE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES BUT

01:39:37.171 --> 01:39:37.905
YOU HAVE TO HAVE PEOPLE ON

01:39:37.971 --> 01:39:39.840
CAMPUS WHO CAN RUN THOSE

01:39:39.907 --> 01:39:41.308
SERVICES AND PROGRAMS AND. MANY

01:39:41.375 --> 01:39:42.943
TIMES THE FOLKS ON OUR CAMPUSES

01:39:43.010 --> 01:39:44.345
ARE WEARING MANY HATS

01:39:44.411 --> 01:39:45.979
AND THIS IS THAT ADDITIONAL HAT

01:39:46.046 --> 01:39:47.948
SO HOW DO WE START TO THINK

01:39:48.015 --> 01:39:50.017
ABOUT WAYS THAT WE CAN HAVE

01:39:50.084 --> 01:39:52.052
FOLKS IN. THOSE PROGRAMS AND

01:39:52.119 --> 01:39:53.821
SERVICES THAT ARE FOCUSED ON

01:39:53.887 --> 01:39:55.122
BASIC NEEDS.

01:39:55.189 --> 01:39:57.057
AND YOU KNOW WHEN YOU THINK

01:39:57.124 --> 01:39:59.893
ABOUT STUDENT SUCCESS YOU KNOW

01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:01.462
YOU MAY HEAR THE TERM ALL WILL

01:40:01.528 --> 01:40:02.996
YOU KNOW EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS

01:40:03.063 --> 01:40:05.065
ARE NOT SOCIAL SERVICE. AGENCIES

01:40:05.132 --> 01:40:06.834
BUT WE ARE STUDENT SUCCESS

01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:08.936
AGENCIES WE ARE PROMOTING

01:40:09.002 --> 01:40:10.337
STUDENT SUCCESS WERE TRYING TO

01:40:10.404 --> 01:40:11.839
GET STUDENTS TO STAY IN SCHOOL

01:40:11.905 --> 01:40:13.640
TO GRADUATE AND THEN GOING TO

01:40:13.707 --> 01:40:15.676
THE WORKFORCE AND BE PRODUCTIVE.

01:40:15.743 --> 01:40:17.411
SO I THINK AS WE START TO THINK

01:40:17.478 --> 01:40:18.879
ABOUT THIS WHOLE LISTA COOLEY

01:40:18.946 --> 01:40:19.847
AND THINKING ABOUT ALL THE

01:40:19.913 --> 01:40:21.315
DIFFERENT VARIABLES THAT PLAY

01:40:21.382 --> 01:40:23.417
INTO A STUDENT SUCCESS WE HAVE

01:40:23.484 --> 01:40:24.618
TO THINK ABOUT WHILE THAT'S WE

01:40:24.685 --> 01:40:26.286
HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HEALTH AND

01:40:26.353 --> 01:40:27.054
WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT BASIC

01:40:27.121 --> 01:40:29.223
NEEDS. AT FOUNDATIONS FOR

01:40:29.289 --> 01:40:30.991
LEARNING AND FOUNDATIONS FOR

01:40:31.058 --> 01:40:32.393
STUDENT SUCCESS.

01:40:32.459 --> 01:40:33.861
IN JUST ONE BRIEF COMMENT TO

01:40:33.927 --> 01:40:34.828
BUILDING ON OUR.

01:40:34.895 --> 01:40:36.897
INVERTED PYRAMID MODEL AND WILL

01:40:36.964 --> 01:40:38.198
SEND THAT THE DIAGRAM OF

01:40:38.265 --> 01:40:40.100
INTEGRITY WE WORK WITH ON THIS.

01:40:40.167 --> 01:40:41.301
THE THE OUT REACH THAT'S PRE

01:40:41.368 --> 01:40:42.636
CALL IS IMPORTANT BUT ALSO THE

01:40:42.703 --> 01:40:44.371
TRANSFER THE ADMISSIONS IN THE

01:40:44.438 --> 01:40:45.439
MESSAGING AT STUDENTS COME AND

01:40:45.506 --> 01:40:46.306
AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE

01:40:46.373 --> 01:40:47.741
WORKING ON THE NEXT PHASE THAT

01:40:47.808 --> 01:40:49.576
ARE YOU SEE. INSTITUTIONALIZING

01:40:49.643 --> 01:40:51.245
EFFORTS IS ENSURING THAT OUR

01:40:51.311 --> 01:40:52.613
MISSIONS FOLKS ACTUALLY LOOK AT

01:40:52.679 --> 01:40:54.415
BASIC NEEDS PREPARATIONS AS A

01:40:54.481 --> 01:40:56.183
NET POSITIVE TO PROMOTE. THAT

01:40:56.250 --> 01:40:57.050
WE'RE HERE TO SUPPORT YOUR

01:40:57.117 --> 01:40:58.051

FOOD INSECURITY HOUSING

01:41:00.721 --> 01:41:02.122
INSECURITY. THAT WE'RE

01:41:02.189 --> 01:41:03.557
DEVELOPING THE SYSTEMS AND TOOLS

TO HELP THEM SUCCEED AND THAT

01:41:05.392 --> 01:41:06.460
WILL ONLY BE SUCCESSFUL IF WE

01:41:06.527 --> 01:41:08.395
TIED THE PRE COLLEGE WITH THE

01:41:08.462 --> 01:41:09.696
PREPARATORY IN THE TRANSITION

01:41:09.763 --> 01:41:10.998
SUPPORT THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:41:11.064 --> 01:41:12.332

VILLAGE EFFORT REALLY BILLS THE

01:41:37.524 --> 01:41:38.025

01:42:39.553 --> 01:42:40.721
RECEIVE ALL THOSE ARE HUNDRED

01:42:40.787 --> 01:42:43.223
EIGHTY FIVE APPLICATIONS. THEN

01:42:43.290 --> 01:42:44.558
THEY'RE ONLY GOING TO PROCESS AS

01:42:44.625 --> 01:42:46.460
MUCH AS THAT ONE FAX MACHINE IN

01:42:46.527 --> 01:42:48.662
THAT ONE COUNTY CAN DO SOMETHING

01:42:48.729 --> 01:42:49.296
SOMETHING THAT WERE ALSO BEING

01:42:49.363 --> 01:42:51.498
MINDFUL IS HOW DO WE TALK ABOUT

01:42:51.565 --> 01:42:53.500
THE INSTITUTIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE

01:42:53.567 --> 01:42:55.502
AND THE PRIORITY OF BASIC NEEDS.

01:42:55.569 --> 01:42:56.770
AND HOW DOES THAT IMPACT OUR

01:42:56.837 --> 01:42:57.838
PARTNERS

01:42:57.905 --> 01:42:59.106
BECAUSE EXCEPT FOR A PARTNERS

01:42:59.172 --> 01:43:00.541
HAVE TO BE ALSO ALIGNMENT WITH

01:43:00.607 --> 01:43:03.010
OURS WE CAN BE SENDING TWO

01:43:03.076 --> 01:43:04.511
THOUSAND APPLICATIONS AND ONLY

01:43:04.578 --> 01:43:05.045
ACTUALLY FIVE HUNDRED GET

01:43:05.112 --> 01:43:06.747
PRICES.

01:43:06.813 --> 01:43:08.248
BECAUSE THEY HAD ONE FAX MACHINE

01:43:08.315 --> 01:43:09.449
TO WORK OUT OF SO THE

01:43:09.516 --> 01:43:11.285
CONVERSATIONS ARE ALSO HAVING TO

01:43:11.351 --> 01:43:12.953
BUILD THE VILLAGE AND SAY HOW DO

01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:14.821
WE DO THIS TOGETHER. SO SOME OF

01:43:14.888 --> 01:43:16.356
OUR PARTNERS HAVE ASKED DON'T

01:43:16.423 --> 01:43:17.991
SEND ME A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY

01:43:18.058 --> 01:43:19.293
FIVE APPLICATIONS IN ONE DAY.

01:43:19.359 --> 01:43:20.994
SEND ME TWENTY APPLICATIONS PER

01:43:21.061 --> 01:43:22.996
DAY SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A BETTER

01:43:23.063 --> 01:43:24.765
PROCESSING SYSTEM AND APPROVAL

01:43:24.831 --> 01:43:26.633
RATING BUT HOW DO YOU TELL A

01:43:26.700 --> 01:43:28.135
STUDENT YOU CAN APPLY TODAY YOU

01:43:28.201 --> 01:43:29.603
COME TOMORROW WHEN ALL OF OUR

01:43:29.670 --> 01:43:30.704
STUDENTS ARE SUFFERING FROM FOOD

01:43:30.771 --> 01:43:32.539
INSECURITY AND SOME OF THEM

01:43:32.606 --> 01:43:33.006
HOMELESSNESS AND FOOD

01:43:33.073 --> 01:43:34.541
INSECURITY.

01:43:34.608 --> 01:43:36.310
I AM THINK YOU I THINK I THINK

01:43:36.376 --> 01:43:38.512
THAT THIS IS A VERY HELPFUL TO

01:43:38.579 --> 01:43:39.913
NOW AND I HAVE JUST A QUICK

01:43:39.980 --> 01:43:41.915
QUESTION FOR ALL THREE. AND I

01:43:41.982 --> 01:43:43.417
NAY IN A COULDN'T UNDERSTAND I

01:43:43.483 --> 01:43:44.651
THINK ALL OF YOU TALKED ABOUT

01:43:44.718 --> 01:43:47.688
HOW IMPORTANT. IT WAS TO.

01:43:47.754 --> 01:43:49.856
EDUCATE OUR STUDENTS MAKE SURE

01:43:49.923 --> 01:43:51.158
THEY'RE EQUIPPED WITH THIS

01:43:51.224 --> 01:43:53.126
INFORMATION BY IS THE SUGGESTION

01:43:53.193 --> 01:43:55.162
THAT THIS HAPPENING QUE TWELVE

01:43:55.228 --> 01:43:56.863
AT THE END OF THEIR EACH YEAR OR

01:43:56.930 --> 01:43:57.598
IS THIS SOMETHING THAT'S

01:43:57.664 --> 01:43:59.967
EMBEDDED IN ORIENTATION FOR YOUR

01:44:00.033 --> 01:44:02.469
PARTICULAR INSTITUTION AND I GET

01:44:02.536 --> 01:44:03.537
THAT ORIENTATION IS.

01:44:03.604 --> 01:44:04.371
OPTIONAL.

01:44:04.438 --> 01:44:06.707
FOR SOME OF THESE INSTITUTIONS.

01:44:06.773 --> 01:44:08.108
I WOULD SUGGEST THAT IT HAPPENED

01:44:08.175 --> 01:44:09.876
IN BOTH PLACES IT NEEDS TO BE

01:44:09.943 --> 01:44:11.812
STATED AGAIN AND AGAIN THIS IS

01:44:11.878 --> 01:44:12.412
NOT FOR A LOT OF THE STUDENTS

01:44:12.479 --> 01:44:15.082
IN.

01:44:15.148 --> 01:44:17.551
ALL OF OUR SYSTEMS THEY NEED TO

01:44:17.618 --> 01:44:18.919
HEAR THIS MANY ARE FIRST

01:44:18.986 --> 01:44:20.687
GENERATION STUDENTS MANY HAVE

01:44:20.754 --> 01:44:22.623
LANGUAGE BARRIERS. THEY NEED TO

01:44:22.689 --> 01:44:24.591
HEAR THIS INFORMATION AS OFTEN

01:44:24.658 --> 01:44:26.760
AS POSSIBLE TO MAKE IT STICK

01:44:26.827 --> 01:44:28.762
BECAUSE IT'S A BIG TRANSITION

01:44:28.829 --> 01:44:30.831
OUT OF K. TWELVE AND INTO.

01:44:30.897 --> 01:44:33.000
COLLEGE IT'S IN A CULTURE SHOCK

01:44:33.066 --> 01:44:34.434
FOR MANY OF THE STUDENTS JUST

01:44:34.501 --> 01:44:36.737
FINANCIALLY SO I THINK IT SHOULD

01:44:36.803 --> 01:44:38.639
HAPPEN AT THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM

01:44:38.705 --> 01:44:42.709
AND A. UPON ORIENTATION INTO IT

01:44:42.776 --> 01:44:44.444
ANY ONE OF THE THREE SEGMENTS.

01:44:44.511 --> 01:44:45.412
AND THE CONVERSATION THAT I

01:44:45.479 --> 01:44:46.380
THINK THAT HE'S WAS BRINGING UP

01:44:46.446 --> 01:44:48.348
IS THE FACT THAT WE NEED TO HAVE

01:44:48.415 --> 01:44:50.117
PEOPLE ON OUR CAMPUSES THAT CAN

01:44:50.183 --> 01:44:51.785
DO THIS WORK.

01:44:51.852 --> 01:44:53.620
BECAUSE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN THEN

01:44:53.687 --> 01:44:54.955
I'LL GIVE AN EXAMPLE AT AT OUR

01:44:55.022 --> 01:44:56.923
CAMPUS AT BERKELEY. IT WE SAY

01:44:56.990 --> 01:44:58.225
LET'S FULLY INTEGRATE BASIC

01:44:58.291 --> 01:44:59.593
NEEDS AND TO THE ORIENTATION

01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:01.361
MODEL NOW IT'S GONNA BE MY

01:45:01.428 --> 01:45:03.363
RESPONSIBILITY TO DO THAT ON TOP

01:45:03.430 --> 01:45:04.164
OF MY RESPONSIBILITY

01:45:04.231 --> 01:45:06.133
FACILITATING SYSTEM MIGHT

01:45:06.199 --> 01:45:06.700
CONVERSATIONS AND BEING HERE

01:45:06.767 --> 01:45:07.634
WITH YOU ALL.

01:45:07.701 --> 01:45:09.236
SO THEN WHEN THERE'S IN SOME

01:45:09.302 --> 01:45:10.804
WHEN THERE'S NO PEOPLE ON THE

01:45:10.871 --> 01:45:12.706
CAMPUSES IT'S HAVING TO FIGURE

01:45:12.773 --> 01:45:14.675
OUT HOW DO WE MAKE THINGS HAPPEN

01:45:14.741 --> 01:45:16.209
AND THAT'S WHEN YOU HAVE TO ADD

01:45:16.276 --> 01:45:17.377
ANOTHER HAT ON ANOTHER HAD

01:45:17.444 --> 01:45:18.712
ANOTHER HOW TO FOLKS. THAT'S

01:45:18.779 --> 01:45:20.280
RIGHT YOUR COMMITMENT THIS LAST

01:45:20.347 --> 01:45:21.815
YEAR WAS CRUCIAL THIS WAS THE

01:45:21.882 --> 01:45:23.316
FIRST TIME THAT WE ACTUALLY HAD

01:45:23.383 --> 01:45:25.552
FUNDING TO HAVE PEOPLE AND NOT

01:45:25.619 --> 01:45:27.754
JUST SERVICES. BECAUSE WHEN YOU

01:45:27.821 --> 01:45:28.855
JUST HAVE SERVICES THAT NO

01:45:28.922 --> 01:45:30.390
PEOPLE A YEAR PRIOR GONNA GOING

01:45:30.457 --> 01:45:32.092
TO VOLUNTEER MODEL. BE YOU'RE

01:45:32.159 --> 01:45:34.127
GOING TO ACTIVATE STUDENTS AND

01:45:34.194 --> 01:45:35.662
WHATEVER CAPACITIES THEY HAVE

01:45:35.729 --> 01:45:37.197
AND THEN SEE THE QUALITY IN THE

01:45:37.264 --> 01:45:38.498
CONSISTENCY OF QUALITY OF

01:45:38.565 --> 01:45:40.100
SERVICES AT ALL OF OUR COLLEGE

01:45:40.167 --> 01:45:41.668
CAMPUSES. ARE GONNA BE

01:45:41.735 --> 01:45:44.271
INCREDIBLY WIDE OF A SPECTRUM

01:45:44.337 --> 01:45:45.772
YES SOME CAMPUSES RIGHT NOW THAT

01:45:45.839 --> 01:45:47.140
ARE SERVING UPWARDS OF LIKE

01:45:47.207 --> 01:45:48.975
EIGHT THOUSAND UNIQUE STUDENTS

01:45:49.042 --> 01:45:51.344
YOU HAVE OTHER CAMPUSES WERE

01:45:51.411 --> 01:45:52.279
SERVING EIGHT STUDENTS.

01:45:52.345 --> 01:45:54.114
AND THE NEED ISN'T THAT

01:45:54.181 --> 01:45:55.949
DIFFERENT AND THOSE TWO CAMPUSES

01:45:56.016 --> 01:45:56.516
SOMETHING THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

01:45:56.583 --> 01:45:58.385
GOING INTO THE CONVERSATION IS

01:45:58.452 --> 01:45:59.686
HONORING THE FACT THAT IT HAS TO

01:45:59.753 --> 01:46:01.288
HAPPEN ON CAMPUS BUT THEY HAVE

01:46:01.354 --> 01:46:02.756
TO COME PREPARED. TO DO THAT

01:46:02.823 --> 01:46:05.092
ALREADY AND FOR THOSE OF YOU ALL

01:46:05.158 --> 01:46:06.560
THAT READ THE LA TIMES THERE WAS

01:46:06.626 --> 01:46:08.028
A REALLY HIGH PROFILE STUDENT

01:46:08.095 --> 01:46:08.562
CASE ON THE LA TIMES FRONT

01:46:08.628 --> 01:46:10.263
COVER.

01:46:10.330 --> 01:46:12.866
PHOTOS VIDEOS ALL OF THAT BEING

01:46:12.933 --> 01:46:14.067
THE REASON WHY NEEDS TO BE

01:46:14.134 --> 01:46:15.502
HAPPENING ON BOTH IS BECAUSE

01:46:15.569 --> 01:46:17.437
THAT STUDENT WAS TOLD MULTIPLE

01:46:17.504 --> 01:46:17.971
TIMES TO COME TO THE BASIC

01:46:18.038 --> 01:46:19.940
NEEDS.

01:46:20.006 --> 01:46:21.174
SPACE ON CAMPUS WAS TOLD

01:46:21.241 --> 01:46:22.743
MULTIPLE TIMES TO TALK TO THE

01:46:22.809 --> 01:46:24.111
RIGHT PEOPLE THEY JUST FELT

01:46:24.177 --> 01:46:25.846
REALLY EMBARRASSED AND THEY FELT

01:46:25.912 --> 01:46:26.413
LIKE THEY HAD NO TIME TO DO

01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:27.681
THAT.

01:46:27.748 --> 01:46:29.382
BECAUSE OUR FAMILY WAS HOMELESS

01:46:29.449 --> 01:46:30.484
THEIR TWO SISTERS WERE HOMELESS

01:46:30.550 --> 01:46:31.685
AND THEIR BROTHER COULD BARELY

01:46:31.752 --> 01:46:32.753
KEEP UP THEIR JOB AND THEY WERE

01:46:32.819 --> 01:46:33.987
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO

01:46:34.054 --> 01:46:35.822
THAT TOGETHER AS A FAMILY. SO

01:46:35.889 --> 01:46:37.858
FOR THEM TO LEAVE THAT DATED A

01:46:37.924 --> 01:46:39.993
RHYTHM OF THAT TAKING CARE OF

01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:41.661
THE FAMILY TO COME MEET WITH ME

01:46:41.728 --> 01:46:43.029
TO HELP THEM FIGURE THINGS OUT

01:46:43.096 --> 01:46:44.431
IT ALWAYS FELT LIKE THEY WERE

01:46:44.498 --> 01:46:45.766
BETRAYING THEIR FAMILY. BECAUSE

01:46:45.832 --> 01:46:47.300
ONE HOUR AWAY FROM THE FAMILY

01:46:47.367 --> 01:46:49.369
WASN'T TAKING CARE OF THEM SO I

01:46:49.436 --> 01:46:49.936
THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:46:50.003 --> 01:46:50.604
WE'RE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW. HOW

01:46:50.670 --> 01:46:52.005
DO WE BUILD A CULTURE WHERE WE

01:46:52.072 --> 01:46:53.240
CELEBRATE THE FACT THAT

01:46:53.306 --> 01:46:55.509
SUCCESSFUL STUDENTS PRIORITIZE

01:46:55.575 --> 01:46:56.543
THEIR BASIC NEEDS BECAUSE IN WE

01:46:56.610 --> 01:46:58.278
TOOK CARE OF THAT STUDENT WITHIN

01:46:58.345 --> 01:46:59.679
A FIFTEEN MINUTE MEETING?

01:46:59.746 --> 01:47:01.047
INDISCRIMINATE MEMBERS TO THAT

01:47:01.114 --> 01:47:01.748
YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING A

01:47:01.815 --> 01:47:03.683
POPULATION OF ALMOST A MILLION

01:47:03.750 --> 01:47:05.218
OF THE STUDENTS WE SERVE IN THE

01:47:05.285 --> 01:47:07.254
STATE. SO THE SEVEN HAVE MILLION

01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:09.222
DOLLARS ARE HAVE GONE TO THAT

01:47:09.289 --> 01:47:10.791
AMPLIFY WHAT WE'RE ALREADY DOING

01:47:10.857 --> 01:47:12.225
WE'RE TRYING TO BE AS PROACTIVE

01:47:12.292 --> 01:47:13.760
AND PREVENTIVE IN OUR LONG TERM

01:47:13.827 --> 01:47:15.562
THINKING AS POSSIBLE. BUT THE

01:47:15.629 --> 01:47:17.097
POPULATION SIZE WERE SERVING

01:47:17.164 --> 01:47:19.499
ISN'T SMALL IN ANY MATTER SO

01:47:19.566 --> 01:47:20.467
JUST WE REALLY WANT TO PRESS

01:47:20.534 --> 01:47:21.635
UPON YOU THE APPRECIATION OF THE

01:47:21.701 --> 01:47:23.470
SUPPORT THIS LAST YEAR. IN THE

01:47:23.537 --> 01:47:25.005
ENORMITY OF WHAT WORK FACING

01:47:25.071 --> 01:47:26.907
GOING FORWARD SO THANK YOU AGAIN

01:47:26.973 --> 01:47:28.775
FOR MAKING TIME FOR US TODAY AND

01:47:28.842 --> 01:47:30.010
I JUST WANNA MAKE ONE COMMENT TO

01:47:30.076 --> 01:47:31.945
TO PIGGYBACK OFF OF THEIR

01:47:32.012 --> 01:47:33.046
ORIENTATION.

01:47:33.113 --> 01:47:34.581
ANOTHER IDEA IS ESPECIALLY FOR

01:47:34.648 --> 01:47:36.283
FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS HAVING

01:47:36.349 --> 01:47:37.984
ORIENTATIONS FOR THE PARENTS

01:47:38.051 --> 01:47:38.919
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S REALLY

01:47:38.985 --> 01:47:40.220
IMPORTANT AS WE TALK ABOUT

01:47:40.287 --> 01:47:41.955
PREPARING STUDENTS THAT PARENTS

01:47:42.022 --> 01:47:43.590
ON BOARD AND THEY UNDERSTAND THE

01:47:43.657 --> 01:47:45.058
COMMITMENTS AND.

01:47:45.125 --> 01:47:46.860
THUMB THAT SERVICES IN RESOURCE

01:47:46.927 --> 01:47:49.062
THAT SOURCES ARE AVAILABLE AND

01:47:49.129 --> 01:47:49.629
THAT'S WERE TALKING ABOUT A

01:47:49.696 --> 01:47:51.865
HOLISTIC EXPERIENCE ALSO DOING

01:47:51.932 --> 01:47:53.633
TRAINING FOR FACULTY AND STAFF

01:47:53.700 --> 01:47:55.135
TO TO LET THEM KNOW ABOUT WHAT

01:47:55.202 --> 01:47:56.469
RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE BECAUSE

01:47:56.536 --> 01:47:58.939
MANY TIMES. FOR STUDENTS THEY

01:47:59.005 --> 01:48:00.006
MAY FEEL COMFORTABLE GOING TO A

01:48:00.073 --> 01:48:01.241
FACULTY OR ONE OF THEIR

01:48:01.308 --> 01:48:03.076
PROFESSORS AND THAT PERSON GIVE

01:48:03.143 --> 01:48:04.878
THEM THE WRONG. INFORMATION AND

01:48:04.945 --> 01:48:06.313
OR TELL THEM TO GO TO THE WRONG

01:48:06.379 --> 01:48:07.881
OFF THAT THEY MAY NOT OPEN UP

01:48:07.948 --> 01:48:09.449
AND SAY I NEED HELP AGAIN SO

01:48:09.516 --> 01:48:11.318
JUST MAKING SURE THAT EVEN ON

01:48:11.384 --> 01:48:12.586
CAMPUS OR DON'T WEAR NEST TO

01:48:12.652 --> 01:48:15.021
RESOURCES AND SERVICES AND

01:48:15.088 --> 01:48:16.790
PROGRAMS THAT ARE AVAILABLE.

01:48:16.857 --> 01:48:18.291
THINK IT WELL I APPRECIATE THE

01:48:18.358 --> 01:48:19.793
COMMENTS AND I THINK THEY THAT

01:48:19.860 --> 01:48:21.862
LEAST OF THIS YOU KNOW THIS

01:48:21.928 --> 01:48:23.463
HOUSE WAS REALLY INVESTED IN

01:48:23.530 --> 01:48:25.131
SEEN SOMETHING MOVE FORWARD. I

01:48:25.198 --> 01:48:25.532
THINK.

01:48:25.599 --> 01:48:27.701
WITH THE POPULATION OF OVER

01:49:55.989 --> 01:49:56.389
COMMITTEE IS TO REALLY

01:49:56.456 --> 01:49:58.591

EVALUATE AND.

01:50:22.949 --> 01:50:24.017
WE CAN SAY WELL WHY NOT ONE

01:50:24.084 --> 01:50:25.385
MILLION OR ONE NOT TEN MILLION

01:50:25.452 --> 01:50:26.119
RIGHT I MEAN IT'S IT'S VERY

01:50:26.186 --> 01:50:27.454

01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:08.655
OF SAYING WE KNOW THIS WE DON'T

01:52:08.721 --> 01:52:10.156

HAVEN'T TRIED THIS. FOR US TO

01:52:11.624 --> 01:52:12.826
STRATEGIZE HOW TO BEST MOVE

01:52:12.892 --> 01:52:14.394
FORWARD IN THIS CONVERSATION AND

01:52:14.461 --> 01:52:15.195
IN TERMS OF AUTOMATIC

01:52:15.261 --> 01:52:17.230
ELIGIBILITY IT COMES BACK TO THE

01:52:17.297 --> 01:52:19.165
INFRASTRUCTURE. SO WHEN YOU DO

01:52:19.232 --> 01:52:20.834
AUTOMATIC ENROLLMENT HOW DOES

01:52:20.900 --> 01:52:22.502
THAT LOOK LIKE WHEN SOME

01:52:22.569 --> 01:52:24.304
COUNTIES ARE OUR TECHNOLOGY

01:52:24.370 --> 01:52:27.140
INTEGRATED SOME CAMPUSES ARE

01:52:27.207 --> 01:52:28.541
STILL PAPER PAPER TRAIL. SO THEN

01:52:28.608 --> 01:52:29.542
DOES PROCESS THESE ARE GONNA BE

01:52:29.609 --> 01:52:30.610
DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU

01:52:30.677 --> 01:52:32.579

01:52:36.349 --> 01:52:37.484
COUNTY.

01:52:37.550 --> 01:52:39.018
SO I THINK WE CAN START MOVING

01:52:39.085 --> 01:52:40.286
IN THAT DIRECTION AND WE CAN

01:52:40.353 --> 01:52:41.321
CERTAINLY PILOT SOME COUNTIES

01:52:41.387 --> 01:52:44.124
LIKE SAN DIEGO ALAMEDA SO ON AND

01:52:44.190 --> 01:52:45.325
SO FOR THAT ALREADY HAVE HIGH

01:52:45.391 --> 01:52:47.026
NUMBERS THAT ARE ARE. ARE

01:52:47.093 --> 01:52:48.561
INTERESTED IN BEING INNOVATORS

01:52:48.628 --> 01:52:50.730
AND PUSHING THE ENVELOPE TO SEE

01:52:50.797 --> 01:52:52.532
HOW THAT SCALING WORKS BUT IT'S

01:52:52.599 --> 01:52:53.333
GONNA BE SOMETHING THAT'S GOING

01:52:53.399 --> 01:52:54.701

INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT'S NEEDED I

01:53:02.175 --> 01:53:03.676
THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN

COME BACK TO WITH OUR TEAMS

01:53:05.011 --> 01:53:06.479
BECAUSE NOW EVERYBODY HEARD IN

01:53:06.546 --> 01:53:07.113
THIS ROOM THAT THEY WERE BEING

01:53:07.180 --> 01:53:08.581
ASKED THAT. BECAUSE SOMETIMES

01:53:08.648 --> 01:53:09.782
WERE TOLD DON'T GIVE YOU

01:53:09.849 --> 01:53:11.284
ANYTHING THAT YOU DON'T ASK FOR

SO NOW YOU ASK THOSE GREAT

01:53:12.185 --> 01:53:13.820
QUESTIONS THAT WE CAN MOVE IN

01:53:13.887 --> 01:53:15.021
THAT DIRECTION. AND I SAY THAT

01:53:15.088 --> 01:53:16.356
WITH A LOT OF LOVE FOR THE

01:53:16.422 --> 01:53:18.124
PEOPLE IN THE ROOM THAT I

01:53:18.191 --> 01:53:27.367
TOTALLY LOST AND YOU'RE NOT EVEN

01:53:27.433 --> 01:53:28.001
GIVE ABOVE OR ASK FOR SO THAT'S

01:53:28.067 --> 01:53:29.469
NOT.

01:53:29.536 --> 01:53:31.304
EH BUT BUT BUT AGAIN I THINK

01:53:31.371 --> 01:53:33.606

THEY'RE HUNDREDS AKA WE TEND

01:53:41.481 --> 01:53:42.048
EXTRA YEAH RIGHT IN SO I THINK

01:53:42.115 --> 01:53:42.615
THAT WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND.

01:53:42.682 --> 01:53:43.816
WHY?

01:53:43.883 --> 01:53:44.450
WERE SOME OF THE PITFALLS ARE

01:53:44.517 --> 01:53:45.852
BECAUSE OTHERWISE.

01:53:45.919 --> 01:53:47.187
IF MORE SPENDING MONEY AND IT'S

01:53:47.253 --> 01:53:49.022
NOT BEING USED CORRECTLY THAT'S

01:53:49.088 --> 01:53:50.256
NOT A GOOD USE OUR RESOURCES

01:53:50.323 --> 01:53:52.325
RIGHT EITHER. SO WE WE NEED TO

REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW THAT'S

01:53:53.893 --> 01:53:55.128
WORKING FROM BEGINNING TO END.

REDUCE TO IT TO ADDRESS THIS

01:54:43.343 --> 01:54:45.044
ISSUE SELLING HIS ORCHESTRA

01:54:45.111 --> 01:54:46.012
MEDINA.

01:54:46.079 --> 01:54:46.813
I I THINK THE.

01:54:46.879 --> 01:54:48.748
WE ARE JUST BEGINNING TO SEE

01:54:48.815 --> 01:54:49.449
THE ENORMITY OF THE OF THE

01:54:49.515 --> 01:54:51.117
CHALLENGE

01:54:51.184 --> 01:54:52.752
AHEAD OF US AND I THINK TIM YOU

01:54:52.819 --> 01:54:54.654
WERE WITH US AT THE HEARING. AT

01:54:54.721 --> 01:54:56.222
FRESNO CITY COLLEGE

01:54:56.289 --> 01:54:57.123
WE'RE STUDENTS LINED UP FOR

01:54:57.190 --> 01:54:59.192
QUITE AWHILE.

01:54:59.259 --> 01:55:01.060
TWO OUT PRESENT THAT THE THE

01:55:01.127 --> 01:55:02.695
ISSUE AND.

01:55:02.762 --> 01:55:04.397
MOST RECENTLY FRIDAY I WAS AT

01:55:04.464 --> 01:55:06.966
UC RIVERSIDE AND AGAIN THE

01:55:07.033 --> 01:55:08.368
STUDENTS OF UC RIVERSIDE. I

01:55:08.434 --> 01:55:10.770
SHARED WITH ME THE SAME CONCERNS

01:55:10.837 --> 01:55:14.107
ATTA UC RIVERSIDE SO I I THINK

01:55:14.173 --> 01:55:16.209
IT'S STARTING TO SINK IN AND I

01:55:16.276 --> 01:55:17.977
PLAYED A PLOT OF THE DIFFERENT

01:55:18.044 --> 01:55:18.978
EFFORTS.

01:55:19.045 --> 01:55:20.713
BOTH BY THE STUDENTS AND AND

01:55:20.780 --> 01:55:22.849
THE LEGISLATURE IN ADDRESSING

01:55:22.915 --> 01:55:25.018
THE ISSUE BUT I A QUESTION THAT

01:55:25.084 --> 01:55:27.287
I WOULD POSE IS. DO WE HAVE ANY

01:55:27.353 --> 01:55:29.355
ANY INFORMATION ON THE

01:55:29.422 --> 01:55:31.491
CORRELATION BETWEEN FOOD AND

01:55:31.557 --> 01:55:33.960
SECURITY. OF STUDENTS AND THE

01:55:34.027 --> 01:55:37.864
RAISING OF TUITION.

01:55:37.930 --> 01:55:39.999
THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION WE DON'T

01:55:40.066 --> 01:55:41.567
HAVE ANY DATA AVAILABLE NOW ON

01:55:41.634 --> 01:55:43.770
THAT PER SE ONE OF THE MOST

01:55:43.836 --> 01:55:45.338
DIFFICULT ELEMENTS TO TEASE OUT

01:55:45.405 --> 01:55:47.573
IS THE LITERACY OF THE COSTS OF

01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:49.075
COLLEGE AND SO.

01:55:49.142 --> 01:55:51.444
FOCUSING ON THEM TUITION HAS

01:55:51.511 --> 01:55:52.145
OFTEN.

01:55:52.211 --> 01:55:53.713
KIND OF LEFT SOMETHING BEHIND

01:55:53.780 --> 01:55:55.014
THE CURTAIN KNOWN AS A COST OF

01:55:55.081 --> 01:55:55.581
ATTENDANCE THAT WERE REALLY

01:55:55.648 --> 01:55:57.950
FOCUSED ON. THE HOUSING THE FOOD

01:55:58.017 --> 01:55:59.185
THE SUPPLEMENTAL COSTS OF

01:55:59.252 --> 01:56:00.753
ACTUALLY SUCCEEDING IN BEING

01:56:00.820 --> 01:56:02.021
PRESENT IN COLLEGE.

01:56:02.088 --> 01:56:04.123
SO I'M EXPLORING THOSE TOGETHER

01:56:04.190 --> 01:56:05.591
I THINK COULD BE A MORE.

01:56:05.658 --> 01:56:07.627
BENEFICIAL FRUITFUL

01:56:07.694 --> 01:56:08.728
CONVERSATION.

01:56:08.795 --> 01:56:10.229
SO IT'S REALLY WELL NOTED TO

01:56:10.296 --> 01:56:12.031
KIND OF LOOK AT THAT IN IN

01:56:12.098 --> 01:56:12.765
CONJUNCTION WITH A LARGER

01:56:12.832 --> 01:56:14.400
ENVIRONMENT. I THINK ONE OF THE

01:56:14.467 --> 01:56:15.668
CHALLENGES WHEN YOU ASK THAT

01:56:15.735 --> 01:56:17.804
QUESTION I REALLY LIKE YOUR YOUR

01:56:17.870 --> 01:56:18.404
GRAY ASKING SOME REALLY GREAT

01:56:18.471 --> 01:56:19.539
QUESTIONS.

01:56:19.605 --> 01:56:21.140
THERE'S A LOT BEEN THE MAJORITY

01:56:21.207 --> 01:56:22.542
MEETINGS HAVE TO BE AND SO.

01:56:22.608 --> 01:56:24.477
ONE OF THE THINGS ONE OF THE

01:56:24.544 --> 01:56:25.778
THINGS THAT WE THAT WE DON'T

01:56:25.845 --> 01:56:26.879
TALK ABOUT ENOUGH IS THE FACT

01:56:26.946 --> 01:56:28.681
THAT WE UNDERSTAND COLLEGE

01:56:28.748 --> 01:56:30.583
AFFORDABILITY THROUGH THE LENS

01:56:30.650 --> 01:56:31.784
OF TUITION AND FEES.

01:56:31.851 --> 01:56:33.219
WHICH IS AN INCOMPLETE LANDS

01:56:33.286 --> 01:56:34.454
BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

01:56:34.520 --> 01:56:36.289
HISTORY OF THE TOTAL COST OF

01:56:36.356 --> 01:56:37.623
ATTENDING A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY

01:56:37.690 --> 01:56:38.725
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:56:38.791 --> 01:56:40.960
HISTORICALLY. COST OF LIVING HAS

01:56:41.027 --> 01:56:41.994
ALWAYS BEEN MORE EXPENSIVE THAN

01:56:42.061 --> 01:56:43.896
TUITION AND FEES.

01:56:43.963 --> 01:56:45.832
SO WHEN WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THE

01:56:45.898 --> 01:56:47.533
TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE THEN

01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:49.335
THAT'S WHY WE'VE HAD GENERATIONS

01:56:49.402 --> 01:56:50.269
OF STUDENTS WHO HAVE STRUGGLED

01:56:50.336 --> 01:56:51.337
AT DIFFERENT LEVELS AND

01:56:51.404 --> 01:56:52.605
OBVIOUSLY TODAY'S STUDENT

01:56:52.672 --> 01:56:54.173
STRUGGLING EVEN MORE. JUST

01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:54.841
BECAUSE THINGS ARE MORE

01:56:54.907 --> 01:56:56.642
EXPENSIVE IN THE COST OF LIVING

01:56:56.709 --> 01:56:58.611
IS MORE EXPENSIVE TODAY. THERE'S

01:56:58.678 --> 01:57:00.046
A THERE'S BEEN SO MANY FACULTY

01:57:00.113 --> 01:57:00.947
THAT I'VE MET WAY IT'S

01:57:01.013 --> 01:57:01.981
ADMINISTRATORS THAT I'VE MET

01:57:02.048 --> 01:57:04.117
WITH FOLKS IN THE NONPROFIT

01:57:04.183 --> 01:57:05.785
WORLD AND THIRD PARTY ENTITIES.

01:57:05.852 --> 01:57:07.620
THAT JUST CANDIDLY SHARE WITH ME

01:57:07.687 --> 01:57:08.554
YOU KNOW WHAT I DON'T KNOW WHY

01:57:08.621 --> 01:57:10.490
THIS GENERATION STRUGGLING SO

01:57:10.556 --> 01:57:11.057
MUCH I WORKED MY WAY THROUGH

01:57:11.124 --> 01:57:11.824
COLLEGE.

01:57:11.891 --> 01:57:13.960
SO WHEN WHEN I HEAR FOLKS SAY

01:57:14.026 --> 01:57:15.161
THAT I ASK THEM HOW MUCH DID YOU

01:57:15.228 --> 01:57:16.195
PAY FOR RENTS WHEN YOU WERE IN

01:57:16.262 --> 01:57:17.930
COLLEGE.

01:57:17.997 --> 01:57:19.365
HOW MUCH WHAT YOUR FOOD BUDGET

01:57:19.432 --> 01:57:21.000
WHEN YOU WERE IN COLLEGE?

01:57:21.067 --> 01:57:22.535
HOW MUCH WISE IN YOUR BANK

01:57:22.602 --> 01:57:23.903
ACCOUNT WHEN YOU ARE IN COLLEGE

01:57:23.970 --> 01:57:25.805
AND YOU FELT COMFORTABLE?

01:57:25.872 --> 01:57:26.939
BECAUSE OF WHAT WAS IN YOUR BANK

01:57:27.006 --> 01:57:28.274
ACCOUNT TODAY STUDENTS ARE

01:57:28.341 --> 01:57:29.842
PROBABLY PAYING ANYWHERE FROM

01:57:29.909 --> 01:57:31.043
THREE TO FIVE TIMES MORE THAN

01:57:31.110 --> 01:57:32.678
WHAT YOU PAID FOR RENT.

01:57:32.745 --> 01:57:33.813
I'D TODAY STUDENTS ARE PAYING

01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:35.615
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE FOR FOOD

01:57:35.681 --> 01:57:36.783
SIGNIFICANT MORE FOR BOOKS SO ON

01:57:36.849 --> 01:57:38.184
AND SO FORTH.

01:57:38.251 --> 01:57:39.652
SO I THINK THAT CONVERSATION TO

01:57:39.719 --> 01:57:40.987
SOMETHING THAT WERE VERY

01:57:41.053 --> 01:57:43.723
COMMITTED TO AMPLIFYING AND

01:57:43.790 --> 01:57:45.458
SAYING TUITION AND FEES IS ONE

01:57:45.525 --> 01:57:47.226
THING COST OF LIVING IS ANOTHER.

01:57:47.293 --> 01:57:48.928
AND IN THAT THE COST OF LIVING

01:57:48.995 --> 01:57:50.696
CONVERSATION DO WE HAVE SPECIFIC

01:57:50.763 --> 01:57:52.965
QUALITY OF DATA I DON'T BELIEVE

01:57:53.032 --> 01:57:55.501
WE DO OTHER THEN WE KNOW THAT

01:57:55.568 --> 01:57:57.103
STICKER SHOCK CONTINUES TO BE

01:57:57.170 --> 01:57:59.105
ONE OF THE LARGEST REASONS WHY

01:57:59.172 --> 01:57:59.572
WE HAVE UNDER MATCHING

01:57:59.639 --> 01:58:01.073
HAPPENING.

01:58:01.140 --> 01:58:02.341
BOMB STICKER SHOCK CONTINUES TO

01:58:02.408 --> 01:58:04.010
BE ONE OF THE REASONS WHY MANY

01:58:04.076 --> 01:58:04.777
FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE

01:58:04.844 --> 01:58:06.779
STUDENTS STUDENTS OF COLOR.

01:58:06.846 --> 01:58:09.615
WOMEN AND LGBT PLUS STUDENTS

01:58:09.682 --> 01:58:11.150
SEE THE COST OF THAT AND KNOW

01:58:11.217 --> 01:58:12.285
THAT THE LIKELIHOOD OF THEM

01:58:12.351 --> 01:58:14.120
BEING ABLE TO PAY THAT OFF IS

01:58:14.187 --> 01:58:15.354
VERY MINIMAL BECAUSE NOBODY

01:58:15.421 --> 01:58:16.522
TAUGHT THEM HOW FINANCIAL AID

01:58:16.589 --> 01:58:17.857
WORKS.

01:58:17.924 --> 01:58:19.358
NOBODY HAD A CONVERSATION WITH

01:58:19.425 --> 01:58:21.060
THEM TO SAY YOUR TUITION AND

01:58:21.127 --> 01:58:23.229
FEES BECAUSE YOU QUALIFY FOR THE

01:58:23.296 --> 01:58:24.831
PAL GRANT AND THE CAL GRANT ARE

01:58:24.897 --> 01:58:26.332
GOING TO BE TAKING CARE OF WHAT

01:58:26.399 --> 01:58:27.667
WE NEED TO FOCUS WITH THE U. S.

01:58:27.733 --> 01:58:29.402
TO SAY. HOW DOES A LOAN SYSTEM

01:58:29.469 --> 01:58:31.003
WORK WHAT ARE YOUR COST OF

01:58:31.070 --> 01:58:32.205
LIVING SO THAT YOU KNOW HOW

01:58:32.271 --> 01:58:33.406
YOU'RE GOING TO ADDRESS THE DATA

01:58:33.473 --> 01:58:34.974
DAY IN COLLEGE?

01:58:35.041 --> 01:58:35.575
BECAUSE WHEN YOU TALK TO A

01:58:35.641 --> 01:58:37.543
FAMILY I LOVE DENISE'S POINT

01:58:37.610 --> 01:58:39.145
ABOUT FAMILY PREPARATION BECAUSE

01:58:39.212 --> 01:58:41.180
A FAMILY WILL ASK WELL THAT'S

01:58:41.247 --> 01:58:42.248
GREAT BUT HOW YOU GONNA PAY FOR

01:58:42.315 --> 01:58:43.583
RENT. BECAUSE I CAN'T PAY FOR

01:58:43.649 --> 01:58:44.917
YOUR RIGHT HOW YOU GONNA PAY FOR

01:58:44.984 --> 01:58:46.252
FOOD BECAUSE I'M NOT GONNA FEE

01:58:46.319 --> 01:58:47.620
NOT NO I'M GONNA BREAK IN FOR

01:58:47.687 --> 01:58:48.788
SECOND YEAH GO AHEAD BECAUSE.

01:58:48.855 --> 01:58:50.990
AS CHAIR OF HIGHER EDUCATION I

01:58:51.057 --> 01:58:53.826
VERY WELL UNDERSTAND THAT THE

01:58:53.893 --> 01:58:54.961
COST OF ATTENDING COLLEGE.

01:58:55.027 --> 01:58:57.129
IS NOT JUST TUITION AND FEES

01:58:57.196 --> 01:58:58.831
YEAH ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS

01:58:58.898 --> 01:59:00.967
THAT YOU SAID HOUSING BOOKS

01:59:01.033 --> 01:59:02.869
TRANSPORTATION. AND AND WE HAVE

01:59:02.935 --> 01:59:04.871
ATTEMPTED TO TRY IN THE

01:59:04.937 --> 01:59:07.540
LEGISLATURE TO EXPAND. OF THE

01:59:07.607 --> 01:59:08.908
CAL GRANT SYSTEM TO ADDRESS SOME

01:59:08.975 --> 01:59:10.343
OF THOSE NEEDS.

01:59:10.409 --> 01:59:12.712
BUT WE IN THE LEGISLATURE DON'T

01:59:12.778 --> 01:59:15.815
CONTROL. A COST OF HOUSING COSTA

01:59:15.882 --> 01:59:18.584
BOOKS WHAT WE DO CONTROL. IS

01:59:18.651 --> 01:59:20.052
TUITION AND FEES.

01:59:20.119 --> 01:59:23.322
SO I I WOULD ALSO GIVE YOU A ASK

01:59:23.389 --> 01:59:25.291
YOU TO COME BACK.

01:59:25.358 --> 01:59:27.693
AND TRY TO FLESH THAT OUT OKAY

01:59:27.760 --> 01:59:29.595
OKAY BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE TO ME

01:59:29.662 --> 01:59:31.464
THAT THERE IS A CORRELATION.

01:59:31.531 --> 01:59:33.533
AS FEES OF INCREASED.

01:59:33.599 --> 01:59:35.401
AS TUITION AS INCREASE WE HAVE

01:59:35.468 --> 01:59:38.271
BEGUN TO HEAR MORE AND MORE.

01:59:38.337 --> 01:59:39.005
STUDENTS.

01:59:39.071 --> 01:59:41.774
ABOUT THE FOOD INSECURITY AND

01:59:41.841 --> 01:59:43.676
HOUSING IN SECURITY SO I WOULD

01:59:43.743 --> 01:59:45.144
LIKE TO SEE THAT YEAH AND IF WE

01:59:45.211 --> 01:59:46.812
COULD GO BACK YEAH AND EXAMINE

01:59:46.879 --> 01:59:48.915
THAT I I THINK THAT WOULD BE

01:59:48.981 --> 01:59:50.616
HELPFUL. AND AGAIN.

01:59:50.683 --> 01:59:52.351
AT SOME THINGS WE DON'T CONTROL

01:59:52.418 --> 01:59:54.987
BUT TUITION AND FEES WE DO YEAH

01:59:55.054 --> 01:59:55.187
AND.

01:59:55.254 --> 01:59:57.423
I I THINK WE NEED TO DO BETTER

01:59:57.490 --> 01:59:58.524
WOULD YOU LIKE US TO COME BACK

01:59:58.591 --> 01:59:59.892
WITH BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND

01:59:59.959 --> 02:00:01.994
QUALITATIVE ON THAT. YOU WANNA

02:00:02.061 --> 02:00:03.396
KNOW THE EXPONENTIAL DATA.

02:00:03.462 --> 02:00:04.497
EVERYTHING YOU CAN PRODUCE A

02:00:04.564 --> 02:00:05.865
WHOLE PREDOMINANT CULTURE

02:00:05.932 --> 02:00:06.766
BECAUSE WHEN I GO BACK TO OUR

02:00:06.832 --> 02:00:08.834
RESEARCH HE WAS GONNA COME FROM

02:00:08.901 --> 02:00:09.335
IS GONNA BE GREAT YEAH.

02:00:09.402 --> 02:00:13.573
QUESTION.

02:00:13.639 --> 02:00:16.909
YEAH YEAH MISTER MARTZ WHICH.

02:00:16.976 --> 02:00:19.679
YEAH. THAT'S A TRIP WITH.

02:00:19.745 --> 02:00:20.846
MAYBE IT JUST SEEMS LIKE A.

02:00:20.913 --> 02:00:22.582
RECURRING THEME IN AND BUDGET

02:00:22.648 --> 02:00:24.350
SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING SAID.

02:00:24.417 --> 02:00:26.519
MORE MORE WHERE WE'RE HEARING IT

02:00:26.586 --> 02:00:28.688
JUST LIKE THE REST OF THE STATE.

02:00:28.754 --> 02:00:30.156
YOU KNOW IT'S THE HOUSING CRISIS

02:00:30.222 --> 02:00:32.658
I MEAN THE IT.

02:00:32.725 --> 02:00:33.859
AND AND AND SO WHILE WE'RE

02:00:33.926 --> 02:00:35.895
HAVING DEBATES ABOUT LEGISLATION

02:00:35.962 --> 02:00:39.265
TO TO INCENTIVIZE TO. YOU KNOW

02:00:39.332 --> 02:00:41.634
OF MORE AND AND HIGHER DENSITY

02:00:41.701 --> 02:00:42.969
HOUSING.

02:00:43.035 --> 02:00:45.504
I I THINK WE NEED TO JUST NOT

02:00:45.571 --> 02:00:47.373
JUST FOCUS ON.

02:00:47.440 --> 02:00:49.108
FOOD AND SECURITY BUT I THINK

02:00:49.175 --> 02:00:51.110
THE BIGGER PICTURE IS THAT THEY

02:00:51.177 --> 02:00:54.714
DID THAT DRIVING COST OF HOUSING

02:00:54.780 --> 02:00:56.882
AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO.

02:00:56.949 --> 02:00:59.986
YOU NOW HAVE MORE FOCUS ON.

02:01:00.052 --> 02:01:01.253
HOW CAN WE YOU KNOW EITHER

02:01:01.320 --> 02:01:01.587
THROUGH?

02:01:01.654 --> 02:01:04.090
?

02:01:04.156 --> 02:01:06.292
A BOND OR OR OR OR MORE OF A

02:01:06.359 --> 02:01:08.327
FUNDING FOR OUR UNIVERSITIES TO

02:01:08.394 --> 02:01:10.196
BUILD MORE STUDENT HOUSING MORE

02:01:10.262 --> 02:01:12.431
HIGH DENSITY STUDENT HOUSING.

02:01:12.498 --> 02:01:13.799
IN ORDER MAKE HOUSING MORE

02:01:13.866 --> 02:01:15.968
AFFORDABLE I THINK THAT IS AN

02:01:16.035 --> 02:01:16.802
IMPORTANT PART OF A CONVERSATION

02:01:16.869 --> 02:01:17.370
THAT I. HAVEN'T BEEN HEARING

02:01:17.436 --> 02:01:20.039
WHO.

02:01:20.106 --> 02:01:21.540
COULD I JUST ADD ONE COMMENT ON

02:01:21.607 --> 02:01:22.875
YOUR NOTE YOU KNOW IN THE

02:01:22.942 --> 02:01:24.543
COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. WE

02:01:24.610 --> 02:01:26.178
DON'T HAVE HOUSING PER SE WE

02:01:26.245 --> 02:01:27.680
HAVE ELEVEN OF THE CAMPUSES THAT

02:01:27.747 --> 02:01:28.447
OFFER DORMITORIES.

02:01:28.514 --> 02:01:30.516
.

02:01:30.583 --> 02:01:32.685
BUT WE ARE LOOKING AT A PROGRAM

02:01:32.752 --> 02:01:33.719
MODEL THAT'S HAPPENING DOWN IN

02:01:33.786 --> 02:01:35.254
LOS ANGELES COUNTY WITH AN

02:01:35.321 --> 02:01:37.390
ORGANIZATION CALLED HOVHANESS.

02:01:37.456 --> 02:01:38.457
AND THEY HAVE SOMETHING CALLED

02:01:38.524 --> 02:01:40.626
THE COLLEGE SUCCESS INITIATIVE

02:01:40.693 --> 02:01:42.928
THEY'RE USING UP COUNTY HOUSING

02:01:42.995 --> 02:01:44.597
DOLLARS AND PHILANTHROPIC

02:01:44.664 --> 02:01:46.766
DOLLARS. TO SUPPORT COMMUNITY

02:01:46.832 --> 02:01:48.401
COLLEGE THEY'RE WORKING WITH FOR

02:01:48.467 --> 02:01:49.869
COMMUNITY COLLEGES RIGHT NOW.

02:01:49.935 --> 02:01:52.004
TO PROVIDE RAPID RE HOUSING

02:01:52.071 --> 02:01:53.739
SERVICES TO PROVIDE HOUSING

02:01:53.806 --> 02:01:55.675
NAVIGATION SERVICES AND TO

02:01:55.741 --> 02:01:57.343
PROVIDE SUBSIDIES RENTAL

02:01:57.410 --> 02:02:00.312
SUBSIDIES FOR STUDENTS AND SO I.

02:02:00.379 --> 02:02:01.981
I THINK IT'S WORTH LOOKING AT I

02:02:02.048 --> 02:02:03.916
THINK IT'S UP BECAUSE I DON'T

02:02:03.983 --> 02:02:04.784
THINK THAT THERE'S ENOUGH MONEY

02:02:04.850 --> 02:02:06.118
IN EDUCATION TO SOLVE THE

02:02:06.185 --> 02:02:07.787
HOUSING CRISIS MAYBE THERE IS I

02:02:07.853 --> 02:02:08.387
DON'T KNOW BUT.

02:02:08.454 --> 02:02:10.756
BUT THIS IS A MODEL WHERE

02:02:10.823 --> 02:02:12.525
THEY'RE ACTUALLY LEVERAGING

02:02:12.591 --> 02:02:14.126
DOLLARS THAT ARE DESIGNATED FOR

02:02:14.193 --> 02:02:15.928
HOUSING EACH CLOCK COUNTY HAS A

02:02:15.995 --> 02:02:18.464
COORDINATED ENTRY PROGRAM. THAT

02:02:18.531 --> 02:02:20.032
SERVES HOMELESS PEOPLE IN

02:02:20.099 --> 02:02:22.134
GENERAL NOT EXCLUSIVE TO COLLEGE

02:02:22.201 --> 02:02:22.835
STUDENTS.

02:02:22.902 --> 02:02:25.137
BUT HOW DO WE GET CONNECTED WITH

02:02:25.204 --> 02:02:27.773
THOSE COORDINATED ENTRY FOLKS

02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:30.643
LOCALLY TO TO EXPAND THE WORK TO

02:02:30.710 --> 02:02:32.278
SUPPORT HOMELESS PEOPLE TO

02:02:32.344 --> 02:02:33.612
INCLUDE HOMELESS COLLEGE

02:02:33.679 --> 02:02:34.980
STUDENTS. AND WE SEE IT

02:02:35.047 --> 02:02:36.949
HAPPENING CONTRA COSTA WE SEE IT

02:02:37.016 --> 02:02:38.918
HAPPENING IN LOS ANGELES I THINK

02:02:38.984 --> 02:02:40.686
IT'S WORTH LOOKING AT THAT

02:02:40.753 --> 02:02:43.756
PROGRAM MODEL. AND AND TRYING TO

02:02:43.823 --> 02:02:45.758
FURTHER THAT EXPAND THAT SCALE

02:02:45.825 --> 02:02:46.826
THAT BECAUSE THOSE ARE HOUSING

02:02:46.892 --> 02:02:48.527
DOLLARS DESIGNATED FOR HOUSING

02:02:48.594 --> 02:02:49.929
SERVICES.

02:02:49.995 --> 02:02:52.732
SO IT'S JUST SOMETHING FOR

02:02:52.798 --> 02:02:54.734
CONSIDERATION IS ALSO A BILL ON

02:02:54.800 --> 02:02:56.268
NINE EIGHTEEN THAT WOULD CREATE

02:02:56.335 --> 02:02:57.670
ALSO HOUSING BILL THAT WOULD

02:02:57.737 --> 02:02:59.238
CREATE A SIXTY MILLION DOLLAR

02:02:59.305 --> 02:03:01.407
PROGRAM FOR TRANSITION AGE YOUTH

02:03:01.474 --> 02:03:02.675
UNACCOMPANIED YOUTH IN

02:03:02.742 --> 02:03:03.776
CALIFORNIA.

02:03:03.843 --> 02:03:05.978
I I THINK THAT IS ALSO

02:03:06.045 --> 02:03:07.546
SOMETHING THAT AND THOSE WHO I

02:03:07.613 --> 02:03:09.014
THINK WOULD BE USING PROP SIXTY

02:03:09.081 --> 02:03:10.616
FOUR DOLLARS THOUGH PLEASE DON'T

02:03:10.683 --> 02:03:11.517
QUOTE ME ON THAT.

02:03:11.584 --> 02:03:13.853
BUT IT'S THOSE TYPES OF

02:03:13.919 --> 02:03:16.489
INITIATIVES THAT ARE GROUNDED IN

02:03:16.555 --> 02:03:19.125
THE HOUSING WORK SPACE

02:03:19.191 --> 02:03:21.160
THAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE.

02:03:21.227 --> 02:03:22.628
ESPECIALLY FOR A SYSTEM OF OUR

02:03:22.695 --> 02:03:24.930
SIZE AND WITH THE NUMBER OF

02:03:24.997 --> 02:03:26.599
STUDENTS THAT WE HAVE AND SO I

02:03:26.665 --> 02:03:27.800
THOSE ARE THINGS I THINK WE

02:03:27.867 --> 02:03:29.769
SHOULD LOOK AT. AND TRY TO

02:03:29.835 --> 02:03:32.805
EXPLORE AND TRY TO EXPAND UPON.

02:03:32.872 --> 02:03:34.540
OKAY FAIR ENOUGH I KNOW WE'RE

02:03:34.607 --> 02:03:35.674
TALKING ABOUT HUNGER HERE.

02:03:35.741 --> 02:03:38.010
TIMELY BUT IT'S IT'S A BIG ISSUE

02:03:38.077 --> 02:03:38.544
BUT I DO END UP JUST A FEW

02:03:38.611 --> 02:03:39.945
THINGS.

02:03:40.012 --> 02:03:41.213
AT FOR A PURPORTED MOVE ON ONE

02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:41.380
IS.

02:03:41.447 --> 02:03:42.715
.

02:03:42.782 --> 02:03:44.984
AS OUR OUR BUDGET SERIOUSLY TO

02:03:45.050 --> 02:03:47.219
WHO WE DON'T CONTROL FEES AGAIN

02:03:47.286 --> 02:03:48.654
IT'S UP TO THE SEGMENTS GRANTED.

02:03:48.721 --> 02:03:49.922
THEY SAY IF WE FIND THE

02:03:49.989 --> 02:03:51.490
SYSTEMATIC QUICKLY THERE'S NOT

02:03:51.557 --> 02:03:52.725
THE PRESSURE TO INCREASE SPEED

02:03:52.792 --> 02:03:53.993
THE FIRST PLACE SO SO I GET THAT

02:03:54.059 --> 02:03:55.060
BUT.

02:03:55.127 --> 02:03:57.429
YOU KNOW IN LARGE PART THAT THAT

02:03:57.496 --> 02:03:59.565
BUILT THE NEEDIEST STUDENTS

02:03:59.632 --> 02:04:01.333
EITHER TELL GRANT RECIPIENTS OR

02:04:01.400 --> 02:04:01.834
CAL GRANT SO THAT SO THE

02:04:01.901 --> 02:04:04.170
TUITION.

02:04:04.236 --> 02:04:06.005
IS SOMEWHAT OFF THE TABLES KEEP

02:04:06.071 --> 02:04:06.572
ON THE MIDDLE THEY GET THE

02:04:06.639 --> 02:04:08.507
SQUEEZE PEOPLE THEIR FIFTH YEAR

02:04:08.574 --> 02:04:09.008
THEY DON'T GET THE COVER

02:04:09.074 --> 02:04:10.209
ANYMORE.

02:04:10.276 --> 02:04:11.744
BUT IT REALLY ARE THE OTHER

02:04:11.811 --> 02:04:13.813
ISSUES THAT REALLY COMPOUND THIS

02:04:13.879 --> 02:04:15.047
AND SO ACOSTA LIVING WE TALKED

02:04:15.114 --> 02:04:15.948
ABOUT.

02:04:16.015 --> 02:04:17.917
LAST YEAR.

02:04:17.983 --> 02:04:20.219
INCREASING OUR OUR CAL GRANT

02:04:20.286 --> 02:04:21.854
UMBER RACE HE RESTRUCTURING THE

02:04:21.921 --> 02:04:24.056
CAL GRANT PROGRAM SO IT COVERS

02:04:24.123 --> 02:04:26.192
NOT JUST THAT THE TUITION COSTS

02:04:26.258 --> 02:04:27.326
BECAUSE REALLY IT'S THE COST OF

02:04:27.393 --> 02:04:27.927
INSTRUCTION AS WE AS WE NOTED

02:04:27.993 --> 02:04:29.461
SO.

02:04:29.528 --> 02:04:30.429
THAT'S YOU KNOW LARGER

02:04:30.496 --> 02:04:31.831
DISCUSSION THAT WE TALK ABOUT A

02:04:31.897 --> 02:04:32.731
FEW WEEKS AGO THAT WOULD THAT

02:04:32.798 --> 02:04:34.900
WOULD CONTINUE BUT. BUT ON THIS.

02:04:34.967 --> 02:04:36.168
WE KNOW THAT OUR WORK IS NOT

02:04:36.235 --> 02:04:37.837
DONE AND AND I THINK THERE'S

02:04:37.903 --> 02:04:39.104
SOME THINGS THAT WILL TAKE A

02:04:39.171 --> 02:04:40.773
LOOK AT WHERE THIS YEAR AND.

02:04:40.840 --> 02:04:42.441
IN THE FUTURE AS WELL SO.

02:04:42.508 --> 02:04:46.579
SING NO FURTHER QUESTIONS ON

02:04:46.645 --> 02:04:48.380
ISSUE NUMBER ONE ALSO A CROSS

02:04:48.447 --> 02:04:50.082
CUTTING ISSUE.

KNOW HOW ADDITIONAL EXPENDITURES

02:06:12.798 --> 02:06:14.600

THE WORK WOULD BE SUSTAINED LONG

02:16:56.107 --> 02:16:57.542
TERM AND HOW SUCCESSFUL

02:16:57.609 --> 02:16:59.244

02:17:06.351 --> 02:17:07.652
COMPLETE.

02:17:07.719 --> 02:17:09.020
SO MOST PROJECTS INCLUDE

02:17:09.087 --> 02:17:10.622
ACTIVITIES THAT WILL IMPACT NEXT

02:17:10.689 --> 02:17:11.690

FIRST NEW FACULTY HIRING IS

02:17:51.863 --> 02:17:52.797
CHANGING THE SHAPE OF THE

02:17:52.864 --> 02:17:54.165
FACULTY OVERALL.

SECOND CAMPUSES HAVE

02:18:23.194 --> 02:18:24.562
INCREASINGLY EMBRACE BEST

FACULTY IS CRUCIAL TO STUDENT

02:18:33.872 --> 02:18:35.240
SUCCESS AND THESE PRIORITIES ARE

02:18:35.306 --> 02:18:37.275
INCREASING INCREASINGLY EMBEDDED

02:18:37.342 --> 02:18:39.210
IN THEIR SEARCH PROCESSES.

02:18:39.277 --> 02:18:41.046
CAMPUSES ARE ALSO FOCUSING ON

02:18:41.112 --> 02:18:42.614
RETAINING FACULTY OF COLOR

02:18:42.681 --> 02:18:43.815
THROUGH SUPPORT ON THE PATH TO

02:18:43.882 --> 02:18:45.917
TENURE AND MAKING SURE NEW

02:18:46.951 --> 02:18:48.820
UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY.

02:18:48.887 --> 02:18:50.922
FINALLY THE FUNDING CREATES

02:18:50.989 --> 02:18:52.323
AWARENESS AND SENDS THE MESSAGE

02:18:52.390 --> 02:18:53.358
THAT THESE ACTIVITIES ARE

02:18:53.425 --> 02:18:55.060
IMPORTANT TO THE CSU AND TO THE

02:18:55.126 --> 02:18:56.995
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

02:18:57.062 --> 02:18:58.963
GIVEN CAMPUSES LIMITED BUDGET

02:18:59.030 --> 02:18:59.964
FOR RECRUITING A PROFESSIONAL

02:19:00.031 --> 02:19:02.200
DEVELOPMENT. EVEN MODEST

02:19:02.267 --> 02:19:03.234
ADDITIONAL SUPPORT CAN HAVE A

02:19:03.301 --> 02:19:05.837
DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT.

02:19:05.904 --> 02:19:06.671
WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE

02:19:06.738 --> 02:19:08.306
INNOVATIONS FUNDED THIS YEAR

02:19:08.373 --> 02:19:10.208
CONTINUED AND EXPANDED.

02:19:10.275 --> 02:19:11.843
OUR BEST EFFORTS TO BRING IN NEW

02:19:11.910 --> 02:19:13.044
TENURE LINE FACULTY WILL BE

02:19:13.111 --> 02:19:15.180
POSSIBLE WHEN THE CSU BUDGET

02:19:15.246 --> 02:19:16.715
REQUEST IS FULLY FUNDED.

02:19:16.781 --> 02:19:18.717
IF THE CSU BUDGET REQUEST IS NOT

02:19:18.783 --> 02:19:20.385
FULLY FUNDED NOT ONLY IS IT

02:19:20.452 --> 02:19:21.953
LIKELY THAT BUDGETS THAT SUPPORT

02:19:22.020 --> 02:19:23.488
RECRUITING WILL BE STRAINED BUT

02:19:23.555 --> 02:19:24.889
IT'S VERY LIKELY THE NUMBER OF

02:19:24.956 --> 02:19:26.357
CAMPUSES WILL SIGNIFICANTLY

02:19:26.424 --> 02:19:27.792
SCALE BACK TENURE TRACK

02:19:27.859 --> 02:19:29.728
RECRUITING IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN.

02:19:29.794 --> 02:19:31.696
THAT COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR

02:19:31.763 --> 02:19:33.231
GOAL FOR A MORE DIVERSE FACULTY

02:19:33.298 --> 02:19:35.200
AND THAT'S WHY OUR TOP PRIORITY

02:19:35.266 --> 02:19:36.134
IS FOR FUNDING FOR THE CSU.

02:28:08.913 --> 02:28:09.647
TO.

02:28:09.714 --> 02:28:11.349
AND I'M SURE IT'S DIFFERENT FOR

02:28:11.415 --> 02:28:12.450
DIFFERENT AREAS BUT IN. MAYBE

02:28:12.516 --> 02:28:14.619
YOU CAN GIVE ME SOME EXAMPLES

DISTRICTS AND YOU KNOW WE WE

02:28:18.055 --> 02:28:19.724
RECEIVE MORE INFORMATIONS FROM

02:28:19.790 --> 02:28:21.192
SOME DISTRICTS THAN OTHERS. BUT

02:28:21.259 --> 02:28:22.393
I I I DO KNOW THAT.

02:28:22.460 --> 02:28:24.095
MANY DISTRICTS HAVE REPORTED

02:28:24.161 --> 02:28:24.528
THAT THE.

02:28:24.595 --> 02:28:26.497
THE INFLUX IN FULL TIME HIRING

02:28:26.564 --> 02:28:29.133
DOLLARS ONE TIME TWO YEARS AGO.

02:28:29.200 --> 02:28:30.668
IT ENABLED.

02:28:30.735 --> 02:28:32.403
MORE HIRING TO TAKE PLACE THAT

02:28:32.470 --> 02:28:33.504
PARTICULAR YEAR WHICH REMEMBER

02:28:41.512 --> 02:28:42.246
COUPLES.

02:28:42.313 --> 02:28:44.282
BUT DOWN I KNOW WAS REPORTED IS

02:28:44.348 --> 02:28:45.316
VERY IMPORTANT.

02:28:45.383 --> 02:28:48.219
THESE EEO DOLLARS AND NOT ONLY

02:28:48.286 --> 02:28:49.754
SOME OF THE PROGRAM'S LOCALLY

02:28:49.820 --> 02:28:51.255
THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED BUT.

02:28:51.322 --> 02:28:51.455
THE.

02:28:51.522 --> 02:28:52.990
.

02:28:53.057 --> 02:28:54.692
EMPHASIS THAT'S BEEN PLACED ON.

02:28:54.759 --> 02:28:56.527
BEST PRACTICES THROUGHOUT THE

02:28:56.594 --> 02:28:58.229
SYSTEM WE'VE HAD MANY DISTRICTS

02:28:58.296 --> 02:28:59.063
THAT HAVE SO THAT THAT'S BEEN

02:28:59.130 --> 02:29:00.865
INCREDIBLY HELPFUL AND.

02:29:00.931 --> 02:29:02.700
HAS ALLOWED THEM TO ADOPT

02:29:02.767 --> 02:29:04.335
PROGRAMS THAT BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN

02:29:04.402 --> 02:29:06.037
OTHER PLACES WHAT IT WILL BE

02:29:06.103 --> 02:29:07.972
HELPFUL WAS P. JUST TO GET A.

02:29:08.039 --> 02:29:08.506
GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF

SPECIFICALLY WHAT PROGRAMS AND

02:29:11.275 --> 02:29:14.178
WHAT COLLEGES ARE DISTRICTS ARE.

02:29:14.245 --> 02:29:16.047
BEING SUCCESSFUL FOR OUR AND

02:29:16.113 --> 02:29:17.481
WHAT'S WORKING OBVIOUSLY

02:29:17.548 --> 02:29:18.015
UNDERSTAND THAT DIFFERENT.

02:29:18.082 --> 02:29:19.350
.

02:29:19.417 --> 02:29:21.385
COLLEGES MAY DO DIFFERENT THINGS

02:29:21.452 --> 02:29:21.986
AND THAT'S TOTALLY

02:29:22.053 --> 02:29:23.754
UNDERSTANDABLE. BUT IT'S UNDER

02:29:23.821 --> 02:29:25.356
IT WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT

02:29:25.423 --> 02:29:27.291
WHAT'S WORKING ABSOLUTELY I.

02:29:27.358 --> 02:29:28.893
I CAN PULL TOGETHER MORE

02:29:28.959 --> 02:29:30.261

KICKING YOU WALK US THROUGH A

02:30:10.201 --> 02:30:11.569
LITTLE BIT HOW THE LOW POINT

02:30:11.635 --> 02:30:13.070
NINE MILLION WAS SPENT.

02:30:13.137 --> 02:30:14.772
ARE.

02:30:14.839 --> 02:30:15.706

02:30:18.476 --> 02:30:20.277
DIFFERENT WAYS.

02:30:20.344 --> 02:30:21.112
SURE WE HAVE.

02:30:21.178 --> 02:30:23.347
OBVIOUSLY TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES

02:30:23.414 --> 02:30:25.216

02:30:35.459 --> 02:30:37.461
LOT OF DIFFERENT IDEAS.

02:30:37.528 --> 02:30:39.497
ONE OF THE COMMON THREADS THAT

02:30:39.563 --> 02:30:41.999
WE SAW IN ALMOST EVERY PROPOSAL

02:30:42.066 --> 02:30:43.467
WAS A NEED FOR MORE.

02:30:43.534 --> 02:30:44.935
SEARCH COMMITTEE TRAININGS

02:30:45.002 --> 02:30:46.437
PARTICULARLY AROUND UNCONSCIOUS

BIAS AND SIMILAR THINGS AND SO

02:30:49.306 --> 02:30:50.641

ARE THINGS THAT WE PUT WE NEEDED

02:30:53.477 --> 02:30:54.712
TO WORK ONE ABOVE AND BEYOND

02:30:54.779 --> 02:30:55.813
THIS.

02:30:55.880 --> 02:30:57.648
PARTICULAR PROPOSAL BUT

02:30:59.483 --> 02:31:00.684
SYSTEMICALLY SO THAT'S SOMETHING

02:31:00.751 --> 02:31:02.653
WE'RE WORKING ON AND THEN THE

02:31:12.496 --> 02:31:14.365
SOME OF THEM ON ASKS FOR FUNDING

02:31:14.432 --> 02:31:16.801
TO HELP US START UP COSTS.

02:31:16.867 --> 02:31:18.869
I'M AND HELP SOME OTHER ADJUNCT

02:31:18.936 --> 02:31:20.704

OPPORTUNITIES ON BECAUSE.

02:31:24.341 --> 02:31:25.476
THERE'S A CERTAINLY AGREE A

02:31:25.543 --> 02:31:26.977
LARGE POOL WITH OF TEMPORARY

02:31:27.044 --> 02:31:28.245
FACULTY THAT COULD.

BECOME TENURE TRACK IN THE

02:31:29.580 --> 02:31:31.382
SEARCH PROCESS AND SOME OF THAT

02:31:31.449 --> 02:31:32.616
SUPPORT THAT THEY DON'T HAVE.

02:31:32.683 --> 02:31:35.386
FACULTY WERE INTERESTED IN MORE

02:31:35.453 --> 02:31:37.221

CONFERENCES OR NETWORKS THERE

02:31:40.958 --> 02:31:42.426
WERE ALSO A LOT OF PROPOSALS

02:31:42.493 --> 02:31:43.828
AROUND INCLUSION.

02:31:43.894 --> 02:31:45.162
BECAUSE I THINK ALL OF US

DEPARTMENTS THEY GAVE EACH A

02:33:05.175 --> 02:33:05.776
DECENT.

SHORT NOT CERTAINLY AND A COUPLE

02:33:11.248 --> 02:33:12.483
OF THE CAMPUS IS REALLY FOCUSED

02:33:12.550 --> 02:33:14.718
ON STEM DISCIPLINES AND.

SAID THERE WERE CERTAINLY SOME

02:33:16.754 --> 02:33:18.355
FOCUS CAMPUS SPECIFIC BUT THERE

02:33:18.422 --> 02:33:20.491

ONLY MENTIONED A FEW OF THE

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:31.435
CONFERENCES FOR EXAMPLE OF A

02:33:31.502 --> 02:33:32.903
DIVERSITY COMMENTS IS THAT WE'VE

02:33:32.970 --> 02:33:34.705
ATTENDED. BUT THERE WAS.

02:33:34.772 --> 02:33:36.440
A LOT OF EFFORT AROUND HELP WE

CAN WE REACH AND CREATE MORE

02:33:38.342 --> 02:33:41.111
DIVERSE POOLS AND. CERTAINLY AND

02:33:41.178 --> 02:33:41.946

INFORMATION FOR YOU ARE NOT

02:33:43.314 --> 02:33:45.816
SPECIFICALLY DEFINED A HELPFUL

02:33:45.883 --> 02:33:48.419
THAT THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL.

02:33:48.485 --> 02:33:49.787

02:33:49.853 --> 02:33:51.655
FAKE COME.

HISPIDUS CARLSON.

02:33:53.557 --> 02:33:53.924
FOR THE.

02:33:53.991 --> 02:33:56.193
I THINK FOR THE PRESENTATION WE

02:33:56.260 --> 02:33:57.061
REALLY APPRECIATE THE.

02:33:57.127 --> 02:33:59.463
SPECIFICITY IT REGARDING THE

02:33:59.530 --> 02:34:00.464
DEPARTMENTS AND.

02:34:00.531 --> 02:34:02.466
I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO

02:34:02.533 --> 02:34:04.101
HAVE A LITTLE MORE.

02:34:04.168 --> 02:34:06.136
UNDERSTANDING AT THE DEPARTMENT

02:34:06.203 --> 02:34:07.705
LEVEL WHAT SOME OF THE FUNDS

02:34:07.771 --> 02:34:09.173
WERE SPENT FOR I MEAN WE BECAME

02:34:09.239 --> 02:34:10.874
A LOT OF DISCRETION. AND.

02:34:10.941 --> 02:34:13.277
I DON'T I THINK WHAT WE'RE JUST

02:34:13.344 --> 02:34:15.346
LOOK REFORMERS FEEDBACK AS TO

02:34:15.412 --> 02:34:15.913
WHAT WAS EFFECTIVE IN THEIR

02:34:15.980 --> 02:34:18.115
MIND.

02:34:18.182 --> 02:34:19.483
THAT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT WE HAVE

02:34:19.550 --> 02:34:21.285
OUR OWN PART I HAVE MY OWN

02:34:21.352 --> 02:34:22.119
BELIEFS OF WHAT MIGHT BE

02:34:22.186 --> 02:34:23.420
EFFECTIVE BUT I THINK THIS IS AN

02:34:23.487 --> 02:34:24.688
OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY GET.

02:34:24.755 --> 02:34:26.190
SPECIFIC FEEDBACK FROM THE

02:34:26.256 --> 02:34:27.558
FACULTY MEMBERS WHO WERE IN

02:34:27.625 --> 02:34:29.793
CHARGE OF. THOSE AYE RECRUITMENT

02:34:29.860 --> 02:34:31.528

02:34:39.303 --> 02:34:42.673
ACT. ON COMMUNICORP IS OBVIOUSLY

02:34:42.740 --> 02:34:43.474
KNOWING THAT EACH OF THE.

02:34:43.540 --> 02:34:45.743
SEGMENT IS DIFFERENT BUT YET.

02:34:45.809 --> 02:34:47.711
THAT YOU'RE THERE PROBABLY THAT

02:34:47.778 --> 02:34:48.746
THE THE PLACES WHERE YOU'RE

CURRENT YEAR.

02:35:10.467 --> 02:35:11.669
I THINK BOTH BOTH FIGHTERS WOULD

02:35:11.735 --> 02:35:13.337
BE AND WOULD BE HELPFUL I I

02:35:13.404 --> 02:35:14.872

WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SOMETHING

02:35:34.224 --> 02:35:35.292
THAT WOULD HAVE NECESSARILY OUR

02:35:35.359 --> 02:35:38.095
CURRENT ME BAD. OBVIOUSLY SEEMS

02:35:38.162 --> 02:35:39.296
LIKE A MIX LAW SENSE BECAUSE WHY

02:35:39.363 --> 02:35:40.698

02:36:21.839 --> 02:36:24.308
TO JOIN THEM SO THAT IN ITSELF

02:36:24.374 --> 02:36:26.310
MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE AND AS A

02:36:26.376 --> 02:36:27.244
MOTIVATOR.

PLACE FOR THEM.

02:38:01.071 --> 02:38:03.140
THERE'S THERE'S NO MONEY IN THIS

02:38:03.207 --> 02:38:04.508
YEAR'S GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED

02:38:04.575 --> 02:38:06.710
BUDGET WE COULD CONSIDER AGAIN

02:38:06.777 --> 02:38:08.212
WHEN WE CLOSE OUT OUR BUDGET. OF

02:38:08.278 --> 02:38:09.746
ANY EIGHTEEN BUT I JUST HEARD

02:38:09.813 --> 02:38:12.449
THE IMPORTANCE OF OF FUNDING AND

02:38:12.516 --> 02:38:14.184
HOW EXPENSIVE THIS IS.

02:38:14.251 --> 02:38:16.153
AND IT'S CERTAINLY IMPORTANT.

02:38:16.220 --> 02:38:18.355
.

02:38:18.422 --> 02:38:19.289
ONE THING THAT I THINK IS

02:38:19.356 --> 02:38:21.625
MISSING IN THE DATA HERE IN

02:38:21.692 --> 02:38:23.560
FRONT OF US. IS THE COMPARISON

02:38:23.627 --> 02:38:25.162
BETWEEN FACULTY AND THE STUDENT

02:38:25.229 --> 02:38:26.830
BODY A WE HEARD FROM THE

02:38:26.897 --> 02:38:28.265
COMMUNITY COLLEGE THAT THE

02:38:28.332 --> 02:38:30.634
STUDENT BODY IS. FIFTY PERCENT.

02:38:30.701 --> 02:38:33.170
MINORITY FIFTY PERCENT. OF

A SIX PERCENT UNDER REPRESENTED

02:38:36.773 --> 02:38:38.242

THINK ACROSS DISCIPLINES WHICH

02:44:54.651 --> 02:44:55.819
IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY COSTS

02:44:55.885 --> 02:44:57.254
ARE HIGHER IS OFTEN DO SUCCEED.

02:44:57.320 --> 02:45:00.023
IS GOOD IS CLUSTER HIRING OF.

02:45:00.090 --> 02:45:01.625
LIMITED TO DEPARTMENT OR WOULD

02:45:01.691 --> 02:45:03.693
IT BE IT WOULD USUALLY BE A

02:45:03.760 --> 02:45:05.328
COULD BE IN A DEPARTMENT.

02:45:05.395 --> 02:45:08.732
WAR OF THE SANTA BARBARA PAT.

02:45:08.798 --> 02:45:11.301
PILOT THIS YEAR IN ECONOMICS

02:45:11.368 --> 02:45:12.769
HAD THEIR THINKING OF IT AS A

02:45:12.836 --> 02:45:14.237
CLUSTER HIGHER TO BRING IN

02:45:14.304 --> 02:45:16.006
PEOPLE WITH CERTAIN KINDS OF.

02:45:16.072 --> 02:45:18.642
EXPERTISE AND ECONOMICS BUT IT

02:45:18.708 --> 02:45:19.476
USUALLY.

02:45:19.542 --> 02:45:22.979
AMONG DEPARTMENTS AND ACROSS

02:45:23.046 --> 02:45:25.315
DEPARTMENTS AND AGAIN BECAUSE SO

02:45:25.382 --> 02:45:26.349
MANY OF THAT THE ISSUES.

02:45:26.416 --> 02:45:28.184
.

02:45:28.251 --> 02:45:28.818
FACULTY.

02:45:28.885 --> 02:45:31.154
ARE RESEARCHING GO BEYOND A

02:45:31.221 --> 02:45:32.322
SINGLE DISCIPLINE WHEN WE'RE

02:45:32.389 --> 02:45:33.957
TRYING TO FIND SOLUTIONS SO IF

02:45:34.024 --> 02:45:35.725
WE HIRE FACULTY WHO ARE INCLINED

02:45:35.792 --> 02:45:36.893
TO WORK OUTSIDE A SINGLE

02:45:36.960 --> 02:45:38.528
DISCIPLINE.

02:45:38.595 --> 02:45:40.630
WERE MORE LIKELY TO TO MAKE

02:45:40.697 --> 02:45:42.599
ADVANCES IN THE NOSE SOLVING THE

02:45:42.666 --> 02:45:44.834
WORLD'S PROBLEMS.

02:45:44.901 --> 02:45:46.636
I KNOW THAT UC RIVERSIDE

02:45:46.703 --> 02:45:47.304
RECENTLY.

02:45:47.370 --> 02:45:48.305
HIRED I THINK.

02:45:48.371 --> 02:45:50.974
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FIVE OR SEVEN

02:45:51.041 --> 02:45:52.742
AT NATIVE AMERICANS OF

02:45:52.809 --> 02:45:54.311
PROFESSORS AND I THINK THAT WAS

02:45:54.377 --> 02:45:55.745
IN A MONUMENTAL.

02:45:55.812 --> 02:45:57.947
A CERTAIN THAT WE WE HADN'T SEEN

02:45:58.014 --> 02:45:59.983
A ANYWHERE WOULD PROBABLY DON'T

02:46:00.050 --> 02:46:02.519
SEE IT AT ANY OTHER INSTITUTION.

02:46:02.585 --> 02:46:04.587
I ALSO READ HERE ARE THE THE.

02:46:04.654 --> 02:46:08.091
PRACTICE OF ASKING APPLICANTS

02:46:08.158 --> 02:46:09.526
TO WRITE ABOUT.

02:46:09.592 --> 02:46:12.529
TALK ABOUT A THEIR EXPERTISE AND

02:46:12.595 --> 02:46:15.332
IN TEACHING. I BELIEVE YES A THE

02:46:15.398 --> 02:46:16.866
THE POPULATION THAT THEY ARE

02:46:16.933 --> 02:46:17.801
TEACHING CAN YOU TALK MORE ABOUT

02:46:17.867 --> 02:46:19.602
THAT.

02:46:19.669 --> 02:46:20.370
SURE.

02:46:20.437 --> 02:46:22.972
NOW ALMOST ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES

02:46:23.039 --> 02:46:25.709
REQUIRE A ALL FACULTY APPLICANTS

02:46:25.775 --> 02:46:26.743
TO SUBMIT WHAT WE CALL A

02:46:26.810 --> 02:46:27.744
CONTRIBUTIONS TO DIVERSITY

02:46:27.811 --> 02:46:29.846
STATEMENT.

02:46:29.913 --> 02:46:31.181
AND IT.

02:46:31.247 --> 02:46:33.783
ENABLES THAT THOSE WHO HAVE

02:46:33.850 --> 02:46:35.819
DONE WORK IN THEIR TEACHING IN

02:46:35.885 --> 02:46:36.986
THEIR PRIOR RESEARCH OR EVEN

02:46:37.053 --> 02:46:38.455
OUTREACH.

02:46:38.521 --> 02:46:40.256
I TO TO DIVERSE COMMUNITIES TO

02:46:40.323 --> 02:46:41.558
TALK ABOUT THAT.

02:46:41.624 --> 02:46:43.760
THE.

02:46:43.827 --> 02:46:45.695
BUT MANY OF THE PILOTS HAVE MADE

02:46:45.762 --> 02:46:47.263
A CHANGE IN HOW THEY USE THOSE

02:46:47.330 --> 02:46:48.565
STATEMENTS WHICH I THINK HAS

02:46:48.631 --> 02:46:49.699
BEEN EFFECTIVE AND THEY'VE.

02:46:49.766 --> 02:46:51.601
FACTORED THEIR EVALUATION OF

02:46:51.668 --> 02:46:53.770
THOSE STATEMENTS ARE EARLY INTO

02:46:53.837 --> 02:46:55.805
THE PROCESS EARLIER IT RIVERSIDE

02:46:55.872 --> 02:46:57.273
FOR EXAMPLE IN THE ENGINEERING

02:46:57.340 --> 02:46:58.742
PILOT LAST YEAR.

02:46:58.808 --> 02:47:00.710
THAT THE FIRST CUT OF

02:47:00.777 --> 02:47:02.045
APPLICANTS.

02:47:02.112 --> 02:47:04.814
FOCUSED ARE MAINLY ON RESEARCH

02:47:04.881 --> 02:47:05.882
POTENTIAL IN RESEARCH

02:47:05.949 --> 02:47:07.584
ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND ON

02:47:07.650 --> 02:47:09.219
CONTRIBUTIONS TO DIVERSITY. AND

02:47:09.285 --> 02:47:11.354
THAT IS IN LARGE PART WHAT HELP

02:47:11.421 --> 02:47:13.723
THEM TO TRACK SUCH A.

02:47:13.790 --> 02:47:17.093
A DIVERSE FINALIST POOL AND

02:47:17.160 --> 02:47:18.661
THEN A DIVERSE POOL OF HIRES BUT

02:47:18.728 --> 02:47:19.829
THEY DID SOMETHING SIMILAR AT

02:47:19.896 --> 02:47:21.531
SAN DIEGO ALSO IN ENGINEERING

02:47:21.598 --> 02:47:23.099
LAST YEAR WHERE THEY.

02:47:23.166 --> 02:47:25.802
THAT THE FACULTY WERE TRAINED

02:47:25.869 --> 02:47:27.237
IN HOW TO READ THESE

02:47:27.303 --> 02:47:28.638
CONTRIBUTIONS TO DIVERSITY

02:47:28.705 --> 02:47:30.173
STATEMENTS AND MANY DISCIPLINES

02:47:30.240 --> 02:47:32.208
THIS IS A NEW. ISSUE.

02:47:32.275 --> 02:47:33.943
BUT IN A DISPLAY LIKE

02:47:34.010 --> 02:47:35.678
ENGINEERING IT THAT OFTEN THE

02:47:35.745 --> 02:47:37.847
FOCUS IS ON TEACHING BECAUSE

02:47:37.914 --> 02:47:39.516
THAT'S OF A COMPETENCY ALL

02:47:39.582 --> 02:47:42.018
FACULTY NEED NOW AT THE ABILITY

02:47:42.085 --> 02:47:42.552
TO TEACH A DIVERSE SET OF

02:47:42.619 --> 02:47:43.353
STUDENTS.

02:47:43.420 --> 02:47:46.523
.

02:47:46.589 --> 02:47:48.792
WE NOT TOO FAR BACK HAD A

02:47:48.858 --> 02:47:51.294
HEARING AT SAN JOSE STATE ON.

02:47:51.361 --> 02:47:54.364
DIVERSITY OF FACULTY A ACROSS

02:47:54.431 --> 02:47:56.199
THE THREE SYSTEMS.

02:47:56.266 --> 02:47:57.333
AND AND I WOULD.

02:47:57.400 --> 02:47:58.334
AND I REMEMBER.

02:47:58.401 --> 02:47:59.135
OF

02:47:59.202 --> 02:48:01.037
ASTRONOMER.

02:48:01.104 --> 02:48:03.139
OF FROM UC BERKELEY AND HE MADE

02:48:03.206 --> 02:48:05.408
THE STRONG STATEMENT THAT WE DO

02:48:05.475 --> 02:48:06.876
NOT HAVE MORE DIVERSITY.

02:48:06.943 --> 02:48:10.046
AND HIGHER EDUCATION AND HIS

02:48:10.113 --> 02:48:10.647
STATEMENT WAS BECAUSE WE DON'T

02:48:10.713 --> 02:48:12.482
WANT TO.

02:48:12.549 --> 02:48:14.083
SO I I THINK THE WILL AND IT

02:48:14.150 --> 02:48:15.919
NEEDS TO BE THERE.

02:48:15.985 --> 02:48:17.187
AND THE PRIORITY NEEDS TO BE

02:48:17.253 --> 02:48:18.087
GIVEN TO IT.

02:48:18.154 --> 02:48:20.089
.

02:48:20.156 --> 02:48:22.492
AND AND AGAIN.

02:48:22.559 --> 02:48:22.992
WE ARE MAKING VERY SLOW

02:48:23.059 --> 02:48:24.727
PROGRESS.

02:48:24.794 --> 02:48:26.563
TOWARDS THAT IF WE LOOK FORTY

02:48:26.629 --> 02:48:28.198
YEARS BACK

02:48:28.264 --> 02:48:30.233
THE THE THE PERCENTAGES OF.

02:48:30.300 --> 02:48:30.900
.

02:48:30.967 --> 02:48:32.669
.

02:48:32.735 --> 02:48:34.804
TENURED FACULTY OF COLOR HASN'T

02:48:34.871 --> 02:48:36.806
CHANGED MUCH AT ALL.

02:48:36.873 --> 02:48:37.006
AND.

02:48:37.073 --> 02:48:39.509
IT IS VERY SLOW PROGRESS AND.

02:48:39.576 --> 02:48:43.213
AGAIN I I WOULD ENCOURAGE UP

02:48:43.279 --> 02:48:45.014
ALL THREE SYSTEMS TO CONTINUE.

02:48:45.081 --> 02:48:45.648
TO.

02:48:45.715 --> 02:48:47.350
TO WORK AT IT.

02:48:47.417 --> 02:48:48.685
BECAUSE I THINK IT DOES MAKE A

02:48:48.751 --> 02:48:50.887
DIFFERENCE A TO THE SUCCESS OF

02:48:50.954 --> 02:48:51.521
OF THE STUDENTS THAT WE'RE WE'RE

02:48:51.588 --> 02:48:53.690
TEACHING.

02:48:53.756 --> 02:48:54.791
AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER DFI ME

02:48:54.858 --> 02:48:56.960
CIRCLE BACK FOR A MOMENT ONE.

02:48:57.026 --> 02:48:59.028
EXCELLO WHICH YOU ASKED ABOUT.

02:48:59.095 --> 02:49:01.197
THE DOCUMENT THAT ILLUSTRATES

02:49:01.264 --> 02:49:02.432
ALL OF THE SUMMARIES OF THE

02:49:02.499 --> 02:49:04.434
FUNDED PROPOSALS FOR THIS PAST

02:49:04.501 --> 02:49:05.935
YEAR INCLUDES A FIVE PARAGRAPH

02:49:06.002 --> 02:49:08.037
ONE SL LOW. AND THEY ARE

02:49:08.104 --> 02:49:09.906
PROPOSING LAUNCHING A CLUSTER

02:49:09.973 --> 02:49:12.008
HIGHER FOR TEN DEPARTMENTS TEN

02:49:12.075 --> 02:49:12.842
FACULTY MEMBER ACROSS

02:49:12.909 --> 02:49:14.577
DEPARTMENTS AND I ALSO HAVE SOME

02:49:14.644 --> 02:49:15.945
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WHICH

02:49:16.012 --> 02:49:17.480
TALKS ABOUT CLUSTER HIRES THAT

02:49:17.547 --> 02:49:19.916
WAS THAT THEY HAVE ALREADY DONE.

02:49:19.983 --> 02:49:22.151
IN THE COLLEGE OF LIBERAL ARTS

02:49:22.218 --> 02:49:25.255
AND ALSO IN MATH AND SCIENCE ON

02:49:25.321 --> 02:49:27.090
THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS OTHER

02:49:27.156 --> 02:49:28.591
INFORMATION THOUGH SO I CAN PEEL

02:49:28.658 --> 02:49:30.593
OUT THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION TO

02:49:30.660 --> 02:49:32.161
PROVIDE TO YOU. THANK YOU YOU'RE

02:49:32.228 --> 02:49:33.429
WELCOME AND AND I KNOW WILL

02:49:33.496 --> 02:49:35.298
CONTINUE TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS ON

02:49:35.365 --> 02:49:35.632
ON THE STOP.

02:49:35.698 --> 02:49:38.201
THANK YOU.

02:49:38.268 --> 02:49:40.069
THANK YOU MISTER MARTZ ITCHY

02:49:40.136 --> 02:49:42.205
THANK YOU VERY MUCH I.

02:49:42.272 --> 02:49:44.507
THIS A SUBJECT TO.

02:49:44.574 --> 02:49:46.543
REMINDS ME OF HOW WHEN I WAS A

02:49:46.609 --> 02:49:49.112
STUDENT AT UCLA LAW SCHOOL WE

02:49:49.178 --> 02:49:49.412
WOULD BE.

02:49:49.479 --> 02:49:52.715
ADVOCATING FOR MORE FACULTY

02:49:52.782 --> 02:49:53.583
DIVERSITY AND.

02:49:53.650 --> 02:49:55.518
AND WE WOULD HAVE.

02:49:55.585 --> 02:49:58.621
DEMONSTRATIONS IN PETITIONS.

02:49:58.688 --> 02:50:00.323
AND THEN WE WILL GET SOMEONE.

02:50:00.390 --> 02:50:02.392
AND THEN THE RELIEF.

02:50:02.458 --> 02:50:02.992
SO.

02:50:03.059 --> 02:50:04.561
THE RETENTION IS THERE

02:50:04.627 --> 02:50:05.595
SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE BEEN

02:50:05.662 --> 02:50:07.397
TALKING ABOUT ALSO. ESPECIALLY

02:50:07.463 --> 02:50:09.532
WHERE.

02:50:09.599 --> 02:50:11.301
IT SEEMS LIKE BECAUSE THE POOL

02:50:11.367 --> 02:50:12.669
IS SO SMALL THAT.

02:50:12.735 --> 02:50:14.938
THEY THEY. THE THAT THE

02:50:15.004 --> 02:50:15.204
TALENTED.

02:50:15.271 --> 02:50:15.805
.

02:50:15.872 --> 02:50:17.807
.

02:50:17.874 --> 02:50:20.143
FACULTY OF COLOR ARE HIGHLY

02:50:20.209 --> 02:50:23.146
SOUGHT AFTER ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

02:50:23.212 --> 02:50:26.482
SO OF FOR ALL THREE SEGMENTS IN

02:50:26.549 --> 02:50:28.217
THE WATER WHAT ARE THE THEY THAT

02:50:28.284 --> 02:50:29.886
THEY'RE. THE MOST.

02:50:29.953 --> 02:50:31.688
SUCCESSFUL OR COMPELLING

02:50:31.754 --> 02:50:34.390
ARGUMENTS AS TO WHY TO COME AND

02:50:34.457 --> 02:50:38.428
TO STAY. AT UC CSU ARE ARE ARE

02:50:38.494 --> 02:50:41.898
CALIFORNIA CAN BE COLLEGES.

02:50:41.965 --> 02:50:43.299
ORDER AND I WOULD IMAGINE THERE

02:50:43.366 --> 02:50:44.467
BE WIDE VARIATION A DEPENDING ON

02:50:44.534 --> 02:50:47.270
THE CAMPUS AND DEPARTMENT AND

02:50:47.337 --> 02:50:48.438
AND DISCIPLINE IN.

02:50:48.504 --> 02:50:48.905
IN OUR GREAT RESEARCH

02:50:48.972 --> 02:50:50.974
FACILITIES.

02:50:51.040 --> 02:50:53.176
BUTTA ARE IS OUR TH ONE BIG

02:50:53.242 --> 02:50:55.345
ROTH FLOOR AT DIVERSE FACULTY IS

02:50:55.411 --> 02:50:56.679
OUR DIVERSE STUDENT BODY OF

02:50:56.746 --> 02:50:58.281
FACULTY WANT TO WORK WITH OUR

02:50:58.348 --> 02:51:00.183
STUDENTS AND DAY THEY FIND IT

02:51:00.249 --> 02:51:02.285
QUITE COMPELLING.

02:51:02.352 --> 02:51:02.852
TO

02:51:02.919 --> 02:51:04.687
TO TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:51:04.754 --> 02:51:05.989
WHICH WE WORK WITH SUCH A

02:51:06.055 --> 02:51:07.523
DIVERSE STUDENT BODY SO I THINK

02:51:07.590 --> 02:51:09.225
THAT'S PROBABLY BUT. THE ONE OF

02:51:09.292 --> 02:51:12.528
THE TOP WAYS WE CAN RECRUIT.

02:51:12.595 --> 02:51:12.795
AND IT'S.

02:51:12.862 --> 02:51:14.497
.

02:51:14.564 --> 02:51:16.299
BUT INDEED A GREAT AUNT TOOL

02:51:16.366 --> 02:51:17.200
THAT WE HAVE.

02:51:17.266 --> 02:51:19.168
AT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE

02:51:19.235 --> 02:51:21.604
ALSO FOUND HELPS ONCE WEEK

02:51:21.671 --> 02:51:22.238
WRITTEN.

02:51:22.305 --> 02:51:24.240
RECRUIT THOSE FACULTY RETAIN

02:51:24.307 --> 02:51:24.707
THEM.

02:51:24.774 --> 02:51:27.076
IS TO BE SURE THEY'RE FINDING

02:51:27.143 --> 02:51:28.611
THE RIGHT COMMUNITY NOT JUST

02:51:28.678 --> 02:51:30.313
AMONG THEIR STUDENTS BUT AMONG

02:51:30.380 --> 02:51:31.447
THEIR PEERS.

02:51:31.514 --> 02:51:32.982
AND I MENTIONED EARLIER THE

02:51:33.049 --> 02:51:34.250
PRESIDENT'S POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWS

02:51:34.317 --> 02:51:35.551
PROGRAM.

02:51:35.618 --> 02:51:37.587
SIMILAR TO THAT PROGRAM AT CSU

02:51:37.654 --> 02:51:39.589
WHICH WE'VE HAD FOR OVER THIRTY

02:51:39.656 --> 02:51:40.223
YEARS AND IT.

02:51:40.289 --> 02:51:42.025
BRINGS IN A COHORT OF NEW

02:51:42.091 --> 02:51:43.526
POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWS IN ALL

02:51:43.593 --> 02:51:45.194
DISCIPLINES.

02:51:45.261 --> 02:51:47.864
WHEN THAT WE NOW BRING IN ABOUT.

02:51:47.930 --> 02:51:49.899
OVER THIRTY YEARS WE HAVE

02:51:49.966 --> 02:51:51.401
ROUGHLY SAY THAT IT'S A TO YOUR

02:51:51.467 --> 02:51:52.802
PROBLEMS SEVENTY OF THOSE

02:51:52.869 --> 02:51:54.537
FELLOWS EVERY YEAR AND OVER

02:51:54.604 --> 02:51:55.438
THIRTY YEARS WE'VE BUILT A

02:51:55.505 --> 02:51:58.541
COMMUNITY. ACROSS THE SYSTEM AND

02:51:58.608 --> 02:52:01.010
OUR PRIMARY GOAL FOR RUNNING

02:52:01.077 --> 02:52:02.745
THAT PROGRAM IS TO RECRUIT THOSE

02:52:02.812 --> 02:52:04.747
AMAZINGLY TALENTED OF FELLOWS

02:52:04.814 --> 02:52:06.549
INTO THE FACULTY BUT ONCE THEY

02:52:06.616 --> 02:52:07.650
GET INTO THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE

02:52:07.717 --> 02:52:09.686
A READY MADE. NETWORK ACROSS THE

02:52:09.752 --> 02:52:10.753
SYSTEM.

02:52:10.820 --> 02:52:11.521
DEAD.

02:52:11.587 --> 02:52:13.289
ENABLES THEM TO TALK ABOUT

02:52:13.356 --> 02:52:14.857
WHAT'S NOT GOING SO WELL

02:52:14.924 --> 02:52:16.059
CRITICALLY WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:52:16.125 --> 02:52:17.627
NOT AND I'M IN THE POSITION TO

02:52:17.694 --> 02:52:19.529
EVALUATE THEM. AND THEN WE JUST

02:52:19.595 --> 02:52:20.596
STARTED.

02:52:20.663 --> 02:52:23.599
THREE YEARS AGO. A.

02:52:23.666 --> 02:52:25.468
EXIT AND RETENTION SURVEY OF OUR

02:52:25.535 --> 02:52:27.103
FACULTY

02:52:27.170 --> 02:52:28.337
SO THAT WE WOULD HAVE BETTER

02:52:28.404 --> 02:52:29.772
DATA ON.

02:52:29.839 --> 02:52:32.308
WHY FACULTY DO LEAVE AND WHY

02:52:32.375 --> 02:52:33.576
THEY STAY?

02:52:33.643 --> 02:52:33.843
AND IT'S.

02:52:33.910 --> 02:52:35.712
.

02:52:35.778 --> 02:52:38.548
OTHER FINDINGS ARE NOT.

02:52:38.614 --> 02:52:40.283
SO SURPRISING BUT WE ACTUALLY

02:52:40.349 --> 02:52:42.251
HAVE DATA FOR THE FIRST TIME

02:52:42.318 --> 02:52:43.653
THAT CONFIRMS.

02:52:43.720 --> 02:52:46.122
WHAT WE THOUGHT WE KNEW ABOUT

02:52:46.189 --> 02:52:47.423
WHY FACULTY LEAVING MY THE STATE

02:52:47.490 --> 02:52:49.459
WHAT WE DON'T HAVE YET BECAUSE

02:52:49.525 --> 02:52:49.959
THE NUMBERS ARE SMALLER?

02:52:50.026 --> 02:52:51.060
?

02:52:51.127 --> 02:52:52.528
IT IS THE ABILITY TO.

02:52:52.595 --> 02:52:54.230
DISAGGREGATED THOSE FINDINGS

02:52:54.297 --> 02:52:55.998
ACROSS THAT WE CAN DO IT BY

02:52:56.065 --> 02:52:57.600
GENDER BUT WE CAN'T YET DO IT BY

02:52:57.667 --> 02:52:59.669
RACE AND ETHNICITY.

02:52:59.736 --> 02:53:01.037
SO YOU THEIR DATA IS

02:53:01.104 --> 02:53:02.138
INSUFFICIENT TO.

02:53:02.205 --> 02:53:04.073
TRY TO.

02:53:04.140 --> 02:53:05.608
TO DRAW IT TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW

02:53:05.675 --> 02:53:07.410
WHY WHY DO ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN

02:53:07.477 --> 02:53:09.278
FACULTY LEAVE OR STAY ONE WHAT'S

02:53:09.345 --> 02:53:11.914
COMPELLING OR WHY DO AT LATINO

02:53:11.981 --> 02:53:13.783
FACT BELIEVERS TODAY. UP BUT I

02:53:13.850 --> 02:53:15.384
CAN TELL YOU ONE ONE OF THE

02:53:15.451 --> 02:53:18.254
FINDINGS FOR ALL FACULTY AND IS

02:53:18.321 --> 02:53:18.454
THAT.

02:53:18.521 --> 02:53:19.355
.

02:53:19.422 --> 02:53:21.257
SALARY MATTERS YOU KNOW THEIR

02:53:21.324 --> 02:53:22.458
ABILITY TO.

02:53:22.525 --> 02:53:25.261
LIVE IN IN OUR STATE.

02:53:25.328 --> 02:53:27.630
IS A BIG ISSUE FOR. THE FACULTY

02:53:27.697 --> 02:53:28.998
BUT THE QUALITY OF THEIR

02:53:29.065 --> 02:53:30.566
STUDENTS AND COLLEAGUES IS RIGHT

02:53:30.633 --> 02:53:33.569
THERE AS WELL.

02:53:33.636 --> 02:53:35.037
AND I WOULD ALMOST ECHO

02:53:35.104 --> 02:53:36.539
EVERYTHING THAT MY COLLEAGUE

02:53:36.606 --> 02:53:38.908
SHARED AS WELL ON TO MY EARLIER

02:53:38.975 --> 02:53:41.177
COMMENT ABOUT HIRING SOMEONE IS

02:53:41.244 --> 02:53:42.779
JUST THE FIRST STEP IN AND

02:53:42.845 --> 02:53:44.180
PAYING A LOT MORE ATTENTION

02:53:44.247 --> 02:53:45.748
FOCUSED ON INCLUSION AND WHY

02:53:45.815 --> 02:53:47.717
PEOPLE ARE LEAVING. ON OUR

02:53:47.784 --> 02:53:49.619
CAMPUSES ARE DOING A BETTER JOB

02:53:49.685 --> 02:53:51.888
I'M A GREAT JOB ON MOST OF THE

02:53:51.954 --> 02:53:53.356
BUILDING COMMUNITIES OF SUPPORT

02:53:53.422 --> 02:53:54.690
NOT ONLY FOR THE FACULTY MEMBER

02:53:54.757 --> 02:53:56.726
BUT ALSO FOR THE FAMILY AND AND

02:53:56.793 --> 02:53:58.361
FILLED. HER THE TROOP COMMUNITY

02:53:58.427 --> 02:54:00.062
IN THAT AREA THEY LIVE IN A BUT

02:54:00.129 --> 02:54:02.165
WE CERTAINLY HAVE CHALLENGES

02:54:02.231 --> 02:54:03.366
WITH SALARIES.

02:54:03.432 --> 02:54:04.867
AND THE COST OF LIVING.

02:54:04.934 --> 02:54:06.335
WE ALL KNOW WHAT THAT LOOKS

02:54:06.402 --> 02:54:07.770
LIKE AND SO THAT'S THAT'S A

02:54:07.837 --> 02:54:09.906
LARGE PIECE OF COMING OF OUR

02:54:09.972 --> 02:54:11.574
PRELIMINARY DATA AS WELL. PA BUT

02:54:11.641 --> 02:54:12.975
THERE AND AT BUT CERTAINLY THE

02:54:13.042 --> 02:54:14.777
MISSION AND THE THE STE THE

02:54:14.844 --> 02:54:16.512
STUDENT POPULATION I THINK IS IS

02:54:16.579 --> 02:54:18.815
PROBABLY THE NUMBER ONE REASON

02:54:18.881 --> 02:54:22.618
THE MOST TO DO STAY INTERESTED.

02:54:22.685 --> 02:54:23.820
AGAIN IT WOULD BE FOR THE

02:54:23.886 --> 02:54:25.855
COMMUNICATIVE SYSTEM CERTAINLY

02:54:25.922 --> 02:54:26.422
THE MISSION OF THE COMMUNITY

02:54:26.489 --> 02:54:27.256
COLLEGES.

02:54:27.323 --> 02:54:29.659
AND THE INCREDIBLY DIVERSE

02:54:29.725 --> 02:54:31.260
STUDENT BODY THAT WE SERVE SO I

02:54:31.327 --> 02:54:32.728
WOULD I WOULD POINT OUT AS FAR

02:54:32.795 --> 02:54:34.063
AS THE IMPORTANCE OF OF

02:54:34.130 --> 02:54:35.865
RETENTION AND IT'S IT'S A

02:54:35.932 --> 02:54:37.366
CENTRAL BECAUSE AS YOU POINTED

02:54:37.433 --> 02:54:38.701
OUT THERE'S.

02:54:38.768 --> 02:54:40.203
GETTING SOMEONE THE DOORS ONE

02:54:40.269 --> 02:54:40.770
THING BUT IF YOU CAN'T KEEP

02:54:40.837 --> 02:54:41.671
THEM.

02:54:41.737 --> 02:54:43.372
THEN YOU HAVEN'T YOU HAVEN'T

02:54:43.439 --> 02:54:45.341
GOTTEN ANYWHERE SO THREE OF THE

02:54:45.408 --> 02:54:46.943
NINE MULTIPLE METHODS THAT WE

02:54:47.009 --> 02:54:48.244
USE THAT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE

02:54:48.311 --> 02:54:49.879
FOR ALLOCATING  <u>&lt;c.green&gt;O. FUNDING&lt;/c&gt;</u>

02:54:49.946 --> 02:54:51.781
RELATE TO. A POST HIRING AND

02:54:51.848 --> 02:54:52.815
RETENTION.

02:54:52.882 --> 02:54:54.016
IN THE INCLUDE.

02:54:54.083 --> 02:54:56.385
WHETHER OUR DISTRICTS HAVE A

02:54:56.452 --> 02:54:58.087
PROFESSIONAL DO WELL DEVELOPMENT

02:54:58.154 --> 02:54:58.721
PROGRAMS ARE FOCUSED ON

02:54:58.788 --> 02:54:59.822
DIVERSITY.

02:54:59.889 --> 02:55:01.357
WHETHER A DIVERSITY IS

02:55:01.424 --> 02:55:03.292
INCORPORATED INTO CRITERIA FOR

02:55:03.359 --> 02:55:04.861
EMPLOYEE EVALUATION AND TENURE

02:55:04.927 --> 02:55:06.229
REVIEW WHICH I THINK IS ACTUALLY

02:55:06.295 --> 02:55:07.730
A VERY INTERESTING ONE. AT THE

02:55:07.797 --> 02:55:10.233
HAS TO BE NEGOTIATED LOCAL WE.

02:55:10.299 --> 02:55:10.466
WITH.

02:55:10.533 --> 02:55:11.767
WITH UNIONS.

02:55:11.834 --> 02:55:12.969
AND THEN.

02:55:13.035 --> 02:55:14.403
GROW YOUR OWN PROGRAMS WE'VE.

02:55:14.470 --> 02:55:16.472
WE'VE HAD A A FLOWERING OF.

02:55:16.539 --> 02:55:18.641
MENTORSHIP PROGRAMS ARE FOCUSED

02:55:18.708 --> 02:55:19.709
ON DIVERSITY THAT ARE.

02:55:19.775 --> 02:55:21.644
AIMS TO DO JUST THAT IS TO

02:55:21.711 --> 02:55:24.914
RETAIN UR OUR DIVERSE FACULTY.

02:55:24.981 --> 02:55:26.616
ALRIGHT AND.

02:55:26.682 --> 02:55:28.117
ONE LAST QUESTION I I. I KNOW

02:55:28.184 --> 02:55:28.317
THAT.

02:55:28.384 --> 02:55:31.087
.

02:55:31.153 --> 02:55:31.320
ASIANS.

02:55:31.387 --> 02:55:33.055
.

02:55:33.122 --> 02:55:35.291
CAN SOMETIMES BE INCLUDED AND

02:55:35.358 --> 02:55:37.627
AND THESE DIVERSITY PROGRAMS AND

02:55:37.693 --> 02:55:38.394
SOMETIMES ARE NOT.

02:55:38.461 --> 02:55:40.696
SEVERAL MENTIONED AT DIFFERENT

02:55:40.763 --> 02:55:41.197
TIMES UNDER REPRESENTED

02:55:41.264 --> 02:55:43.933

02:55:47.637 --> 02:55:51.774
ASIANS.

02:55:51.841 --> 02:55:53.542
AND THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION SO SO

02:55:53.609 --> 02:55:55.645
WHEN WE USE UNDERREPRESENTED

02:55:55.711 --> 02:55:58.247

02:56:07.323 --> 02:56:09.759
FACULTY OF COLOR AND AND IT

02:56:09.825 --> 02:56:12.128
REALLY VARIES BY DISCIPLINE.

02:56:12.194 --> 02:56:14.530
HOW REPRESENTED ARE

02:56:14.597 --> 02:56:16.565

02:56:20.870 --> 02:56:22.305
CONCERNS HAS BEEN.

02:56:22.371 --> 02:56:24.373

A LOT OF THINGS THAT YOU KNOW I

02:56:26.809 --> 02:56:28.511
GET FOLDED INTO ASIAN SUB SUB

02:56:28.577 --> 02:56:31.747
AGE PERCEPTIBLY LESIONS OF.

CONCERNED THAT THEY'RE NOT

02:56:38.220 --> 02:56:40.323
SEEING A ASIAN FACULTY ON

02:56:40.389 --> 02:56:41.791
TEACHING THEIR COURSE ISN'T IN

ACTUALLY ILLUSTRATES A I'M.

02:57:43.886 --> 02:57:45.688
A FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE ON

02:57:45.755 --> 02:57:46.789
IT WE WENT FROM TWENTY THREE

02:57:46.856 --> 02:57:48.557

STUDENT PARENTS THESE OTHER

03:24:06.634 --> 03:24:07.335
PEOPLE DISPROPORTIONATELY

03:24:07.401 --> 03:24:08.903
IMPACTED BY BASIC NEEDS AND

03:24:08.970 --> 03:24:10.738
SECURITY. WE TALK A LOT ABOUT

THEM PARTS OF CAMPUS DIVERSITY

03:24:12.306 --> 03:24:13.341
BUT WHAT'S REALLY CRUCIAL IS

03:24:13.407 --> 03:24:15.042
ACTUALLY FUNDING ADVERSITY AND

03:24:15.109 --> 03:24:15.943
THIS INCLUDES FUNDING FOR

03:24:21.649 --> 03:24:24.485
RATHER THAN WORRYING ABOUT

03:24:24.552 --> 03:24:25.119
WHETHER GOING TO GET THEIR NEXT

03:24:25.186 --> 03:24:25.419
MEAL FROM.

03:24:25.486 --> 03:24:26.821
FOOD SECURITY IN EFFORTS MUST BE

03:24:26.887 --> 03:24:27.855
EXPANDED AND KOREANS WITH IT

03:24:27.922 --> 03:24:28.990
WILL INCREASES.

03:24:29.056 --> 03:24:30.257
THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

03:24:30.324 --> 03:24:31.525
EDUCATES NINE THOUSAND MORE

03:24:31.592 --> 03:24:32.193

03:24:32.259 --> 03:24:33.828
TWO THOUSAND THE STATE FUNDING

03:24:33.894 --> 03:24:35.463
HAS REMAINED THE SAME. AND THIS

03:24:35.529 --> 03:24:36.397
DOESN'T JUSTIFY STUDENTS BASIC

03:24:36.464 --> 03:24:38.466
NEEDS INSUFFICIENT FUNDS ALSO

03:24:38.532 --> 03:24:39.800
IMPACT COURSE AVAILABILITY

MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES.

03:24:44.605 --> 03:24:45.873
SO IF STATE INVESTMENT HIGHER

03:24:45.940 --> 03:24:47.208
EDUCATION IS INADEQUATE THE

03:24:47.274 --> 03:24:48.609
FINANCIAL BURDEN FALLS ON

03:24:48.676 --> 03:24:49.377

I WANT TO TALK TODAY A LITTLE

03:25:08.162 --> 03:25:09.263
BIT ABOUT THE DISPARITY BETWEEN

03:25:50.037 --> 03:25:50.604
IF TACKLE IF PROFESSORS DON'T
