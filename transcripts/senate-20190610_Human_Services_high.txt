THREE FORTY FOUR WHICH ESTABLISHES A NEW BEGINNINGS CALIFORNIA PROGRAM HERE -- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- WHICH IS IT IS ESSENTIALLY A MATCHING PROGRAM FOR CITIES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COUNTIES -- TO ASK FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY UP TO FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS -- THAT THEY'RE ALREADY PUTTING UP ON THERE AND TO TRY AND PUT TOGETHER A PROGRAM WHILE WORKING WITH -- DIFFERENT WRAPAROUND SERVICES -- TO PUT INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESS HOMELESSNESS TO WORK BY PERFORMING SOME TYPE OF CITY WORK AND WE'VE SEEN THIS HAPPEN NOT JUST INSERTED CITIES IN CALIFORNIA BUT ALSO -- CERTAIN OTHER STATES ARE DOING AND OTHER MAJOR CITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY ARE DOING AND THEY'VE SEEN A LOT OF SUCCESS FOR THE FOR THOSE THAT YOU KNOW REALLY ARE DOWN AND OUT AND THEY JUST NEED SOME. WORK TO EARN SOME ONEY TO GET A PLACE SO THAT THEY CAN THEN MOVE THEMSELVES OUT OF THEIR SITUATION OF BEING HOMELESS -- THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT HAS HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS IN IN IN OTHER AREAS AND SO I THINK THAT IS IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THIS THIS STATE. CONSIDERS A POLICY LIKE THIS TO ALLOW OUR CITIES TO HAVE ANOTHER TOOL IN ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS -- WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT I MEAN WE WE UNDERSTAND THE SCOPE OF HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S BETTER TO HAVE MORE TOOLS TOOLS ON THE TABLE THERE HAS TO BE BY IN FROM THE STATE OBVIOUSLY OUR BUDGET IS A REFLECTION OF OUR VALUES. WHEN IT COMES TO THAT -- AND WE PUT OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MORE ABOUT THIS BUT WE JUST HAVE SUCH A LARGE POPULATION LARGEST OF ANY OTHERS -- ANY OTHER STATE IN THE NATION. GRAND WE ARE THE BIGGEST -- WE HAVE A LARGE POPULATION SO MAKE SENSE -- BUT WE JUST NEED MORE TOOLS IN THIS IS AN EXCELLENT TOOL TO HELP. CITIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS% THAT HAVE ACCESS TO A COUPLE MORE DOLLARS TO PUT TOGETHER PROGRAM TO TO PUT THE FOLKS ARE EXPERIENCING HOMES TO WORK AT OR ABOVE MINIMUM WAGE WE LEAVE THAT UP TO THE CITY BUT AT LEAST GONNA BE PAYING THEM. A MINIMUM WAGE JOB TO HELP LIFT THEMSELVES OUT OF HOMELESSNESS. SO -- WHAT THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE IN WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT? THAT IS FRIENDS IN DC ON NOW WHO IS THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF UNITED WAY OF STANISLAUS COUNTY. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- AS SENATOR CALDERON SAID I AM THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED WAY OF STANISLAUS COUNTY PROUD MEMBER THE UNITED WAYS OF CALIFORNIA. OUR STATEWIDE NETWORK OF UNITED WAYS IS PLEASE A STRONGLY UPHOLD SUPPORT AB THREE FORTY FOUR BY SIMPLY MAJORITY LEADER CALDERON WHICH WILL BENEFIT THE NEW BEGINNINGS CALIFORNIA GRANT PROGRAM. AB THREE FORTY FOUR WILL PROVIDE MATCHING FUNDS TO ELIGIBLE SEASON COUNTIES TO IMPLEMENT OR EXPAND EMPLOYMENT PER WAS FOR INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. AS WE ALL KNOW CALIFORNIA IS IN THE MIDST OF A HOMELESS CRISIS WITH THE NATION'S LARGEST HOMELESS POPULATION AN INDICATION OF THIS CRISIS IS SOUTH COUNTY'S AMPLIFIED BY THE RESULTS FROM OUR POINT TIME COUNT. OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN ARE HOMELESS POPULATION IS INCREASED BY NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY INDIVIDUALS THIS YEAR TOTALING OVER. NINETEEN HUNDRED UNITED WAYS ACROSS CALIFORNIA ARE DEEPLY INVOLVED IN ADDRESSING LOCAL HOMELESSNESS CHALLENGES. THE NEW BEGINNINGS GRANT PROGRAM IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TO MOVE HOMELESS FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS IN THE HOUSING AND FINANCIAL STABILITY. IS OUTSIDE COUNTY WE'VE BEEN PURSUING A PURSUING A WIDE ARRAY OF STRATEGIES TO AID THOSE IN NEED OF HOUSING IS A PART OF SERVICES. WE NOW HAVE A TEMPORARY EMERGENCY OUTDOOR SHELTER WAS SUPPORT SERVICES AND WE'RE IN THE FINAL STAGES OF PLANNING AND ACCESS CENTER AND A LITTLE BEAR SHELTER. IN ADDITION THE AYE WAY STANISLAUS COUNTY IN PARTNERSHIP THE CITY MODESTO STANISLAUS COUNTY AND THE COMMUNITY FOUNDATION I FOUND A HUGE WIN IN A PROGRAM CALLED DOWNTOWN STREET TEAM. BASED OUT OF SAN JOSE THIS PROGRAM IS NOW IN THIRTEEN CALIFORNIA CITIES THIS HOMES WORK EXPERIENCE PROGRAM EMPOWERS INDIVIDUALS AND ACTS AS A STEPPING STONE. INTO EMPLOYMENT HOUSING AND A BETTER LIFE IT ALSO BENEFITS THE ENVIRONMENT AND OUR COMMUNITY BY PROVIDING CLEAN UP ALONG ALLEYS STREET AND OUR DOWNTOWN AREA. THE PROJECT BEGAN FEBRUARY EIGHTEENTH AND CURRENTLY THERE ARE THIRTY FIVE HOMELESS TEAM MEMBERS INVOLVED WITH FIFTEEN ON A WAIT LIST. IN NEARLY FOUR MEN'S MEN'S TEAM MEMBERS HAVE WORKED OVER FIVE THOUSAND HOURS HAVE COLLECTED WELL OVER FORTY THOUSAND POUNDS OF TRASH. FOR THEIR WORK THEIR PAIN GIVE CA BASIC NEEDS. TEAM MEMBERS BILL CONFIDENCE RECEIVE HOUSING AND JOB PLACEMENT COMPLETE RESUMES AND SET GOALS PLUS. THEY RECEIVE MANY OTHER SUPPORTIVE SERVICES. HE MEMBERS HAVE ALSO TAKEN ON LEADERSHIP ROLES. THE DIRECTOR OF THE DOWNTOWN STREET TEAM MODESTO PROGRAM STATED MANY HAVE GONE FROM VERY LITTLE MOTIVATION FOR WORK AND OTHER GOALS TO BE HIGHLY MOTIVATED. SUCCESS ALSO LOOKS LIKE A VET NAME RAY WHO HAD TWENTY PLUS YEARS IN MANUFACTURING CAREER. AFTER GETTING LAID OFF HE FOUND HIMSELF HOMELESS IT WAS NOT AWARE THE RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR HIM AS A HOMELESS FAT. HE STARTED WORKING WITH THE DOWNTOWN STREET CASE MANAGER RECENTLY HE RECEIVED A HOUSING VOUCHER. AND DOWNTOWN STREET IS WORKING WITH HIM TO FIND AN APARTMENT. I HAVE SEEN FOR MYSELF FOR MY WORK IN STANISLAUS COUNTY THE TRANSFORMATIVE POWER THAT CAN PICK COMPENSATION FOR A DAY'S WORK. FAIR WAGES INCLUSION AND DIGNITY HAVE TO BUILD SELF ESTEEM LEFT INDIVIDUALSUP AND OUT OF POVERTY. FURTHER AND PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY PROGRAMS LIKE DOWNTOWN STREET TEAM AND THE ONES ENVISIONED AND AB THREE FORTY FOUR WILL DEMONSTRATE THEIR VALUE TO THE ENTIRE COMMUNITIES. AB THREE FORTY FOUR WOULD ALLOW LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO THEIR UNIQUE NEEDS AND TO BUILD ON THE SUCCESSES COUNTY LIKE OURS HAVE RECEIVED HAVE EXPERIENCED. IN THE WORDS AND ONE OF THE DOWNTOWN STREET MEMBERS AS HE DESCRIBED THE PROGRAM TO NEW MEMBERS AT THEIR WEEKLY MEETING WE ARE HERE TO LIFT YOU UP AND TO LIFT YOU OUT OF WHERE YOU ARE. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT PLEASE COME UP AND STATE YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION. THE MEASUREMENT KEITH ON HER BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION I APPRECIATE THE WORDS OF THE UNITED WAY WOULD JUST ENDORSE THEM AND ALSO SAY THAT WE AGREE THAT. PROVIDING PEOPLE PASSED TO BE EMPLOYED IN INVESTED IN THEMSELVES IS ANOTHER GREAT TOOL TO GET A HOMELESSNESS WE NEED TO USE ALL THE TOOLS WE HAVE. TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS AND WE WOULD ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. TAKE A BREAK A WITH THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORK CALIFORNIA CHAPTER IN STRONG SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON ERIC FLOOR AS WITH THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE ASSOCIATION ON BEHALF OF THE FORTY FIVE LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD'S IN CALIFORNIA IN STRONG SUPPORT. WE HAVE ANY OF WITNESSES HERE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. ARE THERE ANY FURTHER WITNESSES. SO -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CALDERON AT THIS MOMENT WE DON'T HAVE QUORUM. BUDGET -- ONCE WE I HAVE QUORUM WILL GO AHEAD AND TAKE UP THIS BILL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR CENTERS APPRECIATE YOUR TIME SORRY PARDON ME CLOSE. WOULD YOU LIKE -- TO COMMENTER ASK ANY QUESTIONS TO MEMBERS OF COMMITTEE. NOT [inaudible] OKAY. FEEL FREE TO CLOSE THIS RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR OF OPEN THE TIME IS APPROPRIATE THANK YOU THANK YOU [inaudible] FOR OKAY. SO NEXT UP IS THE A. B. FOUR FOUR SEVEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON [inaudible] WELCOME. PLEASE FEEL FREE TO PRESENT A VALID THANK WHATEVER YOU'RE READY [inaudible] THANK YOU. MEDICARE THANK YOU APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY AND MEMBERS -- TO BE HERE -- PRESENTING -- AB FOUR FOUR SEVEN WHICH WILL SIMPLIFY ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES FOR OWNERS AND OPERATORS OF RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES. FOR THE ELDERLY I WOULD LIKE TO THANK SENATOR WIENER AGAIN FOR CO AUTHORING. THIS MEASURE WITH ME AGAIN APPRECIATE THAT VERY VERY MUCH RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES PROVIDE. A COMFORTING SAFE ALTERNATIVE FOR CALIFORNIANS WHERE THEY CAN AGE IN A HOME LIKE COMMUNITY. AND A BEFORE FOR SEVEN UP WILL MAKE IT EASIER WE THINK FOR THESE HOMES TO OPERATE AND TO SERVE. THESE INDIVIDUALS THIS BILL INSURERS AND THAT AN OPERATOR SUCH A FACILITY CAN SEAMLESSLY TRANSFER AN EMPLOYEE. WHO HAS SUCCESSFULLY BEEN CLEARED OF A BACK HAVE A BACKGROUND CHECK FROM ONE HOME TO ANOTHER? THIS ALLOWS EACH OF THE FACILITIES TO BE MORE APPROPRIATELY STAFF WHEN AN EMPLOYEE IS SICK AS A FAMILY EMERGENCY. OR OTHER SITUATION. AS THE LAW IS WRITTEN TODAY A LICENSEE MONTHS MUST SEEK APPROVAL FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO TRANSFER AN EMPLOYEE ALONG WITH HIS OR HER BACKGROUND CHECK TO A DIFFERENT FACILITY. FROM THE ONE TO WHICH THEY ARE CURRENTLY. ASSIGNED THIS PROCESS DOES NOT ADEQUATELY ALLOW FOR LAST MINUTE STAFFING SHORTAGES OR CHANGES -- SIMPLY CREE X. THAT CREATES EXTRA WORK FOR BOTH THE FACILITY -- OWNER AND THE DEPARTMENT IF THEY LICENSE. DOES TRANSFER AN EMPLOYEE PRIOR TO APPROVAL FROM THE DEPARTMENT THE LICENSEE CAN BE FINED. A HUNDRED DOLLARS PER DAY MAYBE UP TO AS MUCH AS FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER DAY. SO AB FOUR FOUR SEVEN WOULD SIMPLIFY THIS PROCESS AND ALLOW CARE FACILITY ICENSEE. TO INSTEAD MAINTAIN A COMPLETE AND CURRENT LIST OF ALL EMPLOYEES WITH CLEARED BACKGROUND CHECKS THAT WORK AT ANY OR ALL OF THEIR FACILITIES AND WOULD NO LONGER FORCE THEM TO ASSIGN EMPLOYEES TO WANT ONLY ONE FACILITY. AT A TIME -- THESE LISTS WILL ALSO BE UPDATED AT LEAST ONCE PER YEAR -- AND MORE OFTEN THAN THAT IF PROMPTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES I HAVE HERE TODAY ROCKS AND GOLD REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA ASSISTED LIVING ASSOCIATION. AND GEORGE COULD MERION WITH SIX BEDS -- TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK YOU MEASURE. THANK YOU THANK YOU FROM THE PATTERSON AND SENATOR WIENER -- ADD MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND ROCK SINGLE THEM ACTUALLY REPRESENTING SIX BEDS AND THERE A AN ASSOCIATION OF SMALL SIX BEDS ARE FEWER RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY AND DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED. THERE ABOUT TWO THOUSAND OF THEM AND I'M HERE TO INTRODUCE GEORGE COULD NEARING AND WHO IS. A FOUNDING BOARD MEMBER BUT ALSO SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF PUBLIC POLICY AND LEGISLATION FOR THE ASSOCIATION. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS LIKE TO START BY THANKING ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON. AS WELL OUR PRINCIPAL COOPER SENATOR WIENER FOR UNDERSTANDING IS THIS ISSUE IN CARRYING HIS BILL ON OUR BEHALF WE THANK YOU -- IS A SOMEONE MATTER MEMBER PATTERSON POINTED OUT CURRENT LAW REQUIRES A CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CLEARANCE FOR AN EMPLOYEE THE TRANSFER TO A NEW FACILITY BEFORE THE EMPLOYEE CAN WORK THERE EVEN IF THE NEW FACILITY IS OPERATED BY THE SAME LICENSEE. IPORTANT NOTE THAT APPROXIMATELY 80% OF CALIFORNIA'S RCF FEES ARE SIX BUT FACILITIES. AND MANY SIX BUT LICENSEES OPERATE MULTIPLE FACILITIES IN THE SAME GEOGRAPHIC LOCALE. IN A SUCH A LICENSE HE HAS AN EMPLOYEE WHO IS CLEARED AN ASSOCIATE TO TO AT LEAST ONE OF ITS FACILITIES BUT FOUND TO BE WORKING AT ANOTHER ONE OF THE SAME LICENSES LOCATIONS. WITHOUT BEING FORMALLY ASSOCIATED BY CCL TO THAT LOCATION CURRENT STATUTES RECESS SITUATION IDENTICALLY AS A SITUATION WHERE A LICENSEE ALLOWED A NEW EMPLOYEE TO WORK WITHOUT ANY CRIMINAL. BACKGROUND CLEARANCE RESULTING IN A CIVIL PENALTY OF ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER DAY UP TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. HOWEVER AS WE KNOW THESE TWO SITUATIONS CLEARLY ARE NOT IDENTICAL AB FOUR FOUR SEVEN WOULD STOP UNFAIRLY PENALIZING LICENSEES WHO MAY HAVE FORGOTTEN TO TRANSFER THE CLEARANCE OF AN ALREADY CLEARED EMPLOYEE. WORKING AT ONE OF ITS OTHER LOCATIONS OR FOR SITUATIONS WHERE THE LOCAL CCL OFFICE FAILED TO PROPERLY PROCESS A CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CLEARANCE TRANSFER REQUEST. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO KNOW THE WHILE SIX BUT FACILITIES HAVE HIGH STAFFING RATIOS BECAUSE THEY ARE SMALL IN NATURE EACH FACILITY NEVER THE LESS HAS A LOW EMPLOYEE COUNT ON AN ABSOLUTE BASIS. A SUCH AS IMPORTANT FOR LICENSEES TO BE ABLE TO EASILY MOVE STAFF BETWEEN ITS LOCATIONS OUR SPONSOR A VARIETY OF SITUATIONS SUCH AS WHEN EMPLOYEES CALL IN SICK GO ON FAMILY OR MEDICAL LEAVE OR ABRUPTLY QUIT THEIR EMPLOYMENT. THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW LICENSEES OF MULTIPLE FACILITIES THE FLEXIBILITY TO QUICKLY MOVE STAFF BETWEEN US LOCATIONS THEREBY MAINTAINING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF RESIDENTS OF BY ASSURING ADEQUATE STAFFING AT ALL TIMES WITHOUT RISKING BEING UNFAIRLY PENALIZED. EIGHTY FOUR FOUR SEVEN WILL MODERNIZE CURRENT STATUTE AND BETTER ALIGN IT WITH THE OPERATIONAL REALITIES RCF FEES PARTICULARLY SMALLER CF FEES BASED ON A REGULAR BASIS WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT A AB FOUR FOUR SEVEN WORLD WILL RESULT AND EFFICIENCIES. THAT WILL REDUCE THE SEALS WORKLOAD RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I. BUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE'RE GONNA TAKE A QUICK PAUSE TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM. SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. RICARDO.

PRESENT BEFORE YOU SIMPLY BILL FOR EIGHTY WHICH WOULD ESTABLISH AN OLDER ADULT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATOR. TO OVERSEE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR OLDER ADULTS. OUTCOME INDICATORS IN ST CARE AND STANDARDIZE -- GERIATRICS TRAINING FOR MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. AS WE KNOW ONE IN FIVE ADULTS EXPERIENCES MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS HOWEVER LESS THAN ONE THIRD OF ALL OLDER ADULTS THE UNITED STATES WHO NEED MENTAL HEALTH. CARE RECEIVING WITHOUT ALL DISCORDANT DEFER TO OUR WITNESS THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME BE HERE -- MY NAME IS JANET FRANK AND I'M ON FACULTY AT UCLA SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH. I AM PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY -- TO SURE SOME FINDINGS THAT WE HAVE FROM OUR MENTAL HEALTH A SERVICE ACT IN OLDER ADULTS STUDY. WE FOUND SIGNIFICANT UNMET NEED AND GEOGRAPHIC DISPARITIES ACROSS THE STATE IN THE SERVICE PROVISION TO OLDER ADULTS. WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. WE FOUND VERY FEW PROGRAMS AND OUTREACH EFFORTS THAT WERE SPECIFICALLY TAILORED. FOR THE COMPLEX CARE NEEDS FOR OLDER ADULTS AN OUTCOME MEASUREMENT DATA WERE QUITE LIMITED. HOWEVER WE ALSO IDENTIFIED PROMISING PROGRAMS OFFERED IN SOME COUNTIES TO ADDRESS THESE DEFICITS. WE ALSO NOTICED THAT THERE WAS A GAP IN LEADERSHIP AT THE STATE LEVEL FOR MENTAL HEALTH IN OLDER ADULTS SERVICES. BASED ON OUR FINDINGS WE MADE SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDING TO ESTABLISH A FULL TIME ADMINISTRATIVE LEADERSHIP POSITION AT THE STATE LEVEL. DEDICATED TO OLDER ADULT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. WITH THE PROPER AUTHORITY THIS LEADERSHIP POSITION COULD IMPROVE ACCESS AND SERVICES FOR OLDER ADULTS WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. COULD CONTRIBUTE. TO AND OVERSEE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF STATE POLICIES TO IMPROVE SERVICES. PROVIDE NEEDED OVERSIGHT ESTABLISH STANDARDIZE REPORTING ENHANCE OLDER ADULTS OUT REACH DOCUMENTATION OF AND MET NEEDS. SURE PROGRAMS THAT ARE WORKING ACROSS THE STATE RATHER THAN HAVING THEM IN POCKETS OF COUNTIES. PROMOTE STANDARDIZE GERIATRIC TRAINING AND IMPORTANTLY INCREASE SERVICE INTEGRATION EFFORTS ESPECIALLY BETWEEN MEDICAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AGING AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE SERVICES TO PROMOTE. COMPREHENSIVE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. OUR STUDY SHOWED THAT OLDER ADULTS HAD HIGH UNMET NEEDS AND STATE DATA FOR FY EIGHTEEN SHOW THAT JUST OVER TWENTY SIX THOUSAND OLDER ADULTS THAT SIXTY FIVE AND OVER WERE PROVIDED SERVICES. THIS REPRESENTED LESS THAN 4% OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE SERVED PROSELYTES ROUND. CALIFORNIA'S OLDER ADULT POPULATION IS AROUND SEVEN MILLION. AND MOST OLDER ADULT PREVALENCE STUDIES SHOW THAT ABOUT 20% OF ADULTS OF SUFFER FROM MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROBLEMS. BUT LET'S TAKE IN A MORE CONSERVATIVE NUMBER LET'S SAY THOUSAND AND YET TWENTY SIX THOUSAND WERE SERVED. SO RIGHT NOW NO ONE IN THE STATE HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE THE SYSTEM MORE RESPONSIVE. TO THE NEEDS OF OLDER CALIFORNIANS WITH MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS THANK YOU. HERE I DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. PLEASE COME UP STATION NAME AN ORGANIZATION. LAUREN RALPH I'M WITH THE CALIFORNIA SENIOR LEGISLATURE AND WE'RE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. HELLO I'M TITUS Và SAY -- MY REPRESENT THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE AND WE ARE IN SUPPORT THIS BILL. HELLO MY NAME IS MAURICE REGIS AND REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA HOUSE WITH ASSOCIATION AND WE ALSO SUPPORTED THIS BILL. CAROL SO FROM THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON AGING IN SUPPORT WE DO HOPE TO SEE THE BILL AMENDED. AT LEAST IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE HEARING TO MOVE THE POSITION BACK TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES BUT WE FULLY SUPPORT CREATION OF THIS DIRECTORS. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MICHAEL RATIGAN ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS FAQ CLARA COUNTY -- I ARRIVED HERE THINKING WE WERE IN SUPPORT -- I'M NOT SURE NOW WAS UNAWARE OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT LIMITED TO SIX SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES. AND IN LIGHT OF THAT WE WOULD. THE REQUESTED THE BILL BE AMENDED TO ADD ANOTHER COUNTY I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY I APOLOGIZE. DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. TO HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR MY COMMITTEE MEMBERS FROM THE NUMBER FELL -- THE FUNDING FOR THIS -- THE QUESTION WOULD BE THE MIL HEALTH SERVICES ARE -- I JUST WENT OVER THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE REPORT. AND I WAS SAYING. HOMELESS PROGRAM FUNDED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES -- GO ALL THESE OTHER PROGRAMS FUNDED AND ADDED UP TO OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS SO. THE QUESTION IS -- SPECIFICALLY YOU'RE POINTING OUT THAT THE TOOK WERE SOURCE OF FUNDS RIGHT. ARE YOU ARE YOU LOOKING AT THAT SOLELY OR YOU LOOK INTO. ANY ANY PLACE YOU CAN FIND THE FUNDS. DEBBIE THE QUESTION I MEAN YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU KNOW WITH ALL. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THE BUDGET YET BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T VOTED ON IT RIGHT BUT SEEMS TO ME IT LOOKS LIKE. THERE'S A LOT OF DRAW DOWN ON THAT AND THAT PHONE IN THIS THIS PARTICULAR BUDGET THAT'S ALL. AND HAVE THE HAVE THEY LOOKED AT IT HAVE THEY HAVE THEY LOOKED AT THIS BILL. TO VIOLATED THE YEAH TO SENATOR YET NOW THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THIS AREA -- TO BUT WHEREVER WE CAN GET THE FUNDING WILL WANT TO DO WITH. WAS HIGHLIGHT WITH THE LEGISLATION THE IMPORTANCE FOR THE SO WHY WE NEED TO DO THAT SO WHETHER IT'S THE THE FUNDING MECHANISM THAT YOU'VE OUTLINED WE'VE ALSO TALKED TO LEADERSHIP. AND THE BUDGET STAFF AND CONFERENCE -- COMMITTEE AS WELL AS IDENTIFYING YOU KNOW YEAH I DON'T CARE WHERE THE MONEY COMES FROM AS LONG AS HELPING THESE INDIVIDUALS. AND IF THAT'S A DIFFERENT POT OF MONEY THEN YOU KNOW I WAS I'M AMENABLE TO THAT JOB AND WOULD -- APPRECIATE THAT BUT MOVING FORWARD BECAUSE WE HAVE A VOTE ON THE BUDGET I KNOW IT'S PART OF THE DISCUSSION. I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT --% MANAGER BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW IF THE WE DON'T KNOW THE STATUS OF THAT ORDER. THAT'S JUST THE ONE KIND OF CAUTIONARY. NOTE ON THIS ISSUE GRABS. THEY COULD SAY THIS FUND EARNS ANY OTHER FUNDS THAT IRAQ MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE AND THAT SOMETHING YOU WERE LOOKING TO MAYBE GET SOME CLARITY ON AS WE MOVE TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE IF IT PASSES COMMITTEE. OKAY I'M I'M SUPPORTING THE BILL I JESSICA AT A QUESTION ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU AND APPRECIATE -- AMERICANS ALSO TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH WITH THE BILL I JUST THAT SOME. FOR QUESTIONS REGARDING HOW THIS OF OPERATE SO I THINK WHEN THE ISSUES IS -- IS BROUGHT UP AGAIN ABOUT FUNDING BE MORE FLEXIBLE Là. BUT ALSO -- AND WE TALK ABOUT ADMINISTRATOR BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE GIVEN THE LIST OF THINGS ARE SUPPOSED TO DO YOU REALLY LOOKING FOR A WHOLE OFFICE RIGHT I MEAN IT'S CAN'T ONE PERSON'S LACKEY MAIL DO ALL OF THIS IS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR SOMEWHERE. OKAY ALL RIGHT SIDE SO THEN THE I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION IS -- AS THE IS WHY THE APARTMENT AGING VERSES INDEED C. S. SINCE DTS NOT ONLY OF COURSE -- OVERSEAS ALL THE MEDI CAL MONEY BY THE WAY -- FOR MENTAL HEALTH -- ALSO HAS -- PERHAPS A CLOSER RELATIONSHIP WITH -- THE THE HEALTH SERVICES -- OVERSIGHT MISSION AND AND THAT THOSE FUNDS AS WELL SO WELL CERTAINLY DEPRIVE AGING DOES VERY POOR ROLE WITH SENIORS AND WORKS WITH. THE TRIPLE A.'S -- BUT GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE THE FOR THIS MINISTER SUPPOSED TO DO -- MAYBE YOU CAN ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ABOUT THAT AND ABSOLUTELY -- YEAH THIS IS A DISCUSSION THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING ON GOING INTO SOMETHING THAT WE HAD IN THE POLICY COMMITTEE AS WELL. OVER IN THE ASSEMBLY ABOUT WORD WE HOUSES TWO HOUSES THE DCH US OR TO THE PARTNER OF AGING. AND YOU KNOW THROUGH THOSE NEGOTIATIONS AS WHY WE HAVE THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE HAVE NOW BUT YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THE THOUGHT IS STILL BRING EVERYBODY TOGETHER AS IT. BEFORE IT ENDS UP BOMB IN ITS FINAL FORM ON THE SENATE FLOOR. OUT WERE THE BEST WAY IS TO DO THAT -- WHAT WE DIDN'T WANT TO HAPPEN WAS TO HOLD THE BILL AND PREVENT PROGRESS FROM HAPPENING ESPECIALLY AS WE'RE HAVING BUDGET NEGOTIATION TALKS? AND WE DON'T WANT THIS TO BE A HINDRANCE AS WELL AS WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO PUSH IT SO YOU KNOW. HAVE SOMETHING MOVING THE DISCUSSIONS GO A LOT FURTHER. THAN THAT SO WE APPRECIATE YOUR INPUT AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT AS WELL OKAY WELL I THINK I THINK IT -- ONE OF THINGS THAT. THE HELPFUL AS HAVING A BETTER IDEA OF EXACTLY HOW. THIS THE HOW THE INDUSTRY IN THE OFFICE WOULD WORK AND A RELATIONSHIP. OF OUR FOR TO BE EFFECTIVE RIGHT RIGHT AND EXACTLY YOU KNOW WHERE IT'S HOWLS -- THE ISRAELI ISSUE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT HOW HOW'S IT GONNA BE A PERFORMANCE FUNCTIONS AND THE RELATIONSHIPS -- THAT THE ADMINISTRATORS GOING TO NEED TO HAVE SO I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON ESTIMATES THAT THIS IS I DON'T OF THIS TO GO TO ANOTHER POLICY COMMITTEE FROM THIS. ONE BECAUSE THE HEALTH OH OKAY WELL OKAY THEN WHO HAS THE TIME TO FIGURE THAT OUT THEN OKAY. SO -- I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING THE ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS -- AS YOU WORK THAT OUT. ABSOLUTELY I APPRECIATE THAT SENATORS WE CONTINUE BEFORE OBVIOUSLY -- FIND OUT THAT THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE ALSO SERVES ON HEALTH SO. WE BOTH WANT TO KNOW. GREAT NO MORE THAN HAPPY TO SHARE -- THE DISCUSSION SORT OF BEEN INVOLVING AROUND THAT AS WELL. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALAS YOU'RE FREE TO CLOSE OKAY I JUST WANT. TO COMMEND DOCTOR FRANK AND ALL THE WORK THAT UCLA IS DONE ON THIS ISSUE -- OBVIOUSLY THIS ISSUE THAT CONTINUES TO GROW IN TERMS OF THE NEED FOR THE AWARENESS BUT ALSO. TRYING TO TACKLE THE ISSUES -- WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS FOR INSTANCE EVEN THE SUICIDE RATES FOR OLDER AMERICANS AND HOW THAT'S BEEN INCREASING YEAR AFTER YEAR -- SHOWS WHY WE NEED -- SPECIFIC FOCUS ON THIS ON THIS ISSUE AREAS RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I'VE. WELL OKAY GREAT. FOR THE MOTION FIVE SENATOR PAN TO DO PASSED TO SENATE HEALTH SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. A TITLE. I'VE FOR TITLE IX STONE BELL. BELL I JACKSON PAN. PAN AYE WIENER [inaudible] THREE THANK YOU SO WE WILL GO AHEAD AND OF LEAVE THIS OPEN. WOULD YOU LIKE TO PRESENT ON A. B. NINE SEVEN ZERO PLEASE OKAY. GO FEEL FREE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS AND ASSEMBLY BILL NINE SEVENTY WOULD HELP PROVIDE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION FOR SENIORS AND THE DISABLED HEALTH CARE APPOINTMENTS. SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL WOULD ESTABLISH A GRANT PROGRAM WHICH WOULD PROVIDE FOR THE PURCHASE OF OR LEASE OF ZERO EMISSION EARNERS OUR ISSION VEHICLES PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION TO AND FROM NON EMERGENCY MEDICAL. HEALTH CARE APPOINTMENTS FOR OLDER INDIVIDUALS AND PERSONS LIVING WTH A DISABILITY. ELDERLY INDIVIDUALS AND INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES OFTEN HAVE GREATER HEALTH CARE NEEDS AND TRANSPORTATION CAN BE PRESENT. TAKEN PRESENTE SIGNIFICANT -- BARRIER TO CARE -- WITH THAT IDEA OF TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. MY NAME IS LAUREN RALPH AND I'M A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA SENIOR LEGISLATURE. I ALSO WAS -- A CO AUTHOR OF THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL AND THE CALIFORNIA SENIOR LEGISLATURE FOR THIS BILL. AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S IT'S A BILL THAT SORT OF RECTIFY IS A DISPARITY AMONG. SENIORS LIVING IN RURAL AREAS VERSUS SENIORS LIVING IN MORE POPULATED AREAS OF THE STATE. AS THE THE ABSTRACT MENTIONS -- MEDI CAL AND PAYMENT FOR TRANSPORTATION TO AND FROM MEDICAL SERVICES IS AVAILABLE THROUGH CAMP TAXI. PRIVATE TRANSPORTATION BUSES. TRAINS. BUT IN THE RURAL POPULATION THOSE OF THOSE COMMON FORMS OF TRANSPORTATION OR NOT AVAILABLE AND IF YOU'RE CONSTANTLY. RELYING UPON AND A FRIEND OR A RELATIVE. VERY OFTEN. YOU CAN IN THE MISTER TRANSPORTATION AND THEREFORE MISTER MEDICAL TRANSPORTATION. AND THEY GET THE ABILITY TO GET TRANSPORTATION TO MEDI CAL APPOINTMENTS. MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS PROVIDING THE MEDICAL SERVICES THEMSELVES. I AND IT COULD BE CRITICAL IN. RURAL AREAS MANY COUNTIES HAVE LIMITED OR NO TRANSIT SERVICES AVAILABLE TO NON EMERGENCY MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS CHRONIC HEALTH PROBLEMS REQUIRE ACCESS. TO RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION TO MEDICAL. COMPLEXES OFTEN SEVERAL MILES AWAY SOMETIMES MANY MILES AWAY. MAKING A SEVEN TO FIFTEEN PASSENGER VANS AVAILABLE TO SHUTTLE SEVERAL SENIORS AT A TIME TO THEIR TREATMENT. ADDRESSES THIS PROBLEM. AS IT IS TODAY. SENIORS IN MANY COUNTY SUCH AS SAN BERNADINO LAKE COUNTY SAID NO MY COUNTY MANY. COUNTIES THAT HAVE A LOT OF RURAL AREAS. HAVE TO RECRUIT VOLUNTEER DRIVERS AND AS WE MENTIONED -- OFF A WE DIDN'T MENTION THAT OFTEN THE VOLUNTEER DRIVERS ARE USING. THE HIGHER POLLUTION OLDER VEHICLES WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO THAT OF THE F. ZERO THE ADMISSION OF CAN'T THINK OF ANY. IN ANY CASE -- SO THESE TRANSPORTATION GRANTS TO COUNTIES OR DEPARTMENTS OF AGING. COUNTY OFFICES WOULD REMOVE THE BARRIER TO OBTAINING MEDICAL TREATMENTS AND IT HERE ALSO TO THE STATE'S. PRIORITY TO REDUCE POLLUTION. PROVIDING THIS NON EMERGENCY MEDICAL TRANSFER THE PROTECTION TO THE SENIORS WILL INCREASE. THE PROBABILITY THAT THEY REMAIN HEALTHY AND OUT OF HOSPITALS OR SNAPS. WE ASK YOUR VOTE TO MAKE THIS THING HAPPEN. THANK YOU I DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE SPELL. NO CA NINETY WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES OPPOSED TO THE SPELL. PLEASE COME UP. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS KATHERINE GARCIA AND I'M A POLICY ADVOCATE FOR SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA. THE CALIFORNIA HAS TAKEN AND OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION -- WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT SPECIFIC LANGUAGE IN THE BILL. OUR CONCERN IS SPECIFIC. TO THE USE OF THE TERM NEAR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE. AND THE BILL THE BILL STATES THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING WOULD RECEIVE DO YOU CHAIR OF FUNDS. FOR BOTH THEIR EMISSION VEHICLES AND YEARS ZERO WE ASK THAT YOU REMOVE NEAR -- ZERO THE REASON IS GIGI RF IS INTENDED TO HELP CALIFORNIA TRANSITION TO A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE WE HAVE LIMITED TIME AND RESOURCES TO TACKLE THE CLIMATE CRISIS. THROUGH INCLUDING NEAR ZERO VEHICLES IN THIS PROGRAM WITH UNDERMINED IF. AFFECTED NESS OF GIGI RF IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THERE ARE CURRENTLY ZERO MISSION SHUTTLE SOLD IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE ADA COMPLIANT. WHEN IT COMES TO CLEAN TRANSPORTATION? ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE PROVIDE THE MOST EFFECTIVE PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT WISH TO SPEAK THEIR OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL NOW. DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM. COMMITTEE MEMBERS CENTER A BELT WITH. LISTEN THE ASSEMBLY -- BUILDING. GET REVIEWED BY THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE. THIS. BUT IT DID BUT IT DIDN'T GET REVIEWED HERE -- WE HAVE A GOD THAT THIS IS OUR FIRST POLICY COMMITTEE ON THE SENATE SIDE. OKAY -- SEE MY QUESTION WOULD BE THE THAT'S AVERY THE ISSUE ABOUT ZERO ZERO ON ZERO THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT. THAT'S A BIG ISSUE BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF LEGISLATION. IS BEING DEBATED RIGHT NOW ON THAT INTERCOURSE SUBJECT AND IF I MAY SEND YOU TOUCHED ON OUT IN YOUR BILL IS KIND OF WONDERING WHY YOU TOUCHING THAT ISSUE YEAH. BECAUSE LIKE A SO THE REASON WHY WE ADDED AT NEAR ZERO EMISSION IS BECAUSE I INFRASTRUCTURE DOESN'T EXIST AROUND THE STATE. TO HAVE ALL ELECTRIC SO WE DIDN'T WANT TO EXCLUDE THOSE SENIORS AND RULE AREAS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA -- PLACES THAT LACK THAT INFRASTRUCTURE WOULDN'T WANT TO LEAVE THE SENIORS ON SIDE OF THE ROAD. NOT BEING ABLE TO GET TO THEIR MEDICAL PPOINTMENTS. SO THAT'S WHY WE ADDED THAT I MEAN IF THERE'S ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES YOU KNOW I GET THE GOAL OF NUTS WERE MOVING BUT WE DIDN'T WANT TO EXCLUDE THE SENIORS -- IN THOSE AREAS THAT LACK THE INFRASTRUCTURE. OR FOR SUCH A PROGRAM. THERE'S ANOTHER WAY GO AROUND -- NOTES THAT -- YOU DON'T JUST DO A STATEWIDE BLANKET. COVERAGE OF THAT YOU CAN. YOU CAN SAY THAT IF THERE IS NO ELECTRIC VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE OPTION [inaudible] THAT. THE OTHER WOULD BE CONSIDERED BUT THAT'S KIND OF A POLICY DISCUSSION YOU KNOW SO. YEAH -- WEARING WHY THAT THAT WAS DISCUSSED -- OKAY YES THAT'S WHY WILL I'M GONNA LOOK AT THIS AND MY **** IS GO TO MY COMMITTEE. YES YOUR ARMS YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT ISSUE. OF THE CLEAN AIR ISSUE HERE NOW SO WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE INCLUDED BOTH VERSIONS TO NOT -- EXCLUDE ANYONE -- HELLO -- OKAY THIS ZERO INNER SELF. OKAY. THANK YOU [inaudible] SENATE. THANK YOU -- SO CERTAINLY SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S A TRANSPORTATION ISSUES TO WORK OUT OF MY QUESTIONS ACTUALLY HAVE TO PRETEND SO THE THE GRANTS WOULD GO TO THE AGING AGENCIES TO OPERATE THIS VEHICLES. OR COUNTIES YOU SAID I I WAS WONDERING FOR EXAMPLE -- WOULD PUBLIC TRANSIT AGENCIES -- TO MAY PROVIDE YOU KNOW THE OPERATE BUT COULD PROVIDE DIRECT TRANSAT AND ZAID SO I'M SURE IT'S US. SO THEM THE UNIVERSE OF PEOPLE WHO COULD RECEIVE THE GRANTS IS SUCH THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE THE AIMS OF YOUR BILL WHICH IS. PROVIDE SO DIFFERENT LOCALITIES MAY HAVE DIFFERENT. YOU KNOW WHETHER ORGANIZATIONS ARE ARE SO FORTH SO -- IF YOUR AREA AGENTS EIGHT AGING AGENCY DOESN'T IS USED ARE OPERATING IN TRANSIT TRANSPORTATION THAT IS THE SERVICE RIGHT -- BILL WOULD DAY. BUT WITH THE GRANT BE ABLE TO GO TO ARE THEY WOULD HAVETO SUBCONTRACT THE GRANT WHICH THEN CREATES MORE ADMINISTRATIVE RED SIDE SO I JUST WANT TO RAISE THAT ISSUE IN TERMS OF TO WHOM THE GRANT TO BE ABLE TO GO TO ACHIEVE THE AIMS OF THE BILL. I I APPRECIATE THAT -- QUESTIONS CENTER ON SOMETHING THAT WE WERE THINKING ABOUT AS WELL GIVEN -- THE DIVERSITY OF OUR STATE IN WHICH ELECTIONS IS ACTUALLY DO THAT SO WE INCLUDED LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT IT'LL. GO TO LOCAL REGIONAL TRENDS -- TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES AREA AGENCIES ON AGING. I COUNTY'S PUBLIC TRANSIT OPERATORS -- AND THAT'S ALL OUTLINED ON PAGE THREE IF THAT HELPS OKAY ALL RIGHT I THAT WAS ENTERED COUNTY AND I HEARD A OR AGENCY IDEAS AND HEARING THE TRANSIT AGENCIES AND SOME SOME OF THE MARK YOU KNOW.

ARE MORE THAN HAD PUTTING IN SOME LANGUAGE PERHAPS THAT SAYS THAT IF YOU KNOW WE REALLY DO WANT ZERO UNLESS THERE AND PERHAPS THAT WILL GET SORTED OUT LATER ON BYE BYE. YEAH PROP SO I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION AND TALK TO CENTER THE BILL OR WHOEVER. YOU KNOW MY WHOLE THING WAS JUST NOT LEAVING SENIORS ON SUNDAY SO I GUESS THEIR COMMITMENT TO ZERO IF ESPECIALLY IF IT'S AVAILABLE IN THE REGION THAT THAT THAT SHOULD BE ZERO AYE AYE A GUY I GOT THE AND THERE ARE. SOME NUANCES TO WORK OUT THERE. THEN I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO BUT IN THE AT LEAST IN AREAS WHERE THERE IS AVAILABILITY INFRASTRUCTURE. THAN THAT WILL BE A REQUIREMENT THAT IT'S ZERO MORE THAN HAPPY TO LOOK AT LANGUAGE THAT ADDRESSESOUT OF MOVING FORWARD OBVIOUSLY IF THERE'S BEST AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY OUT IMAGINE THE LOCAL.

AND THE COALITION OF CALIFORNIA WELFARE RIGHTS ORGANIZATION ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. ALAMEDA COUNTY IS HERE FOR ALL THE REASONS THAT WERE STATED BY JESSICA BARTH HELLO. I'M HERE TO FOCUS ON THE DATA AND A STATEMENT FROM AN ALAMEDA COUNTY CLIENT. AS OF MARCH TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN IN ALAMEDA COUNTY WE ASSISTED THIRTY EIGHT INDIVIDUALS TO RECEIVE THIS BENEFIT.

TWENTY EIGHT RIVERSIDE TWENTY AND SAN MATTEO. TWELVE WHILE SMALL IN NUMBER IT WOULD HELP OUR COMMUNITY TREMENDOUSLY. I WILL NOW READ INTO THE RECORD TESTIMONY FROM AN ALAMEDA COUNTY CLIENT WHO WAS HESITANT TO COME FORWARD OUT OF FEAR OF THE GOVERNMENT BUT WANTED TO SHARE HIS STORY. ON NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN I CAME WITH MY WIFE AND YOUNG SON TO THE UNITED STATES FROM AFGHANISTAN ON AN IMMIGRANT VISA UNDER THE SPONSORSHIP OF MY SISTER. MY WIFE HAD A VERY DIFFICULT TIME ADJUSTING TO LIFE IN THE UNITED STATES AND AS A RESULT SHE BECAME SEVERELY ILL. IN MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN pMY SISTER WAS STRAINED SHE NO LONGER WANTED TO BE INVOLVED WITH US. AND SHE REFUSED TO PROVIDE ANY MONETARY SUPPORT. LACKING RESOURCES IN JANUARY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE APPLIED FOR CAO WORKS AND WE'RE APPROVED UNDER THE SPONSOREDNON CITIZEN INDIGENT EXCEPTION. HOWEVER ON DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AFTER BEING ON AID FOR TWELVE MONTHS WE LOST ELIGIBILITY DUE TO THE TWELVE MONTH LIFETIME WRONG. I'VE BEEN STRUGGLING TO MAINTAIN A JOB DUE TO MY WIFE'S ILLNESS AND INSTABILITY. WE ARE NOW IN DANGER OF LOSING OUR LOW INCOME HOUSING BECAUSE WE CANNOT PAY THE RENT WITHOUT THE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT.

FOR SIXTY FIVE AND THIS BILL WILL CODIFY UNIVERSAL DEFINITIONS IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY OR TO IDENTIFY YOUTH IN BOTH TRIAL WELFARE SYSTEMS IN JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEMS -- I DID A BILL A COUPLE YEARS AGO TO SEE HOW HOW ARE WE DEALING WITH -- DUAL STATUS YOUTH USED TO FIND THEMSELVES BOTH IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM AS WELL AS AS CHAU WELFARE SYSTEM. AND SO WE FOUND OUT WE DON'T DO A GREAT JOB TRACKING THOSE YOU THEM WHAT HAPPENS TO MORE THAN WHERE THEY GO SO WE ASK FOR AN AUDIT. THAT ALREADY CAME BACK WITH A LOT OF RECOMMENDATIONS BUT ONE OF THE ONES THAT WE THOUGHT WE COULD JUST START WITH WHICH TO DEVELOP SOME UNIVERSAL DEFINITIONS OF THE WORDS THAT WE USE WHEN WE REFER TO YOUTH. SO IT'S SIMPLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS CODIFY UNIVERSAL DEFINITIONS OF HOW WE REFER TO USE AND USE OF LANGUAGE AROUND YOUTHS IN THAT ARE STILL STATUS AND BOTH.

TEENAGERS AND NOW THIS WHEN DEALING WITH SENIORS -- SO A COUPLE YEARS AFTER SOME OF THE OUTRAGEOUS THINGS WE SAW IN THE BAY AREA -- ABOUT WITH RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL FACILITIES OF PEOPLE LEAVING CHARGES AND NOT BEING LICENSE CLOSING ONE FACILITY IN AN OPENING ANOTHER -- ONE A LOT OF LIKE HIDE THE BALL IT FELT LIKE SOME OF THE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID TO TRY TO CLEAN THAT UP WAS TO SAY. WE HAD AB POSTED ON THE AGENCY'S WEBSITE WHAT ANY COMPLAINTS WERE READ OWN SOMETHING BEFORE AND THEN IF YOU DON'T WE'RE GONNA TRANSFERRED TO SOMETHING ELSE WE MADE ALL THAT INFORMATION A LOT EASIER FOR FAMILIES TO USE. YOUR FAMILY AT HOME TRYING TO FIND A PLACE YOU'RE GONNA PUT YOUR LOVED ONE ALRIGHT ALREADY HAD REALLY DIFFICULT DECISION BUT THEN HOW DO YOU FIND OUT IF IT'S A GOOD FACILITY OR THEY'VE HAD ISSUES BEFORE. SO WE CLEAN THAT UP THAT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND THIS YEAR WE'RE COMING BACK -- JUST BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE COULD GET TRICKY WITH THE LLC'S -- AND MAKING A CORPORATION SAID THEIR NAME IS NOT THERE SO THIS JUST ALLOWS -- THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO BE ABLE. TO LOOK MORE CLOSELY AT THE ARRANGEMENT. OF THE OWNERSHIP OF THESE FACILITIES.

AND AND THAT'S BEEN VERY GOOD WE WE THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES IS NOW GETTING. A LIST OF OWNERSHIP RELATED TO EACH FACILITY. WHO HAVE UP 210% OWNERSHIP INTEREST? UNFORTUNATELY WHAT WE'VE LEARNED OF LAST SEVERAL YEARS IS THAT A LOT OF TIMES THESE LISTS. COMPRISE ARE COMPRISED ENTIRELY OF ENTITIES AND WE DON'T KNOW WHO THE INDIVIDUALS ARE BEHIND THESE ENTITIES SO WE'VE BEEN REALLY BLOCKED FROM THIS VERY CORE FUNCTION OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT WHICH IS. MAKING SURE THAT THESE PROVIDERS ARE GOING TO BE FIT AND COMPETENT TO DO THIS JOB. AND THEY'VE REALLY BEEN ABLE TO NOT ONLY LIMIT THEIR LIABILITY THROUGH THIS LOC ARRANGEMENT BUT TO LIMIT THEIR IDENTITY. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIX IN THIS BILL IS TO GIVE THE DEPARTMENT THE ABILITY TO TO OBTAIN MORE INFORMATION RELATED TO THE OWNERSHIP OF THESE FACILITIES. AND PEEL THE PAN THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO THE LICENSE SO THAT THEY CAN BE MORE SURE THAT THE CARE THERE'S GOING TO BE GOOD FOR OUR SENIORS AND DEPENDENT ADULTS. SO. WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU.

WOULD REQUESTED A MAN MAD AT A PLACE ONE COUNTY FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES AS OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. NOW DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS CENTER PAN. SO I I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AS TO AND YOUR I THINK ALL OF US REPRESENT NORTHERN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES THAT STRUGGLES HOMELESSNESS AS WELL. WHAT WAS THE RATIONALE FOR LIMITING THE COUNTIES JUST TO THE? SIX THEIR HERE WHICH I MEAN WAS I I DON'T SEE THE CONTENDERS IN WHAT THE CONCERN WAS AT FIRST I WANT THANK YOU FOR YOUR BILL IT'S AND I THINK THE IDEA OF DOING PREVENTION AND GETTING AHEAD OF THE CURVE. SAID WAIT TILL SO FALLS OFF THE CLIFF IS REALLY IMPORTANT ONE NOW I GUESS THE QUESTION IS WHY CAN'T WE AVAIL OURSELVES OF THIS AS WELL. LOONEY CERVANTES OF THE THE PREVIOUS COMMITTEE SUGGESTED THAT WE NARROWED DOWN TO SEE IF IF IT'LL WORK IN THERE WAS SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT AROUND THE ISSUE OF PRIVACY -- ORIGINALLY WE STARTED WITH THE ENTIRE STATE BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THIS IS A STATE WIDE PROBLEM -- IF IT'S UP TO ME -- I'D RATHER MAKE IT STATE WIDE -- BUT WE HAD TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATIONS. DO DO DO EAT EGGS YOU COULD YOU ELABORATE PERHAPS THEY KNOW THAT YOU'RE NOT COMMITTEE YOU WERE YOU HAD ACCEPT THESE AMENDMENTS THAT WATER CHOICE BUT AT ONCE A PRIVACY ISSUES I MEAN WAS THERE SOMETHING ABOUT NORTHERN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES ARE CENTRAL VALLEY COUNTIES THAT. WE WERE AT THAT THE COURT WE WERE PRETTY GOOD HAILING PRIVACY. MAY I RESPOND. YEAH THE ISSUE WHAT THE ISSUE WAS AND THAT OTHER COUNTIES COULDN'T ON DEPRIVED CITY SHE WAS ENSURING THAT WE WOULD DO -- PRIVACY CORRECTLY AND THAT IT WOULDN'T BE. BUT THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY ISSUES WITH THAT I I I THINK THAT WAS EXACTLY WAS TOLD US. A BOOK I'D BE HAPPY CHANGE I CAN'T CHANGE SHOULD BE -- BECAUSE THE PREVIOUS COMMITTEE HAD SUGGESTED THAT IDEA BUT I'D BE OPEN AND WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU TO GET IT CHANGED ABSOLUTELY I'D HAVE TO HAVE THE MIND OF THE PREVIOUS CAMINO. SURE OKAY -- I UNDERSTAND YOUR DILEMMA -- I HOPE PERHAPS WE CAN RAISE THE QUESTION THAT WE WOULD GIVE ACTUALLY COUNTIES THE OPTION. THAT YOU KNOW -- STUDENTS TO TO TO DO THIS IF THEY WISHED I THINK THAT WOULD BE YEAH COUNTY DOESN'T THAT'S FINE -- BUT I HOPE THAT WE CAN. MAYBE MOVE TO A PLACE WHERE. COUNTIES COULD IF THEY CHOSE TO DO SO SELECT TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS ADD MORE IN LINE WITH YOUR ORIGINAL BILL AND CERTAINLY -- THE BIKE THINK ABOUT HOW WE COULD WORK WITH YOU AND THE ASSEMBLY PRIZE COMMITTEE -- TO TO BE SURE THAT IF THERE WERE SPECIFIC PRIVACY CONCERNS THEY HAD ABOUT OTHER COUNTIES COMING ABOARD THAT WE GET THIS ADDRESSED BUT TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE. COUNTIES IF THEY CHOOSE TO DO SO. WOULD BE ABLE -- TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF OF OF OF YOUR BILL IN. MADAM CHAIR MY RESPOND. YEAH SIR. YEAH WE DID A PREVIOUS BILL WHERE THAT ONE WAS STATE WIDE IF IF MY MEMORY SERVES IN LOAN THAT WAS AB TWO TEN AND THAT SEEMS TO BE GO IT WILL BE GOING IN IMPLEMENTATION. BUT BUT AT THE SAME TIME I WOULD ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH YOU THAT THAT IS THAT I WOULD THINK IT'S A STATEWIDE -- CONCERN AND THE REASON IT WAS NEAR THOSE PARTICULAR COUNTIES IS BECAUSE WE WERE ABLE TO SUSTAIN MORE THAN JUST LA COUNTY BY SAYING THAT IT'S A REGIONAL. ISSUE OTHERWISE I THINK YOU MAY BE BEEN BEEN TAPERED A LITTLE BIT -- MORE NARROW -- BUT CERTAINLY I THINK THERE'S A SPIRIT OF ON SHARING INFORMATION THAT WOULD EXTEND FROM THE FIRST BILL THAT WE DID -- WHICH ALLOWED THE SHARING OF INFORMATION -- ONE SOMEBODY WAS HOMELESS AND LET ME. WALK YOU THROUGH JUST TO REFRESH YOUR MEMORY BUT IF SOMEBODY -- WAS HOMELESS IN THE VISITED -- LET'S A PROBATION OFFICER OR OR OR SOMEBODY IN CAL WORKS ETCETERA THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL CAN THEN SHARE THE INFORMATION -- OF THE RECIPIENT OF SERVICES WITH ANOTHER COUNTY OR NONPROFIT AGENCY OR CITY TO TRY TO GET THAT PERSON AND THE USER -- SUPPORT SERVICES IT BASICALLY THING CONCEPT I I WOULD I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU BUT AND I WOULD -- I WOULD HELP THOSE ARGUMENTS TO INCLUDE OTHER COUNTIES. IT GOES OFF THANK YOU AGAIN I RECOGNIZE IT'S A VALID THANK YOU FOR THE BILL AND I RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS NOT EXACT AND SITUACIóN YOUR OWN CHOOSING I'VE. WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON HERE I THOUGHT. WELL I'M I'M CONFUSED NOW BECAUSE I DON'T SEE WHERE ON THE BILL IT. IS LIMITED. RAPPER. AND I DIDN'T SEE AN ANALYSIS THAT DOESN'T SAID THE PRIVACY COMMITTEE HEARD THE BILL. IT SAYS ONLY EARNED SERVICES. I THANK I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PROCESS OF MATHEMATICAL. YEAH IT'S IT'S IT'S MINOR SO YOU CAN -- YOU CAN -- PRACTICE OF AMONG OTHER WAS A TECHNICAL AIR WHIRLS NOT LIMITED AND SO THOSE AMENDMENTS HAD TO BE TAKEN AND THIS COMMITTEE -- BUT THAT IT WAS RECOMMENDED TO ME IN AND THE PREVIOUS CONTRACT. THAT'S CORRECT THERE WAS A FOR IT WAS DOUBLE REFERRED IN THE ASSEMBLY IT WAS HUMAN SERVICES PROSSER OKAY I THINK THERE'S A TECHNICAL ERROR WITH THAT THAT'S WHAT WORKS UP IN THE THE CAN I THINK WHAT'S UP IN THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS COMMITTEE. THAT WERE THAT WERE -- FOR ASKED OF ME TO ACCEPT IN THE PREVIOUS COMMITTEE. FOR THE PRIVACY COMMITTEE. HAD AMENDMENTS THAT WERE NEVER TAKEN ANY ASSEMBLY ACCEPTED THEM -- THEM AS A MINUTE TECHNICAL AREA WHERE THEY WEREN'T WRITTEN IN AND SO I HAVE TO CONTINUE TO ACCEPT THEM HERE OF COURSE THE WERE REQUIRED. YOU OFFER THE YOU CAN REJECT. I KNOW I MEAN I HAVE I HAVE. TO ACCEPT THEM. JUST FOR CLARIFICATION. AND SPEAKING WITH OUR COMMITTEE STAFF THEY'RE LETTING ME KNOW THAT THEY DID GO THROUGH -- PRIVACY RIGHT THE BUDGET COMMITTEE FOR FOR SOME REASON BUT IT DOESN'T SHOW UP IN THE ANALYSIS PART OF THE TECHNICAL VOTED.

THAT ARE NO LONGER IN EFFECT IN PARTICULAR -- THE THE MEASURE REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING TO PROVIDE AREA AGENCIES ON AGING WITH THE FLEXIBILITY TO DEVELOP AND MANAGE. PROGRAMS BASED ON LOCAL NEEDS THIS WOULD HAPPEN THROUGH BLOCK GRANTING OF FUNDS FOR VARIOUS PROGRAMS SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY THE LEGISLATURE HAS AMENDED THE OLDER CALIFORNIANS ACT. SEVERAL TIMES TO REFLECT THE CHANGING POPULATION AND EMERGING SERVICE DELIVERY NEEDS DESPITE THESE AMENDMENTS THE OLDER CALIFORNIANS ACT STILL CONTAINS SEVERAL OUTDATED SECTIONS.

GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR OF MY NAME IS LISA BUT I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN ASSOCIATION A MEMBERSHIP ASSOCIATION MADE UP OF THE LOCAL LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM STAFF VOLUNTEERS AND PROGRAM SUPPORTERS. WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO BE HERE IN SUPPORT OF ELEVEN OF THIRTY SEVEN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF AGING IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE OLDER AMERICANSACT PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA ONE OF THOSE IS THE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM. AND WHILE THERE ARE MANY THINGS TO BE SUPPORTIVE ABOUT AB ELEVEN THIRTY SEVEN I'M GONNA USE MY AND ONE MINUTE. TO FOCUS ON THE COST CONTAINMENT ASPECT OF THE BILL. THE CURRENT W. AN AYE CODE I'D NINETY ONE HUNDRED STIPULATES THAT CDA SHALL CONSIDER AVAILABLE DATA POPULATION TRENDS IN DEVELOPING PROGRAMS AND POLICIES. AND YET THE DEPARTMENT IS RESTRICTED IN DEVELOPING AND SUPPORTING INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS FOR OLDER ADULTS IF TO DO SO EXCEEDS THE CURRENT FUNDING ALLOCATIONS FOR THESE PROGRAMS. EVERY FOUR YEARS THE DEPARTMENT SPENDS MUCH TIME AND RESOURCES IN THE CRAFTING OF CD A STATE PLAN ON AGING. THIS REPORT SPECIFIES CTA'S GOALS AND OBJECTIVES FOR PLANNING. FOR THE PLANNING PERIOD IS DEFINED. WITH ARTICULATED ACTIVITIES FOR THE STATE OLDER CALIFORNIA PROGRAMS. THE CURRENT PROGRAM FROM TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY TWO INCLUDES DATA. PAGES AND PAGES OF DATA HIGHLIGHTING OF POPULATION TRENDS FOR CASTING CURRENT AND GROWING NEEDS FOR SERVICES. AND YET THIS VERY IMPORTANT REPORT IS DIMINISHED IN VALUE BECAUSE THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE RESTRICTED TO PROGRAM GOALS OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES THAT CAN BE CHEAP ACHIEVED WITHIN CTA'S EXISTING MEANS. THE CALIFORNIA LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN ASSOCIATION IS PLEASED TO SUPPORT AND WE THANK MEMBER AND ASSYRIAN FOR AUTHORING THIS I NEEDED LEGISLATION.

I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE THANK YOU. OKAY SO WE HAVE A MOTION TO MOVE THE BILL TO PASS TO AND THE MOTION IS TO DO PASSED THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS. US SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. RICARDO I RICARDO EYES STONE DEL. VALLE I JACKSON PAN. PAN AYE WIENER. WIENER I WAS. ZERO THE VOTE WAS FOUR ZERO WILL GO AHEAD AND LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN. MANY OF THE JEWS. ALL. RIGHT. AND WE ALSO HAVE -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER NAZARIAN HERE TO PRESENT AB ONE TWO THREE FIVE ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER TIãU. PLEASE FEEL FREE TO BEGIN WHEN YOU ARE READY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR A WAS GIVEN THE WONDERFUL TASK OF A PRESENTING THIS AB TWELVE THIRTY FIVE ON BEHALF OF MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM SAN JOSE KANSEN CHU WHO COULDN'T BE HERE UNFORTUNATELY -- A. B. TWELVE THIRTY FIVE BASICALLY MAKES THREE CHANGES TO THE WELFARE AND INSTITUTIONS CODE FIRST. IT CHANGES THE NAME RUN AWAY AND HOMELESS YOUTH SHELTERS TO YOUTH HOMELESS HOMELESSNESS PREVENTION CENTERS. THE NAME CHANGE MADE AT THE REQUEST OF THE SHELTERS WOULD MORE ACCURATELY REFLECT. THE WORK THE TWO AND A POPULATION THAT THEY SERVE. THE SECOND CHANGE EXPANDS THE CATEGORIES OF YOUTH WHO CAN BE HELPED BY YOUTH HOMELESSNESS PREVENTION CENTERS. FINALLY A. B. TWELVE THIRTY FIVE INCREASES THE AMOUNT OF TIME A YOUTH CAN STAY. AT ONE OF THESE FACILITIES FROM TWENTY ONE TEN NINETY NINE IN ORDER TO HAVE THEIR NEEDS MET. THIS IS CRITICAL BECAUSE APPROXIMATELY 25% OF YOUTH WHO RECEIVED TEMPORARY SHELTER NEED MORE THAN TWENTY ONE NIGHTS TO RESOLVE THEIR CASES. THE CURRENT TWENTY ONE NIGHT RULE IS BECAUSE FEDERAL FUNDING CAN BE USED TO SHELTER YOUTH. FOR A MAXIMUM OF TWENTY ONE NIGHTS AB TWELVE THIRTY FIVE ALLOWS OTHER FUNDING SOURCES TO BE USED FOR LONGER STAYS. NOW IF THE YOUTH NEEDS SHELTER BEYOND TWENTY ONE NIGHTS THE CENTERS THIS CHARGE AND THEN WE HAD MET. THEM FOR ADDITIONAL TWENTY ONE NIGHT PERIODS AT A TIME. OF WITH ME TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OUR AMANDA CLIFFORD OF THE BILL WAS THE WILSON CENTER AND WEST SEAVER OF JOHN BURTON ADVOCATES FOR YOUTH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS WESLEY SAY FROM A POLICY ADVOCATE WITH JOHN BURTON ADVOCATES FOR YOUTH I'M HERE TO SPEAK TODAY AS A CO SPONSOR OF A. B.. TWELVE THIRTY FIVE AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER NAZARIAN SHARED THE THREE PROVISIONS OF AB TWELVE THIRTY FIVE WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE OPERATION OF RUNAWAY AND HOMELESS YOUTH SHELTERS. IN CALIFORNIA. CURRENTLY THERE ARE ELEVEN RUNAWAY AND HOMELESS YOUTH SHELTERS IN CALIFORNIA IN ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT THIS VITAL NETWORK CONSERVE UP TO A COMBINED ONE HUNDRED FORTY SIX YOU. THE SHELTERS OFFER A COMPREHENSIVE SUITE OF SERVICES INCLUDING HOUSING CASE MANAGEMENT -- COUNSELLING REFERRALS TO COMMUNITY SERVICES LIFE SKILLS AND ACADEMIC SUPPORT. BY RECLASSIFYING THE SHELTERS AND EXPANDING THE CATEGORIES OF YOU THROUGH THEY MAY SERVE AB TWELVE THIRTY FIVE EFFECTIVELY REMOVES BARRIERS THAT OCCURRED DURING THE INTAKE PROCESS. ENABLING PROVIDERS TO MORE COMPREHENSIVELY EXPEDITIOUSLY DELIVER CARE TO THE YOUTH TO ARRIVE AT THEIR DOORSTEP. AB TWELVE THIRTY FIVE ALSO OFFERS THESE YOUTH THE PROVIDERS MORE TIME. UNDER CURRENT STATUTE YOUTH ME ONLY STATE RUN AWAY HOMELESS YOU SHELTERS FOR TWENTY ONE CONSECUTIVE NIGHTS AND FOR THE MORE COMPLEX CASES THIS IS AN INSUFFICIENT SERVICE WINDOW. FOR THESE YOUTH THE EXTENDED PROGRAMMATIC TIME OF NINETY CONSECUTIVE DAYS MADE POSSIBLE BY A. B. TWELVE THIRTY FIVE IS CRITICAL. ALLOWS FOR STABILITY AND INTERVENTIONS THAT MORE ADEQUATELY MEET THE NEEDS OF THE YOUTH IF PASSED CALIFORNIA WOULD JOIN ILLINOIS MINNESOTA NEW YORK BY ALLOWING YOU TO STATE THE SHELTERS FOR MORE THAN TWENTY ONE NIGHTS. AB TWELVE THIRTY FIVE OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THREE SMALL BUT SMART POLICY CHANGES WHICH WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY BE IMPACTFUL FOR A SMALL BUT VULNERABLE YOUTH POPULATION. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST DRIVE OF THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS ALSO THANK YOU TO COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL OF YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL. MY NAME IS AMANDA CLIFFORD AND I AM THE POLICY IN ADVOCACY ASSOCIATE FOR BILL WILSON CENTER I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE A STORY WITH YOU ABOUT A FAMILY WHO RECENTLY RECEIVED SERVICES AT BILL WISON CENTER. AT THE BEGINNING OF MAY A MOTHER'S THREE DROPPED OFF HER FIFTEEN YEAR OLD TWIN GIRLS AND ELEVEN YEAR OLD BOY. THE FAMILY COULD NOT FIND A FAMILY SHELTER THAT WOULD TAKE HER AND HER THREE CHILDREN SHE CONTINUED TO LIVE IN THE CAR WHILE HER CHILDREN WERE WITH US AT A RUN AWAY SHELTER. IMMEDIATELY A CASE MANAGER BEGAN TO WORK WITH THE MOTHER TO FIND AFFORDABLE HOUSING INEXPENSIVE MARKET OF SILICON VALLEY. WHILE WE WORK WITH MOM TO FIND HOUSING WE WERE ABLE TO KEEP THE THREE CHILDREN IN SCHOOL AND ON TRACK TO FINISH THE YEAR. THE CHILDREN RECEIVE COUNSELING AND SUPPORT SERVICES MOM VISITED FREQUENTLY AND WE WORK TOGETHER. THE GOAL OF FAMILY REUNIFICATION. THIS PAST FRIDAY THE FAMILY WILL BE REMOVED THIS PAST FRIDAY THE FAMILY WAS REUNITED AND LIVING TOGETHER IN STABLE HOUSING IF WE WERE LIMITED TO TWENTY ONE DAYS. THE FAMILY WOULD HAVE BEEN BACK LIVING IN THEIR CAR HOMELESS INSTEAD OF EASILY HOUSE IT TOOK BILL WILSON CENTER SIX WEEKS TO IDENTIFY STABLE HOUSING OPPORTUNITY. AND PREVENT FUTURE HOMELESSNESS FOR THE ENTIRE FAMILY BY EXPANDING THE DEFINITION OF AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS IT WOULD ALLOW MORE SHELTERS LIKE THE WILSON CENTER.

I UNDERSTAND THAT THE FUNDS THAT COME FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- FROM THE FEDERAL RUNAWAY AND HOMELESS YOUTH ACT -- CAN ONLY APPLY TO FOR TWENTY ONE FOR THAT TWENTY ONE DAYS THE NONPROFIT CENTER. AND THEN ALICE'S DID NOT SET A SERVICE AND CERTAIN HOW MUCH MONEY WAS THERE. SO I AGREE WITH YOU THAT FROM A STRICTLY POLICY STANDPOINT HAVING A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME MAKES SENSE. I I I I DID WANT TO JUST RAISE THE ISSUE ABOUT ARE THERE CONCERNS THAT WE'RE GONNA LOSE CAPACITY. SO THAT -- EVERY EVERY AT RISK OF LOSING ANY OF OF SOME CAPACITY. BY A LOSS OF THOSE FEDERAL FUNDS -- BECAUSE NOW I CAN'T PRESUME THAT THE STATE WOULD MAKE UP FOR THAT CELL -- THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION BUT ACCORDING TO OUR RESEARCH THIS HAS NOT COME UP IN ANY OF THE OTHER STATES THAT HAVE EXPANDED THEIR LENGTH OF STAY. SO MINNESOTA MINNESOTA NEW YORK IN ILLINOIS' HAVE NOT ENCOUNTERED THIS PROBLEM. YEAH. RIGHT THAT THAT SELF I JUST WANT TO BE SURE OF WE ARE WALKING INTO THIS EYES WIDE OPEN CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE HELPFULNESS OF HAVING A LONGER TIME AND I THINK TO THE DEGREE THAT WE CAN ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN. THAT'S GREAT -- I JUST WANT TO BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT NOT LOSING CAPACITY BECAUSE OF LOS FEDERAL FUNDING. OF THE BILL THE BILL WILSON CENTER IS ACTUALLY. A ORGANIZATION IN MY AREA THAT RUNS IS -- DAY DAY CENTERS AND A RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES. FOR MANY DECADES AND THEY'VE DONE A GREAT JOB. OF ONE DAY I WENT TO THE DAY CENTER OF BILL WILSON AND THEY WERE TAKING A TOUR OF IT AND MAN I'M SURE A WALK BY TOO CLOSE TO A PACK OF DOGS THAT WERE TIED UP AND EVIDENTLY THE YOUNG. WOMEN THAT WERE HOMELESS. WERE. ALL OF THE OWNERS OF VARIOUS DOGS. AND I GOT A LITTLE CLOSE IN ONE OF THE DOGS RUSHED OUT AND HIT ME IN THE IN THE IN THE FOOT. AT THE BILL WILSON DAYCARE CENTER.

HAD THE BILL QUESTION SO -- SO SHE ACTUALLY WENT ON BECAME A SOCIAL WORKER AND SHE'S NOW -- HOUSE LANE CHILDREN'S AT ONE OF THE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AND SILICON VALLEY SO SO A LOT OF THESE -- HOMELESS USE -- CAN AND WOULD BE. VERY IMPORTANT HOUSE AND I SO I SUPPORT THIS -- NINETY DAY I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE EXTEND THIS THIS WILL ALLOW US. TO HAVE THAT TRANSITION THAT'S NEEDED TO FIND THEM -- PERMANENT HOUSING.

ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH EACH YEAR IN CALIFORNIA NEARLY ONE THOUSAND CHILDREN DIE.

INITIAL HEALTHCARE COSTS AND THREE POINT FOUR BILLION IN ONGOING MEDICAL AND WAGE LOSS COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PREVENTABLE INJURIES. KIDS PLATES ARE ANY PERSONALIZED LICENSE PLATE WITH A STAR HANDPRINT PLUS SIGN OR HEART SHAPED. PART OF THE KIDS PLATES REVENUE FUNDS FOR CHILDHOOD UNINTENTIONAL INJURY PREVENTION PROGRAMS AT THE LOCAL AND STATEWIDE EXCUSE ME AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND STATEWIDE. THE LIST OF CHILDHOOD INJURY ISSUES HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED SINCE NINETEEN NINETY TWO TO REFLECT ALL OF THE EIGHT LEADING CAUSES OF CHILDHOOD UNINTENTIONAL INJURY ISSUES. AB THIRTEEN THIRTY SIX ADDS THE MISSING LEADING CAUSES OF UNINTENTIONAL INJURIES RESULTING IN THE HIGHEST FREQUENCY OF CHILDHOOD DEATHS AND HOSPITALIZATIONS FOR CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN AND YOUTH THROUGH THE AGE. NINETEEN THESE INCLUDE UNINTENTIONAL INJURIES INVOLVING VEHICLE BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN CRASHES. POISONING BURNS SUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME OR SIDS.

DISQUALIFIED FROM RECEIVING THIS GRANT THIS YEAR. BECAUSE WE HAD INCLUDED IN THERE A SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL PROGRAM WHICH GIVES CHILDREN EDUCATION ON BICYCLING AND WALKING TO SCHOOL SAFELY. BUT COME TO FIND OUT THAT PEDESTRIAN SAFETY IS NOT ON THE LIST OF AREAS THAT WE CAN USE TO EDUCATE. CHILDREN ON FROM THE KIDS PLATES FUNDING SO. THAT WE KNOW THAT CHILDREN NEED BOTH BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN SAFETY EDUCATION WE DIDN'T TYPICALLY DO THOSE TOGETHER KNOWING THAT THEY'LL NEED BOTH FORGETTING TO SCHOOL SAFELY ONE DAY THEY MIGHT WALK ONE DAY THEY MIGHT BACK. IN SO WE ALWAYS INCLUDE BOTH -- BUT NOW WE'VE HAD TO RE FRAME ARE GRANT PROGRAM TO MOSTLY EMPHASIZE THE BICYCLE SAFETY. SO WE HOPE THAT. THIS BILL WILL BE PASSED TO ADD TO THE LIST OF PARTY IMPORTANT ISSUES.

AND TO BIPARTISAN EFFORTS THAT RECOGNIZE THE VALUE OF SUPPORTING AND WELCOMING. IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES IN OUR STATE OCTOBER TENTH TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY PROPOSED NEW REGULATIONS REGARDING PUBLIC CHARGE DETERMINATIONS. THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS WOULD EXPAND THE LIST OF BENEFITS CONSIDERED WHEN DETERMINING WHO CONSTITUTES A PUBLIC CHARGE. BEYOND CASH ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS TO INCLUDE HEALTHCARE HOUSING.

THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS WOULD ALSO CONSIDER THE AGE OF AN INDIVIDUAL BEING UNDER EIGHTEEN AND OVER SIXTY ONE WOULD BE CONSIDERED A NEGATIVE.
