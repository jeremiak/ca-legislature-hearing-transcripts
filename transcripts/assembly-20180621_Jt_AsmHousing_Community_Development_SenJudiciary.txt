MY NAME IS DAVID CHIU WAI AND THE CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY HOUSING COMMITTEE VELTMAN COMMITTEE I WANT TO WELCOME ALL OF YOU TO THIS JOINT HEARING OF ARE SIMPLY HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE. AS WELL AS THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WE ARE JOINED BY THE CHAIR OF THAT COMMITTEE -- CENTER HANNAH BETH JACKSON TO MY LEFT. PURSUANT TO SP TWELVE FIFTY THREE CHAPTER SIX NINETY SEVEN STATUTES OF TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WHEN A STATEWIDE INITIATIVE REACHES 25% OF THE SIGNATURES NEEDED TO QUALIFY A MEASURE FOR THE BALLOT. THE INITIATIVE IS REFERRED TO LEGISLATIVE POLICY COMMITTEES FOR A HEARING. THIS IS THE HEARING ARE RELATED TO INITIATIVE EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN TO EXPAND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AUTHORITY TO ENACT RENT CONTROL ON RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY. LET ME STATE THAT THIS COMMITTEE CAN TAKE NO ACTION ON THE INITIATIVE BUT CAN HEAR TESTIMONY TO DESCRIBES INITIATIVE. AND POSITIONS FOR AND AGAINST. BEFORE WE GET STARTED I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO GIVE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THIS HEARING. WE WILL FIRST HEAR FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WHO WALK US THROUGH THE INITIATIVE THEY ARE NOT IN A POSITION TO GIVE US AN OPINION ON THE INITIATIVE. BUT RATHER CAN DESCRIBE INITIATIVE INCLUDING ITS FISCAL IMPACTS. WE WILL THEN HEAR FROM A PANEL OF WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AND A PANEL IN OPPOSITION TO THE INITIATIVE. EACH PANEL HAS A TOTAL OF THIRTY MINUTES. AFTER THE FORMAL PRESENTATIONS WE WILL OPEN UP THE HEARING TO PUBLIC COMMENT. MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC CAN STATE THEIR NAME THEIR POSITION ON THE INITIATIVE AND WHERE THEY'RE FROM IN THE STATE. WE NEED TO BE STRICT IN THIS REQUIREMENT SINCE WE HAVE MANY PEOPLE NOT ONLY IN THIS ROOM BUT IN OVERFLOW ROOMS WHO WANT TO TESTIFY ON EITHER SIDE AND WE WANT TO BE RESPECTFUL. OF EVERYONE'S TIME I'LL JUST SAY LOGISTICALLY NOW REPEAT THIS -- WHEN WE GET TO PUBLIC COMMENT WE'RE GONNA HAVE MICROPHONES BOTH ON THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT OF THE MAIN FLOOR OF THIS HEARING ROOM AS WELL AS IN? OUR THE BALCONY UP WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT FIRST FROM THE MAIN FLOOR THEN FROM THE BALCONY AFTER WE'VE HEARD FROM FOLKS FROM THE MAIN FLOOR WILL ASK PEOPLE TO DEPART. SO WE CAN BRING INDIVIDUALS FROM THE OVERFLOW -- INTO THIS HEARING ROOM SO THEY CAN ALSO TESTIFIED WE WILL DO THE SAME. UP WITH UP FOLKS IN THE BALCONY AND WILL ALTERNATE LEFT AND RIGHT ON THE MAIN FLOOR THEN LEFT TO RIGHT ON THE BALCONY AND THEN WILL CONTINUE BACK TO THE MAIN FLOOR -- WITH THAT -- AND I ALSO WANT TO STATE ONE OTHER THING DURING THIS -- WHICH IS IN THIS HEARING AS IS THE CASE IN OUR COMMITTEE HEARINGS THERE WILL BE NO APPLAUSE OR A OR EXPRESSIONS OF SUPPORT. UP OR OPPOSITION DURING ANYONE'S TESTIMONY OUT OF RESPECT TO THOSE WERE SPEAKING AND I RESPECT TO THOSE ARE WHO ARE COMING TO TESTIFY IN PUBLIC COMMENT SO WITH THAT.

I IS TO JUST SIMPLY CONSIDER WHETHER THERE IS ANY ROLE FOR US AS A LEGISLATURE BEFORE THE MATTER REACHES THE BALLOT BOX. AND THE ONLY POSSIBLE OUTCOMES WOULD OTHERWISE BE ALL OR NOTHING SO THE QUESTION THAT WE HAVE TO ASK IS ARE THERE OPPORTUNITIES HERE FOR INNOVATION -- CAN WE COME TOGETHER PERHAPS AROUND ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS THAT EVERYONE CAN SUPPORT A OR IS OUR COMMON GROUND THAT THAT IS OUR JOB AND AS I MENTIONED I KNOW THAT THIS IS A VERY -- CHARGED THE SUBJECT -- AND WE EXPECT STRONG FEELINGS THAT THAT WE KNOW THEY'RE BEEN STRONG DISAGREEMENTS ON THIS TOPIC. AND JOB I'D LIKE TO SUGGEST BECAUSE WE CANNOT SUPPORT HAVING INTERFERENCE IF YOU LIKE SOMETHING. I'VE LEARNED FROM YOUNG PEOPLE THIS IS A WAY THAT CLAP. AND IT WORKS -- THE SO THAT WE CAN STILL CONTINUE WITH OUR HEARING AND TOM. AGAIN RECOGNIZING AS WE DO THAT ARE ROLL HERE TODAY IS SOMEWHAT LIMITED BUT THIS IS A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND I A UP APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT EVERYONE'S HERE I MADE INDICATE I'VE GOTTA RUN IN AND OUT A BIT AND I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO STAY FOR PUBLIC.

UP WITH THAT WE DO HAVE -- TO MEMBERS FROM THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ON OUR CENTERS MORE LOCK OR WHITE HOUSE IF YOU HAVE ANY OPENING COMMENTS CENTER MORE LUCK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IS A JUST HAD. LIKE SORT OF A QUESTION FOR BACKGROUND PURPOSES. OWN RITUAL PROPERTY. HOW MANY OF US ON THE PANEL OWN RENTAL PROPERTY I DO NOT KNOW THAT? I I DO NOT I DO NOT.

I HAVE RENTAL PROPERTY AND IT SAYS SPECIAL CALLING -- TOO HOPE WE FILL UP YOUR APARTMENT -- BUILDING AND KEEP IT MAINTAINED AND SO THERE'S A REAL SPECIAL PERSONALITY THAT THAT IT TAKES TO BE A LANDLORD IT'S NOT AN EASY. JOBS ARE. JUST ONE ACCOUNT. PROVIDE THAT PERSPECTIVE AS WE ENJOY TODAY SESSION THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR WHY BECAUSE ANY COMMENTS. AND AND I WOULD JUST SAY IN RESPONSE TO CENTER MORE LOCK -- WE ALL KNOW AND I THINK WE ALL WOULD AGREE THAT OUR STATE IS IN THE MOST INTENSE. HOUSING CRISIS EVER IN OUR STATE HISTORY THE MOST INTENSE TENER CRISIS IN OUR SEATS HISTORY MOST INTENT EVICTION CRISIS IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY. I'M I SUPPORTED LEGISLATION THAT -- THAT WAS A SIMILAR POST -- THAT IS LEGISLATION THAT DID NOT MOVE FORWARD IN THIS LEGISLATURE OUT WE HAVE A BALLOT MEASURE IN FRONT OF US. LIKE CENTER JACKSON -- I THINK THEY'RE MANY OF US WOULD HOPE THAT WE BE ABLE TO RESOLVE THESE ISSUES HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THAT MAY NOT COME TO PASS -- AND SO WE HAVE A BALLOT MEASURE AND IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS MEMBERS OF THESE COMMITTEES TO HOLD THIS HEARING SO THAT THE PUBLIC CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS BELT MEASURE COULD ENTAIL. ARE AND CAN HELP MAKE DECISIONS AROUND IT SO WITHOUT A LESSER ANY OTHER COMMENTS. AND WE WILL PROCEED TO OUR FIRST PANEL I'D LIKE TO ASK -- BRAIN YOU ARE FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE IF YOU COULD PLEASE COME TO THE DYESS -- HE IS THE PRINCIPAL FISCAL POLICY ANALYST FOR THE ALEJO HE WILL PROVIDE AND THE NEXT AN OVERVIEW THE INITIATIVE AS WELL AS AN EVALUATION OF THE FISCAL IMPACTS OF THIS -- AND ALTERNATE OVER TO YOU. YES I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR GRANULAR FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND I YOU DID TOUCH ON THIS A LITTLE BIT BUT I WANTED TO START OFF WITH A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT IN OUR ON OUR OFFICES ROLE IN THE INITIATIVE PROCESS. WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT FROM OUR ROLE IN THE POLICY OF THE BUDGET PROCESS WHERE WE OFTEN -- MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS OR COMMENT ON THE MERITS OF POLICY CHANGES THE ROLE GIVEN US BUT GIVEN TO US BY THE VOTERS AND THE INITIATIVE PROCESS -- IS TO BE AN OBJECTIVE IMPARTIAL THIRD PARTY OTHER FOCUSES ON EVALUATING THE FISCAL EFFECTS OF A MEASURE WITHOUT TAKING ANY POSITION. ON THE MERITS OF THE POLICY CHANGE AND SO WITH THAT IN MIND I PREPARED A PRESENTATION FOR THE COMMITTEES TODAY. OTHER WHILE FOR SOME -- CONTEXT IN BACKGROUND A FOR THE MEASURE DESCRIBED THE KEY ASPECTS OF THE MEASURE AND SUMMARIZE OUR FISCAL ANALYSIS. STARTING WITH THE BACKGROUND -- RENTAL HOUSING CALIFORNIA IS EXPENSIVE -- THE TYPICAL RETURN CALIFORNIA PAYS ABOUT 50% MORE THAN THE TYPICAL RETURN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY AND IN SOME PARTS OF THE STATE. RENTS ARE MORE THAN DOUBLE -- WHAT THEY ARE THE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE -- IN HIGH HOUSING COSTS ARE NOT A RECENT PHENOMENON AS EARLY AS THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE STRUGGLED WITH HOW TO ADDRESS. HIGH HOUSING COSTS AND IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES SEVERAL COMMUNITIES INCLUDING SEVERAL LARGE CITIES SUCH AS LA. SAN FRANCISCO AND SAN JOSE ADOPTED LAWS KNOWN AS RENT CONTROL OR RENT STABILIZATION THAT LIMIT HOW MUCH RENTS LANDLORDS CAN INCREASE RENTS. FROM ONE YEAR TO THE NEXT AND OFTEN RING INCREASES ARE PAID TO SOME MEASURE OF INFLATION. SUCH AS THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX. TODAY ABOUT 20% OF THE STATE'S RENTAL HOUSING STOCK FALLS UNDER SOME SORT OF LOCAL RENT CONTROL. OF FOLLOWING THEPASSAGE OF THIS COLLECTION OF RENT CONTROL MEASURES IN THE SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES -- BOTH ACTIONS BY THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND BY THE COURTS OF PLAY SOME -- LIMITS ON THE SCOPE OF LOCAL RENT CONTROL LAWS. IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE THE LEGISLATURE PASSED THE COSTA HAWKINS RENTAL HOUSING ACT WHICH PLACED THREE A KEY LIMITS ON THE LOCAL RENT CONTROL. FIRST IT'S A LOCAL RENT CONTROL CANNOT APPLY TO ANY SINGLE FAMILY HOMES. A SECOND LOCAL RENT CONTROL CANNOT APPLY TO ANY NEWLY BUILT HOUSING -- COMPLETED HONOR AFTER FEBRUARY FIRST. NINETEEN NINETY FIVE AND FINALLY COSTA HAWKINS REQUIRED WHAT IS KNOWN AS VACANCY TO CONTROL WHICH MEANS THAT A LANDLORD MUST BE FREE TO RESET RENTS TO MARKET RATES WHEN TRANSITIONING FROM ONE TEN IT -- TO THE NEXT. COURT RULINGS OF ALSO PLAY SOME LIMITATIONS ON THE SCOPE OF LOCAL RENT CONTROL SPECIFICALLY A COLLECTION OF RULINGS HAS REQUIRED THAT LANDLORDS A BE ABLE TO RECEIVE A SO CALLED FAIR RATE OF RETURN. AND WHILE THE DEFINITION OF FAIR RATE OF RETURN IS A BIT AMBIGUOUS IN CONTEXT SPECIFIC I THINK THE THE GENERAL IDEA -- IS THAT RENTS BE ALLOWED TO INCREASE A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT TO ALLOW THE LANGUAGE RETURNED TO NOT BE ERODED OVER TIME -- BY INFLATION. SO TURNING TO THE CHANGES PROPOSED BY THE MEASURE THERE ARE TWO KEY CHANGES FIRST IS TO REPEAL COSTA HAWKINS IN ITS ENTIRETY -- THIS WOULD ALLOW -- LOCAL ENTITIES TO IMPOSE RENT CONTROL ON SINGLE FAMILY HOMES. OR HOMES CONSTRUCTED -- AFTER. NINETEEN NINETY FIVE IT WOULD ALSO ALLOW LOCAL ORDINANCES TO INCORPORATE VACANCY CONTROL WHICH WOULD LIMIT HOW MUCH RENTS COULD INCREASE -- WHEN TRANSITIONING A RENTAL UNIT FROM ONE TENANT? TO THE NEXT. OF THE OTHER CHANGE IN THE MEASURE IS TO PLACE INTO STATUTE THE REQUIREMENT THAT LANDLORDS -- BE ABLE TO RECEIVE A FAIR RATE OF RETURN -- IN THIS IS LARGELY CODIFYING THE RESULT OF THE PAST COURT RULINGS -- THAT I MENTIONED. I FINALLY TURNING TO OF THE SUMMARY OF OUR ANALYSIS OF THE MEASURES FISCAL FAX. I WANNA START WITH A COUNTY ARE THAT WE'RE STILL FINALIZING OUR ANALYSIS THAT WILL SHOW UP IN THE VOTER GUIDE IN THE NOVEMBER ELECTION VOTER MATERIALS -- AND SO WHAT I'M ABOUT TO DISCUSS OUR OUR OUR PRELIMINARY RESULTS WHICH ARE LARGELY BASED ON THE ANALYSIS WE UNDERTOOK BACK IN THE WINNER. WHEN THIS MEASURE WAS THAT THE TITLE AND SUMMARY STAGE -- WITHOUT IN MIND THE THE ECONOMIC AND FISCAL EFFECTS OF THE MEASURE WOULD DEPEND A LARGELY ON FUTURE ACTIONS TAKEN BY -- CITIES AND COUNTIES. REPEALING COSTA HAWKINS IN AND OF ITSELF DOESN'T MAKE ANY CHANGES TO LOCAL RENT CONTROL ORDINANCES -- IF THERE WAS GOING TO BE ANY EXPANSION OR CREATION A NEW RING CONTROL RULES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THAT WOULD TAKE. ADDITIONAL ACTIONS FROM LOCAL COMMUNITIES. THAT BEING SAID SHOULD COMMUNITIES RESPOND TO THIS MEASURE BY EXPANDING OR BY IMPLEMENTING NEW RENT CONTROL RULES. OF THAT HAVE A VARIETY OF ECONOMIC AND FISCAL FAX -- BASED ON THE ECONOMIC RESEARCH OF THE MOST LIKELY ECONOMIC EFFECTS ARE THE FOLLOWING FIRST SOME LANDLORDS -- WOULD CONVERT THEIR RENTAL PROPERTIES TWO CONDOS OR OTHER FORMS OF OWNERSHIP HOUSING IN THIS WOULD SHIFT THE COMPOSITION OF THE HOUSING STOCK IN ANY COMMUNITY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF RENTALS AVAILABLE. AND INCREASING THE NUMBER OF UNITS THAT ARE FOR SALE -- SECOND THE VALUE OF RENTAL HOUSING WOULD DECLINE AS PROSPECTIVE LANDLORDS WOULD BE WILLING TO PAY LESS FOR RENT CONTROLLED -- UNITS. A THIRD A SO RENTERS IN RENT CONTROLLED UNITS WOULD SPEND LESS ON RENTS AND THEIR LANDLORDS WOULD RECEIVE LESS RENTAL INCOME. AND FINALLY RENTERS WOULD -- MOVE LESS OFTEN THIS WOULD INCLUDE -- FEWER INVOLUNTARY MOVES -- WHERE RENTERS -- ARE ESSENTIALLY FORCED TO MOVE BY A RENT INCREASE THAT THEY CAN'T AFFORD AND IT COULD ALSO INCLUDE -- SUMMER TRIPS FOR GOING A MOVE THAT MAY BE OTHERWISE ADVANTAGES FOR THEM TO MOVE CLOSER WORKER FAMILY OF A DAY FOR GO THAT MOVE TO MAINTAIN THE RELATIVELY LOW RENT OF THEIR RENT CONTROLLED UNIT. OF THESE ECONOMIC EFFECTS COULD HAVE A DOWNSTREAM IMPLICATIONS FOR OF VARIOUS STATE AND LOCAL REVENUES. THE ULTIMATE MAGNITUDE OF THESE EFFECTS ON STATE LOCAL REVENUES ARE UNCLEAR IS THEY WOULD -- LARGELY DEPEND ON THAT THE TYPE AND TIMING OF ACTIONS TAKEN BY LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN RESPONSE TO THE REPEAL OF COSTA HAWKINS. HOWEVER THE IN GENERAL WE SEE THREE MAJOR CHANGES THE STATE LOCAL REVENUES FIRST A LANDLORDS WOULD PAY A LET'S PROPERTY TAXES AS THE VALUE OF THEIR RENTAL PROPERTIES -- WOULD GO DOWN. SECOND RANGERS WOULD HAVE INCREASED DISPOSABLE INCOME. SOME OF WHICH THEY WOULD SPEND ON TAXABLE GOODS AND THIS WOULD LEAD TO A MORE SALES TAX REVENUE. AND FINALLY A LANDLORDS A PERSONAL INCOME TAX PAYMENTS WOULD CHANGE -- WHETHER OR NOT THEY WOULD GO UP OR DOWN -- IS DIFFICULT THE SAME IT DEPENDS SOMEWHAT ON WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE FOCUSING ON THE SHORT TERM. OR THE LONG TERM -- THAT THEIR SEVERAL MOVING PIECES WITHIN THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX FEES ON THE ONE HAND LANDLORDS WOULD BE RECEIVING LESS RENTAL INCOME AND THEREFORE THEIR TAXABLE INCOME WOULD BE LOWER AND THEY WOULD PAY LOWER INCOME TAX BECAUSE OF THAT. ON THE OTHER HAND LANDLORDS RECEIVE A VARIETY OF DEDUCTIONS AGAINST THEIR TAXABLE INCOME OTHER BASED ON THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY SUCH AS PROPERTY TAX DEDUCTION MORTGAGE INTEREST DEDUCTION -- AND APPRECIATION OF ALL OF IF LANDLORDS WERE PAYING LESS TO ACQUIRE PROPERTY ON THIS REDUCTION IN THESE DEDUCTIONS WOULD IT WOULD EFFECTIVELY INCREASE THE TAXABLE INCOME OF LANDLORDS. AND LEADS THEM PAYING HIGHER INCOME TAX PAYMENTS OF THE THE OVERALL NET EFFECT OF THESE MOVING PIECES IS NOT CLEAR ESPECIALLY -- AND THE LONG TERM. TAKING ALL THE STATE AND LOCAL REVENUE AFFECTS TOGETHER. AGAIN THE OVERALL MAGNITUDE -- IS IS -- IS UNCLEAR I AM WHEN LARGELY DEPEND ON THE TYPE AND TIMING OF LOCAL OF ACTIONS TAKEN BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOLLOWING THE PASSAGE OF THIS MEASURE -- AND WITH THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO ME ASK IF THERE ANY QUESTIONS CENTER WIECKOWSKI. I'M ON THE CHANGES OF STATE AND LOCAL REVENUES HELP ME OUT HERE BECAUSE PROPERTY REAL PROPERTY TAXES ARE SAYS BY THE COUNTY ASSESSOR. SOME WOULD ARGUE THAT SOME PART IN OUR COMPLEXES HAVE BEEN ARTIFICIALLY LOW ON THE ASSESSMENTS BECAUSE THEY WERE PROP THIRTEEN AND THEY'VE THEY GOT THEY GOT A SPECIAL TREAT BACK IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN SO IF THEY IF THEY ACTUALLY HAD THE AUDACITY TO GO INTO THE ASSESSOR AND CHALLENGE THE ASSESSED VALUE OF THEIR PROPERTY DOZEN THAT OPEN THE DOOR FOR THE ASSESSOR TO LOOK AT THE TRUE VALUE. OF THAT BUILDING IF THEY'RE GOING TO SAY THAT THEY'VE LOST INCOME THAT COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES WORTH LESS BECAUSE IF I MAKE LESS IS AN ATTORNEY I DON'T GO TO THE ASSESSMENT SAY HEY MY BUILDINGS WORTH LESS. WALK ME THROUGH THAT HOW THAT WILL HELP WITH THAT WORK. SO YOU'RE CERTAINLY RIGHT THAT -- THERE WOULD BE THERE WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT LAG IN THE EFFECT OF THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. A DECLINE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF A RENTAL PROPERTY AND THE DECLINE IN THE ASSESSMENT OF THE REAL PROPERTY -- AND NOT LIKE IT'S CREATED BY PROPOSITION THIRTEEN AND ESSENTIALLY UP FOR MOST PROPERTIES -- EVEN IF -- YOU KNOW IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE MEASURE PASSES THERE SOME DECLINE IN THEIR MARKET VALUE FOR MOST OF THOSE PROPERTIES THEY WOULDN'T SEE A DECLINE IN THEIR SUSSMAN BECAUSE YOU'RE CORRECT. MOST PROPERTIES ARE SUCH THAT SOMETHING WELL -- THAT BEING SAID SOME PROPERTIES WOULD TURN OVER EACH YEAR AND AND THEIR SALE PRICE WOULD BE LOWER THAN IT OTHERWISE WOULD BE -- AND SO THEY WOULD ESSENTIALLY BE ENROLLED AT A LOWER SALE PRICE AND GOING FORWARD WOULD BE TAXED SOMEWHAT LESS THAN THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE THAT MAKE SENSE. TRUE BUT WOULDN'T WE GET WITH THEM WE GET THE TRUE UP THE FIRST TIME THAT AT SOUL BECAUSE BECAUSE SOMEBODY IS PAYING PROPERTY TAXES AND LET'S GO BACK TO ITS NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN ON A BUILDING THAT THEY FOUGHT FOR A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. THAT'S WORTH THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN. ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHOOSE IN MY AREA SO THEN THAT FIRST PERSON THAT PAID THAT THE THREE MILLION DOLLARS. THEY WOULD BE PAYING. THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN PROPERTY TAXES WITH THE OTHER GUYS ONLY PAN A GRAND NOW THE SECOND SALE WHERE THAT NOW THOUGH REN HAS BEEN. DEPRECIATED VER AND THEY SELL THAT THEY OFFLOAD THAT PROPERTY FOR TWO POINT SEVEN I AGREE WITH YOUR ANALYSIS THAT THE OUT WITH. IN THE LARGE PICTURE BUT THE TRUE UP OF SO MANY RENTAL PROPERTIES THAT ARE THE MARK THE ASSESSED VALUE SO LOW TO THE MARKET VALUE. YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT THAT THAT FIRST SALE IS GOING TO BE. A A A A POSSIBLE INCREASE IN PROPERTY TAXES BECAUSE THEY ARTIFICIALLY LOW THAT'S MY OBSERVATION. SO I THINK -- WHAT YOU'RE ARGUING I WOULD BE TRUE IF WE EXPECTED OF THE -- THE REPEAL COSTA HAWKINS TO LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN LANDLORDS ARE SELLING THEIR PROPERTIES AND I THINK SOME HAVE ARGUED THAT I DON'T THINK IT'S THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH -- IN OF IT -- INCURABLE RESEARCH TO JUSTIFY ONE ASSUMPTION OR THE OTHER IF THERE WERE AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER LIMITS ON PROPERTIES I THINK YOU WOULD BE RIGHT EVEN IF THEY WERE SELLING FOR LESS THAN THAT THAN THEY OTHERWISE WOULD. JUST THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE MORE TURNOVER. COULD LEAD TO AN INCREASE IMPROPER WHAT WE WOULD EVER SEE BUT I THINK -- I WE I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO MAKE THAT KIND OF ASSUMPTION [inaudible] SAM LOOKED [inaudible] CHAIR -- ARE YOU LEADER. SURE REVIEWING THE WHOLE STATE PICTURE DID YOU LOOK AT THE IMPACTS THAT IT MIGHT HAVE ON OUR PENSION SYSTEMS FOR THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. CALPERS MCALISTER'S BECAUSE THEY INVEST. WHAT 10% OF THEIR PORTFOLIOS IN REAL ESTATE? WE WE HAVE REVIEWED SOME -- INFORMATION ON THE AFFECT ON THE PENSION SYSTEMS -- AND BUT TO BE HONEST IT WASN'T THE OF THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF OUR ANALYSIS THE THE MAGNITUDE OF THOSE IMPACTS. SEEM RELATIVELY SMALL COMPARED TO THE CHANGES IN THE THE MAJOR REVENUES OTHER I MENTIONED SO OUR FOCUS HAS BEEN KIND OF ON THE ON THE MAJOR STATE AND LOCAL REVENUE SOURCES -- INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS LIKE CALPERS HAPPEN. STATEMENTS BELIEF IN HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE. TO SEE IF THEY HAVE A OF STATEMENT ON RENT CONTROL. I I HAVE NOT -- REVIEWED THAT NO BUT YOU'RE PUTTING TOGETHER A BALLOT ANALYSIS. MAYBE YOU COULD CHECK INTO THAT. BECAUSE WE CERTAINLY WANT TO BE CAREFUL THAT ARE RETIREES GET THEIR BENEFITS OVER TIME WE DON'T RESTRICT. PERHAPS THE ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUES -- THROUGH RENTAL PROPERTIES A BITE LARGE COMPLEXES -- AND SO. WE MIGHT EVEN SEE CALPERS MCALISTER'S SAYING MAYBE. LA OR SAN FRANCISCO IS NOT SOMEWHERE WHERE GET INVOLVED IN THE RENTAL. ARENA MAYBE DO IT IN INDIANA OR SOMEWHERE ELSE AND I IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF YOU IF YOU WOULD. LOOK INTO THAT AND PROVIDE. SOME INFORMATION BECAUSE MISTER CHAIR LOWER. LOWER YIELDS EQUAL TIRE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THEM THEREFORE CAN LEAD TO HIGHER TAXES FOR ALL OF US AND SO. THIS ISSUE AND HAVE A AN INDIRECT -- BEARING ON ALL OF US. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU -- WITH NO FURTHER QUESTIONS I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ANALYSIS WITH A FOUR TIER FINAL ANALYSIS AS THE MEASURE MOVES FORWARD. OF AND WILL EXCUSE YOU AT THIS TIME. BOB I LIKE TO CALL UP OF THE FIRST OF TWO PANELS ISN'T I MENTION BEFORE AT WE'RE GOING TO GIVE THIRTY MINUTES TO THE SUPPORT SIDE AND THIRTY MINUTES TO THE OPPOSITION SIDE. BOTH SIDES HAVE FOUR WITNESSES SO I LIKE TO FIRST CALL UP THE SUPPORTERS ARE AND WE HAVE A FOUR AND I'LL BRING YOU UP AND ASK YOU -- TO AT TO IDENTIFY YOURSELF INTRODUCED HERSELF AND I BELIEVE YOU HAVE ALREADY DECIDED.

GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS SHERRY HEADINGS. ADVOCATES OF TODAY TO SPEAK ABOUT REPEALING COSTA HAWKINS. IT ALLOWS CITIES TO EXPAND RENT CONTROL. OF COULD VERY. MUCH BENEFIT PEOPLE LIKE ME. SINCE NINETEEN SO IT'S TWENTY THIRTEEN I'VE LIVED IN A SINGLE FAMILY HOME IN LOS ANGELES THAN WESTMONT -- NEIGHBORHOOD. MY HOUSE IS OWNED BY -- IMITATE WHICH IS ONE OF THE LARGEST CORPORATE LANDLORDS -- WELL MY NEIGHBORHOOD IS UNOFFICIALLY KNOWN AS DEATH VALLEY -- BECAUSE OF THE MURDERS THAT ARE TAKING PLACE ABOUT -- LIKE OF FORM MILE ZONE WHERE I LIVE I LOVE MY HOME AND I LOVE MY COMMUNITY -- EVERY SAID YEAH I SERVE DINNERS -- AT MY HOUSE MY FAMILIES AND FRIENDS AND ANYBODY. CAN A TEN AND ACTIVE IN MY COMMUNITY AND ALL MY FAMILY AND I ALSO FEED THE HOMELESS REGULARLY. MY DAUGHTER AND GRANDDAUGHTER MOVED ACROSS THE STREET FROM ME TODAY IN THE SAME NEIGHBORHOOD AS ME AS I AM SO LEAVE IT WOULD BE DEVASTATING -- AND IF I HAD TO LEAVE I WOULD HAVE. TO OF COME OUT WITH TWO MONTHS RENTS AND YOU KNOW A DEPOSIT TO HAVE -- TO LOU. I THINK HAVE BEEN ABLE TO STAND MY WHOLE WHICH HASN'T BEEN EASY -- BUT EVERY TWO YEARS -- MY MY INVITATION HOMES HAS OF OVER BONE LEASE RENEWAL. AND EACH OTHER SO I'VE HAD OUR ELISE RENEWAL I WAS OFFER A PROPOSED FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH INCREASE. AND I WASN'T ABLE TO DO TO PAY THAT SO I CONTACTED MY PORTFOLIO MANAGER AND HE WAS ABLE TO NEGOTIATE WITH ME AFTER A WHILE. THAT -- FOR THE TWENTY FIFTEEN THERE INCREASE MY RENT MY HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. AND THEY WOULD TWENTY SIXTEEN K. MIKE HAD ANOTHER INCREASE -- OF A HUNDRED DOLLARS PER MONTH. TWENTY SEVENTEEN WAS A RENEWAL TIME AND AGAIN I GOT ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR -- PROPOSED INCREASE PER MY I WAS ABLE TO NEGOTIATE ONCE AGAIN THEY OKAY WE ARE RENTAL INCREASE OF A HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. AND TWENTY SIX TAMED. A HUNDRED THOUSAND LIGHT IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND I'LL TAKE THE NEXT HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH COME JULY. OF THIS YEAR -- I ASKED HOW DID THEY GET THERE -- INCREASES FOR MY PROPERTY. AND THEY WERE ABLE TO GIVE ME RENTS FOR A FEW HOUSES AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD. AND TELL ME THAT THIS HOUSE READ THROUGH THIS THIS HOUSE TO ENSURE THAT -- BUT ON THE SECOND INCREASE I'D I CALLED THE CORPORATE IN DALLAS AND ASKED HIM YOU KNOW IF THEY COULD JUST YOU KNOW INFORM ME HOW THEY TALLY IT UP AND AGAIN THEY DO IS THEY WAS TELL ME ABOUT THE DIFFERENT HOUSES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT YOU KNOW THAT WERE. SAME IS LYING SAME SQUARE FOOTAGE AND WHAT THEY WERE COSTING CHO. BUT I THINK GOD I WAS ABLE TO NEGOTIATE IN ALL MY RENTAL INCREASE DOWN. TO WHERE I COULD STAND MY HOME BECAUSE I KNOW THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE. HAVE LOST THEIR HOMES BECAUSE OF THE INCREASES. OF THE COSTA HAWKINS DOESN'T CURRENTLY ALLOW WEIGHT CONTROL TO EXPAND TO SINGLE FAMILY HOMES LIKE MINE. IT DESPITE OF MY PUPPY PROPERTY BEING -- OLD BY -- MY PATH IS NOT ONLY BY -- I'M SORRY. FAMILY OR SMALL IT DIDN'T. THE PROPERTY COMPANY IS OWNED BY ONE OF THE LARGEST -- CORPORATE LANDLORDS IF THERE IS -- I JUST WANTED A QUOTE IN JAMES TWO FOUR IN TO IN THE BIBLE IS IS WE HAVE NOT BECAUSE WE ASK THAT. AND WHILE I WAS VERY BLESSED AGAIN LIKE I SAY TO NEGOTIATE MY RED. AND TO STAND MY HOME I KNOW THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WEREN'T ABLE TO DO THAT. AND I LOVE MY HOME AND IT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS I KNOW WHEN I TALK TO MY PORTFOLIO MANAGER. AND I ALSO A EXPRESSED TO HIM THE YOU KNOW ANYBODY CAN COUNT ON THE WHOLE ON SUNDAY IN YOU'D GET SUNDAY DINNER HILL THOUGH. AND THAT'S THE THING I TELL PEOPLE DAHLE KNOCK ON THE DOOR ON A SUNDAY YOU WALKING IN BECAUSE YOUR FAMILY [inaudible] AND IT'S OLD AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY YOU KNOW WOULD BE DEVASTATED IF I HAD TO TO LEAVE -- WOULD WIN CONTROL. I WOULD HAVE TO IN TWO YEARS HAVE TO WONDER WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. YOU KNOWING. TWENTY NINETEEN I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT FVE HUNDRED DOLLAR -- INCREASE FROM MY COMING BACK AT ME OR YOU KNOW EVEN MORE I DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW. SO -- I'M ONE OF THE BEST ONES TENSE IMITATION HOMES BEGAN FIVE YEARS AGO I'M ONE THE ONLY ONES THOUGH STILL. A TENANT BEER AND I WAS ASKED THIS YEAR TO SIGN A NEW LEASE THAT EVERYBODY ELSE WAS ON IN MY PORTFOLIO MANAGERS SAYS. I WAS THE ONLY ONE IS STILL COULD PAY MY RENT ON THE SIX OF THEM MIGHT NOT BE LAID. BUT AS A TWENTY SEVENTEEN I HAD TO SIGN A NEW AGREEMENT LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE THEY HAVE THEY RENT PAID BY THE THIRD. SO I HAVE BEEN UP THE PART OF INVITATION HOME SINCE THE BEGINNING. A LOS -- IT A GIANT JULY NINETEENTH LEGACY MY RENEWAL WILL COME UP AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW IT WILL BE AT THAT TIME -- BECAUSE ARE HAWKINS CURRENTLY ALLOWS -- WE COULD SHOW TO BE EXPANDED. WELL CASA HARKEN DOESN'T CURRENTLY ALLOW MAKE YOU TOLD ME EXPAND IN A SINGLE FAMILY HOUSE LIKE MY DESPITE. MY PROBABLY MEAN OLD BY. OF A FAMILY OR A SMALL PROPERTY OWNER. THE PEOPLE. COSTA HAWKINS WAS MEANT TO PROTECT [inaudible] AND GIVEN THE M. SUCCESSFUL THIS TIME AND NEGOTIATING MY RENT YOU KNOW I WOULD TO HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS. TO GO ELSEWHERE BUT AGAIN I LOVE MY I LOVE MY HOME MY LOVE MY COMMUNITY I LOVE THE AND A PART OF IT. AND I JUST YOU KNOW WOULD LOVE TO HAVE GREAT CONTROLLED SO I COULD STAY WHERE I AM. BUT I WOULD LIKE THAT -- OTHER PEOPLE FOR THAT ARE HERE TO SUPPORT COSTA HAWKINS DO STAND IF YOU WOULD [inaudible] NO NO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY WITH THAT -- APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY LET'S GO NOW TO THE SECOND WITNESS A DOCTOR PETER TRACK [inaudible] MORNING -- INVITING ME HERE. I MANY WITH PETER DREIER I'M THE CHAIR OF THE URBAN ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY DEPARTMENT. AT OCCIDENTAL COLLEGE IN LOS ANGELES BEFORE THAT -- I WAS THE DIRECTOR OF HOUSING FOR THE CITY OF BOSTON WHERE WE HAVE. WELL A WRECK CONTROL LAW. LA I MOVED HERE IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE AND I WAS ACTUALLY HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE IN. NINETEEN NINETY FIVE TESTIFYING AGAINST THE COSTA HAWKINS LAW WHEN IT WAS FIRST PROPOSED THAT IF YOU WERE HERE AT THE TIME SO. YOU -- I DON'T BLAME ANY OF YOU FOR THE CRISIS THAT IT HAD SUED -- AS YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA OR THE WORST HOUSING CRISIS IN THE COUNTRY ARE HOMES. PRICES ARE RENTS ARE ABOVE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE -- AND HIGHER THAN EVERY OTHER STATE EXCEPT FOR HAWAII. HAVE THE WIDEST GAP BETWEEN INCOMES. AND HOUSING COSTS. HOUSING PRICES OF ESCALATED MUCH FASTER THAN INCOMES AND NOT SURPRISINGLY THE HOMEOWNERSHIP RATE IN CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN STEADILY GOING DOWN WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IT MEANS THAT. MANY MIDDLE INCOME RENTERS. WHO USED TO BE HOMEOWNERS THERE WOULD'VE BEEN HOMEOWNERS ARE NOW COMPETING WITH WORKING CLASS? AND LOW INCOME RENTERS FOR THE SECURE SUPPLY. OF RENTAL HOUSING THIS HOPPED ACTUALLY INCREASES RENT. UP WHICH HAVE INCREASED US SINCE TWO THOUSAND ARE TWICE AS FAST AS INCOMES. IN CALIFORNIA WOULD HIDE BECAUSE THE FAIR MARKET RENT FOR A TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT IS A SIXTEEN HUNDRED NINETY NINE DOLLARS A MONTH -- FAMILY NEEDS AN INCOME OF SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR TO AFFORD THAT THAT'S CALLED. THE HOUSING WAGE ARE YOU NEED AN INCOME. OF THIRTY TWO DOLLARS AND AN HOUR. JUST TO AFFORD -- THE THAT THAT FAIR MARKET RENT A HOME MOST CALIFORNIANS DON'T EARN ANYTHING CLOSE TO THAT -- SO FOR THAT -- TWO BEDROOM FAIR MARKET RENT APARTMENT UP FOR THE FOR THE HOUSING WAGE IT'S VARIES AROUND THE STATE BUT IT'S HIGH IN ALMOST EVERY PLACE. IT'S OVER TWENTY DOLLARS AN HOUR RIVERSIDE IN SACRAMENTO SALINAS CENTER WITH OBISPO KILO COUNTY. IT'S OVER THIRTY DOLLARS AN HOUR IN OAKLAND AND I NOT START IN SAN DIEGO. SANTA ROSA SANTA ANA ANAHEIM IRVINE LA LONG BEACH GLENDALE SANTA BARBARA SANTA MARIA -- AND A SANTA CRUZ WATSONVILLE IT'S OVER FORTY DOLLARS AN HOUR THE HOUSING WAGE IN OAKLAND AND SAN JOSE. AND IT IS SIXTY DOLLARS AN HOUR IN SAN FRANCISCO. CALIFORNIA A 54% OF THE RECORDS PAY OVER 30% OF THEIR INCOME FOR HOUSING TO HIGHEST IN THE COUNTRY -- AND 29% ALMOST A THIRD OF ALL THE RENTERS AND CALIFORNIA. SPENT OVER HALF OF THEIR INCOME JUST TO HAVE A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD. I WE'RE HERE TODAY BECAUSE COSTA HAWKINS TOOK AWAY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TOOLS THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING CRISIS. IT'S ONE OF THE MAJOR IMPEDIMENTS CITIES ARE TO RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO THE YOU'D RENT INCREASES THAT ARE STABILIZING OUR PEOPLE ARE FAMILIES OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR LOCAL ECONOMIES. AND SINCE THE COSTA HAWKINS ACT WAS PASSED IN. NINETY FIVE THE WORD CRISIS IS GOTTEN WORSE. THERE ARE THREE MAJOR PROVISIONS AS YOU'VE HEARD OF THE COSTA HAWKINS ACT THERE ARE OBSTACLES TO ADDRESSING THE HOUSING CRISIS. THE FIRST IS COSTA HAWKINS PREVENTS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM ACTING MEANINGFUL RENT CONTROL. BECAUSE THE KIDS AT PROHIBITS CITIES FROM REGULATING RENTS WHEN A UNIT BECOMES VACANT. THIS CREATES A PERVERSE INCENTIVE FOR A LANDLORD THREE VIC TENANTS OFTEN BY ILLEGAL MEANS ACCORDING HARASSED AND THIS HAPPENS ALL OVER THE STATE. EVEN THE STRONGEST FORMS OF RENT CONTROL THOUGH DO NOT FREEZE RENTS RECKON TROLL ALL HOURS. WHEN WORDS TO STEADILY INCREASE THEIR RENTS ON A REGULAR BASIS -- GET A FAIR RETURN BASED ON SOME FORMULA THAT CITY SET -- WE TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THAT GOVERNMENT CAN AND SHOULD PLAY SOME CONTROLS ON LOCAL PUBLIC UTILITIES ELECTRICITY GAS AND WATER -- AND HOUSING IS ALSO A BASIC NECESSITY SO IT'S TIME TO RESTORE THE ABILITY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO REGULATE RENTS SECOND. THE COSTA HAWKINS ACT PROHIBITS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM REGULATING RENTS ON RENTAL HOUSING THAT WAS BUILT AFTER. NINETEEN NINETY FIVE COSTA HAWKINS WAS PASSED TWENTY THREE YEARS AGO. BUT THE DATE FOR EXEMPTING NEW CONSTRUCTION SO CALLED NEW CONSTRUCTION HASN'T CHANGED SINCE THEN. BECAUSE THE COSTA HAWKINS IN LA -- ANY UNIT BUILDING AFTER NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT IS EXEMPT FROM ANY RIGHT REGULATIONS BUT THE MORTGAGES ON THESE OLDER HOUSING RENTAL HOUSING DEVELOPMENTSHAVE BEEN PAID OFF OR A SMALL PART. OF THE BUILDINGS OPERATING BUDGETS SO THERE ISN'T A SINGLE CITY IN THE UNITED STATES WHERE RENT CONTROL COVERS NEW CONSTRUCTION. EVERY CALIFORNIA CITY THAT ADOPTED SOME FORMER RENT CONTROL. PRIOR TO THE COSTA HAWKINS ACT. EXEMPTED NEW CONSTRUCTION EVEN WITHOUT THERE BEING A PRO NO PROHIBITION ON IT. CITY SHOULD BE ABLE TO ADOPT A SUNSET PROVISION SO THAT SAY TWENTY YEARS AFTER RENTAL BUILDING IS BUILT LOCAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD HAVE THE AUTHORITY. TO REGULATE RENTS. THIRD THE COSTA HAWKINS ACT TIES THE HANDS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM DEALING WITH WHAT I CALL THE BLACKSTONE PROBLEM. SINCE THE MORTGAGE CRISIS OF TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT LARGE WALL STREET FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS LIKE THE GLOBAL PRIVATE EQUITY FIRM BLACKSTONE OF GOBBLED UP MILLIONS OF SINGLE FOR A FORKLIFT SINGLE FAMILY HOMES. AND CALIFORNIA IS GROUND. ZERO IN THE WALL STREET ABSENTEE CORPORATE WHEN OR TREND. ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THE RENTAL UNITS IN CALIFORNIA. TWENTY TWO POINT TWO MILLION OUT OF SIX MY RENTAL UNITS ARE SINGLE FAMILY BUILDINGS. SO LOCAL JURISDICTION SHOULD BE ABLE TO REGULATE RENTS FOR A LARGE CORPORATE ABSENTEE LANDLORDS WITH LARGE INVENTORIES OF SINGLE FAMILY HOMES. WE GIVE YOU FIVE REASONS FOR REPEALING COSTA HAWKINS -- THE LA OH REPORT DOWNPLAYS THE POSITIVE ECONOMIC IMPACTS AND THE COST SAVINGS OF CITIES ADOPT STRONGER RENT CONTROL SO WHAT THE HIGHWAY WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE THE FIVE ABOUT REASONS TO REPEAL IT FIRST. RENT CONTROL IS GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY. IT WILL PUT MONEY BACK IN THE LOCAL ECONOMY -- IF UP MANY WORDS ARE OF LIMITED FROM EXCESSIVE RATE INCREASES TENANTS WILL HAVE MORE MONEY TO SPEND. THEY WILL SPEND ALMOST ALL OF THEIR MONEY IN THE LOCAL ECONOMY DOUBLE BOOST LOCAL BUSINESSES INCREASE LOCAL SALES TAXES. AND INCREASED JOBS FOR BUSINESSES TO PROSPER AS A RESULT OF THE ADDITIONAL CONSUMER DEMAND [inaudible] ALSO CALIFORNIA EMPLOYERS CANNOT THRIVE IF PEOPLE CAN'T FIND A PLACE TO LIVE CLOSE TO WORK. CALIFORNIA WORKERS ARE MOVING FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY FROM THEIR JOBS IT'S HARD TO ATTRACT PEOPLE TO COME TO CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF THE HIGH COST OF RENTAL AND HOME OWNERSHIP HOUSING FOR EXAMPLE I RECENTLY CONDUCTED. A SURVEY OF DISNEYLAND EMPLOYEES THAT IN ANAHEIM ON ALMOST ONE THIRD OF THEM COMMUTE MORE THAN TWO HOURS A DAY GETTING TO AND FROM WORK. THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE HIGH COST OF HOUSING IN ORANGE COUNTY SECOND REASON. DEVELOPERS MAY NOT REALIZE HOW RENT CONTROL ACTUALLY INCREASES THE DEMAND FOR NEW DEVELOPMENTS IF CITIES HAVE RENT CONTROL THE PROTECT TENANTS IN EXISTING BUILDINGS. THE YOU HAVE TO BUILD MORE FOR THE AFFLUENT TENANTS WHO WANT TO MOVE INTO THE AREA RENT CONTROL ENCOURAGES NEW CONSTRUCTION BY CHANNELING HIGHER INCOME WORKERS. INTO THE MARKET FOR NEWLY BUILT APARTMENTS RATHER THAN ALLOWING THEM TO DISPLACE THE SITTING TENANTS FROM EXISTING HOUSING THIRD. pRENT CONTROL WILL SAVE MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS WELL AS THE STATE GOVERNMENT A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY THAT THEY NOW SPEND ADDRESSING THE GROWING PROBLEM OF HOMELESSNESS. IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT IT IS LESS COSTLY TO PREVENT A PROBLEM THEN TO ADDRESS IT AFTER IT HAS BECOME A SERIOUS CRISIS. STATE COUNTY AND MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS SPEND A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FUNDING ON LAW ENFORCEMENT. EMERGENCY SHELTERS AND OTHER EFFORTS TO DEAL WITH HOMELESSNESS IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN LA COUNTY. CLOSE TO A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR CARING FOR AND MANAGING HOMELESS PEOPLE INCLUDING HEALTH CARE NEED SOCIAL SERVICES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. ZILLOW RECENTLY DID A STUDY THAT SHOWED THAT A 5% RENT INCREASE IN LA COUNTY CARTON ADDITIONAL TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE TO LOSE THEIR HOMES. SO BY REDUCING HOMELESSNESS RENT CONTROL REDUCE THE SIGNIFICANT COSTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT FOURTH APPEALING COSTA HAWKINS WOULD GIVE LOCAL GOVERNMENT THE ABILITY TO REDUCE A GREAT DEAL OF HUMAN SUFFERING RISING RENTS HAVE CAUSED WIDESPREAD EVICTION. DISPLACEMENT AND DISRUPTION OF FAMILIES WIVES AND THERE'S A LOT OF SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH THAT UNANIMOUSLY AGREES. THAT HOUSING INSECURITY AND INSTABILITY EVICTION AN INVOLUNTARY MOVING HAS SERIOUS AND HARMFUL PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH EFFECTS ON ADULTS AND CHILDREN ALIKE. CHILDREN WHO MOVE FREQUENTLY ACCUSE ME WHO MOVE FREQUENTLY DON'T DO AS WELL IN SCHOOL. HOUSING INTENSELY IN SECURITY AND STABILITY HURTS WORKERS PERFORMANCE ON THE JOB SO. A RECENT STUDY BY THREE ECONOMISTS AT STANFORD FOUND THAT RENT REGULATIONS IN SAN FRANCISCO ENABLE THOUSANDS OF LOWER INCOME TENANTS TO REMAIN IN THE CITY WOULD OTHERWISE. BEEN DISPLACED AND REDUCE THAT THE ALMOST POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS THAT COMES FROM BEING AFRAID OF BEING A VICTIM OR BEING EVICTED -- AND AND WINDING UP ON THE STREET OR NOT KNOWING WHERE YOU'RE GOING AND FINALLY. REPEALING COSTA HAWKINS IS ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL OF THE HEART COSTA HAWKINS ACT WAS REPEALED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS RE ABLE TO DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES WHAT KIND OF REGULATIONS IF ANY. TO ADOPT SO WHAT TALK ABOUT CHIU MYTHS ABOUT RENT CONTROL THAT THE LANDLORD Y. WE HAS CONTINUED. TO PERPETUATE. TO DISCREDIT RENT CONTROL FIRST THE IDEA THAT RENT CONTROL WILL HAVE A NEGATIVE FISCAL IMPACT ON CITIES IS VERY MISLEADING. THE SIMPLE PASSAGE OF THE BALLOT MEASURE TO REPEAL COSTA HAWKINS WILL HAVE NO PHYSICAL IN. IT ALL DEPENDS ON WHAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DO IF ANYTHING. ANY ANALYSIS OF THE FISCAL IMPACT ALSO HAS TO LOOK. AT THE RESULTING INCREASE IN SALES TAX REVENUES THE SAVINGS TO LOCAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT FROM THE REDUCE COST TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. AND THE COST OF ADDRESSING THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH CONSEQUENCES HOUSING INSECURITY INSTABILITY AND DISPLACEMENT AND SECOND. THERE'S A MYTH. THE WEEKEND QUICKLY BUILD OUR WAY OUT OF CALIFORNIA'S SEVERE HOUSING CRISIS EIGHT CD PROJECTS THAT THE STATE WILL NEED ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION NEW HOUSING UNITS TO MEET PROJECTED. POPULATION AND HOUSEHOLD GROWTH THAT'S MORE THAN TWICE THE PACE OF NEW CONSTRUCTION OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS. BUT EVEN THAT FIGURE IS MISLEADING BECAUSE IT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE NEED TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING CONCERNS OF THOSE WHO CAN'T AFFORD MARKET RENTS. SO EVEN IF WE MARSHALL THE POLITICAL WILL TO DO SO. CONSTRUCTING NEW HOUSING THAT WE NEED WILL TAKE DECADES AND ONLY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE PRACTICE OF RESTRICTIVE EXCLUSIONARY ZONING THAT LIMITS NEW HOUSING CONSTRUCTION AND IS THE PRIMARY CAUSE. OF THE HOUSING SHORTAGE. SO WE CAN'T WAIT UNTIL SUPPLY CATCHES UP. OR TRICKLES DOWN EXCESSIVE RENT INCREASES ARE EXTREMELY ARE CAUSING EXTREME HARDSHIP NOW ONLY RENT CONTROL CAN PROVIDE SOME IMMEDIATE RELIEF. ACROSS THE COUNTRY. ONE QUARTER OF ALL THE FAMILIES WHO WERE ELIGIBLE FOR SUBSIDIZED HOUSING ACCORDING TO HOOK ONLY ONE QUARTER RECEIVE ANY HOUSING SUBSIDY IT'S NOT AN ENTITLEMENT. SO EVEN IF WE HAD ENOUGH FEDERAL HOUSING VOUCHERS FOR EVERY FAMILY THAT'S ELIGIBLE FOR A VOUCHER WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH APARTMENTS FOR THEM TO RENT. IT'S LIKE GIVING PEOPLE FOOD STAMPS WHEN THE SUPERMARKET SHELVES ARE EMPTY EXCUSE ME I JUST WANT TO MENTION YOUR AT YOUR PRESENTATION TIME COLLECTIVELY ARE EGGMAN IN. NINETEEN I HAVE A LOT OF THEIR STUFF FOR THE A VITAL TO PRESENTERS. AS THE NATION WE NEED TO BUILD MORE HOUSING BUT WE NEED TO PRESERVE THE EXISTING SUPPLY OF HOUSING AND RENT CONTROL IS ONE WAY TO DO THAT THE LANDLORD LOBBY. HAS BEEN CRYING WOLF FOR DECADES. ABOUT HOUSING CONSTRUCT I RENT CONTROL AND IT'S TIME TO TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT RENT CONTROL IT'S NOT THE PANACEA BUT IT IS ONE SOLUTION THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO ADOPT THANK YOU. WHEN I TURN IT OVER? TO MR DAN CAL. SCOTT WOULD ISSUE [inaudible] THANK YOU. AQABA RESTORED MORNING GOOD MORNING -- SOME MEMBER CHIU SENATORS THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE OUT MY NAME IS DAN CALLED I AM IN MY SECOND TERM AYE AYES A MEMBER OF THE OAKLAND CITY COUNCIL REPRESENTING OPENS. FIRST COUNCIL DISTRICT AND AUTHOR OF OAKLAND'S TENANT PROTECTION ORDINANCE. WE CURRENTLY HAVE RENT CONTROL PROTECTIONS FOR OUR RESIDENTS ARE WHO ARE RENTERS IN OUR CITY OR I SHOULD I SAY. FOR MANY OF OUR RENTERS BUT NOT ALL OF THEM DUE TO THE COSTA HAWKINS LAW THAT PREVENTS US. FROM PROTECTING QUITE A LARGE NUMBER OF OUR TENANT RESIDENTS FROM THE VERY REAL REAL RISK OF DISPLACEMENT. WE EVEN STRENGTHEN THOSE LAWS LAWS LOCAL LAWS A COUPLE YEARS AGO HOWEVER ARE READY PROTECTIONS CAN ONLY APPLY TO RESIDENTS WHO LIVE IN HOUSING BUILT BEFORE NOT BEFORE. NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE AND OUR RESIDENTS I FAMILIES WHO RENT pINDIVIDUAL CONDOMINIUMS ARE SHUT OUT OF RENT PROTECTIONS BECAUSE THE COSTA HAWKINS LAW. PREVENTS LOCAL JURISDICTIONS FROM INCLUDING THOSE RENTAL UNITS IN OUR LOCAL ORDINANCES. RIGHT NOW OAKLAND GOING THROUGH A CONSTRUCTION BOOM AND THAT'S GREAT. FROM I TESTED FIFTEEN THOUSAND SEVENTEEN OAKLAND ISSUED BUILDING PERMITS FOR OVER SEVEN THOUSAND RESIDENTIAL UNITS AND SOME OF THOSE UNITS ARE BELOW MARKET AND THAT'S A GOOD THING. BY AS MUCH AS WE'RE TRYING AS MUCH AS WE'RE DOING -- THAT CANNOT POSSIBLY BE ENOUGH. LIKE MANY CITIES IN LIKE MANY SEASON CALIFORNIA OAKLAND IS STILL SUFFERING FROM A HOUSING CRISIS. OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS THE CITY OF OAKLAND PUBLISHED A HOUSING EQUITY ROAD MAP AND A FOLLOW UP OAKLAND ACTION AT HOME REPORT FROM THE MAYOR'S HOUSING CABINET WHICH I WAS HAPPY TO BE PART OF THESE THESE REPORTS CLEARLY SHOW. THAT OUR SOLUTIONS ARE NOT EITHER BUILD MORE HOUSING OR PROTECT MENTORS FROM DISPLACEMENT BUT RATHER THAT WE ABSOLUTELY MUST DO BOTH. AND WE NEED HELP. REPEALING COSTA HAWKINS WOULD GIVE US ONE MORE SIGNIFICANT TOOL TO PROTECT OUR RESIDENTS AND MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO WORK IN OUR CITY CAN LIVE IN OUR CITY. OAKLAND OPENS RENTS. ARE SOME OF THE MOST RAPIDLY INCREASING IN THE COUNTRY AS OF MAY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN JUST LAST MONTH. THE AVERAGE RENT FOR AN APARTMENT IN OAKLAND WAS TWO THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY EIGHT DOLLARS. THAT'S AN EIGHT POINT 6% INCREASE FROM THE PREVIOUS MONTH NOT THE PREVIOUS YEAR THE PREVIOUS MONTH. AT OAKLAND'S HOMELESS SITUATION LIKE MANY CITIES. HAS ALSO BEEN VERY CHALLENGING TO SAY THE LEAST ARE HOMELESS POPULATION. CLUES FORMER RENTERS IN OUR CITY NOW LIVING IN THEIR CARS OR ON THE STREET. MANY WHO WORK IN OAKLAND CAN'T AFFORD CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE IN OUR CITY. FOR EXAMPLE A FEW YEARS AGO A NEW ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER. WHO HAD BEEN WORKING AT A PUBLIC SCHOOL IN MY COUNCIL DISTRICT WANTED TO LIVE IN OR ADJACENT TO OUR CITY? BUT COULDN'T FIND ANY PLACE TO LIVE THAT THAT SHE COULD AFFORD. AFTER AWHILE SHE LEFT SHE GOT A TEACHING JOB SOMEWHERE ELSE AND WE'VE LOST. TOPNOTCH EDUCATOR BECAUSE OF OUR HOUSING CRISIS AND THE RENTS THE WAY THEY WERE [inaudible] AND ARE. SOME FOLKS COMMUTER OAKLAND FOR WORK DESPITE LIVING AS FAR AS AN HOUR OR MORE AWAY FROM OUR CITY. THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR FAMILIES IT'S NOT GOOD FOR OUR ENVIRONMENT. BUT WE ARE WORKING ON AND HELPING TO FINANCE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS PEOPLE ARE BEING PUSHED OUT OF THEIR HOMES TODAY THAT'S RIGHT PEEP. THE IN THIS INITIATIVE TO REPEAL COSTA HAWKINS WOULD GIVE US THE ELECTED LEADERS IN OAKLAND AND OVER A DOZEN A DOZEN OTHER CITIES THAT HAVE SOME SORT OF RENT CONTROL TODAY. ONE MORE CRITICAL TOOL. TO HELP THE MANY PEOPLE WHO WE WERE WE WERE WHO WE REPRESENT TO ALLOW THEM TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES. IN OAKLAND I COULD SEE SUPPORTING A ROLLING SYSTEM OBRZEG CONTROL FOR WHERE AFTER FOR EXAMPLE AFTER FIFTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS NEWER CONSTRUCTION WOULD EVENTUALLY FALL UNDER RENT CONTROL. I CAN'T TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED IN OAKLAND -- SHOULD THIS INITIATIVE PASS BUT I DO THINK I DO BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE THE OPTION TO MAKE OUR DECISION BASED ON WHAT WE FEEL IS BEST FOR OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR RESIDENTS THAT'S WHAT WE WERE ELECTED TO DO. I'M HERE ASKING VOTERS AND ASKING THE LEGISLATURE IF IT'S NOT TO LATE TO GIVE US THOSE TOOLS. EVEN AS WE BUILD NEW HOUSING. WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR EXISTING RENTERS FROM THE VERY REAL RISK OF DISPLACEMENT. I WAS ALSO ASKED TO NOTE. I BY MR ORSON AG RELY OUR WHO'S THE EXECUTIVE DRESSED DIRECTOR OF THE GREEN LINING INSTITUTE I WAS ASKED TO NOTE BY HIM DIRECTLY. TO LET YOU KNOW THAT HE AND HIS COLLEAGUES AT GREEN LINING SUPPORT ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS FOR RENTERS AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS BALLOT MEASURE. PASSED IN ORDER TO REPEAL COSTA HAWKINS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. IT YOU VERY MUCH AND THE FINAL SPEAKER IS -- MR BRENT TURNER AYE -- AYE WILL JUST NOTE AT THIS TIME YOU HAVE FIVE MORE MINUTES ON THE THIRTY AND I'M SORRY THAT YOU CAME AT THE END BUT THAT IS THAT. THANK TRIGGERED CHAIR CHIU -- SENATORS -- GOOD DAY MY NAME IS BRENT TURNER I'VE BEEN A REAL ESTATE -- I AM A REAL ESTATE BROKER IN SAN MATEO COUNTY I'VE BEEN IT IN REAL ESTATE AS A LICENSED AGENT SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY AND I'VE OWNED TURNER REAL ESTATE. SINCE TWO THOUSAND I HAVE A PROP FOR ME DOING BOTH RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE DIAMOND ECO BROKER U. S. GREEN BUILDING COUNCIL CERTIFIED. AND A GRADUATE OF THE REAL ESTATE INSTITUTE I TEACH REAL ESTATE AT THE COLLEGE LEVEL. IN MY PERSONAL TIME I'M A LANDLORD. AND I'VE OWNED UP TO EIGHT PROPERTIES IN MY PAST -- IN ALL MY YEARS IN THE INDUSTRY I'VE SEEN MANY BOOMS AND BUSTS IN THE HOUSING MARKET. FROM THE FALLOUT OF THE DOT COM BUBBLE. IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS TO THE GREAT RECESSION TO THE CURRENT MARKET. I'VE I'VE COME TO THE BELIEF THAT RENT CONTROL IS NOT ONLY THE MORAL THING TO DO IT'S ALSO THE SMART THING TO DO. ACOSTA HAWKINS IS A MAJOR THOUGH NOT THE ONLY CONTRIBUTOR TO THE HOUSING CRISIS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF LANDLORDS ARE ARE GOOD ACTORS BUT COSTA HAWKINS GIVES LATITUDE. TO THE BAD ACTORS TO ACT POORLY AND REPEALING IT WOULD GIVE LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES. THE AUTHORITY TERRAIN THE MEN AND MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES STRONGER. I HAVE SEEN SAN MATEO COUNTY. OVERRUN WITHOUT OF TOWN LANDLORDS AS OF LATE. THEY HAVE NO RELATIONSHIP TO THE COMMUNITY BUT THEY ARE IMPACTING THE COMMUNITY SEVERELY. I'VE SEEN NURSES FIREFIGHTERS TEACHERS SERVICE WORKERS AND THEIR CHILDREN RUN OUT OF TOWN BECAUSE THEY CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO KEEP UP WITH THE HIGH RENTS THAT ARE BEING PLACED ON THEM. THIS IS AN UNSUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEM THAT'S TO THE DETRIMENT OF EVERYONE. ALL IT TAKES IS ONE MARKET CRASH WHICH WE'RE GOING TO HAVE EVENTUALLY. THEN YOU WILL HAVE NOBODY LIVING IN THE COMMUNITY FOR EMERGENCIES TO WORK IN THE COMMUNITY TO TEACH OUR CHILDREN ACCEPT IRA. THAT WILL SINK THE VALUE OF OUR COMMUNITIES EVEN FURTHER HIGH RENTS CAN'T LAST FOREVERBUT THEY HAVE TERRIBLE CONSEQUENCES WHEN THEY'RE ENACTED. IN MY EXPERIENCE TOO MANY REAL ESTATE INVESTORS BUYING HOMES NOW ARE IN IT FOR THE SHORT TERM GAIN NOT FOR THE TRADITIONAL STABILITY. THAT PURCHASING HOUSING BRINGS. TRADITIONALLY INVEST INVESTORS ABOUT HOUSING BECAUSE IT'S A GOOD STABLE INVESTMENT. THEIR PROPERTY TAXES REMAIN STABLE BECAUSE OF PROPOSITION THIRTEEN AND IF THEY'RE IN DESIRABLE AREAS THEY WILL CONTINUE TO ATTRACT AND THAT'S FOR YEARS TO COME. REAL ESTATE INVESTORS WILL HAVE STABLE SOURCES OF INCOME. WHEN REAL ESTATE INVESTORS TALK ABOUT PAIN I THINK WE SHOULD NECESSARILY DIFFERENTIATE THE KIND OF PAIN THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT FROM THE PAIN OF PEOPLE? THAT ARE IN THE PROBLEMATIC SITUATION OF BEING THROWN INTO THE STREET. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH WANTING TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY BUT WHEN THAT DESIRE IMPACTS PEOPLE'S ABILITIES TO LIVE AND WORK IN A GEOGRAPHIC THAT'S ALREADY IN CRISIS WE HAVE A PROBLEM. REMEMBER THESE LANDLORDS THAT MAY COMPLAIN A ARE ABLE TO TEN THIRTY WHEN THEIR PROPERTIES INTO OTHER AREAS THAT ARE NOT SUFFERING IMMEDIATE CRISIS. THOUGH I AM PERSONALLY NOT IMPACTED BY RENT CONTROL AS THE OWNER OF MY PROPERTIES I DO KEEP MY RENT STABLE ON MY OWN PROPERTIES BECAUSE CHANGING TENANTS ALL THE TIME. AND PRICE GOUGING PEOPLE IS NOT MY IDEA OF GOOD BUSINESS. WHEN YOU HAVE TO SWITCH BETWEEN TENETS YOU TEND TO HAVE SOME DEAD TIME OR VACANCY TIME? THEN YOU HAVE TO TEND TO THE FIXES IT YOUR PREVIOUS TENANTS MAY NOT HAVE TOLD YOU ABOUT THEN ONCE YOU GET A NEW TENANT YOU'RE GUESSING IF THEY WILL BE A PROBLEM OR NOT. IN MY EXPERIENCE IT'S EASIER TO LOVE THE ONES YOU'RE WITH THEN REYES RANCH. AND CONTINUOUSLY GET A REVOLT. REPEALING COSTA HAWKINS SIMPLY TURNS POWER TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR THEM AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT HERE PRESERVING THE POWER OF COMMUNITIES THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. AND I THINK YOU WHEN THAT. THE COURT OF THE DAY LOVE THE ONES HERE WITH JUST WANT TO SAY THAT -- WITH THAT LET ME ASK US HUNDRED YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS TO THIS PANEL. OKAY GREAT THANK YOU I APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION -- I THINK YOU PRESENTED -- A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE AND I WILL EXCUSE YOU AT THIS TIME. AND WE WILL CALL UP THE PANEL -- OF MEMBERS OF THE OPPOSITION THANK YOU FOR JOINING US -- THE PANEL COLLECTIVELY HAVE THIRTY MINUTES AND I THINK WE'LL BE STARTING WITH MISS CARTON. THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN. UP MY NAME IS DEBORAH CARLSON I AM THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION WE REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY FIFTY THOUSAND RENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS AND MANAGERS WHO OPERATE. APPROXIMATELY TWO MILLION UNITS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS MORNING I WANT TO FOCUS ON THREE AREAS CONCERNING THE INITIATIVE. THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ACT. FIRST OF ALL THE WARNINGS THAT WE'VE RECEIVED FROM ECONOMISTS AND THE STATE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE ABOUT THE IMPOSITION OF STRICT RENT CONTROL. TO ALSO THAT THIS INITIATIVE WERE AND WHAT IT WILL DO. A WHEN IT COMES TO LAWSUITS AND THE COSTS ON THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND FINALLY THE INABILITY FOR STATE LAWMAKERS TO CORRECT ANY PROBLEMS THAT COME AS A RESULT. OF THE PASSAGE OF THIS INITIATIVE. SO FIRST THE WARNINGS. I THERE IS NOT ONE CREDIBLE ECONOMIST OR STUDY THAT HAS REPORTED THAT STRINGENT RENT CONTROL WILL HELP CALIFORNIA. IT WON'T HELP EMPLOYERS RECRUIT EMPLOYEES AND IT WON'T CREATE NEW. AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. ACCORDING TO THE LA SHOW AND OTHER STUDIES ON RENT CONTROL THEY STRONGLY SUGGEST. THAT THIS INITIATIVE WHICH INTENDS TO ELIMINATE THE STATE'S COSTA HAWKINS RENTAL HOUSING ACT WELL REDUCE THE EXISTING STOCK OF RENTAL HOUSING. WILL INCREASE RENTS IN NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES. WELL TURNED HOUSING OVER TO PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT IN NEED. IT WILL INCREASE BLIGHT AND HOMELESSNESS. UNDER STRICT FORMS OF RENT CONTROL THE STUDIES DEMONSTRATE THE PROPERTY OWNERS WILL CONVERT THEIR HOUSING TO OWNERSHIP HOUSING. CONDOMINIUMS AND TENDENCIES AND CARMEN. A STUDY OUT OF STANFORD UNIVERSITY FOUND THAT SAN FRANCISCO REDUCE TO SUPPLY. THE MINISTER COURTESY IN THIS HEARING ROOM. THE SAME COURTESY THAT EACH OF YOU WHO WOULD WANT TO SPEAK WOULD WANT TO RECEIVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SIR. I STUDY OUT OF STAMFORD FOUND THAT SAN FRANCISCO REDUCED ITS SUPPLY RENTAL HOUSING BY 15% AND EXPERIENCED A 25% REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF RENTERS LIVING IN RENT CONTROL UNITS TODAY RELATIVE TO NINETEEN NINETY FOUR LEVELS. AND A RECENT STUDY OUT OF UC BERKELEY THE TURN REPORT DEMONSTRATES THAT STRICT RENT CONTROL. WHICH SHOULD BECOME LEGAL UNDER THE ELIMINATION OF COSTA HAWKINS. COULD CONSTRAIN NEW HOUSING SUPPLY. REDUCE INVESTMENT IN HOUSING QUALITY. AND WILL LEAD TO THE REMOVAL OF THE EXISTING UNITS FROM THE MARKET. AND BECAUSE RATE CONTROL IS RARELY MEANS TESTED WE KNOW THAT THE BENEFITS DON'T COME TO THOSE WHO TRULY NEED IT. RENT CONTROL UNIT SHOULD BE RESERVED FOR THOSE IN MOST NEED. SO THAT WE DO NOT SEE DISPLACEMENT. UNFORTUNATELY THE INITIATIVE DOES NOTHING TO TARGET THIS POPULATION AND DOES NOTHING TO PROTECT THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE DESPERATE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND WHO ARE LEFT OUT IN THE COLD. THE TURNER REPORT SUGGESTS A NUMBER OF WAYS TO EXTEND MEANINGFUL PROTECTION TO RENTERS WITHOUT CONSTRAINING NEW SUPPLY. AS AN ORGANIZATION THAT REPRESENTS RENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS WE DO NOT WANT TO SEE RENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS GO OUT OF THE BUSINESS. BUT WHEN READ CONTROL BECOMES TOO EXTREME. WE WILL DEFEND THEIR RIGHT TO DO SO. IF THIS INITIATIVE PASSES ESPECIALLY FOR SINGLE FAMILY HOMES AND SMALLER BUILDINGS. SMALL OWNERS WHO REPRESENTED MODE MAJORITY OF THE HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA WILL CONVERT FOR WILL SELL THEIR HOMES OCCUPANTS OR UNFORTUNATELY TO AIRBNB SITUATIONS. WE'VE SEEN THIS IN STRICT RENT CONTROLLED A SITUATIONS. THERE ARE WEBSITES DEVOTED TO THIS AS YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF STATE BILLS THAT ATTEMPTED UNSUCCESSFULLY STOP OWNERS FROM LEAVING THE MARKET. THERE'S NO DOUBT WE ARE GOING TO SEE MORE OF THIS [inaudible] WE AGREE. CALIFORNIA'S HIGH COST OF LIVING HAS MADE IT DIFFICULT IN SOME PARTS OF THE STATE FOR EMPLOYERS TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN SKILLED WORKERS. THIS ALL CENTERS AROUND THE FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH HOUSING. NOT BECAUSE OF COSTA HAWKINS. WE'VE ALL SEEN NEWS REPORTS THAT TELL US THAT SOARING HOUSING COSTS HAVE LED TO THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LEAVING THE CALIFORNIA. THIS WILL CONTINUE EVEN IF THE INITIATIVE PASSES AND WHILE EXISTING TENANTS MAY EXPERIENCE LOWER RENTS. IT WILL BE HARDER TO FIND A VACANT UNIT FOR NEW EMPLOYEES AND STUDENTS. THE INITIATIVE DOES NOT ADDRESS OUR HOUSING PROBLEM IT POURS GASOLINE ON A HOUSING CRISIS AND WE BELIEVE MAKES IT WORSE. FINALLY THE PROPONENTS CITE THAT. THAT STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT RENT CONTROL COMMUNITIES. A CONSTRUCTION HAS CONTINUED I HAVE TO REINFORCE THE FACT THAT NEW CONSTRUCTION HAS CONTINUED BECAUSE COSTA HAWKINS HAS ENSURED THAT THOSE DEVELOPERS WILL RECEIVE IN BE EXEMPT FROM RENT CONTROL. THE INITIATIVE DOES NOT PROVIDE THOSE ASSURANCES. ON THE FRONT OF LITIGATION. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF WAYS IN WHICH THIS INITIATIVE WILL INCREASE LITIGATION AND COST TO THE STATE. SECTION TEN OF THE INITIATIVE PROVIDES THAT IF THE STATE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES FAILED TO TO A TO DEFEND THE INITIATIVE. PROPONENTS ARE AUTHORIZED TO INTERVENE IN ANY COURT ACTION CHALLENGING BUT ACT'S CONSTITUTIONALITY. THE PROPONENTS ATTORNEY'S FEES MUST BE SATISFIED PROMPTLY OUT OF THE FUNDS. A APPROPRIATED TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. THIS PROVISION WILL ADD LITIGATION COSTS IMPOSED BY THE INITIATIVE OR STATE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THE INITIATIVE PROVIDES THAT THE STATE MUST PAY THEIR COST WHETHER THEY WIN OR LOSE. THIS WAR KICK RECREATE A COTTAGE INDUSTRY FOR TRIAL LAWYERS TO LITIGATE EVEN IF THE LOCAL JURISDICTION HAS DECIDED. TO AND LITIGATION AND TO SETTLE. AND WHILE THIS INITIATIVE DOES ALLOW FOR A FAIR RETURN ON INVESTMENT IT FAILS TO DEFINE IT. BEFORE COSTA HAWKINS CAME INTO EFFECT THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF LAWSUITS ON THIS TOPIC. AFTER COSTA HAWKINS CAME INTO EFFECT THE LAWSUITS WERE ALL BUT ELIMINATED. BECAUSE IT GAVE TO LANDLORDS VACANCY DE CONTROL. THE LOW RANCID OWNERS WERE REQUIRED AYE TO CHARGE UNDER SOME EXTREME FORMS OF RENT CONTROL. ALSO GAVE THE THEM THE ABILITY TO INCREASE THEIR RENTS WHEN THERE WAS A TURNOVER INTENDANCY. WE WILL SEE LITIGATION CONTINUE AND PROBABLY INCREASED DRAMATICALLY AS A RESULT OF THIS. INITIATIVE AND OR STRICT FORMS OF RENT CONTROL WHICH HAVE BEEN PROMISED TO US. BY LOCAL COMMUNITIES NOW FINALLY THIS MEASURE PREVENTS THE LEGISLATURE FROM ADDRESSING ANY PROBLEMS CREATED BY THIS INITIATIVE. THE LANGUAGE PROVIDES THE LEGISLATURE MAY ONLY AMEND THIS ACT TO FURTHER THE PURPOSES OF THE BILL. IN EACH HOUSE TWO THIRDS OF THE LEGISLATURE MUST. PASS THAT IN THE GOVERNOR MUST SIGN IT NO STATUTE RESTRICTING OR ELIMINATING THE POWERS OF THE OF THIS INITIATIVE MAY BE PASSED UNLESS BY THE VOTERS. WHICH AS YOU ALL KNOW MEANS IT AFFECTS UNLESS ITS EFFECT IT'S EFFECTIVE UNLESS APPROVED BY THE MAJORITY OF THE VOTERS. ALL OF YOU KNOW. AS OUTLINED BY THE LA OPEN AND THE STUDIES. IF THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES COME TO FRUITION. YOU CAN DO NOTHING ABOUT IT THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION AND MANY OTHERS LIKE THE CALIFORNIA STATE CONFERENCE OF THE N. DOUBLE ACP. THE AMERICAN LEGION DEPARTMENT OF CALIFORNIA. MILITARY OFFICERS OF AMERICA. AND THAT'S DEPARTMENT OF CALIFORNIA AMERICAN GI FORM OF CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL HOUSING FINANCE AGENCIES AND THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HOUSING AUTHORITIES WILL OPPOSE THE INITIATIVE IN NOVEMBER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LISTENING. IF YOU VERY MUCH OF I WANT. TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE'VE BEEN JOINED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER RICHARD BLOOM FROM SANTA MONICA AND WITHOUT LIKE TO MOVE TO THE NEXT BAKER. US AND EUROPE. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK BEFORE YOU TODAY MY NAME IS CYNTHIA RIGHT I'M THE SENIOR DIRECTOR OF ACQUISITIONS WORKING EXCLUSIVELY AT FPI MANAGEMENT SINCE. NINETEEN NINETY APPLYING MANAGEMENT IS THE LARGEST AFFORDABLE AND CONVENTIONAL APARTMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANY IN CALIFORNIA WE MANAGE SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND UNITS. THE FLAWED INITIATIVE WILL HAVE A DEVASTATING IMPACT ON NEW RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION. THE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE FUTURE OF COSTA HAWKINS HAS ALREADY PUT ON HOLD A NUMBER OF NEW HOUSING PROJECTS. THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON FOR YEARS WITH THE ADDITIONAL COSTS RELATING TO LAND AND CONSTRUCTION THESE PROJECTS WILL SIMPLY NOT PENCIL IF SUBJECTED TO EXTREME AND PERMANENT RENT CONTROL. IN ADDITION MANY DEVELOPERS WHILE HOLDING OFF ON DEVELOPMENT IN CALIFORNIA ARE RAMPING UP DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN NEIGHBORING STATES. MANY LARGE DEVELOPERS TEND TO HAVE A NATIONAL FOOTPRINT ALREADY. IF YOU HAVE THE SAME INVESTMENT DOLLARS AND NO BUILDING PROJECTS IN NEIGHBORING STATES IS MORE PREDICTABLE. AND CARRIES IT LAST RISK. EXCUSE ME THERE ARE RULES IN THE CHAMBER ABOUT NOT HAVING SIGNS BECAUSE IT DOES BLOCK THE VIEW OF OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND HOW THEY ARE ABLE. TO NOT SEE THE PROCEEDINGS SO I WILL ASK YOU NOT TO DISPLAY SIGNS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BACK TO YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU WE STOP THE CLOCK FOR YOU. THANK YOU SIR IF YOU HAVE THE SAME INVESTMENT DOLLARS AND NO BUILDING PROJECTS IN NEIGHBORING STATES IS MORE PREDICTABLE AND CARRIES LESS RISK THINK CLEARLY YOU WILL DEVELOP AND OTHER STATES. I RECENTLY TOWARD A NEW TWO HUNDRED UNIT COMMUNITY IN A NEIGHBORING STATE THAT CAME OUT OF THE GROUND IN TWO YEARS. THIS TWO HUNDRED UNIT COMMUNITY WHICH DOES HAVE AN AFFORDABLE COMPONENT. BY CAL IS BEING PURCHASED BY CALIFORNIA BASED COMPANY TAKING INVESTMENT DOLLARS OUT OF THE STATE IN CALIFORNIA IT TAKES FIVE TO TEN YEARS TO GET PROJECTS OUT OF THE GROUND. AS THERE'S A SHORTAGE OF AFFORDABLE AND AVAILABLE HOUSING IN THE BAY AREA THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY HAS NOW BECOME THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SOLUTION FOR THE BAY AREA. WITH THE INCREASE OF RENTERS I'M SEEING VACANCY RATES DECREASE AND A NEED FOR MORE HOUSING IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF EXTREME RENT CONTROL AND THE BAY AREA WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON THESE VALLEY TOWNS. THE VALLEY IS ALREADY THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SOLUTION FOR THE BAY AREA AS WITNESSED BY THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO HAD WEST OVER THE ALTAMONT IN DETAIL PASSES TO WORK. UNFORTUNATELY THE IMPACT OF THE FLAWED INITIATIVE HAS A CHILLING EFFECT OF A HOUSING FREEZE SOME OF MY CLIENTS ARE PUTTING ON HOLD THEIR DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN THE VALLEY. PENDING THE OUTCOME OF THE INITIATIVE. I HAVE HONOR CLIENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT FIND THEMSELVES IN SIMILAR SITUATIONS EITHER SLOWING DOWN PROJECTS OR RECONSIDERING THEM IN THE LIGHT OF THE UNCERTAINTY AROUND COSTA HAWKINS. AT THE SAME TIME MANY BUILDINGS NEED RENOVATION IN ORDER TO KEEP THEM RELEVANT FUNCTIONAL AND IN THE CURRENT HOUSING STOCK. INSTEAD OF PLANNING FOR RENOVATIONS CLIENTS ARE LOOKING AT CONVERSIONS AND SALE OF THEIR PROPERTIES. THESE RENOVATIONS WOULD HAVE PROVIDED LOCAL JOBS TAX REVENUE DOLLARS AND WOULD HELP PRESERVE AND STRENGTHEN THE COMMUNITIES LOCAL ECONOMY. AS A COMPANY WE CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THE AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES THAT CALIFORNIANS FACE OUR COMPANY AND PARTNERS WANT TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN DO BUSINESS IN THE STATE. BUT THIS WILL HAVE A DEVASTATING IMPACT IN THE LONG RUN IT WILL LEAD TO SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER NEW AND AFFORDABLE RENTAL UNITS IN CALIFORNIA. WE NEED TO FOCUS ON POLICIES THAT HELPS LIKE THE LOCAL HOUSING BOND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LET'S GO [inaudible] TO THANK YOU. IT'S GOT A MISTER GREASY. HOW GOOD MORNING -- MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ARE GOOD AFTERNOON RATHER -- CREAM GREASY ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS AS OPPOSED TO THE INITIATIVE BEING DISCUSSED BEFORE YOU TODAY. SEE OUR CO SPONSORED THE COSTA HAWKINS RENTAL HOUSING ACT IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE WHICH IS A BIPARTISAN COMPROMISE PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN RESPONSE TO THE PROLIFERATION OF EXTREME RENT CONTROL. THIS INITIATIVE AMONG OTHER THINGS SEEKS TO REPEAL THE ENTIRETY OF THAT ACT. THE PROPONENTS OF THIS INITIATIVE A PROFFER THE ARGUMENT THAT THE REPEAL OF COSTA HAWKINS WILL HELP ALLEVIATE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS. WE STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH THIS CONTENTION AND TO THE CONTRARY BELIEVE THAT THE REPEAL OF COSTA HAWKINS WILL MAKE THE STATE'S HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS EVEN WORSE [inaudible] SPECIFICALLY. IF COST AUDIENCES REPEAL THIS RESULT IN THE PASSAGE OF THIS INITIATIVE CLOSE TO TWO POINT TWO MILLION SINGLE FAMILY RENTALS AND APPROXIMATELY. HUNDRED EIGHTY FOR APPROXIMATELY HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND MULTI FAMILY UNITS BUILT AFTER. NINETEEN NINETY FIVE THROUGHOUT THE STATE COULD BE SUBJECTED TO UNREAD UNBRIDLED RENT CONTROL POLICIES. IF THIS INITIATIVE IS PASSED IN NOVEMBER APPROXIMATELY THREE MILLION UNITS ABOUT 23% OF THE HOUSING STOCK IN CALIFORNIA. COULD BE SUBJECTED TO LIMIT WAS RENT CONTROL. SUBJECTING CLOSE TO A QUARTER OF THE HOUSING STOCK IN THE STATE TO EXTREME RENT CONTROL WOULD HAVE DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES. MOST NOTABLY IT WOULD DRASTICALLY REDUCED AMOUNT OF SINGLE FAMILY RENTALS THESE RENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS A VAST MAJORITY OF WHOM ARE SMALL MOM AND POP OPERATORS. WOULD BE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR PROPERTIES UNDER THE DIRE FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS IMPOSED BY EXTREME RENT CONTROL. AS A RESULT THE SINGLE FAMILY RENTALS TO BE SOLD AND CONVERTED TO OWNER OCCUPIED PROPERTIES FURTHER EXACERBATING THE STATE'S HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS. IN TERMS OF THE IMPACTS OF EXTREME RENT CONTROL ON NEW CONSTRUCTION A RECENT STUDY FROM RECORDS UNIVERSITY INCLUDED A CROSS SECTIONAL ANALYSIS OF NEW JERSEY METROS WITHIN WITHOUT RENT CONTROL. AND FOUND THAT PER CAPITA CONSTRUCTION FALLS BY ABOUT 25% IN JURISDICTIONS WITH RENT CONTROL HOLDING ALL OTHER VARIABLES CONSTANT. APPLYING THAT RESULT CALIFORNIA. INSTRUCTION WOULD DECREASE BY ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND UNITS PER YEAR AND WOULD LEAD TO A CUMULATIVE DEFICIT OF WELL OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITS BY. TWENTY THIRTY ADDITIONALLY THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF EXTREME RENT CONTROL CAN BE SEEN FROM LOOKING AT SUCH RENT CONTROL AS IT EXISTED PRIOR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF COSTA HAWKINS. IN BERKELEY DURING THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES EXTREME RENT CONTROL WAS IMPOSED ON SINGLE FAMILY RENTALS IN NEW CONSTRUCTION. AS A RESULT BERKELEY REPORTED THAT ABOUT THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED UNITS THAT WERE RENTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY WERE NOT RENTED A DECADE LATER IN PART BECAUSE TWELVE HUNDRED SINGLE FAMILY RENTALS AND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MULTI FAMILY UNITS WERE CONVERTED OWNER OCCUPANCY. THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF EXTREME RENT CONTROL OF NOT JUST EXCLUSIVE TO CALIFORNIA. THE CITY OF CAMBRIDG MASSACHUSETTS FOUND THAT EXTREME RENT CONTROL IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES RESULTED IN ROUGHLY HOUSING STOCK. BEING CONVERTED TO NON CONTROLLED CONDOMINIUMS. IN RESPONSE TO THIS AND OTHER FINDINGS CAMBRIDGE EVENTUALLY VOTED TO ELIMINATE EXTREME RENT CONTROL IN. NINETEEN NINETY FOUR GIVEN ALL THIS EXTREME RENT CONTROL WHICH WOULD RETURN TO CALIFORNIA THIS INITIATIVE PASSES. CLEARLY NOT THE SOLUTION THE STATE'S HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS. RATHER THE SOLUTION IS MORE SUPPLY. THERE'S SIMPLY NO GETTING AROUND IT CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO SUFFER FROM A STAGGERING AND CHRONIC HOUSING SUPPLY SHORTAGE. THE STATE IS NOT SIMPLY BUILDING ENOUGH HOUSING UNITS FOR EVERYONE. THE LACK OF ADEQUATE SUPPLY HAS LED TO SKYROCKETING PRICES. CLEARLY SUBSTANTIALLY MORE HOUSING NEEDS TO BE BUILT. HERE'S SOME TROUBLING FACTS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THREE POINT FOUR MILLION ADDITIONAL HOUSING UNITS ARE NEEDED BY. TWENTY THIRTY ABOUT HALF THE NATIONAL HOUSING UNITS IN CALIFORNIA. TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT SAYS THAT THE STATE MUST BUILD HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND UNITS EACH YEAR TO KEEP PACE WITH POPULATION GROWTH. THE STATE IS CURRENTLY ONLY BUILDING HALF THAT. THREE THE STATE'S MEDIAN HOME PRICE IN MAY OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN OF MORE THAN DOUBLE THE NATION'S MEDIAN PRICE. AVERAGE HOME RENTALS ARE 50% HIGHER THAN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. AND LASTLY THE STATE'S HOMEOWNERSHIP RATE OF FIFTY FIVE POINT 1% IS THE SECOND LOWEST AMONG ALL STATES IN THE U. S.. CA ARE PROPOSES THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING TO HELP INCREASE THE STATE'S HOUSING SUPPLY. ONE STREAMLINE THE PERMITTING PROCESS. TO FIX SECRETIVE FASTRACK AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THREE REQUIRE LOCAL GOVERNMENT IMPLEMENT HOUSING NEEDS NUMBERS. FOR FUND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND LASTLY DEFEAT PROPOSED LEGISLATION THAT DISCOURAGES RENTAL HOUSING CONSTRUCTION. IN CONCLUSION WELL THIS INITIATIVE WOULD REPEAL THE COSTA HAWKINS RENTAL HOUSING ACT IN ITS ENTIRETY. IT WILL ONLY SERVE TO FURTHER EXACERBATE THE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS BY DECREASING EXISTING RENTAL HOUSING STOCK AND STIFLING NEW INVESTMENT RENTAL HOUSING. SEE OUR POSES THIS INITIATIVE AND INSTEAD LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THIS LEGISLATURE A PROPOSALS THAT WILL BOLSTER THE STATE'S HOUSING SUPPLY. I THINK YOU AGAIN MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK BEFORE YOU TODAY THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THE FINAL WITNESS -- MISTER GUMBO. THANK YOU NOT USUALLY ASKED TO BAT CLEAN UP BUT I'LL DO MY BEST SO -- MY NAME IS FIRST OF ALL I THINK ABOUT THE THE CHAIRS AND THE COMMISSION. COME A COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU ARE SUCH A CRITICAL ISSUE. MY NAME IS JOHN GAMBLE AND I HAVE. BEEN A COMMUNITY ADVOCATE AND LEADER FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS ON IT. I HAVE BEEN -- THE CO FOUNDER AND THE DIRECTOR OF TWO OF THE MAJOR OF MINORITY A ADVOCATE ORGANIZATIONS THE GREEN LINING INSTITUTE AND LATINO ISSUES FORM. I WAS A MENTOR IN THE TEACHER FAR. OF ORSON AGAIN ARE WHO IS A NEW CHIEF OF DIRECTOR OF GREEN LINING INSTITUTE BUT I DIDN'T TEACH HIM EVERYTHING YET HOT. I'M REPRESENTING TODAY HAVE THE TWO HUNDRED THE TWO HUNDRED IS A RELATIVELY NEW ORGANIZATION ON IT WAS -- FOUNDED BY. THAT SOME OF THE MOST REVERED AND SUCCESSFUL CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS IN THE STATE. INCLUDING GEORGE BEING HE WAS PRESIDENT OF THE URBAN LEAGUE'S. CRUZ REYNOSO FORMER SUPREME COURT JUSTICE HERMAN GUY A CALLS A FOUNDER OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF LA RAZA. TYPE IN NAME FROM THE A KOREAN COMMUNITY AND OTHERS HAN IT. ALL OF US [inaudible] OUR VOLUNTEERS AND CONTRARY TO SOME OF THE ACCUSATIONS THAT I'VE HEARD. WE DO NOT. A UX GET ANY PAY. ANNE AND ORGANIZATION ON WE CAME TOGETHER FOR ONE PURPOSE AND HOPEFULLY WILL BE ABLE TO WORK OURSELVES OUT OF A JOB. THE ONE PURPOSE IS TO ADDRESS. FIRST OF ALL OF US WERE RETIRED. WE CAME TOGETHER BECAUSE OF THE GROWING WEALTH GAP AFFECTING THE MINORITY COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA. THE INSIDIOUS AND GROWING WEALTH GAP. AND WE FEEL THAT THE METHOD. OF ADDRESSING THIS WEALTH GAP. IS WILL DO IS TO USE THE SAME AVENUES THAT CREATED THE GREAT WHITE MIDDLE CLASS SCIENCE COUNTRY AND THAT IS HOMEOWNERSHIP. IN OUR EXPERIENCE. ALLTHESE YEARS WE HAVE SEEN GOOD AND BAD INITIATIVES. INITIATIVES THAT SOMETIMES HELP OUR COMMUNITY AND SOMETIMES HEARD OUR COMMUNITY. THIS IS NOT ONE OF THE ONES THAT HELP. WE KNOW THAT TO HAVE IT IS PROMOTED BY SOME OF THE BEST PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY WHO HAVE BEEN DOING GOD'S WORK. BUT IT'S UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. OUR REVERSE OF WHAT ITS INTENT TO HIS IT WILL INCREASE THE HOUSING CRISIS INSTEAD OF DEEP DECREASING MET. THE MINORITY COMMUNITY IS ALREADY. SO FAR BEHIND IN WEALTH IN IN HOMEOWNERSHIP BECAUSE OF THE PAST DISCRIMINATIONS OF REDLINING [inaudible] PREDATORY LENDING. AND THE FAILURE OF REGULATORY AGENCIES TO COULD TO REGULATE THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ON IT. NOT ONLY WERE WE STARTING TO CLOSE THAT WEALTH GAP. FROM A NINETEEN SEVENTY ON TO TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT BECAUSE OF THE ACTIVITIES OF GREAT CIVIL RIGHTS ERA. OUR LEADERS ON IT. BUT ALONG COMES A GREAT RECESSION. AND THIS FROM GREAT RECESSION. PUT OUR COMMUNITY BACK. THIRTY YEARS IN WEALTH IN THREE YEARS WE LOST THE WEALTH GAINED IN THREE YEARS [inaudible] TODAY. THE MINORITY COMMUNITY HOMEOWNERSHIP IN CALIFORNIA IS ABOUT 50% OF WHITE. IT'S MOST ASTOUNDING THOUGH IS A WELL. QUITE WEALTHY SIXTEEN TIMES GREATER THAN MINORITY WELL FUNDS. AND LOT OF THIS IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE HIGH COST OF HOUSING IN IN. IN THE STATE. THIS INITIATIVE IS WELL INTENDED BUT WHAT IT WILL DO. IS A WORLDLY. CREATE THE FEAR. OF INVESTORS AND LANDLORDS AND THIS FEAR WILL INHIBIT THEM FROM MAINTAINING THEIR PROPERTIES AND CREATING NEW PROPERTIES TO ADD TO THE SUPPLY. YOU'VE HEARD OF ALL THE SPEAKERS TALK TODAY THAT THE MAIN PROBLEM THE HOUSING CRISIS THERE'S A LACK OF SUPPLY THE LACK OF SUPPLY KEEPS. YEAH I THE HOUSE THE HIGH COST OF HOUSING THAT THE HIGH COST OF HOUSING IMPACTS DISPROPORTIONATELY. MINORITY THE MINORITY COMMUNITY ON IT. WHAT WE NEED A TIME -- PROPONENT OF SOME KIND OF RENT STABILIZATION. BUT THIS PARTICULAR INITIATIVE DOES NOT PROMOTE THAT. IT CREATES A DEMOCRATIZATION IF YOU WILL OF DIFFERENT RANT STE ACROSS THE STATE THAT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND LOCAL COMMISSIONS. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND LOCAL COMMISSIONS HAVE NOT BEEN GOOD TO THE MINORITY COMMUNITY. THEY HAVE NOT IMPLEMENTED THE HOUSING ELEMENT LAWS THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE SO FAR BEHIND IN IN HOUSING. WHAT WILL HAPPEN WITH THIS INITIATIVE GIVING MORE POWER TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND -- COMMISSIONS. IT WILL ALLOW THEM. TWO BECAUSE OF FEAR OF THE WEALTHY A RESIDENTS. ALLOW HIM TO USE RENT CONTROL AS ANOTHER FORM OF NAME BE IT'S ON WE DON'T NEED THAT TON. NOT ONLY THAT IT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE GENTRIFICATION WHICH WE'RE TRYING TO STOP -- DOT NET ON NOT GOOD USES. WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE? IN THIS STATE RIGHT NOW. IS WERE EATING OUR SEED CORN. WE ARE FAILING TO INVEST IN THE FUTURE OF THE PEOPLE THAT WE ARE GOING TO NEED. TODAY [inaudible] MULLIN MEALS MINORITIES AND STUDENTS WILL BE COUNTED UPON. PAY. NOT OWN TO TO PAY THEIR HERE EXORBITANT STUDENT DEBT THAT THEY HAVE. THEY'LL BE ASKED TO THE BE TRYING TO FEED THEIR S. SUPPORT NEW FAMILIES. KEEP A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD. AND WE ARE ASKING THEM. TO TAKE ON THE BURDEN OF SUPPORT. OF THE OF OUR ELDERLY OR THAT THE ENTITLEMENTS WE HAVE BECOME ACCUSTOMED. TO THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO DO THIS IT'S GOING TO CREATE. IT'S GOING TO CREATE A RACIAL SLUR -- TENSION MORE THAN WE ALREADY HAVE BANKS DUE TO MR TRUMP EDNA AND OTHERS ON IT. IT WILL ALSOCREATE A TENSION BETWEEN. YOUNG FAMILIES AND OLDER FAMILIES YOUNG FAMILIES FIELDING THE BURDEN OF HAVING TO TO SUPPORT THE OLD OLDER FAMILIES WHO DID NOT INVEST IN THEM SO THEY COULD. HAVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE THE ISSUE OF OF RENT CONTROL IN A WAY ON A STATEWIDE BASIS SO THE LOCAL -- TOLD THIS NOW THAT THE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT OUR COMMUNITIES. THIS IS NOT THE ANSWER. WE NEED TO GET TOGETHER ALL THE SITE OF PEOPLE EVERYBODY. GET TOGETHER AND COME UP WITH AN ANSWER THAT'S A LONG RANGE THIS IS TOO SHORT RANGE THAT HELPS TOO FEW PEOPLE. FOR SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME WE NEED A LONGER PLAN. THANK YOU. YOU KNOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE ASKED CENTER ANY QUESTIONS CENTER. I'M JUST RESERVE IF ONE OF YOU CAN TELL ME WHAT WHAT IS A FAIR RATE OF RETURN. BY WAY OF THIS INITIATIVE IT'S NOT DEFINED -- SO WE HAD A LOT OF LAWSUITS PRIOR TO COSTA HAWKINS BECAUSE IT WAS DEFINED SO LANDLORDS WOULD GO TO THEIR RENT BOARDS AND ASK FOR AN INCREASE IN RED -- MAYBE BECAUSE THEY HAD TO PUT ON A NEW ROOF FOR MAYBE THERE WERE LOCAL REQUIREMENTS -- THERE WERE ALSO LAWSUITS WHEN THEY DIDN'T GET. A I AUTHORIZED INCREASE -- HERE WE AGAIN DON'T HAVE A DEFINITION OF FAIR RATE OF RETURN SO WE BELIEVE NOW BECAUSE OWNERS. CAN'T RECEIVE A RENT INCREASE POTENTIALLY UPON VACANCY. IF THEY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IMPOSE VACANCY CONTROL WE'RE GONNA SEE MORE REQUESTS -- FOR A QUOTE FAIR RATE OF RETURN AGAIN UNDEFINED. AND IF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT DECIDES TO SETTLE AND AUTHORIZE. A RATE INCREASE. PROPONENTS CAN NOW CHALLENGE THAT RENT INCREASE AND THE STATE WILL BE A FORCED TO PAY FOR THOSE TYPES OF LITIGATION THAT WE WILL SEE COMING FORWARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NO SIR ANDERSON WELCOME ALRIGHT JUST TO FOLLOW UP. WHEN YOU SAY THEY'LL BE FORCED TO PAY THE LEGAL FEES? DO YOU MEAN OF THE DEFENDANTS OR DO YOU MEAN. OF THE PEOPLE CORD CHAIRMAN JAMES. WHY WOULD THEY BE ALL THE LEGAL FEES ARE JUST VERY LEGAL FEES? THE INITIATIVE IS VERY CLEAR -- THAT IF -- PROPONENTS FOR EXAM ARE AND HAPPY WITH A LOCAL DECISION. THEY CAN CHALLENGE THE INITIATIVE OR THEY CAN CHALLENGE I SHOULD SAY THE LOCAL. ACTION. AND THIS INITIATIVE REQUIRES. THAT THEIR ATTORNEYS FEES BE PAID WHETHER THEY WIN OR LOSE. OUT OF THE APPROPRIATIONS THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. SO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL PAY. THOSE LEGAL FEES ACCORDING TO THIS INITIATIVE. SO IF I WAS AMBITIOUS ATTORNEY. AND I COULD FIND MULTIPLE LAWSUITS I WIN WITH OUR WHEN I LOSE SECRETARY ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU.
