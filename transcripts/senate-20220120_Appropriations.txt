IT WILL THERE ARE AUTHORS AMENDMENTS TO MODIFY THE AMOUNT OF DISTILLED SPIRITS PERMIT HOLDERS CAN SHIP TO RESIDENTS REQUIRE OUT OF STATE BEER MANUFACTURERS TO COMPLY WITH THE STATE BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM AND CLARIFY THE DISTILLED SPIRITS CAN BE. DELIVERED BY COMMON CARRIERS AND THEY'RE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TO AMEND THE LIMIT THE OVERALL AMOUNT CERTAIN DISTILLERS CAN SHIP PER YEAR. OUR MOTION. ON A MOTION BY MISTER WHITE CAL SKI- WE HAVE A COMMENT BY MISS TOM WATER. IS IT OKAY TO ASK A QUESTION. SURE THE AUTHORS NOT HERE OKAY- WELL I JUST HAD A QUESTION IF THIS WAS IT SAID- DID TO MODIFY THE AMOUNT OF DISTILLED SPIRITS. THE AMOUNT IS YET- OMITTING THE OVERALL AMOUNT DISTILLERS CAN SHIP MARC WILL GIVE YOU THAT. YOUR LAWLER. OKAY CAN WE HAVE THE COMMENTS AT A PRESS PUBLICLY SALUTE BECAUSE I HAVE THE SAME QUESTION THANK YOU ALL RIGHT. SO THE QUESTION IS- FOR THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WHAT IS THE AMOUNT THAT IS THE LIMIT. SO FOR A COMMITTEE MOMENTS THE BILL WOULD BE AMENDED FOR LARGE DISTILLED SPIRITS SHIPPER PERMIT HOLDERS THAT PRODUCE MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY GALLONS OF DISTILLED SPIRITS PER CALENDAR YEAR. THAT NAY IF YOU'RE UNDER FIFTY THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND SORRY. SO FOR THOSE LARGE DISTILLERS THE AMOUNT THAT THEY CAN SHIP PER CALENDAR YEAR UNDER A DIRECT SHIPPER PERMIT IS A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND GALLONS THOSE WHO. PRODUCE MORE THAN A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR GALLONS THEY CAN SHIP UP TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND GALLONS PER YEAR RIGHT TO THE COMMITTEE PUT A EXTRA HAIR CUT ON THE LARGE DISTILLERS. ABOUT WHAT THE COMMITTEES BY BUT WITH THE AUTHORED FOR PROPOSING WITH THE OTHER AMENDMENTS I GUESS IT. OKAY HOLD ON THIS CONGRESS FIRST-AND I'M SORRY YOU MISTER JONES. BUT THE LARGE DISTILLERIES ARE STILL INCLUDED THEY ARE WITH IT WITH A HAIR CUT AND IS IT SILENCE ON CRAFT BEER. DISTILLERY'S THERE NO MA'AM IT'S RECALL MOMENTS OR RELATIVE TO THE BEER. NO COMMITMENTS HELLO COMMITTEE MEMONS. AND IS THE COMMON CARRIER JUST A COMMON CARRIER BECAUSE THERE IS A COMMON CARRIER WITH EMPLOYEES COMMON CARRIER. THE BEST PART OF THE COMMITTEE AS PART OF THE AUTHORS AMENDMENTS. NUMBER OKAY THANK YOU. OKAY MISTER JONES. BACK ON THE LIMITS- THE LARGE PRODUCERS HERE YOU'RE SAYING A HUNDRED TWO THOUSAND GALLONS PER YEAR AND INTO THE STATE BUT IS THERE ANY IS THERE A LIMIT PER CUSTOMER OR PER HOUSEHOLD OR- THAT'S NOT ADDRESSED IN THE COMMITTEE MEMBER THAT SOMETIMES A LIMIT ON THE PERMIT HOLDER FOR. CAN YOU SHARE IS A SUBSCRIPTION REQUIREMENT AS YET THEY HAVE TO HAVE A DIRECT SHIPPER PERMIT SO IT'S UNDER THAT PERMIT OKAY THE LIMIT IS A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND MILES- THANK YOU AND I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW I'M- IN MY DISTRICT I'M HEARING FROM BOTH SIDES OF THIS ISSUE BECAUSE I'VE GOT. YOU KNOW SOME OF THE MAJOR CRAFT BREWERS ARE IN MY DISTRICT AND SOME OF THE CRAFT DISTILLERS ARE IN MY DISTRICT AND THEN THE- THE RETAILERS ASSOCIATION IS HEADQUARTERED IN MY DISTRICT SO- I KNOW THAT THE RETAILERS STILL HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL- I'VE BEEN TALKING TO BOTH. THE CO AUTHORS- AND SO I THINK WE'RE GONNA. ON A DIFFERENT VEHICLE HELP THEM BE ON TO SOMETHING FOR THE RETAILERS. SO I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY- AND- YOU KNOW HOPE FOR POSITIVE CONVERSATIONS GOING FORWARD REGARDING THE RETAILERS WITH. OBVIOUSLY THE GEO COMMITTEE IN THE CHAIR AND THE AND THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL THANK YOU. RIGHT JUST TO CLARIFY THERE IS A REQUEST NECESSITY TO HAVE A SUBSCRIPTION WITH THE LARGE DISTILLERS AND THERE IS A LIMIT- SO THOSE ARE PART OF THE AUTHORS AMENDMENTS SELF. AND MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THAT ATKINS RIGHT THOUGHT OKAY. YES BUT SHOULD BE I COULD BE CONFUSED BUT THE AMENDMENTS NGO OR THE ANALYSIS IN GEO ALSO SAID THAT THIS CREATES A CRAFT DISTILLERS LICENSE WHICH AMONG OTHER THINGS AUTHORIZES THE LICENSEES TO PRODUCE UP TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND GALLONS SO HOW IS THAT DIFFERENT FROM THE LATEST AMENDMENT. THIS AMENDMENT IS ONLY DEALING WITH THE LARGE DISTILLERS DOES DOES IT PRODUCE OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND GALLONS PER YEAR IT WE BROUGHT THEM DOWN TO MEET WITH THE- OTHER DISTRICTS TO MEET THAT LANGUAGE IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY. FOR THE LARGE DISTILLERS. RIGHT BUT THIS ONE SEEMED TO BE SILENT ON THE SIZE OF THE DISTILLER SO I'M LIKE I SAID THIS AMENDMENT THIS AMENDMENT IS SPECIFIC TO THE LARGE TO HELP RIGHT WHO WHO PRODUCED THE OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND. ALL RIGHT WE HAVE A MOTION FOR MISTER WHAT KOWSKI. OF MR SECRETARY HOPE MISTER BRADFORD AS A STAND UP I'M SORRY MISTER BRADFORD AND USED. THE HAND. THING TO PLEASE GO AHEAD.

WHAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO HELP BECAUSE YOU STARTED OUT.
