ALTHOUGH HIV AND AIDS IMPACT EVERY COMMUNITY. EVERY COMMUNITY THE BLACK COMMUNITY HAS BEEN IMPACTED EXPRESSLY. AND HIT HARD BY THIS DISEASE THE BLACK COMMUNITY MAKE UP 13% OF THE U. S. POPULAR POPULATION BUT ACCOUNTS 4403% OF THE NEW. HIV DIAGNOSIS A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES CONTRIBUTE TO THIS EPIDEMIC IN MY COMMUNITY. THIS INCLUDES HIGH POVERTY. LACK OF ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE. LACK. OF AWARENESS OF HIV STATUS EGGMAN ASSOCIATED WITH THIS DISEASE AS THE CHAIR OF THE PICTURE DISEASES IN HIGH RISK DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. I AM COMMITTED TO RAISING AWARENESS AND WORKING ON LEGISLATION THAT WILL ADDRESS THIS CRISIS. AND AS A POINT OF SPECIAL PRIVILEGE. I NEVER WANTED TO BE IN THIS SPACE [inaudible] SUCH.

AND AT SIX YEARS OLD. LITTLE ROCK LOST HIS FATHER. DO TO COMPLICATIONS OF AIDS. AND THEN SHORTLY THERE AFTER SIX MONTHS OR SO LOST HIS MOTHER. AT SIX YEARS OLD LOSING BOTH PARENTS. TO AIDS. SO WHAT THIS SPACE. EVEN THOSE UNCOMFORTABLE BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT I FIND MYSELF FIGHTING FOR EACH AND EVERY DAY TO MAKING SURE THAT NO OF THE FAMILY NO ONE IN CALIFORNIA HAS TO DIE WITH AIDS. SO THAT'S THE REASON WHY FIGHT AND I WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT IN THIS SPACE. UNTIL THERE'S NO MORE REASON TO FIGHT. THE THEME FOR THIS RESOLUTION. STAY THE COURSE THE FIGHT IS NOT OVER. SO I URGE. THAT WE COME TOGETHER TO STAY THE COURSE. AND WE FIGHT TO GETTING TO ZERO NEW INFECTIOUS CASES IN CALIFORNIA. MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I VOTE ON HR. TWELVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER GIBSON. DR WEBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. AYE TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF HR TWELVE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS. WE IN TOTAL SUPPORT OF RAISING THE ISSUE AND MAKING IT A MAJOR CONCERN. YOU A NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS DIED. HE WAS A YOUNG MAN WHO I'VE HEARD SAN DIEGO STATE ONE OF THE MOST VIVACIOUS INDIVIDUAL YOU WOULD KNOW AND SOME OF YOU WHO TENANTS AND EAGLES DON'T KNOW DR DANI SCARBOROUGH. IT WAS AT THE HEIGHT OF THE AIDS. EPIDEMIC. AND HE WAS. ASHAMED EMBARRASSED. TRIED NOT TO LET FOLKS KNOW WE HAD IT BUT IN THE END DANNY WAS A GODPARENT. TO MY KIDS PASSED AWAY. AND TO THIS DAY WE STILL REMEMBER DANNY AND THE AND THE ENERGY HE HAD IN HIS ABILITY TO TRANSFORM CLASSROOMS AND EVENTS INTO A MAJOR THINGS HE'D HAVE YOUNG FOOTBALL PLAYERS WALKING DOWN THE HALL. QUOTING OR FELLOW. AND BECAUSE HE WAS SUCH A DYNAMIC INSTRUCTIONS AND WE MISS HIM IMMENSELY. SO IN. TWO THOUSAND THREE I TRAVEL TO MY FIRST TRIP TO SOUTH AFRICA. AND IT WAS THE WORK WITH LOVE LIFE WHICH WAS AN AIDS PROJECT. AND I HAD A CHANCE TO GO TO THE VILLAGES AND TO SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING AT THE HEIGHT OF THE AIDS PROJECT AIDS EPIDEMIC. AND I SAW HOW COMMUNITIES ARE GRAPPLING WITH THIS WHOLE ISSUE WITH MORE MYTHS AND FACTS. AND WILL BE LEAVING THAT IF THEY HAVE SEX WITH A VIRGIN THEY WOULD GET RID OF AIDS AND SO WE HAVE THE RAPING OF A LOT OF CHILDREN. AND EVEN THE RAPING OF NEWBORNS. FORTUNATELY FOR US THIS GOVERNMENT STARTED PEPFAR IN SOUTH AFRICA. UNDER GEORGE BUSH. AND IN AT THREE TO FOUR YEAR PERIOD ME GOING TO SOUTH AFRICA EVERY YEAR WORKING ON VARIOUS PROJECTS. WE SAW DRAMATIC CHANGE AND A TURN AROUND THAT WAS AMAZING IN SOUTH AFRICA. IN TERMS OF STOPPING THE INFECTIONS SAVING LIVES PREVENTING THE TRANSFERENCE OF TO THE DISEASE TO THE INFANTS BECAUSE OF LEARNING HOW TO DELIVER BABIES IN DIFFERENT WAYS. AND SO AS A RESULT WE SAW WHAT THE UNITED STATES CAN DO. WHEN HE PUTS HIS FOCUS ON? WE SAW WHAT IT'S DONE WHEN WHEN MAGIC JOHNSON TO ANNOUNCE THAT HE HAD AIDS. HOW THE FOCUS OF OF RESEARCH AND MEDICAL CARE AND EVERYTHING FOCUS SO THE NOW AS A SOCIETY? WE DON'T LIVE UNDER THE SHADOW OF AIDS AND SOME OF YOU OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER HOW HORRIBLE IT WAS WHAT I FEARED WAS BECAUSE IT TRULY WAS A DEFINITE STATEMENT THAT YOU GOT IT. WHAT THIS SAYS TO ME VERY CLEARLY THAT WOULD WANT ADMIN SAID ABOUT EDUCATION? THAT WE KNOW EVERYTHING WE NEED TO KNOW A OBJECT. WHAT WE LACK IS THE WILL? WE LACK THE WILL. AND IT IS SHAMEFUL THAT IN THIS COUNTRY AT THIS TIME. AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN AND WOMEN. ARE STILL BEING DIAGNOSED AT A HIGHER RATE THAN ANY OTHER GROUP. AND IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH DO WE HAVE THE MONEY IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WOULD DO WE HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE. DO WE HAVE THE CARE WILL BE SHOULD HAVE THE PASSION AND COULD AND CARE. FOR BUT IT LACKS THE WILL. AND MANY OF THESE FOLKS ARE SHAMED THEY REMIND ME OF WHAT I WOULD TO GOD TO TAKE MONEY. TO AN AIDS PROJECT I HAD TO MEET THEM IN A BACK ROOM AT AT THE PEACE CORPS BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT ANYBODY TO SEE THEM GETTING THIS MONEY. BECAUSE THEY THEY WERE SO ASHAMED IN THE VILLAGES THEY KNEW THAT IF SOMEBODY TO THEY HAD AIDS TO BE OSTRACIZED. THAT STILL EXISTS TODAY IN AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE NATION. WE HAVE TO PUT A FOCUS ON THIS. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD BECAUSE WHILE WE CAN CELEBRATE THE WONDERS OF MEDICINE AND WHAT WE CAN DO ALL AROUND THE WORLD WHERE THIS DEALING WITH AIDS. OR ANY OTHER KIND OF DISEASE TO FOCUS ON THOSE WHO LIVE HERE. WHO IS STILL UNDER THE SHADOW WHO ARE DYING AT ALARMING RATES WHO TRANSFERRING THE DISEASE TO OTHERS AND WHO LIVE IN THE SHADOW OF SHAME? I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOU I VOTE FOR THIS RESOLUTION AND THAT IT IMPACTS OUR BUDGET. AND OUR POLICIES IN THE STATE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER MISTER GLORIA. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER -- TRY TO MAKE IT HAPPEN NOT A FOLLOWING MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO HER COMMENTS ARE STERN PROFOUND IT'S DIFFICULT TO ADD TO THEM. ARE I SIMPLY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA. LEGISLATIVE LGBT CAUCUS IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE CALIFORNIA BLACK LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM CARSON A JUST SET SIGNAL OUR SUPPORT FOR THIS RESOLUTION. IN I RECOGNIZE THAT THESE RESOLUTION SOMETIMES FEEL -- BUT THEY'RE NOT THEY DON'T DO A LOT. BUT I THINK THAT -- MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO'S COMMENTS RECOGNIZING WHAT HER FRIEND FELT FELT AND DOT WITH -- OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO SADLY STILL VERY MUCH THE CASE TODAY. AND SO WHAT MAY SEEM. UNNECESSARY TO TALK ABOUT THIS ISSUE WE KNOW -- THAT THE AFRICAN AMERICAN HE LIVES IN THE INTERSECTIONS OF A LOT OF A DESPERATE TREATMENT. AND WHETHER IT'S RACIAL OR ECONOMIC A GENDER ORIENTATION THIS COMMUNITY IS DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY HIV AND SIMILE IS DISPROPORTIONATELY NOT IMPACTED BY THE END INNOVATIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS OF CON. OBVIOUSLY I KNOW A LOT OF FOLKS WHO HAVE DEALT WITH THIS DISEASE. FOLKS WHO'D NOW OUR LIVING OF QUITE HEALTHFULLY OTHER FOLKS THAT ARE PROTECTED BECAUSE THE RESEARCH THAT QUITE FRANKLY COMES OUT OF MY ASSEMBLY DISTRICT -- THE WORLD THE NEW DATE IT'S A NEW WORLD WHEN IT COMES HIV INFECTIONS AND YET THAT HAS NOT PENETRATED EVERY COMMUNITY AND WE LOOK AT NEW INFECTION RATES ACROSS THIS COUNTRY WE UNDERSTAND IT SEE THEM FALLING IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES. AND YET CONTINUE PERSISTENTLY HIGH IN OTHER IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY IS ALSO TRUE IN THE LATINO COMMUNITY AND COURSE NOW JUDY COMMUNITY THIS CONTINUES TO BE A FUN OF MY CONCERN. SO OF MEMBERS EITHER THIS RESOLUTION DOES HAVE POWER BECAUSE WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE PEOPLE STILL STAND IN SILENCE AND ARE NOT INFORMED OF MEDICATIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE THE COULD PREVENT INFECTIONS. MEDICATIONS THAT COULD EXTEND AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE WHEN WE KNOW THAT FOLKS WILL NOT STEP OUT OF THE CLOSET BECAUSE IT'S TOO HARD IN THAT MAY ACTUALLY CAN SIGN INTO A SITUATION WHERE THEY EVEN HIGHLY MORE VULNERABLE TO IN HIV INFECTION. THEN WE MUST VOTE WE MUST BRING UP THIS RESOLUTION WE MUST TALK ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THESE WORDS ARE AND FACT POWERFUL AND THEY PENETRATE INTO OUR COMMUNITIES AND THEY MAY PREVENT AN INFECTION THEY MAY GET SOMEONE TO GET INTO. CARE AND PREVENT THEIR ABILITY TO SPREAD THE DISEASE IT MAY ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO SAVE A LIFE SO I THINK THIS IS VERY POWERFUL I THINK THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT I THINK MY COLLEAGUE FROM CARSON. BUT NOT TO SHARE HIS PERSONAL EXPERIENCES BEFORE BRINGING THIS RESOLUTION BEFORE US. WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY BEFORE TOO MANY COMMUNITIES IN A PARTICULAR IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN UNITY WE HAVE STILL SO MUCH FURTHER TO GO SO AGAIN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE LGBT CAUCUS WE STAND AGAIN IN STRONG SOLIDARITY. WITH OUR WITH THE BLACK CAUCUS AND WITH OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM CARSON AND ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TO SPEAK OUT AND GIVE VOICE TO PEOPLE WHO'VE OFTEN FEEL VOICELESS. TO OPEN THE DOORS TO DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE ALL TOO OFTEN CLOSE INTO IMPORTANTLY TO FINALLY BE A COMMUNITY THAT WILL END THE SPREAD OF HIV. IT IS MEDICALLY IN TECHNICALLY POSSIBLE WE JUST MUST HAVE THE WILL TO DO IT I HOPE THEY WILL ALL HOLD OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE IN THE WEEKS AND MONTHS AHEAD TO SUPPORT LEGISLATION THAT WOULD DO EXACTLY THAT.

A JURIST IN CALIFORNIA IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE BY JERRY BROWN. JERRY BROWN WHO WHO LOVES HIS LATIN. AND I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU A LATIN EXPRESSION [inaudible] LOCKS MENTORS [inaudible] LOCKS ORBUS. AND I WILL SAY THIS PHRASE. RELATES TO ALICE LIDDELL'S LIFE IN A VERY DIRECT WAY. THE OPPORTUNITY SHE ENCOUNTERED. RELEASED THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF OUR LIFE. LOOKS MANTIS LUXOR BREAST MEANS LIGHT OF THE MIND. LIGHT OF THE WORLD. IS A REMINDER THAT IDEAS. ARE THE THING WHICH CHANGE LIVES. CHANGE HUMAN LIFE. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALICE LYTLE. LIFE [inaudible] YOU SEE. THE CONSEQUENCE OF IDEAS THAT. OUR IMPACTFUL ACROSS CENTURIES. EVEN TODAY ARE ENJOYED HAVING LITTLE JOE JOE -- WICKS ON THE FLOOR WITH US. ALICE LIABLE AS A JURIST IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY WITH VERY LONG CALLS WITH JURORS TO FRIEND OF MINE. OPEN LOCK CASITA. TO PROVIDE A SHELTER FOR PARENTS WERE GOING TO BE IN COURT TO BRING THEIR CHILDREN. AND TO BE CARED FOR WHEN OTHER PROCEEDINGS WERE GOING ON WHICH IS ITSELF A NOTABLE IDEA. THAT YOU WOULD WELCOME CHILDREN IN THE SEAT OF GOVERNMENT AND PROVIDE FOR THEM. ARM BUT ARE MUCH LARGER WAY LOCKS MENTIS LUXOR WRIST PLAYS OUT. I WILL TELL YOU. ALICE LYELL'S PERRANCE SHE WAS THE EIGHT CHILD OF TEN WERE FROM THE SOUTH. WHEN SHE WAS BORN SHE WAS IN NEW IN NEWARK NEW JERSEY? HER FAMILY HAD LEFT THE SOUTH. AND MOVED TO NEW YORK CITY. TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF FREE PUBLIC pPROSPECTS FOR THEIR CHILDREN. WHICH IS A CONVERSATION AS FRESH. AS OUR CURRENT NEW SESSION WE HAVE A GOVERNOR TALKING ABOUT IMPROVING ACCESS TO EDUCATION. SO NOW SLIDE WE SEE SOMEONE'S LIFE WAS TOUCH. WHY ACCESS TO EDUCATION? WHICH WAS PROVIDED BY POLICY MAKERS. THAT IDEA IN IMPROVING EDUCATION IS NOT AMERICAN ID IT STARTED IN FRANCE. IN FRANCE THE FRENCH ESTABLISHED LIKE COALS NORMAL LIKE COAL SUPER YOUR THESE WERE TEACHER TRAINING COLLEGES. THIS IDEA CAME TO THIS COUNTRY FIRST IN MASSACHUSETTS THE CITY UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK A STEP SE LE COAL NOR MALL OR NORMAL UNIVERSITY. TO TRAIN WOMEN. FOR TEACHING. AND IN AN ERA WHEN. SCHOOLS PLAYED FAVORITES BASED UPON RACE AND RELIGION AND THOSE SORTS OF THINGS. ALTHOUGH AS MANY DECADES SERVICE SHE BEGAN SCHOOL WHAT BECAME THE HUNTER COLLEGE. HER SCHOOL FROM ITS FOUNDING. HAD THIS VERY POWERFUL IDEA. THAT ANY QUALIFIED WOMAN WAS ELIGIBLE TO BE THEIR IRRESPECTIVE OF RACE RELIGION. ECONOMICS [inaudible] ARM. AND HER FIRST PRESIDENT HAD THIS AS A PART F HIS DNA THIS WAS THE EMPHASIS INSTITUTION WHEN SHE GRADUATED IN NINETEEN SIXTY ONE SHE WAS NOT A TEACHER. SHE WAS TRAINED AS A IN THE HEALTH FIELD. AND SHE ENDED UP COMING. TO UC SAN FRANCISCO. WHERE SHE WORKED IN THE CHILD? OF PEDIATRIC CARDIOLOGY YOUR BUT SHE WAS THERE IN THE SIXTIES. AND UPON THE ASSASSINATION OF MARTIN LUTHER KING. THIS WOMAN WHO GOT A FREE PUBLIC EDUCATION TO SCHOOL READ DOWN FOR ITS ACCESS. TO EDUCATION WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE OR OTHER SORTS OF THINGS. DECIDED SHE NEEDED TO BE A PART OF THIS MOVEMENT. SO SHE WENT TK HASTINGS LAW SCHOOL GRADUATED WENT TO WORK AT THE JERRY BROWN ADMINISTRATIONS LEGAL ANALYST.

AND A VERY DIFFERENT HER ENTIRE FAMILY THE LYTLE FAMILY IS A WELL KNOWN FAMILY IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF THE INVESTMENT THE PARENTS MADE IN AND AND THEIR CHILDREN AND MAKING SURE THE CHILDREN WORK. UPSTANDING CITIZENS AND HARD WORKING AND MADE A DIFFERENCE EVERYWHERE THEY WENT. I MET AT ALICE THROUGH HER BROTHER SEE SALIVA WHO'S A CONCERT PIANIST AND EVENTUALLY BECAME A A DEAN AND A VICE PRESIDENT AND YOU SEE A STATE. ALICE WAS CAREER WAS ONE OF TREMENDOUS SERVICE AS THEY TALKED ABOUT. HOW SHE CAME TO BE A A SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE AND AND WORKING VERY HARD IN SACRAMENTO IN THE MUNICIPAL COURT? NEVER AFRAID OF CONTROVERSY ALWAYS LOOKING FORWARD ALWAYS DETERMINED TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. WHEN SHE STARTED THE LOCK A SEAT AT WAS TALKED ABOUT IT WAS THE HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL PEOPLE DID NOT WANT CHILDREN IN COURT ROOMS THEY DID NOT WANT TO SEE YOUNG CHILDREN? RUNNING AROUND THE COURT ROOM SO SHE OPENED UP A WAITING ROOM FOR THEM FOR THE CHILDREN AND IT OF COURSE IT WAS HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL WHY SHOULD WE ACCOMMODATE THESE CHILDREN -- FOR WHETHER PARENTS ARE IN COURT AND SHE RECOGNIZE THAT THIS WAS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT PART IN EXTENSION OF JUSTICE FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS WERE WAITING FOR THEIR CASES. AS A RESULT NOW WE HAVE WAITING FOR CHILDREN THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF HER SENSITIVITY TO THAT ISSUE. SHE CARED DEEPLY ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE SO MUCH SO THAT SHE RALLIED TO VARIOUS GROUPS FOR TEENAGERS TO ADVOCATE FOR T. THOSE WHO ARE PREGNANT IN THE VARIOUS BIRTHING PROJECTS IN THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. THE SENSITIZER COURT TO THE CHAT MAKE SURE THAT OUR NATION HAD SOME SOME SENSE OF COMPASSION FOR THEM. SHE WAS A CHAMPION AND EVERYTHING THAT WE TALKED ABOUT SHE WAS DEALT WITH HEALTH ISSUES OF TEENS OF MAKING SURE THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHERS AND WHY THEY NEED TO BE HEALTHY. AND HOW THEY REALLY WERE THE FIRST TEACHER OF CHILDREN TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THEIR LIVES. THE LIFE LYTLE FAMILY IS A VERY WELL KNOWN FAMILY IN ALICE LEADS THAT FAMILY IN MANY WAYS BECAUSE THEY REVIEW THEIR SISTER BECAUSE SHE WAS SUCH AN ADVOCATE. SHE HAD BEGUN HER LIFE THINKING THAT SHE WOULD GOING TO PEDIATRICS AND BECOME A DOCTOR. WITH THE ASSASSINATION OF DR KING SHE REALIZED A REAL PASSION WITH SOCIAL JUSTICE. THAT SHE NEEDED TO GO IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION THAN MEDICINE AND THAT'S WHEN SHE DECIDED TO GO TO LAW SCHOOL. AND BECOME A JURIST SHE WAS AMAZING IF YOU EVER MET HER SHE WAS QUIET YET POWERFUL SHE FACED A LOT OF CHALLENGES IN HER LIFE BEING THE FIRST OF SO MANY THINGS. BEING RAISED IN HARLEM COMING OUT OF THE SOUTH IN GOING IN LIVING IN HARLEM WITH AT THE TIME AND SHE LIVED THERE WAS A VERY DIFFICULT TIME TO LIVE IN HARLEM BECAUSE THERE WAS LOTS OF A CRIME IN ACTIVITIES THAT OCCURRED. AND YET FOR HER HER FAMILY TOOK FROM HARLEM THE BEST THAT IT HAD. EDUCATION HUNTERS COLLEGE IT TOOK THE MUSIC INDUSTRY FROM HER BROTHER WHO BECAME A CONCERT PIANIST THEY TOOK THE BEST OUT OF HARLEM BECAUSE THEY SAW ALSO MUCH GOOD IN HARLEM THAT COULD THAT COULD HAPPEN FOR THEM AS THEY CAME OUT OF THE SOUTH. WHEN THEY DID THE SAME THING WHEN THEY CAME TO CALIFORNIA EVERYWHERE ALICE WENT SHE CHANGED THE ENVIRONMENT THAT WAS THERE? IT'S AMAZING THAT HER LIFE CIRCLED AROUND MINE IN SO MANY WAYS FROM THE TIME I WAS A YOUNG PROFESSOR AT SAN DIEGO STATE. TO EVEN WITH MY BILL AB NINE FIVE THREE THE APPOINTED TO THAT WHEN I SAW HER NAME ON THAT I KNEW THAT WHAT WOULD COME OUT OF THAT COMMITTEE WOULD BE A QUALITY WOULD BE SENSITIVE WOULD BE CARING.
