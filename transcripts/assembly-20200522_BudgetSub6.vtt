00:38:00.277 --> 00:38:02.179
FEDERAL ASSISTANCE THAT THERE

00:38:02.246 --> 00:38:03.714
IS A PROCESS TO BE ABLE TO

00:38:03.781 --> 00:38:05.916

LEGISLATURE IS INCORPORATED

00:38:15.926 --> 00:38:17.561
INTO THIS PROCESS I CAN ONLY

00:38:17.628 --> 00:38:19.964
SPEAK. FOR MYSELF. QUITE OFTEN

00:38:20.031 --> 00:38:22.166
LIKE THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC.

00:38:22.233 --> 00:38:23.601
I HAD TO WATCH THE GOVERNOR'S

00:38:23.668 --> 00:38:25.603
NOON PRESS CONFERENCE TO KEEP

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:27.438
UP TO DATE WITH INFORMATION-

00:38:27.505 --> 00:38:29.607

00:38:37.114 --> 00:38:39.216
WITH THE LEGISLATURE AS A

00:38:39.283 --> 00:38:40.851
WHOLE. ON NOT JUST MYSELF

00:38:40.918 --> 00:38:43.120
INDIVIDUALLY BUT WITHIN. BODY

00:38:43.187 --> 00:38:45.022
TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE PART OF

00:38:45.089 --> 00:38:47.725
THIS A STATES PROCESS AS WE

00:38:47.792 --> 00:38:49.694

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:52.163
PANDEMIC. IN IN. LOT LAST I

00:38:52.229 --> 00:38:54.198
THINK WE DO NEED TO FIGURE OUT

00:38:54.265 --> 00:38:56.000
AND WE WILL BE HAVING THIS

00:38:56.067 --> 00:38:58.235
DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT TO DO IN

APRIL TWENTIETH WE CAME BACK

00:39:03.808 --> 00:39:05.276
FOR THE FIRST TIME. ABOUT THE

00:39:05.342 --> 00:39:07.411
CONSTANT USE OF THE JAIL B. C.

00:39:07.478 --> 00:39:09.613
LETTERS. NOW THAT WE ARE HERE

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:13.451
AND BACK IN SEC WE BELIEVE OUR

00:39:13.517 --> 00:39:15.219
I BOUGHT TO SEE I BELIEVE. THAT

00:39:15.286 --> 00:39:17.121
WE SHOULD NOT BE USING THOSE

00:39:17.188 --> 00:39:19.123
JAIL BC LETTERS FOR NEW

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:21.158
APPROPRIATION. THAT WE HAVE A

00:39:21.225 --> 00:39:24.695
BUDGET PROCESS WE- DEMONSTRATED

00:39:24.762 --> 00:39:26.397
VERY QUICKLY THE DAY THAT WE

00:39:26.464 --> 00:39:28.866
RECESSED HOW FAST WE ACT. THE

00:39:28.933 --> 00:39:30.201
GOVERNOR FORTY THAT HE NEEDED

00:39:30.267 --> 00:39:32.069
WE DID OUR PART BUT I DON'T

00:39:32.136 --> 00:39:33.738
BELIEVE THAT IT'S BEEN A TWO

00:39:33.804 --> 00:39:34.672
WAY STREET IN TERMS OF

00:39:34.739 --> 00:39:36.941

00:39:37.007 --> 00:39:38.776

00:39:43.347 --> 00:39:45.883
IN CORPORATE. AND IT AGAIN JUST

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:46.550
TO REITERATE I THINK THE

00:39:46.617 --> 00:39:47.585
GOVERNOR'S DONE A GREAT JOB IS

00:39:47.651 --> 00:39:50.387
TEAMS AT A GREAT JOB AND I WERE

00:39:50.454 --> 00:39:51.789
HERE AT THIS POINT WHERE. ALL

00:39:51.856 --> 00:39:54.692
WE CAN START RE OPENING SIR

00:39:54.759 --> 00:39:55.259
PARTS OF OUR ECONOMY I THINK

00:39:55.326 --> 00:39:56.427
IT'S- BUT BUT I THINK THE

00:39:56.494 --> 00:39:58.362
OVERALL QUESTION. HOW IS THIS

00:39:58.429 --> 00:40:01.665
DIFFERENT. THAN MANY OF THE

00:40:01.732 --> 00:40:04.401
OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES THAT

00:40:04.468 --> 00:40:07.004
WE FACE TODAY. I DON'T JUST

00:40:07.071 --> 00:40:08.339
GIVE YOU TWO TWO PARTICULAR

00:40:08.405 --> 00:40:10.107
STOCKTON TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE

00:40:10.174 --> 00:40:13.043
TWO LARGEST CAUSES OF DEATH IN

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:15.112
TERMS OF PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES

00:40:15.179 --> 00:40:17.381
ONE WAS HEART DISEASE AND WE

00:40:17.448 --> 00:40:19.683
HAD SIXTY TWO THOUSAND DEATHS

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:22.186
IN HEART DISEASE AND TWENTY

00:40:22.253 --> 00:40:25.222
SEVENTEEN. WE HAD FIFTY NINE.

00:40:25.289 --> 00:40:26.690
THOUSAND DEATH. BUT THE CAUSE

00:40:26.757 --> 00:40:28.959
OF CANCER IN THAT YEAR OF

00:40:29.026 --> 00:40:31.629
TWENTY SEVENTEEN. YEP WE DON'T

00:40:31.695 --> 00:40:33.531
HAVE A STATE OF EMERGENCY. ON

00:40:33.597 --> 00:40:35.266
THOSE DISEASES THE GOVERNOR

00:40:35.332 --> 00:40:36.667
DOES NOT HAVE COMPLETE

00:40:36.734 --> 00:40:38.469
AUTHORITY TO DO WHATEVER HE

00:40:38.536 --> 00:40:41.438
WANTS TO FIGHT THOSE. DISEASES

00:40:41.505 --> 00:40:43.240
AND OUT WHILE THE PUBLIC IS

00:40:43.307 --> 00:40:45.609
EDUCATED ABOUT WHAT THEY THEY

00:40:45.676 --> 00:40:48.212
CAN AND THEY SHOULD DO WE HAVE

00:40:48.279 --> 00:40:51.315
NOT TAKEN. MEASURES FROM AN

00:40:51.382 --> 00:40:53.484
OVERALL STATE STANDPOINT TO

00:40:56.187 --> 00:40:57.588
DISEASES WITH THE SAME LEVEL OF

00:40:57.655 --> 00:40:59.156
FERVOR THAT WE HAVE WITH

00:40:59.223 --> 00:41:01.358

00:41:05.296 --> 00:41:06.997
WE HAVE. BEEN ON IS ACTUALLY

00:41:07.064 --> 00:41:09.366

00:41:09.433 --> 00:41:11.769
HAVE A COURSE WHERE THE PUBLIC.

00:41:11.836 --> 00:41:13.671

00:52:05.121 --> 00:52:06.723
COULD COME THROUGH TO STATE IN

00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:07.858
YOU KNOW THE COMING WEEKS FOR

00:52:07.924 --> 00:52:09.659
THE COMING MONTHS AND THIS

00:52:09.726 --> 00:52:11.728
AGAIN ALLOWS THE ADMINISTRATION

00:52:11.795 --> 00:52:13.663
TO ALLOCATE THOSE FUNDS EITHER

00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:15.031
FOR BUDGETARY RELIEF TO REPLACE

00:52:15.098 --> 00:52:15.966
EXISTING GENERAL FUND

00:52:16.032 --> 00:52:18.034
EXPENDITURES OR FOR YOU KNOW

00:52:18.101 --> 00:52:19.503
NEW PURPOSES DEPENDING ON

00:52:19.569 --> 00:52:22.305
WHAT'S ALLOWABLE IN- IN THE

00:52:22.372 --> 00:52:25.575
FEDERAL LEGISLATION. THEY HAD

00:52:25.642 --> 00:52:27.110
OUT NOTES THAT- NEITHER OF

00:52:27.177 --> 00:52:29.546
THESE REQUIRE NOTIFICATION TO

00:52:29.613 --> 00:52:30.814
THE LEGISLATURE ACTUALLY THAT

00:52:30.881 --> 00:52:32.716
HAS CHANGED- OR AT LEAST OUR

00:52:32.782 --> 00:52:33.884
UNDERSTANDING OF THAT HAS

00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:35.418
CHANGED- WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE

00:52:35.485 --> 00:52:36.887
ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING NEW

00:52:36.953 --> 00:52:38.088
CONTROL SECTION LANGUAGE THAT

00:52:38.154 --> 00:52:40.891
WOULD. INVOLVE NOTIFICATION- SO

00:52:40.957 --> 00:52:42.526
ACTUALLY THIS HANDOUT IS UP TO

00:52:42.592 --> 00:52:44.628
DATE AS OF YESTERDAY MORNING-

00:52:44.694 --> 00:52:46.997
BUT THERE ARE- THIS IS

00:52:47.063 --> 00:52:49.432
CONTINUALLY EVOLVING PROCESS

00:52:49.499 --> 00:52:50.066
AND OUR UNDERSTANDING CONTINUES

00:52:50.133 --> 00:52:53.937
TO EVOLVE. SO ON THE THIRD PAGE

00:52:54.004 --> 00:52:56.306
WE PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE

00:52:56.373 --> 00:52:58.909
FEDERAL TRIGGER LEGISLATION- OR

00:52:58.975 --> 00:53:00.911
FEDERAL TRIGGER CONTROL SECTION

00:53:00.977 --> 00:53:02.078
THAT IS PROPOSED BY THE

00:53:02.145 --> 00:53:04.881
ADMINISTRATION. SO ESSENTIALLY-

00:53:04.948 --> 00:53:06.750
THE MAIN REVISION PROPOSES A

00:53:06.816 --> 00:53:10.554
VARIETY OF SOLUTIONS TO SOLVE A

00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:12.389
FIFTY FOUR POINT THREE BILLION

00:53:12.455 --> 00:53:14.791
DOLLAR ON BUDGET DEFICIT. ONE

00:53:14.858 --> 00:53:16.793
OF THOSE SETS OF SOLUTIONS IS

00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:18.428
ABOUT FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS

00:53:18.495 --> 00:53:21.431
IN SPENDING RELATED REDUCTIONS.

00:53:21.498 --> 00:53:24.134
THOSE ARE SHOWN AT THE TABLE-

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:25.936
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PAGE THERE.

00:53:26.002 --> 00:53:27.804
AND ESSENTIALLY WHAT THIS-

00:53:27.871 --> 00:53:29.806
CONTROL SECTION WOULD DO IS SAY

00:53:29.873 --> 00:53:31.541
IF FEDERAL LEGISLATION OR

00:53:31.608 --> 00:53:33.343
FEDERAL FUNDING IS FORTHCOMING

00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:34.878
IN THE COMING WEEKS OR IN THE

00:53:34.945 --> 00:53:38.048
COMING MONTHS. THAT COULDPLANT

00:53:38.114 --> 00:53:40.951
THESE- EXISTING POTS THEN THE

00:53:41.017 --> 00:53:42.352
EXECUTIVE BRANCH WILL HAVE THE

00:53:42.419 --> 00:53:44.154
POWER TO ESSENTIALLY RESTORE

00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:46.790
THE CUTS THAT ARE MADE IN LAW.

00:53:46.856 --> 00:53:48.458
AND THIS WOULD INCLUDE A

00:53:48.525 --> 00:53:50.327
NOTIFICATION TO THE JOINT

00:53:50.393 --> 00:53:54.831
LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE.

00:53:54.898 --> 00:53:58.935
FOR OKAY. SO THE FOLLOWING PAGE

00:53:59.002 --> 00:54:02.672
PROVIDES OUR COMMENTS. ONE

00:54:02.739 --> 00:54:04.841
THING TO START WITH IS THAT HE

00:54:04.908 --> 00:54:06.276
CONTROL SECTIONS THAT ARE

00:54:06.343 --> 00:54:07.477
PROPOSED HERE DIFFER

00:54:07.544 --> 00:54:10.180
SUBSTANTIALLY FROM EXISTING

00:54:10.246 --> 00:54:11.715
BUDGET PROCESS SEES THAT ARE

00:54:11.781 --> 00:54:14.217
ALREADY IN PLACE SO- PASSED

00:54:14.284 --> 00:54:15.819
BUDGET AX HAVE ENVISIONED A

00:54:15.885 --> 00:54:17.954
SITUATION IN WHICH- FEDERAL

00:54:18.021 --> 00:54:20.290
FUNDING IS NEW AND ON

00:54:20.357 --> 00:54:22.125
ANTICIPATED AND COMES AFTER THE

00:54:22.192 --> 00:54:23.927
TIME THAT THE BUDGET IS PASSED

00:54:23.994 --> 00:54:26.529
OR THAT THERE IS A EMERGENCY OR

00:54:26.596 --> 00:54:28.431
THAT THERE IS A CONTINGENCY AT

00:54:28.498 --> 00:54:29.733
A DEPARTMENT FOR WHICH THE

00:54:29.799 --> 00:54:30.600
DEPARTMENT NEEDS NEW MONEY.

00:54:30.667 --> 00:54:33.503
THAT HADN'T BEEN CONTEMPLATED

00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:34.037
AT THE TIME THE BUDGET WAS

00:54:34.104 --> 00:54:37.440
ENACTED. THESE PIECES OF BUDGET

00:54:37.507 --> 00:54:38.908
CONTROL LANGUAGE GENERALLY

00:54:38.975 --> 00:54:39.676
INVOLVE A NUMBER OF

00:54:39.743 --> 00:54:41.711
LIMITATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE THEY

00:54:41.778 --> 00:54:42.579
INCLUDE THIRTY DAY REVIEW

00:54:42.646 --> 00:54:44.047
PERIOD BY THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE

00:54:44.114 --> 00:54:47.150
BUDGET COMMITTEE THEY INVOLVE.

00:54:47.217 --> 00:54:48.451
THEY SPECIFICALLY INVOLVED

00:54:48.518 --> 00:54:50.854
LANGUAGE THAT PRECLUDES THE

00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:52.822
SORT OF CONTROL SECTION PROCESS

00:54:52.889 --> 00:54:55.458
FROM REPLACINGOR SUPPLANTING

00:54:55.525 --> 00:54:57.460
THE EXISTING BUDGETARY PROCESS

00:54:57.527 --> 00:54:59.295
THEY REQUIRE THE FUNDS TO BE ON

00:54:59.362 --> 00:55:01.398
ANTICIPATED THEY REQUIRE THE

00:55:01.464 --> 00:55:03.500
FUNDS TO NOT BE DISCRETIONARY-

00:55:03.566 --> 00:55:04.701
SO THESE ARE JUST EXAMPLES OF

00:55:04.768 --> 00:55:06.269
THELIMITATIONS THAT EXIST KIND

00:55:06.336 --> 00:55:08.638
OF IN. JUST THE TYPICAL BUDGET

00:55:08.705 --> 00:55:10.840
PROCESS FOR DEALING WITH THESE

00:55:10.907 --> 00:55:13.143
THESE ISSUES. NOW THE

00:55:13.209 --> 00:55:14.477
ADMINISTRATION PERHAPS

00:55:14.544 --> 00:55:18.048
REASONABLY- VIEWS IN THIS AS

00:55:18.114 --> 00:55:19.516
TOO RESTRICTIVE IN THE CONTEXT

00:55:19.582 --> 00:55:22.852
OF- BE CURRENT EMERGENCY THAT

00:55:22.919 --> 00:55:25.555
THE STATE IS FACING AND WE DO

00:55:25.622 --> 00:55:27.624
UNDERSTAND THAT THEN THERE IS A

00:55:27.691 --> 00:55:28.625
NEED FOR SOME LEVEL OF

00:55:28.692 --> 00:55:30.193
FLEXIBILITY THAT PERHAPS THE

00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:31.628
EXISTING IN SOME CASES THE

00:55:31.695 --> 00:55:33.496
EXISTING PROCESS THE STATE HAS

00:55:33.563 --> 00:55:35.298
IMPLEMENTED. DOESN'T ALLOW THE

00:55:35.365 --> 00:55:37.200
ADMINISTRATION TO RESPOND SORT

00:55:37.267 --> 00:55:40.203
OF SUFFICIENTLY NIMBLY AND-

00:55:40.270 --> 00:55:41.871
EFFICIENTLY AS IT WITH LIKE IN

00:55:41.938 --> 00:55:43.239
THE IN THE CONTEXT OF AN

00:55:43.306 --> 00:55:44.741
UNPRECEDENTED PUBLIC HEALTH

00:55:44.808 --> 00:55:50.080
EMERGENCY. BUT THAT SAID THE-

00:55:50.146 --> 00:55:52.248
PROPOSALS BY THE ADMINISTRATION

00:55:52.315 --> 00:55:54.951
IN THESE AREAS GO LIKELY TOO

00:55:55.018 --> 00:55:57.187
FAR IN SIDELINING LEGISLATIVE

00:55:57.253 --> 00:55:59.355
AUTHORITY AND IN PRECLUDING THE

00:55:59.422 --> 00:56:01.057
LEGISLATURE'S ABILITY TO

00:56:01.124 --> 00:56:03.493
EXERCISE EFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT

00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:05.395
AND SO THOSE TWO AREAS

00:56:05.462 --> 00:56:07.430
AUTHORITY AND OVERSIGHT ARE

00:56:07.497 --> 00:56:08.932
REALLY AT THE PLACES WHERE WE

00:56:08.998 --> 00:56:11.101
HAVE FOCUSED ON MOST AND LET ME

00:56:11.167 --> 00:56:12.068
JUST GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF

00:56:12.135 --> 00:56:13.636
EXAMPLES FROM THE CONTROL

00:56:13.703 --> 00:56:14.704
SECTIONS ABOUT ABOUT WHAT WE

00:56:14.771 --> 00:56:19.676
MEAN HERE. SO OUT WITH RESPECT

00:56:19.743 --> 00:56:22.645
TO AUTHORITY THE CONTROL

00:56:22.712 --> 00:56:24.347
SECTION ELEVEN POINT NINE FIVE

00:56:24.414 --> 00:56:25.648
THE ONE THAT- ANTICIPATES KIND

00:56:25.715 --> 00:56:27.150
OF HYPOTHETICAL FUTURE NEW

00:56:27.217 --> 00:56:29.219
FEDERAL FINES ESSENTIALLY

00:56:29.285 --> 00:56:31.421
ALLOWS THE ADMINISTRATION TO

00:56:31.488 --> 00:56:33.923
TAKE ON THE LEGISLATURE'S POWER

00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:36.459
OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR THOSE

00:56:36.526 --> 00:56:42.132
FUTURE FUNDS IN IN WHAT IS. I

00:56:42.198 --> 00:56:44.501
CONTROL SECTION THIRTY SIX

00:56:44.567 --> 00:56:46.636
WHICH- WOULD IT BE THE CONTROL

00:56:46.703 --> 00:56:48.171
SECTION THAT WOULD GUIDE THAT

00:56:48.238 --> 00:56:49.539
THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN CAN

00:56:49.606 --> 00:56:51.775
KOBE CONTINGENCY FUNDS REALLY

00:56:51.841 --> 00:56:53.877
AGAIN WITH ONLY A SEVENTY TWO

HOUR NOTIFICATION TO THE JOINT

00:56:55.178 --> 00:56:56.479
LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE

00:56:56.546 --> 00:56:58.615
WOULD ALLOW THE ADMINISTRATION

00:56:58.681 --> 00:57:00.383
TO ALLOCATE THREE BILLION

00:57:00.450 --> 00:57:03.753
DOLLARS. IN CALL AS LONG AS IT

00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:05.388
WAS KOBE RELATED FUNDING REALLY

00:57:05.455 --> 00:57:07.891
WITHOUT AIR AND DECISION MAKING

00:57:07.957 --> 00:57:10.126
BY THE LEGISLATURE JUST

00:57:10.193 --> 00:57:12.195
NOTIFICATION TO THE LEGISLATURE.

00:57:12.262 --> 00:57:14.397
AND THEN FINALLY- ELEVEN POINT

00:57:14.464 --> 00:57:15.765
NINE ZERO THE ONE THAT CONCERN

00:57:15.832 --> 00:57:17.167
TO THE NINE AND A HALF BILLION

00:57:17.233 --> 00:57:18.201
DOLLARS IN CORONA VIRUS RELIEF

00:57:18.268 --> 00:57:19.936
FUNDS REALLY ALLOWS THE

00:57:20.003 --> 00:57:21.838
ADMINISTRATION TO REALLOCATE

00:57:21.905 --> 00:57:24.474
THOUGHT FUNDING- IN. IN ANY

00:57:24.541 --> 00:57:24.974
MANNER AS LONG AS IT'S

00:57:25.041 --> 00:57:27.210
CONSISTENT WITH ALL THE FEDERAL

00:57:27.277 --> 00:57:29.245
GUIDELINES DESPITE THE FACT

00:57:29.312 --> 00:57:30.313
THAT A PLAN WILL HAVE BEEN

00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:32.015
ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN

00:57:32.081 --> 00:57:35.251
MID JUNE- FOR HOW TO SPEND

00:57:35.318 --> 00:57:38.054
THOSE FUNDS. THEN JUST A COUPLE

00:57:38.121 --> 00:57:39.322
OF EXAMPLES IN THE OVERSIGHT

00:57:39.389 --> 00:57:42.358
ROUND. SO THERE AREN'T ANY

00:57:42.425 --> 00:57:43.860
SPECIFIC INFORMATION

00:57:43.927 --> 00:57:45.662
REQUIREMENTS REGARDING-

00:57:45.728 --> 00:57:47.230

00:57:47.297 --> 00:57:49.098
SECTION THIRTY SIX IN IN THE

00:57:49.165 --> 00:57:51.367
CASE OF CONTROL SECTION THIRTY

00:57:51.434 --> 00:57:52.535
SIX REALLY THE FUNDING-

00:57:52.602 --> 00:57:54.604
REQUIRES A NOTIFICATION BUT NO

VERY SPECIFICALLY THE FUNDS

00:58:02.912 --> 00:58:05.915
WOULD BE ALLOCATED. AND THEN

00:58:05.982 --> 00:58:09.485
SIMILARLY ON THE- JURY- OF-

00:58:09.552 --> 00:58:12.055
AUTHORIZATIONS- ALTHOUGH THERE

00:58:12.121 --> 00:58:14.290
IS A NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENT

00:58:14.357 --> 00:58:15.825
ABOUT WHEN THE FUND IS ARE

THIRTY SIX WITH NOTIFICATIONS

00:58:25.268 --> 00:58:26.336
ABOUT HOW THOSE FUNDS ARE

00:58:26.402 --> 00:58:28.705
ULTIMATELY ALLOCATED. AND WITH

00:58:28.771 --> 00:58:29.639
THE CABBIE OUT THAT WE DID

00:58:29.706 --> 00:58:30.506
RECEIVE SOME ADDITIONAL

00:58:30.573 --> 00:58:32.942
INFORMATION OUT YESTERDAY ABOUT

00:58:33.009 --> 00:58:35.345
THIS LAST NIGHT ABOUT THIS- TO

00:58:35.411 --> 00:58:36.846
DATE WE HAVE HAD VERY LITTLE

00:58:36.913 --> 00:58:38.414
INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THE

00:58:38.481 --> 00:58:41.851
ADMINISTRATION HAS SPENT. THOSE

00:58:41.918 --> 00:58:46.990
THREE OFF FUNDS. SO THE FOR THE

00:58:47.056 --> 00:58:49.092
NEXT PAGE PAGE FIVE PROVIDES

00:58:49.158 --> 00:58:51.961
SOME OPTIONS AND WE REALLY VIEW

00:58:52.028 --> 00:58:55.031
THESE OPTIONS AS- SEEKING TO

00:58:55.098 --> 00:58:56.399
ACHIEVE A BETTER BALANCE

00:58:56.466 --> 00:58:57.901
BETWEEN THE NEED FOR

00:58:57.967 --> 00:59:00.236
ADMINISTRATIONS. FLEXIBILITY IN

00:59:00.303 --> 00:59:01.638
LIGHT OF THE EMERGENCY WHICH WE

00:59:01.704 --> 00:59:03.706
DO UNDERSTAND IS IMPORTANT BUT

00:59:03.773 --> 00:59:06.843
ALSO THE NEED FOR LEGISLATIVE

00:59:06.910 --> 00:59:07.377
AUTHORITY AND LEGISLATIVE

00:59:07.443 --> 00:59:09.746
OVERSIGHT. SO I WON'T WALK

00:59:09.812 --> 00:59:10.713
THROUGH ALL OF THESE OPTIONS IN

00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:11.915
DETAIL BECAUSE THERE'S A NUMBER

00:59:11.981 --> 00:59:12.749
OF THEM IN THE HANDOUT BUT I

00:59:12.815 --> 00:59:14.918
JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT A

00:59:14.984 --> 00:59:17.587
COUPLE OF IMPORTANT ONES. SO

00:59:17.654 --> 00:59:18.888
FIRST JUST TAKING THE ONES

00:59:18.955 --> 00:59:20.189
RELATED TO STATE SPENDING SO

00:59:20.256 --> 00:59:21.224
THESE ARE REALLY ABOUT CONTROL

00:59:21.291 --> 00:59:23.192
SECTION THIRTY SIX AND THREE OH

00:59:23.259 --> 00:59:25.561
UP- WE THINK THAT IT MIGHT MAKE

00:59:25.628 --> 00:59:26.529
SENSE TO HAVE A DIFFERENT

00:59:26.596 --> 00:59:28.231
PROCESS IN PLACE DEPENDING ON

00:59:28.298 --> 00:59:29.732
WHETHER THE LEGISLATURE IS IN

00:59:29.799 --> 00:59:31.734
SESSION OR NOT IN SESSION. SO

00:59:31.801 --> 00:59:33.469
SB EIGHTY NINE WAS ENACTED JUST

00:59:33.536 --> 00:59:34.737
BEFORE THE LEGISLATUR WENT ON

00:59:34.804 --> 00:59:36.806
AN EXTENDED RECESS IN RESPONSE

00:59:36.873 --> 00:59:38.241
TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY.

00:59:38.308 --> 00:59:41.611
AND IT WAS ENACTED IN LIGHT OF

00:59:41.678 --> 00:59:43.913
THAT SITUATION. BUT PERHAPS A

00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:45.548
DIFFERENT NOTIFICATION PROCESS

00:59:45.615 --> 00:59:46.683
OR EVEN A DIFFERENT PROCESS

00:59:46.749 --> 00:59:48.851
ENTIRELY IS APPROPRIATE IF THE

00:59:48.918 --> 00:59:51.254
LEGISLATURE IS IN SESSION- AND

00:59:51.321 --> 00:59:53.089
IS ABLE TO ACT MORE QUICKLY%

00:59:53.156 --> 00:59:54.624
THAN IT WOULD BE IF IT WERE OUT

00:59:54.691 --> 00:59:58.061
OF SESSION. ON ELIGIBLE USES OF

00:59:58.127 --> 00:59:59.696
FUNDS- JUST SOMETHING TO

00:59:59.762 --> 01:00:01.764
EMPHASIZE HERE IS THAT THE

01:00:01.831 --> 01:00:03.700
PANDEMIC HOUSE REQUIRED THE

01:00:03.766 --> 01:00:06.369
STATE TO ENTER INTO VERY NEW

01:00:06.436 --> 01:00:08.604
KINDS OF EXPENDITURES. NEW

01:00:08.671 --> 01:00:10.840
KINDS OF CONTRACTS THAT- YOU

01:00:10.907 --> 01:00:13.576
KNOW ARE ARE QUITE ATYPICAL FOR

01:00:13.643 --> 01:00:15.578
THE STATE'S- ORDINARY COURSE OF

01:00:15.645 --> 01:00:17.714
BUSINESS. AND UNLIKE WITH OTHER

01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:19.649
DISASTERS FOR EXAMPLE A WILD

01:00:19.716 --> 01:00:21.517
FIRE WHERE THE TYPES OF

01:00:21.584 --> 01:00:22.919
ACTIVITIES THAT THE STATE WOULD

01:00:22.986 --> 01:00:24.921
TAKE ON ASSOCIATED WITH THAT

01:00:24.988 --> 01:00:28.591
WILD FIRE QUITE KNOWN. IN THE

01:00:28.658 --> 01:00:30.860
ACTUALLY QUITE

01:00:30.927 --> 01:00:33.830
IN SEVERAL CASES THE- THE TYPES

01:00:33.896 --> 01:00:35.365
OF EXPENDITURES AT THE TAKE THE

01:00:35.431 --> 01:00:37.066
STATE IS TAKING ON A QUITE NOW.

01:00:37.133 --> 01:00:39.402
AND SO- ONE OPTION FOR

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:40.770
CONSIDERATION WOULD BE TO

01:00:40.837 --> 01:00:42.772
CONSIDER THE TYPES OF ELIGIBLE

01:00:42.839 --> 01:00:44.707
FUNDS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE TO BE

01:00:44.774 --> 01:00:46.542
ALLOCATED UNDER DIFFERENT TYPES

01:00:46.609 --> 01:00:48.811
OF AUTHORITY AND WHETHER IT

01:00:48.878 --> 01:00:51.280
WOULD MAKE SENSE TO PLACE SOME

01:00:51.347 --> 01:00:51.781
LIMITS ON THOSE TYPES OF

01:00:51.848 --> 01:00:56.119
ELIGIBLE FUNDS. THE FINAL PAGE-

01:00:56.185 --> 01:00:58.354
CONCERNS BE CONTROL SECTIONS

01:00:58.421 --> 01:00:59.188
AND THE AUTHORITIES THAT ARE

01:00:59.255 --> 01:01:01.190
BEING PROPOSED FOR FEDERAL

01:01:01.257 --> 01:01:02.725
FUNDING IN PARTICULAR AND SO

01:01:02.792 --> 01:01:04.894
THIS IS ELEVEN POINT NINE ZERO.

01:01:04.961 --> 01:01:07.230
ELEVEN POINT NINE FIVE AND THEN

01:01:07.296 --> 01:01:07.830
THE CONTROL SECTION EIGHT TWO

01:01:07.897 --> 01:01:09.432
EIGHT. I GOT I WON'T WALK

01:01:09.499 --> 01:01:11.100
THROUGH THESE IN DETAIL BUT

01:01:11.167 --> 01:01:11.734
JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT A

01:01:11.801 --> 01:01:14.537
COUPLE OF NOTES- THE PROCESS

01:01:14.604 --> 01:01:15.605
AGAIN MIGHT MAKE SENSE TO BE

01:01:15.671 --> 01:01:16.606
DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON WHETHER

01:01:16.672 --> 01:01:18.174
OR NOT THE LEGISLATURE'S AND-

01:01:18.241 --> 01:01:21.644
IN SESSION. ON ON TYPICAL

01:01:21.711 --> 01:01:23.346
CONTROL SECTIONS THAT THE STATE

01:01:23.413 --> 01:01:24.580
HAS IN PLACE FOR DEALING WITH

01:01:24.647 --> 01:01:25.915
ON ANTICIPATED FEDERAL

01:01:25.982 --> 01:01:27.016
EXPENDITURES IT'S ACTUALLY

01:01:27.083 --> 01:01:28.618
QUITE CLEAR IN BUDGET LANGUAGE

01:01:28.684 --> 01:01:30.186
THAT IT IS NOT INTENDED TO

01:01:30.253 --> 01:01:32.488
REPLACE THE BUDGET PROCESS SO.

01:01:32.555 --> 01:01:34.657
THAT IS AN EXAMPLE OF A KIND OF

01:01:34.724 --> 01:01:36.059
LIMITATION- THAT MIGHT MAKE

01:01:36.125 --> 01:01:37.160
SENSE AGAIN IN THIS CONTEXT

01:01:37.226 --> 01:01:38.628
DEPENDING ON. YOU KNOW HOW

01:01:38.694 --> 01:01:41.264
QUICKLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:01:41.330 --> 01:01:41.898
IS REQUIRING THE STATE TO SPEND

01:01:41.964 --> 01:01:43.800
THE MONEY. AND THEN ALL THE

01:01:43.866 --> 01:01:45.835
FEDERAL TRIGGERS IN PARTICULAR

01:01:45.902 --> 01:01:47.437
SOMETHING THAT WE NOTED IN OUR

01:01:47.503 --> 01:01:48.971
OVERALL COMMENTS TO THEM A

01:01:49.038 --> 01:01:50.873
REVISION. IS THAT IF MORE

01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:51.941
FEDERAL AID IS FORTHCOMING

01:01:52.008 --> 01:01:53.643
PARTICULARLY IF SUBSTANTIAL

01:01:53.709 --> 01:01:55.478
FEDERAL AID IS FORTHCOMING. IT

01:01:55.545 --> 01:01:56.712
MIGHT MAKE SENSE FOR THE

01:01:56.779 --> 01:01:58.214
LEGISLATURE TO RECONSIDER THE

01:01:58.281 --> 01:02:00.116
ENTIRE STRUCTURE OF THE BUDGET

01:02:00.183 --> 01:02:01.951
NOT JUST- THE SPENDING

01:02:02.018 --> 01:02:02.952
REDUCTIONS THAT ARE BEING

01:02:03.019 --> 01:02:04.320
PROPOSED TO BE SUBJECT TO THE

01:02:04.387 --> 01:02:06.255
TRIGGER. AND SO IN THAT CASE-

01:02:06.322 --> 01:02:08.691
PERHAPS MID YEAR BUDGET ACTION

01:02:08.758 --> 01:02:10.293
WOULD BE WARRANTED IN STATEN.

01:02:10.359 --> 01:02:11.928
FINALLY IT'S NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR

01:02:11.994 --> 01:02:14.430
TO US WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. IF

01:02:14.497 --> 01:02:16.365
LESS THAN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY

01:02:16.432 --> 01:02:17.600
THAT IS NEEDED TO RESTORE THE

01:02:17.667 --> 01:02:19.102
SPENDING CUTS ARE LESS THAN

01:02:19.168 --> 01:02:20.069
FOURTEEN BILLION A FIFTEEN

01:02:20.136 --> 01:02:21.771
BILLION DOLLARS. IS GIVEN TO

01:02:21.838 --> 01:02:23.673
THE STATE- FROM FEDERAL

01:02:23.739 --> 01:02:25.241
ASSISTANCE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

01:02:25.308 --> 01:02:26.609
WOULD IT BE PRO RATED ACROSS A

01:02:26.676 --> 01:02:28.744
VARIETY OF DEPARTMENTS WOULD-

01:02:28.811 --> 01:02:30.880
SOME DEPARTMENTS RECEIVE CUTS

01:02:30.947 --> 01:02:32.682
AND OTHERS WOULD NOT- THOSE

01:02:32.748 --> 01:02:33.549
KINDS OF IMPLEMENTATION

01:02:33.616 --> 01:02:36.185
QUESTIONS BE CONTROL SECTION

01:02:36.252 --> 01:02:38.054
LANGUAGE IS STILL SILENT TIM.

01:02:38.121 --> 01:02:40.456
SO WITH THAT- I'M HAPPY TO TAKE

01:02:40.523 --> 01:02:42.291
ANY QUESTIONS WENDY APPROPRIATE

01:02:42.358 --> 01:02:44.727
MOMENT ARISES THANK YOU. THANK

01:02:44.794 --> 01:02:46.829

01:03:02.478 --> 01:03:04.280
COMMITTEE- I'LL KEEP MY

01:03:04.347 --> 01:03:05.314
COMMENTS VERY BRIEF TO RESERVE

01:03:05.381 --> 01:03:06.616
THE BALANCE OF THE TIME FOR

01:03:06.682 --> 01:03:08.784
QUESTIONS I WANT TO MAKE THREE

01:03:08.851 --> 01:03:09.585
POINTS ON BEHALF OF THE

01:03:09.652 --> 01:03:11.454
ADMINISTRATION. THE FIRST IS

01:03:11.521 --> 01:03:13.890
THAT THE UPDATED ESTIMATES-

01:03:13.956 --> 01:03:16.292
THAT WERE IN THE NAY REVISION

01:03:16.359 --> 01:03:17.460
OR ALSO REFLECTED IN THE LETTER

01:03:17.527 --> 01:03:19.395
THAT WAS SENT LATE LAST NIGHT

01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:21.430
OURSTAFF HAS BEEN WORKING. DAY

01:03:21.497 --> 01:03:22.298
AND NIGHT TO CLARIFY THE

01:03:22.365 --> 01:03:23.900
EXPENDITURES AS MUCH AS

01:03:23.966 --> 01:03:25.334
POSSIBLE RIGHT NOW WE ARE

01:03:25.401 --> 01:03:27.870
EXPECTING- NET GENERAL FUND

01:03:27.937 --> 01:03:29.505
COST OF ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION

01:03:29.572 --> 01:03:31.974
DOLLARS FOR THESE EXPENDITURES

01:03:32.041 --> 01:03:33.342
AND THIS REFLECTS- THE VARIOUS

01:03:33.409 --> 01:03:35.811
STREAMS FROM THE SECTION THIRTY

01:03:35.878 --> 01:03:37.146
SIX ALLOCATIONS UNDER SB EIGHTY

01:03:37.213 --> 01:03:40.082
NINE. TO THE TRIO ALLOCATIONS-

01:03:40.149 --> 01:03:40.950
AS WELL AS FEDERAL

01:03:41.017 --> 01:03:43.519
REIMBURSEMENT THAT BEING SAID-

01:03:43.586 --> 01:03:44.854
I DO WANT TO STRESS THAT THIS

01:03:44.921 --> 01:03:46.422
IS A POINT IN TIME ESTIMATE-

01:03:46.489 --> 01:03:48.157
THE COURSE OF THE PANDEMIC IN

01:03:48.224 --> 01:03:49.759
THE WEEKS AND MONTHS TO COME IS

01:03:49.825 --> 01:03:52.161
VERY UNCERTAIN SO WE WILL KEEP

01:03:52.228 --> 01:03:53.529
IN TOUCH WITH THE LEGISLATURE

01:03:53.596 --> 01:03:55.464
AS WE ARE CONSTANTLY REFINING.

01:03:55.531 --> 01:03:57.567
OUR ESTIMATES- AND AS WE GET

01:03:57.633 --> 01:03:59.535
MORE DETAIL- FROM THE FEDERAL

01:03:59.602 --> 01:04:01.370
GOVERNMENT WE WILL MAKE SURE TO

01:04:01.437 --> 01:04:03.072
INCORPORATE THAT AS WELL. I

01:04:03.139 --> 01:04:04.640
SHOULD MENTION THAT JUST THIS

01:04:04.707 --> 01:04:06.375
WEEK THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND

01:04:06.442 --> 01:04:07.643
THE WHITE HOUSE RELEASED

01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:09.345
ADDITIONAL DETAIL AND SOME

01:04:09.412 --> 01:04:11.047
GREATER FLEXIBILITY ON THE USES

01:04:11.113 --> 01:04:12.448
OF THE CORONA VIRUS FOR WE

01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:15.017
FIND. THAT THE LA- MENTIONED SO

01:04:15.084 --> 01:04:16.219
THESE ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS

01:04:16.285 --> 01:04:17.253
THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:20.723
INCORPORATE AS WE UPDATE OUR

01:04:20.790 --> 01:04:21.290
ESTIMATES. THE SECOND ONE I

01:04:21.357 --> 01:04:23.125
WANT TO MAKE IS- WITH REGARD TO

01:04:23.192 --> 01:04:24.393
SOME THE CONTROL SECTIONS THAT

01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:26.062
I KNOW MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE

01:04:26.128 --> 01:04:27.463
I HAVE ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT.

01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:29.265
AND THAT THE LA- MENTIONED AS

01:04:29.332 --> 01:04:31.834
WELL. THE PURPOSE OF DRAFTING

01:04:31.901 --> 01:04:33.035
THESE CONTROLS ACTIONS THE WAY

01:04:33.102 --> 01:04:35.905
WE DID WAS TO MAXIMIZE FEDERAL

01:04:35.972 --> 01:04:37.840
REIMBURSEMENT AND MAKING SURE.

01:04:37.907 --> 01:04:39.675
THAT THE STATE IS MEETING AS

01:04:39.742 --> 01:04:41.043
WELL AS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE

01:04:41.110 --> 01:04:42.311
MEETING ALL THE DEADLINES AND

01:04:42.378 --> 01:04:43.846
CONDITIONS. TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:04:43.913 --> 01:04:45.781
WE ARE USING ALL THE MONEY THAT

01:04:45.848 --> 01:04:46.882
HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THE STATE

01:04:46.949 --> 01:04:48.651
OF CALIFORNIA. AS WELL AS LOCAL

01:04:48.718 --> 01:04:50.586
GOVERNMENTS. WE ARE OPEN TO

01:04:50.653 --> 01:04:52.555
FEEDBACK ON HOW TO REFINE THIS

01:04:52.622 --> 01:04:54.590
CONTROL SECTIONS TO MAKE SURE.

01:04:54.657 --> 01:04:55.858
THAT WE ARE ABLE TO DO THAT

01:04:55.925 --> 01:04:57.827
CONSISTENT WITH NOTIFICATION

01:04:57.893 --> 01:04:59.028
AND ENGAGEMENT WITH THE

01:04:59.095 --> 01:05:01.130
LEGISLATURE- WHILE BALANCING

01:05:01.197 --> 01:05:02.632
THAT AGAINST THE NEED TO.

01:05:02.698 --> 01:05:04.400
ENSURE THAT IS A LITTLE OF

01:05:04.467 --> 01:05:05.601
THOSE DOLLARS ARE REVERTED BACK

01:05:05.668 --> 01:05:07.069
TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. FOR

01:05:07.136 --> 01:05:08.504
NOT MEETING THE CONDITIONS THAT

01:05:08.571 --> 01:05:10.306
WERE ALLOCATED. AS THE LA-

01:05:10.373 --> 01:05:12.174
MENTIONED- BASED ON FEEDBACK

01:05:12.241 --> 01:05:13.409
THAT WE'VE RECEIVED WE'VE

01:05:13.476 --> 01:05:14.744
ALREADY UPDATED LEGISLATIVE

01:05:14.810 --> 01:05:17.413
STAFF ON INCLUDING A TEN DAY

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:18.681
LEGISLATIVE NOTIFICATION.

01:05:18.748 --> 01:05:20.916
REQUIREMENTS INTO SOME OF THAT

01:05:20.983 --> 01:05:22.351
CONTROL SECTION LANGUAGE.

01:05:22.418 --> 01:05:23.786
SIMILAR THOUGHT WHEN IT COMES

01:05:23.853 --> 01:05:25.621
TO THE TRIGGER. THE PURPOSE OF

01:05:25.688 --> 01:05:27.823
THE TRIGGER IS AS WE KNOW AND

01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:28.858
HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING IN THE

01:05:28.924 --> 01:05:30.593
LAST COUPLE DAYS. WITH ALL OF

01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:32.862
YOU. THE NAY REVISION AB

01:05:32.928 --> 01:05:34.563
REFLECTS AND BASS CUTS. IN THE

01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:35.931
BUDGET IN ADDITION TO PULLING

01:05:35.998 --> 01:05:37.533
BACK AND WITHDRAWING THE

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:39.268
EXPANSIONS THAT THE GOVERNOR

01:05:39.335 --> 01:05:41.570
PROPOSED IN JANUARY. THESE CUTS

01:05:41.637 --> 01:05:43.072
ARE VERY PAINFUL THEY AFFECT

01:05:43.139 --> 01:05:45.141
JUST ABOUT EVERY PROGRAM. AND

01:05:45.207 --> 01:05:46.375
SO WE'VE BUILT IN A TRIGGER

01:05:46.442 --> 01:05:48.044
WHERE IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:05:48.110 --> 01:05:49.578
PROVIDES A CERTAIN OUT

01:05:49.645 --> 01:05:51.380
APPROXIMATELY FOURTEEN BILLION

01:05:51.447 --> 01:05:53.482
DOLLARS. ALL THOSE CUTS CAN BE

01:05:53.549 --> 01:05:55.818
RESTORED AND THEY WOULD AFFECT

01:05:55.885 --> 01:05:57.720
ALL OF THOSE PROGRAMS. BUT AS

01:05:57.787 --> 01:05:59.822
MENTIONED WE ARE. HAPPY TO

01:05:59.889 --> 01:06:01.223
LISTEN TO FEEDBACK WHEN IT

01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:03.092
COMES TO ADDITIONAL IDEAS ON

01:06:03.159 --> 01:06:04.660
HOW TO SET UP THAT TRIGGER TO

01:06:04.727 --> 01:06:05.428
MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

01:06:05.494 --> 01:06:07.029
MAXIMIZING BE USED. A FEDERAL

01:06:07.096 --> 01:06:09.231
FUNDING AND AVOIDING THE IS

01:06:09.298 --> 01:06:10.866
CUTS THAT UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S

01:06:10.933 --> 01:06:13.769
PROPOSAL. WOULD OTHERWISE GOING

01:06:13.836 --> 01:06:14.670
TO A FACT ON LIFE FIRST IN

01:06:14.737 --> 01:06:16.072
ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE

01:06:16.138 --> 01:06:20.509
CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT. OF

01:06:20.576 --> 01:06:21.277
A BALANCED BUDGET. THE FINAL

01:06:21.344 --> 01:06:22.945
POINT I'LL MAKE IS I KNOW AND

01:06:23.012 --> 01:06:23.979
THE NEW KNOWS THAT THERE ARE

01:06:24.046 --> 01:06:26.048
PAN A LOT OF. ON THE- CAN.

01:06:26.115 --> 01:06:28.718
RESERVE IN THE MAY REVISION- WE

01:06:28.784 --> 01:06:30.553
HAVE PUT OUT WHAT WE EXPECT AT

01:06:30.619 --> 01:06:31.721
THIS POINT IN TIME.

01:06:31.787 --> 01:06:34.090
EXPENDITURES WILL BE- BUT THE

01:06:34.156 --> 01:06:36.125
TRUTH IS THAT THIS EMERGENCY IS

01:06:36.192 --> 01:06:38.094
ONGOING AND WHILE YOU KNOW

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:39.161
TRENDS AS THE GOVERNOR HAS

01:06:39.228 --> 01:06:41.330
MENTIONED- HAVE BEEN GETTING A

01:06:41.397 --> 01:06:42.565
LITTLE BIT BETTER IN THE LAST

01:06:42.631 --> 01:06:44.400
COUPLE DAYS AND WEEKS. WE DON'T

01:06:44.467 --> 01:06:46.035
KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN

01:06:46.102 --> 01:06:47.603
THE SUMMER AND THE FALL AND SO

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:48.738
WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION

01:06:48.804 --> 01:06:50.673
PROPOSES TO DO. IS IN THE

01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:52.641
BUDGET PROCESS BILL DIDN'T

01:06:52.708 --> 01:06:54.643
BUILDING A CONTINGENCY SO THAT

01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:55.745
THEY IF THERE IS A HOSPITAL

01:06:55.811 --> 01:06:57.646
<u>EARCH OR A RESURGENCE IN THE</u>

01:06:57.713 --> 01:06:59.749
PANDEMIC. IN THE FALL

01:06:59.815 --> 01:07:01.016
ESPECIALLY THE LEGISLATURE IS

01:07:01.083 --> 01:07:02.651
OUT OF SESSION THAT THE

01:07:02.718 --> 01:07:03.853
ADMINISTRATION IN THE STATE HAS

01:07:03.919 --> 01:07:06.822
THE ABILITY TO ACT. I THINK- WE

01:07:06.889 --> 01:07:08.023
ALL KNOW FROM SEEING WHAT'S

01:07:08.090 --> 01:07:09.191
HAPPENED IN OTHER PARTS OF THE

01:07:09.258 --> 01:07:10.926
COUNTRY. AND OTHER PARTS OF THE

01:07:10.993 --> 01:07:13.028
WORLD- THAT ACTING WHEN IT

01:07:13.095 --> 01:07:15.231
COMES THIS PANDEMIC. IN A

01:07:15.297 --> 01:07:17.133
MATTER OF WEEKS OR EVEN DAYS.

01:07:17.199 --> 01:07:19.602
COMPARED TO WINE ESTATE OR OUR

01:07:19.668 --> 01:07:21.470
COUNTRY MAY HAVE ACTED. COULD

01:07:21.537 --> 01:07:22.738
LITERALLY COUNT FOR HUNDREDS OR

01:07:22.805 --> 01:07:24.874
THOUSANDS OF LIVES SAVED. SO WE

01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:26.809
WANT TO MAKE SURE TO MAXIMIZE

01:07:26.876 --> 01:07:27.443
ENGAGEMENT WITH THE

01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:29.578
LEGISLATURE. THROUGH THE SUMMER

01:07:29.645 --> 01:07:30.980
THROUGH THE FALL IN TERMS OF

01:07:31.046 --> 01:07:32.481
HOW THE X. EXPENDITURES ARE

01:07:32.548 --> 01:07:34.250
BEING MADE. BUT GIVEN THAT WE

01:07:34.316 --> 01:07:35.418
DO NOT KNOW HOW THIS IS GOING

01:07:35.484 --> 01:07:37.219
TO GO. WE DO ALSO WANT TO MAKE

01:07:37.286 --> 01:07:39.288
SURE THAT THERE IS NECESSARY

01:07:39.355 --> 01:07:40.189
FLEXIBILITY. SHOULD THE

01:07:40.256 --> 01:07:41.724
PANDEMIC RETURNED TO HIGHER

01:07:41.791 --> 01:07:43.559
LEVELS ARE EVEN HIGHER LEVELS

01:07:43.626 --> 01:07:44.527
THAN WE HAVE SEEN UP TO THIS

01:07:44.593 --> 01:07:46.695
POINT. SO WITH THAT I WANT TO

01:07:46.762 --> 01:07:47.963
KEEP MY COMMENTS VERY BRIEF I

01:07:48.030 --> 01:07:49.231
KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF ISSUES

01:07:49.298 --> 01:07:50.533
TO DISCUSS AND WE'RE VERY HAPPY

01:07:50.599 --> 01:07:53.235

01:19:45.147 --> 01:19:47.149
A SECTOR THAT THAT NEEDS THIS

01:19:47.215 --> 01:19:50.519
PROTECTION. IS THE WHOLE-

01:19:50.585 --> 01:19:52.187
CONTRACT IN THE ONE BILLION AND

01:19:52.254 --> 01:19:54.089
I THINK WE GOT OVER THAT OVER

01:19:54.156 --> 01:19:56.391
AND OVER AND OVER BUT- IF IT

01:19:56.458 --> 01:19:58.093
LEADS TO THAT QUESTION IS THAT

01:19:58.160 --> 01:19:59.361
THE REASON THAT THE GOVERNOR

01:19:59.427 --> 01:20:01.530
DEAD AS AS CHAIRMAN TING SAID

01:20:01.596 --> 01:20:03.298
GO OUT AND ANNOUNCE THIS AND WE

01:20:03.365 --> 01:20:05.066
HEARD ABOUT IT ON. ON THE

01:20:05.133 --> 01:20:07.102
NATIONAL TV SHOW BUT IT IS WHAT

01:20:07.169 --> 01:20:09.804
IT IS WAS TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA

01:20:09.871 --> 01:20:11.373
IN TO MAKE A MAJOR BOOK

01:20:11.439 --> 01:20:13.742
PURCHASING THAT FELL APART WHEN

01:20:13.808 --> 01:20:16.044
WE ARE IS- SCAMMERS THAT PUT

01:20:16.111 --> 01:20:17.012
TOGETHER AN INDUSTRY THREE DAYS

01:20:17.078 --> 01:20:18.813
BEFORE AND WIRED MONEY IT

01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:21.416
SOUNDS LIKE A- CRAZY TV MOVIE.

01:20:21.483 --> 01:20:22.784
MADE FOR TV MOVIE BUT

01:20:22.851 --> 01:20:25.620
NONETHELESS WE DIDN'T LOSE OUT

01:20:25.687 --> 01:20:26.855
A SIGNIFICANT WAY WOULD BE

01:20:26.922 --> 01:20:28.490
PROTECTED TAXPAYERS BUT A BEGS

01:20:28.557 --> 01:20:30.392
THE QUESTION WHERE ARE WE NOW

01:20:30.458 --> 01:20:32.460
ON THESE MASKS- WHERE WE

01:20:32.527 --> 01:20:34.396
OPENING OUR ECONOMY. WE'RE

01:20:34.462 --> 01:20:36.531
OPENING- IS THE SENSE OF

01:20:36.598 --> 01:20:37.399
WORKERS THAN THE DEFINITION

01:20:37.465 --> 01:20:39.434
THAT EXPANDED EXPONENTIALLY BY

01:20:39.501 --> 01:20:41.069
THESE COUNTY ORDERS RIGHTFULLY

01:20:41.136 --> 01:20:44.439
SO- THERE COULD BE A SECOND

01:20:44.506 --> 01:20:47.309
WAVE AS AS WE AS WE NOW WE HOPE

01:20:47.375 --> 01:20:52.447
NOT SO. DEALS ARE AS WE WRAP

01:20:52.514 --> 01:20:52.981
AND I KNOW THERE ARE SOME

01:20:53.048 --> 01:20:57.886
ISSUES IS AS- THEN I IT'S-

01:20:57.953 --> 01:21:01.423

01:56:24.043 --> 01:56:30.249
TRAINING AND STICKS AMONG

01:56:30.316 --> 01:56:33.219

MANY OF MARK WHO WHY DO SEES R.

01:56:39.525 --> 01:56:40.593
SKATE ANYTIME OF WHAT WE IT

01:56:40.660 --> 01:56:42.462
COULD TO BE REASONABLE. THE

01:56:42.528 --> 01:56:43.863
OTHER THING I IS THAT YOU CAN

01:56:43.930 --> 01:56:46.265
ANSWER FOR ME TO IS THAT WE ASK

01:56:46.332 --> 01:56:47.967
THE QUESTION YESTERDAY ABOUT-

01:56:48.034 --> 01:56:50.036
AND IDEA TO ABOUT THE- CLOSING

01:56:50.103 --> 01:56:52.205
THE PRISONS THAT WE HAVE SLATED

01:56:52.271 --> 01:56:53.873
TO CLOSE TWO PRISONS IN THE

01:56:53.940 --> 01:56:55.675
NEXT COUPLE YEARS AND THAT

01:56:55.742 --> 01:56:58.578
SOUNDS GREAT UP IT WHAT WHAT

01:56:58.644 --> 01:57:00.046
KIND OF WONDER ONE IS HOW CAN

01:57:00.113 --> 01:57:03.416
WE PREDICT OF THE AMOUNT OF

01:57:03.483 --> 01:57:05.084
MONEY WOULD BE. WE DON'T KNOW

01:57:05.151 --> 01:57:07.286
WHAT CLOSE WE DON'T KNOW I

01:57:07.353 --> 01:57:10.056
WOULD HAVE TO DO. WITH WITH

01:57:10.123 --> 01:57:10.623
REGARD TO THE- IN TERMS OF

01:57:13.159 --> 01:57:14.193
WE'RE GOING TO SAVE IF WE DON'T

01:57:14.260 --> 01:57:15.762

THAT'S THE CAT- BUT HUNTING

02:01:01.988 --> 02:01:03.189
YESTERDAY EITHER SO OKAY. OKAY

02:01:03.255 --> 02:01:04.523

02:01:04.590 --> 02:01:05.958
OF ALL THAT- OUR DEAL OF

02:01:06.025 --> 02:01:06.726
COLLEAGUES WHO WORK ON PUBLIC

SAFETY GET BACK TO ON THESE

02:01:08.094 --> 02:01:09.328
ISSUES- I WILL JUST MAKE. THREE

02:01:09.395 --> 02:01:11.297
POINTS. OUT THAT I KNOW YOU

02:01:11.364 --> 02:01:12.365
KNOW IN TERMS OF THE BROADER

02:01:12.431 --> 02:01:13.799
STRUCTURE OF THE BUDGET AND-

02:01:13.866 --> 02:01:15.267
CDC ARE TO THE POINTS YOU

02:01:15.334 --> 02:01:17.470
MENTIONED. THE FIRST POINT IS

02:01:17.536 --> 02:01:19.872
THAT. WHEN IT COMES. YOU AT CDC

02:01:19.939 --> 02:01:22.308
ALL. PARTICULAR THERE SURE ARE

02:01:22.375 --> 02:01:24.610
SOME COURT ORDERED MANDATES.

02:01:24.677 --> 02:01:26.012
THAT WE HAVE TO COMPLY WITH AS

02:01:26.078 --> 02:01:28.180
A STATE YOU KNOW UNDER- UNDER

02:01:28.247 --> 02:01:30.883
THE ORDER OF A JUDGE. SO FOR

02:01:30.950 --> 02:01:32.318
THIS REASON. SOME OF THE

02:01:32.385 --> 02:01:34.754
SPENDING- AND- MADE THE POINT-

02:01:34.820 --> 02:01:36.589
DOESN'T GET REDUCED- THE WAY

02:01:36.656 --> 02:01:38.457
SPENDING IN OTHER CATEGORIES-

02:01:38.524 --> 02:01:40.192
MIGHT. HAVE TO BE REDUCED TO

02:01:40.259 --> 02:01:41.494
BALANCE THE BUDGET. SIMPLY

02:01:41.560 --> 02:01:42.962
BECAUSE OF THESE COURT ORDERED

02:01:43.029 --> 02:01:43.929
MANDATES AND CERTAINLY. THE

02:01:43.996 --> 02:01:44.764
STATE. GOVERNOR THE

02:01:44.830 --> 02:01:46.766
ADMINISTRATION. AGREES WITH YOU

02:01:46.832 --> 02:01:48.300
IT AT. WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING

02:01:48.367 --> 02:01:51.203
WE CAN OVER TIME TO. IMPROVE

02:01:51.270 --> 02:01:52.805
REHAB REHABILITATION- AND

02:01:52.872 --> 02:01:54.674
CONTINUE. DOWN TREND. STATE AND

02:01:54.740 --> 02:01:56.175
POPULATION BUT- I SUPPORT THE

02:01:56.242 --> 02:01:59.311
RIGHT THING TO DO. AND IT SAVES.

02:01:59.378 --> 02:02:00.012
BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING- THAT

02:02:00.079 --> 02:02:02.481
CAN BE DONE. IN JUST ONE YEAR-

02:02:02.548 --> 02:02:04.050
BUT THE SECOND POINT. WHICH YOU

02:02:04.116 --> 02:02:06.152
ALLUDED TO IS. WHEN THE

02:02:06.218 --> 02:02:08.087
GOVERNOR PROPOSED HIS BUDGET IN

02:02:08.154 --> 02:02:10.756
JANUARY. PROPOSED CLOSING. UP

02:02:10.823 --> 02:02:12.658
ONE PRESENT. NOW WITH THE MAY

02:02:12.725 --> 02:02:14.894
REVISION OVER. FIVE YEARS NOW

02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:16.462
THE MAYOR- HE IS ABOUT

02:02:16.529 --> 02:02:17.830
PROPOSING A CURRENT POPULATION

02:02:17.897 --> 02:02:19.665
TRENDS HOLD. THE CLOSER. TO

02:02:19.732 --> 02:02:21.367
PRESIDENTS AND NOW. IT'S

02:02:21.434 --> 02:02:23.202
IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY RIGHT NOW-

02:02:23.269 --> 02:02:24.937
EXACTLY WHAT THE SAVINGS WILL

02:02:25.004 --> 02:02:28.040
BE BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW. WHEN

02:02:28.107 --> 02:02:29.208
THE FACILITIES EXACTLY WILL BE

02:02:29.275 --> 02:02:31.477
CLOSED. THE METS. OR WHAT SIZE

02:02:31.544 --> 02:02:33.312
FACILITY WILL BE CLOSED. THAT'S

02:02:33.379 --> 02:02:35.281
BASED ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT

02:02:35.347 --> 02:02:40.486
FACTORS. I REMEMBER TALKING TO

02:02:40.553 --> 02:02:43.789
CHARGE HIM. WILL FOLLOW UP WITH

02:02:43.856 --> 02:02:46.092
YOU. WHAT IS THE ISSUE. IS

02:02:46.158 --> 02:02:49.929
THAT. I'M GOING STAVING. ONCE

02:02:49.995 --> 02:02:51.564
DISCLOSURE DOES COME TO. PASS

02:02:51.630 --> 02:02:54.567
THAT. OPEN AT. TEN THOSE ARE

02:02:54.633 --> 02:02:56.001
THE SAVINGS THAT WE- HE- AND

02:02:56.068 --> 02:02:58.037
BUDGET FOR THAT CATEGORY. ON

02:02:58.104 --> 02:02:58.804
THE DOES ARE THE TWO MAIN

02:02:58.871 --> 02:03:00.573
POINTS AND I THINK LAST POINT

02:03:00.639 --> 02:03:03.442
IS. YOU MENTION DJJ. AT THAT

02:03:03.509 --> 02:03:04.877
NOW THE- GOAL IS TO. REALIZE

02:03:04.944 --> 02:03:09.348
THAT THE COUNTY. AND I KNOW.

UP THE QUESTION INTO A FEW

02:13:40.278 --> 02:13:40.812
DIFFERENT COMPONENTS FIRST AND

02:13:40.879 --> 02:13:44.983
FOREMOST- THE REASON WHY WE PUT

02:13:45.050 --> 02:13:46.451
THE STATE HOME ORDER CAME

02:13:46.518 --> 02:13:49.321
PLACES THE REASON WHY. WE DON'T

02:13:49.388 --> 02:13:50.922
SEE THE TRENDS THAT WE SEE IN

02:13:50.989 --> 02:13:52.524

REGARDS TO BOTH THE CASE

02:13:55.727 --> 02:13:57.929
POSITIVE ADD TO AND DOES IS

02:13:57.996 --> 02:13:59.931
BECAUSE WE TAKE ACTION-

QUICKLY. AND THE STATE OR

02:14:02.467 --> 02:14:03.402
MORTAR AND THE ACTIONS OF THE

TO DECOMPRESS OUR HEALTHCARE

02:14:10.642 --> 02:14:12.911
DELIVERY SYSTEM SO THAT WE HAVE

02:14:12.978 --> 02:14:14.179
THE ABILITY TO RESPOND. MORE WE

02:14:14.246 --> 02:14:17.149
HAD A LOT. TO PREPARE AND- ONE

02:14:17.215 --> 02:14:18.049
OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE

02:14:18.116 --> 02:14:19.951
LEARNED FROM THIS EXPERIENCE IS

02:14:20.018 --> 02:14:22.954
THAT PEOPLE REALLY DID HEED THE

02:14:23.021 --> 02:14:24.189
ADVICE OF PUBLIC HEALTH

02:14:24.256 --> 02:14:26.458

02:14:34.533 --> 02:14:36.868
REGARD TO AT AMP. SURGE WE ARE

02:14:36.935 --> 02:14:38.203
VERY FOR. THAT WE DIDN'T AFTER

02:14:38.270 --> 02:14:39.638
ACTIVATE ANY TO OF ANSWER CAL.

02:14:39.704 --> 02:14:41.706
THAT NOT MEAN THAT WE MIGHT NOT

02:14:41.773 --> 02:14:43.074
HAVE A SEARCH AS WE BEGIN

02:14:43.141 --> 02:14:45.477
MODIFICATIONS WITH REGARDS TO

02:14:45.544 --> 02:14:46.945
THE STAY AT HOME ORDER WOULD

02:14:47.012 --> 02:14:48.613
TERE ARE A NUMBER OF FACTORS

02:14:48.680 --> 02:14:50.715
DRIVING OUR ABILITY TO TERM AND

02:14:50.782 --> 02:14:52.884
KIND OF WHAT THIS. WHAT THINGS

02:14:52.951 --> 02:14:54.653
OF HOW THINGS WILL LOOK LIKE

02:14:54.719 --> 02:14:55.987
WITH REGARDS TO THE NEXT COUPLE

02:14:56.054 --> 02:14:57.389
OF WEEKS AND ARE MARKED. FIRST

02:14:57.456 --> 02:14:59.658
AND FOREMOST WE DO NOT KNOW AT

02:14:59.724 --> 02:15:01.460
THE SEASONALITY OF THIS VIRUS

02:15:01.526 --> 02:15:03.195
WE MIGHT ASSUME THAT

02:15:03.261 --> 02:15:05.530
TEMPERATURES MIGHT THAT DUE DUE

02:15:05.597 --> 02:15:06.465
TO THE TEMPERATURE CHANGE THE

02:15:06.531 --> 02:15:08.500
BEHAVIOR OF THE VIRUS. WE

02:15:08.567 --> 02:15:10.936
BELIEVE. THERE IS SOME RESEARCH

02:15:11.002 --> 02:15:13.004
SHOWS THAT AT THE VIRUS DOES

02:15:13.071 --> 02:15:14.739
BEHAVE BASED ON TEMPERATURES

02:15:14.806 --> 02:15:16.141
BECAUSE OF ONE COMPONENT OF

THE- CORONAVIRUS WHICH IS A AT

02:15:18.243 --> 02:15:20.278
THE COMMON COLD. BEHAVE THAT

02:15:20.345 --> 02:15:22.380
WAY NOW- WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER

02:15:22.447 --> 02:15:23.648
THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS WILL

02:15:23.715 --> 02:15:25.283
BEHAVE THAT WAY. OTHER

02:15:25.350 --> 02:15:26.351
COMPONENTS THAT WE HAVE TO

02:15:26.418 --> 02:15:28.353
THINK ABOUT AS WE BEGIN TO LOOK

02:15:28.420 --> 02:15:30.555
AT- THE MODIFICATIONS TO THE

02:15:30.622 --> 02:15:31.857
STATE HOME ORDERED A POTENTIAL

02:15:31.923 --> 02:15:33.692
SEARCH EITHER IN THE FALL OR IN

02:15:33.758 --> 02:15:35.227
THE COMING WEEKS. IS HOW

02:15:35.293 --> 02:15:36.194
INDIVIDUAL BEHAVIOR MIGHT

02:15:36.261 --> 02:15:38.029
CHANGE. AS WE MAKE THESE

THEY TAKE. A NAP COUPLE. MAKE

02:15:56.615 --> 02:16:00.218
THE- ASIAN WE MIGHT HAVE SAID

02:16:00.285 --> 02:16:02.521

02:16:55.774 --> 02:16:56.241
THE CHAIR AND VICE CHAIRS

02:16:56.308 --> 02:16:58.843
COMMENTS ABOUT. THE LEGISLATIVE

02:16:58.910 --> 02:17:01.012
OVERSIGHT I JUST WANNA. WHY DO

02:17:01.079 --> 02:17:02.781
YOU WHY DO YOU FEEL THE NEED

02:17:02.847 --> 02:17:04.516
THAT YOU WANT TO BE THE-

02:17:04.583 --> 02:17:05.817
DECISION MAKER OF. OF

02:17:05.884 --> 02:17:07.819
ALLOCATING THE FEDERAL DOLLARS

02:17:07.886 --> 02:17:18.630
THAT MAY COME IN. ON THAT

02:17:18.697 --> 02:17:20.799
QUESTION WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO

02:17:20.865 --> 02:17:22.634
ENGAGE WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND

02:17:22.701 --> 02:17:23.401
CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH THE

02:17:23.468 --> 02:17:25.704
PROCESS I THINK- WHAT YOU'RE

02:17:25.770 --> 02:17:27.672
GOING TO A SPECIFIC-

02:17:27.739 --> 02:17:28.640
FLEXIBILITY THAT WE ARE

02:17:28.707 --> 02:17:31.109
REQUESTING. WHEN IT COMES TO-

02:17:31.176 --> 02:17:32.777
EMERGENCY AUTHORITY AND YOU

02:17:32.844 --> 02:17:33.812
KNOW WE ARE I'VE BEEN AN

02:17:33.878 --> 02:17:36.081
EMERGENCY- SINCE THE GOVERNOR

02:17:36.147 --> 02:17:37.349
AND MADE HIS DECLARATION OF

02:17:37.415 --> 02:17:39.384
EMERGENCY AND I THINK WHAT THIS

02:17:39.451 --> 02:17:41.987
VIRUS- MY COLLEAGUE MARCO WAS

02:17:42.053 --> 02:17:43.755
DISCUSSING THE DIFFERENT MODELS

02:17:43.822 --> 02:17:45.023
AND- HOW WE THINK ABOUT IT BUT

02:17:45.090 --> 02:17:46.658
ONE THING THAT WE DO KNOW. IS

02:17:46.725 --> 02:17:48.193
THAT THIS CAN CHANGE VERY

02:17:48.259 --> 02:17:49.661
QUICKLY AND WE'VE CERTAINLY

02:17:49.728 --> 02:17:51.730
SEEN THAT DIVERSITY OF OUT

02:17:51.796 --> 02:17:53.431
TIMES EVEN WITHIN THE UNITED

02:17:53.498 --> 02:17:56.234
STATES FROM STATE TO STATE AND

02:17:56.301 --> 02:17:57.102
THAT THE GOVERNOR'S MOVING VRY

02:17:57.168 --> 02:17:59.204
CAREFULLY AND DISCIPLINED WAY.

02:17:59.270 --> 02:18:01.740
COMES TO RE OPENING THE ECONOMY

02:18:01.806 --> 02:18:02.874
BUT WE'RE ALL OF US DID BY WHAT

02:18:02.941 --> 02:18:05.076
OTHER STATES IN THE US DO. AND

02:18:05.143 --> 02:18:07.178
WE'RE ALSO AFFECTED BY UNKNOWNS

02:18:07.245 --> 02:18:08.847
WHEN IT COMES TO THIS VIRUS SO

02:18:08.913 --> 02:18:09.581
THE REASON THAT WE'RE

02:18:09.648 --> 02:18:14.252
REQUESTING THE FLEXIBILITY. IS

02:18:14.319 --> 02:18:14.953
SO THAT THE STATE CAN. IF YOU

02:18:15.020 --> 02:18:16.054
HAVE TO AND THAT SUMMER AND

02:18:16.121 --> 02:18:17.889
FALL. IN PER YEAR AWAY IF THE

02:18:17.956 --> 02:18:20.158
WATCHED. IS OUT OF SESSION OR

02:18:20.225 --> 02:18:21.559
OTHERWISE CANNOT ACT IN A VERY

02:18:21.626 --> 02:18:23.495
QUICK MANNER BUT WE UNDERSTAND

02:18:23.561 --> 02:18:25.597
THE IMPORTANCE OF ENGAGEMENT-

02:18:25.664 --> 02:18:27.032
AND CLEAR NOTIFICATION AND

02:18:27.098 --> 02:18:28.900
WERE. CONTINUING TO IMPROVE OUR

02:18:28.967 --> 02:18:30.635
PROCESSES WHEN IT COMES TO THAT

02:18:30.702 --> 02:18:32.137
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY.

02:18:32.203 --> 02:18:33.638
WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE TO PUT

02:18:33.705 --> 02:18:34.706
OUT THAT WHETHER WE KNOW CAME

02:18:34.773 --> 02:18:36.474
LATE LAST NIGHT. BUT DECLARE

02:18:36.541 --> 02:18:38.043
FIRE EXPENDITURES SO THAT

02:18:38.109 --> 02:18:39.144
PEOPLE WOULD HAVE THE

02:18:39.210 --> 02:18:40.679
OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THAT.

02:18:40.745 --> 02:18:42.580
EVEN BEFORE THIS HEARING TODAY

02:18:42.647 --> 02:18:43.982
AS WELL AS HEADING INTO NEXT

02:18:44.049 --> 02:18:46.384
WEEK SO I KNOW WE'RE ALL TRYING

02:18:46.451 --> 02:18:47.952
TO GET THE BALANCE RIGHT. BUT I

02:18:48.019 --> 02:18:48.853
THINK THE GOVERNOR AND THE

02:18:48.920 --> 02:18:50.655
ADMINISTRATION- ALSO DO FEEL

02:18:50.722 --> 02:18:52.757
VERY STRONGLY THAT. THERE NEEDS

02:18:52.824 --> 02:18:54.492
TO BE SOME PROVISION IF THERE

02:18:54.559 --> 02:18:56.828
IS A RESURGENCE OR NEED TO STEP

02:18:56.895 --> 02:18:58.663
UP HOSPITALS ARE AGAIN. THAT WE

02:18:58.730 --> 02:18:59.998
HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO DO THAT

02:19:00.065 --> 02:19:01.533
VERY QUICKLY BECAUSE THAT IS A

02:19:01.599 --> 02:19:02.701
CORE FUNCTION OF GOVERNMENT IN

02:19:02.767 --> 02:19:06.104

BRIEFING THERE WAS NO- IT'LL

02:21:02.754 --> 02:21:04.455
IT'S IT WAS THAT WE WERE

02:21:04.522 --> 02:21:06.558
DIFFICULT TO REACH WERE WE

02:21:06.624 --> 02:21:11.863
UNAVAILABLE. PERHAPS YOU WERE

02:21:11.930 --> 02:21:16.534
BUSY. YES MISTER KING I THINK-

02:21:16.601 --> 02:21:19.504
WE WERE- FINALIZING AT TWO

02:21:19.571 --> 02:21:20.705
BECAUSE THE SITUATION IS

02:21:20.772 --> 02:21:23.441
CHANGING ON A DAILY BASIS- THIS

02:21:23.508 --> 02:21:24.576
WAS PART OF UPDATING OUR

02:21:24.642 --> 02:21:26.945
ESTIMATES FOR THE NAY REVISION

02:21:27.011 --> 02:21:28.513
AND CLARIFYING THEM AND PUTTING

02:21:28.580 --> 02:21:29.981
THEM INTO A FORMAT THAT WE

02:21:30.048 --> 02:21:31.082
COULD SHARE WITH THE

02:21:31.149 --> 02:21:33.518
LEGISLATURE AND SO WE- AND I

02:21:33.585 --> 02:21:35.220
CAN CONFIRM THIS WE DID NOT

02:21:35.286 --> 02:21:37.956
FINALIZE WHAT WE SHARED- LAST

02:21:38.022 --> 02:21:40.024
NIGHT AND TOLD VERY SHORTLY-

02:21:40.091 --> 02:21:41.926
BEFORE WE DID SHARE IT- WE HAD

02:21:41.993 --> 02:21:44.229
A CALL. WITH LEGISLATIVE STAFF

02:21:44.295 --> 02:21:47.198
OUT BEFORE WE ACTUALLY- SHARE

02:21:47.265 --> 02:21:48.199
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN WALK

02:21:48.266 --> 02:21:50.134
THEM THROUGH- SOME OF THE KEY

02:21:50.201 --> 02:21:52.270
PROVISIONS SO WE UNDERSTAND

02:21:52.337 --> 02:21:53.705
THIS IS A VERY FLUID SITUATION

02:21:53.771 --> 02:21:55.406
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO.

02:21:55.473 --> 02:21:57.208
IMPROVE AT AND FOR THE LEVEL OF

02:21:57.275 --> 02:21:59.277
COMMUNICATION BUT WE DID SHARE

02:21:59.344 --> 02:22:02.247
THAT AS SOON AS IT WAS READY. I

02:22:02.313 --> 02:22:03.181
JUST WANT TO CLARIFY A POINT

02:22:03.248 --> 02:22:06.084
AND- MY COLLEAGUES TO CORRECT

02:22:06.150 --> 02:22:08.553
ME IF I'M WRONG- BLOODLUST

02:22:08.620 --> 02:22:09.487
CHECKED IT CONSTITUTION

02:22:09.554 --> 02:22:12.757
LEGISLATIVE STAFF TO SUBSTITUTE

02:22:12.824 --> 02:22:17.195
IT JUST TORE. SO ARE. BIG

02:22:17.262 --> 02:22:19.230
DIFFERENCE TELLING ME SOMETHING

02:22:19.297 --> 02:22:20.265
PERSIST HAULING MY STAFF

02:22:20.331 --> 02:22:26.571
SOMETHING. SO THERE WAS NO

02:22:26.638 --> 02:22:29.774
CALIFORNIA AND THAT ELECTED ANY

02:22:29.841 --> 02:22:31.576
ONE OF MY STAFF MEMBERS LAST I

02:22:31.643 --> 02:22:37.382
CHECKED. SO AGAIN YOU HAVE

02:22:37.448 --> 02:22:39.717
CURRENT YOUR REVISIONS AND

02:22:39.784 --> 02:22:42.353
RATHER THAN CALL US HOW THE

02:22:42.420 --> 02:22:44.923
MEETING DISCUSS IT WITH US YOU

02:22:44.989 --> 02:22:47.525
SENT A FORMAL LETTER. IS THIS

02:22:47.592 --> 02:22:49.460
THE CAN IS THIS THIS IS THE

02:22:49.527 --> 02:22:50.828
PATTERN THAT YOU CONTINUE TO.

02:22:50.895 --> 02:22:52.430
ANTICIPATE ACTING DURING THIS

02:22:52.497 --> 02:22:54.799
PANDEMIC AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW

02:22:54.866 --> 02:22:55.366
LONG THIS PANDEMICS GONNA GO

02:22:55.433 --> 02:22:57.568
FOR COULD BE. TWO THREE YEARS.

02:22:57.635 --> 02:22:59.570
WE COULD BE LIVING AGAIN IN A

02:22:59.637 --> 02:23:01.105
POST COVERT NINETEEN PERIOD

02:23:01.172 --> 02:23:04.542
FOREVER. AS ALL THE MEDICAL

02:23:04.609 --> 02:23:06.678
DOCTORS HAVE TALKED ABOUT

02:23:06.744 --> 02:23:07.245
THERE'S THIS DISEASE IS NOT

02:23:07.312 --> 02:23:11.215
GOING AWAY. SO IS THIS HOW THE

02:23:11.282 --> 02:23:12.617
ADMINISTRATION PLANS TO

02:23:12.684 --> 02:23:15.787
CONTINUE OPERATE. DURING THIS

02:23:15.853 --> 02:23:18.957
COVER NINETY WHICH COULD BE FOR

02:23:19.023 --> 02:23:21.459
THE REST OF THE PERIOD OF THIS

02:23:21.526 --> 02:23:25.830
ADMINISTRATION'S EXISTENCE. I

02:23:25.897 --> 02:23:27.699
THINK WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT WE

02:23:27.765 --> 02:23:29.233
WILL CONTINUE TO SHARE AS MUCH

02:23:29.300 --> 02:23:30.802
INFORMATION AS WE CAN AS

02:23:30.868 --> 02:23:32.704
QUICKLY AS WE CAN AND- AND I

02:23:32.770 --> 02:23:33.805
KNOW WE WERE WORKING ON

02:23:33.871 --> 02:23:36.174
FINALIZING THIS INFORMATION ON

02:23:36.240 --> 02:23:38.209
WHICH HAS BEEN UPDATED SINCE WE

02:23:38.276 --> 02:23:39.610
WERE ALL TOGETHER LAST MONTH

02:23:39.677 --> 02:23:41.512
WHEN WE INITIALLY PROJECTED A

02:23:41.579 --> 02:23:42.714
SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR

02:23:42.780 --> 02:23:44.582
EXPENDITURE- BUT I HEAR YOUR

02:23:44.649 --> 02:23:45.917
FEEDBACK MISTER TECH AND I'LL

02:23:45.984 --> 02:23:46.884
MAKE SURE TO SHARE IT WITH. A

02:23:46.951 --> 02:23:48.419
MENTAL IMAGES CLEAR BECAUSE I

02:23:48.486 --> 02:23:50.355
THOUGHT THIS DISCUSSION WITH MY

02:23:50.421 --> 02:23:53.224
STAFFAS WELL JUST BECAUSE YOU

02:23:53.291 --> 02:23:55.927
HIT SEND. IN AN EMAIL. THE

02:23:55.994 --> 02:24:00.565
ACCOUNT HAS INFORMING ME. SO

02:24:00.631 --> 02:24:01.933
YOUR IDEA OF COMMUNICATION IS

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:03.868
SENDING ME A FORM LETTER VIA

02:24:03.935 --> 02:24:08.172
EMAIL. THAT'S NOT COMMUNICATION

02:24:08.239 --> 02:24:09.741
I HOPE THAT'S NOT HOW PEOPLE

02:24:09.807 --> 02:24:10.375
COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR FAMILY

02:24:10.441 --> 02:24:12.276
MEMBERS IT'S DEFINITELY NOT HOW

02:24:12.343 --> 02:24:14.112
WE ONLY COMMUNICATE WITH OUR

02:24:14.178 --> 02:24:15.546
CONSTITUENTS OTHERWISE WE'D ALL

02:24:15.613 --> 02:24:21.085
BE FIRED. SO SENDING A LETTER

02:24:21.152 --> 02:24:22.420
DOES NOT CONSTITUTE

02:24:22.487 --> 02:24:27.925
COMMUNICATION. SO AGAIN. THIS

02:24:27.992 --> 02:24:29.527
PANDEMIC JUST LIKE I OUTLINED

02:24:29.594 --> 02:24:31.562
JUST LIKE WE HAVE HEART DISEASE

02:24:31.629 --> 02:24:33.865
JUST LIKE WE HAVE CANCER WILL

02:24:33.931 --> 02:24:35.333
BE PROBABLY BE HERE FOR THE

02:24:35.400 --> 02:24:38.703
NEXT. SIX PLUS YEARS OF THIS

02:24:38.770 --> 02:24:39.570
ADMINISTRATION'S EXISTENCE

02:24:39.637 --> 02:24:41.272
SHOULD THIS. TO THE GOVERNOR

02:24:41.339 --> 02:24:43.374
AND I JUST PITIFULLY WILL BE

02:24:43.441 --> 02:24:47.378
REELECTED. IS THIS HOW THE

02:24:47.445 --> 02:24:50.014
ADMINISTRATION. PLANS TO

02:24:50.081 --> 02:24:53.084
CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN A COVERT

02:24:53.151 --> 02:24:56.754
NINETEEN. BECAUSE NOTHING THAT

02:24:56.821 --> 02:24:57.789
WAS BROUGHT FORWARD EITHER IN

02:24:57.855 --> 02:24:59.924
THE LETTER WHEN THE MAY REVISE

02:24:59.991 --> 02:25:03.461
OR IN YOUR COMMUNICATION HAS.

02:25:03.528 --> 02:25:04.962
PUT FORWARD THAT WE WERE GOING

02:25:05.029 --> 02:25:08.599
TO CHANGE OUR- PRACTICES WE GET

02:25:08.666 --> 02:25:11.402
A LOT OF WE HEAR YOU BUT I'LL

02:25:11.469 --> 02:25:13.704
JUST SAY EVEN AS OF LAST WEEK.

02:25:13.771 --> 02:25:15.273
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS

02:25:15.339 --> 02:25:20.378
REFUSED TO MEET WITH ME. I WAS

02:25:20.445 --> 02:25:22.513
I HAD A GROUP MEETING REQUEST

02:25:22.580 --> 02:25:23.915
WHICH WAS TURNED DOWN BECAUSE

02:25:23.981 --> 02:25:26.451
PEOPLE WERE TOO BUSY. AND I'M A

02:25:26.517 --> 02:25:27.852
LITTLE BIT SURPRISED BECAUSE I

02:25:27.919 --> 02:25:28.486
THOUGHT I WAS A BUSINESS PERSON

02:25:28.553 --> 02:25:32.523
THIS BILL. SO COULD YOU ANSWER

02:25:32.590 --> 02:25:37.595
MY QUESTION. WHEN IT COMES TO

02:25:37.662 --> 02:25:38.830
THIS SPECIFIC MEETING REQUESTS

02:25:38.896 --> 02:25:40.631
I WILL MAKE SURE TO CHECK OUT

02:25:40.698 --> 02:25:42.500
NUMBER DURING THE MEETING

02:25:42.567 --> 02:25:43.067
BECAUSE THE MIDDLE CLASS IS

02:25:43.134 --> 02:25:45.303
TAKING CARE OF. IS THIS HOW THE

02:25:45.369 --> 02:25:50.074
ADMINISTRATION PLANS TO OPERATE.

02:25:50.141 --> 02:25:51.642
DURING THIS CALL THE NINETEEN

02:25:51.709 --> 02:25:53.177
PERIOD WHICH COULD LAST FOR THE

02:25:53.244 --> 02:25:57.482
NEXT SIX PLUS YEARS. I THINK

02:25:57.548 --> 02:25:59.317
WHEN IT COMES TO THAT WHAT IT

02:25:59.383 --> 02:26:02.186
WAS YESTERDAY ANSWER. BUT WE

02:26:02.253 --> 02:26:03.454
ARE WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO

02:26:03.521 --> 02:26:05.756
IMPROVE- AND SEE THE BEST WAY

02:26:05.823 --> 02:26:06.657
TO MAKE IT WITH YOU I WILL SAY

02:26:06.724 --> 02:26:08.392
THAT- THE LETTER THAT WE SENT

02:26:08.459 --> 02:26:10.561
YESTERDAY I GOT AN ABSOLUTELY

02:26:10.628 --> 02:26:12.463
UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT THAT. A

02:26:12.530 --> 02:26:13.197
LETTER IS NOT FULL

02:26:13.264 --> 02:26:15.800
COMMUNICATION BUT WE WORK VERY

02:26:15.867 --> 02:26:16.868
HARD TO STRUCTURE A TO MAKE

02:26:16.934 --> 02:26:18.903
SURE THAT ALL THE INFORMATION

02:26:18.970 --> 02:26:21.239
THAT WE HAD AVAILABLE TO SHARE-

02:26:21.305 --> 02:26:22.440
WAS IN THAT WRITER LETTER BUT I

02:26:22.507 --> 02:26:25.676
UNDERSTAND. WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

02:26:25.743 --> 02:26:26.210
AND I'M GONNA MAKE SURE TO

02:26:26.277 --> 02:26:27.211
SHARE WITH MY COLLEAGUES.

02:26:27.278 --> 02:26:30.548
DEPRECIATE THAT SO WITH AGAIN

02:26:30.615 --> 02:26:35.720
WE HAVE A PANDEMIC. THAT.

02:26:35.786 --> 02:26:37.788
TOUCHES EVERY CALIFORNIA

02:26:37.855 --> 02:26:41.759
TOUCHES EVERY PART OF THE STATE.

02:26:41.826 --> 02:26:44.428
SO I THINK WHAT WHAT WE NEED TO

02:26:44.495 --> 02:26:48.933
SEE IS. LATER LIMITATIONS TO

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:52.803
PARAMETERS I THINK IT MAKES

02:26:52.870 --> 02:26:56.207
SENSE FOR THE GOVERNOR TO HAVE

02:26:56.274 --> 02:26:58.543
A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF AUTHORITY

02:26:58.609 --> 02:26:59.877
TO SPEND FEDERAL FUNDING

02:26:59.944 --> 02:27:01.612
ESPECIALLY FOR FUNDING THAT

02:27:01.679 --> 02:27:05.149
WILL BE REIMBURSED FROM FEVER

02:27:05.216 --> 02:27:07.618
THERE THERE WAS- A NUMBER OF

02:27:07.685 --> 02:27:09.220
NOT A NUMBER BUT THEY WERE

02:27:09.287 --> 02:27:10.054
DEFINITELY EXPENDITURES DURING

02:27:10.121 --> 02:27:13.624
THIS PERIOD WHICH- WERE NOT.

02:27:13.691 --> 02:27:17.895
REIMBURSED BY FEMA. BUT WORK IN

02:27:17.962 --> 02:27:20.064
MY OPINION REGULAR BUDGET

02:27:20.131 --> 02:27:21.566
EXPENDITURES YET THE

02:27:21.632 --> 02:27:23.901
LEGISLATURE WAS NOT CONSULTED-

02:27:23.968 --> 02:27:26.237
WAS NOT ADVISE SO WHAT WHAT I

02:27:26.304 --> 02:27:26.837
SAY THE LEGISLATURE TO DOESN'T

02:27:26.904 --> 02:27:30.041
MEAN THAT. A LEGISLATING FOR

02:27:30.107 --> 02:27:33.578
WAS NOT TALK TO. WE HAVE A

02:27:33.644 --> 02:27:34.679
PROCESS WE HAVE A LEADERSHIP

02:27:34.745 --> 02:27:36.247
PROCESS WE HAVE A COMMITTEE

02:27:36.314 --> 02:27:39.317
PROCESS SO TALKING TO ALL ONE

02:27:39.383 --> 02:27:40.518
LEGISLATOR TALKING TO

02:27:40.585 --> 02:27:42.687
LEGISLATORS DOES NOT IN MY

02:27:42.753 --> 02:27:44.956
OPINION CONSTITUTE. ALSO TATIAN

02:27:45.022 --> 02:27:46.390
THERE WE HAVE A SPECIFIC

02:27:46.457 --> 02:27:48.059
PROCESS OF OUR CONSULTATION.

02:27:48.125 --> 02:27:50.094
MEANS THROUGH OUR GOVERNMENTAL

02:27:50.161 --> 02:27:54.632
HISTORY. SO YOU KNOW I THINK

02:27:54.699 --> 02:27:58.035
WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO SEE IS-

02:27:58.102 --> 02:28:00.104
A LOT MORE SPECIFICS IN TERMS

02:28:00.171 --> 02:28:05.743
OF. WHAT YOU NEED- AUTHORITY

02:28:05.810 --> 02:28:09.180
FOR. BECAUSE THE WAY THIS-

02:28:09.247 --> 02:28:11.315
EMERGENCY SPECIFIED YOU COULD

02:28:11.382 --> 02:28:13.317
SPEND MONEY ON ANYTHING TO DO

02:28:13.384 --> 02:28:15.386
WHATEVER YOU WANT AND JUSTIFY

02:28:15.453 --> 02:28:17.622
THAT IT HAS AN IMPACT ON ANY

02:28:17.688 --> 02:28:20.224
NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS. DURING

02:28:20.291 --> 02:28:22.326
THIS PANDEMIC WHICH AGAIN THE

02:28:22.393 --> 02:28:24.695
STATE EMERGENCY COULD LAST FOR

02:28:24.762 --> 02:28:27.732
SIX YEARS OR MORE. CITY YOUR

02:28:27.798 --> 02:28:29.967
THOUGHTS ABOUT HOW YOU COULD

02:28:30.034 --> 02:28:31.402
ELIMINATE BECAUSE OF THE TO

02:28:31.469 --> 02:28:33.804
NARROW THE EXPENDITURES BECAUSE

02:28:33.871 --> 02:28:35.439
ALL I'LL SAY THIS WHEN WE- THE

02:28:35.506 --> 02:28:36.474
BILL I BELIEVE ON MARCH

02:28:36.540 --> 02:28:37.875
SIXTEENTH WHEN WE LEFT THE

02:28:37.942 --> 02:28:40.911
IDEAL WAS. AND THE WAY THAT IT

02:28:40.978 --> 02:28:43.147
WAS PROPOSED TO US. WITH THAT

02:28:43.214 --> 02:28:44.482
THE EXPENDITURES WERE GOING TO

02:28:44.548 --> 02:28:47.051
BE LIMITED TO AGAIN YEAH HEALTH

02:28:47.118 --> 02:28:49.086
AND PUBLIC SAFETY SO IN OUR

02:28:49.153 --> 02:28:51.856
MINDS IT WAS YOU KNOW PP.

02:28:51.922 --> 02:28:54.759
HOSPITAL ROOMS. YOU KNOW PEOPLE

02:28:54.825 --> 02:28:55.593
FIVE GETTING PEOPLE OFF THE

02:28:55.660 --> 02:28:58.229
STREET. SO AGAIN I DON'T THINK

02:28:58.296 --> 02:29:01.032
ANYBODY- YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE

02:29:01.098 --> 02:29:02.967
DOING OUR PROPER OVERSIGHT OVER

02:29:03.034 --> 02:29:04.735
SOME OF THESE CONTRACTS. I

02:29:04.802 --> 02:29:05.469
DON'T THINK ANYBODY IS

02:29:05.536 --> 02:29:07.605
DISPUTING THE FACT THAT THE

02:29:07.672 --> 02:29:09.006
GOVERNOR NEEDED TO TAKE A

02:29:09.073 --> 02:29:11.475
CREDIBLE LEADERSHIP THAT WE

02:29:11.542 --> 02:29:13.744
ASK. YOU KNOW WE- ARE NEED

02:29:13.811 --> 02:29:15.413
NEEDED TO GO AFTER PP AND I

02:29:15.479 --> 02:29:16.981
UNDERSTAND THAT IT WAS VERY

02:29:17.048 --> 02:29:18.182
CHALLENGING CHALLENGING TIMES

02:29:18.249 --> 02:29:20.284
AND NO ONE'S. NOT NO WONDER SIR

02:29:20.351 --> 02:29:23.521
CORRECTING THAT ISSUE- FOR THE

02:29:23.587 --> 02:29:24.355
GOVERNOR DID MADE IT YOU KNOW I

02:29:24.422 --> 02:29:26.157
THINK EVERYTHING HE DID I

02:29:26.223 --> 02:29:28.659
PERSONALLY AGREE WITH. THE

02:29:28.726 --> 02:29:33.331
PROCESS IN WHICH IT WAS DONE. I

02:29:33.397 --> 02:29:36.600
THINK WAS VERY CONCERNING. SO

02:29:36.667 --> 02:29:38.235
AGAIN AGAIN KNOWING THAT WE MAY

02:29:38.302 --> 02:29:42.006
BE IN THIS STATE FOR A WHILE.

02:29:42.073 --> 02:29:43.908
IT CAN NOW- COVE IN NINETEEN.

02:29:43.974 --> 02:29:46.677
SITUATION IS TO ME BECOMING

02:29:46.744 --> 02:29:49.313
MORE SIMILAR TO. HEART DISEASE

02:29:49.380 --> 02:29:51.682
AND CANCER WHICH ARE ALSO A

02:29:51.749 --> 02:29:53.351
MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES THAT

02:29:53.417 --> 02:29:56.687
WE HAVE TO HAVE TO LIVE WITH.

02:29:56.754 --> 02:29:58.356
WHAT WHAT THINKING HAS BEEN

02:29:58.422 --> 02:30:04.195
DONE TO. PERHAPS PROPOSED OR TO

02:30:04.261 --> 02:30:05.863
CREATE A GREATER SCOPE

02:30:05.930 --> 02:30:10.501
LIMITATION. YEAH I'LL MAKE TWO

02:30:10.568 --> 02:30:12.436
POINTS- ON THAT AND HAPPY TO

02:30:12.503 --> 02:30:14.038
ADDRESS ANY FOLLOW UP SERVE

02:30:14.105 --> 02:30:15.005
THEIR PARTS OF THE QUESTION

02:30:15.072 --> 02:30:16.474
THAT I DIDN'T GET TO SUFFICIENT

02:30:16.540 --> 02:30:18.275
WEIGHT I THINK THE FIRST IS

02:30:18.342 --> 02:30:20.478
THAT WE VERY MUCH WANTED TO DO

02:30:20.544 --> 02:30:22.446
OUR BEST ESTIMATE WITH THE

02:30:22.513 --> 02:30:23.781
NEIGHBOR VISION AND HEADING

02:30:23.848 --> 02:30:25.516
INTO THIS ONE NOT TO WEAR THE

02:30:25.583 --> 02:30:27.184
LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR

02:30:27.251 --> 02:30:28.853
FINALIZE THE BUDGET WE KNOW

02:30:28.919 --> 02:30:31.122
THAT THAT NUMBER WILL CHANGE-

02:30:31.188 --> 02:30:32.623
BUT WE THOUGHT IT'S IMPORTANT-

02:30:32.690 --> 02:30:34.425
GIVING AT THAT PRIVACY OF THE

02:30:34.492 --> 02:30:36.160
BUDGET PROCESS- THAT WHEN IT

02:30:36.227 --> 02:30:37.895
COMES TO WHAT WE EXPECTED THAT

02:30:37.962 --> 02:30:40.631
GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURE TO BE-

02:30:40.698 --> 02:30:41.232
THAT THAT CAN BE DISCUSSED AND

02:30:41.298 --> 02:30:42.700
DEBATED THROUGH THIS BUDGET

02:30:42.767 --> 02:30:44.735
PROCESS INCLUDING HEARINGS LIKE

02:30:44.802 --> 02:30:46.804
THIS AND SO THAT'S WHY. WE'VE

02:30:46.871 --> 02:30:47.872
BEEN WORKING UP TO THE MAYOR

02:30:47.938 --> 02:30:49.573
AND THEN OVER THE LAST SEVERAL

02:30:49.640 --> 02:30:51.041
USED TO CLARIFY AS BEST WE CAN

02:30:51.108 --> 02:30:52.810
THOSE EXPENDITURES THE SECOND

02:30:52.877 --> 02:30:55.312
POINT IS WHEN IT COMES TO THIS

02:30:55.379 --> 02:30:56.947
EXPENDITURES IN THE BUDGET YEAR

02:30:57.014 --> 02:31:00.317
THIS COMING YEAR- I THINK WE-

02:31:00.384 --> 02:31:01.886
BELIEVE THAT THAT IF THE

02:31:01.952 --> 02:31:03.621
LEGISLATURE IS IN SESSION AND

02:31:03.687 --> 02:31:04.755
WE'RE CERTAINLY HOPING THAT

02:31:04.822 --> 02:31:07.124
TRENDS WILL CONTINUE- WHERE

02:31:07.191 --> 02:31:08.058
THERE WON'T BE A RESURGENCE

02:31:08.125 --> 02:31:10.761
LIKE- LIKE YOU SOME PEOPLE FEAR

02:31:10.828 --> 02:31:12.296
THAT THESE THINGS CAN WORK

02:31:12.363 --> 02:31:13.697
THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS

02:31:13.764 --> 02:31:14.899
THROUGH THE COMMITTEE PROCESS

02:31:14.965 --> 02:31:17.601
EXCEPT THAT THESE EXPENDITURES

02:31:17.668 --> 02:31:18.702
ARE PREDICTABLE AND I KNOW

02:31:18.769 --> 02:31:20.805
MISTER CHAIR YOU MADE AND IT'S

02:31:20.871 --> 02:31:21.939
ALL DUE TO HEART DISEASE. OR

02:31:22.006 --> 02:31:24.275
CANCER AND OF COURSE- AT ALL

02:31:24.341 --> 02:31:26.076
NOW- THESE ARE CHANGING ALL

02:31:26.143 --> 02:31:28.012
SORTS OF WAYS BUT I IMAGINE

02:31:28.078 --> 02:31:29.213
THAT I WANT TO SPEAK TOO FAR

02:31:29.280 --> 02:31:30.347
OUT OF TURN THAT THERE IS A

02:31:30.414 --> 02:31:32.883
SOMEWHAT PREDICTABLE PATH IN

02:31:32.950 --> 02:31:33.517
TERMS OF NUMBER OF DEATHS FROM

02:31:33.584 --> 02:31:35.119
YEAR TO YEAR AND NOT

02:31:35.186 --> 02:31:36.754
NECESSARILY A SIGNIFICANT

02:31:36.821 --> 02:31:38.789
DEGREE AT VARIANCE WITH COLBERT

02:31:38.856 --> 02:31:40.124
NINETEEN THE TRUTH IS I THINK

02:31:40.191 --> 02:31:42.393
THAT PREDICTABILITY- IS NOT

02:31:42.460 --> 02:31:44.728
KNOWN YET BECAUSE SO MUCH OF

02:31:44.795 --> 02:31:45.663
THE VIRUSES ON DOWN SO YOU CAN

02:31:45.729 --> 02:31:47.698
HAVE ONE TEN THE DEBTS OF

02:31:47.765 --> 02:31:48.866
COVERT NINETEEN NEXT YEAR THAT

02:31:48.933 --> 02:31:50.468
WE HAVE THIS YEAR YOU COULD

02:31:50.534 --> 02:31:52.703
HAVE TEN TIMES THAT NUMBER NEXT

02:31:52.770 --> 02:31:54.138
YEAR COMPARED TO YOURS AND SO

02:31:54.205 --> 02:31:55.306
THAT. WERE WORRIED ABOUT THAT'S

02:31:55.372 --> 02:31:57.475
WHAT KEEPS US UP AT NIGHT SO TO

02:31:57.541 --> 02:31:59.009
THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN WORK

02:31:59.076 --> 02:32:00.845
WITH THAT AT BROUGH LEGISLATIVE

02:32:00.911 --> 02:32:02.279
PROCESS OF COURSE THEN THERE

02:32:02.346 --> 02:32:04.348
ISN'T A NEED TO RESORT TO ADD

02:32:04.415 --> 02:32:06.851
EXTRA FINDING OUT BEYOND- WHAT

02:32:06.917 --> 02:32:12.690
WE'RE LOOKING. AT A PROPOSED IN

02:32:12.756 --> 02:32:13.657
JUST BY. AND THE ONLY. THAT WE

02:32:57.268 --> 02:32:58.202
COLLEAGUES THAT I'VE HEARD THAT

02:32:58.269 --> 02:33:01.672
HAVE BEEN. RETICENT TO. AGAIN

02:33:01.739 --> 02:33:03.741
SERVE THEIR DUTY WHEN CALLED

02:33:03.807 --> 02:33:07.144
UPON- HAVING SAID THAT THERE IS

02:33:07.211 --> 02:33:08.245
A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF.

02:33:08.312 --> 02:33:11.849
CONCERN REGARDING THE- BLANKET

02:33:11.916 --> 02:33:14.485
AUTHORITY THAT IS BEING ASKED

02:33:14.552 --> 02:33:19.823
ABOUT- AND I AND I DO- I WOULD.

02:33:19.890 --> 02:33:24.695
ARGUE AGAIN- IF YOU TALK TO THE

02:33:24.762 --> 02:33:26.864
DOCTORS. THIS IS A CORONAVIRUS

02:33:26.931 --> 02:33:28.465
CORONAVIRUSES HAD BEEN VERY

02:33:28.532 --> 02:33:30.434
PREVALENT THROUGHOUT- FOR QUITE

02:33:30.501 --> 02:33:36.574
AWHILE AGAIN THE SIZE OF THE

02:33:36.640 --> 02:33:38.909
CRIME VIRUS AND THE-

02:33:38.976 --> 02:33:41.145
TRANSMISSION IS VERY DIFFERENT

02:33:41.211 --> 02:33:43.147
AND ALSO THE IMPACT THE

02:33:43.213 --> 02:33:46.650
POTENTIAL IMPACT ON PEOPLE. BUT

02:33:46.717 --> 02:33:48.619
MY ESTIMATION JUST LIKE WITH

02:33:48.686 --> 02:33:51.655
ANYTHING ELSE IS THAT- WE WILL

02:33:51.722 --> 02:33:53.691
BE WE NOW THAT WE'VE BEEN IN

02:33:53.757 --> 02:33:56.894
THIS FOR A FEW MONTHS- WE CAN

02:33:56.961 --> 02:33:59.730
ANTICIPATE I WOULD SAY ABOUT

02:33:59.797 --> 02:34:00.264
80% OF WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE

02:34:00.331 --> 02:34:04.602
DOING. IN TERMS OF VENTILATORS

02:34:04.668 --> 02:34:07.037
PP E. HOSPITAL ROOMS HOW WE

02:34:07.104 --> 02:34:10.307
MANAGE THE HOMELESS- I CAN'T

02:34:10.374 --> 02:34:12.743
IMAGINE THAT ALL THE SUN- WE'RE

02:34:12.810 --> 02:34:14.878
GONNA BE GOING THROUGH A HUGE

02:34:14.945 --> 02:34:17.448
DEVIATION OF THIS OBVIOUSLY- AS

02:34:17.514 --> 02:34:19.216
WE LEARN MORE ABOUT THE DISEASE

02:34:19.283 --> 02:34:20.184
THERE THERE WILL BE CHANGES

02:34:20.250 --> 02:34:21.418
THERE THIS THAT'S TOTALLY

02:34:21.485 --> 02:34:24.722
UNDERSTANDABLE- BUT I GUESS THE

02:34:24.788 --> 02:34:28.125
WAY THE BLANKET AUTHORITY WORKS

02:34:28.192 --> 02:34:30.761
IS THAT. AND YOU KNOW ANY

02:34:30.828 --> 02:34:32.930
ANYTHING CAN BE DONE WHENEVER

02:34:32.997 --> 02:34:34.665
ANYBODY FEELS LIKE IT AND THEY

02:34:34.732 --> 02:34:36.767
DON'T REALLY HAVE TO EVEN GET

02:34:36.834 --> 02:34:38.769
LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL THEY JUST

02:34:38.836 --> 02:34:39.970
NEED YOUR VACATION AND AGAIN

02:34:40.037 --> 02:34:42.072

JUST HIT SEND ON THE EMAIL

02:34:42.673 --> 02:34:46.477
BUTTON. SO AGAIN JUST GOING

02:34:46.543 --> 02:34:47.845
BACK TO MY FIRST POINT IN THE

02:34:47.911 --> 02:34:49.279
QUESTION THAT YOU DIDN'T ANSWER

02:34:49.346 --> 02:34:52.316
WHICH WAS- ON. IT IN ORDER FOR

02:34:52.383 --> 02:34:54.885
THIS. TO CONTINUE TO WORK

02:34:54.952 --> 02:34:55.886
THERE'S GONNA HAVE TO BE

02:34:55.953 --> 02:34:58.088
SIGNIFICANT PROCESS CHANGES OF

02:34:58.155 --> 02:34:59.623
WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN BROUGHT

02:34:59.690 --> 02:35:01.191
FORWARD EITHER IN THE REVISION.

02:35:01.258 --> 02:35:03.794
OR IDEAS BUT THAT'S GONNA HAVE

02:35:03.861 --> 02:35:05.629
TO BE. ABSOLUTELY BROUGHT

02:35:05.696 --> 02:35:07.431
FORWARD THE OTHER CONCERNING

02:35:07.498 --> 02:35:09.733
THING IS THE LITTERING OF

02:35:09.800 --> 02:35:12.036
CONTROL SECTIONS THROUGHOUT THE

02:35:12.102 --> 02:35:14.338
BUDGET. MANY OF WHICH HAVE

02:35:14.405 --> 02:35:16.073
NOTHING TO DO WITH. THE

02:35:16.140 --> 02:35:18.075
PANDEMIC I JUST HAVE ONE

02:35:18.142 --> 02:35:19.610
EXAMPLE AROUND THE GREENHOUSE

02:35:19.677 --> 02:35:22.479
GAS. REDUCTION FUND SO WHY WHY

02:35:22.546 --> 02:35:23.614
ARE THERE SO MANY SECTIONS OF

02:35:23.681 --> 02:35:25.215
THE BUDGET THAT HAVE NOTHING TO

02:35:25.282 --> 02:35:27.117
DO WITH COVERED NINETEEN. WELL

02:35:27.184 --> 02:35:28.252
WHY IS THERE ARE BEEN THIS

02:35:28.318 --> 02:35:29.920
DESIRE TO PUT IN ALL THESE

02:35:29.987 --> 02:35:32.322
CONTROL CONTROL. SECTIONS TO

02:35:32.389 --> 02:35:34.692
HAMPER FUTURE ADMINISTRATIONS

02:35:34.758 --> 02:35:36.960
HAMPER FUTURE LEGISLATORS FROM

02:35:37.027 --> 02:35:40.631
MAKING. BUDGET DECISIONS AND IF

02:35:40.698 --> 02:35:41.699
YOU COULD IF YOU COULD SPEAK

02:35:41.765 --> 02:35:43.233
SPECIFICALLY TO THAT ONE FOR

02:35:43.300 --> 02:35:43.801
THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION

02:35:43.867 --> 02:35:45.969
FUND. IT WOULD BE HELPFUL BUT

02:35:46.036 --> 02:35:48.272
JUST ALSO TALK ABOUT THE- THE

02:35:48.338 --> 02:35:51.108
DESIRE TO HAVE- CONTROL

02:35:51.175 --> 02:35:53.610
SECTIONS ALL OVER THE BUDGET.

02:35:53.677 --> 02:35:54.778
YES SO I'LL SPEAK TO THE

02:35:54.845 --> 02:35:56.680
BROADER QUESTION AND I'LL TURN

02:35:56.747 --> 02:35:57.648
IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE TO

02:35:57.715 --> 02:35:59.016
SPEAK ABOUT THE GREENHOUSE GAS

02:35:59.083 --> 02:36:00.617
REDUCTION FINE I THINK THE

02:36:00.684 --> 02:36:02.252
REASON FOR THESE ADDITIONAL

02:36:02.319 --> 02:36:04.955
CONTROL SECTIONS. NUMBER ONE

02:36:05.022 --> 02:36:06.023
SOME OF THEM RELATE TO THE

02:36:06.090 --> 02:36:06.924
FEDERAL FUNDING AND SPENDING

02:36:06.990 --> 02:36:07.725
BUT I THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE

02:36:07.791 --> 02:36:09.193
TALKING ABOUT A DIFFERENT

02:36:09.259 --> 02:36:11.395
CATEGORIES NUMBER TWO A LOT OF

02:36:11.462 --> 02:36:13.263
THESE PROGRAMS- ARE VERY

02:36:13.330 --> 02:36:14.898
IMPORTANT AND WE KNOW WE ARE

02:36:14.965 --> 02:36:15.733
PROPOSING THAT WE WANT TO

02:36:15.799 --> 02:36:17.000
CONTINUE TO. MAKE THESE

02:36:17.067 --> 02:36:19.136
INVESTMENTS- BUT THE TRUTH IS

02:36:19.203 --> 02:36:20.571
AND THIS IS A TRUE ACROSS THE

02:36:20.637 --> 02:36:22.172
BUDGET THAT BE REVENUE TO

02:36:22.239 --> 02:36:23.974
SUSTAIN THOSE INVESTMENTS IS

02:36:24.041 --> 02:36:25.576
HIGHLY UNCERTAIN REVENUE

02:36:25.642 --> 02:36:26.977
ESTIMATES ARE UNCERTAIN EVERY

02:36:27.044 --> 02:36:28.312
YEAR BUT THIS YEAR MUCH MORE

02:36:28.378 --> 02:36:30.514
UNCERTAIN THAN MOST AND WHILE

02:36:30.581 --> 02:36:32.416
YOU KNOW. WE MAKE OUR

02:36:32.483 --> 02:36:33.717
PROJECTIONS IT'S HARD TO MAKE

02:36:33.784 --> 02:36:34.952
PREDICTIONS BUT THERE IS A

02:36:35.018 --> 02:36:36.954
STRONG POSSIBILITY THAT THAT

02:36:37.020 --> 02:36:39.022
CAP AND TRADE REVENUE- THAT

02:36:39.089 --> 02:36:39.523
FINDS THE GREENHOUSE GAS

02:36:39.590 --> 02:36:40.991
REDUCTIONS FIND WILL BE

02:36:41.058 --> 02:36:42.693
SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER- THIS

02:36:42.760 --> 02:36:44.595
COMING YEAR ND WE PROJECTED

02:36:44.661 --> 02:36:46.096
BACK IN JANUARY AND SO THE

02:36:46.163 --> 02:36:47.965
CONTROL SECTION LANGUAGE. IS A

02:36:48.031 --> 02:36:49.833
PROPOSAL FROM THE

02:36:49.900 --> 02:36:52.336
ADMINISTRATION IN TERMS OUT HOW

02:36:52.402 --> 02:36:54.571
TO GOVERN THE USE OF FUNDS IN A

02:36:54.638 --> 02:36:56.273
SITUATION WHERE THE REVENUE

02:36:56.340 --> 02:36:58.375
COMES IN DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE

02:36:58.442 --> 02:37:00.144
MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED BEFORE I

02:37:00.210 --> 02:37:02.045
THINK THE ONE THING I'LL SAY.

02:37:02.112 --> 02:37:04.314
IS THAT WHEN IT COMES TO FUTURE

02:37:04.381 --> 02:37:05.282
LEGISLATORS FUTURE

02:37:05.349 --> 02:37:07.351

SECTION IS OUR PROPOSAL ON IT

02:37:09.319 --> 02:37:11.188
IS IN STATUTES AND IF

02:37:11.255 --> 02:37:13.290
CONDITIONS CHANGE WE DO OUR

02:37:13.357 --> 02:37:14.658
BEST TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT WITHIN

02:37:14.725 --> 02:37:16.527
THE CONTROL SECTION IS ITSELF

02:37:16.593 --> 02:37:17.961
BUT OF COURSE HAPPY TO. TAKE

02:37:18.028 --> 02:37:19.062

02:37:19.129 --> 02:37:20.664
THOSE BUT THOSE CONTROLS

02:37:20.731 --> 02:37:23.267
ACTIONS CAN ALSO BE MODIFIED BY

02:37:23.333 --> 02:37:25.068
A TEACHER OR EVEN THE CURRENT

02:37:25.135 --> 02:37:26.703
LEGISLATURE BUT ON THE SPECIFIC

02:37:26.770 --> 02:37:30.641
QUESTION THAT YOU RAISED. LET

02:37:30.707 --> 02:37:35.512

PERTAIN TO THE EXPENDITURE AND

02:37:47.057 --> 02:37:49.126
COMMITMENT OF- CAP AND TRADE

SINGLE YEAR WE KNOW. YOU KNOW

02:38:28.599 --> 02:38:30.634
WE KNOW THAT SOMETIMES WE'RE

02:38:30.701 --> 02:38:32.669
WE'RE GONNA OVER ALLOCATE

02:38:32.736 --> 02:38:33.237
WITHIN IS WE'RE GONNA UNDER

02:38:33.303 --> 02:38:36.306
ALLOCATE. THAT I DON'T THINK

02:38:36.373 --> 02:38:38.642
THAT'S- CHANGED. FROM BEFORE

02:38:38.709 --> 02:38:39.576
WAS BUDGETARY NOT GONNA CHANGE

02:38:52.923 --> 02:38:55.359
UNDERSTAND IS WHY YOU SEE THE

02:38:55.425 --> 02:38:58.595
NEED TO- BASICALLY CUT OUT THE

02:38:58.662 --> 02:39:01.365
PUBLIC CUT OUT THE LEGISLATURE

02:39:01.431 --> 02:39:02.566

AND I'VE ALSO SEE HERE'S HERE'S

02:39:04.067 --> 02:39:05.736
THE BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR

02:39:05.802 --> 02:39:06.303

DESIGNED. RIGHT I MEAN YOU'RE

02:39:23.086 --> 02:39:24.588
YOU'RE DOING YOUR JOB AND WE'RE

02:39:24.655 --> 02:39:29.593
DOING OUR JOB. BUT FOR FREE YOU

02:39:29.660 --> 02:39:32.763
TAT NOT GET. PUBLIC FEEDBACK

02:39:32.829 --> 02:39:36.466
NOT GET LEGISLATIVE. FEEDBACK

02:39:36.533 --> 02:39:38.101
FOR THOSE ADJUSTMENTS AND FOR

02:39:38.168 --> 02:39:40.570
THOSE TO BE HAPPENING. OUT OF

02:39:40.637 --> 02:39:42.572
SIGHT I THINK IS. VERY

02:39:42.639 --> 02:39:45.075
TROUBLING AND VERY CONCERNING I

02:39:45.142 --> 02:39:47.744
THINK- I DON'T KNOW HOW HOW IN

02:39:47.811 --> 02:39:49.713
DEPTH THE GOVERNOR WAS BRIEF

02:39:49.780 --> 02:39:51.615
BUT- I DON'T KNOW THAT HE WOULD

02:39:51.682 --> 02:39:53.383
AGREE WITH IT JUST BECAUSE-

02:39:53.450 --> 02:39:55.485
LIKE I SAID BEFORE ON APRIL

02:39:55.552 --> 02:39:57.387
TWENTIETH I THINK. YOU KNOW

02:39:57.454 --> 02:39:59.656
YOUR OUR GOVERNOR IS WHAT

02:39:59.723 --> 02:40:00.958
PROBABLY THE BIGGEST CHAMPION

02:40:01.024 --> 02:40:04.394
OF TRANSPARENCY. THAT I KNOW I

02:40:04.461 --> 02:40:05.896
MEAN HIS WHOLE CAREER HAS BEEN.

02:40:05.963 --> 02:40:07.698
FOCUSED ON PROVIDING MORE

02:40:07.764 --> 02:40:10.300
OPENNESS MORE TRANSPARENCY MORE

02:40:10.367 --> 02:40:13.971
DATA MORE INFORMATION SO THE

02:40:14.037 --> 02:40:18.408
FACT THAT. YOUR YOUR TRYING TO

02:40:18.475 --> 02:40:21.111
ANTICIPATE SCENARIOS AND

02:40:21.178 --> 02:40:23.313
ANTICIPATE ADJUSTMENTS FOR

02:40:23.380 --> 02:40:25.115
SCENARIOS WHICH MAY HAPPEN. MAY

02:40:25.182 --> 02:40:27.884
NOT HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE IS

02:40:27.951 --> 02:40:30.754
VERY AN ORTHODOX BECAUSE THAT'S

02:40:30.821 --> 02:40:34.758
WHY WE HAVE A BUDGET PROCESS-

02:40:34.825 --> 02:40:36.360
WALL WE EVEN MY WHEN THEY ARE

02:40:36.426 --> 02:40:37.995
BEING RECESSED THE GOVERNOR CAN

02:40:38.061 --> 02:40:39.396
CALL AN EXTRAORDINARY SESSION.

02:40:39.463 --> 02:40:41.865
WE'RE NOT IN RECESS WE CAN COME

02:40:41.932 --> 02:40:43.367
BACK IN JANUARY MAKE ANY

02:40:43.433 --> 02:40:45.068
ADJUSTMENTS TO THE BUDGET THAT

02:40:45.135 --> 02:40:48.438
IS NECESSARY. SO TO ME THESE

02:40:48.505 --> 02:40:51.174
CONTROL SECTIONS ESPECIALLY

02:40:51.241 --> 02:40:53.944
THAT AREN'T SPECIFICALLY IN

02:40:54.011 --> 02:40:57.014
REGARDS TO THE- EMERGENCY SEEM.

02:40:57.080 --> 02:41:00.384
VERY MUCH OUT OF PLACE AND A

02:41:00.450 --> 02:41:02.953
HUGE OVERREACH OF AUTHORITY I

02:41:03.020 --> 02:41:04.688
THINK I THINK THE L. L. AND I

02:41:04.755 --> 02:41:07.457
FORGOT TO READ THE LA DOES-

02:41:07.524 --> 02:41:13.030
QUOTE EARLIER. IS THAT THE I

02:41:13.096 --> 02:41:13.764
WILL SUGGEST THAT THE

02:41:13.830 --> 02:41:15.132
LEGISLATURE SHOULD GUARD ITS

02:41:15.198 --> 02:41:16.900
CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE IN THE

02:41:16.967 --> 02:41:21.471
FORTIES IS NOT SO MUCH A- AGAIN.

02:41:21.538 --> 02:41:24.408
IT'S NOT SO MUCH ABOUT THE

02:41:24.474 --> 02:41:26.443
EXPENDITURE I THINK IT IS THE

02:41:26.510 --> 02:41:28.645
PROCESS THAT HAS BEEN SET UP SO

02:41:28.712 --> 02:41:29.980
THAT THE PUBLIC CAN HAVE

02:41:30.047 --> 02:41:32.616
OPPORTUNITY FOR FEEDBACK THE

02:41:32.682 --> 02:41:34.084
LEGISLATURE CAN OPPORTUNITY FOR

02:41:34.151 --> 02:41:36.686
FEEDBACK WE DON'T HAVE A BUDGET

02:41:36.753 --> 02:41:39.089
WITH- FIFTY THOUSAND CONTROL

02:41:39.156 --> 02:41:41.525
SECTIONS BECAUSE MAYBE HIGHER

02:41:41.591 --> 02:41:43.393
READ FUNDING CAME IN LAST OR

02:41:43.460 --> 02:41:44.828
YOU KNOW CHILD CARE FUNDING

02:41:44.895 --> 02:41:47.764
CAME IN MORE FOR HEALTH CARE-

02:41:47.831 --> 02:41:49.066
ALL THIS AND YOU KNOW WE HAD

02:41:49.132 --> 02:41:52.736
MORE MEDI CAL OR CAL WORKS-

02:41:52.803 --> 02:41:53.370
ENROLLMENT THAN WE ANTICIPATED.

02:41:53.437 --> 02:41:56.640
THAT IS THE BUDGET THAT'S

02:41:56.706 --> 02:41:58.875
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. YOU

02:41:58.942 --> 02:41:59.910
KNOW IF WE WERE GOING TO BE

02:41:59.976 --> 02:42:01.978
RIGHT ON THE MONEY WE STILL BE

02:42:02.045 --> 02:42:06.316
IN VEGAS NOT HERE. SO AGAIN.

02:42:06.383 --> 02:42:08.819
THIS IS VERY CONCERNING

02:42:08.885 --> 02:42:11.621
ESPECIALLY. GIVEN THAT YOUR

02:42:11.688 --> 02:42:16.126
AGENCY. HAS SHOWN A DISDAIN TO

02:42:16.193 --> 02:42:17.627
PROPERLY COMMUNICATE WITH THE

02:42:17.694 --> 02:42:20.330
LEGISLATURE. WHEN I SAY THE

02:42:20.397 --> 02:42:20.897
LEGISLATURE I MEAN LEGISLATE

02:42:20.964 --> 02:42:24.668
COURSE. SO AGAIN LET YOU YOU

02:42:24.734 --> 02:42:26.536
CAN TALK TO ALL THE STAFF YOU

02:42:26.603 --> 02:42:30.407
WALKED. BUT IF YOU'RE NOT

02:42:30.474 --> 02:42:32.709
COMMUNICATING WITH ME OR MY

02:42:32.776 --> 02:42:36.847
COLLEAGUES. THAT'S SUCH A WORD

02:42:36.913 --> 02:42:42.119
THE LEGISLATURE. SO AGAIN THE

02:42:42.185 --> 02:42:44.621
THERE WILL NEED TO BE I THINK-

02:42:44.688 --> 02:42:46.123
VERY SERIOUS DISCUSSION OVER

02:42:46.189 --> 02:42:48.892
THE NEXT FEW WEEKS- IN ORDER TO

02:42:48.959 --> 02:42:50.694
REALLY ADDRESS THESE ISSUES I

02:42:50.760 --> 02:42:53.563
KNOW THAT- IN EVERY LEGISLATOR

02:42:53.630 --> 02:42:55.532
THAT I'VE TALKED TO THERE IS A-

02:42:55.599 --> 02:42:57.400
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CONCERN.

02:42:57.467 --> 02:42:59.569
REGARDING THE FUTURE OF THIS

02:42:59.636 --> 02:43:03.006
PROCESS. HAVINGSAID THAT I

02:43:03.073 --> 02:43:04.007
THINK THERE'S ALSO HE- HUGE

02:43:04.074 --> 02:43:06.810
AMOUNT OF SUPPORT WE WANT THE

02:43:06.877 --> 02:43:08.979
GOVERNOR TO BE SUCCESSFUL WE

02:43:09.045 --> 02:43:09.412
WANT THE STATE TO BE

02:43:09.479 --> 02:43:12.115
SUCCESSFUL. WE'RE VERY PROUD OF

02:43:12.182 --> 02:43:15.519
THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE BUT

02:43:15.585 --> 02:43:18.221
WE JUST DON'T THINK THAT. WE

02:43:18.288 --> 02:43:21.091
SHOULD- IGNORE THE LEGISLATURE

02:43:21.158 --> 02:43:23.059
OR IGNORE THE PUBLIC.

02:43:23.126 --> 02:43:26.496
THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS SINCE

02:43:26.563 --> 02:43:27.831
THE JUST TO SORT OF SUMMARIZE I

02:43:27.898 --> 02:43:29.366
THINK WHAT WHAT WE NEED TO SEE

02:43:29.432 --> 02:43:33.503
IS A- SIGNIFICANT. DEFINITION

02:43:33.570 --> 02:43:37.174
OF SCOPE BECAUSE AGAIN IT MOST

02:43:37.240 --> 02:43:37.774
EMERGENCY IF YOU HAVE A

02:43:37.841 --> 02:43:40.544
GEOGRAPHIC DEFINITION AND YOU

02:43:40.610 --> 02:43:45.015
HAVE A PROBLEM DEFINITIONS. SO

02:43:45.081 --> 02:43:48.084
TO SAY IT ALL I GUESS WITH THE

02:43:48.151 --> 02:43:49.319
WILD FAR YOU COULD YOU COULD

02:43:49.386 --> 02:43:50.754
SAY ALL THESE THINGS COULD

02:43:50.820 --> 02:43:52.689
HAPPEN OR COULD NOT HAPPEN. BUT

02:43:52.756 --> 02:43:54.457
IN GENERAL THERE'S A VERY

02:43:54.524 --> 02:43:57.127
SPECIFIC SCOPE IT THAT'S SEEN

02:43:57.194 --> 02:43:59.062
AS REASONABLE WITH THE WITH

02:43:59.129 --> 02:44:01.264
THIS PANDEMIC WHAT YOU'VE DONE

02:44:01.331 --> 02:44:02.666
IS STRETCH THE SCOPE. TO DO

02:44:02.732 --> 02:44:06.803
ANYTHING. SO I THINK THAT YOUR

02:44:06.870 --> 02:44:07.938
DEPARTMENT REALLY NEEDS TO

02:44:08.004 --> 02:44:09.673
HUDDLE WITH ALL THE OTHER

02:44:09.739 --> 02:44:11.675
DEPARTMENTS TO REALLY HAVE MUCH

02:44:11.741 --> 02:44:13.910
BETTER SCOPE DEFINITION AS TO

02:44:13.977 --> 02:44:16.146
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS AND HOW YOU

02:44:16.213 --> 02:44:18.915
INTEND TO SOLVE IT I THINK

02:44:18.982 --> 02:44:21.218
AGAIN. ADJUSTMENTS CAN BE MADE

02:44:21.284 --> 02:44:23.386
IN MID STREAM I DON'T THINK-

02:44:23.453 --> 02:44:24.854
WILL WILL BE PASSED ON MARCH

02:44:24.921 --> 02:44:26.756
SIXTEENTH- BUDGET BILL THAT WAS

02:44:26.823 --> 02:44:29.526
DONE. I THINK IN A FEW YOU KNOW

02:44:29.593 --> 02:44:30.927
IN IN IN A DAY OR TWO BECAUSE

02:44:30.994 --> 02:44:32.128
OF THE EXTRAORDINARY

02:44:32.195 --> 02:44:34.030
CIRCUMSTANCES I THINK WE- WE

02:44:34.097 --> 02:44:35.932
DEMONSTRATED OUR ABILITY. TO

02:44:35.999 --> 02:44:41.238
ACT VERY VERY QUICKLY- I WANTED

02:44:41.304 --> 02:44:44.708
TO GO BACK FOR A SECOND. TO

02:44:44.774 --> 02:44:45.375
INSTITUTIONALLY ONE

02:44:45.442 --> 02:44:47.277
INSTITUTIONS THE DOCTOR WEBER

02:44:47.344 --> 02:44:48.078
MENTION BUT ALSO THE OTHER

02:44:48.144 --> 02:44:51.047
INSTITUTION OF- NURSING HOMES.

02:44:51.114 --> 02:44:53.683
SO TO ME. I'M VERY CONCERNED

02:44:53.750 --> 02:44:56.920
ABOUT BOTH THE ACTION OR THE-

02:44:56.987 --> 02:44:58.588
NOT NOT ENOUGH ACTION TAKING

02:44:58.655 --> 02:45:00.557
PLACE IN BOTH THE NURSING HOME

02:45:00.624 --> 02:45:04.194
SETTING BUT ALSO IN THE-

02:45:04.261 --> 02:45:04.728
CORRECTIONS FACILITIES THE

02:45:04.794 --> 02:45:06.796
PRISON SETTING. BECAUSE IN BOTH

02:45:06.863 --> 02:45:08.732
OF THOSE SITUATIONS YOU HAVE

02:45:08.798 --> 02:45:10.967
POPULATIONS THAT ARE NOT AMPLE

02:45:11.034 --> 02:45:12.636
TORY MEANING THEY'RE NOT GOING

02:45:12.702 --> 02:45:15.005
OUT THE PUBLIC THEY ARE NOT

02:45:15.071 --> 02:45:15.972
GOING TO SHOP AT THE GROCERY

02:45:16.039 --> 02:45:17.807
STORE THEY'RE NOT LEAVING THE

02:45:17.874 --> 02:45:20.210
FACILITY. THE PEOPLE BRINGING

02:45:20.277 --> 02:45:23.446
IN THE DISEASE ARE ALL THE

02:45:23.513 --> 02:45:25.582
EMPLOYEES. AND I'M NOT BLAMING

02:45:25.649 --> 02:45:27.050
THE EMPLOYEES I'M JUST THAT'S

02:45:27.117 --> 02:45:30.020
JUST THAT'S JUST A FACT- YET

02:45:30.086 --> 02:45:32.756
THERE HASN'T BEEN IN MY

02:45:32.822 --> 02:45:36.259
OPINION- ENOUGH ACTION TAKEN

02:45:36.326 --> 02:45:38.595
ESPECIALLY ON THE- CDC OUR SITE

02:45:38.662 --> 02:45:40.730
I WAS I WAS PLEASED IN IN A

02:45:40.797 --> 02:45:41.564
BRIEFING JUST THINK WAS

02:45:41.631 --> 02:45:44.334
YESTERDAY. THAT THERE WAS MORE.

02:45:44.401 --> 02:45:46.803
ACTION TAKEN ON THE NURSING

02:45:46.870 --> 02:45:51.574
HOME SIDE BUT- BUT. IT WAS

02:45:51.641 --> 02:45:53.977
STILL KIND OF BEING PLANNED IT

02:45:54.044 --> 02:45:58.982
WAS NOT- IT WAS NOT A FIRM. AB

02:45:59.049 --> 02:46:02.085
EXECUTION YET SO BOTH IN TERMS

02:46:02.152 --> 02:46:04.421
OF CORRECTIONS AS WELL AS A

02:46:04.487 --> 02:46:07.624
WITH NURSING HOMES HOW FAST IS

02:46:07.691 --> 02:46:09.959
THE ADMINISTRATION PLANNING TO

02:46:10.026 --> 02:46:12.395
ACT. TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S

02:46:12.462 --> 02:46:15.332
PROPER TESTING AND EVALUATION

02:46:15.398 --> 02:46:17.400
OF EMPLOYEES AS THEY GO IN AND

02:46:17.467 --> 02:46:19.202
OUT AND LET LET SOMEONE NURSING

02:46:19.269 --> 02:46:21.004
HOMES BECAUSE MYSELF A COUPLE

02:46:21.071 --> 02:46:22.806
THAT LEGISLATORS GOT BRIEF BUT

02:46:22.872 --> 02:46:25.041
THIS THIS SPECIALLY WITH. WITH

02:46:25.108 --> 02:46:27.877
OUR PRISON SYSTEM. ALL OF THE

02:46:27.944 --> 02:46:30.013
PRESENT SYSTEM I KNOW THAT-

02:46:30.080 --> 02:46:30.980
WHEN IT COMES TO BOTH THE LAY

02:46:31.047 --> 02:46:32.582
OUT OF THESE FACILITIES IN USE

02:46:32.649 --> 02:46:34.818
OF COMMON SPACES- TO IMPROVE

02:46:34.884 --> 02:46:37.153
SOCIAL DISTANCING- AS WELL.

02:46:37.220 --> 02:46:39.089
THANKS THOSE ARE TOP OF MIND I

02:46:39.155 --> 02:46:41.257
DO NOT HAVE A THERE ARE

02:46:41.324 --> 02:46:42.592
COLLEAGUES IDEA LAUGHS WE

02:46:42.659 --> 02:46:44.060
SPECIALIZE IN THOSE ISSUES WITH

02:46:44.127 --> 02:46:45.628
ME- SO I WILL HAVE TO GET BACK

02:46:45.695 --> 02:46:46.429
TO YOU ON THAT MISTER CHAIR.

02:46:46.496 --> 02:46:47.697
THAT THAT'S FINE I THINK I

02:46:47.764 --> 02:46:49.199
THINK JUST TO JUST TO TAKE THE

02:46:49.265 --> 02:46:52.569
POINT HOME IS- AGAIN WE WANT TO

02:46:52.635 --> 02:46:54.404
FOR THE SAFETY OF THE EMPLOYEES

02:46:54.471 --> 02:46:55.438
AND FOR THE SAFETY OF THE

02:46:55.505 --> 02:46:58.842
INMATES AND ALSO AS WELL AS FOR

02:46:58.908 --> 02:46:59.476
THE NURSING HOME. RESIDENTS WE

02:46:59.542 --> 02:47:00.510
NEED TO ESURE THAT THIS PROPER

02:47:00.577 --> 02:47:03.446
TESTING. OF EMPLOYEES THERE HAS

02:47:03.513 --> 02:47:05.949
TO BE REGULAR TESTING- THERE

02:47:06.015 --> 02:47:07.851
HAS TO BE PROPER SAFETY.

02:47:07.917 --> 02:47:10.687
PROTOCOLS FOR EACH OF THOSE.

02:47:10.754 --> 02:47:12.822
PARTICULAR INSTITUTIONS BECAUSE

02:47:12.889 --> 02:47:16.092
ONCE WE'VE SEEN ONCE- ONCE

02:47:16.159 --> 02:47:17.694
COVERT NINETEEN AND THE BANANAS

02:47:17.761 --> 02:47:19.662
TUITION COULD SPREADS. LIKE

02:47:19.729 --> 02:47:21.364
WILDFIRE FOR LACK OF A BETTER

02:47:21.431 --> 02:47:24.934
ANALOGY. NURSING HOME TELL US

02:47:25.001 --> 02:47:26.436
YOUR NURSING HOME POSITIVE

02:47:26.503 --> 02:47:29.105
TESTS ARE ONLY 3% ARE ONLY 3%

02:47:29.172 --> 02:47:30.774
OF CORPORATE POSITIVE TESTS.

02:47:30.840 --> 02:47:33.777
BUT YET THEY ARE 25% OF DEATHS

02:47:33.843 --> 02:47:36.546
IN CALIFORNIA. SO THE STAKES

02:47:36.613 --> 02:47:38.648
ARE ARE FAIRLY HIGH FOR EACH OF

02:47:38.715 --> 02:47:40.717
THOSE INSTITUTIONS AND AGAIN IN

02:47:40.784 --> 02:47:42.185
NEITHER OF THESE RESIDENTS ARE

02:47:42.252 --> 02:47:43.520
