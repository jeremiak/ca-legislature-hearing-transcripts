00:03:30.944 --> 00:03:32.979
JEFFERSON I THINK IT'S

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:34.781
IMPORTANT THAT WE SAY HER NAME.

00:03:34.847 --> 00:03:37.350
BECAUSE THIS REALLY IS A SERIES

00:03:37.417 --> 00:03:38.985
OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:42.789
WOMEN HOWEVER WE SELF IDENTIFY

00:03:42.855 --> 00:03:46.859
AS WOMEN ARE UNDERVALUED OUR-

00:03:46.926 --> 00:03:50.663
DISCARDED AND ARE MARGINALIZED

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.732
BY A SYSTEM NOT DESIGNED TO

UNCEREMONIOUSLY AND WITHOUT

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:03.209
FAVOR AND I THINK IT'S

00:04:03.276 --> 00:04:04.777
IMPORTANT THAT WE SAY HER NAME.

00:04:04.844 --> 00:04:08.781
IT'S NO SECRET THAT OUR NATION

00:04:08.848 --> 00:04:10.750
IS FACING A MASS INCARCERATION

00:04:10.817 --> 00:04:12.952
EPIDEMIC. IF THE PRISON

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.754
POPULATION OF THE UNITED STATES

00:04:14.821 --> 00:04:16.990
WERE A CITY IT WOULD BE AMONG

00:04:17.056 --> 00:04:18.925
THE COUNTRY'S TENTH LARGEST.

00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:21.094
THE UNITED STATES SPENDS

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.162
APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY BILLION

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.198
DOLLARS WITH A B. EACH YEAR ON

00:04:25.264 --> 00:04:28.801
CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES ALONE A

00:04:28.868 --> 00:04:29.469
NUMBER MADE EVEN MORE ALARMING

00:04:29.535 --> 00:04:31.204
WHEN COMPARED TO THE SIXTY

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.139
EIGHT BILLION DISCRETIONARY

00:04:33.206 --> 00:04:35.274
BUDGET OF THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:37.243
EDUCATION. HERE IN CALIFORNIA

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.345

00:04:39.412 --> 00:04:41.047
BILLION DOLLARS ON STATE

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:42.782
CORRECTIONS EXPENDITURES.

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:45.018
THOUGH MOST NATIONAL DISCOURSE

00:04:45.084 --> 00:04:46.886
AROUND CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:48.888
CENTERS ON THE FEDERAL PRISON

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:51.157
SYSTEM THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE

00:04:51.224 --> 00:04:52.959
INCARCERATED PEOPLE ARE HELD IN

00:04:53.026 --> 00:04:53.559
FACILITIES CONTROLLED BY STATE

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:56.763
AND BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. MOST

00:04:56.829 --> 00:04:59.165
OF US ARE AWARE THAT PEOPLE OF

00:04:59.232 --> 00:05:03.002
COLOR PARTICULARLY BLACK PEOPLE

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:03.503
ARE DRAMATICALLY OVER

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:04.937
REPRESENTED IN THE NATION'S

00:05:05.004 --> 00:05:07.040
PRISONS AND JAILS WHAT MANY MAY

00:05:07.106 --> 00:05:09.175
NOT KNOW HOWEVER IS THAT THOSE

00:05:09.242 --> 00:05:10.943
SAME DISPARITIES ARE

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.879
EXACERBATED FOR WOMEN. WHOSE

00:05:12.945 --> 00:05:15.048
RATE OF INCARCERATION HAS BEEN

00:05:15.114 --> 00:05:16.883
RISING FASTER THAN THAT OF MEN

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:19.118
FOR DECADES. SEVERAL STATES

00:05:19.185 --> 00:05:21.220
HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO DECREASE

00:05:21.287 --> 00:05:23.022
THEIR PRISON POPULATION AND

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:25.024
WHILE THE INTENTION IS GOOD

00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:27.226
THESE STEPS OFTEN FOCUS MORE

00:05:27.293 --> 00:05:29.062
DIRECTLY ON MALE PRISON

00:05:29.128 --> 00:05:31.097
POPULATIONS WHILE THE NUMBER OF

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:33.199
MEN AND STATE FACILITIES HAS

00:05:33.266 --> 00:05:37.036
DECREASED THE NUMBER OF WOMEN

00:05:37.103 --> 00:05:37.570
HAS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE LEE

00:05:37.637 --> 00:05:39.238
INCREASED. I'M HAPPY TO REPORT

00:05:39.305 --> 00:05:41.274
THAT CALIFORNIA IS AMONG ONE OF

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.142
THE FOURTEEN STATES WHERE

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:44.777
CHANGES IN WOMEN'S

00:05:44.844 --> 00:05:45.344
INCARCERATION ARE ACTUALLY

00:05:45.411 --> 00:05:47.313
SLOWING THE GROWTH OF STATE

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.182
PARK PRISON POPULATIONS AND

00:05:49.248 --> 00:05:51.150
SOMETIMES EVEN DRIVING DE CAR

00:05:51.217 --> 00:05:53.086
SERRATION ACCORDING TO THE

00:05:53.152 --> 00:05:56.823
PUBLIC POLICY INITIATIVE. BUT

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:58.758
LET'S REMEMBER THAT THAT DIDN'T

00:05:58.825 --> 00:06:00.927
HAPPEN BY CHANCE THE SHIFT

00:06:00.993 --> 00:06:02.762
TOWARDS THE D. KERR SERRATION

00:06:02.829 --> 00:06:04.831
OF WOMEN HAS BEEN MADE POSSIBLE

00:06:04.897 --> 00:06:07.033
BY VOICES THAT CARE AND BY

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.168
VOICES WHO HAVE BEEN IN THE

00:06:09.235 --> 00:06:12.939
STRUGGLE. VOICE IS MUCH LIKE

00:06:13.005 --> 00:06:13.539
THE ADVOCATES WE ARE GOING TO

00:06:13.606 --> 00:06:14.941
HEAR FROM TODAY. FORMALLY

00:06:15.007 --> 00:06:16.843
INCARCERATED WOMEN AND

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:17.376
PROFESSIONALS WITHIN THE

00:06:17.443 --> 00:06:19.245
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM SUCH AS

00:06:19.312 --> 00:06:21.080
THE JUDGES DISTRICT ATTORNEYS

00:06:21.147 --> 00:06:22.982
IN PUBLIC DEFENDERS. PEOPLE WHO

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:25.251
SEE THE GRAVE HARM IN A SOCIETY

00:06:25.318 --> 00:06:26.919
THAT SPENDS MORE MONEY ON

00:06:26.986 --> 00:06:27.487
INCARCERATING PEOPLE THAN ON

00:06:27.553 --> 00:06:31.023
EDUCATING THEM. PEOPLE WHO NOT

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:32.692
ONLY DREAM OF A MORE JUST

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:34.961
SOCIETY BUT TAKE ACTION TO MAKE

00:06:35.027 --> 00:06:36.829
THAT DREAM A REALITY PEOPLE WHO

00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:38.831
KNOW THAT AS PROGRESSIVE AS

00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:41.000
CALIFORNIA MAY BE IN COMPARISON

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:43.035
TO OTHER STATES. IT IS NOT

00:06:43.102 --> 00:06:44.804
ENOUGH IT IS NOT NEARLY ENOUGH.

00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:47.140
THE NEED TO REVIEW AND REFORM

00:06:47.206 --> 00:06:48.908

BELIEVE AND FOUGHT VERY HARD.

00:14:28.901 --> 00:14:33.072
TO TRY AND BE SENTENCED UNDER

00:14:33.138 --> 00:14:36.942
DIFFERENT DRUG COURT GRANT. AND

STICKING OUT AND MY PUBLIC

00:14:54.893 --> 00:14:57.029
DEFENDERS ADVICE WAS THE ONLY

00:14:57.096 --> 00:14:58.764
WAY TO GET OUT OF DOING A

00:14:58.831 --> 00:14:59.398

HAPPEN TO ANYBODY AND I'M HERE

00:24:18.924 --> 00:24:19.457
TO MAKE THAT CHANGE BECAUSE I

00:24:19.524 --> 00:24:20.992
THOUGHT I THINK ALL THESE

00:24:21.059 --> 00:24:23.128
WOMEN. I'M SO EXCITED TO HAVE

00:24:23.195 --> 00:24:34.906
THIS KIND OF ATTENTION. HI I'M

00:24:34.973 --> 00:24:36.741
MY NAME IS NORMA COMPETE ON AND

00:24:36.808 --> 00:24:38.877

00:24:38.944 --> 00:24:42.848
SERVICES MANAGER AT THE ANTI

RECIDIVISM COALITION THAT'S ALL

00:24:43.548 --> 00:24:51.022
IT'S A LOT. SO AS A- AS A YOUNG

00:24:51.089 --> 00:24:53.058
PERSON I FOUND MYSELF IN AN

00:24:53.124 --> 00:24:56.995
ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP. I IT

00:24:57.062 --> 00:24:58.830
DIDN'T I DIDN'T GET THERE

00:24:58.897 --> 00:24:59.397
OVERNIGHT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN

00:24:59.464 --> 00:25:03.001
IMMEDIATELY IT WAS A PROCESS. I

00:25:03.068 --> 00:25:05.203
WAS WAY TOO COMFORTABLE WITH

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:08.974
HAVING CHAOS IN MY LIFE. BUT IT

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:11.276
SPIRALED VERY QUICKLY INTO

00:25:11.343 --> 00:25:16.948
PHYSICAL VIOLENCE. I VAN BECAME

00:25:17.015 --> 00:25:21.052
PREGNANT WITH MY SON. AND WHEN

00:25:21.119 --> 00:25:22.754
I BECAME PREGNANT WITH MY SON

00:25:22.821 --> 00:25:23.355
HE WAS THE LIGHT AT THE END OF

00:25:23.421 --> 00:25:29.294
A TUNNEL. AND I WAS ABLE TO.

00:25:29.361 --> 00:25:32.898
SEE CLEARLY BUT I WANTED IN MY

00:25:32.964 --> 00:25:33.531
LIFE AND IT IT WAS TO BE OUT OF

00:25:33.598 --> 00:25:38.837
THAT RELATIONSHIP. SO I DIDN'T

00:25:38.904 --> 00:25:39.404
HAVE ANY TOOLS I DIDN'T KNOW

00:25:39.471 --> 00:25:43.141
WHAT TO DO. SO IN MY YOUNG

00:25:43.208 --> 00:25:45.176
MESSED UP MINE I MADE A VERY

00:25:45.243 --> 00:25:45.810
BAD DECISION THE WORST DECISION

00:25:45.877 --> 00:25:50.916
OF MY LIFE. WHEN I WENT TO

00:25:50.982 --> 00:25:53.051
SCARE MY SON'S FATHER AND

00:25:53.118 --> 00:26:01.026
INSTEAD I SHOT HIM. HI. I WAS

00:26:01.092 --> 00:26:02.794
OFFERED A MANSLAUGHTER DEAL.

00:26:02.861 --> 00:26:06.932
AND I DID NOT TAKE IT. BECAUSE

00:26:06.998 --> 00:26:09.034
MY BAIL WAS SO LOW AT FIFTY

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:14.839
THOUSAND DOLLARS I THOUGHT THAT

00:26:14.906 --> 00:26:15.473
THIS WAS LIKE AN EPISODE OF LAW

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:17.008
AND ORDER AND IT BILL WHY THEY

00:26:17.075 --> 00:26:19.210
HAD LUNCH IN THE REALIZE I

00:26:19.277 --> 00:26:22.914
DIDN'T MEAN TO DO THAT. AND

00:26:22.981 --> 00:26:24.783
THAT I NEEDED TO RAISE MY SON.

00:26:24.849 --> 00:26:25.350
AND IT WAS ALL GOING TO WORK

00:26:25.417 --> 00:26:30.956
OUT. I'M I WAS RELEASED ON BAIL.

00:26:31.022 --> 00:26:33.091
AND I HAD MY SON. AND I WHICH A

00:26:33.158 --> 00:26:37.028
TRIAL. I'M AND I WAS FOUND

00:26:37.095 --> 00:26:40.799
GUILTY OF SECOND DEGREE MURDER.

00:26:40.865 --> 00:26:45.036
OF ONE OF THE. STATEMENTS FROM

00:26:45.103 --> 00:26:46.771
THE DA THAT REALLY STUCK WITH

00:26:46.838 --> 00:26:49.007
ME IS WHEN HE GAVE THE JURY

00:26:49.074 --> 00:26:51.076
INSTRUCTION HE SAID DO NOT FIND

00:26:51.142 --> 00:26:53.011
THIS WOMAN GUILTY OF

00:26:53.078 --> 00:26:56.748
MANSLAUGHTER THE LESSER CHARGE

00:26:56.815 --> 00:26:58.984
OF MANSLAUGHTER IS RESERVED FOR

00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:01.152
A MAN IN A BAR FIGHT NOT FOR

00:27:01.219 --> 00:27:08.994

HEARINGS THE FIRST BILL WAS THE

00:46:14.238 --> 00:46:15.372

SORT OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. AND

00:46:33.624 --> 00:46:35.159
PLACING THEM IN PRISON AND

00:46:35.225 --> 00:46:36.827
CAUSE MORE TRAUMA TO THEM. ONTO

00:46:36.894 --> 00:46:37.394
THEIR FAMILIES BECAUSE AGAIN

LIKE MY FAMILY MACINNES DOING

00:46:38.996 --> 00:46:41.231
TIME WITH ME. AND WHAT REALLY I

00:46:41.298 --> 00:46:43.300
DIDN'T REALIZE THAT I HAD FACE

00:46:43.367 --> 00:46:45.202
IMMIGRATION CONSEQUENCES I

00:46:45.269 --> 00:46:47.037
THOUGHT AS A PERMANENT RESIDENT

00:46:47.104 --> 00:46:47.638
THAT I WOULD OFFER PROTECTION

00:46:47.704 --> 00:46:49.540
IT WAS UNTIL THREE YEARS FOR MY

00:46:49.606 --> 00:46:50.807
POOR. PAROLE BOARD HEARING. AND

00:46:50.874 --> 00:46:52.976
THEN WHEN I WAS PICKED UP BY.

00:46:53.043 --> 00:46:55.279
AYE AYE. FIVE DETENTION FOR SIX

00:46:55.345 --> 00:46:56.847
MONTHS THE ONLY REASON WHY I'M

00:46:56.914 --> 00:46:59.049
HERE TODAY BECAUSE- THE- THE

00:46:59.116 --> 00:47:00.884
IMMIGRATION JUDGE BELIEVE THAT

00:47:00.951 --> 00:47:01.385
AS A SURVIVOR THAT THE

00:47:01.451 --> 00:47:02.986
CAMBODIAN GOVERNMENT CANNOT

00:47:03.053 --> 00:47:03.554
PROTECT ME FROM THE DEATH

00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:05.055
THREATS. OF MY ABUSER AND- AND

00:47:05.122 --> 00:47:09.092
HIS FAMILY. BUT TO SAY I THINK

00:47:09.159 --> 00:47:09.726
REFORMS HAVE TO BE DONE NOT IN

00:47:09.793 --> 00:47:13.030
THE CRIMINAL. NOT IMMIGRATION

00:47:13.096 --> 00:47:13.597
REFORM AND ALSO WITHIN THE

00:47:13.664 --> 00:47:15.199
STATE REFORM AS WELL TORRANCE

00:47:15.265 --> 00:47:17.000
FROM JUST BEFORE. BECAUSE THESE

00:47:17.067 --> 00:47:18.902
TWO THERE ARE VERY INTERSECTED.

00:47:18.969 --> 00:47:21.104
IF WE WANT TO HAVE A QUICK IT

00:47:21.171 --> 00:47:22.906
EQUALITY EQUITY FOR ALL. DO

00:47:22.973 --> 00:47:25.075
NOT. DO NOT ALL. ALSO INCLUDE

00:47:25.142 --> 00:47:27.010
IMMIGRANTS AS WELL BECAUSE-

00:47:27.077 --> 00:47:29.112
IMMIGRANTS HAVE SERVE TIME THE

00:47:29.179 --> 00:47:30.914
SERVER TIME WHY SHOULD THEY- BE

00:47:30.981 --> 00:47:32.849
CONTINUE CRIMINALIZE FURTHER

00:47:32.916 --> 00:47:35.152
RIGHT. THERE ARE OF LOSS OF LOS

00:47:35.219 --> 00:47:37.020
FANS TO VERIFICATION SYSTEM OF

00:47:37.087 --> 00:47:38.956
AUSTRIA MEMBERS. THIS IS THE

00:47:39.022 --> 00:47:39.523
ONLY HOME THAT WE'VE NOTICES

00:47:39.590 --> 00:47:42.826
PRO CHILDREN. AND WHEN THEY

00:47:42.893 --> 00:47:43.460
WENT TO THIS IS THAT THEY WERE

00:47:43.527 --> 00:47:45.329
NOT TOLD THAT. THEY WERE THEY

00:47:45.395 --> 00:47:46.897
WERE GOING TO FACE IMMIGRATION

00:47:46.964 --> 00:47:48.932
CONSEQUENCES. RIGHT AND I THINK

00:47:48.999 --> 00:47:51.168
PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE A CHOICE OF

00:47:51.235 --> 00:47:51.768
BEING ABLE TO SAY WHETHER THE

00:47:51.835 --> 00:47:53.237
ALONG. WITH WHERE THEY SHOULD

00:47:53.303 --> 00:47:56.907
LIVE. AND I THINK AS LIVING FOR

00:47:56.974 --> 00:47:59.376
THAT IF CALIFORNIA IS A LEADING

00:47:59.443 --> 00:48:00.844
STATE IMMIGRATION REFORM AND-

00:48:00.911 --> 00:48:02.946
AND- LEAVING A SECOND CHANCES

00:48:03.013 --> 00:48:03.413
THAT DO NOT. DISCLOSE

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:05.048
IMMIGRANTS LIKE MYSELF AND

00:48:05.115 --> 00:48:06.984
OTHERS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW I'M

00:48:07.050 --> 00:48:07.517
STILL CITY LEVEL I CAN BE

00:48:07.584 --> 00:48:09.086
PICKED UP ANYTIME AND- THE

00:48:09.152 --> 00:48:10.821
DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS CAN

00:48:10.887 --> 00:48:13.223
START. THOUGH WE APPLIED THE

00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:16.727
GOVERNOR FOR IT'S PUTTING AB

00:48:16.793 --> 00:48:17.327
THIRTY TWO TWO AND PRIVATE THE

00:48:17.394 --> 00:48:18.895
TO AND THE PRESS THE STUMP BUT

00:48:18.962 --> 00:48:20.998
YET. CALIFORNIA SEES OUR NEED

00:48:21.064 --> 00:48:21.632
TO STOP COLLABORATING WITH ICE

00:48:21.698 --> 00:48:28.939
WITHIN THE SYSTEM. TO NOT HAND

00:48:29.006 --> 00:48:29.506

THEY CAN COME HOME. WE DON'T

01:02:09.025 --> 01:02:09.625
THINK THAT THEY CAN BE RIGHT OF

01:02:09.692 --> 01:02:11.294
FREE. TO BECOME WRITER FREE SO

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:12.895

GROUNDED IS THE PEOPLE THAT WE

LEFT. YES I FEEL. I THINK

01:02:32.949 --> 01:02:33.483
SOMETHING REALLY IMPORTANT WAS

01:02:33.549 --> 01:02:35.118
SAID THAT. KIND OF ENCAPSULATED

01:02:35.184 --> 01:02:37.086
EVERYTHING WE WERE ALL KIND OF

01:02:37.153 --> 01:02:37.653
TRYING TO SAY SOMEONE DOWN

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:38.154
THERE I'M SORRY I DON'T

01:02:38.221 --> 01:02:38.888
REMEMBER WHO MENTIONED GETTING

01:02:38.955 --> 01:02:40.756
A WRITE UP FOR HAVING A SUNBURN

01:02:40.823 --> 01:02:43.092
BECAUSE IT WAS YEAH BECAUSE IT

01:02:43.159 --> 01:02:43.593
WAS DESTRUCTION OF STATE

01:02:43.659 --> 01:02:47.130
PROPERTY. AND I THINK IT'S

01:02:47.196 --> 01:02:50.900
REALLY IMPORTANT TO SOMEHOW

01:02:50.967 --> 01:02:51.534
HIGHLIGHTING EMPHASIZE THE FACT

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:55.238
THAT. YOU CAN BE AWAY FROM YOUR

01:02:55.304 --> 01:02:57.106
FAMILIES AND YOUR LOVED ONES

01:02:57.173 --> 01:02:58.908
AND YOUR CHILDREN FOR

01:02:58.975 --> 01:03:00.810
POTENTIALLY A LONGER PERIOD OF

01:03:00.877 --> 01:03:04.914
TIME BECAUSE YOU GOT A SUNBURN

01:03:04.981 --> 01:03:05.548
BECAUSE YOU'RE STATE PROPERTY

01:03:05.615 --> 01:03:07.049
AND YOU'RE NOT MORE THAN THAT

01:03:07.116 --> 01:03:08.918
AND I THINK THAT THE WAY THAT

01:03:08.985 --> 01:03:11.087
THE SYSTEM FAILS PEOPLE IS THAT

01:03:11.154 --> 01:03:12.989
YOU GET PUT INTO A SYSTEM THAT

01:03:13.055 --> 01:03:14.757
DOES EVERY SINGLE THING IT CAN

01:03:14.824 --> 01:03:16.759
TO REMIND YOU THAT YOU DON'T.

01:03:16.826 --> 01:03:17.393
HAVE A RIGHT TO CONNECT TO YOUR

01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:21.130
OWN HUMANITY. ANY TYPE OF

01:03:21.197 --> 01:03:22.999
REHABILITATIVE WORK THERAPY

01:03:23.065 --> 01:03:24.901
GROUP PROCESSING ALL OF THOSE

01:03:24.967 --> 01:03:26.736
THINGS ARE BROUGHT IN BY PEOPLE

01:03:26.802 --> 01:03:28.871
WHO VOLUNTEER THEIR TIME NOT BY

01:03:28.938 --> 01:03:31.007
THE STATE PRISON SYSTEM ITSELF.

01:03:31.073 --> 01:03:32.842
IF YOU'RE NOT IN AN AREA IN A

01:03:32.909 --> 01:03:34.944
PRISON THAT'S EASILY ACCESSIBLE

01:03:35.011 --> 01:03:35.545
IF YOU'RE NOT IN A PRISON THAT

01:03:35.611 --> 01:03:39.115
HAS. OTHER ORGANIZATIONS

01:03:39.182 --> 01:03:41.217
CONNECTED TO IT YOU'RE TOTALLY

01:03:41.284 --> 01:03:41.717
SCREWED AND YOUR STATE

01:03:41.784 --> 01:03:45.254
PROPERTY. AND YOU'RE IN TROUBLE

01:03:45.321 --> 01:03:45.821
IF YOU DON'T HAVE SUNSCREEN.

01:03:45.888 --> 01:03:47.323
AND I THINK THAT A DISSERVICE

01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:50.960
IT'S DONE IS WOMEN PEOPLE WHO

01:03:51.027 --> 01:03:51.561
ARE INCARCERATED I DON'T THINK

01:03:51.627 --> 01:03:53.262
THAT'S NECESSARILY A WOMEN'S

01:03:53.329 --> 01:03:55.264
ISSUE COME BACK INTO THE WORLD

01:03:55.331 --> 01:03:57.200
HAVING SPENT WHATEVER AMOUNT OF

01:03:57.266 --> 01:03:58.868
TIME THEY HAD. EITHER DOING

01:03:58.935 --> 01:03:59.535
EVERY SINGLE THING THEY CAN TO

01:03:59.602 --> 01:04:01.137
HANG ON TO THEIR SANITY

01:04:01.204 --> 01:04:03.372
MISERABLE FOR THE DURATION OF

01:04:03.439 --> 01:04:05.074
THEIR TIME BECAUSE THEY REFUSE

01:04:05.141 --> 01:04:07.176
TO BUY INTO THE IDEA THAT THEY

01:04:07.243 --> 01:04:10.913

PEOPLE. I'M SOMEONE WHO MADE A

01:04:19.222 --> 01:04:21.157
TERRIBLE DECISION I AM NOT THE

01:04:21.224 --> 01:04:22.758
PROPERTY OF AN ORGANIZATION

01:04:22.825 --> 01:04:24.760
THAT DOESN'T REMEMBER MY NAME

01:04:24.827 --> 01:04:26.762

HALF MY CAREER. SO I AM SOMEONE

WHO COMPLETELY UNDERSTANDS THAT

01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:36.972
A CASE IS NOT ABOUT THE PAPER

01:09:37.039 --> 01:09:39.141

CHARGED WITH FELONIES. TO THE

01:09:59.094 --> 01:10:00.896
ALTERNATIVE SENTENCING COURT'S

01:10:00.963 --> 01:10:03.098
JACKIE LACEY HAS BEEN VERY

01:10:03.165 --> 01:10:04.700
SUPPORTIVE OF ALTERNATIVE

01:10:04.767 --> 01:10:05.234
SENTENCING COURTS AND THE

01:10:05.301 --> 01:10:09.038
TREATMENT COURTS. IN TWO

01:10:09.104 --> 01:10:09.638
THOUSAND SEVEN SHE WAS A PART

01:10:09.705 --> 01:10:10.940
OF THE COMMITTEE THAT STARTED

01:10:11.006 --> 01:10:13.042
OF THE WOMEN'S REENTRY COURT

01:10:13.108 --> 01:10:13.576
AND ACTUALLY THE PUBLIC

01:10:13.642 --> 01:10:14.977
DEFENDER WHO WAS PART OF THAT

01:10:15.044 --> 01:10:17.212
COMMITTEE IS HERE TODAY. IN

01:10:17.279 --> 01:10:20.983
SUPPORT OF US AND THAT IS A

01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:23.452
PROGRAM FOR FEMALE DEFENDANTS

01:10:23.519 --> 01:10:25.588
SO I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE

01:10:25.654 --> 01:10:26.855
PROGRAMS THAT I AM INVOLVED IN

01:10:26.922 --> 01:10:28.891
IF I COULD GIVE YOU A BRIEF

01:10:28.958 --> 01:10:29.525
SUMMARY SO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT

01:10:29.592 --> 01:10:31.327
WE'VE ALREADY. AND MAYBE USE

01:10:31.393 --> 01:10:35.030
THAT AS A STEPPING STONE TO GET

01:10:35.097 --> 01:10:37.633
SOME DIALOGUE GULPING IN MAYBE.

01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:41.270
TWEET AND I THINK. THE MAIN TWO

01:10:41.337 --> 01:10:41.870
THINGS OUT OF THE WAY IS THE

01:10:41.937 --> 01:10:44.907
MAIN TWO BARRIERS ARE MONEY.

01:10:44.974 --> 01:10:47.443
AND TREATMENT AND THERE NEEDS

01:10:47.509 --> 01:10:48.043
TO BE MORE OF BOTH. SO WITH

01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:50.813
THAT SAID. ALTERNATIVE

01:10:50.879 --> 01:10:51.447
SENTENCING COURTS ARE DESIGNED

01:10:51.513 --> 01:10:53.115
FOR FELONIES LIKE I INDICATE

01:10:53.182 --> 01:10:55.484
ITSELF THE COUNTY OF LOS

01:10:55.551 --> 01:10:57.453
ANGELES AT A DOWNTOWN A WE HAVE

01:10:57.519 --> 01:10:58.921
A CITY ATTORNEY SO I DON'T HAVE

01:10:58.988 --> 01:11:01.190
THE MISDEMEANORS BUT I DO HAVE

01:11:01.256 --> 01:11:01.690
THE FELONIES SO USUALLY

01:11:01.757 --> 01:11:03.158
INDIVIDUALS ARE CHARGED WITH. A

01:11:03.225 --> 01:11:05.094
VERY SERIOUS CRIMES ARE CHEAP

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:07.062
THEY'RE FACING PRISON TIME

01:11:07.129 --> 01:11:11.033
THEY'RE FACING JAIL TIME. SO I

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:11.667
AM INVOLVED IN SIX ALTERNATES

01:11:11.734 --> 01:11:13.235
SENSING COURTS ONE OF THEM'S

01:11:13.302 --> 01:11:15.270
CALLED THE SENTENCE DEFENDER

01:11:15.337 --> 01:11:17.139
DRUG COURT IT'S THE MOST

01:11:17.206 --> 01:11:17.740
SERIOUS PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE

01:11:17.806 --> 01:11:19.375
IT'S DESIGNED FOR DRUG ADDICTS

01:11:19.441 --> 01:11:21.043
AND IT DOES INVOLVE AN

01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:23.145
INDIVIDUAL STARTING THEIR

01:11:23.212 --> 01:11:25.147
TREATMENT IN JAIL. IT'S IN THE

01:11:25.214 --> 01:11:26.815
TREATMENT POD AND IT'S

01:11:26.882 --> 01:11:29.051
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REALLY

01:11:29.118 --> 01:11:30.819
FOCUSES THE INDIVIDUAL ON

01:11:30.886 --> 01:11:33.022
TREATMENT. AND THESE

01:11:33.088 --> 01:11:33.589
INDIVIDUALS WOULD BE FACING

01:11:33.656 --> 01:11:35.224
PRESENT OUR STATE OR JAIL TIME

01:11:35.290 --> 01:11:38.827
ANYWAY. AFTER THAT THE RELEASED

01:11:38.894 --> 01:11:40.963
INTO RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT AND

01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:41.563
THEN THEY GO TO OUTPATIENT AND

01:11:41.630 --> 01:11:44.833
THEN THEY GO TO AFTER CARE.

01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:45.467
THEY ARE PLACED ON FIVE YEARS

01:11:45.534 --> 01:11:48.937
OF PROBATION. AFTER THEY'VE

01:11:49.004 --> 01:11:49.538
COMPLETED THEIR PROBATIONARY

01:11:49.605 --> 01:11:51.407
TERM ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH IF

01:11:51.473 --> 01:11:53.075
THEY'VE DONE WELL. THEY LIED TO

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:55.177
THE COURT AND THE COURT

01:11:55.244 --> 01:11:56.812
TYPICALLY GRANTS AND EXPAND

01:11:56.879 --> 01:11:59.281
BENT AND THIS IS A DISMISSAL OR

01:11:59.348 --> 01:11:59.848
THEY'RE ALLOWED TO WITHDRAW

01:11:59.915 --> 01:12:01.250
THEIR PLEA. UNDER PENAL CODE

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:03.218
SECTION TWELVE OF THREE POINT

01:12:03.285 --> 01:12:05.354
FOUR AND IF THE CHARGES WHAT WE

01:12:05.421 --> 01:12:07.022
CALL THE WALL THERE WHICH MEANS

01:12:07.089 --> 01:12:09.425
IT'S BETWEEN A FELONY AND

01:12:09.491 --> 01:12:09.992
MISDEMEANOR THE JUDGE WILL

01:12:10.059 --> 01:12:14.997
REDUCE AT SEVENTEEN BE. BUT

01:12:15.064 --> 01:12:15.597
THESE ARE ALL POST CONVICTION

01:12:15.664 --> 01:12:21.203
SENTENCING. SO THE NEXT PROGRAM

01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:23.172
THAT WE RENDON MY COURT ROOM IS

01:12:23.238 --> 01:12:23.806
ALSO THE CO OCCURRING DISORDERS

01:12:23.872 --> 01:12:24.440
COURT IT IS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO

01:12:24.506 --> 01:12:25.174
ARE MENTALLY ILL AND ALSO HAVE

01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:25.808
A SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROBLEM. AND

01:12:25.874 --> 01:12:27.042
THOSE INDIVIDUALS DON'T START

01:12:27.109 --> 01:12:30.879
OFF THEIR TREATMENT IN JAIL MAY

01:12:30.946 --> 01:12:31.480
START OFF THEIR TREATMENT IN

01:12:31.547 --> 01:12:33.115
ACTON ANTELOPE VALLEY

01:12:33.182 --> 01:12:35.284
REHABILITATION CENTER FOR THREE

01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:37.152
MONTHS A LOT OF THE INDIVIDUALS

01:12:37.219 --> 01:12:38.954
WE DON'T ARE HOMELESS. SO IT

01:12:39.021 --> 01:12:40.723
TAKES THEM OUT OF THEIR

01:12:40.789 --> 01:12:42.958
ENVIRONMENT PUTS THEM AWAY AND

01:12:43.025 --> 01:12:44.760
THEY CAN WALK AWAY IT IS NOT A

01:12:44.827 --> 01:12:45.327
LOCKDOWN FACILITY BUT IT'S

01:12:45.394 --> 01:12:47.262
DIFFICULT TO WALK AWAY SO THEY

01:12:47.329 --> 01:12:49.331
MOST OF THEM ARE MOTIVATED TO

01:12:49.398 --> 01:12:51.233
STAY THERE. THEY COME BACK

01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:52.835
DOWNTOWN AND GO TO OUTPATIENT

01:12:52.901 --> 01:12:55.104
AND SOBER LIVING. THE SAME

01:12:55.170 --> 01:12:56.939
THING THEY COMPLETE THE PROGRAM

01:12:57.005 --> 01:12:58.874
AFTER ONE YEAR APPROXIMATELY

01:12:58.941 --> 01:13:00.976
THEY ARE POST CONVICTION POST

01:13:01.043 --> 01:13:03.011
SENTENCING THEY GET THEIR

01:13:03.078 --> 01:13:04.847
CHARGE REDUCED AND THEIR CASE

01:13:04.913 --> 01:13:07.082
DISMISSED. BY THE NEXT ONE THAT

01:13:07.149 --> 01:13:08.984
WE DO IS WHEN IT WAS RE ENTRY

01:13:09.051 --> 01:13:09.585
COURT MEN'S REENTRY COURT IS

01:13:09.651 --> 01:13:11.220
DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHER TWO

01:13:11.286 --> 01:13:13.322
QUARTS IT WAS DESIGNED TO DEAL

01:13:13.388 --> 01:13:15.090
WITH WOMEN'S ISSUES. SO APT

01:13:15.157 --> 01:13:17.526
THAT FACILITY IT'S PROTOTYPES

01:13:17.593 --> 01:13:20.896
IT'S IN POMONA THEY HAVE MORE

01:13:20.963 --> 01:13:23.065
THAN JUST DRUG COUNSELORS WHICH

01:13:23.132 --> 01:13:25.000
I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT. THEY

01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:26.969
HAVE THERAPISTS FOR THE

01:13:27.035 --> 01:13:28.937
INDIVIDUALS THEY HAVE THEY

01:13:29.004 --> 01:13:31.006
ALLOW CHILDREN UP TO THE AGE OF

01:13:31.073 --> 01:13:33.008
ELEVEN THROUGH WOMEN CAN BRING

01:13:33.075 --> 01:13:33.575
THEIR OWN CHILDREN THEY DO

01:13:33.642 --> 01:13:35.310
TREATMENT WITH THEIR CHILD AND-

01:13:35.377 --> 01:13:37.112
THEY TREAT THEIR CHILDREN ALONG

01:13:37.179 --> 01:13:41.183
WITH THE MOTHERS. THEY HAVE A

01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:42.751
PSYCHOLOGIST WHO CAN COME IN

01:13:42.818 --> 01:13:44.920
AND DISTRIBUTE OCCASION. THEY

01:13:44.987 --> 01:13:46.989
DEAL WITH TRAUMA THAT'S

01:13:47.055 --> 01:13:47.623
BASICALLY WHAT THE PROGRAM IS

01:13:47.689 --> 01:13:49.191
DESIGNED FOR WAS TO ASSIST

01:13:49.258 --> 01:13:50.959
WOMEN WHO HAVE SUFFERED FROM

01:13:51.026 --> 01:13:52.995
TRAUMA WHO HAVE SUFFERED FROM

01:13:53.061 --> 01:13:54.897
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. WHO ARE

01:13:54.963 --> 01:13:56.965
VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING SO

01:13:57.032 --> 01:13:58.834
I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT THAT

01:13:58.901 --> 01:13:59.268
THAT PROGRAM IS ALL

01:13:59.334 --> 01:14:01.203
ENCOMPASSING THEY ALSO ALLOW

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:05.307
WOMEN WHO HAVE MEDICAL PROBLEMS

01:14:05.374 --> 01:14:08.911
TO GO TO THAT TREATMENT PROGRAM.

01:14:08.977 --> 01:14:11.446
SO THE GREATEST PART ABOUT THAT

01:14:11.513 --> 01:14:12.080
PROGRAM WAS IT INITIALLY WHEN

01:14:12.147 --> 01:14:13.182
IT WAS STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND

01:14:13.248 --> 01:14:13.649
SEVEN THE PROGRAM WAS

01:14:13.715 --> 01:14:15.017
APPROXIMATELY FIFTY PEOPLE AND

01:14:15.083 --> 01:14:15.584
IT WAS DESIGNED AS A PILOT

01:14:15.651 --> 01:14:17.452
PROGRAM THAT WAS FUNDED BY A

01:14:17.519 --> 01:14:19.555
GRANT. NGUYEN DRUG MEDI CAL

01:14:19.621 --> 01:14:21.123
CAME INTO PLAY WITH NOW BEEN

01:14:21.190 --> 01:14:23.058
ABLE TO EXPAND THAT PROGRAM AND

01:14:23.125 --> 01:14:25.093
WE HAVE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:27.262
FORTY WOMEN IN THAT PROGRAM

01:14:27.329 --> 01:14:29.198
NOW. SO IT STARTED OFF AT FIFTY

01:14:29.264 --> 01:14:32.835
AND WERE A MUCH HIGHER NUMBER.

01:14:32.901 --> 01:14:33.468
AND I THINK YOU KNOW AGAIN THE

01:14:33.535 --> 01:14:35.304
PROBLEMS ARE THE NUMBERS AND

01:14:35.370 --> 01:14:38.874
THE MONEY IS AN ISSUE SO I'M

01:14:38.941 --> 01:14:39.474
ONE INDIVIDUAL I'M THE DA AND

01:14:39.541 --> 01:14:41.777
THE COURT I GO TO COURT FIVE

01:14:41.844 --> 01:14:43.212
DAYS A WEEK. THERE'S ONE OF ME

01:14:43.278 --> 01:14:45.380
AND THERE'S ABOUT FIVE DEFENSE

01:14:45.447 --> 01:14:47.683
ATTORNEYS THAT I WORK WITH. AND

01:14:47.749 --> 01:14:51.153
SO I THINK ONE ISSUE WOULD BE A

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:51.820
NUMBERS GAME IF YOU WANT TO UP

01:14:51.887 --> 01:14:55.090
THE NUMBERS INDIVIDUALS COMING.

01:14:55.157 --> 01:14:57.159
YOU WOULD HAVE TO INCREASE THE

01:14:57.226 --> 01:14:58.994
COURTS ASSIGNED OR THERE'D HAVE

01:14:59.061 --> 01:14:59.528
TO BE PERHAPS A CHANGE IN

01:14:59.595 --> 01:15:02.898
CULTURE. YOU KNOW OF I WAS

01:15:02.965 --> 01:15:05.234
VIEWED AS AT IT'S VIEWED AS A

01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:07.002
NON TRIAL ASSIGNMENT AND MISS

01:15:07.069 --> 01:15:09.004
LACEY WAS VERY SUPPORTIVE OF ME

01:15:09.071 --> 01:15:11.139
AND I WAS PROMOTED IN MY

01:15:11.206 --> 01:15:13.175
ASSIGNMENT. BUT A LOT OF THE

01:15:13.242 --> 01:15:14.977
DA'S DON'T VIEW THIS IS A VERY.

01:15:15.043 --> 01:15:17.379
GOOD ASSIGNMENT AND SO THE

01:15:17.446 --> 01:15:19.014
CULTURE HAS TO CHANGE I THINK

01:15:19.081 --> 01:15:21.149
THE CULTURE IS CHANGING NOW

01:15:21.216 --> 01:15:23.051
THROUGH THESE. THINGS AND

01:15:23.118 --> 01:15:25.153
TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON

01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:28.957
AND HOW IMPORTANT THESE ARE BUT

01:15:29.024 --> 01:15:29.625
I WAS KINDA LOOKED DOWN ON IN

01:15:29.691 --> 01:15:31.193
THE DA'S OFFICE SO. I'VE HELD

01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:33.228
MY HEAD UP HIGH AND I KNOW THE

01:15:33.295 --> 01:15:35.297
GOOD JOB THAT I DO EVERY DAY

01:15:35.364 --> 01:15:36.999
AND THE PEOPLE'S LIVES THAT I

01:15:37.065 --> 01:15:40.903
CHANGE AND THAT'S IMPORTANT HE-

01:15:40.969 --> 01:15:41.403
VETERANS CORD IS ANOTHER

01:15:41.470 --> 01:15:43.171
PROGRAM I'M GETTING TIMED OUT.

01:15:43.238 --> 01:15:45.073
VETERANS CORD IS ANOTHER

01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:47.175
PROGRAM WE WON IN THAT IS ALSO

01:15:47.242 --> 01:15:47.776
FOR WOMEN THERE'S LESS COMMON

01:15:47.843 --> 01:15:51.146
IN THAT PROGRAM. AND OUT OF THE

01:15:51.213 --> 01:15:53.382

INJUSTICES THAT THEY FEEL THAT

01:16:19.141 --> 01:16:19.675
THEY HAVE SUFFERED AND I HOPE

01:16:19.741 --> 01:16:27.282
THAT HELPS. SO BEFORE BY

01:16:27.349 --> 01:16:31.019
DEGREES SPEAKS I WANTED TO SAY

01:16:31.086 --> 01:16:33.088

VACATE THE CONVICTIONS SO THAT.

01:18:00.976 --> 01:18:05.147
IS PART OF A LARGER NARRATIVE

01:18:05.213 --> 01:18:07.082
THAT YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN HEARING

01:18:07.149 --> 01:18:11.319

01:18:11.386 --> 01:18:14.990
THE CALIFORNIA. LEGISLATURE AND

01:18:15.057 --> 01:18:15.490
SO YOU SHOULD GIVE THIS

01:18:15.557 --> 01:18:17.025
ASSEMBLY PERSON AND YOU KNOW

01:18:17.092 --> 01:18:18.960
ALL OF HER COLLEAGUES IN A

01:18:19.027 --> 01:18:20.896
STATE GOVERNMENT HAVE LED THE

01:18:20.962 --> 01:18:23.331
CHARGE FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE

01:18:23.398 --> 01:18:24.966
REFORM HERE IN CALIFORNIA IS

01:18:25.033 --> 01:18:29.037
KIM SAID EVERYBODY'S NOT WITHIN

01:18:29.104 --> 01:18:29.704
THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ON

THE PROSECUTION SIDE IS NOT ON

01:18:31.373 --> 01:18:33.141
BOARD WITH THIS YOU SHOULD KNOW

01:18:33.208 --> 01:18:38.914
THAT. BUT WHERE THE MONEY GOES

01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:40.916
WHERE MONEY GOES FORCES CHANGE

01:18:40.982 --> 01:18:43.085
AND SO A LOT OF THE MONEY THAT

01:18:43.151 --> 01:18:44.953
HAS BEEN COMING INTO THE

01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:46.922
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM FROM

SOME OF THE WOMEN WHO GAVE

01:19:21.623 --> 01:19:25.093
TESTIMONY TODAY. SO CALIFORNIA

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:27.162

01:20:17.812 --> 01:20:18.213
HAVE BECAUSE OF THESE

01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:21.516
ENHANCEMENTS AND SO THAT'S WHAT

01:20:21.583 --> 01:20:23.218
YOU SEE HAPPENING WITH SOME OF

01:20:23.285 --> 01:20:25.587
THE WOMEN WERE TALK ABOUT I WAS

01:20:25.654 --> 01:20:27.122
DOUBLE CHARGED OR I THIS IN

01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:28.924
HERE I GOT THAT'S ENHANCEMENT

01:20:28.990 --> 01:20:31.026
THAT'S HOW THEY WERE GETTING

01:20:31.092 --> 01:20:31.593
THE AT THE TYPE OF TIME THAT

01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:37.132
THEY WERE GETTING. NOW THERE'S

01:20:37.199 --> 01:20:37.766
BEEN A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE WITH

01:20:37.832 --> 01:20:39.301
IN THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:20:39.367 --> 01:20:41.336
WHERE JUDGES ARE GETTING.

01:20:41.403 --> 01:20:44.906
DISCRETION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT

01:20:44.973 --> 01:20:45.407
THEY HAVE TO IMPOSE THE

01:20:45.473 --> 01:20:47.042
SENTENCING HAMMOND THAT'S A

01:20:47.108 --> 01:20:50.879
MAJOR SEA CHANGE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:20:50.946 --> 01:20:52.981
ALSO THE THROUGH THE REFORM

01:20:53.048 --> 01:20:56.785
EFFORTS AT THE STATE LEVEL NOW

01:20:56.851 --> 01:20:57.419
STATE COURTS CAN GO BACK AND

01:20:57.485 --> 01:20:59.154
TAKE A LOOK AT INDIVIDUALS HAVE

01:20:59.221 --> 01:21:00.989
BEEN CONVICTED OF VIOLENT

01:21:01.056 --> 01:21:03.158
CRIMES. AND DETERMINE WHETHER

01:21:03.225 --> 01:21:04.826
THEY QUALIFY FOR RE SENTENCING.

01:21:04.893 --> 01:21:09.164
SOME OF THAT IS DUE TO. BILL US

01:21:09.231 --> 01:21:11.199
US SENATE BILL FOURTEEN THIRTY

01:21:11.266 --> 01:21:14.803
SEVEN WHICH IS. OUR PENAL CODE

01:21:14.869 --> 01:21:16.805
PILOTS IS WHAT YOU COM I KNOW

01:21:16.871 --> 01:21:19.007
IT'S FELONY MURDER. THAT'S BEEN

01:21:19.074 --> 01:21:19.541
A BIG CHANGE WITHIN THE

01:21:19.608 --> 01:21:22.777
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. PEOPLE

01:21:22.844 --> 01:21:25.213
BEING ABLE TO COME BACK FOR

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:29.150
THAT AND ALSO. HAVE BEEN

01:21:29.217 --> 01:21:30.785
CONVICTED OF A VIOLENT CRIMES

01:21:30.852 --> 01:21:31.386
CAN COME BACK AND ASK FOR RE

01:21:31.453 --> 01:21:32.988
SENTENCING FOR ISSUES LIKE. THE

01:21:33.054 --> 01:21:35.056
FACT THAT THEY WERE BEING

01:21:35.123 --> 01:21:38.960
TRAFFICKED. IN HUMAN

01:21:39.027 --> 01:21:41.229
TRAFFICKING AND OR THEY WERE

01:21:41.296 --> 01:21:44.799
THE VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC

01:21:44.866 --> 01:21:45.400
VIOLENCE AND THE PERSON THAT

01:21:45.467 --> 01:21:48.803
THEY KILLED WAS A PERPETRATOR

01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:50.939
OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ON THEM.

01:21:51.006 --> 01:21:51.606
SO THAT'S BEEN A BIG CHANGE IN

01:21:51.673 --> 01:21:55.210
AND THAT GOES TO RIGHT TO THE

01:21:55.277 --> 01:21:57.479
HEART OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING

01:21:57.545 --> 01:21:58.079
ABOUT TODAY BECAUSE A LOT OF

01:21:58.146 --> 01:22:01.149
WOMEN THAT AS YOU HEARD THAT

01:22:01.216 --> 01:22:01.683
COME THROUGH THE CRIMINAL

01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:03.318
JUSTICE SYSTEM FOR VIOLENT

01:22:03.385 --> 01:22:05.654
CRIMES. UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF

01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:07.756
TIMES A DAY BEEN SEXUALLY

01:22:07.822 --> 01:22:11.092
TRAFFICKED. AND OR THEY WERE

01:22:11.159 --> 01:22:11.626
THE VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC

01:22:11.693 --> 01:22:13.328
VIOLENCE AND THE CRIME THAT THE

01:22:13.395 --> 01:22:17.065
PERPETRATOR WAS AGAINST THE PER

01:22:17.132 --> 01:22:17.632
PERSON WHO PERPETRATED CRIME

01:22:17.699 --> 01:22:19.167
AGAINST THEM. I THINK IN THE

01:22:19.234 --> 01:22:21.469
LONG RUN. WHAT WE SHOULD BE

01:22:21.536 --> 01:22:23.138
TALKING ABOUT IN A AND THE

01:22:23.204 --> 01:22:25.073
LEGISLATURE IS TALKING ABOUT IT

01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:27.008
BUT IT'S A DIFFICULT PROBLEM

01:22:27.075 --> 01:22:29.277
IS. THE BIG ISSUE OUT THERE IS

01:22:29.344 --> 01:22:32.947
BE ALL REFORM. AND IT'S A VERY

01:22:33.014 --> 01:22:33.515
DIFFICULT ISSUE WE HAVE TO

01:22:33.581 --> 01:22:35.317
FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET OUR ARMS

01:22:35.383 --> 01:22:37.152
AROUND IT. BECAUSE THERE'S A

01:22:37.218 --> 01:22:38.953
THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES

01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:41.156
INVOLVED WE WANT THE COMMUNITY

01:22:41.222 --> 01:22:43.158
BE TO BE SAFE. BUT WE WANT

01:22:43.224 --> 01:22:46.695
INDIVIDUALS TO HAVE OPPORTUNITY

01:22:46.761 --> 01:22:47.295
TO GET OUT AND TO FIGHT THEIR

01:22:47.362 --> 01:22:51.032
CASE. ON A FAIR BASIS AND SO WE

01:22:51.099 --> 01:22:53.168
EVERYBODY WITHIN THE CRIMINAL

01:22:53.234 --> 01:22:54.969
JUSTICE SYSTEM HAS TO FIGURE

01:22:55.036 --> 01:22:55.537
OUT HOW TO GET THEIR ARMS

01:22:55.603 --> 01:22:57.305
AROUND IT AND HAVE IN IT TO BE

01:22:57.372 --> 01:23:00.942
DONE IN A FAIR. MANNER WHETHER

01:23:01.009 --> 01:23:03.144
IT'S SOME FORM OF MONEY BUILT

01:23:03.211 --> 01:23:04.913
WHETHER IT'S A NO BAIL. MANY

01:23:04.979 --> 01:23:07.182
PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED THAT IF

01:23:07.248 --> 01:23:09.117
YOU HAVE NO NO MONEY BAIL. THAT

01:23:09.184 --> 01:23:11.319
JUDGES WILL JUST DEFAULT TO

01:23:11.386 --> 01:23:13.188
KEEPING EVERYBODY IN BECAUSE

01:23:13.254 --> 01:23:15.090
THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE THE

01:23:15.156 --> 01:23:17.025
SAFEST THING TO DO. SO THE

01:23:17.092 --> 01:23:18.927
LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO SERIOUSLY

01:23:18.993 --> 01:23:21.129
CONSIDER ALL THE RAMIFICATIONS.

01:23:21.196 --> 01:23:23.164
OF BAIL REFORM AND TRY TO MAKE

01:23:23.231 --> 01:23:25.200
SURE THAT WHEN WE DO THIS WE

01:23:25.266 --> 01:23:27.135
DON'T DO IT PIECEMEAL THAT WE

01:23:27.202 --> 01:23:28.970
DO IT WITH A GREAT STUDY AND

01:23:29.037 --> 01:23:30.972
THAT WE DO IT RIGHT. SO THAT

01:23:31.039 --> 01:23:33.341
PEOPLE ARE FAIRLY TREATED AND

01:23:33.408 --> 01:23:35.243
THAT'S ONE THING I WANT TO SAY

01:23:35.310 --> 01:23:38.813
THE LAST THING I WANT TO SAY IS

01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:39.381
THAT IN TERMS OF THIS WHOLE

01:23:39.447 --> 01:23:41.149
AREA OF THE WOMEN

01:23:41.216 --> 01:23:43.084
INCARCERATION. KIM ALLUDED TO

01:23:43.151 --> 01:23:45.353
THIS BUT WE NEED. IN THAT

01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:47.222
WITHIN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE

01:23:47.288 --> 01:23:48.890
SYSTEM WE NEED THE MONEY. TO

01:23:48.957 --> 01:23:51.326
IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAMS THAT

01:23:51.393 --> 01:23:53.061
WERE MANDATED BY THE REFORMS

01:23:53.128 --> 01:23:58.833
THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SO.

01:23:58.900 --> 01:23:59.467
IF YOU WANT SOMEBODY TO BE ABLE

01:23:59.534 --> 01:24:05.106
TO GET OUT. TO FIGHT THEIR

01:24:05.173 --> 01:24:05.673
CRIME THEY NEED TO HAVE TO

01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:07.275
PLACE TO GO TO IF YOU'RE GOING

01:24:07.342 --> 01:24:07.942
TO DIVERT SOMEBODY BECAUSE THEY

01:24:08.009 --> 01:24:09.043
HAVE A MENTAL ILLNESS OR

01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:09.677
BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO DEAL

01:24:09.744 --> 01:24:10.278
WITH THE DRUG ADDITION. THEY

01:24:10.345 --> 01:24:12.981
NEED TO HAVE A PLACE TO GO TO

01:24:13.047 --> 01:24:13.515
WHERE THEY THEY CAN GET

01:24:13.581 --> 01:24:15.583
TREATMENT. AND THAT THEY'RE NOT

01:24:15.650 --> 01:24:17.252
GOING BACK OUT ON THE STREET

01:24:17.318 --> 01:24:19.287
AND COMMITTING A CRIME BECAUSE

01:24:19.354 --> 01:24:21.256
OF THE MENTAL ILLNESS THAT

01:24:21.322 --> 01:24:23.224
THEY'RE FACING OR BECAUSE THAT

01:24:23.291 --> 01:24:25.160
THE DEMONS THAT THEY'RE FACING

01:24:25.226 --> 01:24:26.928
WITH RESPECT TO ADDICTION. AND

01:24:26.995 --> 01:24:27.495
THAT'S PROBABLY THE BIGGEST

01:24:27.562 --> 01:24:29.297
THING THAT WE TALK ABOUT WITHIN

01:24:29.364 --> 01:24:32.901
THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. IS

01:24:32.967 --> 01:24:37.038
THAT THERE HAS TO BE. MONEY

01:24:37.105 --> 01:24:40.708
ATTACH ANYTIME A BILL. IS

01:24:40.775 --> 01:24:41.276
PASSED WHERE WERE MANDATING

01:24:41.342 --> 01:24:43.111
REFORM THERE NEEDS TO BE MONEY

01:24:43.178 --> 01:24:45.079
ATTACHED TO THAT SO THAT WE CAN

01:24:45.146 --> 01:24:46.981
ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT. THE GOOD

01:24:47.048 --> 01:24:48.716
WORK THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO.

01:24:48.783 --> 01:24:50.952
BUT I WANT TO SAY THAT THIS IS

01:24:51.019 --> 01:24:52.854
TREMENDOUS I THINK THIS IS A

01:24:52.921 --> 01:24:53.488
GREAT THING. THE OTHER THING I

01:24:53.555 --> 01:24:56.825
WILL SAY IS THAT. THE LAST

01:24:56.891 --> 01:24:57.325
THING ON A SAY IS THAT

01:24:57.392 --> 01:25:01.129
STATISTICS. ARE SO IMPORTANT

01:25:01.196 --> 01:25:04.866
WITH HOW WE GO ABOUT DOING WHAT

01:25:04.933 --> 01:25:05.433
WE DO WITH IN THE CRIMINAL

01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:07.235
JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND I SEE ISAAC

01:25:07.302 --> 01:25:09.070
IS IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM.

01:25:09.137 --> 01:25:12.707
HE'S BEEN A BIG PROPONENT OF

01:25:12.774 --> 01:25:13.308
THIS AND I KNOW A LOT OF THE

01:25:13.374 --> 01:25:14.976
CHAINS THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING.

01:25:15.043 --> 01:25:17.178
LOCALLY HERE HAS BEEN DRIVEN

01:25:17.245 --> 01:25:19.147
BY. THE MONEY THAT THE

01:25:19.214 --> 01:25:23.017
LEGISLATURE HAS PUT UP FOR IT.

01:25:23.084 --> 01:25:27.121
A DATA DRIVEN WORK. AND THAT'S

01:25:27.188 --> 01:25:29.157
GOT TO CONTINUE PARTICULARLY IN

01:25:29.224 --> 01:25:31.292
THIS SPACE BECAUSE OF THE MORE

01:25:31.359 --> 01:25:33.127
DATA THAT WE HAVE AS TO WHAT'S

01:25:33.194 --> 01:25:35.096
HAPPENING WITH THE WOMEN. IN

01:25:35.163 --> 01:25:39.033
PRISONS. WHY THEY MAY NOT BE

01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:41.102
GETTING BAIL WHY THEY MAKE I

01:25:41.169 --> 01:25:42.837
HAVE GOTTEN A PARTICULAR

01:25:42.904 --> 01:25:44.839
SENTENCE THAT THEY GOT. THAT'S

01:25:44.906 --> 01:25:46.841
GOING TO GIVE US THE AMMUNITION

01:25:46.908 --> 01:25:48.877
TO BE ABLE TO MAKE. A DATA

01:25:48.943 --> 01:25:51.179
DRIVEN REFORMS THAT ARE SO

01:25:51.246 --> 01:25:52.981
NECESSARY WITH IN THE CRIMINAL

01:25:53.047 --> 01:25:55.283

FIGHTING FOR A BROTHER WITH

01:31:37.191 --> 01:31:38.893

FOR PEOPLE IN SITUATIONS LIKE

01:32:04.952 --> 01:32:07.221
HIM. AND ULTIMATELY STARTED MY

01:32:07.288 --> 01:32:08.890
CAREER TWENTY YEARS AGO AND

01:32:08.956 --> 01:32:09.557
CRIMINALS ARE. ACTUALLY BACK IN

MY ENTIRE LIFE. TWO MINUTES SO

01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:21.269
I WILL SAY THAT I THINK WHAT WE

01:32:23.037 --> 01:32:25.006
WORK WITH COMMUNITIES THE

01:32:25.072 --> 01:32:27.108
COMMUNITIES NO THIS WORK I

01:32:27.174 --> 01:32:27.675
THINK IT'S OUR JOB IN THE

01:32:27.742 --> 01:32:29.043
PUBLIC SECTOR. TO SUPPORT THE

01:32:29.110 --> 01:32:30.878
COMMUNITIES THAT DO THIS WORK

01:32:30.945 --> 01:32:31.479
AND I WILL ALSO SUPPORT MY

01:32:31.545 --> 01:32:34.916
OTHER PANELISTS AND- IN THE

01:32:34.982 --> 01:32:36.918
DISCUSSION AND THE- THE

01:32:36.984 --> 01:32:37.518
KNOWLEDGE MEANT THAT WE NEED

01:32:37.585 --> 01:32:39.553
MORE DATA. SO IT AGAIN HUGE

01:32:39.620 --> 01:32:41.222
HUGE STEP SHOUT OUT TO MILLION

01:32:41.289 --> 01:32:43.057
DOLLAR HOODS AND THE ABILITY TO

01:32:43.124 --> 01:32:43.658
GET THE DATA OUT OF THE SHARE

01:32:43.724 --> 01:32:45.092
OF SYSTEM. AND DO SOMETHING

01:32:45.159 --> 01:32:47.128
MEANINGFUL WITH IT AND ANALYZE

01:32:47.194 --> 01:32:49.030
IT IN A WAY THAT'S USEFUL TO

01:32:49.096 --> 01:32:50.898
ALL OF US. WHO ARE DOING THIS

01:32:50.965 --> 01:32:53.167
WORK I THINK IT'S REALLY REALLY

01:32:53.234 --> 01:32:53.834
IMPORTANT TO HAVE THAT DATA HER

01:32:53.901 --> 01:32:55.303
HANDS IN OUR FINGER TIPS.

01:32:55.369 --> 01:32:59.073
BECAUSE WE NEED TO HAVE WE NEED

01:33:00.975 --> 01:33:01.509
AND CONTINUE TO DO CONTINUES

01:33:01.575 --> 01:33:03.244
CAN IMPROVE AND I THINK. SO A

01:33:03.311 --> 01:33:05.046
TIME. COMMUNITY BASED

01:33:05.112 --> 01:33:06.981
ORGANIZATIONS C. C. PUBLIC

01:33:07.048 --> 01:33:09.350
SECTOR GOVERNMENT FUNDERS AS

01:33:09.417 --> 01:33:11.118
COMING INTO AUDIT AND KIND OF

01:33:11.185 --> 01:33:12.853
SLAP THEM ON THE WRIST AND WE

01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:13.487
REALLY ATTEMPTED TO MAKE A VERY

01:33:13.554 --> 01:33:17.091
DIFFERENT. APPROACH TO THIS AND

01:33:17.158 --> 01:33:17.725
THAT IS ALL THROUGH CONTINUOUS

01:33:17.792 --> 01:33:19.093
IMPROVEMENT. AND THAT WE ARE

01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:20.828
HERE TO SUPPORT YOU CANNOT

01:33:20.895 --> 01:33:23.097

SUPPORT IT THROUGH THROUGH THE

01:33:25.833 --> 01:33:28.803
ON THURSDAY AB. I THINK THE BIG

01:33:28.869 --> 01:33:31.005
THING TOO IS. SOME OF THE

01:33:31.072 --> 01:33:32.873
ANDREAS IS KIND OF BREAKING THE

01:33:32.940 --> 01:33:37.345
SILOS. IN FIGURING OUT HOW TO

01:33:37.411 --> 01:33:41.115
LEVERAGE RESOURCES RIGHT. HELLO

01:33:41.182 --> 01:33:43.117

SQUEEZE OUT AS MUCH OF IT AS WE

01:33:47.054 --> 01:33:47.521
POSSIBLY CAN. AND I THINK

01:33:47.588 --> 01:33:48.155
BREAKING THE SILENCE IS REALLY

01:33:48.222 --> 01:33:48.823
IMPORTANT I THINK DR IS. REALLY

01:33:48.889 --> 01:33:51.192
UNIQUELY POSITIONED IN THAT WAY

01:33:51.258 --> 01:33:51.826
BECAUSE WE ARE REPRESENTING THE

01:33:51.892 --> 01:33:53.394
PEOPLE. PEOPLE POPULATION

01:33:53.461 --> 01:33:57.164
RATHER THAN SERVICES MANY MANY

01:33:57.231 --> 01:33:58.799
DEPARTMENTS ARE USUALLY

01:33:58.866 --> 01:34:00.901
DESIGNED BASED ON FUNDING

01:34:00.968 --> 01:34:01.502
STREAMS BASED ON SERVICES AND

01:34:01.569 --> 01:34:02.937
THAT'S AND THAT'S ALL GREAT.

01:34:03.004 --> 01:34:05.172
BUT WHAT WE FIND YOU KNOW WE

01:34:05.239 --> 01:34:05.773
HAVE A WE ARE IS WE HAVE TO

01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:07.308

UNIQUE NEEDS OF THIS

01:34:09.510 --> 01:34:11.245
POPULATION. AND THAT TRANSCENDS

01:34:11.312 --> 01:34:13.047
ALL OF THE COUNTY AGENCIES SO

01:34:13.114 --> 01:34:15.282

ELIMINATING PEPPER SPRAY. WE

01:39:49.416 --> 01:39:50.884
ARE NOW STUDYING HOW TO REMOVE

01:39:50.951 --> 01:39:54.988
PROBATION FROM THE OVERSIGHT OF

01:39:55.055 --> 01:39:55.522
JUVENILES BECAUSE OF THE

01:39:55.589 --> 01:39:57.257
FAILED. SYSTEM THAT WE'VE HAS

01:39:57.324 --> 01:40:00.894
DEVELOPED AND WE ARE POSSIBLY

01:40:00.961 --> 01:40:03.163
WRITTEN MOVING TOWARDS MORE

01:40:03.230 --> 01:40:04.832
HARM REDUCTION MEDICAL MODEL

NOT ONLY FOR THE KIDS IN THE

01:40:07.267 --> 01:40:09.169
LOCAL SYSTEM BUT ALSO. GOVERNOR

01:40:09.236 --> 01:40:10.938
NEWSOME HAS ANNOUNCED THAT HE'S

01:40:11.004 --> 01:40:14.742
PLANNING TO REMOVE DJJ FROM CDC

01:40:14.808 --> 01:40:16.944
ARE INTO A POTENTIALLY DEVELOP

01:40:17.010 --> 01:40:18.846
TO DEPART HEALTH SERVICES SO

01:40:18.912 --> 01:40:20.948
ALL THAT IS GREAT NEWS. BUT

01:40:21.014 --> 01:40:22.916
THEY'RE STILL BAD NEWS AND

01:40:22.983 --> 01:40:23.484
BECAUSE WE'RE HERE TO TALK

01:40:23.550 --> 01:40:25.319
ABOUT GIRLS AND WOMEN. THE BAD

01:40:25.386 --> 01:40:27.254
NEWS IS THAT THE PROPORTION OF

01:40:27.321 --> 01:40:29.256
GIRLS IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE

01:40:29.323 --> 01:40:33.127
SYSTEM HAS INCREASED. AT EVERY

01:40:33.193 --> 01:40:34.962
STAGE OF THE PROCESS. I DON'T

01:40:35.028 --> 01:40:36.730
MEAN THE NUMBER OF GIRLS IS AS

01:40:36.797 --> 01:40:37.331
I'VE SAID THE CRIME LEVEL HAS

01:40:37.398 --> 01:40:39.299
GONE DOWN BUT THE PROPORTION

01:40:39.366 --> 01:40:41.468
HAS RISEN. AND THAT'S OVER ALL

01:40:41.535 --> 01:40:43.537
STAGES THE PROCEEDINGS ARREST

01:40:43.604 --> 01:40:46.807
DETENTION AND PROBATION. AND

01:40:46.874 --> 01:40:49.109
THE OTHER BAD NEWS IS THAT THE

01:40:49.176 --> 01:40:52.913
GENDER GAP IS TREMENDOUS IN THE

01:40:52.980 --> 01:40:53.547
DETENTION OF GIRLS FOR REALLY

01:40:53.614 --> 01:40:54.982
LOW LEVEL CRIMES YOU LOOK AT.

01:40:55.048 --> 01:40:57.084
WHO'S DETAINED FOR LOW LEVEL

01:40:57.151 --> 01:40:59.019
CRIMES THE PERCENTAGE IS MUCH

01:40:59.086 --> 01:41:02.923
HIGHER FEMALE PERCENTAGE. WE

01:41:02.990 --> 01:41:07.027
ALSO KNOW AND I THINK ANY. ONE

01:41:07.094 --> 01:41:10.864
IN THIS ROOM KNOWS THAT. THE

01:41:10.931 --> 01:41:11.398
REASON GIRLS AND UP IN THE

01:41:11.465 --> 01:41:12.900
JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. 31% OF

01:41:12.966 --> 01:41:15.135
THE STUDY FOR TWO THOUSAND

EXPRESSES SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN

01:41:18.972 --> 01:41:21.074
THE HOME FORTY OVER 40% HAVE

01:41:21.141 --> 01:41:22.743
BEEN FITTED PHYSICALLY ABUSED

01:41:22.810 --> 01:41:25.078
84% HAVE FAMILY ABUSE THEY

01:41:25.145 --> 01:41:27.247
REPORT SEXUAL ABUSE AT THE RATE

01:41:27.314 --> 01:41:29.149
OF OVER FOUR AND A HALF TIMES

01:41:29.216 --> 01:41:29.783
THAT OF BOYS COMING INTO THE

01:41:29.850 --> 01:41:31.185
JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND

01:41:31.251 --> 01:41:35.055
THAT TELLS US A LOT. ABOUT WHY

01:41:35.122 --> 01:41:37.357
GIRLS ARE IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM

01:41:37.424 --> 01:41:41.195
AND ALSO ABOUT. WHAT WE NEED TO

01:41:41.261 --> 01:41:44.865
DO AND HOW WE CAN ADDRESS THIS

01:41:44.932 --> 01:41:46.867
TO ME IT MEANS THAT THE JUSTICE

01:41:46.934 --> 01:41:49.169
SYSTEM IS NOT THE PLACE. TO

01:41:49.236 --> 01:41:53.340
HEAL. ANYBODY BUT ESPECIALLY TO

01:41:53.407 --> 01:41:55.242
HEAL TRAUMATIZED KIDS SO MY

01:41:55.309 --> 01:41:57.377
NUMBER ONE SUGGESTION FOR

01:41:57.444 --> 01:42:00.781
REFORM IS KEEP US OUT OF IT I

01:42:00.848 --> 01:42:03.016
MEAN I LOVE MY JOB. WHAT WHAT

01:42:03.083 --> 01:42:03.617
YOU KNOW I'M GONNA RETIRED A

01:42:03.684 --> 01:42:05.252
COUPLE YEARS AND MIGHT YOU KNOW

01:42:05.319 --> 01:42:06.820
KEEP US OUT OF IT BECAUSE WE

01:42:06.887 --> 01:42:09.122
DON'T DO IT WELL IT'S NOT OUR

01:42:09.189 --> 01:42:11.358
PURPOSE SO I AM REALLY HAPPY

01:42:11.425 --> 01:42:13.293
ABOUT THE- EFFORTS THAT HAVE

01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:15.229
BEEN MADE THE TREMENDOUS

01:42:15.295 --> 01:42:17.331
EFFORTS HAVE BEEN MADE BY THE

01:42:17.397 --> 01:42:18.866
OFFICE OF DIVERSION RE ENTRY.

01:42:18.932 --> 01:42:19.500
AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

01:42:19.566 --> 01:42:22.769
A LOT OF SUCCESS WITH THAT NOT

01:42:22.836 --> 01:42:23.370
JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO

01:42:23.437 --> 01:42:25.305
SORT OF DIVERT IN NAME BUT

01:42:25.372 --> 01:42:26.874
BECAUSE THEY'RE BACKING IT UP

01:42:26.940 --> 01:42:29.176
WITH LISTENING TO THE RIGHT

01:42:29.243 --> 01:42:31.178
PEOPLE ABOUT HOW THEY SHOULD DO

01:42:31.245 --> 01:42:33.046
IT. I THINK ANOTHER SUGGESTION

01:42:33.113 --> 01:42:35.215
THAT I HAVE AND I AND I THINK

01:42:35.282 --> 01:42:36.884
APRIL STORY TOUCHED ME SO MUCH

01:42:36.950 --> 01:42:42.890
BECAUSE- AS HORRIBLE AS IT IS.

01:42:42.956 --> 01:42:45.092
IT IS SO TYPICAL. IT IS JUST

01:42:45.158 --> 01:42:49.162
IT'S A. IT'S SOMETHING I HEAR

01:42:49.229 --> 01:42:51.064
DAY IN AND DAY OUT ABOUT HOW.

01:42:51.131 --> 01:42:53.033
THIS THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM IS

01:42:53.100 --> 01:42:55.068
BROKEN. AND I GO THERE EVERY

01:42:55.135 --> 01:42:57.070
TWO WEEKS AND I REPRESENT KIDS

01:42:57.137 --> 01:42:59.106
WHO ARE DAHLE STATUS KIDS KIDS

01:42:59.172 --> 01:43:01.108
WERE CROSSED OVER. AND I'M JUST.

01:43:01.174 --> 01:43:04.912
I'M JUST BLOWN AWAY THAT PART

01:43:04.978 --> 01:43:05.445
OF IT IS BECAUSE IT'S VERY

01:43:05.512 --> 01:43:07.014
SECRET CONFIDENTIAL AND THE

01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:08.749
PROCEEDINGS ARE CLOSE SOMETIMES

01:43:08.815 --> 01:43:10.918
FOR VERY GOOD REASONS BUT- I'M

01:43:10.984 --> 01:43:12.986
BLOWN AWAY AT AT OUR OUR- OUR

01:43:13.053 --> 01:43:15.055
WILLINGNESS TO ALLOW THIS TO GO

01:43:15.122 --> 01:43:17.124
ON I MEAN THE SYSTEM'S BROKEN.

01:43:17.190 --> 01:43:19.059
THE TOURNEY'S HAVE HUNDREDS OF

01:43:19.126 --> 01:43:22.863
CASES THEY- REALLY CAN'T DO

01:43:22.930 --> 01:43:24.865
ANYTHING THEIR PARALYZED FROM

01:43:24.932 --> 01:43:26.934
BEING ABLE TO DO ANYTHING. THE

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:30.938
THERE'S NO TRAUMA SCREENING IT

01:43:31.004 --> 01:43:32.773
MANDATORY FOR KIDS IT SHOULD BE

01:43:32.839 --> 01:43:33.373
FOR EVERY KID THE SHIP EVERY

01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:34.775
KID SHOULD HAVE EDUCATIONAL

01:43:34.841 --> 01:43:35.375
SCREENING YOU DON'T KNOW HOW

01:43:35.442 --> 01:43:37.344
MANY KIDS COME TO THE JUVENILE

01:43:37.411 --> 01:43:39.079
JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND THEY'VE

01:43:39.146 --> 01:43:39.646
NEVER HAD NINETY P. THEY'VE

01:43:39.713 --> 01:43:41.281
NEVER HAD ANY BE LOOK AT OUR

01:43:41.348 --> 01:43:43.150
SCHOOL SYSTEM AND SEE WHAT WHAT

01:43:43.216 --> 01:43:44.985
ARE THE PROBLEMS THAT THEY NEED

01:43:45.052 --> 01:43:45.552
SO THEIR FALLING THROUGH THE

01:43:45.619 --> 01:43:49.022
CRACKS IN THE FOSTER CARE

01:43:49.089 --> 01:43:49.590
SYSTEM IN THEIR ENDING UP IN

01:43:49.656 --> 01:43:52.926
THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. I

01:43:52.993 --> 01:43:54.962
THINK THE THIRD. SUGGESTION I

01:43:55.028 --> 01:43:56.763
HOUSES THAT IF YOU WITH WE DO

01:43:56.830 --> 01:43:58.899
HAVE THEM KIDS IN THE JUVENILE

01:43:58.966 --> 01:43:59.533
JUSTICE SYSTEM WE REALLY. NEED

01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:02.769
TO RE HALL WHAT WE'RE DOING

01:44:02.836 --> 01:44:03.303
BECAUSE WE HAVE VERY FEW

01:44:03.370 --> 01:44:05.238
OPTIONS. YOU GO HOME OPERATION

01:44:05.305 --> 01:44:07.307
GO TO CIVIL PLACEMENT WHICH IS

01:44:07.374 --> 01:44:09.009
A GROUP HOME WHICH IS A

01:44:09.076 --> 01:44:11.178
TERRIBLE IDEA. YOU CAN GO TO

01:44:11.244 --> 01:44:12.779
CAMP YOU CAN GO TO PRISON.

01:44:12.846 --> 01:44:15.182
THAT'S BASICALLY IT WE REALLY

01:44:15.248 --> 01:44:15.782
DON'T HAVE THE TOOLS THAT WE

01:44:15.849 --> 01:44:19.019
NEED. AND MORE YOU KNOW THAT

01:44:19.086 --> 01:44:20.988
THERE'S MORE THAN ACCESS TO

01:44:21.054 --> 01:44:25.058
SERVICES. WHICH IS A BIG THING.

01:44:25.125 --> 01:44:27.260
I THINK THAT. WHAT WE NEED IS

01:44:27.327 --> 01:44:29.196
THAT WHAT I SAID HARM REDUCTION

01:44:29.262 --> 01:44:30.764
POSITIVE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT

01:44:30.831 --> 01:44:32.966
MODEL I THINK THAT WE NEED TO

01:44:33.033 --> 01:44:35.135
GIVE GIRLS YOUNG WOMEN SELF

01:44:35.202 --> 01:44:38.872
ESTEEM. A SENSE OF EMPOWERMENT

01:44:38.939 --> 01:44:41.174
AND INDEPENDENCE AND

01:44:41.241 --> 01:44:43.110
UNFORTUNATELY OUR JUVENILE

01:44:43.176 --> 01:44:45.345
JUSTICE SYSTEM IS BEING IS

01:44:45.412 --> 01:44:48.882
GEARED TOWARDS SUBMISSION

01:44:48.949 --> 01:44:51.151
OBEDIENCE AND TO A VERY

01:44:51.218 --> 01:44:55.088
PATRIARCHAL. AT A STORE TATE OF

01:44:55.155 --> 01:44:59.126
MODEL. SO THIS IS A SMALL

01:44:59.192 --> 01:45:02.896
LITTLE CHANGES YOU KNOW LET'S

01:45:02.963 --> 01:45:08.935
JUST. CAME THROUGH. THANK YOU

01:45:09.002 --> 01:45:10.771
SO I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU

01:45:10.837 --> 01:45:13.140
FOR YOUR HONESTY AND FOR YOUR

01:45:13.206 --> 01:45:15.142
COURAGE AND BOTH TALKING ABOUT

01:45:15.208 --> 01:45:17.310
YOUR WORK AND THE EFFORTS THAT

01:45:17.377 --> 01:45:19.046
YOU SEE AHEAD WE'RE GOING TO

01:45:19.112 --> 01:45:21.048
NOW OPEN IT UP TO PUBLIC

01:45:21.114 --> 01:45:24.918
COMMENT SO I WANT FOLKS TO KIND

01:45:24.985 --> 01:45:26.820
OF. I GUESS LINE UP HERE WE GO.

01:45:26.887 --> 01:45:30.857
AND WHILE WE DO THAT. I WANT TO

01:45:30.924 --> 01:45:31.391
MAKE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS

01:45:31.458 --> 01:45:35.095
MYSELF. WE HAVE BEEN MAKING

01:45:35.162 --> 01:45:36.897
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE AT THE STATE

01:45:36.963 --> 01:45:37.497
LEVEL BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU

01:45:37.564 --> 01:45:40.801
THAT THE BATTLE IS UP THE HILL

01:45:40.867 --> 01:45:42.803
THERE ARE OVER A HUNDRED AND

01:45:42.869 --> 01:45:44.938
FIFTY SENTENCE ENHANCEMENTS

01:45:45.005 --> 01:45:46.773
THAT ARE STILL ON THE BOOKS AND

01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:48.775
SO WHILE WE TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW

01:45:48.842 --> 01:45:49.376
BILL REFORM THE BIGGEST ISSUE

01:45:49.443 --> 01:45:53.080
IS SENTENCING REFORM. AND OUR

01:45:53.146 --> 01:45:54.948
BIGGEST OPPOSITION ACTUALLY

01:45:55.015 --> 01:45:57.350
COME FROM THAT THE D. A.'S AND

01:45:57.417 --> 01:46:01.555
SO WE THERE'S ALSO WHEN I'M SO

01:46:01.621 --> 01:46:03.056
GLAD THAT YOU MENTIONED THIS IN

01:46:03.123 --> 01:46:05.192
YOUR COMMENTS IT'S AS MUCH

01:46:05.258 --> 01:46:08.895
ABOUT MONEY AND RESOURCES AS IT

01:46:08.962 --> 01:46:10.897
IS ABOUT CULTURE CHANGE BECAUSE

01:46:10.964 --> 01:46:11.431
IT'S REALLY HARD FOR THE

01:46:11.498 --> 01:46:13.266
LEGISLATURE TO SAY I'M GOING TO

01:46:13.333 --> 01:46:15.335
FUND THIS IF WE FEEL LIKE WE'RE

01:46:15.402 --> 01:46:17.170
FUNDING A SYSTEM THAT WE ALL

01:46:17.237 --> 01:46:18.872
KNOW TO BE BROKEN WITHOUT ANY

01:46:18.939 --> 01:46:21.141
ASSURANCES THAT THERE'S GOING

01:46:21.208 --> 01:46:21.742
TO BE SOME SORT OF CULTURAL

01:46:21.808 --> 01:46:23.176
CHANGE IN THE SYSTEM. AND SO

01:46:23.243 --> 01:46:26.880
HOW DO WE HOW DO WE DO THAT AND

01:46:26.947 --> 01:46:30.784
YOU KNOW HOW DO WE ACCEPT AND

01:46:30.851 --> 01:46:32.886
EMBRACE MORE JUDICIAL

01:46:32.953 --> 01:46:35.088
DISCRETION WIN IT REVEALS

01:46:35.155 --> 01:46:37.257
ITSELF IN SENTENCING

01:46:37.324 --> 01:46:40.927
DISPARITIES YOU SEE AND SORROW

01:46:40.994 --> 01:46:42.796
PEOPLE USE DESCRIPTIVE JUDGES

01:46:42.863 --> 01:46:43.396
WILL USE THEIR DISCRETION YOU

01:46:43.463 --> 01:46:45.465
KNOW FOR CERTAIN FOLKS AND NOT

01:46:45.532 --> 01:46:47.234
FOR OTHERS AND I THINK THAT THE

01:46:47.300 --> 01:46:49.369
BROCK TURNER CASE WAS A GREAT

01:46:49.436 --> 01:46:51.037
EXAMPLE OF AN OUTRAGE. WITH A

01:46:51.104 --> 01:46:53.306
JUDGE USING JUDICIAL DISCRETION

01:46:53.373 --> 01:46:55.342
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE ALL IT WAS

01:46:55.408 --> 01:46:58.945
USED FOR THIS WHITE MAN. AND

01:46:59.012 --> 01:46:59.613
NOT IN ANY OTHER CASE THAT WE

01:46:59.679 --> 01:47:03.016
HAVE SEEN IN THAT WAY AND SO

01:47:03.083 --> 01:47:03.517
HOW DO WE REALLY HAVE

01:47:03.583 --> 01:47:06.987
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT RACE AND

01:47:07.053 --> 01:47:07.521
CLASS AND GENDER IN THIS

01:47:07.587 --> 01:47:11.024
SYSTEM. AND THEN THE FINAL

01:47:11.091 --> 01:47:11.691
THING IS YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW

01:47:11.758 --> 01:47:15.228
ABOUT YOU BUT YOU KNOW FIVE

01:47:15.295 --> 01:47:15.796
YEARS ON PROBATION A REALLY

01:47:15.862 --> 01:47:25.005
LONG TIME. I MEAN I CAN HARDLY

01:47:25.071 --> 01:47:25.605
GO TWO WEEKS ON A DIET WITHOUT

01:47:25.672 --> 01:47:27.140
MAKING. IT SO DO YOU THINK

01:47:27.207 --> 01:47:27.774
SOMEONE IS GOING TO GO IF YEARS

01:47:27.841 --> 01:47:28.809
WITHOUT. YOU KNOW IT IT'S

01:47:28.875 --> 01:47:29.342
BREAKING A VIOLATE IT'S A

01:47:29.409 --> 01:47:32.813
VIOLATION OF ANY LAW OF ANY

01:47:32.879 --> 01:47:34.948
LONG JAY WALKING J. WORKING.

01:47:35.015 --> 01:47:37.217
AND SO WE HAVE TO KIND OF HAVE

01:47:37.284 --> 01:47:38.952
REAL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IF

01:47:39.019 --> 01:47:40.987
THAT'S EVEN DESIGNED TO HAVE

01:47:41.054 --> 01:47:42.923
PEOPLE REHABILITATE IF I'M

01:47:42.989 --> 01:47:46.827
BEING WATCHED FOR FIVE YEARS.

01:47:46.893 --> 01:47:48.795
THERE'S NO WAY ON GOD'S GREEN

01:47:48.862 --> 01:47:49.429
EARTH I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY

01:47:49.496 --> 01:47:51.097
KIND OF MISTAKE ON ANY GIVEN

01:47:51.164 --> 01:47:53.233
DAY AND SO WHAT ARE WE REALLY

01:47:53.300 --> 01:47:55.035
TALKING ABOUT. BUT I APPRECIATE

01:47:55.101 --> 01:47:58.872
THE FACT THAT ALL OF US ARE IN

01:47:58.939 --> 01:47:59.472
THIS FIGHT TOGETHER AND WE'RE

01:47:59.539 --> 01:48:01.274
COMING AT IT FROM DIFFERENT

01:48:01.341 --> 01:48:03.143
ANGLES AND WE DO NEED TO

01:48:03.210 --> 01:48:05.178
SUPPORTER DA'S OFFICES AND WE

01:48:05.245 --> 01:48:05.712
NEED TO SUPPORT A PUBLIC

01:48:05.779 --> 01:48:07.147
DEFENDERS BECAUSE SPENDING

01:48:07.214 --> 01:48:09.149
SEVEN MINUTES ON AVERAGE WITH

01:48:09.216 --> 01:48:11.284
THE CLIENT. IS NOT GOING TO GET

01:48:11.351 --> 01:48:12.819
BACK LINE DUE PROCESS I DON'T

01:48:12.886 --> 01:48:13.420
KNOW HOW YOU FIND TO PROCESS

01:48:13.486 --> 01:48:16.957
AND SEVEN MINUTES. AND SO WE

01:48:17.023 --> 01:48:17.390
HAVE TO HAVE A REAL

01:48:17.457 --> 01:48:18.959
CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT. AND

01:48:19.025 --> 01:48:19.559
WHO GETS A PUBLIC DEFENDER AND

01:48:19.626 --> 01:48:24.798
WHO DOESN'T. SO WITH THAT I AM

01:48:24.865 --> 01:48:26.867
GOING TO ALSO SAY THAT THIS IS

01:48:26.933 --> 01:48:28.802
THE FIRST IN A SERIES OF

01:48:28.869 --> 01:48:29.469
HEARINGS ON OUR SECOND ONE WILL

01:48:29.536 --> 01:48:31.037
HAPPEN IN FEBRUARY AND- ALL IN

01:48:31.104 --> 01:48:33.106
THAT HEARING WE WILL ACTUALLY

01:48:33.173 --> 01:48:34.875
DELVE INTO THE EXPERIENCES. OF

01:48:34.941 --> 01:48:38.812
WOMEN WHILE INCARCERATED SO WE

01:48:38.879 --> 01:48:39.379
WILL BE TALKING ABOUT WHAT

01:48:39.446 --> 01:48:41.281
HAPPENS IN PRISON AND IN JAIL

01:48:41.348 --> 01:48:43.149
AND THE TRAUMAS IN THE

01:48:43.216 --> 01:48:45.018
MISTREATMENT BECAUSE WE HAVE TO

01:48:45.085 --> 01:48:46.853
FIX THIS PROBLEM FROM ALL SIDES.

01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:47.454
SO WITH THAT I WANT TO OPEN IT

01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:51.324
UP. PUBLIC COMMENT IF YOU HAVE

01:48:51.391 --> 01:48:54.794
NINETY SECONDS THIS WILL BE

UNDERSTAND HOW PERVASIVE HOW

02:17:38.984 --> 02:17:41.219
PERVASIVE THE INCARCERATION IN

02:17:41.286 --> 02:17:43.254
THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS IN SO

02:17:43.321 --> 02:17:45.290
MANY OF OUR LIVES THERE IS A

02:17:45.357 --> 02:17:48.827
REASON WHY IN NEW YORK THEY'RE

02:17:48.893 --> 02:17:49.394
TALKING ABOUT CLOSING DOWN

02:17:49.461 --> 02:17:51.262
RYKER'S ISLAND NOT BECAUSE THEY

DON'T HAVE ANY MORE

02:17:52.897 --> 02:17:55.100
INCARCERATED FOLKS BUT BECAUSE

02:17:55.166 --> 02:17:57.068
EVERY SINGLE PERSON FROM THE

02:17:57.135 --> 02:17:58.937
MEDICAL DOCTORS TO THE FOLKS

02:17:59.004 --> 02:17:59.537
WHO ARE INCARCERATED TO THE

02:17:59.604 --> 02:18:03.008
VISITORS HAVE BEEN TRAUMATIZED.

02:18:03.074 --> 02:18:04.743
TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THEY

02:18:04.809 --> 02:18:06.878
KNOW THAT THIS IS NO LONGER A

02:18:06.945 --> 02:18:09.014
VIABLE OPTION AND SO THESE

02:18:09.080 --> 02:18:10.982
SERIES OF CONVERSATIONS PUTTING

02:18:11.049 --> 02:18:13.284
WOMEN IN THE SPOTLIGHT. OUR

02:18:13.351 --> 02:18:16.988
ABOUT ASKING US HOW WE WANT TO

02:18:17.055 --> 02:18:19.391
LIVE I WENT WITH THE DELEGATION

02:18:19.457 --> 02:18:22.761
TO NORWAY TO LOOK AT THEIR

02:18:22.827 --> 02:18:24.963
STATE PRISONS THAT WAS

02:18:25.030 --> 02:18:26.765
TRAUMATIZING TO SEE HOW

02:18:26.831 --> 02:18:29.034
DIFFERENTLY THEY TREAT THEIR

02:18:29.100 --> 02:18:31.136
OWN AND THEY SAY. THE COURT IS

02:18:31.202 --> 02:18:36.908
WHERE YOU PUNISH. THE PRISON IS

02:18:36.975 --> 02:18:40.845
WHERE YOU REHABILITATE SO THAT

02:18:40.912 --> 02:18:41.346
PEOPLE CAN BECOME BETTER

02:18:41.413 --> 02:18:45.083
NEIGHBORS. IT IS NOT PUNITIVE

02:18:45.150 --> 02:18:47.285
IT IS NOT DE HUMOR TIME DE

02:18:47.352 --> 02:18:49.087
HUMANIZING. IT IS NOT

02:18:49.154 --> 02:18:53.191
DEMORALIZING. IT IS ABOUT

02:18:53.258 --> 02:18:55.193
HEALING PEOPLE SO THEY CAN COME

02:18:55.260 --> 02:18:57.228
OUT WHOLE SO THAT THEY CAN

02:18:57.295 --> 02:18:58.963
UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE

02:18:59.030 --> 02:19:00.932
IN OUR LOVING RELATIONSHIP TO

02:19:00.999 --> 02:19:01.466
BE IN A JOB WHERE THERE'S

02:19:01.533 --> 02:19:03.334
DIGNITY TO WALK DOWN THE STREET

02:19:03.401 --> 02:19:06.905
AND FEEL WHOLE. AND WE TAKE

02:19:06.971 --> 02:19:09.274
APART HUMANITY PIECE BY PIECE

02:19:09.340 --> 02:19:13.044
WITH EVERY STEP IN THIS SYSTEM

02:19:13.111 --> 02:19:14.913
FROM HOW WE OVER MONITOR FOLKS

02:19:14.979 --> 02:19:16.848
THAT AND HOW WE OVER CHARGE

02:19:16.915 --> 02:19:17.382
THEM TO THEN HOW WE OVER

02:19:17.449 --> 02:19:19.284
SENTENCE THEM TO THEN HOW WE RE

02:19:19.350 --> 02:19:21.186
INCARCERATE AND THEN HOW WE

02:19:21.252 --> 02:19:23.288
DENY ACCESS TO REHABILITATION

02:19:23.354 --> 02:19:27.092
THAT PIPELINE HAS SO MANY

02:19:27.158 --> 02:19:29.027
TENTACLES. THAT DESTROYED

02:19:29.094 --> 02:19:33.031
FAMILIES AND HOPE AND SO I AM

02:19:33.098 --> 02:19:35.066
