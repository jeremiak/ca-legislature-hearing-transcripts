DESPITE THIS INVESTOR WORK ON THE PROJECT HAS CRISIS OFF HOLD BECAUSE OF LITIGATION CLAIMING THE CITY VIOLATED LOCAL INITIALLY KNOWN AS- A- PROHIBITS MANDATED POCKET LABOR.

DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE REGION'S INVESTED ABOUT THREE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS IN THE PAST COUPLE DECADES TO PROMOTE REGIONAL SELF SUFFICIENCY IN THE EMPLOYMENT STATE LONG POLICY TO REDUCE OUR RELIANCE ON THE DELTA AS IF YOU'VE WATER SUPPLY SOURCE WE'RE STILL SUBJECT TO PROLONG DROPPED AND THAT'S DESPITE INVESTMENTS IN WATER TRANSFERS AND REGIONAL SERVICE STORAGE GROW MORE STORAGE AGGRESSIVE WATER CONSERVATION SO MAYBE RECYCLING.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOT SURE MEMBERS THIS IDEA IS ONLY HALF OF THE STATE OF THE CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING THANK YOU YOU KNOW SOMEONE NUMBER IN THE CURRENT TIME FOR US ALL. AS TRYING TO ADDRESS A CRITICAL ISSUE WITH REGARDS TO WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT THE STATE IS A PARTNER WITH THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO THE TRY TO GET THIS PROBLEM UP AND RUNNING. FROM IT DEALS WITH FIXING WHAT WE CALL A POLITICALLY MOTIVATED AND MISSION CAM THOUSAND AND TWELVE. WHERE THE HOME IS A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS WENT TO THE VOTERS TO BASICALLY HAND FELT THE CITY. DID NOT HAVE ANY. PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS AT THE TIME BUT THE BAND THOSE POSH. BOB SAN DIEGO IS A CHARTER CITY WE ARE DEFINITELY ENGAGED IN THAT INITIATIVE AND AN OPPOSITION. BUT NONE THE LESS OF THE PROPONENTS ONE AND TURNED OUT TO BE RATHER A DECEPTIVE CAMPAIGN. AND SO WHAT WE THEN FOLLOWED UP WITH WAS WAS AN INCENTIVE TO BASICALLY CREATE. AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SAN DIEGO TO HAVE THE OPTION OF UTILIZING PROJECT. LABOR AGREEMENTS IF THERE WAS STATE INVOLVEMENT IN. AND SO EVEN THOUGH. THE BILLS WERE PASSED THERE WAS STILL SOME OF DISCUSSIONS OVER HOW THAT INITIATIVE WOULD APPLY FOR STATE FUNDED PROJECTS AND SO. THE UPON AS A PROJECT LABOR UNIONS THEMSELVES AN EFFORT NOT TO BE RESTRICTING THE CITY TO THEIR OWN INITIATIVE FROM ST CALLER TO CLAIM THAT THIS IS THE PROPOSITION ITSELF WOULD ALLOW THAT INVESTMENT TO CONTINUE. NOW THEY'RE SAYING THE OPPOSITE SO THEY CAN'T REALLY HAVE IT BOTH WAYS I CAN SAY FOR ALL YOU CAN USE PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS WHETHER STATE INVESTMENT AND NOW. YEAH DAHLE SUDDEN WHEN THERE'S ACTUALLY. STATE MONEY INVOLVED THEN FORGET ABOUT HOW. THE FACT THIS PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS ARE WIDELY USED BY PRIVATE INDUSTRY. IS WIDELY USED BY PUBLIC AS WELL YOU SEE THE CRANES BEHIND ON THE- SOUTH SIDE OF THE BUILDING ALL OF THOSE FRAMES ARE ARE UNION CRANES THOSE PROJECTS ARE STATE PROJECTS. ALL THE PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS THAT WERE. INSERTED INTO WITH STATE OF BUILDING TRADES COUNCIL WE HAVE FOUR HOUSES WE HAVE SCHOOLS WE HAVE DIFFERENT PROJECTS ACROSS THE STATE WHERE THE LOCAL ENTITIES UTILIZE PROJECT WE WILL BRING TO TRY TO GET MORE MOBILE HIGHER. THEY TRY TO TARGET DISADVANTAGED YOUTH WHEN AND EMANCIPATION FROM THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM AND ALSO RETURNING VETERANS AND SAN DIEGO THAT TO A CRITICAL MUNITY THAT IS ASSISTED GREATLY BY HAVING A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT FOR THOSE WE- ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. SEEING NONE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION OF THE- SHARE MEMBERS MY NAME IS BELIEVE IT LIKE THE CYBER PERCENT THE ASSOCIATED GENERAL CONTRACTORS OF CALIFORNIA THE SAN DIEGO AND CALIFORNIA CHAPTER WE ALREADY THE LARGEST ASSOCIATION IN CALIFORNIA WITH UNION CONTRACTORS THAT HAVE MASTER LABOR AGREEMENTS WITH OUR PARTNERS SUCH AS LABOR'S HANDED THE OPERATION YEARS. WE ALSO REPRESENT NONUNION CONTRACTORS WHO SOURCE THEIR PUBLIC WORK FORCE FROM CERTIFICATED SIX ARE CERTIFICATED. THE I. R. ACCREDITATION PROGRAMS. THIS IS A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE SITUATION YOU'RE TAKEN AGREE MORE WITH THE AUTHOR AND SOME OF YOUR WITNESSES AND THAT THIS PROJECT IS CRITICAL AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT BUT AT THE SAME TIME. IN SAN DIEGO IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THE CITY PASSED AN ORDINANCE OF LED BY THE VOTERS. THAT MADE IT SO THAT THERE WAS A PROHIBITION ON MANDATORY. PROJECT LABOR. NO PROHIBITION ON VOLUNTARY DEAL IS BUT A PROHIBITION ON MANDATORY FIELD. THE INITIATIVE ALSO SAID THAT THERE COULD BE ANY DISCRIMINATION BETWEEN UNION AND NONUNION CONTRACTORS SO LONG AS THEIR WORKFORCE WAS SEALED IN TRAINED AND DEALT WITH CERTIFICATED PROGRAMS SUCH AS- THE ONE THAT AGENCIES SAN DIEGO FOR. WOULD YOU HAVE FOR YOU HERE IS A MEASURE THAT CONDITIONS STATE MONEY. TO THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO FOR THIS ONE PROJECT BASED ON THE NEED OR IN THIS CASE BASED ON THE FACT THAT SAN DIEGO MUST PASS APPEAL LAY GRADING A COLLISION COURSE HERE WITH MEASURE RIGHT. UP UNTIL NOW THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO WAS ABLE TO PROCURE PUT OUT THIS AND THERE WAS NO ISSUE BUT THIS PROJECT YOUR VIOLATE. MEASURE RIGHT THE AUTHOR IN THIS IS IN THIS MEASURE IS ATTEMPTING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY AND I UNDERSTAND WHY. A WAY BY WHICH TO RENDER MEASURE NAY INVALID THE PROBLEM THOUGH IS THAT MEASURE HEY HOW'S. THAT PIECE THAT DEALS WITH THE. DISCRIMINATION PEACE BETWEEN UNION AND NONUNION. SO IF YOU MANDATE APL LAID OUT THERE YOU RUN INTO CONFLICT WITH MEASURE RACE SO WE DON'T BELIEVE. THAT THIS MEASURE UNFORTUNATELY WILL EXPEDITE THE PROCESS THE PROCESS OR WE YOU SHOULD BE UNDER ANY ILLUSION THAT WILL EITHER. YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF ISSUES IN ADDITION TO MEASURE RIGHT. YOU'VE GOT TO THE HEART OF THIS NATURE THAT CHARTER CITIES ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE THEIR HOME RULE WHEN IT COMES TO PREPARING PROJECTS. FURTHERMORE YOU'VE GOT YOU'VE GOT UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT WHEN IT RELATES TO MUNICIPAL AFFAIRS. OWNERS SUCH AS THE CITY SAN DIEGO CAN REGULATE HOW YOU BROKE YOUR PROJECTS BUT REGULATORS AND FUNDERS SUCH AS A STATE IN THIS CASE DON'T HAVE THAT ABILITY SO THE DISTINCTION I THINK IS ONE THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THAT FACT WERE UNDER NO ILLUSION THAT THIS MEASURE HAS TREMENDOUS SUPPORT AND POLITICAL FORCE BEHIND IT BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT'S OR EXHORTATION THAT THIS WILL CONTINUE THE LITIGATION AND FURTHER SOLVE THIS PRO ABOUT. THIS PROJECT SO FOR. THOSE REASONS WE URGE AND OPPOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THE ANY OTHER OPPOSITION. SINGER ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. YES. ALL OF THIS YEAR'S OR POLITICAL. IT SAYS THIS IS YOUR INITIATIVE IS A POLITICAL ONE IT WAS NOT YOUR INITIATIVE IS LIKE ONE OF THE POLITICAL ONE. SO IT ALSO I FOLLOWED. HEY QUITE CLOSELY EVEN THOUGH IT WAS OUT OF MY JURISDICTION IN ANOTHER CITY. AND. IT WAS APPROVED BY 58% OF THE VOTE. SO SAN DIEGO WANTED TO MAINTAIN THE FREEDOM FROM THE LA IS IN ORDER TO LOWER THE PRICE OF DIFFERENT. PROJECTS NOW I SELDOM YOU'LL BE KILLED THE GREAT I SELDOM GO AGAINST THE WATER PEOPLE BECAUSE I LOVE YOU OKAY YOU DO REALLY GREAT WORK IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY. OF WE SPENT ALMOST ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. IMPROVING OUR WHOLE WATER SYSTEM STORAGE EXCEPTION. INCLUDING DESALINATION AND OTHER THINGS THAT OUR FUTURE MAYOR WITH APPROVED. LET'S DO COLLEAGUES IS. THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR'S BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS ONLY TWELVE POINT 8% OF THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN PRIVATE CONSTRUCTION WORKFORCE BELONG TO A UNION THAT MEANS EIGHT OUT OF TEN CONSTRUCTION WORKERS DO NOT BELONG TO A UNION YOU WOULD BE PRECLUDING THAT. THAT'S WHY THE LAWSUIT IS THE LAWSUIT. ALSO IT'S BEEN PROVEN BY VARIOUS TAXPAYER FUNDED SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS. THAT THE OLD WAYS AND 12218% WHEN COMPARED TO SIMILAR PROJECTS NOT REQUIRING DELAYS AND THEN JUST OF WRAP THIS UP WE'VE HEARD FROM ASSOCIATED GENERAL CONTRACTORS BUT ALSO IN OPPOSITION IS THE SAKE OF SAN DIEGO CHAPTER. INDEPENDENT ROOFING CONTRACTORS AND THE WESTERN ALLIES. THANK YOU THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. OKAY IN NEW TO ENTERTAIN A MOTION. MOVIE BILL.
