00:41:23.147 --> 00:41:27.251 region:rollup2
I GUESS THE ONLY OTHER QUESTION

00:41:24.282 --> 00:41:29.354 region:rollup2
I WOULD HAVE MR LOW IS. THAT

00:41:27.251 --> 00:41:29.921 region:rollup2
THERE IS ALREADY A PROVISION IN

00:41:29.354 --> 00:41:31.723 region:rollup2
THE LAW THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR

TO NOT GET YOU PAYMENT FOR YOUR

00:41:43.201 --> 00:41:47.472 region:rollup2

SUCH AS SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL

00:41:47.472 --> 00:41:50.375 region:rollup2

FEDERATION HERE IN OPPOSITION.

00:51:35.125 --> 00:51:38.162 region:rollup2
THIS IS A BILL THAT.

00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:39.530 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP EVERY YEAR

00:51:38.162 --> 00:51:40.731 region:rollup2
THAT I'VE BEEN HERE WHICH IS

00:51:39.530 --> 00:51:42.132 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN YEARS NOW.

00:51:40.731 --> 00:51:44.034 region:rollup2
AND A BILL THAT WE HAVE ALWAYS

00:51:42.132 --> 00:51:46.370 region:rollup2
OPPOSED.

00:51:44.034 --> 00:51:48.138 region:rollup2
FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THE MOST

00:51:46.370 --> 00:51:48.739 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE THING THAT ALLOWS

00:51:48.138 --> 00:51:49.807 region:rollup2
PARENTS TO COME HOME TO THEIR

00:51:48.739 --> 00:51:51.241 region:rollup2
KIDS

00:51:49.807 --> 00:51:52.943 region:rollup2
AT THE END OF THE DAY IS THE

00:51:51.241 --> 00:51:54.511 region:rollup2
EIGHT HOUR WORK DAY. THAT IS

00:51:52.943 --> 00:51:56.714 region:rollup2
WHAT ENSURES THAT THE EMPLOYER

00:51:54.511 --> 00:51:58.949 region:rollup2
HAS A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO LET

00:51:56.714 --> 00:52:01.885 region:rollup2
YOU LEAVE.

00:51:58.949 --> 00:52:02.453 region:rollup2
WHEN WE ASK THAT WORKERS. AND BE

00:52:01.885 --> 00:52:03.420 region:rollup2
PUT IN A POSITION WHERE THEY

00:52:02.453 --> 00:52:06.023 region:rollup2
CAN.

00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:07.524 region:rollup2
WAVE THESE CORE RIGHTS

00:52:06.023 --> 00:52:09.326 region:rollup2
THERE'S A FEW THINGS THAT MAKE

00:52:07.524 --> 00:52:11.996 region:rollup2
THAT A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE.

00:52:09.326 --> 00:52:14.064 region:rollup2
ONE IS THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF

00:52:11.996 --> 00:52:15.532 region:rollup2
WORKERS ARE OUT WELL CAN BE

00:52:14.064 --> 00:52:17.101 region:rollup2
TERMINATED FOR ANY REASON.

00:52:15.532 --> 00:52:18.802 region:rollup2
I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS BILL HAS

00:52:17.101 --> 00:52:20.771 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE IT SAYS THE EMPLOYER

00:52:18.802 --> 00:52:22.740 region:rollup2
CANNOT AND.

00:52:20.771 --> 00:52:23.907 region:rollup2
PRESSURE YOU TO DO THIS OR OR I

00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:25.843 region:rollup2
RETALIATES AGAINST YOU IF YOU

00:52:23.907 --> 00:52:28.379 region:rollup2
DON'T DO IT BUT IN THE NORMAL

00:52:25.843 --> 00:52:29.980 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE. THOSE KINDS OF

00:52:28.379 --> 00:52:32.182 region:rollup2
MESSAGES ARE SENT TO WORKERS ALL

00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:34.051 region:rollup2
THE TIME IF YOU'RE A TEAM PLAYER

00:52:32.182 --> 00:52:35.486 region:rollup2
MOST OF US HERE WE WAIVE THE

00:52:34.051 --> 00:52:36.720 region:rollup2
RIGHT TO DAILY OVERTIME ITS.

00:52:35.486 --> 00:52:39.056 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY THIS IS A GREAT

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:41.425 region:rollup2
THING MOST WORKERS DO WHAT THEIR

00:52:39.056 --> 00:52:42.893 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS ASK THEM TO DO SUGGEST

00:52:41.425 --> 00:52:45.195 region:rollup2
THAT THEY SHOULD DO WHAT OTHER

00:52:42.893 --> 00:52:46.463 region:rollup2
WORKERS SAY HELPS YOU GET AHEAD.

00:52:45.195 --> 00:52:47.998 region:rollup2
ON OUT THE JOBBER HOPES TO KEEP

00:52:46.463 --> 00:52:49.366 region:rollup2
THE JOB.

00:52:47.998 --> 00:52:50.668 region:rollup2
SO WE THINK THAT ALLOW IT

00:52:49.366 --> 00:52:52.202 region:rollup2
CREATING A SCENARIO WHERE

00:52:50.668 --> 00:52:54.004 region:rollup2
WORKERS CAN WAVE HE'S VERY QUEER

00:52:52.202 --> 00:52:55.773 region:rollup2
RIGHTS IS DANGEROUS NOT ONLY

00:52:54.004 --> 00:52:57.474 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WORKERS HAVE SO FEW

00:52:55.773 --> 00:52:58.876 region:rollup2
PROTECTIONS. BUT BECAUSE ON THE

00:52:57.474 --> 00:53:00.844 region:rollup2
FLIP SIDE THERE IS THE THE

00:52:58.876 --> 00:53:02.913 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL FOR HUGE FINANCIAL

00:53:00.844 --> 00:53:04.481 region:rollup2
SAVINGS FOR THE EMPLOYER SO WHEN

00:53:02.913 --> 00:53:06.417 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE THAT IMBALANCE YOU HAVE

00:53:04.481 --> 00:53:08.218 region:rollup2
HUGE. ARE INCENTIVES FOR THE

00:53:06.417 --> 00:53:09.286 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER TO TRY TO CUT. UM'S THE

00:53:08.218 --> 00:53:11.188 region:rollup2
COSTS

00:53:09.286 --> 00:53:12.956 region:rollup2
BY GETTING WORKERS TO WAVE DAILY

00:53:11.188 --> 00:53:14.725 region:rollup2
OVERTIME AND YOU HAVE WORKERS

00:53:12.956 --> 00:53:15.993 region:rollup2
WHO FEAR LOSING THEIR JOBS SO

00:53:14.725 --> 00:53:17.494 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE CONCERNS AROUND THE

00:53:15.993 --> 00:53:19.930 region:rollup2
KIND OF VOLUNTARINESS WE DON'T

00:53:17.494 --> 00:53:21.498 region:rollup2
THINK. MOST THINGS CAN BE DONE

00:53:19.930 --> 00:53:23.300 region:rollup2
VOLUNTARILY IN THAT SETTING.

00:53:21.498 --> 00:53:24.368 region:rollup2
BEYOND THAT HERE'S THE OTHER

00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:26.336 region:rollup2
PIECE THAT I THINK IS REALLY

00:53:24.368 --> 00:53:27.871 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT FIRST OF ALL NOTHING

00:53:26.336 --> 00:53:29.473 region:rollup2
IN THIS BILL AND NOTHING IN ANY

00:53:27.871 --> 00:53:30.941 region:rollup2
OF THE BILLS THAT HAS EVER BEEN

00:53:29.473 --> 00:53:33.777 region:rollup2
INTRODUCED. HAS EVER GIVEN

00:53:30.941 --> 00:53:36.080 region:rollup2
WORKERS THE CHOICE TO GET

00:53:33.777 --> 00:53:37.681 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY YOU CAN ASK BUT IT'S

00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:39.616 region:rollup2
THE EMPLOYER'S DECISION WHETHER

00:53:37.681 --> 00:53:40.584 region:rollup2
OR NOT THEY GRANT THAT. SO

00:53:39.616 --> 00:53:42.152 region:rollup2
OFTENTIMES THESE BILLS ARE

00:53:40.584 --> 00:53:43.487 region:rollup2
TALKED ABOUT AS GIVING SOME KIND

00:53:42.152 --> 00:53:45.022 region:rollup2
OF FLEXIBILITY THAT THEY DON'T

00:53:43.487 --> 00:53:46.356 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY GIVE IT IS THE

00:53:45.022 --> 00:53:48.258 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER'S CHOICE.

00:53:46.356 --> 00:53:49.893 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW UNDER EXISTING LAW

00:53:48.258 --> 00:53:51.729 region:rollup2
THERE ARE NUMEROUS WAYS TO HAVE

00:53:49.893 --> 00:53:53.163 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY. THERE IS AN

VIGOROUSLY PEOPLE DIED.

00:58:27.104 --> 00:58:30.374 region:rollup2

00:58:30.374 --> 00:58:33.844 region:rollup2
AND SO YOU KNOW THE THE LABOR

00:58:32.843 --> 00:58:36.113 region:rollup2
MOVEMENT THAT BOB FOR THE

00:58:33.844 --> 00:58:37.981 region:rollup2
WEEKEND TO A IT WAS A STRUGGLE

00:58:36.113 --> 00:58:39.549 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK THAT OFTENTIMES.

00:58:37.981 --> 00:58:41.351 region:rollup2
WE TAKE FOR GRANTED BECAUSE WE

00:58:39.549 --> 00:58:42.019 region:rollup2
AND HOW TO DO THE STRUGGLE TO

00:58:41.351 --> 00:58:43.353 region:rollup2
GET THERE IT'S BEEN A MATTER OF

00:58:42.019 --> 00:58:44.955 region:rollup2
FACT. THERE'S A REASON WHY IT'S

00:58:43.353 --> 00:58:45.522 region:rollup2
A MATTER OF FACT IT IS SO THAT

00:58:44.955 --> 00:58:46.323 region:rollup2
PEOPLE CAN GO HOME TO THEIR

00:58:45.522 --> 00:58:48.458 region:rollup2
CHILDREN.

00:58:46.323 --> 00:58:49.693 region:rollup2
AFTER WORKING FOR EIGHT HOURS

00:58:48.458 --> 00:58:51.261 region:rollup2

00:58:49.693 --> 00:58:53.497 region:rollup2
THEY GET PAID FOR THAT.

00:58:51.261 --> 00:58:55.699 region:rollup2
THE REALITY IS THAT THERE IS AN

00:58:53.497 --> 00:58:57.667 region:rollup2
IMBALANCE AND THE POWER BETWEEN

00:58:55.699 --> 00:59:00.270 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER AND THAT WILL EMPLOYEE.

00:58:57.667 --> 00:59:02.406 region:rollup2
AND A TO SUGGEST OTHERWISE IS

00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:05.375 region:rollup2
JUST NOT BEEN AS IT'S JUST NOT

00:59:02.406 --> 00:59:06.710 region:rollup2
REALITY. AND FOR ANY SITUATION

00:59:05.375 --> 00:59:08.078 region:rollup2
SOMEWHAT HAS MEDICAL EMERGENCIES

00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:09.046 region:rollup2
WE'LL HAVE YOU OUT IS ABSOLUTELY

00:59:08.078 --> 00:59:10.781 region:rollup2
SUMMER SICKLY BICU GIVE HOW

00:59:09.046 --> 00:59:11.782 region:rollup2
MUCH VACATION HOURS INDICATION

00:59:10.781 --> 00:59:12.482 region:rollup2
DAYS YOU GIVE A YEAR.

00:59:11.782 --> 00:59:14.151 region:rollup2
SO MANY OF THOSE EMPLOY

00:59:12.482 --> 00:59:15.619 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS DON'T GET HARDLY ANY

00:59:14.151 --> 00:59:18.288 region:rollup2
IF AT ALL.

00:59:15.619 --> 00:59:19.423 region:rollup2
I AND YOU CAN SAY IT'S VOLUNTARY

00:59:18.288 --> 00:59:20.657 region:rollup2
BUT THEN OF THE DAY IF YOU ARE

00:59:19.423 --> 00:59:22.959 region:rollup2
THREE EMPLOYEES ARE GOING TO GO

00:59:20.657 --> 00:59:23.894 region:rollup2
TO THE FORTY HOUR. FOUR DAY WORK

00:59:22.959 --> 00:59:25.862 region:rollup2
WEEK AND YOU'RE THE ONE THAT

00:59:23.894 --> 00:59:27.330 region:rollup2
DOESN'T. AND YOU'RE OUT WELL HOW

00:59:25.862 --> 00:59:28.999 region:rollup2
MUCH LONGER YOU GONNA BE THERE.

00:59:27.330 --> 00:59:29.833 region:rollup2
I'M NOT VERY LONG AND I WOULD

00:59:28.999 --> 00:59:30.667 region:rollup2
ALSO SUGGEST THAT THOSE THAT

00:59:29.833 --> 00:59:32.068 region:rollup2
WORK.

00:59:30.667 --> 00:59:33.336 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU LOOK AT IT NOW

00:59:32.068 --> 00:59:35.005 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY IN RECENT YEARS IN

00:59:33.336 --> 00:59:36.807 region:rollup2
THIS REALLY BOTHERS ME. AS

00:59:35.005 --> 00:59:39.276 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH OF LOW WAGE WORKERS OUR

00:59:36.807 --> 00:59:40.777 region:rollup2
THAT ARE REQUIRED THE EITHER

00:59:39.276 --> 00:59:42.579 region:rollup2
TEKELI OPTIONAL BUT THEY WORK TO

00:59:40.777 --> 00:59:45.182 region:rollup2
THE HOLIDAYS AND THEY WORK ON

00:59:42.579 --> 00:59:45.682 region:rollup2
BLACK FRIDAY THEY WORK ON THE

00:59:45.182 --> 00:59:47.651 region:rollup2
THANKSGIVING DAY MAY BE

00:59:45.682 --> 00:59:49.653 region:rollup2
COMPENSATED FOR IT. BUT THE END

00:59:47.651 --> 00:59:51.755 region:rollup2
OF THE DAY THAT SPEAKS TO THE

00:59:49.653 --> 00:59:53.957 region:rollup2
IMBALANCE IN THE POWER. THAT THE

00:59:51.755 --> 00:59:56.326 region:rollup2
WORKER HAS WITH THE EMPLOYER AND

00:59:53.957 --> 00:59:58.562 region:rollup2
I REALLY HOPE THAT EMPLOYERS AT

00:59:56.326 --> 01:00:00.263 region:rollup2
THEIR TRULY SINCERE. AND CARE

00:59:58.562 --> 01:00:01.398 region:rollup2
ABOUT FLEXIBILITY FOR THEIR

01:00:00.263 --> 01:00:02.966 region:rollup2
WORKERS WOULD CONSIDER GETTING

01:00:01.398 --> 01:00:05.602 region:rollup2
MORE SICK DAYS MORE VACATION

01:00:02.966 --> 01:00:07.070 region:rollup2
DAYS AND THAT IF THEY DID HAVE A

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:08.538 region:rollup2
LOVED ONE THAT WAS SICK.

WHAT THE GOVERNOR SAID IS I

01:30:25.153 --> 01:30:27.322 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THESE TYPES OF CLAIMS

01:31:26.014 --> 01:31:29.784 region:rollup2
TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT.

IT WAS EXTRAORDINARILY

COURAGEOUS AT THE TIME.

TO PUT.

01:31:36.691 --> 01:31:39.060 region:rollup2
AT YOUR JOB ON THE LINE AND

OPPORTUNITY TO HOST OF THESE ON

01:31:49.504 --> 01:31:53.375 region:rollup2
ONE OCCASION SCREENINGS OF RAPE

01:31:51.673 --> 01:31:54.809 region:rollup2
ON THE NIGHT SHIFT AND. THOSE

01:31:53.375 --> 01:31:56.978 region:rollup2
VERY POWERFUL VERY MOVING AND

01:31:54.809 --> 01:31:59.180 region:rollup2
CLEARLY LEAD TO REAL ACTION BY

01:31:56.978 --> 01:32:01.016 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE AND NOW GONNA

01:31:59.180 --> 01:32:02.784 region:rollup2
POST THE INITIATION OF THE NEED

01:32:01.016 --> 01:32:03.785 region:rollup2
TO MOVEMENT. I THINK IS MORE

01:32:02.784 --> 01:32:04.319 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THAN EVER THAT WE

01:32:03.785 --> 01:32:07.055 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO LISTEN TO THE

01:32:04.319 --> 01:32:09.958 region:rollup2
VOICES.

01:32:07.055 --> 01:32:11.059 region:rollup2
THOSE WHO ARE VICTIMS OF ASSAULT

01:32:09.958 --> 01:32:13.228 region:rollup2
I KNOW ITS.

01:32:11.059 --> 01:32:14.996 region:rollup2
UNLIKELY A COINCIDENCE THAT

01:32:13.228 --> 01:32:15.864 region:rollup2
THIS BILL IS HERE BEFORE US

01:32:14.996 --> 01:32:17.365 region:rollup2
TODAY ON DENIM DAY.

01:32:15.864 --> 01:32:18.933 region:rollup2
BUT EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY THAN

01:32:17.365 --> 01:32:20.335 region:rollup2
THE SYMBOLIC ASPECT OF THAT IS

01:32:18.933 --> 01:32:22.604 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO THAT

01:32:20.335 --> 01:32:24.639 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIVE. AYE AYES SINCERELY

01:32:22.604 --> 01:32:26.408 region:rollup2
DO NOT BELIEVE. THAT.

01:32:24.639 --> 01:32:28.676 region:rollup2
IT'S.

01:32:26.408 --> 01:32:30.578 region:rollup2
OVERLY BURDENSOME TO ADD AN

01:32:28.676 --> 01:32:31.880 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL PEER COUNSELOR TO THE

01:32:30.578 --> 01:32:32.847 region:rollup2
TRAINING THAT'S NOT DUPLICATIVE

01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:34.783 region:rollup2
AT ALL I THINK THAT IF THERE'S A

01:32:32.847 --> 01:32:36.017 region:rollup2
SENSE.

01:32:34.783 --> 01:32:36.651 region:rollup2
FROM ANYONE ELSE THAT IS

01:32:36.017 --> 01:32:37.719 region:rollup2
DUPLICATIVE I DON'T THAT THEY

01:32:36.651 --> 01:32:38.586 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND WHAT APPEARED COUNCIL

01:32:37.719 --> 01:32:40.021 region:rollup2
REFORMATORY AT.

01:32:38.586 --> 01:32:42.557 region:rollup2
PREMATURE DOES.

01:32:40.021 --> 01:32:43.992 region:rollup2
AND A SENSE OF CONNECTEDNESS

01:32:42.557 --> 01:32:46.294 region:rollup2
THAT IS OBSOLETE NESTLE SPECIAL

01:32:43.992 --> 01:32:46.528 region:rollup2
MORE TALKING ABOUT SEXUAL

01:32:46.294 --> 01:32:48.029 region:rollup2
ASSAULT.

01:32:46.528 --> 01:32:48.930 region:rollup2
.

01:32:48.029 --> 01:32:50.231 region:rollup2
AND TO SUGGEST THAT SOMEHOW ON

01:32:48.930 --> 01:32:51.733 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER DOESN'T KNOW HOW MANY

01:32:50.231 --> 01:32:53.268 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES IT HAS. OR THAT WHEN

01:32:51.733 --> 01:32:55.003 region:rollup2
THEY'RE THEY'RE PUTTING TOGETHER

01:32:53.268 --> 01:32:56.304 region:rollup2
CONTRAST HUNDRED OF THOUSANDS OR

01:32:55.003 --> 01:32:58.773 region:rollup2
EVEN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

01:32:56.304 --> 01:32:59.941 region:rollup2
IN CONTRACTING OUT SERVICES FOR

01:32:58.773 --> 01:33:01.509 region:rollup2
JANITORIAL SERVICES THAT THEY

01:32:59.941 --> 01:33:03.211 region:rollup2
CAN ADD ONE SIMPLE LINE A BY THE

01:33:01.509 --> 01:33:04.446 region:rollup2
WAY CAN YOU PROVIDE US

01:33:03.211 --> 01:33:05.947 region:rollup2
INFORMATION HOW MAY EMPLOYEES

01:33:04.446 --> 01:33:08.183 region:rollup2
HAVE AND WHERE THEY'RE LOCATED.

01:33:05.947 --> 01:33:09.184 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT'S INTERESTING THAT

01:33:08.183 --> 01:33:10.351 region:rollup2
THE SUGGEST THAT SOME OF THESE

01:33:09.184 --> 01:33:12.020 region:rollup2
ARE HAPLESS EMPLOYERS THEY DON'T

01:33:10.351 --> 01:33:13.922 region:rollup2
REALLY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

01:33:12.020 --> 01:33:15.924 region:rollup2
BUT THEIR WORK FORCES JUST THE

01:33:13.922 --> 01:33:17.926 region:rollup2
IT TOTALLY FALLS FLAT. I THINK

01:33:15.924 --> 01:33:21.329 region:rollup2
THIS IS A KIND OF. THIS IS THE

01:33:17.926 --> 01:33:21.563 region:rollup2
KIND OF ISSUE WHERE IT WOULD

01:33:21.329 --> 01:33:22.497 region:rollup2
REALLY.

01:33:21.563 --> 01:33:23.298 region:rollup2
.

01:33:22.497 --> 01:33:24.899 region:rollup2
AYE I THINK BEHOOVE EMPLOYERS

01:33:23.298 --> 01:33:26.601 region:rollup2
TO GET ON BOARD AND SAY THIS IS

01:33:24.899 --> 01:33:27.569 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN EASILY DO

01:33:26.601 --> 01:33:29.737 region:rollup2
TO SUPPORT.

01:33:27.569 --> 01:33:31.139 region:rollup2
THE WORKERS THAT ARE SUFFERING

01:33:29.737 --> 01:33:31.906 region:rollup2
THAT ARE SUFFERING TODAY HAVE

01:33:31.139 --> 01:33:33.374 region:rollup2
BEEN SUFFERING FOR MANY MANY

01:33:31.906 --> 01:33:35.343 region:rollup2
YEARS AND IT'S FRANKLY

01:33:33.374 --> 01:33:37.145 region:rollup2
DISAPPOINTING. THAT.

01:33:35.343 --> 01:33:39.180 region:rollup2
ON AN ISSUE LIKE THIS.

01:33:37.145 --> 01:33:40.548 region:rollup2
THOUGH THE FACT THEY HAVE TO

01:33:39.180 --> 01:33:42.016 region:rollup2
PAY TWENTY FIVE BUCKS AN HOUR

01:33:40.548 --> 01:33:43.518 region:rollup2
HOPE FOR ACCOUNTS ARE TO COME IN

01:33:42.016 --> 01:33:44.786 region:rollup2
WITH THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE TO

01:33:43.518 --> 01:33:47.822 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY PROVIDE DATA.

01:33:44.786 --> 01:33:49.157 region:rollup2
IS IS CONSIDERED AN OBSTACLE

01:33:47.822 --> 01:33:50.592 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN.

01:33:49.157 --> 01:33:51.159 region:rollup2
DAMN BEING PROACTIVE IN

01:33:50.592 --> 01:33:52.894 region:rollup2
PROTECTING THE VICTIMS THAT

01:33:51.159 --> 01:33:54.128 region:rollup2
WORK.

01:33:52.894 --> 01:33:55.997 region:rollup2
IN THERE COMPANIES THAT WORK ON

01:33:54.128 --> 01:33:58.066 region:rollup2
SITE.

01:33:55.997 --> 01:33:59.200 region:rollup2
THAT CLEAN THEIR FACILITIES ARE

01:33:58.066 --> 01:33:59.667 region:rollup2
I WOULD HOPE THAT YOU KNOW I

01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:01.336 region:rollup2
KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF

01:33:59.667 --> 01:34:02.170 region:rollup2
DISCRIMINATORY ISSUES HERE

01:34:01.336 --> 01:34:04.239 region:rollup2
SOMETIME JUST LABOR BUSINESS

BILL.

01:35:12.273 --> 01:35:16.644 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I I JUST THINK WHETHER

IT'S A VOLUNTEER OR WHETHER THEY

01:35:16.644 --> 01:35:19.847 region:rollup2

PROVIDING THE TRAINING AND I'M

01:35:23.918 --> 01:35:26.888 region:rollup2
KIND OF THE GUIDANCE ALONG THE

01:35:24.819 --> 01:35:27.922 region:rollup2
WAY.

01:35:26.888 --> 01:35:30.458 region:rollup2
SO I.

01:35:27.922 --> 01:35:31.025 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY FOR THAT REASON I

01:35:30.458 --> 01:35:32.727 region:rollup2

01:35:46.507 --> 01:35:50.011 region:rollup2
UNCOMFORTABLE BUT I DO AND THE

01:35:48.109 --> 01:35:50.244 region:rollup2
REASONING FOR THAT IS. THESE

01:35:50.011 --> 01:35:52.080 region:rollup2

01:35:50.244 --> 01:35:53.414 region:rollup2

TO THE OPPOSITION YOU KNOW

01:36:06.494 --> 01:36:09.464 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY KEEP BRINGING UP A

01:36:07.729 --> 01:36:10.431 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT BILL ABOUT WHY NOT PUT

01:36:09.464 --> 01:36:11.733 region:rollup2

THINGS THAT WORK THAT HASN'T

01:36:32.987 --> 01:36:36.324 region:rollup2

WORKER TO GO TO THE LABOR

01:36:40.695 --> 01:36:43.498 region:rollup2
COMMISSIONER. WHICH MAY BE MORE

01:36:41.896 --> 01:36:44.065 region:rollup2
COMFORTABLE SPOT THAN ACTUALLY

NATIONALLY BUT I THINK.

01:41:13.434 --> 01:41:18.139 region:rollup2
FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AS

01:41:16.103 --> 01:41:19.674 region:rollup2
IT RELATES TO NOT JUST THE

01:41:18.139 --> 01:41:21.309 region:rollup2
ECONOMY.

01:41:19.674 --> 01:41:23.177 region:rollup2
SECURITY OF OUR COMMUNITIES.

01:41:21.309 --> 01:41:25.613 region:rollup2

01:41:26.514 --> 01:41:29.216 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

01:41:27.748 --> 01:41:31.352 region:rollup2
A DATA OVER THE LAST THREE TO

01:41:31.352 --> 01:41:34.789 region:rollup2
LESS IMMIGRANTS ENTERING THE U.

S. AND SPECIFICALLY CALIFORNIA

01:41:34.789 --> 01:41:37.258 region:rollup2
ANNUALLY AND DURING THE KEY

01:41:36.223 --> 01:41:39.193 region:rollup2
TIMES IN AGRICULTURE AND SERVICE

01:41:37.258 --> 01:41:40.328 region:rollup2
INDUSTRIES.

01:41:39.193 --> 01:41:41.662 region:rollup2
THIS REDUCTION AND IMMIGRANTS

01:41:40.328 --> 01:41:42.897 region:rollup2
ENTERING THE U. S. IN CALIFORNIA

01:41:41.662 --> 01:41:44.665 region:rollup2
HAS RESULTED IN A SMALLER

01:41:42.897 --> 01:41:45.399 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE AVAILABLE TO WORK IN

01:41:44.665 --> 01:41:47.301 region:rollup2

MORE SPECIFICALLY THIS REDUCTION

01:41:49.070 --> 01:41:52.006 region:rollup2
IN THE READY AND WILLING

01:41:50.538 --> 01:41:53.040 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE IN THE AGRICULTURE AND

SERVICE INDUSTRIES HAS RESULTED

01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:56.043 region:rollup2
IN LABOR SHORTAGES FOR THESE TWO

01:41:55.009 --> 01:41:57.678 region:rollup2
KEY INDUSTRIES IN OUR STATE'S

01:41:56.043 --> 01:41:59.747 region:rollup2
ECONOMY.

01:41:57.678 --> 01:42:01.782 region:rollup2
OR THE SAME TIME PERIOD WE HAVE

01:41:59.747 --> 01:42:03.250 region:rollup2
SEEN INCREASES IN THE WAGES PAID

01:42:01.782 --> 01:42:04.952 region:rollup2
TO FARMWORKERS FOR CERTAIN CROPS

01:42:03.250 --> 01:42:06.587 region:rollup2
AND REGIONS IN THE STATE. WE'VE

01:42:04.952 --> 01:42:08.022 region:rollup2
ALSO SEEN AG EMPLOYERS IMPROVING

01:42:06.587 --> 01:42:09.724 region:rollup2
WORKING CONDITIONS AND AN

01:42:08.022 --> 01:42:10.324 region:rollup2
EMERGENCE OF HEALTH AND OTHER

01:42:09.724 --> 01:42:11.559 region:rollup2
BENEFITS THAT COME ALONG WITH

01:42:10.324 --> 01:42:12.693 region:rollup2
IT.

01:42:11.559 --> 01:42:14.929 region:rollup2
DESPITE THESE EFFORTS WE HAVE

01:42:12.693 --> 01:42:16.731 region:rollup2
NOT SEEN ONE STUDY NATIONWIDE

01:42:14.929 --> 01:42:18.132 region:rollup2
NOR DATA FROM ANY STATE THAT A

SUBSTANTIAL AG AND SERVICE

01:42:18.132 --> 01:42:21.702 region:rollup2
INDUSTRIES AND HAS FOUND THAT U.

01:42:19.934 --> 01:42:23.437 region:rollup2
S. BORN WORKERS. ARE MOVING TO

01:42:21.702 --> 01:42:25.206 region:rollup2

THE U. S. BORN WORKERS SIMPLY IS

01:42:26.841 --> 01:42:30.511 region:rollup2
NOT ATTRACTED TO WORKING IN THE

01:42:27.942 --> 01:42:31.112 region:rollup2
AG OR SERVICE INDUSTRIES DESPITE

01:42:30.511 --> 01:42:32.213 region:rollup2
THE INCREASE IN WAGES THAT WE

01:42:31.112 --> 01:42:33.080 region:rollup2
HAVE SEEN.

01:42:32.213 --> 01:42:34.749 region:rollup2
REPORTED IN NEWSPAPERS

01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:36.150 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE NATION.

01:42:34.749 --> 01:42:37.551 region:rollup2
I HAVE HEARD FROM GROWERS IN THE

01:42:36.150 --> 01:42:39.520 region:rollup2
COACHELLA VALLEY THROUGHOUT THE

01:42:37.551 --> 01:42:41.022 region:rollup2
SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND SALINAS

01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:42.289 region:rollup2
VALLEY THAT THE LACK OF LABOR

01:42:41.022 --> 01:42:44.125 region:rollup2
HAS CAUSED THEM TO LEAVE CROPS

01:42:42.289 --> 01:42:45.960 region:rollup2
ON THE VINES. ON TREES AND IN

01:42:44.125 --> 01:42:47.928 region:rollup2
THE FIELD ENSUING IN SUBSTANTIAL

01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:49.930 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES.

01:42:47.928 --> 01:42:51.399 region:rollup2
AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FIVE IS A

01:42:49.930 --> 01:42:52.700 region:rollup2
BIPARTISAN BILL DESIGNED TO

01:42:51.399 --> 01:42:53.267 region:rollup2
ADDRESS TO LABOR SHORTAGES IN

THE AGRICULTURE AND SERVICE

01:42:53.267 --> 01:42:55.970 region:rollup2
INDUSTRIES.

01:42:54.702 --> 01:42:58.072 region:rollup2
IT WOULD CREATE A WORKING GROUP

01:42:55.970 --> 01:42:59.740 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD COME UP WITH THE BEST

01:42:58.072 --> 01:43:01.275 region:rollup2
WAYS TO IMPLEMENT AND OPERATE. A

01:42:59.740 --> 01:43:02.910 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA RESIDENT WORKER

01:43:01.275 --> 01:43:04.812 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AND WITH THE GOVERNOR'S

01:43:02.910 --> 01:43:06.614 region:rollup2
APPROVAL WOULD SUBMIT THE REPORT

01:43:04.812 --> 01:43:08.349 region:rollup2
TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

01:43:06.614 --> 01:43:09.083 region:rollup2
I'D LIKE TO TAKE SOME TIME TO

01:43:08.349 --> 01:43:10.051 region:rollup2

01:43:09.083 --> 01:43:11.986 region:rollup2
THE BILL.

01:43:10.051 --> 01:43:13.120 region:rollup2
FIRST OFF

01:43:11.986 --> 01:43:14.922 region:rollup2
THE BILL WILL NOT CREATE A GUEST

01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:16.690 region:rollup2
WORKER PROGRAM IT WOULD CREATE A

01:43:14.922 --> 01:43:18.092 region:rollup2
RESIDENT WORKER PROGRAM FOR

01:43:16.690 --> 01:43:19.226 region:rollup2
THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN LIVING. AND

01:43:18.092 --> 01:43:19.960 region:rollup2
WORKING HERE IN CALIFORNIA FOR

01:43:19.226 --> 01:43:21.962 region:rollup2
YEARS.

01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:23.064 region:rollup2
FURTHERMORE.

01:43:21.962 --> 01:43:24.398 region:rollup2
WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE US

01:43:23.064 --> 01:43:25.466 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTION MAKE STATES

01:43:24.398 --> 01:43:25.1000 region:rollup2
DEPENDENT ON THE FEDERAL

01:43:25.466 --> 01:43:27.668 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT FOR IMMIGRATION

01:43:25.1000 --> 01:43:28.769 region:rollup2
POLICY.

01:43:27.668 --> 01:43:30.104 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THAT WE'VE REACHED

01:43:28.769 --> 01:43:32.039 region:rollup2
OUT TO THE MEMBERS OF CALIFORNIA

01:43:30.104 --> 01:43:34.075 region:rollup2
DELEGATION WHO AGREED THAT THE

01:43:32.039 --> 01:43:35.009 region:rollup2
ISSUE NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED

01:43:34.075 --> 01:43:36.944 region:rollup2
HOWEVER WHEN IT COMES TO

01:43:35.009 --> 01:43:37.478 region:rollup2
IMMIGRATION. THE REAL BIG

01:43:36.944 --> 01:43:39.213 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION HAPPENING IN

01:43:37.478 --> 01:43:40.581 region:rollup2
CONGRESS.

01:43:39.213 --> 01:43:42.216 region:rollup2
IS HAVING TO DEAL WITH BAKA AND

01:43:40.581 --> 01:43:43.751 region:rollup2
THE WALL.

01:43:42.216 --> 01:43:45.252 region:rollup2
THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO

01:43:43.751 --> 01:43:46.987 region:rollup2
GET THE ISSUE OF THE LABOR

01:43:45.252 --> 01:43:48.355 region:rollup2
SHORTAGES ON THEIR RADAR BECAUSE

01:43:46.987 --> 01:43:50.424 region:rollup2
OF THE SEVERE ECONOMIC

01:43:48.355 --> 01:43:52.526 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES THEY HAVE HAD AND

01:43:50.424 --> 01:43:53.828 region:rollup2
THAT SEEMS TO BE WORSENING.

01:43:52.526 --> 01:43:55.463 region:rollup2
THAT BEING SAID IT'S IMPORTANT

01:43:53.828 --> 01:43:57.531 region:rollup2
TO UNDERSTAND THE CALIFORNIA HAS

01:43:55.463 --> 01:43:59.600 region:rollup2
THE KEY AND TRIMMING ROLE IN HOW

01:43:57.531 --> 01:44:00.634 region:rollup2
THIS PROGRAM WILL BE OPERATED.

01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:01.702 region:rollup2
WHILE THE PROVISIONS WOULD NEED

01:44:00.634 --> 01:44:03.838 region:rollup2
TO BE NEGOTIATED WITH THE

01:44:01.702 --> 01:44:05.573 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY.

01:44:03.838 --> 01:44:07.308 region:rollup2
OUR BILL WILL BE GOING TO DHS

01:44:05.573 --> 01:44:08.342 region:rollup2
ONLY AFTER WE HAVE CRAFTED IT.

01:44:07.308 --> 01:44:08.876 region:rollup2
IN THE WAY THAT WE BELIEVE WOULD

01:44:08.342 --> 01:44:11.178 region:rollup2
BE THE MOST BENEFICIAL FOR

01:44:08.876 --> 01:44:12.580 region:rollup2
STATE.

01:44:11.178 --> 01:44:14.081 region:rollup2
IF WE DO NOT LIKE WHAT DHS COMES

01:44:12.580 --> 01:44:15.850 region:rollup2
BACK WITH.

01:44:14.081 --> 01:44:17.218 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR HAS THE COMPLETE

01:44:15.850 --> 01:44:18.252 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY TO REJECT THE VERSION

01:44:17.218 --> 01:44:20.020 region:rollup2
DHS PROPOSES.

01:44:18.252 --> 01:44:21.555 region:rollup2
LASTLY

01:44:20.020 --> 01:44:22.723 region:rollup2
THIS BILL DOES NOT UNDERMINE ANY

01:44:21.555 --> 01:44:23.524 region:rollup2
EFFORTS CONGRESS HAS MADE

01:44:22.723 --> 01:44:25.359 region:rollup2
REGARDING IMMIGRATION POLICY FOR

01:44:23.524 --> 01:44:26.594 region:rollup2
FARMWORKERS.

01:44:25.359 --> 01:44:28.195 region:rollup2
THERE IS A PROVISION IN OUR BILL

01:44:26.594 --> 01:44:29.797 region:rollup2
THAT SAYS ANY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:44:28.195 --> 01:44:31.499 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WOULD PREEMPT A STATE.

01:44:29.797 --> 01:44:32.333 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

01:44:31.499 --> 01:44:33.400 region:rollup2
WELL I DON'T AGREE WITH THE

01:44:32.333 --> 01:44:35.636 region:rollup2
CURRENT ADMINISTRATION'S STANCE

01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:36.537 region:rollup2
ON IMMIGRATION POLICY WE CAN ALL

01:44:35.636 --> 01:44:37.037 region:rollup2
AGREE THAT CALIFORNIA'S

INDUSTRIES.

01:44:38.839 --> 01:44:41.809 region:rollup2
ARE TOO VITAL TO THE STATE'S

01:44:39.807 --> 01:44:43.544 region:rollup2
ECONOMY TO DO NOTHING.

01:44:41.809 --> 01:44:44.445 region:rollup2
THE EDTA ESTIMATE THAT THERE ARE

01:44:43.544 --> 01:44:46.313 region:rollup2
OVER EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND FARM

01:44:44.445 --> 01:44:47.948 region:rollup2
WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA.

01:44:46.313 --> 01:44:49.016 region:rollup2
THE NATIONAL AGRICULTURE SURVEY

01:44:49.884 --> 01:44:52.920 region:rollup2
AUTHORIZED.

01:44:51.719 --> 01:44:54.455 region:rollup2
WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:55.256 region:rollup2
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

01:44:54.455 --> 01:44:57.224 region:rollup2
UNAUTHORIZED WORKERS ARE

01:44:55.256 --> 01:44:58.592 region:rollup2
DEPORTED.

01:44:57.224 --> 01:44:59.293 region:rollup2
BY SETTING THE GROUNDWORK FOR A

01:45:01.095 --> 01:45:04.064 region:rollup2
THAT IS WHY THAT THE AKAKA'S IT

THOUSANDS OF MEN AND WOMEN HAVE

01:45:07.101 --> 01:45:08.602 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTED TO THE ECONOMIC

01:45:07.668 --> 01:45:09.303 region:rollup2
STRENGTH OF CALIFORNIA'S

01:45:11.138 --> 01:45:14.008 region:rollup2
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ACKNOWLEDGE

01:45:12.706 --> 01:45:15.442 region:rollup2
OUR STATE ECONOMIC STANDING

01:45:14.008 --> 01:45:16.076 region:rollup2
WITHOUT HAVING HAD THE ACTIVE

INDIVIDUALS.

01:45:18.145 --> 01:45:20.881 region:rollup2
DESPITE THE WELL INTENTIONED AND

01:45:25.286 --> 01:45:28.355 region:rollup2
TIMES.

01:45:27.054 --> 01:45:29.824 region:rollup2
WE HAD MORE DEPORTATIONS IN THE

01:45:28.355 --> 01:45:31.158 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS NINE YEARS THAT WE HAVE

01:45:29.824 --> 01:45:31.959 region:rollup2
HAD AT ANY OTHER TIME SINCE

01:45:31.158 --> 01:45:33.561 region:rollup2
THEY'D HAVE BEEN KEPT ON THIS

01:45:31.959 --> 01:45:35.396 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

01:45:33.561 --> 01:45:36.130 region:rollup2

OR BEFORE THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM

01:46:02.122 --> 01:46:05.059 region:rollup2

WORKERS THAT ARE EFFICIENT

01:47:27.941 --> 01:47:30.945 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE AND HIGHLY SKILLED.

01:47:29.877 --> 01:47:32.079 region:rollup2
THE LABOR SHORTAGE WE HAVE

01:47:30.945 --> 01:47:33.480 region:rollup2

LEAVE PRODUCE IN THE FIELD. THIS

01:47:42.256 --> 01:47:45.326 region:rollup2
MEANS THAT THEY'VE GONE TO THE

01:47:43.457 --> 01:47:46.927 region:rollup2
TROUBLE OF PLANTING.

01:47:45.326 --> 01:47:49.430 region:rollup2

THE NECESSARY RESOURCES INTO IT

01:47:53.067 --> 01:47:55.836 region:rollup2
AND THEN LEAVE IT IN THE FALL

01:47:54.101 --> 01:47:57.137 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF A LABOR SHORTAGE.

01:47:55.836 --> 01:47:59.306 region:rollup2
THIS PUTS FARMERS AT RISK

01:47:57.137 --> 01:48:02.309 region:rollup2
ECONOMICALLY WASTING FOOD AND

01:47:59.306 --> 01:48:02.910 region:rollup2
RURAL. ECONOMIES AT RISK AS WELL

01:48:02.309 --> 01:48:04.244 region:rollup2
IN AND QUITE FRANKLY ON IT IT

01:48:02.910 --> 01:48:06.213 region:rollup2

01:48:04.244 --> 01:48:08.115 region:rollup2
.

01:48:06.213 --> 01:48:10.217 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT BECAUSE WITHOUT

01:48:08.115 --> 01:48:11.385 region:rollup2
WORKERS IN THAT IN THE ECONOMY

01:48:10.217 --> 01:48:13.087 region:rollup2
OUR LOCAL ECONOMY STARTS TO

01:48:11.385 --> 01:48:14.655 region:rollup2
SUFFER AS WELL.

01:48:13.087 --> 01:48:15.989 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY IMMIGRANT FAMILIES

01:48:14.655 --> 01:48:16.957 region:rollup2
ARE TERRIFIED THEY'RE WORRIED

01:48:15.989 --> 01:48:18.726 region:rollup2
ABOUT IMMIGRATION RATES AND

01:48:16.957 --> 01:48:21.662 region:rollup2
DEPORTATIONS.

01:48:18.726 --> 01:48:23.030 region:rollup2
I RECENTLY WENT TO A TOWN HALL

01:48:21.662 --> 01:48:24.965 region:rollup2
MEETING ON IMMIGRATION AND WAS

01:48:23.030 --> 01:48:26.700 region:rollup2
APPROACHED BY LITTLE GIRL. WHO

01:48:24.965 --> 01:48:28.302 region:rollup2
TELL ME IN TEARS AS SHE WAS

01:48:26.700 --> 01:48:30.037 region:rollup2
ABOUT EIGHT YEARS OLD THAT SHE

01:48:28.302 --> 01:48:30.704 region:rollup2
WAS TERRIFIED TO GO TO SCHOOL?

01:48:30.037 --> 01:48:32.406 region:rollup2
AND.

01:48:30.704 --> 01:48:33.707 region:rollup2
SHE WAS AFRAID THAT IF YOU WENT

01:48:32.406 --> 01:48:35.442 region:rollup2
TO SCHOOL.

01:48:33.707 --> 01:48:37.344 region:rollup2
SHE WOULD COME HOME AND FIND HER

01:48:35.442 --> 01:48:39.646 region:rollup2
PARENTS. GONE I'VE BEEN TOLD BY

01:48:37.344 --> 01:48:42.616 region:rollup2
SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS THAT.

01:48:39.646 --> 01:48:43.417 region:rollup2
WHEN THERE IS A LOCAL RATE IN

01:48:42.616 --> 01:48:45.085 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITY AND SOMEONE IS

01:48:43.417 --> 01:48:45.986 region:rollup2
DEPORTED THAT THE NUMBER OF

01:48:45.085 --> 01:48:47.621 region:rollup2
CHILDREN THAT SHOW FOR SCHOOL

01:48:45.986 --> 01:48:49.757 region:rollup2
DROP SIGNIFICANTLY. AND THAT

01:48:47.621 --> 01:48:51.592 region:rollup2
PARENTS DON'T SHOW UP FOR WORK

01:48:49.757 --> 01:48:53.761 region:rollup2
BECAUSE FOR A PERIOD OF TIME

01:48:51.592 --> 01:48:55.229 region:rollup2
THERE'S FEAR. THAT THE ICE

01:48:53.761 --> 01:48:57.064 region:rollup2
AGENTS ARE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD

01:48:55.229 --> 01:48:58.532 region:rollup2
AND PEOPLE WON'T GO OUT AND DO

01:48:57.064 --> 01:49:00.134 region:rollup2
THEIR DAY TO DAY ACTIVITIES THIS

01:48:58.532 --> 01:49:01.168 region:rollup2
IS HAVING A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON

01:49:00.134 --> 01:49:02.369 region:rollup2
OUR SCHOOLS AND IT'S HAVING A

01:49:01.168 --> 01:49:04.271 region:rollup2
TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON OUR WORK

WORKFORCE AS WELL. IT'S CREATED

01:49:04.271 --> 01:49:08.742 region:rollup2
IN OUT UNHEALTHY ATMOSPHERE OF

01:49:06.073 --> 01:49:10.511 region:rollup2
ENGLISH FEAR AND SUSPICION THAT

01:49:08.742 --> 01:49:12.046 region:rollup2
HURTS FAMILIES EMOTIONALLY AND

01:49:10.511 --> 01:49:13.981 region:rollup2
ECONOMICALLY AND FRANKLY THERE'S

01:49:12.046 --> 01:49:15.315 region:rollup2
THIS SENSE IN THE COMMUNITY BUT

01:49:13.981 --> 01:49:16.884 region:rollup2
NO ONE'S DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT

01:49:15.315 --> 01:49:17.718 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S REALLY THE REASON.

01:49:16.884 --> 01:49:20.320 region:rollup2
WHY?

01:49:17.718 --> 01:49:22.322 region:rollup2
WHEN I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO

IN BERKELEY.

01:51:09.496 --> 01:51:13.634 region:rollup2
WAS PUBLISHED.

01:51:10.831 --> 01:51:15.402 region:rollup2
OF OVER FIVE HUNDRED AND

01:51:13.634 --> 01:51:16.503 region:rollup2
SEVENTY WOMEN FARMWORKERS OF

01:51:15.402 --> 01:51:18.939 region:rollup2
THAT WAR AT.

01:51:16.503 --> 01:51:20.107 region:rollup2
CLINIC HAS INVTED SALINAS THAT

01:51:18.939 --> 01:51:21.375 region:rollup2
CONFIRMED THAT THEIR FEAR

01:51:20.107 --> 01:51:23.377 region:rollup2
DEPORTATION.

01:51:21.375 --> 01:51:26.446 region:rollup2
WAS CAUSING A SIGNIFICANT.

01:51:23.377 --> 01:51:27.981 region:rollup2
AT RISK OF FOUR HEART ATTACKS

01:51:26.446 --> 01:51:29.316 region:rollup2
AND SO THIS WAS CHRONICLED IN

01:51:27.981 --> 01:51:31.051 region:rollup2
THIS RESEARCH IS ACTUALLY

01:51:29.316 --> 01:51:32.152 region:rollup2
PUBLISHED IN IN ONE OF THE.

01:51:31.051 --> 01:51:34.421 region:rollup2
MEDICAL JOURNALS.

01:51:32.152 --> 01:51:35.923 region:rollup2
SO.

01:51:34.421 --> 01:51:36.690 region:rollup2
I WANTED TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS

01:51:35.923 --> 01:51:39.026 region:rollup2
THAT I UNDERSTOOD.

01:51:36.690 --> 01:51:40.527 region:rollup2
SERVER SEVERAL MEMBERS ON THIS

01:51:39.026 --> 01:51:42.763 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE HAVE.

01:51:40.527 --> 01:51:43.997 region:rollup2
VISAS FOR THESE WORKERS ARE

01:51:42.763 --> 01:51:45.766 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY WORKING IN CALIFORNIA

01:51:43.997 --> 01:51:46.934 region:rollup2
WHO AVERAGE OVER TWELVE YEARS OF

01:51:45.766 --> 01:51:48.835 region:rollup2
HAVING LIVED IN CALIFORNIA AND

01:51:46.934 --> 01:51:49.870 region:rollup2
HAVING WORKED IN THE FIELDS.

01:51:48.835 --> 01:51:51.338 region:rollup2
THERE ARE NO VISAS FOR THIS

01:51:49.870 --> 01:51:52.706 region:rollup2
POPULATION.

01:51:51.338 --> 01:51:54.274 region:rollup2
IT IS NOT JUST A FEDERAL

01:51:52.706 --> 01:51:55.642 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

01:51:54.274 --> 01:51:56.643 region:rollup2
AND THAT WAS A CONCERN THAT I

01:51:55.642 --> 01:51:58.545 region:rollup2
BELIEVE MISS MELENDEZ.

01:51:56.643 --> 01:52:00.380 region:rollup2
RAISED AT SOME TIME.

01:51:58.545 --> 01:52:01.882 region:rollup2
THIS IS A PROBLEM OF THE

01:52:00.380 --> 01:52:04.785 region:rollup2
ECONOMY.

01:52:01.882 --> 01:52:06.220 region:rollup2
THERE ARE MAJOR ANALYSIS THAT

01:52:04.785 --> 01:52:07.554 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN DONE OF THE LABOR

01:52:06.220 --> 01:52:08.722 region:rollup2
SHORTAGES IN THE UNITED STATES

01:52:07.554 --> 01:52:11.291 region:rollup2
OF AMERICA.

01:52:08.722 --> 01:52:12.492 region:rollup2
AND TO DO AWAY WITH WORKERS WHO

01:52:11.291 --> 01:52:14.227 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN WORKING AND

01:52:12.492 --> 01:52:15.996 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTING SIGNIFICANTLY. TO

01:52:14.227 --> 01:52:17.497 region:rollup2
THE NECK ECONOMIC WELL BEING OF

01:52:15.996 --> 01:52:19.066 region:rollup2
THIS STATE. AYE IS AN ABSOLUTE

01:52:17.497 --> 01:52:21.034 region:rollup2
SHAME.

01:52:19.066 --> 01:52:23.437 region:rollup2
THIS BILL DOES NOT.

01:52:21.034 --> 01:52:25.405 region:rollup2
SUPERSEDE FEDERAL LAW. WE DID

01:52:23.437 --> 01:52:26.707 region:rollup2
THIS BILL AND TWO THOUSAND

01:52:25.405 --> 01:52:29.443 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN I WENT BACK TO

01:52:26.707 --> 01:52:30.711 region:rollup2
WASHINGTON I MET ALONG WITH

01:52:29.443 --> 01:52:31.878 region:rollup2
MISTER MIND RIGHT BETTIS WAS THE

01:52:30.711 --> 01:52:33.847 region:rollup2
MEMBER FROM COACHELLA AT THE

01:52:31.878 --> 01:52:35.716 region:rollup2
TIME. WE MET WITH THE DEPUTY

01:52:33.847 --> 01:52:37.117 region:rollup2
DIRECTOR FOR PLANNING AND

01:52:35.716 --> 01:52:39.086 region:rollup2
EVALUATION AT THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:52:37.117 --> 01:52:40.754 region:rollup2
HOMELAND SECURITY THEY LIKE THIS

01:52:39.086 --> 01:52:42.522 region:rollup2
BILL THEY THOUGHT THIS BILL MADE

01:52:40.754 --> 01:52:44.091 region:rollup2
SENSE. AND OF THE BILL HAD

01:52:42.522 --> 01:52:46.293 region:rollup2
PASSED IN THAT EYELASH.

01:52:44.091 --> 01:52:47.394 region:rollup2
SESSION OF THE LEGISLATURE THEY

01:52:46.293 --> 01:52:49.796 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE CONSIDERED.

01:52:47.394 --> 01:52:50.897 region:rollup2
THE PACKAGE THAT WE WOULD HAVE

01:52:49.796 --> 01:52:52.666 region:rollup2
DELIVER TO.

01:52:50.897 --> 01:52:54.134 region:rollup2
THIS BILL IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

01:52:52.666 --> 01:52:56.370 region:rollup2
THIS BILL CALLS FOR DOING

01:52:54.134 --> 01:52:56.903 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT IS NOT BEING DONE

01:52:56.370 --> 01:52:59.006 region:rollup2
AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL OR

01:52:56.903 --> 01:53:00.173 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED. I HAVE A STUDY HERE

01:52:59.006 --> 01:53:01.441 region:rollup2
FOR THE MEMBERS OF THE

01:53:00.173 --> 01:53:02.542 region:rollup2
REPUBLICAN PARTY.

01:53:01.441 --> 01:53:04.044 region:rollup2
FROM THE.

01:53:02.542 --> 01:53:05.646 region:rollup2
SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:53:04.044 --> 01:53:07.848 region:rollup2
AGRICULTURE.

01:53:05.646 --> 01:53:08.482 region:rollup2
WHEN JUST TRYING TO RESPOND TO

01:53:07.848 --> 01:53:09.483 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE

01:53:08.482 --> 01:53:12.052 region:rollup2
RAISED.

01:53:09.483 --> 01:53:13.987 region:rollup2
AND IN THIS STUDY THEY SIMPLY

01:53:12.052 --> 01:53:16.089 region:rollup2
INDICATE THAT THE WAY TO DEAL

01:53:13.987 --> 01:53:18.191 region:rollup2
WITH THE LABOR SHORTAGES THAT.

01:53:16.089 --> 01:53:20.627 region:rollup2
OUR EXISTING AND IS THE NUMBER

01:53:18.191 --> 01:53:22.296 region:rollup2
ONE ISSUE FOR ALL OF AGRICULTURE

01:53:20.627 --> 01:53:23.964 region:rollup2
IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

01:53:22.296 --> 01:53:25.465 region:rollup2
ACCORDING TO MR SONNY PERDUE.

01:53:23.964 --> 01:53:26.566 region:rollup2
THE ONLY ISSUE THEY DESCRIBE

01:53:25.465 --> 01:53:28.302 region:rollup2
THAT WILL SOLVE THAT PROBLEM IS

01:53:26.566 --> 01:53:30.704 region:rollup2
THE AGE TO A PROGRAM.

01:53:28.302 --> 01:53:32.039 region:rollup2
ON BEHALF OF GROWERS THAT I

01:53:30.704 --> 01:53:33.940 region:rollup2
CAN'T SPEAK ON BEHALF OF BUT

01:53:32.039 --> 01:53:34.608 region:rollup2
KNOWING THEM AND HEARING THEM

01:53:33.940 --> 01:53:36.710 region:rollup2
AND HAVING MET WITH HIM ON THIS

01:53:34.608 --> 01:53:38.245 region:rollup2
ISSUE. NONE OF THEM REALLY LIKE

01:53:36.710 --> 01:53:39.980 region:rollup2
THE AGE TO A PROGRAM.

01:53:38.245 --> 01:53:41.315 region:rollup2
IN FACT VERY FEW PEOPLE LIKE THE

01:53:39.980 --> 01:53:43.483 region:rollup2
H. TWO A PROGRAM FOR A NUMBER OF

01:53:41.315 --> 01:53:44.651 region:rollup2
REASONS AND ALL OF THE MAJOR AG

01:53:43.483 --> 01:53:45.986 region:rollup2
GROUPS HAVE INDICATED VERY

01:53:44.651 --> 01:53:48.121 region:rollup2
CLEARLY THAT THEY OPPOSE THE

01:53:45.986 --> 01:53:49.856 region:rollup2
GOODS THAT BILL WHICH WAS IS D.

01:53:48.121 --> 01:53:51.224 region:rollup2
H. TO SEE PROGRAM. WHICH IS

01:53:49.856 --> 01:53:53.160 region:rollup2
SIMPLY AN EXPEDITED VERSION OF

01:53:51.224 --> 01:53:54.328 region:rollup2
H. TO A WHICH IS NOT RESPONSIVE

01:53:53.160 --> 01:53:55.595 region:rollup2
TO THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA

01:53:54.328 --> 01:53:56.863 region:rollup2
AGRICULTURE.

01:53:55.595 --> 01:53:58.198 region:rollup2
SO LET'S LOOK AT THE OTHER

01:53:56.863 --> 01:53:59.533 region:rollup2
CONCERN THAT HAS BEEN RAISED

01:53:58.198 --> 01:54:01.568 region:rollup2
THAT WE WOULD BE NEGOTIATING

01:53:59.533 --> 01:54:03.837 region:rollup2
WITH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.

01:54:01.568 --> 01:54:04.271 region:rollup2
THE GROUPS INCLUDING THE UFW AND

01:54:03.837 --> 01:54:05.739 region:rollup2
OTHERS WHO HAVE BEEN

01:54:04.271 --> 01:54:07.474 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATING.

01:54:05.739 --> 01:54:09.476 region:rollup2
IN CONGRESS

01:54:07.474 --> 01:54:10.010 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATING NOT WOULD

01:54:09.476 --> 01:54:10.777 region:rollup2
SIMPLY THE MEMBERS OF THE

01:54:10.010 --> 01:54:11.411 region:rollup2
SENATE.

01:54:10.777 --> 01:54:13.046 region:rollup2
THEY'VE BEEN NEGOTIATING WITH

01:54:11.411 --> 01:54:14.314 region:rollup2
THE MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE

01:54:13.046 --> 01:54:14.748 region:rollup2
THE MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE ARE

01:54:14.314 --> 01:54:16.683 region:rollup2
CARRIED FORWARD THIS

01:54:14.748 --> 01:54:18.452 region:rollup2
PRESIDENT'S.

01:54:16.683 --> 01:54:19.586 region:rollup2
IMMIGRATION AGENDA.

01:54:18.452 --> 01:54:20.153 region:rollup2
SO IN ESSENCE THEY ARE

01:54:19.586 --> 01:54:22.289 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATING WITH THE TRUMP

01:54:20.153 --> 01:54:23.190 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION.

01:54:22.289 --> 01:54:24.858 region:rollup2
THE DIFFERENCE WITH THIS BILL S.

01:54:23.190 --> 01:54:26.793 region:rollup2
MISTER.

01:54:24.858 --> 01:54:28.662 region:rollup2
GARCIA HAS VERY WELL POINTED OUT

01:54:26.793 --> 01:54:30.097 region:rollup2
IS WE WILL DEVELOP THE PLAN THAT

01:54:28.662 --> 01:54:31.898 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE MAKES THE MOST SENSE

01:54:30.097 --> 01:54:33.867 region:rollup2
FOR THE GROWERS DE INDUSTRY. AND

01:54:31.898 --> 01:54:35.402 region:rollup2
THE WORKERS.

01:54:33.867 --> 01:54:35.969 region:rollup2
IF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND

01:54:35.402 --> 01:54:37.204 region:rollup2
SECURITY COMES BACK WITH THE

01:54:35.969 --> 01:54:38.905 region:rollup2
VERSION.

01:54:37.204 --> 01:54:40.340 region:rollup2
THAT WE BELIEVE IS NOT IN THE

01:54:38.905 --> 01:54:42.442 region:rollup2
BEST INTEREST OF THOSE THREE

01:54:40.340 --> 01:54:43.310 region:rollup2
PRIMARY CONCERNS.

01:54:42.442 --> 01:54:45.178 region:rollup2
THEN THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE

01:54:43.310 --> 01:54:47.347 region:rollup2
HAS. COMPLETE AUTHORITY UNDER

01:54:45.178 --> 01:54:50.016 region:rollup2
THIS LAW TO SAY NO.

01:54:47.347 --> 01:54:50.550 region:rollup2
THAT IS NOT THE OPPORTUNITY THAT

01:54:50.016 --> 01:54:52.285 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE WHEN YOU LOOK AT

01:54:50.550 --> 01:54:53.520 region:rollup2
FEDERAL LAW.

01:54:52.285 --> 01:54:55.589 region:rollup2
THAT IS NOT THE OPPORTUNITY YOU

01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:57.691 region:rollup2
HAVE TO TO MAKE A DEAL ANDHAKA

01:54:55.589 --> 01:54:59.059 region:rollup2
AND THE WALL.

01:54:57.691 --> 01:55:00.894 region:rollup2
THE DEAL IS THAT BOUGHT THAT

01:54:59.059 --> 01:55:02.295 region:rollup2
BILL PASSES AND WHATEVER THE

01:55:00.894 --> 01:55:03.663 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES ARE AND THE

01:55:02.295 --> 01:55:05.766 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT LAW OR

01:55:03.663 --> 01:55:07.567 region:rollup2
THERE IS THE LAW.

01:55:05.766 --> 01:55:09.403 region:rollup2
THIS BILL GIVES US A CHANCE TO

01:55:07.567 --> 01:55:11.605 region:rollup2
DO SOMETHING VERY UNIQUE.

01:55:09.403 --> 01:55:13.940 region:rollup2
IT'S ABLE TO PUT A THE ISSUE OF

01:55:11.605 --> 01:55:15.675 region:rollup2
LABOR SHORTAGES IN THE CONTEXT

01:55:13.940 --> 01:55:17.477 region:rollup2
IT SHOULD BE VIEWED WHICH IS.

01:55:15.675 --> 01:55:19.079 region:rollup2
AND ECONOMIC PROBLEM.

01:55:17.477 --> 01:55:21.214 region:rollup2
AND ECONOMIC PROBLEM THAT YOU S.

01:55:19.079 --> 01:55:22.916 region:rollup2
WORKERS WILL NOT RESOLVE IN THE

01:55:21.214 --> 01:55:24.251 region:rollup2
YEARS TO COME. SO WE HOPE THAT

01:55:22.916 --> 01:55:25.952 region:rollup2
THIS COMMITTEE WOULD REALLY LOOK

01:55:24.251 --> 01:55:27.554 region:rollup2
AT THE MERITS OF WHAT OF WHAT

01:55:25.952 --> 01:55:29.322 region:rollup2
WE'VE ATTEMPTED TO DO.

01:55:27.554 --> 01:55:31.291 region:rollup2
WE THINK THE BILL IS A SOLID

01:55:29.322 --> 01:55:32.692 region:rollup2
BILL IT'S VERY PRACTICAL IT HAS

01:55:31.291 --> 01:55:34.394 region:rollup2
SUPPORT FROM REPUBLICANS AND

01:55:32.692 --> 01:55:35.395 region:rollup2
FROM DEMOCRATS AND IT HAS

01:55:34.394 --> 01:55:36.830 region:rollup2
SUPPORT FROM GROWERS AND THE

01:55:35.395 --> 01:55:37.731 region:rollup2
WORKER COMMUNITY.

01:55:36.830 --> 01:55:39.633 region:rollup2
WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL REALLY

01:55:37.731 --> 01:55:40.434 region:rollup2
GIVE THOROUGH CONSIDERATION TO

01:55:39.633 --> 01:55:42.068 region:rollup2
APPROVING THIS BILL THANK YOU

I THINK YOU DO YOU HAVE OTHER

01:55:42.936 --> 01:55:55.015 region:rollup2
WITNESSES ONE POSSIBLY.

GOING BACK PROBABLY MORE THAN

01:56:27.681 --> 01:56:30.951 region:rollup2
EIGHTY YEARS WHEN MY ANCESTORS

01:56:29.182 --> 01:56:33.119 region:rollup2

IS ABOUT OUR PEOPLE AND NOW AND

01:58:18.124 --> 01:58:22.028 region:rollup2
THEN ARE HARSH. CHALLENGES WITH

LABOR.

01:58:22.028 --> 01:58:25.298 region:rollup2
NOW WE HAVE HAD.

01:58:23.730 --> 01:58:27.267 region:rollup2
SHORTAGES OF LABOR. OFTEN ON FOR

01:58:25.298 --> 01:58:29.536 region:rollup2
THE LAST.

01:58:27.267 --> 01:58:31.271 region:rollup2
TEN YEARS AND IF IT GETS A

01:58:29.536 --> 01:58:32.839 region:rollup2
LITTLE PROGRESSIVELY WORSE.

01:58:31.271 --> 01:58:34.908 region:rollup2
I WOULD SAY PROBABLY THE LAST

01:58:32.839 --> 01:58:36.543 region:rollup2
TIME WE DIDN'T HAVE A LABOR

01:58:34.908 --> 01:58:38.478 region:rollup2
SHORTAGE WAS PROBABLY.

01:58:36.543 --> 01:58:39.646 region:rollup2
FOUR FOUR OR SO YEARS AGO WHEN

01:58:38.478 --> 01:58:40.780 region:rollup2
WE WERE AT THE HEIGHT OF THE

01:58:39.646 --> 01:58:42.716 region:rollup2
DROUGHT AND WE COULDN'T PLAY AT

01:58:40.780 --> 01:58:44.217 region:rollup2
ALL OF OUR CROPS.

01:58:42.716 --> 01:58:46.152 region:rollup2
THAT YEAR WE HAD PROBABLY A

01:58:44.217 --> 01:58:48.021 region:rollup2
THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY PERCENT OF

01:58:46.152 --> 01:58:49.089 region:rollup2
OUR FORM FELLOW. SO WE DIDN'T

01:58:48.021 --> 01:58:51.358 region:rollup2
HAVE JOBS.

01:58:49.089 --> 01:58:52.993 region:rollup2
THAT WE NORMALLY WOULD HAVE.

01:58:51.358 --> 01:58:54.928 region:rollup2
AND AND THAT THAT HURTS US

01:58:52.993 --> 01:58:57.464 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE ARE SOME OF OUR

01:58:54.928 --> 01:58:59.599 region:rollup2
PEOPLE DIDN'T DIDN'T HAVE WORK

01:58:57.464 --> 01:59:02.402 region:rollup2
THAT HERE. BUT TODAY WE HAVE

01:58:59.599 --> 01:59:04.671 region:rollup2
WATER AND WE HAVE A LOT OF BILLS

01:59:02.402 --> 01:59:05.839 region:rollup2
PLANTED AND WE WE CAN HOPE TO

01:59:04.671 --> 01:59:07.474 region:rollup2
HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO PICK THOSE

01:59:05.839 --> 01:59:09.642 region:rollup2
CROPS.

01:59:07.474 --> 01:59:11.511 region:rollup2
MELONS ARE VERY PERISHABLE AND

01:59:09.642 --> 01:59:13.079 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE TO PICK UP THE THE VERY

01:59:11.511 --> 01:59:14.848 region:rollup2
DAY THAT THEY'RE. THAT THEY'RE

01:59:13.079 --> 01:59:17.017 region:rollup2
RIPE IF YOU'RE NOT THERE THE

01:59:14.848 --> 01:59:18.551 region:rollup2
NEXT DAY THEY'RE OVERRIPE AND

01:59:17.017 --> 01:59:19.919 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE TO THROW THEM AWAY.

01:59:18.551 --> 01:59:22.122 region:rollup2
AND AND IT'S A IT'S A VERY

01:59:19.919 --> 01:59:24.024 region:rollup2
CHALLENGING JOB WE WORK SEVEN

01:59:22.122 --> 01:59:25.258 region:rollup2
DAYS A WEEK. WE STARTED SIGN UP

01:59:24.024 --> 01:59:27.527 region:rollup2
AND WE WORK UNTIL WE FINISH THE

01:59:25.258 --> 01:59:29.362 region:rollup2
FIELD. DOESN'T TAKE IT DOESN'T

01:59:27.527 --> 01:59:31.331 region:rollup2
MATTER HOW LONG IT TAKES.

01:59:29.362 --> 01:59:32.365 region:rollup2
NOW IF WE'RE SHORT OF PEOPLE IT

01:59:31.331 --> 01:59:33.833 region:rollup2
TAKES US LONGER TO COVER THE

01:59:32.365 --> 01:59:35.368 region:rollup2
FIELD AND SOMETIMES WE DON'T

01:59:33.833 --> 01:59:35.935 region:rollup2
MAKE IT TO THE END OF THE FIELD

01:59:35.368 --> 01:59:36.803 region:rollup2
AND WE LOSE SOME OF THE CROP

01:59:35.935 --> 01:59:38.571 region:rollup2
THAT'S.

01:59:36.803 --> 01:59:40.740 region:rollup2
AT THE OTHER END.

01:59:38.571 --> 01:59:42.542 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S BUT IS VERY CHALLENGING

01:59:40.740 --> 01:59:45.178 region:rollup2
BECAUSE EVERY YEAR WERE WE SEEM

01:59:42.542 --> 01:59:46.546 region:rollup2
TO BE A LITTLE SHORT OF PEOPLE

01:59:45.178 --> 01:59:48.681 region:rollup2
AND IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR

01:59:46.546 --> 01:59:50.817 region:rollup2
WORKERS TO BECAUSE. OUR CREWS

01:59:48.681 --> 01:59:52.919 region:rollup2
ARE ARE MILLING CREWS ARE TWENTY

01:59:50.817 --> 01:59:54.921 region:rollup2
PEOPLE BEACH HAVE A DEFINED JOB

01:59:52.919 --> 01:59:56.656 region:rollup2
AND WHEN THERE'S. SOMETIMES A

01:59:54.921 --> 01:59:57.857 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF PEOPLE SHORT.

01:59:56.656 --> 01:59:59.859 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY ELSE HAS TO FILL IN FOR

01:59:57.857 --> 02:00:01.494 region:rollup2
THEM AND IT IT IT IT DOES CREATE

01:59:59.859 --> 02:00:03.196 region:rollup2
MORE WORK FOR. ARE UP FOR THE

02:00:01.494 --> 02:00:05.298 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT WE DO HAVE.

02:00:03.196 --> 02:00:06.232 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO DO WHAT

02:00:05.298 --> 02:00:08.268 region:rollup2
WE CAN TO HAVE.

02:00:06.232 --> 02:00:11.371 region:rollup2
.

02:00:08.268 --> 02:00:14.007 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT MORE SECURE LABOR.

02:00:11.371 --> 02:00:16.109 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER

02:00:14.007 --> 02:00:17.577 region:rollup2
COMPANIES IN IN OUR CENTRAL

02:00:16.109 --> 02:00:18.645 region:rollup2
VALLEY AND GET CALIFORNIA.

02:00:17.577 --> 02:00:20.647 region:rollup2
THAT GROW.

02:00:18.645 --> 02:00:22.282 region:rollup2
PERISHABLE VEGETABLES AND

02:00:20.647 --> 02:00:24.084 region:rollup2
FRUITS THAT ALSO HAVE A LOT OF

02:00:22.282 --> 02:00:26.586 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES.

02:00:24.084 --> 02:00:28.555 region:rollup2
AND ONE THING ABOUT CALIFORNIA

02:00:26.586 --> 02:00:30.323 region:rollup2
THAT ó I'M ALWAYS PROUD TO

02:00:28.555 --> 02:00:32.058 region:rollup2
TELL PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE

02:00:30.323 --> 02:00:33.159 region:rollup2
WORLD TO COME HERE. IS THAT WE

02:00:32.058 --> 02:00:34.427 region:rollup2
HAVE THIS THIS WONDERFUL

02:00:33.159 --> 02:00:35.662 region:rollup2
MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE THAT WE

02:00:34.427 --> 02:00:36.563 region:rollup2
CAN GROW ALL THESE FRESH FRUITS

02:00:35.662 --> 02:00:38.164 region:rollup2
AND VEGETABLES THAT EVERYBODY

02:00:36.563 --> 02:00:39.766 region:rollup2
WANTS.

02:00:38.164 --> 02:00:41.301 region:rollup2
YOU GO TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE

02:00:39.766 --> 02:00:43.236 region:rollup2

FRUITS AND VEGETABLES.

02:00:43.236 --> 02:00:47.574 region:rollup2
AND SO THE COUNTRY DEPENDS ON

02:00:44.871 --> 02:00:49.609 region:rollup2
WHAT WE DO HERE AND AND AND WHAT

02:00:47.574 --> 02:00:50.944 region:rollup2
WE WHAT WE GROW HERE DEPENDS ON

02:00:49.609 --> 02:00:52.912 region:rollup2
HAND LEVER.

02:00:50.944 --> 02:00:56.249 region:rollup2
WE ARE NOT ANYTIME SOON GOING TO

02:00:52.912 --> 02:00:59.319 region:rollup2

02:00:56.249 --> 02:01:00.520 region:rollup2
GRAPE PICKING. OR. YOU KNOW A

02:00:59.319 --> 02:01:02.255 region:rollup2
LOT OF THESE OTHER CROPS THAT

HAVE TO BE PICKED CHERRIES LIKE

02:01:02.255 --> 02:01:04.457 region:rollup2
LIKE WE GROW. CAN DO A BY

02:01:03.890 --> 02:01:06.559 region:rollup2
MACHINE WE HAVE TO DO IT BY

02:01:04.457 --> 02:01:08.294 region:rollup2
HAND.

02:01:06.559 --> 02:01:10.730 region:rollup2
AND HAVE SO WHERE IT WOULD WE

02:01:08.294 --> 02:01:11.564 region:rollup2
NEED TO HAVE A DEPENDABLE OF

02:01:10.730 --> 02:01:13.700 region:rollup2
LABOR SO.

02:01:11.564 --> 02:01:15.168 region:rollup2
SUPPLY SO THAT WE CAN GET THESE

02:01:13.700 --> 02:01:17.270 region:rollup2
THINGS DONE.

02:01:15.168 --> 02:01:19.072 region:rollup2
IF WE DON'T OF IT ISN'T JUST THE

02:01:17.270 --> 02:01:20.540 region:rollup2
FARMS GOING TO HURT IT'S ALSO

02:01:19.072 --> 02:01:21.107 region:rollup2
THE COUNTRY THAT'S GONNA HURT

02:01:20.540 --> 02:01:22.242 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE WON'T BE ABLE TO

02:01:21.107 --> 02:01:24.043 region:rollup2
PICK.

02:01:22.242 --> 02:01:25.578 region:rollup2
THOSE HEALTHY FRUITS THAT

02:01:24.043 --> 02:01:27.780 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY DEPENDS ON THAT BEYOND

02:01:25.578 --> 02:01:29.315 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA FOR.

02:01:27.780 --> 02:01:31.851 region:rollup2
AND SO I WOULD KNOW WOULD

ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONSIDER THIS

02:01:31.851 --> 02:01:34.654 region:rollup2
BILL.

02:01:32.552 --> 02:01:36.089 region:rollup2
VERY SERIOUSLY BECAUSE I I

02:01:34.654 --> 02:01:38.291 region:rollup2
THINK THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT

02:01:36.089 --> 02:01:38.992 region:rollup2

AND OUR OUR OUR OUR PEOPLE ARE

02:01:45.565 --> 02:01:49.235 region:rollup2
HARD WORKING PEOPLE AND WE TAKE

THAT. AND.

02:01:50.170 --> 02:01:55.408 region:rollup2
AND AND SO THERE ARE THEY'RE

02:01:53.239 --> 02:01:58.044 region:rollup2
GETTING OLDER HARP OUR WORKFORCE

02:01:55.408 --> 02:02:00.079 region:rollup2
IS AGING. WE SEE THAT THERE'S

02:01:58.044 --> 02:02:00.680 region:rollup2
NOT A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE COMING

02:02:00.079 --> 02:02:03.550 region:rollup2
IN.

02:02:00.680 --> 02:02:05.985 region:rollup2
ARE FARMWORKERS CHILDREN.

02:02:03.550 --> 02:02:07.620 region:rollup2
ARE NOT COMING BACK TO THE FARM.

02:02:05.985 --> 02:02:08.188 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GOING OFF TO COLLEGE AND

02:02:07.620 --> 02:02:10.356 region:rollup2
WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THAT WE

WE DO AND.

02:02:11.491 --> 02:02:17.230 region:rollup2
SO THERE IS A A A GAP THAT'S

02:02:14.427 --> 02:02:18.898 region:rollup2
BEING LEFT BEHIND BY OUR

02:02:17.230 --> 02:02:21.801 region:rollup2
FARMWORKERS WHEN SOME OF THEM

VARIOUS DISTRICTS TO TALK HERE

02:09:42.141 --> 02:09:45.111 region:rollup2

02:09:42.842 --> 02:09:45.811 region:rollup2
MISTER THURMOND I JUST WANTED TO

DONE.

02:09:49.649 --> 02:09:53.085 region:rollup2
WAS NOT WORKING. AND THAT'S WHY

02:09:52.518 --> 02:09:53.986 region:rollup2
THE MEMBER HAD A BILL BEFORE

02:09:53.085 --> 02:09:55.321 region:rollup2

02:09:56.455 --> 02:09:59.425 region:rollup2
COMMENT WAS VERY APPROPRIATE.

02:09:58.224 --> 02:10:01.193 region:rollup2
WHAT HAS BEEN ATTEMPTED?

02:09:59.425 --> 02:10:03.963 region:rollup2
FOR THE LAST.

02:10:01.193 --> 02:10:04.997 region:rollup2

EXCITER. HAS NOT WORKED.

02:10:13.205 --> 02:10:16.575 region:rollup2
WE HAVE LESS PEOPLE BECAUSE OF

02:10:14.674 --> 02:10:17.843 region:rollup2
DEPORTATIONS UNDER A DEMOCRATIC

02:10:16.575 --> 02:10:19.278 region:rollup2
PRESIDENT AND WE HAVE A

02:10:17.843 --> 02:10:21.180 region:rollup2
PHENOMENAL FEAR FACTOR BY

REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATION.

02:10:21.180 --> 02:10:24.950 region:rollup2
SO WHAT HAS BEEN GOING ON HAS

02:10:22.848 --> 02:10:26.585 region:rollup2
NOT WORKED.

02:10:36.128 --> 02:10:40.099 region:rollup2
CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILL.

02:10:38.397 --> 02:10:41.467 region:rollup2
I TESTIFIED OVER A HUNDRED TIMES

02:10:40.099 --> 02:10:42.835 region:rollup2
ON THE IMMIGRATION BILL IN

02:10:41.467 --> 02:10:44.503 region:rollup2
CONGRESS THAT CONGRESS PASSED IN

02:10:42.835 --> 02:10:46.238 region:rollup2

02:10:44.503 --> 02:10:48.341 region:rollup2
HUNDRED TIMES ON BOTH THE SENATE

02:10:46.238 --> 02:10:48.908 region:rollup2
AND ON THE HOUSE SIDE ON EVERY

02:10:48.341 --> 02:10:49.775 region:rollup2
ASPECT OF THE BILL THAT WAS

02:10:48.908 --> 02:10:51.177 region:rollup2
PASSED

02:10:49.775 --> 02:10:52.578 region:rollup2

02:11:02.088 --> 02:11:06.292 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED

02:11:04.356 --> 02:11:07.827 region:rollup2
THE BEST POSSIBLE BILL WITH THE

02:11:06.292 --> 02:11:09.195 region:rollup2

02:11:09.195 --> 02:11:13.099 region:rollup2
GOING TO WANT. WE WON'T KNOW

02:11:11.163 --> 02:11:15.401 region:rollup2

EVERYTHING THAT THEY HAVE. THAT

02:31:55.907 --> 02:31:59.811 region:rollup2
THAT WE ARE USING THEM AS LABOR

02:31:57.875 --> 02:32:01.279 region:rollup2
ONLY IN NOT PROVIDING THE HOPE

02:31:59.811 --> 02:32:03.147 region:rollup2
FOR THE AMERICAN DREAM THAT THEY

02:32:01.279 --> 02:32:05.383 region:rollup2
CAME HERE FOR IN THAT THEY

02:32:03.147 --> 02:32:06.918 region:rollup2
SACRIFICE THEIR BODIES FOR SO

02:32:05.383 --> 02:32:09.721 region:rollup2

DISCUSSION I HOPE WE. WITHOUT

02:33:01.139 --> 02:33:03.775 region:rollup2
THE BILL CAN CONTINUE TO COME UP

02:33:02.507 --> 02:33:04.776 region:rollup2
WITH SOMETHING MAYBE SO WE COULD

02:33:03.775 --> 02:33:06.010 region:rollup2

SO THAT SHOWS HOW MUCH POWER WE

02:35:52.877 --> 02:35:55.513 region:rollup2
HAVE AND DON'T HAVE.

02:35:54.679 --> 02:35:57.114 region:rollup2
THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT WE

02:35:55.513 --> 02:35:58.783 region:rollup2
DON'T WE CAN DO TO PROTECT OUR

02:35:57.114 --> 02:35:59.884 region:rollup2

THINGS WE CAN'T DO.

02:36:02.220 --> 02:36:06.324 region:rollup2
AND SO. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT.

02:36:03.988 --> 02:36:07.925 region:rollup2
.

02:36:06.324 --> 02:36:09.227 region:rollup2
IT AND AND ONE I KNOW ONE OF THE

02:36:07.925 --> 02:36:10.795 region:rollup2
BETWEEN AUTHORS ALSO ROOMS OR

02:36:09.227 --> 02:36:12.496 region:rollup2
FOR DEBT. KIND OF FEAR BEING

02:36:10.795 --> 02:36:13.064 region:rollup2
INSTALLED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE

02:36:12.496 --> 02:36:13.864 region:rollup2
AISLE AND I JUST THINK THAT

02:36:13.064 --> 02:36:15.666 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:36:13.864 --> 02:36:17.168 region:rollup2
IT IS NOT A REALITY WE TALK

02:36:15.666 --> 02:36:18.603 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT FEAR

02:36:17.168 --> 02:36:20.471 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU ACTION HAVE MEMBERS

02:36:18.603 --> 02:36:23.074 region:rollup2
YOUR COMMUNITY THAT HAVE BEEN

02:36:20.471 --> 02:36:23.641 region:rollup2
DETAINED AND DEPORTED. BY ISIS

02:36:23.074 --> 02:36:25.910 region:rollup2
VERSES.

02:36:23.641 --> 02:36:27.478 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW AND THE REALITY OF

02:36:25.910 --> 02:36:29.213 region:rollup2
THAT HAPPENING. AND THEN THE

02:36:27.478 --> 02:36:30.681 region:rollup2
FEAR THAT'S IS STILL BECAUSE OF

02:36:29.213 --> 02:36:32.216 region:rollup2
NOT JUST RHETORIC BUT ACTIONS

02:36:30.681 --> 02:36:33.618 region:rollup2
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE AND FROM

02:36:32.216 --> 02:36:36.787 region:rollup2
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.

02:36:33.618 --> 02:36:38.155 region:rollup2
THAT ARE DIVIDING OF SO WHO

02:36:36.787 --> 02:36:39.390 region:rollup2
CREATING ALLEGE OUR COMMUNITY

02:36:38.155 --> 02:36:40.691 region:rollup2
THAT'S THAT'S.

02:36:39.390 --> 02:36:41.959 region:rollup2
CREATING INTENTIONAL FEAR IN

02:36:40.691 --> 02:36:44.495 region:rollup2
OUR COMMUNITY.

02:36:41.959 --> 02:36:45.596 region:rollup2
IT'S A MUCH DIFFERENT THING AND

02:36:44.495 --> 02:36:47.431 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO BE REALISTIC

02:36:45.596 --> 02:36:48.833 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY HAVE MAJOR EMPLOYERS

02:36:47.431 --> 02:36:50.468 region:rollup2
THE HEART OF OUR ECONOMY. WHICH

02:36:48.833 --> 02:36:51.302 region:rollup2
IS THE FARMERS IN THE WORKERS

02:36:50.468 --> 02:36:54.038 region:rollup2
THAT WORK ON THOSE FARMS.

02:36:51.302 --> 02:36:55.339 region:rollup2
AND YET.

02:36:54.038 --> 02:36:57.108 region:rollup2
THAT ECONOMY IS NOT HOLDING THE

02:36:55.339 --> 02:36:59.043 region:rollup2
WHITE HOUSE ACCOUNTABLE.

02:36:57.108 --> 02:37:00.311 region:rollup2
GOT HOLDING THAT THE CONGRESS

02:36:59.043 --> 02:37:03.014 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE

02:37:00.311 --> 02:37:04.315 region:rollup2
THEY'RE THE ONES THAT REALLY.

02:37:03.014 --> 02:37:06.083 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE PROTECTING THIS

02:37:04.315 --> 02:37:07.685 region:rollup2
ECONOMY.

02:37:06.083 --> 02:37:08.686 region:rollup2
SO SHOULD WE AS CALIFORNIANS DO

02:37:07.685 --> 02:37:10.154 region:rollup2
WILL BE CAN TO PROTECT US

02:37:08.686 --> 02:37:11.722 region:rollup2
ECONOMY AND PROTECT AGRICULTURAL

02:37:10.154 --> 02:37:13.090 region:rollup2
WORKERS ABSOLUTELY IN FACT I

02:37:11.722 --> 02:37:15.359 region:rollup2
THINK THIS LEGISLATURE HAS ON

ALSO.

02:46:23.207 --> 02:46:25.709 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IS OFTEN ON THE

02:46:24.074 --> 02:46:26.743 region:rollup2
VANGUARD ON THE FRONT LINES ON

02:46:25.709 --> 02:46:28.445 region:rollup2
THE CUTTING EDGE DOING THINGS

02:46:26.743 --> 02:46:29.646 region:rollup2
FIRST WERE NOT HERE THERE ARE

02:46:28.445 --> 02:46:31.515 region:rollup2
TWELVE STATES THAT ALREADY HAVE

02:46:29.646 --> 02:46:32.382 region:rollup2
THIS LAW.

02:46:31.515 --> 02:46:34.751 region:rollup2
I IN THOSE STATES.

02:46:32.382 --> 02:46:36.220 region:rollup2
WE HAVEN'T HEARD A CLAMORING

02:46:34.751 --> 02:46:38.355 region:rollup2
FROM EMPLOYERS WE HAVEN'T HEARD

02:46:36.220 --> 02:46:40.023 region:rollup2
FROM ANY PARTICULAR. A TRAITOR

02:46:38.355 --> 02:46:40.991 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY THAT THAT THE SKY HAS

02:46:40.023 --> 02:46:42.459 region:rollup2

LONGER WORK.

02:46:42.459 --> 02:46:45.629 region:rollup2
I'M OF COURSE THERE ARE SOME

02:46:43.660 --> 02:46:46.263 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCES IN STATE LAW AYE BUT

02:46:45.629 --> 02:46:47.431 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT IF IT CAN WORKING

02:46:46.263 --> 02:46:48.298 region:rollup2
TWELVE OTHER STATES GIVEN ALL

02:46:47.431 --> 02:46:49.399 region:rollup2

IT WORK

02:46:51.535 --> 02:46:56.440 region:rollup2
HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

02:46:54.605 --> 02:46:59.476 region:rollup2
MANY WORKERS FIND THAT THAT

02:46:56.440 --> 02:47:00.944 region:rollup2
CANNABIS CAN BE. A.

02:46:59.476 --> 02:47:03.013 region:rollup2
ARE EXCELLENT ALTERNATIVE TO

02:47:00.944 --> 02:47:04.281 region:rollup2
OTHER DRUGS THAT HAVE A VERY

02:47:03.013 --> 02:47:04.681 region:rollup2
DEBILITATING SIDE EFFECTS SUCH

02:47:04.281 --> 02:47:06.750 region:rollup2
AS.

02:47:04.681 --> 02:47:08.118 region:rollup2
ADDICTIVE OPIOIDS ROLLO EVER

02:47:06.750 --> 02:47:10.554 region:rollup2

02:47:08.118 --> 02:47:11.955 region:rollup2
AND A LOT OF STUDIES HAVE SHOWN

02:47:10.554 --> 02:47:13.790 region:rollup2
EQUIPMENT CLEAN ONE FROM DR

02:47:15.259 --> 02:47:19.196 region:rollup2
CANNABIS CAN BE A REAL

02:47:16.627 --> 02:47:20.531 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE AT TWO TWO ADDICTIVE

02:47:19.196 --> 02:47:22.966 region:rollup2
OPIOIDS.

02:47:20.531 --> 02:47:25.002 region:rollup2

INTERACTIVE PROCESS BEING GAUGED

02:48:05.642 --> 02:48:07.411 region:rollup2
IN WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY A

02:48:06.810 --> 02:48:08.946 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION BETWEEN EMPLOYER

EVEN PRESENTED A CONFERENCES

02:51:39.489 --> 02:51:42.192 region:rollup2
INVOLVING A DRUG TESTING IN THE

CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY SON I'M

02:51:42.192 --> 02:51:44.528 region:rollup2
VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE DRUG

02:51:43.827 --> 02:51:45.095 region:rollup2
TESTING IN THE CONSTRUCTION

02:51:44.528 --> 02:51:47.097 region:rollup2

CASES INVOLVING DRUG TESTING.

02:51:52.068 --> 02:51:57.274 region:rollup2
SO I JUST WANT TO TRY TO

02:51:54.271 --> 02:51:59.342 region:rollup2
DISENTANGLE A LITTLE BIT. V. A

02:51:57.274 --> 02:52:01.545 region:rollup2
DRUG FREE WORKPLACE POLICIES

02:51:59.342 --> 02:52:02.412 region:rollup2
FROM REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION.

02:52:01.545 --> 02:52:03.013 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT.

02:52:02.412 --> 02:52:05.715 region:rollup2
THEM.

02:52:03.013 --> 02:52:07.017 region:rollup2
SO.

02:52:05.715 --> 02:52:08.084 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS HAVE BEEN HAD DRUG

02:52:07.017 --> 02:52:09.519 region:rollup2
FREE WORKPLACE POLICY SINCE AT

02:52:08.084 --> 02:52:10.053 region:rollup2
LEAST NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT AND

02:52:09.519 --> 02:52:11.154 region:rollup2
THEY'VE BEEN DEALING WITH.

02:52:10.053 --> 02:52:13.023 region:rollup2
.

02:52:11.154 --> 02:52:13.590 region:rollup2
ACCOMMODATIONS SINCE THE EIGHTY

02:52:13.023 --> 02:52:15.158 region:rollup2
EIGHT WAS PASSED IN NINETEEN

02:52:13.590 --> 02:52:16.293 region:rollup2
NINETY.

02:52:15.158 --> 02:52:17.194 region:rollup2
AND SO THEY WOULD BE BASICALLY

02:52:16.293 --> 02:52:19.396 region:rollup2
FOLLOWING THE EXACT SAME

02:52:17.194 --> 02:52:21.064 region:rollup2
POLICIES AND UPDATE THAT THEY

02:52:19.396 --> 02:52:22.199 region:rollup2
USE TO ACCOMMODATE.

02:52:21.064 --> 02:52:23.900 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE PRESCRIPTION

02:52:22.199 --> 02:52:25.068 region:rollup2

02:52:23.900 --> 02:52:26.369 region:rollup2
MEDICAL CANNABIS EXACT SAME

02:52:25.068 --> 02:52:28.205 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

02:52:26.369 --> 02:52:29.573 region:rollup2
AND SO CURRENTLY IF AN EMPLOYER

02:52:28.205 --> 02:52:31.408 region:rollup2
HAS A DRUG FREE POLICY IT

02:52:29.573 --> 02:52:32.909 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY STATES THAT THE

02:52:31.408 --> 02:52:34.277 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEE HAS TO INFORM THE

02:52:32.909 --> 02:52:35.445 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER.

02:52:34.277 --> 02:52:37.047 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY FOR THE DANGERS

02:52:35.445 --> 02:52:38.748 region:rollup2
OPERATION THAT THEY MAY BE

02:52:37.047 --> 02:52:40.750 region:rollup2
TAKING MEDICATION THAT MAY

02:52:38.748 --> 02:52:41.885 region:rollup2
IMPAIR THEIR ABILITY TO WORK.

02:52:40.750 --> 02:52:42.152 region:rollup2
AND.

02:52:41.885 --> 02:52:43.753 region:rollup2
AND THEN.

02:52:42.152 --> 02:52:46.156 region:rollup2
.

02:52:43.753 --> 02:52:47.991 region:rollup2
BUT IF THE EMPLOYEE IS SUBJECT

02:52:46.156 --> 02:52:49.860 region:rollup2
TO DRUG TESTING. AND DOESN'T

02:52:47.991 --> 02:52:51.494 region:rollup2
INFORM THE EMPLOYER THEN CASE

02:52:49.860 --> 02:52:52.629 region:rollup2
LAW HOLDS VERY CLEARLY THAT THE

02:52:51.494 --> 02:52:53.663 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER CAN TERMINATE THE

02:52:52.629 --> 02:52:55.232 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEE BECAUSE THE EMPLOYEE

02:52:53.663 --> 02:52:56.533 region:rollup2
NEVER MENTIONED IT TO THE AMP TO

03:04:32.128 --> 03:04:35.965 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE SAFETY BECAUSE OF ONE

03:04:33.629 --> 03:04:38.534 region:rollup2
IS IMPAIRED I'D END OF THE DAY.

03:04:35.965 --> 03:04:39.402 region:rollup2
DOTS THAT TAKES PRECEDENCE THAT

03:04:38.534 --> 03:04:41.737 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW YOU SHOULD NEVER ALLOW

03:04:39.402 --> 03:04:43.306 region:rollup2
SOMEONE TO PUT ANYONE ELSE CLEAN

03:04:41.737 --> 03:04:45.408 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES IN DANGER.

03:04:43.306 --> 03:04:46.876 region:rollup2
I AND SO YOU KNOW THAT THE

03:04:45.408 --> 03:04:48.144 region:rollup2
REALITY IS THAT.

03:04:46.876 --> 03:04:49.245 region:rollup2
BICU GIVEN THE FACT THERE'S

03:04:48.144 --> 03:04:50.846 region:rollup2
AN ACCEPTABLE LEGAL PRESCRIPTION

03:04:49.245 --> 03:04:53.449 region:rollup2
DRUGS THERE'S PLENTY OF FOLKS.

03:04:50.846 --> 03:04:55.051 region:rollup2
THAT USE CANNABIS OFFER

03:04:53.449 --> 03:04:55.785 region:rollup2
MEDICINAL PURPOSES FROM THE YOU

03:04:55.051 --> 03:04:57.420 region:rollup2
KNOW THE HAVE LOW LEVELS OF

03:04:55.785 --> 03:04:58.888 region:rollup2
TEENAGE SCENE THEY BENEFIT FROM

03:04:57.420 --> 03:05:00.990 region:rollup2
A HIGHER LEVEL OF CBD.

03:04:58.888 --> 03:05:03.526 region:rollup2
THERE ARE. WELL KNOWN.

03:05:00.990 --> 03:05:05.428 region:rollup2
AND SCIENTIFICALLY SHOWN

03:05:03.526 --> 03:05:06.462 region:rollup2
MEDICINAL BENEFITS SO AT THE END

03:05:05.428 --> 03:05:08.898 region:rollup2
OF THE DAY IF WE HAVE AN

03:05:06.462 --> 03:05:09.498 region:rollup2
EXCEPTION FOR LEGAL PRESCRIPTION

03:05:08.898 --> 03:05:11.334 region:rollup2
DRUGS THAT THE EMPLOYERS HAVE

03:05:09.498 --> 03:05:13.269 region:rollup2
BEEN ABLE. TO ACCOMMODATE TWO

03:05:11.334 --> 03:05:15.738 region:rollup2
EIGHTY A THERE'S NO REASON WHY

03:05:13.269 --> 03:05:17.106 region:rollup2
WE CAN'T DO THE SAME FOR

03:05:15.738 --> 03:05:19.241 region:rollup2
CANNABIS THE QUESTION.

03:05:17.106 --> 03:05:20.910 region:rollup2
THAT THIS COMES DOWN TO IS DOUG

03:05:19.241 --> 03:05:22.945 region:rollup2
DO YOU BELIEVE OR DOES VALUE

03:05:20.910 --> 03:05:23.512 region:rollup2
BELIEVE DOES CANNABIS PROVIDE

03:05:22.945 --> 03:05:24.914 region:rollup2
LEGITIMATE MODESTO MEDICINAL

03:05:23.512 --> 03:05:26.248 region:rollup2
BENEFITS.

03:05:24.914 --> 03:05:27.483 region:rollup2
SCIENTIFICALLY IT SHOWS THAT IS

03:05:26.248 --> 03:05:29.518 region:rollup2
SHOWN THAT IT DOES NOT A MATTER

03:05:27.483 --> 03:05:30.686 region:rollup2
OF BELIEF. EVEN IF YOU DON'T

03:05:29.518 --> 03:05:32.154 region:rollup2
BELIEVE IT DOES IF YOU'RE STILL

03:05:30.686 --> 03:05:33.622 region:rollup2
THINKING BACK ON THE REEFER

03:05:32.154 --> 03:05:34.390 region:rollup2
MADNESS DAYS.

03:05:33.622 --> 03:05:37.259 region:rollup2
THAT'S YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE THAT

03:05:34.390 --> 03:05:39.895 region:rollup2
OPINION. BUT THE REALITY IS THAT

03:05:37.259 --> 03:05:40.863 region:rollup2
CANNABIS DOES PROVIDE MEDICINAL

03:05:39.895 --> 03:05:42.765 region:rollup2
BENEFITS AND THAT THAT'S THE

03:05:40.863 --> 03:05:44.900 region:rollup2
CASE THERE SHOULD BE AN

03:05:42.765 --> 03:05:46.302 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY FOR ONE THAT HAS.

03:05:44.900 --> 03:05:48.037 region:rollup2
CANNABIS THROUGH BEFORE

03:05:46.302 --> 03:05:50.039 region:rollup2
MEDICINAL PURPOSES TO HAVE THE

03:05:48.037 --> 03:05:51.774 region:rollup2
SAME RIGHTS THAT SOMEONE THAT

03:05:50.039 --> 03:05:53.743 region:rollup2
HAS PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND

03:05:51.774 --> 03:05:55.344 region:rollup2
PAINKILLERS AND ABOUT A THOUSAND

03:05:53.743 --> 03:05:57.279 region:rollup2
OTHER TYPES OF PRESCRIPTION.

03:05:55.344 --> 03:05:58.514 region:rollup2
DRUG REMEDIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY

03:05:57.279 --> 03:05:59.982 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE.

03:05:58.514 --> 03:06:01.650 region:rollup2
AND THAT THE BALL THE SAME STEPS

03:05:59.982 --> 03:06:04.987 region:rollup2
ON THE SAME PROCESS HE'S THAT

03:06:01.650 --> 03:06:06.622 region:rollup2
DOES WORKERS DO AS WELL.

03:06:04.987 --> 03:06:08.157 region:rollup2
I AND SO OUT OF FOR THOSE

03:06:06.622 --> 03:06:09.225 region:rollup2
REASONS ON MY SUPPORT THE BILL I

03:06:08.157 --> 03:06:11.093 region:rollup2
DO THINK THAT THERE'S STILL AN

03:06:09.225 --> 03:06:12.061 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY THAT I KNOW. KNOWING

03:06:11.093 --> 03:06:13.796 region:rollup2
THE AUTHOR I KNOW THAT THERE

03:06:12.061 --> 03:06:14.530 region:rollup2
STILL WILL BE WORK DONE ON SOME

03:06:13.796 --> 03:06:16.165 region:rollup2
OF THE DETAILS OF HOW WE CAN

03:06:14.530 --> 03:06:18.467 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT THOSE WORKPLACE

03:06:16.165 --> 03:06:19.001 region:rollup2
SAFETY ISSUES ARE RECONCILED TO

03:06:18.467 --> 03:06:21.103 region:rollup2
A TO THE GREATEST EXTENT

03:06:19.001 --> 03:06:23.873 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE. BECAUSE AGAIN.

03:06:21.103 --> 03:06:25.241 region:rollup2
THE REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS

03:06:23.873 --> 03:06:27.009 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT FOR THAT THAT WOULD THAT

03:06:25.241 --> 03:06:28.744 region:rollup2
THAT SAFETY IS NEVER COMPROMISED

03:06:27.009 --> 03:06:31.080 region:rollup2
AND SO I CERTAINLY LOOK FORWARD.

03:06:28.744 --> 03:06:31.280 region:rollup2
BUT I'M CERTAINLY GOING TO VOTE

03:06:31.080 --> 03:06:33.582 region:rollup2
AYE.

03:06:31.280 --> 03:06:34.150 region:rollup2
TODAY IN AND HELPED MOVE THE

03:06:33.582 --> 03:06:35.651 region:rollup2
BILL RIGHT NOW.

03:06:34.150 --> 03:06:37.386 region:rollup2
IF THERE'S A SECOND.

03:06:35.651 --> 03:06:38.688 region:rollup2
AND AND WHEN I LOOK FORWARD TO

03:06:37.386 --> 03:06:40.456 region:rollup2
CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

03:06:38.688 --> 03:06:42.058 region:rollup2
AUTHOR AS WELL AS THOSE IN

03:06:40.456 --> 03:06:42.658 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION THAT WAS IT WAS. GOOD

03:06:42.058 --> 03:06:44.360 region:rollup2
TO HEAR THAT THERE WERE SOME

03:06:42.658 --> 03:06:44.960 region:rollup2
POSITIVE FEEDBACK FROM

03:06:44.360 --> 03:06:47.530 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION ON THE WORK THAT'S

03:06:44.960 --> 03:06:49.231 region:rollup2
ALREADY BEEN DONE.

03:06:47.530 --> 03:06:49.999 region:rollup2
A SIMILAR GONZALEZ FLETCHER

03:06:49.231 --> 03:06:52.568 region:rollup2
FOLLOWED BY SOME MOMENTUM

03:06:49.999 --> 03:06:55.738 region:rollup2
MCCARTY.

03:06:52.568 --> 03:06:56.338 region:rollup2
SO IS HELPFUL TO OUR LOOK. ASK

03:06:55.738 --> 03:06:58.240 region:rollup2
SOME QUESTIONS OF THE BUILDING

03:06:56.338 --> 03:06:59.341 region:rollup2
TRADES AT.

03:06:58.240 --> 03:07:00.643 region:rollup2
I DON'T SEE THEM HERE.

03:06:59.341 --> 03:07:03.112 region:rollup2
.

03:07:00.643 --> 03:07:05.347 region:rollup2
SO.

03:07:03.112 --> 03:07:06.849 region:rollup2
I WAS ON THE FENCE I ACTUALLY

03:07:05.347 --> 03:07:09.085 region:rollup2
AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT WAS

03:07:06.849 --> 03:07:10.886 region:rollup2
SAID TODAY BOTH ON BOTH SIDES

03:07:09.085 --> 03:07:13.689 region:rollup2
WHICH MAKES IT REALLY HARD I

03:07:10.886 --> 03:07:15.024 region:rollup2
MEAN THIS IS. IT'S LIKE I GET IT

03:07:13.689 --> 03:07:16.759 region:rollup2
WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT

03:07:15.024 --> 03:07:18.127 region:rollup2
THIS BUT THE SAFETY ISSUES IN

03:07:16.759 --> 03:07:19.328 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR SAFETY ISSUES IN THE

03:07:18.127 --> 03:07:20.496 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION TRADES THE

03:07:19.328 --> 03:07:22.865 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL'S SOME OF OUR.

03:07:20.496 --> 03:07:24.233 region:rollup2
.

03:07:22.865 --> 03:07:25.801 region:rollup2
WHO ARE SENSITIVE WORK PLACES

03:07:24.233 --> 03:07:27.937 region:rollup2
FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS?

03:07:25.801 --> 03:07:30.573 region:rollup2
MAKE THIS COMPLICATED SO I HAD

03:07:27.937 --> 03:07:32.374 region:rollup2
SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW.

03:07:30.573 --> 03:07:34.543 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ARE NOW USED

03:07:32.374 --> 03:07:36.579 region:rollup2
AND WHETHER THAT NOTICE IS GIVEN

03:07:34.543 --> 03:07:38.948 region:rollup2
AT THE HIRING HALLS OR IS IT IT

03:07:36.579 --> 03:07:40.583 region:rollup2
NOT IN A. IN A WORKERS NOT

03:07:38.948 --> 03:07:41.183 region:rollup2
DISPATCHED TO A JOB SITE OR

03:07:40.583 --> 03:07:42.218 region:rollup2
GIVEN TO THE EMPLOYEE I DON'T

03:07:41.183 --> 03:07:43.853 region:rollup2
KNOW IF.

03:07:42.218 --> 03:07:46.956 region:rollup2
IF YOU COULD ANSWER THAT OF IF

03:07:43.853 --> 03:07:48.691 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY COULD ANSWER THAT.

03:07:46.956 --> 03:07:49.959 region:rollup2
SOME OF OUR GONZALEZ FLETCHER.

03:07:48.691 --> 03:07:51.127 region:rollup2
WE ARE ON THE LETTER NOW

03:07:49.959 --> 03:07:52.828 region:rollup2
POSITION WITH THE BUILDING

03:07:51.127 --> 03:07:53.996 region:rollup2
TRADES IN OUR MY MEMBERS ARE

03:07:52.828 --> 03:07:55.364 region:rollup2
SIGNATORY THE CARPENTERS AND

03:07:53.996 --> 03:07:57.266 region:rollup2
LABOR'S AGREEMENTS.

03:07:55.364 --> 03:07:59.001 region:rollup2
THE WAY. I READ THIS COLLECTIVE

03:07:57.266 --> 03:08:00.803 region:rollup2
BARGAINING AGREEMENTS AS THE

03:07:59.001 --> 03:08:02.171 region:rollup2
ATTORNEY SAID. WORKERS AND

03:08:00.803 --> 03:08:03.939 region:rollup2
PROSPECTIVE WORKERS TO THOSE

03:08:02.171 --> 03:08:05.508 region:rollup2
FROM A HIRING HALL ARE OBLIGATED

03:08:03.939 --> 03:08:08.277 region:rollup2
TO TELL THE EMPLOYER IF THEY

03:08:05.508 --> 03:08:10.346 region:rollup2
WANT PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS TODAY.

03:08:08.277 --> 03:08:11.881 region:rollup2
I AS HE SAID FAILURE TO TELL

03:08:10.346 --> 03:08:12.615 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER WOULD RESULT IN

03:08:11.881 --> 03:08:15.251 region:rollup2
TERMINATION.

03:08:12.615 --> 03:08:16.719 region:rollup2
IF A WORKER FROM THE HALL IS

03:08:15.251 --> 03:08:18.754 region:rollup2
TELLS US WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO

03:08:16.719 --> 03:08:20.055 region:rollup2
RETURN THEM TO THE HIRING HALL.

03:08:18.754 --> 03:08:22.291 region:rollup2
WE ALSO HAVE THE RIGHT AT THE

03:08:20.055 --> 03:08:23.859 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS SOLE DISCRETION NOT TO

03:08:22.291 --> 03:08:25.261 region:rollup2
DISPATCH THE WORKER AND AS A

03:08:23.859 --> 03:08:26.529 region:rollup2
PRACTICAL MATTER IF A WORKER

03:08:25.261 --> 03:08:28.097 region:rollup2
TELLS US THEY AREN'T OPIOIDS

03:08:26.529 --> 03:08:29.865 region:rollup2
THEY WILL NOT BE DISPATCHED TO

03:08:28.097 --> 03:08:31.467 region:rollup2
THE JOB SITE TODAY. IF THAT

03:08:29.865 --> 03:08:33.068 region:rollup2
WORKER LATER DOESN'T TELL US

03:08:31.467 --> 03:08:34.603 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY THEY ARE TERMINATED IF

03:08:33.068 --> 03:08:36.172 region:rollup2
THEY TASK HIGHER THAN THE

03:08:34.603 --> 03:08:37.306 region:rollup2
PERMISSIBLE LEVELS THEY ARE

03:08:36.172 --> 03:08:38.774 region:rollup2
TERMINATED.

03:08:37.306 --> 03:08:41.043 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S HOW THAT PROCESS WORKS

03:08:38.774 --> 03:08:43.612 region:rollup2
TODAY OUR COLLECTIVE ARGUMENTS

03:08:41.043 --> 03:08:45.414 region:rollup2
ALSO SPEAK TO MARIJUANA.

03:08:43.612 --> 03:08:47.183 region:rollup2
AND SAY ARE YOU KNOW EXIT

03:08:45.414 --> 03:08:48.484 region:rollup2
TERMINATING OFFENSE THERE ARE

03:08:47.183 --> 03:08:50.719 region:rollup2
ALSO A NUMBER OF STATE LAWS

03:08:48.484 --> 03:08:52.755 region:rollup2
CALTRANS FOR EXAMPLE. IN THE

03:08:50.719 --> 03:08:54.824 region:rollup2
STATE HAS ITS OWN DRUG WE FREE

03:08:52.755 --> 03:08:57.159 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE RULE AS IT APPLIES TO

03:08:54.824 --> 03:08:58.627 region:rollup2
CONTRACTS WHICH WOULD RESULT IN

03:08:57.159 --> 03:09:01.230 region:rollup2
CESSATION OF THE PROJECT.

03:08:58.627 --> 03:09:02.431 region:rollup2
SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS BILL

03:09:01.230 --> 03:09:04.500 region:rollup2
THERE ARE OTHER ELEMENTS THAT

03:09:02.431 --> 03:09:05.601 region:rollup2
HAVE TO BE FACTORED IN WE WILL

03:09:04.500 --> 03:09:07.903 region:rollup2
BE OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH

03:09:05.601 --> 03:09:09.705 region:rollup2
STATE CONTRACTS.

03:09:07.903 --> 03:09:10.806 region:rollup2
IF A WORKERS TEST POSITIVE

03:09:09.705 --> 03:09:12.274 region:rollup2
ALSO WE HAVE THE HIGHEST WORK

03:09:10.806 --> 03:09:14.677 region:rollup2
COMP RATES OF ANY INDUSTRY ONE

03:09:12.274 --> 03:09:16.946 region:rollup2
IN FIVE. FATALITIES A CURRENT

03:09:14.677 --> 03:09:18.447 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION ON SO IT IS A

03:09:16.946 --> 03:09:20.282 region:rollup2
UNIQUE

03:09:18.447 --> 03:09:21.851 region:rollup2
SETTING. AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE

03:09:20.282 --> 03:09:22.818 region:rollup2
ASKED FOR AN EXEMPTION IN THIS

03:09:21.851 --> 03:09:24.854 region:rollup2
ARENA.

03:09:22.818 --> 03:09:25.955 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE DO WE DO HAVE A ZERO

03:09:24.854 --> 03:09:27.656 region:rollup2
TOLERANCE POLICY TODAY FOR

03:09:25.955 --> 03:09:29.258 region:rollup2
OPIOIDS.

03:09:27.656 --> 03:09:30.492 region:rollup2
YET I THINK WHAT MY DISCUSSIONS

03:09:29.258 --> 03:09:32.027 region:rollup2
WITH THE AUTHOR EARLIER I'M

03:09:30.492 --> 03:09:33.929 region:rollup2
GRATEFUL FOR THAT ZERO TOLERANCE

03:09:32.027 --> 03:09:35.231 region:rollup2
POLICY OF HAVING WORKED WITH A

03:09:33.929 --> 03:09:37.366 region:rollup2
LOT OF WORKERS I'M ALSO GRATEFUL

03:09:35.231 --> 03:09:39.068 region:rollup2
THAT YOU NOW AT. THE SAME HIRING

03:09:37.366 --> 03:09:41.537 region:rollup2
HALLS IN THE SAME UNIONS HIGHER.

03:09:39.068 --> 03:09:43.739 region:rollup2
.

03:09:41.537 --> 03:09:44.807 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE A BROAD AND.

03:09:43.739 --> 03:09:46.008 region:rollup2
ARRAY OF FOLKS THEY'RE WILLING

03:09:44.807 --> 03:09:47.476 region:rollup2
TO HIGHER IN A LOT OF THE

03:09:46.008 --> 03:09:49.445 region:rollup2
POLICIES WE PUT FORWARD IN THIS.

03:09:47.476 --> 03:09:51.347 region:rollup2
IN IN THIS HOUSE TO SAY YOU

03:09:49.445 --> 03:09:53.749 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE IN NOW LOOK PAST

03:09:51.347 --> 03:09:55.017 region:rollup2
PEOPLE'S PAST ADAM.

03:09:53.749 --> 03:09:57.386 region:rollup2
INDISCRETIONS.

03:09:55.017 --> 03:09:58.854 region:rollup2
ARE ARE ARE. DONE WITH JOY IN

03:09:57.386 --> 03:10:00.956 region:rollup2
THE BUILDING TRADES AND A LOT OF

03:09:58.854 --> 03:10:01.724 region:rollup2
THINGS EXCUSE BUT I'M THERE'S A

03:10:00.956 --> 03:10:03.058 region:rollup2
NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE WORKERS.

03:10:01.724 --> 03:10:04.360 region:rollup2
.

03:10:21.543 --> 03:10:26.482 region:rollup2
THE DRUG FREE.

03:10:24.179 --> 03:10:27.483 region:rollup2

MARIJUANA MAY BE OUTDATED.

03:11:08.057 --> 03:11:13.262 region:rollup2
INSIDE I THINK I WAS GIVING

03:11:10.426 --> 03:11:13.796 region:rollup2
REALLY BAD EXAMPLES OF LAKE SO

03:11:13.262 --> 03:11:16.231 region:rollup2

THAT WITH THE CHANGE IN THE LAW

03:11:25.808 --> 03:11:28.844 region:rollup2
THAT'S CHANGED.

03:11:26.442 --> 03:11:30.579 region:rollup2
IS THAT CORRECT.

03:11:28.844 --> 03:11:33.115 region:rollup2
YES WE WE ADDRESSED.

03:11:30.579 --> 03:11:34.416 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE OF.

03:11:33.115 --> 03:11:36.018 region:rollup2
GETTING A ADOPTED RECOMMENDATION

03:11:34.416 --> 03:11:36.518 region:rollup2
TO BE LICENSED PHYSICIAN AND YOU

03:11:36.018 --> 03:11:37.419 region:rollup2
HAVE TO BE AN ATTENDING

03:11:36.518 --> 03:11:38.721 region:rollup2
PHYSICIAN

03:11:37.419 --> 03:11:40.122 region:rollup2
WHICH MEANS THAT YOU'VE DONE AND

03:11:38.721 --> 03:11:41.724 region:rollup2
EXAMINATION OF THE PATIENT

03:11:40.122 --> 03:11:42.958 region:rollup2
BEFORE YOU'VE GIVEN THEM THE

03:11:41.724 --> 03:11:44.760 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION FOR FOR MEDI.

03:11:42.958 --> 03:11:45.961 region:rollup2
CANADA SO WE THINK WITH THE

03:11:44.760 --> 03:11:47.229 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT FOR THE LICENSING

03:11:45.961 --> 03:11:48.597 region:rollup2
WITH THE REQUIREMENT TO BE AN

ATTENDING PHYSICIAN.

03:11:48.597 --> 03:11:52.401 region:rollup2
FRANKLY WITH WITH.

03:11:50.666 --> 03:11:53.268 region:rollup2
WITH ADULT USE THERE'S LESS.

03:11:52.401 --> 03:11:55.571 region:rollup2
SEEKING OUT OF MEDICAL.

03:11:53.268 --> 03:11:56.438 region:rollup2
.

03:11:55.571 --> 03:11:58.574 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT EVIL ANY OF

03:11:56.438 --> 03:11:59.775 region:rollup2
THAT WORK.

03:11:58.574 --> 03:12:01.810 region:rollup2
WHAT'S THAT UNTIL PEOPLE MONEY

03:11:59.775 --> 03:12:02.478 region:rollup2
IS AT WORK POSSIBLY AM IF IF

03:12:01.810 --> 03:12:03.712 region:rollup2
THEY'RE IN A BUT THAT RELIGION

03:12:02.478 --> 03:12:06.248 region:rollup2
OF PATIENTS WITH A DETERMINED

03:12:03.712 --> 03:12:06.782 region:rollup2
MEDICAL CONDITION AND EMPLOYER

03:12:06.248 --> 03:12:09.618 region:rollup2
CAN ASK FOR PROOF OF THAT

03:12:06.782 --> 03:12:12.087 region:rollup2
MEDICAL CONDITION.

03:12:09.618 --> 03:12:13.756 region:rollup2
HOW OFTEN DOES A PATIENT HAVE TO

03:12:12.087 --> 03:12:16.792 region:rollup2
RENEW?

03:12:13.756 --> 03:12:18.894 region:rollup2
THAT PRESCRIPTION.

03:12:16.792 --> 03:12:20.195 region:rollup2
BUT IS IT UNLIMITED I I I'M JUST

03:12:18.894 --> 03:12:22.131 region:rollup2
DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THIS OR I'M

03:12:20.195 --> 03:12:22.664 region:rollup2
SORRY I KNOW THIS IS.

03:12:22.131 --> 03:12:24.066 region:rollup2
IT ARE CORRECT ANSWER THE

03:12:22.664 --> 03:12:24.967 region:rollup2
QUESTION SHORT SWORD EMPLOYEE

03:12:24.066 --> 03:12:26.335 region:rollup2
SEEKING PROTECTIONS UNDER THIS

03:12:24.967 --> 03:12:27.236 region:rollup2
BILL WOULD HAVE TO PRESENT TO

03:12:26.335 --> 03:12:29.304 region:rollup2
THE EMPLOYER THAT THEY'RE

03:12:27.236 --> 03:12:29.772 region:rollup2
SEEKING ACCOMMODATION AND THEN

03:12:29.304 --> 03:12:30.906 region:rollup2
THERE'S A JOINT THEIR

03:12:29.772 --> 03:12:31.807 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION.

03:12:30.906 --> 03:12:32.908 region:rollup2
AND.

03:12:31.807 --> 03:12:35.377 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHETHER THAT.

03:12:32.908 --> 03:12:36.178 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTION IS GOOD ENOUGH IS

03:12:35.377 --> 03:12:37.413 region:rollup2
INSTRUCTIVE ENOUGH TO THE

03:12:36.178 --> 03:12:38.347 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER. AND WHETHER THE

03:12:37.413 --> 03:12:39.681 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER'S WILLING TO

03:12:38.347 --> 03:12:41.250 region:rollup2
ACCOMMODATE EMPLOYEE TO SAFELY

03:12:39.681 --> 03:12:42.951 region:rollup2
PERFORM FUNCTIONS BASED JUST

03:12:41.250 --> 03:12:45.187 region:rollup2
UPON IN IF IT'S IF IT'S NOT A

03:12:42.951 --> 03:12:45.854 region:rollup2
VERY SOLID RISK PRESCRIPTION. OR

03:12:45.187 --> 03:12:47.890 region:rollup2
SOMETHING MORE.

03:12:45.854 --> 03:12:49.958 region:rollup2
SO THE EMPLOYER CONTROLS THE

03:12:47.890 --> 03:12:52.327 region:rollup2
PROCESS OF INTERACTIVE PROCESS

03:12:49.958 --> 03:12:53.929 region:rollup2
AND IN IT IT AND IF IT'S AN

03:12:52.327 --> 03:12:55.998 region:rollup2
UNSATISFIED WITH A. POORLY

03:12:53.929 --> 03:12:56.532 region:rollup2
DRAFTED PRESCRIPTION.

03:12:55.998 --> 03:12:57.766 region:rollup2
THE EMPLOYER CAN DENY THE

03:12:56.532 --> 03:12:59.234 region:rollup2
ACCOMMODATION.

03:12:57.766 --> 03:13:01.470 region:rollup2
SO NOW AN EMPLOYER WHO HAS NO

03:12:59.234 --> 03:13:02.838 region:rollup2
MEDICAL.

03:13:01.470 --> 03:13:04.873 region:rollup2
KNOWLEDGE AT ALL IS GOING TO

03:13:02.838 --> 03:13:06.842 region:rollup2
EVALUATE WHETHER THIS IS A REAL

03:13:04.873 --> 03:13:10.279 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTION OR.

03:13:06.842 --> 03:13:10.779 region:rollup2
KIND OF LIKE WE GET BY BECAUSE.

03:13:10.279 --> 03:13:12.414 region:rollup2
WE DON'T WANT HEADACHES

03:13:10.779 --> 03:13:13.816 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTION.

03:13:12.414 --> 03:13:16.351 region:rollup2
I I DON'T MEAN TO MINIMIZE AND I

03:13:13.816 --> 03:13:16.952 region:rollup2
IN NO WAY GUYS I I. TOTALLY

03:13:16.351 --> 03:13:18.053 region:rollup2

I'M JUST IT JUST TO JUMP IN A

03:13:24.126 --> 03:13:26.528 region:rollup2
QUICK AT MY UNDERSTANDING IS

03:13:25.494 --> 03:13:28.030 region:rollup2
THAT THE MEDICAL RECOMMENDATIONS

03:13:26.528 --> 03:13:29.731 region:rollup2

QUANTITIES MAYBE SOMEONE ELSE

03:13:55.023 --> 03:13:58.494 region:rollup2

REALLY THINK THAT THERE'S SOME

03:14:31.293 --> 03:14:34.997 region:rollup2
THINGS MISSING. AND THIS IS ONE

03:14:33.295 --> 03:14:36.465 region:rollup2
OF MY BASIC QUESTIONS BECAUSE IT

03:14:34.997 --> 03:14:37.499 region:rollup2
IN THIS SITUATION SO WHAT I

03:14:36.465 --> 03:14:39.668 region:rollup2
ENVISION A MAYBE I HAVE THIS

03:14:37.499 --> 03:14:40.168 region:rollup2

.

03:14:42.704 --> 03:14:46.708 region:rollup2
MY FAULT FOR STAYING AWAY FROM

03:14:43.972 --> 03:14:48.577 region:rollup2
OTHERS CAMPUS POLICY. SO MUCH OF

03:14:46.708 --> 03:14:49.978 region:rollup2
WHAT I'M UNDERSTANDING IS.

03:14:48.577 --> 03:14:51.980 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK I HAVE A MEDICAL

03:14:49.978 --> 03:14:53.882 region:rollup2
CONDITION MIGHT DRAGREES WITH

03:14:51.980 --> 03:14:55.450 region:rollup2
ME FOR EXAMPLE I GET MIGRAINES

03:14:53.882 --> 03:14:57.619 region:rollup2
RIGHT. SO MY DOCTOR AGREES WITH

03:14:55.450 --> 03:15:01.089 region:rollup2
ME.

03:14:57.619 --> 03:15:03.358 region:rollup2
SHE PROVIDES ME WITH THE ABILITY

03:15:01.089 --> 03:15:05.093 region:rollup2
TO USE MEDICAL MARIJUANA.

03:15:03.358 --> 03:15:08.397 region:rollup2
IT'S UP TO ME TO DECIDE THE

03:15:05.093 --> 03:15:09.932 region:rollup2
DOSAGE THAT AMOUNT I USE WHEN I

03:15:08.397 --> 03:15:12.100 region:rollup2
USE THAT HOW I USE IT.

03:15:09.932 --> 03:15:13.435 region:rollup2
IN SO ONCE I GET THAT

WIDE I AGREE THAT THERE IS A

03:16:29.044 --> 03:16:31.046 region:rollup2
DISCREPANCY.

ANY BEST PRACTICES OR EXAMPLES

03:17:29.604 --> 03:17:33.308 region:rollup2
OF HOW THEY'VE ADDRESSED.

03:17:31.540 --> 03:17:35.977 region:rollup2
SOME OF THESE.

03:17:33.308 --> 03:17:36.144 region:rollup2
POSITIONS IN THE WORKPLACE.

03:17:35.977 --> 03:17:40.415 region:rollup2

03:17:36.144 --> 03:17:41.583 region:rollup2
SENSITIVE JOBS.

03:17:40.415 --> 03:17:42.784 region:rollup2
I'M SURE IT'S IT'S ONE THAT'S

03:17:41.583 --> 03:17:44.853 region:rollup2
BEEN ONE OF THE THE GREAT

03:17:42.784 --> 03:17:45.821 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS THAT WE'VE BEEN ASKING

03:17:44.853 --> 03:17:49.224 region:rollup2
AND AND ONE THAT WE CONTINUE TO

03:17:45.821 --> 03:17:49.825 region:rollup2
EXPLORE WITH SOME OF THOSE WHO

03:17:49.224 --> 03:17:52.527 region:rollup2
ARE CURRENTLY IN OPPOSITION.

03:17:49.825 --> 03:17:54.696 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE SOME OF THAT THE

03:17:52.527 --> 03:17:55.564 region:rollup2
CONTRACTORS. ARE WHO WORK WITH

03:17:54.696 --> 03:17:57.165 region:rollup2
WITH SOME OF THE LABOR UNIONS IN

03:17:55.564 --> 03:17:58.734 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA ALSO WORK IN SOME OF

03:17:57.165 --> 03:18:00.502 region:rollup2
THE STATES WHERE.

03:17:58.734 --> 03:18:01.636 region:rollup2
IT'S POLICY IS ALREADY IN PLACE

03:18:00.502 --> 03:18:03.505 region:rollup2
AND SO.

03:18:01.636 --> 03:18:04.873 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA HOPEFULLY HAVE A A

03:18:03.505 --> 03:18:05.941 region:rollup2
LONGER DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT

03:18:04.873 --> 03:18:07.309 region:rollup2
HAPPENED THERE HOW THEY'VE

03:18:05.941 --> 03:18:09.711 region:rollup2
ADDRESSED THESE ISSUES. HOW

03:18:07.309 --> 03:18:11.813 region:rollup2
SAFETY IS IS APPROPRIATELY

03:18:09.711 --> 03:18:13.415 region:rollup2
ACCOMMODATED IN AND ACCOUNTED

03:18:11.813 --> 03:18:15.016 region:rollup2
FOR? THE WITH THE WITH THE ONE

03:18:13.415 --> 03:18:15.584 region:rollup2
THING I'LL SAY SINCE SAFETY HAS

03:18:15.016 --> 03:18:17.552 region:rollup2
COME UP A NUMBER OF TIMES.

03:18:15.584 --> 03:18:20.222 region:rollup2
IS THAT.

03:18:17.552 --> 03:18:20.856 region:rollup2
REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION.

03:18:20.222 --> 03:18:21.957 region:rollup2
IT NEEDS TO BE ASKED FOR BY THE

03:18:20.856 --> 03:18:23.859 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEE.

03:18:21.957 --> 03:18:25.293 region:rollup2
AND IT NEED NOT BE GIVEN IF IT

03:18:23.859 --> 03:18:27.462 region:rollup2
WOULD POSE A DANGER TO THE

03:18:25.293 --> 03:18:29.631 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEE OR OTHERS.

03:18:27.462 --> 03:18:31.433 region:rollup2
SO THERE IS A STRONG SAFETY

03:18:29.631 --> 03:18:34.035 region:rollup2
PROTOCOL ALREADY BUILT IN.

03:18:31.433 --> 03:18:35.003 region:rollup2

WITH ALL THOSE.

03:20:13.935 --> 03:20:16.471 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT WOULD BE THE EXACT

03:20:15.036 --> 03:20:18.273 region:rollup2
SAME PROCESS SO YOU KNOW THERE'S

03:20:16.471 --> 03:20:20.108 region:rollup2
A CASE FROM LAST YEAR WERE.

03:20:18.273 --> 03:20:21.543 region:rollup2

RETROACTIVE IT'S ONLY

03:20:39.327 --> 03:20:42.797 region:rollup2
PROSPECTIVE. IS TOTALLY LEGAL SO

03:20:41.263 --> 03:20:45.533 region:rollup2

JUST THAT IF SOMEBODY HAD A

THE INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS IN

03:22:54.696 --> 03:22:58.266 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING NEW SO.

03:22:56.031 --> 03:23:00.535 region:rollup2

03:22:58.266 --> 03:23:01.403 region:rollup2
SO WHEN YOU HAVE EMPLOYERS IN A

03:23:00.535 --> 03:23:04.172 region:rollup2
POSITION WHERE.

03:23:01.403 --> 03:23:05.407 region:rollup2
.

SO AGAIN I MEAN EMPLOYERS DEAL

03:23:18.787 --> 03:23:21.456 region:rollup2
WITH US ALL THE TIME THOUGH GET

03:23:19.854 --> 03:23:23.191 region:rollup2
AN EMPLOYEE WHO SAYS.

03:23:21.456 --> 03:23:25.260 region:rollup2
THEY NEED TO TAKE LIKE IN AT

03:23:23.191 --> 03:23:26.461 region:rollup2
NIGHT BECAUSE I CAN'T SLEEP. AND

03:23:25.260 --> 03:23:27.996 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE DISCUSSION AND SEE IF

03:23:26.461 --> 03:23:29.064 region:rollup2
THEY WANT TO ACCOMMODATE THAT

03:23:27.996 --> 03:23:30.432 region:rollup2
PERSON AND IF THE PERSON IS IN A

03:23:29.064 --> 03:23:31.866 region:rollup2
SAFETY SENSITIVE POSITION THAT

03:23:30.432 --> 03:23:33.068 region:rollup2
MAY BE DRUG TESTED ARE THEY WHAT

03:23:31.866 --> 03:23:34.769 region:rollup2
ARE THEY GONNA DO.

03:23:33.068 --> 03:23:35.670 region:rollup2
AN EMPLOYER CAN DECIDE THAT A

03:23:34.769 --> 03:23:36.571 region:rollup2
COMBINATION OF NOT THEY HAVE A

03:23:35.670 --> 03:23:38.773 region:rollup2
MAJOR PROFESSIONALS OR THEY

03:23:36.571 --> 03:23:39.307 region:rollup2
DECIDE THEY ENGAGE IN THAT

03:23:38.773 --> 03:23:40.742 region:rollup2
PROCESS AND IF THEY'RE NOT

03:23:39.307 --> 03:23:41.342 region:rollup2
CONTENT.

03:23:40.742 --> 03:23:42.777 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S AN INTERACTIVE

03:23:41.342 --> 03:23:45.346 region:rollup2
PROCESS WITH WHAT THE EMPLOYER

03:23:42.777 --> 03:23:46.314 region:rollup2
PROVIDES. THEN THEY'LL SAY THAT

03:23:45.346 --> 03:23:46.881 region:rollup2
THERE'S THERE'S AND WE'RE NOT

03:23:46.314 --> 03:23:47.949 region:rollup2
GOING THE OTHER COMMENT YOU

03:23:46.881 --> 03:23:49.217 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

03:23:47.949 --> 03:23:49.718 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S NOT CLEAR

03:23:49.217 --> 03:23:50.251 region:rollup2
ENOUGH THAT YOU HAVE AN

03:23:49.718 --> 03:23:51.553 region:rollup2
IMPAIRMENT YOU MAY NOT BE

03:23:50.251 --> 03:23:53.688 region:rollup2
QUALIFIED.

03:23:51.553 --> 03:23:55.390 region:rollup2
AND SO IF THEY DO THIS ALL THE

03:23:53.688 --> 03:23:56.357 region:rollup2
TIME WHETHER THEY HAVE A TRAINED

03:23:55.390 --> 03:23:58.393 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONAL THAT DOES IT.

03:23:56.357 --> 03:23:59.294 region:rollup2
AND REVIEWS THE MEDICAL RECORD

03:23:58.393 --> 03:24:01.029 region:rollup2
OR THE NOTE FROM THE EMPLOYEE

03:23:59.294 --> 03:24:02.931 region:rollup2
THAT SAYS THE CANTOR CAMPS TO

03:24:01.029 --> 03:24:04.766 region:rollup2
SOMETHING OR NOT. SO THEY REALLY

03:24:02.931 --> 03:24:05.834 region:rollup2
HAVE A LEGAL OBLIGATION IF THEIR

03:24:04.766 --> 03:24:07.836 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER THAT'S UNDER THE FEE

03:24:05.834 --> 03:24:10.672 region:rollup2
HOW OR IF HE A TO ENGAGE IN THIS

03:24:07.836 --> 03:24:11.473 region:rollup2
PROCESS. AND SIMPLY THIS WE JUST

03:24:10.672 --> 03:24:13.041 region:rollup2
OUTLET THE EMPLOYEE ASK

03:24:11.473 --> 03:24:15.210 region:rollup2
IF AN EMPLOYEE HAS A BOGUS.

03:24:13.041 --> 03:24:16.611 region:rollup2
MEDICAL AUTHORIZATION FOR

03:24:15.210 --> 03:24:18.146 region:rollup2
CANNABIS OF THE EMPLOYER CAN ASK

03:24:16.611 --> 03:24:19.080 region:rollup2
FOR MORE.

03:24:18.146 --> 03:24:20.615 region:rollup2
BUT YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING MY

03:24:19.080 --> 03:24:22.450 region:rollup2
QUESTION ABOUT WHO DEFINES WHAT

03:24:20.615 --> 03:24:24.452 region:rollup2
IMPAIRED MEANS.

03:24:22.450 --> 03:24:26.020 region:rollup2
WELL.

03:24:24.452 --> 03:24:28.156 region:rollup2
THAT'S A SEPARATE ASPECT I MEAN

03:24:26.020 --> 03:24:29.023 region:rollup2
IMPAIR MEANS THAT IF AN EMPLOYEE

03:24:28.156 --> 03:24:30.492 region:rollup2
BELIEVES THAT IF AN EMPLOYER

03:24:29.023 --> 03:24:31.059 region:rollup2
BELIEVES IN EMPLOYEES IMPAIR

03:24:30.492 --> 03:24:32.861 region:rollup2
WORK WITH THE USUALLY DO IS

03:24:31.059 --> 03:24:34.262 region:rollup2
THEY.

03:24:32.861 --> 03:24:35.463 region:rollup2
DAVID MAKE OBSERVATIONS AND

03:24:34.262 --> 03:24:36.331 region:rollup2
DECIDE THAT THERE'S A REASONABLE

03:24:35.463 --> 03:24:38.133 region:rollup2
SUSPICION AND THEN THEY ORDER A

03:24:36.331 --> 03:24:39.534 region:rollup2
DRUG TEST.

03:24:38.133 --> 03:24:41.402 region:rollup2
AND IF THEY ORDER DRUG TEST.

03:24:39.534 --> 03:24:43.037 region:rollup2
AND THE EMPLOYEE IS NOT INFORM

03:24:41.402 --> 03:24:43.805 region:rollup2
THE EMPLOYER THAT THERE HAVE

03:24:43.037 --> 03:24:45.740 region:rollup2
SOME MEDICATION THAT HELPS THEY

03:24:43.805 --> 03:24:46.741 region:rollup2
CAN BE FIRED.

03:24:45.740 --> 03:24:47.242 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IF I THAT THE DRUG TESTS

03:24:46.741 --> 03:24:50.245 region:rollup2
OF THE EMPLOYER DECIDES

03:24:47.242 --> 03:24:51.579 region:rollup2
IMPAIRMENT BY OBSERVATION.

03:24:50.245 --> 03:24:52.447 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHAT THEY DO ALL THE

03:24:51.579 --> 03:24:54.282 region:rollup2
TIME I MEAN THIS STANDARD IS

03:24:52.447 --> 03:24:55.517 region:rollup2
YOUR OBSERVATION POST AN

03:24:54.282 --> 03:24:56.851 region:rollup2
ACCIDENT PRE EMPLOYMENT.

03:24:55.517 --> 03:24:58.553 region:rollup2
THEY'LL DO A TEST BUT IF

03:24:56.851 --> 03:24:59.521 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT SURE IF THEY BELIEVE

03:24:58.553 --> 03:25:00.989 region:rollup2
IN EMPLOYEE APPEARS IMPAIRED AT

03:24:59.521 --> 03:25:01.890 region:rollup2
WORK. THEN THEY'LL DO IT

03:25:00.989 --> 03:25:03.224 region:rollup2
OBSERVATION BILL THAT MAYBE HAVE

03:25:01.890 --> 03:25:05.493 region:rollup2
TO AND THEY DECIDE WHETHER THE

03:25:03.224 --> 03:25:07.929 region:rollup2
PERSON IS ACTING BIZARRE.

03:25:05.493 --> 03:25:09.497 region:rollup2
LOOKING DIFFERENT AND THEY CAN

03:25:07.929 --> 03:25:10.131 region:rollup2
ORDER PERSON TAKE A DRUG TEST.

03:25:09.497 --> 03:25:10.999 region:rollup2
WHEN THE EMPLOYEE SHOWS UP WITH

03:25:10.131 --> 03:25:12.534 region:rollup2
THAT WITH THE CERTIFICATION AND

03:25:10.999 --> 03:25:14.435 region:rollup2
SAYS.

03:25:12.534 --> 03:25:16.471 region:rollup2

03:26:26.808 --> 03:26:29.410 region:rollup2
IF YOU TELL THEM AHEAD OF TIME

03:26:28.343 --> 03:26:31.145 region:rollup2
THAT'S ONE THING IF YOU DON'T

03:26:29.410 --> 03:26:33.181 region:rollup2

WHAT DOES IMPAIRED MEAN WHO

03:26:40.188 --> 03:26:43.391 region:rollup2
DECIDES THAT AND IT DOESN'T

03:26:41.656 --> 03:26:44.692 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE THAT

03:26:43.391 --> 03:26:46.227 region:rollup2
YOU'RE DRIVING A TRUCK OR

03:27:00.708 --> 03:27:04.479 region:rollup2
SO FIRST OF ALL I AM NOT AWARE

03:27:02.210 --> 03:27:05.079 region:rollup2
OF ANY.

03:27:04.479 --> 03:27:06.881 region:rollup2
PACIFIC JOBS WHERE AN EMPLOYER

03:27:05.079 --> 03:27:09.250 region:rollup2
WOULD.

03:27:06.881 --> 03:27:10.084 region:rollup2
WANT OR WOULD ALLOW AN EMPLOYEE

03:27:09.250 --> 03:27:11.552 region:rollup2

THIS PARTICULAR JOB IT WOULD BE

03:27:14.822 --> 03:27:17.492 region:rollup2
OKAY.

03:27:16.090 --> 03:27:19.060 region:rollup2
AND AS FAR AS DETERMINING

03:27:17.492 --> 03:27:20.995 region:rollup2
IMPAIRMENT.

03:27:19.060 --> 03:27:23.598 region:rollup2
THERE IS NO DEFINITIVE METHOD TO

03:27:20.995 --> 03:27:25.433 region:rollup2
DO SO OTHER THAN THE ONLY ONE

03:27:23.598 --> 03:27:25.667 region:rollup2
THAT THAT I'VE THAT I'VE FOUND.

03:27:25.433 --> 03:27:27.402 region:rollup2
IS THE.

03:27:25.667 --> 03:27:29.337 region:rollup2
CH P. THEY HAVE A DRUG

RECOGNITION EXPERT AND IT IS A

03:27:29.337 --> 03:27:32.440 region:rollup2
MAJOR TRAINING AND THEN THEY SIT

03:27:31.272 --> 03:27:35.810 region:rollup2
AND OBSERVE THE INDIVIDUAL FOR

03:27:32.440 --> 03:27:36.944 region:rollup2
TWO HOURS.

03:27:35.810 --> 03:27:38.012 region:rollup2
TAKE THE BLOOD PRESSURE BUT AS

03:27:36.944 --> 03:27:38.913 region:rollup2
FAR AS A.

03:27:38.012 --> 03:27:40.949 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE OF

OTHER TESTS FOR TO.

03:27:46.254 --> 03:27:51.059 region:rollup2
DETERMINE OTHER OTHER TYPES OF.

03:27:48.656 --> 03:27:51.926 region:rollup2
DRUGS IN THE IN THE SYSTEM OR OR

03:27:51.059 --> 03:27:53.461 region:rollup2
IMPAIRMENT WHICH IS ALSO

03:27:51.926 --> 03:27:55.596 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT AND A LOT OF

03:27:53.461 --> 03:27:56.931 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS BUT FOR FOR MARIJUANA

03:27:55.596 --> 03:27:59.634 region:rollup2
IMPAIRMENT THERE THERE'S THERE

03:27:56.931 --> 03:28:00.902 region:rollup2
ISN'T ANYTHING THERE SOME. TESTS

03:27:59.634 --> 03:28:01.469 region:rollup2
THAT ARE IN DEVELOPMENT.

03:28:00.902 --> 03:28:03.438 region:rollup2
SO IT'S JUST.

03:28:01.469 --> 03:28:04.305 region:rollup2
IT'S IT CAN BE A JUDGMENT CALL

03:28:03.438 --> 03:28:06.641 region:rollup2
AND IF WERE.

03:28:04.305 --> 03:28:08.643 region:rollup2
.

03:28:06.641 --> 03:28:10.445 region:rollup2
WE HELLA EXPOSURE TOLITIGATION

03:28:08.643 --> 03:28:12.480 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE.

03:28:10.445 --> 03:28:14.615 region:rollup2
SUSPECT THAT AN EMPLOYEE IS

03:28:12.480 --> 03:28:17.218 region:rollup2
IMPAIRED BUT WE CAN'T PROVE IT

03:28:14.615 --> 03:28:20.488 region:rollup2
SO. IF WE HAVE A DRUG FREE

03:28:17.218 --> 03:28:22.357 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE POLICY NOW WE WILL

03:28:20.488 --> 03:28:24.525 region:rollup2
USES ZERO TOLERANCE.

03:28:22.357 --> 03:28:26.361 region:rollup2
LEVEL SO BUT UNDER.

03:28:24.525 --> 03:28:28.696 region:rollup2
A REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION IF WE

03:28:26.361 --> 03:28:30.898 region:rollup2
HAVE KNOWINGLY HIRED THE PERSON.

03:28:28.696 --> 03:28:33.134 region:rollup2
WITH A POSITIVE DRUG TEST FOR

03:28:30.898 --> 03:28:34.902 region:rollup2
TTC AND WE'VE ALLOWED WE'VE

03:28:33.134 --> 03:28:36.537 region:rollup2
HIRED THEM KNOWING THAT WE GIVE

03:28:34.902 --> 03:28:37.505 region:rollup2
THEM ACCOMMODATION IT DEPENDS ON

03:28:36.537 --> 03:28:39.240 region:rollup2
WHAT THE ACCOMMODATION IS BUT

03:28:37.505 --> 03:28:41.075 region:rollup2
THEN. WE DO A DRUG TEST TO TEST

03:28:39.240 --> 03:28:42.610 region:rollup2
THEM FOR IMPAIRMENT WE WE DON'T

03:28:41.075 --> 03:28:44.112 region:rollup2
HAVE ONE BECAUSE IF THEY'VE

03:28:42.610 --> 03:28:46.047 region:rollup2
ALREADY TOLD US THAT THEY'RE.

03:28:44.112 --> 03:28:47.281 region:rollup2
USING MARIJUANA THEY'RE GOING TO

03:28:46.047 --> 03:28:49.183 region:rollup2
HAVE TO USE IN THEIR SYSTEM AND

03:28:47.281 --> 03:28:52.053 region:rollup2
WE BASICALLY SAID THAT'S OKAY

03:28:49.183 --> 03:28:53.654 region:rollup2
WHEN WE HIRED THEM.

03:28:52.053 --> 03:28:55.089 region:rollup2
AS IN THE ISLAM THING AND

03:28:53.654 --> 03:28:55.890 region:rollup2
REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION.

03:28:55.089 --> 03:28:57.959 region:rollup2
OPEN THOSE THERE'S A QUESTION AS

03:28:55.890 --> 03:28:58.826 region:rollup2
TO HOW HOW THE TEST IS DONE AND

03:28:57.959 --> 03:29:01.295 region:rollup2
I HAVEN'T GOTTEN A STRAIGHT

03:28:58.826 --> 03:29:02.530 region:rollup2
ANSWER AS TO HOW HOW IF

03:29:01.295 --> 03:29:04.532 region:rollup2
IMPAIRMENT CAN MAKE. YOU CAN

03:29:02.530 --> 03:29:06.501 region:rollup2
FIND IMPAIRMENT YOU CAN FIND

03:29:04.532 --> 03:29:07.034 region:rollup2
OPIOIDS IN THE SYSTEM AND I

03:29:06.501 --> 03:29:08.069 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THERE'S A RANGE OF

03:29:07.034 --> 03:29:09.670 region:rollup2
LEVELS.

03:29:08.069 --> 03:29:10.972 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS

03:29:09.670 --> 03:29:12.273 region:rollup2
ONE THAT'S AGREED UPON THAT IS

03:29:10.972 --> 03:29:14.008 region:rollup2
IMPAIRMENT OR NOT

03:29:12.273 --> 03:29:18.579 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S NO STANDARD IN PLACE

03:29:14.008 --> 03:29:20.648 region:rollup2
FOR. OPIOIDS EITHER THAT.

03:29:18.579 --> 03:29:22.216 region:rollup2
I MEAN I'M I'M JUST TRYING THERE

03:29:20.648 --> 03:29:24.986 region:rollup2
THERE ARE.

03:29:22.216 --> 03:29:26.187 region:rollup2
I HAVE NOT I CAN TELL YOU I'M

03:29:24.986 --> 03:29:29.090 region:rollup2
I'M NOT CERTAIN I JUST READ IT

03:29:26.187 --> 03:29:30.858 region:rollup2
DEPENDS ON. YOUR YOUR.

03:29:29.090 --> 03:29:33.628 region:rollup2
YOUR BODY WEIGHT YOUR AGE YOUR

03:29:30.858 --> 03:29:34.829 region:rollup2
METABOLISM ALL MEDICINES AFFECT

03:29:33.628 --> 03:29:36.364 region:rollup2
YOU DIFFERENTLY THAT'S WHY

03:29:34.829 --> 03:29:37.965 region:rollup2
THERE'S RECOMMENDED DOSAGE DON'T

03:29:36.364 --> 03:29:39.834 region:rollup2
YOU EVEN JUMP IN THERE I SEE

03:29:37.965 --> 03:29:41.235 region:rollup2
LEANING FORWARD.

03:29:39.834 --> 03:29:42.370 region:rollup2
AND I WAS. THERE IS THAT THAT

03:29:41.235 --> 03:29:44.372 region:rollup2
RIGHT THERE IS A DIFFERENT

03:29:42.370 --> 03:29:46.874 region:rollup2
DOSAGE SO I WOULD IMAGINE THE

03:29:44.372 --> 03:29:50.111 region:rollup2
SAME IS TRUE FOR OPIOIDS.

03:29:46.874 --> 03:29:52.980 region:rollup2
OR FOR MARIJUANA OR ANYTHING

03:29:50.111 --> 03:29:54.515 region:rollup2
ELSE AND.

03:29:52.980 --> 03:29:56.017 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW YOU OKAY SO YOU GET A

03:29:54.515 --> 03:29:57.685 region:rollup2
PERSCRIPTION THAT IN YOUR DOCTOR

03:29:56.017 --> 03:29:59.854 region:rollup2
SAYS TAKE ONE BIKE AND IN THE

03:29:57.685 --> 03:30:00.855 region:rollup2
MORNING AND YOU DECIDE WELL I'M

03:29:59.854 --> 03:30:01.122 region:rollup2
REALLY A LOT OF PAIN SO MANY

03:30:00.855 --> 03:30:03.458 region:rollup2
TAKE TO.

03:30:01.122 --> 03:30:05.960 region:rollup2
WHILE.

03:30:03.458 --> 03:30:08.162 region:rollup2
HOW HOW IS SOMEONE SUPPOSED IN?

03:30:05.960 --> 03:30:10.465 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT IT I MEAN IT'S JUST

03:30:08.162 --> 03:30:13.067 region:rollup2
THIS IS REALLY COMPLICATED AND.

03:30:10.465 --> 03:30:14.635 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY I'M SAYING I CAN'T.

03:30:13.067 --> 03:30:15.937 region:rollup2
I'M JUST NOT THERE TODAY BECAUSE

03:30:14.635 --> 03:30:17.638 region:rollup2
IT FEELS LIKE WE HAVEN'T FIGURED

03:30:15.937 --> 03:30:19.240 region:rollup2
OUT ALL THE KINKS.

03:30:17.638 --> 03:30:21.142 region:rollup2
AND I THINK MY QUESTION IS TO

03:30:19.240 --> 03:30:22.276 region:rollup2
BOTH OF YOU HAVE MADE THAT

03:30:21.142 --> 03:30:24.011 region:rollup2
PRETTY CLEAR THAT WE DON'T HAVE

03:30:22.276 --> 03:30:26.681 region:rollup2
A LOT OF ANSWERS.

03:30:24.011 --> 03:30:28.316 region:rollup2
SAU I WE TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU

03:30:26.681 --> 03:30:30.184 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ARE NO ANSWERS AND IT

03:30:28.316 --> 03:30:31.319 region:rollup2
IS VERY COMPLICATED.

03:30:30.184 --> 03:30:32.453 region:rollup2
I MEAN FOR THE PEOPLE LIKE I

03:30:31.319 --> 03:30:33.788 region:rollup2
SAID AND I WILL WRAP BUT MISTER

03:30:32.453 --> 03:30:34.589 region:rollup2
CHAIRMAN I KNOW IT'S BEEN A LONG

03:30:33.788 --> 03:30:36.958 region:rollup2
HEARING.

03:30:34.589 --> 03:30:37.959 region:rollup2
BUT FOR.

03:30:36.958 --> 03:30:39.127 region:rollup2
WE YOU KNOW LIKE YOUR YOUR

03:30:37.959 --> 03:30:40.695 region:rollup2
GENTLEMAN WHO CAME WHO IS THE

03:30:39.127 --> 03:30:42.463 region:rollup2
VETERAN WHO TALKED ABOUT.

03:30:40.695 --> 03:30:44.198 region:rollup2
.

03:30:42.463 --> 03:30:45.967 region:rollup2
HIS HIS USE OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA

03:30:44.198 --> 03:30:47.268 region:rollup2
AND FOR THE MANY OTHER VETERANS

03:30:45.967 --> 03:30:49.137 region:rollup2
OUT THERE WHO ALSO NEEDED OR

03:30:47.268 --> 03:30:50.972 region:rollup2
ANYONE FRANKLY WHO'S NOT EVEN A

03:30:49.137 --> 03:30:52.507 region:rollup2
VETERAN PEOPLE OF LEGITIMATE.

03:30:50.972 --> 03:30:54.442 region:rollup2
USES FOR THIS TYPE OF.

03:30:52.507 --> 03:30:55.376 region:rollup2
TREATMENT.

03:30:54.442 --> 03:30:55.843 region:rollup2
AND DON'T WANT TO GO ON

03:30:55.376 --> 03:30:56.978 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS.

03:30:55.843 --> 03:31:00.047 region:rollup2
.

03:30:56.978 --> 03:31:02.016 region:rollup2
I THINK.

03:31:00.047 --> 03:31:04.252 region:rollup2
WHEN WE END UP PUTTING POLICIES

03:31:02.016 --> 03:31:06.621 region:rollup2
IN THE PLACE WHERE WE ALMOST.

03:31:04.252 --> 03:31:07.889 region:rollup2
DRIVE THEM RIGHT TO IT.

03:31:06.621 --> 03:31:08.890 region:rollup2
AND NOW WE HAVE THIS OPIOID

03:31:07.889 --> 03:31:09.991 region:rollup2
CRISIS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

03:31:08.890 --> 03:31:11.859 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE ON A

03:31:09.991 --> 03:31:13.828 region:rollup2
NATIONAL LEVEL NOT JUST A STATE

03:31:11.859 --> 03:31:15.763 region:rollup2
LEVEL. SO THERE'S THIS TENDENCY

03:31:13.828 --> 03:31:17.431 region:rollup2
TO THINK THAT IF A DOCTOR GIVES

03:31:15.763 --> 03:31:18.966 region:rollup2
IT TO YOU IT'S OKAY IT'S GOOD.

03:31:17.431 --> 03:31:21.102 region:rollup2
IF YOU DON'T GET IT FROM A

03:31:18.966 --> 03:31:25.039 region:rollup2
DOCTOR THAT IT'S THAT IT'S BAD

03:31:21.102 --> 03:31:27.175 region:rollup2
OR ITS I JUST.

03:31:25.039 --> 03:31:29.176 region:rollup2
GOOD LUCK.

03:31:27.175 --> 03:31:29.744 region:rollup2
THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY.

03:31:29.176 --> 03:31:30.211 region:rollup2
WELL THERE YOU HAVE IT GOOD

03:31:29.744 --> 03:31:32.313 region:rollup2

03:31:44.125 --> 03:31:47.695 region:rollup2
MEDICAL MARIJUANA.

03:31:45.593 --> 03:31:49.964 region:rollup2
REASON WE EVEN GOT INVOLVED IN

03:31:47.695 --> 03:31:51.165 region:rollup2
IT IS BECAUSE.

03:31:49.964 --> 03:31:53.134 region:rollup2
THIS IS A OF CALIFORNIA VOTED

03:31:51.165 --> 03:31:54.235 region:rollup2
FOR MEDICAL MARIJUANA WE CAN

03:31:53.134 --> 03:31:55.803 region:rollup2
COME OVER REGULATIONS FOR NINE

03:31:54.235 --> 03:31:56.437 region:rollup2
OR TEN YEARS.

03:31:55.803 --> 03:31:57.438 region:rollup2
AND IT TOOK THE EFFORTS OF FIVE

03:31:56.437 --> 03:31:59.073 region:rollup2
OF US

03:31:57.438 --> 03:32:00.408 region:rollup2
TO CONDUCT COALESCING BRINGING

03:31:59.073 --> 03:32:02.043 region:rollup2
TOGETHER A LOT OF IT BECAUSE OF

03:32:00.408 --> 03:32:03.344 region:rollup2
FEAR.

03:32:02.043 --> 03:32:05.346 region:rollup2
FEAR OF NEW THINGS FAIRLY

03:32:03.344 --> 03:32:07.014 region:rollup2
UNKNOWN. AND THERE WERE SEVERAL

03:32:05.346 --> 03:32:09.150 region:rollup2
SEVERAL ATTEMPTS.

03:32:07.014 --> 03:32:10.651 region:rollup2
TO PROMOTE REGULATIONS FOR THAT

03:32:09.150 --> 03:32:12.053 region:rollup2
AND WITH THE EFFORTS OF

03:32:10.651 --> 03:32:13.788 region:rollup2
BIPARTISAN EFFORT.

03:32:12.053 --> 03:32:16.490 region:rollup2
OF A LOT OF PEOPLE COMING

03:32:13.788 --> 03:32:17.825 region:rollup2
TOGETHER TO PUT THE ORIGINAL

03:32:16.490 --> 03:32:19.227 region:rollup2
MEDICAL MARIJUANA LAWS ENTER

03:32:17.825 --> 03:32:20.428 region:rollup2
INTO A FACT. AND I KNOW WE DID

03:32:19.227 --> 03:32:22.997 region:rollup2
IT.

03:32:20.428 --> 03:32:24.699 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE

03:32:22.997 --> 03:32:26.434 region:rollup2
PEOPLE GOT ACCESS.

03:32:24.699 --> 03:32:28.002 region:rollup2
TO REMEDIES THAT WE KNEW WOULD

03:32:26.434 --> 03:32:29.870 region:rollup2
HELP.

03:32:28.002 --> 03:32:31.906 region:rollup2
I WAS VETERANS WHAT IS GOOD

03:32:29.870 --> 03:32:33.908 region:rollup2
YOUNG PEOPLE WITHOUT CHRONIC

03:32:31.906 --> 03:32:35.910 region:rollup2
ILLNESSES SENIOR IF. WE KNEW

03:32:33.908 --> 03:32:38.746 region:rollup2
THAT THE MEDICINAL ELEMENTS OF

03:32:35.910 --> 03:32:40.581 region:rollup2
OF CANNABIS ARM. WERE VERY

03:32:38.746 --> 03:32:41.949 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT AND WE ALSO KNEW THAT

03:32:40.581 --> 03:32:42.583 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WEREN'T DOING IT.

03:32:41.949 --> 03:32:43.818 region:rollup2
OR THE PEOPLE THAT REALLY NEEDED

03:32:42.583 --> 03:32:45.686 region:rollup2
IT.

03:32:43.818 --> 03:32:48.756 region:rollup2
IT WENT ABOUT GETTING HOT.

03:32:45.686 --> 03:32:51.325 region:rollup2
AND AND SO I ALSO WANT TO SAY I

03:32:48.756 --> 03:32:51.926 region:rollup2
AM CONCERNED ABOUT BOTH SAFETY.

03:32:51.325 --> 03:32:53.227 region:rollup2
BUT THE OTHER THING THAT THE

03:32:51.926 --> 03:32:55.363 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR MESSAGES ABOUT

03:32:53.227 --> 03:32:57.131 region:rollup2
PRODUCTIVITY IN THE WORKPLACE.

03:32:55.363 --> 03:32:58.833 region:rollup2
REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DON'T

03:32:57.131 --> 03:33:00.835 region:rollup2
MISS THAT EITHER.

03:32:58.833 --> 03:33:01.802 region:rollup2
SAFETY IS REALLY IMPORTANT I

03:33:00.835 --> 03:33:03.738 region:rollup2
THINK WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH

03:33:01.802 --> 03:33:05.539 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES.

03:33:03.738 --> 03:33:06.807 region:rollup2
AND I AND I GUESS IN.

03:33:05.539 --> 03:33:08.442 region:rollup2
PLOY YEARS BUT WILL PROBABLY

03:33:06.807 --> 03:33:10.144 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES DIPPING A ROCK AND A

03:33:08.442 --> 03:33:13.314 region:rollup2
HARD PLACE BETWEEN TRYING TO

03:33:10.144 --> 03:33:15.016 region:rollup2
TELL YOU. HONESTLY WHAT I'M ON.

03:33:13.314 --> 03:33:16.150 region:rollup2
BUT BECAUSE WE KIND OF HAD THIS

03:33:15.016 --> 03:33:17.818 region:rollup2
REEFER MADNESS KIND

03:33:16.150 --> 03:33:19.387 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT CANNABIS

03:33:17.818 --> 03:33:21.022 region:rollup2
IS.

03:33:19.387 --> 03:33:22.523 region:rollup2
WE AUTOMATICALLY BELIEVE THAT

03:33:21.022 --> 03:33:23.424 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY THAT IT'S ON MEDICAL

03:33:22.523 --> 03:33:24.959 region:rollup2
MARIJUANA AUTOMATICALLY GETS

03:33:23.424 --> 03:33:27.395 region:rollup2
HIGH.

03:33:24.959 --> 03:33:29.030 region:rollup2
AND IS TEACH SEA LEVELS BETTER

03:33:27.395 --> 03:33:30.765 region:rollup2
CAN BE REALLY IN. NONE. TO VERY

03:33:29.030 --> 03:33:31.832 region:rollup2
VERY LOW.

03:33:30.765 --> 03:33:33.567 region:rollup2
AM WE NOT WE'RE NOT TALKING

03:33:31.832 --> 03:33:34.802 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

03:33:33.567 --> 03:33:36.737 region:rollup2
THAT EVERYBODY THAT'S ON MEDICAL

03:33:34.802 --> 03:33:38.339 region:rollup2
MARIJUANA.

03:33:36.737 --> 03:33:39.206 region:rollup2
CAN'T WALK AND CHEW GUM AT THE

03:33:38.339 --> 03:33:41.475 region:rollup2
SAME TIME.

03:33:39.206 --> 03:33:43.177 region:rollup2
.

03:33:41.475 --> 03:33:45.646 region:rollup2
YOU NO AND AND I GOT TO HEAR

03:33:43.177 --> 03:33:47.348 region:rollup2
THIS STUFF ABOUT IT DRIVE.

03:33:45.646 --> 03:33:49.617 region:rollup2
NOTEBOOK UP.

03:33:47.348 --> 03:33:51.018 region:rollup2
DRIVE TO DRUG OR PATHWAY DRIVE

03:33:49.617 --> 03:33:53.120 region:rollup2
YOU MIGHT IT MAYBE ALL OF THAT

03:33:51.018 --> 03:33:55.623 region:rollup2
BUT IT MAY NOT BE ALL THAT I

03:33:53.120 --> 03:33:58.059 region:rollup2
KNOW ONE THING YOU MAY NOT. BE.

03:33:55.623 --> 03:34:00.728 region:rollup2
A DRUG TO ANOTHER DRUG BUT IT.

03:33:58.059 --> 03:34:03.664 region:rollup2
IT DEFINITELY HAS HAD SOME GREAT

03:34:00.728 --> 03:34:04.899 region:rollup2
EFFECT ON AND HELPING PEOPLE AND

03:34:03.664 --> 03:34:06.634 region:rollup2
I WISH A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE

03:34:04.899 --> 03:34:08.703 region:rollup2
WOULD. USE A MODEM MEDICINAL

03:34:06.634 --> 03:34:10.204 region:rollup2
STUFF THAT'S OUT THERE THE MIGHT

03:34:08.703 --> 03:34:11.839 region:rollup2
EVEN CHANGE YOUR MIND ABOUT SOME

03:34:10.204 --> 03:34:14.475 region:rollup2
THE ELEMENT YOU HAVE AND WHETHER

03:34:11.839 --> 03:34:16.177 region:rollup2
NOT YOU CAN ACTUALLY OPERATE.

03:34:14.475 --> 03:34:18.312 region:rollup2
AND DO THINGS I MEAN THAT'S PART

03:34:16.177 --> 03:34:20.748 region:rollup2
OF THE PROBLEM RIGHT HERE THAT

03:34:18.312 --> 03:34:22.049 region:rollup2
THAT INDIVIDUALS.

03:34:20.748 --> 03:34:24.285 region:rollup2
BANKS ARE.

03:34:22.049 --> 03:34:25.386 region:rollup2
WELL.

03:34:24.285 --> 03:34:27.054 region:rollup2
I HAVEN'T SMOKED SINCE SEVENTY

03:34:25.386 --> 03:34:28.723 region:rollup2
NINE.

03:34:27.054 --> 03:34:30.358 region:rollup2
I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S SOME

03:34:28.723 --> 03:34:32.159 region:rollup2
STUFF OUT THERE. THAT.

03:34:30.358 --> 03:34:34.061 region:rollup2
BUT SO.

03:34:32.159 --> 03:34:35.496 region:rollup2
STRONG COMPARED TO WHAT WAS

03:34:34.061 --> 03:34:36.530 region:rollup2
GOING ON IN SEVENTIES. THAT YOU

03:34:35.496 --> 03:34:38.566 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT

03:34:36.530 --> 03:34:41.502 region:rollup2
ANYBODY GOING TO WORK.

03:34:38.566 --> 03:34:42.703 region:rollup2
IT IS SO STRONG BILL PASSED OUT.

03:34:41.502 --> 03:34:44.438 region:rollup2
AND SO JUSTICE IT WILL NEVER

03:34:42.703 --> 03:34:46.874 region:rollup2
HONEST DISCUSSION ABOUT THE

03:34:44.438 --> 03:34:49.310 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RECTORY

03:34:46.874 --> 03:34:50.411 region:rollup2
TIONAL USE OR ADULT USE. AND

03:34:49.310 --> 03:34:51.746 region:rollup2
MEDICAL BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE

03:34:50.411 --> 03:34:54.682 region:rollup2
TUMBLE MEDICAL HERE AND

03:34:51.746 --> 03:34:55.149 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY STAY ON MEDICAL.

03:34:54.682 --> 03:34:55.916 region:rollup2
BECAUSE A LOT OF THIS

03:34:55.149 --> 03:34:58.252 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION.

03:34:55.916 --> 03:35:00.254 region:rollup2
SEEM TO BE. DEVOLVED INTO

03:34:58.252 --> 03:35:01.889 region:rollup2
RECREATIONAL AND THAT'S THE ONE

03:35:00.254 --> 03:35:04.258 region:rollup2
THAT WE DO WE REALLY NEED TO BE

03:35:01.889 --> 03:35:05.860 region:rollup2
CONCERNED ABOUT PRODUCTIVITY.

03:35:04.258 --> 03:35:06.427 region:rollup2
AND SAFETY

03:35:05.860 --> 03:35:08.696 region:rollup2
SAFETY IS MOST IMPORTANT AND

03:35:06.427 --> 03:35:09.597 region:rollup2
THE.

03:35:08.696 --> 03:35:11.565 region:rollup2
THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY HAS A

03:35:09.597 --> 03:35:13.467 region:rollup2
VALID.

03:35:11.565 --> 03:35:15.302 region:rollup2
A VALID REASON.

03:35:13.467 --> 03:35:15.836 region:rollup2
TO BRING THIS UP I'M WORKING

03:35:15.302 --> 03:35:18.539 region:rollup2
WITH CHP ALONG WITH MISTER

03:35:15.836 --> 03:35:19.407 region:rollup2
BONTA.

DAY HAVE FIELD SOBRIETY TESTS

03:35:19.407 --> 03:35:22.676 region:rollup2
A CANNABIS.

03:35:21.208 --> 03:35:24.278 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WORKING ON INTO

03:35:22.676 --> 03:35:26.781 region:rollup2
PERFECTING FOOT WITH FUNDING

03:35:24.278 --> 03:35:29.016 region:rollup2
THAT CAME FROM US. EARLY ON WE

03:35:26.781 --> 03:35:30.785 region:rollup2
NEED TO GO AHEAD AND. BRING THAT

03:35:29.016 --> 03:35:32.920 region:rollup2
OUT TO THE FOREFRONT SO THAT

03:35:30.785 --> 03:35:34.321 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS CAN ACTUALLY USE SOME

03:35:32.920 --> 03:35:35.923 region:rollup2
OF THOSE.

03:35:34.321 --> 03:35:37.391 region:rollup2
THOSE TESTS FOR THE CONTEST

03:35:35.923 --> 03:35:39.727 region:rollup2
BEFORE IF SOMEONE TELLS YOU TO

03:35:37.391 --> 03:35:41.095 region:rollup2
USE IN IT YOU CAN DO THOSE TYPE

03:35:39.727 --> 03:35:43.497 region:rollup2
OF TEST DETERMINE WHETHER THAT

03:35:41.095 --> 03:35:45.366 region:rollup2
THEY CAN OPERATE. ON DANGERS

03:35:43.497 --> 03:35:46.734 region:rollup2
MACHINERY BECAUSE WE DO NOT I

03:35:45.366 --> 03:35:49.336 region:rollup2
REPEAT WE DO NOT WANT THEM

03:35:46.734 --> 03:35:50.004 region:rollup2
OPERATING ANY TYPE OF LOVE.

03:35:49.336 --> 03:35:52.006 region:rollup2
MACHINERY.

03:35:50.004 --> 03:35:53.808 region:rollup2
AGAIN THIS IS

03:35:52.006 --> 03:35:55.576 region:rollup2
NOT NINETEEN EIGHTEEN.

03:35:53.808 --> 03:35:57.978 region:rollup2
IS NOT DIG NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT

03:35:55.576 --> 03:35:59.513 region:rollup2
IS TWENTY EIGHTEEN.

03:35:57.978 --> 03:36:01.482 region:rollup2

03:36:42.189 --> 03:36:46.093 region:rollup2
A KIND A HEALTHY DISCOMFORT.

YOU KNOW I'LL SAY FOR MYSELF

03:36:46.093 --> 03:36:50.698 region:rollup2
THE IDEA OF SAFETY WAS PARAMOUNT

03:36:48.696 --> 03:36:51.298 region:rollup2
MY MIND IN SO MY FIRST REACTION

03:36:50.698 --> 03:36:53.400 region:rollup2
GUT REACTION WAS HOW CAN THIS

03:36:51.298 --> 03:36:54.568 region:rollup2
BE.

03:36:53.400 --> 03:36:55.936 region:rollup2
AND VERY SIMILAR TO THE

03:36:54.568 --> 03:36:56.737 region:rollup2
CONCERNS WE HEARD FROM OUR

03:36:55.936 --> 03:36:58.706 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS TODAY.

03:36:56.737 --> 03:37:00.174 region:rollup2
I.

03:36:58.706 --> 03:37:01.542 region:rollup2
I HAD THE BALANCE AND TEMPER

03:37:00.174 --> 03:37:02.810 region:rollup2
THAT AGAINST THE NOTION THAT

03:37:01.542 --> 03:37:05.679 region:rollup2
SOMEONE MIGHT NEED. AN

03:37:02.810 --> 03:37:07.715 region:rollup2
ACCOMMODATION AND THAT ARE OUR

03:37:05.679 --> 03:37:09.283 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS HAVE ALLOWED FOR THOSE

03:37:07.715 --> 03:37:11.418 region:rollup2
WHO HAVE THE NEED FOR AN

03:37:09.283 --> 03:37:12.720 region:rollup2
ACCOMMODATION TO HAVE IT. AND IT

03:37:11.418 --> 03:37:14.021 region:rollup2
IT IS THAT THAT ALLOWS ME TO

03:37:12.720 --> 03:37:15.222 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THIS TODAY.

03:37:14.021 --> 03:37:16.423 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE ARE QUESTIONS THAT

03:37:15.222 --> 03:37:18.692 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO ANSWER I THINK WE

03:37:16.423 --> 03:37:20.327 region:rollup2
HAVE TO ANSWER HOW. WE BALANCE

03:37:18.692 --> 03:37:23.163 region:rollup2
THE NEEDS OF ACCOMMODATION WITH

03:37:20.327 --> 03:37:24.632 region:rollup2
SAFETY OF FOR THOSE IN OUR

03:37:23.163 --> 03:37:26.834 region:rollup2
WORKPLACES IN THIS IS CLEARLY

03:37:24.632 --> 03:37:29.703 region:rollup2
NEW TERRITORY. AND AND SO I HOPE

03:37:26.834 --> 03:37:30.237 region:rollup2
THAT AS YOU GO FOR WITH THE BILL

03:37:29.703 --> 03:37:31.639 region:rollup2
YOU WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR

03:37:30.237 --> 03:37:33.440 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS. AND OTHER

03:37:31.639 --> 03:37:35.576 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS RAISE CONCERNS

03:37:33.440 --> 03:37:36.911 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW TO KEEP OUR WORKPLACE

03:37:35.576 --> 03:37:38.012 region:rollup2
A SAFE REGARDLESS OF THE TYPES

03:37:36.911 --> 03:37:39.580 region:rollup2
OF POSITIONS

03:37:38.012 --> 03:37:41.382 region:rollup2
IT JUST SEEMS THAT THERE COULD

03:37:39.580 --> 03:37:42.850 region:rollup2
BE THERE COULD BE CHALLENGES BUT

03:37:41.382 --> 03:37:44.218 region:rollup2
BUT THAT. WE DON'T DOT

03:37:42.850 --> 03:37:45.519 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES WE LOOK FOR WAYS TO

03:37:44.218 --> 03:37:47.054 region:rollup2
ANSWER THEM AND FIND WAYS TO

03:37:45.519 --> 03:37:48.455 region:rollup2
MOVE FORWARD IN WAYS THAT ARE

03:37:47.054 --> 03:37:50.057 region:rollup2
THOUGHTFUL AND SO.

03:37:48.455 --> 03:37:51.392 region:rollup2
THIS BILL HAS A DO PASS

03:37:50.057 --> 03:37:53.360 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION.

03:37:51.392 --> 03:37:54.695 region:rollup2
I HOPE THAT YOU WILL ALSO

03:37:53.360 --> 03:37:55.195 region:rollup2
ADDRESSED THE CONCERNS WE HEARD

03:37:54.695 --> 03:37:56.163 region:rollup2
FROM PLAYERS TODAY ABOUT

03:37:55.195 --> 03:37:57.264 region:rollup2
LIABILITY.

03:37:56.163 --> 03:37:58.332 region:rollup2
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH THE LAW

03:37:57.264 --> 03:37:59.400 region:rollup2
SAYS ONE THING AROUND

03:37:58.332 --> 03:38:00.834 region:rollup2
ACCOMMODATIONS.

03:37:59.400 --> 03:38:02.503 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT OUR EMPLOYERS

03:38:00.834 --> 03:38:03.504 region:rollup2
COULD ALSO BE SUSCEPTIBLE AROUND

03:38:02.503 --> 03:38:05.839 region:rollup2
LIABILITY.

03:38:03.504 --> 03:38:07.908 region:rollup2
AND SO WE WOULD ASK THAT.

03:38:05.839 --> 03:38:09.577 region:rollup2
YOU MAKE THAT A KEY FOCUS OF

03:38:07.908 --> 03:38:11.278 region:rollup2
YOUR WORK WON'T FOR WITH

03:38:09.577 --> 03:38:12.246 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS IN OUR STAKEHOLDERS

03:38:11.278 --> 03:38:14.448 region:rollup2
I HAVE DO PASS RECOMMENDATION.

03:38:12.246 --> 03:38:17.051 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE CLOSER TO THE COUPLE

03:38:14.448 --> 03:38:17.985 region:rollup2
GOOD QUICK COMMENTS FIRST.

03:38:17.051 --> 03:38:18.953 region:rollup2
I LOOK FOURTEEN ADDITIONAL

03:38:17.985 --> 03:38:19.820 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

03:38:18.953 --> 03:38:20.988 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION THERE'S THERE'S

03:38:19.820 --> 03:38:22.122 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT I'M OPEN MINDED TOOK

03:38:20.988 --> 03:38:23.524 region:rollup2
TO LEARN ABOUT TO ADDRESS TO

03:38:22.122 --> 03:38:25.125 region:rollup2
IMPROVE ON.

03:38:23.524 --> 03:38:26.226 region:rollup2
AT TO THINK ABOUT I THINKS AND

03:38:25.125 --> 03:38:27.227 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE THINGS WHAT WHAT

03:38:26.226 --> 03:38:28.862 region:rollup2
WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT TOGETHER

03:38:27.227 --> 03:38:30.431 region:rollup2
DID IT'S IT'S SOME SOMEWHAT OF

03:38:28.862 --> 03:38:30.798 region:rollup2
OF NEW TERRITORY.

03:38:30.431 --> 03:38:32.299 region:rollup2
SO THE FOR TO.

03:38:30.798 --> 03:38:33.500 region:rollup2
.

03:38:32.299 --> 03:38:35.069 region:rollup2
A CLEVER PROCESS TO IS TO

03:38:33.500 --> 03:38:37.071 region:rollup2
EXPLORE AND STRENGTH IN THIS

03:38:35.069 --> 03:38:38.973 region:rollup2
BILL I THINK A LOT OF THAT

03:38:37.071 --> 03:38:40.274 region:rollup2
CONCERNS I'VE HEARD TODAY. ARE

03:38:38.973 --> 03:38:41.842 region:rollup2
NOT SPECIFICALLY ABOUT MEDICAL

03:38:40.274 --> 03:38:43.744 region:rollup2
CANNABIS THERE ABOUT THE

03:38:41.842 --> 03:38:44.812 region:rollup2
EXISTING FEE HOUSE SYSTEM AND

03:38:43.744 --> 03:38:45.579 region:rollup2
REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION THAT'S

03:38:44.812 --> 03:38:47.281 region:rollup2
BEEN THE LAW FOR MULTIPLE

03:38:45.579 --> 03:38:47.815 region:rollup2
DECADES AND HOW IT APPLIES TO TO

03:38:47.281 --> 03:38:50.684 region:rollup2
ALL.

03:38:47.815 --> 03:38:52.853 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBE MEDICINES ALL WORK

03:38:50.684 --> 03:38:54.788 region:rollup2
AND AND AND. YOU KNOW I THINK

03:38:52.853 --> 03:38:55.956 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE WATCH THINGS LIKE CSI

03:38:54.788 --> 03:38:58.092 region:rollup2
AND OTHER THINGS WE EXPECT THE

03:38:55.956 --> 03:38:58.559 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF EXACTITUDE WHERE YOU

03:38:58.092 --> 03:39:00.961 region:rollup2
KNOW.

03:38:58.559 --> 03:39:04.198 region:rollup2
WITH THE LEVEL OF PRECISION AND

03:39:00.961 --> 03:39:05.132 region:rollup2
AND AND CERTAINTY THAT SOMETHING

03:39:04.198 --> 03:39:07.468 region:rollup2
IT ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OR NOT

03:39:05.132 --> 03:39:09.136 region:rollup2
BUT. EMPLOYERS ACROSS THIS

03:39:07.468 --> 03:39:10.471 region:rollup2
STATE HAVE FOR FOR MANY MANY

03:39:09.136 --> 03:39:13.073 region:rollup2
YEARS NOW.

03:39:10.471 --> 03:39:14.375 region:rollup2
DEALT WITH JUDGMENT CALLS AND A

03:39:13.073 --> 03:39:15.542 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE INDICIA AND FACTORS

03:39:14.375 --> 03:39:16.610 region:rollup2
THAT LEAD TOWARD THE DECISION

03:39:15.542 --> 03:39:18.012 region:rollup2
ABOUT IMPAIRMENT.

03:39:16.610 --> 03:39:19.713 region:rollup2
AND DECISION ABOUT WHAT

03:39:18.012 --> 03:39:20.347 region:rollup2
ACCOMPLISHES. WHAT WHAT

03:39:19.713 --> 03:39:21.749 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTES REASONABLE

03:39:20.347 --> 03:39:22.616 region:rollup2
ACCOMMODATION AND THAT WHAT THAT

03:39:21.749 --> 03:39:24.551 region:rollup2
WILL CONTINUE?

03:39:22.616 --> 03:39:26.687 region:rollup2
WITH WITH WITH ANOTHER MEDIC

03:39:24.551 --> 03:39:27.988 region:rollup2
MEDICINE A MEDICINE FRANKLY THAT

03:39:26.687 --> 03:39:28.956 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF

03:39:27.988 --> 03:39:30.591 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA DECIDED.

03:39:28.956 --> 03:39:32.026 region:rollup2
OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO WAS

03:39:30.591 --> 03:39:32.626 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT.

03:39:32.026 --> 03:39:34.261 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA PATIENTS HAVE

03:39:32.626 --> 03:39:36.063 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO AND THESE ARE PATIENTS

03:39:34.261 --> 03:39:37.865 region:rollup2
WHO ARE BATTLING EPILEPSY WHO

03:39:36.063 --> 03:39:38.766 region:rollup2
ARE BATTLING CANCER FOR SOME FOR

03:39:37.865 --> 03:39:40.567 region:rollup2
WHOM THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO

03:39:38.766 --> 03:39:41.568 region:rollup2
TAKE. HAVEN'T TO TO GET RID OF

03:39:40.567 --> 03:39:43.370 region:rollup2
THAT PAIN.

03:39:41.568 --> 03:39:44.772 region:rollup2
THAT THAT MAKES OUR LIFE

03:39:43.370 --> 03:39:45.239 region:rollup2
IMPOSSIBLE TO LIVE

03:39:44.772 --> 03:39:47.641 region:rollup2
SO.

03:39:45.239 --> 03:39:48.776 region:rollup2
I THINK THOSE PATIENTS DESERVE

03:39:47.641 --> 03:39:50.277 region:rollup2
NOT TO BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST

03:39:48.776 --> 03:39:52.980 region:rollup2
IN THE WORKPLACE

I THINK THAT. THAT.

03:39:52.980 --> 03:39:55.683 region:rollup2

03:39:57.951 --> 03:40:00.087 region:rollup2
WHOLE REASON WE GO THROUGH THE

LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IS TO GET
