00:14:06.979 --> 00:14:08.948
PLACE IN OUR LIVING ROOM. SO I

00:14:09.014 --> 00:14:09.982
GREW UP WITH THE IDEA OF

00:14:10.049 --> 00:14:12.117
UNDERSTANDING THE VALUE VOTING.

00:14:12.184 --> 00:14:13.085
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO NOT BE

00:14:13.152 --> 00:14:14.753
ABLE TO VOTE. I LIVE IN A

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:16.188
COMMUNITY THAT HAD LIMITED

00:14:16.255 --> 00:14:17.957
VOTING IN TERMS OF PEOPLE NOT

00:14:18.023 --> 00:14:19.091
HAVING FAITH IN THE PROCESS OF

00:14:19.158 --> 00:14:20.693
VOTING. NOT BELIEVING THAT IT

00:14:20.759 --> 00:14:22.161
WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE. AND

00:14:22.228 --> 00:14:24.296
DESPITE THAT. MY FATHER MOTHER

00:14:24.363 --> 00:14:25.831
BELIEVE SO STRONGLY IN VOTING

00:14:25.898 --> 00:14:27.299
THEY ENCOURAGED EVERYONE TO

00:14:27.366 --> 00:14:28.701
VOTE. BANKERS ALL OF THE

00:14:28.767 --> 00:14:30.169
CHILDREN AND THE GRANDCHILDREN

00:14:30.236 --> 00:14:32.004
THEIR NIECES AND NEPHEWS VOTE.

00:14:32.071 --> 00:14:34.206
BECAUSE HE REALIZE WHAT LIMIT

00:14:34.273 --> 00:14:36.208
HE HAD IN DEFENDING HIS LIFE.

00:14:36.275 --> 00:14:37.243
WHEN HE WAS CHALLENGED AT THE

00:14:37.309 --> 00:14:39.011
WAY STATION BECAUSE HE WAS THEY

00:14:39.078 --> 00:14:40.446
WERE CHEATING HIM OUT OF HIS

00:14:40.512 --> 00:14:42.514
ANNUAL MONEY. AND HE FOUGHT

00:14:42.581 --> 00:14:45.084
BACK. AND FIGHTING BACK WOULD

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:46.352
MAKE HIS DEATH. AND YET HE

00:14:46.418 --> 00:14:47.853
STOOD FIRM BECAUSE HE BELIEVED

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.154
IN THAT IT HE KNEW THAT HE

00:14:49.221 --> 00:14:50.289
WANTED HIS CHILDREN HAVE A

00:14:50.356 --> 00:14:51.123
PLACE WITH IT WAS EQUAL

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:53.092
OPPORTUNITY AND ACCESS. SO I

00:14:53.158 --> 00:14:54.226
GREW UP WITH THIS KIND OF A

00:14:54.293 --> 00:14:55.294
COMMITMENT THAT VOTING IS

00:14:55.361 --> 00:14:57.463
IMPORTANT. DIGNITY IS

00:14:57.529 --> 00:15:00.232
IMPORTANT. BEING JUST FIGHTING

00:15:00.299 --> 00:15:01.033
FOR JUSTICE AND EQUALITY IS

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.302
IMPORTANT. AND I KNEW THAT WHEN

00:15:03.369 --> 00:15:05.971
I FINISH TO UCLA. AND GOT MY

00:15:06.038 --> 00:15:07.940
FINAL DEGREE AND WAS TEACHING.

00:15:08.007 --> 00:15:09.008
THAT I WOULD BE WHAT THEY CALL

00:15:09.074 --> 00:15:10.909
A SCHOLAR ACTIVISTS. I'D BE

00:15:10.976 --> 00:15:12.144
SOMEONE WHO NOT TO STUDY THE

00:15:12.211 --> 00:15:13.812
BOOKS AND WENT INTO MY OWN

00:15:13.879 --> 00:15:15.881
COCOON. AND TAUGHT MY CLASSES.

00:15:15.948 --> 00:15:17.516
BUT I DO MY BEST TO ELEVATE MY

00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:18.951
COMMUNITY. TO EDUCATE THE

00:15:19.018 --> 00:15:20.419
COMMUNITY TO MAKE SURE THEY HAD

00:15:20.486 --> 00:15:22.488
ACCESS TO THOSE THINGS. SO WHEN

00:15:22.554 --> 00:15:23.689
I'M CONFRONTED WITH THE ISSUE

00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:25.691
OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE. AND

00:15:25.758 --> 00:15:27.860
THEN THE RESPONSIBILITY IT HAS.

00:15:27.926 --> 00:15:28.994
IT'S ALMOST KIND OF IRONIC THAT

00:15:29.061 --> 00:15:30.963
A MAN WHO NEVER WAS ALLOWED TO

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:32.898
VOTE. NOW HAS A DAUGHTER WHO IS

00:15:32.965 --> 00:15:34.333
RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THE

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.335
VOTES OF FORTY MILLION PEOPLE

00:15:36.402 --> 00:15:37.936
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:15:38.003 --> 00:15:40.539
WHAT IS TURN OF EVENTS. WHAT A

00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:42.741
CHANGE. IN CALIFORNIA. AND I

00:15:42.808 --> 00:15:43.842
RECOGNIZE THAT THAT IS AN

00:15:43.909 --> 00:15:45.544
AWESOME RESPONSIBILITY THAT IS

00:15:45.611 --> 00:15:47.046
FILLED WITH MANY CHALLENGES AS

00:15:47.112 --> 00:15:49.148
WE FACE THE- THE CRISIS TODAY.

00:15:49.214 --> 00:15:50.449
WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO DISCREDIT

00:15:50.516 --> 00:15:52.484
VOTING WANT TO ALTER VOTING

00:15:52.551 --> 00:15:53.719
WANTED MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT

00:15:53.786 --> 00:15:55.220
TO VOTE. MAKE IT HARD FOR

00:15:55.287 --> 00:15:56.789
PEOPLE TO VOTE. AND WE SAW IN

00:15:56.855 --> 00:15:58.057
THE LAST ELECTION SOME

00:15:58.123 --> 00:16:00.893
TRAGEDIES THAT WE SAW. BUT WE

00:16:00.959 --> 00:16:01.560
ALSO SAW CALIFORNIA RISE TO THE

00:16:01.627 --> 00:16:03.228
OCCASION. YOU KNOW THE FACT

00:16:03.295 --> 00:16:04.363
THAT MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN A

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:05.164
PART OF WITH WRITING

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:06.598
LEGISLATION AND I'VE BEEN ON

00:16:06.665 --> 00:16:07.232
THE BRETTLER ELECTIONS

00:16:07.299 --> 00:16:09.201
COMMITTEE FOR YEARS. WE WILL

00:16:09.268 --> 00:16:10.502
LEGISLATION THAT WENT FORTH AND

00:16:10.569 --> 00:16:11.870
PEOPLE THOUGHT WELL MAYBE WE'LL

00:16:11.937 --> 00:16:13.572
USE IT MAYBE WE WON'T. YOU HAVE

00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:15.074
AN OPTION TO DO IT OR NOT TO DO

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:16.709
IF YOU WANTED TO MAIL BALLOTS

00:16:16.775 --> 00:16:18.610
AND SO FORTH AND SO ON. SO WHEN

00:16:18.677 --> 00:16:20.612
COLE BECAME AND ELECTION.

00:16:20.679 --> 00:16:22.381
CALIFORNIA WAS PREPARED. YOU

00:16:22.448 --> 00:16:23.615
KNOW WE HAD A GLITCH IS ENOUGH

00:16:23.682 --> 00:16:25.150
THINGS THAT FELL APART BUT IN

00:16:25.217 --> 00:16:26.552
THE END. WITH THE GENERAL

00:16:26.618 --> 00:16:27.986
ELECTION WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT WE

00:16:28.053 --> 00:16:29.855
HAD OVER 80% OF OUR PEOPLE

00:16:29.922 --> 00:16:31.990
VOTING. UNBELIEVABLE AND I CAN

00:16:32.057 --> 00:16:33.492
REMEMBER TIMES WHEN WE WERE

00:16:33.559 --> 00:16:35.227
PRAYING FOR FORTY AND FIFTY.

00:16:35.294 --> 00:16:38.564
WITH 80% VOTING. WE ALSO HAD TO

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:40.599
SAVE VOTING. WE HAD MULTIPLE

00:16:40.666 --> 00:16:42.334
DAYS VOTING AVAILABILITY FOR

00:16:42.401 --> 00:16:43.769
FOLKS TO BE ABLE TO VOTE.

00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:45.671
COMFORTABLY WITHOUT HAVING TO

00:16:45.738 --> 00:16:47.573
BE STRESSED ABOUT VOTING. AND

00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:48.974
WE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT IT. AND

00:16:49.041 --> 00:16:50.175
I'M HOPING THAT AS WE MOVE

00:16:50.242 --> 00:16:51.710
FORWARD IN THIS OFFICE THAT WE

00:16:51.777 --> 00:16:53.345
WILL TAKE WHAT WE'VE LEARNED.

00:16:53.412 --> 00:16:54.313
AND BEGIN TO INSTITUTIONALIZE

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:58.717
MORE OF IT. IN OUR OWN

00:16:58.784 --> 00:16:59.284
PRACTICES TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:16:59.351 --> 00:16:59.918
VOTING IS X. PASSABLE. THAT WE

00:16:59.985 --> 00:17:01.520
REACH EVERY IT NEEDS TO THAT

00:17:01.587 --> 00:17:03.122
HAS ABOUT. TO WANTS TO. AND

00:17:03.188 --> 00:17:03.922
THAT MY TASK MAKE SURE WE ALL.

00:17:03.989 --> 00:17:05.491
HAVE THOSE SAFE PLACE BUT ALSO

00:17:05.557 --> 00:17:07.226
THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE. AND

00:17:07.292 --> 00:17:08.994
THAT EVERY CONCERN IS A MAJOR

00:17:09.061 --> 00:17:10.596
CONCERN. BECAUSE WHEN YOU

00:17:10.662 --> 00:17:12.030
OVERLOOK THE SMALL THINGS IT IS

00:17:12.097 --> 00:17:13.332
THE SMALL THINGS THAT THAT THAT

00:17:13.399 --> 00:17:14.900
KNOCKED YOU OUT. THAT HAVE A

00:17:14.967 --> 00:17:16.535
TENDENCY TO DESTROY THE GOOD

00:17:16.602 --> 00:17:17.770
THINGS THAT WE HAVE. AND

00:17:17.836 --> 00:17:19.104
THERE'S NO QUESTION WE'RE IN A

00:17:19.171 --> 00:17:20.639
TIME IN OUR HISTORY WE MUST.

00:17:20.706 --> 00:17:21.974
FIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.042
VOTING SYSTEM IS SECURE. THAT

00:17:24.109 --> 00:17:25.344
THOSE WHO SHOULD BE VOTING ARE

00:17:25.411 --> 00:17:26.645
VOTING. THAT WE MAKE

00:17:26.712 --> 00:17:27.713
OPPORTUNITIES FOR FOLKS THAT

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:28.947
THERE IS NO INTIMIDATION THERE

00:17:29.014 --> 00:17:30.382
WAS NO EFFORT TO DESTROY

00:17:30.449 --> 00:17:31.650
PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO HAVE THEIR

00:17:31.717 --> 00:17:33.218
INPUT. BECAUSE THEIR VOICE IS

00:17:33.285 --> 00:17:35.421
IMPORTANT AND I KNOW WHAT IT'S

00:17:35.487 --> 00:17:36.021
LIKE WHEN YOUR VICE IS TAKEN

00:17:36.088 --> 00:17:38.357
AWAY. AND SO I'M HONORED TO BE

00:17:38.424 --> 00:17:40.058
HERE TODAY WITH YOU TO TALK TO

00:17:40.125 --> 00:17:41.193
ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS I'VE

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:42.294
TALKED WITH MOST OF YOU ABOUT

00:17:42.361 --> 00:17:43.495
ELECTIONS YOU KNOW MY PASSION

00:17:43.562 --> 00:17:45.230
ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW HOW WE GOING

00:17:45.297 --> 00:17:46.398
TO WORK VERY HARD TO MAKE SURE

00:17:46.465 --> 00:17:47.733
THAT THINGS WE'VE INSTITUTED

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.268
WILL CONTINUE TO BE THERE. THAT

00:17:49.334 --> 00:17:50.969
CYBER SECURITY IS ALWAYS A JOB

00:17:51.036 --> 00:17:52.504
THAT NEVER ENDS. AND I'VE

00:17:52.571 --> 00:17:53.972
TALKED TO SEVERAL TIMES OUR

00:17:54.039 --> 00:17:55.174
CYBER SECURITY FOLKS TO REALIZE

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.508
THAT. THIS IS THIS IS SOMETHING

00:17:56.575 --> 00:17:58.677
YOU DO EVERY DAY ALL THE TIME

00:17:58.744 --> 00:17:59.411
THAT WE HAVE TO STAY ON TOP OF

00:17:59.478 --> 00:18:01.079
WITH WORKING. WE HAVE TO MAKE A

00:18:01.146 --> 00:18:02.414
TRUE THOUGH VOTING ROLLS ARE

00:18:02.481 --> 00:18:04.383
ACCURATE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:06.118
AND AND WE'VE SEEN SOME SOME

00:18:06.185 --> 00:18:07.286
GROWTH IN SOME AREAS BUT

00:18:07.352 --> 00:18:08.720
CLEARLY WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO

00:18:08.787 --> 00:18:10.022
WORK WITH THOSE AREAS THAT HAVE

00:18:10.088 --> 00:18:11.623
SOME CHALLENGES WITH THAT. BUT

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:13.091
I'M USUALLY IN INVOLVED IN

00:18:13.158 --> 00:18:14.226
CONCERNED ABOUT BUSINESS AND

00:18:14.293 --> 00:18:15.627
MAKING SURE THAT CALIFORNIA IS

00:18:15.694 --> 00:18:16.862
BECAUSE FRIENDLY BIZ AT BUSY.

00:18:16.929 --> 00:18:19.665
BUSY FRIENDLY. THAT WE HAVE ALL

00:18:19.731 --> 00:18:20.966
FOR FORTUNE FORTUNE WE HAVE

00:18:21.033 --> 00:18:22.634
BASICALLY COMPUTERIZED A LOT

00:18:22.701 --> 00:18:23.602
ABOUT THINGS BECAUSE OF. THAT

00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:24.736
ONLY A PUBLIC OF WHAT WAS IN

00:18:24.803 --> 00:18:26.839
PLACE. AND TO BEGIN TO POSSIBLY

00:18:26.905 --> 00:18:28.307
ASK BUSINESSES WERE HOW WELL

00:18:28.373 --> 00:18:29.908
WE'RE DOING. CAN WE MOVE

00:18:29.975 --> 00:18:31.577
FORWARD. WITH THE WHAT KINDS OF

00:18:31.643 --> 00:18:33.412
OPPORTUNITIES DO WE HAVE TO

00:18:33.479 --> 00:18:35.481
ENSURE CALIFORNIA IS A PLACE

00:18:35.547 --> 00:18:36.882
FOR BUSINESS FRIENDLY. AND I.

00:18:36.949 --> 00:18:38.050
AND I COME AT THAT NOT SIMPLY

00:18:38.116 --> 00:18:39.551
BECAUSE IT MOST FOLKS BECAUSE

00:18:39.618 --> 00:18:41.353
THE BOTTOM LINE. AND IT IS IN

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:43.489
MANY WAYS IN THE STATE. BUT

00:18:43.555 --> 00:18:45.123
IT'S ALSO THE LIFE OF PEOPLE. I

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:46.692
KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE WHEN. MY

00:18:46.758 --> 00:18:48.727
DAD DROVE FROM FORTY FIFTH AND

00:18:48.794 --> 00:18:50.429
BROADWAY. OVER TO THE CITY OF

00:18:50.496 --> 00:18:53.332
COMMERCE. AND SOLVE EVERY YEAR.

00:18:53.398 --> 00:18:55.167
THE ELIMINATION OF BUSINESSES.

00:18:55.234 --> 00:19:00.506
THAT. WERE IMPORTANT SO FAR

00:19:00.572 --> 00:19:03.175
STONE. COULD BE IF. IT'LL BE

00:19:03.242 --> 00:19:05.577
STEEL HE WORKED IN LAW AND SAW

00:19:05.644 --> 00:19:07.479
THE COMPANY ONE ONE. AND THE

00:19:07.546 --> 00:19:08.447
FEAR THAT IT HAD IN THE OF MIND

00:19:08.514 --> 00:19:09.781
TO THOSE WHO HARD ALL THEIR

00:19:09.848 --> 00:19:11.283
LIVES TO HAVE SOME KIND OF THE

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:13.118
INSECURITY THIS FEAR

00:19:13.185 --> 00:19:14.253
UNFORTUNATELY FOR MY DAD HE

00:19:14.319 --> 00:19:16.221
RETIRED FROM THIRTY THREE YEARS

00:19:16.288 --> 00:19:17.689
AT THE BLISS OF LOCKING IN

00:19:17.756 --> 00:19:22.127
MARCH OF NINETEEN. NINETEEN

00:19:22.194 --> 00:19:22.761
EIGHTY THREE. ALEX AND EMMA HAS

00:19:22.828 --> 00:19:25.264
PLANT CLOSE IN JUNE OF NINETEEN

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:27.132
EIGHTY THREE. HE MISSED ABOUT

00:19:27.199 --> 00:19:29.034
TWO MONTHS. HE WAS SO HAPPY.

00:19:29.101 --> 00:19:30.669
BUT HE FELT VERY BAD ABOUT ALL

00:19:30.736 --> 00:19:31.603
THE YOUNG MAN WHO WORKED IN

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:33.205
THAT PLANT. WHO WOULD NOT HAVE

00:19:33.272 --> 00:19:35.541
A PLACE ANYMORE. SO I'M VERY

00:19:35.607 --> 00:19:36.675
CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT WE

00:19:36.742 --> 00:19:37.676
NEED TO BE BUSINESS FRIENDLY WE

00:19:37.743 --> 00:19:39.344
NEED TO HAVE GOOD JOBS WE NEED

00:19:39.411 --> 00:19:40.279
TO BE PUT TO ENCOURAGE THOSE

00:19:40.345 --> 00:19:41.513
WITH THE ACT. AND TO MAKE IT

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:43.582
EASIER FOR THEM TO BASICALLY DO

00:19:43.649 --> 00:19:44.950
BUSINESS AND TO LISTEN TO THEM

00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:46.385
AND THEIR CONCERNS WITH REGARDS

00:19:46.451 --> 00:19:47.786
TO WHAT WE'RE NOT DOING RIGHT.

00:19:47.853 --> 00:19:49.288
IN ORDER TO MAKE IT EASIER

00:19:49.354 --> 00:19:50.422
BECAUSE IT IS EXTREMELY

00:19:50.489 --> 00:19:51.690
IMPORTANT NOT JUST AS THE

00:19:51.757 --> 00:19:52.691
BOTTOM LINE BUT BECAUSE OF THE

00:19:52.758 --> 00:19:54.660
LIVES OF THE INDIVIDUALS. AND

00:19:54.726 --> 00:19:56.261
AS A KID I KNOW WHAT HAPPENS

00:19:56.328 --> 00:19:58.797
WHEN SOMEBODY LAID OFF. WITH

00:19:58.864 --> 00:19:59.364
SOMEBODY WHEN THERE'S A CUT

00:20:09.741 --> 00:20:10.842

AND MOST FOLKS DON'T KNOW I'M

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:13.512

00:20:13.579 --> 00:20:15.714
THE ARCHIVES OF CALIFORNIA. OF

00:20:15.781 --> 00:20:16.982

THINGS WE OVERCOME. ARE

00:20:33.365 --> 00:20:34.967
IMPORTANT. AND THE FACT THAT

00:20:35.033 --> 00:20:37.102
PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND. THAT

00:20:37.169 --> 00:20:39.638
THE CIVIC NATURE OF OUR

00:20:42.674 --> 00:20:44.676
SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE. WE

00:20:44.743 --> 00:20:45.611

THAT TO STRENGTHEN THAT IN THE

00:20:56.655 --> 00:20:57.856
STRENGTH OF THE OPPORTUNITY FOR

00:20:57.923 --> 00:20:58.890

THINGS THAT ARE REALLY UNIQUE.

00:21:02.127 --> 00:21:03.729
AND IMPORTANT FOR US. AND THAT

00:21:03.795 --> 00:21:04.863
DRIVES US TO THE END TO MAKE A

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:06.164
DIFFERENCE A DECISION THAT IS

00:21:06.231 --> 00:21:07.332
DIFFERENT WITH REGARDS TO

BY SIMPLY SAYING I AM HONORED

00:21:12.337 --> 00:21:14.139
TO BE HERE TODAY- AS I. SAID

00:21:14.206 --> 00:21:15.440
WHEN I FIRST WAS TAPPED ON THE

SOME OF MY FRIENDS I SAID WELL.

00:21:21.713 --> 00:21:23.682
IT COULD BE A GOOD THING. AND

00:21:23.749 --> 00:21:24.716

SHOULD BE. BECAUSE THERE'S A

00:21:30.956 --> 00:21:32.457

TO CERTAINLY OUR- AND HONORING

00:26:01.693 --> 00:26:03.228
OF THE CONCERTS OF UNITED IS.

00:26:03.295 --> 00:26:08.333
THE USE AND STATE CALIFORNIA. I

HEARD THE- CA- IT WOULD IN AND

00:26:10.335 --> 00:26:11.736

00:26:15.373 --> 00:26:17.442
JUST AND BE OF COAL IT- WILL

00:26:17.509 --> 00:26:18.009
EXIT AS LONG AS WE ARE IN A

00:26:18.076 --> 00:26:19.945
PANDEMIC- WHEN THAT. BELIEVE IN

00:26:20.011 --> 00:26:20.679
THERE'S NO FOR THAT THEN I'LL

00:26:20.745 --> 00:26:22.147
BE WE GO BACK TO THE RULES THAT

THE ELECTION PROCESS AND SO

00:26:27.052 --> 00:26:29.621
FORTH AND SO ON SO- BUT I THINK

SOME UNUSUAL SITUATIONS THAT WE

00:26:33.825 --> 00:26:35.393
HAVE TO DEAL WITH AT THE TIME-

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:36.995
SO I SEE NO REASON WHY WE WOULD

00:26:37.062 --> 00:26:38.363
RETAIN OF THAT PARTICULAR

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:40.332

DURING THAT TIME KEEPING HEAR

00:26:52.644 --> 00:26:54.446
ME MORE CLEARLY. I THINK IT WAS

00:26:54.512 --> 00:26:56.815
AN- KIND OF AN OLDER. REACTION

00:26:56.881 --> 00:26:58.783

00:33:50.061 --> 00:33:51.062
YEAR OLDS TO VOTE IN LIKE

00:33:51.129 --> 00:33:52.597
SCHOOL BOARD ELECTIONS VERSUS

00:33:52.663 --> 00:33:54.399
OTHER ELECTIONS AND- AND

00:33:54.465 --> 00:33:55.933
WHETHER NOT THAT MEETS THE

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.368
STANDARD. REGARDS TO THAN THE

00:33:57.435 --> 00:33:58.903
OVERALL NATIONAL STANDARDS AND

00:33:58.970 --> 00:33:59.737
I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

00:33:59.804 --> 00:34:01.272
AT SOME POINT. MAYBE LITIGATED

00:34:01.339 --> 00:34:02.840
WITH REGARDS TO THE VOTING

00:34:02.907 --> 00:34:04.675
RIGHTS AND WITH THE NOT THERE

00:34:04.742 --> 00:34:05.143
ARE THESE THAT I KNOW

00:34:05.209 --> 00:34:06.444
NATIONALLY TO TRY TO GET SOME

00:34:06.511 --> 00:34:08.513
STANDARDS. WHICH I THINK COULD

00:34:08.579 --> 00:34:09.547
BE HELPFUL BUT ALSO COULD BE

00:34:09.614 --> 00:34:11.282
DANGEROUS AT THE SAME TIME. IF

00:34:11.349 --> 00:34:12.617
YOU HAVE SOME STANDARDS THAT

00:34:12.683 --> 00:34:13.885

CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IT BUT I

00:34:20.024 --> 00:34:22.760

WE'LL LOOK INTO IT IS THAT IT'S

00:36:14.305 --> 00:36:16.040
GOTTEN BETTER- IN TERMS OF

00:36:16.107 --> 00:36:17.275
BEING ABLE TO SCRUB THE ROLE SO

00:36:17.341 --> 00:36:19.443
MAKING SURE THAT THE- THAT THE

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:20.678
REGISTER VOTERS IS DIRECTLY

00:36:20.745 --> 00:36:21.913
CONNECTED TO THE BILL OF

STATISTICS AND SO WE- SO WE

00:36:23.648 --> 00:36:24.348
HAVE SOME IDEA OF WHO'S DYING

00:36:24.415 --> 00:36:27.985

LEFT IN A DILIGENT ABOUT. BUT

00:36:37.094 --> 00:36:38.896
THEMSELVES BASICALLY LETTING US

00:36:38.963 --> 00:36:40.131
KNOW THEY MOVE OR THE FAMILY

00:36:40.197 --> 00:36:41.666
MEMBERS OR WHATEVER SO. I KNOW

00:36:41.732 --> 00:36:43.501
THERE'S AN EFFORT TO COSTLY DO

00:36:43.568 --> 00:36:44.101
THAT AND MAKE SURE WAS

00:36:44.168 --> 00:36:45.937
SCRUBBING THE ROLES AND- AND IT

00:36:46.003 --> 00:36:47.805
IS AGAINST THE- IT IS ILLEGAL

00:36:47.872 --> 00:36:49.307

00:36:49.373 --> 00:36:50.441
DO HAVE THAT AS AS AN AS AN

00:36:50.508 --> 00:36:52.743
OPTION. BUT BUT I KNOW THAT THE

00:36:52.810 --> 00:36:54.412
L. A. IS WORKING ON IT AND IN

00:36:54.478 --> 00:36:55.947
THE SAME WAY I HEAR STORY. AS

00:36:56.013 --> 00:36:57.281

00:37:08.693 --> 00:37:09.594
UP A LITTLE BIT BETTER.

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:11.095
OBVIOUSLY AND WITH THAT AND

00:37:11.162 --> 00:37:13.397

01:20:26.121 --> 01:20:27.856
REASONS THAT THERE HAS BEEN

01:20:27.923 --> 01:20:29.758

WE HAVE I HAVE TRIED AND I KNOW

01:20:35.297 --> 01:20:35.964
THE OTHER BOARD MEMBERS HAVE

01:20:36.031 --> 01:20:38.099
ALSO WORKED. TO INSTILL A

01:20:38.166 --> 01:20:39.634
CULTURE OF CIVILITY AND

01:20:39.701 --> 01:20:42.037
COLLEGIALITY AT THE BOARD SO IT

01:20:42.103 --> 01:20:44.206
LEAST INTERNALLY WE ARE ABLE TO

01:20:44.272 --> 01:20:47.576
DO THAT- AS BOARD MEMBERS YOU

01:20:47.642 --> 01:20:49.477

01:20:51.746 --> 01:20:53.582
VERY FIERCE BATTLE TO GET THIS

THOSE TENSIONS YOU KNOW HAD

01:20:58.420 --> 01:20:59.521
PRECEDED THE CREATION OF THE

01:20:59.588 --> 01:21:01.523
BOARD FOR OVER A DECADE AND I

01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:03.391
THINK CONTINUED ON. AND WHILE I

01:21:03.458 --> 01:21:04.492
DO THINK THERE ARE STILL SOME

01:21:04.559 --> 01:21:06.361
OF THAT THAT STRIFE I THINK

01:21:06.428 --> 01:21:07.295
OVER THE YEARS WE HAVE

01:21:07.362 --> 01:21:09.130
