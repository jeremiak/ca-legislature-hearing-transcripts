WERE TEN CITIES AND COUNTIES IN

00:31:41.532 --> 00:31:43.001
CALIFORNIA THAT SUIT DO ST PAINT

00:31:43.067 --> 00:31:44.335
COMPANIES REPRESENTING I THINK

00:31:44.402 --> 00:31:46.204
FORTY SEVEN PERCENT OF OUR

00:31:46.271 --> 00:31:48.573
STATE'S POPULATION. AND AFTER

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.108
THAT TIME PERIOD A TRIAL COURT

00:31:50.174 --> 00:31:51.409
FOUND IN APPELLATE COURT

00:31:51.476 --> 00:31:53.011
AFFIRMED AND A CALIFORNIA

00:31:53.077 --> 00:31:55.179
SUPREME COURT DID NOT OVERTURN.

00:31:55.246 --> 00:31:57.181
THE RULING THAT THE NEGLIGENCE

00:31:57.248 --> 00:31:58.950
OF THE PAINT COMPANIES CREATED A

00:31:59.017 --> 00:32:01.152
WIDESPREAD PUBLIC NUISANCE WHICH

00:32:01.219 --> 00:32:02.487
THE COMPANIES WERE ORDERED TO

00:32:02.553 --> 00:32:03.788
ABATE.

00:32:03.855 --> 00:32:04.522
I THINK MANY OF US WERE

00:32:04.589 --> 00:32:06.591
SURPRISED SOME MONTHS AGO TO

00:32:06.658 --> 00:32:07.725

00:32:07.792 --> 00:32:09.761

IF VOTERS.

00:32:17.235 --> 00:32:19.537
SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT TAXPAYERS

00:32:19.604 --> 00:32:20.705
AND NOT THESE COMPANIES THAT

00:32:20.772 --> 00:32:22.407

00:32:25.843 --> 00:32:28.880
QUESTIONS ABOUT OF WHAT WE NEED

00:32:28.946 --> 00:32:30.615

THEY HAD CONTRIBUTED TO A PUBLIC

00:38:43.521 --> 00:38:46.190
NUISANCE.

00:38:46.257 --> 00:38:47.692
THE COURT RULED IN FAVOR OF THE

00:38:47.758 --> 00:38:49.026
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND ORDERED

00:38:49.093 --> 00:38:51.495
THE CREATION OF A FUND TO PAY

00:38:51.562 --> 00:38:53.264
FOR. PAID FOR BY THE PAINT

00:38:56.701 --> 00:38:59.170
FIFTY ONE.

00:38:59.236 --> 00:39:00.705
WHILE THE FINAL AMOUNT OF THAT

00:39:00.771 --> 00:39:02.473
FUND IS YET TO BE DETERMINED THE

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:03.574
COMPANIES INVOLVED IN THE

00:39:03.641 --> 00:39:05.443
LAWSUIT LIKELY WILL PAY HUNDREDS

00:39:05.509 --> 00:39:06.711
OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TOWARDS

00:39:06.777 --> 00:39:09.246
US FUND.

00:39:09.313 --> 00:39:10.748
THE MEASURE DOES TWO PRIMARY

00:39:10.815 --> 00:39:12.750
THINGS THE FIRST IS THAT IT

00:39:12.817 --> 00:39:15.152
DECLARES LEAD BASED PAINT IN OR

00:39:15.219 --> 00:39:16.587
ON HOMES IS NOT A PUBLIC

00:39:16.654 --> 00:39:18.589
NUISANCE.

00:39:18.656 --> 00:39:20.458
AS A RESULT PINK COMPANIES WOULD

00:39:20.524 --> 00:39:21.992
NO LONGER BE REQUIRED TO PAY

00:39:22.059 --> 00:39:24.662
INTO THE FUND I JUST DESCRIBED.

00:39:24.729 --> 00:39:26.697
IN ADDITION A COURT COULD NOT

00:39:26.764 --> 00:39:27.531
FIND.

00:39:27.598 --> 00:39:29.233
THAT LEAD PAINT COMPANIES

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:31.802
CONTRIBUTED TO A PUBLIC NUISANCE

00:39:31.869 --> 00:39:32.803
AND THEREFORE REQUIRE THEM TO

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:34.205
PAY TO ADDRESS THAT PARTICULAR

00:39:34.271 --> 00:39:36.073
ISSUE.

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:38.709
IN FUTURE LEGAL ACTION AND.

00:39:38.776 --> 00:39:39.844
THE SECOND THING THAT THE

00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:41.011
MEASURE DOES IS THAT IT

00:39:41.078 --> 00:39:42.780
AUTHORIZES THE STATE TO SELL TWO

00:39:42.847 --> 00:39:44.448
BILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL

00:39:44.515 --> 00:39:46.383
OBLIGATION BONDS TO ADDRESS

00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:48.385
HAZARDS INCLUDING MOLD LED US

00:39:48.452 --> 00:39:50.154
FESTUS ITS OUTER UP. IN HOMES

00:39:50.221 --> 00:39:53.057
SCHOOLS AND SENIOR FACILITIES.

00:39:53.124 --> 00:39:54.592
THE BULK OF THE FUNDS ONE POINT

00:39:54.658 --> 00:39:56.794
FIVE BILLION DOLLARS WOULD BE

00:39:56.861 --> 00:39:58.162
DEDICATED TO ADDRESSING HAZARDS

00:39:58.229 --> 00:40:00.297
AND HOMES.

00:40:00.364 --> 00:40:01.866
THE MEASURE SPECIFIES THAT THE

00:40:01.932 --> 00:40:02.700
DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND

00:40:02.767 --> 00:40:03.968
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT WOULD

00:40:04.034 --> 00:40:05.936
ADMINISTER THE FUNDS AND THAT IT

00:40:06.003 --> 00:40:07.171
WOULD BE A COMPETITIVE GRANT.

00:40:07.238 --> 00:40:08.906
PROCESS AND THE MEASURE

00:40:08.973 --> 00:40:10.841
SPECIFIES PRIORITY IS FOR

00:40:10.908 --> 00:40:13.077
DISTRIBUTING THOSE FUNDS.

00:40:13.144 --> 00:40:14.478
THERE ARE TWO PRIMARY FISCAL

00:40:14.545 --> 00:40:17.014
IMPACTS OF THE MEASURE.

00:40:17.081 --> 00:40:18.516
THE FIRST IS THAT WOULD REDUCE

00:40:18.582 --> 00:40:20.117
FUNDING TO ADDRESS LEAD BASED

00:40:20.184 --> 00:40:22.286
PAINT IN THE JURISDICTIONS PARTY

00:40:22.353 --> 00:40:24.488
TO THE LAWSUIT BEING DISCUSSED.

00:40:24.555 --> 00:40:25.823
IT WOULD ALSO PREVENT OTHER

00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:27.992
JURISDICTIONS FROM SEEKING FUNDS

00:40:28.058 --> 00:40:30.461
IN A SIMILAR MANNER.

00:40:30.528 --> 00:40:32.596
THE SECOND FISCAL IMPACT IS THAT

00:40:32.663 --> 00:40:33.297
WOULD INCREASE STATE DEBT

00:40:33.364 --> 00:40:35.332
PAYMENTS.

00:40:35.399 --> 00:40:36.667
STATE DEBT PAYMENTS FOR THESE

00:40:36.734 --> 00:40:37.868
BONDS WOULD BE ROUGHLY HUNDRED

00:40:37.935 --> 00:40:39.904
AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:41.705
OVER THE NEXT THIRTY FIVE YEARS

00:40:41.772 --> 00:40:43.440
THE TOTAL COST OF THE BONDS.

00:40:43.507 --> 00:40:44.809
WOULD COME TO ROUGHLY THREE

00:40:44.875 --> 00:40:46.243
POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS

00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:47.578
THOUGH THE TOTAL COST WOULD VERY

00:40:47.645 --> 00:40:49.280
ON AND A NUMBER OF FACTORS

00:40:49.346 --> 00:40:49.880
INCLUDING WHEN THE BONDS WERE

00:40:49.947 --> 00:40:51.816
ISSUED.

00:40:51.882 --> 00:40:52.416
WITHOUT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY

00:40:52.483 --> 00:40:54.952
QUESTIONS.

00:40:55.019 --> 00:40:56.387
MIKE I GUESS THE ONE THE

00:40:56.453 --> 00:40:58.189
QUESTIONS IS THIS.

00:40:58.255 --> 00:41:00.191
THE INITIATIVE IS EXPANDING THE

00:41:00.257 --> 00:41:01.692
SCOPE FROM LEAD PAINT.

00:41:01.759 --> 00:41:03.961
.

00:41:04.028 --> 00:41:06.163
BEFORE NINETEEN FIFTY ONE INTO

00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:09.633
ASBESTOS AND MOLD AND THE LIKE

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:11.802
DO WE THIS INITIATIVE COVER THE

00:41:11.869 --> 00:41:14.038
TRUE COST OF THE BAIT ALL THESE

00:41:14.104 --> 00:41:16.674
DIFFERENT ILL SET. A HIGHER OR

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:18.075
HAS USE THAT ARE BEING POSTPONED.

00:41:18.142 --> 00:41:20.277
THE PUBLIC.

00:41:20.344 --> 00:41:21.846
YOU ARE CORRECT THAT THE THE THE

00:41:21.912 --> 00:41:24.648
BONDS CAN PAY FOR A ADDRESSING

00:41:24.715 --> 00:41:26.050
HAZARDS THAT OUR MUCH BROADER

00:41:26.116 --> 00:41:26.984
THAN SIMPLY JUST LEAD BASED

00:41:27.051 --> 00:41:28.552
PAINT.

00:41:28.619 --> 00:41:29.920
WHETHER OR NOT TO BILLION

00:41:29.987 --> 00:41:31.388
DOLLARS WOULD BE SUFFICIENT.

00:41:31.455 --> 00:41:33.991
TO REMEDIATE ALL OF THESE

00:41:34.058 --> 00:41:35.659
HAZARDS ACROSS THE STATE IS NOT

00:41:35.726 --> 00:41:36.660
SOMETHING WE COULD EASILY

00:41:36.727 --> 00:41:39.063
DETERMINE BECAUSE WE HAVE NO.

00:41:39.129 --> 00:41:40.397
REAL DATE ON SORT OF THE

00:41:40.464 --> 00:41:42.366
PREVALENCE OF OR THE COST ON A

00:41:42.433 --> 00:41:45.302
STATEWIDE BASIS OF THESE ITEMS.

00:41:45.369 --> 00:41:47.304
AND I GUESS THE IS THAT.

00:41:47.371 --> 00:41:49.807
GENERALLY SPEAKING IS THAT IN

00:41:49.874 --> 00:41:52.142
THIS BARN INITIATIVE I

00:41:52.209 --> 00:41:54.178
CONSISTENT WITH PRUDENT. PUBLIC

00:41:54.245 --> 00:41:56.046
POLICY THAT WE HAVE A AS AN

00:41:56.113 --> 00:41:57.648
APPROPRIATE USE OF THE GENERAL

00:41:57.715 --> 00:41:59.283
BOND OBLIGATION.

00:41:59.350 --> 00:42:00.618
FUNCTION.

00:42:00.684 --> 00:42:02.820
BUT.

00:42:02.887 --> 00:42:04.889
WELL WE CAN'T TAKE A POSITION ON

00:42:04.955 --> 00:42:07.057
THE MEASURE AND AND THE RELATIVE

00:42:07.124 --> 00:42:08.592
POLICY MERITS OF OF.

00:42:08.659 --> 00:42:10.961
BOND ISSUANCE THE STATE HAS

00:42:11.028 --> 00:42:12.263
ISSUED BONDS FOR A NUMBER OF

00:42:12.329 --> 00:42:12.897
DIFFERENT.

00:42:12.963 --> 00:42:15.132
REASONS THROUGH VOTER VOTER

00:42:15.199 --> 00:42:16.934
INITIATIVES OR THROUGH ACT.

00:42:17.001 --> 00:42:18.168
WILL ACTUALLY HEY ALL HAVE TO

00:42:18.235 --> 00:42:19.470
BE APPROVED BY THE VOTERS OF

THEIR GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS.

00:42:20.738 --> 00:42:22.640
.

00:42:22.706 --> 00:42:24.408
THE RELATIVE MERITS OF THIS

00:42:24.475 --> 00:42:25.042
PARTICULAR BOND IS NOT SOME THAT

00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:26.810
WE COULD WEIGH IN ON.

DO WE KNOW IF.

00:42:28.679 --> 00:42:30.247
IF IT DID NOT HAVE THE NUMBERS

00:42:30.314 --> 00:42:31.982
TO BILLION DO WE EVEN KNOW IF

00:42:32.049 --> 00:42:32.816
THAT'S ENOUGH TO DO THE

00:42:32.883 --> 00:42:35.319
REMEDIATION FOR ALL THE LEADS

00:42:35.386 --> 00:42:37.254

FOR. THE LEAD.

00:42:44.428 --> 00:42:46.630
CONTAMINATION THAT EXCESS.

00:42:46.697 --> 00:42:47.831
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING.

00:42:47.898 --> 00:42:50.000

00:44:42.379 --> 00:44:43.914
WAS POINTED OUT HAS REVERSED THE

DECISION BY TRANSFERRING THE

BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE

00:44:54.792 --> 00:44:56.226
IS FAIRLY CLEAR THAT SAYING THAT

00:44:56.293 --> 00:44:57.895

THE LITIGATION AND SINCE THEN A

00:46:27.718 --> 00:46:28.485
NUMBER OF THINGS THAT HAVE

00:46:28.552 --> 00:46:29.786
HAPPENED IN THE LITIGATION. BUT

00:46:29.853 --> 00:46:30.954
I THINK WE HELPFUL TO OUR

00:46:31.021 --> 00:46:33.190
DISCUSSION TODAY. WE ALSO.

00:46:33.257 --> 00:46:34.992

LEGISLATURE CAN DO AS WELL.

00:46:43.233 --> 00:46:45.169
AS PART OF THE NORMAL

00:46:45.235 --> 00:46:47.104
OPERATIONS OF THE LEGISLATURE OR

00:46:47.171 --> 00:46:48.605
IN THE ALTERNATIVE. TO THE

00:46:48.672 --> 00:46:50.140
INITIATIVE BECAUSE OF THINGS

00:46:50.207 --> 00:46:51.575
THAT HAVE HAPPENED OVER THE LAST

00:46:51.642 --> 00:46:53.710
SIX MONTHS THE LITIGATION I

00:46:53.777 --> 00:46:54.244
THINK THERE ARE NUMBER OF

00:46:54.311 --> 00:46:55.846
OPPORTUNITIES WHERE. WE CAN

00:46:55.913 --> 00:46:57.548
EXPLORE TOGETHER. WAYS THAT ARE

00:46:57.614 --> 00:46:59.016
ONLY CHERYL WILLIAMS.

00:46:59.082 --> 00:47:01.251
CONAGRA AND OTHER COMPANIES CAN

00:47:01.318 --> 00:47:01.952
WORK TOGETHER WITH THE

00:47:02.019 --> 00:47:03.687
LEGISLATURE TO DO THINGS THAT

00:47:03.754 --> 00:47:04.154
ARE IMPORTANT FOR ALL

00:47:04.221 --> 00:47:05.989
CALIFORNIANS.

00:47:06.056 --> 00:47:06.657
I WANT TO START WITH SOME AND I

00:47:06.723 --> 00:47:08.392
DESERVE THEM LET ME FIRST POINT

00:47:08.458 --> 00:47:10.561
OUT THAT THIS IS A HEARING ON

00:47:10.627 --> 00:47:11.728
THE BALLOT MEASURE ITSELF.

00:47:11.795 --> 00:47:13.697
AND SO ANY YOU DISCUSSION

00:47:13.764 --> 00:47:15.766
BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE THAT

00:47:15.832 --> 00:47:17.201
PROPONENTS AND THE SORT OF

00:47:17.267 --> 00:47:18.936
OUTSIDE OF THAT IS IS NOT REALLY

00:47:19.002 --> 00:47:21.171
THE TOPIC HERE QUESTIONS FROM

00:47:21.238 --> 00:47:22.806
THE DIETS. MAY LEAD US IN THAT

00:47:22.873 --> 00:47:24.041
DIRECTION DEPENDING ON WHERE

00:47:24.107 --> 00:47:25.709
LEGISLATORS ONE AGO BUT I WOULD

00:47:25.776 --> 00:47:28.278
ASK THE PANEL TO FOCUS ON THE

00:47:28.345 --> 00:47:29.213
BALLOT MEASURE THAT'S THE

00:47:29.279 --> 00:47:31.281
SUBJECT MATTER. OF THIS HEARING

00:47:31.348 --> 00:47:32.683
ABSOLUTELY AND I DON'T WANT TO

00:47:32.749 --> 00:47:34.384
DIVERT FROM THAT AT ALL SO LET

00:47:34.451 --> 00:47:35.786
ME START THEN SPECIFICALLY WITH

00:47:35.852 --> 00:47:37.421
THE INITIATIVE. AND THAT BEING

00:47:37.487 --> 00:47:38.989
THE CHANGE WITH RESPECT TO THE

00:47:39.056 --> 00:47:40.724
PUBLIC NUISANCE LAW I KNOW

00:47:40.791 --> 00:47:41.692
THAT'S COME UP ALREADY AND

00:47:41.758 --> 00:47:43.227
THERE'S BEEN SOME DISCUSSION BY.

00:47:43.293 --> 00:47:45.629
MEMBERS AND ALSO BY THE ALEJO.

00:47:45.696 --> 00:47:47.364
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT.

00:47:47.431 --> 00:47:49.266
HAS BEEN THE UNDERSTANDING OF

00:47:49.333 --> 00:47:50.334
WHAT HAPPENED THE CASE I KNOW

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:51.735
THERE'S SOME DISAGREEMENT

00:47:51.802 --> 00:47:53.303
BECAUSE I'VE SEEN VARIOUS

00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:54.605
COMMENTATORS TALK ABOUT THE WAY

00:47:54.671 --> 00:47:55.072
THE DECISION IS BEING

00:47:55.138 --> 00:47:56.840
INTERPRETED.

00:47:56.907 --> 00:47:57.874
THERE'S A FEW THINGS THAT ARE

00:47:57.941 --> 00:47:59.576
UNDISPUTED ABOUT THE CASE AND

00:47:59.643 --> 00:48:01.345
THAT IS THE COURT DID FIND. THAT

00:48:01.411 --> 00:48:03.113
THERE IS A PUBLIC NUISANCE TO

00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:04.948
ADD THAT EXIST IN CALIFORNIA AND

00:48:05.015 --> 00:48:05.782
CERTAINLY THE TRIAL COURT

00:48:05.849 --> 00:48:07.951
DETERMINED. THAT IN CALIFORNIA

00:48:08.018 --> 00:48:10.053
IN THOSE TEN JURISDICTIONS

00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:11.588
BUT THE PRESENCE OF LEAD PAINT

00:48:11.655 --> 00:48:13.290
IN PRE NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE

00:48:13.357 --> 00:48:14.791
PROPERTIES THIS IS THE TRIAL

00:48:14.858 --> 00:48:16.426
COURT DECISION AT THE BEGINNING.

00:48:16.493 --> 00:48:18.161
THAT THOSE PROPERTIES.

00:48:18.228 --> 00:48:20.163
HAD A PUBLIC NUISANCE.

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:21.965
AND NOT RELATED TO THE PRESENCE

00:48:22.032 --> 00:48:23.867
OF CERTAIN LEAD PAINT IN THOSE

00:48:23.934 --> 00:48:25.535
PROPERTIES NOT ALL LEAD PAINT IN

00:48:25.602 --> 00:48:26.970
THOSE PROPERTIES.

00:48:27.037 --> 00:48:28.238
CERTAIN SURFACES IN THOSE

00:48:28.305 --> 00:48:29.740
PROPERTIES AND DESIGNED AND

00:48:29.806 --> 00:48:31.375
ABATEMENT PROGRAM FOR THOSE

00:48:31.441 --> 00:48:33.243
PROPERTIES.

00:48:33.310 --> 00:48:34.811
IT ALSO FOUND THAT THESE THREE

00:48:34.878 --> 00:48:36.713
COMPANIES THAT WAR TARGETED IN

00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:38.482
THAT LAWSUIT.

00:48:38.548 --> 00:48:39.583
WE'RE LIABLE FOR CREATING THAT

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:41.285
NUISANCE

00:48:41.351 --> 00:48:43.353
BECAUSE OF PROMOTING THE SALE OF

00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:44.187
ITS PRODUCTS IN THE EARLY PART

00:48:44.254 --> 00:48:45.956
OF THE LAST CENTURY.

00:48:46.023 --> 00:48:47.858
SO IT TO FIND THAT THERE WAS A

00:48:47.924 --> 00:48:49.559
NUISANCE THAT EXISTED IT SAYS

00:48:49.626 --> 00:48:51.561
THESE PARTIES WERE RESPONSIBLE

00:48:51.628 --> 00:48:53.363
FOR CREATING IT. AND CREATED A

00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:55.699
SPECIFIC ABATEMENT PROGRAM FOR

00:48:55.766 --> 00:48:57.334
INDIVIDUAL PROPERTIES.

00:48:57.401 --> 00:48:58.935
SO WE MAY GET INTO SOME

00:48:59.002 --> 00:49:00.604
SEMANTICS GAMES

00:49:00.671 --> 00:49:02.572
WITH RESPECT TO HOW THE ORDER

00:49:02.639 --> 00:49:05.008
WAS OF WHAT THE COURT DECIDED.

00:49:05.075 --> 00:49:05.609
BUT THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT

00:49:05.676 --> 00:49:07.477
THE.

00:49:07.544 --> 00:49:09.179
SCISSION REQUIRES THAT

00:49:09.246 --> 00:49:10.580
INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY OWNERS

00:49:10.647 --> 00:49:12.282
EITHER.

00:49:12.349 --> 00:49:13.750
IN ROLL INTO AN ABATEMENT

00:49:13.817 --> 00:49:15.786
PROGRAM OR NOT.

00:49:15.852 --> 00:49:16.620
AND THAT THEY WILL EITHER BE

00:49:16.687 --> 00:49:18.355
LISTED.

00:49:18.422 --> 00:49:20.057
I'M ON A ROLL OF WHETHER THEY IN.

00:49:20.123 --> 00:49:21.958
ENROLLED FOR THE ABATEMENT

00:49:22.025 --> 00:49:23.727
PROGRAM OR NOT AND THEN

00:49:23.794 --> 00:49:24.695
ULTIMATELY WHETHER THEY'RE

00:49:24.761 --> 00:49:26.063
INSPECTED AND WHETHER THEY HAVE

00:49:26.129 --> 00:49:28.031
LED SERVICES IN THEIR HOMES.

00:49:28.098 --> 00:49:29.366
THAT'S THIS THAT WAY THAT

00:49:29.433 --> 00:49:32.602
SCISSION WAS MADE BY THE COURT

00:49:32.669 --> 00:49:33.603
WAS TO USE THE PUBLIC NUISANCE

00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:35.672
LAWS IN CALIFORNIA. TO SAY THAT

00:49:35.739 --> 00:49:38.675
LEAD PAINT IN THOSE HOMES.

00:49:38.742 --> 00:49:40.677
INTERFERED WITH THE PUBLIC RIGHT.

00:49:40.744 --> 00:49:42.446
SO THAT ALL THE PROPERTIES IN

00:49:42.512 --> 00:49:44.181
THAT GROUP OF PROPERTIES

00:49:44.247 --> 00:49:45.182
TRIBUTE IT FOR THE CREATION OF A

00:49:45.248 --> 00:49:46.883
PUBLIC NUISANCE.

00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:47.984
IN ORDER TO REMEDY THAT PUBLIC

00:49:48.051 --> 00:49:49.653
NUISANCE

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:51.655
THE COURT SAID YOU HAD TO ABATE.

00:49:51.722 --> 00:49:52.789
THOSE PROPERTIES TO GET RID OF

00:49:52.856 --> 00:49:54.324
THAT NUISANCE IF YOU DIDN'T GET

00:49:54.391 --> 00:49:56.093
RID OF THE SURFACE IS IDENTIFIED

00:49:56.159 --> 00:49:57.861
BY THE COURT.

00:49:57.928 --> 00:49:59.563
YOU COULD OBEY TO THE PROBLEM

00:49:59.629 --> 00:50:00.464
BEING THAT BEING THE DECISION OF

00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:02.032
THE COURT.

00:50:02.099 --> 00:50:03.600
SO WHAT IS THE USE OF THE PUBLIC

00:50:03.667 --> 00:50:05.702
NUISANCE LAW THAT REALLY DEFINES

00:50:05.769 --> 00:50:07.671
THE OBLIGATIONS OF PARTIES

00:50:07.738 --> 00:50:08.038
I WILL SAY AND.

00:50:08.105 --> 00:50:09.606
.

00:50:09.673 --> 00:50:10.474
ASSEMBLYMEMBER STONE I DON'T

00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:12.242
WANNA VEER AND OTHER THINGS THE

00:50:12.309 --> 00:50:13.677
LEGISLATURE HAS DONE IN THE PAST

00:50:13.744 --> 00:50:15.011
BUT IT IS IMPORTANT LEAST TO

00:50:15.078 --> 00:50:16.113
REFERENCE THE LAWS THAT THE

00:50:16.179 --> 00:50:17.514
COURT USE.

00:50:17.581 --> 00:50:18.682
BECAUSE IT AFFECTS THE WAY THE

00:50:18.749 --> 00:50:21.218
IT THE INITIATIVE WILL AFFECT

00:50:21.284 --> 00:50:23.587
THE OTHER LAWS IN CALIFORNIA.

00:50:23.653 --> 00:50:26.223
NEVER BEFORE DID THE COURTS.

00:50:26.289 --> 00:50:27.958
NOR THIS LEGISLATURE HAVE TO

00:50:28.024 --> 00:50:29.326
LOOK AT THE USE OF PUBLIC

00:50:29.393 --> 00:50:30.360
NUISANCE LAW.

00:50:30.427 --> 00:50:32.162
TO LOOK AT.

00:50:32.229 --> 00:50:34.297
THE IMPACT OF LEAD AN INDIVIDUAL

00:50:34.364 --> 00:50:37.000
HOMES INSTEAD THE LEGISLATURE.

00:50:37.067 --> 00:50:39.436
IN EVERY COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA.

00:50:39.503 --> 00:50:41.405
USE THE LOSS TO SAY YOU CANNOT

00:50:41.471 --> 00:50:43.673
HAVE A LEAD HAZARD. IN A

00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:44.908
RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY.

00:50:44.975 --> 00:50:46.743
PERIOD

00:50:46.810 --> 00:50:48.645
CHILDREN CANNOT UNDER THE LAW

00:50:48.712 --> 00:50:50.347
RIGHT NOW BE EXPOSED TO A LEAD

00:50:50.414 --> 00:50:51.948
HAZARD AND PROPERTIES.

00:50:52.015 --> 00:50:52.783
BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN LEGISLATED

00:50:52.849 --> 00:50:54.484
AGAINST

00:50:54.551 --> 00:50:56.119
AND HAS TO BE INSPECTED AND

00:50:56.186 --> 00:50:58.789
ENFORCED BY THE LOCAL OFFICIALS.

00:50:58.855 --> 00:51:00.524
INSTEAD HERE.

00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:02.726
TO CHANGE THE LAW.

00:51:02.793 --> 00:51:03.760
THE COURT SAID THAT THE

00:51:03.827 --> 00:51:04.761
LEGISLATURE HAD NOT GONE FAR

00:51:04.828 --> 00:51:07.164
ENOUGH.

00:51:07.230 --> 00:51:08.031
IN THAT THE LEGISLATURE NEEDED

00:51:08.098 --> 00:51:09.499
THAT.

00:51:09.566 --> 00:51:11.234
INSTEAD THE COURT WAS IN APPLY

00:51:11.301 --> 00:51:12.636
PUBLIC NUISANCE LAW TO SAY

00:51:12.702 --> 00:51:14.838
HOWEVER YOU DEFINE IT.

00:51:14.905 --> 00:51:16.206
I DISAGREE AND SAY THAT EACH

00:51:16.273 --> 00:51:17.541
INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY WAS DEFINED

00:51:17.607 --> 00:51:19.209
A PUBLIC NUISANCE BUT THE COURT

00:51:19.276 --> 00:51:20.710
SAID THAT ALL PRE NINETEEN

00:51:20.777 --> 00:51:22.412
EIGHTY ONE HOMES WERE PART OF

00:51:22.479 --> 00:51:23.547
THE GROUP OF PROPERTIES THAT

00:51:23.613 --> 00:51:24.981
WERE CONSIDERED.

00:51:25.048 --> 00:51:26.516
A PUBLIC NUISANCE AND WILL USE

00:51:26.583 --> 00:51:27.117
THAT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS

00:51:27.184 --> 00:51:28.552
HEARING.

00:51:28.618 --> 00:51:30.253
THE APPELLATE COURT THEN SAID.

00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:32.189
THAT THESE COMPANIES COULD NOT

00:51:32.255 --> 00:51:34.624
IN ANY WAY BE HELD LIABLE FOR

00:51:34.691 --> 00:51:35.525
ANY PROPERTIES AFTER NINETEEN

00:51:35.592 --> 00:51:37.994
FIFTY.

00:51:38.061 --> 00:51:39.463
THE APPELLATE COURT DID NOT SAY

00:51:39.529 --> 00:51:41.698
THAT A NUISANCE DID NOT EXIST.

00:51:41.765 --> 00:51:42.432
AND POST NINETEEN FIFTY

00:51:42.499 --> 00:51:43.867
PROPERTIES

00:51:43.934 --> 00:51:45.702
SO THOSE POSTS NINETEEN FIFTY

00:51:45.769 --> 00:51:47.037
PROPERTIES DO NOT HAVE AN

00:51:47.103 --> 00:51:49.606
ABATEMENT PROGRAM.

00:51:49.673 --> 00:51:50.740
THERE IS NO FUNDED DEBATE CAN

00:51:50.807 --> 00:51:52.075
PROGRAM THAT IS CREATED BY THE

00:51:52.142 --> 00:51:53.677
COURTS FOR POST NINETEEN FIFTY

00:51:53.743 --> 00:51:55.545
PROPERTIES.

00:51:55.612 --> 00:51:57.747
YET THE DESIGNATION.

00:51:57.814 --> 00:51:59.583
OF A PUBLIC NUISANCE EXISTING IN

00:51:59.649 --> 00:52:01.718
THOSE PROPERTIES SURVIVES

00:52:01.785 --> 00:52:02.853
WOULD THE COURT HAD DETERMINED

00:52:02.919 --> 00:52:04.855
IN THE TRIAL COURT.

00:52:04.921 --> 00:52:05.522
ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE

00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:06.756
APPELLATE COURT AND THEN IS

00:52:06.823 --> 00:52:08.325
UPHELD BY.

00:52:08.391 --> 00:52:10.093
SUPREME COURT OF CALIFORNIA

00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:12.395
NO JUST PROCEDURALLY SO I'M SURE

00:52:12.462 --> 00:52:13.497
THAT YOU ALL KNOW THAT LEASE THE

00:52:13.563 --> 00:52:14.998
INTENTION OF THE COMPANIES. HAS

00:52:15.065 --> 00:52:17.467
MEANT TO APPEAL THE CASE TO THE

00:52:17.534 --> 00:52:19.135
U. S. SUPREME COURT AND SEEKS

00:52:19.202 --> 00:52:21.738
OUT A. FILE A PETITION FOR CERT

00:52:21.805 --> 00:52:22.873
SUPREME COURT THAT'LL HAPPEN

00:52:22.939 --> 00:52:24.808
SOMETIMES LATER AND I KNOW THAT

00:52:24.875 --> 00:52:26.376
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT SOME POINT

00:52:26.443 --> 00:52:27.143
BECAUSE IT RELATES TO THE

00:52:27.210 --> 00:52:29.346
INITIATIVE. THAT NL INDUSTRIES

00:52:29.412 --> 00:52:31.248
HAS RECENTLY SETTLED. I'M THE

00:52:31.314 --> 00:52:32.949
CASE FOR SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS

00:52:33.016 --> 00:52:34.818
WITH ABOUT THIRTY THREE PERCENT

00:52:34.885 --> 00:52:35.619
OF THAT GOING TO THE TRIAL

00:52:35.685 --> 00:52:37.554
LAWYERS. AYE AND THE CASE SO

00:52:37.621 --> 00:52:39.389
I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT THAT HAS AN

00:52:39.456 --> 00:52:40.957
IMPACT ON THE INITIATIVE SINCE I.

00:52:41.024 --> 00:52:42.459
I I THINK YOU KNOW THEY ARE

00:52:42.526 --> 00:52:43.927
LISTED AS PART OF THE INITIATIVE

00:52:43.994 --> 00:52:46.630
THEY'VE ALSO SETTLED THE CASE.

00:52:46.696 --> 00:52:48.431
I SAY THOSE THREE THINGS WITH

00:52:48.498 --> 00:52:49.866
REGARD TO THE CASE

00:52:49.933 --> 00:52:51.902
WITH REGARD TO THE EXISTENCE OF

00:52:51.968 --> 00:52:54.070
A NUISANCE IN A BOTH CATEGORIES

00:52:54.137 --> 00:52:55.639
A PROPERTY'S PRE NINETEEN FIFTY.

00:52:55.705 --> 00:52:57.340
AND NINETEEN EIGHTY TO HIGHLIGHT

00:52:57.407 --> 00:52:59.342
THE FACT OF ONE THING THAT WE'VE

00:52:59.409 --> 00:53:01.311
BEEN SAYING PERSISTENTLY WITH

00:53:01.378 --> 00:53:03.113
REGARD TO THE INITIATIVE.

00:53:03.179 --> 00:53:04.080
AND THAT RELATES TO THE FACT

00:53:04.147 --> 00:53:06.082
THAT THERE IS MEANING TO THE

00:53:06.149 --> 00:53:07.150
WORDS OF FINDING A PUBLIC

00:53:07.217 --> 00:53:09.052
NUISANCE.

00:53:09.119 --> 00:53:10.554
I HAVE OTHER WITNESSES HERE

00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:11.955
TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK A

00:53:12.022 --> 00:53:13.390
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT BUT I WANT

00:53:13.456 --> 00:53:15.392
TO PUT THAT IN CONTEXT IN TERMS

00:53:15.458 --> 00:53:17.193
OF POLICY MAKING.

00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:18.895
AND THAT IS IN TERMS OF

00:53:18.962 --> 00:53:20.664
SOMETHING WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT

00:53:20.730 --> 00:53:22.065
THE COURT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN

00:53:22.132 --> 00:53:23.767
THE ROLE OF TRYING TO DEFINE

00:53:23.833 --> 00:53:25.535
WHAT THE RELATIONSHIP SHOULD BE.

00:53:25.602 --> 00:53:27.504
IN TERMS OF PROPERTY OWNERS

00:53:27.571 --> 00:53:28.772
HAVING OBLIGATIONS ON THE PUBLIC

00:53:28.838 --> 00:53:30.941
NUISANCE LAW AS OPPOSED TO WHAT

00:53:31.007 --> 00:53:32.642
THE LEGISLATURE AND INTENDED IN

00:53:32.709 --> 00:53:34.177
TERMS OF HAVING OBLIGATIONS ON

PROPERTY OWNERS. AND ALSO THE

00:53:35.912 --> 00:53:37.047
INTENTION TO HOLD THESE

00:53:37.113 --> 00:53:39.015
MANUFACTURERS LIABLE UNDER A

00:53:39.082 --> 00:53:40.517
LEGISLATIVE SCHEME THAT WAS

00:53:40.584 --> 00:53:41.151
CREATED BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY

00:53:41.217 --> 00:53:42.385

BECAUSE OF THAT THEY'RE FINDING

00:53:57.100 --> 00:53:59.002
THAT A NUISANCE MAY EXIST ON THE

00:53:59.069 --> 00:54:00.604
PROPERTY BECAUSE OF THE

00:54:00.670 --> 00:54:01.571

ATTENDED BY THE ORIGINAL.

00:55:04.334 --> 00:55:04.868
COMPANIES WHEN THEY WROTE THE

00:55:04.934 --> 00:55:05.669
POLICIES.

00:55:05.735 --> 00:55:07.303
AND THEY INVOLVE MULTIPLE POLICY

00:55:07.370 --> 00:55:07.504
YEARS.

00:55:07.570 --> 00:55:09.172
.

00:55:09.239 --> 00:55:10.373
OF THE MONTROSE DECISION IN

00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:12.108
CALIFORNIA WAS INVOLVING LIKED

00:55:12.175 --> 00:55:13.176
HIM YEARS OF.

00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:15.445
YOU KNOW HOW A DIFFERENT

00:55:15.512 --> 00:55:17.681
POLICIES AND HOW IT WOULD APPLY

00:55:17.747 --> 00:55:19.115
BOTH PRIMARY NEXUS LIABILITY.

00:55:19.182 --> 00:55:20.450
SO ANYWAY I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN

00:55:20.517 --> 00:55:22.452
A LOT OF THAT ALSO A DRAFT DID

00:55:22.519 --> 00:55:25.422
WRITTEN POLICIES OR. ACTUALLY.

00:55:25.488 --> 00:55:28.158
AND MINISTER TEAMS OF DIVERS SO.

00:55:28.224 --> 00:55:29.626
ONE MAJOR POLICY THAT WAS A

00:55:29.693 --> 00:55:30.994
WRITTEN BY ONE OF THE A IG

00:55:31.061 --> 00:55:33.229
COMPANIES. AND ALSO DID IT FOR A

00:55:33.296 --> 00:55:34.964
ON THE THE LARGEST.

00:55:35.031 --> 00:55:37.300
BROKER THE WORLD SO I'VE A LOT

00:55:37.367 --> 00:55:38.768
OF EXPERIENCE IN THIS.

00:55:38.835 --> 00:55:38.968
AND.

00:55:39.035 --> 00:55:41.237
WHEN I BEGAN TO.

00:55:41.304 --> 00:55:43.640
LOOK AT THIS AND TRY TO GAUGE

00:55:43.707 --> 00:55:44.808
THE IMPLICATIONS OF.

00:55:44.874 --> 00:55:46.676
PUBLIC NUISANCE.

00:55:46.743 --> 00:55:47.911
ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS AS AN

00:55:47.977 --> 00:55:49.612
INSURANCE PERSON I WOULD BE

00:55:49.679 --> 00:55:52.849
THINKING ABOUT IS HOW. THAT WORD.

00:55:52.916 --> 00:55:54.250
AS CLUB THING THEY WOULD DO A

00:55:54.317 --> 00:55:56.319
COVER UNDER A LIABILITY POLICY

00:55:56.386 --> 00:55:58.421
WITH ACTUALLY TO HAPPEN BECAUSE

00:55:58.488 --> 00:55:59.622
IT'S SORT OF LIKE A TRANSFER.

00:55:59.689 --> 00:56:01.291
FROM MAYBE PRODUCT LIABILITY

00:56:01.357 --> 00:56:03.026
INTO SORT A PUBLIC NUISANCE

00:56:03.093 --> 00:56:05.361
AND ALSO IT OPENS UP A WHOLE NEW.

00:56:05.428 --> 00:56:07.097
YOU KNOW AREA.

00:56:07.163 --> 00:56:08.732
SPECIFICALLY AS REGARDS.

00:56:08.798 --> 00:56:11.534
FIELD WITH THE LID PAIN ISSUES

00:56:11.601 --> 00:56:12.969
IN THE INITIATIVE IN CALIFORNIA.

00:56:13.036 --> 00:56:14.904
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK

00:56:14.971 --> 00:56:16.673
THE CASE UNSOLVED AT THIS

00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:18.074
PARTICULAR POINT IF I CAN USE

00:56:18.141 --> 00:56:19.576
THAT TERMINOLOGY DOES.

00:56:19.642 --> 00:56:21.611
IS IT CREATES A AN AWFUL LOT OF

00:56:21.678 --> 00:56:23.713
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IN

00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:25.281
VARIOUS PARTS OF THE. INSURANCE

00:56:25.348 --> 00:56:26.783
BUSINESS

00:56:26.850 --> 00:56:28.585
NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IS THE

00:56:28.651 --> 00:56:30.553
HOMER HIMSELF BECAUSE.

00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:32.088
UNDOUBTEDLY THERE WILL BE A

00:56:32.155 --> 00:56:33.623
PUBLIC NUISANCE EXCLUSIONS OF

00:56:33.690 --> 00:56:35.058
ALL POP UP ON THESE POLICIES

00:56:35.125 --> 00:56:36.493
BOTH FOR.

00:56:36.559 --> 00:56:38.661
FIRST PARTY CLAIMS FOR YOU KNOW

00:56:38.728 --> 00:56:39.996
THE PROPERTY ITSELF BUT ALSO FOR

00:56:40.063 --> 00:56:42.699
OF LIABILITY COVERAGE AS WELL.

00:56:42.766 --> 00:56:44.267
BUT THAT'S NOT THE PART THE

00:56:44.334 --> 00:56:45.835
WHOLE POINT OF THE STORY BECAUSE

00:56:45.902 --> 00:56:47.904
IT GOES WAY BEYOND THAT.

00:56:47.971 --> 00:56:48.705
ONE OF THE BIG THINGS IS

00:56:48.772 --> 00:56:50.073
HAPPENING CALIFORNIA AND

00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:51.975
LANDLORDS TODAY IS THE ISSUE OF

00:56:52.041 --> 00:56:53.610

PROPERTIES SO IF YOUR LANDLORD.

IN YOUR GUT DESCRIBES A PUBLIC

00:56:58.181 --> 00:56:59.182
NUISANCE.

00:56:59.249 --> 00:57:00.416
CHANCES ARE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO

00:57:00.483 --> 00:57:02.152
BE ABLE TO COLLECT RENT OR LEASE

00:57:02.218 --> 00:57:03.987
YOU MAY HAVE TO GIVE BACK RENT

00:57:04.053 --> 00:57:04.587
FOR THE LAST YEAR OR SOMETHING

00:57:04.654 --> 00:57:06.489
LIKE THAT WHICH. COULD BE A GOOD

00:57:06.556 --> 00:57:07.457
THING IN THAT PROPERTIES ARE

00:57:07.524 --> 00:57:08.625
BEING CLEANED UP IT IS CERTAINLY

00:57:08.691 --> 00:57:10.393
A. TREMENDOUS RISK.

00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:12.529
PRIOR TO NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT IN

00:57:12.595 --> 00:57:13.963
CALIFORNIA AND ACTUALLY THE

00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:14.798
ENTIRE COUNTRY.

00:57:14.864 --> 00:57:15.799
.

00:57:15.865 --> 00:57:17.901
HUG.

00:57:17.967 --> 00:57:19.669
THERE WAS REALLY EXPLOSION SIX

00:57:19.736 --> 00:57:21.805
POSTED REDLINING ON THE ON THE

00:57:21.871 --> 00:57:23.339
ISSUING OF LOANS AND SO FORTH.

00:57:23.406 --> 00:57:25.975
AND THE FAIR HOUSING ACT OF

00:57:26.042 --> 00:57:27.577
NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT SOLVE BAD.

00:57:27.644 --> 00:57:29.179
IF FOR THE MOST PART WE REALLY

00:57:29.245 --> 00:57:31.481
HAVEN'T HAD REDLINING. INSURANCE

00:57:31.548 --> 00:57:32.248

00:57:32.315 --> 00:57:33.917
ABOVE AND PROMPTED BY THE

00:57:33.983 --> 00:57:35.218
DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE ARE VERY

00:57:35.285 --> 00:57:37.220
SENSITIVE. ABOUT ANYTHING THAT

00:57:37.287 --> 00:57:38.788
MIGHT HAVE TO DO WITH RED LIGHT

00:57:38.855 --> 00:57:41.257
HOWEVER. THIS HUGE ISSUE OF WHAT

00:57:41.324 --> 00:57:42.926
IS PUBLIC NUISANCE AND HOW THAT

00:57:42.992 --> 00:57:45.829

OTHER THINGS IS A IS A REAL. A

00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:48.865
REAL PROBLEM FOR THE INDUSTRY

00:57:48.932 --> 00:57:50.433
AND I THINK WHAT'S GOING TO BE

00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:51.901
HAPPENING. IS THAT THE

00:57:51.968 --> 00:57:54.404

01:03:19.362 --> 01:03:21.664
THAT THERE ARE LOCAL OBLIGATIONS

01:03:21.731 --> 01:03:23.533

TO BE LABEL EIGHTY A NUISANCE.

THAT I FOUND THAT INTERESTING

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:13.049
IN READING THE CASE IN FOLLOWING

01:04:13.115 --> 01:04:14.517

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:06.969
AND I THINK FINALLY IT IS THE

01:05:07.036 --> 01:05:08.871
ISSUE OF FAILING TO RECOGNIZE

01:05:08.938 --> 01:05:11.374
THAT.

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:12.942

01:05:23.286 --> 01:05:25.288
THEN YOU RUN INTO A SERIOUS

01:05:25.354 --> 01:05:27.156
HOUSING CRISIS.

AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I KNOW THE

01:05:35.731 --> 01:05:38.200
DEFINITION OF AFFORDABILITY IS

01:05:38.267 --> 01:05:40.436
DIFFERENT IN EACH JURISDICTION.

01:05:40.503 --> 01:05:42.104
BUT IN I THINK IN THIS CASE IN

01:05:42.171 --> 01:05:44.240

LEGISLATURE.

01:05:56.886 --> 01:06:00.222

FLINT MICHIGAN.

01:09:57.793 --> 01:10:00.996
HE RECOGNIZED THAT WE KNOW NOW

01:10:01.063 --> 01:10:03.065
WHAT WE DID NOT KNOW THAT.

01:10:03.132 --> 01:10:04.833
ABOUT PROBLEMS FOR CHILDREN FROM

01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:06.302
EXPOSURE TO LEAD AND MOST

01:10:06.368 --> 01:10:08.804
IMPORTANTLY HE URGED.

01:10:08.871 --> 01:10:10.472
THE PEOPLE OF THAT COMMUNITY TO

01:10:10.539 --> 01:10:12.841
AVOID ATTACHING A STIGMA.

01:10:12.908 --> 01:10:14.410
TO THE CHILDREN OF FLINT BACK

01:10:14.476 --> 01:10:16.045
PAY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE PROBLEMS

01:10:16.111 --> 01:10:16.879
FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES

01:10:16.946 --> 01:10:18.647
BECAUSE OF FLAT.

01:10:18.714 --> 01:10:19.748
AND I'LL QUOTE HIM HERE HE SAYS.

01:10:19.815 --> 01:10:22.017
BUT.

01:10:22.084 --> 01:10:23.886
AND THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT SO

01:10:23.953 --> 01:10:24.386
I WANT EVERYBODY TO PAY

01:10:24.453 --> 01:10:26.155
ATTENTION.

01:10:26.221 --> 01:10:27.723
IF YOU KNOW THAT YOUR CHILD MAY

01:10:27.790 --> 01:10:29.325
HAVE BEEN EXPOSED AND YOU HAVE

01:10:29.391 --> 01:10:31.293
AND YOU GO TO A HEALTH CLINIC. A

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:33.295
DOCTOR A PROVIDER.

01:10:33.362 --> 01:10:35.097
AND ARE WORKING WITH THEM THEN

01:10:35.164 --> 01:10:37.066
YOUR CHILD WILL BE FINE. AND THE

01:10:37.132 --> 01:10:38.033
REASON I CAN SAY THAT WITH SOME

01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:39.501
CONFIDENCE

01:10:39.568 --> 01:10:41.737
IS THAT JUST BASED ON SCIENCE

01:10:41.804 --> 01:10:44.306
BUT. BUT BASED ON THE FACT THAT

01:10:44.373 --> 01:10:46.542
THAT HEAP IN MIND THAT IT WASN'T

01:10:46.609 --> 01:10:48.143
UNTIL THE EIGHTIES WHERE WE

01:10:48.210 --> 01:10:50.546
STARTED BANNING LEAD IN PAINT.

01:10:50.613 --> 01:10:53.482
LET IN TOYS LEADING GASOLINE SO

01:10:53.549 --> 01:10:55.217
IF YOU ARE MY AGE OR OLDER OR

01:10:55.284 --> 01:10:56.919
MAYBE EVEN A LITTLE BIT YOUNGER

01:10:56.986 --> 01:10:59.588
YOU GOT SOME LEAD IN YOUR SYSTEM.

01:10:59.655 --> 01:11:00.656
WHEN YOU WERE GROWING UP.

01:11:00.723 --> 01:11:02.658
YOU DID.

01:11:02.725 --> 01:11:05.294
I AM SURE THAT SOMEWHERE.

01:11:05.361 --> 01:11:06.996
WHEN I WAS TWO YEARS OLD I WAS

01:11:07.062 --> 01:11:09.632
TAKING A CHIP THE PAINT.

01:11:09.698 --> 01:11:12.001
TASTING AT AND I GOT SOME LEAD.

01:11:12.067 --> 01:11:12.901
OR SOMETIMES TOYS WERE PAINTED

01:11:12.968 --> 01:11:14.103
WITH LEAD.

01:11:14.169 --> 01:11:16.071
AND YOU WERE CHEWING ON THEM.

01:11:16.138 --> 01:11:18.307
NOW I SAY THAT NOT TO MAKE LIGHT

01:11:18.374 --> 01:11:21.343
OF THE SITUATION. WE KNOW NOW E

01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:23.078
WHAT WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT. WHICH

01:11:23.145 --> 01:11:24.680
IS IT CAN CAUSE PROBLEMS IF

01:11:24.747 --> 01:11:26.815
CHILDREN GET EXPOSED TO LEAD AND

01:11:26.882 --> 01:11:28.617
AL AT ELEVATED LEVELS.

01:11:28.684 --> 01:11:30.419
BUT THE POINT IS THAT AS LONG AS

01:11:30.486 --> 01:11:31.754
KIDS ARE GETTING GOOD HEALTH

01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:32.454
CARE AND FOLKS ARE PAYING

01:11:32.521 --> 01:11:33.856
ATTENTION.

01:11:33.922 --> 01:11:35.391
AND THEY'RE GETTING A GOOD

01:11:35.457 --> 01:11:36.058
EDUCATION AND THEY HAVE

01:11:36.125 --> 01:11:38.093
COMMUNITY SUPPORT.

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:40.229
AND THEY'RE GETTING SOME GOOD

01:11:40.295 --> 01:11:41.597
HOME TRAINING AND THEY ARE IN

01:11:41.664 --> 01:11:43.165
THE COMMUNITY THAT IS LOVING AND

01:11:43.232 --> 01:11:45.034
NURTURING. AND THRIVING THESE

01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:46.869
KIDS WILL BE FINE.

01:11:46.935 --> 01:11:48.037
AND I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO

01:11:48.103 --> 01:11:49.905
START THINKING THAT SOMEHOW ALL

01:11:49.972 --> 01:11:51.040
THE KIDS IN FRONT ARE GOING TO

01:11:51.106 --> 01:11:53.175
HAVE PROBLEMS. FOR THE REST OF

01:11:53.242 --> 01:11:53.776
THEIR LIVES BECAUSE THAT'S NOT

01:11:53.842 --> 01:11:55.444
TRUE.

01:11:55.511 --> 01:11:57.846
THAT IS NOT TRUE AND I DON'T

01:11:57.913 --> 01:11:59.214
WANT THAT STIGMA TO BE

01:11:59.281 --> 01:12:02.051
ESTABLISHED IN THE MINDS OF KIDS.

01:12:02.117 --> 01:12:03.185
SO I HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT THE

01:12:03.252 --> 01:12:05.521
COURT HERE WAS TRYING TO DO GOOD

01:12:05.587 --> 01:12:06.055
THINGS FOR THE CHILDREN OF

01:12:06.121 --> 01:12:07.990
CALIFORNIA.

01:12:08.057 --> 01:12:10.325
BUT COURTS OFTEN LACK THE TOOLS.

01:12:10.392 --> 01:12:12.294
AND RESOURCES TO REACH RESULTS

01:12:12.361 --> 01:12:14.296
THAT ARE PRINCIPLED.

01:12:14.363 --> 01:12:15.264
RATIONAL AND BASED ON REASON

01:12:15.330 --> 01:12:16.999
DISTINCTIONS.

01:12:17.066 --> 01:12:19.234
THAT'S WHY.

01:12:19.301 --> 01:12:20.436
THERE ARE SO MANY BAD

01:12:20.502 --> 01:12:21.470
CONSEQUENCES OF THIS POSITION

01:12:21.537 --> 01:12:23.205
DECISION.

01:12:23.272 --> 01:12:24.440
TO ENSURE GOOD PUBLIC POLICY IN

01:12:24.506 --> 01:12:26.175
THE AREA THE HEALTH AND SAFETY

01:12:26.241 --> 01:12:27.543
OF HOUSING THE LEGISLATURE

01:12:27.609 --> 01:12:29.278
SHOULD DECIDE THE POLICY AND THE

01:12:29.344 --> 01:12:30.646
COURTS TO PIETY.

01:12:30.713 --> 01:12:32.948
I URGE YOU THE LEGISLATURE TO

01:12:33.015 --> 01:12:34.583
REMEDY THE PACKED BAD POLICY

01:12:34.650 --> 01:12:36.351
CREATED BY THIS COURT DECISION.

01:12:36.418 --> 01:12:37.586
AND IF MORE WORK IS NEEDED TO

01:12:37.653 --> 01:12:38.954
REMEDY THE ISSUE OF LEADING

01:12:39.021 --> 01:12:41.857
HOUSING. LOOK AT THE DATA.

01:12:41.924 --> 01:12:43.859
LOOK AT THE PROBLEM AREAS.

01:12:43.926 --> 01:12:45.127
AND COME TO A PRINCIPLED

01:12:45.194 --> 01:12:46.395
RATIONAL AND REASONS A REASON

01:12:46.462 --> 01:12:48.097
SOLUTION.

01:12:48.163 --> 01:12:48.964
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE

01:12:49.031 --> 01:12:51.166
TODAY THANK YOU.

01:12:51.233 --> 01:12:51.834
THANK YOU FOR THAT PRESENTATION.

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:54.670
.

01:12:54.737 --> 01:12:55.304
WHAT'S ABSOLUTELY ASTONISHING TO

01:12:55.370 --> 01:12:57.806
ME.

01:12:57.873 --> 01:13:00.375
OPPONENTS OF THE BALLOT MEASURE

01:13:00.442 --> 01:13:02.077
ARE ACTUALLY MAKING THE BEST

01:13:02.144 --> 01:13:02.644
ARGUMENT AGAINST THE BALLOT

01:13:02.711 --> 01:13:03.645
MEASURE.

01:13:03.712 --> 01:13:05.948
BECAUSE.

01:13:06.014 --> 01:13:07.349
YOU SAID THAT THAT THAT THE

01:13:07.416 --> 01:13:08.884
COURT DECISION IS BAD PUBLIC

01:13:08.951 --> 01:13:10.018
POLICY AND I THINK THERE ARE

01:13:10.085 --> 01:13:11.987
SOME CHALLENGES AND THAT.

01:13:12.054 --> 01:13:13.789
ALTHOUGH ON THE ISSUE OF.

01:13:13.856 --> 01:13:15.491
THENUISANCE THE COURT TRIED TO

01:13:15.557 --> 01:13:16.992
BE VERY VERY CLEAR IT'S NOT THE

01:13:17.059 --> 01:13:18.260
INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY THAT'S THE

01:13:18.327 --> 01:13:19.261
NUISANCE IS THE FACT THAT

01:13:19.328 --> 01:13:19.995
THERE'S LEAD IN CALIFORNIA

01:13:20.062 --> 01:13:21.697
THAT'S THE NUISANCE.

01:13:21.764 --> 01:13:22.698
AND THEY TRIED TO DRAW THE

01:13:22.765 --> 01:13:24.099
DISTINCTION.

01:13:24.166 --> 01:13:26.335
AND TRIED TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT

01:13:26.401 --> 01:13:28.537
THAT THEY SHOULD NOT IMPOSE AN

01:13:28.604 --> 01:13:30.439
OBLIGATION ON. AN INDIVIDUAL

01:13:30.506 --> 01:13:31.573
PROPERTY OWNER TO COME FORWARD

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:33.609
IT SHOULD NOT LEAD TO A RED TAG

01:13:33.675 --> 01:13:34.977
OF A PROPER THAT THAT IT'S

01:13:35.043 --> 01:13:36.879
INTENDED TO BE VOLUNTARY.

01:13:36.945 --> 01:13:38.447
AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT'S

01:13:38.514 --> 01:13:39.548
UNCLEAR THAT IS SOMETHING THE

01:13:39.615 --> 01:13:40.215
LEGISLATURE SHOULD.

01:13:40.282 --> 01:13:42.151
TO DEAL WITH.

01:13:42.217 --> 01:13:43.252
BUT WE'RE FACED WITH A BALLOT

01:13:43.318 --> 01:13:44.987
MEASURE THAT TAKES.

01:13:45.053 --> 01:13:47.456
IN YOUR WORDS BAD POLICY.

01:13:47.523 --> 01:13:48.957
AND ADDS ON TOP OF IT EVEN WORSE

01:13:49.024 --> 01:13:50.726
POLICY.

01:13:50.793 --> 01:13:52.461
BECAUSE NOT ONLY ARE WE NOT

01:13:52.528 --> 01:13:54.263
SOLVING IN THIS BALLOT MEASURE

01:13:54.329 --> 01:13:56.331
THE NUISANCE ISSUE.

01:13:56.398 --> 01:13:57.466
BECAUSE WE'RE JUST GLOSSING OVER

01:13:57.533 --> 01:13:58.934
THE NUISANCE ISSUE WHICH I I

01:13:59.001 --> 01:13:59.802
WOULD AGREE THE LEGISLATURE

01:13:59.868 --> 01:14:01.503
SHOULD WEIGH IN ON.

01:14:01.570 --> 01:14:03.272
BUT WE'RE NOW TAKING.

01:14:03.338 --> 01:14:04.540
THE PERPETRATORS OF THE PROBLEM

01:14:04.606 --> 01:14:05.941
THE PAINT COMPANIES WHO THE

01:14:06.008 --> 01:14:08.310
COURTS FOUND CULPABLE.

01:14:08.377 --> 01:14:10.312
AND FOUND OBLIGED TO PAY.

01:14:10.379 --> 01:14:11.613
NOW IT'S GOING TO BE AND THE AND

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:13.182
I'M SURPRISED THAT.

01:14:13.248 --> 01:14:14.249
THE LAST TWO SPEAKERS ARE

01:14:14.316 --> 01:14:15.083
SUPPORTING THE BALLOT MEASURE

01:14:15.150 --> 01:14:16.351
BECAUSE INSTEAD OF THE

01:14:16.418 --> 01:14:17.586
PERPETRATORS.

01:14:17.653 --> 01:14:19.521
PAYING.

01:14:19.588 --> 01:14:20.389
THIS WILL BE THE PEOPLE OF THE

01:14:20.455 --> 01:14:21.557
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:14:21.623 --> 01:14:23.492
WHO WOULD HAVE TO BE PAY?

01:14:23.559 --> 01:14:24.927
SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THE

01:14:24.993 --> 01:14:26.795
SLUMLORDS GET FREE REMEDIATION.

01:14:26.862 --> 01:14:28.564
WHICH

01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:29.498
OKAY YOU COULD ARGUE THAT THAT'S

01:14:29.565 --> 01:14:31.300
THAT'S

01:14:31.366 --> 01:14:32.668
BUT EMOTIONAL TERM TO SAY THESE

01:14:32.734 --> 01:14:34.036
ARE SLUMLORDS.

01:14:34.102 --> 01:14:35.871
I WOULD ARGUE THAT.

01:14:35.938 --> 01:14:38.407
IF THERE'S LEAD PAINT IN ANY

01:14:38.473 --> 01:14:40.309
APARTMENT BUILDING WHETHER NOT

01:14:40.375 --> 01:14:42.110
THE SLUMLORD OR ANY HOUSING.

01:14:42.177 --> 01:14:43.512
WHETHER OR NOT IT'S A SLUM LORD

01:14:43.579 --> 01:14:44.913
OR OR IT OR A POOR WERE

01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:46.381
DIFFICULT AREA.

01:14:46.448 --> 01:14:49.251
THAT THAT FAMILY HAS.

01:14:49.318 --> 01:14:50.853
HAS EVERY RIGHT TO HAVE THAT

01:14:50.919 --> 01:14:53.722
REMEDIATED NOT AT THEIR EXPENSE.

01:14:53.789 --> 01:14:54.623
AND SO IF THE COURT DECISION

01:14:54.690 --> 01:14:56.491
STANDS.

01:14:56.558 --> 01:14:58.927
AND WE NEED TO WAY IN ON THE

01:14:58.994 --> 01:15:00.162
ISSUE OF NEW SINCE ARE NOT

01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:01.330
NUISANCE OR SOLVE THAT.

01:15:01.396 --> 01:15:02.331
WHY THEN WITH THE PEOPLE

01:15:02.397 --> 01:15:04.199
CALIFORNIA?

01:15:04.266 --> 01:15:06.134
BE THE ONES OBLIGATED.

01:15:06.201 --> 01:15:07.569
TO COME UP WITH THE MONEY TO

01:15:07.636 --> 01:15:09.137
REMEDIATE AND BECAUSE THERE'S

01:15:09.204 --> 01:15:10.772
THAT PART OF REMEDIATION UNDER

01:15:10.839 --> 01:15:12.174
THIS FUNDED BY THAT BY

01:15:12.241 --> 01:15:14.076
CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS.

01:15:14.142 --> 01:15:15.544
THAT EXACT SITUATION THAT YOU

01:15:15.611 --> 01:15:18.046
DESCRIBED STILL EXISTS.

01:15:18.113 --> 01:15:18.914
SO THE BALLOT MEASURE SOLVES

01:15:18.981 --> 01:15:20.816
NOTHING.

01:15:20.883 --> 01:15:22.417
FROM FROM THE ISSUE THAT YOU

01:15:22.484 --> 01:15:24.186
ARTICULATE VERY WELL. AND THOSE

01:15:24.253 --> 01:15:25.187
WHO HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH

01:15:25.254 --> 01:15:26.955
HOUSING FOR A LONG TIME AND YET

01:15:27.022 --> 01:15:28.390
IT CREATES AN ADDITIONAL BURDEN

01:15:28.457 --> 01:15:30.926
AN OBLIGATION ON ALL CALIFORNIA

01:15:30.993 --> 01:15:32.594
TAXPAYERS INCLUDING THE POOR.

01:15:32.661 --> 01:15:34.763
THAT THAT NOW THEY'RE STUCK WITH.

01:15:34.830 --> 01:15:36.632
AND YOU MAKE A GREAT ARGUMENT

01:15:36.698 --> 01:15:39.167
FOR WHY THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO

01:15:39.234 --> 01:15:41.837
WEIGH IN ON THIS THE LEGISLATURE.

01:15:41.904 --> 01:15:43.305
SHOULD WORK TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM

01:15:43.372 --> 01:15:44.539
OF NUISANCE AND MAKE SURE THAT

01:15:44.606 --> 01:15:46.341
WE GET IT RIGHT SO THAT THE BAD

01:15:46.408 --> 01:15:47.976
ACTORS ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. SO

01:15:48.043 --> 01:15:49.478
THAT WE'RE NOT HIM IMPACTING

01:15:49.544 --> 01:15:51.246
AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO THAT WE'RE

01:15:51.313 --> 01:15:52.748
NOT IMPACT IN THE POOR BECAUSE

01:15:52.814 --> 01:15:54.816
THEY.

01:15:54.883 --> 01:15:55.951
THEY'RE DOING THE WORST BUT YET

01:15:56.018 --> 01:15:57.653
YOUR.

01:15:57.719 --> 01:15:59.254
SUPPORTING A BALLOT MEASURE THAT

01:15:59.321 --> 01:16:00.956
THE LEGISLATURE CAN'T FIX CAN'T

01:16:01.023 --> 01:16:02.958
TOUCH CAN'T CHANGE AND THROWS

01:16:03.025 --> 01:16:03.959
ALL RESPONSIBILITY ON THE

01:16:04.026 --> 01:16:05.894
TAXPAYERS OF CALIFORNIA.

01:16:19.841 --> 01:16:21.610

SO YOU MAKE A GREAT ARGUMENT

01:16:23.679 --> 01:16:26.915
THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO BALLOT.

01:16:26.982 --> 01:16:28.650
AND THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD

01:16:28.717 --> 01:16:30.452

A BALLOT INITIATIVE MAILPIECE

01:16:49.938 --> 01:16:51.206
MOVING FORWARD SUGGESTING.

01:16:51.273 --> 01:16:52.507
OUR FORMER PRESIDENT MAY

01:16:52.574 --> 01:16:53.408
ACTUALLY BE SUPPORTING THE

01:16:53.475 --> 01:16:55.344
MEASURE SOLANO JUST MAKE CLEAR.

01:16:55.410 --> 01:16:56.311
IS PRESENT OBAMA SUPPORTING YOUR

01:16:56.378 --> 01:17:00.082

QUOTAS PAPERS ARE JUST ONE.

01:17:08.724 --> 01:17:09.558
AND SO PRESENT OBAMA IS NOT

PROBABLY COULD GIVE THE EXACT

01:17:22.838 --> 01:17:25.207
SAME SPEECH YOU JUST READ.

01:17:25.273 --> 01:17:28.810

YEAH YOU JUST QUOTED HIM

01:17:39.187 --> 01:17:40.922
SUGGESTING THAT HE MIGHT BE

01:17:40.989 --> 01:17:43.058
WORKING HE MIGHT BE ON THE SAME

01:17:43.125 --> 01:17:43.625
SIDE OF ONE THIS FORM AS IT

01:17:43.692 --> 01:17:44.359
HAPPENS.

01:17:44.426 --> 01:17:44.659
THE POINT.

01:17:44.726 --> 01:17:46.161
MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT I WAS THAT

01:17:46.228 --> 01:17:48.330
WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE IS THAT.

01:17:48.397 --> 01:17:49.498
WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THE

01:17:49.564 --> 01:17:52.067
PUBLIC POLICY THAT COMES OUT OF.

01:17:52.134 --> 01:17:54.069
OF THESE DECISIONS PARTICULARLY

01:17:54.136 --> 01:17:56.071
IN THE COURT A DECISION AND HOW

01:17:56.138 --> 01:17:57.606
DOES THAT AFFECT THE CITIZENS OF

01:17:57.672 --> 01:17:58.407
CALIFORNIA OR HOW DOES THAT

01:17:58.473 --> 01:17:59.775
AFFECT.

01:17:59.841 --> 01:18:01.810
YOU KNOW YOU MAKE A DECISION I

01:18:01.877 --> 01:18:03.211
HAVE POINT A HOW DOES THAT

01:18:03.278 --> 01:18:05.180
AFFECT POINT B.. ON YOU KNOW

01:18:05.247 --> 01:18:07.015
HIGH I I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO

01:18:07.082 --> 01:18:09.451
BE CAREFUL AYE AND AND WE HAVE

01:18:09.518 --> 01:18:10.852
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE POPE OF

01:18:10.919 --> 01:18:12.120
THE POLICY THAT COMES OUT OF

01:18:12.187 --> 01:18:14.222
THIS STUFF IS BOTTOM LINE. A OF

01:18:14.289 --> 01:18:15.724
ISN'T BEING HEALTH HELPFUL TO

01:18:15.791 --> 01:18:17.125
THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA SO

01:18:17.192 --> 01:18:19.061
AND I THINK WE ALL I THINK WE

01:18:19.127 --> 01:18:20.262
ALL APPRECIATE THAT I THINK THE

01:18:20.328 --> 01:18:22.197
CHALLENGE WE'RE. GRAPPLING WITH

01:18:22.264 --> 01:18:23.965
IS. I THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA

01:18:24.032 --> 01:18:26.201
WOULD STAND FOR THE PRINCIPLE.

01:18:26.268 --> 01:18:28.570
THAT IF YOU RESPONSIBLE.

01:18:28.637 --> 01:18:30.305
FOR TRAINING HARM YOU OUGHT TO

01:18:30.372 --> 01:18:32.307
HAVE A ROLE IN HELPING TO CLEAN

01:18:32.374 --> 01:18:32.941
IT UP DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD BE

01:18:33.008 --> 01:18:33.642
THE CASE.

01:18:33.708 --> 01:18:35.444
I BUT I WOULD SAY YES BUT BUT

01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:38.613
ALSO TO THE POINT THAT WE WE.

01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:40.515
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WE KNOW NOW. ON

01:18:40.582 --> 01:18:43.185
AGAIN SO KNOWING. WHAT WE KNOW

01:18:43.251 --> 01:18:44.419
NOW WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT?

01:18:44.486 --> 01:18:46.521
AS WHAT WHAT IS BEST.

01:18:46.588 --> 01:18:48.056
AS I SAID FOR THE PUBLIC WHAT IS

01:18:48.123 --> 01:18:49.691
GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA.

01:18:49.758 --> 01:18:52.094
AND HOW DO WE COME TO THAT POINT

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:54.796
AND. A LOT OF QUICK DECISION I

01:18:54.863 --> 01:18:55.497
MIGHT MATHIS NEED NOT

01:18:55.564 --> 01:18:56.798
NECESSARILY BE THE RIGHT TO HAVE

01:18:56.865 --> 01:18:58.300
BEEN YOU TO DO THAT SO SAW HIM

01:18:58.366 --> 01:18:59.668
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT WE KNEW

01:18:59.734 --> 01:19:01.169
THEN WHAT WE KNEW NOW I THINK.

01:19:01.236 --> 01:19:02.070
EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO WHEN THE

01:19:02.137 --> 01:19:03.605
LAWSUIT WAS BROUGHT WE DIDN'T

01:19:03.672 --> 01:19:05.474
KNOW. THAT THE LEAD PAINT

01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:09.444
COMPANIES KNEW WHAT THE IMPACT

01:19:09.511 --> 01:19:09.978
OF THEIR PRODUCTS WOULD BE

01:19:10.045 --> 01:19:11.546
HAVING KIDS RIGHT.

01:19:11.613 --> 01:19:12.180
WE WE LEARNED THAT THROUGH THE

01:19:12.247 --> 01:19:13.949
LAWSUIT UP THERE THE LEAD PAINT

01:19:14.015 --> 01:19:15.984
COMPANIES DISCOVERED. OR THEY

01:19:16.051 --> 01:19:18.320
KNEW FOR MANY DECADES.

01:19:18.386 --> 01:19:19.821
THAT THEIR PRODUCTS WERE

01:19:19.888 --> 01:19:22.390
POISONING CHILDREN RIGHT.

01:19:22.457 --> 01:19:23.725
I WASN'T ON THE OTHER END SO I

01:19:23.792 --> 01:19:25.460
DON'T.

01:19:25.527 --> 01:19:29.664
OKAY I THINK WE KNEW THAT.

01:19:29.731 --> 01:19:36.505
IT IF YOU KEPT OF I DECADES OF LITIGATION OVER THIS

01:19:36.571 --> 01:19:38.073
IS.

01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:38.940
AND LET ME TELL YOU A COUPLE

01:19:39.007 --> 01:19:40.142
THINGS THAT ARE UNDISPUTED FROM

01:19:40.208 --> 01:19:42.277
THE LAWSUIT. ONE IS THAT THESE

01:19:42.344 --> 01:19:43.712
COMPANIES NEVER CONCEALED.

01:19:43.778 --> 01:19:44.646
ANY INFORMATION CONCERNING

01:19:44.713 --> 01:19:46.248
HEALTH RISKS THE PRODUCT.

01:19:46.314 --> 01:19:48.183
THAT IS THAT IS CONCEDED

01:19:48.250 --> 01:19:48.750
TESTIMONY BY THE PLAINTIFFS

01:19:48.817 --> 01:19:49.751
EXPERTS

01:19:49.818 --> 01:19:51.720
IN THAT CASE.

01:19:51.786 --> 01:19:53.588
I JUST UNDERSTAND SO YOU SO YOU

01:19:53.655 --> 01:19:54.823
KNEW YOUR PRODUCT WAS GONNA HARM

01:19:54.890 --> 01:19:57.659
KID.

01:19:57.726 --> 01:19:58.593
YOU KNOW HOW TO BUT YOU KNOW

01:19:58.660 --> 01:19:59.261
THAT NO I'M GONNA TELL YOU ALSO

01:19:59.327 --> 01:20:01.329
THAT THERE WAS NO KNOWLEDGE THAT

01:20:01.396 --> 01:20:02.631
THESE COMPANIES HAD. THAT WAS

01:20:02.697 --> 01:20:03.632
DIFFERENT IN THE KNOWLEDGE THE

01:20:03.698 --> 01:20:06.201
PUBLIC HAD ABOUT WHAT THE RISKS

01:20:06.268 --> 01:20:07.602
WERE FROM PRODUCTS. LEADS A

01:20:07.669 --> 01:20:09.971
PRODUCT LEAD IS BEEN AROUND FOR

01:20:10.038 --> 01:20:10.906
CENTURIES.

01:20:10.972 --> 01:20:11.873
AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:14.009
WAS KNOWN EARLY ON IN THE

01:20:14.075 --> 01:20:15.577
NINETEEN HUNDREDS WAS

01:20:15.644 --> 01:20:17.345
OCCUPATIONAL RISKS

01:20:17.412 --> 01:20:18.213
THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT DID COME

01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:19.981
UP WITH THE TRIAL.

01:20:20.048 --> 01:20:22.217
AND I'LL TELL YOU ALSO THAT FOR

01:20:22.284 --> 01:20:24.085
SHARON WILLIAMS I KNOW THERE'S

01:20:24.152 --> 01:20:24.719
BEEN A NUMBER OF STATEMENTS FOR

01:20:24.786 --> 01:20:26.454
SHARON WILLIAMS.

01:20:26.521 --> 01:20:27.155
THERE'S A HANDFUL OF IN TURN WAS

01:20:27.222 --> 01:20:27.789
BEEN AROUND FOR ABOUT A HUNDRED

01:20:27.856 --> 01:20:29.391
AND FIFTY TWO YEARS NOW.

01:20:29.457 --> 01:20:31.626
SEAN WILLIAMS WAS IN THE LEAD

01:20:31.693 --> 01:20:33.728
PIGMENT MARKET ALSO MADE A LEAD

01:20:33.795 --> 01:20:35.664
PAINTS BUT HAD ONLY A HANDFUL OF

01:20:35.730 --> 01:20:37.566
LEAD PAINT FORMULA OF THE EARLY

01:20:37.632 --> 01:20:39.000
PART OF THE LAST CENTURY.

01:20:39.067 --> 01:20:41.002
WHAT IS ALSO CLEAR IS THAT

01:20:41.069 --> 01:20:42.571
SHARON WILLIAMS CONTRIBUTED ONLY

01:20:42.637 --> 01:20:44.673
POINT ZERO ONE PERCENT THIS IS

01:20:44.739 --> 01:20:46.408
UNDISPUTED FROM THE TRIAL POINT

01:20:46.474 --> 01:20:49.277
ZERO ONE PERCENT OF THE LEAD?

01:20:49.344 --> 01:20:51.112
THAT CAME INTO CALIFORNIA.

01:20:51.179 --> 01:20:53.081
POINT ZERO ONE PERCENT.

01:20:53.148 --> 01:20:54.583
OF THE LEAD AND THAT IS IN THE

01:20:54.649 --> 01:20:57.219
RECORD THE THIRD THING IS WHICH

01:20:57.285 --> 01:20:59.321
DAY IT'S ALSO ON DISPUTED AT

01:20:59.387 --> 01:21:01.923
TRIALTHAT NO COMPANY DID MORE.

01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:03.692
TO GET THE COMP COUNTRY TO MOVE

01:21:03.758 --> 01:21:05.894
AWAY FROM THE USE OF LEAD PAINT.

01:21:05.961 --> 01:21:07.229
THEN THE STORM WILLIAMS COMPANY

01:21:07.295 --> 01:21:08.563
IN FACT SURE WILLIAMS WAS OUT OF

01:21:08.630 --> 01:21:09.798
LEAD PAINT.

01:21:09.864 --> 01:21:11.433
FOR INTERIOR RESIDENTIAL.

01:21:11.499 --> 01:21:13.068
UP PAINS IN THE EARLY NINETEEN

01:21:13.134 --> 01:21:14.970
THIRTIES.

01:21:15.036 --> 01:21:17.372
LONG BEFORE THAT INDUSTRY MOVED

01:21:17.439 --> 01:21:18.773
AWAY FROM LEAD BASED PAINT AND

01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:20.408
THEN NINETEEN FIFTIES.

01:21:20.475 --> 01:21:22.544
AND CERTAINLY DECADES BEFORE THE

01:21:22.611 --> 01:21:23.245
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TOOK ANY

01:21:23.311 --> 01:21:25.013
ACTION. THAT'S ALSO SEPARATE

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:27.682
FROM THE FACT THAT DURING THE

01:21:27.749 --> 01:21:29.251
PERIOD IS HIS PICTURE ON IT

01:21:29.317 --> 01:21:32.120
TONIGHT. PRE SHAPING ANSWER THAT

01:21:32.187 --> 01:21:32.721
QUESTION I DO HAVE SOME FOLLOW

01:21:32.787 --> 01:21:33.855
UPS

01:21:33.922 --> 01:21:36.091
I ME JUST YET ABSALOM SERGEANT

01:21:36.157 --> 01:21:37.259
SHARPS WELL IT JUST TO CHANGE

01:21:37.325 --> 01:21:37.525
THE CAR.

01:21:37.592 --> 01:21:38.360
SO THE LEAD PAINT COMPANIES

01:21:38.426 --> 01:21:39.361
YOU'VE PROPOSED A TWO BILLION

01:21:39.427 --> 01:21:40.528
DOLLAR BALLOT INITIATIVE.

01:21:40.595 --> 01:21:41.796
WHICH WILL UNTIL ANOTHER ONE

01:21:41.863 --> 01:21:43.565
POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS OF

01:21:43.632 --> 01:21:45.400
INTEREST SO ABOUT FOUR BILLION

01:21:45.467 --> 01:21:46.768
DOLLARS A TAXPAYERS WANT TO PIN

01:21:46.835 --> 01:21:48.503
THE COMING YEARS RIGHT.

01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:49.704
SO THAT IS FOR YES.

01:21:49.771 --> 01:21:51.373
THAT IS FOR ASSISTANCE WITH

01:21:51.439 --> 01:21:52.641
SUBSTANDARD HOUSING THE DOESN'T

01:21:52.707 --> 01:21:55.343
ONLY RELATE TO LEAD SURE THAT'S

01:21:55.410 --> 01:21:56.378
CORRECT THAT SOME SORT OF

HOUSING SUPPORT TOOLS AND FOR

01:21:58.346 --> 01:21:59.080
SENIOR FACILITY SO THAT FOUR

01:21:59.147 --> 01:22:01.316
BILLION DOLLARS TO DRESS THE

01:22:01.383 --> 01:22:03.818
IMPACT OF OF. OF LEAD IN PAINT

01:22:03.885 --> 01:22:05.954
AND NOT FOR JUST NOT FOR JUST

01:22:06.021 --> 01:22:08.390
LET FOR OF SUBSTANDARD HOUSING.

01:22:08.456 --> 01:22:09.424
AND YOU'RE PROPOSING THAT

01:22:09.491 --> 01:22:10.258
CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS PAY THE

01:22:10.325 --> 01:22:13.495
HIGHER AMOUNT.

01:22:13.561 --> 01:22:15.163
RIGHT SO OF THESE OF THE BOND

01:22:15.230 --> 01:22:16.531
CORRECT OF THAT AMOUNT SO

01:22:16.598 --> 01:22:19.634
NOTHING TO BE PAID BY BY YOUR

01:22:19.701 --> 01:22:21.369
COMPANY OR OTHER COMPANIES.

01:22:21.436 --> 01:22:23.038
I'M GLAD YOU ASKED THAT AS YOU

01:22:23.104 --> 01:22:24.606
KNOW IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE THE

01:22:24.673 --> 01:22:26.007
LEGISLATURE FORMED A CHILDHOOD

01:22:26.074 --> 01:22:27.776
LEAD POISONING PREVENTION FEE.

01:22:27.842 --> 01:22:29.944
THE LEGISLATIVE I HISTORY SHOWS

01:22:30.011 --> 01:22:31.546
THAT THE LEGISLATURE INTENDED

01:22:31.613 --> 01:22:32.914
THAT FEE.

01:22:32.981 --> 01:22:36.518
TO FIND ALL LEAD PROGRAMS

01:22:36.584 --> 01:22:37.552
WHICH WERE CONCEIVED AT THAT

01:22:37.619 --> 01:22:38.687
TIME DEFINE ALL OF THOSE

01:22:38.753 --> 01:22:40.722
PROGRAMS.

01:22:40.789 --> 01:22:41.790
BUT FROM LOOKING BACK.

01:22:41.856 --> 01:22:43.658
PAST

01:22:43.725 --> 01:22:45.894
PRESENT USE OF LEAD BASED ON THE

01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:47.629
MARKET SHARE OF COMPANIES THAT

01:22:47.696 --> 01:22:50.231
WERE INVOLVED IN THE LEAD MARKET.

01:22:50.298 --> 01:22:51.633
THE DETERMINATION WAS THAN THAT

01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:53.435
EIGHTY PERCENT PERCENT.

01:22:53.501 --> 01:22:55.203
OF THAT FUND WOULD BE FROM OIL

01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:56.971
AND GAS COMPANIES A TORTOISE Y.

01:22:57.038 --> 01:22:57.939
CYPRESS APPRECIATE AT WHAT WAS

01:22:58.006 --> 01:22:59.107
THE DATE WHEN THAT. WHEN THAT

01:22:59.174 --> 01:23:00.608
STARTED IN NINETEEN STARTED IN

01:23:00.675 --> 01:23:01.743
NINETEEN NINETY ONE THE FIRST

01:23:01.810 --> 01:23:03.044
FEE I THINK WAS COLLECTED AT THE

01:23:03.111 --> 01:23:04.312
END OF NINETEEN NINETY TWO RIGHT

01:23:04.379 --> 01:23:05.680
AND THIS LAWSUIT STARTED IN TWO

01:23:05.747 --> 01:23:07.148
THOUSAND SO DISCOVERING THIS

01:23:07.215 --> 01:23:08.616
LAWSUIT DID NOT BEGIN UNTIL

01:23:08.683 --> 01:23:09.751
SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THAT THE

01:23:09.818 --> 01:23:12.420
PUBLIC. WAS NOT AWARE OF EXACTLY

01:23:12.487 --> 01:23:14.255
WHAT HAPPENED THEN WENT BUT WE

01:23:14.322 --> 01:23:14.856
KNEW THAT WE DO KNOW THAT NOW

01:23:14.923 --> 01:23:17.092
RIGHT.

01:23:17.158 --> 01:23:18.526
I'M SORRY MISS LETTERMAN I MY

01:23:18.593 --> 01:23:19.361
SWEET MY POINT IS THE

01:23:19.427 --> 01:23:20.628
LEGISLATURE WANTED ACTED IN THE

01:23:20.695 --> 01:23:20.995
EARLY NINETIES.

01:23:21.062 --> 01:23:22.297
DID NOT HAVE THE INFORMATION

01:23:22.364 --> 01:23:23.732
THAT WE DO TODAY NOR DID WE HAVE

01:23:23.798 --> 01:23:25.700
THE BENEFIT. OF EIGHTEEN YEARS

01:23:25.767 --> 01:23:28.636
OF LITIGATION. AND THE DISCOVERY

01:23:28.703 --> 01:23:30.438
IN THE INFORMATION THAT WE.

01:23:30.505 --> 01:23:32.674
HAVE ATTAINED SINCE THEN THAT

01:23:32.741 --> 01:23:33.708
WERE FOUND IN THE TRIAL COURT

01:23:33.775 --> 01:23:36.010
RULING. AN APPELLATE COURT

01:23:36.077 --> 01:23:36.978
RULING AND THE CALIFORNIA

01:23:37.045 --> 01:23:38.279
SUPREME COURT KNOW IT VERY GOOD

01:23:38.346 --> 01:23:39.547
POINT NOT ONLY DID THE

01:23:39.614 --> 01:23:41.916
LEGISLATURE NOT CONSIDER THAT.

01:23:41.983 --> 01:23:44.052
IT DECIDED ON ITS OWN THAT WOULD

01:23:44.119 --> 01:23:47.422
HOLD ANY FORMER MANUFACTURER OR

01:23:47.489 --> 01:23:48.623
DISTRIBUTOR OF LEAD.

01:23:48.690 --> 01:23:50.291
INTO THE ENVIRONMENT OF

01:23:50.358 --> 01:23:52.160
CALIFORNIA AT THAT TIME WITHOUT

01:23:52.227 --> 01:23:54.662
KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT

01:23:54.729 --> 01:23:56.164
COMPANIES KNEW OR DIDN'T KNOW.

01:23:56.231 --> 01:23:57.532
AND RATHER IT WAS AN EFFORT TO

01:23:57.599 --> 01:23:59.901
LOOK AT REMOVING THE IMPACT OF

01:23:59.968 --> 01:24:01.403
LEAD FROM THE ENVIRONMENT

01:24:01.469 --> 01:24:03.438
CALIFORNIA. NOW OVER THE YEARS

01:24:03.505 --> 01:24:04.973
THERE'S NEVER BEEN AN EFFORT TO

01:24:05.039 --> 01:24:06.274
INCREASE THAT FUND.

01:24:06.341 --> 01:24:08.543
NOR EVER IN EFFORT TO USE ANY OF

01:24:08.610 --> 01:24:09.644
THOSE FUNDS FOR ABATEMENT I I'M

01:24:09.711 --> 01:24:11.079
SORRY THAT YOUR

01:24:11.146 --> 01:24:11.679
IF YOU'RE MISSING THE POINT SO

01:24:11.746 --> 01:24:13.948
IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES.

01:24:14.015 --> 01:24:15.216
IT BASED ON THE INFORMATION THEY

01:24:15.283 --> 01:24:15.784
KNEW BUT THEY DIDN'T KNOW AT

01:24:15.850 --> 01:24:16.851
THAT TIME.

01:24:16.918 --> 01:24:17.886
BECAUSE THE LAWSUIT HADN'T

01:24:17.952 --> 01:24:20.321
STARTED EXACTLY WHAT THE IMPACT

01:24:20.388 --> 01:24:20.955
WAS OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:24:21.022 --> 01:24:22.190
TODAY.

01:24:22.257 --> 01:24:23.858
MAYBE I'M MAYBE I'M ANSWERING

01:24:23.925 --> 01:24:25.393
THE WRONG QUESTION BECAUSE THE

01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:26.694
INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE WAS TO

01:24:26.761 --> 01:24:29.230
MAKE SURE THAT THAT FUND.

01:24:29.297 --> 01:24:31.533
WAS SUFFICIENT TO DEAL WITH.

01:24:31.599 --> 01:24:33.535
ANY ISSUES RELATING TO THE

01:24:33.601 --> 01:24:34.669
PRESENCE OF LEAD IF THAT WERE

01:24:34.736 --> 01:24:35.904
THE CASE THEN ONE THE COURTS

01:24:35.970 --> 01:24:36.871
HAVE FOUND THAT NINETEEN NINETY

01:24:36.938 --> 01:24:38.440
ONE.

01:24:38.506 --> 01:24:40.475
STATUTE WOULD'VE PREEMPTED THE

01:24:40.542 --> 01:24:41.910
LAWSUIT I THINK IT DID NOT THE

01:24:41.976 --> 01:24:43.778
COURTSAID THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:24:43.845 --> 01:24:46.080
DID NOT DO ENOUGH.

01:24:46.147 --> 01:24:47.182
THAT THE LAWS ON THE BOOKS BY

01:24:47.248 --> 01:24:47.982
THE LEGISLATURE WERE NOT

01:24:48.049 --> 01:24:50.285
SUFFICIENT.

01:24:50.351 --> 01:24:51.085
SO IN OTHER WORDS YOU'RE

01:24:51.152 --> 01:24:52.053
SUGGESTING THAT.

01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:53.455
A NUMBER OF LAWS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:24:53.521 --> 01:24:55.123
PROPOSED RECENTLY TO MAKE IT

01:24:55.190 --> 01:24:56.558
EASIER TO GO AFTER THAT THE LEAD

01:24:56.624 --> 01:24:58.059
PAINT COMPANIES SHOULD BE PUT

01:24:58.126 --> 01:24:59.761
INTO EFFECT WELL I THINK THE

01:24:59.828 --> 01:25:01.196
POINT OF THE LEGISLATURE IF I

01:25:01.262 --> 01:25:02.597
REMEMBER THE ARGUMENT IN COURT.

01:25:02.664 --> 01:25:04.732
WAS THAT THE COURT SHOULD NEVER

01:25:04.799 --> 01:25:06.034
BE IN THE POSITION OF LOOKING AT

01:25:06.100 --> 01:25:08.136
WHETHER THE LEGISLATURE

01:25:08.203 --> 01:25:10.104
APPROPRIATED ENOUGH FUNDS.

01:25:10.171 --> 01:25:11.973
AND SO THAT BECAME THE ISSUE

01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:13.341
THAT WAS IN FRONT OF THE COURT

01:25:13.408 --> 01:25:14.809
AND THE COURT DETERMINED THAT

01:25:14.876 --> 01:25:16.644
NOT ENOUGH FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED

01:25:16.711 --> 01:25:17.312
THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE

01:25:17.378 --> 01:25:19.581
PROCEDURE. AND THAT THE

01:25:19.647 --> 01:25:21.516
LEGISLATURE'S DECISION.

01:25:21.583 --> 01:25:22.784
ON WHAT SURFACES HAD TO BE

01:25:22.851 --> 01:25:24.686
ABATED OR NOT ON BOTH THE STATE

01:25:24.752 --> 01:25:26.421
AND LOCAL LEVEL WERE NOT GUIDING

01:25:26.488 --> 01:25:27.956
UPON THE COURT EITHER THE COURT

01:25:28.022 --> 01:25:29.991
DETERMINED MORE SURFACES.

01:25:30.058 --> 01:25:31.893
NEEDED TO BE OBEYED I I THINK

01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:34.896
WILL WILL WILL LIBERATED RESPECT

01:25:34.963 --> 01:25:35.763
TO SURROUND THE SPOT I'M SORRY

01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:36.931
MISTER CHAIR FIGHTING ANSWER

YOUR QUESTION DIRECTLY WANT TO

01:25:38.933 --> 01:25:39.367
ASK A QUESTION TO MISTER

01:25:39.434 --> 01:25:39.801
ANDERSON.

01:25:39.868 --> 01:25:41.402
IN YOUR TESTIMONY YOU SUGGESTED

01:25:41.469 --> 01:25:42.770
THAT THE IMPACT OF THIS DECISION

01:25:42.837 --> 01:25:44.138
ON ON REAL ESTATE AND MORTGAGES

01:25:44.205 --> 01:25:46.274
AT THERAPY FINANCIAL IMPACTS ON

01:25:46.341 --> 01:25:48.343
ON HOMES AND VALUES TO

01:25:48.409 --> 01:25:49.444
HOMEOWNERS IS THAT RIGHT.

01:25:49.511 --> 01:25:50.945
CORRECT OKAY AND AND YOU DO KNOW

01:25:51.012 --> 01:25:52.747
THAT. SAY THE CALIFORNIA

01:25:52.814 --> 01:25:54.115
ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS.

01:25:54.182 --> 01:25:56.050
DISAGREES WITH THAT PERSPECTIVE

01:25:56.117 --> 01:25:58.019
WRITER. AND BUT YOU KNOW IT'S

01:25:58.086 --> 01:25:59.320
INTERESTING IN THE LAST COUPLE

01:25:59.387 --> 01:26:00.855
OF YEARS PARTICULARLY SINCE TWO

01:26:00.922 --> 01:26:01.956
THOUSAND FOURTEEN WHEN THIS

01:26:02.023 --> 01:26:03.525
RULING CAME DOWN. I DON'T THINK

01:26:03.591 --> 01:26:05.426
ANYONE IS SEEN ANY IMPACT ON

01:26:05.493 --> 01:26:07.362
HOME PRICES IN THE STATE OF

01:26:07.428 --> 01:26:08.229
CALIFORNIA.

01:26:08.296 --> 01:26:09.597
BECAUSE OF LEAD PAINT THAT HAS

01:26:09.664 --> 01:26:11.766
BEEN IN THESE HOMES.

01:26:11.833 --> 01:26:12.700
REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENED WITH

01:26:12.767 --> 01:26:14.369
THAT RULING RIGHT THE LEAD PAINT

01:26:14.435 --> 01:26:16.271
BEEN IN THE HOMES FOR DECADES SO

01:26:16.337 --> 01:26:19.140
THAT FACTOR HAS BEEN BAKED INTO

01:26:19.207 --> 01:26:21.109
THE PRICE OF HOMES ISN'T RIGHT.

01:26:21.175 --> 01:26:24.312
ALRIGHT I THINK THE PUBLIC IS.

01:26:24.379 --> 01:26:26.781
COMPLETELY UNAWARE OF. THE

01:26:26.848 --> 01:26:27.448
RECENT LITIGATION AND THE

01:26:27.515 --> 01:26:30.451
POTENTIAL EFFECTS.

THAT. THAT YES SAID ACTUALLY

01:26:33.488 --> 01:26:34.556
THAT MAYBE.

01:26:34.622 --> 01:26:35.323
AND I THINK.

01:26:35.390 --> 01:26:37.959
WELL WE CAN WE CAN LEAVE IT AT

01:28:16.024 --> 01:28:17.925
AND HAULING SOME BEING A PUBLIC

01:28:17.992 --> 01:28:21.763
NUISANCE AND CASTING. A WIDE NET

01:28:21.829 --> 01:28:23.765
OVER PEOPLE WHO WERE FOLLOWING

01:28:23.831 --> 01:28:26.768
THOSE LIBERALS.

01:28:26.834 --> 01:28:28.836
HOMEOWNERS WHO MADE SURE THAT

01:28:28.903 --> 01:28:29.871
THEIR HOMES WHO LIVABLE FOR

01:28:29.937 --> 01:28:31.339
THEIR FAMILIES.

01:28:31.406 --> 01:28:32.907
THESE ARE THE ISSUES IN WHICH MY

01:28:32.974 --> 01:28:34.909
ORGANIZATION AND FORTY YEARS

01:28:34.976 --> 01:28:37.178
WORTH OF. OF PUBLIC HOUSING AND%

01:28:37.245 --> 01:28:39.280
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IS WHAT I'M

01:28:39.347 --> 01:28:42.150
ADDRESSING AND I DO BELIEVE THAT

01:28:42.216 --> 01:28:44.652
THE LEGISLATURE AND THE PEOPLE

01:28:44.719 --> 01:28:47.121
WILL MAKE A DECISION HOW TO

01:28:47.188 --> 01:28:48.956
ADDRESS THESE ISSUES.

01:28:49.023 --> 01:28:51.225
AND HAVING.

01:28:51.292 --> 01:28:52.760
THEN IN FRONT OF CONGRESS

01:28:52.827 --> 01:28:54.262
TALKING ABOUT THE SAME THING

01:28:54.328 --> 01:28:55.797
HAVING BEEN IN FRONT OF TOWN

01:28:55.863 --> 01:28:57.298
HOMES TALKING ABOUT THE SAME

01:28:57.365 --> 01:28:59.300
THINGS. I USUALLY FIND THE BEST

01:28:59.367 --> 01:29:01.836
SOLUTIONS ARE LEGISLATURE'S ITS

01:29:01.903 --> 01:29:04.639
CITY COUNCILS IT'S TOWN HALLS

01:29:04.706 --> 01:29:06.374
IT'S COUNTY COMMISSIONERS. IN

01:29:06.441 --> 01:29:09.277
WHICH. IF FORTY YEARS I HAVE

01:29:09.343 --> 01:29:10.978
WORKED ON EVERY LEVEL AND.

01:29:11.045 --> 01:29:13.614
I THINK THIS DECISION.

01:29:13.681 --> 01:29:16.217
THIS DECISION DOES MORE HARM

01:29:16.284 --> 01:29:18.419
THAN GOOD SO I THINK I I I I I

01:29:18.486 --> 01:29:20.221
APPRECIATE YOUR PERSPECTIVE A I

01:29:20.288 --> 01:29:21.522
DO FIND IT INTERESTING THAT THE

01:29:21.589 --> 01:29:22.990
PROPONENTS FOR THIS INITIATIVE

01:29:23.057 --> 01:29:23.558
YOU ARE ALL SAYING TODAY THE

01:29:23.624 --> 01:29:25.159
LEGISLATURE.

01:29:25.226 --> 01:29:27.462
HE WHERE WE SOLVE THIS AND YET I

01:29:27.528 --> 01:29:29.297
DIDN'T HEAR I DON'T THINK ANY OF

01:29:29.363 --> 01:29:30.364
US CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG

01:29:30.431 --> 01:29:31.799
COLLEAGUES I DON'T THINK ANY OF

01:29:31.866 --> 01:29:34.001
US HEARD FROM YOU.

01:29:34.068 --> 01:29:35.036
BEFORE YOU PUT THIS BALLOT

01:29:35.103 --> 01:29:36.370
MEASURE ON C. DECIDED ON THE

01:29:36.437 --> 01:29:37.772
BALLOT PROCESS WITHOUT COME TO

01:29:37.839 --> 01:29:38.673
THE LEGISLATURE AWARENESS.

01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:40.875
I.

01:29:40.942 --> 01:29:42.376
I HEAR WHAT YOU SAID BUT I HAVE

01:29:42.443 --> 01:29:44.412
BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE

01:29:44.479 --> 01:29:45.947
FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS CHORE AND

01:29:46.013 --> 01:29:48.883
YOU KNOW I THINK I THINK I SHARE.

01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:49.884
I THINK WE HAVE A STRONG POINT

01:29:49.951 --> 01:29:51.686
OF AGREEMENT ON THE IMPACT OF

01:29:51.753 --> 01:29:54.088
LEAD POISONING ON COMMUTER COLOR

01:29:54.155 --> 01:29:54.756
AND LOG MUSICAL.

01:29:54.822 --> 01:29:56.724
A BUSINESS.

01:29:56.791 --> 01:29:58.459
I'M HEALTHY HOUSING ON HEALTHY

01:29:58.526 --> 01:30:01.863
HOUSE HAS BUT I THINK THE

01:30:01.929 --> 01:30:03.464
OF US IT'S WHO WANT TO PAY FOR

01:30:03.531 --> 01:30:04.065
THAT WHO WANT TO BE LIABLE FOR

01:30:04.132 --> 01:30:04.632
THAT.

01:30:04.699 --> 01:30:05.733
AND THE BALLOT INITIATIVE TAKES

01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:07.335
ONE PERSPECTIVE WHICH IS THE

01:30:07.401 --> 01:30:09.470
TAXPAYERS A CALIFORNIA. OUGHT TO

01:30:09.537 --> 01:30:11.739
PAY FOR BILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS

01:30:11.806 --> 01:30:13.875
CLEANUP INSPECTION A REMEDIATION.

01:30:13.941 --> 01:30:17.211
AND EDUCATION AND THE COMPANIES

01:30:17.278 --> 01:30:18.813
THAT PROFITED FROM THIS.

01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:21.382
OUGHT TO NOT HAVE TO PAY A DIME.

01:30:21.449 --> 01:30:23.518
AND IN FACT OUGHT TO HAVE EVEN

01:30:23.584 --> 01:30:25.353
THE SEMBLANCE SUPPLY BUILDING ON

01:30:25.419 --> 01:30:26.687
THE BOOKS WIPED OFF THE BOOKS.

01:30:26.754 --> 01:30:29.290
IN THIS BALLOT MEASURE.

01:30:29.357 --> 01:30:32.126
BY TWENTY VIEW AND THAT IS.

01:30:32.193 --> 01:30:34.629
YES BUT MY IN TERMS OF IT WILL

01:30:34.695 --> 01:30:36.831
BE UP TO THE CITIZENS OF

01:30:36.898 --> 01:30:37.465
CALIFORNIA WHERE THEY'RE NOT BE

01:30:37.532 --> 01:30:39.300
PASSED THIS INITIATIVE. WHATEVER

01:30:39.367 --> 01:30:40.234
LOOKS LIKE

01:30:40.301 --> 01:30:42.904
SO. DO YOU THINK THE CITIZENS OF

01:30:42.970 --> 01:30:44.872
TELL IF CALIFORNIA.

01:30:44.939 --> 01:30:47.942
OUGHT TO COMPLETELY ABSOLVE

01:30:48.009 --> 01:30:49.944
COMPANIES THAT MAY HAVE PROFITED

01:30:50.011 --> 01:30:51.813
FROM POISONING CHILDREN.

01:30:51.879 --> 01:30:53.981
COMPLETELY ABSOLVE THEM AND AND

01:30:54.048 --> 01:30:55.316
PUT ON THEMSELVES OF FOUR

01:30:55.383 --> 01:30:57.485
BILLION DOLLAR PRICE TAG.

01:30:57.552 --> 01:30:59.353
I WOULDN'T PUTTING IN THAT WAY

01:30:59.420 --> 01:31:01.055
AND I AM SURE HOWEVER AND BUT

01:31:01.122 --> 01:31:02.957
I'M NOT SPEAKING FOR THIS IT IS

01:31:03.024 --> 01:31:04.525
OF OF CALIFORNIA.

01:31:04.592 --> 01:31:05.993
IF YOU KNOW YOU WERE YOU TALKED

01:31:06.060 --> 01:31:07.028
ABOUT THE LAWSUIT AND THE IMPACT

01:31:07.094 --> 01:31:08.296
TO COMMUTE OF COLOR AND LET ME

01:31:08.362 --> 01:31:10.198
JUST CITE ONE OF THE DOCUMENTS

01:31:10.264 --> 01:31:12.066
IT CAME OUT THROUGH THAT LAWSUIT

01:31:12.133 --> 01:31:12.834
YOU'RE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH

01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:13.568
THAT.

01:31:13.634 --> 01:31:15.036
THERE WAS A LEAD PAINT LOBBYIST

01:31:15.102 --> 01:31:16.838
IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES THAT WAS

01:31:16.904 --> 01:31:18.339
COMPLAINING ABOUT THE PUBLICITY

01:31:18.406 --> 01:31:19.674
PROBLEM.

01:31:19.740 --> 01:31:21.409
THE PUBLICITY PROBLEM OF LEAD

01:31:21.475 --> 01:31:23.811
POISONING AND IF I MAY QUOTE.

01:31:23.878 --> 01:31:24.345
ASIDE FROM THE KIDS WERE

01:31:24.412 --> 01:31:26.814
POISONED. IT'S A SERIOUS PROBLEM

01:31:26.881 --> 01:31:27.448
FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF THAT VERSE

01:31:27.515 --> 01:31:29.617
PUBLICITY.

01:31:29.684 --> 01:31:30.918
THE BASIC SOLUTION IS TO GET RID

01:31:30.985 --> 01:31:33.054
OF OUR SLUMS BUT EVEN UNCLE SAM

01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:34.555
CAN'T SWING THAT ONE.

01:31:34.622 --> 01:31:36.190
MOST OF THE CASES ARE IN NEGRO

01:31:36.257 --> 01:31:38.059
AND PER REGION FAMILIES AND HOW

01:31:38.125 --> 01:31:40.394
DOES ONE TACKLE THAT JOB.

01:31:40.461 --> 01:31:42.230
THIS IS A DOCUMENT THAT WAS

01:31:42.296 --> 01:31:44.131
CIRCULATED.

01:31:44.198 --> 01:31:46.400
BY THE LEAD PAINT INDUSTRY THIS

01:31:46.467 --> 01:31:47.869
IS WHAT THEY KNEW IN THE

01:31:47.935 --> 01:31:49.770
NINETEEN FIFTIES THIS IS WHAT WE

01:31:49.837 --> 01:31:52.707
DID NOT LEARN UNTIL RECENT YEARS.

01:31:52.773 --> 01:31:54.642
HAVE YOU HAD YOU FEEL ABOUT WHO

01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:55.543
OUGHT TO PAY FOR THIS.

01:31:55.610 --> 01:31:57.912
IT IT.

01:31:57.979 --> 01:31:59.447
IT'S NOT WHO OUGHT TO PAY FOR

01:31:59.513 --> 01:32:00.248
THAT STATEMENT I'VE READ SEVERAL

01:32:00.314 --> 01:32:01.682
TIMES

01:32:01.749 --> 01:32:03.217
AND I THINK THE COMMITTEE NUMBER

01:32:03.284 --> 01:32:06.387
OF INDUSTRIES. WHO FOR PROFIT

01:32:06.454 --> 01:32:08.522
MOTIVATED REASONS WOULD

01:32:08.589 --> 01:32:10.625
DENIGRATE WHOLE SWATHS OF

01:32:10.691 --> 01:32:12.693
INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE THEY? ARE

01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:14.528
THEY WERE WHO THEY ARE.

01:32:14.595 --> 01:32:18.699
HAVING SAID THAT. IT'S BEEN MY.

01:32:18.766 --> 01:32:20.801
I GUESS LIFE'S WORK IS TO

01:32:20.868 --> 01:32:23.604
COUNTERACT THAT SORT OF THINKING.

01:32:23.671 --> 01:32:25.539
THAT EVERYBODY DESERVES A SAFE

01:32:25.606 --> 01:32:27.208
AND.

01:32:27.275 --> 01:32:29.010
AND CLEAN HOUSE.

01:32:29.076 --> 01:32:30.311
AND AND THAT'S JUST WHAT IT IS

01:32:30.378 --> 01:32:31.412
AND.

01:32:31.479 --> 01:32:33.414
I CAN'T GO BACK TO THE NINETEEN

01:32:33.481 --> 01:32:35.449
FIFTIES I CAN LOOK AT TODAY AND

01:32:35.516 --> 01:32:37.618
GO FOR AND.

01:32:37.685 --> 01:32:38.920
I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY

WILL CONTINUE IN JUST A AND BY

01:32:55.136 --> 01:32:56.337
ASKING YOU KNOW HOW MANY KIDS

01:33:15.456 --> 01:33:18.893
THE LIABILITY.

01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:21.963
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WE.

01:33:22.029 --> 01:33:24.131
REALTORS HAVE TO DISCLOSE IF

01:33:30.638 --> 01:33:32.540
TO ME THAT THE COURT OF APPEALS

01:36:23.110 --> 01:36:25.546
THE HOUSING MARKET.

APPELLATE COURTS POSITION THAT

01:41:53.373 --> 01:41:54.942
AFTER REVIEWING. THAT THE TRIAL

01:41:55.008 --> 01:41:56.443
COURT WAS CORRECT IN THEIR

01:41:56.510 --> 01:41:57.945

SPONSORED CONFERENCES.

01:42:14.895 --> 01:42:16.396
THE COURT EXPRESSLY FOUND THE

01:42:16.463 --> 01:42:19.199
DEFENDANTS KNEW IN THE NINETEEN

01:42:19.266 --> 01:42:21.635

THE DEFENDANTS KNEW BOTH. THAT

01:42:33.614 --> 01:42:36.283
HIGH LEVEL EXPOSURE TO LEAD AND

IN PARTICULAR LEAD PAINT.

01:42:39.253 --> 01:42:41.955

LEAD DUST RESULTING FROM THIS

01:43:05.479 --> 01:43:07.948
DETERIORATION WOULD POISON

01:43:08.015 --> 01:43:10.017
CHILDREN. AND CAUSE SERIOUS

01:43:10.083 --> 01:43:11.785

PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF

01:43:34.808 --> 01:43:38.512

THAT.

01:43:44.785 --> 01:43:47.521
THE IN THE PAST THAT THIS WAS.

01:43:47.588 --> 01:43:49.089
A PROBLEM THAT WAS NOT

01:43:49.156 --> 01:43:50.257
ADDRESSED IN AND HAS BEEN

01:43:50.324 --> 01:43:52.025
ADDRESS I THINK TO THE POINT

01:43:52.092 --> 01:43:52.593
WHERE.

01:43:52.659 --> 01:43:54.661
YOU KNOW THE LEAD AINT AND

01:43:54.728 --> 01:43:56.263
PAINT OR IS NOW NO LONGER

EXISTED. AND THAT IT'S IT'S IT'S

01:43:58.799 --> 01:44:01.068
NOW AT LEVELS THAT ARE TO TO

01:44:01.134 --> 01:44:02.369
MISTER DEEDS THIS POINT I THINK

01:44:02.436 --> 01:44:04.805
POINT ONE ZERO. I I MEAN I I

01:44:04.871 --> 01:44:06.540
THINK YES AND I THINK WHAT WE

01:44:06.607 --> 01:44:08.241
NEED TO DO IS WE NEED TO LOOK AT

01:44:08.308 --> 01:44:09.843
WHAT IS HAPPENING CORRECTLY INTO

01:44:09.910 --> 01:44:10.877
WHAT WHAT IS HAPPENING TODAY

01:44:10.944 --> 01:44:12.546
WITH THIS DECISION. AND HOW IS

01:44:12.613 --> 01:44:13.981
IT NOT ONLY GONNA FACT

01:44:14.047 --> 01:44:15.549
HOMEOWNERS BUT HOW'S IT GONNA

01:44:15.616 --> 01:44:16.883
AFFECT OUR COMMUNITIES AND HOW

01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:18.685
IS IT HOW HOW IS IT COULD HAVE

01:44:18.752 --> 01:44:20.420
POSSIBLY DISPLACE FOLKS. ON AND

01:44:20.487 --> 01:44:21.688
I THINK THOSE ARE IMPORTANT

01:44:21.755 --> 01:44:22.923
THINGS TO LOOK AT THIS AND THE

01:44:22.990 --> 01:44:23.790
POINT THAT I WAS TRYING TO MAKE

01:44:23.857 --> 01:44:25.058
EARLIER IS THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK

01:44:25.125 --> 01:44:26.793
AT THIS HOLISTICALLY. AND WE

01:44:26.860 --> 01:44:28.295
HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS AS IT IN IN

01:44:28.362 --> 01:44:29.162
A WAY.

01:44:29.229 --> 01:44:30.964
IS HOW IT'S GONNA AFFECT OUR

01:44:31.031 --> 01:44:32.399
CONSTITUENTS HOW IT'S GONNA

01:44:32.466 --> 01:44:34.468
AFFECT YOUR CONSTITUENTS AND AND

01:44:34.534 --> 01:44:35.869
AND WE'RE GOING ANABSOLUTE YOUR

01:44:35.936 --> 01:44:37.638
POINT YES WELL I THINK WE SHOULD

01:44:37.704 --> 01:44:39.306
LET PEOPLE KNOW. I DO YOU

01:44:39.373 --> 01:44:42.643
BELIEVE THEY ON. THAT.

01:44:42.709 --> 01:44:44.378
THIS THREE PAINT COMPANIES.

01:44:44.444 --> 01:44:47.014
FOUND BY THE COURTS TO HAVE BEEN

01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:49.683
RESPONSIBLE.

01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:52.152

01:44:52.219 --> 01:44:54.321
HAVE TO PAY A PENNY I THINK WHAT

01:44:54.388 --> 01:44:55.589
SHOULD HAPPEN IS I THINK THAT OF

01:44:55.656 --> 01:44:56.823
THE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD WORK

01:44:56.890 --> 01:44:58.525
TOGETHER. AND COME TOGETHER TO

01:44:58.592 --> 01:45:00.527
DECIDE SPECTACULARLY WITH THE

01:45:00.594 --> 01:45:01.795
LEGISLATURE WHAT IS THE BEST

01:45:01.862 --> 01:45:03.130
COURSE OF ACTION.

01:45:03.196 --> 01:45:05.298
VERY SPECIFICALLY THE COURT

01:45:05.365 --> 01:45:07.668
FOUND THAT.

01:45:07.734 --> 01:45:09.469
OVER JUST OVER ONE POINT ONE TO

01:45:09.536 --> 01:45:11.972
ALMOST A ONE POINT TWO BILLION.

01:45:12.039 --> 01:45:13.774
IS WHAT NEEDED TO BE PAID BY THE

01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:15.208
THREE.

01:45:15.275 --> 01:45:17.411
PAINT COMPANIES.

01:45:17.477 --> 01:45:19.212
DO YOU THINK THAT

01:45:19.279 --> 01:45:21.348
WE SHOULD DECIDE THAT THEY

01:45:21.415 --> 01:45:22.749
SHOULDN'T HAVE THE PAINT COMPANY

01:45:22.816 --> 01:45:24.217
SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY.

01:45:24.284 --> 01:45:26.119
I I I I AGAIN I I DON'T THINK

01:45:26.186 --> 01:45:27.988
THAT IT'S WHO I THINK PEOPLE

01:45:28.055 --> 01:45:29.322
NEED TO COME TOGETHER.

01:45:29.389 --> 01:45:30.757
AND WE NEED TO DECIDE WHAT IS

01:45:30.824 --> 01:45:31.825
GOOD FOR THE CONSTITUENTS A

01:45:31.892 --> 01:45:32.392
CALIFORNIA AND HOW DOES THAT

THAT THE THREE PAINT COMPANIES

BE PICKED UP. BY THE PEOPLE OF

01:45:51.111 --> 01:45:53.547
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:45:53.613 --> 01:45:55.615

POINT TWO BILLION PAID BY THE

01:46:21.208 --> 01:46:23.577
PAINT COMPANIES AND THEREAFTER

THE LEGISLATURE MEETS TO DO WILL

01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:28.281
CERTAINLY THE LEGISLATURE CAN

ADDRESS THAT.

01:46:30.150 --> 01:46:32.552

THREE PAINT COMPANIES SHOULD

MAKE THAT FINDING AND THAT THE

01:47:14.261 --> 01:47:16.229
COURT OF APPEALS.

01:47:16.296 --> 01:47:18.398
CONFIRMED THAT FINDING.

01:47:18.465 --> 01:47:20.333
YOU BELIEVE THAT.

01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:21.434
THREE POINT COMPANIES SHOULD NOT

01:47:21.501 --> 01:47:23.036
PAY THEM IN FACT.

01:47:23.103 --> 01:47:24.771
IS IT YOUR OPINION THAT IS IT IS

01:47:24.838 --> 01:47:25.572
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF

CALIFORNIA THAT SHOULD FOOT THE

01:47:26.973 --> 01:47:28.575
BILL.

01:47:28.642 --> 01:47:29.976
TO PAY FOR THAT INSTEAD NOT KNOW

01:47:30.043 --> 01:47:32.012
WHAT I WHAT I AGAIN WHAT I THINK.

01:47:32.078 --> 01:47:33.847
YOU KNOW I WILL.

01:47:33.914 --> 01:47:35.582
I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS WE

01:47:35.649 --> 01:47:36.983
NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS THE

01:47:37.050 --> 01:47:39.386
BEST COURSE OF ACTION.

01:47:39.452 --> 01:47:41.288
YOU NO HIGH I IT'S SOMETHING

01:47:41.354 --> 01:47:43.223
THAT WE HAVE TO SEIZE DISCUSSES

01:47:43.290 --> 01:47:44.424
SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO FIGURE

01:47:44.491 --> 01:47:45.692
OUT AND HAVE WE HAVE TO WORK OUT

01:47:45.759 --> 01:47:46.660
TO I THINK THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN

01:47:46.726 --> 01:47:48.128
DISCUSSED BEFORE THE PROPOSITION

01:47:48.195 --> 01:47:49.629
WAS PUT ON THE BALLOT THE

01:47:49.696 --> 01:47:51.498
INITIATIVE WAS PUT ON THE BALLOT.

01:47:51.565 --> 01:47:54.901
YOU KNOW WE WE.

01:47:54.968 --> 01:47:56.336
WE COULD HAVE TALKED TO

01:47:56.403 --> 01:47:57.170
DIFFERENT FOLKS.

01:47:57.237 --> 01:47:58.572
BUT BUT YOU KNOW THIS IS THE

01:47:58.638 --> 01:47:59.673
POINT WHERE WE'RE AT AND I THINK

01:47:59.739 --> 01:48:01.341
THAT YOU SET IT BECAUSE YOU SAID

01:48:01.408 --> 01:48:03.343
WE ALL SHOULD.

01:48:03.410 --> 01:48:05.011
DID WE ALL DO THAT BEFORE THE

01:48:05.078 --> 01:48:08.114
INITIATIVE WAS PUT ON THE BALLOT.

01:48:08.181 --> 01:48:10.217
I WASN'T TO I'M WHERE I WAS AND

01:48:10.283 --> 01:48:12.018
BEFORE SO IT.

01:48:12.085 --> 01:48:13.220
IF YOU DON'T MIND I CAN ANSWER

01:48:13.286 --> 01:48:14.754
AT TWO PARTS OF THAT.

01:48:14.821 --> 01:48:16.323
NUMBER ONE IS AS YOU KNOW

01:48:16.389 --> 01:48:17.724
THERE'S BEEN A RECENT SETTLEMENT

01:48:17.791 --> 01:48:19.192
WITH AND I'LL INDUSTRIES WHICH

01:48:19.259 --> 01:48:20.894
PAID SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS.

01:48:20.961 --> 01:48:22.295
THIRTY THREE PERCENT OF THAT IS

01:48:22.362 --> 01:48:23.964
GOING TO GO TO. ARE THE TRIAL

01:48:24.030 --> 01:48:25.465
LAWYERS OF THE CASES YOU KNOW

REASONS FOR THE BALLOT

01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:29.930
INITIATIVE. IS TO CREATE A FUND

01:49:29.996 --> 01:49:31.197

FOR A DECISION FROM THE

APPELLATE COURT WE HAD NO IDEA

01:51:23.143 --> 01:51:24.210
WHAT THE APPELLATE COURT WAS

01:51:24.277 --> 01:51:26.413
GOING TO SIDE CERTAINLY. AS THAT

I AS THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN MENTION

WENT UP ON APPEAL SO WHEN WE

SOME UNKNOWNS NUMBER ONE IS WHAT

01:51:36.322 --> 01:51:38.024
WOULD THE COURT DECIDE FOR

01:51:38.091 --> 01:51:39.292
EXAMPLE NO WAY TO PROTECT

01:51:39.359 --> 01:51:40.060
THAT THE APPELLATE COURT WOULD

01:51:40.126 --> 01:51:41.361
DECIDE THAT NINETEEN FIFTY TO

01:51:41.428 --> 01:51:43.129
NINETEEN EIGHTY HOMES WOULD BE

01:51:43.196 --> 01:51:45.098
CUT OUT. OF GETTING AN ABATEMENT

01:51:45.165 --> 01:51:46.199

DESIGNATION OF A PUBLIC NUISANCE

01:51:48.334 --> 01:51:49.302
SO THAT WAS ONE CHANGE THAT

01:51:49.369 --> 01:51:50.837
HAPPENED AND JUST LAST WEEK WE

01:51:50.904 --> 01:51:52.072
LEARNED OF THE OTHER CHANGE.

01:51:52.138 --> 01:51:53.006
IN TERMS OF THE FORTY MILLION

DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT. I'M

01:52:00.346 --> 01:52:01.748

REASON TO BE HERE CRAFT YEAH THE

01:52:09.622 --> 01:52:11.257
REASON I THE REASON I MENTION IT

01:52:11.324 --> 01:52:18.932
IS THE COURT DECISION AS YOU

01:52:18.998 --> 01:52:20.033
PROBABLY KNOW. DID NOT.

01:52:20.100 --> 01:52:22.068
FROM THE COURTS.

01:52:22.135 --> 01:52:23.603
IF THEY GO BACK TO THE LOCAL

01:52:23.670 --> 01:52:29.409
JUST JURISDICTIONS AND COLLECT

01:52:29.476 --> 01:52:30.977
FROM THE JACKET FROM THE FOR.

01:52:31.044 --> 01:52:32.479
MIDDLEMAN OF ONE POINT ONE SIX

01:52:32.545 --> 01:52:34.714
BILLION. OR THE AMOUNT THAT THE

01:52:34.781 --> 01:52:35.949
THAT THE TRIAL COURT MAY

01:52:36.015 --> 01:52:37.350
READJUST THAT NUMBER TO.

01:52:37.417 --> 01:52:39.285
THE COURT SAID IT WAS BOUND NOT

01:52:39.352 --> 01:52:40.787
TO AWARD OR ALLOW THE

01:52:40.854 --> 01:52:42.755
JURISDICTIONS TOWARD ANY OF THAT

01:52:42.822 --> 01:52:44.457
MONEY SO THE REASON I RAISE IT

01:52:44.524 --> 01:52:45.225
AND I'M NOT TRYING TO BE

01:52:45.291 --> 01:52:46.793
RECESSED DISRESPECTFUL ANY

01:52:46.860 --> 01:52:49.429
ATTORNEY. THE IDEA IS THOUGH

01:52:49.496 --> 01:52:51.097
THAT WHEN A SETTLEMENT OCCURS

01:52:51.164 --> 01:52:53.733
AND MONEY DOES GO. NOT ONLY TO

01:52:53.800 --> 01:52:55.435
THE JURISDICTION BUT TO USE TO

01:52:55.502 --> 01:52:57.203
BE TO PAY ATTORNEY'S FEES.

01:52:57.270 --> 01:52:58.872
THEN IT YOU KNOW IT'S RELEVANT

01:52:58.938 --> 01:53:00.073
TO HOW MUCH MONEY IS ACTUALLY

01:53:00.140 --> 01:53:02.609
GOING. TO THE PROGRAM THAT WILL

01:53:02.675 --> 01:53:04.477
BE IN PLACE AND I DON'T.

01:53:04.544 --> 01:53:05.845
THAT MONEY IS DESIGNATED

01:53:05.912 --> 01:53:07.981
SPECIFICALLY FOR ABATEMENT AGAIN

01:53:08.047 --> 01:53:09.015
IT CAN BE USED FOR WHATEVER IT

01:53:09.082 --> 01:53:10.083
IS BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE

01:53:10.150 --> 01:53:11.751
HELPFUL TO LEARN HOW THAT'S

01:53:11.818 --> 01:53:13.019
GOING TO BE YEARS SO THAT WAS

01:53:13.086 --> 01:53:14.053
ONE OF THE OTHER THERE'S A

01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:15.388
NUMBER OF CHANGES THAT HAPPENED

01:53:15.455 --> 01:53:17.190
FROM THE TIME. WHEN WE FILED THE

01:53:17.257 --> 01:53:18.758
INITIATIVE.

01:53:18.825 --> 01:53:20.894

THIS BODY. SO YES THERE IS A

01:53:30.270 --> 01:53:31.871
CONSIDERATION HAS TO GOING TO

01:53:31.938 --> 01:53:34.340
PLAY FOR THAT PROPONENTS OF THIS

01:53:34.407 --> 01:53:36.509
INITIATIVE I. DO DOES DOES THE

01:53:36.576 --> 01:53:38.745
INITIATIVE CONTINUE. IS THERE A

01:53:38.811 --> 01:53:41.414
BETTER LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVE

01:53:41.481 --> 01:53:43.049
WHICH WON AN.

THANK LOOK WHAT I UNDERSTAND

01:53:44.684 --> 01:53:46.052
THAT BETTER POLICY COMES FROM

01:53:46.119 --> 01:53:47.687
LEGISLATURE'S AND LEGISLATURE'S

01:53:47.754 --> 01:53:49.689
TAKEN A COW MORE CONSTITUENCIES

01:53:49.756 --> 01:53:50.990
THAT COURTS TO JUST BY

01:53:51.057 --> 01:53:52.258
DEFINITION FOR EXAMPLE IN THE

01:53:52.325 --> 01:53:53.993
COURT CASE. PROPERTY OWNERS WERE

01:53:54.060 --> 01:53:55.395
NOT ALLOWED.

01:53:55.461 --> 01:53:57.163
TO BE PART OF THE COURT CASE

01:53:57.230 --> 01:53:58.331
THEY WHAT WE TRIED TO ADD THEM

01:53:58.398 --> 01:54:00.066
TO THE CASE TO HAVE A SAY IN

01:54:00.133 --> 01:54:01.134
WHAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN WITH

01:54:01.201 --> 01:54:02.435
RESPECT TO A BIG IN PROGRAMS. OR

01:54:02.502 --> 01:54:04.304

THE CASE AND THE PLAINTIFFS

01:54:06.839 --> 01:54:08.308
JURISDICTIONS JOINED IN.

01:54:08.374 --> 01:54:10.009
OPPOSING THAT EFFORT SO THERE

01:54:10.076 --> 01:54:11.110
WERE CHANGES SO YES WE HAVE TO

01:54:11.177 --> 01:54:13.513
MAKE A DECISION. BUT THE MOST

01:54:13.580 --> 01:54:15.448
THE CORE PART OF THE INITIATIVE.

01:54:15.515 --> 01:54:18.017
IS TO NOT USE THE THAT THAT

01:54:18.084 --> 01:54:20.720
MONIKER OF PUBLIC NUISANCE.

01:54:20.787 --> 01:54:22.088
TO ADDRESS A HAZARD THAT THIS

01:54:22.155 --> 01:54:23.590
BODY HAD ALREADY DETERMINED HOW

01:54:23.656 --> 01:54:25.625
IT WAS DONE BUT ALSO TO PROVIDE

01:54:25.692 --> 01:54:27.327
FUNDING FOR SUBSTANDARD HOUSING

01:54:27.393 --> 01:54:29.796
THAT IS NECESSARY. IT IS THE IN

01:54:29.862 --> 01:54:32.065
THE IDEA IS AND I KNOW THAT IT'S

01:54:32.131 --> 01:54:33.666
BEING LOOKED AT AS A BAIL OUT

01:54:33.733 --> 01:54:34.968
BUT THE IDEA IS THAT EVERYONE

01:54:35.034 --> 01:54:37.036
AGREES MORE MONEY NEEDS TO BE

01:54:37.103 --> 01:54:39.005
PUT TOWARD SUBSTANDARD HOUSING.

01:54:39.072 --> 01:54:40.707
AND THE ADVANTAGES ARE CLEAR AND

01:54:40.773 --> 01:54:42.108
SO THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY

01:54:42.175 --> 01:54:44.143
WE LOOK AT IT THAT WAY. SO BUT I

01:54:44.210 --> 01:54:44.944
DON'T THINK YOU ANSWER MY

01:54:45.011 --> 01:54:46.579
QUESTION BECAUSE I'M UNCLEAR I

01:54:46.646 --> 01:54:48.047
RECOGNIZE YOU'RE LEAVING A LOT

01:54:48.114 --> 01:54:48.214

YOU'RE GONNA PURSUE INITIATIVE A

01:54:56.022 --> 01:54:57.056
BIGGER ARE YOU GONNA SIT DOWN.

01:54:57.123 --> 01:54:59.659
AS. JOHN WAS SAYING ABOUT TRYING

01:54:59.726 --> 01:55:02.128
TO WORK OUT A DEAL OR WORK OUT

01:55:02.195 --> 01:55:02.595
SOME LEGISLATIVE FIX.

01:55:02.662 --> 01:55:04.497
.

01:55:04.564 --> 01:55:05.265
I GUESS THE QUESTION WOULD BE

01:55:05.331 --> 01:55:06.799
THAT THE ASSEMBLY RECENTLY

01:55:06.866 --> 01:55:07.667

AB TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT OH THREE

01:55:10.970 --> 01:55:12.839
IN AB TWENTY SEVENTY THREE IS

01:55:12.905 --> 01:55:13.640

UP VASTLY WORKING WITH THE

01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:29.689
LEGISLATURE AND ONE OF THE FOLKS

WORKED ON AS WELL AS. WORK WE

01:55:33.793 --> 01:55:35.028
DID WITH THE FORMER CIVIL RIGHTS

SHE WORKED IN OPPOSE THESE KINDS

01:55:42.702 --> 01:55:43.703

01:55:44.804 --> 01:55:46.973
BREAK IT GAVE TO LANDLORDS BUT

01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:48.241
ONE OF THE THINGS SHE SAID TO ME

01:55:48.308 --> 01:55:49.542
ABOUT POLICY IS ONE OR NOTED

01:55:49.609 --> 01:55:51.944
QUOTES WAS IF THE TIME IS NOT

01:55:52.011 --> 01:55:52.578
RIGHT AND THAT'S RIGHT IN THE

01:55:52.645 --> 01:55:54.781
TIME. SO WE GOT DEADLINES BUT

01:55:54.847 --> 01:55:56.749
THAT'S ALL IT'S ALL THE TIME AND

01:55:56.816 --> 01:55:57.684
PLACE WHERE WE CAN TRY TO TRY TO

01:55:57.750 --> 01:55:59.686
ADDRESS THOSE AND WE'RE HAPPY TO

01:55:59.752 --> 01:56:01.054
CONSIDER ANY OPTIONS SO THE.

01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:03.056
INDIAN INDUSTRY IS FUNDING THE

01:56:03.122 --> 01:56:04.624
SIGNATURE GATHERING EFFORT AS

01:56:04.691 --> 01:56:05.892
THE FBI IN.

01:56:05.958 --> 01:56:07.427
AS A MEANS TO FURTHER

01:56:07.493 --> 01:56:10.296
LEGISLATIVE FIX IN THE CAPITAL.

01:56:10.363 --> 01:56:12.098
WELL WE'VE COLLECTED SIGNATURES

01:56:12.165 --> 01:56:13.599
BECAUSE THE INITIATIVE.

01:56:13.666 --> 01:56:16.336
IS ONE METHOD OF APPROACHING

01:56:16.402 --> 01:56:17.270
BUT YOU'LL ABANDONED RESOLUTELY

01:56:17.337 --> 01:56:19.072
TO TAKE ACTION.

01:56:19.138 --> 01:56:21.307
I I THINK IT WOULD BE CRAZY NOT

01:56:21.374 --> 01:56:23.276
TO THINK OF YOU HAVING THIS

01:56:23.343 --> 01:56:25.178
LEGISLATIVE BODY COME UP WITH A

01:56:25.244 --> 01:56:27.780
MORE ELEGANT SOLUTION. THEN

01:56:27.847 --> 01:56:28.648
OTHER ONES THAT ARE OUT THERE

01:56:28.715 --> 01:56:30.049
RIGHT NOW BUT THE BILLS THAT

01:56:30.116 --> 01:56:31.084
PASSED THE ASSEMBLY SO FAR NOT

01:56:31.150 --> 01:56:32.919
SATISFACTORY TO DENNIS.

01:56:32.985 --> 01:56:34.821
I'M I I KNOW OF TO AND I THINK

01:56:34.887 --> 01:56:36.522
IT'S ASSEMBLY MEN'S SHOES AND

01:56:36.589 --> 01:56:38.691
ASSEMBLY WOMAN MOANS.

01:56:38.758 --> 01:56:41.027
TWO DIFFERENT APPROACHES WHICH

01:56:41.094 --> 01:56:48.868
AGAIN ARE ONES OF THE LEAD TO

01:56:48.935 --> 01:56:49.535
THE ASSEMBLY I CHOSE TO PURSUE

01:56:49.602 --> 01:56:50.069
AND I KNOW AT LEAST WITH

01:56:50.136 --> 01:56:50.670
ASSEMBLY WOMAN'S LOW MOANS. IT

01:56:50.737 --> 01:56:51.337
BASICALLY CODIFIES THE IDEA OF

01:56:51.404 --> 01:56:51.971
USING PUBLIC NUISANCE SO WE

01:56:52.038 --> 01:56:52.205
THINK.

01:56:52.271 --> 01:56:53.139
SOME FOLKS BELIEVE THAT MAYBE

01:56:53.206 --> 01:56:55.274
IT SUFFERS THE SAME PROBLEMS OF

01:56:55.341 --> 01:56:56.509
PUBLIC NUISANCE WE'RE NOT HERE

01:56:56.576 --> 01:56:57.977
TO. ARGUE ABOUT THAT ARE NOT

01:56:58.044 --> 01:56:59.412
ASSEMBLY IS OBVIOUSLY AGREED

01:56:59.479 --> 01:57:01.013
WITH THAT AND AS WELL WITH.

01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:02.682
ASSEMBLY MEN CHOOSE THERE ARE A

01:57:02.749 --> 01:57:03.983
NUMBER. OF.

01:57:04.050 --> 01:57:05.651
PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES WE'D LIKE

01:57:05.718 --> 01:57:07.353
TO EXPLORE FIGURE OUT WHAT WORKS

01:57:07.420 --> 01:57:08.621
WITH THAT OR NOT.

01:57:08.688 --> 01:57:09.989
AGAIN NOT HERE TO ARGUE IT BUT

01:57:10.056 --> 01:57:10.790
WE WOULD.

01:57:10.857 --> 01:57:12.225
WE SEE THERE ARE NUMBER OF

01:57:12.291 --> 01:57:13.826
OPTIONS AND AGAIN THAT MOST

01:57:13.893 --> 01:57:15.528
ELEGANT OF SOLUTIONS COME FROM

01:57:15.595 --> 01:57:17.330
LEGISLATURE'S AND AGAIN IT'S THE

01:57:17.397 --> 01:57:18.898
ONLY STATE LEGISLATURE. THAT

01:57:18.965 --> 01:57:19.999
REALLY APPROACH THE ISSUE

01:57:20.066 --> 01:57:22.068
STARTING THREE DECADES AGO OR

01:57:22.135 --> 01:57:22.835
ALMOST THREE DECADES AGO

01:57:22.902 --> 01:57:24.103
WHEN I THINK THAT'S A FOUND

01:57:24.170 --> 01:57:25.671
POINT RELATIVE TO THE SUGGESTION

01:57:25.738 --> 01:57:26.439
THAT ARE ONGOING CONVERSATION IS

01:57:26.506 --> 01:57:28.174
WITH WHILE THIS IS GOING TO.

01:57:28.241 --> 01:57:29.909
XIN GOING ON FOR DECADES

01:57:29.976 --> 01:57:30.977
THE COURT IS RENDERED OF A

01:57:31.043 --> 01:57:32.745
DECISION YOU ARE WITHIN YOUR

01:57:32.812 --> 01:57:34.480
RIGHTS TO PURSUE AN APPEAL. I

01:57:34.547 --> 01:57:36.449
JUST FIND IT DIFFICULT TO ACCEPT

01:57:36.516 --> 01:57:37.850
THE USE OF OUR.

01:57:37.917 --> 01:57:40.620
PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATIC TOOLS TO

01:57:40.686 --> 01:57:42.655
EFFECTUATE REALLY WHAT IS A

01:57:42.722 --> 01:57:43.890
BUSINESS DECISION.

01:57:43.956 --> 01:57:45.291
AND I THINK TAKE IN THE CONTEXT

01:57:45.358 --> 01:57:46.859
THE COMMENTS ABOUT WHAT OTHERS

01:57:46.926 --> 01:57:47.660
ARE GETTING.

01:57:47.727 --> 01:57:49.362
AS RESULT OF THE SETTLEMENT OF

01:57:49.429 --> 01:57:51.898
WHEN YOU KNOW THE IF IF EVERY

01:57:51.964 --> 01:57:52.799
DOLLAR IS NOT GOING TO LEAD

01:57:52.865 --> 01:57:54.167
ABATEMENT. OR CERTAINLY EVERY

01:57:54.233 --> 01:57:55.568
DOLLAR BEING SPENT ON A

01:57:55.635 --> 01:57:57.437
SIGNATURE GATHERING EFFORT COULD

01:57:57.503 --> 01:57:58.504
CERTAINLY GO DEBATE.

01:57:58.571 --> 01:58:00.039
LET AND COMMUNITIES CORRECT I

01:58:00.106 --> 01:58:01.541
MEAN THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT

01:58:01.607 --> 01:58:02.141
THE TRIAL LAWYERS ARE GETTING

01:58:02.208 --> 01:58:03.342
THROUGH THEIR. THROUGH THEIR

01:58:03.409 --> 01:58:04.811
FEES ARE GOING TO PALE IN

01:58:04.877 --> 01:58:05.845
COMPARISON TO WHAT A SPINNAKER

01:58:05.912 --> 01:58:06.879
TELEVISION COMMERCIALS AND

01:58:06.946 --> 01:58:07.847
MAILERS AND THINGS OF THAT

01:58:07.914 --> 01:58:08.981
NATURE SO IT'S DIFFICULT AS A

01:58:09.048 --> 01:58:10.616
LEGISLATOR. TO FILL THE INDUSTRY

01:58:10.683 --> 01:58:12.218
SO IS ACTUALLY SERIOUS ABOUT

01:58:12.285 --> 01:58:13.719
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A SOLUTION

01:58:13.786 --> 01:58:14.921
ON IF THEY'RE ACTUALLY SPENDING

01:58:14.987 --> 01:58:16.355
MONEY ON THIS PARTICULAR EFFORT

01:58:16.422 --> 01:58:19.392
I REALIZE IT CREATES LEVERAGE.

01:58:19.459 --> 01:58:20.960
BUT THAT'S NOT A.

01:58:21.027 --> 01:58:21.327

01:58:46.285 --> 01:58:48.054
THERE'S INDIVIDUAL JEOPARDY.

01:58:48.120 --> 01:58:49.755
FOR HOMEOWNERS NO ONE UP HERE

01:58:49.822 --> 01:58:51.390

01:59:55.655 --> 01:59:56.889
THE OTHER THING I WOULD LIKE TO

01:59:56.956 --> 01:59:58.624
BRING UP IS THE IDEA THAT MISTER

02:00:26.919 --> 02:00:28.888
REQUIRES DISCLOSURE OF LEAD

02:00:28.955 --> 02:00:30.623
PAINT DURING HOME SALES SO THE

02:00:30.690 --> 02:00:32.058
RISK IS BEEN REFLECTED IN

02:00:32.124 --> 02:00:34.694
PROPERTY VALUES FOR YEARS.

02:00:34.760 --> 02:00:36.896
BARLOW ARE ALSO SAID IN THE

02:00:36.963 --> 02:00:38.431
CLOSING STATEMENT OF.

02:00:38.497 --> 02:00:41.067
NOVEMBER'S COURT DECISION UP

02:00:41.133 --> 02:00:42.702
THAT LED PAIN IN GENERAL IS

02:00:42.768 --> 02:00:45.471
BEING LABELED.

02:00:45.538 --> 02:00:46.839
A PUBLIC NUISANCE NOT THE

02:00:46.906 --> 02:00:48.608
PRESENCE OF LEAD PAINT IN

02:00:48.674 --> 02:00:51.043
INDIVIDUAL HOMES.

02:00:51.110 --> 02:00:52.411
IT'S DECEPTIVELY CALLED THE

02:00:52.478 --> 02:00:54.246
HEALTHY HOMES AND SCHOOLS ACTED

02:00:54.313 --> 02:00:56.315
TO TAXPAYER RIP RIP OFF SAID THE

02:00:56.382 --> 02:00:56.882
LA TIMES.

02:00:56.949 --> 02:01:00.252
LOOK.

02:01:00.319 --> 02:01:01.354
IT WILL BE PAID FOR THE

02:01:01.420 --> 02:01:02.188
TAXPAYERS BUT WE'RE NOT

02:01:02.254 --> 02:01:04.490
INCREASING.

02:01:04.557 --> 02:01:06.726
THE AMOUNT OF TAX THE TAXPAYERS

02:01:06.792 --> 02:01:08.561
ARE PAYING.

02:01:08.628 --> 02:01:09.895
MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE WHAT

02:01:09.962 --> 02:01:11.831
BONDS ARE BUT BASICALLY THEIR

02:01:11.897 --> 02:01:13.466
CALL ON THE GENERAL FUND IN THIS

02:01:13.532 --> 02:01:15.468
I SAID EARLIER.

02:01:15.534 --> 02:01:16.936
THIS MONEY IS GONNA COME AWAY

02:01:17.003 --> 02:01:18.137
FROM MONEY THAT MIGHT BE USED

02:01:18.204 --> 02:01:20.673
FOR HOMELESS.

02:01:20.740 --> 02:01:22.308
THAT MIGHT BE USED FOR OF

02:01:22.375 --> 02:01:24.010
MEDICAL CARE.

02:01:24.076 --> 02:01:25.778
THAT'S WHERE THIS MONEY WILL

02:01:25.845 --> 02:01:27.079
COME FROM IF THIS BOND MEASURES

02:01:27.146 --> 02:01:28.614
PASSED.

02:01:28.681 --> 02:01:31.250
.

02:01:31.317 --> 02:01:32.685
THE OTHER THING IS I CAN ONLY

02:01:32.752 --> 02:01:35.054
THINK THAT THE LAST STATEMENT OF

02:01:35.121 --> 02:01:36.522
THE STATE OF THE.

02:01:36.589 --> 02:01:38.924
.

02:01:38.991 --> 02:01:40.926
STATEMENT OF.

02:01:40.993 --> 02:01:42.895
UP PRESIDENT OBAMA IS TAKEN

02:01:42.962 --> 02:01:45.131
TERRIBLY OUT OF CONTEXT.

02:01:45.197 --> 02:01:46.999
WHAT HE WHAT I BELIEVE HE WAS

02:01:47.066 --> 02:01:48.234
TALKING ABOUT IS THAT WE

02:01:48.300 --> 02:01:50.036
SHOULDN'T?

02:01:50.102 --> 02:01:52.838
IDENTIFY KIDS WHO HAPPEN TO.

02:01:52.905 --> 02:01:54.807
IN A PARTICULAR TOWN.

02:01:54.874 --> 02:01:57.743
AS BAD KIDS OR HANDICAPPED KIDS

02:01:57.810 --> 02:02:00.012
HOWEVER.

02:02:00.079 --> 02:02:02.715
KIDS WHO WERE POISONED BY LEAD.

02:02:02.782 --> 02:02:05.151
CAN'T REVERSE THAT.

02:02:05.217 --> 02:02:07.753
ARM THE MOST YOU CAN DO IF A KID

02:02:07.820 --> 02:02:09.755
REALLY HAS A VERY HIGH LEAD

02:02:09.822 --> 02:02:11.590
LEVELS AND IN VERY TO TREAT FEW

02:02:11.657 --> 02:02:13.259
CASES THIS IS DONE YOU CAN TO

02:02:13.325 --> 02:02:15.027
CHEER LEADING. WHICH REMOVES LED

02:02:15.094 --> 02:02:16.862
FROM THE SYSTEM BUT THAT'S

02:02:16.929 --> 02:02:18.097
THAT'S RARELY DONE

02:02:18.164 --> 02:02:20.299
THE DAMAGE IS DONE ALREADY.

02:02:20.366 --> 02:02:22.301
AND WE KNOW WHAT IT DOES.

02:02:22.368 --> 02:02:24.270
AND IN FACT.

02:02:24.336 --> 02:02:26.739
ONE OF THE THEORIES OF WHY CRIME

02:02:26.806 --> 02:02:27.973
SUDDENLY WENT DOWN IN THE

02:02:28.040 --> 02:02:30.009
NINETIES IS BECAUSE IN NINETEEN

02:02:30.076 --> 02:02:31.777

CETERA.

02:02:35.147 --> 02:02:37.049
SO.

02:02:37.116 --> 02:02:38.918
I JUST WANNA SAY THAT I'VE NEVER

02:02:38.984 --> 02:02:41.053
HEARD SUCH DECEPTIVE THAMES.

A TESTIMONY MY LIFE.

02:02:43.289 --> 02:02:45.024

02:02:53.666 --> 02:02:55.534
.

02:02:55.601 --> 02:02:58.037

WHY DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THAT'S A

02:03:49.955 --> 02:03:52.825
GOOD IDEA AFTER THE COURTS?

OUT OF GENERAL FUNDS THERE FOR

02:04:21.320 --> 02:04:23.756

GENERAL FUND TO PAY FOR

02:04:38.904 --> 02:04:40.940
SOMETHING THAT THE COURTS.

02:04:41.006 --> 02:04:42.408
PACIFIC WE SAID SHOULD BE PAID

02:04:42.474 --> 02:04:44.844
FOR BY PETE COMPANIES.

BELIEVE IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO PUT

02:04:55.721 --> 02:04:57.189
THE TAXPAYERS. ON THE LINE FOR

02:04:57.256 --> 02:04:58.324

FROM THE DECISION THAT WAS MADE

02:05:20.579 --> 02:05:21.380
AND I DON'T THINK THAT IT WAS

02:05:21.447 --> 02:05:22.781
LEFT THAT AND WAS THOUGHT OF.

02:05:22.848 --> 02:05:24.049
HOLISTICALLY WHERE.

02:05:24.116 --> 02:05:25.885
THAT COULD BE WHERE IT SHOULD BE

02:05:25.951 --> 02:05:27.686
DONE IN A LEGISLATURE OR IN A

02:05:27.753 --> 02:05:28.621

BALLOT INITIATIVE THERE FOR THE

WHEN THEY GO VOTE SO SO YES IT

02:05:57.483 --> 02:05:57.683

IN MANY STATES IN MANY

02:06:14.967 --> 02:06:17.169
MUNICIPALITIES WERE ALL LOOKING

02:06:17.236 --> 02:06:18.003
AT WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO DO

02:06:18.070 --> 02:06:20.139
BOND ISSUES FOR TRANSPORTATION

02:06:20.205 --> 02:06:22.341
FOR EDUCATION. FOR AFFORDABLE

02:06:22.408 --> 02:06:26.078
HOUSING THE CITIZENS WILL MAKE A

CITIZEN.

02:07:33.879 --> 02:07:35.848
IS THE BEST WAY TO MAKE A

02:07:35.914 --> 02:07:36.815
DECISION WITH RESPECT TO THE TAX

02:07:36.882 --> 02:07:37.750
DOLLARS.

02:07:37.816 --> 02:07:39.785
AND IF.

02:07:39.852 --> 02:07:41.153
PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE

02:07:41.220 --> 02:07:42.421
UNINFORMED ABOUT THE COURT

02:07:42.488 --> 02:07:45.057
DECISION UNINFORMED ABOUT THE

02:07:45.124 --> 02:07:47.593
HAZARDS OF LEAD. WELL LET'S DO

02:07:47.659 --> 02:07:49.395
THAT AND THERE WAS ALWAYS THOSE

02:07:49.461 --> 02:07:49.628
THOSE.

02:07:49.695 --> 02:07:51.030
EDUCATIONAL.

02:07:51.096 --> 02:07:53.832
CAMPAIGNS THAT THIS IS WHAT IT

02:07:53.899 --> 02:07:55.434
IS PRO AND AGAINST.

02:07:55.501 --> 02:07:57.069
PEOPLE WILL IT WILL DECIDE

02:07:57.136 --> 02:07:59.104

IF IT FURTHERS THE INTERESTS OF

02:08:01.373 --> 02:08:03.709
THE STATE TO NOT ONLY INCLUDE.

LEAD BASED PAINT ABATEMENT.

AND OTHER THINGS I'M IN FULL

02:08:08.647 --> 02:08:10.616
AGREEMENT WITH THAT AND I THINK

02:08:10.682 --> 02:08:12.117
THAT THAT'S ONE OF OUR ARE THE

02:08:12.184 --> 02:08:13.585
DIFFERENCES AND YOU'VE SEEN IT

02:08:13.652 --> 02:08:14.753
YOU KNOW A NUMBER. IN A COUPLE

02:08:14.820 --> 02:08:17.389
OF THOSE MOVE FORWARD BUT AND. I

02:08:17.456 --> 02:08:18.057
MEAN THERE IS A BODY THAT DOES

02:08:18.123 --> 02:08:20.659
NOT FEEL. THAT THE GENERAL FUND

02:08:20.726 --> 02:08:22.628
OR THE TAXPAYER SHOULD BE. AND

02:08:22.694 --> 02:08:24.263
WHILE I RESPECT THE PERSPECTIVE

02:08:24.329 --> 02:08:27.232
YOU BRING ON. ANY YOU KNOW ALL

02:08:27.299 --> 02:08:28.867
PERSPECTIVES ARE ARE LISTEN TO I

02:08:28.934 --> 02:08:30.069
THINK THAT THAT IS A FUNDAMENTAL

02:08:30.135 --> 02:08:30.969
DIFFERENCE

02:08:31.036 --> 02:08:31.737
AND.

02:08:31.804 --> 02:08:34.473
THAT YOU KNOW EIGHTEEN YEARS I

02:08:34.540 --> 02:08:35.908
AM SOMEONE WHO WORKS FOR A

02:08:35.974 --> 02:08:36.975
PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT ANY

02:08:37.042 --> 02:08:38.677
COUNTY AND HAD THE OPPORTUNITY

02:08:38.744 --> 02:08:40.879
TO VISIT HOMES TO DO BI LINGUAL

02:08:40.946 --> 02:08:42.181
TRANSLATION.

02:08:42.247 --> 02:08:44.883
FOR AYE FAMILIES WHO WERE

02:08:44.950 --> 02:08:46.752
IMPACTED BY LEAD POISONING.

02:08:46.819 --> 02:08:49.121
AND THERE IS TRAINS THERE AND.

02:08:49.188 --> 02:08:50.823
WHAT I AM MOST TROUBLE THAT IS

02:08:50.889 --> 02:08:53.258
THAT THERE'S AN INCONSISTENCY IN

02:08:53.325 --> 02:08:53.959
WHAT THAT?

02:08:54.026 --> 02:08:56.361
PAINT COMPANIES ARE BRINGING TO

02:08:56.428 --> 02:08:57.396
S. IT WHAT WOULD BE THE BEST

02:08:57.463 --> 02:09:00.265
METHOD ON IN THE END THERE IT

02:09:00.332 --> 02:09:02.267
THIS IS YOU KNOW I THINK THE

02:09:02.334 --> 02:09:04.103
PUBLIC AT NEW SINCE ISSUE THAT'S

02:09:04.169 --> 02:09:05.337
BEEN BROUGHT UP IS.

02:09:05.404 --> 02:09:08.373
REALLY ONLY A TALKING POINT TO

02:09:08.440 --> 02:09:10.175
GET TO THE FACT THAT.

02:09:10.242 --> 02:09:14.313
WE HAVE A BALLOT INITIATIVE THAT

02:09:14.379 --> 02:09:16.081
E. SENSUALLY PUTTS CALIFORNIA

02:09:16.148 --> 02:09:18.283
TAXPAYERS.

02:09:18.350 --> 02:09:20.586
ON THE LINE FOR THREE POINT NINE

02:09:20.652 --> 02:09:23.222
BILLION DOLLARS.

02:09:23.288 --> 02:09:25.157
TWO BILLION IN THE PRINCIPLE AND

02:09:25.224 --> 02:09:26.859
ONE POINT NINE IN THE INTERESTS

02:09:26.925 --> 02:09:29.428
AND THAT IS A PROBLEM.

02:09:29.495 --> 02:09:33.031
AND SO I A. I DON'T KNOW HOW WE

02:09:33.098 --> 02:09:35.000
WILL TRY TO CONTINUE TO MOVE

02:09:35.067 --> 02:09:37.102
TOGETHER IF THAT BUNDLED IN

02:09:37.169 --> 02:09:38.070
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE IS NOT

02:09:38.137 --> 02:09:39.438
ADDRESSED.

02:09:39.505 --> 02:09:42.341

02:09:45.844 --> 02:09:47.646
AND IT WAS REALLY COMING FROM A

02:09:47.713 --> 02:09:50.382
PLACE OF. ON BELIEVING THAT THE

02:09:50.449 --> 02:09:52.651
COURTS HAD ALL THE EVIDENCE OVER

02:09:52.718 --> 02:09:53.552
EIGHTEEN YEARS.

02:09:53.619 --> 02:09:55.587

FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND

02:10:02.561 --> 02:10:04.029
I HOPE THAT THIS BODY WILL

02:10:04.096 --> 02:10:06.298
CONTINUE AS MEMBERS AS

02:10:06.365 --> 02:10:08.233

INTEREST OF CALIFORNIANS.

02:10:10.969 --> 02:10:12.538
BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE THAT

02:10:12.604 --> 02:10:14.873
HAVING THEM ON THE LINE WITHOUT

02:10:14.940 --> 02:10:17.042
ANY OF THE PAINT COMPANIES MEN

SO THE AS I MENTIONED BEFORE THE.

02:11:20.072 --> 02:11:21.540

02:11:21.607 --> 02:11:23.775
THE COURTS.

02:11:23.842 --> 02:11:25.811
RULING FROM THE APPELLATE COURT

02:11:25.877 --> 02:11:26.044

I WAS ASKED BY THE COMMITTEE

02:20:53.011 --> 02:20:54.779
TODAY TO OFFER MY PERSPECTIVES

02:20:54.846 --> 02:20:56.214
ON THE BURDEN OF LEAD POISONING

02:20:56.281 --> 02:20:59.050
IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. AND THE.

02:20:59.117 --> 02:21:00.685
THE ROLE OF LEATHER A LEAD

02:21:00.752 --> 02:21:02.086
PAINT ABATEMENT.

02:21:02.153 --> 02:21:03.354
LEAD POISONING HAS BEEN KNOWN.

02:21:03.421 --> 02:21:04.756
AS AN ENTITY FOR SINCE ANCIENT

02:21:04.823 --> 02:21:06.191
TIMES

02:21:06.257 --> 02:21:06.991
AND OVER THE PAST SEVERAL

02:21:07.058 --> 02:21:08.426
DECADES WE'VE MADE GREAT STRIDES

02:21:08.493 --> 02:21:10.695
TO REDUCE EXPOSURE TO VARIOUS

02:21:10.762 --> 02:21:11.162
SOURCES OF LEAD IN OUR

02:21:11.229 --> 02:21:12.397
ENVIRONMENT.

02:21:12.463 --> 02:21:13.932
DESPITE THESE EFFORTS LEAD

02:21:13.998 --> 02:21:14.933
POISONING REMAINS THE MOST

02:21:14.999 --> 02:21:15.400
IMPORTANT.

02:21:15.466 --> 02:21:17.101
PEDIATRIC ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH

02:21:17.168 --> 02:21:18.970
PROBLEM TODAY.

02:21:19.037 --> 02:21:19.370
I WAS.

02:21:19.437 --> 02:21:22.106
SIMILARLY PUZZLED BY THE USE OF

02:21:22.173 --> 02:21:25.176
THE QUOTE BY PRESIDENT OBAMA AND

02:21:25.243 --> 02:21:27.812
I WAS. LED TO BELIEVE THAT ALL

02:21:27.879 --> 02:21:28.780
YOU NEED IS LOVE.

02:21:28.847 --> 02:21:29.314
TO.

02:21:29.380 --> 02:21:31.583
TREAT LEAD POISONING AND.

02:21:31.649 --> 02:21:32.650
YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK THE

02:21:32.717 --> 02:21:34.018
BEATLES OR PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD

02:21:34.085 --> 02:21:35.687
THAT IN MIND BUT I THOUGHT THIS

02:21:35.753 --> 02:21:37.455
TROUBLE ACTUALLY DID BRING UP A

02:21:37.522 --> 02:21:38.523
VERY INTERESTING POINT WHICH WAS

02:21:38.590 --> 02:21:40.391
THAT. WHAT WE KNOW TODAY IS

02:21:40.458 --> 02:21:41.259
DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE KNEW

02:21:41.326 --> 02:21:42.560
BEFORE AND LET ME TELL YOU A

02:21:42.627 --> 02:21:44.395
LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WE DO KNOW

02:21:44.462 --> 02:21:46.865
TODAY? DESPITE THE REDUCTION IN

02:21:46.931 --> 02:21:48.399
AVERAGE BLOOD LEAD LEVELS OVER

02:21:48.466 --> 02:21:49.968
THE YEARS PEDIATRICIANS

02:21:50.034 --> 02:21:50.935
RIGHTFULLY HAVE A GROWING

02:21:51.002 --> 02:21:53.538
CONCERN ABOUT EMERGING RESEARCH.

02:21:53.605 --> 02:21:55.440
SHOWING MEASURABLE NEGATIVE

02:21:55.506 --> 02:21:57.642
HEALTH EFFECTS OF EVEN VERY LOW

02:21:57.709 --> 02:21:58.610
BLOOD LEAD LEVELS WHICH WE DID

02:21:58.676 --> 02:22:00.378
KNOW ABOUT BEFORE.

02:22:00.445 --> 02:22:01.713
THAT PARTICULARLY ON THE

02:22:01.779 --> 02:22:02.280
DEVELOPING BRAINS OF YOUNG

02:22:02.347 --> 02:22:04.482
CHILDREN. AND THESE INFECTS UP

02:22:04.549 --> 02:22:05.850
THESE EFFECTS INCLUDE I THINK

02:22:05.917 --> 02:22:07.318
YOU BROUGHT THIS UP MISTER CHIU

02:22:07.385 --> 02:22:08.553
IMPAIRED INTELLIGENCE OUT

02:22:08.620 --> 02:22:10.388
LEARNING DISABILITIES. BEHAVIOR

02:22:10.455 --> 02:22:13.925
ABNORMALITIES AMONG MANY OTHERS.

02:22:13.992 --> 02:22:14.592
PUBLIC HEALTH IS ABOUT

02:22:14.659 --> 02:22:16.394
PREVENTION.

02:22:16.461 --> 02:22:17.629
BUT PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS

02:22:17.695 --> 02:22:19.230
ARE ARE POORLY EQUIPPED.

02:22:19.297 --> 02:22:20.932
A FOCUS THEIR EFFORTS ON PRIMARY

02:22:20.999 --> 02:22:21.799
PREVENTION WHEN IT COMES TO LEAD

02:22:21.866 --> 02:22:23.167
POISONING.

02:22:23.234 --> 02:22:24.936
INSTEAD WE HAVE CHILDHOOD LEAD

02:22:25.003 --> 02:22:26.471
POISONING PREVENTION PROGRAMS

02:22:26.537 --> 02:22:28.306
WHICH ARE ACTUALLY LESS ABOUT

02:22:28.373 --> 02:22:29.707
PREVENTION AND INSTEAD ARE

02:22:29.774 --> 02:22:31.209
GEARED TOWARDS SECONDARY DISEASE

02:22:31.276 --> 02:22:32.644
SCREENING.

02:22:32.710 --> 02:22:33.978
SECONDARY DISEASE SCREENING

02:22:34.045 --> 02:22:35.713
INVOLVES A PEDIATRICIAN TESTING

02:22:35.780 --> 02:22:37.682
THE BLOOD OF CHILDREN AGES ONE

02:22:37.749 --> 02:22:39.717
AND TWO. TO LOOK FOR ELEVATED

02:22:39.784 --> 02:22:41.819
LEVELS OF LEAD IN THE BLOOD.

02:22:41.886 --> 02:22:42.921
WHEN AN ELEVATED LEAD LEVELS

02:22:42.987 --> 02:22:44.722
FOUND OUR DEPARTMENT DISPATCHES

02:22:44.789 --> 02:22:47.158
A TEAM. OF INSPECTORS IN PUBLIC

02:22:47.225 --> 02:22:48.927
HEALTH NURSES TO THE HOME.

02:22:48.993 --> 02:22:50.328
AND THE INSPECTORS SEEK TO

02:22:50.395 --> 02:22:50.962
DETERMINE THE SOURCE OF THE LEAD

02:22:51.029 --> 02:22:52.030
POISONING.

02:22:52.096 --> 02:22:53.765
THE NURSE EVALUATES THE CLINICAL

02:22:53.831 --> 02:22:55.566
STATUS OF THE CHILD TO IDENTIFY

02:22:55.633 --> 02:22:56.367
OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS WHO MAY BE

02:22:56.434 --> 02:22:58.469
AT RISK SUCH AS OTHER CHILDREN

02:22:58.536 --> 02:23:00.038
AND FEMALES OF CHILDBEARING AGE

02:23:00.104 --> 02:23:01.673
AND FACILITATE SECONDARY DISEASE

02:23:01.739 --> 02:23:02.507
SCREENING HER THOSE PEOPLE AS

02:23:02.573 --> 02:23:04.309
APPROPRIATE.

02:23:04.375 --> 02:23:06.945
THUS YOU CAN SEE THAT.

02:23:07.011 --> 02:23:08.813
WE WAIT.

02:23:08.880 --> 02:23:09.981
WE WAIT FOR A CHILD TO BECOME

02:23:10.048 --> 02:23:11.783
LEAD POISONED FIRST.

02:23:11.849 --> 02:23:13.851
AND THEN WE TAKE ACTION.

02:23:13.918 --> 02:23:15.320
AND THIS IS A PROCESS OF CATCH

02:23:15.386 --> 02:23:17.422
UP NOT PREVENTION.

02:23:17.488 --> 02:23:19.123
THESE IDENTIFIED PATIENTS HAVE

02:23:19.190 --> 02:23:20.792
ALREADY BEEN POISONED

02:23:20.858 --> 02:23:21.893
AND THE DAMAGE FROM LEAD

02:23:21.960 --> 02:23:23.861
POISONING HAS BEEN DONE OR IS

02:23:23.928 --> 02:23:24.762
BEING DONE AS THEY ARE

02:23:24.829 --> 02:23:27.432
IDENTIFIED.

02:23:27.498 --> 02:23:28.700
TREATING LEAD POISONING AFTER

02:23:28.766 --> 02:23:30.401
THE FACT IS A FAIRLY DIFFICULT

02:23:30.468 --> 02:23:32.003
TASK

02:23:32.070 --> 02:23:33.338
AND THE FIRST PART OF TREATMENT

02:23:33.404 --> 02:23:35.406
INVOLVES REMOVING THE CHILD FROM

02:23:35.473 --> 02:23:36.741
THE SOURCE OF LEAD POISONING TO

02:23:36.808 --> 02:23:38.443
AVOID FURTHER INJURY.

02:23:38.509 --> 02:23:39.944
BUT EVEN THAT HAS ITS PROBLEMS

02:23:40.011 --> 02:23:41.412
AS SOMETIMES A CHILD MAY BE

02:23:41.479 --> 02:23:43.247
REMOVED FROM THAT HOME. PLACED

02:23:43.314 --> 02:23:44.782
IN THE HOME OF ANOTHER FAMILY

02:23:44.849 --> 02:23:46.851
MEMBER AND THAT FAMILY MEMBER

02:23:46.918 --> 02:23:48.553
HAS A HOUSE THAT HAS LEAD PAINT

02:23:48.619 --> 02:23:49.821
AS WELL. SO THE INJURY MAY

02:23:49.887 --> 02:23:51.656
CONTINUE.

02:23:51.723 --> 02:23:52.724
BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT

02:23:52.790 --> 02:23:53.558
THERE IS LITTLE THAT CAN BE DONE

02:23:53.625 --> 02:23:55.293
FOR INJURY THAT MAY HAVE ALREADY

02:23:55.360 --> 02:23:57.562
OCCURRED.

02:23:57.628 --> 02:23:59.731
SO PEDIATRICIANS ARE HANDCUFFED

02:23:59.797 --> 02:24:01.299
SOMEWHAT BY THIS SECONDARY

02:24:01.366 --> 02:24:03.034
SCREENING DYNAMIC INTO SIMPLY

02:24:03.101 --> 02:24:05.703
MANAGING THE POTENTIAL LIFELONG.

02:24:05.770 --> 02:24:07.739
HEALTH EFFECTS OF LEAD POISONING

02:24:07.805 --> 02:24:10.108
ON CHILD LEARNING CHILD BEHAVIOR

02:24:10.174 --> 02:24:10.641
AND NUMEROUS OTHER HEALTH

02:24:10.708 --> 02:24:12.510
EFFECTS.

02:24:12.577 --> 02:24:13.978
SO PORTS PREVENTION IS WHERE WE

02:24:14.045 --> 02:24:15.346
SHOULD BE.

02:24:15.413 --> 02:24:16.647
AND THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO TREAT

02:24:16.714 --> 02:24:17.749
LEAD POISONING THAT'S THE BEST

02:24:17.815 --> 02:24:19.717
WAY TO TREAT IT. IS TO PREVENT

02:24:19.784 --> 02:24:20.318
IT FROM OCCURRING IN THE FIRST

02:24:20.385 --> 02:24:22.253
PLACE.

02:24:22.320 --> 02:24:23.187
AND THIS IS WHERE IT LEAD

02:24:23.254 --> 02:24:24.255
ABATEMENT.

02:24:24.322 --> 02:24:26.424
LEAD PAINT ABATEMENT COMES IN.

02:24:26.491 --> 02:24:27.458
LEAD PAINT IS THE FIRST AND

02:24:27.525 --> 02:24:28.993
FOREMOST BECAUSE OF OF LEAD

02:24:29.060 --> 02:24:30.161
POISONING IN U. S. CHILDREN

02:24:30.228 --> 02:24:31.896
TODAY.

02:24:31.963 --> 02:24:34.065
WHEN I TEACH MY STUDENTS AND MY

02:24:34.132 --> 02:24:35.533
MEDICAL RESIDENTS ABOUT LEAD

02:24:35.600 --> 02:24:37.135
POISONING I INFORMED THEM THAT.

02:24:37.201 --> 02:24:38.936
LED PAIN IS THE NUMBER ONE MOST

02:24:39.003 --> 02:24:40.238
COMMON REASON FOR LEAD POISONING

02:24:40.304 --> 02:24:41.773
IN CHILDREN.

02:24:41.839 --> 02:24:43.574
I ALSO TELL THEM THAT THE SECOND

02:24:43.641 --> 02:24:45.476
MOST COMMON REASON. IS LEAD

02:24:45.543 --> 02:24:47.011
PAINT AND THE THIRD MOST COMMON

02:24:47.078 --> 02:24:48.212
REASON.

02:24:48.279 --> 02:24:50.381
IS LEAD PAINT AND THE FOURTH

02:24:50.448 --> 02:24:52.083
FIFTH SIXTH SEVENTH EIGHTH NINTH

02:24:52.150 --> 02:24:54.652
AND TENTH MOST COMMON REASONS.

02:24:54.719 --> 02:24:56.854
CHILDREN BE POISONED BY LEAD.

02:24:56.921 --> 02:24:58.256
OUR LEAD PAINT AND AFTER THAT

02:24:58.322 --> 02:25:00.892
ALL THE OTHER KNOWN SOURCES OF

02:25:00.958 --> 02:25:02.560
LEAD DO CONTRIBUTE BUT YOU GET

02:25:02.627 --> 02:25:05.263
THE IDEA THAT LEAD PAINT IS. THE

02:25:05.329 --> 02:25:06.664
ELEPHANT IN THE LIVING ROOM AND

02:25:06.731 --> 02:25:08.466
FOR THAT MATTER IN EVERY OTHER

02:25:08.533 --> 02:25:10.601
ROOM WHERE LEAD PAINT MAY BE ON

02:25:10.668 --> 02:25:11.436
THE WALL.

02:25:11.502 --> 02:25:13.471
SO.

02:25:13.538 --> 02:25:14.939
I THINK WE WOULD ALL AGREE THAT

02:25:15.006 --> 02:25:15.907
THE NATURAL BEHAVIOR OF YOUNG

02:25:15.973 --> 02:25:17.608
CHILDREN.

02:25:17.675 --> 02:25:19.610
COUPLED WITH THE NATURAL

02:25:19.677 --> 02:25:21.312
DETERIORATION OF LEAD PAINT IS

02:25:21.379 --> 02:25:22.680
WHAT CREATES THIS SORT OF

02:25:22.747 --> 02:25:24.549
PERFECT STORM.

02:25:24.615 --> 02:25:26.017
BY WHICH CHILDREN ENCOUNTER

02:25:26.084 --> 02:25:27.718
CHIPS AND AND FLECKS OF LEAD

02:25:27.785 --> 02:25:29.620
PAINT EAT THEM AND ABSORB THEM

02:25:29.687 --> 02:25:31.322
INTO THE BODY.

02:25:31.389 --> 02:25:32.824
AND CHILDREN ARE ALSO AT RISK IN

02:25:32.890 --> 02:25:34.292
THE HOME FROM A MORE.

02:25:34.358 --> 02:25:36.127
HIDDEN PATHWAY OF LEAD PAINT

02:25:36.194 --> 02:25:37.428
EXPOSURE AND THAT'S IN THE FORM

02:25:37.495 --> 02:25:38.996
OF LEAD PAINT DUST

02:25:39.063 --> 02:25:40.798
WHICH IS RELATIVELY INVISIBLE TO

02:25:40.865 --> 02:25:42.400
THE MEMBER OF THE HOUSEHOLD. AND

02:25:42.467 --> 02:25:43.868
THAT IS LIBERATED FROM THE

02:25:43.935 --> 02:25:45.603
OPENING IN AND CLOSING OF DOORS

02:25:45.670 --> 02:25:48.773
AND THE AND WINDOWS.

02:25:48.840 --> 02:25:50.274
PREVENTION OF CHILDHOOD.

02:25:50.341 --> 02:25:52.677
LEAD EXPOSURE OR PROP CHILDHOOD

02:25:52.743 --> 02:25:53.911
EXPOSURE TO LEAD PAINT.

02:25:53.978 --> 02:25:57.415
CANNOT BE ACHIEVED BY CHANGING

02:25:57.482 --> 02:25:59.383
THE PHYSIOLOGY AND THE BEHAVIOR

02:25:59.450 --> 02:26:00.818
OF A ONE YEAR OLD CHILD.

02:26:00.885 --> 02:26:02.954
PREVENTION CAN ONLY OCCUR BY

02:26:03.020 --> 02:26:04.522
ELIMINATING THE SOURCE

02:26:04.589 --> 02:26:05.857
AND LED PAINT ABATEMENT OF

02:26:05.923 --> 02:26:07.425
COURSE IS THE WAY TO DO THAT.

02:26:07.492 --> 02:26:09.293
UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE ABILITY OF

02:26:09.360 --> 02:26:10.862
THE LOS CAN'T LOS ANGELES COUNTY

02:26:10.928 --> 02:26:12.497
PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO

02:26:12.563 --> 02:26:14.999
ABATE THE PROBLEM OF LEAD PAINT.

02:26:15.066 --> 02:26:16.334
GENERALLY COMES IN THE FORM OF

02:26:16.400 --> 02:26:18.469
OCCASIONAL SMALL GRANTS THAT WE

02:26:18.536 --> 02:26:20.605
GET TO MITIGATE A VERY VERY

02:26:20.671 --> 02:26:21.973
LIMITED NUMBER OF HOMES AT ANY

02:26:22.039 --> 02:26:23.641
GIVEN TIME.

02:26:23.708 --> 02:26:25.109
AND UNFORTUNATELY LOS ANGELES

02:26:25.176 --> 02:26:26.344
STILL HAS ONE OF THE OLDEST

02:26:26.410 --> 02:26:27.812
HOUSING STOCKS IN THE COUNTRY

02:26:27.879 --> 02:26:28.980
AND THERE ARE THOUSANDS UPON

02:26:29.046 --> 02:26:29.914
THOUSANDS OF HOMES IS STILL

02:26:29.981 --> 02:26:31.983
CONTAIN LEAD PAINT.

02:26:32.049 --> 02:26:34.852
UNTIL WE HAVE CONTROL. OVER THE

02:26:34.919 --> 02:26:37.255
PRIMARY SOURCE OF LEAD POISONING.

02:26:37.321 --> 02:26:39.290
WE MUST CONTINUE THIS.

02:26:39.357 --> 02:26:40.525
WHAT I THINK IS UNFORTUNATE

02:26:40.591 --> 02:26:42.493
PRACTICE OF RELYING ON SECONDARY

02:26:42.560 --> 02:26:43.594
DISEASE SCREENING OF THE BLOOD

02:26:43.661 --> 02:26:45.062
OF YOUNG CHILDREN TO DIAGNOSE

02:26:45.129 --> 02:26:46.197
AND TREAT LEAD POISONING AFTER

02:26:46.264 --> 02:26:48.499
HIS ALREADY OCCURRED?

02:26:48.566 --> 02:26:50.201
SO WE SHOULDN'T WAIT FOR DISEASE

02:26:50.268 --> 02:26:52.203
TO OCCUR BEFORE TREATING IT.

02:26:52.270 --> 02:26:54.005
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE DON'T HAVE TO.

02:26:54.071 --> 02:26:55.439
AND THE CORE PRINCIPLE OF PUBLIC

02:26:55.506 --> 02:26:57.942
HEALTH IS TO PREVENT DISEASE AN

02:26:58.009 --> 02:26:59.010
ABATEMENT OF LEAD PAINT IS THE

02:26:59.076 --> 02:27:01.479
KEY TO DOING THAT.

02:27:01.546 --> 02:27:03.548
ALL THAT BEING SAID.

02:27:03.614 --> 02:27:05.483
THIS PROPOSED INITIATIVE AS

02:27:05.550 --> 02:27:07.118
INDICATED BY THE TITLE ITSELF

02:27:07.185 --> 02:27:08.519
THAT ELIMINATES.

02:27:08.586 --> 02:27:09.554
LEAD PAINT COMPANIES

02:27:09.620 --> 02:27:10.588
RESPONSIBILITY TO SOLVE A HEALTH

02:27:10.655 --> 02:27:11.589
PROBLEM.

02:27:11.656 --> 02:27:13.591
THAT THEY CREATE.

02:27:13.658 --> 02:27:15.493
AND I I'M NO LAWYER BUT IT SEEMS

02:27:15.560 --> 02:27:17.828
TO ME THAT WE WE DIDN'T BURDEN

02:27:17.895 --> 02:27:18.696
TAXPAYERS WITH THE

02:27:18.763 --> 02:27:20.765
RESPONSIBILITY. TO ADDRESS ALL

02:27:20.831 --> 02:27:22.166
OF THE LUNG CANCERS THAT WERE

02:27:22.233 --> 02:27:23.901
CAUSED BY THE TOBACCO COMPANIES.

02:27:23.968 --> 02:27:25.303
AND I I DON'T FIND THIS

02:27:25.369 --> 02:27:26.971
SITUATION THAT MUCH DIFFERENT

02:27:27.038 --> 02:27:27.772
FROM FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH

02:27:27.838 --> 02:27:29.640
STANDPOINT.

02:27:29.707 --> 02:27:31.042
AND AS I UNDERSTAND OF THE JUDGE

02:27:31.108 --> 02:27:31.909
TOLD LETTING COMPANIES TO CLEAN

02:27:31.976 --> 02:27:33.711
UP THEIR MESS.

02:27:33.778 --> 02:27:35.179
AND THIS PROPOSED INITIATIVE.

02:27:35.246 --> 02:27:36.681
LOOKS A LITTLE BIT CONFUSING

02:27:36.747 --> 02:27:38.115
BECAUSE ON THE SURFACE IT LOOKS

02:27:38.182 --> 02:27:39.817
LIKE A GREAT IDEA TO CLEAN UP

02:27:39.884 --> 02:27:41.319
LEAD PAINT FROM HOMES BUT. IT'S

02:27:41.385 --> 02:27:43.287
NOT MADE CLEAR THAT THIS

02:27:43.354 --> 02:27:44.822
INITIATIVE IS AN ATTEMPT BY THE

02:27:44.889 --> 02:27:46.457
LEAD PAINT COMPANIES TO GET

02:27:46.524 --> 02:27:47.625
THEMSELVES OFF THE HOOK FOR A

02:27:47.692 --> 02:27:49.126
MESS THAT THE COURT'S ORDER THEM

02:27:49.193 --> 02:27:50.595
TO FIX.

02:27:50.661 --> 02:27:52.530
AND IT MAKES SENSE TO ME FROM A

02:27:52.597 --> 02:27:54.198
PUBLIC HEALTH STANDPOINT.

02:27:54.265 --> 02:27:55.399
TO HOLD THE LEAD PAINT COMPANY

02:27:55.466 --> 02:27:56.567
SET UP.

02:38:21.058 --> 02:38:22.192
SERIOUS IN A PAINT THE

02:38:22.259 --> 02:38:23.827
DISINTEGRATES AND IS BLOWN ABOUT

02:38:23.894 --> 02:38:25.696
BY THE WIND.

02:38:25.762 --> 02:38:27.698
NEVERTHELESS TEN YEARS AFTER

02:38:27.764 --> 02:38:28.599
WRITING OUT IN ITS OWN

02:38:28.665 --> 02:38:30.067
PUBLICATION.

02:38:30.133 --> 02:38:31.735
SURE WHEN WILLIAMS BOUGHT A LEAD

02:38:31.802 --> 02:38:33.637
MINE.

02:38:33.704 --> 02:38:35.138
WHICH IT USED TO MANUFACTURE

02:38:35.205 --> 02:38:36.840
LEAD CARBONATE PIGMENT FROM

02:38:36.907 --> 02:38:38.308
NINETEEN TEN TO NINETEEN FORTY

02:38:38.375 --> 02:38:41.111
SEVEN FOR USE IN ITS OWN PAINTS.

02:38:41.178 --> 02:38:42.412
SHERMAN WILLIAMS CONTINUE TO

02:38:42.479 --> 02:38:43.480
MAKE LEAD PAINT UNTIL NINETEEN

02:38:43.547 --> 02:38:45.482
FIFTY EIGHT.

02:38:45.549 --> 02:38:47.885
AND CONTINUE TO SELL LEAD PAINT

02:38:47.951 --> 02:38:50.120
UNTIL NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO.

02:38:50.187 --> 02:38:51.455
SIMILAR EVIDENCE HOW ABOUT THE

02:38:51.521 --> 02:38:52.923
COURT OF APPEAL SHOWED THAT EN

02:38:52.990 --> 02:38:54.291
EL AND CON AGRA.

02:38:54.358 --> 02:38:55.392
ALSO PROMOTED LEAD PAINT FOR

02:38:55.459 --> 02:38:56.927
DECADES.

02:38:56.994 --> 02:38:58.061
EVEN THOUGH THEY KNEW THAT IT

02:38:58.128 --> 02:38:59.897
WAS TOXIC AND THEY KNEW THAT IT

02:38:59.963 --> 02:39:01.965
WAS A POISON.

02:39:02.032 --> 02:39:03.800
NO WHERE IN THE DECISION BY THE

02:39:03.867 --> 02:39:05.702
COURT OF APPEAL.

02:39:05.769 --> 02:39:06.970
DID THE COURT OF APPEAL THE

02:39:07.037 --> 02:39:08.205
TRIAL COURT IT'S A RITUAL TO GO

02:39:08.272 --> 02:39:10.407
DUH JUDGMENT. DECLARE ANY

02:39:10.474 --> 02:39:12.109
SPECIFIC PROPERTY OR CATEGORY OF

02:39:12.175 --> 02:39:13.543
PROPERTIES TO BE A PUBLIC

02:39:13.610 --> 02:39:14.845
NUISANCE.

02:39:14.912 --> 02:39:16.780
AND THE REASON IS SIMPLE THE LAW

02:39:16.847 --> 02:39:18.982
SAYS YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

02:39:19.049 --> 02:39:20.851
SECTION THREE FOUR EIGHT ZERO OF

02:39:20.918 --> 02:39:23.353
THE CIVIL CODE SAYS AND I QUOTE.

02:39:23.420 --> 02:39:24.588
A PUBLIC NUISANCE IS SOMETHING

02:39:24.655 --> 02:39:25.889
INJURIES TO HEALTH THAT HERE'S

02:39:25.956 --> 02:39:28.091
THE QUOTE AFFECTS AT THE SAME

02:39:28.158 --> 02:39:29.793
TIME AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY OR

02:39:29.860 --> 02:39:31.929
NEIGHBORHOOD.

02:39:31.995 --> 02:39:33.964
PAIN IN A SPECIFIC HOUSE

02:39:34.031 --> 02:39:35.599
OR IN A SPECIFIC LOCATION OR ON

02:39:35.666 --> 02:39:36.967
A SPECIFIC PROPERTY DOES NOT

02:39:37.034 --> 02:39:38.702
AFFECT AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY AT

02:39:38.769 --> 02:39:40.037
THE SAME TIME AND IN THE SAME

02:39:40.103 --> 02:39:41.571
WAY.

02:39:41.638 --> 02:39:42.940
BUT THE DEFENDANT'S ACTIONS IN

02:39:43.006 --> 02:39:44.908
PROMOTING TOXIC AND POISONOUS

02:39:44.975 --> 02:39:47.544
PAIN. VERY CLEARLY DOES.

02:39:47.611 --> 02:39:49.479
AND I THINK THEY KNOW THIS.

02:39:49.546 --> 02:39:50.781
THE AUTHORS OF THE INITIATIVE

02:39:50.847 --> 02:39:52.549
THEMSELVES KNOW THIS THIS IS

02:39:52.616 --> 02:39:53.817
SOMETHING I THINK THAT WE'VE

02:39:53.884 --> 02:39:54.785
TALKED AROUND ABOUT THIS FOR A

02:39:54.851 --> 02:39:56.420
COUPLE HOURS. BUT WE HAVEN'T

02:39:56.486 --> 02:39:57.788
ACTUALLY LOOKED UP THE WORDS OF

02:39:57.854 --> 02:39:59.389
THE INITIATIVE ITSELF.

02:39:59.456 --> 02:40:01.158
AND HE WAS KIND ENOUGH TO

02:40:01.224 --> 02:40:02.726
PREPARE THIS IN HAND THIS OUT.

02:40:02.793 --> 02:40:03.860
PAGE THREE OF THEIR OWN

02:40:03.927 --> 02:40:07.364
STATEMENT OKAY PAGE THREE A ASKS

02:40:07.431 --> 02:40:08.999
THE OF THE INITIATIVE I'M ADDS

02:40:09.066 --> 02:40:09.599
THIS TO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY

02:40:09.666 --> 02:40:10.634
CODE.

02:40:10.701 --> 02:40:13.603
SECTION FIVE THREE NINE ONE ZERO

02:40:13.670 --> 02:40:16.373
SUBSECTION A LET ME QUOTE TO YOU.

02:40:16.440 --> 02:40:18.208
NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER LAW.

02:40:18.275 --> 02:40:20.911
LEAD BASED PAINT ON OR IN PUBLIC

02:40:20.978 --> 02:40:21.378
OR PRIVATE RESIDENTIAL

02:40:21.445 --> 02:40:23.780
PROPERTIES.

02:40:23.847 --> 02:40:25.482
WHETHER CONSIDERED INDIVIDUALLY.

02:40:25.549 --> 02:40:27.951
COLLECTIVELY OR IN THE AGGREGATE

02:40:28.018 --> 02:40:30.420
IS NOT A PUBLIC NUISANCE.

02:40:30.487 --> 02:40:31.755
FIRST OF ALL IT'S THE ONLY TIME

02:40:31.822 --> 02:40:33.890
THE WORD LEAD BASED PAINT OCCURS

02:40:33.957 --> 02:40:35.459
IN THE ENTIRE INITIATIVE.

02:40:35.525 --> 02:40:37.461
SECOND OF ALL.

02:40:37.527 --> 02:40:39.162
IF THEY WERE REALLY WORRIED

02:40:39.229 --> 02:40:40.497
ABOUT READ TAKING INDIVIDUAL

02:40:40.564 --> 02:40:42.332
HOUSES AND THAT WAS THE POINT OF

02:40:42.399 --> 02:40:44.101
THIS INITIATIVE. WHY DID THEY

02:40:44.167 --> 02:40:45.535
ADD THE WORDS COLLECTIVELY OR IN

02:40:45.602 --> 02:40:48.271
THE AGGREGATE?

02:40:48.338 --> 02:40:48.872
THAT'S REALLY THE PROBLEM THAT

02:40:48.939 --> 02:40:50.440
THEY'RE GETTING.

02:40:50.507 --> 02:40:51.641
COLLECTIVELY AND IN THE

02:40:51.708 --> 02:40:52.809
AGGREGATE BECAUSE THAT'S THE

02:40:52.876 --> 02:40:54.578
BASIS FOR THE LIABILITY BOTH OF

02:40:54.644 --> 02:40:55.645
THE TRIAL COURT AND THE COURT OF

02:40:55.712 --> 02:40:57.914
APPEAL.

02:40:57.981 --> 02:40:58.949
CALIFORNIA'S BEEN AT THE

02:40:59.016 --> 02:41:02.185
FOREFRONT OF RECOGNIZING LEAD IS

02:41:02.252 --> 02:41:02.686
A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS.

02:41:02.753 --> 02:41:04.488
IN TWO THOUSAND CHU THIS BODY

02:41:04.554 --> 02:41:06.723
ADDED SEVENTEEN NINE TWENTY

02:41:06.790 --> 02:41:08.425
POINT TEN TO THE BUSINESS AND

02:41:08.492 --> 02:41:09.860
PROFESSIONS CODE.

02:41:09.926 --> 02:41:11.595
THAT STATUTE DEFINES A LEAD

02:41:11.661 --> 02:41:13.597
HAZARD AND ESTABLISHES THAT ANY

02:41:13.663 --> 02:41:15.298
PROPERTY THAT HAS A LEAD HAZARD

02:41:15.365 --> 02:41:17.968
ON IT IS IN VIOLATION OF THE LAW.

02:41:18.035 --> 02:41:19.036
NAY FOR LOT FROM ATTORNEYS WHO

02:41:19.102 --> 02:41:21.204
TALK IN GENERAL TERMS ABOUT

02:41:21.271 --> 02:41:22.606
HOUSING POLICY.

02:41:22.672 --> 02:41:23.640
BUT NONE OF THEM DO CODE

02:41:23.707 --> 02:41:24.708
ENFORCEMENT WHERE THE KIND OF

02:41:24.775 --> 02:41:25.842
PEOPLE THAT THAT MONITOR ON A

02:41:25.909 --> 02:41:27.411
DAILY BASIS

02:41:27.477 --> 02:41:28.779
WHAT ARE FULL TIME EMPLOYEES DO

02:41:28.845 --> 02:41:30.847
RUNNING AROUND HOMES. AND

02:41:30.914 --> 02:41:32.649
FORCING OWNERS TO CLEAN THEM UP.

02:41:32.716 --> 02:41:34.384
IT IS A VERY CRUCIAL DISTINCTION

02:41:34.451 --> 02:41:36.653
BETWEEN LEAD IN A HOUSE THE

02:41:36.720 --> 02:41:38.255
PRESENCE OF LEAD PAINT. THAT'LL

02:41:38.321 --> 02:41:41.458
LEAD HAUSER ONLY A LEAD HAZARD

02:41:41.525 --> 02:41:43.493
IS ACTUALLY ACTIONABLE.

02:41:43.560 --> 02:41:44.494
AND IT REQUIRES TWO DIFFERENT

02:41:44.561 --> 02:41:45.896
THINGS FIRST OF ALL THE LEAD

02:41:45.962 --> 02:41:47.697
PAINT HAS TO BE DETERIORATED.

02:41:47.764 --> 02:41:48.732
THAT MEANS IT'S PEELING IT'S

02:41:48.799 --> 02:41:49.733
CHIPPING IT'S CRACKING IT

02:41:49.800 --> 02:41:51.668
SEPARATED FROM THE SURFACE.

02:41:51.735 --> 02:41:52.669
SECOND THE DETERIORATED

02:41:52.736 --> 02:41:53.904
CONDITION MUST BE MORE THAN

02:41:53.970 --> 02:41:56.306
MINIMAL IT HAS TO BE TO SQUARE

02:41:56.373 --> 02:41:57.974
FEET IN AN INTERIOR SPACE.

02:41:58.041 --> 02:41:59.242
OR TEN SQUARE FEET AND AN

02:41:59.309 --> 02:42:01.511
EXTERIOR SPACE.

02:42:01.578 --> 02:42:03.580
WE HAVE IT JUST THE OF VERY NICE

02:42:03.647 --> 02:42:04.347
EXAMPLE.

02:42:04.414 --> 02:42:07.350
OF THIS DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE

02:42:07.417 --> 02:42:07.918
PRESENCE OF LEAD AND A LEAD

02:42:07.984 --> 02:42:09.052
HAZARD.

02:42:09.119 --> 02:42:09.820
THE BUILDING WERE SITTING IN

02:42:09.886 --> 02:42:10.954
RIGHT NOW.

02:42:11.021 --> 02:42:13.190
EAST CAPITAL ANNEX.

02:42:13.256 --> 02:42:14.224
DESTRUCTIVE BETWEEN NINETEEN

02:42:14.291 --> 02:42:16.726
FORTY NINE NINETEEN FIFTY ONE.

02:42:16.793 --> 02:42:17.961
LEAD BASED PAINT WAS USED ON

02:42:18.028 --> 02:42:20.030
MANY MAYBE EVEN ALL OF THE

02:42:20.097 --> 02:42:21.531
INTERIOR SURFACES BECAUSE THAT

02:42:21.598 --> 02:42:23.333
WAS THE STANDARD TIME.

02:42:23.400 --> 02:42:24.267
NOW DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL

02:42:24.334 --> 02:42:25.802
SERVICES IN ITS REPORT FROM

02:42:25.869 --> 02:42:27.370
JANUARY OF TWENTY SIXTEEN HAD

02:42:27.437 --> 02:42:28.839
THIS TO SAY ABOUT THE BUILDING.

02:42:28.905 --> 02:42:31.141
THE CITY IT IS AGED OUTDATED

02:42:31.208 --> 02:42:33.977
INEFFICIENT AND DETERIORATED OF

02:42:34.044 --> 02:42:35.812
THOSE OF THOSE WORDS IS NOT MY

02:42:35.879 --> 02:42:36.746
WORDS AS THE WORDS OF THE.

02:42:36.813 --> 02:42:38.815
THE THE DDS.

02:42:38.882 --> 02:42:40.050
THE REPORT NOTED THE PRESENCE OF

02:42:40.117 --> 02:42:41.051
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS INCLUDING P.

02:42:41.118 --> 02:42:42.519
C. B.'S.

02:42:42.586 --> 02:42:44.221
IT'S BEST THIS AND YES LEAD

02:42:44.287 --> 02:42:46.056
BASED PAINT BUT THE CAPITAL

02:42:46.123 --> 02:42:48.058
ANNEX HAS NOT BEEN RED TAGGED.

02:42:48.125 --> 02:42:48.925
NOT BY THE COURT OF APPEAL NOT

02:42:48.992 --> 02:42:50.360
FOR ANYBODY ELSE.

02:42:50.427 --> 02:42:51.995
AND REST ASSURED THE STATE

02:42:52.062 --> 02:42:53.563
LEGISLATURE IS NOT OPERATING A

02:42:53.630 --> 02:42:55.132
PUBLIC HAZARD

02:42:55.198 --> 02:42:55.832
AND YOU'RE NOT OPERATING A

02:42:55.899 --> 02:42:58.435
PUBLIC NUISANCE.

02:42:58.502 --> 02:42:59.769
ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IS JUST

02:42:59.836 --> 02:43:02.038
IT'S JUST FLAT WRONG.

02:43:02.105 --> 02:43:03.807
ONLY IN LEAD HAZARD ACTUALLY

02:43:03.874 --> 02:43:04.374
DIMINISHES THE VALUE OF THE

02:43:04.441 --> 02:43:05.709
HOUSE

02:43:05.775 --> 02:43:07.277
AND CAN ONLY A LEAD HAZARD

02:43:07.344 --> 02:43:08.712
CONSERVE AS THE BASIS FOR A CODE

02:43:08.778 --> 02:43:10.614
VIOLATION.

02:43:10.680 --> 02:43:11.781
NOTHING IN THE COURT OF APPEALS

02:43:11.848 --> 02:43:13.283
DECISION CHANGES THAT.

02:43:13.350 --> 02:43:14.751
THAT WAS THE EXISTING LAW THAT

02:43:14.818 --> 02:43:16.286
IS THE EXISTING LAW NOTHING IN

02:43:16.353 --> 02:43:19.589
THE INITIATIVE CHANGES THAT.

02:43:19.656 --> 02:43:20.924
THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO HAS BEEN

02:43:20.991 --> 02:43:22.125
AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE LEAD

02:43:22.192 --> 02:43:23.093
PAINT CREEK HEALTH CRISIS AS

02:43:23.160 --> 02:43:24.861
WELL IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT

02:43:24.928 --> 02:43:25.762
THE CITY PASSED ONE OF THE

02:43:25.829 --> 02:43:26.930
STRONGEST LOCAL ORDINANCES IN

02:43:26.997 --> 02:43:28.231
THE COUNTRY.

02:43:28.298 --> 02:43:29.466
TO EMPOWER ITS CORDON CODE

02:43:29.533 --> 02:43:30.834
ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS TO

02:43:30.901 --> 02:43:31.401
IDENTIFY AND REMEDIATE LEAD

02:43:31.468 --> 02:43:33.103
HAZARDS.

02:43:33.170 --> 02:43:34.871
AND I'M I'M SORRY THAT ASSEMBLY

02:43:34.938 --> 02:43:36.339
MEMBER MAIENSCHEIN IS NOT HERE

02:43:36.406 --> 02:43:37.607
HE WAS ON THE SAN DIEGO CITY

02:43:37.674 --> 02:43:39.709
COUNCIL AT THE TIME HE WAS ONE

02:43:39.776 --> 02:43:40.310
OF THE VOTES THAT THAT HELPED

02:43:40.377 --> 02:43:42.712
PASS THAT IN IMPORTANT ORDINANCE.

02:43:42.779 --> 02:43:43.914
AND I THINK YOU SHOULD PROBABLY

02:43:43.980 --> 02:43:45.582
TAKE CREDIT FOR WHAT HE DID. THE

02:43:45.649 --> 02:43:46.483
SENATE PRO TEM OF THE

02:43:46.550 --> 02:43:48.218
LEGISLATURE WAS ALSO A MEMBER OF

02:43:48.285 --> 02:43:49.786
THIS OF THE CITY COUNCIL SAN

02:43:49.853 --> 02:43:51.021
DIEGO.

02:43:51.087 --> 02:43:52.122
AT THAT TIME AND SHE ALSO HELP

02:43:52.189 --> 02:43:53.924
PASS THAT WORD.

02:43:53.990 --> 02:43:55.892
THE ORDINANCE HAS BEEN A MODEL

02:43:55.959 --> 02:43:56.459
FOR JURISDICTIONS ACROSS THE

02:43:56.526 --> 02:43:58.128
COUNTRY.

02:43:58.195 --> 02:43:59.296
AND WE ARE VERY PROUD OF THE

02:43:59.362 --> 02:44:00.564
WORK OUR EMPLOYEES HAVE DONE AND

02:44:00.630 --> 02:44:02.632
CONTINUE TO DO. BOTH DIRECTLY

02:44:02.699 --> 02:44:03.600
AND BY TRAINING OTHERS TO BE

02:44:03.667 --> 02:44:05.202
CERTIFIED.

02:44:05.268 --> 02:44:06.336
CREATE A WORK FORCE THAT CAN

02:44:06.403 --> 02:44:09.773
HANDLE THESE ABATEMENT ISSUES.

02:44:09.839 --> 02:44:10.974
BUT THE FINAL WE JUST ADDRESS

02:44:11.041 --> 02:44:12.075
ONE WORD ABOUT THE TRIAL

02:44:12.142 --> 02:44:13.743
ATTORNEYS.

02:44:13.810 --> 02:44:14.878
UP THE TRIAL ATTORNEYS WERE

02:44:32.062 --> 02:44:32.996
I DON'T THINK EITHER ONE OF THEM

02:44:33.063 --> 02:44:34.864
COULD BE DESCRIBED AS A PUSHOVER.

02:44:34.931 --> 02:44:35.899
IT BY NO MEANS THAT THEY

02:44:35.966 --> 02:44:37.234

NONE OF THE JUDGE NONE OF THE

02:44:55.185 --> 02:44:56.086

02:44:56.152 --> 02:44:58.255

FOR THEIR OWN ACTIONS.

02:45:42.899 --> 02:45:43.967

AND WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO

02:50:32.822 --> 02:50:34.557
OUR CASE.

02:50:34.624 --> 02:50:36.526
WHEN WE JUST.

02:50:36.593 --> 02:50:37.760
CONTINUE ON FOR THE FINAL

PRESENTATIONS OF LIKE TO TURN

02:50:39.796 --> 02:50:40.697
OVER TO THE GOOD DOCTOR DR

BILL MUCH ACTION CURRENTLY THE

02:50:48.738 --> 02:50:50.373
HEALTH OFFICER. NEWTON SEES ME

02:50:50.440 --> 02:50:51.507
AND DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC HEALTH

02:50:51.574 --> 02:50:53.042
FOR SOLANO COUNTY. AND I'VE BEEN

02:50:53.109 --> 02:50:54.110
INVOLVED IN DOING THE CHILDHOOD

02:50:54.177 --> 02:50:55.411
LEAD ISSUES FOR THE FULL THIRTY

02:50:55.478 --> 02:50:56.679
YEARS OF MY CAREER AS A PUBLIC

02:50:56.746 --> 02:50:58.481
HEALTH OFFICIAL. TESTIFIED IN A

02:50:58.548 --> 02:50:59.549
SIMILAR TRIAL IN RHODE ISLAND

02:50:59.616 --> 02:51:01.584
TESTIFIED AT THIS TRIAL SERVED

02:51:01.651 --> 02:51:02.986
ON THE CDC'S CHILDHOOD LEAD

02:51:03.052 --> 02:51:04.287
POISONING PREVENTION ADVISORY

02:51:04.354 --> 02:51:05.922
COMMITTEE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS.

02:51:05.989 --> 02:51:07.523
SO I CAN SPEAK.

02:51:07.590 --> 02:51:09.726
I THINK WROTE WITH RELATIVE.

02:51:09.792 --> 02:51:12.161
CERTAINTY ABOUT ABOUT THE HARMS

02:51:12.228 --> 02:51:14.130
THAT LED CAUSES TO THE CHILDREN

02:51:14.197 --> 02:51:16.466
IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND AND AND I

02:51:16.532 --> 02:51:17.667
THINK WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT A

02:51:17.734 --> 02:51:19.002
FAIR BIT YOU ALL APPEAR TO BE

02:51:19.068 --> 02:51:20.370
ACTUALLY QUITE WELL VERSED ON

02:51:20.436 --> 02:51:22.271
THESE ISSUES ARE SIMPLY

02:51:22.338 --> 02:51:22.739
REITERATE THE FACTS.

02:51:22.805 --> 02:51:24.273
THAT.

02:51:24.340 --> 02:51:25.508
CHILDREN WERE POISONED EVEN AT

02:51:25.575 --> 02:51:27.844
VERY LOW LEVELS OF LEAD SUSTAIN

02:51:27.910 --> 02:51:29.312
MEANINGFUL SIGNIFICANT

02:51:29.379 --> 02:51:30.613
NEUROLOGIC IMPACTS THAT ARE

02:51:30.680 --> 02:51:32.382
PERMANENT THERE IS NO SAFE LEVEL

02:51:32.448 --> 02:51:34.417
OF EXPOSURE TO LEAD THE HARM

02:51:34.484 --> 02:51:36.386
THAT'S CAUSED CANNOT BE TREATED.

02:51:36.452 --> 02:51:38.988
WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE PRIMARY

02:51:39.055 --> 02:51:41.424
SOURCE OF EXPOSURE OF LEAD TO TO

02:51:41.491 --> 02:51:43.660
FOR CHILDREN TO LEAD IS PAIN

02:51:43.726 --> 02:51:45.194
THAT'S BEEN NOTED MULTIPLE TIMES.

02:51:45.261 --> 02:51:46.629
AND THE CHILDREN BECOME EXPOSED

02:51:46.696 --> 02:51:47.530
BY BEING NOTHING MORE THAN

02:51:47.597 --> 02:51:48.965
CHILDREN AS TO THEIR NORMAL

02:51:49.032 --> 02:51:50.333
ACTIVITIES OF CHILDHOOD THAT

02:51:50.400 --> 02:51:51.701
THEY BECOME EXPOSED TO LEAD IN

02:51:51.768 --> 02:51:53.603
THE HOME.

02:51:53.670 --> 02:51:55.338
IN IN MY COUNTY INSULIN ACCOUNT

02:51:55.405 --> 02:51:56.673
WE HAVE A POPULATION OF ONLY

02:51:56.739 --> 02:51:57.540
ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY

02:51:57.607 --> 02:51:58.908
THOUSAND. PEOPLE SO WERE

02:51:58.975 --> 02:52:00.309
APPROXIMATELY ONE PERCENT OF THE

02:52:00.376 --> 02:52:01.644
STATE BUT IN THAT COUNTY.

02:52:01.711 --> 02:52:04.747
WE HAVE FIFTEEN THOUSAND HOMES

02:52:04.814 --> 02:52:05.581
THAT WERE BUILT BEFORE NINETEEN

02:52:05.648 --> 02:52:07.417
FIFTY AND WE HAVE SIXTY FIVE

02:52:07.483 --> 02:52:09.752
pSEVENTY EIGHT ALL OF WHICH MAY

02:52:09.819 --> 02:52:10.753
CONTAIN LEAD AND EXPOSE OUR

02:52:10.820 --> 02:52:11.988
CHILDREN.

02:52:12.055 --> 02:52:13.723
THE PROOF OF THE FACT THAT THIS

02:52:13.790 --> 02:52:15.058
CONTINUES TO BE AN ONGOING

02:52:15.124 --> 02:52:17.226
PROBLEM IS THAT WE FOR THE LAST

02:52:17.293 --> 02:52:18.895
THREE OR FOUR YEARS HAVE HAD.

02:52:18.961 --> 02:52:20.563
EIGHTY FIVE CHILDREN ON AVERAGE

02:52:20.630 --> 02:52:22.098
REPORTED TO US WITH ELEVATED

02:52:22.165 --> 02:52:23.766
BLOOD LEAD LEVELS NOW ONLY ABOUT

02:52:23.833 --> 02:52:25.368
A THIRD TO A SIXTH OF THE

02:52:25.435 --> 02:52:27.370
CHILDREN ARE TESTED. AND SO YOU

02:52:27.437 --> 02:52:29.305
CAN SEE YOU CAN CLEARLY MULTIPLY

02:52:29.372 --> 02:52:30.239
THAT VALUE BY THREE TO SIX TO

02:52:30.306 --> 02:52:32.175
GET A TRUER VALUE OF THE NUMBER

02:52:32.241 --> 02:52:33.209
OF CHILDREN THAT ARE BEING

02:52:33.276 --> 02:52:35.745
POISONED TODAY. IN SOLANO COUNTY

02:52:35.812 --> 02:52:37.213
AND YOU CAN CLEARLY EXTRAPOLATE

02:52:37.280 --> 02:52:38.681
THAT TO THE STATE.

02:52:38.748 --> 02:52:41.217
AS AS AS HAD BEEN NOTED EARLIER

02:52:41.284 --> 02:52:42.985
IN CALIFORNIA TENSOF THOUSANDS

02:52:43.052 --> 02:52:44.754
OF CHILDREN ARE POISONED BY LEAD

02:52:44.821 --> 02:52:46.122
EVERY YEAR EVEN TODAY THE

02:52:46.189 --> 02:52:47.757
PROBLEM REMAINS BECAUSE THE

02:52:47.824 --> 02:52:49.792
PROBLEM NEEDS TO BE INVADED FOR

02:52:49.859 --> 02:52:51.227
THE PROBLEM TO GO AWAY.

02:52:51.294 --> 02:52:52.328
THE IMPACT OF CHILDREN AND THEIR

02:52:52.395 --> 02:52:53.629
FAMILIES ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY

02:52:53.696 --> 02:52:55.331
POOR. THE RISKS FOR LEAD

02:52:55.398 --> 02:52:57.533
POISONING OUR GREATEST IN OLD IN

02:52:57.600 --> 02:52:58.668
OLDER LESS WELL MAINTAINED

02:52:58.735 --> 02:52:59.902
COMMUNITIES OFTEN IN MULTI UNIT

02:52:59.969 --> 02:53:02.605
RENTAL DWELLINGS.

02:53:02.672 --> 02:53:03.873
WHEN WE LEARNED OF A CHILD WITH

02:53:03.940 --> 02:53:04.974
AN ELEVATED BLOOD LEAD LEVEL OUR

02:53:05.041 --> 02:53:06.509
PRIMARY GOAL IS LOCAL PUBLIC

02:53:06.576 --> 02:53:07.977
HEALTH OFFICIALS IS TO PREVENT

02:53:08.044 --> 02:53:09.412
FURTHER EXPOSURE TO LET.

02:53:09.479 --> 02:53:10.847
AND WE DO THAT BECAUSE AGAIN

02:53:10.913 --> 02:53:11.881
THERE IS NO TREATMENT FOR THE

02:53:11.948 --> 02:53:13.015
DAMAGE THAT'S BEEN CAUSED FOR

02:53:13.082 --> 02:53:14.650
THAT CHILD.

02:53:14.717 --> 02:53:16.085
SO WE WORK WITH FAMILIES OF THE

02:53:16.152 --> 02:53:17.353
LEAD POLLUTION CHILD. TO

02:53:17.420 --> 02:53:18.488
IDENTIFY THE SOURCE OR THE

02:53:18.554 --> 02:53:20.456
SOURCES OF EXPOSURE AND TO

02:53:20.523 --> 02:53:21.057
ELIMINATE OR AT LEAST CONTROL

02:53:21.124 --> 02:53:22.625
THOSE.

02:53:22.692 --> 02:53:23.493
AND FOR CHILDREN WHO HAVE

02:53:23.559 --> 02:53:24.894
SUSTAIN NEUROLOGIC DAMAGE THE

02:53:24.961 --> 02:53:26.062
ONLY RECOURSE IS ADAPTIVE

02:53:26.129 --> 02:53:27.764
THERAPY THEY REQUIRE SPECIAL

02:53:27.830 --> 02:53:29.332
EDUCATION ASSISTANCE AND OTHER

02:53:29.398 --> 02:53:30.967
TYPES OF THERAPEUTIC ASSISTANCE.

02:53:31.033 --> 02:53:32.268
BECAUSE THEY NOW HAVE TO ADAPT

02:53:32.335 --> 02:53:33.936
TO THE FACT THAT THEY ARE LESS

02:53:34.003 --> 02:53:34.504
CAPABLE THAN THEY WOULD HAVE

02:53:34.570 --> 02:53:36.072
BEEN OTHERWISE.

02:53:36.139 --> 02:53:37.940
SO GIVEN THAT THE DAMAGE TERM

02:53:38.007 --> 02:53:38.841
BECAUSE THE CHILDREN'S RINGS IS

02:53:38.908 --> 02:53:40.109
PERMANENT AND THERE IS NO SAFE

02:53:40.176 --> 02:53:41.511
LEVEL OF EXPOSURE THE ONLY

02:53:41.577 --> 02:53:42.478
REASONABLE COURSE OF ACTION IS

02:53:42.545 --> 02:53:44.147
PREVENTION. AND WHEN IT COMES TO

02:53:44.213 --> 02:53:47.617
LEADED PAINT PREVENTION IS A BIG.

02:53:47.683 --> 02:53:49.352
TOM I THINK THAT AT PRESENT IT'S

02:53:49.418 --> 02:53:51.220
VERY SAD TO ACCEPT THE FACT THAT

02:53:51.287 --> 02:53:53.055
WE ONLY LEARN ABOUT LEAD HAZARDS

02:53:53.122 --> 02:53:54.056
IN HOMES BECAUSE CHILDREN BECOME

02:53:54.123 --> 02:53:55.224
POISONED THEY COME TO OUR

02:53:55.291 --> 02:53:56.159
ATTENTION HAVING ALREADY BEEN

02:53:56.225 --> 02:53:57.794
HARMED.

02:53:57.860 --> 02:53:59.162
AND WHAT WE THEN DO IS SEND OUR

02:53:59.228 --> 02:54:00.296
ENVIRONMENT SPECIALIST TO

02:54:00.363 --> 02:54:01.697
INSPECT THE HOUSE THEY TEST THE

02:54:01.764 --> 02:54:03.432
INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR PAINT THEY

02:54:03.499 --> 02:54:04.467
LOOK FOR OTHER NO SOURCES OF

02:54:04.534 --> 02:54:06.169
LEAD. THE SOIL MAY ALSO BE

02:54:06.235 --> 02:54:08.137
TESTED IF IT'S APPROPRIATE. IF

02:54:08.204 --> 02:54:09.505
ONE IS DETECTED IN THE PAINT OR

02:54:09.572 --> 02:54:10.673
AT THAT WERE IN THE SOIL AT

02:54:10.740 --> 02:54:11.440
LEVELS ABOVE THE REGULATORY

02:54:11.507 --> 02:54:13.776
STANDARD. THAN APPROPRIATE

02:54:13.843 --> 02:54:14.744
PAYMENT IS RECOMMENDED.

02:54:14.811 --> 02:54:16.512
ENFORCEMENT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

02:54:16.579 --> 02:54:18.314
IS IN THE FORM OF EDUCATION AND

02:54:18.381 --> 02:54:19.482
ASSISTANCE WITH AMAZEMENT WE

02:54:19.549 --> 02:54:20.917
DON'T PUNISH.

02:54:20.983 --> 02:54:22.318
OUR GOAL IS TO HELP RESOLVE THE

02:54:22.385 --> 02:54:23.553
ISSUE.

02:54:23.619 --> 02:54:24.854
AFFECTED FAMILIES ARE GIVEN

02:54:24.921 --> 02:54:26.022
INFORMATION ABOUT A BEING THE

02:54:26.088 --> 02:54:26.923
MESSAGES ABOUT BEING A

02:54:26.989 --> 02:54:28.191
PROFESSIONALS AND WE TRY TO

02:54:28.257 --> 02:54:29.559
ASSIST THEM WITH ACCESS TO

02:54:29.625 --> 02:54:30.793
FINANCIAL SUPPORT.

02:54:30.860 --> 02:54:32.128
WE ALSO TRY TO ASSIST THEM WITH

02:54:32.195 --> 02:54:33.162
TEMPORARY RELOCATION DURING THE

02:54:33.229 --> 02:54:35.198
ABATEMENT PROCESS.

02:54:35.264 --> 02:54:36.933
A PAYMENT CAN BE VERY EXPENSIVE

02:54:36.999 --> 02:54:38.534
AND AN OLDER VICTORIAN BUILT IN

02:54:38.601 --> 02:54:39.602
THE NINETEEN FORTIES OR FIFTIES

02:54:39.669 --> 02:54:41.170
IN COST FORTY OR FIFTY THOUSAND

02:54:41.237 --> 02:54:42.805
DOLLARS TO INVADE A HOME THAT

02:54:42.872 --> 02:54:44.974
COSTS ARE NOT TRIVIAL. AND GIVEN

02:54:45.041 --> 02:54:46.175
THAT SO MANY OF THE IMPACT THEIR

02:54:46.242 --> 02:54:48.144
FAMILIES ARE POOR CONTAINMENT

02:54:48.211 --> 02:54:49.512
AND OTHER NON PERMANENT HAVE

02:54:49.579 --> 02:54:50.646
EVEN METHODS ARE OFTEN WHAT WE

02:54:50.713 --> 02:54:52.181
HAVE TO RELY ON. INSISTS

02:54:52.248 --> 02:54:53.216
RESULTING ABATEMENT IS

02:54:53.282 --> 02:54:55.585
ESSENTIALLY ONLY A TEMPORARY FIX

02:54:55.651 --> 02:54:56.519
THE HAZARD PERSISTS.

02:54:56.586 --> 02:54:58.054
AND SO GENERATION AFTER

02:54:58.120 --> 02:54:59.155
GENERATION OF CHILDREN CONTINUE

02:54:59.222 --> 02:55:01.023
TO BE EXPOSED TO THE LET.

02:55:01.090 --> 02:55:02.692
SO AGAIN OUR GOAL IN THESE CASES

02:55:02.758 --> 02:55:04.060
OF HELP ACHIEVE ABATEMENT NOT TO

02:55:04.126 --> 02:55:05.628
PUNISH WE DON'T USE LEANS

02:55:05.695 --> 02:55:07.163
AGAINST PROPERTY WE DON'T READ

02:55:07.230 --> 02:55:08.564
TAG THE RESIDENTS WE DON'T HAVE

02:55:08.631 --> 02:55:09.699
IT TENANTS ARE OCCUPANTS THERE'S

02:55:09.765 --> 02:55:11.701
NO. THERE'S SIMPLY NO POINT TO

02:55:11.767 --> 02:55:12.735
THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH OUR

02:55:12.802 --> 02:55:14.503
HOME OUR FAMILIES ARE DISTRESSED

02:55:14.570 --> 02:55:16.105
INDEED ARE ASSISTANCE SO WE

02:55:16.172 --> 02:55:18.174
DON'T GO AFTER THEM IN THE SENSE

02:55:18.241 --> 02:55:19.275
OF PART OF TRYING TO PROVIDE

02:55:19.342 --> 02:55:20.409
HARM. YOU NOT SAY THAT THE

02:55:20.476 --> 02:55:22.044
PRIMARY REASON FOR THIS

02:55:22.111 --> 02:55:22.979
PHILOSOPHICALLY.

02:55:23.045 --> 02:55:25.715
IS THAT THE LEAD PAINT ON THESE

02:55:25.781 --> 02:55:28.050
HOMES WAS APPLIED AT MINIMUM

02:55:28.117 --> 02:55:29.886
FORTY YEARS AGO. AND IN MOST

02:55:29.952 --> 02:55:31.587
CASES SEVENTY EIGHTY OR MORE

02:55:31.654 --> 02:55:33.289
YEARS AGO

02:55:33.356 --> 02:55:35.091
FAMILIES LIVING IN THOSE HOMES.

02:55:35.157 --> 02:55:36.459
THE OWNERS OF THOSE HOMES DID

02:55:36.525 --> 02:55:38.394
NOT PUT THAT HAZARD IN PLACE.

02:55:38.461 --> 02:55:40.263
SO IT MAKES NO SENSE TO BE

02:55:40.329 --> 02:55:41.631
TREATING THEM AS THE GUILTY

02:55:41.697 --> 02:55:42.164
PARTY FOR HAVING CREATED A

02:55:42.231 --> 02:55:43.499
HAZARD.

02:55:43.566 --> 02:55:45.835
AND THE COURTS CASE REAFFIRMS

02:55:45.902 --> 02:55:47.770
THAT IT IS IN FACT THE LEAD

02:55:47.837 --> 02:55:48.471
PAINT INDUSTRY THAT WAS

02:55:48.537 --> 02:55:50.239
RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATING THAT

02:55:50.306 --> 02:55:52.675
HAZARD IN THOSE HOMES.

02:55:52.742 --> 02:55:53.809
NOT AS FAR AS THE JUDGMENT IS

02:55:53.876 --> 02:55:54.777
CONCERNED I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

02:55:54.844 --> 02:55:56.145
TO REMEMBER THAT WE DO NOT

02:55:56.212 --> 02:55:57.546
DISPLACEMENT THAT JUDGMENT DOES

02:55:57.613 --> 02:55:58.648
NOT RESULT IN ANYONE BEING

02:55:58.714 --> 02:55:59.882
DISPLACED I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW

02:55:59.949 --> 02:56:01.417
THE CONCEPT OF HOMELESSNESS

02:56:01.484 --> 02:56:01.951
BEING INCREASE CAN EVEN BE

02:56:02.018 --> 02:56:03.319
BROUGHT UP IN THIS.

02:56:03.386 --> 02:56:05.421
THE IT'S NOBODY'S DISPLACED AND.

02:56:05.488 --> 02:56:07.556
WE DO NOT REDUCE AFFORDABLE

02:56:07.623 --> 02:56:08.858
HOUSING THE NOTION THAT WE WOULD

02:56:08.925 --> 02:56:11.227
BE REDUCING AFFORDABLE HOUSING

02:56:11.294 --> 02:56:12.728
IS EQUIVALENT TO ASSUMING THAT

02:56:12.795 --> 02:56:13.996
ONLY LEAD HAZARDS HOMES ARE

02:56:14.063 --> 02:56:15.364
AFFORDABLE WHICH IS CLEARLY NOT

02:56:15.431 --> 02:56:16.999
A TRUE STATEMENT. AND SO THAT

02:56:17.066 --> 02:56:18.401
JUXTAPOSITION DOES MAKE ANY

02:56:18.467 --> 02:56:20.236
LOGICAL SENSE TO ME THE POINT

02:56:20.303 --> 02:56:22.638
HERE IS THAT THE JUDGMENT ALLOWS

02:56:22.705 --> 02:56:24.173
US TO MAKE THE HOMES SAFER.

02:56:24.240 --> 02:56:25.808
DOESN'T MAKE THE MORE EXPENSIVE

02:56:25.875 --> 02:56:28.811
DOESN'T DISPLACE ANY.

02:56:28.878 --> 02:56:29.378
WITH REGARD TO THE PROPOSED

02:56:29.445 --> 02:56:30.913
INITIATIVE THAT WE'VE WE'VE YOU

02:56:30.980 --> 02:56:32.048
YOU ALL HAVE TALKED A FAIR BIT

02:56:32.114 --> 02:56:33.082
ABOUT IT AND THERE'S NOTHING I

02:56:33.149 --> 02:56:34.684
CAN OFFERS A NON LAWYER COME TO

02:56:34.750 --> 02:56:36.018
TO BETTER DESCRIBE THE PROBLEMS

02:56:36.085 --> 02:56:37.153
WITH THE INITIATIVE BUT I WILL

02:56:37.219 --> 02:56:39.622
OFFER. THAT OVERALL WITH THE

02:56:39.689 --> 02:56:40.823
PROPOSED INITIATIVE DOES IS IT

02:56:40.890 --> 02:56:42.224
DOES IS IT REMOVES KEY

02:56:42.291 --> 02:56:43.459
PROTECTIONS FOR HOMEOWNERS WHO

02:56:43.526 --> 02:56:44.393
ARE SEEKING REMEDIES FOR LEAD

02:56:44.460 --> 02:56:45.461
PAINT HAZARDS THAT THEY HAVE

02:56:45.528 --> 02:56:47.229
INHERITED IN THEIR HOMES. AND

02:56:47.296 --> 02:56:48.431
FOR SEEKING ASSISTANCE WITH THE

02:56:48.497 --> 02:56:50.599
REMEDIATION OF A HAZARD CREATED

02:56:50.666 --> 02:56:51.801
BY THE PAINT MANUFACTURERS

02:56:51.867 --> 02:56:52.601
IT RETROACTIVELY MOVES TO

02:56:52.668 --> 02:56:53.803
JUDGMENT AGAINST MANUFACTURERS

02:56:53.869 --> 02:56:54.537
HAVE HAD TO SALVAGE THEIR

02:56:54.603 --> 02:56:56.405
CULPABILITY. AND ELIMINATES THE

02:56:56.472 --> 02:56:57.974
JUDGMENT RELATED ABATEMENT FUND

02:56:58.040 --> 02:56:59.275
HAS ALREADY BEEN NOTED WHICH

02:56:59.342 --> 02:57:00.309
WOULD PROVIDE HUNDREDS OF

02:57:00.376 --> 02:57:01.744
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO THE

02:57:01.811 --> 02:57:02.945
IMPACT OF FAMILIES.

02:57:03.012 --> 02:57:03.813
IT TRANSFERS FISCAL

02:57:03.879 --> 02:57:04.981
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ADDRESSING

02:57:05.047 --> 02:57:05.881
THE HAS RECRUITED BY THE PAINT

02:57:05.948 --> 02:57:06.882
MANUFACTURERS TO THE GENERAL

02:57:06.949 --> 02:57:08.451
PUBLIC.

02:57:08.517 --> 02:57:09.719
AND IT DILUTES THE AVAILABLE

02:57:09.785 --> 02:57:10.886
MONEY FOR LEAD PAINT ABATEMENT

02:57:10.953 --> 02:57:12.188
BY MAKING THAT BOND FUND ADDRESS

02:57:12.254 --> 02:57:14.156
A FAR BROADER RANGE OF ISSUES.

02:57:14.223 --> 02:57:16.258
IT IT THERE WILL BE FAR LESS

02:57:16.325 --> 02:57:17.860
MONEY AVAILABLE FOR ABATEMENT IF

02:57:17.927 --> 02:57:19.462
THIS INITIATIVE PASSES BECAUSE

02:57:19.528 --> 02:57:21.364
OF A COMBINATION OF THINGS ONE.

02:57:21.430 --> 02:57:23.132
IS THAT WE'RE GONNA LOSE THE

02:57:23.199 --> 02:57:24.633
MONEY THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN

02:57:24.700 --> 02:57:26.569
PROVIDED IN THE ABATEMENT FROM

02:57:26.635 --> 02:57:27.870
THE JUDGMENT. WILL HAVE ONLY A

02:57:27.937 --> 02:57:29.405
PORTION OF ANY MONEY THAT IS

02:57:29.472 --> 02:57:30.740
COLLECTED THROUGH THE BOND FUND

02:57:30.806 --> 02:57:32.975
AND HOMEOWNERS WILL LOSE ACCESS

02:57:33.042 --> 02:57:33.542
TO MONEY THROUGH LEGITIMATE

02:57:33.609 --> 02:57:36.245
LAWSUITS THAT THE PROVEN

02:57:36.312 --> 02:57:36.879
CULPABILITY WOULD ALLOW THEM TO

02:57:36.946 --> 02:57:37.913
PURSUE.

02:57:37.980 --> 02:57:38.981
SO IN ESSENCE WHAT THE

02:57:39.048 --> 02:57:40.216
INITIATIVE IS DOING IS MAKING

02:57:40.282 --> 02:57:41.517
CALIFORNIA'S PAY FOR SURE WHEN

02:57:41.584 --> 02:57:43.185
LANSING CONAGRA'S LIABILITY AND

02:57:43.252 --> 02:57:44.320
IT REALLY DOES REPRESENT SIMPLY

02:57:44.387 --> 02:57:47.556
A PAIN INDUSTRY BAILOUT.

02:57:47.623 --> 02:57:49.258
THANK YOU LET'S GO TO OUR FINAL

02:57:49.325 --> 02:57:49.859

IS SERGEANT LOUDLY WITH THE

02:58:01.203 --> 02:58:01.670
CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF

02:58:01.737 --> 02:58:03.606
REALTORS.

02:58:03.672 --> 02:58:04.740
THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF

02:58:04.807 --> 02:58:05.941
REALTORS IN A COURT OF ITS

02:58:06.008 --> 02:58:07.376
GENERAL POLICY OF NOT TAKING

02:58:07.443 --> 02:58:09.245
POSITIONS ON INITIATIVES UNTIL

02:58:09.311 --> 02:58:11.013
THEY'RE FORMALLY QUALIFIED IS

02:58:11.080 --> 02:58:12.648
NOT TAKING AN OFFICIAL POSITION

02:58:12.715 --> 02:58:15.451
ON THIS INITIATIVE TODAY.

02:58:15.518 --> 02:58:17.053
SO I COME TO YOU NOT TO SPEAK

02:58:17.119 --> 02:58:18.287
FOR OR AGAINST THIS INITIATIVE.

02:58:18.354 --> 02:58:20.089
HOWEVER.

02:58:20.156 --> 02:58:20.956
THE PROPONENTS OF THIS

02:58:21.023 --> 02:58:22.358
INITIATIVE AND MAKE CLAIMS ABOUT

02:58:22.425 --> 02:58:23.526
THE EFFECT OF CON AGRA WHICH

02:58:23.592 --> 02:58:24.894
HAVE RAISED CONCERNS AMONG OUR

02:58:24.960 --> 02:58:26.262
MEMBERS. AS WELL AS THE

02:58:26.328 --> 02:58:27.797
HOMEOWNERS WHO WITH WHOM OUR

02:58:27.863 --> 02:58:29.965
MEMBERS WORK SO CLOSELY.

02:58:30.032 --> 02:58:30.900
THESE CLAIMS HAVE REQUIRED US TO

02:58:30.966 --> 02:58:32.468
LOOK AT THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF

02:58:32.535 --> 02:58:33.536
THE HOLDING IN THE CASE AND ITS

02:58:33.602 --> 02:58:34.770
POTENTIAL AFFECT ON IN THE

02:58:34.837 --> 02:58:37.306
INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS.

02:58:37.373 --> 02:58:38.641
SO I PURPOSE HERE TODAY IS TO

02:58:38.707 --> 02:58:39.942
OFFER OUR PERSPECTIVE ON THE

02:58:40.009 --> 02:58:41.177
EFFECT OF CONAGRA'S DECISION ON

02:58:41.243 --> 02:58:43.612
INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS.

02:58:43.679 --> 02:58:44.213
THE PROPONENTS OF THIS

02:58:44.280 --> 02:58:45.981
INITIATIVE IT OUTLINED A PARADE

02:58:46.048 --> 02:58:46.949
OF HORRIBLE'S FOR INDIVIDUAL

02:58:47.016 --> 02:58:48.217
HOMEOWNERS.

02:58:48.284 --> 02:58:50.519
AS A RESULT OF CONAGRA.

02:58:50.586 --> 02:58:52.121
WE DISAGREE OF THESE CONTENT

02:58:52.188 --> 02:58:52.922
CONTENTIONS ABOUT THE EFFECT ON

02:58:52.988 --> 02:58:54.457
HOMEOWNERS

02:58:54.523 --> 02:58:55.491
AND IN FACT BELIEVE THAT THERE

02:58:55.558 --> 02:58:57.193
SHOULD BE BASICALLY NO NEGATIVE

02:58:57.259 --> 02:58:58.961
EFFECT FOR INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS.

02:58:59.028 --> 02:59:01.030
SPECIFICALLY.

02:59:01.097 --> 02:59:02.531
THE DECISION DOES NOT TRIGGER

02:59:02.598 --> 02:59:03.899
NEW DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR

02:59:03.966 --> 02:59:04.767
HOME SELLERS REGARDING LEAD

02:59:04.834 --> 02:59:06.502
PAINT HAZARDS.

02:59:06.569 --> 02:59:07.770
SINCE NINETEEN NINETY TWO

02:59:07.837 --> 02:59:09.071
FEDERAL LAWS REQUIRED SELLERS

02:59:09.138 --> 02:59:10.206
AND THEIR AGENTS TO PROVIDE

02:59:10.272 --> 02:59:11.841
CERTAIN SPECIFIED DISCLOSURES

02:59:11.907 --> 02:59:13.742
REGARDING LEAD PAINT BASE PAINT

02:59:13.809 --> 02:59:15.544
AND LEAD BASED PAINT HAZARDS. IN

02:59:15.611 --> 02:59:16.812
SALEM LEASE TRANSACTIONS FOR

02:59:16.879 --> 02:59:18.147
HOPE HOUSING BUILT BEFORE

02:59:18.214 --> 02:59:20.149
NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT.

02:59:20.216 --> 02:59:21.717
PRE CONAGRA CALIFORNIA AND

02:59:21.784 --> 02:59:23.486
FEDERAL ALSO BOTH REQUIRE THE

02:59:23.552 --> 02:59:24.386
DISCLOSURE OF KNOWN LEAD PAINT

02:59:24.453 --> 02:59:26.755
HAZARDS.

02:59:26.822 --> 02:59:28.557
FURTHERMORE FOR THE MORE PRE CON

02:59:28.624 --> 02:59:30.526
AGRA CALIFORNIA LAW ALREADY HAS

02:59:30.593 --> 02:59:31.293
A PRESUMPTION THAT ANY HOME

02:59:31.360 --> 02:59:33.028
BUILT. PRIOR TO NINETEEN SEVENTY

02:59:33.095 --> 02:59:34.864
EIGHT HOUSE LEAD PAINT.

02:59:34.930 --> 02:59:36.232
NOTHING IN THIS DECISION CREATE

02:59:36.298 --> 02:59:37.933
ANY NEW DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS

02:59:38.000 --> 02:59:39.068
BEYOND THAT CONTAINED IN

02:59:39.135 --> 02:59:40.703
EXISTING LAW REGARDING THE

02:59:40.769 --> 02:59:42.138
HAZARDS OF LEAD PAINT THE

02:59:42.204 --> 02:59:43.405
HAZARDS OF LEAD PAINT HAVE NOT

02:59:43.472 --> 02:59:44.640
CHANGED SO THE DISCLOSURES

02:59:44.707 --> 02:59:47.576
REMAIN THE SAME.

02:59:47.643 --> 02:59:49.111
CONAGRA'S IT'S BEEN STATED

02:59:49.178 --> 02:59:50.746
EARLIER BY BY OTHERS DOES NOT

02:59:50.813 --> 02:59:51.814
MAKE EVERY HOME A PUBLIC

02:59:51.881 --> 02:59:53.516
NUISANCE NOR DOES IT MAKE THE

02:59:53.582 --> 02:59:54.683
HOMEOWNER LIVE A FULL FOR A

02:59:54.750 --> 02:59:56.085
PUBLIC NUISANCE HAS BEEN AS HAS

02:59:56.152 --> 02:59:57.753
BEEN. CIRCULATED BY SOME OF THE

02:59:57.820 --> 02:59:59.321
PROPONENTS.

02:59:59.388 --> 03:00:00.456
THE COURT'S RULING FOUNDED THE

03:00:00.523 --> 03:00:01.557
DEFENDANT PAINT COMPANIES LIABLE

03:00:01.624 --> 03:00:03.759
FOR PUBLIC NUISANCE.

03:00:03.826 --> 03:00:04.827
DUE TO THEIR CONDUCT IN

03:00:04.894 --> 03:00:06.195
PROMOTING LEAD PAINT FRONTIER

03:00:06.262 --> 03:00:07.930
YOUR RESIDENTIAL USE WHILE

03:00:07.997 --> 03:00:08.531
KNOWING OF THE HOUSE IT WOULD

03:00:08.597 --> 03:00:09.865
CREATE.

03:00:09.932 --> 03:00:11.667
IT DID NOT FIND THE PRESENCE OF

03:00:11.734 --> 03:00:12.902
LEAD PAINT IN AN INDIVIDUAL HOME

03:00:12.968 --> 03:00:14.470
IS A PUBLIC NUISANCE.

03:00:14.537 --> 03:00:15.704
BUT RATHER THAT THE OVERALL

03:00:15.771 --> 03:00:16.872
DANGER CREATED BY THE POLICE

03:00:16.939 --> 03:00:17.973
FRICTION OF LEAD PAINT.

03:00:18.040 --> 03:00:20.976
WAS A PUBLIC NUISANCE.

03:00:21.043 --> 03:00:22.344
SUCH A FINDING DOES NOT IN ANY

03:00:22.411 --> 03:00:24.346
WAY MAKE THE HOMEOWNER LIABLE

03:00:24.413 --> 03:00:25.748
FOR PUBLIC NUISANCE AS IS BEING

03:00:25.814 --> 03:00:26.549
CONSTANTLY SUGGESTED BY THE

03:00:26.615 --> 03:00:28.317
PROPONENTS.

03:00:28.384 --> 03:00:29.818
FURTHERMORE ANY SUCH FINDING OF

03:00:29.885 --> 03:00:30.686
LIABILITY FOR INDIVIDUAL

03:00:30.753 --> 03:00:32.021
HOMEOWNERS IT ALSO BE SOMEWHAT

03:00:32.087 --> 03:00:33.756
ABSURD SINCE THE HOMEOWNERS

03:00:33.822 --> 03:00:35.191
EFFECTIVELY THE VICTIM AND WOULD

03:00:35.257 --> 03:00:36.559
BE PUTTING THE LIABILITY ON THE

03:00:36.625 --> 03:00:37.927
VICTIM OF THE ACTIONS OF THE

03:00:37.993 --> 03:00:40.863
DEFENDANT PAINT COMPANY.

03:00:40.930 --> 03:00:42.164
IT'S AN ALSO STATED THAT THE

03:00:42.231 --> 03:00:43.699
VALUE OF HOMES THAT CONTAIN LEAD

03:00:43.766 --> 03:00:44.800
PAINT WITH THIS DECREASE IN

03:00:44.867 --> 03:00:46.101
VALUE AS A RESULT OF THE HOLDING

03:00:46.168 --> 03:00:47.870
AND CON AGRA.

03:00:47.937 --> 03:00:49.672
THIS IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY.

03:00:49.738 --> 03:00:51.473
FIRST TO REITERATE THE NATURE OF

03:00:51.540 --> 03:00:53.008
LEAD PAINT HAS NOT CHANGED NOR

03:00:53.075 --> 03:00:54.977
HAS THE NATURE OF ITS HAZARDS.

03:00:55.044 --> 03:00:55.544
FURTHERMORE THE LAW ALREADY

03:00:55.611 --> 03:00:57.146
PRESUMES THAT LEAD PAINT IS

03:00:57.213 --> 03:00:58.647
PRESENT ON PRE IN PRE NINETEEN

03:00:58.714 --> 03:01:00.683
SEVENTY EIGHT PROPERTIES.

03:01:00.749 --> 03:01:02.084
ANY PRICE EFFECTS OF THE

03:01:02.151 --> 03:01:04.086
PRESENCE OF LEAD PAINT MADE HAVE

03:01:04.153 --> 03:01:05.187
ON A PRE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT

03:01:05.254 --> 03:01:06.355
PROPERTY HAVE PRESUMABLY ALREADY

03:01:06.422 --> 03:01:10.359
BEEN PRICED IN.

03:01:10.426 --> 03:01:11.627
IF ANYTHING THE STRONGER

03:01:11.694 --> 03:01:13.195
ARGUMENT IS THAT THE ABILITY TO

03:01:13.262 --> 03:01:14.697
TAKE PART IN FREE REMEDIATION

03:01:14.763 --> 03:01:16.165
PROGRAMS COULD INCREASE THE

03:01:16.232 --> 03:01:17.833
VALUE OF HOMES WHICH PARTICIPATE

03:01:17.900 --> 03:01:18.701
OR ARE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN

03:01:18.767 --> 03:01:21.237
SUCH PROGRAMS.

03:01:21.303 --> 03:01:22.705
WE ALSO DO NOT SEE HOW CONAGRA

03:01:22.771 --> 03:01:24.440
CREATES AN UNFUNDED MANDATE OR

03:01:24.506 --> 03:01:25.975
INDEED ANY KIND OF MANDATE FOR

WOULDN'T INCLUDE THAT ALL THE

03:07:32.441 --> 03:07:33.508
PRE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT HOMES

03:07:33.575 --> 03:07:35.544
A GREAT OKAY. AND I JUST FIND IT

03:07:35.611 --> 03:07:36.645
THERE WONDERFULLY COINCIDENTAL

03:07:36.712 --> 03:07:37.746
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO

03:07:37.813 --> 03:07:40.315
BILLION DOLLARS OF LIABILITY FOR

03:07:40.382 --> 03:07:41.550
THE STATE JUST FOR THIS PURSES.

03:07:41.617 --> 03:07:42.684
THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS THAT THE

03:07:42.751 --> 03:07:43.952
PAIN COMPANIES WERE SUGGESTING

03:07:44.019 --> 03:07:45.921
THE TAXPAYERS PAY FOR.

03:07:45.988 --> 03:07:46.989
AND.

03:07:47.055 --> 03:07:48.557
.

03:07:48.624 --> 03:07:49.925
ONE FINAL QUESTION FOR THE

03:07:49.992 --> 03:07:52.260
LAWYERS ON AT THIS MOMENT EVERY

03:07:52.327 --> 03:07:53.562
YEAR WE HAVE TENS OF THOUSANDS

03:07:53.629 --> 03:07:55.030
OF CALIFORNIA CHILDREN WHO ARE

03:07:55.097 --> 03:07:57.366
SUFFERING FROM LEAD POISONING.

03:07:57.432 --> 03:07:58.900
MY UNDERSTANDING IS EVEN WITH

03:07:58.967 --> 03:08:00.469
THIS COURT JUDGMENT THERE'S NOT

03:08:00.535 --> 03:08:03.038
MONEY THAT'S GOING TO GO TO PAY

03:08:03.105 --> 03:08:04.272
FOR THE HEALTH COSTS OF THOSE

03:08:04.339 --> 03:08:05.641
INDIVIDUALS RIGHT IT'S SIMPLY

03:08:05.707 --> 03:08:07.442
GOING. FOR LEAD PAINT INSPECTION

03:08:07.509 --> 03:08:09.177
THEN CLEAN UP AND REMEDIATION

03:08:09.244 --> 03:08:10.379
FOR THE PHYSICAL STRUCTURE OF

03:08:10.445 --> 03:08:13.115
HOMES BUT NOTHING TO THE

03:08:13.181 --> 03:08:14.683
CHILDREN THAT THE TWO DOCTORS ON

03:08:14.750 --> 03:08:16.084
TODAY'S PANEL WE'RE DISCUSSING.

03:08:16.151 --> 03:08:17.953
THAT'S GREAT THERE'S NO MEDICAL

03:08:18.020 --> 03:08:19.021
PAYMENTS BEING MADE IS ANYONE

03:08:19.087 --> 03:08:21.857
ESTIMATE THE COST TO SOCIETY OF

03:08:21.923 --> 03:08:24.359
THOSE MEDICAL PAYMENTS.

03:08:24.426 --> 03:08:25.727
WHAT I THINK EASY FIGURES

03:08:25.794 --> 03:08:27.129
THERE'S SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE

03:08:27.195 --> 03:08:28.530
THAT A DOLLAR SPENT ON ABATEMENT

03:08:28.597 --> 03:08:30.432
IS WORTH BETWEEN SEVENTEEN

03:08:30.499 --> 03:08:33.201
DOLLARS OF OF DAMAGE AND TWO

03:08:33.268 --> 03:08:34.803
HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS? SO

03:08:34.870 --> 03:08:36.672
IF YOU TOOK THE TWO BILLION COST

03:08:36.738 --> 03:08:38.006
OF ABATEMENT MULTIPLIED BY

03:08:38.073 --> 03:08:40.075
SEVENTEEN I THINK THAT WOULD BE

03:08:40.142 --> 03:08:42.077
THE VERY LOW END FIGURE. OF THE

03:08:42.144 --> 03:08:43.311
HEALTH COSTS THAT ARE BEING

03:08:43.378 --> 03:08:46.014
AVOIDED. BY ABATING INSTEAD OF

03:08:46.081 --> 03:08:48.116
TREATING SO THIRTY FOUR BILLION

03:08:48.183 --> 03:08:50.052
DOLLARS WORTH TO STICK UP FOR

03:08:50.118 --> 03:08:50.686
HIM THAT'S VERY MUCH ON THE LOW

03:08:50.752 --> 03:08:50.886
END.

03:08:50.952 --> 03:08:52.220
OKAY.

03:08:52.287 --> 03:08:53.922
I'M IN A FINAL QUESTION TO.

03:08:53.989 --> 03:09:02.330
THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM HOMEOWNERS GIVEN THE

03:09:02.397 --> 03:09:03.665
DISCLOSURES THAT HAVE HAPPENED

03:09:03.732 --> 03:09:05.200
GIVEN THE FACT THAT. BEFORE THIS

03:09:05.267 --> 03:09:07.302
RULING THE LEAD WAS ALREADY IN

03:09:07.369 --> 03:09:08.503
THE PAINT ON PEOPLE'S WALLS AND

03:09:08.570 --> 03:09:09.905
AFTER THIS RULING THAT IS STILL

03:09:09.971 --> 03:09:10.472
THE SAME NOTHING REALLY HAS

03:09:10.539 --> 03:09:12.240
CHANGED FROM THE.

03:09:12.307 --> 03:09:13.308
CORRECT BICU WE DON'T BELIEVE

03:09:13.375 --> 03:09:14.609
THAT ANY NEGATIVE OF

03:09:14.676 --> 03:09:15.877
RAMIFICATIONS FROM CON AIRCRAFT

03:09:15.944 --> 03:09:17.312
FOR INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS.

03:09:17.379 --> 03:09:19.514
AND HAVE YOU SEEN A PARTICULARLY

03:09:19.581 --> 03:09:21.249

ANY IMPACT HOME PRICES BECAUSE

03:09:23.452 --> 03:09:25.053

03:09:26.088 --> 03:09:27.556
IMPACT OF REGARDING THIS AND

03:09:27.622 --> 03:09:28.890
AGAIN THE NATURE OF THE LEAD

03:09:28.957 --> 03:09:30.692
PAINT HAUSER HAS NOT CHANGED

03:09:30.759 --> 03:09:32.227
THAT LET'S PAINT HAZARD REMAINS

03:09:32.294 --> 03:09:34.196
THE SAME. AND SO PRESUMABLY THAT

03:09:34.262 --> 03:09:35.330
HAZARD IS.

03:09:35.397 --> 03:09:36.898
PRICED INTO THE HOMES WHICH

03:09:36.965 --> 03:09:38.166
THAT WOULD BE AFFECTED BY THAT

03:09:38.233 --> 03:09:39.301
SO REALLY THE IMPACT OF THE

03:09:39.367 --> 03:09:41.703
LAWSUIT WAS SIMPLY TO FIND.

03:09:41.770 --> 03:09:43.338

DEAL WITH THIS CONTAMINATION.

03:15:22.010 --> 03:15:24.145
THE MARKETING AND SELLING OF

FOR ALL THOSE REASONS WE STAND

03:15:45.500 --> 03:15:45.967
EXTREMELY OPPOSED TO THIS

03:15:46.034 --> 03:15:48.970
INITIATIVE THING.

OF THE HEALTHY HOMES

03:15:58.646 --> 03:15:59.881
COLLABORATIVE WHERE WE WERE

03:15:59.948 --> 03:16:01.950
ACTUALLY TRULY TRYING TO PROTECT

03:16:02.016 --> 03:16:03.618
CHILDREN FROM LEAD POISONING. AN

03:16:03.685 --> 03:16:04.719
ARM ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

03:16:04.786 --> 03:16:06.321
SAID IS THAT WE NEED PUBLIC

03:16:06.387 --> 03:16:08.123
POLICIES THAT STOPS USING

03:16:08.189 --> 03:16:09.858
CHILDREN AS LEAD DETECTORS.

03:16:09.924 --> 03:16:11.559
AND ONE OF THOSE POLICIES WAS

03:16:11.626 --> 03:16:14.929
ACTUALLY.

03:16:14.996 --> 03:16:16.931
HAVE LET'S SAY PRACTICES AND WE

03:16:16.998 --> 03:16:18.366
WERE WE KNEW ABOUT THIS

03:16:18.433 --> 03:16:20.135
SETTLEMENT AND WE KNEW THAT THIS

03:16:20.201 --> 03:16:21.069
COULD BE ONE OF THE MOST

03:16:21.136 --> 03:16:22.504
IMPORTANT MEASURES. TO PREVENT

03:16:22.570 --> 03:16:24.572
LEAD PAINT AND TO HEAR THE

03:16:24.639 --> 03:16:26.808
CYNICISM OF THE INDUSTRY INVOKE

03:16:26.875 --> 03:16:29.177
CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS AND INVOKE

03:16:29.244 --> 03:16:30.912
THE IDEA THAT YOU'RE TO FIGURE

03:16:30.979 --> 03:16:32.547
DEFENDING AGAINST DISPLACEMENT.

03:16:32.614 --> 03:16:34.849
IS A PATENT FALSEHOOD AMONG ALSO

03:16:34.916 --> 03:16:36.284
HERE BECAUSE MY NIECE HAD OF

03:16:36.351 --> 03:16:37.752
ELEVATED LEAD LEVEL WHEN SHE WAS

03:16:37.819 --> 03:16:39.587
THREE. AND WE WERE ABLE TO

03:16:39.654 --> 03:16:41.022
ENROLL HER HOUSE IN HUNTINGTON

03:16:41.089 --> 03:16:43.057
PARK IN A LEAD ABATEMENT PROGRAM

03:16:43.124 --> 03:16:44.859
THAT ACTUALLY INCREASE THE VALUE

03:16:44.926 --> 03:16:46.561
OF A HOME AT THAT TIME SHE WAS

03:16:46.628 --> 03:16:48.596
HAD A RENTAL UNIT. AND PART OF

03:16:48.663 --> 03:16:50.031
THAT AGREEMENT WAS THAT THE SHE

03:16:50.098 --> 03:16:52.534
COULD NOT IT EVICTED TENANT AND

03:16:52.600 --> 03:16:53.835
THERE WAS NONE OF THESE ISSUES

03:16:53.902 --> 03:16:55.036
SO THERE'S A WAY TO DO THESE

03:16:55.103 --> 03:16:56.704
PROGRAMS THAT WORK. THAT PROTECT

03:16:56.771 --> 03:16:58.273
CHILDREN FROM LEAD POISONING AND

03:16:58.339 --> 03:17:00.508
CLEAN UP OUR HOUSING STOCK AND.

03:17:00.575 --> 03:17:01.876
WE HOPE THAT THIS INITIATIVE

03:17:01.943 --> 03:17:02.777
DOESN'T GO THROUGH THAT SOMEHOW

03:17:02.844 --> 03:17:04.646
THESE GUYS FIND SOME PRINCIPLES

03:17:04.712 --> 03:17:05.613
AND NOT DO THIS.

03:17:05.680 --> 03:17:06.981
BECAUSE THE CLINIC THEY MADE THE

03:17:07.048 --> 03:17:08.650
MESS AND THEY SHOULD CLEAN IT UP.

03:17:08.716 --> 03:17:10.018

COME UP WITH THOUGHTFUL

03:17:12.587 --> 03:17:14.556
LEGISLATION THAT WILL STOP USING

CHILDREN MISLED DETECTORS AND

03:17:16.524 --> 03:17:17.091
