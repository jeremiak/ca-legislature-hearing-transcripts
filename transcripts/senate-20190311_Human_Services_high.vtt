ELIGIBLE FOR A CAL FRESH AYE.

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:40.459
AYE IT SEEM LIKE YOU'RE PLAY IS

00:07:40.526 --> 00:07:41.961
I I JUST CLARIFY OR MAYBE IT'S

00:07:42.028 --> 00:07:43.729
BOTH BUT I JUST TRY --

00:07:43.796 --> 00:07:45.164
SO CERTAINLY SUPPORT THE BILL

00:07:45.231 --> 00:07:46.232
AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT HAT

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:46.532
FOR BY -- I

00:07:46.599 --> 00:07:48.868
ALSO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHERE OUR

00:07:48.935 --> 00:07:50.036
RATE LIMITING STATUS WHAT WHICH

00:07:50.102 --> 00:07:51.470
WHICH PART IS THE ISSUES THAT

00:07:51.537 --> 00:07:52.805
THAT MAINLY THE AWARENESS ARTS

00:07:52.872 --> 00:07:55.308
ALSO THE ELIGIBILITY SIDE FOR

00:07:55.374 --> 00:07:58.411
THE COUNTY TRYING TO FIGUREOUT

00:07:58.477 --> 00:07:59.579
THIS PERSON QUALIFY.

00:07:59.645 --> 00:08:00.413
A GREAT QUESTION I I WOULD SAY

00:08:00.479 --> 00:08:01.180
IT'S BOTH FOR THE STUDENT AND

00:08:01.247 --> 00:08:01.814
THE ELIGIBILITY WORKER AND SO.

00:08:01.881 --> 00:08:03.182
THE CALPERS PROGAM IS BASED ON

00:08:03.249 --> 00:08:05.151
USDA REGULATIONS OF THE STATE

00:08:05.218 --> 00:08:06.652
HAS TO INTERPRET THAT REGULATION

00:08:06.719 --> 00:08:07.720
AND THEN IN TURN PASS THAT

00:08:07.787 --> 00:08:09.255
INTERPRETATION DOWN TO FIFTY

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:10.423
EIGHT COUNTY SO.

00:08:10.489 --> 00:08:11.424
THERE'S OFTENTIMES MA'AM BEAUTY

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:12.592
THERE THEN YOU FACTOR IN

00:08:12.658 --> 00:08:14.594
HUNDREDS OF OF COLLEGES THAT ALL

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:15.595
HAVE A DIFFERENT FINANCIAL AID

00:08:15.661 --> 00:08:16.996
OFFICE WITH A DIFFERENT FORM A

00:08:17.063 --> 00:08:17.830
DIFFERENT DOCUMENT.

00:08:17.897 --> 00:08:18.998
AND THEN YOU HAVE HUNDREDS OF

00:08:19.065 --> 00:08:20.266
THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS.

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:21.534
WHO HAVE TO GET THAT FORMER

00:08:21.601 --> 00:08:23.135
DOCUMENT WHICHEVER ONE THAT IS

00:08:23.202 --> 00:08:24.637
THE FINANCIAL AID OFFICE USES

BRING THAT TO THEIR CAL FRESH

00:08:25.938 --> 00:08:27.006
WORKER FROM THE FIFTY EIGHT

00:08:27.073 --> 00:08:27.740
COUNTIES?

00:08:27.807 --> 00:08:28.875
THERE'S JUST AND AN UNBELIEVABLE

00:08:28.941 --> 00:08:30.710
AMOUNT OF AMBIGUITY THERE AND SO

00:08:30.776 --> 00:08:32.245
IDEALLY WHAT THIS WILL HELP IS

00:08:32.311 --> 00:08:33.179
THE STUDENT WILL SAY HEY STUDENT

00:08:33.246 --> 00:08:34.280

SOME OF THE MORE COMMON

00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:51.490
EXEMPTIONS WOULD BE --

00:09:51.557 --> 00:09:52.692
YOU'RE WORKING OVER TWENTY HOURS

00:09:52.758 --> 00:09:54.026

SMALL OFFBEAT.

00:10:02.535 --> 00:10:03.936
MORE LIKELY THAN NOT YOU'RE

THIS --

00:10:12.678 --> 00:10:14.680
WHETHER IT'S CONSISTENT OR NOT

00:10:14.747 --> 00:10:16.282
WITH THE INTENT OF THIS

00:10:16.349 --> 00:10:19.452
LEGISLATION TO ALSO --

00:10:19.518 --> 00:10:21.220
MAKE THIS INFORMATION AVAILABLE

TO ALL STUDENTS --

00:10:22.989 --> 00:10:24.957
THAT THERE ARE FOOD BANKS AT

00:10:25.024 --> 00:10:26.425
THESE DIFFERENT SCHOOL THAT AT A

00:10:26.492 --> 00:10:27.893
NUMBER OF SCHOOLS.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.463
THAT MAY NOT.

00:10:30.529 --> 00:10:31.731
REQUIRE THE THE THE CAL FOR A

00:10:31.797 --> 00:10:32.999
SHOULD YOU KNOW THE FAIRLY

00:10:33.065 --> 00:10:34.567
EXTENSIVE.

00:10:34.633 --> 00:10:37.370
THE CRITERIA THAT EXISTS TO TO

00:10:37.436 --> 00:10:39.338
QUALIFY UNDER CAL FRESH --

00:10:39.405 --> 00:10:40.973
IS THERE ANY REASON THAT YOU

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.010
CAN'T HAVE SORT OF ONE OUT REACH

00:10:44.076 --> 00:10:46.012
ONE PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS STUDENTS

00:10:46.078 --> 00:10:47.113
WHETHER THEY ARE.

00:10:47.179 --> 00:10:48.381
GOOD THEY QUALIFY FOR CAL

00:10:48.447 --> 00:10:50.316
FRAZIER MY QUALIFY FOR FOOD

00:10:50.383 --> 00:10:52.785
BANKS. TO TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS

00:10:52.852 --> 00:10:54.053
THAT FOOD IS THAT WHAT WE'RE

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.621
TALKING ABOUT WE WANT STUDENTS

00:10:55.688 --> 00:10:56.655
TO BE ABLE TO EAT.

00:10:56.722 --> 00:10:59.025
AND TO BE ABLE TO EAT HOPEFULLY

00:10:59.091 --> 00:11:01.360
IN A HEALTHY WAY WELL THEIR

00:11:01.427 --> 00:11:02.728
STUDENTS LEARNING.

00:11:02.795 --> 00:11:04.363
YOU KNOW THE THE TASKS THAT ARE

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:05.331
GOING TO MAKE THEIR MARK

00:11:05.398 --> 00:11:08.200
ECONOMIC BASE IN THE FUTURE --

00:11:08.267 --> 00:11:11.704
COULD YOU RESPOND TO THAT --

00:11:11.771 --> 00:11:12.972
I THINK ACTUALLY IN THE BILL

00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:14.340
ANALYSIS TO THERE IS A SECTION

00:11:14.407 --> 00:11:16.675
IT CITES FOODS FOOD BANKS ON

00:11:16.742 --> 00:11:17.443
CAMPUS AS WELL WHICH IS A SAD

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.378
FACT AS YOU POINTED OUT WE HAVE

00:11:19.445 --> 00:11:20.279
TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION --

00:11:20.346 --> 00:11:21.480
CAL FRESH ALSO HAS SOME

00:11:21.547 --> 00:11:22.848
LIMITATIONS IN TERMS OF WHO CAN

00:11:22.915 --> 00:11:25.117
APPLY SO I I DO CERTAINLY AGREE

00:11:25.184 --> 00:11:26.352
HUNGER ON CAMPUS IS A HUGE

00:11:26.419 --> 00:11:27.686
PROBLEM IT'S IT'S IT'S AN

00:11:27.753 --> 00:11:30.423
EPIDEMIC ACROSS THE U. S. --

00:11:30.489 --> 00:11:31.023
THERE WAS SOME WORK DONE LAST

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:35.194
YEAR SOME REALLY ASSEMBLY BILL --

00:11:35.261 --> 00:11:35.761
TWENTY FOUR TO FOURTEEN THAT

00:11:35.828 --> 00:11:36.896
ACTUALLY DID A VERY SIMILAR

00:11:36.962 --> 00:11:39.131
THING WITH CAL GRANT AND HAD

00:11:39.198 --> 00:11:41.767
DIFFERENT CAMPUSES NOTIFY --

00:11:41.834 --> 00:11:42.868
STUDENTS IF THEY'RE ON CAL GRANT

00:11:42.935 --> 00:11:44.236
AS AN EXEMPTION AND SO AS PART

00:11:44.303 --> 00:11:45.871
OF THIS AS WELL AND IT'S PART OF

00:11:45.938 --> 00:11:47.039
THE THE BILL TO CENTER DOT IS

00:11:47.106 --> 00:11:48.207
PROPOSING.

00:11:48.274 --> 00:11:49.341
OUR TALKING BUT BRING THIS TO A

00:11:49.408 --> 00:11:50.543
WORKER FOR COMMUNITY TALK ABOUT

00:11:50.609 --> 00:11:51.944
THESE ISSUES AND I THINK IT'S

00:11:52.011 --> 00:11:53.579
GONNA TAKE MORE THAN ONE THING

00:11:53.646 --> 00:11:55.114
TO SOLVE THE WHOLE PROBLEM --

00:11:55.181 --> 00:11:56.816
SNAP IS THE FEDERAL TERM FOR FOR

00:11:56.882 --> 00:11:58.517
CAL FRESH IT'S A SUPPLEMENT

00:11:58.584 --> 00:12:00.586
NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM SO

00:12:00.653 --> 00:12:02.288
CAL FRESH IS BY NO MEANS MEANT

00:12:02.354 --> 00:12:04.123
TO USE FOR FILL ALL OF YOUR FOOD

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:04.690
NEED THAT THE SUPPLEMENTAL.

00:12:04.757 --> 00:12:06.358
PIECE SO I THINK THE MORE THAT

00:12:06.425 --> 00:12:08.094
WE CAN DO TO KIND OF WE'VE ALL

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.161
THOSE WEBS AND PULL ALL THOSE

00:12:09.228 --> 00:12:10.629
PIECES TOGETHER --

00:12:10.696 --> 00:12:11.730
THE THE MORE WE CAN COMBAT THIS

00:12:11.797 --> 00:12:13.099
ISSUE ON CAMPUSES AND THAT SORT

00:12:13.165 --> 00:12:14.533
OF MY BOTTOM LINE IS THERE SOME

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.768
WAY WE CAN.

00:12:15.835 --> 00:12:17.369
DO THAT WE CAN INCORPORATE THEM

00:12:17.436 --> 00:12:19.271
SO THAT STUDENTS DON'T HAVE TO

00:12:19.338 --> 00:12:21.040
TRY TO FIGURE OUT THERE WHICH

00:12:21.107 --> 00:12:22.842
ONE OF SIXTEEN PROGRAMS THEY MAY

00:12:22.908 --> 00:12:24.310
QUALIFY FOR IN THAT.

00:12:24.376 --> 00:12:26.479
THEY CAN JUST GO TO ONE PLACE

00:12:26.545 --> 00:12:27.913
FIND OUT WHERE THEY CAN GET THAT

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:32.952
FOOD THEY NEED AND BE ABLE --

00:12:33.018 --> 00:12:34.987
TO ACCESS.

00:12:35.054 --> 00:12:35.588
EXCEPT FOR WHETHER STUDENTS IS

00:12:35.654 --> 00:12:36.122
THAT.

00:12:36.188 --> 00:12:37.656
BECAUSE OF ALL THE DIFFERENT.

00:12:37.723 --> 00:12:40.693
LEVELS OF BUREAUCRACY.

00:12:40.759 --> 00:12:42.394
UNREALISTIC CHORUSES SOMETHING

00:12:42.461 --> 00:12:43.796
YOU'RE WORKING TOWARDS.

00:12:43.863 --> 00:12:44.997
I THINK IT'S A GREAT SUGGESTION

00:12:45.064 --> 00:12:47.266
I THINK OF THAT CAME FROM FROM

00:12:47.333 --> 00:12:47.833
SOMEBODY THAT.

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:48.901
IT'S COUNTIES AND SCHOOL

00:12:48.968 --> 00:12:50.503
DISTRICTS AND COUNTY ERA YOU

00:12:50.569 --> 00:12:51.871
SEASONS YES YOU COULD WORK ON

00:12:51.937 --> 00:12:53.339
SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES.

00:12:53.405 --> 00:12:55.040
THE LEGISLATION WE'VE SEEN

00:12:55.107 --> 00:12:55.774
PROBABLY OF THE LAST FIVE OR SIX

00:12:55.841 --> 00:12:57.076
YEARS HAS CERTAINLY MOVED IN

00:12:57.143 --> 00:12:58.444
THAT DIRECTION AND I THINK THAT

00:12:58.511 --> 00:13:00.279
AS LEGISLATORS LIKE YOURSELF

00:13:00.346 --> 00:13:01.647
KEEP BRINGING THIS ISSUE UP IN

00:13:01.714 --> 00:13:02.248
AND MISSED CENTER DOT BRINGS

00:13:02.314 --> 00:13:03.716
THIS ISSUE OF I THINK WE'RE

00:13:03.782 --> 00:13:04.617
MOVING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THAT

00:13:04.683 --> 00:13:05.050
FACT.

00:13:05.117 --> 00:13:06.285
AND IDEALLY I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT

00:13:06.352 --> 00:13:07.620
WE SHOULD HAVE A CENTRAL HUB OF

00:13:07.686 --> 00:13:08.687
INFORMATION THE JUST TARGETS HOW

00:13:08.754 --> 00:13:11.357
DO WE COMBAT HUNGER ON CAMPUS.

00:13:11.423 --> 00:13:14.193
AND BRING ALL THOSE TOOLS IN --

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.829
I DON'T THE HEADING THAT

00:13:16.896 --> 00:13:18.931
DIRECTION IF IT'S POSSIBLE WOULD

00:13:18.998 --> 00:13:20.633
SEEM TO MAKE SENSE I I'M

00:13:20.699 --> 00:13:22.067
ASSUMING HE WOULD HAVE.

00:13:22.134 --> 00:13:23.469
DONE THAT IF IT WERE.

00:13:23.536 --> 00:13:24.970
POSSIBLE AND IT MIGHT NOT BE BUT

OUR STANDARD DEBIT CARD --

00:15:58.157 --> 00:15:59.558
IN AGAIN IN THE BILL ANALYSIS

00:15:59.625 --> 00:16:01.026
THERE IS A SECTION THE TALK

00:16:01.093 --> 00:16:02.261
ABOUT UNITY ON CAMPUS WHICH IS

00:16:02.328 --> 00:16:03.629
AN AMAZING THING I THINK THE

00:16:03.696 --> 00:16:06.432

STORE ON CAMPUS OR THE CAFETERIA

00:16:10.135 --> 00:16:10.969
THE OTHER SPOTS.

00:16:11.036 --> 00:16:13.505
ARE THE EASIER THE ACCESS IS FOR

00:16:13.572 --> 00:16:14.039
FOR STUDENTS TO USE THOSE

00:16:14.106 --> 00:16:15.607
BENEFITS THEY'RE AGAIN THIS IS

00:16:15.674 --> 00:16:16.608
ONE OF THOSE AREAS WERE OFTEN

00:16:16.675 --> 00:16:21.046
TIMES THE THE FEDERAL REGULATION --

00:16:21.113 --> 00:16:22.014
DOESN'T ALWAYS MAKE TONS OF

00:16:22.081 --> 00:16:23.982
SENSE YEAH LOCALLY IT IN SO MANY

00:16:24.049 --> 00:16:25.617
THINGS BUT BUT THERE ARE OPTIONS

00:16:25.684 --> 00:16:26.618
THERE'S AND THERE'S SIDE RATS

00:16:26.685 --> 00:16:27.653
AND I'M IS THERE CHANGING.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:28.987
I THINK ANYTHING WE COULD DO TO

00:16:29.054 --> 00:16:30.356
ENCOURAGE THE SPREAD OF AB T.

00:16:30.422 --> 00:16:32.224
ACCEPTANCE WHEREVER IS A GREAT

00:16:32.291 --> 00:16:33.325
THING BECAUSE THAT'S FOOD ACCESS

00:16:33.392 --> 00:16:34.827
AT THE ABILITY OF OF PEOPLE TO

00:16:34.893 --> 00:16:36.095
USE THEIR BENEFITS AND YOU KNOW

00:16:36.161 --> 00:16:37.262
IF YOU'RE IN THE HEART OF DAVIS

00:16:37.329 --> 00:16:38.897
UC DAVIS CAMPUS IT'S PRETTY HARD

00:16:38.964 --> 00:16:39.331
TO GET.

00:16:39.398 --> 00:16:40.866
ALL THE WAY TO THE NEAREST STORE

00:16:40.933 --> 00:16:42.034
RESTAURANT ETCETERA ETCETERA AND

00:16:42.101 --> 00:16:43.035
SO IF YOU'RE RUNNING BETWEEN

00:16:43.102 --> 00:16:44.603
CLASSES YOU NEED LUNCH --

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:45.671
I DO THINK TO SOME EXTENT

00:16:45.738 --> 00:16:46.672
CAMPUSES EMBRACING THAT'S A

00:16:46.739 --> 00:16:48.073
REALLY GOOD THING AND THAT'S

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:49.641
STARTING TO HAPPEN BUT I I KNOW

00:16:49.708 --> 00:16:50.275
WE CAN ALL --

00:16:50.342 --> 00:16:51.810
ENCOURAGE CAMPUSES OUR

00:16:51.877 --> 00:16:53.412
RESPECTIVE DISTRICTS TO KIND OF

00:16:53.479 --> 00:16:56.148
FOLLOW SUIT AND EXPLORE AB T. ON

00:16:56.215 --> 00:16:57.249
CAMPUS.

00:16:57.316 --> 00:16:58.050
SO -- I'M

00:16:58.117 --> 00:16:58.717
SURE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:16:58.784 --> 00:17:01.620
IS A MICRO MANAGE EVERY BE THE

00:17:01.687 --> 00:17:01.887
BENEFIT.

00:17:01.954 --> 00:17:02.821
OF COURSE THEY CAN DO SOME

00:17:02.888 --> 00:17:04.857
ANALYSIS AND I FIND IT SHOCKING

00:17:04.923 --> 00:17:06.859
AS WELL AS YOU DO THAT --

00:17:06.925 --> 00:17:08.293
MEAL PLANS WOULD BE EXCLUDED

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:09.795
WHEN AS IT'S SO CONVENIENT IS

00:17:09.862 --> 00:17:11.263
ACTING VERY COST EFFECTIVE FOR

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:15.000
THEM TO UTILIZE THAT --

00:17:15.067 --> 00:17:15.701
DO YOU USE.

00:17:15.768 --> 00:17:16.402
DO YOU SEE THE FEDERAL

00:17:16.468 --> 00:17:17.836
GOVERNMENT REALLY --

00:17:17.903 --> 00:17:18.637
ENFORCING THAT --

00:17:18.704 --> 00:17:21.940
OR SHOULD BE --

00:17:22.007 --> 00:17:23.509
THINK WE SHOULD URGE SOME OF OUR

00:17:23.575 --> 00:17:24.910
FEDERAL LEGISLATORS THIS I MEAN

00:17:24.977 --> 00:17:27.112
HUNGER IN SCHOOLS OF IS A

00:17:27.179 --> 00:17:28.113

00:17:39.391 --> 00:17:41.226
I WANT TO BELABOR THIS BUDGET I

00:17:41.293 --> 00:17:42.561

TO HEAR ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I

00:17:44.997 --> 00:17:45.364
THINK IT'S WRONG.

00:17:45.431 --> 00:17:47.933
AND IT SHOULD BE FIXED AT THE AT

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.401

00:19:50.022 --> 00:19:51.657
END.

00:19:51.723 --> 00:19:52.457
IN THIS ECONOMY COULD BE

00:19:52.524 --> 00:19:54.326
EXPANDED.

00:19:54.393 --> 00:19:56.995
SO WHAT IT SB TWO THIRTY FOUR

00:19:57.062 --> 00:20:00.265

00:20:00.332 --> 00:20:01.900
AMEND OUR STATUTE SO THAT WE

00:20:01.967 --> 00:20:03.335

00:20:10.208 --> 00:20:11.810
THE SAME.

00:20:11.877 --> 00:20:14.146
AND CLEAR FIGHT THAT CHILD CARE

00:20:14.212 --> 00:20:16.381
OF THIS SORT WOULD BE ALLOWED IN

00:20:16.448 --> 00:20:18.517

00:20:18.584 --> 00:20:20.085

SO -- GOOD

00:20:51.516 --> 00:20:52.384
AFTERNOON --

00:20:52.451 --> 00:20:53.819
AS A FAMILY CHILDCARE PROVIDER I

00:20:53.885 --> 00:20:58.657
SHARE A HEARING AND EDUCATING

00:20:58.724 --> 00:20:59.992
CHILDREN SO THAT THEY HAVE A

00:21:00.058 --> 00:21:01.593
GREAT START IN LIFE.

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:03.228
I'M HERE TODAY TO TELL YOU ABOUT

00:21:03.295 --> 00:21:05.330
SB TWO THREE FOUR AND WHY IT'S

00:21:05.397 --> 00:21:06.398
SO IMPORTANT.

00:21:06.465 --> 00:21:08.333
WHAT SHOULD BE A SIMPLE RIGHT AS

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.035
A FAMILY CHILDCARE PROVIDER TO

00:21:10.102 --> 00:21:11.770
OPERATE A FAMILY CHILDCARE IN A

00:21:11.837 --> 00:21:12.938
HOME THAT I RAN?

00:21:13.005 --> 00:21:15.207
WITHOUT HASSLE OR DISCRIMINATION

00:21:15.273 --> 00:21:17.342
OFTEN COMES WITH THE PROCESS OF

00:21:17.409 --> 00:21:19.444
BEING THREATENING AND EXTREMELY

00:21:19.511 --> 00:21:20.846
FRUSTRATING --

00:21:20.912 --> 00:21:22.581
I LOST MY HOME DURING THE

00:21:22.648 --> 00:21:25.050
ECONOMIC CRISIS AND AS A RESULT

00:21:25.117 --> 00:21:27.119
OF THAT I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO

00:21:27.185 --> 00:21:27.552
GRANT.

00:21:27.619 --> 00:21:29.221
US SINCE THEN I'VE HAD TO DEAL

00:21:29.287 --> 00:21:31.690
WITH LANDLORDS WHO REQUIRE THREE

00:21:31.757 --> 00:21:34.092
TIMES THE DEPOSIT --

00:21:34.159 --> 00:21:35.694
JUST BECAUSE I CARE FOR CHILDREN

00:21:35.761 --> 00:21:37.963
IN MY HOME DESPITE WE HAVE IN

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:41.099
HOME CARE LIABILITY INSURANCE

00:21:41.166 --> 00:21:41.700
THAT WOULD PROTECT THEM FROM

00:21:41.767 --> 00:21:42.668
LIABILITY.

00:21:42.734 --> 00:21:44.670
I FOUND THAT RENTAL APPLICATIONS

00:21:44.736 --> 00:21:47.072
WERE EITHER DENIED OR REVOKED

00:21:47.139 --> 00:21:48.540
THE MINUTE I TOLD THEM.

00:21:48.607 --> 00:21:50.175
IN THE MINUTE I TOLD POTENTIAL

00:21:50.242 --> 00:21:52.244
LANDLORD THE I HAD A HOME BASED

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:53.712
FAMILY CHILDCARE.

00:21:53.779 --> 00:21:55.480
I SAW FOR SALE FIND TO BE PLACED

00:21:55.547 --> 00:21:57.883
ON A HOME THAT I WAS RANTING TO

00:21:57.949 --> 00:21:59.217
FIND OUT LATER THAT THE OWNER

00:21:59.284 --> 00:22:00.919
NEVER HAD ANY INTENTION ON

00:22:00.986 --> 00:22:02.387
SELLING HE JUST WANTED TO MAKE

00:22:02.454 --> 00:22:04.089
SURE THAT I WOULD VACATE THE

00:22:04.156 --> 00:22:05.424
PROPERTY.

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:06.692
IN THE EASIEST POSSIBLE WAY.

00:22:06.758 --> 00:22:08.660
SO I HAD TO MOVE THREE TIMES

00:22:08.727 --> 00:22:10.829
SINCE I LOST MY HOME AND WITH

00:22:10.896 --> 00:22:12.597
EACH MOVE THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL

00:22:12.664 --> 00:22:14.266
SET OF CHALLENGES THAT COME WITH

00:22:14.332 --> 00:22:14.900
IT.

00:22:14.966 --> 00:22:18.003
TRYING TO FIND A HOME THAT'S

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:20.305
STILL IN MY NAME IT WILL

00:22:20.372 --> 00:22:22.007
CONTINUE TO TO ACCESS THE

00:22:22.074 --> 00:22:23.041
SERVICES.

00:22:23.108 --> 00:22:25.310
THAT I PROVIDE FIRE INSPECTIONS

00:22:25.377 --> 00:22:26.678
THAT NEED TO BE COMPLETED

00:22:26.745 --> 00:22:27.813
LICENSING --

00:22:27.879 --> 00:22:30.215
HAVING TO COME TO MY HOME AND

00:22:30.282 --> 00:22:31.717
AND DEMI'S SAFE.

00:22:31.783 --> 00:22:33.518
THERE'S A GAP IN CARE WHICH

00:22:33.585 --> 00:22:35.921
MEANS A LOSS IN WAGES FOR ME AND

00:22:35.987 --> 00:22:38.123
A LOSS AND CARE FOR THE FAMILIES

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:40.325
BECAUSE I CAN'T READ OPEN MY NEW

00:22:40.392 --> 00:22:41.426

00:22:41.493 --> 00:22:42.227

00:22:42.294 --> 00:22:43.895
LIES AND COMES IN AND SAYS IT'S

00:22:43.962 --> 00:22:46.131
OKAY AND IT MEANS INSTABILITY

00:22:46.198 --> 00:22:47.699
FOR OUR CHILDREN BECAUSE THEIR

00:22:47.766 --> 00:22:49.067
PARENTS HAVE TO GO OUT AND FIND

00:22:49.134 --> 00:22:51.670
TEMPORARY CARE UNTIL I CAN GET

00:22:51.737 --> 00:22:53.572

00:22:53.638 --> 00:22:55.340

00:39:38.609 --> 00:39:40.077
SO IF SOMEONE WANTS TO OPEN A

00:39:40.144 --> 00:39:42.613
FACILITY IN AN APARTMENT COMPLEX

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:44.515
THEY WILL NOW BE ABLE TO DO SO

00:39:44.582 --> 00:39:45.850
WHERE IS BEFORE THEY WERE NOT.

00:39:45.916 --> 00:39:46.917
WELL IT DEPENDS ON THE

00:39:46.984 --> 00:39:47.785
JURISDICTION THERE MANY

JURISDICTIONS FOR WHICH WAS

00:39:49.186 --> 00:39:50.421
ALLOWED WAS ONE OF THOSE THE

00:39:50.488 --> 00:39:52.423
STATE LAW IS NOT CLEAR SO THERE

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:54.358
WAS NO BLANKET.

00:39:54.425 --> 00:39:57.394
OF ELIMINATION NO BLANKET

00:39:57.461 --> 00:40:00.264

00:40:11.041 --> 00:40:13.978
QUESTION AND CRITICALLY

00:40:14.044 --> 00:40:15.446
IMPORTANT WE'VE GOT TO HAVE MORE.

APARTMENT COMPLEXES I I'M I'M

00:40:26.724 --> 00:40:28.359
JUST THINKING OF THE OTHER

00:40:28.425 --> 00:40:30.094
PEOPLE IN AN APARTMENT COMPLEX

00:40:30.161 --> 00:40:31.495
WE WANT THESE KIDS HAVE A GREAT

00:40:31.562 --> 00:40:32.963
TIME WE WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO

CHILDREN --

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:37.902
BUT I DO KNOW A NUMBER OF PEOPLE

00:40:37.968 --> 00:40:39.370
WHO WORK SORT OF NONTRADITIONAL

00:40:39.436 --> 00:40:40.571
HOURS.

00:40:40.638 --> 00:40:42.306
AND SO IF THEY'RE TRYING TO

00:40:42.373 --> 00:40:44.341
SLEEP IT DURING THE DAY WHEN

00:40:44.408 --> 00:40:46.010

00:40:46.076 --> 00:40:48.179
OF FACILITY THERE DO THEY IF YOU

KNOW HOW DO WE ADDRESS THERE

00:40:49.613 --> 00:40:51.248
RIGHT TO THE QUITE ENJOYMENT OF

00:40:51.315 --> 00:40:53.751
THEIR OF THEIR APARTMENT FORCES

CHILDREN.

00:40:57.955 --> 00:41:00.691
SO THIS BILL DOES NOT MODIFY

00:41:00.758 --> 00:41:04.895
WHATSOEVER ANY STANDARDS AROUND.

00:41:04.962 --> 00:41:07.298
THE THERE'S A CORE OF

00:41:09.099 --> 00:41:10.835
REQUIREMENTS PER CHILD THERE'S

00:41:10.901 --> 00:41:12.770
VARIOUS REQUIREMENTS SO THIS

00:41:12.837 --> 00:41:14.438
BILL DOES NOT ALTER THAT.

00:41:14.505 --> 00:41:19.076
THOSE ARE STILL IN THE CODE SO

00:41:19.143 --> 00:41:20.811
YOU KNOW LET'S SAY YOU HAD.

00:41:20.878 --> 00:41:21.846
I'M JUST BEING HYPOTHETICAL HERE

00:41:21.912 --> 00:41:23.447
A THREE HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT

00:41:23.514 --> 00:41:24.448
APARTMENT OR SOMETHING.

00:41:24.515 --> 00:41:25.382
NOT.

00:41:25.449 --> 00:41:27.818
YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE A

00:41:27.885 --> 00:41:28.786
FOURTEEN EVEN IFWE PASS THIS

00:41:28.853 --> 00:41:31.188
LAW SO SO THOSE THINGS IT DOES

00:41:31.255 --> 00:41:33.123
NOT OVERRIDE THE LICENSE

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:35.059
REQUIREMENTS ARE STILL --

00:41:35.125 --> 00:41:35.392
STILL EXIST.

00:41:35.459 --> 00:41:40.898
THE OTHER THING IS THAT THE

00:41:40.965 --> 00:41:43.000
ABILITY YOUR HOURS OF YOUR

00:41:43.067 --> 00:41:45.436
FACILITY ARE ALSO --

00:41:45.502 --> 00:41:47.404
YOU HAVE TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE

00:41:47.471 --> 00:41:49.373
IN IN GETTING YOUR PERMIT AND WE

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:52.243
DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING AROUND

00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:54.144
REQUIRING SAY THAT LOCAL

00:41:54.211 --> 00:41:55.246
GOVERNMENTS NO DON'T GET TO HAVE

00:41:55.312 --> 00:41:56.447
A SAY OVER.

00:41:56.513 --> 00:42:00.117
THE HOURS OF YOUR PERMITTED --

00:42:00.184 --> 00:42:01.852
WHEN YOU HAVE THE --

00:42:01.919 --> 00:42:05.456
FACILITY OPEN RIGHT SO CERTAINLY

00:42:05.522 --> 00:42:09.660
IN THOSE CASES WHERE --

00:42:09.727 --> 00:42:13.330
THE THE APARTMENT COMPLEXES SUCH

00:42:13.397 --> 00:42:15.032
WHERE YOU WHERE YOU WOULD NOT BE

00:42:15.099 --> 00:42:19.603
ABLE -- TO

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:21.538
PROTECT ANY OF YOUR RESIDENT OF

00:42:21.605 --> 00:42:22.873
THE RESIDENTS FROM.

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:24.541
POTENTIAL DISRUPTION YOU KNOW

00:42:24.608 --> 00:42:26.443
THAT WOULD BE FACTORED I IMAGINE

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:28.879
BY THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT --

00:42:28.946 --> 00:42:30.314
ADDITIONALLY --

00:42:30.381 --> 00:42:32.917
WELL I A STATED THAT THIS BILL

00:42:32.983 --> 00:42:35.519
WOULD ALLOW FOR THE FOURTEEN

00:42:35.586 --> 00:42:37.121
THAT THE CHILD CARE FACILITIES

00:42:37.187 --> 00:42:39.023
WITH FOURTEEN CHILDREN TO BE

00:42:39.089 --> 00:42:40.824
TREATED THE SAME AS EIGHT ARE

00:42:40.891 --> 00:42:42.526
ONE OF OUR SPEAKERS DID MAKE A

00:42:42.593 --> 00:42:44.194
CORRECTION WHICH IS ACCURATE.

00:42:44.261 --> 00:42:45.729
WHICH I DID NOT --

00:42:45.796 --> 00:42:47.464
GIVE THOUGH IT THAT DETAIL WHICH

00:42:47.531 --> 00:42:49.500
IS REALLY IT'S ALLOWING FOR FOR

00:42:49.566 --> 00:42:51.068
MORE CHILDREN.

00:42:51.135 --> 00:42:53.237
IT IS SO GOES TO TWELVE THE TWO

00:42:53.304 --> 00:42:55.272
ADDITIONAL UNDER THE EXISTING

00:42:55.339 --> 00:42:57.041
LAW WHICH WE DON'T CHANGE WOULD

00:42:57.107 --> 00:43:00.110
HAVE TO BE AFTER SCHOOL SO THEY

00:43:00.177 --> 00:43:01.211
WOULD NOT BE A FULL DAY.

00:43:01.278 --> 00:43:02.613
SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE AND

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:04.782
THEN IF THERE'S ANY OTHER LEGAL

00:43:04.848 --> 00:43:06.216
POINT THAT YOU WANT TO MAKE YES

00:43:06.283 --> 00:43:07.418
I ALSO WANTED TO ADD THAT THE

00:43:07.484 --> 00:43:09.486
DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES

00:43:09.553 --> 00:43:11.722
AND THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL HAVE

00:43:11.789 --> 00:43:14.024
BOTH ISSUED GUIDANCE --

00:43:14.091 --> 00:43:15.626
IT'S NOT IT'S BEEN IN STANDING

00:43:15.693 --> 00:43:17.194
FOR MANY YEARS THAT FAMILY CHILD

00:43:17.261 --> 00:43:18.762
CARE IS ALLOWED IN APARTMENTS

00:43:18.829 --> 00:43:20.364
AND CONDOS WE'RE CLEANING UP THE

00:43:20.431 --> 00:43:22.666
LANGUAGE IN THE BILL TO CLARIFY

00:43:22.733 --> 00:43:24.268
AND I AND LAKE --

00:43:24.335 --> 00:43:27.471
SENATOR SKINNER SAID --

00:43:27.538 --> 00:43:28.105
THE FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS

00:43:28.172 --> 00:43:30.908
WHAT'S THE REQUIREMENTS WITHIN

00:43:30.975 --> 00:43:32.376
APARTMENTS AND CONDOS IN THE

00:43:32.443 --> 00:43:34.044
BOTTOM LINE IS ALSO THAT THERE'S

00:43:34.111 --> 00:43:35.045
MANY FAMILIES WHO LIVE IN

00:43:35.112 --> 00:43:36.447
APARTMENTS WHO ALSO NEED

00:43:36.513 --> 00:43:38.048
CHILDCARE CLOSE TO HOME.

00:43:38.115 --> 00:43:40.451
AND SO WE HAVE SIT CITIES THAT

00:43:40.517 --> 00:43:41.919
WE KNOW OF WHERE THEY BANNED

00:43:41.986 --> 00:43:42.386
FAMILY CHILD CARE FROM

00:43:42.453 --> 00:43:44.421
APARTMENTS FAMILIES WHO ARE

00:43:44.488 --> 00:43:46.123
LIVING IN APARTMENTS ARMENIANS

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:47.992
DRIVE TO THE NEXT TOWN. TO GET

00:43:48.058 --> 00:43:50.728
CHILD CARE.

00:43:50.794 --> 00:43:52.262
IT UP I UNDERSTAND THE SAID.

00:43:52.329 --> 00:43:54.198
IT'S A BIT OF A WEIGHING PROCESS

00:43:54.264 --> 00:43:55.899
BECAUSE OF LET'S SAY I MANAGE

00:43:55.966 --> 00:43:57.668
YOUR OWN AN EIGHT UNIT APARTMENT

00:43:57.735 --> 00:43:59.169
BUILDING ND I KNOW THAT TWO OF

00:43:59.236 --> 00:44:02.339
THE PEOPLE IN MY UNITS ARE LET'S

00:44:02.406 --> 00:44:03.640
SEE NURSES.

00:44:03.707 --> 00:44:06.610
AND THEY WORK FROM ELEVEN PM TO

00:44:06.677 --> 00:44:09.146
SEVEN AM OR EIGHT AM --

00:44:09.213 --> 00:44:10.147
AND THEY WANT TO COME HOME AND

00:44:10.214 --> 00:44:11.915
SLEEP ED IN THE SYSTEM THAT I'M

00:44:11.982 --> 00:44:14.885
CALM THE SITUATION --

00:44:14.952 --> 00:44:16.653
ARE YOU INDICATING THAT THAT

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:18.555
WE'VE ALREADY MADE A POLICY

00:44:18.622 --> 00:44:20.190
DECISION THAT SAYS.

00:44:20.257 --> 00:44:22.693
THAT IF THERE'S A FAMILY DAYCARE

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:24.695
CENTER IT CAN STILL OPERATE

00:44:24.762 --> 00:44:26.263
WITHIN THAT APARTMENT UNIT IN

00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:27.798
THE PEOPLE WHO WORKED IN ON

00:44:27.865 --> 00:44:29.299
TRADITIONAL HOURS ARE JUST GOING

00:44:29.366 --> 00:44:32.069
TO HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT OR MOVE.

00:44:32.136 --> 00:44:33.103
AT A GET OFF.

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:34.505
I'VE NEVER HAD THE GOOD THE

00:44:34.571 --> 00:44:35.839
MISFORTUNE I SHOULD SAY OF

00:44:35.906 --> 00:44:37.508
HAVING TO WORK THOSE HOURS BUT I

00:44:37.574 --> 00:44:38.776
KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO DO AND

00:44:38.842 --> 00:44:40.444
I JUST WONDER WHAT THE

00:44:40.511 --> 00:44:42.513
RESPONSIBILITIES ARE OF THE

00:44:42.579 --> 00:44:44.048
PROPERTY MANAGER OR THE THE

00:44:44.114 --> 00:44:46.016
PROPERTY OWNER --

00:44:46.083 --> 00:44:47.918

AWARE OF THAT OR WE JUST SIMPLY.

00:44:51.655 --> 00:44:53.323
CONFIRMING EXISTING OR EXPANDING

00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:55.359
EXISTING LAW ONLY TO THE EXTENT

00:44:55.426 --> 00:44:56.927

CHILDREN IT'S REALLY DAY.

00:44:58.829 --> 00:45:01.498
THE AS WAS POINTED OUT IT'S

00:45:01.565 --> 00:45:04.535
REALLY MAKING A AND THE STATE

00:45:04.601 --> 00:45:05.969
DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES

00:45:06.036 --> 00:45:07.104
HAS ALREADY MADE THE CLARITY

00:45:07.171 --> 00:45:08.639
THAT.

00:45:08.705 --> 00:45:10.874
THERE YOU YOU TECHNICALLY ARE

00:45:10.941 --> 00:45:12.242

HAVING IT REALLY IN STATUTE IT

00:45:21.952 --> 00:45:25.155
CAN BE --

00:45:25.222 --> 00:45:26.356
SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN

00:45:26.423 --> 00:45:26.990
CHOOSE TO ENTER PRODUCES CERTAIN

00:45:27.057 --> 00:45:28.525
WAY.

00:45:28.592 --> 00:45:29.793
WHAT ABOUT THE PROPERTY OWNERS

00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:32.629

00:46:00.524 --> 00:46:01.959
WELL I WILL SAY THAT THE SAME

00:46:02.025 --> 00:46:04.294
REQUIREMENTS THAT APPLY TO EVERY

00:46:04.361 --> 00:46:06.130
OTHER RESIDENT APPLIED TO FAMILY

PROPERTY MANAGERS CANNOT

00:46:10.868 --> 00:46:12.970
PROHIBIT.

00:46:13.036 --> 00:46:16.039

ALL THE ONES THAT WE WORK WITH

00:46:21.111 --> 00:46:22.546
REALLY WORK WITH THEIR NEIGHBORS

00:46:22.613 --> 00:46:23.947
TO ACCOMMODATE THEIR NEEDS IF

00:46:24.014 --> 00:46:25.282

ACTIVITIES MORE QUIET ACTIVITIES

00:46:30.787 --> 00:46:31.321
DURING THE TIMES THAT PEOPLE

00:46:31.388 --> 00:46:32.289
SLEEP.

00:46:32.356 --> 00:46:33.023
OR YOU KNOW --

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:36.793
OUTSIDE SO FAMILY CHILD CARE

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:38.228
PROVIDERS AND TINY CAN SPEAK

00:46:38.295 --> 00:46:39.630
MORE TO THIS --

00:46:39.696 --> 00:46:42.299
THEY REALLY DO YOU WORK A LOT

00:46:42.366 --> 00:46:43.667
WITH THEIR NEIGHBORS TIM.

00:46:43.734 --> 00:46:45.135
CREATE A PEACEFUL LEAVING LIVING

00:46:45.202 --> 00:46:47.538
ENVIRONMENT.

00:46:47.604 --> 00:46:48.605
YEAH AND THEN WE SHARE SOMETHING

00:46:48.672 --> 00:46:50.874
TOO BECAUSE I KNOW AUTOMATICALLY

00:46:50.941 --> 00:46:52.342
PEOPLE WHEN WHEN WE SAY.

00:46:52.409 --> 00:46:53.977
CHILD CARE ENVIRONMENT YOU

00:46:54.044 --> 00:46:55.579
AUTOMATICALLY THINK OF CRYING

00:46:55.646 --> 00:46:58.549
BABIES.

00:46:58.615 --> 00:47:00.717
I WAS THINKING OF LAUGHING KIDS

00:47:00.784 --> 00:47:04.888
OVER. NINE SO BUT THE SAME WAY

00:47:04.955 --> 00:47:06.423
THAT THERE IS A CERTAIN.

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:07.424
LICENSING MANDATES THAT THERE'S

00:47:07.491 --> 00:47:08.759
A CERTAIN NUMBER OF SCHOOL AGE

00:47:08.825 --> 00:47:09.660
CHILDREN.

00:47:09.726 --> 00:47:12.162
PRESCHOOL AGE CHILDREN THEY

00:47:12.229 --> 00:47:13.997
MANDATE HOW MANY EVENTS WITH TO

00:47:14.064 --> 00:47:16.133
HAVE ALSO AND I THINK EVERYBODY

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:19.069
WHO BECAUSE I'VE BEEN DOING THIS

00:47:19.136 --> 00:47:20.037
TWENTY FOUR YEARS.

00:47:20.103 --> 00:47:21.138
I WHEN I DECIDED TO DO THIS I

00:47:21.205 --> 00:47:23.941
WAS VERY CONSCIENTIOUS ABOUT.

00:47:24.007 --> 00:47:26.577
WHAT I WAS ABOUT TO DO AND I

00:47:26.643 --> 00:47:28.545
WHEN I STARTED BEFORE I BOUGHT

00:47:28.612 --> 00:47:31.348
MY HOME I DID LIVE IN A TOWN

00:47:31.415 --> 00:47:32.282
HOUSE?

00:47:32.349 --> 00:47:33.550
AND I HAVE.

00:47:33.617 --> 00:47:34.952
OF MY NEIGHBORS.

00:47:35.018 --> 00:47:35.986
THEY HAD CHILDREN.

00:47:36.053 --> 00:47:37.955
TO AND SO I REALIZED THE

00:47:38.021 --> 00:47:39.356
ENVIRONMENT THAT I WAS GETTING

00:47:39.423 --> 00:47:41.725
READY TO START THIS BUSINESS AND

00:47:41.792 --> 00:47:43.794
THEN I ALSO REALIZE THAT THERE

00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:45.696
WOULD BE A CERTAIN LEVEL OF

00:47:45.762 --> 00:47:46.029
NOISE.

00:47:46.096 --> 00:47:47.598
THAT WHEN I MOVED INTO THAT

00:47:47.664 --> 00:47:50.167
TOWNHOUSE THERE WERE --

00:47:50.234 --> 00:47:52.402
IN MY LEASE.

00:47:52.469 --> 00:47:53.704
THERE WERE RULES THERE AND SO I

00:47:53.770 --> 00:47:55.272
COMPLETELY UNDERSTOOD THAT AND

00:47:55.339 --> 00:47:56.940
SO.

00:47:57.007 --> 00:48:00.143
WE HAVE THE SAME RULES AS ANY

00:48:00.210 --> 00:48:00.744
OTHER TENANT [inaudible]

00:48:00.811 --> 00:48:04.781
BUT I STRONGLY BELIEVE.

00:48:04.848 --> 00:48:06.450
AND I STAND BY THE FACT THAT

00:48:06.516 --> 00:48:07.651
BEFORE WE START DOING THIS
