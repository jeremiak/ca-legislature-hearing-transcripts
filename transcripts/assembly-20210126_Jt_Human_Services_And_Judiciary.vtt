TIME ON THIS YEAR. WHEN WE TALK

00:29:28.933 --> 00:29:31.002
ABOUT FAMILY SEPARATION IT'S

00:29:31.069 --> 00:29:31.636
IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO BRING UP THE

00:29:31.703 --> 00:29:35.006
RACIST AND HATEFUL MESSAGES.

00:29:35.073 --> 00:29:36.875

WE'VE HEARD ALL THE HORRIBLE

00:29:47.118 --> 00:29:48.153
THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED

00:29:48.219 --> 00:29:50.989
BECAUSE OF THIS POLICY BUT IT

00:29:51.055 --> 00:29:52.891
BEARS REPEATING AGAIN. NOT JUST

00:29:52.957 --> 00:29:54.159
BECAUSE IT'S A RACIST POLICY

00:29:54.225 --> 00:29:56.227
BUT JUST. NOT JUST BECAUSE OF

00:29:56.294 --> 00:29:58.329
THE BAD POLICY BUT BECAUSE IT'S

00:29:58.396 --> 00:30:03.067
A MORAL FAILURE. FOR A COUNTRY.

00:30:03.134 --> 00:30:04.636
WE ESTIMATE THAT AS A RESULT OF

00:30:04.702 --> 00:30:06.137
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S

00:30:06.204 --> 00:30:09.040
POLICY. OVER TWENTY SIX HUNDRED

00:30:09.107 --> 00:30:10.508

00:30:10.575 --> 00:30:13.678

IMPACTED BY THIS POLICY WERE

00:30:26.691 --> 00:30:30.028
UNDER THE AGE OF FIVE. THESE

00:30:30.094 --> 00:30:31.829
CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE

00:30:31.896 --> 00:30:34.732
OUR NEIGHBORS OUR FRIENDS

00:30:36.901 --> 00:30:38.937

HARM DONE. BUT CALIFORNIA NEEDS

00:30:50.048 --> 00:30:51.482

MISTER GLENDALE I HAVE A

01:05:46.575 --> 01:05:49.412
QUESTION A FOLLOW UP ON-

01:05:49.478 --> 01:05:50.379
REGARDING THE NUMBER OF

01:05:50.446 --> 01:05:52.615
CHILDREN SEPARATED I UNDERSTAND

01:05:52.682 --> 01:05:54.917
FROM A NEW YORK- THE NEW YORK

01:05:54.984 --> 01:05:56.986
TIMES IS ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND

01:05:57.053 --> 01:06:00.022
FORTY FIVE- CHILDREN. AND THIS

01:06:00.089 --> 01:06:01.357
WAS BASED ON I GUESS KNOCKED

01:06:01.424 --> 01:06:03.693
OVER TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY I

01:06:03.759 --> 01:06:05.928
GUESS MY REAL QUESTION IS THERE

01:06:05.995 --> 01:06:09.131
THAT NUMBER REPRESENTS- THE

01:06:09.198 --> 01:06:10.333
CHILDREN WHO ARE STILL

01:06:10.399 --> 01:06:12.168
OUTSTANDING WHO HAVE NOT BEEN

01:06:12.234 --> 01:06:14.103
REUNITED WITH THEIR- PARENTS-

01:06:14.170 --> 01:06:16.339
AND THEN WHAT METHOD ARE YOU

01:06:16.405 --> 01:06:18.607
USING. TO TRY TO REACH THE

01:06:18.674 --> 01:06:20.776
COMMUNITIES THAT MAY KNOW

01:06:20.843 --> 01:06:23.245
SOMETHING TO TRY TO REACH THOSE

01:06:23.312 --> 01:06:25.348
AND REUNITE THOSE CHILDREN WITH

01:06:25.414 --> 01:06:26.649
THOSE PARENTS IS THEIR

01:06:26.716 --> 01:06:29.085
COMMUNICATION IS GOING OUT OF

01:06:29.151 --> 01:06:30.319
SPANISH WHAT ARE THE BOOTS ON

01:06:30.386 --> 01:06:33.189
THE GROUND TO TRY TO REALLY-

01:06:33.255 --> 01:06:34.590
YOU KNOW I'M FRIDAY MAKE SURE

01:06:34.657 --> 01:06:36.325
THAT THOSE. THOSE MOTHERS AND

01:06:36.392 --> 01:06:38.894
FATHERS NO IF YOUR CHILDREN ARE

01:06:38.961 --> 01:06:39.595
THERE SO WHAT KIND OF

01:06:39.662 --> 01:06:41.697
COMMUNICATIONS ARE IN FACT

01:06:41.764 --> 01:06:44.133
BEING USED TO TRY TO REACH OF

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:45.034
THE PARENTS BECAUSE THE KIDS

01:06:45.101 --> 01:06:46.168
THE KIDS CAME WITH THE PARENTS

01:06:46.235 --> 01:06:50.139
THAT HAVE. TO BE THE PARENTS

01:06:50.206 --> 01:06:52.575
REACHING THE KIDS. YES SO I

01:06:52.641 --> 01:06:54.643
WILL I'LL TAKE THAT QUESTION-

01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:58.347
IN. IN EACH PART- SO IN OCTOBER

01:06:58.414 --> 01:07:00.282
THE FIVE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE

01:07:00.349 --> 01:07:02.752
NUMBER REFERS TO. THE OLDEST

01:07:02.818 --> 01:07:06.989
SEPARATIONS- ONLY AND THAT WAS

01:07:07.056 --> 01:07:08.691
THE NUMBER OF PARENTS THAT WE

01:07:08.758 --> 01:07:10.693
HAVE NOT REACHED AT THAT POINT-

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:12.328
THE REASON WE USE SIX HUNDRED

01:07:12.395 --> 01:07:14.797
NOW IS BECAUSE THERE IS A SMALL

01:07:14.864 --> 01:07:18.901
GROUP. OF PARENTS WHO WERE

01:07:18.968 --> 01:07:21.337
DISCLOSED TO US LATE BUT ARE

01:07:21.404 --> 01:07:22.405
NOT AMONG THE OLDEST

01:07:22.471 --> 01:07:24.673
SEPARATIONS AND THAT IS A GROUP

01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:26.976
WHERE WE- ESSENTIALLY THERE IS

01:07:27.042 --> 01:07:28.444
NO REASON TO MAKE A DISTINCTION

01:07:28.511 --> 01:07:31.747
BETWEEN. WHEN A FAMILY WAS

01:07:31.814 --> 01:07:34.016
DISCLOSED PURPOSE OF WHETHER OR

01:07:34.083 --> 01:07:36.819
NOT WE NEED TO FIND THEM SO-

01:07:36.886 --> 01:07:37.553
YOU KNOW AND AS WE TRY TO

01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:40.689
IMPROVE THE WAY REPORT OUT

01:07:40.756 --> 01:07:41.190
NUMBERS WE HAVE TRIED TO

01:07:41.257 --> 01:07:44.293
BASICALLY. TREATED AS THE MOST

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:45.327
ACCURATE NUMBER THAT WE CAN

01:07:45.394 --> 01:07:47.163
GIVE TAT INCLUDES ALL CHILDREN

01:07:47.229 --> 01:07:49.098
ACROSS ANY POINT AT WHICH THEY

01:07:49.165 --> 01:07:51.333
WERE DISCLOSED TO US. HAVE WE

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:53.335
FOUND THEIR PARENTS ARE NOT SO.

01:07:53.402 --> 01:07:56.238
THE FIVE FORTY FIVE IS INCLUDED

01:07:56.305 --> 01:07:57.373
WITHIN THE SIX HUNDRED NUMBER I

01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:59.508
CITED TO YOU. AND MOST

01:07:59.575 --> 01:08:02.178
IMPORTANT THERE IS. WE JUST

01:08:02.244 --> 01:08:05.014
DON'T KNOW UNTIL WE REACH THAT

01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:07.483
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE STATUS

01:08:07.550 --> 01:08:09.819
THAT FAMILY IS AND WE HAVE TO-

01:08:09.885 --> 01:08:11.420
TRY TO GUARD AGAINST THE WORST

01:08:11.487 --> 01:08:12.888
POSSIBLE OUTCOME WHICH WOULD BE

01:08:12.955 --> 01:08:14.924
THAT THEY ARE STILL SEPARATED-

01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:17.426
WORRIED AND POSSIBLY EVEN NOT

01:08:17.493 --> 01:08:18.761
IN CONTACT WHICH WOULD BE THE

01:08:18.828 --> 01:08:20.362
SORT OF NIGHTMARE SCENARIO. SO

01:08:20.429 --> 01:08:21.230
THAT'S WHAT MOTIVATES THE

01:08:21.297 --> 01:08:23.532
SEARCHES. I ON THE SECOND PART

01:08:23.599 --> 01:08:24.800
OF THE QUESTION I'LL TRY TO BE

01:08:24.867 --> 01:08:28.003
BRIEF- YES THERE ARE EFFORTS ON

01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:31.073
THE GROUND IN COMMUNITIES- IN

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:32.942
CENTRAL AMERICA. PRIMARILY IN

01:08:33.008 --> 01:08:35.377
GUATEMALA WE'RE THE LARGEST SET

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:39.482
OF. SEPARATED FAMILIES IS FROM-

01:08:39.548 --> 01:08:40.583
SO WE PARTNER WITH A GROUP

01:08:40.649 --> 01:08:42.518
CALLED JUSTICE IN MOTION THAT

01:08:42.585 --> 01:08:46.489
WORKS WITH A NETWORK OF-

01:08:46.555 --> 01:08:47.723
FREQUENTLY THERE EITHER HUMAN

01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:48.891
RIGHTS LAWYERS IN THEIR HOME

01:08:48.958 --> 01:08:52.261
COUNTRIES WHO WORKS TO. TRACK

01:08:52.328 --> 01:08:54.497
FOLKS DOWN- AND THAT. AS AS I

01:08:54.563 --> 01:08:55.898
THINK YOUR QUESTION RIGHTLY

01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:57.833
ANTICIPATES- SOMEONE GIVES AND

01:08:57.900 --> 01:09:00.369
IT. IS A PAINSTAKING PROCESS-

01:09:00.436 --> 01:09:02.538
IT IS PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT IN

01:09:02.605 --> 01:09:04.507
A PANDEMIC AND HAS BEEN FROZEN

01:09:04.573 --> 01:09:05.975
AT DIFFERENT POINTS DEPENDING

01:09:06.041 --> 01:09:08.711
ON- LOCAL HEALTH CONDITIONS.

01:09:08.777 --> 01:09:09.645
AND IT IS ALSO EXTREMELY

01:09:09.712 --> 01:09:11.514
DIFFICULT GIVEN THE HURRICANES

01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:13.182
THAT PASSED THROUGH THOSE

01:09:13.249 --> 01:09:14.783
COUNTRIES AT THIS TIME SO I

01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:17.052
THINK THAT THAT BEGINS TO

01:09:17.119 --> 01:09:18.521
EXPLAIN SOME OF JUST THE- SHEER

01:09:18.587 --> 01:09:20.422
DIFFICULTIES BUT- IT DOES

01:09:20.489 --> 01:09:22.024
LITERALLY INVOLVED GOING TO

01:09:22.091 --> 01:09:24.093
COMMUNITIES. SPEAKING TO ELDERS

01:09:24.159 --> 01:09:26.061
AND COMMUNITIES USING WHATEVER

01:09:26.128 --> 01:09:28.130
SNIPPETS OF INFORMATION. ARE

01:09:28.197 --> 01:09:29.798
AVAILABLE LOOKING AT BIRTH

01:09:29.865 --> 01:09:33.802
REGISTRIES- AND SO ON AND SO ON

01:09:33.869 --> 01:09:37.072
AND THAT HAS YIELDED. RESULTS

01:09:37.139 --> 01:09:40.276
IT IS. LED TO DOZENS AND DOZENS

01:09:40.342 --> 01:09:42.378
OF FAMILIES FOUND BUT IT IS

01:09:42.444 --> 01:09:43.913
UNDERSTANDABLY QUITE SLOW.

01:09:43.979 --> 01:09:48.951
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. TO HAVE

01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:50.586

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF MY

01:09:54.323 --> 01:09:55.858

FOR DR MATHEW LOW IF I CAN. ON

01:09:59.161 --> 01:10:00.496
PAGE FIVE OF OUR BACKGROUND

01:10:00.563 --> 01:10:02.565
PAPERS TODAY IT STATES THAT

01:10:02.631 --> 01:10:03.666
CHILDREN WHO ARE SEPARATED FROM

01:10:03.732 --> 01:10:05.401
THEIR FAMILIES AT THE BORDER

01:10:05.467 --> 01:10:07.403
NOT ONLY FACE TRAUMA CAUSED BY

01:10:07.469 --> 01:10:08.437
DISRUPTIONS IN THEIR

01:10:08.504 --> 01:10:11.206
ATTACHMENT. TO CARING ADULTS

01:10:11.273 --> 01:10:12.875
BUT THEY ARE ALSO PROCESSING

01:10:12.942 --> 01:10:15.411
THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LED THEM

01:10:15.477 --> 01:10:17.046
TO SEEK ASYLUM IN THE FIRST

01:10:17.112 --> 01:10:19.081
PLACE SUCH AS WAR AND VIOLENCE

01:10:19.148 --> 01:10:21.083
IN THEIR HOME COUNTRIES. I WAS

01:10:21.150 --> 01:10:23.519

CAN. YOUR STATEMENTS FOR THAT

01:10:27.790 --> 01:10:29.792
THIS CAN LEAD TO LASTING

01:10:29.858 --> 01:10:32.361
PSYCHOLOGICAL HARM. BUT THAT

01:10:32.428 --> 01:10:34.196
THESE OUTCOMES ARE NOT YET

01:10:34.263 --> 01:10:36.165
DETERMINED. THAT YOU HAVE BEEN

01:10:36.231 --> 01:10:39.668
IMPRESSED BY THE RESILIENCY AND

01:10:39.735 --> 01:10:40.269
THE KIDS THAT YOU'VE SEEN. MY

01:10:40.336 --> 01:10:41.971

LAUER. IS THE EARLY DETECTION

01:10:44.506 --> 01:10:46.675
AND EARLY INTERVENTION IS KEY

01:10:46.742 --> 01:10:48.043
IN HELPING TO PREVENT AND

01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:50.145
REDUCE THE HEALTH RISKS

01:10:50.212 --> 01:10:51.480
ASSOCIATED WITH ADVERSE

01:10:51.547 --> 01:10:54.516
CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES OR ACES.

01:10:54.583 --> 01:10:57.019
CAN WE PROVIDE A SCREENINGS TWO

01:10:57.086 --> 01:10:57.886
ONE DOCUMENT A CHILDREN

01:10:57.953 --> 01:10:59.888
SEPARATED FROM THEIR FAMILIES

01:10:59.955 --> 01:11:01.857
TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE

01:11:01.924 --> 01:11:04.360
HEALTH. AND WELL BEING AND

01:11:04.426 --> 01:11:06.629
POTENTIALLY. PREVENTING THESE

01:11:06.695 --> 01:11:08.230
CHILDREN FROM DEVELOPING MENTAL

01:11:08.297 --> 01:11:09.632
ILLNESS SUCH AS ANXIETY

01:11:09.698 --> 01:11:12.267
DISORDERS DEPRESSION AND

01:11:12.334 --> 01:11:18.474
SUICIDAL IDEATIONS. YES THANK

01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:20.609
YOU VERY MUCH OF THE QUESTION

01:11:20.676 --> 01:11:22.711
FOR YOUR COMMENTS ON. AN

01:11:22.778 --> 01:11:24.780
ABSOLUTELY PART OF OUR CONCERN

01:11:24.847 --> 01:11:25.748
IS THAT WE KNOW THE STRESS AND

01:11:25.814 --> 01:11:27.549
TRAUMA IS CUMULATIVE SO IT'S

01:11:27.616 --> 01:11:29.385
NOT ABOUT JUST LOOKING AT ONE

01:11:29.451 --> 01:11:30.753
EXPERIENCE OF ADVERSITY OR

01:11:30.819 --> 01:11:32.454
TRAUMA AND ISOLATION JUST AND

01:11:32.521 --> 01:11:34.857
NEXT EXPERIENCE OF SEPARATION

01:11:34.923 --> 01:11:35.824
BUT TO LOOK AT THE PRODUCTS

01:11:35.891 --> 01:11:37.059
WHAT'S NEXT FOR THE MULTIPLE

01:11:37.126 --> 01:11:38.060
TRAUMAS ADVERSITIES THAT

01:11:38.127 --> 01:11:39.695
CHILDREN HAVE EXPERIENCED. WE

01:11:39.762 --> 01:11:41.196
KNOW THAT CHILDREN FAMILIES ARE

01:11:41.263 --> 01:11:43.065
FLEEING FROM VIOLENCE OR

01:11:43.132 --> 01:11:44.333
NATURAL DISASTER HAS BEEN

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.902
MENTIONED RIGHT SO- WE'RE VERY

01:11:46.969 --> 01:11:47.336
CONCERNED ABOUT THE

01:11:47.403 --> 01:11:52.441
ACCUMULATION. OF TRUNKS AND THE

01:11:52.508 --> 01:11:54.043
SPECIFIC. THE SPECIFICALLY. OF

01:11:54.109 --> 01:11:55.277
THE IMPACT OF SECTION WHICH

01:11:55.344 --> 01:11:56.311
AGAIN IS NOT JUST A ONE TIME

01:11:56.378 --> 01:11:58.113
THING BUT IT'S BEEN A LONG

01:11:58.180 --> 01:12:00.416
PROCESS FOR MANY MANY FAMILIES-

01:12:00.482 --> 01:12:02.484
HOW THAT INFORMS OUR EARTH X.

01:12:02.551 --> 01:12:04.019
THE DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORY.

01:12:04.086 --> 01:12:07.189
OF CHILDREN- AND WHEN WE SAY

01:12:07.256 --> 01:12:08.657
THAT THE OUTCOME WAS NOT TO

01:12:08.724 --> 01:12:10.759
DETERMINE THIS BECAUSE- MANY OF

01:12:10.826 --> 01:12:12.227
THESE CHILDREN AND EVEN INTO

01:12:12.294 --> 01:12:12.961
ADULTHOOD THERE REMAIN

01:12:13.028 --> 01:12:14.296
OPPORTUNITIES FOR HEALING AND

01:12:14.363 --> 01:12:17.866
RECOVERY. AND FOR- AGAIN

01:12:17.933 --> 01:12:19.668
ALTERING THE PATH THAT. I'M

01:12:19.735 --> 01:12:21.870
INTRODUCTORY COURSE POSITIVE

01:12:21.937 --> 01:12:24.873
OUTCOMES. ARE ABLE TAKING THAT

01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:26.809
EARLY INTERVENTION IS KEY

01:12:26.875 --> 01:12:28.777
EARLIER THAT WE CAN. CATCH AND

01:12:28.844 --> 01:12:32.081
ADDRESS- ANY DIFFICULTIES IF

01:12:32.147 --> 01:12:34.550
PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING- WHAT'S

01:12:34.616 --> 01:12:36.185
TRIMIX BORDER CHALLENGE THE

01:12:36.251 --> 01:12:37.686
LITTLE REGRESSIONS APPEARS KIND

01:12:37.753 --> 01:12:39.154
OF GOING BACK TO EARLIER STAGES

01:12:39.221 --> 01:12:40.556
OF FUNCTIONING. BUT IF WE CAN

01:12:40.622 --> 01:12:43.158
PROVIDE SAFETY STABILITY. SKILL

01:12:43.225 --> 01:12:45.794
BUILDING- THEN THAT. HELPED

IN TOWARDS HEALING. SO AGAIN.

01:12:52.401 --> 01:12:52.801

01:13:03.045 --> 01:13:04.413
EXPERIENCING TRAUMA ALTERS THAT

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:05.981

ESTABLISHED BY THE JUDGE. THIS

01:37:04.285 --> 01:37:05.486
MEANS THAT THE NEED FOR THE

BITING MINISTRATION TO CREATE

01:37:07.955 --> 01:37:09.890

01:37:32.846 --> 01:37:34.081
NOT FORCES PARENTS TO GO

BECAUSE THEIR CASES ARE STILL

01:53:48.988 --> 01:53:50.623
THEY COULD ADOPT HIM. AFTER

01:53:50.690 --> 01:53:52.692
THAT MOMENT I DID NOT KNOW

01:53:52.759 --> 01:53:53.626
ANYTHING ABOUT MY SON FOR TOO

01:53:53.693 --> 01:53:55.295
MUCH WHEN MY SON AND I WERE

01:53:55.361 --> 01:53:56.963
REUNITED HE TOLD ME THAT HE

01:53:57.030 --> 01:53:58.264
CRIED EVERY DAY BECAUSE HE

01:53:58.331 --> 01:54:00.166
MISSED ME SO MUCH HE WROTE ME

01:54:00.233 --> 01:54:01.668
LETTERS EVERY DAY AND HE ASKED

01:54:01.734 --> 01:54:03.269
I THINK TENSION CENTER OFFICERS

01:54:03.336 --> 01:54:04.671

01:54:04.737 --> 01:54:09.475

01:54:11.044 --> 01:54:12.111
IMAGINE HOW IT AFFECTED HIM AS

01:54:12.178 --> 01:54:13.880
A CHILD. EVERYTHING THAT

01:54:13.947 --> 01:54:15.448
HAPPENED TO US ON OUR JOURNEY.

01:54:15.515 --> 01:54:17.183
HAS HAD A MAJOR EFFECT ON OUR

01:54:17.250 --> 01:54:18.451
MENTAL HEALTH. WE WERE

01:54:18.518 --> 01:54:19.819
SEPARATED AND I WAS WITH OTHER

01:54:19.886 --> 01:54:21.187
PARENTS WHO ARE SEPARATED FROM

01:54:21.254 --> 01:54:22.689
THEIR CHILDREN. I TRIED TO BE

01:54:22.755 --> 01:54:23.923
STRONG FOR THEM. AND SUPPORT

01:54:23.990 --> 01:54:25.658
THE OTHER PARENT. BUT WHEN YOU

01:54:25.725 --> 01:54:26.993
START TO SEE OTHER PARENTS

01:54:27.060 --> 01:54:28.328
BEGIN TO WEAKEN AND BEGAN TO

01:54:28.394 --> 01:54:31.965
pWEAK AND SUFFER. MY HAIR

01:54:32.031 --> 01:54:33.933
STARTED TO FALL OUT FROM ALL

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:34.867
THE STRESS AND I HAD SEVERE

01:54:34.934 --> 01:54:36.569
HEADACHES. THE SEPARATION

01:54:36.636 --> 01:54:38.371
AFFECTED MICE AND GREATLY. AT

01:54:38.438 --> 01:54:39.239
THE BEGINNING HE WOULD HAVE

01:54:39.305 --> 01:54:40.773
DREAMS THAT WE WEREN'T TOGETHER

01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:44.310
AND WOULD WAKE UP. THINKING

01:54:44.377 --> 01:54:45.778
HE HAD MANY NIGHTMARES. I DON'T

01:54:45.845 --> 01:54:47.680
WAKE UP FEELING SCARED. WHEN I

01:54:47.747 --> 01:54:49.249
RECEIVED A CALL FROM SENECA AND

01:54:49.315 --> 01:54:50.183

01:54:52.285 --> 01:54:53.286
JOY FOR ME TO HEAR THAT THIS

01:54:53.353 --> 01:54:55.121

01:54:55.188 --> 01:54:56.556

01:54:58.057 --> 01:54:59.225

01:55:01.194 --> 01:55:01.861
I'VE NOTICED SIGNIFICANT

01:55:01.928 --> 01:55:03.930

THE STATE WE CANNOT STAND BY

02:07:15.661 --> 02:07:19.098
THIS TYPE OF A PROTOCOL. SO WE

02:07:19.164 --> 02:07:21.734
MUST CONSIDER THEM AS IT WAS

02:07:21.800 --> 02:07:24.036

02:07:37.683 --> 02:07:38.717
GOOD SORT OF WAITING THE GOOD

02:07:38.784 --> 02:07:39.752
AND THE BAD TO COME TO AN

02:07:39.818 --> 02:07:41.420
INFORMED UNDERSTANDING SO THAT

02:07:41.487 --> 02:07:42.988
THEY CAN MAKE CHOICES VERY

02:07:43.055 --> 02:07:44.089
TOUGH CHOICES. FOR THEIR

02:07:46.025 --> 02:07:47.693
NOT AVAILABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:07:47.760 --> 02:07:49.895

02:07:56.769 --> 02:07:59.038
THE WE HAVE PUT TOGETHER IS

02:07:59.104 --> 02:08:00.205
THAT WE BELIEVE THAT THE

02:08:00.272 --> 02:08:02.141
CALIFORNIA CAN HELP BECAUSE OUR

02:08:02.207 --> 02:08:05.244

02:08:05.310 --> 02:08:07.246
TO FOLLOW STATE LAW THE RIVER

02:08:07.312 --> 02:08:08.781
BELIEVE IT OR BECAUSE OF A-

02:08:08.847 --> 02:08:10.449
NEEDS THIS SORT OF CLARITY FROM

02:08:10.516 --> 02:08:12.484
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I

02:08:12.551 --> 02:08:14.853

02:08:14.920 --> 02:08:16.455
POLICIES AND PRACTICES. AND

02:08:16.522 --> 02:08:18.190

02:08:32.504 --> 02:08:33.572
MUCH OF LIKE WHAT IT ALREADY

DOES IN IN THE STATE SYSTEM.

02:08:36.775 --> 02:08:38.544
WELL WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT

02:08:38.610 --> 02:08:40.212
THERE'S THE ISSUE OF REFUSAL OF

02:08:40.279 --> 02:08:42.714
MEDICATION MANY OF THE CHILDREN

02:08:42.781 --> 02:08:43.816
WHO MIGHT NOT HAVE TOLD ME THAT

02:08:43.882 --> 02:08:45.084
WHEN THEY REFUSE MEDICATIONS

02:08:45.150 --> 02:08:46.552

02:08:49.988 --> 02:08:51.290
THEY CAN BE AN ADVERSE IMPACT

02:08:51.356 --> 02:08:53.125
FOR THEM TO REACH YOU REFUSE TO

02:08:53.192 --> 02:08:54.827
TAKE THE MEDICATION SO NOT ONLY

02:08:54.893 --> 02:08:55.794
SHOULD THERE BE INFORMED

02:08:55.861 --> 02:08:57.129
CONSENT PROCEDURES BUT THERE

02:08:57.196 --> 02:08:58.697
SHOULD BE AN UNDERTAKING TO

02:08:58.764 --> 02:09:00.332
DEVELOP PROPER PROTOCOLS FOR

IN THIS IS OF CRUCIAL

02:16:17.269 --> 02:16:18.270
IMPORTANCE IN PROTECTING

CHILDREN IN OUR STATE IS

02:16:19.971 --> 02:16:21.540
STRENGTHENING THE LICENSING

02:16:26.411 --> 02:16:27.712
THAT WE AS A STATE ARE

02:16:27.779 --> 02:16:30.715

WHEN COMPARED TO FACILITIES AND

OTHER STATES. BUT THAT DOES NOT

02:16:38.890 --> 02:16:40.525
MEAN THAT THERE IS NOT ROOM FOR

02:16:40.592 --> 02:16:42.494
SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT. IT'S

02:16:42.561 --> 02:16:44.262
OUR SUGGESTION THAT CALIFORNIA

02:16:44.329 --> 02:16:45.764

HUMANITY. IN ORDER TO DO THIS

02:16:57.809 --> 02:16:59.578
CALIFORNIA SHOULD ENSURE THAT

BUT IT'S ALSO A KEY ENTRY POINT

02:19:19.951 --> 02:19:21.252
AND LINKING FAMILIES NEW TO

02:20:07.365 --> 02:20:08.600

02:23:47.685 --> 02:23:49.354
ISSUE THAT THIS LEGISLATURE

02:23:49.420 --> 02:23:50.655
CERTAINLY HAS BEEN TRACKING

02:23:50.722 --> 02:23:51.889
OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS.

DO NEXT. ON THE TABLE AND FOR

02:23:57.195 --> 02:23:58.262
US TO CONSIDER. I THINK THAT

02:23:58.329 --> 02:24:01.532
THE MOST HELPFUL THING. IS THE

02:24:01.599 --> 02:24:02.767
CHANGE IN TONE COMING OUT OF

02:24:02.834 --> 02:24:04.268
WASHINGTON RIGHT NOW AND IF

02:24:04.335 --> 02:24:07.138
THEY WILL. TAKE A SERIOUS RUN

02:24:07.205 --> 02:24:07.605
AT ADDRESSING SOMEBODY

02:24:07.672 --> 02:24:10.241
IMMIGRATION ERROR ISSUES. I

02:24:10.308 --> 02:24:10.942
HAVE DEVELOPED OVER THE LAST

02:24:11.009 --> 02:24:11.943
NUMBER OF YEARS AND I THINK

02:24:12.010 --> 02:24:16.080
THAT MAKES. OUR JOB. EASIER BUT

02:24:16.147 --> 02:24:17.715
IT IS DISHEARTENING TO SEE THE

02:24:17.782 --> 02:24:19.817
DESTRUCTION THAT STILL EXISTS.

02:24:19.884 --> 02:24:21.819

02:24:33.731 --> 02:24:34.699

02:24:57.822 --> 02:24:59.657
AS CLEAR THAT THE EXPERIENCE OF

FORCE FAMILY SEPARATION WILL

02:25:01.659 --> 02:25:03.294
HAVE A LASTING IMPACT ON THESE

02:25:03.361 --> 02:25:04.929
