THIS IS CRITICAL IF THE STATE IS GOING TO MEET ITS ANNUAL GOAL OF TREATING FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES TO PREVENT WILDFIRES BEFORE HARVESTING TIMBER ON PRIVATE LAND LAND OWNERS MUST SUBMIT A TIMBER HARVESTING PLAN PREPARED BY PROFESSIONAL FORESTERS FIVE EIGHT BY REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL FORESTERS THAT OUTLINED THE SIZE SCOPE LOCATION AND METHOD OF THE HARVEST HOWEVER LANDOWNERS MAY BE EXEMPT FROM THIS REQUIREMENT IF THE TIMBER HARVEST REDUCES THE RATE. DURATION FIRED AGAIN BILL FIRED MISSION AND INTENSITY OF FIRE SPREAD THE CURRENT FORCE FIRE PREVENTION PILOT PROJECT EXEMPTION HAS ENABLED PRIVATE FOREST LANDOWNERS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE STATE'S MISSION OF PREVENTING FUTURE FIRES AND DAMPENING THEIR INTENSITY WITHOUT THE EXTENSION OF THE PROGRAMFORCED THAT CAN TO BE GRAFT AND BUILD WITH IT AND.

DANIEL VARADA AND BRIAN NO WIKI. HELLO CAN YOU HEAR ME YES. OKAY GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS DANIEL BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA IN OPPOSITION TO AB FIVE TWENTY TWO WHICH WOULD EXTEND THE FOREST FIRE PREVENTION EXTENSION PREVENTION EXEMPTION IN THE TIMBER HARVEST PLAN EXEMPTION THAT ALLOWS FOR TREES TO BE REMOVED WITHOUT AND FIREMEN OR B. L. T. H. P. AND ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT LOGGING OPERATIONS. DO NOT DAMAGED ECOSYSTEMS WILDLIFE OR WATER QUALITY. WITHOUT T. H. B. TO REMOVAL OPERATIONS HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR SUBSTANTIAL AND EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO FORSAKE. WILDLIFE HABITAT. BOILS DOWN AND WHY AND- BUT REASONS WE OPPOSE THIS EXEMPTION WHEN I WAS ORIGINALLY BY THE LEGISLATURE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND WE MUST OPPOSE THE EXTENSION. ACTING COMMUNITIES AND PERFECT FOR SPEAKER SYSTEMS AND MITIGATING WILDFIRES WILL TAKE FULL COORDINATED PLANNING. THP IS SHOULD BE VIEWED AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE PLANNING PROCESS THEN SHARED STORAGE PROJECTS DO NOT HAVE UNINTENDED AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE CONSEQUENCES RATHER THAN AS IMPEDIMENTS TO THIS PROJECT AB FIVE TWENTY TWO RUNS COUNTER TO THE PURPOSES OF THE FACT THAT. COMMUNITY PROTECTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION WITH DANGEROUS IMPLICATIONS ABOUT. WE OPPOSE THIS BELL AND ACTOR AND HELP OUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I'M NEXT- WE HAVE BRIAN NO WIKI. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME BRIAN WE KEY CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY I'M LOOKING AT THAT TECHNICAL HANG UP IS JUST SHAKING OFF THE DUST. OF LAST YEAR AS WE GET INTO THIS NEXT YEAR I COULD SEE THAT COULD CARRY OUT THIS AFTERNOON- YES I AM ALSO SPEAKING IN OPPOSITION TO A. B. FIVE Q. TWO- I UNDERSTAND THE INTENTION. OF THE BILL BUT I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT AFFECTED. FIRE PREVENTION IS POSSIBLE ONLY WITH PLANNING. AND THAT'S TO FACT ABOUT THAT PROVIDE. CONNECTION ACROSS PROPERTIES AND COORDINATION SO THAT THOSE VARIOUS PROJECTS HAPPEN. IN TIMING THAT MAKES SENSE TO PROVIDE FOR FIRE PREVENTION PREVENTION IT FEELS PROJECTS WHICH HAVE A LIMITED LIFESPAN WHEN THEY'RE IMPLEMENTED ON THE GROUND HAS TO BE DONE IN A COORDINATED WAY TO BE EFFECTIVE BOTH SPATIALLY AND IN TIME I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT THE PILOT PROJECT WAS TO ALLOW NUMBER OF PROJECTS TO GO THROUGH IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME WITH OUR LEAD TIME OF SOME OF THAT PLANNING- BUT- AN EXTENSION. MAKING THIS PERMANENT AND THE CONTINUING TO GO FORWARD WITHOUT HAVING WITHOUT ALLOWING FOR THIS PLANNING BOTH TO PROTECT THE RESOURCES AND TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ACHIEVING THE GOALS- WORKS NOT ONLY DOES THAT MAKE SENSE AND ISN'T NECESSARY BUT IT ACTUALLY WORKS AGAINST THE INTENTIONS. OF ACTIVE FIRE PREVENTION FOR THESE REASONS AND STANDING WITH CENTER CORRECT THE SIERRA CLUB CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY VERY MUCH POSES- THIS PERMANENT. EXTENSION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I DON'T. I BELIEVE THERE NO ONE IN THE HEARING ROOM. AS A WITNESS ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS. YES THANK YOUNG MANAGER- SORRY LITTLE BIT OUT OF PRACTICE HERE NONE CALIFORNIA STATE BANK WAS ONE THE REGISTER THEIR SUPPORT AND I THOUGHT THAT THEY MIGHT BE ON THE LINE- BUT THEY OPERATE WITH SOME OF THE ISSUES WHERE THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO GET THROUGH SO.

GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS CHRIS ROSE- ON BEHALF OF HEALTH FORESTS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK YOU. WE HAVE NO OTHER LINES INTO AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU OPERATOR ANY QUESTIONS ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MISTER WHAT. YES A QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR- IS THIS A BIT IT WAS A WAS MENTIONED BY ONE WITNESSES THIS IS PERMANENT NOW IS THAT RIGHT NOT MY READING OF THIS- THE- IF I CAN ANSWER TO THE CHAIR OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN AS I ACKNOWLEDGE AT THE BEGINNING EXTENDS THE EXEMPTION EFFECTIVE DATE TO JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY SIX OKAY THAT'S SIMPLE I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION THANK YOU. YEAH THAT WAS GOING TO ADDRESS AND I CLOSE BUT YES YES THE AUTHOR AGREED. TO THAT AMENDMENT. ANY OTHER. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. OKAY WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES- YOU KNOW JUST TO- JUST ADDRESS THE OPPOSITION WHEN YOU APPLY FOR AN EXEMPTION- THERE THE EXEMPTION STILL REQUIRE ALL THE FORCE PRACTICE RULES TO BE MET- IT REQUIRES A NOTICE FILED WITH THE DEPARTMENT THAT REQUIRES AN INSPECTION- THE EXEMPTION IS LIMITED TO HARVESTING THOSE TREES THAT ELIMINATE THE VERTICAL CONTINUITY HAVE IT SHOULD HAVE FUELS AND HORIZONTAL CONTINUITY OF TREE GROUNDS FOR REDUCING THE RATE OF FIRE SPREAD TO RACIAL INTENSITY- THEY CAN IGNITION OF. A TREE CROWNS THE EXEMPTION CONTAINS SPECIFIC PROTECTIONS FOR WATER COURSES- THE REMAINING TREES DANCE IMITATIONS IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF TEMPORARY ROADS AND REQUIRES A REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL FORESTER TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SUBMITTING THE NOTICE OF EXEMPTION- EXECUTIVES OF THE PROJECT REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN 60% OF FORCE CANOPIES INCREASE THE AVERAGE STAND AMMETER- THE LIMITS AND THE LIMITS ON ROAD CONSTRUCTION ARE DESIGNED TO PROTECT WATERSHEDS SO THERE ARE CLEARLY PROTECTIONS EXISTED AND OF COURSE. AS AS INDICATED WITH THE AMENDMENTS AGAIN THESE ARE LOW LIMIT THESE EXEMPTIONS ARE LIMITED TO THREE OR ACRES OR LESS SO- THIS IS TO ENSURE SOME STABILITY AND CONTINUITY SO THAT- PRIVATE LANDOWNERS WHO CURRENTLY ACTIVE MANAGE TO EARN FIFTY THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES ALREADY SO WE NEED TO ENCOURAGE. PRIVATE LANDOWNERS TO DO MORE- THEY ARE A VITAL STAKEHOLDER IN AND OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN OUR FORCES LANDS. SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR ABOUT. THANK YOU. SO WE HAVE A MODE. FROM MR FLORES SECONDED BY MR MATHIS THE MOTION. IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS. I'M SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. RIVAS I RIVAS I FLOOR FLOOR I BENNETT. GARCIA AYE GARCIA AYE MATHIS- MATHIS AYE MCCARTY AYE MCCARTY AYE MURATSUCHI MURATSUCHI AYE RADIUS AYEREYES ICY ARCTIC. STONE STONE NO WOULD WHAT I. THE BILL HAS EIGHT BUT WE'LL LEAVE IT OPEN FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THIS YEAR- OKAY SO NEXT WE'LL MOVE ON TO ITEM FOR. AB FIFTEEN NINETEEN BY MR GALLAGHER. THE. MOVE WILL. PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS PRESHEAF YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS BILL TODAY AB FIFTEEN NINETEEN- AS YOU KNOW- WE'VE REALLY BEEN WORKING ON THIS WILDFIRE. ISSUE IN PREVENTION- AND SIGNIFICANT FUNDING IN THE BUDGET. LAST YEAR THAT WILL GO INTO DOING THE MUCH NEEDED ACTIVITIES INCLUDING SENDING- MECHANICAL. FORESTRY MANAGEMENT- PRESCRIBED FIRE MANY DIFFERENT METHODS TO ENSURE THAT WE GET OUR FORCE INTO A HEALTHIER CAN CONDITION GET A LOT OF THE BRUSH AND FUEL LOADS- THAT MAKE OUR- FORCE A TINDER BOX WAITING TO HAPPEN. AND HELP AVOID- DEVASTATING FIRES LIKE IN PARADISE LIKE IN GREENVILLE. LIKE IN BERRY CREEK- IN MY PART OF THE STATE- BUT THE ONE THE ONE BIG THING THAT WE HAVE BEEN MISSING- AND THAT IS A VERY MUCH A PART OF THIS PICTURE IS BIOMASS AND REALLY INCENTIVIZING BIOMASS PLANTS- BECAUSE YOU CAN YOU CAN GET IN THERE AND DO THE WORK OF. REMOVING THE BRUSH AND THE- AND THE DEAD AND DYING TREES BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PLACE TO TAKE IT. AND THE REALITY IS NOW WE HAVE WE DO NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY. TO TAKE THAT WOULD YOU WASTE AND DO SOMETHING WITH IT THAT IS MUCH BETTER THAN WHAT THE ALTERNATIVES ARE RIGHT NOW- WE HAD SIXTY SIX BIOMASS PLANTS- AT. SO WE'VE LOST IT TWO THIRDS OF THAT CAPACITY TO TAKE THIS ON SO WHAT FIFTEEN NINETEEN DOES IT PROVIDES AN INCENTIVE. TO HELP ENSURE THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE BIOMASS FACILITIES THAT CAN TAKE IN THIS WAY IS THE BIGGEST COST DRIVER AND HERE'S HOW IT WORKS RIGHT NOW A LOT OF TIMES BY MASS. IS OPERATING TO PRODUCE ELECTRICITY- BUT THEY ONLY GET PAID SO MUCH FOR THAT ELECTRICITY PRODUCED IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO COVER THE COSTS. AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST COST DRIVERS IS TRANSPORTATION IT'S GETTING. YOU KNOW THE- THIS WOULD BE WAYS FROM THE FORCE VERY REMOTE AREAS- TO THE BIOMASS PLANTS. I LOOK I WANT TO WORK ON US GETTING MANY OF THESE BIOMASS PLANTS IN THESE AREAS IN THESE COMMUNITIES AND THAT'S ALSO PART OF THIS BECAUSE THIS COULD HELP INCENTIVIZE THAT- BUT WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE INCENTIVIZING AGAIN AND- RATING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE THESE BIOMASS PLANTS. TO BE CREATED- AND HERE'S THE ALTERNATIVE AND THIS IS THE REALITY THAT WE'RE FACING RIGHT NOW IS IF WE ARE NOT TAKING THIS WOULD BE WASTE. TO BIOMASS FACILITIES IS EITHER GOING TO BE OPEN BURNED IN A IN A FIRE WHICH IS THE WORST ALTERNATIVE AND LAST YEAR ALONE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION METRIC TONS OF CARBON- WERE EMITTED INTO OUR ATMOSPHERE BY DEVASTATING WILDFIRES IT KEEPS GETTING APPAN ACTUALLY BIGGER- FOR THEY'RE JUST GONNA BE LEFT AS A BRUSH PILE SOMEWHERE ON SOME PROPERTY- A RECENT. STUDY HAS SHOWN THAT AS COMPARED TO THOSE ALTERNATIVES- BIOMASS A FACTUAL ENSURES THAT AT BIOMASS ENERGY GENERATION RESULTS IN NINETY EIGHT TO NINETY PERCENT. 99% LOWER PM TWO FIVE- THAT CARBON MONOXIDE METHANE AND BLACK CARBON EMISSIONS COMPARED TO OPEN PILE BURNING. WILL BE DOING A SUBSTANTIAL THING FOR THE CLIMATE BY ENSURING THAT WE HAVE THESE BIOMASS FACILITIES- IN PLACE NOW I'VE- AND THIS IS WHERE I WANT TO TALK TO MY FELLOW COMMITTEE MEMBERS IS I REALLY THINK WE CAN GET SOMEWHERE ON THIS BILL. AND I AM COMMITTED TO TAKING AMENDMENTS THAT ADDRESS THE TWO PRIMARY ISSUES BROUGHT UP IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. ONE WAS THAT THESE WOULD NOT BE. INCENTIVIZING BIOMASS IN AREAS WHERE WE HAVE NON ATTAINMENT I'M I'M AGREEABLE TO TAKEN THAT AMOUNT- AND A LOT OF THESE AREAS WERE WERE TRYING TO GET MORE BIOMASS. MOST OF MY DISTRICT IS ENTERTAINMENT RIGHT NOW- MANY OF THE AREAS WHERE WE NEED TO BRING ON NEW BIOMASS PLANTS THERE IN. ATTAINMENT AFTER THEY'RE A QUALITY GOALS. SO I'M GOING TO TAKE AMENDMENTS YOU KNOW TO ENSURE THEY DON'T GO TO NON ATTAINMENT AREAS UNLESS THE LOCAL AIRBOARD. WITH THEIR OWN PLAN AND PROJECT IS AMENABLE TO IT- AND THEN THE SECOND ONE IS WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE THOSE THAT ALREADY HAVE THE NINE OH ONE CONTRACTS. AND ALREADY GETTING SOME INCENTIVE FROM THAT TO GET IT. TO GET THIS INCENTIVE I'M FINE WITH TAKING NOT AMENDMENT- SO LONG AS THEY COULD APPLY FOR ONCE THEIR CONTRACT IS UP- AND SO THAT YOU KNOW ONCE THAT CONTRACT IS OVER THEN THEY COULD. THEN UTILIZE IT BUT THIS IS REALLY FOCUSED ON THOSE THAT DON'T HAVE NINE OH ONE CONTRACTS. THAT ARE ENTERTAINED AIR ATTAINMENT AREAS AND TO INCENTIVIZE THE NEW BECAUSE WE NEED MORE CAPACITY WE NEED MORE PLANTS. AND THE BIGGEST THING THAT'S GOING TO HELP BRING THOSE COME ONLINE. WE'VE DONE THIS FOR SOLAR WE SUBSIDIZE SOLAR AND NOW WE HAVE A BURGEONING SOLAR INDUSTRY IN THE STATE. WE SUBSIDIZE WIND NOW WE HAVE A BURGEONING STE WIND ENERGY. IN THE STATE. THIS IS A KEY STEP TO THE COULD REALLY GROW BY A MASTER'S NEW TECHNOLOGIES COMING ON EVERY DAY IN THIS FIELD- TALK WITH PEOPLE UC BERKELEY AND OTHER INSTITUTES- THEY'RE COMING UP WITH TECHNOLOGY WHERE WILL BE ZERO EMISSION- BIOMASS. BIOMASS PRODUCTION THAT COULD CREATE HYDROGEN. THE CLEAN HYDROGEN THAT WE CAN USE. IN OTHER CAPACITIES OF THIS IS REALLY THE KEY. WE'VE GOT A CRACK THIS NUT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO GET OUT THE PROBLEM. AND ASK FOR YOUR HELP WITH THIS AGAIN I'M WILLING TO TAKE THOSE AMENDMENTS- TO ADDRESS THE MAJOR CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN ADDRESSING THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. AND I HOPE THAT I CAN GET YOUR SUPPORT- FROM MOVING THIS FOR TODAY. THANK YOU. I DO HAVE. SOME WITNESSES ON THE PHONE- ONE IS SUPERVISOR DOUG TEETER. WHO DOES A FANTASTIC JOB REPRESENTING BE COUNTY BUT IS ALSO A- PARADISE CAN'T FIRE SURVIVOR- AND DOES THIS ISSUE WELL AND JOHN KENNEDY- WITH RC RC. THANK YOU HI WE ARE READY FOR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OPERATOR. CAN YOU PLEASE WITNESSES. ALL THOSE ARE MISTER PETERS LINE IS OPEN THOSE OF THOSE WHOSE LINE YOUR WITNESSES ARE ALREADY OPEN. ARE YOU CALLING FOR THE PUBLIC AT THIS POINT. NO I'M DOUG SUPERVISOR DOUG TEETER. I'M HERE IF YOU CAN HEAR ME YES WE CAN PLEASE GO AHEAD. OKAY THANK YOU- I CAN'T WAIT TELL US ALL THESE CO HIT THE ISSUES ARE BEHIND US- HOPEFULLY SOON- YES I'D LIKE TO SUPPORT THE BILL THAT JAMES GALLAGHER- HAS MENTIONED- BUTTE COUNTY SUPERVISOR I'M ALSO ON OUR FIRE SAFE COUNCILS A BOARD MEMBER. AND A PARADISE RESIDENT UP CURRENTLY- A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE JUST- BURNING FUELS- THAT. BUT THE ARMS OF THE CAMPFIRE ON THEIR PROPERTY- PRETTY EXPENSIVE TO- GET THINGS AN HOUR AND A HALF TO GO TO WHEELABRATOR- TO PUT IT IN A PILE BASS SO- ADS FOR YOUR YES VOTE AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU NEXT READY FOR JOHN KENNEDY. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME'S JOHN KENNEDY AND I'M WITH THE RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA RC RC IS COMPRISED OF THIRTY EIGHT WORLD COUNTIES AND WE'RE PLEASED TO SUPPORT AB FIFTEEN NINETEEN TODAY. OUR MEMBER COUNTIES OF REALLY SUFFERED A LOT OF THE STATE'S MOST CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES OVER THE LAST DECADE AND WE AGREE WITH- THE AUTHORS NOTE ABOUT GHG EMISSIONS FROM WILDFIRES- FOUR MILLION ACRES AND NINETY MILLION MTRIC TONS OF EMISSIONS IN TWENTY TWENTY THAT'S MORE THAN ALL THE EMISSIONS FROM INDUSTRIAL SOURCES ANNOUNCED ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WILDFIRE RISK REDUCTION IN FUEL MANAGEMENT IS SO IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE'S OBJECTIVES. SO WE'RE PLEASED TO SUPPORT THE BILL BECAUSE WE THINK IT'LL HELP IMPROVE COMMUNITY WILDFIRE PROTECTION REMOVED FUEL PILES FROM THE FOREST AND IMPORTANTLY REDUCE LOCAL AIR QUALITY IMPACT IN PARTICULAR TAKES TO PROVIDE A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO HELP GET SOME OF THE MATERIAL- THAT WOULD BE TO GRANTS PASS OUT OF THE FORCE TO THE TIME OUT THE SOUL IS. SO I WON'T GO BACK ON WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE MATERIAL- WITHOUT PARAMOUNT'S DISABILITIES BECAUSE IT'S LEFT TO BURN OR TO- DEGRADE NATURALLY AND THAT GIVES OFF OFF A LOT OF EMISSIONS THAT- THE RECENT STUDY REFERENCED BY POTTER COUNTY OR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT UC BERKELEY UC DAVIS THE US FOREST SERVICE SHOWN A REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY THAT THERE ARE MANY MORE SMALLER BY ABOUT THE FILTERS THAT ARE COMING ONLINE AND A LOT OF THE RURAL AREAS- AND THESE FACILITIES OFTENTIMES DO HAVE SOME BETTER EMISSIONS CONTROL DEVICES- AND WE THINK THIS WOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR THAT YOU KNOW ALSO ON. THE COMMISSION HOUSES RIGHT UP THE BY RAMMING THE BIO MAT PROGRAMS THAT LEVERAGE BY MATHIS SALAS REPETITIVE MANAGED FIFTEEN NINETEEN DIFFERENT AND IMPORTANT RESPECTS BECAUSE THE FACILITIES THAT PARTICIPATE IN THOSE PROGRAMS. ARE FOR ON PEOPLE'S COULDN'T PROVIDE THEM. EIGHT FIFTEEN. FOCUS ON MATERIALS THAT FARTHER AWAY FROM THE TO SELL. AND BY PHONE INTO ON BY. LOCATED MILES PER MILES OR MORE FROM FACILITY. THE WILL HELP MORE CAN UNDER FUEL MANAGEMENT PROJECTS THAT THEY NEED UNDER TO SERVE. AND REDUCE THE ERA IS. WITH THOSE PROJECTS OFFERED. BY THE AUTHOR TO STRIKE A NICE BALANCE UNDER ARE SIMILAR IN SCOPE TO WHAT WAS- IN AB THREE FORTY THREE BY SESSION- BY MR PATTERSON. AND STRONGLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY ON FIFTEEN NINETEEN THANK YOU FOR YOUR INDULGENCE. THANK YOU NEXT ALREADY FOR WITNESSES IN% OPPOSITION- WE HAVE DANIEL BROAD FROM THE SIERRA CLUB. AND BRIAN NO WIKI FROM THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY. GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN DANIEL BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF THEIR CLUB CALIFORNIA IN OPPOSITION AB FIFTEEN CAN. THE BILL WOULD USE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND TO PROVIDE GRANTS FOR TREES TO BE TRANSPORTED FROM THE FORESTS TO POLLUTING BIOMASS GENERATORS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. CALIFORNIA'S GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND IS INTENDED TO SUBSIDIZE PROGRAMS THAT REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. AND ACHIEVE CO BENEFITS AND COMMUNITY AT THE UPPER AIR QUALITY IMPACTS OF DIRTY ENERGY MONTHS BOTH OF THESE CALLS USING STATE FUNDS TO TRANSPORT BIOMASS WITH POLLUTING DIESEL TRUCKS. TO COMMUNITY IS FOR IN CALIFORNIA'S MOST POLLUTING AIR AND WHERE THE BIOMASS PLANT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO LOCAL AIR POLLUTION AND MAKE SOME OF THE STATE'S STURDIEST AND MOST EXPENSIVE ENERGY. ALL OF THIS IS A CLEAR AND THAT NAY. SO THE CLIMATE AND- CALIFORNIA'S BIG BIOMASS GENERATORS AND A AND I'M AT LARGE AMOUNTS OF FINE PROTECT MATTER. AND THAT NIGHT TRAP AND OXIDE OF NITROGEN WHICH IS A PRECURSOR. CALIFORNIA IS AIMING TO REDUCE ITS GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS CLEAN IT THERE AND REDUCE ITS VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED PARTICULARLY MILES TRAVELED BY DIESEL TRUCKS. FUNDING TRANSPORTATION OF CARBON BY A DIESEL TRUCK FROM CALIFORNIA'S FOR IT TO BE AND GENERATED AND THIRTY FOOT BUT IT. AND SOME OF THEM THAT AND IN COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN THE MOST OVERBURDENED BY AIR POLLUTION. IS IN DIRECT. TO CALIFORNIA'S VALUES AND FEDERAL AIR QUALITY APPLICATION. AND THEY'RE CUT CALIFORNIA OPPOSES AB FIFTEEN NINETEEN AND ASKED ABOUT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU- NEXT BRIAN A WIKI. YES A GOOD AFTERNOON BRIAN A WIKI CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY ALSO IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL- THE WHOLE ORGANIC KNOWLEDGE THAT THE BILL ANALYSIS BY THE COMMITTEE REALLY DID. REALLY DID POINT OUT SOME OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WITH THIS BILL AND I AND I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEES- EFFORTS TO OFFICER AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS THOSE AND THOSE ARE. THOSE ARE SMART WAYS OF TRYING TO REDUCE SOME OF THE BIGGEST NEGATIVE AFFECTS OF THIS BILL- THAT SAID. IS IT AS MENTIONED OFTEN ENOUGH THIS AND I THINK IT KNOWLEDGE OF PARENTS WE TALK ABOUT THE WERE ALREADY PAYING BOTTOM THE BANK TWO AND A HALF TIME AS MUCH IT REQUIRING REPAIRS TO BE TWO AND A HALF TIMES AS MUCH FOR ENERGY COMING FROM BIOMASS AS THEY ARE FROM OTHER ENERGY SOURCES IN CALIFORNIA THAT IS WE ARE YOU DUMPING A LOT OF MONEY. INTO BIOMASS AND PROPPING IT UP- WITH A LOT OF REPAIR MONEY TO THROW THIS TAXPAYER MONEY IN ON TOP OF IT TAKING IT AWAY FROM GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION EFFORTS AND PUTTING IT INTO BIOMASS SPECIFICALLY AND EVEN WORSE INTO TRANSPORTING BY DIESEL TO THOSE BIOMASS FACILITIES AT POTENTIALLY AT LONG DISTANCES IS PROBABLY. NOT HELPING THE PROBLEM SO ANY OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HEAR TOGETHER ARE TRYING TO SOLVE- AND THEN THE LAST THING TO SAY IS THAT- LONG DISTANCE TRANSPORT OF THE FUELS THERE'S MANY PROBLEMS WITH FINANCE AND MANY OF THEM ARE MADE MORE DIFFICULT WHEN YOU SAY WE'RE GOING TO INCREASE THE DISTANCES THAT WE'RE GONNA BE MOVE THIS BOTTOM AROUND THE. THANK YOU VERY. THE CENTER FOR ABOUT DIVERSITY. IN OPPOSITION THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU I'M NEXT WILL. WITH AND OVERSEAS OPEN UP TO WITNESSES IN THE ROOM AND OR ALL PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AFFILIATION AND YOUR POSITION ON THIS BILL GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR CHRIS MAKAYLA ON BEHALF OF HUMBOLDT MENDOCINO REDWOOD COMPANY'S IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB FIFTEEN NINETEEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OKAY I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN THE ROOM OPERATOR CAN YOU OPEN THE LINES TO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION OF AB. FIFTEEN NINETEEN. THANK YOU TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION OF FIFTEEN OF AB FIFTY NINETEEN PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. WELL FIRST GO TO LINE FIFTY ONE- GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS- RICHARD STILL GETS ON BEHALF OF THE SITUATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. WILL MOVE ON TO LINE TEN. GO AHEAD PLEASE ON BEHALF CHRIS ROSA ON BEHALF OF KELP FORESTS IN STRONG SUPPORT. IN MADAM CHAIR WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN QUEUE AT THE TOP. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MISTER MURATSUCHI. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR GALLAGHER FIRST I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOUR TIRELESS EFFORTS TO FIGHT FOR YOUR COMMUNITIES LIKE I KNOW THAT I'M JUST ONE OF MANY. MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE- WHO FOLLOW YOUR LEAD IN THE TOUR OF PARADISE AFTER- THE FIRE THERE AND- AND I KNOW THAT WE'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT TO. THE URGENCY OF- FIGHTING WILDFIRES THROUGH FORCE MANAGEMENT- PRESCRIBED BURNS THINNING AND ALL OTHER TOOLS THAT WE HAVE. ARE AVAILABLE TO US. ARM WHICH IS THE REASON WHY. YOU KNOW I MEAN START COMPARE YOUR BILL TO THE PREVIOUS BILL YOUR YOUR- BILL WITH MR FONG BUT NORMALLY I DON'T VOTE. YOU KNOW A FOR BILL. THE SIERRA CLUB IN THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY POSES- BUT I VOTED FOR MR FONG A BILL. BUT I AM HAVING PROBLEMS WITH WITH YOUR BILL- I MEAN IT'S JUST THE PRINCIPAL ON THE CONCEPT AS OF SPENDING. G. R. F. FUNDS THAT WERE DESIGNED TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS. YOU KNOW FOR A- DIESEL TRUCKS. ASIA YOU KNOW- THE TRANSPORTING CARE. VIA THE WHAT PRODUCTS. THAT HAVE BEEN CUT DOWN AS PART OF THE FOR THE FOR STANDING. YOU KNOW IT IT JUST. I WANT TO. YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT I MAY NOT SHARE THE SAME PASSION AND LEVEL OF COMMITMENT TO FIGHTING WILDFIRES AS AS YOU TO BE GIVEN THE COMMUNITIES THAT YOU REPRESENT BUT THE THIS BILL I MEAN UNLESS THE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AN AMENDMENT WORDS EUROPE BILLS- FUNDS ARE NOT GOING TO HELP OUT WITH THE TRANSPORTATION- YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK I CAN GET THERE BUT- WANT TO SEE IF HE HAD IN RESPONSE TO THAT. YEAH I APPRECIATE THAT- ASSEMBLY MEMBER- AND THANK YOU FOR. YOUR ATTENTION AND THAT MAN FOR COMING UP AND SEEN- YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE CAMPFIRE AND YOU HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW SUPPORT OF THE EFFORTS TO REALLY HELP US. IN THAT RESPECT SO AND I REALLY APPRECIATE I THINK THE THING THAT I WOULD. HAVE YOU THINK ABOUT. IT IN RESPONSE TO YOUR CONCERN. IS THAT IF WE DON'T SUBSIDIZE THIS AND HAVE THIS GO INTO A BIOMASS FACILITY TREES THAT WE THAT WE CUT DOWN AND THEN NOW IT HAS NOWHERE TO GO WHICH MEANS IT WILL EITHER JUST BE LEFT THERE ON THE FOURTH FLOOR. OR IT WILL BE. SENT TO A PLACE WHERE THEY OPEN BURN IT. IN WHICH CASE IN EITHER CASE THAT'S A MUCH WORSE RESULTS. FOR THE ENVIRONMENT- BECAUSE ONCE THAT'S BURNED YOU KNOW THIS THE STUDY THAT IT WAS REFERENCE UC BERKELEY UC DAVIS. HAS SAID THAT'S YOU KNOW 9899% MORE PM THAT'S GOING INTO THE AIR- IT'S GOING INTO THE AIR SO- I THINK WE ALL AGREE WE GOT TO GET THAT STUFF OUT OF THE FORCE CAUSES IT MAKES IT. SO MUCH MORE FIRE PRONE BUT OUR PROBLEM IS YOU GOTTA GET IT SOMEWHERE TO WHERE IT'S GOING TO BE DISPOSED OF AND- IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE AND THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IS BIOMASS NOW. THE TECHNOLOGY IS GETTING BETTER TOO I MEAN THE TECHNOLOGY CAN BETTER WHERE WE CAN ALTERNATELY HAVE PLANTS COME ONLINE THAT HAVE THAT ARE ZEROING BETTERS- AND SO. I THINK IT IS JUST LIKE WITH MANY THINGS WE'VE DONE LET'S MAKE THE INVESTMENT LET'S MAKE THE INVESTMENT NOW SO THAT WE'RE GOING TO ENSURE THAT THIS HAS A MUCH BETTER PLACE TO GO THAN THAN THE ALTERNATIVE WHICH I THINK WE ALL CAN AGREE IS NOT GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. IF I MAY IF I MAY FOLLOW UP THE GO AHEAD. SO MR GALLAGHER I- I DID PARTICIPATE IN THERE ARE SEVERAL TOURS OF THE NORTH STATE- BOTH IN YOUR DISTRICT AS WELL AS AND MISSED WAS- DISTRICT- AND I DID HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TOUR A BIOMASS FACILITY WITH- THE STRINGENT EMISSION CONTROL TECHNOLOGY THAT THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING ARM I AM JUST WONDERING GUY I HEARD IN TODAY'S GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE- MONIES TO EXPLORE- EXPANDING WHAT PRODUCT MARKETS I KNOW THAT- IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AS REFERENCED IN THE BILL ANALYSIS- IN THERE THERE WAS A- WORKING GROUP ESTABLISHED ON EXPANDING WOULD PRODUCT MARKETS AND THERE WAS ALSO A BILL- BY. OUR COLLEAGUE MS AGUIAR-CURRY AYE AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN- IT TOO TO FURTHER EXPLORE IT- THESE OTHER FORCE PRODUCTS WHY ARE THESE- WOOD PRODUCT MARKETS- YEAH EIGHT INADEQUATE. TO- YOU KNOW AVOID THE ALTERNATIVE THAT I AGREE IS NOT TO ENVIRONMENTALLY- FRIENDLY THEY THE OPEN PILE BURNING- IT'S PART OF IT I MEAN THAT'S DEFINITELY PART OF IT IS THAT MARKET- AND I THINK THAT'S HELPFUL I MEAN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ACTUALLY ALSO OUTLINES- I BELIEVE IT'S TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR TRANSPORTATION- SO THAT'S IN LINE WITH WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOUR TRANSPORTATION OF WOODY. BIOMASS FUELS- SO THIS WOULD BE IN LINE WITH NO I HAVEN'T SEEN THE DETAILS OF WHAT THAT IS YET DEFINITELY WANT TO. WORK ON THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT BUT I THINK WHAT I'M SAYING IS I THINK IT DOVETAILS AND REALLY NICELY WITH WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE. THERE IS THE MARKET PLACE- FOR OTHER WHAT WHAT PRODUCTS THEY CAN BE THEY CAN BE GENERATED FROM. THIS BOMB **** BUT THE PROBLEM IS JUST PAT THE REAL PROBLEM IS JUST CAPACITY TO TAKE OUT THIS AMOUNT TO DO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES A YEAR WHICH IS OUR GOAL. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF WOODY BIOMASS THAT YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO DO SOMETHING WITH NO PART OF IT IS THE MARKET FOR THOSE PRODUCTS BUT IT'S- BIOMASS IS GOT TO BE PART OF THAT PICTURE. TO OUR- MR MCCARTY. THANK YOU I'M NOT IN SHARE SO MR GALLAGHER I'M HAVING HAD A TOUGH TIME HERE AND I RESPECT WHAT YOU'RE COMING AFTER SAID THAT IF YOU QUESTIONS ON THIS BUT AS MR MARTUCCI SAID I'VE I'VE BEEN UP TO MISTER WOODS JUST CHECK IN MISTER DOLLARS AND SEEN THIS FIRST HAND YOU KNOW MY MEMORIES LOW SOUGHT AFTER MAKEOVER FLOP THIS PAST SUMMER'S I BLAME MY MEMORY ON CODE BUT THE TWO THINGS I REMEMBER FROM THAT STORE ARE. YOU KNOW THE TIMBER HARVEST PLANS WHICH YOU TALKED ABOUT A FEW MINUTES AGO MR FONG SPELL AND ALL THE WITH THE MATERIAL LEFT ON THAT THE FOREST FLOOR AND IT. SPLIT SPEARS- FUELS IN THOSE FIRES AND I KNOW YOU AND OTHERS MR WOULD HAVE TALKED. ABOUT THAT AMOUNT OF. I DAMAGE TO OUR- ENVIRONMENT IT'S ENOUGH OF THE MISSIONS- BY THESE FIRES IS JUST OUTRAGEOUS SO I GET THAT. I'M TRYING TO GRAPPLE WITH THERE IS I GUESS THIS BILL IS NOT QUITE WHAT MR PATTERSON WE TALK ABOUT A FEW YEARS AGO AND YOU'RE OFFERING A FEW THINGS HERE. BUT THE BIG PICTURE IS YOU KNOW YOU AND I SERVED ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE TOGETHER AND- OING IT. THERE'S ALWAYS PROPOSALS THAT COME FORWARD TO THE BUDGET AND THROUGH POLICY AND- YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE LUCKY WE CAME IN THE SAME YEAR IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THE BILLS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED. WHICH TRY TO LATCH ON. TO TEACH OUR F. MONIES. WOULD SPEND IT LIKE IN A FIFTEEN FOLD. AND SO THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THAT. BUT COMMITTEE WHICH IN SOME NUMBERS HERE. SERVED ON AND WE COME UP WITH THAT TDRS SPENDING PLAN AND. I JUST READ THE EVERYDAY THAT THE- REVENUES FROM THE AUCTION ARE. MUCH HIGHER THAN PROJECTED SO THEY'VE SHOULD BE OPPORTUNITY THAT- THERE WAS MONEY LAST YEAR'S BUDGET SO. WHY DO WE NEED. THIS BILL. IF IT'S REALLY A BUDGET ISSUE. AND YOU KNOW WE ARE SUCCESSFUL YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL LAST YEAR GETTING MONIES TO ADDRESS. BIOMASS YEAH NO THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION- WELL THE MONEY LAST YEAR WAS NOT FOR BIOMASS IT WAS FOR FUEL REDUCTION SURE RIGHT SO JUST GET IN THERE AND DOING DOING THE WORK BUT TO YOUR POINT THAT'S WHERE I THINK THIS THIS IS ACTUALLY HAS SYNERGY WITH THE BUDGET RIGHT BECAUSE GOVERNOR ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT HE IS ACTUALLY ALLOCATING MONIES TOWARDS TREND TOWARDS TRANSPORTATION COSTS FOR WHAT HE FEELS- SO- LET'S ARE THERE I'M I HAVEN'T SEEN EXACTLY WHAT HE IS SAYING IT WHERE THAT FUND WOULD COME FROM- BUT IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO COME FROM GIGI R. F. BECAUSE- NO ONE. WE'VE ALREADY MADE A COMMITMENT FROM GIGI R. F. FOR FUEL REDUCTION. RIGHT NOW WE'VE COMMITTED TO FIVE YEARS CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION FROM GIGI R. F. TO GO IN AND DO. A FEW MORE DUTCH ALREADY. THANK. THE NEW- SO WE'VE ALREADY TO SPENDING DID YOU OF MONE TO REMOVE THE FUEL THIS IS ABOUT HOW YOU GET IT TO A PLACE WHERE IT CAN BE DISPOSED OF IN THE MOST ENVIRONMENTALLY. BESSEMER EMILY FROM THE WAY WE HAVE AT THIS TIME AND AGAIN THE TECHNOLOGY IS GETTING BETTER SO- TO ME LIKE THIS. IF YOU JUST LEAVE IT OUT THERE. OR IF YOU LEAVE IT. PILED UP SOMEWHERE. THAT'S GOING TO BE A CARBON EMITTER OF MUCH GREATER PROPORTION THAN IF YOU. BURN THIS IN A BIOMASS FACILITY WHERE YOU HAVE AT LEAST. YOU KNOW SOME CONTROL OVER THAT AND CONTROL OVER EMISSIONS I GET THAT BUT- I KNOW LOOKING BACK TO PRIOR NOT TO RESOURCES SHARES. CRISTINA GARCIA MURATSUCHI INVESTMENT. IN MY YEARS HERE WE'VE HAD TONS OF G. DIRECT BILLS SO WE KIND OF TABLE THEM- BECAUSE YOU CAN'T THAT'S PRECLUDED THERE'S A BUDGET PROCESS OF. SHOULDN'T YOU AND- THEN OMEONE WERE TALI AND SUMMER WOULD FOCUS ON YOU KNOW BUDGET ASKED TO FOCUS ON HOW THE NORTH STATE HE COULD ADDRESS THIS IN. R. G. G. R. AFTER. SPENDING PLAN AS OPPOSED TO. PREDETERMINE AND CIRCUMVENT THAT BUDGET PROCESS HERE IN UP THROUGH THESE POLICY BILLS. YEAH WELL I'M NOT I'M NOT PREDETERMINED THIS IS THE POLICY PART RIGHT WE'RE SORRY IN THE POLICY IN PLACE. THAT DIRECTS THE- YOU KNOW DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES TO HAVE A GRANT PROGRAM. RIGHT THAT'S GONNA HAVE TO BE FUNDED. AND THAT'S THE BUDGETARY ISSUES SO. YEP I THINK WE DO THAT ALL OF FRONT RIGHT I MEAN- IN EDUCATION SET THE POLICY BUT THEN WE'RE ON THE EDUCATION SUB OR WE GO OKAY HOW DO WE FUND. THAT POLICY THAT WE'VE THAT WE'VE SET FOR LIKE FOR INSTANCE CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION- SO I THINK THERE IS SYNERGIES HERE BETWEEN BOTH OF THOSE. AND THAT'S WE WANT TO FIT TOGETHER- AND I WOULD NOTE THAT ACTUALLY NATURAL RESOURCES DID PASS OUT. A VERY SIMILAR BILL TO THIS I DON'T POINT OUT- JIM PATTERSON IS MY CO AUTHOR IT WAS HIS LEGISLATION- LAST- LAST TERM- THE PASTOR NATURI SOURCES WITH SOME SIMILAR AMENDMENTS THAT. WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING TODAY. THANK YOU. HOW MISTER MATHIS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST WANNA THANK YOU ARE CALLING MR GALLAGHER FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD IN ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE ON ON THE POLICY SIDE AND- YOU KNOW IT'S FASCINATING BECAUSE WE ALWAYS HEAR ABOUT THIS- WE DON'T WANT TO PAY TO HAVE DIESEL TRUCKS ALMOST OF DALIT THE FACT OF IT IS. DUE TO PROGRAMS THAT WE DID IN CAP AND TRADE WE ACTUALLY HAVE A- REAL BOSSED. RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS THAT'S COMING OFF OF DAIRIES NOW. AND THAT'S ACTUALLY FEELING THESE TRUCKS AND A LOT AREAS. SO YOU'RE YOU'RE ACTUALLY USING. SOME OF THESE MODELS THAT WE BUILT OUT AND OTHER SIDES OF GREENHOUSE GAS AND OF CAP AND TRADE ON WITH THESE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT CAN NOW ACTUALLY HOLD THIS STUFF SO TO SAY THAT IT'S- ONLY DIESEL FUELS. IS INCORRECT. WE HAVE OTHER. HEAVY EQUIPMENT TRUCKS THAT ARE RUNNING OFF OF RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS. SO THEY ANY GETS PAST TIME WE STOP USING THE ARGUMENT OF IT'S ONLY BEING HAULED BY DIESEL BECAUSE OF INCORRECT- THIS HAS TO GET DONE. EVERY YEAR YOU KNOW MY DISTRICT WE WERE HAVE IN FOREST FIRES AND IT WAS RAINING ASHES ON US BEFORE IT WAS SEXY AND HAPPEN TO OTHER PEOPLE IN OTHER AREAS. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS EVERY YEAR. CLICK INTEL WE ACTUALLY GO IN AND DO WITH THIS BILL INTENDS TO DO AND GET THIS WASTE OUT. OF OUR FOREST. IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAPPEN WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO HAVE AIR QUALITY SHOULD WE'RE GONNA THE THESE THINGS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAPPEN SO THEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE INCREASED COSTS ON THE HEALTHCARE- SIDE. AND EVERYWHERE ELSE. WE'VE SEEN IT. SO SIT HERE AND ARE YOU IS THIS THE RIGHT PLACE TO DO IT SHOULD BE A BUDGET ASK FOR SHOULD WE DO THIS WE DO THIS OF ALL TIME. ON THE WATERFRONT. I KNOW HOW MANY BILLS WE HAVE ALL PASSED IN THE LAST THREE YEARS. THEY DO GREAT PROGRAMS TO HELP WITH WATER QUALITY ISSUES. BUT THEN ON THE BUDGET SIDE WE TURN AROUND AND ALL MONIES ARE PUT INTO THE PROGRAMS. SO THAT PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT DON'T HAVE GOOD QUALITY WATER. BECAUSE IT DOESN'T FUND. THIS IS A POLICY BILL. THAT CLEANS UP THE AIR QUALITY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE PROVEN STUDIES FROM MULTIPLE LABS. THAT SHOW. THIS IS A BETTER WAY TO DISPOSE OF THE MATERIAL THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT HUMAN IT TOOK TO BURNING RAIN ASHES ON YOUR CONSTITUENTS PRETTY WANNA DISPOSE OF IT IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE. I MOVE THAT WE DISPOSE OF IT IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE MISTER GALLERY THANK YOU FOR YOUR BILL. MISTER WHAT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND JUST A JUST A FEW COMMENTS- I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW HOW CLOSE. WHAT THE AUTHOR IS OFFERING GETS YOU TO WHERE THE PREVIOUS BILL WAS- COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I DON'T MY MEMORY ISN'T THAT GOOD. SO WHAT THAT'LL LOOK LIKE BUT BUT I THINK IS A KEY THING THERE THAT THAT'S MEANT WAS MENTIONED AND THAT HE'S HE'S ASKING FOR THIS TO NOT BE ALLOWED IN IN NON ATTAINMENT AREAS SO- I THINK THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT LOOK I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS. RESISTANCE TO BIOMASS IN SOME AREAS BECAUSE OF HOW IT'S DONE- BUT I LIVE IN ONE OF THOSE AREAS THAT IS AN ATTAINMENT AND- YOU KNOW WE'VE BERMAN WE'VE LOST A COUPLE MILLION ACRES IN THE LAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS- WENT WHEN THOSE FIRES HAPPEN. THE FIRES HAPPENED- ALL THE FOLKS TO THE SOUTH OF US AND IN SACRAMENTO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE AIR QUALITY- THE THAT THEY GET THE BRIEF- I WISH THEY MIGHT COME AND VISIT US DURING SOME OF THESE FIRES AND EXPERIENCE. WHAT IT'S LIKE ON THE GROUND TO BITS OF DEBRIS THAT AIR QUALITY- AND- AND RECOGNIZE THAT. IF WE CONTINUE DOWN THE PATH WE'RE GOING. ON THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAPPEN YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR. SO HERE WE ARE MAKING CONCERTED EFFORTS TO DO VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. BUT HAVE NO WHERE TO TAKE THE VEGETATE THE MET THE VEGETATION IS BEEN MANAGE- AND THAT IS THAT IS PROBLEMATIC- WOULD NEED TO HAUL THIS AS FAR IF WE HAD MORE. WE COULD REACTIVATE SOME OF THE EXISTING BY MAP BIOMASS PLANTS THAT HAVE. BEEN CLOSED OVER THE YEARS. THAT'S A WHOLE NOTHER ISSUE. WHEN YOU DO SOME OF THIS VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WHAT'S ALSO NOT BEING CONSIDERED HERE IS THAT- IT ALLOWS THE FORCE TO BECOME HEALTHIER. WHICH ALLOWS THE TREES TO BECOME BIGGER. WHICH ALLOWS US TO SEQUESTER MORE CARBON. THERE IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT TO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE LEAVING THE FUELS ON THE FOREST FLOOR. LEADS TO METHANE RELEASE OVER TIME ALSO IS ANOTHER POTENTIAL FUEL SOURCE FOR ADDITIONAL FIRES IN THE FUTURE. IT ISN'T AN EFFICIENT WAY TO PRODUCE ENERGY. IT WON'T BE AN EFFICIENT WAY TO PRODUCE ENERGY. AND WE SHOULDN'T BE LOOKING AT IT THAT WAY I THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AND BE LOOKING AT THIS AS A LARGER SOCIETAL BENEFIT. IS IT DO WE REALLY WANT OUR CHILDREN. AND R. AND A AND OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE FRAIL TO CONTINUE TO HAVE TO BRIEF- PARTICULAR MATTER PM TWENTY TWO POINT FIVE WHICH IS REALLY REALLY UNHEALTHY. DO WE REALLY WANT THAT. OR DO WE WANT TO LOOK AT SOME OTHER THINGS RECOGNIZING THAT THAT THERE ARE COMPROMISES THAT THERE ARE. THERE THERE IS THERE IS THERE IS NO PERFECT SOLUTION WE DON'T HAVE THAT PERFECT SOLUTION YET. AND SO- I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY- I BELIEVE- IT'S IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE DISTRICT I REPRESENT THE PEOPLE THAT I REPRESENT. AND- I HOPE THAT TO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PROCEDURE LEAVE IF HE'S NOT WHAT HE'S OFFERING WORKS FOR YOU AS A CHAIR- BUT- I'M NOT TO SHARE THIS WITH SO ANYWAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR WET AND- YOU KNOW THANK YOU MISTER GALLAGHER FOR PRESENTING THIS BILL- YOU KNOW I. WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY- MAINLY BECAUSE- I BELIEVE THAT DID YOU ARE A FUNDS SHOULD BE USED TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND WHAT THIS BILL IS PROPOSING. IS TO SUBSIDIZE THE TRUCKING OF THIS MATERIAL PUT PERHAPS LONG DISTANCES- AND YOU KNOW I FEEL LIKE IT'S MOVING IN THAT PROBLEM SOMEWHERE ELSE. RIGHT THEY ARE QUALITY ISSUES- I THINK THIS COULD BE MORE. PROPERLY A BUDGET REQUEST OF LIKE- I THINK SOMEONE ELSE MENTIONED ARE AND- YOU KNOW I AGREE WITH YOU THERE IS A CHALLENGE WITH. BIOMASS TREATMENT AND UTILIZATION- BUT- I DON'T FEEL LIKE THIS IS THE SOLUTION AND IF IT'S NOT ONE THAT I CAN SUPPORT AND I KNOW PEOPLE HAVE MENTIONED THAT. THIS BILL WAS PRESENTED AN AMENDED IN THE PAST I WASN'T THE CHAIR AT THE TIME AND I DIDN'T SERVE ON THE COMMITTEE. ARE AND SO I MADE THIS DECISION- TO NOT SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY- AND- YOU I HOPE THAT I KNOW YOU WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS SITE A- YOU'LL COMMEND YOU FOR YOUR PASSION. FOR SERVING THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE SUFFERED MOST FROM WILDFIRES IN OUR STATE- BUT I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING TODAY. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE- YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRMAN- CHAIRWOMAN AND- WHAT I WOULD PROPOSE TO THE COMMITTEE IS- I WILL TAKE. IF YOU WOULD MOVING TODAY I WOULD ASK THAT IT BE MOVED AS AMENDED- AND SO I'D ASK FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE COMMITTEE- I WILL ABSOLUTELY TAKE THE AMENDMENT THAT SAYS- THESE THESE CANNOT BE APPLIED TO BIOMASS PLANTS THAT ARE IN NON ATTAINMENT AREAS- AND I DISAGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE. MISTER WOULD YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE WILL TAKE THESE PLACES CUTS AND WE WILL TAKE THEM BELIEVE ME BECAUSE WE HAVE. WE HAVE A TEAM IN OUR AREAS AND WE NEED THESE DESPERATELY TO REMOVE THE FEELS- AND TO MAKE OUR COMMUNITY SAFER AND FOR THE JOBS QUITE FRANKLY- SO I WOULD ABSOLUTELY TAKE THAT. THAT AMENDMENT I THINK THAT ADDRESSES WE'RE NOT ADDING. NEW POLLUTANTS INTO AN AREA THAT'S ALREADY IN NON ATTAINMENT- I WOULD ALSO TAKE THE AMENDMENT WOULD ASK IS A I HAVE AN AMENDMENT THAT TO. AND THAT SAYS IT. THIS CAN APPLY TO THOSE THAT ARE ALREADY GETTING THE NINE OH ONE- MONEY- UNTIL THERE UNTIL THAT CONTRACT IS EXPIRED IN WHICH CASE AND THEY COULD APPLY AT THAT POINT. SO THOSE AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD REALLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT MOVE FOR AND ON THE ON THE TRUCKING SAID JUST ASK YOU TO CONSIDER I MEAN. YOU KNOW WHEN WE BRING IN SOLAR PANELS. TO BE PUT IN AND INSTALLED AND FACILITIES AND- ON HOMES THEY'RE TRUCKED IN HERE WOULD DIESEL TRUCKS. OKAY WE BRING IN THE BIG WINDMILL COMPONENTS TO DO WIND ENERGY. THEY'RE TRUCKED IN BY DIESEL TRUCKS. NOW I CAN'T CHANGE THE FACT OF WHAT IS MOVING IN ALL KINDS OF GOODS. IN CALIFORNIA BUT WHAT I CAN DO IN THIS IS I THINK THE- IT'S A BIT OF A RED HERRING BECAUSE IT'S NOT ABOUT THE TRUCKING IT'S ACTUALLY ABOUT THE BIOMASS FACILITY ITSELF WHICH IS WHERE THAT. WOODY BIOMASS IS DISPOSED OF IN THE MOST ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE WAY AND WE GOT IT WE HAVE TO INVEST IN THAT TECHNOLOGY WE NEED TO MAKE IT EVEN BIGGER LIKE WE HAVE DONE. IN OTHER ASK AVENUES AND THIS WOULD DO THAT. THIS WOULD BE THAT INCENTIVE THAT WOULD BUILD MORE THESE BIOMASS PLANTS BECAUSE THEN THE COST. IT WORKS OUT. THEN IF YOU HAVE SOMEBODY HELPING SUBSIDIZE THE COST OF THE TRANSPORTATION WHICH IS THERE. THEIR BIGGEST HARD COST- SO I REALLY ASK YOU DID FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION- WITH THOSE AMENDMENT TO THIS BILL ASK YOU TO VOTE YES TO MOVE THIS. MOVE THIS FORWARD. ARE YOU KNOW I. THAT THAT'S YOU DID MENTION SOME AMENDMENTS THAT OF THOSE AREN'T AMENDMENTS THAT I PROPOSED RIGHT OF AND- YOU KNOW YOU. IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE SPELL IT YOU KNOW YOU'RE WELCOME TO INTRODUCE A NEW BILL. AS YOU KNOW AS YOU KNOW THIS IS THE TO YOUR BILLS I HAVE NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO EVALUATE. OF THE BILL IN WHATEVER WAY YOU WANT TO AMENDMENT- SO I WILL. CONTINUE TO NOT. THE BILL IN THIS FORM TODAY. R. N. AND I KNOW THAT ONE OFFICIAL COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS- THEY WERE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE IN THE PREVIOUS LEGISLATION THAT CAME TO THE COMMITTEE NO I UNDERSTAND SO I KNOW AND THAT COMMITTEE STAFF. AND MY STAFF HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT THESE AMENDMENTS SO. IT'S ALL VERY CLEAR IN WRITING SO IF THE COMMITTEE WANTED TO- YOU KNOW. DOZEN MEMBERS COULD EASILY BE MADE AS PART OF A MOTION TO AMEND THE BILL AND MOVE IT OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY AND THAT'S WHAT I WOULD ASK IF THE COMMITTEE IS AMENABLE TO THAT. I AM NOT TODAY R. N. AND SO WE WILL BE VOTING ON THE BILL AS IS IN PRINT. TODAY I'M SO I HAVE A MOTION OF THE TO MOVE THE BILL BY MISTER MATHIS SECOND- BY MISTER FLORA THE MOTION IS TO PASS.

THE FACT YEAH- PLEASE MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE AND PHILLIES PLEASE START WHEN YOU'RE READY HI I'M YEAH I'M READY- THIS IS A- EIGHT EIGHT ELEVEN FIFTY FOUR- FOR. CREATING A SEQUEL EXEMPTION FOR EGRESS ROUTE- PROJECTS FOR FIRE SAFETY FOR THE SAFETY OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE- HIGH FIRE AREAS TO HAVE- A STREAMLINED WAY OF GETTING THESE EGRESS AND- ROADS ARE TAUGHT TO SAY THANK YOU FIRST OF ALL FOR. THE HARD WORK THE COMMITTEES DONE- BLOOD TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN AUTHORED AB TWO NINE ONE ONE REQUIRING THE BOARD OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION. TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT IMPROVE THE FIRE SAFETY OF EXISTING SUBDIVISIONS THAT DON'T HAVE A SECONDARY EXIT RIGHT LESS THAN. TWO MONTHS AFTER AB TWENTY NINE ELEVEN WAS SIGNED INTO LAW THE CAMPFIRE REP DID. TORE THROUGH THE CITY OF PARADISE IT KILLED EIGHTY SIX PEOPLE DESTROYING NEARLY. FOURTEEN THOUSAND HOMES SO. BECAME OBVIOUS THAT THE CAPACITY PROBLEMS NOTWITHSTANDING OF PARADISE AT FOUR ROUTES TO GET RESIDENTS OUT OF TOWN IN THE EVENT OF EMERGENCY. THAT WHILE MANY OTHER COMMUNITIES HAVE ONLY ONE. HAD THIS BEEN THE CASE IN PARADISE WE COULD EXPECT THE DEATH TOLL MUCH MUCH HIGHER. SO THE BILL BEFORE YOU PROVIDES A SEQUEL EXEMPTION FOR PROJECTS RECOMMENDED. BY THE BOARD OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION THAT IMPROVE THE FIRE SAFETY OF EXISTING SUBDIVISIONS THAT ARE LOCATED IN HIGH OR VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD ZONES. AND WHO DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH EXIT ROUTES TO GET RESIDENTS OUT SAFELY. A PREVIOUS VERSION OF THIS BILL WAS PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE. BUT WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR HOWEVER THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT NOW MORE THAN EVER IN LIGHT OF THE INCREASING NUMBER AND THE SEVERITY OF THE FIRES THAT SWEEP ACROSS THE STATE EACH YEAR. I KNOW THE CREEK FIRE THE DIXIE FIRE THE CAL FIVE OUT OF FIVE JUST TO NAME A FEW THE BOARDHAS NOW RELEASED. SUBDIVISION REVIEWS MAKING IT THE PERFECT TIME TO IMPLEMENT THIS POLICY TO PROTECT THESE COMMUNITIES BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE. AB ELEVEN FIFTY FOUR IS NEEDED SO THAT THESE PROJECTS THOSE THAT ARE IN HIGH AND VERY HIGH SECURITY A SEVERITY ZONES. CAN BE COMPLETED WITH THE URGENCY IDENTIFIED BY THE BOARD FORCED FOUR STRAIGHT. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT I BELIEVE IT'S JOHN KENNEDY ON THE PHONE. WITH A RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA AND THE BUTTE COUNTY SUPERVISOR JOHN. TEETER WHO REPRESENTS PARADISE. THANK YOU. OPERATE WE ARE READY FOR WITNESSES SUPPORT WILL START WITH JOHN KENNEDY. GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN JOHN KENNEDY WITH RC RC AND WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO SPONSOR AB ELEVEN FIFTY FOUR TODAY I'D REITERATE WE REALLY APPRECIATE WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS AND COMMITTEE STAFF TO IMPROVE AND REFINE THIS BILL HAS THE AUTHOR SAID THIS BILL SEEKS TO CREATE A NARROW SICKLE EXEMPTION AND A LIMITED NUMBER OF CIRCUMSTANCES FOR THE CREATION OF SECONDARY INGRESS ROUTES. WHERE SUBDIVISIONS ARE AT HIGH FIRE RISK AND DON'T HAVE A SECONDARY EGRESS ROUTE FOR THE RESIDENTS TO GET OUT SAFELY IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY. I THINK MAYBE MY OFFICE NOTES MANY OF THESE SUBDIVISIONS WERE BUILT LONG AGO AND ONLY HAVE A SINGLE ROUTE FOR ENTERING AND LEAVING THIS BILL WILL ADDRESS THE RISK OF ROAD CLOSURE DURING AN EMERGENCY AND CONGESTION DURING AN EMERGENCY BY EXPEDITING CREATION OF SECONDARY ROUTES IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. AS HAS BEEN STATED REASON WILDFIRES OF TAKING A TREMENDOUS TOLL ON RESOURCES COMMUNITIES IN LIVES LOST- WITH FOUR POINT TWO MILLION AND TWO POINT FIVE MILLION ACRES OF CALIFORNIA BURNED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY ONE WILDFIRES RESPECTIVELY AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS DISPLACED BY THOSE FIRES. THE DEADLY CAMPFIRE WHICH YOU'LL HEAR MORE LATER- WAS THE DEADLIEST WILDFIRE IN STATE HISTORY AND DEMONSTRATED THE PRESSING NEED PROGRESS ROUTES WHILE AB THREE NINETY FOUR WAS VETOED IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE AGREED THAT THESE CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED THE BOARD OF FORESTRY HAVE NOT YET IDENTIFIED NOR MADE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS OR COMMUNITY AT THE TIME OF THREE NINETY FORESEE TELL. BUT THE BOARD HAS DONE SO NOW AND THEY'VE ADOPTED RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PERHAPS A THIRD OF THOSE SO FAR WITH MORE ON THE WAY. TO SPONSOR ELEVEN NINE FIFTY FOUR BECAUSE IT WILL HELP LOCAL GOVERNMENTS GET THE SECONDARY EGRESS ROUTE PROJECTS BUILT FASTER AND REDUCE COSTS VOIDING THE POTENTIAL CRITICAL LITIGATION THAT COULD INCREASE PROJECT COSTS AND DELAY COMPLETION. THIS IS BECAUSE THE BAR FOR FILING CLAIMS IS SO VERY WELL WHEN IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH FOR PROJECT UPON. TO DELAY A PROJECT. ALL COURT CONSIDERS THE COR. THESE ARE THE WAY. THE MANY WERE COMMUNITY CANNOT. AND SO WE ARE HERE I TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK NEXT WERE READY FOR SUPERVISOR TEETER. I THINK YOU- OBVIOUSLY- AND VERY STRONG SUPPORTOF THE IN THE BUTTE COUNTY SUPERVISOR THAT POTS TO SOME OF THE CAMPFIRE IF YOU DON'T MIND DAHLE SHARE MY PERSONAL STORY- THE DAY OF THE CAMPFIRE I EVACUATED FROM MY HOUSE I NEEDED A QUARTER MILE AWAY I HAD TO SHELTER IN PLACE. A WOMAN PERISHED IN A VEHICLE NOT FAR FROM LONDON SHELTERED IN PLACE- ALSO AGAIN MAKE YOU RECALL A JEWISH NAME FOR PEOPLE PERISHED IN I DON'T. NEED A LECTURE THAT THIS HORRIFIC STORY BUT IT'S JUST IT'S. SUCH A STRONG- FEELING ME. TO HAVE THAT PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND I HAD TO REMOVE EXIT ROUTES. AVAILABLE FROM MY HOUSE ONE ONE THE LEGEND OF THE FIRE ONE I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE GOT TO SAFETY QUICKLY IF I WILL BE USED TO IT- BUT I TOLD MY WIFE TO GO PICK UP MY CHILDREN. AT SCHOOL IN THE CENTER OF TOWN. AND IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM TO BE JUST A UNIQUE SITUATION- WE SAW WHAT HAPPENED IN THE DIXIE FIRING PRETTY BILL AND ALSO RECENTLY WITH COLORADO.

AGAIN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- MEMBERS APPRECIATE THE- WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE AND ANNA AND APPRECIATE- YOUR RECOGNITION OF THE BILL'S IMPORTANCE AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR THAT AND THANK YOU IN TWENTY NINETEEN AB ONE SEVENTY EIGHT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW THIS BILL PROVIDED AN EXEMPTION TO THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION RULING THAT REQUIRED ALL NEWLY CONSTRUCTED HOMES IN THE STATE THAT SOLAR PANELS. BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY THE EXEMPTION WAS ONLY FOR VICTIMS WHOSE HOMES WERE DESTROYED IN A NATURAL DISASTER THAT OCCURRED DURING A GOVERNOR DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY ADDITIONALLY FOR THE EXEMPTION TO APPLY INCOME SQUARE FOOTAGE CAN OR INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS DID HAVE TO BE MET. THIS IS A NARROW EXEMPTION TO THE CVC REQUIREMENT FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION IS GEARED TOWARDS A LOWER INCOME CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE BEING FORCED TO REBUILD THEIR HOME THAT WAS DESTROYED THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN AB TEN SEVENTY EIGHT WOULD SIMPLY EXTEND THE PROVISIONS OF AB ONE SEVENTY EIGHT. TO NAURAL DISASTERS THAT OCCURRED IN TWENTY TWENTY TO ENSURE THAT THE VICTIMS THAT WERE. LOOKED AFTER AND HELPED IN TWENTY NINETEEN. ARE ALSO NOW HELPED AND PROVIDED UP. WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO REBUILD WITHOUT THAT THE EXTREME COST OF THE OF THE SOLAR PANELS FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY- DISASTERS TWENTY TWENTY WAS A YEAR WHEN MANY LOST NOT ONLY THEIR HOMES BUT- CRAPS LOVED ONES AS WELL AND LIVELIHOODS DUE TO COVER NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY WILDFIRES. INCLUDE SOME OF THE LARGEST THEY INCLUDED THE AUGUST COMPLEX THE S. C. U. LIGHTNING COMPLEX THE L. N. U. LIGHTNING COMPLEX. THE GLASS ZAUGG AND THE CREEK FIRE. AND SO I THINK. WITH RESPECT RESPECTIVELY. SOME OF THE OPPOSITION- I THINK THAT THESE ARE VICTIMS AND THAT THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE FORCED TO INSTALL. SOLAR PANELS SINCE THEY ARE BUILDING NEW CONSTRUCTION. IT IS BASICALLY LOOKING PAST THEIR THEIR BAD FORTUNE AND- NOT WRECKED RECOGNIZING THAT IT IS A SIGNIFICANT COST. TO MANY UP IN THESE AREAS. IF THEIR HOMES WERE STILL STANDING THEY WOULD NOT BE FACING THIS KIND OF A DECISION. THEY WOULD NOT HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN UPGRADING. OR LEAVING THE COMMUNITY OUT OR THE AREA. THESE ARE NOT INVESTORS OR REAL ESTATE MOGULS. THESE ARE VICTIMS WHO ARE TRYING TO COME BACK HOME. THEY'RE BUILDING A NEW CONSTRUCTION HOME NOT BY CHOICE BUT BY NECESSITY. GIVEN THE RISING COST OF THESE REBUILT THE CHANGES TO NET ENERGY METERING THE FACT THAT MANY OF THESE VICTIMS ALREADY DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH INSURANCE. TO COVER THE COST OF REBUILDING AS IT IS AB TEN SEVENTY EIGHT IS AN APPROPRIATE AND A LIMITED MEASURE. TO HELP YOU TO THE BURDEN OF REBUILDING ONE'S LIFE AFTER ALL OF WHICH TO STRIVE. BY THE WILDFIRE. AND I DO THINK THAT THERE IS ALSO. A REAL ISSUE OF- FAIRNESS HERE AS WELL. TWENTY NINETEEN HAD VICTIMS AND HAD. BOB THIS EXEMPTION TWENTY TWENTY LOTS OF VICTIMS. IT SHOULD HAVE THIS EXEMPTION AS WELL. AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT I BELIEVE WE HAVE AREA RAIL- PREVIOUS CHAIRED THE CREEK FIRE RECOVERY COLLABORATIVE. I THINK A JOHN KENNEDY AS WELL WITH A RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES. K. TESTIFIED SUPPORT THANK YOU- WE ARE READY FOR WITNESSES. UP TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT. OPERATOR Q. PLEASE OPEN UP THE LINE IT WAS I MISSED THE FIRST NAME I DON'T HAVE THEM LISTED- ARI ARROYO ARI A ROYAL IS HE AVAILABLE THE CHAIR OF THE CREEK FIRE RECOVERY NOT COLLABORATIVE- FIRST HAND ON THE GROUND EXPERIENCE WITH THESE HOME OWNERS TRYING TO REBUILD IN FACING THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIGH COST. OPERATOR WE ARE READY I'M HERE A PLEASE GO AHEAD HI MY NAME IS ARE YOU LOYAL AND I SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL TEN SEVENTY EIGHT. I LIVE IN PHILLY CALIFORNIA.

I WOULD HEAR THROUGHOUT THE FIRE FIGHTING THE FIRE AND I KNOW THE RESIDENTS AND THIS IS HOME. I AM HERE MOST IMPORTANTLY IS A FULL TIME RESIDENT AND ONE OF THE FEW WHO DID NOT LOSE THEIR HOME IN THE CREEK FIRE. BECAUSE I WAS SO LUCKY TO HAVE BEEN MY GOAL TO DO EVERYTHING AND ANYTHING I CAN TO AID THOSE WHO LOST EVERYTHING IN THE FIRE. AB TEN SEVENTY EIGHT IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO AID IN THE RECOVERY AND REBUILDING OF OUR MOUNTAIN COMMUNITIES. THE FINANCIAL BURDEN TO THOSE WHO LOST THEIR HOMES AND EVERYTHING THEY OWNED DUE TO THE CREEK FIRE. AS WELL AS THE OTHER CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES IT'S ASTRONOMICAL AND THE ADDED REQUIREMENTS SOLAR PANELS IS A HUGE BURDEN WHICH CAN IN SOME INSTANCES. MEDICALLY BUILDING UNVIABLE. IN MY COMMUNITY ALONE WE LOST 75% OF OUR HOME. AND ALMOST ALL OF THOSE HOMEOWNERS WITH TOLD ME THAT THEY WANT TO BE BUILT. THEY HAVE HOWEVER ALSO STATED THAT DUE TO THE TOUGH ECONOMY WE ARE IN. AND THE HIGH COST OF BUILDING INCLUDING ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS SOLAR PANELS BUT UNABLE TO DO SO AT THIS TIME. I CANNOT FULLY EXPRESS HOW IT BREAKS YOUR HEART. TO HAVE YOUR NEIGHBOR TELL YOU. SORRY WITH. ARE IS. BUT THEIR GREATEST WEAKNESS COME BACK HOME. BUT WE CAN AFFORD TO. WITHOUT AB TWO SEVEN EIGHT NOT ONLY WILL MANY NOT BE ABLE TO REBUILD. MAYBE FORCED TO LEAVE THEIR COMMUNITY IMPOSSIBLE EVEN COMPLETED THE STATE. YEAH COUNTLESS FINANCIAL COULDN'T HURDLES TO CROSS AND IF WE CAN ALLEVIATE AT LEAST ONE OF THOSE HRDLES BY PASSING AB TEN SEVENTY EIGHT THE IMPACT WILL BE HUGE. SORRY ON BEHALF OF ALL THOSE WHO LOST THEIR HOMES ONE OF THE CALIFORNIA WIRE BOTTOM FIRED WE ASK THAT YOU VOTE IN FAVOR OF A. B. TEN SEVENTY EIGHT TO SPEAK HERE. THANK YOU NEXT AND WE'RE READY FOR JOHN KENNEDY.

AND MANY OF THESE FIRES SYSTEMS THAT WERE IN SOCIO ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED AREAS THE VICTIMS ARE INCREASINGLY FINDING THEMSELVES UNDER INSURED OR UNABLE TO ACQUIRE INSURANCE AND ALSO FACE MANY OTHER WHEN HE DELAYS ASSOCIATED WITH BUILDING THEIR HOMES WE APPRECIATE THAT ABC TEN SEVENTY EIGHT AS A LIMITED ONE YEAR EXT EXTENSION OF THE DAILY EXEMPTION- FOUR HOMES DESTROYED BEFORE TWENTY TWENTY. IT PROVIDES VERY MUCH NEEDED RELIEF FOR THOSE RESIDENTS WHOSE HOMES WERE DAMAGED OR DESTROYED AND TWENTY TWENTY WHILE IT IS ADMITTEDLY LESS EXPENSIVE TO INSTALL SOLAR PANELS ON A NEWLY CONSTRUCTED HOME IT CAN STILL BE VERY EXPENSIVE AND THOSE ARE UP FRONT COSTS FOR REBUILDING A HOME. WHILE THE PAY BACK PERIOD MAY BE OVER TEN FIFTEEN TWENTY YEARS OR OR LONGER DEPENDING ON THE INSTALLATION ITS UP FRONT COST AND THOSE HURT- AND THAT MAKES REBUILDING HARDER AND MORE EXPENSIVE AS MR PATTERSON SAID FOR THOSE WHO'VE ALREADY LOST EVERYTHING AND THEY MAY NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO REBUILD THEIR LIVES. FURTHERMORE AS NOTED THE PSC IS POISED TO REVISE THE SOLAR NET ENERGY METERING TARIFF- AND IN A WAY IT IF AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN AND COMPOSED IN A WAY THAT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE O TWITTER WORKABLE COSTS FOR ALL HOMEOWNERS WITH SOLAR THIS COULD HAVE AN EVEN MORE AGGRESSIVE IMPACT IN SOME OF THESE VERY DEVASTATED COMMUNITIES SO FOR THESE AND OTHER REASONS WE AREN'T YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB. SEVENTY EIGHT AND APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION. TO THAT. THANK YOU. I'M NEXT ARE WE WILL HEAR FROM THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION- WE HAVE DANIEL BROAD FROM THE SIERRA CLUB OF CALIFORNIA.

WE DEEPLY SYMPATHIZE WITH THE VICTIMS OF WILDFIRES AND OTHER DISASTERS AND RECOGNIZE THE FINANCIAL BURDEN OF REBUILDING WE ALSO STRONGLY SUPPORT APPROPRIATE MEASURES TO HELP COMMUNITIES RECOVER. HOWEVER EXEMPTING BUILDING CODE REQUIREMENTS THAT WILL REDUCE ENERGY YEARS MAY COME TOMORROW AT THE END AND LOWER ELECTRICITY BALLOTS IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION ONLY A TRIP CAL IMPROVEMENTS THAT WILL ENSURE. THAT ENERGY EFFICIENCY MEASURES REQUIRED UNDER NEW BUILDING CODES DAVE MARTIN YOU'RE TELLING ME ABOUT THE NET COST. THAT RESULTS IN HOMEOWNER SAVING ENERGY FROM THE DAY THEY MOVED AND THROUGHOUT THE LIFETIME OF THE HOUSE. ADDITIONALLY WILDFIRE BRETT'S KIDS FORCED FREQUENT PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF IN RECENT YEARS. AT THE CLIMATE CRISIS WORSENS. THESE EVENTS WILL UNFORTUNATELY BECOME EVEN MORE COMMON EVEN THOUSANDS OF POUNDS WITHOUT POWER- I'M THE WITHOUT A PENALTY BY NOT RELYING ON THE GRAD AND CAN POWER AND KEEP KEEP THE POWER ON EVEN DURING THE- AS COMMUNITY THREE FAILED.

WE BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT THE STATE HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO WALK THE TALK WHEN SETTING AND IT. THAT IS WHY WE SUPPORTED THE BY THING CALIFORNIA ACT SIGNED INTO LAW IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHICH CREATED A PROCESS FOR THE STATE TO PROCURE SUSTAINABLE. AND LOW CARBON CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS. UNFORTUNATELY INTERIOR MATERIALS SUCH AS CARPET GYPSUM BOARD INFLATION FEELING HELPLESS ADDRESS. OR NOT ADDRESS AND CAN HAVE. A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON CRIME THAT FIX THE COMMISSION AND REQUIRE CALIFORNIA TO VOTE WITH THEIR DOLLARS BY DANCING BY CLEAN APPROACH FOR INTERIOR CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL.

WHAT THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS. BILL HAS SEVEN BUT LEAVE IT OPEN. AND JUST ONE MOMENT. LOOKING FOR AN AUTHOR. CHRISTINE MISTER SEA. OF THEIR AVAILABLE. SO WE WERE GARCIA PRESENTING A. B. TEN OH ONE. THANK YOU- ALSO OUT OF PRACTICE OH ONE IS ABOUT PROTECTING FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES FROM NEGATIVE AIR AND WATER AND PACKS I LIVE IN ONE OF THOSE COMMUNITIES IN THE CITY OF ALL OF OUR AND THAT'S WHERE I GREW UP WHERE I LIVE NOW. AND I TALK ABOUT THAT PERSONAL EXPERIENCE ALL THE TIME- I'M SURE YOU. YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH OF IT SOMETIMES. BUT THE REALITY IS THAT WHAT WE'VE DONE SOME PROGRESS HERE IN THE STATE THERE'S MORE WORK TO BE DONE. OUT THERE. ARE THESE COMMUNITIES ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY CANCER DIABETES ASTHMA OFTENTIMES CALLED THINGS LIKE CANCER ALLEY. AND THEY'VE BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC AS WELL. THIS BILL SIX INSURE THAT MITIGATION FOR PROJECT HAPPENS DIRECTLY IN THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY AND NOT SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE STATE OR THE WORLD. THE BILL ALSO SEEKS TO ENSURE THAT AGENCIES IMPLEMENTING PEOPLE ARE FALLING PRINCIPLES. OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. I RECOGNIZE THAT MUCH OF THE SEQUEL MITIGATION HAPPENS WITHIN THE AFFECT THE COMMUNITY BUT THAT IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE. SOME EXAMPLES INCLUDE TO GHG REDUCTION PROJECTS THAT COULD BE IN ANOTHER PART OF THE WORLD. ARE POLLUTION MITIGATION THAT MAY HAPPEN ELSEWHERE IN THE REGION. MY CONCERN IS FOR THOSE WHO ARE NEIGHBORS. WHAT ABOUT THEIR HEALTH I OFTENTIMES COMMITTEES LIKE MINOR TREE LIKE WHERE SACRIFICE SO THERE IS STILL DOUBLE FOR THE PROGRESS OF OTHERS AND SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF WE CAN THAT WE DO ALL WE CAN TO MITIGATE WITHIN THOSE COMMUNITIES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE ANY REGISTER SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL. SO WE WILL GO TO OPPOSITION ON THE PHONE LINES. THAT I HAVE. I DON'T HAVE ANY ON THE LIST- FULLER YES. MISTER ROBERT PLEASE OPEN THE LINE FOR SUPPORT. CHRIS JARVIS ON AB TEN OH ONE. YES GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MEMBER TODD MY NAME IS CHRIS SHOPPERS THAT I AM THE DEPUTY POLICY DIRECTOR COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR I'VE ALSO A WEST LONG BEACH RESIDENT AND MEMBER OF THE WILMINGTON CARSON IN WEST PALM BEACH EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN COMMUNITY STEERING COMMITTEE. CULTURE FOR CLEANER STRONGLY SUPPORT AB ONE THOUSAND ONE THIS BILL BENTON COMPARTMENTAL JUSTICE BY ENSURING SPEAK WITH MITIGATION REGIMENT HAVE A DIRECT BENEFIT TO THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THIS BILL WOULD ALSO MAKE SURE THAT SHE COULD LEAD AGENCIES HAVE ACT CONSISTENTLY OF COMPARTMENTAL JUSTICE PRINCIPLES. HOW CLIMATE NOT PROTECTED COMMUNITY COLLEGE. MANY COMEDIANS PARTICULARLY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES CONTINUE TO SUFFER A DESPERATE IMPACT. FOR EXAMPLE THE WESTERN PART OF LONG BEACH WHERE I LIVE AT HIGHER RATES OF ASTHMA A HIGHER RISK OF CANCER AND ULTIMATELY A SHORTER LIFE EXPECTANCY THAN THE EASTERN PART OF THE- THIS ISN'T SURPRISING GIVEN THAT TWO OF THE WORLD'S MOST SIGNIFICANT SEAPORTS ARE ALSO IN NEARBY. ALONG WITH LOCAL RAIL YARDS AND FREEWAYS THE BULK OF CALIFORNIA OIL REFINING CAPACITY AND THOUSANDS OF ACTIVE AND INACTIVE OIL DRILLING SITES. BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THESE POLLUTION SOURCES ARE HERE BECAUSE OF CHOICES BOTH BY THE INDUSTRY TO END UP WITH A FOCUS PROJECTS. ALONG WITH HE AGENCIES APPROVAL. A DIFFICULT CHOICE BEN PUTTING POLLUTION SORTS OF AN OVERBURDENED COMMUNITIES REMAINS A CHOICE THAT. WE HAVE THE TOOLS TO HELP POLICYMAKERS MAKE INFORMED CHOICES. FECAL AND OTHER LAWS NOT ONLY REQUIRE AGENCIES TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACTS OF APPROVING A NEW PROJECT BUT CAN ALSO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE POLLUTION THE FIRST PLACE. IDEALLY THIS SHOULD MEAN THAT ANY HARM TO THE COMMUNITY THAT THEY MIGHT EXPERIENCE DUE TO A PROJECT CAN BE DISSIPATED AND MITIGATE. YES TO THE PURCHASING OF CREDITS AND OTHER COMPLIANCE PATHWAYS THAT MEDICATION MEASUREMENTS CAN BE IMPLEMENTED OUTSIDE THE COMMUNITY WHERE THE PROJECT IS LOCATED. WITH ITS FINANCIALLY EXPORTS THE BENEFITS OF A PROJECT OUT OF THE COMMUNITY WHILE CONCENTRATING ITS ADVERSE IMPACTS WITH THAT. FURTHER AGENCIES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO CONSIDER ENVIRONMENTAL AID IT BY MAIL JOHNSON WOULD MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT POLLUTING FACILITIES. NO WHERE IS THIS MORE EVIDENT WITH THEM WITH CALIFORNIA'S MAIN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE TOOL EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN. AMONG OTHER THINGS EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN REQUIRED THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND AIR DISTRICTS TO IDENTIFY AND WORK WITH INVITE HIGHLY ENVIRONMENTALLY BURDEN COMMUNITIES. DEVELOP EMISSION REDUCTIONS OF MODERN PLANS. YET LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AD STATE AGENCIES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO CONSIDER EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN PLANS. AS A RESULT NEW POLLUTING INDUSTRIES CONTINUE TO BE APPROVED. IN AND AROUND OVER BURDEN COMMUNITIES. EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND ONE CORRECT THESE DEFICIENCIES BY REQUIRING MITIGATION MEASUREMENTS THAT DIRECTLY BENEFIT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU'RE GOING TO COLLUDED COMMUNITY EFFORTS TO ELIMINATE THAT POLLUTION NEED TO BENEFIT THOSE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING THE VOTE TO BE THINKING AT THE MOST. LIKEWISE AB ONE THOUSAND ONE WOULD REQUIRE AGENCIES TO CONSIDER ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE WHILE CONSIDERING NEW PROJECTS. LASTLY IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THIS PROJECT WOULD NOT PREDETERMINE THE OUTCOME OF LOCAL DECISION MAKING RATHER IS JUST MAKING SURE. THAT WE DO NOT WITH THAT WE DO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY NOT CONTINUE CHOOSING TO CONCENTRATE POLLUTION IN OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU SO MUCH. NOW WE WILL GO TO OPPOSITION ON AB TO THE ONE WE GOTTA ADAM REGAL FROM CAL CHAMBER AND STILL BE FAR FROM THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING- WELL CBI. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ADAMANTLY WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN OPPOSITION. I WANT TO BEGIN BY CREDITING THE AUTHOR FOR HER STEADFAST COMMITMENT TO READING HISTORICAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND GOT IT IN OUR COMMUNITY. I WANT TO BE CLEAR OUR OPPOSITION TO THE BILL IS NOT WITH THE AUTHOR'S INTENT TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITY. BUT WITH A PROPOSAL TO EXPAND SEAT BUT TO OVERLAY NEW AND HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE STANDARD NOT ONLY AGENCIES. AND TO LIMIT THEIR DISCRETION. HE WAS AN EXTRAORDINARILY COMPLEX AND ALL ENCOMPASSING ENVIRONMENTAL LAW WITH A MULTITUDE OF SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENT INTENDED TO ANALYZE. QUANTIFY DISCLOSE AND MITIGATE THE PROJECT CAN IMPACT WORKABLE. THIS BILL OVERLAYS NEW STANDARDS ABOUT WHAT IS QUOTE FAIR OR QUOTE MEANINGFUL PARTICIPATION OVER EVERY FINDING UNDER SEEK WHAT. THAT PROVIDE PROJECT OPPONENTS WITH NEW LITIGATION AVENUES UNDER AN APARTMENT STATUTE ALREADY. RIFE WITH NAME THE ABUSE. THE BILL WHARTON STATE HOUSING WHEN HOME PRICE ARE EIGHT FEET EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND RENT IT AT ALL TIME HIGHS. SECOND THERE ARE EXISTING LAWS WHICH ALREADY ACHIEVED THE BILL'S INTENT TO ADDRESS LAND USE DISCRIMINATION IN CALIFORNIA AND DO SO WITHOUT EXACERBATING KNOWN PROBLEMS WITH EQUAL. LEGISLATURE PASSED THE TWENTY SIXTEEN SB ONE THOUSAND THAT REQUIRED EVERY FEEDING COUNTY TO INCORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IN A COMPREHENSIVE LONG TERM GENERAL PLAN. AN OPR JUST RECENTLY RELEASED GUIDELINES IN TWENTY TWENTY PROVIDING MORE SPECIFIC ON HOW CITIES AND COUNTIES SHOULD IDENTIFY OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES TO REDUCE HELP TO REDUCE HEALTH RISKS IN A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY. IT'S UNCLEAR TO WHAT AB ONE THOUSAND ONE INTENT TO ADDRESS. AT EIGHT THAT THE ONE THOUSAND FAILED TO DO. FINALLY AB ONE THOUSAND LIMITATION ON MEDICATION MEASURES ARE IN DIRECT CONFLICT WITH EXISTING PROVISIONS OF SEQUEL SEQUEL AND LEAD TO PERVERSE RESULTS. FOR EXAMPLE THE VAST MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES DO NOT WATER. CONSIDER THE GREAT LIFE AND COUNTY THEY DERIVE THE MAJORITY OF THE WATER THE STATE WATER PROJECT. THE COLORADO RIVER IN A LOS ANGELES AQUEDUCT. HUNDREDS OF MILES TO RESIDENTS. IN OTHER WORDS MOST RESIDENTS ARE NOT SOURCE IN OUR WATER DIRECTLY BENEATH THEIR FEET. AB ONE THOUSAND ONE WITH THE JEFF THAT ANY PROJECT THAT COULD IMPACT THAT IS THE BEST NEEDED WATER SUPPLY. MUCH TO DO SO IN THAT COMMUNITY RATHER THAN MITIGATING THE IMPACT OF THE STORE WHERE THE POLLUTION MICHAEL POLLUTING THEIR WATER HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY. THIS CHANGES HE WOULD ACTUALLY WORK FOR ALL RESIDENTS INCLUDING DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. FORTY THREE THAN THAN OTHERS WE URGE A NO VOTE ON EXPANDING PECORA AND REMAIN COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR LEGISLATURE ADMINISTRATION. TO FURTHER SUPPORT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. IN MORE APPROPRIATE AREAS OF LAW THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN WILL BE OVER HERE ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION ALSO UNFORTUNATELY IN OPPOSITION AT A AS YOU JUST HEARD FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE CHAMBER AB TEN ZERO ONE CONTEMPLATES A TRULY SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION SPEAK UP. THIS BILL IS GIVING THE DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY A GREAT DEAL OF CONCERN NOT BECAUSE OF THE POLICY OBJECTIVE I WAS JUST OUTLINED BY MY CHAMBER COLLEAGUES NOT BECAUSE OF THE TOOL OF CHOICE TO EFFECTUATE THE DESIRED POLICY YEAR AFTER YEAR WE HAVE SEEN ATTEMPTS WE HAVE HEARD THE GROWING DISCUSSION IN THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT WAYS. TO CLOSE THE EVER WORSENING ABUSIVE SEQUEL FOR NON ENVIRONMENTAL REASONS BUT UNFORTUNATELY TO NO AVAIL AND THEREFORE THIS LEGISLATURE AND MANY BEFORE IT HAVE CONTINUED TO VOTE FOR THE QUICK EXEMPTIONS FOR SPEAK WITH STREAMLINING FOR PET PROJECT AFTER PET PROJECT. AND UNTIL WE ADDRESS THE ABUSE OF SECRET FOR ALL HOUSING TYPES WHICH AS YOU KNOW IS MORE EXPENSIVE AND MORE OUT OF REACH BY THAT DAY AND GROWING FOR EVERY CALIFORNIANS WE ABSOLUTELY SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERING EXPANSION. THE BILL IS LITIGATION BANK IT'S A BIG U. S. AND THAT IS RIGHT AT THE HEART OF SEQUEL ABUSE THIS WILL BE ANOTHER NAME BE TOOL AT HIGH HOUSING PROJECTS INTO THE COURT AN ATTEMPT TO STALL THEM OR EVEN WORSE RENDERED THOSE PROJECTS IN FEASIBLE. WE ALSO HAVE PROVEN IT THROUGH OTHER POLICIES WE'VE GOTTEN IT. DONE AND ROLLED OUR SLEEVES UP. WE ARE HAPPY WORK ON THIS ISSUE WE BELIEVE THAT THE- INTENT DESIRE AB.

THANK YOU THANK YOU MS GARCIA FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I THINK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND MAKING SURE THAT THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MOST IMPACTED ARE THE ONES THAT RECEIVE THE BENEFIT I THINK THAT IT IS AND I THINK EVEN THE OPPOSITION THEY SAID THE INTENT IS A WORTHY ONE AND I APPRECIATED THEIR COMMENT ON THAT ONE OF THE MEMBERS- ALSO TALKED SAID THAT THERE WERE SOME AMBIGUITIES IN THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION. I'D CERTAINLY ANY AMBIGUITY I WOULD HOPE THAT WOULD BE TAKEN CARE OF BUT I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND WITH THAT I WOULD MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU ARE MISTER BENNETT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF. FIRST I REALLY APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS- EFFORTS WITH THIS BILL IN THE FOCUS- AND- I ALSO AS I LISTEN TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS AND I. THE COMMENT THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO TREAT THE WATER AT THE SOURCE- DID DID THAT MAKE SENSE TO ME IS IN THAT IF YOU HAVE AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT IN THE COMMUNITY. YOU WHAT THE POINT IS YOU WANT TO FIX THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT IF YOU HAVE TO TREAT THE WATER AT THE SOURCE TO FIX ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT THAT FIXES THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF- I DIDN'T THINK THAT WAS A GOOD EXAMPLE BUT I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE AUTHOR- AS- AS YOU MOVE FORWARD I THINK THIS IS A VERY WORTHY BILL. I JUST WANTED TO BE A GREAT BILL IN TERMS OF BEING ACTUALLY PRACTICAL IN ITS IMPLEMENTATION AND COMING FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THE THINGS THAT I SEE THERE. I JUST HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER THAT'S THE CASE AND I AM- PINCH HITTING ON THIS COMMITTEE SO IT'S NOT LIKE I'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH THIS BILL I JUST WOULD ASK THE AUTHOR HAS THIS MOVES FORWARD- TO KEEP WORKING TO ADDRESS THE TRUE. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENT IMPLICATIONS OF THIS BILL BECAUSE IT IS A SIGNIFICANT AND WORTHY EXPANSION BUT IF IT'S NOT PRACTICAL IN ITS IMPLEMENTATION- AND AS WE COME UP WITH ANYTHING ELSE I'LL CERTAINLY TRY TO OFFER THOSE TO YOU BUT IF. FROM A LOCAL GOVERNMENT STANDPOINT IT WON'T ALWAYS BE EASY I'LL JUST. GIVE YOU A ONE ONE THAT DOES STRICTLY. ONE HOW HOW LOCAL DOES THE MEDICATION HAVE TO BE HOW SPECIFIC WHERE DO YOU DRAW THE BOUNDARIES TO ARE THE- ARE THE DACA BOUNDARIES THE ONLY BOUNDARIES WERE TALKING ABOUT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT. ALL LOCAL AREAS WHERE YOU HAVE AN IMPACT IF YOU COULD JUST MAKE SURE YOU TIGHTEN ALL OF THAT UP SO IT'S CLEAR AND YOU DON'T HAVE CONFLICTS WITH OTHER PARTS OF SEQUEL. IT WILL MAKE IT- MORE CREDIBLE AS YOU GO FORWARD BUT I HOPE TO SEE. MORE OF THAT IN THE BILL AND I'M SUPPORTING THIS BECAUSE I WANTED. TO GO FORWARD AND IN IN GET THAT RIGOROUS REVIEW THAT- THAT IT WILL GET AS IT MOVES ITS WAY TO THE LEGISLATURE SO. SURELY BE SUPPORTING IT BUT I APPRECIATE BEING ABLE TO MAKE THESE COMMENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER MOORE SEARCHING. THANK YOU I ALSO LIKE MR BENNETT TO. SUPPORT THE GOAL OF THIS BUILD- BUT I HAVE A- CONCERNS ABOUT HOW IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE- R. HOW CAN BE TIGHTENED UP TO. ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION HI I WANT TO ASK YOU- MS GARCIA GUY IF YOU COULD RESPOND TO. THE CONCERN ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW HOW WOULD HOW WOULD YOU MITIGATE THE IMPACT- DIRECTLY AND EFFECTIVE COMMUNITY WHEN THEY'RE DEALING WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED UPSTREAM. IN ANY CASE WATER. TWO THINGS- I THINK IF SOMETHING'S HAPPENING UP STREAM IT WOULD BE DEALT WITH UP THERE AND SO WE WOULDN'T HAVE THE PROBLEM AND THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY. I COMMUNITY GETS A LOT OF THEIR GROUNDWATER A LOT OF THE WATER FROM GROUNDWATER- AND A LOT OF THE POLLUTION THAT'S HAPPENING THERE IS ACTUALLY MAKING IT TO THE WE'RE HAVING TO TURN OFF WEALTH AND IMPORT- MORE WATER WHICH IS MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE THAN A SUSTAINABLE OUT THERE. I THINK THERE I'VE BEEN HERE THIS IS MY TENTH YEAR. I AND GETTING FOLKS ON BOARD ON THE CONCEPT AND TO COME TO THE TABLE YOU FIX A LITTLE BIT OF WORK ON THIS. SO WHAT I'VE BEEN ASKING MYSELF THE WHOLE TIME I'VE BEEN HERE IS ARE WE GOING TO KEEP TELLING THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT THIS IS GOOD AS IT GETS. WE DO HAVE SEEK WHEN THE BOOKS NOT IT HAS IMPROVED SOMETHING FOR MY COMMUNITY BUT HAS IMPROVED ENOUGH IN MY COMMUNITY. I'M STILL ONE OF THE MOST OVERBURDENED COMMUNITIES I'M PRETTY MUCH ANY AND IF YOU COULD IMAGINE OUT THERE- AN SO HASN'T BEEN ENOUGH AND WE ARE ALWAYS TOLD. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF IT AND THIS OTHER PART OF TOWN OR SOMEPLACE SOUTH AND YOU JUST DEAL WITH. THAT IF IT GETS FOR YOU. SO ARE WE GONNA KEEP TELLING THEM THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE THE SACRIFICE. BY PHONE THEY ARE GOING TO BE AT THE COST OF EVERYONE ELSE'S PROGRESS OUT THERE IN THE YARD. HAVE TO BE DISCUSSED AND FIGURED OUT AND I WELCOME EVERYONE TO THE TABLE TO HELP ME GET IT RIGHT I THINK MY TEN YEAR. IN APAC MATIC AND I TRY TO COMPROMISE AND OFTENTIMES IS BIG LIVES AND UP IN THAT COMPROMISED IF I BRING FOLKS TO THE TABLE TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION FOR BILLS AND- WAITING ONCE AND FOR ALL WE NEED TO SAY WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THOSE COMMUNITIES WHO ARE THE- LENGTH. HAVE BEEN THE BOTH BURDEN AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO START IN THIS IS ONE BILL OF MANY BILLS WE NEED IN THAT COMMUNITY ALSO ONE MAKE SURE THAT IT'S CLEAR THAT. IT'S NOT A ONE AND DONE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THE YOU KNOW THE EXISTENCE OF HOW THIS SOCIETY HAS BEEN AND HOW WE'VE CONSTITUTED THIS COMMITTEE THIS WEEK THIS WAY IT'S NOT JUST OVER AND SO. I ALSO TO IT CLEAR THAT TO WITH MANY MORE AFTER THIS YEAR. I TO MY OF THE STATE AND FIGHT YOU. I DO THANK MR IT'S AND I WALKING INTO ME FOR OUT HOW TO MAKE THE NETWORK AT THIS TOGETHER CAN ACTUALLY. LOOK UP TO. THAT WE LET. THE AND PUT. TEETH INTO. OKAY I MEAN I ALSO. WELL I- RECOGNIZE THAT THAT YOU COMMUTER AND LA- DO- CARRIED PORTION BURDEN OF- THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS BUT I'M JUST ON THIS ISSUE OF- WATER IMPACTS AND WHO DEALS WITH THE CONSEQUENCES DOWNSTREAM I MEAN I JUST WANT TO REMIND YOU THAT YOU KNOW I. AS AS YOU KNOW I REPRESENT A COASTAL DISTRICT THAT- OFTEN COMPLAINS ABOUT HOW YOU KNOW THE MIDDLE CLASS TO AFFLUENT COMMUNITIES IN MY DISTRICT THAT LIVE ON THE COAST OFTEN COMPLAINED ABOUT HAVING TO DEAL WITH THE WATER CLEAN UP COSTS OF THE POLLUTION UPSTREAM AND SO IT'S NOT JUST- THE- YOU KNOW WHAT WHILE I APPRECIATE YOUR FRAMING THIS BILL AS A ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE BILL- YOU KNOW THERE THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES THAT DEAL WITH. THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS- YOU KNOW WITH ESPECIALLY OF WATER UPSTREAM AND IT'S NOT JUST NECESSARILY THE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND SO I WOULD JUST ASK THAT YOU CONSIDER THAT AS AS YOU GO FOR THE OTHER CONCERN- IS THAT IN A WHILE I TO- YOU KNOW- PLAN ON VOTING FOR THIS BILL. A TODAY. THAT YOU KNOW I. AS A LAWYER I ALWAYS WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- THAT WE CAN. TRY TO TIGHTEN UP THE TERMS- SO THAT IT IT'S A- WE CAN TRY TO AVOID- YOU KNOW- LITIGATION ABUSE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND I CAN SEE HOW. YOU KNOW A TERM LIKE MANY MEANINGFUL INVOLVEMENT OF A- OF A COMMUNITY. THAT COULD BE RIPE FOR ABUSE AND SO I HOPE YOU CAN. FIGURE OUT A WAY TO TIGHTEN UP THAT LANGUAGE ALSO THANK YOU. WE'LL DEFINITELY KEEP WORKING ON THAT AND I DON'T WNT TO DO A DIFFERENT TACK BUT- FOLKS IN MY FOR THE ROLE OF OFTEN FEELS LIKE THEY'RE ALSO PAYING EXTRA TO REPLENISH. THE GROUNDWATER IN THE SCHOOLS THE COMMUNITIES- TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT FALL AND FUSION YOU KNOW- THE SENATE AFFECT ALL OF OUR TABLE WATER SO IT IS ALL INTERCONNECTED. OUT THERE AND SO I DON'T THINK IT'S DONE BUT- THERE'S BEEN PLENTY A LAWSUIT FROM MY FINANCING THAT WAY OF THE DAY SO THAT OTHERS HAD A TON OF WATER AS WELL. CAN MISTER FLORES THANK YOU MEASURE. THANK YOU- I'M IS A LITTLE BIT AWAY FROM WATER AND I DO IF IT'S ALRIGHT WITH CHAIR WOULD LIKE THE CHAMBER TO CLARIFY SOME OF THEIR OPPOSITION AS RELATES TO THAT. EXAMPLE I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO GET THAT CLARIFICATION- IF ADAM COULD EVER SO BRIEFLY- ADDRESS THAT. BUT I DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT THEIR REAL QUICK. AND BECAUSE IN MY DISTRICT WE TEND TO DEAL WITH A LOT OF THE BAY AREA ISSUES AS WELL. AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE ONLY STEP DOWNSTREAM. IT IS A VERY- IMPORTANT. QUESTION BECAUSE ONE OF OUR OTHER MAJOR ISSUES IN THE CENTRE DOLLARS HOUSING. SO IF WE'RE EALING WITH OUR PROBLEMS PLUS THE BAY AREA PROBLEMS AND THAT CAN BE USED TO. STALL IN HOUSE PROJECT IDEA THAT IT IS CONNECTED. IT'S ABSOLUTELY CONNECTED AND I WOULD JUST- ENCOURAGE US TO THINK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE- THOUGH WE MAY BE FIXING THE PROBLEM HERE OR THERE. IT'S CREATING ANOTHER ONE AND SO IF WE COULD JUST HAVE ADAM JUST CLARIFY HIS REMARKS AND- ALLEN JUST KEEP IT SHORT. SURE PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU BYE. THANK YOU THANK YOU CHAIR I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENNETT'S POINT THAT THE AT THE MINIMUM TO CHECK THE SPOKE TO IT BUT IN THE ACTUAL BILL SAYS THE A FACT SHALL BE MITIGATED DIRECTLY IN THE AFFECTED DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES MY POINT ABOUT WATER IS WE'RE NOT DRAWING WATER FROM UNDERNEATH COMMUNITY. WHERE PROJECT MAY ACTUALLY HAVE A DISCHARGE YOU WANT TO GET IT AT OF SORTS THAT WE HUNDRED A MILE UPSTREAM FROM THE COMMUNITY IMPACTED INFO AT POSTED ON THE COMMITTEE THE LANGUAGE MATTERS AND SO IF YOU REQUIRE THE MITIGATION TO BE DIRECTLY IN THAT COMMUNITY ARE NOT ACTUALLY STOP IN A POINT OF DISCHARGE SO IT ACTUALLY I THINK IT'S WORSE AS AN ENVIRONMENTAL OUTCOME. THE DO IT ACTION THAT WOULD MEAN YOU'D HAVE TO. BUT THE PEOPLE HAVE Y. CREATED NEW. APPLE INTRICATE PLANT IN THE COMMUNITY TO CLEAN WATER THAT WHAT I. DO IN A MILE SOUTH THE PEOPLE IDENTIFIES. THE IMPACT. AND IT IT DIFFICULT THE MITIGATION TO ADDRESS THAT. SO IT IT ESSENTIALLY BEFORE YOU HAVE TO START MITIGATING UNDER SPEAK WHAT THE- SORRY IF THERE'S ANY CONFUSION ABOUT THAT APPRECIATE THE ATTEMPT TO CLARIFY THANK YOU OR COMMENTS I DON'T SEE ANY. I'M JUST A YOU KNOW THE FOR A LITTLE BIT IT AT ME JUST IN THE INTEREST OF TRYING TO CLARIFY BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO THIS I GUESS THIS IS MY INTERPRETATION WE HAVE STAFF HERE I JUST GET IT OUT THERE- MAY NOT BE BACK HERE THE FACT THAT- IF THERE'S AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ON WATER OR WHATEVER ERROR OR WHATEVER- IN A IN A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY TO WHAT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE INTENT OF THE BILL WOULD SAY. IF PEOPLE ARE GETTING SICK BECAUSE THE WATER IS BAD YOU'VE GOT TO CHANGE THE WATERS OF THE PEOPLE ARE GETTING SICK IF YOUR PROJECT IS GOING TO MAKE THE PEOPLE SICK NOW THAT MEANS YOU CHANGE WHAT DOES DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT IN THAT COMMUNITY BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THE MITIGATION IN THAT COMMUNITY IF YOU. HAVE TO CLEAN UP THE AIR THAT IS YOU KNOW ASSEMBLY IF YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING IN A IN A IN A COMMUNITY IF YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING TO A PROJECT THAT IS NOW- LET'S SEE YOU REMOVE SOME KIND OF FILTER THAT ALLOWS NOW DIRTY WATER TO GET IT YOU'VE GOT TO GO WHEREVER IT IS YOU REMOVED THAT FILTER TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY THAT'S THE INTENTION I HOPE THAT THAT. HELPS CLARIFY FOR THE CHAMBER OF WHAT I WAS TRYING TO HAVE TO RESPOND TO IN TERMS OF THAT I DON'T THINK I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S ACCURATE TO SAY THEY THEY THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO GO SOME PLACE OUTSIDE OF THE COMMUNITY IF THAT'S WHAT WILL SOLVE THE IMPACT IN THE COMMUNITY BUT THE POINT IS. DON'T GO OUTSIDE OF THE COMMUNITY TO MAKE OR SOMEPLACE ELSE AND YOU PAY FOR THIS COMMUNITY TO CONTINUE TO BE DISADVANTAGED I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT YOU ALSO TRYING TO DO WITH THE BILL AND THAT'S AT LEAST MINOR WAS THAT THE YOU MUCH.

MADAM CHAIR CAN YOU HEAR ME YES PLEASE GO AHEAD- THIS IS CHRIS BOLLINGER ON BEHALF OF THE ASPHALT ROOFING MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION WE WANT TO BE LISTED AS LEAD OPPOSITION- CAN YOU AFFORD ME JUST A MINUTE I'LL BE BRIEF. YOU'LL PLEASE GO AHEAD JUST ONE MINUTE- THE ASPHALT ROOFING MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION IS THE TRADE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING NORTH AMERICAN PRODUCERS OF- PRODUCTS INCLUDING ASPHALT SHINGLES ASPHALT LOW SLOPE. ROOF MEMBRANE SYSTEMS IN THEIR RAW MATERIAL SUPPLIERS WE'VE BEEN OPPOSE POSITION ON AB TWELVE TWENTY SEVEN FOR ALL THE REASONS WE LAID OUT IN OUR LETTER TO THE COMMITTEE I'LL TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF THESE REASONS. THE CDC ALREADY HAS THE STATE GOVERNMENT APPROVED ROBUST CODE CODE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS WHICH CONSIDERS NEWLY DEVELOPMENT NEWLY DEVELOPED AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGIES AND BY LAW UNDER THE WARRANT ALQUIST ACT-CAUTIOUSLY CATION OUR INDUSTRIES WORK DIRECTLY WITH THE COMMISSION SINCE TWO THOUSAND THREE POLICE FIRST BECAME A TOPIC OF CONSIDERATION. WE RESPONDED THE COMMISSION ENERGY EFFICIENT TARGETS WITH MATERIALS THAT PROVIDE VALUABLE LEGITIMATE OPTIONS TO HOMEOWNERS. WHEN THEY SEE YOU SEE SHOULD EXAMINE BENEFITS OTHER EFFICIENT BUILDING MATERIALS BEFORE ADOPTING AN UNWIELDY BILL THAT LIMITS CONSUMER CHOICE AND IMPOSES SIGNIFICANT COSTS BURDENS MOREOVER PRODUCT AVAILABILITY REMAINS A CHALLENGE AND THIS IS IMPORTANT. THEY'RE CURRENTLY ZERO ASPHALT ROOFING MATERIALS AND ZERO WOULD CHECK MATERIALS THAT CAN MEET THE THRESHOLD SET BY THIS PROPOSED LEGISLATION WE KNOW IT'S EARLY IN THE PROCESS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUED- THE CONTINUE DIALOGUE WITH THE AUTHOR- BUT THE FEW OPTIONS AVAILABLE THAT CAN COMPLY A VIRTUALLY ALL WHITE. IN COLOR AND FOR THOSE REASONS WERE PUBLISHED. AB TWELVE TWENTY SEVEN THANK YOU. K. OPERATOR ARE THERE ANY. OTHER ADDITIONAL WITNESSES. WE WILL OPEN UP- PARDON ME THERE ARE NO OTHER ADDITIONAL WITNESSES AT THIS TIME THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS FOR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SEVEN ONE FOUR THANK YOU MATTER- BUT IT IS INTERESTING BUILT TO BE QUITE HONEST WITH YOU BUT I AM HAS THERE BEEN ANY. COST ANALYSIS ON THIS- THE COST OF A STANDARD ISSUE ROOF VERSUS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE YEAH IT'S BEEN QUITE A BIT OF ANALYSIS SO IF IN FIRST YEAR INCLUDING COST OF THESE ROOF TECHNOLOGIES ARE NO DIFFERENT ROOF. MATERIALS PLUS SAVINGS- FROM A COOLING COSTS AND OTHER SAVINGS AT FIFTY CENTS PER SQUARE FOOT SAVED IN THE FIRST YEAR AND THOSE ARE ON GOING SAVINGS SO THE SAVINGS WOULD. PROBABLY BE GREAT IN THE OUT YEARS BECAUSE THAT FIRST YEAR SAVINGS FACTORS IN THE COST OF THE NEW MATERIAL HELLO THESE PANELS LAST. A TYPICAL ROOFTOP MATERIALS THROUGH THIRTY YEARS YEAH IT'S THIS JUST A ANOTHER REPORTER LIKE OTHERS. MR SAY ARE TELL. IN A BAR MY CARE- THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONCERNS ON THIS ISSUE ONE OF THE ISSUES I HAVE WITH THIS IN A LOT OF BILLS IS YOU KNOW OF COURSE I SAID ON THE HOUSING COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT SIDE. ALRIGHT COMMITTEE ALSO WE HAVE THIS WE'RE TRYING HARD TO ADDRESS ONE OF THE MOST IF NOT THE SEX SECOND OR FIRST MOST DIFFICULT ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND EVERYTHING THAT WE DO THAT ADDS COST TO THAT HOUSING IS PILING UP WERE AT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A DOOR. TO BUILD. AN AFFORDABLE UNIT. AND THIS JUST KEEPS GOING UP AND I REALIZE THAT THERE IS SOME TYPE OF CAPTURE LATER ON. BUT IT'S THE UP FRONT COST FOR A FAMILY TO GET INTO A HOME. THESE THIS THIS TYPE OF ISSUE IS GOING ARE THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS- AND ADDITIONS TO THE TO WHATEVER HOUSE COSTS. IT SOMEDAY WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO PICK. WHAT DO WE WANT PEOPLE TO BE ABLETO AFFORD A HOUSE OR DO WE WANT A LITTLE BIT LESSER OF THE TECHNOLOGY NOW SO THEY CAN GET IN OR WE GONNA DEMAND THE TECHNOLOGY AND PRICE PEOPLE OUT. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW OUR PRICING A MOUNTAIN AND OUR KIDS ARE MOVING. BACK EAST AND THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING WITH THEM. BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO BE AWAY FROM THEIR KIDS. SO THAT'S MY CONCERN WITH THIS THIS BILL IN A LOT OF OTHER BILLS. IS WE HAVE BUILT IN COSTS THEY'RE GOING INTO THE HOUSE THE PILING UP. AND INSTEAD OF GETTING CLOSER TO AFFORDABLE. WE'RE GETTING FARTHER AWAY. AND WE'RE NEVER GOING TO FIX THIS PROBLEM IF WE KEEP DOING. SO THAT'S MY COMMENTS THANKS. AND- ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. I DON'T SEE ANY WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE IT. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE A MOTION AND I THINK A NUMBER OF- WE DO OKAY WE HAVE A- MOTION AND A SECOND- THE MOTION. IS DUE PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS SECRETARY PLEASE CALL.

WHAT THANK YOU. CAN HAVE A HOT SEVEN VOTES WILL BE THAT OPEN THANKS THANKS. AND NOW OUR FINAL BILL AB TEN SIXTY SEVEN OUR AUTHOR IS- MR TANG BUT IT WILL BE PRESENTED BY MR STONE. PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS FIRST MR TANG APPRECIATES THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE BY- STAFF BUT WITH HIS STAFF AND HE'S HAPPY TO TAKE THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE OFFERED THIS IS ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S BOTTLE BUILT CANS IMPLEMENTATIONS OF COURSE WAS A BILL THAT WAS. PUT IN PLACE FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS AGO. AND THIS LEGISLATORS BEEN WORKING TO TRY TO UPDATE IT OVER THE YEARS WITH VERY LIMITED SUCCESS AND ONE OF THEISSUES THOUGH. THAT HAVE. REALLY STARTS TO SHOW ITSELF MORE AND MORE AND MORE IS THE NOTION OF THE PENALTY THAT GETS PAID. BY A LOT OF THE LARGER RETAILERS WHO INSTEAD OF TAKING BACK BOTTLES UNDER THE C. R. V. PROGRAM ARE JUST HAPPY TO PAY THE PENALTIES. AND THAT THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS ONE IS WE MISS THEIR PARTICIPATION. BUT THE OTHERS THEN IT PUSHES ONTO THE SMALLER RETAILERS IN THE SAME AREA WHO DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY OF BEING ABLE JUST TO PAY THE PENALTIES. AND THEN THERE OBLIGATION THEY'RE TAKING BACK A LOT OF THESE MATERIALS IS HIS EXACERBATED AND IN AREAS LIKE MINE THIS IS BECOME A REAL A REAL ISSUE WHERE WE HAVE VERY HIGH LEVELS OF CURBSIDE RECYCLING. THEN THE IMPACT ON THE- FORCING THE SMALLER RETAILERS TO TAKE BACK A LOT OF THE CRB MATERIALS IT BECOMES AN EXTRAORDINARY BURDEN ON THEM EVEN WHEN WE HAVE VERY HIGH SUCCESS RATES AND VERY HIGH LEVELS OF RECYCLING SO THE IMPACT OF THIS SYRUPY FEE IS DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON THE AREAS THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO IMPLEMENT. AND WE'VE TRIED OFTENTIMES TO REALLY LOOK AT HOW WE CAN BRING THIS TO BE PROGRAM UP TO SPEED AND THE ADMINISTRATION HAS CONTINUALLY PUSHED BACK AND NOT REALLY WANTING TO LOOK AT WHAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED BEFORE SO WHAT BETTER THINGS BILL DOES TEN TEN SIXTY SEVEN. AS A REQUIRES A STUDY AND I THINK IT IS LONG PAST TIME THAT WE GET DATA OUT OF CAL RECYCLE TO LET US KNOW HOW THE PROGRAM AND WORKING WHAT THE IMPACTS ARE WHAT THE DISPARITIES ARE BETWEEN LARGE LARGE RETAILERS SMALL RETAILERS ESPECIALLY IN SOME OF THE SMALLER AREAS THE DIFFERENCES IN THOSE AREAS THAT HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF RECYCLING ALREADY AND LESS LEVELS OF RECYCLING AND HOW WE CAN MAKE THIS THE BEST INCENTIVE POSSIBLE. AS IT WAS ORIGINALLY INTENDED AND THAT'S WHAT MR KING'S BILL DOES AND I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON. B. TEN SIXTY. THERE IS A WITNESS I BELIEVE MARK MURRAY FROM CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE. AND WITHOUT I ASK THAT THE WITNESS BE ABLE TO PRESENT AND ASK FOR YOUR VOTE SHARE. OPERATOR KEEP THESE OPEN UP THE LINE FOR- MARC MURRAY FROM CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE OF. BOB YOUR MEMBERS MARK MURRAY WITH CALIFORNIA AGAINST WASTE IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE HAS CAPTURED THE ISSUE PERFECTLY THERE ARE NUMBER OF COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE INADEQUATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR REDEMPTION RECYCLING THE FAIL SAFE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE IN STORE REDEMPTION BUT THE FAIL SAFE ABOUT DATED AND FAILING- AB TEN SIXTY SEVEN PROPOSES A POP BOTTLE PROCESS FOR ANALYZING THE ISSUE RIGHT SIZING IN STORE REDEMPTION AND PAYMENT SYSTEM TO CREATE REAL INCENTIVES FOR COMMUNITY BASED RECYCLING CENTRES WITHOUT BURDENING SMALL MOM AND POP STORES WITH NO OBLIGATION THAT THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY. WE URGE YOU NOT VOTE. THANK YOU WE DON'T HAVE ANY WITNESSES REGISTER IN OPPOSITION- BUT WE WILL TAKE ADDITIONAL WITNESSES STARTING WITH ANY IN THE HEARING ROOM. C. N.
