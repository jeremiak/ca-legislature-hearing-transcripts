00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:33.419

00:37:54.939 --> 00:37:56.140
HOMELESSNESS.

00:37:56.207 --> 00:37:56.974
IT ALSO TURNS OUT THE TOTAL

00:37:57.041 --> 00:37:58.409
YARDS LOSE MONEY WITH THESE

00:37:58.476 --> 00:38:00.011
PROVISIONS BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO

00:38:00.077 --> 00:38:01.646

BEFORE A LIEN AUCTION ALE.

00:38:04.215 --> 00:38:05.082
AND THE AVERAGE STORAGE AND

00:38:05.149 --> 00:38:06.917
LEANS SO COST FAR EXCEED THE

00:38:06.984 --> 00:38:08.386
AVERAGE SALES PRICE OF THESE

00:38:08.452 --> 00:38:10.955
TOWED CARS FOR SIMILAR REASONS

00:38:11.022 --> 00:38:11.522
CITIES RUNNING THESE TOàN

00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:12.990
PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN LOSING

00:38:13.057 --> 00:38:14.191
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

00:38:14.258 --> 00:38:15.860
THIS IS WHY WE ORIGINALLY

00:38:15.926 --> 00:38:17.094
PROPOSED TO ELIMINATE THESE

00:38:17.161 --> 00:38:18.396
PROVISIONS TO END THE CYCLE OF

00:38:18.462 --> 00:38:20.264
POVERTY THAT'S NOT WORKING FOR

00:38:20.331 --> 00:38:27.104
FAMILIES FOR TOW YARDS OR CITIES.

00:38:27.171 --> 00:38:27.705
KNOWING JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO

00:38:27.772 --> 00:38:28.339
EXPLAIN WHAT THE BILL DOES NOT

00:38:28.406 --> 00:38:29.473
DO BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN QUITE A

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:30.107
BIT OF MISINFORMATION ABOUT THIS

00:38:30.174 --> 00:38:30.307
BILL.

00:38:30.374 --> 00:38:30.908
THERE BEEN SOME ADVOCATES FOR

00:38:30.975 --> 00:38:32.176
CITIES HAVE SUGGESTED THAT

00:38:32.243 --> 00:38:33.811
SOMEHOW THIS BILL AND STALLING.

00:38:33.878 --> 00:38:35.646
THAT IS FALSE THERE ARE OVER

00:38:35.713 --> 00:38:37.248
THIRTY GROUNDS TO TOW CARS UNDER

00:38:37.314 --> 00:38:38.582
CALIFORNIA LAW.

00:38:38.649 --> 00:38:40.117
MOST HAVE TO DO WITH PUBLIC

00:38:40.184 --> 00:38:41.752
SAFETY IN TRAFFIC FLOW WERE NOT

00:38:41.819 --> 00:38:43.587
TOUCHING THE VAST MAJORITY OF

00:38:43.654 --> 00:38:44.422
THESE.

00:38:44.488 --> 00:38:45.623
SECONDLY THERE SOME CITIES THAT

00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:46.924
HAVE SUGGESTED THAT WE ARE GOING

00:38:46.991 --> 00:38:48.626
TO ALLOW ABANDONED CARS ON THE

00:38:48.693 --> 00:38:49.927
STREET WITH THIS BILL.

00:38:49.994 --> 00:38:51.662
THAT IS ALSO FALSE THERE IS A

00:38:51.729 --> 00:38:53.397
SPECIFIC TOWING PROVISION THAT

00:38:53.464 --> 00:38:54.699
ALLOWS CITIES TO TOW CARS THAT

00:38:54.765 --> 00:38:56.167
ARE BANNED IN WRECKED

00:38:56.233 --> 00:38:57.301
INOPERATIVE EXCEPT TRUCK.

00:38:57.368 --> 00:38:58.703
WERE NOT TOUCHING THOSE

00:38:58.769 --> 00:39:00.004
PROVISIONS.

00:39:00.071 --> 00:39:01.072
YOU MAY HAVE ALSO HEARD THE

00:39:01.138 --> 00:39:02.440
SUGGESTION THAT SOMEHOW WE ARE

00:39:02.506 --> 00:39:03.674
REMOVING LOCAL CONTROL.

00:39:03.741 --> 00:39:05.176
THAT'S A DOUBLE ALSE BECAUSE

00:39:05.242 --> 00:39:06.811
THERE IS ANOTHER TOLL PROVISION

00:39:06.877 --> 00:39:07.845
THAT WE'RE NOT TOUCHING WITH

00:39:07.912 --> 00:39:10.181
THIS BILL THAT ALLOWS ANY CITY

00:39:10.247 --> 00:39:12.249
TO PASS ANY LOCAL LAW TO REQUIRE

00:39:12.316 --> 00:39:13.918
TOWING IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE.

00:39:13.984 --> 00:39:17.555
THIS BILL SUPPORTS PURE LOCAL

00:39:17.621 --> 00:39:18.322
CONTROL.

00:39:18.389 --> 00:39:19.724
LET ME CONCLUDE BY DISCUSSING

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:20.357
THE SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS THAT

00:39:20.424 --> 00:39:20.624
WE TOOK.

00:39:20.691 --> 00:39:22.193
OUR REGIONAL BILL VOTED ON BY

00:39:22.259 --> 00:39:23.894
THE ASSEMBLY WOULD HAVE DELETED

00:39:23.961 --> 00:39:25.663
THE THREE POVERTY TOWING

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:26.263
PROVISIONS THAT WE'RE TALKING

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:27.198
ABOUT HERE.

00:39:27.264 --> 00:39:28.666
AFTER NUMEROUS DISCUSSIONS WITH

00:39:28.733 --> 00:39:30.067

DELETE ONE OF THE THREE TELLING

00:39:35.806 --> 00:39:36.540
GROUNDS.

00:39:36.607 --> 00:39:37.975
THE AMENDED VERSION OF OUR BILL

00:39:38.042 --> 00:39:39.944
WOULD ALLOW CITIES TO CONTINUE

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:42.480
TO TELL FOR EXPIRED REGISTRATION.

00:39:42.546 --> 00:39:43.447
THE MINUTE VERSION OF A BILL

00:39:43.514 --> 00:39:44.949
WILL ALSO ALLOW CITIES TO

00:39:45.015 --> 00:39:46.684
CONTINUE TO TOW CARS THAT HAVE

00:39:46.751 --> 00:39:47.985
BEEN LEGALLY PARKED ON PUBLIC

00:39:48.052 --> 00:39:49.053
STREETS.

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:50.354
CURRENT LAW SAYS A CAR TO BE

00:39:50.421 --> 00:39:51.722
TOWED AFTER SEVENTY TWO HOURS

00:39:51.789 --> 00:39:54.225
WITHOUT NOTICE SINCE MANY CITIES

00:39:54.291 --> 00:39:54.825
TOLD US THAT THEY DON'T TELL

00:39:54.892 --> 00:39:56.093

CAR OWNERS BEFORE TELL.

00:40:00.598 --> 00:40:02.399
ARMAMENTS WOULD ALLOW A CAR TO

00:40:02.466 --> 00:40:05.169
BE TOWED AFTER NOTICE AND TEN

00:40:05.236 --> 00:40:05.836
BUSINESS DAYS AND I WANT TO JUST

00:40:05.903 --> 00:40:06.604

00:40:21.085 --> 00:40:22.553
REQUIREMENT.

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:23.687
OUR BILL DOES MOVE TO AND TOES

00:40:23.754 --> 00:40:24.321
FOR ONE PROVISION AND THAT IS

00:40:24.388 --> 00:40:25.856
FOR UNPAID PARKING TICKETS WHICH

00:40:25.923 --> 00:40:28.292
IS THE PUREST VERSION OF TELLING

00:40:28.359 --> 00:40:29.794
SOMEONE TO COLLECT A MINOR DEBT.

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:31.462
I WOULD NOTE THAT OUR BILL DOES

00:40:31.529 --> 00:40:33.264
NOT MAKE IT LEGAL NOT TO PAY

00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:35.099
PARKING TICKETS IN FACT OUR BILL

00:40:35.166 --> 00:40:36.400
WOULD ENSURE THAT LOCAL

00:40:36.467 --> 00:40:38.002
GOVERNMENTS WOULD USE ALL

00:40:38.068 --> 00:40:40.304
CURRENTLY AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVES

CHOOSE DALY BETWEEN PAIN RANT

00:44:27.631 --> 00:44:29.967

REFERENCE TOWED INTO DEBT

00:44:36.173 --> 00:44:38.108
HIGHLIGHTS YET ANOTHER WAY IN

00:44:38.175 --> 00:44:39.977
WHICH THESE PAUL THESE POLICIES

00:44:40.044 --> 00:44:42.413
ARE HARMING THE POOR BY THE HIGH

00:44:42.479 --> 00:44:44.014
COST OF THESE TICKETS.

00:44:44.081 --> 00:44:47.584
ARE LITERALLY -- CAUSING US TO

00:44:47.651 --> 00:44:51.021
SEE CARS THAT ARE BEING -- TOWED

ON THE STREET.

00:45:00.431 --> 00:45:01.799
THESE ARE THE THREE MOST

00:45:01.865 --> 00:45:04.101
SIGNIFICANT REASONS THAT WE SAW

00:45:04.168 --> 00:45:06.103
IN OUR RESEARCH THAT SHOWED THAT

00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:07.971
WHEN A PERSON -- GOT THEIR CAR

00:45:08.038 --> 00:45:09.940
TOWED THEY DID NOT GET IT BACK

00:45:10.007 --> 00:45:11.575
WE DIDN'T CHOOSE THESE THREE

00:45:11.642 --> 00:45:14.011
ITEMS AT RANDOM BUT INSTEAD VERY

00:45:14.078 --> 00:45:16.013
MUCH IN SPECIFIC BECAUSE THESE

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:17.181
ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE TRULY

00:45:17.247 --> 00:45:17.948
IMPACTING.

00:45:18.015 --> 00:45:20.484
OUR CLIENTS -- SO AS WE SIT HERE

00:45:26.323 --> 00:45:27.991
TO ARE SIGNIFICANT -- AND

00:45:28.058 --> 00:45:29.760
FRANKLY A LITTLE BIT PAINFUL FOR

00:45:29.827 --> 00:45:31.795
US BECAUSE THEY DO LIMIT THE

00:45:31.862 --> 00:45:33.397
APPLICATION OF THE BILL AND IT

00:45:33.464 --> 00:45:35.365
MEANS THAT NOT ALL OF THE FOLKS

00:45:35.432 --> 00:45:36.333

WE STILL THINK THIS IS A

00:45:44.374 --> 00:45:45.709
SUBSTANTIAL STEP FORWARD FOR

00:45:45.776 --> 00:45:47.044

00:45:52.149 --> 00:45:52.683

WE HAVE A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE ON

00:52:52.202 --> 00:52:53.270
HOW THINGS WORK IN A TOW YARD

00:52:53.336 --> 00:52:54.704
BECAUSE IT'S OUR INDUSTRY THAT'S

00:52:54.771 --> 00:52:56.039
HIRED. TO GET A CAR OUT OF THE

DUE IS PUT ON THE BACK END.

00:53:06.016 --> 00:53:07.017
OF THAT PERSON'S CAR NOTES THEY

00:53:07.083 --> 00:53:08.018
CAN MAKE THEIR PAYMENTS AND

00:53:09.653 --> 00:53:11.588

00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:17.093
TO YOU.

00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:18.795
MOST PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA WHEN

THEY GO TO A TOW YARD WHAT

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:21.264

00:53:21.331 --> 00:53:22.632
PRICING MATRIX.

00:53:27.404 --> 00:53:28.705
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

THE CONSUMERS USUALLY WILL PAY

00:53:30.974 --> 00:53:33.476
3240% MORE I KNOW THIS BECAUSE

00:53:33.543 --> 00:53:35.645

BUT NOBODY'S ADDRESSING THE

00:53:55.865 --> 00:53:57.500
ISSUE OF HOW THE FEES ARE

00:53:57.567 --> 00:53:59.202
CHARGING HOW A CONSUMER THE

OF THINGS YOU KNOW AS I I WAS --

00:58:23.733 --> 00:58:25.435

00:58:28.805 --> 00:58:30.874
THAT OF MY COMMUNITIES AND MY

00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:32.408
POLICE OFFICERS WHITE.

00:58:32.475 --> 00:58:33.910
VALUE THEIR OPINION AND AND AND

00:58:33.977 --> 00:58:35.078
AGAIN BEING FROM LOCAL

00:58:35.144 --> 00:58:36.946
GOVERNMENT I UNDERSTAND THAT --

00:58:37.013 --> 00:58:38.615
THE FEAR OF LOSING THE LOCAL

00:58:38.681 --> 00:58:39.549
CONTROL.

00:58:39.616 --> 00:58:41.551
BUT I WANT TO POINT OUT JUST --

00:58:41.618 --> 00:58:43.052
THREE THINGS THAT WERE REALLY

00:58:43.119 --> 00:58:44.687
THE BIGGEST CONCERN AND I KNOW

00:58:44.754 --> 00:58:46.656
THAT AS A LOCAL COUNCIL MEMBER I

00:58:46.723 --> 00:58:48.424
HAVE PUT SOME ORDINANCE IN PLACE

00:58:48.491 --> 00:58:50.927
AS IT. TO TO TOWING AND SO I

00:58:50.994 --> 00:58:52.595
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT CITIES

00:58:52.662 --> 00:58:54.297
CAN STILL KEEP THEIR LOCAL

00:58:54.364 --> 00:58:55.932
ORDINANCE AND THAT WOULD NOT

00:58:55.999 --> 00:58:56.599
CHANGE.

00:58:56.666 --> 00:58:58.067
SO I WANT TO POINT OUT TO ONE

00:58:58.134 --> 00:58:59.335
SECTION THAT STILL IN THE BILL

00:58:59.402 --> 00:59:01.004
JUST TO CLARIFY FOR A LOT OF

00:59:01.070 --> 00:59:02.772
PEOPLE ESPECIALLY IN MY

00:59:02.839 --> 00:59:03.706
COMMUNITIES.

00:59:03.773 --> 00:59:06.376
I AND THAT IS SECTION TWO TWO

00:59:06.442 --> 00:59:07.143
SIX FIVE ONE OF THE VEHICLE CODE

00:59:07.210 --> 00:59:08.778
THAT STATE THAT ALL CITIES CAN

00:59:08.845 --> 00:59:11.247
STILL TOTAL A CAR IF IT'S PARKED

00:59:11.314 --> 00:59:12.482
ARE LEFT STANDING WERE LOCAL

00:59:12.548 --> 00:59:13.383
AUTHORITIES.

00:59:13.449 --> 00:59:15.251
BY RESOLUTION ORDINANCE HAVE

00:59:15.318 --> 00:59:17.053
PROHIBITED PARKING AND HAVE

00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:21.090
AUTHORIZED THE REMOVAL OF THE

00:59:21.157 --> 00:59:22.025
VEHICLE SO.

00:59:22.091 --> 00:59:24.193
MY ORDINANCE THAT I PUT IN PLACE

00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:24.961
FOR TWENTY CAN YOU CLARIFY IS

00:59:25.028 --> 00:59:26.129
THAT STONE PLEASE ANSWER IS YES

00:59:26.195 --> 00:59:26.930
AND FIRST OF ALL LET ME

00:59:26.996 --> 00:59:28.431
APPRECIATE YOUR ENGAGEMENT WITH

00:59:28.498 --> 00:59:31.534
US ON THIS AND THERE'S NOTHING

00:59:31.601 --> 00:59:33.069
THIS BILL THAT WOULD IMPACT THE

00:59:33.136 --> 00:59:35.004
LOCAL RUBIO ORDINANCES THAT YOU

00:59:35.071 --> 00:59:37.473
HAVE PUT INTO PLACE AROUND.

00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:39.943
SENATOR RUBIO.

00:59:40.009 --> 00:59:41.110
SENATOR RICK WELL THESE ARE AND

00:59:41.177 --> 00:59:42.779
YOU WERE ON THE CITY COUNCIL I

00:59:42.845 --> 00:59:43.346
MAN THAT'S WHY REFER TO THEM

00:59:43.413 --> 00:59:44.847
THAT WAY -- THE VEHICLE CODE

00:59:44.914 --> 00:59:46.215
SECTION THAT YOU REFERENCED

00:59:46.282 --> 00:59:48.451
ALLOWS ANY CITY TO PASS ANY

00:59:48.518 --> 00:59:50.653
LOCAL RESOLUTION ORDINANCE

00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:52.188
AROUND TELLING AND LET ME.

00:59:52.255 --> 00:59:53.289
STATE SOMETHING BECAUSE I THINK

00:59:53.356 --> 00:59:55.858
IT HAS BEEN ON CLEAR WITH A LOT

00:59:55.925 --> 00:59:56.526
OF CITIES IN THEIR UNDERSTAND IN

00:59:56.592 --> 00:59:57.293
THIS BILL.

00:59:57.360 --> 01:00:00.430
THIS WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS NOT

01:00:00.496 --> 01:00:01.898
FOR A STATE TO TOWING POLICY

01:00:01.965 --> 01:00:04.267
THAT WOULD PREEMPT LOCAL LOS

01:00:04.334 --> 01:00:06.169
WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE SUGGESTING

01:00:06.235 --> 01:00:07.971
IS THAT WE DELETE.

01:00:08.037 --> 01:00:09.839
CERTAIN TOWING PROVISIONS SO

01:00:09.906 --> 01:00:12.008
THAT -- THEY'RE OFF THE BOOKS

01:00:12.075 --> 01:00:13.910
BUT BUT THIS OTHER PROVISION

01:00:13.977 --> 01:00:15.311
THAT WE JUST REFER TO WOULD

01:00:15.378 --> 01:00:17.880
ALLOW ANY CITY TO PASS ANY LOCAL

01:00:17.947 --> 01:00:19.615
TOWING ORDINANCE TO DEAL WITH

01:00:19.682 --> 01:00:21.284
ANY LOCAL CIRCUMSTANCE.

01:00:21.351 --> 01:00:24.020
YOU SEE FIT SELECT IN EXAMPLE --

01:00:24.087 --> 01:00:25.655
THE ONLY TOàN PROVISION THAT AT

01:00:25.722 --> 01:00:27.390
THIS POINT THE AMENDMENTS THAT

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:29.292
WE'VE TAKEN WOULD ALLOW TO WHICH

01:00:29.359 --> 01:00:30.927
WE'RE ASKING YOU TO SUPPORT.

01:00:30.994 --> 01:00:32.261
IS THE IDEA THAT IF YOU HAVE

01:00:32.328 --> 01:00:33.796
FIVE MORE PARKING TICKETS TOàN

01:00:33.863 --> 01:00:35.398
SHOULD NOT BE THE OPTION THAT

01:00:35.465 --> 01:00:37.066
CITIES USED TO GO OUT TO THEIR

01:00:37.133 --> 01:00:38.101
MANY OTHER.

01:00:38.167 --> 01:00:39.268
WAYS THAT YOU CAN GO AFTER

01:00:39.335 --> 01:00:40.837
PEOPLE AND I LISTED EIGHT OTHER

01:00:40.903 --> 01:00:42.672
WAYS THAT YOU CAN USE AS A CITY

01:00:42.739 --> 01:00:43.639
TO GO AFTER YOU.

01:00:43.706 --> 01:00:45.408
BUT WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS AS A

01:00:45.475 --> 01:00:47.043
STATE POLICY IT SHOULD NOT BE AN

01:00:47.110 --> 01:00:48.978
AUTOMATIC RULE BUT IF YOU'RE

01:00:49.045 --> 01:00:50.480
LOCAL CITY OF ANY OF YOUR LOCAL

01:00:50.546 --> 01:00:52.048
CITIES BELIEVE THAT SHOULD BE

01:00:52.115 --> 01:00:53.249
THE CASE.

01:00:53.316 --> 01:00:55.184
YOU COULD PASS A LOCAL LAW THAT

01:00:55.251 --> 01:00:56.753
SAYS IN THE CITY OF TAX.

01:00:56.819 --> 01:00:58.621
IF YOU HAVE FIVE OR MORE PARKING

01:00:58.688 --> 01:01:00.423
TICKETS YOUR CAR CAN BE TOWED.

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:02.458
SO THIS IS A PURE LOCAL CONTROL

01:01:02.525 --> 01:01:04.160
MEASURE -- SO THE THE LONG

01:01:04.227 --> 01:01:05.061
WINDED ANSWER YOUR QUESTION BUT

01:01:05.128 --> 01:01:06.496
YES THE RULES THAT YOU PUT IN

01:01:06.562 --> 01:01:07.697
PLACE WOULD REMAIN IN PLACE.

01:01:07.764 --> 01:01:08.865
THANK YOU SO THAT WAS A MAJOR

01:01:08.931 --> 01:01:10.233
CONCERN AGAIN COMING FROM LOCAL

01:01:10.299 --> 01:01:11.701
GOVERNMENT I WANTED TO MAKE SURE

01:01:11.768 --> 01:01:14.137
THAT ALL MY CITIES ALL MY

01:01:14.203 --> 01:01:15.271
ENFORCEMENT WHO AGAIN.

01:01:15.338 --> 01:01:16.672
I VALUE VERY DEEPLY.

01:01:16.739 --> 01:01:17.907
WOULD FEEL CONFIDENT ENOUGH THAT

01:01:17.974 --> 01:01:19.142
OUR LOCAL ORDINANCE WAS STILL BE

01:01:19.208 --> 01:01:20.810
IN PLACE AND THEY COULD STILL DO

01:01:20.877 --> 01:01:23.312
THEIR JOB -- NOW AS A LOCAL

01:01:23.379 --> 01:01:24.747
COUNCIL MEMBER I ALSO STRUGGLED

01:01:24.814 --> 01:01:26.983
VERY MUCH ON MAKING SURE THAT MY

01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:27.917
COMMITTEE WAS SAFE CLEAN

01:01:27.984 --> 01:01:34.624
AESTHETICALLY PLEASING BUT ALSO.

01:01:34.690 --> 01:01:35.625
BALANCING THE FACT THAT THERE

01:01:35.691 --> 01:01:36.926
ARE SOME PEOPLE NOW DAYS THAT

01:01:36.993 --> 01:01:37.527
ARE FALLING ON HARD TIMES AND

01:01:37.593 --> 01:01:38.528
SOMETIMES IT'S VERY DIFFICULT

01:01:38.594 --> 01:01:39.328
FOR THEM TO GET THE CARS OUT.

01:01:39.395 --> 01:01:40.463
WE DEALT WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:41.030
THAT LOST THEIR CARS DUE TO

01:01:41.097 --> 01:01:42.765
THEIR INABILITY TO TO TAKE THEIR

01:01:42.832 --> 01:01:43.900
CARS OUTSELL SO TAUGHT ALWAYS A

01:01:43.966 --> 01:01:45.501
BALANCING ACT AND SO.

01:01:45.568 --> 01:01:47.036
I DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR ONCE

01:01:47.103 --> 01:01:48.204
AGAIN SITTING DOWN WITH ME

01:01:48.271 --> 01:01:49.605
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT IT WAS A

01:01:49.672 --> 01:01:50.773
LONGER TERM.

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:52.508
AND HE WAS WILLING TO BRING IT

01:01:52.575 --> 01:01:54.277
DOWN TO FIVE DAYS AND TYPICALLY

01:01:54.343 --> 01:01:55.845
IT I CAN TELL YOU AS A LOCAL

01:01:55.912 --> 01:01:57.146
COUNCIL MEMBER IT WOULD TAKE US

01:01:57.213 --> 01:01:58.815
A COUPLE OF DAYS TO GET THE CAR

01:01:58.881 --> 01:01:59.482
ANYWAY SO WE'RE JUST MAKING IT

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:00.450
UP.

01:02:00.516 --> 01:02:01.417
PUTTING IN A PLACE MAKING SURE

01:02:01.484 --> 01:02:03.719
THAT PEOPLE HAVE A LITTLE BIT

01:02:03.786 --> 01:02:05.088
MORE TIME.

01:02:05.154 --> 01:02:06.489
TO DEAL WITH THEIR CIRCUMSTANCE

01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:07.857
WHETHER IT IS GETTING SOMEONE TO

01:02:07.924 --> 01:02:09.525
HELP THEM IN A MOVE THEIR CAR OR

I THINK THAT THIS BILL HAS BEEN

01:02:12.728 --> 01:02:15.264
SIGNIFICANT ME.

01:02:15.331 --> 01:02:17.233

I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THE

01:03:08.918 --> 01:03:10.586
CONVERSATION A LET ME SAY I KNOW --

01:03:10.653 --> 01:03:11.921
THERE IS STILL SOME OPPOSITION

01:03:11.988 --> 01:03:13.789
AND WE HAVE HAD NUMEROUS

01:03:13.856 --> 01:03:15.491
MEETINGS WITH MANY CITIES

01:03:15.558 --> 01:03:17.126
INCLUDING THE LEAGUE OF CITIES

01:03:17.193 --> 01:03:18.561
AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OTHERS.

01:03:18.628 --> 01:03:19.962
ARE TO CONTINUE TO MAKE THIS A

01:03:20.029 --> 01:03:21.397
BETTER BILL AND I'M COMMITTED TO

01:03:21.464 --> 01:03:23.466
CONTINUING TO DO THAT -- AND LET

01:03:23.533 --> 01:03:24.800
ME ALSO SAY THAT I VERY MUCH

01:03:24.867 --> 01:03:26.936
AGREE WE ALL SHARE THE GOAL OF

01:03:27.003 --> 01:03:28.371
ENSURING PUBLIC SAFETY AND

01:03:28.437 --> 01:03:30.039
ASSURING TRAFFIC FLOW SO THERE'S

01:03:30.106 --> 01:03:30.907
NOTHING.

01:03:30.973 --> 01:03:32.909
ABOUT THIS THAT IS MEANT TO

01:03:32.975 --> 01:03:35.211
IMPACT THAT -- AS I THINK YOU

01:03:35.278 --> 01:03:37.246
HEARD FROM OUR COALITION WE HAVE

01:03:37.313 --> 01:03:39.215
AMENDED THE SIGNIFICANTLY -- I

01:03:39.282 --> 01:03:40.516
WILL SHARE WITH YOU THAT WE HAD

01:03:40.583 --> 01:03:42.318
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHETHER WE

01:03:42.385 --> 01:03:44.954

01:03:45.021 --> 01:03:46.489
CONVERSATION WITHOUT MAKING

01:03:46.556 --> 01:03:47.657
AMENDMENTS BUT FROM MY

01:03:47.723 --> 01:03:49.091
PERSPECTIVE I THINK IT'S

01:03:49.158 --> 01:03:50.593
IMPORTANT FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:52.228
ON WHAT WE CAN AGREE WITH.

01:03:52.295 --> 01:03:53.196
AND I THINK THAT IS WHAT YOU

01:03:53.262 --> 01:03:54.230
HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU AND THAT'S

01:03:54.297 --> 01:03:55.398
WHAT WE ASK YOU TO DO.

01:03:55.464 --> 01:03:56.933
THE FINAL THING I WOULD SAY IS

01:03:56.999 --> 01:03:58.701
WE ALL NOW REGARDS OF WHICH SIDE

01:03:58.768 --> 01:04:00.937
OF THE AISLE WE ARE ON THAT THE

01:04:01.003 --> 01:04:02.672
BIGGEST CHALLENGES CALIFORNIA'S

01:04:02.738 --> 01:04:04.073

IT'S AROUND HOMELESSNESS IT'S

01:04:06.742 --> 01:04:08.010
RUN STRUGGLES INVOLVING PEOPLE

01:04:08.077 --> 01:04:11.347
WHO ARE POOR.

01:04:11.414 --> 01:04:12.682

SIGNIFICANTLY AMENDED THIS WE DO

01:04:13.416 --> 01:04:14.150
THINK THAT THESE ARE PROVISIONS

01:04:14.217 --> 01:04:15.251
THAT WILL HELP IMPACT THAT

01:04:15.318 --> 01:04:17.253
WITHOUT IMPACTING PUBLIC SAFETY

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:19.455

HAVE A SAFE PLACE TO PARK.

01:05:14.543 --> 01:05:16.178

FIND A PLACE FOR THEM TO PARK.

01:05:22.918 --> 01:05:24.820
AND THAT INCLUDES A LOCATION

MORE CHARGING STATIONS OUT THERE.

01:18:42.217 --> 01:18:43.485
WHAT IT ALSO DOES IS IT

01:18:43.552 --> 01:18:46.154
INCREASES THE COST OF THE --

01:18:46.221 --> 01:18:47.489
CHARGING STE CHARGING STATION TO

01:18:47.556 --> 01:18:49.124
AN EXTENT FOR IT MIGHT BECOME

01:18:49.191 --> 01:18:51.793
UNAFFORDABLE FOR A SITE HOSTED A

01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:54.162

01:18:59.134 --> 01:19:00.435
LEAD TO TO CONSEQUENCES ONE OF

OF THE CHARGING.

01:19:08.844 --> 01:19:09.945
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THIS IS A

01:19:10.011 --> 01:19:11.246
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE

INCOME POPULATIONS.

01:19:16.151 --> 01:19:17.452
AND COULD LEAD DOWN TO SHUT

DOWNS AND DISADVANTAGED

01:19:18.286 --> 01:19:20.055

01:19:22.157 --> 01:19:23.125

01:19:23.191 --> 01:19:24.759
AND THESE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE

01:19:24.826 --> 01:19:27.195
LIKELY TO BE IMPACTED THE MOST.

01:19:27.262 --> 01:19:27.896
THERE ARE BETTER WAYS TO DO

01:19:27.963 --> 01:19:30.132
BUSINESS THERE ARE BETTER WAYS

STATIONS OUT THERE AND THAT IS

01:19:33.268 --> 01:19:35.470
WHY WE'VE BEEN OF OPEN TO MOST

01:19:35.537 --> 01:19:36.838
OF THE SUGGESTIONS IN THE BILL

01:19:36.905 --> 01:19:37.772

01:19:48.316 --> 01:19:50.919
OF PAYMENT.

01:19:50.986 --> 01:19:52.587
ALSO -- SINCE CARD READERS ARE
