THE DRUG THAT WHEN ADMINISTERED.

01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:46.988
DURING AN OVERDOSE WILL REVERSE

01:18:47.055 --> 01:18:49.191
THE OVERDOSE. IT'S BASICALLY

01:18:49.257 --> 01:18:50.459

THE OVERDOSES ARE THE OVERDOSE

01:19:37.772 --> 01:19:40.041
DEATHS THAT WERE AVERTED.

01:19:40.108 --> 01:19:41.877
BECAUSE OF SYRINGE PROGRAMMING.

01:19:41.943 --> 01:19:43.111
THE GROWTH IN DEMAND FOR

01:19:43.178 --> 01:19:44.579
STERILE SYRINGES IS ALSO THE

01:19:44.646 --> 01:19:46.248
MAIN DRIVER IN THE UPTAKE FOR

01:19:46.314 --> 01:19:48.617

THAT WE ONLY HAVE FIFTEEN

01:39:15.616 --> 01:39:17.418
HUGE ISSUES IN OUR COMMUNITY.

01:39:17.484 --> 01:39:18.686
AND A LOT OF THE TIME THE ROOT

01:39:18.752 --> 01:39:21.388
CAUSES ARE VERY APPARENT AND AS

01:39:21.455 --> 01:39:22.423
MANY PEOPLE AS THAT THE DAY

01:39:22.489 --> 01:39:24.692

SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH.

01:39:26.694 --> 01:39:28.062
SO A LACK OF RESOURCES LIKE

01:39:28.128 --> 01:39:31.298
HOUSING EMPLOYMENT I'M ANOTHER

01:39:31.365 --> 01:39:33.634
THESE THINGS THAT- CREATE

01:39:33.701 --> 01:39:35.803
BARRIERS TO FOLKS GETTING

01:39:35.869 --> 01:39:37.604
FINANCIAL STABILITY. AND

01:39:37.671 --> 01:39:40.040
REACHING A LEVEL OF STABILITY

01:39:40.107 --> 01:39:41.575
JUST IN GENERAL- LEADS TO

01:39:41.642 --> 01:39:43.444
THINGS LIKE DRUG GROUP DRUG USE

01:39:43.510 --> 01:39:45.212
RISKY SEXUAL BEHAVIOR FOLKS

01:39:45.279 --> 01:39:46.980
BEING PUT IN POSITIONS. WHERE

01:39:47.047 --> 01:39:48.682
MAYBE. WE'RE NOT MAKING THE

01:39:48.749 --> 01:39:50.150
SMARTEST DECISIONS WHEN IT

01:39:50.217 --> 01:39:52.853
COMES TO OUR SEXUAL HEALTH- AND

01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:53.487
A LOT OF THE TIME THAT LEADS TO

01:39:53.554 --> 01:39:56.357
US CONTRACTING A LOT OF THINGS

01:39:56.423 --> 01:39:58.158
THAT WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY.

01:39:58.225 --> 01:40:01.862
SEOUL CONDOMS AND LOW LEVEL

01:40:01.929 --> 01:40:03.263
OUTREACH PROGRAMS WHICH A LOT

01:40:03.330 --> 01:40:04.932
OF THE TIME OR WHAT'S AVAILABLE

01:40:04.998 --> 01:40:06.834
TO TRANS FOLKS THOSE THINGS

01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:08.402
AREN'T SAVING OUR LIVES BUT

01:40:08.469 --> 01:40:10.270
IT'S WHAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE AND

01:40:10.337 --> 01:40:12.172
SO THEY'RE HELPING BUT THEY'RE

01:40:12.239 --> 01:40:13.907
NOT NECESSARILY ADDRESSING THE

01:40:13.974 --> 01:40:15.075
ROOT CAUSES LIKE I MENTIONED

01:40:15.142 --> 01:40:16.877
EARLIER THINGS LIKE HOUSING

01:40:16.944 --> 01:40:18.712

CULTURAL TRANSFORMATION WELL

01:40:28.989 --> 01:40:30.023
BUT THEIR EARLY EFFORTS AND

01:40:30.090 --> 01:40:31.358
INITIATIVES ADDRESSING THOSE

01:40:31.425 --> 01:40:32.726
THINGS THAT I JUST MENTIONED

01:40:32.793 --> 01:40:35.529
HAVING TRANSPOSES ABOUT CONDOMS

01:40:35.596 --> 01:40:36.930
LEAVING THEM WITH CRAP BUT

01:40:36.997 --> 01:40:38.899
THEY'RE STILL HOMELESS SAID AS

01:40:38.966 --> 01:40:41.034
WELL AS TRANSPHOBIC THIS IS WHY

01:40:41.101 --> 01:40:43.337
S. TRANSOXANIA AT THE HANDS OF

01:40:43.404 --> 01:40:45.439
THE SYSTEM WHERE WE'RE TAKING

01:40:45.506 --> 01:40:46.974
BACK OUR POWER AND TRANSIT THE

01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:48.809
A COALITION AND ANNA QUESTION

01:40:48.876 --> 01:40:52.413
OF TRANSIT INNOVATIONS ACOSTA

01:40:52.479 --> 01:40:53.947
THEY ARE REALLY. TRYING TO

01:40:54.014 --> 01:40:54.548
DEMAND THE REASON IS THE WE

01:40:54.615 --> 01:40:55.616
HAVE STE HEAD START DESERVE

01:40:55.682 --> 01:40:58.385
FROM THE STAY AND SOCIETY. AND

01:40:58.452 --> 01:41:00.320
SO WE'VE CREATED A STATEWIDE

01:41:00.387 --> 01:41:02.322
BUDGET PROPOSAL ON FOR THE

01:41:02.389 --> 01:41:03.690
CREATION OF THE TRANSGENDER

01:41:03.757 --> 01:41:05.359
WELLNESS IN EQUITY FUND ACROSS

01:41:05.426 --> 01:41:06.360
SEVERAL DIFFERENT STATE

01:41:06.427 --> 01:41:08.762
DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES- WHICH

01:41:08.829 --> 01:41:11.131
WOULD CREATE THIS FIND IN FIVE

01:41:11.198 --> 01:41:12.499
DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS WHICH HAD

01:41:12.566 --> 01:41:15.369
FUN THINGS LIKE- NEEDS

01:41:15.436 --> 01:41:18.372
ASSESSMENTS DATA COLLECTION AND

01:41:18.439 --> 01:41:18.872
CULTURAL TRANSFORMATION

01:41:18.939 --> 01:41:20.741
CHANNING'S. IT WOULD FIND IN

01:41:20.808 --> 01:41:22.342
INVESTMENT IN MEDICAL OR MENTAL

01:41:22.409 --> 01:41:23.677
HEALTH BUT ADEQUATE FOR OUR

01:41:23.744 --> 01:41:26.013
PEOPLE PATHWAYS TO EMPLOYMENT

01:41:26.079 --> 01:41:27.281
AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE LABOR

01:41:27.347 --> 01:41:28.148
LAWS THAT WE DO HAVE IN

01:41:28.215 --> 01:41:29.716
CALIFORNIA THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE

01:41:29.783 --> 01:41:30.884
LIKE ACTUALLY REALLY STRONG

01:41:30.951 --> 01:41:32.319
PROTECTIONS FOR TRANS FOLKS IN

01:41:32.386 --> 01:41:33.487
CALIFORNIA BUT NONE OF THAT IS

01:41:33.554 --> 01:41:34.822
ACTUALLY BEING RESPECTED AND

01:41:34.888 --> 01:41:37.157
IMPLEMENTATION. FAIR INCLUSIVE

01:41:37.224 --> 01:41:39.026
UNSTABLE HOUSING AND THEN A

01:41:39.092 --> 01:41:42.129
BIG. GAP IN A BIG POPULATION OF

01:41:42.196 --> 01:41:43.363
OUR FOLKS THAT ARE OFTEN

01:41:43.430 --> 01:41:44.898
FORGOTTEN- FOLKS THAT ARE

01:41:44.965 --> 01:41:45.933
COMING OUT OF PRISON AND PEOPLE

01:41:45.999 --> 01:41:47.768
THAT ARE COMING OUT OF

01:41:47.835 --> 01:41:49.369
IMMIGRATION INTENTION. AND SO

01:41:49.436 --> 01:41:50.437
IT'S CHANGES INVESTMENTS LIKE

01:41:50.504 --> 01:41:51.405
THESE THAT WILL REALLY LIKE

01:41:51.472 --> 01:41:53.073
ADDRESS A LOT OF THE ROOT

01:41:53.140 --> 01:41:54.274
CAUSES THAT ARE CAUSING US TO

01:41:54.341 --> 01:41:56.109
CONTRACT. I'M A LOT OF THINGS

01:41:56.176 --> 01:41:57.811
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY.

01:41:57.878 --> 01:41:59.046
AND SO WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK

01:41:59.112 --> 01:42:00.881
INTO THE SPECIFIC AND HOLISTIC

01:42:00.948 --> 01:42:03.450

BARRIERS TO CARE. AND SO

01:42:17.531 --> 01:42:19.533
FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE ALWAYS

01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:20.834
ACKNOWLEDGE TRANS FOLKS IN THE

01:42:20.901 --> 01:42:21.835
ROOM WITH SEXUAL HEALTH AND

01:42:21.902 --> 01:42:23.704
KNOW THE PROBLEMS BUT RATHER

01:42:23.770 --> 01:42:25.205

FOLKS GET OFF THE STREETS AND-

01:42:32.613 --> 01:42:33.847

01:44:23.357 --> 01:44:23.890
THAT CAN BE CURED WITH

01:44:23.957 --> 01:44:26.393
ANTIBIOTICS- IT IS THE MOST

01:44:26.460 --> 01:44:27.995
COMMON CAUSE OF STILL WORK

01:44:28.061 --> 01:44:29.730
AFTER TWENTY WEEKS GESTATION.

ANTIBIOTICS IN A TIMELY MANNER-

01:44:45.646 --> 01:44:47.214
AND SO AS ACT DURING MOST

01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:48.782
MENTIONED EARLIER IN THE STATE

01:44:48.849 --> 01:44:50.550
OF CALIFORNIA IN TWO THOUSAND.

01:44:50.617 --> 01:44:52.519
AND EIGHTEEN THERE WERE THREE

01:44:52.586 --> 01:44:54.221
HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE INFANTS

01:44:54.287 --> 01:44:55.022

SYPHILIS. AND THE PRELIMINARY

01:44:56.723 --> 01:44:59.059
DATA FROM TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN

01:44:59.126 --> 01:45:01.728
IS NOT PROMISING- IT IS. VERY

01:45:01.795 --> 01:45:02.629
LIKELY TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY

01:45:02.696 --> 01:45:04.531
HIGHER- SO WE ARE VERY

01:45:04.598 --> 01:45:06.166
CONCERNED BY THE- AMOUNT OF

01:45:06.233 --> 01:45:07.167
CONTENT ALL SUPPOSE WE ARE

01:45:07.234 --> 01:45:07.901
SEEING IN THE STATE OF

01:45:07.968 --> 01:45:10.103
CALIFORNIA. IN TWO THOUSAND

01:45:10.170 --> 01:45:11.672
EIGHTEEN. CALIFORNIA BE WAS

01:45:11.738 --> 01:45:15.609
ACCOUNTED 425% OF ALL THE CAN

01:45:15.676 --> 01:45:16.176
DENTAL SUPPLIES CASES IN THE

01:45:16.243 --> 01:45:19.312
NATION. I IN CURRENT IN MY

01:45:19.379 --> 01:45:21.381
COMMUNITY HISTORICALLY GENTLE

01:45:21.448 --> 01:45:23.250
SYPHILIS CASES WERE IDENTIFIED

01:45:23.316 --> 01:45:24.818
EVERY COUPLE OF YEARS THERE ARE

01:45:24.885 --> 01:45:26.119
MANY YEARS IN THE PAST TWENTY

01:45:26.186 --> 01:45:27.354
YEARS WE HAD NO CASES OF

01:45:27.421 --> 01:45:30.557
CONGENITAL SYPHILIS AND THEN IN

01:45:30.624 --> 01:45:31.758
TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE THERE

01:45:31.825 --> 01:45:32.993
ARE FOUR CASES I'M AN

01:45:33.060 --> 01:45:34.428
EPIDEMIOLOGIST BY TRAINING THAT

01:45:34.494 --> 01:45:36.363
TIME. RUNNING AS TO THE NUMBERS

01:45:36.430 --> 01:45:37.431
AND WE LOOKED AT THAT AND WE

01:45:37.497 --> 01:45:39.733
SAID HEY WE'VE NEVER SEEN FOUR

01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:40.934
CASES OF MALE CIRCLES IN A

01:45:41.001 --> 01:45:42.569
SINGLE YEAR. BUT WE THOUGHT

01:45:42.636 --> 01:45:43.870
WELL MAYBE THIS IS JUST ONE OF

01:45:43.937 --> 01:45:44.638
THOSE ANOMALIES WERE IT JUST

01:45:44.705 --> 01:45:46.940
HAPPENS AN ACTUAL BACK TO ZERO

01:45:47.007 --> 01:45:48.809
OR MAYBE ONE- UNFORTUNATELY

01:45:48.875 --> 01:45:50.577
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN IN TWO

01:45:50.644 --> 01:45:51.178
THOUSAND THIRTEEN WITH ANOTHER

01:45:51.244 --> 01:45:52.612
FOR. AND WE SAT AROUND THE

01:45:52.679 --> 01:45:53.914
TABLE AGAIN WE SAID HEY WE'VE

01:45:53.980 --> 01:45:55.115
NEVER HAD TWO YEARS IN A ROW

01:45:55.182 --> 01:45:56.883
WITH FOUR CASES EACH. BUT WE

01:45:56.950 --> 01:45:58.385
SAID WELL LAST YEAR WAS FOUR

01:45:58.452 --> 01:46:00.253
CASES THIS YEAR'S FOUR CASES

01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:01.354
MAYBE THIS IS THE NEW NORMAL

01:46:01.421 --> 01:46:02.856
THAT WE'RE SEEING. AND THEN WE

01:46:02.923 --> 01:46:04.658
HIT TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN

01:46:04.725 --> 01:46:05.826
WE HAD EIGHTEEN. AND AT THAT

01:46:05.892 --> 01:46:07.094
TIME WE SAID UNTIL WE SAID.

01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:10.163
WE'RE IN TROUBLE- YOU KNOW WE-

01:46:10.230 --> 01:46:11.198
AT THAT POINT WE KNEW WE HAD A

01:46:11.264 --> 01:46:12.599
PROBLEM. AND THAT WE HAD TO

01:46:12.666 --> 01:46:14.334
WORK VERY QUICKLY TO TRY TO

01:46:14.401 --> 01:46:16.970
ADDRESS IT. THE FOLLOWING YEAR

01:46:17.037 --> 01:46:19.706
IS IDENTIFIED TWENTY SEVEN

01:46:19.773 --> 01:46:20.440
THIRTY THREE AND FIFTY SIX

01:46:20.507 --> 01:46:23.043
CASES- KERN COUNTY HAS THE

01:46:23.110 --> 01:46:24.077
UNFORTUNATE DISTINCTION OF

01:46:24.144 --> 01:46:25.412
HAVING ONE OF THE HIGHEST RATES

01:46:25.479 --> 01:46:27.013
OF CATTLE SURPLUS. OF FRESNO IS

01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:29.182
ANOTHER ONE AND- JAIL SURPLUS

01:46:29.249 --> 01:46:30.383
IN PARTICULAR HAS IMPACTED THE

01:46:30.450 --> 01:46:33.653
CENTRAL VALLEY- MORE THAN.

01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:36.189
OTHER COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA.

01:46:36.256 --> 01:46:37.624
I'M OFTEN ASKED AS AN

01:46:37.691 --> 01:46:38.391
EPIDEMIOLOGIST WILL WHAT

01:46:38.458 --> 01:46:40.193
HAPPENED WHAT BECAUSE CAN

01:46:40.260 --> 01:46:41.094
DENTAL SUPPOSED TO GO FROM

01:46:41.161 --> 01:46:44.765
ALMOST NOTHING- YOU KNOW TO.

01:46:44.831 --> 01:46:46.433
109% HIGHER THAN IT WAS BEFORE

01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:47.367
AND THE INTELLECTUAL REALLY

01:46:47.434 --> 01:46:49.936
SIMPLE. IF YOU LOOK AT RATES OF

01:46:50.003 --> 01:46:51.671
THE FOURTH AMONG WOMEN THEY

01:46:51.738 --> 01:46:52.639
STARTED GOING UP RUN TWO

01:46:52.706 --> 01:46:54.474
THOUSAND ELEVEN. AND AS THOSE

01:46:54.541 --> 01:46:56.810
RATES- SKYROCKETED WE SELL

01:46:56.877 --> 01:46:58.845
CONTENT ALSO FELIZ POP UP- SO

01:46:58.912 --> 01:47:01.214
IT'S A VERY SIMPLE ANSWER- TO

01:47:01.281 --> 01:47:02.716
VERY COMPLICATED QUESTION IS

01:47:02.783 --> 01:47:04.484
THAT AS LONG AS THERE ARE.

01:47:04.551 --> 01:47:05.819
WOMEN WITH THE FULLEST THEY

01:47:05.886 --> 01:47:07.287
WILL BE BABIES WITH SYPHILIS

01:47:07.354 --> 01:47:08.455
AND AS THAT ROUTE RATE

01:47:08.522 --> 01:47:09.723
CONTINUES TO INCREASE ACROSS

01:47:09.790 --> 01:47:11.458
THE CITY CALIFORNIA WE EXPECT

01:47:11.525 --> 01:47:13.260
TO SEE MORE BABIES BORN WITH

01:47:13.326 --> 01:47:15.362
CONGENITAL SYPHILIS. THEN KERN

01:47:15.428 --> 01:47:17.731
COUNTY- WE'VE IDENTIFIED A

01:47:17.798 --> 01:47:19.065
NUMBER OF THINGS AMONG WOMEN

01:47:19.132 --> 01:47:20.634
WHO HAVE GIVEN BIRTH TO INFANTS

01:47:20.700 --> 01:47:22.202
DIAGNOSED WITH MENTAL SYPHILIS.

01:47:22.269 --> 01:47:24.237
MEDI CAL IS A PAIR OF NEARLY

01:47:24.304 --> 01:47:25.772
ALL OF THE THIS IS. ALL THE

01:47:25.839 --> 01:47:27.407
DELIVERIES IN KERN COUNTY. AND

01:47:27.474 --> 01:47:28.975
WITH THAT WE EXPECTED THAT

01:47:29.042 --> 01:47:30.844
MEDIC HOW WILL BE THE PAYER FOR

01:47:30.911 --> 01:47:32.345
ANY OF THE ASSOCIATED

01:47:32.412 --> 01:47:32.846
COMPLICATIONS THAT THESE

01:47:32.913 --> 01:47:34.614
INFANTS FACE. THE VAST MAJORITY

01:47:34.681 --> 01:47:36.416
OF MOTHER SHOW NO SIGNS OF

01:47:36.483 --> 01:47:37.984
SURPLUS AT DELIVERY AND MANY OF

01:47:38.051 --> 01:47:39.419
THEM DON'T KNOW THAT THEY WERE

01:47:39.486 --> 01:47:40.654
INFECTED AT SOME POINT IN THEIR

01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:41.988
LIVES. AND THAT THAT INFECTION

01:47:42.055 --> 01:47:44.424
FROM YEARS AGO COULD AFFECT

01:47:44.491 --> 01:47:46.593
THEIR PREGNANCY AND THEIR BABY.

01:47:46.660 --> 01:47:47.694
MANY OF THE MOTHERS ARE

01:47:47.761 --> 01:47:48.695
ENTERING INTO PRENATAL CARE

01:47:48.762 --> 01:47:50.564
EITHER LATE IN THEIR IN THEIR

01:47:50.630 --> 01:47:52.499
PREGNANCY OR NOT AT ALL WE HAVE

01:47:52.566 --> 01:47:53.633
A NUMBER OF WOMEN WHO SHOW UP

01:47:53.700 --> 01:47:55.402
AT THE HOSPITAL. AND DELIVER

01:47:55.468 --> 01:47:57.704
WITH NO PRENATAL CARE. FANCIFUL

01:47:57.771 --> 01:47:59.306
IS SOMETHING THAT IS REQUIRED

01:47:59.372 --> 01:48:00.707
BY LAW TO BE TESTED AT YOUR

01:48:00.774 --> 01:48:01.908
FIRST PRENATAL VISIT AND SO WE

01:48:01.975 --> 01:48:03.577
KNOW A LOT OF THESE MOTHERS. IF

01:48:03.643 --> 01:48:04.511
THEY WOULD ENTER INTO PRENATAL

01:48:04.578 --> 01:48:06.546
CARE EARLIER WOULD BE TESTED

01:48:06.613 --> 01:48:07.514
AND HOPEFULLY HAVE TIME TO BE

01:48:07.581 --> 01:48:10.183
TREATED BEFORE- THIS INFECTION

01:48:10.250 --> 01:48:12.686
AFFECT AFFECTED THEIR BABY. A

01:48:12.752 --> 01:48:14.120
LARGE PROPORTION OF MOTHERS

01:48:14.187 --> 01:48:15.722
HAVE A HISTORY OF DRUG USE-

01:48:15.789 --> 01:48:16.890
MANY OF THEM ARE CURRENT DRUG

01:48:16.957 --> 01:48:18.992
USERS WHEN THEY DELIVER. MORE

01:48:19.059 --> 01:48:19.693
AND MORE OF THEM ARE BEING

01:48:19.759 --> 01:48:21.928
AFFECTED BY HOMELESSNESS. AND A

01:48:21.995 --> 01:48:22.762
LOT OF THESE INFANTS ARE ENDING

01:48:22.829 --> 01:48:24.197
UP IN FOSTER CARE. THAT'S WHAT

01:48:24.264 --> 01:48:27.434
WE SEE JUSTIN KERN COUNTY- AND

01:48:27.500 --> 01:48:28.001
I IMAGINE IT'S VERY SIMILAR

01:48:28.068 --> 01:48:30.070
ACROSS THE STATE. IN CURRENT

01:48:30.136 --> 01:48:31.338
COUNTY WE HAVE BEEN DEDICATING

01:48:31.404 --> 01:48:32.505
RESOURCES SPECIFICALLY.

01:48:32.572 --> 01:48:33.840
SPECIFICALLY TO SUPPOSING

01:48:33.907 --> 01:48:35.342
DENTAL SUPPLIES FOR THE BETTER

01:48:35.408 --> 01:48:37.611
PART OF FOUR YEARS I HAD THE

01:48:37.677 --> 01:48:38.445
PRIVILEGE OF WORKING WITH

01:48:38.511 --> 01:48:39.546
INCREDIBLE PEOPLE WHO GO ABOVE

AND BEYOND TO SUPPORT PREGNANT

01:48:41.381 --> 01:48:43.383
WOMEN. AND THEIR BABIES. IN A

01:48:43.450 --> 01:48:44.017
TIME WHEN MANY HEALTH

01:48:44.084 --> 01:48:45.051
DEPARTMENTS HAVE BEEN FORCED TO

01:48:45.118 --> 01:48:46.386
CLOSE THEIR CLINICS ARE

01:48:46.453 --> 01:48:48.355
CLINICIANS. WILL DO ALMOST

01:48:48.421 --> 01:48:49.289
ANYTHING TO MAKE SURE THAT A

01:48:49.356 --> 01:48:50.523
PREGNANT WOMAN WITH THE FELIZ

LUNCH THEY STAY LATE- THEY WORK

01:48:54.995 --> 01:48:56.563
EXTRA HARD BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT

01:48:56.630 --> 01:48:58.732
THESE WOMEN- WHEN THEY PRESENT

01:48:58.798 --> 01:49:00.734
TO US NEED TO BE SEEN NOW

01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:03.036
BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT COME BACK

I ALSO WORK WITH. AN AMAZING

01:49:04.771 --> 01:49:06.006
TEAM OF MEDICAL INVESTIGATORS

THEY'VE BEEN GOING AND I'VE

01:55:06.266 --> 01:55:07.734
BEEN JOTTING DOWN THINGS AND

01:55:07.800 --> 01:55:09.235
KIND OF RE SHUFFLING WHAT I

01:55:09.302 --> 01:55:10.637
WANNA SAY WHICH MAY BE A LITTLE

01:55:10.703 --> 01:55:12.205
DANGEROUS AN ACADEMIC OFF

01:55:12.272 --> 01:55:15.275
SCRIPT BUT- BUT- IN LISTENING

01:55:15.341 --> 01:55:16.809
TO HURT TO THE CONVERSATION AS

IT'S GONE THUS FAR THIS

01:55:18.344 --> 01:55:20.313
AFTERNOON- I THINK THERE'S

01:55:20.380 --> 01:55:22.882
REALLY. TO KIND OF COMPETING

01:55:22.949 --> 01:55:26.552
FORCES THAT SHAPE. WE HAVE TO

01:55:26.619 --> 01:55:27.220
THINK ABOUT WHEN WE'RE THINKING

01:55:27.287 --> 01:55:29.455
ABOUT STRATEGIES TO RESPOND TO

01:55:29.522 --> 01:55:31.858
ENDING THESE EPIDEMICS- ONE OF

01:55:31.924 --> 01:55:33.826
THEM THAT IS DEFINITELY. BEEN

01:55:33.893 --> 01:55:34.827
PREVALENT IN MANY OF THE

01:55:34.894 --> 01:55:37.463
CONVERSATIONS IS THIS ISSUE OF

01:55:37.530 --> 01:55:39.632
LAYERS OF VULNERABILITY. RIGHT

01:55:39.699 --> 01:55:40.700
I MEAN YOU CAN THINK OF THEM AS

01:55:40.767 --> 01:55:42.368
A VENN DIAGRAM OF OVERLAPPING

01:55:42.435 --> 01:55:46.839
CIRCLES- BUT- WE AS A GENERAL

01:55:46.906 --> 01:55:48.875
RULE WHEN YOU LOOK ACROSS THE

01:55:48.941 --> 01:55:49.976
DIFFERENT CONDITIONS AND YOU

01:55:50.043 --> 01:55:52.145
LOOK ACROSS WHAT DISPARITIES

01:55:52.211 --> 01:55:53.913
LOOK LIKE YOU TRY TO SAY. THE

01:55:53.980 --> 01:55:55.481
WHAT'S THE PATTERN AND HOW DO

01:55:55.548 --> 01:55:57.750
WE EXPLAIN THE PATTERN. BUT WE

01:55:57.817 --> 01:56:00.086
GENERALLY DO BETTER. WHEN WE

01:56:00.153 --> 01:56:01.487
ARE TRYING TO HELP SOMEBODY WHO

01:56:01.554 --> 01:56:02.689
HAS FEWER LAYERS OF

01:56:02.755 --> 01:56:04.757
VULNERABILITY SO IF YOU'RE ONLY

01:56:04.824 --> 01:56:06.626
ISSUE. IS THAT YOU ARE AT RISK

01:56:06.693 --> 01:56:08.695
FOR HIV AND YOU REALLY DON'T

01:56:08.761 --> 01:56:10.863
HAVE OTHER BIG ISSUES THAT YOU

01:56:10.930 --> 01:56:12.799
HAVE TO DEAL WITH. WE'RE NOT

01:56:12.865 --> 01:56:15.601
PERFECT AT IT BUT WE DO OKAY AT

01:56:15.668 --> 01:56:17.270
HELPING THAT PERSON TO REDUCE

01:56:17.337 --> 01:56:20.206
RISK BUT IF THAT IF THAT SAME

01:56:20.273 --> 01:56:22.308
PERSON NOT ONLY IS AT RISK FOR

01:56:22.375 --> 01:56:25.011
HIV BUT IS ALSO AT RISK FOR HCV

01:56:25.078 --> 01:56:27.580
AN S. T. D.'S XANDER HOMELESS.

01:56:27.647 --> 01:56:28.681
AND THEY MIGHT HAVE A MENTAL

01:56:28.748 --> 01:56:30.616
HEALTH CONDITION AND THEY DON'T

01:56:30.683 --> 01:56:31.551
KNOW WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO GET

01:56:31.617 --> 01:56:34.187
THEIR NEXT MEAL. AND YOU KNOW

01:56:34.253 --> 01:56:36.255
THEY HAD ABUSE OR THINGS LIKE

01:56:36.322 --> 01:56:39.492
THAT WE- ARE FAR LESS LIKELY TO

01:56:39.559 --> 01:56:41.861
BE SUCCESSFUL. RIGHT AND THAT'S

01:56:41.928 --> 01:56:42.729
JUST BECAUSE YOU DO HAVE THIS

01:56:42.795 --> 01:56:44.764
HIERARCHY OF NEEDS IN THIS KIND

01:56:44.831 --> 01:56:47.667
OF THE LAYER. OF ISSUES THAT

01:56:47.734 --> 01:56:50.103
THE PERSON HAS TO DEAL WITH.

01:56:50.169 --> 01:56:51.604
THEM AND THE IMPLICATIONS OF

01:56:51.671 --> 01:56:53.072
THAT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT A

01:56:53.139 --> 01:56:55.875
RESPONSE. IS THAT YOU HAVE TO

01:56:55.942 --> 01:56:57.744
BREAK DOWN AND SORT OF CUT

01:56:57.810 --> 01:57:00.513
ACROSS HAVE BEEN VERY TO. IN

01:57:00.580 --> 01:57:02.782
TERMS OF THE WAY THAT WE STEP

01:57:02.849 --> 01:57:04.450
UP OUR SYSTEM IS IN THE WAY

01:57:04.517 --> 01:57:07.620
THAT IT'S SET UP SERVICE. RIGHT

01:57:07.687 --> 01:57:10.323
SO THERE'S DIVISIONS BY DISEASE.

01:57:10.390 --> 01:57:12.592
RIGHT AND PART OF WHAT BROUGHT

01:57:12.658 --> 01:57:14.260
US HERE TODAY IS THIS IDEA THAT.

01:57:14.327 --> 01:57:16.329
WE WOULD DO BETTER NOT TO JUST

01:57:16.396 --> 01:57:17.430
THINK OF HIV AS H. A. B.

01:57:17.497 --> 01:57:19.365
SERVICES AN H. C. B. OVER HERE

01:57:19.432 --> 01:57:21.467
AND STDS OVER HERE. BUT TO

01:57:21.534 --> 01:57:22.201
BRING THEM TOGETHER AND THINK

01:57:22.268 --> 01:57:25.271
ABOUT AND- PLAN. BUT WE ALSO

01:57:25.338 --> 01:57:29.876
HAVE TO. A HEALTH SERVE. AND

01:57:29.942 --> 01:57:30.443
THEN THINGS ARE NOT TREATED

01:57:30.510 --> 01:57:33.079
HELD SERVICE SO HOMELESSNESS.

01:57:33.146 --> 01:57:36.182
IS A HUGE VULNERABILITY IT'S-

01:57:36.249 --> 01:57:38.584
VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND SAN

01:57:38.651 --> 01:57:39.752
FRANCISCO FOR EXAMPLE WHERE I

01:57:39.819 --> 01:57:41.687
COME FROM RIGHT I MEAN. WE HAVE

01:57:41.754 --> 01:57:43.256
ALL THE SUCCESSES SAN FRANCISCO

01:57:43.322 --> 01:57:45.258
GETS HERALDED FOR IT'S GETTING

01:57:45.324 --> 01:57:46.893
TWO ZERO PLAN AND IT'S ONE

01:57:46.959 --> 01:57:48.060
HUNDRED AND NINETY SEVEN NEW

01:57:48.127 --> 01:57:49.429
INFECTIONS WHATEVER ELSE AND

01:57:49.495 --> 01:57:50.263
THEN YOU FLIP THROUGH THE

01:57:50.329 --> 01:57:52.465
ANNUAL. EPIDEMIOLOGY REPORT AND

01:57:52.532 --> 01:57:54.100
YOU LOOK AT THE STATISTICS FOR

01:57:54.167 --> 01:57:56.269
HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS. AND IT'S

01:57:56.335 --> 01:57:58.438
A FAR LESS ROSY PICTURE I MEAN

01:57:58.504 --> 01:57:59.972
IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE BLEAK IN

01:58:00.039 --> 01:58:02.108
TERMS OF HOW WELL WE'RE DOING.

01:58:02.175 --> 01:58:05.011
SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SOLVE.

01:58:05.077 --> 01:58:07.513
THE PROBLEM. OF YOU KNOW A

01:58:07.580 --> 01:58:09.382
PERSON WHO'S HOMELESS IT IS IN

01:58:09.449 --> 01:58:10.283
IN CARE YOU'RE NOT GONNA

01:58:10.349 --> 01:58:11.951
STRICTLY SOLVE THE PROBLEM BY

01:58:12.018 --> 01:58:13.052
THINKING WELL WE'LL JUS HAVE

01:58:13.119 --> 01:58:15.188
MORE CARE. WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH

01:58:15.254 --> 01:58:16.255
THE ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS WHICH

01:58:16.322 --> 01:58:18.458
IS NOT. IN THE REALM OF HEALTH

01:58:18.524 --> 01:58:19.992
CARE SERVICES WE TRADITIONALLY

01:58:20.059 --> 01:58:21.994
DEAL WITH THAT. SO WE HAVE TO

01:58:22.061 --> 01:58:23.729
THINK ABOUT HOW WE CUT ACROSS

01:58:23.796 --> 01:58:25.698
THOSE DIVISIONS AND- AND YOU

01:58:25.765 --> 01:58:27.900
KNOW AS AS STAKEHOLDERS WHO

01:58:27.967 --> 01:58:29.969
RECEIVE MONEY OF COURSE. WE CAN

01:58:30.036 --> 01:58:31.537
TRY TO DO THAT BUT SOME OF THE

01:58:31.604 --> 01:58:33.206
BARRIERS ALSO COME FROM FUNDING

01:58:33.272 --> 01:58:35.208
STREAMS AND FROM THE WAY THAT.

01:58:35.274 --> 01:58:36.809
THE PEOPLE IN YOUR POSITIONS

01:58:36.876 --> 01:58:38.945
RIGHT. LONG SET THINGS UP FOR

01:58:39.011 --> 01:58:40.279
VERY GOOD REASONS THE WAY WE

01:58:40.346 --> 01:58:42.348
STRUCTURE TO THINGS- FROM LONG

01:58:42.415 --> 01:58:43.683
AGO IN TERMS OF HOW WE THINK

01:58:43.749 --> 01:58:45.852
ABOUT. WHO'S RESPONSIBLE ONE

01:58:45.918 --> 01:58:47.753
WHAT SELECT COMMITTEE WHAT WHAT

01:58:47.820 --> 01:58:49.489
WHAT FUNDING STREAM WHAT PART

01:58:49.555 --> 01:58:50.790
OF THE BUDGET TO SOMETHING COME

01:58:50.857 --> 01:58:51.924
THROUGH THESE ARE THESE ARE

01:58:51.991 --> 01:58:53.593
ISSUES WE HAVE TO TACKLE TO TRY

01:58:53.659 --> 01:58:56.829
TO. TO BREAK DOWN THOSE

01:58:56.896 --> 01:58:59.065
BARRIERS. THE COMPETING FOR THE

01:58:59.131 --> 01:59:00.132
IS ALSO GOING WE'RE TALKING

01:59:00.199 --> 01:59:01.467
ABOUT LAYERS OF OWNER BILLY

01:59:01.534 --> 01:59:02.702
SOME TALKING ABOUT LAYERS OF

01:59:02.768 --> 01:59:03.936
VULNERABILITY AND ACTUALLY.

01:59:04.003 --> 01:59:06.839
ASKING US TO EXPAND WHAT WE

01:59:06.906 --> 01:59:09.509
WERE THINKING OF AS AS SERVICES

01:59:09.575 --> 01:59:11.511
AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO. THE

01:59:11.577 --> 01:59:13.312
COMPETING FORCE IS THIS ONE OF

01:59:13.379 --> 01:59:16.382
CAPACITY- IN ITS ANOTHER THING

01:59:16.449 --> 01:59:18.518
THAT HAS HAS BEEN REFLECTED IN

01:59:18.584 --> 01:59:20.186
THE LOT OF THE COMMENTS THAT

01:59:20.253 --> 01:59:22.755
I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO TODAY-

01:59:22.822 --> 01:59:26.559
AND- IS THAT IS. IT'S NOT THAT

01:59:26.626 --> 01:59:29.428
WE ARE NOT TRYING TO DO THINGS

01:59:29.495 --> 01:59:30.496
FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE AND

01:59:30.563 --> 01:59:32.398
INDIVIDUALS I DO A LOT OF

01:59:32.465 --> 01:59:34.967
RESEARCH IN IN CLINICS- I'M NOT

01:59:35.034 --> 01:59:37.336
A CLINICIAN MYSELF SO I COME IN

01:59:37.403 --> 01:59:39.238
WITH THIS SORT OF. OUTSIDER

01:59:39.305 --> 01:59:41.741
LANDS WHEN I WHEN I DO SO AND

01:59:41.807 --> 01:59:43.509
WHENEVER I GO IN THERE IF I

01:59:43.576 --> 01:59:45.211
MEAN IF I THINK AS A PROFESSOR

01:59:45.278 --> 01:59:46.846
THAT I HAVE A LOT OF DEMANDS ON

01:59:46.913 --> 01:59:47.580
MY TIME I LOOK AT WHAT'S

01:59:47.647 --> 01:59:48.648
HAPPENING IN THE CLINICS AND

01:59:48.714 --> 01:59:50.316
I'M LIKE. I DON'T REALLY HAVE A

01:59:50.383 --> 01:59:52.518
LOT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT RIGHT I

01:59:52.585 --> 01:59:54.220
MEAN THE SHEER NUMBER OF THINGS

01:59:54.287 --> 01:59:55.388
THAT ARE CLINICS HAVE TO DEAL

01:59:55.454 --> 01:59:57.723
WITH JUST TO ADMINISTER CARE TO

01:59:57.790 --> 01:59:58.491
THE MOST VULNERABLE OF

01:59:58.558 --> 02:00:00.960
INDIVIDUALS. IS REALLY QUITE

02:00:01.027 --> 02:00:03.062
REMARKABLE I MEAN NOT ONLY ARE

02:00:03.129 --> 02:00:04.130
THERE ALL THE ISSUES WITH

02:00:04.196 --> 02:00:05.598
INSURANCE THAT YOU HAVE TO

02:00:05.665 --> 02:00:07.300
STRAIGHTEN OUT BUT YOU'LL HAVE

02:00:07.366 --> 02:00:08.834
THINGS LIKE YOU'RE TRYING TO

02:00:08.901 --> 02:00:10.036
REFER PEOPLE TO ALL SORTS OF

02:00:10.102 --> 02:00:12.705
SERVICES. THEY IT'S VERY COMMON

02:00:12.772 --> 02:00:13.639
TO FIND THAT YOU'RE MOST

02:00:13.706 --> 02:00:15.041
VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WILL

02:00:15.107 --> 02:00:17.043
HAVE ISSUES OF SOCIAL ISOLATION

02:00:17.109 --> 02:00:18.811
SO THEY'RE ACTUALLY LEANING ON

02:00:18.878 --> 02:00:20.813
THEIR PROVIDERS TO BE THEIR

02:00:20.880 --> 02:00:22.882
SOURCE OF SOCIAL SUPPORT WHICH

02:00:22.949 --> 02:00:24.417
IS WELL OUTSIDE THE BOUNDS OF

02:00:24.483 --> 02:00:25.751
WHAT WE WOULD TRADITIONALLY

02:00:25.818 --> 02:00:27.219
THINK OF AS AS WHAT THE

02:00:27.286 --> 02:00:29.188
PROVIDERS RESPONSIBILITY IS. IN

02:00:29.255 --> 02:00:31.324
SO AGAINST THAT BACKDROP WERE

02:00:31.390 --> 02:00:32.525
NOW SAYING WE'VE GOT ALL THESE

02:00:32.592 --> 02:00:34.594
DISH ISSUES WE NEED TO DEAL

02:00:34.660 --> 02:00:36.796
WITH AND SO. THERE'S THIS ROOM

02:00:36.862 --> 02:00:38.698
OF HOW DO WE HOW DO WE MAKE IT

02:00:38.764 --> 02:00:40.800
HAPPEN AND RECOGNIZE THAT WE

02:00:40.866 --> 02:00:43.536
ALREADY. IMPOSE A LOT ON OUR

02:00:43.603 --> 02:00:46.606
CLINICS. AND WE CAN'T JUST

02:00:46.672 --> 02:00:48.374
SIMPLY ASK FOR MORE WITHOUT

02:00:48.441 --> 02:00:49.909
THINKING ABOUT HOW DO WE EITHER

02:00:49.976 --> 02:00:51.877
BOLSTER. THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM

02:00:51.944 --> 02:00:53.679
ITSELF FOR RESTRUCTURED IN SOME

02:00:53.746 --> 02:00:55.381
WAY TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO

02:00:55.448 --> 02:00:57.350
DELIVER THOSE EXTRA SERVICES SO

02:00:57.416 --> 02:00:59.318
THERE'S A QUESTION. EARLIER AS

02:00:59.385 --> 02:01:01.087
AN EXAMPLE OF THIS EIGHT THINK-

02:01:01.153 --> 02:01:02.888
MEMBER WALDRON YOU ASKED ABOUT

02:01:02.955 --> 02:01:04.991
CRAP. SO I'VE BEEN ON A STUDY

02:01:05.057 --> 02:01:06.859
IN SAN FRANCISCO THAT'S TRYING

02:01:06.926 --> 02:01:08.694
TO DO PREP AND IT'S IN THAT THE

02:01:08.761 --> 02:01:10.896
COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS THERE

02:01:10.963 --> 02:01:13.766
AND- WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT

02:01:13.833 --> 02:01:14.900
PROVIDERS IT'S NOT THAT

02:01:14.967 --> 02:01:16.135
THEY'RE- DON'T SUPPORT THE

02:01:16.202 --> 02:01:17.970
GOAL. IT'S NOT THAT THEY ARE

02:01:18.037 --> 02:01:19.071
AFRAID OF HAVING THE

02:01:19.138 --> 02:01:21.507
CONVERSATION IT'S THAT THEY ARE

02:01:21.574 --> 02:01:24.577
SO BUSY. THAT THEY ARE HAVING

02:01:24.644 --> 02:01:27.413
TO DO THE CALCULUS OF IF I IF I

02:01:27.480 --> 02:01:29.782
INTRODUCED PREP TO THE PATIENT

02:01:29.849 --> 02:01:31.350
IN FRONT OF ME I KNOW HOW TO

02:01:31.417 --> 02:01:32.385
FOLLOW UP WITH THAT PATIENT

02:01:32.451 --> 02:01:34.020
EVERY FEW MONTHS I HAVE. THIS

02:01:34.086 --> 02:01:35.955
ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITY THAT

02:01:36.022 --> 02:01:38.224
GOES BEYOND KIND OF WHAT MY

02:01:38.290 --> 02:01:39.492
NORMAL ROUTINE IS AND IT'S AN

02:01:39.558 --> 02:01:41.427
EXTRA SOMETHING SO THE WAY

02:01:41.494 --> 02:01:43.496
WE'VE EFFECTIVELY DEALT WITH IT

02:01:43.562 --> 02:01:44.830
IS TO PUT PROP COORDINATORS IN

02:01:44.897 --> 02:01:46.799
PLACE PEOPLE WHO. ARE OFF

02:01:46.866 --> 02:01:49.669
LOADING- SOME OF THAT WORK FOR

02:01:49.735 --> 02:01:51.537
THE PROVIDERS SAID THAT THEY'RE

02:01:51.604 --> 02:01:53.172
NOT CONCERNED ABOUT ABOUT THESE

02:01:53.239 --> 02:01:56.609
KINDS OF. PASSING THE ISSUES-

02:01:56.676 --> 02:01:58.244
MORE GENERAL LATER ALSO

02:01:58.310 --> 02:01:59.645
QUESTIONS THAT COME UP THEIR

02:01:59.712 --> 02:02:01.047
SORT OF INCAPACITY THEY'RE

02:02:01.113 --> 02:02:03.015
STILL QUESTIONS THAT COME UP.

02:02:03.082 --> 02:02:04.216
CLINICS CONSTANTLY HAVE TO LOOK

02:02:04.283 --> 02:02:05.751
AT IN ASK THEMSELVES THE

02:02:05.818 --> 02:02:08.487
QUESTION OF WHO. IS PAYING FOR

02:02:08.554 --> 02:02:10.956
WHAT. IN AS WE DIVERSIFY THE

02:02:11.023 --> 02:02:12.792
KINDS OF SERVICES WERE THINKING

02:02:12.858 --> 02:02:15.494
ABOUT NOT EVERY FUNDING STREAM

02:02:15.561 --> 02:02:17.296
WILL NECESSARILY FIND. EVERY

02:02:17.363 --> 02:02:20.066
KIND SIR AND SO YOU HAVE TO

02:02:20.132 --> 02:02:22.601
THINK ABOUT. IS THERE A FIT.

02:02:22.668 --> 02:02:24.136
THAT'S GOING TO ALLOW A CLINIC

02:02:24.203 --> 02:02:26.205
TO PICK UP IN ADDRESS SOMETHING

02:02:26.272 --> 02:02:27.973
LIKE A TYPE OF VULNERABILITY

02:02:28.040 --> 02:02:29.308
THAT HASN'T BEEN DEALT WITH

02:02:29.375 --> 02:02:30.710
BEFORE AND IS THERE GOING TO BE

02:02:30.776 --> 02:02:33.012
A WAY TO PAY FOR IT AND IN THE-

02:02:33.079 --> 02:02:34.246
IN THE QUESTION THE ANSWER TO

02:02:34.313 --> 02:02:35.314
WHETHER OR NOT THERE WILL BE A

02:02:35.381 --> 02:02:36.949
WAY TO PAY FOR IT. IS A TOTALLY

02:02:37.016 --> 02:02:38.984
DISSATISFIED IT DEPENDS BECAUSE

02:02:39.051 --> 02:02:40.352
IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE SERVICE

02:02:40.419 --> 02:02:42.188
AND IT DEPENDS ON THE KINDS OF

02:02:42.254 --> 02:02:43.456
A FUNDING STREAMS THAT

02:02:43.522 --> 02:02:45.424
PARTICULAR FACILITY HAS

02:02:45.491 --> 02:02:47.860
AVAILABLE. FROM ANOTHER ISSUE

02:02:47.927 --> 02:02:50.229
BECOMES A WHO IS ABLE TO DO

02:02:50.296 --> 02:02:52.531
WHAT- SO SOMETIMES YOU JUST

02:02:52.598 --> 02:02:54.700
SIMPLY DON'T HAVE POSITIONS

02:02:54.767 --> 02:02:56.168
THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE IN ORDER

02:02:56.235 --> 02:02:57.403
TO EXPAND YOUR SERVICES AND

02:02:57.470 --> 02:02:59.004
SOMETIMES. THEY'RE ISSUES

02:02:59.071 --> 02:03:01.373
AROUND THINGS LIKE LICENSING-

02:03:01.440 --> 02:03:02.508
THAT AFFECT WHAT A PERSON CAN

02:03:02.575 --> 02:03:05.444
DO. AND THEN THE THIRD THING IN

02:03:05.511 --> 02:03:07.713
THIS MAY BE MORE TRUE IN I'VE

02:03:07.780 --> 02:03:08.948
SEEN THIS BE MORE TRUE AS A

02:03:09.014 --> 02:03:10.583
CONCERN AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL

02:03:10.649 --> 02:03:11.751
AND I HAVE HERE AT THE STATE

02:03:11.817 --> 02:03:14.687
LEVEL. IS ONE OF TIMELINE SO IF

02:03:14.754 --> 02:03:17.056
WE ARE TRYING TO SOLVE THESE

02:03:17.123 --> 02:03:18.858
KIND OF. MOST WORK WITH THESE

02:03:18.924 --> 02:03:20.459
MOST MOST VULNERABLE OF

02:03:20.526 --> 02:03:24.730
PATIENTS. THESE ARE NOT. THE

02:03:24.797 --> 02:03:25.331
INTERVENTIONS WERE GOING TO DO

02:03:25.397 --> 02:03:26.799
FOR WITH INDIVIDUALS NOT GOING

02:03:26.866 --> 02:03:27.967
TO BE ONES THAT ARE GOING TO

02:03:28.033 --> 02:03:29.935
HAVE A RAPID TURNAROUND. RIGHT

02:03:30.002 --> 02:03:31.637

02:03:31.704 --> 02:03:33.339
I'VE SEEN THIS THURSDAY LET'S

02:03:33.405 --> 02:03:35.441
EXPAND WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO AND

02:03:35.508 --> 02:03:36.675
WILL SHORTEN THE AMOUNT OF TIME

02:03:36.742 --> 02:03:38.077
IN WHICH YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT

02:03:38.144 --> 02:03:39.979
AND THOSE TRENDS JUST. IT

02:03:40.045 --> 02:03:41.847
DOESN'T WORK RIGHT ONE HAS TO

02:03:41.914 --> 02:03:43.282
RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A KIND

02:03:43.349 --> 02:03:45.017
OF LONG RAMP UP PERIOD TO MAKE

02:03:45.084 --> 02:03:47.620
THAT WORK. AND SO AS WERE

02:03:47.686 --> 02:03:48.988
THINKING ABOUT STRATEGIES DAY

02:03:49.054 --> 02:03:51.423
WE DO HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THIS

02:03:51.490 --> 02:03:53.859
TENSION BETWEEN. LAYERS OF

02:03:53.926 --> 02:03:55.694
VULNERABILITY MEAN WE HAVE A

02:03:55.761 --> 02:03:57.730
KIND OF BIGGER FOCUS ON WHAT WE

02:03:57.797 --> 02:03:58.831
NEED TO DO BUT AT THE SAME

02:03:58.898 --> 02:04:00.966
TIME. WE ALREADY AVE A VERY

02:04:01.033 --> 02:04:03.302
TAXED HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. AND IF

ANYTHING IT'S- GETTING MORE

02:04:04.870 --> 02:04:07.773

INCARCERATIONS SIGNIFICANTLY

02:05:18.544 --> 02:05:21.447
IMPACTS PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING.

I'M NOT GOING TO KIND OF DETAIL

02:05:27.686 --> 02:05:28.754
IN YOU KNOW THE OUTLINE OF

02:05:28.821 --> 02:05:29.889
COULD WHAT HAPPENS DURING

02:05:29.955 --> 02:05:31.156
INCARCERATION I REALLY WANT TO

02:05:31.223 --> 02:05:33.826
FOCUS MORE ON. THE TRANSITION.

02:05:33.893 --> 02:05:35.327
FROM THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE

02:05:35.394 --> 02:05:37.062
SYSTEM BACK TO THE COMMUNITY.

02:05:37.129 --> 02:05:38.898
BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT-

02:05:38.964 --> 02:05:40.699
WHAT PEOPLE ARE INCARCERATED

02:05:40.766 --> 02:05:41.467
THEIR IN A VERY HIGHLY

02:05:41.533 --> 02:05:44.003
STRUCTURED ENVIRONMENT- IT'S-

02:05:44.069 --> 02:05:45.504
OFTEN TIMES EASIER TO GET

02:05:45.571 --> 02:05:47.640
THEIR- CHRONIC CONDITIONS UNDER

02:05:47.706 --> 02:05:49.174
CONTROL H. A. B. IS A GOOD

02:05:49.241 --> 02:05:50.709
EXAMPLE- WE OFTEN SEE PEOPLE.

02:05:50.776 --> 02:05:52.478
HAVING REDUCE VIRAL LOADS IN

02:05:52.544 --> 02:05:53.979
THE CABLE TO SEE SUSTAIN THOSE

02:05:54.046 --> 02:05:55.547
IN THAT ENVIRONMENT. AND IT'S

02:05:55.614 --> 02:05:56.949
THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE THEN

02:05:57.016 --> 02:05:58.550
RETURNED TO THE COMMUNITY THAT

02:05:58.617 --> 02:06:00.319
OFTENTIMES VERY DIFFICULT TO

02:06:00.386 --> 02:06:01.887
SUSTAIN THOSE GAINS THAT PEOPLE

02:06:01.954 --> 02:06:02.888
MAY EXPERIENCE DURING

02:06:02.955 --> 02:06:05.124
PERSPIRATION IN THE COMMUNITY-

02:06:05.190 --> 02:06:06.692
ONE STUDY FOR INSTANCE SHOWED

02:06:06.759 --> 02:06:08.027
THAT. OF PEOPLE COMING OUT OF

02:06:08.093 --> 02:06:10.863
INCARCERATION- ONLY 30% OF THEM

02:06:10.930 --> 02:06:12.431
PICKED UP THE PEOPLE WITH HIV

02:06:12.498 --> 02:06:13.565
ONLY 30% OF THEM PICKED UP

02:06:13.632 --> 02:06:16.168
THEIR- MEDICATIONS IN THE FIRST

02:06:16.235 --> 02:06:18.270
SIXTY DAYS POST RELEASE. I'M IN

02:06:18.337 --> 02:06:19.305
A BIG PART OF THIS IS THAT

02:06:19.371 --> 02:06:22.374
THERE'S REALLY VERY LITTLE-

02:06:22.441 --> 02:06:24.476
CONTINUITY OF CARE FROM THE

02:06:24.543 --> 02:06:25.477
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM TO THE

02:06:25.544 --> 02:06:29.114
PRIMARY HEALTH. SYSTEM THE CROW

02:06:29.181 --> 02:06:30.849
JUSTICE SYSTEM IS A PUNITIVE

02:06:30.916 --> 02:06:32.318
ENTITY. INTEL RE. THERE WAS

02:06:32.384 --> 02:06:34.153
ALMOST NO FUNDING IN PLACE TO

02:06:34.219 --> 02:06:35.921
PROVIDE ANY SORT OF DISCHARGED.

02:06:35.988 --> 02:06:38.057
SERVICES OF FOR PEOPLE ARE

02:06:38.123 --> 02:06:40.159
RETURNING FROM CAR SERRATION

02:06:40.225 --> 02:06:42.161
AND AS A RESULT OF WHAT WE SEE

02:06:42.227 --> 02:06:45.965
IS THAT PEOPLE ARE. MORE LIKELY

02:06:46.031 --> 02:06:50.202
TO DIE GET THE POSED PLEASE. NO

02:06:50.269 --> 02:06:51.503
IN ADDITION TO THE CONDITIONS

02:06:51.570 --> 02:06:53.305
OF SITTING THERE MORE LIKE TO

02:06:53.372 --> 02:06:57.209
BE. SO WE KNOW THAT ONE IN

02:06:57.276 --> 02:06:59.445
TWELVE P. THE HOSPITAL IN THE

02:06:59.511 --> 02:07:02.881
FIRST NINE DAYS. PROBABLY OF

02:07:02.948 --> 02:07:07.853
WHAT ALSO THAT PEOPLE TO. OVER

02:07:07.920 --> 02:07:14.793
PARTY OF. DISEASE IS. AND

02:07:14.860 --> 02:07:15.928
CONNECTIONS OF CARE FROM THE

02:07:15.995 --> 02:07:18.263
INCARCERATED SETTING UP BACK TO

02:07:18.330 --> 02:07:20.299
THE COMMUNITY. SO THE WORK THAT

02:07:20.366 --> 02:07:22.001
WE DO IN THE TRANSITIONS CLICK

02:07:22.067 --> 02:07:23.736
NETWORK IS REALLY- WORKING WITH

02:07:23.802 --> 02:07:25.671
THE PRIMARY CARE SYSTEM TO

02:07:25.738 --> 02:07:28.073
TRANSFORM WHAT CLINICS DUE TO

02:07:28.140 --> 02:07:29.174
BETTER MEET THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE

02:07:29.241 --> 02:07:30.409
COMING HOME AND REALLY TRY TO

02:07:30.476 --> 02:07:32.311
CLOSE THAT GAP. AND PROVIDE

02:07:32.378 --> 02:07:33.746
CONTINUITY OF CARE TO PEOPLE

WHO ARE COMING HOME FROM

02:07:34.346 --> 02:07:35.948
INCARCERATION AND- IT'S

02:07:36.015 --> 02:07:37.483
UNFORTUNATE THAT MEMBER GIPSON

02:07:37.549 --> 02:07:38.717
STEPPED OUT BECAUSE WHAT I WAS

02:07:38.784 --> 02:07:39.752

THIS EPIDEMIC HAS IMPACTED THEM

02:07:44.990 --> 02:07:46.058
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S REALLY

02:07:46.125 --> 02:07:47.893
WHAT. MOTIVATES PEOPLE TO MAKE

02:07:47.960 --> 02:07:49.328

HAVE THAT SHARED EXPERIENCE

02:07:54.099 --> 02:07:55.134

EXPERIENCE OF INCARCERATION-

02:08:18.757 --> 02:08:19.625
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO

02:08:19.691 --> 02:08:21.660
WITH THE CLINICS IS THAT WE

02:08:21.727 --> 02:08:22.528

WORKING WITHIN- THE

THAT GOVERNMENT HAS PUT IN

PLACE. I THINK ALL THE SPEAKERS

TODAY. HAVE OFFERED- VERY

02:19:01.833 --> 02:19:05.036
USEFUL FEEDBACK- ABOUT SOME OF

02:19:05.103 --> 02:19:06.971
THOSE STRUCTURES AND SYSTEMS I

02:19:07.038 --> 02:19:08.139
WANT TO SHED LIGHT ON SOME

02:19:08.206 --> 02:19:10.241
THINGS WERE SEEN AT THE COUNTY

02:19:10.308 --> 02:19:12.944
LEVEL. THE FIRST IS- LA COUNTY

02:19:13.011 --> 02:19:15.814
IS HOME 226% OF CALIFORNIANS-

02:19:15.880 --> 02:19:17.749
AS SOON WITH ME NOW. BUT WE

02:19:17.816 --> 02:19:19.184
SHOULDER ABOUT A THIRD OF THE

02:19:19.250 --> 02:19:22.420
STATE'S HIV AND STD EPIDEMICS-

02:19:22.487 --> 02:19:24.222
CALIFORNIA OUR GEAR GOLDEN

02:19:24.289 --> 02:19:26.257
STATE- HAS THE UNFLATTERING

02:19:26.324 --> 02:19:28.193
DISTINCTION. OF NOW BEING A

02:19:28.259 --> 02:19:29.994
LEADER- IN TERMS OF THE

02:19:30.061 --> 02:19:32.764
ABSOLUTE- NUMBER OF CASES- WITH

02:19:32.831 --> 02:19:35.033
RESPECT HIV AN INTERNMENT ONLY

02:19:35.100 --> 02:19:38.103
WITH STDS. AND IT'S TROUBLING

02:19:38.169 --> 02:19:40.271
THAT WE ARE LOSING PROGRESS TO

02:19:40.338 --> 02:19:44.375
OTHER PARTS- OF- OTHER PUBLIC

02:19:44.442 --> 02:19:46.144
HEALTH RESPONSE ACROSS THE

02:19:46.211 --> 02:19:47.812
COUNTRY. AND IT'S SOBERING

02:19:47.879 --> 02:19:51.950
THAT. VERY PROGRESS THROUGHOUT.

02:19:52.016 --> 02:19:55.220
AND SO- THE FIRST. THE FIRST

02:19:55.286 --> 02:19:57.422
OBSERVATION I WANT TO SHARE IS

02:19:57.489 --> 02:20:00.725
THAT WE HAVE A SERIOUS CAPACITY

02:20:00.792 --> 02:20:02.360
AND INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUE IN

02:20:02.427 --> 02:20:05.163
CALIFORNIA WE CAN EXPECT TO

02:20:05.230 --> 02:20:07.332
RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDS TO

02:20:07.398 --> 02:20:09.400
FURTHER ENHANCE OUR RESPONSE TO

02:20:09.467 --> 02:20:12.237
HIV OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS

02:20:12.303 --> 02:20:13.571
BASED ON THE NATIONAL ANY

02:20:13.638 --> 02:20:16.441
EPIDEMIC INITIATIVE. BUT I FEAR

02:20:16.508 --> 02:20:18.443
THAT WE DO NOT HAVE THE

02:20:18.510 --> 02:20:21.713
INFRASTRUCTURE AND WORKFORCE-

02:20:21.780 --> 02:20:24.516
NECESSARY TO MOBILIZE AND

02:20:24.582 --> 02:20:25.984
MARSHALL RESOURCES IN A WAY

02:20:26.050 --> 02:20:27.318
THAT HAVE THE GREATEST IMPACT

02:20:27.385 --> 02:20:28.820
ON A MUCH MORE UP MOTHER FATHER

02:20:28.887 --> 02:20:32.123
EARLIER SHED LIGHT ON ON THIS.

02:20:32.190 --> 02:20:33.925
WE HAVE GOAL TO DIAGNOSE TREAT

02:20:33.992 --> 02:20:36.327
AND PREVENT HIV- BUT WE STILL

02:20:36.394 --> 02:20:38.963
HAVE VERY ON EVEN PERFORMANCE

02:20:39.030 --> 02:20:40.131
IF YOU'RE PART OF THE RYAN

02:20:40.198 --> 02:20:42.167
WHITE SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. YOU

02:20:42.233 --> 02:20:43.568
HAVE SOME OF THE BEST HEALTH

02:20:43.635 --> 02:20:45.470
OUTCOMES IF YOU ARE NOT PART

02:20:45.537 --> 02:20:47.772
THE RYAN WHITE SYSTEM YOU HAVE

02:20:47.839 --> 02:20:52.143
HEALTH OUTCOMES ARE POOR UP OR

02:20:52.210 --> 02:20:54.946
DIAGNOSIS FOR RATES. REALLY

02:20:55.013 --> 02:20:56.314
GETS TO CARE RATE. THIS

02:20:56.381 --> 02:20:59.017
ENCOURAGED A DOCTOR CAREMARK'S

02:20:59.083 --> 02:21:00.852
DOM REFERENCE TO CARE

02:21:00.919 --> 02:21:02.787
COORDINATION AS PART OF THE

02:21:02.854 --> 02:21:05.990
MEDICAID SYSTEM THAT IS BEEN A

02:21:06.057 --> 02:21:08.059
STAPLE IN THE RYAN WHITE SYSTEM

02:21:08.126 --> 02:21:11.029
FOR TWO DECADES AND SO I THINK

02:21:11.095 --> 02:21:11.896
THAT THERE ARE SOME SOLUTIONS

02:21:11.963 --> 02:21:14.532
THERE THAT WE NEED TO

02:21:14.599 --> 02:21:16.701
EXTRAPOLATE FROM THE RYAN WHITE

02:21:16.768 --> 02:21:18.336
SYSTEM ALL THE OTHER HEALTH

02:21:18.403 --> 02:21:21.005
CARE DELIVERY COMES CALIFORNIA

02:21:21.072 --> 02:21:23.675
I DARE SAY THAT WE NEED TO GO

02:21:23.741 --> 02:21:24.576
THROUGH SOME SERIOUS HEALTH

02:21:24.642 --> 02:21:27.312
FROM IN STATE. ARTISTS ARE TOO

02:21:27.378 --> 02:21:29.013
MANY WELL WITH UNDIAGNOSED HIV

02:21:29.080 --> 02:21:31.683
INFECTION IN CALIFORNIA KERN

02:21:31.749 --> 02:21:33.518
AFTER POPULAR TWENTY THOU. IT

02:21:33.585 --> 02:21:35.453
IS GETTING HER. PART DIAGNOSED

02:21:35.520 --> 02:21:37.622
PEOPLE WITH HIV THERE ARE FAR

02:21:37.689 --> 02:21:38.857
TOO MANY PEOPLE IN THE SHADOWS

02:21:38.923 --> 02:21:40.425
AND MARGINS AND WE'RE GONNA

02:21:40.491 --> 02:21:42.560
MEET STATE POLICY. TO HELP

02:21:42.627 --> 02:21:45.029
CHANGE SYSTEMS OF HEALTH CARE

02:21:45.096 --> 02:21:47.131
SO THAT WE ROUTE NICE HIV

02:21:47.198 --> 02:21:49.300
TESTING. IT'LL HELP- NORMALIZE

02:21:49.367 --> 02:21:51.236
IT AND I THINK THAT WILL BE

02:21:51.302 --> 02:21:54.105
ABLE TO DIAGNOSE A BIG CHUNK OF

02:21:54.172 --> 02:21:55.340
THE TWENTY THOUSAND

02:21:55.406 --> 02:21:56.875
CALIFORNIANS LIVING WITH HIV OR

02:21:56.941 --> 02:21:59.611

COMPLIMENTED WITH THE STILL

02:22:00.245 --> 02:22:02.513
VERY IMPORTANT TARGETED HIV

MARK BY THE WAY WAS MY

02:36:28.112 --> 02:36:29.346
ATTENDING PHYSICIAN IN MY

02:36:34.418 --> 02:36:36.887
HER SAY THAT IT. CITY HIV

02:36:36.954 --> 02:36:38.088
MEDICINES DON'T HAVE PRIOR

02:36:38.155 --> 02:36:39.890
AUTHORIZATIONS. YOU KNOW HOW

02:36:39.957 --> 02:36:41.225
MUCH EASIER MY LIFE WOULD BE A

02:36:41.291 --> 02:36:42.726
PEPSI MEDICINE TO NOT A PRIOR

02:36:42.793 --> 02:36:44.962
AUTHORIZATIONS. I HAVE A FULL

02:36:45.028 --> 02:36:46.797
TIME EMPLOYED NURSE IN MY

02:36:46.864 --> 02:36:49.099
CLINIC THAT HER ONLY JOB IS TO

02:36:49.166 --> 02:36:50.467
HANDLE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION. IT

02:36:50.534 --> 02:36:51.635
IS AN INCREDIBLE BURDEN OF

02:36:51.702 --> 02:36:52.903
PAPERWORK I JUST TO GET

02:36:52.970 --> 02:36:54.238
SOMEBODY TREATED INVOLVES EXTRA

02:36:54.304 --> 02:36:55.639
TIME EXTRA BLOOD TESTS THAT

02:36:55.706 --> 02:36:57.641
AREN'T REALLY. NECESSARY WE

02:36:57.708 --> 02:36:58.342
JUST NEED TO STREAMLINE THE

02:36:58.408 --> 02:37:00.277
PROCESS IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE

02:37:00.344 --> 02:37:01.779
TO GET THESE PEOPLE TREATED. I

02:37:01.845 --> 02:37:02.780
THOUGHT I SHOULD BRING THIS UP

02:37:02.846 --> 02:37:03.847
NOW BECAUSE WITH THE

02:37:03.914 --> 02:37:05.616
MEDICATIONS THE ISSUE OF COST

02:37:05.682 --> 02:37:06.517
ALWAYS COMES UP. AND THAT'S

02:37:06.583 --> 02:37:07.484
BECAUSE WHEN THEY FIRST CAME

02:37:07.551 --> 02:37:09.820
OUT. THE MEDICINES WERE VERY

02:37:09.887 --> 02:37:11.388
HIGHLY PRIZED. THEY WERE HIGHLY

02:37:11.455 --> 02:37:12.656
PRIZED BECAUSE THE PRIOR

02:37:12.723 --> 02:37:14.458
TREATMENT WAS A YEAR LONG.

02:37:14.525 --> 02:37:16.160
REQUIRED OFTEN HOSPITALIZATIONS

02:37:16.226 --> 02:37:18.128
BLOOD TEST AND ONLY AT A 40%

02:37:18.195 --> 02:37:19.830
CURE RATE. AND NEARLY KILLED

02:37:19.897 --> 02:37:20.631
SOME OF THE PEOPLE ARE TREATED

02:37:20.697 --> 02:37:21.632
WITH THE OLD INTERFERON

02:37:21.698 --> 02:37:23.300
TREATMENT SO THE INNOVATION TO

02:37:23.367 --> 02:37:24.735
TAKE A PILL FOR JUST THREE

02:37:24.802 --> 02:37:25.669
MONTHS. HAD A BIG PRICE TAG ON

02:37:25.736 --> 02:37:27.938
IT. THERE WAS SOMETHING CALLED

02:37:28.005 --> 02:37:29.606
THE INSTITUTE FOR CLINICAL AND

02:37:29.673 --> 02:37:30.440
ECONOMIC REVIEW THAT WAS

02:37:30.507 --> 02:37:32.776
CONVENED- AND THE CALIFORNIA

02:37:32.843 --> 02:37:34.311
TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT FORM TOLD

02:37:34.378 --> 02:37:35.712
STUDY THIS ISSUE AND SAY WHY

02:37:35.779 --> 02:37:36.947
ARE THEY SO EXPENSIVE AND WHAT

02:37:37.014 --> 02:37:37.848
IS THE COST EFFECTIVENESS

02:37:37.915 --> 02:37:39.550
THRESHOLD. TO GET THESE HAVE

SEE TREATMENTS DOWN TO WHERE

02:37:40.484 --> 02:37:42.152
IT'S REASONABLE. IN THE LINE

02:37:42.219 --> 02:37:43.554
THAT THAT COMMISSION CAME UP

02:37:43.620 --> 02:37:44.488
WITH A SPONSORED BY THE

02:38:01.071 --> 02:38:01.905
EXPENSIVE TO DO A LIVER

02:52:47.323 --> 02:52:50.927
THINK THAT THE YOU. YES THE

02:52:50.993 --> 02:52:52.829
CRISIS PARTICULAR IS WOLF ON

02:52:52.895 --> 02:52:56.999
FINANCE AND THE H. A. B.

02:52:57.066 --> 02:52:58.468
RESPOND TO THE- HAS FOR THE

02:52:58.534 --> 02:53:00.069
PART KEPT PACE. THE

02:53:00.136 --> 02:53:00.803
APPROPRIATIONS AT THE FEDERAL

02:53:00.870 --> 02:53:03.840
AND LEVEL WITH THE INCREASED

02:53:03.906 --> 02:53:05.374
DEMAND FOR SERVICES AND

02:53:05.441 --> 02:53:06.976
REGRETTABLY WE'VE GONE

02:53:07.043 --> 02:53:09.178
BACKWARDS WITH STDS WE'VE LOST

02:53:09.245 --> 02:53:10.613
40% OF THAT THE PURCHASING

02:53:10.680 --> 02:53:11.447
POWER THE LAST DECADE AND A

02:53:11.514 --> 02:53:14.550
HALF. AND THERE'S BEEN EROSION

02:53:14.617 --> 02:53:16.352
OF STD CLINIC INFRASTRUCTURE I

02:53:16.419 --> 02:53:17.453
THINK THAT WAS HIGHLIGHTED A

02:53:17.520 --> 02:53:21.324
LITTLE BIT EARLIER AND WE HAVE-

02:53:21.390 --> 02:53:23.359
US- HE THIS MEASURE FOR

02:53:23.426 --> 02:53:26.229
CHLAMYDIA AND WE'RE STUCK AT

02:53:26.295 --> 02:53:28.364
5455% SO I THINK WE HAVE TO

02:53:28.431 --> 02:53:30.399
FIGURE OUT A NEW APPROACH OR

02:53:30.466 --> 02:53:31.534
STRATEGY TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:53:31.601 --> 02:53:34.303
HEALTH PLANS ARE ARE IN FACT

02:53:34.370 --> 02:53:38.908
IT'S A PRIORITY- TO INCREASE

02:53:38.975 --> 02:53:39.375
YOU KNOW SEXUAL HEALTH

02:53:39.442 --> 02:53:40.243
PROGRAMMING. BOTH IN THE PUBLIC

02:53:40.309 --> 02:53:42.745
SECTOR BUT ALSO THE COMMERCIAL

02:53:42.812 --> 02:53:45.348
PLAN SECTOR- AND YOU KNOW THE

02:53:45.414 --> 02:53:50.787
SURPLUS EPIDEMIC WE CAN'T. THIS

02:53:50.853 --> 02:53:54.056
THE CA TIED THE CIVIL. IS

02:53:54.123 --> 02:53:56.959
EXT. CHALLENGING AND THE

02:53:57.026 --> 02:53:57.994
MANIFESTATIONS WE SEE IN WE

02:53:58.060 --> 02:53:59.862
HEAR ABOUT YOU KNOW BABIES

02:53:59.929 --> 02:54:01.497
EXPOSED TO SYPHILIS. BUT WE

02:54:01.564 --> 02:54:03.466
ALSO NEED TO UNDERSTAND AS LONG

02:54:03.533 --> 02:54:05.134
AS THERE'S A POOL OF INFECTIONS

02:54:05.201 --> 02:54:07.537
REFERENCE BEFORE. OF SYPHILIS

02:54:07.603 --> 02:54:09.906
AMMAN- WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING

02:54:09.972 --> 02:54:12.408
AGE WE'RE GONNA SEE SURPLUS

02:54:12.475 --> 02:54:15.645
AMMAN- NEWBORNS. BUT WE HAVE TO

02:54:15.711 --> 02:54:17.914
GO ONE STEP FURTHER AS LONG AS

02:54:17.980 --> 02:54:19.348
WE HAVE A SURPLUS EPIDEMIC IN

02:54:19.415 --> 02:54:22.251
CALIFORNIA. AMONG MEN. THEIR

02:54:22.318 --> 02:54:24.086
HEAD OF SEXUAL AND BI SEXUAL

02:54:24.153 --> 02:54:25.888
THAT'S BURGEONING AND IT'S

02:54:25.955 --> 02:54:28.157
MULTIPLE FOLD HIGHER THAN THE

02:54:28.224 --> 02:54:29.992
EPIDEMIC AMONG WOMEN YOU CAN

02:54:30.059 --> 02:54:31.127
HAVE AN EPIDEMIC AMONG WOMEN.

02:54:31.194 --> 02:54:33.596
AND SO WE CAN'T JUST HAVE A ONE

02:54:33.663 --> 02:54:35.631
PROPER APPROACH TO SYPHILIS IT

02:54:35.698 --> 02:54:38.301
NEEDS TO BE MULTI PRONG. AND

02:54:38.367 --> 02:54:40.703
CIVIL CONTROL AMONG MEN YES IT

02:54:40.770 --> 02:54:42.872
WAS CONTROL AMONG WOMEN. AT THE

02:54:42.939 --> 02:54:49.345
NEWBORNS NEEDS TO BE. ABOUT

02:54:49.412 --> 02:54:52.281

JUST ADD YOU KNOW YOU HAVE VERY

02:54:53.950 --> 02:54:56.752
STRONG FROM WHERE YOU'RE PERCH

02:54:56.819 --> 02:54:58.054
TO AN YOU'RE SAID AND I THINK

02:54:58.120 --> 02:54:59.789
THAT WHILE THIS MIGHT WE REALLY

02:54:59.856 --> 02:55:00.523
APPRECIATE THE TO SHARE THIS AT

02:55:00.590 --> 02:55:03.326
THE TO. AND KIND OF BE THINKING

02:55:03.392 --> 02:55:06.262
ABOUT HOW WE KEEP PUTTING WIND

02:55:06.329 --> 02:55:08.564
BEHIND IT THIS SALE BECAUSE WE

02:55:08.631 --> 02:55:09.332
NEED TO GET TO THE FINISH LINE

02:55:09.398 --> 02:55:11.100
SO WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OTHER

02:55:11.167 --> 02:55:13.135
WAYS THAT WE CAN INCREASE

02:55:13.202 --> 02:55:15.838
AWARENESS. WITH AND AMONG THE

02:55:15.905 --> 02:55:17.907

UNFORTUNATELY HAVE HAD-

02:55:23.312 --> 02:55:26.048
HISTORICALLY OVER TIME HAD TO

02:55:26.115 --> 02:55:27.650

NOT A MOVEMENT OR CHAMPIONS FOR

02:55:35.391 --> 02:55:37.860
AS TV OR EIGHT CV AND NOW NOT

02:55:37.927 --> 02:55:38.961
