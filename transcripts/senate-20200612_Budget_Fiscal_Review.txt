WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO THANK THE LA OLD OFFICE AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOR PARTICIPATING AND WILL RECOGNIZE THE VICE CHAIR IF HE HAS ANY OPENING COMMENTS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THIS GOING TO BE ONE OF THE MORE DIFFICULT BUDGETS THAT WE'VE HAD TO DEAL WITH. THE CORONAVIRUS SITUATION IS GREATLY CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES FOR US AND COMPROMISED THE BUDGET PROCESS IF YOU CAN CALL IT A PROCESS. THE IT IT'S MORE A SCRUM THESE DAYS UNFORTUNATELY. WE'VE PROBABLY DONE THE BEST WE CAN BUT IN TERMS OF THE PUBLIC THIS IS NOT A BUDGET THAT WE KNOW A LOT ABOUT. USUALLY WE SPEND COUNTLESS HOURS OVER MONTHS IN OUR SUBCOMMITTEE WORK TO REALLY SCRUTINIZE EACH AGENCIES BUDGET AND THE VARIOUS SUBJECT AREAS WE'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT WE HAD ONE HEARING. AND NOW WE ARE CONFRONTED WITH THE- DECISION TO GET A BUDGET OUT HERE BY THE FIFTEEN. THE BUDGET THAT'S PREDICATED ON QUESTION MARKS IN THE FUTURE. THAT'S A DIFFICULT WAY TO BUILD A BUDGET. WE'RE GOING TO DO THE BEST WE CAN AND I SUPPOSE WE HAVE THUS FAR I WILL HAVE SOME COMPLAINTS ABOUT SOME ASPECT OF THE BUDGET. AND WE DO HAVE TO GET A BUDGET. BUT KEEP IN MIND WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE SOLVING FUTURE PROBLEMS FOR THE MOST PART WE'RE PUTTING THINGS ASIDE KICKING IT DOWN THE ROAD JUST A BIT. INCLUDING PREDICATE IN A LOT OF HOPE. IN FEDERAL FUNDS OF WHICH I DON'T HAVE MUCH CONFIDENCE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR VICE CHAIR SO LET'S BEGIN WITH THE LA ALL WHO GIVE US A BRIEF OVERVIEW AGAIN OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SENATE VERSION OF THE BUDGET. AND THE LEGISLATIVE AGREEMENT THAT WE WILL HERE ON THIS FLOOR ON MONDAY GOOD MORNING MR PECK THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR- YES MY NAME IS GAVE CREDIT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST. AND AS YOU SAID AS AS THE CHAIR SAID IT TODAY WILL PRESENT. SUMMARY DESCRIBING SOME OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE EARLIER TALKED ABOUT SENATE BUDGET PACKAGE AND THE LEGISLATIVE AGREEMENT. BUDGET PACKAGE. MY REMARKS ARE OUTLINED BY THE BRIEF HANDOUT WHICH I HOPE THAT YOU HAVE. AND FOR THOSE FOLLOWING A LINE IT CAN BE FOUND AT OUR WEBSITE ILIO DOT C. H. GOV. MY REMARKS WILL BE BRIEF BECAUSE IN THE TO PASS ARE FERRIES TO ONE ANOTHER. THEY TAKE A BROAD LEAF APPROACH. RATHER S. ON. MAY SPENDING ASSUMPTION. AND A SIMILAR APPROACH TO ASSUMPTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE RECEIPT OF FEDERAL. SO WHAT THAT MOVED TO THE FIRST PAGE OF THE HANDOUT BECAUSE- HERE IT DOES. ON THE SLIDE A CUP OF THEIR- IN WHICH THE LET'S JUST BY PACK WITH PROVIDE SOME OUR- RELICS TO THE SENATE BUDGET PACKAGE. THE FIRST ITEM LIST THERE THE COUNTY RELYING ASSIST. YOU'LL SEE THAT THE LETTER BODY PACKAGE WITH PROVIDE FOR HER BILLION MORE IN ONE. A FOR REAL PRO THE MISTER BUDGET CONTEMPLATED. AND ANOTHER AREA OF I'M IS THE ABOUT A MILLION MORE LOCAL. HOMELESSNESS PROGRAM FUNDING. SO THAT WOULD THREE HUNDRED AND MILLION RATHER THAN THE TWO AND FIFTY MILLION THE SENATE BUDGET PACKAGE. AND THEN. NEED THAT THERE IS ADDITION FEDERAL ASSISTANCE. YOU'LL SEE THE LAW PACKAGE PROVIDE SOME BASIC FUNDING ARE GOING TO FOR THE- OF THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION. THE LATEST BUDGET MAIN THE TO THE EARNED INCOME TAX. THAT THIS PACKAGE IN CASE. THIS THAT IT WOULDN'T THE X. TO TAX FILING AYE INTO TACK I. INDIVIDUAL TAX IDEA NOT. IT INTO THOSE INDIVIDUAL WITH KNOWLEDGE AGES SIX AND I. THE LEGISLATIVE BY PACKAGE DOES HOW MAKE A TECHNIQUE JUST TO THAT AND SO YOU SEE IT'S THIS SIXTY FIVE MILLION RATHER THAN FORTY TO ME. THEN MOVING TO THE PAGE. THIS IS A SLIDE WERE WE SOME THE NOTED DIFFERENCE BUT THE TWO. BEGINNING WITH THE MANAGED CARE. HAVE IN THE SENATE. THROUGH AN S. THERE WAS. PROVISION THAT WOULD. MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE MCO TAX TO GENERATE AROUND DOLLARS OF GEN FUND SAVINGS THE EVENT THAT THERE IS NO FEDERAL. THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE JUST INCLUDE THIS FOR. THEN IN ADDITION DE LEGISLATIVE PACK TAKES DIFFERENT TO THE MAILER PROPOSAL TO ESTABLISH A COVERT NOW CONTENDED FUND AS YOU RECALL THE NEIGHBOR INCLUDED A PROPOSAL TO CREATE THIS COMMENT. CONTINGENCIES WHICH WOULD BE TO PAY NINE. I THAT SEVEN AND SEE MILLION WAS GOING TO BE FROM THE GENERAL FROM A GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION. WITH THE REMAINING TWO POINT TWO BILLION. REALLY COMING FROM AN ANTICIPATED RECEITA THE MASS FUNDS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO THE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET PACKAGE TAKES A DIFFERENT APPROACH HERE IN MOVING TO TAKE A SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN MILLION AND DESIGNATED WITHIN SPECIAL FUND FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY AND THAT DESIGNATION WOULD BE. KIND OF YOUR MARK IN A WAY FOR A CODE RELATED ACTIVITIES RATHER% THAN CREATING THAT THE CALL WITH NINETY CONTENT FUND. ANOTHER DE IS WITH REGARD TO THE- DEFERRAL OF THE JUNE AND STATE WORKER PAYROLL- FROM JUNE TO JULY. SO THE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET PACKAGE RATHER THAN INCLUDING THAT OUT RIGHT IT DOES INCLUDED BUT IT MAKES THE DEFERRAL CONTENTION ON EIGHT JANUARY DETERMINATION SO IN JANUARY. YES THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ESTIMATES THAT THE STATE'S FISCAL CONDITION IS BETTER THAN IT IS AT THE TIME OF BUDGET ENACTMENT AND BY THAT WE WOULD YOU KNOW THINK OF REVENUES BEING HIGHER OR EXPENDITURES BEING LOWER THAN IT THEN AS SOON GET THE TIME OF BUDGET ENACTMENT IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN THE DEFERRAL WOULD NOT BE MADE. HOWEVER IF THE STATE'S FISCAL CONDITION IS DETERMINED TO BE. NOT AS STRONG AT THAT IN JANUARY THEN THE DEFERRAL WOULD BE MADE. THEN LAST LESS TWO ITEMS OF OUR ONE IS IN THE OF THEM COME. THE LATEST BUDGET. INCLUDES BETWEEN ONE POINT FIVE BILL TO POINT NINE BILLION OF US YOU STATING BUT ONLY IN THE THAT THERE IS NO DISH FEDERAL. THAT BECOMES A IN THE COMING MY- AND THEN LASTLY. THE SENATE BUDGET. YOU RECALL INCLUDED ARE. FOR THE CA THROUGH CAN YOU COLLEGE PROGRAMS OF NINE BILLION DOLLARS. AND I AM THE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET PACKAGE MAINTAINS THIS APPROACH USING THE DEFERRALS. BUT IT ACTION DOESN'T IT BY ABOUT SIX HUNDRED MILLION TO ACCOUNT FOR IT TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT THAT WAS ME. AND SO WITH THAT ARE THE MAIN. THE MAIN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE BUDGET PACKED IN THE SAN BUDGET THE CONSIDER PREVIOUS. AND I'LL BE HAPPY TO. TAKE QUESTIONS OR WITH LIKE. WHEN IT'S- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR PATRICK I APPRECIATE YOU AND WANTED. THAT OF MY COLLEAGUES THE AND WHOM SAY SENATE VERSUS LEDGES. OF THE TO CALL WHERE. THE TO PAY TO GO DEAL WITH THE US AND THE SENATE THAT'S- LET THE HE CALLED LEAD TO FIT AGREEMENT IN THE REPORT THANK YOU. MISTER THIS WILL NOT ON DEPARTMENT. DIDN'T ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO ADD TO LOW. WHAT MR PAY. BECOME FROM USER. OF ALL WE SAY THAT WE THAT IF PARTY GO SHE ARE. ALL THIS WEEK ANALYZE WAIT FOR THE WEEKEND SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO DISCUSS ALL THESE I WHAT THE- THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITH. ALL OPEN IT UP FOR MEN QUESTIONS THE- REGARDING THE CHAIN THAT HAVE IN COURT. INTO THE VERSION WAS WITH SENATOR DORADO. THANK YOU MADAM TO I JUST HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE LA YOU ON THE R. AM CO TAX. OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SENATE AND THE LEGISLATURE. WHAT IS THE IMPACT THROUGH THE EFFECT OF NOT EXPLICITLY INCLUDING ADJUSTMENTS TO THE TO THE TAX WHAT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN AS FAR AS. NGUYEN CLUED OR NOVEL I AM NOT IT'S NOT VERY CLEAR. OKAY WELL ALL MENTION THAT AND THEN I'LL MY COLLEAGUE MARK NEWTON- DESCRIBE IT IF HE HAS A DISH CON. THAT'S IN THE SAME PACK THE YOU CAN SEE BEFORE THERE WOULD BE A- THERE WOULD AND TO THE TAX THAT WOULD GENERATE ADDITIONAL- REVENUE AND RESULT IN A GENERAL FUND BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT BILLION DOLLARS. AND THAT WAS A PROVISION THAT WAS INCLUDED IN THE- IN THE- SENATE REGIONAL SENATE PACKAGE IN THE EVENT THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL FUNDING ON THE LEGISLATIVE WE AGREE. PACKAGE DOESN'T JUST AS NOT AND THIS FOR MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. IT'S IS JUST AS MORE APPROACH BE THE NCO TAP WOULD. REQUIRE A TWO YOU KNOW IF. FEDERAL CONSENT OR APPROVAL SO IF REMOVES IT IN A CENTER REMOVES THE RISK OF NOT RISK FEDERAL GROUP FOR BY NODDING IT AS A- AS A ISSUE PROVISION I DON'T KNOW MARK A NEW. WOULD HAVE ANY AND ADD TO THAT. A YES GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR IN AND MEMBERS JUST MARK FROM THE OUT JUST TO MY COLLEAGUE COMMENT THERE. THE POTENTIAL TO PROVIDE THEM CO TWO TO DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS IS SUBJECT TO A FAIR BIT OF ANSWER. BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT JUST FOR REVISING THROUGH THE- THAT THAT THAT IN FACT THROUGH MC TAX LIKE MY- AND IN. THE RIVER THE RIVER TACK AS WELL AS A THE KERR TAX LIKE THE IN FROM UNDER THE NEW RIGHT. SO THERE'S A TIE ISSUE THOSE REGULAR ARE TO BE FINAL. WITHIN THE NEXT MONTHS SO IF. THE REVISED SORT OF HUMAN BEING PRIOR TO THE- REGULATE TO BE A- PROVISION. BUT IT UNLIKELY OR THERE IS. A FAIR BIT OF THOSE THE UNCERTAIN AND FOR OF THE BILL OF THE OF THIS TO GET THE RIVER. HOW RETURN FOR THE BEFORE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE RIGHT. STOKES AS MY CALL MENTIONED THE. THAT THAT COULD BE AVAILABLE THAT ONE BILLION DOLLARS- SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE OR- IS THAT ARE WE SAYING IT'S NOT AVAILABLE ARE WE SAYING IT COULD BE AVAILABLE I MEAN EVERYTHING IS PRETTY UNCERTAIN. SO THE HELPFUL BUT- I GUESS I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S- COULD BE THERE. WE DON'T WANT IT TO BE THERE WE DON'T WANT TO USE IT OR DO WE WERE HOLDING THAT IN CASE WE HAVE TO USE IT BECAUSE A LOT OF THINGS THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT. WE'RE TRIGGERING IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AND NOT IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES. I'M NOT SURE IF THIS ONE BILLION. COULD BE AVAILABLE OR IT'S JUST NOT AVAILABLE. I CAN NOW PUT PROPS COMMENT TO- TO THE MEMBER ON ON THAT THAT QUESTION SO THE BUDGET PACKAGE DOESN'T- ASSUME THAT THAT THAT THE- THE STATE WOULD BE PURSUING THAT OPTION. SHOULD THE- SHOULD THE STATE'S SORT OF WISH TO AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HASN'T THAT- HASN'T CHANGED THE REGULATIONS YET IT WOULD BE OPEN TO THE STATE TO PURSUE AND- OUR- IF THE CURRENT REGULATIONS THAT ARE REGULATIONS WOULD APPLY WE DO THINK THAT THERE IS THE POTENTIAL. TO ACHIEVE ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS OF THE OF THE DECISION OF GEERAL FUND SAVINGS TO THE OPTION- IS NOT- IS NOT ELIMINATED BY THE LEGISLATURE BUDGET PACKAGE IS JUST SIMPLY- NOT ASSUME THAT THE- THE ADDITIONAL BE ADDITIONAL- GENERAL FUND SAVINGS WITH A CREW. I WOULD ADD SENATOR DORADO JUST TO REMIND US THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY PROPOSAL- DID NOT FACTORY IN IN SEAL TAX- REVENUE IF YOU WILL. WE HAD THE. PROPOSAL AT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AWAITING APPROVAL AND SO HE DIDN'T FACTORED IN- CALL THE NINETEEN HITS AND IT'S APPROVED AND SO AND SO WHAT THE SENATE DID PASSED WAS WHAT WE FELT WAS A MINOR ADJUSTMENT TO THE PROPOSAL THAT WOULD FALL WITH IN WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT APPROVED. THAT'S WHAT THE SENATE APPROVED IN AS YOU SEE AN AD WAS EXPLAINED BY THE LA L. IN THE FINAL. TWO PARTY DEAL- WE'VE TAKEN THAT EXPLICIT ASSUMPTION OUT. HOW CAN MEMBERS CAN RAISE THEIR MINDS TO BE RECOGNIZE I SEE DOCTOR PAN WHO WILL BE FOLLOWED BY SENATOR MORE LAW. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- JUST WANTED TO FIRST OF ALL. THANK YOU THANK THE ASSEMBLY- FOR A WORKING WITH THE SENATE'S IN- DEVELOPING- THIS- JOINT LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE CONSIDERING I BELIEVE- AND- MONDAY WHEN WE PASSED THE BUDGET I JUST WANT TO MAKE A COUPLE OF OBSERVATIONS SO FIRST OF ALL ON THE- COUNTY REALIGNMENT ASSISTANCE- AS CHAIR OF BUDGET SUB THREE YOU KNOW WE DEAL WITH A LOT OF THE- SOCIAL SERVICE PROGRAMS WHICH ARE GOING TO BE EVEN GREATER DEMAND AS RESULT. OF COVE IN NINETEEN AND ECONOMIC IMPACT WITH PEOPLE FORTUNATELY HAVING- LOST THEIR JOBS AND- REQUIRING PUBLIC ASSISTANCE A RECOGNIZING THAT A PORTION OF THAT OF COURSE IS ALSO BORN BUYER COUNTY SO WELL WE'RE LOOKING AT THE STATE BUDGET WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT ARE COUNTIES WHICH- UNDER REALIGNMENT- WE'RE DEPENDENT ON SALES TAX AND ANYONE IS. LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED TO US SALES AND- DURING THE PANDEMIC RECOGNIZE THOSE ARE WAY DOWN VEHICLE LICENSE FEES AS WELL WHICH OF COURSE OF YOU'D ANYONE LOOKED AT A- GONE TO A CAR DEALER WOULD RECOGNIZE THAT THAT'S WAY DOWN AS WELL THAT WE DO NEED TO STEP UP AND HELP OUT. I WOULD THOUGH ALSO MAKE NO WE ARE NOT MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS SO AS BUT I COUNTIES ARE BALANCING THEIR BUDGETS AND TRYING TO SERVE THE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE WHO DO HAVE NEEDS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WOULD- HOPEFULLY ARE COUNTIES WILL PRIORITIZE. FUNDING FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IT WOULD BE A SHAME IF DURING A PANDEMIC WE HAD CUTS TO PUBLIC HEALTH WHILE WE ARE TRYING TO FIGHT THIS PANDEMIC AND- IT'S SO IT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT- FOR OUR COUNTIES EVEN AS THEY ARE ALSO FACING THE ECONOMIC CHALLENGES THAT WE ARE FACING IS A STATE. THAT THEY PRIORITIZE ALSO FUNDING PUBLIC HEALTH- AS ACTUALLY THE LEADING PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCY THEY SHOULD BE SUPPORTING- TO DEAL JUST ENDEMIC- SO I THINK AS WE LOOK AT A REALIGNMENT ASSISTANCE I HOPE THAT SOME OF THAT ASSISTANCE BUT- WILL. ENSURE THAT OUR PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS- ARE SUSTAINED I REALIZE THE SHOULD HOPEFULLY GET ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING AS WELL- WE HOPE OUR THAT WILL HAPPEN BUT I. THAT WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO SEE CUTS THE PUBLIC HEALTH IS RESULT OF THAT. DEMI THE OTHER THING OUT ALSO MAKE NOTE AND I APPRECIATE THAT- WE DO NEED OUR STATE WORKERS TO HELP US OUT AS WERE FACING THIS- BUDGET DEFICITS- HERE. AS WELL BUT I WAS TO MAKE NOTE THAT HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE WON THE LOWEST RATIOS OF STATE WORKERS TO POPULATION- WE'VE ASKED OUR STATE WORKERS TO STEP UP. TO HELP OUT TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE FILED FOR UNEMPLOYMENT AND INTO THEIR STILL BACKLOGS BUT WE'VE MOVED PEOPLE OVER TO DO THAT. WE'RE ASKING STATE WORKERS TO NOW BECOME CONTACT TRACERS WITH THE GOVERNOR. ANNOUNCING TEN THOUSAND- CONTACT TRACERS BEING TRAINED. SO EVEN AS WE ARE ASKING OUR STATE WORKERS TO STEP UP. AND DO THINGS. WE ARE ALSO IN ITALY BECAUSE OF ARE. GOING TO BE CHALLENGED IN TERMS OF- ALSO POTENTIALLY TAKING. PAY CUTS AS WELL SO. I APPRECIATE THAT OUR PROPOSAL IS ASKING THAT THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS MOVE FORWARD THAT WE HAVE A NEGOTIATED APPROACH TO DOING THIS. BUT I ALSO DO I STAND UP AND SAY AND EXPRESS MY SUPPORT FOR OUR STATE WORKERS. AS WELL AS OUR COUNTY WORKERS WHO ARE. ACTUALLY THEIR JOB DEMANDS ARE GOING UP. THEY'RE GOING UP BECAUSE OF THIS PANDEMIC BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY MORE PEOPLE IN NEED. SO YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO FACE THE REALITY OF. OUR BUDGET AND WE HAVE TO PASS A BALANCED BUDGET. BUT DIE PRECIADO APPROACH AND I HOPE THAT- IN THE FINAL NEGOTIATIONS GOVERNOR'S. A NATION. OF THIS FACT THAT. ARE AS OUR COUNTY AND OUR STATE AFTER I NEED SUPPORT. THANK YOU. YOU US MORE LAW. BEING THANK YOU MATTER CHAIR. THANK YOU FOR THE OVERVIEW OF THE LEGISLATURE'S. BUDGET PACKAGE I'M ASSUMING THAT. THIS DOES NOT APPLY TO OUR FIRST TWO. AGENDA ITEMS AB SEVENTY FIVE AND SEVENTY SIX BECAUSE- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF. THE CURRENT YEAR'S BUDGET. BUT IT DOES APPLY IT A LITTLE BIT TO THE A. B. EIGHTY FIVE OR THIRD ITEM. WHICH IS ONE OF SEVERAL. OF THE BUDGET IS AT AS WHEN I PLAY. THAT FOR THE RECORD. GIVE ME ONE SECOND THIRD MORE LONG. THROUGH HAND-SIGNALS ACROSS THE ROOM OUR DIRECTOR OF THE SENATE BUDGET THE DEPARTMENT SAYS THAT YOU ARE CORRECT. THEN JUST- WANTED ADDRESS MAYBE. A COMMENT YOU MADE AT THE ON SET AND THAT WAS SAID THAT THIS BUDGET. OVERALL OF WOULD MINIMIZE HARMFUL CUTS AND I'M JUST CURIOUS WHAT THAT MEANS. MY POINT WAS IS THAT OUR GOAL IS TO TRY TO- MINIMIZE HARMFUL CUTS THE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS RECOGNIZING THE IMPACT A PUBLIC HEALTH AND ECONOMIC PANDEMIC HAS. DONE TO OUR STATE BUT IT CERTAINLY IS AN OUR GOAL TO PASS A BUDGET THAT EXACERBATES HARM MY STATEMENT WAS ALSO ON IN REFERENCE TO THIS BUDGET IN COMPARISON TO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. THE PROPOSED MAY REVISE THAT HAD A LONGER TRIGGER LISTED HAD A TRIGGER LIST OF CUTS THAT WOULD TO AFFECTS SOONER JULY ONE VERSES WHAT. ARE BUDGET BILL HAS PROPOSED TO REALLY KIND OF FLIP THE TRIGGER PROCESS- AND FUND THE PROGRAMS UP UNTIL THE POINT IF THE FEDERAL DOLLARS DON'T COMMAND THEN WE HAVE THE PLAN HOW TO BACK FILL IN OUR TRIGGER LIST IS- SHORTER. SO THAT'S MY POINT SO THEN ARE WE ANTICIPATING A V. RECOVERY IT JUST WHICH CAME DOWN LIKE ARE. A BIG ROCK INTO A INTO THE LAKE IS RESPECTING AT THE- TO COME RIGHT BACK HIS WERE USING RESERVES. AND ASSUMING REVENUES FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND IT WE'VE BEEN KIND OF ON AN UPWARD TRAJECTORY SO WE'RE NOT. LOOK I DON'T SEE. SOME KIND OF TURN DOWN FOR THE FOR THE STATE I JUST SEE THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IT. FOR THE WHAT WE CAN TO KEEP THINGS IN PLACE FOR THIS YEAR AND THEN WE CAN DISSIPATE BUT THERE WERE THAT THE ECONOMY JUST BOUNCES RIGHT BACK NO I. HI NOR ANY OF US OF THIS COMMITTEE- THAT NAIVE A SENATOR MORE LOT- WE KNOW THAT THE LA L. PRESENTED IN THEIR SPRING FINANCE LETTER IT'LL TWO VERSIONS AT EL AND A YOU RECOVERY- MISTER PECK WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND AT ALL THIS AND MORE LOT. EXPRESSED CONCERN. YEAH I CAN SAY THAT- I THINK THE E. YES AS- AS A MANAGER. SAID WE DID PROVIDE A- SPRING OUTLOOK WHICH INCLUDED A YOU IN AN L. SHAPED SCENARIO. NON AYE BUT I'M FAMILIAR WITH THAT. YEAH MISTER REDDICK- THE MAYBE I'LL ASK A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY HAS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PREPARED MULTI YEAR. BUDGETS TO ASSUME WHAT WE CAN EXPECT IF WE DON'T GT IT A QUICK ECONOMIC REBOUND WHAT IF THIS IS. NOT OF THE WHAT IF IT'S A HOCKEY STICK LIKE THE GREAT RECESSION WHERE WE HAD. A MASSIVE DROP AND THEN IT JUST WS SUCH A SLOW SLOW LONG CLIMB OUT. I AM JUST. WONDERING IF FOR. I'M CONCERNED MAYBE WORK WE'RE DEPLETING ALL OF OUR RESERVES AND HAVING. A ROW A MAYBE A HIGHER. WEIGHT ON FEDERAL FUNDING THEN WE SHOULD BE HAVING A WE'RE NOT ANTICIPATING PROPERLY FUTURE YEAR TRENDS AND THAT'S- WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. MAYBE MR PRESS ONE IF ON. MIGHT BE ABLE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION MADAM CHAIR. YEAH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU SENATOR MORE LOCK ON AT THE QUESTION THAT YOU RAISE TYPICALLY THAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND I GUESS WHAT YOU WOULD CALL MORE NORMAL TIMES WE HAVE ARE EXPECTED SCENARIO AND THEN WE HAVE RECESSION SCENARIO SASUKE SO TWO POSSIBLE WAYS IN WHICH THINGS CAN GO OF COURSE IN THIS SITUATION BY THE TIME WE PUT OUT OUR MAY REVISIONS FORECASTS THE ECONOMY WAS ALREADY IN RECESSION SO WHILE WE DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC. DIFFERENT SCENARIOS OF THE WAY THAT RECESSION CAN GO OUR ECONOMIC TEAM CERTAINLY LOOKED AT THAT AND WHAT THEY HAVE PROPOSED IS BASICALLY WHAT THEY VIEW AS THE MOST LIKELY SCENARIO GIVEN ALL THE FACTORS RELATED TO THE PACE OF RE OPENING ACTIONS BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE THE LATEST UNEMPLOYMENT DATA SO HOLD REFLECTED IN OUR ECONOMICS IN THERE AND YOUR POINT ABOUT THE POSSIBILITIES- THE ECONOMIC A SAX- THIS RECESSION AND THE COMMON NINETEEN PANDEMIC GOING ON FROM SOMETIMES YOU CAN SEE IN OUR OUR WORK THAT WE DO. SEE SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT. ACTS NOT ONLY THE NEXT YEAR BUT OVER THE MEAT TERM AND SO VALUES THE REVENUE THAT WE ARE PROJECTING. DON'T MATCH THE REVENUE THAT WE PROJECTED THIS TIME A YEAR AGO FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND WHEN IT COMES BASICALLY TO THE RESEARCH THAT YOU MENTIONED. IN THE NAY REVISION WE DIDN'T ANTICIPATE THAT FEDERAL FUNDING WE KNOW THAT HOW THAT WILL ULTIMATELY BE REFLECT. IN THE FINAL BUDGET WILL BE THE RESULT THAT WHATEVER THREE PARTY AGREEMENT TIMES BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY IN THE SENATE BUT CERTAINLY IN OUR PLAN- THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACT. OUT AS WELL AS THE STATE'S NEVER SERVED IN OTHER RESERVES THOSE WERE TO BE DRAWN DOWN OVER A PERIOD OF THREE YEARS RECOGNIZING BACKS IT IS LIKELY THAT EVEN IF WE MAKE A RELATIVELY. QUICKER RECOVERY THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE EXPECTING WE DO EXPECT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO SEE THE EFFECTS OF THIS RECESSION FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE THOROUGH INSTRUMENT MAYBE AS A FOLLOW UP- YOUR INCLUDING. TAX REVENUE. AS FROM. NINE MILLION OVER THREE YEARS BY MIND NINE BILLION SKEWS ME- I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT WE WOULDN'T BE RAISING TAXES BUT THE ONE EXAMPLE IN IN TODAY'S AGENDA UNDER A. B. EIGHTY FIVE IS THAT WE WOULD. NOT ALLOW THE UTILIZATION OF NET OPERATING LOSSES FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS. BEING AS A FORMER SWELLED. BEING A CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANT ACTIVE- YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE HIT NUMBER BY A LOCK DOWN OF THE ECONOMY. AND SO NOW THEY'RE NOT. CREATING REVENUES IN. THEY'RE GONNA HAVE LOSSES AND THE ONE WAY TO KIND OF RECOVER FROM THAT IS TO CARRY THIS FORWARD AND BENEFIT FROM THOSE DEDUCTIONS AND SO NEVER HITTING A SECOND TIME WHEN THE ECONOMY WAS SHUT DOWN. BY THE CITY AND I'M JUST WONDERING WHY WE WOULD TAKE THAT KIND OF APPROACH AS OPPOSED TO TRYING TO HELP BUSINESSES RECOVER AND THEN THEY WOULD GENERATE MORE BUSINESS MORE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN THEIR FORMALLY TAX REVENUE. YES ON THAT ISSUE ALL SPEAK BRIEFLY TO IT I ALSO HAVE A G. CHAMBERLAIN ON THE LINE AND I KNOW I ALSO WANT TO DEFER TO THE CHAIR- WHY NO- THAT BILL IS A LITTLE BIT LATER ON THE AGENDA BUT ALSO VERY QUICKLY. TWO POINTS ON THAT POINT I THINK THE FIRST IS THAT WE VERY MUCH VIEW THIS AS A TEMPORARY- AND THAT THIS WOULD BE SPURRED THIS CALENDAR YEAR AND THE NEXT TWO CALENDAR YEARS AND PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T HEARD THOSE LOSSES IN THE PAST WOULD BE ABLE TO USE THEM AFTER THAT AND IF ANY OF THOSE CREDITS- WERE TO BE EXPIRING IN THIS TIME PERIOD- THOSE THAT OPERATING LOSSES WOULD CARRY OVER FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME- BECAUSE OF THE SUSPENSION. THE SECOND POINT IS THAT THAT THIS IS VERY MUCH A TEMPORARY MEASURE- MEASURES SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THIS HAVE BEEN TAKING IN PREVIOUS RECESSIONS AND GIVEN THAT THE PRESSURES THAT WERE UNDER WE'RE HOPING THAT EVERYONE CAN STEP FORWARD IN A VERY TEMPORARY WAY AND THEN. WHAT HAS TO RECOVERY WAS ON- THOSE AT THESE NET OPERATING LOSS IS THE ABILITY TO USE THAT WILL BE RESTORED AND THEN THE THIRD POINT I'LL MAKE FINALLY IS THAT. THE WEEPING COLLUDED A SPECIFIC PROVISION IN OUR SO THAT THIS WOULD ONLY BE FOR TAXPAYERS AT WITH. ABOUT ONE DOLLARS WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT VERY SMALL BUSINESSES MOM AND POP TYPE ENTERPRISES DAY WOULD NOT BE PROHIBITED FROM USING THESE THAT OPERATE LOSSES THIS YEAR OR NEXT TO USE. OR ENTITIES THAT HAVE A BOB THE ONLY OR IS TO DO IT THAT IS OUR NEW BROUGHT BY CREAM IT I THE- CAN SUSPEND THEM USING LOSSES JUST THIS. SPORT AND THEN AS- BRAD ECONOMY RECOVERS. ABOUT RENTALS WILL BE ABLE TO USE CREDITS YOU CAN USE SO I GUESS I JUST WANT TO BE IN BUT THAT TO OUR TAX. CAN THEY PAY ARE SALARIES IT'S THEIR HARD WORK AND ARE MAKE THE HARM CAT. AND IT WOULD BE HELP. THAT THEY SEE THAT IT'S A SHARED. THAT MAYBE WE DO NEED TO ALSO MAY SOME HARMFUL CUTS AND THAT IT DOESN'T ALWAYS. ON THE SHOULDERS OF OUR TAXPAYERS AND THAT'S JUST AN OBSERVATION MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH. EIGHT AND TO BE CLEAR ARE YOU NOT I GUESS IN MY MIND I DON'T YOU KNOW SEPARATE THE TWO THOSE WHO- ARE ARE LOOKING TO UTILIZE- THE STATE PROGRAMS- OUR TAXPAYERS TO. AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO JUST BE CLEAR THAT IT'S NOT ONE GROUP VERSUS ANOTHER. THEY TO OUR TAXPAYERS AND THEY CONTRIBUTE TO THE GENERAL FUND AND BECAUSE OF THIS PANDEMIC ARE GOING TO NEED TO RELY ON THE SUPPORT FROM THE STATE. IT'S NOT TWO DIFFERENT GROUPS OF PEOPLE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE LET'S MOVE ON TO SENATOR STERN. AT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- TO THE TO THE STAFF FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK AND A COMPLETELY COMPRESSED TIME FRAME- I FIRST JUST WANTED. WHOLEHEARTEDLY ENDORSE THE SENATE'S APPROACHING THE CREATIVITY AND THE REFUSAL TO ACCEPT- CONSTRAINTS OF CERTAIN TIMING ON TRIGGERS HERE AND REALLY TRY TO SET OUR OWN PACE AND HOPEFULLY WASHINGTON STEPS UP BUT I THINK WE'VE GOT A REALLY TERRIBLE FRAMEWORK TO INTO OUR POLITICAL IMPASSE THAT. I WORRY WILL AMOUNT- TO THE U. S. SENATE FAILING TO ACT. I WOULD JUST WANTED TO ASK A SPECIFIC QUESTION THE WILD FIRE SUPPLEMENTS I NOTICED THAT WAS ONE OF THE KEY PROVISIONS IN AB SEVENTY FIVE BEFORE US. AND I IN TERMS OF TAKING CARE OF OUR OUR STATE AND COUNTY WORKERS AND THE PEOPLE WHO DO THE HARD WORK TO DO WITH OUR CRISES. APPRECIATE THAT THE BACKUP FOR BOTH OUR FOLKS A CAL FIRE AS WELL AS DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES WHO WERE. DOING THESE CRITICAL- RESPONSE CHECKS WHEN THE POWER WENT DOWN. HSS AND ALL OUR SOCIAL WORKERS HAD TO GO TO WORK AND MAKE SURE THE MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS- THAT WE DIDN'T LOSE THEM IN THE PROCESS- I NOTICED THOUGH A- A SUPPLEMENT OF I THINK TWENTY FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION. A TWO CARILLO YES- I WAS WONDER IF WE GET A LITTLE MORE DETAIL. ON THAT ITEM. WELL IT. REGARDING IS THIS IT THIS IS THE IT LOOKS TO BE SORT OF BACK FILL FOR ACTIVITY COSTS THAT HAVE ALREADY OCCURRED. BUT DO WE ALSO A FORWARD LOOKING BUDGET ITEM HERE. OR IS THIS JUST. SORT OF A BACK FILL OF PAST COSTS AND THEN WE REALLY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING. GOING AHEAD FOR THIS P. S. P. S. SEASON COMING UP. SENATOR STERN I THINK ON. THAT PARTICULAR QUESTION ALL ASK IF MY COLLEAGUE- BRIAN BROWN COULD WEIGH IN WITH. SOME SOME ADDITIONAL INSIGHT. IN MISTER BROWN BEFORE YOU BEGIN MEMBERS I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE YOU THAT THIS POINT WERE ASKING QUESTIONS OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BILL WE'RE GOING TO GET INTERNET INDIVIDUAL PRESENTATIONS ON EACH TRAILER BILL MAY WE DIFFER THAN MY QUESTION WILL JUST ACCEPT MY STATEMENTS A COMMON. GUT AND I'LL COME BACK TO THE TO RELOCATE WOMAN THANK YOU MY APOLOGIES ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ON THE OVERALL- ON DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SENATE AND LET'S SAY THE PACKAGE MR STERN ANY QUESTIONS ON THAT. NO JUST A GOOD LUCK WE HOPE WISH YOU WELL THIS WEEKEND THANK YOU SIR SENATOR NIELSEN YOUR MICROS UP AGAIN THESE ARE QUESTIONS ON- THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SENATE VERSION AND THE NEW LEGISLATIVE AGREEMENT. THE IS IT POSSIBLE THIS IS A QUESTION MISTER PECK IS IT POSSIBLE THAT IN THAT WE'RE NOT DEALING TOO MUCH WITH THE STRUCTURAL DEFICITS IN THIS BUDGET THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AN EXACERBATED PROBLEM IN THE FUTURE AS WE MOVE AHEAD. SENATOR NEAL SAID I THINK THAT- CERTAINLY IT IS POSSIBLE ARE OUT LOOKING COLLUDED THAT AND I BELIEVE- THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ALSO ESTIMATED THAT THERE S A STRUCTURAL COMPONENT TO THE BUDGET PROBLEM THIS YEAR. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE DO NOT EXPERIENCE A RECOVERY- NOTE THERE IS SOMEWHAT GREATER USAGE OF SOME OF THE STATE'S ONE TIME RESOURCES IN THE PACKAGE THAT WE'RE- CONSIDERING HERE TODAY AND IN THE EVENT THERE IS NOT A- YOU CAN N IT RECOVERY. OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS OR SO. IT'S LIKELY THAT. ADDITIONAL ONGOING SOLUTIONS WOULD NEED TO BE CONSIDERED- SO THAT SOMETHING FOR ORDER I THINK THE LEGISLATURE TO KEEP IN MIND. WELL I PERSONALLY AM CONFIDENT WE'RE GOING TO SEE A RECOVERY IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A STEEP ONE BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A- SLIGHTLY IN PLANNING ONE I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE BOUNCING BACK. BETTER WE WOULD CERTAINLY HOPE SO. BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT DOES LOOM OUT THERE AND A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE NOW IS GOING TO BE PREDICATED ON A RESURGENCE OF THE ECONOMY. AND REVENUES THERE FROM. AT. THANK YOU SIR SENATOR BAIL. MADAM CHAIR. I WOULD LIKE TO US ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE ON THE- REALIGNMENT FUNDS THAT IT'S- INDICATED- FOUR HUNDRED. I THINK IT'S FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. SENSE I WAS INVOLVED IN THE REALIGNMENT AND TWENTY OF TWENTY ELEVEN. AND THE REALIGNMENT AND TWENTY ELEVEN GAVE A PRIMACY IN THE ALLOCATION FORMULA A STELLAR SAID TIME TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND IT. PUT TO THE GROWTH FACTORS YEAH THE ATEGORY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT I DON'T REALLY SEE IN THE OTHER CATEGORIES. AND THE QUESTION I HAVE IS AFTER TEN YEARS AND AFTER ALL THE CHANGES IN PUBLIC SAFETY SOCIAL SERVICE MENTAL HEALTH AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT. THE HORRIBLE CUTBACKS IN HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES THAT WE HAVE IN THIS YEAR'S. ISN'T IT TIME TO RE LOOK AT THOSE FORMULAS OR LEASE LAYOUT COUNTIES TO HAVE SOME. FLEXIBILITY IN THE SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS THAT- WE HAVE IN THE TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT. A LOT OF PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT ARE. SCREAMING ABOUT HOW. THEY DON'T WANT THEY WANT CHANGES IN POLICE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND I THINK WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO RE LOOK AT THE REALIGNMENT FUNDS AND MAKE SOME SUBSTANTIAL CONTRIBUTION. TO WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE A PROGRESSIVE- APPROPRIATE AND IN THE INTEREST OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND INNER ANSWERS OF OUR HUMAN BEINGS IN OUR IN OUR STATE. THAT WILL OTHERWISE LOSE SERVICES. AND MENTAL HEALTH. SOCIAL SERVICE FOSTER CARE IN OTHER CATEGORIES SO I THINK. IT'S TIME TO RE LOOK. AT THE PROCESS AND TIMING OF THE FORMULA THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN TWENTY ELEVEN. SO OLD FORMULA THERE'S A LOT OF LAWS AND BEEN STRANGERS THE INITIATIVE IS A LOT OF CHANGE IN OUR SOCIETY. WE SHOULD REALLY LOOK AT IT. AND HAVE A LOOK AT IT OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW. THERE'S HORRIBLE CUTBACKS THEY'RE PROBABLY GONNA RESULT IN MANY. PROGRAMS TO BE CLOSE TO HUMAN SERVICES. SO WELL WE HAVE THIS FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. IN REALIGNMENT I WOULD I WOULD URGE THAT. IN SOME WAY WE LOOK AT THE REALIGNMENT PROGRAM. TO REACH US NOT NOT ADD TO THE SPENDING BUT LOOK AT THE SPENDING THAT WERE WORSE OUR SPENDING THAT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. AND POSSIBLY REALIGN THE MONEY TWO MORE IMPORTANT PRIORITIES THAT THE COMMUNITIES OF TODAY HAVE VERSES TEN YEARS AGO THANK YOU. THANK YOU WOULD FINANCE ARE LA L. LIKE TO ACCOMMODATE ALL. I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD TO ENSURE HER ALL RIGHT THANK YOU IT IN JUST A CLEAR FINE LOOKING AT THE ALEJO'S CHART- SENATOR BILL THE FOUR HUNDRED WOULD BE IN THE EVENT THAT THERE WERE. WE WERE NOT ABLE TO SECURE FEDERAL FUNDING WE HOPE TO INCREASE THAT AMOUNT BEYOND WHAT THE SENATE APPROVED AT SIX HUNDRED MILLION TO TAKE IT UP TO THE BILLION BUT AGAIN THE FOUR HUNDRED IS IN THE EVENT THAT THERE- WE RECEIVED NO FEDERAL FUNDING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENTS PER SHARE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM SENATOR SKINNER. I WANTED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE THAT- MY COLLEAGUE ON SEVEN FIVE BUDGET SUBFOSSIL. WE OBVIOUSLY IN SUB FIVE IS WAS IT A FIVE AS HIS BRAIN PRESENTED TO US THIS WAS NOT THE INCREASE TO- DEALING WITH THE- THE- BACK FILL OF REALIGNMENT WAS NOT ADDRESSED WE DID NOT HEAR IT WHEN WE HAD OUR SAID. AND EVEN IF WE HAD I WILL BE HONEST JUST BECAUSE OF THE CONDENSED NATURE THAT ALL OF US HAD TO EXPERIENCE WE WOULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN INTO THE GREAT DETAIL. THOUGH I THINK THAT NOT TO SAY I THINK. MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN JOSE'S POINTS HAVE MERIT THAT WE HAVE MADE GREAT CHANGES TO OUR TO MANY OPERATIONS AND POLICIES REGARDING. CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND THAT WHILE REALIGNMENT WAS A VERY SIGNIFICANT POLICY THAT WE ADOPTED. WE IN EFFECT WE IS THE LEGISLATURE LET GO OF OUR ABILITY TO HAVE MORE OVERSIGHT- AUTHORITY NOT OVERSIGHT WE ALWAYS CAN HAVE OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY OVER THE EXPENDITURE OF THOSE FUNDS WHICH WE PROVIDE TO THE COUNTIES. AND WE HAVE NOT HAD A SAY FOR EXAMPLE A DETAILED HEARING ON HOW THEIR PRACTICES NOW ME A LINE OR NOT A LINE WITH. I DO IT TRANSPORTATION- POLICIES THAT THE STATE HAS ENACTED. AND WE HAVE AN EFFECT REMOVED OURSELVES FROM THE ABILITY TO. ARE REALLY- EITHER TAKE BACK OR OR DIRECT THOSE FUNDS BY THE WAY THE ORIGINAL LEGISLATION WAS WRITTEN SO TO INCREASE THEM RIGHT NOW WHILE IT MAY BE APPROPRIATE I THINK IT IT DOES. NOT NECESSITATE A REAL HEARING AND PERHAPS AND ASKED TO LA- TO EVALUATE. WHAT THESE DIFFERENT CHANGES HAVE BEEN HAVE MADE SINCE REALIGNMENT AND WAYS THAT WE MIGHT POTENTIALLY RE LOOK OR RESTRUCTURING ALIGNMENT SO THAT IT IS OPTIMAL FOR ALL OF THE OBJECTIVES THAT WE HAVE SO I JUST WANT TO RAISE THAT IT IS NOT ALL THAT ISBEFORE US BUT GIVEN THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. A FOUR HUNDRED MILLION-DOLLAR POTENTIAL EXPENDITURE IT IS SIGNIFICANT AND UNDER THE CURRENT THE WAY THE- ORIGINAL LEGISLATION WAS WRITTEN WOULDN'T REALLY ALLOW US TO HAVE ANY FOR ANY FURTHER STORY OVER THOSE FUNDS IF WE PROVE THEM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR TO SKINNER CENTER NIELSEN I SEE YOUR MIKE IS BACK UP OKAY THANK YOU A FOLLOW UP MADAM CHAIR TO MY COLLEAGUES FROM BERKELEY AND THE SENATOR VALLEY ON REALIGNMENT. THERE'S A PORTION OF THIS BUDGET THAT IS RELATED TO CONTINUING REALIGNMENT OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND MAYBE HAVE MISTER VISION NOT THAN OR SOMEONE IN HIS TEAM COULD COMMENT. ONE OF THE FAILURES OF REALIGNMENT IS THAT WE- FITTED TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT A LOT OF THE AUTHORITIES THAT THE STATE HAD FORMALLY ACCEPTED. BUT I WOULD ARGUE WITHOUT SUFFICIENT FUNDING FOR THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO MEET THAT TEST IN IN THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL. THERE IS A REALIGNMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE THAT REMAINS THE REST OF WHAT IS AN WAS THE YOUTH AUTHORITY TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. BUT AS I LOOKED AT THE FIGURES AND I THINKTHAT THERE WERE SOME OF LIKE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION SAVINGS THAT WAS ATTRIBUTED MAYBE THEY CAN. ACTIVELY DETECT THOSE FIGURES. BUT WHEN WE LOOKED IN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WAS GOING TO BE TRANSFERRED TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO MAINTAIN THAT RESPONSIBILITY THAT WAS NOW BEING AS SOON BY THEM THERE WAS A GREAT DISCREPANCY. AND PROBABLY UNDERSTATED BECAUSE THE MISSION OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM IS ALL REHABILITATION THAT REQUIRES A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE REHABILITATIVE RESOURCES AT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL TO ACCOMMODATE THIS POPULATION. SETTLEMENT MAYBE FINANCE COULD THE COMMENT ON THAT DISCREPANCY AND HOW THEY SEE THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT WILL BE ABLE TO ASSUME THIS BURDEN TO HOUSE AND TO REHABILITATE THOSE PARTICULAR. WHAT WERE FORMALLY CALLED WARDS. MR THIS ONE OFTEN ON YOU OR ONE OF YOUR COLLEAGUES. YES I'LL SPEAK I DON'T HAVE MY COLLEAGUES WHO SPECIALIZE- ON THOSE ISSUES THAT DIRECTLY ON THE LINE RIGHT NOW ALL CD RE BRIEFLY THAT WE HAD INCLUDED A NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS IN THE NAY REVISION BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT OUR TEAM IS AN ACTIVE CONVERSATIONS ON THIS ISSUE IN PARTICULAR- WITH LEGISLATIVE STAFF IN TERMS OF WHAT WILL BE REFLECTED. IN A THREE PARTY AGREEMENTS SO UP CHINA WILL LAST ALL BUT YOU AND I KNOW THOSE CONVERSATIONS INCLUDING ON SOME ISSUES THAT YOU RAISED ARE HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS BEFORE WE MOVE INTO HEARING FROM FINANCE ON EACH OF THE TRAILER BILLS. INDIVIDUALLY. SEEN NONE OF A WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM. GOING TO START WITH THE FIRST TRAILER BILL FOURTH AB SEVENTY FIVE THE SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS BILL I'D NOTE THAT- FINANCE WILL PRESENT THE BILLS AND THEN BE ON HAND ALONG WITH ELLIE- TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ON THE SERVICE WHEN NOTHING CAN YOU START PLEASE WITH DESCRIBING. THE FIRST TRAILER AB FIVE. YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND SERVICE FIRST BILL IS AB SEVENTY FIVE AND THIS IS A SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS BILL FOR THE CURRENT YEAR WITH THAT WERE IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY. AND THIS IS FOR. COSTS BEYOND THE RESOURCES THAT WERE PROVIDED IN THE TWENTY NINE TEAMS BUDGET ACT- SO THERE'S SEVERAL DIFFERENT EXPENDITURES- IN THIS TALE- THEY ADDED TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. I WILL JUST DESCRIBE A COUPLE OF THEM AND THEN HAPPY TO TAKE- ANY QUESTIONS ON THAT SO FIRST-% AS CENTER STORE MENTIONED THERE ARE A NUMBER OF EXPENDITURES IN HERE IN TERMS OF AN ANTICIPATED COSTS RELATED TO WILDFIRES INCLUDING BOTH THE CAMPFIRE FROM TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AS WELL AS TWENTY NINETEEN WILD FIRES AND RELATED PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF A SENSE OF COMMUNITY RESILIENCY AND SO ALSO SPECIFICALLY I JUST BECAUSE SENATOR STERN HAD. HIGHLIGHTED THE SPECIFIC POINT- WHEN IT COMES TO THE TWENTY FOUR MILLION FOR A WE ASKED. THAT WAS A COMBINATION OR THAT IS A COMBINATION PASSED ADDITIONAL COPS AT THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER AND REGIONAL CENTERS OUR TASK BY WE ASK FOR. RESPONDING TO PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF THE BENCH BUT ALSO FOR THE RESPONSES TO THE WILD FIRES THEMSELVES AND THIS INCLUDES- FIRE RESPOND TO IS. FOR THE STATE FOR REIMBURSEMENTS TO OTHER JURISDICTIONS AND LOCAL ENTITIES THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM THAT THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. AS WELL AS REIMBURSEMENT FOR OTHER STATES OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA. FOR THE MUTUAL AID THAT WE DO HAVE WITH THAT SO WHEN THEY ARE COMING IN. TO HELP US. AND THIS IS SIMILAR TO HOW. YEAH STATE SIX THREE. OUR MUTUAL A AGREEMENTS ONE GOING TO HELP OTHERS. I'M SURE THERE NUMBER DIFFERENT AND THAT'S ONE OF THEM RELATED TO BUT THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN WILDFIRE SEASON AND WE KNOW THAT SOME OF THESE EXPENSES. COSTA SCHOOL YEARS WE WENT THROUGH THIS PROCESS. LOOKING TO MAXIMIZE REIMBURSEMENT BUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE DONE IN OUR CONTINUING TO DO. SO THESE ARE EXPENDITURES TECHNICAL OUR GENERAL SIGN ON TOP OF WHATEVER REIMBURSEMENTS THAT WERE ABLE TO RISK. THERE AND BURR ODDS ABA. ARE OTHER MANDATE SPENDING- THAT WE BELIEVED WAS IMPORTANT OR NECESSARY TO INCLUDE IN THIS STILL UNCLEAR. SHE'S RELATED TO CDC ARE OPERATED SOME CAL FIRE EXPENDITURES FOR A SETTLEMENT THAT COULD NOT BE STORED WITH EXISTING RESOURCES AS WELL AS CDSA AND THE STAIRS I'M SO THEIR NUMBER DIFFERENT ISSUES HERE- THEY CROSS NUMBER OF UNITS I'M HAPPY TO HELP WITH ANY QUESTIONS THAT I CAN AND IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT I CAN ANSWER DIRECTLY HERE. ALL MAKES TO GET BACK TO YOUR OFFICE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU SENATOR STERN ANY FOLLOW UP TO THE- I APPRECIATE THE CLARIFICATION AT AND I'M I'M JUST WONDERING SINCE WE SORT OF HAD. THE SORT OF ON UNANTICIPATED OVERAGES OR MAYBE A GAP IN OUR ABILITY TO GET FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT DO WE AND WE ANTICIPATE THE SAME ISSUE COMING AGAIN THIS THIS COMING P. S. P. S. SEASON. JUST WONDERING HOW WE SORT OF DONE THE FUTURE ANTICIPATION ACOSTA. YES BASICALLY ON DAYS WHEN IT COMES TO THE YEAR TO CALM EVEN THOUGH A NUMBER OF AREAS OF THE BUDGET- WE PROPOSED CUTS FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACTS. FOR PS PS OUR COMMUNITY POWER RESILIENCY WERE INCLUDING ANOTHER SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR AD THAT ANTICIPATED EXPENDITURES IT'S OF COURSE IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHETHER THAT'S GOING TO BE SUFFICIENT. TO COVER THESE TYPES OF EXPENSES IT DEPENDS ON WHAT KIND OF WILDFIRE SEASON THAT WE HAVE. BUT THAT'S WHAT WE'VE INCLUDING THE BUDGET AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE HE'S AN EVEN AS WE WERE SCRUTINIZIG. EVERY AREA OF THE BUDGET THAT WE DID INCLUDE THAT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THAT POSSIBILITY. THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION AND I WOULD JUST URGE IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF THAT BUDGET. FOR BOTH LOCAL AND STATE EXPENDITURES THAT. WE DON'T JUST RELY ON DIESEL POWER GOING FORWARD WE THOUGHT WE SAW SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTING DECISION FROM THE P. YOU SEE YESTERDAY AUTHORIZING- AND ALL THESE ALL APPROACH. FOR THE P. JEANNIE TERRITORY FOR MEETING THIS SEASON'S. A P. S. P. S. ISSUES AND I'M I'M JUST HOPING THE STATE CAN TRY TO BE. A BIT PROGRESSIVE AND REALLY TRY TO EXHAUST ALL ARE CLEAN ENERGY OPTIONS FIRST IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR THE INDULGENCE AND THANK YOU MISTER VISWANATHA ON FOR YOUR YOUR DILIGENCE HERE. THANK YOU SENATOR NIELSEN FOLLOWED BY SENATOR Y. KOWSKI. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- BUT I'D LIKE TO THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR THE FIRE RESPONSE TO THAT TRAGIC FIRE ON PARADISE AND THE RICH IN BUTTE COUNTY. THE BEEN VERY ATTENTIVE TO US UP THERE AND VERY HELPFUL TO US AND I CAN ATTEST TO THAT THE COMMUNITY IS COMING BACK. THE TRAGEDY REMAINS AT THAT COMMUNITY. FORMALLY WAS TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND. AND POPULATION IT IS NOW SEVEN. AND MAY BE DECLINING. AND AS PART OF THAT ISSUE. THERE IS THE SECOND YEAR FUNDING FOR THE- MAINTENANCE OF THE PARADISE IRRIGATION DISTRICT. AND I THANK BOTH THE FIT IS A WILL ASSEMBLY DID NOT ACT NOR DID THE SENATE FILL IT LOOKS LIKE THAT SECOND YEAR FUNDING WILL BE PROVIDED THE POINT THAT I MUST MAKE REGARDING THAT. IF IT IS NOT PROVIDED. THAT DISTRICT. WILL COLLAPSE. AND THAT IS THE WATER SUPPLY FOR THE WHOLE AREA UP THERE AND WITHOUT WATER THEY CANNOT COME BACK IN FACT THE SEVEN THOUSAND POPULATION WILL EVEN DIMINISH SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND I WOULD ENTREAT US TO KEEP AN EYE THAT THAT DOES HAVE THE SECOND YEAR FUNDING TO KEEP THAT IRRIGATION DISTRICT GOING WELL IT THEN ENDS UP HOPING TO. HAVE SOME MORE CUSTOMERS. AND ALSO TO THANK. THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR FOR SENSITIVITY TO OUR COUNTY FAIRS. PEOPLE LOOK AT THE FAIRS ARE JUST A WONDERFUL ENTERTAINMENT AND SUMMER. BUT THESE FACILITIES ARE USED YEAR ROUND BUT MOST PARTICULARLY THEY ARE USED FOR DISASTERS AS STAGING AREAS FOR AIR DISASTERS THERE WAS A CONSIDERATION. LAST YEAR TO. MAKE THESE FACILITIES AVAILABLE FOR HOUSING HOMELESS POPULATIONS AND I ARGUED VERY VOCIFEROUSLY AGAINST THAT BECAUSE IF THERE ARE HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AND RESIDING. WE CANNOT REMOVE THEM WHEN YOU HAVE A CRISIS AS WE OFTEN DO WITH FIRES AND FLOODS THE CHATTER OF EARTH QUAKES TO THESE ARE STAGING AREAS SO THAT PART OF THE BUDGET IS VERY WELCOMING VERY APPRECIATE. THANK YOU A MOVING ON TO SENATOR WORK ASKING. OF SERVICE MR THIS WAY OFF AND FINANCE HI I THINK I WILL RESPECTFULLY. NOT DISAGREE BUT SEPARATE MYSELF FROM THE- THE GENTLEMAN FROM- TO HAMMOCK COUNTY IS I SEE THAT AB SEVENTY FIVE IS JUST. ATRUE UP THIS IS LAST YEAR'S BUDGET AT THIS CURRENT YEAR'S BUDGET AND WE WERE SHORT ON FIRE FUNDS WE HAD TO REIMBURSE- BUT THE FORTY MILLION OR FORTY POINT THREE MILLION FROM GENERAL FUND SITS. THIS COULD GO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF THE NAGRA CULTURE. IS SIMPLY GO TO PAY FOR CLOSING DOWN THE FAIRS THROUGH JUNE OF THIS YEAR I MEAN THE FINANCE IN THE CASE THAT THE FEARS OF LOS NINETY EIGHT MILLION THROUGH THIS FISCAL YEAR. AND A GOOD TO GIVEN FORTY THREE MILLION BECAUSE I GUESS THAT'S WHAT THE STATE'S. ANSWER IS BUT PLAN AS I UNDERSTAND IT IS AT ALL THE MANAGERS ARE MERELY FIRE FROM ALL THE- SEVENTIES FAIRS. NEXT MONTHS WILL BE TO GET RID OF ALL THE IN THE EIGHTIES. AND THERE'S NO. SUGGESTION THAT IS THAT JUST THE END OF THE END OF THE GAME AND I'M WORRIED ABOUT THERE'S TALK ABOUT USING THE FIGURES AS AS LOCATIONS WHEN WE HAVE EMERGENCIES WHETHER THEIR FIRE THEIR FLOOD AND ANYTHING SO WE'RE GETTING RID OF ALL THE LOOKS LIKE THE GAME PLAN IS TO GET RID OF EVERYBODY. WE'VE GOT WE'RE HAVING A DISCUSSION ON WHETHER WE SHOULD HAVE STATEWIDE BEDDING AND THE ADMIN. OF THE AUTHORS SPECIFIC WE ARE NOT ALLOWING FEARS TO TAKE BETS ON SPORTS GAMES WHICH MIGHT HELP THEM MEET MEET SOME OF THE YEARLONG EXPENSES THAT THEY HAVE SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS. WHAT HAPPENS AND THE ONE WITH THE FAIRS BY. AND WHAT IS THE PLAN THAT FINANCE AS FOR THE ASSISTANCE FOR THIS THIS A PARTNER THAT WE HAVE. THE SERVICE WHEN OFFICE. YES SO ON THIS ISSUE AND YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT- SENATOR WHITE HOUSE YOU THAT THIS IS NOT A POLICY PROVISION IN THIS BILL THIS IS SIMPLY THE COST THAT WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE OBLIGATED TO UNDERTAKE. AS THE STAIRS THAT ARE STRUGGLING I TAKE PART IN THE WHITE HOUSE PROCESS WHICH WE KNOW IS VERY PAINFUL AND THAT WHICH ARE YOU DESCRIBE WELL I THINK RIGHT NOW THE PLAN THERE ARE DISCUSSIONS ON THIS FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND WILL CONTINUE TO. DO YEAR- AND SO WE WANT TO WORK YOU IN TERMS DEVELOPING AN APPROACH FORKS TRANSITION FOR MANY OF THESE DIFFERENT SITES- AND IT'S POSSIBLE THAT SUPPORTING. SOME PROPERTIES MAY BE NECESSARY FOR EMERGENCY OPERATIONS- SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ARE THINKING ABOUT A LOT IT'S OBVIOUSLY IN THE CONTEXT OF A VERY DIFFICULT THAT BUDGET SITUATION WHERE POINTING RESOURCES ANYWHERE HAS TO BE WITH THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF SCRUTINY BUT BUT THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE CERTAINLY AWARE OF- BUT STILL BACK TO THE ORIGINAL POINT. IT'S NOT IT'S STILL THERE STILL IS SIMPLY WITH THE LAYOFFS THAT ARE. EXPECTED TO COME IN THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS AND MONTHS MAKING SURE THAT THE COST TO PAY FOR THOSE EXPENSES RELATED TO- ADDITIONAL. UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE RELATED EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE LAYOFFS ARE I'M- A TIME THAT NEEDS TO BE PAID- THAT THE MONEY IS IN THE BUDGET FOR THE- IN ADDITIONAL. THAT ARE MORE LAW. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- THE SECOND ITEM. IS FOR NINE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN THE GENERAL FUND TO AUGMENT THE TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET. FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION FOR THEIR NEW FACILITY IN STOCKTON US IS A MEMBER OF SEVEN FIVE I DON'T RECALL DISCUSSING THIS PARTICULAR. EVENT I'M SURE WE DID BUT- SINCE IT WAS THE FACILITY WHICH WAS RECENTLY CONSTRUCTED IS THIS IS THIS A CONSTRUCTION DEFECT IN. IS THE STATE DOING ANYTHING- IN REGARDS TO. CONTACTING HER AT ADDRESSING THIS MATTER WITH THE CONSTRUCTION FIRM GENERAL CONTRACTOR ANY OF THE- PARTIES INVOLVED. MR THIS ONE OFTEN. I WANT TO CLARIFY SENATOR MORE LIKE IS THIS FOR CAN YOU CLARIFY YOU SAID NINE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS STUFF WHICH WHICH ACILITY WHICH I WANNA MAKE SURE I GOT THE RIGHT AND REFORM I'M LOOKING AT ITEM NUMBER TWO OF YOUR SIX COMPONENTS FOR THE OVERALL APPROPRIATION OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MILLION- IT STATES THAT. THE FACILITY AND STOCKTON HAD LEGIONELLA BACTERIA WATER SYSTEM HAD TO BE FIXED AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A BRAND NEW FACILITY THAT WAS JUST RECENTLY CONSTRUCTED SO I'M- CURIOUS IF THIS WAS A DEFECT THAT. TO BE ADDRESSED MAYBE. A IN A- EITHER LEGAL MANNER OR OR AT LEAST HAVE SOMEONE STEP UP- THAT THAT THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS OCCURRING AT THIS FACILITY. YES THIS IS FOR REMEMBER MEDIATION AT THAT WE CAN NOW- AT THAT FACILITY AND BASICALLY- OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT THE WATER USE OF THE FACILITIES WAS ACTUALLY LAST THAN WHAT WAS INCLUDED IN THAT DESIGN PLANS AND SO WHEN THERE WAS A SLOWER FLOW OF WATER. THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE GREATER POSSIBILITY OF THE GROWTH OF BACTERIA AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS SO I KNOW THAT CITY SEE OURS TAKING OUR CLOSER LOOK AT THIS AND THAT THIS FUNDING IS FOR IMMEDIATE REMEDIATION- BUT IT'S ACTUALLY NOT NOT TO SOLVE THE OVERALL ISSUE. AND SO THE WE DO ALSO HAVE- BE KEY IN OUR BUDGET PROPOSALS- WHEN IT COMES TO BROADER REMEDIATION EFFORTS THAT ARE NEEDED TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BUT WHEN IT COMES TO SOME OF THE SPECIFIC OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND- YOU KNOW WHATEVER DRIVERS TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T. GET YOU WANT. GREAT MAYBE THIS FROM. CA REMIND OF. WHETHER OR NOT THIS WAS DISCUSSED OR MAYBE COULD BE ON THE AGENDA IN FUTURE MEETINGS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU SENATOR PAN. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- AT. ONCE OR FOLLOW UP ON SOME COMMENTS ABOUT THE FARE MUCH THANK- SEVERAL CASKEY FOR BRING THIS UP- NO CAL EXPO IS CURRENTLY A SITE FOR BOTH- SHELTERING SOME OF THE HOMELESS- HERE IN SACRAMENTO REGION WE'RE DOING TESTING HERE- CLEARLY TO REVENUES FROM- YOU KNOW WITH CANCEL THE STATE'S SHARE THE COUNTY FAIR- AND- BY THE WAY IT'S ALSO STATE AGENCIES SO IT'S EXPENSES ARE ACTUALLY HIGHER BECAUSE OF STATE REQUIREMENTS. I WOULD POINT THAT OUT. SO THE PERSON OUT SPENCE'S ARE HIGHER BECAUSE OF CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS STATE IMPOSED ON CAL EXPO BECAUSE IT IS A STATE AGENCY. SO I THINK IT BEHOOVES THE STATE TO- AT LEAST- AND LOOKING AT CAL EXPO WHILE EXPECTING CAL EXPO. IN THE PAST TO SUSTAIN ITSELF OFF REVENUES FROM ACTIVITIES THAT WE CANNOT DO ANYMORE- TO AT LEAST HELP OUT WITH THE INCREASED EXPENSES RELATED TO. THE BEING A STATE AGENCY AND IN ADDITION TO THAT RECOGNIZE THAT. THE STATE USES THIS AS A STAGING AREA FOR ALSO EMERGENCY RESPONSE SO- BY LAYING OFF ALL THE WORKERS THERE. THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE CALYX BUT WILL NOT BE THERE FOR THE STATE WHEN THE STATE EXPECTS SAID. SO WE GOT THE SIZE THE SOMETHING THAT STATE ONCE IT'S A STATE AGENCY. OR OR NOT AND- I HOPE THAT- RECOGNIZING ALL THE ACTIVITIES THAT TAKE PLACE THERE THAT SUPPORT THE STATE. AND THE FACT THAT STATE AGENCY MEANS THAT DESERVES OUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. ANY COMMENT FROM FINANCE ELIO. UNDER STATE YES WE WILL- WE WILL TAKE THAT FEEDBACK THANK YOU. CENTER MELENDEZ. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST WANT TO GO BACK TO THE COMMENTS- OF MY COLLEAGUE MARIN COUNTY RELATING TO THE STOCKTON FACILITY. IF I HIRE SOMEONE TO COME IN A REPLACE THE PLUMBING IN MY HOME. AND THE CONTRACTOR COMES IN AND PERFORMS THE WORK IN IT DOESN'T PERFORM THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO I DON'T THEN. ASK THE CITY TO PICK UP THE TAB FOR MAKING THE NECESSARY- FIXES SO I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING IN THE COMMENTS FROM THE ALLEY SUGGESTING THAT. THE CONTRACTOR WAS GOING TO BE HELD RESPONSIBLE ON WHETHEROR NOT THE WATER FLOW WAS WHAT THEY THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE THAT IS ALL PART OF THE DESIGN AND PLANNING PROCESS WHEN YOU DO A LARGE PROJECT LIKE THIS. SO FOR ME IT GOES BACK TO THE CONTRACTOR AND I JUST I NEED SOME MORE CLARIFICATION FROM- THE LA IS OFFICE. AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE GOING TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE BECAUSE THE TAXPAYERS SHOULD NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR CONTRACTORS FOR WHICH IS YOU KNOW HOW I'M DOING THIS. SO YOU. I'M LOOKING FOR A RESPONSE FROM BOTH ACTUALLY OKAY. SO MISTER THIS ONE OFTEN. YES THAT THAT FUNDING IS FOR THE IMMEDIATE BASICALLY EMERGENCY REMEDIATION EFFORTS THAT HAVE TO TAKE PLACE ONCE THIS PROBLEM WAS DISCOVERED TO PREVENT ANY FURTHER ATTACKS OR INJURIES THAT WHEN IT COMES TO THOSE UNDERLYING ISSUES I. DO WANT TO CHECK WITH OUR TEAM AND MAKE SURE THAT I HAVE THE RIGHT DETAILSFOR YOU IN TERMS OF HOW THIS HAPPENED. NO I AND I HEARD THE RESPONSE- THAT YOU MADE EARLIER BY. IS THERE GOING TO BE AN EFFORT TO THEN TRY TO RECOUP THOSE FUNDS FROM THE CONTRACTOR. BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS IS A CONTRACTOR ERROR TO ME SO I UNDERSTAND THEY WANT TO FIX THE PROBLEM RIGHT NOW THAT'S IMPORTANT TO PEOPLE'S HEALTH BUT WILL WILL WE GET THAT MONEY BACK FROM. FOR THE TAXPAYERS. I WILL FALL DIRECTLY WITH YOUR OFFICE ON THAT I NEED TO CHECK WITH OUR TEAM OKAY THANK YOU. COMING FROM LA L. SORT OF BORED LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- CASES LIKE THIS THE STATE IS ABSOLUTELY FREE TO ATTEMPT TO- SEEK COMPENSATION FROM THE PARTIES THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE IN THIS CASE- IT'S SOMEWHAT UNCLEAR AT THIS POINT WHO WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT PART OF THE ISSUE. IS THAT THE DESIGN OF THE FACILITY WAS SUCH THEM SO LARGE AND THE PIPES PIPING WAS SO LONG. THAT WATER ENDED UP STAYING IN CERTAIN PLACES FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME LEADING TO THE PROLIFERATION OF THE BACTERIA SO THAT WE NEED TO BE CRITICAL FOR THE STATE ND THE DEPARTMENT TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT DESIGN AND TO ASSESS WHETHER OR NOT IT HAS- YOU KNOW THE LEGAL OPTION OF PURSUING COMPENSATION BUT IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT. IS WORTH LOOKING INTO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. ON THE FIRST TRAILER BILL AB SEVENTY FIVE. SEEN NO ADDITIONAL MIKE SO LET'S MOVE ON TO- AB SEVENTY SIX. WITH SERVICE WHEN OFTEN VIA AND AGAIN THIS IS EDUCATION FINANCE AB SEVENTY SIX. YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR ON EIGHTY SEVENTY SIX- THIS IS EDUCATION FINANCE RELATED TO AT PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT AND FUNDING FOR K. TWELVE SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES AT THE ACTUAL PACKAGE FOR THE COMING YEAR THE BUDGET YEAR- CONTINUES TO BE NEGOTIATED BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR AND MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE. I JUST WANNA KNOW TWO ITEMS OF NOTE THAT ARE IN THIS STILL FOR YOU- THIS FIRST IS THERE CHIU DEFERRALS I'VE CAGE FALL FUNDING AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE FUNDING FROM THE CURRENT YEAR TO THE BUDGET YEAR AND THAT'S ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FOR K. TWELVE FUNDING AS WELL AS THREE HUNDRED THIRTY NINE DOLLARS IN KEEPING COLLEGE FUNDING. AND SO THESE EXPENDITURES THAT WERE ORIGINALLY AT NINETEEN- BUDGET ACTS WILL BE DEFERRED INTO NEXT YEAR AND THEN THE SECOND ITEM OF NOTE IS AN APPROPRIATION OF A LITTLE OVER FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND THIS IS FOR SATELLITE MAINTENANCE PAYMENTS- TO SCHOOLS BASED ON PROPOSITION EIGHTY EIGHT. FROM THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND- I HAVE ALSO ON THE LINE WITH ME JESSICA HOLMES SANDERS FORGET STANDS IS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THAT WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER THEM WHEN IT COMES TO THE SPECIFIC. EXPENDITURES THANK YOU QUESTIONS MEMBERS ON TRAILER BILL. CENTER MORE LAW. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'M JUST CURIOUS- IF I COULD GET A LITTLE MORE DETAIL WHITE WIRE WE DIFFER IN. A PAYMENT WE'RE WE'RE SHIFTING AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT I CAN EXPLAIN THIS CLEARLY. A SERVICE FOR NOTHING. YES THESE ARE- DEFERRALS ARE OFTEN HAVE HAPPENED BEFORE BY THE STATE AND WHEN WE ARE IN CIRCUMSTANCES SIMILAR TO WHAT WE ARE TODAY WHAT COMES TO THE SPECIFICS OF HOW THE SMALL OPERATE I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE JUST A HOMES. FOR THE- ARE YOU TO FIND DEFERRAL THIS ALONE. HIS HOME. THANK YOU IS MORE LAX SO THE WAY THAT THE DEFERRAL WORKS IS GENERALLY SPEAKING. PRIVATE SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES IN THE MONTH OF JUNE SO THIS THIS MONTH TO CLAMOR TO KILLER TOWARDS THE END OF THE MONTH AND WHAT E ARE PROPOSING IN ORDER TO ALLOW. THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEED TO BE FUN MINIMUM LEVEL AND ITS RECORD CLOSING. HAVE THAT PAYMENT GO OUT AT THE BEGINNING OF JUNE TO JULY DEFERRAL AND IN THIS CASE IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO THAT. MISS HOMES YOU FOR A POST JUST FOR A MOMENT TO JUST RESTATE THAT LAST SECTION OF YOUR ANSWER PLEASE. COLLEGE EYES. TO WHAT WOULD OTHERWISE YOU KNOW COLLEGE JUNE TO JULY DEFERRAL SO WE'RE JUST PROVIDING TE SAME PAYMENT THAT WOULD OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE PROVIDED BUT IN JULY AND- SO IF I WERE TO GO BACK TO PRIOR YEARS I SEE SIMILAR. MOVEMENTS SO THIS IS NOT SOMETHING NEW OR UNIQUE JUST BECAUSE OF MISTER RESPONSE ON SAID THIS WE DO THIS IN. THESE KINDS OF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS I'D LIKE TO BE A SURE THAT WE DO THIS EVERY YEAR. WE DON'T DO THIS EVERY YEAR BUT WE HAD WE DID DO THE SEVERAL TIMES DURING THE LAST RECESSION. SO IT'S OKAY ALI BUT THERE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ON THIS TRAILER BILL. SEEING NONE LET'S GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHTY FIVE REGARDING REVENUES MR THIS ONE OFTEN. ON ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHTY FIVE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT REVENUE ITEMS IN THIS TALE I'LL JUST TOUCH ON SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE FIRST REALLY OPERATING LOSSES AND I KNOW THAT WE HAD A DISCUSSION EARLIER IN THE HEARING ON WHAT SENATOR MORE LOCK IN SOME OF THE QUESTIONS RAISED. BUT BASICALLY AT AS THE COST THIS PROPOSAL WOULD SUSPENDED THE USE OF NET OPERATING LOSSES FOR TAXPAYERS WITHIN THE BOTTOM ONE MILLION DOLLARS. THREE YEARS FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY YEAR THREE TO TWENTY TWENTY TWO YEAR ON AND ANYBODY- WHO IS. THE ABILITY TO USE THAT OPERATING LOSS FOR THOSE THREE YEARS WELL RECEIVED A CARRY OVER A PERIOD AS WELL TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN USE THEM. THE SECOND. NEW ITEM OF NOTE THAT THAT WAS IN OUR MY REVISION- BUT NOW WITH SOME ADJUSTMENTS. IS A TOP ON BUSINESS INCENTIVE CREDITS THESE WOULD BE CAPPED PERSON WERE BEARD OF TIME FOR THREE YEARS. I KNOW. TWO EIGHT BUSINESS. OF CRAP BACK BE USED WAS DID. SOLELY BECAUSE OF THIS LOCATION FORTY THREE YEARS THERE WOULD BE A CARRYOVER PERIOD AS WELL AND SO THOSE TWO PROVISIONS TOGETHER ARE ESTIMATED TO RAISE. A LITTLE BIT OVER FOUR BILLION DOLLARS NEXT YEAR AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL- FINDS. IT USED AS CREDITS BECAUSE OF THOSE PROVISIONS. WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE THEM IN FUTURE YEARS SO THIS IS SIMPLY A STAT. EVERYBODY'S DOING THEIR PART THAT MEASURE SIMILAR TO THIS HAVE BEEN UNDER. IN PAST RECESSION. AND MAKE SURE THE STATE GENERATE SOME ADDITIONAL REVENUE IN A WAY THAT MAKES SENSE AND THAT IS THERE. ANY TO THAT THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THE OTHER ITEMS OF NOTE THAT I WANT TO MENTION- THE FIRST IS THE EXTENSION FOR THE CRIER. FILM TAX CREDIT OF THAT PERIOD SIX NINE YEARS. THE SECOND IS A PART. THAT WE ALL INSURE AN ARM REPLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT CAR DEALERS ARE REMAINING SALES. TO THE STATE AND THEN IN ADDITION TO THAT WE ALSO HAVE PROPOSED. TO BE EXAM. ON SALES FOR. DIAPERS AND MEN'S HYGIENE PRODUCTS FOR. AT UNTIL TWENTY TWO THREE. I'M AS WELL AS A PER. THAT THE ADMIN. HAD ENGINE. TO PROVIDE AN EXAM. FOR THE LLC THAT WE HOPE WILL AN- UP OVER SOME OF BARRIERS TO START BUSINESS JUST. EACH GIVE ME. TIME THAT WERE RIGHT NOW. SO THOSE SOME OF THE- ARE BETTER HE- FELT HAPPY TO ANY QUESTIONS IT AND WE ALSO HAVE JAKE. WHEN FROM THE DEPARTMENT ON FINANCE WHO'S ALSO YOUR HELP ME AND- QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR DOLLINGER. THIRTY DOLLY. YOUR BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN DOING THEIR PART THAT'S THE REASON THAT WE HAVE. A RESERVE THAT WERE RELYING ON RIGHT NOW AND YOU TALK ABOUT REVENUES REVENUES ARE TAXES TO BUSINESSES. AND I HAPPEN TO BE ONE OF THOSE BUSINESS OWNERS DIE DON'T MAKE A MILLION SO I KNOW I'M GONNA BE UNDERNEATH THAT. BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL THOUSANDS OF BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA THEY DO MAKE OVER MILLION DOLLARS AND THEY'VE BEEN DOING THEIR PART FOR THE LAST. TEN YEARS AND WE'VE HAD THIS ECONOMIC GROWTH THAT WE'VE BEEN PENALIZED AND SO. WHAT'S THE REASON THAT IF YOU WERE A BUSINESS OR YOU WOULD STAY IN CALIFORNIA TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. AND PRODUCE YOUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. SO I'M I'M KIND OF BATTLE THAT IT DID COME IN OF. SAY THAT BUSINESSES NEED TO DO THEIR PART WHEN WE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE DONE THEIR PART AND WE GET WE GOT PROP THIRTY WHICH GOT EXTENDED WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO BE- SHORT TERM AS WELL. AND SO I I'M COULD I THINK THAT'S KIND OF I KNOW THAT WERE SUPPOSEDLY. IN A YOU KNOW. RECESSION HERE BUT IT'S A RECESSION THAT'S BEEN CAUSED- BY KOBE. AND WE KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET SOME OF THAT REFUNDED- WHICH I ASKED LAST TIME ABOUT HOW MUCH DO WE EXPECT TO GET FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- EMERGENCY FUNDING THAT COMES BACK SO- I JUST I GUESS MY QUESTION WOULD BE. AS A BUSINESS OWNER WHAT DOES THE FUTURE LOOK LIKE FOR ME. SERVICE NUMBER. YES I'LL SPEAK I SPECIFICALLY TO THESE PROVISIONS AND SPEAK- I GET A LITTLE BIT MORE BROADLY I THINK A SPECIFIC TO THESE PROVISIONS THAT WE DID- THE ADMINISTRATION DID A DESIGNED AND IN A WAY TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THAT CAN DOWN MAKE IS HAVING AN IMPACT ON ALL CALIFORNIA OR SIGN ALL CALIFORNIANS ON WORKERS AS WELL AS ON BUSINESSES AND RISKING THOSE IMPACTS ALL ROUND AT THE STATE AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS ENGAGED IN THAT TASK FORCE ON THAT JOBS AND BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY I WOULD STAKEHOLDERS FROM SMALL BUSINESSES LARGER BUSINESS THERE IS. WAIT I STAKEHOLDERS WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE EVERYONE IS WORKING ON AND WHEN IT COMES TO THESE SPECIFIC PROVISIONS NUMBER ONE WE DID WANT TO BUILD AND- MAKING SURE THAT IF YOU HAVE BEEN A DISINCENTIVE CREDITS- BUT THEY ARE UNDERSTOOD MILLION DOLLARS YOU ARE TO USE THAT IF YOU HAVE AN OPERATING LOSSES AND YOUR INCOME IS LESS THAN ONE MILLION DOLLARS ARE YOU NOT OPERATING LOSS WHICH BUT- ALSO IF YOU ARE IN THOSE WORRIES. AND WHERE YOU ALL I ONE OF THOSE EXAMS WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS DESIRED BUT THAT'S WHAT RECENT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS THE ECONOMY FIRST ANY IS THAT I THE EIGHTY THE OPERATING DAYS OR BUSINESS INCENTIVES RATES NOW WILL BE OP IN THE BAND TO USE THEM IN THE FUTURE AND WE KNOW THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY SO THAT. LOVE IN TERMS OF THE WHOLE PACKAGE WE DID TRY TO NO WHERE ALL WHO ARE. WEST THIS IS ASKED THEY WILL THANKS. ALL IS THAT AND PUMP IT UP. WATER SURE AND ONE REALLY KNOWS HOW THE NEXT YEARS. OUR GOING TO GO A CERTAIN IN. AND IF YOU ACCEPT THIS BUDGET DID NOT HAVE A COPY TERMS LOW THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED AND KNOW THAT WE RECEIVED OF HEAT AS AN ALL OF THE IN THE WATCHES HAD. ABOUT THE EXTRA OF THOSE. AND THE PAIN THAT MAY CALL BUT THE- CERTAINLY UNDER THAT WERE OPERATING A VERY DE BY. AND WHY OF THE BEST THINGS THAT WE CAN DO IS SURE THAT EVEN AS WE ARE MAKING THESE THAT'S WE ARE MADE SAYING THE ARM THAT WE CAN YOU AND- MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE LANES. FOR A ROBOT WORK. AND SO I THINK WHEN WE LOOK IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR OVERALL PACKAGE GIVEN HOW MUCH TRAFFIC USE ARE FALLING OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS WAS OPERATE MEASURE FOR THOSE THREE YEARS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO MAKE SOME INVESTMENTS ARE WAYS NOT CUT THEM BACK AS MUCH AS WE WOULD THEIR RIGHTS HAVE TO CUT THEM BACK AND THEN AS THE ECONOMY COVERS. THOSE BUSINESSES ARE OTHER TAX PAPERS THAT HAVE THESE NET OPERATING LOSSES HOBBIES BUSINESS INSTEAD OF CREDITS AND EVEN WITH THE GUARDRAILS THAT WE PUT IN PLACE ARE NOT ABLE TO USE THEM RIGHT NOW THEY WILL BE ABLE TO USE THOSE AND- THE DALAI FOLLOW. IT MAY JUST MAKE A CALL THAT AND LAST COUPLE MONTHS WE'VE SEEN BUSINESSES WHO. DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE'S GO HOLES IN THEIR THE BUSINESSES THAT CREATE JOBS WE'VE SEEN WE KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENED IN THE JOB MARKET BECAUSE WE SEE THE UNEMPLOYMENT SKYROCKETING PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY LOST THEIR JOBS. SO TO MOVE FORWARD WITH AN ECONOMY THAT'S GOING TO WORK BUSINESSES HAVE TO HIRE PEOPLE AND THEN PEOPLE CAN HAVE A JOB AND THEY CAN PAY. TAXES BOTH THE BUSINESS AND THE INDIVIDUAL SO I CAUTION YOU TO THINK THAT IF WE HAD A LOT OF THESE BUSINESSES ARE ON THE COST OF IT OR ARE THEY GOING TO STAY IN BUSINESS OR NOT. SO IF YOU. DON'T ALLOW THEM TO DIFFER. EVEN IF THEY'RE OVER A MILLION DOLLARS- THEY MAY NOT BE IN BUSINESS AND THEN THERE IS FOR SURE A RECESSION BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO HIRE PEOPLE SO I JUST. WANT TO MAKE THAT POINT AND DRIVING HOME THE- BUSINESSES HIRE PEOPLE. YOU CANNOT HAVE A JOB UNTIL SOMEBODY HIGHER YOU. AND YOU CAN'T PAY TAXES TELL SOMEBODY PAYS YOU FIRST. SO IT'S- IT'S NOT PRODUCTIVE TO PENALIZE A BUSINESS HE WAS ALREADY BEEN PENALIZED UNFORTUNATELY BY KOBE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OF MEMBERS. THIRTY MORE LIVE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THE STAFF REPORT FOR THIS BILL SPENDS A LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT USED CAR DEALERS AND GETTING THEIR SALES TAX- INTO THE- CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION WITHIN THIRTY DAYS AND- IT JUST SEEMS. RICH TO ME- THREE MONTHS AGO WE WERE BRAGGING ABOUT BEING TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS- IN IN BUDGET SURPLUS AND NOW WE'RE DOING THAT FLOW GAME WERE ASKING. WHEN INDUSTRY TO PAY THE SALES TAX A WHOLE LOT SOONER AND IT JUST SEEMS LIKE WHAT HOW QUICKLY THE MONEY OF FALLEN BUT- WHY DON'T WE JUST REQUIRE THAT USED CAR. DEALERSHIPS FILE THEIR SALES TAX RETURNS EVERY MONTH. INSTEAD OF QUARTERLY OR SEMI ANNUALLY OR ANNUALLY- WE SPENT A WHOLE LOT OF SPACE. ON THIS AND I'M I'M JUST CURIOUS. IF THE IF THERE'S NOTHING TO BE GAINED INTEREST RATES ARE JUST ABOUT ZERO SO I'M JUST. I'M JUST SORT OF CURIOUS WHY. AND I THINK WE'RE JUST TALKING I MEAN TRYING TO. HAVE A TIME VALUE MONEY JUST THE MINIMUM SO I'M I'M JUST ONE MORE WE SPEND SO MUCH TIME PLAYING THE FULL GAME WITH THIS INDUSTRY. THE SERVICE WILL OFTEN YOU CARE TO RESPOND YES- SENATOR MORE A LOT ON THIS ISSUE I'LL SPEAK BRIEFLY AND THEN I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE TO CHAMBERLAIN WHO MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS THE WAY THAT WE ARE THINKING ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL THIS IS NOT. REALLY A TIME VALUE MONEY PROPOSAL OR AS NECESSARILY AN ACCELERATION PROPOSAL ALSO MATS SENSE IT'S DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE THAT WE WERE I WAS AND DOLLY HAD ASKED ABOUT WHERE IT IS ABOUT WHEN CERTAIN PAYMENTS ARE PAID OR WHEN THEY CAN BE USED THIS CASE IS DIFFERENT THIS IS ABOUT USED CAR DEALERS THAT ARE AT. MAYBE NOT REMAINING SALES TAX AND ALL OR CERTAINLY NOT IN THE AMOUNT THAT THEY ARE LEGALLY OBLIGATED TO REMAIN BASED ON THE ACTUAL VALUE OF THE SALE SO THIS IS REALLY AN ENFORCEMENT ISSUE MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE IS ON A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD MORE THAN A TIME VALUE OF MONEY ISSUE BUT LET ME TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE TO CHAMBERLAIN'S WHO CAN TALK ABOUT ADDITIONAL. SKILLED THANK YOU. SO I AS HIS VINCE. SAID ON THIS REALLY IS NOT ABOUT. OR REVENUE. IT'S ABOUT TRYING TO CLOSE THE TACK GAP. THAT EXISTS RIGHT NOW. NOT FOR THE MID OF USE CAR DEALERS NECESSARILY BUT FOR A CERTAIN SEGMENT OF USED CAR DEALERS WHO ARE NOT- REMITTING THE SALES TAX AND THE CLOCK ON CARS- AND SO THIS IS JUST A MECHANISM. TO MAKE THAT. TO MAKE THE LEAKAGE MORE CLOSELY SO THAT SO THAT THEY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO REMIT YEAH. NOT BE ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH NOT. READING THE CELLS. THAT WE'RE GOING AFTER BAD PLAYERS. NUMBER BY THE WERE ALSO SPENDING TWENTY. MILLION THE LAUGHTER GOOD PLAYERS WITH GOING AFTER INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS THAT HAVE BEEN. SO I'M JUST TRYING TO.
