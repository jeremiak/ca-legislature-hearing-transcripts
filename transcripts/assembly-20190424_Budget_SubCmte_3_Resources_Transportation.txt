FOURTEEN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN APPEARS TO BE NONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION WE WILL VOTE ON THIS -- SOMETIME AFTER WE ESTABLISH A QUORUM. AIR BE IS HERE I UNDERSTAND SO -- WILL. JUMP BACK IN THE AGENDA TO ISSUE NUMBER. ONE GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN PLAN. MY NOTES SAY AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. YEAH WELL SAKE IF. THERE'S HIGHER COMMITTEE MY NAME IS THERE OUT THERE LISTENING SO THEY'RE OUT THERE I'M SURE MY NAME IS ET CHIANG OF A DEPUTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. AND I'M HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT OUR REQUEST FOR INCREASED AUTHORITY FOR LITIGATION COSTS. SO THIS INCREASED AUTHORITY WOULD ENSURE THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO BOTH PURSUE ADDITIONAL CIVIL CASES RELATED TO VIOLATIONS OF OUR EMISSIONS STANDARDS. AND ALSO TO DEFEND CALIFORNIA'S VEHICLE STANDARDS AGAINST ATTACKS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO CURRENTLY WE HAVE A DIRECT DRAW ACCOUNT WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE OF THREE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. THEY CHARGE US BASED ON THE HOURS THAT WE USE SO WE DON'T USE ALL THE FUNDS EVERY YEAR WE DON'T EXPEND ALL OF THAT IT ALL DEPENDS ON HOW COMPLEX OUR CASES ARE. WITH A LOT OF INVOLVED A LOT OF EXPERT WITNESSES TRAVEL WHETHER THEY GO TO TRIAL. AND WE'RE ASKING TO UP OR AUTHORITY AND MILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE WE HAVE BUMPED UP AGAINST THAT THREE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'VE HAD THESE COMPLICATED TRIALS GRANT IS BEATING AND INCREASED COSTS FOR TWO REASONS. FIRST OF ALL. WE ARE PURSUING ADDITIONAL EMISSION STANDARDS CASES WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THE V. VOLKSWAGEN CASE WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THE FIAT CHRYSLER CASE. IN THOSE CASES THE AG'S OFFICE ACTUALLY DIDN'T CHARGE US FOR THE LITIGATION COSTS BECAUSE THERE IS A CONSUMER COMPONENT. AND THE CONSUMER LAW SECTION WAS INVOLVED AND SO THE AG'S OFFICE ABSORB THOSE COSTS AND THEN RECEIVED REIMBURSEMENT AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENTS. WE ARE WORKING TO INVESTIGATE ADDITIONAL EMISSION CASES RIGHT NOW. THE CONSUMER LAW SECTION AT THE AGES IS NOT INVOLVED SO THEY HAVE STARTED TO CHARGES FOR THOSE CASES. THE SECOND REASON IS AS THIS COMMITTEE KNOWS WE ARE CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN A FIGHT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OVER. THE RIGHT OF CALIFORNIA TO SET OUR OWN ADMISSION STANDARDS THEY'RE TRYING TO ROLL BACK OUR STANDARDS WHICH IS GOING TO MAKE IT HARDER. IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO MEET OUR CLEAN AIR AND CLIMATE GOALS. SO WE'VE ALREADY FILED A FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT REQUEST TO TRY TO FIND OUT WHAT LEGAL BASIS THEY HAVE ROLLING BACK THE STANDARDS. AND IF AS WE EXPECTS THEY FINALIZE A RULE TO WITHDRAW OUR WAIVER AND THREATEN OUR AUTHORITY. YOU CAN THAT WE'RE GONNA SUE SO WHERE CAN TO BE DEFENDING OUR VEHICLE STANDARDS AND WE EX ANTICIPATE THAT THAT'S GONNA BE A LONG EXTENDED LITIGATION THAT'S GONNA BE QUITE EXPENSIVE -- AS I MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING OF OUR REMARKS IF WE ARE LUCKY IN OUR LITIGATION COSTS ARE LOW WE WILL NOT USE THESE FUNDS BUT WE DO WANT TO HAVE THE AUTHORITY SO THAT WE CAN DEFEND OUR STANDARDS IF WE NEED. TO GREAT THANK YOU -- JUST DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OR LA -- HAVE COMMENTS SEEING NONE -- WILL ASK IF THERE'S PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE ONE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. NO ONE APPEARS TO BE GETTING UP SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION WILL VOTE ON THIS -- AFTER WE ESTABLISH A QUORUM. ISSUE TWO IS -- OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND HAZARD ASSESSMENT [inaudible] WE HAVE. GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN BLOOM LINE LAWRENCE ICE I'M DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH HAZARD ASSESSMENT AND WITH ME IS CARL THE NECK RISKS ARE. ACTING CHIEF COUNSEL OKAY. SO WE'RE OF THE WE'RE REQUESTING OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE GENERAL FUND. ON GOING TO PAY FOR DEFENSE OF CIVIL LAWSUITS BROUGHT AGAINST A WE HAVE PRIMARILY FOR ITS ACTIONS AS THE LEAD AGENCY FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE SAFE DRINKING WATER AND TOXIC ENFORCEMENT. ACT WERE OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX OR PROPOSITION. SIXTY FIVE AWAY AS A SMALL AGENCY AND DOESN'T HAVE A PERMANENT. LITIGATION BUDGET COSTS FOR DEFENSE. OF LITIGATION AGAINST OTO WERE HISTORICALLY COVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE'S SMALL BUDGET ALLOCATION. FOR SMALL OFFICES -- THE BUDGET AMOUNT FOR SMALL OFFICES IS ABOUT A THOUSAND HOURS PER YEAR -- AND WE HAS RECENTLY OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS. EXPERIENCED A NEED FOR GREATER LITIGATION SUPPORT -- AND ANTICIPATES THE TREND CONTINUING. THANK YOU -- LA -- OR DEPARTMENT FINANCE. IS THERE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE NUMBER. TWO SEEING NONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION AND WE WILL TAKE THIS UP AFTER ESTABLISHING. A QUORUM I DO WANT TO MAKE IT OUT SMITH NOW -- WITH RESPECT TO ISSUES ELEVEN TWELVE AND THIRTEEN UNDER -- DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION. OF WE ARE GOING -- TO MOVE THAT HEARING TO MAY FIRST SADLY -- THE EXECUTIVE TEAM IS ATTENDING A FUNERAL -- OF RETIRED REGIONAL CHIEF STAND CRAIG WHO PASSED AWAY RECENTLY AND SO WE'VE ACCOMMODATED -- TO OF THE DEPARTMENT SO THAT -- THEIR EXECUTIVE TEAM COULD -- TO ATTEND THAT FUNERAL. WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ISSUE THREE AS SAID THE TNC HERE. YOU HAVE JUST THE ONE ISSUE -- FOR YOUR DEPARTMENT WELCOME TO SEE IF I COULD MORNING GERMAN BLOOM. ARE THE KIDS HE IS REQUESTING A SEVEN FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND GENERAL FUND MONIES. THREE DESIGN -- ONE SECTION OF THE CITY OF JACKSON STORM WATER -- SYSTEM. THERE'S A THAT'S BEEN RETROFIT -- FIGHTING BACK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DID ANALYSIS ON THE STANDARDS PORTRAYED ABOVE THE CITY OF DOWNTOWN JACKSON. FOUNDED WAS UNSTABLE. AND THAT A COMPLETE DAM FAILURE COULD RESULT IN UP TO FIFTEEN FEET OF TAILINGS IN A DATING DOWNTOWN JACKSON. SO THE PSC -- SPRANG INTO ACTION REQUESTED MONEY TO RETROFIT THE DAM. THAT MUCH OF IT IS NOW BEEN COMPLETED. HOWEVER THE STORMWATER SYSTEM FOR THAT FEEDS DIRECTLY TO THE CITY OF JACKSON STORM WATER SYSTEM. THE DAMS SO MUCH SYSTEM CAN HANDLE ABOUT THREE TIMES MORE WATER. THAN THE CITY SYSTEM. SO WE'RE REQUESTING FUNDS TO REDESIGN JUST THAT ONE SECTION. OF THE CITY OF JACKSON STORMWATER SYSTEM. AND ONCE WE COMPLETE THAT REDESIGN WILL THAT REQUEST FUNDS TO CONSTRUCT. THANK YOU -- JUST FOR THE EDIFICATION THE PUBLIC I THINK I KNOW THE I KNOW THAT I KNOW THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION BUT THE CONCERN IS THAT IF THERE'S A DAM FAILURE. OF THE CITY OF JACKSON WILL BE INUNDATED BY -- THE OUTFLOW FROM THE DAM WHICH INCLUDES TAILINGS THAT HAVE BEEN. KEPT BEHIND THE THE DAM -- WIRE TAILINGS A BAD THING YEAH. YEAH. SO THE THE TAILINGS ARE BEHIND THE DAM -- THEY CONTAIN ELEVATED LEVELS OF HI METALS THAT HEAVY METALS PARDON ME MERCURY. LEAD ARSENIC SO FAIRLY NOXIOUS STUFF. DTS SEE HAS REDESIGNED - A RETROFIT FOR THE DAM TO ACTUALLY INSURE THAT IT MEETS ALL CURRENT STABILITY AND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS. PART OF THAT -- REDESIGNED ENSURE THAT -- STORM WATER WOULD BE DIVERTED AROUND THE SO THAT IT WOULDN'T BUILD UP BEHIND THE RETROFITTED DAM. WHEN THEY DID THAT? THEY ACTUALLY HAD TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF WATER COMING OUT FROM THE DAMS STORM WATER SYSTEM. SO THEY THEY BASICALLY CONSTRUCTED HUGE PIPES LEADING INTO DIRECTLY INTO THE CITY STORMWATER SYSTEM. THE THREAT NOW IS THAT IN A IN A BIG STORM. THAT. THE DAM STORMWATER SYSTEM CAN IN AND DAY. THE CITY STORMWATER SYSTEM CAUSING FLOODING POTENTIAL STATE LIABILITY. SO THIS REDESIGN IS TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM. UNDERSTOOD ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION MORNING -- IS THERE ANY -- REPORTER OR COMMENT FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MORE LA -- VERY SHAKEN HAD NOW -- IS THERE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE NUMBER THREE UNDER DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL. SEEING NONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION AND AS SOON AS WE ESTABLISH QUORUM WILL START TAKING SOME VOTES. WE HAVE TWO ISSUES FOR DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION ISSUES FOUR AND FIVE NICE TO SEE A GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. MY NAME IS LIZ MAKER CAM THE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION. ISSUE NUMBER FOUR BEFORE YOU TODAY IS THE DEPARTMENT'S REQUEST FOR TO YOUR FUNDING FROM THE STATE PARKS PROTECTION FUND AND FOR POSITIONS FOR THE CONTINUATION OF TO COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND PARK ACCESS PROJECTS. A COMMUNITY OUTREACH PILOT PROGRAM IS AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO ENGAGING UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES FROM TWO OF THE STATE'S LARGEST URBAN POPULATION CENTERS. THE BAY AREA AT CANDLESTICK STATE PARK AND LOS ANGELES STATE HISTORIC PARK. THIS PROJECT HAS ESTABLISHED COMMUNITY LIAISON TO WORK WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND NONPROFIT GROUPS TO CONDUCT OUTREACH AND ENGAGE WITH LOCAL COMMUNITY MEMBERS. TO CREATE CULTURALLY RELEVANT PARK PROGRAMMING THAT INCORPORATES THE ASSETS IN THE EXPERIENCES OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES AROUND THE PARK. OUR HISTORY AND RELEVANCY A PILOT PROJECT IS AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO IMPROVING PUBLIC INTERPRETATION THROUGH A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. THE CURRENT PROGRAM IS THAT TO STATE HISTORIC PARKS AND PRESIDIO D. SANTA BARBARA AND CAL CITRUS PARK. IT ADDRESSES AN INCREASING RECOGNITION OF THE NEED FOR IMPROVED INTERPRETATION PROGRAMMING THAT REPRESENTS THE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. THE GOAL IS TO CREATE CULTURALLY RELEVANT AND INCLUSIVE PROGRAMMING AND IN DOING SO PROVIDE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CIVIC DIALOGUE AND ENGAGEMENT WITHIN THE STATE PARK SYSTEM. SO THESE TWO PILOT PROJECTS ARE KEY INITIATIVES IN THE DEPARTMENT'S EFFORTS TO MAKE PARK SERVICES MORE RELEVANT TO A CONSTITUENCY THAT'S REFLECTIVE OF CALIFORNIANS DIVERSITY. AND I CAN TAKE QUESTIONS ON OUR MOVE TO THE NEXT. ONE SEEING NO QUESTIONS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LA -- HAVE NO COMMENTS IS THERE PUBLIC COMMENT ON EITHER OF THESE ITEMS ISSUE FOR ISSUE. FIVE UNDER DEPART MENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION. WE HAVE A QUITE GROUP HERE TODAY. THAT MEANS YOUR PRESENTATION WAS EXTREMELY THOROUGH AND ANSWERED ALL QUESTIONS RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH YEAH AND WE WILL GET TO THIS AFTER WE HAVE A QUORUM HEY JOHN -- YOU DID YOU HAVE YOUR NINE DIGIT FIVE NOW CHAIR -- SO ISSUE NUMBER LIVE THE COMMENTS. THE DIFFERENCE REQUESTING THREE MILLION DOLLARS ON THE STATE PARK AND RECREATION FUND TO PAY VENDOR FEES AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS FEES ASSOCIATED WITH PARKING CITATION. DEBT COLLECTION SERVICES THIS IS NOT A NEW ACTIVITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT AND THE PROPOSAL DOESN'T REPRESENT ANY CHANGES TO STATE PARKS PRACTICES ARE POLICIES -- HOWEVER RECENT CHANGE IN OUR VENDORS HAS AFFORDED THE DEPARTMENT AN OPPORTUNITY TO MODERNIZE THE WAY WE COLLECT OUTSTANDING CITATION THAT. SO THIS PROPOSAL WILL RESULT IN A NET INCREASE TO STATE PARK REVENUES WHICH WOULD OFFSET ANY OF THE EXPENDITURES. IT ALSO SEEKS TO MAKE THESE PAYMENTS THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT'S NORMAL SUPPORT APPROPRIATION PROCESS INSTEAD OF THROUGH REIMBURSEMENTS WHICH IS MORE IN LINE WITH STATE ACCOUNTING AND BUDGETING PRACTICES. AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THERE ARE NONE AND WE HAVE NO REPORTS SAID -- AND IT -- IS THERE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ONCE AGAIN ON EITHER OF THESE ITEMS SEEING NONE. NOW I THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND TO VERY MUCH APPRECIATED WILL MOVE ON TO THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION ISSUES SIX AND SEVEN GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING.

BOTH ONSHORE AND OFFSHORE AT PLATFORM HOLLY IN RINCON ISLAND AFTER THE RESPECTIVE LESSEES FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY AND DEFAULTED ON THEIR LEASE AND STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS.

OF LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE A OF LA -- REPORT JUST A SIMILAR COMMENT AS THE COASTAL COMMISSION THERE WAS AN ADDITIONAL THREE MILLION DOLLARS PROVIDED IN THE CURRENT YEAR PROCESS THROUGH THE GEL BC SO THIS IS NOT THE WHOLE STORY. THANK YOU -- THAT PART OF FINANCE NO COMMENTS THE GOOD MORNING MS RESTS WELCOME. IS THERE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON EITHER OF THESE ITEMS. SEEING NONE SOUTH EL WOOD IS REFERENCE TO THE TOWN. THAT -- IS ADJACENT REFERENCE TO THAT -- OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS RESERVOIR. THE SOUTH EL WOULD FIELD WHICH IS OFF SHORE AT THE CITY OF THE LEAD AND SANTA BARBARA COUNTY IT'S REALLY JUST AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO SAY WHY WOULD WE NAME -- ANYTHING LIKE THAT AFTER ONE OF THE BLUES BROTHERS. AND NICE. NICE ADDITION. THAT HAVING BEEN SAID THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTE SHERRY MUCH -- WE ARE NOW ON MY LOSING MY PLACE HERE. DEPARTMENT AFICIONADO. DIRECTOR BOTTOM IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU I WANT TO ASK YOU TO PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE WITH AN UPDATE ON THE DEPARTMENTS IMPLEMENTATION OF SERVICE BASED BUDGETING. BEFORE PRESENTING YOUR OTHER ITEMS. THANK YOU FOR THAT OPPORTUNITY CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS STAFF. SO. I'D LIKE. TO COVER THE WHO THE WHAT THE WHERE IN THE WHY. SO WHAT IS SERVICE BASED BUDGETING. IT TURNS OUT IS AN ACTUAL BUSINESS DISCIPLINE. SO THE CAST OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE HOLDERS OF MASTERS OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION DEGREES CONSULTING FIRMS. REALLY FOCUS ON THIS NICHE OF APPLYING AN ANALYTICAL TOOL. TO INSTITUTIONS TO IMPROVE THEIR PERFORMANCE. AND WITHIN THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY AN EVEN NARROWER KNEES WHICH IS BRINGING THIS MORE MODERN THINKING ABOUT BUSINESS ENTERPRISES THE PUBLIC ENTITIES. SO WHEN YOU DO SERVICE BASED BUDGETING. YOU FOCUS ON FOR PRIMARY ASPECTS. IN USING YOUR ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK. ON TO THE INTO T. YOU'RE REVIEWING AND SEEKING TO IMPROVE HERE THE FOUR ASPECTS. THE FIRST IS IT'S HEAVILY TASK SPACE. YOU CREATE AN ANALYTICAL STRUCTURE. O GO DIRECTLY INTO THE LIST OF SERVICE SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES. THE ENTITY PROVIDES ACTUAL GRANULAR TASKS. THE SECOND ASPECT IS IT'S VERY LABOR FOCUSED. AS YOU'RE IDENTIFYING YOUR SWEET OF TASKS YOU'RE ALSO ASKING AND ANSWERING YOURSELF HOW MANY LABOR HOURS PER TASK. AND YOUR CURRENT LABOR EXPENDITURE PER THOSE TAX. IN YOUR PROJECTED FUTURE NEEDS RELATIVE TO THOSE TASKS SO YOU'RE LOOKING YEAR LABOR HOURS. THE THIRD ASPECT IS IT FORCES THE ENTITY TO ORGANIZED BY SERVICE. YOU'VE GONE THROUGH TASK YOU'VE GONE THROUGH LABOR HOURS AND THEN YOU'RE PROMPTED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT ARE YOUR CLIENTS EXPECT TO FROM YOU WHAT ARE YOUR CUSTOMERS. SEEING IS THE NEEDED SERVICES IN YOUR ORGANIZING THEN YOUR TASKS AND LABOR HOURS. AROUND A SERVICE CONSTRUCT AND LASTLY YOU WILL MERGE WITH THE TOOL THAT ACTUAL. VISUAL AND WANTED OF TOOL THAT ALLOWS YOU IN USUALLY TO LOOK AT YOUR TASKS THEIR ADJUSTMENT OVER TIME YOUR LABOR HOURS THE CONNECTION TO TASKS. IN YOUR ORIENTATION TOWARD SERVICES SO THAT'S THE WHAT. IS SERVICE BASED BUDGETING HOW DID WE GET HERE TODAY. WELL IT'S A SEVENTY YEAR OLD PLUS STORY. IT TURNS OUT A COUPLE YEARS AGO I WAS LOOKING IN OUR FILES AND I FOUND A NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT REPORT FROM BOOZ ALLEN THE NATIONAL CONSULTING FIRM. COMMISSIONED BY THE CALIFORNIA. JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE. AND THAT REPORT CONCLUDES ONE OF THE DEPARTMENTS MAIN HURDLES BACK IN NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT WAS FINDING SUSTAINABLE FUND. YOU THE LEGISLATURE HAVE AMENDED OUR CODE AT LEAST ONCE SECTION SEVEN TEN POINT. FIVE AND THE CLEAR THE FOLLOWING QUOTE THE DEPARTMENT CONTINUES TO BE AN ADEQUATELY FUNDED. AND MUST SECURE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE AND RELIABLE FUNDING. BUT THE STORY OF HOW WE GOT HERE GOES ON BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TEN AND ELEVEN ASSEMBLY BILL. TWENTY THREE SEVENTY SIX INSTRUCTED OUR DEPARTMENT TO CREATE A STAKEHOLDER BASED PROCESS. AND LOOK AT REFORM. ITEMS FOR OUR DEPARTMENT AND OUR SISTER COMMISSION. THAT PROCESS PRODUCED A STAKEHOLDER NONPARTISAN REPORT TWENTY EIGHT RECOMMENDATIONS. FOR REFORM OF OUR DEPARTMENT AND OUR COMMISSION. THEN WE HAD TO BUDGET CYCLES AT LEAST. IN A SUBSEQUENT SENATE BILL THAT IS REQUIRED OUR DEPARTMENT TO TRUE UP OUR FEES. WITH OUR COST OF SERVICE. AND WE'VE ENGAGED IN DIFFICULT DISCUSSIONS AROUND AT LEAST EIGHT SETS OF FEE INCREASES. THE BUDGET ACT OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN INSTRUCTED OUR DEPARTMENT TO REPORT BACK ON THAT EARLIER SUITE OF TWENTY EIGHT RECOMMENDATIONS. AND RECONVENE THE BAND OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS. WE GOT THE GROUP BACK TOGETHER. AND WE ISSUE TO YOU A REPORT IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN IDENTIFYING OUR PROGRESS IN ALL THOSE TWENTY RECOMMENDATIONS. WE KEPT THE BAND TOGETHER IN NOVEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN DAY PROVIDED TO YOU. A BROAD STAKEHOLDER EXPENDITURE CONCEPT FOR OUR DEPARTMENT THAT HAD FOUR PRONGS. WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE TO EXPAND CONSERVATION EFFORTS IMPROVE HUNTING AND FISHING OPPORTUNITIES? INCREASE THE STABILITY AND SERVICES WE PROVIDE FOR THE REGULATED COMMUNITIES. GET MORE CALIFORNIANS OUTDOORS AND DO IT IN A CULTURALLY RELEVANT TWENTY FIRST CENTURY WAY. THAT EXPENDITURE CONCEPT I BELIEVE INFLUENCE THE BUDGET ACT OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN OUR DEPARTMENT RECEIVED A BUDGET% AUGMENTATION OF THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. A SPECIFIC INSTRUCTION TO COMPLETE SERVICE BASED BUDGETING AND TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO DO THE SERVICE BASED BUDGETING SO THAT'S WHAT IT IS THAT'S HOW WE GOT HERE. WHY ARE WE IN THE SPOT? I BELIEVE WE'RE IN THE SPOT BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT IS ONE OF THE OLDEST AGENCIES AND STATE GOVERNMENT. NEXT YEAR ARE COMMISSION CELEBRATES ITS ONE HUNDRED FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY. THERE ARE MORE ANIMALS AND PLANTS IN THIS STATE THAN ANY OTHER STATE IN THE UNION. WE HAVE THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF TYPES OF SPECIES. AND OF THOSE MORE ARE FOUND NO WHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD IN HERE. SO THE RARENESS OF THEM IS ALSO INCREDIBLY HOT. WE'RE ONE OF TWENTY FIVE BIOLOGICAL HOT SPOTS ON THE ENTIRE PLANET FOR BIODIVERSITY. AND WE INTERFACE WITH SO MUCH OF THE BUSINESS AND REGULATED COMMUNITY I BELIEVE WE PROVE THIS THEORY OF HAVING A THRIVING ECONOMY. AND A HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT SIMULTANEOUSLY. AND WE STRUGGLED. TO BUILD OUR TRUST OUR TRANSPARENCY IN CANDOR. AND I BELIEVE THE SERVICE BASED BUDGETING TOOL IS OUR PATHWAY THROUGH THOSE VALUES. IN A BETTER POSITION WITH YOU IN THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH AND OUR STAKE. SO WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE. SENATE BILL EIGHT FIVE FOUR GAVE US SOME SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS. THIS IS THE BUDGET ACT OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IT'S SAID BY DECEMBER FIFTEENTH OF LAST YEAR. WE NEED TO GET UNDER CONTRACT A CONSULTANT TO COULD DO THIS. WE GOT THAT DONE IN NOVEMBER SO REMOTE THAT A SCHEDULE WE HARD TO LLOYD. TO INTERNATIONAL FORM KNOWN FOR THIS DISCIPLINE. AND IT ACTUALLY TOOK OUR STATE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION TO A SIMILAR ENDEAVOR SO IT'S GOT RELEVANT EXPERIENCE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. YOUR SENATE BILL ALSO TOLD US TO FORM AN EXECUTIVE TEAM BY DECEMBER FIFTEENTH OF LAST YEAR CHECK. DONE. IT TOLD US TO FORM AN EXTERNAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE BY DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR CHECK DONE. IN A TOLD US TO SUBMIT A PRELIMINARY REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT PROGRESS WE'VE DONE THAT. HERE THE NEXT MILESTONES. BY APRIL FIFTEENTH OF TWENTY TWENTY WE NEED TO HAVE COMPLETED THE ENDEAVOR AND PROVIDE YOU A FULL REPORT -- WITH BEGINNING OUR OVERSIGHT. IN THESE HEARINGS ABOUT THAT ENDEAVOR. EXCUSE ME BY JANUARY FIFTEENTH OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS THE FINAL. FULL REPORTS A MISSION AND BY APRIL FIFTEENTH OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE ARE TO SHOW YOU AN OVERSIGHT HEARINGS HOW WE'VE TAKEN THE FINDINGS OF THE REPORT. AND BUILT THEM INTO OUR BUDGET CHANGE PROCESS. WE TOOK THE TWO MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE BUDGET ACT AND DID THIS WITH IT. WE HARD TO AVOID. THAT COST IS ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR A CONTRACT. WE USE THE REMAINING FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND TO COVER A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF INTERNAL COSTS. SO THAT WE CAN KEEP PACE WITH THE LAWYER. I'VE READ DIRECTED AND AFFECT IT ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN OF OUR BEST AND BRIGHTEST FOLKS. TO BE EXPECTATIONS ON THIS ENDEAVOR I'M VERY SERIOUS ABOUT THIS BEING THE DEPARTMENTS ONE OPPORTUNITY. TO COMPLETE OUR EFFORT ON BUILDING TRUST TRANSPARENCY IN CANDOR. OUR HUNDRED FIFTEEN FOLKS HAVE GONE THROUGH A RIGOROUS ANALYTICAL EFFORT AND HAVE IDENTIFIED THREE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE TASKS WE PROVIDE TO THE PUBLIC. NOW AS WE GO THROUGH THE INEVITABLE ARE YOU A LUMBER OR SPLITTER. I THINK THAT MAY BOIL DOWN TO ABOUT TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TASKS. BUT NONE THE LESS WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A DATA RICH. KIND OF REVIEW AND ASSESSMENT OF WHAT WE ACTUALLY DO. WITH HOSTED MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS WE'VE ENGAGED OUR EXTERNAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE OF WHICH WE'VE PUT ABOUT EIGHTY PEOPLE ON WE'VE LAID ALL THIS OUT WE'RE SEEKING INPUT WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE REMAINDER OF THIS PHASE. I BELIEVE AS WE GO TO ABOUT THE FALL OF THIS YEAR. WILL COMPLETE ALL THE MAIN ASSIGNMENTS GET THE DATA DONE GET THE REVIEW DONE START THE ELECTRONIC DASHBOARD GO THROUGH ALL THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE WORK. WHY ISSUE A AND THE REQUEST FOR AN ADDITIONAL TWO MILLION? LET ME PAUSE THERE I CAN EXPLAIN THE SPRING FINANCE LETTER AS ISSUE. EIGHT OR FIELD ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ON JUST THE SERVICE BASED BUDGETING BEFORE WE GO INTO THAT -- JUST QUICK QUESTION I VIEW OF YOU CAN INDULGE OUR SHARES SO SHOULD SOME LIGHT INTO THE WHAT THE INITIAL FINDINGS ARE. A WHAT WHAT DELAYED HAS HAS -- INDICATED OR FOUND AMONGST YOUR THIS REVIEW YES. THIS IS MY TRANSLATION OF WHAT I'M SEEING AS DIRECTOR I'M MAKING SURE I PERSONALLY INVOLVED ON A WEEKLY BASIS I SEE. THREE MAIN TAKEAWAYS FOR ME SO FAR FIRST. I THINK THE DELOITTE PROCESS HAS. FORCED US TO STOP THINKING ABOUT HOW WE IDENTIFY OURSELVES. WITHIN THE BUREAUCRACY OF OUR DEPARTMENT. BUT RATHER ASK OUR CUSTOMERS AND CLIENTS. HOW THEY THINK WE SHOULD IDENTIFY OURSELVES SO IT'S HELPED US SHIFT OUR FOCUS FROM INTERNAL? TO EXTERNAL. BECAUSE ONE OF THE TASKS IS DEFINING YOUR SERVICES. CONNECTED TO YOUR LABOR HOURS. NOT AS WE SEE IT. BUT AS OUR CUSTOMERS SO I THINK THAT'S BEEN INCREDIBLY VALUABLE SECOND. I THINK IT'S ALLOWED US TO LOOK THROUGH THREE THOUSAND PLUS ITEMS. AND IS THE BEGINNING OF THE DISCUSSION ARE SOME OF THOSE NECESSARY ARE THEY RELEVANT. ARE THEY REDUNDANT ARE THERE EFFICIENCIES TO BE HAD WITHIN THAT SORTING OF TASKS. AND THEN LASTLY I'D SAY. AND THIS SURPRISE ME FRANKLY ASSEMBLYMEMBER FONG. I THOUGHT I WOULD FACE MORE INTERNAL RESISTANCE AND ACTUALLY IN THAT CAST OF ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOLKS I'M FINDING IT IS YES. AN ABILITY TO USE A TOOL. AND ACTUALLY COME OUT WITH A PRODUCT THAT WILL HELP OUR STAFF IN THEIR DAILY LIVES. BECAUSE THE TOOL WOULD BE USABLE REGULARLY UPDATED ANNUALLY IS ACTUALLY A DIGITAL PASSPORT THAT ALLOWS YOU TO LOOK AT ALL THIS QUANTIFICATION. SO OWES THE THREE MAIN THINGS I SEE SO FAR. SO HE I'M SORRY. NOW THAT CLEARS ISSUE A ISSUE EIGHT IS OUR REQUESTS THROUGH SPRING FINANCE LETTER FOR A ONE TIME AUGMENTATION OF TWO MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL LICENSE PLATE FUND [inaudible] TO ALLOW US TO COMPLETE WHAT WE CALL PHASE. TWO I TELL YOU TODAY THAT WE WILL GO THROUGH THIS FALL. AND COMPLETE ALL OF THE LARGE BODY OF WORK. BUT A MORE IN POURTANT TASK MAY EMERGING FACE. TO AFTER WE'RE DONE WITH THAT I THINK. THE LONG RUN SUCCESS IS DEPENDED ON ME EDUCATING THREE THOUSAND EMPLOYEES. WHY THIS IS THE RIGHT TOOL? TO USE FOR OUR FUTURE. EDUCATING THE PUBLIC HOW TO CONSISTENTLY USE IT. AND TRAINING ALL THESE CONSTITUENTS AND OUR OWN BODY OF EMPLOYEES. WE LEARN FROM THE PARKS EXPERIENCE WITH A FEW DEEP BRIEFINGS WITH THEM. AND THEY HAD A SIGNIFICANT BODY OF WORK WHICH WAS ABOUT. MAKING THE TOOL A WAY OF LIFE. AND THIS TWO MILLION DOLLARS WE SEEK TO THE SPRING FINANCE LETTER ALLOWS US TO COMPLEX THAT SUBSEQUENT PHASE. TWO MR FUNG HAS QUESTION JUST -- TO TO TO DELVE INTO THAT. WHAT GOES INTO THIS -- INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TOOL AGAIN CAN YOU SHED SOME LIGHT ON THAT YES AND LET ME JUST FIRST SAY. I AM. I HAVE A COMMON PERSON UNDERSTANDING OF SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGY BUT I'M NOT THE TECHNOLOGY EXPERT. UNDER OUR CURRENT PHASE ONE CONTRACT IN FUNDING WE WILL ACTUALLY DEVELOP AN ANALYTICAL TOOL IT'S KIND OF A IT'S GOT ALGORITHMS AS GOT A DATABASE AND ITS SEARCHABLE -- THROUGH DIFFERENT INPUTS. AND THEN IT WILL. DISPLAY IN A PUBLIC OUT FACING WAY. PIE CHARTS AND BAR GRAPHS IT'LL ALLOW YOU US OUR CONSTITUENTS. TO ZOOM IN AT REGION OR LAND FACILITY LEVEL UNDERSTAND THE TASKS RELATED TO WHATEVER YOU'RE SEARCHING. THE PROJECTED NEED YOU KNOW THE UP THE IDEAL VERSION OF THE MISSION VERSES THE CURRENT. THAT'S THE TOOL WE EXPECT TO EMERGE IN THE FALL WITH. WE MADE A STRATEGIC DECISION. DO WE HAVE THE CAPACITY INTERNALLY TO DEVELOP THE WE DID A LOT OF CONVERSATION WITH THE PARKS DEPARTMENT DETERMINED WHETHER WE COULD USE THEIR FORMAT. AND ADAPTED TO US RATHER THAN GOING OUT FOR HIGHER WE MADE THAT CHOICE. IT'S PROVING OUT TO BE A SOLID CHOICE. BUT FACE. TO THE TWO MILLION DOLLARS WE NOW SEE IS ABOUT REALLY. MAKING SURE THREE THOUSAND EMPLOYEES KNOW HOW TO USE THAT THING. WELCOME THAT THING USE THAT THING IT BECOMES PART OF OUR STANDARD PRACTICE FOR BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS. THE MATERIALS WE MIGHT APPEAR WITH YOU AS WE DISCUSS FUTURE BUDGET. THAT'S A WINNING OF THE HEARTS AND MINDS AND IT ACTUALLY MAY BE HARDER IN THE LONG RUN THAN SOME OF THE DATA ANALYTICS SO THIS IS THE TOOL EXISTS RIGHT CURRENTLY OR IS THAT BEING DEVELOPED. IT'S AN ITERATIVE STAGES IT'S NOT FINAL AND IT'S NOT IN THE PHASE WERE READY TO SHARE. BUT I DO THINK THAT'S A MILESTONE MOMENT WHEN WE CAN SHORT START TO GIVE PEOPLE A CHANCE TO TEST DRIVE IT. BUDGET IN AND IN AND IN TERMS OF THE BUDGET REQUEST DOES THAT COMPLETE THE WHOLE THING OR IS THIS. YEAH BECAUSE I WAS ONE TIME SO THE JUSTICE TO THE TWO MAIN. TWENTY YES EVERYTHING THE THE THE ID TOOL AS WELL AS THE TRAINING AND AND THE SECOND PHASE YES [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANKS RECORD YOU WANT TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE NINE GO OUT WE HAVE IN LA -- COME JUST A QUICK COMMENT WE'VE BEEN REALLY ENCOURAGED BY THE PROGRESS AND COMMUNICATION OF THE DEPARTMENT -- AND THE ENTHUSIASM OF DONE GREAT OUT REACH LEGISLATIVE STAFF AND THE PUBLIC AND EVEN THOUGH THIS WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT WAS INITIATED BY THE DEPARTMENT AS IT WAS A LEGISLATIVE THAT THEY'VE REALLY EMBRACED IT AND I'M. AND ARE ARE KIND OF ALL IN AT THIS POINT SO WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT IT WILL YIELD A POSITIVE TOOL FOR ALL OF US TO USE. GREAT GOOD TO HEAR. ISSUE NINE ISSUE NINE I THINK IS. VERY SIMPLE. WE HAVE A SPRING FINANCE LETTER IN FRONT OF YOU TO RELY ON CERTAIN DEDICATED ACCOUNTS. WITHIN OUR MOST MAJOR KIND OF META META FUND WHICH IS THE FISHING GAME PRESERVATION FUND. BY THE WAY THAT'S BEEN AROUND I BELIEVE SINCE NINETEEN OH NINE SO IT'SONE OF THE OLDEST ACCOUNT SINCE THE STATE. FISCAL SYSTEMS. AND OVERALL WHAT WE SEEK IS. A MOVEMENT OF TWO POINT TWO FOUR EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OF AUTHORITY TO MATCH REVENUE. SO MOVING MONEY AROUND WITHIN THE FUN THIS ALLOWS OUR PROGRAMS WERE REVENUE IS OUTPACING AUTHORITY. TO FIND EQUILIBRIUM AND CONVERSELY WHERE -- REVENUE. IS LESS THAN IT ALREADY BRINGING AUTHORITY DOWN AND IT KEEPS US MATCHED ACROSS ALL THE VARIOUS DEDICATED ACCOUNTS WITHIN THE LARGER FISHING GAME PRESERVATION FUND [inaudible] ALL RIGHT [inaudible] THANK YOU. ISSUE TEN TEN FINALISTS I'M SORRY. YOU CAN YOU CAN GO ON SO ISSUE TEN IS ABOUT. OUR FAVORITE ANIMAL YES. AND IT OUR LAST SUBCOMMITTEE MEETING YOU APPROVED OUR BUDGET PROPOSAL ON THE SIDE OF WHAT'S HAPPENED SINCE THEN. WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD SUCCESS GOOD NEWS WE'VE BEEN FUND RAISING FROM OTHER SOURCES. SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE AN EVEN LARGER ENDEAVOR IN A CONCERTED WAY. AND WE RECENTLY RECEIVED A GRANT FROM THE SACRAMENTO SAN JOAQUIN DELTA CONSERVANCY. AND WHAT WE ARE DOING TODAY IN ISSUE TEN IS A SPRING FINANCIAL AT A REQUEST. THAT WOULD INCREASE OUR REIMBURSEMENT AUTHORITY OVER THREE YEARS BY THE AMOUNT OF THAT GROUND WHICH I BELIEVE IS NINE POINT THREE A FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. THAT SAID I COULD HEAR YOU CONTINUING TO REACH OUT TO OTHER POTENTIAL YES SOURCES FOR FUNDING US FEDERAL STATE PUBLIC PRIVATE.

EFFORT AND I WOULD JUST SECOND AND MS EHLERS COMMENTS ABOUT AND BEING GRATEFUL TO ALL OF THE INCREASING ENTHUSIASM WE HAVE BEEN ENGAGED A STAKEHOLDERS NUMEROUS TIMES AND IT FEELS LIKE A VERY OPEN TRANSPARENT POSITIVE PROCESS AND WE'RE EXCITED -- ABOUTTHE INFLECTION POINT THAT THIS COULD BE FOR THIS AGENCIES SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. STEVE BAKER WITH THEIR NEED ASSISTANCE FOR THE MONTEREY BAY AQUARIUM IN SUPPORT OF THE SERVICE BASED BUDGETING THINGS. THANK YOU. LUCAS FOR X.

MORE MISTER CHAIRMAN ROY GROWTH ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA RIFLE AND PISTOL ASSOCIATION AS A DEBORAH BONHAM IS POINTED OUT NUMEROUS TIMES DEPARTMENT IS EXTREMELY OVER TASK IN UNDER FUNDED.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR FOR HE OR PRESENTATIONS DIRECTOR BOTTOM -- WE'LL GET TO A VOTE HI SHELLEY I LIVE WITH THE SERGEANT AT ARMS -- BRIEF HAND OUT FOR MEMBERS ABOUT THE SERVICE BUT JOHN TRUCK THANK YOU -- AS I ANNOUNCED EARLIER WE ARE MOVING THE DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION ITEMS TO MAY FIRST SO THAT TO THE EXECUTIVE TEAM CAN. ATTEND A FUNERAL TODAY. ARE WE HAVE ALREADY HANDLED ISSUES FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN OR AT LEAST HEARD THE OF A PROPOSALS. AND SO OUR LAST -- DEPARTMENT IS THE STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY WE HAVE ISSUES EIGHTEEN AND NINETEEN GOOD MORNING MORNING -- I'LL START WITH ISSUE. EIGHTEEN A SMALL CHIEF DEPUTY IS STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY -- FOR A SMALL AGENCY THAT BECAUSE THE CONSERVANCY HAS A FAIRLY COMPLEX SUPPORT BUDGET WE HAVE ABOUT. THIRTEEN FUNDING SOURCES AT AND THE COMING BUDGET YEAR. AND AS DESCRIBED IN THE ANALYSIS OUR BUDGET HAS HISTORICALLY RELIED ON THE CONSERVANCY FIND. AND BOND FUNDS FOR MOST OF OUR OUR STATE OPERATIONS THE CONSERVANCY FUND IS A SHRINKING FIND AND THE BOND FUNDS OF COURSE ARE LIMITED AND RESTRICTED. SO THE PROPOSED BUDGET WOULD INCREASE OUR PROP ONE SUPPORT FUNDS TO SUPPORT OUR PROBLEM GRANT PROGRAM WE'RE CURRENTLY MANAGING ABOUT NINETY PROP ONE GRANTS. WE HAVE MADE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ABOUT 60% OF OUR PROP ONE FUNDS AND WE HAVE A CURRENT GRANT ROUND THAT WILL BRING IN PROPOSALS AT THE END OF THIS MONTH. AT THE INCREASE IN THE MINIMUM A LICENSE PLATE FIND IS PART OF A LONG TERM STRATEGY TO OBTAIN STABLE AND RESTRICTED BASELINE FUNDING. FOR THE CONSERVANCY I'M AND THE OVER OVERALL TOTAL SUPPORT BUDGET IS SLIGHTLY LESS IN. THE COMING YEAR THAN IT IS THIS CURRENT YEAR. AND WITH THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. SEEING NONE WHY DON'T YOU MOVE ON TO ISSUE NINETEENTH PLEASE OKAY SO I PROVIDED -- WITH THE SERGEANT A BROCHURE. FOR THE COAST OVERNIGHT PROGRAM THIS IS THE PROGRAM THAT WAS CREATED WITH AB TWO FIFTY THE LOWER COST COASTAL ACCOMMODATIONS PROGRAM. I'M IT THAT PROGRAM DIRECTED THE CONSERVANCY TO COMPLETE AN ASSESSMENT -- THAT ASSESSMENT WAS COMPLETED IN MARCH PROP SIXTY EIGHT INCLUDED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE COASTAL CONSERVANCY TO FIND OUT THE LOWER COST OVERNIGHT ACCOMMODATION PROGRAM. AND THE BUDGET PROPOSAL WOULD BE AN INITIAL -- INITIAL FUNDING TO START FINDING THOSE PROJECTS. WHAT KIND OF RESULTS YOU GET FOR THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS WOULD YOU ANTICIPATE -- DOESN'T SOUND LIKE MUCH MONEY GIVEN YEAH WELL I WILL HAVE THE SEAT THERE'S THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE COASTAL CONSERVANCY THERE'S ANOTHER THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR STATE PARKS TO FIND. LOWERCOST COASTAL ACCOMMODATIONS IN STATE PARKS I THINK IT REALLY DEPENDS ON WHETHER WE'RE BUILDING NEW FACILITIES. OR ADDING ON AND I DON'T I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A SPECIFIC ANSWER OF HOW MANY UNITS WE THINK WE'LL GET FOR THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS -- BUT WE CAN GET BACK TO YOU YOU JUST CHECK WELL ONE PROJECT -- THAT I'M FAMILIAR WITH AND IN IN MY DISTRICT THAT THE BANK -- BRANCH MOTEL I THINK IS -- ON PCH WHICH HAS BEEN SITTING THERE. FOR THE DETERIORATING FOR PROBABLY THIRTY YEARS OR SO. MIKE RIGHT IN THAT YEAH -- THAT THE STATE PARK PROJECT BUT I THAT SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT AND I KNOW THAT THAT ONE ALONE WILL BE FAIRLY EXPENSIVE AT THE HISTORIC. PROPERTY SO THE RENOVATIONS ARE GONNA ARE GONNA BE COMPLICATED -- BUT ALSO A GREAT OPPORTUNITY IN TERMS OF ITS LOCATION IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A ROAD MAP FOR PROJECTS LIKE THAT -- SO THAT WE CAN PERHAPS FOCUS SOME ENERGY ON GETTING -- GETTING THOSE FUNDED BECAUSE IT DOES SEEM LIKE A TRICKLE OF MONEY -- AND AND THE TIMELINE FOR REALLY DOING SOME GOOD ON THIS ISSUE. IF WE IF WE WERE TO THINK ABOUT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE MONIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE A HUNDRED YEAR PRO CRAP. WE CERTAINLY DON'T THINK IT'S A HUNDRED YEAR PROGRAM AND THAT WILL PROVIDE YOUR OFFICE WITH THE ACTUAL ASSESSMENT BECAUSE THAT IDENTIFIED BOTH SORT OF SHORT TERM PRIORITIES AND LONGER TERM PRIORITY PROJECTS. WORKING WITH THE LANDOWNERS STUFF WHO'S WILLING AND AND KIND OF HOW FAR ALONG ARE THOSE PROJECTS SO I WE THINK THERE'S PROJECTS THAT ARE READY TO GO AND AND THEN SOME THAT ARE GOING TO REQUIRE MORE DEVELOPMENT.
